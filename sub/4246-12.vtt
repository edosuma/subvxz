WEBVTT

00:01.967 --> 00:03.250
If you will have me,

00:03.485 --> 00:05.485
I would very much like
to marry you.

00:05.520 --> 00:06.903
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:06.938 --> 00:08.422
(Huck) If he's alive,
she's not done.

00:08.456 --> 00:09.622
She's coming back
to finish the job.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.291
It's not over!

00:11.309 --> 00:13.243
- What's your name?
- Does it matter?

00:13.277 --> 00:15.829
- What do you want?
- I want a divorce.

00:15.863 --> 00:17.230
Does he deserve to be president?

00:17.264 --> 00:18.749
Do you think he can
win it on his own?

00:18.783 --> 00:20.467
If you can say "yes" to both,

00:20.501 --> 00:23.637
then we'll never discuss
election rigging ever again.

00:23.671 --> 00:25.689
(Breath quavers) Yes.

00:26.874 --> 00:27.974
It's a go.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.430
We are very excited and proud

00:34.464 --> 00:37.249
to be the first county
in the state of Ohio

00:37.267 --> 00:40.536
to use brand-new
touch-screen voting.

00:40.587 --> 00:42.855
Before the polls open
tomorrow morning,

00:42.889 --> 00:46.542
we will insert these
memory cards into the machines.

00:46.593 --> 00:49.729
They will store
and tabulate the votes.

00:49.763 --> 00:52.348
No paper ballots
to be collected this year.

00:52.382 --> 00:55.434
Now, that's progress.
All right, everybody.

00:55.469 --> 00:56.719
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
Now I'm going to show you

00:56.753 --> 00:58.254
over to the polling place

00:58.305 --> 01:01.140
so we can demonstrate
the voting machine

01:01.158 --> 01:03.242
and how it's used.

01:03.276 --> 01:05.878
The software has been
tested all the time.

01:05.896 --> 01:09.281
We don't anticipate
any problems...

01:10.316 --> 01:13.618
(Cell phone rings)

01:13.652 --> 01:15.670
- Hey.
- Guess who you are talking to.

01:15.704 --> 01:17.972
- My girlfriend?
- In addition to your girlfriend.

01:18.023 --> 01:19.441
A lawyer, Jesse.
You're talking

01:19.492 --> 01:20.692
- to a lawyer.
- You passed the bar.

01:20.726 --> 01:22.510
(Laughs)
Wait, so how's Palo Alto?

01:22.545 --> 01:24.396
Are those venture capitalists
gonna give you any money?

01:24.414 --> 01:28.266
It's looking good.
We'll know for sure tomorrow.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.603
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

01:31.637 --> 01:34.639
sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

01:36.025 --> 01:38.193
(projector and camera
shutter clicking)

01:38.244 --> 01:40.311
Sorry, I don't have enough
seating for you all.

01:40.329 --> 01:42.497
For what they charge me
by the hour, they can stand.

01:42.531 --> 01:44.115
I've asked you here,
Mr. Doyle,

01:44.149 --> 01:46.000
because my continuing
investigation

01:46.035 --> 01:47.819
into the Cytron
explosion case

01:47.837 --> 01:49.204
has led me
to an unexpected finding...

01:49.255 --> 01:51.989
Namely that the explosion
at Cytron was linked

01:52.007 --> 01:54.008
to a scheme to manipulate
the most recent election

01:54.043 --> 01:56.628
- for President of the United States.
- Do tell.

01:56.662 --> 01:58.463
The explosion was an attempt
at a cover-up.

01:58.497 --> 02:00.148
I have reason to believe
that you were a participant

02:00.182 --> 02:01.382
in this conspiracy.

02:01.433 --> 02:03.268
I also believe you had
co-conspirators,

02:03.302 --> 02:04.886
possibly ones
in the very highest reaches

02:04.937 --> 02:06.354
of the White House.

02:06.388 --> 02:07.939
I'll be talking to these
other individuals,

02:07.973 --> 02:08.973
prepared to make a deal

02:09.007 --> 02:10.608
in exchange
for their cooperation

02:10.643 --> 02:12.527
in revealing the details
of this scheme

02:12.561 --> 02:14.062
to rig the election
and subvert the will

02:14.113 --> 02:15.363
of the American people.

02:15.397 --> 02:17.031
But there's only one
seat in the lifeboat.

02:17.066 --> 02:18.616
You have until the end
of the week to decide

02:18.651 --> 02:20.568
if you want to take it.

02:20.619 --> 02:22.654
What's left
of your reputation,

02:22.688 --> 02:24.239
not to mention
your future ability

02:24.290 --> 02:26.241
to make so much as a nickel
practicing law

02:26.292 --> 02:27.909
anywhere in this great land,
is presently hanging

02:27.960 --> 02:29.911
by an itty-bitty thread.

02:29.945 --> 02:34.549
I expect you know how
we turn bulls into steers.

02:34.583 --> 02:37.218
Don't make me haul out
the clippers.

02:37.253 --> 02:38.419
Gentlemen.

02:38.470 --> 02:43.424
(Door opens)

02:43.509 --> 02:44.926
You need to get your guy
under control,

02:44.977 --> 02:46.561
because I am not gonna
sit here and let him

02:46.595 --> 02:48.596
- yank the wheels off this thing!
- Good morning, Mellie.

02:48.647 --> 02:50.648
Pregnancy gives you
such a glow of warmth.

02:50.683 --> 02:52.851
Cyrus, do your job
and get your guy in line!

02:52.885 --> 02:56.154
Okay, "a", I have no idea what you're
so angry about... (Inhales sharply)

02:56.188 --> 02:58.439
And, two, he is not <i>my</i> guy,
he is <i>our</i> guy.

02:58.490 --> 03:00.191
We share custody.
I get the weekdays,

03:00.225 --> 03:02.527
and every third Saturday
you get...

03:02.561 --> 03:04.913
He asked me for a divorce!

03:06.565 --> 03:08.116
Say something!

03:08.167 --> 03:09.868
He asked you for a divorce?

03:09.902 --> 03:12.086
- Is he insane?
- Yes, he is insane.

03:12.121 --> 03:13.454
He got shot,
and he saw the light

03:13.505 --> 03:15.707
and baby Jesus or whatever,
and now he thinks

03:15.741 --> 03:17.425
he can do anything he wants!

03:17.459 --> 03:19.460
Fix him, Cyrus,
or I swear to God...

03:19.511 --> 03:20.795
I'll get into it.

03:20.846 --> 03:22.096
(Sighs)

03:22.131 --> 03:24.916
Mellie...

03:24.934 --> 03:27.135
It never stops.

03:27.186 --> 03:28.720
I am so tired.

03:28.754 --> 03:31.589
He's not getting a divorce.
Everything's going to be okay.

03:31.607 --> 03:33.591
- Go. Get some rest.
- Oh.

03:33.609 --> 03:36.778
- A lot of this has to be
pregnancy hormones. - (Sighs)

03:36.812 --> 03:39.197
- Maybe you should see the doctor.
- (Sighs)

03:39.231 --> 03:41.149
Eh?
You look a little pale.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.569
Okay.
Thank you, Cyrus.

03:44.603 --> 03:46.237
Oh...

03:47.373 --> 03:48.623
(Whispers) Breeders.

03:48.657 --> 03:51.743
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

03:52.461 --> 03:55.129
It's a ring.
She's staring at a ring.

03:55.164 --> 03:56.447
It is not.
Let me see.

03:58.384 --> 04:00.001
(Exhales deeply)

04:00.052 --> 04:01.719
Do you think
Edison proposed?

04:01.754 --> 04:04.121
Wife of a senator.
Not too shabby.

04:04.139 --> 04:06.090
Please.
Husband of Olivia Pope.

04:06.124 --> 04:07.675
(Door opens)

04:07.726 --> 04:10.011
(Door closes) I'll take mine
black with three sugars.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.847
You.

04:12.898 --> 04:16.067
I'm sorry, darling. Have we met?
I'm here to see Liv.

04:17.769 --> 04:20.071
Olivia's not here.

04:20.105 --> 04:22.440
(Olivia) Huck.
It's okay.

04:24.026 --> 04:26.577
It appears we still have
a David Rosen problem,

04:26.612 --> 04:28.663
which means you now have
a Hollis Doyle problem.

04:28.697 --> 04:30.331
Because I seem to recall
you were supposed

04:30.366 --> 04:31.666
to fix this some time ago...

04:31.700 --> 04:33.317
And fixing's supposed
to be your business!

04:33.335 --> 04:36.320
I've been a little busy, Hollis,
what with managing the fallout

04:36.338 --> 04:38.289
from the attempted assassination
of the president.

04:38.323 --> 04:40.258
How's Fitz doing anyway?

04:40.292 --> 04:42.210
Send him my best.

04:42.261 --> 04:44.328
Must be a letdown
seeing him back in office,

04:44.346 --> 04:47.298
given how chummy you got
with Sally Langston.

04:47.332 --> 04:49.217
Oh, you know me, darling.

04:49.268 --> 04:50.802
I can get along
with everyone.

04:50.836 --> 04:53.404
New boss,
same as the old boss.

04:53.439 --> 04:55.974
That sense of personal loyalty
is so touching.

04:56.008 --> 04:57.759
I don't know what's
bunching your panties,

04:57.793 --> 04:59.877
but you need to fix this.

04:59.912 --> 05:01.879
For real this time,
and right quick,

05:01.914 --> 05:03.931
'cause make no mistake...
If it comes to it,

05:03.966 --> 05:06.200
I'll grab that seat
in that lifeboat, and you,

05:06.251 --> 05:09.153
Mellie, verna, your boy Cyrus,
and your precious Fitz

05:09.188 --> 05:12.689
are gonna be the ones stranded
on that sinking ship of state.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.912
(Door opens and closes)

05:19.263 --> 05:21.331
Cyrus, if we go
for gun control now,

05:21.365 --> 05:23.483
the N.R.A. can't fight back,
am I right?

05:23.517 --> 05:25.535
You are right, Mr. President.

05:25.569 --> 05:27.837
Everyone, we need the room.
Now.

05:27.872 --> 05:30.790
(Indistinct conversations)

05:31.926 --> 05:35.328
You know what I love
about this job?

05:35.363 --> 05:37.097
It's all big ideas.

05:37.148 --> 05:39.466
(Door closes) I get to have the big
ideas, and your job is to make sure

05:39.500 --> 05:41.583
everybody works on the
details to make it happen.

05:41.601 --> 05:43.152
It's... remarkable, really.

05:43.670 --> 05:45.321
- How are you feeling, sir?
- How am I feeling?

05:45.355 --> 05:47.106
I ask because you took
a bullet to the head

05:47.141 --> 05:48.324
not too long ago.

05:48.342 --> 05:50.259
And one of the possible
side effects

05:50.294 --> 05:51.511
of an injury to the...

05:51.545 --> 05:52.979
I think it's called
the prefrontal cortex...

05:53.030 --> 05:54.514
is recklessness,
a predilection

05:54.548 --> 05:56.582
for making
bold declarations...

05:56.617 --> 05:58.518
Declarations like,

05:58.552 --> 06:00.503
"I want to torpedo
my political career

06:00.537 --> 06:02.505
- by divorcing my wife."
- Cyrus.

06:02.639 --> 06:05.657
Another common side
effect is delusion.

06:05.692 --> 06:07.376
Maybe you're having that.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.678
One hell of a grade "A" delusion

06:09.712 --> 06:13.232
that makes you believe
that while in office

06:13.266 --> 06:17.586
you could divorce your
nine-months-pregnant wife

06:17.720 --> 06:19.271
and... what?

06:19.305 --> 06:20.772
Kick her out
of the White House

06:20.807 --> 06:22.657
and move in your mistress?

06:22.692 --> 06:26.027
No, you can't think that,
because we're not French.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.563
Marry your mistress?

06:28.597 --> 06:31.883
Now, Liv is a lovely,
smart woman.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.619
I can't get enough of her.
But she is not exactly a hue

06:34.670 --> 06:36.771
that most of your
republican constituents

06:36.805 --> 06:38.906
would be happy about,
even if they could get past

06:38.941 --> 06:41.092
the divorcing and the cheating
and the abandoning

06:41.126 --> 06:42.743
of America's baby.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.763
It concerns me, sir,
how big your delusion is.

06:50.185 --> 06:52.737
(Chuckles)

06:55.206 --> 06:57.490
Here's what's great

06:57.508 --> 07:00.160
about having someone
attempt to assassinate you.

07:00.194 --> 07:01.912
You're being rushed
somewhere on a gurney,

07:01.946 --> 07:03.597
and doctors are yelling,

07:03.631 --> 07:05.482
and blood is pouring out
of you, and you could die.

07:05.533 --> 07:09.002
And you suddenly stop
being afraid.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.289
Of anything. Or anyone.

07:12.323 --> 07:13.840
And when you don't die,

07:13.874 --> 07:16.176
when you miraculously live,

07:16.210 --> 07:20.330
you realize that you
have nothing to lose

07:20.365 --> 07:22.966
and no time to waste.

07:23.701 --> 07:25.985
This is going to happen, Cyrus.

07:26.003 --> 07:28.338
I am going to divorce Mellie,

07:28.372 --> 07:31.541
and I am going to remain
President of the United States

07:31.592 --> 07:33.009
after I do so.

07:33.043 --> 07:36.212
That is today's big idea.

07:36.263 --> 07:37.680
That's my job.

07:37.715 --> 07:39.349
Do your job.

07:39.383 --> 07:41.050
Work out the details.

07:41.101 --> 07:43.603
(Pats shoulder)
Make it happen.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:59.041 --> 07:59.990
As soon as my options vest,

08:00.024 --> 08:01.292
I'm out of here.

08:01.326 --> 08:03.828
Bye-bye, Cytron, hello, Jesse-tron.
(Laughs)

08:03.862 --> 08:05.079
You can't leave.

08:05.113 --> 08:06.764
Who am I gonna de-bug with
on a Friday night?

08:06.798 --> 08:08.632
When I start my company,
you'll be the first hire.

08:08.666 --> 08:11.369
Of course, you'll have to
start coming in on time.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.554
- Ready for lunch, babe?
- Hey. Linds.

08:15.140 --> 08:16.907
Is he really leaving?

08:16.941 --> 08:19.126
Six months.
That's the plan.

08:19.161 --> 08:21.095
Everything okay, Jess?

08:21.146 --> 08:22.563
(Taps keyboard)

08:22.597 --> 08:24.265
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

08:25.399 --> 08:28.018
I am being calm, Mr. Doyle!

08:28.452 --> 08:29.969
No, I don't think
a million was enough!

08:30.020 --> 08:32.489
Because you're making
$2 <i>billion</i> off of this deal!

08:32.523 --> 08:34.090
That's $2 billion more
than you would have made

08:34.124 --> 08:35.542
if these guys
weren't in power!

08:35.576 --> 08:37.076
Hey, you.

08:39.964 --> 08:41.881
(Lowered voice)
I want another $5 million,

08:41.916 --> 08:44.116
or I'm gonna start
calling reporters.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.702
No. Listen to me... hello?
(Line disconnects)

08:46.720 --> 08:48.488
Damn it!

08:49.039 --> 08:51.056
- What happened? What's the matter?
- Nothing. It's just...

08:51.091 --> 08:52.274
Crap.
Is that...

08:52.309 --> 08:53.726
I think it might be fried.

08:55.545 --> 08:57.463
Damn it!

08:58.097 --> 08:59.248
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

08:59.283 --> 09:01.550
We can't go directly
to justice on this.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.402
President's office can't
seem like we're influencing.

09:03.436 --> 09:05.320
Okay, I'll reach out to the
Attorney General on this,

09:05.355 --> 09:06.605
but I don't know
how much I can do

09:06.639 --> 09:08.006
and still keep this
under the radar.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.691
What do they know exactly?

09:09.726 --> 09:12.160
And more importantly,
how do they know it?

09:12.195 --> 09:13.962
Hollis say anything
about that, Liv?

09:14.697 --> 09:18.116
Who in their right mind
offers Hollis Doyle a deal,

09:18.167 --> 09:21.502
and who in holy hell does
David Rosen think he is?!

09:21.537 --> 09:22.904
The good guy.

09:24.907 --> 09:26.758
David Rosen is the good guy.

09:26.809 --> 09:29.544
Olivia...

09:29.578 --> 09:31.112
You have to stay the course.

09:31.146 --> 09:34.515
- Olivia. - He is the good guy,
and we are the bad guys.

09:34.550 --> 09:36.084
Everyone is a good guy
to someone.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.435
Just depends
on the point of view

09:37.486 --> 09:38.970
or your political affiliation.

09:39.004 --> 09:40.221
We made a mistake, Cyrus.

09:40.256 --> 09:41.906
No, we did not.

09:41.941 --> 09:43.942
Okay. <i>I</i> made a mistake.

09:43.976 --> 09:47.045
I sat on that plane,
and I voted "yes."

09:47.079 --> 09:49.964
And ever since...

09:49.999 --> 09:53.701
(Sighs) Oh, I made a mistake,
and it's...

09:54.836 --> 09:56.787
I don't do things like that.

09:56.821 --> 09:58.505
I fix things.

09:58.539 --> 10:00.340
That is who I am.
I should have fixed it

10:00.408 --> 10:02.559
so there wasn't even a reason
to vote on that plane.

10:02.610 --> 10:05.679
If I hadn't been emotionally
involved with Fitz,

10:05.713 --> 10:08.448
if I had kept it together,
I would have fixed it.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.084
- Olivia...
- We should never have done it.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.871
And now...
We're the bad guys,

10:14.906 --> 10:17.924
and I don't know
how to fix that.

10:19.059 --> 10:22.161
And I have been running
and running

10:22.195 --> 10:23.445
to stay out of it.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.531
And I'm tired,

10:25.565 --> 10:28.951
and I don't know
what to do next.

10:28.985 --> 10:30.636
Look at me.

10:32.138 --> 10:33.472
Hey.

10:33.490 --> 10:36.108
You don't have to fix anything.

10:36.142 --> 10:38.210
You don't have to
think about it.

10:38.745 --> 10:40.578
I'm in charge now.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.597
I'll fix it.

10:42.632 --> 10:44.433
Cyrus...

10:44.467 --> 10:47.019
You're not yourself.

10:47.053 --> 10:48.720
The man you love almost died.

10:48.755 --> 10:51.656
You haven't had a chance
to process that yet.

10:52.825 --> 10:55.043
Go home and get some sleep.

10:55.078 --> 10:58.046
(Exhales sharply)

10:58.881 --> 11:00.398
What about Hollis?

11:00.432 --> 11:02.166
Hollis Doyle is now my problem.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.652
Consider it handled.

11:07.038 --> 11:09.624
<i>(Fitz) I can't just stop,</i>
<i>can you?</i>

11:09.658 --> 11:11.092
(Moans)

11:11.126 --> 11:12.910
- So you're...
- In.

11:12.945 --> 11:14.311
It's a go.

11:14.329 --> 11:16.664
It's me... Olivia.
We're gonna lose this thing.

11:16.698 --> 11:18.149
(Verna) I won't lie, Liv.

11:18.183 --> 11:19.483
There's a part of me that
wishes we'd let her hang.

11:19.501 --> 11:21.769
- She didn't ask for any of it.
- Let her hang.

11:21.820 --> 11:23.454
(Rosen) - I know you did it.
- <i>We're gonna lose this thing.</i>

11:23.488 --> 11:26.239
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna find out.

11:26.274 --> 11:28.158
- Her ex-husband used to beat her.
- <i>She didn't ask for any of it.</i>

11:28.193 --> 11:29.843
You might want to use that.

11:29.877 --> 11:31.227
<i>It's a go.</i>
<i>(Rosen) I'm gonna find out.</i>

11:31.245 --> 11:32.229
<i>(Hollis)</i>
<i>There's no turning away</i>

11:32.263 --> 11:33.397
<i>if things get a tad messy.</i>

11:33.415 --> 11:35.666
<i>It's a go.</i>
<i>You're living in a fantasy.</i>

11:35.700 --> 11:38.536
<i>(Overlapping voices echoing)</i>

11:40.470 --> 11:44.590
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

11:44.624 --> 11:46.725
(Telephone rings)

11:46.760 --> 11:49.628
(Ring)

11:49.663 --> 11:52.364
(Ring)

11:52.399 --> 11:55.234
(Ring)

11:55.268 --> 11:57.837
(Ring)

12:00.457 --> 12:01.624
(Weakly) Hello?

12:01.658 --> 12:03.626
Olivia?

12:03.660 --> 12:05.261
Yes.

12:05.295 --> 12:08.864
I just... wanted to hear
your voice.

12:08.899 --> 12:11.200
And I have some news.

12:15.839 --> 12:17.739
What's wrong?

12:17.874 --> 12:20.541
Something's wrong.
I know you well enough to know.

12:20.559 --> 12:22.310
You don't know.

12:22.344 --> 12:24.929
You don't know who I am.

12:24.963 --> 12:26.747
You don't know me.

12:26.782 --> 12:28.683
Livvie...

12:28.717 --> 12:30.868
Edison asked me
to marry him.

12:30.903 --> 12:33.871
He gave me a ring.

12:33.922 --> 12:35.406
Livvie.

12:35.441 --> 12:37.959
I could... quit,

12:37.993 --> 12:41.295
go have some babies.

12:41.330 --> 12:44.432
Live in the country
or something.

12:44.466 --> 12:45.783
Make jam.

12:47.302 --> 12:48.669
Make jam?

12:48.704 --> 12:50.638
Have a normal life.

12:50.672 --> 12:52.907
Get some normal.

12:52.941 --> 12:55.409
I asked Mellie for a divorce.

13:00.332 --> 13:02.149
Listen to me.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.118
Whatever's wrong,
we'll fix it.

13:05.153 --> 13:08.104
Don't say you're
marrying Edison.

13:08.139 --> 13:10.274
Not yet.
Just... wait, okay?

13:10.275 --> 13:12.159
Whatever's wrong,
we'll fix it.

13:12.193 --> 13:14.661
Just say you'll
wait for me.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.781
Liv?

13:19.684 --> 13:21.551
Say you'll wait for me.

13:31.262 --> 13:33.447
(Dial tone)
(Sighs)

13:51.664 --> 13:53.098
Olivia?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.304
Olivia, what's wrong?
You okay?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.105
Are you... are you sick?
Can I get you anything?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.007
(Weakly) Go away, please.

14:02.041 --> 14:02.958
What?

14:03.393 --> 14:06.895
Go... away, please.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.033
Liv?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.301
(Camera shutter clicking)
(Edison) - She won't get out of bed.

14:30.319 --> 14:31.653
She won't tell me why.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.221
She doesn't want anything
to do with anyone.

14:33.255 --> 14:36.107
I can't help her.
She won't let me help her.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.876
I don't know what to...

14:37.910 --> 14:42.797
Look... she doesn't talk to me
the way that she talks to you.

14:42.848 --> 14:45.767
You're her family.
You see her every day.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.085
You know her.
You understand her.

14:48.103 --> 14:51.055
So, please, talk to her.

14:51.089 --> 14:52.607
Help her.

14:52.641 --> 14:53.808
I have to go.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.128
I should be on the floor
of the senate right now.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.030
(Door closes)

15:01.549 --> 15:03.684
I think we found
our next client.

15:05.103 --> 15:06.587
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

15:13.772 --> 15:15.655
Everything's going
according to plan.

15:15.673 --> 15:18.826
(Beep) Well, of course
you can expect results.

15:18.860 --> 15:20.894
I even found a perfect patsy.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.982
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

15:25.016 --> 15:28.569
Yes, Mr. Doyle.
We are definitely a go.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.254
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

15:31.288 --> 15:32.639
Look, I know.

15:32.706 --> 15:34.174
We don't ask questions.
We don't talk.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.842
We just gladiate.
That's the rule.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.193
But it's not working.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.045
Everyone in this room
knows things

15:39.079 --> 15:40.563
the rest of us don't know.

15:40.597 --> 15:42.365
Everyone in this room has secrets.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.799
If we put all the secrets
together,

15:43.850 --> 15:45.985
- maybe we figure it out.
- Figure <i>what</i> out?

15:46.019 --> 15:47.620
Why Olivia hasn't
turned in Hollis Doyle

15:47.654 --> 15:49.021
for shooting the president.

15:49.055 --> 15:50.289
I don't want to know.
It's not my job to know.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.824
Which is the problem.
We're blindly loyal.

15:52.842 --> 15:55.393
- We're Liv's little army.
- And what, you're gonna set us free?

15:55.411 --> 15:57.479
She wants to help Olivia.
(Scoffs)

15:57.513 --> 15:59.447
Yes.
Okay, so can we all just agree

15:59.482 --> 16:01.550
that right now,
for one day,

16:01.584 --> 16:02.884
we each tell what we know?

16:02.919 --> 16:04.619
No hurt feelings,
no judgments,

16:04.654 --> 16:06.988
no repercussions, just a free
exchange of information

16:07.023 --> 16:08.456
in service of Olivia Pope.

16:08.507 --> 16:10.358
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:11.809 --> 16:13.710
(Exhales) - Huck?

16:13.745 --> 16:15.029
(Exhales)
All you have to do

16:15.080 --> 16:16.714
is let us know if anything
we say isn't true.

16:16.748 --> 16:18.483
Blink, cough, raise your hand.
It's totally up to you,

16:18.517 --> 16:20.251
but you have to let
us know, okay, buddy?

16:23.121 --> 16:25.539
- Huck's in, too.
- Who goes first?

16:27.342 --> 16:28.993
The night of the Cytron explosion,

16:29.027 --> 16:31.045
Huck shot me with etorphine,

16:31.096 --> 16:33.481
or M99, like the super spies say.

16:33.515 --> 16:35.449
(Muffled shouting)
<i>And it was only hours ago</i>

16:35.484 --> 16:37.885
<i>a deadly bomb exploded</i>
<i>at Cytron software company...</i>

16:37.919 --> 16:40.588
(Quinn) He took me from a
motel room in Petaluma

16:40.622 --> 16:43.774
to a hotel room here
in Washington, D.C.

16:43.792 --> 16:46.660
It was Huck who created
my new identity.

16:46.711 --> 16:49.397
Huck, if you're not saying
anything,

16:49.431 --> 16:52.516
then that means what
you're hearing is true.

16:53.150 --> 16:54.968
Think you could help me
save someone?

16:55.019 --> 16:56.886
Okay.

16:57.321 --> 16:59.555
Her name's Lindsay Dwyer.
She's in California.

16:59.590 --> 17:01.407
Okay.

17:02.476 --> 17:03.810
So you jammed a needle...

17:03.844 --> 17:06.162
- Abby.
- Right. Sorry.

17:06.195 --> 17:07.864
No judgments. Continue.

17:07.897 --> 17:10.031
(Quinn) Huck took me to D.C.
using a private plane.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.685
The plane was registered
to Verna Thornton.

17:12.719 --> 17:14.203
The supreme court justice?

17:14.238 --> 17:15.588
She's one of
Olivia's clients, right?

17:17.374 --> 17:20.526
If justice Thornton
was involved with Cytron,

17:20.560 --> 17:22.277
if she helped save you once

17:22.310 --> 17:23.928
by getting you
out of California,

17:23.963 --> 17:25.730
then she might have helped
save you a second time.

17:25.765 --> 17:27.415
You think she got to the
judge in Quinn's trial.

17:27.450 --> 17:29.217
A supreme court justice
asks for a favor,

17:29.251 --> 17:30.535
you don't turn her down.

17:30.569 --> 17:32.670
- What the hell?!
(Judge) - Order!

17:32.705 --> 17:34.305
(Gavel pounds)
- Your honor, on what grounds?!

17:34.340 --> 17:36.491
I think whoever framed me
for the Cytron bombing

17:36.525 --> 17:38.326
was angry at Huck for saving me,

17:38.360 --> 17:40.445
so they framed him for
shooting the president.

17:40.479 --> 17:42.563
And I think Hollis Doyle was
the person who framed me, so...

17:42.581 --> 17:44.182
I know Hollis Doyle was
the person who framed you.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.686
Your turn.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.705
(Sighs)

17:52.707 --> 17:53.774
I was...

17:53.808 --> 17:55.826
Sleeping with David Rosen.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.494
The man who wanted
to execute me?

17:57.529 --> 17:58.879
Hey! No judgments.

18:02.133 --> 18:03.517
(Sighs)

18:07.021 --> 18:10.139
David and I discovered that your
ex-Cytron employee boyfriend

18:10.174 --> 18:13.492
Jesse Tyler... he called
Hollis Doyle 11 times

18:13.510 --> 18:14.477
the week of the explosion.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.095
Why would Jesse
be calling Hollis Doyle?

18:16.130 --> 18:17.613
Voting machines.

18:17.648 --> 18:20.149
Jesse sold vote-rigging
software to Hollis.

18:20.184 --> 18:22.752
"The Doyle energy superpac
has donated millions

18:22.786 --> 18:24.387
"to ballot measures
in all five states.

18:24.421 --> 18:26.205
"The proposed pipeline
would pass through

18:26.240 --> 18:28.024
on its way from Canada
to the Gulf."

18:28.075 --> 18:31.294
Hollis was rigging votes to get
his oil pipeline approved.

18:31.328 --> 18:33.429
(Coughs twice)

18:33.464 --> 18:35.131
Hollis was rigging votes?

18:37.484 --> 18:38.685
For a pipeline?

18:38.719 --> 18:40.269
(Coughs twice)

18:45.241 --> 18:47.409
It's got nothing to do with
a pipeline. (Slaps table)

18:47.460 --> 18:49.928
(Exhales)

18:49.963 --> 18:51.580
Okay.

18:51.614 --> 18:53.849
We know Olivia was covering for
Hollis shooting the president.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.517
And if Hollis was the one
who blew up Cytron,

18:55.551 --> 18:57.135
she was covering that up, too.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.305
Obviously the man has something
on her...something big.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.140
And whatever it is,
it dates back

19:02.174 --> 19:03.758
to before the Cytron explosion.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.743
- When did Olivia and Hollis meet?
- On the grant campaign.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.746
They worked together
on the last election.

19:32.221 --> 19:34.856
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:36.290 --> 19:38.475
Okay, ma'am,
everything looks great.

19:38.509 --> 19:41.544
The baby is high.
Your cervix is closed.

19:41.579 --> 19:43.312
Doesn't look like he'll be here

19:43.331 --> 19:45.148
till right around your due date,

19:45.182 --> 19:46.666
which is in...

19:46.701 --> 19:48.134
Four weeks and three days.

19:48.169 --> 19:50.570
Exactly. Okay,
well, then, um... oh.

19:50.721 --> 19:53.939
We don't need it, but we
could do a 3D ultrasound,

19:53.973 --> 19:55.374
get you a look at your baby.

19:55.425 --> 19:57.576
Yeah, maybe even print out some
pictures for the president.

19:57.610 --> 19:59.361
- He's a busy man, isn't he?
- Yes.

19:59.395 --> 20:01.913
He hasn't been able to make it here
for any of your doctor's visits.

20:01.948 --> 20:03.248
Must be such a
disappointment for him.

20:03.283 --> 20:04.616
Yes.

20:04.651 --> 20:06.218
But he will be here for the birth.
Don't worry.

20:06.252 --> 20:08.570
Secret service put a plan
in place so he won't miss it.

20:09.004 --> 20:11.406
Was he there when Jerry
and Karen were born?

20:14.394 --> 20:16.295
He held my hand both times,

20:16.329 --> 20:18.230
got me to push
through the pain.

20:18.264 --> 20:20.966
Called me "champ," which
I hated, but it worked.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.786
Cut the cords.
So proud.

20:26.321 --> 20:28.539
I can't remember a time
when we were closer

20:28.573 --> 20:30.641
than in the delivery room.

20:32.126 --> 20:35.045
Both times, we were a team.

20:35.079 --> 20:38.248
Well, that sounds nice.

20:42.586 --> 20:45.872
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

20:45.906 --> 20:47.039
(Door closes)

20:57.334 --> 20:59.168
Hollis Doyle has to go.

20:59.203 --> 21:01.654
I can take care of that
for you if you want.

21:01.688 --> 21:04.424
Huck, you have to stop
killing people.

21:04.458 --> 21:05.958
Why?

21:05.993 --> 21:07.393
It solves the problem.

21:07.428 --> 21:08.945
You know why.

21:08.979 --> 21:12.465
Because killing people
is wrong.

21:12.499 --> 21:14.867
In certain circles,
that's not true, you know?

21:14.902 --> 21:18.104
In this circle,
in our circle, it's wrong.

21:18.138 --> 21:19.489
I need you to learn that.

21:19.523 --> 21:22.158
I'm not always
gonna be around.

21:24.144 --> 21:26.746
So what are you gonna do?
About Hollis?

21:27.880 --> 21:30.432
Cyrus Beene is taking care of it.

21:30.466 --> 21:32.934
Is he?

21:32.969 --> 21:35.337
Yeah.
So...

21:35.371 --> 21:37.906
You know,
don't worry about it.

21:37.940 --> 21:39.891
It's handled.

21:39.909 --> 21:43.144
Cyrus is handling it.

21:46.749 --> 21:48.149
What?

21:49.084 --> 21:52.669
Cyrus beene is not
in this circle, our circle.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.573
Cyrus is in <i>my</i> circle.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.342
No. Cyrus is the White
House chief of staff.

21:58.376 --> 22:00.060
- He'd never...
- If he said he's taking care of it...

22:00.111 --> 22:03.079
- Huck, I know Cyrus...
- He has a guy. You've met him.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.215
Charlie from B613.

22:08.970 --> 22:11.238
Oh, my God.

22:12.657 --> 22:15.142
Cyrus is going to kill
Hollis Doyle?

22:15.176 --> 22:17.177
Are you... (Breath quavers)
Are you sure?

22:21.583 --> 22:22.983
Oh, my God.

22:24.018 --> 22:25.586
(Exhales)

22:26.720 --> 22:28.321
Olivia.
(Monitor beeping)

22:28.355 --> 22:30.373
What a pleasant surprise.

22:32.843 --> 22:34.427
I'm turning him in.

22:34.461 --> 22:36.262
Hollis?

22:36.296 --> 22:38.531
I'll try to keep
election rigging out of it.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.549
Whether or not that's
possible, I don't know.

22:40.584 --> 22:42.852
Probably not,
since David Rosen

22:42.886 --> 22:45.605
is about to launch his official
investigation into defiance.

22:46.139 --> 22:47.940
- I thought we took care of that.
- Not well enough.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.329
He tried to kill Fitz, Verna.

22:54.364 --> 22:55.997
What does Cyrus have to say?

22:56.015 --> 22:59.234
Cyrus is exploring
a more permanent solution

22:59.269 --> 23:00.686
to our Hollis troubles.

23:00.737 --> 23:02.121
- I'll do what I can to protect you.
- No.

23:02.155 --> 23:03.505
- Verna...
- Look at me.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.358
There's nothing left to protect.

23:06.392 --> 23:08.527
The day I agreed
to election rigging

23:08.561 --> 23:11.480
is the day I signed
my death sentence.

23:11.514 --> 23:15.400
I've paid my price already.

23:16.452 --> 23:17.668
But you...

23:17.719 --> 23:20.154
You have a chance
at redemption.

23:20.188 --> 23:21.672
Take it.

23:24.659 --> 23:25.843
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

23:25.878 --> 23:27.795
Damn it!
Trixie!

23:27.829 --> 23:30.498
Don't ever talk me
into Sushi again!

23:30.516 --> 23:32.133
I've eaten a whole
plate of this stuff,

23:32.167 --> 23:33.634
and I'm still starvin'!

23:33.668 --> 23:37.138
Go to Gettysburger
and get me a general Lee

23:37.172 --> 23:38.806
with cheese and bacon!

23:40.392 --> 23:41.509
Trixie?

23:43.278 --> 23:44.529
What the hell is this?

23:44.563 --> 23:47.064
A warrant for the
search and seizure

23:47.115 --> 23:48.316
of any evidence relevant

23:48.350 --> 23:50.351
to the attempted assassination
of the President.

23:50.369 --> 23:53.687
Attempted assassination?
Are you out of your damn mind?

23:53.705 --> 23:55.356
Hey, easy!

23:55.407 --> 23:57.124
Sir.

23:57.159 --> 24:00.578
Whoa! Now hold on a second.

24:00.629 --> 24:02.663
I don't know what that is,
but it's not my phone.

24:02.697 --> 24:04.248
(Snaps shut)
You hear me?

24:04.299 --> 24:05.833
I'm talking to you.

24:07.202 --> 24:08.169
Got it.

24:08.203 --> 24:09.921
Bring him in.

24:11.039 --> 24:12.557
So what now?

24:12.591 --> 24:14.058
I question him,

24:14.092 --> 24:15.426
try to squeeze
a confession out of him.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.228
I have 48 hours
to file charges if I can.

24:17.262 --> 24:18.763
You let him go.

24:18.814 --> 24:20.348
Not that the phone isn't great.
The phone is lovely.

24:20.382 --> 24:22.099
Bless you for bringing it
to my attention,

24:22.150 --> 24:23.768
but it's not enough
to file charges.

24:23.819 --> 24:26.120
Not when you're Hollis Doyle
and own half the planet.

24:26.154 --> 24:27.721
For that I need evidence...

24:27.739 --> 24:30.724
Witness, proof of money
exchanging hands, motive.

24:30.742 --> 24:32.443
I'll do my best
with Hollis and Becky,

24:32.494 --> 24:34.445
but anything you can
bring to the table

24:34.496 --> 24:36.581
is much appreciated.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.201
I'll keep that in mind.

24:40.235 --> 24:42.453
But just so you know,

24:42.504 --> 24:44.238
this doesn't make us even.

24:44.256 --> 24:45.540
Not even close.

24:45.574 --> 24:47.675
And it won't stop me
from coming after you...

24:47.709 --> 24:50.511
Guns blazing, both barrels...
If it looks,

24:50.579 --> 24:51.929
as I strongly suspect,

24:51.964 --> 24:54.131
like you were involved
in illegal activity,

24:54.166 --> 24:57.084
or worse, if you try
to screw me again.

24:57.102 --> 24:59.920
In that case, God help you.

25:08.457 --> 25:09.924
What have you done?

25:09.959 --> 25:12.359
Why the hell is Hollis Doyle
in custody?

25:12.393 --> 25:14.194
What I had to
to make this right.

25:14.229 --> 25:15.478
I had a solution.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.164
And I chose another one.

25:17.198 --> 25:18.749
I told you
I would handle it.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.584
- How?!
- "How" is not the point!

25:20.618 --> 25:22.269
"How" is <i>exactly</i> the point!

25:22.303 --> 25:24.271
Hollis Doyle is a tumor
on this administration

25:24.305 --> 25:25.772
and on everything we built.

25:25.823 --> 25:27.724
He tried to kill Fitz.
How are you not wanting

25:27.742 --> 25:29.993
to rain vengeance down
upon that man?!

25:30.027 --> 25:31.695
I'm more interested in justice!

25:31.729 --> 25:33.196
Justice is for regular people!

25:33.231 --> 25:34.631
Justice is for fatty in Ohio

25:34.665 --> 25:36.099
folding their laundry
and drinking their beers.

25:36.133 --> 25:38.101
- We are not regular people!
- We are.

25:38.435 --> 25:39.769
We're the people.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.020
And if we're not, we should be,

25:41.071 --> 25:42.338
because that's what it means,
"we the people."

25:42.373 --> 25:43.940
It means all of us.

25:43.974 --> 25:46.009
Hollis should be
brought to justice.

25:46.043 --> 25:47.760
And if what we did gets out?

25:47.795 --> 25:50.797
Then it gets out,
and we're brought to justice.

25:51.131 --> 25:52.598
You're willing to bring down
the whole Republic

25:52.666 --> 25:54.050
because you feel guilty.

25:54.084 --> 25:57.203
You <i>know</i> what
our electoral process is!

25:57.237 --> 25:58.554
It's magical!

25:58.572 --> 26:00.039
It's like believing in Santa

26:00.090 --> 26:01.774
or the Tooth Fairy
or the Easter Bunny...

26:01.809 --> 26:03.759
Magical,
as long as they believe.

26:04.793 --> 26:06.945
What you're doing
is telling the people

26:06.979 --> 26:09.181
that the shiny presents
and the bulging stockings

26:09.215 --> 26:10.832
on Christmas morning
are just mom and dad

26:10.866 --> 26:12.517
staying up all night
to do the work.

26:12.568 --> 26:14.136
You're telling them
we're Santa,

26:14.170 --> 26:16.872
we're the Easter Bunny,
we're the Tooth Fairy.

26:16.906 --> 26:18.673
You're taking the magic away!

26:18.708 --> 26:20.358
You're ruining
Christmas morning,

26:20.393 --> 26:23.261
and the <i>whole Republic</i>
is gonna come crumbling down

26:23.296 --> 26:26.181
because you're not tough enough
to do what needs to be done!

26:27.683 --> 26:30.068
Get your house in order,
Cyrus,

26:30.102 --> 26:31.403
and hire a lawyer.

26:31.454 --> 26:34.022
A good one!

26:36.274 --> 26:37.858
And Olivia's turned
Hollis Doyle in

26:37.892 --> 26:39.777
for conspiracy to
assassinate the President.

26:39.811 --> 26:41.045
I don't understand.

26:41.079 --> 26:42.396
He's being held
and questioned.

26:42.414 --> 26:43.781
The thing she didn't
want to do,

26:43.815 --> 26:45.182
which we all wanted her to do,

26:45.233 --> 26:46.467
she's now gone ahead
and done?

26:46.501 --> 26:47.685
- That's correct.
- Why?

26:47.719 --> 26:48.936
- Doesn't matter.
- Yeah,

26:48.970 --> 26:50.871
see, that doesn't work
for me anymore.

26:50.905 --> 26:52.306
- She must have had her reasons.
- That, either.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.108
Olivia does want she
does when she wants,

26:54.142 --> 26:56.510
and no one dare question
or ask for an explanation.

26:56.544 --> 26:58.078
What do you want to know?

27:04.168 --> 27:06.119
I did things...

27:06.154 --> 27:10.307
Things that have affected your lives,
made life hard for each of you.

27:10.341 --> 27:12.526
I need to apologize for all of that.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.429
I was wrong, and I'm very sorry.

27:18.098 --> 27:20.683
And it's time for me
to come clean to you.

27:20.734 --> 27:22.952
To answer any and all
questions you have.

27:23.003 --> 27:24.220
I don't want to know.
Well, I do.

27:24.254 --> 27:25.421
No, you don't.

27:25.455 --> 27:26.822
'Cause that puts you
in legal jeopardy

27:26.873 --> 27:28.557
of being subpoenaed
and held as a material witness.

27:28.592 --> 27:30.442
You want to make that choice,
I'll leave the room.

27:30.477 --> 27:32.211
- I'll go with him.
- Me, too.

27:35.498 --> 27:37.516
Moment of truth.
You in or you out?

27:37.550 --> 27:40.085
On the team, or in the cold?

27:45.091 --> 27:46.759
What do you need us all to do?

27:47.693 --> 27:50.128
The phone... it's not enough
to tie back in Hollis.

27:50.162 --> 27:51.596
Can't the feds
give Becky a deal,

27:51.630 --> 27:52.930
- see if she'll name Hollis?
- Becky's not talking,

27:52.948 --> 27:54.766
but maybe Becky got paid.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.367
We follow the money trail.

27:56.402 --> 27:58.253
Find me a payment
from Hollis to Becky,

27:58.287 --> 28:00.471
I can make this stick.

28:03.675 --> 28:06.343
(Sighs) Where did you get
all this info?

28:06.378 --> 28:07.895
I took photos
of Becky's I.D's.

28:07.929 --> 28:08.913
It's all lies.

28:08.947 --> 28:10.347
Got a firm that handles
security for Doyle Energy.

28:10.366 --> 28:11.733
They farm out a lot of jobs

28:11.784 --> 28:13.117
to a myriad of mercenary firms
and individuals.

28:13.135 --> 28:15.319
Probably how he found Becky.

28:15.354 --> 28:16.537
David Rosen has been
building a case

28:16.572 --> 28:18.122
against Hollis and you
for months.

28:18.140 --> 28:19.657
You want me to talk to him, see
what else he's got on Hollis?

28:19.691 --> 28:21.943
I saw David. He's the one
I turned Hollis in to.

28:21.977 --> 28:24.078
You saw David?

28:25.130 --> 28:26.931
Okay.

28:26.965 --> 28:30.084
I'll keep at the superpac
filings, see where it leads.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.555
If Jesse used software
to rig the election,

28:35.606 --> 28:36.939
working for Hollis...

28:36.957 --> 28:38.759
If we can get into Jesse's
bank account, we can maybe

28:38.793 --> 28:40.377
see the payment Hollis
made to him,

28:40.411 --> 28:42.262
and then see if he used
the same account to pay Becky.

28:42.297 --> 28:44.230
Good idea.
Too bad you can't access

28:44.281 --> 28:45.849
a dead man's bank account.

28:45.883 --> 28:47.217
Maybe you can.

29:38.201 --> 29:40.786
Hi. I need to pick up
a laptop I dropped off.

29:41.620 --> 29:43.121
- What time?
- Two years ago.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.839
♪ Truly be

♪ shining star for you to see

- I can wait.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.145
First off, David,
I was just saying

29:58.179 --> 30:00.847
to the Attorney General here
you've done a great job

30:00.882 --> 30:03.867
keeping this out of
the public eye.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.786
Obviously,
if this were to get out...

30:05.820 --> 30:08.772
Prominent citizen,
friend of the White House...

30:09.406 --> 30:10.273
It would be calamitous.

30:10.307 --> 30:12.125
Nothing stops this town
like a scandal.

30:12.559 --> 30:13.943
We wouldn't get anything done...

30:13.994 --> 30:17.029
No legislation, nothing
on the international stage.

30:17.064 --> 30:18.565
Even if the man were innocent,

30:18.599 --> 30:20.600
it might take weeks or even months...
(Mouths word)

30:20.635 --> 30:22.202
Before we could gear up again.

30:23.236 --> 30:24.920
I would think that would
be a small price to pay

30:24.955 --> 30:26.488
if we find out
he <i>wasn't</i> innocent.

30:26.523 --> 30:28.207
I'm just giving you the White
House's point of view.

30:28.275 --> 30:30.593
Your investigation
is your investigation.

30:30.627 --> 30:33.912
The executive branch doesn't
have any influence on justice.

30:34.347 --> 30:36.347
And yet here we are.

30:36.366 --> 30:38.166
There are some concerns,
David.

30:38.217 --> 30:39.518
Yours or the chief of staff's?

30:39.552 --> 30:41.103
Mine, actually.

30:41.137 --> 30:42.270
I'm only asking because

30:42.305 --> 30:43.621
yesterday you didn't
have concerns.

30:43.639 --> 30:45.107
Yesterday you thought we might
have a pretty good case.

30:45.158 --> 30:46.625
We had a burner phone
in Hollis Doyle's desk

30:46.659 --> 30:48.643
that had only one number on it...

30:48.695 --> 30:49.911
A number that belonged
to the assassin.

30:50.446 --> 30:52.363
It allegedly had
only one number on it.

30:52.398 --> 30:53.865
There's no "allegedly" about it.

30:53.899 --> 30:55.967
We checked the phone log.
It had one number on it.

30:56.001 --> 30:58.186
You're not talking to a bunch
of reporters right now, Susan.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.421
No, but at some point
in the very near future,

31:00.472 --> 31:02.657
I probably will be talking
to reporters, David.

31:02.691 --> 31:04.859
And those reporters
are going to ask me

31:04.894 --> 31:07.644
about how long we plan
to detain Mr. Doyle

31:07.679 --> 31:08.663
without charging him.

31:08.697 --> 31:11.082
How long we plan to detain him?
You tell me.

31:11.116 --> 31:12.600
What's the standard amount
of time you keep a man

31:12.651 --> 31:14.702
- who might have tried to kill
the president? - 48 hours.

31:14.736 --> 31:18.372
I'm not a lawyer, but...
that sounds fair, doesn't it?

31:18.407 --> 31:20.224
I think Cyrus just wants to know

31:20.259 --> 31:21.676
whether or not anything
is to be gained

31:21.710 --> 31:24.761
by detaining Mr. Doyle
for much longer.

31:25.897 --> 31:28.398
Again, folks,
this is your call.

31:28.416 --> 31:29.883
I'm just a sounding board.

31:33.637 --> 31:35.488
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

31:35.523 --> 31:36.789
These are Jesse's
financial records.

31:36.824 --> 31:39.042
- Barely even password-protected.
- Is that...

31:39.076 --> 31:41.261
A Cayman bank account with
million-dollar deposit in it.

31:41.295 --> 31:43.012
- Boy got paid.
- Look at the date.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.631
A day after the election.

31:44.665 --> 31:46.416
Can we trace the deposit
back to Hollis?

31:46.450 --> 31:47.734
We can trace it
to a routing number.

31:47.768 --> 31:49.202
Becky has an account
with a deposit made

31:49.253 --> 31:50.470
using the same
routing number.

31:50.504 --> 31:51.988
We'll have proof
that Hollis Doyle

31:52.022 --> 31:53.673
paid Becky to assassinate
the president.

31:54.507 --> 31:56.525
Assuming we can find
Becky's bank account.

31:56.559 --> 31:58.210
Which we can't.
It's a needle in a haystack.

31:58.244 --> 32:00.012
She's too much of a pro.

32:00.063 --> 32:01.397
Unless...
(Taps keys)

32:01.431 --> 32:03.082
Unless what?

32:03.116 --> 32:05.133
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

32:05.451 --> 32:06.701
What's this about?

32:06.719 --> 32:08.153
This is about me
and my fellow counsel

32:08.187 --> 32:09.637
being afforded access
to our client.

32:09.656 --> 32:11.206
Prisoner declined
representation.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.641
She declined a public defender.

32:12.675 --> 32:14.326
She's upgraded...
to the dream team.

32:25.003 --> 32:27.855
(Keys rattling) I didn't
know you went to law school.

32:27.873 --> 32:29.456
(Handcuffs clicking)

32:29.475 --> 32:31.559
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

32:33.762 --> 32:35.429
(Clicking)

32:35.447 --> 32:37.698
- I need your bank account.
- What bank account?

32:37.732 --> 32:38.983
The bank account
you keep your money in.

32:38.984 --> 32:41.335
So you can find out
who paid me? Pass.

32:41.370 --> 32:43.020
No, so I can hire you a lawyer.

32:43.071 --> 32:44.822
This coming from the
man who set me up.

32:44.856 --> 32:46.824
- That was business.
- Please.

32:46.858 --> 32:48.642
You hate me with every
bone in your body.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.211
- No. - I killed your family, Huck.
How could you not?

32:51.245 --> 32:53.363
Because I cast
the first stone.

32:54.298 --> 32:55.348
Cytron.

32:55.383 --> 32:56.866
Who told you?

32:56.917 --> 32:58.752
I figured it out.

33:04.759 --> 33:06.109
Here you go.

33:07.428 --> 33:10.547
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

33:17.488 --> 33:19.656
(People screaming
and shouting indistinctly)

33:19.690 --> 33:22.225
(Woman) 9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

33:22.276 --> 33:23.744
I just saw that girl
from the news...

33:23.778 --> 33:25.762
The one that blew up that building.

33:25.813 --> 33:27.998
She's at the Star Mesa motel...

33:37.759 --> 33:40.310
You ruined a perfect job.

33:41.544 --> 33:42.811
Let me make it up to you.

33:42.846 --> 33:45.014
By hiring me a lawyer?

33:45.048 --> 33:46.982
- What's he gonna do for me?
- Nothing.

33:47.033 --> 33:49.184
You're gonna die, and there's
nothing I can do to stop that.

33:49.219 --> 33:51.086
- So why?
- For me.

33:51.137 --> 33:53.405
So I can visit you.
He can arrange that.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.757
But he has to be good.

33:54.791 --> 33:57.642
- And good costs money.
- The bank account?

33:59.696 --> 34:02.681
(Scoffs) I'm supposed to trust you?
Why?

34:03.215 --> 34:04.615
Because you gave me your word?

34:06.719 --> 34:08.820
Because I gave you my name.

34:24.420 --> 34:27.871
You're the only person
I can be myself with.

34:30.775 --> 34:32.259
Don't make me say good-bye.

34:37.849 --> 34:39.650
(Exhales)

34:45.473 --> 34:47.306
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

34:49.994 --> 34:52.612
(Door closes) Fitz is
serious about the divorce.

34:53.347 --> 34:54.647
Of course he is.

34:54.681 --> 34:56.632
And Olivia gave up
Hollis to the feds.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.467
What?

34:58.485 --> 35:00.203
He's in custody.
(Exhales deeply)

35:00.237 --> 35:01.804
You're supposed
to hate the woman.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.240
Isn't that the standard trope?
The seductress, the slut,

35:04.274 --> 35:06.208
the tramp who
led your man astray.

35:06.226 --> 35:07.393
And I do.

35:07.427 --> 35:09.779
I <i>loathe</i> Olivia Pope.

35:09.813 --> 35:11.397
But it's a boring
sort of hate.

35:11.431 --> 35:12.815
Uninteresting, cliche.

35:12.833 --> 35:16.869
It's hard to even get my back into it.
But... Fitz?

35:16.904 --> 35:19.205
I found him.

35:19.239 --> 35:22.074
I cleaned him up
after that monster

35:22.109 --> 35:24.043
who raised him
damaged his spirit.

35:24.127 --> 35:27.729
I am the one who told him
he was someone.

35:27.763 --> 35:29.364
I am the one
who cheered him on

35:29.398 --> 35:31.533
and listened to him ramble
about his hopes and his dreams.

35:31.567 --> 35:33.285
I am the one who focused him.

35:33.336 --> 35:34.719
I did all the work!

35:34.770 --> 35:37.522
I did all the work, and now
she gets to reap the benefits?

35:37.557 --> 35:39.207
No. No!
I made him.

35:39.242 --> 35:41.409
He exists because
I say he exists!

35:41.427 --> 35:42.794
Mellie...

35:42.845 --> 35:44.078
(Exhales)

35:44.096 --> 35:46.298
I can handle the Hollis thing.
(Sighs)

35:46.349 --> 35:47.966
But Fitz...
Since the shooting,

35:48.017 --> 35:50.135
Fitz is an enigma to me.

35:50.186 --> 35:52.304
So if you have anything...
A card to play,

35:52.355 --> 35:56.391
one last trick up your sleeve,
now's the time, Mellie.

36:01.430 --> 36:02.931
(Indistinct conversations)

36:02.949 --> 36:05.033
Ma'am.
Is everything okay?

36:05.067 --> 36:06.785
It will be.

36:07.937 --> 36:09.287
(Closes)

36:09.322 --> 36:11.656
It's me. I'm still working
on getting him out,

36:11.707 --> 36:13.608
but it shouldn't be
much longer. Just...

36:13.626 --> 36:15.944
The minute he's released?
Make it look like an accident.

36:15.962 --> 36:18.380
Copy that.

36:31.912 --> 36:33.362
(Abby) Why didn't Becky
just give you her P.I.N.?

36:33.396 --> 36:35.581
Offshore account, the P.I.N.
regenerates every 48 hours.

36:35.615 --> 36:37.950
If Becky's bank account
shows a deposit from Hollis...

36:37.984 --> 36:40.902
We've solved
the crime of the century.

36:44.055 --> 36:46.207
(Sighs)

36:46.241 --> 36:47.491
Huck seems confident.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.977
Good.

36:51.063 --> 36:52.513
We can just stop.

36:52.548 --> 36:57.051
Nailing Hollis for what he did
is the feds' job, not ours.

36:57.102 --> 36:59.287
Harrison...
My job, our job

36:59.321 --> 37:00.838
is to protect you.

37:00.873 --> 37:03.341
Proving this transaction,
having Hollis' head in a vise

37:03.375 --> 37:04.625
is the opposite of that.

37:04.660 --> 37:06.727
I know.

37:06.778 --> 37:10.181
This can change everything.
Do you understand that?

37:10.215 --> 37:12.099
I understand that.

37:12.134 --> 37:15.219
This guilt...
It was eating me alive.

37:15.254 --> 37:17.722
That white hat was starting
to feel like it was a lie.

37:17.756 --> 37:19.257
Hey.

37:19.291 --> 37:23.059
That white hat will
always belong on your head.

37:35.890 --> 37:38.241
(Breathes sharply)

37:38.275 --> 37:40.160
Everything is gonna be okay.

37:40.194 --> 37:41.811
And even if it's not okay,

37:41.846 --> 37:44.180
I got you, Liv.

37:47.217 --> 37:50.219
I'll hold him for as long as it takes
to get answers about that phone.

37:50.253 --> 37:51.988
(Laughing) Great.
You're making my case for me.

37:52.022 --> 37:54.956
- Your case? - Oh, I'm suing the
government for abuse of power

37:54.974 --> 37:56.792
by an out-of-control
partisan loser attorney

37:56.826 --> 37:58.360
who's trying desperately
to compensate

37:58.378 --> 37:59.795
- for the embarrassing public loss...
- Here's your coffee, sir.

37:59.829 --> 38:01.530
of a major domestic terrorism case.
Thank you.

38:01.564 --> 38:03.532
It's just a side thing.
I'm supposed to be scared

38:03.550 --> 38:05.067
when it was your client
who was in possession

38:05.101 --> 38:06.635
of a phone used exclusively

38:06.669 --> 38:08.154
to communicate with the
president's shooter?

38:08.188 --> 38:09.605
My client is a model citizen

38:09.639 --> 38:10.856
and a proud supporter
of the president.

38:10.890 --> 38:12.674
Who he put in office illegally.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.442
I love it! Love it.

38:14.476 --> 38:15.794
One minute he puts the guy in office,

38:15.828 --> 38:16.978
next he hires someone
to shoot him?

38:17.012 --> 38:18.513
(Exhales deeply)
I'd see that movie.

38:18.531 --> 38:20.081
But selling that story
to your bosses,

38:20.115 --> 38:21.850
or, God forbid, a jury...
whole other story.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.118
Too bad you'll never
get the chance.

38:23.152 --> 38:24.569
Keep my client one more
minute, and I guarantee

38:24.603 --> 38:25.887
you'll be wondering
how to make a living

38:25.921 --> 38:27.539
creating apps for mobile devices
by the end of the week.

38:27.623 --> 38:29.591
I've got everything I need.
I've got the smoking gun

38:29.625 --> 38:31.543
and the phone
that ordered it to shoot.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.378
(Laughs)

38:33.429 --> 38:35.597
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just...

38:35.631 --> 38:39.033
"Family circus"
is a hoot this week.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.068
They do so much
with so little.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.870
Don't mind me none.

38:46.608 --> 38:48.425
The American people
have spoken.

38:48.476 --> 38:49.810
Polling data on the divorce?

38:49.844 --> 38:51.111
It's a fascinating read.

38:51.146 --> 38:52.479
Rona really brought
her "A" game.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.483
Hmm.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.219
80% of women support divorce

38:59.254 --> 39:01.822
in cases when it's considered
best for the children.

39:02.156 --> 39:03.423
It surprised me, too.

39:03.458 --> 39:05.158
It was at 50%
just 20 years ago.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.794
People have a double standard
when it comes to politicians,

39:07.829 --> 39:09.046
unfortunately.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.864
So I see.
Closer to 60%.

39:10.898 --> 39:13.133
Not great,
but not insurmountable.

39:13.167 --> 39:14.985
But then Rona threw
yours and Mellie's

39:15.036 --> 39:16.536
approval ratings in the mix.

39:16.554 --> 39:18.789
Putting me at 30% approval?

39:19.940 --> 39:21.240
So it's political suicide.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.341
Oh, that's nothing.
Turn the page.

39:22.376 --> 39:25.411
Rona added Mellie's
baby bump to the mix.

39:25.445 --> 39:27.863
Wow. 10%.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.565
10%.

39:29.616 --> 39:32.301
Which translates
to pitchforks at the gates.

39:32.352 --> 39:35.371
A very colorful way of saying you
don't see a way out of this.

39:35.422 --> 39:38.157
Mellie would have to turn into
the wicked witch of the west.

39:38.191 --> 39:39.926
I mean, publically.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.277
This can't happen.

39:43.597 --> 39:46.115
Louise!

39:46.649 --> 39:49.284
Tell Tom and Hhal
I would like to go out!

39:49.419 --> 39:52.237
- And bring me my coat!
- Sir, where are you going?

39:52.271 --> 39:54.055
To see Olivia...
in broad daylight.

39:54.090 --> 39:55.473
I don't think so, sir.

39:55.508 --> 39:57.242
She's upset.
I want to see her.

39:57.276 --> 39:59.427
Louise!
Where is she?

39:59.478 --> 40:02.247
Fitz! The numbers don't lie.
This cannot happen!

40:02.281 --> 40:04.215
It's happening, so get
your head around it.

40:04.249 --> 40:05.533
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What is it?

40:05.568 --> 40:08.053
It's the First Lady, sir.
They're saying...

40:08.087 --> 40:09.387
They're saying
it's an emergency.

40:09.421 --> 40:11.189
They're saying you should hurry.

40:13.742 --> 40:15.292
(Tapping keys)
Damn.

40:15.327 --> 40:16.927
(Tapping keys)

40:16.961 --> 40:18.195
- Wait.
- What?

40:18.229 --> 40:20.514
(Tapping keys)
(Beeps)

40:20.548 --> 40:21.815
Yes!
He's in.

40:21.850 --> 40:22.983
Nice job, huck.

40:24.536 --> 40:26.303
$500,000 from
Hollis Doyle's account.

40:26.338 --> 40:27.888
That was made two years ago.

40:27.922 --> 40:29.440
One day after
the Cytron explosion,

40:29.474 --> 40:30.975
so our next big number will be...

40:31.009 --> 40:33.027
How much he paid Becky to
kill the President. (Sighs)

40:33.028 --> 40:34.845
(Taps key)
Here.

40:34.863 --> 40:37.614
(Exhales) Deposit was
made three weeks ago.

40:37.632 --> 40:39.049
The day after the
assassination attempt.

40:39.467 --> 40:41.301
$5 million to kill the president.

40:41.352 --> 40:42.736
Wow, that seems like a bargain.

40:43.170 --> 40:44.904
(Harrison)
Hollis is a cheap bastard.

40:44.939 --> 40:46.039
It wasn't Hollis.

40:46.073 --> 40:47.557
(Olivia) - What?
- It wasn't Hollis.

40:47.591 --> 40:50.010
Every account has an encrypted
customer I.D. Number.

40:50.044 --> 40:53.196
Your number. It's like a social
security number for banks,

40:53.230 --> 40:55.065
and this one
doesn't belong to Hollis.

40:55.099 --> 40:57.467
So someone else paid Becky
to kill the president?

40:57.501 --> 40:59.052
It's not Hollis.

40:59.103 --> 41:01.504
This entire investigation
was your idea.

41:01.539 --> 41:03.907
You gave me the tip.
You came to me!

41:03.941 --> 41:06.209
David, I'm sorry.
I'm genuinely sorry,

41:06.243 --> 41:07.944
but when you release Hollis,

41:07.978 --> 41:10.096
I need you to wait an
hour so that I can...

41:10.097 --> 41:12.681
It's funny. When a man is unable
to tell us anything about a crime,

41:12.699 --> 41:14.734
especially one he never
committed, releasing him

41:14.768 --> 41:16.335
is in fact the polite thing to do!

41:16.370 --> 41:17.687
We let him go an hour ago.

41:17.721 --> 41:19.972
(Beep)
(Exhales) Huck!

41:21.224 --> 41:22.575
They let him go.

41:22.609 --> 41:25.144
Hollis Doyle is out.

41:26.997 --> 41:28.414
(Mellie screaming)

41:28.465 --> 41:30.182
What's going on?
She's in labor, sir.

41:30.217 --> 41:33.002
Ma'am, don't push yet, okay?
(Screaming continues)

41:33.036 --> 41:34.670
(Breathing rhythmically) All right.
All right, there you go.

41:34.705 --> 41:37.289
I forgot how much it hurts!

41:37.341 --> 41:39.725
(Gasping)

41:39.776 --> 41:41.177
It hurts!

41:41.211 --> 41:44.213
(Screaming)

41:44.231 --> 41:46.032
It's gonna be fine.

41:46.066 --> 41:48.000
(Screaming continues)
Honey, it's gonna be fine.

41:48.051 --> 41:50.636
(Crying) We're old pros
at this, remember?

41:50.671 --> 41:53.856
We're old pros. Okay?
We got this, all right? (Screaming)

41:53.890 --> 41:56.308
All right. When she says
"push," we go on three, right?

41:56.360 --> 41:57.710
(Screaming and crying)

41:59.344 --> 42:01.796
And you get to scream
as loud as you want.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.698
- Why?
- Because it is my right!

42:03.732 --> 42:06.267
Because it is your right!
Now, you can do this. (Screaming)

42:06.301 --> 42:07.618
Say it.

42:07.669 --> 42:08.936
I can do this!

42:08.971 --> 42:11.722
- Yes, you can.
- Okay. All right, ma'am. Ma'am?

42:11.757 --> 42:13.708
I want you to push, all right?
Right now.

42:13.742 --> 42:15.059
All right, ready, champ?
Okay? All right.

42:15.093 --> 42:16.460
Here we go, champ.
All right, one,

42:16.495 --> 42:18.029
two... three!

42:18.063 --> 42:20.815
(Screams loudly)
(Speaks indistinctly)

42:39.718 --> 42:41.385
Which floor?

42:41.420 --> 42:42.837
Same as you.

42:46.224 --> 42:47.758
(Projector and camera shutter click)
