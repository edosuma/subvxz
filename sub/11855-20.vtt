WEBVTT

00:50.792 --> 00:52.041
Monty. Butch.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.709
Hey, Joe.

00:53.792 --> 00:54.667
Coffee?

00:54.750 --> 00:55.917
Uh, hot chocolate.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.291
Come on, Ham,
you big-boned bastard

00:58.375 --> 00:59.875
I'm freezing my ass off here.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.333
Stick it, Butchie.

01:03.542 --> 01:08.333
Hey, can I get, uh,
two coffees and, uh, a cocoa?

01:08.417 --> 01:10.041
- Alright, put your money
away.
- I got it.

01:10.125 --> 01:13.542
No, no this one's on me
on account of Joe's promotion.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.041
(Butch)
'Yeah?'

01:15.125 --> 01:16.458
You're the new
straw boss?

01:16.542 --> 01:18.083
I don't know yet.
We'll see.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.166
(Butch)
'Hey, wait a minute.'

01:19.250 --> 01:20.709
I thought you wanted that job.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.417
I withdrew my application.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.291
Oh, Johnstone
hasn't made up his mind yet

01:24.375 --> 01:25.875
maybe I'm gonna throw my hat in.

01:25.959 --> 01:28.125
He's gonna hire you
over Joe? Sure.

01:28.208 --> 01:31.333
Yeah, so that's why it is
that you wussy'd out?

01:31.417 --> 01:32.500
Hey, I'll pay.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.583
Hey, take it easy, straw boss.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.750
Now your money's
better than mine?

01:36.834 --> 01:38.667
I'm just tryin'
to get my motor running.

01:38.750 --> 01:39.959
'It's Mary's birthday.'

01:40.041 --> 01:41.792
I don't call up the full-tilt
and boogie tonight

01:41.875 --> 01:43.166
I'll be sleeping
on the couch.

01:45.959 --> 01:47.166
(Butch)
'Hey, hey, check it out.'

01:47.250 --> 01:49.542
Boss man. 12 o'clock.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.709
What's he doing here today?

01:53.250 --> 01:54.834
Hey, maybe
the rumors are true.

01:54.917 --> 01:57.333
All the other textile mills
seem to be closing down.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.166
Shift change, ten minutes.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.500
Punch in.

02:01.625 --> 02:02.834
Don't worry.
We're gonna be A-okay.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.750
Hope this is worth
the two-hour trip.

02:51.834 --> 02:53.291
I checked
the
H-records.

02:53.375 --> 02:54.750
There was
a Joe Young

02:54.834 --> 02:57.000
killed in 1985.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.291
This James Hogan

02:58.375 --> 02:59.959
he's the dead guy's nephew?

03:00.041 --> 03:01.750
Heard something
about the case.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.667
You two are still
pretty close, huh?

03:03.750 --> 03:07.166
Oh, close? I put him away for
his grandma's murder last
year.

03:07.250 --> 03:11.417
Yeah, but, uh,
you got a soft spot for him.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.083
Why do you
say that?

03:13.166 --> 03:15.250
The desk drawer full of
love letters he's written you.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.458
They're not
love
letters.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.625
Just saying, maybe
Jimbo roped you out here

03:19.709 --> 03:21.750
to have himself a smile.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.250
How you makin' out, James?

03:36.333 --> 03:39.000
Didn't know
you'd be bringing someone.

03:39.959 --> 03:43.166
Uh, my partner, Scotty Valens.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.125
I could step out
if you want to be alone.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.500
Let's just get down to it.

03:49.959 --> 03:51.667
James?

03:51.750 --> 03:54.583
Uh, well, it's something
I heard during counseling.

03:54.667 --> 03:59.542
Guys, uh, admitting to the group
the lowest thing they ever done.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.500
And, uh, this older fella,
Ham Dunn, starts in

04:02.583 --> 04:04.250
and says he's from
the old neighborhood.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.417
Oh, Kensington.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.458
Back in '85,
he says he came across

04:07.542 --> 04:09.291
a dead body
at a local filling station.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.709
Which you realized
was your uncle, Joe
Young.

04:11.792 --> 04:14.000
(James)
'Goes on to say instead
of reporting the murder'

04:14.083 --> 04:15.917
to the police,
he cleaned Joe out

04:16.000 --> 04:17.959
snaked away with 20 bucks.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.166
Well, that's low, alright.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.667
Back then, cops thought
he was murdered

04:20.750 --> 04:22.000
in a petty stick-up.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.709
But you're here and he was
already dead

04:23.792 --> 04:26.000
when Ham came by
and took the dough.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.083
So the motive was
something
other than robbery.

04:29.166 --> 04:32.083
We should see about grabbing
Ham
out of his cell, have a chat.

04:32.166 --> 04:34.166
He's not here.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.667
He got released...last week.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.834
I'll find out
where he went.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.208
So..

04:55.959 --> 04:57.542
...how you getting along?

04:57.625 --> 04:59.583
Okay, I guess.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.500
Have you been getting
my letters?

05:05.583 --> 05:07.709
Yes, uh, thank you.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.083
They didn't come off creepy,
did they?

05:11.166 --> 05:12.083
No, no.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.542
They were...nice, James.

05:16.709 --> 05:17.959
Sweet.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.291
Then why didn't you
ever write back?

06:05.291 --> 06:08.083
ME report says Joe
was stabbed once in the chest

06:08.166 --> 06:10.417
by a serrated
double-edge blade.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.208
It's pretty
specific
knife.

06:12.291 --> 06:14.041
Any suspects
the first time around?

06:14.125 --> 06:17.458
Well, none. Job reads pretty
much like James said.

06:17.542 --> 06:20.458
They thought Joe got aced
for whatever was in his
wallet.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.333
Well, Kensington then was
the industrial heart

06:22.417 --> 06:24.000
of the city till the mid '80s.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.667
Then the textile mills
closed down.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.542
Yeah, downward slide after that.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.792
Gas attendant
on duty called it in?

06:30.875 --> 06:33.166
No. It was more like off duty.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.709
Says here
the guy was sawing logs

06:34.792 --> 06:36.625
behind the register
when the murder happened.

06:36.709 --> 06:38.041
(John)
'He signed this down here'

06:38.125 --> 06:40.792
"He wasn't a whole hell
of a lot of help."

06:40.875 --> 06:43.291
Job went cold fast.

06:43.375 --> 06:44.792
You locate this guy
James told you
about?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.709
What was it, uh
Ham Dunn?

06:46.792 --> 06:48.959
Yeah, he's in a halfway house
in Yeadon.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.542
What about next of kin?

06:50.625 --> 06:53.458
Well, Joe's wife,
Mary,
lives in Bristol.

06:54.792 --> 06:55.959
Well, let's spread out

06:56.041 --> 06:58.250
let 'em know
Joe's case just warmed up.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.458
Living a life of leisure

07:15.542 --> 07:17.250
since being released, Ham.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.333
Not supposed to be proving

07:18.417 --> 07:19.458
you can hold down a job?

07:19.542 --> 07:21.041
I don't
start
till next
week.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.792
Besides, I'm
owed
some good times

07:22.875 --> 07:24.333
after what was
taken from me.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.333
What was taken from you?

07:27.417 --> 07:29.709
You ripped off an ATM
from the minimart

07:29.792 --> 07:32.125
then buried the
machine
in your backyard.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.417
That wasn't my fault.
I had no choice.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.875
It was Kensington, not me.

07:36.959 --> 07:39.834
Talk about that last night
at the gas station, Ham.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.542
I pulled in to fill up, saw Joe

07:43.625 --> 07:45.083
saw he was dead

07:45.166 --> 07:46.875
so I stole the $20.

07:47.959 --> 07:49.667
- That's it?
- 'Yeah.'

07:49.750 --> 07:51.875
- Didn't see anyone?
- No.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.709
I mean, hell, all the street
lamps were broken out.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.709
'Been nine months
since the mill closed'

07:56.792 --> 07:59.083
and whole damn area
was falling apart.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.291
So you ripping off a dead guy

08:00.375 --> 08:01.834
you gonna blame
that on Kensington, too?

08:01.917 --> 08:04.834
Doing that was harder
than you'll ever know.

08:04.917 --> 08:05.875
I worked with Joe

08:05.959 --> 08:08.750
every day for ten years.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.667
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I got you.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.000
Okay.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.417
That can't be good.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.041
There's some mumble-grumble
going on around here

08:52.125 --> 08:54.875
that I need to
put an end to.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.750
'You all know
how the non-union factories'

08:56.834 --> 09:00.917
in the South are running
our mills out of business.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.834
I heard you're gonna retire
some old-timers.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.834
You're gonna lay
some of us off, too.

09:05.917 --> 09:08.083
Not retiring anybody, Butch.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.083
But, with the peanut
wage
they're paying in the
South

09:11.166 --> 09:12.792
we're being
undersold
and out-produced.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.834
That mean you're gonna
cut back our hours?

09:14.917 --> 09:16.166
I'm not saying that, either.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.792
(Joe)
'Hey, Mr. Johnstone'

09:17.875 --> 09:20.291
I know one thing
they're not doing down South

09:20.375 --> 09:22.375
is making better carpets
than we are.

09:22.458 --> 09:23.625
(in unison)
Yeah.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.667
That's true, Joe.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.291
So this mill's not closing down?

09:31.375 --> 09:32.458
Look, I know you all

09:33.750 --> 09:36.458
sweepers, bobbin-pullers,
weavers, yarn men.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.583
'None of you are
going anywhere'

09:39.667 --> 09:41.709
because I'm not going anywhere.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.333
I'm staying right here
in Kensington.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.583
'And that's a promise.'

09:52.083 --> 09:54.208
(Ham)
'I ain't buyin' it, guys.'

09:54.291 --> 09:56.917
You heard the man.
He gave his word.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.500
I'm telling you, Joe

09:58.583 --> 10:02.000
get out in front of this
before there are no jobs.

10:06.750 --> 10:10.125
Well, I had a gut feeling
the place was going down.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.709
And a month later, it did.

10:12.792 --> 10:15.000
Lucky I could carve
a side of beef.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.417
Got a job at the grocery.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.625
But those three
were out of luck.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.875
(Scotty)
'So, forget the dead part.'

10:20.959 --> 10:22.500
The guy with the job
is taking money

10:22.583 --> 10:24.166
off the guy without one.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.250
'How's that work?'

10:25.333 --> 10:26.709
I wasn't supposed to

10:26.792 --> 10:29.625
but I was extending credit
to almost everyone.

10:29.709 --> 10:32.583
So, in the end,
I was broke too.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.709
When I was pregnant,
I couldn't sleep at night

10:42.792 --> 10:46.208
so Joe would drive us out
to look at the stars.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.917
(Nick)
Sounds like
nice times.

10:49.375 --> 10:50.959
So, where is your son?

10:51.041 --> 10:53.542
In Iowa. At school.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.291
He wants to be a writer.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.208
(Will)
'Mary, thinking back,
did you know anyone'

10:58.291 --> 10:59.542
who wanted to hurt Joe?

10:59.625 --> 11:00.709
Everyone loved Joe.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.583
Wanted to be around him,
not hurt him.

11:02.667 --> 11:05.333
You did hit some pretty
hard times though, right?

11:05.417 --> 11:07.208
Oh, for sure.
We couldn't pay our bills.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.375
Lived off of macaroni
and baloney.

11:09.458 --> 11:10.875
(Will)
'And what about Joe?'

11:10.959 --> 11:14.458
When that mill closed,
you see any change in him?

11:14.542 --> 11:18.041
Yeah, but not the one
you'd think.

11:18.125 --> 11:21.041
I drove out as soon
as I heard the news.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.083
Found Joe in a good mood.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.750
Joe, I just heard.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.542
It's okay, it's okay.
Monty's come to the rescue.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.250
Yeah, Monty's got
this cab company
idea.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.250
Now, he's been yapping
about it for years.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.041
(Joe)
'Idea's a winner, hon.'

11:38.125 --> 11:39.375
Monty says the word
we're all set

11:39.458 --> 11:40.917
to go into business together.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.375
All three of you?

11:42.458 --> 11:45.625
Monty's got the ideas
and I got a car we can
use.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.250
If everything's so rosy,
why are you looking

11:47.333 --> 11:49.000
so spooked, Monty?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.792
A lot has to go right

11:50.875 --> 11:51.959
starting with the hack up fee

11:52.041 --> 11:54.542
for converting Butch's car
into a taxi.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.250
We're gonna need
a down payment by tomorrow.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.750
How much?

12:02.834 --> 12:04.125
1,100.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.250
I told him
that you and me

12:05.333 --> 12:06.709
got $1,200 in savings

12:06.792 --> 12:09.000
that we've been
wanting
to invest.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.208
What to you think?

12:11.583 --> 12:12.709
Do you really think
this can work?

12:12.792 --> 12:14.125
(Butch)
'It better work.'

12:14.208 --> 12:17.458
Monty's Plan B is
to go rip off Johnstone's
house.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.458
(Joe)
'Hon, Monty's
done his homework.'

12:19.542 --> 12:20.917
He's just afraid
to pull the
trigger.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.041
Yeah, like always.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.750
Well, you have Joe's vote,
you have mine.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.875
Monty, you decide you want to
shake on this...I'm willing.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.166
But in the end
that taxi business

12:56.250 --> 12:58.041
never got off the ground.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.083
How come?

12:59.166 --> 13:00.959
Joe told me it was his fault.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.583
Said he messed up
on the payments

13:02.667 --> 13:04.959
something about not reading
the fine print.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.917
That must have been a big blow.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.834
How did Monty and Butch take it?

13:08.917 --> 13:10.166
Bad.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.834
I think they really hated
him
for screwing up.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.375
Why do you say that?

13:14.458 --> 13:17.041
The summer my Joe died
everyone we knew

13:17.125 --> 13:19.959
walked the streets of
Kensington
behind his casket.

13:21.291 --> 13:25.333
Everyone, that is,
except his two best friends.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.875
(male #1)
'Lilly Rush?'

13:43.959 --> 13:45.291
Who are you?

13:45.375 --> 13:47.792
Mark Phillips. NYPD.

13:47.875 --> 13:48.875
I'm going
to have to come in.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.875
Uh, I don't think so.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.208
It's about
your sister Christina.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.667
- What about her?
- I'm looking for her.

13:57.750 --> 13:58.917
Why?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.083
Because I'm looking for her.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.208
You mind if I come in now?

14:06.458 --> 14:09.000
I understand I'm making you
a little nervous

14:09.083 --> 14:10.333
but it'll behoove you

14:10.417 --> 14:12.125
and your sister
if you cooperate.

14:12.208 --> 14:13.792
Behoove us, huh?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.583
(Mark)
See.

14:17.667 --> 14:20.667
This little gal knows
there's nothing to be afraid
of.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.458
Look, I can't help you.

14:29.583 --> 14:32.333
You got a permit for that?

14:32.417 --> 14:34.083
Yeah, same one you got.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.417
I work Homicide, Philly PD.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.500
You could have offered that up.

14:42.583 --> 14:43.709
You could have asked.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.709
So, Detective..

14:47.792 --> 14:49.166
...are you going to tell me
where your sister is, or
what?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.166
You going to tell me
what this is about?

14:51.250 --> 14:52.875
No can do.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.583
Me neither.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.291
I know you must have sworn

15:01.375 --> 15:02.625
an oath
to uphold the law.

15:02.709 --> 15:03.792
Same as you.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.750
Right.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.500
But sometimes,
with family..

15:09.583 --> 15:11.625
I know what I got to do.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.667
Those climbing spikes
are pretty bad-ass.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.834
More like a pain in my ass.

15:24.417 --> 15:25.667
I'm not cut out for this.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.417
Not to mention too old.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.792
So, Monty

15:29.875 --> 15:31.417
I'm looking back
at Joe's murder.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.917
It wasn't robbery?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.667
We got a new angle from, uh,
James Hogan, Joe's nephew.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.750
Oh, yeah, I remember that kid
from Joe's wedding.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.500
Back when you were
on better terms?

15:40.583 --> 15:41.750
What do you mean?

15:41.834 --> 15:43.333
'You and Joe,
at the wedding.'

15:43.417 --> 15:45.959
Word is you were a no-show
for his funeral.

15:46.041 --> 15:48.166
Yeah...right.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.667
- You want to tell me why?
- Not particularly.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.375
Joe's wife thinks
it was over a taxi service
idea

15:54.458 --> 15:56.083
that didn't fly.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.291
'That have anything
to do with it?'

15:59.417 --> 16:01.041
Yeah.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.333
Everything.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.625
Hey, Joe, here you go,
last check.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.875
That means me, too.

16:10.959 --> 16:11.875
Any jobs come in?

16:11.959 --> 16:13.125
And don't start talking to me

16:13.208 --> 16:16.083
'about any of that
training stuff either.'

16:16.166 --> 16:17.917
There is
one new listing.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.917
What's it for?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.834
(woman #1)
'A constable.'

16:22.542 --> 16:23.500
What the hell's that?

16:23.583 --> 16:26.000
Serving eviction notices.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.208
Oh. Thank you.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.208
You see me doing
that take a ball peen hammer

16:30.291 --> 16:32.750
to the back of my head.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.333
'Where have
you been, huh?'

16:34.417 --> 16:36.709
'We got a boatload
of stuff to do.'

16:36.792 --> 16:38.542
I was telling Butch,
everything goes right

16:38.625 --> 16:40.750
we can be running
fares
by top of next week.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.959
What?

16:46.041 --> 16:48.291
I got bad news..

16:48.375 --> 16:50.667
...and-and good, I guess.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.333
Spill it.

16:52.417 --> 16:53.583
My Uncle Samuel
said he would

16:53.667 --> 16:55.083
make room for me
at his shoe repair shop.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.250
No way.
No way.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.583
You're not chickening out.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.625
I already started,
this morning.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.792
Monty, everything's
riding on this.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.041
It's bone dry out there.

17:08.041 --> 17:11.083
- Guys, I got a family to
feed.
all

17:11.166 --> 17:13.417
Joe's going to lose
his $1,200.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.917
Mary's having the baby
next month.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.750
I got to have cash.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.417
Scurry your chicken ass
out of here.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.125
I-I would.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.000
I need my check.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.750
I'm going to come back.

17:38.834 --> 17:40.667
I'm going
to burn this place down!

17:45.208 --> 17:48.875
(Monty)
'Butch was the one
who did all the yellin''

17:48.959 --> 17:50.667
but Joe's silence..

17:51.750 --> 17:53.500
that's what said the most.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.458
It was the end
of your
friendship.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.458
(Monty)
'Yeah, when he died'

17:57.542 --> 18:00.333
I knew he wouldn't
have wanted me at his funeral.

18:00.417 --> 18:02.166
I had to respect that.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.750
Well, what
about
you and Butch?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.583
Can't say that, uh

18:06.667 --> 18:08.417
he was all that forgiving,
either.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.208
Okay, Monty, that's all for now.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.583
Guess I'm going up now.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.834
Butch is here, the other
missing friend at Joe's
funeral.

18:21.917 --> 18:24.792
Rush, your
boyfriend.
Again.

18:24.875 --> 18:28.542
Why don't you go tie that up?
Nick and I can talk to Butch.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.000
Hello?

18:39.083 --> 18:40.792
(James)
'It's me.'

18:40.875 --> 18:43.333
James, there's boundaries
I have to keep.

18:43.417 --> 18:44.625
That goes for the letters

18:44.709 --> 18:46.417
and the phone.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.500
I just.. I forgot to ask you
something when you were here.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.417
Okay.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.417
Who hurt you?

18:55.625 --> 18:57.542
What?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.375
You seem different
than a year ago.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.542
(Lilly)
'Um'

19:00.625 --> 19:02.959
- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.750
Look, James, we can't do this.

19:06.834 --> 19:10.709
So, did you find anything out
about my uncle's murder?

19:10.792 --> 19:14.375
Uh, we're just now
tracking down his pals.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.959
Monty?

19:16.041 --> 19:17.959
Yeah, you know him?

19:18.041 --> 19:20.375
(James)
'Yeah, when I was 14,
Joe and Monty'

19:20.458 --> 19:21.542
showed me around the mill.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.417
I thought
it was neat but..

19:23.500 --> 19:25.083
Monty said
not to be like him.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.417
He said he was born in the mill
he was going to die in the mill.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.333
Said I'd be happier
if I kept my nose into books.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.166
Probably should have took
his advice.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.959
Uh, alright, James,
I have to run, so--

19:38.041 --> 19:42.208
(James)
'Last year, at the train
stop..'

19:44.375 --> 19:46.250
...you said you were my girl.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.458
I know.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.750
Was that just a trick?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.041
(Lilly)
'No.'

19:56.125 --> 19:57.750
So, what'd you mean by that?

19:59.333 --> 20:01.417
That we were friends, James.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.959
'But that's all.'

20:08.917 --> 20:12.458
Your heart's good,
you know that?

20:14.291 --> 20:17.291
I-I-if it's not
going to be me..

20:17.375 --> 20:21.000
...I hope you find someone
you can talk to.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.667
That's the one.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.458
(Nick)
'Sharp-looking shirt,
Butch.'

20:38.542 --> 20:41.166
Thanks. Always loved
Italian fabrics.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.041
Just could never afford them.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.375
So, Butch, we hear Monty

20:45.458 --> 20:47.375
blew your cabbie deal.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.792
He sure did.

20:49.875 --> 20:53.542
Which put him on the
outs
with you and Joe.

20:54.542 --> 20:55.583
True.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.458
(Nick)
'Monty says out
of respect'

20:57.542 --> 20:59.834
that's why he chose
not to go to Joe's funeral.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.000
I can see that.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.083
So, what about you?

21:05.959 --> 21:07.792
Be the opposite for me.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.125
Meaning you lost
respect for Joe?

21:10.208 --> 21:12.583
He turned out to be
a bigger fink than Monty

21:12.667 --> 21:13.834
'what he did
to my sister.'

21:15.917 --> 21:18.417
(Butch)
'Janie! Hey!'

21:19.917 --> 21:21.583
What the hell's
going on?

21:24.208 --> 21:25.458
Janie!

21:28.917 --> 21:30.792
Janie, what's going on?

21:30.875 --> 21:33.583
We fell behind on rent.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.709
Joe, what are you doing here?

21:34.792 --> 21:37.875
He's the one who's evicting us.

21:37.959 --> 21:40.166
(Butch)
'What?'

21:40.250 --> 21:42.000
I know I'm scum.
I'm sorry.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.542
You're sorry?

21:44.625 --> 21:45.709
I'd to take that job.

21:45.792 --> 21:48.458
Tell me you're putting
a joke on me, Joe.

21:48.542 --> 21:52.208
Butch, my wife can't buy
bread,
soap, noodles.

21:52.291 --> 21:54.875
Neither can my wife,
but I'm out there

21:54.959 --> 21:57.542
and I am pounding the pavement

21:57.625 --> 22:00.417
looking for
something decent to do.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.750
The baby's doctor bills..

22:19.125 --> 22:20.709
Get your ass out of here, Joe!

22:20.792 --> 22:21.667
Tom. Tom.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.417
(Butch)
'Whoa, Tom!'

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
(Janie)
'Baby, no, please.'

22:27.250 --> 22:29.333
- Where's my Winchester?
- In the pantry.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.083
So, Joe was ousting
your sister and her husband.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.500
You can see why I wasn't
that interested

22:40.583 --> 22:42.917
in going to his funeral.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.709
So, did your
brother-in-law get
evicted?

22:45.792 --> 22:47.709
Out on the street that night.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.417
Man's home is his castle,
take it from him

22:53.500 --> 22:55.583
you got a pissed-off king.

23:02.542 --> 23:04.959
(Tom)
'35 years, I never
had a problem.'

23:05.041 --> 23:06.792
And then the mills closed.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.583
Then I went in the dumper
like everyone else.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.333
But not everyone else

23:11.417 --> 23:13.083
threatened Joe
with a Winchester.

23:13.166 --> 23:18.083
That, plus the two months
you did at Overbrook Hospital.

23:18.166 --> 23:20.959
Makes us worry
you did something rash.

23:21.041 --> 23:22.250
I didn't.

23:22.333 --> 23:23.417
Swear it.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.166
But you were
having moods.

23:27.417 --> 23:29.959
One day I'd want to shoot you

23:30.041 --> 23:31.458
the next I was sobbing in my car

23:31.542 --> 23:34.792
listening to David Lee
Roth
sing California Girls.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.750
They give you
something for that?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.667
Yeah.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.875
Take the meds regular.

23:41.959 --> 23:44.041
Keeps me even keel.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.709
So, you ever
see Joe again

23:46.792 --> 23:48.125
after the eviction?

23:48.208 --> 23:50.417
Sure. Every Wednesday.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.667
What was Wednesdays?

23:51.750 --> 23:53.166
We had a regular poker game.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.500
You want to kill Joe
but you play cards with him?

23:55.583 --> 23:59.000
Everyone there had a reason
to hate someone else.

23:59.083 --> 24:01.792
'Me, Ham, all the guys.'

24:01.875 --> 24:04.125
But that was our life.

24:04.208 --> 24:07.000
We were the only people we knew.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.375
All that bad blood
in one room..

24:10.709 --> 24:12.667
...it ever get ugly?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.458
Game took on a whole new tone.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.917
Heard your shoe job
was a bust, Monty.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.166
Store closed, I'm on the
street,
same as you guys.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.291
(Butch)
'Yeah, but not Joe.'

24:25.375 --> 24:26.667
He's a constable.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.417
You know I quit
that racket.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.542
You in or out?

24:30.625 --> 24:31.625
I fold.

24:31.709 --> 24:33.083
Yeah, of course
you do.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.792
Me and you, Ham.

24:39.166 --> 24:41.250
Alright,
I see your $2.

24:43.458 --> 24:44.875
And, uh..

24:46.208 --> 24:47.709
...I raise $100.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.208
Hey, this is
dime-ante game.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.083
And don't go flashing
your money around.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.625
(Ham)
'I ain't flashing.'

24:53.709 --> 24:55.375
I got troubles, too.

24:55.458 --> 24:58.041
And we never made
a rule about limits.

24:58.125 --> 25:00.583
I got 30 bucks upstairs
on my dresser.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.625
$30 ain't $100.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.000
(Joe)
'How much you guys got?'

25:05.083 --> 25:07.125
(Ham)
You want to get
bankrolled?

25:07.208 --> 25:08.208
Go ahead.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.917
We win, we split it three ways.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.083
Hey, I got, uh, $30. Plus
Joe's,
we need $40 more.

25:13.166 --> 25:15.625
We're supposed to
last
till next Friday.

25:15.709 --> 25:17.083
Not that it ever does.

25:17.166 --> 25:18.417
You owe a lot of credit
at the store.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.750
Yeah, I know I do.

25:19.834 --> 25:21.458
Alright?
Stop talking about it!

25:23.041 --> 25:24.667
What do you say, Butch?

25:25.834 --> 25:27.792
Alright, fine, $40.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.333
Plus upstairs
makes a 100.

25:32.417 --> 25:34.000
Call.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.583
Flush.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.041
'Jack high.'

25:42.834 --> 25:43.875
Hmm. Full boat.

25:45.041 --> 25:46.333
'Sevens and threes.'

25:46.417 --> 25:48.125
[laughter]
Oh!

25:48.208 --> 25:49.417
Yeah!

25:49.500 --> 25:51.458
No. No, no!
No way!

25:51.542 --> 25:53.834
Get your hands off
the money, Ham!

25:53.917 --> 25:54.917
You cheated!

25:55.000 --> 25:56.208
It's a conspiracy.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.583
Conspiracy?

25:57.667 --> 26:00.875
Yeah, 'cause I'm
the only one that's got a
job.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.667
I want my money back.

26:06.917 --> 26:07.959
No!

26:10.208 --> 26:11.709
You're a goner, Joe.

26:11.792 --> 26:13.208
'Mark that.'

26:17.875 --> 26:19.166
Following weekend..

26:20.750 --> 26:22.667
...Joe was dead.

26:22.750 --> 26:25.166
You think that was
a real threat from Ham?

26:26.250 --> 26:28.834
It was desperate times.

26:28.917 --> 26:30.875
None of us were ourselves.

26:36.458 --> 26:39.542
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.125
So what was so urgent?

26:41.208 --> 26:43.375
There's a New York
Detective Phillips

26:43.458 --> 26:44.959
looking for you.

26:45.041 --> 26:46.083
Why?

26:47.250 --> 26:48.750
You tell me.

26:48.834 --> 26:50.250
I don't know.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.959
[sighs]
Chris, I made some calls

26:53.041 --> 26:54.917
I'm hearing
credit card fraud.

26:57.125 --> 26:58.375
It wasn't me.

26:58.458 --> 26:59.834
No?

26:59.917 --> 27:01.291
It was my boss

27:01.375 --> 27:03.208
at the flower shop
where I worked in SoHo.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.166
The owner, Greg had a scam.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.125
So is Greg the dangerous
New York guy?

27:09.208 --> 27:10.792
Actually, I don't
want to know.

27:10.875 --> 27:13.458
I'm just passing
on information.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.333
So what did
you tell
him?

27:17.417 --> 27:18.792
This detective.

27:18.875 --> 27:20.041
Nothing.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.917
Lil.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.208
What should I do?

27:24.291 --> 27:25.458
Whatever you want.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.125
I just don't want any more
early morning visits

27:27.208 --> 27:29.458
from the NYPD, okay?

27:35.959 --> 27:38.792
Ham, you pushed Joe
into making that bet

27:38.875 --> 27:41.333
then whined about wanting
your money back when you lost.

27:41.417 --> 27:43.709
I don't feel
bad about
that.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.291
He owed me money.

27:45.375 --> 27:46.792
They all did.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.291
I told you that. He owed.

27:49.375 --> 27:51.250
Which still bugs you
to this day.

27:51.333 --> 27:52.542
[sighs]
So?

27:52.625 --> 27:53.917
So?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.834
That brings us to you
having motive to kill Joe.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.000
I-I-I..

27:58.083 --> 28:00.291
You know, maybe I should
just muzzle myself.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.041
Yeah, do that, but you're
coming with us.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.458
Oh, have a heart

28:03.542 --> 28:05.250
I'm just breathing
the air again.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.917
You better give us
a reason to believe

28:07.000 --> 28:09.250
you didn't hunt Joe down.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.917
I can give you a reason..

28:12.000 --> 28:13.417
I just don't wanna.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.834
Why not?

28:16.333 --> 28:19.709
Because it's embarrassing.

28:27.959 --> 28:29.792
- Patty.
- I want our money back.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.041
What money?

28:31.125 --> 28:32.959
From poker.
Joe cheated.

28:33.041 --> 28:34.625
Joe would never cheat.

28:34.709 --> 28:36.667
Oh, that's
right,
Joe the Saint.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.000
he'd never do
anything
wrong.

28:39.083 --> 28:40.208
Pat, let's just go.

28:40.291 --> 28:43.166
You want our gas
shut off
tomorrow?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.959
You better get Joe
'cause we're not
leaving.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.458
(Joe)
What the hell's going on, Ham?

28:52.208 --> 28:53.792
We need that hundred back.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.667
- A hundred?
- Yes.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.041
No. No, that's ours now.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.375
My baby needs
his shots this week.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.125
Jenny's plugging
the holes in her
Keds

29:00.208 --> 29:02.792
with cardboard, and
Michael
needs his workbooks.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.166
You better tell your
wife here and now

29:04.250 --> 29:06.583
I didn't cheat anybody, Ham.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.041
Did he or didn't he?

29:14.875 --> 29:16.417
Ham, answer me.

29:19.583 --> 29:20.959
Oh, crap.

29:22.625 --> 29:24.000
Crap.

29:25.208 --> 29:26.583
You should've
quit the mill

29:26.667 --> 29:29.083
when Ham told you
about the
contracts.

29:29.166 --> 29:30.834
Told me what?

29:30.917 --> 29:33.000
Well, not in
so many words, but..

29:33.083 --> 29:35.583
Look, Joe, I knew
Johnstone was selling.

29:35.667 --> 29:38.083
In his office,
I saw the paperwork.

29:38.166 --> 29:40.083
When?

29:40.166 --> 29:42.208
The day before he made
his big speech.

29:42.291 --> 29:44.500
You saying Johnstone
lied that day?

29:44.583 --> 29:45.750
'To all of us guys?'

29:46.792 --> 29:49.542
Without so much as a flinch.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.709
I think it's time for Plan B.

29:59.709 --> 30:01.959
He looked like someone
had hit him in the gut.

30:02.041 --> 30:04.041
Because Johnstone
had betrayed him?

30:04.125 --> 30:06.875
[chuckles]
You know, if Joe
had one fault

30:06.959 --> 30:10.208
it's that he trusted people
when they gave their word.

30:10.291 --> 30:13.667
Never crossed his mind
the boss man would lie.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.834
You know what Plan B was?

30:17.917 --> 30:19.375
Nah.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.333
I do.

30:28.458 --> 30:29.750
I got nothing to hide.

30:31.166 --> 30:33.333
Then let's talk
about Plan B.

30:34.542 --> 30:35.917
I don't know what that is.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.417
(Will)
'Butch, we know
about the robbery.'

30:38.500 --> 30:40.083
That you, Monty, and Joe
were planning

30:40.166 --> 30:42.333
to stick it to Johnstone.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.875
So maybe we talked about a plan.

30:46.959 --> 30:48.000
Guys can talk.

30:48.083 --> 30:50.291
We also checked
police logs from '85.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.125
Joe's truck was seen
in the area.

30:52.208 --> 30:54.041
Neighbor of Johnstone's
called it in.

30:54.125 --> 30:55.917
Two guys in the cab
with him.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.166
Got a feeling
one of 'em was you.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.417
We get why
you're
lying.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.750
Admitting you
did the
robbery

31:01.834 --> 31:03.500
would put you with Joe
the night of the murder.

31:03.583 --> 31:05.250
(Will)
'But if that's all you did'

31:05.333 --> 31:07.417
'a robbery 20 years ago'

31:07.500 --> 31:09.750
you don't have much
to worry about.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.000
- No?
- 'No.'

31:12.041 --> 31:14.375
But you got to talk, Butch.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.417
May-maybe we trespassed.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.125
Trespassed?

31:21.208 --> 31:23.041
Nothing more.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.000
519 College.

31:27.083 --> 31:28.125
This is it.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.208
I know there's a hi-fi

31:29.291 --> 31:31.667
Pioneer turntable,
receiver, speakers

31:31.750 --> 31:33.041
that's got to be
worth a grand.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.875
That's two mortgage
payments right
there.

31:34.959 --> 31:38.333
I'll hit the bedroom, get
whatever jewelry they got.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.250
You said there
was
a China Cabinet?

31:42.333 --> 31:44.375
It's the first room
on the left.

31:45.667 --> 31:48.333
Mary has never had
a nice set of dishes.

31:49.709 --> 31:51.125
- Oh, man.
- What?

31:51.208 --> 31:53.166
- I don't know about this.
- Hey.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.542
Don't start pulling
that crap, chickenman.

31:55.625 --> 31:57.625
[clanking]
It's unlocked.

32:00.959 --> 32:03.375
Okay, let's spread out.

32:07.917 --> 32:09.667
- Oh, no.
- What?

32:12.875 --> 32:14.500
(Joe)
'He's gone.'

32:15.834 --> 32:17.125
Son of a bitch!

32:17.208 --> 32:18.709
Shh! Keep it down.

32:18.792 --> 32:20.083
Why?

32:20.166 --> 32:21.417
What's it matter now?

32:21.500 --> 32:22.959
(Joe)
'He's right, Monty.'

32:23.041 --> 32:26.000
Who the hell cares?
There's not a thing here.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.166
Which makes me the biggest
turkey in town

32:28.250 --> 32:30.750
because I believed
everything he said!

32:31.500 --> 32:32.917
Damn it!

32:35.375 --> 32:37.917
Hey, that's got
to be worth something.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.375
(Monty)
How do we get it down?

32:43.458 --> 32:44.875
We'll pull it.

32:44.959 --> 32:46.125
Alright,
boost me up.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.041
[grunting]
Not yet.

32:51.125 --> 32:53.333
I can't reach it.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.291
He promised he'd
stay in
Kensington.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.750
He promised to keep
the mill open.

33:12.834 --> 33:15.166
Trying to steal a light fixture.

33:17.291 --> 33:19.041
How pitiful.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.792
Monty and me went off drinking.

33:27.208 --> 33:29.208
That's the last
we ever saw of Joe.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.375
And that's your story?

33:32.458 --> 33:33.500
Yeah.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.834
And Monty will say
the same thing?

33:35.917 --> 33:37.208
To the letter.

33:40.959 --> 33:42.250
Monty's wife called.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.875
She found a note from him
on their kitchen table.

33:45.875 --> 33:48.500
Said he was going off to die.

33:50.083 --> 33:52.417
Not exactly a road map.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.834
Where's does a guy like
Monty
go to end it?

33:56.709 --> 33:59.333
You live and die
in the mills.

33:59.417 --> 34:00.542
(Scotty)
'What's that?'

34:00.625 --> 34:01.875
When I was on
the phone with James

34:01.959 --> 34:04.709
that's what
Monty
said he'd do.

34:28.917 --> 34:31.291
(Lilly)
Easy does it there, Monty.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.542
I'm not doing nothing.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.000
Show us what you got
in your hand.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.667
Double-edged serrated blade?

34:42.750 --> 34:44.959
Guess we found
our murder weapon.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.458
You want a dry shave, son?

34:46.542 --> 34:48.500
Come on.
Stay with us here, Monty.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.375
I'm with ya.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.709
Just something we used to say
to each other.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.750
Goof around.

34:57.834 --> 34:58.917
(Lilly)
'Who?'

34:59.000 --> 35:00.583
'You and Joe?'

35:03.875 --> 35:06.333
What do you say
we talk about him?

35:08.417 --> 35:10.667
Last thing I want to do.

35:10.750 --> 35:13.083
So let's talk about Butch.

35:13.166 --> 35:16.000
'All these years,
and you're still tight.'

35:17.208 --> 35:18.291
Not really.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.041
(Lilly)
'No?'

35:20.125 --> 35:21.750
Why is that?

35:23.250 --> 35:25.458
He's a ghost.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.208
Reminder from my past.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.333
'Just like this place is.'

35:32.542 --> 35:37.000
Must've fixed this very loom,
say, dozen times.

35:37.083 --> 35:39.291
(Lilly)
'You're hard-working.'

35:39.375 --> 35:40.625
I respect that.

35:40.709 --> 35:42.625
Oh, it was tedious
more than anything.

35:42.709 --> 35:45.000
More so for the guy
who has dreams.

35:46.375 --> 35:50.041
'Yeah, everybody says,
have 'em, but, uh'

35:50.125 --> 35:52.333
when they don't pan out

35:52.417 --> 35:55.041
that's a whole
other story, right?

35:55.125 --> 35:57.792
Pretty sure having dreams
was my curse.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.542
See, I could fix a loom..

36:02.667 --> 36:05.208
...weave as well as the weavers.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.917
It was a good life..

36:10.458 --> 36:11.917
...for all of us..

36:22.500 --> 36:25.333
I wish I could've been like Joe.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
He was content.

36:28.583 --> 36:31.250
- But you weren't.
- No.

36:31.333 --> 36:33.083
You know, and Joe told me
that was a good thing.

36:33.166 --> 36:36.000
He said dreaming up stuff,
that was my gift.

36:36.083 --> 36:39.500
But you put a dreamer
and a chicken in the same
body

36:39.583 --> 36:41.500
and, mister,
you've
got problems.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.125
No, Monty!

36:46.333 --> 36:48.041
Don't take the easy way.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.667
No, it's the perfect way!

36:49.750 --> 36:52.083
I have been a bawking chicken
my whole life.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.291
Then do it!

36:54.291 --> 36:56.000
I want to see.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.125
'No, more.'

36:59.208 --> 37:00.667
I want to witness it.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.959
You want to watch me
kill myself?

37:04.041 --> 37:05.667
Yeah, no joke, Monty,
I want to see

37:05.750 --> 37:09.625
that last step
off of the bridge

37:11.125 --> 37:14.333
knowing you won't be
in this world anymore.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.834
Why?

37:16.917 --> 37:19.291
'Cause the ones
you leave behind.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.959
There are so many questions.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.500
'If I watch you..'

37:25.583 --> 37:26.959
...maybe I'll be able
to help your people.

37:27.041 --> 37:29.625
Well, I don't want you
to help my family!

37:29.709 --> 37:31.250
That's for me to do!

37:31.333 --> 37:34.709
But you got to choose, Monty.
It's up to you.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.500
That's the right thing.

38:06.834 --> 38:09.208
Chicken thing, you mean.

38:09.291 --> 38:10.375
(Scotty)
'No.'

38:11.250 --> 38:13.208
You're facing up.

38:20.458 --> 38:22.333
And now the rest, Monty.

38:25.208 --> 38:28.500
Talk about that last night
with Joe and Butch.

38:31.875 --> 38:34.875
It was the one time
I wasn't chicken.

38:36.417 --> 38:40.041
Ended up being the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.500
- Where you going?
- I'm going to go pay.

39:03.583 --> 39:05.208
- I'm up.
- I got it.

39:06.834 --> 39:08.667
My money not good
enough for you?

39:14.208 --> 39:16.709
We both know you don't have
five dollars to spare.

39:16.792 --> 39:18.208
Oh, you do, huh?

39:18.291 --> 39:20.583
Let's not any of us
be heroes.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.291
We split it
three ways.

39:24.917 --> 39:26.750
(Monty)
Show me.

39:26.834 --> 39:29.166
You got money? Let's see it.

39:32.583 --> 39:34.375
Up yours, Monty.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.417
Forget it.
It's my truck.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.583
I'm paying.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.750
(Butch)
'Yeah, you, too,
straw boss.'

39:39.834 --> 39:41.709
Up yours, too.

39:41.792 --> 39:43.291
- Come again?
- 'Well, you heard me.'

39:43.375 --> 39:44.959
What, you think
just because you got that
job

39:45.041 --> 39:46.208
now you walk
taller than
me?

39:46.291 --> 39:48.417
Johnstone never hired
on that job.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.959
The mill closed first.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.709
Yeah, but you knew
you had it in the
bag

39:51.792 --> 39:54.125
and so while none of
us
even got two nickels

39:54.208 --> 39:56.250
to put together,
you have that knowledge,
right?

39:56.333 --> 39:57.417
No.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.125
No, that job was still up
for grabs.

39:59.208 --> 40:00.709
My ass it was up for grabs!

40:00.792 --> 40:03.667
Monty pulled out of that job
because he knew

40:03.750 --> 40:04.792
that it was yours.

40:04.875 --> 40:05.959
I never pulled out
of no job.

40:06.041 --> 40:08.375
You pull out of everything!

40:08.458 --> 40:10.250
(Joe)
'What's it matter, huh?'

40:10.333 --> 40:13.125
We're fighting over something
that doesn't even exist.

40:13.208 --> 40:14.583
Which means what?

40:14.667 --> 40:19.458
Which means that you think
that having a bunch of big
ideas

40:19.542 --> 40:22.917
and no guts, is going to
feed
your family.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.333
You better press rewind
right now.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.709
[laughing]
Or what?

40:32.709 --> 40:35.500
Monty. Monty, put
that thing away!

40:35.583 --> 40:38.500
(Butch)
'Straw boss is right.'

40:38.583 --> 40:41.000
Put it down.
You look like a
jackass.

40:41.083 --> 40:43.375
I'm going to cut that lippy
tongue out of your mouth!

40:43.458 --> 40:44.834
Please, do it, do it!

40:44.917 --> 40:48.083
Come on, for once,
do something brave.

40:48.166 --> 40:51.041
- Do it.
- Guys, guys, we can't blow
up!

40:51.125 --> 40:54.375
We got to hang together...right?

41:18.417 --> 41:20.500
(Monty)
Oh, shit.
