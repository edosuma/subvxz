00:16.265 --> 00:20.771
The Game of Their Lives

00:21.021 --> 00:25.192
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Robert F. stadium Kennedy,

00:25.234 --> 00:27.778
All-Star Game for 2004.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.010
See? This is the kind of player
that always goes on.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.054
- Excuse me, Mr. McSkimming?
- Yes, why?

01:36.096 --> 01:40.767
- Hi I'm Matthew Tucker.
- Oh, sure. How are you? Sit.

01:40.809 --> 01:45.397
- Thank you. You like places?
- Yes, they are great.

01:45.439 --> 01:51.695
And by the way, you can call me Dent.
This is my granddaughter, Emily.

01:51.737 --> 01:55.866
- Striker, kick with both feet.
- Chaser, huh?

01:55.908 --> 01:58.993
It will be a star someday.

01:58.994 --> 02:03.206
Dent So, you thought in his time,
I would see a football match

02:03.207 --> 02:05.792
a stadium in the United States
as big as this?

02:05.834 --> 02:08.377
I always thought it would just
a matter of time

02:08.419 --> 02:12.591
so we reached the rest of the
world with our passion for the game.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.719
And you were single U.S. reporter

02:15.761 --> 02:18.764
World Cup 1950.
Right?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.890
I was just doing my job.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.935
I heard that he paid his
passage itself there.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.896
There was a lot of St.
Louisiana cared

02:26.897 --> 02:30.817
a lot from our boys and their adventure.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.737
But of course I
would in any way,

02:34.738 --> 02:38.658
even if there had
a business reason.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.786
- You want me to tell you everything?
- Yes, very much.

02:41.787 --> 02:48.001
- And where do I begin?
- How about the beginning?

02:48.043 --> 02:55.300
I and most of those guys,
were all from St. Louis

02:55.342 --> 02:59.429
In an area called "The Hill"
"La Montagna."

02:59.471 --> 03:05.227
Populated by Italian immigrants
at the turn of the century.

03:05.269 --> 03:10.940
Like many communities
immigrants across the U.S.,

03:10.941 --> 03:17.238
"The Hill" had a foot in the old
continent, and another in the new world.

03:17.239 --> 03:20.325
Very proud of the two places.

03:20.367 --> 03:26.080
An area of?? approximately
20 square blocks.

03:26.081 --> 03:31.795
"The Hill" was small and contained.

03:31.837 --> 03:39.837
His world revolved around work
hard, family, food and the Church.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.308
Neighbors knew each
other and their children and cousins.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.477
And who was a devotee of St. Ambrose
and who was not.

03:50.606 --> 03:56.862
All went to Sunday Mass,
weddings and funerals...

04:04.119 --> 04:05.704
You're late.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.673
Harry, my friend, you sound like
that will have a heart attack.

04:17.716 --> 04:22.929
I have to be Northside
before the end of the day.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.016
Tell a Soul, that the search at 7:00.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.142
Another English lesson?

04:28.143 --> 04:32.314
Sure, I'll take her to the movies
is a good place to learn.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.441
Because she needs
learn English if it is

04:35.442 --> 04:38.529
back to Guadalajara in 2 weeks?

04:39.571 --> 04:40.614
See ya!

04:59.925 --> 05:02.009
Let's get on the floor.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.096
We have to be
Northside in 20 minutes.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.900
Gino! It's time, come on.

05:27.536 --> 05:31.206
People of "The Hill" loved baseball.

05:31.248 --> 05:34.835
Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola grew up there.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.005
But his greatest passion was
reserved for football

05:38.046 --> 05:42.176
Or, as we call it here, soccer.

06:01.945 --> 06:08.242
In "The Hill" on any given day, you could
find the best players in the country

06:08.243 --> 06:13.957
Frank Borghi, played baseball and
was potential for a professional league.

06:13.999 --> 06:19.713
Frank had a nose for the ball, and ability
to prevent it from going into the goal.

06:19.755 --> 06:23.842
No comparison with
any goalie I've ever seen.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.929
And I've seen enough.
It was my job

06:26.970 --> 06:33.227
inform about the St. Louisianas
local semi-professional teams and leagues.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.311
For me, it was not working.

06:35.312 --> 06:40.566
It was a daily pleasure in
Players to watch

06:40.567 --> 06:45.780
could play in any
place in the highest level.

06:45.781 --> 06:49.408
As Gino Parian, fast and strong,

06:49.409 --> 06:53.080
giving great passes and scoring goals.

06:53.121 --> 06:57.209
Gino played even better with the
Francis "Pee Wee" Wallace.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.295
A "Pee Wee" he played the field.

07:00.337 --> 07:06.092
In the field he was all
Seriously, playing with a

07:06.093 --> 07:11.807
intensity as no
another in St. Louis.

07:11.849 --> 07:18.063
A great striker fast, agile.
He was always working toward the goal.

07:18.105 --> 07:23.818
Attacking alone or
with Gino. There was

07:23.819 --> 07:29.575
denying the ability
Pee Wee Wallace

07:37.875 --> 07:39.960
Looking for this?

07:48.302 --> 07:54.599
He also had Charlie Colombo, dubbed
of "Gloves" because he always wore gloves.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.686
He liked to use force.
Correctly answered at all.

07:57.728 --> 08:01.899
Never a player who competed with
he did not want to put in the hospital.

08:01.940 --> 08:08.113
- No!
- What are you talking about? one bid was clean.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.242
Charlie Gloves, play nice.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.868
Hey! what are you doing?
Is helping the enemy?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.412
I am dating his sister.

08:15.454 --> 08:16.455
So what?

08:31.094 --> 08:34.181
Harry Keough. Smart, smart.

08:34.222 --> 08:39.436
Always seemed to be in
right place at the right time.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.376
That's right guys, good game.

09:07.589 --> 09:12.803
- Hey, Harry. where it came from?
- That was for you Borghi.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.888
- Nice kick.
- Great game Frank.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.890
Thank you.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.976
Anyway,
let's talk about your goal.

09:19.017 --> 09:23.730
Well, to mark the Borghi, or
you are very good or very lucky.

09:23.772 --> 09:28.402
- And today I was very lucky.
- You always moves to the left of the ball

09:28.443 --> 09:30.486
Yeah, I do not really work
with the other leg.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.238
Now you need to working speed.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.239
I know.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.286
How about a train
shortly after the games?

09:38.287 --> 09:41.957
That sounds good.

09:41.999 --> 09:47.212
I waited a little until the paperwork
solve, but now it's official.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.340
Tests for the football team
U.S.,

09:50.382 --> 09:53.385
will be made here in St. Louis.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.304
The teams come from the east
here to play with

09:56.305 --> 09:59.183
best in our area next Friday.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.059
When is the best team
chosen, we will go to

10:02.060 --> 10:04.897
New York to train.
And make an exhibition game.

10:04.938 --> 10:09.067
And then we go to Brazil.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.194
We will play at least
3 games in our key.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.280
How long will all this take?

10:14.323 --> 10:18.452
There will be 10 days of training and
maybe 2 or 3 weeks off.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.622
It will be difficult for some of us
take time out of our work.

10:21.663 --> 10:26.752
Gentlemen, I apologize for the short
time, I know it will be difficult.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.420
Will be happy to
know who will win $ 100

10:29.421 --> 10:32.007
per week, $ 5 per day for food.

10:32.049 --> 10:36.178
And do not forget, this is a trip
free to New York and Brazil.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.349
What is the problem, Gino?

10:43.519 --> 10:48.190
No way, I can not do that.
I'm getting married in two weeks.

10:48.732 --> 10:53.904
- Dino the girl is crazy about you.
- Charlie quiet

10:53.946 --> 10:57.032
Look, you'll have to postpone it Gino
we need you.

10:57.074 --> 11:01.202
Walter can not do that,
the invitations have been delivered.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.288
Everything is already marked

11:03.330 --> 11:06.375
My God, I really
I wish I could go.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.587
Do not worry, Gino, do not worry. And
anyway, what is the purpose of going?

11:10.629 --> 11:14.757
For us to be killed by a gang
professional players?

11:14.758 --> 11:19.470
And as we went to
last Olympics, Harry?

11:19.471 --> 11:24.183
I say, shame we
9-0 to Italy.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.313
Gino, you know?
I think I will not miss anything.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.397
You know, Pee Wee?

11:29.398 --> 11:31.501
In my mind, should be a
privilege to represent your country

11:31.525 --> 11:34.611
No matter how difficult
circumstances.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.741
How many here are veterans of the army?

11:39.783 --> 11:43.452
Sure, in my
opinion, the best football

11:43.453 --> 11:47.082
that country is played
right here in St. Louis.

11:47.124 --> 11:50.210
And I ask you to represent
the colors of that country

11:50.252 --> 11:52.296
the biggest event in the world.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.022
- This one is right?
- Yes

12:12.107 --> 12:15.235
- Your mother wants to see you.
- What?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.321
His mother wants to see you.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.449
It cleaned everything for the funeral.

12:23.577 --> 12:27.748
Your Uncle Joe told me you
is asking for 3 weeks out

12:27.789 --> 12:31.960
- To go play your game this?
- Yes, I asked him, he said okay.

12:33.003 --> 12:36.631
Of course, he said. He
this is crazy for soccer.

12:36.632 --> 12:40.302
I told him that you will not.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.347
Embalming School
begins in three weeks.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.518
- And you can not miss classes.
- School of embalming?

12:47.559 --> 12:49.644
Mother, how many times I gotta tell you,

12:49.645 --> 12:51.730
I'm not going to
school of embalming?

12:51.772 --> 12:53.815
Just because you do not want.

12:54.858 --> 12:59.028
You do not want to improve your life?

12:59.029 --> 13:03.241
This is the family business, right here.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.370
We will not have this conversation,
not again.

13:07.412 --> 13:12.626
Already a grown man and still
chasing these kids!

13:12.668 --> 13:15.754
- That children play!
- Frank?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.883
I'm starting to get crazy.

13:20.926 --> 13:25.055
How many times do I have to tell her
that's not what I do?

13:25.097 --> 13:30.101
What is it, Frank, you know
she has good intentions.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.604
She just wants the best for you.

13:33.438 --> 13:37.651
No, actually Mary, she
knows what is best for me.

13:42.865 --> 13:46.994
Let's get something to eat.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.163
Sorry love, I have
find the boys tonight.

13:50.205 --> 13:55.294
- I promise I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.840
Then you do it?
Will participate in testing?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.390
Yes, I will.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.018
Do not be late.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.446
Joe has to take that hit.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.616
Frank, you always had a
grip better than his.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.745
Thank you Mr. Pee Wee, but you
have not answered my question.

14:29.828 --> 14:34.917
- What question?
- Will you be there tomorrow?

14:34.958 --> 14:36.375
I can not do that.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.128
What are you talking about,
"Can not do that"?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.214
I can not do that.

14:41.215 --> 14:45.385
That makes no sense, Pee Wee.
You know you have to be part of it.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.471
We always play together.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.640
Not to mention that you love the game
more than anyone I know.

14:50.641 --> 14:51.683
That's it

14:52.726 --> 14:56.896
And you and Gino are a great team.

14:56.897 --> 15:01.068
Furthermore, we
would have so much fun.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.197
Giesler said that we
have to fly to Brazil.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.241
- I can not do that.
- That's the problem?

15:07.282 --> 15:12.496
- I can not fly. - This is not a
problem. - Of course it's a problem.

15:12.538 --> 15:16.667
Ask God's protection,
and everything will be fine.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.751
On the plane?

15:18.752 --> 15:22.965
Hear that?
We have two bases occupied.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.801
I understand, I understand,
that's the plan.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.220
We were so drunk before
to get on that plane I

15:29.221 --> 15:32.349
I guarantee you will not even
realize that the trip happened.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.935
What do you say?

15:35.477 --> 15:39.606
You know about me and
Frank small places.

15:43.777 --> 15:47.865
Pee Wee, what happened
you 6 years ago?

15:51.118 --> 15:55.247
That time I spent
hospitalized because...

15:55.289 --> 15:59.458
as they call it, the trauma of war?
How often do you think?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.546
It feels really bad.

16:02.588 --> 16:07.676
Guys? Stan the Man will come.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.016
And he catches the ball,
Wallace and go to...

16:14.099 --> 16:15.099
Ok, that's the goal!

16:19.229 --> 16:21.315
Trying to kill me?

16:25.485 --> 16:31.742
- Let's go to Randazzo.
- I can not, I see Janet.

16:31.783 --> 16:36.455
If you show up so soon
she'll throw your ass on the street.

16:36.496 --> 16:41.168
Yes, Janet and what would you
would be a lot worse crap.

16:41.210 --> 16:44.254
Yeah!

16:44.296 --> 16:48.383
- Did you just say "crap"?
- I think so.

16:48.425 --> 16:53.137
I must be drunk.

16:53.138 --> 16:57.768
If this keeps up
will say "shit" soon!

16:57.809 --> 16:59.894
Ok guys, let me
go have the test tomorrow.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.980
Let's drink to Randazzo.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.066
Tomorrow is the test, no, no.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.406
Are you okay?

17:19.748 --> 17:21.750
Hey Gino, what's the problem?

17:21.834 --> 17:28.048
I just wanted to be on the team.
I just wanted to be on the team.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.091
I know.

17:32.219 --> 17:40.219
You are the best striker
world. It really is, Gino.

17:40.602 --> 17:44.648
And you will spend the rest
life with her, right?

17:48.944 --> 17:54.116
Everyone thinks you will be there,
punching bag on the team there.

17:54.199 --> 17:58.245
Nobody said it goes with the Pee Wee.

17:58.287 --> 18:04.751
No matter, Frankie does not matter,
I want to be on this team.

18:05.627 --> 18:09.756
- I know.
- I just want to be on the team.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.696
Sit, Sit!

18:34.781 --> 18:37.910
I told you man, never appear later.
This is an insult.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.038
I do not want my daughter treated
that way!

18:41.079 --> 18:44.165
Sorry, Silvio.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.293
In my house it is
considered an offense.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.878
Pee Wee said...

18:48.879 --> 18:50.463
Stop talking about
Pee Wee, shut up!

18:50.464 --> 18:54.593
There are more things
important to talk about.

18:54.635 --> 18:59.848
Now I have a test for selection
United States Soccer tomorrow.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.935
I've told them that
could not participate.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.020
Mr. Walter Giesler
came to ask my help.

19:05.062 --> 19:09.191
- Mr. Giesler, he came here?
- You talk too much

19:09.233 --> 19:12.319
Just listen at least once.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.363
Mr. Geizler.

19:14.404 --> 19:18.575
He talked about the great honor
it would be for this family,

19:18.617 --> 19:22.746
to this community,
La Montagne, for this nation.

19:22.788 --> 19:26.958
If you wear the uniform
the United States.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.044
Do you agree with him?

19:33.215 --> 19:37.302
- I agree.
- Of course you agree, that's right!

19:37.344 --> 19:40.472
- But the Lord has a little problem...
- There is no problem.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.516
You will be in the testing tomorrow.

19:42.558 --> 19:46.728
The team travels next Sunday and we
out a couple of weeks, so...

19:46.770 --> 19:48.814
Dad, just tell him.

19:49.857 --> 19:52.985
We've changed, you
married on Saturday.

19:53.026 --> 19:57.154
But the church, the church and the hall...

19:57.155 --> 20:01.869
While you were out getting
drunk I was fixing everything.

20:01.910 --> 20:06.582
- Except for the invitations.
- That you will do tomorrow after testing.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.796
Good enough for you?

20:15.924 --> 20:19.052
Do not do it again.
And there he goes again with tears.

20:19.094 --> 20:25.309
Never in my life
I saw a man cry so much.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.150
What you know about
these guys from the east coast, Frank?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.360
A little.

20:35.777 --> 20:40.073
- I've played against some of them.
- Walter Bahr E?

20:44.119 --> 20:50.292
He knows what he does.
And any one bag is good at it too.

20:50.334 --> 20:56.590
Pay attention to Clarkie Souza.
Phenomenal, a kind of magic with the ball.

20:56.632 --> 21:01.803
Well fast.
And Ed Mcllvenny, Scotland.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.889
One of the best around.

21:07.017 --> 21:11.229
Then Pee Wee will appear?

21:11.230 --> 21:13.273
I do not know.

21:13.315 --> 21:17.486
Okay, guys, we are not interested
in which team makes more goals.

21:17.528 --> 21:20.531
We look for individual play.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.657
And that means not
only what they do alone,

21:22.658 --> 21:24.743
but how to make your team better.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.829
This game will be refereed
like any other.

21:27.871 --> 21:33.043
If expelled, too
will be off the team.

21:33.085 --> 21:39.341
As you know the coach is Bill Jeffrey
selection. Bill has something to say?

21:40.384 --> 21:47.599
Remember, this is a game
gentlemen, then play as such.

21:48.767 --> 21:54.022
All right, gentlemen.
Let's start.

21:56.066 --> 21:59.152
I keep saying that
I do not get on that plane.

22:13.750 --> 22:19.005
It was clear to anyone watching, that
Both teams had a very different style.

22:19.006 --> 22:25.554
The east coast played with discipline
and accuracy. A thin type of football.

22:26.346 --> 22:31.476
The team played St. Louis
more improvisation.

23:13.185 --> 23:16.313
Lift, son of Yale.

23:17.356 --> 23:20.483
I do not study at Yale,
his Neanderthal.

23:20.484 --> 23:24.655
Neanderthal? what is it?
I never studied at a college.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.766
Good job.

23:52.808 --> 23:57.521
Jeffrey? I Dent McSkimming
I cover football for the St. Louis Post.

23:57.563 --> 24:02.192
You just said that the city
is a reporter for football only?

24:02.234 --> 24:05.863
I'm sure you heard how
this sport is important here?

24:05.904 --> 24:09.491
I thought it was Walter Giesler
just trying to impress me.

24:09.533 --> 24:13.704
The Italians are here in The Hill
organized soccer for over 45 years.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.748
I have seen and covered the
sport across the country.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.918
Not the best place to
football players St. Louis.

24:19.960 --> 24:24.047
Yes, but I have to disagree.

24:24.089 --> 24:28.218
Say the name of a better
goalkeeper Frank Borghi?

24:28.260 --> 24:32.431
Did you see Pee Wee Wallace. anyone on the
team East compares to him as the attacker.

24:32.472 --> 24:36.642
- We were watching the same game?
- Charlie Colombo.

24:36.643 --> 24:39.730
Any team needs
a Charlie Colombo.

24:39.771 --> 24:44.985
Gino Parian, Harry Keough, Bob Annis.
They are all world class players.

24:46.028 --> 24:52.784
- Have a question for me, Mr...?
- McSkimming

24:53.285 --> 24:55.370
I hope not.

24:57.456 --> 25:02.628
Come on guys, no one
died, are just tests.

25:02.669 --> 25:06.088
I know it's only a test
but we will defeat them.

25:06.089 --> 25:09.468
They play like sissies

25:09.510 --> 25:12.887
But Walter Bahr is strong
rather, it is not, Charlie?

25:12.888 --> 25:16.265
Who asked you to talk to me?

25:16.266 --> 25:20.437
Bahr is fooling himself,
as if doing a show here.

25:20.479 --> 25:23.482
I'm doing my best
to put him on a stretcher.

25:23.565 --> 25:28.695
Why do not you stop with that
crap? Kick the ball, not the guy.

25:28.737 --> 25:33.951
If you are kicked out of this team you selection
is not going to, you know that right?

25:33.992 --> 25:37.037
Pee Wee, what's wrong with you

25:37.079 --> 25:42.292
Is trying not to join the team?
Come on, put your head in the game!

25:42.334 --> 25:45.419
Gino, I want you and Pee
using each other

25:45.420 --> 25:49.633
It's time for you
two work their magic.

26:04.189 --> 26:08.318
In the second half, the best
players on the field proved.

26:08.360 --> 26:14.616
Pee Wee Wallace woke up at Gino
became a fatal combination ever.

26:26.128 --> 26:29.214
But that was an incentive for them

26:29.256 --> 26:33.427
Clarkie Sousa, Ed Mcllvenny
and Walter Bahr.

26:57.409 --> 27:01.580
Do not do it.
We need him on the team.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.751
One more and he is out.

27:42.246 --> 27:45.332
That was good, but not so good.

27:49.503 --> 27:52.631
- I think he'll call me.
- Me too.

27:59.930 --> 28:03.057
I do not like it there.

28:03.058 --> 28:05.184
Bahr thinks is
helping him to choose?

28:05.185 --> 28:07.271
Better not be.

28:12.484 --> 28:16.613
Hi Frank. Meet Walter, Walter Bahr?

28:16.655 --> 28:18.699
I was just wondering
if this guy was

28:18.740 --> 28:20.784
helping you to make choices?

28:20.826 --> 28:23.871
Yes, we hear his opinions.

28:23.912 --> 28:29.126
- Well, if I would mind too?
- Yes, I care.

28:29.168 --> 28:33.297
Okay, leaving the two here.
I'll let you know.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.636
And when they heard the
boys from St. Louis had

28:40.637 --> 28:43.764
something to celebrate besides
Gino's wedding.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.894
Frank, Harry, Gloves, Pee Wee
and Gino joined the team.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.364
Let's get outta here baby!

29:07.623 --> 29:09.791
Put me down!

29:13.045 --> 29:16.173
- I have something for you!
- For me?

29:16.298 --> 29:18.383
Congratulations.

29:22.346 --> 29:26.517
Charlie, What is he doing?

29:26.558 --> 29:30.646
- Thank you.
- Get out of here.

29:31.688 --> 29:34.816
Everyone please dance with us.

29:47.329 --> 29:50.499
Congratulations on the team.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.883
- Pee Wee, come here.
- Ok Mr. Abruzzo.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.969
Congratulations Pee Wee.

30:05.055 --> 30:10.269
It's very exciting to be chosen
for the team and go to Brazil?

30:13.397 --> 30:18.610
Sit down here, Frank.
Excuse us for a second, ok, Fiora?

30:18.652 --> 30:22.781
- Even more Pee Wee.
- Bye Fiora

30:24.908 --> 30:29.079
- Monte Christo.
- Oh Mr. Abruzzo, thank you

30:34.293 --> 30:38.422
Being chosen for the
U.S. team.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.507
A great honor.

30:56.148 --> 31:00.319
Want to know why football
is the greatest game in the world?

31:00.360 --> 31:05.573
I'll tell you. Because everything you
need is a ball and an open place.

31:05.574 --> 31:08.702
Do not need any
equipment or special courts.

31:08.744 --> 31:12.789
You need not be
big, strong or high.

31:12.831 --> 31:19.087
It is the most democratic of all sports.
The people's game.

31:19.129 --> 31:25.344
The game of his people. And the game
of the future of the United States.

31:26.386 --> 31:30.557
So when I congratulate him
join the team for the United States,

31:30.599 --> 31:32.642
I see the look on his face,

31:32.643 --> 31:35.811
as if he had been elected
President of the United States.

31:35.812 --> 31:40.984
And not what I just saw.

31:41.026 --> 31:45.197
Now get out of here and
let me finish my game of cards.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.496
Until you proud to be one of

31:53.497 --> 31:55.582
best players
United States Soccer,

31:55.624 --> 31:59.711
You do not deserve one of these.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.881
Fiora Hey, come on, let's finish the game.

32:12.307 --> 32:15.435
St. Kitts for a safe journey.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.821
It's beautiful.

32:28.949 --> 32:32.077
Thanks, Dad

32:34.162 --> 32:37.291
But do not bother...

32:38.333 --> 32:41.461
Janet I have to go, gotta go
Until more.

32:42.504 --> 32:46.717
Take care of it! okay?

32:49.845 --> 32:54.016
- Janet, I love you!
- I love you too.

32:57.102 --> 33:02.274
I will go to Guadalajara,
and wait until I say yes.

33:02.316 --> 33:06.485
Better not do that,
my father will kill you

33:06.486 --> 33:10.657
go up there looking for me.
He protects me too.

33:11.742 --> 33:16.914
So die fighting
for something I believe.

33:22.169 --> 33:27.341
- I will miss you.
- Me too.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.967
I'll be back before you know it.

33:29.968 --> 33:32.554
Frank, I'm really proud of you.

33:32.638 --> 33:34.640
- I love you.
- I love you too.

33:34.681 --> 33:36.725
Gotta go.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.005
- Hey, Frank, we are on track?
- We're almost there.

34:13.262 --> 34:15.304
This is it. Broadway Hotel.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.987
- What's your problem buddy?
- How do you know my name?

34:30.987 --> 34:35.157
- How should I know what is his name.
- Joe, Joe Maca.

34:35.158 --> 34:38.286
So what?

34:39.329 --> 34:43.417
You must be the guys
Italian St. Louis, right?

34:43.458 --> 34:45.210
Yes, we are.

34:45.710 --> 34:49.214
Well, welcome the Plaza, guys.

34:52.842 --> 34:53.844
I am hungry.

34:53.886 --> 34:57.014
Let's eat Italian food
in honor of my Italian friends

34:57.054 --> 35:02.268
It can be a great pizza.
Jews are boys.

35:02.269 --> 35:06.315
- Who's coming?
- I do not know, I have no idea.

35:09.568 --> 35:13.739
- Belo Jew, Frank.
- What will you cook in the hotel?

35:13.780 --> 35:17.910
- Not too bad.
- It's good.

35:17.951 --> 35:21.997
Look at them there, how are guys?

35:22.039 --> 35:28.295
- How was your trip?
- The boys from St. Louis.

35:28.337 --> 35:31.422
What happens here?

35:31.423 --> 35:33.508
You remember
Clarkie Souza, is not it?

35:33.509 --> 35:35.594
He dribbled around
you on Saturday.

35:35.636 --> 35:38.722
How are you?

35:38.764 --> 35:42.934
And this is Ed Souza.
Believe it or not, are not related.

35:42.935 --> 35:46.021
Who works here?

35:46.063 --> 35:52.236
I am with your keys and your tasks.

35:52.319 --> 35:55.947
Hey Gloves, which says
take a bath, we

35:55.948 --> 35:59.535
Toots Shors and to the left
Joe Di Maggio.

35:59.576 --> 36:02.703
Tomorrow at 9:00 will be the
training. And the next day

36:02.704 --> 36:05.832
play with a team
semiprofessional here in NY.

36:05.874 --> 36:10.002
So if you,
sleep the rest of the night.

36:10.003 --> 36:14.215
That's pretty funny, because
you and I'm not leaving.

36:14.216 --> 36:19.388
The training will have at least 3 hours

36:19.429 --> 36:22.558
We have about a
week to hit this time.

36:22.599 --> 36:25.644
Oh, you're willing to teach us?

36:25.686 --> 36:29.313
I am organizing
workouts, and while

36:29.314 --> 36:32.943
Mr. Jeffrey is
I will give out the training.

36:32.985 --> 36:36.029
- Is there a problem with that?
- Yes, I have purpose.

36:36.071 --> 36:39.199
Frank was here at all times in
I have been if he tells me to do something

36:39.241 --> 36:42.327
I do, but I do not hear from you.

36:42.452 --> 36:44.538
None of us will

36:45.455 --> 36:48.584
Okay, give the list to Frank.

36:48.625 --> 36:52.254
By the way, I do not like
taking orders from a Kraut.

36:58.010 --> 37:03.182
Yes I am of German descent,
and foremost I am American.

37:03.265 --> 37:07.352
Okay, enough.

37:08.395 --> 37:13.609
Tell me Wallace, you are a
or an American?

37:13.650 --> 37:17.779
- Come on, Walter.
- Go to hell.

37:19.865 --> 37:25.120
Let's get some drinks,
who comes to me?

37:34.505 --> 37:38.634
The first training match against the team

37:38.675 --> 37:42.804
the semi-
Brooklyn was a disaster.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.891
The right foot did not know what the
left foot was doing.

37:45.933 --> 37:48.559
There was an evident difference
styles of boys

37:48.560 --> 37:51.146
East Coast and
boys from St. Louis.

37:51.188 --> 37:57.444
But no joke, it seemed impossible
fix the major problems

38:04.743 --> 38:06.827
Pee Wee what is
doing? It was his face,

38:06.828 --> 38:08.914
your job, what are you doing?

38:08.956 --> 38:13.043
My work, what do you mean?
're running the whole field

38:13.126 --> 38:16.171
that guy over there because their
can not hold the ball.

38:16.213 --> 38:19.258
Pee and I have played with
long time for this.

38:19.299 --> 38:22.427
The guy can not hold college
the ball for more than a second and a half.

38:22.469 --> 38:28.684
Okay! is it folks! Good game,
Thank you gentlemen. That's enough.

38:32.896 --> 38:34.940
What the hell is happening?

38:34.982 --> 38:39.152
- He finished the game?
- What did you do?

38:42.281 --> 38:46.451
- Not going anywhere like this.
- They are the best available.

38:46.493 --> 38:49.538
Maybe for one game
Sunday in North Hampton.

38:49.580 --> 38:51.623
We need someone as Joe Gaetjens.

38:51.665 --> 38:54.710
Gaetjens, this is not possible.

38:54.751 --> 38:57.378
I thought it was about getting
top players

38:57.379 --> 38:59.965
the country to be the
more competitive as possible.

39:00.007 --> 39:03.134
Walter, we have 10
days to train together,

39:03.135 --> 39:06.262
before we play against teams

39:06.263 --> 39:11.435
who live and play together 365 days a year.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.561
The United States does not
be competitive

39:13.562 --> 39:15.647
World Cup in the next 50 years.

39:15.939 --> 39:16.982
Our work...

39:18.442 --> 39:21.486
Our job is to attend

39:21.570 --> 39:24.281
and act as good ambassadors.

39:26.074 --> 39:29.161
All I care is
get the best team on the field.

39:30.204 --> 39:34.374
- I really need Gaetjens.
- It will not happen.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.503
Come on.

39:40.631 --> 39:42.716
What's happening?

39:42.758 --> 39:47.970
We will make this team better.
You want to play to win. right?

39:47.971 --> 39:52.142
Yeah, but you could have
finished the game first.

40:07.741 --> 40:10.868
- Joe Gaetjens!
- Yes?

40:10.869 --> 40:15.582
Walter Bahr, Frank Borghi is this.

40:15.624 --> 40:20.254
I know you. Wanting a rematch?

40:20.295 --> 40:24.466
You never know. By the way, come
request to join our team.

40:24.508 --> 40:26.510
What time is it?

40:26.552 --> 40:29.638
The selection of the United States
for the World Cup.

40:29.680 --> 40:33.767
- And there's this team?
- Has been organized very quickly.

40:33.809 --> 40:36.937
That's why we need you,
you adapt to any style of play.

40:36.979 --> 40:42.109
Yes, but what your style of play?

40:42.150 --> 40:46.321
We do not have a style of play.
But we're working on it.

40:52.619 --> 40:56.789
I love America, then
I'm inside. Where do I start?

40:56.790 --> 40:58.834
Tomorrow morning, 6:30.

40:58.876 --> 41:03.046
We are playing in the field Werthman
in Long Island City.

41:03.088 --> 41:08.218
- We are going to Brazil in 6 days.
- In Brazil?

41:12.389 --> 41:15.475
One problem, my work.

41:15.517 --> 41:21.773
You- .. we will receive $ 100
per week, plus $ 5 supply.

41:21.815 --> 41:24.276
- Really?
- I'm in!

41:35.370 --> 41:41.585
- Nice to meet you Joe.
- Brazil!

41:45.756 --> 41:50.969
- This is a strange guy.
- Yes it is, but it is a phenomenal athlete.

41:51.011 --> 41:56.182
I saw him playing and Eddie Sousa

41:56.183 --> 42:00.354
You really think he
will be enough to make a difference?

42:00.395 --> 42:04.023
Frank, I need to believe
that this team is good.

42:04.024 --> 42:07.694
I need them to believe
also, they listen to you.

42:07.736 --> 42:09.779
I see players
we have now and see

42:09.780 --> 42:11.865
a team with which to
difficult to play against.

42:11.907 --> 42:14.910
We will surprise
people that way, Frank.

42:14.993 --> 42:19.122
So you really think we can
go to Brazil, and in fact, win a game?

42:19.164 --> 42:21.166
Yes, yes, I think.

42:21.208 --> 42:25.379
Never set foot in a field if I did not
think that my team could win, ever.

42:25.420 --> 42:29.550
And I bet you never thought that the goal
any team would score on you right?

42:29.591 --> 42:32.678
No, but I was not playing
against the best teams in the world.

42:32.719 --> 42:36.890
This has to do with believing.
Always so.

42:38.976 --> 42:42.062
Let me ask you something?

42:42.104 --> 42:45.231
Why did you want me to come with
you to call this guy, Joe?

42:45.232 --> 42:48.360
You could have done it alone.

42:48.402 --> 42:51.405
Why can not I do it myself,
need your support.

42:51.446 --> 42:54.574
You saw how those guys are

42:54.575 --> 42:57.703
need you to help me
to put this team together.

43:01.874 --> 43:06.043
You really believe that.

43:06.044 --> 43:11.258
I assume that everyone here has
heard the name Stanley Mortenson.

43:11.300 --> 43:14.927
Stanley Mortenson, an undeniably

43:14.928 --> 43:18.599
of the best players
the last 50 years.

43:18.640 --> 43:22.226
He is currently
on a U.S. tour

43:22.227 --> 43:25.856
and Canada with a team
choice of aces

43:25.939 --> 43:28.984
with the best players
English first division.

43:29.026 --> 43:34.198
And they agreed to
play with us tomorrow.

43:38.368 --> 43:41.495
Right here.

43:41.496 --> 43:43.789
Excuse me, when
we get our uniforms?

43:43.790 --> 43:44.625
I'm working on it.

43:44.666 --> 43:48.836
Remember, your
Passports have to be

43:48.837 --> 43:53.008
in the hands of up to 12
later on Wednesday.

43:53.050 --> 43:57.178
The flight will be in
Friday, midnight.

43:57.179 --> 44:01.308
You will all be
outside the hotel at 10:00.

44:01.391 --> 44:04.394
What are they doing here?

44:04.436 --> 44:09.608
Coach... that guy Wellfit,
whatever it was his name.

44:09.650 --> 44:13.820
Not well, got sick and had to
go home and asked me to tell you.

44:13.862 --> 44:17.991
- Because he did not tell me?
- Okay, let's play!

44:19.576 --> 44:20.619
Frank?

44:21.161 --> 44:23.247
Do not ask me
Coach, I do not know.

44:46.144 --> 44:49.273
Who is this?

45:01.827 --> 45:05.956
Hey, are you Catholic?

45:05.998 --> 45:11.170
I'm not no, but I'm very
respect for the faith. much respect

45:21.597 --> 45:25.767
Listen I was thinking, if we continue
playing more compact will work.

45:25.809 --> 45:29.855
- I do not agree.
- Hey, calm down! Calm down!

45:36.236 --> 45:38.321
The problem is that we are
killing on counter-attacks.

45:38.322 --> 45:40.407
It is not our ability
is our training.

45:40.449 --> 45:43.452
All going forward,
and no one on the side.

45:43.535 --> 45:47.623
Then they go through is what we
a training need is, stability.

45:47.664 --> 45:53.420
There will be four guys back, four in the middle
and you in front with Joe Gaetjens there.

45:53.462 --> 45:59.133
- You can not score with that formation.
- We have to start thinking about defense.

45:59.134 --> 46:01.219
It is a defense against their attackers.

46:01.220 --> 46:03.346
You will not make the record
goals in a World Cup.

46:03.347 --> 46:05.431
Listen to Walter, the
problem is that we have

46:05.432 --> 46:07.517
played in a training
throughout our lives.

46:07.518 --> 46:11.647
Changing this could be a disaster,
let's just play!

46:11.688 --> 46:16.902
Wait! Just doing a
suggestion, a suggestion urgent

46:16.944 --> 46:19.988
But if you want to be
humiliated in Brazil is well.

46:20.072 --> 46:24.117
He's right.
Yes he's right.

46:24.159 --> 46:26.662
We played like a bunch of crap.

46:26.995 --> 46:31.375
I say, not without the ball
know where to go.

46:33.335 --> 46:36.380
Like a leaf is swept downstream.

46:36.713 --> 46:44.713
- Walter, we need this training.
- I agree with Joe.

46:45.055 --> 46:50.227
Wait!

46:50.269 --> 46:52.354
Frank, what do you think?

46:56.483 --> 47:00.654
Why not use the first time?

47:00.696 --> 47:04.825
If not we can switch.

47:04.867 --> 47:05.826
Good

47:05.868 --> 47:08.996
Sure, it's good for everyone?

47:14.251 --> 47:17.379
Stay tuned!

47:29.850 --> 47:33.979
Well there is one
greatest players of this century.

47:34.021 --> 47:39.234
You will be able to tell your grandchildren
who played against Stanley Mortenson.

47:39.276 --> 47:42.362
Not if he scored against me.

47:44.448 --> 47:49.661
The way I understand, it's just a player
trying to make me look bad.

47:49.703 --> 47:53.331
He is so agile, so flows
easy, you do not even notice

47:53.332 --> 47:57.002
how fast he is until he shows.

47:57.044 --> 48:00.088
What you got for me?

48:00.130 --> 48:06.345
Do not believe it goes right,
because it goes left.

48:07.387 --> 48:10.474
There is a problem with the English,

48:10.516 --> 48:14.185
They think that just because
invented this game

48:14.186 --> 48:17.814
they have a divine destiny
to be the best.

48:17.856 --> 48:21.985
Why do you think I'm on your side?

48:58.522 --> 49:01.608
Jeffrey?

49:01.650 --> 49:05.279
- When we receive the uniforms?
- I'm working on it.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.949
We flew to Brazil in two days.
They will be ready by then?

49:08.991 --> 49:11.034
I hope so.

49:14.121 --> 49:16.205
Jeffrey knows, it is
difficult to make other

49:16.206 --> 49:18.292
teams to take us
seriously the way it is,

49:18.417 --> 49:21.961
even if we appear
a bunch of clowns.

49:21.962 --> 49:25.507
We will have no chance.

49:32.931 --> 49:35.016
Clarkie, you're the guy
faster than we have.

49:35.017 --> 49:37.101
Stan Mortenson stick in the whole game.

49:37.102 --> 49:41.273
Do not let him get the ball, do not let
he does, do not let him do anything.

49:41.315 --> 49:44.401
Do us all a favor take
these guys from their faces.

49:44.443 --> 49:49.573
Gaetjens, help in the midfield ok?

49:49.698 --> 49:54.786
Guys, this is a great game
for everyone. We can do it.

50:28.153 --> 50:34.409
The Americans began to
new line of defense and energy.

50:34.535 --> 50:40.791
But after they hold at the beginning of
first time, the ground started to open.

51:30.757 --> 51:34.385
The English, as a whole, with
exception of Stanley Mortenson

51:34.386 --> 51:38.015
failed to make your team,
I was going to the World Cup,

51:38.056 --> 51:40.142
gain control of the game.

51:40.225 --> 51:45.314
But they easily show the
weaknesses of the American team.

52:11.381 --> 52:16.094
Stanley Mortenson was no doubt
the best player on the field.

52:16.136 --> 52:20.765
And after a while they started
playing with great confidence.

52:20.766 --> 52:23.893
Almost contemptuously, as if they knew

52:23.894 --> 52:27.064
that Americans do not
were scored against them.

52:35.405 --> 52:39.576
"Shall not be permitted
language 'profane' in some hours."

52:44.748 --> 52:49.461
Okay, you guys head
up, you are playing well!

52:49.503 --> 52:53.382
We still have 45 minutes and you
are already thinking about going home.

52:53.423 --> 52:57.261
We go to the World Cup.
We're only losing 2-0.

52:57.302 --> 53:00.389
Only two? only two?
"Defense, defense, defense!"

53:00.430 --> 53:03.517
We can not score goals,
we can not win!

53:03.559 --> 53:05.101
I like that, by
least is talking about

53:05.102 --> 53:06.686
win, everyone will win, we win!

53:06.687 --> 53:09.273
- Somebody tell him that not
I care what he likes.

53:09.398 --> 53:15.028
He's right, while we think it
played the 2nd time, they laugh at us.

53:15.070 --> 53:18.073
You know, it's time to defend.

53:18.115 --> 53:21.243
We took the ball and hold on the
we can not let them score.

53:21.285 --> 53:23.287
So let's go attack
and then won the game.

53:23.328 --> 53:27.498
Gentlemen, are doing well,
but remember,

53:27.499 --> 53:31.670
Lunch tomorrow
12:00 Adolf in Astoria.

53:31.712 --> 53:33.754
Suit and tie.

53:33.755 --> 53:36.382
Officials of FIFA and
American Fed will

53:36.383 --> 53:39.010
be present in the same
so that all of you.

53:39.011 --> 53:42.138
Now, anyone
does not appear to be

53:42.139 --> 53:45.267
off the team, there will be
excuses or exceptions.

53:49.438 --> 53:52.524
Now, to continue what they were doing.

54:21.762 --> 54:24.806
The Americans returned
to his old defense training

54:24.890 --> 54:27.976
trying to prevent more goals to take.
But it was not working.

54:28.018 --> 54:32.147
They seemed to err in
every aspect of the game.

56:39.399 --> 56:42.528
It's a long walk to the hotel, Frank.

56:43.570 --> 56:48.742
I was horrible, they should not
have scored as many goals against me.

56:48.784 --> 56:51.828
It was a failure of the team,
you did not have chances.

56:51.870 --> 56:54.974
It is not the fault of the team, that's my
Walter goal, it is my responsibility!

56:54.998 --> 56:58.126
I am the last line of defense when
score a goal, they score against me.

56:58.168 --> 57:02.296
I who have to catch
the ball in the back of the net.

57:02.297 --> 57:06.509
Perhaps we have made it look easy
tonight, after all none of the players

57:06.510 --> 57:09.637
them is good enough to
go to the England squad,

57:09.638 --> 57:11.932
against whom we play in a week.

57:55.475 --> 58:00.689
Gentlemen, we are grateful for
honor us with your presence today.

58:04.860 --> 58:07.987
You have made a great contribution,

58:07.988 --> 58:11.657
Welcome to the North American continent and

58:11.658 --> 58:15.328
demonstrating the high
English tradition in football.

58:15.329 --> 58:18.999
England, as we all know,

58:19.041 --> 58:21.251
will be our great game.

58:21.877 --> 58:22.961
They were designed,

58:24.755 --> 58:28.759
incubated, and has
are developed.

58:29.426 --> 58:34.056
- What did he say?
- What matters?

58:34.181 --> 58:36.265
There's a player
even that did not feel

58:36.266 --> 58:38.352
honored to be in
field with you yesterday.

58:39.269 --> 58:43.439
I thank you wholeheartedly.

58:43.440 --> 58:46.568
Hey guys, I think our coach
want to go home with the British.

58:46.610 --> 58:51.782
You know what? they can take it.

58:51.823 --> 58:53.199
Pee Wee, take it easy.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.994
You also take it easy,
two for the price of one.

59:05.337 --> 59:09.466
Frank, ensure that it enters
on the plane tomorrow night.

59:09.508 --> 59:14.721
I do not think that talking is enough,
we have to bring it down somehow.

59:19.935 --> 59:26.191
Hey, where is it?

59:26.233 --> 59:31.446
Hey, Voodoo, have someone talking to you.

59:31.488 --> 59:36.618
Can we get some "miki"?

59:36.660 --> 59:41.330
Miki? I get a little with the
guy who is making my passport.

59:41.331 --> 59:44.500
What do you mean by
"Doing your passport?"

59:44.501 --> 59:46.003
I need one, right?

59:46.044 --> 59:48.046
- Yes, you do not already have one?
- No

59:48.088 --> 59:53.302
- You are not naturalized?
- No, I have a student visa.

59:53.343 --> 59:56.430
Learning to be a dishwasher?

59:56.471 --> 01:00:00.601
No, a degree in accounting.

01:00:00.642 --> 01:00:03.562
You've been here enough
to be naturalized, right?

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:04.770
Yes, but...

01:00:04.855 --> 01:00:07.316
It is enough to
me, and for all, right?

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:14.114
Now a few words
a remarkable man.

01:00:14.156 --> 01:00:22.156
Last year, the final
FA Cup, scored three goals.

01:00:22.497 --> 01:00:25.124
A great player, a great man, a

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:29.838
Hero of Our Time,
Mr. Stanley Mortenson.

01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:45.978
The challenge of victory is
close to all our hearts,

01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:49.608
this is why all we are here.

01:00:49.691 --> 01:00:52.777
And these competitions
in international show

01:00:52.778 --> 01:00:55.864
our similarities
and our differences,

01:00:55.906 --> 01:01:01.620
the desire to win at any cost and
the will to pursue these dreams.

01:01:01.662 --> 01:01:07.375
England is not fascinated, for example,
with baseball. We love cricket.

01:01:07.376 --> 01:01:10.462
That fits best
with our national character.

01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:13.631
Just as do with football,

01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:16.760
appears as a single line
be the best way to attack

01:01:16.802 --> 01:01:20.389
Our football fits our
temper the same way.

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.976
It is a sport of intellect as it
as athletic ability

01:01:24.017 --> 01:01:30.274
A sport with strategy, where
predict your opponent is so important

01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:33.360
as running more and score more goals.

01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:38.615
The soccer as you call them,
is in its infancy in North America.

01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:42.827
And take some time to
reach the level of other countries

01:01:42.828 --> 01:01:49.084
where football is a
matter of life or death

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:55.299
But I wish the U.S. team
American lucky

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.469
and after England take you
for school football

01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:05.726
have a nice vacation in Brazil.

01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:08.854
Health

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.366
This guy just say "vacation"?

01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:24.536
- He has more or less this time.
- Do you know where he was?

01:02:24.578 --> 01:02:26.580
- We do not know anything.
- He is not in the back.

01:02:26.622 --> 01:02:30.792
Gloves, Charlie get off the phone.
Have you seen him? found anywhere?

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.837
No sign.

01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:39.092
- I found him, he is on the roof.
- I take it, you take his stuff.

01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:41.136
The bus leaves in 15 minutes.

01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:44.264
- You put my stuff on the bus?
- Yes

01:02:44.306 --> 01:02:48.477
Gloves! Make sure that
buses do not leave without us.

01:02:57.903 --> 01:03:02.074
We have guards at all exits,
can not escape.

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:10.374
So Joe Maca walking there in that alley has
to do with me not flying for the World Cup?

01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:13.502
I guess you know very well.

01:03:17.673 --> 01:03:20.800
The closer we come,
least makes sense

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.885
Why do we have to go
so go there and have

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:24.972
a bunch of murdering the British?

01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:28.141
Frank, what's the purpose?

01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:48.912
This will help you relax.

01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:52.082
- This will not do well for my stomach.
- Drink a sip, Pee Wee.

01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:56.253
- I'm not thirsty.
- Drink now!

01:04:00.424 --> 01:04:02.801
You put something here, Frank?

01:04:04.428 --> 01:04:07.431
No, it's a business voodoo.

01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:12.978
And why do not you say so?

01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:54.603
What are you doing Joe?

01:04:54.645 --> 01:05:00.859
I am in contact with
my spirit guide

01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:07.157
- Voodoo Thing.
- Why do I bother?

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:11.328
It bothers me because it is sacrilege

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:16.583
Sacrilege means something
detracts from their religion,

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:20.337
and what I'm doing is
exactly the opposite.

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:26.927
I do not see Joe as well,
not believe it.

01:05:26.969 --> 01:05:31.138
Why do not you
respect my beliefs?

01:05:31.139 --> 01:05:35.310
They are real to me and
millions of people in my country.

01:05:35.352 --> 01:05:41.567
It's our way of cultural
understand what we see.

01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:44.694
Powerful forces that guide our lives

01:05:44.695 --> 01:05:49.950
I feel very connected with my
world when I am in contact with it.

01:05:54.121 --> 01:05:57.207
What you say is be sacrilege

01:05:57.249 --> 01:06:01.920
something that says that there is
no power in what you believe

01:06:01.962 --> 01:06:06.550
We are together here because
we are good at what they love

01:06:06.592 --> 01:06:09.218
And whoever or it is that put

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:11.805
the ball in the back of the net,
not matter to me.

01:06:23.317 --> 01:06:25.902
Ladies and Gentlemen,
here is Captain Da Silva.

01:06:25.903 --> 01:06:28.530
We are going through
strong turbulence.

01:06:28.572 --> 01:06:30.615
Please keep
tightened their belts.

01:06:30.616 --> 01:06:32.701
We go through it in 30 minutes.

01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:34.786
Thank you.

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:06.026
Where are we?

01:07:06.068 --> 01:07:09.695
In a large crater in the ground.

01:07:09.696 --> 01:07:13.325
Oh, great, into the ground.

01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:02.332
Look at this hotel!

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:10.651
We have bets, England
is favored, 3 to 1.

01:09:10.692 --> 01:09:15.322
Brazil 4 to 1, Italy 1 to 6,
Spain, 8 to 1.

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:20.035
The only team that is not even
we are listed, the United States.

01:09:20.077 --> 01:09:24.706
- As if we did not exist, right?
- As someone not even bet on us?

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:27.332
There are bets for all
games of the first phase,

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:29.920
except for our game with England.

01:09:30.002 --> 01:09:34.091
That's disrespectful.

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:56.029
I'm sorry gentlemen,
got lost somewhere.

01:09:56.071 --> 01:10:00.158
I apologize for not being
with you in New York

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.245
There were many preparations
I had to take care here.

01:10:03.328 --> 01:10:08.458
No need to apologize, at least in
put in class hotels.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.671
- I also apologize for that Charlie.
- And the uniforms, what we wear?

01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:14.715
Are being provided, I'm sure.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:18.926
You are promising that the last two
week and is already in the last minute.

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:22.054
Mr. Parian, is the ability
player and not the

01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:25.184
splendor of its
clothing that matter.

01:10:25.225 --> 01:10:28.352
Tomorrow, Tuesday,
training, I'll find a field,

01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:31.481
somewhere, I'm just
waiting for confirmations.

01:10:31.523 --> 01:10:34.609
Our first game in
fourth against England

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.738
not be in the stadiums
hence the main Rio

01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:42.910
Is a city about 500 km
northeast of here called Belo Horizonte.

01:10:42.951 --> 01:10:48.081
There is a North squad
American, based in Recife,

01:10:48.123 --> 01:10:51.251
that will take us to arrange for
there in Brazilian plane transport.

01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:54.421
- What the hell is this?
- But good!

01:10:55.422 --> 01:11:01.719
Who cares? we are here in Rio
and have the right to have fun.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.806
Whoever wants out tonight?

01:11:04.848 --> 01:11:10.062
You do not know what is fun.
The Pee Wee coach party in 5 minutes.

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:14.233
Walter, we have a meeting tonight.

01:11:15.234 --> 01:11:21.490
You know what? Let's go out tonight.

01:11:21.532 --> 01:11:25.619
All of us will.

01:11:25.661 --> 01:11:29.831
We were together as a team.

01:12:19.923 --> 01:12:22.009
This is beautiful.

01:12:24.094 --> 01:12:29.266
You know, there is much in common
samba, tango and football.

01:12:29.308 --> 01:12:31.310
Like what Joe?

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:39.351
Football is more a group of guys
who sing together in the field.

01:12:42.863 --> 01:12:44.907
What were you saying?

01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:49.745
What I said is that it has much
in common between football and dancing.

01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:57.127
Football is like a bunch of guys
dancing together in the field.

01:12:58.962 --> 01:13:03.467
It's the rhythm of the game, the way
we move with the changes.

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:08.847
Suddenly, we go with the tide.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:14.019
And when the chemistry is there, with each
others, and we can make magic on the field.

01:13:16.104 --> 01:13:18.731
Sure Joe, I understand,
you think we should go

01:13:18.732 --> 01:13:21.318
field with the English
and do the cha-cha?

01:13:25.614 --> 01:13:28.199
So to say that
I do not dance well I do not

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.827
I play good football?
Because I can not dance.

01:14:12.494 --> 01:14:16.665
That is magic Joe, very well.

01:14:37.561 --> 01:14:40.689
Gentlemen, welcome to the base of
Air Force in Rio de Janeiro,

01:14:40.731 --> 01:14:43.734
I'm Lieutenant Austin.
Would you mind leaving?

01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:47.863
Let's take a plane
to Belo Horizonte.

01:14:47.905 --> 01:14:51.074
I understand that if
you can follow me.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.331
- What's going on Frank?
- I do not know, come on.

01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:24.399
Gentlemen, I present
General William Higgins.

01:15:24.441 --> 01:15:29.655
Higgins General, I will give the
football team of the United States.

01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:32.782
Welcome, gentlemen.

01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:35.911
First, they have
say that today, our president

01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:40.082
and commander in chief ordered
that many of our units

01:15:40.123 --> 01:15:44.252
traveling through
Pacific for what

01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:48.423
unfortunately seems to be
a conflict in Korea.

01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:52.636
Gentlemen, is never more important
wear the colors of our nation

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:55.681
than when we are at war.
I'm sure you

01:15:55.722 --> 01:15:59.392
will represent our
country with pride and

01:15:59.393 --> 01:16:03.021
demonstrate the best of
our warrior spirit.

01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:08.234
Win or lose,
and I hope they win.

01:16:08.235 --> 01:16:12.406
We'll all be proud of
you and your efforts tomorrow.

01:16:12.865 --> 01:16:16.034
Just a warning, as
My father used to say.

01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:19.705
Leave everything off the field.

01:16:19.746 --> 01:16:24.960
At the request of the president of the Federation
North-American Football, Walter Giesler.

01:16:25.002 --> 01:16:30.090
And coach William Jeffrey,

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:35.345
would like to show something to the team
you certainly will need tomorrow.

01:16:38.473 --> 01:16:43.186
I understand that the first
will be someone to receive

01:16:43.187 --> 01:16:47.899
I was really
concerned with this item.

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.070
St. Louis, Missouri
Gino Parian, come here!

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.011
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Mr. Parian

01:17:23.352 --> 01:17:27.523
Seaman, Walter Bahr.

01:17:35.864 --> 01:17:37.866
Thank you.

01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:42.079
Seaman, Harry Keough.

01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:51.880
Coast Guard and Sailor
first class, Charlie Colombo.

01:17:57.761 --> 01:18:01.932
The City of New York,
Joseph Gaetjens.

01:18:06.103 --> 01:18:10.274
New York, Joseph Maca.

01:18:12.317 --> 01:18:16.488
Army sergeant, John Sousa,
Massachusetts.

01:18:20.659 --> 01:18:24.830
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Ed Mcllvenny.

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:31.127
Awarded the Star Brown
for bravery in service.

01:18:31.128 --> 01:18:35.299
Army sergeant, Francis Wallace.

01:18:39.469 --> 01:18:43.599
- Very well, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.225
Awarded two
Hearts-of-Silver and two

01:18:46.226 --> 01:18:48.812
Star Brown, sub-sergeant
Army, Frank Borghi.

01:19:04.494 --> 01:19:09.707
Thank you to all the
great job for our country.

01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:12.836
A salute to our team!

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:23.222
Matthews will not play today. He decided
rest in Rio for the next game.

01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:27.392
- Are you taking a vacation?
- I think so.

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:32.606
Finney and Bentley will get the ball more.
Bentley is tall and strong in the air.

01:19:32.648 --> 01:19:35.733
Then observe the side
and the bottom line.

01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:37.151
Finney will get the ball.

01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:39.946
You will be moving to
Mortensen all the time.

01:19:39.947 --> 01:19:43.075
- I take care of it.
- Well, Gloves.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:51.416
We must be patient, we need
be strong and win the ball back.

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:54.043
Gino, Clarkie, you must be free.

01:19:54.044 --> 01:19:55.087
Right.

01:19:55.587 --> 01:19:59.716
- Pee Wee, I need you...
- I'll take care of the right side.

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:02.886
- Right.
- Roger.

01:20:02.928 --> 01:20:05.973
Frank wants to say something?

01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:13.313
I was just thinking, there is no one that
stands who knows who we are.

01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:18.526
Most do not think
should be here.

01:20:18.527 --> 01:20:20.571
But we are here.

01:20:20.612 --> 01:20:26.869
And we're about to go out there
and play with the best team in the world.

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:28.912
Nobody expects anything
from us in the game.

01:20:28.954 --> 01:20:33.624
Nothing, but I think at least we

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:37.254
know that we are worth
a little more than that.

01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:42.466
Not many people had the
chance that we are having today.

01:20:42.467 --> 01:20:46.012
So let's make sure
one thing, that after

01:20:46.013 --> 01:20:49.474
90 minutes they will
know who we are.

01:20:50.851 --> 01:20:57.065
Right?

01:20:57.107 --> 01:21:01.278
- Good game
- Thank you Pee Wee

01:21:03.655 --> 01:21:09.578
Welcome to this great game,
England against the United States.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.791
A large audience here today,
as the teams take the field.

01:21:15.834 --> 01:21:18.461
The Americans
were in front of more

01:21:18.462 --> 01:21:21.048
viewers than they had ever seen.

01:21:21.089 --> 01:21:24.176
38,000 noisy fans in Brazil.

01:21:24.218 --> 01:21:26.802
My hope was they could leave the

01:21:26.803 --> 01:21:29.430
field at the end of the game
with their pride intact.

01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:32.016
And I wonder what
through the mind of this team

01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:34.645
virtually unknown Americans.

01:21:34.686 --> 01:21:37.731
As they heat up in the field.
They will play a leading

01:21:37.773 --> 01:21:41.902
in football, a team
feared wherever you play.

01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:45.613
Let's have fair play, ok?

01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:49.159
- Good Luck!
- Thank you!

01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:52.036
And England will defend
the goal to my right,

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:54.830
or rather, attack
the goal to my left,

01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:57.031
because that is what we are
predicting that will happen.

01:21:57.584 --> 01:22:02.797
Listen, is a gross competition out there
although it is not a war.

01:22:02.798 --> 01:22:07.970
If this were a war,
you'd be dead already.

01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:09.888
It's a very bold to say.

01:22:10.764 --> 01:22:12.182
I'm serious

01:22:16.311 --> 01:22:19.648
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:22:22.568 --> 01:22:27.781
And what kind of magic to England show
in the next 90 minutes? The game started

01:22:27.823 --> 01:22:31.951
and the ball goes straight to Stanley
Mortenson. Stan with the ball.

01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:34.579
And try to steal Gaetjens
the ball. Mortenson to

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.206
Wright, who plays Tom Finnley.

01:22:37.207 --> 01:22:40.335
And England now attacks
the right side of the field,

01:22:40.377 --> 01:22:43.422
testing the U.S. defense.

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:47.091
Flip left
with Mannion, he spends his

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:50.721
marker, go to the line
background and cross for Bentley.

01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:54.850
Bentley kicks.
Defense Frank Borghi!

01:22:54.892 --> 01:22:59.438
Almost a minute of the game and
England almost scored the first goal.

01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:09.489
And again they attack the right.
A rocket Mortenson.

01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:15.746
And he hit the crossbar at the moment
Frank Borghi is holding England

01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:18.915
almost alone! That
sensational performance.

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:22.044
And he hit goal kick
here in Belo Horizonte.

01:23:22.085 --> 01:23:27.216
Still 0-0. England, I think it
expect a goal so far.

01:23:27.257 --> 01:23:31.345
And Colombia to the attack
easily. Here's Wallace...

01:23:31.386 --> 01:23:36.099
attacking from the right side, is the first
Since the United States will attack.

01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:40.770
Aston stop the bid. Here comes England
again with Finney. Finney for Mannion.

01:23:40.771 --> 01:23:44.982
Mannion kicks. Great
defense of Frank Borghi!

01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:49.154
Plunging toward the ball.
What a great match for him.

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:51.739
What inspiration he is
having. He and his companions

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.368
begin to gain strength from his example.

01:23:54.409 --> 01:23:58.539
They seem to show signs of life.
And start to attack more aggressively.

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.625
Great pass from Harry Keough.
Gaetjens Ball for the strong Gaetjens

01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:05.754
spins, kicks and open space!
High, high.

01:24:05.796 --> 01:24:12.051
Not very pretty, but did
the audience stood up.

01:24:12.052 --> 01:24:16.223
Lack of Dickenson. The public did not
like and American players do not.

01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:19.351
Charlie Colombo
argues with the referee.

01:24:19.393 --> 01:24:23.021
I wonder if the Americans lose
Now the head and concentration.

01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:26.692
And they seem to be concentrated in other
Finney thing and gets behind your back.

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:30.821
Finney on the bottom line, crosses.
Defended!

01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:34.950
We must attack now!
We have to attack!

01:24:34.992 --> 01:24:38.120
If you keep kicking Benley
and not the ball, will be helping them.

01:24:38.161 --> 01:24:41.206
I do not help anyone.

01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:45.418
Frank Borghi kicks. And
England creates a further attack by

01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:49.590
tries to turn right while
their supremacy into goals.

01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:54.844
A great chance for England.
Mortenson now, and he kicks...

01:24:54.845 --> 01:25:00.017
out.
Mortenson hardly believe.

01:25:00.058 --> 01:25:05.230
The sides are still closed.
But then comes back to England

01:25:05.272 --> 01:25:08.900
as a blue wave.
Mortenson again, turns,

01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:12.529
open space and kicks. Great
defense of Frank Borghi!

01:25:12.571 --> 01:25:18.285
Roll the ball now for Mcllvenny.
Mcllvenny search for Eddie Souza.

01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:26.125
Mcllvenny comes to hitting the side.
The Americans then doing well

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:29.213
and now is their chance
to establish control.

01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:34.468
The defender is beaten to the captain
Walter Bahr. He had seen the play...

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:39.681
And that goal!
The United States takes the lead.

01:25:53.612 --> 01:25:57.366
A great pass from Bahr
to Gaetjens butt.

01:26:04.706 --> 01:26:06.791
The England players look at each

01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:08.877
others trying to understand
what went wrong.

01:26:08.919 --> 01:26:13.048
The American players
jump on top of each other.

01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:16.175
Put on the head. We
just wake them up.

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:18.262
They going to come up
with everything, Pee Wee.

01:26:18.303 --> 01:26:22.349
The stadium goes wild,
and it is no surprise,

01:26:22.391 --> 01:26:25.518
because over 8 minutes to the end

01:26:25.519 --> 01:26:28.647
the 1st time, the score
England is 0, USA 1.

01:26:28.689 --> 01:26:34.903
Here comes the new England outlining
a reaction strikes again, with Mortenson.

01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:38.031
Defended.

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:42.202
Crossing to Mortenson and
yet another defense of Borghi!

01:26:42.244 --> 01:26:47.416
Mortenson and can not score a goal
to England when they need it.

01:26:47.457 --> 01:26:50.042
And England will have to
wait for the 2nd time

01:26:50.043 --> 01:26:52.671
find a way to Frank Borghi pass.

01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:54.715
Great job. More than 45 minutes.

01:27:07.227 --> 01:27:10.397
I would rather your time guys.

01:27:14.568 --> 01:27:20.282
Can you imagine what the coach
them are now saying in the locker room.

01:27:20.324 --> 01:27:26.037
You just wake up a fierce lion,
and he will be furious as ever.

01:27:26.038 --> 01:27:31.250
And in that second half will want to
crush you like a hammer.

01:27:31.251 --> 01:27:39.251
At the end of that game will be decided by
two things, character and endurance.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.850
The first time you showed
them to have character.

01:27:46.892 --> 01:27:53.148
In this second half will show you
them that you have resistance.

01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:57.319
Good game guys. Enjoy.

01:27:58.445 --> 01:28:02.615
There are still 45 minutes to
England change the course of the game.

01:28:02.616 --> 01:28:06.827
Oranges in the England dressing room
probably had a bitter taste, but

01:28:06.828 --> 01:28:11.500
is coming to England again in the attack.
Finney crosses looking for Hughes.

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:16.171
Disarmed by the American defense.
A goal kick is beaten by Frank Borghi.

01:28:16.588 --> 01:28:18.756
It was clear that the Americans

01:28:18.757 --> 01:28:22.469
entered the field in 2nd half
believing they can win.

01:28:22.511 --> 01:28:26.598
The British knew that the fans
home would be disappointed

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.685
if they do not return as
world champions.

01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:33.897
But losing to the Americans,
it was unimaginable.

01:28:41.238 --> 01:28:47.493
Here comes Mannion of England, passes
through two Americans, plays for Bentley.

01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:52.666
And it kicks!
And hit the woodwork again!

01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:55.794
Frank Borghi now organizing
the U.S. defense.

01:28:55.836 --> 01:28:59.463
They still holding England.

01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:03.051
Still keeping the faith
his heroic effort.

01:29:03.093 --> 01:29:07.263
England again, kick Finney.

01:29:07.264 --> 01:29:11.435
You have to do better than
Frank Borghi to hit it.

01:29:11.476 --> 01:29:15.606
England again. Come with
John, of Manchester United.

01:29:15.647 --> 01:29:19.776
Forward again by
U.S. defense

01:29:19.818 --> 01:29:22.945
Frustration for attack
English, because the defense

01:29:22.946 --> 01:29:26.074
strip the ball. But only
temporarily because

01:29:26.116 --> 01:29:30.245
Mannion is coming, and it crosses Frank
Borghi is pushed by Mortenson.

01:29:30.329 --> 01:29:33.956
Americans are
crazy, Colombo pushes

01:29:33.957 --> 01:29:37.628
Mortenson to the ground.
They still held firm.

01:29:38.545 --> 01:29:44.051
And the Americans fight
aggression through his football.

01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:49.473
1-0 to the USA. An amazing score
one could imagine.

01:29:49.515 --> 01:29:51.849
And the Americans
try to do the latter.

01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:54.227
Gaetjens now, back to Wallace.

01:29:54.228 --> 01:29:59.441
Wallace and goes back to play
Gaetjens. Now with John Souza.

01:29:59.483 --> 01:30:02.528
Kick! Kick!

01:30:02.569 --> 01:30:08.742
Chute de Souza.
And stop the steady hands of Bert Williams.

01:30:08.784 --> 01:30:13.956
Here come the United States again,
this time with Gino Parian.

01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:17.124
Coming from the left side,
it is marked by Hughs,

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:20.254
Liverpool, he dribbles and
goes to the bottom line.

01:30:20.295 --> 01:30:24.465
Hughes and stops the play,
corner for America.

01:30:24.466 --> 01:30:28.636
Everyone waits for the beat of the corner.

01:30:28.637 --> 01:30:32.808
There has been searching for and Gaetjens
Eddie Souza face of the beam.

01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:37.980
And England is almost
losing by two goals.

01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:43.193
Mannion with a cross kick.
And he returns the ball to Frank Borghi.

01:30:43.277 --> 01:30:48.365
And the American team is showing
a great performance in the defense

01:30:48.407 --> 01:30:50.491
Will they keep the game as well?

01:30:50.492 --> 01:30:52.536
England Expects
that the U.S. will fail.

01:30:52.578 --> 01:30:56.747
Still looking for a draw
with Mortenson. And it kicks!

01:30:56.748 --> 01:31:00.960
In the beam and the Americans were
to move close together.

01:31:00.961 --> 01:31:02.546
Benley kicks it up!

01:31:05.924 --> 01:31:08.259
Americans look to the ground

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:10.845
desperate to
hear the final whistle

01:31:10.846 --> 01:31:13.473
but there still to do, here comes
England once more.

01:31:13.515 --> 01:31:17.101
England on the attack,
Borghi organizes the defense.

01:31:17.102 --> 01:31:20.021
Cross from the left, he receives

01:31:20.022 --> 01:31:22.941
Finney plays for.
Finney gives a weak kick

01:31:23.025 --> 01:31:25.110
And Charlie Colombo takes the ball.

01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:27.988
They are the English who have
lions on the shirts,

01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:31.158
but the Americans are
fought for every ball like lions.

01:31:31.783 --> 01:31:34.912
Here comes Finney, and he is knocked down
almost in line with the large area.

01:31:35.037 --> 01:31:38.998
Great tackling from Charlie Colombo.

01:31:38.999 --> 01:31:42.920
He is a
Colombo this personality.

01:31:42.961 --> 01:31:46.381
And England won a corner.

01:31:48.467 --> 01:31:49.927
Hits the corner, left foot.

01:31:55.474 --> 01:32:00.646
Defense Frank Borghi!
32 minutes into the second half.

01:32:00.687 --> 01:32:06.401
Here they come again with Mannion.
Plays for Biegn, which passes to Branty,

01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:10.030
that returns to Mannion. A
big step for Mortenson.

01:32:10.239 --> 01:32:11.907
It can be a goal.

01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:14.201
What a defense!

01:32:20.457 --> 01:32:23.626
The Americans run
to greet their hero.

01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:25.838
Frank Borghi left
the whole audience standing.

01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:34.012
England begins to wonder if
be able to find a way

01:32:34.054 --> 01:32:36.138
to go through this magnificent goalkeeper.

01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:39.518
But they try more
Once again, Bentley is coming...

01:32:40.811 --> 01:32:42.896
And he hits the part
above the crossbar.

01:32:44.481 --> 01:32:48.610
Time is running out of England,
the referee just look at the clock.

01:32:48.652 --> 01:32:52.823
A second seems like an eternity
for Americans.

01:32:52.865 --> 01:32:56.951
Here comes the left Mortenson,
and was an easy defense

01:32:56.952 --> 01:33:02.165
Frank Borghi. And desperation
is the face of the legendary player.

01:33:02.207 --> 01:33:06.335
Everyone on the attack now
to England.

01:33:06.336 --> 01:33:10.507
All the waiting Finney crossing.

01:33:10.549 --> 01:33:13.677
Here comes the crossing can be
last chance for the British.

01:33:27.232 --> 01:33:29.443
And the referee blows...

01:33:31.278 --> 01:33:33.155
the end of the match.

01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:48.045
And suddenly was over.

01:33:48.086 --> 01:33:52.174
Something that I thought
could never happen.

01:33:52.216 --> 01:33:55.885
I thought, who would
believe that,

01:33:55.886 --> 01:33:59.515
whether in England or
in the United States?

01:33:59.556 --> 01:34:02.643
If I had not seen it with my
own eyes I would not believe.

01:34:02.684 --> 01:34:06.812
The country that gave the game
football to the world

01:34:06.813 --> 01:34:12.069
received the biggest shock
the history of world football.

01:34:15.197 --> 01:34:18.283
It was difficult to continue as a reporter.

01:34:18.325 --> 01:34:23.539
I wanted to run into
field along with the Brazilians.

01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:01.034
This was simply the greatest
accomplishment achieved by any team

01:35:01.118 --> 01:35:04.121
in any sport I've ever seen.

01:35:04.162 --> 01:35:06.247
It is an honor to present members

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:08.333
the football team
United States, 1950

01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:10.459
who participated in that
which was considered

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.503
the most Zebra history
the World Cups

01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:14.506
when they defeated
England by 1-0.

01:35:14.548 --> 01:35:16.257
Standing in the middle of the field are:

01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:17.843
Gino Parian,

01:35:20.888 --> 01:35:22.431
John "Clarkie" Sousa,

01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:29.855
Harry Keough,

01:35:34.818 --> 01:35:36.403
Walter Bahr

01:35:40.574 --> 01:35:42.117
and Frank Borghi
