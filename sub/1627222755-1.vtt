02:42.287 --> 02:44.121
- (honks)
- David.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.213
Hey.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.508
Hey. Are you ready?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.260
Yeah. Hey, you can put your stuff
in the back.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.346
Okay. But first...

03:00.514 --> 03:03.099
- I need to show you something.
- What? No, we gotta go.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.435
Naomi and Brice are, like, five minutes
away, so come on, get out of the car.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.980
- Okay.
- Come on.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.606
Okay.
(chuckles)

03:14.403 --> 03:16.487
- All right, get up. Get up here.
- What?

03:16.655 --> 03:18.948
Yeah. Okay.
Ahem...

03:19.116 --> 03:23.911
I know that finishing
this semester at LSU

03:24.079 --> 03:27.081
is really, like, all we've been
thinking about lately.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.333
But I just want you to know

03:29.501 --> 03:31.794
that I still think of you a lot too.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.338
And, actually,

03:34.506 --> 03:38.217
just the other day
I was out and...

03:39.595 --> 03:42.013
I got this.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.892
It's... it's a promise ring.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.396
And I don't think we're ready
for an engagement just yet,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.773
but I just want you to know
how I feel.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.777
And when I bought it,
I wanted to give it to you

03:56.945 --> 03:59.572
while we watched the sunrise

03:59.740 --> 04:02.325
and say something cool
or special,

04:02.492 --> 04:04.535
but I can't really think of anything
cool or special.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.704
Now I'm just kind of
feeling cheesy.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.750
I just want you to know
that I love you

04:10.918 --> 04:14.003
and I'm gonna be there for you
no matter what, I promise.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.922
You're too good for me.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.923
You really are. You are.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.300
- (horn honking)
- Naomi: Taylor! Whoo!

04:19.468 --> 04:21.636
Oh, here they come.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.888
Let's go.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.182
- (rap music playing)
- Naomi: I'm pretty sure.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.100
- Brice: All right, all right.
- But I don't know.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.310
- You don't?
- No.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.228
- Do you even know how to work this?
- Of course I do.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.941
Killer. Look at you,
learning how to work your mama's car.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.985
Okay, okay.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.612
Stop it. Stop it. Brice.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.865
Don't look like you don't enjoy being
a girlfriend of a future NFL superstar.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.451
Okay, big head.
If that head gets any bigger,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.745
I'm strapping you
to their Jeep.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.622
- (horn honks)
- Taylor: Get a room.

04:51.249 --> 04:55.086
- What's up, man?
- We're already late. Come on, crazy.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.088
(car lock chirps)

04:57.255 --> 04:59.298
- You hear that, man?
- David: About time you got here.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.425
Mwah. Mwah.

05:01.593 --> 05:05.137
Oh, I'm so ready for this trip,
it's not even funny.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.681
Are you ready to have fun?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.599
- Am I ready to have fun?
- That's what I asked you.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.518
- Are you ready to have fun?
- Well, I know I'm ready to have fun.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.645
I was just making sure you were
ready to have fun.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.398
I am the king of fun.
Of course I'm ready.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.275
Oh, my gosh.
Big head, just come get in the car.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.694
Jeez.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.570
Naomi:
You see what I deal with?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.739
Did you guys see this?
All the time.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.582
Naomi: Whoo!
Yeah, let’s go! Vacation!

05:39.756 --> 05:41.298

06:37.856 --> 06:39.440
Where's y'all's car?
I didn't see it.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.025
Oh, it's in the shop this weekend.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.526
We're just gonna use yours
if we need one.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.237
- Oh, okay.
- Howard: Well, you decided to show up.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.781
Taylor: Hi.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.575
Oh, my God, Sharley,
this place is so beautiful.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.619
Howard:
Yeah, it ought to be.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.996
It's my dad's favorite summer home
he never lets anyone stay at.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.664
So "vous etre si chez voix."

06:55.832 --> 06:58.542
- "Chez vous," baby, "chez vous."
- Oh, I love when you correct me, baby.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.670
Or as they say in Mexican,
"mi casa, su casa."

07:01.838 --> 07:03.547
- All right.
- Just stop. Help them with their bags.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.382
- Naomi: Hi.
- Guys, enjoy these moments right now,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.635
- because in a few years...
- Naomi: Cute dress.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.678
...it's gonna be all work,
no play.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.222
- Naomi: Come on.
- Howard: Yeah, that's right,

07:11.389 --> 07:13.432
'cause in a few years
when y'all are busting your asses,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.893
I'm gonna be sailing the coast of Bali
with my dad's life insurance check

07:16.061 --> 07:18.062
- in my motherfucking account.
- Sharley: Howard.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.563
- Baby, I'm just joking.
- Brice: Oh, man.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.273
Taylor: Shar, you have
a radio here, right?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.067
Sharley: No, hon', you're just
gonna have to deal.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.402
Get used to no cell service, guys.
It's basically nonexistent

07:25.570 --> 07:28.072
- till my dad has a tower built.
- Wait, wait, dude, are you serious?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.324
I got a whole bunch of calls
I gotta make about my internship.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.409
And plus, what if somebody
breaks their leg or something?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.829
Oh, if there's an emergency,
there's a landline in the kitchen.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.914
And if you're a total pussy,
you can walk a half a mile

07:37.082 --> 07:39.166
to Mr. Bromlin's house
and get reception there.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.044
Well, you know what? It actually feels
kind of good not having my cell phone.

07:42.212 --> 07:45.131
Agreed. It gives us time
to actually talk instead of texting.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.841
- Does that feel good, you guys?
- Feels good.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.636
Feels good? Now this circle jerk
is over, let me show you to your rooms.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.180
Bricey, since you are
just so damn sexy,

07:53.348 --> 07:55.057
you get the first master bedroom.
It is badass.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.809
- David, there's your room.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.811
Fucking jackass,
I've got my laptop in there.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.312
- What, is that your bag?
- Yeah.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.148
- Dude, I thought that was Taylor's.
- No, man.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.984
Something wrong with you, boy.
Now me and the lady...

08:05.152 --> 08:07.611
me and the lady are gonna take
the other master bedroom

08:07.779 --> 08:10.739
where we will make
sweet, passionate love.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.160
Unless, of course, you guys... you know,
you want to switch it up a bit

08:14.327 --> 08:15.995
and the dudes can take
this bedroom here

08:16.163 --> 08:18.122
while me and the ladies
take the other one.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.332
- What?
- Stop it.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.459
- Is that bad?
- That's enough.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.919
Baby. Wow.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.588
Ladies, you want to go
check out the back yard?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.631
- Sure.
- How is this not a j...? Look, baby,

08:27.799 --> 08:29.341
oh, this is... only in pretend

08:29.509 --> 08:31.927
would you and your friends
sleep with me in the same bed.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.636
- Huh?
- Grow up.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.222
- Yeah? Unless you want to.
- Bye.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.932
- Would you just think about it?
- (door opens)

08:37.100 --> 08:39.476
Oh, I love you too, baby,
light of my life.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.645

08:47.986 --> 08:49.361

11:06.624 --> 11:08.834

Mr. Newbuck: Howard?
Howard, are you there?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.390
Yeah, Pop.
What's going on?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.309
Howard, I'm still in New York.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.436
There's been some kind
of terrorist attack.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.857
They're saying ballistic missiles
are headed toward the Gulf Coast.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.026
- And the military is...
- (static crackling)

11:34.194 --> 11:37.780
attempting to intercept...
my way... pick up your mom...

11:37.947 --> 11:40.824
Dad? Hello?

11:42.952 --> 11:45.621
Look, let me try back again
from the other phone.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.706
Oh, my God,
I have to call my mom.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.541
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead
and go call my dad.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.877
I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
We just need to calm down.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.837
Yeah, we don't even know
where the missile's headed.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.006
You guys, we have to
pack our stuff and get out of here.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.925
Baby, baby, hold on. No, no.
I just talked to my dad.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.511
He said that the safest place to be
during an attack is in a rural area.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.429
So we should just stay here,
wait for the military

12:02.597 --> 12:04.848
- to launch its antideployment, okay?
- David: That makes a lot of sense.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.809
Rural means fewer people.
It will be less of an impact.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.104
So theoretically the worst place to be
would be a city like New Orleans, right?

12:10.271 --> 12:12.398
Shit. My brother
is in New Orleans.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.775
Baby, he's in the military, though.
He'll be fine.

12:14.943 --> 12:18.320
- Why New Orleans?
- Yeah, guys, honestly, my vote is

12:18.488 --> 12:20.406
let's just stay here,
let them blow that shit out of the sky

12:20.573 --> 12:22.366
- and continue having a good time.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

12:22.534 --> 12:25.577
- Yeah, and who said we were voting?
- David: Guys, that's not a bad idea.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.538
We only have one car here.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.498
We should probably decide
what to do as a group.

12:29.666 --> 12:33.168
All right, all in favor of staying here,
raise your hand.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.259
All right, and all in favor
of leaving?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.265
Taylor, you have to vote.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.017
I don't have enough data
to make an educated decision.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.228
You don't have enough data?
This isn't a science class.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.522
We need to vote right now,
'cause we have to decide what to do.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.190
- I'm not voting.
- Okay, fine.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.609
Three against two, though.
We're staying.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.820
- Fine.
- Babe. Babe...?

12:59.988 --> 13:03.282
- (David sighs)
- Naomi: Jesus, this is so crazy.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.123
I wish we could at least find out
which way the missiles are headed.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.208
I know. Me too.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.376
(Howard belches)

13:14.544 --> 13:16.253
I told my dad
not to get rid of the fucking TV.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.464
Actually it wouldn't matter
if we had a TV.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.799
Ballistic missiles
are radio-controlled.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.719
They change directions at any time,
so the military...

13:23.887 --> 13:27.055
they wouldn't even know
where they're headed.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.640
What?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.809
My brother's Recon
and he's a weapons freak.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.520
I'm gonna get some air.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.734
(chimes jingling)

13:43.156 --> 13:45.157
(sighs)

14:00.131 --> 14:01.840
(loud whizzing)

14:02.008 --> 14:04.009
(gasps)

14:07.222 --> 14:09.681
- (explosion)
- Oh, my...

14:09.849 --> 14:11.767
- Naomi: Oh, my God.
- David: What was that?

14:11.935 --> 14:14.478
- Naomi: That's not good.
- Sharley: What was that?

14:14.646 --> 14:16.021
Sharley:
Look at that.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.482
Naomi:
What? Oh, my God.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.529
Howard:
Shit.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.699
Did you see it?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.868
I saw everything.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.371
Naomi: Oh, my God,
what is that?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.835
- Sharley: Okay, Mom, I love you.
- Naomi: I don't know.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.881
- I've never seen them so scared.
- Woman: You take care, Sharley.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.302
My mom says
that it's all over the news

14:47.470 --> 14:49.638
that one of the missiles
was shot down by fighter jets

14:49.806 --> 14:52.808
and the other one self-exploded
in the sky over New Orleans.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.895
See? What did I tell you, huh?
I knew they'd blow that shit up.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.274
No, no, that's not true. Those jets
didn't do anything to that missile.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.860
It was probably just like a mistake
in the reporting or something, babe.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.122
(exhales)

15:15.290 --> 15:17.708
This shit's crazy, man.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.209
Hmm.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.714
I'm gonna marry that girl.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.716
Yeah, you should.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.176
That way my best friend
can be my lawyer

15:28.344 --> 15:30.095
and his girl can be my doctor.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.514
Dude, she's not gonna be that kind
of doctor. I told you that.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.558
Dude, get her
to change her mind.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.727
There's way more money
in sports medicine.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.855
I told you, dude,
she wants to save the world

15:40.023 --> 15:41.773
and cure diseases.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.567
And besides, isn't Naomi
gonna be a doctor?

15:43.735 --> 15:46.820
- Don't you plan on having her around?
- Man, she's gonna be a dentist,

15:46.988 --> 15:48.947
and God knows when.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.283
Well, be thankful you have her, man.
She's a great girl.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.535
Yeah, I am.

15:55.038 --> 15:58.123
Dude, this whole thing
has really got me thinking, you know,

15:58.291 --> 16:00.208
about, like, life.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.796
You know, and it's not about
us graduating or...

16:04.964 --> 16:08.717
or me starting my own law firm or
you being the first pick in the draft.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.595
It's about having a drink
with my best friend.

16:11.763 --> 16:15.682
- Yeah.
- Or going to dinner with my girlfriend.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.977
I want to start enjoying those moments
that I have right now.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.438
And then one day
I want to sit back

16:21.606 --> 16:23.815
and I want to watch
our kids play together.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.776
And I want to enjoy
those moments too.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.987
Wow.
That was really deep, man.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.323
Dude, but you know
how I get sometimes.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.534
Tomorrow isn't promised.
That missile could have hit anywhere.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.828
And it didn't.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.873
I mean,
and we're alive right now.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.586
Sharley:
I think I'm in love, Taylor.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.463
Oh, my God. With Howard?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.341
- Yeah.
- Okay, don't get me wrong.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.551
I think he's really cool,

16:51.719 --> 16:55.180
but he just seems like
a wild and crazy boy.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.224
(both laugh)

16:57.392 --> 16:58.809
Yeah, he is.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.311
But that's just when he's
around everybody else.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.021
When it's just the two of us,
he's really sweet.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.108
And plus, I know he's gonna be
a great guy someday.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.529
And he speaks
three languages.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.656
And he's funny.
And he's smart.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.450
- And he's pompous.
- Oh, come on.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.869
You know,
I'm not perfect either.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.705
So we can grow together.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.792
Weren't you the one who told me
that he was afraid of commitment?

17:24.961 --> 17:27.045
Okay, come on,
stop giving me a hard time.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.256
The reason I'm telling you this
is because after school

17:29.424 --> 17:31.258
we plan on moving in
together.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.801
Oh, really?

17:32.969 --> 17:35.887
I've just never met anybody
who makes me feel the way he does.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.351
So how about you and David?

17:41.519 --> 17:44.396
David is...
he's a really great guy.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.398
But?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.568
But sometimes I feel

17:49.736 --> 17:52.571
smothered in his protection

17:52.739 --> 17:55.323
and perfectness.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.743
And he...

17:57.910 --> 17:59.911
he gave me a ring.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.371
An engagement ring?

18:01.539 --> 18:03.081
No, no, no, no. God, no.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.916
No, a...

18:05.084 --> 18:06.752
Oh, cute.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.921
A promise ring. I know.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.926
Now... now what do I say
after that?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.221
(growling)

18:22.018 --> 18:23.894
Look at that dog.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.520
What's he doing?

18:25.688 --> 18:27.814
- (growling)
- (door opens)

18:29.066 --> 18:32.027
What the...? What?

18:32.195 --> 18:35.447
- David: Nice dinners, a lot of sun.
- Sharley: Guys, come over here.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.616
- Brice: And a lot of sex.
- Sharley: There's a dog.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.162
What the fuck is that?

18:42.330 --> 18:43.789
- Brice: Okay, who brought the dog?
- (door opens)

18:43.956 --> 18:46.541
(growling)

18:53.883 --> 18:56.259
- What the...?
- Stay back.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.978
(all screaming)

19:07.146 --> 19:10.106
Taylor: Get inside. Close the door.
Close the door. Close the door.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.778
- Oh, my God.
- Shut the fuck up.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.781
(clock chiming)

19:17.949 --> 19:19.616
Shh.

19:26.624 --> 19:27.999
- (barking)
- (all scream)

19:28.167 --> 19:30.168
Hey, guys, what's going on?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.170
- It's a fucking dog, dude.
- A fucking dog?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.840
It's not just a fucking dog.
He's got, like, rabies or something.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.133
- All: Whoa. Don't open the door.
- What? I was just gonna look.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.677
Oh, my God.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.932
Okay. Okay.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.101
Guys, it's getting dark

19:46.269 --> 19:49.104
and apparently we have a crazed dog
stalking the premises,

19:49.272 --> 19:51.147
so why don't we just lock up the fort
and call it a night?

19:51.315 --> 19:52.399
- Women: Yeah.
- Okay?

19:54.485 --> 19:56.862
Yeah, so it is,

19:57.029 --> 19:59.030
yeah, right here.

20:00.950 --> 20:05.328
There they are.
Do you have pillowcases?

20:05.496 --> 20:08.540
Yeah. You know what?
They should be on the bottom shelf.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.166
- Bottom?
- Mm-hmm.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.710
All right.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.588
- Um...
- Mm-hmm.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.047
I don't see any.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.717
They're there.
Look... look all the way back.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.885
- All the way.
- Up here?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.386
Mm-hmm, yeah.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.055
You know what?
They're under the pillow.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.725
Of course.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.811
Here they are.
I need a...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.939
- What are you doing?
- Wow.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.025
Wowee, you have amazing skin.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.986
- Have I ever told you that?
- Naomi: Are you crazy?

20:38.154 --> 20:40.363
Why is everybody
always asking me that?

20:40.531 --> 20:42.240
I'm just trying to have
a little fun.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.075
Seriously, Howard,
do you realize

20:44.243 --> 20:45.785
how inappropriate
your behavior is right now?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.370
Howard:
What are you talking about?

20:47.538 --> 20:49.789
(sighs)
God.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.293
- Want to punish me?
- You know what? Fuck you.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.254
(door slams)

20:56.422 --> 20:58.757
(dog growling)

21:04.972 --> 21:08.099
(growling continues)

21:08.267 --> 21:10.894
(rattling)

21:18.694 --> 21:21.529
Baby, do you hear that?

21:21.697 --> 21:23.073
- David.
- Hmm?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.491
Do you hear that?

21:24.659 --> 21:26.618
It was nothing, babe.
Go back to sleep.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.870
- (dog growling)
- (sharp bang)

21:34.919 --> 21:37.170
(growling continues)

21:42.385 --> 21:44.427
(birds chirping)

21:44.595 --> 21:46.262
(chimes tinkling)

21:52.770 --> 21:54.145
(both chuckle)

21:54.313 --> 21:57.190
Naomi: Thank you.
So what's up for today?

21:57.358 --> 21:58.984
You want to go swimming
or what?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.986
Brice:
Sure, I'm up for that.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.699
Naomi: I'm glad we're finally here.
It's so beautiful.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.701
Thanks for breakfast.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.328
- What?
- What the fuck?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.955
(growling)

22:12.123 --> 22:17.127
Oh, my God.
It looks scarier than before.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.923
All right, fuck it.
That's it.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.758
Wait.

22:28.222 --> 22:31.099
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna put him out of his misery.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.643
Brice, no.
I have a really bad feeling about this.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.979
Hey, please don't go out.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.648
David, wake up.
Brice is trying to go outside

22:38.816 --> 22:40.483
and that dog from last night
is still out there, you guys.

22:40.651 --> 22:44.696
Please get up.
Hurry.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.490
Howard: Oh, really?
The stupid dog again?

22:49.410 --> 22:53.538
Dude, come on.
I got a bat. You want that?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.832
- Yeah, let me get that.
- All right.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.877
I don't know about this.
Maybe we don't do this and call...

22:59.045 --> 23:01.046
- Animal Control.
- Yeah, Animal Control.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.468
Brice.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.471
I just want you to know
I think that this is completely stupid.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.182
All right.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.350
- (growling)
- (flies buzzing)

23:14.518 --> 23:16.853
(chimes tinkling)

23:37.374 --> 23:38.958
Naomi:
Brice, don't!

23:39.126 --> 23:40.168
(snarling)

23:42.046 --> 23:43.671
Whoa.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.174
Brice!

23:46.342 --> 23:48.301
- (dull thud)
- Oh, shit.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.141
(flies buzzing)

23:58.479 --> 24:00.522
Oh, shit.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.068
My dad's gonna blame me
for that shit.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.903
I think I broke his neck.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.863
Good. I hope it hurt like shit,
you little fuck.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.741
- Don't say that. He was probably sick.
- You see what he did to my stairs?

24:11.909 --> 24:14.369
All right, the show's over, guys.
Let's throw this dude in the trash can.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.621
What? No. We're not gonna
throw him in the trash, dude.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.123
What if this was your dog?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.835
- (snarls)
- (all yelp)

24:22.002 --> 24:23.461
(dog squeals)

24:23.629 --> 24:25.547
(Howard grunts)
Ugh!

24:31.887 --> 24:33.805
Oh.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.146
There's an address on here,
but no phone number.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.565
Now I'll just drive it into town

24:43.732 --> 24:45.567
and take it to Animal Control
or something.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.485
Do you have any plastic?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.946
- Yeah. Hang on.
- Brice: Oh, my God.

24:50.114 --> 24:53.032
- I knew I heard something last night.
- David: I'm so sorry.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.411
(door closes)

24:56.579 --> 24:58.163
That was horrible.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.957
Brice, do you mind if I borrow
Naomi for a minute?

25:01.125 --> 25:02.500
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.502
Girl stuff. You wouldn't want
to be bored.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.630
- I'll be right up.
- All right, baby.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.841
Hey, what's up?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.593
What's going on?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.970
- With what?
- With you and Howard.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.763
Me and Howard?
What are you talking about?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.348
Oh, don't act dumb.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.434
I stood here last night
and heard you guys upstairs.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.728
And he's been acting really weird
since yesterday.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.272
Sharley, there's nothing
going on with us.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.734
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

25:27.902 --> 25:29.777
um, I'm just gonna go.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.654
No, please stay.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.407
I think you've heard
most of it already anyway.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.451
So what's going on?

25:36.619 --> 25:39.746
Okay, you guys, let's just go outside.
We'll talk about this in private.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.248
Okay.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.461
Man on radio:
And as reported earlier, the hospitals

25:46.629 --> 25:49.464
are filling up with patients
with a kind of unusual infection.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.133
The symptoms are vomiting of blood,
lack of muscle control.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.261
WZME advises all listeners
to stay indoors,

25:55.429 --> 25:57.096
keeping all dogs and cats
on leashes,

25:57.264 --> 26:00.642
and reminding you
to have a nice day.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.685
Taylor: Just tell us
what happened.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.191
It happened
at the Sigma party.

26:08.359 --> 26:12.528
Honestly, Sharley,
I didn't mean for it to happen.

26:12.696 --> 26:16.658
I was really drunk
and he basically took advantage of me.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.034
Whoa, did he force
himself on you?

26:18.202 --> 26:20.161
No, no, it's not exactly
what I'm trying to say, but...

26:20.329 --> 26:21.871
What are you saying?

26:26.543 --> 26:29.545
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.839
Oh, stop it.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.384
You disgust me, both of you.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.594
And for months you pretend?

26:36.762 --> 26:38.680
(sniffling)

26:38.847 --> 26:40.265
Fuck you.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.892
You're calling yourself my friend
and fucking my boyfriend.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.770
And fuck him
for being the liar that he is.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.691
He probably just wanted
to come here and see you.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.735
Sharley, please listen to me.
Do not tell Brice.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.737
I'm begging you.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.990
Please let me talk to him first.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.995
Don't you dare say another word
to me all day, you hear me?

27:06.083 --> 27:08.376
(radio beeping)

27:10.921 --> 27:12.547
Recording on radio:
This is not a test.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.216
This is a parish-wide
emergency broadcast

27:15.384 --> 27:17.802
from the Louisiana
Emergency System.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.097
There has been
a biological weapon attack.

27:21.265 --> 27:25.435
The following areas of Baton Rouge
Parish have been quarantined...

27:25.602 --> 27:29.772
Springfield, Hammond.
Please stay in your homes.

27:29.940 --> 27:33.192
Lock your doors.
Do not venture outside.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.112
- What the fuck?
- (radio beeping)

27:37.448 --> 27:39.449
(recording continues)
This is not a test.

27:39.616 --> 27:42.118
This is a parish-wide
emergency broadcast

27:42.286 --> 27:44.620
from the Louisiana
Emergency System.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.957
There has been
a biological weapon attack.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.209
The following areas...

27:53.630 --> 27:56.382
- Ma'am?
- Recording: Please stay in your homes.

27:56.550 --> 28:00.136
Lock your doors.
Do not venture outside.

28:03.057 --> 28:05.641
Excuse me, ma'am,
are you all right?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.769
(snarling)

28:23.410 --> 28:26.162
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.333
(David panting)

28:31.627 --> 28:33.252
(tires screeching)

28:33.420 --> 28:34.837
Get off, get off, get off!

28:36.340 --> 28:37.507
(David yelping)

28:48.769 --> 28:51.145
Guys, guys!

28:55.025 --> 28:57.193
Guys, guys!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

28:57.361 --> 28:58.361
Howard:
Yeah, we're in here.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.363
- Guys, where are you?
- Taylor: Whoa. What's going on?

29:00.531 --> 29:02.156
Guys, pack your shit.
We are getting the fuck out of here.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.784
Something really fucking weird
is going on. Baby, baby, baby,

29:04.952 --> 29:06.494
go get the car.
I'm gonna go get our shit.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.329
- We gotta get the fuck out of here.
- Why?

29:08.497 --> 29:11.165
The radio said this whole fucking area
is quarantined.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.043
Like, some kind of biological weapon
or some shit like that...

29:14.211 --> 29:15.837
Then how can we leave
if it's quarantined?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.547
No, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.841
It's not about how can we leave.
We have to leave.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.385
Okay, if the roads are blocked,
then there's no point in us leaving.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.470
No, no, no, David's right.
We should just go.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.639
And if we get to a roadblock,
then we'll decide what to do.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.850
No, they don't let people
in or out during quarantine.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.893
I don't give a fuck
if they don't let people out!

29:31.061 --> 29:33.563
You didn't see what I just saw!
We have to leave!

29:33.730 --> 29:34.730
What about the infection?

29:34.898 --> 29:37.233
We just need to all stay inside.
That way we don't get it.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.068
- No, we are leaving.
- Look, look...

29:39.236 --> 29:42.029
Guys, guys, hey!
No one is going anywhere.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.948
If the area is quarantined,
we can't fucking...

29:44.116 --> 29:45.908
- (snarling)
- (all screaming)

29:46.076 --> 29:49.412
Howard:
Help! Help! Help!

29:49.580 --> 29:52.540
- Brice: Help me get him!
- Taylor: David!

30:00.591 --> 30:04.010
Howard!
No! No!

30:04.178 --> 30:07.430
- Taylor: Sharley, no!
- Get off of me!

30:07.598 --> 30:09.557
- Naomi: Sharley.
- Back up, Sharley.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.058
(women shouting)

30:11.226 --> 30:13.227
Get off of me!

30:13.395 --> 30:15.688
Back the fuck up.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.857
No. Howard.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.571
- Sharley: No.
- Oh...!

30:23.739 --> 30:25.448
Get off of me!

30:25.616 --> 30:28.409
No. No. No. No.

30:31.246 --> 30:35.416
No. No. Baby. Baby.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.126
No.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.712
Oh, my God.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.760
Holy fuck. Holy fuck.
Dude, get up.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.972
Run! Run!

30:53.143 --> 30:55.478
Oh, my God!
(screaming)

30:58.315 --> 31:01.442
Taylor: Go upstairs...
the attic. Go.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.320
Sharley!
Oh, my God, Sharley!

31:05.697 --> 31:08.324
- We have to go. Sharley, please.
- Get off of me!

31:08.492 --> 31:09.992
Get off!

31:12.746 --> 31:15.248
- (snarling)
- Oh, my God! Go!

31:18.794 --> 31:20.169
Naomi:
Go.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.133
No. Open the door.

31:26.301 --> 31:29.720
Sharley, open the door.
Sharley, let me in.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.305
Sharley, please!

31:31.473 --> 31:32.807
(screaming)

31:32.975 --> 31:34.892
(Naomi screams,
crunching)

31:35.060 --> 31:37.103
Naomi: No!

31:37.271 --> 31:38.854
- Naomi!
- Brice, fucking don't.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.024
Stop.

31:45.195 --> 31:48.406
(Naomi screaming)
Please!

31:48.574 --> 31:51.033
(grunting)
Get off!

31:51.201 --> 31:53.619
(Naomi screams)

31:55.080 --> 31:57.373
- (screaming stops)
- (snarling)

33:17.621 --> 33:19.622
(panting)

33:55.867 --> 33:57.868
I have to go check.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.371
They're still gonna be there.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.087
Taylor: Why are they standing
frozen like that?

34:09.630 --> 34:13.007
That's how the lady
in the road was.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.177
And when I talked to her,
she went crazy.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.268
You know, they said on the radio
that the infected people

34:23.437 --> 34:25.563
might spread the disease
through body fluids.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.857
Body fluids?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.608
Yeah.

34:29.775 --> 34:33.821
So the dog from yesterday
and the people...

34:33.989 --> 34:38.033
it must be some kind of
zoonosis disease.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.243
What is that?

34:39.411 --> 34:43.205
It's any infectious disease
that can be transferred

34:43.373 --> 34:46.917
from humans to animals
and vice versa.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.005
So if we get attacked
by an infected person

34:52.174 --> 34:55.009
or animal,

34:55.177 --> 34:57.595
we could become infected?

34:59.514 --> 35:01.515
I don't know.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.895
So it's kind of like rabies.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.773
Yeah.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.693
Only whatever was in that missile
is so much worse.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.989
(faint growling)

35:37.052 --> 35:39.929
(wood creaking)

35:50.941 --> 35:53.025
Taylor...?

35:53.193 --> 35:55.986
Sharley:
Guys. David...?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.988
Did you guys hear that?

36:01.076 --> 36:02.618
Sharley:
You guys...?

36:02.786 --> 36:05.579
I think that's Sharley.

36:05.747 --> 36:06.997
Sharley:
Are you there?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.250
(low snarling)

36:14.297 --> 36:15.798
(whispering)
Taylor.

36:22.973 --> 36:25.724
- (pounding)
- (Sharley gasps)

36:33.692 --> 36:35.067
(screams)

36:35.235 --> 36:37.319
Leave me the fuck alone!

36:37.487 --> 36:40.030
Alone!
(sobs)

36:42.617 --> 36:45.870
- Taylor: Sharley, over here.
- David: Sharley, we're over here.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.164
- David: You have to run.
- Taylor: Over here.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.376
- Taylor: Get in here. Get in.
- Brice: Hurry. Try to be quiet.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.295
- (sobbing)
- Taylor: It's okay.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.925
It's okay. Shh, it's okay.

37:00.093 --> 37:01.260
Where's Naomi?

37:05.807 --> 37:07.975
(Sharley sobbing)

37:16.067 --> 37:17.651
David:
I'm sorry.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.154
Brice: Just tell us
what happened, okay?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.574
What happened?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.409
What happened to her?

37:25.577 --> 37:28.370
I can't talk about it right now.

37:28.538 --> 37:32.249
Sharley, I just want to know
what happened.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.209
I can't handle this right now.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.670
- Just fucking tell me, all right?
- (sobbing)

37:36.838 --> 37:38.756
Just tell me, all right?

37:49.809 --> 37:51.685
She was my girlfriend.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.271
Sharley:
Howard was my boyfriend.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.693
Sharley...

37:59.861 --> 38:01.946
just... just tell us
what happened, okay?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.365
Just tell us
what happened. Try.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.204
I was downstairs.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.375
She came back for me.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.462
And we ran to the stairs.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.341
And by the time we got to the stairs,
those people were in the house.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.718
And then

38:24.886 --> 38:27.262
I was in front of her
and she was behind me.

38:27.430 --> 38:30.516
And... and one of them
just grabbed her.

38:30.684 --> 38:34.520
And then... then
I couldn't do anything.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.899
I just ran into the room
and I shut the door

38:39.067 --> 38:41.986
and I locked it
and I tried to be quiet.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.530
(sobbing)

38:44.698 --> 38:47.324
Are you sure
that's how it happened?

38:52.956 --> 38:54.456
Yes.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.132
Why wouldn't I help her
if I could?

39:03.299 --> 39:05.175
Guys, listen,

39:05.343 --> 39:07.594
this isn't gonna get us
anywhere, okay?

39:09.597 --> 39:10.973
Okay?

39:11.141 --> 39:13.600
We have to get out of here.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.196
(snarling)

39:29.743 --> 39:31.827
(birds chirping)

39:49.721 --> 39:51.764
I got it.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.808
Got what?

39:56.478 --> 39:59.354
What I should have said to you
when I gave you that ring.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.693
No matter what happens,

40:04.861 --> 40:06.987
you can always count on me.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.156
I'll be there for you...

40:10.742 --> 40:12.618
each and every day.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.414
Yeah, that's what
I should have said.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.917
That would have been
the right thing to say.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.715
Don't worry, baby.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.468
Search and rescue
is gonna be looking for survivors.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.637
We'll be out of here soon.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.181
Brice:
No one is coming.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.896
And we're all gonna starve to death
if we stay up here.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.651
What are you saying?

40:47.278 --> 40:49.571
I'm saying that those things
are still in the house.

40:49.739 --> 40:52.366
And if we stay up here

40:52.534 --> 40:54.952
with no food and no water,
we're all gonna die...

40:55.120 --> 40:57.621
first David...

41:00.166 --> 41:01.667
then me,

41:01.835 --> 41:03.919
then Sharley

41:04.087 --> 41:06.672
and then Taylor.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.841
There is no search and rescue.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.303
Then we have to leave.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.477
How?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.271
Fire escape?

41:22.438 --> 41:24.064
Is that on the side
of the house?

41:24.232 --> 41:26.108
Yeah.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.777
Then, yeah.
We'll climb out of the window

41:28.945 --> 41:30.988
and jump down
on top of the Jeep.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.032
But first someone
is gonna have to go get it

41:34.200 --> 41:36.076
and bring it around
to the side of the house.

41:38.872 --> 41:39.997
Why me?

41:40.165 --> 41:42.416
You just said if we all stay here,
we're all gonna die.

41:42.584 --> 41:44.293
And what about me?

41:44.460 --> 41:47.129
Taylor: You're the running back.
You're the best shot we have.

41:47.297 --> 41:50.549
Hopefully they'll stay frozen.
Just be really quiet.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.765
Okay.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.560
All right, just...
just give me a second.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.272
(exhales)

42:15.491 --> 42:17.367
Give me the keys.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.328
David: All right,
give him the keys, Taylor.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.872
I don't know
where I put them.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.124
- You what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.834
What do you mean, you don't know
where the keys are, Taylor?

42:26.002 --> 42:29.004
I... okay, I had them in my hand
and then I put them on the counter.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.048
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.384
Unless they fell
when those things came in.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.261
Oh, my God, baby,
which one is it?

42:36.429 --> 42:38.764
Seriously, think, think, think.
Do you specifically remember

42:38.932 --> 42:40.766
putting those keys
on the counter?

42:40.934 --> 42:44.228
Yeah... yeah,
they're on the counter.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.855
Look, I don't know, Taylor.
What if they're not on the counter?

42:47.023 --> 42:48.899
We have no choice.

42:49.067 --> 42:52.819
She's right, dude. You know
what happens if we stay up here.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.947
Yeah.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.365
Come here, dude.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.204
All right.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.749
David: You're gonna have to run
to the kitchen,

43:05.917 --> 43:07.751
grab the keys
off the counter, okay?

43:07.919 --> 43:09.795
These guys are gonna be
chasing you.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.421
You're gonna have to
sprint to the car.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.173
When you get to the car,
you're gonna have to drive

43:13.341 --> 43:15.592
a good distance down the road,
lead them away from the house.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.636
And once you get there,
wait a minute

43:17.804 --> 43:20.264
and then light the flare.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.641
And as soon as I see the smoke,
I'm coming down.

43:22.809 --> 43:25.602
I'm gonna be waiting for you
at the bottom of the fire escape.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.940
- You got it?
- I got it.

43:36.823 --> 43:39.032
Brice:
Okay, I'm going.

43:44.747 --> 43:45.956
Be careful.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.708
Yeah, okay.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.378
(sighing deeply)

44:03.641 --> 44:05.475
Please be careful.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.189
(door lock clicks)

44:50.396 --> 44:51.438
(floor creaks)

44:51.606 --> 44:52.773
(snarling)

44:52.940 --> 44:54.941
(panting)

44:59.989 --> 45:01.615
Come on, man.

45:01.783 --> 45:03.784
(banging)

45:07.038 --> 45:09.831
(snarling,
banging continues)

46:13.020 --> 46:15.272
(grunts)

46:34.250 --> 46:35.667
(wood creaks)

46:53.102 --> 46:54.853
Oh, fuck.

46:55.021 --> 46:56.980
- (phone beeps)
- (continuous tone beeping)

46:57.148 --> 46:58.648
Oh.

47:00.359 --> 47:02.652
(winces)

47:02.820 --> 47:04.404
(growls)

47:25.635 --> 47:27.302
(engine starts)

47:27.470 --> 47:29.804
Okay, we're getting the fuck
out of here.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.475
(man snarling)

48:06.717 --> 48:08.218
(softly)
Fuck...!

48:09.554 --> 48:11.513
(tires screeching)

48:13.808 --> 48:15.392
(grunts)

48:15.560 --> 48:17.352
Oh, my God.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.813
- He's not coming back.
- Shh. Quiet, Sharley.

48:19.981 --> 48:23.024
He left us.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.193
(panting)

48:43.963 --> 48:46.756
David:
Shh. Quiet, Sharley.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.259
- He left us.
- Sharley, shut up.

48:53.306 --> 48:55.724
- He fucking left us!
- Sharley, shut the fuck up.

48:55.891 --> 48:58.268
Sharley, shh. Quiet.

49:08.195 --> 49:11.031
(fizzling)

49:16.245 --> 49:18.538
Okay, there it is.

49:18.706 --> 49:21.249
All right, I'm gonna climb down first
and help you girls down.

49:21.417 --> 49:22.584
Okay.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.592
(breathing deeply)

49:32.970 --> 49:34.471
Hmm.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.315
(snarling)

49:50.571 --> 49:53.490
- Fuck you!
- (thumps)

49:53.658 --> 49:55.700
Ooh.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.713
- Brice: Come on, hurry.
- Okay, all right.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.465
Brice:
Hurry.

50:12.093 --> 50:13.551
Brice:
Come on.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.804
- Come on, Sharley, come on.
- Okay.

50:15.971 --> 50:19.015
Come on, Sharley, come on.
Come on, Sharley.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.148
Sharley: Go get Taylor.
Oh, shit.

50:28.484 --> 50:30.360
(snarling)

50:30.528 --> 50:31.986
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck. Come on.

50:32.154 --> 50:33.488
Come on, Taylor!

50:33.656 --> 50:36.241
- Sharley: Oh, my God.
- David: Taylor!

50:36.409 --> 50:37.909
Taylor, please, just jump!

50:38.077 --> 50:40.745
Sharley:
Taylor!

50:40.913 --> 50:42.914
Sharley: Oh, my God.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

50:43.082 --> 50:45.709
- (people snarling)
- (women screaming)

50:57.763 --> 50:58.930
Fuck!

51:02.268 --> 51:04.561
- Argh!
- David: Brice, stop the car.

51:04.729 --> 51:07.480
(screams)

51:07.648 --> 51:09.274
Fuck, Brice.

51:09.442 --> 51:10.900
Taylor, come on, go.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.610
Go. Come on,
come on, come on.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.904
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.828
Okay. Baby, baby,
are you okay?

51:21.996 --> 51:23.705
- Are you okay? Okay.
- I thought...

51:23.873 --> 51:26.249
- Quiet. Quiet.
- I thought he was gonna get me.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.084
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

51:28.252 --> 51:32.005
Shh. Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Shh. Shh. Quiet.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.716
Sharley: Brice, just keep going
on this road about two more miles

51:34.884 --> 51:38.011
and it's gonna hit the main road.
And that's gonna take us through town.

51:38.179 --> 51:40.638
All right. Okay.

51:40.806 --> 51:43.183
David:
It's okay. It's okay.

51:47.563 --> 51:49.230
(tires screech)

51:58.240 --> 52:00.992
Where is everybody?
There's no one out here.

52:11.545 --> 52:13.171
- Brice: Oh.
- (screams)

52:14.423 --> 52:15.924
Dude, look out!

52:26.393 --> 52:27.852
(Brice groaning)

52:32.608 --> 52:34.442
- Brice: Argh!
- David: Are you okay?

52:34.610 --> 52:36.236
Brice: Oh, shit, my leg!

52:36.403 --> 52:38.363
- (women whimpering)
- David: Can you move?

52:38.531 --> 52:40.782
Sharley: Oh, my God.
I'm stuck.

52:40.950 --> 52:43.034
- Guys, I'm stuck!
- David: Sharley, Sharley. Grab her leg.

52:43.202 --> 52:45.495
- Sharley: Oh, my God!
- Sharley, I'm gonna pull your legs out.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.831
Ready? Come on. One, two, three.
Grab the right leg.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.749
- Pull that leg.
- (Sharley screaming)

52:49.917 --> 52:51.584
Grab it right here.
Come on, grab that right leg.

52:51.752 --> 52:53.795
- It's okay, Sharley.
- David, David, grab her.

52:53.963 --> 52:56.047
(screams)

52:56.215 --> 52:58.591
Taylor: Get her out!

52:58.759 --> 53:00.134
Brice: We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

53:00.302 --> 53:02.804
- Taylor: Hurry!
- (all screaming)

53:02.972 --> 53:05.515
- Come on!
- Oh, my God.

53:05.683 --> 53:08.351
- Taylor: Come on.
- David: Get up, get up. Go, go, go.

53:08.519 --> 53:11.229
- David: Come on.
- (Brice grunting)

53:11.397 --> 53:13.731
All:
Come on, come on.

53:38.424 --> 53:41.259
- Over here.
- Go, go, go.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.773
- David: Hurry up.
- (Brice grunting)

54:10.873 --> 54:13.791
Women: In here.
Guys, get in here.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.632
Brice:
Holy fuck. Shit.

54:28.599 --> 54:31.017
Watch out. Watch out.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.353
(distant snarling)

54:43.948 --> 54:46.407
Now what are we gonna do?

54:46.575 --> 54:47.992
(Brice moans)

54:48.160 --> 54:51.579
We gotta do something about his knee.
I mean, that looks bad.

54:51.747 --> 54:55.708
Yeah. Okay, I need something
to wrap it with... anything.

54:58.170 --> 54:59.587
Here. Here.

54:59.755 --> 55:01.631
Perfect.
Okay, now I'm gonna need

55:01.799 --> 55:03.716
something to sterilize
the wound...

55:03.884 --> 55:06.260
antibiotic, alcohol... anything.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.014
Taylor:
Oh, God.

55:10.182 --> 55:11.933
Brice:
I'll be all right,

55:12.101 --> 55:14.018
but we need to figure
something out.

55:14.186 --> 55:17.355
Okay.
Okay, what's our plan?

55:17.523 --> 55:19.315
It'd be stupid to go back out there
with those things.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.442
Let's stay here
and rest for the night.

55:21.610 --> 55:22.777
But is he gonna be okay
with that knee?

55:22.945 --> 55:25.113
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
We just need to find him

55:25.280 --> 55:27.740
medical attention in the morning,
as soon as possible.

55:27.908 --> 55:31.452
Do we even think there's anyone
out there normal like us?

55:31.620 --> 55:34.956
Yeah, of course there's...
there's other people like us.

55:35.124 --> 55:37.417
Yeah, can't be
the whole country's gone mad.

55:40.629 --> 55:43.798
Look, you guys, you all try
and get some rest or something.

55:43.966 --> 55:45.383
I'm gonna stay up
and keep watch.

55:45.551 --> 55:48.011
What? Are you crazy? I'm not gonna
be able to sleep after all this.

55:48.178 --> 55:49.303
Yeah, me neither.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.097
Yeah, hell, no.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.893
Well, try to get some rest, okay?

55:56.061 --> 55:58.688
In the morning we'll head out
and find some help.

55:58.856 --> 56:01.315
And what if there is no help?

56:06.321 --> 56:08.614
(faint growling)

56:49.073 --> 56:51.074
(panting)

56:54.036 --> 56:56.454
(growling softly)

57:01.251 --> 57:04.212
- (snarling)
- (screaming)

57:08.258 --> 57:10.635
(panting)

57:12.471 --> 57:15.223
Oh, my God.

57:15.390 --> 57:17.892
Oh, my God.
Sorry, guys.

57:18.060 --> 57:19.769
David:
It's okay.

57:19.937 --> 57:22.647
It's just... it's just a dream.

57:22.815 --> 57:25.233
It's just a bad dream.

57:27.277 --> 57:30.738
Oh, my God, please tell me
this is all just a dream.

57:30.906 --> 57:33.699
Taylor: Guys,
we should get going.

57:34.993 --> 57:37.161
David:
All right.

57:37.329 --> 57:39.664
(Brice grunting)

57:42.292 --> 57:45.169
David: Dude, we gotta
get him out of here.

57:48.882 --> 57:51.050
(grunting)

57:52.386 --> 57:54.178
(creaking)

58:12.030 --> 58:14.532
I don't see any of them.

58:16.160 --> 58:17.451
You all ready to go?

58:17.619 --> 58:18.911
Yeah.

58:24.376 --> 58:26.169
(creaking)

58:30.382 --> 58:32.884
(Brice grunting softly)

59:17.387 --> 59:20.556
We should go there and find
something for Brice's leg.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.391
No, let's keep going, you guys.

59:22.559 --> 59:25.436
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Let's just keep on moving.

59:25.604 --> 59:28.606
No, Taylor's right, man.
We gotta fix that leg up.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.257
(doorbell chimes)

59:54.424 --> 59:57.009
(recorded music playing)

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.492
Stop, stop, stop.

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.001
Stop.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.335
- David.
- Stop.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.132

(flies buzzing)

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.751
Another one of those
fucking frozen things.

Let's go back.
Let's go back.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.547
No, no. Shh, shh, shh.
No way.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.966
Let's just keep moving forward,

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.301
try and sneak past him
while he's still frozen.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.345
Look, there's no way we're going back.
There's too many of them.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:24.224
I think he's right.
There's just one of them.

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:26.435
We gotta go that way.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:31.439
We cannot make
a fucking sound, okay?

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.859

We gotta go back.
We gotta go back.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:40.008
Baby, we can't.
I mean, we're so fucking close already.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.844
David, it's too dangerous.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.554
We don't have enough time.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.066
(tower bells ringing)

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.198

- (recorded music playing)
- Brice: We need time to think.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.579
It's just not fair.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.873
It's just not... it's not fair.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.823
I'm tired.

Be strong. Let's get up.

All right, all right.
Give me the bag.

You've got to be kidding me.

- of the Southeast University structure.
- God damn it! Argh!

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.532
Taylor: It's just across the street.
Let's go.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.297
(Taylor whispers)
Quiet.

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:25.695
(whispering)
Brice, this way.

01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:31.910
Okay, come on.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:58.603
(whispers)
Wait.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.663
- We can sneak past them.
- No.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.665
Trust me.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.233
(shattered glass crunches)

Oh, Okay.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.646
Taylor, come on.
What are you doing?

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.522
Taylor:
Give me the lighter.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:14.072

Take that, asshole.

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:16.240

Shit. Come on.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.191

Brice.

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:02.203
Brice:
I'm over here.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.664
- Taylor: Where?
- The next flight up.

01:24:04.832 --> 01:24:07.542
Taylor: Listen. I think they went
the other way.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.963
Here, take my hand.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:15.883
It's dark in here.

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:24.934
