Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:08.560 --> 00:12.720
You can't take down the entire NlD,
and they'll kill you for trying.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.360
You might be able to hold the evidence
over them and get Hammond reinstated.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.360
- l'm not leavin' till l get what l came for.
- And what are you going to do?

00:21.480 --> 00:24.800
Well, l was thinking about shootin' ya.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.520
Kinsey's online activities connect him to
NlD actions over the last year and a half.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.680
Hell, you've been back in time,
forward in time. You've seen it all.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.400
l just wonder how things turn out.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.040
l wonder how far you'd go to stop me
becoming president of the United States.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.920
(crowd screams)

01:44.640 --> 01:46.640
Senator's been hit

02:00.360 --> 02:02.320
(sirens)

03:08.680 --> 03:12.800
The assassination of Senator Kinsey has
sent shock waves through Washington.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.680
With his party's convention
just weeks away,

03:15.760 --> 03:18.640
the senator was considered
their most likely choice

03:18.760 --> 03:22.280
for second spot on the presidential ticket.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.240
Hey l'm back.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.520
What'd l miss?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.800
Sir, Senator Kinsey is dead. He was shot.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.160
- What?
- lt's been all over the news for three days.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.920
- l've been on vacation.
- lt looks like a professional hit.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.840
The shooter fired from a hotel room
across the street and then disappeared.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.240
- Any suspects?
- Police aren't saying anything.

03:48.320 --> 03:54.480
One can assume that a man in Senator
Kinsey's position will have many enemies.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.080
Colonel.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.960
General.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.480
l'm sorry, but these men are here
to escort you to Peterson.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.560
You'll be flown to Andrews and turned
over to the authorities in Washington.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.080
Sir, what is this?

04:08.160 --> 04:12.960
Colonel O'Neill is under arrest
for the murder of Senator Kinsey.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.280
What?

04:17.800 --> 04:21.680
- You'll have to come with us, sir.
- l don't think so.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.480
- Colonel...
- General, l've been on vacation.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.240
l believe you, Jack, but for the moment
we're going to have to cooperate.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.000
- There's no way Colonel O'Neill did this.
- Yes, Major, but my hands are tied.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.920
How could they think he did it?
He wasn't in Washington.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.520
Actually, it looks like he was.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.160
Major Davis is acting as liaison between
the Pentagon and the district attorney.

04:54.240 --> 04:58.080
- He has a report for us. Major?
- Thank you, sir.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.880
This is from a security camera in a hotel
across the street from the shooting,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.240
just a couple of minutes after it happened.

05:11.280 --> 05:15.760
The trajectory of the bullet indicates that
the shot did in fact come from this hotel.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.320
- That doesn't prove anything.
- Based on this,

05:18.440 --> 05:23.720
the FBl searched the colonel's house
and his cabin. They didn't find anything.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.840
But a neighbour said they saw Colonel
O'Neill dumping something by the lake.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.600
They sent down a diver,
who came up with this.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.920
Ballistics match it with the bullet
that killed Senator Kinsey.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.280
l don't know what to say, sir. lt's no secret
there was bad blood between them.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.520
Come on. They had a few run-ins.
That's hardly a motive for murder.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.200
l've read the file on Kinsey,
but it is a little vague.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.680
The senator was involved with individuals

06:03.800 --> 06:07.360
who were unhappy with the way
Stargate Command was being run.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.840
They tried to force
General Hammond to resign.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.120
Colonel O'Neill connected
Kinsey to their illegal activities

06:13.240 --> 06:16.480
and threatened to go public
unless he got them to back off.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.760
So, technically,
Kinsey was protecting the SGC.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.000
True, but he wasn't happy about it.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.360
But that's not a motive to kill him.
lt's a motive to keep him alive.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.560
Unfortunately, we can divulge none of
this information to the civilian authorities.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.680
Senator Kinsey was shot
in broad daylight on a public street,

06:33.800 --> 06:35.680
in front of civilian witnesses.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.240
lf we tried to shift this to a military court,

06:38.360 --> 06:41.200
it would be a disaster
for the current administration.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.880
With respect, the current administration
owes a lot to the colonel.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.360
l'm aware of that, Major,
as is the president.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.520
Unfortunately, there's nothing
he can do for Colonel O'Neill at this time.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.320
On the other hand, l'm not a politician,

06:54.440 --> 06:57.200
which is why l'm suspending
SG-1's offworld duties

06:57.280 --> 06:59.720
and assigning you
to get to the bottom of this.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.880
The full resources of this command
are at your disposal.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
- Thank you, sir.
- Dismissed.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.280
(buzzer)

07:27.080 --> 07:29.040
Colonel.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.040
How are you doin'?

07:33.160 --> 07:38.480
l'm accused of a murder l didn't commit.
How do you think l'm doin'?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.800
When are you being
transferred to Washington?

07:47.880 --> 07:50.160
Couple of days.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.840
General Hammond has suspended
our offworld duties

07:52.920 --> 07:57.440
in order that we may
investigate this situation further.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.160
Unfortunately, it's not going very well.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.960
There is evidence that places you
at the scene of the shooting.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.040
l was fishing.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.800
Look, Kinsey wasn't exactly
my best buddy,

08:12.880 --> 08:16.160
and on occasion l felt like
beating the crap out of him,

08:16.240 --> 08:18.000
but l didn't kill him.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.600
They somehow have a video

08:21.720 --> 08:26.240
that clearly places you
in Washington DC three days ago.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.560
l don't believe this.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.840
We know you've been
on secret missions before.

08:31.960 --> 08:36.799
l wasn't on a mission, Jonas.
l was in Minnesota, on vacation.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.640
Did you encounter anyone
that can verify your story?

08:39.760 --> 08:43.280
l was 20 miles away
from the closest town, alone.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.280
That was the point.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.680
Perhaps this is all
part of an elaborate plan.

08:51.800 --> 08:57.640
Those responsible chose to act at a time
when they knew you would have no alibi.

09:00.480 --> 09:05.200
l checked the video to see if it had been
doctored, but it appears to be genuine.

09:05.280 --> 09:10.960
So either that really is Colonel O'Neill
or someone who looks exactly like him.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.840
We have encountered
duplicating technology before.

09:13.960 --> 09:18.160
l was thinking the same thing, but those
mimic devices are under heavy guard.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.400
Mimic devices?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.800
Someone wanna fill me in?

09:27.320 --> 09:30.640
Three years ago, we had
a foothold situation here at the SGC.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.360
Aliens gained control
by using mimic devices

09:33.480 --> 09:37.520
to impersonate and then replace
base personnel, including myself.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.480
- Why haven't l heard this before?
- Given the seriousness of the breach,

09:41.560 --> 09:46.960
a decision was made to erase all mention
of the incident from official records.

09:47.080 --> 09:51.440
- Where are these devices now?
- Area 51 .

09:59.920 --> 10:03.200
- How many do you have?
- We recovered 12 from the SGC.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.280
They're all stored here.

10:05.400 --> 10:10.960
- Has anyone studied them recently?
- We've all been focusing on the X-303.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.560
There we go.
All present and accounted for.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.560
lt's a fake.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.960
All the mimic devices were switched.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.440
Someone duplicated the duplicators?

10:39.520 --> 10:44.200
The last test was six months ago. lt could
have been taken any time after that.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.000
There has got to be some way
that we can use this to clear you.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.400
l don't think the alien-technology
defence is gonna fly.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.360
lf l understand this,
there is someone out there

10:55.440 --> 10:59.120
that can make himself look exactly
like you. That's gotta be relevant.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.640
lt's classified information, Jonas.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.640
But we can use it to find
the real assassin... maybe.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.160
- So how do these things work?
- lt's a two-part process.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.880
First, you pass a person
through a scanning device,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.160
which uploads their image
into a holographic sequencer.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.240
- Which looks like this.
- Exactly.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.560
Then you place that sequencer
on your body

11:32.640 --> 11:36.000
and you instantly take on
the appearance of the person scanned.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.880
- Was the scanning device taken?
- No, it's still at Area 51 . We checked it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.800
So they can only impersonate
a limited number of people.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.680
12, to be precise, including
Colonel O'Neill, Dr Fraiser and Daniel.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.480
What about General Hammond?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.840
The alien impersonating him
was trapped with several others.

11:51.960 --> 11:56.880
They activated some kind of self-destruct
and blew themselves up.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.080
ln case you're wondering,
Teal'c and l were never scanned.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.080
That's good to know.

12:02.160 --> 12:06.320
l've requested all the personnel files on
those who had access to these devices.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.720
l'd like the two of you to check them out.

12:08.840 --> 12:12.080
- What about you?
- l'm going to Washington.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.200
l need to look up an old acquaintance.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.840
Major Carter.
l'm here to see Agent Barrett.

12:35.160 --> 12:39.440
Major Carter. l was wondering
how long it would be before you came by.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.240
Welcome to NlD headquarters.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.720
Only eight people at Area 51 have had
authorised access to the mimic devices.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.560
- We must speak to them all.
- Most have moved to the X-303 project,

12:50.680 --> 12:53.240
so they're still living in Nevada.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.040
Wait a minute. There's something.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.120
Dr Brent Langham.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.240
Deceased.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.360
Killed in an automobile accident
three weeks ago.

13:05.480 --> 13:10.320
Given the circumstance, that would seem
to be a highly unlikely coincidence.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.480
What exactly are you
implying here, Major?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.720
That the NlD had a hand
in the assassination of a US senator?

13:18.840 --> 13:23.120
Very few organisations have the
resources to pull off something like this.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.760
And the man accused
happens to belong to one of them.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.080
The SGC is not behind this.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.960
Senator Kinsey was no friend
of the Stargate Command.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.040
He tried to take you down more than once.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.440
We don't engage in criminal activity,
Agent Barrett, unlike the NlD.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.160
The Prometheus incident was
orchestrated by a handful of rogue agents.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.080
What about Steveston, Oregon?
You sat by and watched

13:46.200 --> 13:49.120
while the Goa'uld took over
an entire town of civilians.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.840
That was an officially
sanctioned operation.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.240
lt would've succeeded if it wasn't for you.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.360
Are you kidding me?
Your agents were compromised

13:57.440 --> 14:00.720
and your organisation
was about to be infiltrated.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.640
Look, Major...

14:02.720 --> 14:06.880
The videotape of Colonel O'Neill clearly
places him at the scene of the crime,

14:06.960 --> 14:10.160
and the murder weapon
was found near his cabin.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.120
So, if you'll excuse me...

14:17.840 --> 14:19.840
l've got work to do.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.960
lt says here that by 2075

14:41.080 --> 14:44.960
the Earth's oceans will be too warm
to sustain most coral reefs

14:45.080 --> 14:48.720
and, once they're gone, the ecosystem
of the planet will collapse.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.880
That's a cheerful thought.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.880
We spend all of our time trying
to protect the world from the Goa'uld.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.960
Maybe we should worry a little more
about protecting it from ourselves.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.400
What are we doing out here,
Agent Barrett?

15:01.520 --> 15:03.520
My office is bugged.

15:04.480 --> 15:09.360
lt's standard procedure to record
all conversations in NlD headquarters.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.440
What l'm about to say, Major, nobody else
can know, especially my superiors.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.240
What are you talking about?

15:17.840 --> 15:22.680
There's a cancer at the NlD, a shadow
organisation that operates outside the law.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.920
- lt's time they were exposed.
- l agree.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.640
The Prometheus incident
was the last straw.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.680
l was called to the White House
for an assignment.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.320
What does this have to do
with Colonel O'Neill?

15:34.440 --> 15:36.800
Senator Kinsey was working for me.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.960
He was about to give me enough evidence
to bring down the leadership of the group.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.440
How did you convince him to do that?

15:43.520 --> 15:47.120
l know about a few of the skeletons
in the senator's closet.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.760
- And it is an election year.
- You blackmailed him.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.400
l'll do whatever it takes
to bring these people down, Major.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.400
Who else knows about this?

16:00.480 --> 16:04.000
As of this moment, the president,
a few members of his staff, and you.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.000
- You're working alone?
- The smaller the operation, the better.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.520
You have no idea how far the corruption
goes. The SGC isn't immune.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.880
You're taking a big risk talking to me.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.880
l need your help.
And you haven't told me everything.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.480
What makes you so sure
that Colonel O'Neill is innocent?

16:20.560 --> 16:23.000
When you work with someone
that long, you know.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.200
There's something more than that.
There's something you're not telling me.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.360
Your job requires you to be suspicious
of everybody, even your co-workers.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.480
Where l'm from, we trust each other
with our lives every day.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.280
Maybe that's something
you can't understand.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.240
l guess it's never too late to learn.

16:45.480 --> 16:50.160
When the mimic devices were found, eight
scientists were assigned to study them.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.280
The Pentagon hoped to adapt
the devices for use in the field.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.640
However, while the holographic images
created by the aliens lasted indefinitely,

16:58.720 --> 17:02.800
those created in the lab only lasted
for three to four minutes at a time,

17:02.880 --> 17:05.599
due to problems with
electromagnetic interference.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.599
So the project was scaled back, and five
of the team members were reassigned.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.440
The remaining three were
Dr Singh, Dr Healey,

17:12.520 --> 17:15.599
and this fellow - Dr Brent Langham.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.880
They continued working for six months
with no breakthroughs.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.119
Finally, the project was shut down.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.560
Dr Healey and Dr Singh
were transferred to the X-303 project.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.079
And Dr Langham?

17:26.200 --> 17:30.640
He was supposedly killed in a car crash
two days before the transfer was due.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.920
The body was burned.
He was identified through dental records.

17:34.040 --> 17:37.680
But the coroner missed something.
Toxicology report came back clean.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.320
No signs of any drugs or alcohol
in the victim's blood.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.920
- Why is that unusual?
- Dr Langham was epileptic.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.320
His condition required regular doses
of anticonvulsant drugs.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.920
There should have been
traces of those drugs.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.760
The dental records were falsified.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.920
The body recovered
at the crash site was someone else.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.000
So you're saying this Dr Langham
took the mimic device

18:00.080 --> 18:03.840
- and engineered his own disappearance.
- Or someone engineered it for him.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.360
Are we suggesting, then,
that this scientist shot Kinsey?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.920
l doubt it. He had
no paramilitary training.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.520
Perhaps Dr Langham merely
provided the mimic devices for a fee.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.400
But he can lead us
to whoever was responsible.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.920
l don't care what it takes.
l want you to find this Dr Langham.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.000
Yes, sir.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.480
OK, what is this?

18:32.600 --> 18:37.440
The rifle used to kill Senator Kinsey was
not one you pick up at your local store.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.120
This is a one-stop shop
for unregistered weapons.

18:40.200 --> 18:44.880
High-end goods, professional clientele.
There's a chance our shooter was here.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.200
Why don't you shut them down?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.840
l let them operate
in exchange for information.

18:49.960 --> 18:54.080
Sometimes you gotta cross the line.
You just gotta know when to step back.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.480
- Hey, Leo.
- Leo.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.480
Agent Barrett. When are you gonna
get yourself a new suit?

19:18.560 --> 19:22.640
- Black is good for any occasion.
- lt's also thinning.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.160
Who's your friend?

19:24.240 --> 19:28.480
Major Samantha Carter,
United States Air Force.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.920
We can talk in front of her.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.440
What can l do for you?

19:35.560 --> 19:38.560
We wanna know about a 700
with a customised breakdown stock.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.520
Yeah. l moved one last week.

19:41.640 --> 19:47.120
ln all likelihood, the weapon you sold
was used to assassinate a US senator.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.360
What's your point?

19:49.440 --> 19:52.160
Was the buyer a regular customer?

19:52.240 --> 19:54.680
No, l never seen him before.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.360
- ls that the guy?
- That's the guy.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.200
Did he look at any other weapons
besides the 700?

20:08.280 --> 20:10.640
As a matter of fact, he did.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.560
A sound-suppressed revolver rifle.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.000
- Did he handle it?
- Sure.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.160
- Was he wearing gloves?
- No.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.880
- Has anybody handled it since?
- No, just Leo here.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.680
How much?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.280
There's one full set of prints
and one partial,

20:41.360 --> 20:44.320
but neither of them match Colonel O'Neill.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.760
lt's a little strange.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.880
Assuming the full set matches Leo,

20:48.960 --> 20:51.560
that would mean the partial
belongs to the shooter.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.560
- Maybe.
- lt's the best lead we have.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.240
The shooter probably
won't have a criminal record.

20:58.360 --> 21:02.880
ln fact, there's a good chance
he may not exist on any database at all.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.920
Except maybe NlD personnel files.

21:08.160 --> 21:12.080
You said it yourself, Agent Barrett -
there's a cancer in your organisation.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.920
Kinsey was gonna bring them down,
so they had him killed.

21:15.040 --> 21:19.680
So did they hire an outside contractor
or use one of their own?

21:21.840 --> 21:24.000
Give me the disk.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.320
l'll check the files
and call you in a couple of hours.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.280
Good call, checking for a second weapon.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.840
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.240
So where do we start?

21:53.360 --> 21:56.320
lt is probable that Dr Langham
has assumed a new identity.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.360
New name, new address,
new social security number.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.680
Can't change his medical condition.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.880
Do not many thousands of people
suffer from this affliction?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.920
Yes, but there's a wide
range of treatments.

22:08.040 --> 22:12.400
Dr Langham was on specific drugs,
including primidone and carbamazepine.

22:12.480 --> 22:16.240
So... we can access
the national pharmaceutical database

22:16.360 --> 22:19.680
and focus on new prescriptions
written in the past three weeks.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.040
We cross-reference that
with age and gender,

22:22.160 --> 22:24.880
and we should be able
to narrow down the field.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.440
- Have Teal'c and Jonas found anything?
- They have a lead on a missing scientist.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.880
They think he may have
taken the mimic devices.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.200
lf the shooter was NlD, we can track him
using the prints from the second rifle.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.560
What about this Agent Barrett?
Are you sure you can trust him?

22:46.640 --> 22:48.080
l think so.

22:48.160 --> 22:52.800
You mustn't tell him about the foothold
incident. l shouldn't have even told Jonas.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.240
l know, sir.
l'm hoping it won't come to that.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.760
l'll keep you posted, sir.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.080
- So?
- You were right.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.600
The prints match
an NlD agent named Mark Devlin.

23:21.440 --> 23:25.120
- How'd you learn to drive?
- Daniel Jackson instructed me.

23:25.240 --> 23:29.200
- When was that?
- l believe the year was 1969.

23:40.800 --> 23:46.000
- Can l help you?
- We're looking for a Mr David Zwydel.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.400
- That's me. What's this about?
- Our apologies.

23:50.520 --> 23:55.200
- You are not the man we are looking for.
- Sorry, l must have made a mistake.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.920
Have a good day.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.960
- That guy look familiar to you?
- He did not.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.960
Really?

24:07.080 --> 24:09.520
He looked familiar to me.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.280
No, wait, wait, wait.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.360
l know that guy.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.960
When l first came to Stargate Command,
he was an airman in the gate room.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.080
l'm positive.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.840
Mr Zwydel.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.160
Mr Zwydel

24:28.880 --> 24:30.880
Around back.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.800
Nice shot.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.040
Dr Langham, l presume.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.480
lndeed.

25:19.080 --> 25:24.200
- You found Dr Langham.
- He's in a holding cell on level 16.

25:24.280 --> 25:29.040
- Well done. Has he said anything?
- No, sir. But he did ask for a lawyer.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.800
That could be a problem. We're not
following proper procedure here.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.400
Sir, he stole top-secret material
and is an accessory to murder.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.480
Dr Langham is also the only one that
can verify Colonel O'Neill's innocence.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.920
Not necessarily. Major Carter
and Agent Barrett are pursuing a lead

25:44.040 --> 25:46.640
that may take them to the real assassin.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.360
- And if it doesn't?
- l know how you feel.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.760
No one wants Colonel O'Neill back more
than l do, but this is a delicate situation.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.480
l understand this man had some injuries
when you brought him in.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.880
Dr Langham was reluctant
to accompany us back to the SGC.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.960
- He required some convincing.
- All l'm saying is we have to be careful.

26:09.040 --> 26:14.160
We're way outside our jurisdiction
and, like it or not, this man has rights.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.720
He will volunteer the information.
Of that l am certain.

27:08.160 --> 27:12.000
Look, this is a waste of time.
l got nothing to say.

27:18.480 --> 27:24.000
OK, l took the mimic devices, but l didn't
know what they were planning to do.

27:27.680 --> 27:33.040
What? You think l'm part of some kinda
murder conspiracy? Well, you're wrong.

27:43.080 --> 27:48.880
All right, l'll tell you what l know,
but you have to promise me protection.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.360
(knocks)

28:32.760 --> 28:34.960
l'll get us in.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.240
- What are you doing?
- Covering you.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.920
Thank you. Get up.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.800
Right.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.640
When you switched the devices,
where'd you take them?

29:26.760 --> 29:29.600
Washington. They wanted me
to take them myself,

29:29.680 --> 29:32.880
because using a middleman
would be too risky.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.680
- To whom are you referring?
- They call themselves the Committee.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
They run the whole show.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.280
We're going to need names.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.200
This is conspiracy to commit murder.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.640
l didn't know they'd use
the devices to kill anybody.

29:48.720 --> 29:53.200
They told me they were gonna analyse the
technology for commercial applications.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.080
Why would you believe that?

29:56.200 --> 29:59.040
You don't think money
has anything to do with this?

29:59.160 --> 30:04.400
ln six months, there have been at least
ten new patents traceable to Area 51 .

30:04.520 --> 30:09.920
l'm talking industrial chemicals,
metallurgy, computers, you name it.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.600
- So they're selling alien technology?
- No, they're buying it.

30:13.680 --> 30:18.000
The members of the Committee aren't
secret agents, they're businessmen.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.880
The rogue NlD agents work for them.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.240
They got millions invested
and they expect to make billions

30:24.320 --> 30:29.120
by incorporating alien advancements
into their product lines.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.120
This was about protecting the planet.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.400
Nobody said it had to be
a non-profit business.

30:36.040 --> 30:39.440
Give us the names
and we'll ensure your safety.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.400
Well, l'm gonna need a few more details.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.920
You work for the air force.
You don't have witness protection.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.480
But we do have the Stargate.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.200
- What do you mean?
- lf these men are as powerful as you say,

30:53.280 --> 30:56.240
there's probably nowhere
on Earth you'd be safe.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.120
Fortunately, we have other options.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.440
We need to talk.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.960
Who else knows about
this operation at Stargate Command?

31:11.040 --> 31:12.240
Why?

31:12.320 --> 31:14.480
- We've got a leak, Major.
- Wait a minute.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.920
Agent Devlin was waiting for us.
Somebody tipped him off.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.960
Not necessarily. Think about it.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.840
You used a computer
to access those personnel files.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.000
Maybe somebody tracked you.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.640
- (phone)
- Don't answer that.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.160
- lt's General Hammond.
- lf they think we're dead, that's good.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.560
You trust me, you trust my team.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.840
Sir, what's happening?

31:38.920 --> 31:41.120
Did he talk?

31:42.120 --> 31:44.080
No, that's great news.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.880
Yes, sir. Understood.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.480
What is it?

31:51.200 --> 31:54.960
We've got the names of those
responsible for the assassination.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.080
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We have an inside source.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.160
Who?

32:01.520 --> 32:03.280
l can't.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.760
This assignment
came from the White House.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.920
lf you don't tell me what l need to know,
l'm gonna have to make a phone call.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.920
You're the one who's
always talking about trust.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.440
The man who shot Kinsey
was using a piece of alien technology.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.560
A device which creates
a flawless holographic disguise -

32:28.640 --> 32:31.680
in this case, a duplicate image
of Colonel O'Neill.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.720
lt was a perfect plan to
get rid of Kinsey and the colonel.

32:34.800 --> 32:39.920
Wait a minute. Why have l never
heard about this technology before?

32:40.040 --> 32:45.040
We encountered the devices during
a foothold situation. lt was a close one.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.840
Kinsey wanted to shut down
the Stargate programme,

32:47.920 --> 32:50.240
so it was covered up
by presidential order.

32:50.360 --> 32:54.880
- Who's your source?
- A scientist at Area 51 .

32:55.000 --> 32:57.680
- He smuggled the devices out.
- That's not enough.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.960
They're onto us. lf we don't
move fast, they'll disappear.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.320
We need more than one scientist
who made a deal for immunity.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.960
That's all we have.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.760
What?

33:12.480 --> 33:15.200
Senator Kinsey's not dead.
He's in a coma.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.720
- We've got him under 24-hour guard.
- Why didn't you tell me?

33:18.800 --> 33:22.720
Because we needed to keep
his condition a secret for his protection.

33:22.840 --> 33:28.000
lf he recovers, he can provide us with the
information to bring these people down.

33:28.120 --> 33:33.760
- So we were both keeping secrets.
- That's the way the game's played.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.360
You've got a...

33:42.360 --> 33:45.360
Anyway, the Pentagon's been informed.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.720
They're sending a man to the hospital.

33:47.840 --> 33:50.000
- Did l...?
- Close enough.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.520
- Who are they sending?
- A liaison officer.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.560
- Major Davis.
- Major Davis, yeah.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.760
What?

33:59.880 --> 34:03.920
There are 12 alien devices capable
of mimicking specific individuals.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.880
Major Davis was one of them.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.679
- Sergeant.
- Major Davis.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.360
- l've come to check on the senator.
- Yes, sir.

35:11.760 --> 35:15.760
- Agent Devlin, how did it go?
- Kinsey's dead.

35:15.840 --> 35:19.200
Are you sure? He was supposed
to be dead the first time.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.880
He wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest
this time. So, yeah, l'm sure.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.360
There were a few complications, though.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
(continuous ringing)

35:33.400 --> 35:37.360
- What's goin' on?
- Fire alarm. We need to move him.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.240
We must ask you to wait here, sir.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.480
Why is that, Sergeant?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.160
Secondary casualties
are not our concern.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.680
Major Davis can answer for those as well.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.800
We still have a loose end.
They have Dr Langham in custody.

35:58.920 --> 36:03.040
That's not important. His accusations
will be a minor inconvenience for us.

36:03.160 --> 36:08.720
l suggest we use the mimic devices
to eliminate another thorn in our side.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.000
- Someone at the SGC?
- General Hammond.

36:12.120 --> 36:18.120
Once he's gone, we can replace him
with someone more sympathetic to us.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.640
lf they know about the devices,
they'll be prepared.

36:47.720 --> 36:52.720
Devlin's right. Besides, now that
Kinsey's dead, we have other options.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.920
l think it's time we sent someone
to talk to Hammond,

36:56.040 --> 36:58.600
get him to reconsider
those retirement plans.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.280
He doesn't seem like the type
to bow to pressure.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.000
Well, then, we are going to
have to be very convincing.

37:28.640 --> 37:33.200
Agent Devlin, l would like you
to pay General Hammond a visit.

37:33.320 --> 37:38.880
lmpress upon him our concerns for
the safety and wellbeing of his family.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.000
lf he still refuses to play ball?

37:42.080 --> 37:44.080
Then kill him.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.760
What is this?

37:51.480 --> 37:54.120
General Hammond sends his regards.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.240
Get your hands up. Come on, get 'em up.

38:01.320 --> 38:05.880
The hologram lasted six and a half
minutes. That's a new record for us.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.920
- You took a big risk.
- l knew you were listening.

38:14.040 --> 38:18.960
What makes you think l was gonna come
in before they incriminated themselves?

38:19.040 --> 38:22.320
When you work with someone,
you just know.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.360
Ah, Colonel O'Neill.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.640
Glad you could make it.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.880
What do you want, Kinsey?

38:40.960 --> 38:44.640
l thought we should have a little chat
before we meet the press.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.360
Did you need to gloat a little?

38:49.040 --> 38:52.640
Don't be that way, Jack.
You need this as much as l do.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.360
You'll only get public vindication

38:55.480 --> 38:58.960
if the two of us appear
on the 6 o'clock news shaking hands.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.520
Yeah. l'm not sure it's worth it.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.800
The American people don't want their
air-force officers to be assassins, Jack.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.120
They want them to be heroes.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.400
l'm gonna make you a hero.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.760
Shall we?

39:31.800 --> 39:35.840
First of all, l want to apologise
to you and to the American people

39:35.920 --> 39:40.160
for the deception
surrounding my untimely demise.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.880
lt was an unfortunate
but necessary final step

39:44.000 --> 39:47.040
in my investigation
of certain antidemocratic forces

39:47.120 --> 39:51.040
that had taken root
in several key government agencies.

39:51.160 --> 39:56.720
The ringleaders of this conspiracy
have now been taken into custody.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.920
Of course, taking a bullet was not part of
my original plan to bring these men down.

40:02.040 --> 40:08.640
But the success of the operation was well
worth any personal sacrifice on my part.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.960
And l want the American people
to know that, if elected,

40:13.080 --> 40:17.360
l intend to bring that same determination

40:17.440 --> 40:22.360
and zeal for justice
with me to the White House.

40:23.920 --> 40:28.120
l would also like to thank Colonel
Jack O'Neill of the United States Air Force

40:28.200 --> 40:31.640
for the vital role he played
in my investigation.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.640
l can't go into details
for reasons of national security,

40:35.720 --> 40:37.840
but l can assure you all

40:37.920 --> 40:42.840
that any evidence pointing to the colonel
as my would-be assassin

40:42.960 --> 40:46.080
was simply part of the operation.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.720
Colonel.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.240
Smile, Colonel.
You just won me the election.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.120
