 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.806 --> 00:09.876

01:15.275 --> 01:18.078
 ( slurping )

01:19.546 --> 01:23.883
  Hi. I just got detention.
  Again.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.587
  You know, I'm the only kid
  on "America's Most Wanted"?

01:27.620 --> 01:30.323
   Hey,
   but nothing can ruin my day
   because I'm Kelly's date

01:30.357 --> 01:32.425
for her birthday party
Saturday night.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.631
   So who are you
   going to the party with?

01:38.665 --> 01:40.934
  Can't you two go to the party
  without a date?

01:40.967 --> 01:45.338
Slater, I don't go
to the supermarket
  without a date.

01:45.372 --> 01:48.108
 Come on, Lisa. Slater's right.
 I mean, this is the '90s.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.909
  Men and women can
  go to parties alone

01:49.943 --> 01:51.378
 and it's perfectly acceptable.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.314
Yeah. Of course,
when a guy goes alone,

01:54.347 --> 01:57.117
  it's because he wants to.
  Now when a girl goes alone,

01:57.117 --> 01:59.953
it's because she can't
get a guy to take her.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.290
  Please, I just ate.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.894
Hey, Jessie, when you
do that feminist thing,

02:07.927 --> 02:11.231
 your nose scrunches up
 and you look so cute.

02:12.198 --> 02:15.602
 - We're he-re!
 - Who ca-res?

02:15.635 --> 02:18.071
  So who's got their dates
  for Saturday night?

02:18.071 --> 02:21.207
 - We're working on it.
 - Hey, I've got mine.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.176
( bell rings )

02:23.209 --> 02:25.578
 - We've got gym,
 see you later.
 - All righty.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.083
  Well, Slater, these are
  the good old days.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.419
Yeah, well, enjoy it
while you can, Preppie,

02:32.452 --> 02:34.921
  because I'm going to get
  Kelly back someday.

02:34.954 --> 02:37.590
 Hi, my niece
 is in town...

02:42.696 --> 02:46.132
  Excuse me.
  Would you like to go out
  with my niece Friday night?

02:49.502 --> 02:52.405
Guys?
Guys, I got a problem.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.974
 Just wear a hat, sir.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.512
 Slater, my niece Penny
 is visiting,

02:59.546 --> 03:01.614
   and I need someone
   to show the girl around.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.417
  - What's she look like?
  - She's a Belding.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.589
   I'll catch you later, ma'am.
   l mean, sir.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.293
Mr. Belding,
the word on the street

03:13.326 --> 03:16.529
  is you're looking for
  a mercy date for your niece.
  I'll date anything.

03:16.563 --> 03:20.300
  If I can't find anybody else,
  you'll be
  the first person I call.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.068
  Thanks.
  I'll wear a beeper.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.239
 - Yes?
 - Oh.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.708
 Here, you need
 to sign this.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.311
 ( chuckles ) Another afternoon
 in detention hall.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.147
 - Number nine in a series.
 - No,
 I think that's number eight.

03:34.180 --> 03:37.083
  No, number eight was when you
  sold the school
  to the Japanese.

03:38.084 --> 03:41.254
What's wrong
with Honda High School?

03:41.287 --> 03:44.357
 So this makes nine,
 and 10 is...

03:44.391 --> 03:47.360
  - Don't say it, sir.
  - That's right, suspension!

03:47.394 --> 03:48.995
  It's gonna happen, Morris.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.098
   Not until cows
   give Pepsi, sir.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.236
   Jessie, I have got
   the perfect date for you.

03:56.269 --> 04:00.607
  - He's my next-door neighbor.
  - You live next
  to Kevin Costner?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.943
No, but this guy
is almost as cute,
not nearly as married.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.680
  - Talk to me, girl.
  - His name is Brett, and...

04:06.713 --> 04:09.082
- ( bell rings )
- Watch it. Mr. Hudson.

04:09.115 --> 04:10.183
Right.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.154
   Silence!
   Take your seats!

04:14.187 --> 04:17.490
  You're on my time now.
  No talking, no gum chewing,

04:17.524 --> 04:19.625
   no fun of any...

04:21.761 --> 04:23.496
   ...kind.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.066
   Yesterday, for those of you
   who slept through class,

04:26.066 --> 04:27.600
 we spoke
 about genes.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.337
  Now there are
  two types of genes,

04:30.370 --> 04:32.505
dominant genes,

04:32.539 --> 04:35.141
 and recessive genes.

04:35.175 --> 04:38.511
   Not to be confused
   with blue jeans.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.182
 Enough humor.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.218
Now, if the father
passes along...

04:45.251 --> 04:47.387
  Mr. Morris!

04:47.420 --> 04:50.323
Is that a note
you're taking?

04:50.357 --> 04:52.359
 Uh...

04:52.392 --> 04:54.761
   Yes, sir.
   I'm taking notes.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.530
Good.
Then you'll know this.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.666
 If the father passes along
 a brown-eyed gene,

04:59.699 --> 05:02.602
and the mother passes along
a blue-eyed gene,
what do you get?

05:02.635 --> 05:05.572
 - Uh...
 - Look at your notes.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.113
"A really cute babe
with brown eyes

05:13.146 --> 05:16.049
 who goes to private school."

05:16.082 --> 05:18.485
   - Watch it.
   - Watching, sir.

05:18.518 --> 05:22.422
 Now suppose we have a boy
 and we don't
 know his blood type.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.625
 Now if the mother is O
 and the father is AB,

05:25.658 --> 05:27.627
 what would you
 think about the boy?

05:27.660 --> 05:30.063
  Mr. Morris!

05:30.096 --> 05:31.531
 Read.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.074
   "I won't go out with him
   unless I meet him first."

05:41.107 --> 05:44.077
 Very level-headed.
 And you know,

05:44.110 --> 05:46.179
they need
level-headed people...

05:46.212 --> 05:48.081
  in detention hall!

05:48.114 --> 05:49.549
   Oh, no! Oh, sir!

05:50.583 --> 05:52.619
  You are the cream
  of Bayside.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.622
  The upper crust.
  The tip of the top.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.428
I need a date for
my niece Friday night.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.596
   She an oinker
   or what?

06:04.597 --> 06:06.700
   No, she's not an oinker.

06:06.733 --> 06:10.570
   Sorry,
   I'm in training for the next
   chess tournament.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.706
- So?
- So...

06:12.739 --> 06:16.343
  Coach says women
  sap your strength.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.346
   - All right, what about you?
   - Uh, well, I can't.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.116
  I'm busy all weekend.
  I'm sorting my
  M&M's out by color.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.259
I am in no mood for...

06:34.260 --> 06:37.130
The 10th
detention slip?

06:37.163 --> 06:39.532
Let me hold it!

06:39.566 --> 06:41.701
  <i>* Women:</i>
  <i>Hallelujah!</i>

06:41.735 --> 06:44.204
  <i>* Hallelujah,</i>
  <i>Hallelujah!</i>

06:44.237 --> 06:47.374
<i>* Hallelujah! *</i>

06:48.641 --> 06:50.744
   One week suspension,
   Morris.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.346
  I'm a happy camper.
  ( laughs )

06:53.380 --> 06:55.415
  ( intercom buzzes )

06:56.516 --> 06:59.185
 Yes?
 Okay.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.588
  Hi, honey.

07:01.621 --> 07:04.758
   Well, no, I tried,
   but I couldn't...

07:04.791 --> 07:09.262
 Look, I cannot just force
 anybody to go out with Penny.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.468
  Until now.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.838
Zack...

07:18.872 --> 07:22.175
  I'm going to give
  you another chance.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.611
   You are, sir?
   I don't know what to say.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.579
  I do. Say,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.882
   "What time should I pick up
   your niece Friday night?"

07:28.915 --> 07:31.317
   Mr. Belding,
   that's blackmail.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.353
 Yeah.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.322
 What's your parents'
 number again?

07:36.356 --> 07:39.526
Oh,
you mean this Friday night?
For two hours.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.362
 - Three hours,
 not a minute less.
 - Then it's your treat, $20.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.763
- $20?
- Cash.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.498
  Three hours,
  Friday night, $18.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.734
- 20.
- Deal.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.769
   I'm sorry you
   had to see that.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.938
  I'm sorry
  I had to live that.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.840
Now I'm stuck wasting
a Friday night

07:53.873 --> 07:56.409
   with Mr. Belding's niece.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.479
 - Hey.
 - Hi.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.848
  - You don't look so good.
  - I've been better.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.783
 Don't you get sick
 for my party.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.852
 Don't worry.
 I'll be fine before Saturday.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.855
   Saturday? I didn't tell you.
   The Max was booked,

08:08.888 --> 08:11.491
   so the party got
   moved to Friday. See ya.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.893
Friday?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.628
Whoops.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.505
 What happened to you?

08:25.538 --> 08:28.641
   Skateboard accident, sir.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.911
   No, no, my doctor says
   I'll recover, but,
   you know, no cliff diving,

08:31.945 --> 08:35.815
 no lambada...
 Oh, and absolutely no dating.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.152
  Nice try. But you pulled
  the old skateboard accident

08:39.184 --> 08:40.687
last year at midterms.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.688
   - I did?
   - Mm-hmm.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.325
Man, I got
to keep better records.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.262
  But if you're too
  banged up to go, well,
  then you're suspended again.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.232
 Oh, I... I'm healed!

08:52.265 --> 08:55.902
   Oh, you... You are
   one great principal, sir.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.705
   Spare me. Penny will meet
   you at the mall at 7:00.

08:58.738 --> 08:59.906
   Why at the mall?

09:00.006 --> 09:01.741
 'Cause I don't want you
 to know where I live.

09:01.775 --> 09:05.111
  That's understandable, sir.
  Now,
  how will I recognize Penny?

09:05.145 --> 09:08.715
  You won't. She'll recognize
  you by the red rose
  you'll be carrying.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.583
 Now I told her all about you,

09:10.617 --> 09:12.886
   so don't try
   any of that funny stuff.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.255
 Don't forget the rose,
 because without that,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.023
  she won't know who you are.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.194
  She wouldn't,
  would she?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.730
  Everybody likes him.
  He's good looking,

09:23.763 --> 09:25.765
  funny, nice,
  studious...

09:25.799 --> 09:29.669
 Up until studious I thought
 you were talking about Zack.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.172
  No, it's Brett.
  Jesse's blind date.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.707
 Potential blind date.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.110
 Jessie, take a chance.
 How bad could it be?

09:37.143 --> 09:39.646
  Right, how bad could it be?

09:39.679 --> 09:43.216
 Yeah, how bad
 could it be?

09:45.385 --> 09:50.190
Welcome to
America's favorite show,
"The Blind Date Game."

09:50.223 --> 09:53.126
 ( cheering )

09:53.159 --> 09:55.362
 Today, a lucky girl
 will win a blind date

09:55.395 --> 09:57.864
  with one of these
  eligible bachelors.

09:57.897 --> 10:01.368
  Bachelor number one is
  a night person
  who loves to laugh.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.137
His name is
Teddy Krueger!

10:05.839 --> 10:08.408
   Bachelor number two
   is a real cut-up

10:08.441 --> 10:11.077
 whose relationships
 with girls are always short.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.914
Say hi to
Mason Voorhees.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.984
 Our third bachelor is
 the richest kid in the world.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.653
 Welcome,
 Donald Chump.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.394
 Now let's meet
 a wonderful girl
 who can't get a date.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.829
 Desperate Jessie,
 come on out!

10:30.997 --> 10:32.999
Well, Jessie,
who will it be?

10:35.368 --> 10:37.370
 Don't make me choose.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.472
 Then you get
 all of them!

10:42.008 --> 10:44.878
No! No!

10:44.911 --> 10:46.746
  No!

10:46.780 --> 10:48.248
 Jessie, are you okay?

10:48.281 --> 10:50.216
 Lisa, if you want me
 to go out with Brett,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.085
  I meet him first
  and that is final.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.255
  Fine, you can meet him
  for lunch tomorrow.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.791
   - Are you nervous?
   - Why would I be nervous?

10:57.824 --> 11:00.060
 I'm just a person meeting
 another person. No big deal.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.796
  Great,
  'cause there he is.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.865
  Do I look all right?
  Is my hair behaving itself?

11:05.899 --> 11:09.069
   Your hair is fine.
   Let's go.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.875
  - Oh, hi.
  - You don't have to get up.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.912
This is Jessie.
This is Brett. Goodbye.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.083
 - Hi.
 - Hi, Jessie.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.784
   So, um...

11:24.818 --> 11:26.820
 Lisa says you
 go to private school?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.089
   Yeah. Teachers are
   real nice there,

11:29.089 --> 11:31.291
 but some of the kids
 are kind of rich and stuck-up.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.460
   - Oh, you mean you're not...
   - Stuck up?

11:33.493 --> 11:35.995
 - Rich?
 - Actually, neither.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.264
Both my parents work
just to pay my tuition.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.867
Really?
That's so nice.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.902
 Do your parents work?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.105
 Oh, yeah,
 but they're divorced.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.307
  That's too bad.
  You know, my friend Steve,

11:47.340 --> 11:50.110
  his parents just got divorced
  and he's really hurting.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.412
  You know, I try to make
  a little more time for him.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.814
   I guess that's what
   friends are for.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.852
 Would you go with me
 to Kelly's party Friday night?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.955
   Oh, wow.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.223
 I'd love to.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.860
 - And how are we here?
 - Great.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.829
   Jessie just invited me
   to a party Friday night.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.300
   ( romantic music plays )

12:25.912 --> 12:28.982
  Whew, is it warm in here,
  or is it me?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.317
   It's you.

12:31.351 --> 12:35.088
I... I have to go back
to the school.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.423
 I'll see you
 Friday night?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.458
   - Be there.
   - Great.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.860
 Bye.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.898
Was that Brett?
He's adorable.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.567
   - He's nice.
   - He's a shrimp.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.537
- So he's kind of short.
- And I'm kind of tall.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.106
   And when you put us together
   we look kind of stupid.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.276
 - But I thought you liked him.
 - I liked him sitting down.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.411
   The date is off.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.218
  All right, look, Screech,
  l have a problem.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.320
   If I don't take
   Belding's niece
   out Friday night,

13:07.354 --> 13:10.323
  l get suspended.
  But Friday night
  is Kelly's birthday party,

13:10.357 --> 13:12.292
  and if I show up with a date,
  she'll dump me.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.594
Yeah, I'd scratch
your eyes out.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.163
 Come here. Look,
 I'm going to do you a favor.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.200
  Last time you did me a favor
  l ended up naked on a bus.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.171
 You had a window seat.
 Right?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.941
  Look,
  Friday night you're going out
  with Belding's niece.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.076
  - I am?
  - Yeah. All you need to do

13:30.076 --> 13:32.946
 is pretend you're me. That way
 I keep Kelly and
 don't get suspended.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.248
   Do I look that desperate
   for a date?

13:38.084 --> 13:41.554
  - What time do I pick her up?
  - Right, that's my Screech.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.157
Everything's going
to work out perfectly.

13:50.263 --> 13:54.668
 It's incredible
 what you can hear
 standing on a toilet.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.777
 That's it, that's it.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.812
   Hey, you're doing great,
   Screech.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.715
 - Just call me Zack.
 - All right now, the jacket.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.217
  One, two...

14:11.251 --> 14:14.254
 three...
 and shoulder!

14:14.287 --> 14:16.790
Now the stance.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.499
 - How's that?
 - Hey, keep smiling.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.706
All right,
now for the big finish.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.308
  You want to open the door
  for her with style.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.778
   Watch me.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.452
 Ooh.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.824
   Go ahead.
   You try.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.829
  - Ahem!
  - Come on.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.405
 Screech!
 Watch out for the...

15:07.040 --> 15:09.042
  - ( thuds )
  - Ooh, aah!

15:10.343 --> 15:12.379
  ...stairs!

15:15.648 --> 15:18.351
  Lisa, what are you doing
  after school today?

15:18.385 --> 15:20.754
 Oh, I'm going
 to my father's country club.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.490
Gee, Kelly, I would
invite you but I can't.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.793
 - Well, why not?
 - New rules. Rich people only.

15:28.762 --> 15:32.665
   - Oh, I understand.
   - Well, I don't.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.434
   Lisa, you would hurt
   someone you like

15:34.467 --> 15:36.403
  because of something
  they have no control over?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.105
   That's exactly the kind
   of small-minded,
   ignorant thing...

15:40.407 --> 15:43.076
 ...that I'm doing to Brett
 because he's short.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.512
  - Good acting, Lisa.
  - Thank you, Kelly.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.547
  I think we made our point
  quite nicely.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.383
 You did.
 I'm going with Brett.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.652
 Good. Let's go to the mall
 and pick up some high heels.

15:52.686 --> 15:55.121
 High heels?
 I'm already too tall.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.791
  They're not for you.
  They're for Brett.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.427
 See you
 at the party tonight.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.029
  Kelly, I can't come.
 <i>Occupado</i> with a babe.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.399
  - Penny Belding.
  - Why don't you bring her?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.034
Sorry, Kelly, I can't.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.036
   I'm going to
   the movies tonight
   with my new fox.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.505
The lights low,
the hopes high,

16:12.539 --> 16:15.041
  the Gummi Bears
  flowing like candy.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.043
 It's magical!

16:17.077 --> 16:20.046
  We'll miss you,
  but have a good time.
  Bye, guys.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.614
 Slater: Bye!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.386
 Wow. Didn't you see
 the pain in her eyes?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.455
 I thought that
 was mascara?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.558
 Oh, no.
 It was pain.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.728
 Pain from not having one
 of her best
 friends at her party.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.064
  - You!
  - You who?

16:38.098 --> 16:41.534
   Oh, you-me.
   Get out of here.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.536
No, Screech, it's true.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.072
  Why don't you go to the movie
  and come to
  the party afterward.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.074
 It would mean a lot to Kelly.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.844
 - You really think so?
 - Trust me.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.879
   If you and Penny Belding
   show up,

16:52.912 --> 16:55.515
 this will be a birthday
 that Kelly will never forget.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.885
 - I'll do it.
 - I love it.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.428
 Are you sure you
 don't want to dance?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.497
   Oh, no thanks.
   I'm a bad dancer.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.665
Lisa thinks you're
a great dancer.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.702
   She also thinks Arsenio Hall
   is where the Lakers play.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.909
   Dateless, Slater?

17:22.942 --> 17:25.744
   For now.
   Enjoy it while
   you can, Preppie.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.481
  Forget it, Slater.
  Tonight is perfect

17:28.515 --> 17:30.517
 and there's nothing
 you can do about it.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.053
Not me... him.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.661
Lisa, this is
Penny Belding.

17:41.695 --> 17:44.798
 Penny, Lisa... my ex.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.967
 How'd you ever let this
 stud muffin get away?

17:48.068 --> 17:51.071
 She's kidding, right?
 What's with the hair?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.840
It's something new.
Do you like it?

17:53.873 --> 17:56.109
 Does the word barf
 mean anything to you?

17:56.142 --> 17:57.510
 Yeah.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.146
Nice meeting you,
Penny.

18:02.148 --> 18:05.151
   That poor girl.
   I think she still
   likes you, Zack.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.054
Oh, she'll get over me.
In a few years!

18:13.126 --> 18:16.229
Uh, Zack?
Could we talk?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.465
   Not now.
   I'm busy with...

18:18.498 --> 18:20.500
  Actually,
  now would be good.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.635
  What are you
  doing here?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.237
  Well, I didn't want
  to ruin the party.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.639
 If you stay,
 you're going to ruin my life.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.675
   And what's with the wig?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.846
   It gives me that extra
   bit of Zackosity.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.048
   I'm going to kick
   your "Zackosity"

18:35.081 --> 18:38.051
if you don't take Penny
and get lost.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.120
  Hi.

18:42.055 --> 18:45.158
   - Who was that?
   - That's my best friend,
   Screech.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.227
 I think he's kind of rude,
 Zack.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.762
  Yeah, he's a dweeb.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.302
If you don't want to dance,
would you mind
if I asked Lisa?

18:56.336 --> 18:59.205
  Sure, go ahead.
  Please go.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.811
Want to dance?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.247
How's it going?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.250
 Not good. Jesse's still
 hung up on this height thing.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.686
   Be right back.
   Don't dance away.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.856
Let's talk.
Dance with me.

19:18.091 --> 19:19.626
   Will you wake up, Jessie?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.194
   You're about to blow it
   with a great guy.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.630
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.570
   - You want to dance?
   - We are dancing.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.639
  Oh, right.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.543
 ( soft music plays )

19:40.080 --> 19:42.115
I have an idea.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.619
   Does this make
   you feel better?

19:46.653 --> 19:48.822
 No, it makes me
 feel stupid.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.090
  Oh.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.061
 I thought this would
 make you feel stupid.

19:55.095 --> 19:57.864
 I'm sorry, Brett.
 I've acted like a real jerk.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.766
  Well, Jessie,
  I am short.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.268
  Yeah, but I'm the one
  who has to grow up.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.604
  Can you ever
  forgive me?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.706
   You're forgiven,
   beanpole.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.775
Thanks, shorty.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.387
Zack needs to
see you right away.
Okay?

20:20.420 --> 20:24.157
   - Be right back, honeybunny.
   - Okay.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.127
 - Hi, I'm Slater.
 - I'm Penny Belding.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.129
 Hey, Penny,
 you see that girl over there?

20:29.162 --> 20:31.297
  That's Kelly.
  It's her birthday.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.333
- That's Kelly?
- Yeah, right.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.069
  Okay, now.
  Her and Zack,
  they're real close.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.104
  I mean, they're like
  brother and sister.

20:38.138 --> 20:39.439
   And it would be
   a great birthday present

20:39.472 --> 20:42.876
 if she heard that you and Zack
 were having
 a good time together.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.878
  - Oh, okay.
  - Come on.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.917
Hey, Kelly,
this is Penny Belding.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.253
 - Hi, I'm glad you could come.
 - Yeah, me too.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.889
Me three. Why don't you two
get to know each other?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.124
 Have fun.
 Talk.

20:58.158 --> 20:59.826
 Are you having
 a good time?

20:59.859 --> 21:02.195
 Oh, yeah. I've met some
 great people tonight.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.330
   Especially Zack.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.399
   Yeah, Zack is nice,
   isn't he?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.868
   Oh, yeah. We've had
   a terrific time together.

21:08.902 --> 21:10.704
   You have?

21:10.737 --> 21:13.139
  Yeah, but we're going
  to be leaving in a minute.

21:13.173 --> 21:14.774
 You and Zack?

21:14.808 --> 21:18.078
   He's so hot.
   He makes my teeth sweat.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.082
But what
about Screech?

21:22.082 --> 21:24.351
He's okay,
if you like that type.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.286
 Zack and I are going back
 to my uncle's house.

21:26.319 --> 21:30.090
   He won't be home for awhile,
   if you know what I mean.

21:32.092 --> 21:34.160
Yes, I know
what you mean,

21:34.194 --> 21:37.197
 you... you...
 un-nice girl!

21:40.100 --> 21:42.168
 All right,
 what a party!

21:45.972 --> 21:47.974
Zack, come on,
let's get out of here.

21:48.008 --> 21:51.344
 These girls are crazy
 about you, and who can
 blame them, my hunk.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.380
   Yeah, babe,
   I got the goods.

21:56.249 --> 21:58.418
   Okay,
   Zack number one.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.955
  Excuse me.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.258
   What's going on?

22:05.759 --> 22:07.727
Well...

22:07.761 --> 22:09.896
you know how Screech always
wanted to be like me?

22:09.929 --> 22:14.067
 Zack!
 Tell me. Now.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.503
   Would you believe we're on
   "Totally Hidden Videos"?

22:16.536 --> 22:18.738
 This is good.

22:18.772 --> 22:21.741
 Did you tell Belding
 you'd go out with his niece?

22:21.775 --> 22:24.077
 Yeah, I did.

22:24.077 --> 22:27.514
   Zack Morris, I will never
   forget this birthday as
   long as I live.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.183
- I should be furious.
- Go with the feeling.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.189
   I don't know anyone else
   who would go to
   all this trouble

22:36.222 --> 22:39.092
 just to make me happy.
 Thanks, Zack.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.128
 Hey...
 I knew you'd like it.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.899
 Ooh.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.141
 ( instrumental music plays )
