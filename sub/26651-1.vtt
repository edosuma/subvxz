00:16.120 --> 00:19.000

security of South Africa,

00:19.400 --> 00:22.280
President Botha has extended
the state of emergency

00:22.640 --> 00:24.880
until peace and order can be restored,

00:25.240 --> 00:27.640
allowing the president to rule by decree,

00:28.040 --> 00:30.840

Our shipment's stuck in customs.
Nothing we can do.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.640

Unfortunately,
there has been a change of plans.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.640

You? Are you planning to demo
the latest technology yourself, are you?

03:21.840 --> 03:25.360
Bring me the correct paperwork
and my missiles under your arm, Ms. Neid.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.720

Comrades! I don't have to tell you

07:24.640 --> 07:27.520
is facing unprecedented
economic challenges.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.920
We're deep in debt to the West,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.960
and the East German mark
is worthless internationally.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.200
We must bring in hard currency.
Or we're doomed, Comrades.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.440

Mrs. Dietrich.

We've already significantly reduced the
average age of this board

07:52.040 --> 07:54.600
with our Young Professionals Program.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.440
Now Mrs. Dietrich will help us
to develop a new business initiative.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.640
I like to think of it as a
"Special Commission."

08:02.000 --> 08:07.160
Not unlike the classified missions
you spies are usually up to.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.280
Our work here will also be
classified top secret.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.160
But rather than simply gathering data,

08:16.240 --> 08:20.680
we will look for new ways to
turn that data into... profit.

08:22.240 --> 08:26.000
East Germany is expensive.
And that's not because we're greedy.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.160
It's because equality is expensive.
Our ideals are expensive,

08:31.520 --> 08:34.720
and it's up to government organizations
such as ours

08:34.800 --> 08:37.680
to support these ideals efficiently.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.480
Because Moscow is abandoning us?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.600
Comrade...

08:45.240 --> 08:46.520
Schneider.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.960
Comrade Schneider.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.680
If your neighbor decides
to tear off her wallpaper,

08:53.760 --> 08:55.560
just for a change of scenery,

08:56.880 --> 09:00.560
does that mean that you do the same?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.400
Well...

09:07.040 --> 09:09.480
I'd only change my wallpaper if...

09:10.360 --> 09:14.400
if I was deeply convinced of
the advantages of doing so.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.080
With this Special Commission,
the HVA will fund companies

09:22.160 --> 09:25.200
licensed to do business internationally

09:25.440 --> 09:27.800
and bring in new streams
of hard currency from abroad.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.160
It sounds like you're
talking about Capitalism.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
Comrade Schneider!

09:31.320 --> 09:36.560
I'm talking about defending this country
by any means necessary.

09:36.640 --> 09:41.600
I'll keep a close eye on the numbers.
Be warned: the numbers never lie.

09:42.840 --> 09:47.600
The numbers go up... we survive.
The numbers go down... we go under.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.880

can I speak with you a moment?

10:06.960 --> 10:08.040
Yes.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.200
I don't think we've had the pleasure...

10:10.760 --> 10:11.960
Correct.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.040
See you tomorrow?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.320
Yes, certainly.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.520
Who was that?

10:17.760 --> 10:20.000
Barbara Dietrich from KoKo.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.600
I met her on the South Africa project.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.680
Now we're heading up an
integrated business initiative.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.280
She calls it a "Special Commission."

10:28.680 --> 10:29.760
She's very, very efficient.

10:29.840 --> 10:30.920
Efficient.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.760
That means she makes
the most of given resources.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.640
Or rather: she achieves
defined goals with minimum means.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.040
She'll change East Germany completely.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.120
I see.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.640
I would love to be on this
"Special Commission."

10:45.840 --> 10:48.520
