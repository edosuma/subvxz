Protect the freight, come on!

02:05.521 --> 02:06.561
Move, move!

02:06.721 --> 02:07.881
Protect the wagon!

02:08.041 --> 02:09.041
Come on, quick!

02:09.080 --> 02:10.481
Come on, come on!

02:12.961 --> 02:14.521
Quick!

02:17.041 --> 02:18.481
There's no one here, sir.

03:29.081 --> 03:33.481
GUN CITY

03:47.721 --> 03:50.001
Clear the scaffolds!

04:03.481 --> 04:05.841
MZA train held up and robbed!

04:06.001 --> 04:10.761
Anarchist suspects
rounded up by police!

04:10.961 --> 04:12.201
Read all about it in <i>La Voz!</i>

04:12.361 --> 04:13.681
War in Africa!

04:13.841 --> 04:18.721
Abd El-Krim rebels
attack our positions in the Rif!

04:21.241 --> 04:23.601
MZA train held up and robbed!

04:23.761 --> 04:28.361
Anarchist suspects
rounded up by police!

04:28.961 --> 04:32.641
Abd El-Krim rebels
attack our positions in the Rif!

04:32.841 --> 04:33.921
Read <i>La Voz!</i>

04:37.281 --> 04:39.417
- He hasn't done anything wrong!
- Don't raise your voice.

04:39.441 --> 04:40.961
Let him go!

04:41.161 --> 04:44.001
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Nothing to worry about?

04:44.241 --> 04:45.881
I just need to know
that he's alright!

04:46.041 --> 04:47.041
No, please!

04:47.201 --> 04:50.001
Let me see my husband,
I just need to know he's alright.

04:50.201 --> 04:52.201
Please, please!

04:54.001 --> 04:55.281
Commissioner Verdaguer?

04:55.721 --> 04:56.881
Who wants him?

05:04.361 --> 05:06.497
The Commissioner had to go
to see the Military Governor.

05:06.521 --> 05:09.761
They're climbing the walls about
the MZA train robbery.

05:09.921 --> 05:11.601
So who's in charge?

05:11.761 --> 05:15.081
Inspector Rediú, first floor,
end of the corridor.

05:16.401 --> 05:17.601
Thank you.

05:20.801 --> 05:22.001
No! No!

05:22.201 --> 05:24.441
- Talk!
- No!

05:24.601 --> 05:26.321
- Talk, damn it!
- You coward!

05:28.601 --> 05:30.721
Stay there. Leave it me.

05:38.761 --> 05:40.841
Talk, damn it! Talk!

05:41.001 --> 05:42.081
Come on.

05:42.361 --> 05:44.041
Stop whimpering.
Confess.

05:44.241 --> 05:46.921
What was in the boxes?
Where did you hide them?

05:47.081 --> 05:49.081
- I don't know anything, I swear.
- You don't know?

05:53.601 --> 05:55.441
Do you take us for idiots?

05:56.441 --> 05:59.321
We know perfectly well
you were in on the train robbery.

05:59.641 --> 06:02.041
No, no! I didn't do anything.

06:02.241 --> 06:04.161
"I didn't do anything..."

06:04.361 --> 06:05.921
No, no.

06:18.761 --> 06:20.401
He's passed out.

06:20.761 --> 06:22.161
Shit.

06:29.481 --> 06:30.961
Who the fuck are you?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.401
Aníbal Uriarte,
Information Brigade, Madrid.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.761
Perfect...

06:42.361 --> 06:44.721
I ask for twenty men and I get one...

06:44.881 --> 06:47.361
That's this country for you.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.641
Aníbal Uriarte...

06:50.801 --> 06:54.641
I thought you Basques
had big paunches and bigger heads.

06:54.801 --> 06:55.801
Boss...

06:56.401 --> 06:58.161
He's coming to.

07:02.761 --> 07:05.841
He's the MZA train driver.

07:06.921 --> 07:09.601
We think he had something to do
with the robbery,

07:09.761 --> 07:11.361
but the bastard won't talk.

07:13.321 --> 07:15.561
Let's take him out
for some fresh air.

07:15.721 --> 07:17.041
Come on.

07:17.241 --> 07:18.761
Come on!

07:19.361 --> 07:21.441
You come too, Basque.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.721
You'll get to see
how things work around here.

07:32.441 --> 07:34.681
Come on, come on!

07:36.521 --> 07:38.281
Move up the sheaves.

07:53.481 --> 07:55.601
This is your last chance to confess.

07:55.881 --> 07:57.481
Tell us where those boxes are.

07:57.641 --> 07:58.641
I don't know...

07:58.761 --> 08:00.561
Truly, I don't.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.801
Why don't you talk, uh?

08:10.201 --> 08:12.321
Why don't you talk?

08:20.201 --> 08:21.841
Fucking stand up.

08:23.561 --> 08:25.521
Alright, alright...

08:25.681 --> 08:31.361
Give us something, a name,
an address, something.

08:31.841 --> 08:33.081
Something!

08:36.760 --> 08:38.241
You're not going to talk then?

08:38.400 --> 08:42.681
One of those anarchists with principles.

08:42.961 --> 08:44.241
Bastards!

08:45.241 --> 08:46.721
Bastards!

08:50.801 --> 08:52.641
T.B.!

08:58.041 --> 08:59.681
Let the Basque do it.

09:21.881 --> 09:26.801
Well, gents, let's have some fun,
this looks like a funeral.

09:26.961 --> 09:30.041
It's not all work,
right, T.B.?

09:30.241 --> 09:32.321
I'll go get the shovel.

09:32.481 --> 09:33.921
Welcome to Barcelona.

10:06.001 --> 10:08.441
What's up, Jordi?
You look skinny.

10:08.601 --> 10:10.961
- The Baron does not feed me.
- Your mother should!

10:11.161 --> 10:13.401
Good night, Jordi.

10:16.321 --> 10:21.601
Basque, this is the best club
in the city, in the whole country!

10:23.401 --> 10:25.041
This way, this way.

10:27.281 --> 10:30.281
I slept with them last night.

10:33.641 --> 10:36.241
Ladies, good evening.

10:40.241 --> 10:43.841
Where are you going?
Where are you going with him?

10:46.001 --> 10:47.721
These ones are new?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.561
Inspector Rediú,
a pleasure to see you here!

10:57.561 --> 11:00.361
You know that even if we're full
there's always a table

11:00.521 --> 11:02.201
for our friends
in the Information Brigade.

11:02.321 --> 11:03.801
Thank you, Gastón.

11:12.041 --> 11:13.601
What about this one?

11:13.761 --> 11:15.961
He's too young for you.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.521
María, the guys from
the Information Brigade are here!

11:44.681 --> 11:45.441
Can you help me?

11:45.601 --> 11:47.721
Lola, we're on! Come on!

11:48.961 --> 11:51.321
- Where's the glitter?
- It's here, there you go.

11:52.881 --> 11:56.361
Come on, boys, come on!

12:17.801 --> 12:19.321
<i>Les Papillons.</i>

12:19.481 --> 12:21.041
These French butterflies

12:21.241 --> 12:24.721
come right from the best theaters
in Paris!

12:26.761 --> 12:29.241
A round of applause for them!

12:33.361 --> 12:36.041
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for!

12:36.241 --> 12:40.721
With you here tonight,
the great Lola Montaner!

12:47.961 --> 12:49.561
You're beautiful!

13:05.761 --> 13:10.681
<i>I have a little flea in my blouse</i>

13:10.841 --> 13:14.841
<i>that hops like crazy all around.</i>

13:15.001 --> 13:19.401
<i>So I want to catch him some day,</i>

13:19.561 --> 13:23.481
<i>and if I do, he's going to pay.</i>

13:24.241 --> 13:27.761
<i>Jumping fast and hiding away,</i>

13:27.921 --> 13:32.081
<i>where he bit me I cannot say.</i>

13:32.281 --> 13:36.321
<i>Hopping mad, if I find him,</i>

13:36.481 --> 13:39.641
<i>I'll give him what I should.</i>

13:39.801 --> 13:42.321
I'll repay you,
plus interest, I swear.

13:42.481 --> 13:44.041
I swear.

13:44.641 --> 13:47.361
But I need another three months.

13:52.921 --> 13:55.361
Martin, I see only two solutions.

13:55.521 --> 13:58.321
Either I exercise the default clause

13:58.481 --> 14:01.201
and keep your hardware store...

14:01.361 --> 14:03.361
No, please, not that.

14:03.521 --> 14:06.281
I inherited it from my father.

14:06.441 --> 14:09.001
It's the only property we own.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.041
What's the other solution?

14:12.801 --> 14:16.241
The other solution...
Look who's here!

14:16.401 --> 14:17.841
What's going on, Dad?

14:19.041 --> 14:21.801
What a pretty girl!
What's your name?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.961
- Laura.
- Laura. How old are you?

14:24.161 --> 14:25.361
Thirteen.

14:26.641 --> 14:28.201
Do you like to sing and dance?

14:28.361 --> 14:31.001
- Yes.
- Good, good.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.801
Baron, she's just a girl.

14:34.641 --> 14:39.361
No, she's a young woman,
right, Majorcan?

14:41.201 --> 14:43.001
She's a young woman, yes.

14:43.201 --> 14:44.801
A young woman.

14:44.961 --> 14:49.481
<i>So you might see no more.</i>

14:56.161 --> 14:57.841
Take it all out, love!

14:58.001 --> 15:02.241
<i>That's it, he's in my hands,</i>

15:02.401 --> 15:05.481
<i>and I killed him, that's for sure.</i>

15:07.601 --> 15:10.321
The great Lola Montaner!

15:13.441 --> 15:17.281
<i>Now we leave you
with a musical interlude.</i>

15:18.521 --> 15:21.161
Good evening,
what can I get you to drink?

15:21.321 --> 15:22.841
A kiss for my favorite.

15:26.161 --> 15:27.441
That was after Paris.

15:27.601 --> 15:31.161
Basque, I don't know what
it's like in Madrid,

15:31.321 --> 15:34.641
but we can't keep abreast
here in Barcelona.

15:36.641 --> 15:40.041
Every day we have more work,
fewer men,

15:41.481 --> 15:43.481
and the same shitty salary.
Don't we, T.B.?

15:47.881 --> 15:52.041
He spends all his wages on whores.
They remind him of his mother.

15:52.241 --> 15:54.481
What are you doing?

16:03.481 --> 16:05.481
Nicanor, nice to see you so well.

16:06.681 --> 16:09.561
Inspector Rediú and company.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.401
Welcome to Eden.

16:11.561 --> 16:13.361
Everything to your liking?

16:13.521 --> 16:16.961
Isn't that the hardware store guy
from the Borne?

16:17.721 --> 16:19.321
Yes,

16:19.521 --> 16:21.441
he's looking for a spot
for his daughter

16:21.601 --> 16:23.201
and he asked me to lend him a hand.

16:23.361 --> 16:25.281
Isn't she too young to work here?

16:26.561 --> 16:29.881
I know you prefer
ripe fruit, Inspector,

16:30.641 --> 16:33.561
but I have clients with other tastes.

16:33.721 --> 16:34.801
You mean like yours?

16:35.801 --> 16:37.241
You should try it some time.

16:39.641 --> 16:43.481
Widen your palate to other delicacies.

16:43.641 --> 16:45.801
No, I'm a...

16:45.961 --> 16:48.601
a traditionalist.

16:48.761 --> 16:49.961
Right.

16:50.161 --> 16:53.441
Any rumors about the MZA train robbery?

16:55.001 --> 16:56.001
You hear lots of things:

16:56.961 --> 17:01.081
that it held the gold reserve
of the Bank of Spain,

17:01.281 --> 17:04.961
that the thieves
were French anarchists...

17:05.601 --> 17:08.080
- Actually, nobody knows.
- Right.

17:08.281 --> 17:11.641
But don't worry, if I hear anything
you'll be the first to know.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.401
Alright.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.721
Enjoy the night.

17:20.800 --> 17:25.161
He says he's the bastard son
of a German nobleman.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.560
But he's a bullshit merchant
in on every racket in town.

17:28.721 --> 17:30.281
Bastard, son of a bitch.

17:30.441 --> 17:33.161
An invert, a monstrosity.
You want to slit his guts.

17:33.321 --> 17:34.881
Courtesy of the Baron.

17:37.201 --> 17:38.441
I take back what I said.

17:39.561 --> 17:40.761
Hello, handsome.

17:41.601 --> 17:42.641
Come here, princess.

17:42.801 --> 17:44.561
Aren't you hot?

17:44.721 --> 17:46.961
Yes, what?

17:48.161 --> 17:51.561
French from where?
From where?

17:51.721 --> 17:53.761
- Paris.
- Shut up.

17:56.881 --> 17:58.801
Or the triple...

17:59.641 --> 18:01.081
The Baron likes it.

18:01.961 --> 18:03.401
Do you have a light?

18:05.881 --> 18:07.201
Didn't you like our girls?

18:09.041 --> 18:10.761
First time I've seen you around here.

18:11.761 --> 18:13.001
I just got into town.

18:13.201 --> 18:14.961
You better watch out then.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.801
Barcelona is a dangerous place
for cops.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.281
I hear business is booming.

18:22.481 --> 18:23.881
Ask your boss,

18:24.041 --> 18:25.961
I'm sure he can give you
all the advice you need.

18:26.161 --> 18:27.161
Basque!

18:32.241 --> 18:34.001
I'd rather get rich on my own.

18:43.401 --> 18:46.081
You'll soon feel right at home.
You'll see.

20:38.561 --> 20:39.601
War in Africa!

20:40.521 --> 20:42.161
Read all about it in <i>El Sol!</i>

20:43.241 --> 20:45.241
Here you are.

20:46.641 --> 20:48.001
Thank you.

20:48.201 --> 20:49.561
War in Africa!

20:49.721 --> 20:52.241
Spanish troops
besieged by rebels in Annual!

20:52.401 --> 20:53.481
Read it in <i>El Sol!</i>

20:54.561 --> 20:58.041
"Early estimates talk of
dozens of casualties..."

20:58.681 --> 21:02.161
If they're saying dozens,
that means hundreds are dying.

21:05.161 --> 21:06.801
This can't go on.

21:06.961 --> 21:07.961
No!

21:08.001 --> 21:10.561
We work as much as men,
why don't we get the same pay?

21:10.721 --> 21:11.921
That's right!

21:12.081 --> 21:15.561
We have the same duties,
why don't we have the same rights?

21:15.721 --> 21:16.721
Why?

21:16.801 --> 21:18.481
- We want equality!
- Equality!

21:18.641 --> 21:21.081
Equal rights and equal wages!

21:21.321 --> 21:22.481
Equality!

21:22.641 --> 21:24.481
We've had enough of shutting up
and taking it!

21:24.641 --> 21:25.641
Enough!

21:26.001 --> 21:28.361
In Barcelona, we hold
the world record for strikes.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.441
There were over six hundred last year.

21:30.721 --> 21:32.081
Six hundred.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.761
Enough of putting up
with abuse and discrimination!

21:34.921 --> 21:36.161
It's time for action!

21:36.681 --> 21:37.961
We want equality!

21:38.161 --> 21:39.161
Equality!

21:39.321 --> 21:40.921
- Equality!
- Equality!

21:41.081 --> 21:42.881
- Equality!
- Equality...

21:43.041 --> 21:44.841
They'll have to listen to us!

21:47.521 --> 21:49.481
Equality...

21:49.921 --> 21:51.601
Equality?

21:51.761 --> 21:53.457
They want equality?
They're going to get it.

21:53.481 --> 21:55.321
Today they're in for it
just like the men,

21:55.481 --> 21:56.321
or worse.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.761
All together they will listen to us!

21:59.721 --> 22:00.961
Equality!

22:01.601 --> 22:02.721
Equality!

22:02.881 --> 22:04.441
Equality!

22:12.561 --> 22:14.041
Come on, surround them!

22:14.241 --> 22:15.841
No! No!

22:23.081 --> 22:24.641
No! No!

22:35.961 --> 22:37.561
Let her go!

22:38.321 --> 22:39.721
No, no!

22:52.201 --> 22:53.401
No! No!

23:05.401 --> 23:06.441
Gentlemen,

23:06.961 --> 23:10.041
the MZA train was carrying
a consignment of army weapons.

23:10.961 --> 23:12.961
Governor Martinez Anido
has demanded

23:13.161 --> 23:15.281
the immediate arrest
of the perpetrators.

23:17.001 --> 23:19.641
If we don't get those guns back
in 72 hours,

23:20.401 --> 23:22.641
he'll bring the troops
out onto the streets.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.321
We have to act urgently.

23:25.281 --> 23:27.481
If the anarchists begin
to use those weapons,

23:29.041 --> 23:30.961
the city will become
a powder keg...

23:34.081 --> 23:35.601
Be very careful.

23:40.161 --> 23:41.481
Where's the engine driver?

23:41.961 --> 23:44.001
Sir, he was hurt...

23:44.201 --> 23:46.401
He tried to escape on our way
to the hospital...

23:46.561 --> 23:48.241
Do you take me for a fool?

23:49.041 --> 23:51.761
He tried to escape,
so we applied the Escape Law.

23:53.521 --> 23:54.601
Who are you?

23:55.921 --> 23:58.201
Aníbal Uriarte.
I got here from Madrid.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.641
That law is an aberration,

24:02.521 --> 24:05.481
and I will not allow it
in this police station.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.601
He was a dangerous anarchist.

24:07.761 --> 24:09.801
We're policemen,

24:10.081 --> 24:11.881
not common thugs.

24:13.241 --> 24:16.201
We have to put an end to violence,
not encourage it.

24:18.721 --> 24:21.321
Find me those damned guns,

24:21.641 --> 24:23.961
but be discreet and effective.

24:25.161 --> 24:26.361
Is that clear?

24:26.521 --> 24:27.921
Yes, sir.

24:28.081 --> 24:30.801
At your command, Commissioner.

24:35.801 --> 24:37.561
You have no right!

24:37.801 --> 24:41.681
It was a peaceful protest
and they treated us like animals!

24:41.881 --> 24:43.321
Miss! Miss!

24:43.481 --> 24:45.761
The police says you began
the confrontation

24:45.921 --> 24:47.001
with your violent attitude.

24:47.041 --> 24:48.761
It's a lie! Write that!

24:48.921 --> 24:51.161
We were protesting for our rights

24:51.321 --> 24:52.521
and they sent their horses!

24:52.681 --> 24:53.801
There are injured girls!

24:53.961 --> 24:55.601
Leave, please.
Leave!

24:55.761 --> 24:56.961
Leave!

24:57.321 --> 24:58.961
No, no!

25:01.481 --> 25:02.761
That's enough.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.361
Let them go!

25:39.921 --> 25:43.361
I'm gonna beat the hell out of
that son of a bitch.

25:58.961 --> 26:00.161
Let's go.

26:16.081 --> 26:17.881
Out, out, out!

26:18.041 --> 26:19.921
Out, out, out!

26:21.201 --> 26:23.161
Out, damn it!

26:23.321 --> 26:25.481
Come on, darling.
Forget that, come on.

26:32.281 --> 26:34.321
Alright, ladies,

26:34.481 --> 26:37.161
hands on the counter.

26:37.321 --> 26:39.401
We only take orders from the Baron.

26:41.481 --> 26:43.801
You'll do as I say!

27:07.361 --> 27:10.161
Come here! Come here!

27:23.641 --> 27:24.721
You faggot!

27:31.161 --> 27:33.681
The Baron's not going to like this.

27:37.401 --> 27:39.441
Tell the Baron

27:40.321 --> 27:42.441
that cognac and whores
are always appreciated.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.561
But we have a deal
and he's not sticking to it.

27:58.801 --> 28:00.561
Here, kid, count this.

28:02.401 --> 28:03.401
Let's go.

28:06.761 --> 28:07.761
Basque,

28:07.841 --> 28:10.041
where'd you learn to fight like that?

28:10.241 --> 28:11.481
Morocco.

28:11.961 --> 28:13.081
In the war?

28:15.001 --> 28:16.961
We've got a hero among us,

28:17.161 --> 28:18.721
a hero.

28:28.841 --> 28:29.841
Camera...

28:30.881 --> 28:32.681
and action!

28:33.241 --> 28:36.481
We have two beautiful nymphs.

28:37.401 --> 28:39.561
Two beauties...

28:39.721 --> 28:42.361
Lola, whisper in little Laura's ear.

28:43.201 --> 28:44.961
Tell her something,
what you're going to do.

28:45.161 --> 28:49.441
What you're going to do...
That's it, good.

28:51.881 --> 28:53.641
- Baron.
- I'm working.

28:57.881 --> 28:59.321
Cut.

28:59.481 --> 29:00.841
Put this on.

29:01.001 --> 29:02.001
What is it?

29:02.041 --> 29:03.041
Rediú.

29:03.161 --> 29:04.921
- I don't want to.
- I know, honey.

29:05.081 --> 29:06.601
Nothing will happen to you with me.

29:06.761 --> 29:08.601
Everyone in my office in five minutes.

29:12.401 --> 29:14.401
Girls, that's all for today.

29:16.161 --> 29:17.161
We'll carry on other day.

29:17.481 --> 29:20.241
Laura, give this to your father.

29:20.761 --> 29:22.081
Here.

29:22.281 --> 29:24.161
You'll see how happy it makes him.

29:33.881 --> 29:35.641
Councillor Folch called today.

29:35.961 --> 29:37.601
He says he wants to see you again.

29:37.801 --> 29:38.801
Baron.

29:38.921 --> 29:41.881
I know when he drinks,
he goes overboard.

29:42.401 --> 29:46.241
But you never complain when
he goes overboard with the gifts.

29:47.361 --> 29:48.561
I'm pregnant.

29:50.401 --> 29:51.641
Again?

29:52.921 --> 29:54.321
The office worker?

29:54.481 --> 29:56.001
This time it's different.

29:56.201 --> 29:58.161
He's asked me to marry him.

29:58.321 --> 30:00.161
And to leave Eden.

30:04.961 --> 30:06.921
Girl, you're the star of Eden.

30:07.081 --> 30:08.801
I know and I'm sorry, Baron.

30:08.961 --> 30:11.241
But I'm in love.

30:13.881 --> 30:15.321
You're in love?

30:17.001 --> 30:19.721
The second-rate chorus girl
I turned into a star,

30:19.881 --> 30:22.881
in whom I invested my time,
my work, my money, my effort,

30:23.041 --> 30:24.161
has fallen in love.

30:24.321 --> 30:27.361
And probably she's going to say
she's leaving me, right?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.561
Yes.

30:33.401 --> 30:35.081
No.

30:36.721 --> 30:38.321
The Majorcan
will talk to the doctor.

30:38.481 --> 30:39.961
- And that's that.
- No.

30:40.161 --> 30:41.561
- That's that.
- No.

30:41.721 --> 30:42.961
Baron, it's my child.

30:43.161 --> 30:44.721
That's that!

30:46.881 --> 30:48.201
I'm not doing it again.

30:48.561 --> 30:50.681
You have a date with
Councillor Folch tonight.

30:50.841 --> 30:52.241
No.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.201
What did I tell you, Basque?

31:07.361 --> 31:09.281
The world record in strikes.

31:14.961 --> 31:17.481
Go round the back,
I don't want any problems.

31:29.761 --> 31:31.441
- What did we get?
- Nothing.

31:31.601 --> 31:34.041
This strike doesn't make any sense.

31:34.241 --> 31:35.441
Where are you going?

31:35.601 --> 31:36.761
We're tired.

31:37.081 --> 31:39.801
We're wasting our time here.
We achieved nothing.

31:39.961 --> 31:42.321
You know what you'll achieve
if you leave now?

31:42.961 --> 31:45.241
Trash the effort
of all these people.

31:45.401 --> 31:48.761
So stop acting like an idiot
and go back to your spot.

31:48.921 --> 31:49.961
I can't.

31:50.961 --> 31:52.801
- Let go of me!
- You're not leaving now.

31:53.001 --> 31:54.881
I can't take it anymore,
I have to feed my kids.

31:54.961 --> 31:57.801
We've all got it rough,
but no one's giving up here.

31:57.961 --> 31:59.161
Let him go.

31:59.561 --> 32:00.961
Let him go!

32:10.161 --> 32:12.401
If you want to go back...

32:12.761 --> 32:14.961
If you want to go back to work,

32:15.161 --> 32:16.801
we won't stop you.

32:17.641 --> 32:18.841
Or anyone.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.601
They'll never give in, Salvador.

32:22.161 --> 32:23.241
Never.

32:23.401 --> 32:24.441
They will give in!

32:25.001 --> 32:27.841
This factory can't function without us.

32:28.201 --> 32:32.321
Manuel, if they don't, the factory
will go broke and they'll be ruined.

32:32.481 --> 32:33.921
Don't you understand?

32:34.081 --> 32:36.081
We're so close to achieving this.

32:36.681 --> 32:39.921
If we resist, we'll win.

32:40.561 --> 32:42.241
I assure you, Manuel.

32:47.681 --> 32:49.561
Get out! Get out!

33:16.161 --> 33:18.161
I want the names of everyone there.

33:18.321 --> 33:20.321
- This is a disgrace.
- Yes, sir.

33:20.841 --> 33:22.241
Who are they?

33:22.401 --> 33:24.841
Don Emilio, they come
from the Information Brigade.

33:25.041 --> 33:28.001
They want to talk about the robbery
of the Madrid express train.

33:29.601 --> 33:31.801
You're the ones responsible.

33:32.921 --> 33:35.961
If the police acted firmly
against the anarchists,

33:36.161 --> 33:37.761
the robbery
would never have happened.

33:37.921 --> 33:39.321
We do what we can.

33:39.481 --> 33:40.561
Not enough.

33:41.641 --> 33:44.361
Alright, what do you want to know?

33:45.041 --> 33:47.401
We think some of your workers

33:47.561 --> 33:49.721
were part of the group
that did the train job.

33:53.841 --> 33:57.561
Here's a list of all of the workers
at this factory who are anarchists.

34:00.401 --> 34:02.801
Were all of them aware of
the train's cargo?

34:02.961 --> 34:04.041
Of course not.

34:04.241 --> 34:05.961
We were the only ones
with that information.

34:06.601 --> 34:07.601
And Guillem.

34:08.601 --> 34:09.601
Our accountant.

34:11.161 --> 34:14.161
- And where's this Guillem?
- He hasn't come to work today.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.880
Where can we find him?

34:19.960 --> 34:21.761
This is his address.

34:25.201 --> 34:27.161
Many thanks for your time.

34:45.761 --> 34:47.161
Salvador.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.400
Don Emilio wants to see you.

34:53.321 --> 34:54.321
Do you want to see me?

34:59.881 --> 35:02.281
It's a friendly way
of solving this dispute.

35:04.881 --> 35:06.841
This dispute will be solved

35:07.721 --> 35:10.241
when you stop forcing us
to work 10 hours a day,

35:10.961 --> 35:13.081
stop hiring minors,

35:13.281 --> 35:15.161
and finally give us all a pay rise.

35:19.641 --> 35:20.961
Don't you people realize?

35:22.081 --> 35:23.761
This country is in crisis.

35:24.481 --> 35:26.641
Production's gone down,
taxes keep rising.

35:27.361 --> 35:29.881
A pay rise would put
this factory out of business.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.641
Don't take us for idiots.

35:33.761 --> 35:36.561
This factory made millions
during the War.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.041
You got rich, just like your father,

35:40.161 --> 35:41.921
but we're still just as poor.

35:42.081 --> 35:43.881
Don't talk to me like that!

35:46.361 --> 35:48.361
Our demands are fair.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.361
If you don't go back to work,
I'll have to take drastic measures.

35:53.441 --> 35:55.681
If you don't listen to our demands,

35:56.561 --> 35:59.081
we'll stay on strike indefinitely.

36:01.681 --> 36:02.681
Get out.

36:14.481 --> 36:15.881
Have you seen Elisa?

36:17.641 --> 36:19.441
Any news of Elisa?

36:20.761 --> 36:22.217
- Please, have you seen Elisa?
- Mother...

36:22.241 --> 36:24.361
Wretch, worse than a wretch.

36:24.521 --> 36:26.777
- Do you know what you put us through?
- Mother, please...

36:26.801 --> 36:27.881
Have you seen Elisa?

36:29.041 --> 36:30.281
This is all your fault!

36:30.921 --> 36:33.641
It should've been you
and not that poor creature.

36:33.801 --> 36:34.801
What happened?

36:35.201 --> 36:36.321
How is Elisa?

36:37.321 --> 36:38.321
Go away.

36:38.961 --> 36:41.081
Stay away from my daughter.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.721
- What happened?
- Let's go.

36:43.881 --> 36:45.161
How is Elisa?

36:46.321 --> 36:47.721
Let's go home.

36:57.001 --> 36:58.401
Police!

36:58.561 --> 37:01.161
Everybody go home,
this gathering is over.

37:01.641 --> 37:03.601
Go. Get out of here.

37:38.161 --> 37:39.961
It's the accountant.

37:47.481 --> 37:50.961
Well, it seems the accountant
liked chorus girls.

38:30.561 --> 38:33.641
No, no, no, no!

38:35.361 --> 38:37.561
No, no!

38:49.601 --> 38:53.161
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

38:54.401 --> 38:55.961
This is my fault.

38:56.161 --> 38:59.721
I convinced her. I'm sorry.

39:05.961 --> 39:07.761
This is not your fault.

39:07.921 --> 39:09.401
It was them.

39:12.161 --> 39:13.921
They killed my baby girl.

39:14.601 --> 39:16.401
You have to keep fighting.

39:17.241 --> 39:19.161
Don't give up.

39:33.361 --> 39:37.161
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.001
I'm sorry.

40:03.361 --> 40:05.161
I'm so sorry.

40:11.361 --> 40:13.001
It was a peaceful protest.

40:13.201 --> 40:14.201
I know.

40:15.201 --> 40:16.641
I know.

40:34.961 --> 40:36.441
Let me talk to her mother.

40:52.801 --> 40:54.241
I'm so sorry about Elisa.

40:57.561 --> 40:58.961
We have guns.

41:00.641 --> 41:02.361
And we're going to act.

41:20.041 --> 41:22.321
Salvador Ortiz.
I need a solution.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.001
That's what you'll get.

41:24.201 --> 41:26.201
I'll pay you half now

41:26.361 --> 41:28.401
and the other half
when the job is done.

41:32.161 --> 41:36.321
You know I've been a while
trying to join the Liceo.

41:36.481 --> 41:37.321
The Liceo, yes.

41:37.481 --> 41:41.161
I keep running into a wall
of incomprehension

41:41.321 --> 41:43.281
and provincialism.

41:43.601 --> 41:45.161
What you're asking isn't easy.

41:45.321 --> 41:46.161
I know.

41:46.321 --> 41:48.201
- It doesn't just depend on me.
- I know.

41:49.761 --> 41:52.721
But if you could lend me a hand,

41:52.881 --> 41:54.881
I'd be eternally grateful.

41:55.281 --> 41:59.281
And, of course, I'd charge nothing
for this service.

41:59.481 --> 42:02.641
Baron, the Information Brigade
are downstairs.

42:04.401 --> 42:05.721
I'll be right back.

42:05.881 --> 42:07.721
No, I have to go.

42:08.281 --> 42:09.721
But don't worry,

42:10.401 --> 42:12.161
I'll talk to my colleagues.

42:13.401 --> 42:15.041
Thank you so much.

42:16.841 --> 42:19.481
Evening, ladies!
Everybody out! Now!

42:19.641 --> 42:20.681
Out, damn it!

42:22.161 --> 42:22.881
Come on!

42:23.041 --> 42:24.241
Out, out!

42:27.401 --> 42:29.921
- We want to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

42:32.561 --> 42:34.481
We think it was...

42:34.641 --> 42:36.641
your boyfriend

42:37.321 --> 42:40.721
who tipped off the gang
who robbed the MZA train.

42:42.481 --> 42:43.761
I need names.

42:47.841 --> 42:49.601
Are you deaf, you little whore?

42:51.401 --> 42:52.641
Don't touch me!

42:55.801 --> 42:57.241
Who were his friends?

42:58.201 --> 42:59.761
I don't know what you're talking about.

43:00.041 --> 43:01.521
Why not ask Guillem?

43:02.481 --> 43:04.561
Your boyfriend can't talk anymore.

43:05.521 --> 43:07.201
- What?
- T.B., Consumptive!

43:07.361 --> 43:08.561
T.B.!

43:11.761 --> 43:13.881
Miss Lola,

43:14.041 --> 43:17.201
just give us the names
of his anarchist friends

43:17.361 --> 43:18.961
and we'll leave you alone.

43:19.161 --> 43:20.761
Guillem isn't an anarchist.

43:22.041 --> 43:23.481
What are you doing in here?

43:24.481 --> 43:26.961
Just talking to the lady.

43:27.161 --> 43:28.241
Let go of her!

43:28.401 --> 43:29.401
Let go I said!

43:30.881 --> 43:32.041
T.B.

43:39.441 --> 43:41.721
You're not telling me
how to do my job.

43:41.881 --> 43:43.041
You and your men get out

43:43.241 --> 43:45.761
or I'll call Governor Martinez Anido.

43:46.441 --> 43:49.281
I'm sure the Governor
has more important things to do.

43:49.681 --> 43:50.881
Shall we find out?

43:56.681 --> 43:58.001
Baron, we had a deal:

43:58.521 --> 44:00.361
You take care of paybacks

44:00.521 --> 44:01.937
and we deal with the bars
and businesses.

44:01.961 --> 44:03.001
Where is he?

44:03.201 --> 44:04.201
The deal expired.

44:04.321 --> 44:05.801
Get out.

44:05.961 --> 44:07.161
Get out.

44:09.241 --> 44:11.401
- You'd better watch out.
- You're pathetic.

44:11.561 --> 44:12.601
Get out.

44:14.601 --> 44:16.281
- Let's get out of here.
- Where's Guillem?

44:16.401 --> 44:17.721
Where's Guillem?

44:17.961 --> 44:19.841
Do you want to find the flea?

44:29.601 --> 44:30.601
Take it easy, Lola.

44:30.721 --> 44:31.841
Where is he?

44:32.001 --> 44:33.001
He'll be fine.

44:33.201 --> 44:35.561
It's one of their tricks
to scare you,

44:35.721 --> 44:37.441
but I'm sure he's fine.

44:38.241 --> 44:40.161
Calm down.
I'll get you a herb tea.

44:40.321 --> 44:43.161
Sit down.
You're on in 10 minutes.

44:43.721 --> 44:45.201
But really,

44:45.361 --> 44:47.521
take it easy, I'm sure he's fine.

44:49.361 --> 44:52.401
We're down 150 pesetas from last month.

44:53.041 --> 44:55.321
And last month
we were down by almost 100.

44:55.481 --> 44:56.961
The sooner we get rid of the Baron,

44:57.161 --> 44:58.961
the sooner we stop losing money.

44:59.161 --> 45:01.841
That bastard has
the Military Governor behind him,

45:02.001 --> 45:03.361
and the Business Federation, too.

45:03.521 --> 45:05.041
We have to get rid of the bastard.

45:05.241 --> 45:07.641
No, we can't do anything.
We'll get into trouble.

45:08.721 --> 45:11.281
Unless we make it look like
an anarchist job.

45:15.441 --> 45:17.761
We'll take care of the Baron.

45:18.641 --> 45:21.281
Everyone's time comes,
sooner or later.

45:21.441 --> 45:24.081
Right now, we have to find out
who robbed the train.

45:26.561 --> 45:29.521
Hey, you're not skimming
off the top, are you?

45:30.681 --> 45:31.921
What are you laughing at?

45:33.801 --> 45:35.441
You're not skimming off the top?

45:35.801 --> 45:37.801
Writing down all the time...

45:39.161 --> 45:41.481
Is it "3 for me, nothing for you"?

45:44.841 --> 45:46.441
Are you skimming off the top?

45:47.601 --> 45:49.321
Are you skimming off the top?

45:50.681 --> 45:51.441
I'll kill you.

45:51.601 --> 45:53.561
Answer me, are you skimming...?

45:54.161 --> 45:55.721
Just kidding! Shit!

45:55.881 --> 45:57.041
Leave the kid alone.

45:57.241 --> 45:58.241
Look at him!

45:58.921 --> 46:00.161
It was a joke!

46:40.241 --> 46:42.161
I'm fine, I'm fine.

46:42.601 --> 46:44.761
Let me go, I'm fine.

46:49.441 --> 46:51.161
REVOLUTION OR DEATH

46:55.641 --> 46:57.521
They used Army issue weapons.

47:13.401 --> 47:15.401
You should be proud.

47:15.561 --> 47:18.521
The first girl to join an action squad.

47:28.361 --> 47:29.921
Get rid of the car.

47:41.601 --> 47:43.001
Where were you?

47:43.641 --> 47:45.281
I was worried.

47:45.441 --> 47:47.001
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.

47:47.201 --> 47:48.201
Sara!

47:51.361 --> 47:52.641
Keep well away from León.

47:54.321 --> 47:57.721
Anarchists don't accept orders
or authority, you taught me that.

47:57.881 --> 47:58.921
León is dangerous.

47:59.081 --> 48:02.001
León is willing to risk his life
to change things and so am I.

48:02.201 --> 48:03.201
Sara!

48:05.441 --> 48:08.241
Guns won't bring on revolution,
but chaos.

48:08.401 --> 48:09.681
So what do we do?

48:09.841 --> 48:11.481
Just stand idly by?

48:11.641 --> 48:14.601
Elisa was killed, it could've been me!
Don't you care?

48:14.761 --> 48:16.321
I am sorry about Elisa too!

48:19.321 --> 48:21.761
But killing other people
won't bring her back.

48:26.401 --> 48:30.161
Dad, strikes and speeches
aren't enough anymore.

49:00.961 --> 49:02.681
I want to talk to the Baron.

49:02.841 --> 49:04.561
The Baron is a very busy man.

49:04.721 --> 49:06.841
Tell him I'd like
to propose some business.

49:08.041 --> 49:09.041
Business?

49:10.441 --> 49:13.241
And why would I want
to get into business with you?

49:14.041 --> 49:15.241
I could be very useful.

49:15.401 --> 49:16.881
Oh, is that so?

49:17.041 --> 49:18.521
I can supply you with information.

49:19.161 --> 49:22.441
And tip you off if Rediú
was to make a move against you...

49:23.921 --> 49:25.041
Tempting.

49:25.801 --> 49:29.361
But I don't make a habit
of trusting people I don't know.

49:29.521 --> 49:30.961
You don't need to.

49:31.481 --> 49:34.281
You'll only pay for a job
or for some information.

49:35.561 --> 49:37.561
Boys, stop whispering!

49:38.201 --> 49:39.961
We're talking.

49:44.881 --> 49:46.001
Very well,

49:47.601 --> 49:51.881
the Majorcan will get in touch
when we require your services.

49:52.721 --> 49:54.161
What good are all the speeches?

49:54.401 --> 49:57.401
While they kill us,
you keep talking and talking.

49:57.561 --> 49:59.561
León, this situation will change soon.

49:59.721 --> 50:01.441
- It won't change.
- Trust me.

50:01.601 --> 50:03.361
I don't trust you, ask these people.

50:03.521 --> 50:06.561
These people are dying,
they're starving.

50:06.721 --> 50:08.561
We'll get nowhere with violence.

50:08.721 --> 50:09.561
No, ask them!

50:09.721 --> 50:11.281
- Violence...
- Ask them!

50:11.841 --> 50:14.641
Ask these people
if they want to keep on dying!

50:15.601 --> 50:17.321
This can't go on!

50:17.681 --> 50:19.841
Five more comrades gave up today!

50:20.241 --> 50:23.161
How long are we going to stand idly by?

50:23.561 --> 50:25.441
We're an example of resistance!

50:26.161 --> 50:28.881
There are more and more strikes
all over the country!

50:29.041 --> 50:31.961
More and more workers
are joining our cause!

50:32.161 --> 50:33.561
What good is that unless we act?

50:33.721 --> 50:35.361
The Boss...

50:38.681 --> 50:41.041
The Boss tried to bribe me.

50:42.161 --> 50:44.041
Do you know what that means?

50:44.241 --> 50:45.721
That he's scared!

50:45.881 --> 50:49.961
That he's desperate,
that the strike is ruining him.

50:50.841 --> 50:52.401
That this is the right road.

50:52.961 --> 50:55.481
The road where we get
trampled by his horses?

50:56.961 --> 50:58.801
Where he gradually starves us.

51:00.681 --> 51:02.801
If we resort to violence,

51:02.961 --> 51:05.961
they'll have the excuse
they need to destroy us.

51:07.481 --> 51:08.881
This is the road.

51:09.041 --> 51:10.561
This is the road!

51:10.721 --> 51:13.241
Resistance, this is the road!

51:13.441 --> 51:15.441
- Resistance!
- Salvador.

51:17.321 --> 51:19.161
I don't believe in your roads anymore,

51:19.801 --> 51:21.641
and there are lots more like me.

51:24.881 --> 51:27.601
The scabs! The scabs are coming!

51:48.961 --> 51:50.521
How's that healing up?

51:55.201 --> 51:57.201
How's it healing up?

51:57.361 --> 51:59.281
You don't give a shit.

51:59.441 --> 52:01.961
And I don't give a shit
about you either.

52:06.001 --> 52:08.001
Listen to me, hero.

52:08.321 --> 52:10.321
I know you're up to something...

52:11.561 --> 52:14.041
Sooner or later,
the chief will work it out too.

52:21.761 --> 52:23.361
Well, well, well.

52:23.521 --> 52:25.081
A welcoming committee!

52:25.881 --> 52:27.241
Any news, T.B.?

52:27.721 --> 52:29.761
The anarchist we killed last night

52:30.321 --> 52:32.281
worked in the MZA factory.

52:33.441 --> 52:35.521
Go with the kid
to the anarchist section,

52:35.681 --> 52:36.761
see what you can find out.

52:37.001 --> 52:39.041
I'll go with the Basque
to the factory.

53:01.281 --> 53:04.801
Don Emilio, you can't imagine
what this means to me.

53:05.281 --> 53:08.041
You know I'm a man
who keeps his promises.

53:08.601 --> 53:12.241
I want you to know
everything is settled

53:12.401 --> 53:15.801
and your problem will soon be over.

53:17.641 --> 53:18.801
Gentlemen.

53:19.521 --> 53:21.041
If I may, Governor.

53:21.241 --> 53:22.481
- I'd like to...
- Severiano,

53:22.641 --> 53:24.081
so nice to see you again.

53:25.041 --> 53:26.681
General Blanco.
Mr. de Fabra.

53:26.841 --> 53:27.841
Sir.

53:27.881 --> 53:29.641
And Commissioner Verdaguer.

53:33.241 --> 53:34.521
Commissioner.

53:34.681 --> 53:37.281
Gentlemen,
things cannot go on like this.

53:38.001 --> 53:39.561
Any day it could be one of us.

53:40.001 --> 53:41.761
Don Alfonso is right.

53:41.921 --> 53:44.841
We must take measures
before it's too late.

53:45.001 --> 53:47.081
All my officers are on the case.

53:47.281 --> 53:48.601
It's not enough.

53:48.761 --> 53:52.081
Gentlemen, my men are entirely
at your disposal.

53:52.281 --> 53:54.361
Give me names and we will act
in a forthright manner.

53:54.481 --> 53:55.841
Tit-for-tat reprisals

53:56.001 --> 53:58.721
are not only illegal,
they are also immoral.

53:58.881 --> 54:00.881
So, gentlemen,

54:01.041 --> 54:03.641
we'll have to put
troops on the street.

54:03.801 --> 54:05.041
With all due respect, Governor,

54:05.201 --> 54:08.761
the Army is for wars,
not patrolling the streets.

54:09.081 --> 54:10.201
Just three months ago,

54:10.361 --> 54:12.241
they assassinated
the President no less.

54:12.401 --> 54:14.201
This already is war, Commissioner.

54:14.441 --> 54:15.961
No, forgive me.

54:16.161 --> 54:17.681
This is a social problem.

54:17.841 --> 54:20.801
They stole a consignment
of automatic weapons

54:20.961 --> 54:22.721
and used them last night.

54:22.881 --> 54:24.881
This situation is untenable.

54:25.041 --> 54:26.041
Absolutely.

54:28.041 --> 54:31.281
Commissioner, our time is running out.

54:34.921 --> 54:37.161
<i>What a mess, Basque!</i>

54:37.321 --> 54:40.161
<i>There's no way we can get to
the anarchists...</i>

54:40.321 --> 54:41.681
<i>much less to his leader.</i>

54:42.721 --> 54:44.281
<i>Check that out.</i>

54:44.441 --> 54:46.561
<i>Those two thugs are Baron's men.</i>

54:46.721 --> 54:48.641
<i>I don't know
why the fuck they're here,</i>

54:48.801 --> 54:51.281
<i>but I don't like this at all.</i>

54:51.681 --> 54:53.441
<i>Who's the leader?</i>

54:55.201 --> 54:57.481
See that fat guy there
with the beard?

54:57.641 --> 55:00.521
Salvador, the leader of the anarchists.

55:01.641 --> 55:03.521
But he won't be for long.

55:05.361 --> 55:06.561
Basque, where are you going?

55:06.721 --> 55:07.801
Basque,

55:08.481 --> 55:10.401
Basque, what are you going to do?

55:10.561 --> 55:13.361
Basque, they'll kill you.
Basque! Basque!

57:29.921 --> 57:31.961
To victory!

57:33.081 --> 57:34.761
Victory!

57:39.881 --> 57:42.841
Commissioner. Commissioner.

57:45.201 --> 57:48.721
He confessed that the Baron
hired him to kill Salvador Ortiz.

57:51.201 --> 57:52.801
If they kill Ortiz,

57:53.881 --> 57:57.361
the violent anarchists
will take control of the situation.

57:59.721 --> 58:01.401
Take him to the cells.

58:01.561 --> 58:04.321
- Kid, watch him, alright?
- Yes, boss.

58:05.801 --> 58:07.761
Don't give him a kiss.

58:07.921 --> 58:08.961
He's not my type.

58:09.161 --> 58:09.881
Commissioner,

58:10.041 --> 58:12.241
Commissioner, this is our chance.

58:12.401 --> 58:14.721
We have a signed confession.
Let's arrest him.

58:14.881 --> 58:18.041
It's the word of a hired thug
against a "respectable businessman".

58:18.241 --> 58:21.601
We can't just let him get away
with it forever.

58:21.761 --> 58:24.601
I know, but we need concrete evidence.

58:24.761 --> 58:27.401
Only then will the bosses
and the Governor stop supporting him.

58:28.361 --> 58:30.841
Finding those weapons is still
our number one priority.

58:31.481 --> 58:33.721
We have 48 hours.

58:34.481 --> 58:37.561
Ortiz owes me one.
I think he might be able to help us.

58:40.881 --> 58:43.201
We need to come up
with something now,

58:43.361 --> 58:45.321
so if you have a plan,

58:46.201 --> 58:47.401
get on it.

58:48.441 --> 58:49.881
Commissioner,

58:50.041 --> 58:52.761
today we stopped
Salvador Ortiz from being killed.

58:52.921 --> 58:55.081
But unless we do something,

58:55.281 --> 58:58.681
the Baron will keep trying
and as you say, it'll be war.

59:02.241 --> 59:03.321
Alright.

59:03.961 --> 59:05.281
Alright.

59:05.721 --> 59:07.961
Search Eden for evidence.

59:08.161 --> 59:09.721
Bring in the Baron for questioning.

59:09.881 --> 59:11.921
Yes, Commissioner.

59:12.961 --> 59:14.081
Basque,

59:14.641 --> 59:16.161
you take care of Salvador.

59:17.081 --> 59:18.481
Miguel Ángel,

59:19.321 --> 59:22.161
you and I will visit
the Baron, alright?

59:22.321 --> 59:25.081
The jig is up for
that son of a bitch.

59:44.201 --> 59:46.361
Stop! Stop!

59:59.601 --> 01:00:01.241
What's the matter, Lola?

01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:04.041
- I can't do it.
- We already talked about it.

01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:06.561
The sooner you do it,
the sooner you'll get over it.

01:00:07.441 --> 01:00:10.561
And you, girls,
put a bit more pep into it!

01:00:11.201 --> 01:00:13.961
The public want asses.
But live ones,

01:00:14.161 --> 01:00:15.881
not dead ones!

01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:19.281
I'm looking at dead asses
and I want live ones!

01:00:19.481 --> 01:00:22.881
If I wanted dead asses, I'd look
for chorus girls in the morgue!

01:00:24.201 --> 01:00:26.081
Come on, from the top!

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:29.481
What's the matter?

01:00:29.681 --> 01:00:31.761
Things didn't go according to plan.

01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:36.041
Five-minute break.

01:00:36.881 --> 01:00:38.561
I'll take care of it personally.

01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:40.401
I promise, no more errors.

01:00:40.561 --> 01:00:42.321
I'll take care of it.

01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:44.441
- Baron?
- What do you want?

01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:46.081
You have a call...

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:55.401
Hello?

01:00:55.561 --> 01:00:57.201
<i>It's Aníbal Uriarte.</i>

01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:44.001
One more step and you're dead.

01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:57.681
Who was that thug working for?

01:02:00.401 --> 01:02:02.041
García Serrano ordered it, right?

01:02:03.841 --> 01:02:05.241
They're going to try again.

01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:10.161
I could help your father.

01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:13.721
Why would a policeman
help an anarchist?

01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:16.201
Because he could help me.

01:02:18.521 --> 01:02:19.801
My dad is no snitch.

01:02:19.961 --> 01:02:21.161
I know.

01:02:22.841 --> 01:02:24.401
He's a man of ideals.

01:02:26.361 --> 01:02:27.441
Are you?

01:02:33.561 --> 01:02:35.561
I had them once,
but they weren't much good to me.

01:02:36.161 --> 01:02:37.961
I don't trust men with no ideals.

01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.481
Don't trust men with them either.

01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:47.081
Can I have one?

01:03:13.321 --> 01:03:14.641
Where's your boss?

01:03:18.201 --> 01:03:19.681
Are you stupid?

01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:21.441
Where's your boss?

01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:22.441
Hold on.

01:03:22.601 --> 01:03:24.161
Looking for me, gentlemen?

01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:25.321
Baron,

01:03:28.641 --> 01:03:31.561
you're under arrest for ordering
the death of Salvador Ortiz.

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:36.481
I suppose you have some proof
to accuse me of such an outrage.

01:03:36.641 --> 01:03:38.321
The thug you sent

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.921
is willing to testify against you.

01:03:41.081 --> 01:03:43.361
I think that call is for you.

01:03:49.401 --> 01:03:50.601
Yes?

01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:57.721
Alright.

01:04:00.681 --> 01:04:02.041
Let him go.

01:04:04.281 --> 01:04:06.961
You won't be offended
if I don't see you out, will you?

01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:09.961
Let's go.

01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:16.081
What happened?

01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:19.201
The thug has been murdered.
In the police station.

01:04:23.481 --> 01:04:25.961
It had to be one of ours.

01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:28.561
I know.

01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.481
He's with me.

01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:42.281
The gun.

01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:45.201
You have to leave it here.

01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:12.961
He wants to talk to you.

01:05:14.841 --> 01:05:16.161
What does he want?

01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:19.681
Leave us alone.

01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:35.241
How could you bring a cop here?

01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:38.761
Is tomorrow still on?

01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:42.721
Of course it's still on.

01:05:42.961 --> 01:05:45.721
I suppose you want something
in return for what you did.

01:05:47.161 --> 01:05:49.721
If it's money you're after,
you came to the wrong place.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.721
I want information.

01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:55.961
What kind of information?

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.841
Who did the MZA train job?

01:06:00.681 --> 01:06:01.841
Where are those guns?

01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:05.241
Even if I knew, I'd never give
that information to a cop.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.041
We're on different sides of the fence,

01:06:10.881 --> 01:06:13.361
but neither of us wants this
to end in a war.

01:06:16.841 --> 01:06:18.241
I don't know who did it,

01:06:19.641 --> 01:06:21.801
but I'm sure they weren't anarchists.

01:06:24.601 --> 01:06:27.641
Last night some anarchists
fired on us with Army-issue guns.

01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:30.561
Having those guns

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:33.161
doesn't mean they stole them.

01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:40.521
One more thing.

01:06:43.441 --> 01:06:44.481
Thank you.

01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:04.561
Be my guest.

01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:18.321
The Baron wants to see you.

01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:21.521
You're a real artist.

01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:25.801
Like it?

01:07:31.161 --> 01:07:32.561
Come with me.

01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:48.361
What did I tell you?

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:04.801
Wait here.

01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.561
Baron.

01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:21.481
Here you go.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.041
The job was good,
and so's the payment.

01:08:24.881 --> 01:08:28.560
Keep giving me information
and I'll keep giving you...

01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:29.841
envelopes.

01:09:04.921 --> 01:09:07.321
Everybody hold it! Hold it!

01:09:08.441 --> 01:09:10.281
On the floor, now! On the floor!

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.761
On the floor!

01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:16.241
- Everybody hold it!
- Hold it! In the center!

01:09:16.481 --> 01:09:17.281
Move!

01:09:17.441 --> 01:09:18.761
This is a robbery.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.281
Anyone tries anything, I'll kill him!

01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:23.201
Cooperate and nothing will happen!

01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:26.161
You!
The money in a bag, quick!

01:09:26.321 --> 01:09:27.161
Quick!

01:09:27.321 --> 01:09:29.001
You! Don't move!

01:09:29.201 --> 01:09:30.201
Don't move!

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.161
Walk.

01:10:01.601 --> 01:10:05.161
So you have dealings with the Baron.

01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:07.961
Yes.

01:10:09.401 --> 01:10:11.881
The Majorcan killed the accountant,
on the Baron's orders.

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:13.441
They stole the guns,

01:10:13.481 --> 01:10:15.241
and they're selling them
to the anarchists.

01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:18.921
- Where are the guns, then?
- I don't know yet.

01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:21.921
You're not playing with us, Basque?

01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:26.641
The Commissioner wanted the weapons
to be found, and that's what I'm doing.

01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:29.761
Sir, sir...

01:10:30.361 --> 01:10:31.921
The Bank of Barcelona's being robbed.

01:10:32.081 --> 01:10:33.401
Not now, kid, not now.

01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:35.561
One of the robbers
asked for Aníbal Uriarte.

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:47.961
Sir, we shot down
one of the anarchists.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.281
Another fled with the money.

01:10:49.401 --> 01:10:51.961
And we have another trapped.
A woman.

01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:54.201
She wants to speak with Aníbal Uriarte.

01:11:06.961 --> 01:11:09.001
This is Aníbal Uriarte.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:14.881
Come over slowly.

01:11:20.441 --> 01:11:21.721
Sara.

01:11:22.721 --> 01:11:24.161
Is that you?

01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:31.001
Sara, don't make things worse.
Let these people go.

01:11:35.921 --> 01:11:36.921
Get out.

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:39.561
Out, out!

01:11:53.521 --> 01:11:55.041
Sara, it's okay.

01:11:56.601 --> 01:11:57.641
It's okay.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:11:59.961
Just give me the gun.

01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:05.081
Trust me, it'll be alright.
Give me the gun.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.241
It's over.

01:12:15.561 --> 01:12:17.361
Trust me, give me the gun.

01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:40.161
She's the daughter of Salvador Ortiz.

01:12:42.601 --> 01:12:44.601
Yes, I remember this hothead.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.481
Take off her coat.

01:12:52.761 --> 01:12:54.321
Give her to me.

01:12:55.801 --> 01:12:58.561
- No!
- Easy, easy.

01:13:00.801 --> 01:13:02.081
Miss Ortiz.

01:13:03.441 --> 01:13:05.761
We can do this the easy way...

01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:09.001
or the hard way.

01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:13.641
Where's your accomplice?

01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:16.921
Where did you get the guns?

01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:19.321
I don't know anything.

01:13:19.881 --> 01:13:21.481
"I don't know anything"?

01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:24.401
"I don't know anything"?

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.721
That's enough!

01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:27.201
That's enough!

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:29.201
You don't give orders to me.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:30.361
T.B.!

01:13:46.401 --> 01:13:48.281
You can help us
and we can help you.

01:13:56.841 --> 01:13:59.561
Governor, the rumor is that the attack
on our positions in Annual

01:13:59.721 --> 01:14:01.337
is much more serious
than the government admits.

01:14:01.361 --> 01:14:03.041
There's talk of over a thousand dead.

01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:06.561
You press boys are always making
mountains out of molehills.

01:14:07.161 --> 01:14:08.561
The rebel incursion was serious,

01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:10.961
but our soldiers will fight back,

01:14:11.161 --> 01:14:13.561
and get these savages
off Spanish territory.

01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:15.617
The Bank of Barcelona
was robbed by the anarchists.

01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:17.561
There are several dead
and others wounded.

01:14:19.201 --> 01:14:21.241
That's the real problem
with this country.

01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:24.521
We'll put an end to this scum.

01:14:25.521 --> 01:14:27.761
Governor, Governor, please!

01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:33.401
What did you find out?

01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:36.841
She was taken away
by the Information Brigade.

01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:42.201
Find León.

01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:44.361
Tell him I want to see him.

01:15:16.961 --> 01:15:18.761
Where are the guns?

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.761
They were here.

01:15:23.361 --> 01:15:24.801
Here? Where?

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:28.761
Are you jerking us around?

01:15:28.921 --> 01:15:30.521
They were here, I swear.

01:15:46.921 --> 01:15:49.401
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:15:49.561 --> 01:15:51.041
You're so pretty.

01:15:51.241 --> 01:15:53.001
You're so pretty.

01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:54.961
You're so pretty.

01:15:56.321 --> 01:15:58.881
You're stalling us
so your friend can get away.

01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:00.041
That's it, isn't it?

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.401
You're so hot.

01:16:08.281 --> 01:16:09.921
No!

01:16:10.081 --> 01:16:13.361
Where are your accomplices?
Where are your accomplices?

01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:16.041
Where are they?

01:16:16.241 --> 01:16:17.641
I'm no snitch.

01:16:27.801 --> 01:16:31.161
Relax, I'm gonna treat you good.

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:34.241
Listen to me, are you going to
tell me where they are?

01:16:35.361 --> 01:16:37.721
You smell like strawberry tart.

01:16:37.881 --> 01:16:39.721
You taste like strawberry tart.

01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:45.721
Relax, damn it!

01:16:49.521 --> 01:16:50.841
You're going to like it.

01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:53.241
- No!
- You're going to like it.

01:16:57.721 --> 01:16:59.241
You're going to like it.

01:17:07.241 --> 01:17:08.241
Drop the gun.

01:17:09.721 --> 01:17:11.081
The gun.

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:22.241
You're making a mistake, Basque.

01:17:25.881 --> 01:17:27.401
Let's go.

01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.241
Get in the car.

01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:39.041
Don't move! Don't move!

01:17:39.481 --> 01:17:40.921
Give me the gun.

01:17:43.361 --> 01:17:44.961
Give me the gun.

01:17:45.841 --> 01:17:47.561
Where's the notebook?

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:54.641
It's not worth dying
for those motherfuckers.

01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:56.161
Give me the notebook.

01:17:57.001 --> 01:17:58.241
Give me the notebook.

01:18:02.441 --> 01:18:03.561
Get out of here!

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:05.041
Get out of here!

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.601
I told you to stay away
from my daughter!

01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:35.601
It's okay!

01:18:35.761 --> 01:18:36.961
Salvador!

01:18:39.001 --> 01:18:41.881
Talking we can understand
each other, right?

01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:45.161
Your daughter wanted to join the group.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.201
It was her decision.

01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:49.561
I want you to stop what you're doing.

01:18:51.361 --> 01:18:53.081
We're trade unionists, not killers!

01:18:53.281 --> 01:18:54.961
The goal is the Revolution.

01:18:55.761 --> 01:18:58.001
For that,
we need to take up arms and fight.

01:18:58.201 --> 01:18:59.561
Don't you understand?

01:19:00.521 --> 01:19:04.241
In 10 years we've gone
from 100,000 members to a million.

01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:11.561
Soon we'll double that.

01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:15.761
León.

01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:20.881
You're either with us or against us.

01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:24.081
Same here.

01:19:24.281 --> 01:19:26.321
Salvador, let's go.

01:19:26.481 --> 01:19:28.361
Salvador, please, let's go!

01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:17.601
Faster!

01:20:45.761 --> 01:20:46.921
T.B.!

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.201
That way!

01:22:10.841 --> 01:22:12.841
Are you alright?

01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:45.561
In Madrid, they have no record
of any Aníbal Uriarte,

01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:48.321
or Officer Uriarte,
or anyone by that name.

01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:50.001
So who the hell is he then?!

01:22:50.201 --> 01:22:51.921
I don't know...

01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:54.321
All the paperwork we received is fake.

01:22:54.481 --> 01:22:55.881
Attention!

01:22:57.161 --> 01:23:00.241
This man calls himself Aníbal Uriarte.

01:23:00.401 --> 01:23:02.161
He's been passing himself off
as a policeman.

01:23:02.721 --> 01:23:04.601
He murdered Officer Miguel Ángel Barral

01:23:04.761 --> 01:23:07.761
and ran off with the anarchist girl
we arrested in the Bank of Barcelona.

01:23:07.921 --> 01:23:08.961
I want him alive.

01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:10.561
Alive.

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:12.561
I want to know who he is

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.961
and what the hell
he's doing in this city.

01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:30.921
Aníbal knows everything about us.

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:35.761
If he turns up,
he'd better be dead, right?

01:24:06.961 --> 01:24:07.961
Are you hurt?

01:24:09.241 --> 01:24:10.801
Just a fragment, nothing serious.

01:24:18.681 --> 01:24:20.441
My parents used to bring me
to this beach.

01:24:21.441 --> 01:24:23.081
I haven't been here since my mom died.

01:24:25.681 --> 01:24:26.801
What happened?

01:24:28.041 --> 01:24:29.961
It was during the "Tragic Week".

01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:32.961
They were at a meeting,
there was an explosion and...

01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:41.881
Sometimes I dream of
the three of us here, swimming...

01:24:43.281 --> 01:24:45.561
But suddenly
I turn around and they're gone...

01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:48.961
and I'm all alone
in the middle of the sea.

01:24:55.081 --> 01:24:56.561
Why are you helping me?

01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:07.721
I like people with ideals.

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:16.961
We have to go.

01:25:30.521 --> 01:25:32.721
Lola, you're here at last.

01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:35.881
Girl, the joint's full.

01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:38.801
I don't feel well.

01:25:38.961 --> 01:25:40.681
I'd like to rest.

01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:43.081
If I told you what I'd like...

01:25:43.761 --> 01:25:46.361
Come on, go get 'em.

01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:49.001
The doctor said
I should rest for a few days.

01:25:50.641 --> 01:25:53.761
So, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go.

01:25:53.921 --> 01:25:57.201
But the other time
you didn't rest and you were fine.

01:26:04.321 --> 01:26:05.841
They murdered him.

01:26:11.161 --> 01:26:13.081
He was a good man.

01:26:14.521 --> 01:26:16.041
Why?

01:26:17.401 --> 01:26:20.481
Girl, life is anything but fair.

01:26:21.961 --> 01:26:24.001
Go on, rest up.

01:26:25.521 --> 01:26:28.481
I'll find a stand-in. Go.

01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:45.761
What are you doing here?

01:26:53.281 --> 01:26:54.881
Give me the Basque.

01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:57.961
He's passing himself off as a cop,
but he is not.

01:26:58.161 --> 01:27:00.001
Hand him over and I'll leave you be.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.081
And what if I don't?

01:27:09.921 --> 01:27:10.921
Baron, if I'm going down,

01:27:12.161 --> 01:27:13.601
you're coming with me.

01:27:16.601 --> 01:27:17.601
Look, Rediú,

01:27:17.641 --> 01:27:22.921
coming through here are politicians,
the military, journalists, criminals,

01:27:23.081 --> 01:27:24.561
policemen...

01:27:24.721 --> 01:27:26.921
I know everything about everyone.

01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:29.561
Don't be naïve.

01:28:27.401 --> 01:28:29.241
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:32.001
I thought I'd lost you.

01:28:32.201 --> 01:28:34.241
No, I'm fine.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.961
We have to go.

01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:05.401
It's only half finished,
but nobody will bother you here.

01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:08.721
I wanted to paint the place, but...

01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:10.681
I can help you with that.

01:29:10.841 --> 01:29:11.841
Thank you.

01:29:11.921 --> 01:29:13.561
No, thank you, comrade.

01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:19.201
Good luck.

01:29:21.921 --> 01:29:23.081
Why don't you stay?

01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:25.161
They're looking for you too.

01:29:27.401 --> 01:29:29.321
I've got some unfinished business.

01:29:30.401 --> 01:29:32.361
You can't go with your wound like that.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.201
I'm sure there's something here
to clean it up.

01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:51.321
How is it?

01:29:52.641 --> 01:29:54.521
It's just a scratch.

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.561
You're bleeding a lot
for just a scratch.

01:29:57.721 --> 01:29:59.041
Let me.

01:30:13.961 --> 01:30:15.521
What happened to you?

01:30:22.881 --> 01:30:24.801
That was in Morocco.

01:30:25.241 --> 01:30:26.561
At the beginning of the war.

01:30:29.681 --> 01:30:33.161
The cabilas attacked our garrison
and the barracks were set on fire.

01:30:37.801 --> 01:30:40.321
After that it was all blood.

01:30:45.241 --> 01:30:47.321
And the smell of burning flesh.

01:30:55.161 --> 01:30:56.761
What are you going to do now?

01:30:57.961 --> 01:30:59.881
Do you have family or someone?

01:31:02.521 --> 01:31:03.721
I don't have anyone.

01:31:06.641 --> 01:31:08.201
You should join us.

01:31:09.401 --> 01:31:11.841
We could form our own action group.

01:31:16.481 --> 01:31:19.321
A cop in an anarchist action group?

01:31:19.921 --> 01:31:21.961
The police are workers too,
aren't they?

01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:33.561
I have to go.

01:31:38.361 --> 01:31:39.961
Thank you.

01:31:40.841 --> 01:31:42.281
Take care.

01:31:45.001 --> 01:31:46.481
Stay out of trouble.

01:31:47.681 --> 01:31:48.721
You too.

01:34:39.481 --> 01:34:43.721
I know you killed the accountant
so he couldn't talk.

01:34:47.401 --> 01:34:48.961
I killed the accountant...

01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:52.321
so Lola wouldn't leave Eden.

01:34:55.561 --> 01:34:57.761
Who stole those guns, then?

01:35:03.361 --> 01:35:05.521
Excuse me, excuse me!

01:35:08.881 --> 01:35:09.961
I have to talk to you.

01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:11.161
I'm sorry, sir.

01:35:14.721 --> 01:35:16.361
You can leave now.

01:35:17.801 --> 01:35:18.801
Leave us alone.

01:35:25.561 --> 01:35:27.481
Officer Barral tried to kill me.

01:35:27.641 --> 01:35:28.881
I had to defend myself.

01:35:29.481 --> 01:35:31.041
He, Rediú and Officer Beltrán

01:35:31.241 --> 01:35:34.361
extort businessmen
and murder anarchists, it's all here.

01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:49.001
Who the hell are you?

01:35:49.201 --> 01:35:51.281
That's the least of your worries, sir.

01:35:52.681 --> 01:35:55.881
I'm about to find out
where those guns are, but I need time.

01:36:02.321 --> 01:36:04.721
Commissioner, you know
how corrupt they are.

01:36:05.961 --> 01:36:07.561
Only I can help you.

01:36:09.041 --> 01:36:10.841
I need more time.

01:36:30.921 --> 01:36:33.321
Where the hell is the Majorcan?

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:35.641
Gastón, have you seen the Majorcan?

01:36:35.801 --> 01:36:38.041
No, not since he went out.

01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:43.561
What are you doing here?

01:36:44.961 --> 01:36:47.561
Rediú told me you're not even a cop.

01:36:47.721 --> 01:36:49.041
And you trust him?

01:36:50.321 --> 01:36:52.481
Rediú doesn't like me
doing business with you.

01:36:55.801 --> 01:36:58.161
Now more than ever
you'll need my help.

01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:00.841
And why is that?

01:37:02.241 --> 01:37:03.721
The Majorcan is dead.

01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:07.241
He tried to kill Salvador Ortiz,

01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:09.241
but it seems his bodyguard
is a better shot.

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:15.361
I can still help you.

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:21.601
Wait here.

01:37:22.681 --> 01:37:23.721
What's going on?

01:37:23.881 --> 01:37:26.321
It's all ready for tomorrow.
We've got the car...

01:37:27.001 --> 01:37:28.601
Miss Montaner.

01:37:32.601 --> 01:37:34.801
The Baron had Guillem killed.

01:37:34.961 --> 01:37:35.961
What?

01:37:36.081 --> 01:37:37.161
Basque!

01:37:38.041 --> 01:37:39.721
Come with us.

01:38:00.721 --> 01:38:03.201
Stop, stop right there!

01:38:04.841 --> 01:38:06.961
That boxes, quick!

01:38:07.761 --> 01:38:09.601
So you're from Orio.

01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:14.321
I lived for a few months
in Fuenterrabía.

01:38:14.481 --> 01:38:17.921
I was the manager
of "Le Casino de Fontarabie",

01:38:18.081 --> 01:38:19.321
next to the French border.

01:38:20.881 --> 01:38:23.801
There's nothing like a border
to make money, right?

01:38:23.961 --> 01:38:25.481
Sorry, that's a lie.

01:38:25.641 --> 01:38:27.401
War is. Silly me.

01:38:32.601 --> 01:38:34.361
Here he comes.

01:38:35.281 --> 01:38:37.601
Aníbal, tomorrow's going
to be a big day.

01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:42.001
If you want to prosper,
stick with me.

01:38:43.681 --> 01:38:45.361
As close as possible.

01:38:51.881 --> 01:38:54.641
Separate the blue boxes from the other.

01:38:54.801 --> 01:38:58.041
The blue ones on the right.
Come on.

01:39:02.961 --> 01:39:04.361
Captain.

01:39:04.521 --> 01:39:06.841
All in order, I assume.

01:39:07.001 --> 01:39:08.241
All as we agreed.

01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:11.161
Alright. Done deal.

01:39:26.201 --> 01:39:28.321
I don't think he's coming back.

01:39:30.601 --> 01:39:34.721
Whoever he is,
he has plans of his own.

01:39:34.881 --> 01:39:36.321
I'm going back to the city.

01:39:37.921 --> 01:39:39.201
Sara...

01:39:40.001 --> 01:39:42.881
- The police are looking for you.
- We can't stay here,

01:39:43.041 --> 01:39:44.761
we have to keep fighting.

01:39:48.521 --> 01:39:50.161
You're just like your mother.

01:39:50.321 --> 01:39:52.561
Just as brave and just as stubborn.

01:39:53.441 --> 01:39:55.401
Of course we'll go back to Barcelona,

01:39:55.881 --> 01:39:58.161
but when things calm down.

01:40:12.801 --> 01:40:17.201
General Silvestre has committed suicide
and General Navarro has been captured.

01:40:17.601 --> 01:40:21.321
More than 5000 soldiers are dead
and another 1000 taken prisoner.

01:40:23.001 --> 01:40:24.761
An utter disaster.

01:40:26.801 --> 01:40:28.041
What have you found out?

01:40:30.481 --> 01:40:34.321
Governor Martinez Anido is responsible
for the MZA train robbery.

01:40:37.961 --> 01:40:39.481
His men stole the arms cache

01:40:39.641 --> 01:40:42.041
disguised as anarchists
so that they'd get the blame.

01:40:43.881 --> 01:40:46.001
Now they're selling the guns
through a local mobster

01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:47.881
to crank up the violence and...

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.561
justify military intervention.

01:40:55.161 --> 01:40:58.561
If we act swiftly, we could still get
the situation under control.

01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:03.681
What happened in Annual
could be lethal for the Government.

01:41:03.841 --> 01:41:07.481
We need to distract public opinion.

01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:12.641
Minister,

01:41:13.641 --> 01:41:17.681
if the army and anarchists clash,
it could end in a civil war.

01:41:18.201 --> 01:41:19.761
We'll be ready...

01:41:20.361 --> 01:41:21.801
When the situation
becomes untenable,

01:41:21.921 --> 01:41:25.161
we'll launch a coup
to re-establish law and order.

01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:30.921
Lots of innocent people will die.

01:41:32.961 --> 01:41:34.841
It's a matter of national security.

01:41:38.481 --> 01:41:40.881
That's exactly what I was told
a few years ago.

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:43.721
There was you,
Berenguer and Navarro. Remember?

01:41:46.161 --> 01:41:48.241
I warned you about that attack,

01:41:48.801 --> 01:41:51.161
but you preferred to do nothing.

01:41:51.441 --> 01:41:54.481
You needed a massacre so public opinion

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:57.641
saw the Moroccans as savages
and that more troops were required.

01:41:57.801 --> 01:41:59.601
That was a matter
of national security too.

01:41:59.761 --> 01:42:01.841
We did what we thought
best for the country.

01:42:02.001 --> 01:42:03.481
For the country or for yourselves?!

01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:05.961
Watch your tone, Captain.

01:42:11.561 --> 01:42:13.081
Your mission is over.

01:42:13.281 --> 01:42:15.801
Pack your things
and go back to Madrid.

01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:09.801
Disaster in Annual!

01:43:09.961 --> 01:43:13.561
Thousands of soldiers slaughtered
because of an inept Government!

01:43:13.721 --> 01:43:15.601
Read all about it
in <i>Solidaridad Obrera!</i>

01:43:22.881 --> 01:43:24.521
It's open!

01:46:09.641 --> 01:46:11.561
- Have you heard?
- What?

01:46:11.721 --> 01:46:12.961
Ortiz has been murdered.

01:46:13.161 --> 01:46:14.937
- Salvador Ortiz?
- You could see that coming.

01:46:14.961 --> 01:46:16.281
He was shot dead.

01:46:16.921 --> 01:46:18.841
This is going to get ugly.

01:46:19.001 --> 01:46:21.041
Bad times are coming.

01:47:03.361 --> 01:47:04.721
Sara,

01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:07.401
he'd like it.

01:47:10.881 --> 01:47:12.521
Come on.

01:47:18.441 --> 01:47:20.241
Listen a moment!

01:47:21.081 --> 01:47:23.881
Salvador's daughter wants
to say a few words.

01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:38.641
My father was convinced

01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:42.481
that dialogue was the road.

01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:48.881
He believed...

01:47:50.481 --> 01:47:52.321
that peacefully...

01:47:53.761 --> 01:47:55.761
we'd win the battle.

01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:03.961
But he was wrong.

01:48:09.721 --> 01:48:11.961
And he died trying.

01:48:19.761 --> 01:48:22.721
The peace he wanted

01:48:23.241 --> 01:48:24.561
is no longer possible.

01:48:24.721 --> 01:48:26.921
Salvador's death must not
go unpunished!

01:48:27.081 --> 01:48:28.241
No!

01:48:28.841 --> 01:48:32.081
The time has come
to take up arms and fight!!

01:48:32.281 --> 01:48:35.081
The time has come for Revolution!!

01:48:35.281 --> 01:48:38.161
Revolution!!
For Salvador!

01:48:38.761 --> 01:48:42.481
- Comrades, let's fight!
- Revolution!!

01:48:45.721 --> 01:48:47.841
Revolution!!

01:48:49.401 --> 01:48:50.561
For Salvador!

01:48:50.921 --> 01:48:52.321
For Salvador!

01:49:18.561 --> 01:49:20.361
Sara!

01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:23.801
Sara!

01:49:25.721 --> 01:49:27.441
Sara!

01:49:34.001 --> 01:49:35.441
Sara!

01:49:39.241 --> 01:49:40.881
I'm sorry.

01:49:41.561 --> 01:49:42.961
I'm so sorry.

01:49:44.881 --> 01:49:47.561
If you take up arms,
the Army will hit the streets.

01:49:48.561 --> 01:49:49.641
They'll kill all of you.

01:49:52.081 --> 01:49:54.561
It's too late for words.

01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:59.081
That's what the men
who killed him want, they want war!

01:49:59.481 --> 01:50:00.761
Sara!

01:50:27.801 --> 01:50:29.881
He chose to take himself
out of the picture.

01:50:32.561 --> 01:50:34.841
We have to arrest
García Serrano and the Baron

01:50:35.001 --> 01:50:36.041
for the murder of Ortiz.

01:50:36.721 --> 01:50:38.361
It's the only way to calm things down.

01:50:38.521 --> 01:50:39.641
It wasn't them.

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:42.201
Romero.

01:50:46.961 --> 01:50:49.921
It's the same kind used by
the anarchists who attacked the bar.

01:50:52.641 --> 01:50:54.161
The arms are in Eden.

01:50:56.241 --> 01:50:58.161
The sale goes down tonight.
We have to act now.

01:51:48.521 --> 01:51:50.361
Happy with the merchandise?

01:51:51.321 --> 01:51:53.161
Of course.

01:51:56.201 --> 01:51:57.841
It was you, wasn't it?

01:51:59.241 --> 01:52:02.681
You killed Ortiz to get
control of the Union.

01:52:03.481 --> 01:52:05.001
Naughty.

01:52:17.801 --> 01:52:22.441
I hope when this is all over,
you'll tell me who you are.

01:52:34.601 --> 01:52:36.681
Quick, quick! Come on!

01:52:44.441 --> 01:52:45.961
Aren't you going to count it?

01:52:46.161 --> 01:52:48.241
I doubt you'd be
crazy enough to cheat me.

01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:50.201
True.

01:52:55.001 --> 01:53:00.041
But a businessman shouldn't trust
even his own father.

01:53:01.601 --> 01:53:03.001
<i>Scheiße!</i>

01:53:14.561 --> 01:53:15.561
Police!

01:54:09.921 --> 01:54:11.761
Baron, stop!

01:54:11.921 --> 01:54:12.921
You're under arrest!

01:54:38.761 --> 01:54:40.401
It was you...

01:54:47.561 --> 01:54:48.561
Sara!

01:54:58.041 --> 01:54:59.361
Come on.

01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:03.041
Darling,

01:56:03.441 --> 01:56:04.441
I did it all for you.

01:59:16.561 --> 01:59:19.641
<i>On September 13, 1923,
General Miguel Primo de Rivera</i>

01:59:19.801 --> 01:59:23.041
<i>led a military coup with the backing
of most military units,</i>

01:59:23.241 --> 01:59:25.921
<i>the Catalan bourgeoisie
and Andalusian landowners.</i>

01:59:26.081 --> 01:59:29.401
<i>General Martinez Anido was named
