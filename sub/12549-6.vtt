00:07.208 --> 00:08.239
Narrator:
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.239 --> 00:09.410
KAREN, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT VIK.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.512
VIK'S DEATH HAS BEEN
ESPECIALLY HARD ON DANNY.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.744
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE PERSON
WHO GAVE REGINA THE NECKLACE

00:13.744 --> 00:16.547
- MIGHT BE CONNECTED--
- JUST STOP IT, JO.

00:16.547 --> 00:18.119
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.092
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE LINK
BETWEEN REGINA AND TARA.

00:21.092 --> 00:24.395
THAT NECKLACE IS STILL
THE BEST LEAD WE HAVE.

00:24.395 --> 00:27.158
Rico:
WHY DO YOU TRUST HIM?
HE LIED TO US, LIKE, A LOT.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.230
Danny:
THIS WAS SENT TO REGINA?
WHEN?

00:29.230 --> 00:32.032
Lacey:
IT WAS POSTMARKED
TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.705
- WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS
TO THE POLICE.
- NO, I CAN'T.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.807
LACEY, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

00:36.807 --> 00:39.670
I KNOW YOU BLAME DANNY
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:39.670 --> 00:42.313
BUT HIM COMING BACK HERE,
IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR HER.

00:42.313 --> 00:45.376
MY GOD, TESS,
YOU'RE BEING CHARMED
BY A FREAKIN' PSYCHOPATH.

00:45.376 --> 00:46.817
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:46.817 --> 00:48.319
LACEY FOUND SOMETHING.

00:57.628 --> 01:00.791
( chattering )

01:11.142 --> 01:12.803
Danny:
YOU STILL CAN'T THINK
OF ANYONE?

01:12.803 --> 01:15.146
NO, REGINA NEVER TALKED
ABOUT ANYONE

01:15.146 --> 01:16.777
WHO WOULD
SEND SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:16.777 --> 01:20.080
CERTAINLY NO ONE
FROM A RANDOM APARTMENT
BUILDING IN CONNECTICUT.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.254
I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE DATED
A GUY IN CONNECTICUT LAST YEAR.

01:23.254 --> 01:24.815
I KNOW, I WENT THROUGH
ALL MY OLD TEXTS WITH HER,

01:24.815 --> 01:27.158
AND SHE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT HIM.

01:27.158 --> 01:29.420
HE WAS JUST
HER CONNECTICUT BOY TOY.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.122
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR OTHER FRIENDS?

01:31.122 --> 01:33.093
WOULD THEY KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BOY TOY?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.296
TRUST ME,
IF REGINA DIDN'T TELL ME,
SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.129
BESIDES, I CAN'T TALK
TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.871
- RIGHT, JUST US.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

01:40.871 --> 01:44.104
WELL, SILVER LINING--
WE NOW HAVE TWO GRAND
IN HUNDREDS.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.106
( phone beeping )

01:46.106 --> 01:48.108
I'M SORRY, LACEY,
ARE WE BORING YOU?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.741
I'M TEXTING
MY BOYFRIEND BACK, JO.
IS THAT OKAY?

01:50.741 --> 01:52.813
'KAY, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO INSISTED ON MEETING HERE.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.715
AND YOU BROUGHT
ALL OF THIS TO US.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.218
- I BROUGHT IT TO DANNY.
- OKAY, DON'T TURN
ON EACH OTHER.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.390
THEN THE CONFUSING
BLACKMAIL NOTE WINS.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.792
I STILL THINK WE SHOULD
JUST TELL MY DAD ABOUT IT.

02:01.792 --> 02:04.555
WHAT IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT?
HER FRIENDS, HER MOM.

02:04.555 --> 02:08.199
HOW WOULD THEY FEEL
IF THEY KNEW REGINA
WAS INVOLVED IN...

02:08.199 --> 02:11.732
I DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYONE
UNTIL WE KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.134
DANNY'S LIFE
IS AT STAKE HERE.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.338
I'M SORRY.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.810
LET ME JUST THINK
MORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS

02:19.810 --> 02:22.173
AND THEN WE'LL REGROUP.

02:22.173 --> 02:25.246
I HAVE TO GO MEET
WITH PHOEBE AND SARITA.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.448
TELL 'EM I SAY HI.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.827
CAN YOU GIVE HER A CHANCE?

02:36.827 --> 02:39.159
SHE'S MORE ONBOARD
THAN SHE WAS BEFORE.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.331
IT'S PROGRESS, RIGHT?

02:40.331 --> 02:43.464
SHE'LL NEVER BE
TOTALLY ONBOARD.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.881
( door opens )

03:00.881 --> 03:04.555
Karen:
DANNY, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THE GROCERIES, PLEASE?

03:04.555 --> 03:06.617
( door closes )

03:10.321 --> 03:12.523
MOTHER?

03:15.466 --> 03:17.368
WHERE IS IT?

03:17.368 --> 03:19.300
IT'S GONE.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.772
I GOT RID OF IT.

03:21.772 --> 03:23.874
I NEEDED THAT NECKLACE.

03:23.874 --> 03:27.408
WHY? HUH?

03:27.408 --> 03:30.881
WHY DID YOU HAVE IT?

03:30.881 --> 03:33.213
AND WHY DID YOU
LIE TO ME ABOUT IT?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.416
IT WAS IN MY LOCKER, OKAY?

03:35.416 --> 03:38.349
THE DAY AFTER REGINA DIED,
SOMEONE JUST LEFT IT THERE
FOR ME.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.723
WHOEVER KILLED HER
MUST HAVE KNOWN

03:42.723 --> 03:45.926
THAT THAT NECKLACE
BELONGED TO AUNT TARA.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.899
THEY KNEW THAT IT
WOULD MAKE ME LOOK GUILTY.

03:48.899 --> 03:50.501
YEAH, WELL,
THEY WERE RIGHT.

03:50.501 --> 03:53.664
YOU THINK THIS MEANS
THAT I KILLED REGINA,
DON'T YOU?

03:53.664 --> 03:55.866
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULDN'T GET RID OF IT.

03:55.866 --> 03:58.909
I TRIED,
BUT IT WAS ALL I HAD.

03:58.909 --> 04:01.712
I THOUGHT THAT
IF I COULD FIND THE KILLER

04:01.712 --> 04:03.944
AND PLANT THE NECKLACE
BACK ON THEM,

04:03.944 --> 04:06.947
THAT MAYBE I'D BE ABLE
TO CLEAR MY NAME.

04:08.319 --> 04:09.780
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.382
WELL, THE NECKLACE
IS GONE NOW.

04:11.382 --> 04:13.484
IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,

04:13.484 --> 04:15.956
THEN THE POLICE
WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.789
"IF."

04:18.789 --> 04:21.392
THERE IT IS.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.994
"IF."

04:31.872 --> 04:35.876
( theme music playing )

04:48.859 --> 04:51.962
JO, WHAT THE HELL?
THE CIVIL WAR WAS
JUST ABOUT TO START.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.395
RICO, ENOUGH.
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME
SINCE FALL FEST.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.826
ARE YOU MAD AT ME
OR SOMETHING?

04:55.826 --> 04:59.500
NO, IT WAS JUST
KIND OF A WEIRD NIGHT.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.502
WEIRD HOW?
BECAUSE OF DANNY.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.803
I DON'T KNOW, SORT OF.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.005
CAN WE JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING?

05:05.005 --> 05:08.939
OKAY, LOOK.

05:08.939 --> 05:10.941
I GET
THAT YOU DON'T TRUST HIM,

05:10.941 --> 05:13.984
AND THAT'S--
I MEAN, THAT SUCKS.

05:13.984 --> 05:17.448
BUT I JUST WANT ANYTHING
TO GET BETWEEN YOU AND I.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.420
AND ME.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.792
ME IS THE OBJECT
OF THE PREPOSITION
"BETWEEN," SO...

05:21.792 --> 05:24.495
- OKAY, I HATE YOU, SO...
- ( laughs )

05:26.597 --> 05:30.731
SO NOW WHAT?
JUST YOU AND DANNY

05:30.731 --> 05:32.863
TRYING TO CLEAR HIS NAME
TOGETHER?

05:32.863 --> 05:35.035
JUST THE TWO OF YOU
ON THE CASE?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.868
- WHY ARE YOU BEING WEIRD?
- NO REASON.

05:37.868 --> 05:41.642
I JUST SAW THE WAY
YOU WERE LOOKING AT HIM
AT FALL FEST.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.445
DANNY IS MY...

05:46.116 --> 05:48.118
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

05:48.118 --> 05:50.451
YEAH, A FRIEND YOU WANT
TO MATE WITH.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.624
MATE?
DO I LOOK LIKE A ZEBRA?

05:53.624 --> 05:55.656
NO, BUT YOU LOOK
LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS A CRUSH.

05:55.656 --> 05:59.460
I'M JUST HELPING HIM PROVE
HE DIDN'T KILL REGINA.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.863
AND WE MAY HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING THAT COULD PROVE IT.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.965
WAIT, WHAT DID YOU GUYS FIND?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.938
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.775
JO, LET'S SAY
SOMEONE FINDS SOMETHING
OR SEES SOMETHING

06:14.775 --> 06:18.779
THAT DOESN'T
CLEAR HIS NAME,
OR UNCLEARS IT WORSE,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.851
OR MAKES IT LESS CLEAR...

06:20.851 --> 06:24.615
OKAY, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
HOW I'D REACT IF DANNY DID IT,

06:24.615 --> 06:26.517
I MEAN, I'D BE DEVASTATED.

06:26.517 --> 06:29.990
BUT TRUST ME,
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW,
SOMEONE ELSE KILLED REGINA.

06:34.595 --> 06:38.098
- HEY, LACEY,
ANY NEW INFO?
- NO, NOT YET.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.601
JO'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD EITHER
GO TO THE POLICE

06:40.601 --> 06:43.704
WITH THE CASH AND THE NOTE,
OR, I DON'T KNOW,
DO SOMETHING NOW.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.507
WHAT IF WE WENT THERE?
WHAT IF WE WENT TO THAT ADDRESS
IN CONNECTICUT?

06:46.507 --> 06:49.810
GREAT IDEA.
LET'S KNOCK ON THE DOOR
AND ASK WHY THEY SENT THAT NOTE.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.613
OH, WHILE WE'RE THERE,
LET'S ASK IF THEY MURDERED
REGINA AND TOOK HER NECKLACE.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.145
WELL, AT LEAST WE'LL
FIND OUT WHO LIVES THERE.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.989
WHAT? YOU'RE AFRAID
SOMETHING ELSE MIGHT HAPPEN?

06:58.989 --> 07:01.752
DANNY, I ALREADY TOLD YOU
THAT KISS WAS A MISTAKE.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.454
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

07:03.454 --> 07:05.996
YEAH, I'M VERY AWARE
OF THAT, LACEY.

07:05.996 --> 07:08.158
FINE, I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT 8:00.

07:08.158 --> 07:10.000
OKAY, GREAT,
I'LL BRING SNACKS.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.703
BRING SNACKS WHERE?

07:12.703 --> 07:15.736
ME AND LACEY
ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING
ON A LITTLE ROAD TRIP TONIGHT.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.739
ROAD TRIP TO WHERE?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.171
TO THAT APARTMENT
IN CONNECTICUT?

07:21.171 --> 07:22.813
WOW,
THAT'S A REALLY STUPID IDEA.

07:22.813 --> 07:25.576
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.
- DIDN'T SAY THAT I WANTED TO.

07:25.576 --> 07:27.918
PLUS MY DAD
WOULD NEVER LET ME.

07:27.918 --> 07:29.880
HE'S BEEN SUPER TENSE
TOWARD ME SINCE FALL FEST.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.052
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

07:34.785 --> 07:37.528
HEY, YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH ALL THIS-- NOT GOING?

07:37.528 --> 07:41.492
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I MEAN, I'M REALLY
JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

07:41.492 --> 07:44.965
IF YOU LEAVE THE STATE,
AREN'T YOU VIOLATING
YOUR PROBATION?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.968
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE FINE.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.649
( phone vibrating )

08:05.956 --> 08:08.258
I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE STATION TONIGHT.

08:08.258 --> 08:09.990
OKAY.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.262
MIGHT BE LATE AGAIN.
I HAVE A LOT OF PAPERWORK
TO CATCH UP ON.

08:12.262 --> 08:14.525
I BET.

08:14.525 --> 08:15.996
JUST SET IT DOWN.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.270
HEY, I'M HEADING
TO THE DINER TO MEET RICO.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.903
- OKAY, DON'T BE LATE.
- HOLD UP, THE DINER?

08:22.903 --> 08:26.106
YEAH, RICO'S THERE NOW.
HE'S WAITING FOR ME.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.678
- SO GOTTA RUN.
- UH-HUH.

08:27.678 --> 08:31.842
ISN'T JOHNNY CAKES CLOSED
TONIGHT FOR A PRIVATE PARTY?

08:31.842 --> 08:34.715
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME THAT, JO.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.016
( laughs )

08:36.016 --> 08:37.848
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

08:37.848 --> 08:40.551
I MEANT AT SCHOOL.
THEY'RE OPEN LATE ON TUESDAYS.

08:40.551 --> 08:44.254
DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY
THAT RICO WAS AT THE DINER NOW
WAITING FOR YOU?

08:44.254 --> 08:47.928
SHE GOT CONFUSED, KYLE.
LET HER GO.

08:50.701 --> 08:53.303
IF YOU WANT TO STUDY,
STUDY HERE.

08:53.303 --> 08:54.605
BUT--

08:54.605 --> 08:58.008
SORRY, HONEY.
YOUR FATHER HAS SPOKEN.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.955
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.987
I'M SORRY.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

09:16.987 --> 09:20.190
- I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
TO GO KILL SOMEONE.
- ( sighs )

09:20.190 --> 09:22.863
LACEY'S PICKING ME UP.
WE'RE GOING FOR A DRIVE.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.035
THAT'S GREAT.

09:25.035 --> 09:26.697
YEAH.

09:26.697 --> 09:28.568
DANNY?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.673
COME ON.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.345
HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.763
YEAH, MOM,
I'LL HAVE THE CAR BACK
BY 11:00, I PROMISE.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.795
OKAY, BYE.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.797
( phone beeps )

10:01.031 --> 10:03.974
- ( sighs )
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:03.974 --> 10:06.376
YEAH, JUST STUFF
WITH MY MOTHER.

10:06.376 --> 10:09.009
ACTUALLY, CAN WE
HOLD ON A SECOND?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.081
WHY?

10:11.081 --> 10:12.743
I DIDN'T--

10:15.946 --> 10:17.888
HEY, THANKS FOR WAITING.

10:17.888 --> 10:20.220
YOU DECIDED TO COME.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.952
SHE DECIDED TO COME.

10:21.952 --> 10:24.925
YEAH, SHE JUST TEXTED ME.
YOU SURE YOUR DAD'S
OKAY WITH THIS?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.097
HE'LL BE FINE.

10:27.097 --> 10:29.900
BUT HEY,
IF I'M CROWDING YOU...

10:31.261 --> 10:33.934
IT'S FINE, JO.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.236
I'M GLAD, LACEY.

10:40.711 --> 10:43.313
( car starts )

10:52.723 --> 10:54.955
OH, KAREN.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.087
HEY, COME IN.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.730
SORRY TO JUST DROP IN
LIKE THIS.

10:59.730 --> 11:02.062
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:02.062 --> 11:04.164
NO, ACTUALLY.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.296
JO TOOK OFF TONIGHT
WITHOUT TELLING US.

11:06.296 --> 11:09.369
RICO ISN'T ANSWERING EITHER.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.702
KYLE.

11:13.804 --> 11:17.047
UH, SO DANNY TOLD ME
THAT HE SIGNED UP FOR
YOUR POTTERY CLASS

11:17.047 --> 11:20.050
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU GOT PAID.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.152
THANK YOU, KAREN.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US?

11:22.152 --> 11:24.154
WE'RE HAVING
A SMALL FAMILY CRISIS.

11:24.154 --> 11:26.016
TESS TOLD ME.

11:26.016 --> 11:28.889
AND IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT JO IS WITH DANNY AND LACEY.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.192
THEY WENT DRIVING OFF
SOMEWHERE.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.394
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
JO'S WITH THEM.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.966
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:35.966 --> 11:38.068
TO TRACK DOWN OUR DAUGHTER
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE

11:38.068 --> 11:39.970
AND ASSUME SHE'S PERFECT
AND NEVER LIES?

11:39.970 --> 11:42.833
I'M SORRY IF I WANT TO GIVE HER
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

11:42.833 --> 11:45.175
I'M SORRY
IF I DON'T.

11:51.882 --> 11:53.844
Jo:
MAYBE SHE WAS
BLACKMAILING SOMEONE.

11:53.844 --> 11:56.186
BLACKMAILING?
REGINA WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

11:56.186 --> 11:58.218
IT'S JUST A THEORY.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.051
MUSIC ANYONE?

12:01.051 --> 12:03.153
OKAY THEN.

12:04.494 --> 12:06.196
( static )

12:06.196 --> 12:08.999
- ( rock song playing )
- OH, MAN!

12:08.999 --> 12:10.831
REMEMBER THIS SONG?
WE LOVED THIS SONG.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.132
WHAT WAS THIS,
LIKE, THIRD GRADE?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.433
Both:
FOURTH.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.907
( song continues )

12:16.907 --> 12:19.139
♪ HERE IT GOES, HERE IT GOES,
HERE IT GOES AGAIN... ♪

12:19.139 --> 12:21.271
THE BASS--
♪ OH, HERE IT GOES AGAIN ♪

12:21.271 --> 12:22.913
♪ I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN,
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ♪

12:22.913 --> 12:24.744
- ♪ I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN... ♪
- THERE IT IS.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.977
I DON'T REMEMBER THE WORDS.
I DON'T REMEMBER THE WORDS.

12:26.977 --> 12:28.979
♪ Oh, here it goes again... ♪

12:28.979 --> 12:31.351
OH, REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY
THAT WE HEARD THIS SONG.
WHEN WAS THAT?

12:31.351 --> 12:35.956
UH, WE'D JUST GOTTEN BACK
FROM SLEDDING AT MOHAWK HILL.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.990
- THAT WAS A GREAT DAY.
- YEAH.

12:39.990 --> 12:43.263
THAT WAS THE TIME
YOU GUYS FORCED ME TO SIT
IN THE FRONT OF THE SLED.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.396
I REMEMBER 'CAUSE
I GOT CREAMED EVERY TIME
WE CRASHED INTO THE SNOW BANK.

12:46.396 --> 12:49.239
GOD, I BASICALLY HAD, LIKE,
HYPOTHERMIA WHEN WE GOT BACK.

12:49.239 --> 12:51.271
HYPOTHERMIA, RIGHT.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.104
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:54.104 --> 12:56.776
- NOTHING,
YOU'RE JUST SUCH A VICTIM.
- EXCUSE ME?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.248
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE HOT CHOCOLATE?

12:58.248 --> 13:00.280
THAT WAS-- WHEW!
SOME GOOD HOT CHOCOLATE.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.352
YOU CHOSE TO SIT
IN THE FRONT OF THE SLED, JO.

13:02.352 --> 13:05.215
ACTUALLY, NO, I DIDN'T,
BUT THANKS FOR PLAYING.

13:05.215 --> 13:08.258
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
ONE MORE TIME FOR
THE CHEAP SEATS.

13:08.258 --> 13:10.360
- LET'S DO THIS.
- ( turns radio up )

13:10.360 --> 13:13.964
( singing along )
♪ OH, HERE IT GOES,
HERE IT GOES, HERE IT... ♪

13:13.964 --> 13:15.966
♪ Oh, here it goes again ♪

13:15.966 --> 13:18.929

13:22.002 --> 13:24.104
UH, MR. MASTERSON.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.837
CHIEF MASTERSON, SIR.

13:26.837 --> 13:29.209
- AM I UNDER ARREST?
- I WAS HOPING JO WAS WITH YOU.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.882
OH, NO, JO AND I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PLANS TO STUDY TONIGHT.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.486
UNLESS SHE SAID
WE HAD PLANS TO STUDY TONIGHT,

13:36.486 --> 13:38.989
IN WHICH CASE,
JO IS LATE.

13:38.989 --> 13:41.121
DARN HER.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.155
WHY ARE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT HER?

13:45.155 --> 13:47.157
SHE TOOK OFF
WITHOUT TELLING ME,

13:47.157 --> 13:48.899
MOST LIKELY TO DRIVE AROUND
GOD-KNOWS-WHERE

13:48.899 --> 13:50.430
WITH DANNY DESAI
AND LACEY PORTER.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.163
WOULD YOU TEXT HER, PLEASE?
MAYBE SHE'LL RESPOND TO YOU.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.835
"JO,

13:55.835 --> 13:59.970
WHERE ARE YOU
RIGHT NOW?

13:59.970 --> 14:02.272
JUST CURIOUS."

14:02.272 --> 14:03.513
YOU REALLY
DON'T NEED TO NARRATE.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.276
OH, RIGHT, I WAS JUST,
SO YOU-- SEND.

14:08.118 --> 14:10.050
SO WHERE DO YOU
GET THOSE JACKETS?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.082
CLEAN--
THEY'RE REALLY CRISP.

14:12.082 --> 14:13.123
( phone vibrates )

14:13.123 --> 14:15.155
UH...

14:15.155 --> 14:17.888
"ARE YOU WITH MY DAD?"

14:17.888 --> 14:21.061
WELL, I CAN'T LIE
TO JO, SIR.

14:23.133 --> 14:26.897
WELL, IF YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING
OR HEAR ANYTHING, CALL ME, OKAY?

14:31.902 --> 14:33.403
CHIEF MASTERSON?

14:33.403 --> 14:35.205
YEAH?

14:37.107 --> 14:39.950
PROTECT AND SERVE, SIR.

14:54.064 --> 14:56.066
GET HOME SOON, PLEASE.

14:56.066 --> 14:58.168
WE'RE HAVING
A SERIOUS DISCUSSION
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

14:58.168 --> 15:00.170
( beeps )

15:00.170 --> 15:01.371
( sighs )

15:01.371 --> 15:03.203
EVERYTHING OKAY?

15:03.203 --> 15:06.436
YOU WERE RIGHT.
SHE'S WITH DANNY AND LACEY,

15:06.436 --> 15:09.579
GOING FOR A DRIVE,
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

15:09.579 --> 15:14.144
I REALLY HOPE DANNY
HASN'T CAUSED TOO MANY ISSUES
FOR YOU AND KYLE, WITH JO.

15:14.144 --> 15:19.019
SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE
OUR LITTLE DISAGREEMENT.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.121
( laughs )
THAT WAS NOTHING.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.323
VIKRAM AND I USED TO
HAVE EPIC BATTLES.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.655
HE DID HAVE A TEMPER.

15:25.655 --> 15:30.330
YEAH, WE HAD--
WE HAD A BAD ONE
THE DAY HE DIED.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.362
HE HAD BEEN DRINKING

15:32.362 --> 15:35.635
AND I TOLD HIM
NOT TO TAKE THE BOAT OUT.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.938
VIK WAS STUBBORN.

15:40.570 --> 15:44.444
JUST LIKE KYLE.
AND JO, FOR THAT MATTER.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.346
MMM, DON'T FORGET DANNY.

15:48.118 --> 15:50.550
HE'S LUCKY TO HAVE JO.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.622
SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

15:56.126 --> 15:58.128
IS THAT ONE OF YOURS?

15:58.128 --> 15:59.159
IT IS.

15:59.159 --> 16:02.462
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.494
I'VE ALWAYS ENVIED
YOUR TALENT.

16:04.494 --> 16:07.367
I STILL HAVE
A VASE YOU MADE.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.698
REALLY?

16:08.698 --> 16:11.171
YEAH, FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS,
I'D PASS IT AND THINK,

16:11.171 --> 16:15.005
I REALLY HATE THAT BITCH,
BUT SHE SURE CAN MAKE
A GOOD VASE.

16:15.005 --> 16:17.177
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BRING UP--

16:17.177 --> 16:19.349
IT'S OKAY.
I'M TOUCHED YOU'VE KEPT IT.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.281
I'VE ALWAYS WISHED
I COULD MAKE ONE.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.682
WANT TO LEARN?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.317
FIFTH ANGRY TEXT FROM MY DAD
IN UNDER AN HOUR.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.989
I'M SO DEAD
WHEN I GET HOME.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.163
OH,
"WELCOME TO CONNECTICUT."

16:33.163 --> 16:35.495
( music playing )

16:35.495 --> 16:38.498
AND TO OFFICIALLY VIOLATING
MY PROBATION.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.031
( cellphone ringing )

16:42.172 --> 16:44.374
OH, IT'S SARITA.
YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER IT?

16:44.374 --> 16:46.176
I THINK
THAT I SHOULD ANSWER IT.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.238
I MISS THAT ADORABLE
LITTLE SARITA.

16:48.238 --> 16:51.010
I GET IT, JO--
YOU HATE MY FRIENDS.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.642
I JUST SAID
THAT SHE WAS ADORABLE.

16:52.642 --> 16:54.184
JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?

16:54.184 --> 16:55.545
DID YOU JUST TELL ME
TO SHUT UP?

16:55.545 --> 16:57.547
HEY, SHH SHH!
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS,
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

16:57.547 --> 17:00.320
- WHAT?
- THERE'S A SOUND COMING
FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.652
LACEY, PULL OVER.
PULL OVER.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.234
OKAY, LET ME JUST
CHECK THIS OUT, OKAY?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.365
BE RIGHT BACK.

17:19.109 --> 17:22.172
HEY, JO,
CAN YOU BRING YOUR CELLPHONE?
I NEED SOME LIGHT.

17:27.817 --> 17:31.281
WHAT IS IT?
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

17:31.281 --> 17:33.323
DOES YOUR TAILPIPE
ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS?

17:33.323 --> 17:35.155
IT LOOKS NORMAL TO ME.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.288
NO NO, LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

17:38.288 --> 17:39.759
YOU GOT SOME STUFF THERE.
LOOK AT THAT.

17:42.192 --> 17:45.235
- I DON'T--
- THERE'S A LOT OF RUST
IN THERE.

17:45.235 --> 17:47.467
- IT'S AN OLD CAR.
- ( doors lock )

17:47.467 --> 17:49.469
- DANNY!
- WHAT THE HELL?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.844
OH, I'M SORRY.
DID YOU GUYS WANT
TO GET INSIDE?

17:54.844 --> 17:56.776
- ( door rattles )
- MAKE UP FIRST.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.613
( sighs )

18:13.593 --> 18:15.825
DANNY, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S FREEZING.

18:15.825 --> 18:18.528
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT
IT WAS COLDER WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE INSIDE THE CAR.

18:18.528 --> 18:20.230
OH, BECAUSE WE WERE FIGHTING.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.406
I DON'T GET IT.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.608
HEY, NO NO NO NO NO NO.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.141
WE'RE ALL FINALLY
ON THE SAME PAGE HERE

18:31.141 --> 18:33.543
AND YOU GUYS ARE BITING
EACH OTHER'S HEADS OFF.
JO, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

18:33.543 --> 18:35.485
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
IT'S FINE.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.847
LACEY,

18:37.847 --> 18:40.350
YOU KNOW THE NIGHT
OF OUR SLEEPOVER?

18:40.350 --> 18:42.552
YOU SAID MIDDLE SCHOOL
WAS ROUGH

18:42.552 --> 18:44.494
AND YOU DID WHAT
YOU HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE.
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

18:44.494 --> 18:47.457
WE JUST STOPPED
BEING FRIENDS, OKAY?

18:49.529 --> 18:51.161
IS THAT TRUE, JO?

18:51.161 --> 18:53.603
YEAH, SURE.

18:53.603 --> 18:56.666
DANNY, PLEASE, ENOUGH.
LET US IN.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.339
NO, NOT UNTIL YOU GUYS
MAKE NICE.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.471
( sighs )

19:04.474 --> 19:06.676
JO?

19:08.518 --> 19:10.380
I'M REALLY SORRY.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.524
I'M SORRY TOO.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.757
( unlocks )

19:20.260 --> 19:23.433
LET ME KNOW
IF ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS
SPOTS THE CAR, OKAY?

19:23.433 --> 19:24.634
THANKS, STEVE.

19:24.634 --> 19:26.466
- ( beeps )
- ANYTHING SHOW UP?

19:26.466 --> 19:29.299
EXCUSE ME?
HI, UH, CHIEF MASTERSON.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.771
I JUST, UM, WANT YOU TO KNOW
I HEARD FROM JO AGAIN.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.773
SHE'S WITH DANNY AND LACEY,
I KNOW.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.676
- SHE CALLED HER MOTHER.
- OH, GOOD. OKAY.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.580
UM, WELL, SHE SAID
THEY'LL BE BACK TONIGHT
AND EVERYTHING IS FINE.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.811
AND SHE'S VERY SORRY.

19:41.811 --> 19:43.883
TRUST ME--
SHE WILL BE SORRY.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.485
GOOD NIGHT, RICO.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.561
UH, DO YOU ACTUALLY MIND
IF I HANG OUT?

19:51.561 --> 19:53.793
I FIND
ALL THIS POLICE STUFF COOL--

19:53.793 --> 19:55.895
CASES, MURDERS,
CRIMES, ROBBERIES.

19:55.895 --> 19:59.469
I CAN'T DISCUSS
MY CASES WITH YOU.

19:59.469 --> 20:01.471
OH, YEAH, I KNOW.

20:01.471 --> 20:04.404
I, UM, YOU KNOW,
ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
JO'S OKAY.

20:06.476 --> 20:08.578
UNLESS YOU WERE HEADING HOME.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.883
I COULD USE THE COMPANY
FOR A BIT.

20:21.891 --> 20:24.454
NICE JOB.

20:24.454 --> 20:26.626
ADD MORE WATER
IF YOU NEED TO.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.960
THERAPEUTIC, HUH?

20:30.960 --> 20:32.862
YEAH, AND SLIMY.

20:32.862 --> 20:34.704
( laughs )

20:34.704 --> 20:36.606
YOU'RE NOT BAD.

20:36.606 --> 20:38.438
YOU SEEM SHOCKED.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.271
WELL,
YOU'VE JUST NEVER SEEMED

20:41.271 --> 20:43.943
LIKE THE DOWN-AND-DIRTY
CLAY-IN-HER-NAILS TYPE.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.846
THAT'S TRUE.
VIKRAM USED TO--

20:48.418 --> 20:51.881
SORRY. I KEEP TALKING
ABOUT MY DEAD HUSBAND.

20:51.881 --> 20:53.623
MORBID, HUH?

20:53.623 --> 20:56.556
IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX MONTHS,
KAREN.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.529
GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

20:59.529 --> 21:01.991
IT'S EASIER
TO NOT TALK ABOUT HIM.

21:01.991 --> 21:04.834
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULDN'T.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.999
YOU AND VIKRAM TOOK CERAMICS
TOGETHER IN HIGH SCHOOL, RIGHT?

21:09.999 --> 21:13.503
YEAH, IT'S WHERE WE FIRST MET.

21:13.503 --> 21:14.674
WAS THAT WHEN YOU TWO DATED?

21:14.674 --> 21:18.778
OH, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.651
WE ONLY DATED
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.883
YOU'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.555
NOW YOU WANT
TO USE YOUR THUMB,

21:25.555 --> 21:27.557
START TO MAKE
A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.

21:27.557 --> 21:30.620
I THINK
THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU
WAS AT VIKRAM'S HOUSE

21:30.620 --> 21:32.892
AFTER HE AND I
STARTED DATING, REMEMBER?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.864
( laughs )

21:34.864 --> 21:39.699
WOW, WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED
ALL THINGS WE'D GO THROUGH
TOGETHER AFTER THAT?

21:39.699 --> 21:42.532
I WENT TO HIS HOUSE
TO GET SOMETHING THAT NIGHT,
DIDN'T I?

21:42.532 --> 21:44.404
( laughs )

21:44.404 --> 21:46.305
YOU DID.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.008
- NO.
- COME ON, TESS.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.510
MY STASH.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.542
WE GOT SO HIGH THAT NIGHT.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.844
OH, THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

21:54.844 --> 21:57.947
SOMETIMES I WISH
I COULD GO BACK THERE.

21:57.947 --> 22:00.490
YOU SORT OF CAN...

22:00.490 --> 22:02.552
GO BACK, I MEAN.

22:02.552 --> 22:06.456
I STILL KIND OF HAVE ONE--
A STASH.

22:07.557 --> 22:09.028
DOES KYLE KNOW?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.530
ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:10.530 --> 22:13.433
- HE'D PROBABLY ARREST ME.
- ( laughs )

22:13.433 --> 22:18.037
JUST SOMETIMES
WHEN KYLE'S WORKING LATE
AND JO'S ASLEEP,

22:18.037 --> 22:20.770
I ACCESS IT

22:20.770 --> 22:22.442
FOR INSPIRATION.

22:26.576 --> 22:28.578
WHERE DO YOU KEEP IT?

22:43.963 --> 22:47.036
SHALL WE?

22:55.405 --> 22:57.847
CAN I HELP YOU GUYS?

22:59.679 --> 23:02.051
THIS CAME TO US
FROM APARTMENT 413,

23:02.051 --> 23:03.913
BUT THERE WAS NO NAME
ON THE RETURN ADDRESS.

23:03.913 --> 23:05.755
WHO LIVES THERE?

23:05.755 --> 23:09.559
413? REALLY?

23:11.120 --> 23:15.595
ANY WAY WE CAN JUST GO UP
AND SEE WHOEVER LIVES THERE,

23:15.595 --> 23:18.598
- TALK WITH HIM FOR A SECOND?
- OR HER.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.770
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME
YOU KIDS ARE PLAYING,

23:20.770 --> 23:23.673
BUT I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TONIGHT,
ALL RIGHT? NOW GO ON.

23:29.178 --> 23:32.742
GREAT PLAN, JO.
HOLDING UP THE ENVELOPE
REALLY WORKED.

23:32.742 --> 23:35.845
LIKE YOURS WOULD HAVE BEEN
ANY BETTER-- JUST WALK IN,
ACT LIKE WE LIVE THERE.

23:35.845 --> 23:37.517
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL WE?

23:37.517 --> 23:39.519
AS MUCH AS I'M ENJOYING
THIS LITTLE WITTY REPARTEE,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.891
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING
TO HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO LIVES
IN THAT APARTMENT.

23:41.891 --> 23:44.524
GOD, THIS TRIP
WAS SUCH A STUPID IDEA.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.526
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.
- OKAY, JUST--

23:46.526 --> 23:49.028
WOW, NOT WANTING
TO INVITE ME ALONG--
WHAT A LACEY PORTER ORIGINAL.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.030
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

23:51.030 --> 23:53.432
YOU WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT MIDDLE SCHOOL?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.505
NO, I--
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK I--

23:55.505 --> 23:57.537
AMBER KLEIN'S
13th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

23:57.537 --> 24:01.010
DOES THAT RING ANY BELLS
FOR YOU, LACEY?

24:01.010 --> 24:03.042
WELL, I WAS THE ONLY PERSON
THAT WASN'T INVITED,

24:03.042 --> 24:05.975
WHICH NORMALLY
I WOULDN'T HAVE CARED,

24:05.975 --> 24:08.117
BUT WHEN THE ENTIRE CLASS
IS INVITED

24:08.117 --> 24:10.980
AND YOU AREN'T,
IT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS.

24:10.980 --> 24:13.022
RIGHT, LACEY?

24:13.022 --> 24:14.954
SO I CONFRONTED AMBER,
AND SHE SAID

24:14.954 --> 24:18.057
LACEY PORTER ASKED HER
NOT TO INVITE ME,

24:18.057 --> 24:20.730
SAID THAT I'D RUIN
THE ENTIRE PARTY.

24:22.792 --> 24:26.195
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU WERE SO DIFFICULT
TO BE AROUND...

24:27.537 --> 24:30.500
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.643
YOU MADE EVERYONE
AROUND YOU MISERABLE, OKAY?

24:33.643 --> 24:35.244
EXCUSE ME
FOR BEING TRAUMATIZED.

24:35.244 --> 24:38.107
I WAS TRAUMATIZED TOO,
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

24:38.107 --> 24:40.510
GOD, JO, I WAS 13.
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN.

24:40.510 --> 24:42.582
SO DID I.
YOU DON'T THINK I WANTED
TO HAVE FUN, LACEY?

24:42.582 --> 24:44.183
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT YOU,
ISN'T IT?

24:44.183 --> 24:45.715
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT YOU.

24:45.715 --> 24:48.057
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
I TRIED SO HARD
TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

24:48.057 --> 24:49.589
NO, YOU DIDN'T!

24:49.589 --> 24:51.521
I WAS WEIGHING YOU DOWN,
SO YOU JUST CUT ME LOOSE.

24:51.521 --> 24:54.624
THERE YOU GO AGAIN--
JO MASTERSON, ALWAYS THE VICTIM.

24:54.624 --> 24:57.667
LACEY PORTER--
ALWAYS POPULAR, PERFECT, FUN.

24:57.667 --> 25:00.199
YOU COULDN'T LET ANYONE
GET IN THE WAY OF THAT,
COULD YOU?

25:00.199 --> 25:04.574
NOT EVEN THE ONE PERSON
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

25:22.752 --> 25:24.754
I CHECKED THE SIDE DOORS
AND THE BACK--

25:24.754 --> 25:27.126
THEY'RE ALL LOCKED.
NO WAY IN YET.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.559
WE NEED A PLAN.

25:36.065 --> 25:38.708
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.775
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID
TO ASK YOU

25:45.775 --> 25:48.117
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND LACEY.

25:48.117 --> 25:50.750
I JUST-- I KNEW
IT WAS CONNECTED TO WHAT I DID.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.782
LACEY MADE HER OWN CHOICES.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.956
YOU WEREN'T AFRAID
TO ASK HER.

25:58.327 --> 26:02.331
THAT NIGHT, YOUR--
YOUR SLEEPOVER.

26:02.331 --> 26:05.735
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I--

26:05.735 --> 26:08.738
I SAID TO LACEY
THAT NIGHT?

26:08.738 --> 26:10.740
I SAID,

26:10.740 --> 26:15.004
I DON'T KNOW IF I REGRET
WHAT I DID FIVE YEARS AGO.

26:15.004 --> 26:18.708
BUT I-- I REGRET
HURTING YOU TWO...

26:20.579 --> 26:23.082
RUINING YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

26:25.915 --> 26:28.157
AND I MEAN THAT, OKAY?

26:30.920 --> 26:33.262
I CARE ABOUT YOU GUYS
SO MUCH.

26:33.262 --> 26:36.095
I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO.

26:37.767 --> 26:41.871
LACEY AND I--
WE BOTH CARE ABOUT YOU.

26:41.871 --> 26:43.773
- ( door opens )
- Guard: HEY!

26:43.773 --> 26:46.605
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING,
BUT THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.738
EITHER GET OUT
OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

26:50.039 --> 26:51.210
- ( car door closes )
- ( car starts )

26:51.210 --> 26:53.683
- OKAY.
- GO NOW!

27:04.123 --> 27:06.926
- WHOOPS!
- ( radio playing )

27:06.926 --> 27:09.859
TRUST ME,
ONCE YOU PUT IT IN THE KILN,

27:09.859 --> 27:11.961
ALL THE FLAWS,
THEY JUST GO POOF!

27:11.961 --> 27:15.334
POOF.
WHAT A WEIRD WORD.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.667
- POOF!
- Both: POOF.

27:17.667 --> 27:20.109
- POOF.
- POO POO POO POOF!

27:20.109 --> 27:22.972
- OH!
- ( laughing )

27:24.143 --> 27:27.146
KAREN, I WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.120
I WANT TO SAY
THAT YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOTHER.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.252
PERIOD.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.024
OH, TESS.

27:35.024 --> 27:39.959
OH, THAT IS THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.962
IT WAS SO MEAN
WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.393
IT WAS MEAN.

27:44.393 --> 27:46.295
IT MADE ME FROWN.

27:46.295 --> 27:48.868
( laughing )

27:48.868 --> 27:51.240
OH, YOU KNOW WHO IS
KIND OF A BAD MOTHER, THOUGH?

27:51.240 --> 27:53.372
HELEN BERG.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.405
HELEN BERG, YES!

27:56.405 --> 27:57.877
( laughing )

27:57.877 --> 28:00.179
I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.712
SHE WAS A GRADE ABOVE US
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

28:02.712 --> 28:06.055
OH, GOD, WAS SHE THE ONE
WITH THE GREEN HAIR?

28:06.055 --> 28:09.218
YES!
( laughing )

28:09.218 --> 28:11.020
ONLY THAT ONE TIME

28:11.020 --> 28:13.823
FOR THAT ST. PATRICK'S DAY
PARTY SOPHOMORE YEAR.

28:13.823 --> 28:18.267
OH. OH, GOD.
I REMEMBER THAT PARTY.

28:18.267 --> 28:20.830
I LOVED THAT PARTY.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.873
OH, THAT WAS THE TIME
VIKRAM AND I

28:23.873 --> 28:26.906
KEPT SNEAKING OFF
INTO THE COAT CLOSET TO--

28:26.906 --> 28:27.907
WHAT?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.781
- TO WHAT?
- ( laughs )

28:31.781 --> 28:33.913
YOU AND VIK
WEREN'T TOGETHER THEN.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.915
THAT'S--
VIK AND I STARTED TO--

28:37.847 --> 28:40.019
I--

28:41.420 --> 28:43.923
POOF.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.925
OKAY. UM...

28:45.925 --> 28:48.227
WELL, OUT OF CURIOSITY,

28:48.227 --> 28:50.199
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU GUYS--

28:50.199 --> 28:52.832
OH, JUST THAT ONE TIME, KAREN.

28:52.832 --> 28:53.903
MM-HMM.

28:53.903 --> 28:57.867
AND A FEW MORE

28:57.867 --> 28:59.208
AFTER THAT.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.871
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.

29:01.871 --> 29:06.315
VIK AND I-- IT WAS ALWAYS
JUST SILLY AND FUN.

29:06.315 --> 29:09.748
FUN? UNLIKE ME?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.821
OH, COME ON.

29:11.821 --> 29:14.283
I DON'T LIKE
BEING LIED TO, TESS.

29:14.283 --> 29:19.128
I NEVER LIED.
I JUST WITHHELD.

29:19.128 --> 29:20.860
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I AM SUCH AN IDIOT.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.231
HERE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TRUSTWORTHY.

29:22.231 --> 29:23.963
I AM TRUSTWORTHY.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.135
- KAREN--
- SAVE IT.

29:26.135 --> 29:29.268
- IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.
- I DON'T CARE.

29:31.941 --> 29:33.843
( crunching )

29:33.843 --> 29:36.976
THIS IS SUCH A COOL PHOTO
OF YOU GUYS.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.848
WHERE WAS THIS?

29:38.848 --> 29:42.351
MAINE. WE RENTED A CABIN
IN LITTLE DIAMOND ISLAND.

29:42.351 --> 29:44.783
JO MUST HAVE BEEN EIGHT.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.555
( laughs )
MAN, LOOK HOW HARD
SHE'S LAUGHING.

29:46.555 --> 29:48.918
I MADE HER LAUGH
LIKE THAT ONCE.

29:48.918 --> 29:51.520
IT WAS UNINTENTIONAL.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.562
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND
TO JO, RICO.

29:53.562 --> 29:55.194
THANKS.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.796
YOU TOO. UM, YOU'RE A,
YOU KNOW, GOOD DAD.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.529
I'M NOT SO SURE
SHE WOULD AGREE.

30:00.529 --> 30:04.203
SHE AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN THE BEST PLACE LATELY.

30:04.203 --> 30:07.877
YEAH, I BET IT'S BEEN TOUGH
WITH THE WHOLE TRYING
TO SOLVE THIS CASE

30:07.877 --> 30:10.439
AND, YOU KNOW, HER AND DANNY
BEING ALL BUDDY-BUDDY.

30:10.439 --> 30:12.181
"OH, OUR CHILDHOODS."

30:12.181 --> 30:14.884
AND THEN AFTER,
YOU KNOW, YOU NOT BEING ABLE
TO FIND THAT NECKLACE.

30:14.884 --> 30:16.815
( exhales )

30:16.815 --> 30:20.920
UH, DANNY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE NECKLACE TOO.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.591
DID HE?

30:23.893 --> 30:25.955
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

30:25.955 --> 30:28.457
UH, YOU KNOW, NOT MUCH.

30:28.457 --> 30:31.560
SO THE NECKLACE
IS YOUR ONLY LEAD?

30:31.560 --> 30:33.933
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT--

30:33.933 --> 30:35.404
YOUR CASE, I KNOW.

30:35.404 --> 30:39.338
BUT THAT RAID, THOUGH.
DID YOU LOOK EVERYWHERE?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.510
LIKE MAYBE HIS MOM'S ROOM?

30:41.510 --> 30:44.343
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
COULDN'T SHE HAVE BEEN
HIDING IT FOR HIM?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.445
I MEAN, SHE IS, YOU KNOW,
HIS MOM.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.017
SHE MIGHT DO THAT.

30:48.017 --> 30:51.280
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
ALL THESE QUESTIONS, RICO?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.352
YEAH, I'M JUST A MYSTERY BUFF.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.855
UM, I GOTTA HEAD OUT,
I THINK.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.487
ALREADY?
YOU JUST GOT HERE.

30:58.487 --> 31:01.360
HOW ABOUT SOME SNACKS
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE?
MY TREAT.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.862
WHAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE?
SWEET OR SALTY?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.966
UM, SALTY?

31:14.273 --> 31:17.907
Danny:
OKAY, STOP STOP STOP.
THERE'S LIKE A DOORWAY THAT WAY.

31:19.648 --> 31:22.081
- STOP.
- DANNY, COME ON!

31:22.081 --> 31:24.083
THIS IS CRAZY.
WE HAVE TO GET HOME.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.085
WE CAME ALL THIS WAY.
WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA TRY AGAIN?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.616
COME ON, MY PARENTS
ARE HOME FREAKING OUT,

31:27.616 --> 31:29.458
LACEY HAS TO
GET HER CAR BACK.

31:29.458 --> 31:32.191
WE'RE JUST-- WE'RE SO CLOSE.
WE JUST NEED TO FIND
A WAY INSIDE.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.964
HE THREATENED
TO CALL THE POLICE.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RISK THAT?

31:34.964 --> 31:37.666
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO LIVES IN THAT APARTMENT,
JUST NOT TONIGHT.

31:37.666 --> 31:41.931
NO. I NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT.
TONIGHT.

31:48.637 --> 31:51.580
LOOK, I KNOW
I CAN'T FORCE YOU TWO
TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.282
OKAY?

31:53.282 --> 31:55.614
BUT I NEED YOU,
BOTH OF YOU.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.917
SO PLEASE, DON'T--
DON'T BAIL ON ME

31:58.917 --> 32:01.951
LIKE YOU TWO
BAILED ON EACH OTHER.

32:16.605 --> 32:18.107
( door squeaking )

32:31.520 --> 32:33.182
( crunching )

32:33.182 --> 32:36.085
- Kyle: HOW IS THAT?
- SALTY.

32:38.957 --> 32:43.232
RICO, WHY WERE YOU
ASKING ME ALL THOSE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT NECKLACE?

32:45.394 --> 32:49.738
WELL, I-- I TOLD YOU,
MYSTERY EXCITES ME.

32:49.738 --> 32:52.241
THERE'S NOTHING YOU'RE KEEPING
FROM ME, IS THERE?

32:54.173 --> 32:56.445
RICO, LOOK AT ME.

32:59.108 --> 33:01.110
( gulps )

33:01.110 --> 33:03.512
I DON'T WANT TO HURT JO.

33:03.512 --> 33:05.654
HOW WOULD YOU HURT JO?

33:08.117 --> 33:12.091
IF WHAT I KNOW--
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL,

33:12.091 --> 33:15.994
SHE WOULD BE--

33:15.994 --> 33:18.097
SHE CARES ABOUT HIM
SO MUCH.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.398
WHO, DANNY?

33:20.669 --> 33:22.401
WHAT IF JO GOT HURT?

33:22.401 --> 33:25.174
NOT HER FEELINGS,
BUT FOR REAL HURT--
PHYSICALLY HURT.

33:25.174 --> 33:27.236
WHAT IF THAT HAPPENED
AND YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED IT

33:27.236 --> 33:28.707
BY TELLING ME WHAT YOU KNOW?

33:28.707 --> 33:31.710
I CARE ABOUT JO, RICO,

33:31.710 --> 33:35.013
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.387
AND IF YOU CARE ABOUT HER TOO,
YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

33:38.387 --> 33:42.391
BECAUSE WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE
IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

33:42.391 --> 33:44.653
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE--

33:44.653 --> 33:47.726
AN OFFENSE THAT COMES
WITH ACTUAL JAIL TIME.

33:49.798 --> 33:52.761
I HAVE TO GO.

34:45.584 --> 34:48.217
( clicking )

34:48.217 --> 34:49.858
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

34:55.364 --> 34:56.765
ANY SIGN OF HIM?

34:56.765 --> 34:59.698
HE SPENT FIVE YEARS IN JUVIE.
I THINK HE CAN HANDLE HIMSELF.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.203
JO--

35:04.203 --> 35:06.735
LACEY, LET'S NOT, OKAY?

35:06.735 --> 35:08.837
THAT WHOLE BLOW-UP WAS--

35:08.837 --> 35:11.140
THERE'S NO REASON
TO REHASH IT OR ANYTHING.
IT'S FINE.

35:11.140 --> 35:14.112
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK
IF YOU WANTED TO WAIT
IN THE CAR.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.114
OH, RIGHT.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.886
GOT IT.

35:21.150 --> 35:23.352
I AM SORRY, THOUGH,

35:23.352 --> 35:26.625
FOR AMBER KLEIN'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.227
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

35:28.227 --> 35:29.828
THE PARTY WAS REALLY LAME.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.200
( laughs )

35:31.200 --> 35:34.633
AMBER KLEIN IS LAME,
SO THAT'S NOT A SHOCKER.

35:36.305 --> 35:38.807
DO YOU THINK
DANNY WAS RIGHT?

35:38.807 --> 35:40.639
WHAT?
THAT WE BAILED ON EACH OTHER?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.613
I DON'T KNOW.

35:44.613 --> 35:47.246
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH--

35:47.246 --> 35:49.518
IT WAS--

35:49.518 --> 35:51.880
IT WOULD HAVE PUT A STRAIN
ON ANY FRIENDSHIP.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.183
YEAH.

35:54.183 --> 35:56.185
AND MAYBE
IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY--

35:56.185 --> 35:58.557
US DRIFTING APART.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.889
NOT ALL FRIENDSHIPS
LAST FOREVER.

36:03.262 --> 36:06.895
WE SHOULD GO IN,
SEE IF THAT SECURITY GUARD
HAS SEEN HIM.

36:06.895 --> 36:08.767
HE MAY CALL THE COPS ON US.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.840
I KNOW.
WE HAVE TO RISK IT.

36:23.252 --> 36:25.754
MAYBE HE HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

36:25.754 --> 36:28.317
- DO YOU THINK DANNY--
- GOT TO THE APARTMENT?

36:28.317 --> 36:31.260
- I DON'T KNOW.
- MAYBE HE FOUND
WHOEVER LIVES THERE.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.522
WHY HAS HE BEEN GONE
FOR SO LONG?

36:33.522 --> 36:36.194
LET ME TEXT HIM AGAIN.

36:44.573 --> 36:47.236
- ( typing )
- HE'S NOT ANSWERING ME.

36:47.236 --> 36:49.938
JO, COME ON.
HE MIGHT COME BACK.

36:49.938 --> 36:51.540
I FOUND
A BUILDING DIRECTORY.

37:05.694 --> 37:07.696
OH MY GOD.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.871
YES, I ENTERED.
BUT TECHNICALLY I DIDN'T BREAK.

37:22.871 --> 37:25.774
THE DOOR WAS WEDGED OPEN
WITH ONE OF THOSE, UM--

37:25.774 --> 37:28.917
- THE WEDGY THINGS,
LIKE, ON THE DOORS.
- I'M SORRY,

37:28.917 --> 37:33.652
BUT I'M REQUIRED TO REPORT
ALL UNAUTHORIZED ENTRANCE
TO THE COPS.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.254
SIR, UH...

37:36.254 --> 37:38.927
COME ON,
I JUST EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

37:38.927 --> 37:40.459
NOT WELL.

37:40.459 --> 37:43.532
I TOLD YOU THAT THE ENVELOPE,

37:43.532 --> 37:45.894
IT HAD A RETURN ADDRESS
ON IT, SO I WAS--

37:45.894 --> 37:47.536
DO YOU THINK I'M DUMB?

37:47.536 --> 37:49.938
NO ONE'S LIVED
IN 413 FOR A WHILE.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.541
THE LAST GUY DIED
MONTHS AGO AND THEY
STILL HAVEN'T FILLED IT.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.548
HEY, BARRY, HOW'S IT GOING?

37:59.548 --> 38:02.581
YEAH, I GOT A KID HERE--
B AND E.

38:02.581 --> 38:05.514
YOU MIND SWINGING BY?

38:05.514 --> 38:08.587
YEAH.
NO DAMAGE.

38:10.419 --> 38:11.790
IT'S IN THE REPORT.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.563
YEAH, OF COURSE.

38:17.466 --> 38:19.968
HE'S HERE WITH ME NOW.

38:23.332 --> 38:26.335
- I'LL TALK TO YOU.
- Lacey: IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

38:26.335 --> 38:29.408
- IT SEEMS PRETTY POSSIBLE.
THAT LIST--
- IS WRONG.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.680
HOW COULD VIKRAM
HAVE SENT THAT CASH AND NOTE?
HE'S DEAD.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.582
THEY NEVER FOUND A BODY.

38:33.582 --> 38:36.785
( laughs )
THIS IS SO MESSED UP.

38:36.785 --> 38:38.046
YEAH, I KNOW.

38:38.046 --> 38:39.888
DID REGINA KNOW VIKRAM?

38:39.888 --> 38:43.452
NO.
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SHE DID.

38:43.452 --> 38:45.524
HOW DO YOU THINK DANNY
WOULD REACT TO THIS?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.095
HE WAS SO CLOSE TO HIS DAD.

38:47.095 --> 38:49.598
( phone vibrating )

38:51.800 --> 38:54.663
IT'S DANNY.
HE'S BEEN BUSTED BY SECURITY.
THEY'RE CALLING THE COPS.

38:56.565 --> 38:59.438
( knocking )

39:00.609 --> 39:01.910
COME ON IN.

39:03.612 --> 39:05.944
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

39:05.944 --> 39:08.677
GROSS.
I'M NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN.

39:08.677 --> 39:11.720
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.623
OKAY, MAYBE I WILL.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.427
LISTEN, I, UH--

39:18.427 --> 39:19.928
I KNOW, TESS.

39:19.928 --> 39:23.061
IT'S-- IT'S OKAY.
I OVERREACTED.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.695
YOU KNOW?
IT HIT A NERVE.

39:26.695 --> 39:28.837
VIKRAM AND I--

39:28.837 --> 39:32.401
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY WE DIDN'T
HAVE THE PERFECT MARRIAGE.

39:32.401 --> 39:35.744
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DON'T MISS HIM.

39:35.744 --> 39:37.746
YEAH.

39:37.746 --> 39:39.578
I BET YOU DO TOO.

39:41.550 --> 39:44.583
HE WAS ONE OF A KIND.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.984
DEFINITELY.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.086
AND DANNY WORSHIPPED HIM.

39:48.086 --> 39:52.891
KAREN, HAVE YOU FOCUSED
ON ANYTHING BUT DANNY
SINCE HE GOT BACK?

39:52.891 --> 39:54.523
LIKE WHAT?

39:54.523 --> 39:57.426
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO,

39:57.426 --> 40:00.098
I DON'T HAVE
ANY REAL HOBBIES,

40:00.098 --> 40:02.431
AND I HAVEN'T HAD A JOB
IN YEARS.

40:02.431 --> 40:04.573
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU GET ONE.

40:04.573 --> 40:08.477
A HOBBY,
OR EVEN A JOB.

40:10.809 --> 40:14.813
SO, WANT TO FINISH
MAKING YOUR VASE?

40:14.813 --> 40:17.816
SURE.
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

40:17.816 --> 40:21.950
IT'S, UH--
IT'S INTERESTING.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.622
IT SUCKS, DOESN'T IT?

40:23.622 --> 40:25.894
IT'S NOT GREAT.

40:25.894 --> 40:29.958
SO DID YOU ALWAYS KNOW
YOU WANTED TO BE

40:29.958 --> 40:33.932
A SECURITY GUARD
IN AN APARTMENT
IN CONNECTICUT OR--

40:33.932 --> 40:36.565
( footsteps approach )

40:36.565 --> 40:39.808
- THERE YOU ARE.
- WE WERE SO WORRIED.

40:39.808 --> 40:41.640
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU--
- SIR, WE'RE SORRY.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.942
WE CAN EXPLAIN.

40:45.874 --> 40:48.647
REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID WE GOT
A LETTER FROM APARTMENT 413?

40:49.678 --> 40:52.120
THAT WAS A LIE
TO GET IN THE BUILDING.

40:52.120 --> 40:56.655
OUR FRIEND, HE'S IN LOVE
WITH A WOMAN THAT LIVES HERE.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.587
- ANGELA PECK. DO YOU KNOW HER?
- ANGELA PECK?

40:58.587 --> 41:01.189
SHE LIVES IN 431,
NOT 413.

41:01.189 --> 41:02.891
- OH!
- 431!

41:02.891 --> 41:05.033
YOU GOT THE APARTMENT WRONG.

41:05.033 --> 41:07.736
SHOOT, I INVERTED
THE NUMBERS AGAIN.

41:07.736 --> 41:09.998
- HE ALWAYS DOES THAT.
- YOU LOVE-SICK MORON.

41:09.998 --> 41:11.900
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ANY OF THIS?

41:11.900 --> 41:16.605
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS EMBARRASSED.

41:16.605 --> 41:19.548
A-- ANGELA, YOU KNOW,

41:19.548 --> 41:21.980
WON'T SEE ME.
SHE WON'T TAKE MY CALLS.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.913
- SHE WON'T EVEN TELL ME WHY.
- PROBABLY BECAUSE
SHE'S MARRIED.

41:26.154 --> 41:29.688
I KNOW.
BUT HER HUSBAND, YOU KNOW?

41:29.688 --> 41:31.720
HE DOESN'T GET HER LIKE I DO.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.593
WEREN'T YOU EVER
A TEEN WITH A CRUSH?

41:34.593 --> 41:37.065
SURE, BUT NOT ON A WOMAN
WITH FOUR KIDS.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.071
OKAY, I'M GONNA CALL
MRS. PECK TO CONFIRM ALL THIS.

41:43.071 --> 41:45.604
IT'S LATE.
WON'T SHE BE ASLEEP?

41:45.604 --> 41:47.075
AND HER KIDS.

41:50.879 --> 41:52.681
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

41:54.082 --> 41:56.284
AND LEAVE POOR ANGELA
AND HER FAMILY ALONE.

42:14.903 --> 42:19.207
( door opens, closes )

42:19.207 --> 42:20.969
AHEM.

42:22.571 --> 42:25.874
I DO WANT
TO PROTECT JO,

42:25.874 --> 42:29.547
EVEN IF WHAT I TELL YOU
ENDS UP HURTING HER.

42:31.650 --> 42:34.723
OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

42:34.723 --> 42:36.685
( sighs )

42:36.685 --> 42:39.187
UM, THE NIGHT OF FALL FEST,

42:39.187 --> 42:42.160
I WALKED HOME
THROUGH McNALLY PARK

42:42.160 --> 42:45.864
AND I SAW SOMETHING ODD.

42:45.864 --> 42:49.567
UM, IT WAS DANNY'S MOM.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.641
SHE LOOKED SO SAD
AND CONFUSED.

42:52.641 --> 42:56.144
AND THEN I SAW HER
THROW SOMETHING INTO THE WATER.

42:56.144 --> 42:58.677
NOW IT WAS DARK
AND I COULDN'T SEE VERY WELL,

42:58.677 --> 43:01.610
BUT THIS THING--
IT GLINTED AS IT FELL.

43:01.610 --> 43:05.053
AND I THINK IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A NECKLACE.

43:09.057 --> 43:12.120
SO HE SAID THAT GUY
IN THE APARTMENT HAS BEEN DEAD
FOR MONTHS?

43:12.120 --> 43:13.591
APPARENTLY.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.764
THE APARTMENT
WAS JUST SITTING THERE VACANT.

43:15.764 --> 43:17.125
IT'S WEIRD, HUH?

43:17.125 --> 43:19.227
YEAH.

43:19.227 --> 43:21.069
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

43:21.069 --> 43:22.901
WHO COULD HAVE SENT
THAT LETTER TO REGINA

43:22.901 --> 43:25.734
FROM AN ADDRESS
THAT NO ONE LIVES?

43:25.734 --> 43:27.776
I HAVE NO IDEA.

43:29.778 --> 43:33.381
( laughs )
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST
WENT BACK TO JUVIE TONIGHT.

43:33.381 --> 43:35.013
FOR WHAT?
FOR NOTHING.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.646
WE DIDN'T FIGURE OUT
ONE FRIGGIN' THING.

43:37.646 --> 43:38.787
I KNOW.

43:38.787 --> 43:41.750
TOTALLY SUCKS.

43:41.750 --> 43:44.693
( slow music playing )
