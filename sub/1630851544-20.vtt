00:01.653 --> 00:03.438
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...Mama Pina, these here are

00:03.481 --> 00:05.353
Officers Dominique Luca and... Chris Alonso.

00:05.396 --> 00:09.444
<i>I open my home
to undocumented women escaping</i>

00:09.487 --> 00:10.793
bad situations.

00:10.836 --> 00:11.924
<i>I know it's really hard for you</i>

00:11.968 --> 00:13.361
<i>to trust someone in uniform.</i>

00:13.404 --> 00:15.667
My, uh, cell phone
number's on the back.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.713
You need any help in the
future, I'm your first call.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.236
Really is beautiful here.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.411
Good place to clear your head.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.717
And what were you thinking about

00:21.760 --> 00:23.153
as you stared off
into the Atlantic?

00:23.197 --> 00:24.633
Us.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.069
<i>Come on, we talked about this.</i>

00:26.113 --> 00:27.592
<i>But nothing ever changes.</i>

00:27.636 --> 00:29.507
Is anyone waiting for you
to come home safe tonight?

00:29.551 --> 00:30.682
There is,

00:30.726 --> 00:32.597
<i>but it's complicated.</i>

00:32.641 --> 00:35.426
It seems like the least I
could do is buy you a bite.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.863
<i>Any way you could give me</i> <i>
a ride home?</i>

00:41.954 --> 00:43.565
<i>I was thinking</i> <i>
first we hit up Sikumen,</i>

00:43.608 --> 00:47.308
grab some dim sum. Then we move
on to Delalo's for cocktails.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.571
Then, if things are going good,

00:49.614 --> 00:51.486
we roll back to ours
for some coffee.

00:51.529 --> 00:52.487
Wait, what are you
talking about?

00:52.530 --> 00:53.488
Double date night.

00:53.531 --> 00:54.663
Don't tell me you forgot.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.099
I've reminded you twice.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.709
- That's tonight?
- Yes.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.102
It's my third date with Olivia.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.321
But I can't stand
seeing you moping

01:00.364 --> 01:02.236
on your lonesome
any longer, so...

01:02.279 --> 01:03.846
Olivia's bringing
her friend Darcy.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.543
- You're gonna love her.
- I don't know, man.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.589
I-I was thinking of having
an early night tonight.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.678
What's with you, man?
You're turning into a monk.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.288
No, I'm not. I went
on a date last week.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.290
Yeah, and you were
home in bed by 9:30

01:13.334 --> 01:15.249
with a cup of chamomile
tea for company.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.685
She was a flight attendant.
She had an early start

01:16.728 --> 01:17.860
- in the morning.
- And you haven't made

01:17.903 --> 01:19.340
any plans to see her again.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.298
I didn't think
- she was that into me.
- Look,

01:21.342 --> 01:22.995
it's a numbers game, dude.
But you have to be in the game

01:23.039 --> 01:24.171
to play the game.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.259
Come out tonight, meet Darcy.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.564
I've been talking you up.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.131
I'm just not really feeling it.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.873
Look, I can't bring
Olivia back to our place

01:30.916 --> 01:32.179
if you're gonna be
sitting on the couch

01:32.222 --> 01:33.093
watching one of
your baking shows.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.007
It's a real mood killer.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.272
8:00 tonight. And you
can thank me in the morning.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.191
Hondo.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.583
Hey. What's up?

01:45.627 --> 01:46.541
Just had a call.
Mama Pina's in the hospital.

01:46.584 --> 01:47.672
She okay?

01:47.716 --> 01:49.152
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.153
- She wants to see me.
- All right, then go.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.241
- Go.
- You sure?

01:51.285 --> 01:52.895
Yeah.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.505
I'll get one of the new SWAT
officers to fill in for you,

01:54.549 --> 01:55.854
and I'll square it
away with Hicks.

01:55.898 --> 01:56.681
Thanks.

01:56.725 --> 01:57.813
No worries.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.162
Send Mama Pina our best.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.642
- I will.
- All right.

02:14.917 --> 02:15.961
You coming?

02:25.928 --> 02:27.364
Jackpot.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.540
Pizza and beer.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.107
Breakfast of champions.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.761
We should go.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.980
Don't get your panties
in a twist.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.157
I just want to take
a quick look around.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.337
Hell yeah, man.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.166
Oh, these things are
worth, like, hundreds.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.778
Look around. See what
other toys you can find.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.736
Hoo-hoo.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.390
Dude, what are you doing?

02:53.434 --> 02:54.565
Don't just stand there.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.265
Oh.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.225
You think this thing's legit?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.140
Ho-ho-ho.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.141
Feels nice.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.229
Take my picture.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.752
I'm like Daughter of Rambo.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.928
I don't think you
should be doing that.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.713
Ooh!

03:11.756 --> 03:12.757
- Oh!
- Just-just put it down.

03:12.801 --> 03:13.845
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.369
That's right.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.675
Oh...

03:17.719 --> 03:18.807
my God.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.723
You think
this thing's loaded, too?

03:26.771 --> 03:28.251
Oh-ho-ho!

03:28.295 --> 03:29.252
We-we got to get out of here!

03:32.037 --> 03:32.951
Okay. Yeah.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.651
What are you doing?!

03:40.220 --> 03:42.396
This is 1-Adam-10! Shots fired!

03:42.439 --> 03:43.919
Request immediate backup!

03:49.141 --> 03:50.969
I can't believe it.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.928
I made it.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.799
I'm LAPD SWAT.Best of the best.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.497
Congratulations.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.238
HICKS:Cabrera.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.457
Commander, I just want

04:00.501 --> 04:01.719
to say thank you for the honor.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.330
I won't let you down. I promise.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.027
Well, that's why
you were chosen.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.420
- We're counting on you.
- Do you mind

04:06.463 --> 04:08.160
if I ask what team
I'll be assigned to?

04:08.204 --> 04:09.205
There's still
some algebra to be done

04:09.249 --> 04:10.859
before we make
that decision.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.164
But, for today,
you're gonna be joining Tan

04:12.208 --> 04:13.253
and the rest
of 20-Squad.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.603
- For real?
- Yeah. For real.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.561
Hondo's a man down,
so you're up.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.084
Hondo just buzzed me.
We're rolling out.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.304
Better get moving.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.566
Uh, yes, sir.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.568
- Thank you, sir.
- Go.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.457
<i>You saw the suspects</i>

04:43.500 --> 04:45.154
- breaking in the house?
- Yeah. Two kids.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.329
They're from the group home
a couple streets over.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.330
Kids?

04:47.374 --> 04:48.331
How young are we talkin'?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.463
15, 16, maybe?

04:49.506 --> 04:51.378
Girl's always
causing trouble.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.814
Vandalized my neighbor's
yard last week,

04:52.857 --> 04:54.381
smashed up her lawn chairs.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.470
Cops came, gave her
a slap on the wrist.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.341
Is there anyone else
- in the house?
Not that we know.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.951
DMV says the homeowner's
got a red pickup.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.126
There's no sign of it.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.084
All right, get her
someplace safe.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.128
- Go. Move.
- Copy.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.956
Hey.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.828
Property records show the place
is owned by Sergio Molina.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.352
No priors. Got a permit
for a single handgun.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.226
That's definitely not a handgun.
Get to the Gurkha.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.968
Unis evacuated every house
in a two-block radius.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.274
20-Squad, post up.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.239
This is Sergeant Harrelson. LAPD.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.893
I need you to put that gun down

05:28.937 --> 05:30.417
and come out with your hands
in the air.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.202
And I need you
to come a little closer.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.422
Tan, Street, find a way around
the back.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.640
I'll distract them. Roger.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.862
Talk to me. Let's work this out.

05:40.905 --> 05:41.950
Nobody needs
to get hurt today.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.299
Listen to what he's saying.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.474
Go see if there
are more bullets.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.309
I got movement
at the front door.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.485
- It's opening.
- Stay alert.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.401
It's the boy. He's unarmed.

05:58.445 --> 05:59.663
Hands up! In the air!

06:02.971 --> 06:04.320
Chicken!

06:04.364 --> 06:06.714
Keep coming.
Come on, keep going.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.716
Keep your hands up.
Anyone else in the house

06:08.759 --> 06:10.282
- besides you two?
- No, it's just us.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.415
I have a visual
and a piece of the suspect.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.030
She's just a kid.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.032
With a lethal weapon
in her hands, Cabrera.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.428
Street, Tan, what's your status?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.474
In position on the three side.20-David,
you're clear for entry.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.606
Making entry now.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.437
Cabrera,
you're their cover.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.442
You ever heard of Teena Marie?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.923
The singer
back in the '80s,

06:41.966 --> 06:43.446
way before you were born.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.231
My mom used to play her record
all the time.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.016
That's why I know
all the lyrics.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.931
You want
to hear them?

06:49.974 --> 06:52.063
- LAPD! Don't move!
- No!

06:52.107 --> 06:53.717
Give me your hands.
26-David.

06:53.761 --> 06:54.849
Suspect
in custody.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.329
Checking the rest
of the house.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.472
Oh, man.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.519
What was that
Teena Marie song?

07:12.562 --> 07:15.260
"Don't Look Back."I used to love that tune.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.444
Hondo, you need to see this.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.838
Homeowner's either stocking up

07:27.882 --> 07:29.971
for end of days, or he's
an illegal arms dealer.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.886
Looks like he's also in
the ghost gun business.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.278
He's making
drop-in auto-sears.

07:33.322 --> 07:36.543
He's turning these ARs
into fully automatics.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.505
Hondo, look.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.985
Empty.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.378
Looks like he might've
just done a deal.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.296
Judging by all this cash,

07:51.340 --> 07:52.602
a pretty damn big one.

07:52.646 --> 07:53.690
But with who?

07:55.823 --> 07:56.911
And why?

08:36.472 --> 08:38.169
If those kids hadn't
broken into this house,

08:38.213 --> 08:39.780
might never have known
a gunrunner was sitting pretty

08:39.823 --> 08:41.172
in the middle
of Toluca Park.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.044
Imagine if that kid
had found them.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.307
We'd be sitting pretty in the
middle of <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

08:45.350 --> 08:46.569
Hey, Hondo said
the homeowner,

08:46.613 --> 08:48.484
Molina, drives
a red pickup, right?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.009
That's got to be him.
That's Molina!

08:52.053 --> 08:54.142
- Don't let him get by!
- On it. I'll cut him off at the corner.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.725
Hey! Stop!
On your knees!

09:11.768 --> 09:13.553
Hands in the air, now!

09:13.596 --> 09:15.380
- LAPD! Don't move!
- On the ground. Hands behind your head!

09:15.424 --> 09:17.426
Give me your hands.

09:19.776 --> 09:23.040
Those are for personal use.
Pest control. Right.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.434
Shooting squirrels
with a 50 cal, are you?

09:25.477 --> 09:27.523
Yeah, yeah. Pellet gun's got
nothing against those critters.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.178
You can only get them
one at a time.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.092
Cut the crap.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.484
You're dealing illegal weapons,

09:32.528 --> 09:34.051
and you're making
automatic rifles with the help

09:34.095 --> 09:35.705
of that 3-D printer.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.664
Exact type of gun that
was used in a mass shooting

09:37.707 --> 09:39.274
in Sacramento last year.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.580
And an ambush on
law enforcement officers

09:40.623 --> 09:42.233
in Bakersfield a few weeks ago.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.670
They found one of the guns
at the scene.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.497
I'm sure it won't take much
to link it back to you.

09:45.541 --> 09:48.022
All they got to do is match up
the plastic auto-sear

09:48.065 --> 09:51.112
to your printer, and you're
looking at an accessory

09:51.155 --> 09:53.027
to attempted murder charge,
on police officers, too.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.376
That's a capital felony.

09:54.419 --> 09:55.638
Add that to an
illegal weapons charge,

09:55.682 --> 09:57.205
how long you think
he'll get, Luca?

09:57.248 --> 09:58.423
I'm guessing that
they'll be carrying him out

09:58.467 --> 09:59.860
of prison in a cheap pine box.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.210
Looks like you made
some bank recently, hmm?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.168
$60,000
to be precise.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.301
Found it in a duffel
in your gun room.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.520
Hey. Start talking.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.522
Tell us what you sold
and to who,

10:10.566 --> 10:12.002
and then maybe you
won't be leaving prison

10:12.046 --> 10:13.787
in a pine box after all.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.093
Okay. Okay. Okay, s...

10:16.137 --> 10:18.400
say I did sell something--

10:18.443 --> 10:20.794
hypothetically speaking,
that is--

10:20.837 --> 10:22.926
and the buyer paid
a premium to expedite

10:22.970 --> 10:25.712
the goods because they
needed them for something big,

10:25.755 --> 10:27.409
something going down today.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.629
- What kind of big?
- Big. Big.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.588
But that's all I know.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.589
What goods are we
talking about exactly?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.982
Hypothetically,

10:35.025 --> 10:36.505
uh, we're talking
maybe six of those ARs,

10:36.548 --> 10:37.811
converted to full auto.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.944
50 Cal. A thousand
rounds of ammo,

10:40.988 --> 10:43.077
give or take.
A handful of grenades.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.341
You got a hypothetical
name for me?
No.

10:46.384 --> 10:49.300
But get me a deal

10:49.344 --> 10:52.564
signed by the D.A.,
granting me full immunity,

10:52.608 --> 10:56.264
and I will give you a full
detailed description of him

10:56.307 --> 10:57.874
and his pickup.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.050
Let's roll, Luca.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.748
- Officer.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

11:01.791 --> 11:03.140
What about,
what about my deal?

11:03.184 --> 11:04.533
- You-you need me.
- Not anymore,

11:04.576 --> 11:06.622
we don't.
You just gave us a lead.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.015
And...

11:08.058 --> 11:10.800
we got this.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.280
Come on, man.
Hot Don's?

11:12.323 --> 11:15.326
It's pretty bad coffee,
if I recall. Stale donuts, too.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.634
I also remember it sits opposite
the Son of a Gun shooting range.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
And judging from the number of
cups in this hoarder's paradise

11:20.723 --> 11:23.291
you call a truck, you spend
a lot of time at that range.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.945
Yeah, it's likely
where you do your business.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.250
If we grab a warrant
for their security tapes,

11:26.294 --> 11:27.425
I don't think
it's gonna be that hard

11:27.469 --> 11:28.426
to find out who bought
the weapons.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.081
Get him out of here.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.040
We got to find out
who that buyer is.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.128
We don't have
much time.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.528
Hey. How you doing?

11:43.572 --> 11:45.835
Uh, good. Yeah. Great.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.493
Talk to me.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.628
Ten years under my belt
as a cop,

11:56.672 --> 11:59.762
and I've only had to draw
my weapon twice,

11:59.806 --> 12:02.896
and I've never once had to
fire it in the line of duty.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.593
Two minutes
into my first

12:04.636 --> 12:06.377
SWAT assignment, and I got

12:06.421 --> 12:09.163
a teenager in my sights,
and my finger on the trigger.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.599
I knew being on SWAT
would mean

12:10.642 --> 12:12.427
facing these kinds
of situations,

12:12.470 --> 12:14.646
but shooting paper targets

12:14.690 --> 12:17.475
and shooting kids are two
very different things.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.521
Yeah, today was a...

12:19.564 --> 12:22.263
tough first callout,
that's for sure.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.569
But no one got hurt.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.049
No one died,
thank God.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.703
But they could've,

12:27.747 --> 12:30.140
that's the thing.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.707
I know I would've
pulled the trigger

12:31.751 --> 12:33.535
if Hondo had given me
the green light.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.711
I guess I'm
just wondering

12:35.755 --> 12:39.280
how I'd be feeling
right now if he had.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.372
How do you deal with that?

12:46.026 --> 12:48.811
My faith.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.813
Spend a lot of time
in confession.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.815
Every day,
I wake up,

12:52.859 --> 12:55.165
and I pray that I
won't have to take a life.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.298
Most days, those prayers
are answered.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.516
And when they're not?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.825
Nothing I say
could truly prepare you,

13:02.869 --> 13:05.828
but just know this:

13:05.872 --> 13:08.962
every time I've
had to take a life,

13:09.005 --> 13:11.094
it was the only option.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.574
I did what I had to do,

13:12.617 --> 13:14.489
and it saved the lives
of civilians

13:14.532 --> 13:15.751
or the lives
of my team.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.580
And if that
moment comes,

13:18.623 --> 13:19.886
you can trust that you'll
make the right decision

13:19.929 --> 13:21.409
because you've trained to.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.368
Doesn't necessarily make
the weight of it go away,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.196
but it helps.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.025
It helps knowing that you did
the only thing you could do.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.769
The harder part?

13:33.813 --> 13:36.859
Reconciling it
with my conscience.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.643
And with God.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.342
I hear you.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.572
You working through
the security tapes

13:54.616 --> 13:56.139
from the gun range?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.098
Yeah. It's definitely the place
Molina does business.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.230
His truck's parked out there
almost every day,

14:00.274 --> 14:01.971
but the books show
he isn't going in to shoot.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.191
I caught him doing
some small-time deals,

14:04.234 --> 14:05.932
but nothing big
and no sign of the truck.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.585
- You want some help?
- Yeah, sure.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.631
Olivia sent
over Darcy's

14:09.674 --> 14:11.633
social media links,
- by the way.
- Who?

14:11.676 --> 14:14.810
Darcy. Your date tonight.
What is with you, man?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.247
Anyway, I did
a deep dive on her.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.988
You guys are a match
made in heaven.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.076
Oh, yeah?
How you figure that?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.077
Check out her posts.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.819
♪GymBunny.
#BikeLife.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.083
♪OpenRoad.
And, extra bonus,

14:27.127 --> 14:29.216
she loves English
baking shows.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.044
Look, what's
the matter with you?

14:31.087 --> 14:33.481
I've seen criminals
more excited to do a lineup.

14:33.524 --> 14:34.525
Are you nervous?
Is that it?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.440
Why would I be nervous?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.181
'Cause your dating skills
are, like, super rusty.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.748
Look, man, I get it.
You're scared

14:39.791 --> 14:41.054
you lost your touch,
but trust me,

14:41.097 --> 14:42.446
those moves
will come right back.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.839
I'll be your wingman,

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
there to catch you
if you flame out.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.450
Here we go.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.625
- That's Molina, right?
- Yeah. That's him.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.062
Looks like our buyer.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.454
Okay. Why don't you run
the plates on the truck?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.587
See if we canID him.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.070
What's the treatment plan?

14:57.113 --> 15:00.160
Stage four.
You can fight it.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.902
The doctors have done
everything they can.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.861
The only thing they can offer
now is palliative care.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.820
We can get a second opinion.
Doctors aren't always right.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.953
A friend of my cousin's
said she... It's not why I

15:10.997 --> 15:12.868
called you here, Chris.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.262
There's nothing more
they can do for me.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.003
They've tried for over a year.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
You knew about this?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.704
Why didn't you say anything?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.794
'Cause I knew everyone
would tell me to slow down,

15:25.837 --> 15:29.363
and I don't have time
to put my feet up.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.713
I have too much left to do.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.631
What do you need?
How can I help?

15:36.674 --> 15:38.981
You've done so much already,

15:39.025 --> 15:42.158
and I know SWAT
keeps you so busy.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.595
These last few months
helping out at the safe house,

15:44.639 --> 15:45.988
they've changed
my life.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.208
I'm so glad to hear that.

15:48.251 --> 15:51.124
On SWAT, every day,
we're called to emergencies.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.996
Uh, we-we-we put out the fire,
and then we go,

15:54.040 --> 15:56.912
leaving people to pick up
the pieces behind us.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.568
Volunteering with you,
helping these women,

16:00.611 --> 16:04.137
I've been able to help people
put their lives back together.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.052
It feels good.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.098
You've really made a difference.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.405
So, what can I do now?

16:13.755 --> 16:17.106
I don't expect anyone
to take over the safe house.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.631
It's too big
a responsibility,

16:20.675 --> 16:22.155
but what I need

16:22.198 --> 16:23.678
is for you
to help me

16:23.721 --> 16:25.941
find somewhere

16:25.985 --> 16:29.249
for the women in my care to go.

16:29.292 --> 16:32.426
There are shelters
I can look into.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.341
It won't be the same, but...

16:34.384 --> 16:35.385
I know,

16:35.429 --> 16:37.779
but it's the best we can do

16:37.822 --> 16:41.261
in these circumstances.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.437
Gracias, Chris.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.789
What about all the women
that are gonna need

16:47.832 --> 16:49.443
a safe place in the future?

16:49.486 --> 16:51.967
What happens to them?

16:52.011 --> 16:55.536
I don't know.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.499
What are we looking at?

17:02.543 --> 17:04.980
We ID'd the truck of the guy
Molina sold the guns to.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.460
Belongs to this guy,
Elliot Byrd.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.939
75 years old. Vietnam vet.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.332
No criminal record.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.421
Not exactly sounding
like a prime suspect.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.119
Yeah, but so far,
he's our only lead,

17:13.162 --> 17:15.382
and if it wasn't him, he might
be able to tell us who it was.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.687
We got an address?

17:16.731 --> 17:18.167
Uh, he's got an apartment
in Sun Valley,

17:18.211 --> 17:19.864
but he also owns
an appliance repair shop

17:19.908 --> 17:21.257
not too far from there.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.998
All right. Split the team
and hit up both,

17:23.042 --> 17:25.044
uh, but be careful.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.871
This guy might look like
someone's grandpa,

17:26.915 --> 17:29.178
but if he's the buyer,
he's a one-man army.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.144
Right side clear.

17:39.406 --> 17:40.494
Left side clear.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.831
He's alive.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.876
Vest stopped it.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.453
Deac, check this out.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.890
Looks like one
of Molina's guns,

18:28.933 --> 18:31.022
adapted to
fully automatic.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.547
We're lucky he didn't get
a chance to get a shot off.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.984
Damn woman shot me.
You should arrest her.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.507
Get away from me.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.640
We got it.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.686
So, where are you hiding
the rest of the guns?

18:42.730 --> 18:44.253
What are you planning
on using them for?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.777
Well, now, even if I told you,

18:46.821 --> 18:49.824
it'd be too late for you
to do anything about it.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.435
You ain't catching them.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.176
You people.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.700
You couldn't catch a cold
if you stood naked in the snow.

18:56.744 --> 18:57.832
Who's them?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.226
What are
the targets?

19:00.269 --> 19:01.836
My ass.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.755
I ain't telling you squat.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.845
I was in 'Nam.
Fought for my country.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.803
Flag bomb killed
three of my unit.

19:12.847 --> 19:16.503
You think we cooperated
with the enemy?

19:16.546 --> 19:18.766
I am not a traitor.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.594
You are the traitors.

19:20.637 --> 19:24.206
Stooges for
a corrupt government.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.294
Found this.

19:27.253 --> 19:30.647
Guy has zero personal effects,
except for this one photo.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.347
Who's this?

19:34.390 --> 19:35.783
Is this your son?

19:36.958 --> 19:38.177
Hmm.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.658
Well, I guess
we're done here.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.053
Cabrera,

19:45.096 --> 19:47.708
you want to do
the honors?

19:47.751 --> 19:49.579
Get him
out of here.

19:54.105 --> 19:57.108
I just got a hit
through facial recognition.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.460
The younger guy in the photo
is Elliot's nephew, Tom Byrd.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.071
SWAT arrested him
a few years back.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.638
Pulled off eight
armed robberies.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.030
Targeted high-end
jewelry stores

20:06.074 --> 20:07.728
in Beverly Hills
and Brentwood.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.469
That's right. Didn't he kill
a security guard?

20:09.512 --> 20:11.253
I thought he was given
- a life sentence.
- He was.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.603
He got out. Paperwork error
in the D.A.'s office.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.780
I just sent Luca Tom Byrd's
mugshot. He thinks Byrd's

20:16.824 --> 20:19.392
the man in the video doing
the weapons deal with Molina,

20:19.435 --> 20:20.741
so he must'veborrowed

20:20.784 --> 20:22.482
his uncle's truck
to pick him up.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.092
Maybe he's got a crew together,
planning another robbery.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.485
You don't need grenades
and automatic weapons

20:25.528 --> 20:27.269
to smash-and-grab
a jewelry store.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.444
What if he's not planning
another robbery?

20:28.488 --> 20:30.054
The way his uncle was talking,

20:30.098 --> 20:31.404
he had a lot of anger
towards the government.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.276
Words like "traitor"
and "stooge."

20:34.320 --> 20:36.104
What if Tom shares
his uncle's views?

20:36.147 --> 20:37.758
We can check with the FBI.
See if either of them

20:37.801 --> 20:40.282
have been flagged for anything
domestic terror-related.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.023
Well, we already got
a BOLO out on Tom Byrd.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.112
There's no address or
phone number on file for him,

20:44.155 --> 20:45.766
so tracking him's
gonna be tough.

20:45.809 --> 20:46.984
What if we throw
a geofence warrant

20:47.028 --> 20:48.551
around the appliance store?

20:48.595 --> 20:49.639
That should get us
the phone numbers of anybody

20:49.683 --> 20:50.771
that's been hanging out there.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.207
Might get us Tom Byrd's number.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.556
We could trace that,
get a lock on him.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.602
All right.
That's a good idea.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.300
I'll fast-track a warrant,
and I'll get on with the FBI.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.656
Hey, there you are.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.790
You, uh, you saved
my life earlier. Thank you.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.313
Training kicked in,
just like you said it would.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.836
How you feeling
about it now?

21:12.880 --> 21:15.274
Like I passed a test,
you know?

21:15.317 --> 21:16.710
I didn't freeze in the moment.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.625
I mean, I'm glad
he was wearing that vest.

21:18.668 --> 21:21.236
Yeah. You know, you might want
to hit the gym,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.846
work off some
of that adrenaline,

21:22.890 --> 21:24.283
otherwise you'll-you'll
crash later.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.285
I'm good. I'm fine.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
Can't wait to get back
out there.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.989
FBI just sent over intel
on our suspect, Tom Byrd.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.383
He recently came across
their radar.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.559
He was flagged for expressing
extreme views online.

21:39.602 --> 21:42.388
What kind of extreme views
are we talking about?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.781
Well, apparently, Byrd
was calling for the secession

21:44.825 --> 21:46.566
of the eastern part
of California

21:46.609 --> 21:48.829
from the West Coast elites.
Urging people to rise up

21:48.872 --> 21:50.047
with deadly force

21:50.091 --> 21:51.745
against politicians,
the police,

21:51.788 --> 21:54.400
saying they were traitors
who needed to be executed.

21:54.443 --> 21:55.879
Well, Tan did some digging
into their background.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.359
The Byrds had a farm
near Fresno.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.492
Now, Tom's father,
Elliot's brother,

21:59.535 --> 22:01.494
killed himself a couple years
back when the farm went under.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.365
Blamed it on state regulations
and high taxes.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.063
During his robbery trial,
Tom claimed he only carried out

22:06.107 --> 22:07.978
the jewelry heists
to save the family farm.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.632
Bank went and foreclosed on it
while he was in jail.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.199
So, we got
ourselves a motive,

22:11.242 --> 22:12.896
we just don't
- know their targets.
- Yeah.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.028
Likely, it's someone
or something

22:14.071 --> 22:15.464
connected to
the government.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.770
Tan, let's comb through
Byrd's social media,

22:16.813 --> 22:17.945
see if anyone there
could be a lead.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.468
We know Tom Byrd
did not act alone.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.991
Yeah, I'm already
working through it.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.253
There's a lot of people
on there, though.

22:22.297 --> 22:23.211
Hating on the government,police--

22:23.254 --> 22:24.473
pretty popular cause.

22:24.517 --> 22:25.953
We got to get moving.
If Molina's right

22:25.996 --> 22:27.824
about this attack
going down today,

22:27.868 --> 22:29.391
we're running out of time.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.656
Geofence warrant
finally came back.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.442
Same six cell phones kept
pinging at the appliance store,

22:36.485 --> 22:38.008
despite the fact
Deac said it looked like

22:38.052 --> 22:39.880
it hadn't seen a customer
since 1987.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.490
Okay. Who are the phones
registered to?

22:41.534 --> 22:43.362
They're all burners, so no idea.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.407
We can ping them. Find out where
- they are right now.
- Yeah,

22:45.451 --> 22:47.540
that's what I'm doing.
Just take me a few minutes

22:47.583 --> 22:48.976
to triangulate
them all.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.281
So, you ready for your
big date tonight?

22:51.979 --> 22:53.459
You know about that, huh?

22:53.502 --> 22:54.808
Yeah, Luca told me.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.636
Showed me her profile.
Seems pretty great.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.420
They're even compatible
- horoscope-wise.
- Mm.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.682
That's meaningless.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.118
- You know that, right?
- No, it isn't.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.990
I never date Scorpios,
sting in their tail.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.426
Hey, I'm just glad

23:04.470 --> 23:06.689
you're getting back out there.
It's about time.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.735
How's your research going
on the social media page?

23:08.778 --> 23:10.780
Oh, it's mainly a forum
to complain

23:10.824 --> 23:12.347
about gas prices
and property rights.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.305
Lots of talk
of a new California,

23:14.349 --> 23:15.785
but it's hard to tell
how much is bluster,

23:15.829 --> 23:18.266
- how much is for real.
- A new California?

23:18.309 --> 23:19.615
Yeah, they want
to carve out a new state.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.487
As far as I can tell,
this utopia

23:21.530 --> 23:24.228
will have no taxes,
no regulation, free gas

23:24.272 --> 23:25.621
and no cops.
So, let me guess,

23:25.665 --> 23:27.884
just a volunteer militia
to keep the peace?

23:27.928 --> 23:29.582
And we already know they have
all the weapons they need.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.192
Okay. Finished triangulating
all the phones.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.889
Looks like
we got something.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.283
<i>All six burner phones</i>

23:35.326 --> 23:36.763
linked to the appliance store
just pinged

23:36.806 --> 23:38.547
to the exact same
location in Calabasas.

23:38.591 --> 23:39.766
What's this right here?

23:39.809 --> 23:41.681
It's a private,
gated community.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.465
Get on the phone with
the security company

23:43.509 --> 23:44.858
that mans the gate. Warn them
not to let anyone through.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.816
- And send units.
- On it.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.644
- We got a list of residents?
- Yeah. Pulling it up now.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.821
Mariko Almassy.
That's the same last name

23:51.865 --> 23:53.432
as the governor of California.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.651
That has to be a relative.
Yeah, I'm checking.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.305
All right,
according to Wikipedia,

23:57.348 --> 23:59.525
Mariko's the
governor's mother.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.440
Sir, the governor's
in L.A. right now.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.745
I saw a bulletin
this morning.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.181
She must be visiting
her mom.

24:04.225 --> 24:05.748
CHP handles the security

24:05.792 --> 24:07.489
for the governor.
Get on with them

24:07.533 --> 24:10.013
and warn them of a possible
imminent threat to life.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.754
Commander,

24:11.798 --> 24:13.887
says here the governor
made an off-the-cuff comment

24:13.930 --> 24:15.584
last month.
Reporter asked her

24:15.628 --> 24:16.933
what she thought about
parts of California seceding,

24:16.977 --> 24:18.674
and she laughed.
She called it absurd.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.328
That's why Byrd's
- targeting her.
- I'll grab my team

24:20.371 --> 24:21.808
and roll out. I just hope to God
we're not too late.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.331
Me, too.

24:42.393 --> 24:43.960
CHP's alerting
the governor's detail,

24:44.004 --> 24:45.745
ordering them to shelter
in place till we get there.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.573
Patrol units are still
a few minutes out.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.923
We might beat them
to the punch.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.664
Oh, rummy.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.797
Another round,
or shall I make some tea?

24:54.841 --> 24:56.059
Another round.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.496
Oh, okay.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.635
Hello?

25:23.783 --> 25:25.045
Great.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.313
What's that?

25:32.356 --> 25:34.620
Governor,
we need to move,

25:34.663 --> 25:36.796
- now.
- What-What's going on?

25:38.014 --> 25:39.189
What's happening?

25:39.233 --> 25:41.365
- What do you want?
- Take her outside.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.628
What are you doing
with my daughter?

25:42.671 --> 25:43.803
Let her go!

25:43.846 --> 25:45.587
You can come and watch
if you like.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.502
Laura!

25:49.983 --> 25:52.072
- You don't want to do this.
- Sick of people like you

25:52.115 --> 25:53.595
thinking you know what I want,

25:53.639 --> 25:55.510
that you represent the people,

25:55.554 --> 25:57.643
when you're all in the pockets
of corporations,

25:57.686 --> 25:59.775
raising taxes,
ignoring property rights.

25:59.819 --> 26:02.125
Ordinary folk are sick of it,

26:02.169 --> 26:03.866
so we're making
a stand.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.042
Forming our own state,
governed by the people,

26:06.086 --> 26:07.957
for the people,
and this

26:08.001 --> 26:10.090
is the first step

26:10.133 --> 26:12.135
in the battle
against tyranny.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.833
Please, stop.
No, what are you doing?

26:13.876 --> 26:14.877
No! Help!

26:14.921 --> 26:16.313
Stop!

26:19.055 --> 26:20.753
Take them out!

26:27.847 --> 26:29.326
Airship-5 to ground support.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.198
We are taking fire.

26:31.241 --> 26:34.070
Get us on the ground!
Now!

26:34.114 --> 26:35.637
Inside! Inside! Quick!

26:35.681 --> 26:37.378
Come on, let's go!

26:54.830 --> 26:57.311
We planned for this,
and we're gonna have

26:57.354 --> 26:58.660
the eyes of the world on us.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.227
Let's show them
we mean business.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.098
Use this as a call to arms.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.273
All right,
get busy.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.971
Fortify the place.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.625
And lucky you,

27:06.668 --> 27:08.322
you got two minutes
to say goodbye to your mom.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.891
Thanks.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.284
Byrd cut the phone line
and all the burner phones

27:14.328 --> 27:16.722
- have been switched off.
- They don't want to negotiate. They plan on killing her.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.724
We got to get in there
before it's too late.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.769
Movement. Looks like they're
fortifying the house.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.696
All right, listen up.
These guys want a confrontation.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.958
That's why they're
so heavily armed.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.003
They want to use us

27:37.046 --> 27:38.395
to put on a show,
and we're

27:38.439 --> 27:39.353
not about to turn
them into martyrs.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.659
Elliot was
a Vietnam vet.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.138
He mentioned something
about flag bombs.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.618
Yeah, that was something
the Viet Cong used.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.924
They used to booby-trap flags
to blow up

27:44.967 --> 27:46.665
when U.S. troops
captured their bases.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.057
My dad was in Vietnam.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.885
Stories he told me
gave me nightmares.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.671
Let's get in there and
save the governor. Move.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.391
30-David. In position.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.054
20-David.
In position.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.452
They're coming.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.890
Stay focused.
Let's push them back.

28:37.933 --> 28:41.458
Buy us some time
to chargrill the governor.

28:41.502 --> 28:42.982
Cans.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.207
26-David. In position.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.167
30-David. Ready for entry.

28:54.210 --> 28:57.387
On my count. Three, two, one.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.617
On your stomach.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.401
Hands.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.969
30-David.
One suspect in custody.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.452
Stay down!

29:18.495 --> 29:20.410
Stay down! Don't move!
Going hands-on.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.282
20-David.
Second suspect in custody.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.197
Go ahead.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.459
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

29:25.502 --> 29:26.721
It's booby-trapped.
Move, move, move.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.332
26-David.
Three side slider door

29:29.376 --> 29:31.117
booby-trapped.
Do not make entry.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.042
Going hands-on.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.655
30-David.
Two suspects down,

29:47.698 --> 29:49.004
one injured.
Continuing on.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.269
Anyone got eyes on the governor?

29:55.271 --> 29:57.534
Negative.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.020
Fourth suspect down!
Byrd's on the move!

30:05.064 --> 30:06.717
Find him.
Find the governor.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.417
You ready to face the music?

30:17.598 --> 30:20.819
Hold. Tan, hold.
Trip wire.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.781
Stand back!

30:26.825 --> 30:27.869
Drop that lighter.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.392
You let the hostages go.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.830
Deacon, keep him talking.
Tan, pull back.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.440
Stop!

30:33.483 --> 30:34.920
You move,
I will pull this trigger.

30:34.963 --> 30:35.790
You really want
to die today?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.226
- For the right cause?
- Sure.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.358
You think anyone will care?

30:38.401 --> 30:39.489
That it'll achieve anything?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.013
I guess
we'll find out.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.231
You won't find anything out.
You'll be dead.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.059
I'll be a hero
for the cause.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.713
I'll be in the
history books,

30:45.756 --> 30:47.106
and from now on,anyone

30:47.149 --> 30:48.498
that stands between us
and our freedom

30:48.542 --> 30:50.936
will know what happens
to traitors.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.286
Bullets are too good
for them.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.031
Move, move, move!

30:59.074 --> 31:00.423
On your stomach.
Hands behind your back.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.598
You're okay.

31:08.518 --> 31:11.652
Final suspect in custody.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.965
D.A. better not screw up
this time.

31:20.008 --> 31:22.968
Won't happen. Not with you
and me on that witness stand.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.318
Byrd's going away
for life.

31:25.361 --> 31:26.797
I guarantee it.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.679
Hey, you own deck shoes?

31:38.722 --> 31:40.855
I look like the kind of person
who owns deck shoes?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.204
Why you asking?

31:42.248 --> 31:43.902
Olivia's boss lent her
his sailboat.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.600
She's invited us
to Catalina Island

31:46.643 --> 31:48.950
for the weekend.
It's awesome, right?

31:48.994 --> 31:50.778
I got stuff to do this weekend.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.607
Like what? The finale
of a cooking show? Laundry?

31:53.650 --> 31:55.435
I think I'm gonna pass. Sorry.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.350
Okay, so let me get this
straight. You're saying no

31:57.393 --> 32:00.179
to a weekend sailing trip
with two beautiful women,

32:00.222 --> 32:01.658
to a paradise island?

32:01.702 --> 32:03.312
Is there somethinggoing on

32:03.356 --> 32:05.140
that you're not
telling me about?

32:05.184 --> 32:07.229
No, I'm just not interested
in a relationship, that's all.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.231
Who said anything
about a relationship?

32:09.275 --> 32:11.973
And, anyway, you sure
you're not looking for one?

32:12.017 --> 32:13.670
I mean,

32:13.714 --> 32:15.803
you're sure you're not
secretly falling for someone?

32:17.239 --> 32:18.458
Like Chris maybe?

32:19.459 --> 32:20.939
What?

32:20.982 --> 32:22.679
Every time her name
is mentioned,

32:22.723 --> 32:24.812
you light up like a ray
of sunshine just got spilled.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.248
There. You just did it.
Right there.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.467
- I did not.
- See? Admit it.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.947
You're into Chris.
That's why

32:28.990 --> 32:30.731
you're turning down
every other option.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.689
Look, I've known
for months.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.430
I've just been waiting for you
to come clean about it,

32:34.474 --> 32:36.650
so fess up already.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.438
Does anyone else know?

32:42.482 --> 32:44.701
I don't think so.
So, what's the deal?

32:44.745 --> 32:46.921
She's into you, too, right?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.054
I see how she looks at you.

32:49.097 --> 32:51.926
I thought she was.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.710
Then she started
blowing all cold.

32:53.754 --> 32:54.929
That's why I went
on this date

32:54.973 --> 32:56.191
with the flight attendant
last week,

32:56.235 --> 32:58.063
but even that
didn't work out

32:58.106 --> 33:01.196
because all I can think about
the whole time is Chris.

33:01.240 --> 33:05.026
Listen to me, I've dated
my fair share of women.

33:05.070 --> 33:08.029
If I found someone
as perfect for me

33:08.073 --> 33:10.292
as Chris is for you,

33:10.336 --> 33:12.555
maybe I wouldn't
still be a bachelor.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.383
You got to tell her
how you feel.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.298
Dude, it is

33:16.342 --> 33:18.344
so much more complicated
than that.

33:18.387 --> 33:19.780
Why, because you're both
on the same SWAT team?

33:19.823 --> 33:21.216
- That's one reason.
- So what, man?

33:21.260 --> 33:22.913
Just figure it out.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.828
If you don't,
you're only gonna regret it.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.134
Okay.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.488
Hold on,

33:32.532 --> 33:35.317
if you knew
how I felt about Chris,

33:35.361 --> 33:38.451
why were you pushing me so hard
to go on a date with this...

33:38.494 --> 33:40.235
- Darcy?
- Yeah.

33:40.279 --> 33:42.324
'Cause watching you squirm
all day was pretty funny, man.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.067
So there is no Darcy?

33:46.111 --> 33:47.677
No, there's a Darcy.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.505
What about
the sailing trip?

33:49.549 --> 33:52.595
Looks like it's just gonna be me
along for the ride.

33:53.596 --> 33:54.945
Send me a postcard?

33:54.989 --> 33:56.643
No, not gonna have time,
my friend.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.957
Hondo.
Glad I caught you.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.395
Hey.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.136
How's Mama Pina doing?

34:11.179 --> 34:13.529
Not good.
She's, uh, she's dying.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.792
They're moving her into hospice.

34:15.836 --> 34:16.837
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.578
She, uh, asked me to, um,

34:18.621 --> 34:20.536
help her find a shelter
for the women she looks after.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.190
Well, listen, if you need
a hand with any of that,

34:22.234 --> 34:23.713
you let me know.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.019
I know Nichelle's
got connections to shelters,

34:25.063 --> 34:27.369
and I think Street does, too.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.979
We'll find them all
a place to go.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.591
- You don't worry about that.
- Thanks.

34:31.634 --> 34:34.202
I just don't think
it's enough, though.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.639
Mama Pina provides
more than shelter.

34:36.683 --> 34:40.034
She provides these women
with hope.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.123
When she's gone, I don't think

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
there'll be anyone
to replace her.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.565
You trying to tell me something?

34:49.609 --> 34:52.307
I've been thinking
about what's next

34:52.351 --> 34:53.961
for a while now.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.964
Ever since Erika died,
if I'm honest.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.966
It made me question everything.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.535
What I'm doing with my life,
how I want to spend my days.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.584
Taking over
the safe house feels like

35:08.628 --> 35:10.369
maybe the change
I've been looking for.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.461
But I love SWAT.

35:15.504 --> 35:17.419
I know you do.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.860
And I don't want to...

35:23.904 --> 35:25.732
I don't want to let you
or the team down.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.081
You won't.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.430
I feel like
I'm betraying you all.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.432
I ain't gonna lie,

35:30.476 --> 35:33.261
you leaving will feel like
the team's losing a limb.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.309
But everyone will understand.

35:37.352 --> 35:40.138
And if you feel this is
the right thing to do...

35:41.574 --> 35:43.750
I think maybe it is.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.840
Then maybe it is.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.625
Chris, you are one hell
of a SWAT officer,

35:49.669 --> 35:51.671
and the main reason is
'cause you got a heart.

35:53.325 --> 35:54.848
That's why I know
you're the best person

35:54.891 --> 35:56.850
to carry on
Mama Pina's work.

35:56.893 --> 36:00.027
And as far as SWAT goes,

36:00.070 --> 36:01.768
you are leaving behind
a legacy here

36:01.811 --> 36:03.770
that you can be damn proud of.

36:03.813 --> 36:06.338
Two women graduated
SWAT academy this year

36:06.381 --> 36:08.383
because they followed
in your footsteps.

36:15.303 --> 36:18.132
This has been home for so long.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.178
This will always be your home.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.877
Come here.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.200
I think he's done.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.897
Just taking your advice.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.509
You hear anything
about that guy?

36:47.553 --> 36:49.032
- The one I shot?
- No.

36:49.076 --> 36:50.599
Let you know as soon as I do.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.822
Hey, Cabrera.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.127
You doing okay?

36:57.171 --> 36:58.390
I don't know.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.130
Everyone else seems
so squared away,

37:00.174 --> 37:02.394
but my head won't stop buzzing.

37:02.437 --> 37:03.569
Well, everyone deals
with the pressure

37:03.612 --> 37:05.005
of this job differently.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.399
I mean, working it out,
the adrenaline

37:07.442 --> 37:10.663
is one thing,

37:10.706 --> 37:13.753
working out what's inside
your head, that's, uh,

37:13.796 --> 37:16.277
something
entirely different.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.018
But if you don't,

37:18.061 --> 37:20.325
if you lock it in, that's-that's
gonna get you into trouble.

37:20.368 --> 37:23.458
Trust me.
Lot of good SWAT officers,

37:23.502 --> 37:25.243
they break down 'cause
they haven't figured out

37:25.286 --> 37:26.505
how to process things.

37:26.548 --> 37:28.942
- How do you do that, though?
- Best way

37:28.985 --> 37:30.465
is to talk it out.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.119
You know, Dr. Wendy's
available to us.

37:33.555 --> 37:34.861
A lot of officers
say that she helps.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.733
Does that include you?

37:37.777 --> 37:40.388
Let's just say
Dr. Wendy's great, but...

37:40.432 --> 37:42.564
I found something that works
a little better for me.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.834
David, good to see you.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.923
Father Jack,
nice to see you.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.186
Like you to meet a friend
of mine. This is Alexis Cabrera.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.492
She's new to SWAT.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.667
Alexis, nice to meet you.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.800
You, too.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.105
Father, do you have
five minutes?

38:02.149 --> 38:04.543
Of course.
Of course. Come on in.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.943
Hey. What you
doing here?

38:13.987 --> 38:16.859
I just came by to talk
to Hondo about something.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.340
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.646
I just, uh... What...

38:20.689 --> 38:23.344
I, uh...

38:23.388 --> 38:25.303
I just quit SWAT.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.130
What?

38:27.174 --> 38:29.176
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take over

38:29.219 --> 38:31.439
the safe house
from Mama Pina.

38:31.483 --> 38:33.920
It's-it's a long story.
I-I'll tell you later.

38:33.963 --> 38:37.227
Wh... You're-you're leaving?
You're leaving SWAT?

38:37.271 --> 38:39.447
In two weeks, yeah.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.536
I didn't...

38:41.580 --> 38:44.104
I didn't even know that you
were thinking about this.

38:44.147 --> 38:47.063
I've been, uh...

38:47.107 --> 38:49.849
I've been restless for months.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.808
Wow.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.723
I mean...

38:54.767 --> 38:57.160
it's not gonna be
the same without you.

38:57.204 --> 38:59.902
Obviously.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.514
Hey, this is,
this is so weird.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.863
I was just coming
to see you.

39:03.906 --> 39:06.692
I-I wanted to talk to you
about something.

39:06.735 --> 39:09.129
And now this feels
like crazy timing.

39:09.172 --> 39:11.392
What are you talking about?

39:11.436 --> 39:13.873
I was coming to tell you

39:13.916 --> 39:15.831
that I want us

39:15.875 --> 39:18.660
to just do whatever we
have to do to make things work.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.532
I want us to be together.
And now,

39:20.575 --> 39:22.055
now that you're leaving SWAT,

39:22.098 --> 39:24.318
we can be.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.538
What about, what about
the flight attendant?

39:26.581 --> 39:28.061
Flight... What?

39:28.104 --> 39:30.890
Really?

39:30.933 --> 39:33.327
We deserve a chance.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.590
Us.

39:35.634 --> 39:37.940
Isn't this what we've
been waiting for?

39:37.984 --> 39:40.769
I didn't quit SWATfor you.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.641
I quit for me.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.210
I'm sorry.
I-I-I just...

39:47.254 --> 39:49.604
I just, I just don't think
we're meant to be.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.084
If it was gonna happen,
it would've,

39:51.127 --> 39:52.738
it would've
happened by now.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.959
You're the one that didn't
let it happen because

39:57.003 --> 39:59.397
of the job, but now
you're quitting that job.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.137
N-Now you're saying
that it's too late?

40:01.181 --> 40:02.225
I-I don't understand.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.144
It's just the truth, okay?

40:08.188 --> 40:09.668
- Truth?
- Yeah.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.278
You want to talk
about truth?

40:11.321 --> 40:13.367
- Tell me you don't love me.
- Oh, my God.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.456
Chris, hey, tell me
you don't love me.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.979
Just say it.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.329
Look me in the eyes.
Look at me.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.593
Tell me you
don't love me.

40:23.551 --> 40:26.641
- I can't, I can't do this.
- Why not?

40:26.685 --> 40:30.079
I can't do this. I can't... Chris. Why? Why? Why?

40:30.123 --> 40:32.560
- I can't do this right now.
- Why?

40:32.604 --> 40:33.953
Why?

40:36.477 --> 40:38.174
Hey.

40:45.312 --> 40:47.270
Okay.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.229
You know what?
I'm done.
