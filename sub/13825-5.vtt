WEBVTT

02:54.215 --> 02:55.341
Hmm.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.880
Huh? W-What? Thomas.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.967
Get out of my room, you crazy cat.

05:08.307 --> 05:11.477
Go back downstairs, Thomas.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.448
Thomas!

05:24.991 --> 05:27.744
Get off me.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.288
Don't tell me you're afraid
of that little mouse.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.916
Has your pea brain dropped
right out of your soft little head?

05:33.916 --> 05:36.252
Heavens, this cat's off his nut.

07:58.186 --> 08:02.273
Close the door, Thomas.
You'll let the weirdoes in.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.808
Come, Thomas,
there's much work to be done.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.575
Be careful
with my monster-hunting equipment.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.005
V-- V-- Van Helsing.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.091
The famous monster hunter.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.302
What are you doing here
at the monster convention?

09:13.302 --> 09:16.305
Business and pleasure.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.984
I'm going to get you, Van Helsing.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.403
Hmm.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.364
Thomas, I forgot my silver werewolf trap.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.866
Take the luggage upstairs.
Guard my equipment.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.244
I'll be back before midnight.

10:15.114 --> 10:19.660
Welcome to Monster Con. I am the count.

10:19.660 --> 10:24.749
As one of the first guests to arrive,
allow me to get your ID badge...

10:25.666 --> 10:26.751
...and to say--

10:32.089 --> 10:35.217
Fine, get your own badge.

10:56.197 --> 11:00.076
Hi, I'm Jasper, the social ghost.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.327
Wanna be my friend?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.332
Guess not.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.256
What the--?

11:14.256 --> 11:17.426
Hey, pal, we got this room till 3:30.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.513
Yeah, the sign-up sheet is outside.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.432
Uh-oh. Is that a ghost vac?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.645
Oh, how rude.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.855
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.360
Help. Help.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.350
Hello? Hello?

12:09.687 --> 12:12.231
Me love Monster Con.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.404
Mummy outfit ruined.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.781
Me go home now.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.284
Never win costume contest.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.754
What's going on here?

13:58.754 --> 14:01.840
My word. Is that a werewolf cat?

14:01.840 --> 14:05.177
- Huh?
- I've never trapped one of those before.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.304
I'll add it to my collection.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.028
Ah. Battery bad.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.950
Wha--? No.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.837
I've got you in my sights, werewolf cat.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.634
You can't escape from Van Helsing.

17:41.602 --> 17:45.981
So we got a pair
of newcomers to the cursed forest.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.486
Finally, some entertainment.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.950
Yeah, I got bat wings.
And it ain't polite to stare.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.454
That's just the way
things work around here.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.665
Oh, boy, I guess I gotta explain.

18:07.044 --> 18:12.049
You see, this is a cursed forest,
and I'm, uh, sort of a bat now.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.720
Listen, I don't make the rules,
I just follow them.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.889
And here's the main one:

18:18.889 --> 18:24.686
Anytime somebody enters the forest,
at least one sucker has gotta stay behind.

18:24.686 --> 18:29.316
But because there's two of you,
only one has gotta stay.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.568
Forever.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.739
Yeah, that forever bit always gets them.

18:35.739 --> 18:40.202
Hey, wait a minute.
If I get out of here first, I can leave.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.207
Uh, ahem.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.669
Oh, hello.
You weren't supposed to hear that.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.920
So long, suckers.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.186
Nuts. Exploding nuts.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.356
You ain't seen the last of me.

20:09.082 --> 20:13.670
Like I said,
one of us has gotta stay behind.

20:14.963 --> 20:18.133
The waterfall?
That's our ticket out of here.

20:18.133 --> 20:23.722
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "our"?
I meant my.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.807
See you.

20:55.837 --> 21:00.175
Yahoo! I'm the first one out.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.761
Hey, no wings.

21:02.761 --> 21:08.016
Wait a minute,
if I ain't got wings, I can't fly.
