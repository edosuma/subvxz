WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:04.308
HERE'S THE THING.
I HAVE POWERS,

00:04.482 --> 00:05.701
WHICH MEANS MY SISTER
HAS POWERS, TOO.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.007
SO IF THE DEMON THAT
TOOK HER WANTED TO USE

00:07.181 --> 00:08.530
HER POWERS FOR EVIL,
THE ONLY PLACE HE

00:08.704 --> 00:11.533
COULD DO THAT WOULD BE
CORPORATE AMERICA. SO...

00:11.707 --> 00:13.926
SO YOU THINK THIS IS SOME
KIND OF DEMONIC CONSPIRACY?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.711
EXACTLY. WHAT YOU THINK?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.800
WELL, I THINK IF IT IS,

00:17.974 --> 00:19.454
IT'LL STILL BE THERE
TOMORROW.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.673
TODAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
PICK UP YOUR PARENTS.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.110
NO, WAIT.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.328
NO. NO WAITING.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.286

A VERY LONG WAY

00:25.460 --> 00:26.330
TO SEE YOU, BILLIE.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.940
YOUR IDEA, NOT MINE.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.072
YEAH, AND I THINK IT WAS
A VERY GOOD IDEA, THANK YOU.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.334
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
MET THEM YET.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.249
OH, COME ON.
THEY CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

00:32.423 --> 00:35.513
NO? MY FATHER IS A ROBOT,
MY MOTHER IS A WALLFLOWER,

00:35.687 --> 00:37.472
AND THEY HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT MY SISTER IN YEARS.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.430
AND THAT'S WHY WE
INVITED THEM TO DINNER.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.910
TRUST ME, OK?

00:41.084 --> 00:42.651
A LITTLE BIT OF PIPER'S
FOOD, SOME NICE WINE,

00:42.825 --> 00:44.131
AND EVERYONE WILL BE
ABLE TO RELAX.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.828
OH, YOU CANNOT RELAX
AROUND THEM.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.569
THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE.
AND, PLUS,

00:47.743 --> 00:49.962
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT WITCHES OR MAGIC.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.486
WELL, THEY MUST HAVE
SOME IDEA.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.965
ESPECIALLY IF YOU GUYS
BOTH HAVE POWERS.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.924
I THINK WE WERE
BOTH ADOPTED.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.969
ANYWAYS, LET ME GET BACK
TO MY THEORY.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.841
SO I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH
ONE OF THOSE MUCKY-MUCKS

00:59.015 --> 01:00.495

AND I THINK

01:00.669 --> 01:04.020
IF I CAN JUST GET HIM TO
TOUCH THIS PAPER I ENCHANTED,

01:04.194 --> 01:05.674
I'LL KNOW HE'S MAGICAL,

01:05.848 --> 01:07.458
AND THEN I'LL KNOW
I'M ON TO SOMETHING.

01:07.632 --> 01:08.851
WAIT A MINUTE. HOW DO
YOU KNOW THAT WORKS?

01:09.025 --> 01:10.940
WELL, I TESTED IT ON PAIGE
A FEW DAYS AGO.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.855
PLEASE DON'T TELL HER.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.946
OK, HERE'S THE DEAL.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.687
IF YOU WANT TO BORROW
MY CAR, YOU CAN.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.254
GREAT.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.342
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE GOING
TO PICK UP YOUR PARENTS,

01:21.516 --> 01:23.518
OK, NOT CHASE SOME LEAD.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.259
IT CAN'T BE AS BAD
AS YOU THINK.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.087
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WHO KNOWS?
THEY MAY EVEN SURPRISE YOU.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.827
SURPRISE ME?

01:29.001 --> 01:30.786
THEY ARE GOING TO SUCK
THE LIFE OUT OF THIS PLACE.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.327
DOMINIC, EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE FINE.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.763
JUST MAKE SURE YOU
HAVE ENOUGH BEER,

02:34.937 --> 02:36.068
TURN THE MUSIC UP,
TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN LOW,

02:36.243 --> 02:37.766
AND YOU'LL BE FINE.
ALL RIGHT?

02:37.940 --> 02:40.334
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER. BYE.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.513

GOING TO GO WORK UPSTAIRS.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.328

03:18.502 --> 03:21.244
WELL, YEAH. OK, NO,
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.115

03:23.290 --> 03:25.161
A LITTLE TROUBLE
WITH MY COLUMN.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.251
REALLY? COULD YOU TURN
TO THE CAMERA

03:28.425 --> 03:30.210

MORE ABOUT THAT PROBLEM?

03:32.647 --> 03:34.344

QUITE SIMPLE.

IF SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE

03:40.307 --> 03:41.612

03:41.786 --> 03:43.440
BECAUSE SHE'S SO CLOSE
TO HER BROTHER.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.443
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:46.617 --> 03:49.664
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I THINK,
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.927
BUT I HAVE TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING FAST

03:52.101 --> 03:54.103

IS TOMORROW.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.334
YEP.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.946
Phoebe: HEY, YOU OK?

20:52.120 --> 20:53.339
0H, YEAH, SURE,

20:53.513 --> 20:55.123
CONSIDERING MY PARENTS
TRIED TO SHOOT ME.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.038
Paige: WELL, IF IT MAKES
YOU FEEL BETTER, YOU KNOW,

20:57.212 --> 20:59.214
THEY WEREN'T REALLY YOUR
PARENTS WHEN THEY DID THAT.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.695
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE YOUR PARENTS.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.828
BUT THEY ARE YOUR PARENTS
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.222
JUST KEEP MIXING.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.093
I JUST STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.965
WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.358
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.230
I KNOW, BUT STILL.
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO WEIRD,

21:15.404 --> 21:17.885
BUT I CAN REMEMBER THEM BEING
LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.887
WHAT, LIKE ASSASSINS?

21:20.061 --> 21:21.715
NO, HAPPY. TOGETHER--

21:21.889 --> 21:23.891
WORKING TOGETHER, LAUGHING.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.067
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN CHRISTY
GOT KIDNAPPED, IT ALL JUST--

21:26.241 --> 21:27.938
WELL, IT'S THE HARDEST
THING IN THE WORLD

21:28.112 --> 21:29.026
TO LOSE A CHILD.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.115
I KNOW. I KNOW THAT.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.769
EVEN THOUGH I MAY HAVE
JUST BEEN 5,

21:32.943 --> 21:36.469
I MISS THE WAY
IT USED TO BE. WELL,

21:36.643 --> 21:38.732
I GUESS IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
THEY HAVE IT IN THEM STILL.

21:38.906 --> 21:42.257
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THEY'LL
BE LIKE THAT AGAIN SOON

21:42.431 --> 21:43.824
AFTER YOU FIND CHRISTY.

21:43.998 --> 21:44.955
[DOORBELL RINGS]

21:45.129 --> 21:47.393
PIPER?

21:47.567 --> 21:48.785
UH, NO, SHE'S
WITH THE BABIES,

21:48.959 --> 21:50.047
PUTTING THEM DOWN
FOR A NAP.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.180
HERE. I THINK I KNOW
WHO IT IS.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.486
OH, AND, UH,

21:53.660 --> 21:55.314
WE LUCKED OUT WITH
HER PARENTS BEFORE,

21:55.488 --> 21:56.663
BUT WE NEED
TO STOP THEM

21:56.837 --> 21:57.881
BEFORE THEY
KILL AN INNOCENT.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.666
I KNOW, I KNOW.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.977
HENRY, HI.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.414
DID YOU GET
ANY OF MY CALLS?

22:08.588 --> 22:10.894
YEAH, I GOT
ALL YOUR CALLS.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.767
OK, YOU'RE MAD.
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.770
I CAN EXPLAIN, THOUGH,
ALL RIGHT?

22:16.944 --> 22:18.989
THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO EXPLAIN.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.600
YOU STOOD ME UP.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.166
ONE OF MY PAROLEES
SKIPPED OUT.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.385
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

22:23.559 --> 22:24.430
CALL ME.

22:24.604 --> 22:26.040
OH, I DID.
I TRIED CALLING.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.650
BEFORE, HENRY. NOT AFTER.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.087
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.
I'M A BIG GIRL. I REALLY AM.

22:30.261 --> 22:33.177
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT
WITH ME, PLEASE JUST SAY SO

22:33.352 --> 22:35.789
BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT INTO
THE WHOLE GAME-PLAYING THING.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.965
I'M NOT PLAYING
ANY GAMES, PAIGE.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS HARD THIS EARLY.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.012
I DON'T KNOW. I KEEP FEELING
LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING OFF,

22:42.186 --> 22:44.493
OR THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME, SOME SORT OF SECRET.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.103
WHAT ARE YOU NOT
TELLING ME?

22:46.277 --> 22:48.410
DON'T TURN THIS AROUND
ON ME.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.413
NO, I'LL ADMIT--
I HAVE MY SECRETS.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.154
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU MARRIED?

22:53.328 --> 22:55.983
NO, I'M NOT MARRIED.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.463
LOOK, WE BOTH KNOW

22:57.637 --> 22:59.726
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME
SOMETHING HERE, OK?

22:59.900 --> 23:03.643
I HAVE TROUBLE GETTING
CLOSE TO PEOPLE, PAIGE.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.079
AND I KNOW IT DOESN'T
LET ME OFF THE HOOK,

23:05.253 --> 23:06.559
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
HOLDING BACK ON ME--

23:06.733 --> 23:08.648
PAIGE! WE GOT TO MOVE.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.825
UH, SO WE CAN GET
THE THING FROM THE THING

23:11.999 --> 23:13.087
FOR THE THING.

23:13.261 --> 23:16.786
YEAH. UM, OK.
WELL, I HAVE TO GO.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.397
I'LL CALL YOU.

23:18.571 --> 23:19.659
YOU PROMISE?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.182
PROMISE.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.191
SORRY, IT'S JUST
HER PARENTS STOPPED MOVING.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.540
RIGHT WHERE I WAS
TRYING TO PROVE

23:31.714 --> 23:33.803
MY CONSPIRACY
THEORY, TOO.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.501
WHAT CONSPIRACY THEORY?

23:35.675 --> 23:37.851
THE ONE ABOUT MY SISTER BEING
ONE OF MANY POWERFUL KIDS

23:38.025 --> 23:40.201
THAT WAS KIDNAPPED BY DEMONS.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.898
THINK "MANCHURIAN
CANDIDATE."

23:42.072 --> 23:42.943
WHICH VERSION?

23:43.117 --> 23:45.032
DOES IT MATTER?

23:45.206 --> 23:46.512
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT MY
PARENTS ARE DOING HERE ANYWAY.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.035
I MEAN IT'S TOO BIG
OF A COINCIDENCE TO BE

23:48.209 --> 23:49.732
A COINCIDENCE, RIGHT?

23:49.906 --> 23:52.039
WELL, MAYBE THERE REALLY ARE
DEMONS AT THE COMPANY,

23:52.213 --> 23:53.649
AND THEY KNOW YOU'RE
ON TO THEM.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.216
Paige: MAYBE
THEY'RE USING

23:55.390 --> 23:56.652
YOUR PARENTS
AS LEVERAGE.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.177
THIS TIME, YOU'RE GOING,
I'M STAYING.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.614
WAIT, BUT--
NO BUTS.

24:01.788 --> 24:02.919
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE UP AGAINST,

24:03.093 --> 24:04.530
AND YOU HAVE MORE
FIREPOWER THAN I DO.

24:04.704 --> 24:05.922
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE GOT
THE POTIONS.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.402
THEY'RE ONLY
STUN POTIONS.

24:07.576 --> 24:08.838
SO, WE CAN MAKE
VAGUE WISHING POTIONS.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.537
WE DON'T HAVE TIME. MY
PARENTS DON'T HAVE TIME.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.411
LOOK, YOU CAN'T
HOLE UP HERE ANYMORE.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.893
AND YOU CAN'T BUSY YOURSELF
WITH ENDLESS TASKS, OK?

24:20.067 --> 24:22.025
YOU HAVE TO GET BACK
OUT THERE AND FIGHT...

24:24.898 --> 24:26.160
FOR LEO.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.656
DO YOU SEE THEM
ANYWHERE?

24:43.830 --> 24:45.440
Billie: NOPE.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.007
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY'RE IN THERE?

24:47.181 --> 24:50.314
WELL, DALVOS IS HERE,
SO THEY HAVE TO BE CLOSE.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.060
EXCUSE ME.
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

24:57.234 --> 24:59.149
HELP YOURSELF.

25:01.761 --> 25:05.504
[APPLAUSE]

25:09.246 --> 25:12.902
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.644
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

25:15.818 --> 25:19.996
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT
WHERE OUR COMPANY IS GOING NEXT,

25:20.170 --> 25:23.173
BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR BUSINESSES,

25:23.347 --> 25:25.393
AND IN TERMS OF
THE BROADER QUESTION:

25:25.567 --> 25:29.440
WILL PELHAM GO PUBLIC
OR REMAIN PRIVATE?

25:29.615 --> 25:32.313
IT'S THIS QUESTION
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS TODAY.

25:32.487 --> 25:35.272
NOW, PELHAM IS
A FAMILY COMPANY,

25:35.446 --> 25:38.058
FOUNDED ON OLD-FASHIONED VALUES:

25:38.232 --> 25:39.668
TRUST, HARD WORK,
AND RESULTS.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.714
Billie: OH, THERE THEY ARE.
2 TABLES FROM THE FRONT.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.106
WELL, AT LEAST THEY'RE OK.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.499
HOW ARE WE GOING TO
GET THEM OUT OF HERE?

25:44.673 --> 25:46.936
WE WAIT.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.982
Grant:
SO I THINK THE REAL QUESTION

25:49.156 --> 25:50.766
WE SHOULD BE ASKING IS,

25:50.940 --> 25:55.379
WHICH DIRECTION WILL BETTER
SERVE THESE CORE VALUES?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.818
SO, AFTER MUCH
CONSIDERATION,

25:58.992 --> 26:02.691
I WANT TO REASSURE EVERYONE
IN EVERY DIVISION,

26:02.865 --> 26:05.172
FROM MICROCHIPS
TO MACRO TURBINES,

26:05.346 --> 26:08.654
THAT PELHAM IS GOING
TO REMAIN--

26:11.874 --> 26:15.530
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

26:17.358 --> 26:19.752
AAH! HOT!

26:19.926 --> 26:21.144
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.885
WHY WOULD THEY WANT
TO SHOOT HIM?

26:23.059 --> 26:25.453
BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO.
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

26:25.627 --> 26:27.150
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU VANQUISH ME,

26:27.324 --> 26:29.326
IT WON'T SAVE
MOMMY AND DADDY.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.937
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

26:31.111 --> 26:32.895
BECAUSE THE CHAIRMAN
IS STILL GOING TO DIE.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.855
AND THEY WILL STILL BE
BLAMED FOR HIS MURDER.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.816
AND AFTERWARDS,
OUR GREATEST CREATION--

26:40.990 --> 26:44.646
FOR ALL INTENTS
AND PURPOSES, A HUMAN--

26:44.820 --> 26:47.475
ROD DALVOS WILL TAKE OVER,

26:47.649 --> 26:50.434
AND WITH IT GIVE US
THE DEMONIC FOOTHOLD

26:50.609 --> 26:52.828
WE'VE WORKED
A GENERATION TO ACHIEVE.

26:53.002 --> 26:55.352
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO
ACCOMPLISH ALL THIS?

27:20.203 --> 27:21.944
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST CAME TO ME.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.685
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY
I HAD SUCH A HARD TIME

27:23.859 --> 27:25.426
WITH THE QUESTION
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.384
Dorrie: BUT IT'S BRILLIANT,
PHOEBE, REALLY.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.864
OH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT BRILLIANT.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.561
ARE YOU KIDDING?

27:30.736 --> 27:33.913
"SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN RELY
A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON A SIBLING

27:34.087 --> 27:35.523
"FOR THEIR EMOTIONAL NEEDS,

27:35.697 --> 27:38.613
"NOT BEING OPEN TO FINDING
LOVE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME.

27:38.787 --> 27:42.269
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO MOVE OUT TO MOVE ON."

27:42.443 --> 27:43.574
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THAT?

27:43.749 --> 27:46.316
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I CAN RELATE.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.406
AND IT TOOK ME A LITTLE
WHILE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.756
YOU KNOW?

27:50.930 --> 27:53.454
AND, UH, SOME PEACE
AND QUIET.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.110
WE GOT BIG PROBLEMS.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.285
SO MUCH
FOR PEACE AND QUIET.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.852
OK, GET THAT TO COPY
RIGHT AWAY

28:00.026 --> 28:01.070
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO MISS THE DEADLINE.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.289
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

28:02.463 --> 28:03.594
WHERE ARE THE BOYS?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.074
THEY'RE STILL NAPPING.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.772
OK, I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE THEM TO DAD'S.

28:06.946 --> 28:07.773
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO BE AROUND HERE.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.122
AND JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

28:09.296 --> 28:10.340
I'M NOT DUCKING A FIGHT.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.299
I'M JUST PROTECTING MY KIDS.

28:13.474 --> 28:14.823
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:14.997 --> 28:16.042
WHAT'S GOING ON IS
MY PARENTS JUST TRIED

28:16.216 --> 28:16.956
TO KILL SOMEONE.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.261
Paige: BUT THEY DIDN'T.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.350
Phoebe: OH, WELL,
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.526
YEAH, EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE
WANTED FOR MURDER.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.485
SEE, THEY WERE SET UP
BY THIS DEMON WHO WAS--

28:24.659 --> 28:25.921
A HUMAN DEMON.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.401
YEAH, WHO WANTS TO
TAKE OVER A COMPANY.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.142
BACK UP. A HUMAN DEMON?

28:29.316 --> 28:30.447
YEAH, DALVOS,
THE GUY I MET,

28:30.621 --> 28:31.971
HE HIRED MY PARENTS
TO KILL HIS BOSS.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.712
WELL, HE, ACTUALLY
HIRED THE NANNY.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.975
WAIT. THE DEMON HAS A NANNY?

28:36.149 --> 28:37.977
WELL, SHE'S REALLY THE ONE
WHO'S PULLING THE STRINGS.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.369
YEAH, AND SHE'S TRYING
TO FRAME MY PARENTS,

28:39.543 --> 28:41.110
SO WE HAVE TO GET TO
THEM BEFORE SHE DOES.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.372
OR THE POLICE DO.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.505
[SIGHS]

28:51.033 --> 28:52.339

WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT

28:52.513 --> 28:54.123
TO SHOOT YOUR COUSIN?

28:54.297 --> 28:57.518
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY'D WANT TO KILL GRANT.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.825
I MEAN, I ASSUME IT'S
CONNECTED TO THEIR DAUGHTER

28:59.999 --> 29:01.522
COMING TO ASK FOR
OUR HELP YESTERDAY.

29:01.696 --> 29:02.653
Reporter: HELP FOR WHAT?

29:02.828 --> 29:04.917
HELP IN FINDING HER SISTER.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.701
I GUESS SHE THOUGHT
SINCE I, TOO,

29:06.875 --> 29:09.008
WAS A KIDNAP VICTIM AS
A CHILD, WE COULD HELP.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.706
WE LOOKED INTO THE POSSIBILITY,
OF COURSE.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.316
BUT WHEN GRANT DISCOVERED

29:13.490 --> 29:15.014
THAT HER PARENTS HAD SPENT
THE PAST 15 YEARS

29:15.188 --> 29:17.364
SEARCHING FOR THEIR DAUGHTER
WITH NO SUCCESS,

29:17.538 --> 29:20.497
HE DECIDED THERE WASN'T
REALLY ANYTHING WE COULD DO.

29:23.196 --> 29:26.155
OBVIOUSLY,
MR. AND MRS. JENKINS

29:26.329 --> 29:28.288
DIDN'T LIKE THAT ANSWER.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.560
HOW LONG BEFORE
I BECOME CHAIRMAN?

29:41.344 --> 29:45.261
WE WAIT FOR A RESPECTABLE
PERIOD OF MOURNING.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.482
AFTER ALL, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO APPEAR TOO ANXIOUS

29:48.656 --> 29:51.528
OR CAST UNWANTED SUSPICIONS,
NOW, WOULD WE?

29:51.702 --> 29:53.226
ALL RIGHT.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.618
THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.359
WE TAKE CARE OF LOOSE ENDS.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.492
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.981
YEAH?

30:10.591 --> 30:13.246
YOU'LL TEXT ME WHERE
TO FIND THIS LOOSE END?

30:13.420 --> 30:15.074
CONSIDER IT DONE.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.162

30:16.336 --> 30:18.338
YES?

30:18.512 --> 30:22.081
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE DO I FIND THE MARK?

30:27.129 --> 30:28.087
Piper: HOW'S IT GOING?

30:28.261 --> 30:30.916
OH, NOT GOOD.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.613
THEY'VE SPLIT UP, AND
THEY KEEP MOVING AROUND.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.006
EVERY TIME THE CRYSTAL DROPS,

30:34.180 --> 30:35.572
IT JUMPS SOMEPLACE ELSE.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.618
WELL, MAYBE THEY KNOW
SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR THEM.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.881
I THINK EVERYONE'S
LOOKING FOR THEM.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.274
Piper: WHERE'S PAIGE?

30:41.448 --> 30:42.449
SHE'S UPSTAIRS
TRYING TO FIND

30:42.623 --> 30:44.103
THE DEMON NANNY
IN THE BOOK.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.104
Dalvos, on computer:
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHY

30:45.278 --> 30:46.105
THEY'D WANT TO KILL GRANT.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.323
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

30:47.497 --> 30:48.803
Dalvos: I MEAN,
I CAN ONLY ASSUME

30:48.977 --> 30:49.543
IT'S CONNECTED TO THEIR
DAUGHTER COMING TO...

30:49.717 --> 30:50.718
BILLIE!
WHAT?

30:50.892 --> 30:52.111
Piper: DID YOU
FIND ANYTHING?

30:52.285 --> 30:53.373
JUST THIS.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.549
HELP IN FINDING HER SISTER.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.116
I GUESS SHE THOUGHT SINCE
I, TOO, HAD BEEN

30:57.290 --> 30:58.769
A KIDNAP
VICTIM AS A CHILD,

30:58.944 --> 31:01.642
THAT WE COULD DO SOMETHING.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.600
WE LOOKED INTO
THE POSSIBILITY, OF COURSE,

31:03.774 --> 31:05.254
BUT WHEN GRANT DISCOVERED

31:05.428 --> 31:06.603
THAT HER PARENTS HAVE SPENT
THE PAST 15 YEARS

31:06.777 --> 31:08.518
SEARCHING FOR HER
WITHOUT SUCCESS,

31:08.692 --> 31:12.479
HE DECIDED THERE WASN'T REALLY
ANYTHING WE COULD DO.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.394
OBVIOUSLY
MR. AND MRS. JENKINS

31:14.568 --> 31:16.004
DIDN'T LIKE THAT ANSWER.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.832
Billie: THIS IS ALL OVER
THE INTERNET.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.790
I MEAN, THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR HER,

31:19.965 --> 31:22.054
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.882
OK. WE'RE GOING
TO FIND THEM, BILLIE.

31:24.056 --> 31:25.405
Billie: HOW? SCRYING
ISN'T WORKING.

31:25.579 --> 31:28.408
YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE
MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY.

31:28.582 --> 31:29.844
IF CHRISTY AND BILLIE
BOTH HAVE POWERS,

31:30.018 --> 31:31.367
DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT
THEIR PARENTS HAVE

31:31.541 --> 31:32.542
TO BE THE CARRIERS?

31:32.716 --> 31:34.675
IF IT'S IN THE BLOOD.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.677
RIGHT. SO WOULDN'T
THAT MEAN

31:36.851 --> 31:38.026
THAT THE "CALL FOR
A LOST WITCH" SPELL

31:38.200 --> 31:39.419
MIGHT WORK?

31:51.257 --> 31:52.171
HELEN.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.130
CARL.

31:55.304 --> 31:56.523
I HAD NO IDEA.

31:56.697 --> 31:57.872
ME NEITHER.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.265
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

31:59.439 --> 32:00.570
HEH HEH.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.355
WE HAVE A CHOICE?

32:02.529 --> 32:04.444
YOU COULD DROP YOUR GUN.

32:04.618 --> 32:09.405
[CHUCKLES]
OR YOU COULD DROP YOURS.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.846
THIS ISN'T HOW
I WANTED IT TO END.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.892
ME NEITHER.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.592
I LOVE YOU.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.420
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.643
FREEZE THEM.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.601
ONE MOVE, AND YOU DIE.

32:40.523 --> 32:41.437
WHO ARE YOU?
WHO HIRED YOU?

32:41.611 --> 32:44.658
WHO HIRED US?

32:44.832 --> 32:47.574
Carl: TO TAKE US OUT.
WE WANT NAMES. NOW!

32:47.748 --> 32:49.315
BILLIE, I DON'T REALLY WANT

32:49.489 --> 32:50.838
TO BLOW UP
YOUR PARENTS, BUT--

32:51.012 --> 32:53.884
ALL RIGHT. STOP IT.
THIS IS CRAZY.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.235
YOU WANT TO SHOOT ME? IS
THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

32:56.409 --> 32:57.366
EASY, BILLIE.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.977
YOU ALREADY LOST
ONE DAUGHTER.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.891
YOU WANT TO LOSE
ANOTHER ONE, TOO?

33:04.547 --> 33:06.245
DO YOU WANT TO PULL
THAT TRIGGER, MOM?

33:06.419 --> 33:07.594
IT'S NOT GOING TO
BRING CHRISTY BACK,

33:07.768 --> 33:09.291
AND I KNOW THAT'S
THE ONE THING YOU WANT

33:09.465 --> 33:12.381
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THIS WORLD.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.296
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

33:14.470 --> 33:16.516
YOU KEPT SEARCHING
FOR HER?

33:16.690 --> 33:18.257
DON'T YOU THINK
I NEEDED TO KNOW,

33:18.431 --> 33:20.737
THAT I WANTED TO KNOW?
I WAS JUST A KID.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.088
I WAS SCARED AND YOUNG,

33:23.262 --> 33:25.264
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER,

33:25.438 --> 33:28.180
AND I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT ME OR HER.

33:28.354 --> 33:32.488
AND NOW, YOU'RE ALL
I HAVE LEFT.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.106
OH, BILLIE.

33:41.280 --> 33:46.285
I'M SO SORRY, BABY.

33:46.459 --> 33:48.809
Paige: HEY,
GUESS WHAT, GUYS.

33:48.983 --> 33:51.333
I THINK I FIGURED OUT
HOW TO CLEAR THEIR NAMES.

33:52.639 --> 33:53.770
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

33:53.944 --> 33:57.992
OHH, MY BABY.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.651
FIRST, I'D LIKE
TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING

34:04.825 --> 34:06.305
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. TRUST ME,

34:06.479 --> 34:07.871
I WOULDN'T HAVE
DRAGGED YOU ALL DOWN HERE

34:08.046 --> 34:09.786
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

34:12.180 --> 34:15.227
I WON'T BE TAKING THE
COMPANY PUBLIC AFTER ALL.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.620
IT'S STAYING
IN THE FAMILY, PRIVATE.

34:17.794 --> 34:20.014
JUST LIKE GRANT AND HIS FATHER
WANTED IT TO.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.669
SECONDLY, I WANTED
YOU ALL TO KNOW

34:22.843 --> 34:27.108
I'M NOT GOING TO BECOME THE NEXT
CHAIRMAN AFTER ALL BECAUSE...

34:27.282 --> 34:29.284
I'LL BE GOING TO JAIL
INSTEAD.

34:29.458 --> 34:33.984
[REPORTERS MURMURING]

34:34.159 --> 34:35.508
I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOT GRANT,

34:35.682 --> 34:37.205
NOT THAT GIRL'S PARENTS.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.772
I JUST MADE IT LOOK
LIKE THEY DID

34:38.946 --> 34:43.342
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY.

35:09.542 --> 35:14.590
WHOA. YOU SCARED ME.
WHAT'S WRONG?

35:14.764 --> 35:17.724
WHAT'S WRONG IS
IT'S OVER, DALVOS.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.856
30 YEARS
OF PLANNING GONE!

35:20.030 --> 35:21.771
WHAT? HOW?

35:21.945 --> 35:23.033
BECAUSE THE WITCHES
OUTSMARTED US,

35:23.208 --> 35:24.557
THAT'S HOW.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.428
THEY KNEW THEY COULDN'T
VANQUISH YOU,

35:26.602 --> 35:28.126
SO THEY RUINED YOU
INSTEAD.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.606
DESTROYED YOUR
REPUTATION.

35:30.780 --> 35:31.999
NOW WE'RE BOTH RUINED.

35:32.173 --> 35:35.481
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.835
WE TIE UP LOOSE ENDS.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.882
[GUNSHOT]

35:46.056 --> 35:48.885
Phoebe: AH, ANOTHER DAY,
ANOTHER DEMON.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.149
AH, DID THEY PRINT
MY SPEECH?

35:51.323 --> 35:52.280
IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH.

35:52.454 --> 35:53.890
OBVIOUSLY.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.631
TOO BAD MARY POPPINS
GOT AWAY.

35:55.805 --> 35:57.198
YEAH, WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.852
I'M SURE WE WILL BE
SEEING HER AGAIN

35:59.026 --> 36:00.549
IN ABOUT 30 YEARS OR SO.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.552
OH, WE WON'T BE DOING THIS
IN ANOTHER 30 YEARS.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.641
THEY WILL.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.427
I WONDER WHERE WE'LL BE.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.603
WELL, MY GUESS IS YOU'LL
BE SITTING RIGHT THERE

36:10.777 --> 36:14.172
FEEDING YOUR GRANDKIDS
WITH LEO.

36:14.346 --> 36:17.436
LET'S HOPE SO.

36:17.610 --> 36:18.915
PIPER, GIVE YOURSELF
A BREAK.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.788
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME TIME, YOU KNOW.

36:21.962 --> 36:24.356
AND YOU HAVE TO
ALLOW YOURSELF THAT TIME.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.923
SOUNDS LIKE GOOD ADVICE.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.708
DID YOU HAVE ANY
FOR THE TWINS?

36:28.882 --> 36:31.232
ACTUALLY, I DID.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.932
I SUGGESTED THAT SHE
MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE,

36:36.106 --> 36:38.413
GET HER OWN SPACE.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.856
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

36:47.030 --> 36:50.382
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, LET'S GO.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

36:50.556 --> 36:52.819
WATCH YOUR FINGERS,
FINGERS, FINGERS.

36:54.908 --> 36:57.606
COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.000
ALL RIGHTY.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.190
HEY.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.192
HEY.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.759
JUST A QUESTION.

37:19.933 --> 37:25.286
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU
TO GET CLOSE TO PEOPLE?

37:27.375 --> 37:29.029
WELL, YOU DON'T BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH, HUH?

37:29.203 --> 37:32.772
WELL, I FIGURE SINCE
YOU STOOD ME UP,

37:32.946 --> 37:35.035
I CAN ASK ANYTHING I WANT.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.820
I'M NOT MAD OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT. I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.996
I DON'T KNOW.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.479
I THINK BECAUSE I GREW UP
IN FOSTER HOMES, YOU KNOW,

37:44.653 --> 37:49.049
AND I JUST BOUNCED AROUND.
IT MADE ME NOT TRUST.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.790
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER I WOULD
GET CLOSE TO SOMEBODY,

37:50.964 --> 37:52.357
THEY WOULD LEAVE.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.229
I MEAN, REALLY,
I WOULD LEAVE.

37:55.403 --> 37:59.842
SO NOW IT'S YEARS LATER, AND
WHENEVER I LIKE SOMEONE...

38:01.975 --> 38:07.285
I'M SORRY. IT'S THAT
FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT THING.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.550
THERE'S NOTHING TO
BE SORRY FOR.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.249
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW...

38:17.077 --> 38:18.905
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
RUN FROM ME.

38:29.394 --> 38:35.791
YOU TWO. YOU FOUGHT LIKE
CATS AND DOGS, YOU KNOW.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.578
YOU WERE AS WILDLY DIFFERENT
AS ANY 2 KIDS COULD EVER BE.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.408
AND YOU WERE INSEPARABLE.

38:43.582 --> 38:45.192
WE WERE?

38:45.366 --> 38:47.150
OH, YEAH.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.851
OF COURSE CHRISTY LOVED
TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE--A LOT.

38:52.025 --> 38:55.158
IT TOOK YOUR FATHER AND ME A
WHILE TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.030
SHE WAS VERY SNEAKY THAT WAY.

38:57.204 --> 39:01.077
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER
THAT MUCH ABOUT HER.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.950
THERE'S LITTLE MOMENTS
AND THINGS HERE AND THERE,

39:04.124 --> 39:07.388
BUT MOST OF WHAT I
REMEMBER OF HER I LOVED.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.651
OH, HONEY...

39:14.264 --> 39:16.745
SHE ADORED YOU.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.573
SHE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE
OF YOU, TOO.

39:18.747 --> 39:22.142
NOBODY COULD PICK
ON YOU...EXCEPT HER.

39:23.970 --> 39:26.276
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU KEPT LOOKING FOR HER?

39:26.451 --> 39:30.803
I DON'T KNOW.
WE SHOULD HAVE.

39:33.327 --> 39:35.634
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.854
WHEN IT HAPPENED,
WE WERE DEVASTATED.

39:39.028 --> 39:42.684
MAYBE IT WAS WRONG
FOR ALL OF US,

39:42.858 --> 39:45.078
BUT WE MADE THE CHOICE
TO TRY AND MAKE LIFE

39:45.252 --> 39:47.776
AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE
FOR YOU.

39:47.950 --> 39:52.564
WE THOUGHT IF WE JUST
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT--

39:52.738 --> 39:57.699
MOM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OK. I UNDERSTAND.

40:01.703 --> 40:04.837
DID YOU KNOW CHRISTY WAS
A WITCH? I MEAN, THAT I WAS?

40:05.011 --> 40:09.102
MM-HMM. JUST LIKE
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

40:10.712 --> 40:13.280
I GUESS IT SKIPPED
A GENERATION, HUH?

40:13.454 --> 40:14.629
YEAH, LUCKY YOU.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.718
NO, LUCKY YOU.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.895
YOU HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL GIFT, BILLIE,

40:20.069 --> 40:22.985
ONE THAT YOU WERE MEANT
TO DO GREAT THINGS WITH.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.596
I KNOW THAT.

40:24.770 --> 40:27.207
JUST EMBRACE IT.

40:29.383 --> 40:32.342
I'M GOING
TO FIND HER, MOM.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.083
I PROMISE.

40:40.481 --> 40:43.528
WELL, MAYBE
THIS WILL HELP.

40:45.051 --> 40:49.142
IT'S CHRISTY'S DIARY. WE
NEVER COULD FIGURE OUT

40:49.316 --> 40:52.450
WHAT THE LAST ENTRY
MEANT. MAYBE YOU CAN.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.148
BE SAFE.

41:04.331 --> 41:05.375
BYE, MOM.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.465
BYE, BABY.
