Oh, son, when you're young,

00:17.017 --> 00:20.270
it's easy to think that older people
have all the answers.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.939

00:24.650 --> 00:26.527
SOPHIE'S SON [on phone]:
<i>Yeah, I actually dated a senior</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:29.029
<i>for a few months last semester,
so I-I know what you mean, you know?</i>

00:29.029 --> 00:31.532
Sweetie. I'm kind of
in the middle of a story here.

00:32.533 --> 00:36.119
Your generation just <i>loves</i>
to talk about themselves.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.996
Anyway, um,

00:37.996 --> 00:40.707
I had been dating Robert
for a few weeks,

00:40.707 --> 00:43.544
and it was putting
a real <i>spring</i> in my step.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.756
Guys! I just saw a pigeon

00:47.756 --> 00:49.925
on a romantic stroll...

00:49.925 --> 00:51.301
with a rat.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.721
Well, well, well, if it isn't
our long-lost lovestruck Sophie.

00:54.721 --> 00:58.225
You've been off in Robert-land forever.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.269
The apartment's a wreck,
and Cowgirl Cleanup

01:00.269 --> 01:01.687

We promised each other that
we wouldn't talk about Cowgirl Cleanup

01:11.363 --> 01:12.948
until the trademark clears.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.286
Okay. Yeah. I know I've been gone a lot,

01:17.286 --> 01:20.622
but it's just that Robert keeps
planning all of these amazing dates.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.458
I have not set an alarm in years.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.461
My body just naturally wakes up at 6 AM.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.298
You're amazing.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.593
This is my tomato bisque.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.014
Holy shit!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.475
Whoa!

01:40.475 --> 01:42.519
And then, we go back
to his apartment,

01:42.519 --> 01:45.314
which overlooks Central Park,
and we do it until the sun comes up.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.149
I got a question.
When you're "doing it,"

01:47.149 --> 01:50.235
do you ever accidentally activate
his Life Alert necklace?

01:51.445 --> 01:54.573
Ha. 'Cause he's older. Very funny. Yes.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.117
Does he sleep in one of those
floor-length grandpa nightgowns?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.077
Yeah, with one of
those long pointy hats?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.162
And he's all like,

02:00.162 --> 02:03.248
"honk-shoo, honk-shoo, mimimimimi!"

02:03.248 --> 02:05.584
Ignore them, Soph. I think it's great.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.462
It actually got me to widen
the age range on my dating apps,

02:08.462 --> 02:09.963
and I met someone.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.717
Wait, you're dating a new guy?
Well, how do I not know this?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.761
Well [sighs]-- I'm late to meet him.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.180
I'll fill you in later.
We can do Cowgirl Confessions.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.307
<i>Save it for the Sharks!</i>

02:22.768 --> 02:25.062
Guys, Robert is going
to be here any minute, okay?

02:25.062 --> 02:27.147
So, no more old man jokes.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.858
Of course not. We want him to feel
totally comfortable here.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.735
That's why Sid put prune juice on tap.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.531
What are we laughing at?

02:35.531 --> 02:38.742
We're just razzing our friend
'cause she's dating an old guy.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.077
Yeah.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.287
- I believe that's me.
- Oh, what?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.542
But, you're... beautiful.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.295
Uh, Robert, meet my friends.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.172
Friends, this is Robert.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.633
Zamn, Zaddy! Your skin is golden.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.804
It's like the flesh of a sun-dappled peach
on a late summer's evening.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.305
May I?
- Sure.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.434
Oh, my God. How do you get it
to stay so supple? It's so--

03:04.434 --> 03:06.770
Okay, we don't need another lawsuit. Yeah.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.522
Introductions are over.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.524
Ah, your friends are nice.
Little handsy, but nice.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.026
Uh, yeah, th-that's them in a nutshell.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.653
Hey, you know what?

03:14.653 --> 03:16.154
I was thinking...

03:16.905 --> 03:19.283
tonight, I would take you out.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.534
And by "out,"

03:20.534 --> 03:22.995
I mean, <i>in</i> to my apartment,

03:22.995 --> 03:24.997
where it's cozy. And cheap.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.834
A night in at your place sounds great.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.210
Yeah.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.796
You okay?

03:33.172 --> 03:35.632
I just kind of thought
he'd be, like, some old novelty

03:35.632 --> 03:38.510
she'd be into for a while,
and then get tired of, you know?

03:38.510 --> 03:41.013
Like those two weeks
she tried being a top hat person.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.223
You're sure it's not giving Lincoln?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.851
Only in that it's blowing my brains out.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.936
I'm sorry.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.480
Maybe his organs are in worse shape
than his outer body,

03:50.480 --> 03:51.982
and he won't live much longer.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.860
Probably not, though.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.862
He glows from within.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.573
Hey!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.241
Class of '88. Me, too.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.367
Huh?!

04:03.285 --> 04:05.495
I'm sorry.
What, you two are the same age?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.080
Looks like it.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.208
Does not!

04:11.293 --> 04:13.337
Sid, promise me that in 25 years,
we're gonna look like him,

04:13.337 --> 04:15.172
and not like him.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.341
Sorry, no offense.
- Huh?!

04:18.008 --> 04:21.136
Dude, of course, we're gonna age
like Robert. Look at us.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.013
No, you're right.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.932
And that one gray hair,
nothing to worry about.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.642
Exactly, dude. I barely even see it.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.102
- What, me?
- Yeah.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.979
No, I meant <i>your</i> gray hair.
I don't have any gray hair.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.105
Neither do I.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.483
No, no!

04:37.903 --> 04:39.154
What's up, sad boy?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.658
Figured you could use a hang.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.160
Plus, Rachel's still in Florida
taking care of her aunt.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.120
I'm lonely, I'm bored,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.498
and I miss my bae's touch!
- Okay.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.709
Not loving your touch right now,
but, uh, okay, fine.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.920
Yeah, I guess I could use the company.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.296
I'll go order us a pizza.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.131
Can Robert do that?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.259
Probably just make it,
since he's a super-talented chef.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.264
I mean, I hate that old dirtbag!

05:07.057 --> 05:08.475
Ooh.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.977
Oh!

05:10.727 --> 05:12.896
Hey, babe. How's Boca?
RACHEL [on phone]: <i>Don't know.</i>

05:12.896 --> 05:15.524
I flew home early.
My aunt's Florida friends were all,

05:15.524 --> 05:16.900
"Don't say gay." And I was like,

05:16.900 --> 05:19.611
"You know what? I'm gonna say it.
Gay! Bye!"

05:20.195 --> 05:22.447
Come over.
I haven't seen you in weeks,

05:22.447 --> 05:25.742
and there's some things
we couldn't do on FaceTime.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.453
I'm dying to do those things,
but I promised Jesse we'd hang.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.705
Maybe I can bail?

05:29.705 --> 05:31.582
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I'll get a sausage pie, please.

05:31.582 --> 05:34.543
Oh, a-and make it a large
'cause I'm hangin' with my sister.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.462
I can't bail.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.090
You're so lucky your brother's in prison.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.343
Oh, man. We are aging
so much faster than I thought!

05:43.343 --> 05:44.344
Oh, you're right.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.346
We look like
Grace and Frankie's grandfathers.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.391
The lighting in here is not helping!

05:49.391 --> 05:50.893
Siddhartha, do not blame the lighting!

05:51.643 --> 05:53.353
Two paths diverging into the woods.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
One leads to gorgeous Robert,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.649
and the other leads to that
cranky old man at the bar

05:57.649 --> 05:59.860
whose head looks like a scrotum.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.778
Dude, you're right.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.864
We gotta start taking
better care of ourselves right now.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.074
That's how you get to be a Robert.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.536
Just need to be calm about this.
Don't need to do anything drastic.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.706
Oh, absolutely. Calm. Non-drastic.

06:13.332 --> 06:15.292
We will do anything
to look young forever!

06:30.390 --> 06:33.644
Wowza. I am romantic as butt.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.523
Hey, Val!

06:37.523 --> 06:38.690
Hey!

06:38.690 --> 06:41.193
Wait, did you sign up for
Big Brother, Big Sister without me?

06:42.486 --> 06:45.489
What? This is the guy I told you about. Swish.

06:46.156 --> 06:46.990
Swish?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.742
Sup?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.620
We got kicked out of his dorm
for hustling a game of flip cup,

06:51.620 --> 06:55.582
and Swish lost his fake ID,
so he can't go to bars.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.709
Your guys' place is sick!

06:57.709 --> 07:00.087
My girl is hella aspirational.
- Aw...

07:01.088 --> 07:04.591
Um, Val? Can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a minute?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.593
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.264
How old is he?

07:10.264 --> 07:13.642

07:34.413 --> 07:36.915

07:43.630 --> 07:45.674
will just have to share
the apartment tonight.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.012
- Fine.
- Fine.

scientists gave up on climate change

10:40.015 --> 10:41.558
What is that supposed to mean?!
Nothing!

10:42.309 --> 10:45.187
I-I might have told her that you haven't
slept with anyone since Meredith.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.647
What? For all you know,

10:46.647 --> 10:48.440
I could've slept with dozens of women
since Meredith!

10:48.440 --> 10:50.275
No, Sid hasn't texted me.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.818
You and Sid text about my sex life.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.362
Not lately.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.905
How did this happen?!

10:54.905 --> 10:56.532
How did I become the guy
who has so little sex

10:56.532 --> 10:57.824
that people text about it?!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.076
I mean, I'm cool!

10:59.076 --> 11:01.787
I play the guitar!
I collect vintage T-shirts!

11:01.787 --> 11:05.749
Yes, 'cause you have a lot of
extra time from not having sex.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.628
Really glad we're finally getting to
spend some time together, Rachel.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.840
Jesse, yes, you're cool.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.717
But, you're also a softie
who's hung up on a hottie

11:15.717 --> 11:17.886
who's into an oldie.
And I hate to say it, bro,

11:17.886 --> 11:19.137
but you need to move on.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.848
Or, at the very least, take back the bed.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.225
You're right.
I need to take back the bed.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.561
I'm gonna go out right now
and find a woman to have sex with.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.064
In a very respectful way
where she also mutually

11:29.064 --> 11:30.607
wants to have sex with me.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.150
- Totally! Get back out there.
- Oh, yes!

11:32.150 --> 11:33.235
Leave now! We'll watch the place.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.195
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.446
You're coming with me, okay?

11:36.446 --> 11:39.157
Nothing is creepier
than a single straight white guy

11:39.157 --> 11:41.535
sitting alone at a bar,
trying to pick up women.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.328
Fine. Great.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.539
I can't get laid
until my brother gets laid.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.250
Love it. Very Mormon.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.545
So, Swish?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.547
What'd you learn at school today?

11:53.922 --> 11:56.133
Um, we've been studying
really old films.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.051
Uh, specifically from the late '90s.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.928
My thesis is on the <i>Scream</i> franchise.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.972
Ooh! I catered the New York premiere.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.600
David Arquette loved my hummus.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.144
Mad respect, sir.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.937
Is it true landlines
were invented for that movie?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.147
Oh, Robert.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.524
You do not have
to help Swish with his homework.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.859
Oh, I don't know.

12:13.859 --> 12:17.321
I think it might be nice for Swish
to learn from his <i>elders</i>.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.449
Isn't that what he's doing with you?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.452
Besides, Robert and I have important...

12:23.452 --> 12:24.870
grown-up things to talk about.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.123
You know what? Nothing makes
you sound more like a dumb baby

12:28.123 --> 12:30.083
than when you call something "grown-up."

12:30.083 --> 12:32.961
Oh, you should know a thing or two about
dumb babies 'cause you're dating one.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.298
We should just stay quiet, right?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.550
You're very smart for your age.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.517
This is our top-of-the-line
age simulator.

12:46.517 --> 12:50.145
I can show you exactly how you'll look
in 25 years if you do nothing.

12:52.856 --> 12:56.777
Oh, my face.
Oh, my beautiful face!

12:56.777 --> 12:58.195
Well, good luck to you, buddy.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.364
I guess some of us are just blessed
with good genes.

13:00.906 --> 13:01.907
You know what they say.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.451
"South Asian don't raisin."

13:04.451 --> 13:07.704
Oops. I-I forgot to hit play
on your simulation.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.585
I'm a raisin! I'm a raisin!

13:14.545 --> 13:16.380
Shoot us up with everything you've got.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.637
Jesse, I promise
you don't say "hello" weird.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.556
Just go talk to that cute girl.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.266
Are you sure?
It feels like it's coming out weird.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.142
Hello. Hallo. <i>Hallo?</i>

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
- Just go with hi!
- Hi!

13:32.312 --> 13:34.815
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! Hi.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.570
Wait, wait. C-can you do the sound
of the dial-up modem again?

13:39.570 --> 13:41.280
The modem goes like this.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.451
♪ beatboxing along ♪

13:48.203 --> 13:52.082
♪ harmonizing ♪

13:52.082 --> 13:54.001
Anyone need more wine?
I need wine.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.961
Hey, actually, I'm going to, uh,

13:55.961 --> 13:57.713
use the facility and get going.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.673
No. No no, don't get going.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.467
Valentina, can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a minute?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.429
<i>You guys are driving Robert out of here,</i>

14:05.429 --> 14:07.431
<i>and I know you're not
really that into Swish.</i>

14:07.431 --> 14:09.641
You're wrong. I like Swish.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.518
I <i>really</i> like Swish.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.437
In fact, I think I love Swish.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.984
If you swear to me
that you're serious about Swish,

14:18.984 --> 14:21.612
then I'll drop it <i>and</i> be happy for you.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.075
Fine.
I'm not serious about Swish.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.620
I was just mad that you made fun
of my relationship,

14:29.620 --> 14:31.788
and then tried to kick me
out of <i>our</i> apartment.

14:31.788 --> 14:32.789
Okay.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.791
And that was lame of me, alright?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.294
But, I-I was just nervous
about hosting Robert.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.421
We never have grown-ups here
that aren't our parents.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.423
Soph, you have to stop saying grown-ups.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.674
I know!

14:44.426 --> 14:46.678
Why are you hanging out with Swish
when you don't really like him?

14:46.678 --> 14:48.514
Oh, I like him fine.

14:48.514 --> 14:51.517
I mean, obviously,
I'll get bored and end it soon,

14:51.517 --> 14:52.976
but he's a lot of fun.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.229
And a <i>hell</i> of an ego boost.

14:55.229 --> 14:58.065
I do <i>any</i> basic adult things,
Swish is like,

14:58.065 --> 15:01.318
"Holy shit!" or, "Whoa!"
or, "You're amazing!"

15:02.945 --> 15:03.946
Oh no.

15:04.988 --> 15:05.989
Holy shit!

15:05.989 --> 15:07.032
Whoa!

15:07.032 --> 15:08.700
You're amazing.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.245
I'm Robert's Swish.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.208
What are you in the mood for?
Wine? Beer?

15:16.208 --> 15:17.209
I can make you a Manhattan

15:17.209 --> 15:20.128
if you promise not
to judge me for googling it.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.008
Please don't look at us!

15:25.008 --> 15:27.886
Just try to remember me as I was!

15:27.886 --> 15:29.763
What the hell happened to you two?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.099
<i>We got some preventative work done.</i>

15:32.099 --> 15:34.059
But I had an allergic reaction
to the Botox.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.812
My body is <i>literally</i> rejecting youth.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.649
I'm just a little bit raw
from the lasers.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.652
And the needling.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.612
And the chemical peel.

15:45.612 --> 15:49.157
Honestly, it is disgusting the hoops
we make men jump through.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.369
Anne, I'd like you
to meet Charlie and Sid.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.419
I really like your room.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.212
Thanks. I, uh,

16:02.212 --> 16:03.672
painted it myself.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.090
Ooh...

16:12.055 --> 16:14.349
Whose bra is this?

16:14.349 --> 16:15.559
D-do you have a girlfriend?

16:15.559 --> 16:17.644
No, no, no. H-honestly,
it's probably just my sister's.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.979
She was having sex in here earlier.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.274
Not with me. We don't do that.
She's adopted.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.151
Don't know why I said that. Uh...

16:26.361 --> 16:28.197
I'll call you a Lyft.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.198
Yeah.

16:31.575 --> 16:34.286
Soph! Relax.
You are not Robert's Swish.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.704
He really likes you.
- Yeah,

16:35.704 --> 16:37.623
he likes me for the <i>moment</i>

16:37.623 --> 16:40.709
because I'm young and fun
and easily impressed.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.212
Okay, but what happens
when the novelty wears off?

16:44.004 --> 16:46.965
It's gonna be like that time when
I decided to be a top hat person.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.884
Nope!

16:50.010 --> 16:52.888
Okay, if you're feeling
worried about it, then test it out.

16:52.888 --> 16:55.390
Try to make plans with Robert
for, like, a month from now.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.101
If he commits, you're golden.
If he doesn't...

16:59.061 --> 17:00.312
you're his Swish.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.564
Genius.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.690
Mm-hmm.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.110
<i>Swish and I will give you guys
some space...</i>

17:07.110 --> 17:09.196
I don't know where he went.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.156
Maybe he has a curfew?

17:11.156 --> 17:12.824
Hey. That was fun.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.159
Thank you for dinner.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.453
Oh, come on! No, it-it's still early.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.623
- No, I-I really gotta get home.
- Okay, but before you do, uh,

17:19.623 --> 17:23.377
the Fleet Foxes are playing
Webster Hall in a few weeks.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.378
We should go.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.004
Uh, call you tomorrow.
We'll talk all about it.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.172
Okay, but I have it right here.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.632
Hey, don't go rushing
into buying anything.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.259
No, no, no! Who's rushing?

17:32.010 --> 17:33.095
Just take a peep.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.223
Just send me the information,
and, you know, we'll figure it out.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.810
Oh! Maybe concerts aren't your thing,
but here is a list

17:39.810 --> 17:41.436
of upcoming events in the city.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.146
There's museums and flea markets...

17:43.146 --> 17:45.274
Politically incorrect puppet shows!

17:45.274 --> 17:46.400
Please let me go home!

17:47.234 --> 17:49.486
Our dates have kept me up late
for the last two weeks,

17:49.486 --> 17:50.904
and if I don't go home right now

17:50.904 --> 17:52.573
and get nine hours of sleep

17:52.573 --> 17:56.076
on my Tempur-Pedic mattress,
I-I'm gonna physically collapse.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.997
So, you're not avoiding
making plans with me

17:59.997 --> 18:03.208
because you don't wanna commit
to seeing me a month from now?

18:04.126 --> 18:05.335
What?

18:05.335 --> 18:07.212
No, I'm not making plans

18:07.212 --> 18:10.507
'cause I can't see your phone
without my reading glasses.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.509
But I didn't wanna tell you that

18:12.509 --> 18:14.720
or admit how tired I am

18:14.720 --> 18:16.930
because I don't want you
to feel like you're dating

18:16.930 --> 18:19.308
an <i>old</i> guy. Just an <i>older</i> guy.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.688
I'll tell you what.
How about next Saturday,

18:24.688 --> 18:28.066
or however far into the future
you want me to commit,

18:28.984 --> 18:31.361
we'll go to my place upstate.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.822
Whole weekend. Just me and you.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.284
I choose next Saturday.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.577
I was hoping you would.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.289
Val!

18:43.540 --> 18:44.708
V-Valentina?

18:44.708 --> 18:46.293
There you are!

18:47.753 --> 18:49.171
Look, uh,

18:49.171 --> 18:51.673
I-I know we've only been dating
for a few weeks, but...

18:52.883 --> 18:53.926
when you know, you know.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.014
I've never met anyone like you,

18:59.014 --> 19:00.974
and I love you, and...

19:00.974 --> 19:01.975
I know you love me, too.

19:02.893 --> 19:03.685
Will you marry me?

19:06.104 --> 19:07.523
- Yeah, okay.
- What?

19:07.523 --> 19:08.774
Ah!

19:08.774 --> 19:10.567
She said yes! You said yes!

19:10.567 --> 19:12.945
Oh, my gosh,
I gotta call my mom right now!

19:12.945 --> 19:15.239
Wrong room.
Oh! Sorry.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.659
Why would you say yes?

19:18.659 --> 19:20.202
<i>I didn't wanna be mean!</i>

19:21.078 --> 19:22.913
<i>Kids these days have,
like, zero attention span.</i>

19:22.913 --> 19:24.289
<i>He'll forget about it by tomorrow.</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:27.835
He wouldn't.
