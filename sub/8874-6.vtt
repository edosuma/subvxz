JACK: This. (TAPPING)

23:44.381 --> 23:46.600
What is this nail polish?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.515
You never wore nail polish.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.684
But you do now.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.436
AMY: Bix liked it.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.520
My parents were very strict,

23:57.686 --> 23:59.404
they didn't like me
to wear make-up,

23:59.396 --> 24:02.024
they hated
that jazz musician...

24:03.400 --> 24:05.027
But I didn't care.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.285
Bix loved it.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.419
So, that nail polish is me,

24:14.411 --> 24:15.537
Rose.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.424
I don't believe in Rose.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.217
Do you think it might be me?

24:28.217 --> 24:30.265
My strength? My sex?

24:30.719 --> 24:32.437
Maybe you love Rose?

24:34.431 --> 24:37.150
I don't believe in
this ridiculous shit,

24:37.142 --> 24:38.735
and I don't believe in Rose!

24:38.727 --> 24:40.070
Careful.

24:40.062 --> 24:40.779
Consider it.

24:40.771 --> 24:44.742
Isn't it possible that you'd
rather have Rose than Amy?

24:45.442 --> 24:46.443
Never.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.246
Except when we had fun.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.789
When we fought,

24:51.448 --> 24:54.452
and you could hurt me,
but not break me.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.500
When we had sex,

24:58.247 --> 25:00.750
and you were inside me,
and I was inside of Amy,

25:00.749 --> 25:04.595
and you gave me a pan of you that
you could never give to her.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.277
I saw you. I felt you.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.777
I felt my wife in that kiss.
I know you're there.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.369
I think that when Dylan died,

25:29.361 --> 25:30.487
you had a breakdown,

25:30.487 --> 25:31.534
depression.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.498
You disassociated
or something,

25:33.532 --> 25:34.499
and now you believe

25:34.533 --> 25:35.785
that you are all these
different people.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.582
I didn't want that pregnancy.
I fought it.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.706
That's why Amy had so much
trouble getting pregnant.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.503
Oh, no, no, no, the doctor
said it was because

25:41.498 --> 25:42.590
we were a little older.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.507
We tried so hard.
Fertility shots...

25:45.502 --> 25:46.503
We wanted that baby.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.847
We wanted that baby
more than anything!

25:48.839 --> 25:49.761
I didn't.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.510
And then these
crazy, twisted...

25:52.509 --> 25:55.228
Zealots preyed upon you,
and...

25:55.220 --> 25:58.520
And made you say
and do horrible things,

25:58.515 --> 26:00.609
-and made you believe...
-I killed that baby.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.527
(YELLS) That is a lie!

26:02.519 --> 26:03.520
(YELLS) I killed it!

26:03.520 --> 26:05.614
Because I don't want
to have a baby with you!

26:05.606 --> 26:07.529
I don't love you!

26:07.566 --> 26:09.534
I did it to make Amy go away,

26:09.526 --> 26:11.654

That I wasn't there
to save you.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.597
To protect our baby.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.723
I know you love me,
and I know...

27:21.682 --> 27:24.606
You loved our unborn child.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.856

27:31.400 --> 27:33.448
I will never let her go.

She's not here, it's just me.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.449
If it makes
you feel any better,

27:38.448 --> 27:41.247
she doesn't know that
I terminated the pregnancy.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.625
I don't believe
a word you say any more.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.711
You'll figure it out.
