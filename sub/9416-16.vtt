WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.125
Howdy, Duncans.

00:05.208 --> 00:06.166
- Hey.
- Hey, Beau.

00:06.250 --> 00:07.500
- Morning, sweetie.
- Hi.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.166
We got a big day ahead of us, little B.

00:10.542 --> 00:11.959
I'm looking forward to it, big B.

00:12.709 --> 00:13.875
Oh. Good.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.250
They have nicknames.

00:16.542 --> 00:18.250
Yeah, I guess we should get going.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.375
Taking down a hornet's nest today.

00:20.458 --> 00:21.625
Ooh.

00:21.709 --> 00:24.375
So that's the excitement
I feel in the air.

00:25.041 --> 00:27.250
Oh, hey. Got a surprise for you.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.583
I am gonna let you hold the fogger.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.500
Permission to hug you, sir.

00:32.083 --> 00:33.750
Oh, bring it in, little B.

00:36.041 --> 00:37.542
All right. We'll see you guys.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.166
- See you girls.
- See ya.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.125
I think your father really likes this one.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.375
I know.

00:43.458 --> 00:44.750
It concerns me.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.375
Well, I should probably get to school.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.125
All right. Have a good day, little T.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.709
You too, big A.

Emmett, we gotta pay our rent.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.417
Again?

01:54.250 --> 01:55.917
What is that, like every month now?

01:57.417 --> 01:59.542
- Yeah.
- But I don't have the money right now.

01:59.625 --> 02:01.875
Well, that is very irresponsible.

02:03.625 --> 02:04.917
Especially since I don't either.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.375
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

02:07.458 --> 02:08.959
But if we can't pay the rent
on this place,

02:09.041 --> 02:10.709
we're gonna have
to move back home with our parents.

02:10.792 --> 02:13.083
Well maybe you can,
but that's not an option for me.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.083
Why not?

02:14.458 --> 02:16.750
Well, my parents moved
and they won't tell me where.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.000
Well, what if you want to see them?

02:21.083 --> 02:22.458
Oh, we meet at a neutral location.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.041
But I have to leave first,
so that way, I can't follow them.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.959
Well, if we're having trouble
paying the rent,

02:29.041 --> 02:31.166
maybe we could, uh, get a roommate.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.000
You mean like somebody else
that would live here?

02:33.083 --> 02:34.375
That's what a roommate is, yes.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.500
Well, that's a great idea.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.667
That way, we'd each only have
to pay one third of the rent.

02:41.208 --> 02:42.792
Wait, did I do that math right?

02:44.709 --> 02:46.542
Like I'd know.

02:53.625 --> 02:54.834
Oh, watch out for that cyborg.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.041
I see him.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.417
Got him.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.667
You are ruthless. I love it.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.625
- I get it from my Grandma.
- I still love it.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.667
Hey, kids.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.125
Something wrong, Mrs. Duncan?

03:16.208 --> 03:17.667
Oh, here we go.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.583
Well, since you asked.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.667
See, I'm a local television personality.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.417
I appear on Good Morning Denver .

03:26.500 --> 03:28.208
And the flood gates are open.

03:30.208 --> 03:33.583
But they haven't had me on lately,
and it is really getting me down.

03:35.959 --> 03:37.166
Is it over for me?

03:37.959 --> 03:39.917
While I still have so much left to give?

03:42.542 --> 03:45.792
You know, that's a really good question.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.625
Maybe Dad knows the answer to that.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.625
Dad! Here comes Mom!

03:49.709 --> 03:50.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.792
It's all about the Green Grocer.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.000
He's the flavor of the month.

03:55.959 --> 03:59.375
I think he just got lucky with that
"eat a zucchini, wear a bikini" line.

04:00.834 --> 04:02.583
Oh, my Grandma saw that segment.

04:02.667 --> 04:03.959
And then she bought some zucchini.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.875
She's not thinking of...

04:06.959 --> 04:07.959
A bikini?

04:08.041 --> 04:09.166
Oh, I don't think so.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.417
Stay on top of that.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.875
I actually have a segment
coming on tomorrow.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.375
It's my first one in weeks.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.125
But will it be my last?

04:19.750 --> 04:22.458
Dad, these questions from Mom
are piling up!

04:24.250 --> 04:25.375
Oh, well.

04:25.667 --> 04:29.083
If it is my last, I guess the good news is
I get to spend more time with my kids.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.000
What's your segment about?

04:32.083 --> 04:33.208
Okay.

04:33.834 --> 04:38.417
It's about entertaining the little ones
and also getting your housework done.

04:38.500 --> 04:42.083
What I do, is I fold towels
into whimsical animal shapes.

04:46.583 --> 04:47.875
A lot of it is visual.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.041
- Here, want me to show you?
- Sure.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.458
Okay, great. I just made one.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.375
You'll love it.

04:54.792 --> 04:56.875
What is wrong with you?
I thought you said you were ruthless.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.250
With cyborgs.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.583
This is your Mom.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.875
What's the difference?

05:03.250 --> 05:04.375
Ba-bam!

05:04.458 --> 05:06.709
It's a swan!

05:09.750 --> 05:11.041
Do you want me to show you how?

05:11.125 --> 05:12.083
Come on, guys.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.625
I've got a basket full of towels
and nothing but time.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.458
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.792
Teddy, the most amazing thing
happened today.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.375
I saw my first camel cricket.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.917
You know, this kid is a natural.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.291
I thought it was a cave cricket.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.166
Wow.

05:34.208 --> 05:38.625
Well, I hope you turned to my Dad
and gave him a big old "in your face!"

05:40.792 --> 05:42.375
Yeah, we don't do that. We're a team.

05:42.875 --> 05:43.875
Oh.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.041
Well, unless we're getting attacked
by a skunk.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.959
Then you're on your own.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.375
A great exterminator
and a great sense of humor.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.083
Oh, stop.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.000
Beau, honey, you got the job.

05:58.083 --> 06:01.959
You can stop kissing up and start
making fun of him like the rest of us.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.250
What do you mean?

06:04.583 --> 06:06.792
It's just, you don't have to pretend

06:06.875 --> 06:09.917
to be fascinated
with all of this exterminator stuff.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.750
But I really am fascinated.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.458
I could see myself doing this as a career.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.208
Seriously? Um...

06:18.333 --> 06:20.834
Yeah. Today,
I was in the crawlspace, right?

06:20.917 --> 06:23.375
- And I found this big old spider--
- Beau. Beau.

06:24.208 --> 06:27.166
As my mom always says,
"What happens under the house

06:27.250 --> 06:29.041
stays under the house."

06:30.333 --> 06:31.417
All right.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.959
- Well, I'd better go.
- Okay.

06:33.834 --> 06:35.333
I need to get home and get showered.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.375
That stuff we were using today
is highly toxic.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.333
Could you have maybe told me that
before the hug?

06:41.458 --> 06:43.166
Yeah, you're probably gonna have
to shower too.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.041
Sorry, sweetie.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.375
Hey. Where's Beau?

06:52.458 --> 06:53.667
Oh, he just left.

06:53.750 --> 06:54.959
Without saying good-bye?

06:56.250 --> 06:58.542
Dad, you'll see him again tomorrow.

06:59.166 --> 07:02.458
In some disgusting little enclosure.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.166
I'm telling you.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.083
That Beau is a great kid.

07:07.166 --> 07:09.041
And who knows. You two stick together,

07:09.125 --> 07:11.583
I could see passing the business
down to him some day.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.542
Dad, we haven't been dating for that long.

07:14.625 --> 07:15.875
I know. It's just...

07:16.750 --> 07:19.125
Ooh, this one feels special.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.166
So I have an engineering degree.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.917
Now I'm working on my masters
in astrophysics.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.583
Well, that's all well and good, Brian,

07:33.667 --> 07:35.625
but we have a pretty strict
screening process here.

07:35.709 --> 07:38.083
So, let me ask you the big question.

07:39.875 --> 07:43.583
Do you have 167 dollars?

07:46.667 --> 07:47.792
Yes.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.417
Okay. Follow-up question.

07:50.041 --> 07:54.542
Will you have 167 dollars
this time next month?

07:55.375 --> 07:56.375
Yes.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.917
- I think we have all we need.
- Mm-hm.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.041
I'm neat, I'm quiet.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.750
And how do you feel about roommates
who are neither neat nor quiet?

08:06.166 --> 08:07.000
That's fine.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.333
I just need a place to live.

08:08.917 --> 08:11.750
And did we ask you
about the 167 dollars already?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.250
A few times, yes.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.959
Okay, Andy. Thanks for coming over.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.208
- We'll get back to you real soon.
- Great.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.250
Well, seems to me the choice is obvious.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.083
- I'd say it's a no-brainer.
- I agree.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.375
- Good job, roomie.
- All right.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.125
It's gonna be nice having a new roommate.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.458
One more guy to help with chores.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.166
- One more guy to help with shopping.
- And the best part is...

08:32.750 --> 08:34.083
We can finally realize our dream.

08:35.083 --> 08:36.417
Both: The human pyramid.

08:42.959 --> 08:44.375
Okay, how does this sound?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.083
"Dear station manager,

08:46.625 --> 08:50.667
Mama Bird's recent segment
on towel animals was towel-rific".

08:51.709 --> 08:53.208
What are you doing?

08:53.291 --> 08:55.125
We're writing letters
to Good Morning Denver

08:55.208 --> 08:58.709
so they'll keep mommy on TV,
and most importantly, away from us.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.375
What's a letter?

09:01.834 --> 09:05.208
It's an expensive way
to slowly send an e-mail.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.959
Okay. We have 10 letters.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.500
Okay. Let's get these things in the mail

09:12.583 --> 09:14.917
so they'll arrive
the day after Mom's story airs.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.333
Amy: Charlie, I'm ready to play dress-up.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.542
Coming.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.875
This better work.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.166
Oh. Beau Jr.

09:37.625 --> 09:40.709
You eat just like grandpa Bob.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.959
And you have just as many teeth. Yeah.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.542
- Hey, darling.
- Hi, honey.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.125
And baby boy.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.792
You know, there's nothing I'd rather see
after a long day of killing bugs

09:56.875 --> 09:58.792
than my beautiful bride.

09:59.417 --> 10:00.583
Oh, you're cooking.

10:01.625 --> 10:02.583
Yeah.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.375
Isn't it funny how life turned out?

10:04.458 --> 10:07.500
I cook like my Mom,
and you work like my Dad.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.125
But other than that,
me and him are pretty different.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.125
You lose more hair today?

10:16.959 --> 10:18.083
Yeah.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.959
But more came in on my back.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.834
Oh. That's nice.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.750
You won't believe
what happened at work today.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.375
Is this gonna be a bug story?

10:27.458 --> 10:28.709
Yeah, it starts out as one,

10:28.792 --> 10:30.375
but then a feral cat comes into it.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.083
I'm getting ahead of myself.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.333
Oh, honey, take your time.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.709
I'm not going anywhere.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.333
Ever.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.917
There I was in the Johnson's crawlspace.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.834
Ordinary Tuesday.

10:44.834 --> 10:46.291
Or so I thought.

10:47.959 --> 10:48.875
Yeah.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.667
Until I saw the sawdust.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.542
That always means termites.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.709
Beau: Well, almost always.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.792
Man, I don't think the place
has ever been this clean before.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.417
Yeah, that was a rough 15 minutes.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.583
Ah.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.709
That must be our new roommate.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.417
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.375
Uh, what's Andy doing here?

11:21.458 --> 11:23.458
- He's our new roommate.
- No, he's not.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.500
- Brian's our new roommate.
- Hey.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.709
I don't think so.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.542
Guys, come on in.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.709
Uh, we're gonna have a quick discussion
out in the hallway.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.417
- Not about you.
- Oh.

11:36.542 --> 11:37.709
A little about you.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.417
I thought you said this was a no-brainer.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.625
Yeah, to pick the short guy.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.500
He's the perfect top for the pyramid.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.166
The pyramid will be higher
with the tall guy.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.083
Maybe we shouldn't have based everything
on the pyramid.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.125
I can't believe this is the first time
I've been on TV in weeks.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.542
It's not right, Mom.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.000
It's just not right.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.500
Okay. Here we go.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.500
Rhonda: Good Morning, Denver.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.000
And good morning, Phil.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.417
Phil: It's always a good morning
when I'm with you, Rhonda.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.208
I've got to say, I like Phil and Rhonda.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.500
Behind the scenes,
those two can't stand each other.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.959
- No!
- Yes.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.125
Gabe, Phil and Rhonda used to be a couple.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.458
That is until Rhonda decided to give
the Green Grocer a squeeze.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.625
Phil: We're getting word now
of some breaking news.

12:34.041 --> 12:36.583
Let's go live to I-70,
where our news chopper

12:36.667 --> 12:39.250
is following a high speed police pursuit.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.875
What?

12:40.959 --> 12:42.542
No, we want to see Mom!

12:42.625 --> 12:43.625
Gabe.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.041
Honey, relax.

12:45.417 --> 12:46.959
It's okay. I'm on towards the end.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.959
As long as this doesn't go on too long,
we'll be fine.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Phil: This is now becoming one of the
longest car chases in Denver history.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.917
Oh. This is bad.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.250
This is really, really bad.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.542
What's wrong?

13:00.625 --> 13:02.792
Well, tomorrow. the station's gonna get
a bunch of letters

13:02.875 --> 13:06.000
saying how much they loved Mom's story
which isn't on.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.750
This is bad.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.709
This is really bad.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.625
- Oh, is this chase still on?
- Yes.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.583
Somebody!
Pull him over, flatten his tires!

13:18.667 --> 13:20.250
We want to see towel animals!

13:21.417 --> 13:23.750
Gabe, honey, it's okay.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.375
We'll get through this.

13:25.458 --> 13:28.250
Hey, if they don't put my segment
on today, they'll put it on another day.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.125
No, it has to be today.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.834
Phil: Looks like he's pulling over,
and he's putting his hands up.

13:33.917 --> 13:36.208
Guess this chase has come
to a peaceful ending.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.375
Yes. Finally.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.083
Rhonda: Well, we have time
for one more segment.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.417
And we saved the best for last.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.875
So let's hear from everybody's favorite,
the Green Grocer.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.500
Both: Oh, come on!

13:55.458 --> 13:57.792
- Hey, darling.
- Hey.

13:58.375 --> 14:02.125
- How are you?
- Uh, I'm okay, I guess.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.125
I had this crazy dream.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.583
It was the future,
and we were living here.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.333
You inherited my Dad's business,
and you...

14:09.041 --> 14:11.625
You were telling these crazy bug stories.

14:11.709 --> 14:14.458
That's funny.

14:14.542 --> 14:16.083
And you were bald.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.166
That's not funny.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.166
Listen, can we sit?

14:24.250 --> 14:25.917
I got something
I need to talk to you about.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah.

14:30.542 --> 14:31.834
What's going on?

14:32.750 --> 14:35.250
Ralph Hughes died.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.542
Oh, no.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.667
Who's Ralph Hughes?

14:40.792 --> 14:41.875
I don't know.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.542
Well, I'm really glad
we sat down for this.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.250
No, I mean I just never met him.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.250
He was the exterminator
back home in Hollow Rock.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.667
Which means there's a job opening
for an exterminator...

14:58.583 --> 14:59.875
and it's mine if I want it.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.417
Oh.

15:02.709 --> 15:03.875
My Grandma called.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.083
She said if I take this job and come home,

15:06.166 --> 15:07.792
she'll pay for me
to go to college at night.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.917
So, what are you saying?
Are you going back to Tennessee?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.375
I don't know how I can turn this down.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.667
Look, I didn't want
to say anything, but...

15:24.583 --> 15:26.208
I've been real homesick.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.959
I like working
for your dad and all, but...

15:32.959 --> 15:36.375
Teddy, the only thing that would keep me
in Denver is you.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.959
Look, Beau...

15:42.542 --> 15:45.750
I mean, I don't want you to go.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.083
But I'm not gonna stand in your way.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.709
So, this is good-bye?

15:58.250 --> 15:59.583
Yeah, I guess so.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.375
You're a special girl, Teddy.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.208
I'm gonna miss you a ton.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.458
I'm gonna miss you too.

16:18.667 --> 16:19.625
Hey, guys.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.333
Why the sad faces?

16:22.750 --> 16:24.375
Now comes the hard part.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.542
Rotate.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.000
Brian, you heard the ding.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.333
After the ding, we rotate.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.542
I'm not done eating yet.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.959
I don't care. Take it to the bathroom.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.291
That's not sanitary.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.583
And the system works.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.250
Hey PJ, you mind trading me
some bathroom time for some chair time?

16:52.333 --> 16:55.125
The system is ding, move, ding, move.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.500
There are no tack-ons.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.709
- Andy?
- Don't even look at me.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.917
Rotate.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.375
- Emmett, bathroom.
- Why?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.500
I'm clean, I'm brushed,
and I don't have to go.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.166
Not my problem. We have a system.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.542
The system's stupid.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.500
I've seen the beginnings of three shows.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.041
I don't know how any of them end.

17:16.583 --> 17:19.125
Who's squeezing the toothpaste tube
from the middle?

17:19.208 --> 17:21.959
I wasted half my bathroom time
trying to fix this.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.375
PJ, can I talk to you
in the hallway please?

17:27.375 --> 17:28.250
Sure.

17:28.375 --> 17:32.083
You guys keep moving on the dings, okay?
We'll catch up.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.583
Rotate.

17:35.792 --> 17:38.000
- This isn't working.
- Yeah, you're right.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.417
We have to get rid of somebody.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.166
- I pick Brian.
- I pick Andy.

17:41.709 --> 17:42.750
Re-vote.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.041
- Brian.
- Andy.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.041
- Re-vote.
- No, man.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.375
As I see it, there's only one possible way
to solve this.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.250
We're out of here.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.959
- Yeah. We're getting our own place.
- Whoa.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.375
Well, two ways.

18:00.792 --> 18:03.083
I know it's hard right now...

18:03.166 --> 18:06.917
but there will be other exterminators.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.083
No.

18:09.166 --> 18:10.500
Not like Beau.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.667
He was.... yeah, he was special.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.583
- You'll be okay, I promise.
- Oh.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.792
You don't understand.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.417
Nobody understands.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.125
I thought he was the one.

18:30.625 --> 18:34.083
Well, this doesn't have
to be good-bye forever.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.500
You could video chat.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.291
I don't know how to do that.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.375
I'll teach you.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
You will?

18:48.125 --> 18:50.333
Of course I will.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.250
Come here.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.208
Come here.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.083
Why?

19:09.250 --> 19:10.625
I want to give you a hug.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.083
I'm gonna need more information.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.500
Gabe, I just got off the phone
with the station manager.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.417
Yeah, they received
a whole bunch of letters

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
about my segment that never aired.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.166
And I know you wrote them.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.083
You do?

19:31.166 --> 19:33.000
Two things tipped me off.

19:33.083 --> 19:36.375
One, you were acting really weird
when you were watching the show.

19:36.792 --> 19:39.542
And two, you were watching the show.

19:42.834 --> 19:45.458
- And you're not mad?
- No, honey.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.125
Just the opposite. I...

19:47.959 --> 19:51.625
I can't believe you would go to all that
trouble to help your mommy's TV career.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.625
That's exactly why I did it.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.291
In fact, the station manager
was so impressed,

19:59.375 --> 20:01.875
he wants me to do a segment
on our relationship.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.917
He... he wants what now?

20:06.750 --> 20:08.709
It'll be all about how close we are.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.750
I'm gonna call it "My baby Gabey".

20:14.917 --> 20:16.500
And we're gonna wear matching outfits.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.834
Are you for real, Mom?

20:20.917 --> 20:22.709
Or are you just like, messing with me
or something?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.667
Why would I mess with my baby Gabey?

20:28.041 --> 20:30.291
Because the real reason
you wrote the letters

20:30.375 --> 20:32.625
was to get me out of the housey wousey?

20:35.458 --> 20:38.041
- Charlie told you?
- She sang like a birdy wordy.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.792
Well, Charlie, Beau moved back
to Tennessee.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.750
And even though he's only been gone
a few days,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.291
I already miss him.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.709
Of course, not as much as Dad does.

20:55.750 --> 20:59.041
Wow! A nest full of yellow jackets?

20:59.125 --> 21:02.583
Whoa! Good kill, little B.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.750
Beau: Yeah, well, I learned from the best.

21:05.834 --> 21:07.458
Uh, is Teddy around?

21:07.875 --> 21:09.208
Uh, nope.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.792
No, not home yet.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.542
Um, hey, listen.

21:13.709 --> 21:16.000
Let me tell you about
this black widow spider I saw today.

21:16.083 --> 21:20.458
She had an egg sack on her
the size of a softball.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.333
Ugh.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.875
I guess my advice to you, would be...

21:27.542 --> 21:30.625
date a guy who's afraid of bugs,
because if not...

21:30.917 --> 21:34.000
Well, good luck, Charlie.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.250
What are you supposed to be?

21:41.458 --> 21:43.792
A towel lobster, obviously.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.333
Huh! I'm not getting that.

21:46.417 --> 21:47.667
Crab, maybe.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.041
Well, what are you supposed to be?

21:51.125 --> 21:53.834
I'm obviously a towel elephant.

21:53.917 --> 21:55.291
And a pretty good one.

21:56.625 --> 22:00.125
Really? I'm getting more anteater.

22:01.959 --> 22:03.625
Could you guys keep it down?

22:03.709 --> 22:05.542
Who are you supposed to be?

22:05.625 --> 22:06.875
A towel.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.375
And proud of it.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.583
I don't need all the bells and whistles.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.875
Hear that, kids?
It's okay to just be who you are.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.333
How do you like who you are now?
