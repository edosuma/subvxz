<i>There he is!
Boy 2". Shh!</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:53.929
Boy 1; On, sorry.

00:54.096 --> 00:57.599
<i>Superman, superman,
can we ask you some questions?</i>

00:57.766 --> 00:59.017
<i>Boy 1". It's for our podcast.</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:00.185
<i>Well, in that case...</i>

01:00.352 --> 01:03.105
<i>- How many people have you saved?
- I...</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:05.566
<i>Never mind. Does your thing
really stand for hope?</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:06.817
<i>Yes. It does.</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:08.318
<i>But it looks like an </i>

01:08.485 --> 01:09.820
<i>yes. It's meant to. It's...</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:13.156
<i>It's meant to wind like a river.</i>

01:13.323 --> 01:15.158
<i>It comes and goes. My...</i>

01:17.286 --> 01:20.414
<i>A man I knew used to say
hope is like your car keys.</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:24.126
<i>Easy to lose, but if you dig around,
it's usually close by.</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:26.086
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:27.254
<i>No. Shh! That's dumb.</i>

01:27.421 --> 01:29.214
<i>But hippos are the most deadly.</i>

01:29.298 --> 01:31.216
<i>Uh... what is, uh...</i>

01:31.300 --> 01:33.218
<i>What's the best thing
about planet earth?</i>

01:33.302 --> 01:34.344
<i>Hmm...</i>

03:02.474 --> 03:03.975
What are you doing?

03:04.226 --> 03:07.354
Wait. No, wait. Wait. Wait!

03:07.938 --> 03:09.731
Please! Please, man. Please!

03:13.819 --> 03:15.404
What do you want from me?

03:15.570 --> 03:16.905
Feat

03:17.447 --> 03:19.616
they can smell it.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.720
What the hell?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.147
What was that?

04:32.314 --> 04:33.523
A scout.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.817
From space?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.652
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:39.404
<i>Batman". Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:42.324
I am.
Matches the other sightings.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.453
And that pattern is all over
Luthor's notes.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.163
Prep the jet. We're going north tonight.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.583
Good. It's time then.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.004
It's 'cause they know
he's dead, right?

04:56.588 --> 04:57.839
Superman.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.550
He's gone.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.303
<i>Where does that leave us?</i>

08:03.066 --> 08:04.192
Drop your guns now!

08:07.237 --> 08:08.405
Excuse me.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.702
Gunmani go!

08:17.914 --> 08:19.916
Move it! Move! Move!

08:23.420 --> 08:24.462
Get down!

08:25.547 --> 08:27.507
Line them up along the wall!

08:27.674 --> 08:28.842
Keep them quiet!

08:32.761 --> 08:34.347
<i>Woman". Children, stay close to me.</i>

09:01.041 --> 09:02.625
Who are you?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.545
The lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.839
Now, who are you?

09:08.590 --> 09:11.426
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.553
We know that sin has brought on
this plague of aliens.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.346
Why the hostages?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.766
You're too late.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.976
The countdown's already begun.

09:20.143 --> 09:24.105
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

09:24.647 --> 09:27.275
<i>While the world watches.</i>

09:29.486 --> 09:30.653
<i>Gunman'. Hush!</i>

09:30.779 --> 09:31.780
Shut up!

09:31.946 --> 09:33.740
This is man's best hope.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.825
Down with the modern world.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.244
Back to the dark ages

09:38.453 --> 09:41.164
and the safety of holy fear.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.084
Quiet!

10:22.413 --> 10:23.915
This would've been over quickly, but...

10:25.291 --> 10:27.377
No! Don't!

10:48.940 --> 10:49.941
I don't believe it.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.442
<i>What are you?</i>

10:51.609 --> 10:52.944
A believer.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.858
<i>Bruce". I'm asking for your help.</i>

11:32.984 --> 11:37.447
I believe there is a stranger
who comes to this village from the sea.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.866
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.784
Brings fish.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.704
<i>He comes on the king tide.</i>

11:46.122 --> 11:47.373
That was last night.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.590
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.719
Well, this stranger doesn't come
by ship.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.807
There are enemies coming from far away.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.769
I need warriors.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.439
<i>L'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.</i>

12:12.148 --> 12:15.360
Look, I'll give you 25,000
to talk to this man right now.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.736
<i>Outside.</i>

12:39.425 --> 12:41.678
Tell me what those three boxes are
and I'll make it 30.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.100
You should get out.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.810
Can you at least point me to Atlantis?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.022
Arthur curry.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.240
Also known as protector of the oceans.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.284
The aquaman.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.288
I hear you can talk to fish.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.458
So let me get this straight.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.170
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

13:16.337 --> 13:18.214
It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.174
Oh, that shithole.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.176
When the fight comes, we'll need you.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.886
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

13:24.095 --> 13:25.263
'Cause I don't like you coming here,

13:25.430 --> 13:27.223
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.518
People from Atlantis tell me, "do this."
Now you say, "do that."

13:30.685 --> 13:31.769
I wanna be left alone.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.147
Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

13:34.355 --> 13:35.648
'Cause you can just leave?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.984
I help them 'cause no one else does.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.903
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.990
"Strong man is strongest alone."
You ever heard that?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.491
That's not a saying.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.243
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.619
Yeah...

13:49.662 --> 13:51.622
<i>Doesn't mean I'm wrong.</i>

13:51.789 --> 13:53.458
You ever hear of superman?

13:53.624 --> 13:55.335
He died fighting next to me.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.919
My point exactly.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.631
What's in the three boxes?

14:01.215 --> 14:02.592
It's ancient history.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.801
What is it?

14:03.885 --> 14:06.596
Mankind's melting the polar ice caps,
destroying the ecosystem.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.889
They got it coming?

14:08.056 --> 14:11.434
Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.269
How about if they boil?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.355
Dressed like a bat.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.066
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.866
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

14:33.956 --> 14:38.336
So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this aquaman?

14:38.503 --> 14:40.630
Oh, I put a tracking device
in his coat,

14:40.713 --> 14:41.798
but he left without it.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.593
May, in fact, not have been his coat.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.972
Those squares from Luthor's notes.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.266
I think they must be containers
of some kind.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.476
Of what?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.895
I don't know. Money. Power.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.606
<i>- Something worth starting a war over.
- Hmm.</i>

14:59.190 --> 15:03.069
Well, we've had luck with one person
on the team list.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.239
<i>Barry Allen of central city.</i>

15:06.739 --> 15:08.366
He's completely off the grid.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.702
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.079
Disappearing act.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.206
<i>But he does visit his father.</i>

15:15.957 --> 15:18.501
In prison for murdering his mother.

15:18.709 --> 15:19.710
Jesus.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.255
<i>Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence.</i>

15:22.422 --> 15:24.841
<i>But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.</i>

15:24.924 --> 15:26.092
We have somebody at the prison?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.177
<i>Oh, yeah. We'll find the address.</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:31.681
What about, uh, Diana?

15:31.848 --> 15:33.224
Well, you have her number.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.393
What, you could've called her.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.856
Oh. Perhaps I should fly to Paris
with a handwritten note.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.526
"Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no."

15:43.693 --> 15:45.361
I'm only interested in her skillset.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.988
I'm sure you are.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.448
Can we?

15:48.656 --> 15:51.868
Uh, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.995
<i>But they've got a partial match.</i>

15:54.162 --> 15:55.830
<i>A Victor stone.</i>

15:55.997 --> 15:57.081
<i>Genius IQ,</i>

15:57.248 --> 16:01.169
football scholarship to gcu
and deceased.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.005
Figures. Fairy tales and ghost stories.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.381
One misses the days

16:05.465 --> 16:09.177
when one's biggest concerns
were exploding wind-up penguins.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.845
The simple life.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.891
I don't recognize this world.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.851
I don't have to recognize it.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.480
I just have to save it.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.112
Here to see Henry Allen.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.031
Sign.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.078
Hurry it up, will you?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.833
What, you got a problem?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.336
No, there's no problem.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.047
Better not be.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.844
You know where to go.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.773
Are those prescription?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.733
Or are you just trying to look brainy?

17:09.904 --> 17:11.864
Because you're
holding yourself back.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.115
You're going in circles.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.701
You're working three dead-end jobs,
going on four.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.161
Where do you even have the time?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.329
I make the time.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.123
And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.708
Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.794
The investigation was botched.

17:24.961 --> 17:25.962
Give me your hand, man.

17:32.468 --> 17:36.430
I want you to listen to me, Barry,
because I mean this.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.475
I want you to give all that up.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.314
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.778
Lam a drag on your life.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.449
Please don't ever say that to me again.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.701
Please?

17:56.867 --> 17:59.412
You can be whatever you want to be.
You're brilliant, man.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.041
Absolute best of the best.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.295
I can't sit here

18:07.461 --> 18:10.089
and watch you run in place
in central city

18:10.256 --> 18:15.052
for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.638
- Dad, that's not true. That's not true.
- It's time.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.307
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

18:19.473 --> 18:20.975
I want you to make your own future.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.060
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.563
<i>- Open gate.</i>

18:48.252 --> 18:49.962
Lab's all yours, Howard.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.923
11:30. Early night for you, Silas.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.843
Yes. Early.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.387
I never got to say...

19:00.348 --> 19:02.600
I'm very sorry about what happened.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.478
Victor was a wonderful kid.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.606
Thank you.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.327
<i>Victor.</i>

19:22.662 --> 19:24.413
Victor, you're not stuck up here.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.086
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

19:32.922 --> 19:34.340
If you stay up here brooding--

19:34.423 --> 19:35.424
<i>I'm processing.</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:38.094
I can access everything.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.929
But I can't put it all together.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.974
Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

19:44.183 --> 19:47.311
So you'd do to someone else
what you did to me.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.479
No.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.731
The box stays hidden.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.734
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

19:53.901 --> 19:56.612
I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

19:56.779 --> 19:57.822
get it powered up and--

19:57.988 --> 19:59.115
<i>does anybody know?</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:00.199
What?

20:00.366 --> 20:01.951
Victor; At the lab.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.202
Does anybody know I'm alive?

20:03.786 --> 20:05.496
Uh...

20:06.580 --> 20:08.290
- I didn't think you were ready for--
- to <i>what?</i>

20:08.999 --> 20:10.626
For them to see the monster?

20:11.335 --> 20:13.754
You are not a monster.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.632
It's weird that you thought I meant me.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.262
What I did...

20:23.848 --> 20:25.558
I lost your mother in that accident.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.476
<i>I wasn't about to...</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:31.272
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.065
But you did.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.319
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.197
It's not just digital. It's alien.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.201
Every day, I wake up different.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.455
Modified.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.707
<i>How do you...</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:58.007
Couldn't do that last night.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.260
<i>Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton</i>

21:01.427 --> 21:04.096
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.476
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.220
Any changes today?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.930
No, my queen.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.977
The mother box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

22:33.143 --> 22:37.398
It has slept for thousands of years
since the first age.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.149
Why did it wake at all?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.869
Amazons! On your mark!

22:57.293 --> 22:59.795
<i>Yes, soldiers! Fight on!</i>

23:00.004 --> 23:01.338
<i>Ready!</i>

23:14.184 --> 23:15.436
Steppenwolf.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.149
Steppenwolfi mother.

23:20.316 --> 23:24.278
Millennia in exile, searching...

23:24.445 --> 23:28.032
At last you call me home.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.159
You will not
like your welcome.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.162
Oh, I think I will.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.251
<i>Steady!</i>

23:42.796 --> 23:43.797
Forward!

23:56.310 --> 23:57.436
Gather the legions!

23:57.645 --> 23:59.021
You must seal the cage!

23:59.188 --> 24:00.981
Go!

24:01.190 --> 24:02.691
Philippusi flank right!

24:08.697 --> 24:09.740
Yes.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.533
Run.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.868
Seal the gates!

24:35.808 --> 24:37.142
Keep it moving.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.125
Got it! Go!

25:52.968 --> 25:54.303
Steppenwolfi enough.

26:02.436 --> 26:05.773
Noble queen, why do you fight?

26:06.482 --> 26:10.694
After the unity,
you will join my legion

26:10.903 --> 26:14.239
and you will know the righteousness
of power.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.205
You will love me.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.965
You all will.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.076
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

26:59.827 --> 27:03.080
The fire has not burned for 5,000 years.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.873
Men won't know what it means.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.417
Men won't.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.629
She will.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.768
Listen to me, Diana.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.541
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

27:47.708 --> 27:49.334
- Me?
- Yeah.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.378
Nothing very interesting.

27:51.461 --> 27:54.381
That's all you ever tell us.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.717
What can I say, I'm not that exciting.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.011
<i>...so-called shrine of the Amazons,</i>

27:59.178 --> 28:02.890
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me</i>

28:03.056 --> 28:07.561
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from locals
to government authorities alike.</i>

28:08.228 --> 28:10.731
<i>The fire could be seen for miles on end.</i>

28:10.898 --> 28:12.608
Invasion.

28:13.609 --> 28:17.196
<i>On the local scene this janitor's wife
had some strong words</i>

28:17.279 --> 28:20.908
<i>for the aliens she says stole her man.</i>

28:21.116 --> 28:24.745
<i>My Howard is a good man.
He's a provider.</i>

28:25.829 --> 28:28.290
<i>And these aliens are gonna
f****** probe him?</i>

28:29.291 --> 28:30.667
<i>Come down to the lakeview</i>

28:30.834 --> 28:34.338
<i>and I'll stick a f****** probe
up your alien a**. You...</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:37.549
<i>Martha". I found a little place.
By the diner.</i>

28:37.716 --> 28:39.176
<i>Suits me just fine.</i>

28:39.343 --> 28:40.802
I wish you'd said something.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.096
<i>Oh, no.
I got behind in the payments.</i>

28:43.263 --> 28:47.559
And you know the banks jump like
a cougar if you miss by a dime.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.811
Place was too big for me, anyway.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.980
Shuffling around like an old ghost.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.983
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

28:55.192 --> 28:58.820
You had enough to deal with. Don't need
to add "mother-in-law" to the list.

28:59.863 --> 29:00.864
Not that I was ever...

29:01.073 --> 29:02.574
<i>Garret". Hey, Lane.</i>

29:02.741 --> 29:07.162
Who was your source, um,
the activist in that university?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.081
Well, it's my source.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.833
<i>I got tapped for the kidnapping story.</i>

29:12.084 --> 29:15.254
There were all those student protests.
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.297
<i>So, who's your guy?</i>

29:17.464 --> 29:19.424
Well, I'll see if she'll take your call.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.177
So it's a she. Hmm.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.847
It's not a she.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.184
Sounds like you should be working
that story.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.103
I'm...

29:32.354 --> 29:33.939
I'm not ready yet.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.566
I'm perfectly happy doing fluff pieces

29:36.650 --> 29:38.527
about kitten grooming.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.237
For a while.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.324
It was, uh,
hard coming back here at all.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.370
Well, I can hardly read the news,
anyway.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.247
So much bitterness.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.375
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.004
But I suppose a mother does.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.842
But it's not like there's any less
that needs reporting.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.761
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another pulitzer.

30:04.928 --> 30:05.929
Oh, did he?

30:06.096 --> 30:07.264
Oh, yes. He did.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.726
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.104
Hungriest.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.857
Yeah.

30:17.816 --> 30:22.237
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

30:24.448 --> 30:28.160
Well, stories just made sense.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.122
It was more than just a puzzle.
It was about the truth.

30:32.789 --> 30:37.127
It was about seeing the engine
of the world.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.629
When it still ran.

30:47.179 --> 30:51.099
<i>Alfred". Victor stone. Deceased.</i>

31:32.766 --> 31:33.809
<i>That one.</i>

31:34.768 --> 31:36.937
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.147
<i>I'll see about rigging something
for the suit.</i>

31:39.314 --> 31:40.399
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

31:40.565 --> 31:42.317
Anything that can give me an edge.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.416
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.127
Yeah, it looked expensive.

32:03.755 --> 32:04.798
Hi.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.426
A new toy?

32:07.676 --> 32:09.469
Prototype troop carrier.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.640
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

32:13.807 --> 32:14.975
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:15.142 --> 32:17.853
<i>We're gonna need more than a pilot.</i>

32:18.478 --> 32:19.896
I think there's an attack coming.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.398
<i>Not coming, Bruce.</i>

32:22.107 --> 32:24.109
It's already here.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.824
<i>They called him steppenwolf,
the end of worlds.</i>

32:31.908 --> 32:34.953
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

32:35.537 --> 32:37.247
<i>Millions fell before his blade,</i>

32:38.123 --> 32:41.751
<i>- or rose again as his parademons.</i>

32:41.835 --> 32:44.379
<i>Nightmare creatures who feed on fear.</i>

32:46.256 --> 32:47.632
Yeah, I think I met one.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.217
We didn't hit it off.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.385
Here in Gotham?

32:50.594 --> 32:54.639
They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.141
The mother boxes.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.601
Mother boxes.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.603
I guess steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.396
That leaves two more.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.689
I'm impressed.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.858
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.860
A weapon? Some kind of power?

33:07.027 --> 33:08.945
They don't contain power.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.407
They are power.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.660
<i>Carried from planet to planet,</i>

33:15.827 --> 33:18.955
<i>the mother boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

33:19.122 --> 33:22.751
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

33:22.918 --> 33:26.129
<i>but transforms them
into the primordial hellscape</i>

33:26.296 --> 33:28.173
<i>of steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

33:30.050 --> 33:31.593
<i>We should have died.</i>

33:31.760 --> 33:33.970
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

33:34.554 --> 33:37.098
<i>Amazons, atlanteans,</i>

33:37.307 --> 33:41.061
<i>all the tribes of men
fought side by side.</i>

33:43.396 --> 33:44.439
<i>Warriors of legend,</i>

33:48.652 --> 33:50.529
<i>allies from other worlds,</i>

33:52.364 --> 33:55.492
<i>even the gods themselves
all acted as one.</i>

33:56.326 --> 33:59.371
<i>Laying down their lives
to drive steppenwolf away.</i>

34:11.466 --> 34:13.592
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

34:13.760 --> 34:16.429
<i>The disgrace of his first retreat.</i>

34:16.596 --> 34:19.181
<i>He swore our alliance would crumble.</i>

34:20.433 --> 34:22.143
<i>That darkness would cover the earth.</i>

34:25.480 --> 34:28.692
<i>And that he would return when it did.</i>

34:32.529 --> 34:33.737
<i>Left behind,</i>

34:33.905 --> 34:37.158
<i>the mother boxes were too dangerous
to be kept together.</i>

34:39.661 --> 34:42.496
<i>One was entrusted to the Amazons.</i>

34:43.373 --> 34:45.041
<i>One to the atlanteans.</i>

34:45.667 --> 34:49.963
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

34:50.755 --> 34:54.259
<i>The box of men was buried in secret</i>

34:54.801 --> 34:59.055
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

35:02.767 --> 35:05.812
Such Harmony out of such horror.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.315
It was truly an age of heroes.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.901
Something tells me we're not getting
the band back together.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.154
The atlanteans were forced undersea,

35:14.321 --> 35:16.990
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.285
Well, I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.038
We tend to act like the doomsday clock
has a snooze button.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.915
- How long until--
- days.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.917
At most.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.630
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.299
He wanted to make the earth kneel
before he destroyed us.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.218
This time he'll just go after the boxes.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.805
I got a location for
one of our recruits. Barry Allen.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.600
What about the other one?
Victor stone?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.060
I was hoping you would dig him up.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.774
We're asking people we don't know
to risk their lives.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.108
I know.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.236
That's how this works.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.688
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.232
You said that like it explains

36:32.399 --> 36:34.818
why there's a total stranger
in my place

36:34.984 --> 36:37.320
sitting in the dark
in my second favorite chair.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.989
Tell me about this.

36:44.285 --> 36:48.456
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.001
<i>Very attractive Jewish boy.</i>

36:52.794 --> 36:55.755
<i>Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?</i>

36:55.922 --> 36:57.799
<i>Or railroads?</i>

36:58.007 --> 36:59.884
I know you have abilities.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.137
I just don't know what they are.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.931
My special skills include viola,

37:05.098 --> 37:08.017
web design, fluent in sign language...

37:08.184 --> 37:09.185
Gorilla sign language.

37:09.352 --> 37:13.606
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.817
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.527
It's what they use on the space shuttle

37:17.610 --> 37:19.487
to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.073
I do very competitive ice dancing.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.119
Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.728
You're the Batman?

37:51.936 --> 37:53.354
So, you're fast.

37:54.314 --> 37:55.940
That feels like an oversimplification.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.652
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.362
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.281
Stop right there. I'm in.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.617
- You are?
- Yeah, uh...

38:06.201 --> 38:07.952
I need friends.

38:09.204 --> 38:13.750
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus. They, uh...

38:13.833 --> 38:16.711
They have, like, a rhythm that
i haven't quite been able to...

38:16.878 --> 38:17.879
Like brunch!

38:18.963 --> 38:20.673
Like, what is brunch?

38:20.840 --> 38:24.344
You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

38:24.511 --> 38:25.845
Imean...

38:26.638 --> 38:27.847
I don't know.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.559
People are a little slow.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.728
I'll try to keep up.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.480
Can I keep this?

38:36.523 --> 38:38.983
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

38:39.067 --> 38:40.235
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.736
I call it the speed force.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.655
Causes me to burn
a tremendous amount of calories.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.449
So I'm just a black hole of snacks.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.368
I am a "snack" hole.

38:49.369 --> 38:52.247
How many people
are on this special fight team?

38:52.413 --> 38:54.040
Three, including you.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.959
Three? Against what?

38:56.709 --> 38:58.211
I'll tell you on the plane.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.796
The plane?

39:00.547 --> 39:02.215
What are your superpowers again?

39:02.882 --> 39:04.217
I'm rich.

39:28.658 --> 39:32.161
The program always gets twitchy
with this footage.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.715
You know who we are.

39:48.678 --> 39:49.971
Are you Victor stone?

39:55.852 --> 39:57.103
I need to speak to you.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.940
No. Face-to-face.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.650
I'm old-fashioned that way.

40:05.862 --> 40:09.574
If I was going to attack you,
i would have done it by the lake.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.996
Looks like you have a date, Ms. prince.

40:16.623 --> 40:19.375
About time somebody here did.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.242
Face-to-face.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.745
I've been doing some tracking.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.376
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.253
If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge...

41:05.171 --> 41:06.172
I'll let you know.

41:06.339 --> 41:07.382
That's not good enough.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.342
Not good enough?

41:09.509 --> 41:10.885
<i>For you.</i>

41:11.552 --> 41:15.264
Look, I don't know you, and I don't know
how you got these gifts.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.599
Gifts?

41:16.766 --> 41:18.518
No one else can do what you do.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.980
If these are gifts,

41:22.146 --> 41:23.773
then why am I the one paying for them?

41:23.856 --> 41:25.441
We need you, Victor.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.277
And maybe you need us.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.571
I do fine alone.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.574
I told myself the same for a long time.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.124
I lost someone I loved once.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.295
I shut myself off...

41:47.296 --> 41:48.381
From everyone.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.676
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.348
The truth is I'm still working on it.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.435
And if you agreed to meet me,

42:02.270 --> 42:04.313
you're working on it, too.

42:05.732 --> 42:06.816
<i>Trust me, Victor.</i>

42:15.324 --> 42:17.577
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

42:19.120 --> 42:21.164
<i>Something came down from the sky!</i>

42:21.330 --> 42:22.540
<i>Cortlandt, you're cutting out.</i>

42:22.707 --> 42:23.791
<i>Please help me!</i>

42:46.439 --> 42:47.857
Whiskey.

42:48.441 --> 42:49.859
And one for ahab, there.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.319
From the sky.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.238
I... I heard a Cannon.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.656
To ocean's rage.

42:55.823 --> 42:56.824
They <i>came.</i>

42:57.700 --> 43:01.412
<i>Monsters from the sky.</i>

43:02.330 --> 43:04.165
<i>Tore right through my boat.</i>

43:05.875 --> 43:07.126
Monsters.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.046
It's on him.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.817
You took a hell of a hit.

45:37.401 --> 45:38.402
You all right?

45:38.486 --> 45:39.904
<i>At last.</i>

45:40.112 --> 45:42.448
The firstborn of beloved queen atlanna.

45:44.742 --> 45:45.826
Wait.

45:47.828 --> 45:48.829
Please.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.000
I knew her.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.545
Well, that makes one of us.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.339
When my parents fought in the wars

45:59.632 --> 46:00.633
she took me in.

46:00.800 --> 46:01.801
What a Saint.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.719
You dare speak
of queen atlanna that way?

46:03.886 --> 46:05.805
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

46:05.888 --> 46:06.973
and never gave me another thought.

46:07.056 --> 46:09.225
Your mother left you to save your life.

46:09.809 --> 46:12.103
Cannot imagine how it hurt her.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.729
What it cost her.

46:15.648 --> 46:17.400
But you're not a defenseless child now.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.903
It would have been her responsibility

46:21.070 --> 46:23.906
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.492
Now,

46:27.618 --> 46:28.619
it's yours.

46:30.871 --> 46:33.582
Then I'm gonna need something from you.

47:33.142 --> 47:35.144
Steppenvvolfi <i>I</i> see, mother.

47:36.187 --> 47:39.774
<i>I see why you waited to summon me.</i>

47:40.483 --> 47:45.488
<i>The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.</i>

47:45.654 --> 47:48.074
<i>Amazons, atlanteans,</i>

47:48.240 --> 47:52.286
each stands and falls alone.

47:55.915 --> 47:59.543
I know, mother,
you've waited too long for the unity.

47:59.752 --> 48:02.713
I know. But you will feed.

48:05.716 --> 48:09.428
And my exile will come to an end.

48:09.595 --> 48:13.641
I will take my place among the new gods.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.561
Find the last one!

48:18.145 --> 48:21.440
Its power will cleanse this world.

48:22.942 --> 48:24.693
For the unity!

48:26.362 --> 48:27.947
<i>For darkseid.</i>

48:36.872 --> 48:38.833
Oh, Victor.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.011
Asshole!

48:51.178 --> 48:53.764
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

48:53.931 --> 48:56.100
All the vics work for s.T.A.R. Labs.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.729
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

49:01.355 --> 49:05.067
"Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs."

49:05.234 --> 49:06.652
One of them was a little kid.

49:06.819 --> 49:08.904
Scared.
Won't say a word but drew this.

49:09.071 --> 49:11.240
- Looks like--
- I know what it looks like.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.243
Come on, you think he fights criminals
for 20 years here

49:14.410 --> 49:17.538
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

49:18.456 --> 49:19.999
I'll talk to him tonight.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.585
World's gone crazy, Jim.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.712
Maybe he did, too.

49:28.757 --> 49:30.009
Did you find the cyborg?

49:31.385 --> 49:32.970
We spoke.

49:33.179 --> 49:34.513
Give him time.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.349
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.018
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.395
That's not right. Great.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.481
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

49:43.689 --> 49:44.815
Oh!

49:44.899 --> 49:46.400
Awesome!

49:46.567 --> 49:48.360
That's the bat-signal! That's your...
Oh. Shh.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.196
Sorry. That's your signal.

49:50.362 --> 49:51.405
That means we have to go now.

49:51.572 --> 49:53.157
Yeah, that's... that's what that means.

49:53.324 --> 49:55.743
It's so cool.

50:30.319 --> 50:31.737
How many of you are there?

50:32.404 --> 50:33.948
Not enough.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.326
Eight people abducted from
or near s.T.A.R. Labs.

50:37.910 --> 50:39.620
<i>Here's the potential perp.</i>

50:40.204 --> 50:41.539
Parademons.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.207
Okay.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.334
The demons must have
caught the scent of the mother box.

50:45.543 --> 50:48.128
They carried people away to find out
what they know.

50:48.295 --> 50:49.922
- So the eight may still be alive.
- Nine.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.594
The head of s.T.A.R. Labs
was taken as well.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.846
You <i>made</i> it.

50:59.932 --> 51:02.518
<i>So then, there must be a nest nearby.</i>

51:02.726 --> 51:05.896
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.773
No pattern I can see.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.108
The lines on the map don't converge.

51:09.275 --> 51:10.568
On land.

51:10.734 --> 51:13.153
<i>These lead back to Braxton island
between the two cities.</i>

51:13.320 --> 51:14.446
Gotham harbor.

51:14.613 --> 51:15.781
These are air vents.

51:15.948 --> 51:18.158
They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis project

51:18.284 --> 51:20.119
that was abandoned in '29.

51:22.705 --> 51:24.373
Do you really think that...

51:25.624 --> 51:28.586
Oh, wow. They just...
They reallyjust vanish.

51:28.669 --> 51:29.837
Huh? Oh.

51:30.379 --> 51:31.672
That's rude.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.743
- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton <i>island.</i>

52:00.951 --> 52:05.372
You should be directly under
the venting tower for the tunnel.

52:05.539 --> 52:08.459
<i>Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.</i>

52:08.626 --> 52:10.669
<i>It'll give you access
to the machine room.</i>

52:16.925 --> 52:18.636
Define "access."

52:19.553 --> 52:21.597
One at a time.
The bridge may not...

52:22.431 --> 52:23.515
Hold.

52:28.729 --> 52:31.315
<i>Steppenwolf". Just tell me the truth.</i>

52:31.482 --> 52:34.026
<i>Please, just let us go.
I have a family.</i>

52:34.193 --> 52:35.444
<i>Steppenwolf". Wrong answer.</i>

52:36.695 --> 52:37.946
<i>Steppenwolf". Humans.</i>

52:38.113 --> 52:42.409
<i>The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.</i>

52:42.576 --> 52:44.370
Shall I feed them?

52:46.246 --> 52:49.541
You've been near the mother box.
Her scent is on you.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.044
Please. We have families.

52:52.211 --> 52:54.546
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

52:54.797 --> 52:56.715
<i>Howard". Please, please.</i>

52:56.882 --> 52:59.218
<i>Steppenwolf". I don't need to hurt you...</i>

52:59.426 --> 53:01.970
Right. Okay, yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

53:02.054 --> 53:07.476
See, I'm afraid of bugs and, uh,
guns and obnoxiously tall people.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.853
And murder. And I can't be here.

53:09.937 --> 53:13.148
It's really cool you guys seem ready
to do battle and stuff,

53:13.315 --> 53:15.818
but full transparency,
I've never done battle.

53:15.984 --> 53:18.278
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

53:18.904 --> 53:20.364
Save one.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.532
What?

53:21.657 --> 53:23.075
Save one person.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.744
Uh... which one?

53:25.953 --> 53:29.039
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

53:29.248 --> 53:30.499
And then?

53:30.749 --> 53:32.167
You'll know.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.129
Okay.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.089
%grunts)
%groans)

53:37.172 --> 53:38.841
Useless.

53:40.259 --> 53:41.802
You then.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.557
Where is my mother box?

53:48.183 --> 53:49.977
I'll die before I tell you.

53:50.185 --> 53:53.439
At last, one that doesn't whine.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.444
But you will scream.

54:03.323 --> 54:04.324
Dad.

54:05.075 --> 54:06.243
Victor.

54:06.410 --> 54:09.788
Ah. You were born of her.

54:10.497 --> 54:12.499
A creature of chaos.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.168
Not how I see it.

54:14.376 --> 54:16.044
Give it time.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.005
Ahh!

54:29.183 --> 54:31.059
Amazon!

54:40.027 --> 54:41.987
Okay.

54:42.154 --> 54:44.072
Save one. Save one.

54:54.249 --> 54:55.834
This one is mine.

54:57.878 --> 54:59.963
You overestimate yourself.

55:00.172 --> 55:06.011
Child, my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

55:20.359 --> 55:22.069
Alfred, I need the knightcrawler.

55:22.236 --> 55:23.904
Thought you'd never ask.

55:24.071 --> 55:26.448
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

55:40.379 --> 55:41.672
- Okay, you good?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

55:41.839 --> 55:44.466
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

55:44.633 --> 55:46.593
He's after the change engine.
His mother box.

55:46.802 --> 55:47.803
You have to keep him from it.

55:47.928 --> 55:50.556
- Help people get to safety. Go!
- Promise me!

56:17.624 --> 56:20.085
%groans)
{Yells)

56:26.383 --> 56:27.509
Steppenwolfi finish her!

56:32.097 --> 56:33.473
Sorry, <i>guys.</i>

56:34.683 --> 56:36.310
I didn't bring a sword.

56:49.406 --> 56:52.075
Jesus. He is tall.

57:37.454 --> 57:38.455
Oh, fuck.

57:51.176 --> 57:52.219
Uh...

58:02.270 --> 58:06.525
So, you have the blood of the old gods
in you.

58:12.239 --> 58:14.116
The old gods died.

58:23.542 --> 58:24.835
No!

58:43.103 --> 58:44.563
<i>Cyborg". Heads up.</i>

58:55.115 --> 58:57.826
Thanks, Alfred,
but I'll take it from here.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.078
Uh, do I know you?

59:17.137 --> 59:19.931
Primitive beings.

59:24.644 --> 59:26.271
What are we under right now?

59:29.024 --> 59:30.442
Gotham harbor.

59:34.237 --> 59:35.322
You all need to move.

59:35.405 --> 59:36.406
You get him out.

59:36.490 --> 59:37.574
Diana, there's no time.

59:37.741 --> 59:39.743
Also among my fears is drowning.

59:39.868 --> 59:42.037
You are a distraction.

59:42.704 --> 59:44.748
Mother is calling.

59:48.668 --> 59:49.920
<i>Diana, come on!</i>

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.202
Oh, come on.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.124
Whoa!

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.431
The change engine.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.438
<i>Did he just bail?</i>

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:55.402
<i>Gordon". Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.</i>

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.405
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.785
Dressed like a bat.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:05.078
<i>L</i> dig it.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:08.248
May be temporary.

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:10.667
So, what made you change your mind?

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:11.918
Steppenwolf.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.379
He took the mother box from Atlantis.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.424
All he needs now is the lost box of men.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:18.800
If he doesn't already have it.

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:23.680
He doesn't have it.

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:13.813
Wow! It's like a cave.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.318
Like a batcave.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.657
Barry.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.118
My father called it
a change engine.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.788
It was found by the British
during world war I.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:33.166
They studied it, but they
couldn't even date it, it's so old.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:37.504
It was shelved till
the night superman died.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.756
Then she lit up like Christmas.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:40.966
They brought it to s.T.A.R. Labs

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:44.469
where my father recognized it
as a perpetual energy matrix.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:47.639
Oh, that sounds cool.
I thought it was like a nuclear bomb.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.933
A mother box destroys as it creates.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.728
It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.940
<i>My father thought it was
the key to unlimited energy.</i>

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.483
<i>New formulas.</i>

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.069
Cellular regeneration.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.071
<i>But it's too volatile to control.</i>

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:04.781
He used it on you.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.242
I was in an accident.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.619
<i>Should've died.</i>

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:12.289
<i>My father thought
that he could use the mother box</i>

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.417
<i>to rebuild the broken parts of me
with a few cybernetic enhancements.</i>

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.585
<i>Instead, he built a living machine</i>

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.796
that may be stronger than its host.

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.089
<i>Bruce". Too much.</i>

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:22.966
Too much life.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.552
What's on your weird mind?

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:30.682
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.018
A human being can only absorb so much.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:37.188
The mother box was designed
to reshape a planet.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.565
So?

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.651
So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:46.323
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.908
<i>If you were in a conductive field,</i>

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.161
a boost from the mother box--

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.455
could bring him back to life.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:59.044
The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic
chamber, which would be a perfect--

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.170
no.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.755
- Diana.
- Bruce, no.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.382
You have no idea what kind of power
you are dealing with.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.051
Even if there's a fraction of a chance?

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.762
That what? That we could raise a monster
like Luthor did?

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.305
We have tech Luthor's never even seen.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:12.140
Superman is dead.

01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:14.684
We all wish he weren't.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.436
We don't know what state he's in.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.438
We know we can't bring him back.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:21.191
But this is science beyond our limits.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.109
And that's what science is for.
To do what's never been done.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.319
To make life better.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:25.695
Or to end it.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.655
Technology is like any other power.

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:31.242
Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.079
You're risking lives.

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:36.498
Theirs and maybe countless more.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.042
We don't have time for a control group.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.877
Is it a risk? Yes. But it's necessary.

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.587
Why, because of your guilt?

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:46.966
Bruce, I was there.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.843
You didn't kill superman.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.931
At some point, even you have to learn
to move on.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.433
Steve Trevor tell you that?

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:11.157
Superman was a beacon to the world.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.743
Why aren't you?

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.455
<i>You're an inspiration, Diana.</i>

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.416
You don't just save people,

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.501
you make them see their better selves.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.129
<i>And yet, I'd never heard of you</i>

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:28.883
until Luthor lured you out by stealing
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:36.099
You shut yourself down for a century,
so let's not talk about me moving on.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:41.146
You know that if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:43.106
We are not enough!

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:44.983
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.610
And I promise you, steppenwolf is not
out there talking about ethics.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.363
He's trying to burn down the world!

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.783
The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power,

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.953
this power, against him.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:59.038
I agree.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.002
I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the mother box,

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.254
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.756
<i>and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.</i>

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:12.010
Right, right. But we mean bring him back
in like a "yay, he's back!" Way,

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:16.473
<i>not in like</i> a <i>pet sematary scenario.</i>

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.183
You lose something when you die.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.602
Even superman.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.395
Maybe not his mind.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:23.938
Maybe his soul.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.025
I'll have a contingency plan for that.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.694
If he wakes up
and you're the first thing he sees,

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.821
you'll need one.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.210
Well, that was fun while it didn't last.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.004
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.131
I don't see why you're pushing her.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.384
We have to boost the signal.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:54.969
Put it through the Batmobile speakers.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.346
Yeah, now you're changing the subject.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:57.972
I have a contingency.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:06:59.974
<i>Diana was right about the risk.</i>

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.894
If the plan goes south,
we're gonna bring in the big guns.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.437
But that's not...

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.773
Those are very big guns.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.107
You've got a team here.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.735
Superman would bring this team together
better than I ever could.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.196
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.864
<i>Or what abilities you might have--</i>

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.658
he was more human than I am.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:22.789
He lived in this world.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.458
Fell in love. Had a job.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:28.211
Despite all that power.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.798
The world needs superman.

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.095
And the team needs Clark.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.888
And what does Clark need?

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.975
Maybe he's at peace.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.310
He'll get over it.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:58.283
You know, I could do this
a lot faster. I just...

01:07:58.449 --> 01:07:59.826
Ls it weird that it feels disrespectful?

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:01.744
<i>'($9-</i>

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.248
do... do you feel a sense of confidence

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:09.377
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:11.004
Not really.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:14.132
- Okay, then why--
- because I saw steppenwolf up close.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:18.051
The stories Diana told us.
I believe them.

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.430
But we gotta stop him.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.889
That's the plan.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.183
That's the plan.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.522
Okay. We're not ready for...

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.774
...racially charged...

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:35.486
You got struck by lightning, huh?

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.865
Uh, yeah, that's the abridged version.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:41.200
- And you...
- Explosion.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:42.577
Woke up in a lab.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.162
So we're the accidents.

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.040
Yeah, that's us.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.376
Hey.No,no.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.515
<i>We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.</i>

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:06.392
<i>Eta 30 seconds.</i>

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.816
I'm here for him.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.111
- I swear I would never--
- save it.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.591
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.301
Okay.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.158
This is amazing.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:06.619
This is crazy.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:08.621
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:11.541
You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:03.468
<i>N". Welcome.</i>

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.472
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.682
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:12.560
I might be able to do it.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.395
<i>I might be able to jump-start it.</i>

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:15.563
If I can get enough distance,

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.565
I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.484
I might be able to wake the box.

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:23.404
- If that's still what we want.
- We have to try.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:29.994
This must be the end of the line.

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.454
<i>So, I'm in position.</i>

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.125
<i>Cyborg". The mother box is ready.</i>

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.711
<i>You have to charge it
the moment it touches the fluid.</i>

01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:40.713
- Five.
- Five.

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:43.508
Diana's right. This is a bad idea.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.635
- Four.
- Four.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:49.055
- Three.
- Three.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:50.515
Two.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.683
Two.

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:54.352
One.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.708
He's back.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.059
<i>Dispatch, this is 3-Adam-1-6.
Backing up code three.</i>

01:13:58.225 --> 01:13:59.393
<i>I'm currently two minutes out.</i>

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:04.023
He's not all right.

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:05.900
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.320
He's scanning us.

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:10.488
What?

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.531
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.950
Because he's not all right.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.117
Oh, no.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:18.037
Should we bow? Or show our bellies?

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.667
Victor? Victor!

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:24.710
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.921
- It's my armor's defense system.
- No!

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:29.173
It's stronger since the interface.
I can't control it.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.508
- Victor, no!
- Victor!

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.426
<i>Just think
happy thoughts, Victor.</i>

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:33.970
<i>Go to a happier place.</i>

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:46.607
Kal-El, no!

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.201
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:58.995
<i>Pet sematary.</i>

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.294
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:13.426
<i>Cyborg". I got him.</i>

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:34.697
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.325
Remember who you are.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.787
Tell me who you--

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:39.845
Batman; Clark.

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:45.810
I know you.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.318
Please don't make me do this.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.466
Alfred, I need the big gun--

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.640
you did this.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.142
<i>Wad to.</i>

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:28.561
You won't let me live.

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:31.480
You won't let me die.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.607
The world needs you.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.156
But does it need you?

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.825
Tell me.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.787
Do you bleed?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:49.832
<i>Clark?</i>

01:17:58.632 --> 01:17:59.717
Clark.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.428
Please.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:22.698
Please.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:31.207
Please.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:33.292
Just go.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:35.211
Yeah.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.463
Let's go.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.478
Yeah, something is definitely bleeding.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:13.791
The mother box.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.169
<i>He has the last one.</i>

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:33.644
You brought us here.

01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:36.188
You remembered.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.484
This is home.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.196
You smell good.

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:49.535
Did I not before?

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.302
Don't do that.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.470
<i>We just got our asses
handed to us.</i>

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.556
And steppenwolf has got the third box.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:12.433
<i>So we find them.</i>

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:14.810
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:18.022
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:19.315
Steppenwolf's gonna
be keeping them

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:20.482
somewhere where they don't read.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.359
No Internet, no satellite coverage.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:24.695
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Not enough.

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:26.613
So, you can't find them.

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.532
Or maybe you don't want to.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.037
Arthur.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.705
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of superman.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.999
Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.959
Right. 'Cause you can't control
the machine.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:43.422
Uh, so, is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.051
Very huhqfy-

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.387
Victor.

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:54.016
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.977
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:59.772
I promise, we will pull you back out.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.028
Just keep the little merman away from me
while I work.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.617
Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry.

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:15.371
When you come back, get online.
Everybody checks everybody else's work.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:17.706
Listen.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:21.627
I was wondering if you could
put out a, you know, a feeler.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:24.838
Like, aquatic. You know.

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:28.258
I don't know... do you talk to fish?

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.471
The water does the talking.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.556
Of course.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:37.142
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:38.394
Okay.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.168
<i>Wait.</i>

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:05.129
Let me.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.840
It's just a little out of place.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:13.595
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.097
He could've killed you.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.558
I was willing to make the trade.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:21.603
And bringing in Lois Lane?

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.856
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.149
I bet you.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:26.859
...thought I wasn't listening.

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:28.986
Thank you.

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.825
You know you can't do this forever.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.118
I can barely do it now.

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:38.287
Steppenwolf.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.038
This is the job.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.248
<i>It's my job.</i>

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.960
And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:47.379
Not leading.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.717
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor--

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.594
it wasn't my business. I'm sorry.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:58.098
You were pushing me to lead the team,

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.434
but leaders get people killed.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.229
I fought always

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.607
when I was needed.

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:11.695
But to lead, to step into the light
and to say to people,

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:13.405
"this is worth your life."

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:16.992
When it's your fault...

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.163
They're all Steve Trevor.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:27.252
We make it through tonight,
you can stay in the shadows forever.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.464
Dress up like a bat.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:31.673
<i>I won't even sue.</i>

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:35.260
If we get through the night.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.366
Are you okay?

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:02.621
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:04.665
I know. It's...

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:09.169
I just got out of a wooden box.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.298
What was it like?

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:16.176
Coming back?

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:21.390
<i>Fishy .</i>

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.685
<i>I mean, honestly,</i>

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:27.938
weird in so many ways.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:30.691
<i>But mostly just--</i>

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.442
I wasn't strong.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.155
<i>I didn't, um...</i>

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:40.158
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:45.747
I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter. I just...

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.333
It's okay.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.796
I'm the idiot who left.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.716
But I'm back now.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.135
And I'm gonna make things right.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.238
Ah.

01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:20.407
You called mom.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.784
Of course.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.119
Thank you.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:30.751
I was hoping it was gonna take you
longer to recover.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.086
Why?

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:37.424
Because now I have to send you away.

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:40.636
Bruce.

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:42.471
He needs you.

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:45.724
Fate of the world, I think that's
the deal. He was pretty tense.

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:49.353
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:50.562
Right.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:53.231
But no dying.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:55.901
And I get the exclusive.

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.320
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.732
Are you really you?

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.401
I'm really me, ma.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.277
Oh!

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.622
At last.

01:26:52.749 --> 01:26:55.127
Praise to the unity!

01:26:57.713 --> 01:26:59.840
<i>The three as one!</i>

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:30.704
Praise to the mother of horrors.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:41.715
Ls steppenwolf there?

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:43.592
Just a minute.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:45.594
Sorry.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.013
It's pozharnov in northern Russia.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:49.514
The nuclear plant.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.433
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:53.185
Uh-huh. There have been some attempts
to resettle nearby.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:55.979
But it looks like really rough sledding.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.316
Who picks this place to put down roots?

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:01.318
People that have been kicked out
of everywhere else.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:04.863
<i>The earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.</i>

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.532
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.785
Transport won't fly that fast.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.621
It will for me.

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:56.873
The unity brings all three boxes
together in perfect sync.

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.627
Its power builds
until it can't be contained.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:05.006
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.634
its energy will cascade, form a loop.

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:09.469
They'll feed on each other.

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:11.012
And that's it?
We just pull them apart?

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.889
<i>No fuss, no muss.</i>

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:15.475
Separating the boxes
is still gonna cause a massive surge.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.810
I'll have to be there.

01:29:16.977 --> 01:29:18.854
<i>But you guys should think about
getting clear.</i>

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:20.272
We're with you till it's done.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:22.566
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:24.192
<i>And you know what?</i>

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.945
I don't mind. It's an honorable end.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:29.906
But we gotta shut steppenwolf down.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.284
Superman's a no-show.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.327
You got no powers. No offense.

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:37.163
<i>This guy might be working for the enemy,
we don't know.</i>

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.291
You're tripping over your feet and mine.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.418
Oof...

01:29:41.501 --> 01:29:42.544
You're gorgeous.

01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:45.505
<i>And fierce, and strong, and... mmm.</i>

01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:47.966
I know we went to war with the Amazons,
but that was before my time.

01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:50.594
And you know what? I don't wanna die.

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:52.804
I'm young.
There's shit that I want to do.

01:29:53.763 --> 01:29:57.183
<i>I just feel like I didn't really
embrace the sea or the land.</i>

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:58.768
I've been a loner my whole life.

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:01.771
But being part of something
bigger like this...

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:06.443
Maybe I'm scared because I'm meant to--

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.081
I think that was beautiful.

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:25.211
You say a word about this

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:27.005
and you'll meet every piranha I know.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.969
I honestly didn't hear anything after,
"we're all gonna die."

01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:57.160
Ah. Let them come.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.544
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:08.588
<i>You get to steppenwolf.</i>

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:10.966
Don't wait for me, just do the job.

01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:17.073
All right, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:20.243
Playing all your favorite hits.

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:32.672
Come on. Follow me, you damn insects.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:44.893
They're coming.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.146
They're all coming.

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.275
<i>Ah.</i>

01:32:52.358 --> 01:32:54.861
We might not have thought this through.

01:32:58.615 --> 01:32:59.991
He's clearing the field.

01:33:00.658 --> 01:33:01.659
He won't last three minutes.

01:33:02.368 --> 01:33:03.495
Then let's use them.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.458
On my lead.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.532
<i>Critical damage.</i>

01:34:24.117 --> 01:34:26.035
Son of a bitch.

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:30.665
Oh, snap!

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:35.336
You're welcome.

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:39.591
Aquamani yeah!

01:34:39.757 --> 01:34:41.092
This isn't the plan.

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:42.510
<i>Alfred". No, master Wayne.</i>

01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:44.971
This is the team.

01:34:45.096 --> 01:34:46.598
Hey, blame the lady.

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:48.850
We would've left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:54.480
<i>So, your genius move is dying?</i>

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.274
You really are out of your mind.

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:58.484
I'm not the one who brought a pitchfork.

01:35:00.236 --> 01:35:02.363
Yahoo!

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:22.884
Ride ain't over yet.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:24.219
My man.

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:11.683
<i>Is this what conquering is?</i>

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.768
Hiding from the fight?

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:15.311
Oh, no.

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:17.939
You're all mine.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.738
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:27.991
- You got this?
- Whoa!

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:30.076
These things are gonna keep coming.

01:36:30.243 --> 01:36:32.161
Okay. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:33.371
Let's do it.

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:41.337
Yes! That was gross! Oh...

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.692
Thank you.

01:37:04.235 --> 01:37:05.403
This is...

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.614
This is a lot.

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:31.220
Now do you see it?

01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:52.575
<i>Whatever
you're in the middle of,</i>

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:54.160
<i>it's spreading for miles.</i>

01:37:54.327 --> 01:37:57.080
Satellites show civilians moving east.

01:37:57.663 --> 01:37:59.123
They're not gonna make it.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.333
Barry.

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:02.543
<i>I need you to take a walk.</i>

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:10.885
God, I hope this is east.

01:38:56.597 --> 01:39:00.017
You're not worthy to touch mother.

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.103
She's power,

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:05.773
and power is the only law.

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:14.407
You're all too weak to see the truth.

01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:15.491
<i>Well,</i>

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.370
<i>I believe in truth.</i>

01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:23.249
But I'm also a big fan of justice.

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:32.300
All right.

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.264
Kryptonian!

01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:56.824
So, how do I help?

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.117
We buy him some time,

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:00.495
he can stop that box
from destroying all life on earth.

01:40:01.913 --> 01:40:02.914
We hope.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.666
Well, I knew you didn't bring me back
'cause you liked me.

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:08.544
I don't not...

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:15.968
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed--

01:40:16.135 --> 01:40:17.345
there's too many of them.

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:27.271
Come on.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.829
Okay, this is definitely east.

01:40:50.419 --> 01:40:51.420
Slowpoke.

01:40:52.046 --> 01:40:53.422
Oh, it's on.

01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:54.966
I'll take the ones on the right.

01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:58.719
It's okay. Uh...

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.556
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:20.950
Dostoevsky!

01:41:38.301 --> 01:41:40.595
Ls this guy
still bothering you?

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:55.443
Superman!

01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:57.153
<i>We gotta pull these things apart.</i>

01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.780
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

01:42:00.573 --> 01:42:01.657
Any blowback?

01:42:01.824 --> 01:42:02.992
Big time.

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:04.619
But I think we can take it.

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:05.786
Good.

01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:08.623
'Cause I really like being alive.

01:42:09.165 --> 01:42:10.791
So do I.

01:42:33.898 --> 01:42:35.232
Clark.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.032
I take it back.

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:44.617
I wanna die.

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:51.374
Man, my <i>toes hurt!</i>

01:42:51.457 --> 01:42:54.418
I don't even understand the physics
of how my toes hurt.

01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:58.839
Children. I work with children.

01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:04.804
Uh... have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:17.858
I am the end of worlds!

01:43:18.609 --> 01:43:22.822
Who are you to defy me?

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:26.909
This world is my right!

01:43:48.347 --> 01:43:49.974
No!

01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:51.684
This cannot be.

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:53.519
You recognize that smell?

01:43:55.396 --> 01:43:56.439
Feat

01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:01.944
no! Leave me!

01:44:05.448 --> 01:44:07.658
Get off me! I command you.

01:44:10.119 --> 01:44:11.662
<i>No!</i>

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:14.206
No!

01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.127
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

01:44:18.294 --> 01:44:19.879
I'll kill you all!

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:46.572
Booyah!

01:45:11.889 --> 01:45:13.432
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:16.018
So am l.

01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:17.686
Yeah.

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:19.271
Now she's glad.

01:45:50.052 --> 01:45:52.972
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:56.475
L just undid a mistake, that's all.

01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:07.570
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:10.072
I bought the bank.

01:46:12.449 --> 01:46:13.701
The whole bank?

01:46:13.868 --> 01:46:16.537
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:20.916
What?

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:24.378
It's actually the worst job you can get
in a crime lab.

01:46:24.545 --> 01:46:27.047
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

01:46:27.464 --> 01:46:29.925
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:31.635
This is like a "job" job?

01:46:32.428 --> 01:46:33.470
"Job" job.

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:38.809
Look at you go.

01:46:57.036 --> 01:47:02.207
<i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

01:47:04.209 --> 01:47:07.796
<i>It is the conviction
that the light will never return.</i>

01:47:07.963 --> 01:47:10.215
Must be 100, 150 feet.

01:47:10.799 --> 01:47:11.926
Must be.

01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:15.012
Big round table.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.389
Six chairs, right there.

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:19.975
But room for more.

01:47:22.561 --> 01:47:23.854
But room for more.

01:47:25.731 --> 01:47:28.150
<i>But the light always returns</i>

01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:30.194
<i>to show us things familiar.</i>

01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:34.406
<i>Home, family,</i>

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.955
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

01:47:46.251 --> 01:47:50.965
<i>It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.</i>

01:47:52.549 --> 01:47:54.343
Yeah, and Jerry monasco
runs the whole kit.

01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:56.428
I mean, he did the bilbao job
two years ago.

01:47:56.595 --> 01:47:58.305
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in croydon.

01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:00.224
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:03.519
<i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

01:48:03.686 --> 01:48:07.314
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:14.113
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

01:48:14.822 --> 01:48:17.658
But <i>these</i> heroes
were here the whole time

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:23.580
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:30.504
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:34.341
<i>up in the sky.</i>

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:35.152
I can't tell you how much
i appreciate you doing this.

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:37.279
Not at all, Barry.

01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:39.031
Curious myself.

01:49:39.198 --> 01:49:41.075
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.368
Well, it is a competition.

01:49:43.535 --> 01:49:46.371
But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

01:49:46.538 --> 01:49:47.956
But if I win, you're off the team.

01:49:54.254 --> 01:49:55.297
- No...
- Oof.

01:49:57.049 --> 01:49:58.550
If I win...

01:49:58.926 --> 01:50:01.678
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

01:50:01.887 --> 01:50:04.223
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

01:50:04.848 --> 01:50:06.350
I feel stung by that.

01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:09.520
Okay, but if I win,
i get to tell everyone.

01:50:09.686 --> 01:50:10.687
Deal.

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:12.606
Which coast?

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.275
Uh, you know,
I've never seen the pacific.

01:50:16.735 --> 01:50:17.861
Which is that way.

01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:20.989
Because the sun, and it's...

01:58:07.122 --> 01:58:08.290
All right,
let's keep it moving.

01:58:08.456 --> 01:58:10.500
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:12.794
<i>Luthor!</i>

01:58:22.137 --> 01:58:25.432
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

01:58:58.256 --> 01:59:00.467
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

01:59:00.634 --> 01:59:02.385
Care for a glass of goflt de diamants?

01:59:02.927 --> 01:59:06.806
I was just celebrating god's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

01:59:07.515 --> 01:59:10.727
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

01:59:10.852 --> 01:59:12.145
You better not
be wasting my time.

01:59:12.354 --> 01:59:16.149
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

01:59:16.274 --> 01:59:18.943
<i>We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.</i>

01:59:19.903 --> 01:59:21.279
To put it plainly,

01:59:23.156 --> 01:59:26.368
shouldn't we have a league of our own?

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:56.481
English - sdh
