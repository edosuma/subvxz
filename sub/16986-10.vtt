00:40.832 --> 00:42.417
Kids, we told you,
no eating rocks.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.877
They'll spoil your dinner.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.214
Not eating.
Licking!

00:47.297 --> 00:49.049
No licking stuff, period.

00:49.132 --> 00:53.095
There's a case of "sneezles" going around,
and we don't want you getting sick.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.181
You guys never let us do anything fun.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.559
No staying up after moonrise,

00:58.642 --> 01:03.105
no playing egg toss inside,
no throwing rocks at Thunk.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.607
Yeah!
And no throwing rocks at me.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.360
Trust us, Eep.
The sneezles are not fun.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.195
They're even worse
than the "coughles."

He's right.

Until we're feeling better,
the only thing for you kids to do is...

01:32.217 --> 01:33.552
Put you out of your misery?

01:33.635 --> 01:34.635
I won't do it!

01:35.804 --> 01:37.055
Well, I guess I could try.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.141
Whoa!
No! No.

my quiet walk for that exact reason.

You guys avoided
the "sneezles", too?

Yep.
I couldn't get them if I tried.

Mom and Dad say
no jumping on strange animals.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.417
But Mom and Dad
are off puking their guts out.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.629
[laughs] No grownups means
we can do whatever we want.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.005
Go for it, Sandy.

- Yeah.

in charge of you is... is you!

Oh, animal fights are great!

never lets us watch this stuff.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.644
Wait.
You wanna hunt that guy?

04:29.728 --> 04:31.205
I thought we were just gonna pet him.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.647
What?
No.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.400
We can do whatever we want,
and I wanna bonk some prey.

04:35.484 --> 04:40.989
Ah! But that means we can also
not do what we don't not want not to do.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.615
Not.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.328
What I'm saying is
I'm not in the mood for mosquitoad.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.497
How about spikeapples?
Anyone?

04:49.414 --> 04:53.168
Let's all be honest.
I'm not so much a hunter as a "hunted."

04:53.251 --> 04:54.169
Fine.

04:54.252 --> 04:59.674
You do what you want, I'll do what I want,
and Sandy, do what Sandy wants.

Spikeapples.
The forbidden fruit.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.272
Forbidden 'cause my parents
think I'll spike my eye out.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.484
That fruit looks... angry.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.402
[grunting]

05:19.486 --> 05:23.031
Now to pick it very carefully.

Ow.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.372
Hey, I picked three already!

05:31.289 --> 05:33.375
What's the plan?
Tickle torture?

05:33.458 --> 05:35.043
My ticklers are ready.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.629
Uh, I just thought
we'd throw these rocks at it.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.172
[gasps]
Brilliant.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.925
Then we tickle.

There.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.821
Why were
you messing with spikeapples?

06:02.904 --> 06:06.032
The whole point of the spikes
is so you won't touch them.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.618
Me?
You nearly bonked me to death.

06:08.702 --> 06:12.080
Didn't Mom and Dad teach you anything
about hunting rock safety?

06:12.163 --> 06:16.126
Didn't Mom and Dad teach you
anything about doing what I say?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.544
No way.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.381
I'm in charge of me.
You be in charge of you.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.301
Fine.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.804
Then from now on, you can be
in charge of you on that side.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.724
This is my side.
You stay out of it.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.602
Happy to.
My side's got more sunshine.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.812
Well, my side's got better clouds.

Of course she wants to do
something crazy and dangerous.

She can't be trusted like us.

Okay, we must've reached the part
of the sneezles where we hallucinate.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.351
Definitely.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.853
[snoring]

11:29.939 --> 11:30.940
[sneezing]

11:34.360 --> 11:36.321
[music playing]

11:41.367 --> 11:44.662
Food, food, food, food!

11:44.746 --> 11:46.956
Here ya go, Croods.
Eat up!

11:49.959 --> 11:51.419
[growling]

11:51.502 --> 11:53.212
Food, food, food!

11:53.296 --> 11:56.424
I know, I know.
We've eaten a lot of sticks lately.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.509
But it's this awful food shortage.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.261
Everyone is struggling.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.347
Tree, I'm warning you.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.516
Grow fruit now or so help me...

12:05.600 --> 12:07.936
[wind blowing]

12:08.019 --> 12:10.188
Oh, the silent treatment, huh?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.606
[chuckles]
Why, you...

12:11.689 --> 12:12.815
[pants]

12:12.899 --> 12:13.733
[grunts]

12:13.816 --> 12:17.403
[moans]
Plenty more where that came from.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.529
[groans]

12:20.823 --> 12:21.908
Gee, Dad,

12:21.991 --> 12:27.538
[scoffs] with prey so scarce,
I bet you hunters need extra help.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.582
No, Eep, you're not ready.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.376
You're still just a kid.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.670
- Please?
- No!

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
Please!

12:35.838 --> 12:37.548
No!

12:38.466 --> 12:42.345
[wailing] Please!

12:42.887 --> 12:44.514
I said no!

12:44.597 --> 12:46.182
Stop dragging this out.

12:46.265 --> 12:50.269
[grunts]
But I am a natural hunter.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.606
My class voted me
most likely to mangle.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.983
[straining]

12:55.066 --> 12:58.236
I know, but there's more
to my job than mangling.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.863
- [grunting]
- It's hot, it's boring,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.740
you have to laugh
at your boss' jokes.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.242
[straining]
And when it gets tough,

13:04.325 --> 13:07.036
a hunter's gotta be grown up
enough to hold on.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.499
But I am grown up enough to hold on.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.292
Love our talks.
Bye!

13:13.793 --> 13:15.211
[grunts]

13:15.294 --> 13:17.005
[groans]

13:17.088 --> 13:19.340
[gasps]
Food!

13:19.424 --> 13:21.009
- Food!
- Food!

13:21.092 --> 13:22.092
Food!

13:26.264 --> 13:28.808
Why is everyone yelling "food"?

13:28.891 --> 13:31.185
Oh, 'cause there is food.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.396
[panting]

13:33.479 --> 13:34.897
[yelling]

13:34.981 --> 13:36.649
[all]
Mine!

13:36.733 --> 13:39.235
[all]
Not yours! Mine!

13:39.318 --> 13:40.903
[all]
Stop that!

13:40.987 --> 13:42.447
I'm a poop head.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.531
Ah...

13:45.450 --> 13:46.450
Oh...
[chuckles]

13:46.492 --> 13:49.537
I thought if I said that,
I could get the rest of you to say it.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.873
That's embarrassing.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.460
[gnawing]

13:56.586 --> 13:59.547
[sighs]
Mom, do I have to help feed Sandy?

13:59.630 --> 14:01.382
It's always such a big mess.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.053
[growling, laughing]
Aah!

14:05.136 --> 14:06.929
We gotta make sure
she eats, Thunk.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.432
After all, she's just a helpless baby.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.100
Now pin her down!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.311
[yelling]

14:13.394 --> 14:15.688
[panting]

14:15.772 --> 14:19.192
I know you hate sticks, sweetie,
but it's for your own good.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.944
[straining]

14:25.740 --> 14:26.741
Whoa!

14:29.369 --> 14:30.745
- [grunting]
- Wow!

14:30.828 --> 14:32.455
What's that girl been eating?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.290
Oh, yeah.
Nothing.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.250
- I saw it first!
- I am the toucher.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.771
- You were standing over there...
- I just enjoy the camaraderie!

14:38.795 --> 14:39.712
Enough!

14:39.796 --> 14:41.672
No one can prove
who touched the egg first,

14:41.756 --> 14:45.885
so let's just say whoever's
touching it last takes it home.

14:45.968 --> 14:46.803
[all]
Agreed!

14:46.886 --> 14:48.930
- Agreed.
- Go home, Eep.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.391
This contest is about to get
really tough.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.850
Exactly.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.144
So when I'm the last Crood standing,

14:55.228 --> 14:57.897
you'll see that
I'm grown up enough to hunt.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.732
Victory pose.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.441
[gasping]

15:02.068 --> 15:03.986
[grunts]
Ah! There.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.613
Victory pose!

15:05.696 --> 15:06.696
Pelt yourself.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.991
Don't say I didn't warn you
when things heat up.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.039
[screams]
Oh! Ah!

15:15.123 --> 15:17.834
[wailing]

15:19.877 --> 15:20.877
[blows]

15:24.215 --> 15:25.215
[blows]

15:27.385 --> 15:29.470
[shivering]

15:29.554 --> 15:31.597
[moaning]

15:32.515 --> 15:34.809
I didn't think he'd really do it.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.478
[moaning]

15:39.522 --> 15:41.232
Sweet relief.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.817
[sighs]
One down.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.610
[giggle]
Three to go.

15:44.694 --> 15:48.114
And one, two, three, four toes
I can still feel.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.073
[chuckles]

15:49.157 --> 15:49.991
[shivers]

15:50.074 --> 15:52.410
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.662
I keep all my tension in my shoulders.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.539
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.623
[growling]

15:57.707 --> 15:59.167
[shivering]

16:03.212 --> 16:05.423
[moaning]

16:08.092 --> 16:10.011
No egg is worth this.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.681
I'm walking away
while I still have my dignity.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.937
[chuckles]

16:20.021 --> 16:21.189
[gasps, screams]

16:21.272 --> 16:22.565
[shrieking]

16:23.566 --> 16:24.817
And what about you, Eep?

16:24.901 --> 16:26.777
- Ready to quit?
- No.

16:26.861 --> 16:31.365
I just need something
to take my mind off the pain,

16:31.449 --> 16:36.078
like, like... [gasps]
other pain.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.789
[grunting]

16:38.873 --> 16:40.791
[babbling]

16:40.875 --> 16:42.293
It worked.
[laugh]

16:42.376 --> 16:44.128
I can't even feel my legs anymore.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.838
[chuckles]

16:45.922 --> 16:47.423
[sighs]

16:48.424 --> 16:51.636
Hey, Sandy, sorry we tried to
make you eat sticks before.

16:51.719 --> 16:56.474
Instead, how about a bite
of delicious ramu?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.935
[clucking]

17:01.604 --> 17:02.438
See?

17:02.522 --> 17:07.401
Thanks to pretending,
she sees the stick as a big, juicy bird.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.319
[clucking]

17:14.450 --> 17:17.453
Check that.
She sees me as a big, juicy bird.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.954
[screaming]

17:26.712 --> 17:30.132
What?
[gasps] Everyone's gone?

17:30.216 --> 17:33.553
[giggling] Oh, they quit,
they quit, they quit!

17:33.636 --> 17:35.555
Oh, did they?

17:35.638 --> 17:36.722
[screams]

17:36.806 --> 17:41.227
Watch what you eat, Eep,
or it might just eat you.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.854
[laughs]

17:43.938 --> 17:45.856
[screams]

17:45.940 --> 17:48.776
There's only one way out of this.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.237
[grunting]

17:52.655 --> 17:54.740
Eep, Eep, wake up, Eep.

17:54.824 --> 17:55.908
- Eep!
- What?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.285
What?
What happened?

17:57.368 --> 17:58.286
Oh, nothing.

17:58.369 --> 18:01.205
Just that you lost your mind
and tried to eat your arm!

18:01.289 --> 18:03.374
Come on, this has gone too far.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.457
Now go home.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.295
[sighs]
You're right, Dad.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.380
Please!
I... I am?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.424
I wasn't ready for that.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.051
Well, don't feel bad, sweetie.

18:14.135 --> 18:19.724
No, no, I... I tried my best
and I guess I'm just not good enough.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.019
[sniffling, sobbing]

18:24.020 --> 18:25.938
Oh, honey.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.691
- Come here.
- Boom! You're out!

18:28.774 --> 18:29.942
[laughing]

18:30.026 --> 18:31.611
What?
You tricked me!

18:31.694 --> 18:33.404
Eep, you've put us all at risk.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.288
I was trying to win food
for the whole family.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.699
Relax, Dad.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.202
With you out, nothing can stand
between me and victory.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.871
[clapping]

18:41.954 --> 18:44.540
Well done, girl from my class.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.168
But aren't you overlooking me?

18:47.251 --> 18:49.003
[blows raspberry]
You?

18:49.086 --> 18:51.964
After all the torture I've been through,
what can you do?

18:52.048 --> 18:54.550
Ah, you've forgotten.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.802
I'm a master of torture.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.095
I'm a teacher.

18:58.179 --> 19:02.558
Now, class, gather round
for my very long-winded lesson

19:02.642 --> 19:06.395
on the history of dirt.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.190
[shrieking]

19:09.273 --> 19:11.651
- [yelping]
- [snarling]

19:14.654 --> 19:17.031
[yelling]

19:18.240 --> 19:20.368
- [grunting]
- [snarling]

19:20.451 --> 19:22.828
So this is how it ends.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.080
[growling]

19:29.335 --> 19:33.089
Mm?
[panting]

19:33.172 --> 19:34.172
Huh?

19:35.549 --> 19:36.801
[giggling]

19:36.884 --> 19:38.386
[gasps]
She likes them.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.262
She really likes them.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.183
Uh-oh, I think she's jammed.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.729
And when you add water to dirt,

19:48.813 --> 19:53.234
an exciting change happens, making...

19:53.317 --> 19:55.736
- [sighing]
- Thoughts, ideas?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.072
[moaning]

19:58.155 --> 20:01.450
Wrong!
The answer is wet dirt.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.827
[chuckling]

20:02.910 --> 20:06.747
Which brings us to the end...
of my introduction.

20:06.831 --> 20:07.915
Moving on...

20:07.998 --> 20:10.376
- You can do it, Eep.
- No, Dad.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.044
I gotta quit.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.797
I'm really not tough enough
to take this guy.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.465
Honey, you are tough.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.176
You're a Crood.
All Croods are tough.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.762
- Even Thunk?
- Of course not Thunk.

20:21.846 --> 20:24.056
Look, I didn't think you were
grown up enough for this,

20:24.140 --> 20:26.016
but you showed a lot of heart today.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.768
You even outlasted me.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.271
So I admit, I was wrong.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.106
Aw, Dad.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.525
Now how about you go
crush this windbag?

20:34.608 --> 20:36.861
So you may be asking,

20:36.944 --> 20:42.032
what is the difference
between rocky dirt and dirty rocks?

20:42.116 --> 20:43.451
Well, I...

20:44.368 --> 20:48.622
[grunting] Let's find out which of us has
what it takes to hold on.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.083
[screaming]

20:51.167 --> 20:53.210
Okay, careful!
Careful! Careful!

20:53.294 --> 20:54.378
Whoa!

20:54.462 --> 20:56.213
[yelling]
Oh, dear.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.297
Are you insane?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.800
- Stop this now.
- You stop it.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.261
- Just let go.
- Never!

21:02.344 --> 21:03.429
Pelt yourself.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.348
[screaming]

21:06.432 --> 21:08.392
- [grunting]
- Oh, no!

21:08.476 --> 21:09.476
Whoa!

21:09.518 --> 21:10.518
[screaming]

21:10.561 --> 21:11.479
Oh, no, not there!

21:11.562 --> 21:13.314
- [panting]
- [screaming]

21:16.233 --> 21:17.359
No! Don't!

21:18.569 --> 21:19.945
[screaming]

21:22.072 --> 21:23.616
[girelephant trumpeting]

21:25.075 --> 21:26.911
[moaning]

21:28.704 --> 21:30.498
[yelling]

21:31.165 --> 21:33.083
Okay, I'll let go.
Just make it stop.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.503
You want me to make us stop falling?

21:35.586 --> 21:37.087
You're saying you can't?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.589
[screams]

21:41.967 --> 21:43.844
I'm alive!

21:43.928 --> 21:46.555
And the egg is all mine.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.639
Ha!

21:47.681 --> 21:50.518
Um, pretty sure it's mine.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.312
[girelephant moaning]

21:55.564 --> 21:57.024
[groaning]

21:58.150 --> 22:01.946
[all]
Food, food, food, food, food!

22:02.029 --> 22:03.197
Here you go, Croods.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.281
Eat up.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.331
Great job on the egg, Eep.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.375
So what do you say?
Hunt with me tomorrow?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.292
[gasps]

22:15.376 --> 22:18.087
Thanks, Dad,
but there's absolutely no way.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.464
