WEBVTT

00:03.842 --> 00:06.968
Ick, ick, ick, ick, ick, ick, ick!

00:06.970 --> 00:10.280
Okay, something tells me I don't
want to know what's in there.

00:10.282 --> 00:12.151
It's my class tarantula.

00:14.178 --> 00:17.452
Oh, my God, I had this
exact nightmare last week.

00:17.454 --> 00:19.851
Y-You brought a tarantula into
the house and then the spider

00:19.853 --> 00:21.656
turned into Donatella
Versace, and she told me

00:21.658 --> 00:24.611
I was a fraud and
then my teeth fell out.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.707
Sorry, I had to bring her home

00:26.709 --> 00:28.715
because the school is getting fumigated.

00:28.717 --> 00:30.642
My fear of spiders is outweighed

00:30.644 --> 00:33.369
by my love of extra credit.

00:33.371 --> 00:36.289
Okay, well, does this
disgusting thing have a name?

00:36.291 --> 00:39.685
Tarantula Lansbury.

00:41.212 --> 00:43.762
My teacher thought it was so clever,

00:43.764 --> 00:46.207
but he's an old guy.

00:46.209 --> 00:48.708
I need to figure out what to feed it.

00:48.710 --> 00:51.310
Do you think Vanessa would
mind if I used her computer?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.406
No. Her password used
to be "Hugh Grant",

00:53.408 --> 00:55.671
but that was, like, ten years
ago, so I would hope by now

00:55.673 --> 00:57.214
- that she's moved on.
- I'm in.

00:59.457 --> 01:00.696
Hey, girls.

01:00.698 --> 01:01.858
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.365
Still can't figure out
the washing machine

01:03.367 --> 01:04.367
at your apartment?

01:05.921 --> 01:08.696
Whoa, whoa, who's this?

01:08.698 --> 01:10.740
Uh, that is Tarantula Lansbury.

01:10.742 --> 01:12.342
That's good.

01:14.346 --> 01:15.953
Uh-oh.

01:15.955 --> 01:17.789
I don't think I was
supposed to see this.

01:17.791 --> 01:19.082
That's probably 'cause you're using

01:19.084 --> 01:22.436
somebody's computer that's not yours.

01:22.438 --> 01:24.628
No, Vanessa wrote a letter withdrawing

01:24.630 --> 01:26.172
from the State Assembly race.

01:26.174 --> 01:27.590
What? She's not a quitter.

01:27.592 --> 01:29.008
I mean, she quit smoking,

01:29.010 --> 01:31.147
but nothing to get angry about.

01:31.149 --> 01:32.630
Yeah, but I don't get it.

01:32.632 --> 01:34.711
Mom is so passionate about education.

01:34.713 --> 01:38.017
I mean, she gave up on me, but still.

01:38.019 --> 01:40.451
Looks like just a draft,
but I'm surprised

01:40.453 --> 01:42.105
she never told me anything about it.

01:42.107 --> 01:45.334
When you do talk to her, don't
tell her I was on her computer.

01:45.336 --> 01:47.376
It's all right, we're on
your computer all the time.

01:50.946 --> 01:53.946
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

01:55.594 --> 01:57.909
- Hey.
- I'm so mad.

01:57.911 --> 02:01.393
The parking lot at the store
was jammed and then this woman

02:01.395 --> 02:04.252
zipped into a parking spot
that I was clearly waiting for.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.542
Why do you let people
do that to you, honey?

02:06.544 --> 02:08.256
Oh, I got her back. I gave her

02:08.258 --> 02:10.642
the "you know what you did" face.

02:12.887 --> 02:15.772
Oh, stop, that sends
chills up and down my spine,

02:15.774 --> 02:18.057
and I didn't even do anything
wrong that you know of.

02:19.745 --> 02:21.716
Okay, okay.

02:21.718 --> 02:24.132
Since you dragged it out of me...

02:24.134 --> 02:26.240
I-I saw what you were
doing on your computer.

02:26.242 --> 02:27.567
Oh, oh.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.360
How embarrassing, you know what?

02:29.362 --> 02:31.696
I just love videos

02:31.698 --> 02:33.067
of pandas sneezing.

02:35.148 --> 02:37.642
Well, you'd be a psychopath
if you didn't love that.

02:37.644 --> 02:39.452
No, I'm talking about this.

02:39.454 --> 02:41.831
You're thinking about
dropping out of the race?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.208
Mike, look.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.048
It just crossed my mind, okay?

02:47.050 --> 02:49.589
I mean, you got to admit,
things aren't going that great.

02:49.591 --> 02:52.234
So? You're not a quitter, Vanessa.

02:52.236 --> 02:53.666
You're the positive person.

02:53.668 --> 02:55.599
You're the one even
when the Broncos lose,

02:55.601 --> 02:58.106
say, "Look, at least
they had a good time".

02:58.108 --> 03:00.922
Well, look, I knew it was

03:00.924 --> 03:02.462
a long shot that I would win.

03:02.464 --> 03:05.325
I really, I just wanted to get
people talking about education.

03:05.327 --> 03:07.365
But I can't get anyone to listen!

03:07.367 --> 03:09.242
Well, you're not the
most forceful person.

03:09.244 --> 03:11.660
No, I tried. At the candidates' forum,

03:11.662 --> 03:13.467
I-I couldn't get anyone to call on me,

03:13.469 --> 03:15.757
and I must have raised my
hand at least a dozen times.

03:15.759 --> 03:17.617
Nobody's gonna listen to what
you have to say if you wait

03:17.619 --> 03:19.952
for them to call on you.

03:21.432 --> 03:23.164
Vanessa?

03:23.166 --> 03:25.082
Look, I get what you're saying,

03:25.084 --> 03:28.587
but all these other candidates
are not afraid to be loud,

03:28.589 --> 03:30.822
obnoxious and pushy to
get people's attention,

03:30.824 --> 03:33.057
and I-I'm not that person.

03:33.059 --> 03:35.261
It's too bad you can't
get advice from somebody

03:35.263 --> 03:37.553
who is loud, obnoxious and pushy.

03:37.555 --> 03:40.282
If you were married to
somebody like that...

03:40.284 --> 03:42.266
Hmm. How about you?

03:42.268 --> 03:44.619
Oh... perfect!

03:49.253 --> 03:52.111
Hey, guys, we got a new
ultrasound of the baby.

03:52.113 --> 03:53.144
- You want to see?
- Ooh.

03:53.146 --> 03:54.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh!

03:54.790 --> 03:58.045
- She looks just like Kristin.
- Aw...

03:58.047 --> 04:00.380
Yeah, like, if Kristin was tiny

04:00.382 --> 04:02.682
and trapped in some weird
balloon and her arm was coming

04:02.684 --> 04:04.731
out of her stomach and
there was all this goop...

04:04.733 --> 04:06.499
We get it, thank you.

04:06.501 --> 04:07.926
I-I got to get back to the Grill.

04:07.928 --> 04:09.769
Yeah, our coupons expire
tomorrow, so the place

04:09.771 --> 04:13.506
is crawling with old...
er, wiser people...

04:13.508 --> 04:16.050
- who love soup.
- Mm-hmm.

04:16.052 --> 04:18.177
I live for Wednesdays.

04:18.178 --> 04:21.264
Cream of potato.

04:21.266 --> 04:23.511
Uh, yeah, I got to get
back, too, actually.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.269
Marijuana does not sell itself.

04:26.271 --> 04:28.187
Yeah, actually, it kind of does.

04:28.189 --> 04:29.522
- Bye.
- All right,

04:29.524 --> 04:30.616
- see you guys.
- see you.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.066
- Love you.
- Love you.

04:32.068 --> 04:34.765
Hey, have, uh, you guys
gotten them a baby gift yet?

04:34.767 --> 04:36.070
Oh, I haven't, no.

04:36.072 --> 04:39.484
Hey, hey, Ed? Ed... what
about if the three of us

04:39.486 --> 04:41.117
go in together, get something special?

04:41.119 --> 04:42.660
Well, that's a great idea.

04:42.662 --> 04:44.120
I know exactly what to get.

04:44.122 --> 04:46.622
It's very high tech, very millennial.

04:46.624 --> 04:48.975
Great, uh, can we split it three ways?

04:48.977 --> 04:50.960
Well, it's north of two grand.

04:50.962 --> 04:52.345
Oh.

04:52.347 --> 04:54.064
Uh, is it okay if we get them something

04:54.066 --> 04:56.591
south of... 40 bucks?

04:58.386 --> 04:59.719
Yeah, what...

04:59.721 --> 05:01.437
what is this thing?

05:01.439 --> 05:03.208
Well, it's a Rock-a-Tot.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.096
It's a Swedish-made, smart bassinet.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.977
So, you operate it from your phone.

05:07.979 --> 05:11.573
It rocks the baby to sleep,
and even knows when it stirs.

05:11.575 --> 05:14.942
Well, for 2,000 bucks, it
better also wipe her butt.

05:18.406 --> 05:20.048
Wait, does it?

05:22.008 --> 05:25.658
If it did, I'd have one.

05:25.660 --> 05:29.351
No, no, look, I don't expect
you to split it equally with me,

05:29.353 --> 05:32.564
so why don't we each pay an
amount based on our salaries?

05:32.566 --> 05:35.671
All right, and of course, that
means I'll pay the most, so...

05:35.673 --> 05:37.902
All right, well, I guess that
means I pay the second most.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.802
Well, you don't know that.

05:39.804 --> 05:42.428
Maybe, uh, I pay the second most.

05:44.349 --> 05:46.265
I make a pretty penny.

05:47.602 --> 05:50.311
I get paid in dollars.

05:50.313 --> 05:52.572
- Okay, but...
- Okay, just stop, stop, stop...

05:52.574 --> 05:55.290
Let's not get into who makes
more money, gentlemen.

05:55.292 --> 05:56.749
I'll calculate what you owe,

05:56.751 --> 05:58.250
and then you pay the rest, all right?

05:58.252 --> 06:00.663
So, I'll-I'll tell
you separately, right?

06:00.665 --> 06:03.291
- How-how's that sound?
- Yeah, okay.

06:03.293 --> 06:04.676
Yeah, sounds good to me.

06:04.678 --> 06:06.118
I don't want my employees worried

06:06.120 --> 06:07.578
about who makes more money around here.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.872
Life is too short, all right?

06:09.874 --> 06:13.018
And you can't take it with you. Yeah.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.187
Although, I've got an
Egyptian guy working on that.

06:20.802 --> 06:22.635
This is so exciting.

06:22.637 --> 06:24.422
What a great idea to have Vanessa

06:24.424 --> 06:26.011
livestream from the house.

06:26.013 --> 06:27.911
Well, that's today's politics.

06:27.913 --> 06:30.206
People want to think that
they know who you are.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.229
It's like inviting people
into your own home.

06:33.231 --> 06:35.481
So, let's get rid of everything

06:35.483 --> 06:37.709
in the background that looks
like it's worth stealing.

06:41.381 --> 06:44.156
Okay, I have done my part, and

06:44.158 --> 06:46.705
if elections were decided by
who has the best fashion sense...

06:46.707 --> 06:48.355
and I believe they should be...

06:48.357 --> 06:50.913
- Mom would win by a landslide.
- Oh, honey.

06:50.915 --> 06:53.165
If I were 18, I would vote for you...

06:53.167 --> 06:55.185
and buy a cigar.

06:57.422 --> 06:59.617
Honey, I think you look great, you do.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.142
Oh, Dad, we should do your outfit now.

07:01.144 --> 07:02.581
- I'm not on camera.
- Yeah, I know.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.392
It's just been bugging
me for a long time.

07:06.472 --> 07:08.456
You know, honey, I have to admit,

07:08.458 --> 07:11.126
I was a little dubious when
you first brought this up,

07:11.128 --> 07:12.840
- but I'm-I'm kind of excited.
- Uh-huh.

07:12.842 --> 07:14.940
We're gonna show the Colorado voters

07:14.942 --> 07:16.325
- the real Vanessa Baxter.
- Okay.

07:16.327 --> 07:18.017
And none of the expensive lamps!

07:18.019 --> 07:19.734
Um...

07:19.736 --> 07:22.486
And, you-you really don't think
I should talk about the issues?

07:22.488 --> 07:23.571
No, no, no.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.406
Like Nixon did in 1960?

07:25.408 --> 07:27.386
Lost to Kennedy, 'cause he
was charming and handsome.

07:27.388 --> 07:29.285
- Any more questions?
- Yeah, I have one.

07:29.287 --> 07:31.662
Who is Nixon?

07:31.664 --> 07:35.392
I find it hard to
believe you're from here.

07:36.687 --> 07:40.069
- Okay.
- Listen, grab the lavalier mic,

07:40.071 --> 07:41.080
- and put it on her.
- Yeah.

07:41.082 --> 07:42.173
- I'll be right back.
- Good.

07:42.175 --> 07:43.674
- Okay, now, Mom?
- Yeah.

07:43.676 --> 07:45.436
Just remember not to do
anything embarrassing.

07:45.438 --> 07:46.630
You don't want to become a meme.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.987
Oh, memes are so cute.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.406
That housewife,

07:49.408 --> 07:51.542
she was so angry at that cat.

07:52.902 --> 07:55.895
Yeah, memes are cute
unless you're in them.

07:55.897 --> 07:58.355
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I didn't think about that, but...

07:58.357 --> 08:00.650
Like-like, that, um, that actress

08:00.652 --> 08:01.931
who yawned during an interview.

08:01.933 --> 08:04.111
People made memes like she
was screaming at babies.

08:04.113 --> 08:06.322
You mean she wasn't?

08:06.324 --> 08:09.450
I... I hated that lady.

08:09.452 --> 08:10.618
I know, right?

08:10.620 --> 08:13.329
Everybody did!

08:13.331 --> 08:16.055
Or that CEO who blinked.

08:16.057 --> 08:18.247
And the meme made it
look like he was sleeping.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.063
Right!

08:20.065 --> 08:22.578
They photoshopped him in
pajamas in a sleeping cap.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.507
His wife left him!

08:26.102 --> 08:28.509
Okay.

08:28.511 --> 08:30.617
Looks good, let's get this
show on the road, people.

08:30.619 --> 08:33.299
What?! What?! And-and be
mocked by the entire world?!

08:33.302 --> 08:34.643
No! No, not a chance in hell!

08:34.645 --> 08:35.775
No, no, not doing it!

08:35.778 --> 08:38.437
Nope, no!

08:38.438 --> 08:41.249
What was I gone... 30 seconds?

08:48.241 --> 08:50.467
Come on, come on, you're gonna be fine.

08:50.469 --> 08:52.618
Just breathe and relax.
The important thing is just,

08:52.620 --> 08:54.683
- just be yourself.
- No, I can't be comfortable.

08:54.685 --> 08:56.025
Look, the girls are right, I just,

08:56.027 --> 08:57.283
I don't want to be a laughingstock.

08:57.285 --> 08:58.632
No, Mom, look, don't worry.

08:58.634 --> 08:59.703
- You're gonna be great.
- Yeah.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.514
Just don't, you know, blink.

09:03.857 --> 09:05.780
The woman has to blink!

09:05.782 --> 09:07.388
Oh, no!

09:07.390 --> 09:09.050
Vanessa, do not do that.

09:09.052 --> 09:11.696
You're asking to get Home Alone-ed.

09:11.698 --> 09:14.024
Home Alone-ed?

09:14.026 --> 09:16.551
Don't listen to these
foolish, foolish girls.

09:16.553 --> 09:18.735
You're not gonna look stupid
because you're not stupid.

09:18.737 --> 09:20.578
- You're a champ, you are a champ.
- Okay, all right, yeah.

09:20.580 --> 09:21.772
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:21.774 --> 09:23.274
You're right, okay. I-I got this.

09:23.276 --> 09:24.649
Whoa! Definitely don't do that!

09:24.651 --> 09:26.192
The thumbs-up is, like, a sex thing now.

09:26.194 --> 09:28.404
What?! Ew!

09:28.406 --> 09:31.157
Get out, go. Go, get out.

09:31.159 --> 09:32.648
All right.

09:32.650 --> 09:34.034
- Just put them out of your mind.
- Okay.

09:34.036 --> 09:35.327
The girls were never here.

09:35.329 --> 09:36.537
- Mm-hmm, okay.
- Good, good?

09:36.539 --> 09:38.212
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, I got to do

09:38.214 --> 09:39.829
a quick sound check here on your mic,

09:39.831 --> 09:41.298
so I want you to just go over that

09:41.300 --> 09:42.794
intro we came up with, all right?

09:42.796 --> 09:45.130
Ready... and go.

09:51.512 --> 09:53.220
Hi.

09:53.222 --> 09:55.949
I am Vanessa Baxter,

09:55.951 --> 09:59.018
and I am running for
Colorado State Assembly.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.162
Welcome to my home.

10:03.625 --> 10:04.907
Okay.

10:04.909 --> 10:06.919
We got the sound check and...

10:06.921 --> 10:08.953
next we're gonna go live,

10:08.955 --> 10:12.590
and you're gonna want to act like
you actually are alive.

10:16.031 --> 10:17.780
Hey, man, you want a cup of coffee?

10:17.782 --> 10:19.406
Oh, yeah, thanks, Mr. Larabee.

10:19.408 --> 10:20.428
How do you take it?

10:20.430 --> 10:21.782
Oh, three caramels, whipped cream,

10:21.784 --> 10:23.718
and a cinnamon stick.

10:25.430 --> 10:27.138
Why don't I just let you get it?

10:27.140 --> 10:29.048
Oh...

10:29.050 --> 10:30.470
Gentlemen, a moment, please.

10:32.637 --> 10:35.585
- I did a little figuring based on what you make...
- Mm-hmm?

10:35.587 --> 10:38.177
... and here's what you
each owe for the baby gift.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.726
- Oh, okay.
- Great. Thanks, Mr. Alzate.

10:40.728 --> 10:42.228
Yeah, this was really a good idea.

10:42.230 --> 10:44.530
Now that I know what you both earn,

10:44.532 --> 10:47.950
you spend way too much time
standing around doing nothing.

10:57.506 --> 10:59.437
Did you just try and
look at my piece of paper?

10:59.439 --> 11:01.330
No, but you just tried to look at mine.

11:01.332 --> 11:03.140
I don't care what's on your paper.

11:03.142 --> 11:04.291
That is your business.

11:04.293 --> 11:07.419
Hmm, unless my business
is more than your business.

11:07.421 --> 11:10.297
Which it probably isn't.

11:10.299 --> 11:13.342
Okay. We both want to
know what each other has,

11:13.344 --> 11:15.344
so, count of three we show
each other the paper, deal?

11:15.346 --> 11:16.821
- Deal.
- Okay.

11:16.823 --> 11:20.224
One. Two.

11:20.226 --> 11:21.868
Three.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.324
I knew you weren't gonna do it.

11:26.326 --> 11:29.167
You didn't, either. Okay, go again.

11:29.169 --> 11:31.752
Okay. But for realsies.

11:33.614 --> 11:37.050
Okay. One. Two.

11:37.052 --> 11:38.450
Three.

11:38.452 --> 11:39.802
Oh...

11:42.548 --> 11:44.766
Seriously?

11:44.768 --> 11:47.218
All right, never mind. I'm out of here.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.136
Yeah, go get your stupid coffee!

11:49.138 --> 11:51.413
You know, actually, I think
I'll buy one in the Grill.

11:51.415 --> 11:53.299
- I can afford it.
- Hmm.

11:53.301 --> 11:56.694
So can I. I can afford two if I want!

12:00.571 --> 12:02.719
So, I hope that answers your question,

12:02.721 --> 12:04.488
Linda from Capitol Hill.

12:10.651 --> 12:14.445
We need to solve Colorado's
problems from top...

12:14.447 --> 12:15.880
Ooh!

12:21.796 --> 12:24.380
From top to bottom.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.542
If you want to hear more
of her stands on the issues,

12:28.544 --> 12:30.728
you can visit her website,
but today, we're gonna get

12:30.730 --> 12:32.267
a little more personal right now.

12:32.269 --> 12:34.200
Why don't you tell us about the time

12:34.202 --> 12:37.718
you and your daughters
ran out of gas up on I-70?

12:37.720 --> 12:40.113
Oh, that is quite a story, Mike.

12:43.142 --> 12:45.285
We ran out of gas...

12:48.665 --> 12:52.316
... and then we got more.

12:52.318 --> 12:55.712
Looks like we just lost
Linda from Capitol Hill.

12:57.365 --> 12:59.782
What we're gonna do now
is take a quick break,

12:59.784 --> 13:01.188
little five-minute break,

13:01.190 --> 13:03.327
give the voters of Colorado a chance

13:03.329 --> 13:05.746
to catch their breath. See you in five.

13:05.748 --> 13:07.998
Oh, we can do that?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Um, honey.

13:10.002 --> 13:11.932
We're not on right now. You can relax.

13:11.934 --> 13:13.679
No, I don't, I don't want to relax.

13:13.681 --> 13:15.732
I-I need to keep my energy up.

13:17.009 --> 13:20.851
You know, an oil
painting has more energy

13:20.853 --> 13:22.137
than you have right now.

13:22.139 --> 13:24.431
I'm sorry, Michael. Just blame Mandy.

13:24.433 --> 13:25.907
Look, I-I don't want to be a joke.

13:25.909 --> 13:27.693
I'm going to the bathroom. I... Great.

13:27.695 --> 13:30.496
Oh, boy.

13:32.817 --> 13:35.275
It's going great, Mr. Baxter.

13:35.277 --> 13:36.881
What part of this is going great to you?

13:36.883 --> 13:39.488
The part where she
actually moved her face?

13:39.490 --> 13:42.133
On the bright side,
I don't think anybody

13:42.135 --> 13:44.552
is going to remember this.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.512
Hmm.

13:46.514 --> 13:50.391
You know, I think I have a way
for people to remember this.

13:57.284 --> 13:59.399
Ooh, what's that?

13:59.401 --> 14:00.777
It's just a little
special effect for later.

14:00.779 --> 14:03.904
- Special effect?
- Don't touch that! You're back in five. Okay.

14:03.906 --> 14:06.942
Ready? Four, three, two,

14:06.944 --> 14:09.226
one. All right.

14:09.228 --> 14:11.145
Our hour's almost up,
so let's pick up the pace

14:11.147 --> 14:12.423
- a little bit.
- What does that mean?

14:12.425 --> 14:13.605
Word association.

14:13.607 --> 14:15.500
Family.

14:16.569 --> 14:19.236
Uh, good.

14:19.238 --> 14:20.671
Commitment.

14:24.076 --> 14:26.076
Also good.

14:26.078 --> 14:28.427
- All right, third word.
- All right, stop.

14:28.429 --> 14:29.888
Stop. What are you doing with this mug?

14:29.890 --> 14:31.457
- Oh, spider!
- There.

14:31.459 --> 14:32.541
Girls!

14:32.543 --> 14:34.502
Get in here and get this thing!

14:34.504 --> 14:36.038
Oh, make Jen do it.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.855
You're wearing oven mitts.

14:37.857 --> 14:40.674
Stop it. Just relax. Look,
he's perfectly harmless.

14:40.676 --> 14:42.926
I think he's peeing on me!

14:42.928 --> 14:45.220
Why the hell would you do that?

14:45.222 --> 14:47.412
What? You're not afraid of spiders.

14:47.414 --> 14:50.618
No. No, you know, I'll tell
you what I am scared of. Them.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.134
Them, the trolls
who-who don't really care

14:53.136 --> 14:55.046
about what our kids are
going through at school.

14:55.048 --> 14:56.410
You know, all they care about

14:56.412 --> 14:58.441
are goofy pictures on the Internet.

14:58.443 --> 14:59.691
So, you know what? You go ahead.

14:59.693 --> 15:00.928
You go ahead, and you make a meme

15:00.930 --> 15:02.356
of me holding a spider.

15:02.358 --> 15:04.306
And while you're at it,
uh, here's me blinking.

15:04.308 --> 15:06.617
And-and here's me yawning.

15:06.619 --> 15:09.637
And then there, whatever this means.

15:10.789 --> 15:12.089
I'm Vanessa Baxter,

15:12.091 --> 15:13.891
and I'm wishing you a good night.

15:18.923 --> 15:20.297
If you'd like to learn more

15:20.299 --> 15:22.132
about this candidate's positions,

15:22.134 --> 15:26.321
just go to VanessaBaxterForAssembly.com.

15:26.323 --> 15:28.114
Baxters out.

15:31.477 --> 15:33.411
Come in.

15:33.413 --> 15:36.178
- Watch it, guys. Come on. Easy does it.
- Hey.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.745
- Hey.
- Whoa, what's this?

15:37.747 --> 15:39.366
Uh, well, the three of
us got you and Kristin

15:39.368 --> 15:40.978
a little something for the baby.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.865
Guys, thank you so much.

15:42.867 --> 15:44.826
That is totally unnecessary.
I mean, not that we don't...

15:44.828 --> 15:46.483
O-Okay, okay, y-yeah,
yeah. Just, uh, tell me

15:46.485 --> 15:48.292
where to put it so I don't get a hernia.

15:48.294 --> 15:49.701
All right, here we go.

15:49.703 --> 15:50.762
- Easy there.
- Whoa.

15:50.764 --> 15:52.588
- I got it.
- Uh, oh, let me go get Kris.

15:52.590 --> 15:54.651
There you go.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.751
Oh, I have a check for you, Mr. Alzate.

15:56.753 --> 15:58.352
- Oh. Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
- Okay.

15:58.354 --> 15:59.479
Yeah.

15:59.481 --> 16:01.797
All right.

16:01.799 --> 16:04.592
What? Are you-you afraid
I'm gonna look at your check?

16:04.594 --> 16:06.984
Uh, yeah. I wasn't
born yesterday, Chuck.

16:06.986 --> 16:09.530
That would make me a baby.

16:09.532 --> 16:12.821
Are you two dummies still
on this? Give me those.

16:12.823 --> 16:15.204
Are you still worried about
who makes more money?

16:15.206 --> 16:16.237
Maybe a little.

16:16.239 --> 16:18.006
I'm not. 'Cause I probably make more.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.147
Probably don't.

16:19.149 --> 16:21.534
Okay, fine. Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

16:21.536 --> 16:23.527
All right, here. Here. Chuck's check.

16:23.529 --> 16:25.153
Here's Kyle's.

16:25.155 --> 16:27.840
All right, go ahead. Go ahead.

16:29.959 --> 16:32.545
What are you waiting for?
Don't you want to know?

16:32.547 --> 16:34.222
- I do.
- I do more.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.845
Wait, they're the same amount.

16:37.847 --> 16:39.399
What, what, so, we make the same money?

16:39.401 --> 16:41.086
I don't know. Do you
really think I know how

16:41.088 --> 16:44.152
to look up how much you make
on the company database?

16:44.154 --> 16:48.427
I can't even close out a game
of solitaire I started in 2008.

16:48.429 --> 16:51.360
Wow.

16:51.362 --> 16:53.779
Yeah, well, now I feel kind of stupid.

16:53.781 --> 16:56.059
Well, you should.

16:56.061 --> 16:58.946
You know, I'm a really wealthy man.

16:58.948 --> 17:01.565
And there's two things
I've learned in life.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.840
One: if you can...

17:04.843 --> 17:06.276
be very wealthy.

17:07.865 --> 17:09.330
And two:

17:09.333 --> 17:13.085
never compare yourself
to someone based on money.

17:13.087 --> 17:16.180
The most important thing in
life is a person's character.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.268
And you both have equal amounts of that.

17:22.421 --> 17:25.714
I'm sorry, Chuck.

17:25.715 --> 17:27.766
Me, too, buddy.

17:27.768 --> 17:29.610
For realsies.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.597
- Hey, guys. Wow, this is nice.
- Oh.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.783
- What?
- Yeah, I thought we could both, um...

17:37.019 --> 17:38.953
... open it together?

17:40.569 --> 17:43.593
- Uh, what? A Rock-a-Tot?
- What?

17:43.595 --> 17:45.896
You guys, this-this gift is amazing.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.462
Well, it's for two people we love

17:47.464 --> 17:49.046
and one person we're going to love.

17:49.048 --> 17:50.238
- Oh!
- Guys, th...

17:50.240 --> 17:52.115
- I mean, this is really expensive.
- Yeah.

17:52.117 --> 17:54.545
Money. Who cares about money?

17:54.547 --> 17:56.620
Besides, we-we split it.

17:56.622 --> 17:59.247
Mm-hmm. But not evenly, of course.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.643
I make a lot more
money than these chumps,

18:01.645 --> 18:04.559
so it's mostly from me.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.130
- Uncle Ed. Oh, we love you.
- That's all right.

18:15.140 --> 18:16.482
Just open it slowly.

18:16.484 --> 18:18.015
I don't want to open
it, Jen. You open it.

18:18.017 --> 18:19.101
- You open it.
- You open it.

18:19.103 --> 18:20.219
- You open it.
- I'm not gonna open it.

18:20.221 --> 18:21.697
- You open...
- Is Vanessa back yet?

18:21.699 --> 18:23.346
Not yet.

18:23.348 --> 18:25.212
Boy, she seemed pretty mad.

18:25.214 --> 18:29.328
All she said was,
"I'm going for a walk".

18:29.330 --> 18:31.546
That's what she does when she's upset.

18:31.548 --> 18:33.591
The more upset she is,
the further she walks.

18:33.593 --> 18:37.577
One time, I had to go
pick her up in Wyoming.

18:37.579 --> 18:39.430
That was my fault.

18:40.633 --> 18:43.311
I'm sorry the livestream
was such a disaster.

18:43.313 --> 18:44.755
I don't think it was a disaster,

18:44.757 --> 18:47.212
and not just 'cause it was my idea.

18:47.214 --> 18:49.339
She wanted to get some attention,

18:49.341 --> 18:51.758
she got said attention.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.694
Yeah, I don't think Mom's
gonna see it that way.

18:54.696 --> 18:56.822
Oh, hell yes!

18:56.824 --> 18:58.774
Hey, honey. Look, look, look.

18:58.776 --> 19:00.561
Did you see my website?
Look at this. Look at this.

19:00.563 --> 19:03.488
It's blowing up. Thousands of comments.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.373
Donations are pouring
in, and look at this.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.998
Linda from Capitol Hill
sent in a hundred bucks.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.025
- Ah.
- Right?

19:09.027 --> 19:11.584
I always liked that woman.

19:11.586 --> 19:13.818
So, you're not worried
about becoming a meme.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.522
Oh, no, I-I already am. No, look, look.

19:16.524 --> 19:18.588
Here's a picture of me with the spider,

19:18.590 --> 19:21.399
and it says, "This is
what badass looks like".

19:21.401 --> 19:23.382
Right? And then over here, look.

19:23.384 --> 19:25.194
Here, this one says, uh,

19:25.196 --> 19:28.128
"What has ten legs and my vote?"

19:28.130 --> 19:30.213
Here's one that says,

19:30.215 --> 19:33.109
"She puts the 'rack' in arachnid".

19:34.320 --> 19:36.278
Gross.

19:38.557 --> 19:40.232
Hey, that's me!

19:40.234 --> 19:42.058
Wait.

19:42.060 --> 19:45.329
They made me into the
Crazy Oven Mitt Lady?

19:46.738 --> 19:48.334
You know, honey, you got to be careful

19:48.336 --> 19:50.609
with what you put on the Internet.

19:50.611 --> 19:53.007
You just have to work with someone

19:53.009 --> 19:54.740
who knows what they're doing.

19:54.742 --> 19:56.448
Thank you.

19:56.450 --> 19:58.551
Aw, kiss of the Spider Woman.

19:59.712 --> 20:01.620
I hope not. You know,

20:01.622 --> 20:05.516
female spiders kill
the male after mating.

20:05.518 --> 20:09.520
Yeah, but, you know,
that's-that's, like, afterwards.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.396
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man

20:19.398 --> 20:21.904
talking about arachnids. Spiders.

20:21.906 --> 20:23.495
I've traveled throughout the world

20:23.497 --> 20:26.910
and seen hundreds of the
estimated 35,000 species.

20:26.912 --> 20:30.900
They can be big, little,
poisonous, jump high,

20:30.902 --> 20:33.923
but one thing all
spiders are is authentic.

20:33.925 --> 20:36.389
You push 'em, they push back.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.784
If you push up against a
Brazilian, uh, wandering spider?

20:40.786 --> 20:44.112
You might want to wander into
an emergency room.

20:44.114 --> 20:47.313
Spiders have very poor
eyesight, you know?

20:47.315 --> 20:49.278
Unlike the Feds, who have a lot of eyes

20:49.280 --> 20:50.542
and can see your hard-earned money

20:50.544 --> 20:52.115
no matter where you put it.

20:52.117 --> 20:55.550
You got to love the
female spiders. Yeah.

20:55.552 --> 20:58.445
They often begin eating the
male during sex.

20:58.447 --> 21:00.512
You know, he knew what
he was getting into,

21:00.514 --> 21:02.239
but he died doing what he loved.

21:03.852 --> 21:06.450
Look, big females eat their puny mates

21:06.452 --> 21:08.764
(simply because A)
They're hungry. Right?

21:08.766 --> 21:11.086
(B) They can.

21:11.088 --> 21:13.069
Love 'em or hate 'em, you never wonder

21:13.071 --> 21:14.609
if spiders are being straight with you.

21:14.611 --> 21:17.471
Maybe our leaders should
take a lesson from spiders

21:17.473 --> 21:19.495
instead of, I don't know, snakes?

21:19.497 --> 21:22.188
Politicians like to come
up with ways to convince us

21:22.190 --> 21:23.805
that they're being honest with us.

21:23.807 --> 21:25.933
Here's an idea. Why
don't you tell the truth?

21:25.935 --> 21:28.441
Maybe we should be like spiders

21:28.443 --> 21:31.552
and let the women run things, huh? Yeah.

21:31.554 --> 21:34.188
Just be sure to avoid 'em,
you know, when they're hungry.

21:36.059 --> 21:37.409
Baxter out.
