Please!
Help me! Help me!

02:04.491 --> 02:06.193
Please!

02:46.699 --> 02:48.468
Thanks.
Yeah.

02:49.468 --> 02:51.535
So what's left?

02:51.536 --> 02:53.370
Well, we've got
all the camping gear.

02:53.371 --> 02:55.039
You've got your
camera stuff, right?

02:55.040 --> 02:56.174
Yeah, it's in the truck.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.143
Well, then looks like all
we got left are the girls.

02:58.144 --> 03:00.145
Are they ready?

03:00.146 --> 03:02.150
Yeah, I just called.
Told them we're on our way.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.286
Sounds good.
Hey, Will.

03:07.286 --> 03:08.986
Yeah?

03:08.987 --> 03:10.288
I really appreciate you coming
out on this trip with us.

03:10.289 --> 03:12.524
Oh, it's no problem, man.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.294
So we gonna have fun, or what?

03:16.294 --> 03:17.461
I guess.

03:17.462 --> 03:20.264
Come on, man,
are we gonna have fun?

03:20.265 --> 03:22.032
You know it.
Well, let's hit it!

04:18.120 --> 04:20.192
Um... Is Brooke here?

04:23.193 --> 04:25.231
I'm sorry.
You must be Kyle.

04:28.231 --> 04:31.600
We couldn't have chosen a more rainy day.
This weather, huh?

04:31.601 --> 04:33.437
Brooke!
If I had nickel for every time...

04:34.437 --> 04:35.307
Right.

04:38.307 --> 04:40.208
Looks like you two hit it off.

04:40.209 --> 04:41.809
Yeah.

04:41.810 --> 04:44.612
He almost caught me sneaking her
out of the house in high school.

04:44.613 --> 04:47.086
Apparently he hasn't
forgotten about it.

04:50.086 --> 04:51.456
Hey, whoa!

04:53.456 --> 04:55.222
Hey, Jenna.
Hey, James.

04:55.223 --> 04:57.359
Will, you know Jenna, right?
Yeah. Of course.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.094
Hi.

04:59.095 --> 05:01.067
All packed up?
Yeah, yeah, just one second.

05:04.067 --> 05:06.434
That was a pretty
enthusiastic greeting.

05:06.435 --> 05:08.203
What're you talking about?

05:08.204 --> 05:09.406
Whoa!

05:11.406 --> 05:13.275
You two still have
something going on?

05:13.276 --> 05:14.442
Maybe. Why?

05:14.443 --> 05:16.344
Don't bullshit me.
I'm not. I'm not bullshitting you.

05:16.345 --> 05:18.513
You're doing that face
you do when you lie.

05:19.513 --> 05:21.383
Okay. All right.
It's a small thing.

05:21.384 --> 05:23.558
Let's not make it into
a big thing, okay?

05:29.558 --> 05:31.192
What the hell is he doing?

05:31.193 --> 05:32.426
I'm so sorry.

05:32.427 --> 05:35.566
You can't be serious.
He fucking hates me.

05:37.566 --> 05:39.301
You... You didn't tell
about us, did you?

05:39.302 --> 05:41.135
You serious?
He'd freak out.

05:41.136 --> 05:43.137
We've got it under control.

05:43.138 --> 05:45.139
Daddy didn't know
that Will was going.

05:45.140 --> 05:47.342
He's not too fond of you, Will.

05:48.342 --> 05:49.544
Great.

05:50.544 --> 05:52.616
Chill. Just chill.

05:55.615 --> 05:57.353
It's okay.

06:00.353 --> 06:01.456
Hey.

06:02.456 --> 06:03.293
Heard you're coming along?

06:06.293 --> 06:08.527
Yeah.

06:08.562 --> 06:09.231
All right.

06:11.231 --> 06:12.218
It's good to have you, man.

06:31.218 --> 06:35.220
Will, what brings you along?

06:35.221 --> 06:37.390
Well, James asked me to come
along and take some photos

06:37.391 --> 06:39.426
while you guys
conduct your interview.

06:40.426 --> 06:42.394
Interview?
What interview?

06:42.395 --> 06:43.494
That's what
we're doing actually.

06:43.495 --> 06:45.465
We're going to Madison County
to interview an author.

06:46.465 --> 06:48.467
Why?

06:48.468 --> 06:50.535
Well, I've been writing letters
back and forth with this guy

06:50.536 --> 06:51.737
for a few weeks now.

06:51.738 --> 06:54.606
He invited us out to interview
him for my thesis paper.

06:54.607 --> 06:56.607
I thought we'd make
a trip out of it.

06:56.775 --> 06:59.310
There's a lot of controversy
around the book actually.

06:59.311 --> 07:02.583
It's about a guy
named Damien Ewell.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.250
According to the author,
David Randall,

07:06.251 --> 07:10.322
he killed around 33 people over the
course of a couple of decades.

07:10.323 --> 07:12.257
No one in the town told anyone.

07:12.258 --> 07:13.692
Is this true?

07:13.693 --> 07:15.661
David Randall claims it is.

07:15.662 --> 07:18.430
But no one believes him, right?

07:18.431 --> 07:19.765
I'm not sure. I mean,
that's part of the interview.

07:19.766 --> 07:22.533
I want to get the people's point
of view on the whole situation.

07:22.534 --> 07:24.968
So about how far away is this?

07:24.969 --> 07:27.338
It's a good half day drive.

07:27.339 --> 07:28.673
The only way to get to it
is through the hills,

07:28.674 --> 07:31.509
so lots of twists, and turns.

07:31.510 --> 07:32.714
Hope nobody
gets motion sickness.

07:50.628 --> 07:52.429
I guess this is a good chance
to get out and stretch

07:52.430 --> 07:53.632
if anyone needs to.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.398
Anybody need anything to drink?

07:55.399 --> 07:56.601
I'll take a water.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.436
Water. Anybody else?

07:58.437 --> 07:59.572
All good.

07:59.573 --> 08:03.614
How about you, Kyle? You
want a hotdog or something?

08:09.614 --> 08:11.458
Thank you.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.342
Who's that?

08:39.342 --> 08:41.410
You need a jump?

08:41.412 --> 08:44.280
No, sir. We're just waiting on our
friend over here to get his sea legs.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.483
Oh, I see.

08:46.483 --> 08:48.617
Where are you headed?

08:48.618 --> 08:50.454
We're actually headed
to Madison County.

08:51.454 --> 08:52.855
What're you doing going there?

08:52.856 --> 08:55.056
Well, we're gonna write
this, like, paper...

08:55.057 --> 08:59.328
We're actually headed that
way to get to the Mulberry.

08:59.329 --> 09:00.431
Gonna do some canoeing.

09:01.431 --> 09:02.365
Oh.

09:03.365 --> 09:04.665
Where are your canoes?

09:05.701 --> 09:08.337
Uh, we're gonna rent 'em
down at the entrance.

09:08.338 --> 09:09.440
Smart man.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.676
Yes, sir.

09:12.676 --> 09:14.086
All right, y'all take care.

09:24.085 --> 09:27.387
You know, there's a road
that you could take

09:27.388 --> 09:29.559
just before the 16.

09:30.559 --> 09:32.660
Save you almost 30 minutes.

09:32.661 --> 09:34.395
Oh, yeah?

09:34.396 --> 09:36.530
Yeah, and it's not
as hilly either.

09:36.531 --> 09:39.569
Be good for your
friend over there.

09:40.569 --> 09:42.669
It's called Pettigrew.

09:42.670 --> 09:44.671
All right, I appreciate that.

09:44.672 --> 09:46.406
No problem.

09:46.407 --> 09:48.678
Y'all take care.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.794
So, how'd you get
a hold of this guy?

10:08.795 --> 10:12.399
Well, I contacted him from the
address on the back of the book.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.900
But it took him a while
to get back to me.

10:14.901 --> 10:16.704
Does he write you often?

10:17.704 --> 10:19.606
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

10:19.607 --> 10:21.908
I mean, it usually
takes him a few days

10:21.909 --> 10:23.578
to get back to me
each time though.

10:24.578 --> 10:28.582
Why don't you just
e-mail, call?

10:28.583 --> 10:30.719
I would, but he doesn't
have a phone or a computer.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.588
God, that's gotta be awful.

10:35.589 --> 10:36.759
Can you imagine the privacy?

10:41.862 --> 10:43.896
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

10:43.897 --> 10:46.802
Do you want me to come with you?
No, I'm a big girl.

10:47.801 --> 10:49.540
I can go by myself.

10:54.540 --> 10:58.479
So, James, are you finally
going to make your move?

10:59.479 --> 11:01.647
What are you talking about?

11:01.648 --> 11:03.750
Oh, my God, don't play dumb.
She's into you.

11:04.750 --> 11:05.754
Really? What'd she say?

11:07.754 --> 11:10.755
Hey, I can't break
the code of girl talk.

11:10.756 --> 11:13.993
But I definitely think
she likes you.

11:13.994 --> 11:15.795
Don't act like it's some
kind of surprise, okay?

11:15.796 --> 11:16.764
Yeah.

11:18.764 --> 11:20.568
So, what's the plan
for tomorrow?

11:21.568 --> 11:22.471
Kyle.

11:25.471 --> 11:26.570
No, no, it's fine.

11:26.571 --> 11:27.439
Well, when we get into town,

11:27.440 --> 11:29.007
we're gonna talk
to some of the people

11:29.008 --> 11:30.542
before going out
to David's place.

11:30.543 --> 11:31.680
There. Happy?

11:34.680 --> 11:36.547
So. About Jenna.

11:36.548 --> 11:38.983
I really think that
you should just...

11:38.984 --> 11:41.518
What're you guys talking about?

11:41.519 --> 11:42.490
Nothing.

11:44.490 --> 11:45.290
Do it.

13:26.790 --> 13:28.890
Thanks. Thanks for the help.
You're...

13:28.891 --> 13:31.894
Ow! What the...
Hell, my...

13:38.166 --> 13:41.803
Hey, James.
Yes, ma'am?

13:41.804 --> 13:44.606
I was wondering, you
didn't happen to notice

13:44.607 --> 13:47.042
anyone else here camping
last night, did you?

13:47.043 --> 13:48.044
No. Not that
I know of. Why?

13:49.044 --> 13:49.814
No reason.

13:52.814 --> 13:55.148
It's just I saw a car leaving
earlier this morning.

13:55.149 --> 13:56.788
It looked like the one
from last night.

13:58.788 --> 14:00.922
Well, we are still kind
of close to the highway.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.790
I know.

14:02.791 --> 14:04.727
You don't think that guy had
any bad intentions yesterday,

14:04.728 --> 14:06.660
do you?

14:06.661 --> 14:07.899
Nah, he seemed friendly enough.

14:09.899 --> 14:11.067
I figure if he was going
to do us any harm,

14:11.068 --> 14:13.201
he would've done it last night.

14:13.202 --> 14:16.193
Yeah, you're probably right.

14:38.192 --> 14:40.860
Hey! What the
fuck are you doing?

14:40.861 --> 14:43.097
Oh, what you thought I was
actually going to take that road?

14:43.098 --> 14:44.331
Why not?

14:44.332 --> 14:46.966
What are the chances of that
guy telling us it's faster,

14:46.967 --> 14:48.703
we take it and then
get completely lost?

14:49.703 --> 14:50.862
You've got a point.

15:14.861 --> 15:17.229
So, Kyle, do you
have a girlfriend?

15:17.230 --> 15:18.964
No.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.033
No, no, don't let him fool you.

15:20.034 --> 15:22.734
He's got lots of lady friends.

15:22.735 --> 15:23.868
Who knows, Kyle,
maybe we can find you

15:23.869 --> 15:25.841
a little hillbilly girl to
hang out with out here, huh?

15:28.841 --> 15:30.244
What about you, Brooke?

15:31.244 --> 15:34.847
No. No boyfriend for me
at the moment.

15:34.848 --> 15:36.149
I'm probably going
to grad school.

15:36.150 --> 15:38.153
You know, trying to
keep my options open.

15:39.153 --> 15:41.757
Really?
Yeah, why?

15:44.757 --> 15:48.026
Just never really
talked about that.

15:48.027 --> 15:50.801
Well, it's something that I've
been thinking about by myself.

15:55.801 --> 15:57.956
Hey can you pull over soon?
I have to pee.

16:17.956 --> 16:20.925
Hey, I'm gonna go
in those trees.

16:20.926 --> 16:22.161
I'm gonna come keep a look out.

16:22.162 --> 16:23.961
No. No, no.
I'll be fine.

16:23.962 --> 16:25.298
I'll be within earshot.

16:26.298 --> 16:28.083
Got to take a piss anyway.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.051
Oh, there we go.

16:50.021 --> 16:52.021
Oh, come on, man!

16:52.022 --> 16:54.225
Oh, no, don't "come
on" me, that's cute.

16:55.227 --> 16:56.894
Go on.

16:56.895 --> 16:59.031
There we go. Oh!

17:00.031 --> 17:01.000
Okay, rub his belly.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.035
Okay, now go lower.

17:04.035 --> 17:04.968
Just kidding.

17:04.969 --> 17:07.137
Wonderful work,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:07.137 --> 17:10.773
Those ought to be good.
Maybe.

17:10.775 --> 17:13.142
Just because
he's a good photographer.

17:13.143 --> 17:14.244
So, what's the story with Will?

17:14.246 --> 17:16.012
He seems like a nice guy.

17:16.012 --> 17:18.915
Oh, he's a great guy.
We met in high school.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.949
Always had a camera
in his hand.

17:20.950 --> 17:23.018
Yeah, you two seem to
be really good friends.

17:23.019 --> 17:24.123
Yeah, we are.

17:27.123 --> 17:30.260
Well, it was actually his idea to
come out here and take pictures

17:30.261 --> 17:31.166
to go with my thesis.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.267
Pretty interesting, huh?

17:37.267 --> 17:39.267
Not really.

18:08.832 --> 18:10.100
Hey, Brooke, you ready?

18:29.917 --> 18:31.321
Holy shit!

18:32.321 --> 18:33.420
What was that?

18:33.421 --> 18:35.056
I'm sorry, baby.

18:35.057 --> 18:36.322
I just thought we'd have
a little bit of fun

18:36.323 --> 18:38.195
while we're out here
in the middle of nowhere.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.630
That's not exactly the
kind of fun I had in mind.

18:42.631 --> 18:44.898
What kind of fun
did you have in mind?

18:44.899 --> 18:47.201
Do you wanna fuck
right here in the woods?

18:47.202 --> 18:50.307
Uh-huh. You know,
I do have the camera.

18:52.307 --> 18:54.207
Uh-huh.
Mmm.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.342
Psych.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.078
What do you mean, psych?

18:57.079 --> 18:59.647
What? Is it the rain?
You fell for it. Yes.

18:59.648 --> 19:00.549
It's too wet to do that here.

19:00.550 --> 19:03.885
It can get a lot wetter out here.
Ah!

19:03.886 --> 19:05.653
What? What the fuck?

19:05.654 --> 19:07.654
- Come on.
- What was that?

19:08.657 --> 19:10.022
What was what?

19:10.023 --> 19:12.925
I heard a noise.
Hang on.

19:12.926 --> 19:16.463
Will, I heard a noise.
I didn't hear anything.

19:16.464 --> 19:18.031
What the fuck were you
doing with my sister?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.331
Kyle, stop!

19:19.332 --> 19:20.432
Were you spying on her?

19:20.433 --> 19:21.668
No, this isn't what
it looks like.

19:21.669 --> 19:23.235
No, Kyle!
Come on. Stop!

19:23.236 --> 19:24.472
No, I wasn't.
Let me see your camera.

19:24.473 --> 19:26.039
Why?
Because I want to see the camera.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.375
Why?
I want to see the fucking camera.

19:27.376 --> 19:29.209
Let me see
the goddamn pictures.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.510
I'll show you the pictures.
Stop it.

19:30.677 --> 19:32.244
Give me the fucking camera.
Stop it!

19:32.245 --> 19:34.947
Ahhh!
Whoa! Whoa! What happened?

19:34.948 --> 19:36.181
This fucking pervert
was spying,

19:36.182 --> 19:38.152
probably taking
pictures of Brooke.

19:38.153 --> 19:39.351
No, I wasn't.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.987
You know what?
This guy is fucking nuts.

19:40.988 --> 19:43.056
You're fucking kidding me.
Hey! Hey!

19:43.057 --> 19:45.925
Kyle, chill.
Will wouldn't do that.

19:45.926 --> 19:47.227
I don't know, what the
fuck he would do.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.495
Will's my boyfriend, Kyle!
All right?

19:49.496 --> 19:50.999
We've been seeing
each other for months.

19:51.998 --> 19:53.267
What... What?

19:54.267 --> 19:55.938
It's true. You need
to chill out, Kyle.

19:58.938 --> 20:00.472
Let's just drop it, okay?

20:00.473 --> 20:02.475
There's no sense in getting
pissed at each other.

20:03.475 --> 20:05.043
Let's get back to the car.

20:05.044 --> 20:06.292
We've gotta keep moving.

20:20.292 --> 20:21.292
- Fuck!
- You okay?

21:17.347 --> 21:20.586
Phew! You really know how to pick
a place, you know that, James?

21:22.586 --> 21:26.125
So, we're here now.
Where do we go?

21:27.125 --> 21:30.027
Hungry?
Starving.

21:30.028 --> 21:31.194
Let's stop and get some food.

21:31.195 --> 21:33.282
If we can find a place.

22:31.354 --> 22:34.298
Why is everyone staring at us?
I don't know.

22:42.297 --> 22:43.699
Hi, ma'am.
Hi there, young man.

22:44.699 --> 22:46.534
What can I do for you?

22:46.535 --> 22:48.403
We were wondering if we
could get some food?

22:48.404 --> 22:51.343
Certainly. What would you like?
Just whatever.

22:54.343 --> 22:56.680
Burgers, fries, and sodas for all 5 of us.
Of course.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.585
Uh, ma'am, do you
have veggie burgers?

23:03.585 --> 23:05.320
She's a vegetarian.

23:05.321 --> 23:06.653
No, I'm sorry.

23:06.654 --> 23:09.558
We don't get many
of those around here.

23:10.558 --> 23:13.160
I'll just have some fries.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.431
That'll be $15.

23:16.431 --> 23:17.735
What? That's it?

23:19.735 --> 23:21.235
Thank you.

23:21.236 --> 23:24.170
Let me ask you something.

23:24.171 --> 23:26.243
Why does everyone here
have a staring problem?

23:28.243 --> 23:29.443
Well, it's because

23:29.444 --> 23:31.716
we don't get many
strangers around here.

23:34.716 --> 23:35.718
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

23:37.718 --> 23:39.486
Well, there are a lot of folks

23:39.487 --> 23:41.456
who don't like people
they don't know

23:41.457 --> 23:43.489
around them and their families,

23:43.490 --> 23:45.525
and farms and such.

23:45.526 --> 23:47.294
Jeez, paranoid much?

23:47.295 --> 23:48.462
Well, we mean you no harm.

23:48.463 --> 23:50.597
No. I'm sure.

23:50.598 --> 23:52.533
Why don't you kids have a seat.

23:52.534 --> 23:54.408
Your food will be ready
in a few minutes.

24:00.408 --> 24:03.208
So, ma'am...
Erma.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.777
Erma. Uh, you wouldn't
happen to know

24:05.778 --> 24:07.647
David Randall would you?

24:07.648 --> 24:10.283
David Randall... Hmm.

24:10.284 --> 24:13.386
Nope. Sorry,
doesn't ring a bell.

24:13.387 --> 24:16.524
Well, he's the writer of this
book, Devil in the Woods.

24:17.524 --> 24:20.228
Oh, that David Randall.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.330
Yes, ma'am. What can
you tell me about him?

24:24.331 --> 24:25.669
He's long gone,
as far as I know.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.638
What about Damien Ewell?

24:32.639 --> 24:36.242
Oh, Damien Ewell's
just a made-up person.

24:36.243 --> 24:38.679
Doesn't exist,
just like that book.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.614
But the letters.
I've been getting letters.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.482
Oh!

24:44.483 --> 24:47.351
Someone was
playing a prank on you.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.564
All right. Thanks.

24:59.564 --> 25:01.366
So, what'd she say?

25:01.367 --> 25:03.370
She says, David isn't here
and Damien isn't real.

25:05.370 --> 25:06.503
You're joking, right?

25:06.504 --> 25:08.573
Please tell me we didn't
come all the way down here

25:08.574 --> 25:10.708
for someone who isn't real.
He is real.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.209
And David is here. I have
the letters to prove it.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.816
Well, I guess we're
gonna need more than that.

25:17.816 --> 25:18.851
What are you doing?

25:18.852 --> 25:21.397
I'm going outside.
I'm coming too.

25:31.396 --> 25:34.498
So, where are we going?

25:34.499 --> 25:36.270
I don't know, I just wanted
to see what was down here.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.371
Oh, I wonder
who these belong to.

25:41.372 --> 25:42.806
Damien.

25:42.807 --> 25:45.541
They're his trophies.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.380
Oh, look, there's a nice spot
for a car right over there.

25:49.380 --> 25:52.619
Uh, do you think she was
telling the truth about David?

25:54.619 --> 25:55.752
I don't know.

25:55.753 --> 25:57.522
She seemed a little off.

25:58.522 --> 26:00.523
I can't believe
he lives out here.

26:00.524 --> 26:01.595
He's like a hermit.

26:03.595 --> 26:04.665
Yeah.

26:06.665 --> 26:10.332
Maybe he's a lone
rider kinda guy.

26:10.333 --> 26:11.833
You know, like your brother.

26:13.704 --> 26:16.642
Um... I'm sorry
about him, earlier.

26:18.642 --> 26:21.546
No, no. Don't be.
He overreacts sometimes.

26:22.546 --> 26:23.712
No. The guy
doesn't like me.

26:23.713 --> 26:24.684
That's not overreacting.

26:26.684 --> 26:29.321
Dad's told him some stuff
that he's heard about you.

26:31.321 --> 26:33.089
Bad reputations never
leave you in small towns,

26:33.090 --> 26:34.523
do they?

26:34.524 --> 26:35.694
Well, what's my reputation?

26:37.694 --> 26:41.597
You are the cute,
innocent girl next door

26:41.598 --> 26:42.801
that got swept away
by the dashing rebel.

26:44.801 --> 26:47.436
Then why am I with you?

26:47.437 --> 26:50.404
Because I'm irresistible.

26:50.405 --> 26:51.205
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

26:51.674 --> 26:53.106
And I'm going to use that
to win over your dad

26:53.107 --> 26:54.543
and he's going to love me too.

26:54.544 --> 26:56.411
And you think that'll work?
Yeah.

26:56.412 --> 26:58.379
I'm gonna make it work.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.817
Because I don't want Kyle
tagging along on our honeymoon.

27:00.818 --> 27:02.483
Not funny.
Funny?

27:02.484 --> 27:03.584
You should have heard
what I was going to say.

27:03.585 --> 27:04.687
Will, come on.
We're leaving!

27:05.687 --> 27:06.827
Duty calls.

27:10.827 --> 27:12.509
You're ready to go?
Mmm-hmm.

27:26.509 --> 27:29.509
- Where you've been?
- So what's the plan?

27:29.511 --> 27:31.379
We're gonna go
to David's house.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.644
I got the woman to tell
me where the address is.

27:32.645 --> 27:33.479
And we're going to trust
some old lady

27:33.480 --> 27:34.816
who lives in the middle
of the woods?

27:34.817 --> 27:36.717
Got no other choice.

27:36.718 --> 27:37.935
Let me get a quick
shot of the diner.

27:58.807 --> 27:59.748
Oh! Sorry.

28:06.748 --> 28:08.982
What exactly are you
takin' pictures of?

28:08.983 --> 28:11.988
My friends and I are doing a
write-up on Madison County.

28:12.988 --> 28:14.987
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:14.989 --> 28:16.989
Well, you see this is
my truck right here,

28:16.990 --> 28:18.761
and I don't appreciate
you takin' pictures of it.

28:21.761 --> 28:24.564
Well, you see, I don't want anything
to do with you or your truck.

28:24.565 --> 28:26.605
So why don't you
move it out of my shot?

28:31.605 --> 28:32.775
Want to say that again?

28:34.775 --> 28:37.489
It'd be in your best interest
to put that knife away.

28:48.489 --> 28:50.691
You kids best be getting out
of here while you still can.

28:51.691 --> 28:54.830
He'll be gettin' wind of you
soon and when he does...

29:11.944 --> 29:13.720
Shit. Thank you. I can't
believe you did that.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.858
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:25.858 --> 29:28.641
Did you see that?
Yeah.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.074
I think we should leave.
We're not leaving.

29:44.075 --> 29:46.010
That guy pulled
a knife on us, James!

29:46.011 --> 29:48.515
You've never seen
a knife before?

29:49.515 --> 29:51.083
People get robbed daily
in big cities,

29:51.084 --> 29:52.717
and they don't move away.

29:52.718 --> 29:53.986
No, that doesn't make it
any better, James.

29:53.987 --> 29:55.753
We're staying.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.722
We leave now, then all that
shit we just went through

29:57.723 --> 30:00.557
was for nothing.

30:00.558 --> 30:02.094
Will got a knife pulled on him.
So what?

30:03.094 --> 30:04.861
You get your interview,
you get your pictures,

30:04.862 --> 30:05.965
and we get the hell
out of here.

30:06.965 --> 30:08.632
If we leave now,

30:08.633 --> 30:11.936
we're making a bigger
deal than it should be.

30:11.937 --> 30:13.003
We'll just try to stay
out of harm's way...

30:13.004 --> 30:14.074
Look out!

30:17.074 --> 30:20.576
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that?

30:20.577 --> 30:22.011
Fuck who it was,
we almost hit him!

30:22.012 --> 30:22.981
Did you not see his face?

30:24.981 --> 30:26.582
Yeah, it's called inbreeding.

30:28.986 --> 30:32.855
♪ And we'd mellow out
in the light of the sun

30:32.856 --> 30:33.691

31:07.056 --> 31:09.158
I don't wanna get shot at
or anything like that.

31:09.159 --> 31:09.928
No, we'll be fine.
Come on.

31:44.927 --> 31:45.960
Hello?

31:53.668 --> 31:54.973
Anybody home?

32:46.753 --> 32:48.028
Hello?

32:54.028 --> 32:55.081
Hey! Open up!

33:14.080 --> 33:14.790
Let's go.

33:23.790 --> 33:25.924
No one's home.
Let's leave.

33:25.925 --> 33:27.791
So we drove all this way
to grab some food

33:27.792 --> 33:29.094
and knock on someone's door?

33:29.095 --> 33:30.994
Sounds like something
I would say.

33:30.995 --> 33:32.299
Because it's stupid.
We're not leaving.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.967
Then what are we
supposed to do?

33:34.967 --> 33:36.300
We need to go back
to the diner,

33:36.301 --> 33:38.105
get more information
from those people.

33:38.106 --> 33:39.939
I'll go.
What?

33:39.940 --> 33:42.074
I'll go back to the diner.

33:42.075 --> 33:44.175
Shouldn't we stay together?

33:44.176 --> 33:45.812
Obviously, he can
take care of himself.

33:46.812 --> 33:47.746
Look, I'll be fine.

33:47.747 --> 33:48.982
Ask to use their phone
when you get there.

33:50.982 --> 33:53.319
Yeah, no problem.

33:54.319 --> 33:56.054
Hey, Kyle!

33:56.055 --> 33:57.924
Here, take the car.

33:58.924 --> 34:00.093
It'll be faster.

34:01.093 --> 34:01.852
Just be careful.

34:26.851 --> 34:29.219
Hi there, young man.
Hi.

34:29.219 --> 34:33.022
Um... You said 1201 Country Lane

34:33.023 --> 34:34.792
is a few miles down the road.

34:34.793 --> 34:37.360
One with the gated drive, right?
Yes, sir.

34:37.362 --> 34:39.029
There's no one there.

34:39.030 --> 34:41.230
Of course not.

34:41.231 --> 34:43.900
He left about the time
his book came out.

34:43.902 --> 34:45.803
Did Damien Ewell kill him?

34:45.804 --> 34:48.170
Oh! I told your friend,

34:48.172 --> 34:52.308
Damien Ewell is
a made-up character.

34:52.309 --> 34:56.013
Where would he get the ideas
for the book if it's not true?

34:56.014 --> 34:59.117
People's imaginations
run wild sometimes.

35:00.117 --> 35:02.151
People around here,
they didn't like it much

35:02.152 --> 35:04.187
that he was telling stories
about them, right?

35:04.188 --> 35:07.290
He made small town
people look bad.

35:07.291 --> 35:10.262
Does David have any family in
the area that we can visit?

35:11.262 --> 35:15.932
No, his family is all
passed, many years ago.

35:15.933 --> 35:18.234
Would you mind telling me where
the nearest cemetery is?

35:18.235 --> 35:20.613
Not at all.

35:29.613 --> 35:31.415
Hey, what about
that barn down there?

35:32.415 --> 35:34.050
Should we go look around?

35:34.051 --> 35:36.321
It might have something
with his name on it.

35:37.321 --> 35:38.886
You know, it could be
where Damien took

35:38.887 --> 35:40.225
the dead body of David Randall.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.191
Doubtful.

35:43.192 --> 35:45.327
Wait. Why, you don't think
this guy's dead?

35:45.328 --> 35:48.463
Not if he's been
sending me letters, no.

35:48.464 --> 35:50.432
Where is he?

35:50.433 --> 35:53.370
And why does everyone around here
act like they don't know this guy?

35:54.369 --> 35:56.437
I don't know.

35:56.438 --> 35:59.040
I'll tell you why? It's because
they're covering something up.

35:59.041 --> 36:00.644
Well, what does the book say?

36:02.644 --> 36:04.485
May I?

36:09.485 --> 36:13.355
Here we go,
story of Damien Ewell.

36:13.356 --> 36:17.926
"Damien was the most dangerous,
undiscovered serial killer in America.

36:17.927 --> 36:21.130
"He killed an estimated
33 people. Maybe more.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.508
"And no one ever
said a word about it."

36:32.508 --> 36:33.945
What the fuck, man?

36:35.944 --> 36:37.379
"He was born in the 1970s.

36:37.380 --> 36:40.213
"His mother was
a great and loving woman,

36:40.214 --> 36:43.953
"until one day, she met a man
that was from out of town.

36:44.953 --> 36:45.984
"He eventually moved in

36:45.985 --> 36:47.122
"and became the closest thing

36:47.123 --> 36:49.125
"Damien ever had to a father.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.392
"But they still
didn't get along."

36:52.393 --> 36:54.497
Hey, are you okay?

36:55.497 --> 36:57.500
I saw you was up here snoopin'.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.402
You ain't with them police,
is you?

37:01.402 --> 37:04.003
Police? No.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.273
What police?

37:06.274 --> 37:07.406
They was looking for
the missing girl.

37:11.178 --> 37:13.116
Have anything to do
with Damien Ewell?

37:15.116 --> 37:17.151
I reckon so.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.953
"Around the age of 11
Damien ran away from home

37:19.954 --> 37:23.258
"and was found days later on the
side of the road, left for dead.

37:25.258 --> 37:27.095
"One of the people
in the town found him.

37:29.095 --> 37:31.196
"He was badly disfigured.

37:31.197 --> 37:34.102
"He'd been tortured to
within an inch of his life.

37:35.102 --> 37:36.271
"They took him home
and from there,

37:37.271 --> 37:40.138
"the townspeople
became very paranoid.

37:40.139 --> 37:42.577
"Someone had hurt
one of their own."

37:44.577 --> 37:47.346
Did they ever find out
who did it?

37:47.347 --> 37:49.449
It was his mother's boyfriend.

37:49.450 --> 37:51.750
That sounds made-up.
It's not.

37:51.751 --> 37:53.453
What happened to him?

37:53.454 --> 37:55.989
He died.

37:55.990 --> 37:58.223
Well, did someone kill
this guy, the boyfriend?

37:58.224 --> 38:01.492
It doesn't say.
Well, that's great.

38:01.493 --> 38:03.326
And here we are,
asking people questions,

38:03.327 --> 38:05.264
I'm sure they don't want
to give the answers to.

38:06.264 --> 38:08.399
You said something
about a girl.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.571
What girl?

38:12.571 --> 38:13.775
Her daddy was sure
Damien did it.

38:16.775 --> 38:18.376
Do you know Erma?

38:18.377 --> 38:20.479
Don't you get it?

38:20.480 --> 38:22.281
They was the ones
that was in on it.

38:23.281 --> 38:24.085
What do you mean?

38:27.085 --> 38:29.089
Hey, I'm not snooping.

38:31.089 --> 38:32.261
Hey, where are you going?

38:55.046 --> 38:56.513
You guys go down
to the end of the driveway.

38:56.514 --> 38:58.251
We'll check the barns
and the house.

39:00.251 --> 39:01.530
Huh! Great.

39:12.530 --> 39:14.160
Come on, let's go poke around.

39:43.159 --> 39:45.394
So, what are we looking for?

39:45.395 --> 39:47.362
Honestly?
I'm not even sure.

39:47.363 --> 39:48.866
Who would've ever thought it
would be this much trouble

39:48.867 --> 39:51.633
to interview a person?
Yeah. No joke.

39:51.634 --> 39:53.569
You know it would
be really easy

39:53.570 --> 39:55.208
to just pack up and go home.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.877
So you're siding with
Brooke and Will now?

39:59.878 --> 40:03.113
No. It just seems like
a lot to go through

40:03.114 --> 40:04.150
just to write a paper,
don't you think?

40:06.149 --> 40:07.415
And wouldn't it be
a huge waste of time

40:07.416 --> 40:09.250
to pack up, drive
all the way out here,

40:09.251 --> 40:11.388
and turn around and go home
after just a couple of hours?

40:12.388 --> 40:13.188
Touche.

40:28.738 --> 40:31.206
So, Jenna,

40:31.207 --> 40:33.575
what brings you all the way
out to Madison County?

40:33.576 --> 40:36.177
Well, once upon a time

40:36.178 --> 40:38.213
there was a really
nice guy named James

40:38.214 --> 40:41.250
who sat behind me in my English class.
Really now?

40:41.251 --> 40:42.450
Yeah, he dragged me
all the way out here

40:42.451 --> 40:43.656
to write a paper on some
book I've never read.

40:46.655 --> 40:47.657
Why didn't you read the book?

40:48.657 --> 40:50.492
Because I've got better
things to do with my time.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.394
Okay.

40:53.395 --> 40:54.697
And what did you think
of this James guy?

40:56.697 --> 40:59.232
He was a bit
of a pig, actually.

40:59.233 --> 41:00.567
Oh, yeah? How so?

41:00.568 --> 41:04.342
Well, occasionally, I would catch
him staring at my ass in class.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.710
And you saw him doing this?

41:08.711 --> 41:11.578
I sure did.

41:11.579 --> 41:14.515
And how come you never brought
this to his attention?

41:14.516 --> 41:16.688
Because I told you earlier,
I didn't mind.

41:36.671 --> 41:37.772
Hey!

41:38.772 --> 41:40.340
It's open.

41:40.341 --> 41:42.541
Should we go in?

41:42.542 --> 41:45.787
Yeah, yeah, I am. You can
stay here if you want.

41:53.787 --> 41:55.294
Hello?

42:01.294 --> 42:02.094
Hello?

42:09.703 --> 42:10.673
Holy shit!

42:13.673 --> 42:14.844
Look at this.

42:17.844 --> 42:20.578
Is that the guy
from the highway?

42:20.579 --> 42:22.315
Looks like him, doesn't it?

42:23.315 --> 42:25.283
It says David.

42:25.284 --> 42:27.819
Do you think that
means David Randall?

42:27.820 --> 42:30.258
I can't imagine
who else it would be.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.431
What's this?

42:38.431 --> 42:40.501
Daddy, Erma, David

42:41.501 --> 42:42.501
and Damien.

42:43.670 --> 42:45.606
Hey, Brooke!

42:46.606 --> 42:47.809
Jenna, is that you?

43:03.756 --> 43:05.761
This place definitely
has a lot of...

43:08.761 --> 43:09.761
- Sorry.
- Stop.

43:15.768 --> 43:17.339
Let's check this out over here.

43:20.339 --> 43:22.319
Shit.

43:34.318 --> 43:35.118
Jesus!

43:37.789 --> 43:40.790
Looks like a mangled
dungeon master lives here.

43:40.791 --> 43:42.726
Looks like someone
still lives here.

43:42.727 --> 43:43.700
Yeah.

43:48.700 --> 43:49.766
Don't do that.

43:49.767 --> 43:51.368
It's okay.

43:51.369 --> 43:52.468
This is turning
into so much work.

43:52.469 --> 43:54.805
I thought this was going
to be a nice trip for us.

43:54.806 --> 43:57.674
It will, it will.

43:57.675 --> 44:02.478
As soon as we're done with James'
stuff, we'll get out of here, okay?

44:02.479 --> 44:05.716
We'll spend a few relaxing
days in the woods.

44:05.717 --> 44:07.683
Just you and me.

44:07.684 --> 44:09.920
Can my brother come?

44:09.921 --> 44:11.664
That's not funny.

44:19.663 --> 44:20.835
Oh, that's weird.

44:25.835 --> 44:28.141
Hey guys, where'd you go?

44:32.141 --> 44:32.647
Hey!

44:38.647 --> 44:41.495
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

44:51.495 --> 44:53.595
I wonder why Kyle's
not back yet.

44:53.596 --> 44:55.731
Do you think he got lost?

44:55.732 --> 44:56.967
Maybe.

44:57.966 --> 44:59.868
I think I'd better go find him.

44:59.869 --> 45:01.703
Well, you're not
leaving me here.

45:02.972 --> 45:04.772
It'll be fine.
I'll just run down there,

45:04.773 --> 45:06.773
it'll be quicker
if I'm by myself.

45:07.642 --> 45:10.478
What, are you trying to
call me fat or something?

45:10.479 --> 45:12.015
There's not an ounce
of fat on your body.

45:13.015 --> 45:14.882
Go catch up to Will and Brooke.

45:14.883 --> 45:17.490
I'll meet you guys
back up here.

45:21.490 --> 45:22.757
Jenna?

45:22.758 --> 45:23.907
Yeah?

45:37.907 --> 45:38.912
Be careful.

45:43.911 --> 45:47.518
Oh, I'm Kyle.
What's your names?

45:51.518 --> 45:53.656
All right.
Fuck me, man.

45:55.656 --> 45:58.636
Mind if I join you
guys down there?

46:08.636 --> 46:10.511
What, me?

46:49.977 --> 46:51.914
Smells really weird in here.

46:54.914 --> 46:55.952
Musty.

46:58.952 --> 47:00.957
That's quite an antler
collection he's got.

47:03.956 --> 47:05.991
Look at this.

47:05.992 --> 47:08.627
What are you going
to do with that?

47:08.628 --> 47:10.761
I don't know.

47:10.762 --> 47:11.833
Bend over, I'll show you.

47:13.833 --> 47:14.866
Will!

47:14.867 --> 47:16.700
Come on?

47:16.701 --> 47:19.104
Yeah, I think I'm going
to hold on to this.

47:19.105 --> 47:21.009
In case we run into any bears
or maybe I get a base hit.

47:24.643 --> 47:25.880
Get out of here.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.048
No mailbox.

48:04.049 --> 48:07.986
I guess the whole not rain, nor sleet,
nor snow thing doesn't apply out here.

48:08.986 --> 48:10.924
Wait, what about
that "posted" sign?

48:12.924 --> 48:15.858
It's got to account
for something.

48:15.859 --> 48:17.729
Maybe we'll run into
a neighbor who will tell us

48:17.730 --> 48:19.896
that we're as crazy
as the old lady did.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.733
Maybe we should just go back.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.168
What if someone's home?

48:24.169 --> 48:25.803
Well, they obviously
don't want to be bothered,

48:25.804 --> 48:27.840
or they wouldn't live out here.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.073
Ah, come on.

48:31.074 --> 48:32.958
Oh, God!

48:47.958 --> 48:50.632
It's a real
fixer-upper.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.115
Got it?

49:12.114 --> 49:14.016
Looks like nobody's home.

49:14.017 --> 49:17.753
Well, let's go meet
with James and Jenna then.

49:17.754 --> 49:18.855
Hey, Brooke?

49:19.855 --> 49:20.692
Yeah?

49:22.692 --> 49:25.793
The stuff you said before,
about grad school,

49:25.794 --> 49:27.762
are you serious about that?

49:27.763 --> 49:29.930
Why?

49:29.931 --> 49:33.135
I don't know. I was just
wondering, that's all.

49:33.136 --> 49:35.239
Will, don't be gay.

49:36.239 --> 49:38.011
Yeah.

49:42.011 --> 49:42.855
Gay! Jesus!

49:52.854 --> 49:54.721
Come on, let's go.

49:54.722 --> 49:56.090
Actually, can you just
give me a quick second?

49:56.091 --> 49:58.725
I'm gonna take a quick
piss somewhere over there.

49:58.726 --> 50:01.027
Okay. Do you want me
to come with you?

50:01.028 --> 50:02.930
Why, you wanna hold it
or something, huh?

50:02.931 --> 50:04.998
No!
No?

50:04.999 --> 50:06.267
Well, then, hang tight,
I'll be right back.

50:06.268 --> 50:08.494
Okay.

50:32.493 --> 50:34.129
Hey!

50:36.129 --> 50:37.346
Hey!

51:26.345 --> 51:27.916
Brooke?

51:29.916 --> 51:32.204
Decided you wanted to hold it?

51:53.372 --> 51:55.077
Will?

51:58.076 --> 51:59.978
Who the fuck are you, huh?

52:00.978 --> 52:02.382
Huh?

52:10.589 --> 52:12.326
Ahhh!

52:14.326 --> 52:16.063
No! Wait!

52:19.063 --> 52:19.833
Please!

52:21.833 --> 52:24.001
Wait! Wait! Wait!

52:24.002 --> 52:25.076
Ahhh!

52:34.179 --> 52:35.183
Will! No!

52:38.182 --> 52:38.982
Ahhh!

52:50.628 --> 52:53.468
Brooke!
Brooke, over here!

52:58.468 --> 53:00.939
Jenna, he got Will!

53:01.939 --> 53:03.038
Who?

53:03.039 --> 53:04.373
Who got Will?

53:04.374 --> 53:07.076
I don't know. I don't know.
It's some man!

53:07.077 --> 53:09.180
He killed him, Jenna,
he killed him!

53:10.180 --> 53:12.382
He killed him?

53:12.383 --> 53:14.951
You saw this?

53:14.952 --> 53:17.186
Jenna, we gotta go.
We gotta get help.

53:17.187 --> 53:18.374
Please!

53:36.373 --> 53:38.274
Oh, my!
Where's Kyle?

53:38.275 --> 53:39.374
Are you okay?

53:39.375 --> 53:41.310
My friend.
From earlier.

53:41.311 --> 53:43.179
Yes, dear. He was here.

53:44.179 --> 53:45.247
And?

53:45.248 --> 53:46.384
And he left.

53:47.384 --> 53:49.385
Where did he go?

53:49.386 --> 53:53.224
He went to find some answers,
that's what he told me.

53:54.224 --> 53:56.258
Now, tell me everything
that happened.

53:56.259 --> 53:57.695
He came out of nowhere.

53:58.695 --> 54:00.229
Who?

54:00.230 --> 54:01.996
I don't know.

54:01.997 --> 54:03.463
Keep walking.

54:03.464 --> 54:06.134
Was it the man
from the highway?

54:06.135 --> 54:07.502
Was it the man with the knife?

54:07.503 --> 54:09.406
I don't know.
Jenna!

54:11.406 --> 54:13.142
There wasn't anybody at that
old house you sent us to.

54:14.142 --> 54:16.510
Oh! Of course not.

54:16.511 --> 54:20.280
I told you David hadn't
lived here in many years.

54:20.281 --> 54:22.282
Bullshit!

54:22.283 --> 54:24.485
There was nothing
I could do, Jenna.

54:24.486 --> 54:28.021
Oh, sweetie, don't even think
about something like that, okay?

54:28.022 --> 54:31.493
We're going to get help and
everything is going to be fine, okay?

54:32.493 --> 54:35.432
Are you calling me a liar?

54:37.432 --> 54:40.233
I'm saying that I don't think
you're telling me the truth.

54:40.234 --> 54:43.437
Jenna, he got Will.

54:43.438 --> 54:45.305
Come on.

54:45.306 --> 54:48.043
I thought David didn't
have any family?

54:50.043 --> 54:51.578
Where did you get that?

54:51.579 --> 54:53.048
Where's his daughter?

54:55.048 --> 54:58.352
I think you better leave now.

54:58.353 --> 55:01.061
Why didn't you tell me
you were Damien's mother?

55:08.061 --> 55:10.464
Oh, his face!
It was awful, Jenna.

55:10.465 --> 55:13.505
No, get up.
We have to keep going.

55:18.505 --> 55:22.375
Boy, you have gone and
gotten yourself in a mess

55:22.376 --> 55:25.214
of something you'll
never get out of.

55:28.214 --> 55:30.516
You're in too deep.

55:30.517 --> 55:33.790
Best start runnin'.
You'll never get out alive.

55:36.790 --> 55:41.165
There's no escape.
There's no escape.

55:45.165 --> 55:46.801
He's gonna be
on your scent soon.

55:48.801 --> 55:52.640
And when he is,
you're gonna be dead.

55:53.640 --> 55:56.310
Run! Run!

55:57.310 --> 55:59.345
Bye-bye.

55:59.346 --> 56:01.122
Bye-bye, nice young man.

56:09.121 --> 56:10.528
Please, Jenna!

56:15.528 --> 56:18.208
James!
Get in the truck.

56:32.110 --> 56:33.343
I told y'all
to go down Pettigrew.

56:33.344 --> 56:35.514
What? What are you talking about?
Are you David Randall?

56:35.515 --> 56:37.214
Yeah, I'm David Randall.

56:37.215 --> 56:38.550
Why didn't you tell me
that when we first met?

56:38.551 --> 56:40.417
It's complicated.

56:40.418 --> 56:43.321
There's so many things that
don't make sense around here.

56:43.322 --> 56:46.156
They'll all make sense
soon enough.

57:10.448 --> 57:11.359
Jenna!

58:48.243 --> 58:49.246
Hey!

58:50.246 --> 58:51.246
Over here!

59:27.649 --> 59:28.827
Come on out.

59:38.826 --> 59:40.359
Where's my daughter?

59:40.360 --> 59:42.562
Is that the last of 'em?

59:42.563 --> 59:44.608
Sorry, James.

01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:04.810
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:31.088
Ahhh!

01:00:42.088 --> 01:00:42.789
Ahhh!

01:00:47.093 --> 01:00:48.662
Help!

01:00:50.662 --> 01:00:51.829
Help me!

01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:55.370
Please!

01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:59.675
Help me, please!

01:01:03.675 --> 01:01:05.411
Help!
Help!

01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:07.916
Help!
Help me!

01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:13.487
Help me, please!

01:02:30.527 --> 01:02:31.661
Jenna.

01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:13.741
You kids don't worry none.
He'll be in here soon.

01:03:20.741 --> 01:03:22.943
We're never gonna
get out alive.

01:03:22.944 --> 01:03:25.882
Don't say that, I'm gonna
get us out of here.

01:03:27.882 --> 01:03:29.749
Where am I?

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.750
Who is that?

01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:31.586
Shh!

01:03:31.587 --> 01:03:33.253
Just stay quiet.

01:03:33.254 --> 01:03:34.960
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.928
I'm sorry.

01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:43.564
I had no choice.

01:03:43.565 --> 01:03:44.901
What's going on?
Who are you?

01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:47.070
Is this your daughter?

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:49.838
Yes.

01:03:51.838 --> 01:03:53.973
And this is your plan
to save her?

01:03:53.974 --> 01:03:55.741
I had to do something!

01:03:55.742 --> 01:03:57.109
You used me as bait!

01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:59.590
What are you talking about?

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:11.762
David,

01:04:14.762 --> 01:04:17.001
where are my friends?

01:04:20.001 --> 01:04:21.872
If they're not here,
they're dead.

01:04:33.612 --> 01:04:35.754
We're never
going to get out of here.

01:05:16.821 --> 01:05:19.794
Damien, we've done
nothing to hurt you.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:24.631
Damien.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.933
Let us go. You'll
never see us again.

01:06:07.105 --> 01:06:07.855
No!

01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:37.776
Ahhh!

01:06:45.776 --> 01:06:46.874
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:56.771
Look out! Ahhh!

01:07:14.771 --> 01:07:17.045
No!

01:07:23.045 --> 01:07:24.784
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:07:28.784 --> 01:07:30.857
Let's get him out of here.

01:08:18.966 --> 01:08:21.108
Hurry! Hurry!

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:29.951
Hurry!

01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:37.822
Hurry! Hurry!

01:08:41.821 --> 01:08:42.859
Dad! No!

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:47.875
No!

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:31.078
Come on.

01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:06.197
Howdy there!

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.303
Oh, my!

01:11:12.303 --> 01:11:16.074
My Lord, child.
What happened to you?

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:19.709
The man...

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:23.047
The man with the face.
He killed my friends.

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:26.419
Who killed your friends, missy?

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:29.286
The pig.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.124
Pig head.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:38.192
Where are my other friends?

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:42.097
Oh, I haven't seen
your friends, dearie.

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:45.566
We've been slow
since I saw you last.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:49.125
Oh, my, I'll get you
a glass of water.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.163
Here.

01:12:15.163 --> 01:12:17.467
Who did you say
killed your friends?

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.170
Big pig head.

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:25.241
We don't have a moment to lose.

01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:29.577
You go stand by my car.

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:34.248
I'll get my keys and I'll take
you to the doctor's house,

01:12:34.249 --> 01:12:36.738
and then we'll call
the Sheriff from there.
