02:07.477 --> 02:09.646
Another afternoon
with Roderick?

02:09.681 --> 02:11.481
Yep.

02:11.515 --> 02:15.787
Did you tell him?

02:15.820 --> 02:16.821
No.

02:17.855 --> 02:19.957
You have to tell him.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.896
I think I'm falling for him.

02:25.295 --> 02:26.931
Bullshit.
This is a college crush.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.835
Well, what if it isn't?

02:31.569 --> 02:33.403
You have to tell him.
This isn't something

02:33.437 --> 02:35.372
can wait until the
last minute with.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.406
I know.

02:37.975 --> 02:39.977
He has a right to know Morgan.

02:40.845 --> 02:42.412
I think I actually have

02:42.446 --> 02:45.817
like serious,
serious feelings for him.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.652
Then he absolutely
has a right to know.

02:47.685 --> 02:49.987
Plans have to be made.
This is going to affect him too.

02:50.021 --> 02:51.221
You're right.

02:51.989 --> 02:54.524
Going to Paris next
semester is the right choice.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.528
Yeah, golly-jeepers,

02:58.563 --> 03:00.430
I've never been to Europe,
I can hardly wait.

03:00.464 --> 03:01.465
Just tell him, okay?

03:01.966 --> 03:03.533
Paris isn't going anywhere.

03:05.903 --> 03:07.537
I'm just saying, what if...

03:08.505 --> 03:09.774
Don't you fucking say it!

03:10.141 --> 03:13.243
Ahh, you are not gonna postpone
Paris for this nerd.

03:13.711 --> 03:16.346
Like I said, Paris isn't going
anywhere.

03:16.379 --> 03:18.716
You are not going to give up
your scholarship for this

03:18.750 --> 03:19.717
goofball mama's boy.

03:19.751 --> 03:20.752
Don't call him that.

03:20.785 --> 03:22.754
He's a rich mama's boy who
studies literature.

03:23.054 --> 03:24.889
He-he's studying to be a
professor.

03:24.922 --> 03:27.324
Of literature. It's boring.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.862
Okay, this is a college crush!

03:30.895 --> 03:32.830
You guys are going to graduate
and go your separate ways.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.599
It's inevitable.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.767
What if I really love him?

03:37.034 --> 03:39.302
Get over it!

03:39.604 --> 03:41.606
Get over it and go to Paris?

03:41.839 --> 03:42.907
Who knows, you might want

03:42.940 --> 03:45.910
to have a French
boyfriend for a while.

03:45.943 --> 03:47.945
Yeah, and then what?

03:49.446 --> 03:51.883
Live your fucking life.
I don't know.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.818
It's fun, college is supposed

03:53.851 --> 03:56.453
to be fun and games.
You know?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.756
Yeah, and studying, and degrees.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.057
Okay, you know what I mean.

04:00.091 --> 04:01.259
Besides, what are
you gonna do

04:01.291 --> 04:04.929
follow him around while he
tries to find a teaching job?

04:04.962 --> 04:05.963
I might.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.765
And what are you going to do?

04:08.699 --> 04:09.700
Fuck, I don't know.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.737
Holy shit Morgan!

04:13.070 --> 04:14.772
How many times have you
told me about your dad baking

04:14.806 --> 04:15.873
pastries his
whole life-

04:15.907 --> 04:17.875
- Liz -
- so that you could go to school?

04:17.909 --> 04:19.944
Liz, do not guilt trip
me like that.

04:19.976 --> 04:24.982
You were handed a scholarship to
go to Paris for Christ's sake.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.852
Ahhhhh!

04:27.885 --> 04:30.520
Fuck. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

04:31.055 --> 04:32.657
Well, first of all...

04:34.792 --> 04:37.061
...you're going
to take a shower.

04:37.094 --> 04:42.099
Cuz I say this with peace and
love, you have serious B.O.

04:43.734 --> 04:44.936
- Oh!
- Yeah.

04:44.969 --> 04:45.970
Oh...

04:46.270 --> 04:47.705
...damn, I am sorry.

04:47.738 --> 04:48.706
It's okay.

04:48.739 --> 04:49.740
Second...

04:50.308 --> 04:52.610
...you're going to
study and get through finals.

04:52.643 --> 04:54.645
Like you said, Paris
isn't going anywhere

04:54.679 --> 04:55.913
and neither is
Roderick.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.149
You're gonna enjoy the rest of
your semester.

04:58.182 --> 05:02.519
Spend the break with your boy
and then jet off to Europe.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.888
You know I'm right.

05:04.288 --> 05:06.123
C'est la vie! Eh eh eh.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.960
I know, you're right.

05:09.994 --> 05:12.964
One thing at a time.
But you have to tell him.

05:14.932 --> 05:16.433
I'll tell him.

05:16.466 --> 05:19.170
Yeah! Yeah, I'll-I'm uh, I'm
gonna tell him.

05:19.203 --> 05:22.573
I'll just tell him.

05:22.607 --> 05:23.941
You know what though?

05:23.975 --> 05:25.142
What?

05:25.508 --> 05:27.845
You're the best roomie ever.

05:27.879 --> 05:29.479
Eh, that's true. Okay...

05:31.148 --> 05:33.618
Okay, yeah you know, you reek.

05:33.985 --> 05:34.819
Oh yeah, sorry.

05:34.852 --> 05:36.921
- Kay...
- I'm going to take a shower now.

05:36.954 --> 05:37.989
Yeah, good.

05:38.022 --> 05:39.824
Hey, while you're at it...

05:40.992 --> 05:42.960
...ménage... ménage à moi.

05:42.994 --> 05:46.664
No. No, no you did
not just say that.

05:46.697 --> 05:47.865
I did.

05:47.899 --> 05:50.701
- I did.
- Okay, well I'm gonna go now.

05:50.735 --> 05:52.169
Concentrate on yourself.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.106
Self love!

05:55.139 --> 05:57.942
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-Kay.
- A lot of it.

05:57.975 --> 05:59.977
Self love. Self love.

06:00.811 --> 06:01.879
I des...

06:02.914 --> 06:06.017
I deserve self love.

06:33.510 --> 06:35.478
Hey Babe, you're late.

06:39.784 --> 06:40.785
What's wrong?

06:42.219 --> 06:43.688
I, um...

06:47.892 --> 06:48.926
I have some bad news.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.594
What is it?

06:50.628 --> 06:51.696
Is everything okay?

06:52.730 --> 06:54.732
My father... is sick.

06:55.666 --> 06:56.667
That's terrible.

06:57.001 --> 07:00.503
He hasn't been well for,
for quite a while now.

07:00.537 --> 07:01.973
I had no idea.

07:02.539 --> 07:06.010
I mean, you never really
talk about your father.

07:07.144 --> 07:10.614
I suppose combinations
of simple bits

07:10.648 --> 07:14.852
of information can create
emotional responses.

07:14.885 --> 07:17.955
I really do not care
much for father.

07:17.989 --> 07:20.024
He's always been
sickly and more of

07:20.057 --> 07:24.527
a patient in a hospital ward we
call his room.

07:24.562 --> 07:25.963
He can only eat certain foods.

07:25.997 --> 07:29.166
I was always too
loud as a child.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.868
He's prone to shy
away from the light.

07:30.901 --> 07:34.805
He would always flinch when
I tried to touch him.

07:34.839 --> 07:38.576
I... don't want to bother you
with the particulars.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.746
Nevertheless, he has an acute
bodily illness, of which I'm

07:41.779 --> 07:44.782
sure is more
mental than physical.

07:44.815 --> 07:49.820
So, is he really sick or is
he a hypochondriac?

07:50.855 --> 07:55.059
This time, he is near death,
so my mother tells me.

07:57.361 --> 08:00.998
I'm so sorry.
What are you going to do?

08:03.634 --> 08:05.803
Mother needs me.

08:06.103 --> 08:08.272
I have to leave and go back
home for a little while.

08:09.807 --> 08:10.808
- When?
- Now.

08:13.177 --> 08:14.779
This evening, actually.

08:16.614 --> 08:18.682
But what about school?
What about finals?

08:18.949 --> 08:21.218
I've spent the day
speaking with professors.

08:21.252 --> 08:23.888
Some will let me use homework
assignments and quizzes for

08:23.921 --> 08:24.989
class grades.

08:25.022 --> 08:27.024
But that's gonna
affect your GPA.

08:27.858 --> 08:28.859
Ah well, what can I do?

08:30.027 --> 08:32.996
But you've been working so hard.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.865
It's not the end of the world.

08:34.899 --> 08:37.034
I'll re-take some
courses if I must.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.270
Are you sure you have to go?

08:40.136 --> 08:41.871
Mother insists.

08:42.740 --> 08:45.943
She's really not allowing for
any hesitation.

08:48.813 --> 08:50.181
How long will you be gone?

08:50.214 --> 08:52.817
Probably through the semester
break I should imagine.

08:53.417 --> 08:56.020
It's hard to say really.

08:57.388 --> 08:59.123
Roderick... I... um...

08:59.156 --> 09:00.324
I have something-

09:00.357 --> 09:03.894
It's alright sweetheart, um...

09:03.928 --> 09:05.963
...you don't have
to say anything.

09:07.331 --> 09:08.899
I'll be alright.

09:15.239 --> 09:18.042
I'll call you when I get
there tonight, okay?

09:32.423 --> 09:33.958
Fuck...

09:35.693 --> 09:37.962
I couldn't
fucking tell him, Liz!

09:37.995 --> 09:39.063
His...

09:39.598 --> 09:42.166
His father is literally dying!

09:42.199 --> 09:44.835
What was I supposed to say?
Hey, I'm breaking up with you?

09:44.869 --> 09:46.137
Don't look at as breaking up.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.304
And now he's going home!

09:47.338 --> 09:50.407
He's going home, all alone,
and he's going there to...

09:51.909 --> 09:53.344
...watch his father die!

09:53.544 --> 09:55.012
That's a little dramatic.

09:55.045 --> 09:56.180
By the time...

09:56.213 --> 09:58.782
...his dad is dead and buried
he's going

09:58.816 --> 09:59.950
to be coming back next
semester...

09:59.984 --> 10:02.753
and I'm going to be in, in
fucking Paris!

10:03.053 --> 10:04.889
Or in Paris fucking.

10:04.922 --> 10:05.990
What?

10:06.023 --> 10:06.991
You'll be okay.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.025
That's not what you said!

10:08.058 --> 10:11.162
You'll be in Paris!
I said you'll be in Paris.

10:11.630 --> 10:15.032
Listen he said he'd call
you, just tell him then.

10:15.634 --> 10:17.201
Over the phone?
I can't tell him over the phone.

10:17.234 --> 10:18.969
Like, how messed up is that?

10:19.537 --> 10:21.138
Sorry your dad's dying,

10:21.172 --> 10:23.274
but I'm gonna be
going to fucking France!

10:23.307 --> 10:24.475
You should have told him sooner.

10:24.508 --> 10:26.210
No shit Liz!

10:27.144 --> 10:28.712
I'm sorry.

10:28.746 --> 10:30.147
Sorry.

10:31.916 --> 10:32.950
No...

10:32.983 --> 10:35.219
...it's my fault. I should
have told him sooner.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.821
I was just scared he was gonna

10:37.855 --> 10:40.291
like breakup with
me or something.

10:40.324 --> 10:41.825
You don't know that.

10:44.795 --> 10:47.064
He's not going to be able to
handle this Liz.

10:47.498 --> 10:49.300
You don't know that either.

10:49.668 --> 10:51.869
He seems like a strong person.

10:52.536 --> 10:54.004
You just think he's some

10:54.038 --> 10:57.374
goofball, geeky,
nerdy guy. You don't know him.

10:57.408 --> 10:59.877
Geeky nerdy guys
can handle a lot...

11:00.511 --> 11:05.049
...can't they?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.951
He's reserved, ya know?

11:07.586 --> 11:10.921
He comes from
like some ancient family,

11:10.955 --> 11:13.357
who has like a certain
temperament, and...

11:13.390 --> 11:16.760
like they're the kind of family
that donates to charity.

11:17.061 --> 11:19.096
They're
into the arts.

11:19.129 --> 11:24.101
He's not really a strong man...
you know? He's...

11:25.469 --> 11:27.037
...he's sensitive.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.040
I have an idea.

11:30.841 --> 11:31.842
What?

11:32.509 --> 11:34.211
I know you're upset...

11:34.613 --> 11:35.813
...but just hear me out.

11:35.846 --> 11:37.514
I'm your friend, right?

11:38.282 --> 11:39.450
Right?

11:40.951 --> 11:43.954
I think you need a break
tonight, okay?

11:43.988 --> 11:46.257
And starting fresh in the
morning, hit the books.

11:46.523 --> 11:49.493
Concentrate on
your studies, the finals.

11:50.261 --> 11:54.965
I say this with peace and love,
you need to get through this.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.835
This is a hiccup.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.536
Everything's going
to be fine, right?

12:02.172 --> 12:05.876
Then, after finals, go see him.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.279
Go see him?

12:08.312 --> 12:10.147
Yeah. Go out there.
Be there for him.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.416
Meet his family.
Meet his mother.

12:12.449 --> 12:14.918
Lord knows you need to get along
with his mom if you're actually

12:14.952 --> 12:18.422
falling for this goofball.

12:18.455 --> 12:21.292
No, but it'll be good for the
both of you.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.428
You can tell him about Paris and
you guys can make a plan for

12:24.461 --> 12:27.464
when you get back from Europe.

12:30.467 --> 12:33.070
It's okay, everything is fine.

12:41.078 --> 12:44.415
Yeah, I think I did pretty well.

12:45.549 --> 12:49.453
I mean, I'm you know,
just trying to stay positive.

12:49.754 --> 12:52.956
I mean, I studied as hard as I
could and now we just wait for

12:52.990 --> 12:56.594
the grades to be posted.

12:56.628 --> 12:58.395
How's your dad?

12:58.797 --> 13:00.497
When I called you
a couple of days ago,

13:00.531 --> 13:03.400
I said he was up but very weak.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.437
I think he's gotten worse.

13:06.470 --> 13:09.406
The doctor is here and plans
to stay until the end.

13:12.276 --> 13:14.978
This might sound
a little morbid, but...

13:15.814 --> 13:18.849
Does the doctor know
when the end might be?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.151
No, not really.

13:21.185 --> 13:25.255
I suppose it could be days,
weeks, or hours.

13:25.289 --> 13:27.659
Who knows when
the bell will toll?

13:27.692 --> 13:29.426
I miss you.

13:29.627 --> 13:31.195
Yeah?

13:31.995 --> 13:33.931
I miss you too babe.

13:35.532 --> 13:38.135
So...
How 'bout I come up there?

13:39.169 --> 13:40.137
Up here?

13:40.170 --> 13:41.673
Yeah.

13:41.706 --> 13:42.906
Why?

13:43.474 --> 13:45.876
Cause I wanna be there for you?

13:46.443 --> 13:47.511
I don't need you here.

13:47.712 --> 13:48.646
Really.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.348
Mmm, I think you do,
you just don't know it.

13:51.382 --> 13:53.384
I don't think it's a good idea.

13:53.852 --> 13:55.953
I can meet your family.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.590
You don't want to introduce me
to your family?

13:58.623 --> 14:01.158
No, no, I-I-I do.

14:01.191 --> 14:02.192
I just...

14:02.861 --> 14:05.095
I just don't think
now is the best time.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.331
It's the perfect time actually.

14:07.665 --> 14:10.200
I can be there for you,
support you, you know?

14:10.234 --> 14:15.239
That's... really kind of you...
Morgan.

14:18.075 --> 14:19.376
And there's something
else we need to talk about.

14:19.410 --> 14:20.511
What?

14:20.544 --> 14:22.513
I'd rather not say
over the phone.

14:22.546 --> 14:23.347
Is everything alright?

14:23.648 --> 14:27.217
Of course. I'd just rather
talk about it in person.

14:28.085 --> 14:29.286
About what?

14:29.587 --> 14:31.455
Next semester...

14:31.488 --> 14:34.091
...just wanna plan some things.

14:36.093 --> 14:38.095
Can it wait?

14:40.431 --> 14:43.100
Look, my last final's tomorrow,
classes end next week.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.502
There's nothing here for me.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.137
May as well make my way up

14:47.171 --> 14:49.072
there so I can spend
more time with you.

14:49.106 --> 14:52.142
I just... I don't
think it's a good idea.

14:52.509 --> 14:55.446
Well, will you at
least think about it?

14:58.783 --> 15:01.018
I'll think about it.

15:02.554 --> 15:05.422
So he said he misses you but he
doesn't think that it's a good

15:05.456 --> 15:07.725
idea for you to come out?

15:07.759 --> 15:08.959
Yep.

15:11.763 --> 15:15.065
But he didn't say no,
don't come out?

15:15.098 --> 15:15.999
Nope.

15:16.033 --> 15:18.502
Okay, just that he
doesn't think that it's

15:18.535 --> 15:21.538
a good idea, but that
he'd think about it?

15:21.573 --> 15:22.574
Yep.

15:23.140 --> 15:25.075
Yeah, you should definitely go.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.543
- Right?
- Yeah.

15:26.578 --> 15:28.078
You should go today!

15:28.111 --> 15:30.615
We think so much alike!
I already bought a ticket.

15:31.048 --> 15:32.416
Can you take me
to the train station?

15:32.449 --> 15:34.017
- Absolutely!
- Let's go.

15:34.051 --> 15:35.419
- How's this one?
- Mmm, yeah.

15:35.452 --> 15:37.020
- Yeah?
- It's good.

15:37.054 --> 15:38.455
Okay.

15:42.627 --> 15:44.294
Thanks so much for everything.

15:44.328 --> 15:45.563
Of course.

15:45.597 --> 15:47.765
I'm probably not going to see
you before you leave for France.

15:47.799 --> 15:49.634
So...

15:49.667 --> 15:51.034
I wanted to give you this.

15:51.401 --> 15:52.570
Oh, what is this?

15:52.604 --> 15:54.238
It's a wallet silly.

15:54.271 --> 15:57.541
It's just for some euros for
taxis, airports, whatever.

15:57.575 --> 15:59.543
You don't wanna carry
too much cash around.

15:59.811 --> 16:01.211
Awe...

16:01.245 --> 16:02.479
Thank you so much.

16:02.513 --> 16:04.414
Yeah, of course. You're welcome.

16:04.448 --> 16:06.083
Well, keep in touch okay.

16:06.116 --> 16:08.318
And let me know if there are any
cute guys cause I'll fly

16:08.352 --> 16:09.587
over and join you.

16:09.621 --> 16:12.122
Oh yeah, definitely.
You can have a mad tryst!

16:13.423 --> 16:15.593
Yes, You know it.

16:15.627 --> 16:17.361
Okay. Well...

16:17.394 --> 16:18.529
I gotta go.

16:18.997 --> 16:20.097
Awe, I'm gonna cry.

16:20.130 --> 16:22.266
No, seriously don't. It's not
like you're never going

16:22.299 --> 16:24.201
to see me again.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.502
I better see you again!

16:25.536 --> 16:27.070
We're hanging out big
time when you get back.

16:27.104 --> 16:28.205
I want juicy stories.

16:28.238 --> 16:31.475
Take care of yourself.
Say hi to the mama's boy for me.

16:32.577 --> 16:33.711
Oh, I will.

16:33.745 --> 16:35.178
Be safe!

16:35.212 --> 16:38.415
Track 23. Now boarding.

16:39.216 --> 16:44.154
Track 23.

17:08.244 --> 17:09.714
Gum?

17:09.747 --> 17:11.749
No thanks.

17:13.785 --> 17:15.752
Sucker?

17:15.787 --> 17:20.791
I'm good.

17:21.391 --> 17:23.828
I didn't think I could get a
lift out here, do you get a lot

17:23.861 --> 17:25.262
of business?

17:25.295 --> 17:26.430
Yeah sure.

17:26.698 --> 17:29.634
Make plenty drivin'
folks around the city.

17:30.034 --> 17:31.569
So there's a lot to
do out here then?

17:33.403 --> 17:34.739
Not really.

17:37.642 --> 17:40.177
Are you from here?

17:40.210 --> 17:41.211
Born and bred.

17:42.346 --> 17:44.281
Do you know the Ushers?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.416
Know of them.

17:47.685 --> 17:49.754
You here on account of
Mister Usher fallin' ill?

17:49.787 --> 17:50.755
Yes.

17:50.788 --> 17:51.789
I'm dating his son.

17:52.857 --> 17:53.858
His son?

17:54.659 --> 17:55.660
Roderick?

17:56.961 --> 17:58.161
Huh.

17:58.696 --> 18:00.832
Thought the
boy went off to college.

18:01.465 --> 18:03.568
Yeah. That's where we met.

18:05.570 --> 18:07.605
Good thing he
got out of that house.

18:08.606 --> 18:09.607
Why?

18:10.074 --> 18:13.443
Ushers have owned
most of the land around here.

18:13.978 --> 18:15.178
Really?

18:15.747 --> 18:17.582
Have for several generations.

18:27.625 --> 18:30.360
- Here we are.
- Um.

18:30.394 --> 18:32.462
Can't you just drive me all the
way up to the house?

18:33.397 --> 18:34.799
This is as far as I go.

18:34.832 --> 18:35.833
Okay.

18:55.019 --> 18:56.821
You never answered my question.

18:56.854 --> 18:59.824
Why is it good that
Roderick left the house?

19:01.324 --> 19:04.562
Kids should grow up,
get out on their own.

19:04.762 --> 19:07.264
Don't you agree?

19:07.632 --> 19:09.801
I suppose so.

20:51.501 --> 20:52.502
May I help you?

20:52.703 --> 20:54.471
Hi! I'm Morgan Segal.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.339
I'm Roderick's girlfriend.

20:56.373 --> 20:57.608
Is he at home?

20:57.809 --> 20:58.810
Roderick's girlfriend?

21:00.011 --> 21:01.012
You must mean from college.

21:01.311 --> 21:02.512
Yeah, that's right.

21:03.446 --> 21:04.682
Of course... Uh...

21:05.283 --> 21:07.350
I wasn't told to expect anyone.

21:07.384 --> 21:08.719
It's kind of a surprise.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.621
Roderick wasn't expecting me.

21:11.421 --> 21:12.690
I see.

21:12.723 --> 21:15.092
Well, you've come
at an awkward time.

21:15.126 --> 21:17.360
I know. I know,
Roderick's father is sick.

21:17.394 --> 21:18.262
Yes.

21:18.296 --> 21:20.463
Which is exactly
why I wanted to come.

21:20.497 --> 21:22.465
I wanted to come to
support him, you know?

21:22.499 --> 21:24.769
During this
really difficult time.

21:27.104 --> 21:28.606
Yes, of course.

21:29.406 --> 21:30.507
Come in.

21:40.785 --> 21:42.485
Are you an Usher?

21:42.920 --> 21:47.925
No. I'm the butler, Vincent.
Vincent Ellerbe.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.964
Very nice to meet you
Mister Ellerbe.

21:53.764 --> 21:58.468
Um, it's really dark in here,
I'm kind of afraid to move

21:58.501 --> 22:01.672
around. I don't want
to bump into anything.

22:01.706 --> 22:04.976
Mister Usher is
very sensitive to the light.

22:05.009 --> 22:07.745
We must keep the drapes closed.

22:07.778 --> 22:09.146
Yes...

22:09.180 --> 22:13.718
...we must allow our eyes to
get used to the dark.

22:13.751 --> 22:15.786
But I assure you, there is...

22:15.820 --> 22:18.656
nothing to be afraid of.

22:19.223 --> 22:21.192
If you'll wait here, I'll let
Master Roderick

22:21.225 --> 22:25.528
know you've arrived.

22:25.563 --> 22:27.565
Master Roderick.

23:01.632 --> 23:02.667
Master Roderick...

23:02.867 --> 23:04.001
Miss Segal.

23:05.202 --> 23:07.872
Master Roderick.

23:07.905 --> 23:09.941
Thank you Vincent. You may
dispense with the protocol.

23:09.974 --> 23:11.842
She's a personal friend.

23:11.876 --> 23:12.877
Very good sir.

23:16.013 --> 23:17.048
Babe...

23:17.081 --> 23:18.082
Have a seat.

23:19.951 --> 23:21.786
What are you doing here?

23:21.819 --> 23:24.121
Well, it's good to see you too,
Master Roderick.

23:24.388 --> 23:25.723
Don't call me that.

23:25.756 --> 23:27.124
Don't worry.

23:27.858 --> 23:31.662
Master anything hasn't been used
in my family for generations.

23:31.696 --> 23:33.164
It's not like that.

23:33.197 --> 23:35.900
It's a prefix for a young
gentleman of the better class

23:35.933 --> 23:37.902
who is not yet enough
to be called mister.

23:37.935 --> 23:41.471
And there you go mansplainin'
again. I'm just teasing you.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.275
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm... kind of on edge.

23:44.308 --> 23:45.576
I know.

23:45.876 --> 23:46.978
That's exactly why I'm here.

23:48.179 --> 23:50.748
To help calm you
down, center you.

23:50.781 --> 23:53.718
It's very thoughtful of you to
come all this way but I told you

23:53.751 --> 23:55.653
it wasn't a good idea.

23:55.686 --> 23:58.656
Do you think I
want you here with my...

23:58.689 --> 24:00.157
...my father being sick?

24:01.592 --> 24:02.626
Listen babe...

24:02.994 --> 24:04.562
...whether you realize it or
not,

24:05.129 --> 24:06.731
you need me here.

24:07.398 --> 24:09.166
If we're going to be in a
serious relationship,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.802
it's exactly times like this
that we need to be there for one

24:11.836 --> 24:12.937
another.

24:12.970 --> 24:14.005
Together.

24:16.574 --> 24:18.508
It's very thoughtful of you.

24:21.012 --> 24:23.247
But I have to warn you,
your stay might be a bit...

24:23.280 --> 24:24.315
...unnerving.

24:24.348 --> 24:25.548
How so?

24:44.969 --> 24:47.872
I didn't know
we were expecting visitors.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.740
Mother, I would like to
introduce you to a friend

24:49.774 --> 24:51.108
from school, Morgan Segal.

24:51.142 --> 24:52.343
Morgan...

24:52.376 --> 24:54.678
...my mother, Lady Usher.

24:55.913 --> 24:58.249
It's a pleasure to meet you.

25:04.855 --> 25:07.158
Never be the first to offer your
hand to be shaken when being

25:07.191 --> 25:09.093
introduced to
the lady of the house.

25:09.126 --> 25:11.662
Instead, you must
wait for the hostess to

25:11.695 --> 25:14.365
offer her hand to you.

25:14.398 --> 25:16.901
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

25:17.501 --> 25:19.970
I'm just fooling with you.

25:20.004 --> 25:22.339
Ahh, one thing's for sure,
you'll have to get used to the

25:22.373 --> 25:23.808
Usher sense of humor.

25:23.841 --> 25:24.842
For sure.

25:25.709 --> 25:26.811
Well...

25:26.844 --> 25:29.613
...it's always nice to meet a
friend of Roderick's.

25:33.084 --> 25:34.852
Girl-friend, actually.

25:36.087 --> 25:38.222
Girl-friend? Really?

25:38.422 --> 25:39.890
I didn't know.

25:39.924 --> 25:41.092
Well...

25:41.125 --> 25:43.794
Maybe you just slipped his mind.

25:43.828 --> 25:44.995
I was going to tell you.

25:45.029 --> 25:46.764
Of course you were.

25:46.797 --> 25:49.033
I know you wouldn't keep
something as important as a

25:49.066 --> 25:51.035
girl-friend from your mother.

25:51.068 --> 25:54.238
With everything going on
I'm sure it...

25:54.271 --> 25:55.306
Yes?

25:55.940 --> 25:57.041
It...

25:58.008 --> 26:00.878
...as you said, it must've
just slipped his mind.

26:00.911 --> 26:03.013
Don't make excuses for him.

26:03.447 --> 26:05.182
No, of course not. I-

26:05.216 --> 26:06.817
Of course not.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.721
Now then...

26:11.322 --> 26:12.656
...did you take the train?

26:13.124 --> 26:14.158
I did.

26:15.759 --> 26:18.963
Well, you must be
tired from your trip.

26:18.996 --> 26:20.131
I am a little.

26:20.364 --> 26:22.133
Dinner will be
served in an hour and a half.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.702
Vincent will show you to your
room where you can freshen up.

26:24.735 --> 26:27.838
Bath and shower are down the
hall, do dress for dinner

26:27.872 --> 26:31.008
and we'll see you back down here
in an hour for cocktails.

26:31.041 --> 26:33.444
You're not a teetotaler,
are you?

26:33.477 --> 26:34.678
No ma'am.

26:34.712 --> 26:37.848
Good. If there's one thing I
detest; it is the practice and

26:37.882 --> 26:41.218
promotion of complete personal
abstinence from alcohol.

26:41.252 --> 26:42.653
No ma'am. I drink.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.655
Well, you're not a lush are you?

26:45.222 --> 26:46.123
No. No ma'am.

26:46.157 --> 26:48.792
She's a very
responsible drinker mother.

26:51.428 --> 26:54.098
Vincent, please show our
guest to her room.

26:54.298 --> 26:55.900
Yes madam.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.836
There are cocktail dresses in
the closet, do help yourself.

26:58.869 --> 27:02.873
I'm sure you have wonderful
taste and won't disappoint.

27:02.907 --> 27:03.974
I can show her to her room.

27:04.008 --> 27:06.977
Vincent knows
his place in this house.

27:07.211 --> 27:08.379
Please respect his title.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.381
Of course.

27:10.649 --> 27:12.183
This way please.

27:16.854 --> 27:17.955
When were you going to tell me

27:17.988 --> 27:19.423
about this
little girl-friend of yours?

27:19.456 --> 27:21.258
I, I, I... How long have
you been seeing her?

27:21.292 --> 27:22.726
A few months.

27:22.760 --> 27:23.928
Months?!

27:23.961 --> 27:25.462
Months?!
And you haven't said a word?!

27:38.509 --> 27:40.477
As madam said, cocktails in one

27:40.511 --> 27:42.813
hour, dinner
thirty minutes after.

27:42.846 --> 27:44.949
Dresses in the closet.

27:45.349 --> 27:47.384
I believe they are
in the right size.

27:47.418 --> 27:49.286
Um, Vincent...

27:49.320 --> 27:51.288
Roderick didn't
know I was coming.

27:51.322 --> 27:54.158
How is it you already have
dresses for me?

27:54.626 --> 27:57.795
You're not the first guest in
the House of Usher.

27:58.329 --> 28:00.130
I see.

28:00.531 --> 28:03.467
Roderick's had other
girl-friends here.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.835
No miss.

28:05.269 --> 28:08.739
You are Master
Roderick's first guest...

28:09.073 --> 28:10.374
...ever.

28:54.351 --> 28:55.553
Oh my God, you scared me.

28:55.587 --> 28:57.354
I'm sorry.

28:57.388 --> 28:58.822
I'm not.

28:58.856 --> 29:00.024
You look amazing.

29:00.057 --> 29:01.058
Thank you.

29:01.325 --> 29:02.326
Who is the artist?

29:02.594 --> 29:05.429
That would be my
very talented son.

29:07.331 --> 29:08.299
I'm impressed.

29:08.332 --> 29:09.933
- You should be.
- Thank you.

29:11.636 --> 29:14.305
There is a darkness to them.

29:14.805 --> 29:17.541
Don't get me wrong,
I do love the art. But...

29:17.575 --> 29:20.044
...they just seem
a little dark to me.

29:20.077 --> 29:23.047
Well, if you knew my son,
you'd know how dark he can be.

29:24.982 --> 29:28.118
I guess I only know the happy,
light side of Roderick.

29:28.485 --> 29:29.820
We all have two sides...

29:30.120 --> 29:31.355
Don't we Miss Segal?

29:32.122 --> 29:33.223
I suppose.

29:37.528 --> 29:39.463
Will your father be joining us?

29:39.496 --> 29:40.497
No, he's too sick.

29:40.699 --> 29:42.366
You'll get to meet
my brother Gordon.

29:42.399 --> 29:43.635
You have a brother?

29:43.668 --> 29:44.868
Yeah.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.538
What else don't
I know about you?

29:48.305 --> 29:50.107
Good evening all.

29:50.140 --> 29:53.444
Ah, Doctor Phillips,
Miss Morgan... Segal.

29:53.477 --> 29:55.145
Miss... Segal.

29:56.013 --> 29:57.214
Doctor.

29:57.247 --> 29:59.216
Doctor Phillips has been our
family physician for many years.

29:59.249 --> 30:00.317
And his father before him.

30:00.351 --> 30:01.452
Isn't that right Doctor?

30:01.485 --> 30:04.421
Our families do indeed have
a long history together.

30:04.922 --> 30:09.093
Miss Segal, on the other hand,
has been Roderick's girl-friend

30:09.126 --> 30:11.161
for only a few months.

30:11.195 --> 30:12.996
Apparently they met in college.

30:13.030 --> 30:15.866
Met my first wife in college.

30:16.333 --> 30:19.169
Married ten years. Decade.

30:20.204 --> 30:22.339
And she disappeared.

30:22.873 --> 30:26.243
Left one day
without saying a word.

30:28.379 --> 30:31.148
How is our patient
this evening Doctor?

30:31.181 --> 30:33.550
As well as can be expected.

30:33.818 --> 30:35.319
He's resting comfortably.

30:35.653 --> 30:37.655
Resting comfortably.

30:37.689 --> 30:40.592
I hope we can all expect to rest
comfortably on our death bed.

30:40.625 --> 30:42.159
To resting comfortably.

30:42.192 --> 30:44.395
Mother, that's a rather
ghastly thing to say.

30:44.796 --> 30:47.464
On the contrary,
I'm completely sincere.

30:47.498 --> 30:50.934
And why not? He deserves to rest
comfortably before he passes on!

30:51.268 --> 30:53.303
To... resting comfortably.

31:00.344 --> 31:02.513
It's so sad your father has to
go through all this at such

31:02.546 --> 31:03.547
a young age.

31:03.581 --> 31:05.983
Oh, he's not that young.

31:06.016 --> 31:07.251
No?

31:07.284 --> 31:09.253
I guess I just assumed he was
because your mother is so young.

31:09.286 --> 31:12.289
Uh, Father is one
hundred years old.

31:12.891 --> 31:15.058
Your father is a hundred?

31:15.092 --> 31:16.093
Yeah.

31:17.094 --> 31:18.395
And your mother is?

31:18.429 --> 31:19.697
She's forty-five.

31:20.598 --> 31:22.567
It... it's weird, I know.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.635
And you're...

31:23.668 --> 31:26.437
Do the math.

31:26.470 --> 31:28.740
So. Your father was
seventy-eight

31:28.773 --> 31:30.307
when you were born?

31:30.340 --> 31:31.175
Hmm-umm.

31:31.208 --> 31:34.612
- And your mother was...
- Twenty-four.

31:34.646 --> 31:35.680
Oh.

31:38.949 --> 31:40.517
Madam...

31:41.018 --> 31:43.387
Dinner is served.

32:07.377 --> 32:08.646
This looks delicious Vincent.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.180
Thank you, sir.

32:12.382 --> 32:14.184
Thank you.

32:21.793 --> 32:26.029
Morgan, this is my
older brother Gordon.

32:26.063 --> 32:28.098
Hello.

32:28.131 --> 32:30.200
Can you say hello Gordon?

32:31.168 --> 32:32.169
Hellow.

32:32.402 --> 32:33.771
Gordon got new gloves today.

32:33.805 --> 32:36.206
He keeps the grounds.
Actually, he grew those flowers

32:36.240 --> 32:37.742
over there.

32:37.775 --> 32:39.309
They're very pretty.

32:40.110 --> 32:41.713
Yes, thank you.

32:42.012 --> 32:43.514
So. Miss Segal-

32:43.547 --> 32:45.583
Morgan, you can call me Morgan.

32:46.550 --> 32:47.719
Morgan...

32:47.752 --> 32:50.320
As our special guest this
evening, perhaps you'd like to

32:50.354 --> 32:52.155
say grace.

32:52.189 --> 32:53.591
Grace?

32:53.625 --> 32:54.592
Grace.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.226
A blessing before dinner.

32:56.694 --> 32:58.295
Please.
Pick something from the Bible.

32:58.328 --> 32:59.296
Mother.

32:59.329 --> 33:00.330
What?

33:00.665 --> 33:03.467
Please don't put Morgan
on the spot like this.

33:04.434 --> 33:05.837
I'm sorry.

33:05.870 --> 33:08.773
I didn't realize I was putting
someone on the spot. I...

33:08.806 --> 33:11.508
...simply thought she might
like to say grace.

33:11.542 --> 33:13.176
Maybe she's religious.

33:13.210 --> 33:14.545
I wouldn't know because you

33:14.579 --> 33:16.581
haven't told me
anything about her.

33:16.614 --> 33:17.649
It's okay Roderick.

33:18.683 --> 33:19.817
I can say grace.

33:21.151 --> 33:22.554
No, Mother is teasing again.

33:22.787 --> 33:24.722
Aren't you... Mother?

33:25.757 --> 33:27.357
No.

33:27.391 --> 33:29.293
I am not teasing.

33:30.628 --> 33:31.663
Please...

33:32.062 --> 33:34.197
Pick something from the Bible.

33:56.186 --> 33:57.722
Um...

34:02.694 --> 34:04.662
Anytime dear.

34:07.464 --> 34:10.500
"And when he had opened the
seventh seal, there was silence

34:10.534 --> 34:12.570
in heaven about the space of
half an hour-"

34:12.603 --> 34:15.138
Good lord, not Revelations!

34:15.172 --> 34:16.608
Pick something else.

34:20.510 --> 34:23.413
"And when he learned that Jesus
was to be crucified...

34:23.447 --> 34:26.416
Judas attempted to return the
money he had been paid for

34:26.449 --> 34:28.585
his betrayal and...

34:28.620 --> 34:31.623
...attempted suicide by
hanging."

34:31.856 --> 34:33.322
And we're done!

34:33.558 --> 34:34.792
Amen!

34:34.826 --> 34:36.561
You sure know how to pick 'em.

34:36.594 --> 34:37.728
Amen.

34:37.762 --> 34:39.463
Aaaaaa mennnnnnn.

34:40.797 --> 34:43.233
I'm sorry, I'm really
not very religious.

34:43.266 --> 34:44.702
No it's... it's okay.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.572
It's okay.

34:51.943 --> 34:53.811
Roderick used to be.

34:54.210 --> 34:56.513
You should have
seen him as a little boy...

34:57.081 --> 34:59.483
his little hands pressed
together...

34:59.951 --> 35:02.486
...his head bowed in prayer.

35:03.755 --> 35:04.922
Come on!

35:04.956 --> 35:06.156
Let me hear it!

35:06.490 --> 35:08.291
Let me hear you say it!

35:08.325 --> 35:10.695
Let me hear you say you
love the baby Jesus!

35:14.431 --> 35:16.433
But not anymore.

35:17.001 --> 35:19.236
I tried to raise
him as a good Catholic.

35:19.269 --> 35:21.806
Tried to instill
all the holy sacraments.

35:22.073 --> 35:24.307
The Ushers have been good
Catholics for generations.

35:24.341 --> 35:25.743
Isn't that right Mother?

35:27.277 --> 35:29.479
When was the last time you
went to confession?

35:29.513 --> 35:32.516
That's between me and God.

35:33.051 --> 35:36.386
I believe religion is a matter
that should be personal.

35:37.622 --> 35:40.257
Between the person and their...

35:41.324 --> 35:43.460
god... of... choice.

35:48.331 --> 35:49.533
What about you Doctor Phillips?

35:49.801 --> 35:51.401
I don't believe
you're a man of faith.

35:51.435 --> 35:53.470
I'm a man of science Lady Usher.

35:54.271 --> 35:55.272
Here! Here!

35:55.640 --> 35:57.207
To science!

36:06.516 --> 36:07.585
Vincent...

36:08.518 --> 36:09.787
That dress needs a shawl.

36:10.021 --> 36:11.421
Too much skin.

36:11.789 --> 36:12.790
Yes madam.

36:13.091 --> 36:14.524
And pass the asparagus.

36:21.699 --> 36:23.467
So, Morgan...

36:23.868 --> 36:27.270
Since my son has failed to
tell us anything about you...

36:27.572 --> 36:29.539
...perhaps you could tell
us about yourself.

36:30.041 --> 36:31.909
Well, I'm from Indiana
originally.

36:32.342 --> 36:33.711
Ah, the Hoosier state.

36:33.945 --> 36:36.279
Yes sir, home of James Dean.

36:36.313 --> 36:37.547
And Michael Jackson.

36:37.582 --> 36:38.649
Yes ma'am.

36:38.683 --> 36:40.718
Both my parents
were born and raised.

36:40.952 --> 36:41.986
My mother was a maid.

36:42.220 --> 36:43.520
My father's a baker.

36:43.855 --> 36:45.388
Good hard-working people.

36:45.422 --> 36:46.724
I knew it.

36:46.758 --> 36:48.325
Yes ma'am.

36:48.659 --> 36:49.794
Your father's a baker.

36:50.228 --> 36:52.395
He specializes in pastries
and...

36:52.429 --> 36:53.564
...desserts.

36:53.765 --> 36:55.532
Does he? Is he any good?

36:55.566 --> 36:57.034
Oh, the best in Muncie.

36:57.267 --> 37:00.403
Well then, I'm sure you'll give
Vincent here an honest opinion

37:00.437 --> 37:01.404
of your desserts.

37:01.438 --> 37:02.339
Oh, yes ma'am.

37:02.607 --> 37:05.408
Your mother was a maid you said,
what does she do now?

37:05.643 --> 37:06.677
She's passed.

37:07.879 --> 37:09.412
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:09.446 --> 37:10.748
Thank you.

37:11.115 --> 37:13.785
So you've experienced
the death of a parent then?

37:14.185 --> 37:15.553
Yes, ma'am, I have.

37:16.286 --> 37:18.790
I'm sure, that's why you felt
the need to be here for my son.

37:19.056 --> 37:20.958
I suppose so.

37:20.992 --> 37:23.661
I just thought he could use
a friend at a time like this.

37:23.694 --> 37:24.829
A girl-friend you mean.

37:26.564 --> 37:28.431
You made it clear earlier that
you are here as his girl-friend.

37:28.465 --> 37:31.035
- Mother.
- What son?

37:31.235 --> 37:33.403
Are you teasing
again Mrs. Usher?

37:33.436 --> 37:35.405
No, Morgan. I'm not teasing.

37:35.438 --> 37:38.408
I'd simply like a little
information about my son

37:38.441 --> 37:39.944
and his girlfriend's
relationship.

37:39.977 --> 37:41.879
I'd like you to
clarify the question.

37:41.913 --> 37:43.881
You came here
tonight as his girl-friend...

37:43.915 --> 37:44.916
Yes?

37:45.482 --> 37:46.449
Yes.

37:46.483 --> 37:47.517
Mother!

37:47.819 --> 37:49.352
It's okay.

37:49.687 --> 37:51.689
Yes Roderick. It's okay.

37:52.190 --> 37:54.659
I came here, Mrs. Usher...

37:54.692 --> 37:57.795
to be of comfort and solace
for my boy-friend during this

37:57.829 --> 37:58.863
difficult time.

37:58.896 --> 38:00.064
You see.

38:00.097 --> 38:02.834
She's more than capable of
answering the question herself.

38:02.867 --> 38:04.569
She's a very capable woman.

38:04.769 --> 38:06.369
To capable women.

38:10.942 --> 38:12.610
She's too good for you.

38:35.833 --> 38:36.801
So.

38:36.834 --> 38:38.636
How did you two meet?

38:39.971 --> 38:41.504
We met at a party.

38:41.538 --> 38:42.907
A party?

38:43.140 --> 38:45.475
And here I thought I sent
you off to college to study.

38:46.443 --> 38:47.510
Did you go home with him?

38:48.713 --> 38:49.914
No ma'am.

38:49.947 --> 38:51.983
He was quite charming though.

38:52.016 --> 38:53.450
Weren't you?

38:53.818 --> 38:56.554
He walked me back to my dorm
to make sure I was safe.

38:57.154 --> 38:58.623
Very charming.

38:58.956 --> 39:00.591
Very chivalrous.

39:01.058 --> 39:02.525
I taught you well.

39:04.494 --> 39:05.462
You having sex?

39:11.802 --> 39:13.137
You okay?

39:20.578 --> 39:22.512
Yes. Thank you.

39:28.653 --> 39:30.520
- Well?
- Mother! That's enough!

39:30.554 --> 39:31.622
No!

39:31.656 --> 39:34.191
I would like some information
about my son and his

39:34.225 --> 39:35.760
girl-friend's relationship!

39:35.793 --> 39:37.561
Then ask me!

39:37.595 --> 39:38.596
Fine...
Roderick.

39:39.363 --> 39:40.932
Are you having
sex with this girl?

39:41.531 --> 39:43.701
It's none of your business!

39:43.734 --> 39:45.703
And even if it was it certainly
isn't a conversation to have at

39:45.736 --> 39:46.871
the dinner table!

39:46.904 --> 39:49.874
You'll do well to mind your
place in this house, son.

39:49.907 --> 39:52.877
I will decide what is and is not
appropriate to discuss at my

39:52.910 --> 39:55.212
dinner table!

39:55.246 --> 39:57.581
Perhaps a different topic of
conversation would suit you

39:57.615 --> 40:01.652
better, hmmm?

40:01.686 --> 40:03.587
Do I make myself clear?

40:03.854 --> 40:05.189
Yes ma'am.

40:12.697 --> 40:13.597
Now...

40:13.631 --> 40:15.933
...judging by the
response to my query,

40:15.967 --> 40:17.635
I will assume the affirmative.

40:17.668 --> 40:19.570
Are you using protection?

40:20.537 --> 40:21.906
- Yes, Mrs. Usher.
- Morgan -

40:22.640 --> 40:23.908
It's okay.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.878
We don't need
any heirs to this house.

40:30.214 --> 40:32.616
We are using protection.

40:32.650 --> 40:33.751
Good.

40:34.517 --> 40:38.189
If not, perhaps Doctor Philips
here can give you an exam and

40:38.222 --> 40:39.757
prescribe something.

40:39.790 --> 40:41.192
He's done well
by me for many years.

40:41.726 --> 40:43.694
I have two sons and...

40:44.996 --> 40:45.997
Well.

40:46.297 --> 40:48.099
...one and a half.

40:49.066 --> 40:50.601
Pass the salt dear.

40:56.674 --> 40:58.242
You're welcome
to stay the night

40:58.275 --> 40:59.877
but I think it would
be best for all,

40:59.910 --> 41:02.279
if you left first thing in
the morning.

41:02.313 --> 41:03.280
Have I offended you?

41:03.314 --> 41:05.616
- Morgan...
- No.

41:05.649 --> 41:07.785
I think I'm owed an explanation.

41:12.923 --> 41:17.628
You came here unannounced.
Uninvited, I might add.

41:18.229 --> 41:20.264
Roderick told you it
wasn't a good time to come

41:20.297 --> 41:22.199
and yet you came anyway.

41:22.233 --> 41:27.238
Now, I understand you feel that
by being here you're doing him

41:27.838 --> 41:30.207
I can take care of my son.

41:30.841 --> 41:32.910
I think you came here for
selfish reasons-

41:32.943 --> 41:34.578
- I only-
- Ahhh!

41:35.312 --> 41:37.748
You asked for an
explanation Miss Segal,

41:37.782 --> 41:40.184
I'm giving it to you.

41:40.217 --> 41:42.153
You came to this house of your
own accord,

41:42.186 --> 41:45.156
knowing that this was an
extremely difficult time and

41:45.189 --> 41:47.591
yet you gave no thought as to
how your presence would

41:47.625 --> 41:49.126
affect our household!

41:49.160 --> 41:51.595
My husband, Mister Usher,
Roderick's father,

41:51.629 --> 41:53.264
lies in his bed dying.

41:53.297 --> 41:55.800
Frankly, Miss Segal, you have
shown poor judgement,

41:55.833 --> 41:57.701
your timing is simply dreadful,

41:57.735 --> 42:01.806
and I will not mention your
lack of social etiquette!

42:01.839 --> 42:06.844
Frankly, you are not
welcome in my house...

42:07.111 --> 42:08.312
At this time.

42:14.085 --> 42:16.587
I'm sure if things were
different...

42:16.854 --> 42:18.956
...under different
circumstances...

42:19.723 --> 42:21.025
...it would be fine.

42:28.866 --> 42:31.102
I, I heard yelling!
AHHH! AHHH!

42:31.135 --> 42:32.970
Roderick, give me a hand!

42:33.938 --> 42:37.908
AHHHH.

42:39.143 --> 42:42.079
AHHHH.

42:43.347 --> 42:45.116
You see Miss Segal?!

42:45.149 --> 42:48.085
I'm sure you'd agree, that
it would be best if you left...

42:48.119 --> 42:50.654
...first thing in the morning.

42:53.958 --> 42:55.960
Ahhhh... Ahhhh.

43:31.829 --> 43:33.831
Fuck that bitch.

44:56.981 --> 44:57.982
Roderick?

44:58.415 --> 44:59.416
Morgan?

45:07.024 --> 45:09.093
You okay?

45:17.034 --> 45:18.135
How's your father?

45:19.003 --> 45:21.005
He's resting now.

45:22.106 --> 45:23.407
Poor thing.

45:23.708 --> 45:25.943
I really didn't think we
were being that loud.

45:26.210 --> 45:29.079
He's very susceptible to noise.

45:29.113 --> 45:32.216
To anything really. It's his...

45:32.783 --> 45:35.819
...morbid acuteness of the
senses.

45:36.588 --> 45:38.355
It's part of his illness...

45:38.723 --> 45:40.391
...his mental illness.

45:44.361 --> 45:45.563
What about Gordon?

45:45.597 --> 45:47.097
He'll be fine.

45:47.798 --> 45:50.234
I told you it would be
unnerving.

45:52.202 --> 45:53.504
I'm so sorry.

45:53.537 --> 45:55.205
It's not your fault.

46:00.377 --> 46:05.382
Your mother does
not like me, does she?

46:06.950 --> 46:09.286
My mother is...

46:10.020 --> 46:11.021
...touched.

46:12.990 --> 46:14.058
What does that mean?

46:16.226 --> 46:18.996
It means she can be a little...
intense.

46:20.331 --> 46:21.599
A little?

46:21.865 --> 46:24.535
I'm sorry she embarrassed you.

46:27.004 --> 46:31.342
I think she embarrassed
you more than me.

46:31.710 --> 46:34.211
Ah, no. I'm used to it.

46:34.746 --> 46:36.880
Has it always been that way?

46:40.250 --> 46:41.552
Uh. In a way.

46:41.786 --> 46:44.254
I think it has become more
concentrated due to my father's

46:44.288 --> 46:46.990
illness.

46:47.024 --> 46:49.326
Sorry you had to meet my father
that way. Kind of a...

46:49.661 --> 46:51.395
...grand entrance.

46:52.930 --> 46:54.431
Scared the shit out of me.

46:55.667 --> 46:56.900
I just wish I
could take it all back.

46:56.934 --> 47:00.404
This whole evening. I wouldn't
want you to only have a sick old

47:00.437 --> 47:03.073
man as your image of him.

47:03.107 --> 47:04.108
I won't.

47:05.175 --> 47:08.379
Maybe, you could show
me pictures or something.

47:10.381 --> 47:12.249
Yeah.

47:12.282 --> 47:13.384
That's a good idea.

47:14.485 --> 47:15.486
In the morning.

47:18.288 --> 47:20.491
But your mother wants
me gone in the morning.

47:20.792 --> 47:22.660
First thing she said.

47:25.329 --> 47:28.031
I'll speak to her.

47:28.432 --> 47:30.300
Don't.

47:30.668 --> 47:32.704
That's the last thing I want to
do is get in-between you and

47:32.737 --> 47:34.371
your mother.

47:34.405 --> 47:36.540
My mother can
be very strong willed.

47:37.675 --> 47:40.511
We've been
through a lot together.

47:43.180 --> 47:44.381
I've got an idea.

47:45.416 --> 47:47.217
Read me something.

47:49.186 --> 47:50.254
What?

47:50.287 --> 47:51.422
Read me one of your books.

47:51.455 --> 47:53.157
Any of them. Just pick one.

48:14.445 --> 48:18.115
When our two souls
stand up erect and strong...

48:18.148 --> 48:20.217
Face to face, silent...

48:20.451 --> 48:22.386
...drawing nigh and nigher.

48:23.153 --> 48:26.591
Until the lengthening wings
break into fire at either curved

48:26.624 --> 48:27.859
point...

48:27.892 --> 48:30.662
What bitter wrong can the earth
do to us, that we should not

48:30.695 --> 48:34.298
long be here contented?

48:34.331 --> 48:35.966
Think.

48:36.533 --> 48:40.237
In mounting higher, the angels
would press on us and aspire to

48:40.270 --> 48:41.773
drop some golden orb

48:41.806 --> 48:45.442
of perfect song into our deep,
dear silence.

48:45.743 --> 48:47.712
Let us stay
rather on earth, beloved...

48:47.912 --> 48:51.448
where the unfit contrarious
moods of men recoil away and

48:51.482 --> 48:53.484
isolate pure spirits...

48:53.517 --> 48:57.187
and permit a place to
stand and love in for a day...

48:58.121 --> 49:02.326
...with darkness and the
death-hour rounding it.

50:51.736 --> 50:53.503
Mother.

50:54.338 --> 50:57.642
- What?
- Did?

50:57.675 --> 50:59.677
- What?
- Did you just call me... mother?

51:00.912 --> 51:02.279
I, no...

51:02.312 --> 51:05.215
I- I-I... didn't.

51:05.248 --> 51:06.383
Did I?

51:06.851 --> 51:09.386
No, I, I said Morgan.

51:09.419 --> 51:12.456
I'm pretty sure just you called
me mother.

51:12.824 --> 51:15.359
No. I don... I don't think I did.

51:15.392 --> 51:17.227
No, I... I... I didn't.

51:17.729 --> 51:19.162
Okay boo.

51:20.031 --> 51:23.333
I'm just gonna chalk this up
to, it's been a really long

51:23.367 --> 51:24.702
fucking day...

51:24.736 --> 51:26.136
...and...

51:26.904 --> 51:28.606
...I'm just gonna
go back to my room.

51:28.640 --> 51:32.275
Morgan, please...

51:32.309 --> 51:34.712
No, no, no it's,
it's okay. Just...

51:34.912 --> 51:36.413
I'll see you in the morning.

51:36.446 --> 51:37.547
Morgan... I, I...

51:37.582 --> 51:39.149
Shhhh...

51:50.227 --> 51:51.495
Mother?

51:51.528 --> 51:52.930
What the fuck?

51:54.599 --> 51:56.233
Really?

52:35.505 --> 52:37.474
Lady Usher?

52:43.047 --> 52:45.616
Welcome to my house.

55:25.877 --> 55:27.912
Have you seen her?

55:28.946 --> 55:32.817
Are you alright Mr. Usher?

55:32.850 --> 55:35.820
You haven't seen her then?

55:35.853 --> 55:37.822
Who?

55:37.855 --> 55:39.156
She's there!

55:39.522 --> 55:40.892
Come, come!

55:41.391 --> 55:43.160
See, see for yourself!

55:50.768 --> 55:53.638
I'm sorry Mister Usher,
I don't see anyone there.

55:54.605 --> 55:56.040
Madeline.

55:58.109 --> 56:00.044
Let's just get you back to bed.

56:00.378 --> 56:02.580
Ma-Ma-Madeline!

56:03.714 --> 56:05.716
I'm Morgan.

56:06.951 --> 56:09.552
Don't worry,
you've had a long day.

56:09.587 --> 56:11.454
Let's just get you back to bed.

56:11.488 --> 56:12.924
Get you resting.

56:15.059 --> 56:19.130
Oh, please... don't let the
blankets touch my skin.

56:20.031 --> 56:21.498
I'm so sorry.

56:22.499 --> 56:23.901
Is that okay?

56:23.935 --> 56:25.002
Please...

56:25.202 --> 56:26.804
I must see my daughter.

56:27.004 --> 56:28.806
I must speak to her.

56:30.608 --> 56:33.177
I don't think I've
met her yet, Mr. Usher.

56:33.978 --> 56:37.248
Can I... call the
doctor or your wife?

56:37.281 --> 56:41.152
Ah. No. I've suffered enough.

56:41.185 --> 56:43.220
I want to see Madeline.

56:45.222 --> 56:49.593
Well. Everyone's asleep.
It's really late, Mister Usher.

56:50.161 --> 56:52.596
I'll see what I can do first
thing in the morning but for

56:52.630 --> 56:54.799
now you need to rest.

56:54.832 --> 56:56.734
I dread...

56:57.301 --> 57:00.972
...the events of the future.

57:02.106 --> 57:05.710
Not the future themselves but...

57:06.243 --> 57:08.779
...rather the results.

57:13.684 --> 57:15.286
Should I get call doctor?

57:15.319 --> 57:19.991
No, I shudder at the thought
of any incident...

57:20.358 --> 57:23.094
...no matter how trivial.

57:23.127 --> 57:24.762
All of this...
...this...

57:25.396 --> 57:30.601
...in-intolerable
agitation to my soul.

57:31.068 --> 57:35.940
I believe that
the period will arrive...

57:36.539 --> 57:39.744
...when I must abandon...

57:39.777 --> 57:40.811
...this life...

57:41.912 --> 57:46.017
...and reason
with the grim phantasm.

57:46.050 --> 57:48.085
You'll be fine Mister Usher.

57:48.486 --> 57:50.621
That won't happen anytime soon.

57:51.122 --> 57:52.690
The gloom...

57:52.890 --> 57:55.726
...that has inflicted my
heart...

57:55.760 --> 57:57.228
...is more natural...

57:57.428 --> 58:01.932
...and more
palpa-palpable of origin.

58:02.532 --> 58:05.703
My decease will be welcome...

58:06.337 --> 58:07.938
...with a bitterness...

58:08.305 --> 58:10.741
...that the
last of the Ushers...

58:12.076 --> 58:13.878
...is near.

58:14.078 --> 58:16.614
You're not the
last of the Ushers.

58:16.647 --> 58:18.015
There's Roderick.

58:18.749 --> 58:20.550
Well, perhaps...

58:21.085 --> 58:22.653
...when he's grown...

58:23.654 --> 58:24.822
...an adult...

58:26.157 --> 58:29.827
...he will carry on
the House of Usher.

58:30.294 --> 58:31.328
But...

58:31.362 --> 58:32.763
...I fear...

58:33.964 --> 58:35.666
...that the disease...

58:36.367 --> 58:39.170
...and the evil of the family...

58:40.204 --> 58:42.039
...shall follow him.

58:43.374 --> 58:44.742
What disease?

58:45.543 --> 58:48.879
A host of unnatural
sensations...

58:48.913 --> 58:53.918
...of which I've long suffered.

58:54.318 --> 58:59.323
Morbid acuteness of senses.
Even of food alone is endurable.

59:00.991 --> 59:05.696
I must wear certain
garments of fabric.

59:05.729 --> 59:07.731
Odors oppress me.

59:07.965 --> 59:11.001
My eyes are tormented...

59:11.035 --> 59:13.204
...with even the faintest light.

59:14.705 --> 59:18.209
Res-ponding sounds...

59:18.742 --> 59:21.378
...in-in-inspire me...

59:21.412 --> 59:23.314
...with horror.

59:25.182 --> 59:27.685
What this family needs...

59:28.385 --> 59:33.390
...is new blood.
Or this un-godly disease...

59:33.691 --> 59:37.361
...will pass on and pass down.

59:38.796 --> 59:41.398
I'm afraid my daughter...

59:41.432 --> 59:46.103
...has already
passed it down to her son.

59:47.004 --> 59:48.806
This apathy...

59:49.006 --> 59:51.842
...the gradual waste...

59:52.510 --> 59:55.112
...and the decay of this house.

59:57.248 --> 01:00:00.751
In the greenest of our valleys,

01:00:01.218 --> 01:00:04.889
By good angels tenanted,

01:00:05.489 --> 01:00:10.694
Once a fair and stately palace-

01:00:11.262 --> 01:00:13.931
Radiant palace-

01:00:14.899 --> 01:00:16.967
...reared its head.

01:00:17.401 --> 01:00:21.405
In the monarch's
thought's dominion-

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:26.177
Never seraph spread a pinion,

01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:28.779
Over fabric...

01:00:28.812 --> 01:00:30.481
...half so fair.

01:00:30.514 --> 01:00:34.952
This Haunted palace.
Let us mourn...

01:00:35.519 --> 01:00:38.756
...for never morrow.

01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:46.130
Did you write that?

01:00:47.831 --> 01:00:49.733
Perhaps.

01:00:50.868 --> 01:00:52.403
Perhaps?

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:54.138
Yes.

01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:56.006
You...!

01:00:56.207 --> 01:00:57.208
...are what...

01:00:57.241 --> 01:00:59.210
...the House of Usher needs.

01:01:17.428 --> 01:01:21.198
What happened?!
What did you do?!

01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:23.801
Help me lay him.

01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:26.437
Morgan, what is going on?

01:01:26.705 --> 01:01:27.938
I can't.

01:01:32.176 --> 01:01:33.510
Shut the door.

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:51.128
Dear husband.

01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:53.964
Time to sleep.

01:01:56.568 --> 01:01:59.236
Travelers now in the valley,

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:02.006
Through red-litten windows, See
the...

01:02:02.039 --> 01:02:06.543
many forms moving fantastically
to a discordant melody;

01:02:07.444 --> 01:02:09.913
Like a rapid ghastly river,

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:14.818
Through a pale door, the hideous
throngs rush out forever,

01:02:15.219 --> 01:02:16.253
And laugh...

01:02:17.454 --> 01:02:19.123
...but smile no more.

01:03:37.267 --> 01:03:38.268
I have to go.

01:03:38.969 --> 01:03:40.137
Morning.

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.238
Would you like some breakfast?

01:03:41.271 --> 01:03:42.473
You were right I
shouldn't have come.

01:03:42.506 --> 01:03:43.941
This has been a huge mistake.

01:03:43.974 --> 01:03:45.442
It hasn't been a huge mistake.

01:03:45.476 --> 01:03:47.211
Just let me finish.

01:03:47.478 --> 01:03:48.545
It has been a mistake.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.648
Your mother can't stand me,
you're father is dying.

01:03:50.682 --> 01:03:54.118
- And I have to-
- My father is dead.

01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:57.254
My father is dead.
He died last night of...

01:03:57.287 --> 01:03:59.289
...natural causes.

01:03:59.323 --> 01:04:01.626
Roderick, I'm so sorry.

01:04:01.659 --> 01:04:03.460
I don't know what to say.

01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:05.597
There's nothing to say really.

01:04:07.364 --> 01:04:09.299
Well, what happened?

01:04:09.701 --> 01:04:12.035
After you left his
room, he just...

01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:15.239
...closed his eyes
and stopped breathing.

01:04:19.143 --> 01:04:21.211
Well, you were all by his side
when he passed.

01:04:21.245 --> 01:04:24.047
Guess that's a
good thing, right?

01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:29.086
Yes... a good thing.

01:04:30.187 --> 01:04:32.289
This isn't the best timing...

01:04:32.322 --> 01:04:35.092
...but I don't know when I'll
get a chance to say this again.

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:38.095
There's something I've been
meaning to tell you.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.433
I'm going to Paris
next semester.

01:04:43.701 --> 01:04:45.670
Wow. Um.

01:04:46.203 --> 01:04:48.706
How long have you
been planning this?

01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:50.407
For awhile.

01:04:50.608 --> 01:04:52.309
And I'm so sorry I didn't tell
you sooner.

01:04:52.342 --> 01:04:55.245
I've wanted to tell you, but
I-just couldn't bring myself to.

01:04:55.479 --> 01:04:56.480
Why Paris?

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.716
I got a scholarship.

01:05:00.217 --> 01:05:01.351
Well...

01:05:01.786 --> 01:05:02.986
...congratulations.

01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:05.088
When do you leave?

01:05:05.557 --> 01:05:07.725
In a few weeks.

01:05:07.759 --> 01:05:11.428
And um, I wanted to spend those
weeks with you, but...

01:05:11.462 --> 01:05:13.598
...after last night,
I don't see that happening.

01:05:15.232 --> 01:05:17.134
Neither do I.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:19.136
Especially after last night.

01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:22.172
Mrs. Usher, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

01:05:22.206 --> 01:05:25.275
Thank you.

01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:28.378
I see you're all packed.
Are you leaving then?

01:05:28.412 --> 01:05:32.416
As you said,
I think it's best that I leave.

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:33.550
Well...

01:05:33.585 --> 01:05:35.653
...we're entombing my husband
later this afternoon.

01:05:35.687 --> 01:05:37.221
If you'd like to stay...

01:05:37.254 --> 01:05:38.522
...for Roderick's sake...

01:05:38.756 --> 01:05:40.457
I suppose that would be alright.

01:05:42.493 --> 01:05:44.762
Would you like me to stay,
Roderick?

01:05:46.798 --> 01:05:48.999
Thank you, Mother.

01:05:51.235 --> 01:05:53.303
Of course you'll
have to change that dress

01:05:53.337 --> 01:05:55.573
...it's absolutely appalling.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.208
Of course.

01:07:18.856 --> 01:07:20.725
Our dear departed.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.594
Grandfather...

01:07:22.627 --> 01:07:23.828
...father...

01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:25.262
...husband.

01:07:26.196 --> 01:07:28.600
He gave us all so much.

01:07:29.433 --> 01:07:30.802
Rest now.

01:08:32.863 --> 01:08:34.698
Hello Gordon.

01:08:37.466 --> 01:08:41.606
I'm sorry we didn't really get
to know each other at dinner.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.676
I'll be leaving soon.

01:08:45.442 --> 01:08:46.475
And...

01:08:47.477 --> 01:08:50.615
...well I just wanted to say
it was really nice to meet you.

01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:54.852
F-F-For you...

01:08:55.886 --> 01:08:57.453
Mmmmorrgan.

01:08:57.755 --> 01:08:58.790
That's right.

01:08:59.122 --> 01:09:00.692
I'm Morgan.

01:09:01.893 --> 01:09:03.193
I'm...

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.194
Gorrrrrdaaannnnnn.

01:09:05.962 --> 01:09:07.264
You're Gordan...

01:09:07.464 --> 01:09:08.532
...I'm Morgan.

01:09:10.332 --> 01:09:14.906
Yoooo haaaavvvvvv a pretty
f-f-f-faaaace.

01:09:16.372 --> 01:09:17.575
Thank you.

01:09:18.643 --> 01:09:20.678
Is everything alright in here?

01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:21.879
Yes.

01:09:22.312 --> 01:09:24.816
Gordon was just giving
me this lovely flower.

01:09:25.015 --> 01:09:28.385
And pretty f-f-faaaaace.

01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:30.787
Oh, and he says
I have a pretty face.

01:09:31.321 --> 01:09:33.624
That's very nice of you Gordon.

01:09:33.658 --> 01:09:34.792
Very nice.

01:09:35.827 --> 01:09:38.495
I hope to see you again soon.

01:09:56.814 --> 01:09:58.850
It was a nice service.

01:09:59.516 --> 01:10:04.321
Very fashionable, but nice.

01:10:05.089 --> 01:10:08.993
I appreciate you staying,
especially after last night.

01:10:11.428 --> 01:10:12.964
I've got an idea.

01:10:14.966 --> 01:10:16.533
Come with me.

01:10:18.002 --> 01:10:19.837
Back to school?

01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:21.839
No, to Paris. Come on.

01:10:21.873 --> 01:10:22.774
To Paris.

01:10:22.807 --> 01:10:27.044
What better place
to read, paint? Write?

01:10:27.078 --> 01:10:30.514
I-I-I can't leave now.
My mother needs me here.

01:10:31.015 --> 01:10:32.049
I'm.

01:10:32.382 --> 01:10:33.918
I'm pretty sure
she'll be just fine.

01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:36.053
Look, I'm concerned about you!

01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:37.588
About us!

01:10:38.122 --> 01:10:40.357
There's nothing wrong with us.

01:10:41.458 --> 01:10:45.362
There won't be if we leave.

01:10:45.395 --> 01:10:50.467
Look, I've been thinking,
really thinking so just listen.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.936
If we want to have a
relationship,

01:10:51.969 --> 01:10:54.071
I know we can have...

01:10:54.105 --> 01:10:56.306
...we have to leave.

01:10:56.574 --> 01:10:58.910
We have to leave this house.

01:10:59.243 --> 01:11:01.012
We need each other.

01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:06.550
So, please don't let pride
or ego or your mother...

01:11:06.584 --> 01:11:11.589
...keep you from - Keep us...!
from being together.

01:11:12.455 --> 01:11:14.625
Roderick,

01:11:14.659 --> 01:11:16.961
Roderick, I love you.

01:11:21.531 --> 01:11:23.868
Your father said something
to me last night.

01:11:23.901 --> 01:11:25.102
He said...

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:29.372
There needs to be new blood
in the House of Usher.

01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:31.408
He said that?

01:11:33.177 --> 01:11:35.445
I think he wanted
us to be together.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.348
Those were
his words, new blood?

01:11:38.616 --> 01:11:42.485
Yes. I think he could sense how
strong my feelings are for you.

01:11:43.154 --> 01:11:44.722
Roderick!

01:11:45.756 --> 01:11:48.025
Roderick, I need you.

01:11:49.794 --> 01:11:52.730
Please, I need you now.

01:11:52.964 --> 01:11:54.364
I need you now.

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.703
I'll be right in.

01:12:03.641 --> 01:12:04.609
Okay.

01:12:06.177 --> 01:12:07.510
Okay.

01:12:07.544 --> 01:12:08.545
Okay?

01:12:08.779 --> 01:12:11.582
I'll meet you there, in France.

01:12:11.949 --> 01:12:14.785
No. Roderick, you need
to come with me now.

01:12:15.253 --> 01:12:18.089
I can't right now. As I said,
she needs me here.

01:12:18.122 --> 01:12:19.590
I'll come in a week or so.

01:12:19.624 --> 01:12:21.192
Your mother is one of the
strongest women I know.

01:12:21.225 --> 01:12:22.660
She'll be fine.

01:12:22.693 --> 01:12:24.595
You have to leave with me today.

01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:28.699
I promise I'll come to Paris.

01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:29.800
Roderick...

01:12:29.834 --> 01:12:31.736
...if you don't leave with me
today, you won't come.

01:12:31.769 --> 01:12:33.871
She won't let you come.

01:12:33.905 --> 01:12:35.973
You have to leave with me today.

01:12:40.011 --> 01:12:42.580
Please, come with me.

01:12:44.582 --> 01:12:45.983
Tonight.

01:12:46.384 --> 01:12:48.886
I'll leave with you tonight.
You're already packed...

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.688
...wait in the woods near the
main gate.

01:12:50.721 --> 01:12:52.556
I'll pack and then
sneak out tonight.

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:53.758
We'll go together.

01:12:54.659 --> 01:12:55.793
Do you promise?

01:12:57.128 --> 01:12:58.495
I promise.

01:12:59.597 --> 01:13:00.765
Now...

01:13:00.798 --> 01:13:01.933
...let's get you
changed, get your things,

01:13:01.966 --> 01:13:03.200
pretend you're leaving...

01:13:03.234 --> 01:13:05.036
...and I'll see you tonight.

01:15:56.907 --> 01:15:58.876
Put it on!

01:15:58.909 --> 01:15:59.910
No, Mother.

01:16:00.244 --> 01:16:01.812
Do it!

01:16:02.113 --> 01:16:04.882
You can't make
me, I won't do this anymore.

01:16:04.915 --> 01:16:07.017
You know how this goes.

01:16:07.785 --> 01:16:12.656
You're a fool.
Why are you packing?

01:16:12.857 --> 01:16:14.191
I'm going back to school-

01:16:14.225 --> 01:16:17.628
Liar! Schools out.

01:16:18.095 --> 01:16:21.065
Do not stand
there and lie to me!

01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:25.436
Morgan's going to
Paris and I'm going with her.

01:16:25.469 --> 01:16:29.974
You're
leaving me to be with her?

01:16:32.042 --> 01:16:34.011
You disgust me.

01:16:34.245 --> 01:16:36.447
You're a child!

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.349
Did you think I wouldn't know
what you were planning to do

01:16:38.382 --> 01:16:41.218
with that little whore?

01:16:41.252 --> 01:16:43.187
Why didn't you
tell me about her?

01:16:44.488 --> 01:16:46.090
Are you ashamed of me?

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.364
I asked you a question!
Are you ashamed of me?!

01:16:57.334 --> 01:17:01.005
I sent you to college
to get an education.

01:17:01.573 --> 01:17:04.742
You promised me
you'd be a good boy.

01:17:06.243 --> 01:17:08.979
But you weren't a
good boy, were you?

01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:14.752
No. No, you were bad.

01:17:15.819 --> 01:17:18.989
How you found a girl to have sex
with you, I'll never know.

01:17:21.258 --> 01:17:22.459
Did she touch it?

01:17:23.994 --> 01:17:26.463
How'd you convince her to
touch that ugly thing?

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.203
You hurt me.

01:17:32.536 --> 01:17:34.872
You know that?

01:17:35.139 --> 01:17:37.908
You hurt me by
not telling me about her.

01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:42.146
You hurt me by
having sex with her.

01:17:42.179 --> 01:17:44.481
Why did you do that to me?

01:17:45.416 --> 01:17:47.985
Don't you love me?

01:17:56.493 --> 01:18:01.165
Shhh.

01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:04.268
Shhh. Shhh.

01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:09.306
It's okay.

01:18:10.341 --> 01:18:13.310
It's okay.

01:18:15.813 --> 01:18:19.216
You make me so angry sometimes.

01:18:22.553 --> 01:18:26.423
You don't want
momma to be angry, do you?

01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:29.026
No.

01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:33.797
No, you want mommy to feel good.

01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:49.780
Do you wanna make
mommy feel good?

01:18:57.554 --> 01:18:59.223
Do you see my breasts?

01:19:01.292 --> 01:19:03.927
Hm? Do you see my nipples?

01:19:06.397 --> 01:19:08.165
You can kiss them.

01:19:09.466 --> 01:19:11.468
Do you want to kiss my nipples?

01:19:17.508 --> 01:19:20.044
You can be my special boy.

01:19:21.945 --> 01:19:24.915
I'll let you put it in me.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:27.585
Stop!

01:19:29.086 --> 01:19:30.354
Stop!

01:19:30.387 --> 01:19:31.422
Stop it!

01:19:32.156 --> 01:19:33.390
Stop it!

01:19:35.392 --> 01:19:38.195
Stop it! You disgusting bitch!

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:40.598
Roderick, come on,
we're leaving.

01:19:40.632 --> 01:19:42.066
Come get your stuff.

01:19:42.099 --> 01:19:43.133
Come on.

01:19:43.167 --> 01:19:44.268
He's not going anywhere.

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:45.402
He's coming with me.

01:19:45.704 --> 01:19:49.039
He belongs here,
in this house, with me.

01:19:49.073 --> 01:19:51.643
It's his legacy.

01:19:51.676 --> 01:19:54.478
Tell her.

01:19:54.511 --> 01:19:58.349
I.

01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:00.652
I belong here.

01:20:00.685 --> 01:20:02.086
With Mother.

01:20:02.353 --> 01:20:04.121
No, you don't!

01:20:04.154 --> 01:20:05.956
She's sick!

01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:07.858
She's sick!

01:20:08.092 --> 01:20:10.894
She's touched,
you said so yourself.

01:20:11.563 --> 01:20:14.164
Please just come finish packing
with me and then we'll leave,

01:20:14.198 --> 01:20:16.033
together.

01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:19.236
I can't leave, she needs me.

01:20:21.405 --> 01:20:23.575
Well at least go to your
sister's place.

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.175
Sister?

01:20:25.909 --> 01:20:29.614
Mister Usher said he wanted to
see his daughter, Madeline.

01:20:36.954 --> 01:20:39.056
I'm Madeline.

01:20:39.089 --> 01:20:41.291
I'm Mister Usher's daughter.

01:20:42.493 --> 01:20:46.631
You're his wife.

01:20:46.664 --> 01:20:51.669
In a manner of speaking, yes.
I'm his daughter and his wife.

01:20:53.571 --> 01:20:56.106
No.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.341
Roderick...

01:20:59.176 --> 01:21:00.177
...tell her.

01:21:01.311 --> 01:21:03.581
Tell her your
dirty little secret.

01:21:04.348 --> 01:21:08.018
Tell her why you
can never be with her.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.522
Miss Segal...

01:21:12.055 --> 01:21:14.626
...I would like you
to meet my older sister...

01:21:14.659 --> 01:21:16.594
Madeline Usher.

01:21:18.262 --> 01:21:21.398
- No...
- I would like you to meet my mother...

01:21:21.866 --> 01:21:24.234
...the Lady Usher.

01:21:28.673 --> 01:21:30.207
It's a mad house.

01:21:32.376 --> 01:21:34.178
I couldn't find her sir.

01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:35.680
You're all insane!

01:21:35.713 --> 01:21:36.714
Vincent...

01:21:36.748 --> 01:21:41.285
...perhaps you could show
Miss Segal the door.

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:45.522
Miss.

01:21:45.557 --> 01:21:47.324
Is this true?

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.327
I'm afraid so.

01:21:50.762 --> 01:21:52.062
You're all sick.

01:21:54.097 --> 01:21:56.568
It's been this way for
generations Miss.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:00.270
It's the House of Usher.

01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:17.221
Mmmorgan.

01:22:20.725 --> 01:22:22.292
Gordon.

01:22:22.326 --> 01:22:24.127
You scared me.

01:22:24.161 --> 01:22:29.166
Pretty f-f-face...

01:22:31.335 --> 01:22:32.336
Thank you.

01:23:09.473 --> 01:23:11.508
What are you doing in here?

01:23:14.344 --> 01:23:16.380
Get out.

01:23:19.483 --> 01:23:22.687
What do you want?

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:28.292
He's with me.

01:23:34.197 --> 01:23:38.335
I guess I'm more
than just a pretty face.

01:23:38.736 --> 01:23:41.639
Welcome to my house bitch!

01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:55.753
Oh, it was just a dream.

01:23:59.256 --> 01:24:00.457
No!

01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:01.458
No!

01:24:01.491 --> 01:24:03.895
Nooooooo!

01:24:03.928 --> 01:24:06.530
Noooooooo!

01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:09.801
Noooooooo!

01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:13.337
Roderick!

01:24:14.572 --> 01:24:17.107
Let me out!

01:24:17.507 --> 01:24:21.445
Noooooooo!

01:24:22.614 --> 01:24:24.414
It's been like,
what seven months?

01:24:24.448 --> 01:24:26.483
You honestly love
it there that much?

01:24:26.516 --> 01:24:27.719
I honestly do.

01:24:28.653 --> 01:24:30.320
I didn't think I would.

01:24:30.554 --> 01:24:31.656
But you know...?

01:24:31.689 --> 01:24:34.257
I've got to say, as long as
you know the language...

01:24:34.291 --> 01:24:36.460
...it's great here.

01:24:36.493 --> 01:24:38.428
Well maybe I'll just have to
come out and join you next

01:24:38.462 --> 01:24:40.230
semester.

01:24:40.263 --> 01:24:41.699
You totally should.

01:24:42.399 --> 01:24:44.669
I could show you all the sights.

01:24:44.702 --> 01:24:45.903
And the clubs?

01:24:46.104 --> 01:24:48.472
Oh, for sure... the clubs.

01:24:49.206 --> 01:24:52.677
Though I did get kinda burned
out after the first few months I

01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:53.611
was here.

01:24:53.645 --> 01:24:55.713
Well, you are
there to study, after all.

01:24:56.513 --> 01:24:57.782
Yeah.

01:24:58.315 --> 01:24:59.549
But...

01:24:59.584 --> 01:25:02.787
...it's been good to get away
and have a change of scenery.

01:25:03.788 --> 01:25:04.922
Yeah, I feel ya.

01:25:06.691 --> 01:25:08.626
Have you heard
from the mama's boy at all?

01:25:09.627 --> 01:25:10.628
No.

01:25:11.495 --> 01:25:12.864
That is...

01:25:12.897 --> 01:25:14.264
...done.

01:25:14.297 --> 01:25:15.967
Definitely done.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.369
You were right, it was a...
college crush.

01:25:19.604 --> 01:25:22.640
Well it's his loss. Fuck'm.

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:27.612
So when do you think
you'll be coming home?

01:25:27.945 --> 01:25:31.616
I honestly don't know if
I'll ever go back to the states.

01:25:33.283 --> 01:25:34.652
I think I might just live here.

01:25:34.686 --> 01:25:36.688
Like, in Paris?

01:25:37.021 --> 01:25:39.857
I love, love, love it here.

01:25:40.892 --> 01:25:43.561
I mean it's the city of lights
for Christ's sake.

01:25:45.395 --> 01:25:49.533
The history, the art,
the Louvre,

01:25:50.434 --> 01:25:52.302
...the architecture.

01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:55.205
Everything is just so...

01:25:55.973 --> 01:25:57.875
...so beautiful.

01:25:59.944 --> 01:26:03.748
And the food. God, I fucking
love the pastries.

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:08.452
And who knows...

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.655
...maybe I'll meet a guy...

01:26:10.988 --> 01:26:12.389
...fall in love...

01:26:14.692 --> 01:26:16.293
...start a family.

01:26:21.632 --> 01:26:24.434
