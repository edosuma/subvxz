Your first day as a

09:10.884 --> 09:12.151

09:12.186 --> 09:13.552
Doctors at the end of their shifts

09:13.587 --> 09:15.154

09:15.189 --> 09:16.789
You write down every
single word since you know

09:16.824 --> 09:18.472
absolutely nothing about these cases.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.475
You'll be covering 20 patients solo.

09:20.511 --> 09:22.027
- No backup.
- Poor bastard.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.329
What do you mean, "no backup"?

09:23.364 --> 09:24.388
You'll have Nic.

Page me if there's a serious
problem, but remember,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.967

- Slow down, slow down.
- And then from ten minutes later,

10:18.552 --> 10:20.419

That's Nurse Raymond.

He's a total dick.

There's good news and bad news.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.615
You had a very serious heart attack,

11:23.650 --> 11:25.684
and the only reason
you're still with us at all

11:25.719 --> 11:27.786

- That <i>is</i> the good news.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.548
The bad news is, your

The ejection fraction
is severely reduced.

11:38.146 --> 11:40.632
is... you're gonna need a transplant.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.900
Oh, good Lord.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.802
We'll contact UNOS immediately.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.537
You'll be status 1A.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.873
So that'll put you at the
top of the organ donor list.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.915
You'll be top priority for a new heart.

11:49.951 --> 11:51.663
Well, how long is it
gonna take to find one?

11:51.699 --> 11:52.858
Well, unfortunately,

11:52.894 --> 11:55.110
finding the right match can
take weeks, sometimes months.

11:55.146 --> 11:57.871
Well, maybe.

11:59.014 --> 12:00.819
We do have a new heart at
Chastain. It just flew in.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.588
- That organ is already allocated.
- Well, let's

12:02.623 --> 12:04.478
just wait, see if it's a match.

12:04.872 --> 12:07.275
And if it is, we will un-allocate it.

- Yeah? Okay.

- Sorry, Micah. I need Dr. Hawkins

12:34.346 --> 12:36.072

- Okay.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.963
Is everything all right?

12:45.663 --> 12:48.425
- Micah's surgery was canceled.
- Why?

12:48.460 --> 12:50.894
His heart was reallocated
to Congressman Dunlap.

12:51.428 --> 12:53.229
They can't do that.

12:53.265 --> 12:55.966
Yes, they can. The hospital
went through proper channels.

12:56.001 --> 12:58.268
- They got the okay from UNOS.
- You mean they pulled strings.

12:58.303 --> 13:00.191
Look, I'm pissed, too, but
they didn't break any rules.

13:00.227 --> 13:03.206
Dunlap has higher priority
than Micah because he's sicker.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.037
There's nothing you can do.

13:05.462 --> 13:07.027
Says who?

13:12.550 --> 13:15.902
I called Dunlap's wife.
Turns out they're separated.

13:16.324 --> 13:18.288
The daughter's coming.
Flying in from California.

charge of Micah's care.

13:42.514 --> 13:43.813
Don't I know it.

13:43.848 --> 13:45.583
Go easy on him.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.086
Dr. Hawkins, I know you're
upset. I would be, too.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.088
This is against all
protocol, and you know it.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.990
Micah's waited two years for a heart.

13:54.025 --> 13:56.092
You can't just cut in line
for a VIP who hasn't waited

13:56.127 --> 13:57.894
- two minutes.
- Well, they-they both need a heart.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.863
There was only one. It
was a tough decision.

13:59.898 --> 14:02.265
My patient is 28, with his
whole life ahead of him.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.205
That heart could give him 50 more years.

14:04.241 --> 14:06.826
Trip Dunlap is 63 and a smoker.

14:06.862 --> 14:09.460
His body's far more
likely to reject the heart.

14:09.496 --> 14:11.441
And even if the transplant
takes, what does it buy him,

14:11.476 --> 14:13.752
- ten more years?
- Look, Dunlap is critical. I mean,

14:13.788 --> 14:16.523
he could die tonight. And
Micah, he's waited this long.

14:16.559 --> 14:19.625
- He can safely wait a bit longer.
- His quality of life is zero.

14:19.661 --> 14:21.718
He was an athlete.
He's a science teacher.

14:21.753 --> 14:23.887
Loved by his students.
I know him. We all do,

14:24.109 --> 14:26.076
because he's been in
and out of here so often.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.940
Three times we thought we had a heart.

14:27.976 --> 14:29.576
Three times he was sent home.

14:29.612 --> 14:31.835
Zero complaining or self-pity, ever.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.209
This guy, he's golden.

14:33.245 --> 14:35.632
You want to tell Dunlap's daughter
her father is less deserving?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.801
Why? Because he's a VIP
who can help out Chastain.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.237
You really speak your mind.
It's just, it's a juvenile habit.

14:41.272 --> 14:43.873
The decision was made
for medical reasons alone.

14:43.908 --> 14:46.010
I think we both know
that's not the truth.

14:46.046 --> 14:48.745
I'm gonna cut you some slack
because you're upset.

14:49.249 --> 14:50.685

14:53.318 --> 14:54.985

Your EKG looks normal,

15:00.125 --> 15:03.262
- and you should be out of here tomorrow.
- Thank you.

15:04.718 --> 15:07.430
(QUIETLY): You forgot to
listen to his heart, Doctor.

15:08.105 --> 15:10.642
I don't need to listen to his
heart. I looked at his EKG.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.742
Why didn't the murmur
show up on his EKG?

15:18.777 --> 15:20.243
Occasionally, you can
get a normal reading

15:20.278 --> 15:22.011
in patients with

15:22.046 --> 15:23.346
Always use your stethoscope.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.327
If you don't, Conrad will ream you.

15:25.363 --> 15:27.517
- Do you have to tell him?
- No, because I know you're never

15:27.552 --> 15:30.120
gonna skip listening to
a patient's heart again.

15:30.155 --> 15:32.555
Devon, I want you to call
the OPO every 15 minutes.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.758

41:53.400 --> 41:54.733
and been home in a few days,

41:54.768 --> 41:56.936
but now he's gonna be in the
hospital for at least a week

41:56.971 --> 41:59.805
- enduring a hellishly painful recovery.
- Wrong.

42:00.197 --> 42:02.574
You didn't check Mitch's records. I did.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.201
And it turns out he has a
hereditary platelet dysfunction,

42:05.237 --> 42:08.073
which means a femoral cath
would have caused him massive bleeding,

42:08.109 --> 42:09.676
and he would have died.

42:09.712 --> 42:11.245
So I made a fast call,

42:11.483 --> 42:12.964
and it was the right call,

42:13.000 --> 42:14.753
that may have saved his life.

42:15.083 --> 42:16.589
- And you know how I know that?
- Hmm?

42:16.624 --> 42:18.224
He's doing great in recovery right now.

42:18.259 --> 42:19.658
Look at this guy. He
forgot rule number one.

42:19.693 --> 42:21.495
DEVON: I didn't forget it.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.361
I broke it.

42:24.315 --> 42:26.065
And I will again.

42:26.727 --> 42:28.573
Because you are not always right.

42:28.842 --> 42:30.275
No one is.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.472
That's why this job is so difficult.

42:33.507 --> 42:36.242
And when you're wrong, I will
be the first one to tell you.

42:37.061 --> 42:38.774
And if you don't like that...

42:39.980 --> 42:41.614
cut me.

42:42.487 --> 42:44.311
Right now, right here.

42:45.043 --> 42:47.435
I don't care. End my career.

42:47.721 --> 42:51.325
Because I am not your slave,
your shadow, or your echo.

42:53.961 --> 42:55.462
Devon!

43:03.398 --> 43:06.686
Congratulations, you just
passed Independence Day.
