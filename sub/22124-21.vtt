you're not dealing with
something? Chloe and Pierce?

00:05.440 --> 00:07.137
Perhaps you're not

Why?!

00:37.863 --> 00:39.996
I couldn't...
hurt her like that.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.601
I think the reason
that your mark is gone

is glaringly obvious,

02:47.993 --> 02:49.256
isn't it?

02:49.299 --> 02:50.779
The moment you chose
to pull the ripcord

02:51.997 --> 02:53.956

02:53.999 --> 02:55.958
By giving you exactly
what you wanted.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.629
to that intolerable knob,
Pierce.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.630
Even if he has
lost his mark.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.197
Pierce lost his what now?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.416
Allow me to catch you up.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.899
So, the lieutenant has
a ridiculous theory

09:55.943 --> 09:57.858
that, shockingly,
may hold water.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.686
He believes that
the detective's affections

09:59.729 --> 10:00.861
are what make me vulnerable.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.863
And now that
she cares for him--

10:02.906 --> 10:05.213
well, long story short, old ham
hands isn't cursed anymore.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.257
He's mortal.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.043
So,

10:09.086 --> 10:10.871
your vulnerability is proof

10:10.914 --> 10:12.568
that Chloe cared for you...

10:12.612 --> 10:14.657
but now she
cares for Pierce,

10:14.701 --> 10:16.877
so now he'svulnerable, too.Close.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.530
She cares for Pierce and me.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.577
As proven by my bleeding.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.972
Yet, for some
inexplicable reason,

10:25.015 --> 10:27.409
she's on the fence
between the two of us.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.540
And how does that make you feel?

10:28.584 --> 10:31.674
Well, it makes me feel...

10:31.718 --> 10:32.936
like I...

10:35.635 --> 10:38.246
...like I need
to tip the scales in my favor.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.682
Show her

10:39.726 --> 10:41.553
which side
the grass is greener on.

10:41.597 --> 10:44.382
And why do you want
to tip Chloe to your side?

10:44.426 --> 10:45.906
Because, as her partner,

10:45.949 --> 10:48.735
it's my duty to save her
from making a terrible mistake.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.040
Uh-huh.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.302
Pierce has clearly blinded her

10:51.346 --> 10:52.652
with his charming oaf routine.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.131
So I need to open her eyes.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.569
Show her that I'm better
than him in every possible way.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.702
And what if
Chloe does choose you?

10:59.746 --> 11:02.792
Well, then, things can finally
go back to the way they were,

11:02.836 --> 11:06.448
before Pierce, obviously.
[laughs]

11:06.491 --> 11:09.756
Uh...[door opens, closes]

11:09.799 --> 11:12.454
Why do I feel like I should've
stopped him this time?

11:12.497 --> 11:13.716
MAZE:
What the hell is this?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.284
PIERCE: It's pretty
self-explanatory.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.112
The plan is off.
Why?

11:18.155 --> 11:20.636
We were so close to getting
happily-sexed Decker

11:20.680 --> 11:22.072
to fall for you.

11:22.116 --> 11:25.380
Yeah, and I messed it up, okay?
I broke up with her.

11:25.423 --> 11:28.078
You broke up with her?

11:29.427 --> 11:30.820
What happened to getting rid
of your mark?

11:30.864 --> 11:32.300
Doesn't matter.

11:32.343 --> 11:35.042
I'm done with grand plans
and manipulations.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.827
I don't want
to use Chloe anymore.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.655
What about
what I want?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.744
Because if we don't
get Chloe to love you,

11:41.788 --> 11:43.311
then we can't
lift your curse.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.748
And if we can't
lift your curse,

11:45.792 --> 11:48.577
then I can't kill you
and hang it on Lucifer.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.666
Framing Lucifer
for murder

11:50.710 --> 11:52.973
is the only way to blow up
his life on Earth.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.322
Keep your voice down.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.715
What don't you get?

11:55.758 --> 11:57.281
My side of the plan
doesn't work without yours.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.935
And I need this

11:58.979 --> 12:00.632
to get back to Hell.

12:00.676 --> 12:04.288
I'm sorry.
Like I said, the plan's off.

12:10.381 --> 12:13.428
Says you.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.301
Detective.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.694
Pardon my tardiness,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.522
but I come bearing gifts.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.350
What is this?

12:22.393 --> 12:24.700
Well, I know how you like
your seasonal beverages,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.789
so I got you a
"Luck o' the Irish" Latte

12:26.833 --> 12:28.965
and-- oh!
To be sure, to be sure,

12:29.009 --> 12:30.097
little something extra.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.190
Oh, y-you got me a lemon bar.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.931
Mm, well, they're your
favorites, aren't they?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.671
Mm...Look, Detective,

12:39.715 --> 12:42.196
I know that you're going through
a difficult time right now,

12:42.239 --> 12:43.371
and what you need

12:43.414 --> 12:44.459
is someone who knows you.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.200
I know. It's just...

12:46.243 --> 12:48.028
Um...
It's just what?

12:48.071 --> 12:50.160
Ooh, lemon bars.
My favorite. Mmm.

12:50.204 --> 12:53.033
Oh, man, these are amazing.
Who made 'em?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.730
Uh, Pierce did.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.732
Would you believe
that hunk bakes?

12:56.776 --> 13:00.214
On second thought,
who needs the empty calories?

13:00.257 --> 13:01.215
Hmm.

13:01.258 --> 13:04.522
Hmm, looks like someone

13:04.566 --> 13:06.568
is trying to crawl their way
out of the doghouse.

13:06.611 --> 13:07.438
Mm-hmm

13:07.482 --> 13:09.049
Is it working?Yes, is it?

13:09.092 --> 13:10.877
Let's just focus on the case.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.139
Ella, what do you have?

13:12.182 --> 13:13.836
Uh, so I got a lead
off the murder weapon.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.405
No match on the DNA, but I did
find a signature of sorts.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.537
The ballet shoe
had traces

13:19.581 --> 13:22.366
of olive oil,
Evian and beeswax.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.064
So our killer's a bumblebee
with expensive taste?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.239
CHLOE:
Or a ballerina.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.589
Dancers all have
their own unique way

13:27.632 --> 13:29.330
of prepping
their shoes.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.592
And, according
to her social media,

13:30.635 --> 13:31.898
guess who uses
those exact ingredients?

13:31.941 --> 13:33.421
Reina's former
understudy

13:33.464 --> 13:37.686
and L.A. West Ballet's
new prima ballerina,

13:37.729 --> 13:39.688
Amber Fontaine.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.909
So either she took out
her competition

13:42.952 --> 13:44.867
or the killer somehow
got one of her shoes?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.914
No, no, no, definitely looks
like a Black Swan to me.

13:47.957 --> 13:52.440
GWENDOLYN: And bras and up.
Ladies, arms out...

13:52.483 --> 13:54.094
CHLOE:
Sorry to interrupt.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.878
We'd like to speak

13:55.922 --> 13:57.445
with Amber Fontaine.For what?

13:57.488 --> 13:59.273
We're extremely busy here.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.709
Yes, us, too.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.754
Solving the crime of
a brutally murdered ballerina.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.104
But Amber didn't have anything
to do with that.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.584
[scoffs]And we only
got two days

14:06.628 --> 14:09.065
to get this show
up and running.Easy, easy, Gwen.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.545
They're just
doing their jobs.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.242
I'm sorry.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.636
We're just all pretty
emotional right now.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.030
Yes, clearly some
more than others.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.901
CHLOE: We know it
was your shoe

14:18.945 --> 14:20.642
that was used to strangle Reina.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.036
That's crazy.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.081
The killer must've stolen them
out of my locker.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.128
I mean, Reina's locker.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.913
Look, respect for going
full Tonya Harding,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.393
but if you're
gonna kill someone,

14:32.436 --> 14:33.916
you should get your story
straight first.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.789
No, Reina's locker was mine
for, like, a week

14:37.833 --> 14:40.662
when she left the company
for her new gig.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.664
But when she came back,
I had to return it.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.492
I-I must've left
my pointe shoes in there.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.797
Where were you
last night?

14:45.841 --> 14:47.103
Home.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.105
Sleeping like a baby.
You can ask my roommate.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.673
Now that Reina's dead,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.066
I'm back to being tied in knots.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.806
Yes, murder can do that.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.678
No, as much as I
thought that I wanted

14:56.721 --> 15:01.161
her spot, to be able to dance
with a legend like Miguel,

15:01.204 --> 15:03.337
I-I wasn't ready.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.339
I was happy to keep
learning from Reina.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.995
I thought it was
our gain and their loss.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.692
Whose loss exactly?

15:10.735 --> 15:12.824
You know, America's Next
Prima Ballerina.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.828
The TV show Reina
was gonna host.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.921
You know, I'm inclined
to believe our young ingenue.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.792
If there's nothing she and
Reina were competing for,

15:23.835 --> 15:25.881
it makes her motive
far less compelling.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.752
Yeah, we need to look
into this TV show,

15:27.796 --> 15:29.189
see why she
turned it down.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.278
Well, it certainly wouldn't
be art over commerce.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.889
No one has that
kind of passion...

15:36.413 --> 15:38.372
Are those from...

15:38.415 --> 15:41.157
Marcus. Yeah.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.072
Bastard. [elevator bell dings]

15:45.248 --> 15:47.816
Luci, what is so urgent?
Why'd you call me here?

15:47.859 --> 15:49.905
Because enough is enough.
It's time.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.039
We need to get rid of Pierce.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.046
What exactly do you mean by

16:00.089 --> 16:01.047
"get rid of Pierce"?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.049
Well, what do you think I mean?

16:03.092 --> 16:05.007
Yeah, we're not gonna
kill him, Luci.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.575
I know, angels
can't kill humans,

16:07.618 --> 16:08.924
yadda yadda yadda.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.708
Spare me the lecture.
Besides, killing Pierce

16:10.752 --> 16:12.406
isn't the answer anyway

16:12.449 --> 16:14.147
because, inexplicable
as it is,

16:14.190 --> 16:15.887
the detective actually
cares for the man,

16:15.931 --> 16:17.411
and breaking her heart
isn't the goal.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.109
I got to admit, I'm a little
fuzzy on that one myself.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.502
What is the goal?

16:21.545 --> 16:24.374
For the detective to realize
she needs to pick me

16:24.418 --> 16:27.290
over that blithering clod,
Pierce, which...

16:27.334 --> 16:28.944
gah, shouldn't even
be an issue, but...

16:28.988 --> 16:32.078
I'm in.
You are?

16:32.121 --> 16:35.690
You are my brother and my test.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.344
Whatever needs to be done.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.737
Well, I have to admit,

16:39.781 --> 16:42.305
I didn't expect that
to be quite so easy,

16:42.349 --> 16:44.655
but I'm not one to look
a gift-angel in the mouth,

16:44.699 --> 16:45.787
I'll take it.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.615
So what's the plan?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.225
We need to make
the detective realize

16:49.269 --> 16:51.097
that Pierce isn't the man
she thinks he is.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.708
We need to prove to her

16:53.751 --> 16:56.754
that he is a two-faced,
loathsome biblical liar.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.801
I mean, how hard can that be?

16:59.844 --> 17:03.065
He is the man behind the whole
Sinnerman thing, after all.

17:03.109 --> 17:06.982
Um... what?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.463
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't I tell you?

17:09.506 --> 17:12.988
Fun fact: Pierce equals
criminal mastermind.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.772
Anyway...

17:14.816 --> 17:17.819
You run with that, and I'll
keep working on the detective.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.300
GRIZZLED MAN:
Read my lips:

17:20.343 --> 17:23.085
Dance is pain.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.653
You want to feel sorry
for yourselves?

17:25.696 --> 17:28.177
Then go back to Kansas
or wherever you're from.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.310
ELLA:
That is Myles Druker.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.791
Only one of the most amazing
choreographers in the world.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.358
Choreographer
with a bum leg?

17:35.402 --> 17:38.013
Is this one of those, "those
who can't, teach" scenarios?

17:38.057 --> 17:41.408
He was a dancer who lost his leg
in a car crash.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.713
Oh.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.585
But he never believed
in playing the victim.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.021
Instead,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.632
he turned his tragedy
into an inspirational story

17:48.676 --> 17:50.112
for all of us to follow.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.985
He's also the creator of America's Next Prima Ballerina,

17:54.029 --> 17:55.552
the show that Reina
was gonna host,

17:55.596 --> 17:57.859
until she reneged on her deal
and it cost him a fortune.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.252
Right. Well, I don't see why

17:59.295 --> 18:00.862
he wouldn't take
such a loss in stride.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.821
[laughs] You see
what I did there?Mm-hmm.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.649
In stride?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.173
You must be aware
that Reina Markova

18:07.216 --> 18:08.478
was killed last night.

18:08.522 --> 18:12.700
Yeah, I heard. Big whoop.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.268
[chuckles] Well, for a potential
cold-blooded killer,

18:15.311 --> 18:17.183
you're being quite... obvious.

18:17.226 --> 18:20.142
I mean, I just don't think Reina
was much of a professional.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.317
Then why'd you hire her?

18:21.361 --> 18:23.972
Let's just say I was...
pressured

18:24.015 --> 18:25.278
into our collaboration.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.628
By whom?

18:27.671 --> 18:30.805
By none of your business.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.459
Look, I'm a very busy man,

18:32.502 --> 18:34.635
so unless you're gonna charge me
with anything, we're done here.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.810
LUCIFER:
Well, actually, no.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.986
I just have
one more question.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.292
Uh, take note,
Detective.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.945

40:04.489 --> 40:06.273
No.

40:06.316 --> 40:10.364
But I did try everything to get
that lovesick, former immortal

40:10.408 --> 40:13.019
out of the picture when
really all I should've done

40:13.062 --> 40:15.978
was told the detective
how I felt...

40:21.593 --> 40:23.072
...how I really feel.

40:25.074 --> 40:28.121
Then why don't you?

40:28.164 --> 40:30.863
I can't.

40:30.906 --> 40:33.605
What are you so afraid of?

40:35.084 --> 40:36.477
At first it was
your devil face.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.392
What now?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.829
You don't want Chloe to
see that you have wings?

40:40.873 --> 40:43.049
[stammers, chuckles]
Who cares?

40:43.092 --> 40:45.530
I do! I care!Why?!

40:45.573 --> 40:47.706
Because she doesn't have
a choice, does she?

40:47.749 --> 40:49.403
Neither do I!

40:49.447 --> 40:52.406
It's all part of His master plan
to toy with us,

40:52.450 --> 40:54.713
to make us dance
for His bloody amusement.

40:54.756 --> 40:55.714
That's an excuse.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.542
Don't you see?

40:57.585 --> 41:00.501
You're doing the same
thing as Him now.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.373
By not telling
Chloe the truth,

41:03.417 --> 41:06.376
you're taking her choice away.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.377
No.

41:07.421 --> 41:08.901
[laughing]: No.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.206
No, it's different.

41:10.250 --> 41:13.253
You know, the truth is...

41:13.296 --> 41:16.343
no one really knows what
your dad's responsible for.

41:16.386 --> 41:19.738
We're all just guessing.

41:19.781 --> 41:22.349
Even you.

41:22.392 --> 41:24.569
But you know the one thing
He can't control?

41:26.440 --> 41:30.705
What you do in this moment
right now.

41:30.749 --> 41:32.751
So I ask you,

41:32.794 --> 41:36.537
the Devil...

41:36.581 --> 41:40.889
what do you truly desire?

41:44.589 --> 41:47.243
I want her to choose me.

41:47.287 --> 41:49.768
Then tell her.

41:49.811 --> 41:52.510
[exhales] Yes.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.993
Yes.

42:01.606 --> 42:04.565
♪ Cross my heart
and hope to die... ♪

42:04.609 --> 42:05.958
[knock at door]

42:06.001 --> 42:09.135
♪ I promise not

42:09.178 --> 42:10.266
♪ To tell a lie...

42:10.310 --> 42:11.703
I'm sorry for
just stopping by,

42:11.746 --> 42:13.052
but when you didn't
make dinner...

42:13.095 --> 42:16.577
No, I, i-it's... I'm sorry.

42:16.621 --> 42:19.798
This case has,
you know, been...

42:19.841 --> 42:21.974
It's okay.

42:22.017 --> 42:25.107
I can say what I need
to say here... now.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.937
[quietly]:
Okay.

42:28.981 --> 42:32.506
For days I've been thinking
about how I screwed up.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.813
Tried to figure out how
to make things better.

42:34.856 --> 42:38.991
When you find that person
who gives life meaning,

42:39.034 --> 42:41.123
Chloe, nothing else matters.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.777
Okay, well...

42:42.821 --> 42:44.518
I know you don't trust me.
I know I've made mistakes.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.869
I've made an eternity's worth
of mistakes.

42:47.913 --> 42:49.784
But please, let me spend
the rest of my days

42:49.828 --> 42:50.829
making it up to you.

42:50.872 --> 42:53.396
What? What are you doing?

42:57.618 --> 43:00.578
Chloe Decker,
will you marry me?

43:07.106 --> 43:08.934
