- ( giggles )

00:37.671 --> 00:39.173
( whistles )

00:40.608 --> 00:42.210
Come here.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.412
I owe my friend
over there a prank.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.547
Do me a favor.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.849
Have a go
at his pocket for me.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.218
Go on.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.520
**

01:03.864 --> 01:06.234
Hey, thief!
Come back!

01:06.267 --> 01:08.502
Stop, thief!

01:08.536 --> 01:11.105
( people screaming )

01:13.807 --> 01:16.244
I'm sorry!

01:16.277 --> 01:19.313
I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.450
( groans )

01:24.352 --> 01:25.353
( pistol cocks )

01:37.331 --> 01:38.832
( sighs )

01:38.866 --> 01:41.602
- ( clock ticking )
- ( knuckles crack )

01:41.635 --> 01:44.372
How do you know my shot
won't kill him?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.774
Hewlett:
How do you know
his men won't shoot?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.111
So sorry.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.382
( sighs )

01:56.650 --> 01:58.452
What about poison?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.856
( all laughing )

02:02.890 --> 02:04.625
General Clinton
will be a moment longer

02:04.658 --> 02:06.660
but asks that you please
begin without him.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.363
- I'll take a whisky.
- Whisky.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.899
- Sherry.
- How long has it
been opened?

02:11.932 --> 02:14.235
Uh, let me sniff it.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.404
( men chattering )

02:17.671 --> 02:20.574
Swirling the bruised
grape elements,

02:20.608 --> 02:24.312
it allows
for full aeration.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.789
"With rage and shaking
he swallows the ground

02:35.823 --> 02:37.425
at the sound
of the trumpet."

02:37.458 --> 02:39.760
To the warhorse
and to war!

02:39.793 --> 02:41.595
- ( glasses clink )
- Men: Hear, hear.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.273
- Oh...
- What is it?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.174
- Help him, help him!
- For God's sake, help the man!

02:55.876 --> 02:58.612
- Benedict:
Loosen his necktie!
- ( gasping )

03:01.749 --> 03:04.618
( no audible dialogue )

03:08.822 --> 03:10.424
( pistol cocks )

03:14.995 --> 03:16.997
I wouldn't leave powder
on the glass.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.432
And Simcoe
wouldn't drink first.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.401
Perhaps not,
but your scenario is--

03:20.434 --> 03:21.802
they wouldn't execute me
on the spot.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.704
No, no, you'd get
the whole firing line

03:23.737 --> 03:25.739
after they traced
the poison back to you.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.841
( distant marching )

03:29.543 --> 03:31.979
( ticking )

03:32.012 --> 03:34.582
We'd better pick
this up tomorrow.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.217
Should we survive
to see it.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.790
**

03:44.292 --> 03:46.894
Well, can't stay
in there forever.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.863
- Abe: Ready with
the chamber pot?
- Right away.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.000
Psst, back up.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.936
Let these fools pass.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.841
**

04:19.892 --> 04:21.829
Up before reveille?

04:21.862 --> 04:24.365
Early bird
gets the worm.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.033
Must be some bird.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.737
( theme music playing )

04:29.770 --> 04:32.940
* Hush, hush

04:32.973 --> 04:35.075
* There's snakes
in the garden *

04:35.108 --> 04:38.879
* Soul for sale

04:38.912 --> 04:41.715
* Blood on the vines

04:41.749 --> 04:44.051
* Hush, hush

04:44.084 --> 04:46.520
* I know there will
come a day *

04:46.554 --> 04:50.958
* They're hiding
in the color of night *

04:50.991 --> 04:53.994
- * I can't wait anymore
- * Soul for sale

04:56.464 --> 04:59.867
- * I can't wait anymore
- * Soul for sale

05:01.769 --> 05:04.905
* I can't wait anymore

05:12.480 --> 05:12.880
( chatter )

05:13.914 --> 05:16.417
Ann:
Be comfortable
in your lies

05:16.450 --> 05:18.051
and hold to your story.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.921
That's all you need remember
if they question you.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.090
Why would
they question me?

05:23.123 --> 05:26.994
I knew you were
hiding a secret the second
you stepped foot in camp.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.397
Lucky for you,

05:29.430 --> 05:32.666
no one pays much mind
to women around here.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.669
Army lists
us camp followers
as baggage.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.971
Washington doesn't
want to see us,

05:38.005 --> 05:39.440
but we can see him.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.609
You want me to spy
on General Washington?

05:41.642 --> 05:44.812
( whispers )
Shh. Don't be ridiculous.

05:44.845 --> 05:49.049
We're not allowed near him,
but we don't need to be.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.720
We can count his soldiers
and his cannons.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.154
And I know
which shot they use

05:54.187 --> 05:56.457
by feeling the weight
of the ball.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.759
- I don't know how to--
- Doesn't matter.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.128
You know something better.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.932
Anna Strong.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.739
That Major Tallmadge
of hers

06:11.772 --> 06:14.575
is Washington's
head of intelligence.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.011
**

06:21.615 --> 06:22.883
We need to talk.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.952
I know.
I'm glad you came by.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.055
You were right
about being careful in camp.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.961
You've a keen eye,
Mrs. Smith.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.464
I do have one
of better quality
over here.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.602
Not here.
The barn.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.704
After dark.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.778
I can't believe
you're still on shit patrol.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.713
If I was hobnobbing
with the quartermaster--

06:52.746 --> 06:55.115
I asked for this, Sturridge.
It reminds me of the farm.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.819
So does swiving a sow,
but I don't see you doing that.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.121
Maybe that's why
you sneak off to Holy Ground?

07:01.154 --> 07:02.690
( moos )

07:02.723 --> 07:04.992
No, I like to get away
from the barracks.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.160
- Get some fresh air.
- Right.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.962
Well, I'm hoping to pass
this freshness off

07:08.996 --> 07:11.031
to the new man.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.166
New man?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.868
Defector, they say.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.504
Came across yesterday.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.872
The shite rolls downhill,
God willing.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.241
Private Woodhull,

07:21.274 --> 07:24.144
General Arnold requests you
at his house.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.747
Why does everyone
love you?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.885
The general
is right this way.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.593
Mr. Woodhull, thank you
for coming to my home today.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.194
Yes.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.231
As well as to York City
to kidnap my husband.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.900
( clock ticking )

07:54.808 --> 07:57.745
I want to help
in any way I can.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.115
( laughs )

08:02.149 --> 08:03.784
Is this a joke?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.756
- Am I being pranked, here?
- No prank.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.959
She means it,
or my boy would be dead,

08:11.992 --> 08:13.594
and so would you.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.563
Peggy:
In recognition
of my service,

08:15.596 --> 08:17.865
I expect a guarantee
from General Washington.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.967
The Shippen family
will suffer no reprisals

08:20.000 --> 08:22.169
during or after
this war.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.739
Benedict is not
the man I married.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.274
When I took his hand,
he was a general

08:27.307 --> 08:28.942
in the Continental Army.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.879
His treason will not stain
my family or my child.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.717
What are you offering?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.186
I know his schedule.

08:39.219 --> 08:42.923
Cicero told you about
his nightly routine.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.593
Do you plan on
taking him here
at the house?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.961
( sighs )

08:58.639 --> 09:00.941
Peggy, echoing:
Let's pretend to enjoy
the evening, shall we?

09:00.974 --> 09:03.243
Whatever you say, dear.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.212
At the house?

09:05.245 --> 09:07.047
( knock on door )

09:13.621 --> 09:15.088
The general's
right this way.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.592
**

09:34.174 --> 09:35.342
( grunts )

09:40.848 --> 09:43.917
No. The house won't work.

09:43.951 --> 09:47.087
If the general
is taken from here,
they'll investigate,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.656
ask questions
of the household,

09:48.689 --> 09:51.959
who we know
can't keep a secret.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.127
We need to get him
out of the house.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.096
If you get him to the wharf,
we'll be waiting with a boat

09:56.129 --> 09:57.698
and men to take him
across the water.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.366
- When?
- What?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.901
I can arrange
a carriage ride.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.737
Just the two of us.
When will you be ready?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.105
I need to check
with my people.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.207
How long will it take
for you to arrange the ride?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.109
Three days?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.144
- Two?
- One.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.124
He's only the second man
to ever defect

10:25.759 --> 10:27.360
from Light Horse
Harry Lee.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.997
If that regiment is breaking,
then they're all doomed.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.699
Sergeant Champe
tells it best.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.668
Go on, tell the general
what you told me.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.070
As I told General Arnold,

10:37.104 --> 10:39.873
I'm here solely
due to his actions.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.975
They gave me the courage
to cross the lines

10:42.009 --> 10:44.044
and I wanted him to know
that his example

10:44.077 --> 10:47.347
has raised the passions
of my fellow soldiers.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.283
I want Champe to be
my recruiting sergeant,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.419
the face
of the American Legion.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.321
We'll inspire
more brave men

10:54.354 --> 10:56.890
back to their proper place
in history.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.128
Welcome to York City.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.867
Sergeant Champe,
now in service

11:06.900 --> 11:09.069
to his Majesty's
American Legion,

11:09.102 --> 11:10.270
report to the barracks

11:10.303 --> 11:12.039
and get yourself
a proper uniform.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.719
- ( door opens )
- You heard him.

11:25.753 --> 11:29.189
Men are moved
by my sacrifice.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.059
This fools uprising
is being swept away,

11:32.092 --> 11:33.460
and Washington with it.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.862
Send me south.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.830
Men from the countryside
will rally to me

11:36.864 --> 11:39.132
and swell our numbers.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.168
This letter from
Lord Cornwallis

11:41.201 --> 11:44.037
says exactly
the opposite.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.507
- He's in Charles Town?
- He was.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.244
Now he's pursuing
Nathanael Greene
through the Carolinas,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.914
defeating him
at every skirmish,

11:53.947 --> 11:56.149
yet gaining no land
of any importance.

11:56.183 --> 12:00.087
Instead, the rebel numbers
swell after each battle.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.290
Well, there's
one reason for that.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.026
Cornwallis is English.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.861
I'm a colonist

12:07.895 --> 12:10.130
and a hero to them all.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.432
Fight fire with fire.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.069
Sturridge.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.504
Yes?

12:17.537 --> 12:19.907
You've got sentry
every night this week.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.508
And you've got latrine.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.476
Just like you wanted.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.848
Switch with me.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.382
( laughs )

12:29.416 --> 12:33.186
Woodhull, I was born
to stand around and
do nothing.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.423
I ain't trading that
for shite.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.225
Literally.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.028
I'll introduce you
to my girl.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.796
( laughs )
What do you mean,
introduce?

12:42.830 --> 12:44.898
I mean...
( whispering )

12:48.902 --> 12:50.470
The whole week, though,
or nothing.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.240
I'll swap you
the Sabbath.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.241
Thursday.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.009
Sunday.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.213
- ( door opens )
- Man: Take whichever you want.

13:00.247 --> 13:04.117
You outrank these bastards,
so it's your pick.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.120
Grab one of them
to show you around
the right places to recruit.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.324
( whispers )
That's the defector.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.394
Just came over,
and he's already been made
recruiting sergeant.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.163
Bastard.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.031
- Brown nose.
- ( clears throat )

13:22.235 --> 13:24.137
John Champe.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.174
Joe Sturridge.
Welcome to paradise.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.076
Thanks.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.312
I haven't been to the city
since the summer of '73.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.214
I miss that summer.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.283
Joe:
Suppose it was
nicer back then

13:36.316 --> 13:38.385
before the rebels
burned half of it.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.588
I was here in '73.
It was a different place then.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.490
Abraham Woodhull.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.026
If you know the city
better now, maybe you
could show me around.

13:46.059 --> 13:49.429
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll leave
you city lovers to it.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.031
They told me
to approach the man

13:51.064 --> 13:53.500
who looked least
like a soldier.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
Figured it was him.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.569
Over here.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.943
Tallmadge got
your message.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.278
Don't say Tallmadge.
Use his number.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.015
They didn't give me numbers.
Didn't give me your name.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.017
They gave me the plan,
and I'm to follow it.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.485
All right, all right.
You just got here.
Slow down.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.554
Get yourself settled.
Don't act suspicious.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.256
Where's the other man
I'm supposed to meet?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.325
The signal.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.527
He's the anxious type.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.562
I'm not, and you're
making me anxious.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.531
I need to signal camp.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.366
Tonight.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.636
**

14:38.278 --> 14:40.480
You alone?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.182
No.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.321
All right,
what do you have
to tell us?

14:48.355 --> 14:50.357
There's a spy amongst
the camp followers

14:50.390 --> 14:52.225
working for the British.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.961
How do you know?

14:53.994 --> 14:56.196
She revealed
her true intentions
and her true name to me

14:56.229 --> 14:58.298
when she learned
I was hiding mine.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.000
Ben:
Who is she?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.969
What do I get
in return?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.972
( scoffs )
How about you won't
be charged with treason?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.307
Abraham is safe and alive
in York City.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.077
We've just sent a man in
to support him on his mission
and then bring him home.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.245
- Anna--
- Is this man the defector
everyone's been talking about?

15:12.279 --> 15:13.613
- Yes.
- Stop.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.285
Her name is Ann Bates.
You know her as Ann Barnes.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.288
And she knows he runs
intelligence for Washington.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.723
She assumes the two of you
are lovers and that we two
are friendly.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.393
She asks I get
any information
that I can from you.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.497
- Who does she report to?
- I don't know.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.232
Is she working with
anyone else in the camp?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.667
I don't know.
I suggest you
arrest her and ask her.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.404
We will.
Mary, thank you.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.672
You've done
a great thing.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.109
I didn't look for this.
It just happened.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.478
What will happen to her?

15:46.646 --> 15:49.682
- Well--
- Nothing.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.518
I'm not going
to arrest her,
not yet.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.486
- What?
- She's targeting
our network,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.122
but we know nothing
about hers.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.390
If we take her now,
then it might warn
the others.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.693
You have to
report back to her

16:00.727 --> 16:02.462
and find out who else
she's working with.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.999
I have to--
( laughs )

16:06.033 --> 16:08.401
I am not her spy
or your spy.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.271
We don't know how long
she's been in camp
or what she knows.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.240
It's possible that
she or one of her allies

16:13.273 --> 16:15.508
already has something
on Abe and just hasn't
put it together yet.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.077
I think
she's working alone.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.678
Well, if you can
confirm that,

16:18.711 --> 16:20.313
then we'll all breathe
a little easier.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.486
- ( chatter )
- ( hooves clopping )

16:47.840 --> 16:49.509
Woodhull?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.744
I'm here.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.348
I got your note.
Why are we meeting--

16:55.382 --> 16:57.250
He's a friend.
Tallmadge sent him.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.686
- He's here to get Arnold.
- He doesn't know that?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.489
I told you,
if you had just
waited like I asked...

17:02.522 --> 17:04.723
You were supposed to know
that I was coming.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.726
- I wasn't told.
- I was supposed to tell him.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.795
I forgot.
I apologize.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.098
You send the signal,
correct?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.398
Through the "Gazette"?
That's you.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.434
- That's correct.
- I asked him.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.339
Sergeant John Champe,
2nd Partisan Corps.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.278
I wasn't told your name
and I won't ask it.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.679
I'm here to tell you
that your message

17:26.713 --> 17:29.449
was received
and appreciated.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.318
And I need you
to send a new signal.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.519
A special one.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.321
Special how?

17:34.354 --> 17:37.657
Place the number three
in the advertisement.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.492
That will tell them
to be here three nights

17:39.526 --> 17:40.860
from the publish date.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.363
We take the traitor
this Thursday.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.833
What?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.501
Arnold brought me
by his home to show it off,

17:48.535 --> 17:50.170
and I had a look about.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.738
You were right
about the outhouse.
It's perfect.

17:51.771 --> 17:52.839
- Good.
- Hold-- hold on.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.507
The plan is we wait
till midnight,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.609
get into his garden,
and then knock him out.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.178
It's three blocks
to an abandoned dock.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.512
We'll be met with a boat.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.481
Woodhull, I'll need
your help hauling Arnold

18:01.514 --> 18:02.882
on account of my arm.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.883
No.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.186
No, no, no, no, no.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.820
This is Major Tallmadge's plan,
and we are to follow it.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.590
Well, Tallmadge isn't here.
We are.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.259
Thursday's too soon.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.194
What's wrong?

18:16.363 --> 18:17.764
- Is it Hewlett?
- No.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.699
- Who's Hewlett?
- It's not Hewlett.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.168
I paid him off.
It's settled.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.303
He's no trouble.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.405
What is going on here?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.908
He forget to mention things
from time to time.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.678
You know what you need to know,
and you don't know anything.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.913
You just got here.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.649
If you keep
charging ahead like this,
you're gonna get us all killed.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.886
Arnold is the job
that I've come for,

18:39.919 --> 18:42.522
and I will see it done.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.392
You botch that,
I will kill you.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.826
Clear?

18:51.398 --> 18:53.366
Will there be
any issue signaling?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.902
None whatsoever.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.507
Then Thursday it is.

19:08.281 --> 19:12.319
Most men assume
a lady can't understand
warfare complexities,

19:12.352 --> 19:15.422
so they'll speak freely
around you.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.856
I'm lucky I have you
to guide me.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.558
Thank you.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.428
Though, I, um--
I keep thinking

19:21.461 --> 19:23.796
about how you...

19:23.830 --> 19:25.632
realized who I am.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.901
What if others do, too?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.937
What happens to Thomas
if I'm hanged?

19:30.970 --> 19:35.475
You sound
just like my husband,
worrying too much.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.510
- Your husband?
- Aye.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.812
My Joseph.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.949
He's with Clinton's army
in New York.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.917
A gentle man.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.320
Loves to tinker.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.888
If I can help him
stay safe

19:48.921 --> 19:51.791
by pretending to be
something I'm not,

19:51.824 --> 19:53.526
that's fine by me.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.363
You miss him?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.666
More than anything.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.205
I miss Abraham, too.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.979
When Thomas asks after him,
it breaks my heart.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.315
You're doing this
for him

20:15.348 --> 20:17.584
and little Thomas.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.752
Look, don't you worry.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.988
We'll stick
together, huh?

20:22.021 --> 20:24.257
You and me.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.626
Just the two of us
against the rest.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.831
**

20:39.706 --> 20:42.742
- ( bell tolling )
- ( chatter )

20:57.023 --> 20:59.025
**

21:10.770 --> 21:13.873
Tell Mrs. Arnold
slip 23 by the battery.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.709
Wednesday between
9:00 and 10:00.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.745
Wednesday? Tomorrow?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.047
That won't work at all.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.382
Why not?

21:22.415 --> 21:23.783
Mrs. Arnold
has a friend in visiting

21:23.816 --> 21:25.452
who leaves
Thursday morning.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.987
All right, well,
Thursday then,

21:28.020 --> 21:29.822
but it has to be
before midnight.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.392
- But the general
only goes outside--
- ( door opens )

21:39.432 --> 21:41.601
This isn't about Arnold.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.603
I don't give a damn
about Arnold.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.738
This is about Simcoe.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.611
I need Cicero
to summon him to the house,
same as he did me.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.880
You'll show him to a chair
facing the fireplace,

21:53.913 --> 21:55.482
and I'll do the rest.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.084
No. No, I won't be
party to murder.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.821
I'll take care of the body.
There won't be any trace.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.390
What about Cicero?

22:03.423 --> 22:05.358
Or do you think no one
will witness my boy

22:05.392 --> 22:06.626
calling him
to the house?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.795
I'm sorry.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.532
I saw Jordan.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.737
- Akinbode?
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.639
Where would you
have seen him?

22:19.672 --> 22:20.873
Connecticut.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.709
He saved my life
from Simcoe's men

22:22.742 --> 22:24.677
after they killed
my father in an ambush.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.112
He came
with Tory privateers

22:26.145 --> 22:29.048
who brought
the ransom money
with them.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.151
- The 300 pounds?
- Five hundred.
I'm telling the truth.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.621
Now, he killed
too many Rangers that day
for Simcoe to forget it.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.056
He can't come back to the city,
and he can't come back for you.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.792
With Simcoe still here.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.961
All you have to do
is open the door.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.834
Cicero doesn't deliver
the summons.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.602
You have
to get him there.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.073
Thursday.

23:02.482 --> 23:02.882
( chatter )

23:08.120 --> 23:09.121
( screams )

23:12.124 --> 23:13.125
( sizzling )

23:15.495 --> 23:17.730
( screaming )

23:17.764 --> 23:20.800
Caleb.
You didn't hear me
calling for you?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.935
Sorry.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.738
F-fire-- fire must've
mesmerized me.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.707
Well, we've got
the signal from New York.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.910
- Look.
- "Lace Cravates
In Three Varieties," right.

23:30.943 --> 23:34.113
That means that Champe
is ready for pickup tomorrow.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.949
I know it doesn't leave
much time to row
down the Hudson.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.687
Yeah, we were gonna
cross at Newark.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.054
All right, fine.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.956
Have you found
a second rower yet?

23:48.661 --> 23:50.663
Caleb.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.732
Second rower.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.133
It's gotta be
Teddy Beddows.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.136
He's-- he hates Arnold,

23:57.169 --> 24:00.172
and, uh, knows
how to work an oar.

24:00.206 --> 24:03.042
- Right.
- Well, at least
his brother could.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.678
That's good.
He owes us one,
so he'll be discreet.

24:05.712 --> 24:06.946
Mm.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.749
Caleb, are you
feeling all right?

24:09.782 --> 24:12.485
Yeah.
Just grand.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.788
Are you done
drinking yet?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.026
**

24:31.237 --> 24:32.972
Now I am.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.519
Sorry I'm late.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.121
Have you heard
anything?

24:49.155 --> 24:51.524
We've had the signal
for pickup.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.093
His mission is moving forward
and he should be back safely
in a few days.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.629
- That's wonderful.
- Have you heard anything?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.800
( sighs )
I'm-- I'm trying
to be discreet,

25:00.833 --> 25:03.135
nudge small details
one at a time.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.305
I did learn
that she has a husband
in the British army.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.642
- That's why she does this.
- No, we don't need to know
her reasons.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.644
We need to know who else
she's working with

25:11.678 --> 25:14.513
so that the hangman knows
how many nooses to ready.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.950
I need a few more days.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.727
Benedict:
Perhaps a march
into Jersey.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.161
We'll call it
a training exercise.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.863
Dundas:
Clinton will never
approve it.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.832
We have to show him
what our new legion
is capable of.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.234
Simcoe. John?

25:35.267 --> 25:38.738
What do you think
Clinton needs to see from us
in order to send us out?

25:38.771 --> 25:41.774
I was never good
at army politics,
I'm afraid.

25:41.808 --> 25:45.144
I prefer the field
to the forum.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.580
If we had
a proper cavalry,

25:47.614 --> 25:49.215
it would be a more
attractive package.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.883
I have the horses,
but not the hay.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.284
Ask the quartermaster.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.587
Damn the quartermaster.
Cooke's no friend to me.

25:54.621 --> 25:57.189
Not since I took
one of his suppliers
into our ranks.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.058
Who? A merchant?

25:59.091 --> 26:02.094
Some hog farmer
from Long Island.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.163
Perhaps you
could appeal to Cooke.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.866
That farmer,
what was his name?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.702
Woodhull.
His father was
killed by rebels.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.270
He joined up
for revenge.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.172
You know him?

26:13.205 --> 26:15.207
His name
sounds familiar.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.813
Benedict:
You take care of the hay,
I'll bring 30 horses.

26:20.847 --> 26:23.315
( conversation continues
indistinctly )

26:23.349 --> 26:25.584
**

26:28.387 --> 26:30.022
Man:
Major!

26:30.056 --> 26:31.958
Beddows? What the hell
are you still doing here?

26:31.991 --> 26:34.293
- You should've left hours ago.
- Major, it's-- it's Caleb.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.395
I met him when he said to,
but he's not ready to go.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.831
I tried to get him to,
but I don't even think he can.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.833
He's, uh, out of sorts.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.935
- Out of sorts?
What do you--
- Drunk and wild.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.170
Oh, God.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.838
All right, come on.
Come on.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.043
Benny boy!
( laughs )

26:51.077 --> 26:54.113
Do you know
how handsome you are
in that uniform?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.749
We need to get you a lady
before the war is ends.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.185
And one who isn't Anna,
because she is taken!

26:59.218 --> 27:01.087
You find this funny,
do you? Yeah?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.655
Shirking
your responsibilities.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.324
Get off your sorry arse
and face me!

27:05.357 --> 27:07.794
You're derelict of duty
and you're lucky

27:07.827 --> 27:09.729
if I don't choose
to have you court martialed.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.430
- You hear me?
- Get off.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.165
What? What?

27:13.199 --> 27:16.268
What have you got to say
for yourself? Huh?

27:16.302 --> 27:19.438
I did this to save
the mission, all right?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.940
Yeah.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.742
You're better off
without me.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.243
You all are.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.312
What are you
even talking about?
Can you hear yourself?

27:26.345 --> 27:28.881
No, I can't hear meself!

27:28.915 --> 27:31.918
All I hear is Simcoe!

27:31.951 --> 27:33.753
He's in there!

27:33.786 --> 27:36.923
He won!

27:36.956 --> 27:40.059
I can't stop seeing
that bastard's face

27:40.092 --> 27:43.896
when he thanked me
for giving up my friends!

27:45.297 --> 27:46.966
Caleb...

27:48.968 --> 27:50.402
Caleb, listen to me.

27:50.436 --> 27:53.005
- That never happened.
- ( crying )

27:53.039 --> 27:55.808
Caleb, look at me.
That never...

27:55.842 --> 27:57.343
( crying continues )

28:00.279 --> 28:03.449
You know,
you could have
told me sooner.

28:20.099 --> 28:20.967
So, Williams, you take
Reid's cooking duty.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.837
Reid, you take
my latrine duty.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.438
Two of you split
a bottle of rum.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.240
I take Williams'
guard duty tonight.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.976
- With me.
- And you get your own rum.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.210
Sold.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.945
- I suppose.
- Perfect.

28:32.979 --> 28:36.382
Did I just hear you
slough off duty in
exchange for rum?

28:38.017 --> 28:39.485
Where's my share?

28:41.788 --> 28:44.123
I'll sort this.
Come on.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.398
Why are you switching
to guard duty tonight?

28:52.431 --> 28:54.133
I need you at the back
of the house, not the front.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.203
- Change of plans.
- What?

28:57.236 --> 29:01.007
You'll take Arnold by slip 23,
right near the pickup.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.310
He'll be on a carriage ride
with his wife, just them,

29:04.343 --> 29:07.046
sometime between
9:00 and 10:00.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.981
Damn it, man,
I told you--

29:09.015 --> 29:10.917
And now I'm telling you.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.554
Arnold is your job.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.223
So see it done.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.794
**

29:21.828 --> 29:24.230
Hey, where you going?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.999
- Get the rum.
- The rum.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.903
What about
that one there?

29:30.937 --> 29:32.805
( chatter continues )

29:35.574 --> 29:37.509
The rum...

29:37.543 --> 29:39.879
**

29:51.891 --> 29:53.392
Hewlett:
What if he doesn't
come alone?

29:53.425 --> 29:54.961
Well, who would he bring?
Falkoff?

29:54.994 --> 29:56.595
The invite will be
for Simcoe only.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.330
What about the noise?

29:58.364 --> 30:01.200
Knife to throat.
Quiet as it gets.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.902
What about the blood?

30:02.935 --> 30:04.871
Pillowcase.
Clean up the mess.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.006
How did you get
the house servants
to cooperate with you?

30:07.039 --> 30:09.008
How can you trust them?

30:09.041 --> 30:10.376
Trust me.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.913
- Oh, please.
- Well, then trust the plan.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.347
You know it's the best
we have so far.

30:15.381 --> 30:16.883
You know it'll work.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.317
- It could.
- It will!

30:19.651 --> 30:21.520
If you get the message
to Simcoe

30:21.553 --> 30:24.523
and make him believe
that it came from Arnold.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.893
Forging the summons
isn't the problem.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.295
Injecting it properly
into the courier system,

30:29.328 --> 30:30.997
that's the trick.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.332
Well,
then work your magic,

30:33.365 --> 30:35.234
and the bastard
dies tonight.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.617
Recruitment's not here.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.619
Oh, uh, thank you, no.
I'm not here--

30:53.652 --> 30:55.587
He's a Quaker,
Sergeant.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.289
Dowling:
What are you doing here?

30:57.323 --> 30:58.925
I was sent
by James Rivington

30:58.958 --> 31:00.927
to deliver this bill
to General Arnold.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.594
Dowling:
A bill?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.596
Yes.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.333
He's run up quite the debt
at our coffeehouse, I'm afraid.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.336
Are you serious?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.671
Quite serious, actually.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.908
It requires
immediate attention.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.410
If he does not
settle payment,

31:18.444 --> 31:20.980
he will be barred
from the establishment.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.315
I don't suppose the general
likes the paying part

31:23.349 --> 31:25.084
of spending very much.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.486
- ( soldiers laugh )
- Enough!

31:29.288 --> 31:31.958
I'll see he gets it.
Thank you.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.927
- I really must insist--
- Thank you!

31:41.100 --> 31:44.470
- ( door opens, closes )
- Just how slow are you bastards
at cleaning your guns?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.238
Mine's done, Sergeant!

31:46.272 --> 31:48.074
Permission to take
some air!

31:48.107 --> 31:51.310
No, Sergeant, you may not.
You know why?

31:51.343 --> 31:53.045
This place
is a plague den!

31:53.079 --> 31:56.082
Look at it!
A disgrace!

31:56.115 --> 31:58.384
I want you to get out
your boot brushes

31:58.417 --> 32:01.453
and scrub this barracks
from top to bottom!

32:03.189 --> 32:05.291
Where's Woodhull?

32:05.324 --> 32:06.692
Where's Reid?

32:06.725 --> 32:10.529
Why is everyone
on a damned break?!

32:12.564 --> 32:15.634
So, Woodhull arranged
to take guard duty tonight

32:15.667 --> 32:17.236
at General Arnold's home?

32:17.269 --> 32:18.404
That's right.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.372
Thank you,
Corporal Reid.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.709
Sir, I thought you wanted word
on the general, like usual.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.711
Why all the sudden interest
in this private?

32:25.744 --> 32:28.514
What I'm interested in
is you keeping

32:28.547 --> 32:30.349
your mouth shut,
Corporal.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.252
Or we shut it for you.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.686
( coins jingle )

32:39.558 --> 32:41.593
So, how long was Woodhull
at Hewlett's office?

32:41.627 --> 32:43.662
About a half hour is all.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.264
And you're sure
he didn't see you

32:45.297 --> 32:47.433
follow him
from the barracks?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.368
Aye, aye,
pretty sure.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.470
General Arnold's house.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.440
Perhaps he's the target.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.475
Should we warn him?

32:56.508 --> 32:58.544
It's still light out.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.512
Let's have another round.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.018
- ( horse whinnies )
- ( crickets chirping )

33:08.620 --> 33:10.289
( bangs )

33:10.322 --> 33:12.291
- ( horse snorts )
- Driver: Hup!

33:12.324 --> 33:15.094
- ( reins flick )
- ( horse neighs )

33:15.127 --> 33:18.230
( hurdy-gurdy playing )

33:18.264 --> 33:20.666
( chatter )

33:32.711 --> 33:36.715
General Arnold wishes
to see me at his house.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.451
Suppose he isn't
the target after all.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.353
I'll take the boys

33:41.387 --> 33:42.788
and we'll gut
the little farmer.

33:42.821 --> 33:46.158
Oh, I think I can
handle this myself.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.427
You men enjoy
the music.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.308
( crickets chirping )

34:02.341 --> 34:04.643
- ( distant horse neighs )
- ( distant man shouts )

34:04.676 --> 34:07.246
Well, not long left
on watch now.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.447
Why don't you go?
I'll cover you.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.617
What's in it for you?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.685
Peace and quiet.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.628
**

34:26.797 --> 34:28.534
( knock on door )

34:56.161 --> 34:58.197
( crickets chirping )

35:15.781 --> 35:17.783
( knock on door )

35:22.488 --> 35:24.723
Colonel Simcoe
to see General Arnold.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.828
The general
is right this way.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.841
( floorboards creak )

36:07.233 --> 36:08.934
He'll be right with you.

36:26.252 --> 36:28.320
( floorboards creak )

36:32.758 --> 36:35.427
Honestly Benedict,
why leave in such a rush?

36:35.461 --> 36:36.862
Why be so rude
to our hosts?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.497
I couldn't say
in front of them.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.566
Everyone will understand
soon enough.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.271
( distant horse whinnies )

36:45.304 --> 36:47.373
**

36:51.410 --> 36:52.444
( pistol cocks )

37:02.321 --> 37:05.391
Cicero, get my travel ca--
what are you doing here?

37:05.424 --> 37:07.826
I... received
your message.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.896
My message?
What message?

37:10.929 --> 37:12.764
Oh, you mean this?

37:12.798 --> 37:15.267
Clinton informed you
as well?

37:15.301 --> 37:16.702
Simcoe:
No, I haven't
heard from him.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.405
- What is it?
- Benedict: Read it.

37:19.438 --> 37:23.709
Cicero, ready my travel case
immediately and gather
your things.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.345
**

37:44.996 --> 37:48.367
There he is!

37:48.400 --> 37:50.436
Where the hell were you?!

37:50.469 --> 37:53.305
- Get in your bunk!
- Yes, Sergeant!

37:53.339 --> 37:54.640
( crickets chirping )

37:54.673 --> 37:56.274
Peggy:
Can you tell me now?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.547
I'm leading my men
to Virginia.

38:01.580 --> 38:06.385
It's finally my chance
to do what I'm best at.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.588
I-- I do regret
the timing.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.525
We'll manage.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.461
Be brave.

38:21.967 --> 38:25.571
Take the best possible care
of Mrs. Arnold.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.607
This child
is the most precious thing
in the world to me.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.481
Come on, Cicero,
we're off.

38:37.716 --> 38:41.052
Don't give nobody cause
to bring you any trouble.

38:41.086 --> 38:44.089
You listen good
and stick close
to the general.

38:50.095 --> 38:54.032
( door opens, closes )

39:03.942 --> 39:06.778
- What's going on?
- We don't know.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.414
( whispers )
I hear we're getting
punished.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.749
In the middle
of the night?
Idiot.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.852
- ( door opens )
- Well, maybe it's a drill.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.487
( door closes )

39:15.521 --> 39:17.489
Take care!

39:20.091 --> 39:21.893
Gentlemen...

39:21.927 --> 39:24.029
the time has come
for what we live for--

39:25.431 --> 39:26.998
battle.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.636
The glory, the honor...

39:30.669 --> 39:33.138
the legend of it.

39:33.171 --> 39:37.108
Today,
we move on the enemy.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.479
We've received emergency orders
from General Clinton

39:40.512 --> 39:42.548
to leave
for Virginia tonight,

39:42.581 --> 39:45.183
where we will augment
Cornwallis' drive

39:45.216 --> 39:47.986
to defeat the rebels
in the South.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.855
Report to the docks, men.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.891
Sergeants,
come receive your orders.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.893
Go. Go!

39:56.161 --> 39:58.630
Virginia?

39:58.664 --> 40:01.132
But this wasn't
supposed to happen.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.602
We're supposed
to stay here.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.037
**

40:06.071 --> 40:08.206
( overlapping voices )
Left, right, turn.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.543
Right wheel.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.845
Left, left,

40:13.879 --> 40:17.115
left, left.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.885
- Halt!
- Hup, hup...

40:19.918 --> 40:21.987
Hup, hup.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.089
Left, halt!

40:24.122 --> 40:27.192
Left, left, left.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.129
Halt!

40:31.162 --> 40:33.765
Rangers,
to the first boat!

40:35.266 --> 40:39.070
American Legion,
you're in the second!

40:39.104 --> 40:41.239
80th Foot to the third!

40:41.272 --> 40:43.975
Rangers, quick march!

40:46.645 --> 40:50.181
American Legion,
about face!

40:50.215 --> 40:51.950
March!

41:01.827 --> 41:03.629
I don't see anyone.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.033
They should
be here by now.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.035
Could be running
a bit late.

41:11.537 --> 41:12.638
What's that?

41:20.245 --> 41:22.047
Looks like
they're loading on.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.818
Oh, no, they must be
shipping out.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.590

41:39.264 --> 41:40.866
( man shouting orders )

41:40.899 --> 41:43.001
Get the cover
on that hatch!

41:49.941 --> 41:52.944
I look forward to fighting
under your command, sir.

41:52.978 --> 41:56.848
Benedict:
Finally, we'll meet
the bloody rebels in combat.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.685
They've managed to survive
up until now.

41:59.718 --> 42:03.188
But it will be on the field
that we truly settle
our accounts.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.310
