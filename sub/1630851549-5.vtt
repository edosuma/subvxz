WEBVTT

00:08.356 --> 00:10.053
Congrats, Reagan.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.185
For what?

00:11.228 --> 00:13.535
Jason Lipkis goes down
for three murders

00:13.578 --> 00:16.059
and will never see sunlight
as a free man again.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.714
But all three of his vics
are still dead.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.759
Well, that's...
out of our hands.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.109
I know. But
don't you wish

00:22.152 --> 00:23.936
we could just get
ahead of it sometime?

00:23.980 --> 00:26.156
I mean, stop something
before it goes south?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.462
Like that.

00:27.505 --> 00:28.680
Been seeing these
things everywhere.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.073
I mean, why
can't we help her?

00:30.117 --> 00:33.120
"My name is Angie Shaw
and I am lost in New York.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.426
Please help my brother David
find me."

00:35.470 --> 00:37.689
Okay, well, why don't
you give him a call?

00:37.733 --> 00:39.387
We don't have
- to call him.
- Why not?

00:39.430 --> 00:41.911
He's standing right there,
handing out the flyers.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.609
Hey. Scuse me.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.090
Detective Reagan. My
partner, Detective Baez.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.396
Okay, I'll stop.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.093
- Come again?
- Last cop who came up

00:50.137 --> 00:51.703
said I was harassing people

00:51.747 --> 00:54.010
and defacing public property
with these.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.708
Good. So you've
already talked to the cops.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.362
Here, back in Akron,

00:58.406 --> 00:59.972
half the time,
they don't return my calls.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.365
Half the time,
they don't have a clue.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.975
Well, your sister's
still missing, right?

01:03.019 --> 01:05.717
It's just, uh, she's not well.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.284
So, uh...

01:07.328 --> 01:09.808
you know, if I don't find her...

01:09.852 --> 01:12.376
You don't have to.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.161
We're gonna find her.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.517
<i>Hey, Eddie.</i>

01:23.039 --> 01:24.084
Hey. What's up?

01:24.127 --> 01:26.651
Are you related
to an Armin Janko?

01:27.435 --> 01:29.611
Um, yeah, he's my dad.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.309
So then you'll want
to talk to him.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.006
"hell" and "no."

01:34.050 --> 01:35.747
And after you tell him that,
hang up fast

01:35.791 --> 01:37.923
or he's gonna try and find a way
to empty your wallet.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.317
Oh, he's not on the phone.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.927
He's in the holding cell.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.895
Dad?

01:53.678 --> 01:55.245
Sweetheart.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.294
- What are the odds, huh?
- That you'd break out

02:00.337 --> 02:02.383
of prison? I'd say
that's a pretty sure bet.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.646
No, I was released
a couple of weeks ago.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.648
Uh, finally.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.084
I'm a free man.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.999
Says the guy behind bars.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.522
Just a misunderstanding.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.394
I can get it cleared up.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.439
So, what, you've been
out, like, two weeks

02:15.483 --> 02:17.006
and you haven't
even called me?

02:17.049 --> 02:20.488
Only because whatever
I would've done before--

02:20.531 --> 02:21.837
the-the lying,

02:21.880 --> 02:23.447
the scheming--

02:23.491 --> 02:24.840
now I do the opposite.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.668
Including ignoring
your daughter.

02:26.711 --> 02:30.541
I didn't want you to think
I was asking for anything.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.891
I can't believe this.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.937
All right, Mr. Janko.

02:38.549 --> 02:39.855
Next stop is Central Booking.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.031
I've turned over a new leaf,
sweetheart.

02:42.074 --> 02:45.034
It was really great seeing you.

02:50.866 --> 02:51.867
<i>Carrie Ewbanks.</i>

02:51.910 --> 02:53.869
Anthony.
Thanks for coming.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.567
Let me guess--
they found a floater.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.787
Nope, just diving
with GoPros,

02:58.830 --> 02:59.788
searching the river.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.224
What, for hepatitis?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.835
Dropped iPhones, lost sunglasses.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.620
Apparently, it's
a YouTube thing.

03:05.663 --> 03:08.623
And this time,
they found this.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.413
You got to be kidding me.10mm

03:16.457 --> 03:18.415
1911 with pearl grips.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.765
From that old homicide
of yours, right?

03:20.809 --> 03:21.984
Shooter was,

03:22.027 --> 03:23.246
uh, Jane...?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.466
Jade. Jade Jones.
But that was six years ago.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.382
She said she tossed it in the
water a quarter mile from here.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.774
Time and tide, I guess.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.298
But if that is the gun...

03:31.341 --> 03:34.475
Got to get it back in water
before it oxidizes even more.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.737
What I meant was...

03:35.780 --> 03:37.129
Yeah, I know
what you meant.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.305
If this is the gun,

03:38.348 --> 03:40.611
I might've put
an innocent girl in prison.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.970
He's here?

03:52.754 --> 03:55.365
He is. And he's hot.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.587
So the archbishop is hot.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.242
He is.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.071
Okay. Let's have him.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.336
I don't know.

04:13.644 --> 04:14.863
Your Eminence.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.779
Don't act so respectful, Frank.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.042
It seems there is a problem.

04:20.085 --> 04:22.392
And playing dumb
suits you even less.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.220
Hey. Please, sit.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.048
I'll stand, thank you.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.006
Okay.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.748
Father Mike McDougal.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.795
Yes. What about him?

04:33.838 --> 04:35.753
His apartment
was burglarized last night.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.102
Is he okay?

04:37.146 --> 04:38.974
He's pretty shook up,
but he'll be fine.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.106
Someone probably cased
him as an easy mark,

04:41.150 --> 04:44.980
seeing as he spends most of
his days outside our precincts

04:45.023 --> 04:47.461
with a bullhorn, yelling,
"Defund the police."

04:47.504 --> 04:49.941
He has a right to free speech.

04:49.985 --> 04:52.640
- No one is disputing that.
- He also has

04:52.683 --> 04:54.772
a right to make a 911 call.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.210
He didn't.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.517
This isn't funny, Frank.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.737
Come on.
It's a little bit funny, Kevin.

05:02.780 --> 05:03.390
I'll tell you

05:03.433 --> 05:04.782
what's not funny.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.871
The fact that someone
in your department

05:06.915 --> 05:09.309
leaked the tape of his 911 call.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.312
Probably hitting their websites
even as we speak.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.575
I know this, because reporters
have been calling me

05:14.618 --> 05:16.054
for a comment.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.275
Kevin, I'm sorry.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.016
Yeah, well, in today's world,

05:21.059 --> 05:23.366
"sorry" is
woefully insufficient.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.976
Well, in this case,
well-intentioned.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.978
Well, I'll tell you
what's not well-intentioned.

05:27.022 --> 05:30.025
The fact that, every day,
there's a new existential crisis

05:30.068 --> 05:31.983
in the institutions
of our country.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.855
What we once thought was eternal

05:33.898 --> 05:35.857
is now being cast aside
by the mob.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.554
Hey, they're at my gates, too.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.904
You've embarrassed the Church,
Frank.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.692
Not the priest who
is throwing gasoline

05:44.735 --> 05:47.912
on the fires that burn
in this city day and night?

05:47.956 --> 05:49.740
This is about the person
in your department

05:49.784 --> 05:51.829
who leaked
confidential information.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.178
Well, when the person is found,

05:53.222 --> 05:55.398
measures will be swift
and appropriate.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.967
Thank you, but I need more
than just a slap on the wrist.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.536
<i>You</i> need?

06:02.579 --> 06:03.798
Yes.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.669
The dignity of the Church
demands it.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.933
Kevin, you once told me
you had nothing but respect

06:08.977 --> 06:11.588
for the boundaries
between our two spheres.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.199
Non-overlapping magisteria.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.941
So please don't tell me
how to do my job.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.466
I wouldn't dream of it.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.858
Good.

06:23.121 --> 06:26.473
But, uh, you might want
to ask yourself

06:26.516 --> 06:28.431
what's more important,

06:28.475 --> 06:30.433
your office

06:30.477 --> 06:32.087
or your faith?

07:02.509 --> 07:04.424
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.644
Well, the trespassing charge
- is not dropped, Dad.
- Uh-huh.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.429
It's what's called
a desk appearance ticket.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.561
And if you don't show up
for your court date... I'll show up.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.128
- I promise.
- Well, I don't know
what that's worth.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.173
Because, you know, I
also talked to the lady

07:15.217 --> 07:17.654
at the halfway house
you were staying at... That was not court-mandated.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.439
Well, you s... I'm-- It's a private group.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.614
You still bailed.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.093
I couldn't stay
with those people.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.573
You are one of those people.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.750
I was. But not
five minutes out of prison,

07:26.794 --> 07:28.360
they're all back
to their old ways.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.884
They're ripping
each other off,

07:29.927 --> 07:32.016
they're s--
uh, scoring drugs.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.497
There was even
this big lug of a guy,

07:34.541 --> 07:37.587
said he heard I was
a financial whiz

07:37.631 --> 07:41.112
so I should help him
launder his money or else.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.940
I had to get out.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.247
Wait, where have you
been staying, Dad?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.119
You know, around.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.773
Like on the street?

07:49.817 --> 07:51.427
Honey.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.255
Thanks again.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.257
A-And I'll make
that court date.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.652
Dad, you're not going anywhere.

07:59.566 --> 08:04.484
In order to qualify for the DAT,
you need a verifiable address.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.095
You didn't.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.751
Against my better judgment.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.497
And you drove
from where?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.368
Uh, from Akron, two weeks ago.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.631
Because your sister
has problems.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.285
It is not her fault.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.809
Our mom passed away
when we were kids,

08:25.853 --> 08:27.768
and our dad raised us.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.510
But... he was always drunk.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.554
He never worked.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.643
And he forced Angie

08:33.687 --> 08:35.427
to wait on him hand and foot,

08:35.471 --> 08:36.428
night and day.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.386
And you?

08:37.429 --> 08:38.605
He was horrible to me, too.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.476
But I got married when I was 18,

08:40.520 --> 08:41.956
so I was able to move out.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.479
But she had to stay.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.481
Till the day he died.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.961
She didn't even want
a funeral.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.876
She just said she was using
what little money he had

08:48.919 --> 08:52.706
to come to New York and finally
live the life she deserves.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.143
What about the flyers
you put up?

08:55.186 --> 08:56.405
Any tips from that?

08:56.448 --> 08:57.754
Crank calls,
mostly.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.278
Uh, there was a homeless man
who swears he...

09:00.322 --> 09:03.934
saw her at a food bank and
that she's calling herself Kim.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.763
But he wanted 500 bucks

09:06.807 --> 09:09.026
to tell me which one,
and...

09:09.070 --> 09:10.332
I didn't have it.

09:11.159 --> 09:14.118
Well, you don't have
to give us a dime.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.511
Give us a call

09:15.555 --> 09:18.645
if you think of anything
or hear anything else.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.690
Um, and you guys are
for real? Like, um,

09:20.734 --> 09:22.997
I said, the cops
have been pretty useless.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.566
That's them. We're us.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.228
Well, gee,

09:37.272 --> 09:38.752
I didn't get you anything.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.623
I need to
reopen a case.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.843
You want to explain
or do I just hop to it?

09:42.886 --> 09:45.628
One of the last cases
I caught with the NYPD

09:45.672 --> 09:47.978
was the homicide
of a Black Lotus boy.

09:48.022 --> 09:52.069
I put away a member of a female
gang out of East New York.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.549
Jade Jones.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.682
Except that Jade always said
that she didn't do it,

09:55.725 --> 09:58.293
that she was ordered to
but that she tossed the gun

09:58.336 --> 09:59.381
in the East River instead.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.470
- Just relax. Take a breath.
- Yeah,

10:01.513 --> 10:03.733
but-but if that's the gun, she
might've been telling the truth.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.169
Where did you get this anyway?

10:05.213 --> 10:07.258
And don't tell me
you recently picked up swimming.

10:07.302 --> 10:10.174
Some divers found it, and
they gave it to a detective.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.438
Carrie Ewbanks.

10:13.482 --> 10:14.744
I, uh...

10:14.788 --> 10:16.703
kind of borrowed
it from her.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.140
And broke chain of custody?

10:19.183 --> 10:20.620
Yeah, but so what? Eh...

10:20.663 --> 10:22.665
Okay, Anthony,
you see all these papers

10:22.709 --> 10:23.927
that you just got wet?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.625
These are
for a trial tomorrow

10:25.668 --> 10:27.409
that still needs
critical information,

10:27.452 --> 10:29.541
which I do believe
I asked you for.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.588
Yeah, but we both know that
the system gets things wrong.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.981
What if that happened here?

10:34.024 --> 10:35.678
Well, then she
will get justice.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.071
You promise?

10:37.114 --> 10:38.289
Of course.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.769
'Cause the moment
I saw that gun, uh...

10:39.813 --> 10:43.164
all I could think of is, uh,
Jade screaming at the jury

10:43.207 --> 10:45.079
that she was innocent.

10:45.122 --> 10:48.735
Well, all the more reason why
we should do this right.

10:48.778 --> 10:52.129
So I will get this gun back
to Detective Ewbanks

10:52.173 --> 10:55.045
to be vouchered properly
while you get back to work

10:55.089 --> 10:56.568
and deliver me what I need.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.658
In the meantime,
I'm due

10:58.701 --> 11:00.485
before a judge
who hopefully won't mind

11:00.529 --> 11:03.358
that my motion
now smells like low tide.

11:07.318 --> 11:10.234
And the archdiocese
called to say all parishes

11:10.278 --> 11:14.195
that hold our outreach
events are now unavailable

11:14.238 --> 11:16.066
due to scheduling conflicts.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.896
All because his guy got called
out for the hypocrite he is.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.682
Well, I'm concerned
about our guy, okay?

11:22.725 --> 11:25.162
Who deserves a medal,
you ask me.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.511
I didn't ask, Sid.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.166
But, Frank, it's playing well
with the public.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.690
And every PD
in this country

11:30.733 --> 11:32.909
apparently is raising
a glass to us.

11:32.953 --> 11:36.347
And leaking it is a violation
of department policy.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.871
If McDougal didn't want heat,

11:37.914 --> 11:40.961
maybe he should've called
on his better angels, not us.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.746
And now several members
of the city council

11:43.790 --> 11:46.749
are going on the record that
his "defund the police" mantra

11:46.793 --> 11:47.576
is overkill.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.838
See, boss?

11:48.882 --> 11:50.710
Take the win.

11:53.669 --> 11:56.977
If I lose Kevin Kearns,
it's no win.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.982
Sir, our enemies fight
dirty all the time.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.421
So maybe a little
asymmetrical warfare

12:06.464 --> 12:08.423
levels the playing field.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.818
And if make an enemy
of the Church,

12:11.861 --> 12:13.863
everyone loses.

12:16.518 --> 12:19.086
That's all for now.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.091
Abigail, you stay.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.881
Let's talk for a minute.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.980
You just found a guy and
just told him we'd help him?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.025
A random guy?

12:45.068 --> 12:46.635
No, his sister's
missing, boss.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.376
I mean,
just have a heart.

12:48.419 --> 12:48.985
Okay, so?

12:49.029 --> 12:50.073
So, dead ends.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.814
- But for now.
- Yeah, no.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.164
You got one more day and this
case goes to Missing Persons.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.644
But, boss, I promised him.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.993
You promised
him what?

12:57.037 --> 12:59.126
You take cases off rotation.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.823
You don't take strays
off the street.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.694
You got 24 hours and that's it.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.131
All right. Great.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.959
Detectives.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.830
Mr. Shaw,we said

13:07.874 --> 13:09.223
we were gonna
give you a call.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.399
You're giving up, aren't you?

13:11.442 --> 13:13.096
Says who?

13:13.140 --> 13:15.533
I can see it on your faces.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.926
Look, I get it.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.102
- You're busy.
- No.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.843
We're not too busy, okay?

13:20.887 --> 13:23.106
We dumped her cell phone.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.847
We have shelters, ERs

13:24.891 --> 13:26.980
and psych wards
still to look into.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.372
So, you want the truth,

13:28.416 --> 13:30.810
we're
kind of just getting started.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.855
Thank you.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.814
You're welcome.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.905
Honey, I'm home!

13:39.775 --> 13:41.385
Oh. Hey. Hey, babe.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.430
Um...

13:43.779 --> 13:45.520
I do something wrong?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.391
What?

13:47.435 --> 13:49.567
That's not for you. That's... Wow! A hot shower
feels so good.

13:49.611 --> 13:53.093
In Otisville, I swear, the water
came out only in cubes.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.836
Hello, son.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.750
Armin.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.491
Didn't know
we were harboring fugitives.

14:00.535 --> 14:01.579
Oh, no, no, no.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.320
He's not on the lam. He...

14:03.364 --> 14:04.365
got out.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.367
No way.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.673
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.893
Hey, Dad, could you...?

14:10.937 --> 14:12.373
Ah.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.853
Yeah.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.160
He doesn't have
anywhere else to go.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.032
Well, I'm pretty sure
we could find him a hotel

14:19.075 --> 14:20.511
in the city somewhere or...

14:20.555 --> 14:22.644
No, it's only for a few days.
It...

14:22.687 --> 14:24.733
I know you don't like him.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.301
What? It's not that.
I barely know him.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.911
Well, then what?

14:28.955 --> 14:31.261
Hey, I don't like the
effect he has on you.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.960
Every time he comes walking
back into your life, you--

14:34.003 --> 14:35.918
I'm watching you cry
yourself to sleep.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.225
Well, this time,
my eyes are wide open.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.227
I locked up our guns,

14:40.270 --> 14:41.532
and I told him

14:41.576 --> 14:42.751
he's on house arrest

14:42.794 --> 14:44.057
while he looks
for a place of his own.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.929
So it's just you, me and
him on top of each other

14:46.973 --> 14:48.670
u-until who knows when?

14:48.713 --> 14:49.889
I know when.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.586
H-His court appearance.

14:51.629 --> 14:52.935
It's in three days.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.302
Morning.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.131
What time is it?

15:15.175 --> 15:16.176
It's, uh...

15:16.219 --> 15:18.004
- it's up on the wall.
- Wow.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.790
First time in years I haven't
had to sleep with one eye open.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.446
Where's Eddie?

15:25.489 --> 15:27.056
Work.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.231
And you?

15:28.275 --> 15:29.798
- Right here.
- I mean,

15:29.841 --> 15:31.191
you're not going in today?

15:31.234 --> 15:34.020
I'm, uh...
I'm working a midnight tonight.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.935
Oh. This is great.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.023
How's that?

15:37.066 --> 15:38.024
Look,

15:38.067 --> 15:39.416
I know you don't like me.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.418
Armin, can we--
can we not do that?

15:41.462 --> 15:44.639
No chance you taking this moment
and actually getting to know me?

15:44.682 --> 15:46.554
I think I know what I need to.

15:46.597 --> 15:47.947
Not what's in my heart.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.513
I know you're a con man

15:49.557 --> 15:51.863
and that you use people
without a care in the world

15:51.907 --> 15:53.735
as to who you hurt
in the process.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.519
Jamie... Look,

15:55.563 --> 15:57.086
just... get up,

15:57.130 --> 15:58.696
enjoy another hot shower

15:58.740 --> 16:01.308
and then get on your phone
and find someplace to live.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.526
While you're at it,

16:02.570 --> 16:03.875
count your blessings

16:03.919 --> 16:05.703
you got an absolute angel
for a daughter.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.154
<i>Is Your Eminence asking me
to cease</i>

16:21.197 --> 16:23.983
- and desist?
- I'm asking you
to dial it down.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.682
Dial down the most important
work I can do for my parish?

16:27.725 --> 16:29.162
Show me the
chapter and verse

16:29.205 --> 16:31.120
about demonstrating
outside police precincts.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.601
The Lord himself cast the money
changers out of the temple.

16:33.644 --> 16:34.819
Apples and oranges.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.604
Cast out those
who preyed on the poor.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.214
Which is exactly what
the police are doing.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.737
- Morning.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.051
What are you doing here?

16:49.095 --> 16:51.271
Well, I came to see you.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.274
And... Father McDougal here.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.928
How did you know
we would both be here?

16:57.973 --> 17:00.323
The driver of your
protection detail

17:00.367 --> 17:03.500
is an NYPD detective, so...

17:03.544 --> 17:04.980
Look,

17:05.024 --> 17:08.766
I just thought
it might ease tensions a little

17:08.810 --> 17:11.378
if I met Father McDougal myself.

17:11.421 --> 17:12.553
Commissioner,

17:12.596 --> 17:14.294
if you... No, please.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.209
It's Frank.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.559
And this is Lieutenant Gormley.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.220
Sid.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.744
Is Sid here for backup?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.572
As an example of
the men and women

17:31.615 --> 17:32.964
on the receiving end

17:33.008 --> 17:35.228
of Father McDougal's bullhorn.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.230
You know, the ones
you're trying to get us

17:37.273 --> 17:38.579
kicked out of our jobs.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.450
So this is an ambush?

17:40.494 --> 17:41.756
No.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.759
I simply wanted to
give the father here

17:44.802 --> 17:47.936
a chance to explain
how defunding the police

17:47.979 --> 17:50.460
would promote peace in our city.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.680
Pretty self-explanatory.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.421
Not really.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.771
Even after your place
was burglarized?

17:56.814 --> 17:58.773
I'm praying
for whoever did that.

17:58.816 --> 18:02.429
Since before or
after you called us?

18:02.472 --> 18:04.039
- Some respect?
- Hey,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.997
what was the phrase
you used in my office?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.434
Free speech is his right.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.610
- Your Eminence, I'm not
trying to be a jerk,

18:09.653 --> 18:11.133
but guys like him
who shoot off their mouth

18:11.177 --> 18:12.787
about stuff
they know nothing about,

18:12.830 --> 18:15.790
it's guys like me who
bear the brunt of it.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.661
We are the ones who get spat on.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.141
We are the ones
who get ambushed.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
When you're not
brutalizing our citizens.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.798
Oh, are you gonna tar
all of us with that brush?

18:23.841 --> 18:27.149
Because I'm sure all priests
don't like to be blamed

18:27.193 --> 18:28.237
for what some of you do.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.412
Okay, Sid.

18:29.456 --> 18:30.544
Finally.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.894
My point is only this--

18:32.937 --> 18:36.376
the system is broken
and needs to be reformed.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.204
Redirected resources,

18:38.247 --> 18:39.335
better training,

18:39.379 --> 18:40.684
a new attitude.

18:40.728 --> 18:45.515
That is not what
"defund the police" means.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.431
And it is not how it plays
out there.

18:48.475 --> 18:52.087
Even when it comes
from a priest wearing a collar.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.229
Yeah. Thank you.
We're done, Baez.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.665
Yeah, tell me
about it.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.362
No matches
for our Angie Shaw

19:06.406 --> 19:08.277
on LexisNexis... No, that's not what I mean.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.061
We found her.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.238
- How?
- I tracked down
the soup kitchen

19:12.281 --> 19:13.543
where the guy saw her.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.197
Seems the manager saw her, too,

19:15.241 --> 19:18.200
except she was going under
the name of Kim Banning.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.941
But she wasn't
there for a meal.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.509
She was applying for a job
from the "help wanted" ad

19:22.552 --> 19:24.206
as a bookkeeper.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.381
Did she get the job?

19:25.425 --> 19:27.340
No, but I got
her address.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.298
Detectives.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.866
Got it, boss.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.608
I got her
address. Let's go.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.697
You're messing with me.

19:36.740 --> 19:37.785
Jade, I'm not.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.482
And why would
I trust you?

19:39.526 --> 19:42.137
Look, I know you blame me
for you being in this hell.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.835
But finding that gun
may change things.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.881
Oh, as in I get out.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.317
Look,
I'm not promising anything.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.537
But I need your help
to go over

19:50.580 --> 19:52.365
some of the details of the case.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.844
It's been a long time.

19:53.888 --> 19:57.239
I remember everything
like it was yesterday.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.894
It's all I've had
to think about for years.

19:59.937 --> 20:00.982
Okay.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.158
So your gang sister testified

20:03.202 --> 20:05.682
that you not only did the hit
on the Black Lotus kid

20:05.726 --> 20:07.075
but that you bragged about it.

20:07.118 --> 20:10.209
She lied because she hates me.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.514
Even now.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.386
All my girls have come to visit
except her.

20:13.429 --> 20:16.171
On the night that you said
you threw the gun in the river,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.391
where exactly were you... Not another word!

20:21.394 --> 20:22.482
Not another word, Ms. Jones.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.266
You either, Anthony.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.313
Who are you?

20:27.356 --> 20:29.184
Assistant District
Attorney Erin Reagan.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.492
And this meeting is premature
and unsanctioned by my office.

20:32.535 --> 20:33.971
You were telling the truth?

20:34.015 --> 20:35.712
Now, how did you know
I was here with her?

20:35.756 --> 20:37.758
Because I know you.
Now let's go.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.499
You know,
technically,

20:39.542 --> 20:41.979
my boss is the D.A.
squad supervisor.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.590
You're gonna play
that card with me now?

20:43.633 --> 20:44.982
A-And you're
gonna let her sit here

20:45.026 --> 20:46.201
one more minute
than she needs to?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.334
- Let's go.
- There a problem, folks?

20:48.377 --> 20:51.772
Not at all, ma'am. I'm just
following my investigator out.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.469
No! You can't leave!

20:53.513 --> 20:56.167
- I'll be in touch, Jade.
- No. Not anytime soon.
I am sorry,

20:56.211 --> 20:59.127
Ms. Jones, if this has caused
any sort of confusion.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.738
You don't know the things
that they do to me in here!

21:01.869 --> 21:04.611
I get raped! And I get jumped!

21:04.654 --> 21:07.353
And none of this should've
happened because I'm innocent!

21:07.396 --> 21:08.615
Hey! Get back! Come on!

21:08.658 --> 21:10.312
Ms. Reagan!

21:10.356 --> 21:11.835
- You got to help me!
- Come on!

21:11.879 --> 21:14.490
- I don't belong in here!
- Come on! Let's go!

21:16.275 --> 21:17.885
I don't belong in here!

21:21.280 --> 21:22.368
Okay, Terry.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.674
Thanks anyway.

21:24.718 --> 21:25.632
Honey.

21:25.675 --> 21:26.850
Any luck on
the house hunt?

21:26.894 --> 21:29.113
Uh, not yet,
but I'll find a place.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.114
Okay.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.899
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.030
You're leaving?

21:33.074 --> 21:34.989
Yeah. I mean, I figured
I'd hit the gym

21:35.032 --> 21:36.730
before work, so...

21:36.773 --> 21:39.863
Well, I-I got a roast
for Sunday dinner.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.430
So, whip up

21:41.474 --> 21:42.910
a marinade
before you leave?

21:42.953 --> 21:44.607
S-Sure.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.573
You know, um...

21:53.616 --> 21:56.967
Eddie was telling me about,
uh, your family's tradition.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.405
Sounds nice.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.102
Yeah, sure is.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.582
Didn't you invite Lena once?

22:02.625 --> 22:05.236
Uh, well,
that was a wedding thing.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.108
Uh, you know,
remember our wedding,

22:07.151 --> 22:08.152
when you, uh... Jamie.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.850
- What?
- You're not wrong.

22:09.893 --> 22:13.549
But it might be easier for me
to move on from past mistakes

22:13.593 --> 22:16.465
if you weren't throwing 'em
in my face every five seconds.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.162
- Dad.
- Well, believe me,

22:18.206 --> 22:19.903
I'd love nothing more than
to think that you've cleaned up

22:19.947 --> 22:21.296
your act, Armin,
but you'll forgive me

22:21.340 --> 22:22.906
if I need just
a shred of evidence.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.169
You know what?
Even if I was invited,

22:25.213 --> 22:28.477
I couldn't go, because my job
now is to find a place of my own

22:28.521 --> 22:30.523
so I can get out of your hair.

22:48.715 --> 22:49.672
Kim Banning?

22:49.716 --> 22:50.760
Who are you?

22:50.804 --> 22:51.761
Detectives Reagan

22:51.805 --> 22:52.762
and Baez.

22:52.806 --> 22:53.807
What do you want?

22:53.850 --> 22:55.243
Well, to
check on you.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.767
Your brother's
been worried sick about you.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.769
That is you, right?

22:59.813 --> 23:01.205
Oh, my God.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.643
- What?
- He said he's my brother?

23:03.686 --> 23:05.122
- He's not?
- David Shaw

23:05.166 --> 23:06.907
is my ex-fiancé.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.125
He's been
stalking me

23:08.169 --> 23:09.257
for months.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.259
So your real name
isn't Angie Shaw?

23:11.302 --> 23:13.261
- Only if I'd married him.
- And your father

23:13.304 --> 23:15.437
wasn't a raving lunatic?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.918
He died of cancer
six months ago.

23:17.961 --> 23:21.965
And then I got laid off.
And it was all just too much.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.272
So I told David we'd have
to postpone the wedding.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.535
And he got upset.
Went ballistic?

23:26.579 --> 23:28.450
I really did love him once.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.670
But he wouldn't leave me alone.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.281
So, finally, I moved here
and changed my name

23:33.324 --> 23:34.456
just to get away.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.893
And now... you found me.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.939
It-It's okay. He doesn't know.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.462
But if you did, so could he.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.768
- Oh, my God!
- Okay. Look,

23:41.811 --> 23:43.160
here's what we're gonna do.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.858
We'll take you to
the squad room with us

23:44.901 --> 23:46.599
and we'll try to find
a judge who will give you

23:46.642 --> 23:48.775
an order of protection, okay?

23:52.648 --> 23:54.433
Okay.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.739
Okay, let me get my purse.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.263
Oh, geez, Reagan.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.395
What did we do?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.789
Not "we." It was me.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.921
Well, still,
Gee's gonna kill us.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.141
And he'll make us
work it still.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.011
You think?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.404
I can hear him now.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.232
"If you broke it,
you bought it."

24:12.189 --> 24:15.105
Maybe we saved her
from a stalker.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.324
Angie?

24:16.367 --> 24:17.804
You okay in there?

24:17.847 --> 24:20.459
Angie?!

24:20.502 --> 24:22.678
Coming in, Angie!

24:23.723 --> 24:25.376
The hell'd she go?

24:26.552 --> 24:28.075
Angie.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.818
You up there?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.005
Son of a bitch.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.224
You think
she ran out on us?

24:47.268 --> 24:48.791
Not without her
keys, she didn't.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.447
I think David
followed us here.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.362
Put it over the air.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.538
Now we're looking
for both of them.

25:08.811 --> 25:12.598
Well, you were missed at a
very lovely mass this morning.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.904
Well, there's a woman
missing out there somewhere,

25:14.948 --> 25:16.297
and I got
to find her, so...

25:16.340 --> 25:18.821
hopefully, God'll give me
a pass on this one.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.606
- I like Father
Cabrillo's sermons.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.608
It doesn't feel like
he's talking down to you.

25:22.651 --> 25:23.783
Puh!

25:23.826 --> 25:24.784
Not so much?

25:24.827 --> 25:25.872
Not today.

25:25.915 --> 25:28.570
Going on and on
about the-the pain

25:28.614 --> 25:31.138
of being betrayed
by people closest to you.

25:31.181 --> 25:35.142
Archbishop Kearns probably
dictated that directly to him.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.926
You're imagining things, Pop.

25:36.970 --> 25:39.320
The hell I am.
Kearns knows we always go

25:39.363 --> 25:40.626
to that noon mass there.

25:40.669 --> 25:43.542
And Cabrillo was looking
at you the whole time.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.891
He looked at everyone.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.762
Yes. And then
he'd look directly back

25:46.806 --> 25:49.112
to you making his next point.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.461
I can take it.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.812
Yeah. Dad's tough, Gramps.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.205
I liked that sermon, too.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.685
Not being able
to trust a stranger--

25:56.729 --> 25:58.948
that comes with
most territories. But...

25:58.992 --> 26:01.342
being betrayed
by someone closer to you,

26:01.385 --> 26:03.387
I imagine that's really hard.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.128
Hear, hear.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.826
Hmm. Still upset
at Anthony

26:06.869 --> 26:08.567
for the whole
bumper sticker fiasco?

26:08.610 --> 26:10.177
I don't want to talk about it.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.613
Except you already are.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.050
No. Hey, guys, that
was directed at me.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.356
Oh-ho.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.358
Trouble in paradise?

26:17.401 --> 26:19.142
Eddie's dad is
our new roommate. That's...

26:19.186 --> 26:21.231
Wait. Whoa. No, okay, wait.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.624
Only for
a couple of days.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.104
He got an early release,

26:24.147 --> 26:25.496
and he's trying to...

26:25.540 --> 26:26.933
make a better life
for himself.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.108
Allegedly. Yeah.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.457
Hopefully.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.851
Wait, he's living with you now?
Today?

26:31.894 --> 26:33.548
Yeah.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.897
Why didn't you ask him
to dinner?

26:34.941 --> 26:38.422
Well, um, he had to
look for an apartment.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.903
But you did invite him?

26:40.947 --> 26:41.904
Yeah.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.427
Um...

26:46.343 --> 26:48.389
Yeah, so you...

26:48.432 --> 26:50.086
didn't want him here?

26:50.130 --> 26:52.088
Oh. I mean, it's not...

26:52.132 --> 26:53.568
that so much as...

26:53.612 --> 26:54.700
He's just out of prison,
so we thought

26:54.743 --> 26:56.136
that it might be awkward.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.659
For him or for us?

26:57.703 --> 26:59.661
Well, for both.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.447
Eddie, anyone in your family
is welcome at this table.

27:03.491 --> 27:04.579
Thank you.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.841
So you think that we really

27:05.885 --> 27:07.408
should have encouraged him
to come?

27:08.191 --> 27:11.064
No. It's just that
we'd always make room.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.892
What Dad's really trying
to say is that,

27:12.935 --> 27:15.851
even though it's nice
to have saints at the table,

27:15.895 --> 27:17.940
it's a lot more fun
to have sinners.

27:19.115 --> 27:21.074
You know,
they tell better stories.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.597
And way better jokes.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.164
There you go.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.389
Dad! We're home.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.869
We brought dessert.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.393
Armin?

27:36.437 --> 27:37.917
Dad.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.919
- I think he's gone.
- Like...

27:39.962 --> 27:41.094
left?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.270
He didn't leave a note?

27:44.532 --> 27:45.794
It's because
we didn't invite him to dinner.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.840
Did seem like his feelings
were pretty hurt.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.627
Well, now he's out there.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.890
He's all alone,
again, by himself.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.502
What is that?

27:59.329 --> 28:00.766
A spy cam?

28:00.809 --> 28:02.158
What do you want? I'm a cop.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.725
Let's see it. Come on.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.207
All right.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.338
Who's this guy?

28:08.382 --> 28:09.731
Wait, he said there was a...

28:09.775 --> 28:11.864
a drug dealer
at his halfway house.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.605
- A big lug.
- Fits that description.

28:14.649 --> 28:15.868
Mm-hmm.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.653
And...

28:18.697 --> 28:19.828
away they go.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.134
Wait. Right there.
Look. He's gripping

28:21.177 --> 28:23.484
my dad's arm and
he's forcing him out the door.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.138
Come on, you're seeing things.

28:26.574 --> 28:27.575
No.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.359
Actually, you're not.

28:38.629 --> 28:39.892
Uh...

28:39.935 --> 28:42.764
Sid and I have taken
a two-pronged approach

28:42.808 --> 28:44.418
to find our leaker.

28:44.461 --> 28:48.204
The burglary occurred within the
confines of the 4-6 precinct,

28:48.248 --> 28:51.077
so I've been, uh,
working my contacts there.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.427
- And I

28:53.470 --> 28:54.776
kind of reverse-engineered it

28:54.820 --> 28:57.039
and went out to the editors
at the outlets

28:57.083 --> 29:00.086
that received
the original 911 recording.

29:00.129 --> 29:03.219
Well, you can both
take your foot off the gas.

29:06.483 --> 29:09.182
I asked Abigail to look into it.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.141
The results of <i>my</i> investigation.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.234
I don't want that.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.586
And you don't want
to open those.

29:22.630 --> 29:23.718
We don't?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.894
No, you don't.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.855
I haven't seen the results.

29:29.898 --> 29:32.161
I don't want to know
the results.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.642
Because if I knew...

29:34.685 --> 29:38.037
I would be dutybound to act.

29:38.864 --> 29:41.692
So, you want me to can the guy?

29:41.736 --> 29:43.651
Or guys?

29:43.694 --> 29:45.131
Or girl?

29:45.914 --> 29:48.874
Then I would know who it was.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.919
They'd be missing.

29:51.877 --> 29:55.097
I'm a little in the dark here.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.013
I'm holding fire.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.147
Just this once.

30:01.190 --> 30:05.499
Because the boots on the ground
got a big kick out of it.

30:05.542 --> 30:09.720
A boost in morale at a time
where it is sorely needed.

30:11.113 --> 30:13.550
And I ain't about to throw
a wet blanket

30:13.594 --> 30:15.770
on a boost in cops' morale.

30:17.337 --> 30:20.775
Boss, that's leadership
they can't see

30:20.819 --> 30:22.864
but surely will feel.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.997
Thank you.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.869
But this isn't a frat house

30:27.913 --> 30:29.566
or a locker room.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.525
It is the NYPD,

30:31.568 --> 30:33.788
and we don't play pranks

30:33.832 --> 30:36.356
on the public
we're sworn to serve.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.499
So...

30:51.937 --> 30:54.113
Just this once.

31:06.777 --> 31:07.735
Hey.

31:07.778 --> 31:08.867
Oh!

31:08.910 --> 31:10.781
Stuff I promised you
on your case.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.261
Thank you.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.567
And this...

31:13.610 --> 31:15.003
to say I'm sorry.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.787
That is not necessary.

31:16.831 --> 31:17.963
Yes, it is.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.225
I overstepped badly.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.357
You have a big heart, Anthony.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.011
Yeah, and a big ego
that gets bruised

31:23.055 --> 31:24.752
when you don't believe me
on something.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.536
You're so damn smart

31:26.580 --> 31:27.973
and you're usually right.

31:28.016 --> 31:31.498
Well, don't go popping
any corks anytime soon.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.803
And why not?

31:32.847 --> 31:35.197
I officially opened
the Jade Jones case.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.634
I've already asked Detective
Ewbanks to get that gun

31:37.678 --> 31:39.201
over to the lab for analysis.

31:39.245 --> 31:42.944
And I need you to reinterview
all the participants.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.641
Girl got to you, too, huh?

31:44.685 --> 31:46.905
And your belief in her.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.086
This Angie was quite
the hoarder, huh?

31:54.129 --> 31:58.003
Maybe. Or maybe she was
just so afraid to go outside

31:58.046 --> 31:59.482
'cause she didn't want David
to find her

31:59.526 --> 32:00.396
that she just
hunkered down

32:00.440 --> 32:01.832
in here and...

32:01.876 --> 32:03.312
Maybe she's already dead.

32:03.356 --> 32:06.707
Come on. Can we keep
a little optimism, please?

32:06.750 --> 32:10.015
I mean, my sister had an
obsessive boyfriend in college.

32:10.058 --> 32:11.277
He didn't want to kill her.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.887
He just... was
obsessed with her.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.280
He wanted her back.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.151
Yeah, I had one of those.
He tried to strangle me.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.762
Luckily, I kicked him
in the nuts, changed his mind.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.852
Ah, well, hopefully Angie
kicked this guy in the nuts.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.332
'Cause I'd sure like to.

32:23.376 --> 32:26.553
I may have found her phone.

32:28.555 --> 32:29.860
Maria Baez.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.688
Yeah.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.168
Great.

32:33.212 --> 32:34.822
Thanks.

32:34.865 --> 32:38.173
Shaw's truck was found in the
bottom level of a parking garage

32:38.217 --> 32:40.001
in Battery Park City, but...

32:40.045 --> 32:41.350
there's no sign of them.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.569
Okay, listen to
this text from David.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.614
"I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

32:44.658 --> 32:47.139
"I know I went crazy.
I've changed.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.705
"Please just meet me.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.708
"We can even meet in that
little park that you love

32:51.752 --> 32:53.014
in Tribeca."

32:53.058 --> 32:54.668
Which is about
two minutes away

32:54.711 --> 32:55.843
from Battery Park.

32:55.886 --> 32:58.019
That sounds like
another long shot, Danny.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.716
Well, it's the only shot we got.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.241
Let's go.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.465
This lug's name is Barry Trask?

33:09.509 --> 33:11.511
Ran a coke ring
across the tristate.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.904
Went to prison
for extortion and assault.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.906
He still owns
this place.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.299
And you know all this how?

33:17.343 --> 33:19.345
I printed a still
from your spy cam,

33:19.388 --> 33:21.347
sent it
to Facial Recognition.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.262
And then Narcotics told me
Trask kept selling

33:23.305 --> 33:24.567
while he was locked up.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.613
He probably has millions
he needs laundered.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.441
That's right up
your dad's alley.

33:28.484 --> 33:31.922
No. No.
Not anymore.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.141
I hope.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.382
♪ My best

33:56.425 --> 33:57.513
♪ I put it on y'all

33:57.557 --> 33:58.601
♪ You know I got to do it

33:58.645 --> 34:00.168
♪ I'm the best candidate

34:00.212 --> 34:02.083
♪ Landslide,
thought you knew it ♪

34:02.127 --> 34:04.172
Look. See?

34:04.999 --> 34:06.261
See? He fought back.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.742
Yeah. Only question
is, who won?

34:27.021 --> 34:28.196
Trask,

34:28.240 --> 34:29.980
you don't got to do this.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.330
So you'll launder my money
for me?

34:31.373 --> 34:32.896
I told you...

34:32.940 --> 34:34.376
I'm out of that life.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.380
Nobody gets out of the life.

34:38.424 --> 34:39.425
I got to do this.

34:39.468 --> 34:40.382
I'm begging you.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.949
I'm just trying to go straight.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.125
Nobody goes straight, Janko.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.909
It's in our blood.

34:49.217 --> 34:50.436
Now get in the trunk.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.787
Get in the trunk.
Let's go, let's go.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.441
Get in there.
Now.

34:55.484 --> 34:56.920
Get up!

34:58.922 --> 35:00.402
Get in there.

35:00.446 --> 35:01.621
Get in the trunk.

35:01.664 --> 35:02.926
All the way
in there.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.537
Put your feet in, too.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.495
I...

35:06.539 --> 35:08.062
Police! Don't move!

35:24.644 --> 35:25.862
Eddie, how did you...

35:25.906 --> 35:27.212
Followed the trail
of blood, Dad.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.127
I'm an off-duty M.O.S.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.041
in the rank of sergeant.
I've been involved in a shooting

35:31.085 --> 35:32.608
at 438 South Tetley.

35:32.652 --> 35:35.133
I need a bus at this location
forthwith regarding...

35:35.176 --> 35:37.526
Are you... you okay?

35:38.962 --> 35:41.051
I think he broke my nose.

35:43.445 --> 35:44.533
Yeah.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.361
Let's get you cleaned up, okay?

35:55.153 --> 35:57.503
Hey. Easy.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.722
You've been so good so far.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.376
See?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.683
The universe wants
this to happen.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.380
Wants what
to happen?

36:08.427 --> 36:09.558
Is that...?

36:09.602 --> 36:10.559
It's the ring

36:10.603 --> 36:12.387
that you gave back to me.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.215
David... No, no. Shh, shh.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.304
Angie, you were so right

36:16.348 --> 36:18.393
to put all this
off months ago.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.439
And I should've been
more understanding.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.788
But we got
through that,

36:21.831 --> 36:24.834
and now is a new
beginning for us.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.359
So...

36:29.012 --> 36:30.144
Again...

36:32.190 --> 36:33.930
...will you marry me?

36:36.716 --> 36:37.717
Hey!

36:38.326 --> 36:39.414
Oh, my God!
Thank you!

36:41.329 --> 36:43.026
He has a knife!
- He has a knife!
- Hey!

36:44.071 --> 36:44.985
Drop it right now!

36:45.028 --> 36:46.552
No, she wants to be with me!

36:46.595 --> 36:47.727
She doesn't want to be with you.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.294
Drop the knife right now!

36:52.775 --> 36:54.429
Angie.

36:56.431 --> 36:57.954
I said drop it! Now!

37:21.804 --> 37:22.370
I can't believe

37:22.414 --> 37:24.372
you called.

37:24.416 --> 37:25.286
Thank you so,

37:25.330 --> 37:26.635
- so much for this.
- Actually,

37:26.679 --> 37:28.158
there's no reason
to thank us.

37:28.202 --> 37:31.901
We don't get cold-blooded
killers released from prison.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.163
- What?
- The bullet

37:33.207 --> 37:35.253
from the boy in Chinatown
was a match

37:35.296 --> 37:37.298
because you shot him
and then you tossed the gun.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.648
You still believe
that bitch who lied in court?

37:39.692 --> 37:41.824
Actually, I couldn't
reinterview her,

37:41.868 --> 37:43.739
'cause she was murdered
three years ago.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.828
A hit you ordered
from in here.

37:45.872 --> 37:46.829
Says who?

37:46.873 --> 37:48.353
Someone very close
to you.

37:49.571 --> 37:50.703
Your mother.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.922
Turns out
she had a warrant out

37:52.966 --> 37:54.750
and was very happy
to make a trade.

37:54.794 --> 37:59.712
Lenience in exchange for the
burner phone you had her hide.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.931
In other words,
you'll be going to trial

38:01.975 --> 38:05.457
again and getting
convicted again

38:05.500 --> 38:07.676
for yet another murder.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.811
You two are dead.

38:11.854 --> 38:12.986
Guard?

38:13.029 --> 38:15.423
My mom, too.
I'll make it happen,

38:15.467 --> 38:16.729
even from in here.

38:17.556 --> 38:18.513
You hear me?

38:18.557 --> 38:20.602
You are all dead!

38:20.646 --> 38:21.951
Let's go!

38:24.171 --> 38:26.695
- I don't belong in here!
- Let's go!

38:32.484 --> 38:34.355
You sure you got
everything, Dad?

38:34.399 --> 38:36.401
Toothbrush, clothes on my back.

38:36.444 --> 38:37.532
Check.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.055
Just make sure
you don't piss off Lena,

38:39.099 --> 38:40.796
or, believe me, you'll be
begging to get back in prison.

38:41.580 --> 38:45.366
I still can't believe your
mother agreed to take me in.

38:45.410 --> 38:48.021
She wants you to succeed.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.109
We all do.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.676
All of you?

38:51.677 --> 38:53.679
Manner of speech.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.249
Hey.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.601
Okay.

39:02.644 --> 39:03.863
I'm off.

39:03.906 --> 39:04.994
Hey.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.866
Mmm.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.085
Bye, Dad.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.394
Hey, I'll-I'll be in touch.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.441
Great.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.408
Hey.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.671
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry about
everything with your dad.

39:29.715 --> 39:30.933
Mm.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.761
Why don't you make it up to me?

39:33.762 --> 39:35.024
Yeah.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.785
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.615
Sorry, we're closed.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.401
Hey. It's been three weeks
since my last confession,

40:03.444 --> 40:04.967
and these are my sins.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.926
Hubris. Mendacity.

40:06.969 --> 40:09.407
Acting in contempt
of your Church, for starters.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.322
Well, I'm sorry, Your
Eminence, but Father McDougal

40:12.366 --> 40:15.195
is guilty of those sins as well.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.457
- Really, Frank?
- Yeah.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.981
Really.
Wearing a collar and cloth

40:19.025 --> 40:20.505
to promote anarchy.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.464
Lying about my department
and its ways and means.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.902
And so acting in contempt
of the Church.

40:26.946 --> 40:29.470
And I know you know, Kevin.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.431
He had it coming.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.954
No, I don't know that.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.782
Yeah, you do.

40:36.825 --> 40:40.220
Did you find the perps?

40:41.003 --> 40:42.483
They have been dealt with.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.702
Severely?

40:43.745 --> 40:45.268
Appropriately.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.271
Hmm.

40:48.315 --> 40:51.449
Am I permitted
to instruct my detail

40:51.492 --> 40:55.278
not to disclose
my future whereabouts to you?

40:55.322 --> 40:56.584
Yes, but it was not necessary.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.717
That was
an exceptional circumstance.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.807
And what are you doing back
in Father McDougal's church?

41:01.850 --> 41:04.984
I'm waiting for him to return
from a hospital visit

41:05.027 --> 41:08.901
so I can tell him he's
being transferred to Buffalo.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.513
Oh.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.822
Mike McDougal can be a pain.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.606
You think?

41:18.650 --> 41:21.522
Course, I still share
God's love for him.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.785
Oh. Of course. And...

41:23.829 --> 41:27.963
deep down, I chose to think
he had good intentions as well.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.359
A good cop needs street smarts.

41:32.402 --> 41:34.187
So does a good priest.

41:34.230 --> 41:37.625
But standing outside a police
station with a bullhorn,

41:37.669 --> 41:40.585
calling for the cancellation
of the cops...

41:40.628 --> 41:43.065
what-what do you think,
nothing's gonna happen?

41:43.892 --> 41:47.679
Probably a tactical error
in there somewhere.

41:48.549 --> 41:49.855
Well...

41:49.898 --> 41:52.205
and then expect me
to clean up his mess?

41:52.248 --> 41:53.728
Hmm.

42:00.474 --> 42:03.433
I miss personal responsibility.

42:06.088 --> 42:10.571
Well, I pray we're just going
through a temporary drought.
