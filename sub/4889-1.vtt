01:24.197 --> 01:25.994
Hello.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.297
- Hello.
- Man: I'm coming!

01:30.337 --> 01:33.272
I'm coming.

01:34.708 --> 01:36.437
Hi.

01:36.476 --> 01:38.910
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.

01:38.945 --> 01:42.540
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.

01:42.582 --> 01:44.413
Mockingbird Trail, right?

01:44.451 --> 01:45.975
That is right.

01:47.821 --> 01:51.587
I don't suppose you know how
to get out there.

01:51.625 --> 01:54.526
No, I don't.

01:57.197 --> 01:58.789
Well, listen up.

02:00.534 --> 02:02.866
It's a bit tricky.

02:02.903 --> 02:04.165
- Keys.
- Thank you.

02:06.039 --> 02:09.338
These arrows
will get you through town.

02:09.376 --> 02:11.401
Over here

02:11.445 --> 02:13.470
there are more
dirt roads and woods.

02:13.513 --> 02:15.674
Your cabin's a real beaut.

02:15.715 --> 02:18.240
But heck, there ain't another
for a good country mile.

02:18.285 --> 02:21.015
I am looking forward
to the peace and quiet.

02:21.054 --> 02:23.818
I'm actually a novelist
and I'm starting my next book here.

02:23.857 --> 02:26.758
If that's what you're aiming for.

02:26.793 --> 02:29.887
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.

03:29.155 --> 03:31.316
Howdy, ma'am.

03:42.969 --> 03:44.402
Excuse me.

03:44.437 --> 03:46.837
I didn't mean to frighten you.

03:46.873 --> 03:49.603
No, that is okay.

03:49.643 --> 03:52.441
You know what?
I am actually lost.

03:52.479 --> 03:53.946
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.

03:53.980 --> 03:56.278
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.

03:56.316 --> 03:57.943
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.

03:57.984 --> 03:59.645
It's about 10 miles back.

03:59.686 --> 04:02.746
It's gonna be
on your left-hand side.

04:02.789 --> 04:04.848
Gonna make a left
after a big red mailbox.

04:04.891 --> 04:07.121
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.960
You staying over in that cabin
on Mockingbird?

04:10.997 --> 04:14.831
- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!

04:18.605 --> 04:22.473
So you know you're running
a little hot.

04:22.509 --> 04:25.535
Maybe I should check up
under your hood for you.

04:29.583 --> 04:32.108
How's that line
working for you?

04:32.152 --> 04:35.212
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?

04:43.463 --> 04:45.055
- I got that.
- No, I got it.

04:45.098 --> 04:46.656
No, I got it.

04:46.700 --> 04:47.997
Oh shit.

04:50.537 --> 04:52.505
I'm sorry, my bad.

04:52.539 --> 04:55.508
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.

04:55.542 --> 04:57.407
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

04:57.444 --> 05:00.311
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.

05:00.347 --> 05:03.077
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.

05:03.116 --> 05:05.676
- Okay.
- All right?

05:05.719 --> 05:08.187
Keep the change.

05:19.165 --> 05:21.497
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.

05:21.534 --> 05:23.502
Bye-bye.

08:09.936 --> 08:11.164
Woman:
How's the writing coming?

08:11.204 --> 08:13.195
You kidding me?

08:13.239 --> 08:15.173
I should have come out here
on my first book.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.039
You gonna come back
for Hertz's party?

08:17.076 --> 08:20.375
Jen? Did I lose you?

08:20.413 --> 08:22.381
Oh, sorry.
Something just-

08:23.983 --> 08:26.213
Hey.

08:26.252 --> 08:29.085
- You still there?
- Barb, hold on a second.

08:41.601 --> 08:43.727
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.

09:46.599 --> 09:49.227
You've got to be kidding me.

09:52.605 --> 09:55.972
Way to go, Jennifer.

12:28.428 --> 12:30.419
Ugh.

12:33.599 --> 12:35.464
Ew!

12:47.146 --> 12:49.478
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.

12:49.515 --> 12:51.278
Man: Did you check the seal
on the flapper?

12:51.317 --> 12:52.784
I did that already.

12:52.819 --> 12:56.311
- You did?
- Yes.

12:56.355 --> 12:58.050
Look, I'm really in a spot here.

12:58.091 --> 13:00.491
- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.

13:00.526 --> 13:02.084
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:02.128 --> 13:04.289
- You'll be there?
- I'm not going anywhere.

13:04.330 --> 13:05.820
Man:
All right, I'll send someone.

13:11.404 --> 13:12.769
Aggh!

13:28.287 --> 13:30.983
So is this gonna
take much longer?

13:32.758 --> 13:34.589
Not much.

13:34.627 --> 13:37.687
What's wrong with it?

13:53.679 --> 13:55.510
Yes!

13:59.252 --> 14:01.447
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.

14:03.322 --> 14:06.485
Sorry. You saved me from having
to bathe in the lake.

14:06.526 --> 14:09.359
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.

14:09.395 --> 14:11.124
Wait, I didn't-

14:15.067 --> 14:16.830
Ground rule double.

14:16.869 --> 14:19.861
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.

14:19.906 --> 14:22.238
Fine, maybe a triple.

14:22.275 --> 14:25.711
But you gotta knock its guts clean out
its mouth if you wanna score a run.

14:25.745 --> 14:27.269
Man, would you turn
that shit off?

14:27.313 --> 14:29.213
You're gonna get us in trouble
with that human society.

14:31.350 --> 14:34.444
- It's humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.

14:34.487 --> 14:37.149
I told you, Andy,
this thing's gonna make me a fortune.

14:38.257 --> 14:41.283
So you two retards
gonna go fishing or what?

14:41.327 --> 14:44.228
Hey, speaking of retards...

14:44.263 --> 14:46.356
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!

14:48.768 --> 14:52.431
Well, Stanley,
got us all here now.

14:52.471 --> 14:56.032
What's the big show?

14:56.075 --> 14:58.134
The big show

14:58.177 --> 15:00.236
is this.

15:00.279 --> 15:04.147
What did you do this time,
film yourself lighting a fart?

15:05.551 --> 15:08.076
I don't know why I bother
with you dipshits.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.283
I got Matthew's girlfriend here
in a very private moment.

15:11.324 --> 15:13.189
Andy:
Girlfriend?

15:13.226 --> 15:16.662
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since
he was sucking on his mama's titties.

15:16.696 --> 15:20.132
He had that city girl all alone
and he didn't even try to nail her.

15:21.534 --> 15:23.263
What city girl?

15:23.302 --> 15:24.769
You know what girl.

15:24.804 --> 15:26.999
The one from the gas station
the other day.

15:27.039 --> 15:29.007
The one that had you
on your ass.

15:30.643 --> 15:33.111
She had Matt here fixing
her pipes.

15:33.145 --> 15:36.774
She even gave him a kiss
for servicing her.

15:36.816 --> 15:38.306
Bullshit.

15:38.351 --> 15:42.344
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.

15:42.388 --> 15:44.856
Hey, Matthew,

15:44.890 --> 15:46.118
don't you lie to me.

15:46.158 --> 15:49.355
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.

15:49.395 --> 15:52.558
Oh shit.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.565
Andy: Hey, that's some good
camerawork, man.

15:57.603 --> 16:00.538
You dirty dog, man.

16:00.573 --> 16:02.131
How the fuck did you get that?

16:02.174 --> 16:04.540
I've been working nights.

16:04.577 --> 16:05.976
She sure is something
to look at.

16:06.012 --> 16:08.412
Yeah yeah.

16:08.447 --> 16:11.541
And she likes me.

16:11.584 --> 16:13.017
Come on, Matthew.

16:13.052 --> 16:15.384
That girl wouldn't even
give Johnny the time of day.

16:15.421 --> 16:16.820
What?

16:16.856 --> 16:19.017
Shit.

16:19.058 --> 16:20.855
I can tame that ass
if I want to.

16:20.893 --> 16:23.828
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.

16:23.863 --> 16:25.922
Stuck-up city bitch.

16:25.965 --> 16:27.933
City bitch like that
is ungettable.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.765
Bullshit. I'll get it.

16:32.238 --> 16:33.762
Let me tell you something:

16:33.806 --> 16:36.536
I had that bitch
creaming her panties.

16:36.575 --> 16:39.373
Yeah, and she had you
shitting in yours.

16:41.314 --> 16:43.942
You don't think I can have that
anytime I want to?

16:43.983 --> 16:45.541
Hmm?

16:53.559 --> 16:56.027
Let me tell you something:

16:56.062 --> 16:57.859
Bitch like that,

16:57.897 --> 17:01.458
she come out here for one reason
and one reason only.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.095
Titties flopping in the window
like that for everyone to see.

17:05.137 --> 17:07.105
Come on, you know.

17:07.138 --> 17:09.130
No no.

17:09.175 --> 17:13.077
She's not like that, Johnny.

17:13.112 --> 17:17.048
They're all like that.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.848
Big city cock-teasing whore
is all she is.

17:20.886 --> 17:22.877
Fuckin' A.

17:25.023 --> 17:26.820
Shit, Matthew.

17:26.858 --> 17:29.521
You wouldn't know what to do with
a piece of ass like that if you got it.

17:29.562 --> 17:31.621
No shit.

17:33.332 --> 17:35.562
But you're lucky

17:35.601 --> 17:37.228
'cause I'm your friend.

17:39.338 --> 17:41.329
I'll show you the way.

19:41.327 --> 19:43.318
Hello.

21:57.863 --> 22:00.297
Nice shot, huh?

22:00.332 --> 22:01.663
Evening.

22:01.700 --> 22:05.500
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!

22:05.537 --> 22:07.027
Well now.

22:07.072 --> 22:08.733
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?

22:08.774 --> 22:11.174
Smile real pretty
for the camera, girl.

22:13.612 --> 22:15.136
Mm-mm-mm.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.742
You all better get out
of here right now.

22:21.787 --> 22:23.414
I called the cops.

22:23.455 --> 22:26.253
Oh, she called the cops.

22:28.427 --> 22:31.089
You called the police
or you will call the police?

22:31.130 --> 22:34.725
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.

22:34.767 --> 22:36.701
What phone did you
do that with?

22:36.735 --> 22:39.568
Matthew told us you dropped
yours in the drain.

22:39.605 --> 22:41.470
Bloop!

22:43.342 --> 22:45.776
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?

22:45.811 --> 22:49.372
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!

22:49.415 --> 22:52.145
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.

22:52.184 --> 22:53.913
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.

22:53.952 --> 22:56.079
It's all right.
Come on now.

22:56.121 --> 22:59.022
Come on, boy.
Come here.

23:02.294 --> 23:04.319
Matthew here says

23:04.363 --> 23:06.354
that you didn't pay him
for fixing your sink.

23:06.398 --> 23:07.922
That's not true.

23:07.966 --> 23:11.163
He ran out.

23:11.203 --> 23:12.795
I'll take care of it.

23:12.838 --> 23:14.567
Andy:
He's shy, huh?

23:14.606 --> 23:18.508
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.

23:18.544 --> 23:20.637
Hold up, wait a minute.

23:26.318 --> 23:28.912
Let's not worry
about any of that right now.

23:30.956 --> 23:32.924
What's a pretty little thing like you

23:32.958 --> 23:35.324
doing out here all alone?

23:35.360 --> 23:37.851
I'm writing.

23:37.896 --> 23:40.091
I'm a writer.

23:40.132 --> 23:42.930
She's a writer.

23:42.968 --> 23:44.833
My boyfriend will be here soon.

23:44.870 --> 23:47.100
He's coming up
to the cabin.

23:47.139 --> 23:49.437
Is that right?

23:49.475 --> 23:51.170
Oh!

23:51.210 --> 23:52.768
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

23:52.811 --> 23:55.279
Boys, now we better
blow on out of here.

23:55.314 --> 23:57.441
We don't wanna interrupt
your date night.

23:57.483 --> 24:01.078
Date night!

24:01.120 --> 24:03.111
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart:

24:03.155 --> 24:06.716
There ain't no man
in his right mind

24:06.759 --> 24:09.091
that leaves a pretty little thing

24:09.128 --> 24:11.926
like you out here

24:11.964 --> 24:13.488
all alone.

24:15.934 --> 24:17.834
He's coming.

24:17.870 --> 24:19.497
Night's almost over.

24:26.712 --> 24:28.703
Oh wow.

24:36.955 --> 24:39.685
Johnny:
Come here.

24:39.725 --> 24:41.556
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.

24:45.664 --> 24:48.462
Come here, pretty little thing.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.525
Come here,
have a drink with me.

24:50.569 --> 24:52.503
No.

24:52.538 --> 24:54.802
Oh, there you go.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.535
I don't want to.

24:56.575 --> 25:00.443
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?

25:00.479 --> 25:02.743
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

25:02.781 --> 25:04.874
Please, I just don't want to
have a drink.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.283
What is this shit right here?

25:07.319 --> 25:09.651
'Cause that's already
been opened.

25:09.688 --> 25:12.657
Well shit, boys.
You were right.

25:12.691 --> 25:14.784
She's too good
to have a drink with us.

25:14.827 --> 25:16.294
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

25:16.328 --> 25:18.319
What are we to you?

25:18.363 --> 25:20.888
A bunch of dirt?

25:20.933 --> 25:22.730
I didn't say that.

25:22.768 --> 25:24.736
Fuckin' A,
this bitch is a writer.

25:24.770 --> 25:28.228
"No one wants a phone call

25:28.273 --> 25:29.740
at 2:00 in the morning.

25:29.775 --> 25:31.709
When you're 15,
it's a prank call.

25:31.743 --> 25:34.803
When you're 21,
it's a drunk boyfriend call.

25:34.847 --> 25:36.872
But after 25,

25:36.915 --> 25:39.543
it's usually really bad news.

25:39.585 --> 25:42.918
That's how I found out
my father died. "

25:42.955 --> 25:45.753
Whose daddy died?

25:47.192 --> 25:50.787
Can't you all
just please leave me alone?

25:50.829 --> 25:53.127
Johnny: No!

25:54.666 --> 25:56.600
Just tell me what you want.

25:58.804 --> 26:02.433
What do you want?
I offered you my money.

26:02.474 --> 26:04.965
Mm-hmm.

26:05.010 --> 26:07.501
Whoa!

26:15.954 --> 26:18.616
Here. Here.

26:20.125 --> 26:22.923
Fine. I'll have a drink.

26:22.961 --> 26:24.826
Then you have to leave.

26:24.863 --> 26:27.627
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.

26:32.004 --> 26:33.335
That ain't shit.

26:33.372 --> 26:36.034
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.

26:36.074 --> 26:39.271
Now see, I-

26:39.311 --> 26:42.508
I know you can
do better than that.

26:42.547 --> 26:44.538
I'm sure that when you're
out there in the city

26:44.583 --> 26:47.814
with all your hoity-toity
rich friends,

26:47.853 --> 26:49.718
I bet you can throw 'em back
with the best of 'em.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.347
Now can't you?

26:51.390 --> 26:53.654
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!

26:59.531 --> 27:03.490
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!

27:03.535 --> 27:06.003
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.

27:06.038 --> 27:09.599
All right, shit.

27:09.641 --> 27:11.905
See, that's not
so bad now, is it?

27:13.478 --> 27:17.676
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.

27:17.716 --> 27:20.844
But we're even now, right?

27:20.886 --> 27:24.652
Okay?
Just please leave.

27:24.690 --> 27:27.056
Please leave.

27:27.092 --> 27:30.186
Well, that's just not
what this is about no more.

27:34.032 --> 27:37.001
What is it about?

27:40.472 --> 27:43.032
I wanna see your teeth.

27:46.078 --> 27:48.069
What?

27:49.915 --> 27:51.906
You heard me,

27:51.950 --> 27:54.418
pretty little show horse.

27:54.453 --> 27:56.353
I want

27:56.388 --> 27:58.754
to see

27:58.790 --> 28:00.417
your teeth.

28:02.794 --> 28:04.694
That-

28:04.730 --> 28:06.960
I don't want to- no.

28:14.339 --> 28:17.570
Now you're gonna show
them teeth.

28:17.609 --> 28:20.203
You have beautiful teeth.

28:20.245 --> 28:23.408
There.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.452
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.

28:34.059 --> 28:37.495
Let's see more.

28:37.529 --> 28:39.463
Put your fingers

28:39.498 --> 28:43.264
on the inside of your mouth
right there.

28:43.301 --> 28:46.634
Now take the other two,
stick 'em on the other side.

28:46.671 --> 28:48.798
There you go.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.273
Now pull.

28:50.308 --> 28:53.744
Okay, please, I'm begging you,
just go.

28:53.779 --> 28:55.508
No.

29:00.685 --> 29:01.845
Again.

29:05.157 --> 29:07.591
Come here.
There it is.

29:07.626 --> 29:09.992
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!

29:10.028 --> 29:13.156
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.

29:13.198 --> 29:17.032
Shh!

29:17.069 --> 29:19.299
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.

29:22.107 --> 29:25.508
You know why I know you
ain't got no boyfriend?

29:25.544 --> 29:28.274
You know why?

29:28.313 --> 29:32.113
'Cause all them
city boys are faggots.

29:32.150 --> 29:33.549
Fuckin' A.

29:42.928 --> 29:46.887
Since you ain't got
no boyfriend,

29:46.932 --> 29:49.230
well, shit, I figured that...

29:54.072 --> 29:56.506
this would be
your man tonight.

29:56.541 --> 29:59.339
Yeah.

29:59.377 --> 30:02.244
No?
Come here.

30:05.550 --> 30:07.711
Come on,
give him a little kiss.

30:07.752 --> 30:11.210
Give him a little kiss,
come on.

30:11.256 --> 30:13.383
Give him a little kiss here.

30:13.425 --> 30:15.393
Give him
a little kiss here. Kiss him.

30:15.427 --> 30:17.588
Oh shit, come on now.

30:17.629 --> 30:20.564
Come on now. I ain't talking about no
fucking peck like you gave Matthew.

30:20.599 --> 30:23.534
I want you to give him
a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.

30:23.568 --> 30:26.298
Get up on your knees.

30:29.241 --> 30:32.039
If I don't like
your enthusiasm,

30:32.077 --> 30:34.739
I may come bad.

30:40.285 --> 30:42.344
Open up.
Open up.

30:42.387 --> 30:44.218
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

30:44.256 --> 30:46.121
All right, all right.

30:46.158 --> 30:49.559
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.

30:49.594 --> 30:51.084
Just like it's your
first time again.

30:51.129 --> 30:54.030
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.

30:54.065 --> 30:55.532
All right, all right.

30:55.567 --> 30:58.092
Shit!

30:59.771 --> 31:03.537
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.

31:03.575 --> 31:06.271
I d-don't want to.

31:06.311 --> 31:07.710
I don't.

31:07.746 --> 31:11.113
What?
What the fuck did you say?

31:11.149 --> 31:14.641
What the hell you mean
you d-d-don't want to?

31:14.686 --> 31:17.314
I don't want to, Johnny.

31:17.355 --> 31:19.949
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.

31:19.991 --> 31:21.618
Listen to me.

31:21.660 --> 31:23.594
Fuck that, man.

31:23.628 --> 31:25.459
I ain't fucking waiting.

31:25.497 --> 31:26.828
Aw shit!

31:26.865 --> 31:29.265
Matthew:
She-she likes me.

31:29.301 --> 31:30.461
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?

31:30.502 --> 31:32.299
Go ahead.

31:32.337 --> 31:35.898
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.

31:35.941 --> 31:38.307
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.

31:38.343 --> 31:39.970
Go prove it to me.

31:40.011 --> 31:42.138
Uh-huh.

31:44.015 --> 31:46.609
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!

31:48.687 --> 31:51.247
Johnny:
Come on, boys!

32:24.155 --> 32:25.850
Whoa there.

32:25.890 --> 32:28.017
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.

32:30.829 --> 32:33.957
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.990
I was assaulted.

32:36.034 --> 32:37.797
He came into my cabin
and he had a gun.

32:37.836 --> 32:40.066
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.

32:40.105 --> 32:41.663
It was in my mouth.

32:41.706 --> 32:43.435
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.

32:43.475 --> 32:44.965
I know this one.

32:45.010 --> 32:47.137
She rented the place
down on Mockingbird Trail.

32:47.178 --> 32:50.511
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.

32:50.548 --> 32:52.812
I'm a sheriff.

32:52.851 --> 32:54.751
You're safe.

32:54.786 --> 32:57.721
Now tell me what happened.

32:57.756 --> 32:59.815
These four men-

32:59.858 --> 33:02.349
there were four men
and they broke into my cabin.

33:02.394 --> 33:04.828
And they had a gun
and they assaulted me.

33:04.863 --> 33:07.730
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?

33:07.766 --> 33:10.701
Yes, I'd seen them.

33:10.735 --> 33:12.862
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station

33:12.904 --> 33:15.065
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.

33:15.106 --> 33:17.904
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.

33:17.942 --> 33:20.274
Sounds like them boys have
been up to no good again.

33:20.312 --> 33:22.780
All right, Earl,
you head on back.

33:22.814 --> 33:25.908
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.

33:25.950 --> 33:27.645
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head
on over to the cabin

33:27.686 --> 33:30.450
and straighten things out.

33:58.283 --> 34:01.081
Miller!

34:01.119 --> 34:03.144
Miller, this is the sheriff.

34:03.188 --> 34:06.351
You and your boys are still here,
you come on out right now.

34:22.507 --> 34:26.204
Miller, if you're up there,
you'll be leaving by the window.

34:29.214 --> 34:32.012
Ma'am, stay here.

35:06.384 --> 35:08.545
You here alone?

35:08.586 --> 35:10.816
Yes.

35:18.029 --> 35:19.997
With all this?

35:20.031 --> 35:22.329
I didn't plan on drinking it all
right away.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.961
I was gonna be here
for a couple months.

35:25.003 --> 35:27.130
You drink some this evening?

35:27.172 --> 35:28.639
Yes.

35:48.092 --> 35:51.391
One of them went upstairs
and he went through everything.

36:03.107 --> 36:04.699
They do this too?

36:04.742 --> 36:07.336
Please, I really don't care
about any of that.

36:08.980 --> 36:10.948
How long you been here?

36:10.982 --> 36:13.041
Just a couple days.

36:14.786 --> 36:17.414
Anything strange happen
before this?

36:17.455 --> 36:21.414
You have a run-in
with any of these guys?

36:21.459 --> 36:23.484
No, not really.

36:23.528 --> 36:26.361
Just stopped for gas
and directions.

36:31.069 --> 36:33.970
Ma'am, is this your
marijuana cigarette?

36:34.005 --> 36:37.600
Um, no.

36:37.642 --> 36:40.270
One of the boys
must have left it.

36:42.046 --> 36:45.140
You mean to tell me one
of them guys is wearing lipstick?

36:47.585 --> 36:49.917
This ain't the big city.

36:49.954 --> 36:52.479
Please, I may have smoked a joint,

36:52.524 --> 36:54.617
but that doesn't mean
that I made any of this up.

36:56.194 --> 36:58.526
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.

36:58.563 --> 37:01.828
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?

37:01.866 --> 37:04.699
What could you possibly
need backup for? I'm the victim.

37:04.736 --> 37:07.296
Ma'am, you've been drinking,

37:07.338 --> 37:09.203
smoking marijuana cigarettes.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.971
You got enough booze in here to put
the whole town three sheets to the wind.

37:13.011 --> 37:16.208
You're running around in your sleeping
garments at the crack of dawn.

37:16.247 --> 37:17.714
You gotta see this
from my point of view.

37:17.749 --> 37:21.241
What? They came in here
and they assaulted me.

37:21.286 --> 37:22.810
You have to believe me.

37:22.854 --> 37:25.220
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to get to the bottom of this.

37:25.256 --> 37:26.723
You're making serious accusations

37:26.758 --> 37:29.352
about boys I've known
since they was kids.

37:29.394 --> 37:32.830
And you haven't been
altogether truthful now, have you?

37:35.900 --> 37:38.528
Now please,
step up against the wall.

37:50.214 --> 37:53.012
Shoulder width apart.

38:04.829 --> 38:07.491
Ma'am, please.

38:07.532 --> 38:09.898
Look right ahead.

38:29.787 --> 38:32.381
Now...

38:32.423 --> 38:35.824
I want the whole story.

38:35.860 --> 38:37.760
You tell me the whole thing.

38:40.598 --> 38:42.896
You start by telling me
what those boys did.

38:42.934 --> 38:45.425
Tell the sheriff the truth,
show horse.

38:49.741 --> 38:53.233
Better yet,
why don't you show him?

38:58.216 --> 39:00.776
Show him how that pretty little mouth
of yours couldn't get enough

39:00.818 --> 39:03.446
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?

39:22.840 --> 39:24.432
They do this?

39:25.743 --> 39:28.610
Nice little tits.

39:39.824 --> 39:42.054
I asked you a question.

39:45.797 --> 39:48.163
Please.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.967
Johnny: You show the sheriff
your teeth there, show horse.

39:53.004 --> 39:54.437
Come on.

39:56.140 --> 39:58.768
- Come on, move.
- Andy: Get!

39:58.810 --> 40:00.175
Move!

40:08.920 --> 40:10.911
Now whinny.

40:12.290 --> 40:14.485
I said whinny!

40:14.525 --> 40:17.323
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!

40:17.361 --> 40:20.660
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!

40:22.700 --> 40:25.464
Huh. Huh.

40:29.140 --> 40:32.803
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.

40:32.844 --> 40:35.005
Johnny:
Keep whinnying, show horse.

40:35.046 --> 40:36.946
Stanley:
Here we go.

40:36.981 --> 40:38.972
Get on your knees.

40:41.552 --> 40:43.543
Keep whinnying!

40:43.588 --> 40:45.681
Oh-ho-ho!

40:49.994 --> 40:53.020
You oughta tame
that little mare of yours.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.395
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.

40:57.435 --> 40:59.733
On your feet or you're not
gonna get your sugar cube.

40:59.771 --> 41:01.534
Matthew,
get your clothes off, boy.

41:01.572 --> 41:02.834
We're gonna get
your cherry popped.

41:02.874 --> 41:04.501
Huh-uh.

41:04.542 --> 41:06.510
Matthew, I ain't
asking you a question.

41:07.545 --> 41:10.480
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.

41:10.515 --> 41:14.315
You wanna talk the talk,
you better walk the walk.

41:14.352 --> 41:16.047
I'm walking.

41:16.087 --> 41:17.918
- Jennifer: Stop, stop.
- Virgin.

41:17.955 --> 41:19.320
Please stop.

41:24.562 --> 41:27.998
You get your clothes off
or I'm gonna slice her

41:28.032 --> 41:31.160
from the chin

41:31.202 --> 41:33.670
- to cunt.
- Oh!

41:33.704 --> 41:36.366
Oh yeah!

41:41.279 --> 41:43.270
- Johnny: There's Matthew.
- Stanley: Now he gets it.

41:43.314 --> 41:45.339
Johnny:
Pants off, boy.

41:45.383 --> 41:48.546
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.

41:51.422 --> 41:54.050
Well, it's not totally his fault.

41:54.091 --> 41:57.424
She ain't done much to get
his motor running now, has she?

41:57.461 --> 41:59.895
Dance.

42:01.399 --> 42:03.026
Dance.

42:03.067 --> 42:04.295
Come on.

42:04.335 --> 42:07.236
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!

42:07.271 --> 42:11.139
Johnny: Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!

42:11.175 --> 42:14.702
Prance for us now. Come on,
like you do when you wanna get laid.

42:14.745 --> 42:16.872
Whoo! Come on!

42:16.914 --> 42:19.382
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.

42:19.417 --> 42:21.476
You dance like that
in them city clubs?

42:21.519 --> 42:24.886
- Ho!
- Come on now!

42:24.922 --> 42:26.719
You watching this, boy?

42:28.960 --> 42:30.791
Johnny: What?

42:30.828 --> 42:33.922
Okay, I'll- I'll- I'll-
I'll do it.

42:33.965 --> 42:36.331
Okay? Okay.

42:36.367 --> 42:38.767
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah!

42:38.803 --> 42:42.534
Okay, here we go.
Get up, get up.

42:42.573 --> 42:45.804
This is for you, Matthew.
This is for you, boy.

42:45.843 --> 42:47.708
Oh yeah!
Oh shit!

42:47.745 --> 42:49.610
Get her up here.
Shut her up.

42:52.817 --> 42:54.808
No! No! No!

42:54.852 --> 42:57.286
Hold her legs!

42:57.321 --> 42:58.652
Oh my God.

42:58.689 --> 43:01.157
I'll bash your fucking
face in, bitch.

43:01.192 --> 43:04.025
- Andy: Shut up.
- No no no!

43:04.061 --> 43:06.495
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.

43:06.530 --> 43:08.589
- God damn it.
- Okay.

43:10.468 --> 43:13.232
- Johnny: Here. Here.
- Storch: Get her panties off.

43:13.271 --> 43:15.466
- I'll rip 'em off.
- No!

43:19.744 --> 43:22.008
Yeah, get her.

43:22.046 --> 43:24.378
- Johnny: Damn it, hold her still.
- Come on, retard.

43:24.415 --> 43:26.713
- No! No!
- Hold her down!

43:26.751 --> 43:29.311
- Stick your pee-pee in her.
- Okay!

43:29.353 --> 43:31.617
Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.

43:31.656 --> 43:34.318
Johnny: Yeah!

43:36.093 --> 43:37.617
Storch:
Get in there!

43:37.662 --> 43:40.187
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
- Jennifer: Oh no!

43:40.231 --> 43:43.359
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.

43:44.535 --> 43:47.197
Johnny: Feels good, don't it, Matthew,
pumping away on her? Get her legs.

43:47.238 --> 43:50.332
Storch: Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!

43:50.374 --> 43:53.002
Deep. Get in deep.
Get in deep.

43:53.044 --> 43:56.138
Deep deep deep deep!

43:56.180 --> 43:58.512
- Deep!
- Johnny: Yeah, Matthew.

43:58.549 --> 44:01.575
Get over here.

44:01.619 --> 44:04.645
Hey, put that thing down
and get over here.

44:04.689 --> 44:08.523
- Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

44:08.559 --> 44:10.083
Storch:
Gag her!

44:10.127 --> 44:12.595
Johnny: Shut her up!

44:12.630 --> 44:15.827
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!

44:18.469 --> 44:21.768
Keep her quiet now!

44:21.806 --> 44:23.967
Hello, angel.

44:24.008 --> 44:25.908
Daddy's on a call.

44:25.943 --> 44:27.934
Girl:
Daddy, it's Sunday.

44:27.979 --> 44:29.844
You always make breakfast
before church.

44:29.880 --> 44:31.871
I know, I know, sweetheart.

44:31.916 --> 44:34.680
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.

44:34.719 --> 44:36.744
Okay.
Bye, Daddy.

44:40.992 --> 44:43.222
Johnny: Yeah, Matthew!
Yeah, Matthew!

44:43.260 --> 44:45.820
He fill her up yet?

44:47.732 --> 44:50.098
Johnny: Damn it. Oh shit!

44:51.268 --> 44:54.032
You're the shit, Matthew.

44:54.071 --> 44:56.369
You're getting your ass beat
by a woman.

44:58.409 --> 45:01.401
Johnny: Matthew,
you better control that bitch.

45:01.445 --> 45:03.413
Hold her down. Yeah.

45:03.447 --> 45:04.914
Yeah!

45:33.144 --> 45:35.305
Yeah, boy.
Over there.

45:35.346 --> 45:36.813
Over there.

45:44.021 --> 45:46.888
Ain't that romantic?

45:46.924 --> 45:48.915
You clean that shit up.

45:48.959 --> 45:50.426
Make her do it.

45:50.461 --> 45:52.986
Andy:
You heard him. Clean it up.

45:53.030 --> 45:56.522
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?

45:56.567 --> 45:58.535
Stanley:
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.

46:01.305 --> 46:03.068
You can thank me later.

46:03.107 --> 46:06.304
Andy: You calm down, boy.

46:06.343 --> 46:08.334
You did all right, Matthew.

47:15.246 --> 47:17.680
Jennifer: No no.

47:17.715 --> 47:19.580
Please.

47:24.355 --> 47:25.617
No.

47:28.492 --> 47:30.585
No no.

47:37.067 --> 47:40.468
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.

47:40.504 --> 47:43.405
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.432
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?

47:46.477 --> 47:48.843
Why don't you have a drink?

47:55.719 --> 47:58.483
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.

47:58.522 --> 48:01.320
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.

48:07.164 --> 48:10.600
All right, boys,

48:10.634 --> 48:12.158
that filly's got a few more races
to run.

48:17.374 --> 48:19.342
You like that, girl?

48:19.376 --> 48:22.834
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.

48:24.048 --> 48:26.778
You got some fight
left in you, Miss Hills.

48:26.817 --> 48:28.978
I like things rough.

48:29.019 --> 48:32.546
Please. Please.

48:34.692 --> 48:37.160
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.

48:37.194 --> 48:38.991
Please.

48:40.231 --> 48:42.358
I'm sore.

48:46.403 --> 48:47.665
Don't worry now, sweetheart.

48:50.708 --> 48:52.676
I'm an ass man.

49:41.959 --> 49:45.622
No teeth, show horse.

49:45.663 --> 49:47.654
No teeth.

49:51.702 --> 49:53.897
Whoo!

50:07.584 --> 50:10.178
Andy:
God damn, Stanley.

50:10.220 --> 50:12.848
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.

50:12.890 --> 50:14.380
That bitch was too tight.

50:14.425 --> 50:17.792
Don't you know you're supposed
to wait for the lady?

50:17.828 --> 50:20.729
Stanley:
Shit, man, like she cares.

50:20.764 --> 50:22.664
She's laying there
like a dead fish.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.635
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.

50:25.669 --> 50:28.433
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna

50:28.472 --> 50:30.736
be the pussy today, huh?

50:30.774 --> 50:33.572
Johnny: Don't know what
you're bragging about, Andy.

50:33.610 --> 50:36.408
Clocked you
just over two minutes.

50:36.447 --> 50:38.176
Andy:
It's been a while, man.

50:38.215 --> 50:39.876
I'm out of practice.

50:39.917 --> 50:43.045
It's been, I don't know,
maybe 10 years.

50:44.254 --> 50:45.448
Where you going?

50:45.489 --> 50:48.049
God damn,
she's got some fight in her.

52:18.182 --> 52:19.809
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.

52:19.850 --> 52:23.081
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?

52:39.570 --> 52:43.563
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Miss Hills.

52:56.487 --> 52:58.512
Johnny: Shit!

53:02.659 --> 53:05.457
Johnny:
Where is she?

53:07.297 --> 53:10.323
Hell, she's gotta
come up for air sometime.

53:10.367 --> 53:12.562
Shit.

53:23.280 --> 53:27.148
Stanley: Gators must have
got her by now. Right, Sheriff?

53:32.523 --> 53:35.185
Listen up.

53:35.225 --> 53:38.251
Creek ends about six miles
downstream in Watson.

53:38.295 --> 53:41.287
Between here and there,
we're gonna find her.

53:41.331 --> 53:44.027
We split up.
We check the banks,

53:44.067 --> 53:45.500
in the timber, under rocks.

53:45.536 --> 53:48.198
Hell, you see a hole big enough
for her, I want you in there.

53:48.238 --> 53:51.503
And do not stop till y'all
find me a dead city whore.

54:08.825 --> 54:10.019
Nothing.

54:13.964 --> 54:15.989
Not a goddamn thing.

54:30.247 --> 54:32.511
Now what?

54:32.549 --> 54:35.541
Her body will show up one way
or another.

54:38.055 --> 54:40.387
Every day we're
gonna check the ravine,

54:40.424 --> 54:43.791
from the bridge
straight down through here and back.

54:43.827 --> 54:45.727
Two shifts a day
till we find something.

54:45.762 --> 54:47.320
For how long?

54:49.366 --> 54:52.494
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?

54:55.739 --> 54:58.367
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.

54:58.408 --> 55:01.309
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?

55:01.345 --> 55:04.007
Yes sir.

55:04.047 --> 55:05.912
You get her wheels
down the shop.

55:05.949 --> 55:08.213
Strip it down to its
last goddamn nut.

55:08.251 --> 55:10.082
That's gonna take two weeks.

55:14.791 --> 55:17.123
All right, Sheriff, yeah.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.321
I'll have Andy torch it out

55:19.363 --> 55:21.490
and I'll rub the numbers out.

55:29.306 --> 55:31.137
Asshole!

55:31.174 --> 55:34.405
The fuck you saving that for,
you moron?

55:34.444 --> 55:36.742
It's fucking evidence!

55:38.915 --> 55:41.713
I shit you not!

55:57.801 --> 56:00.395
I need you all on point
for this.

56:00.437 --> 56:03.304
And I mean goddamn
fucking point.

56:03.340 --> 56:06.070
We clear?

56:08.412 --> 56:10.277
Now pony up.

56:10.313 --> 56:12.781
We got shit to do.

56:12.816 --> 56:15.444
Burn that effing tape.

56:20.290 --> 56:22.417
Andy:
Well, that's all of it,

56:22.459 --> 56:25.087
right down
to her little titty sling.

56:34.337 --> 56:38.068
Man, this fire's
making me hungry.

56:38.108 --> 56:40.076
Well, there's a headline.

56:40.110 --> 56:42.578
We gotta finish this shit.

56:42.612 --> 56:45.137
We gotta get that car
in the garage.

56:45.182 --> 56:48.151
Then you can stuff your face
till you puke.

56:51.521 --> 56:53.512
Where the hell's Matthew at?

56:53.557 --> 56:56.788
He ain't one
to stay behind.

56:56.827 --> 57:00.786
He was looking around the water like
some crazed dog after a bone, man.

57:00.831 --> 57:03.698
You keep an eye on him.

57:03.734 --> 57:05.793
We gotta make sure
he keeps it together, you hear me?

57:07.404 --> 57:09.395
Just at least until
this shit's over.

57:48.245 --> 57:50.076
Gone all day,
I got nervous.

57:50.113 --> 57:52.980
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.

57:53.016 --> 57:56.417
The mess they got on Highway 1
took forever.

57:56.453 --> 57:57.920
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?

57:57.954 --> 57:59.421
Daddy.

57:59.456 --> 58:01.117
Got anything on the stove?

58:01.158 --> 58:04.321
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.

58:04.361 --> 58:06.352
Proud of what?

58:10.267 --> 58:12.701
I was accepted
to the honors program, Daddy.

58:14.304 --> 58:16.272
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.

58:16.306 --> 58:18.797
I expect nothing less
from my angel.

58:18.842 --> 58:21.606
Mommy and I are
proud of you.

58:23.880 --> 58:26.348
I'm gonna shower up.

58:51.374 --> 58:54.502
Every time I come in here
this place gets worse.

58:54.544 --> 58:56.774
Yeah,
and business keeps getting

58:56.813 --> 58:58.906
better and better.

59:08.391 --> 59:10.518
Mockingbird Trail.

59:10.560 --> 59:11.925
Miss Hills.

59:11.962 --> 59:14.157
She left?

59:14.197 --> 59:16.392
She did indeed.

59:16.433 --> 59:19.231
I couldn't make head
nor tail of it.

59:19.269 --> 59:22.204
I found empty cases of booze,

59:22.239 --> 59:24.332
marijuana cigarettes.

59:24.374 --> 59:25.568
Crazy wild one.

59:25.609 --> 59:27.770
She'd have made
a preacher cuss.

59:27.811 --> 59:30.803
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?

59:30.847 --> 59:33.281
No refund policy.

59:33.316 --> 59:35.944
Christmas come early.

59:35.986 --> 59:37.817
Enjoy it.

59:39.022 --> 59:41.991
Speaking of early,
next month's quail season.

59:42.025 --> 59:43.652
I don't know about you,

59:43.693 --> 59:46.856
but I'm getting tired
of shooting squirrels.

59:46.897 --> 59:49.957
Me too.

01:00:22.599 --> 01:00:25.124
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.

01:00:25.168 --> 01:00:28.331
Did you just come here
to see me?

01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:30.339
Happy hour, boys.

01:00:30.373 --> 01:00:33.706
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.

01:00:39.449 --> 01:00:41.644
I just want all this bullshit
to be over.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:20.881
No!

01:01:54.691 --> 01:01:56.625
Woman: He's the big black guy
in the red drawstring.

01:01:56.659 --> 01:01:58.559
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.

01:01:58.595 --> 01:02:00.256
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.960
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.

01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:10.404
It's Earl.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.101
- Earl.
- Yeah.

01:02:12.142 --> 01:02:15.111
This woman leaves a message
on the machine.

01:02:15.145 --> 01:02:16.578
Barbara something or other.

01:02:16.613 --> 01:02:18.308
Yeah, so?

01:02:18.348 --> 01:02:21.078
She was asking
about that Miss Hills.

01:02:21.117 --> 01:02:23.847
Says no one's seen her
in over a month.

01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:26.879
Ain't that about the time
she split?

01:02:26.923 --> 01:02:29.187
Yeah.

01:02:29.225 --> 01:02:31.284
Yeah, and you know the story.

01:02:31.327 --> 01:02:34.194
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:37.256
I think you should
call her back.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.860
I mean, heck, Sheriff,

01:02:39.903 --> 01:02:42.030
you may have been
the last one to see her.

01:02:45.842 --> 01:02:47.605
Sheriff?

01:02:47.644 --> 01:02:50.306
Okay, I'll call her.

01:02:50.346 --> 01:02:52.678
Good.
You want the number?

01:02:52.715 --> 01:02:56.276
No, it's late.

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:58.810
I'll get it from you
in the AM.

01:03:01.691 --> 01:03:03.090
We're still on
for tomorrow, right?

01:03:03.126 --> 01:03:05.617
Yeah, of course.

01:03:07.597 --> 01:03:11.033
Everything all right?

01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:13.535
Yeah, just fine.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:22.838
It's gone!

01:03:22.879 --> 01:03:24.676
Look at that.

01:03:24.714 --> 01:03:26.705
Looks like someone
spooked the cattle.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.952
It's gone!

01:03:32.989 --> 01:03:34.616
It's fucking gone!

01:03:34.657 --> 01:03:36.921
Jesus, Stanley,
calm the fuck down.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.450
What's got your nuts
in a sling?

01:03:38.495 --> 01:03:41.430
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.

01:03:41.464 --> 01:03:44.126
Maybe you accidentally ate it.

01:03:44.167 --> 01:03:46.658
Fuck off, man,
this is serious!

01:03:50.073 --> 01:03:51.665
It had the tape in it.

01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:53.835
What are you talking about?

01:03:53.877 --> 01:03:55.936
The tape.

01:03:55.979 --> 01:03:58.106
The fucking tape.

01:03:59.449 --> 01:04:02.213
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?

01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:04.379
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.183
I replaced it
with a new one.

01:04:06.222 --> 01:04:10.056
The Sheriff stomped
on the one that had nothing on it.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:17.561
You kept that tape, huh?

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.329
You kept that tape,
you stupid piece of shit?

01:04:19.369 --> 01:04:21.929
Come here.
You kept that tape?

01:04:21.971 --> 01:04:24.462
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!

01:04:24.507 --> 01:04:27.374
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:30.072
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.

01:04:30.113 --> 01:04:31.808
Come on.

01:04:31.848 --> 01:04:34.408
Gotta stick together
on this one.

01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:37.586
You're too dumb to know
how dumb you are.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.451
You know that?

01:05:22.165 --> 01:05:23.826
Uh-huh.

01:05:23.866 --> 01:05:26.562
Is that right?

01:05:29.205 --> 01:05:30.797
Is that right?

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:43.110
I better not find you,
you little fucker.

01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:15.639
All right.
All right, let's go.

01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:18.552
Come on out, fucker.

01:06:18.588 --> 01:06:20.988
Come on!

01:06:21.024 --> 01:06:22.685
You think this shit's funny?

01:06:28.464 --> 01:06:30.830
Andy?

01:06:32.435 --> 01:06:34.460
Stanley?

01:06:38.775 --> 01:06:40.868
Fucking pussies.

01:06:42.278 --> 01:06:45.406
All right. All right.

01:07:14.944 --> 01:07:17.913
That's it, God damn it.

01:07:17.947 --> 01:07:21.110
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:24.085
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.851
Come on out, fucker.

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:32.292
Oh shit.

01:07:35.031 --> 01:07:37.591
Come on.
Come on.

01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:39.624
Come on. Come on.

01:07:55.218 --> 01:07:57.413
Son of a bitch.

01:08:03.659 --> 01:08:05.422
Sweetheart.

01:08:08.698 --> 01:08:10.632
They're beautiful.

01:08:11.868 --> 01:08:13.665
I've been so busy.

01:08:13.703 --> 01:08:16.433
No need to explain.

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:19.497
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:20.975
I guess.

01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:23.478
Maybe you can help me with something
while I put these in water.

01:08:23.513 --> 01:08:25.002
Help with what?

01:08:25.046 --> 01:08:28.038
I got this tape delivered,
but it don't fit our machine.

01:08:28.084 --> 01:08:29.984
What tape?

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:32.680
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.

01:08:38.995 --> 01:08:40.895
Chastity see this?

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:43.831
No. Like I said,
we couldn't get it to play.

01:08:43.866 --> 01:08:46.595
Where is she?

01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:48.627
She's sleeping. Why?

01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:53.564
I'm gonna be back.

01:09:05.688 --> 01:09:07.679
Where the hell you been?

01:09:07.723 --> 01:09:11.215
Beauty queen over here
doing his hair for two hours.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.627
What's this all about, man?

01:09:14.663 --> 01:09:16.598
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?

01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:18.930
Right there.
That's where I got that.

01:09:18.968 --> 01:09:21.265
Somebody left me a present
last night on my doorstep.

01:09:21.304 --> 01:09:24.501
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.531
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.

01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:29.511
No one knows where he's at.

01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:34.812
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.

01:09:42.058 --> 01:09:43.889
What?

01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:46.854
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.

01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:49.921
You wanna tell me why
this was dropped off to my house?

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:53.863
To my wife!

01:09:58.107 --> 01:10:01.975
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?

01:10:02.011 --> 01:10:04.138
I smashed the damn thing myself!

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.946
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.

01:10:07.984 --> 01:10:10.282
The one you smashed
ain't got nothing on it.

01:10:10.319 --> 01:10:12.719
You knew about this?

01:10:12.755 --> 01:10:15.986
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.

01:10:16.025 --> 01:10:19.324
Eat that tape, fat boy!

01:10:19.362 --> 01:10:22.525
Fucking tape!

01:10:22.565 --> 01:10:24.294
You think it's funny?

01:10:26.736 --> 01:10:29.762
You screwed up, fat boy.

01:10:29.805 --> 01:10:32.239
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.

01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:34.709
I mean, dipshit there,
he kept the tape as a souvenir,

01:10:34.744 --> 01:10:36.575
but Matthew's the one
that took it, Sheriff.

01:10:36.612 --> 01:10:39.775
Look at this. Silly bastard
left me a present last night.

01:10:39.815 --> 01:10:42.010
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.

01:10:44.186 --> 01:10:46.746
I think he even
feels guilty.

01:10:46.789 --> 01:10:49.952
You dipshits bring him to me.

01:10:51.794 --> 01:10:53.762
I'm gonna cut
his retard pecker off

01:10:53.796 --> 01:10:55.787
and use it as a goddamn
hood ornament.

01:10:55.831 --> 01:10:58.197
That's before I'm done shoving it
up your dirt hole.

01:10:58.234 --> 01:11:00.134
Shit, we've been looking
for him, Sheriff.

01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:02.103
Trust me, we've been
everywhere looking for him.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.951
I want him found tonight.

01:11:21.357 --> 01:11:22.915
Or I swear to Christ,

01:11:22.959 --> 01:11:25.985
I'll bring the wrath of God
down on you.

01:12:01.497 --> 01:12:03.965
Can you believe there used
to be a limit on quail?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.436
Goddamn things
are like locusts now.

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.836
Much to our good fortune.

01:12:12.074 --> 01:12:14.440
I gotta take a break.

01:12:14.477 --> 01:12:17.037
My dogs are barking
something fierce.

01:12:20.983 --> 01:12:22.974
I remember when you and my old man
chased that buck

01:12:23.019 --> 01:12:26.045
out from the hollows
on Stickler Farm before bagging it.

01:12:27.323 --> 01:12:30.622
Aww. Them were
the good old days.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.561
To the good old days.

01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:37.191
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?

01:12:37.233 --> 01:12:38.564
You just enjoy it.

01:12:45.775 --> 01:12:48.642
This is some fine whiskey.

01:12:50.579 --> 01:12:54.538
Usually you don't get
something like this except at baptisms

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:57.051
and weddings.

01:12:57.086 --> 01:12:59.418
And funerals.

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:08.562
Loose ends, Earl.

01:13:12.668 --> 01:13:14.863
Loose ends.

01:13:33.355 --> 01:13:36.222
Jennifer: Matthew.

01:13:38.694 --> 01:13:41.424
I'm over here.

01:13:48.037 --> 01:13:50.028
Jennifer:
Matthew.

01:13:53.809 --> 01:13:56.334
Matthew.

01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:29.868
I- I knew-
knew you were alive.

01:14:31.547 --> 01:14:33.139
I knew it.

01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:35.707
How did you know, Matthew?

01:14:35.751 --> 01:14:37.981
Huh?

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.580
How did you know
I was alive?

01:14:40.623 --> 01:14:44.184
Are you sure
you're not dreaming?

01:14:46.829 --> 01:14:48.626
Am I?

01:14:48.664 --> 01:14:50.564
Am I dreaming?

01:14:50.599 --> 01:14:52.965
Come here.

01:14:53.002 --> 01:14:54.833
Sit with me.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.939
I need to tell you-

01:15:08.984 --> 01:15:11.578
Shh!

01:15:13.956 --> 01:15:17.619
I know, Matthew.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.890
I know this wasn't your fault.

01:15:22.398 --> 01:15:24.366
You tried to help me.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.197
I did.

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:30.228
I really really did.

01:15:33.008 --> 01:15:34.839
And- and-

01:15:34.877 --> 01:15:37.004
and you're okay.

01:15:37.046 --> 01:15:41.039
You're- you're okay.

01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:45.076
Yes, Matthew.

01:15:48.324 --> 01:15:49.916
Now come.

01:15:54.964 --> 01:15:56.955
Come on.

01:15:56.999 --> 01:15:58.466
It's okay.

01:15:59.869 --> 01:16:02.838
It's okay.

01:16:02.872 --> 01:16:06.808
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.

01:16:06.842 --> 01:16:09.936
I'm so sorry.

01:16:16.185 --> 01:16:19.712
Oh God!

01:16:27.763 --> 01:16:29.822
I'm so sorry.

01:16:29.865 --> 01:16:31.628
Matthew.

01:16:35.638 --> 01:16:38.072
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

01:16:38.107 --> 01:16:40.041
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.345
Tell me again
how sorry you are.

01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:09.895
I'm- I'm- I'm sorry.

01:17:12.574 --> 01:17:15.372
It's just not good enough!

01:17:24.386 --> 01:17:26.956
Stanley:
Matthew!

01:17:31.727 --> 01:17:33.820
Matthew!

01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:38.995
Andy:
Matthew!

01:17:41.303 --> 01:17:43.430
Matthew!

01:17:59.355 --> 01:18:01.346
Matthew!

01:18:07.463 --> 01:18:09.522
Come on out, Matthew.

01:18:14.003 --> 01:18:15.994
Matthew!

01:18:33.322 --> 01:18:35.313
Matthew?

01:18:42.998 --> 01:18:45.990
You're only making it harder
on yourself, Matt.

01:18:56.412 --> 01:18:58.744
Boo!

01:18:58.781 --> 01:19:01.477
Stupid fuck,
what the hell's wrong with you?

01:19:01.517 --> 01:19:03.178
Whoo!

01:19:09.858 --> 01:19:11.849
Fucker's playing your song.

01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:19.567
Andy:
Your ass is grass, Matthew.

01:19:19.601 --> 01:19:22.399
Stanley:
Matthew, you're a dead man.

01:19:22.438 --> 01:19:24.633
Whoo!

01:19:28.777 --> 01:19:31.803
- Come on, man.
- I'm gonna kill him.

01:19:31.847 --> 01:19:34.179
Don't you pass out on me.

01:19:34.216 --> 01:19:37.185
I'm too tired to drag
your ass back.

01:19:44.827 --> 01:19:48.285
What the hell?

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:50.491
Matthew?

01:19:53.535 --> 01:19:56.026
Stanley:
Matthew!

01:19:56.071 --> 01:19:59.563
God damn it, Matthew,
where are you?

01:19:59.608 --> 01:20:02.975
Where are you,
you little fucker?

01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:12.181
Andy, he ain't out here.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.751
You little bitch.

01:20:29.438 --> 01:20:33.374
Andy! Andy!

01:20:33.408 --> 01:20:36.206
Andy, help me!

01:20:38.981 --> 01:20:40.471
What the fuck, man?

01:20:40.516 --> 01:20:42.040
- My leg!
- Ahem.

01:20:43.719 --> 01:20:45.516
Andy!

01:21:30.299 --> 01:21:32.927
Stanley!

01:21:36.838 --> 01:21:40.569
Stanley, help me!

01:21:40.609 --> 01:21:43.442
Matthew?

01:21:43.478 --> 01:21:46.276
Help me!
Please!

01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:52.081
Somebody!

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.611
Andy:
Stanley!

01:21:57.459 --> 01:21:59.518
Come on, Stanley.

01:22:02.864 --> 01:22:05.765
Matthew, this shit
ain't funny, boy.

01:22:07.736 --> 01:22:09.897
Somebody help me!

01:22:09.938 --> 01:22:12.304
Jennifer: Smile real pretty
for the camera, boy.

01:22:12.341 --> 01:22:14.969
Andy: Please!

01:22:17.946 --> 01:22:21.313
I know you like to watch,
don't you?

01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:24.581
Don't you, you sick fuck?

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:28.454
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.617
Andy:
Matthew!

01:22:32.961 --> 01:22:35.191
Matthew!

01:22:39.268 --> 01:22:41.429
- Here you go.
- Stanley!

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:43.370
You remember this?

01:22:43.405 --> 01:22:45.839
Stanley, help me!

01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:57.414
Somebody help me!

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.746
Help!

01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:04.020
Can't talk, can you?

01:23:04.059 --> 01:23:07.392
Maybe it's because
you're hungry.

01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:16.228
You know, you gotta eat a lot
of nasty shit out here to stay alive.

01:23:21.143 --> 01:23:24.601
Are you hungry?
You hungry?

01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:30.047
What's wrong?
You don't like it?

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:47.260
What are you doing?

01:23:47.302 --> 01:23:49.634
Some fishing.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.774
I know how you guys
like to fish.

01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:28.733
Don't blink.

01:24:29.778 --> 01:24:32.338
Andy:
You okay, Stan?

01:25:00.609 --> 01:25:02.600
How's it going?

01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:23.597
I'm sorry.

01:25:28.437 --> 01:25:30.632
Please!

01:25:30.672 --> 01:25:34.631
Please is what I said to you.

01:25:34.676 --> 01:25:37.201
You said...

01:25:37.245 --> 01:25:39.008
"Suck it, bitch. "

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:45.482
Does that ring any bells?

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.647
Suck...

01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:50.157
it...

01:25:50.192 --> 01:25:51.386
bitch!

01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:01.669
Be right back.

01:26:03.638 --> 01:26:07.165
Wait, come back.
Come back here.

01:26:07.209 --> 01:26:10.042
Come back here.

01:26:12.347 --> 01:26:15.180
Andy: Stanley!

01:26:17.018 --> 01:26:19.418
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you bitch.

01:26:22.357 --> 01:26:25.884
Hi.

01:26:25.927 --> 01:26:27.417
You like the show so far?

01:26:27.462 --> 01:26:29.020
Andy:
Let me out of here!

01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:31.726
Wait.

01:26:31.766 --> 01:26:33.290
It gets better.

01:26:33.335 --> 01:26:37.294
Please, my eyes.

01:26:37.339 --> 01:26:40.331
I can't take it anymore.

01:26:40.375 --> 01:26:42.935
Oh, let me help you.

01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:56.617
Let me out!

01:26:58.994 --> 01:27:00.552
Stanley!

01:27:00.595 --> 01:27:02.825
Please.

01:27:05.166 --> 01:27:07.157
Please.

01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:11.396
Please. Please.

01:27:17.612 --> 01:27:19.580
That might feel better.

01:27:24.386 --> 01:27:26.377
Andy:
Help!

01:27:32.227 --> 01:27:34.991
Huh-uh-uh,
now don't drown too soon.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.865
Fuck you.

01:27:47.909 --> 01:27:50.571
Now is that any way
to talk to a lady?

01:28:07.362 --> 01:28:08.624
I'm impressed.

01:28:08.663 --> 01:28:10.824
You got a lot of fight in you.

01:28:10.865 --> 01:28:12.958
Let's see how you do now.

01:28:14.769 --> 01:28:17.567
What's that?

01:28:17.606 --> 01:28:20.131
It's just some lye
I found laying around.

01:28:24.212 --> 01:28:26.476
No!

01:28:29.284 --> 01:28:31.081
Let's see how long you can keep

01:28:31.119 --> 01:28:33.519
that pretty little face of yours.

01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:35.614
Fuck you!

01:28:37.525 --> 01:28:39.618
You already did that.

01:28:39.661 --> 01:28:41.959
I didn't enjoy it much.

01:28:41.997 --> 01:28:45.626
Now it's my turn
to fuck you.

01:28:47.369 --> 01:28:50.065
- Please. Please.
- Oh.

01:28:50.105 --> 01:28:51.970
Please.

01:30:26.034 --> 01:30:28.161
Pain in the ass.

01:30:36.878 --> 01:30:38.971
Good morning.

01:30:39.013 --> 01:30:41.277
Whoo.

01:30:41.316 --> 01:30:43.944
Hey there.
Can I fill you up?

01:31:18.386 --> 01:31:20.718
It's date night.

01:31:33.535 --> 01:31:35.526
Your mouth doesn't look
so good.

01:31:36.805 --> 01:31:39.672
Maybe you should show me
your teeth.

01:31:53.955 --> 01:31:57.488
I'll kill you.

01:32:03.064 --> 01:32:05.089
Ornery stallion.

01:32:07.068 --> 01:32:09.298
Guess I'm gonna
have to tame you.

01:32:24.452 --> 01:32:28.286
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.

01:32:28.323 --> 01:32:31.315
I'm gonna have to
take care of that.

01:32:39.667 --> 01:32:41.760
Huh? Huh?

01:32:41.803 --> 01:32:44.738
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!

01:32:50.378 --> 01:32:52.573
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races

01:32:52.614 --> 01:32:54.479
left to run, show horse.

01:33:17.338 --> 01:33:20.000
That is disgusting.

01:33:21.976 --> 01:33:24.501
Even your boys
didn't piss themselves.

01:33:30.985 --> 01:33:33.954
Look who's here.

01:33:33.988 --> 01:33:37.389
It's my boyfriend.

01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:39.620
Remember him?

01:33:41.596 --> 01:33:43.655
Why don't you give him
a little kiss?

01:33:45.366 --> 01:33:47.891
Hmm? Hmm?

01:33:47.936 --> 01:33:49.995
Let's go, come on.

01:33:50.038 --> 01:33:53.405
I don't take orders
from no fucking woman.

01:33:53.441 --> 01:33:55.170
No?

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.446
Breathe through your nose.

01:34:01.482 --> 01:34:03.814
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.

01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:06.081
Just like it was
your first time, remember?

01:34:14.562 --> 01:34:15.893
Fuck you!

01:34:17.432 --> 01:34:18.865
Fuck you!

01:34:20.134 --> 01:34:22.193
Fuck you!

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.171
Let me tell you something:

01:34:34.215 --> 01:34:37.013
You know,

01:34:37.051 --> 01:34:40.077
you weren't even
a good blowjob.

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.320
No.

01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:50.925
You know what they do to horses

01:34:50.965 --> 01:34:52.899
that can't be tamed, Johnny?

01:34:57.305 --> 01:34:59.205
You geld them.

01:35:04.612 --> 01:35:06.477
No teeth, show horse.

01:35:06.514 --> 01:35:08.573
No teeth.

01:35:16.524 --> 01:35:18.685
Bitch!

01:36:10.144 --> 01:36:13.045
Hey, sweetheart.

01:36:13.081 --> 01:36:17.040
- Chastity's new teacher's here.
- Storch: Mrs. Novick?

01:36:17.085 --> 01:36:20.680
No, from the honors program.

01:36:20.721 --> 01:36:24.020
- Do you remember anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right.

01:36:25.426 --> 01:36:28.054
- I'm real busy, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.

01:36:28.096 --> 01:36:30.860
Hello, angel.

01:36:30.898 --> 01:36:32.991
Daddy's real busy working.

01:36:33.034 --> 01:36:34.797
But I really want you
to meet my new teacher.

01:36:36.504 --> 01:36:38.028
She's way cool.

01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:42.271
Here. Just say hi.

01:36:45.012 --> 01:36:46.809
Howdy, Sheriff.

01:36:46.848 --> 01:36:49.043
It's truly an honor

01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:50.983
to speak with you, Miss...

01:36:51.018 --> 01:36:53.350
Hills, Jennifer Hills.

01:36:57.625 --> 01:36:59.855
Excuse me?

01:36:59.894 --> 01:37:02.863
I have to tell you it's been
a pleasure meeting your family.

01:37:02.897 --> 01:37:05.263
You have a wonderful daughter

01:37:05.299 --> 01:37:08.097
with a bright
and promising future.

01:37:09.704 --> 01:37:12.332
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:37:12.373 --> 01:37:14.136
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

01:37:14.175 --> 01:37:15.699
No, wait!

01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:24.312
Shit!

01:37:46.874 --> 01:37:48.171
Chastity, where is she?

01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:49.506
She went to Hanson Park
with Miss Hills.

01:37:49.544 --> 01:37:52.513
She wanted to get to know her students
in the program before the year st-

01:37:52.547 --> 01:37:54.412
God damn it!

01:37:54.448 --> 01:37:55.745
Who is she?

01:37:58.152 --> 01:37:59.881
Who is this woman?

01:38:22.677 --> 01:38:24.668
Chastity!

01:38:31.285 --> 01:38:33.412
Chastity!

01:38:35.423 --> 01:38:37.653
Where are you, angel?

01:38:45.466 --> 01:38:47.457
Chastity!

01:39:29.243 --> 01:39:32.440
Oh no! No!

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.038
Please!

01:39:36.917 --> 01:39:39.385
No.

01:39:45.493 --> 01:39:47.893
Help me, Jesus.

01:39:47.928 --> 01:39:50.192
Does that hurt, Sheriff?

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.692
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.

01:39:55.736 --> 01:39:58.728
Where is she, you bitch?

01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:05.710
I'd be real careful
how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.

01:40:05.746 --> 01:40:08.772
What have you done to her?

01:40:11.952 --> 01:40:14.512
By her, I assume
you mean your daughter?

01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:18.558
She really is lovely, Sheriff.

01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:24.396
So young.

01:40:24.432 --> 01:40:26.093
So sweet.

01:40:27.868 --> 01:40:30.336
So innocent.

01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:37.867
I mean, can you imagine?

01:40:37.912 --> 01:40:39.880
Imagine what?

01:40:45.086 --> 01:40:47.782
Imagine that somebody
had done something

01:40:47.822 --> 01:40:50.882
like this to her.

01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:56.127
Someone like Andy.

01:40:56.163 --> 01:40:59.394
Or Stanley or Johnny.

01:40:59.433 --> 01:41:00.957
Or more likely you,

01:41:01.001 --> 01:41:03.970
you sick, perverted rapist!

01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:11.477
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!

01:41:11.512 --> 01:41:14.140
Deep! Deep!

01:41:14.181 --> 01:41:15.910
Deep! Deep! Deep!

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:18.350
Jesus fucking Jesus.

01:41:25.493 --> 01:41:27.927
Please.

01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:34.999
Ma'am.
Ma'am.

01:41:43.844 --> 01:41:46.369
She's just an innocent girl.

01:41:55.656 --> 01:41:57.647
So was I.

01:42:05.232 --> 01:42:07.860
What are you doing? What?

01:42:12.106 --> 01:42:14.472
Matthew.

01:42:25.219 --> 01:42:27.278
You won't get
a- fucking-way with this.

01:42:30.024 --> 01:42:32.049
You won't get away with this!

01:42:34.862 --> 01:42:38.059
He'll be waking up soon.

01:42:38.098 --> 01:42:40.566
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.

01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:43.263
Please, I'm begging you.

01:42:44.705 --> 01:42:47.003
I'm a God-fearing person.

01:42:47.041 --> 01:42:48.599
I got-

01:42:48.642 --> 01:42:52.009
I've got a baby coming, please.

01:42:52.046 --> 01:42:54.879
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.

01:42:54.915 --> 01:42:57.748
Sorry, Sheriff.

01:42:57.785 --> 01:43:00.185
It was fun while it lasted.

01:43:05.059 --> 01:43:08.722
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.

01:43:08.762 --> 01:43:11.424
I'm begging you to help me.

01:43:11.465 --> 01:43:13.558
Please help me.

01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:16.900
I've got a wife and family.

01:43:16.937 --> 01:43:18.996
Ma'am, please!

01:43:20.741 --> 01:43:23.141
You fuck!
You fuck!

01:43:24.545 --> 01:43:26.376
You fuck!

01:43:26.413 --> 01:43:28.438
Where are you going, you fuck?

01:43:28.482 --> 01:43:30.780
I'll see you in hell!

01:43:30.818 --> 01:43:33.252
I'll rape you in hell!

01:43:33.287 --> 01:43:35.653
You're just a piece of meat.

01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:37.418
I'll find you.

01:43:37.458 --> 01:43:40.393
I'll hunt you down in hell,
you bitch!

01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:45.829
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?

01:43:45.866 --> 01:43:47.731
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.

01:43:47.768 --> 01:43:50.032
Matthew!
