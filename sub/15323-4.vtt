WEBVTT

00:00.181 --> 00:01.135
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:01.135 --> 00:02.448
BAIL DENIED.

00:02.448 --> 00:03.938
WE'LL GET YOU OUT,
SON.

00:03.938 --> 00:05.005
YOU BE STRONG.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.273
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
THAT GUY?

00:06.273 --> 00:08.042
PRESSURING PEOPLE --
MY OWN AUNT --

00:08.042 --> 00:09.543
INTO LYING
TO THE POLICE?

00:09.543 --> 00:12.146
WHEN I STARTED TRYING
TO GET YOUR BROTHER OUT OF JAIL.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.548
OUR ENTIRE CASE DEPENDS
ON YOUR TESTIFYING AT TRIAL.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.317
MY BROTHER
IS INNOCENT.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.586
SO WITH CONNIE GONE,
THEY'RE BOTH FREE.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.221
TWO BIRDS, ONE STONE,
JACK.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.223
I CAN'T EAT,
I CAN'T SLEEP,

00:22.223 --> 00:23.824
I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.926
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME
A WEEK AGO.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.261
I MET SOMEONE.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.697
AND NOW
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.676
HOLA!

00:42.676 --> 00:44.278
H-- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

00:44.278 --> 00:45.846
HOW WAS THE TRIP?

00:45.846 --> 00:47.181
WHOA.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.283
DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE GOING TO THE BAHAMAS.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.685
W-WE WERE SHOOTING
OUTSIDE.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.187
OUTSIDE, HUH?

00:53.187 --> 00:56.323
THAT'S A WEIRD PLACE
TO GET A SUNBURN.

00:56.323 --> 00:59.193
NOW, ABOUT
THIS PROSECUTOR.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.795
DREW STAFFORD --
WHAT HAVE WE GOT ON HIM?

01:01.795 --> 01:04.198
SEVEN YEARS
AS A STATE'S ATTORNEY.

01:04.198 --> 01:07.501
NO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS,
NO COMPLAINTS.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.137
HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE,
LAW SCHOOL.

01:10.137 --> 01:13.507
NO DRUGS, NO BOOZE,
NO DEBTS, NO GIRLS.

01:13.507 --> 01:17.211
I GOT YA. RELAX.

01:21.549 --> 01:25.286
IT PUTS THE LOTION
ON THE SKIN.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.954
"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."

01:26.954 --> 01:28.522
I AM NOT KILLING IT
WITH THE JOKES HERE.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.891
OH, I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST, UH...

01:30.891 --> 01:33.227
OLIVER'S DOWN THE HALL,
AND I SHOULD GET DRESSED.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.728
HE'S FINE.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.099
BUT THERE'S
ANOTHER THING --

01:39.099 --> 01:41.635
SOMETHING WE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE --

01:41.635 --> 01:43.204
ON THE WIFE.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.439
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TALK TO ME, RIGHT?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.042
WHATEVER IT IS.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.977
YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.213
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.515
STAFFORD'S WIFE?
YEAH.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.084
SHE'S SCREWING SOME LOSER.

01:59.186 --> 02:02.823
SARA, I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING SOMEONE.

02:04.158 --> 02:07.161
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:24.011 --> 02:25.879
HI.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.048
HI.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.727
HOW ARE YOU?

02:39.727 --> 02:42.196
OKAY.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.530
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.466
GOOD.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.334
BETTER NOW.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.609
HI.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.245
HI.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.449
HOW DO WE DO THIS?
WHAT DO WE DO?

03:02.449 --> 03:05.519
WE COULD JUST
HAVE A STARING CONTEST.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.393
I HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.762
ASK ME
ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.564
WILL YOU COME KISS ME?

03:17.564 --> 03:19.400
NO.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.603
NO,
YOU WON'T COME KISS ME?

03:22.603 --> 03:25.673
I WANT TO LOOK AT YOU,
SARA.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.748
I JUST...

03:34.748 --> 03:36.750
I JUST
WANT TO LOOK AT YOU.

03:48.662 --> 03:52.132
SARA,
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

03:52.132 --> 03:53.634
DON'T LET ME GET MUGGED

03:53.634 --> 03:56.303
IN THIS ARTSY,
TRANSITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.077
HEY.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.516
ALISSA, THIS IS
ONE OF MY NEW CLIENTS.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.286
FRED. FRED McCRACKEN.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.755
I SHOULD HAVE
BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.657
HI. ALISSA BURNS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
A PLEASURE.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.592
FRED McCRACKEN.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.794
SO, I HAVE 13 MINUTES

04:20.794 --> 04:22.162
TO LOOK AT
BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF TACOS

04:22.162 --> 04:23.997
BEFORE MY CAR
GETS TOWED OR STOLEN --

04:23.997 --> 04:25.699
PROBABLY STOLEN.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.368
YOU FORGOT
YOU INVITED ME HERE

04:27.368 --> 04:29.203
TO LOOK AT
BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF TACOS.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.939
I DID NOT FORGET.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.973
UH,
I SHOULD GET GOING,

04:32.973 --> 04:34.708
BUT, UH,
IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.244
OH, YEAH, YOU TOO.
BYE.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.512
BYE, FRED.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.080
OH, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TELL YOU

04:40.080 --> 04:42.216
THAT THE MILWAUKEE SHOOT
WAS CANCELED.

04:42.216 --> 04:44.017
THE MAGAZINE
CAN'T PAY FOR THE HOTEL.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.321
WAS THAT HIM?

04:47.321 --> 04:48.322
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

04:48.322 --> 04:50.924
HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.526
YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S TRUE.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.695
BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.999
I KNOW. I KNOW.
IT'S CRAZY.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.101
DID YOU CALL
THE THERAPIST?

05:01.101 --> 05:06.106
I CALLED
AND I MADE AN APPOINTMENT.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.941
I'M NOT SURE
I'M GONNA GO.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.177
YOU GOT A LOT
HAPPENING HERE, SARA.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.913
I MEAN, THERAPISTS CAN BE
HELPFUL IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.216
IT'S CHEAPER
THAN A DIVORCE LAWYER.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.688
DREW STAFFORD?

05:21.688 --> 05:23.791
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.292
YEAH, WELL,

05:25.292 --> 05:28.028
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
A VENDETTA AGAINST MY FAMILY.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.696
HE WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST ONE.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.967
ABOUT
THAT OTHER THING --

05:33.967 --> 05:36.036
I REALLY COULD
USE YOUR HELP.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.505
SO COULD MY SON T.J.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.740
THATCHER --

05:39.740 --> 05:41.508
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.210
LET'S GO TO THE BERGHOFF.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.412
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
OVER LUNCH. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:45.412 --> 05:47.948
DOES THE BERGHOFF
EVEN STILL EXIST?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.817
IT'S BEEN THERE 100 YEARS.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.254
I'M NOT GOING TO LUNCH,
THATCHER.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.756
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.460
WHAT, EAT LUNCH?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.528
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.930
NOT THIS TIME.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.637
I NEED THIS ONE, MONICA.

06:10.637 --> 06:14.074
I WOULDN'T ASK
IF IT WASN'T VITAL.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.844
I KNOW.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.514
BUT THINGS
AREN'T LIKE THEY USED TO BE.

06:20.514 --> 06:24.284
THIS TOWN --
IT'S CHANGING.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.294
SEE YOU THE NEXT TIME.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.064
I MAY BE BUSY FOR A WHILE.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.398
I'LL CALL YOU.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.372
YOUR ONE WITNESS
HAS DISAPPEARED.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.307
NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.
NO GUN.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.010
AND NOW T.J. KARSTEN
HAS ANOTHER BAIL HEARING.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.311
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO NEGATIVE.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.547
YOU UNDERMINED
A TWO-YEAR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

06:53.547 --> 06:55.482
BY RUSHING INTO THIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.150
AND NOW
YOUR CRACKERJACK MURDER CASE

06:57.150 --> 07:00.053
HAS BLOWN UP --
LITERALLY BLOWN UP.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.056
CAN I SAY SOMETHING,
OR IS THIS JUST A LECTURE?

07:04.324 --> 07:07.060
T.J. KARSTEN
IS NOT GONNA GET OUT ON BAIL.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.463
WE ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNIE MROZEK,
AND WE WILL FIND HER.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.732
NOW, CAN WE GET REAL

07:11.732 --> 07:14.535
ABOUT THIS VAUNTED
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF YOURS?

07:14.535 --> 07:18.805
YOU BLUE SUITS WERE AT THIS
FOR, WHAT, TWO YEARS?

07:18.805 --> 07:22.910
AND THE ONE MAN YOU HAD
TO MAKE YOUR CASE

07:22.910 --> 07:25.746
IS DEAD --
BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.649
NOW, I'M NOT THRILLED ABOUT
THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,

07:28.649 --> 07:32.486
BUT I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT
HAS ANYTHING ON THIS FAMILY.

07:32.486 --> 07:36.690
SO, PLEASE, GET BEHIND ME

07:36.690 --> 07:40.494
OR GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY WAY.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.597
MR. McALLISTER, WHY DO WE NEED

07:43.597 --> 07:45.499
ANOTHER BAIL HEARING
IN THIS CASE?

07:45.499 --> 07:47.067
WE DON'T, YOUR HONOR,
IF I MAY.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.268
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.937
MR. KARSTEN WAS DENIED BAIL
TWO DAYS AGO.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.171
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.740
YOUR ONLY WITNESS
HAS SUDDENLY GONE MISSING,

07:53.740 --> 07:55.275
SO THAT'S ONE CHANGE.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.611
MRS. MROZEK IS NOT
OUR ONLY WITNESS,
SHE IS NOT MISSING,

07:57.611 --> 07:59.513
AND, IN ANY EVENT,
WE HAVE HER STATEMENT --

07:59.513 --> 08:01.081
A VERY STRONG STATEMENT.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.216
BY "STATEMENT,"
YOU MEAN INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY

08:03.216 --> 08:05.852
THAT NO COURT IN THIS
COUNTRY WOULD EVER
ALLOW INTO EVIDENCE?

08:05.852 --> 08:08.522
YOUR HONOR, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
A MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER,

08:08.522 --> 08:10.057
FACING
A POTENTIAL LIFE SENTENCE

08:10.057 --> 08:12.092
WITH EVERY MOTIVATION
AND RESOURCE TO FLEE.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.427
THOSE WERE THE FACTS
TWO DAYS AGO.

08:13.427 --> 08:14.494
THOSE ARE THE FACTS
TODAY.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.197
I'M GOING TO SET BAIL
AT $1 MILLION.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.632
I ASSUME YOU CAN POST THAT.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.034
OF COURSE. THANK YOU.
WHAT?!

08:21.034 --> 08:23.570
YOUR HONOR, RESPECTFULLY,
UNDER SECTION 110-4, NO --

08:23.570 --> 08:24.905
I KNOW THE STATUTE.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.407
YOU CAN SEE
I'M A JUDGE UP HERE, RIGHT?

08:27.407 --> 08:29.209
THE ROBE AND ALL.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.854
THAT WAS
EASIER THAN I THOUGHT.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.589
HER SON WANTS TO GO
TO MICHIGAN LAW,

08:42.589 --> 08:44.524
SO NOW HE'S GOING
TO MICHIGAN LAW.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.593
BUT HE'S ON HIS OWN
FOR THE BAR EXAM.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.161
YOU DID THAT?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.930
OF COURSE.
HOW DO YOU THINK IT HAPPENED?

08:49.930 --> 08:54.067
WE HAD A GOOD ARGUMENT,
BUT I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.

09:07.189 --> 09:08.924
11:30?
No.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.526
12:00?
NO.

09:10.526 --> 09:12.360
12:30?
NO.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.829
SERIOUSLY? THIS IS HARDER THAN
GETTING A TABLE AT ALINEA.

09:14.829 --> 09:17.064
WELL, I HAVE TO WORK HERE
UNTIL 3:00,

09:17.064 --> 09:20.434
AND THEN I NEED TO BE
AT A SHOOT AT 3:15, SO...

09:20.434 --> 09:23.938
I'LL, UM, I'LL CALL YOU
IF I HAVE ANY CANCELATIONS.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.640
BRUTAL.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.375
COME WITH ME.
I NEED YOU.

09:30.144 --> 09:32.547
WE NEED TO
RESTRUCTURE SOME DATA.

09:32.547 --> 09:34.682
IS THAT OLD-MAN CODE FOR
"DESTROYING FILES"?

09:34.682 --> 09:36.551
I'M NOT OLD.
COMPARED TO WHAT?

09:38.886 --> 09:40.721
CAN YOU DO THIS?

09:40.721 --> 09:42.523
ALL OF THESE --
ALL THE DIRECTORIES?

09:42.523 --> 09:44.025
AS IF THEY NEVER EXISTED.

09:44.025 --> 09:45.793
AS IF WHAT NEVER EXISTED?

09:48.796 --> 09:50.431
JACK.

09:50.431 --> 09:52.833
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.403
I ASKED YOUR DAUGHTER
ON A DATE.

09:55.403 --> 09:58.339
YOU ASKED VAL ON A DATE?

09:58.339 --> 10:00.808
SHE LIKES GIRLS.
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.377
I<i> DO</i> KNOW.

10:03.377 --> 10:05.713
GIRLS AREN'T THE PROBLEM.
<i>YOU'RE</i> THE PROBLEM.

10:05.713 --> 10:07.348
YOU WORK HERE,
AND YOU'RE TOO OLD.

10:07.348 --> 10:09.584
I'M NOT OLD.
COMPARED TO VAL?

10:12.553 --> 10:15.022
A DATE.

10:16.424 --> 10:18.259
STOP THAT.

10:19.627 --> 10:22.363
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
ROBERT.

10:22.363 --> 10:23.531
YEAH.

10:23.531 --> 10:25.600
YEAH, I'LL GET INTO IT
RIGHT AWAY.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.401
THANK YOU.

10:27.401 --> 10:30.037
I'M HAVING I.T.
DO SOME FILE HOUSEKEEPING.

10:30.037 --> 10:31.439
THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION
SEEMS TO BE --

10:31.439 --> 10:33.874
THAT WAS THE ARCHITECT
ON THE STREETERVILLE PROJECT.

10:33.874 --> 10:35.443
HE'S NOT GETTING PAID.

10:35.443 --> 10:37.411
EVIDENTLY,
THE BANK FROZE THE FUNDING.

10:37.411 --> 10:39.013
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT,
JACK?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.115
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.021
NO BANK HAS EVER DONE THIS
TO ME, NOT IN 43 YEARS.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.356
I'LL CALL THEM.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.758
DON'T BOTHER.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF.

10:50.758 --> 10:52.793
ARE YOU OKAY, JACK?

10:52.793 --> 10:55.463
YOU SEEM DISTRACTED
LATELY.
DISTRACTED?

10:55.463 --> 10:57.098
WELL, I WASN'T TOO DISTRACTED
TO MAKE SURE

10:57.098 --> 10:59.300
T.J.'s BAIL HEARING
WENT OUR WAY.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.737
NO. YOU PULLED SOME
TRICK WITH THE JUDGE,
AND WE GOT WHAT WE NEEDED.

11:02.737 --> 11:05.273
BUT T.J. IS STILL
FACING A MURDER CHARGE.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.742
I'VE GOT THE STATE'S ATTORNEY
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

11:07.742 --> 11:10.778
AND NOW
A KEY PIECE OF MY BUSINESS

11:10.778 --> 11:12.980
IS BEING SHUT DOWN
BY THE BANK.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.715
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I OUGHT TO DO, JACK?

11:14.715 --> 11:17.918
JUST SIT ON MY ASS WHILE
EVERYTHING I CARE ABOUT
GOES IN THE TOILET?

11:17.918 --> 11:19.587
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
I'M DOING?

11:19.587 --> 11:22.657
WHAT I'M SAYING, JACK,
IS GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

11:22.657 --> 11:25.393
THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.395
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT

11:27.395 --> 11:29.864
WHILE I'M IN MICHIGAN
RETURNING THE JUDGE'S FAVOR.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.603
THE KX-600
LISTENING DEVICE --

11:35.603 --> 11:37.938
EXTREMELY POWERFUL,
EASY TO PLACE,

11:37.938 --> 11:39.874
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO DETECT.

11:39.874 --> 11:42.076
NOW, THE RULES --
NO WATER, NO DIRECT SUNLIGHT,

11:42.076 --> 11:44.145
AND KEEP OUT OF THE REACH
OF SMALL CHILDREN.

11:44.145 --> 11:48.482
IT'S A CHOKING HAZARD.

11:48.482 --> 11:50.918
ALSO, IT WORKS BEST
WITH A WARRANT.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.753
YEAH,
I'M WORKING ON THAT.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.723
NEED TO MOVE FAST, THOUGH.
I'M FEELING THE HEAT.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.596
HEY.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.432
SHARE A CAB?

12:07.368 --> 12:09.603
HOW LONG WE GOT?
15 MINUTES,

12:09.603 --> 12:12.039
BUT, SEE, NOW WE'RE WASTING TIME
TALKING ABOUT IT.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.975
HEY, LET'S KEEP IT CLEAN
BACK THERE.

12:14.975 --> 12:16.877
YES, SIR.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.881
14 MINUTES.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.090
YES?

12:29.090 --> 12:31.158
Your 3:00
from the bank is here.

12:31.158 --> 12:33.327
SEND HIM IN.

12:35.196 --> 12:36.597
BRUCE.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.234
YOU'RE NOT BRUCE.
NO.

12:40.234 --> 12:41.769
BRUCE HAD
ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.676
COME AWAY WITH ME
FOR THE NIGHT.

12:48.676 --> 12:50.111
FOR THE NIGHT?

12:50.111 --> 12:52.079
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN MILWAUKEE ON A SHOOT.

12:52.079 --> 12:53.681
I'VE GOT BUSINESS
IN MICHIGAN,

12:53.681 --> 12:55.349
BUT I CAN HANDLE IT
FROM HERE.

12:59.186 --> 13:01.655
I KNOW
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.991
YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING.

13:07.595 --> 13:08.863
I'LL BE HERE.

13:13.067 --> 13:15.703
DON'T STAND ME UP AGAIN.

13:18.873 --> 13:20.975
IT'S SIMPLE, MR. KARSTEN.

13:20.975 --> 13:23.577
WE CAN'T FUND A PROJECT
NOT PROPERLY ZONED,

13:23.577 --> 13:25.546
AND YOUR
STREETERVILLE DEVELOPMENT --

13:25.546 --> 13:29.116
THE ZONING IS BEING HANDLED
BY ALDERMAN ARKOVICH.

13:29.116 --> 13:31.218
THERE'S A VOTE.

13:31.218 --> 13:33.521
THAT VOTE'S
BEEN TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.891
YOU'RE TELLING<i> ME</i> THE VOTE'S
BEEN TAKEN OFF THE CALENDAR?

13:36.891 --> 13:38.692
APPARENTLY, YES.

13:38.692 --> 13:41.929
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW MANY BANKS
I COULD GO TO WITH THIS?

13:41.929 --> 13:44.365
NO. HOW MANY?

13:48.736 --> 13:50.237
I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING IN TO SEE ME.

13:50.237 --> 13:51.806
I KNOW YOU'RE
IN A BIT OF A PREDICAMENT.

13:51.806 --> 13:54.975
WHAT PREDICAMENT?

13:54.975 --> 13:57.778
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,
MR. STAFFORD?

13:57.778 --> 14:00.915
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ONE OF MY CASES.

14:00.915 --> 14:02.383
LOU MROZEK.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.252
OLD MAN FOUND SHOT AND KILLED
DOWN AT THE WATER

14:05.252 --> 14:08.055
BY A FRIEND OF YOURS --
T.J. KARSTEN.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.891
I ALREADY
GAVE MY STATEMENT.

14:10.891 --> 14:14.295
AND YOUR STATEMENT
WAS A LIE.

14:14.295 --> 14:17.164
T.J. WAS WITH ME
AT PINTER'S THAT NIGHT.

14:17.164 --> 14:19.834
HOW MUCH IS THATCHER KARSTEN
PAYING YOU TO SAY THAT?

14:19.834 --> 14:22.770
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

14:22.770 --> 14:24.605
I DON'T HAVE TO
TALK TO YOU.

14:24.605 --> 14:26.707
THAT'S RIGHT,
BRANDY FROM LITHUANIA

14:26.707 --> 14:29.210
WORKING AS A HOOKER
ON AN EXPIRED STUDENT VISA.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.578
YOU DON'T.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.079
YOU CAN TALK TO
AN IMMIGRATION OFFICER.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.814
BUT THAT CONVERSATION
TAKES PLACE

14:33.814 --> 14:35.483
WITH YOU
IN A COLORFUL JUMPSUIT

14:35.483 --> 14:37.618
UNDER HORRIBLE
FLUORESCENT LIGHTING

14:37.618 --> 14:41.088
AND YOUR DAUGHTER
IN FOSTER CARE.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.557
THAT'S THE PREDICAMENT.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.994
T.J. DIDN'T DO THIS.

14:46.994 --> 14:50.798
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN T.J.,
BRANDY.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.733
I WANT HIS FATHER.

15:24.570 --> 15:25.919
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD THIS?

15:25.919 --> 15:28.155
IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY
FOREVER.

15:28.155 --> 15:30.474
WELL,<i> MY</i> FAMILY,
NOT THE KARSTENS.

15:30.474 --> 15:32.794
MY DAD WAS RESTORING IT
WHEN HE DIED.

15:32.794 --> 15:34.630
I TOOK IT BACK UP
A FEW YEARS AGO.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.199
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL,
JACK.

15:37.199 --> 15:40.035
YEAH,
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

15:40.035 --> 15:42.704
I LIKE
A WORK IN PROGRESS.

15:42.704 --> 15:47.109
WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE...
YOU'RE THE FIRST VISITOR.

15:47.109 --> 15:50.545
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

15:50.545 --> 15:53.081
WELL,
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN HERE.

15:53.081 --> 15:55.417
IT'S JUST BEEN...MINE.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.253
IT'S NOT A SECRET,
EXACTLY, BUT...

15:58.253 --> 16:02.357
NOT SHARED -- UNTIL NOW.

16:06.561 --> 16:08.163
EXCUSE ME, MATE.

16:08.163 --> 16:09.698
COULD WE TROUBLE YOU
FOR SOME GLASSES?

16:09.698 --> 16:11.066
WENT ON A GROG RUN HERE.

16:11.066 --> 16:12.768
FORGOT SOMETHING
TO DRINK OUT OF.

16:12.768 --> 16:14.169
EH, SURE.
GLASSES, YEAH.

16:14.169 --> 16:15.270
I'LL CHECK DOWN BELOW.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.375
BEAUTIFUL BOAT.

16:27.949 --> 16:29.084
BERNIE.

16:29.084 --> 16:30.852
SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

16:30.852 --> 16:32.487
I ORDERED YOU
A MACALLAN, NEAT.

16:32.487 --> 16:34.990
WATER WILL BE JUST FINE.

16:34.990 --> 16:38.060
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BERNIE?

16:38.060 --> 16:39.961
YOU DODGING THE I.R.S.
AGAIN?

16:39.961 --> 16:41.330
I'VE HAD
ONE OF THOSE WEEKS.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.698
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?

16:42.698 --> 16:45.801
STRAIGHT TO BUSINESS?

16:45.801 --> 16:47.969
OKAY.

16:47.969 --> 16:50.305
I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE
WITH MY BANK.

16:50.305 --> 16:53.175
THEY SHUT DOWN THE FUNDING
ON THE STREETERVILLE PROJECT.

16:53.175 --> 16:56.778
SOME 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL
TOLD ME THE BANK WAS CONCERNED

16:56.778 --> 16:59.314
THE ZONING VOTE
MIGHT GET PUSHED.

16:59.314 --> 17:02.617
NOT MIGHT -- DID.

17:02.617 --> 17:03.985
THE VOTE IS OFF.

17:05.987 --> 17:08.357
BERNIE, I DID MY PART.

17:08.357 --> 17:09.558
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:09.558 --> 17:11.226
THATCHER,
THERE'S A LOT OF EYEBALLS

17:11.226 --> 17:12.761
EVER SINCE
YOUR KID GOT NABBED.

17:12.761 --> 17:15.397
HE WAS RELEASED THIS MORNING.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

17:15.397 --> 17:17.332
YOU DON'T GET IT.
THEY'RE SWARMING YOU.

17:17.332 --> 17:19.835
STATE'S ATTORNEY, THE FEDS,

17:19.835 --> 17:21.603
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE,
PROBABLY.

17:21.603 --> 17:23.638
THIS KID DREW STAFFORD
IS UP MY ASS.

17:23.638 --> 17:25.006
YEAH,
I KNOW ABOUT STAFFORD.

17:25.006 --> 17:26.675
HE NOT ONLY
WANTS TO SOLVE A MURDER.

17:26.675 --> 17:29.044
HE WANTS TO SAVE CHICAGO
FROM ITSELF.

17:29.044 --> 17:30.979
THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.

17:30.979 --> 17:33.482
AND BY THAT, HE MEANS
FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

17:33.482 --> 17:36.585
"PEOPLE LIKE ME"
MEANS "PEOPLE LIKE YOU."

17:36.585 --> 17:38.220
WHY ARE YOU SO SPOOKED

17:38.220 --> 17:41.256
BY SOME IVY-LEAGUE PISSANT
IN SUSPENDERS?

17:41.256 --> 17:43.425
STAY THE COURSE, BERNIE.

17:43.425 --> 17:46.595
SHOW A LITTLE LOYALTY
TO THE PEOPLE WHO GOT YOU HERE.

17:46.595 --> 17:47.996
THINGS HAVE CHANGED,

17:47.996 --> 17:51.600
AND IF I DON'T CHANGE WITH THEM,
I'M NOT GONNA SURVIVE.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.703
SO I'M SORRY. I-I CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH THIS THING.

17:57.806 --> 17:59.741
BERNIE.

17:59.741 --> 18:03.745
ALL THESE YEARS
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER,
DONE WORK TOGETHER --

18:03.745 --> 18:05.947
I WAS AT YOUR DAUGHTER'S
WEDDING, REMEMBER?

18:05.947 --> 18:09.284
I BUILT
YOUR DAMN SWIMMING POOL.

18:09.284 --> 18:13.088
YOU DO NOT WALK AWAY
FROM THIS TABLE.

18:13.088 --> 18:16.191
I CAN'T DO IT, THATCHER.

18:23.298 --> 18:25.634
SO, HOW LONG
ARE YOU GUYS HERE FOR?

18:25.634 --> 18:27.002
THE WHOLE SUMMER.

18:27.002 --> 18:28.570
YOUR SUMMER. OUR WINTER.

18:28.570 --> 18:30.639
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
YOUR WINTER. THAT
IS NOT A WINTER.

18:30.639 --> 18:32.340
OH.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.642
YOU LIVED IN AUSTRALIA?

18:33.642 --> 18:35.010
I DID.
YOU DID?

18:35.010 --> 18:37.245
I DID.
IN COLLEGE, JUNIOR YEAR.

18:37.245 --> 18:39.014
HOW DID I
NOT KNOW THIS?

18:39.014 --> 18:40.816
WELL, I GUESS
WE STILL HAVE A FEW SECRETS.

18:41.883 --> 18:43.418
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN TOGETHER?

18:45.520 --> 18:48.223
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE
JUST YESTERDAY.

18:48.223 --> 18:50.792
ALL RIGHT, SO,
WHERE'D YOU LIVE?

18:50.792 --> 18:54.329
MELBOURNE.
I AM SO SORRY.

18:54.329 --> 18:55.931
SYDNEY RIVALRY.

18:55.931 --> 18:57.232
NO, I LOVED IT.

18:57.232 --> 18:59.267
IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST TIMES
OF MY LIFE.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.570
IT'S WHERE I REALLY
GOT INTO PHOTOGRAPHY.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.505
AND BEER. YEAH.
AND BEER.

19:04.606 --> 19:06.842
YEAH, I DIDN'T
WANT TO COME BACK.

19:06.842 --> 19:09.277
SO, WHY DID YOU?

19:09.277 --> 19:12.280
OH, WELL,
THAT'S ANOTHER NIGHT

19:12.280 --> 19:13.682
AND ANOTHER TWO BOTTLES.

19:15.617 --> 19:17.586
HOW OFTEN DO YOU
TAKE THE BOAT OUT, MATE?

19:17.586 --> 19:20.422
UH, NOT VERY OFTEN.

19:20.422 --> 19:23.492
WELL, ACTUALLY, NEVER.

19:23.492 --> 19:24.860
NEVER?

19:24.860 --> 19:27.529
HOW DID I NOT
KNOW THIS ABOUT YOU?

19:29.164 --> 19:32.200
SKYLINE IS BRILLIANT
UP HERE.

19:40.609 --> 19:43.411
DIDN'T YOU EVER HEAR THE POEM,
CAPTAIN McALLISTER?

19:43.411 --> 19:45.313
A POEM?
YEAH.

19:45.313 --> 19:46.781
MY MOTHER
HAD IT ON THE WALL

19:46.781 --> 19:48.517
NEXT TO HER BED
WHEN I WAS A GIRL.

19:48.517 --> 19:52.053
"A SHIP IN HARBOR IS SAFE.

19:52.053 --> 19:55.924
BUT THAT IS NOT
WHAT SHIPS ARE BUILT FOR."

20:01.997 --> 20:05.033
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
COME ALONG, T.J.

20:05.033 --> 20:08.069
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU CALLED ME.

20:08.069 --> 20:11.172
YOU'RE LIKE FAMILY TO ME.

20:16.711 --> 20:18.113
OH, HERE HE IS.

20:22.984 --> 20:25.587
EVERYONE,
THIS IS BRANDY.
HI.

20:25.587 --> 20:26.888
BRANDY
WORKS AT PINTER'S.

20:26.888 --> 20:28.223
OH, WHAT'S PINTER'S?

20:28.223 --> 20:30.325
I-IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU ALL.

20:30.325 --> 20:31.860
I-I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.329
WHY WOULD YOU
BRING HER HERE?

20:34.329 --> 20:36.765
IT'S MY PARTY
AND SHE WANTED TO COME

20:36.765 --> 20:38.400
AND I WANTED HER
TO BE HERE.
T.J., THIS IS --

20:38.400 --> 20:41.836
T.J., IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU BACK HOME.

20:43.738 --> 20:46.074
HEY, MAN. TEEJ.

20:46.074 --> 20:47.542
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

20:47.542 --> 20:50.145
WELL,
OF COURSE I'M OKAY.

20:50.145 --> 20:51.880
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

20:55.417 --> 20:58.687
YOU KNOW, HE'S GONE
ALL THE TIME LATELY, DAD.

20:58.687 --> 21:01.289
I'M SURE HE'S NO HAPPIER
ABOUT IT THAN YOU ARE.

21:01.289 --> 21:03.825
TONIGHT WAS FOR T.J.

21:03.825 --> 21:05.894
ELAINE,
HE'S IN MICHIGAN

21:05.894 --> 21:08.330
WORKING TO
KEEP T.J. OUT OF JAIL.

21:08.330 --> 21:10.799
WE'RE HERE TONIGHT
<i>BECAUSE</i> OF JACK.

21:10.799 --> 21:14.302
SO CUT HIM A LITTLE SLACK.

21:21.810 --> 21:27.816
OKAY, UM,
I HAVE QUESTIONS.

21:27.816 --> 21:30.151
UM...

21:30.151 --> 21:32.287
DID YOU REALLY LIVE
IN MELBOURNE? IS THAT TRUE?

21:32.287 --> 21:34.623
IT'S 100% TRUE.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.759
ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

21:37.759 --> 21:39.861
OKAY.

21:39.861 --> 21:42.097
SERIOUS ONE.
MM-HMM.

21:42.097 --> 21:44.299
DO YOU REALLY
KNOW HOW TO SAIL?

21:44.299 --> 21:47.268
I THINK SO.

21:47.268 --> 21:50.171
LUCKILY, WE'LL
PROBABLY NEVER FIND OUT.

21:50.171 --> 21:51.906
OH, THAT'S SAD, JACK.

21:51.906 --> 21:56.011
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS OUT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

21:56.011 --> 21:59.114
ASK ME ANOTHER ONE --
A REAL ONE.

21:59.114 --> 22:00.949
ANYTHING.

22:03.852 --> 22:05.787
DO YOU EVER GET NERVOUS?

22:05.787 --> 22:07.022
RARELY.

22:07.022 --> 22:10.425
ARE YOU NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW?

22:10.425 --> 22:11.693
YES.

22:15.764 --> 22:17.966
DO YOU LIKE YOUR JOB?

22:19.768 --> 22:21.102
NO.

22:30.578 --> 22:33.415
ARE YOU HAPPILY MARRIED?

22:37.652 --> 22:40.789
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

22:40.789 --> 22:45.126
DO YOU EVER WISH THAT
WE'D NEVER MET?

22:45.126 --> 22:48.463
NO.

22:52.634 --> 22:54.769
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

22:54.769 --> 22:57.005
ASK ME ANYTHING.

23:06.081 --> 23:08.550
YES.

23:16.024 --> 23:19.327
ANOTHER ONE, PLEASE.

23:19.327 --> 23:23.331
DO YOU LIKE IT
WHEN I DO THIS?

23:38.413 --> 23:40.381
IT'S BRANDY, RIGHT?
OH!

23:42.717 --> 23:44.285
VAL.

23:44.285 --> 23:46.621
HI.

23:49.023 --> 23:51.559
SO, HOW DO YOU KNOW T.J.?
ARE YOU TWO...?

23:51.559 --> 23:53.194
WE'RE FRIENDS.

23:55.964 --> 23:58.299
AHA!
OH.

23:58.299 --> 23:59.300
WHAT IS IT?

23:59.300 --> 24:02.303
VAL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

24:02.303 --> 24:04.973
JUST TALKING --
TALKING TO BRANDY.

24:04.973 --> 24:08.109
TALK IN THE OTHER ROOM.

24:08.109 --> 24:10.378
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
NOT GONNA LIKE IT IF
YOU'RE IN HIS OFFICE.

24:13.448 --> 24:16.451
IT'S FROM MY PHONE,
I THINK.

24:16.451 --> 24:18.520
THANKS.

24:40.408 --> 24:42.143
JACK?

24:42.143 --> 24:44.879
JACK?

25:10.259 --> 25:13.596
WELL, APPARENTLY
YOU<i> DO</i> KNOW HOW TO SAIL.

25:15.064 --> 25:16.966
WELL, I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN US IN YET.

25:16.966 --> 25:19.135
WE HAVE TO GO IN?

25:19.135 --> 25:21.370
NOT NECESSARILY.

25:21.370 --> 25:25.074
OTHER OPTION IS TO GO DOWN
THE TENN-TOM WATERWAY,

25:25.074 --> 25:28.611
OVER TO FLORIDA,
UP THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD,

25:28.611 --> 25:31.747
DOWN THE ST. LAWRENCE,
ACROSS THE LAKES, AND BACK HERE.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.783
THAT'S THE GREAT LOOP.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.719
OR WE COULD JUST
HEAD SOUTH OF FLORIDA

25:36.719 --> 25:38.955
AND SAIL AROUND
THE CARIBBEAN --

25:38.955 --> 25:41.958
LIKE PIRATES.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.660
WOW. YOU'VE REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

25:44.660 --> 25:47.396
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
A LOT.

25:47.396 --> 25:48.898
ALL OF IT.

25:48.898 --> 25:51.367
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING
THIS BOAT OUT A THOUSAND TIMES,

25:51.367 --> 25:54.203
JUST THIS FAR, BUT...

25:54.203 --> 25:57.440
THERE WAS ALWAYS
SOME REASON NOT TO.

26:09.252 --> 26:11.120
THE ANSWER IS YES.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.823
TENN-TOM WATERWAY?
NO.

26:13.823 --> 26:17.360
THE OTHER QUESTION --
THE ONE THAT YOU ASKED
ME LAST NIGHT.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.962
THERE WAS
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

26:23.966 --> 26:28.437
I DO...LIKE IT.

26:28.437 --> 26:31.040
VERY MUCH.

26:43.452 --> 26:44.820
RODNEY?

26:44.820 --> 26:46.556
RODNEY IT IS.

26:46.556 --> 26:47.990
WHAT'S UP?

26:47.990 --> 26:51.227
I MET YOUR BROTHER
IN JAIL -- OMAR.

26:51.227 --> 26:53.396
HE HELPED ME.
HE WAS REALLY NICE TO ME.

26:53.396 --> 26:55.398
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE OMAR,

26:55.398 --> 26:57.767
BUT GOOD TO HEAR JAIL
IS HAVING A SALUTARY EFFECT.

27:00.169 --> 27:01.837
WAS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE?

27:01.837 --> 27:05.474
YOU USED A CAPRICE
REAR QUARTER PANEL HERE, HUH?

27:05.474 --> 27:07.243
THAT'S NOT A CAPRICE PANEL,
BOSS.

27:07.243 --> 27:10.046
WELL, THEY MIGHT HAVE
SOLD IT TO YOU AS A BEL AIR,

27:10.046 --> 27:12.014
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY
A CAPRICE.

27:12.014 --> 27:15.017
NOBODY SOLD IT TO
ME AS A BEL AIR, AND
IT'S NOT A CAPRICE.

27:15.017 --> 27:16.419
IT'S A 1971 --

27:16.419 --> 27:19.288
I KNOW. I KNOW.
1971 IMPALA.

27:19.288 --> 27:21.524
SMALL BLOCK 400.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.259
IT'S A NICE CAR.

27:23.259 --> 27:25.761
IMPALA REAR QUARTERS
ARE HARD TO COME BY,

27:25.761 --> 27:28.231
SO I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D USE A CAPRICE.

27:31.467 --> 27:35.037
DID<i> NOT</i> USE A CAPRICE.

27:35.037 --> 27:38.474
I HAVE A SECOND SERIES.

27:38.474 --> 27:42.612
1962 IMPALA SS409.

27:42.612 --> 27:44.847
IT'S ALL ORIGINAL,
BUT...

27:44.847 --> 27:48.150
I NEED A NEW BRIGHT DIP
ON THE GRILLE.

27:50.219 --> 27:52.321
OH, THERE WAS
SOMETHING ELSE.

27:52.321 --> 27:53.923
UH, YOUR BROTHER --

27:53.923 --> 27:56.792
HE WANTED ME TO
DELIVER A MESSAGE TO YOU.

27:56.792 --> 27:59.462
HE SAID HE COULDN'T
TELL YOU OVER THE PHONE.

27:59.462 --> 28:01.897
91-J.

28:01.897 --> 28:05.901
THAT'S WHAT HE
WANTED ME TO TELL YOU.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.070
YOU WANT TO
TAKE THIS FOR A RIDE?

28:09.472 --> 28:11.907
YOU A TRIPPY DUDE.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.109
I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.610
T.J.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.811
T.J. KARSTEN.

28:18.681 --> 28:19.849
HEY.

28:19.849 --> 28:22.251
HAVE A GOOD DAY, BUDDY.

28:26.055 --> 28:27.757
THATCHER KARSTEN.

28:27.757 --> 28:30.159
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
WE HAVE KIDS IN THE SAME CLASS.

28:30.159 --> 28:32.128
I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.996
I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD MEET.

28:33.996 --> 28:36.832
YEAH. THIS SEEMS LIKE
THE APPROPRIATE PLACE.

28:38.301 --> 28:42.004
YOU'RE A VERY TENACIOUS
YOUNG MAN, MR. STAFFORD.

28:42.004 --> 28:45.107
I WAS A TENACIOUS YOUNG MAN
MYSELF ONCE.

28:45.107 --> 28:46.475
A LONG TIME AGO.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.512
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
IN CHICAGO,

28:49.512 --> 28:51.714
AND IT'LL TAKE YOU
A LONG WAY.

28:51.714 --> 28:53.282
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
PICK YOUR BATTLES.

28:53.282 --> 28:56.452
THE BATTLES YOU CAN WIN.

28:56.452 --> 28:59.155
MY BUSINESS?

28:59.155 --> 29:02.158
MY SON?

29:02.158 --> 29:03.926
THESE ARE NOT SMART BATTLES.

29:03.926 --> 29:08.097
THESE BATTLES YOU CANNOT WIN,
MR. STAFFORD.

29:08.097 --> 29:11.634
THESE BATTLES
WILL DESTROY YOU.

29:14.403 --> 29:17.606
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A KID --

29:17.606 --> 29:20.576
ABOUT THE AGE
MY SON IS RIGHT NOW --

29:20.576 --> 29:22.712
I WAS
SCARED OF MONSTERS,

29:22.712 --> 29:25.281
ESPECIALLY MONSTERS
IN THE CLOSET.

29:25.281 --> 29:28.351
I WOULD ASK MY DAD
TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN,

29:28.351 --> 29:30.119
LIGHTS ON,
MUSIC PLAYING,

29:30.119 --> 29:32.154
ANYTHING
TO KEEP THE MONSTERS AWAY.

29:32.154 --> 29:34.056
THEN ONE DAY MY DAD,
HE JUST SAYS TO ME --

29:34.056 --> 29:37.660
HE SAYS,
"DREW, THESE MONSTERS --

29:37.660 --> 29:41.063
"IF THEY'RE REALLY
SO TOUGH AND SCARY,

29:41.063 --> 29:44.033
"WHY ARE THEY
PICKING ON LITTLE KIDS

29:44.033 --> 29:47.803
AND HIDING IN THE CLOSET?"

29:47.803 --> 29:50.973
I WAS NEVER
SCARED OF MONSTERS AGAIN.

29:50.973 --> 29:54.343
YOUR FATHER
WAS A CLEVER MAN.

29:54.343 --> 29:57.480
MY POINT BEING...

29:57.480 --> 30:00.683
YOU AREN'T THE THATCHER KARSTEN
THAT I GREW UP HEARING ABOUT.

30:00.683 --> 30:03.586
YOU'RE JUST A WORN-OUT GUY

30:03.586 --> 30:06.188
WAITING OUTSIDE
OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

30:06.188 --> 30:09.091
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE
AN ASSISTANT STATE'S ATTORNEY.

30:14.397 --> 30:17.767
LISTEN UP, SONNY.

30:17.767 --> 30:21.737
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS
TO GET LOST IN CHICAGO.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.274
MAKE SURE YOU GOT A MAP.

30:33.849 --> 30:37.453
JACK, I NEED TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

30:37.453 --> 30:40.756
OF COURSE, UM, ANYTHING.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.558
UH, JUST GIVE ME
TWO MINUTES.

30:42.558 --> 30:43.926
UH, THE HARBORMASTER
JUST SIGNALED ME.

30:43.926 --> 30:45.361
TWO MINUTES.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OKAY.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.334
HEY!

30:54.069 --> 30:55.771
EASY, KILLER.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.106
YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.707
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

30:58.707 --> 31:00.042
KARSTEN ASKED ME TO
LOOK INTO DREW STAFFORD,

31:00.042 --> 31:02.211
AND THAT LED ME HERE.

31:02.211 --> 31:05.114
SMALL WORLD,
YOU BANGING HIS WIFE.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.783
I'M NOT --
HEY,
I'M NOT JUDGING, JACK.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.619
BUT IT IS
A VERY INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.721
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ZAREK?

31:12.721 --> 31:15.257
SAME THING YOU WANT.

31:15.257 --> 31:17.226
SAME THING EVERYONE WANTS --
RESPECT.

31:17.226 --> 31:19.995
I'M FAMILY, JACK.
BLOOD.

31:19.995 --> 31:23.766
BUT THE OLD MAN, HE ONLY
CALLS ME FOR THESE ONE-OFFS.

31:23.766 --> 31:27.703
THAT'S JUST NOT UTILIZING
MY FULL SKILL SET.

31:27.703 --> 31:30.539
I WANT TO BE
A FULL MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

31:30.539 --> 31:32.241
T-THAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND THATCHER.

31:32.241 --> 31:34.810
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED NOW.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.579
DON'T THREATEN ME.

31:36.579 --> 31:38.514
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

31:38.514 --> 31:40.883
I'LL BE AROUND.

32:04.679 --> 32:07.615
HI, JACK.

32:07.615 --> 32:10.051
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

32:10.051 --> 32:11.664
LIKE, LITERALLY,
RIGHT NOW?

32:11.664 --> 32:13.533
DID YOU SLEEP OVER?

32:13.533 --> 32:15.568
WELL, IF I'M BEING
HONEST, THERE WASN'T
REALLY A LOT OF SLEEP.

32:15.568 --> 32:17.470
OKAY,
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

32:17.470 --> 32:18.805
I SAID A DATE.

32:18.805 --> 32:20.840
IT'S OKAY.
THIS IS NOT A DATE.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.743
NOTHING HAPPENED HERE.
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

32:23.743 --> 32:25.411
ALL RIGHT.
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.980
GIVE ME THAT.

32:34.654 --> 32:36.956
I REALLY LIKE HER,
YOU KNOW.

32:40.093 --> 32:43.429
THATCHER KARSTEN
OUTSIDE YOUR KID'S SCHOOL.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.765
MY DROP-OFFS
ARE NEVER THAT INTERESTING.

32:45.765 --> 32:48.001
HE'S FEELING THE HEAT, HE'S
GONNA START MAKING MISTAKES,

32:48.001 --> 32:49.335
AND I'LL BE THERE
WHEN HE DOES.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.838
YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS, AREN'T YOU?

32:51.838 --> 32:53.506
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

32:53.506 --> 32:56.409
A HOOKER INFORMANT PLANTING
A DEVICE AT KARSTEN ALLIED.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.678
IT'S INCREDIBLY RECKLESS.

32:58.678 --> 33:00.613
BIG RISK, BIG REWARD.

33:00.613 --> 33:03.950
NOW JUST TELL ME
THE WARRANT YOU HAVE
COVERS IT, PLEASE.

33:09.689 --> 33:11.024
WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

33:11.024 --> 33:12.725
CAN YOU NOT, WITH THE --
I-I'M JUST SAYING.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.494
WE JUST STAYED UP ALL NIGHT,
AND WE TALKED.

33:14.494 --> 33:16.262
VAL,
NO MORE SLEEPOVERS.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.631
NO SNEAKING...

33:18.631 --> 33:20.566
NO SNEAKING AROUND.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.702
NO LYING.

33:22.702 --> 33:24.404
I DIDN'T LIE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

33:24.404 --> 33:25.905
IF SHE COMES OVER AGAIN,

33:25.905 --> 33:28.241
IT'S DURING THE DAY
WHEN ONE OF US IS HOME.

33:30.910 --> 33:34.347
ALSO, YOU NEED TO SHOW HER
WHERE THE GLASSES ARE.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.892
DID THAT WORK?

33:45.892 --> 33:48.494
WELL, IT MIGHT KEEP
EVERYONE'S PANTS ON DOWNSTAIRS.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.430
BEYOND THAT, NO.

33:50.430 --> 33:52.732
AHH.

33:52.732 --> 33:55.535
YOU KNOW...
<i>WE</i> SNUCK AROUND.

33:55.535 --> 33:58.071
WE DID.

33:58.071 --> 33:59.839
AND LIED ABOUT IT.

34:13.953 --> 34:15.855
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING HERE?

34:15.855 --> 34:18.558
SOMETIMES THE VELVET GLOVE
WORKS, JACK.

34:18.558 --> 34:21.027
AND SOMETIMES
YOU NEED THE IRON FIST.

34:21.027 --> 34:22.895
STAY IN THE CAR, T.J.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.964
HEY, HEY.

34:24.964 --> 34:27.934
HEARD YOU SAILED RIGHT
THROUGH THE MICHIGAN
TRIP, JACK-O.

34:27.934 --> 34:30.436
YEAH, THANKS, ZAREK.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.772
YOU GOT ANYTHING
ON STAFFORD YET?

34:32.772 --> 34:36.109
WORKING ON IT.

34:36.109 --> 34:37.643
AH!

34:37.643 --> 34:40.513
THE HONORABLE
ALDERMAN BERNARD ARKOVICH!

34:40.513 --> 34:42.415
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE,
THATCHER?

34:42.415 --> 34:44.484
I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF CLEAR
YESTERDAY.

34:44.484 --> 34:45.952
OH, YOU DID, BERNIE.

34:45.952 --> 34:49.389
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT
YESTERDAY BEHIND US.

34:52.825 --> 34:54.627
BULLS-HEAT?

34:54.627 --> 34:57.797
ON THE FLOOR
WITH CLUB ACCESS.

34:57.797 --> 35:00.433
WE SHOULDN'T LET
ONE LITTLE BUMP

35:00.433 --> 35:03.870
SPOIL AN OTHERWISE
PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP.

35:03.870 --> 35:05.705
SO LONG AS
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

35:05.705 --> 35:08.408
OH, I THINK WE DO.

35:08.408 --> 35:12.111
COME ON. LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

35:13.913 --> 35:16.682
MY DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY
FALLING FOR CHICAGO

35:16.682 --> 35:19.452
IS LIKE FALLING FOR A GIRL
WITH A BROKEN NOSE.

35:19.452 --> 35:22.055
YOU MIGHT FIND OTHER GIRLS
WHO ARE LOVELIER

35:22.055 --> 35:24.424
BUT NEVER ONE SO REAL.

35:28.728 --> 35:30.963
I LOVE THIS VIEW.

35:30.963 --> 35:34.167
YOU CAN SEE
THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE CITY.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.868
MY LIFE.

35:35.868 --> 35:39.272
IT STARTED OVER THERE,
NOW IT'S HERE

35:39.272 --> 35:42.842
AND WITH ALL THE THINGS
I BUILT IN BETWEEN.

35:42.842 --> 35:44.777
THINGS<i> WE</i> BUILT, BERNIE.

35:44.777 --> 35:47.647
TOGETHER.

35:47.647 --> 35:49.749
YOU KNOW
THAT SANDBURG QUOTE?

35:49.749 --> 35:53.119
"SHOVELING, WRECKING,
PLANNING,

35:53.119 --> 35:58.291
BUILDING, BREAKING,
REBUILDING."

35:58.291 --> 36:02.695
I'M NOT READY
TO GIVE THAT UP.

36:02.695 --> 36:05.064
I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE THAT UP.

36:06.599 --> 36:10.369
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE VOTE,
MAYBE I --

36:10.369 --> 36:12.705
<i>WE</i> CAN SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO.

36:12.705 --> 36:15.875
MAYBE WE COULD
DO SOMETHING,

36:15.875 --> 36:18.444
MAYBE GO AT IT
ANOTHER WAY.

36:18.444 --> 36:22.148
THAT'S ALL I WAS SAYING,
THAT TIMES CHANGE, THATCHER.

36:22.148 --> 36:24.450
THAT'S ALL I WAS SAYING.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.587
THAT'S GOOD.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.591
THATCHER, DON'T!

36:38.898 --> 36:42.168
SOME THINGS CHANGE,
BERNIE.

36:42.168 --> 36:44.837
BUT CHICAGO...

36:50.176 --> 36:52.445
...CHICAGO NEVER CHANGES.

36:54.013 --> 36:56.482
YOU SON OF A...

37:03.228 --> 37:04.864
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO DO BUSINESS.

37:04.864 --> 37:06.280
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
<i>WE</i> DO BUSINESS.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.616
HOW DO WE DO BUSINESS,
JACK?

37:08.616 --> 37:11.816
NOT BY FAILING,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

37:11.816 --> 37:13.410
YOU MAY NOT LIKE
HOW I DO IT,

37:13.410 --> 37:15.645
BUT IT WORKS -- ALWAYS.

37:15.645 --> 37:17.581
YOUR WAY IS TOO SOFT.

37:17.581 --> 37:18.982
IT'S -- IT'S FLABBY.

37:18.982 --> 37:22.052
MAKE A FEW CALLS,
SEND OVER SOME ENVELOPES,

37:22.052 --> 37:23.553
BUY A FEW DRINKS.

37:23.553 --> 37:26.123
HOPE EVERYONE ACTS NICE --
VERY NICE --

37:26.123 --> 37:29.025
WHILE THEY
THROW YOUR SON IN PRISON

37:29.025 --> 37:32.028
AND TRY TO DESTROY
EVERYTHING YOU EVER WORKED FOR.

37:32.028 --> 37:33.730
THATCHER,
YOU CROSSED A LINE.

37:33.730 --> 37:36.466
NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME,
JACK.

37:36.466 --> 37:38.435
AND DON'T PRETEND
YOU DON'T KNOW IT.

37:38.435 --> 37:43.373
BERNIE ARKOVICH IS A THIEF,
A LIAR, AND A LUSH.

37:43.373 --> 37:46.443
HE'D NAIL YOU TO THE WALL
FOR A NEW TOILET SEAT

37:46.443 --> 37:50.013
IF HE WASN'T TOO SLOW
AND TOO STUPID TO PULL IT OFF.

37:52.082 --> 37:54.151
OKAY, SO,
YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT HAPPENED.

37:54.151 --> 37:55.552
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T LIKE IT, EITHER.

37:55.552 --> 37:57.320
IT DIDN'T "HAPPEN."
YOU DID IT.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.356
BUT WHAT I LIKE EVEN LESS

37:59.356 --> 38:02.192
IS SOME PUTZ THINKING
HE CAN PLAY ME

38:02.192 --> 38:04.494
WITH IMPUNITY!

38:07.664 --> 38:11.568
NOW, ABOUT THIS PROSECUTOR
DREW STAFFORD --

38:11.568 --> 38:13.437
WHAT DO WE GOT ON HIM?

38:30.787 --> 38:33.290
WHY IS THIS DOG
HANGING AROUND HERE, MAN?

38:33.290 --> 38:36.359
'CAUSE IT'S MY GARAGE
AND I LIKE HIM.

38:38.094 --> 38:40.730
THE MESSAGE FROM OMAR --
91-J.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.466
91st AND JACKSON.

38:42.466 --> 38:45.001
ALL KIND OF CASH
GOING THROUGH THERE RIGHT NOW.

38:45.001 --> 38:48.071
IT'S THE PLACE TO HIT, MAN.
GOT TO DO IT NOW.

38:48.071 --> 38:52.209
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED
IN OMAR'S BUSINESS ANYMORE.

38:59.850 --> 39:02.185
THIS TRUNK
LOOKS LIKE CRAP.

39:02.185 --> 39:05.288
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
PUT A CAPRICE LID ON THIS ONE?

39:05.288 --> 39:08.024
CAPRICE DIDN'T EXIST
IN 1962, RODNEY.

39:08.024 --> 39:11.328
THEY STARTED IN '65,
I'M SURE.

39:35.952 --> 39:37.821
HOLA!

39:37.821 --> 39:39.256
I-I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

39:39.256 --> 39:41.558
HOW WAS THE TRIP?
WHOA.

39:41.558 --> 39:43.793
DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE GOING TO THE BAHAMAS.

39:43.793 --> 39:46.129
W-WE WERE SHOOTING
OUTSIDE.

39:46.129 --> 39:47.597
OUTSIDE, HUH?

39:47.597 --> 39:50.166
THAT'S A WEIRD PLACE
TO GET A SUNBURN.

39:53.370 --> 39:56.473
I GOT YA. RELAX.

40:01.478 --> 40:03.346
STAFFORD'S WIFE?

40:03.346 --> 40:06.550
YEAH.
SHE'S SCREWING SOME LOSER.

40:06.550 --> 40:09.653
STAFFORD'S WIFE
IS HAVING AN AFFAIR?

40:09.653 --> 40:12.055
PRETTY HOT AND HEAVY,
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL.

40:12.055 --> 40:14.591
WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

40:16.860 --> 40:19.195
WE DON'T KNOW.

40:19.195 --> 40:21.598
WE?
YEAH, ZAREK AND I,

40:21.598 --> 40:25.235
WE'VE BEEN TALKING,
WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER.

40:25.235 --> 40:27.370
ACTUALLY, IN FACT,
I THINK THAT

40:27.370 --> 40:31.508
WE NEED TO INVOLVE HIM MORE
IN OUR BUSINESS.

40:31.508 --> 40:34.144
YOU DO?

40:35.879 --> 40:38.281
OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC,

40:38.281 --> 40:41.518
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THINKING
THE SAME THING.

40:43.753 --> 40:46.489
WELL, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN GET
ON THE BOYFRIEND.

40:46.489 --> 40:48.592
PROBABLY JUST
SOME POOR JERK-OFF

40:48.592 --> 40:50.927
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GETTING HIMSELF INTO.

40:54.965 --> 40:59.169
SARA, I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING SOMEONE.

41:01.371 --> 41:05.241
I KNOW ABOUT
THE THERAPIST.

41:05.241 --> 41:09.312
THE OFFICE CALLED
TO CONFIRM YOUR APPOINTMENT.

41:09.312 --> 41:12.048
ACTUALLY,
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

41:12.048 --> 41:13.984
YOU DO?

41:13.984 --> 41:15.585
I DO.

41:15.585 --> 41:18.388
YOU'VE SEEMED A LITTLE...
TENSE LATELY.

41:19.556 --> 41:22.425
HOME RUN, DAD! HOME RUN!

41:22.425 --> 41:25.095
APPARENTLY,
THERE'S A HOME RUN.

41:25.095 --> 41:27.864
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS
SOME MORE.

41:27.864 --> 41:29.866
OH, I GOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT
A RUN-IN I HAD

41:29.866 --> 41:32.035
WITH THATCHER KARSTEN
OUTSIDE OF OLLIE'S SCHOOL.

41:32.035 --> 41:33.703
TOTAL WAR
WITH THESE GUYS.

41:35.038 --> 41:38.274
FIND OUT WHO THIS GUY IS
SHE'S SCREWING.

41:38.274 --> 41:41.111
WE CAN USE HIM,
DISGRACE THE GOOD COUNSELOR

41:41.111 --> 41:42.445
RIGHT OUT OF OUR WAY.

41:46.383 --> 41:47.984
I KNOW YOU'RE
UNCOMFORTABLE

41:47.984 --> 41:49.786
WITH SOME OF THESE TACTICS,
JACK.

41:52.922 --> 41:55.892
BUT YOU GOT TO TRUST ME.

41:58.094 --> 42:01.364
<i>WE'RE IN</i>
<i>A NEW SITUATION HERE.</i>

42:01.364 --> 42:04.167
<i>WE HAD A GOOD DAY,</i>
<i>BUT IT'S NOT OVER --</i>

42:04.167 --> 42:06.269
<i>NOT BY A LONG SHOT.</i>

42:06.269 --> 42:11.408
THEY BROUGHT THE BATTLE
TO US, SO...

42:11.408 --> 42:14.477
THIS IS WAR.
