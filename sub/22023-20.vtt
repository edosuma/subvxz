00:00.094 --> 00:03.797
That's the face, nose,
and that's the mouth.

00:03.799 --> 00:06.703
It has a mouth! Oh, great.

00:06.907 --> 00:09.337
Nobody does a fail video
quite like a Russian.

00:09.338 --> 00:11.437
Dina, take a look. It's perfect.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.070
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Do you want to see it in 4-D?

00:15.071 --> 00:16.343
- Really?
- Okay.

00:17.686 --> 00:20.180
What the [bleep]?

00:20.600 --> 00:23.840
- Oh, it's a miracle.
- Uh-huh.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.251
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

00:30.025 --> 00:32.067
The doctor says it's
normal for the head to be

00:32.067 --> 00:33.968
so much bigger than
the rest of the body.

00:33.969 --> 00:35.518
I've heard that successful people

00:35.520 --> 00:38.321
have unusually large heads.
Look at the Burger King.

00:38.323 --> 00:38.768
Hmm.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.106
Could they tell the sex?

00:40.108 --> 00:42.599
Well, the doctor wrote it down

00:42.600 --> 00:46.461
and put it in this envelope,
so here goes nothing.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.821
Wait. You're gonna
just do that right here?

00:49.822 --> 00:51.400
You guys should do something special.

00:51.403 --> 00:53.052
Jerry's whole family
came to the hospital

00:53.054 --> 00:54.604
for his catheter removal.

00:54.606 --> 00:56.306
The doctor even let his
mom hold his penis

00:56.308 --> 00:57.740
while the nurse pulled out the tube.

00:58.043 --> 00:59.908
- Oh.
- Or, we could get a cake,

00:59.911 --> 01:01.082
and then, when you slice into it,

01:01.083 --> 01:02.345
it's either pink or blue.

01:02.347 --> 01:04.501
Or we could all get paintball guns,

01:04.503 --> 01:05.882
and shoot each other, and the paint

01:05.884 --> 01:07.317
could either be blue or pink.

01:07.319 --> 01:10.486
So we'd all be like, ah, ooh, it hurts,

01:10.488 --> 01:12.288
but you guys would like, ha ha.

01:14.226 --> 01:15.658
It's a girl, bitch.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.765
Funny to think
that it has genitals, right?

01:18.630 --> 01:21.054
It's like, I could have
a stranger's tiny penis

01:21.055 --> 01:23.236
just whipping around inside me.

01:23.401 --> 01:24.868
Sounds like my Saturday night.

01:26.988 --> 01:28.771
So what do you think? Is it gonna be

01:28.773 --> 01:32.942
- a Glenn or a Glenda?
- Ugh, Glenda would be rough.

01:32.944 --> 01:34.967
If I was a boy, I was gonna be Donald.

01:34.968 --> 01:36.813
Donald?

01:36.815 --> 01:38.698
- Yeah.
- It just sounds like,

01:38.960 --> 01:42.085
I'm Don Sosa, and have
I got a car for you.

01:42.087 --> 01:46.089
Um, more like, and up next,
batting for the Cardinals,

01:46.091 --> 01:48.892
- number 34, Don Sosa!
- Oh, no, no way.

01:48.894 --> 01:50.510
I'm-a Don-a Sosa.

01:50.512 --> 01:53.875
Please come to my villa
so I may make-a love to you.

01:53.876 --> 01:55.732
But I work at the Cloud 9.

01:55.734 --> 01:57.867
- Yes.
- So we go to my

01:57.869 --> 01:59.919
tiny apartment, we make the love...

01:59.921 --> 02:01.571
You come visit me, do not worry,

02:01.573 --> 02:03.940
do not you worry,
you sit-a on-a my twin bed.

02:03.942 --> 02:05.508
I'm-a make-a my roommate go away,

02:05.510 --> 02:07.977
- he don't even looking.
- Makea the love many times

02:07.979 --> 02:11.479
- on the coupons.
- I give you half off the love making.

02:13.735 --> 02:15.318
All right, I should get back to...

02:15.320 --> 02:18.289
- I should go find Kelly.
- You guys doing funny accents?

02:18.590 --> 02:20.226
I am not a crook.

02:20.809 --> 02:21.873
Ronald Reagan.

02:24.095 --> 02:26.533
Uh, excuse me?
Are you pregnant or just fat?

02:27.469 --> 02:28.731
- Pregnant.
- Okay, good.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.167
Uh, quick question,
do you have any feelings of,

02:31.169 --> 02:34.003
I don't know, overwhelming
panic and a desire to flee?

02:34.005 --> 02:35.485
- Is that your first?
- Yeah.

02:35.486 --> 02:36.839
Well, technically it's not mine.

02:36.841 --> 02:39.309
- It's my boss's.
- Uh, okay.

02:39.311 --> 02:42.512
Uh, little advice. Get the C-section.

02:42.514 --> 02:45.048
With my first, I was
in labor for 36 hours.

02:45.050 --> 02:47.364
Finally, I bit off part
of my tongue, I passed out...

02:47.365 --> 02:49.619
Sorry, didn't mean to eavesdrop,

02:49.621 --> 02:52.789
but I had a C-section. Not great.

02:53.033 --> 02:54.857
They couldn't get my
uterus back in after,

02:54.859 --> 02:57.950
and they had to just keep
shoving and punching it in

02:58.200 --> 03:00.296
- like an overstuffed duffel.
- I had to have twins.

03:00.298 --> 03:02.265
Breech birth, in the back of an Altima.

03:02.267 --> 03:04.467
Some EMT cut me from hole to hole.

03:04.877 --> 03:07.439
Nope. Nope. Absolutely not.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.941
Justine, we need pink and blue balloons.

03:09.942 --> 03:11.557
Heather, you're on mason jars.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.088
And Sandra, I need you
to make a melon baby.

03:14.596 --> 03:17.814
- What's a melon baby?
- You know, a melon baby.

03:17.816 --> 03:20.297
- I can do it if Sandra can't.
- No, no, I can do it.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.881
- I'll do it.
- Great. Any questions?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.119
Okay, break.

03:28.586 --> 03:30.226
- Guess who?
- Oh, hey, Jeff.

03:30.228 --> 03:33.680
- Ah, well, Jonah ruined it.
- Hey.

03:33.682 --> 03:35.064
What are you doing here?

03:35.065 --> 03:36.538
Oh, I'm on a break from Target.

03:36.539 --> 03:37.900
Thought I would stop by and say hi.

03:37.902 --> 03:39.555
- How's your new job?
- Oh, at Target?

03:39.556 --> 03:41.137
Well, it's Target. It's the big leagues.

03:41.139 --> 03:43.239
Well, uh, thank you for visiting.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.041
It was good seeing you, but these carts

03:45.043 --> 03:46.909
aren't gonna put themselves away, so.

03:46.911 --> 03:49.962
Oh, uh, okay, well, then
I'm going to do a little

03:49.964 --> 03:52.982
shopping for supper.
Don't tell the folks at Target.

03:52.984 --> 03:56.043
I'm kidding, they don't need
my business, they're Target.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.125
Everything okay with you guys?

04:02.127 --> 04:05.094
Yep, yeah, just spending
a lot of time together.

04:05.096 --> 04:06.963
Really? I feel like managing a Target

04:06.965 --> 04:09.532
- would take a lot of time...
- He doesn't work at Target.

04:09.534 --> 04:12.001
Okay, he didn't even make it
past the phone interview.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.203
Wait, he's been lying?

04:14.205 --> 04:16.272
He's been too embarrassed

04:16.274 --> 04:18.007
to admit he's unemployed. Just because

04:18.009 --> 04:19.675
Kathy, no, I can't come in early.

04:19.677 --> 04:22.995
Just handle it yourself or
consult the Target handbook.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.714
It's work.

04:25.650 --> 04:29.452
They cut off his cell phone
service a month ago, so.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.327
No, no, we're not doing that.
We're not doing that.

04:38.329 --> 04:39.862
We're not doing that.
We're not doing that.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.748
We're not doing that.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.433
Take this, it's just sitting
there, tempting me like a redhead.

04:45.435 --> 04:46.615
Uh, sure.

04:46.864 --> 04:49.539
Under no circumstances let me see

04:49.541 --> 04:51.130
what's inside that envelope.

04:51.910 --> 04:54.945
This is a terrible,
wonderful responsibility.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.745
Can I see what's in that envelope?

04:59.384 --> 05:01.662
- No.
- Wow, you're good.

05:02.921 --> 05:05.138
<i>It's been a difficult birth.</i>

05:05.140 --> 05:07.023
<i>The mother has lost a lot of blood.</i>

05:07.025 --> 05:09.525
<i>And the pain is unbearable.</i>

05:09.527 --> 05:11.561
<i>The farmer moves in to put her down.</i>

05:11.563 --> 05:14.197
- Jesus.
- Dina, some of the customers

05:14.199 --> 05:16.358
are asking if we can change the channel.

05:16.568 --> 05:18.301
Oh.

05:18.303 --> 05:21.104
<i>The farmer is unsuccessful
on his first try.</i>

05:21.106 --> 05:22.738
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.874
Hey, Glenn, need to talk to you
when you have a minute.

05:25.206 --> 05:26.542
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, no.

05:26.544 --> 05:28.111
They just sent us the
wrong receipt paper again,

05:28.113 --> 05:30.313
and I also decided I no longer
want to carry your baby,

05:30.315 --> 05:32.112
so we'll just go over all that.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.983
The baby's in a sack anyway.
I'm just suggesting

05:37.984 --> 05:40.384
we take out that sack,
and stuff it into someone else.

05:40.385 --> 05:41.170
Maybe Sandra.

05:41.171 --> 05:42.719
Yeah, I don't think
that technology exists.

05:42.721 --> 05:43.814
What technology?

05:44.156 --> 05:45.739
I'm talking about moving
a bag of garbage

05:45.741 --> 05:46.964
from the kitchen
to the side of the house.

05:46.965 --> 05:48.402
Bag of garbage?

05:48.403 --> 05:50.044
You can't just move it.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.212
It's attached to things.

05:52.214 --> 05:53.714
Fine, fine, that's just one idea.

05:53.716 --> 05:55.048
We can come up with something else.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.707
- What is going on?
- It's okay.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.670
- Dina, I know this is scary...
- Okay, okay, how about this?

05:59.672 --> 06:01.221
We induce a coma, okay? In five months,

06:01.223 --> 06:03.247
I wake up empty and happy
and everybody wins.

06:04.893 --> 06:06.510
All right, don't just say no, all right?

06:06.512 --> 06:08.679
We can find a solution.
We just have to keep talking

06:08.681 --> 06:10.180
until we figure something out.

06:12.818 --> 06:15.168
Hey, Garrett. We need the envelope.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.343
Glenn said he gave it to you.

06:16.345 --> 06:18.939
We're gonna fill this piñata
with either pink or blue candy.

06:18.941 --> 06:21.358
So people are gonna
beat that baby with a stick

06:21.360 --> 06:23.944
till it bursts open and
spews candy guts everywhere?

06:23.946 --> 06:25.843
Yep, that's what I said too.

06:26.582 --> 06:28.457
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

06:33.706 --> 06:35.839
- Did you lose it?
- No.

06:35.841 --> 06:37.075
Why do you sound nervous?

06:37.076 --> 06:39.262
Why do you sound like a cartoon mouse?

06:39.628 --> 06:41.184
It's funny.

06:42.347 --> 06:45.110
Hey, is this the only
gumbo mix you have?

06:45.434 --> 06:46.742
- I think so.
- Mmm.

06:47.269 --> 06:49.720
You know, at Target,
the selection is just,

06:49.722 --> 06:51.685
Mind blowing.

06:51.686 --> 06:53.140
I mean, that's why we call it Target.

06:53.142 --> 06:54.391
That's what everybody's aiming for.

06:54.993 --> 06:55.859
It's a nice store.

06:55.861 --> 06:57.527
There's this guy I work
with named Gordon,

06:57.529 --> 07:00.030
who reminds me so much of you.
The other day, I was like,

07:00.032 --> 07:02.543
"Hey, Jordan", like I combined
your name and his name.

07:02.544 --> 07:04.856
- God, did we laugh, oh.
- That's funny.

07:05.204 --> 07:08.501
Um, you know, you don't have to
talk about the job so much.

07:11.794 --> 07:13.194
Why would you tell Jeff what I said?

07:13.195 --> 07:15.912
I didn't, he's just really
good at reading people.

07:15.914 --> 07:18.165
Like, not psychic, but he's operating

07:18.167 --> 07:19.166
on a very high level.

07:19.168 --> 07:21.668
Well, now he feels
even worse about himself.

07:21.670 --> 07:24.573
So why don't you just encourage
him to get back out there?

07:24.575 --> 07:26.590
Okay, he quit his job for me.

07:26.592 --> 07:29.226
I can't be the one who
criticizes him for not working.

07:29.228 --> 07:31.626
I guess I could try talking
to him, if you want.

07:32.931 --> 07:35.466
Oh, well, I mean, he does respect you.

07:36.602 --> 07:38.068
But you can't sleep with him.

07:38.070 --> 07:40.878
Yeah, no, I will try and control myself.

07:41.356 --> 07:42.082
Okay.

07:44.491 --> 07:47.110
The name is Glenn and Jerusha Sturgis.

07:47.112 --> 07:49.208
I need to know the gender of their baby.

07:49.832 --> 07:51.803
Okay, sure, one second.

07:54.870 --> 07:57.587
Hello, it's me, Glenn Sturgis.

07:57.589 --> 08:00.328
I seem to have lost the
envelope the doctor wrote

08:00.328 --> 08:02.446
the gender of my little angel in and...

08:03.064 --> 08:04.088
What?

08:04.135 --> 08:05.679
That's exactly how he sounds.

08:05.681 --> 08:07.633
You have no idea how spot on I was.

08:08.767 --> 08:10.133
I did not think this through.

08:10.135 --> 08:12.064
And now, I have a horrible parasite

08:12.143 --> 08:13.751
just eating and pissing inside me.

08:13.752 --> 08:15.806
My friend Corona swallowed a tape worm

08:15.808 --> 08:18.393
to lose weight,
and it ate one of her organs.

08:19.462 --> 08:21.162
She looked really good at prom, though.

08:21.211 --> 08:23.549
Look, Dina, it's just
for a few more months.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.232
Yeah, and then I get to endure

08:25.234 --> 08:27.150
the most gruesome pain imaginable.

08:27.152 --> 08:30.048
The phrase "cut from hole
to hole" was said to me.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.496
You know, it really
didn't hurt that much.

08:32.514 --> 08:34.905
I remember thinking, like, big whoop.

08:35.534 --> 08:37.168
Way to over-hype it, women.

08:37.296 --> 08:39.780
Really? 'Cause for me, it was like...

08:40.332 --> 08:44.968
- It was... it was like nothing.
- Yeah, it was like bad cramps.

08:44.970 --> 08:47.812
Yeah, or like pooping,
with blood and screaming

08:47.813 --> 08:49.743
and then a face comes out of you.

08:50.884 --> 08:53.176
It's like, what else are you
telling people about me?

08:53.178 --> 08:54.971
Hey, guys. Hey, Jeff.

08:55.764 --> 08:57.347
You don't have to say my name that way.

08:57.349 --> 08:58.480
I know what I am.

08:58.481 --> 09:01.184
I wasn't saying it like anything.

09:01.389 --> 09:04.187
And besides, you just need to
get back out there, you know?

09:04.189 --> 09:05.999
Get back on the horse. Giddy-up!

09:06.775 --> 09:08.737
- Cowboy.
- Yes, but, I mean...

09:10.863 --> 09:14.407
I've never asked myself
what I want to do with my life.

09:14.408 --> 09:16.283
And I just thought, you know,
now that I have this

09:16.285 --> 09:18.680
opportunity, maybe I
could figure that out

09:18.804 --> 09:22.005
instead of just jumping into
the first job that comes along.

09:22.007 --> 09:24.306
Is that so wrong? To just once ask

09:24.877 --> 09:26.593
what makes Jeffrey happy?

09:28.931 --> 09:30.347
No.

09:30.349 --> 09:33.141
You shouldn't rush into anything.
You should...

09:33.143 --> 09:34.280
follow your bliss.

09:35.103 --> 09:37.354
Yeah, defin... definitely.
You'll find another job.

09:37.356 --> 09:39.797
You just... you need
to figure out you first.

09:40.156 --> 09:41.725
You were supposed
to tell him to get a job.

09:41.727 --> 09:42.976
But then he said all that stuff,

09:42.978 --> 09:44.444
and you told him to follow his bliss.

09:44.446 --> 09:46.029
Because I'm not supposed
to be the bad cop.

09:46.031 --> 09:47.447
- That was your job.
- I'm sorry.

09:47.449 --> 09:50.066
You seemed on board. It's called acting.

09:50.068 --> 09:51.534
Okay, when you watch
"Terms of Endearment,"

09:51.536 --> 09:53.299
Debra Winger doesn't
actually have cancer.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.879
I haven't seen it yet. It's on my list.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.323
But I still have a lot
of TV to get through.

09:56.325 --> 09:58.491
We're in a golden age of television.

09:59.995 --> 10:02.545
Look, last month,
I thought I might be pregnant.

10:02.547 --> 10:05.131
I had missed a few periods, and
I was gaining some weight...

10:05.133 --> 10:07.300
Oh, no way, you were gaining weight?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.419
I didn't even notice.

10:09.421 --> 10:11.054
What, are you blind? Look at her.

10:11.056 --> 10:13.924
Anyway, I took the test,

10:13.926 --> 10:16.735
and while I was waiting,
I kind of realized

10:17.755 --> 10:19.450
I kind of wanted to be pregnant again.

10:19.451 --> 10:21.431
Oh, yeah, 'cause Emma's a dud.

10:21.433 --> 10:22.575
No. What?

10:22.768 --> 10:25.181
Right, no, JK, she's my fave.

10:25.938 --> 10:28.897
Because I remembered
how amazing it felt.

10:28.898 --> 10:31.769
It's like, you're carrying this life.

10:32.110 --> 10:34.527
You're a god. I don't know,

10:34.529 --> 10:37.113
I was kind of sad when I
got just the one cloud.

10:37.115 --> 10:39.338
- You took a Supercloud test?
- Yeah.

10:39.746 --> 10:41.029
Did you not read the memo?

10:41.156 --> 10:42.557
They recalled all the Supercloud tests

10:42.558 --> 10:44.081
after a bunch of false negatives.

10:44.082 --> 10:46.527
The Midwest is drowning
in blooper babies.

10:49.343 --> 10:50.405
Excuse me.

10:53.849 --> 10:55.939
Probably trying to get her money back.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.492
I know it's probably
not the best timing, but...

11:03.798 --> 11:06.099
this is why you need to read the memos.

11:08.587 --> 11:10.931
Look at it this way, you said you
wanted to be pregnant again.

11:10.933 --> 11:12.011
I was obviously lying.

11:12.012 --> 11:14.275
No one wants to be pregnant.
It's terrible.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.392
Okay, first things first,

11:16.394 --> 11:17.827
let's figure out who the father is.

11:17.829 --> 11:19.729
All right, let's make a
list of all the people

11:19.731 --> 11:21.504
you've had sex with
over the last few months.

11:21.505 --> 11:24.434
Oh, Alex, Tate, write small,
there could be dozens.

11:24.436 --> 11:26.005
It's not either one of them.

11:27.606 --> 11:31.067
I was taking it slow with Alex,
and I almost had sex with Tate.

11:31.068 --> 11:32.560
He started doing one-armed pushups,

11:32.561 --> 11:34.544
and he fell and got
embarrassed, and so he left.

11:34.546 --> 11:36.496
He said he had a meeting,
but it was like 2:00 a.m.

11:36.498 --> 11:38.087
So then, who?

11:39.551 --> 11:42.102
- It was Adam.
- Dubanowski?

11:42.220 --> 11:43.586
Isn't he dating someone?

11:43.588 --> 11:45.455
Yeah, they broke up a couple months ago.

11:45.457 --> 11:47.090
She broke up with him, though, right?

11:47.092 --> 11:48.625
It's the only scenario
where it makes sense.

11:48.627 --> 11:50.893
He came over to pick up some stuff,

11:50.895 --> 11:53.525
and we were both feeling
a little lonely, so,

11:53.869 --> 11:57.300
we started drinking.
Then we started laughing

11:57.302 --> 11:59.118
and talking about the good old days,

11:59.120 --> 12:00.820
and he was wearing an Obama T-shirt,

12:00.822 --> 12:02.749
and I just miss Obama so much.

12:03.141 --> 12:05.823
Wow, it's like, thanks, Obama.

12:06.411 --> 12:09.584
Funny to think I was the one
who was freaking out before.

12:10.527 --> 12:12.482
You know what? It doesn't matter.

12:13.304 --> 12:14.884
Guys, come on, it's just an envelope.

12:14.886 --> 12:16.864
- It's got to be somewhere.
- Oh, look.

12:17.555 --> 12:18.798
I found my retainer.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.692
- Oh.
- Ah, it doesn't fit.

12:22.894 --> 12:24.396
My teeth must have shifted.

12:24.929 --> 12:27.697
Again, let's stop looking for treasure,

12:27.699 --> 12:29.272
and find the envelope.

12:31.242 --> 12:33.946
- What is he wearing?
- Looks like hiking gear.

12:34.339 --> 12:36.856
- I'll say something to him.
- Yes, but remember.

12:36.858 --> 12:39.135
- Bad cop, good cop.
- I've done plays.

12:39.135 --> 12:40.127
What do you think, huh?

12:40.128 --> 12:41.610
Hey, check out how light these are.

12:41.613 --> 12:44.047
Carbon fiber... sorry, they're
probably a little sweaty.

12:44.049 --> 12:47.219
Nice, uh, are we outside people now?

12:47.719 --> 12:50.102
- Investing in gear?
- Yeah, treat myself.

12:50.422 --> 12:52.021
Hey, here's a question:
how are you gonna

12:52.023 --> 12:54.957
- pay for all that without a job?
- Uh, I have savings.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.182
Well, he's a grown man.

12:56.183 --> 12:58.231
He can spend his money how he wants.

12:58.630 --> 13:01.698
Yeah, well, he's just gonna blow through

13:01.700 --> 13:04.600
all those savings before you
know it, and then what, huh?

13:04.602 --> 13:06.736
- You just gonna be a bum?
- Uh, I don't think

13:06.738 --> 13:08.838
- I'm gonna be a bum...
- Okay, you know what?

13:08.840 --> 13:11.441
I think it's time I drop a
little truth bomb on you, okay?

13:11.443 --> 13:13.843
You're a grown man.
You're too young to retire,

13:13.845 --> 13:16.512
and you're way too old
to start mountain climbing,

13:16.514 --> 13:19.749
or whatever this is, so
snap out of it, okay, bub?

13:19.751 --> 13:22.160
Grow up, get a job, and be a man.

13:22.582 --> 13:25.321
Kapow! Truth bomb!

13:25.323 --> 13:27.757
Who the hell are you
to talk to him that way?

13:27.758 --> 13:29.492
He is more man than you'll ever be.

13:29.494 --> 13:30.589
- What?
- If we're talking about

13:30.590 --> 13:32.261
truth bombs, well, take shelter,

13:32.263 --> 13:33.975
'cause I'm about to make it rain.

13:34.399 --> 13:37.633
Hey, Adam, it's Amy. Um, give me a call.

13:37.635 --> 13:41.445
I have a story to tell you.
It's kind of a long story.

13:41.756 --> 13:43.823
That ends with a baby. Our baby.

13:43.825 --> 13:45.286
Nope, re-record.

13:45.287 --> 13:48.444
Hey Adam, who has two thumbs
and your baby inside of her?

13:48.446 --> 13:49.321
Nope.

13:49.322 --> 13:50.763
Hey, baby! No.

13:51.392 --> 13:53.282
If you want to split
Emma's tap shoes with me,

13:53.284 --> 13:55.051
you can just Venmo me
the cash, but again,

13:55.053 --> 13:56.835
the pregnancy was
the main point of the call.

13:58.493 --> 14:01.524
So remember that phrase,
just once for old times' sake?

14:01.526 --> 14:03.661
Ugh, what are you doing?

14:03.662 --> 14:05.417
Just call me, okay? We need to talk.

14:05.418 --> 14:08.490
I have to tell you that it is...

14:08.491 --> 14:10.680
Cinco de Mayo Eve. Arriba.

14:11.236 --> 14:13.880
Hey, Amy, which of these
looks most like a baby?

14:14.773 --> 14:17.187
Um, they're all bad.

14:23.348 --> 14:25.190
Or how about we talk about
your girl, Kelly, for a sec?

14:25.191 --> 14:27.633
With her fortune teller sleeves
and her Dallas eye shadow?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.452
Okay, I think we've gotten
a little off topic.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.407
Guys, Jonah's right. This is stupid.

14:31.544 --> 14:33.811
I'm not gonna go hiking, all right?

14:33.892 --> 14:35.374
I take the elevator to the second floor.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.243
Let me just... I'm gonna
put this stuff back.

14:37.245 --> 14:39.454
- No, wait, you don't have to.
- It's fine, okay?

14:39.455 --> 14:41.141
I'll take the first job
that comes along.

14:41.142 --> 14:42.765
I hear Spud City's hiring a peeler.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.327
- That seems about right.
- There you go.

14:44.328 --> 14:46.279
It's about time you
started facing reality.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.405
Jonah, stop, seriously.
Just look at him.

14:49.407 --> 14:52.208
Don't work at Spud City, or wherever.

14:52.210 --> 14:54.720
Just... We'll be all right.

14:57.515 --> 15:00.883
Yeah, Mateo's right. I crossed a line.

15:00.885 --> 15:04.086
You shouldn't take any job that
doesn't make you truly happy.

15:05.085 --> 15:06.518
How do you not get how this works?

15:06.520 --> 15:07.832
He was finally gonna get a job.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.452
I'm sorry, it's confusing.
You're a very good actor.

15:10.453 --> 15:11.852
I've also done plays.

15:14.695 --> 15:17.129
♪ This is the story of a girl ♪

15:17.131 --> 15:19.798
♪ Who cried a river and
drowned the whole world ♪

15:19.800 --> 15:22.634
♪ While she looks so sad in photo... ♪

15:26.614 --> 15:30.287
Oh, hey, Amy. I need your advice.

15:30.288 --> 15:31.747
Yeah, right now's not the best time...

15:31.748 --> 15:33.911
Yeah, I want to surprise Jerusha

15:33.912 --> 15:35.777
with some baby stuff at the party

15:35.876 --> 15:38.098
that can work for a boy or girl.

15:38.473 --> 15:40.125
Are bottles too wiener-shaped?

15:40.126 --> 15:42.237
I... yeah, I don't know, maybe, sure.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.172
Okay. God, there's so much stuff,

15:44.174 --> 15:45.281
it's overwhelming.

15:45.282 --> 15:47.225
Yeah, it's a lot.
It's very overwhelming.

15:47.227 --> 15:50.630
You got your wub-a-nub,
cribs, a infant carrier,

15:50.631 --> 15:52.589
wipe warmers... what is this kid,

15:52.590 --> 15:55.349
- the Queen of England?
- I can't be here right now.

15:55.466 --> 15:57.302
- Excuse me.
- Hey...

15:57.304 --> 15:58.870
Come on.

16:00.973 --> 16:03.341
- Hey, where you going?
- Look, Dina,

16:03.343 --> 16:04.843
I know I'm supposed to be working, okay?

16:04.845 --> 16:06.511
But I just... I can't be here right now.

16:06.513 --> 16:09.853
I need to go somewhere,
just anywhere away from here.

16:09.854 --> 16:12.083
And I can't get this
stupid [bleep] timecard

16:12.085 --> 16:14.212
to [bleep] work in the [bleep] thing!

16:14.213 --> 16:16.070
Hey, hey, hey. Let's get out of here.

16:16.071 --> 16:18.152
Okay, thank you.

16:21.562 --> 16:23.987
Sorry, I just feel weird
about not clocking out.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:33.738 --> 16:35.738
Of course, the eventual
plan would be to hike

16:35.740 --> 16:37.523
the Appalachian Trail, but for now,

16:37.525 --> 16:39.959
I'm just gonna walk
around the reservoir.

16:39.961 --> 16:41.076
Cool.

16:41.078 --> 16:43.429
- Bo and I did it there once.
- Oh.

16:43.431 --> 16:45.448
I've gone from expense
accounts and hotel dinners

16:45.450 --> 16:47.583
to having to figure out
what "squat and bury" means.

16:47.585 --> 16:50.536
I don't know, I think he's
kind of pulling off that hat.

16:50.538 --> 16:52.087
Are you kidding?

16:52.089 --> 16:54.757
He looks like if Freddie
Mercury was going fly fishing.

16:54.759 --> 16:56.851
Attention, ladies and germs.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.879
Sorry, I've always wanted to say that.

16:59.881 --> 17:01.920
Wait, where's Dina?

17:01.921 --> 17:04.497
Oh, no, she's not here.

17:04.498 --> 17:06.101
I guess we'll have to reschedule.

17:06.103 --> 17:08.887
- No, we can... we'll wait.
- Oh.

17:13.694 --> 17:15.060
So are we talking broken condom,

17:15.061 --> 17:17.060
or a pull and pray situation?

17:18.031 --> 17:19.903
- Can we not talk about that?
- Sure.

17:20.233 --> 17:21.498
Sure, sure.

17:22.114 --> 17:23.395
What do you think Alex is gonna say

17:23.396 --> 17:25.397
when he finds out you're
pregnant with Adam's baby?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.539
Let's not talk about that either.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.189
Okay, all right.

17:29.404 --> 17:30.617
Are you gonna get an abortion?

17:30.618 --> 17:32.520
How about we just listen to the radio?

17:32.521 --> 17:34.172
Oh, right, no radio.

17:34.660 --> 17:36.743
Look, we can ride in silence.
That is fine by me.

17:36.745 --> 17:39.966
I just needed to know if I
should head towards the clinic.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.937
The abortion clinic.

17:44.758 --> 17:45.806
For an abortion.

17:46.734 --> 17:47.250
No.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.080
Let's not head to the abortion clinic.

17:50.809 --> 17:51.997
You're sure?

17:53.387 --> 17:54.244
Yeah.

17:55.487 --> 17:57.795
Hey, Siri, cancel route.

17:58.465 --> 18:00.509
Okay, I've stopped navigating.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.679
Enough waiting!

18:12.037 --> 18:14.079
It's white. What does that mean?

18:14.080 --> 18:16.497
Maybe you guys are having a white baby.

18:16.498 --> 18:18.338
That's awesome. Congratulations!

18:18.979 --> 18:20.722
Garrett said that he was
gonna take care of

18:20.723 --> 18:23.274
the gender reveal, so we
just got a regular cake.

18:23.509 --> 18:24.788
I made the melon baby.

18:25.124 --> 18:26.975
Garrett, what is it?

18:27.596 --> 18:30.106
Uh, I don't know.

18:30.918 --> 18:31.498
What?

18:32.184 --> 18:34.227
I mean, I... I mean, I don't know.

18:34.937 --> 18:37.787
You don't know.
The doctor doesn't even know.

18:38.273 --> 18:41.107
I mean, what is gender, anyway, right?

18:41.109 --> 18:43.164
It's just a construct.
I mean, look around.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.434
We got a football, you got ballet.

18:45.435 --> 18:48.231
You guys are writing this baby's code

18:48.233 --> 18:49.632
before it even comes out!

18:49.633 --> 18:52.288
You're perpetuating gender stereotypes!

18:52.955 --> 18:55.765
How about we let this kid
figure out its own gender?

18:57.041 --> 18:59.434
You guys should be
ashamed of yourselves.

19:01.797 --> 19:04.497
It's just that things were
finally back on track.

19:04.499 --> 19:05.240
You know?

19:05.456 --> 19:07.562
Like, I was dating someone nice.

19:07.844 --> 19:09.719
Emma's almost out of the house,

19:09.721 --> 19:12.918
and I was gonna
get out there and have fun.

19:13.392 --> 19:15.422
You know, I was gonna
take skydiving lessons.

19:15.423 --> 19:17.607
Well, you have an excuse
not to do it now.

19:17.608 --> 19:19.674
What are you talking about?
I was gonna do it.

19:19.675 --> 19:22.130
- Mm-hmm.
- I visited the website like five times.

19:22.132 --> 19:24.025
Yeah, what's the name of the place?

19:24.752 --> 19:26.544
Captain Rick's...

19:27.191 --> 19:28.192
Skydiving...

19:28.956 --> 19:30.468
- Bonanza.
- Mm-hmm.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.882
Fine, the point is, I wanted the option

19:32.883 --> 19:35.115
to take the skydiving lessons, you know?

19:35.116 --> 19:36.822
I wanted to be able to be spontaneous

19:36.823 --> 19:39.014
and do what I wanted
to do for once, you know?

19:39.015 --> 19:42.133
All of the stuff that I'd...

19:42.361 --> 19:44.135
Who cares, doesn't matter anymore.

19:44.136 --> 19:45.390
Listen, if you ask me,

19:46.145 --> 19:48.875
you can always find a
reason not to do anything.

19:48.877 --> 19:51.000
And if there is stuff you want to do,

19:52.456 --> 19:53.509
do that stuff.

19:55.373 --> 19:56.223
Yeah.

19:57.433 --> 19:59.740
Maybe. I don't know.

20:00.313 --> 20:02.138
Have you ever played laser tag?

20:02.701 --> 20:05.132
Oh, it is awesome.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.394
They tell you not to
run, but you can run.

20:07.395 --> 20:08.345
You can.

20:19.539 --> 20:21.421
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:22.684 --> 20:23.954
What happened here?

20:23.955 --> 20:27.210
Oh, you know how crazy
gender reveal parties get.

20:27.211 --> 20:28.581
Yeah.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.217
There was so much Chianti,

20:30.218 --> 20:34.888
and the mozzarell' and
the unlimited bread-a sticks.
