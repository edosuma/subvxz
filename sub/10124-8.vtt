WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:12.400
HI. MY NAME'S CORY.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.967
THE SEVENTH GRADE DANCE
IS FRIDAY NIGHT, AND--

00:14.967 --> 00:18.000
I'M SORRY.
MY GRANDMOTHER'S SICK.

00:20.967 --> 00:22.300
ANY LUCK?

00:22.300 --> 00:26.400
APPARENTLY IT'S
NOT A GOOD TIME
TO BE A GRANDMOTHER.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.934
HER GRANDMOTHER'S
COUGHING PHLEGM,

00:28.934 --> 00:31.400
HER GRANDMOTHER'S
HACKING BLOOD,

00:31.400 --> 00:32.500
AND HER--

00:32.500 --> 00:34.000
WHOA.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.367
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
SHE HAS NO GRANDMOTHER.

00:36.367 --> 00:40.667
YES, AND SOMEHOW
SHE BLAMES ME
FOR HER DEATH.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.100
AT LEAST YOU CAN'T
SINK ANY LOWER.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.567
HEY, YOU.

00:44.567 --> 00:45.900
YOU BUSY?

00:45.900 --> 00:48.667
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO THE DANCE, ARE YOU?

00:48.667 --> 00:51.300
WHAT IF I DID?

00:51.300 --> 00:55.600
I'D SAY PICK ME UP
AT 8:00,
BUT NO SLOW DANCES.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.200
JUST WATCH THESE
FOR A SECOND.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.500
I CAN DO THAT.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.600
I'M NOT GOING
TO THIS DANCE
WITH ANYBODY.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.100
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ASK TOPANGA?

01:05.100 --> 01:08.600
I COULD,
BUT THAT'D SHOW
NO PERSONAL GROWTH

01:08.600 --> 01:11.767
IF I ASKED THE GIRL
I'VE ASKED
SINCE WE WERE 5.

01:11.767 --> 01:12.934
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO ASK HER?

01:12.934 --> 01:15.467
I FIGURE TOMORROW,
UNLESS SUDDENLY

01:15.467 --> 01:17.500
GIRLS START
TO NOTICE ME.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.567
HI. I COULDN'T
HELP NOTICING YOU.

01:21.567 --> 01:22.967
YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME?

01:22.967 --> 01:25.133
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
AT THE HOSPITAL

01:25.133 --> 01:27.734
VISITING ONE OF YOUR
BLOOD-HACKING GRANDMAS?

01:27.734 --> 01:30.200
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME
YOU PLAY?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.400
HUH?

01:31.400 --> 01:32.834
CORY, THEY'RE
ONTO US.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.400
THEY'VE SPOTTED
OUR AXES.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.967
THEY KNOW
WE PLAY.

01:35.967 --> 01:37.300
THEY LIKE MUSICIANS.

01:37.300 --> 01:40.667
OH, THEN WATCH ME PULL
THIS RABBIT OUT OF MY HAT.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.100
MUSICIANS!

01:43.934 --> 01:46.700
OH, WELL, THAT'S
VERY DIFFERENT.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.367
YOU GUYS
IN A BAND?

01:48.367 --> 01:50.300
ARE WE IN A BAND?

01:50.300 --> 01:51.867
ARE WE IN A BAND?

01:51.867 --> 01:54.767
YES, YOU IDIOT.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.500
WELL, MAYBE YOU'D
PLAY FOR US SOMETIME?

01:57.500 --> 01:59.800
WE'LL TELL
OUR FRIENDS
WE KNOW YOU.

02:03.100 --> 02:06.400
THEY LIKE US
BECAUSE THEY THINK
WE'RE IN A BAND.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.200
WE COULD CASH IN
ON THIS.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.200
BUT WE'D BE
TOTAL PHONIES.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.200
PHONIES WITH GROUPIES.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.800
NO. WE COULD NEVER
PULL THIS OFF

02:13.800 --> 02:16.867
IN A MILLION,
BILLION,
TRILLION YEARS.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.967
WOW! YOU GUYS
HAVE ROADIES?

02:18.967 --> 02:21.133
BOY, TIME FLIES.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.600
GOOD EVENING,
PHILADELPHIA!

02:26.600 --> 02:28.767
♪

02:28.767 --> 02:31.834
CORY--HEY,
MY OLD GUITAR.

02:31.834 --> 02:34.200
SHAWN AND I NEED IT
FOR OUR BAND.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.400
YOU'RE STARTING
A BAND?

02:35.400 --> 02:36.834
NOT REALLY.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.567
WELL, I USED
TO HAVE A BAND.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.133
YOU DID?

02:40.133 --> 02:43.100
YEAH. BACK THEN,
MUSIC WAS OUR
MEANS OF EXPRESSION.

02:43.100 --> 02:48.300
WE SANG ABOUT
FREEDOM OF SPEECH,
THE WAR IN VIETNAM.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.200
I'M IN IT
FOR THE CHICKS.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.600
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE
COMING FROM, KID.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.200
AMY, CORY AND SHAWN
ARE STARTING A BAND.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.800
TO MEET CHICKS?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.667
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

03:02.667 --> 03:04.600
THAT'S WHY YOU
STARTED YOUR BAND.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.567
NO, AMY. OUR BAND
WAS ABOUT THE MUSIC.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.734
WHAT DID YOU GUYS
CALL YOURSELVES AGAIN?

03:09.734 --> 03:11.900
THE TONGUES,

03:11.900 --> 03:14.600
AND IF MY MEMORY'S
CORRECT, YOU WERE
A BIG FAN.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.767
I WAS YOUNG.
I HAD NO TASTE.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.734
WOW. THIS BRINGS BACK
MEMORIES.

03:19.734 --> 03:23.834
ALAN, DON'T
GO THERE. IT WAS
A VERY LONG TIME AGO.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.033
AMY, THESE WERE
SOME OF MY
BEST FRIENDS.

03:26.033 --> 03:29.567
FRIENDSHIPS LIKE THAT
LAST A LIFETIME.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.667
I WONDER IF THEY'RE
STILL ALIVE.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.400
SO ARE YOU GUYS
GOING TO PLAY TODAY?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.300
TODAY? NO, WE NEVER
PLAY TODAY.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.400
WE'D LOVE
TO HEAR YOU PLAY.
PLEASE?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.600
O.K.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.467
EXCUSE US.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.500
SHAWN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN YOUR CASE,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.667
BUT I HAVE
AN EGG SALAD SANDWICH.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.400
CORY, THEY WANT
TO SEE US PLAY.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.667
LOOK AT THEM.
WHY CAN'T WE PLAY?

04:01.667 --> 04:03.500
BECAUSE WE DON'T
KNOW HOW.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.100
WELL, THAT WOULD
STOP US.

04:08.967 --> 04:11.600
SORRY, GIRLS.
WE'RE NOT PERFORMING
FOR THE PUBLIC.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.200
OUR MANAGERS
WON'T LET US.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.500
OH. WHY?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.300
BECAUSE WE'RE STILL
GETTING OVER
THE DEATH

04:17.300 --> 04:18.600
OF OUR DRUMMER.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.200
OH, WON'T YOU
PLEASE PLAY?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.000
O.K.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.200
CORY, EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.800
THEY ARE?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.500
THEY SAY
YOU'RE STARTING
A BAND.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.834
THEY'RE AWESOME.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.300
EXCEPT THEY DON'T
HAVE A DRUMMER.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.800
WHO ARE YOU?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.800
WE'RE WITH THE BAND.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.400
CORY, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE DANCE.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.967
JEREMY ASKED ME.

04:44.967 --> 04:46.700
I TOLD HIM
I WANTED TO SEE

04:46.700 --> 04:48.467
WHAT YOUR PLANS
WERE.

04:48.467 --> 04:51.133
IF YOU WANT
TO GO WITH JEREMY,
IT'S FINE.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.900
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M COVERED.

04:53.900 --> 04:57.200
O.K. MAYBE
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.300
CORY, WHEN DO WE
MEET THE REST
OF THE BAND GUYS?

05:02.300 --> 05:03.967
WHAT GUYS?

05:03.967 --> 05:07.467
THE GUYS. THE GUYS
I TOLD THEM ABOUT.

05:07.467 --> 05:10.200
I WANT TO MEET
THE GUY THAT PLAYS
GUITAR WITH HIS TEETH.

05:11.767 --> 05:14.367
OH. THE TEETH GUY.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.734
WELL, HE'S AT
THE DENTIST
RIGHT NOW.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.600
OHH.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.667
CORY, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D HEAR MYSELF SAY THIS,

05:21.667 --> 05:23.734
BUT WE'RE GOING
TO NEED SOME GUYS.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.467
♪ MY MAMA LEFT ME
BEFORE I WAS BORN ♪

05:46.800 --> 05:48.000
NO.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.800
I'D MAKE YOU LOOK BAD.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.233
YEAH.
NEXT!

05:51.233 --> 05:53.367

05:55.300 --> 05:57.700

06:02.100 --> 06:04.867
SO LET ME
UNDERSTAND THIS, THOR.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.800
WELL, YEAH.

06:09.667 --> 06:12.300

OUR CHICKS.

YOU'RE IN.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.900
NOW YOU GOT
TO HAVE A GUY
LIKE THAT.

06:28.900 --> 06:31.400
GUYS, IF THIS BAND
IS GONNA SUCCEED,

06:31.400 --> 06:33.000
WE GOT TO FOLLOW
ONE RULE.

NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

06:34.600 --> 06:38.133
NO MATTER HOW CUTE
THE GIRL IS,

06:38.133 --> 06:41.834
WE NEVER EVER
PLAY A NOTE,

06:41.834 --> 06:43.867
AND WHY IS THAT, SHAWN?

06:43.867 --> 06:46.767
'CAUSE WE DON'T
KNOW HOW.

06:46.767 --> 06:50.200
WHOA. HEY, NOW THIS
LOOKS LIKE A BAND.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING FOR.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.367
WOULD I LOOK COOLER
NOT PLAYING
THE GUITAR

06:55.367 --> 06:57.233
OR NOT PLAYING
THE DRUMS?

06:57.233 --> 06:58.033
HI, HONEY.

06:58.033 --> 07:00.066
SOME IDIOT
WAS SELLING THIS.

07:00.066 --> 07:02.100
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE HAD.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.567
I'LL BET
HIS WIFE DID.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.700
HONEY, IT'S JUST FUN.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.000
WHEN THE GUYS
COME OVER FRIDAY,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.200
WE PROBABLY WON'T
EVEN PLAY.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.600
THERE YOU GO, DAD.

07:13.033 --> 07:13.934
IT'S JUST FUN.

07:13.934 --> 07:18.100
THIS FUN JUST
KEEPS PILING UP.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.800
I PICKED UP
YOUR JACKET.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.734
COOL. MY BAND JACKET.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.300
YOU GUYS
ACTUALLY WORE THOSE?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.100
OH, YEAH.
THIS WAS OUR LOOK.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.867
DID PEOPLE LAUGH?

07:28.867 --> 07:31.567
NO. THEY
WERE IMPRESSED,
ESPECIALLY YOUR MOTHER.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.400
HER NAME'S SEWN
RIGHT IN THE SLEEVE.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.233
YEAH. WHAT'S WITH
THE OTHER NAMES--

07:36.233 --> 07:38.600
PAULA, BETHANY,
ASHLEY?

07:38.600 --> 07:41.100
THOSE ARE SMALL TOWNS
WE PLAYED IN
NORTHERN PENNSYLVANIA.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.100
YOU'RE LYING?

07:43.100 --> 07:44.367
YES, I AM.

07:49.467 --> 07:50.800
HI, CORY.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.000
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.800
I WAS JUST
STANDING HERE

07:53.800 --> 07:56.734
LISTENING TO
THE MUSIC
IN MY HEAD.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.600
WOW. IS IT LOUD?

08:00.300 --> 08:01.667
SOMETIMES IT DROWNS
OUT MY THOUGHTS,

08:01.667 --> 08:05.200
BUT THEN I SEE YOU,
AND I KNOW IT'S
OUR SONG.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.500
OOH, THAT WAS
A GOOD ONE.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.734
PRETTY SMOOTH, MATTHEWS.

08:12.734 --> 08:14.033
OH. HEY, MR. TURNER.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.000
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE THERE.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.500
MAYBE YOU BETTER
TURN DOWN THE MUSIC
IN YOUR HEAD.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.500
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MR. TURNER?
WE'RE A LOT ALIKE.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.600
ARE WE?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.300
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THIS MOTORCYCLE HELMET,

08:26.300 --> 08:27.700
PEOPLE THINK
YOU'RE COOL.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.400
CARRYING THIS,
PEOPLE THINK I'M
COOL, TOO.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.133
I GOT THIS
MOTORCYCLE HELMET

08:32.133 --> 08:35.967
SO IF I CRASH MY BIKE
MY HEAD DOESN'T GO SPLAT.

08:35.967 --> 08:37.867
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THAT GUITAR CASE?

08:37.867 --> 08:40.133
TO PROTECT MY SANDWICH.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.400
IT IS WITH DEEP,
DEEP REGRET

08:48.400 --> 08:50.100
I MUST INFORM YOU

08:50.100 --> 08:52.300
THAT THE DEMON SEEDS
HAVE PULLED OUT.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.500
OHH.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.100
NOW, NOW!
STEADY.

08:55.100 --> 08:58.300
YOU'LL STILL
BE ABLE TO SHAKE
YOUR LITTLE BOOTIES.

08:58.300 --> 09:02.300
I HAVE MANAGED TO SECURE
A MORE THAN ADEQUATE
REPLACEMENT.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.200
THE COOL, MELLOW,
CARIBBEAN SOUNDS

09:05.200 --> 09:07.600
OF JOJO MAN
AND BROTHER B.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.867
OHH.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.667
WE WANT LIVE MUSIC.

09:11.667 --> 09:15.133
RECORDED LIVE
AT THE FIESTA ROOM

09:15.133 --> 09:17.000
OF THE MONTEGO BAY
HILTON.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
JUST GET
ANOTHER BAND.

09:19.000 --> 09:19.834
YEAH.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.233
GET ANOTHER BAND.

09:21.233 --> 09:23.700
HARD AS IT IS
TO BELIEVE,

09:23.700 --> 09:26.667
MY ROCK 'N' ROLL
CONTACTS
ARE LIMITED.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.233
WELL, CORY AND SHAWN
HAVE A BAND.

09:29.233 --> 09:30.600
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD,

I'VE HEARD THEM.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.500
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.567
CORY AND SHAWN!

09:39.567 --> 09:41.867
CORY AND SHAWN!

09:41.867 --> 09:44.800
WELL, MR. MATTHEWS,
YOU SEEM TO HAVE
QUITE THE FOLLOWING.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.400
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR JOLLY GROUP
OF MUSICMAKERS?

09:49.400 --> 09:51.000
OUR NAME?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.233
UM, THEY CALL US...

09:57.600 --> 09:59.200
THE EXITS.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.734
WELL, KUDOS!

10:05.400 --> 10:08.233
YOU HAVE A GIG.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.033
HAVE YOUR PEOPLE
CALL ME.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.300
WE'LL GET
TO HEAR YOU PLAY

10:11.300 --> 10:12.834
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.367
SHAWN, LOOK WHO'S GOING
TO PLAY THE DANCE.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.500
THE EXITS.
THEY'RE GREAT.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.700
THEY'RE US.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.300
OOH, THEY'RE NOT
SO GOOD.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.300
HOW COULD YOU
BOOK OUR BAND?

10:30.300 --> 10:31.834
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

10:31.834 --> 10:35.834
SONIA WAS MAKING
PURRING NOISES
IN MY EAR.

10:35.834 --> 10:39.800
WHAT ABOUT OUR BAND
CREDO--WE NEVER EVER PLAY.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.934
WE HAVE TO PLAY.
FEENY BOOKED US,

10:41.934 --> 10:45.367
AND I MAY HAVE
POSSIBLY SIGNED
SOME PAPERS,

10:45.367 --> 10:48.400
BUT WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.700
SEE YA.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.467
O.K. O.K.,
NOW, DON'T PANIC.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.500
WE'LL JUST PLAY
THE OLD HITS,

10:56.500 --> 10:57.967
NONE OF THE NEW STUFF.

10:57.967 --> 11:01.033
MAYBE ONE ENCORE,
WE'RE IN THE LIMO,
AND WE'RE HOME.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.400
O.K., WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.500
WE HAVE TO GO ON.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.100
THE GIRLS LOVE US.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.200
YEAH. WE'VE WORKED
TOO HARD.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.367
WE HAVE TO COME UP
WITH A PLAN.

11:17.367 --> 11:22.233
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S SO CRAZY,
IT JUST MAY WORK.

11:22.233 --> 11:23.834
WHAT MAY WORK?

11:23.834 --> 11:25.233
THE PLAN.

11:25.233 --> 11:28.100
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT WAS.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.200
THAT WAY, THEY CAN'T
GET IT OUT OF ME.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.500
GET WHAT OUT OF YOU?

11:32.500 --> 11:36.100
NICE TRY.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.300
I BOUGHT TWO
CEMETERY PLOTS.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.100
I FIGURE I'LL
SUBDIVIDE LATER,

11:42.100 --> 11:43.767
LET THEM BURY ME
STANDING UP.

11:43.767 --> 11:45.900
WHAT THE HECK
DO I CARE?

11:45.900 --> 11:47.900
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE SOON.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.000
YOU KNOW WHY?
MY CHOLESTEROL IS 10.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
LISTEN TO YOU GUYS

CEMETERY PLOTS,

DANGEROUS.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.567
YOU WANT DANGEROUS?

12:01.567 --> 12:02.934
I CHEAT ON MY WIFE.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.133
WHAT?

12:04.133 --> 12:06.033
I GO
TO THE GROCERY STORE,

12:06.033 --> 12:07.233
PEEL OFF THE FAT-FREE
STICKER

12:07.233 --> 12:08.734
OFF THE ENTEMMANN'S
CAKE.

12:08.734 --> 12:12.233
I STICK IT
ON THE BOX OF DOUBLE
FUDGE DOUBLE BUTTER

12:12.233 --> 12:14.100
BROWNIE BALLS OF DEATH.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.734
I BRING IT HOME.
I SAY, "LOOK, HONEY,
FAT FREE."

12:18.734 --> 12:22.600
SHE'S EATING CELERY.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.500
GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

12:25.500 --> 12:28.367
REMEMBER THOSE
WILD TIMES
WE HAD TOGETHER?

12:28.367 --> 12:30.200
REMEMBER--REMEMBER
IN SCRANTON

12:30.200 --> 12:31.934
WITH THOSE TRIPLETS?

12:33.467 --> 12:35.767
SORRY.
NO.

12:35.767 --> 12:38.133
O.K., GUYS,
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DRINK?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.000
MY BOYS WILL HAVE
SOME BREWSKIS.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.934
ACTUALLY,
SOME MINERAL WATER.

12:41.934 --> 12:42.934
DIET ICED TEA.

12:42.934 --> 12:44.400
WOULD IT BE A HASSLE

12:44.400 --> 12:46.233
TO RUN CARROTS
THROUGH THE JUICER?

12:46.233 --> 12:49.900
I'LL HAVE A BEER.
THANKS.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.033

12:51.033 --> 12:53.233

13:08.200 --> 13:09.600
WELL, WE GOT

13:09.600 --> 13:10.834

13:10.834 --> 13:13.734
THAT'S OUR
BACKUP PLAN.

13:13.734 --> 13:17.300
MUST MAKE YOU PROUD
HAVING YOUR SON
FOLLOW YOUR FOOTSTEPS.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.400
YEAH. IT SURE DOES.

13:19.400 --> 13:24.467
WHOA, WHAT'S THIS?

13:24.467 --> 13:26.100
OOH, IS THAT
YOUR OLD STRAT?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.300
YOU BET IT IS.

13:27.300 --> 13:31.300
I TUNED IT UP. IT'S
LIKE I NEVER PUT IT DOWN.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.200
THIS IS A BEAUTY.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.033
I GUESS YOUR WIFE
THREW YOUR AX OUT.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.700
NO, IT'S IN
THE VAN.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.500

MINE'S IN THE TRUNK.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.000

13:43.400 --> 13:45.967
WE'LL JAM.
HEY! THE TONGUES.

13:45.967 --> 13:49.567
HOW ABOUT THAT,
AMY? WE'RE
GOING TO PLAY.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.934
THE BOYS ARE BACK.

13:51.934 --> 13:54.600
THIS BETTER NOT BE
TO MEET CHICKS.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.767
CHECK. MICROPHONE ONE.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.300

14:23.233 --> 14:24.900

IS PACKED.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.100
WE'RE DEAD.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.000
WOW. LOOK

PRETTY GIRLS.

WE CAN PLAY.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.600
SHAWN, WE CAN'T.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.033
THAT'S WHY I GOT
THOSE GUYS
WHO <i>CAN </i>PLAY

14:39.033 --> 14:40.400

GOING ON, MAN.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.400
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:07.400 --> 15:11.400
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT THE LACK
OF RESPECT

15:11.400 --> 15:12.767
FOR ARTISTS.

15:12.767 --> 15:15.500
YOU SEE THIS TURKEY?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.600
THIS TURKEY
IS PRESSED.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.000

15:19.000 --> 15:21.400

EATS HAND-CARVED TURKEY.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.400

18:10.600 --> 18:12.300
HEY, YOU MIGHT.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.800
WE COULD START PLAYING

YOU GUYS
SOUNDED GREAT.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.300
THEY SOUNDED GREAT.
I DIDN'T.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.000
I USED TO BE GOOD.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.300
ALAN, I SAY THIS
WITH LOVE AND RESPECT.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.000
YOU WERE NEVER GOOD.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.033
WHAT? YOU SAID
IT WAS MY MUSIC

18:39.033 --> 18:41.600
THAT ATTRACTED YOU
TO ME ORIGINALLY.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.400
AND YOU BELIEVED ME?

18:43.400 --> 18:46.033
WELL, YES. I BASED
MY LIFE ON IT.

18:46.033 --> 18:50.367
IT WAS NEVER THE MUSIC.
IT WAS THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

18:50.367 --> 18:51.734
WHAT PACKAGE?

18:51.734 --> 18:54.900
YOU. YOU WERE CUTE,
AND YOU LOOKED
ADORABLE

18:54.900 --> 18:56.600
WITH YOUR
LITTLE GUITAR.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.400
IT DIDN'T MATTER
THAT YOU COULDN'T
PLAY VERY WELL.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.500
I JUST LIKED YOU.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED ME

19:03.500 --> 19:08.600
BECAUSE OF MY MUSIC,
AND YOU JUST LIKED
ME BECAUSE OF ME.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.867
I FEEL SO CHEAP.

19:09.867 --> 19:13.300
YOU WANT TO FEEL
REALLY CHEAP?

19:17.500 --> 19:19.934
YOU KNOW, THERE
WAS ONE POINT

19:19.934 --> 19:22.967
WHERE I THOUGHT
WE REALLY HAD THEM.

19:22.967 --> 19:25.734
THEY WERE SCREAMING
EXITS! EXITS!

19:25.734 --> 19:30.967

FOR A WAY OUT.

YOU FEEL BEATEN
AND HUMILIATED,

19:41.967 --> 19:43.500
YOU'VE LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON

19:43.500 --> 19:47.734
THAT YOU SHOULD
NEVER TRY TO BE
SOMEONE BLAH, BLAH,

19:47.734 --> 19:49.100
