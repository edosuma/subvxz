WEBVTT

00:13.740 --> 00:15.105
Hey, Patel!

00:19.680 --> 00:21.318
Are you open or what?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.908
Can we get some
coffee over here?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.298
Oh, my God.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.608
MAN: _
The next planetarium tour
starts in five minutes.

00:44.070 --> 00:45.298
He doesn't
have the binder.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.507
He's never
gonna pass the test.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.878
Don't let him see it.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.777
CARRIE: Hey.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.216
What's going on?
You look...

00:54.280 --> 00:57.841
You look like you're having
a little trouble there, huh?

00:57.920 --> 01:00.059
I got ditched by my team.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.280
You did?

01:01.360 --> 01:03.521
We took... We took
all the notes together,

01:03.590 --> 01:05.683
but they have
the binder, so I...

01:05.760 --> 01:08.251
So you can't answer
the questions, huh?

01:08.330 --> 01:10.992
Luclq for you,
I remember everything.
What grade are you in?

01:11.070 --> 01:12.094
Sixth grade.

01:12.170 --> 01:13.762
I was in the sixth
grade once, too,

01:13.840 --> 01:15.296
and I had to take
a tour of the planetarium

01:15.370 --> 01:17.258
and answer_
a bunch of questions.

01:17.340 --> 01:18.932
Let me take
a look at this.

01:19.010 --> 01:22.036
We're gonna bring out
your inner genius right now.

01:22.110 --> 01:24.271
Okay, what is
the brightest star?

01:24.350 --> 01:27.877
Well, they're gonna
expect you to say Sirius
is the brightest star

01:27.950 --> 01:29.918
because it is the
brightest star that
you can see at night.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.787
But the real
brightest star,

01:31.850 --> 01:33.909
other than you
of course, is?

01:35.320 --> 01:36.355
The sun?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.250
Exactly, you're a genius.

01:38.330 --> 01:41.254
All right, what is the name
of the ninth planet?

01:41.330 --> 01:42.319
What is with these people?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.220
This is another
trick question.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.269
What they want you to
say is that there is
no ninth planet

01:47.340 --> 01:50.161
because Pluto is just
a big chunk of floating ice.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.128
But I think Pluto
might get a second chance.

01:53.310 --> 01:54.334
How do you
know all that?

01:54.410 --> 01:56.139
I remember everything.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.302
That's so cool.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.745
You're cool.

01:58.810 --> 02:01.210
Hey, if those kids
give you a hard time anymore,

02:01.280 --> 02:03.487
you tell 'em you have
a friend who's a cop

02:03.550 --> 02:05.040
and she'll arrest them.

02:06.790 --> 02:09.008
Hey, Al.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.201
All right, thanks.
Okay.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.305
CARRIE: Hey, Al,
what do we got?

02:23.370 --> 02:25.258
Victim's name
is Sunil Patel.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.672
Born in India,
worked here about two years.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.207
Friend of
the family owns the place.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.601
Register was untouched,
so not a robbery.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.715
CARRIE: Hmm.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.780
He comes in,
opens up the store, right?

02:36.850 --> 02:39.250
First thing he's
gonna do is

02:39.320 --> 02:40.651
make the coffee.

02:40.720 --> 02:41.755
But there are no filters.

02:44.030 --> 02:47.022
So, he goes to
get the filters

02:47.100 --> 02:48.624
and before he can
finish what he started

02:48.700 --> 02:51.464
he comes face to face
with his killer.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.539
What about the owner?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.760
Kamala Kapoor.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.000
Patel always came in first,

02:58.070 --> 02:59.708
then she'd come
and help him open up.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.532
Okay, what'd she
have to say for herself?

03:01.610 --> 03:03.578
Not much.
She's pretty shaken up.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.470
Really?

03:05.550 --> 03:08.348
She's also 5'2",
maybe 125 pounds.

03:08.420 --> 03:12.652
As I recall,
Emily Merris from Syracuse
was five-foot and 100 pounds,

03:12.720 --> 03:15.086
and she stabbed
her husband 17 times.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.948
As I recall, little
Emily stabbed her husband
while he was unconscious.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.157
And as I recall,
little Emily smacked him

03:21.230 --> 03:22.788
over the head with
a 40-pound mallet.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.225
Are you always right?
Mostly.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.790
All right, I'll
check her out again.

03:26.870 --> 03:27.962
Thank you.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.268
Hey.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.898
What've you got?

03:30.970 --> 03:32.631
So it appears
this young man
died of asphyxiation.

03:32.710 --> 03:35.736
There's minimal _
trauma to the nostrils,
no ligature marks.

03:35.810 --> 03:36.970
Honestly, I can't
be certain

03:37.050 --> 03:39.245
what the cause of death is
until I open him up.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.175
Well, whatever it was,
he put up a fight.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.200
Hey, Al, have you
had a chance to...
Sandra Russo.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.542
Been a long time.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.508
Hello, Al. I knew
you'd be lurking around

04:15.580 --> 04:16.911
here somewhere.
Good to see you.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.582
I thought lurking
was more your thing.

04:18.650 --> 04:20.015
Okay, so you two have met.

04:20.090 --> 04:21.751
Well, Al, Captain
Russo here...

04:21.820 --> 04:22.923
Captain?

04:22.990 --> 04:25.083
Oh, of course,
you've made captain.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.128
No, Al, Captain
Russo, she's...

04:27.200 --> 04:30.089
Actually, I'm here
looking for some help.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.262
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.866
What help could
you possibly need?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.396
Certainly not with
your career, right?

04:34.470 --> 04:36.131
Going so well.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.065
Maybe with a case?

04:38.140 --> 04:40.608
Did the commissioner
ask you to do some
real police work,

04:40.680 --> 04:42.136
you got all excited
and then you remembered,

04:42.210 --> 04:43.973
you don't know
what that is?

04:44.050 --> 04:46.712
Actually, the commissioner
did ask me to do a job.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.817
Very good.
And I do need your help.

04:49.890 --> 04:53.018
Well, we're kind of
busy here at Major Crimes,
Captain Russo.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.250
If the commissioner
wants our help,

04:54.320 --> 04:55.878
he can start by
giving us a new boss.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.949
Oh, he has.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.657
He has?

05:00.930 --> 05:02.568
You gotta be kidding me.

05:02.630 --> 05:08.193
_ No. I would have_
given you some warning,
but I just decided not to.

05:08.270 --> 05:10.761
You're the new head
of Major Crimes?

05:10.840 --> 05:13.638
Al, look, for the last
two years, Major Crimes

05:13.710 --> 05:15.507
has been the jewel
in this police force.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.447
Mostly due to you and
your brilliant partner.

05:18.510 --> 05:21.513
I'm just here to keep
that jewel sparkling.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.842
That's my job.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.481
Yours, like it always was,
is to take the credit.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.879
That's funny.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.520
I remember you didn't mind
taking credit eight years ago.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.718
Or do you still not
wanna talk about that?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.552
I'm not talking
about Tendler.

05:35.630 --> 05:38.360
Not now, not ever.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.933
Welcome to Major Crimes,
Captain Russo.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.664
Thank you.
This is gonna be great.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.834
So I haven't looked
at samples from Patel's
nasal cavity yet.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.468
Okay.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.279
But I did find
subdural hemorrhaging
around the nose and mouth.

05:52.350 --> 05:56.013
Probably caused by
pinching the nose shut
and holding the jaw closed.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.945
How does that...
How does that work?

05:58.020 --> 05:59.009
Come here.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.357
Okay.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.183
Okay, so you see this a lot
in human smuggling, right?

06:05.260 --> 06:07.353
You got a truckload of
cargo at a checkpoint,

06:07.430 --> 06:10.627
somebody's coughing, sick
or they just won't be quiet.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.635
Coyotes got a quick
way of shutting them up.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.072
What?

06:20.140 --> 06:21.505
I did a year with
ICE down in Yuma.

06:21.580 --> 06:23.901
Why would somebody
wanna shut this guy up?

06:23.980 --> 06:26.949
I don't know.
But when you find
out let me know.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.910
Hey, so the Patel kid
checks out.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.059
He's squealq clean.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.054
He's got a family
back in Mumbai, India.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.883
Landlord says
he's a great tenant.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.383
Apparently he sends
a quarter of his paycheck
home each week.

06:39.460 --> 06:40.996
Sure it's going
to his parents?

06:41.060 --> 06:42.789
Got nothing from
the FBI or Homeland.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.292
I mean, I'll
keep digging, Al,

06:44.370 --> 06:46.736
but I don't make this
kid for a terrorist.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.994
Let's be sure.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.937
All right.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.898
So, you and the captain?

06:51.970 --> 06:55.235
You, um... You go
back a little, yeah?

06:55.310 --> 06:56.572
A little.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.644
Well, hey,
old times, right?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.210
Very old times.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.279
Hey, so we got
a cause of death
on Sunil Patel.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.429
Interesting.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.923
Care to share
with the class?

07:11.990 --> 07:14.652
It's like a two-handed
suffocation thingy.

07:14.730 --> 07:15.856
Bare-handed, maybe.

07:15.930 --> 07:16.919
Ba re

07:17.000 --> 07:18.365
Yeah, you pinch
the nose shut,

07:18.430 --> 07:19.465
you hold the mouth
closed like...

07:20.870 --> 07:22.064
Well, turn around
I'll show you.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.903
Uh, no.
Okay.

07:23.970 --> 07:26.006
Jay, do a crosscheck
for that MO in
other homicides.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.731
You got it, Boss.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.129
Who's, uh...

07:29.210 --> 07:31.644
Who's the new suit?
Oh, that's your new boss.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.575
Captain Sandra Russo.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.072
She looks, uh...

07:35.150 --> 07:36.481
She looks pretty tough.
Any first impressions?

07:36.550 --> 07:37.710
Known her a while.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.519
She was my lieutenant
back at the 117.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.480
Only stuck around
for a cup of coffee.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.152
Long enough to
make captain anyway.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.955
Sounds like
there's a story there.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.248
Ah, nothing
worth telling.
All right.

07:49.330 --> 07:52.299
Well, perhaps I should
introduce myself.

07:52.370 --> 07:53.359
Ah.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.664
How's my hair?

07:55.740 --> 07:57.401
Yeah, your hair is good.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.165
Hey, Al. I might have
something for you on Patel.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.798
There was a similar
homicide last night

08:00.880 --> 08:02.370
at a private club
over on East 8lst Street.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.873
They found
the body this morning.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.542
Preliminary on-scene
coroner's report

08:05.610 --> 08:08.738
says suffocation,
most likely by hand.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.479
Well, cleaning crew
found him, apparently,
all right?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.085
Michael Liu,
some big international
finance hotshot.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.752
Look at this place.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.127
It's a sex club
with a bar.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.418
You a regular here?
Well, you know.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.489
I'm a friendly guy.

08:23.630 --> 08:26.190
Come on,
body's in the back.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.504
All right. Okay, look.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.606
We've got hemorrhaging
around the mouth.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.999
Same MO as Patel.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.548
Two in one day?
Someone's on a mission.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.409
You smell that?

08:45.490 --> 08:46.684
What?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.216
Cologne.

08:48.290 --> 08:50.429
DENNY: I'm more of a
body spray guy myself.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.378
I bet you are, Denny.

08:52.460 --> 08:53.688
Well, it is
very refreshing.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.193
Listen, I want you
to have Delina do

08:55.260 --> 08:58.024
a skin scrape of
his face and his neck.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.795
Your body scrape
request is my command.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.235
DREW: Step away
from the body.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.733
I'm sorry. Excuse me?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.459
RUSSO: Easy, easy, Drew.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.328
Detective Wells,
I'm Sandra Russo,
your new captain.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.241
I have heard so
much about you,

09:10.310 --> 09:12.744
and it is such a pleasure
for me to meet you.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.572
Well, it's an honor
to meet you, too.

09:14.650 --> 09:15.776
Thank you.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.511
This is Denny.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.444
Yeah, call me Denny.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.214
Okay.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.281
Call me whatever
you want. I mean,
you're the captain, so...

09:24.360 --> 09:25.429
Detective Padilla.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.391
So, I hate to start
off on the wrong foot,

09:28.460 --> 09:31.065
but this is Special
Agent Drew Miller,

09:32.270 --> 09:33.999
and the Bureau's
gonna run with this one.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.162
Why?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.128
Well, because,
as you're aware, Detective,

09:37.210 --> 09:39.508
when the FBI has
an ongomg case,

09:39.570 --> 09:43.609
the NYPD generally
defers to a Bureau
request for jurisdiction,

09:43.680 --> 09:45.443
and that's what's
happening right now.

09:45.510 --> 09:46.579
I'll be taking it
from here.

09:46.650 --> 09:48.072
Excuse me.

09:48.150 --> 09:51.085
What exactly is
the FBI investigating?

09:51.150 --> 09:52.686
Sorry, that's
conﬁdenﬁaL

09:54.160 --> 09:56.116
All right,
we're done here.

09:56.190 --> 09:57.680
I like how you
didn't take his shit.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.387
Yeah, well, I'm
just getting started.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.257
This is gonna be fun.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.532
Hey, Delina.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.704
Hey.

10:09.770 --> 10:12.068
So, what's going on?

10:12.140 --> 10:14.529
Suddenly I get
a directive to give
everything I got on Liu

10:14.610 --> 10:16.532
to the feds
and only the feds.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.408
Well, I would think of
it as less of a directive

10:19.480 --> 10:21.619
and more of a,
you know, suggestion.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.817
Is that right?

10:23.820 --> 10:25.048
Got it.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.008
All right, well,
I can pretty much confirm

10:27.090 --> 10:29.650
the cause of death
on Michael Liu is
the same as Patel.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.322
Manual suffocation.

10:31.390 --> 10:32.948
_ But here's
the interesting part.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.497
You smelt _
something on Liu, right?
Mmm-hmm.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.959
Like a cologne?
Yeah.

10:36.030 --> 10:38.419
Some kind of cologne
was on Sunil Patel, too.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.967
Really?
Around the
mouth and nose.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.292
It was faint, but it
was definitely there.

10:42.370 --> 10:43.837
Check that out.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.799
Lavender, tea tree,
ambergris.
Right.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.279
I mixed some up for you.

10:48.340 --> 10:51.173
Now, it might not be exact,
but you'll get the idea.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.772
Here.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.417
You smell that?
What?

10:59.490 --> 11:00.889
Cologne.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.552
That's it.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.157
Thank you, Delina.
No problem.

11:05.230 --> 11:08.529
Any time. All right,
I just sent you the report.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.727
You did?
Yep.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.396
Oh, boy.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.461
Shit's about
to hit the fan.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.006
RUSSO: What part of
"We're out of this case,"

11:18.070 --> 11:20.072
do you and your partner
not understand?

11:20.140 --> 11:24.600
We just got this
email to Major Crimes
directed to Detective Wells

11:24.680 --> 11:26.375
from _the medical
examiner's office

11:26.450 --> 11:28.077
regarding a certain
Michael Liu. What's that?

11:28.150 --> 11:30.311
We're not trying to
muscle in on the feds,

11:30.390 --> 11:32.085
but these
homicides are related.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.913
All right, I hear you,
but you know what?

11:33.990 --> 11:36.311
You two have
lived up to the hype.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.381
But listen to me,
I'm here to support you.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.588
The best way to support us
is to let us do our thing.

11:41.660 --> 11:42.888
Look, I'm gonna
tell you the department

11:42.970 --> 11:45.097
is very, very happy
with your solve rate,

11:45.170 --> 11:47.195
but your success
comes with a cost.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.090
There are cops
in every precinct

11:49.170 --> 11:52.333
asking why they
can't do things
the Carrie Wells way.

11:52.410 --> 11:53.968
I wish I could tell 'em.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.600
But that's not your job.
That's my job.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.806
Oh.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.575
And my answer is,
from now on,

11:59.650 --> 12:01.117
this department
is not gonna be run

12:01.180 --> 12:04.581
like some rogue
branch of the NYPD.

12:04.650 --> 12:07.483
We are going to
follow the standard rules

12:07.560 --> 12:09.380
and procedures of
this department.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.985
Rules and procedures?
Mmm-hmm.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.550
Gotta love that.

12:13.630 --> 12:15.291
What, you have
something to say?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.929
You know what?
I think you were
right the first time.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.798
Let's just not talk
about Tendler now.

12:21.870 --> 12:24.509
Oh, And please make sure
your partner understands
my concerns.

12:24.570 --> 12:25.935
Oh, I will.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.808
All right,
so have you got it?

12:31.880 --> 12:33.416
What's with
the cloak
What's up, Carrie?

12:33.480 --> 12:34.777
It's complicated.

12:34.850 --> 12:37.080
All right, so what
we're doing, is it illegal?

12:37.150 --> 12:38.947
Come on, Jay,
you know me.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.749
You're right.
It's illegal.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.527
Listen to me. There's
a_fine line between
iHegalandlegaL

12:43.590 --> 12:46.150
And I don't have time
for all the politics
on this one.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.095
_ There is a _
direct connection

12:48.160 --> 12:50.321
between Michael Liu
and Sunil Patel.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.130
The M0, the cologne.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.736
Everything
I get on Liu...

12:54.800 --> 12:56.267
Gets you one step closer
to finding Patel's killer.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.932
Exactly.
So, hand it over.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.604
Okay, very interesting guy,
this Mr. Liu.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.272
A couple years ago
a bunch of hackers

13:02.340 --> 13:05.241
tried to shut down
the New York Stock Exchange.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.040
Michael Li_u was
a person of interest.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.009
But the feds couldn't
find anything concrete
to tie him to the operation.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.548
You see, the Exchange
is one of the most
secure sites in the world.

13:14.620 --> 13:15.848
You need a direct line in.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.024
And without any proof of that,
the case fell apart.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.149
All right, and what has
Mr. Liu been up to since then?

13:22.060 --> 13:25.427
Well, Mr. Liu was pitching
some huge hush-hush
deal all over town.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.092
Met with big-money people.

13:27.170 --> 13:29.559
The feds have been
keeping a pretty close
eye on him though.

13:34.940 --> 13:35.929
I've seen him before.

13:36.010 --> 13:38.001
What's his name?

13:38.080 --> 13:41.117
That would be Philippe Huet.
Big securities trader.

13:41.180 --> 13:44.741
He was at
Patel's crime scene,
right near the deli.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.378
Well, that makes sense

13:46.450 --> 13:48.111
'cause Philippe Huet just
started a trading company

13:48.190 --> 13:49.885
that he runs
out of his townhouse,

13:49.960 --> 13:53.851
which coincidentally
is right next door
to the Deli News Deli.

13:53.930 --> 13:58.697
So maybe Philippe Huet
is our connection
between the two victims.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.858
You got it, Boss.
Good job.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.363
AL: Substances found on
Patel's face and neck

14:04.440 --> 14:06.931
definitively match
those found on Michael Liu.

14:07.010 --> 14:09.638
The two men were
killed by the same person.

14:09.710 --> 14:10.870
That's interesting.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.838
Even more interesting,
Philippe Huet,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.717
who met with Michael Liu
yesterday morning,

14:14.780 --> 14:16.645
lives right next door
to the Patel murder scene.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.119
Honestly, Russo,
I can't believe

14:19.190 --> 14:20.487
we're still
talking about this.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.255
Well, Detective
Burns and Wells

14:22.320 --> 14:23.958
may have linked
Philippe Huet to
both murders.

14:25.790 --> 14:28.350
Look, I don't want to
have to call the deputy
director on this.

14:28.430 --> 14:29.920
Oh, you don't have to.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.490
MELTZER: I'm right here, Drew.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.731
Deputy Meltzer, sir.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.291
Uh, we've already
taken a lead on this.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.701
Not anymore.

14:37.770 --> 14:40.079
Captain Russo's team has
developed some solid leads,

14:40.140 --> 14:43.075
_ and I want all _
operational command on this
to come from Major Crimes.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.071
Are you sure, sir?
I am.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.777
Get them up to speed,

14:47.850 --> 14:50.045
and the Bureau will
prowde tactical support
as needed.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.109
Nice work, Captain.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.612
Thank you.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.988
Well, looks like
we're partnering up

14:55.060 --> 14:57.028
on this one, Agent Miller.

14:57.090 --> 14:58.125
Okay.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.793
For the past two weeks,
we've been hearing chatter

15:02.860 --> 15:05.693
about an imminent
electronic attack
on the NYSE.

15:05.770 --> 15:08.398
We know Hue_t's
been constructing
a supercomputer cluster

15:08.470 --> 15:11.007
with various financial
hypercube architectures

15:11.070 --> 15:12.662
in the basement
of his townhouse.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.378
There's nothing really
illegal about building

15:14.440 --> 15:16.476
a fast computer
to make more money.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.906
Well, let's just say
Huet's motives are
somewhat suspect.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.710
Both his parents
worked for the UN
in Yemen.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.544
They were accidentally killed
in an American drone strike.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.508
Well, then, why
kill Michael Liu?

15:26.590 --> 15:28.319
We think Huet was
working with Liu

15:28.390 --> 15:31.257
on another attack
on the Exchange.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.992
But Liu had a weakness
for the boy bars,

15:34.060 --> 15:36.449
and he liked to drink
and he liked to talk.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.066
Lethal combination.

15:38.130 --> 15:40.132
But if you're so
concerned about Huet,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.599
why not just take
a look at his computers?

15:41.670 --> 15:44.161
Well, at this point, concern
is just about all we got.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.730
Not enough for a warrant.

15:45.810 --> 15:47.698
Of course, if he
were to voluntarily

15:49.740 --> 15:51.674
you may not
need a warrant.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.877
With all the SEC scrutiny
he's been under,

15:53.950 --> 15:55.474
he's not letting
anybody close.

15:55.550 --> 15:58.189
Unless he wants her close.

15:59.550 --> 16:01.859
Who we talking about here?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.182
You really think
she can get in?

16:03.260 --> 16:05.626
Oh, she can get in.

16:10.830 --> 16:14.539
ADAM: The 2011 Montrachets
are drinking beautifully now.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.261
Adam, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.500
I just wanted
to thank you

16:19.570 --> 16:21.470
for the recommendation
of the '05 Lynch-Bages.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.837
It was wonderful,
and I...

16:22.910 --> 16:24.275
You're welcome.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.369
Oh, wow.

16:27.450 --> 16:28.678
Oh, wow!

16:28.750 --> 16:30.809
I'm so sorry.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.983
I'm Talia. You're
Philippe Huet, right?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.057
You know me?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.610
Well, I don't
know you know you,

16:36.690 --> 16:39.079
but I know you
because of your

16:39.160 --> 16:41.822
Forbes cover article
a couple months back.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.165
Wow. That article was
something spectacular.

16:45.230 --> 16:46.265
I mean, what you said

16:46.330 --> 16:47.797
about emerging growth markets

16:47.870 --> 16:50.031
and how they're like wolves
protecting their young.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.998
You know, I use that
with my own staff.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.776
"Nurture and protection."

16:53.840 --> 16:55.398
It was the
perfect metaphor.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.274
I'm just babbling on here
like a crazy person.

16:59.350 --> 17:00.840
So sorry.
The point is that I...

17:00.920 --> 17:02.672
What is the point?

17:02.750 --> 17:07.187
Well, you just look so
much better in person
than you did on your cover.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.082
Join me for a drink.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.022
Okay.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.497
Are you in
finance yourself?

17:21.570 --> 17:23.561
No, I just have
a little design firm

17:23.640 --> 17:25.801
that you've probably
never heard of.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.872
Philippe, we have
work to do.

17:27.940 --> 17:31.398
Once my sister makes a plan
like a business lunch,

17:31.480 --> 17:33.812
she just sticks to it,

17:33.880 --> 17:34.972
and any interruption...

17:35.050 --> 17:36.039
I'm going to let them know

17:36.120 --> 17:37.849
that you are
running late, hmm?

17:40.090 --> 17:41.114
Oh.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.885
I don't think
she likes me.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.359
I feel like Ijust
busted in here

17:44.430 --> 17:45.954
and intruded on the whole...

17:46.030 --> 17:47.429
Please. This is why
I love New York.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.525
You never know
what's going to happen.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.119
Meaning?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.498
This morning
I never knew I'd be

17:54.570 --> 17:58.267
having a drink with
such a beautiful woman.

17:58.340 --> 18:00.274
You say that
to all the girls.
You're a flirt.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.671
Well, I'm French.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.846
You
don't sound French.

18:04.910 --> 18:08.209
My mother is,
but I went to school here.
And you know what they say.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.975
Frenchmen make the best

18:11.950 --> 18:13.588
croissant.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.059
Oh.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.851
That was a really bad joke.
That was terrible.

18:19.530 --> 18:20.690
Ah.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.467
Paris is my favorite city
in the whole world, though.

18:23.530 --> 18:24.997
And what're your
favorite spots?

18:25.070 --> 18:26.924
Well, Musee Rodin

18:27.000 --> 18:30.299
and that little carousel
at the base of
the Eiffel Tower.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.405
I think it's very charming.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.506
Touristy, but charming.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.808
Do you have
a favorite restaurant?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.276
La Fontaine de Mars.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.241
You know Paris
very well.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.776
I love Paris.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.386
Oh.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.589
I really should go.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.413
My sister is
going to be furious,

18:48.490 --> 18:51.254
but I want to meet
With you afterwards.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.254
I'd love to.
I should be done
in an hour.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.649
Where should we meet?

18:55.730 --> 18:56.992
Do you know Sag Harbor?

18:57.060 --> 18:58.869
Of course I know Sag Harbor,

18:58.930 --> 19:00.795
but I can't get
there in an hour
at this time of day.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.259
Actually, I can.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.448
Chopper on the roof.
You got to be kidding me.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.240
Hey, LaGuardia's backtracking
all the outgoing flight data.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.878
We should know any minute.

19:14.950 --> 19:15.939
She'll be okay.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.739
Of course she will.
Mmm-hmm.

19:18.820 --> 19:21.209
Yeah, she's a force
of nature, isn't she?

19:21.290 --> 19:24.953
Yeah. Sometimes I feel
like a storm chaser.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.658
Hey, LaGuardia
tracked them

19:28.730 --> 19:30.721
to the east end of
Long Island, South Fork.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.633
Philippe has a place
out there apparently.

19:38.910 --> 19:43.847
That helicopter
ride was something,
but this is... Wow.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.502
It's the weekend home.
It's huge.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.047
You're really rich,
aren't you?

19:47.110 --> 19:48.816
I'm a little.
Just a teeny...
You're a little bit rich?

19:48.880 --> 19:49.972
SARU: I'm sorry
to interrupt,

19:50.050 --> 19:51.688
but you're needed
in the study, sir.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.286
But we just got here.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.089
Manette says
it's important.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.220
Oh, Manette again.

19:58.290 --> 19:59.780
I'll try to get this over
as quickly as possible.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.157
All right.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.390
I can take care
of myself.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.098
You know, I'm used to
being on my own.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.407
You a regular here?
Well, you know.

20:12.470 --> 20:13.903
I'm a friendly guy.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.609
Hi-Meteor Cola.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.887
I thought you could
only get that stuff
in Shanghai.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.383
I used to love it.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.782
A few places sell
them now, I think,

20:28.860 --> 20:30.521
but they're not
easy to come by.

20:30.590 --> 20:33.184
Deshu's very particular
about his stash.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.251
Touch them at your peril.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.999
MAN: Here you are, sir.

20:40.070 --> 20:41.094
CARRIE: Thank you.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.764
So do you have
family in France or no?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.728
No. Um...

20:45.810 --> 20:49.598
My parents were
killed in an accident
several years ago.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.740
They were working
in a very dangerous
part of the world.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.311
They knew the risks.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.711
Still it's...

20:55.780 --> 20:57.645
It's hard.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.017
Sorry to hear that.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.978
So then it's just
you and your sister?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.187
Yeah, we're
all that's left.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.625
Would you ever
move back to Paris?

21:04.690 --> 21:06.226
No, my work is here now.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.894
But I thought
you quit the bank.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.622
I did. Now I'm
my own boss.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.928
I'm setting up
a trading firm

21:12.000 --> 21:14.798
with a direct link to
the Stock Exchange.

21:14.870 --> 21:17.634
That is if your government
will allow me.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.302
Will allow you?

21:19.370 --> 21:21.031
Your Securities _
Exchange Commissmn

21:21.110 --> 21:23.135
treats me_like
I'm a criminal.

21:23.210 --> 21:25.872
It's like I'm under
constant surveillance.

21:25.950 --> 21:30.068
You're very interesting,
you know. Mysterious.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.286
Well, mystery has a price.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.079
Sometimes I feel like
I can't trust anyone.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.120
You can trust me.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.995
MANE'I'I'E: Sorry to
interrupt, Philippe.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.298
Jakarta.

21:48.370 --> 21:49.997
Now?

21:50.070 --> 21:51.606
We weren't expecting to
hear from them till tomorrow.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.601
Early risers.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.368
Tell them I'll
be right there.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.216
Why do I get the feeling

22:03.280 --> 22:05.384
that your sister's
never going to let us
have a moment alone?

22:05.450 --> 22:08.453
Listen, let me just
handle this call,
and then I swear

22:08.520 --> 22:10.215
no more interruptions.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.318
Stay the night.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.121
I want you to stay with me.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.088
I would like that very much.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.297
Let me go deal
with Jakarta.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.714
You know, this guy Huet
sounds like he has
some anger issues.

22:36.450 --> 22:38.008
Assaulted an English banker

22:38.090 --> 22:39.819
when some minor
deal fell through.

22:39.890 --> 22:41.881
Suspect in two
other assaults

22:41.960 --> 22:44.724
in an airport
in the Maldives.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.258
Also charged with
drunk and disorderly.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.065
Jay, watch the car.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.098
You watch your back, Boss.

22:57.870 --> 22:59.030
I hope you like the room.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.829
Yeah, it's gorgeous.
I mean, I may never leave.

23:01.910 --> 23:04.071
If you need anything,
dial seven on the house phone.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.174
Good night.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.259
VVhat
are you doing?

23:23.330 --> 23:26.163
What are you still doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.063
It is not the
middle of the night.
It's 10:00 at night.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.368
Besides, I like it here.
I feel rich.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.737
Well, you're not.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.471
I'm getting you
out of here before
you get yourself killed.

23:33.540 --> 23:34.529
I'm not gonna
get myself killed.

23:34.610 --> 23:35.872
You're gonna get me killed.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.902
He trusts me. It's fine.

23:38.980 --> 23:42.177
Okay, he trusts you.
Trust this.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.411
Talia Oberfeld
would never carry a gun.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.946
Who are you

23:46.020 --> 23:47.009
Take the gun.
PHILIPPE: Talia.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.079
Talia!

23:49.820 --> 23:51.629
Are you decent?

23:51.690 --> 23:53.999
Neven

23:54.060 --> 23:58.019
Sorry. That phone
call was a disaster.
It went on way too long.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.897
Oh.
Nightcap?

23:59.970 --> 24:02.268
It's the middle
of the night,

24:02.340 --> 24:03.739
and I have had
such an exciting day

24:03.810 --> 24:05.505
with the helicopter
ride and everything.

24:05.570 --> 24:09.677
Do you mind ifI pick up
where we left off tomorrow?

24:09.740 --> 24:10.946
Tomorrow.

24:11.010 --> 24:12.079
Be my date.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.617
I'm hosting
a party at Solstice.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.046
Yes. Yes, and I'll
make you a deal.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.509
Since you're letting me get
my beauty rest tonight,

24:18.590 --> 24:19.943
tomorrow...

24:26.160 --> 24:27.650
I'll do whatever you want.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.595
Night.

24:37.540 --> 24:41.101
So, he's throwing a party
at Solstice tomorrow.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.807
Which is great.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.440
I'll get another
chance to dress up
and role-play and...

24:45.510 --> 24:47.444
I wish he was having it
at his townhouse, though.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.841
That way I could get
a look and see if his
servers are there.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.185
Well, I'll tell
Miller and Captain Russo
that we will be there.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.410
We?

24:54.490 --> 24:56.185
After what I just saw,
you're not going alone.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.023
Get out of here.
AL: Yeah.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.159
That's absurd.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.832
Well, that's unacceptable.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.070
What's wrong now?

25:14.140 --> 25:16.802
Solstice just got shut down
by the health department.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.074
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.004
Uh...

25:20.080 --> 25:21.513
Wow. So your party is...

25:21.580 --> 25:23.070
Yeah, not happening.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.549
Okay, well, I have an idea.
Uh-huh.

25:24.620 --> 25:25.939
I know it's gonna
sound crazy, but you said

25:26.020 --> 25:27.419
you had a house
in the city, right?

25:27.490 --> 25:28.616
Yeah.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.180
Big, fancy like this one?
Yeah.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.353
Why don't you just
move the party there?

25:32.430 --> 25:35.797
You can send out an email.
People would be there in,
like, a jiffy.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.090
Do you think?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.058
We have a date tonight, right?

25:41.170 --> 25:43.297
We have a date.
Okay.

25:47.340 --> 25:49.399
Hey, gotta say that was
a pretty slick move,

25:49.480 --> 25:50.469
shutting down the restaurant.

25:50.540 --> 25:51.939
How'd you pull that off?

25:52.010 --> 25:54.808
You know, the old
cockroach in a jar trick.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.108
That works, right?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.477
I did that once
at a Sizzlers,

25:57.550 --> 25:59.188
and they comped my
whole surf and turf.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.547
RUSSO: Jay.

26:00.620 --> 26:02.451
Jay, I'm joking.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.420
Yeah, no, I know.
I was joking, too. I mean...

26:04.490 --> 26:07.152
RUSSO: The deputy
health commissioner
owed me a favor,

26:07.230 --> 26:09.790
s_o Solstice will
get its A rating back
in a couple of days.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.067
So you got
Carrie's camera rigged
in that ring?

26:12.130 --> 26:14.633
Done and done_. _
Carrie's got a mini
receiver transponder.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.964
We can hear everything
and she can hear us.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.735
Does she know
what she's after
in the basement?

26:18.810 --> 26:20.061
Because she doesn't
have much time.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.801
Well, if Huet's
system is operational,

26:21.880 --> 26:24.178
it's gonna be lit up
like a Christmas tree.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.241
I still don't like
the idea of her being alone.

26:26.310 --> 26:28.517
Neither do I. That's why
I plan on being there.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.468
You, Boss

26:30.550 --> 26:35.419
Ted Sprague.
Talia's trusted
busmess assoaate.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.925
Yeah, I think throwing
a new face at Philippe

26:38.990 --> 26:40.890
is gonna raise
some red flags.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.020
Not to mention, he's pretty
serious about Carrie.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.159
I don't think he's gonna like
seeing her with another guy.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.960
Well, it's this or
she's in there alone.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.306
All right, you know what?
Be careful.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.073
Both of you.

26:59.250 --> 27:03.243
* Yeah, something in the air
and I feel it

27:07.490 --> 27:08.684
* Yeah

27:08.760 --> 27:11.752
* All I want _to do
is believe it *

27:14.430 --> 27:16.819
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.089
Oh, yes, I'd say
that's a 2004.

27:21.170 --> 27:22.364
Great vintage,
don't you think?

27:22.440 --> 27:24.465
Who are you?

27:24.540 --> 27:26.303
These champagne bubbles
are killing your brain cells.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.179
You said you wanted
a classy date, here I am.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.332
Not a classy date.

27:29.410 --> 27:31.401
You're my business
associate, Ted Sprague.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.209
Business associate.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.510
All right. Okay, look.

27:41.590 --> 27:44.058
We've got hemorrhaging
around the mouth.
Same MO as Patel.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.326
Yeah.

27:47.390 --> 27:50.359
Hey, Al, that guy
over there,

27:50.430 --> 27:52.421
he has a scar
on his finger.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.264
Michael Liu had
the exact same scar.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.934
CARRIE: Are you
getting this, Jay?

27:58.010 --> 27:59.261
JAY: I got something on it.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.534
Those scars are a brand

28:00.610 --> 28:02.373
from the Nine Monkeys
criminal organization.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.704
Talia, I've been
looking forward to
seeing you all day.

28:04.780 --> 28:09.410
Oh, hi. This is my
business associate,
Ted Sprague.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.640
Pleasure to meet you, Ted.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.381
Yeah, some set-up
you have here, Philip.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.387
Philippe.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.449
Ah.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.978
Well, I'll go mingle.
CARRIE: Mmm-hmm.

28:19.060 --> 28:22.097
I must say
I wasn't expecting you
to bring another man.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.422
Do I have _some
competition?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.593
With me there's
always competition.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.991
Well, it's a good thing
I like a challenge.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.799
Come on. Let me
show you the house.

28:29.870 --> 28:30.962
Okay.

28:47.690 --> 28:49.578
JAY: Okay, here we go.

28:49.660 --> 28:51.457
Say hello to

28:51.530 --> 28:53.020
Zhang Leji,

28:53.090 --> 28:57.356
Ram Kazi and
Mr. Lin Chunhua.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.193
Can we have profiles,
please, Agent Miller?

28:59.270 --> 29:01.033
The first two,
Leji and Kazi,

29:01.100 --> 29:03.660
have connections
with the Nine Monkeys.

29:03.740 --> 29:07.460
No national affiliation,
but branches all over
the world.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.044
The hack we were
investigating Liu for
was organized by them.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.407
And what about
the other guy?

29:12.480 --> 29:14.141
Lin Chunhua,

29:14.220 --> 29:17.610
goes by the name
Deshu in the States.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.238
The guy's
a stone-cold killer.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.480
These guys are serious.

29:25.830 --> 29:28.355
This one's my
most recent purchase.

29:29.330 --> 29:30.752
But this one...

29:30.830 --> 29:32.718
This one's been in the family
for three generations.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.869
CARRIE: Wow.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.663
It's beautiful.

29:36.740 --> 29:39.459
Your idea to have the party
here was a stroke of genius.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.637
The one downside being,

29:42.710 --> 29:44.644
I'm rather quickly going
through the champagne
in my cellar.

29:44.710 --> 29:46.007
Mmm.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.674
Speaking of champagne,
is that the powder room
right there?

29:48.750 --> 29:49.910
No, no, no.
That's the cellar.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.119
The powder room
is upstairs.
Okay.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.646
All right, I'll be
right back.
Okay.

30:00.830 --> 30:01.990
Hello?

30:10.370 --> 30:12.008
Jay, can I get a com check?

30:12.070 --> 30:14.209
Got you loud
and clear, Carrie.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.101
Hey, Carrie, that
painting back there?

30:17.180 --> 30:18.738
Is that what I think it is?

30:18.810 --> 30:20.346
Yep. Easy, Jay.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.014
Wow. This guy's got
some really good taste.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.446
Yeah, well, we
both know that.
He likes me.

30:27.150 --> 30:28.515
There's absolutely
nothing upstairs.

30:28.590 --> 30:31.650
I'm gonna head downstairs.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.891
Copy that. Got ya, Carrie.

30:39.870 --> 30:40.894
No.

30:41.770 --> 30:43.169
The cologne.

30:45.670 --> 30:48.230
Excuse me. What're
you d0ing here?

30:48.310 --> 30:49.834
I'm looking for
the powder room.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.199
This is the guest bedroom.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.373
The powder room
is at the other
end of the hall.

30:54.450 --> 30:55.439
Ah.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.247
Thank you.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.822
I was just
making progress there.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.562
I just found the same cologne
upstairs in the guest bedroom

31:15.640 --> 31:17.733
that I smelt on
both dead bodies.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.734
Does Deshu
wear that cologne?

31:19.810 --> 31:22.938
Well, I mean,
I don't think he
had it on tonight.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.648
Listen, I checked
out upstairs.

31:24.710 --> 31:26.143
I'm going down
to the basement.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.614
Wish me luck.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.375
Wish me luck.
Well, good luck.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.213
I'll bring you back
a bottle of champagne.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.706
Oh, boy.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.442
All right, Jay, help me
out here. Can you see this?

31:58.510 --> 32:00.501
JAY: Looks like
a Surveil Tech M130 keypad.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.969
I'm gonna try to run
a modified decryption
program.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.189
Carrie, can you put the camera
right up to each button?

32:05.250 --> 32:07.616
I'm gonna see ifI can
determine a wear pattern.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.510
All right.

32:09.590 --> 32:11.057
JAY: All right, it's gonna
take a couple seconds.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.950
WOMAN: It was definitely
a rose varietal.

32:13.030 --> 32:14.520
Fantastic. I forget
what it's called.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.659
What... Do you
remember what...

32:16.730 --> 32:19.062
WOMAN: You know what?
I'm not sure, but it's
based on the Grenache...

32:19.130 --> 32:21.496
I'm gonna have
to guess it's...

32:24.310 --> 32:25.459
MAN: Absolutely.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.565
We're all out.
Sorry about that.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.232
WOMAN: They're
definitely...

32:40.250 --> 32:41.751
I feel the same way about...

32:41.820 --> 32:43.310
Oh, there's our
host right now.

32:43.390 --> 32:44.721
_Excuse me for
just one second.

32:44.790 --> 32:47.088
Boy, what a party
you have thrown.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.128
Thank you, Ted.
Can you excuse me?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.895
Actually, um, before you go,

32:50.960 --> 32:54.236
there's just something
I need to discuss with you.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.939
I need to divest
$3 million or $4 million

32:57.000 --> 32:58.137
before the end of the year.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.098
I'm looking to place funds.

33:00.170 --> 33:02.001
I don't know what
Talia told you about me,

33:02.080 --> 33:03.832
but I'm really not
the person to talk to.

33:03.910 --> 33:06.049
I think you'd probably be
exactly the person to talk to.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.874
All right, Jay, come on.

33:09.950 --> 33:12.441
All right, maybe
a couple more seconds.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.556
It's still best to
consult a profe55ional.

33:14.620 --> 33:18.226
Yeah, well, I thought
that's what I was doing.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.461
We're out of champagne.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.188
Um, the thing is,
it's a lot of money.

33:28.270 --> 33:30.830
I don't want it go somewhere
that means nothing to me.
Mmm-hmm.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.606
Right.
I want it to
mean something.

33:36.310 --> 33:39.939
Oh, come on, Jay.
I'm running out of time here.

33:40.010 --> 33:41.841
Uh...

33:41.920 --> 33:43.217
Jay, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.446
JAY: N0.

33:47.420 --> 33:50.184
Hey, try 7-5-3-6-2.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.353
omm7saca.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.349
No.

33:54.430 --> 33:55.419
Uh...

33:58.270 --> 34:00.420
Carrie, try 2-4-2-5-6.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.468
2-4-2-5-6.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.932
Shit.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.744
Any time now
would be great, Jay.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.540
Carrie, try 2-3-6-4—7.

34:14.620 --> 34:15.712
This is gonna work.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.611
Come on, come on, come on.
All right.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.793
Wow.

34:35.270 --> 34:37.363
Can you get us behind
the server bank?

34:37.440 --> 34:38.429
Uh-huh.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.664
CARRIE: Let's see, he comes in
and he opens up the shop
this morning, right?

35:04.730 --> 35:07.369
First thing he does is
go to make the coffee.

35:07.430 --> 35:10.137
There's no filters, so he

35:11.940 --> 35:13.965
climbs up here to
get the filters.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.914
Jay, this orange cable.

35:21.980 --> 35:23.572
I saw the exact
same one in the deli.

35:23.650 --> 35:25.515
Carrie, can you go in
tighter on those?

35:28.520 --> 35:30.784
No way. I don't
believe it.
What?

35:30.860 --> 35:33.420
Those are multicore
fiber optic cables.

35:33.490 --> 35:35.026
They were invented
by the Dutch.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.499
I mean, I've heard of them.
I've never seen 'em.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.824
Jay, stay focused
with me. Okay?

35:38.900 --> 35:41.061
Basically, they're
the fastest data cables
in the world.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.690
I'm talking 250
terabytes per second
on a slow day.

35:43.770 --> 35:45.306
Okay, and what would
they need it for?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.736
You could download
the entire Harry Potter
movie series

35:47.810 --> 35:49.368
in about
0.06 milliseconds,

35:49.440 --> 35:52.204
but my guess is Huet's got
something else in mind.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.748
Carrie, can you
follow those cables
to their source?

35:59.050 --> 36:00.779
Wait a minute, hold on.

36:00.850 --> 36:03.819
They're jacked
into the system
as output cables.

36:03.890 --> 36:06.051
They're not for
financial trades.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.825
This is a direct
line into the heart of

36:07.890 --> 36:09.426
global trading
through the Stock Exchange.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.492
He's gonna hijack
the world markets.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.561
If you dump
enough data fast enough

36:14.640 --> 36:16.790
into the American
and Pacific exchanges

36:16.870 --> 36:19.930
and the system overloads,
it'd be chaos.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.274
So why run the cables
through the deli?

36:22.340 --> 36:24.205
I don't know.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.271
But I have a feeling
that Patel saw it,

36:26.350 --> 36:28.079
and it's what
got him killed.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.601
Of course,
anything involving schools
or education that I would...

36:51.670 --> 36:54.377
Philippe, can I have
a word with you?

37:04.920 --> 37:06.945
Ms. Oberfeld.
Saru, hey.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.716
Philippe just
sent me down here
to get more champagne.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.429
My task as well.
Of course, please,
let me help you.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.479
Mmm.

37:21.870 --> 37:25.431
That's an interesting
cologne you wear.

37:25.510 --> 37:26.602
Thank you.

37:26.670 --> 37:27.864
There's a perfumer
on Lexington Avenue

37:27.940 --> 37:29.271
who makes it
particularly for me.

37:29.340 --> 37:30.705
No one else in
the world has it.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.271
Now, after you.

37:39.550 --> 37:40.915
Philippe.

37:40.990 --> 37:42.548
Talia, what are you
doing here?

37:42.620 --> 37:43.655
I found her
snooping about, sir.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.721
I was not snooping about.

37:44.790 --> 37:46.724
I was getting
you some champagne

37:46.790 --> 37:48.121
because you said
you were running out.

37:48.190 --> 37:49.327
Talia, how did you
get in?

37:49.400 --> 37:52.028
Well, I just walked
right down the stairs.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.759
All right, fine.
I'm not Talia.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.637
I'm a cop and I'm wired,

38:00.710 --> 38:02.177
and backup's on the way.
And guess what?

38:02.240 --> 38:05.641
You're under investigation
for homicide and terrorism.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.473
All units, move in now.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.643
No. Wait. We need more.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.642
She has a play. Just wait.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.711
What are
you talking about?

38:13.790 --> 38:15.758
I'm talking about
the two men Saru murdered.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.651
I'm talking about
the cyber attack
you're planning

38:17.720 --> 38:19.256
on the world
financial market.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.753
Murder
This is insanity.

38:21.830 --> 38:22.854
Saru, do you know
anything about this?

38:22.930 --> 38:24.056
No, sir, nothing.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.590
I'm calling my lawyer.

38:29.670 --> 38:32.605
What about those cables, hmm?
What about those, Philippe?

38:42.580 --> 38:44.480
I don't know what
those are doing there.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.418
Maybe you know.

38:49.490 --> 38:52.789
They simply allow us
broader data exchange
in overseas trades.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.794
Wait, Manette, I'm no fool.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.350
I know something about
network architecture.

38:56.430 --> 38:58.193
You shut up. For once.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.665
Manette, what
are you doing?

39:00.730 --> 39:02.766
They killed our
parents, Philippe.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.037
They offered us $20,000.
They didn't even fly
their bodies home.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.269
I want them to feel loss.

39:09.340 --> 39:10.773
I want America to feel
what it's like

39:10.840 --> 39:12.899
to have everything
taken away.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.777
How will this
change anything?

39:14.850 --> 39:16.818
I don't care.
I want revenge.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.110
No. Not like this.
Philippe, don't!

39:21.220 --> 39:22.209
All right, go.
Go, go, go.

39:22.290 --> 39:24.155
All units, go.

39:26.190 --> 39:27.179
Drop it!

39:31.430 --> 39:32.624
Drop it.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.638
You okay?

39:49.720 --> 39:50.744
I had him.

39:51.550 --> 39:52.949
Yeah, sure you did.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.313
OFFICER: Go on.

39:58.590 --> 39:59.682
Up the stairs.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.288
All right, let's go.

40:05.370 --> 40:08.567
Oh, I'm sorry.
This way.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.097
Lieutenant, good job.

40:11.170 --> 40:14.037
It is good to see
you and your partner
in one piece.

40:14.110 --> 40:15.202
We do what we can do.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.736
You do.

40:16.810 --> 40:20.439
I had my doubts,
but you did a good job.

40:20.510 --> 40:22.842
The syndicate behind
Manette's plan is really
gonna feel this one.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.184
Mmm-hmm.

40:25.250 --> 40:28.651
Quite an introduction to
Major Crimes. Thank you.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.711
We scare you away already?

40:30.790 --> 40:33.054
No. Are you kidding?

40:33.130 --> 40:35.928
Quite the opposite.
It whets my appetite.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.195
You know I love
a good challenge.

40:43.470 --> 40:44.937
Okay, um, thanks.

40:48.370 --> 40:50.873
Hey, hi.
How you doing?

40:50.940 --> 40:54.546
So, um, even though
I'm not Talia Oberfeld,

40:56.150 --> 40:57.242
I want to say
that you're lovely,

40:57.320 --> 40:59.140
and it was
actually a lot of fun.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.657
Is this your idea of fun?

41:01.720 --> 41:06.054
I can see how getting shot
and me being a cop

41:06.130 --> 41:08.325
might put a damper
on things, you know.

41:08.390 --> 41:12.724
I can't say I've
_ ever seen an_officer
in such a revealing dress.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.119
AL: Don't let her
fool you.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.395
She dresses like this
undercover or not.

41:19.140 --> 41:22.473
So, um, feel better.
They'll take good care of you.

41:22.540 --> 41:25.441
And sorry again.

41:25.510 --> 41:28.445
Seeing as we're
all dressed up,
want to get a drink?

41:28.520 --> 41:30.010
It's 5:00 in
the morning, Al.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.742
Oh, the night is young.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.615
All right.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.527
CARRIE: All right,
go ahead.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.965
What?

41:45.030 --> 41:46.793
You wanna ask me
about Philippe.

41:46.870 --> 41:47.996
You know you want to.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.899
Go on.

41:49.970 --> 41:52.803
Did you really have
to kiss him like that?

41:52.870 --> 41:55.998
Well, he's French,
and the French like to kiss.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.172
French kiss.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.743
And I was undercover,
so I was working.

41:59.810 --> 42:02.870
Funny. It sure
looked real.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.680
Well, maybe it was
kind of real.

42:07.290 --> 42:10.111
What about you
and the captain?
What's up there?

42:10.190 --> 42:12.249
Ancient history.
That's all.

42:13.290 --> 42:14.928
You're gonna
tell me someday.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.527
Yeah, probably. Maybe.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.607
What do you mean
"kind of real"?

42:24.670 --> 42:28.777
I like to kiss
good

42:29.310 --> 42:30.299
Hmm.

42:31.510 --> 42:33.273
Cheers.
Cheers.
