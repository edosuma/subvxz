00:07.126 --> 00:08.358
My name is Sam.

00:08.360 --> 00:09.567
I'm 6 years old.

00:09.573 --> 00:12.262
And tonight I'm supposed
to become a man.

00:13.966 --> 00:15.955
I don't think anyone is in there.

00:15.961 --> 00:17.604
Mom, it's me. I got her.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.543
Where are you?
And why are you whispering?

00:20.267 --> 00:23.106
Mom, you were supposed to watch Sam.

00:23.108 --> 00:24.207
Where is she?

00:24.209 --> 00:26.443
She's in Palm Springs
at a silent retreat.

00:26.445 --> 00:27.706
What?!

00:28.280 --> 00:30.147
No, it was this weekend.

00:30.149 --> 00:32.448
Why don't you go wait in the car, Sammy?

00:32.451 --> 00:34.851
I have the e-mails to prove it.

00:35.551 --> 00:37.921
No, I-I can't hear you when you whisper.

00:37.923 --> 00:39.790
Just forget it. Forget it.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.058
Well, I guess we can't go now.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.367
No, no, no.

00:43.373 --> 00:44.421
We go every year.

00:44.427 --> 00:45.986
Remember, we promised if we had a kid,

00:45.992 --> 00:47.438
it would never change us, right?

00:47.444 --> 00:50.300
We already gave up
Burning Man, Coachella,

00:50.302 --> 00:52.686
Lollapalooza, cocaine...

00:52.692 --> 00:54.070
I don't think that... no!

00:54.072 --> 00:56.540
It's gonna work out fine.
Don't let that sacrifice...

00:56.542 --> 00:58.041
Go on. Mess with me.

00:58.043 --> 00:59.267
I'm gonna...

01:01.480 --> 01:02.846
Pshew.

01:02.848 --> 01:04.281
It's gonna be fine. It's a safe area.

01:04.283 --> 01:05.649
Trust me on this.

01:05.651 --> 01:07.117
Don't let this... Please?

01:07.119 --> 01:08.685
Really?

01:09.788 --> 01:11.221
You did that.

01:12.624 --> 01:15.192
Hey! Guess what, buddy?

01:15.194 --> 01:16.960
You are gonna go to the beach with us.

01:16.962 --> 01:18.862
I thought I was supposed
to stay with Nana?

01:18.864 --> 01:20.497
She was supposed to
teach me bread-making

01:20.499 --> 01:22.199
- and then take me to the...
- No, this'll be better.

01:22.201 --> 01:24.820
This'll be better than that.
This'll be better than that.

01:25.604 --> 01:27.325
Sammy, what did I tell you about

01:27.331 --> 01:28.939
playing with the dolls, man?

01:28.941 --> 01:30.774
You're getting too old for this.

01:30.776 --> 01:32.576
_

01:34.046 --> 01:35.846
Hello.

01:35.848 --> 01:37.147
I'm really sorry.

01:37.149 --> 01:39.216
I could have sworn you said next...

01:42.855 --> 01:44.688
Looking good, Jack!

01:51.964 --> 01:53.697
Please, Vivian, just listen to me...

01:53.699 --> 01:55.232
I'm not dropping the charges, Nikki.

01:55.234 --> 01:57.837
- You stole my credit card.
- No, I didn't...

01:57.843 --> 01:59.336
Tommy, if she doesn't back up off me,

01:59.338 --> 02:00.971
I'm gonna be forced to mace a bitch.

02:00.973 --> 02:02.560
Well, hopefully, we can
resolve this problem

02:02.566 --> 02:04.165
without the use of
violence or the "B" word.

02:04.171 --> 02:06.071
Nikki, please back up off her.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.281
Do you think you can
talk to her on Monday?

02:11.283 --> 02:13.149
You know Beacharoo's
our busiest weekend.

02:13.151 --> 02:14.985
Speaking of which, do
you think your sister

02:14.987 --> 02:16.575
could watch the baby for
an extra couple hours

02:16.581 --> 02:18.188
so you and I can get our jam on?

02:18.190 --> 02:19.623
I've still got that half a joint

02:19.625 --> 02:20.991
I found in the parking lot last year.

02:20.993 --> 02:23.293
I'm facing up to five years in prison.

02:23.295 --> 02:25.331
I just don't think I'll be in the mood.

02:25.337 --> 02:27.006
Well, I thought it might inspire you.

02:27.012 --> 02:29.304
One of the guys from Chumbawamba
is gonna be the emcee.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.176
He got knocked down,
and he got up again.

02:31.182 --> 02:32.649
So can you.

02:34.381 --> 02:36.648
Hey, I'm here to pick up the
keys for Bare Feet Retreat.

02:36.654 --> 02:38.287
Well, I hope you're here
for the music festival.

02:38.289 --> 02:39.655
If not, you picked the wrong weekend.

02:39.657 --> 02:41.162
- It gets a little crazy.
- Oh, no, we're...

02:41.168 --> 02:42.712
We're here for Beacharoo. We might, uh,

02:42.718 --> 02:44.625
look like a couple of boring parents,

02:44.631 --> 02:46.276
but she has a tramp
stamp from Coachella,

02:46.282 --> 02:47.948
and I got my nipple pierced at the mall.

02:47.954 --> 02:50.121
Okay, great. Well, I'll
just find the keys.

02:50.301 --> 02:53.035
So, just to let you know, there's
a shuttle that takes you

02:53.037 --> 02:54.637
from our parking lot to the festival.

02:54.639 --> 02:56.872
It's driven by a really
nice lady named Betty.

02:56.874 --> 02:58.374
But she just got an awful haircut,

02:58.376 --> 02:59.975
so if you pay her a compliment,

02:59.977 --> 03:01.263
I will throw in a free mini muffin

03:01.269 --> 03:02.511
tomorrow at our sunrise brunch.

03:02.513 --> 03:03.546
Okay.

03:03.771 --> 03:06.331
Are we sure he's old enough for this?

03:06.337 --> 03:07.917
He still sucks his thumb.

03:07.919 --> 03:10.019
That's exactly why this is a good idea.

03:10.021 --> 03:12.021
The boy has got to grow up sometime.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.197
I think we're gonna have
to do it with the car.

03:21.199 --> 03:23.426
Yeah, I thought maybe this would work,

03:23.432 --> 03:25.031
but it's not enough juice.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.724
I better get this thing back
to the church parking lot

03:27.730 --> 03:29.029
before mass gets out.

03:29.507 --> 03:31.407
I need to go to work
for a couple of hours.

03:31.409 --> 03:33.576
Are we still going to go
over to the festival tonight

03:33.578 --> 03:35.003
to sell squirts of hand sanitizer

03:35.009 --> 03:37.279
- for a dollar a squirt?
- I hope so.

03:37.281 --> 03:38.657
Yeah, if we get there early enough,

03:38.663 --> 03:40.229
we can set up by the port-a-potties.

03:40.235 --> 03:42.223
The second those things
run out of toilet paper,

03:42.229 --> 03:44.086
it's gonna be a gold mine.

03:45.255 --> 03:47.825
I'm just saying I don't
think he's ready for this.

03:48.492 --> 03:50.559
Moms always think their kids
aren't ready for stuff.

03:50.561 --> 03:51.820
My mom didn't think I was ready

03:51.826 --> 03:53.242
for kindergarten, so I didn't go.

03:53.248 --> 03:55.698
And that's why I still have
trouble naming shapes.

03:56.961 --> 03:58.270
Sam?

03:59.096 --> 04:00.396
Hey, buddy.

04:00.607 --> 04:04.704
Hey, tonight is a big
night for you, okay?

04:04.710 --> 04:09.338
Tonight you get to stay
here all by yourself!

04:09.340 --> 04:10.673
What?

04:10.675 --> 04:12.402
Yeah, you get to stay by yourself.

04:12.408 --> 04:14.341
Your mother thought about
hiring a babysitter,

04:14.343 --> 04:16.010
but we don't know anyone at the beach,

04:16.012 --> 04:18.108
and I don't feel comfortable
leaving you with a stranger.

04:18.115 --> 04:20.748
- So, no babysitter?
- Nope.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.915
No babysitter,

04:21.916 --> 04:24.418
because you are not a baby anymore.

04:24.420 --> 04:25.855
What am I gonna do?

04:25.861 --> 04:27.766
How will I know when to go to bed?

04:27.772 --> 04:30.290
- What will I eat?
- Your mom's ordering dinner,

04:30.292 --> 04:32.096
and your mom and I

04:32.102 --> 04:34.124
are gonna be out till way past

04:34.130 --> 04:36.363
when the big hand
high-fives the little hand.

04:36.365 --> 04:39.967
So that means you get to
make your own bedtime.

04:39.969 --> 04:42.803
Wait, why can't I go to
the music thing with you?

04:42.805 --> 04:44.253
The music festival?

04:44.259 --> 04:45.873
Uh, you're not old enough.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.741
But I'm old enough to stay alone?

04:47.743 --> 04:49.376
Yeah! We Googled it.

04:49.378 --> 04:51.212
Only three states have laws

04:51.218 --> 04:52.450
regarding the minimum age

04:52.456 --> 04:53.922
for a child to be left home alone...

04:53.928 --> 04:55.916
Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon.

04:55.918 --> 04:58.452
Everywhere else it's up to
the parents' discretion!

04:58.454 --> 05:00.621
♪

05:00.623 --> 05:02.156
Hey. Come on.

05:02.158 --> 05:04.024
What did I tell you about that?

05:04.026 --> 05:05.192
Pacifiers are for babies,

05:05.194 --> 05:06.794
and that includes your thumb.

05:06.796 --> 05:08.195
Come on, buddy.

05:08.197 --> 05:10.030
Mom and dad don't get very
many chances to have fun.

05:10.032 --> 05:11.532
So don't ruin this for us.

05:17.473 --> 05:19.273
He's excited!

05:20.543 --> 05:22.676
Our cellphone number's on a
piece of paper by the phone,

05:22.678 --> 05:24.011
and the food should be here soon.

05:24.013 --> 05:25.312
Daddy's gonna put some
money on the counter.

05:25.314 --> 05:27.430
And don't forget to brush teeth.

05:27.436 --> 05:29.650
Honey, he'll be fine. Look at him.

05:29.652 --> 05:31.251
Tonight he's our little boy.

05:31.253 --> 05:33.620
Tomorrow he'll be our little man.

05:33.622 --> 05:35.189
See you in the morning, buddy.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:51.390 --> 05:52.456
I got to go.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.825
Hello. Are your parents home?

05:54.827 --> 05:56.961
No. It's just me.

05:56.963 --> 05:58.128
Come in.

06:05.972 --> 06:07.137
No tip?

06:07.139 --> 06:08.733
That's all they left me.

06:09.342 --> 06:11.609
W-Wait, I have some money in my luggage.

06:17.650 --> 06:20.958
- Hello?
- Hey, I got the van started.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.363
Warm up your squirting finger

06:22.365 --> 06:24.332
and meet me at the Beacharoo entrance

06:24.334 --> 06:26.601
on the corner of Pier Ave and Sullivan.

06:26.603 --> 06:27.869
Got it.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.614
I got a bunch of money.

06:31.620 --> 06:34.755
My Nana was gonna take me to the arcade.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.014
Good looking out!

06:56.966 --> 06:59.200
You've found me.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.971
Aah! Aah!

07:33.668 --> 07:36.387
_

07:42.278 --> 07:44.979
I almost wore those exact PJs.

07:58.264 --> 08:00.529
You have reached the
desk of Shyrell Vance.

08:00.535 --> 08:02.363
Push 7 to leave a message.

08:02.369 --> 08:05.608
If this is an emergency, press
8 to reach me on my cell.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.389
You got Shyrell.

08:09.395 --> 08:11.235
Hi, I sent in a sample to you guys

08:11.241 --> 08:12.498
for a paternity test,

08:12.504 --> 08:14.337
and I need to change the
address that I gave you.

08:14.343 --> 08:16.184
You pressed 8 for that?

08:16.190 --> 08:17.966
Sugar, that's not an emergency.

08:17.972 --> 08:19.605
That's something that can
be handled on Monday,

08:19.611 --> 08:21.912
when I'm not about to watch
"Shark Tank" with my boo.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.959
If your boo could find the remote.

08:23.965 --> 08:26.300
Okay, no, this is an
emergency, trust me.

08:26.347 --> 08:27.847
If I don't change the address,

08:27.853 --> 08:29.293
the results will get sent to a woman

08:29.299 --> 08:30.631
who's really pissed at me right now,

08:30.637 --> 08:32.293
and... and she'd probably tell my fiancé

08:32.294 --> 08:33.681
and it would ruin my whole life.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.534
She sounds like a bitch.

08:35.541 --> 08:36.774
Who's a bitch?

08:36.780 --> 08:38.479
What's your name?

08:38.485 --> 08:39.852
Nikki Gooze.

08:39.857 --> 08:41.424
Oh, my Gosh, thank you so much.

08:41.442 --> 08:43.719
- You are seriously saving m...
- They sent it already.

08:43.725 --> 08:45.858
- What?
- It got put in the mail yesterday.

08:45.864 --> 08:47.709
What got put in the mail yesterday.

08:47.715 --> 08:49.948
Shit! Can you just tell
me the results, then?

08:49.950 --> 08:51.750
I cannot tell you the
results over the phone.

08:51.752 --> 08:53.085
Confidentiality laws.

08:53.087 --> 08:54.419
Okay, but I won't tell on you,

08:54.421 --> 08:55.921
so who's gonna know you broke any laws?

08:55.923 --> 08:57.760
Have you ever heard of the government?

08:57.766 --> 08:59.855
The NSA? Edward Snowman?

09:00.127 --> 09:03.495
Hello, whoever's listening,
I know you're there,

09:03.497 --> 09:05.915
and Shyrell Vance ain't
breaking no laws.

09:07.468 --> 09:08.667
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:08.669 --> 09:10.369
I'm gonna go watch rich
people make poor people cry.

09:10.371 --> 09:12.204
No, no, no!

09:14.008 --> 09:16.375
I will trade you a blow
job for a foot rub.

09:16.377 --> 09:17.609
Deal.

09:17.611 --> 09:21.680
But, wait, let me pause it
so Mark Cuban can watch.

09:27.184 --> 09:29.254
I think we might be able to squeeze

09:29.256 --> 09:30.989
a few more squirts out of this one.

09:49.810 --> 09:51.043
Thanks.

09:51.045 --> 09:52.411
He really thought you were...

09:52.413 --> 09:55.013
- Follow me, man.
- No way, man.

09:57.647 --> 09:59.484
Got my last squirt, buddy.

09:59.486 --> 10:01.353
We should have brought more sanitizer.

10:01.355 --> 10:03.488
People are way filthier than last year.

10:06.226 --> 10:08.427
Don't do it. Do not call him.

10:08.429 --> 10:11.263
- What if he's scared?
- If he's scared, he'll call us.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.931
If you call him now, you're
just gonna wake him up.

10:12.933 --> 10:14.166
It's past 9:00 p.m.

10:14.168 --> 10:15.600
The kid passes out wherever he is.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.660
That was fun.

10:23.087 --> 10:25.364
Working in large crowds
with sweaty, half-naked people

10:25.370 --> 10:27.379
makes me feel bad
about my life's choices.

10:27.381 --> 10:28.647
I hear you.

10:28.649 --> 10:31.149
Not my favorite weekend at the beach.

10:31.151 --> 10:32.951
Hey, you want to go on a road trip?

10:32.953 --> 10:35.721
Sure. How about the mountains?

10:42.396 --> 10:44.696
Whoo! Yeah!

10:47.067 --> 10:48.500
Party wolf!

10:56.146 --> 10:58.012
Oh, it's back. It's back.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.472
Lower.

10:59.755 --> 11:00.988
Higher.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.408
Left.

11:02.410 --> 11:03.843
Lefter.

11:03.845 --> 11:06.412
You're chasing it all around.

11:11.353 --> 11:12.485
Okay.

11:12.487 --> 11:13.920
All good choices.

11:15.891 --> 11:17.891
Please, will you just
listen to me for...

11:24.132 --> 11:26.800
Jesus! You're like Lady Pac-Man.

11:26.802 --> 11:28.880
I could go away for five years, Vivian.

11:28.894 --> 11:32.196
I won't be able to read my son a
bedtime story for five years.

11:32.202 --> 11:34.802
Well, at least you'll have
something to look forward to.

11:34.804 --> 11:36.971
All I have to look forward
to in my shitty life

11:36.973 --> 11:38.873
was the arrival of my new credit card.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.608
And you tried to take that away from me

11:40.610 --> 11:42.143
so you could buy cute
shoes and look all cute

11:42.145 --> 11:43.644
for your cute, little fiancé

11:43.646 --> 11:46.380
and make your whole cute,
disgusting life better?

11:46.382 --> 11:48.916
Excuse me while I barf a shit rainbow!

11:50.320 --> 11:53.287
Look, I wasn't trying
to steal your credit card.

11:53.289 --> 11:54.822
Okay?

11:57.727 --> 11:59.460
I sent away for some test results

11:59.462 --> 12:01.162
that I didn't want Tommy to see,

12:01.164 --> 12:02.797
so I used your address.

12:02.799 --> 12:04.597
I wasn't looking for your mail.

12:04.603 --> 12:06.033
I was looking for mine.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.002
What kind of test results?

12:10.073 --> 12:11.505
DNA.

12:11.507 --> 12:14.581
- I'm not sure he's the baby's father.
- Oh, shit!

12:14.587 --> 12:16.944
I know, so please, just don't
tell him, okay? don't tell him.

12:16.946 --> 12:18.613
I-I-I-I don't know what I'd
do if the baby's not...

12:18.615 --> 12:21.415
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm
not gonna say anything.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.251
Really?

12:23.253 --> 12:25.519
Yeah, I'm all about girl power.

12:25.521 --> 12:27.255
Women's lib, Time's Up,

12:27.257 --> 12:29.457
Pound Me Too... All that shit.

12:29.459 --> 12:30.901
Look, I'll say whatever you want to

12:30.907 --> 12:33.394
- the police so you don't go to jail.
- Oh, my God.

12:33.396 --> 12:35.396
Thank you so much.

12:35.398 --> 12:37.322
Um, and when the DNA test comes,

12:37.328 --> 12:39.257
just call me and I'll
come pick up, okay?

12:39.263 --> 12:42.036
Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on a second.

12:42.038 --> 12:43.871
Come on, you can't leave
me hanging like that.

12:43.873 --> 12:44.972
Give me the dirt.

12:44.974 --> 12:46.674
Who else do you think
the father might be?

12:46.676 --> 12:48.608
Oh. I don't think I should...

12:48.614 --> 12:51.212
Tell your new best friend who is
awesome at keeping secrets?

12:53.216 --> 12:54.682
Bodhi.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.553
You had sex with Bodhi?

12:59.555 --> 13:01.589
Yeah, I mean, it was at a party.

13:01.591 --> 13:03.324
There was, like, lots of drinking.

13:03.326 --> 13:04.759
There was ecstasy involved.

13:04.761 --> 13:06.927
Uh, did... did he ever...
Did he happen to mention

13:06.929 --> 13:08.729
if you were, like, his physical type,

13:08.731 --> 13:10.798
or if he was open to,
say, like, I don't know,

13:10.800 --> 13:12.433
like, the exact opposite of you?

13:12.435 --> 13:14.470
I don't know. I actually
don't remember much.

13:14.476 --> 13:16.304
Honestly, I tried to forget about it,

13:16.306 --> 13:17.905
But then I missed my period

13:17.907 --> 13:20.374
and then Tommy walked in on
me taking a pregnancy test.

13:20.376 --> 13:23.177
And then he dropped to
one knee and proposed.

13:23.179 --> 13:25.946
And, you know what?
For all I know, it's his, so...

13:25.948 --> 13:27.080
Nikki!

13:27.086 --> 13:29.165
We got a woman in your section
with, uh, winky emojis

13:29.171 --> 13:31.052
painted on her boobs asking
where her omelet is.

13:31.054 --> 13:32.504
She's pretty sweaty. We should get her

13:32.510 --> 13:33.954
in and out while she's still decent.

13:33.956 --> 13:36.891
Okay. Um, coming, sweetie!

13:38.494 --> 13:41.028
Thank you so much.

13:41.030 --> 13:44.732
Just let me know when the
results come in, okay?

13:44.734 --> 13:46.033
Yeah.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.194
You bet.

13:59.482 --> 14:02.018
You're sure we're going
in the right direction now?

14:02.024 --> 14:03.766
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

14:03.772 --> 14:05.948
I thought you knew how
to get to the mountains.

14:05.954 --> 14:07.577
Nah. I was just turning every

14:07.583 --> 14:09.423
time I saw a road going uphill.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.058
Kitty cat!

14:15.298 --> 14:16.831
You're the home-alone kid.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.399
What, from the old movie?

14:18.401 --> 14:19.566
No way.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.168
I just saw a picture of
that kid in a magazine.

14:21.170 --> 14:23.637
- He's like 80 now.
- Not Mackenzie Clemwich.

14:23.639 --> 14:25.524
This kid was actually home alone.

14:25.530 --> 14:26.849
What are you doing in here?

14:26.855 --> 14:28.170
I think I fell asleep when I was

14:28.176 --> 14:29.526
trying to get my action figure.

14:29.532 --> 14:31.866
My dad must have taken it
with him and dropped it.

14:32.095 --> 14:33.394
That's mine, buddy.

14:33.654 --> 14:35.784
Look, his foot's all
banged up from where I

14:35.790 --> 14:38.112
have him kick the shit
out of his arch-enemies.

14:38.671 --> 14:40.121
You play with action figures?

14:40.123 --> 14:41.163
Yeah.

14:41.169 --> 14:42.623
They're cooler than Hot Wheels

14:42.625 --> 14:44.024
and not as labor-intensive as Legos.

14:44.026 --> 14:45.726
I think we should find your parents.

14:45.728 --> 14:47.128
Even though you and I have history

14:47.130 --> 14:48.793
with me delivering you chicken and such,

14:48.799 --> 14:50.389
if we get pulled over with a missing

14:50.395 --> 14:51.993
child in the back of our van,

14:52.268 --> 14:53.934
I predict a lot of mayhem,

14:53.936 --> 14:55.436
and quite possibly some tazing

14:55.438 --> 14:56.537
before the truth surfaces.

15:05.548 --> 15:07.716
You're gonna smoke right now?

15:08.223 --> 15:09.603
It's medicinal.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.221
What I thought was going to be

15:11.227 --> 15:12.660
a tranquil drive to the mountains

15:12.666 --> 15:15.000
has developed into an
accidental kidnapping.

15:18.561 --> 15:20.995
I hope this smoke isn't
getting back there.

15:20.997 --> 15:23.898
You're not suddenly hungry
for no reason, are you?

15:23.900 --> 15:24.965
No.

15:26.769 --> 15:29.303
You're a brave little dude
to be out all by yourself.

15:29.305 --> 15:31.605
First time my parents
left me home alone,

15:31.607 --> 15:33.574
I hid under the covers the whole time.

15:33.576 --> 15:35.497
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

15:35.503 --> 15:36.932
We had a water heater in the basement

15:36.938 --> 15:38.204
that sounded like a ghost.

15:39.916 --> 15:41.449
Hey, man!

15:41.556 --> 15:42.788
What did I tell you about

15:42.794 --> 15:44.127
making ghost sounds when I'm high?

15:44.159 --> 15:45.525
But I like making ghost sounds,

15:45.527 --> 15:46.993
and you're always high,

15:46.995 --> 15:49.062
which leaves me no window
to make ghost sounds.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.724
Ghosts aren't real.

15:50.730 --> 15:52.298
How do you know?

15:52.300 --> 15:54.300
- My dad told me.
- See?

15:54.302 --> 15:56.336
Even the little boy knows you're crazy.

16:01.105 --> 16:02.892
Okay, Mr. Ghost Expert.

16:02.898 --> 16:04.611
What are your views on Santa Claus?

16:04.613 --> 16:05.814
He comes down the chimney and

16:05.820 --> 16:07.347
leaves you presents if you're good.

16:07.349 --> 16:09.415
- That's bullshit.
- Hey, man!

16:13.410 --> 16:15.855
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

16:15.857 --> 16:17.188
What are you doing?

16:17.194 --> 16:19.259
You can't tell a kid
there's no Santa Claus.

16:19.261 --> 16:21.427
Okay, first of all, I'm high.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.790
You have to take that into account
when judging my behavior.

16:23.796 --> 16:25.827
- Fair enough.
- And second of all,

16:25.833 --> 16:27.233
you guys were ganging up on me.

16:27.239 --> 16:29.357
- My back was against the wall.
- That's true.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.122
We were ganging up on you.
That's my bad.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.798
Let me hit that.

16:39.339 --> 16:40.643
I just want you

16:40.649 --> 16:42.149
to get over your fear of ghosts

16:42.155 --> 16:44.106
so you don't have to sleep
with the dome light on.

16:44.311 --> 16:47.235
We can't keep jump-sing every morning.

17:27.984 --> 17:30.051
- Kid?
- _

17:30.057 --> 17:31.457
Where are you?

17:31.463 --> 17:32.927
Hope he's not doing something bad

17:32.933 --> 17:34.828
now that he knows Santa
Claus isn't watching.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.396
If his parents are religious,

17:36.398 --> 17:37.964
he still has all the Jesus bullshit

17:37.966 --> 17:40.433
to keep him on the straight
and narrow for a while.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.068
Wait a second. There's no Jesus?

17:42.364 --> 17:44.473
At what age do they tell you that?

17:54.479 --> 17:55.678
My name is Sam.

17:55.684 --> 17:56.974
I'm 6 years old.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.486
And tonight I'm supposed
to become a man.

18:05.761 --> 18:09.396
My dad says being a man
means a lot of things.

18:10.273 --> 18:11.884
You're not supposed to suck

18:11.890 --> 18:13.733
your thumb or use a pacifier.

18:13.735 --> 18:14.932
That's mine, buddy.

18:14.938 --> 18:17.137
You're not supposed to
play with action figures.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.048
And you're not supposed to be scared.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.407
Hey, man!

18:20.409 --> 18:21.984
What did I tell you about making

18:21.990 --> 18:23.410
ghost sounds when I'm high?

18:23.412 --> 18:25.745
But grown-ups do all those things.

18:25.747 --> 18:27.447
So maybe my dad was wrong.

18:30.385 --> 18:34.087
Maybe you can do all
that and still be a man.

18:34.089 --> 18:36.256
Maybe I was already a man.

18:37.292 --> 18:39.225
The only thing I know for sure

18:39.227 --> 18:41.561
is I'm never going to smoke drugs

18:41.563 --> 18:42.996
'cause they mess up your brain

18:42.998 --> 18:45.231
and make you think
Santa Claus isn't real.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.808
See?

18:54.810 --> 18:57.177
Told you he'd be fine.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.313
He smells a little like weed, though.

19:00.315 --> 19:02.515
Probably 'cause we left the window open.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.853
You were right.

19:03.859 --> 19:05.568
I guess it's just hard for me to accept

19:05.574 --> 19:07.141
my little boy is growing up.

19:07.889 --> 19:09.789
He sure drew a lot of pictures.
