00:04.440 --> 00:05.520
'Bye!

00:07.000 --> 00:08.880
'Consulting criminal.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.200
'I have loved this,
this little game of ours.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.960
'People have died.
That's what people DO!'

00:22.320 --> 00:23.400
' will stop you.'

00:24.800 --> 00:26.640
If you don't stop prying...

00:28.400 --> 00:29.560
I'll burn you.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.560
I will burn the heart out of you.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.580
Catch you later.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.120
No, you won't!

00:47.520 --> 00:48.879
Sorry, boys!

00:48.880 --> 00:50.639
I'm SO changeable!

00:51.640 --> 00:53.080
It is a weakness with me,

00:53.081 --> 00:56.439
but to be fair to myself,
it is my only weakness.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.320
You can't be allowed to continue.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.759
You just can't.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.359
I would try to convince you,

01:03.360 --> 01:08.040
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.720
Probably my answer
has crossed yours.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.919
Do you mind if I get that?

01:53.920 --> 01:55.599
No, please.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.040
You've got the rest of your life.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.920
Hello?

02:03.840 --> 02:05.640
Yes, of course it is.
What do you want?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.080
SAY THAT AGAIN!

02:13.880 --> 02:17.679
Say that again, and know that
if you're lying to me,

02:17.680 --> 02:21.460
I will find you,
and I will skin you.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.880
Wait.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.639
Sorry...

02:42.640 --> 02:44.799
Wrong day to die.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.600
Did you get a better offer?

02:51.920 --> 02:54.600
You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.000
So if you have what you say you
have, I will make you rich.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.679
If you don't,

03:07.680 --> 03:10.759
I'll make you into shoes.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.840
What happened there?

03:27.760 --> 03:29.560
Someone changed his mind.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.440
The question is...

03:33.880 --> 03:35.240
who?

03:36.800 --> 03:40.159
Well, now, have you been wicked,
Your Highness?

03:40.160 --> 03:42.760
Yes, Miss Adler.

What are you typing?

04:28.120 --> 04:30.519
Blog. About? Us.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.479
You mean me. Why?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.920
Well, you're typing a lot.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.399
Right, then.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.000
So, what have we got?

04:41.400 --> 04:45.999
My wife seems to be spending a very
long time at the office. Boring.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.280
I think my husband might be
having an affair. Yes.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.399
She's not my real aunt,
she's been replaced.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.440
I know she has.

04:54.441 --> 04:56.879
I know human ash. Leave.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.519
We are prepared to offer any
sum of money you care to mention

05:00.520 --> 05:02.679
for the recovery
of these files. Boring.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.119
We have this website, it explains
the true meaning of comic books,

05:06.120 --> 05:08.159
cos people miss a lot of the themes.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.079
But then all the comic books
started coming true.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.720
Interesting.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.319
Geek Interpreter, what's that?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.640
That's the title.
What does it need a title for?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.839
Do people actually read your blog?

05:25.840 --> 05:28.719
Where do you think our clients
come from? I have a website.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.020
In which you enumerate 240
different types of tobacco ash.

05:31.021 --> 05:33.319
Nobody's reading your website.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.759
Right then, dyed blonde hair,
no obvious cause of death,

05:37.760 --> 05:40.680
except for these speckles,
whatever they are.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.319
For God's sakes!

05:47.320 --> 05:49.600
What? The Speckled Blonde?!

05:52.680 --> 05:55.559
They wouldn't let us see
Granddad when he was dead.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.519
Is that cos he'd gone to heaven?

05:57.520 --> 05:59.799
People don't really go to heaven
when they die,

05:59.800 --> 06:01.919
they're taken to a
special room and burned.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.719
Sherlock...

06:03.720 --> 06:06.399
There was a plane
crash in Dusseldorf yesterday.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.959
Everyone dead.
Suspected terrorist bomb.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.719
We do watch the news.
You said "boring" and turned over.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.199
Well, according to the flight details,
this man was checked in on board.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.319
Inside his coat he's got a stub from his
boarding pass, napkins from the flight,

06:19.320 --> 06:21.080
even one of those special biscuits.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.479
Here's his passport,
stamped at Berlin Airport.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.199
So this man should have died in a
plane crash in Germany yesterday,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.359
but instead he's in a car boot
in Southwark.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.119
Lucky escape.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.519
Any ideas?

06:32.520 --> 06:34.240
Eight so far.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.680
OK, four ideas.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.960
Maybe two ideas.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.759
No, no, no,
don't mention the unsolved ones.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.359
People want to know you're human.
Why?

06:53.360 --> 06:55.460
Because they're interested.
No, they're not.

06:55.461 --> 06:57.559
Why are they? look at that.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.199
1,895. Sorry, what?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.400
I reset that counter last night.
This blog has

07:02.401 --> 07:04.599
had nearly 2,000 hits in
the last eight hours.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.679
This is your living, Sherlock, not
240 different types of tobacco ash.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.400
243.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.759
So what's this one?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.359
Belly Button Murders?

07:16.360 --> 07:17.520
The Navel Treatment?

07:19.680 --> 07:23.279
There's a lot of press outside, guys.
Well, they won't be interested in us.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.319
Yeah, that was before you were
an internet phenomenon.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.039
A couple of them specifically wanted
photographs of you two.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.080
God's sake!

07:32.560 --> 07:33.840
John?

07:34.880 --> 07:37.359
Cover your face and walk fast.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.879
Still, it's good for the public
image,

07:39.880 --> 07:41.279
big case like this.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.280
I'm a private detective, the last
thing I need is a public image.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.239
Hello.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.200
I think it's time, don't you?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.039
Dear!

08:48.040 --> 08:49.400
Thumbs!?

08:51.840 --> 08:54.199
The door was...

08:54.200 --> 08:55.920
The door was...

08:59.000 --> 09:02.160
Boys! You've got another one!

09:09.280 --> 09:14.679
Tell us from the start,
DON'T be boring.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.999
Hey!

10:11.000 --> 10:12.040
Are you OK?

10:14.520 --> 10:15.759
Excuse me!

10:15.760 --> 10:17.240
Are you all right?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.480
Sir, phone call for you.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.679
Carter.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.039
'Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?'
Who?

10:35.040 --> 10:37.420
Well, you're about
to meet him now.

10:37.421 --> 10:39.799
This is your case, it's entirely
up to you, this is just...

10:39.800 --> 10:43.359
'..friendly advice, but give Sherlock
five minutes on your crime scene,

10:43.360 --> 10:47.119
'and listen to everything that he has
to say. And as far as possible... '

10:47.120 --> 10:48.520
try not to punch him.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.759
OK.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.319
Sir, this gentleman says he needs
to speak to you... Yes, I know.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.679
Sherlock Holmes.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.360
John Watson. Are you set up
for wi-fi?

10:59.680 --> 11:03.999
'You realise this is
a tiny bit humiliating?'

11:04.000 --> 11:06.199
It's OK, I'm fine.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.679
Now...

11:07.680 --> 11:08.840
show me to the stream.

11:08.841 --> 11:11.479
'I didn't really mean for you.'

11:11.480 --> 11:13.000
Look, this is a six.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.540
There's no point in my
leaving the flat for

11:16.541 --> 11:18.759
anything less than a
seven, we agreed.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.479
Now go back,

11:20.480 --> 11:21.518
show me the grass.

11:21.519 --> 11:22.720
When did we agree that?

11:22.721 --> 11:25.319
We agreed it yesterday. Stop!

11:25.320 --> 11:29.359
'Closer.' I wasn't even at home
yesterday. I was in Dublin.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.040
It's hardly my fault
you weren't listening.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.860
Shut up! 'Do you just carry
on talking when I'm away?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.999
' I don't know, how
often are you away?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.039
'Now...

11:38.040 --> 11:40.399
'..show me the car that backfired.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.839
It's there.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.880
'That's the one that made the noise,
yes?'

11:45.040 --> 11:46.079
Yeah.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.159
If you're thinking gunshot...
'..there wasn't one.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.400
'He wasn't shot,

11:50.401 --> 11:54.839
'he was killed by a single blow
to the back from a blunt instrument,

11:54.840 --> 11:58.439
'which then magically disappeared,
along with the killer.'

11:58.440 --> 12:00.119
It's got to be an eight, at least.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.500
You've got two more minutes,
they want to know more

12:02.501 --> 12:04.879
about the driver.
Forget him, he's an idiot.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.999
Why else would he think himself a
suspect? I think he's a suspect.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.519
'Pass me over.' All right, but there's
a mute button, and I will use it.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.119
Up a bit!
I'm not talking from down here!

12:15.120 --> 12:16.679
OK. Just take it, take it.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.479
'Having successfully committed
a crime without a single witness... '

12:20.480 --> 12:23.199
why would he call the police
and consult a detective?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.799
Fair play? He's trying to be clever.
It's overconfidence.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.380
Did you see him?
Morbidly obese, the undisguised

12:29.381 --> 12:31.959
halitosis of a single
man living on his own.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.380
The right sleeve of an
internet porn addict, the

12:34.381 --> 12:36.799
breathing pattern of an
untreated heart condition.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.200
Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and
a limited life expectancy,

12:39.201 --> 12:41.599
and you think he's a
criminal mastermind?!

12:41.600 --> 12:44.719
Don't worry, this is just stupid.
What did you say? Heart what?

12:44.720 --> 12:45.880
Go to the stream.

12:45.881 --> 12:47.679
What's in the stream?

12:47.680 --> 12:51.399
Go and see. Sherlock!
You weren't answering your doorbell.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.620
His room's through the back,
get him some clothes.

12:53.621 --> 12:55.839
Who the hell are you?
Sorry, Mr Holmes...

12:55.840 --> 12:58.460
'Sherlock, what's going on?
' You're coming with us.

12:58.461 --> 13:01.079
'What's happening?' I've lost him.
I don't know what...

13:01.080 --> 13:05.280
Dr Watson? Yeah. It's for you.
OK, thanks. No, sir, the helicopter.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.080
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're
going you'll want to be dressed.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.400
I know exactly where I'm going.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.600
You wearing any pants? No. OK.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.279
At Buckingham Palace. Right.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.679
Ha, ha. Aah, aah, I am seriously
fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray.

15:06.800 --> 15:11.439
What are we doing here, Sherlock,
seriously, what? I don't know.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.919
Here to see the Queen?

15:13.920 --> 15:15.920
Apparently, yes.

15:18.840 --> 15:22.479
Just once,
can you two behave like grown-ups?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.680
We solve crimes, I blog about
it, and he forgets his pants.

15:24.681 --> 15:26.879
I wouldn't hold out
too much hope.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.759
I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.
What, the hiker and the backfire?

15:30.760 --> 15:32.900
I glanced at the police report,
a bit obvious, surely?

15:32.901 --> 15:35.039
Transparent.
Time to move on then.

15:38.160 --> 15:43.279
We are in Buckingham Palace, the
very heart of the British nation.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.919
Sherlock Holmes,
put your trousers on! What for?

15:46.920 --> 15:48.519
Your client.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.719
And my client is...?

15:50.720 --> 15:53.479
Illustrious, in the extreme.

15:53.480 --> 15:58.599
And remaining, I have to inform you,
entirely anonymous.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.039
Mycroft. Harry.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.580
May I just apologise for the
state of my little brother.

16:02.581 --> 16:05.119
A full-time occupation,
I imagine.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.740
And this must be Dr John
Watson, formerly of the

16:07.741 --> 16:10.359
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers?
Hello, yes.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.199
My employer is a tremendous
fan of your blog. Your employer?

16:14.200 --> 16:18.559
Particularly enjoyed the one about the
aluminium crutch. Thank you...

16:18.560 --> 16:20.839
And Mr Holmes the Younger.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.120
You look taller in
your photographs.

16:23.121 --> 16:25.399
I take the precaution of a
good coat and a short friend.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.639
Mycroft, I don't do
anonymous clients.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.000
I'm used to mystery at
one end of my cases,

16:30.001 --> 16:32.360
both ends is too much work.
Good morning.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.839
This is a matter of national
importance. Grow up!

16:37.840 --> 16:39.599
Get off my sheet! Or what?

16:39.600 --> 16:41.199
Or I'll just walk away.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.919
I'll let you.
Boys, please... Not here.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.199
Who is my client?

16:47.200 --> 16:50.879
Take a look at where you're
standing, and make a deduction.

16:50.880 --> 16:55.399
You are to be engaged by the highest
in the land, now, for God's sake!

16:55.400 --> 16:57.919
Put your clothes on!

17:01.200 --> 17:03.319
I'll be mother.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.119
And there is a whole
childhood in a nutshell.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.920
My employer has a problem.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.420
A matter has come to
light of an extremely

17:15.421 --> 17:17.878
delicate and potentially
criminal nature,

17:17.880 --> 17:22.239
and in this hour of need, dear
brother, your name has arisen. Why?

17:22.240 --> 17:25.439
We have a police force of sorts,
even a marginally secret service.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.740
Why come to me?
People come to you for help, don't

17:27.741 --> 17:30.039
they, Mr Holmes?
Not to date anyone with a navy.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.479
This is a matter of the highest
security, and therefore of trust.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.479
You don't trust your own
secret service? Naturally not.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.479
They all spy on people for money.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.560
I do think we have a timetable.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.200
Yes, of course...

17:45.200 --> 17:47.000
What do you know about this woman?

17:51.160 --> 17:52.879
Nothing whatsoever.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.799
Then you should be paying more
attention.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.879
She's been at the centre of two
political scandals in the last year,

18:00.880 --> 18:04.519
and recently ended the marriage
of a prominent novelist

18:04.520 --> 18:08.599
by having an affair
with both participants separately.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.439
You know I don't concern myself
with trivia.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.760
Who is she?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.919
Irene Adler.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.359
Professionally known as "The Woman".

18:19.360 --> 18:20.719
Professionally?

18:20.720 --> 18:25.240
There are many names for what
she does. She prefers "dominatrix".

18:30.800 --> 18:32.959
Dominatrix. Don't be alarmed.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.439
It's to do with sex.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.840
Sex doesn't alarm me.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.519
How would you know?

18:39.520 --> 18:42.079
She provides, shall we say,
recreational scolding

18:42.080 --> 18:44.119
for those who enjoy
that sort of thing

18:44.120 --> 18:46.119
and are prepared to pay for it.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.880
These are all from her website.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.359
And I assume this Adler woman has
some compromising photographs.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.839
You're very quick, Mr Holmes.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.680
Hardly a difficult deduction.
Photographs of whom?

19:24.960 --> 19:26.999
A person of significance
to my employer.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.080
We'd prefer not to say
any more at this time.

19:29.081 --> 19:31.160
You can't tell us anything?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.640
I can tell you it's a young person.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.440
A young female person.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.439
How many photographs?

19:43.440 --> 19:45.359
A considerable number, apparently.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.540
Do Miss Adler and this
young female person

19:47.541 --> 19:49.719
appear in these photographs
together? Yes.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.880
I assume in a number of
compromising scenarios?

19:51.881 --> 19:54.039
An imaginative range,
we are assured.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.719
John, you might want to put that cup
back in your saucer now.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.079
Can you help us, Mr Holmes? How?
Will you take the case?

20:01.080 --> 20:02.119
What case?

20:02.120 --> 20:03.919
Pay her, now and in full.

20:03.920 --> 20:08.239
As Miss Adler remarks in her
masthead, know when you are beaten.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.160
She doesn't want anything.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.600
She got in touch.

20:12.601 --> 20:15.079
She informed us that the
photographs existed.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.839
She indicated that she had no
intention to use them

20:17.840 --> 20:20.759
to extort either money or favour.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.959
A power play.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.959
A power play with the most powerful
family in Britain.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.519
Now that is a dominatrix. This
is getting rather fun, isn't it.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.559
Sherlock... Where is she?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.900
In London, currently.
She's staying...

20:33.901 --> 20:36.239
Text me the details, I'll be in
touch by the end of the day.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.260
Do you really think
you'll have news by then?

20:38.261 --> 20:40.279
No, I think I'll have
the photographs.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.920
One can only hope
you're as good as you seem to think.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.040
I'll need some
equipment, of course.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.999
Anything you require,
I'll have it sent...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.220
Can I have a box of matches?
I'm sorry?

20:53.221 --> 20:55.439
Or your cigarette lighter,
either will do.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.240
I don't smoke. No, I know you don't,
but your employer does.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.279
We have kept a lot of people
successfully in the dark

21:03.280 --> 21:05.359
about this little fact, Mr Holmes.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.559
I'm not the Commonwealth.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.199
And that's as modest as he gets.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.360
Pleasure to meet you.

21:10.361 --> 21:12.640
Laters!

21:15.920 --> 21:19.600
OK, the smoking, how did you know?

21:20.640 --> 21:23.079
The evidence was right under
your nose, John,

21:23.080 --> 21:24.800
as ever you see, but do not observe.

21:24.801 --> 21:26.959
Observe what? The ashtray.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.679
Kate?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.999
We're going to have a visitor.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.479
I'll need a bit of time
to get ready.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.159
A long time?

21:46.160 --> 21:49.240
.. Ages.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.599
What are you doing?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.919
I'm going to into battle, John.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.439
I need the right armour.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.719
No.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.879
Nah.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.319
Works for me.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.319
Everything works on you.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.119
So, what's the plan?

22:18.120 --> 22:20.119
We know her address.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.340
We just ring her doorbell?
Exactly. Just here, please.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.559
You didn't even
change your clothes.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.640
Then it's time to add
a splash of colour.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.199
Are we here?

22:35.200 --> 22:37.439
Two streets away, but this will do.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.719
For what? Punch me in the face.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.200
Shade?

22:42.360 --> 22:44.159
Blood.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.599
Punch you? Yes, punch me,
in the face. Didn't you hear me?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.959
I always hear "punch me" when you
speak but it's usually sub-text.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.920
For God's sakes!

22:58.640 --> 23:00.360
Thank you, that was...

23:03.760 --> 23:05.439
OK, I think we're done now, John!

23:05.440 --> 23:09.319
You want to remember, Sherlock,
I was a soldier. I killed people.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.600
You were a doctor!
I had bad days!

23:13.600 --> 23:15.519
What are you going to wear?

23:15.520 --> 23:18.119
My battle dress. Lucky boy.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.759
Hello?

23:27.760 --> 23:32.759
Very sorry to disturb you, um,
I've just been attacked, um,

23:32.760 --> 23:36.959
um, and I think they,
they took my wallet

23:36.960 --> 23:39.319
and, um, and my phone.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.399
Please could you help me?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.959
I can phone the police, if you want?

23:44.960 --> 23:47.280
Thank you. Could you, please?
Would you mind

23:47.281 --> 23:49.599
if I just waited here,
just until they come?

23:49.600 --> 23:51.439
Thank you, thank you so much.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.119
Thank you.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.319
I saw it all happen.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.100
It's OK, I'm a doctor.
Have you got a first aid kit?

24:01.101 --> 24:02.879
In the kitchen. Please.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.240
Thank you. Thank you.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.839
Hello,
sorry to hear you've been hurt.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.080
I don't think Kate caught your name?
I'm so sorry, I'm...

24:16.360 --> 24:20.600
It's always hard to remember an alias
when you've had a fright. Isn't it?

24:21.720 --> 24:23.679
Well, there now.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.400
We're both defrocked...

24:27.120 --> 24:28.559
Mr Sherlock Holmes.

24:28.560 --> 24:33.599
Miss Adler, I presume.
Look at those cheekbones.

24:33.600 --> 24:37.159
I could cut myself
slapping that face.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.040
Would you like me to try?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.840
Right, this should do it.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.600
I've missed something, haven't I?

24:51.040 --> 24:54.999
Please, sit down. Or if you'd like
some tea, I can call the maid.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I had some at the Palace.
I know. Clearly.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.200
I had a tea too, at the Palace.
If anyone's interested.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.199
Do you know the big problem
with a disguise, Mr Holmes?

25:33.200 --> 25:36.639
However hard you try,
it's always a self-portrait.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.599
You think I'm a vicar
with a bleeding face?

25:39.600 --> 25:41.719
No, I think you're damaged,
delusional

25:41.720 --> 25:44.880
and believe in a higher power.
In your case, it's yourself.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.279
And somebody loves you.

25:48.280 --> 25:52.440
If I had to punch that face,
I'd avoid your nose and teeth, too.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.879
Could you put something on, please?

25:55.880 --> 26:00.119
Anything at all. A napkin?
Why? Are you feeling exposed?

26:00.120 --> 26:02.679
I don't think John knows
where to look.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.480
No, I think he knows exactly where.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.679
I'm not sure about you.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.599
If I was to look at naked women,
I'd borrow John's laptop.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.799
You do borrow my laptop.
I confiscate it.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.720
Never mind, we've got better
things to talk about.

26:15.721 --> 26:17.639
Now, tell me, I need to know

26:17.640 --> 26:20.319
how was it done?

26:20.320 --> 26:21.959
What?

26:21.960 --> 26:26.079
The hiker with the bashed-in head...
how was he killed?

26:26.080 --> 26:29.039
That's not why I'm here.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.199
You're here for the photographs,

26:31.200 --> 26:33.480
but that's never going to happen
and as we're chatting...

26:33.481 --> 26:35.759
That story's not out.
How do you know about it?

26:35.760 --> 26:39.559
I know one of the policemen.
Well, I know what he likes.

26:39.560 --> 26:43.039
And you... like policemen?

26:43.040 --> 26:45.920
I like detective stories.
And detectives.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.079
Brainy is the new sexy.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.599
The position of the car
relative to the hiker,

26:51.600 --> 26:53.880
that and the fact that the
death blow was to the

26:53.881 --> 26:56.159
back of the head, that's
all you need to know.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.279
OK, tell me,
how was he murdered? He wasn't.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.959
You don't think it was murder?
I know it wasn't. How? The same way

27:02.960 --> 27:06.559
I know the victim was a sportsman,
recently returned from foreign travel

27:06.560 --> 27:10.479
and that the photographs I'm looking
for are in this room. OK, but how?

27:10.480 --> 27:12.400
So they are in this room. Thank you.

27:12.401 --> 27:14.920
John, man the door, let no-one in.

27:24.760 --> 27:29.839
Two men alone in the countryside,
several yards apart and one car.

27:29.840 --> 27:33.479
I, I thought you were looking
for the photos now. No, no.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.119
Looking takes ages,
I'm just going to find them,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.440
but you're clever and we've
got a moment, so let's

27:38.441 --> 27:40.759
pass the time.
Two men, a car, nobody else.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.239
Driver's trying to fix his engine.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.399
Getting nowhere.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.559
And the hiker is taking a moment,
looking at the sky.

27:49.560 --> 27:53.359
Watching the birds? Any moment now,
something is going to happen. What?

27:53.360 --> 27:55.760
The hiker is going to die.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.159
No, that's the result.
What's going to happen?

27:58.160 --> 28:01.839
I don't understand.
Well try to.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.559
Why? Because you cater
to the whims of the pathetic

28:04.560 --> 28:07.520
and take your clothes off
to make an impression.

28:07.521 --> 28:10.479
Stop boring me and think.
It's the new sexy.

28:10.480 --> 28:15.199
The car's going to backfire. There's
going to be a loud noise. So what?

28:15.200 --> 28:18.640
Noises are important. They can
tell you everything. For instance...

28:27.000 --> 28:28.599
Thank you.

28:28.600 --> 28:32.039
On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother
would look towards her child.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.840
Amazing how fire
exposes our priorities.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.359
I really hope you don't have
a baby in here.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.679
All right, John,
you can turn it off now.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.639
I said you can turn it off now!

28:47.640 --> 28:49.720
Give me a minute!

28:55.800 --> 28:57.039
Thank you.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.999
You should always use gloves
with these things, you know.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.599
Heaviest oil deposit is always
on the first key used,

29:04.600 --> 29:07.360
that's a 3, but after
that, the sequence is

29:07.361 --> 29:10.119
impossible to read.
I see it's a six digit code.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.440
It can't be your birthday,
no disrespect, but you

29:12.441 --> 29:14.759
were born in the '80s and
8's barely used, so...

29:14.760 --> 29:18.680
I'd tell you the code right now,
but you know what? I already have.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.440
Think.

29:22.400 --> 29:26.119
Hands behind your head,
on the floor, keep it still!

29:26.120 --> 29:29.039
Sorry, Sherlock.
Miss Adler, on the floor!

29:29.040 --> 29:33.519
Don't you want me on the floor, too?
No, sir, I want you to open the safe.

29:33.520 --> 29:37.479
American. Interesting.
Why would you care?

29:37.480 --> 29:40.160
Sir, the safe, now, please.
I don't know the code.

29:40.161 --> 29:42.839
We've been listening,
she said she told you.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.360
If you've been listening,
you'll know she didn't.

29:45.361 --> 29:47.879
I assume I missed something.
From your reputation,

29:47.880 --> 29:50.439
I assume you didn't, Mr Holmes.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.639
She's the one
who knows the code, ask her!

29:52.640 --> 29:55.160
Yes, sir, she also knows
the code that calls

29:55.161 --> 29:57.679
the police and sets off
the burglar alarm.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.879
I've learned not to trust her.
Mr Holmes doesn't... Shut up!

30:00.880 --> 30:02.519
One more word out of you,

30:02.520 --> 30:06.639
just one and I will decorate that
wall with the insides of your head.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.279
That, for me,
will not be a hardship.

30:09.280 --> 30:14.479
Mr Archer, at the count of three,
shoot Dr Watson. What?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.679
I don't know the code. One.

30:16.680 --> 30:20.999
I don't know the code. Two.
She didn't tell me, I don't know it!

30:21.000 --> 30:25.319
I'm prepared to believe you,
any second now.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.560
Three! No, stop!

30:48.200 --> 30:51.440
Thank you, Mr Holmes.
Open it, please.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.760
Vatican cameos!

31:15.400 --> 31:16.680
Do you mind? Not at all.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.919
He's dead. Thank you.
You were very observant. Observant?

31:26.920 --> 31:29.999
I'm flattered. Don't be. Flattered?

31:30.000 --> 31:33.680
There'll be more of them, they'll be
keeping an eye on the building.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.800
We should call the police. Yes.

31:44.280 --> 31:46.359
On their way. For God's sake!

31:46.360 --> 31:47.560
Shut up, it's quick.

31:47.561 --> 31:51.359
Check the rest of the house,
see how they got in.

31:51.360 --> 31:56.480
Well, that's the knighthood
in the bag. And that's mine.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.580
All the photographs are
on here, I presume?

32:01.581 --> 32:03.759
I have copies, of course.
No, you don't.

32:03.760 --> 32:08.239
You'll have permanently disabled
any kind of uplink or connection.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.639
Unless the contents of this phone
are unique, you couldn't sell them.

32:11.640 --> 32:15.319
Who said I'm selling?
Well, why would they be interested?

32:15.320 --> 32:18.220
Whatever's on the phone, it's
clearly not just photographs.

32:18.221 --> 32:21.119
That camera-phone is
my life, Mr Holmes.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.359
I'd die before I let you take it.
It's my protection.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.560
Sherlock! It was.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.840
Must have come in this way. Clearly.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.280
It's all right, she's just out cold.

32:48.281 --> 32:50.281
God knows she's used to that.

32:50.282 --> 32:52.280
There's a back door.
Better check it, Dr Watson.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.240
Sure.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.240
You're very calm.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.079
Well, your booby trap did just
kill a man. He would have killed me.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.800
It was self defence in advance.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.399
What is that?! What?

33:12.400 --> 33:14.439
Give it to me.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.559
Now. Give it to me.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.759
No.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.119
Give it to me. No.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.119
For goodness sake!

33:23.120 --> 33:24.799
Drop it.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.399
I... said... drop it!

33:28.400 --> 33:31.359
Thank you, dear.

33:31.360 --> 33:35.279
Now, tell that sweet little posh
thing the pictures are safe with me.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.239
They're not for blackmail,
just for insurance.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.319
Besides,
I might want to see her again.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.159
No no no no no.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.959
It's been a pleasure.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.919
Don't spoil it.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.599
This is how I want you
to remember me,

33:53.600 --> 33:57.080
the woman who beat you.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.719
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes.

34:01.720 --> 34:04.479
Jesus! What are you doing?
He'll sleep for a few hours.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.840
Make sure he doesn't choke
on his own vomit, it

34:06.841 --> 34:09.199
makes for a very unattractive corpse.
What's this?

34:09.199 --> 34:11.839
What have you given him?
Sherlock? He'll be fine.

34:11.840 --> 34:16.079
I've used it on loads of my friends.
Sherlock, can you hear me?

34:16.080 --> 34:18.480
You know, I was wrong about him.
He did know where to look.

34:18.481 --> 34:20.879
For what?
What are you talking about?

34:20.880 --> 34:24.518
The key-code to my safe.
What was it?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.320
Shall I tell him?

34:30.360 --> 34:32.359
My measurements.

34:45.639 --> 34:47.199
Got it!

34:47.199 --> 34:52.880
Ssh ssh no, don't get up,
I'll do the talking.

34:55.679 --> 35:02.079
So, the car's about to backfire and
the hiker, he's staring at the sky.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.359
You said he could be watching
birds, but he wasn't, was he?

35:05.360 --> 35:08.079
He was watching
another kind of flying thing.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.400
The car backfires
and the hiker turns to look...

35:13.960 --> 35:16.479
which was his big mistake.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.720
By the time the driver looks
up, the hiker is already dead.

35:18.721 --> 35:20.959
He doesn't see what killed him

35:20.960 --> 35:25.559
because it's already being
washed downstream.

35:25.560 --> 35:29.999
An accomplished sportsman recently
returned from foreign travel with...

35:30.000 --> 35:31.800
a boomerang.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.999
You got that from one look?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.320
Definitely the new sexy.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.360
I...

35:43.800 --> 35:45.760
I...

35:54.040 --> 35:55.879
Hush, now.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.600
It's OK.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.400
I'm only returning your coat.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.440
John?

36:10.760 --> 36:12.080
John!

36:16.960 --> 36:19.199
You OK? How did I get here?

36:19.200 --> 36:22.559
I don't suppose you remember much,
you weren't making a lot of sense.

36:22.560 --> 36:26.959
I should warn you, I think
Lestrade filmed you on his phone.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.119
Where is she? Where's who?
The woman, that woman. What woman?

36:30.120 --> 36:33.279
The Woman! The Woman, woman!
Irene Adler?

36:33.280 --> 36:36.480
She got away, no-one saw her.
She wasn't here, Sherlock.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.479
What are you?
What? No, no, no. No. Back to bed.

36:42.480 --> 36:46.039
You'll be fine in the morning.
Just sleep.

36:46.040 --> 36:49.279
Of course I'll be fine,
I am fine. I'm absolutely fine.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.439
Yes, you're great. Now,
I'll be next door if you need me.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.280
Why would I need you?
No reason at all.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.759
The photographs are perfectly safe.
In the hands of a fugitive sex worker?

37:40.760 --> 37:42.799
She's not interested in blackmail.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.879
She wants... protection,
for some reason.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.100
I take it you've stood
down the police

37:48.101 --> 37:50.319
investigation into the
shooting at her house?

37:50.320 --> 37:54.559
How can we do anything while she has
the photographs? Our hands are tied.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.919
She'd applaud your choice of words.

37:56.920 --> 38:00.439
You see how this works? The camera-phone
is her get out of jail free card.

38:00.440 --> 38:03.439
You have to leave her alone.
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.839
Though not the way she treats
royalty.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.999
What was that?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.840
Text.
But what was that noise?

38:13.520 --> 38:16.319
Did you know there were
other people after her too

38:16.320 --> 38:18.319
before you sent John and I in there?

38:18.320 --> 38:20.999
CIA trained killers, I think.
Thanks for that.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.679
It's a disgrace, sending your little
brother into danger like that.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.319
Family is all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

38:28.320 --> 38:30.560
Shut up, Mrs Hudson!
Mycroft!!

38:36.960 --> 38:40.439
Apologies. Thank you.
Though do in fact shut up.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.239
It's a bit rude,
that noise, isn't it?

38:45.240 --> 38:49.279
There's nothing you can do and nothing
she will do, as far as I can see.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.599
I can put maximum
surveillance on her.

38:52.600 --> 38:57.599
Why bother?
You can follow her on Twitter.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.559
I believe her user name is
The Whip Hand.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.000
Most amusing. Excuse me. Hello?

39:09.040 --> 39:13.439
Why does your phone make that noise?

39:13.440 --> 39:16.119
What noise?
That noise, the one it just made.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.119
It's a text alert,
means I've got a text.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.479
Your texts don't usually
make that noise.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.919
Well, somebody got hold of the phone
and apparently as a joke,

39:24.920 --> 39:27.239
personalised their text alert noise.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.960
So every time they text you...

39:30.920 --> 39:33.159
It would seem so.

39:33.160 --> 39:38.319
Could you turn that phone down a
bit? At my time of life it's...

39:41.480 --> 39:44.679
See I'm wondering who could have
got hold of your phone.

39:44.680 --> 39:48.080
It would've been in your coat.
I'll leave you to your deductions.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.079
I'm not stupid, you know.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.999
Where do you get that idea?

39:54.000 --> 39:57.039
Bond Air is go, that's decided.
Check with the Coventry lot.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.279
Talk later.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.159
What else does she have?

40:02.160 --> 40:05.639
Irene Adler. The Americans
wouldn't be interested in her

40:05.640 --> 40:08.319
for a couple of
compromising photographs.

40:08.320 --> 40:11.999
There's more. Much more.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.399
Something big's coming, isn't it?

40:15.400 --> 40:19.719
Irene Adler is no longer
any concern of yours.

40:19.720 --> 40:23.559
From now on,
you will stay out of this.

40:23.560 --> 40:26.879
Will I? Yes, Sherlock.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.400
You will.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.239
Now if you'll excuse me,

40:33.240 --> 40:36.959
I have a long and arduous apology
to make to a very old friend.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.519
Do give her my love.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.479
Lovely, Sherlock. That was lovely.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.799
Marvellous. Yes, very good.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.760
I wish you could have worn
the antlers.

41:17.761 --> 41:21.239
Some things are best left to the
imagination, Mrs Hudson. Mrs H?

41:21.240 --> 41:24.439
No thank you, Sarah. No, no,
he's not good with names.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.640
No, I can get this.

41:25.641 --> 41:28.559
Sarah was the doctor, then there was
the one with the spots,

41:28.560 --> 41:32.999
then the one with the nose and then,
who was after the boring teacher?

41:33.000 --> 41:37.199
Nobody. Jeanette! Process
of elimination. Dear Lord.

41:37.200 --> 41:41.199
Hello, everyone.
It said on the door to come up.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.239
Hello, Molly. Hello, Molly!

41:43.240 --> 41:46.839
Everybody saying hello to each
other, how wonderful!

41:46.840 --> 41:49.279
Let me, er... Holy Mary!

41:49.280 --> 41:52.879
So we're having Christmas drinkies?
No stopping them, apparently.

41:52.880 --> 41:56.799
It's the one day of the year where
the boys have to be nice to me,

41:56.800 --> 41:58.919
so it's almost worth it.

41:58.920 --> 42:01.460
John? The counter on
your blog still says 1895.

42:01.461 --> 42:03.999
No, Christmas is cancelled

42:04.000 --> 42:08.319
And you've got a photograph of me
wearing that hat! People like it.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.799
No, they don't. What people?
How's the hip?

42:10.800 --> 42:13.079
It's atrocious,
but thanks for asking.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.919
I've seen much worse,
but then I do post-mortems.

42:15.920 --> 42:20.199
God, sorry.
Don't make jokes, Molly.

42:20.200 --> 42:23.439
No, sorry. Here you are. Thank you.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.319
I thought you were in Dorset
for Christmas?

42:26.320 --> 42:29.719
First thing in the morning, me and
the wife, back together, sorted.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.639
No, she's sleeping with a PE
teacher.

42:32.640 --> 42:36.039
And John, I hear you're off
to your sister's? Yeah.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.279
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.159
First time ever, she's cleaned up
her act, off the booze.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.599
Nope. Shut up, Sherlock!

42:42.600 --> 42:46.719
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly.
You're serious about him. Sorry, what?

42:46.720 --> 42:49.679
You're seeing him tonight, giving
him a gift. Take a day off.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.620
Shut up. Have a drink.
Surely you see the

42:51.621 --> 42:53.559
perfectly wrapped
present in the bag.

42:53.560 --> 42:56.279
The others are slapdash.
It's for someone special.

42:56.280 --> 43:00.439
The shade of red echoes her lipstick
... an unconscious association,

43:00.440 --> 43:02.740
or one she's deliberately
trying to encourage.

43:02.741 --> 43:05.039
Either way, Miss Hooper
has love on her mind.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.839
That she's serious about him is clear
from the fact she's giving him a gift.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.119
It suggests long-term hopes.

43:11.120 --> 43:14.519
That she's seeing him tonight is
evident from her make-up and clothes.

43:14.520 --> 43:18.680
Obviously trying to compensate for
the size of her mouth and breasts.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.639
You always say such horrible things.

43:28.640 --> 43:32.559
Every time. Always.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.080
Always.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.360
I am sorry. Forgive me.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.519
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.799
No!
That wasn't, I didn't...

43:52.800 --> 43:55.359
No, it was me. My God, really?

43:55.360 --> 43:56.959
What? My phone.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.759
Fifty seven? Sorry, what?

43:59.760 --> 44:02.719
Fifty seven of those texts,
the ones I've heard.

44:02.720 --> 44:05.680
Thrilling that you've been counting.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.319
Excuse me.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.999
What's up, Sherlock?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I said excuse me.
Do you ever reply?

44:48.560 --> 44:52.519
Dear Lord, we're not going to have
Christmas phone calls now, are we?

44:52.520 --> 44:54.719
Have they passed a new law?

44:54.720 --> 44:57.559
I think you're going to find
Irene Adler tonight.

44:57.560 --> 44:59.519
We already know where she is.

44:59.520 --> 45:03.239
As you were kind enough to point
out, it hardly matters.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.480
No, I mean you're going
to find her dead.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.840
You OK? Yes.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.399
The only one who fitted
the description.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.519
Had her brought here,
your home from home.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.439
You didn't need to come in, Molly.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.759
It's OK, everyone else
is busy with... Christmas.

45:37.760 --> 45:42.840
The face is a bit sort of bashed-up,
so it might be a bit difficult.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.960
That's her, isn't it?
Show me the rest of her.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.319
That's her.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.359
Thank you, Miss Hooper.

45:58.360 --> 46:03.200
Who is she? How did Sherlock
recognise her from... not her face?

46:22.040 --> 46:26.800
Just the one. Why?
Merry Christmas.

46:31.240 --> 46:35.600
Smoking indoors, isn't there one
of those... one of those law things?

46:37.800 --> 46:39.399
We're in a morgue.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.480
There's only
so much damage you can do.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.679
How did you know she was dead?

46:45.680 --> 46:51.319
She had an item in her possession,
one she said her life depended on.

46:51.320 --> 46:56.120
She chose to give it up.
Where is this item now?

46:59.640 --> 47:01.799
Look at them.

47:01.800 --> 47:05.320
They all care so much.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.759
Do you ever wonder
if there's something wrong with us?

47:11.760 --> 47:16.639
All lives end,
all hearts are broken.

47:16.640 --> 47:22.200
Caring is not an advantage,
Sherlock.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.879
This is low tar.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.199
Well, you barely knew her.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.560
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.680
And a happy new year.

47:52.840 --> 47:55.279
He's on his way.
Have you found anything?

47:55.280 --> 47:57.799
No. Did he take the cigarette?
Yes. Shit!

47:57.800 --> 48:01.039
He's coming, ten minutes.
There's nothing in the bedroom.

48:01.040 --> 48:04.679
It looks like he's clean,
we've tried all the usual places.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.999
Are you sure tonight's
a danger night?

48:07.000 --> 48:10.639
No, but then I never am.
You have to stay with him, John.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.319
I've got plans.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.640
No.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.040
Mycroft?

48:25.960 --> 48:28.079
I am really sorry.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.519
You know my friends are
so wrong about you?

48:30.520 --> 48:34.639
You're a great boyfriend.
OK, that's good.

48:34.640 --> 48:38.839
I always thought I was great.
Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.479
Jeanette, please.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.999
No, I mean it. It's heart-warming.
You'll do anything for him.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.679
And he can't even tell
your girlfriends apart!

48:46.680 --> 48:49.759
I'll do anything for you, just tell
me what it is I'm not doing.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.399
Don't make me compete
with Sherlock Holmes!

48:52.400 --> 48:55.759
I'll walk your dog. There, I've said
it, I'll even walk your dog.

48:55.760 --> 48:59.959
I don't have a dog!
No, because that was the last one.

48:59.960 --> 49:04.879
OK. Jesus! I'll call you. No! OK.

49:04.880 --> 49:07.400
That really wasn't very good,
was it?

49:20.080 --> 49:21.720
Hi.

49:24.520 --> 49:25.560
You OK?

49:31.840 --> 49:34.760
I hope you didn't mess up
my sock index this time!

50:01.160 --> 50:04.959
Lovely tune, Sherlock,
haven't heard that one before.

50:04.960 --> 50:08.519
Composing?

50:08.520 --> 50:09.760
Helps me to think.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.519
What are you thinking about?

50:19.520 --> 50:23.559
The count on your blog
is still stuck at 1895.

50:23.560 --> 50:26.799
Yes.
Faulty, can't seem to fix it.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.559
Faulty, or you've been hacked
and it's a message.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.239
Just faulty.

50:40.240 --> 50:43.000
Right.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.319
Right.

50:46.320 --> 50:50.560
Well, I'm going out for a bit.

50:59.160 --> 51:03.359
Listen, has he ever had any
kind of girlfriend,

51:03.360 --> 51:07.479
boyfriend, a relationship, ever?

51:07.480 --> 51:09.119
I don't know.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.479
How can we not know?

51:10.480 --> 51:11.799
He's Sherlock.

51:11.800 --> 51:15.359
How will we ever know what goes
on in that funny old head?

51:15.360 --> 51:18.200
Right. See you.

51:32.160 --> 51:34.240
John? Yeah? Hello?

51:37.600 --> 51:40.439
Hello.
So, any plans for new year tonight?

51:40.440 --> 51:44.840
Nothing fixed.

51:46.960 --> 51:50.439
Nothing I couldn't
heartlessly abandon.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.720
You have any ideas? One.

51:57.120 --> 51:59.199
You know,
Mycroft could just phone me,

51:59.200 --> 52:02.680
if he didn't have this
bloody stupid power complex.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.719
Couldn't we just go to a cafe?

52:32.720 --> 52:34.840
Sherlock doesn't
follow me everywhere.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.480
Through there.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.919
He's on his way.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.800
You were right,
he thinks it's Mycroft.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.240
He's writing sad music.

53:00.080 --> 53:03.439
Doesn't eat, barely talks,

53:03.440 --> 53:08.639
only to correct the television.

53:08.640 --> 53:12.639
I'd say he was heart-broken,
but, well he's Sherlock.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.880
He does all that anyway.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.360
Hello, Dr Watson.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.480
Tell him you're alive.

53:30.481 --> 53:32.279
He'd come after me.

53:32.280 --> 53:36.079
I'll come after you if you don't.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.919
I believe you.

53:37.920 --> 53:41.159
You were dead on a slab.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.959
It was definitely you.

53:42.960 --> 53:45.959
DNA tests are only as good
as the records you keep.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.799
And I bet you know the record keeper.
I know what he likes.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.719
And I needed to disappear.

53:50.720 --> 53:54.639
Then how come I can see you
and I don't even want to?

53:54.640 --> 53:56.079
Look, I made a mistake,

53:56.080 --> 54:00.519
I sent something to Sherlock for
safekeeping, now I need it back.

54:00.520 --> 54:03.039
I need your help. No.
It's for his own safety.

54:03.040 --> 54:06.399
So is this.
Tell him you're alive.

54:06.400 --> 54:10.559
I can't. Fine, I'll tell him

54:10.560 --> 54:15.439
and I still won't help you.
What do I say?

54:15.440 --> 54:19.359
What do you normally say?!
You've texted him a lot!

54:19.360 --> 54:23.639
Just the usual stuff.
There is no usual in this case.

54:23.640 --> 54:27.679
"Good morning.
I like your funny hat.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.600
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner.

54:29.601 --> 54:33.439
" You look sexy on Crimewatch,
let's have dinner.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.599
"I'm not hungry.

54:35.600 --> 54:39.479
"Let's have dinner".

54:39.480 --> 54:43.319
You flirted with Sherlock Holmes?
At him. He never replies.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.679
No, Sherlock always replies
to everything.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.799
He's Mr Punchline.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.519
He will outlive God trying
to have the last word.

54:50.520 --> 54:52.639
Does that make me special?

54:52.640 --> 54:56.599
I don't know, maybe.
Are you jealous?

54:56.600 --> 55:00.319
We're not a couple.
Yes, you are.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.879
There, "I'm not dead."

55:03.880 --> 55:07.119
"Let's have dinner".

55:07.120 --> 55:11.279
Who the hell knows about
Sherlock Holmes? But for the record,

55:11.280 --> 55:15.039
if anyone out there still cares,
I'm not actually gay.

55:15.040 --> 55:19.840
Well, I am. Look at us both.

55:34.240 --> 55:38.120
I don't think so, do you?

56:41.440 --> 56:43.560
Stop it! Stop it!

56:45.280 --> 56:47.800
Sherlock!

57:06.000 --> 57:09.799
Sherlock, Sherlock...
Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson,

57:09.800 --> 57:12.960
it'll do nothing to impede
the flight of a bullet.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.479
What a tender world that would be.

57:16.480 --> 57:18.039
Please, Sherlock...

57:18.040 --> 57:21.399
I believe that you have
something that we want, Mr Holmes.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.480
Then why don't you ask for it?

57:27.440 --> 57:31.759
I've been asking this one,
she doesn't seem to know anything.

57:31.760 --> 57:35.640
But you know what I'm asking for,
don't you, Mr Holmes?

57:43.520 --> 57:46.000
I believe I do.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.960
Please, help.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.599
First get rid of your boys.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.519
Why? I dislike being outnumbered,

57:54.520 --> 57:56.840
it makes for too much
stupid in the room.

57:58.120 --> 58:01.479
You two, go to the car.
Then get into the car and drive away.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.880
Don't try to trick me,
you know who I am, it doesn't work.

58:10.040 --> 58:12.959
Next, you can stop pointing
that gun at me.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.799
So you can point a gun at me?

58:14.800 --> 58:15.919
I'm unarmed.

58:15.920 --> 58:18.280
Mind if I check? I insist.

58:30.560 --> 58:33.200
Moron.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.000
Thank you. You're all right now,
you're all right.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.720
Jeez, what the
hell is happening?

59:08.721 --> 59:10.679
Mrs Hudson has been
attacked by an American,

59:10.680 --> 59:12.839
I'm restoring balance
to the universe.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.399
Mrs Hudson, my God,
are you all right?

59:15.400 --> 59:17.479
Jesus, what have they done to you?

59:17.480 --> 59:19.239
I'm just being so silly.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.879
Take her downstairs
and look after her.

59:21.880 --> 59:26.239
It's all right,
I'll have a look at that.

59:26.240 --> 59:27.560
I'm fine, I'm fine.

59:28.720 --> 59:31.800
Are you going to tell me
what's going on? I expect so, now go.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.599
Lestrade?

59:36.600 --> 59:39.439
We've had a break-in
at Baker Street.

59:39.440 --> 59:42.879
Send your least irritating officers
and an ambulance.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.999
No, no, no, we're fine.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.320
No, it's the burglar, he's
got himself rather badly injured.

59:50.600 --> 59:55.000
A few broken ribs, fractured
skull, suspected punctured lung...

59:56.960 --> 59:58.520
He fell out of a window.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.760
It stings.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.359
That was right on my bins.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:18.079
And exactly how many times
did he fall out the window?

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.479
It's all a bit of a blur,
Detective Inspector.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.200
I lost count.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.679
She'll have to sleep
upstairs in our flat tonight,

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.080
we need to look after her.

01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:35.679
No... She's fine.
No, she's not, look at her.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.319
She's got to take some time
away from Baker Street.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.039
She can stay with her sister,
doctor's orders.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.479
Don't be absurd.
She's in shock, for God's sake,

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.599
and all over some stupid
camera-phone... where is it anyway?

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.919
Safest place I know.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.039
You left it in the pocket of your
second best dressing gown, you clot!

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.919
I managed to sneak it out when
they thought I was having a cry.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.639
Thank you.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.439
Shame on you, John Watson.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.599
Shame on me?
Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.440
England would fall.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.119
Where is it now?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.479
Where no-one will look.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.559
Whatever's on that phone
is more than just pictures.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.200
Yes, it is.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.840
So, she's alive then.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.520
How are we feeling about that?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.999
Happy New Year, John.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.960
Do you think you'll be
seeing her again?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.999
Is that a phone?
It's a camera-phone.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.839
And you're x-raying it?
Yes, I am.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.599
Whose phone is it? A woman's.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.039
Your girlfriend?

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.479
She's my girlfriend because
I'm x-raying her possessions?

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.600
Well, we all do silly things! Yes...

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.199
they do, don't they?

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.320
Very silly.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.519
She sent this to my address.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.920
She loves to play games. She does?

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.839
Hey, Sherlock...

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.519
We have a client.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.360
What, in your bedroom?

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.919
So, who's after you?

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.999
People who want to kill me.
Who's that?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.919
Killers.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.320
It would help if you were
a tiny bit more specific.

01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:07.100
So you faked your own death
to get ahead of them?

01:04:07.101 --> 01:04:08.879
It worked for a while.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.000
Except you let John know
you're alive, therefore me.

01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:13.119
I knew you'd keep my secret.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.519
You couldn't.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.160
But you did, didn't you?

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.119
Where's my camera-phone?

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.519
It's not here.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.959
We're not stupid.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.820
What have you done with it?

01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:25.679
If they've guessed,
they'll be watching you.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.999
Then they'll know I took
a safety deposit box

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.079
at a bank on the Strand
a few months ago.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.159
I need it.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.520
Well, we can't just go
and get it, can we?

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.919
Molly Hooper, she could collect it,
take it to Barts.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.119
Then one of your homeless network could
bring it here, leave it in the cafe,

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.679
one of the boys downstairs
could bring it up the back.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.239
Very good, John, excellent plan,
full of intelligent precautions.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.120
Thank you.
So, why don't I phone...

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.759
So, what do you keep on here?

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.559
In general, I mean?

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.679
Pictures, information,
anything I might find useful.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.960
For blackmail? For protection.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.039
I make my way in the world,
I misbehave.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.439
I like to know people will be on my
side exactly when I need them to be.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.399
So how do you acquire this information?
I told you I misbehave.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.840
But you've acquired something
more danger than protection.

01:05:18.841 --> 01:05:21.279
Do you know what it is? Yes...

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.919
but I don't understand it.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.640
I assumed. Show me.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.160
The passcode.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.759
It's not working.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.199
No, because it's
a duplicate I had made

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.639
into which you just
entered the numbers 1058.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.800
I assumed you'd choose something more
specific than that, but thanks, anyway.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.199
I told you that
camera-phone was my life.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.879
I know when it's in my hand.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.239
You're rather good.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.240
You're not so bad.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.480
Hamish.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.760
John Hamish Watson, just
if you were looking for baby names.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:28.640
There was a man, an MOD official
and I knew what he liked.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.399
One of the things
he liked was showing off.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.919
He told me this email was going
to save the world.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.799
He didn't know but I photographed it
... he was a bit tied up at the time.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.919
It's a bit small on that screen,
can you read it?

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.199
Yes. Code, obviously.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.359
I had one of the country's
best cryptographers take a look,

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.159
though he was mostly upside down,
as I recall.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.320
Couldn't figure it out.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.720
What can you do, Mr Holmes?

01:06:55.721 --> 01:06:58.920
Go on, impress a girl.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.639
There's a margin for error,

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.700
but I'm pretty sure
there's a 747 leaving

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.759
Heathrow tomorrow at
6.30 for Baltimore.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.559
Apparently it's going to
save the world, I'm not sure how,

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.960
but give me a moment, I've only
been on the case eight seconds.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.439
Come on, it's not code,
these are seats on a jet.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.759
Look, no 'I' because
it can be mistaken for one.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.519
No letters past 'K'
the width of the plane is the limit.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.799
The numbers always appear
not in sequence,

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.900
but the letters have
little runs of sequence

01:07:40.901 --> 01:07:42.999
families and couples
sitting together.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.180
Only a Jumbo's wide enough
for a letter 'K' or

01:07:45.181 --> 01:07:47.359
rows past 55, so there's
always an upstairs.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.639
A row 13 eliminates
superstitious airlines.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.879
The style of the flight number,
'007', eliminates a few more.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.719
Assuming a British point of origin
because of the original source,

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.959
and assuming the crisis is imminent,
the only flight that matches

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.500
all the criteria and
departs within the week is

01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:05.040
the 6.30 to Baltimore
tomorrow from Heathrow.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.119
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was amazing,

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.719
John's expressed that in every
possible variant available in English.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.198
I would have you right here,
on this desk,

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.399
until you begged for mercy twice.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.160
John, can you check those
flight schedules, see if I'm right?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.078
I'm on it, yeah.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.279
I've never begged for mercy
in my life.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:32.919
Twice.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.118
Yeah, you're right,
flight double 'o' seven.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.519
What did you say? You're right.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.559
No, what did you say after that?

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.279
Double 'o' seven,
flight double 'o' seven.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.240
Double 'o' seven,
double 'o' seven...

01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:47.078
Something, double 'o' seven...

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.640
What?

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.038
Double 'o' seven,
double 'o' seven, what?

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.680
What, something, what?!

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.519
Bond Air is go.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.920
Bond Air is go.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.800
Bond Air is go.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.199
'Bond Air is go, that's decided.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.320
'Check with the Coventry lot.'

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.160
Coventry. I've never been.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.719
Is it nice?

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.479
Where's John?

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.799
He went out, a couple of hours ago.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.839
I was just talking to him.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.519
He said you do that.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.240
What's Coventry got to do
with anything?

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.879
It's a story, probably not true

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.220
in the Second World
War, the Allies knew

01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:57.559
Coventry was going to
get bombed, because

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.159
they'd broken the German code, but
didn't want the Germans to know that,

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.800
so they let it happen anyway.
Have you ever had anyone?

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.199
I'm sorry?

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.039
And when I say had,
I'm being indelicate.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.520
I don't understand.
I'll be delicate then.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.839
Let's have dinner. Why?

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.359
You might be hungry.
I'm not. Good.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:29.199
Why would I... want to have dinner...

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.199
if I wasn't hungry?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.239
Mr Holmes,
if it was the end of the world,

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.560
if this was the very last night...

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.439
would you have dinner with me?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.799
Sherlock?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.879
Too late.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.479
That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs Hudson.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.399
Sherlock, this man was at the door,
is the bell still not working?

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.759
He shot it.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.919
Have you come to take me away again?

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.759
Yes, Mr Holmes. Well, I decline.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.160
I don't think you do.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.879
There's going to be a bomb
on a passenger jet.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.319
The British and Americans
know about it,

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.040
but rather than expose
their source they're going

01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:40.759
to let it happen
the plane will blow up.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.359
Coventry all over again.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.440
The wheel turns,
nothing is ever new.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.439
Well, you're looking all better.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.279
How you feeling?

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.679
Like putting a bullet in your brain,
sir.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.719
They'd pin a medal on me if I did...

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.080
sir.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.279
The Coventry conundrum.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.560
What do you think of my solution?

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.800
The flight of the dead.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.279
Plane blows up midair, mission
accomplished for the terrorists,

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.879
hundreds of casualties,
but nobody dies.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.079
Neat, don't you think?

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.879
You've been stumbling around
the fringes of this one for ages.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.639
Or were you too bored
to notice the pattern?

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.439
They wouldn't let us see Granddad
when he was dead.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.359
She's not my real aunt
I know human ash.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.919
We ran a similar project with
the Germans a while back,

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.560
though I believe one of our
passengers didn't make the flight.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.079
But that's the deceased for you...

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.439
late, in every sense of the word.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.079
How is the plane going to fly?

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.119
Of course, unmanned aircraft,
hardly new.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.839
It doesn't fly.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.439
It will never fly.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.599
This entire project is cancelled.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.799
The terrorist cells have been
informed we know about the bomb.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.520
We can't fool them now.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.039
We've lost everything.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.759
One fragment of one email,

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.160
and months and years of planning
finished.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.639
Your MOD man.
That's all it takes.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.879
One lonely, naive man,
desperate to show off,

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.560
and a woman clever enough
to make him feel special.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.919
You should screen your
defence people more carefully.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.080
I'm not talking about the MOD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.480
The damsel in distress.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.079
In the end,
are you really so obvious?

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.960
Because this was textbook.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.760
The promise of love, the pain
of loss, the joy of redemption.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.680
Then give him a puzzle
and watch him dance.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.559
Don't be absurd!

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.999
Absurd?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.679
How quickly did you decipher
that email for her?

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.399
Was it the full minute?

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.199
Or were you really eager to impress?

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.720
I think it was less than
five seconds.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.640
I drove you into her path.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.199
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.479
Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.639
So do I, there are a number of
aspects I'm still not clear on.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.400
Not you, Junior, you're done now.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.879
There's more, loads more.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.519
On this phone I've got secrets,
pictures

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.399
and scandals that could
topple your whole world.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.879
You have no idea how much havoc I can
cause and exactly one way to stop me.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.959
Unless you want to tell
your masters

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.240
that your biggest security leak
is your own little brother.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.879
We have people
who can get into this.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.719
I tested that theory for you.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.479
I let Sherlock Holmes
try it for six months.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.039
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you
found when you x-rayed my phone.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.879
Four additional units
wired inside the casing,

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.799
I suspect containing acid
or a small explosive.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.399
Any attempt to open it
will burn the hard drive.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.519
Explosive.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.519
It's more me.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.079
Some data is always recoverable.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.360
Take that risk.

01:17:39.361 --> 01:17:41.319
You have a passcode to open this.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.159
I deeply regret to say, we have
people who can extract it from you.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.279
Sherlock? There will be
two passcodes

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.479
one to open the phone,
one to burn the drive.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.359
Even under duress, you can't know
which one she's given

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.519
and there would be no second
attempt. He's good, isn't he?

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.199
I should have him on a leash.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.399
In fact, I might.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.039
We destroy this, then.
No-one has the information.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.559
Fine, good idea.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.319
Unless there are lives
of British citizens

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.519
depending on the information
you burn.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.439
Are there?
Telling you would be playing fair.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.640
I'm not playing any more.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.679
A list of my requests,

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.560
and some ideas about my protection
once they're granted.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.680
I'd say it wouldn't blow
much of a hole in the

01:18:29.681 --> 01:18:32.080
wealth of a nation, but
then I'd be lying.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.079
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it.
Thank you, yes.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.480
Too bad.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.880
Off you pop and talk to people.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.320
You've been very... thorough.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.279
I wish our lot were
half as good as you.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.160
I can't take all the credit,
I had a bit of help.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.799
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.559
Yes, he's been in touch.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.199
Seems desperate for my attention,

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.479
which I'm sure can be arranged.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.839
I had all this stuff and
never knew what to do with it.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.959
Thank God for
the consultant criminal.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.839
Gave me a lot of advice about how
to play the Holmes boys.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.839
Do you know what he calls you?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.079
The Ice Man...

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.520
and the Virgin.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.119
Didn't even ask for anything,
he just likes to cause trouble

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.519
that's my kind of man.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.359
And here you are,

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.559
the dominatrix who brought
a nation to its knees.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.679
Nicely played.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.240
No.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.720
Sorry?

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.519
I said no.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.039
Very, very close, but no.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.879
You got carried away.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.559
The game was too elaborate,
you were enjoying yourself too much.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.399
There's no such thing as too much.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.799
Enjoying the thrill
of the chase is fine.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.079
Craving the distraction of the game,
I sympathise, but sentiment?

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.799
Sentiment is a chemical defect
found in the losing side.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.559
Sentiment?
What are you talking about?

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.040
You.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.799
Dear God.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.200
Look at the poor man.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.279
You don't actually think
I was interested in you?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.999
Why?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.359
Because you're the great
Sherlock Holmes,

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.559
the clever detective
in the funny hat?

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.000
No.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.680
Because I took your pulse.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.239
Elevated.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.160
Your pupils dilated.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.039
I imagine John Watson thinks
love's a mystery to me,

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.919
but the chemistry is incredibly
simple and very destructive.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.240
When we first met, you
told me that disguise

01:21:05.241 --> 01:21:07.559
is always a self-portrait
- How true of you.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.998
The combination to your safe,
your measurements

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:11.960
but this,
this is far more intimate,

01:21:11.961 --> 01:21:15.879
this is your heart and you should
never let it rule your head.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.319
You could have chosen any number
and walked out with everything.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.079
But you just couldn't resist it,
could you?

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:27.039
I've always assumed that love
is a dangerous disadvantage.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.000
Thank you for the final proof.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.840
Everything I said, it's not real.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.479
I was just playing the game.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.079
I know.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.040
And this is just losing.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.039
There you are, Brother,

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.399
hope the contents make up for any
inconvenience caused tonight.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.519
I'm certain they will.
If you're feeling kind, lock her up,

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.839
let her go and I doubt
she'll survive long.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.600
Are you expecting me to beg?
Yes.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.640
Please.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.520
You're right.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.760
I won't even last six months.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.240
Sorry about dinner.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.639
You don't smoke.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.360
I also don't frequent cafes.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.719
This the file on Irene Adler?

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.639
Closed forever.

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.239
I am about to go
and inform my brother

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.159
or, if you prefer, you are

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.399
that she somehow got herself into a
witness protection scheme in America.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.239
New name, new identity.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:20.119
She will survive and thrive...

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.039
but he will never see her again.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.399
Why would he care?

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.799
He despised her at the end.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.839
Won't even mention her by name,
just 'The Woman'.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.400
Is that loathing or a salute?

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:36.039
One of a kind,
the one woman who matters.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.399
He's not like that.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.159
He doesn't feel things that way,
I don't think.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.799
My brother has the brain
of a scientist or a philosopher,

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.840
yet he elects to be a detective.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.279
What might we deduce
about his heart?

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.639
I don't know.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.879
Neither do I.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.920
But, initially,
he wanted to be a pirate.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.520
He'll be OK with this

01:24:01.521 --> 01:24:03.160
witness protection, never
seeing her again

01:24:03.161 --> 01:24:04.799
he'll be fine.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.079
I agree.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.440
That's why I decided
to tell him that.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.320
Instead of what?

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.960
She's dead.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.559
She was captured by a terrorist
cell in Karachi two months ago

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.040
and beheaded.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.039
It was definitely her?

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.599
She's done this before.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.680
I was thorough this time.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.879
It would take
Sherlock Holmes to fool me,

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.120
and I don't think
he was on hand, do you?

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.000
So...

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.120
What shall we tell Sherlock?

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.039
Clearly you've got news.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.519
If it's about the Leeds triple
murder, it was the gardener.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.039
Did nobody notice the earring? Hi.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:11.960
No, it's, um... it's about
Irene Adler.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.479
Well?

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.799
Something happened?
Has she come back?

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.319
No, she's... I bumped into Mycroft
downstairs, he had to take a call.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.079
Is she back in London?

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.319
No...

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.840
She's...

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.399
She's in America.
America?

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.799
Got herself on a witness protection
scheme, apparently.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.679
Don't know how she swung it,
but... well, you know.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.039
I know what? You won't be able
to see her again.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.839
Why would I want to see her again?
Didn't say you did.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.999
Is that her file? Yes, I was going
to take it back to Mycroft.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.560
Do you want to... No.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.919
Listen, actually...

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.080
But I will have
the camera-phone though.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.919
There's nothing on it, it's been
stripped... I know, but I...

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.439
I'll still have it.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.600
I've got to give this back to
Mycroft, you can't keep it.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:20.079
Sherlock, I have to give this to
Mycroft, it's the government's now...

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.000
Please.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.400
Thank you.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.560
Well, I'd better take this back.
Yes.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.639
Did she ever text you again,
after all that?

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.159
Once, a few months ago.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.439
What did she say?

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.200
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes."

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.159
When I say run...

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.680
run!

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040
The Woman.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.880
THE Woman.
