00:03.852 --> 00:06.401
I'm not okay with never
seeing you ever again.

00:06.403 --> 00:08.370
- PETER: Don't walk away from your family.
- You know what?

00:08.372 --> 00:10.372
Growing up, out of all my
friends, I was the only one

00:10.374 --> 00:12.441
whose family didn't have
a legacy in Mystic Falls.

00:12.443 --> 00:14.276
That could've changed everything for me.

DORIAN: <i>The Maxwell heirloom and
the tuning fork, those things</i>

00:17.106 --> 00:19.614
fit together to make the hammer
that swings inside a bell.

<i>When properly assembled, this
bell becomes, like, a mystical</i>

00:22.853 --> 00:24.786
- super-bell.
- You let them go.

00:24.788 --> 00:27.122
You knew all along I'd have
to kill people for Cade.

00:27.124 --> 00:30.092
Evil people and murderers.
These girls are innocent.

00:30.094 --> 00:31.293
- Exactly.

No!

CAROLINE: One day,
you're going to realize

00:34.698 --> 00:37.032
that you don't even
remember what happiness is.

00:37.034 --> 00:40.068
Until then, just stay away from me.

00:40.070 --> 00:41.770
Your humanity is gonna flood back.

00:41.772 --> 00:44.506
You'll be consumed with
guilt for kidnapping

00:44.508 --> 00:46.074
<i>Ric and Caroline's children,</i>

00:46.076 --> 00:48.643
<i>for selling your brother's soul to Cade,</i>

00:48.645 --> 00:50.220
for killing Tyler Lockwood.

SYBIL: <i>I'm not the
thing inside your head</i>

(beep)

01:10.310 --> 01:12.143
Good morning.

01:12.145 --> 01:13.653
That was thoroughly unconvincing.

01:13.678 --> 01:14.545
What are you up to?

01:14.547 --> 01:15.546
Oh, you know,

01:15.548 --> 01:18.049
just... (sighs) motivating.

01:18.051 --> 01:19.450
Translation:

01:19.452 --> 01:22.020
you are still in bed,
moping about Stefan.

01:22.022 --> 01:23.388
Guilty as charged.

01:23.390 --> 01:25.495
Why are you breathing so heavy?

01:25.520 --> 01:26.658
I'm jogging.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.427
I needed to get out, clear my head.

01:29.429 --> 01:30.662
What's on your mind?

01:30.664 --> 01:31.829
Enzo.

01:31.831 --> 01:32.873
I need your advice.

01:32.898 --> 01:34.115
You want to grab breakfast?

01:34.140 --> 01:35.760
I'm the last person you should be asking

01:35.785 --> 01:37.168
for relationship advice.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.504
My fiancé turned Miss
Mystic Falls into a vampire

01:39.506 --> 01:40.938
just to spite me.

01:40.940 --> 01:44.275
So, no, I am not going anywhere.

01:44.277 --> 01:46.077
(sighs) Fine.

01:46.079 --> 01:47.545
Breakfast in bed it is.

01:47.547 --> 01:49.047
How do you like your eggs?

01:49.049 --> 01:50.548
(door closes in distance)

01:50.550 --> 01:52.550
Are you really here right now?

01:57.308 --> 01:58.875
Damon?

01:58.900 --> 02:00.499
Wait, Damon's here, too?

02:08.935 --> 02:10.967
Get down here, Caroline.

02:11.705 --> 02:13.504
Now.

Hey, mister, I'm sorry.

02:23.349 --> 02:24.449
Please, just wake up.

02:24.451 --> 02:26.050
Aren't you a little
young to be drinking?

02:26.052 --> 02:27.685
You.

02:27.687 --> 02:30.488
You did this to me, and
now you're making jokes?

02:30.490 --> 02:32.690
It's Violet, right? Just relax.

02:32.692 --> 02:34.843
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:34.868 --> 02:37.761
That's what Caroline said. But look.

02:37.786 --> 02:39.564
You're angry. I get it.

02:39.566 --> 02:41.666
You feel like I forced you into this.

02:41.668 --> 02:43.501
Believe me, I can relate.

02:43.503 --> 02:45.636
My brother forced me into making a deal

02:45.638 --> 02:48.940
with the devil, so that I would
turn innocent girls like you

02:48.942 --> 02:50.742
into monsters so they'd do...

02:50.744 --> 02:53.010
terrible things like this.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.280
This...

02:56.282 --> 02:58.349
this isn't fair.

02:58.351 --> 03:01.619
But life isn't fair, Violet.

03:01.621 --> 03:03.955
See, I gave you a choice.

03:03.957 --> 03:06.424
You didn't have to kill
these people, but you did.

03:06.426 --> 03:07.859
You chose to feed.

03:08.895 --> 03:12.530
And that makes you the
perfect offering for Cade.

03:12.532 --> 03:14.832
What does that mean?

03:14.834 --> 03:16.334
It's a little hard to explain.

03:16.336 --> 03:19.036
Probably easier if I just show you.

03:19.038 --> 03:21.839
(both grunt)

03:26.813 --> 03:27.779
(sighs)

03:27.781 --> 03:29.847
What do you think happened to him?

03:29.849 --> 03:32.550
I'm guessing Sybil happened.

03:32.552 --> 03:33.651
But the real question is:

03:33.653 --> 03:35.853
what did she do to his brain this time?

03:35.855 --> 03:37.188
Only one way to find out.

03:37.190 --> 03:38.289
Can you jump us both

03:38.291 --> 03:39.724
in there?

03:39.726 --> 03:42.660
Will you let me go back to
bed if I tell you I can't?

03:42.662 --> 03:44.495
Not a chance.

03:52.338 --> 03:56.507
<i>(Damon screaming)</i>

03:56.509 --> 03:57.542
(distorted screaming)

03:57.544 --> 03:59.744
(gasps)

03:59.746 --> 04:01.179
- What was that?
- I don't know.

04:01.181 --> 04:04.482
I... It was just fire and pain.

04:04.484 --> 04:06.684
Then that's what Damon's feeling.

04:06.686 --> 04:08.452
Look.

04:08.454 --> 04:10.087
He's suffering.

04:14.527 --> 04:17.795
(Sybil humming)

04:17.797 --> 04:20.765
Wait, do you hear that?

04:20.767 --> 04:23.935
(humming continues)

04:27.540 --> 04:30.942
Well, looks like we
have a rat in the cellar.

04:30.944 --> 04:32.176
Are you annoyed?

04:32.178 --> 04:34.545
I always thought that was
just your resting face.

04:34.547 --> 04:35.880
Let me guess.

04:35.882 --> 04:38.316
Damon's not feeling well.

04:38.318 --> 04:39.584
What did you do to him?

04:39.586 --> 04:40.818
I gave him what he wanted.

04:40.820 --> 04:43.554
I flipped his little
humanity switch back on.

04:43.556 --> 04:45.056
Then why is he a zombie?

04:45.058 --> 04:47.859
Well, I guess his mind couldn't
handle all those memories

04:47.861 --> 04:50.294
and feelings rushing in all at once.

04:50.296 --> 04:53.598
But don't worry, I can fix him,
as long as I get what I want.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.634
You're crazy if you think we're
letting you out of this cell.

04:56.636 --> 04:58.236
You'll mess with our heads, too.

04:58.238 --> 04:59.470
That's the beauty of it...

04:59.472 --> 05:00.872
You don't have a choice.

05:00.874 --> 05:03.007
Pay the price or prepare to have

05:03.009 --> 05:06.277
a catatonic best man at your wedding.

05:06.279 --> 05:08.746
If you're still getting
married, that is.

05:08.748 --> 05:11.949
I know it's looking a little bleak.

05:14.821 --> 05:17.188
What do you want?

05:17.190 --> 05:19.590
(indistinct police radio chatter)

05:19.592 --> 05:21.659
DEPUTY: Hey, Sheriff.

05:23.363 --> 05:25.363
Knock it off. I'm a civilian now.

05:25.365 --> 05:26.797
I hope civilian life treats you better

05:26.799 --> 05:27.932
than that girl in the alley.

05:27.934 --> 05:30.968
- Who is she?
- Violet Fell.

05:30.970 --> 05:33.671
She was a contestant in the Miss
Mystic Falls Pageant yesterday.

05:33.673 --> 05:35.139
Where's the actual sheriff?

05:35.141 --> 05:36.440
Halfway to Duluth.

05:36.442 --> 05:38.376
Jenkins turned in his
badge this morning.

05:38.378 --> 05:39.577
Didn't think a small town like this

05:39.579 --> 05:40.878
came with so many homicides.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.115
(phone ringing)

05:44.117 --> 05:45.983
One second.

05:45.985 --> 05:48.502
This isn't a good time.

05:48.527 --> 05:50.988
Well, this phone call's not
gonna make it any better.

05:50.990 --> 05:52.556
I need the bell.

05:52.558 --> 05:55.326
I just had my dad take it
out of town to hide it. Why?

05:55.328 --> 05:56.494
Because I'm gonna give it to Sybil.

05:56.496 --> 05:57.528
What?

05:57.530 --> 05:58.829
That's crazy, Care.

05:58.831 --> 06:02.066
I know. But Sybil basically
fried Damon's brain,

06:02.068 --> 06:03.935
and now she's the only
one who can fix him.

06:03.937 --> 06:05.469
We have to give her what she wants.

06:05.471 --> 06:06.737
What she wants

06:06.739 --> 06:08.272
is the only weapon that can kill her.

06:08.274 --> 06:10.641
I mean, if we give it to her,
how are we gonna stop her?

06:10.643 --> 06:11.842
I have no idea.

06:11.844 --> 06:14.612
All I know is that Damon
is trapped in his own mind,

06:14.614 --> 06:18.349
and his mind is a volcano
of pain and suffering.

06:18.351 --> 06:19.984
Yeah, well, maybe
that's what he deserves.

06:19.986 --> 06:21.452
You don't mean that.

06:21.454 --> 06:23.254
Yeah, actually I do, Care.

06:23.256 --> 06:24.922
I'm standing at a crime scene right now

06:24.924 --> 06:27.158
where a bunch of people are dead.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.393
And one of them is Violet Fell.

06:30.229 --> 06:32.396
What?

06:32.398 --> 06:36.100
Oh, my God.

06:36.102 --> 06:38.869
(sighs) Matt, I'm so sorry.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.504
Are you?

06:40.506 --> 06:42.206
'Cause no matter how
many innocent people die,

06:42.208 --> 06:44.709
all anyone's ever concerned
about is Stefan and Damon.

06:44.711 --> 06:46.711
You're right.

06:46.713 --> 06:48.546
I'm worried, okay?

06:48.548 --> 06:50.915
I know how messed up
everything is right now.

06:50.917 --> 06:53.918
And if you won't do it for them, please,

06:53.920 --> 06:55.886
do it for me.

06:59.192 --> 07:01.258
(distorted screaming)

07:01.260 --> 07:04.428
You weren't kidding. It's all
fire and brimstone in here.

07:04.430 --> 07:06.897
This is gonna be a lot more
complicated than I thought.

07:06.899 --> 07:09.633
Okay, here's the deal.

07:09.635 --> 07:12.169
Consciously, Damon
believes that he is in hell.

07:12.171 --> 07:13.270
- What?
- For some reason,

07:13.272 --> 07:14.338
Damon thinks that's where

07:14.340 --> 07:15.459
he belongs.

07:15.484 --> 07:17.274
Well, how do we change his mind?

07:17.276 --> 07:19.510
Well, that's a question
only Damon can answer.

07:19.512 --> 07:21.946
So I suggest you go in
there and ask him yourself.

07:21.948 --> 07:23.848
Once you figure out
what's holding him back,

07:23.850 --> 07:25.850
I should be able to repair the damage.

07:25.852 --> 07:27.885
We already tried going
into his head, remember?

07:27.887 --> 07:28.953
Didn't go well.

07:28.955 --> 07:30.221
Yeah, that's 'cause you went

07:30.223 --> 07:31.489
through the front door.

07:31.491 --> 07:33.724
But lucky for you, I can
get you in through the back.

07:33.726 --> 07:36.460
Into his subconscious.

07:37.296 --> 07:39.930
All right, ladies, grab on.

07:51.744 --> 07:54.278
(birds chirping)

07:55.815 --> 07:58.139
Guess the inside of Damon's head

07:58.164 --> 08:00.552
looks a whole lot like the outside.

08:02.588 --> 08:05.790
Okay, come on. Shouldn't take long.

08:12.265 --> 08:14.398
Good morning.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.167
Welcome to the Salvatore Boarding House.

08:16.169 --> 08:18.169
Do you have a reservation, ladies?

08:18.194 --> 08:21.160
Um, I'm not sure.

08:21.185 --> 08:22.684
Do we need one?

08:22.709 --> 08:23.974
I'm afraid so.

08:23.976 --> 08:26.644
The house is at maximum occupancy.

08:26.646 --> 08:28.879
We're looking for Damon Salvatore.

08:28.881 --> 08:30.114
Well, that's easy.

08:30.116 --> 08:32.216
He's right behind you.

08:33.519 --> 08:35.519
I take it back.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.421
This might take a minute.

08:37.423 --> 08:40.658
Mr. Salvatore was a bit
of a hero during the war.

08:40.659 --> 08:42.025
Yeah. We know all that.

08:42.028 --> 08:45.563
Um, but where is he... right now?

08:45.565 --> 08:48.833
You do understand I meant the Civil War.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.471
Hold on a sec. You're Henry.

08:53.473 --> 08:55.906
Damon told me he saved
your life during the war.

08:55.908 --> 08:57.641
So where is he?

08:57.643 --> 09:00.244
I'm going to have to
ask you both to leave.

09:01.681 --> 09:02.813
Now!

09:02.815 --> 09:03.848
Damn it.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.182
- What was that about?
- How are we supposed

09:05.184 --> 09:06.827
- to know?
- Well, what did Damon say?

09:06.852 --> 09:07.785
He didn't say anything,

09:07.787 --> 09:10.020
- because he wasn't there.
- That's impossible.

09:10.022 --> 09:11.222
- It's his mind.
- You're the one

09:11.224 --> 09:12.356
who did this to him.

09:12.358 --> 09:13.691
So un-impossible it.

09:13.693 --> 09:15.392
- Fast.
- Believe me,

09:15.394 --> 09:17.528
I'm trying. But if you
guys can't find Damon,

09:17.530 --> 09:19.385
then there is nothing I can do.

09:19.410 --> 09:21.544
Maybe I can help.

09:21.801 --> 09:23.667
Sorry, I was eavesdropping.

09:23.669 --> 09:25.736
Stefan.

09:25.738 --> 09:27.970
Hello, Caroline.

09:32.156 --> 09:35.417
I told you to stay away from
me. What are you doing here?

09:35.442 --> 09:37.442
I made a mistake.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.244
I'm here to convince you to marry me.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.015
Nah. Honestly,

09:44.017 --> 09:46.351
I'm just here because, when
you killed me last night,

09:46.353 --> 09:49.020
Cade and I had a little
chat, and it turns out

09:49.022 --> 09:50.989
hell needs more souls
than I've been providing.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.925
- And it's time for Damon to do his part.
- (pours drink)

09:53.927 --> 09:56.894
Just wake Damon up so he can
earn his keep, and we're good.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.529
We are trying.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.931
More like failing.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.599
You do know what he's doing, right?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.667
Damon's humanity

10:02.669 --> 10:04.469
is on, which means that he's all emo

10:04.471 --> 10:07.138
and afraid of owning up to
what he did when it was off.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.448
When we were kids,

10:08.473 --> 10:10.860
he used to hide out every
time we did something wrong,

10:10.885 --> 10:14.345
until I'd find him and tell him
everything was gonna be okay.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.048
So, all you need to do is
find out where he's hiding

10:17.050 --> 10:18.416
in there,

10:18.418 --> 10:19.984
and do the exact same thing.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.515
By the way,

10:21.540 --> 10:23.273

my sister uses it against me.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.843
So I'm willing to play ball
with whoever can deliver it.

10:29.868 --> 10:31.378
Well, I'll see what I can do.

10:31.403 --> 10:34.565
In the meantime, fix this.

Uh-huh.

for something I can't change?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.422
No, it isn't,

the person that killed Vicki
was suffering right now?

12:34.145 --> 12:36.479
And that that bell

12:36.481 --> 12:38.614
could either save him,

12:38.616 --> 12:41.884

15:02.960 --> 15:04.994
I know. It's all a little confusing.

15:04.996 --> 15:06.529
Damon was, um...

15:07.432 --> 15:09.398
<i>...is</i> in the Founder's Council,

15:09.400 --> 15:11.996

Honey, I'm sorry, but I have no
idea what you're talking about,

15:19.477 --> 15:22.144
or who Damon Salvatore is.

15:22.146 --> 15:23.979
Um...

15:25.978 --> 15:28.279
Damon is a vampire.

15:28.304 --> 15:31.220
The one behind your
so-called "animal attack."

15:31.222 --> 15:33.756
How do you know about that?

15:33.758 --> 15:35.991
Mom, really, it's fine, okay?

15:35.993 --> 15:38.494

Bonnie. Stay out of this.

long time for this day.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.194
- MATT: I'm not doing this for you.
- Whatever.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.730
All I care about is that you're
willing to destroy my sister.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.698
But you get brownie
points for letting me know

16:24.700 --> 16:27.001
that she's currently
unable to defend herself.

16:27.003 --> 16:28.902
- Just tell me how this works.
- It's easy.

welding the bell back together,

16:31.207 --> 16:33.040
you or he rings it 12 times.

16:33.042 --> 16:35.109
There's got to be more to it than that.

16:35.111 --> 16:36.410
What are you not telling me?

16:36.412 --> 16:38.746
- Why do <i>we</i> have to ring it?
- I know.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.749
It's a silly rule, but
your bloodline forged it,

16:41.751 --> 16:44.752
so your bloodline has to do the honors.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.221
I mean, at least, if
you want to kill a siren

16:47.223 --> 16:49.623
or keep Damon trapped in
that mental hell of his.

16:49.625 --> 16:52.626
STEFAN: I can't let you do that, Matt.

16:52.628 --> 16:55.625
Oh, and Ripper tip: if you're
plotting to murder someone,

16:55.650 --> 16:57.498
you should probably
keep a lower profile.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.533

about people dying?

16:59.535 --> 17:02.736

I decided I needed that bell.

17:02.738 --> 17:04.338
Wait. Why do you want the bell?

17:04.339 --> 17:07.207
Long story short...
Cade needs more souls,

17:07.209 --> 17:10.176
and your sister's better at
making deals than you are.

17:10.179 --> 17:12.246

18:41.770 --> 18:44.538

18:46.642 --> 18:49.409
terrible things to me and my friends,

18:49.411 --> 18:51.411
and I used to hate him for that.

18:51.413 --> 18:54.014
So why are you enduring all this pain

18:54.016 --> 18:57.284
and all this suffering for him?

18:57.286 --> 19:00.654
Because he was the only person

19:00.656 --> 19:05.259
who truly understood how
much it hurt to lose you.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.498
And as strange as it sounds,

19:11.500 --> 19:14.701
that made me forgive
him for everything else.

19:19.542 --> 19:22.543
Good-bye, Caroline.

19:22.545 --> 19:24.711

about you for a second.

19:34.123 --> 19:36.290
And then I got over it.

19:36.292 --> 19:38.258
- What just happened?
- Well, Stefan was right.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.727
Forgiveness is the
key to reaching Damon,

19:40.729 --> 19:42.129
but just not yours.

19:42.131 --> 19:43.964
I hope your friend has better luck.

Always comes with a price.

20:41.056 --> 20:43.790
Now, who exactly are you looking for?

20:43.792 --> 20:46.326
Damon Salvatore.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.661
Name doesn't ring a bell.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.813
- Is he related to Stefan?
- They're brothers.

20:49.838 --> 20:51.215
Oh, then forget about it.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.334
I do not get involved
in vampire business.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.897
And I suggest the same for you.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.838
It's way too late for that.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.974
Pretty much all of my
friends are vampires now.

21:00.976 --> 21:03.043
I'm even in love with one.

21:03.045 --> 21:05.279
Bonnie Bennett, are
you trying to kill me?

21:05.281 --> 21:08.115
I've never been this happy, Grams.

21:08.117 --> 21:11.285
I'm so close to the
life I've always wanted.

21:11.287 --> 21:15.689
Please help me find Damon,
so I can get back to it.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.191
Now, that's cheating.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.661
You know your happiness
means everything to me.

21:20.663 --> 21:23.363
But rules are rules.
I'm gonna need something

21:23.365 --> 21:25.699
that belongs to Damon if
you want me to find him.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.434
He wrote me

21:27.436 --> 21:31.471
a letter once... he was
trying to apologize to me.

21:31.473 --> 21:33.173
It must be around here somewhere.

21:33.175 --> 21:36.476
Have you gone soft, child?
This is <i>my</i> house.

21:36.478 --> 21:38.111
And it's Damon's head.

21:38.113 --> 21:41.181
That means if you're willing to help...

21:41.183 --> 21:44.217
Deep down, Damon wants me to find him.

21:44.219 --> 21:47.020
But if he ever wants me
to know what this says,

21:47.022 --> 21:50.691
he's gonna have to
read it to me himself.

21:53.495 --> 21:56.196
Come on. Concentrate with me.

21:58.434 --> 22:00.600
(low whooshing)

22:04.673 --> 22:05.739
Matt.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.574
What's going on?

22:07.576 --> 22:09.843
We were just outside talking
about how Stefan needs

22:09.845 --> 22:11.511
to send more souls to Cade,

22:11.513 --> 22:13.413
so I offered him a couple thousand.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.815
By tonight.

22:14.817 --> 22:16.883
And then I said that
sounds too good to be true,

22:16.885 --> 22:19.219
and Seline said, "Follow me."

22:19.221 --> 22:20.887
And now you're all caught up.

22:20.889 --> 22:22.887
SELINE: You want those souls?

22:22.912 --> 22:25.926
All you got to do is
make sure that bell rings.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.994
12 times, to be exact.

22:27.996 --> 22:29.196
That wasn't part of the deal.

22:29.198 --> 22:30.497
(groans): Oh.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.399
Did I forget to mention the fine print?

22:32.401 --> 22:33.667
Well, you all know

22:33.669 --> 22:37.771
that the bell is capable
of destroying a siren.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.840
What you don't know is that

22:39.842 --> 22:41.408
it does it with hellfire.

22:41.410 --> 22:46.014
The world Cade created is
really a massive psychic imprint

22:46.039 --> 22:48.039
of the moment of his death.

22:48.684 --> 22:51.351
He was burned at the stake.

22:51.353 --> 22:55.622
Which means his domain is
pretty much a ball of fire.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.692
And the tuning fork
disrupts that energy.

22:58.694 --> 23:01.628
And when it gets amplified
by the striker and bell,

23:01.630 --> 23:05.217
it rips a hole open, straight to Cade.

23:05.242 --> 23:06.733
Sounds dangerous.

23:06.735 --> 23:08.168
(whispers): I like it.

23:08.170 --> 23:11.037
You have no idea. You see, when the door

23:11.039 --> 23:14.875
between this world and
Cade's gets cracked open,

23:14.877 --> 23:16.710
the hellfire it unleashes

23:16.712 --> 23:18.779
doesn't just wipe out any siren

23:18.781 --> 23:20.714
in its proximity,

23:20.716 --> 23:23.817
it wipes out everything, for miles.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.552
In this case...

23:25.554 --> 23:28.088
All of us and Mystic Falls.

23:28.090 --> 23:30.290
I plan on being long
gone before that happens.

23:30.292 --> 23:32.259
So...

23:32.261 --> 23:34.161
what do you say, Stefan?

23:34.953 --> 23:36.897
Would this entire miserable town

23:36.899 --> 23:39.933
be enough souls for
you to betray my sister?

23:46.366 --> 23:48.978
Would you stop that? It's annoying.

23:48.980 --> 23:50.212
Not to mention it shows

23:50.214 --> 23:52.214
a complete lack of confidence in Bonnie.

23:52.216 --> 23:55.584
I have 100% confidence in Bonnie.

23:55.586 --> 23:57.653
I'm not sure the feeling is mutual.

23:57.655 --> 23:59.822
I shouldn't be telling you this,

23:59.824 --> 24:01.690
'cause I snatched it
out of her head, but...

24:01.692 --> 24:03.492
(chuckles): Who am I kidding?

24:03.494 --> 24:05.561
It'll wound you deeply, so it'll be fun.

24:05.563 --> 24:08.263
If Bonnie was really your bestie,

24:08.265 --> 24:09.765
don't you think she would have told you

24:09.767 --> 24:12.167
that she's planning
to give Enzo the cure?

24:12.169 --> 24:15.504
She wants to give the cure to Enzo?

24:16.674 --> 24:17.906
(laughs)

24:17.908 --> 24:20.442
She asked for my advice.

24:20.444 --> 24:23.746
We just... got a little distracted.

24:23.748 --> 24:28.517
Always the case when it comes to
the things <i>she</i> wants, isn't it?

24:30.521 --> 24:32.454
Are those her feelings or yours?

24:32.456 --> 24:34.790
Does it matter if you had to ask?

24:36.594 --> 24:38.360
(gates creak)

24:49.707 --> 24:51.507
MAN: You shouldn't be here, Bonnie.

24:52.977 --> 24:54.676
Damon, is that you?

24:59.483 --> 25:01.183
Please leave.

25:01.185 --> 25:03.285
Or I'll make you.

25:05.156 --> 25:08.023
Why, that siren is evil to the core.

25:08.025 --> 25:10.125
You're not destroying our town.

25:10.127 --> 25:11.794
Aren't I?

25:11.796 --> 25:13.429
Because it's caused
me nothing but trouble,

25:13.431 --> 25:16.432
and the emotional hold
it has over Damon is

25:16.434 --> 25:18.233
worse than a Hallmark card.

25:18.235 --> 25:20.069
You're forgetting one small detail.

25:20.071 --> 25:21.837
You need a Maxwell to ring that bell,

25:21.839 --> 25:23.005
and I'm not touching it.

25:23.007 --> 25:25.307
Hmm. Oh, yes, you are, Matt.

25:25.309 --> 25:28.043
And when you do cause the deaths
of all those innocent people,

25:28.045 --> 25:30.712
I get to mark your
do-gooder soul for Cade.

25:30.714 --> 25:32.337
It's a win-win.

25:32.362 --> 25:33.694
Stay away from him.

25:35.959 --> 25:37.859
I'm sorry. Who are you again?

25:39.023 --> 25:41.356
If you compel me, you're
making the choice for me,

25:41.358 --> 25:43.926
and all that blood will
be on your hands, not mine.

25:43.928 --> 25:46.028
So how badly do you
want me to go to hell?

25:46.030 --> 25:47.362
Pretty badly.

25:47.364 --> 25:48.831
So here's the deal.

25:48.833 --> 25:51.133
The choice is yours, Matt,

25:51.135 --> 25:53.602
but you have to follow your heart.

25:53.604 --> 25:55.037
What's that supposed to mean?

25:55.039 --> 25:57.306
It means that if you don't
want to ring that bell,

25:57.308 --> 25:59.708
you have to forgive Damon
for killing your sister.

25:59.710 --> 26:01.276
And if you can't,

26:01.278 --> 26:03.712
then you have to ring that bell 12 times

26:03.714 --> 26:05.481
by the top of the hour.

26:05.483 --> 26:07.549
(whispers): No excuses.

26:07.551 --> 26:09.151
(pats shoulder)

26:09.153 --> 26:11.687
See you, Matt.

26:16.694 --> 26:18.861
I told you to go!

26:22.644 --> 26:24.778
You can't make me leave.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.270
Damon led me to this
crypt because he wanted me

26:28.272 --> 26:30.072
to find a way to save him.

26:30.074 --> 26:31.974
You can't save him, Bonnie.

26:31.976 --> 26:34.042
Damon killed me... that
makes me the only one

26:34.044 --> 26:35.711
that can ever forgive him for that.

26:35.736 --> 26:37.599
Damon's done a lot of things, Tyler.

26:37.624 --> 26:40.382
Things he's gonna have to spend
the rest of his life atoning for.

26:40.384 --> 26:43.561
And I know that's scary,
but I believe he can do it.

26:44.788 --> 26:46.688
He just has to believe he can.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.925
Damon Salvatore is
dead, and if you ask me,

26:49.927 --> 26:51.393
good riddance.

26:51.395 --> 26:54.296
I'm sorry, Tyler.

26:54.298 --> 26:56.535
That's not how this place works.

27:00.971 --> 27:03.238
And I just figured out how it does.

27:07.611 --> 27:09.278
Hey, you okay?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.979
You need to get Stefan back here.

27:10.981 --> 27:11.980
Why?

27:11.982 --> 27:14.216
Because in Damon's mind,

27:14.218 --> 27:16.985
he lived and died as a human being.

27:16.987 --> 27:18.921
He never became a vampire.

27:18.923 --> 27:20.522
That's the only way he can imagine

27:20.524 --> 27:22.268
keeping the people that he loves safe.

27:22.293 --> 27:23.515
So what?

27:23.540 --> 27:25.440
So our forgiveness isn't what matters.

27:27.131 --> 27:29.331
Damon needs to talk to Stefan.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.432
Just so we're clear,

27:40.457 --> 27:42.258
you calling me isn't why I'm here.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.493
I'm on a tight schedule,

27:43.495 --> 27:45.644
so please, no talking.

27:45.669 --> 27:46.940
Any luck with that bell?

27:46.965 --> 27:48.531
Work in progress.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.166
Any luck with my brother?

27:50.168 --> 27:51.701
Work in progress.

27:54.906 --> 27:57.007
(snaps fingers)

27:57.009 --> 27:59.309
- This is some kind of trick.
- BONNIE: Don't worry.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.611
All you're gonna find
in there is the truth.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.657
Seriously, Damon?

28:13.659 --> 28:15.325
Graveyard?

28:15.327 --> 28:18.028
Could your subconscious
be any more generic?

28:19.564 --> 28:22.232
That was a joke.

28:22.234 --> 28:26.670
Look, I just wanted to drop
in to let you know we're cool.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.973
Whatever you think you did to me,

28:29.975 --> 28:32.008
whatever's holding you back,

28:32.010 --> 28:35.011
it's fine.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.681
Why don't you just get your ass out here

28:37.683 --> 28:39.482
and go back to work.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.787
Hello, brother.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.723
Sweet gargoyle, bro.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.591
You know, you probably
shouldn't be wandering

28:48.593 --> 28:50.460
around here all alone.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.929
There's a killer vampire
on the loose in my head.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.432
Why don't we just cut to the chase, huh?

28:56.668 --> 28:58.768
I'm here to forgive you, Damon.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.837
You must not have gotten the memo.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.707
You see, Bonnie helped
me work through my issues.

29:03.709 --> 29:07.143
And you have the reason
for your visit backwards.

29:07.979 --> 29:10.080
Okay, then.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.581
Enlighten me.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.317
You're not here to forgive me, Stefan.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.722
You're here so I can forgive you.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.190
Can't you just... look, I don't know,

29:20.192 --> 29:22.058
can't you find a way to forgive Damon?

29:22.060 --> 29:23.727
Not in the next ten minutes.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.128
Probably not ever.

29:25.931 --> 29:26.930
Look, I just...

29:26.932 --> 29:28.498
I need you to get out of here.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.967
Go to the cops and save as
many people as you can, okay?

29:30.969 --> 29:33.303
There's no reason that
both of us have to die.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.138
Me running is the whole reason
we're in this mess, Matt.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.039
Here's the difference, Dad.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.640
I want you to abandon me this time.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.209
'Cause when I ring that bell,

29:39.211 --> 29:40.744
all hell's gonna break loose, literally.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.879
Leaving you and your sister
was the biggest mistake

29:42.881 --> 29:45.515
of my life, and I'll be
damned if I do it again.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.283
No, Dad, you'll be damned if you don't.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.286
Maybe! Maybe, but if you
want to ring that bell, Matt,

29:50.288 --> 29:51.855
you're gonna have to go through me.

29:51.857 --> 29:52.889
Don't you get it, Dad?

29:52.891 --> 29:54.571
I <i>will</i> go through you.

29:54.596 --> 29:56.797
I'm compelled. I'm ringing that bell!

29:59.097 --> 30:01.931
Unless you kill me.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.800
What?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.468
What? No.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.270
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:07.272 --> 30:08.371
You have to kill me.

30:08.373 --> 30:10.707
No matter what you do, I'll keep coming.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.642
I'll probably kill you in the process.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.711
Please, Dad.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.513
I'll die a hero.

30:16.709 --> 30:18.942
My life will mean something.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.655
I'm not laying a hand on you, son.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.997
You've been a crap father
my whole life. Why stop now?

30:33.999 --> 30:35.165
(grunts)

30:35.167 --> 30:36.533
(chuckles)

30:36.535 --> 30:38.001
You're kidding me, right?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.502
Think of all the ways that

30:39.504 --> 30:41.738
you have ruined my life
for the last century...

30:41.740 --> 30:43.940
Including the fact that I'm
working for Cade right now

30:43.942 --> 30:45.875
because of you... And
you seriously believe

30:45.877 --> 30:48.545
that you're the one who
should be forgiving me?

30:48.547 --> 30:50.914
You're right.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.582
I'm a monster.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.131
But like I said...

30:56.841 --> 30:59.308
...I forgive you.

31:03.271 --> 31:04.527
(groans)

31:04.529 --> 31:07.697
I have nothing to apologize for.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.267
Then why are you here, Stefan?

31:11.269 --> 31:12.969
Huh?

31:12.971 --> 31:14.304
Why are you always there

31:14.306 --> 31:17.373
to straighten me out
when I go off the rails?

31:17.375 --> 31:20.043
Come on, man, you're not here for Cade.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.930
You're here because you blame yourself

31:21.955 --> 31:23.867
for turning me in the first place.

31:23.892 --> 31:27.027
Apparently, I still do, too.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.253
At least until today.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.490
I officially forgive you.

31:35.366 --> 31:36.759
(grunts)

31:36.761 --> 31:37.894
Shut up!

31:37.896 --> 31:39.462
I forgive you, Stefan.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.631
(grunting)

31:44.836 --> 31:46.903
Why aren't you healing?

31:46.928 --> 31:49.372
Remember that vampire
I was warning you about

31:49.397 --> 31:50.897
running around in my head?

31:51.653 --> 31:54.110
Well, it's not me.

31:54.112 --> 31:55.778
It's you.

31:55.780 --> 31:59.682
It's always been you, Stefan.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.484
So, for the last time,

32:01.486 --> 32:04.854
I forgive you for making me what I am.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.624
I absolve you of all
the death and destruction

32:07.626 --> 32:09.192
I've caused as a result.

32:09.194 --> 32:12.195
And you want to know why?

32:12.197 --> 32:14.664
Because you're my brother.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.099
And I love you.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.880
And there's nothing you could do

32:18.905 --> 32:21.038
to ever change that.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.409
We'll see about that.

32:26.411 --> 32:29.746
You want to forgive me
for something bad, Damon?

32:29.748 --> 32:31.481
Well, how about this?

32:31.483 --> 32:34.851
I'm about to burn Mystic
Falls to the ground.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.495
What the hell are you talking about?

32:36.520 --> 32:38.621
Hell is what I'm talking about.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.023
So before that

32:40.025 --> 32:41.991
beautiful brass bell rings,

32:41.993 --> 32:44.594
forgive me, Damon... I dare you.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.663
And while you're at it,
forgive me for coming here

32:46.665 --> 32:47.830
and trying to save you.

32:47.832 --> 32:50.333
Forgive me for having
the tiniest shred of guilt

32:50.335 --> 32:52.902
about leaving you to
die with everyone else,

32:52.904 --> 32:55.939
for not seeing that the
only way to get rid of you

32:55.941 --> 32:59.509
is to let you go up in flames
with the rest of the damn town.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.649
Come on, Dad! Do something!

33:06.651 --> 33:08.851
(groaning)

33:14.326 --> 33:16.159
(bell tolls)

33:16.161 --> 33:18.328
(Sybil and Bonnie groaning)

33:18.330 --> 33:20.196
Bonnie? Bonnie!

33:20.198 --> 33:21.331
Seline has the bell.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.032
You lied to me.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.735
Yeah, sorry. That was my bad.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.905
Oh, come on. Don't look at me

33:28.907 --> 33:30.239
like that, Caroline.

33:30.241 --> 33:31.774
This is what you wanted, right?

33:31.776 --> 33:34.210
Till death do us part.

33:34.235 --> 33:35.835
(Stefan groans)

33:35.860 --> 33:37.413
You're right, little brother.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.183
I can't forgive you for
destroying our hometown.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.918
'Cause I ain't gonna let it happen.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.187
(neck cracks)

33:46.567 --> 33:47.766
(bell tolls)

33:51.495 --> 33:55.280
- Come on, Dad, do something, please.
- (bell tolling)

33:55.282 --> 33:56.882
Dad, get up!

33:58.686 --> 34:00.219
- Nine!
- (bell tolls)

34:00.221 --> 34:01.687
This thing is heating up!

34:01.689 --> 34:04.189
- (groans) Ten!
- (bell tolls)

34:04.191 --> 34:05.257
You're gonna have to kill me.

34:05.259 --> 34:06.692
Dad, come on!

34:06.694 --> 34:08.159
(groans) Eleven!

34:08.161 --> 34:10.262
(bell tolls)

34:10.264 --> 34:12.864
I'm so sorry, Matt.

34:12.867 --> 34:15.400
(groaning)

34:15.402 --> 34:16.935
I forgive you.

34:17.538 --> 34:19.938
(bell tolls)

34:19.940 --> 34:22.741
Let's hope that one doesn't count.

34:22.743 --> 34:24.710
(gasping)

34:33.987 --> 34:36.621
How are you feeling, sport?

34:36.623 --> 34:39.958
Like I just had my head rammed
into a giant metal object.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.193
Hashtag you're welcome.

34:41.195 --> 34:43.429
Your dad was looking pretty rough, too.

34:43.431 --> 34:45.431
I put the hell bell in
the back of his truck

34:45.433 --> 34:47.065
and sent him on his way.

34:47.068 --> 34:48.233
You're not gonna do anything stupid

34:48.235 --> 34:50.069
like chase after him, are you?

34:50.071 --> 34:52.204
Well, since Stefan compelled
me to ring the bell by 9:00,

34:52.206 --> 34:54.840
I'd say we're in the clear.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.475
For the record, it's hard to thank you

34:56.476 --> 34:58.243
for something that's
pretty much your fault.

34:59.847 --> 35:02.114
Hey. Matt.

35:07.021 --> 35:09.488
I'm sorry about Vicki.

35:09.490 --> 35:11.523
I know you'll never

35:11.525 --> 35:15.527
forgive me for what I did, but...

35:15.529 --> 35:19.031
I should have told you
this a long time ago.

35:21.102 --> 35:24.269
Let me guess, your
emotions are back on, huh?

35:24.271 --> 35:27.106
Yep.

35:27.108 --> 35:30.075
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

35:30.077 --> 35:31.777
Well, you did just save my father

35:31.779 --> 35:34.640
and pretty much the entire town, so...

35:35.416 --> 35:38.283
...that counts for something in my book.

35:40.554 --> 35:42.521
Does that mean we're good?

35:42.523 --> 35:45.491
Not by a long shot.

35:45.493 --> 35:47.993
But you keep earning it
the way you did tonight,

35:47.995 --> 35:50.696
I'm not ruling anything out.

35:52.166 --> 35:54.633
Fair enough.

35:54.635 --> 35:56.568
Need a lift?

35:56.570 --> 35:59.605
Nah. Got to stop by
the police department.

35:59.607 --> 36:03.242
I hear Mystic Falls needs a sheriff.

36:04.612 --> 36:07.412
Always did like the
sheriffs in this town.

36:19.593 --> 36:21.760
(groans softly)

36:26.367 --> 36:30.269
STEFAN: Wow. You really
can't take a hint.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.137
Actually, I can.

36:32.139 --> 36:35.741
So before you try tearing me down again,

36:35.743 --> 36:38.277
I am fully aware

36:38.279 --> 36:40.579
that Damon means more to you than I do.

36:40.581 --> 36:43.081
Then why are you here?

36:43.083 --> 36:44.917
Because I love you,

36:44.919 --> 36:46.351
Stefan.

36:46.353 --> 36:48.687
The other you.

36:48.689 --> 36:50.923
The good you.

36:50.925 --> 36:56.195
But this quarter of a man
I'm staring at isn't you.

36:56.197 --> 36:59.031
Not even remotely.

36:59.033 --> 37:02.367
So if Damon is the answer to
getting your humanity back,

37:02.369 --> 37:05.103
and not me, fine.

37:05.105 --> 37:07.539
I will do whatever it takes.

37:08.843 --> 37:13.045
And we will love each
other forever or we won't.

37:13.047 --> 37:17.382
And we'll make our relationship work...

37:17.384 --> 37:19.484
or we won't.

37:26.227 --> 37:27.826
But either way,

37:27.828 --> 37:29.962
I'm getting you back.

37:32.132 --> 37:33.332

a reflective moment.

It's fine.

38:02.796 --> 38:04.596
I'm reflecting on the good things...

What you did

38:15.910 --> 38:17.276
while you were under Sybil's control

38:17.278 --> 38:18.543

you'll talk me out of running

38:42.469 --> 38:46.705
You're gonna make me face

38:48.976 --> 38:52.945

38:52.947 --> 38:55.080

40:33.781 --> 40:35.714
Can we stop, please?

40:35.716 --> 40:37.916
With the snarkiness and the attitude

40:37.918 --> 40:39.785
and the petty revenge schemes.

40:39.787 --> 40:42.018
- It's exhausting.
- I don't know.

40:42.043 --> 40:43.388
Can we?

40:43.390 --> 40:45.591
Well, if Damon and Stefan
Salvatore can make amends,

40:45.616 --> 40:47.459
then anything's possible.

40:47.461 --> 40:48.527
Okay.

40:48.529 --> 40:49.928
I'll give it a shot.

If you apologize for
screwing me over with Cade.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.734
Me apologize to you? (scoffs)

40:55.736 --> 40:58.270
You're the one that
turned me into cannibal,

40:58.272 --> 41:00.105
and sold my soul into servitude,

41:00.107 --> 41:02.641
and then abandoned
me for over a century.

41:03.777 --> 41:05.343
You're right.

41:05.345 --> 41:07.079
And I'd do it all again.

41:07.081 --> 41:09.781
Because you've always been the weak one.

41:09.783 --> 41:12.184
Fine.

41:12.186 --> 41:14.169
Screw forgiveness.

41:14.194 --> 41:16.221
CADE: My beautiful children.

41:16.223 --> 41:20.092
Still broken after all these years.

41:20.094 --> 41:21.126
Cade.

41:21.128 --> 41:23.462
In the flesh.

41:26.166 --> 41:27.966
How are you here?

41:27.968 --> 41:30.001
The bell rang 11 times.

41:30.003 --> 41:31.803
One shy of visiting
hell upon this Earth,

41:31.805 --> 41:33.872
but enough for me to pay a visit.

41:33.874 --> 41:35.173
SELINE: We can do better.

41:35.175 --> 41:36.408
We'll work together.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.676
That won't be necessary.

41:37.678 --> 41:38.677
(gasps)

41:38.679 --> 41:40.545
I'll handle it from here.
