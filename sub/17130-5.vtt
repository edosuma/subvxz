WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.405
GEORGE, WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WORKING ON CARMEN'S CAR,

00:04.405 --> 00:06.307
CAN YOU HELP ME WITH
THE HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS?

00:06.307 --> 00:09.177
YEAH, SURE, THERE'S JUST
SO MUCH DUST IN THE GARAGE.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.145
(loud sneeze)

00:11.145 --> 00:13.314
OH, MY GOD, MY EYE!

00:14.882 --> 00:17.151
HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.053
(loud sneeze)

00:19.053 --> 00:21.789
LOOK AT ME,
I'M HIDEOUS!

00:23.857 --> 00:24.858
LAME.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.060
GROW UP, DAD.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.528
THEY'RE NOT
BUYING IT, GEORGE.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.997
I CAN SEE THAT.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.733
COME ON,
GET IN THE HALLOWEEN SPIRIT.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.668
WHAT'S YOUR COSTUME
GONNA BE THIS YEAR?

00:34.668 --> 00:36.003
I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING OUT THIS YEAR.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.371
WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.440
YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU STOP,
YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.009
I'M TOO OLD.
I'M ALMOST 14.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.844
GEORGE WENT OUT
TRICK-OR-TREATING

00:43.844 --> 00:46.180
TILL HE WAS 17.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.649
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
I NEEDED THE FOOD.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.719
AND THE NEIGHBORS KNEW,
THEY HAD TO.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.222
WHO GIVES A KID
A WHOLE FROZEN PIZZA?

00:55.623 --> 00:58.526
YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE
COSTUME OF YOURS WAS?

00:58.526 --> 01:00.861
THE ONE WHEN YOU WERE
9 YEARS OLD.

01:00.861 --> 01:01.962
DON'T GO THERE, MOM.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.364
IT'S A GREAT STORY, KIDS.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.065
I'M SERIOUS. DROP IT.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.567
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.370
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU FELT
SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

01:10.271 --> 01:14.875
IT WAS HALLOWEEN NIGHT, 1975,

01:14.875 --> 01:18.078
AND I TOLD GEORGE
HE WAS GOING OUT AS MR. FANCY.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.381
WHO'S MR. FANCY?

01:20.381 --> 01:23.851
OH, NO, I JUST MADE THAT UP
TO TRICK HIM.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.286
THINK ABOUT THIS, KIDS, OKAY?

01:25.286 --> 01:28.656
I PUT HIM IN A LITTLE BLACK HAT,
WITH WHITE GLOVES,

01:28.656 --> 01:32.426
A BIG FAKE MUSTACHE,
AND I PAINTED HIS LIPS RED.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.398
ALL OF THAT
ON HIS BIG BROWN HEAD.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.402
HUH?

01:41.402 --> 01:45.005
(Both) MR. POTATO HEAD!

01:45.005 --> 01:48.376
IT'S NOT FUNNY!

01:48.376 --> 01:50.311
I WALKED AROUND
WITH LIPSTICK ALL NIGHT

01:50.311 --> 01:52.680
TRYING TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY
I WAS MR. FANCY.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.815
THEN MR. PERKINS
DOWN THE STREET SAW ME

01:54.815 --> 01:58.118
AND SAID HE WAS FANCY, TOO,
AND "WELCOME TO THE CLUB."

01:59.587 --> 02:02.290
OH, COME ON, EVERYONE KNEW
YOU WERE MR. POTATO HEAD.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.392
OH, THAT'S WHY
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD

02:04.392 --> 02:06.227
STARTED CALLING YOU "SPUDS."

02:06.227 --> 02:08.996
WELL, I'VE OUTGROWN THAT, OKAY?
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.598
WHATEVER YOU SAY, SPUDS.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.600
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA GO THERE?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.502
'CAUSE I COULD TELL EVERYBODY
THAT WOMAN AT THE MALL

02:14.502 --> 02:17.471
THOUGHT YOU WERE A GIRL,
MAXINE--WATCH OUT.

02:18.906 --> 02:19.873
GEORGE!

02:19.873 --> 02:21.342
WELL, HE NEEDS A HAIRCUT!

02:21.342 --> 02:24.812
NOBODY CALLS ME SPUDS.
I'LL BE IN THE GARAGE.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.416
OKAY, YOUR FATHER'S
A LITTLE UPSET.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.984
YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM SOME TIME
TO CALM DOWN.

02:30.984 --> 02:35.189
OR WE CAN PLAY THE BEST
HALLOWEEN PRANK ON HIM EVER.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.457
MAX, GO GET YOUR SNAKE.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.392
YEAH, LET'S MAKE HIM SCREAM.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.127
THEN WE'LL KNOW
WHO THE REAL GIRL IS.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.329
YES!

02:44.232 --> 02:47.368
GEORGE, THE KIDS HAVE SOMETHING
THEY WANNA SAY TO YOU.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.403
DAD, UM... WE'RE SORRY.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.971
WE THINK IT'S REALLY COOL

02:50.971 --> 02:53.173
THAT YOU STILL TRY TO
SCARE US ON HALLOWEEN.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.475
IT'S JUST THAT
WE'RE GETTING OLDER,

02:54.475 --> 02:56.444
AND YOU CAN'T
FOOL US ANYMORE.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.313
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU GUYS ARE TOO SMART.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.148
SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY ANYMORE.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.417
GUESS THOSE DAYS
ARE GONE, HUH?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.653
LOOK, I GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO IN HERE.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.855
OH, NO PROBLEM.
WE'LL GET DINNER READY, HMM?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.668
SHH.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.096
SNAKE!

03:49.096 --> 03:50.564
(screams)

03:51.699 --> 03:54.101
OH, MY GOD, IT HURTS!
GET ME OUT!

03:54.101 --> 03:55.869
GRAB HIS LEGS!

04:00.007 --> 04:01.542
LOOK WHAT I FOUND!

04:04.378 --> 04:07.515
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:11.184 --> 04:13.053
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:13.053 --> 04:14.622
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:18.225 --> 04:19.593
* THE LOW RIDER

04:19.593 --> 04:23.263
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

04:43.584 --> 04:44.985
MOM!

04:46.487 --> 04:48.689
OH, YOU'RE IN HERE.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.257
HOW COULD YOU NOT
NOTICE ME?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.825
I DON'T KNOW.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.362
HOW DID ALL THOSE GIRLS IN
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL NOT NOTICE YOU?

04:54.362 --> 04:56.364
THEY NOTICED ME.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.432
YOU DON'T SAY,
"STOP FOLLOWING ME, LOSER,"

04:58.432 --> 05:00.734
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
I'M BEHIND YOU.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.736
HEY, LISTEN, FRIDAY NIGHT
I'M HAVING THE GIRLS OVER

05:02.736 --> 05:05.205
TO PLAY POKER,
SO I'M GONNA NEED THE GARAGE.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.174
SORRY, I'M STILL WORKING
ON CARMEN'S CAR.

05:07.174 --> 05:10.444
WELL, THEN WE'LL USE
THE KITCHEN.
NO. YOU KNOW
ANGIE DOESN'T WANT

05:10.444 --> 05:12.279
YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
SMOKING IN HERE.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.714
JUST GO TO ONE
OF THEIR PLACES.

05:13.714 --> 05:17.518
BUT FRIDAY NIGHT, EVERYONE PLAYS
POKER AT MY HOUSE.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.387
AND SINCE MY PLACE
IS BURNED DOWN,

05:19.387 --> 05:20.888
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.256
NO, THIS IS MY HOUSE.
LOOK AROUND.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.058
DO YOU SEE DIRTY ASHTRAYS,

05:25.058 --> 05:27.995
BEER CANS AND A NAKED GUY
WHO LOOKS ASHAMED?

05:29.730 --> 05:32.600
TRUST ME, GEORGE,
I KNOW IT'S YOURS.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.468
I CAN'T HAVE
ANY OF MY FRIENDS OVER?

05:34.468 --> 05:37.104
AND EVERY TIME I CUSS
IN FRONT OF THOSE KIDS,

05:37.104 --> 05:40.841
I HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER DOLLAR
IN THE SWEAR JAR.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.745
YESTERDAY IT COST ME
20 FLIPPIN' DOLLARS.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.915
LISTEN TO ME! I SOUND
LIKE A FREAKIN' NUN!

05:47.915 --> 05:50.884
LOOK, I KNOW THE RULES SOUND
LIKE A BUNCH OF BULL DOODY,

05:50.884 --> 05:53.921
BUT GOSH DARN IT,
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT!

05:53.921 --> 05:55.856
HEY!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WORKING LATE.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.125
YEAH, BUT EVERYONE CUT OUT
TO GO TO THIRSTY'S

05:58.125 --> 05:59.927
AND CELEBRATE
THE BIG ORDER.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.194
WHAT BIG ORDER?

06:01.194 --> 06:04.832
WE JUST GOT A SHIPMENT
OF 81 TIRES. IT JUST CAME IN.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.468
THAT MEANS WE'RE MAKING
MORE LANDING GEAR.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.770
WHICH MEANS MORE OVERTIME.
CHA-CHING!

06:09.770 --> 06:11.972
I DIDN'T ORDER 81 TIRES.
I ORDERED 18.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.974
WHY CAN'T THAT STUPID SUPPLIER
DO HIS JOB RIGHT?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.043
IT SAYS RIGHT HERE ON
MY PAPERWORK THAT I ORDERED...

06:16.043 --> 06:20.113
81 TIRES.
WELL, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.615
IT'S YOUR DYSLEXIA.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.751
YOU REVERSED THE NUMBERS,
DIDN'T YOU?

06:23.751 --> 06:26.954
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP, GEORGE.
WE JUST GOT A HUGE ORDER.

06:26.954 --> 06:30.424
NOBODY'S GONNA CARE
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE MISTAKE.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.225
ERNIE, THERE IS NO HUGE ORDER.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.428
I SCREWED UP AND ORDERED
A BUNCH OF EXTRA TIRES.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.830
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.767
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
YOU ASKED ME THAT.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.134
YOU WERE 13.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.904
THAT'S 31 TO YOU.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.840
WAY TO GO, SPUDS.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.844
OH, MAN.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.714
SHE JUST TREATED YOU LIKE
SHE DID WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.916
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.051
YEAH, SHE EVEN FLICKED YOU
IN THE HEAD AND EVERYTHING.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.587
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.822
NO, YOU'RE THINKING
OF SOMEBODY ELSE.
NO, THAT WAS YOU.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.859
'CAUSE I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.628
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
REMEMBER THIS!

07:07.628 --> 07:10.498
COME ON, GEORGE, YOU'D BE
SITTING AT THE TABLE

07:10.498 --> 07:13.667
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK...

07:16.003 --> 07:19.740
WHAT AM I DOING? DON'T LOOK OFF
IN THE DISTANCE! OH, NO.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.891
MOM!

07:40.293 --> 07:43.163
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN
YOUR ROOM DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.965
THERE'S A RAT IN THERE.

07:44.965 --> 07:49.002
WHAT? OH, I SET
A TRAP YESTERDAY!

07:49.002 --> 07:52.940
I GOT HUNGRY LAST NIGHT
AND ATE THE CHEESE. SORRY.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.880
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT KNOCKING?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.816
THAT YOU'D BE FULLY WITHIN
YOUR RIGHTS AS A HOMEOWNER

08:02.816 --> 08:05.152
TO SHOOT ME IF I DON'T?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.620
THANK YOU.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.990
OH, HEY, BEFORE I FORGET,
THERE'S A GUY COMING

08:09.990 --> 08:12.192
FROM THE GAS COMPANY TOMORROW
WITH THE BILL.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.027
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:14.027 --> 08:20.233
YEAH. NO HABLO INGLÃ©S, SEÃ‘OR,
YO TENGO T.B. (coughs)

08:20.233 --> 08:22.002
HEY, GEORGE,

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
WHEN I WAS GETTING BEAT UP
ON THE BUS TODAY,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.006
THEY SHOVED MY HEAD
BETWEEN TWO SEATS

08:26.006 --> 08:28.208
AND I FOUND
YOUR MATH TEST IN THERE.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.643
THAT WAS LUCKY, HUH?

08:31.779 --> 08:34.782
YOU GOT AN "F" IN MATH?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.917
WAY TO GO, SPUDS.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.621
I REALLY TRIED
THIS TIME, MOM.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.623
THIS IS GONNA STAY
ON THE FRIDGE

08:42.623 --> 08:44.625
UNTIL YOU BRING IN
A BETTER GRADE.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.127
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'LL LEARN.

08:47.127 --> 08:51.732
JEEZ, GEORGE, GOD GAVE YOU THAT
BIG HEAD BUT A LITTLE BRAIN.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.533
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WALK
DOWNSTAIRS,

08:53.533 --> 08:58.071
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
SHAKING A CAN OF SPRAY PAINT.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.675
I'LL SHOW HER.
I'LL GET AN "A."

09:01.675 --> 09:03.677
AND THEN SHE'LL HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE

09:03.677 --> 09:07.114
AND TAKE ME OUT
FOR ICE CREAM AND PIZZA.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.250
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA PLAY
CENTERFIELD FOR THE DODGERS

09:10.250 --> 09:12.485
AND MARRY FARRAH FAWCETT.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.188
I LIKE IT
WHEN WE PLAY PRETEND.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.061
OH, FARRAH FAWCETT
AND THE DODGERS--

09:21.061 --> 09:24.297
GOLLY, WE HAD SOME
CRAZY DREAMS, DIDN'T WE?

09:24.297 --> 09:26.099
I JUST WANTED AN "A"

09:26.099 --> 09:29.937
AND A BEDROOM WITHOUT
LITTLE RAT PELLETS EVERYWHERE.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.373
SO...

09:33.373 --> 09:35.308
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.310
UH...

09:39.179 --> 09:43.250
OKAY, ERNIE LIKES IT.
GEORGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.853
AND CAREFUL, IF I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ANSWER,

09:45.853 --> 09:49.723
I'LL HAVE TO CUFF YA
AND TAKE YOU DOWNTOWN.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.525
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.027
FINE?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.029
I'VE BEEN AT THE GYM EVERY DAY
FOR THREE MONTHS

09:56.029 --> 09:58.165
TO FIT INTO THIS
AND IT'S JUST "FINE?"

09:58.165 --> 10:03.704
HEY, I DID THE CRIME.
MAKE ME DO THE TIME.

10:03.704 --> 10:07.240
I GOT IT.
YOU LIKE IT, ERNIE.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.441
GEORGE?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.643
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:09.643 --> 10:11.344
MY MOM'S TREATING ME
LIKE CRAP.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.346
I'M SORRY, HONEY, BUT YOUR MOM
ALWAYS TREATS YOU LIKE CRAP.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.016
WHY ARE YOU LETTING IT
GET TO YOU?
'CAUSE THIS IS DIFFERENT.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.986
I MEAN, SHE'S DOING STUFF TO ME
SHE DID WHEN I WAS A KID.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.022
IF IT BOTHERS YOU THAT MUCH,
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.225
NO, FORGET IT.
THAT'S ONLY GONNA MAKE IT WORSE.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.227
BENNY, WE NEED TO TALK.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.097
WHAT DID I JUST SAY? WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS HAVE TO GET INVOLVED?

10:30.097 --> 10:32.833
BECAUSE SHE TOOK AN OATH
TO PROTECT AND SERVE.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.835
SHE'S ONE
OF L.A.'s FINEST.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.237
THAT'S RIGHT!

10:38.739 --> 10:41.008
I'M OUT.
I'LL BE AT THIRSTY'S.

10:46.579 --> 10:50.183
SO IT'S COME TO THIS.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.153
YOU'RE WORKING
BACHELOR PARTIES.

10:53.153 --> 10:57.390
BENNY, GEORGE HAS
SOME ISSUES WITH YOU.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.893
AND I THINK WE SHOULD SIT DOWN
AND AIR THEM OUT LIKE ADULTS.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.194
GEORGE, SIT.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.863
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:02.863 --> 11:05.799
WHAT DID BENNY DO
TO MAKE YOU SO UPSET?

11:05.799 --> 11:08.936
SHE TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF
ON ME.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.604
I WANTED
TO SAVE ELECTRICITY.

11:11.604 --> 11:15.208
I KNOW IT COSTS YOU MORE MONEY
FOR ME TO BE STAYING HERE.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.277
WELL, THAT KINDA MAKES SENSE.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.479
YEAH, WELL,
SHE FLICKED ME IN THE HEAD.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.348
AND SHE CALLED ME "SPUDS."

11:21.348 --> 11:22.549
BENNY?

11:22.549 --> 11:24.351
THAT'S HOW I SHOW AFFECTION.

11:24.351 --> 11:29.489
I'M SORRY IF I'M NOT
THE BIGGEST HUGGER IN THE WORLD.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.224
ANYTHING ELSE?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.326
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU DON'T GET IT.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.162
WELL, I THINK I DO.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.164
SINCE YOU GUYS ARE LIVING
TOGETHER AGAIN,

11:37.164 --> 11:39.166
IT'S BRINGING UP
OLD ISSUES.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.368
BUT IF YOU DON'T TALK
ABOUT THIS STUFF,

11:41.368 --> 11:45.238
LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDINGS
CAN BECOME BIG RESENTMENTS.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.174
YEAH, YOU'D BE A GREAT COP
IN INTERROGATION.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.376
"IF I TELL YOU
THAT I'M THE ZODIAC KILLER,

11:49.376 --> 11:53.713
"WILL YOU JUST PLEASE
STOP TALKING?"

11:53.713 --> 11:57.417
I WAS GONNA DO UNDERCOVER WORK
TONIGHT, BUT FORGET IT.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.690
YOU CAN'T COME TO ME
TO COMPLAIN?

12:03.690 --> 12:06.794
YOU GOTTA RUN
TO THE MAN OF THE HOUSE?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.829
YOU'RE TREATING ME
LIKE A KID.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.131
IF I WERE TREATING YOU
LIKE A KID, GEORGE,

12:11.131 --> 12:14.434
I WOULD CIRCLE THE MISTAKE
ON YOUR INVENTORY.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.236
I WOULD GIVE YOU
AN "F."

12:16.236 --> 12:18.505
AND I WOULD PUT THIS
ON THE FRIDGE

12:18.505 --> 12:21.474
UNTIL YOU COME HOME
WITH A BETTER REPORT.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.443
HEY, TAKE THAT DOWN!
NO.

12:26.146 --> 12:30.784
I THINK SOMEONE NEEDS
TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.886
FROM NOW ON,
THE TV GOES OFF AT 8.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.289
HURTS, DON'T IT?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.160
YOU DON'T DO THAT
IN FRONT OF MY KIDS, ALL RIGHT?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.195
I NEED TO BE RESPECTED
IN THIS HOUSE.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.231
MAX!
LOOK AT THIS OTHER REPORT.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.733
DADDY SPELLED "HYDRAULICS"
RIGHT. NO, NOT THAT ONE.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.368
THIS ONE!

12:52.840 --> 12:54.842
OKAY, VIC, SWING THROUGH
THE BALL, OKAY?

12:54.842 --> 12:57.144
RELAX YOUR GRIP
AND KEEP YOUR LEFT ARM STRAIGHT.

13:02.115 --> 13:06.686
(speaking Spanish)

13:06.686 --> 13:08.188
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COOL

13:08.188 --> 13:10.190
WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING OPEN
A HUMAN HEART,

13:10.190 --> 13:12.792
BUT GOLFING IN MY BACKYARD
IS TOO MUCH PRESSURE?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.527
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.963
IF I HOOK ONE

13:15.963 --> 13:18.465
INTO A SAND TRAP TOMORROW
AT THE HOSPITAL BENEFIT,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.869
I WILL BE LAUGHED AT
BY A MALE NURSE.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.904
THAT'S LIKE YOU
BEING MOCKED BY A, UH...

13:23.904 --> 13:25.906
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S BENEATH YOU.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.842
LET'S SAY--
A HOMELESS MAN.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.046
VIC, I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED
YOU'RE GONNA BE HUMILIATED

13:33.046 --> 13:35.048
AT THIS TOURNAMENT,
BUT JUST REMEMBER THIS--

13:35.048 --> 13:38.051
YOU SUCK, AND I'M NOT
HELPING YOU NO MORE.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.722
THE KIDS AND I ARE GOING
TO CARMEN'S POETRY READING.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.191
OH, MAN,
DO I HAVE TO GO?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.326
NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.328
UNLESS YOU WANNA SUPPORT
YOUR DAUGHTER

13:48.328 --> 13:51.031
AND SHOW HER THAT YOU CARE
ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO HER.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.766
THANK GOD.
LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.768
WELL, WE WON'T
BE HOME TILL LATE.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.771
TRY NOT TO KILL
YOUR MOM.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.440
FIGHTING WITH BENNY?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.009
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:02.009 --> 14:06.046
YOU KNOW, THIS REMINDS ME
OF A TIME IN CUBA--

14:06.046 --> 14:08.548
OKAY, YOU'VE BROKEN ME.
I'LL TALK.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.917
MY MOM'S HOUSE BURNS DOWN.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.551
I TAKE HER IN
BECAUSE I'M A GOOD SON.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.287
AND SHE TREATS ME LIKE I'M
AN 8-YEAR-OLD IN MY OWN HOUSE.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.490
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS HERE.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.027
YOU HAVE REVERSED ROLES
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.429
SHE'S NOW DEPENDENT
ON YOU.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.098
SO THE LESS SHE FEELS
LIKE A PARENT,

14:25.098 --> 14:27.100
THE MORE SHE'S GONNA
TREAT YOU LIKE A CHILD.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.536
IT'S A CLASSIC
POWER STRUGGLE.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.238
I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HER HEAD.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.240
I JUST WANT IT TO STOP.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.075
WELL, PERHAPS
I CAN HELP.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.277
WHEN EMELINA AND I
WERE IN COUPLES' THERAPY

14:37.277 --> 14:41.081
I LEARNED HOW TO DEAL
WITH UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.683
VIC, YOU GOT DIVORCED.

14:43.683 --> 14:49.256
IT HELPED ME.
SHE, HOWEVER, REMAINED A WHORE.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.691
BUT WHAT I LEARNED
IS THAT--

14:51.691 --> 14:55.362
PEOPLE IN BAD RELATIONSHIPS
ARE LIKE ACTORS

14:55.362 --> 15:01.834
PLAYING OUT THE SAME TRAGEDY
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY...

15:01.834 --> 15:04.304
GETTING DROWSY,
MUST HEAR POINT.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.875
THE POINT IS--
IF YOU WANT A HAPPIER ENDING,

15:08.875 --> 15:10.443
YOU MUST CHANGE THE SCRIPT.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.513
IF SHE'S MEAN TO YOU,
INSTEAD OF LASHING OUT,

15:13.513 --> 15:17.584
TRY BEING NICE.
EVENTUALLY, SHE WILL GIVE UP.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.821
IT WILL BE LIKE
KILLING HER WITH KINDNESS.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.557
OKAY, KILLING HER.
GO ON.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.727
SO AS A RULE OF THUMB,

15:27.727 --> 15:31.931
WHEN YOU WANT TO CHOKE HER,
GIVE HER A HUG INSTEAD.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.700
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TRY IT.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.702
BUT IF I'M HUGGING HER TOO HARD
AND SHE CAN'T BREATHE,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.904
I WAS TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING NICE, RIGHT?

15:37.904 --> 15:39.706
THAT'S OUR STORY.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.081
WHAT'S THAT?

15:48.081 --> 15:51.251
YOU SCREW SOMETHING ELSE UP
AT WORK?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.320
YOU COULD'VE TURNED
THE LIGHTS OFF ON ME,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.855
BUT INSTEAD YOU SHOWED
INTEREST IN MY DAY.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.758
THANK YOU, MOTHER.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.694
WHO BLEW A FEATHER
UP YOUR SKIRT, MR. FANCY?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.730
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT SKIRTS YOU--

16:03.730 --> 16:06.366
LOOK LOVELY JUST AS YOU ARE
IN THAT BLOUSE

16:06.366 --> 16:09.136
AND THOSE
ADJUSTABLE PANTS.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.571
ARE YOU DRUNK?

16:11.571 --> 16:14.874
NOPE. I'M CHANGING
THINGS FOR THE BETTER.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.943
GOOD FOR YOU,
TONY ROBBINS.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.911
CLEAR YOUR STUFF
OFF THE TABLE.

16:18.911 --> 16:22.682
ANGIE CALLED AND SHE WANTS ME
TO GET DINNER GOING.
I'LL DO IT IN A SECOND.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.218
I JUST NEED TO READ
THE NEW WORKER'S COMP POLICY.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.988
SO THEN WE'LL EAT IN,
WHAT, FIVE YEARS?

16:30.657 --> 16:34.994
SO CLEVER. YOU FOUND FUN
IN MY LEARNING DISABILITY.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.266
GIVE ME A HUG, MOM.
IT'LL BE OVER QUICKLY.

16:48.441 --> 16:52.445
Hello?
VIC, IT'S NOT WORKING, MAN.
I'M GONNA SNAP.

16:52.445 --> 16:57.150
YOU NEED TO GIVE IT TIME.
IT COULD TAKE MONTHS.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.752
HEY, NO ONE CHANGES
THEIR PATTERNS OVERNIGHT.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.388
YEAH, OKAY, I'LL DO THAT.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.324
HEY, ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
SUBJECT--YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.560
WHAT POISONS WON'T
SHOW UP ON AN AUTOPSY?

17:07.560 --> 17:10.397
GEORGE, CALM DOWN.

17:10.397 --> 17:14.467
IMAGINE THE PRESSURES
OF THE WORLD ARE A BIRD.

17:14.467 --> 17:20.507
AND THEY ARE FLAP,
FLAP, FLAPPING AWAY.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.976
HOW MANY MOJITOS
HAVE YOU HAD?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.445
NONE.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.348
I'M ONLY DRINKING
HOT TEA.

17:28.348 --> 17:32.285
IT HELPS THE PAINKILLERS
KICK IN.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.993
WHERE'S MY WORK?

17:40.993 --> 17:44.531
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
MY RULES?

17:44.531 --> 17:46.399
WHAT RULES?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.901
I ONLY TELL YOU ONCE
TO CLEAR THE TABLE.

17:48.901 --> 17:53.940
IF YOU DON'T, YOU ARE ASKING ME
TO THROW OUT YOUR STUFF.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.509
YOU THREW OUT
MY WORK?

17:56.509 --> 18:00.480
YEP. MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU'LL REMEMBER MY RULES.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.417
HEY, THIS IS MY HOUSE.
I MAKE THE RULES.
OH, SURE YOU DO.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.454
MOM, STAND STILL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.422
TALK ALL YOU WANT.
I WILL PRETEND TO LISTEN.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.392
MOM, DON'T IGNORE ME.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.296
LET'S SEE. WHAT GOES GOOD
WITH CHICKEN?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.765
I DON'T KNOW.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.768
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU--
GEORGE?!

18:21.768 --> 18:23.770
YOU'RE GONNA STAND THERE,
AND YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN TO ME.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.972
STOP TREATING ME LIKE A KID.
STOP CALLING ME NAMES.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.474
I'M A GROWN MAN.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.741
AND IF I WANT TO,
I CAN LEAVE MY PAPERS ANYWHERE.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.443
AND I PAY THE BILLS
AROUND HERE,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.612
SO IF I WANT TO LEAVE
THE LIGHTS ON, I CAN--

18:32.612 --> 18:33.946
AND THE MIXER

18:33.946 --> 18:35.882
AND THE TOASTER
AND THE BLENDER

18:35.882 --> 18:38.485
AND THE FOOD PROCESSOR
AND THE MICROWAVE.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.553
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
I CAN AFFORD IT ALL.

18:40.553 --> 18:44.457
BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAILURE.
I'M A BIG SUCCESS!

18:47.360 --> 18:49.662
I'M A BIG, BIG SUCCESS!

18:52.665 --> 18:53.633
GEORGE?

18:55.034 --> 18:56.503
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.706
DO YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER
HAS A DRUG PROBLEM?

19:07.013 --> 19:09.115
OOH.
OOH.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.650
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:10.650 --> 19:14.387
I ASKED HIM TO CLEAR THE TABLE,
AND HE LOST HIS MIND.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.757
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.328
I'M STILL SHAKY.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.663
BUT I'LL FINISH DINNER
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.465
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

19:25.465 --> 19:30.270
THEN I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF
CHICKEN IN MY ROOM WITH A BEER.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.413
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
LOOK,
YOU DON'T SEE IT, ANGIE.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.681
SHE'S DIFFERENT
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.683
BUT THIS TIME
SHE PUSHED ME TOO FAR.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.353
SO YOU HANDCUFFED HER
TO THE FRIDGE?

19:46.353 --> 19:47.754
YES, I DID!

19:47.754 --> 19:49.956
BECAUSE BEATING HER
WITH A ROLLING PIN

19:49.956 --> 19:52.525
SEEMED TOO CARTOONY.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.962
YOU HAVE GOTTA
GET THIS UNDER CONTROL.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.897
LOOK, I TRIED, ANGIE.
I REALLY DID.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.532
BUT I CAN'T LIVE WITH
HER ANYMORE. SHE'S GOTTA GO.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.901
WE ARE NOT GONNA THROW
YOUR MOM OUT ON THE STREET.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.135
FINE, THEN I'M GOING.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.637
GEORGE, YOU'RE BEING
RIDICULOUS.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.173
NO, I'M NOT. IT'S EITHER
HER OR ME. YOU CHOOSE.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.008
I AM NOT
PLAYING THIS GAME.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.543
THEN I'M LEAVING.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.679
IF YOU ACTUALLY
WALK OUT THAT DOOR,

20:12.679 --> 20:16.015
IT WOULD JUST BE AN INCREDIBLY
IMMATURE GESTURE ON YOUR PART.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.452
OH, AND YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF THAT? WATCH THIS.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.553
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.555
ANYWHERE
MY MOM ISN'T.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.557
AND FROM NOW ON, I ONLY LIVE
WHERE I'M TREATED LIKE A MAN

20:24.557 --> 20:26.693
WITH THE DIGNITY I DESERVE.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.199
HEY, LOOK OUT!

20:33.199 --> 20:34.801
TSUNAMI!

20:42.775 --> 20:44.677
HEY, GEORGE,

20:44.677 --> 20:47.079
COULD YOU HELP MY DAD
PASS OUT HALLOWEEN CANDY?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.382
WHERE YOU GOING?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.751
UH, I GOTTA RUN SOME ERRANDS.
I'LL SEE YA.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.885
OH, WHOA.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.121
ERNIE, WHAT ARE YOU
WEARING UNDER THAT COAT?

20:55.121 --> 20:57.023
NOTHING.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.891
GOD, I HOPE YOU'RE LYING.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.263
ERNIE, WHAT'S UNDER
THE COAT?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.933
NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

21:06.933 --> 21:08.735
BUT...

21:08.735 --> 21:11.304
PUH-POW!

21:15.442 --> 21:17.444
I GUESS NO LITTLE BALLERINA
IS GONNA STEAL

21:17.444 --> 21:19.011
ANY OF YOUR CANDY
THIS YEAR,

21:19.011 --> 21:19.712
HUH, BIG GUY?
HEY!
