who rides over a giant waterfall
in a barrel

01:22.749 --> 01:24.083

to take such a stupid risk.

the kingdom would be lost.

keep bowing, right?

it's a little weird to bow that much.

Ah, I am called Koto.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.396
Respeck. I am King Julien,

he would never listen to us.

-And now, he's probably all soggy and dead

and I will find him.

it's probably not even that--

04:53.960 --> 04:56.045
Thanks for hooking up the warmth, Koto,

04:56.129 --> 05:00.550
but it kind of seems like saving your life
would be worth a bigger fire.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.804
Not huge, but a tad bigger.
A smidge. A skosh.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.390
A large fire could attract predators.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.768
Or it could let your homies know
that you're safe.

was wiped out by the foosa.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.618

my kingdom hasn't been wiped out yet.

Not cool, Koto. Not cool.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.596
You know this savage?

06:28.679 --> 06:32.725
I make friends everywhere I go.
I got bros in different area codes.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.937
Sometimes I break into flows.
That's how it goes.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.981
-Oh!
-Are you injured?

06:40.024 --> 06:44.153
[stutters] Oh, no. Foot's a bit sore,
but otherwise, tip-top.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.864
You fight like the warrior queens
of my tribe.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.868
They were brutal, ruthless
and killed without mercy.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.621
I bet you say that
to all the ladies. [chuckles]

06:54.539 --> 06:56.666
This should aid in your healing.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.459

06:58.626 --> 07:00.294
Ack-thoo!

07:01.212 --> 07:03.214
[munching]

07:04.215 --> 07:05.424
Sounds like the storm is letting up.

-I... [chuckles] I suppose.
-Jiggy, jee...

As of this morning,
King Julien and Clover are still missing.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.157
We need to divide into search parties.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.541
It's not that kind of party.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.961
Oh. So, what is it?
More of a cocktail reception?

07:42.044 --> 07:44.797
[groans in exasperation]
Ted, you're with Pancho.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.092
Okay, when we find them,
you want 'em dead or alive?

07:48.176 --> 07:50.219
Alive! What is wrong with you?

07:50.303 --> 07:53.347
Well, excuse me for being thorough,
Maurice!

07:53.973 --> 07:54.849
[groaning]

07:54.932 --> 07:59.145
Everybody, pair off and fan out
into every direction. No time to waste.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.189
All right, so, I'm with you.
Are you with me?

08:01.272 --> 08:04.609
It's hot, so we should all stay
plenty hydrated.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.029
Wouldn't it be easier if we just chose
two idiots to replace 'em?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.158
Sorry, baby. I gotta go search.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.119
I sure hope they find them quickly.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.413
Yeah, I'm worried sick.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.457
What are you still doing here, Willie?

08:19.540 --> 08:25.213
Uh... I have... bone spurs in my feet,
so... [chuckles nervously]

08:25.296 --> 08:27.632

08:27.757 --> 08:28.633
[groans]

the cowardly guy saves the day.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.807
-[crying] You're alive!
-Uh-huh.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.476
What got into him?

08:38.559 --> 08:42.396
Somebody show him a video
of a lion cuddling a baby monkey?

08:42.480 --> 08:43.856

is indeed amusing.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.788
Smothered in bird dung? Classic.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.249
Hmm...

09:01.332 --> 09:03.626
Oh, we were worried sick, Your Majesty!

09:03.709 --> 09:07.588
No need to worry about me.
This guy here is a great warrior.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.298
And I saved him!

09:09.382 --> 09:12.301
So, basically,
I'm pretty sure I'm unkillable.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.428
Wait, where is everyone?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.722
When you didn't come back,
we formed search parties.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.726
What... Search parties? You thought
I couldn't protect the king myself?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.853
No... I... [stuttering]

09:22.937 --> 09:26.816
You thought, "Well, if Clover
can't handle it, Horst sure can!

09:26.899 --> 09:29.277
Oh, yeah, let's send Pancho out there.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.361
You can always trust him

09:30.444 --> 09:31.362
-to get the job done!"

the tour of the village?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.894
It pleased me.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.856
Although I feel you put
far too much emphasis

10:06.939 --> 10:09.942
on trampolines and waterslides.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.319
Thank you very much.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.696
What truly fascinates me is

10:13.779 --> 10:17.450
how weak and bad at fighting
most of your citizens seem.

10:17.533 --> 10:21.787
Oh, yeah. Well, we settle
most of our disputes with dance-offs.

10:21.871 --> 10:26.125
And no walls or gates
enclose your city. Huh.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.377
Yeah, we had a wall once.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.506
But it kind of killed the chilled-out
festival vibe we were going for.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.424
Uh-huh.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.594
[grunts] Hello, hello.
Sorry to barge in, but I...

10:36.677 --> 10:40.014
Oh, you're right, it does appear
that there is... there's room for...

10:40.097 --> 10:42.600
one more. Yeah, that's me.
Don't mind if I do.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.353

-Hey, watch it.

Uh. This is nice, huh?

10:50.358 --> 10:51.484
[bird squawking]

10:51.567 --> 10:53.653
[grunts] I come with an urgent warning.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.404
Oh, yes, you're right.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.615
It does appear there is room for one more.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.785
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot...
[sighs in relief]

11:00.868 --> 11:02.870
Hello, Babak.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.998
That name is dead to me, Koto.
I now go by...

11:06.082 --> 11:09.585
[screams unintelligibly]

11:09.669 --> 11:11.337
What, eh... You guys know each other?

11:11.420 --> 11:14.423
Koto shouldn't be here.
He is a wolf, dressed like a sheep,

11:14.507 --> 11:17.635
wrapped in an enigma,
with henna-tattoo lies all over him.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.304
-With a sheep? With a hat? With a...
-A wolf... Come on, now.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.681
-Didn't I tell you, he always does this.
-I don't even know what that E-word was.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.600
You must banish him from the kingdom.

11:24.683 --> 11:25.976
Whoa! Hey!

11:26.060 --> 11:28.687
We don't use the B-word around here!

11:28.771 --> 11:31.607
Koto is in a very vulnerable place
right now because

11:31.690 --> 11:35.653
his whole kingdom got wiped out,
and he's the last of his kind.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.030
All wiped out?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.490
Yep, all.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.326
Koto, is this true?
How could you let that happen?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.955
Uh, Sage, why do you know so much
about my new bro?

11:46.038 --> 11:48.249
Because Koto is not your bro.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.335
He's my bro-ther.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.755
-Hmm?
-[gasps]

11:54.839 --> 11:55.965

12:00.469 --> 12:01.929
-[growls]
-Hmm?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.848
Ha! [growls]

12:04.432 --> 12:07.017
Uh, again, I don't really understand.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.272
[rattling]

12:11.772 --> 12:14.483
...and I told her, "I didn't sign up
for this kick-boxing class

12:14.567 --> 12:17.403
to make friends. I'm here
to channel my rage and hurt people."

12:17.486 --> 12:19.697
-[screams]
-Yo, hotchy-motchy!

12:19.780 --> 12:22.032
-Did you see the size of that snake?
-Hmm?

12:25.202 --> 12:28.497
Do you see things like that a lot, Horst?

12:29.331 --> 12:31.333
How can you be certain that my...

12:31.417 --> 12:34.211
I mean,
Koto's kingdom was really destroyed?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.212
[laughs]

12:35.296 --> 12:37.756
Why would he lie about something
like that?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.551
Why does the oak tree
pretend to be an acorn?

12:40.634 --> 12:43.387
Has anyone ever told you you're,
like, super weird?

12:43.471 --> 12:48.058
Yes. Koto is the last planted seedling
in my familial garden.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.728
Are you trying to say
[shouts] he's your younger brother?

12:50.811 --> 12:53.939
When I shed the shackles
of kings and crowns,

12:54.148 --> 12:56.901
Koto took my place
as the ruler of our people.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.945
Hold the front door! Koto is a king?

13:00.029 --> 13:03.449
I've been talking to him
like he's a common loser this whole time.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.869
Yes. I forsook the throne
to find my truth, and...

13:07.536 --> 13:09.788
to eat twigs and pine cones.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.249
Koto chose the easy path.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.294
I doubt he's ever even had to survive
on his own urine.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.337
Hmm.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.297
You sure you're not just jealous

13:18.380 --> 13:21.133
that Koto is on a date with Clover?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.302
A... date?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.345
Whoa.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.265
There's something I've been meaning
to ask you.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.434
You seem to be an excellent fighter.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.687
How exactly did your kingdom
get wiped out by the foosa?

13:34.271 --> 13:37.024
You think my story is dishonest?

13:37.149 --> 13:39.485
Well, it's my job to be suspicious.
[exclaims]

13:39.568 --> 13:41.070
[giggling]

13:41.403 --> 13:43.197
-Do you not find me trustworthy?
-Huh?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.740
No, no, no, just, uh...

13:46.784 --> 13:47.618
[giggles]

13:47.993 --> 13:50.287
What were we just talking about?

13:50.371 --> 13:55.167
I hope it's not too forward of me
to say you eat as much as a man.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.505
You really know how to make
a girl feel special.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.548
[chuckles nervously]

14:00.923 --> 14:04.176
And, yes, yeah, I do work up
quite an appetite

14:04.260 --> 14:06.470
being the kingdom's only line of defense.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.347
Eh. Mmm.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.434
It truly is only you
watching over all of them?

14:12.518 --> 14:16.146
Well, there is an assistant captain
of the ring tail guard.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.607
[screaming, groans]

14:18.774 --> 14:21.777
But, yeah, it's mostly just me.
Shall we head back to the village?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.821
I had something else in mind.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.364
Hmm?

14:25.447 --> 14:26.866
-[foosa growling]
-[whimpering]

14:31.579 --> 14:34.957
Oh! Looks like they're having
some sort of dinner party. Ha!

14:35.040 --> 14:37.918
-I seem to have misplaced my invitation.
-[cracks knuckles]

14:38.002 --> 14:40.671
Oh, wait, here it is.
And what do we have here?

14:40.754 --> 14:42.214
I've got a plus-one.

with your mouth full...

14:54.810 --> 14:56.437

14:56.520 --> 14:58.105
-Hee-yah!

15:03.319 --> 15:06.322

Look around the village. What do you see?

Besides trees, rocks, puddles,

-some bugs flying around, air molecules...

than it normally is.

And I'll give you one guess
who's behind it.

-Is it Koto?
-Yeah, right, Maurice.

You know that's my
non-self-actualized name.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.953
I am Sage Moondancer or...

[screaming unintelligibly]

17:21.040 --> 17:21.915
for short.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.792
And, yeah, I think you're behind this.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.085
Wasn't Clover with you?

17:25.169 --> 17:28.005
Oh! Oh... [giggles]

17:28.088 --> 17:30.132
What is this really about, brother?

17:30.215 --> 17:32.092
Surely, you're not still jealous of me.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.093
Crimson?

17:33.177 --> 17:34.053
Clover.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.514
No, Clover's on a "date" with Koto.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.932
That's where I just was.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.976
Okay, then where's Crimson?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.686
-I don't know.
-Crimson's missing?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.938
-Isn't anyone worried about her?
-No.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.484
Oh, okay. What would I have
to be jealous of you for, Koto?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.527
You're jealous that I had the courage

17:50.611 --> 17:53.197
to stay and fight
instead of running and hiding.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.240
And now, our kingdom is gone.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.877
Oh, um...

20:53.961 --> 20:57.130
King Julien needs me here,
protecting the kingdom.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.259
Why don't you stay?
Well, if your kingdom is gone,

21:00.342 --> 21:02.761
you don't have anywhere else to be, right?

21:02.844 --> 21:07.266
I should get this serpent safely away
from the village before it wakes up.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.394
I will return for you some day. I promise.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.730
-[giggles] Mmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.441
[sniffs] Hmm.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.819
The Moondancer is watching you, brother.

21:18.902 --> 21:22.489
Watching you like a bird that is known
for watching things.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.866
Closely. But from a distance.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.285
Hey, buddy,

21:26.368 --> 21:29.913
if you ever need a place to stay
or a trampoline to jump on

21:29.997 --> 21:33.292
or a tub to hot in,
you are always welcome here.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.585
I am forever in your debt.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.380

21:38.588 --> 21:40.465
[eagle squawking]

21:44.720 --> 21:45.679
Wow!

21:45.887 --> 21:49.391
Think what would have happened
if I hadn't saved that guy's life.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.392
[laughs]

21:50.851 --> 21:54.354
I feel real good about that.
Real good. [grunts]

21:54.438 --> 21:56.189
[drums beating]

22:03.238 --> 22:04.573

-[clanging]

22:04.656 --> 22:06.158
[eagle squawking]

22:11.079 --> 22:15.000
I tracked your snake
all the way across the island, Benson.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.587
Pet ownership is a huge responsibility.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.630
You must take it more seriously.

22:20.922 --> 22:21.798
[growls]

22:24.051 --> 22:26.261
I have found our next conquest.

22:26.344 --> 22:29.598
Their land is lush and full of resources.

22:29.681 --> 22:33.560
And their king is a harmless buffoon.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.896
We will crush them like beetles underfoot!
