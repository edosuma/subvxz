14:02.942 --> 14:04.743
And that's it?
We just sit here and wait?

14:04.810 --> 14:06.512
What else can we do?

14:09.048 --> 14:11.450
I've got an idea.
Get typing, Dad.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.320
And you thought
we left it all behind.

14:14.386 --> 14:19.625
We're going to have such fun.
You and me,
travelling the world!

14:19.692 --> 14:24.029
The Langer boys in a yacht!
It's gonna be...

14:29.068 --> 14:30.536
It's gonna be cool.

14:41.914 --> 14:42.848
We're here.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.388
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

14:49.455 --> 14:52.558
They've stopped moving.
You need to turn left here.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.461
The Marina?
He wants to take him away!

14:55.527 --> 14:58.597
He's wants to take my baby.
I don't think so!

15:05.471 --> 15:09.441
Look at it.
There's nothing stopping us.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.344
We can go anywhere out there!

15:12.411 --> 15:13.412
(GROANING)

15:14.513 --> 15:16.582
Dad!

15:16.649 --> 15:20.753
Dad! Dad?
What's happening to you?

15:23.622 --> 15:27.092
We just need a boat.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.862
(SCREAMING)

15:29.928 --> 15:31.864
Clyde! Help me!

15:33.265 --> 15:36.468
Help! Someone help me, please!

15:36.535 --> 15:37.636
Please help my dad.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.913
It's okay, Dad,
someone's coming.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.849
You two stay here.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.188
She's going to
see the pendant.
She's going to see everything!

15:56.255 --> 15:58.724
Clyde! Clyde!

15:58.791 --> 16:02.094
Please! Please help us!
My dad is ill and...

16:04.730 --> 16:07.766
What are you doing?
Get off me, you!
Who are you?

16:07.833 --> 16:11.170
Clyde, that's not funny.
Seriously, don't mess about,
not now.

16:11.236 --> 16:15.074
How do you know my name?
How does everyone
know my name?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.109
You've got to help my dad,
he's all I've got.

16:17.176 --> 16:22.648
It's me, it's Mum.
What have you
done to him, Paul?

16:22.715 --> 16:25.617
I knew you were trouble,
but I never knew
you could be such a...

16:31.590 --> 16:32.691
Monster.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.928
He's not a monster. Dad?

16:37.863 --> 16:41.834
-Please will you help us?
-(DISTORTED)
What's happening to me?

16:41.900 --> 16:43.369
Mr Langer, it's the pendant.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.605
Every time you use it,
it overpowers you.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.708
Clyde, get back!
It's not safe.

16:49.775 --> 16:53.979
He's my soldier
and you can't stop us,
'cause if you do,

16:54.646 --> 16:56.315
if you try to,

16:56.382 --> 17:00.285
I'll tell you to
walk into the water.
I'll destroy you all.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.621
(LAUGHING)

17:02.688 --> 17:07.526
This whole world
will do as I say!

17:07.593 --> 17:09.461
Dad, please.

17:09.528 --> 17:14.433
I am the Berserker
and you will follow my orders.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.934
SARAH JANE:
Oh, I don't think so.

17:21.507 --> 17:22.808
CLYDE: Sarah Jane!

17:23.409 --> 17:24.910
(SNARLING)

17:24.977 --> 17:27.045
I don't understand
what's happening.

17:27.112 --> 17:30.149
These people reckon
I should know them,
but I don't.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.051
Who are they?

17:33.118 --> 17:35.821
They are the most
important people
in your life.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.791
Okay, Clyde,
I need you to trust me.

17:38.857 --> 17:42.561
You and me,
we're going to
sort all this out,

17:42.628 --> 17:45.564
and now we're going to put
your dad right
before it's too late.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.865
Now, come on.

17:49.067 --> 17:52.871
Paul, now listen to me.
You love your son, yes?

17:54.573 --> 17:59.478
The war.
I need him for the war.

18:01.313 --> 18:04.983
He's my soldier and he's going
to be just like me.

18:05.050 --> 18:08.787
Dad, no, turn yourself back.
Tell yourself to
be human again.

18:08.854 --> 18:14.827
I am better like this.
I'm not useless
or cool or scared.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.863
I'm a soldier.
I'm a Berserker!

18:19.331 --> 18:21.767
I could get the pendant,
put things right.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.635
No. I'm not going to let
that happen to you.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.772
What then? I can't lose him.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.876
Look at him. Deep down,
he needs to know
who he really is.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.849
Clyde, be careful.

18:39.117 --> 18:43.622
Dad,
remember the park in Hounslow
where you used to take me?

18:43.689 --> 18:44.857
Just think back to that.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.997
(GROWLING)

18:52.064 --> 18:54.766
Be careful, Clyde.

18:54.833 --> 18:58.737
Remember,
<i>"Ich heisse</i> Clyde Langer."

19:05.477 --> 19:07.846
Remember how you felt
when you first met me.

19:11.717 --> 19:12.851
Remember how you
came back for me?

19:20.492 --> 19:21.994
I remember.

19:22.060 --> 19:27.165
Look at the mirror,
look at your reflection.
That isn't you.

19:27.232 --> 19:30.869
Just remember what you are,
remember before the pendant,

19:30.936 --> 19:34.506
no Berserkers,
no mind control.

19:34.573 --> 19:37.876
That's not you, Paul.
You need to remember
who you are.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.389
(GROANING)

20:08.540 --> 20:11.877
That's it. You're human.
Just like the rest of us.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.384
(GRUNTING)

20:24.856 --> 20:26.091
Where's the car gone?

20:28.727 --> 20:29.695
Ah!

20:34.900 --> 20:35.867
Clyde?

20:39.771 --> 20:41.573
You're not gonna cry, are you?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.142
You all right, Rani?

20:45.978 --> 20:48.847
-Hi, Mum.
-Oh, my darling!

20:53.552 --> 20:54.853
CLYDE: I love you, Mum.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.426
Dad?

21:08.867 --> 21:12.571
Come on, back to the car.
They need to talk.

21:12.638 --> 21:15.507
-How did you know
where to find us?
-We tried calling you.

21:15.574 --> 21:19.211
Alan searched the NHS database
and found out which
hospital I was in,

21:19.277 --> 21:20.912
and he managed to
get a message to me.

21:20.979 --> 21:23.248
I've got some
very clever friends.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.517
-What about this?
-You know what to do.

21:29.388 --> 21:32.858
I've got it, haven't I?
I've got my family back.

21:35.093 --> 21:40.032
The three of us,
back together.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.668
-Mum, Dad and me.
-It doesn't work though.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.371
You can't make us be together.

21:46.438 --> 21:50.042
I could. I could use this
to make you love
each other again.

21:50.108 --> 21:53.912
And history
would repeat itself.
We'd fall out. We'd argue.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.516
We'd be unhappy,
then I'd leave.
Walk away.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.851
I could stop you.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.688
You could. Yeah.

22:03.355 --> 22:04.856
It wouldn't be real.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.661
I'm going back to the car.
Are you coming?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.931
I want to say
bye to Dad first.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.073
I'm sorry.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.850
-Mel's pregnant.
-What?

22:33.151 --> 22:34.453
That's why I ran away.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.857
I remembered
what a useless dad
I was to you.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.927
-But I needed you!
-(SCOFFS)

22:41.993 --> 22:44.596
You're not a kid any more.
You're cool.

22:45.731 --> 22:47.532
You don't need me.

22:49.634 --> 22:50.736
You're right.

22:52.137 --> 22:52.938
I don't need you.

22:54.740 --> 22:58.810
I've got Mum, Sarah Jane,
Luke, Rani, Maria.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.583
So I don't need you.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.820
But I think that baby does.

23:10.188 --> 23:11.857
Try not to mess it up.

23:26.905 --> 23:31.109
And you can take the car back,
the clothes, everything.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.781
I'll go home with Mum.

23:58.570 --> 24:02.407
So, what was that all about?

24:02.474 --> 24:06.077
It's just,
you know, what I do.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.981
It's dangerous.
I've tried so hard
to keep you safe.

24:11.516 --> 24:15.220
Clyde, I can't cope with this.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.690
And I want to keep you safe.
I want you to be happy.

24:20.258 --> 24:24.029
Mum, forget about the pendant.

24:24.095 --> 24:27.632
Forget about the aliens
and forget about what I do.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.509
Flip, it's cold.
Where's your dad?

24:37.576 --> 24:38.910
Dad's gone.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.314
I'm sorry, Clyde.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.850
Yeah, me, too. Let's go home.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.510
Knock, knock.

25:13.478 --> 25:14.813
Come in, Clyde.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.890
-I came to say I'm...
-I know.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.827
I shouldn't have
brought him here.

25:28.894 --> 25:31.796
You wanted to
impress your dad.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.865
I'd probably
have done the same.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.670
Do you miss your mum and dad?

25:38.737 --> 25:42.107
I can't really remember them.
I was a baby when they died.

25:43.675 --> 25:46.745
Yes, sometimes.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.447
I'd do anything
just to see them again.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.818
Go on.
Tell me what you're thinking.

25:53.885 --> 25:58.890
Well, sometimes...
Sometimes people think
I'm not bothered by stuff.

26:00.692 --> 26:01.927
That I'm always...

26:04.829 --> 26:09.000
Clyde, you don't have to
be cool all the time.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.870
There's a lot of my dad in me.
I saw that today.

26:13.905 --> 26:19.077
And I think... I think
if it wasn't for you lot,
I'd be weaker.

26:20.946 --> 26:21.947
Like him.

26:23.715 --> 26:26.151
And I think you
underestimate yourself.

26:28.586 --> 26:31.056
Now, go on. Get home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:40.665 --> 26:41.666
Thank you.

27:12.597 --> 27:19.004

<i>She will return here,</i>

27:23.708 --> 27:25.844
<i>that she cannot resist.</i>

27:25.910 --> 27:30.715
