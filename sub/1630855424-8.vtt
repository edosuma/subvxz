WEBVTT

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
I thought you hated weddings.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.372
I do, but I wasn't
going to miss this one.

04:49.456 --> 04:53.001
Maybe we'll finally see these
two tongs come together.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.961
I don't think
that's what we're seeing.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.465
I, Walter Franklin Buckley,
do solemnly swear

04:58.548 --> 05:01.593
to perform the duties
as mayor of San Francisco

05:01.676 --> 05:06.056
to the best of my ability,
so help me God.

05:16.775 --> 05:20.362
It is not enough to complain
about the barbarians

05:20.445 --> 05:24.157
at the gates of our great city,
wringing our hands

05:24.240 --> 05:27.369
as we wait for the state
or nation to intervene.

05:51.267 --> 05:56.022
The defense of our city
and our way of life falls to us.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.441
It is the fighting spirit
of Americans

05:58.525 --> 06:02.654
that led to the birth
of our great nation.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.657
We must preserve that spirit

06:05.740 --> 06:08.451
and not allow
the insidious insurgents

06:08.535 --> 06:11.621
of a devious alien race

06:11.705 --> 06:15.333
to come between us
and our destiny.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.506
With your continued support,

06:21.589 --> 06:25.802
we will cleanse every trace
of this rot and infection

06:25.885 --> 06:29.180
from our streets, our ports,

06:29.264 --> 06:31.224
our factories, and our fields.

06:31.307 --> 06:35.437
And our shining golden city
will light the way forward,

06:35.520 --> 06:37.647
not just for California,

06:37.731 --> 06:41.568
but for the entire
United States.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.490
Jesus.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.949
He thinks
he just became president.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.118
The day a politician
steps into office

07:32.202 --> 07:33.828
is the day he starts looking
for a bigger one.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.791
Maybe "Governor" Buckley
would be a useful ally someday.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.084
I'll wait to see
if Mayor Buckley

07:39.167 --> 07:41.044
can do half of what he says.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.421
Or what he's told.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.590
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.343
He got his votes.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.636
Time to earn them.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.805
You don't mean
the Donahue boys?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.723
- Yeah.
- Wait.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.350
Look around.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.976
This is not the time.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.812
This is the only time.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.522
They're up in front
of the judge tomorrow.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.065
Unless you want to pull
that string yourself.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.901
I have a long list of items
for our new mayor,

08:04.984 --> 08:08.279
and pardoning a couple
of hooligans is not on it.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.199
I can't believe the going rate
for chief of police

08:11.282 --> 08:12.826
is all that high.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.286
Atwood's not for sale.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.996
Well, if not the purse,
then the sword.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.665
Either way,
there's no need to squander

08:18.748 --> 08:20.709
your political capital,
or mine.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.128
I won't be of much use to you
if I'm locked up for assault.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.923
Just about every cop in that
police station is Irish.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.633
If you can't figure out
a way to keep yourself

08:28.717 --> 08:31.678
and a couple of Mick boys
out of jail,

08:31.761 --> 08:33.888
I wonder what use
you're gonna be to anyone.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.083
Drinks, music,

09:02.167 --> 09:04.002
a whole spread.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.213
The Long Zii know
how to throw a party.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.424
I'll give 'em that.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.092
Can't be cheap.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.762
Maybe we've been looking
in the wrong direction.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.431
What is it?

09:17.974 --> 09:20.226
Long Zii and Hop Wei
at a party together.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.896
Is that not par
for the course?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.523
Not without a lot more blood.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.403
Um...

09:41.331 --> 09:43.875
I hear we're training
new printers.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.710
Come on, man.
It's a party.

09:45.794 --> 09:46.628
Yeah.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.465
Isn't that right? Yeah.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.633
Yeah, it is.

09:56.554 --> 10:00.809
So you worried
about the Long Zii?

10:00.892 --> 10:02.811
Seems like things
are going well.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.606
Give me a minute, all right?

10:06.690 --> 10:07.857
Boss stuff.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.983
Don't go too far.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.953
I'm covering our asses.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.831
This whole operation
depends on one girl

10:22.914 --> 10:25.458
who does everything

10:25.542 --> 10:27.502
and knows everything.

10:28.670 --> 10:32.924
Yeah, backup's good,
but Yan Mi is solid.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.135
She won't be a problem.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.847
I'm not willing
to bet the tong on that.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.056
Are you?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.314
Look, I know you like her.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.983
Get all the sticky you want.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.070
All I'm saying is,
just don't get attached.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.488
Get me?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.242
I get you.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.453
And speaking of sticky...

11:05.790 --> 11:08.043
Excuse me.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.712
Li Yong, may the elders
have a word with you?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.923
I'll be back.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.258
Okay.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.521
There are few things as
beautiful as a woman in love,

11:28.605 --> 11:30.940
especially on her wedding day.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.944
I mean, once you look past
all the naked ambition

11:35.028 --> 11:37.864
and, you know, murder.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.533
You're getting sentimental
in your old age.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.160
I have seen
the smartest people

11:42.243 --> 11:44.746
do the stupidest things
chasing love.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.833
That has to mean something.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.964
Well, maybe they're chasing
something that isn't real.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.426
Just because something's rare
doesn't mean it isn't real.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.641
Just means it costs.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.115
Thank you, brother.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.584
We welcome this new chapter
for the Long Zii and for you.

12:31.668 --> 12:35.005
You have always been
the voice of reason for the tong.

12:35.088 --> 12:39.551
We trust you will now use
that voice to help manage

12:39.634 --> 12:43.722
Mai Ling's
more reckless impulses.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.729
There is only one voice
for the Long Zii.

12:50.812 --> 12:51.980
You see?

12:52.063 --> 12:54.357
He's too blind
to see the danger.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.861
You are her husband now,
and a leader of this tong.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.865
Wu Jin, please,
may I speak with Li Yong alone?

13:32.937 --> 13:33.855
What?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.148
Nothing.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.526
You seem happy.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.778
I am.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.031
You know, not long ago,
we were at war.

13:43.114 --> 13:46.493
You and Li Yong were trying
to kill each other,

13:46.576 --> 13:48.119
but tonight, we're family.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.746
There's always tomorrow.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.335
You know,
this could be a new beginning

13:55.418 --> 13:58.380
for the tongs, for Chinatown.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.091
Isn't that what you want?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.009
Don't you think
we've earned it?

14:04.094 --> 14:06.096
Tell Li Yong...

14:08.306 --> 14:10.308
I said congratulations.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.401
I won't go behind her back.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.027
No one's asking for that.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.196
I have great respect
for Mai Ling,

14:23.279 --> 14:25.323
but left unchecked,

14:25.407 --> 14:29.911
her ambition could become
a liability for all of us,

14:29.994 --> 14:31.830
even you.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.832
You're wrong about her.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.208
Am I?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.586
How did Long Zii die?

14:43.133 --> 14:46.428
The elders have
run out of patience.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.014
They're ready to fight
for control of the tong,

14:49.097 --> 14:50.974
but it doesn't have
to come to that.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.644
They will listen to you
if you will listen to them.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.523
We're only thinking
of what's best for the tong,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.525
including Mai Ling.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.781
She would be touched
by your concern.

15:06.865 --> 15:10.118
Li Yong,
I'm on your side here.

15:13.788 --> 15:16.041
I have to go back to my wife.

15:34.976 --> 15:38.396
What was that about?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.191
The elders wanted
to pay their respects.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.714
Agent Lee.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.594
Thought your problem fixed.

16:09.678 --> 16:10.595
So did I.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.222
Turns out we were both wrong.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.140
Is there a cousin
you forget to kill?

16:16.101 --> 16:19.062
The Hop Wei celebrating
with the Long Zii.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.439
I'm just wondering what could
bring them together like this.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.525
Wedding, Agent Lee.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.319
Chinese people get married too,
you know.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.988
Well, I'm guessing
it's something more profitable,

16:29.072 --> 16:31.783
and if the tongs are working
together, printing money,

16:31.866 --> 16:33.993
let's say,
it stands to reason that

16:34.077 --> 16:36.830
they'd need a neutral party
to broker that deal.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.750
If so, then yes.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.419
Chao.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.296
Come on.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.174
We can help each other here.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.428
We already help each other.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.347
I'm gonna close this case,
Chao,

16:54.431 --> 16:56.433
and if you're still involved
when I do,

16:56.516 --> 16:57.684
I'll take you down as well.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.728
I won't feel good about it,
but I'll do it.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.772
Not feel good, huh?

17:02.856 --> 17:05.525
You are strange man,
Agent Lee.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.029
Sometime break law.
Sometime follow law.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.156
Sometime save life.

17:11.239 --> 17:14.075
Sometime take life.

17:14.159 --> 17:17.996
But Chao know
what you come from.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.751
Maybe you not feel good
because you confused.

17:22.834 --> 17:27.380
Maybe you feel better
without badge on your chest.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.844
If you change your mind,

17:32.927 --> 17:34.721
you know where to find me.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.725
Otherwise, I'd advise you
to steer clear of tong business.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.979
Good advice for anyone.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.104
Hey.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.456
I don't give a shit
what Mai Ling says.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.750
I'm taking back my property,

19:26.833 --> 19:29.502
and I figure you owe me
interest.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.087
What's the going rate now

19:31.171 --> 19:32.839
for the great Ah Toy's
legendary pussy--

19:43.058 --> 19:44.392
Fuck!

19:44.476 --> 19:46.394
You bit off my fucking nose!

19:55.403 --> 19:57.655
Whoa. You okay?

20:00.533 --> 20:03.036
I hate weddings.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.625
His name is Marcel.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.959
What?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.586
Does he think he's Spanish
or something?

20:11.670 --> 20:14.130
It's French, I think.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.216
A Chinese guy named Marcel.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.051
Boss.

20:21.596 --> 20:26.309
Dad, what are you doing
out here?

20:26.393 --> 20:27.936
Enjoying the night air.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.562
In your pajamas?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.816
- Hong?
- Yes, sir?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.901
Shut up and go inside.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.403
Yes, sir.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.616
Sit with me.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.923
May I?

21:07.183 --> 21:09.394
So why are you out here?

21:19.112 --> 21:24.325
I feel like I keep waking up
over and over.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.827
From one dream into the next,

21:25.910 --> 21:27.912
and I can never remember
any of them.

21:29.164 --> 21:34.711
I try, but it's all...sand.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.673
But tonight,
when I woke up out here,

21:38.757 --> 21:42.385
I felt like myself for the first time
since we got back,

21:42.469 --> 21:44.679
and I keep thinking,
if I get up,

21:44.763 --> 21:47.223
it's all gonna
slip away again.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.559
It's just the fever.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.560
It'll pass.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.902
Your mother hated
when I smoked.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.237
If I smelled like smoke
when I saw her,

22:01.321 --> 22:03.698
she'd get pissed,
jaw would stick out.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.784
Her eyes would turn black.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.039
I'm out here with no pants,

22:11.122 --> 22:13.208
but that, I remember.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.294
Hey.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.256
You're going to be okay.

22:20.924 --> 22:24.260
When you've scrapped
as much as I have,

22:24.344 --> 22:26.721
you know when
you're losing the fight.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.067
Where you coming from?

22:43.446 --> 22:45.031
Mai Ling's wedding.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.660
So she finally decided
to marry Li Yong.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.161
Yeah.

22:52.455 --> 22:55.500
Let's see how long he lasts.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.460
He'll be fine.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.713
He's a follower,

22:59.796 --> 23:03.216
unlike Mai Ling
and her brother.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.845
Ah Sahm's not like her.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.681
His intentions may be different,
but in the end,

23:09.764 --> 23:12.100
a man like that
will never accept being led.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.102
So he'll always be a threat.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.438
He's been fucked up lately.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.484
But he would never
challenge me for the tong.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.654
That's what I said about you.

23:30.744 --> 23:33.163
Come on.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.998
It's cold out here.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.669
Just a little bit longer.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.592
Okay, Dad.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.634
Horace.
What's going on?

26:32.717 --> 26:34.135
Hey, Bill.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.349
Thought I'd start you
in accounting today.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.558
How's that sound?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.060
Thought I had
to work my way up.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.187
My wife thought otherwise.

26:45.897 --> 26:48.149
You ever reconciled a ledger?

26:48.233 --> 26:49.693
Don't think so.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.404
The important part is
keeping track of who we owe

26:52.487 --> 26:53.905
and who owes us.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.533
I'm sure you're familiar
with that concept.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.911
Amos over here
will help you out.

27:02.038 --> 27:05.625
As long as you can do
basic math,

27:05.709 --> 27:07.502
you should be fine.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.922
Current month goes here,
invoicing here, received here.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.717
Any discrepancies go there.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.968
And "discrepancy" means
the difference--

27:15.051 --> 27:16.678
I know what it means.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.304
Sure.

27:18.388 --> 27:20.932
Now, these codes correspond

27:21.016 --> 27:23.435
to all the vendors
we use regularly.

27:23.518 --> 27:24.894
If it doesn't come up
on that list,

27:24.978 --> 27:26.479
I want you to write it down
at the bottom,

27:26.563 --> 27:28.982
bring it to me
at the end of the day.

27:29.065 --> 27:31.985
If you any questions, ask.

27:37.741 --> 27:39.159
Wait.

27:39.242 --> 27:40.785
That'll be all.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.255
Out of my way.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.965
Mai Ling!

27:56.009 --> 27:57.052
Kong Pak, what is this?

27:57.135 --> 27:59.512
Wu Jin and the other elders
are dead.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.431
I barely survived!

28:03.266 --> 28:05.769
I offered you friendship
and a seat at the table,

28:05.852 --> 28:07.729
and you betrayed me.

28:07.812 --> 28:10.148
You tried to turn
my own husband against me.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.610
Li Yong, open your eyes.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.988
If you won't stop her,
get out of the way,

28:17.072 --> 28:18.698
and I will.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.626
After everything she's done,

28:29.709 --> 28:31.670
you are still willing
to die for her.

29:05.662 --> 29:07.622
Begin.

30:57.232 --> 30:59.651
Please stop.

31:04.614 --> 31:06.366
I warned you.

31:06.449 --> 31:08.034
She'll never stop.

31:09.369 --> 31:13.331
So I can't either.

32:11.556 --> 32:13.850
They would have destroyed us.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.979
You know that.

32:21.441 --> 32:24.652
I made the choice so that
you wouldn't have to.

32:26.863 --> 32:28.740
I did it for us.

32:30.825 --> 32:33.745
Leave me alone.

32:36.414 --> 32:39.542
But we're free now, Li Yong.

32:40.919 --> 32:43.838
Go!

33:14.661 --> 33:17.247
You're not telling me
something.

33:17.330 --> 33:19.124
They were busted for robbery.

33:19.207 --> 33:22.127
You went in, and now
they're set to stand for assault!

33:22.210 --> 33:23.253
Calm yourself, Killy.

33:23.336 --> 33:26.798
That judge is gonna give them
five years tomorrow

33:26.881 --> 33:29.009
for stealing food.

33:29.634 --> 33:30.719
What did you do?

33:30.802 --> 33:32.345
I promise you.
I did what I could.

33:32.429 --> 33:34.097
You promise?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.682
Jesus.

33:35.765 --> 33:38.852
You're a proper fucking
fat cat now, aren't you?

33:38.935 --> 33:41.896
I'm a man who knows how
to fight his own fucking battles.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.482
- You should try it sometime.
- Oh.

33:44.566 --> 33:48.278
All these years,
we trusted you.

33:48.361 --> 33:50.405
You were just stepping
on our backs,

33:50.488 --> 33:52.282
trying to get a leg up.

33:53.992 --> 33:57.871
Christ, Dylan,
our boys used to play together.

33:57.954 --> 34:00.373
It could have been
your sons in there--

34:09.174 --> 34:11.467
Go home.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.802
Sleep it off.

34:17.891 --> 34:22.020
You've forgotten yourself,
Dylan,

34:22.103 --> 34:24.731
forgotten who you are.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.716
My boys wouldn't
have been stupid enough

34:51.800 --> 34:53.551
to get fucking pinched.

34:57.347 --> 34:58.932
You okay?

35:04.104 --> 35:06.398
Dan would have been 16
next week.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.569
No, 17.

35:11.653 --> 35:13.738
Fuck me. 17.

35:22.122 --> 35:24.916
You picked a hell of a time
to stop being a cop.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.585
I need you in there.

35:27.669 --> 35:30.005
Doesn't matter.
Atwood doesn't listen to me.

35:30.088 --> 35:31.923
Those are your men
at the station.

35:32.007 --> 35:34.175
- Not anymore.
- Bullshit.

35:34.259 --> 35:36.219
They followed your orders
for 10 fucking years.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.221
You're telling me
you got no sway with them?

35:38.304 --> 35:40.306
Those are men with families.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.017
If it comes down
to me or their jobs,

35:42.100 --> 35:43.184
what do you think they'll pick?

35:47.313 --> 35:48.857
Well, I guess we're both
no fucking good to anyone then,

35:48.940 --> 35:50.108
are we?

36:05.331 --> 36:06.624
Fuck it.

36:08.251 --> 36:09.461
Let's go.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.049
What are they gonna do,
fire me?

36:22.140 --> 36:25.727
Bill, you can't.

36:25.810 --> 36:28.188
None of us like what's
going on with those lads,

36:28.271 --> 36:29.606
but Chief Atwood, he's--

36:29.689 --> 36:31.316
Atwood is
a sanctimonious prick,

36:31.399 --> 36:32.984
and he's cleaning house.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.444
I may have been
the first to go,

36:34.527 --> 36:36.071
but I sure as hell
won't be the last.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.450
He thinks so much of you lot,

36:40.533 --> 36:42.535
you're working a shift
reserved for rookies.

36:45.288 --> 36:49.125
So just how long
do you think you've got?

36:49.209 --> 36:51.586
A lot less
if I let those boys go.

36:59.552 --> 37:00.845
Sorry, Bill.

37:02.138 --> 37:03.765
I can't.

37:05.558 --> 37:08.353
Well, maybe I wasn't clear.

37:08.436 --> 37:10.647
I'm not fucking asking.

37:16.653 --> 37:18.113
Just make it quick.

37:25.620 --> 37:27.455
Time to go, lads.

37:27.539 --> 37:29.374
No one's going anywhere.

37:36.214 --> 37:39.300
I always knew you weren't
much of a cop, O'Hara.

37:39.384 --> 37:41.594
Harrison, put the prisoners
back in their cell

37:41.678 --> 37:43.972
and lock the door,
and then cuff these two

37:44.055 --> 37:46.766
and bring them up
for processing.

37:50.603 --> 37:52.105
Sorry, Chief.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.233
Left my cuffs upstairs.

37:57.736 --> 37:59.654
These boys don't belong here.

37:59.738 --> 38:02.240
We're paying their fines,
and we're bringing them home.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.325
We?

38:04.409 --> 38:06.661
It didn't take you long
to find your level,

38:06.745 --> 38:09.080
now did it, Irishman?

38:09.164 --> 38:13.585
I hear you're fond
of a wager, O'Hara.

38:14.794 --> 38:16.588
So here it is.

38:16.671 --> 38:20.925
You knock me down,
the Donahue boys are free to go.

38:21.009 --> 38:24.220
Otherwise,
the two of you join them.

38:30.518 --> 38:32.062
Look.

38:32.145 --> 38:35.231
If you think I'm stupid enough
to fight the chief of police--

38:42.322 --> 38:44.199
Get him, Bill.

38:46.701 --> 38:48.036
Come on, Bill!

38:48.119 --> 38:49.245
Come on.

39:04.678 --> 39:05.595
Come on!

39:11.559 --> 39:12.852
Yes!

39:12.936 --> 39:15.397
Take him out. Take him.

39:24.447 --> 39:27.575
Keep your fucking
hands up, Bill.

39:27.659 --> 39:28.618
That's it, Bill.

39:28.702 --> 39:30.578
I said keep your
fucking hands up!

39:35.959 --> 39:37.335
Come on, Bill!

39:40.380 --> 39:43.675
For fuck's sake, stop fucking
around and hit him, Bill!

39:45.885 --> 39:46.720
Yes!

40:01.693 --> 40:03.486
- Come on!
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

40:08.366 --> 40:11.036
Come on, Big Bill.

40:11.119 --> 40:14.456
Where's that
fighting Irish spirit?

40:14.539 --> 40:16.875
Oh, for fuck's sake.

40:16.958 --> 40:19.085
- Yeah!
- Come on!

40:19.169 --> 40:20.337
Jesus!

40:20.420 --> 40:22.130
Come on, Bill.

40:22.213 --> 40:23.923
Settle in, Bill.

40:28.219 --> 40:30.430
- Take him to the dump!
- Come on.

40:30.513 --> 40:34.059
This cell is gonna be
your new home.

40:34.142 --> 40:36.519
Please stop.

40:36.603 --> 40:38.104
Stop!

40:38.188 --> 40:40.982
What was that?

40:41.066 --> 40:42.359
You had enough?

40:42.442 --> 40:44.944
Please stop talking.

40:59.668 --> 41:00.919
Yes, Bill!

41:02.128 --> 41:03.129
Yes!

41:04.547 --> 41:06.383
Get on your fucking feet.

41:09.511 --> 41:11.721
I said get up!

41:13.264 --> 41:14.599
Knock that pig out back,
come on!

41:14.683 --> 41:16.101
- Yes, Bill!
- Get him!

41:21.981 --> 41:25.610
I may not be much of a cop...

41:25.694 --> 41:28.363
but you're no fucking chief.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.415
Bill. Bill!

41:38.498 --> 41:40.041
We need to get you to a doctor.

41:40.125 --> 41:43.294
Nah, best I've felt in years.

41:43.378 --> 41:45.338
Oh, fuck.

41:48.091 --> 41:50.218
Now, that's an Irishman.

42:04.941 --> 42:06.776
Stay.

42:10.739 --> 42:12.574
I've got to go.

42:16.619 --> 42:17.787
What?

42:18.997 --> 42:21.124
What is it?

42:21.207 --> 42:24.169
Young Jun's getting nervous
about the operation.

42:25.628 --> 42:27.380
You mean me.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.133
Yeah.

42:31.468 --> 42:33.303
He's looking to close ranks.

42:35.263 --> 42:37.640
How much time do I have?

42:41.895 --> 42:43.855
He still needs you to print.

42:43.938 --> 42:45.774
The new guys aren't ready yet.

42:50.487 --> 42:52.405
But once they are...

42:59.287 --> 43:01.498
Maybe you should think about
taking that train.

43:17.180 --> 43:18.807
Fucking hell.

43:33.405 --> 43:36.074
Ah, fuck.

43:36.157 --> 43:37.742
Jesus.

43:37.826 --> 43:39.327
Bill.

43:39.411 --> 43:41.329
What in God's name happened?

43:53.758 --> 43:54.884
Bill.

43:56.803 --> 43:58.346
Answer me.

43:59.014 --> 44:00.515
What happened?

44:04.644 --> 44:05.937
Fight.

44:06.021 --> 44:07.856
I see that.
With who?

44:09.399 --> 44:10.775
Atwood.

44:12.110 --> 44:13.695
He had it coming.

44:32.964 --> 44:35.300
What was this about, then?

44:35.383 --> 44:37.677
Donahue boys.

44:37.761 --> 44:40.638
Did you get them out
at least?

44:40.722 --> 44:42.265
I did.

44:43.641 --> 44:45.477
They didn't arrest you?

44:46.311 --> 44:47.729
They will.

44:51.691 --> 44:53.026
Another one?

44:53.109 --> 44:54.611
Yes.

45:21.930 --> 45:24.057
I'll make sure
he makes it back.

45:29.771 --> 45:32.107
What do I do now, Chao?

45:51.960 --> 45:54.087
Kong Pak was right.

45:56.715 --> 45:58.341
I didn't want to listen.

46:03.013 --> 46:04.597
And now he's gone.

46:06.725 --> 46:08.560
The elders are gone.

46:12.313 --> 46:14.107
There's only Mai Ling.

46:15.483 --> 46:17.193
No. There's you.

46:19.654 --> 46:21.781
Mai Ling has always done
whatever she has to

46:21.865 --> 46:25.535
to protect herself,
including marrying you.

46:31.374 --> 46:33.668
Hey, I'm not saying
she doesn't love you.

46:35.587 --> 46:40.508
But I am saying
she can't do this without you.

47:31.601 --> 47:32.977
Get up.

47:34.771 --> 47:36.106
- Dad--
- Quiet.

47:37.107 --> 47:38.858
You're gonna take me
to my men,

47:38.942 --> 47:40.694
and we're all gonna get
out of here.

47:40.777 --> 47:44.197
Dad, it's me, Young Jun.

47:44.280 --> 47:45.240
Shut up!

47:47.909 --> 47:49.202
Get on your feet.

47:49.994 --> 47:52.706
Dad, Dad, Dad.

47:52.789 --> 47:54.582
Put the knife down.

47:55.208 --> 47:56.710
You're home.

47:56.793 --> 47:58.211
Yes.

48:03.425 --> 48:05.802
You're safe here, right?

48:10.473 --> 48:12.767
No, you're with them!

48:12.851 --> 48:14.227
You fucking traitor!

48:20.025 --> 48:22.485
Wake up!
Dad, wake up!

48:22.569 --> 48:24.904
You sold us out.
I'll fucking kill you!

48:34.247 --> 48:36.833
Dad. Dad.

48:36.916 --> 48:38.460
Dad, Dad. Dad, Dad.

48:38.543 --> 48:39.627
Dad. Dad.

48:39.711 --> 48:41.296
Dad! Dad.

48:41.379 --> 48:42.630
Dad!

48:44.716 --> 48:46.134
It's me.

48:46.217 --> 48:48.762
It's me, Young Jun.

48:52.390 --> 48:54.684
- Young Jun.
- Yes.

48:54.768 --> 48:56.978
You're here.
You're at home.

48:57.062 --> 48:58.688
You're at home, Dad.

49:04.110 --> 49:05.862
It's okay.
It's okay, Dad.

49:05.945 --> 49:08.198
It's okay, Dad.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

49:44.234 --> 49:46.027
Whoa.

49:48.988 --> 49:50.407
Good evening, sir.

49:50.490 --> 49:51.825
Brandy in the library.

49:51.908 --> 49:54.202
Very good, sir.

49:54.285 --> 49:58.498
Get me the plans for
the West Valley bridge project,

49:58.581 --> 50:02.210
and tell the cook to send me up
something in 15 minutes.

50:02.293 --> 50:03.586
Very good, sir.
