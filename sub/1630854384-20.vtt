Danni, you're talking
to your vagina.

06:40.126 --> 06:42.962
We talk all the time.
That's why I don't understand.

06:42.962 --> 06:45.798
[Sabrina] Clearly, there's a lot
of miscommunication happening.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.267
You think?

06:48.601 --> 06:50.270
I don't need a lecture, okay?

about all this.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.362
why you're doing this.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.033
Danni,
this is just like college,

07:20.033 --> 07:21.334
when you were rotating them.

07:21.334 --> 07:22.769
And?

07:23.369 --> 07:24.771
[Sabrina] Danni.

07:25.238 --> 07:27.507
Why? Why are you
doing this again?

07:27.507 --> 07:32.145
'Cause I want to, you know?
Because I'm single.

07:32.478 --> 07:36.015
I'm not married.
I'm not ready to be married.

07:36.316 --> 07:38.718
All right? I...

We're young. Life's short. FOMO.

Sabrina, I gotta go to work.
Okay?

08:01.107 --> 08:02.375
Can you just talk to Andi

and get this fixed
for Maurice now?

08:08.081 --> 08:10.383
Okay, but we're not done
talking about this.

I don't need
a damn intervention, Sabrina.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.842
That's not what I need.

08:35.842 --> 08:36.976
You're right.

08:36.976 --> 08:39.779
Think you need
a little bit more than that.

08:41.047 --> 08:42.849
Can you just go?

08:44.017 --> 08:45.918
You might wanna
change your sheets.

thinking about that.

Yeah.

11:11.241 --> 11:12.643
Robin...

11:14.311 --> 11:16.079
He said if I send
the money back today,

11:16.079 --> 11:17.748
he'll only charge me 10%.

11:20.217 --> 11:22.653
I told you he was was ruthless.

11:25.222 --> 11:27.457
Andi, I just gotta ask you,

11:29.059 --> 11:30.761
are you working with Gary?

11:31.962 --> 11:33.997
Why would you ask me that?

11:34.831 --> 11:36.400
He called him.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.635
Who's "he"?

11:40.304 --> 11:43.774
Your client said that Gary
told him he found out.

11:43.774 --> 11:46.877
He made him a better offer
if he rescinds the loan.

11:48.278 --> 11:49.713
Wow.

11:51.315 --> 11:55.719
So...that's why you think
that I told Gary.

11:55.719 --> 11:57.254
Don't get upset.
I'm just asking.

11:57.254 --> 11:59.423
No, I'm not upset. I just...

11:59.423 --> 12:02.092
I don't think that's something
you should be asking me.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.660
Why not, Andi?

12:04.595 --> 12:06.897
I mean, you were the one
who gave me the info,

12:06.897 --> 12:08.165
you gave me the help.

12:08.565 --> 12:11.668
Yeah, I gave you that help
so that I could help you.

12:11.668 --> 12:14.037
I gave you the information
so that I could help you.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.906
Why would you do that?

12:16.573 --> 12:19.042
Well, I wanted to help you
and I wanted you to...

12:22.379 --> 12:23.947
...help me.

12:24.648 --> 12:26.550
What does that mean?

12:27.517 --> 12:29.286
I'm up for partner.

12:29.987 --> 12:34.524
But if Gary and Hayden
move forward with this plan,

12:34.524 --> 12:37.361
then I lose my protection.

12:39.262 --> 12:41.431
So you told me to...

12:41.431 --> 12:43.000
Protect myself.

12:45.769 --> 12:47.537
You were the asshole, remember?

12:47.537 --> 12:48.972
[Robin] I know that.

12:48.972 --> 12:51.875
That's why I thought
you could be working against me.

12:54.177 --> 12:55.979
Then you don't know me
very well.

12:57.914 --> 12:59.383
Maybe I don't.

13:01.018 --> 13:02.619
I wouldn't do that.

13:02.886 --> 13:04.521
I just had to ask.

13:07.824 --> 13:08.959
-Okay.
-[Robin] All right, listen.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.827
This is what I'm thinking
about doing.

13:10.827 --> 13:12.362
-No, no, no.
-He'll be coming...

13:12.362 --> 13:14.865
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

13:15.332 --> 13:16.333
Why not?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.902
Because if whatever you do
doesn't work in your favor,

13:18.902 --> 13:20.804
you're gonna think
I told someone.

13:21.171 --> 13:22.673
Andi, we're good, okay.

13:22.673 --> 13:24.241
I don't believe
that you told Gary anything.

13:24.241 --> 13:25.308
I just had to make sure.

13:25.308 --> 13:27.077
Still, don't tell me.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.347
Okay.

13:30.347 --> 13:31.648
[Andi]<i> </i>Okay.

13:31.648 --> 13:34.851
I'm sorry about everything,

13:34.851 --> 13:36.987
but I'm gonna go
to my office, okay?

13:38.121 --> 13:39.356
Okay.

13:39.756 --> 13:42.426
I'm sorry if I upset you.

13:44.494 --> 13:45.996
It's fine.

13:47.798 --> 13:51.334
Hey, Andi, you're a lawyer.

13:51.334 --> 13:52.736
That was a fair question.

13:52.736 --> 13:54.905
You can't get this sensitive
about these things.

13:56.673 --> 13:58.709
I'm not being sensitive, Robin.

14:00.277 --> 14:03.280
What I am is
in an awkward position.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.383
You're my boss,
and I slept with you.

14:06.383 --> 14:09.019
So this
isn't sensitivity.

14:09.286 --> 14:11.054
This is being careful.

14:12.589 --> 14:14.591
-Okay.
-[Andi]<i> </i>And cautious.

14:17.094 --> 14:19.029
I get it.

14:19.029 --> 14:20.497
Good.

14:21.531 --> 14:24.868
I'm sorry I tried to help you.

14:25.736 --> 14:28.505
But whatever you want
to do next,

14:28.505 --> 14:30.741
you have to handle it
on your own.

14:32.676 --> 14:34.411
That's fair enough.

14:37.948 --> 14:49.893
[music]

15:04.141 --> 15:06.009
[knocking on door]

15:11.515 --> 15:13.183
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:16.653 --> 15:18.155
What's going on?

15:18.155 --> 15:19.289
Guess what.

15:19.723 --> 15:22.192
-What?
-We got the money.

15:22.692 --> 15:24.361
-He said yes.
-Yes, he said yes.

15:24.361 --> 15:27.164
He said yes. Oh, my God.

15:27.164 --> 15:28.865
That's great.

15:29.199 --> 15:30.600
I know.

15:31.735 --> 15:33.904
I'm glad he could help.

15:35.338 --> 15:36.973
You don't mean that.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.842
Of course I do.

15:40.911 --> 15:43.547
You don't look like you mean it.
You look mad.

15:44.481 --> 15:46.583
No, whatever gets Maurice out,

15:46.583 --> 15:49.586
I'm for it.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.822
Are you?

15:52.522 --> 15:55.492
-Are you sure? Really?
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:55.492 --> 15:57.093
-Are you happy?
-Yes, I'm happy.

15:58.562 --> 16:01.731
So are you gonna see him again?

16:02.432 --> 16:03.667
-Calvin.
-[Calvin]<i> </i>What?

16:03.667 --> 16:05.735
It's just a simple question.

16:09.005 --> 16:10.273
I will.

16:12.876 --> 16:14.344
So he's trying to buy you.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.413
He's just helping me out.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.615
Well, it seems that way to me.

16:19.449 --> 16:20.817
Really?

16:21.418 --> 16:23.220
You know it's not that way.

16:24.921 --> 16:26.189
Yeah, okay.

16:27.157 --> 16:28.725
Calvin.

16:30.493 --> 16:32.262
Come on, don't be like that.

16:36.666 --> 16:38.201
Thanks for helping.

16:38.501 --> 16:41.805
Um, when can we see him?

16:42.639 --> 16:44.941
Andi's working on everything
right now.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.576
Soon.

16:47.143 --> 16:48.945
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:50.814 --> 16:52.782
I need to talk to you about Que.

16:53.016 --> 16:56.119
Oh, shit. What'd he do now?

16:56.119 --> 17:00.090
I saw him.

17:00.957 --> 17:02.359
Where?

17:02.359 --> 17:04.261
That doesn't really matter.

17:05.061 --> 17:06.763
But we have to
do something about it.

17:06.763 --> 17:08.632
[Calvin] You damn right
we gotta do something.

17:09.065 --> 17:10.967
[cellphone vibrating]
We have to do something.

17:13.103 --> 17:14.471
Oh, it's him.

17:14.871 --> 17:16.239
[Man]<i> This is a call from
an inmate...</i>

17:18.241 --> 17:19.576
Hey, Maurice.

17:19.910 --> 17:21.311
Hello.

17:21.311 --> 17:23.346
[Calvin]<i> You're on speaker phone
with me and Sabrina.</i>

17:23.647 --> 17:24.881
Hey, y'all.

17:24.881 --> 17:26.716
[Sabrina]<i> We have good news.</i>

17:27.217 --> 17:30.120
Oh, bitch, tell me
something good.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.988
Bayo's gonna give you
the money.

17:31.988 --> 17:33.890
-[Maurice]<i> Thank God.
</i>-Yes, yes.

17:33.890 --> 17:35.825
So we're working
to get you out right now.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.594
[Maurice]<i> Oh, good.</i>

17:37.594 --> 17:38.895
And as soon as I get home,

17:38.895 --> 17:41.331
I'm gonna take
a long bubble bath.

17:41.331 --> 17:43.133
[Sabrina]<i> That will be good.</i>

17:43.133 --> 17:45.001
And when I finish,

17:45.001 --> 17:47.537
I'm gonna invite him over
and give him some of this...

17:47.537 --> 17:48.705
[Sabrina]<i> Maurice, please.</i>

17:48.705 --> 17:50.607
Oh, yes, baby, when a man

17:50.607 --> 17:52.642
<i>puts out
that much money for me,</i>

17:52.642 --> 17:54.911
my throat got to be sore.

17:54.911 --> 17:58.081
Oh, my... That's not something
I wanna hear right now.

17:58.081 --> 18:00.350
[Maurice]<i> Mm, bitch,
you need to open your ears</i>

18:00.350 --> 18:03.053
because your throat
ain't pay the ransom.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.188
[Sabrina]<i> Maurice, stop.</i>

18:05.188 --> 18:06.423
Mm-mm!

18:06.423 --> 18:08.959
<i>Why is Calvin
being so quiet?</i>

18:08.959 --> 18:11.328
-He's here.
-[Maurice]<i> Calvin!</i>

18:12.562 --> 18:14.497
I'm glad you getting out,
Maurice.

18:14.497 --> 18:17.400
[Maurice]<i> No, you not. You mad.</i>

18:17.400 --> 18:18.969
No.

18:18.969 --> 18:20.537
[Maurice]<i> You're mad
that he is doing this for me</i>

18:20.537 --> 18:22.505
'cause you couldn't.

18:22.505 --> 18:24.074
[Calvin]<i> No, I'm not.</i>

18:24.074 --> 18:25.875
And I'm here to let you know

18:25.875 --> 18:28.178
that whatever
Sabrina did for me,

18:28.178 --> 18:29.446
I was worth it.

18:29.446 --> 18:31.381
-Excuse you?
-I'm not mad.

18:31.381 --> 18:34.050
[Maurice]<i> Oh, yes, baby,
my good Judy put out</i>

18:34.050 --> 18:36.252
-so I could get out.
-[Sabrina]<i> Maurice, stop.</i>

18:36.252 --> 18:38.588
[Calvin]<i> Maurice, stop,
just stop.</i>

18:39.022 --> 18:40.323
[Maurice]<i> How long?</i>

18:40.323 --> 18:41.858
Um, well, we're working on
everything now.

18:41.858 --> 18:43.593
Andi should be calling me soon.

18:43.593 --> 18:45.495
-[Maurice]<i> Hurry up.
</i>-We are.

18:46.329 --> 18:49.065
-We're on our way.
-Thank you so much.

18:49.065 --> 18:50.500
[Sabrina]<i> See you soon.</i>

18:50.500 --> 18:52.068
And I know it's my fault,

18:52.068 --> 18:55.505
but I just want to say
thank you so much, everybody.

18:55.505 --> 18:56.639
[Sabrina]<i> I love you.</i>

18:57.374 --> 19:00.310
-See you soon.
-[Maurice]<i> Oh, well, hurry up.</i>

19:00.677 --> 19:03.079
I'm gonna lose my virginity
in here, girl.

19:03.079 --> 19:05.615
I'm like a gentle rose petal

19:05.615 --> 19:08.685
in a field
full of weed-whackers.

19:09.519 --> 19:11.254
Cut me up, Daddy.

19:12.956 --> 19:14.758
They want my goodies.

19:14.758 --> 19:17.827
Maurice, don't do anything
stupid in there.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.630
As if dealing with Que
wasn't stupid enough.

19:20.630 --> 19:22.732
Ah, listen.

19:22.732 --> 19:24.434
I know what I'm doing
and I'll be fine.

19:24.434 --> 19:26.236
[Calvin] All right, man,
we'll be there soon.

19:26.236 --> 19:28.204
All right. Bye.

19:33.176 --> 19:35.111
Come on and choke me, Sheila.

19:38.214 --> 19:40.450
Do you want to come with me
to see Andi?

19:41.985 --> 19:45.155
Nah, um, I gotta
get back to work.

19:45.155 --> 19:49.859
Just call me when it's time
and I'll meet you down there.

19:50.126 --> 19:52.495
-Okay. You sure?
-[Calvin] All right.

19:53.063 --> 19:54.397
Yeah.

19:54.397 --> 19:55.765
Okay.

20:00.570 --> 20:02.705
Thank you for understanding.

20:02.705 --> 20:03.973
[Calvin] No problem.

20:04.307 --> 20:06.276
[Sabrina] I really
appreciate it.

20:07.243 --> 20:08.478
Yeah.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.414
We'll talk later?

20:12.515 --> 20:13.817
Sure.

20:14.818 --> 20:16.419
Don't be pouty.

20:30.467 --> 20:31.901
Yes!

20:34.446 --> 20:40.786
[music]

20:43.555 --> 20:44.823
[knocking on door]

20:44.823 --> 20:46.291
Come in.

20:47.693 --> 20:50.062
-Hey. You want a coffee?
-[Andi]<i> </i>Hey.

20:50.663 --> 20:53.432
-Uh, yeah, a fresh one?
-Yeah.

20:53.432 --> 20:55.200
You look a little stressed.

20:56.268 --> 20:57.403
I'm good.

20:58.570 --> 20:59.772
You sure?

20:59.772 --> 21:01.173
Yeah.

21:02.808 --> 21:04.143
How was your night last night?

21:05.477 --> 21:06.945
It was fine.

21:07.946 --> 21:10.249
And where'd you end up staying?

21:10.549 --> 21:12.618
I ended up going home.

21:12.618 --> 21:14.119
And how was that?

21:14.953 --> 21:17.923
We had to have
a coming-to-Jesus conversation.

21:18.991 --> 21:21.860
You didn't send him home
to be with the Lord, did you?

21:21.860 --> 21:23.529
-No, Andi.
-[Andi]<i> </i>Okay.

21:23.529 --> 21:25.397
This is fine.

21:25.397 --> 21:27.900
I mean, it will be fine.

21:28.734 --> 21:30.202
Are you sure?

21:30.436 --> 21:31.804
Yeah.

21:31.804 --> 21:33.472
-[Andi] Okay. Well...
-Yeah.

21:33.472 --> 21:36.375
If there is any way I can help,
you just let me know.

21:36.909 --> 21:38.277
-Yeah.
-[Andi] Okay.

21:38.277 --> 21:41.146
So how did things go with Karen?

21:43.749 --> 21:45.451
Karen apologized.

21:46.318 --> 21:50.489
-She did?
-Right. Yeah, I was shocked.

21:50.489 --> 21:51.990
Well, that's good.

21:52.357 --> 21:53.425
[Andi] Yeah.

21:54.326 --> 21:56.628
-It is good.
-[Fatima] Yeah.

21:56.628 --> 22:00.132
So now we can all move forward.

22:00.933 --> 22:02.968
-Looks that way.
-[Fatima] Good.

22:02.968 --> 22:06.338
Speaking of moving forward,
um...

22:08.107 --> 22:11.577
I received the child support
documents from Zac.

22:12.144 --> 22:13.045
Oh.

22:13.045 --> 22:15.280
Zac is being really generous.

22:15.814 --> 22:18.417
That is all Zac's doing.

22:19.384 --> 22:20.719
Are you sure?

22:20.719 --> 22:23.155
Yeah, I mean, I encouraged him
to get it on paper,

22:23.155 --> 22:25.924
but all the details
are Zac's doing.

22:26.558 --> 22:29.661
Okay, well, I am gonna tell
Karen she should sign this.

22:30.095 --> 22:32.431
Good. Thank you.

22:32.431 --> 22:33.966
Yes.

22:36.435 --> 22:38.437
Now another thing.

22:39.571 --> 22:41.406
[Andi] What's that about?

22:41.406 --> 22:42.641
I don't know.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.481
That can't be good.

22:50.015 --> 22:52.050
You know I'm gonna find out.

-[Andi]<i> </i>Well, keep me posted.
-I will.

22:53.986 --> 22:57.122
Also, um, could you get
the information

22:57.122 --> 22:58.257
for Maurice's bail?

22:58.257 --> 23:00.259
And call the number
that I gave you.

23:00.259 --> 23:02.494
Tell them where
to wire the funds.

23:02.494 --> 23:03.929
The number? I...

23:03.929 --> 23:05.664
The number I texted you
this morning.

23:07.599 --> 23:08.767
Oh, yeah, you did do that.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.169
Okay, all right, I'm on it, yes.

23:10.169 --> 23:11.937
You were having
a coming-to-Jesus moment. Okay.

23:11.937 --> 23:13.505
It has been a rough morning,
rough night.

23:13.505 --> 23:15.307
-[Fatima]<i> </i>Thank you.
-It's okay. No problem.

[Fatima]<i> Hey.</i>

23:43.869 --> 23:44.937
What's up?

23:44.937 --> 23:46.338
[Fatima]<i> I'm good.</i>

23:46.972 --> 23:48.273
Okay.

23:48.907 --> 23:50.442
<i>I'm still coming
to see you for lunch?</i>

23:50.442 --> 23:53.612
Okay, cool, um,
I talked to Andi.

23:53.612 --> 23:54.847
[Zac]<i> Okay, and?</i>

23:54.847 --> 23:56.582
She said
that she looked up the documents

23:56.582 --> 23:59.985
<i>and she's gonna tell
Karen that she should sign them.</i>

23:59.985 --> 24:01.987
Okay, good. Good, good, good.

24:01.987 --> 24:03.255
[Fatima]<i> Yeah.</i>

24:03.255 --> 24:04.890
One down, one down.

24:04.890 --> 24:06.658
Yeah, but, um...

24:07.192 --> 24:08.694
[Zac]<i> But what?</i>

24:09.561 --> 24:12.698
Zac, I really think
you should apologize to her.

24:12.698 --> 24:14.266
What?

24:14.266 --> 24:15.601
[Fatima]<i> Look, I don't know
what you offered her,</i>

24:15.601 --> 24:17.970
<i>but Andi said
you were very generous.</i>

24:17.970 --> 24:19.538
And we need to be sure

24:19.538 --> 24:21.940
that she stills wants to sign
these papers.

24:21.940 --> 24:23.075
Shit.

24:23.075 --> 24:24.576
[Fatima]<i> You were wrong.</i>

24:24.877 --> 24:26.278
I know. I know.

24:26.278 --> 24:28.747
[Fatima]<i> All right,
so go apologize to her.</i>

24:29.014 --> 24:30.749
All right, all right.

24:31.116 --> 24:33.485
Zac, just go
and say you're sorry.

24:33.785 --> 24:34.987
[Zac]<i> What?</i>

24:35.354 --> 24:36.922
Look, --,
this is not about you.

24:36.922 --> 24:38.757
This is about your future.

24:38.757 --> 24:40.292
What are you talking about?

24:40.292 --> 24:43.061
[Fatima]<i> Zac, she can make this
really hard for you.</i>

24:43.061 --> 24:44.463
Yeah, I know that.

24:44.463 --> 24:47.566
Okay. Look, just like
Heather and Hayden are.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.902
[Zac]<i> I know.</i>

24:49.902 --> 24:55.040
All right, so just go
say you're sorry.

24:55.307 --> 24:57.075
She ain't gonna take my call.

24:57.075 --> 24:59.144
[Fatima]<i> Then go over there.</i>

24:59.978 --> 25:01.647
Are you serious?

25:02.948 --> 25:05.183
Zac, keep playing me
for the fool.

25:05.584 --> 25:07.119
[Zac]<i> What do you mean, like...</i>

25:07.119 --> 25:09.821
The girl has you
by the balls, all right?

25:09.821 --> 25:11.156
And if we gonna have a future...

25:11.156 --> 25:13.425
[Zac]<i> I like the sound of that.</i>

25:14.226 --> 25:16.895
Okay. Then go talk to her.

25:17.396 --> 25:18.630
So you want me to go over there

25:18.630 --> 25:20.532
so somebody else
can take a picture?

25:20.532 --> 25:23.702
[Fatima]<i> Okay, that's fair.
But look, baby, I trust you.</i>

25:24.303 --> 25:27.139
All right. I'll...
I'll think about it.

25:27.773 --> 25:29.841
All right, you think about it
if you want to

25:29.841 --> 25:31.510
and see how that goes for you.

25:31.510 --> 25:32.911
What?

25:33.612 --> 25:35.480
[Fatima]<i> Look, Zac,
I'm a woman, okay?</i>

25:35.480 --> 25:38.116
And if it were me,
I would be pissed.

25:38.116 --> 25:40.786
I'd be thinking of
all kinds of ways to hurt you.

25:41.153 --> 25:42.254
Yo, Fatima,
let me tell you something.

25:42.254 --> 25:43.922
When you say shit like that...

25:43.922 --> 25:46.058
[Fatima]<i> Look, Zac,
I'm just telling you the truth.</i>

25:46.058 --> 25:47.693
All right.

25:47.693 --> 25:49.728
[Fatima]<i> You don't have
that much money, all right?</i>

25:50.329 --> 25:51.930
What are you talking about?

25:52.431 --> 25:53.999
Look, it seems like a lot,

25:53.999 --> 25:56.368
but when you realize it,
it's not.

25:56.935 --> 25:59.571
[Zac]<i> All right.
I got it, I got it, I got it.</i>

26:00.272 --> 26:01.540
All right, good.

26:01.540 --> 26:05.377
So come see me
after you go see Karen.

26:05.377 --> 26:06.778
Shit.

Robin.

27:15.881 --> 27:17.449
Thank you.

You're good?

Hayden.

27:34.599 --> 27:35.867
Robin.

27:36.868 --> 27:38.804
You can have a seat as well.

27:39.104 --> 27:40.672
Well, thank you.

27:43.909 --> 27:45.444
So what's going on?

27:45.444 --> 27:46.912
Oh, I'll tell you
what's going on...

27:46.912 --> 27:47.946
Oh, Hayden.

27:48.947 --> 27:50.515
-I got this.
-What?

27:50.515 --> 27:53.285
Yeah, let me bring it down
just a little bit.

27:53.285 --> 27:54.653
You got it.

27:55.020 --> 27:58.190
Well, as you know,

27:59.391 --> 28:01.760
Hayden has a client
on the board.

28:02.861 --> 28:04.362
Yes.

28:04.896 --> 28:07.132
And they did a call.

28:07.599 --> 28:09.601
These are all things I know.

28:10.469 --> 28:13.872
So you had to have your money.

28:15.173 --> 28:16.775
And I raised it all.

28:17.275 --> 28:18.643
You've...

28:19.377 --> 28:20.445
Well, yeah, we were...

28:20.445 --> 28:22.214
He did. He did raise it all.

28:22.214 --> 28:24.516
Yeah, we know you've raised it.

28:26.985 --> 28:28.420
So what are you doing here?

28:29.454 --> 28:32.757
Well, they raised it
by $10 million.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.828
Excuse me?

28:37.796 --> 28:40.599
I know. Believe me,
it was a shock to me too. I...

28:40.599 --> 28:43.034
The partners decided
to contribute

28:43.034 --> 28:44.870
an additional 20% to the raise.

28:47.005 --> 28:48.707
Which is crazy.

28:49.207 --> 28:51.409
That means that you
gotta come up with

28:51.409 --> 28:54.513
an additional $3 million.

28:56.281 --> 28:57.816
I see.

28:59.117 --> 29:00.585
We know you do.

29:03.155 --> 29:07.526
So are you prepared
to do that today?

29:10.195 --> 29:12.497
Why do I have to do that today?

29:14.666 --> 29:17.769
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you not read the contract?

29:18.336 --> 29:19.638
Yes, I did.

29:19.638 --> 29:22.507
Oh. Good. So then you saw

29:22.507 --> 29:26.011
that you have to match the funds
on the same day.

29:27.212 --> 29:29.548
-Did you read the contract?
-[Hayden]<i> </i>Absolutely.

29:29.548 --> 29:33.518
Paragraph three, which says
"within a reasonable time."

29:34.085 --> 29:36.454
[Hayden] Right, I forgot
about paragraph three.

29:37.189 --> 29:38.757
-Right.
-[Gary] Paragraph three.

29:38.757 --> 29:42.460
So what would be a reasonable
time for you, Robin?

29:44.596 --> 29:46.998
Oh, I think 30 days
would be reasonable.

29:47.399 --> 29:48.700
Thirty days?

29:48.700 --> 29:49.834
Yeah.

29:50.569 --> 29:51.803
That's not gonna happen.

29:52.837 --> 29:54.172
You think so?

29:54.172 --> 29:56.007
-Oh, I know so. Yeah.
-[Robin]<i> </i>Oh, is that right?

29:56.007 --> 29:57.576
Come on, guys, guys.

29:57.576 --> 30:00.345
Let's not get off on the wrong
exit here, all right?

30:00.345 --> 30:03.582
This is a simple, simple matter.

30:06.685 --> 30:08.620
Robin, you take
a minority share.

30:10.188 --> 30:12.257
We know
you can't raise the money,

30:12.257 --> 30:14.693
so there's no need
to prolong the time.

30:18.530 --> 30:20.665
I don't have to raise anything.

30:24.536 --> 30:26.338
You want another three million?
Fine.

30:26.338 --> 30:28.640
It'll be there by 5 o'clock.

30:30.775 --> 30:31.977
Is that so?

30:32.644 --> 30:35.380
Yes, is that a reasonable enough
time for you?

30:38.283 --> 30:40.051
Reasonable for me.

30:41.052 --> 30:43.488
All right, I guess it is.

30:43.488 --> 30:44.656
[Robin]<i> </i>Wonderful.

30:45.423 --> 30:48.994
So y'all can get out my office
and we'll talk about it then.

30:49.394 --> 30:51.830
-[Hayden] We'll see you at 5:00.
-Okay, great.

30:52.597 --> 30:54.399
Five 'o' clock, Robin.

30:56.735 --> 30:58.103

31:36.817 --> 31:39.486
Um, I saw Tamara up here.
What...

31:39.486 --> 31:41.188
Oh, yeah. She's here for Hayden.

31:41.188 --> 31:43.123
He had her
fill out an application.

31:43.724 --> 31:45.459
An application for what?

31:45.459 --> 31:47.961
For secretary. Secretary.

31:48.261 --> 31:49.730
Okay, um, where is she now?

31:49.730 --> 31:51.665
She's in the break room,
filling it out.

31:51.665 --> 31:55.001
Perfect. Listen,
if you see Hayden coming around,

31:55.001 --> 31:56.503
-just let me know, okay?
-[Linda] Got you.

31:56.503 --> 31:58.138

32:07.614 --> 32:10.517
I know you wondering
what I'm doing here.

32:11.485 --> 32:13.453
Yes, I am.

This -- is trying
to get me a job here.

-Wait, a job?
-Yeah.

32:20.494 --> 32:22.129
You know you can't do that.

32:22.129 --> 32:23.830
I told him that.

32:23.830 --> 32:26.967
Then why are you sitting here,
filling out an application?

32:26.967 --> 32:28.668
Well, I just... I...

32:28.668 --> 32:31.338
Tamara, you cannot work here.

32:31.338 --> 32:32.706
[Tamara]<i> </i>Okay.

32:32.706 --> 32:34.841
Look, you just gotta
make up an excuse.

32:35.175 --> 32:37.210
Okay. I will.

32:37.878 --> 32:40.914
So back to the program,
did you look at his calendar?

32:40.914 --> 32:43.383

what you gotta do.

34:15.442 --> 34:16.776
Okay, I will.

34:16.776 --> 34:19.946
Um, it may take a little time,

34:19.946 --> 34:23.550

how you are.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.295
Danni.

34:35.295 --> 34:37.364
What the hell has happened now?

34:37.764 --> 34:39.900

I went over to her house
and I saw her with him.

34:52.646 --> 34:54.915
Apparently, he's working
at the airport now.

34:56.416 --> 34:58.285
Wait, what?

34:58.285 --> 35:00.253
[Sabrina]<i> Yeah. I know.</i>

35:01.621 --> 35:04.324
Okay, Atlanta

35:06.760 --> 35:09.696
So what did she say
when you told her

35:09.696 --> 35:12.032
that that's the Que?

35:12.566 --> 35:14.901
I mean, what can she say, right?

35:15.268 --> 35:17.971
But I did tell her
that we do have to talk.

35:17.971 --> 35:19.205
-You did?
-[Sabrina]<i> </i>Yeah.

35:19.205 --> 35:20.874
Okay, yeah, 'cause we do.

35:21.207 --> 35:23.276

kind of reminds me of?

35:23.276 --> 35:24.911
College.

35:26.279 --> 35:27.514
Yeah.

35:27.948 --> 35:29.816
Okay, so are we
going over to her house?

35:29.816 --> 35:31.651
-Yes, we are.
-Okay.

35:46.166 --> 35:49.269
Well, at least we were able
to get Maurice out.

35:49.970 --> 35:51.037
Right.

35:51.037 --> 35:53.440
And we need to talk about that
as well.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.908
Okay.

35:55.575 --> 35:57.510
How were you able
to get that man

35:57.510 --> 36:00.714
to give you such a large sum
of money?

36:01.314 --> 36:02.782
I just asked.

36:03.383 --> 36:04.818
And he said yes?

36:06.019 --> 36:09.155
Yes. Guess he really likes me.

36:09.422 --> 36:10.824
[Andi] Okay.

36:12.359 --> 36:13.660
[Sabrina] What?

Oh, nothing. I'm just saying
I'm... I mean, I'm...

36:17.897 --> 36:19.966
What are you trying to say,
Andi?

36:20.667 --> 36:24.004
I mean, Gary buys you condos
and Rolls-Royces.

36:24.004 --> 36:27.207
You don't think
a man can do the same for me?

36:27.207 --> 36:30.710
Sabrina, that's not what I said,
and that's not what I'm saying.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.646
Sounded like it.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.015
I'm sorry.

36:35.015 --> 36:37.751
I'm saying it sounds like

36:37.751 --> 36:39.986
he must really trust
and like you.

36:39.986 --> 36:42.822
I mean, he gave you
a lot of money for someone else.

36:43.623 --> 36:45.992
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

36:46.693 --> 36:49.529

Maurice will do the right thing.
