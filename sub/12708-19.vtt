00:01.234 --> 00:02.735
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.705
-Why won't you sleep
with me again?
-Because I don't love you.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.408
Like hell.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.743
-I thought you were
gonna go see Tara.
-She's seeing someone else.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.946
-Probably just friends.
-We should have
some coffee sometime.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.283
I'm free tomorrow.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.192
-Whoa.
-WARREN: Shut it down!
Shut it all down!

00:24.225 --> 00:26.160
Is that the camera
in the Magic Box?

00:26.193 --> 00:27.894
Oh, my God.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.164
Oh, God.
What is she--

00:30.198 --> 00:31.998
That's enough.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.768
You left me, Xander.
At the altar.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.404
I don't owe you anything.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.439
So you go out and bang
the first body you can find?

00:39.472 --> 00:40.673
It's good enough for Buffy.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.076
Shut up
and leave her out of--

00:44.112 --> 00:45.612
Tara?

00:45.646 --> 00:49.517
You can't just
have coffee and expect--

00:49.549 --> 00:52.552
-I know.
-There's just so much
to work through.

00:52.585 --> 00:57.024
Trust has to be built again.
On both sides.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.128
Can we just skip it?

01:00.161 --> 01:02.096
Can you--
Can you just be kissing me now?

01:08.769 --> 01:11.338
(moaning)

01:12.072 --> 01:14.775
(giggling)

01:21.414 --> 01:25.286
When did
morning happen?
After the moon went down.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.287
(laughs)

01:34.262 --> 01:36.430
Mmm...

01:36.463 --> 01:38.498
Oh...

01:38.531 --> 01:41.935
Mmm. I forgot how good
this could feel.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.771
Us together.

01:45.838 --> 01:47.575
Without the magic.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.210
-There was plenty of magic.
-(laughs)

01:52.212 --> 01:54.647
(sighs)
It's getting late.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.016
-Want to get up?
-No.

01:57.049 --> 02:00.688
-Oh, God. No.
-(chuckles) Mmm.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.956
I was just thinking
about Buffy.

02:03.823 --> 02:06.626
Oh, she still isn't back?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.163
I didn't hear her.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.998
She wouldn't talk about
what happened...

02:12.032 --> 02:15.269
at the magic shop
when she got home last night.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.638
She just wanted to know
how close I was...

02:17.670 --> 02:21.775
to tracing the camera signal
back to the empire of the nerds.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.943
Then, she left again.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.447
I'm sure she'll be okay.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.649
Yeah, I--
I'm not really worried
about her...

02:28.681 --> 02:30.918
going up against
Warren and the others.

02:32.186 --> 02:35.021
I know this is going
to sound crazy,

02:35.055 --> 02:37.925
but I think something
might be going on.

02:38.725 --> 02:42.695
With Spike and Buffy.

02:42.729 --> 02:47.968
I mean, she looked so hurt
when she saw him with Anya.
I think maybe--

02:48.001 --> 02:49.637
They've been sleeping
together.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.372
(laughs) No.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.841
I wouldn't go that far.

02:53.873 --> 02:56.909
No, I mean,
she told me they've
been sleeping together.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.747
Sleeping together?

03:00.781 --> 03:03.015
You mean, like,
the naked kind of "together"?

03:03.050 --> 03:07.221
(sighs) I'm sorry I didn't say
anything, but I, I promised her
I wouldn't.

03:09.021 --> 03:11.425
Does everybody else know?
Am I the only one she didn't--

03:11.459 --> 03:13.661
God, no. She--
She didn't even mean
to tell me.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.127
It just came out.

03:17.264 --> 03:21.001
How could she hide
something like this
from me?

03:21.033 --> 03:23.371
I think she was afraid
of the look you'd get
on your face.

03:25.104 --> 03:26.939
Kind of like the one
you're wearing now.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.109
Oh, no. I'm not--

03:29.141 --> 03:31.844
I'm just
trying to understand.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.581
So is she.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.953
Wow. She probably
really needs someone
to talk to.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.290
Probably.

03:43.324 --> 03:47.127
We've been kind of busy.
Maybe we didn't hear her
come home.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.599
(knocking)
Buffy?

03:54.634 --> 03:55.836
(sighs)

03:57.504 --> 03:58.972
DAWN: She back yet?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.408
Uh, not yet.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.610
I'm sure
she'll be home soon.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.080
-Everything's fine.
Just go back to bed.
-(scoffs) It's ten o'clock.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.750
Oh. Uh--

04:09.782 --> 04:13.387
You don't think she's
gonna hurt Spike, do you?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.788
She told you about Spike?

04:15.823 --> 04:17.925
It was kind of obvious
after last night.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.761
Yeah, I totally knew.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.163
Must have hurt so much.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.399
To see him
and, and, and Anya like that.

04:26.434 --> 04:30.437
And poor Xander.
Everything is so screwed up.

04:30.471 --> 04:34.841
It's gonna be all right.
It's just complicated.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.011
You know, when, when people
have such strong feelings
for each other, sometimes--

04:38.045 --> 04:40.348
Is she back yet?

04:40.380 --> 04:43.451
-Oh. Hey.
-(chuckles) You and--

04:43.483 --> 04:46.853
Uh, that's my cue
to go put some clothes on.
No! No, no, no!

04:46.887 --> 04:49.990
I-I-I'm totally not here.
You guys, you do whatever
you want.

04:50.023 --> 04:53.259
Um, I'll go watch TV! (giggles)
Downstairs, really loud,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.163
in the basement,
where I can't hear
anything.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.865
(squeals)
Oh, my God!

04:58.899 --> 05:02.302
I love you guys!
(squeals)

05:06.574 --> 05:08.742
All right.
Let's make this quick.

05:15.882 --> 05:19.519
Fine. But I'm not leaving
till we have a little chat.

05:27.259 --> 05:31.197
Very little, considering
the pummeling that needs
to occur.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.641
I mean, guys, hello?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.177
Slayer here.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.613
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't find you?

05:59.893 --> 06:02.396
-Well, that can't be good.
-(metallic grinding)

06:18.745 --> 06:22.615
(grunting)

06:22.649 --> 06:24.617
(groans)

06:27.788 --> 06:31.759
Okay.
That's gonna cost ya.

06:35.127 --> 06:37.665
(theme music playing)

07:33.987 --> 07:35.988
Okay, we're here,
ready for action.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.759
Uh, uh, bad guy fighting action.
(laughs)

07:39.793 --> 07:41.629
Guys, you didn't have to,
you know,

07:41.661 --> 07:43.764
if you still want to be
alone.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.600
-No, no. We're good.
-We're better than good.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.101
Great.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.704
Super.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.942
(giggles) Aw...

07:55.975 --> 07:59.713
-Okay. All right. We'll stop.
-Oh, you better not!

07:59.747 --> 08:02.014
So, um, nerds?
How are them-- they?

08:02.048 --> 08:03.850
Well, I found their lair,

08:03.884 --> 08:05.451
but they obviously knew we were
tracing their signal.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.954
They left in a hurry.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.189
The van was gone,
but everything else
was still there.

08:09.221 --> 08:12.560
Uh, we should go back. Um, Tara
and I can Sherlock around and--

08:12.593 --> 08:14.961
Nothing left now.
Giant buzz saw.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.865
It was a thing.
This is all that
I could save.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.634
I, I, I know it's not much,
but we need to go through it
and see if we can find...

08:20.668 --> 08:23.502
anything that might
tell us what, they're doing,
where they're going.

08:25.838 --> 08:30.242
-Uh, this might
take a while.
-(nervous Chuckles)

08:30.276 --> 08:31.978
Anything we can do
to fast-forward?

08:32.010 --> 08:34.715
We need to find Warren and
the others before
anyone else gets hurt.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.317
Should we call Xander?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.687
I don't think he's really
in the Scooby space.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.488
We need to give him some time.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.758
Maybe they've heard
something in the demon bars
about those guys?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.095
-Uh, Spike--
-Spike!

08:48.128 --> 08:50.297
Spike's not
part of the team.

08:52.131 --> 08:55.735
So, he's not going
to be around anymore?

08:57.269 --> 09:00.707
Uh, I, I don't know, Dawn.
Not, not for a while.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.777
What about Anya?
She might be able to help
with the demon text.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.879
(sighs)
I'm guessing she's not feeling
real researchy right now.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.282
(sobbing)

09:10.549 --> 09:13.620
I know how you feel.
Maybe I can help.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.758
How could Carl do that
to me, that bastard?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.726
He's a man.
Look no further.

09:19.759 --> 09:24.397
But with my sister?
She's not even pretty.

09:24.431 --> 09:29.802
Well, it isn't
always about looks,
or a beating heart.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.471
Sometimes
intimate sweaty relations
with the wrong person...

09:32.504 --> 09:34.407
just seems like
a good idea at the time.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.543
She's fat.
He cheated on me...

09:37.576 --> 09:41.148
with my fat, ugly sister.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.884
Likes 'em fleshy, huh?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.985
Bet you wish he'd bloat up
a couple of thousand pounds,

09:46.019 --> 09:48.788
and pop like
a big old meat zeppelin,
don't you?

09:48.822 --> 09:51.457
-He said he loved me.
-Well, gee. Then he
must have meant it,

09:51.490 --> 09:55.227
'cause, hey, guys never
say anything they don't
really mean, do they?

09:55.261 --> 09:58.498
-But we--
-They say, "I love you,"
and, and you think it's true.

09:58.530 --> 10:03.336
They say, "Oh, Anya.
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life."

10:03.370 --> 10:05.138
And, and you believe them.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.474
You believe they feel
the same way about you,
because that's the way...

10:07.506 --> 10:10.143
-love's supposed to be,
right?
-Who's Anya?

10:10.177 --> 10:13.279
And then you get all excited
with the tingly anticipation.
But wait!

10:13.312 --> 10:15.916
Not so fast.
There's the apocalypse.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.451
And the back from the grave.
And the blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.855
And by the time you're standing
there in that beautifully
expensive white dress...

10:21.889 --> 10:24.291
you've dreamed about
ever since you became human,

10:24.323 --> 10:28.061
he gets all heebie-jeebie
and decides, "You know,
I'd rather just go steady."

10:29.461 --> 10:32.865
Men suck.
I wish Carl's flesh would--

10:32.899 --> 10:35.268
You know, he said it isn't me,
but how can I believe him?

10:35.302 --> 10:38.871
I mean,
he knew he didn't want
to get married.

10:38.905 --> 10:42.509
Deep down, he knew.
But he lied to me
every day for months.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.445
-I wish--
-And he lied and lied
and lied some more.

10:45.477 --> 10:49.381
'Cause, hey, who's gonna notice
with all the other lies flying
around like little monkeys.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.786
Then he thinks he can just
sweep the carnage underneath
the rug by saying, "Oh--"

10:52.820 --> 10:56.389
ANDREW: I'm sorry!
Sorry! I'm sorry!

10:56.423 --> 10:58.792
Sorry, please!
I'll never try to desecrate
your chamber again!

10:58.826 --> 11:02.830
-(growling)
-Don't hurt me, please.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.532
(roars)

11:05.565 --> 11:10.037
-Hit him again!
Hit him again!
-DEMON: (shrieking)

11:10.070 --> 11:12.404
Wow.
These things are tougher
than I thought.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.142
You know, one jolt from this
should've dropped an elephant.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.244
You want a piece
of this, huh? Yeah!

11:17.277 --> 11:20.047
Not so tough,
are ya now,
Pufnstuf!

11:20.080 --> 11:23.582
Hey, hey, hey! We need
him fresh, all right?
Not smokehouse.

11:23.615 --> 11:27.386
I'm done bein' the bait.
Next time, one of you
can wiggle on the hook.

11:29.621 --> 11:33.259
If this works, the next time
we'll be the thing that
everyone's afraid of.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.029
Okay, so... what now?

11:38.731 --> 11:40.133
Well, now,
it's your turn, Sparky.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.614
DAWN:
Does it help?

11:59.418 --> 12:01.453
(smacks Lips)
It doesn't hurt.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.229
Not plannin'
a campout, are we?
No.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.398
I'm sleeping
over at Janice's.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.302
Figured Willow and Tara
might want some time to, uh--

12:18.270 --> 12:20.407
Oh, so the birds
are flying again, eh?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.576
Ain't love grand?

12:28.347 --> 12:31.683
I wanted to stop by
on my way and, you know--

12:35.121 --> 12:37.624
Everybody's
pretty mad at you.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.993
Yeah.
Kinda picked up
on that.

12:43.129 --> 12:47.000
You're not gonna be
coming around anymore, are you?

12:50.370 --> 12:53.405
It's complicated,
nibblet.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.475
(chuckles)
Everybody's been saying that.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.312
It must be true then.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.285
Was it worth it?

13:06.318 --> 13:08.120
What you did with Anya?

13:09.655 --> 13:11.390
Buffy told you?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.294
Kinda caught the show.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.097
There was a camera
somewhere in the Magic Box.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.799
Uh, Warren and, and Jonathan
and that other guy
have been watching Buffy--

13:20.833 --> 13:24.071
(sighs)
Wankers.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.811
Do you love her?

13:33.513 --> 13:35.048
Oh, no. No.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.852
It was just a, uh,

13:41.087 --> 13:43.990
it was a bad day,
for both of us.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.326
And we'd just had
a few drinks,
and things just--

13:46.359 --> 13:49.361
No. And not Anya.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.331
Buffy.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.067
Do you
really love her?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.773
Then how could you
do that to her?

14:03.910 --> 14:07.413
Oh right, 'cause big sis
was treatin' me so well
up until that point.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.017
(sighs)

14:10.049 --> 14:12.684
Must still be
a bit of the evil
left in me after all.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.388
I don't know
what happened
between you two.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.759
But what you did last night?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.394
If you wanted to hurt Buffy,
congratulations.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.365
It worked.

14:31.703 --> 14:34.874
(door opens,
closes)

14:34.908 --> 14:38.044
(gurgling growl)

14:45.118 --> 14:47.120
This is it.
We found it.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.389
-You sure it's in there?
-Be careful.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.158
Only Nezzla demons can
pass through the barrier.

14:57.596 --> 15:00.332
-Everything else
gets curly fried.
-JONATHAN: This sucks.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.535
Just make sure
all your skin's covered.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.072
Why can't I
just use a glamour?

15:06.105 --> 15:09.208
You can't Siegfried and Roy
the barrier. It's gotta be
the real deal.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.078
-(groans)
-(laughs)

15:12.111 --> 15:14.647
-It's still wet.
-Good. Then it should, uh,

15:14.681 --> 15:17.250
-still be fresh enough.
-Should be?

15:17.283 --> 15:19.286
Wait a minute.
What do you mean--
What do you mean should be?

15:19.318 --> 15:21.087
What? Wait--
(screams)

15:21.120 --> 15:24.256
-(groans)
-I wasn't sure that would work.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.330
Jackass.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.634
-You think he knows?
-Well, if he did,
why would he be here?

15:35.668 --> 15:39.405
Why is he? Our mojo's
tight, bro. We could have
pulled this ourselves.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.274
Yeah, well, somebody
had to guinea pig
the meat suit.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.842
Were, were you gonna volunteer?

15:45.011 --> 15:48.248
(nervous laugh)

15:48.280 --> 15:51.618
-I don't trust that leprechaun.
-Okay, just stay frosty. If this
works the way we planned it,

15:51.650 --> 15:54.287
by the end of the evening,
Jonathan won't be a problem.

15:58.357 --> 16:01.427
-You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.264
-ANDREW: That's it?
-JONATHAN: It better be.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.268
No way I'm goin' back
through there. That thing
stings like a mother.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.202
Dude.
Unholy hair gel.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.272
-Get off.
-Make me, skin job.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.006
Just shut up.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.677
(whirring, beeping)

16:21.847 --> 16:25.217
(grunts)
Oh!

16:26.753 --> 16:31.124
Gentlemen,
the Orbs of Nezzla'Khan.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.461
Strength, invulnerability.
The deluxe package.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.163
They're everything
I've ever dreamed of.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.067
You know, those things
have been down there
for, like, a zillion years.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.070
-How do we know
they'll still work?
-(power surging)

16:46.173 --> 16:49.176
(laughs)

16:49.209 --> 16:51.211
Ah, they work.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.254
JONATHAN:
You don't look any different.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.655
I thought they were
supposed to make us
all huge and veiny.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.159
-Are you sure
they're working right?
-(growling)

17:06.192 --> 17:07.626
Let's find out.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.268
Mahatma.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.438
-Welcome to the show, boys!
-That was so hot.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.507
-Let me try 'em!
-Watch the paws, little man.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.843
Ow.
You're supposed to share.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.680
Oh, relax.
Now, you'll each get a whirl.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.950
As soon as I'm done
playing with them.
(chuckles)

17:33.286 --> 17:34.421
(knocking)

17:37.089 --> 17:38.458
Hey.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.626
Hey.

17:42.761 --> 17:46.031
I think there's still
a cold one in the fridge.
Thanks.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.301
But, uh, I, I think it's still
a little early for me.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.511
She loves you.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.481
You know that.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.151
Anya was just--

18:05.417 --> 18:07.987
She was hurting.

18:08.019 --> 18:11.657
She was hurting,
and, and she did
this really stupid thing.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.861
(chuckles)
With your boyfriend.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.931
He's not my boyfriend.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.866
I know why Anya--

18:22.368 --> 18:25.637
I understand. I do.
But you?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.675
(chuckles)

18:29.709 --> 18:32.044
All those times
I told Spike to get lost.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.183
That he didn't have a chance
with a girl like you.
(laughs)

18:37.217 --> 18:39.685
You don't know
how hard it's been.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.954
-What, lying to me?
-Being here.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.857
After I was brought back.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.597
(exhales)

18:51.631 --> 18:55.701
You have no idea how
hard it is just being here.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.770
-You could have told me.
-You didn't want to know.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.040
So you went to him instead.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.644
Xander, what I do
with my personal life
is none of your business.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.980
It used to be.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.053
It just happened, okay?

19:14.086 --> 19:16.388
(laughs)
Oh, like uh,

19:16.423 --> 19:18.391
"Say, you're evil.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.192
Get on me?"

19:21.728 --> 19:24.963
You fought
side-by-side with him
when I was gone.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.201
-You let him take care of Dawn.
-But I never forgot
what he really is.

19:30.036 --> 19:34.574
-God, what were you thinking?
-(laughing)
You're asking me that?

19:34.606 --> 19:37.544
Oh, 'cause
your decision-making skills
have really sparkled lately.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.979
I'm not saying I
didn't make any mistakes.

19:40.011 --> 19:43.715
But last time I checked,
slaughtering half of Europe
wasn't one of them.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.385
He doesn't have
a soul, Buffy.

19:46.419 --> 19:50.056
Just some leash
they jammed in his head.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.892
You think he'd still be
all snuggles if that chip
ever stopped working?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.694
Would you still trust him
with Dawn then?

19:57.463 --> 20:00.199
It doesn't matter.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.602
I'm not seeing him anymore.

20:02.634 --> 20:06.071
-It's over.
-Yeah.

20:06.105 --> 20:10.142
There's a lot of that
goin' around.
(can crumpling)

20:11.278 --> 20:14.846
(door opens,
slams shut)

20:14.881 --> 20:17.750
(somber guitar plays)

20:17.784 --> 20:23.589
* It's just a simple line

20:23.623 --> 20:26.425
* I can still hear it

20:26.459 --> 20:29.729
* All of the time

20:29.761 --> 20:35.034
* But if I can just
 hold on tonight *

20:35.067 --> 20:40.573
* I know that nothing
 nothing survives *

20:40.606 --> 20:43.174
* Nothing survives

20:46.679 --> 20:52.384
* I think I'm turned around

20:52.419 --> 20:56.855
* I'm lookin' up
 not lookin' down *

20:58.290 --> 21:03.730
* And when I'm standing still

21:03.762 --> 21:09.167
* Watchin' you run
 Watchin' you fall *

21:09.201 --> 21:12.672
* Fallin'
WILLOW:
It's all a mess.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.407
These things take time.
We'll figure it out.

21:15.442 --> 21:19.612
Sure, we'll decipher codes,
foil evil schemes.

21:19.645 --> 21:23.082
-Finally get out of bed.
-I was with ya up until there.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.250
-(chuckles)
-Whoa.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.489
-What is it?
-Uh, one of their data CD's.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.325
It's filled with encrypted
blueprints, schematics.

21:32.358 --> 21:35.961
-To what?
-I'm not sure.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.597
Their designations
have been stripped.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.367
Maybe we can
cross-reference them
with the county clerk's office.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.269
Would that involve
getting up?

21:44.302 --> 21:47.807
-Eventually.
-Then I'm coming out
firmly against it.

21:47.839 --> 21:51.443
What about
the Trio's evil scheme?

21:51.478 --> 21:54.846
Well, I'm kinda busy
workin' on my own.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.249
(laughs)

22:04.656 --> 22:07.292
You're all wet.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.696
It's a good thing
I'm part fish.
Which part?

22:10.730 --> 22:13.665
-The part with the hook in it.
-Careful.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.734
Someone might reel you in.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.970
Yeah, but...

22:18.003 --> 22:22.040
then there'd be the flopping
and the gasping and,

22:22.074 --> 22:24.042
sure, maybe it'd work out,
but chances are...

22:24.076 --> 22:25.711
I'd up and leave you
at the helm in your white dress,

22:25.744 --> 22:28.480
then find you spawning
with another fish
who turns out to be...

22:28.515 --> 22:31.217
spawning my very good friend,
night and day, behind my back.

22:31.250 --> 22:35.922
And then comes the fighting,
and again with the flopping
and the gasping, it's--

22:35.954 --> 22:39.191
Hey, Chicken of the Sea
here's not doin' too good
with the women these days.

22:39.224 --> 22:42.094
-Huh?
-Sorry. I'm just...

22:42.127 --> 22:44.631
lookin' to curl up
with a quiet alone tonight.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.340
We don't have time for this.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.743
Ease up, twitchy.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.078
All right.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.248
Let's make some noise.

23:08.253 --> 23:11.123
Not bad. How hard
you gonna hit when you're
blowin' in the wind?

23:12.791 --> 23:14.926
Oh!

23:15.662 --> 23:18.130
(groans)

23:18.163 --> 23:20.700
That was rhetorical.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.001
(groans)

23:28.406 --> 23:29.675
(sighs)

23:32.243 --> 23:34.780
(faucet creaking,
water running)

23:36.782 --> 23:39.285
SPIKE: Are you hurt?
You're not movin' so well.

23:40.819 --> 23:44.289
-Get out.
-We have to talk.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.927
-I really don't.
-Well, this isn't
just about you.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.863
As much
as you'd like it to be.

23:52.163 --> 23:54.701
You spoke. I listened.
Now leave.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.637
I'm sorry.

24:00.338 --> 24:03.609
Not that it matters anymore.
But I needed you to know that.

24:03.643 --> 24:07.579
-Why?
-'Cause I care about you.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.849
Then you might want
to try the not sleeping
with my friends.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.920
I didn't go to Anya for that.
I was looking for a spell.

24:13.952 --> 24:18.356
-You were gonna use
a spell on me?
-(sigh) It wasn't for you.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.460
I wanted something.

24:21.493 --> 24:25.297
Anything to make
this feeling stop.
I just wanted it to stop.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.572
(chuckles)
You should've let him kill me.

24:36.307 --> 24:39.045
-I couldn't do that.
-Why?

24:39.077 --> 24:42.280
-You know why.
-Because you love me.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.785
-No, I don't.
-Why do you keep
lying to yourself?

24:45.817 --> 24:50.056
How many times--
I have feelings for you.

24:50.088 --> 24:53.192
I do. But it's not love.

24:53.224 --> 24:55.694
I could never trust you enough
for it to be love.

24:55.728 --> 24:59.531
(laughs)
Trust is for old marrieds,
Buffy.

24:59.566 --> 25:02.233
Great love is wild,

25:02.268 --> 25:05.837
and passionate
and dangerous.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.674
It burns and consumes.

25:08.708 --> 25:11.577
Until there's nothing left.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.680
Love like that doesn't last.

25:13.712 --> 25:17.415
I know you feel like I do.
You don't have to hide
it anymore.

25:17.449 --> 25:21.053
-Spike, please stop this.
-Let yourself feel it.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.923
-No!
-You love me.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.525
-Ow, no. Stop it!
-You love me.

25:26.558 --> 25:30.829
Spike, stop! Ow!
What are you doing? Ow!

25:30.863 --> 25:33.700
Ow! Oh!
(grunts)
Let it go.

25:33.732 --> 25:37.002
-Let yourself love me.
-(grunting)

25:37.036 --> 25:40.372
Buffy. Buffy.
Spike, no!
Ow, I'm hurt!

25:40.405 --> 25:44.542
Ow! Don't! No!

25:44.576 --> 25:46.878
-(pained cries)
-(hisses)

25:49.981 --> 25:53.519
-Stop! Ow! Stop it, please!
-I knew you felt it...

25:53.551 --> 25:57.522
-when I was inside you.
-(grunting) No! No!

25:57.556 --> 26:00.759
(grunting, groaning)

26:00.792 --> 26:03.930
Please, please!
Spike, please stop--

26:03.962 --> 26:06.965
-You'll feel it again, Buffy.
-Please don't do this!

26:06.999 --> 26:09.669
-I'm gonna make you feel it!
-(screams) Stop!

26:17.308 --> 26:20.445
Ask me again why I could
never love you?

26:22.013 --> 26:25.151
-Buffy, my God, I didn't--
-Because I stopped you!

26:27.686 --> 26:30.355
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

26:46.471 --> 26:49.208
What are we doing here?
Somebody might recognize us.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.278
(scoffs)
This is great.

26:53.311 --> 26:56.481
We're risking everything
so that Charles Atlas
can get a date.

26:56.515 --> 27:00.352
He's gonna end up
getting us thrown into jail.
Or worse.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.990
-Maybe you and I should
think about--
-Warren's the boss.

27:04.022 --> 27:07.093
He's Picard.
You're Deanna Troi.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.461
Get used to the feeling,
Betazoid.

27:10.696 --> 27:13.199
The clothes and
the cars and the money,

27:13.231 --> 27:15.467
see, it's all just
window dressing.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.037
Baby, this is what's
really important.

27:18.069 --> 27:21.039
Two souls comin' together.
MAN:
Hey!

27:23.075 --> 27:25.877
She only
comes together with me.
So get lost, shrimp.

27:25.912 --> 27:29.280
Frankie?
Oh, my God,
is that you?

27:29.315 --> 27:33.484
How long has it been?
It's Warren.
Remember, Warren,

27:33.519 --> 27:35.354
gym class,
fifth period?

27:35.386 --> 27:37.856
You and your jock buddies used
to give me such a hard time.

27:37.890 --> 27:42.060
That thing with the underwear.
God, I thought
I'd never stop crying.

27:42.094 --> 27:45.832
Yeah, that was you?
Yeah, that was me.
But hey, no hard feelings.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.334
I mean, I know you were
just foolin' around,

27:48.366 --> 27:51.971
like I'm gonna be
with your girl
in about five minutes.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.708
What'd you say?
You heard me, meathead.
Take a walk.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.675
Oh, you're dead,
you little--

28:00.712 --> 28:02.181
This ain't high school.

28:03.214 --> 28:04.383
BOUNCER:
Frankie!

28:14.026 --> 28:15.894
Let's party!

28:19.198 --> 28:21.032
Oh, don't worry about
the tab now, ladies.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.835
It's on Daddy tonight.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.037
(toilet flushes)

28:27.705 --> 28:30.409
Don't worry, babies.
Daddy gonna give you some too.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.444
See now, I think
it's the daddy thing
that's throwin' her.

28:33.479 --> 28:36.015
Because incest?
Not that sexy.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.250
Oh, crap.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.586
So why don't we leave the ladies
with their impending nausea
and move the freak show outside.

28:40.618 --> 28:43.622
What do you say?
Okay. But let me
ask you somethin' first.

28:43.654 --> 28:46.125
You think maybe you could
put in a word for me
with that Anya chick?

28:46.157 --> 28:49.961
'Cause if she's taking it
from a vamp, I think
I might have a chance.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.233
No wonder
she's screwin' a dead guy.
You hit like a girl.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.135
Well, at least
I know how to get one.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.612
Let's see how popular you are
without a face.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.915
Warren,
we have to go.
We'll go when I'm ready.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.984
Hey, it's it's your call,
but we're, we're gonna miss
that thing...

29:13.019 --> 29:14.820
you wanted to do tonight
if we don't leave right now.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.155
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah.
(huffs)

29:17.189 --> 29:20.659
-It's your lucky night, chump.
-We just gonna
leave him there?

29:20.692 --> 29:23.095
-What if he sics
the Slayer on us?
-Bring her on.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.003
Buffy? I found Warren!

29:32.038 --> 29:34.105
Actually,
my face kinda found him.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.849
Is this what you call
not seein' Spike anymore?

29:47.819 --> 29:50.322
What did he do?
Did he hurt you?

29:51.990 --> 29:55.527
He tried.
He didn't--

29:55.560 --> 29:57.729
-Son of a bitch!
-Don't.

29:59.230 --> 30:02.268
Please, just don't.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.669
(door closing)

30:04.836 --> 30:07.338
Hey! I think we
finally have something.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.376
-What happened?
-Nothing.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.346
What'd you find out?

30:14.380 --> 30:17.884
We were able to decipher
pretty much everything,
except these.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.551
It isn't written
in any ancient language
we could identify.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.821
Hmph. It's Klingon.
They're, they're love poems.

30:23.855 --> 30:27.393
Which has nothing to do
with the insidious scheme
you're about to describe.

30:27.425 --> 30:30.296
What have you got for me
that doesn't rhyme?

30:30.328 --> 30:34.866
Oh, um, this.
It was filled with encoded
blueprints and schematics.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.469
To what?

30:37.502 --> 30:40.739
Um, banks,
armored car routes,
corporate vaults.

30:40.771 --> 30:44.343
-This is big.
-They're lookin' to score
some serious dinero.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.478
We don't think
they're planning
just one job.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.846
Spree, anyone?

30:48.881 --> 30:51.049
I, I can't cover
all these at once.
You don't have to.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.486
We think there's
one they may hit tonight.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.988
It's time sensitive.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.522
Be careful.

30:57.556 --> 31:01.527
-Warren's gone all Mighty Mouse.
Emphasis on the might.
-Good.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.063
Then I won't
have to hold back.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.567
(sobbing)
Please, stop it!

31:08.599 --> 31:12.337
No, stop, please!
Please, don't do this!
Please!

31:12.371 --> 31:14.440
Please, stop it!
Please!
Buffy?

31:28.453 --> 31:31.156
-I'm gonna make you feel it!
-(screams) No! Stop!

31:35.794 --> 31:39.065
Uh, knock, knock?
(chuckles)

31:39.097 --> 31:42.601
I was just
in the neighborhood,
so I thought, you know,

31:42.634 --> 31:45.037
there's a Knight Rider
marathon on the TV, so,

31:45.070 --> 31:47.272
and I got hot wings!

31:47.905 --> 31:49.441
What have I done?

31:53.945 --> 31:55.981
Why didn't I do it?

31:58.650 --> 32:01.086
(sigh)
What has she done to me?

32:01.119 --> 32:03.689
She done, who?

32:05.257 --> 32:08.794
Oh. Slayer, huh?

32:08.826 --> 32:11.863
Gosh. She break up
with you again?

32:13.098 --> 32:15.101
We were never together.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.501
Not really.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.106
She'd never
lower herself that far.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.343
She's a sweet girl, Spike.
But hey, whoo.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.478
Issues.
(chuckles)

32:26.511 --> 32:28.646
And no wonder,
with the whole...

32:28.680 --> 32:31.750
comin' back
from the grave,
and whatnot.

32:31.782 --> 32:35.086
Hey, I had this cousin
who got resurrected
by some kooky shaman.

32:35.121 --> 32:38.023
(chuckles)
Whoo, boy.
Was that a mess.

32:39.625 --> 32:43.194
-Why do I feel this way?
-Love's a funny thing.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.997
Is that what this is?

32:47.199 --> 32:48.567
I can feel it.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.304
Squirmin' in my head.

32:52.337 --> 32:54.873
-Love?
-The chip.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.346
Gnawing bits and chunks.

33:00.378 --> 33:04.482
Uh,
maybe a wet cloth?

33:06.585 --> 33:10.122
You know,
everything always
used to be so clear.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.358
Slayer, vampire.
Vampire kills Slayer.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.827
Sucks her dry.
Picks his teeth
with her bones.

33:17.695 --> 33:20.465
It's always been that way.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.367
I've tasted the
life of two Slayers.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.703
But with Buffy--

33:29.407 --> 33:32.411
It isn't supposed
to be this way!

33:34.846 --> 33:36.214
It's the chip!

33:38.049 --> 33:41.353
Steel and wires
and silicon!

33:41.386 --> 33:42.854
(sighs)

33:45.090 --> 33:47.025
It won't let me
be a monster.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.563
And I can't be a man.

33:53.298 --> 33:54.732
I'm nothing.

33:54.766 --> 33:58.269
Hey, come on now,
Mr. Negative.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.338
You never know what's
just around the corner.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.842
-Things change.
-Yeah, they do.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.644
(laughs)

34:09.780 --> 34:12.217
If you make them.

34:30.436 --> 34:33.405
All right,
that's the last one.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.873
Quite a haul, huh?
Always the biggest gate
of the year.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.809
-Yeah.
-Don't lose any.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.677
Yeah.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.416
Wanna grab a bite after?
I think Ruby's is still open.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.786
-(engine revving,
tires squealing)
-What the hell?

34:50.688 --> 34:52.291
GUARD:
There's something back there!

34:52.324 --> 34:55.460
I can't wait to get my hands
on his orbs.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.795
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be
givin' 'em up any second now.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.168
Hi! Is this your bank?

35:02.201 --> 35:04.936
'Cause if not,
there's gonna
be a fee for that.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.076
-(groans)
-I was wondering when
Super Bitch would show up.

35:11.108 --> 35:13.445
You really got a problem
with strong women, don't ya?

35:13.478 --> 35:15.213
Nothing I can't handle.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.655
You seem a little off.
Is this a bad day?

35:24.690 --> 35:26.625
It's gettin' better.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.706
-Is that all you got?
-(stones crumbling)

35:40.739 --> 35:42.740
ANDREW: No!

35:46.478 --> 35:48.880
There's two ways
this can end.
And right now,

35:48.914 --> 35:51.148
I'm thinkin'
they're both gonna hurt.

35:51.182 --> 35:53.751
-(stones clattering)
-I think you're right.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.824
What's the matter, baby?

35:59.858 --> 36:02.927
You never fight
a real man before?

36:25.516 --> 36:27.885
Wow.
That almost hurt, kitten.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.429
Kill her. Kill her!

36:40.532 --> 36:43.934
-You know who I am,
huh, Slayer?
-You're a murderer.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.570
Well that too.
But more to the point--

36:46.605 --> 36:48.039
I'm the guy
that beat you.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.677
And it's not
the muscles, baby.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.347
-It's the brains.
-I'll remember that when I
knock 'em clean out of your--

36:56.382 --> 36:59.918
-(gasps, gags)
-Oh, Sparky! I didn't
think ya had it in ya!

36:59.951 --> 37:03.489
Orbs.
Smash his orbs.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.264
Say good night, bitch.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.940
"Good night, bitch."

37:26.311 --> 37:28.614
You're nothing but
a sad little boy, Warren.

37:28.646 --> 37:32.318
But it's time you grow up
and pay for what you've done.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.753
Get away from me.
I swear to God
I'm gonna take you down,

37:35.853 --> 37:37.389
you piece of--

37:37.422 --> 37:38.423
(screams)

37:39.525 --> 37:41.827
Oh, come on.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.364
Well played, Slayer.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.768
God, why didn't I get
one of those?

37:50.802 --> 37:53.938
This round to you.
But the game's far from over.

37:58.108 --> 37:59.878
(sirens blaring)

38:03.681 --> 38:05.684
(police radio chatter)

38:14.360 --> 38:18.697
(sniffles) Jet packs.
You jerks were setting
me up to take the fall.

38:18.730 --> 38:22.132
He left me.
He flew away
and left me.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.780
Oh, God.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.449
The big house.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.885
How could he
do this to me?

38:39.918 --> 38:41.952
He promised we'd
be together, but...

38:41.987 --> 38:44.655
he was just
using me.

38:44.690 --> 38:48.159
He never really loved...
hanging out with us.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.528
(sobs)

38:55.934 --> 38:59.471
You think he'll
come back for us?
I mean,

38:59.505 --> 39:01.539
he wouldn't just
take off, would he?

39:07.512 --> 39:10.715
Get nice and comfy, Slayer.
I'll be back.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.885
And when I do,
things are gonna change.

39:26.764 --> 39:30.201
Hmph.
Hey, clothes.

39:30.235 --> 39:34.039
Better not
get used to 'em.
Mmm. Yes, ma'am.

39:37.976 --> 39:41.045
Mmm. Xander.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.516
Okay,
not quite the response
I was fishin' for.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.952
No, he's here.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.621
Think they're making up?

39:49.655 --> 39:53.257
I hope so.
That's the best part.

40:00.097 --> 40:02.300
Time for the spring poking
already?

40:04.802 --> 40:07.938
Just making sure
there are no more
evil Trio cameras.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.375
Or evil uno.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.744
The sinister, yet
addictive card game?

40:12.777 --> 40:16.815
Warren. Jonathan
and Andrew got clinked,

40:16.847 --> 40:19.250
but Warren pulled
a rocket man.

40:19.284 --> 40:23.688
You'll find him.
He won't be much good
without his friends.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.625
No, he won't.

40:38.836 --> 40:41.338
How did we get here?

40:42.673 --> 40:45.677
Scenic route.
Long drive.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.880
-And the past few weeks.
-I know.

40:54.018 --> 40:58.155
I thought I hit bottom,
but it hurt.

40:58.188 --> 41:00.791
That you didn't trust me
enough to tell me about Spike.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.063
It hurt.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.534
I'm sorry.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.737
I should've told you.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.206
Maybe you would have,
if I hadn't given you...

41:15.239 --> 41:18.643
so many reasons to think
I'd be an ass about it.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.478
Guess we've all done
a lot of things lately
we're not proud of.

41:23.313 --> 41:25.315
I think I've got you beat.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.719
Want to compare?

41:27.753 --> 41:29.755
Not so much.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.260
I don't know what I'd do...

41:37.829 --> 41:39.864
without you and Wil.

41:41.231 --> 41:43.768
Let's not find out.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.438
Oh...

41:49.173 --> 41:51.208
I love you.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.010
You know that,
right?

41:53.043 --> 41:54.579
-(footsteps)
-Buffy!

41:56.414 --> 41:58.650
You think you could
just do that to me?

41:58.684 --> 42:00.552
You think I'd let you
get away with that?

42:00.585 --> 42:03.420
(laughs)
Think again.

42:08.425 --> 42:11.996
-Your shirt.
-Tara?

42:12.030 --> 42:15.233
Sweet fancy Moses!
Where the hell did he--

42:15.266 --> 42:17.835
-Oh, God.
-Tara?
(sobbing)

42:17.869 --> 42:21.840
Baby? Baby, come on!
Get up!

42:21.873 --> 42:24.442
Oh, God. Buffy? Buffy?

42:25.543 --> 42:27.077
Buffy?

42:27.112 --> 42:28.713
No! No!

42:28.746 --> 42:30.547
No!

42:30.581 --> 42:33.284
(gasping sobs)

42:49.835 --> 42:52.804
(theme music playing)

43:14.925 --> 43:17.427
Grr! Arrgh!
