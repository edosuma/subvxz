10:07.750 --> 10:10.791
Yeaaah, my man.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.333

10:49.208 --> 10:52.041
(plane takes off)

10:56.166 --> 10:58.958
Before I bless the food,
I just wanna remind everyone

10:59.041 --> 11:01.666
of Psalm 127, Verse Three,

11:01.750 --> 11:05.375
which says,
"Children are a gift
from the Lord."

11:05.458 --> 11:08.000
So, as we move forward
from this baptism,

11:08.083 --> 11:10.916
let us remember that
Elijah Mustafa Walker

11:11.000 --> 11:15.416
has been gift-wrapped
in the most amazing
wrappin' paper there is...

11:15.500 --> 11:17.250
the blood of
the Lord and Savior.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.083
-Amen?
-All: Amen.

11:19.166 --> 11:22.041
Let me just get a quick photo
of Elijah, Mommy, and Daddy.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.708
Uncle Ronnie:
<i>Now, this is what</i>
<i>I love to see.</i>

11:27.791 --> 11:29.541
A Black father bein'
there for his son.

11:29.625 --> 11:30.833
Showin' up. Doin' it.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.375
Lawrence:
Thanks, Uncle Ronnie.
That means a lot, man.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.166
Shake my hand, son.

11:37.041 --> 11:40.125
-Oh, blessed me with a five.
-Uncle Ronnie: Uh-huh.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.875
-Thank you.
-Hey, you're welcome.

11:41.958 --> 11:44.625
I'm gonna go, uh, check
on my parents real quick.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.708
They call what we
did earlier a baptism?

11:46.791 --> 11:48.166
It was just
a couple droplets.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.708
I guess
his forehead
is saved,

11:49.791 --> 11:51.291
but what about
the rest of him?

11:51.375 --> 11:52.958
Condola had already
made plans, so--

11:53.041 --> 11:54.125
Oh, so she made an Evite,

11:54.208 --> 11:56.125
and you gave up
on your baby's soul.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.083
-Mom--
-I'm gonna take him
to Pastor Clarke

11:58.166 --> 11:59.791
for a full dip.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.166
-(laughing)
-Lawrence: Hey, what
y'all laughin' about?

12:02.250 --> 12:04.458
-How's my son doin'?
-He could use a little nap.

12:04.541 --> 12:06.375
A nap sounds good
right about now.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.458
Oh yeah, I'm sure
you're so tired.

12:08.541 --> 12:10.875
Yeah, I saw him
eatin' them cheese
quiches earlier.

12:10.958 --> 12:13.500
You know, dairy
always wears out
a Walker.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.583
Uh, you know what, I was just,
uh, thinkin' about the holidays.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.291
Wouldn't it be fun if we
all got together again?

12:18.375 --> 12:20.750
You know, your family could
spend some time with Jah,
and then my side.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.250
I could take him off
your hands for a week.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.916
-He'll be old enough by then.
-Oh, a week?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
-Yeah.
-That's like a year.

12:26.083 --> 12:29.500
Nah, it's-- it's
actually a week.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.666
I mean, we could talk
about it as it gets closer.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.833
-We can check back in.
-Okay, cool.

12:34.916 --> 12:37.208
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I want my parents to spend
some time with him, too.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.666
My dad wants to teach
him how to swim.

12:38.750 --> 12:39.916
He thinks he's
got floater's feet.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.166
Yeah, yeah.
Just toss him
in the deep end.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.500
It's the only
way to find out.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.166
(softly):
Uncle Ronnie, Uncle Ronnie.
Yeah, come here for a second.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.458
You need another five dollars?

12:48.541 --> 12:50.875
(plane takes off)

12:50.958 --> 12:53.958
Guys, a fight over office space
can't be what breaks us.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.916
So what it's not in the city?
I think you're still
gonna love it.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.333
Man (on phone):
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>We'll make it work.</i>

12:58.416 --> 13:00.750
Awesome.
That's what I like to hear.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.250
Let's sign the lease tomorrow.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.291
Give me a call if you guys
have any questions.
I'm here anytime.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.500
<i>Okay. Appreciate it.</i>

13:05.583 --> 13:07.833
-All right, bye.
<i>-All right, take care.</i>

13:11.708 --> 13:13.083
(phone dings)

13:19.791 --> 13:21.708
(exhales)

13:21.791 --> 13:22.875
(phone dings)

13:27.916 --> 13:29.833
Let's show Mama,
let's show Mama, aye!

13:29.916 --> 13:32.541
Look, Mama, I belong
to the streets now.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.375
Aye, oh, pop it, pop it.

13:35.458 --> 13:38.333
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.125
I just-- I know you
already hate him.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.208
Are you serious?
(sucks teeth)

13:44.291 --> 13:46.500
Ashy Larry strikes again.

13:46.583 --> 13:49.958
-He said he had to work.
-Well, who can work these
kinks out my neck, okay?

13:50.041 --> 13:51.541
-'Cause he ruined
our massage day.
-I know.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.750
And I was really lookin'
forward to Big Hands Kyle.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.458
-And his thick thumbs.
-The way that Lawrence
can just pop in every

13:56.541 --> 13:58.416
couple of hours and play
peek-a-boo, then split, girl?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.166
He ain't nothin'
but an uncle.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.958
-Kira.
-No, I'm serious.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.083
You better than me
because, girl, I would
go the fuck off.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.875
I bust windows.
We already know about
that one situation.

14:08.958 --> 14:11.708
It's okay. I will just
have to reschedule

14:11.791 --> 14:13.916
for 18 years from now.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.625
Girl, shut up.
You go and I'll watch Eli.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.125
We gotta practice
his Crip Walk anyway.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.583

Wow.

15:40.083 --> 15:43.375
Kelli: I know, right?
Shrimp does taste better cold.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.625
-Oh, one second.
-Hey, Kel. What's good?

15:46.708 --> 15:50.208
Wow, Lawrence and Condola.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.541
-Hi.
-Hey!

15:51.625 --> 15:54.875
And that is a full baby
with both your faces.

15:54.958 --> 15:55.958
Wow.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.291
Well, welcome
to the celebration
of Simone.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.791
Thank you.
And I am living
for this lady tux.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.458
-Oh, well, thank you.
-Well, you haven't
seen the best part.

16:03.541 --> 16:05.250
Oh my gosh.
Y'all match?

16:05.333 --> 16:06.708
Too cute.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.125
Her obsession with
my child is unsettling,

16:09.208 --> 16:10.958
but, you know,
free babysitting.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.291
Hey, y'all got Peppa Pig?

16:12.375 --> 16:14.041
No, no, no.
That's Pepper Pig

16:14.125 --> 16:15.625
with a hard "R."

16:15.708 --> 16:17.000
You know, there
was copyright issues,

16:17.083 --> 16:18.708
and the snout's a little off,
but that's my cousin

16:18.791 --> 16:21.083
Tyrell up in there-- Tyrell!

16:21.166 --> 16:23.000
Get off your phone, okay?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.750
You gotta suspend
the children's disbelief.

16:24.833 --> 16:28.125
-C'mon!
-Condola, let me show you
where you can put your things.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.333
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye-bye-bye.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.000
-Kelli.
-Lawrence.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.333
-It's been a minute.
-Yeah.

16:35.416 --> 16:36.916
Everything-- Everything good?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.166
Oh, me? I'm good.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.666
You might've heard I died
nine months ago, but--

16:39.750 --> 16:40.666
-Wait, what?
-She didn't.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.041
I came back
just like Daft Punk.

16:42.125 --> 16:45.416
-Better. Faster. Stronger.
-She quit drinkin'.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.416
Okay, cool.
That's good for you.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.000
-Thank you.
-Lawrence: Yeah.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.416
And how's... everybody else?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.541
Everyone I associate
with is thriving.

16:55.625 --> 16:59.875
In abundance... Limitless.

16:59.958 --> 17:04.083
Okay, cool. That's--
that's great to hear.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.041
(feedback squeals)

17:06.125 --> 17:09.250
All right, y'all.
Gather 'round. Gather 'round.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.458
I, myself, may
not be partaking,

17:11.541 --> 17:15.166
but by all means,
grab an adult<i> boisson,</i>

17:15.250 --> 17:17.875
and join me in a toast.

17:17.958 --> 17:20.125
Now, I don't like children.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.375
I never have.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.541
Their small features
and stilted movements

17:23.625 --> 17:25.500
remind me of tiny demons.

17:26.458 --> 17:27.583
But not Simone.

17:27.666 --> 17:31.750
This little girl means
so, so much to me.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.541
Baby girl's gonna be a force
when she grows up.

17:34.625 --> 17:38.166
And I am so proud
to be her Godmother.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.041
Happy Birthday, Simone,

17:40.125 --> 17:42.875
an angel amongst demons.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.541
-Cheers.
-All: Cheers.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.333
Oh, he's hungry.
Let me get him.

17:47.416 --> 17:48.458
No, no, no.
I got it.

17:48.541 --> 17:49.833
-Are you sure?
-I got it. Yeah, yeah.

17:49.916 --> 17:52.041
-Kelli: There she is.
-Say "Thank you, Auntie Kelli."

17:52.125 --> 17:53.833
Hey! Hi.

17:53.916 --> 17:56.000
Let's go eat. Let's go eat.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.208
-Say bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.208
Kelli: It's called
Sympathetic Lactating.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.291
I can't help it.
She's around me.
I have to feed her.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.333
I think Pepper Pig
might be roasting.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.833
Kelli:
Son of a--

18:08.916 --> 18:10.041
Tyrell!

18:13.083 --> 18:15.375
-Are you serious?
-Tyrell: What up, cousin?

18:15.458 --> 18:18.875
-Come smoke with me.
-Nigga, you know
I'm already high.

18:18.958 --> 18:21.541
Little man was hungry.
Look at that smile.

18:21.625 --> 18:22.833
What's that on his face?

18:22.916 --> 18:25.375
Oh, um, gave him somethin'
off the kids' snack table.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.791
Really just an assortment
of mushes, but he loved it.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.958
What? We-- we haven't
introduced solids yet.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.708
Okay, well, you know,
the doctor said we can do it

18:31.791 --> 18:32.916
anytime after four months, so.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.666
Right, but I
decided to wait.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.041
There's a way
to introduce
new foods.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.250
What if he
was allergic?

18:37.333 --> 18:38.958
Oh, is it that deep?
He's fine and now

18:39.041 --> 18:40.625
we know that
he loves carrots.

18:40.708 --> 18:41.791
You should've checked
in with me, Lawrence.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.083
Why are you being
so dramatic?

18:43.166 --> 18:44.875
Why is Mommy being
so dramatic? Why?

18:44.958 --> 18:45.958
Is this funny to you?

18:46.041 --> 18:48.000
No, I did it,
it happened, and he's fine.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.375
-Give me my baby.
-Can you calm down?

18:49.458 --> 18:50.750
-Just give me--
-Can you just calm down?

18:50.833 --> 18:52.708
(shouts):
Can you just calm down?!

18:52.791 --> 18:54.333
Condola:
Give me the baby.

18:54.416 --> 18:57.375
Hey, bruh. Can you help me
move some boxes real quick?

18:57.458 --> 18:59.708
-Hey, buddy. Hi.
-Hey, baby.

18:59.791 --> 19:01.666
-(baby whines)
-Hi.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.166
(sighs)

19:04.250 --> 19:05.875
Where these boxes at, bruh?

19:05.958 --> 19:08.833
Oh, ain't no boxes, bruh.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.166
Bro, I'm tired
of her bullshit, man.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.500
Tryna make me look
like I'm a bad father
in front of everybody?

19:13.583 --> 19:17.250
C'mon, she's always
on some petty,
controllin' bullshit.

19:17.333 --> 19:20.000
And? So you gotta act out?

19:20.083 --> 19:22.083
I promise you, this is not
how you wanna do things.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.333
Bruh, I am tired
of her acting like
she's the only parent,

19:24.416 --> 19:26.166
like she's the only
one who can take
care of him.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.250
This is all too negative.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.333
You know, Elijah
can feel that energy.

19:29.416 --> 19:30.833
Y'all need to learn
to communicate.

19:30.916 --> 19:32.500
I mean, Tiff and I
had our issues,

19:32.583 --> 19:34.416
but we-- we had
to decide to be a team.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.708
Y'all are married, all right?

19:35.791 --> 19:37.375
Our situations
are not the same.

19:37.458 --> 19:38.708
There's niggas out
here not even tryin'

19:38.791 --> 19:40.166
to take care
of their kids,

19:40.250 --> 19:41.416
and I'm here,
all right?

19:41.500 --> 19:44.416
I'm doin' everything I can
to make this shit work,

19:44.500 --> 19:47.250
-and it's never good enough.
-Okay, look, I hear you,

19:47.333 --> 19:50.041
but I-- I promise you...

19:50.125 --> 19:53.583
the last thing you wanna
be doin' is addin' stress
to the situation.

19:53.666 --> 19:56.875
All right, whatever, man.
I'll-- I'll figure it out.

19:56.958 --> 19:58.791
Yeah, I know you will.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.333
Now, let's get back
to my baby's party

20:00.416 --> 20:03.541
before Pepper Pig
turns my house into
"Pineapple Express."

20:04.791 --> 20:06.583
That's what's
happenin' right now.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.666

He's okay.
It's just his fussy hour.

Aw, what's wrong?
You mad Daddy a little late?

22:17.375 --> 22:20.083
Huh? You ready to go?
Yo, you got his bag packed?

22:20.166 --> 22:21.416
Yeah, but what
about the car seat?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.791
I got the one you told me to.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.041

I mean, him staying overnight

I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.208
What're you talkin' about?
We talked about this.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.708
-It's walking distance.
-I know, but I'm just
not comfortable with him

22:51.791 --> 22:53.333
going with you
when he's like this.

22:53.416 --> 22:55.250
Jesus Christ,
why do you keep actin'

22:55.333 --> 22:57.291
like I can't handle this.
What is wrong with you?

22:57.375 --> 22:58.750
I don't trust you!

23:00.750 --> 23:02.291
Are you fuckin' serious?

23:02.375 --> 23:04.250
Condola, stop actin' like
I'm a fuckin' stranger.

23:04.333 --> 23:07.333
-I'm his father.
-And you're barely ever here.
And you never check in.

23:07.416 --> 23:09.125
Not about his
swimming, or food,

23:09.208 --> 23:11.666
and you don't even give me
more than three hours' notice
when you're not coming.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.000
I have a job, okay?
I check in when I can.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.375

needed something?

23:15.458 --> 23:16.750

to ask Tiffany to take

-me and Eli to urgent care.

tell me that?
I could've--

23:19.708 --> 23:21.041
What were
you gonna do?

23:21.125 --> 23:22.541
Not fly down on a Tuesday?

fixed everything.

All right, look,
I'm tryin' here, okay?

23:28.250 --> 23:29.916
-This shit is hard for me, too.
-Oh, really?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.333
-Yeah.
-What part is hard for you?

23:31.416 --> 23:33.041
All the free time,
or the full night's sleep?

23:33.125 --> 23:35.208
-Which part?
-Shut up!

23:35.291 --> 23:38.208
You never talk to me.
You never even pretended
to give me a chance.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.333
I gave you a chance,
and you moved away!

23:40.416 --> 23:42.375
Yeah, to take
a job I already had.

23:42.458 --> 23:44.958
Before you blew my life up!

23:45.041 --> 23:46.166
-Blew your life up?
-Yeah.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.875
You are not a fucking
victim, Lawrence.

23:47.958 --> 23:49.458
Well, you made
a decision without me,

23:49.541 --> 23:52.625
and now you're trying
to use it as an excuse
to keep him from me.

23:52.708 --> 23:54.375
Wow, you know what?

23:54.458 --> 23:57.000
This half-in, half-out shit.
It isn't working for me.

-He's not going with you.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.125
-Give me my son.
-No!

24:00.208 --> 24:01.291
I'm tired of this,
all right?

24:01.375 --> 24:02.791
I'm not doin' this
with you anymore.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.083
We don't have to talk.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.500
But just know I'mma
do whatever it takes

24:05.583 --> 24:08.583

with or without you.
