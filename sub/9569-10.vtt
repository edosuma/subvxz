00:00.257 --> 00:01.637
Grace wouldn't be dead

00:01.680 --> 00:05.853
if you hadn't been fucking Matty
and every boy you get your hands on.

00:06.881 --> 00:08.599
What about little bummer boy?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.039
He's away.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.719
Oh, so now you're back in my life.
Is that how it works?

00:13.720 --> 00:16.158
'We'll go places
with your baby, Mini,'

00:16.160 --> 00:19.079
and then she'll know
how much you love her.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.199
You can't fix yourself
by fixing this.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.720
I came back for her, Nick.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.598
You were dumped fucking months ago.

00:25.599 --> 00:27.560
I'm not the one who got it
all wrong, little brother.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.640
Nick!

00:31.840 --> 00:33.720
You're going to be
an auntie, Gracie.

Dad.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.920
Dad!

02:08.979 --> 02:11.300
Franky, you home, darling?

02:31.380 --> 02:32.820
'The weather's about to turn

02:32.821 --> 02:35.620
'and all the bronzed babes

'Won't last long.'

02:46.820 --> 02:49.179
Hear that, Mins?

02:49.180 --> 02:52.540
You've got to get better.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.420
Before the rain comes.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.020
Do you mind?

03:21.020 --> 03:23.460
Not if you roll me one too.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.739
You didn't choose
a great night to run away.

03:27.740 --> 03:31.260
I didn't exactly plan it, did I?

03:31.260 --> 03:33.540
No point in planning
anything, if you ask me.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.099
Why?

03:37.100 --> 03:40.340
Everything happens
for a reason, in my opinion.

03:40.340 --> 03:43.380
Sounds like hippy
bullshit, in my opinion.

03:50.140 --> 03:52.540
So, where you running to?

03:58.420 --> 04:01.739
Is there someone out there?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.900
No, there's not.

04:03.900 --> 04:07.660
I bet there is cos there's
always a silver lining.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.420
'This is Franky.
I'm not here right now.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.100
'Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.'

04:22.860 --> 04:24.539
She's in trouble.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.899
Yeah.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.419
So what we going to do about it?

04:28.420 --> 04:32.499
We aren't going to do anything.
She's my girlfriend.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.339
Matty, she's been into me
for months. You can't change that.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.299
She's been fucking you for months.
There's a difference.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.979
Back off, Matty.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.499
Not until she's told me.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.620
Told you what?

04:42.620 --> 04:43.700
That she doesn't love me.

04:43.701 --> 04:47.580
Fine. We'll go and find her.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.900
How exactly?

04:52.940 --> 04:54.820
You can track her?

04:54.820 --> 04:57.100
I registered her phone
to my account.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.699
OK.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.699
Where are you going?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.940
Birmingham.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.420
What?

05:41.020 --> 05:42.779
You're Mavis Williams.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.500
I'm Franky Fitzgerald.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.740
I was adopted five years ago.
You were my social worker.

05:47.741 --> 05:49.820
I don't remember you.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.220
Yes, you do.

05:53.660 --> 05:56.660
I'm looking for my mum.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.659
You know, I hated it
when you visited.

06:05.660 --> 06:09.059
My foster parents would spend hours
ripping all the knots out of my hair

06:09.060 --> 06:14.460
and filling it with sparkly bows
to try and make me look happy.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.300
You were so pretty.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.100
Are you going to help me find my mum?

06:25.420 --> 06:26.820
It's against the rules.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.580
Fuck the rules.

06:36.780 --> 06:39.339
You loved me

06:39.340 --> 06:42.299
and then you just fucked off.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.939
They reassigned me.

06:45.940 --> 06:48.940
I had no choice.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.260
You owe me.

06:53.260 --> 06:56.140
If I had kept anything
in my files to make sure...

06:59.620 --> 07:02.620
to make sure you'd be all right,

07:02.620 --> 07:05.500
I couldn't be the one to show you.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.499
I have to go to the bathroom.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.180
My bladder.

07:13.180 --> 07:15.900
It isn't what it was.

07:57.300 --> 08:02.740
There's a glittery gold dress here
with your name written all over it.

08:02.740 --> 08:05.860
It's low cut to suit your new rack.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.259
Hey! Um...

08:13.260 --> 08:14.859
Shelley called me.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.259
OK, cool.

08:16.260 --> 08:19.740
Coolio.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.900
Cool beans.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.140
Big shopping list?

08:30.380 --> 08:31.540
Yeah.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.780
How am I meant to apologise
when she won't even talk to me?

08:38.900 --> 08:42.140
Probably best
just to wait for a bit really.

08:47.220 --> 08:49.259
Tell her I was here,

08:49.260 --> 08:51.420
and that I hope she feels better.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.940
Yeah, I will.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.500
Hello?

10:26.740 --> 10:28.700
Almost...

10:50.580 --> 10:51.740
What the fuck are we doing?

11:05.140 --> 11:08.940
Hello? Who's here?

11:13.820 --> 11:16.179
Don't hit me. Jesus.

11:16.180 --> 11:19.060
What you doing in my house?

11:19.060 --> 11:21.820
It was my mum's house...

11:24.180 --> 11:26.939
Her name is Maria Townsend...

11:26.940 --> 11:28.819
Do you know where she is?

11:28.820 --> 11:34.820
Oh, my God... Oh, Christ!

11:34.820 --> 11:36.660
Who are you?

11:39.660 --> 11:44.180
Don't you remember me, Franky?

11:44.180 --> 11:45.460
You're my sister...

11:48.100 --> 11:50.380
Well, do you remember me?

11:52.980 --> 11:57.099
I came home from school one day,
you weren't here any more...

11:57.100 --> 11:59.059
I don't really know what happened.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.340
You don't know what happened?

12:01.340 --> 12:02.940
I was eight, Franky.

12:04.860 --> 12:06.939
I asked, later on,
but she never spoke about it.

12:06.940 --> 12:10.380
Well, she's going to have to speak
about it now.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.660
No, I don't think so. She's dead.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.299
I'm sorry?

12:18.300 --> 12:21.219
Shit. I shouldn't have just...

12:21.220 --> 12:26.140
She died, Franky.
A while ago.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.300
Why?

12:28.900 --> 12:29.898
What did she...?

12:29.899 --> 12:30.980
What do you think?

12:30.981 --> 12:33.180
She had too much shit in her life.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.700
She was crap.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.580
I have to sell this house,
but nobody wants it.

12:40.740 --> 12:44.860
So I come her and I sit.
It reminds me not to fuck up.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.180
Do you want to come in?

13:48.420 --> 13:49.979
Do you live here by yourself?

13:49.980 --> 13:51.099
Uh-huh.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.500
There's a spare bedroom
through there,

13:53.500 --> 13:54.940
but it's more of a cupboard really.

13:57.980 --> 14:00.299
Why didn't you come and find me?

14:00.300 --> 14:04.979
Why? You were adopted. You had
a peachy little life going on.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.619
How do you know that?

14:06.620 --> 14:10.219
We're better of without her.
All she did was hurt people...

14:10.220 --> 14:12.459
Did she hurt you too, Clara?

14:12.460 --> 14:17.739
Don't! OK! I don't know you.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.379
Yes you do.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.499
You know me better
than anyone in this world.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.659
I just don't remember,
which is hardly fair.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.139
Fair!

14:25.140 --> 14:27.260
So, I need some stuff from you.
All right?

14:27.260 --> 14:28.380
Fine.

14:30.580 --> 14:31.860
What would you like to know?

14:31.861 --> 14:35.459
The smell of her vomit
after a three day bender?

14:35.460 --> 14:38.699
Or the times I'd come home from
school to find her passed out,

14:38.700 --> 14:40.979
coked off her head
with my piggy bank empty?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.819
All the meaningless sorrys
and shit promises?

14:43.820 --> 14:45.820
How can I help you here!?

14:45.820 --> 14:47.940
Maybe you should've
looked after her better!

14:53.380 --> 14:54.940
I'm sorry.

14:54.940 --> 14:56.380
This was a mistake. Wasn't it?

14:56.381 --> 14:57.459
No.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.939
I have to go to work.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.419
Do what you want,
freshen up before you go.

15:02.420 --> 15:03.459
Please.

15:03.460 --> 15:05.339
Let's not do this too ourselves.

15:05.340 --> 15:07.300
Neither of us can take it.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.300
Clara.

16:15.660 --> 16:16.820
'Franky?'

16:16.820 --> 16:18.660
How did you find me?

16:20.300 --> 16:22.260
'I tracked your phone. OK?
I'm sorry.'

16:22.261 --> 16:24.300
What's he doing here?

16:25.700 --> 16:28.260
'We need to decide some
stuff Franks.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.580
'You can't run away from this.'

16:33.060 --> 16:34.220
Fuck.

16:34.220 --> 16:38.580
Franky! Franky! Franky!

16:55.900 --> 16:57.940
No silver lining?

17:29.820 --> 17:31.060
Feeling better?

17:31.061 --> 17:36.740
Yeah, I suppose.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.299
I didn't dream it all, did I?

17:42.300 --> 17:47.739
In my experience girl.
You've almost never dreamed it.

17:47.740 --> 17:52.019
What the fuck? Why are we...

17:52.020 --> 17:54.420
Why the fuck are we here?

17:54.420 --> 17:55.820
Woah, woah, calm down there.

17:55.821 --> 17:57.380
I never told you to bring me here!

17:57.380 --> 17:58.940
Where else was I going to take you?

17:58.941 --> 18:01.459
I drive between Birmingham
and Bristol. That's the deal.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.259
I want to get out. Let me out.

18:03.260 --> 18:06.180
Whatever it is girl. You cannot
run away from it for ever.

18:06.180 --> 18:09.380
Yeah? FUCKING watch me!

18:26.740 --> 18:28.380
Ah, fucking hell.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.900
What's your name?

18:31.900 --> 18:34.020
Franky.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.540
How is she?

19:27.541 --> 19:30.099
Bit late for that, isn't it?

19:30.100 --> 19:32.339
I really need to speak to her.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.859
No, you need to speak
to Nick and Matty.

19:34.860 --> 19:37.940
You know, the boys you've been
mugging off since last summer?

19:37.940 --> 19:40.140
What, so I need you permission
to be here, do I?

19:41.580 --> 19:43.939
Listen, you sarky bitch.

19:43.940 --> 19:45.660
Just because your life's fucked up,

19:45.743 --> 19:47.763
it doesn't give you the right
to fuck up everyone else's.

19:47.783 --> 19:50.002
I didn't ask anybody
to fall in love me.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.980
No, but you let them,
didn't you Franky?

19:51.981 --> 19:55.300
And then you pissed off. As you do.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.260
Oh, give it a rest,
you drama queen.

19:57.261 --> 19:59.740
You've been fucking
everyone over all year.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.540
Stop it, Liv. She's crying.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.380
How long have you been awake?

20:12.900 --> 20:15.219
I'm having a baby, Liv.

20:15.220 --> 20:18.299
It doesn't matter
who fucks who over.

20:18.300 --> 20:23.539
Don't you understand. Grace would
still be here if she hadn't...

20:23.540 --> 20:25.100
Being a bitch doesn't help us.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.500
Tell HER that.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.660
The moment I met you,
I knew you'd be trouble.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.780
You're need to sort your shit
out there, Franks,

20:59.780 --> 21:04.700
before our lives change,
and we're not together any more.

21:53.060 --> 21:55.420
Morning, chick.
What you doing home?

21:57.100 --> 22:00.020
I'm not really home, am I?

22:00.020 --> 22:05.180
Hey, moody, what's up?

22:13.420 --> 22:18.299
What am I meant to do without you?
Just fuck off, Thailand.

22:18.300 --> 22:22.419
Fuck off the lady boys, and ping pong
shows and full moon parties.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.939
Stay here.

22:24.940 --> 22:27.140
With me.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.700
I can't do that, babe.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.140
Well, fuck off then.

22:38.780 --> 22:41.100
Bit melodramatic.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.700
Well I can't stay here any more,
can I?

22:42.701 --> 22:44.300
Where you going to go?

22:44.300 --> 22:46.700
Fuck knows. I don't belong anywhere.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.059
Well...

22:53.060 --> 22:55.659
take me to uni with you, then.

22:55.660 --> 22:57.379
Smuggle me in.

22:57.380 --> 23:00.180
If I go. If I get the grades.
If I get a grant.

23:00.180 --> 23:01.780
If you grow some balls?

23:06.420 --> 23:09.700
And what if they don't want me?
I've got no best friend,

23:09.700 --> 23:11.820
no boyfriend and now, no you.

23:23.700 --> 23:27.259
That was the beautiful thing
about Grace,

23:27.260 --> 23:30.139
no matter what you did,

23:30.140 --> 23:32.819
she'd always be your friend.

23:32.820 --> 23:36.779
Hey, hey, no tears, Malone.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.379
All right? We've still got
one big blow-out

23:39.380 --> 23:41.579
and my send-offs
are nothing but epic.

23:41.580 --> 23:44.459
I can't be bothered with tonight.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.219
I'm not coming.

23:46.220 --> 23:49.699
What?!
You can't bail. You're my date.

23:49.700 --> 23:53.059
No, Alex, I'm just a fag hag.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.979
You're so much more
than that, Liv...

23:55.980 --> 23:58.060
You're my sexy fag bangle.

23:58.060 --> 24:00.420
Bastard!

24:10.740 --> 24:12.659
It will be OK, Liv.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.379
No, it won't.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.060
Yes, it will.

24:16.060 --> 24:18.140
No, it won't.

24:21.180 --> 24:23.299
It will.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.660
Fuck off, Alex.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.460
Oh, man.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.500
Whoo!

25:31.500 --> 25:35.420
Hey, buddy, I bought you beer.

25:35.420 --> 25:37.340
Cheers. Buddy.

25:38.740 --> 25:40.020
So...

25:40.020 --> 25:41.940
I need a favour.

25:45.060 --> 25:46.620
You want me to harbour
a known criminal?

25:46.719 --> 25:47.670
I'm not a criminal.

25:47.741 --> 25:49.339
You fucking are.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.219
I need you to look after him,
cos I fucking hate the guy,

25:53.220 --> 25:57.419
but he's got nowhere to go
and Dad's getting suspicious.

25:57.420 --> 25:59.300
I have never been more grateful
to be an only child.

25:59.365 --> 26:01.045
Please, Rich. Do it for me.

26:01.581 --> 26:03.140
I am here, you know.

26:03.140 --> 26:04.260
Shut up Matty.

26:05.580 --> 26:06.979
Yeah. Stay.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.979
My parents
aren't back for a week.

26:09.980 --> 26:13.180
Thanks, dude, I really
appreciate it. Don't we, Matty?

26:13.180 --> 26:16.660
Hey, hello!

26:20.860 --> 26:22.140
Yay, Alo's here.

26:24.860 --> 26:28.500
Bitches. How are we all today?

26:29.860 --> 26:31.299
Cool.

26:31.300 --> 26:35.340
Just popped in to drop your ticket
off for Alex's shindig tonight.

26:35.340 --> 26:39.780
He said ours are free cos,
you know, we're amazeballs.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.820
Erm, me and the wifey
are going to have to bail.

26:43.820 --> 26:45.300
No, you said she was fine?

26:45.301 --> 26:47.300
Yeah, but a pool party
full of smash heads

26:47.301 --> 26:48.859
is no place for my unborn baby.

26:48.860 --> 26:51.540
But it's our leaving party.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.020
Yeah, but I'm not leaving though.
I'm having a baby.

26:54.021 --> 26:58.859
I'm having a fucking baby!

26:58.860 --> 27:02.500
How batshit crazy is that?

27:02.500 --> 27:04.060
Nick, here's yours, plus one.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.300
You're not welcome.

27:12.780 --> 27:14.139
What, again?

27:14.140 --> 27:15.940
Fuck's sake!

27:15.940 --> 27:17.500
Chill out, man.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.580
Why does he do that?

27:24.060 --> 27:26.780
Right. Looks like it's just
me and you.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.900
You want a spliff?

27:45.580 --> 27:47.620
Thanks for this.

27:51.260 --> 27:53.940
And sorry, Rich...

27:56.340 --> 27:58.980
I should have stayed with her.

28:02.860 --> 28:04.140
I'm really sorry.

28:04.141 --> 28:06.500
It's OK. Grace says it's cool.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.540
Grace says what?

28:11.540 --> 28:12.780
She says just forget it.

28:15.140 --> 28:15.820
But I don't...

28:15.821 --> 28:17.140
She's here all the time.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.500
Fancy a beer?

28:40.940 --> 28:43.259
'Hello...?'

28:43.260 --> 28:46.139
Stupid bitch shouldn't
go down there...

28:46.140 --> 28:48.259
Nope.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.019
'Who's there? Grandpa Joe,
is that you?'

28:51.020 --> 28:54.460
Now they're going to jump
her naked ass,

28:54.460 --> 28:59.780
hang her upside down
and drain her blood.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.539
Ooh, God!

29:02.540 --> 29:05.140
Oh, yeah.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.580
Oh, yeah, yeah.

29:08.980 --> 29:14.340
Well, you know, who wants
a party when we can watch

29:14.340 --> 29:16.900
some well choreographed
torture instead?

29:28.460 --> 29:32.899
Ladies, I've got good news.

29:32.900 --> 29:37.859
Your Fairy Gynaecologist has said
that you can go to the ball.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.059
Farmboy...

29:39.060 --> 29:43.660
For one hour. No drugs,
no dancing, no blackberry shots.

29:43.660 --> 29:46.540
Just love, sweet love.

29:50.940 --> 29:52.780
Thank you.

29:58.260 --> 30:01.699
Your mum said this one
was your favourite.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.979
Aww...

30:03.980 --> 30:08.580
But I thought, you know,
just as a back-up, I'd bring this.

30:08.580 --> 30:14.100
Yeah, that's not bad, Biggus Dickus.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.580
Are you coming, Franks?

32:08.580 --> 32:11.180
Fucker, open!

32:11.180 --> 32:14.220
For Chrissakes, Franky.
Stop running away from it.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.700
You look like a right old disaster.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.940
Tell me what to do, Gracie.

32:46.020 --> 32:50.380
Life's fragile, Franky,
you need to stop running,

32:50.380 --> 32:52.780
or you're never really living
at all. OK?

32:56.220 --> 33:00.620
Just stop being a crazy bitch.
Just be Franky.

33:01.740 --> 33:04.180
Tell the truth
and all will be hunky dory.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.780
Do it now...

33:13.780 --> 33:15.980
- Franky?
- Franky, we need to talk to you.

33:18.860 --> 33:20.460
No. Fucking stop!

33:22.540 --> 33:24.939
You want the truth, right?

33:24.940 --> 33:27.420
Yeah, that would be good, Franks.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.740
I love you...

33:30.860 --> 33:32.300
both.

33:34.860 --> 33:38.740
I know that I made some mistakes.

33:40.140 --> 33:44.300
Matty, you have things
you need to do.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.140
I'm not ready.

33:48.140 --> 33:53.820
You don't need me to tell you
how to stop fucking up your life.

33:56.580 --> 33:58.260
And Nick...

34:00.300 --> 34:01.659
you can't fix me.

34:01.660 --> 34:03.139
I know.

34:03.140 --> 34:06.940
I can't help it, Franks.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.900
Can we not sort something out here?

34:11.980 --> 34:15.259
Everything's coming to an end.

34:15.260 --> 34:18.018
And it's fucking scary.

34:18.020 --> 34:21.580
We're all going to have to leave
somehow.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.540
Don't end it with us. Please.

34:30.340 --> 34:34.219
I'm just the way for you
to love each other.

34:54.060 --> 34:56.179
Aren't we going after her?

34:57.620 --> 35:00.900
Sit down, you twat.
Let's get fucked.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.940
Nick, I...

35:09.140 --> 35:10.100
Yeah?

35:15.620 --> 35:17.540
Have I ever told you I love you?

35:22.180 --> 35:23.940
Every day, mate.

35:26.140 --> 35:27.460
Every day since we were born.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.500
It's nice drive down here.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.580
Your dad says I should do it
more often.

37:39.260 --> 37:43.620
Bit early. Didn't realise you were
such lightweights in Bristol.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.300
I just wanted to know why.

37:50.540 --> 37:53.420
Why she gave me up.

37:55.780 --> 37:58.540
What is it that's wrong with me?

38:03.820 --> 38:04.980
It's all right.

38:04.981 --> 38:08.660
Everything's going to be all right.

38:08.660 --> 38:14.260
I promise.
Everything's going to be all right.

38:31.660 --> 38:33.819
Better get back
to the missus, man.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.819
Yeah, man.
I got no problem with that.

38:37.820 --> 38:39.019
No?

38:39.020 --> 38:40.460
No.

38:40.460 --> 38:42.780
I think she fucking loves me.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.300
How bad can it be?

38:49.060 --> 38:50.500
We did it, Alo.

38:52.180 --> 38:53.500
We got there.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.300
We lost our virginities...

38:57.740 --> 38:58.860
fell in love...

39:00.100 --> 39:02.340
and actually had
a pretty damn good time.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.820
That we did.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.060
That we did.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.300
Breakfast?

39:19.020 --> 39:21.340
Here's to our last night of freedom.

39:24.740 --> 39:26.460
Here we are again...

39:28.060 --> 39:31.899
sitting on a rank floor,

39:31.900 --> 39:34.859
danced out,
with blisters on our feet.

39:34.860 --> 39:37.700
I thought you were only supposed to
stay for one hour at this party?

39:37.700 --> 39:39.300
I never do what I'm told.

39:40.740 --> 39:44.300
Some things never change.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.460
I'm fucking terrified.

39:49.900 --> 39:53.100
It's fine, I'm terrified too.

39:56.580 --> 39:59.660
But I'm not going anywhere.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.660
I'm like shit on your stiletto.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.940
Ah, ya bastard!

40:06.940 --> 40:08.580
Fuck.

40:11.220 --> 40:12.980
Fucking hell.

40:12.980 --> 40:15.900
Yo, Creevey, Minnie needs you, mate.

40:25.180 --> 40:26.580
OK. Go.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.580
I'll come and see you soon, yeah?

40:32.581 --> 40:34.100
Cool.

40:35.860 --> 40:39.459
Oh, and this...

40:39.460 --> 40:40.579
It's OK.

40:40.580 --> 40:43.899
No, I stole it. I'm sorry.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.259
Will you come with me?

40:46.260 --> 40:48.019
Now.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.059
Why...?

40:49.060 --> 40:52.940
I said something to you
that wasn't true.

40:52.940 --> 40:54.860
About Mum.

40:56.180 --> 40:59.740
She was never cremated
when it happened.

40:59.740 --> 41:00.860
That's not what I did.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.579
I didn't want you to have her.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.699
That's OK, Clara.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.859
I could take you to where
I put her.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.340
Where she ended up.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.420
Do you want to come?

41:19.940 --> 41:21.420
Dad?

41:21.420 --> 41:22.460
Anything, Franky.

41:24.580 --> 41:26.020
You know that.

45:19.460 --> 45:20.740
Bye.
