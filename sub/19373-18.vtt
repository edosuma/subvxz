Hah-hah, well,
the dear does.

13:10.353 --> 13:12.049
So, how do I start?

13:12.117 --> 13:13.217
To earn your green...

13:13.285 --> 13:14.382
How do I start?

13:14.449 --> 13:17.374
To earn your green belt,
you must pass three tests.

13:17.491 --> 13:20.253
Speed, strength, and balance.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.815
First is speed.

13:21.909 --> 13:23.831
Catch all the apples in this
basket

13:23.898 --> 13:25.221
before they touch the ground.

13:25.315 --> 13:28.302
I think I can do that.
When do we start?

13:28.502 --> 13:30.964
Right...
now!

13:31.032 --> 13:32.700
Hi-yah!

13:33.682 --> 13:34.965
Hi-yah!

13:35.976 --> 13:37.942
Yah, yah!

13:38.649 --> 13:39.981
Hi-yah!

13:42.667 --> 13:43.809
Hi-yah!

13:48.022 --> 13:50.989
Well done! But I think you
lost something!

13:51.137 --> 13:52.762
Uh-oh, my pup tag!

13:52.865 --> 13:55.012
I saw it drop over there.

13:55.355 --> 13:56.516
There it is!

13:56.617 --> 13:58.207
I think I can reach it.

14:00.101 --> 14:01.502
Marshall, get back!

14:01.602 --> 14:03.395
Hi-yah!

14:06.343 --> 14:07.511
Sensei Yumi!

14:07.618 --> 14:09.301
I'm down here!

14:09.377 --> 14:11.770
Phew. Are you okay?

14:11.838 --> 14:15.239
I'm fine, but this wall is too
steep for me to climb up.

14:15.348 --> 14:18.754
And without my pup tag, I can't
call Ryder for help!

14:18.822 --> 14:20.770
What do we do now?

14:22.489 --> 14:24.957
Since Marshall's not using his
pup pack right now,

14:25.110 --> 14:27.239
this is a good time to
clean it for him.

14:27.314 --> 14:30.871
Yeah, it'll be a way cool
surprise when he gets back!

14:31.379 --> 14:32.575
Ryder, here.

14:32.643 --> 14:35.350
<i>Hey, Ryder, my whiz-bang
weather instruments show</i>

14:35.418 --> 14:37.772
<i>a wicked windstorm coming in
from the west.</i>

14:37.872 --> 14:40.775
Then it's headed out to where
Marshall and Sensei Yumi went!

14:40.875 --> 14:42.590
<i>It'd be wise to warn them.</i>

14:42.658 --> 14:45.489
Absolutely, thanks for the
update, Captain Turbot.

14:45.557 --> 14:47.025
Stay safe!

14:47.232 --> 14:49.739
I'd better call Marshall on his
pup tag to let him know

14:49.807 --> 14:51.059
about this storm.

14:51.174 --> 14:53.309
Ryder to Marshall.
Come in!

14:53.996 --> 14:55.128
What's wrong?

14:55.196 --> 14:58.145
He's not answering.
I'd better try Sensei Yumi.

15:02.029 --> 15:06.500
Oh, hi, Bettina! I guess Sensei
Yumi forgot to take her phone.

15:06.584 --> 15:09.054
Uh-oh, what if they get caught
in the storm?

15:09.193 --> 15:10.734
We're just going to have
to find them,

15:10.802 --> 15:12.843
and bring them back
before it hits.

15:14.108 --> 15:16.695
Uh, nice talking to you,
too, Bettina.

15:16.948 --> 15:19.773
PAW Patrol,
to the lookout!

15:19.946 --> 15:21.570

And Marshall and Sensei Yumi

16:01.686 --> 16:03.511
don't know that they're
right in its path!

16:03.579 --> 16:06.125
Oh, no, Ryder!
Is it dangerous?

16:06.208 --> 16:09.144
Not yet, but it might be if we
don't act fast.

16:09.221 --> 16:12.156
Trouble is, Marshall's not
answering his pup tag,

16:12.224 --> 16:15.234
and he and Sensei Yumi could be
anywhere on the mountain.

16:15.302 --> 16:18.109
So, for this mission,
I'll need Skye.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.562
I need you and your goggles to

Okay, Ryder!
Ruff! Goggles!

Whoa!

18:05.434 --> 18:06.936
Still with me, Ryder?

18:07.004 --> 18:08.598
Right behind you.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.351
I can't get a foothold
to climb up!

18:18.419 --> 18:21.549
Oh, I wish I had my pup tag
to call Ryder!

18:21.723 --> 18:25.536

that stick!

18:27.036 --> 18:28.930
Oh, be careful!

18:29.023 --> 18:30.618
You almost have it!

18:30.751 --> 18:31.970
Whoops!

18:32.243 --> 18:33.730
I'll grab it...
Whoa!

18:33.798 --> 18:34.941
Oh, my!

18:35.009 --> 18:37.432
Sensei! I'll get you!

18:37.532 --> 18:39.033
Hi-yah!

18:39.133 --> 18:41.269
Whoa!

18:41.369 --> 18:42.727
Hi-yah!

18:42.795 --> 18:46.758
Wow, that was so brave,
Marshall! And so strong.

18:46.828 --> 18:47.838
Thank you.

18:47.906 --> 18:51.367
You're welcome, but now we're
both stuck here.

18:51.453 --> 18:53.615
And we still can't call for
help.

18:53.683 --> 18:56.070
And the wind is really
picking up.

18:59.465 --> 19:01.227
Ryder, I see something!

19:02.477 --> 19:04.651
It's Marshall's pup tag!

19:04.719 --> 19:06.961
And Marshall and Sensei Yumi!

19:07.061 --> 19:09.289
They're getting blown around
on that ledge!

19:09.422 --> 19:11.742
<i>Good job, Skye!
We'll meet you there!</i>

19:11.938 --> 19:13.477
Can you get us there fast?!

19:13.586 --> 19:16.250
Yep, I know a shortcut!

19:19.531 --> 19:21.977
Sorry! But you said fast!

19:22.176 --> 19:25.945
Fast gets us to our friends sooner.
Let's keep going.

19:32.369 --> 19:35.437
Marshall? Sensei Yumi?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.219
You found us!

19:37.367 --> 19:41.281
My pup tag fell down there!
But we're stuck up here!

19:41.351 --> 19:42.500
Not for long.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.196
Skye, can you lift them out with
your harness?

19:45.264 --> 19:46.881
I'll try my best.

19:49.570 --> 19:50.872
Whoa!

19:50.972 --> 19:55.092
It's getting really windy!
Ruff! Harness!

19:58.757 --> 20:00.649
Marshall, students first!

20:00.717 --> 20:02.884
No, sensei's first.

20:03.115 --> 20:07.922
Sensei Yumi, you could put it on
and grab Marshall! Please hurry.

20:08.022 --> 20:10.291
I can't keep my copter steady in
this wind.

20:10.391 --> 20:12.024
Hop up, Marshall!

20:12.172 --> 20:13.228
Whoa!

20:13.414 --> 20:14.582
Whoa!

20:14.659 --> 20:16.661
That was a strong gust!

20:16.964 --> 20:19.300
We'll circle around and grab
you!

20:19.400 --> 20:22.748
No, Skye, you've got to land,
the wind's too strong.

20:22.826 --> 20:23.967
It's not safe.

20:24.035 --> 20:26.170
But how will we get
down to Marshall?

20:26.274 --> 20:30.569
Hmm. We can't. But we can get
Marshall down to us.

20:30.637 --> 20:33.233
Everest, can you reach the
bottom of this canyon?

20:33.358 --> 20:34.506
Sure can!

20:34.605 --> 20:37.428
I know this mountain like the
back of my paw.

20:40.321 --> 20:41.989
I'm in position, Ryder.

20:42.090 --> 20:43.391
<i>Okay, Everest.</i>

20:43.558 --> 20:45.563
Shoot your grapple to the ledge
beside Marshall.

20:45.631 --> 20:46.961
Arf! Grapple!

20:51.733 --> 20:53.853
Marshall! Loop your headband
around the grapple cable!

20:53.935 --> 20:57.383
My headband? Oh, great idea!

20:59.841 --> 21:01.109
Hi-yah!

21:04.120 --> 21:05.146
Shoo! Go away!

21:05.246 --> 21:07.385
No, coming!

21:10.251 --> 21:11.786
I can't see!

21:11.886 --> 21:13.488
Oh, no!

21:13.588 --> 21:15.890
Whoa! Whoa!

21:15.990 --> 21:19.543
Marshall! Remember your
pup-fu skills!

21:21.142 --> 21:22.548
Pup-fu!

21:28.483 --> 21:30.225
You are good!

21:30.293 --> 21:32.803
Way to go, Marshall!

21:33.662 --> 21:35.476
Listen to that wind!

21:35.741 --> 21:37.532
I'm so glad we're inside.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.514
Yes, safe and sound.

21:39.614 --> 21:41.819
Thanks again for helping me,
PAW Patrol.

21:41.944 --> 21:43.785
Especially you, Marshall.

21:43.893 --> 21:47.196
Just remember, if you're ever in
trouble, just...

21:47.288 --> 21:48.956
Hi-yah... for help!

21:49.057 --> 21:52.795
I hope the wind stops soon so
I can finally do my test!

21:52.885 --> 21:55.280
I can't wait to get
my green belt!

21:55.397 --> 21:58.209
Actually, I have
something for you.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.136
A green belt? For me?

22:02.373 --> 22:04.105
But... but...

22:04.205 --> 22:07.178
You passed the test of speed
with the apples.

22:07.263 --> 22:10.405
You pulled me back from the
ledge, demonstrating strength.

22:10.473 --> 22:13.006
Then, your awesome slide on top
of the cable,

22:13.084 --> 22:15.416
showed amazing balance.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.218
You've earned it.

22:18.492 --> 22:20.376
Congratulations, Marshall!

22:20.444 --> 22:22.483
Way to go, Marshall!

22:22.657 --> 22:25.193
So, can you show me how to
balance on a ball?

22:25.293 --> 22:29.964
Sure! Just step on top,
focus, and...

22:30.064 --> 22:31.766
Whoaa!

22:31.866 --> 22:33.768
Oh, no!
Chase, stop!

22:33.868 --> 22:36.116
Whoa!

22:36.283 --> 22:38.285
Now I know
how Marshall feels!

22:38.425 --> 22:40.663
It's kind of fun,
isn't it?
