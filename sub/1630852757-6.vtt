04:19.968 --> 04:23.012
Just like you conned
my fellow Mithraic.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.516
Justice is coming for you, Marcus.

04:26.516 --> 04:31.270
And yours will be a punishment

04:34.107 --> 04:36.776
I thought you were more
civilized than that, Lucius.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.736
I am.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.197
Simply killing you
would satisfy me.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.824
But as I said,

04:42.824 --> 04:45.284
we must follow Sol's laws.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.413
And Sol's law says
a false prophet must suffer.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.626

14:19.400 --> 14:21.860
If you want me to be a leader,

14:21.944 --> 14:24.822
then you have to let me start
making decisions of my own.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.537
Tell me how releasing Marcus
will benefit the collective.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.163
