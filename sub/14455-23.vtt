WEBVTT

00:12.333 --> 00:15.567
Narrator: Coming up,
why is Joe going belly

00:17.567 --> 00:20.167
What's got Sal
and Murr passing gas?

00:20.167 --> 00:21.233
Oh, you got --
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.300
And which losing Joker
will be a Major League Jerk

00:26.300 --> 00:28.067
in tonight's punishment?

00:28.067 --> 00:30.033
Oh!

00:30.033 --> 00:32.700
Sal: Prepare for
something amazing.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.733
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.433 --> 00:37.567
Murr: I want my mommy!

00:38.900 --> 00:41.833
Sal: I will never forgive you!

00:41.833 --> 00:43.200
Joe: Larry!

00:49.567 --> 00:51.400
Today, we're at
Universal Orlando Resort's

00:51.400 --> 00:53.967
brand-new water
theme park Volcano Bay.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.400
As we mingle with
fellow park-goers,

00:55.400 --> 00:57.267
the other guys are gonna
tell us what we have to do.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.067
If you can't complete
the ridiculous task, you lose.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.633
Joe: All right,
here we go.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.500
Sal: Murr, you actually
look super cool.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.233
-You do look cool.

01:09.233 --> 01:12.067
You look like the bad guy
from every '80's movie --

01:12.067 --> 01:13.933
which, for me, is
the ultimate coolness.

01:13.933 --> 01:17.467
You literally look like
you're in "Cobra Kai."

01:17.467 --> 01:18.967
-Let's get to it.

01:18.967 --> 01:22.833
All you got to do, Murr,
is, uh, honk a man's pectorals.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.100
Three times.

01:26.467 --> 01:28.267
I like your headband, man.
I got one, too.

01:28.267 --> 01:30.200
Do you work out?
-A little bit.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
A little bit.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.433
What do --
what do you do?

01:33.433 --> 01:36.367
-Look at them pecs, Murr.
-'Cause I see you...

01:36.367 --> 01:37.667
Joe: Honk 'em!

01:37.667 --> 01:39.200
You have, like, glistening pecs,
you know what I mean?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.067
It's like, really,
you know -- honk-honk --

01:41.067 --> 01:43.067
and it's, like, good, you know?
I'm trying to get that, too.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.067
One down, two to go.

01:47.067 --> 01:51.467
-Oh, my God. This is nice,
right
-Yeah.

01:51.467 --> 01:54.067
I'm here with my --
you know -- my -- my -- no one.

01:54.067 --> 01:57.167
"Here With My No One --
The James Murray Story."

01:58.533 --> 02:03.267
Do you, uh... Do you work out?
Do you work out? You do...

02:03.267 --> 02:04.933
-Yeah.
I see it.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.967
The ladies like the --
you know -- they like the --

02:06.967 --> 02:08.833
they like the big pecs,
you know?

02:08.833 --> 02:11.200
They love these.
I'm trying to get it.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.067
I'm trying. Honk-honk.
And they won't do it.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.867
I'm trying to build
them up myself.

02:14.867 --> 02:17.633
Anyways, enjoy the park.
-Two down, one to go.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.533
So, Murr, we want a behind-the-
back, speechless "honk."

02:20.533 --> 02:22.333
All right. All right.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.333
Here he goes.
Here he goes.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.667
Here he goes.
-Here we go.

02:26.133 --> 02:30.700
Sal: Oh, man. Oh, man.
Oh, man. Oh, man!

02:30.700 --> 02:32.167
Q: Here he goes.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.467
Honk-honk.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.100
Bros -- bros.
Bros. We're bros.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.400
What a way
to finish, buddy.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.867
Good work.
-I'm done. I'm done.

02:44.633 --> 02:45.867
Sal: So, here's
the thing, all right?

02:45.867 --> 02:47.733
-Yeah.
-I want you to get people

02:47.733 --> 02:49.900
to agree that the sand
tastes delicious.

02:50.967 --> 02:53.567
You know because
you're gonna eat it.

02:53.567 --> 02:56.433
-I'm eating the sand.
-Yeah.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.300
So, they should
taste it as well, right?

02:58.300 --> 03:00.733
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Ohh...

03:00.733 --> 03:03.067
There's a lot of
bad feet on this sand.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.567
-That's right.
-Mm-hmm.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.167
Oh, there's hair
in the sand.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.733
Joe: There's hair in the sand.
I bet it's delicious.

03:08.733 --> 03:10.333
There's no way
someone's gonna eat sand.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.067
No way.
Well, somebody is --

03:12.067 --> 03:13.467
Q.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.700
Is that the --
is that the sand?

03:15.700 --> 03:18.367
Is that the sand?
-No.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.333
Oh, the guy over
there was telling me

03:20.333 --> 03:21.533
that it tastes
like cotton candy.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.367
I didn't know
if you were eating it.

03:23.367 --> 03:24.867
Let me give a shot at this.
-They believe it.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.067
They're in.
They're in.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.900
Oh, well, they said
they flavor the sand.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.100
He ain't having it.
-Oh! Ohh!

03:30.100 --> 03:32.400
Oh, my God.
He did it.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.733
Well, no. Now, this guy's
got to taste it.

03:33.733 --> 03:36.067
Hand him some. Try it.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.267
Come on. Wait.
No, no, no, no.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.100
Melts in your mouth...
like cotton candy.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.100
You got to try it.
-No, no, no.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.367
-Oh! He's out of here.
-Agh.

03:42.367 --> 03:43.667
I mean, he ate sand.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.267
Yeah, which is nice.
But no one else tasted it yet.

03:48.367 --> 03:50.500
Oh, man, you were right,
this works!

03:50.500 --> 03:52.267
I can't believe it!

03:52.267 --> 03:57.233
Wow! The sand here is actually
flavored like cotton candy.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.267
You want to try some?
It's delicious.

03:59.267 --> 04:03.067
Come on. Give it a shot.
Here you go. Ah. Ahh!

04:06.900 --> 04:09.200
-I don't...
-Wow.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.967
Oh, I love this guy.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.967
All right, I got to go wash
my mouth out with bleach.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.600
-Get him a water.
-Get him a water.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.833
Agh.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.767
There you go.
I can't believe he got it.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.367
Also, buddy,
that's pool water.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.900
Sal: Ah, you son
of a bitch!

04:25.900 --> 04:28.233
You remember when you
made me drink pool water?

04:28.233 --> 04:30.500
Yeah!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.433
Murr: All right. That's a new
bathing suit, right, Joe?

04:32.433 --> 04:34.567
-New one. Brand-new.
-For your challenge,

04:34.567 --> 04:36.300
you have the most
irritating bathing suit

04:36.300 --> 04:38.067
in all of Volcano Bay.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.767
Make sure everybody knows it.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.267
Uh-huh.
We're going big?

04:42.267 --> 04:43.467
Go big.

04:43.467 --> 04:45.833
All right.
Ah, the chafe.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.867
The way to fight the chafe
is just swing them out.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.767
I tell you, that's something
spectacular to see.

04:52.767 --> 04:55.600
I only got one issue --
mad chafe.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.633
Joe, walk around her
in a circle. Like, "shark" her.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.500
While you're talking
to her.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.400
The walk is really
the most important part.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.567
It's really just
keeping knees up.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.133
Every time I do
a step without,

05:04.133 --> 05:05.300
this is like a layer
coming right off.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.300
But if I do
the high step...

05:07.300 --> 05:08.700
I could start a fire --
that's right.

05:12.267 --> 05:14.067
Q: There he goes.
There he goes.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.767
I got a mean chafe
going on.

05:16.767 --> 05:18.633
Yeah.
-The belly's come out to play.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.467
Joe, put the belly
up and down.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.167
Oh, my God.
You look like a --

05:25.167 --> 05:27.200
You look like
a blow fish.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
Like, trying to mate
with this guy.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.067
-You do it.
-Yeah.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.933
He's doing it.
Now, this guy's doing it.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.067
One, two, three -- boom.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.233
Oil her up.

05:38.233 --> 05:39.933
Yeah, but that's not
the point of this.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.100
This isn't even what
I'm supposed to be doing.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.467
I'm supposed to tell you
about the chafing.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.667
I got sidetracked.

05:45.233 --> 05:49.900
Oh, good. The waves.
Oh, thank god.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.467
Joe, there's no way that a lot
of people are hearing this.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.067
Murr: We need all
of Volcano Bay

05:54.067 --> 05:56.333
to know how uncomfortable
your bathing suit is.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.167
I got to tell
the whole place?

05:59.167 --> 06:01.133
I got to
chill the chafe!

06:01.133 --> 06:03.667
I gots to
chill the chafe!

06:03.667 --> 06:07.600
I gots to
chill the chafe!

06:07.600 --> 06:09.833
Oh, my God!

06:09.833 --> 06:12.600
Joe Gatto -- "I've gots
to chill the chafe."

06:12.600 --> 06:15.233
The chafe
is chilled, child.

06:15.233 --> 06:16.233
Boom.

06:19.467 --> 06:20.800
All right, fellers.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.967
I like that you went with the
all-black in the blazing sun.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.100
-It is moisture-wicking.
-Okay, well, listen.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.067
Speaking of moisture,
use someone's towel

06:27.067 --> 06:30.200
to blow your nose
three times.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.467
All right, Sal, there's a little
kid sitting in his towel

06:32.467 --> 06:34.333
right there, hanging out
with his dad.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.833
Oh, my God.

06:35.833 --> 06:36.833
We are ready.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.733
All right.

06:38.733 --> 06:39.967
Ah-choo!

06:41.633 --> 06:45.400
Q: Oh, man, dude.
This is rough.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.667
The father slept
right through it.

06:52.667 --> 06:53.767
All right,
that wasn't that hard.

06:53.767 --> 06:55.067
It was a lot easier
than we thought.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.600
So, do it again.
-Okay, here we go.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.933
I'm gonna psych
myself up.

06:57.933 --> 07:01.633
Yeah.

07:01.633 --> 07:04.167
That's Sal
getting psyched up.

07:04.167 --> 07:05.933
I'm gonna go hard
in the paint.

07:05.933 --> 07:10.067
Hard in the paint.
-Here we go. Here we go.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.067
Ah-choo!

07:15.767 --> 07:17.567
I cannot believe
what I just saw.

07:17.567 --> 07:21.267
-Oh, my God.
-I can't believe that.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.567
Can I come back?

07:22.567 --> 07:26.433
-No!
-There's still one left.

07:26.433 --> 07:28.533
Murr: Sal. Why don't
you try blowing your nose

07:28.533 --> 07:30.600
on somebody where it's
around their waist already.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.667
-Yeah, yeah.
That's the way to do it.
-Around the waist.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.233
I'm nervous.
I'm very nervous.

07:35.233 --> 07:38.067
-As you should.
-Go get it. Get it. Get it.

07:40.533 --> 07:41.533
Hey, get the --

07:47.167 --> 07:48.367
Yeah!

07:48.367 --> 07:50.167
I just got slapped.
That's what you wanted.

07:50.167 --> 07:53.067
Are you happy?

07:53.067 --> 07:54.867
All the guys were
cool at the pool,

07:54.867 --> 07:57.400
so they're safe
from the loser board.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.067
Today, we're at Food Bazaar
competing head-to-head in a game

08:00.067 --> 08:02.167
we call
"Stockboy Shootout."

08:02.167 --> 08:04.067
When a shopper enters
our playing area,

08:04.067 --> 08:06.867
we're gonna take turns shooting
toilet rolls into their cart.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.433
Whoever sinks the least
amount of rolls

08:08.433 --> 08:13.267
by the time the shopper leaves
our playing area loses.

08:15.933 --> 08:17.067
Someone's got
to clean that up.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.700
That's not gonna
get you any points.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.300
Murr: The gladiators
have entered the arena.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.133
All right, so this
is how it goes, Q.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.767
As soon as someone enters
on either line, they're in play.

08:28.767 --> 08:30.233
-Yes.
-If they enter from this end,

08:30.233 --> 08:33.533
I'm having a way easier go at it
than you until it gets to you.

08:33.533 --> 08:36.067
-That's right.
-But it's one-at-a-time.
Tit for tat.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.367
Joe: Here we go.

08:37.367 --> 08:38.500
That's tough.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.700
Oh.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.967
He's got a blocker
for Sal.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.767
That is on me.

08:44.767 --> 08:47.100
-Sal, there's no way.
-I'm gonna try and clear that.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.633
Here you go, bub.

08:49.633 --> 08:52.200
-Oh!
-Hold up, sir. Hold on, sir.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.667
Here we go. Here we go.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.733
-Oh, two-nothing.
-That counts.

08:56.733 --> 09:00.233
2-1.
It's 2 to 1. 3-1.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.400
I got to be Larry Bird
up in this bitch.

09:07.067 --> 09:10.167
-Oh, Sal's hitting them.
-Sal is draining them.

09:10.167 --> 09:14.433
You -- guy --
you're killing me, guys.

09:14.433 --> 09:17.600
-Oh!
-Oh!

09:17.600 --> 09:19.733
Watch out, lady!

09:19.733 --> 09:22.533
-The guy just ducked.
-Hold on.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.733
No, push through!
Push through.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.667
I sank another one!

09:27.667 --> 09:28.900
-Q wins!
-He got it!

09:28.900 --> 09:30.067
-Q gets it.
-Q wins.

09:30.067 --> 09:33.067
-Whoo!
-What an ending.

09:33.067 --> 09:35.067
-All right, Joey.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.067
We ready down here.

09:37.433 --> 09:40.467
You look like your cover-band
gig just got canceled.

09:42.567 --> 09:43.867
This is your hair, Q.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.667
-I know.
-I look like you.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.900
You look like
you're starring

09:46.900 --> 09:49.267
in a high-school production
of "Rock of Ages."

09:51.533 --> 09:52.833
Coming up behind you.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.233
I have to get something
besides the toilet paper.

09:56.933 --> 09:58.533
I got the toilet paper
for this evening

09:58.533 --> 10:01.167
to get me through to 7:00 a.m.
I live alone.

10:03.633 --> 10:05.500
'Cause it's
Mexican night.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.633
He has theme nights
for himself.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.367
What else did I need?
I got toilet paper.

10:11.367 --> 10:12.733
What else did I need?

10:16.467 --> 10:18.300
-Uh-oh.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.867
Q:
Joe's got the advantage.

10:19.867 --> 10:23.367
Murr: Here you go.
There you go. There's two.

10:23.367 --> 10:25.233
-Ahh.
-Ahh.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.167
Sal: Murray's up 2-1.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.867
-That's the end of Joe. Ohh!
-2-2, 3-2.

10:29.867 --> 10:34.333
-3-3! 4-3.
-Nice and easy.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.900
-Oh, come on.
-7-5.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.233
Joe:
I'm draining 'em.

10:46.433 --> 10:48.667
Well, move your  then.
Move it!

10:49.933 --> 10:52.133
Oh, this is super-easy now
for me.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.033
Aah!

10:54.033 --> 10:55.500
Trying to knock
the wig off him.

10:57.733 --> 11:00.100
-Oh, that was just --
-That was a --

11:00.100 --> 11:02.933
-That was a drubbing.
-You got beat by the hair.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.100
Ooh.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.933
You got to pay
for all that now.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.600
You got to pay
for all those.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.500
Don't try to get out of here
for free with them.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.200
Well, you should have
moved it closer.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.067
If I won, you could
have kept them!

11:14.067 --> 11:17.800
I don't even work here. I'm just
shooting in strangers' carts.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.300
You pay for those
toilet papers!

11:22.333 --> 11:25.367
Narrator: Joe and Sal were
outshot in this shootout,

11:25.367 --> 11:28.200
so they're first up
on the loser board.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.300
Hey, fellas.
Isn't it beautiful out?

11:30.300 --> 11:32.600
Let's play a game
called "Hot Potato."

11:32.600 --> 11:35.333
Two of us are gonna sit on
opposite sides of a stranger,

11:35.333 --> 11:36.600
and we're gonna
take turns passing

11:36.600 --> 11:38.300
an unusual item
to each other.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.100
And we'll have to keep
coming up with the reasons

11:40.100 --> 11:41.767
to pass the items
back and forth.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.333
If you are holding the weird
item when the stranger gets up,

11:44.333 --> 11:45.833
you lose.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.333
Hot potato.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.067
**

11:51.067 --> 11:53.800
All right, guys. So, Sal and I
planted something in your bag

11:53.800 --> 11:54.733
to pass back and forth.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.133
Ohre here, actually.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.333
-Here we go.
-You're gonna see Rhonda first.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.400
Do you mind giving
Rhonda back her shoe?

12:01.400 --> 12:02.800
Oh.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.300
A single high-heel,
which has so many implications.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.900
Yeah, there's so
many stories there.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.267
I wasn't with Rhonda.
I was with Sandy.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.933
Sal:
So far, he's ignoring.

12:10.933 --> 12:12.700
But, you know,
now that I think about it,

12:12.700 --> 12:15.633
Sandy and Rhonda
live in the same building.

12:15.633 --> 12:16.867
So, when you see Sandy,

12:16.867 --> 12:18.767
maybe you could have her
do the handoff to Rhonda.

12:18.767 --> 12:20.233
Ah, I see.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.433
Sal:
The conversation over him

12:21.433 --> 12:23.633
is even more annoying
to him than the shoe.

12:23.633 --> 12:27.400
But I'm not sure when
I'm gonna see Sandy again,

12:27.400 --> 12:30.167
and I know that you're in
that joint every other night,

12:30.167 --> 12:32.267
so why don't you just roll in
and bring it with you there?

12:32.267 --> 12:34.200
-That's true.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.667
Maybe I'll just give it --
I'll give it back to her.

12:36.667 --> 12:37.833
Murr:
Oh, Joe's got it back!

12:37.833 --> 12:39.167
Sal: So far,
this guy has not flinched.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.800
I am there all the time, but I'm
going out of town next week

12:41.800 --> 12:44.600
and you're gonna be there
for the Fourth of July party.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.067
Oh! Okay, right.
Yeah.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.067
You're gonna be there
for the party.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.533
-You got the first glare.
-He just looked.

12:49.533 --> 12:50.733
The first glare
just came.

12:50.733 --> 12:52.467
Remember I was
going to the doctor

12:52.467 --> 12:53.467
about that shoe

12:53.467 --> 12:54.933
-Yes.
-I still got it.

12:54.933 --> 12:57.067
So they're not gonna get
to her in this condition.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.533
So, yeah...

13:00.167 --> 13:01.767
Yeah, you know what, though?
That's --

13:01.767 --> 13:03.967
-Oh!
-Ohh!

13:03.967 --> 13:06.167
That sounds like
it's my problem, you know,

13:06.167 --> 13:07.833
and I'm just gonna
keep this, then.

13:07.833 --> 13:08.900
This is mine.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.333
Murr: Good job, Q.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.767
Q: Here we go.

13:13.767 --> 13:16.467
**

13:16.467 --> 13:17.633
Dude, Murr.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.200
I'm sitting here
waiting for you.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.367
I didn't even realize
you're sitting right there.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.300
I brought -- I brought it.
I have it, so...

13:23.300 --> 13:24.633
The barbecue was great.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.067
Thank you for
letting me borrow it.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.333
Oh. Thank you.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.367
I thought you were
gonna return it full.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.567
-That's full.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.133
This feels too light
to be full.

13:34.133 --> 13:36.633
-I just filled it.
-This feels way too light.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.133
Feel how light it is.
Feel how light it is.

13:38.133 --> 13:40.067
I know. I carried it
all the way here.
No. Feel how light.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.133
I carried it
all the way here.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.433
Feel how light it is.
It's so light.

13:42.433 --> 13:45.367
No, it's full. It was only --
I have the receipt.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.067
-It's 28 bucks.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.967
-Yeah, take it.

13:48.967 --> 13:51.667
And I know you need it
'cause you said you have
that barbecue today.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.667
No, it got canceled.
It got canceled.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.067
The weather's too nice.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.800
You know what?
Let me see that bag.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.100
Let me see the bag
that you have.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.067
Thanks. Yeah, it's hard
to carry, right?

14:03.067 --> 14:05.267
-Put it in the bag.

14:05.267 --> 14:06.933
Oh, okay.
You hold this.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.067
No, I'm saying
put it in the bag.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.567
Oh, you mean --
Oh, carry it in the bag.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.067
Like...

14:13.067 --> 14:15.233
One second. Sorry.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.100
Here, open it up,
and I'll slide it in there.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.500
Joe: There you go, Sal!

14:19.500 --> 14:22.633
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Oh, thank you so much.

14:22.633 --> 14:23.967
Wait. Who needs to keep it?

14:23.967 --> 14:25.900
He's keeping it.
He's keeping it.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.167
That's fine.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.533
-It's a draw.
-It's a draw.

14:31.533 --> 14:32.933
It's a draw. Good work.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.633
You're gonna need the bag.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.833
Narrator:
Joe got stuck on the bench,

14:38.833 --> 14:43.633
but he'll see some playing time
in tonight's punishment.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.467
Well, well.
Joe's our big loser.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.100
So we brought him to Citi Field,
home of the New York Mets.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.067
That's right. And we got
our friend to help us out --

14:50.067 --> 14:51.867
Mets ace Noah Syndergaard.

14:51.867 --> 14:53.633
Noah, do you think you could
sign a couple balls for us?

14:53.633 --> 14:55.067
-Yeah, no problem.
-All right.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.967
Okay, and then you're gonna
take those autographed balls,

14:56.967 --> 14:58.967
you're gonna throw them
into the stands for fans,

14:58.967 --> 15:01.333
except, Joe, you are
gonna intercept them

15:01.333 --> 15:03.133
and steal
everyone's autographs.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.667
It's gonna be great.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.867
New York sports fans are known
for their calm demeanor.

15:06.867 --> 15:08.733
-You're gonna be fine.
-You're gonna die.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.100
Joe: Yeah, I know.

15:12.633 --> 15:14.867
Sal: Okay, so here we go.
It's right before game time.

15:14.867 --> 15:16.467
Noah's out there
signing autographs

15:16.467 --> 15:18.067
for fans like he does.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.233
Little kids dream of this.

15:19.233 --> 15:20.600
I mean, this is
the star pitcher, right?

15:20.600 --> 15:23.167
That's right.
Noah is the main man.

15:23.167 --> 15:26.200
He's gonna give signed balls
to all these fans eventually.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.067
Just...not right now.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.767
-There he is.
-There he is.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.333
Super fan Joe Gatto.
There he is.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.700
Avid collector.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.333
Joe: Noah's down there.
Oh, there he is.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.167
Joe is playing the role
of fanatic today.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.433
-Look at the satchel.
-Joe, I got to be honest.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.433
You're not
the headband type.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.467
All right, Joe,
your goal is to steal

15:44.467 --> 15:47.700
as many balls as Noah
throws to the fans.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.367
-Joe, this kid right there.
-Look at that little kid.

15:49.367 --> 15:50.600
-With the hat on.
-He has his glove.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.067
-He's waiting for Noah.
-There we go.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.500
-Here we go. Here we go!
-Here we go.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.933
Sal: The kid is dumbfounded.
He's like,

16:07.933 --> 16:10.767
"That was literally gonna be
the best day of my life."

16:10.767 --> 16:13.467
Murr: Joe, he still
wants a ball. He still
got his glove up.

16:13.467 --> 16:15.333
you guys.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.833
It's not for the guy
with the headband.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.667
It's for the kids.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.833
-Oh!
-Ohh!

16:23.833 --> 16:25.800
Gotta be quicker.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.633
Murr: You're the biggest
jerk in the world.

16:29.633 --> 16:32.300
Next time you call him,
go "Jeter!"

16:32.300 --> 16:34.600
Not the right team,
not the right league,

16:34.600 --> 16:36.467
not the right position.

16:36.467 --> 16:37.867
Joe: Jeter!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.433
Sal: He's cracking up.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.200
Joe: Jeter, I like
the new haircut.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.700
Jeter, I got to get
a ball for my kid.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.833
I'm not Jeter, buddy.
Come on.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.167
What's his nickname?
-Thor.

16:48.167 --> 16:49.567
Hulk!

16:51.500 --> 16:53.267
He's great.
How about a ball, though?

16:53.267 --> 16:55.333
More signing,
a little less...

16:55.333 --> 16:57.900
This is for the fat guy
that looks like a toucan.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.133
All right, Joe.
Move along.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.833
Oh, you ran down?
Yeah, me too.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.267
Young man:
Can I have a ball? Thor.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.633
I have your jersey on.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.067
Murr: Here you go, Joe.

17:17.067 --> 17:20.967
-Yeah.
-Wow!

17:20.967 --> 17:22.467
Q: Stay there, Joe.
Do another one.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.433
Oh, you want him to --
You want him to sign that?

17:24.433 --> 17:26.567
-Yeah.
-Just see if he can sign that.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.633
Well, let him sign this
for you, right?

17:28.633 --> 17:32.300
Thor, will you sign this for
him? He didn't get the ball.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.667
Yeah.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.100
Just sign this
for this guy.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.067
-I'll put it in the hat.
-Put it in the hat. Thanks.

17:39.067 --> 17:42.100
**

17:42.100 --> 17:43.700
Joe, ask that kid,
"He was injured?"

17:45.333 --> 17:46.967
He was hurt?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:46.967 --> 17:49.300
Q: All right, Joe.
That's your hat now.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.567
He signed my hat, too.
Thank you, man. Appreciate it.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.800
-Thanks, man. Thanks.
-Get out of there, Joe.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.833
-Get out -- Get out of there!
-That is awesome.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.900
That is awe--
That is awesome.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.600
Give me my hat back, man!

17:59.600 --> 18:01.567
-It's mine.
-It's my hat, dude.

18:03.567 --> 18:06.533
Oh, my God.
This is brutal.

18:06.533 --> 18:09.667
Q: Joe, stay deep. Let him arc
one over the crowd to you.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.267
Go ahead, Noah.

18:11.267 --> 18:14.767
-Yeah!
-Oh!

18:14.767 --> 18:17.800
"My seventh ball.
eBay, here I come!"

18:17.800 --> 18:19.667
That's number 7 for eBay.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.700
Yeah, you want one?
You go on eBay.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.933
My username is "Joe Gatto."

18:31.967 --> 18:33.667
I'm out here working.
Look out, little girl.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.367
Murr:
Joe, fight to get those balls.

18:35.367 --> 18:40.200
Joe: Oh, yep. Yeah! Yeah!
Number 8 now.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.267
Now we're making that money.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.067
-Oh, my God.
-It's brutal.

18:43.067 --> 18:45.400
-Oh, my God.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.300
He's famous, right?

18:49.067 --> 18:52.900
Joe, borrow this kid under
the guise of getting her a ball.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.867
I'm sorry. Did you want
to get her a ball?

18:55.867 --> 18:59.467
Yeah, yeah, come here.
I know him.

18:59.467 --> 19:01.933
Yeah. Just pretend
you're my daughter.

19:01.933 --> 19:05.567
Thor, one for
my little girl!

19:05.567 --> 19:07.600
Great.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.300
Great.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.167
Uh, it was for the
little girl. Thanks.

19:11.167 --> 19:12.500
Murr: Oh, Joe got it.
Joe got it.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.167
-There you go.
-Joe, run. Get out of there.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.933
See, look, it's signed
to him and everything.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.133
Thank you.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.633
Q: Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.500
That's nine.
I got another one.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.600
I gave -- No,
I gave it to the guy.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.267
Murr:
Oh, the mother's chasing Joe.

19:25.267 --> 19:27.567
-Guys, you can get it on eBay.
-The mother's chasing you.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.667
-Oh, no.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.700
You cannot do that!

19:32.700 --> 19:35.167
Give me the ball!
That's wrong!

19:35.167 --> 19:36.800
This one?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.567
Stop! That is wrong!

19:38.567 --> 19:41.700
What do we do here,
fellas?

19:41.700 --> 19:43.133
Talk about eBay.
Talk about eBay.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.633
-You can get it on eBay.
-How dare you!

19:45.633 --> 19:47.967
"Look, I'm as big
a Jeter fan as anyone."

19:47.967 --> 19:51.733
I'm as big
a Jeter fan as any.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.467
Woman: You apologize!

19:53.467 --> 19:55.833
I am 1,000% sorry.

19:55.833 --> 19:59.200
"So sorry I didn't get
that ball" and walk away.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.033
Sal: "So sorry
I didn't get the ball."

20:01.033 --> 20:02.567
"I'm so sorry
I didn't get that ball."

20:02.567 --> 20:04.233
I'm so sorry
I didn't get that ball.

20:06.533 --> 20:09.667
Oh, my God!

20:09.667 --> 20:12.900
Get out of there before
she kills you, Joe.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.967
All right, guys, so,
I think I got enough balls.

20:14.967 --> 20:18.200
I think I'm gonna go.
Gonna take off. Thank you.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.067
Joe, you're...outta there!

20:21.067 --> 20:24.633
I mean, I feel like a terrible
person if I'm gonna be honest.

20:24.633 --> 20:28.300
**

20:28.300 --> 20:30.233
All right.
Welcome to a very special

20:30.233 --> 20:32.467
"Impractical Insider"
from Citi Field.

20:32.467 --> 20:34.167
Joe Gatto just struck out,
and now you get

20:34.167 --> 20:35.867
a behind-the-scenes look
of how it happened

20:35.867 --> 20:37.367
and bonus footage
from tonight's episode.

20:37.367 --> 20:40.833
Right, Mr. Met?
That's right.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.133
What is that?

20:42.133 --> 20:43.533
This is a
Thor-signed baseball.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.700
-Yeah.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.467
I mean, like, were you
nervous to ask him

20:46.467 --> 20:48.700
even though you were just,
like, hanging out with him?

20:48.700 --> 20:51.133
Uh, no,
I didn't ask him.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.567
Somebody else had it, and I
just, wonk, stole it from them.

20:53.567 --> 20:56.500
I mean, you're doing what Joe
has to do for a punishment.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.767
Yeah, but with no fear of any
repercussions whatsoever.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.367
Right, right.

21:00.367 --> 21:02.267
McPartland: When we heard that
Noah was a fan of the show,

21:02.267 --> 21:04.067
you know, he said he just
wanted to be a part of it.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.667
He wanted to be in
the punishment somehow.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.233
So it took us a little
while to figure out,

21:07.233 --> 21:10.333
you know, how do we integrate
him into the punishment?

21:10.333 --> 21:12.633
-You're gonna die.
-Yeah, I know.

21:12.633 --> 21:14.067
Jost:
He took a big risk.

21:14.067 --> 21:15.833
The fact that he let us,
you know,

21:15.833 --> 21:17.767
work with his fans like that
and steal balls from them.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.233
-He's a cool guy.
-Yeah.

21:19.233 --> 21:20.800
Jost:
All right, so, the intro's

21:20.800 --> 21:22.967
going to be at home plate
of Citi Field.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.100
It's just -- when I'm saying
this out loud, it's insane.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.867
Kustanowitz:
There were a lot of ideas that
we were thinking about doing

21:27.867 --> 21:29.633
that involved the players.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.667
But we couldn't do them because
the players know the show.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.367
And on the one hand,
that was a bummer

21:34.367 --> 21:36.900
because it would have been fun
to involve them in the prank,

21:36.900 --> 21:38.667
but on the other hand,
it's pretty cool

21:38.667 --> 21:40.600
to know that the Mets
players love the show.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.300
Man: 3, 2, 1.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.200
Q: Well, well.
Joe's our big loser.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.367
So we brought him to Citi Field,
home of the New York Mets.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.500
So, I stand out there,
and he throws balls.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.667
-Like, I'm dressed like this.
-Sorry, sorry.

21:50.667 --> 21:51.900
Did you dress yourself?

21:51.900 --> 21:53.233
This is an odd look
you got going on.

21:53.233 --> 21:54.633
No, this is --
This is what the kids do.

21:54.633 --> 21:57.333
They're like, "Hey, let's get --
Take me out to the ballgame."

21:57.333 --> 21:59.267
Yeah, Joe,
you look silly.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.500
Are you nervous?

22:02.500 --> 22:04.333
-No.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.667
-Never.
-Wow.

22:05.667 --> 22:08.233
Never show weakness, Casey.
Never show weakness to anybody.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.467
You never show weakness.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.667
You never...

22:12.667 --> 22:14.933
Never.

22:14.933 --> 22:16.233
-You have a --
-Never!

22:16.233 --> 22:17.900
Did you have
eggplant parm?

22:17.900 --> 22:19.733
I did.
And I never show weakness.

22:19.733 --> 22:20.867
I can tell.

22:20.867 --> 22:22.633
-That's my earpiece.
-Whew.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.433
-Oh, there he is.
-Super fan Joe Gatto.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.900
-There he is.
-Avid collector.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.767
You're the kind of guy that
waits at an airport for no one.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.733
-Noah! Noah!
-Here we go.

22:30.733 --> 22:33.100
-Oh!
-One down.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.800
-Joe got one.
-Thanks, man.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.067
Q: All right, Joe.
Move along.

22:38.067 --> 22:40.133
Yeah, you go on eBay.
You can get 'em on eBay.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.200
Thor, I'm gonna need
one more!

22:45.200 --> 22:47.067
eBay!

22:50.833 --> 22:53.200
Some guy comes along and starts
taking balls from people.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.533
What do you think?

22:54.533 --> 22:57.067
Uh, I mean, I don't think
it's right at all.

22:59.433 --> 23:01.200
-Yeah!
-eBay.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.100
That one looked like
a frenzy right there.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.433
He kind of had to do it. It's,
like, the nature of the show.

23:07.433 --> 23:09.800
Look out, bud.
Sorry. Is that Jeter?

23:12.767 --> 23:14.167
What show was it?

23:14.167 --> 23:16.067
It's called
"Impractical Jokers."

23:16.067 --> 23:18.067
-Ohh!
-Oh, I know that show.

23:18.067 --> 23:20.433
-Oh, my God!

23:20.433 --> 23:22.700
Yeah. It was
"Impractical Jokers."

23:22.700 --> 23:25.733
-Oh, my God.
-That was Joe.

23:25.733 --> 23:28.167
Oh. Oh, my God!
I had no idea!

23:28.167 --> 23:30.400
You didn't know?
Now does it make sense?

23:30.400 --> 23:33.700
Yeah, now that makes sense.
That's funny.

23:33.700 --> 23:36.767
Q: Murr, turn left.
There you go.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.300
Look at his nipples.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.600
-Come on. I know.
-Sundial shadow.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.233
Joe: Guys, it's 12:35.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.467
I've never seen
anything like that.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.833
Your nipples cast
a shadow on your body.

23:48.833 --> 23:51.967
Q: Your nipples have
their own shadow.

23:51.967 --> 23:54.200
I was born with
big nipples. What?
