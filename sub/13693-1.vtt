WEBVTT

00:22.509 --> 00:26.721
My father's dream
was that Glenbogle
would be great again.

00:26.805 --> 00:30.350
One way would have been
to avoid saddling us with
a mountain of death duties

00:30.432 --> 00:32.894
but never mind.

00:32.978 --> 00:38.316
So, we are gonna
give the paying public
what they most desire.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.861
A glimpse of the dark side.

00:43.154 --> 00:45.991
LEXIE: The Glenbogle wolves.

00:46.074 --> 00:48.076
They'll be the biggest draw
in the Highlands.

00:48.159 --> 00:50.578
We'll get visitors
by the coach load.

00:50.662 --> 00:54.291
Take more than a few wolves
to raise the kind
of money we need.

00:54.374 --> 00:58.795
How does The Glenbogle
Wildlife Centre sound?

00:58.878 --> 01:03.258
Bison,
wild horses, native birds,
brought back to the Highlands.

01:03.341 --> 01:06.553
Well, I hate to think what
your mother will say
when she gets back.

01:36.124 --> 01:38.960
Oh, dear,
is my hair a terrible mess?

02:20.794 --> 02:24.130
My dear brother
sends his love.
Especially to you, Lexie.

02:24.214 --> 02:25.674
How is Jolyon?

02:25.757 --> 02:27.884
Oh, he's doing rather well.
He's broken into green beans.

02:27.968 --> 02:31.304
I think he's going to
stay in Kenya for good.
Not that I saw much of him.

02:31.388 --> 02:33.974
White water rafting,
elephant tracking,

02:34.057 --> 02:36.768
there is so much to do
for the lone traveller.

02:36.851 --> 02:38.436
And the journey?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.314
I bought an old jeep
and drove to Morocco.

02:41.398 --> 02:43.316
But that's across
the Sahara Desert.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.152
You'd hardly expect me
not to notice.

02:46.236 --> 02:47.779
And what happened to the jeep?

02:47.862 --> 02:50.740
It got stolen in Tangier
along with the money,
everything.

02:50.824 --> 02:54.119
Then an old friend who'd moved
to the Costas for
professional reasons,

02:54.202 --> 02:56.329
gave me a lift
in his Tiger Moth.

02:56.413 --> 02:58.331
You flew all
the way home in that?

02:58.415 --> 03:01.376
Well, very nearly,
but the coastguards
fished us out of the drink

03:01.459 --> 03:03.128
and here I am.

03:03.211 --> 03:07.507
Oh, I've missed this
old place. And you.

03:13.805 --> 03:17.142
It's your home,
Molly, it's where you belong.

03:17.225 --> 03:21.104
Come on, Lexie,
you must fill me
in on all the news.

03:21.187 --> 03:24.566
Well, nothing much has really
been happening, you know what
it's like around here.

03:27.694 --> 03:30.614
Well, you ready for
the big day tomorrow, Golly?

03:30.697 --> 03:32.449
Do I have to sit an exam?

03:32.532 --> 03:34.159
No, just the head keeper.

03:34.242 --> 03:38.204
The guy's name is Burns,
and we only open
on his say so.

03:38.288 --> 03:42.500
Glenbogle's
future in the hands
of a zoo inspector?

03:42.584 --> 03:46.046
Oh, the new wolf's
arriving tomorrow. She'll need
collecting at the station.

03:46.129 --> 03:49.257
That sounds like
a job for the head keeper.

04:00.685 --> 04:04.856
That's the alpha female.
The only one with cubs.

04:04.939 --> 04:09.069
-She's magnificent.
-Why don't you away in
and get a closer look?

04:12.614 --> 04:16.826
We're not supposed
to get too close.
It frightens them.

04:16.910 --> 04:17.911
Ah.

04:21.456 --> 04:25.377
You know, Archie's right,
loads of people are
gonna come and see these.

04:25.459 --> 04:28.337
-Trippers, yes.
-As long as they
pay the entrance fee.

04:28.421 --> 04:30.840
Is that all anyone
cares about any more?

04:30.924 --> 04:34.928
Like the boss said,
this estate's going
to be great again.

04:35.011 --> 04:39.057
No, Duncan,
it might be a rich estate,
there's a difference.

04:47.148 --> 04:48.942
Where's Mother?

04:49.025 --> 04:54.531
Probably up to her
neck in hot water.
She really is something, eh?

04:54.614 --> 04:57.784
-So are you.
-Don't.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.705
What's the matter?

05:01.788 --> 05:06.376
Now that Molly's back,
it just feels
like I'm taking over.

05:06.459 --> 05:10.505
Well, you are, Lex.
You're gonna be
the next Lady of Glenbogle.

05:10.588 --> 05:13.967
And Mother will
be only too happy
to pass the mantle on.

05:14.050 --> 05:16.678
Molly's always been
really good to me.

05:16.761 --> 05:18.763
You know,
it can't be easy for her,

05:18.847 --> 05:21.349
just watching a new model
moving in.

05:24.185 --> 05:27.355
I just don't feel good
about it, that's all.

05:28.148 --> 05:29.441
Well, I do.

05:38.116 --> 05:42.412
Are you sure that you should
be cuddling the housekeeper,
your Lairdship?

05:44.164 --> 05:46.166
-What?
-Oh, nothing, nothing.

05:46.249 --> 05:49.586
Just reminded me of
a little surprise, that's all.

05:49.669 --> 05:52.088
Ooh, will I like it?

05:54.215 --> 05:59.137
-I thought we said no secrets.
-Yeah, but that's
once we're married.

05:59.220 --> 06:03.308
Look, you know I don't want
to rush you into anything...

06:03.391 --> 06:06.519
-But...
-But, um...

06:07.896 --> 06:09.272
No, nothing, nothing.

06:14.986 --> 06:16.404
Oh!

06:16.488 --> 06:19.366
-Can I help you?
-I was looking
for the kitchen.

06:19.449 --> 06:20.951
Why?

06:21.034 --> 06:24.663
-Are you Mrs MacDonald?
-No, not yet.

06:24.746 --> 06:28.583
I'm sorry for just walking in,
there was no one around
and the door was open.

06:28.667 --> 06:32.253
-So, who are you?
-I'm Irene Stuart.

06:33.964 --> 06:35.840
The new cook and housekeeper.

06:53.233 --> 06:55.527
What is that woman
doing in my kitchen?

06:55.610 --> 06:57.904
Who? Oh, she's arrived.
Good.

06:57.988 --> 07:00.156
This your surprise?

07:00.240 --> 07:03.201
Listen, I really appreciate
how you've looked after us
over the last few months.

07:03.285 --> 07:05.661
-Appreciate?
-Carrying on as if
nothing had changed.

07:05.745 --> 07:09.124
-I really had no right to ask.
-I'm the housekeeper.

07:09.207 --> 07:12.210
I've hired Irene to run
the Wildlife Centre catering

07:12.294 --> 07:14.421
and I thought she could do
the housekeeping as well.

07:14.504 --> 07:17.882
(SCOFFS) Over my dead body.

07:17.966 --> 07:19.843
Why, what's the matter?
I thought you'd be pleased.

07:19.926 --> 07:22.262
You never even
thought to ask me first?

07:22.345 --> 07:24.097
But then it wouldn't
have been a surprise,
would it?

07:24.180 --> 07:26.391
-If we're gonna be married...
-If's right.

07:26.474 --> 07:30.562
When we're gonna be married,
you can't carry on being
the housekeeper, can you?

07:30.645 --> 07:32.856
It was a housekeeper
you proposed to.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.816
And it was the laird
that you accepted.

07:34.899 --> 07:38.069
Oh, so this is
a taste of what being
Mrs Laird's like, is it?

07:38.153 --> 07:40.905
I think I'll stay as I am,
thank you very much.

07:40.989 --> 07:44.701
I need you with me,
we've an estate to run,
we have staff to look after.

07:44.784 --> 07:46.661
And this is how you
look after your staff?

07:46.745 --> 07:49.623
-But you're not staff.
-Then what am I?

07:49.706 --> 07:52.542
You're part of
the management team now.

07:52.626 --> 07:54.461
I want to share everything
with you,

07:54.544 --> 07:56.838
the running of the estate,
the hiring, the firing.

07:56.921 --> 08:00.050
Right, okay, I'll start
off with whatsherface, then.

08:00.133 --> 08:04.971
I can hire and fire with
the best of them, Arch.
Especially fire.

08:05.055 --> 08:09.434
-Lex.
-Only if it's important.
I'm management now.

08:11.853 --> 08:16.775
Well, that's that sorted.
Seems to be some
misunderstanding.

08:16.858 --> 08:19.444
-Oh?
-See, the post's filled.

08:19.527 --> 08:22.822
But I've come all this way.
It was agreed
with Mr MacDonald.

08:22.906 --> 08:24.574
Sorry.

08:24.658 --> 08:27.452
-Well, I'd better
take this up with him.
-No need.

08:27.535 --> 08:29.454
If he's given
the job to someone else...

08:29.537 --> 08:33.375
He didn't. I'm the cook,
so there's no vacancy.

08:33.457 --> 08:35.835
Mr MacDonald made me
an offer in writing,

08:35.919 --> 08:39.798
you might want to brush up on
your employment law
before you go any further.

08:43.551 --> 08:49.057
See, I don't think you
would like it here anyway,
they're a right difficult lot.

08:49.140 --> 08:52.268
Most of the chefs I've worked
with are a right
difficult lot on a good day.

08:52.352 --> 08:54.729
I mean, they're on
your back day and night...

08:54.813 --> 08:57.565
You've obviously never
worked in a top hotel.

08:57.648 --> 09:00.652
-And I suppose you have.
-The Grand Lothian.

09:02.112 --> 09:04.614
Not the Grand Lothian?

09:06.408 --> 09:08.118
Did you get
tired of peeling veg?

09:08.201 --> 09:10.870
I was the sous chef.
That means I was
in charge of...

09:10.954 --> 09:13.498
Yes, I know what that means.

09:13.581 --> 09:16.918
-You've come
down in the world.
-I needed a new challenge.

09:17.877 --> 09:20.255
Right.

09:20.338 --> 09:25.552
You see,
people only come to Glenbogle
for two reasons.

09:25.635 --> 09:28.054
One is to deliver
a final demand,

09:28.138 --> 09:29.973
and the other is to get away
from something.

09:30.056 --> 09:31.891
-I told you...
-Or someone.

09:31.975 --> 09:34.936
-I needed a new challenge.
-A challenge. Right.

09:37.147 --> 09:39.941
Well, Irene Stuart,
you've completed
your first challenge,

09:40.025 --> 09:42.110
you have found the kitchen.

09:43.945 --> 09:46.740
I thought this would
be for the tourists.
"How we used to live."

09:46.823 --> 09:50.744
No, this would be for us,
the way we live now.

09:50.827 --> 09:52.954
It has character.

09:53.038 --> 09:55.999
Well, so does the Bates Motel
but you wouldn't
want to cook in it.

09:56.082 --> 09:58.960
If you show me to my room,
I'll get changed.

09:59.544 --> 10:02.297
Your room? Okay.

10:07.052 --> 10:10.639
I'm asking you to
set a few traps,
they're only rabbits.

10:10.722 --> 10:13.266
It would help
the feeding budget go further.

10:13.350 --> 10:15.644
They'll just have
to catch their own.

10:15.727 --> 10:19.105
On this estate an animal dies
either from a clean
shot or from old age.

10:19.189 --> 10:21.149
Look, you and Duncan,
you both do the training,

10:21.232 --> 10:23.026
you know what has to be done,
you know what's at stake.

10:23.109 --> 10:26.112
I will help you, Archie,
but as a gillie,
not as a butcher.

10:27.656 --> 10:30.450
Fine.

10:30.533 --> 10:34.579
Before you walk away
we have a season's
shooting to start planning.

10:34.663 --> 10:37.290
Look,
I respect your principles,

10:37.374 --> 10:38.917
and I'm not gonna ask you
to go against them,

10:39.000 --> 10:43.338
but I really do believe
that the Wildlife
Park is the future.

10:43.421 --> 10:45.090
That's your plan, is it?

10:45.173 --> 10:48.385
To phase out
the traditional sports
in favour of a zoo?

10:48.468 --> 10:51.096
We make decent enough money
from the game parties,

10:51.179 --> 10:52.973
I'm not arguing with that.

10:53.056 --> 10:56.017
But, if, when,
the Wildlife Park takes off,

10:56.101 --> 10:58.311
then, yes,
the emphasis will change.

10:58.395 --> 11:00.105
I see.

11:00.188 --> 11:03.358
-As I said...
-Yes, yes, ideas develop.
Yes, you said.

11:03.441 --> 11:06.903
This is a far cry
from a few wolves
to please the punters, Archie.

11:06.987 --> 11:09.447
What you're talking about
is the slow death
of a way of life

11:09.531 --> 11:12.701
that this estate has
depended on for generations.

11:14.536 --> 11:17.497
I'll not be party to that.

11:17.580 --> 11:19.958
What about the inspector,
the head keeper's exam?

11:20.041 --> 11:24.296
Let me ask you something here.
Would your father have
gone along with this?

11:24.379 --> 11:26.214
-Nope.
-No.

11:26.298 --> 11:28.300
Then how, in all
good conscience, can I?

11:28.383 --> 11:32.220
Well, that all depends
where your loyalties lie,
with him or with me.

11:37.809 --> 11:41.438
I'll have Lexie
liaise with you
over booking the shoots.

11:46.484 --> 11:48.862
How's it going, Dunc?

11:48.945 --> 11:51.948
One electric fence,
fitted and working.

11:52.032 --> 11:54.409
-Have they been fed today?
-Golly does that.

11:54.492 --> 11:56.911
Not any more.

11:56.995 --> 12:00.540
-That exam.
-Head keepers only, you said.

12:00.624 --> 12:03.043
As of 10 minutes ago,
you are the head keeper.

12:03.126 --> 12:05.837
-That's Golly's job.
-He won't do it.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.631
-Why not?
-He has his reasons

12:07.714 --> 12:11.259
-but it's you that
I'm interested in.
-Oh, I don't know.

12:11.343 --> 12:14.012
It's a big promotion.
More money.

12:15.930 --> 12:18.308
Company PlayStation.

12:21.102 --> 12:22.646
It wouldn't be right.

12:22.729 --> 12:26.316
There's no one else I can ask,
believe me, if there was, I...

12:26.399 --> 12:29.861
I wouldn't put you
in this morally,
ambiguous position.

12:31.529 --> 12:35.241
-What about the exam thing?
-It's your big chance.

12:36.910 --> 12:40.121
-Head keeper.
-You'd best start work.

12:41.915 --> 12:44.626
-I won't let you down.
-I know you'll do your best.

12:51.549 --> 12:52.926
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

13:03.728 --> 13:06.272
I shouldn't have gone away
at a time like that, but...

13:06.356 --> 13:08.024
No.

13:08.108 --> 13:11.903
You did
absolutely the right thing,
I totally understand.

13:11.987 --> 13:14.948
And those beastly
death duties still to face.

13:15.031 --> 13:18.952
Yes, 200 grand. You'd think
they'd name
a hospital after him for that.

13:19.035 --> 13:22.122
A ward at the very least.

13:22.205 --> 13:25.917
Em... I thought we might eat
in the dining room tonight.

13:26.001 --> 13:27.544
Where have you been eating?

13:29.087 --> 13:30.714
The kitchen.

13:30.797 --> 13:34.009
You'll have your
father haunting you
as a class traitor.

13:34.092 --> 13:38.346
Well, I wanted you to be here
before we
re-opened the dining room.

13:38.430 --> 13:41.725
Don't stand on
ceremony for me.
Eat where you like.

13:42.851 --> 13:46.479
-The dining room, then.
-As you wish.

13:49.357 --> 13:53.236
-I missed you, Archie.
-I missed you too, Mother.

14:03.330 --> 14:06.291
Who are you?

14:06.374 --> 14:09.044
-Who's asking?
-And what are you
doing in my freezer?

14:09.127 --> 14:12.172
-Your freezer?
-Can't you say anything
that isn't a question?

14:13.506 --> 14:14.841
Can't you?

14:15.759 --> 14:18.261
I'm the housekeeper.

14:18.345 --> 14:20.722
-No, you're not.
-I'm the new housekeeper.

14:20.805 --> 14:22.015
Which brings us back to you.

14:22.932 --> 14:25.435
I'm Duncan. The head...

14:25.518 --> 14:28.855
The Head Keeper of
the Glenbogle Wildlife Centre.

14:28.938 --> 14:34.235
Hmm. Pleased to meet you,
Duncan. It's Irene.

14:34.319 --> 14:37.155
Head keeper,
that's quite a job.
You've been doing it long?

14:37.238 --> 14:41.618
-Aye.
-Now,
what can I get you to eat?

14:41.701 --> 14:44.955
You wouldn't
have a few rabbits
kicking about, would you?

14:45.038 --> 14:50.001
-A few?
-Yeah, say, 20.

14:50.085 --> 14:53.380
Golly normally feeds
the wolves, and I don't know
where he gets it.

14:53.463 --> 14:56.883
-Ask.
-I can't ask...

14:56.967 --> 14:59.552
I have to work
this out for myself.

14:59.636 --> 15:01.721
I doubt he feeds them
from the kitchen freezer,

15:01.805 --> 15:03.264
there must be
a local game dealer.

15:03.348 --> 15:05.517
Yeah,
and I can afford his prices.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.144
Aren't there any poachers
left in the Highlands?

15:08.228 --> 15:10.939
Well, yeah, there's old
Tommy the Shepherd but...

15:12.816 --> 15:16.236
Your chance remark
might have saved the day.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.827
My dear Molly.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.539
Kilwillie.

15:27.622 --> 15:31.876
Home at last
from Afric shores.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.630
Oh, Molly, what a hollow
shell this world can seem

15:35.714 --> 15:38.008
when the sweetest
nut has been removed.

15:38.091 --> 15:40.927
Yes. Dear Hector.

15:41.011 --> 15:42.512
Hmm?

15:42.595 --> 15:45.765
Oh, Hector, yes.

15:45.849 --> 15:48.059
Glenbogle will feel
rather lonely, I dare say.

15:48.143 --> 15:52.939
Well, I've got Archie
and Lexie and the boys,
and you, of course.

15:53.023 --> 15:57.694
-At your service.
-Who could possibly be lonely?

15:57.777 --> 16:00.196
I've been
admiring Archie's wolves.

16:00.280 --> 16:05.410
-Mmm, so many changes.
-Too many, perhaps?

16:05.493 --> 16:08.747
Well,
I intend to make some myself,
starting tomorrow.

16:08.830 --> 16:11.458
Oh, can I help?
Extra pair of hands?

16:11.541 --> 16:14.336
-Would you?
-I'll be around first
thing in the morning.

16:14.419 --> 16:17.130
Shall we say, um, 11:30?

16:17.213 --> 16:20.425
Yes, quite early
enough for a gentleman.

16:29.017 --> 16:34.731
No rabbits I'll grant you,
but I doubt your wolves'll
turn their noses up, eh?

16:37.817 --> 16:40.987
Well, it doesn't say
they can't eat fish.

16:43.114 --> 16:45.825
-Fresh are they, Tommy?
-Aye.

16:47.452 --> 16:50.497
-They're not ours, are they?
-No.

17:04.426 --> 17:07.973
You want to watch that water,
it could scald you
straight from the tap.

17:08.056 --> 17:09.223
I will.

17:12.602 --> 17:15.855
And that oven runs
at 10 degrees cool.

17:15.939 --> 17:18.483
Only nine, I checked.

17:24.030 --> 17:26.156
You'll find the silver
cutlery in the dresser.

17:26.241 --> 17:31.162
It was in dire
need of a good clean,
as was the dining room.

17:31.246 --> 17:34.582
Yeah, this ring, you'll find
it a bit slow if you're used
to cooking with gas.

17:34.666 --> 17:36.918
I've cooked on everything.

17:37.002 --> 17:38.670
So, any more questions?

17:38.753 --> 17:42.465
No, thank you. Dinner
will be at 8:00. Until then.

17:59.316 --> 18:00.441
Fetch!

18:03.069 --> 18:06.323
They like salmon,
Dunc, but not grilled.

18:06.405 --> 18:09.533
I just thought I'd
try something different.

18:09.618 --> 18:14.039
Look, I know this
is controversial, but why not
use the feeding tube?

18:14.122 --> 18:15.915
I was just away to.

18:22.464 --> 18:24.257
Where did you get these?

18:24.341 --> 18:27.636
I've got my sources,
Archie, I've got my sources.

18:27.719 --> 18:30.639
-They are fresh?
-Oh, aye.

18:31.848 --> 18:34.851
-They are ours, yes?
-Yes.

18:57.916 --> 19:02.337
Ooh,
Badger, lay out my dungarees
for tomorrow, will you?

19:02.420 --> 19:06.049
I don't imagine we
possess dungarees,
your Lordship.

19:06.132 --> 19:08.593
Then something
appropriate for manual labour.

19:08.677 --> 19:10.220
Very good, my lord.

19:10.303 --> 19:11.930
-Oh, Badger.
-My lord?

19:12.013 --> 19:14.557
I may have a guest for
dinner tomorrow night.

19:14.641 --> 19:17.310
Make sure the dining
room is well set out.

19:17.394 --> 19:20.438
What hour can we expect
the gentleman, my lord?

19:21.231 --> 19:25.360
The gentleman is a lady.

19:25.443 --> 19:28.446
I'm sorry, but I can't get
excited over a bunch
of howling dogs

19:28.530 --> 19:30.323
taking over the estate.

19:30.407 --> 19:33.201
They lived here for centuries
before they were
hunted into extinction,

19:33.285 --> 19:35.870
I think it would
be nice for people
to see them back in the glen.

19:35.954 --> 19:37.956
In a pound, though, eh?

19:38.039 --> 19:39.958
So be it,

19:40.041 --> 19:43.044
and seeing how they're native,
surely they can survive
without my assistance.

19:51.886 --> 19:55.140
-You look the part.
-GOLLY: That you do, lass.

19:55.223 --> 19:59.769
-Well,
looks aren't everything.
-They certainly help, though.

19:59.853 --> 20:04.107
I think I'd be more use
in the kitchen. You know,
in a managerial sense.

20:04.190 --> 20:07.068
No, I'm quite certain
it's all under control.

20:07.152 --> 20:10.280
-Do you want a drink?
-I'm not in the mood.

20:15.660 --> 20:17.829
Something the matter?

20:17.912 --> 20:20.540
No, Molly, you look great.

20:21.499 --> 20:25.670
Thank you. Golly, the pipes.

20:25.754 --> 20:28.006
As you say, Molly.

20:28.089 --> 20:32.010
Oh, I am absolutely starving.

20:32.093 --> 20:35.096
-Mother, please.
-Sweetheart.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.654
Duncan, would you?

20:52.614 --> 20:53.740
Thank you.

20:54.866 --> 20:56.743
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

21:17.555 --> 21:20.433
Oh, no,
no, Lexie, you must sit here.

21:20.517 --> 21:22.519
But that's your place, Molly.

21:22.602 --> 21:25.021
I'm so hungry,
I've lost the will to argue.

21:28.358 --> 21:31.152
Archie,
you must sit here, of course.

21:33.029 --> 21:34.239
Come on.

21:44.582 --> 21:49.087
Come on, boys, don't
stand on ceremony, sit down.

21:49.879 --> 21:50.964
Join us.

21:55.093 --> 21:58.972
Oh, Duncan,
I'm dying for a drink,
would you pour?

22:00.598 --> 22:02.058
You won't believe this,

22:02.142 --> 22:05.562
but that helicopter didn't
even have a drinks trolley.

22:08.064 --> 22:11.860
Ah, that's better.
We're all here, dear friends,

22:11.943 --> 22:16.781
we must count every blessing
and cherish every moment.

22:18.742 --> 22:19.993
Thank you.

22:23.121 --> 22:24.539
Good choice, Archie.

22:26.666 --> 22:29.753
Ah, supper.

22:29.836 --> 22:33.465
Ooh, and what treat have
you got in store for us?

22:33.548 --> 22:37.177
-Irene, isn't it?
-Yes, Mrs MacDonald.

22:37.260 --> 22:40.472
It's seared sea trout
with a chicory
flavoured tender sauerkraut

22:40.555 --> 22:42.599
and a red wine jus.

22:42.682 --> 22:44.434
It looks absolutely...

22:46.311 --> 22:47.562
fine.

22:51.441 --> 22:52.692
Bon appetit.

22:59.407 --> 23:00.867
(SIGHING)

23:09.709 --> 23:12.253
-Well?
-Very good.

23:14.172 --> 23:16.758
Of, it's kind, of course.

23:16.841 --> 23:19.511
-Is everything all right?
-Excellent, Irene.

23:19.594 --> 23:22.430
Mmm, aye.

23:25.350 --> 23:29.980
Yeah, well, if the main
course is as good as that,
I'll be well satisfied.

23:30.063 --> 23:32.482
(WHISPERING) That
was the main course.

23:37.279 --> 23:40.323
I'm terribly sorry.

23:41.408 --> 23:42.867
I meant no offence.

23:44.202 --> 23:46.913
Well, I'm full.

24:03.263 --> 24:05.849
-Will you give it a rest?
-The exam's tomorrow.

24:07.392 --> 24:10.186
I wanna be head keeper,
even if you don't.

24:10.270 --> 24:12.939
What brought this on?

24:13.023 --> 24:16.610
I've always played
second fiddle to you,
ever since I can remember.

24:16.693 --> 24:20.030
It's not that I'm complaining,
mind, I don't have
your experience,

24:20.113 --> 24:21.906
I'm not a gillie,

24:21.990 --> 24:25.493
but I could be a head keeper.

24:25.577 --> 24:27.996
You don't think being
scared to death
of the creatures

24:28.079 --> 24:30.248
is just a wee bit of
a disadvantage, no?

24:30.332 --> 24:32.125
I'm not scared.

24:32.208 --> 24:39.341
I'm in the process of
forming a relationship
based on mutual respect.

24:39.424 --> 24:42.719
Well, they haven't
eaten you yet, I suppose.

24:42.802 --> 24:45.513
Why don't you
just put that down
and get something inside you?

24:45.597 --> 24:46.890
You must be
as hungry as I am.

24:46.973 --> 24:48.975
I thought dinner
was very tasty.

24:49.059 --> 24:51.811
Oh,
that kind of modern fanciness
has no place round here.

24:51.895 --> 24:55.982
You could give her a chance.
You might get to like her.

24:56.066 --> 25:00.654
Well, if her heart's
as big as her portions,
I seriously doubt it.

25:00.737 --> 25:03.490
-She's good looking, though.
-Mmm.

25:04.741 --> 25:07.452
Too old for me, eh, Golly?

25:07.535 --> 25:10.497
Old?
That makes me prehistoric.

25:10.580 --> 25:13.959
Get away,
you're in your prime.

25:14.042 --> 25:16.086
-Where are you going?
-The wolf pound.

25:16.169 --> 25:20.173
-It'll be dark soon.
-A head keeper's
place is with his charges,

25:20.256 --> 25:22.676
not stuffing his face
with bread and cheese.

25:29.516 --> 25:32.310
If you were gonna go behind
my back, you might as well
have hired someone

25:32.394 --> 25:34.062
that could turn
out a decent meal.

25:34.145 --> 25:37.440
You're her manager, Lex,
why don't you
take it up with her?

25:37.524 --> 25:40.151
Because I didn't
bring her here.

25:40.235 --> 25:43.113
I had hoped that you
might give her a chance.

25:43.196 --> 25:47.117
What, like you hoped Golly
would welcome your grand
plan with open arms?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.994
Get real, Arch.

25:49.077 --> 25:53.873
I am getting real.
I'm about the only
one around here who is.

25:53.957 --> 25:57.252
If those wolves don't
pay off then we're sunk,
is that real enough for you?

25:57.335 --> 25:59.963
And you don't
care who you tread on
in your progress march?

26:00.046 --> 26:02.132
I offered Golly a job,
but he turned it down.

26:02.215 --> 26:06.052
No, you asked Golly to change
his whole way of
life overnight.

26:06.136 --> 26:08.638
Now, we're getting to it.

26:08.722 --> 26:12.309
-At least Golly had
a chance to say no.
-Meaning?

26:12.392 --> 26:14.978
Meaning you can't ask people
to be something that
they're not, Arch,

26:15.061 --> 26:16.938
just because you want it.

26:17.022 --> 26:21.610
Look, Lex, things are
bound to be different.
We're talking about marriage.

26:21.693 --> 26:24.237
No, you're
talking about marriage.

26:28.825 --> 26:31.077
What are you doing?

26:31.161 --> 26:33.455
I'm just gonna move
back into my own room.

26:35.498 --> 26:36.875
Just for now, eh?

27:07.781 --> 27:10.867
-Hi.
-Oh, are you starving, too?

27:10.951 --> 27:13.370
No, not really. Here,
sit down, I'll get that.

27:13.453 --> 27:18.208
Poor Irene. She'll have
to beef up our portions
or we'll all fade away.

27:18.291 --> 27:22.671
It's the modern way,
you can't teach
a new dog old tricks.

27:22.754 --> 27:25.131
Isn't it an old
dog new tricks?

27:25.215 --> 27:28.093
Works both ways.

27:28.176 --> 27:30.303
Now, here we are.

27:32.263 --> 27:35.058
There. Now back your cart in.

27:35.141 --> 27:37.769
Oh, pardon, bon appetit.

27:39.270 --> 27:42.107
-Would you like some?
-No, I'm fine.

27:44.985 --> 27:46.444
You know, Lexie dear,

27:46.528 --> 27:49.739
it takes time to get used
to a new role, it isn't easy.

27:49.823 --> 27:52.200
When you've been
the housekeeper?

27:52.284 --> 27:55.203
All families need new blood.

27:55.287 --> 27:58.581
Yeah, well,
life used to be so certain.

27:58.665 --> 28:01.543
I used to be able to
read all the signs and now,

28:02.711 --> 28:05.046
now I can't even see one.

28:05.130 --> 28:09.843
Golly's finding it hard,
too, and so is Archie.
He's lost his father remember.

28:09.926 --> 28:12.637
And I've been useless.

28:12.721 --> 28:15.807
Hector didn't
cast a giant shadow

28:15.890 --> 28:19.394
but he did
provide a little shade,
and now he's gone...

28:19.477 --> 28:21.187
Archie's feeling the heat.

28:21.271 --> 28:24.482
Everything depends on
him now and his plans.

28:26.735 --> 28:29.321
-Are things all
right between you?
-What?

28:30.405 --> 28:31.906
Yeah. Yeah.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.588
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

28:48.965 --> 28:50.008
Lex?

28:55.055 --> 28:57.682
What time is it?

28:57.766 --> 29:01.227
I'm on my way out,
just thought I'd
see if you were okay.

29:01.311 --> 29:03.647
-I'll get you some breakfast.
-No, no, no.

29:03.730 --> 29:07.192
-You can't go out
on an empty stomach.
-I'm fine, really.

29:07.275 --> 29:09.402
It'll take me five minutes.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.863
Irene was about.
She did me some eggs.

29:13.365 --> 29:14.407
Oh.

29:15.992 --> 29:17.827
So you don't need me, then.

29:20.538 --> 29:22.082
Of course I do.

29:28.296 --> 29:30.507
I'd better go and see
to the wolves, then.

29:41.810 --> 29:45.563
DUNCAN: She's not eating.
She hasn't moved in ages.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.733
You sure about that salmon?

29:48.817 --> 29:51.111
He said it was fresh.

29:51.194 --> 29:53.822
Well, something's
troubling her, poor thing.

29:55.699 --> 29:59.995
Perhaps... Perhaps she knows
that the new female's coming

30:00.078 --> 30:03.123
and she's feeling
a bit not wanted.

30:03.206 --> 30:06.835
They're not people, Dunc.
Don't anthropomorphise.

30:06.918 --> 30:08.795
I try not to, boss.

30:08.878 --> 30:11.131
Listen, you'll have
to get your skates on
after the exam.

30:11.214 --> 30:13.717
The handler'll meet
you at the station
with the wolf.

30:15.010 --> 30:16.803
She'll be in a travelling box.

30:16.886 --> 30:20.473
Aye, right, no problem.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.600
They don't attack people,
Duncan, you know that.

30:22.684 --> 30:26.229
Not in the pack,
but this one's on her own.

30:26.313 --> 30:29.065
The lone wolf is
an entirely different story.

30:29.149 --> 30:32.736
She won't be alone, will she?
You'll be there.

30:39.075 --> 30:40.285
Morning.

30:41.786 --> 30:43.538
-Did you sleep well?
-Eventually.

30:43.622 --> 30:46.916
Whilst someone was up
and about frying sausages.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.712
Don't take it personally,
it's just the way you
were taught how to cook.

30:50.795 --> 30:55.091
I was taught the basic good
manners of not invading
another person's work space.

30:55.175 --> 30:57.010
I'll bear that in mind.

30:57.093 --> 30:59.846
That's... That's me away.

30:59.929 --> 31:03.099
I thought maybe I'd bring back
a couple of rabbits.

31:03.183 --> 31:05.769
Would that be
a peace offering?

31:05.852 --> 31:10.398
It is the finest food
in creation if it's, you know,
if it's cooked properly.

31:10.482 --> 31:13.443
(SCOFFS) And what are
you going to treat us to?

31:13.526 --> 31:18.657
A wee slice of
rabbit on some bruschetta
with a drizzle of vinaigrette?

31:18.740 --> 31:20.742
How would rabbit pie
be for lunch?

31:20.825 --> 31:22.535
Would that get us off
on the right foot?

31:22.619 --> 31:25.914
Aye, that would
suit me fine, Irene.

31:25.997 --> 31:29.501
Well,
you off and do your job then,
and I'll do mine.

31:32.879 --> 31:35.840
Don't try and
cook native, Irene.
Just stick to what you know.

31:35.924 --> 31:38.301
You think I can't
manage a simple rabbit pie?

31:38.385 --> 31:41.721
A complicated one maybe.
A simple one, I doubt it.

31:41.805 --> 31:43.306
We'll see about that,
won't we?

31:43.390 --> 31:45.934
I'll cook lunch.
I'll not see good food ruined.

31:46.017 --> 31:48.186
-Ruined?
-Yes, ruined.

31:49.229 --> 31:51.231
What's going on?

31:51.314 --> 31:54.484
-Just girly talk.
-Talk?
I could hear it in the hall.

31:54.567 --> 31:58.321
This person seems to think
she's a better cook than I am.

31:58.405 --> 32:01.283
I only suggested
I cook rabbit pie.

32:01.366 --> 32:03.743
-I am the cook.
-Were the cook!

32:03.827 --> 32:06.997
-Are you firing me?
-No one's firing anyone.

32:07.747 --> 32:10.000
So, who's to cook lunch?

32:11.459 --> 32:13.461
Irene, perhaps under
the circumstances...

32:13.545 --> 32:15.839
You hired me to be the cook,
Mr MacDonald.

32:17.465 --> 32:21.386
-She's right, Lex.
-That's it, take her side.

32:21.469 --> 32:24.681
Do you know, there are too
many ifs and maybes in my
life at the moment,

32:24.764 --> 32:27.183
this one gets
sorted out right now.

32:27.267 --> 32:30.520
I'll tell you who's
gonna cook. You both are.

32:30.603 --> 32:34.232
For the title
housekeeper/cook of Glenbogle.

32:34.316 --> 32:37.027
Irene, if you lose,
there's still a job for you
at the Wildlife Centre.

32:37.110 --> 32:39.571
Lose? In her dreams.

32:41.865 --> 32:43.241
Who'll judge?

32:43.325 --> 32:48.413
We all will, democracy rules.
Rabbit pies at 10 paces.

32:48.496 --> 32:50.123
The Laird has spoken.

32:50.790 --> 32:52.208
Come on, dogs.

33:02.802 --> 33:04.888
We can't have
all this clutter.

33:06.473 --> 33:08.558
There's no hurry.

33:08.642 --> 33:12.062
No better time
to spring clean,
throw open the windows

33:12.145 --> 33:14.689
and get some fresh
air into Glenbogle.

33:16.775 --> 33:18.860
I thought Father had left
all his clothes to Duncan.

33:18.944 --> 33:24.115
Yes, he did. He's taken what
he wants, the rest are going
to the charity shop.

33:24.199 --> 33:27.786
It's about time your
father did something
for the deserving poor.

33:27.869 --> 33:31.331
Now that he's
not here to object.

33:31.414 --> 33:35.001
-Are you taking all of it?
-Every last jot and tittle.

33:36.378 --> 33:39.381
I'm glad Monty and
Rommel have taken it so well.

33:39.464 --> 33:42.300
Poor little Useless.

33:42.384 --> 33:46.012
They take me for
a walk every day.
Always the same...

33:48.431 --> 33:50.016
The same route.

33:51.184 --> 33:53.061
Old habits die hard.

34:25.176 --> 34:29.639
-Am I intruding?
-Of course not,
and dressed for action I see.

34:29.723 --> 34:34.018
Well, I'm not one of those who
thinks that manual labour
is a Spanish butler.

34:35.812 --> 34:37.438
Spam?

34:37.522 --> 34:40.483
Hector took the nuclear
threat very seriously.

34:40.567 --> 34:42.985
There's enough under the bed
to feed a small army.

34:43.069 --> 34:44.737
Or a small village, perhaps.

34:44.821 --> 34:47.616
What about Glenbogle.
Noblesse oblige.

34:48.658 --> 34:52.161
-A stack of these, too.
-Ahh.

34:52.245 --> 34:57.000
A full stomach and
a hearty chuckle,
isn't that just like Hector?

34:57.083 --> 35:00.211
He wanted you to have these,
you always admired them.

35:00.295 --> 35:02.297
I shall wear them with pride.

35:02.380 --> 35:07.052
They fitted him like
the day they were made.
He kept his figure to the end.

35:12.891 --> 35:15.644
What a blessing to
be a small-boned man.

35:19.272 --> 35:21.024
What's the book?

35:22.901 --> 35:26.571
I've got an exam
this afternoon.
Head keeper business.

35:26.655 --> 35:27.906
Oh, you'll be okay.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.617
I'm not good at exams.

35:32.827 --> 35:37.207
I mean, I liked,
I was good at history,
but when it came to the exam,

35:37.289 --> 35:41.336
I didn't even
remember how long
the Hundred Years' War lasted.

35:41.418 --> 35:44.464
Like cooking,
it's all in the preparation.

35:44.546 --> 35:46.215
Give me the book.

35:46.299 --> 35:48.677
And I've got to pick up
the new wolf from the station.

35:48.759 --> 35:50.886
One thing at a time.

35:50.971 --> 35:54.641
So, the ancient
wolf's natural prey?

35:54.724 --> 35:56.393
(DUNCAN CLEARS THROAT)

35:56.476 --> 36:00.771
Red deer,
giant deer, megalocerus,

36:01.814 --> 36:07.153
wild horse, wild ox,

36:08.321 --> 36:09.781
wild...

36:10.782 --> 36:12.241
er...

36:14.411 --> 36:15.828
hare.

36:21.251 --> 36:24.087
Well,
that's the hard part done.

36:24.170 --> 36:25.714
Courage, mon brave.

36:25.797 --> 36:27.590
If I had your courage, Molly.

36:27.674 --> 36:30.135
We must both be brave
and count on each other.

36:30.218 --> 36:32.762
This lot'll go down well.

36:32.846 --> 36:36.016
It's rather heart warming
to think that
the poor of Africa

36:36.099 --> 36:38.518
will enjoy the bracing
chafe of the tweed.

36:38.601 --> 36:41.730
-(WHISPERING) It
doesn't work like that.
-We sell them here.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.775
That'll be one of ours,
I dare say.

36:45.859 --> 36:50.447
My dear good woman,
all my attire
comes from Savile Row.

36:50.530 --> 36:53.491
(CHUCKLES) We have
branches everywhere.

36:57.287 --> 37:00.498
Now, you mustn't become
a stranger to Glenbogle.

37:00.582 --> 37:02.542
Nor you to Kilwillie Castle.

37:02.626 --> 37:05.795
As a matter of fact,
I've just added a particularly
delicious vino to my cellar

37:05.879 --> 37:07.922
which would be
sacrilege to drink alone.

37:08.006 --> 37:12.385
-Perhaps you'd join me?
-It's a little early,
even for me.

37:12.469 --> 37:15.138
-This evening?
-I've so much to do.

37:15.221 --> 37:17.724
Well, we could take
a turn in the launch.

37:19.267 --> 37:21.227
Shall we say 6:30?

37:23.563 --> 37:24.689
Good.

37:31.321 --> 37:33.573
The hunter home from the hill.

37:36.034 --> 37:37.410
Where are they?

37:37.494 --> 37:40.163
I'm afraid there were
no rabbits to be had.

37:40.246 --> 37:44.751
Golly, the estate's overrun.
I mean,
they breed like...rabbits.

37:44.834 --> 37:47.128
Nonetheless.

37:47.212 --> 37:49.756
So, how's it all going?

37:49.839 --> 37:52.676
-Wee problem.
-Nimrod has
returned empty-handed.

37:52.759 --> 37:55.887
Well,
maybe the rabbits moved out
when the wolves moved in.

37:55.971 --> 37:58.348
Golly, I know they have
sensitive noses but...

37:58.431 --> 38:01.851
Archie, those wolves create
a terrible strong odour.

38:06.231 --> 38:08.066
Well,
I guess lunch is off, then.

38:08.149 --> 38:10.318
We could have
the competition at dinner.

38:12.112 --> 38:15.657
Fine. It's your turn
to decide the menu, Lex.

38:15.740 --> 38:18.201
Mmm. We are in for
a gastronomic treat.

38:20.120 --> 38:23.707
-Cullen Skink!
-Cullen Skink?

38:23.790 --> 38:26.167
Cullen... Excuse us.

38:27.877 --> 38:30.005
-Come here.
-What?

38:34.342 --> 38:36.094
What?

38:36.177 --> 38:38.805
Of all the things
you choose some
obscure Highland fish stew.

38:38.888 --> 38:42.225
-She's probably
never heard of it.
-It just popped into my head.

38:42.309 --> 38:44.436
You really want
to win, don't you?

38:44.519 --> 38:47.272
I want to marry you
and you'd rather
be my housekeeper.

38:48.773 --> 38:51.318
You're gonna have to
make your mind up, Lex.

38:54.279 --> 38:55.363
(GRUNTS)

39:03.121 --> 39:04.247
Golly.

39:05.415 --> 39:06.458
Golly?

39:08.251 --> 39:09.461
Golly!

39:12.088 --> 39:15.425
I'm just getting
out of your way
now your zoo man's arrived.

39:15.508 --> 39:17.052
You still work here.

39:17.135 --> 39:19.387
Yes, but if he asks me,
I'm gonna have to
give him my opinion

39:19.471 --> 39:21.890
and you don't want
a conscientious
objector on a day like this.

39:21.973 --> 39:24.309
No, I want somebody
who understands animals.

39:24.392 --> 39:26.102
All I know I've learnt
from a book.

39:26.186 --> 39:27.979
This guy's an expert,
he'll see right through me.

39:28.063 --> 39:30.815
I'm sorry, son,
but this was your
decision not mine.

39:30.899 --> 39:34.653
-And you're leaving me to it?
-No, I'm going to do the job
that I was hired to do.

39:34.736 --> 39:36.863
-By my father.
-Oh!

39:36.947 --> 39:39.282
Okay,
Archie, maybe you're right.

39:39.366 --> 39:41.910
Let's just forget what's gone,
get rid of the baggage.

39:41.993 --> 39:44.162
I mean, who cares?

39:44.245 --> 39:46.039
That's not
the way I feel, Golly.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.793
No.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.631
I know you don't.

40:06.226 --> 40:08.645
Don't you want to check
your answers, Mr McKay?

40:08.728 --> 40:12.023
I've got a train to make.
I'm late already!

40:16.111 --> 40:19.030
Duncan, slow down.
Is there a wolf chasing you?

40:19.114 --> 40:22.242
-No, it's worse than that.
-Is Archie giving
you a hard time, too?

40:22.325 --> 40:26.079
No, I've got to go and pick up
the new wolf and Burns is here
for the inspection

40:26.162 --> 40:28.957
and we can't open without him,
and Archie's really worried

40:29.040 --> 40:32.085
and...
And he's depending on me.

40:33.878 --> 40:37.173
-On you?
-Aye, great, isn't it?

40:46.016 --> 40:49.936
Well,
your man's scraped through
the written paper.

40:50.020 --> 40:51.396
Well done, Duncan.

40:51.479 --> 40:55.025
Skin of his teeth,
but he made it.

40:55.108 --> 40:57.944
The important thing is
that he's good
with the animals.

40:58.028 --> 40:59.446
Oh, absolutely.

41:12.417 --> 41:13.918
Here's Duncan now.

41:19.132 --> 41:23.053
-BURNS:
You're going ahead with it?
-Aye. I'm not scared of them.

41:23.136 --> 41:25.889
You put a strange wolf
into the pack now,

41:25.972 --> 41:27.891
they'll probably rip
her to pieces.

41:32.020 --> 41:35.106
They...
They don't attack their own.

41:35.190 --> 41:37.442
Well, you can kiss
your certificate goodbye

41:37.525 --> 41:40.528
until you can find someone
that has the slightest inkling

41:40.612 --> 41:42.405
of what they're doing!

41:46.785 --> 41:48.578
What's the problem?

41:48.662 --> 41:51.247
Burns doesn't want me
to put the new wolf
in with the others.

41:51.331 --> 41:54.626
He has got a point,
the alpha female is pregnant.

41:54.709 --> 41:56.544
Can you not sense it?

41:57.337 --> 41:58.672
BURNS: Who's he?

41:58.755 --> 42:01.091
-That's our gillie.
-Ah.

42:18.608 --> 42:21.194
Easy, girl. Easy.

42:24.864 --> 42:27.367
Easy. Good girl.

42:27.450 --> 42:28.785
Good girl.

42:30.036 --> 42:33.123
Good girl. That's it.

42:49.681 --> 42:52.350
Okay, go, go!

42:54.769 --> 42:55.979
Okay.

42:57.314 --> 43:01.067
Easy, easy.
Good girl, that's it.

43:03.361 --> 43:06.031
No one means you
the slightest harm.

43:06.114 --> 43:08.450
You'll still be
boss of the pack.

43:08.533 --> 43:12.412
Okay, easy, easy.

43:12.495 --> 43:15.624
You show some
respect for your elders,

43:15.707 --> 43:17.834
you might learn something.

43:19.252 --> 43:21.212
Here.

43:21.296 --> 43:25.133
There, that's a girl,
that's a girl. Get the scent.

43:25.216 --> 43:29.512
Good girl,
see, nothing to worry about.

43:29.596 --> 43:32.432
Might come in handy
for the baby-sitting, eh?

43:32.515 --> 43:34.726
Good girl, easy, easy.

43:36.686 --> 43:38.563
Good girl.

43:56.456 --> 43:58.416
BURNS: He's a natural.

43:58.500 --> 44:02.879
Providing he takes the exam,
you've got your head
keeper and your licence.

44:04.464 --> 44:05.590
Well?

44:07.676 --> 44:10.178
Well,
it is not what I'm used to,
Archie,

44:10.261 --> 44:14.557
but if you ask me
to do the job, I'll do it.

44:16.267 --> 44:17.560
Thank you.

44:20.188 --> 44:21.439
Sorry, son.

44:24.067 --> 44:27.654
-I handled it badly, Golly.
-That you did.

44:27.737 --> 44:31.074
Not just you,
I really messed up with Lex.

44:31.157 --> 44:33.285
I don't know how
I could have
been so thoughtless.

44:33.368 --> 44:38.623
You've had a lot to deal with,
but now is the time
to mend some bridges.

44:38.707 --> 44:42.210
-What about Duncan?
-Oh, mightily disappointed.

44:42.294 --> 44:45.297
But he's young,
he can take the knocks.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.674
The older you get,
the harder that becomes.

45:12.991 --> 45:17.287
My granny taught me
how to cook. She taught me
everything I know.

45:17.370 --> 45:22.334
I used to dream of living
in a castle and cooking for
a great family.

45:22.417 --> 45:24.794
Is that still what you want?

45:24.878 --> 45:28.089
-Well, what if it is?
You're here.
-True.

45:28.173 --> 45:30.383
It's a far cry from
the Grand Lothian.

45:30.467 --> 45:34.429
I made a mistake, is
that what you want to hear?

45:34.512 --> 45:38.850
A mistake? And you ended
up here. What did you do,
poison the President?

45:38.933 --> 45:43.229
It wasn't a professional
mistake, and no,
I didn't poison the President.

45:43.313 --> 45:44.648
I won him over actually.

45:45.857 --> 45:48.777
-Not the President?
-He was then.

45:48.860 --> 45:51.947
Bill Clinton spent
a night in the hotel
and I cooked for him.

45:52.030 --> 45:54.616
So, you see, I was
destined to be in the kitchen.

45:55.325 --> 45:57.619
Maybe I am, too.

45:59.537 --> 46:03.291
So,
what did you cook Mr Clinton?

46:03.375 --> 46:07.420
What I'm best known for,
my signature dish if you like.

46:08.755 --> 46:10.173
Cullen Skink.

46:15.720 --> 46:21.351
That was so exhilarating.
The wind and the spray!

46:21.434 --> 46:24.020
Oh, you really
must try it sometime.

46:24.104 --> 46:27.565
"AES Kilwillie,
Eton, 2nd Eleven."

46:27.649 --> 46:29.025
Ah!

46:29.109 --> 46:32.988
Well, I was quite
an all-rounder in those days.

46:33.071 --> 46:36.449
-Delicious.
-You must have another one.

46:36.533 --> 46:38.868
Or, perhaps, something to eat.

46:38.952 --> 46:43.623
Nothing formal,
you understand, just whatever
the kitchen can muster.

46:43.707 --> 46:45.375
I really must get back.

46:45.458 --> 46:48.837
Our new housekeeper
is pitting her skills against
Lexie tonight.

46:48.920 --> 46:52.549
There'll be
tears before bedtime.
Another time perhaps.

46:53.258 --> 46:54.384
Yes.

46:55.510 --> 46:56.970
Another time.

47:10.609 --> 47:14.738
Look, Lexie,
we don't have to do this.

47:15.947 --> 47:17.907
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.620
Irene can work
at the Wildlife Centre,

47:21.703 --> 47:23.663
you can carry on here.
What do you say?

47:26.958 --> 47:28.710
Let battle commence.

47:33.715 --> 47:34.924
Thank you.

47:37.594 --> 47:41.181
Well done, Irene, a new
take on an old favourite.

47:42.724 --> 47:45.727
GOLLY: Yes, it's very nice.

47:45.810 --> 47:49.314
Though haddock
were just that wee
bit bigger in my day.

47:49.397 --> 47:52.943
Never mind. You can
fill up on Lexie's later.
Eh, Lex?

47:53.026 --> 47:55.028
One thing at a time, Duncan.

47:55.111 --> 47:56.905
I'm sorry I'm late,

47:56.988 --> 48:00.367
but Kilwillie absolutely
insisted on dragging me out
on the loch.

48:00.450 --> 48:02.494
And how is Kilwillie?

48:37.737 --> 48:39.864
That was absolutely delicious.

48:39.948 --> 48:41.241
Thank you.

48:41.324 --> 48:44.536
Don't worry, left
plenty room for yours, Lex.

48:44.619 --> 48:46.288
So you've really done it.

48:47.580 --> 48:49.291
You've made your choice?

48:50.792 --> 48:52.085
Yeah.

49:01.886 --> 49:03.805
No more doubts.

49:03.888 --> 49:05.890
No more cooking?

49:05.974 --> 49:11.438
Why would I want to be
in the kitchen when I could
be here at my own table,

49:12.856 --> 49:14.607
with my own man?

49:23.199 --> 49:25.785
So that's a no to
the Cullen Skink, then?

49:27.370 --> 49:30.206
I still can't
believe you got engaged
with a ring pull.

49:30.290 --> 49:32.792
Well, it's all we
could find at the time.

49:36.504 --> 49:40.884
-The new wolf seems
to have fitted in fine.
-Well enough.

49:40.967 --> 49:45.889
I think it's great
this Wildlife Centre idea.
Makes life more interesting.

49:45.972 --> 49:49.017
Och, well, you're young.

49:49.100 --> 49:52.646
You're not old,
Golly, you're experienced.

49:53.813 --> 49:57.484
-Some women like that.
-For example?

49:58.360 --> 50:00.111
No one in particular.

50:00.195 --> 50:02.572
You can put all such ideas
right out of
your head, Duncan.

50:02.656 --> 50:06.326
She's a looker,
and sophisticated.

50:06.409 --> 50:09.371
I've no mind to
go courting Irene.

50:09.454 --> 50:13.249
Aye, like you'd no
mind to be head keeper,

50:14.000 --> 50:15.585
but here you are.

50:22.842 --> 50:28.890
What do you think, Lexie?
This yellow for
the golden sands of the Sahara

50:28.974 --> 50:31.309
or the blue of
the African sky?

50:32.477 --> 50:36.815
Yellow.
Yellow's more cheerful.

50:36.898 --> 50:38.566
Then yellow it is.

50:40.694 --> 50:42.696
Em...

50:42.779 --> 50:45.824
I've been
thinking about my room.

50:45.907 --> 50:48.285
Redecorating?

50:48.368 --> 50:52.414
Moving out and
moving into Archie's room.

50:52.497 --> 50:55.375
-May I ask...
-If you don't approve,
it's fine.

50:55.458 --> 50:58.253
May I ask what has
taken you so long, Lexie?

50:58.336 --> 51:02.549
Love is precious,
every single moment of it,
don't waste it.

51:02.632 --> 51:05.802
You're not young forever,
even if you're
in love forever.

51:08.596 --> 51:11.725
Are you? In love forever?

51:14.394 --> 51:18.982
Now, when Archie
drives you mad, which he will
from time to time,

51:19.065 --> 51:23.653
you can move into
Hector's old room.
I'm going to decorate it next.

51:23.737 --> 51:28.575
Something very warm
and very colourful,
don't you think?

51:48.720 --> 51:50.764
What's this?

51:50.847 --> 51:55.435
Archie Macdonald,
will you take this
former brainless idiot

51:55.518 --> 51:57.604
to be your lawful wedded wife?

52:01.775 --> 52:03.109
Yes.

52:06.279 --> 52:10.200
But there is one condition.

52:10.659 --> 52:11.910
Oh, yes?

52:14.120 --> 52:18.583
Do you think
that we might
improve on a ring pull?

52:18.667 --> 52:21.795
You stingy,
Scottish cheapskate.

52:21.878 --> 52:24.464
That's nothing to
what my mother called me.

52:30.637 --> 52:34.474
-But that's Molly's.
-She wanted you to have it.

52:45.485 --> 52:48.154
So, we do get our
fairy-tale ending?

53:05.547 --> 53:07.590
(GIGGLING)

53:09.926 --> 53:12.595
Good night, Mr Laird.

53:12.679 --> 53:14.431
Good night, Mrs Laird.
