WEBVTT

00:00.273 --> 00:02.116
Previously on "Bitten"...

00:02.141 --> 00:03.340
None of this will stop

00:03.342 --> 00:04.675
as long as Roman is still alive.

00:04.677 --> 00:06.177
You don't have to go after him alone.

00:06.179 --> 00:07.678
It's incredible,

00:07.680 --> 00:09.880
a natural-born witch comes
to her power at puberty.

00:09.882 --> 00:11.682
- You have it now.
- He's here.

00:11.684 --> 00:13.750
- What? Who's here?
- The one who killed mom,

00:13.883 --> 00:15.082
the red-eyed wolf.

00:16.753 --> 00:18.286
What in God's name did you do?

00:20.290 --> 00:22.290
This is my list.

00:22.292 --> 00:24.091
You are on it.

00:24.093 --> 00:26.760
Paige mentioned that Roman
is hunting Russian witches.

00:26.762 --> 00:29.475
That he can't find out
what's happening to Rocco.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.667
I won't let Roman anywhere near Rocco.

00:31.669 --> 00:33.669
All this goes away if we stop Roman.

00:33.671 --> 00:35.136
How are you going to do that?

00:35.138 --> 00:37.005
I can bring him
something that he wants.

00:37.007 --> 00:39.340
And once I'm close, I'll kill him.

00:39.342 --> 00:40.842
Nick!

00:40.844 --> 00:43.678
Where is she? Where's the girl?

00:47.017 --> 00:48.516
We're going to
get him back, Rachel.

00:48.518 --> 00:50.318
This is the way.

00:50.320 --> 00:54.354
When was the last time
that Rocco wore this?

00:54.356 --> 00:55.851
Yesterday.

00:56.016 --> 00:57.348
Good.

01:02.322 --> 01:05.123
Now, put your hand over the map,

01:05.125 --> 01:08.626
and the marble will tell
us where we need to go.

01:15.502 --> 01:17.101
Now close your eyes.

01:19.506 --> 01:23.641
Unire per amorem.

01:24.511 --> 01:27.645
Unire per amorem.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.247
Again.

01:30.249 --> 01:34.184
Unire per amorem.

01:34.186 --> 01:37.154
Unire per amorem.

01:37.156 --> 01:38.989
It's not working.

01:42.528 --> 01:45.062
Maybe you need a breather.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.696
That's not what I need!

01:46.698 --> 01:48.532
My baby is gone somewhere

01:48.534 --> 01:51.000
because of that girl
that you brought here.

01:51.002 --> 01:53.203
If this is how we find him,
then let's just do it.

01:53.205 --> 01:55.004
Rachel, you cannot force it.

01:55.006 --> 01:57.674
- You just need to...
- Don't tell me to calm down.

02:01.345 --> 02:03.713
You know, Rachel, the first
time that I saw Rocco,

02:03.715 --> 02:05.882
I thought about Logan.

02:05.884 --> 02:09.217
It's that little smile he has,

02:09.220 --> 02:11.754
looks so much like his dad.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.089
Just...

02:13.091 --> 02:15.724
think about that smile.

02:15.726 --> 02:17.926
Think about how good it's going to feel

02:17.928 --> 02:19.928
to hold him again.

02:19.930 --> 02:21.397
Rachel.

02:21.399 --> 02:24.166
To make him smile again.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074

02:35.112 --> 02:36.444
Hey.

02:39.249 --> 02:40.882
You can do this.

02:46.957 --> 02:50.891
Unire per amorem.

02:52.429 --> 02:56.063
Unire per amorem.

02:57.434 --> 03:00.602
Unire per...

03:00.604 --> 03:01.936
amorem.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.941
Unire per amorem.

03:08.444 --> 03:09.944
So much for that!

03:19.989 --> 03:21.988
Rachel. Rachel!

03:21.990 --> 03:23.123
Rachel!

03:26.995 --> 03:28.495
You okay?

03:28.497 --> 03:30.464
- I saw him.
- What?

03:30.466 --> 03:33.467
I saw his smile.

03:33.469 --> 03:36.637
He was right in front of me.

03:36.639 --> 03:38.104
He's there.

03:39.474 --> 03:41.107
I know it.

03:42.978 --> 03:44.944
Let's go get your son, then.

04:17.851 --> 04:21.070
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:40.031 --> 04:42.031
Yes...

04:42.033 --> 04:44.166
There's nothing I can do with these.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.870
Perhaps you'd like to try
that entrance again.

04:50.078 --> 04:52.067
And tell me something I'd like to hear.

04:52.068 --> 04:53.768
It would be a lie.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.969
In Russia, we have connections
to get printing supplies,

04:55.971 --> 04:57.505
but here we do not.

04:59.909 --> 05:01.241
We will not leave here

05:01.243 --> 05:04.244
until Sasha Antonov is dead.

05:04.246 --> 05:06.881
The district leaders are restless.

05:07.917 --> 05:09.116
We have no money to pay them,

05:09.118 --> 05:10.618
and the longer we stay here here,

05:10.620 --> 05:12.752
the longer we risk losing
control of our Pack.

05:15.925 --> 05:18.591
You think I'm losing control?

05:18.593 --> 05:19.793
No.

05:19.795 --> 05:21.929
So, what will we do?

05:23.265 --> 05:26.599
Stay here until Sasha Antonov
is delivered to you.

05:26.601 --> 05:28.601
Da.

05:28.603 --> 05:29.936
Where would she be?

05:29.938 --> 05:31.571
Some place that attracts tourists.

05:31.573 --> 05:33.272
She knows it's easier to blend in

05:33.274 --> 05:35.107
at a place where there
are always strangers.

05:35.109 --> 05:37.276
Is there a way we can track her?
Credit card?

05:37.278 --> 05:39.111
No. We do everything in cash.

05:39.113 --> 05:40.413
How much does she have?

05:40.415 --> 05:42.615
What was left in her stash, Alexei?

05:42.617 --> 05:44.283
2,000, maybe.

05:44.285 --> 05:45.784
That's enough to last a while.

05:45.786 --> 05:47.786
Get her clear across the country.

05:47.788 --> 05:49.455
What about her cell phone?

05:49.457 --> 05:51.657
She's turned off the phone's
tracking abilities.

05:51.659 --> 05:53.326
So, unless she contacts us...

05:56.630 --> 05:57.964
Have you talked to her?

05:59.334 --> 06:01.633
Do you know where she's
gone, what she's up to?

06:01.635 --> 06:03.635
No, no, I have no idea.

06:03.637 --> 06:04.970
Give me your phone.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.473
Now!

06:09.977 --> 06:11.477
If we knew why she took Rocco,

06:11.479 --> 06:13.479
then we could anticipate
where she's going.

06:13.481 --> 06:16.147
She has never, never
done anything like this.

06:16.149 --> 06:18.316
No, he hasn't talked to her.

06:18.318 --> 06:19.851
Yeah, that's what I said.

06:21.621 --> 06:24.089
Look, maybe she took the
baby to protect him.

06:24.091 --> 06:25.656
To protect him?

06:25.658 --> 06:27.492
I warned her
about the red-eyed wolf.

06:27.494 --> 06:29.194
Maybe she thought that taking the baby

06:29.196 --> 06:31.062
was the only way to
make sure he was safe.

06:31.064 --> 06:33.164
That wolf slaughtered their mother.

06:33.166 --> 06:35.533
She would be terrified
if she knew he was here.

06:35.535 --> 06:37.468
I know it sounds crazy,

06:37.470 --> 06:39.804
but what other reason could she have?

06:39.806 --> 06:41.472
Nick's heading northeast.

06:41.474 --> 06:43.841
Tell him to focus on tourist
spots where she can blend in.

06:43.843 --> 06:46.143
No, I will find her.

06:49.482 --> 06:51.681
Okay, you two go and meet up with Nick,

06:51.683 --> 06:53.317
track Katia as a team.

06:54.686 --> 06:56.020
Come on.

07:05.031 --> 07:06.222
Hello?

07:06.247 --> 07:07.846
Clayton Danvers?

07:10.035 --> 07:11.515
Who is this?

07:11.541 --> 07:14.743
I'm at Reg's Tavern.
You know Reg's Tavern?

07:15.874 --> 07:17.507
Reg isn't here anymore.

07:21.713 --> 07:23.713
It's him.

07:23.715 --> 07:25.515
I'm going to take him out.

07:27.385 --> 07:29.885
We need to find out
what he's up to, first.

07:29.887 --> 07:32.055
Take Jorge with you.

07:32.057 --> 07:34.657
Be careful. Okay?

07:35.893 --> 07:37.226
Hey.

07:38.396 --> 07:40.796
Aren't you forgetting something?

07:51.442 --> 07:52.575
I love you.

07:54.912 --> 07:57.079
I'm counting on it.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.566
You're okay.

08:19.636 --> 08:21.135
You're okay.

08:22.338 --> 08:26.107
Oh, you're okay. Shhh.

08:26.109 --> 08:28.943
Oh, look at the dolly!

08:28.945 --> 08:30.144
You like the dolly?

08:30.146 --> 08:33.647
See? Hi! Hi!

08:33.649 --> 08:35.116
Oh!

08:35.118 --> 08:36.783
Shhh.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.119
You're okay.

08:38.988 --> 08:40.953
You're okay.

08:47.496 --> 08:48.762
Where are you?

08:48.764 --> 08:50.463
Did
you get the number?

08:50.465 --> 08:51.865
Off Jeremy's computer, yeah,

08:51.867 --> 08:54.134
but Katia, we're all coming after you.

08:54.136 --> 08:55.468
Dad's pissed.

08:55.470 --> 08:57.303
He won't be after I fix everything.

08:57.305 --> 08:59.106
Give me the number.

08:59.108 --> 09:00.807
Is that the baby?

09:00.809 --> 09:02.175
Yeah, he's fine.

09:02.177 --> 09:03.676
It's just, he's just a little cranky.

09:03.678 --> 09:05.445
Look, if Dad finds out
I helped you do this,

09:05.447 --> 09:06.979
he's going to lose it.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.681
Look, I'll make sure nothing
happens to the baby.

09:08.683 --> 09:11.017
But this is the only way. Please?

09:11.986 --> 09:13.319
Alexei!

09:15.490 --> 09:17.023
Who are you talking to?

09:17.025 --> 09:18.525
Katia, we're all worried.

09:18.527 --> 09:19.659
Call me back.

09:21.162 --> 09:22.494
Leaving Katia a message.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.630
She's, uh, still not answering.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.133
I'm starting the truck. Let's go.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.474
Alexei!

09:45.819 --> 09:49.020
Two cars out back, couple of
customers and a bartender inside.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.022
He's waiting for me.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.524
Just doesn't make any sense, though,

09:52.526 --> 09:54.225
one minute he's trying to kill you,

09:54.227 --> 09:55.560
the next, what...

09:55.562 --> 09:58.362
guy wants to have a beer
and a crossword party?

09:58.364 --> 10:00.665
- Get behind the wheel.
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.201
- You're not going in there.
- What else should I do?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.003
We sit here, we wait
for him to come out,

10:05.005 --> 10:08.006
we stuff him into a bag and we
throw him off the Taylor Bridge.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.208
Ah, it's not going to be
that easy with this guy.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.743
Why? Worked for Rasputin.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.745
Actually, it didn't.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.080
That's true.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.598
I wasn't sure you would come.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.103
The house is empty.

10:40.405 --> 10:42.106
It's just you and me.

10:54.622 --> 10:57.956
You fight to defend your Pack
as though they are your family.

10:59.327 --> 11:00.826
They are.

11:00.828 --> 11:04.329
And now, your world has blown open.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.131
Antonovs, and Navikevs.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.466
Families fight and they make peace.

11:08.468 --> 11:12.337
I'm hoping that we can find a
way to solve our problems,

11:12.339 --> 11:13.672
together.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.677
I need you to call off your assassin.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.212
The wolf with the red eye.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.847
The Albino.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.849
He has our names in his book.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.852
The Antonovs, myself included.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.387
It's his kill list.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.322
That is how he operates.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.723
There's nothing I can do.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.158
My father is the only one
who can ask him to stop.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.860
And if you ordered him to do it?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.663
Roman's wolves are loyal to Roman.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.034
Your father's wolves are
loyal to his money.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.036
The Albino's not on the payroll,

11:45.038 --> 11:48.039
he does what he does out
of personal interest.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.507
But for the rest, it
is true, and it works.

11:50.509 --> 11:54.678
I have created a finely tuned
system to manage such a large Pack.

11:54.680 --> 11:58.248
I do not want to lose that, so I am
willing to make a deal with you.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.250
What kind of deal?

12:00.252 --> 12:02.186
Sasha Antonov.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.389
If Roman has Sasha, the feud will end.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.190
And so will the list.

12:23.074 --> 12:25.208
Hey man, what can I get you?

12:25.210 --> 12:28.744
Brian, give him a beer on the house.

12:28.746 --> 12:30.079
You got it, boss.

12:37.555 --> 12:40.089
Don't know how this dude
plans on making money.

12:40.091 --> 12:41.924
It's been on the house all day.

12:41.926 --> 12:45.427
- You work for that guy?
- He owns the place,

12:45.429 --> 12:48.597
- so yeah.
- Is anyone else here?

12:48.599 --> 12:49.932
Just what you see.

12:51.135 --> 12:52.267
Thanks.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.314
You can sit, Clayton Danvers.

13:06.316 --> 13:08.916
Ah, you see? Sudoku.

13:10.254 --> 13:12.453
I like to fill in boxes.
Very... very good.

13:12.455 --> 13:14.455
Very relaxing.

13:14.457 --> 13:15.790
Go, please, sit.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.259
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

13:18.261 --> 13:20.594
I like that you come. It means
I know how you are thinking.

13:20.596 --> 13:22.630
I'm thinking this isn't
going to end well for you.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.932
Me? Meh... what about Brian?

13:29.338 --> 13:31.004
What about him?

13:31.006 --> 13:32.640
Do what you are thinking. Break
the bottle on the table.

13:32.642 --> 13:34.642
Use the sharp end, here, kill me.

13:34.644 --> 13:36.277
Blood all over, big mess.

13:36.279 --> 13:38.445
Then, what you do about Brian?

13:38.447 --> 13:40.648
What you do about some
other stupid American

13:40.650 --> 13:42.483
who comes in looking for free beer?

13:42.485 --> 13:44.818
Then police come. You see?

13:44.820 --> 13:46.219
It's a big mess.

14:02.204 --> 14:04.970
Ah, so we talk.

14:06.675 --> 14:10.042
So we're here, which is...

14:10.044 --> 14:11.377
nowhere.

14:11.379 --> 14:12.845
So what do we do?

14:12.847 --> 14:14.681
This is new territory for me, Nick.

14:14.683 --> 14:16.482
I don't know. Maybe we got it wrong.

14:16.484 --> 14:18.851
Well, we're in between
these three towns.

14:18.853 --> 14:21.020
We could go to each one and ask around.

14:21.022 --> 14:22.855
That'll take too long.

14:22.857 --> 14:26.192
We're close. I know it, I can feel it.

14:26.194 --> 14:28.861
- Look, I believe you....
- Let's try the spell again.

14:28.863 --> 14:30.696
- It's hurting you...
- I don't care.

14:30.698 --> 14:33.065
I got us this far, I can get us closer.

14:35.336 --> 14:38.002
Unire per amorem.

14:39.707 --> 14:41.940
Unire per amorem.

14:45.879 --> 14:48.847
Unire per amorem.

14:59.425 --> 15:00.514
...we've got to stop it!

15:00.539 --> 15:01.059
Wait, wait.

15:01.061 --> 15:02.560
Something is wrong,

15:02.562 --> 15:04.062
the energy isn't coming
from inside the circle.

15:04.064 --> 15:05.563
This is crazy.

15:12.071 --> 15:15.740
Shh, it's okay.

15:15.742 --> 15:18.276
What do you need?

15:19.912 --> 15:21.912
Is it too bright?

15:21.914 --> 15:23.748
It's too bright?

15:23.750 --> 15:25.082
Okay.

15:26.285 --> 15:28.451
Okay.

15:28.453 --> 15:30.754
That's better.

15:30.756 --> 15:33.223
Yeah, you're tired.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.061
Shhh.

15:46.938 --> 15:49.539
...per amorem.

16:21.972 --> 16:23.972
- What happened?
- I don't know.

16:23.974 --> 16:25.307
I felt him.

16:25.309 --> 16:27.443
I could... I could see things.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.812
- What did you see?
- A ship's wheel on a wall.

16:30.814 --> 16:33.148
A lighthouse.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.317
And then it... just stopped.

16:35.319 --> 16:38.186
A lighthouse, all right, she
was pointing towards Olcott.

16:38.188 --> 16:39.587
Okay, I can work with that.

16:39.589 --> 16:41.789
- Why did it stop?
- The connection was lost.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.791
That could've be anything.
He's all right.

16:43.793 --> 16:47.294
I felt him, I would know if
anything happened to him.

17:11.487 --> 17:13.854
Hmm?

17:13.856 --> 17:15.256
Roman Navikev?

17:15.258 --> 17:16.257
Yes.

17:16.259 --> 17:17.691
I am Katia Antonov.

17:17.693 --> 17:19.693
I have something you want.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.027
How did you get this number?

17:21.029 --> 17:22.596
Did you get my video?

17:22.598 --> 17:25.365
I know you've been seeking
out witches in Russia.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.034
Who told you this?

17:28.036 --> 17:31.371
The witch who discovered
this baby has powers.

17:31.373 --> 17:33.373
The video shows you what he can do.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.376
He's a werewolf baby
who is also a witch.

17:36.378 --> 17:39.879
He's the only one.

17:39.881 --> 17:41.514
You can have him,

17:41.516 --> 17:44.517
in exchange for my family's freedom.

17:44.519 --> 17:46.886
I want you to lift the blood feud.

17:46.888 --> 17:50.056
Call off your red-eyed wolf.

17:50.058 --> 17:53.225
Where are you? I will come to you.

17:53.227 --> 17:55.093
No, that's not how
this is going to work.

17:55.095 --> 17:58.697
- We'll meet in the town of Olcott.
- Olcott.

17:58.699 --> 18:02.668
At the fountain at the
corner of Main and Franklin.

18:03.905 --> 18:05.938
I will be there in two hours.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.306
Come alone.

18:07.308 --> 18:09.741
If I see anyone else, I disappear.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.417
Hotels in Olcott, New York.

18:18.419 --> 18:21.053
Send two men to each one of them.

18:37.437 --> 18:39.771
You're not going anywhere.

18:39.773 --> 18:42.239
Roman Navikev is.

18:58.289 --> 19:00.038
I'm curious about you.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.205
We are the same, you and me.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.208
- We're not the same.
- We are both the best, I see this.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.544
Nobody gets away from me, but you did.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.045
You were the one running away.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.882
This is true. You surprise me.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.050
Usually, it's very easy,
it's very boring.

19:14.052 --> 19:16.887
But you... you are not boring.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.889
You're a killer. Like me.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.590
Keep your voice down.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.195
- Brian!
- Uh?

19:28.367 --> 19:31.434
You like the movies with werewolves?

19:31.436 --> 19:32.635
What's that?

19:32.637 --> 19:35.571
You know, werewolves, grrr!

19:35.573 --> 19:37.072
Not really.

19:37.074 --> 19:38.741
My girl likes that stuff.

19:38.743 --> 19:40.075
This isn't funny.

19:41.245 --> 19:43.913
Have a beer, Brian, on the house.

19:43.915 --> 19:46.715
Really? Cool.

19:46.717 --> 19:49.551
- You're crazy.
- Bah, "crazy", what does this mean?

19:49.553 --> 19:51.887
You'd risk everything
just to have your fun.

19:51.889 --> 19:54.390
Breathing is risk. Walking
down the street is risk.

19:54.392 --> 19:56.258
Life is risk. This is not crazy.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.727
Roman should have had you
killed, you'll expose us all.

19:58.729 --> 20:01.930
No. I could tell Brian everything.
Show him everything.

20:01.932 --> 20:03.932
Then I kill him before
he gets to the door.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.934
He's a stupid human,
means nothing to me.

20:05.936 --> 20:07.268
But you...

20:08.472 --> 20:09.771
you care.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.272
This is why I'm curious.

20:11.274 --> 20:13.475
I know you've killed many, many wolves.

20:13.477 --> 20:15.076
I know they fear you.

20:16.947 --> 20:19.113
You've tasted the power.

20:19.115 --> 20:21.249
How can you not want more?

20:23.119 --> 20:25.253
What is it you care about so much?

20:54.616 --> 20:56.984
I know your weakness, this is good.

20:56.986 --> 21:00.120
I feed on weakness, makes me stronger.

21:01.823 --> 21:04.458
You can hide in here all you want.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.627
Out there, I will be waiting for
you and I won't be playing games.

21:07.629 --> 21:11.130
That's too bad, for some
of us, games are fun.

21:14.836 --> 21:17.236
Clayton.

21:17.238 --> 21:18.371
The girl.

21:19.641 --> 21:23.142
Say your goodbyes to her
before it is too late.

21:34.188 --> 21:36.188
It is simple, really.

21:36.190 --> 21:39.025
You give me your father.
His children go free.

21:39.027 --> 21:40.493
That includes you.

21:40.495 --> 21:43.361
What makes you think that
I'm going to do that?

21:43.363 --> 21:45.864
Neither of us want to go to war.

21:45.866 --> 21:48.199
The Russian Pack has the numbers,

21:48.201 --> 21:50.201
but when opposing forces
try to attack you,

21:50.203 --> 21:53.705
they end up in piles of dead bodies.

21:53.707 --> 21:55.206
Yes, that's true.

21:55.208 --> 21:57.509
The problem with going
to war, my dear niece,

21:57.511 --> 21:59.844
is that you and I will both lose.

21:59.846 --> 22:02.047
You do not like to lose
people you care about.

22:02.049 --> 22:03.681
I do not like to lose control.

22:03.683 --> 22:06.884
But I will lose someone I care
about if I give you Sasha.

22:06.985 --> 22:08.485
What is he to you? You care.

22:08.597 --> 22:10.388
Why, because he's your father?

22:10.671 --> 22:12.504
Because you want his approval?

22:12.542 --> 22:15.059
Because you want him to
say you are special?

22:15.061 --> 22:17.194
The child he loves the most?

22:21.400 --> 22:24.234
No. We have bigger problems.

22:24.236 --> 22:25.436
We must clean our houses.

22:25.438 --> 22:27.605
To do that, you give us Sasha Antonov.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.940
We go away.

22:30.742 --> 22:33.444
Our house is clean.

22:35.281 --> 22:37.548
Really?

22:37.550 --> 22:39.550
This morning I received a news alert

22:39.552 --> 22:42.419
about what I assume was
werewolf activity.

22:42.421 --> 22:46.423
A missing camper, killed by
a wolf outside of Syracuse.

22:46.425 --> 22:48.558
It's been taken care of.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.560
A small mess compared
to what your father did

22:50.562 --> 22:52.261
when he stabbed an innocent human.

22:52.263 --> 22:54.564
We can go back and
forth, my deal remains.

22:54.566 --> 22:57.400
I need your father so mine will go home.

23:00.939 --> 23:02.906
That wound on your neck is fresh.

23:02.908 --> 23:06.075
Far too fresh for it to be
something that I did to you.

23:08.079 --> 23:11.581
Is this the part where you
try to psychoanalyze me?

23:11.583 --> 23:14.950
You've spent your whole life helping
your father build his Pack.

23:17.755 --> 23:21.456
Even now, you come here to negotiate.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.959
You didn't know if this was an ambush.

23:23.961 --> 23:25.961
You care,

23:25.963 --> 23:28.263
not about him, but about your Pack.

23:32.970 --> 23:35.104
And you let him walk all over you.

23:36.607 --> 23:39.774
We're doing the same thing, you and I.

23:39.776 --> 23:44.979
Defending our fathers for the
greater good of our Packs.

23:44.981 --> 23:47.149
Except your father doesn't care

23:47.151 --> 23:49.584
if you live or die.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.293
Anything from Katia?

24:02.398 --> 24:03.531
Nothing.

24:03.533 --> 24:05.800
Look, she's not going to hurt the baby.

24:05.802 --> 24:08.502
I don't understand why
she would take him.

24:08.504 --> 24:10.337
You weren't there, you wouldn't know.

24:10.339 --> 24:14.007
- Where?
- When that monster killed our mother.

24:14.009 --> 24:15.976
The red-eyed wolf.

24:15.978 --> 24:19.346
- But what she is doing, how...
- You weren't there, all right?

24:19.348 --> 24:21.182
She's just trying to
protect us from him.

24:21.184 --> 24:23.817
Protect us? What do you mean?

24:23.819 --> 24:27.721
How is taking the baby
protecting us from him?

24:31.026 --> 24:32.358
Alexei?

24:33.361 --> 24:35.162
Tell me, what is she doing?

24:35.164 --> 24:36.730
Tell me!

24:36.732 --> 24:38.665
- She's using the baby to lure Roman.
- What?

24:38.667 --> 24:41.668
- She's going to kill him.
- Oh my God.

24:41.670 --> 24:43.836
He'll slaughter her. Where is she?

24:43.838 --> 24:46.038
- I don't know.
- Where is she, damn it!

24:46.040 --> 24:47.373
- I don't know, I swear.
- Tell me!

24:47.375 --> 24:49.041
If you don't, your sister is dead.

24:49.043 --> 24:50.376
I swear I don't know!

24:50.378 --> 24:52.044
Just a motel, I think.

24:52.046 --> 24:55.548
She's not responding to calls or text.

25:02.556 --> 25:03.856
What did he say?

25:03.858 --> 25:06.759
He knows we won't do
anything with humans around.

25:06.761 --> 25:07.960
That's it?

25:07.962 --> 25:09.394
He's a liability to all of us,

25:09.396 --> 25:12.198
he needs to be put down
before he kills anyone else.

25:15.236 --> 25:16.835
More bodies to bury.

25:20.073 --> 25:22.040
- What's this?
- The coordinates

25:22.042 --> 25:24.243
for where I laid Karen
Morgan's body to rest.

25:24.245 --> 25:26.245
For Jeremy.

25:26.247 --> 25:27.879
He wants to visit her grave.

25:27.881 --> 25:31.082
Jeremy appreciates everything
you do to protect us.

25:31.084 --> 25:33.051
We all do.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.620
I don't think we hide
to protect ourselves,

25:35.622 --> 25:36.621
but...

25:36.623 --> 25:39.791
to protect the world from us.

25:39.793 --> 25:41.425
Guys like him.

25:41.427 --> 25:43.427
We do what we have to.

25:43.429 --> 25:44.829
We'll get through it, Jorge.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.467
It's getting hard, you know?

25:49.469 --> 25:50.601
What is?

25:52.272 --> 25:55.205
That was the first time
I had to bury a woman.

25:58.745 --> 26:00.578
It's like we're failing.

26:52.997 --> 26:54.330
Ugh!

26:59.059 --> 27:00.488
The last time we were together,

27:00.513 --> 27:02.910
your father was more
focused on killing Sasha

27:03.363 --> 27:04.873
than protecting you.

27:05.278 --> 27:07.945
He knew I could take care of myself.

27:07.947 --> 27:10.247
And I'm not sentimental about him.

27:10.249 --> 27:14.118
And I'm not sentimental about a
grandfather who wants to kill me.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.588
Both of these men are Roman Navikev.

27:17.590 --> 27:20.256
We have more in common than just blood.

27:22.911 --> 27:25.711
You think my father is the
root of all problems.

27:27.028 --> 27:28.828
I am not offended.

27:28.830 --> 27:32.698
There is no need to
psychoanalyze me when I...

27:32.700 --> 27:34.833
wear my heart on my sleeve.

27:36.203 --> 27:37.836
Because of my hard work, my dedication,

27:37.838 --> 27:39.538
my father has a loyal Pack.

27:39.540 --> 27:42.173
Does he thank me for that? No.

27:42.175 --> 27:44.309
The second your father
appears out of nowhere,

27:44.311 --> 27:46.545
he runs after him like a mad wolf.

27:48.048 --> 27:49.380
Why?

27:50.583 --> 27:53.918
Because Antonov stole my sister's heart.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.055
My father loved her from afar,

27:57.057 --> 27:58.857
he could never know her.

28:01.194 --> 28:06.230
Do you know what it's like, to
grow up in the shadow of a human?

28:06.232 --> 28:08.399
- I was a human.
- No,

28:08.401 --> 28:10.868
you were the perfect storm.

28:10.870 --> 28:14.071
Werewolf blood from both parents.

28:14.073 --> 28:15.740
You were always one of us,

28:15.742 --> 28:18.409
even before you knew we existed.

28:18.411 --> 28:19.744
And you're my uncle.

28:22.248 --> 28:24.014
Together we can fix this.

28:26.252 --> 28:28.585
How?

28:28.587 --> 28:32.022
It's not my father that needs to die.

29:17.468 --> 29:19.134
Get away from my son.

29:19.136 --> 29:21.102
Rachel, I'm sorry.

29:21.104 --> 29:22.410
He's okay, I didn't...

29:22.435 --> 29:25.140
You need to step away from me right now.

29:32.316 --> 29:33.949
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:33.951 --> 29:35.616
What the hell were you thinking?

29:37.020 --> 29:38.286
I'm sorry.

29:45.962 --> 29:49.129
Hey, will you help me with this?
Come on.

29:53.503 --> 29:55.302
I think that's
it for the bodies.

29:55.304 --> 29:57.839
Go back to the room, help Nick, make
sure we haven't missed anything.

29:57.841 --> 29:59.340
- What are you going to do?
- Go!

29:59.342 --> 30:01.641
Roman may have more men coming, go on!

30:03.346 --> 30:05.145
How could you do this?

30:05.147 --> 30:07.848
After all Elena and her
Pack have done to help us.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.850
I was never going to give up Rocco.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.852
I just needed to get close to Roman.

30:11.854 --> 30:14.154
I did not raise you to behave this way.

30:14.156 --> 30:17.324
Yeah, let's look at how we were raised.
Our mother was murdered.

30:17.326 --> 30:20.326
Alexei and I live in terror that
the same thing will happen to us.

30:20.328 --> 30:23.697
I thought I had to steal an
innocent baby to stay alive...

30:23.699 --> 30:25.699
And I know how terrible that is.

30:25.701 --> 30:27.701
But I thought it was our best option.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.870
I was doing what I had to, to save us.

30:29.872 --> 30:31.671
Something you haven't done.

30:33.074 --> 30:34.273
I want you to get in.

30:34.275 --> 30:35.875
I'm going to take you back to Stonehaven

30:35.877 --> 30:37.410
once I've dealt with your mess.

30:37.412 --> 30:38.878
You know what? I'm done with you!

30:38.880 --> 30:40.679
I'm going back with Nick.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.033
We're good.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.576
Hey, uh, just take this,

31:11.578 --> 31:13.045
give us a sec.

31:16.050 --> 31:18.250
Everything's all cleaned up.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.584
We should get going.

31:21.055 --> 31:24.923
Everything's all cleaned up. Great.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.391
Look, I'm very sorry for
what happened to you today.

31:27.393 --> 31:30.261
I'm part of this world, Rocco
is part of this world,

31:30.263 --> 31:32.063
I get that.

31:32.065 --> 31:35.767
But it doesn't mean that I
don't get to have choices.

31:35.769 --> 31:38.069
That I don't have control.

31:38.071 --> 31:41.805
I appreciate all that
you've done for me, Nick.

31:41.807 --> 31:43.941
Really.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.444
But you need to tell Jeremy...

31:46.446 --> 31:48.612
He doesn't get to decide for me.

31:48.614 --> 31:50.948
He doesn't get to decide where I live,

31:50.950 --> 31:54.085
what I can do, or what
happens to my son.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.621
Okay.

31:59.792 --> 32:03.293
Paige is going to help me
figure out how to control...

32:03.295 --> 32:06.096
whatever this is that I have.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.298
Because I'm done waiting for all of you

32:08.300 --> 32:10.767
to tell me what my future is.

32:29.020 --> 32:30.285
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:37.829 --> 32:40.997
Taking Katia back to Stonehaven?

32:40.999 --> 32:43.633
Looks like I don't have a choice.

32:45.136 --> 32:46.835
Thank you for everything.

32:46.837 --> 32:49.271
- It means a lot.
- Of course.

32:51.142 --> 32:52.341
So, what now?

32:52.343 --> 32:54.643
Rachel needs training, so
I'll give that to her.

32:54.645 --> 32:57.679
How long it takes and what's
involved, I don't know.

32:57.681 --> 32:59.148
But she needs you too.

33:00.351 --> 33:02.317
Nick, you're her family.

33:02.319 --> 33:05.854
Just doing my job, you know?

33:05.856 --> 33:09.024
When she needed you, you were there.

33:09.026 --> 33:10.525
You helped her, you calmed her down.

33:10.527 --> 33:11.860
You have a connection.

33:11.862 --> 33:15.697
Familiarity, family, whatever.

33:15.699 --> 33:17.032
It's real.

33:19.536 --> 33:20.868
Yeah.

33:20.870 --> 33:22.836
Come on, give me a hug.

34:03.945 --> 34:05.078
So...

34:06.582 --> 34:09.916
You think it is Roman that needs to die.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.918
I cannot kill him,

34:11.920 --> 34:13.385
but I will not stand in your way.

34:15.223 --> 34:19.759
He will not leave until the
Albino finishes his tasks.

34:19.761 --> 34:21.928
And the house is fortified.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.262
How would you even get close?

34:27.768 --> 34:29.101
Leave it to me.

34:30.438 --> 34:31.770
I'll let you know.

34:39.447 --> 34:41.947
How soon?

34:41.949 --> 34:43.915
As soon as you can get back.

34:45.452 --> 34:46.784
And the Albino?

34:48.255 --> 34:50.755
I'll call him off once
my father is dead.

34:50.757 --> 34:53.759
Do you really think you're
capable of achieving this?

34:56.429 --> 34:58.963
Two years ago, I didn't
think I was capable

34:58.965 --> 35:00.798
of living in this world.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.801
And now, as you said, this is my family.

35:03.803 --> 35:07.338
And that can include you, if you'd like.

35:07.340 --> 35:09.607
I will be in touch.

35:09.609 --> 35:12.277
If you'd like to see
what I'm capable of...

35:15.181 --> 35:16.380
Just watch.

35:58.034 --> 35:59.867
Heads up, he's moving.

36:13.887 --> 36:16.822
Careful. We can't provoke anything.

36:22.262 --> 36:23.461
Argh!

36:30.738 --> 36:32.070
He just killed him!

36:35.442 --> 36:37.442
- That guy didn't even do anything.
- He didn't have to,

36:37.444 --> 36:40.245
that was for us, to prove a point.
He doesn't play by the rules.

36:40.247 --> 36:43.047
Well, we can't just sit here.
Someone's going to come by and see him.

36:43.049 --> 36:44.982
I'll hide the body for now.

36:44.984 --> 36:47.185
We dispose of him after we get the busboy
out of there and deal with the Albino.

36:47.187 --> 36:49.287
He moves a muscle, you honk that horn!

36:50.590 --> 36:52.690
You got it.

38:12.069 --> 38:14.536
Jorge! No, no, no, no!

38:17.841 --> 38:19.241
Gah!

38:47.870 --> 38:49.369
Excuse me?

38:49.394 --> 38:52.030
I don't mean to trouble you, I
can see that you're closing up

38:52.055 --> 38:54.522
but, I'm looking to rent a
house, I need something large,

38:54.524 --> 38:56.952
- with a lot of land?
- We only had one like that,

38:57.022 --> 39:00.213
but it was just rented out
for the next few months.

39:00.215 --> 39:01.915
You know, that might still work,

39:01.917 --> 39:03.517
I only need it for the end of the year.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.053
Do you have a listing?

39:07.055 --> 39:08.721
It would save me a trip in tomorrow.

39:08.723 --> 39:10.891
Yeah, uh, just a sec.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.225
Yeah.

39:13.595 --> 39:15.061
Rosenmount Estate.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.562
Five miles north, 100 acres.

39:16.564 --> 39:18.665
I can give you a call when
it's back on the market.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.533
It's beautiful.

39:20.535 --> 39:23.603
Hope it's not a bunch of college
kids renting it right now.

39:23.605 --> 39:25.070
Visiting businessmen.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.572
Russian, I think.

39:26.574 --> 39:29.709
He said he only needed it
short term, month to month.

39:29.711 --> 39:32.412
I've taken enough of your
time today, thank you.

39:32.414 --> 39:34.447
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

39:34.449 --> 39:35.581
You do that.

39:54.935 --> 39:56.702
I stepped away for two minutes.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.405
There was no way he could reach Jorge.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.607
It's not your fault.

40:03.944 --> 40:05.711
I don't know how to stop him.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.781
We stop him.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.650
Together.

40:12.652 --> 40:14.285
But you're on his list.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.120
Sasha's on his list.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.756
So are Katia and Alexei.

40:18.758 --> 40:22.126
We're all dead if we
don't take back control.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.462
So what's the plan?

40:24.464 --> 40:27.297
We help Jeremy kill Roman,

40:27.299 --> 40:29.600
before his assassin kills us.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.306
So what now?

40:36.308 --> 40:38.108
I take you back to Stonehaven.

40:38.110 --> 40:40.444
You're your father's
problem from here on out.

40:41.614 --> 40:43.413
I was never going to give up Rocco.

40:44.616 --> 40:46.483
I did it because of Roman's hitman.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.952
Because of what he did to my mother.

40:48.954 --> 40:51.488
She didn't stand a
chance, it was so fast.

40:51.490 --> 40:53.290
She couldn't fight back.

40:54.326 --> 40:56.193
He didn't know we were hiding,

40:56.195 --> 40:58.161
we were under a wool blanket.

40:58.163 --> 41:00.463
That's the only thing that saved us.

41:04.002 --> 41:05.334
He tore my mother's throat out.

41:05.336 --> 41:07.637
Like she was made from paper.

41:09.340 --> 41:12.141
I saw the life drain from her eyes.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.779
And I felt my brother's terror.

41:17.815 --> 41:21.150
And I wasn't going to let any
of us get hurt by him again.

41:22.520 --> 41:25.187
And I'm sorry if I
panicked and I took Rocco,

41:25.189 --> 41:27.056
but I thought the only way to stop him,

41:27.058 --> 41:29.158
to stop all of this, was to kill Roman.
