00:20.228 --> 00:22.814
- Please state your full name.
- Frank Castle.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.708
And you confirm that the statement

00:24.732 --> 00:26.127
you are about to give
has not been coerced.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.421
That no amnesty or immunity
for any crimes you've committed...

00:28.445 --> 00:30.589
- Jesus Christ.
- ...have been offered or implied

00:30.613 --> 00:32.615
- in exchange for your testimony.
- Wow...

00:32.698 --> 00:35.535
- Gotta cover your ass, huh, Madani?
- Answer the question.

00:35.618 --> 00:39.622
No deals. No guarantees.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.083
- Mr. Castle...
- Yeah?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.626
You served many years
as a Marine Force Recon?

00:43.710 --> 00:44.836
I did.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.381
But that isn't where
you served your last mission?

00:48.465 --> 00:53.136
No. I was part of a covert CIA operation.
It was called Cerberus.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.405
And what was the aim of Cerberus?

00:54.429 --> 00:57.390
Mission Cerberus was
to apprehend, interrogate,

00:57.474 --> 01:00.185
assassinate high-value targets
in Afghanistan.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.205
There is no official record
of any such mission.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.664
Come on, Madani, you know why that is.

01:03.688 --> 01:04.855
Why would you ask me that?

01:04.938 --> 01:06.149
Look, I need it on tape.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.193
Okay.
The reason why you haven't heard of it

01:08.276 --> 01:09.753
is 'cause the whole thing was illegal.

01:09.777 --> 01:14.199
It's a private death squad funded
by smuggling heroin out of Kandahar. Good?

01:14.282 --> 01:16.534
Okay, and who was running the show?

01:16.618 --> 01:22.290
Colonel Schoonover, Colonel Morty Bennett
and your guy, Carson Wolf. All deceased.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.584
- You killed them?
- I did.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.795
Well, not Bennett.
His, uh... his friends did that.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.922
I guess you could say
I put a target on his back.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.299
Target for who?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.178
The man in charge.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.389
William J. Rawlins.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.643
Head of covert operations, CIA.
Whole thing was his baby.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.646
Anyone else involved?

01:46.856 --> 01:47.857
Yeah.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.443
There was a marine.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.069
Billy Russo.

01:53.155 --> 01:56.199
Think I have some more shit
you already knew, right, Madani?

02:16.803 --> 02:17.929
It's okay.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.517
Leo, you're safe.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.103
What about Mom and Zach?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.275
Yeah, we're all working on that.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.652
It's gonna be okay.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.946
How do you know?

02:37.073 --> 02:38.450
I'm gonna make sure.

02:45.998 --> 02:49.211
What happened, Dad?

02:49.294 --> 02:53.465
We thought you were dead.
We had a funeral.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.674
I know.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.760
- Everything people said about...
- I know, I know.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.307
I was trying to protect you,
and I know...

03:02.390 --> 03:05.184
I know that it doesn't feel
like that right now, and I...

03:06.603 --> 03:08.187
I did a lousy job.

03:10.898 --> 03:12.692
But I'm gonna make everything all right.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.152
Okay?

03:21.743 --> 03:24.871
You're going away again, aren't you?
You and Pete.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.167
You're going to go and do something.
I don't want you to go.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.296
We gotta go get Mom and your brother.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.634
What if you don't?

03:42.347 --> 03:43.473
Please state your full name.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.393
I'm sorry. Let me just stop you
right there, Agent Madani.

03:46.476 --> 03:50.313
I... This isn't gonna be some
by-the-book Q and A, okay?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.625
I think, fundamentally, you and I,
we want the same things.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.942
We want the same people in custody, but...

03:56.027 --> 03:57.279
that's not my priority.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.864
My priority is my family.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.117
My wife. My son.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.389
You help me get 'em back,
I'll give you what you want.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.181
- Yeah, what do I want?
- You want evidence

04:08.205 --> 04:10.207
proving William Rawlins
killed Ahmad Zubair.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.001
You want a video.

04:12.084 --> 04:14.845
A video that I already sent you,
which you carelessly managed to lose.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.757
- A video that already got me killed once.
- Killed by who?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.801
You want that video so that Frank Castle
can point at himself on the screen

04:21.844 --> 04:25.265
and then point at William Rawlins
and then say, "That's your guy."

04:25.348 --> 04:26.849
And then you want justice...

04:27.975 --> 04:31.438
'cause you haven't figured out
that there is no such thing yet.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.233
- You don't believe in justice?
- No, I did.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.111
I did. You were it.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.863
You and the system.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.366
I've learned different.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.537
Good men have died trying
to expose this thing. They believed.

04:48.245 --> 04:51.291
Well, I believe the only way to get
these assholes is to become like them.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.126
No, I don't believe that.

04:58.631 --> 04:59.841
You will.

05:02.009 --> 05:03.260
In the end.

05:04.261 --> 05:05.763
I want my family safe.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.352
Help me get them back,
and I'll give you everything you need.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.019
Not before.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.693
One of your targets
was Ahmad Zubair.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.027
Yes, he was.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.697
So what happened to him?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.032
Look, Rawlins gives us a name.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.494
We go, we find him.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.704
We dragged him out of his house
in front of his kids.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.080
His wife was screaming.

05:31.163 --> 05:33.124
Same thing we did
to a bunch of other guys.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.209
Is that what you want to hear, Madani?

05:35.960 --> 05:38.254
- Zubair was tortured.
- That's right.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.839
- And then killed?
- Yeah.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.592
- And you witnessed all of this?
- I did.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.136
- Rawlins gave the order?
- Yeah.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.224
Look, Madani, it's all on that tape, okay?
Him, me, all of us.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.895
It damns us all.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.442
Rawlins gave the order.
Did Billy Russo pull the trigger?

05:59.526 --> 06:00.985
No, he did not.

06:03.905 --> 06:04.906
I did.

06:14.206 --> 06:16.125
You killed him?

06:16.208 --> 06:17.251
Yes, I did.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.758
Like I said, it damned us all.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.003
- They're late.
- Nah, they're here.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.379
They're watching us.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.759
Yeah? Why don't they
just shoot us where we stand?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.512
Who knows? Maybe they already...

07:52.138 --> 07:54.223
- Zach and Sarah, they...
- No.

07:54.306 --> 07:57.101
If they wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead, David.

07:57.184 --> 07:59.812
Shit you pulled with the computers,
it's working.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.065
Same on them as it worked on me.
It bought us leverage.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.359
- It's good.
- Yeah.

08:05.442 --> 08:07.862
- It's a goddamn death sentence.
- No.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.406
Hey, look, no second thoughts, okay?
You just...

08:11.658 --> 08:13.826
You quiet your mind.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.413
You don't have to do this.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.835
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to your wife and son. I'm just not.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.506
So whatever happens here,
we stick to the plan, okay?

08:26.589 --> 08:29.091
- Okay.
- We stick to the plan. Yeah?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.636
Yeah. Just, um...

08:33.136 --> 08:36.683
I gotta tell you, Frank, you know...
I know I can be difficult.

08:39.476 --> 08:41.979
What you're doing for my family,
I'm not gonna forget that.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.699
They're here.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.909
When you see them,
you keep it together, yeah?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.954
Let's do it.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.728
- Oh, shit.
- Easy.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.938
Easy, David.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.489
Easy. Remember the plan.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.869
Baby...

09:37.952 --> 09:39.536
Mom, it's Dad!

09:40.287 --> 09:41.873
It's Dad!

09:56.721 --> 09:58.073
- Um...
- It's okay.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.016
That is just for show. You hear me?

10:00.099 --> 10:02.393
It's for show.
They're not gonna do a damn thing.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.472
Just to make sure we behave.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.737
David...

10:17.199 --> 10:18.200
Yeah?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.746
So it's real simple.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.623
You and Lieberman get in the van.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.543
You do anything else,
the happy family turns into a bonfire.

10:28.878 --> 10:29.879
Um,

10:29.962 --> 10:31.815
the fact that I'm standing here
without a bullet in my head

10:31.839 --> 10:34.550
means you didn't get too far
with those computers, right?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.974
Well, we both got things
we want here.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.722
So let's get through this nice and smooth.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.434
No tricks. Start walking.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.644
Sounds good.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.274
Move!

10:52.609 --> 10:54.987
David?

10:56.781 --> 10:57.782
Easy.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.498
Stay calm.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.128
- Dad?
- David?

11:11.212 --> 11:14.215
You keep it together, David.
Keep walking.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.304
David...

11:22.724 --> 11:24.892
It's okay. Just keep walking. It's okay.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.645
- Easy.
- David...

11:36.153 --> 11:37.279
Shit.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.906
- Police!
- Shit!

11:42.659 --> 11:44.829
- Get him!
- In the van, now! Move!

11:44.912 --> 11:46.789
Move! Move! Move!

11:47.373 --> 11:50.001
No! No! Go!

11:51.460 --> 11:53.295
Go!

11:57.716 --> 11:59.010
Go! Go!

12:03.722 --> 12:05.450
- Get off... Get off of me!
- Get down!

12:05.474 --> 12:07.018
I need them both! Get Lieberman!

12:09.812 --> 12:12.356
- Come here! Come here.
- Let's go!

12:13.649 --> 12:15.567
Come here!

12:15.651 --> 12:18.529
- Come here!
- All right. Get out of there.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.092
- No!
- Take him down!

12:23.075 --> 12:27.413
- Shit!
- No! No!

12:27.496 --> 12:31.000
Get inside! Go, now! Get inside!

12:31.083 --> 12:32.459
Shit!

12:32.543 --> 12:34.253
- No!
- Get down!

12:36.255 --> 12:37.965
I said get the hell out of there!

12:40.968 --> 12:45.306
David! No!

12:45.848 --> 12:47.016
Get in the car!

12:59.987 --> 13:03.699
No! No!

13:56.919 --> 13:58.670
Welcome back.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.048
Nice place you got here.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.471
It looks better since I decorated
with your guys.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.059
- Well, there are always more guys.
- Mmm.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.895
Somebody always wants to get paid.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.565
I guess you'd be the expert
on that, wouldn't you, Bill?

14:27.616 --> 14:31.578
All those poor bastards
that we strung up back in the day...

14:33.289 --> 14:37.626
You know,
I never really thought to myself...

14:38.460 --> 14:43.966
"But for the Grace of God go I."
Well... you, in this case.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.554
Ticktock, Bill, huh? Ticktock.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.056
What was Homeland doing there?

14:51.432 --> 14:54.226
I don't know.
Nothing to do with me.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.311
Hmm.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.567
- Am I supposed to believe that?
- I don't give a shit what you believe.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.196
Uh, I don't know.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.614
Maybe Lieberman... Maybe he... Maybe he...

15:07.698 --> 15:10.242
He set it up behind my back.
Why don't you go ask him? Okay?

15:12.744 --> 15:13.745
What do you think, Billy?

15:13.829 --> 15:16.832
You think I wanted
you and Rawlins under arrest, huh?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.876
Locked up? Nah. No way.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.587
I'm gonna kill you, Bill.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.715
I'm gonna watch you die.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.346
Oh, man.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.725
You are a... trip. You know that?

15:35.977 --> 15:39.396
You really think that, huh?
You still think that you get to kill us?

15:39.480 --> 15:43.109
That you get to win?
You don't get to win, Frank.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.195
It's over.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.198
You have one choice left,
and that's how to die.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.782
That's all I can give you, man.

15:52.076 --> 15:56.247
Now, I kept my end of the deal.
Lieberman's wife and kid are free.

15:58.124 --> 15:58.958
Where is he?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.335
Tell me how to get
into those computers, Frank.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.878
I'll make this easy for you.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.796
Ask Lieberman.

16:05.714 --> 16:06.715
Hmm.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.803
Unfortunately,
your geek friend is no longer with us.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.309
You killed him?

16:19.186 --> 16:20.937
Homeland got sloppy.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.151
Put three bullets in him. Yeah.

16:25.942 --> 16:27.694
Shitty news for both of us.

16:28.820 --> 16:32.908
So now, this whole situation...

16:34.201 --> 16:35.744
becomes unavoidable.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.874
How 'bout my wife and kids?

16:42.709 --> 16:44.795
Was that unavoidable?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.591
Did you do it, Bill?

16:52.053 --> 16:53.887
Did you pull the trigger on my wife?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.183
On my son?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.062
My baby girl?

17:17.286 --> 17:18.537
All right.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.045
No.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.215
No, I wasn't there.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.192
If I was, you'd be in the ground,
because I wouldn't have missed.

17:34.886 --> 17:37.264
But I told them I'd have no part of it.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.189
But you knew about it, didn't you?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.276
Did you know about it, Bill?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.866
Yeah. I knew.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.462
She loved you.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.006
Look, it wasn't supposed to
go down like this, all right?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.317
- My kids loved you.
- If I could go back

18:12.341 --> 18:14.468
and change it, I would. But I can't.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.346
Frank...

18:19.765 --> 18:20.932
Frank, look at me.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.438
Look at me, Frank.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.239
I did not want this.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.368
I'm gonna kill you.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.789
No. No, you're not.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.169
All that's left is to decide how you die.
Easy or hard.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.852
- That's it. That's your choice.
- Shut up, Bill, just...

18:51.630 --> 18:53.024
There are worse things than dying, Bill.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.218
I wake up most mornings and I want it.
I hope for it.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.594
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:59.430 --> 19:03.267
You don't know shit about that,
but you will. You will.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.276
Well, then why don't you let me
help you out? Hmm?

19:14.861 --> 19:18.949
Okay. Okay, Bill, you win.

19:19.991 --> 19:21.327
I pick easy.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.830
Now shoot me. Do it.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.166
What is it?

19:29.460 --> 19:30.586
You can't, can you?

19:31.753 --> 19:34.673
Yeah, you got that unfinished business,
don't you, Bill?

19:34.756 --> 19:35.924
How's she doing over there?

19:36.007 --> 19:39.010
- How you doing over there? All right?
- Don't play with me, Frank.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.432
You tell me what happens
when those counters hit zero.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.728
Oh, all kinds of good shit, Bill.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.564
All kinds of good shit.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.873
Was the body bag really necessary?

20:07.956 --> 20:09.333
We had to make it look good.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.960
Nothing about this looks good.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.256
Sarah and Zach?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.941
They're doing okay,
all things considered.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.260
You mean considering they just saw me die?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.719
Hey, this was your idea.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.864
We told them you were okay
as soon as we got them out of there.

20:22.888 --> 20:26.600
All right, I need to see my family now.
Come on!

20:26.683 --> 20:28.519
- I'll take you to them.
- Okay.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.271
Maybe you change your clothes first.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.412
Hi.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.177
God damn you!

21:02.261 --> 21:05.847
You bastard. You bastard, what did you do?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.392
What did you do? We saw you die!

21:08.475 --> 21:12.187
We saw you die! We saw you die!

21:12.271 --> 21:14.189
You were dead for a year!

21:14.273 --> 21:15.857
- Mom, stop it.
- What did you do?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.360
What did you do?
We thought you were dead for a year.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.904
What did you do? Your kids...

21:20.987 --> 21:23.990
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

21:26.242 --> 21:27.369
Okay.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.713
I'm so, so sorry. Okay?

21:38.880 --> 21:41.383
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.733
It was always just the clothes
and cars and women with you.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.569
It's the only thing that ever mattered.

22:01.152 --> 22:03.029
It's what those things represent, Frank.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.573
What's that?

22:05.366 --> 22:07.075
How far I've come.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.495
It's about...

22:10.787 --> 22:12.956
who I see when I look in the mirror.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.084
I know who you see.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.005
You see a man who lost.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.927
Lost his family, lost his faith.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.431
About to lose his life.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.771
- That ain't never gonna be me.
- No?

22:37.105 --> 22:38.607
You're wrong, Bill.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.485
You already lost. You lost your honor.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.448
The second you took that money
from Rawlins...

22:47.408 --> 22:49.159
you became everything you hate.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.747
We've both been in rooms like these.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.042
We both know that every man breaks.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.964
Now, give me the passwords...

23:04.966 --> 23:06.468
and we can call it a day.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.971
Because it will get much more painful
if you don't.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.392
Yeah, I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

23:16.269 --> 23:20.273
What, you come here to tug
on your little doggy's leash, huh?

23:20.356 --> 23:23.026
All right, Bill, why don't you...
why don't you bark for him, huh?

23:23.109 --> 23:26.112
Maybe... maybe do a trick,
he'll throw you a bone, huh?

23:26.196 --> 23:29.074
He doesn't like that.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.243
You trust this piece of shit, Bill?

23:33.620 --> 23:36.020
How about Morty Bennett?
You think Morty Bennett trusted him?

23:36.081 --> 23:40.627
Billy and I have mutual interests, Frank.
What benefits him benefits me.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.229
Yeah, and how about
when it doesn't, asshole?

23:42.253 --> 23:43.547
What happens then?

23:44.965 --> 23:47.843
Your stupid-ass gloves. You...

23:47.926 --> 23:50.279
Are those the same ones,
or did you get yourself a new pair?

23:50.303 --> 23:53.890
These are special. Just for you.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.269
You gonna do something with them?

24:30.135 --> 24:32.303
You hit like a bitch, Rawlins.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.515
You hit like a bitch.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.642
That wasn't so bad.

26:13.238 --> 26:17.242
I mean, I can explain it...
I can explain it all.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.160
You know, in my head that... It was all...

26:21.747 --> 26:25.667
There was a reason for everything,
and one thing led to another thing...

26:27.085 --> 26:32.340
that led to this idea,
that led to this action, that...

26:35.343 --> 26:38.221
It was... It was never like, um...

26:43.101 --> 26:45.771
I was just, uh, reacting, you know?

26:46.647 --> 26:48.064
Trying to survive.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.525
Trying to get back home.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.195
Trying to win.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.868
I know that doesn't make up for...

27:08.168 --> 27:09.753
I am so sorry.

27:18.929 --> 27:22.265
I've been in my bathrobe
in a basement for a year.

27:22.348 --> 27:25.560
You look like it.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.741
Where is Frank?

27:46.622 --> 27:50.251
Where is he?
Um, he's where he wants to be.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.045
What does that mean?

27:56.382 --> 27:58.468
I let him do something really stupid.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.679
I gave him my word
I'd let him sacrifice himself for us.

28:03.473 --> 28:05.141
Are those men gonna kill him?

28:05.934 --> 28:09.229
If he doesn't kill them first.
All he wants is the chance.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.355
I hope he does it.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.481
Those men?

28:11.564 --> 28:14.109
They deserve to go to hell,
and I hope he sends them there.

28:19.322 --> 28:23.118
More likely he's being tortured
and/or killed right now.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.709
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it

28:25.746 --> 28:28.289
because we don't have
the first clue where he is.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.834
Right, Lieberman?

28:30.917 --> 28:32.836
We found it in the van they used.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.639
Fake your death,
take you out of the picture

28:34.712 --> 28:36.714
and then Castle leads us
back to Rawlins and Russo.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.593
That was the plan.
Now you're here and your family is alive,

28:40.676 --> 28:43.764
so please explain to me
why Frank screwed me?

28:44.765 --> 28:47.600
Uh, I don't know. That could have
fallen off when they grabbed him.

28:50.436 --> 28:51.646
Did you know?

28:51.730 --> 28:55.859
Uh, Frank doesn't really
play well with others.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.486
You know, he's not completely,
uh, socialized.

28:58.569 --> 29:00.696
Yeah, you're a lousy liar.

29:00.781 --> 29:03.658
Look, you got everything
that you wanted, right?

29:03.742 --> 29:06.286
Everything that you
and your superiors wanted.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.538
Frank's statement, Zubair footage...

29:08.621 --> 29:11.332
We kept up our half of the deal.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.293
I'll be really clear with you, okay?

29:13.376 --> 29:17.588
I owe him, not you. I can't dishonor that.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.887
You know,
you guys talk about honor, loyalty...

29:26.097 --> 29:28.141
Did you know it was Frank
who killed Zubair?

29:28.224 --> 29:29.976
There was no honor in that.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.645
It was murder.

29:32.728 --> 29:34.564
You think Frank doesn't know that?

29:34.647 --> 29:35.857
That haunts him.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.443
That, and everything that came after.

29:40.278 --> 29:43.824
Frank is resigned to die because
he's not sure that he deserves to live.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.492
That's a shame.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.619
So tell me where he is.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.104
This is some bullshit.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.367
It's not gonna happen, Frank.

30:32.705 --> 30:36.001
The mission ended.
That's the part you just...

30:37.168 --> 30:39.129
You don't seem to understand.

30:40.046 --> 30:43.633
Who are you protecting? Hmm?

30:45.343 --> 30:46.469
Maria?

30:52.142 --> 30:53.184
The kids?

30:55.937 --> 30:58.314
They're gone. Gunner, Lieberman...

31:00.275 --> 31:03.236
There's nobody left. They're dead.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.908
They're all dead because of you.

31:09.951 --> 31:10.994
I get it.

31:12.328 --> 31:16.291
I get it. That's a...
a heavy, heavy burden.

31:19.585 --> 31:21.212
It's time to put it down.

31:26.842 --> 31:28.094
You're a revenant.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.181
Walking the earth, completely unaware
that you're already dead.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.274
I hate seeing you like this.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.899
It's sad.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.069
Give it up, Frank.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.906
Give it up,
and I'll make it clean and fast.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.992
Go out like a soldier.

32:16.017 --> 32:20.063
Wait. No, wait. No, Maria.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.523
Frank?

32:24.067 --> 32:26.319
Frank.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.950
- Bill?
- Yeah.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.827
Yeah, it's me. I'm here.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.374
I'm ready, Bill.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.668
Okay.

32:45.296 --> 32:46.506
It's gotta be you.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.010
It's gotta be clean.

32:50.926 --> 32:52.387
Just don't let him take me, Bill.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.097
- You gotta promise me that.
- I won't.

32:55.931 --> 32:58.268
- I promise.
- Bill...

32:58.351 --> 32:59.978
Hey. Hey.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.526
I promise.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.405
- I promise.
- Okay.

33:12.615 --> 33:13.992
Okay.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.410
Okay.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.702
It's over there.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.540
It's a retinal scanner and a keystroke.

33:20.623 --> 33:23.251
My... my eye, my right hand.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.586
It's gotta be you, Bill.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.048
Let's get him upstairs.

33:33.719 --> 33:34.929
Move.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.187
- What's happening?
- He saw sense.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.032
Just so you know,
we found the gun you had under there.

34:17.429 --> 34:20.100
That's it.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.690
It's done.

34:34.655 --> 34:38.326
You know, I'm actually
a little disappointed in you, Castle.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.737
- Hey, sleepyhead...
- Mmm.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.325
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.579
What time is it?

35:23.663 --> 35:25.623
- It's 10:30.
- Oh, shit.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.834
You needed sleep.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.506
- Got plenty of time now that you're home.
- Yeah.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.510
- Where are the babies?
- They're playing.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.137
- Mmm.
- I told them to let you sleep.

35:39.845 --> 35:40.971
Hmm.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.068
This is the hardest part.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.655
You're back but you're not really here.

36:00.115 --> 36:02.117
More and more of you stays there.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.311
- Where's home, Frank?
- Stop it. I'm just...

36:10.335 --> 36:12.878
Is it here or is it there?
I wanna hear you say it.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.595
It's here.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.350
It's with you, always. You know that.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.688
I don't know that.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.818
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm just... Look, come on.

36:35.901 --> 36:37.027
Let's...

36:38.279 --> 36:42.408
I gotta hit the park today.
You know, painted ponies.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.912
- Eat a bunch of shitty food, right?
- Yeah.

36:46.996 --> 36:47.997
Yeah.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.468
I'm not...

37:03.513 --> 37:04.889
I'm not going back.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.105
I'm not. I'm gonna stay here. I'm done.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.733
Yeah.

37:17.443 --> 37:21.322
Yeah, I'm gonna stay with you.
I'm gonna stay home.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.198
- Yeah.
- Come on.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.181
This guy was good. We were never
getting in here without the codes.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.892
The back-up systems
and security are gnarly.

37:49.975 --> 37:51.018
I'd like to meet him.

37:51.101 --> 37:52.102
He's dead.

37:52.978 --> 37:56.023
Same as you'll be
if you ever discuss this with anyone.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.367
- Can you destroy it all?
- Already happening.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.409
This country needs me, Frank.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.202
I was the bulwark against our enemies.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.413
What I did was greater
than you could ever measure!

38:10.496 --> 38:12.707
Do you know what you've done?

38:12.790 --> 38:16.627
Did they take your pension away?
Did you... Oh, God!

38:16.711 --> 38:18.754
You are nothing but a grunt!

38:18.838 --> 38:20.840
You do not get to take me down.

38:20.923 --> 38:25.177
You are gonna beg to me.
Blood loss is gonna make you weak.

38:25.260 --> 38:28.306
You're gonna slip in and out of shock.
You will know pain and fear.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.392
Fear, Frank. Your ribs must be cracked.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.520
I'm gonna take
all the breath out of your lungs,

38:34.604 --> 38:36.564
out of your lungs,
until you can barely whisper

38:36.647 --> 38:39.149
and the last word
out of your mouth is gonna be,

38:39.233 --> 38:42.612
"Please... Please... Please..."

38:42.695 --> 38:46.491
All right. That's enough.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.702
We wipe everything and we're done.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.830
- Then I put him down.
- No.

38:52.913 --> 38:55.375
He's taken things from me.
For that he does not die easy.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.463
Well, I made him a promise.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.632
I don't care about your promise.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.014
You said he brought you down.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.224
Taken things from you.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.186
What, exactly?

39:38.208 --> 39:39.627
Yeah?

39:43.047 --> 39:45.132
Look, I made a promise to Frank.

39:45.215 --> 39:47.843
- What are you talking about?
- I need to access your computer.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.011
Please.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.684
Yeah, Frank didn't screw you, okay?

39:54.767 --> 39:58.228
Not completely. We just...
We didn't tell you everything.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.373
You have my password?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.816
You're about to be really glad about that.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.460
You gotta understand Frank.
The only thing

40:03.484 --> 40:05.152
he lives for is to kill these guys.

40:05.235 --> 40:07.822
So I promised
I would give him that chance.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.090
So, we set 'em up. The whole thing.

40:09.114 --> 40:10.926
We made sure there's only one place
they could take us.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.284
But with me dead...

40:12.367 --> 40:13.661
Frank's their only option.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.793
Oh.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.629
Shit.

40:23.713 --> 40:24.880
Where is this?

40:25.673 --> 40:27.508
Look at him. We gotta stop this.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.052
This is all recording?

40:30.135 --> 40:32.179
Yeah. Frank figured that
if he couldn't kill them,

40:32.262 --> 40:35.766
then at least you'd have enough evidence
on Rawlins and Russo,

40:35.850 --> 40:37.170
all the evidence you'd ever need.

40:37.226 --> 40:40.062
Please, Dinah, we gotta go get him
before it's too late.

40:41.481 --> 40:42.482
Please.

40:44.024 --> 40:48.446
You don't leave me, Frank.
Don't you leave me.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.115
You will say, "Please."

40:54.326 --> 40:55.870
This doesn't serve me.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.122
You serve me!

40:58.205 --> 41:00.958
You're a tool, you understand?
Just like he was.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.420
You've lost your mind.

41:05.505 --> 41:08.298
I was out of Afghanistan clean.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.926
None of this would be happening
if you hadn't gone after him.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.638
You pulled me back into the mud.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.557
I pulled you out of the mud, gutter rat!

41:16.641 --> 41:18.809
Billy, don't get confused.

41:18.893 --> 41:22.396
Men like me make the plans.
Men like you shed the blood.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.273
You think you're clean?

41:24.356 --> 41:26.567
Who killed Homeland agents, huh? Not me.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.736
No, I... I have everything.

41:28.819 --> 41:31.572
I have your doctored discharge papers,
the money transfers.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.033
You're only as clean as I let you be,

41:34.116 --> 41:37.537
because when it's all said and done,
you're just a stupid grunt, too.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.125
I should've let him kill you in that tent.

41:43.208 --> 41:45.545
But you didn't.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.130
- No.
- Hmm.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.508
I didn't.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.097
No, Russo. I will burn you.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.850
You will stand down, Lieutenant.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.896
You will not deny me this.

42:21.371 --> 42:22.540
You're a sick man.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.417
He owes me an eye.

42:37.304 --> 42:39.056
It's time.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.516
You have to choose.

42:42.434 --> 42:43.518
Choose...

42:45.520 --> 42:46.939
Don't make me do that.

42:48.273 --> 42:49.316
Come home, Frank.

42:51.235 --> 42:55.656
Stay with me, Frank.
You're gonna want to be awake for this.

43:05.207 --> 43:08.543
Adrenaline.
A little something for what ails you.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.340
Whoa! Oh, there he is.

43:13.423 --> 43:17.386
Oh. Boom, boom, boom. Look at that.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.054
Oh, you're really quite something.

43:22.057 --> 43:24.810
- Jesus, that's messed up.
- What do you want?

43:24.894 --> 43:26.520
I'm done. It's all gone.

43:28.563 --> 43:31.609
Get her out of here and pay her.
You know the drill.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.996
It was always gonna come down
to you and me, Frank.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.999
Time for quid pro quo.

43:47.082 --> 43:48.793
Come home, Frank.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.350
Let's go home.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.784
Boom, boom, boom.

44:23.994 --> 44:28.082
You're a dead man,
your heart just doesn't know it yet.

44:35.380 --> 44:36.924
I am home.

45:09.039 --> 45:11.250
You're wrong.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.552
I'm a reminder.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.522
Die!

46:23.488 --> 46:24.949
God damn, Frankie.

46:26.408 --> 46:28.202
I love to watch you work.

46:53.352 --> 46:56.605
I wish... I wish I could see your face...

46:56.688 --> 46:58.190
What are you talking about?

46:58.273 --> 46:59.441
When you realize...

47:00.317 --> 47:01.861
Realize what, Frankie?

47:04.071 --> 47:05.530
That you're done.

47:07.116 --> 47:10.285
You lost everything.
Everything you give a shit about is gone.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.121
Gone.

47:13.788 --> 47:15.165
This isn't my gun, Frank.

47:17.126 --> 47:18.127
I was never here.

47:20.045 --> 47:22.172
Homeland Security!
Drop your weapons!

47:22.256 --> 47:24.716
You sneaky son of a bitch.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.270
Move, move, move!

47:36.353 --> 47:38.772
Fan out. I want a full perimeter.
Lock this place down.

47:38.855 --> 47:41.191
Russo's injured but armed.
Search every area.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.860
Hey! Hey! Look at me.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.422
- He's breathing!
- Russo's injured but armed.

47:46.446 --> 47:48.716
- Treat him with extreme caution.
- We got to get him out of here.

47:48.740 --> 47:52.036
- I called an ambulance.
- No. No... Hospitals are cops.

47:54.829 --> 47:58.208
This man's dying for your justice.
Why don't you give him some?

48:00.127 --> 48:03.880
Hey, Frank! Hey! I betrayed you, okay?

48:03.964 --> 48:05.590
Listen to me, I betrayed you.

48:05.674 --> 48:08.302
I brought them here.
I brought them here, okay?

48:08.385 --> 48:11.388
Call me a piece of shit. Come on.
Call me an asshole. Come on.

48:11.471 --> 48:15.434
Call me a son of a bitch.
Come on. Come on!

48:15.517 --> 48:17.811
Call me a piece of shit! Let's go!

48:20.355 --> 48:21.982
My friend is dying...

48:25.235 --> 48:28.780
Come on, please, please. Please, please.

48:29.656 --> 48:30.782
Maria...

48:40.709 --> 48:43.087
There you go.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.548
Yes! Yeah, that's right,
you scary, beautiful man!

48:46.631 --> 48:48.758
That's right! Yeah.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.724
I got you. I got you.

49:06.568 --> 49:07.694
Home.
