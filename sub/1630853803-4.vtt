WEBVTT

01:24.418 --> 01:27.462
Now arriving at Montgomery Station.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.824
What are you doing here?

01:55.908 --> 01:58.243
I got a friend
in the Financial Crimes Unit.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.662
Tipped her off about the embezzlement
at your husband's company.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.167
And you had to tell me that in person?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.669
I didn't have to.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.019
I wanted to see you.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.522
I wanted to see you too.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.486
Look, FCU's gonna open
up their own investigation.

02:33.362 --> 02:36.615
They find out what we think they will,
they're gonna bring James in.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.659
Are you serious?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.245
-He could really go to jail for this?
-Yeah.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.664
-For all of it, even what he did to me?
-Yeah, well,

02:43.747 --> 02:46.333
we gotta bring him in on this,
then we can ask the other questions.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.964
What's wrong?

02:53.549 --> 02:55.217
Is anyone gonna believe me…

02:56.927 --> 02:59.429
if I can't even remember
what happened that day?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.932
We'll present the case together,
I'll be right there with you.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.935
Yeah, but it's still my word against his.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.312
Just take it one step at a time, okay?

03:08.856 --> 03:11.733
I'm working a new angle.
Someone on the inside of the firm.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.570
If we can find out exactly
how much money we're missing,

03:14.653 --> 03:16.947
-FCU can start to track it.
-You need to know how much.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.032
-So what do I do?
-You?

03:19.116 --> 03:20.576
-Yeah.
-Nothing.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.829
But I'm around him all the time.
There must be something--

03:23.912 --> 03:26.164
You can't, all right? It's too dangerous.

03:26.248 --> 03:29.001
He could get scared,
he could do something stupid.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.211
I won't let that happen.

03:31.295 --> 03:33.755
From now on,
you and I are in this together.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.603
Be careful.

03:48.979 --> 03:49.980
You too.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.536
Everyone has secrets, right?

04:05.495 --> 04:08.582
Parts of themselves they don't even share
with their friends, or their family,

04:08.665 --> 04:09.917
or their partners?

04:10.501 --> 04:12.503
And aren't those secrets,

04:12.586 --> 04:15.631
those private parts
of ourselves no one else knows,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.634
aren't they what make us
who we really are?

04:19.301 --> 04:22.095
I understand you wanting
to know those things,

04:22.179 --> 04:26.683
but my concern is
that you won't be able to access them.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.270
And the more you try,
the more frustrated you'll become.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.397
But I have to at least try.

04:35.150 --> 04:40.280
The things we've had the most success with
are the ones that push the boundaries,

04:40.364 --> 04:43.116
the hypnosis, neurofeedback.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.078
We can revisit
those techniques if you'd like.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.247
There's this clinic.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.125
They do trauma processing
and memory recovery.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.962
-More experimental therapies.
-Sophie--

04:55.045 --> 04:56.463
And as you know,

04:56.547 --> 05:01.802
my conservatorship prevents me
from making any decisions about my life.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.137
I don't have access to my own money.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.809
And the only way James will agree
to pay for it,

05:10.435 --> 05:11.854
is if you sign off.

05:12.521 --> 05:17.192
I've told you before,
those clinics are dangerous.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.153
Especially for someone like you.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.115
Someone like me?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.121
Someone who's still fragile.

05:37.462 --> 05:42.259
I care about you very much,
Sophie. I trust that you know that.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.471
If you want to get your life back,

05:47.055 --> 05:49.516
the hard work that we've been doing here

05:49.600 --> 05:52.978
for the last four months
is what it's gonna take.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.480
It's just you and me

05:55.564 --> 05:59.318
showing up here every week,
doing the work.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.038
Seriously, man. You look like shit.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.748
-People are starting to notice.
-Stop.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.000
Just tell me you got a plan.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.628
-Something. Anything.
-Just keep your voice down.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.756
Well, you do realize
that me just knowing about this shit,

06:20.839 --> 06:22.257
makes me complicit, right?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.677
You're right.
I shouldn't have said anything.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.222
No. Hey, I can keep a secret
with the best of 'em.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.183
Dead hooker in a hotel room? No problem.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.436
You've got your fucking dick stuck
in a hamster wheel? I'm your guy.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.688
But if you don't do something about this--

06:36.772 --> 06:40.734
this multimillion dollar albatross
you've stuck around my neck,

06:40.817 --> 06:43.570
things are gonna end badly for both of us.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.822
Look, I--

06:47.574 --> 06:49.243
I hit some dead ends.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.286
But I have one more shot.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.164
Someone with deep pockets
that I can go to for a favor.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.167
Oh, yeah, well,
they better be pretty fucking deep, man.

06:57.251 --> 07:00.170
I already put back a few million.
I'm gonna put back the rest.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.883
Look, the police--
they're not even involved yet.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.886
The internal investigator, she's days away
from really knowing anything--

07:07.970 --> 07:09.888
Veronica Mars over there? Fuck her.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.558
All the partners care
about is making the company whole.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.435
They're not going to sound alarm bells
over something like wire fraud.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.855
They don't want that attention
any more than we do.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.232
At the end of the day,

07:20.315 --> 07:24.611
as long as I put the money back,
this… this all goes away.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.365
Yeah, well, you better be right because,
you know,

07:28.448 --> 07:32.119
I might believe you when you say
that none of this is really your fault.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.495
No one else will.

07:33.579 --> 07:38.292
Look, I'm not gonna let
this mistake ruin my life, or yours.

07:47.092 --> 07:50.679
I'll give you 48 hours
to make a serious dent.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.931
Then I go to the partners myself.

07:54.766 --> 07:58.437
You know you're like family to me,
man, but fuck prison.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.874
Hey, it's me.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.586
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.508
I was wondering can you meet later?

08:30.344 --> 08:32.888
No. At the office.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.755
Mrs. Ellis. So good to see you again.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.216
You too.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.260
Let me show you this new watch we got in.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.804
I think it would be perfect
for your collection.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.061
Actually,
this is gonna sound sort of strange,

10:03.145 --> 10:07.524
but I brought in a few pieces
I was hoping to sell.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.278
I saw online you might
do that sort of thing?

10:11.361 --> 10:13.322
The buyback program. Of course.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.158
Would you mind taking a look?

10:16.825 --> 10:19.036
Give me a sense of what they're worth?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.621
Yes, of course.

10:30.923 --> 10:34.927
I just wanted to make space
for some new pieces in the collection.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.600
You know how it is.
Always got your eye on something shinier.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.483
Unfortunately, the necklace is engraved.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.610
We won't be able
to do anything with this one.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.948
And the other ones?

10:57.616 --> 10:58.909
Excuse me one moment.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.306
The rest are worth at least 15,000.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.812
How does it work, exactly?
I get the money today?

11:26.895 --> 11:29.314
Sure.
I just have to process some paperwork.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.109
This one was a gift
from your husband, if I recall,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.528
so it'll go straight back on his card.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.572
-The--
-Wait.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.953
If he sees I've returned it,
I'll never hear the end of it.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.622
Is there any other option?

11:47.124 --> 11:48.458
I could cut you a check.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.545
But the manager would have to sign off,
if you don't mind waiting?

11:53.881 --> 11:56.633
You know, cash would be great.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.179
I'll see what I can do.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.026
-On your tab?
-Yeah, please. Appreciate it.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.628
I need a vodka soda.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.425
You partying?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.639
It's fucking happy hour, dude.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.182
Okay, my bad.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.018
Got the hookup, that's all.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.858
What kind of hookup?

12:56.735 --> 12:59.446
-What do you need?
-Well, there's a party later.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.324
Might be nice to show up
with some supplies.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.326
Yeah.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.203
I got coke. Molly.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.164
I got moon rocks. Less of a hangover.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.875
Everybody gotta work tomorrow, right?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.547
-How much you got on you?
-How much you need?

13:17.548 --> 13:19.383
-Two grams?
-How about five?

13:23.011 --> 13:24.263
Moon rocks, huh?

13:25.264 --> 13:28.141
-Thought that was an urban legend.
-Nah.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.935
Hey, you got any of those Magic Blooms?

13:30.018 --> 13:33.605
I listened to this whole podcast
on synthetic psychedelics the other night.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.900
-Pretty chill.
-I bet.

13:36.984 --> 13:37.985
Uh-huh.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.164
Well, thanks
for inviting me, but this party sucks.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.292
I'm sorry.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.421
I know it's late. Thanks for coming.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.340
So, what's the emergency?

14:02.759 --> 14:05.179
Look,
in the whole time we've known each other,

14:05.262 --> 14:09.057
I've never asked you
for anything like this before.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.726
Even when I could've used it.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.770
And God knows,
there were times I could've used it.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.482
Look, there was…

14:19.067 --> 14:22.946
there was this deal,
and I have some money tied up.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.323
How much do you need?

14:26.700 --> 14:27.951
Nine million.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.581
What the fuck, James?

14:32.664 --> 14:36.460
It's just a timing hiccup
with a deal. Liquidity issues. That's all.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.712
-"Liquidity issues"?
-Look, I'll pay you back.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.006
-I know it sounds like a lot.
-It is a lot.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.509
Yeah. It is a lot.

14:43.592 --> 14:46.053
But there's no one else
in the world that I…

14:47.471 --> 14:49.097
that I trust enough to ask.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.350
Jesus, James.

14:57.231 --> 14:58.649
The best I can do is four.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.154
And even then,
I'm gonna need to move some things around.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.865
Thank you.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.743
You have no idea how much this means.
Thank you.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.579
Are you gonna tell me
why you really need this?

15:12.663 --> 15:14.164
Or do I not wanna know?

15:17.084 --> 15:20.504
The account to wire it to.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.925
Tomorrow would be ideal. Thank you.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.513
Have you thought about what I said?
About Sophie?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.599
Yeah.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.477
Yeah.

15:35.561 --> 15:38.564
It's time to be honest with her.
It's past time.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.776
Look,
I know you want what's best for Sophie.

15:42.860 --> 15:45.070
It's a lot more complicated than that.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.743
Sometimes stirring up the past,
it does more harm than good.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.879
You know a withdrawal of this size will
almost certainly be flagged for review.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.425
Whatever you've gotten yourself into…

16:08.051 --> 16:10.137
I really hope you know your way out.

16:35.829 --> 16:39.416
Hi. Welcome to Encounter Wellness.
Can I help you?

16:39.917 --> 16:44.296
Yes. Yeah,
I was hoping to make an appointment.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.131
Are you a member?

16:46.215 --> 16:49.218
Not yet. Can I sign up?

16:49.301 --> 16:52.721
Certainly.
I just need you to fill out a few forms.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.101
And a credit card for the membership fee.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.439
-How much?
-Five thousand to start.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.113
Is cash okay?

17:10.196 --> 17:11.573
I don't see why not.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.537
Hey, Dr. Patterson.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.998
Yes. We have a new client up front.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.127
The ethos
is nontraditional healing therapies

17:24.211 --> 17:25.921
backed by cutting-edge science.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.464
-Best of both worlds.
-Exactly.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.342
Sophie, right?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.929
What kind of challenges
can we help you face today?

17:35.347 --> 17:38.684
I recently lost my long-term memory.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.144
Everything?

17:43.480 --> 17:44.898
That must be terrifying.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.650
That's pretty accurate.

17:49.778 --> 17:53.240
Do you think I can recover things?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.200
All the other doctors--

17:55.284 --> 17:58.745
No one seems very confident
that that could happen.

18:00.247 --> 18:04.168
You have to be willing to take some risks,
but I think we can help.

18:05.294 --> 18:06.461
Really?

18:07.004 --> 18:08.547
What would you recommend?

18:08.630 --> 18:11.091
Well, we would start off
with tools to reduce your stress.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.593
Clear your mind.

18:13.385 --> 18:17.014
And then we could start using some
of our more specialized techniques.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.223
Like?

18:18.307 --> 18:20.517
We've cultivated our very own
proprietary mix

18:20.601 --> 18:22.186
of ketamine and psilocybin.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.229
It helps our patients

18:24.313 --> 18:27.524
make a deeper connection
with their subconscious.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.611
And I think, eventually,
you could benefit.

18:32.196 --> 18:35.199
Really? That's a type of therapy?

18:35.282 --> 18:38.702
Well, hallucinogens have long been known
to create new cerebral connections.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.955
Do you mind if I ask,

18:42.039 --> 18:46.418
was the cause of your memory loss
organic or psychogenic?

18:47.002 --> 18:48.003
Psychogenic?

18:48.629 --> 18:51.548
Caused by emotional
trauma, rather than a physical injury.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.431
I fell from the side of a ferry.

19:00.349 --> 19:03.268
One of those freak accidents
you'd never think would happen.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.314
I'm sure the circumstances
around the accident

19:07.397 --> 19:09.816
were emotionally traumatic as well.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.280
You could say that.

19:15.364 --> 19:17.741
What do you want to get out of this,
Sophie?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.077
I need to remember something specific.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.913
I'm close, but there are missing pieces.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.667
I think I know where we should start.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.461
We have to shut out the noise,

19:30.128 --> 19:31.880
quiet all your senses.

19:32.548 --> 19:35.050
You're left with nothing
but your subconscious.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.597
Don't be alarmed
if what surfaces troubles you.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.478
These troubling memories
are often the first to come back…

19:48.438 --> 19:50.858
because they're tied
to the strongest emotions.

19:52.985 --> 19:55.070
The patterns of behavior we repeat.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.492
You jumped.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.478
Don't be alarmed
if what surfaces troubles you.

21:13.732 --> 21:17.027
There's something about you, Tess.

23:12.893 --> 23:14.186
What's the occasion?

23:14.895 --> 23:17.689
When were you going to tell me
it was our anniversary?

23:18.524 --> 23:19.900
It was two months ago.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.278
You found the necklace.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.324
Look, I'm sorry I didn't say anything.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.993
You know, at the time we were so…

23:33.622 --> 23:37.084
Well, better late than never.

23:39.294 --> 23:42.297
I thought we could celebrate.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.634
Tonight?

23:46.760 --> 23:49.096
I booked a suite at the Palace Hotel.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.891
That's where we got married, right?

23:53.809 --> 23:57.145
-Yeah.
-We can have dinner, drinks.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.356
Spend the night.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.442
Connect.

24:05.529 --> 24:10.993
It's just not a great time.
There's a lot going on at work.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.495
Maybe we could do it in a few weeks.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.625
Right. Of course.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.754
I should have checked with you first.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.466
I'll call and cancel.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.137
No, fuck it. Let's go.

24:34.141 --> 24:35.517
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:37.311 --> 24:42.232
Look, I might have a few work calls
that I have to do, but…

24:45.277 --> 24:46.278
let's go.

24:49.114 --> 24:50.324
As long as we're together.

25:10.552 --> 25:13.222
Champagne seems appropriate. Two, please.

25:13.305 --> 25:14.306
Okay.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.895
-Hi. How are you?
-Good day. Fine. Yourself?

25:19.978 --> 25:21.772
I'm good. Are you here alone?

25:21.855 --> 25:23.398
Actually, I'm meeting someone.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.442
That's okay. Thanks.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.364
-Hi. How are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

25:30.447 --> 25:32.324
I'm doing good.
What are you doing tonight?

25:34.117 --> 25:36.119
Wow. That's why you look so good.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.874
-Oh, yeah.
-Will that be everything?

25:41.667 --> 25:42.668
Yes.

25:44.837 --> 25:45.879
Thank you.

25:54.388 --> 25:57.307
Good news.
The suite should be ready by now.

25:58.976 --> 26:01.520
How about a toast before we go up?

26:13.824 --> 26:15.993
To us.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.077
To us.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.667
Happy anniversary, babe.

26:28.338 --> 26:29.631
Yeah.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.341
I'm sorry.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.387
I have to take this.

26:36.555 --> 26:37.890
I'll go freshen up.

26:37.973 --> 26:38.974
Yeah?

26:46.690 --> 26:48.859
-Hey.
-Sorry to bother you, sir.

26:48.942 --> 26:52.362
But the investigator's here.
She's asking for access to your files.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.493
Doesn't she have a family to go home to?

26:58.577 --> 27:01.121
-A dog to feed, something?
-I don't know, sir. I'm sorry.

27:01.205 --> 27:02.497
Maybe I can buy some time.

27:02.581 --> 27:06.460
Look, don't give her anything.
I'll deal with it myself tomorrow.

27:07.377 --> 27:10.339
-Wait, seriously?
-Do I sound fucking serious, Todd?

27:10.422 --> 27:12.090
Well, what am I supposed to tell her?

27:12.174 --> 27:13.175
Figure it out.

27:14.051 --> 27:15.052
Okay.

27:29.316 --> 27:30.317
Nice bag.

27:31.527 --> 27:32.528
Thank you.

27:39.618 --> 27:40.869
Do you work here?

27:42.079 --> 27:43.080
Sort of.

27:47.251 --> 27:48.502
How do you do it?

27:49.294 --> 27:50.504
How do I do what?

27:51.630 --> 27:52.631
Make them believe.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.345
I saw you in the bar.

28:00.639 --> 28:05.435
Well, I make them believe
by believing it myself.

28:08.397 --> 28:09.398
Really?

28:10.399 --> 28:11.733
For a moment.

28:13.986 --> 28:16.363
Then I go home
and have a really hot shower.

28:17.364 --> 28:18.615
And come back to myself.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.176
What's that for?

28:38.677 --> 28:39.678
A kiss.

28:42.681 --> 28:43.974
For you?

28:44.558 --> 28:46.268
Easiest money you'll make all night.

28:59.865 --> 29:01.450
Is that what you were looking for?

29:03.911 --> 29:04.995
Thanks.

29:06.538 --> 29:07.748
If you say so.

29:25.724 --> 29:26.725
There you are.

29:28.310 --> 29:30.312
The room should be ready.
We should head up.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.065
You know what?

29:33.148 --> 29:37.069
Why don't you
show me to the ballroom instead?

29:38.195 --> 29:39.738
The ballroom? Why?

29:40.405 --> 29:43.659
Our wedding. I've only seen photos.

29:44.535 --> 29:46.620
I thought it'd be nice
to see it in person.

29:47.663 --> 29:48.664
Reminisce.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.541
While we're here.

29:53.335 --> 29:54.461
Okay, yeah.

30:06.682 --> 30:09.852
Jesus Christ, man.
What the fuck are you doing?

30:09.935 --> 30:11.937
I used to love this shit as a kid.

30:12.020 --> 30:14.022
It really holds up.
Even the shitty aftertaste.

30:14.106 --> 30:16.149
Man,
you ever heard of breaking and entering?

30:17.568 --> 30:20.112
Looks more like search and seizure
from where I'm sitting.

30:22.281 --> 30:23.448
Okay. Look, man…

30:24.825 --> 30:27.411
I was just doing a favor
for some assholes throwing a party.

30:28.829 --> 30:31.206
Yo, I swear.
I've never done this kind of thing before.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.291
Come on, bro.

30:32.374 --> 30:34.710
Sure, I've gone to a couple of parties,
done a few drugs.

30:34.793 --> 30:37.045
But, I mean, who hasn't, right?
I'm not like a…

30:39.548 --> 30:42.801
-I'm not like a drug dealer.
-Well, you are what you do, Todd.

30:42.885 --> 30:43.969
That was my first time.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.221
Yeah, but the problem is
the law doesn't distinguish.

30:46.305 --> 30:48.432
It puts me in a tough spot.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.934
The second you convinced me
to sell you that extra bag--

30:51.018 --> 30:53.520
No, no. You were the one
that convinced me.

30:53.604 --> 30:55.063
That's not how I remember it, Todd.

30:55.147 --> 30:57.900
Yeah, man, I was perfectly happy
just to buy one bag, and then you--

30:57.983 --> 31:01.028
You sure your little extracurriculars
aren't affecting your memory, Todd?

31:01.111 --> 31:03.697
Because I very clearly remember
you drove a hard bargain

31:03.780 --> 31:04.823
for that second bag.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.742
No, this is fucking entrapment.

31:06.825 --> 31:08.243
-You really feel that way?
-Yeah.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.995
Well, maybe you should tell someone, huh?

31:10.078 --> 31:13.498
Here, why don't you call my supervisor

31:13.582 --> 31:15.918
and explain to him
how you didn't mean to buy pure MDMA

31:16.001 --> 31:19.046
from an undercover narcotics officer.
Then explain the same thing to a judge.

31:19.129 --> 31:22.424
And then watch that judge explain to you
that his hands are tied,

31:22.508 --> 31:25.260
because the second you bought that
extra bag, it became intent to distribute

31:25.344 --> 31:27.971
with a mandatory
five-year minimum sentence.

31:31.475 --> 31:32.768
Just breathe, Todd.

31:34.102 --> 31:36.104
It's okay.
There is another way out of this.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.482
All I need is one small favor from you.

31:39.149 --> 31:40.817
You work at Ascendant, right?

31:40.901 --> 31:42.819
I heard there's an investigation.

31:42.903 --> 31:44.696
You're a fucking psycho.

31:45.531 --> 31:49.910
No. I'm just trying very hard
to protect someone very important to me.

32:01.922 --> 32:05.259
So… what was it like?

32:06.218 --> 32:07.594
Oh, my God.

32:08.929 --> 32:10.764
Do we really have to do this?

32:11.849 --> 32:15.561
It just feels so strange not to know.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.316
Well…

32:25.237 --> 32:29.366
The altar was set up over there,

32:30.784 --> 32:31.785
and…

32:33.412 --> 32:36.498
the guests sat here.

32:39.835 --> 32:41.044
How did you feel?

32:42.796 --> 32:43.797
Nervous.

32:43.881 --> 32:46.216
Yeah. No.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.634
Nervous isn't the right word.

32:47.718 --> 32:51.180
There… were butterflies?

32:54.016 --> 32:59.271
You came through these doors over here.

33:00.647 --> 33:04.443
I mean, the pictures,
they don't do it justice.

33:06.028 --> 33:07.154
You were stunning.

33:09.072 --> 33:13.160
We said the words, we had dinner, wine…

33:15.662 --> 33:16.663
you know.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.208
Then what?

33:21.668 --> 33:23.045
Then we danced.

33:24.546 --> 33:25.714
All night long.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.218
In our own little world.

33:37.976 --> 33:39.102
What's wrong?

33:44.483 --> 33:45.484
Nothing.

33:49.655 --> 33:52.908
James, I'm still here.

33:56.203 --> 33:58.622
Sometimes it feels like you're here, and…

34:01.375 --> 34:02.751
sometimes you're gone.

34:07.589 --> 34:08.590
Let's go.

34:09.882 --> 34:10.884
Where?

34:21.895 --> 34:24.398
What are you doing?
I thought you wanted to go up to the room.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.819
Come in here. With me.

34:58.599 --> 34:59.850
What are we doing here?

35:04.188 --> 35:05.189
James?

35:10.694 --> 35:11.987
Our wedding night…

35:15.324 --> 35:16.533
we ended up here.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.119
What?

35:20.329 --> 35:25.209
After everyone went to bed,
we couldn't sleep so we snuck in here

35:25.292 --> 35:26.668
and went for a swim.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.670
Just the two of us.

35:31.381 --> 35:34.218
But you'll never remember that, will you?

35:36.345 --> 35:39.139
You'll never remember
walking down that aisle.

35:40.349 --> 35:41.558
First time we met.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.978
How we came together, how all that felt.

35:51.026 --> 35:55.447
Instead, you just woke up one day,
stuck with me.

36:00.202 --> 36:01.703
-No.
-Yeah.

36:01.787 --> 36:02.955
No.

37:22.075 --> 37:23.285
Everything all right?

37:24.369 --> 37:25.370
Yeah.

37:26.413 --> 37:29.208
I could feel you pulling
in another direction all night.

37:30.459 --> 37:32.002
I know. I'm sorry.

37:33.378 --> 37:37.799
Don't be. I just want you to know
you can talk to me about it.

37:38.634 --> 37:40.010
Whatever's bothering you.

37:41.345 --> 37:42.513
I know.

37:42.596 --> 37:45.432
You've been there for me
through everything.

37:47.559 --> 37:49.186
Who's been there for you, you know?

37:51.104 --> 37:52.231
Well, you have.

37:54.691 --> 37:55.776
Not really.

37:57.653 --> 37:59.154
Not unless you let me be.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.076
Sophie, what's going on?

38:05.410 --> 38:08.830
Nothing.
I just want to know I'm doing my part.

38:14.378 --> 38:15.462
Look, it's…

38:20.551 --> 38:22.302
an issue at work. Just--

38:23.303 --> 38:25.430
Someone made a mistake, and…

38:27.182 --> 38:28.600
I'm trying to help him out.

38:31.311 --> 38:32.604
Because they deserve it.

38:34.898 --> 38:37.025
Must have been a pretty big mistake.

38:37.818 --> 38:40.487
Not like you to blow things
out of proportion.

38:43.031 --> 38:44.032
Well, it…

38:50.956 --> 38:54.209
It involves a not-insignificant
amount of money.

38:57.296 --> 38:58.297
How much?

38:59.840 --> 39:00.841
Eleven million.

39:06.430 --> 39:07.931
And you're going to make it right.

39:09.683 --> 39:10.726
Well, I'm trying.

39:14.855 --> 39:15.856
You will.

39:28.327 --> 39:31.997
Thank you for being here tonight.

39:33.707 --> 39:35.334
Nowhere else I'd rather be.

39:58.482 --> 40:01.068
-What's going on? You get my text?
-James confessed.

40:01.860 --> 40:05.656
The money, the amount.
The whole damn thing.

40:06.865 --> 40:07.866
What did you do?

40:08.867 --> 40:09.868
Does it matter?

40:09.952 --> 40:12.079
It does if he realizes what you're doing.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.373
He didn't. He won't.

40:15.207 --> 40:18.085
And now we have what we need
to put him away.

40:19.795 --> 40:22.464
And the best part is,
you can hear it yourself.

40:23.757 --> 40:24.758
You recorded him.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.261
What'd he say?

40:30.055 --> 40:33.433
I think there's something else
that's maybe more pressing.

40:46.238 --> 40:47.364
You sure you're ready?

40:48.323 --> 40:49.324
I am.

41:13.724 --> 41:15.559
-How are you?
-Good.

41:17.102 --> 41:18.187
Great, actually.

41:19.605 --> 41:20.606
How are you?

41:22.065 --> 41:23.442
To be honest with you…

41:24.276 --> 41:27.112
after our last session, I was concerned.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.323
Why?

41:29.406 --> 41:32.451
Well, for the first time
since you started your recovery,

41:32.534 --> 41:36.955
I feel like you might be
acting a little erratic.

41:38.123 --> 41:39.166
Excuse me?

41:39.833 --> 41:45.339
I've noticed you following
impulsive urges, testing boundaries.

41:45.923 --> 41:49.927
Maybe crossing lines that
you don't mean to cross in the process.

41:50.636 --> 41:53.597
And I know it's all coming
from a good place.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.266
Your search for your own sense of self.

41:57.726 --> 42:00.771
But it's not just about
who you were in the past,

42:01.605 --> 42:04.399
it's about the choices
that you're making now.

42:05.484 --> 42:08.070
What choices exactly are you referring to?

42:10.405 --> 42:12.491
I spoke to James this morning.

42:14.076 --> 42:16.286
-You what?
-He's your conservator.

42:17.287 --> 42:21.124
I was concerned about your interest
in experimental treatment.

42:22.125 --> 42:24.753
And James asked me to call the clinic.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.047
You had no right to do that.

42:27.130 --> 42:29.341
They told me you received treatment,

42:29.424 --> 42:33.929
which happened against
my professional medical advice.

42:34.638 --> 42:37.099
I let them know that
if they ever treat you again,

42:37.182 --> 42:40.477
I'll make sure
that their license is revoked.

42:43.605 --> 42:48.902
When I was in that clinic,
I finally started to recover things.

42:48.986 --> 42:51.071
Fragments, memories.

42:52.739 --> 42:55.325
You have no idea how it feels

42:55.409 --> 42:58.161
to not even have
the most basic knowledge of yourself.

42:58.245 --> 42:59.621
So tell me, Sophie.

43:00.581 --> 43:01.999
Tell me how it feels.

43:02.082 --> 43:04.751
I've been trying to tell you
for the past four months!

43:05.669 --> 43:09.214
-I thought you were on my side.
-I am on your side.

43:09.298 --> 43:11.091
Then why cut me off? What is it?

43:11.175 --> 43:13.302
Do you feel threatened
by me going somewhere else?

43:13.385 --> 43:17.890
I feel responsible for getting you
the help that you need.

43:20.934 --> 43:22.936
This is gonna be hard to take in.

43:24.438 --> 43:26.607
But I need you to listen.

43:30.319 --> 43:35.365
Experimental treatments have been
known to trigger psychotic episodes

43:35.449 --> 43:39.828
in people
who are biologically predisposed.

43:40.787 --> 43:42.122
What?

43:42.998 --> 43:48.670
Your mother was diagnosed
with a type of psychotic disorder.

43:50.756 --> 43:53.175
-What does that mean?
-We're not sure exactly.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.637
But it's likely that she might
have been paranoid,

43:56.720 --> 44:00.390
had delusions that people close to her
were trying to hurt her.

44:05.187 --> 44:06.939
You don't know anything about my mother.

44:07.564 --> 44:11.318
James filled out your medical
history when we first started.

44:13.403 --> 44:15.072
And you're just mentioning this now?

44:15.155 --> 44:20.202
It was crucial for you to form an identity
that wasn't clouded by past stigmas.

44:21.828 --> 44:25.874
The cluster of disorders under
which your mother's diagnosis falls,

44:26.375 --> 44:28.502
has a genetic component.

44:28.585 --> 44:31.171
So what are you saying?
I have what she had?

44:31.255 --> 44:36.134
I'm saying that the things that
that clinic offers--

44:36.218 --> 44:39.429
experimental treatments, hallucinogens--

44:39.513 --> 44:43.976
they can trigger a psychotic reaction
in people who are predisposed,

44:44.059 --> 44:45.811
and I don't know that you aren't.

44:45.894 --> 44:50.482
-Sophie, please don't leave.
-What are you gonna do? Call James?

44:50.566 --> 44:51.525
Sophie.

44:51.608 --> 44:54.194
You have no idea who he really is.
