00:05.216 --> 00:08.629
Welcome to the first meeting
of Stan's Book Club.

00:08.629 --> 00:10.431
Today's book is
Moby Dick.

00:10.431 --> 00:13.634
I had a whale
of a time reading it.

00:15.436 --> 00:17.558
That's what you do
in book clubs, right?

00:17.558 --> 00:19.350
Make terrible puns
about the book?

00:19.350 --> 00:20.641
I can't wait till next week

00:20.641 --> 00:23.354
when we'd read
The Wizard of Paws.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.196
Ah? Ah?

00:26.817 --> 00:29.450
Stan, you didn't tell me
Karl would be here.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.612
I thought it would
just be the two of us.

00:31.612 --> 00:34.034
Likewise.
And I also didn't think
we'd actually be

00:34.034 --> 00:35.286
discussing the book.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.658
Book clubs are
just for gossip.

00:37.658 --> 00:39.660
Guess which neighborhood
teen has been consuming

00:39.660 --> 00:41.122
his mother's
strength-training shakes

00:41.122 --> 00:43.254
and can now bench press
his own weight,

00:43.254 --> 00:45.666
from when he was seven?

00:45.666 --> 00:48.299
I know I didn't tell you
each the other would be here.

00:48.299 --> 00:49.840
But I want
you guys to get along

00:49.840 --> 00:51.672
because you're two
of the only people

00:51.672 --> 00:53.344
who know I can talk.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.346
And you have
so much in common.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.558
You're smart,
you love literature,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.980
and you both fart a little
when you're tickled.

00:59.980 --> 01:00.981
Come here.

01:00.981 --> 01:02.183
BOTH: No!

01:03.774 --> 01:05.396
Oh, wait.
I'm the tickle farter.

01:05.396 --> 01:06.237
Tickle me!

01:06.237 --> 01:07.528
BOTH: No!

01:09.029 --> 01:11.782
Stan, this whole thing
is misguided.

01:11.782 --> 01:14.155
We have nothing in common.

01:14.155 --> 01:18.038
Karl is a pompous buffoon
who names his sweater vests
after Greek gods.

01:18.038 --> 01:22.042
Demigods.
Only full sweaters
are named after gods.

01:22.042 --> 01:25.506
She's insufferable,
isn't she, Perseus?

01:25.506 --> 01:27.418
We have nothing in common.

01:27.418 --> 01:30.171
Nothing in common?
How can you say that?

01:30.171 --> 01:32.713
You're in the
same book club!

01:33.844 --> 01:35.636
As much as
I like you, Stan,

01:35.636 --> 01:37.768
this book club is
officially a bust.

01:37.768 --> 01:40.391
I'm going to go withdraw
to my sanctuary.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.563
I'm sorry, Stan,
but I'm leaving, too.

01:42.563 --> 01:45.186
Oh, and, Karl,
here's a tip.

01:45.186 --> 01:48.529
If your "sanctuary"
has mulch and shovels,

01:48.529 --> 01:51.152
it's probably more of a shed.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.325
You say "potato,"
I say "pommes aligot."

01:54.325 --> 01:57.037
Because you're common
and I enjoy French cuisine.

01:59.330 --> 02:02.413
Well, I guess it's just
you and me, Robert.

02:04.205 --> 02:06.417
So what did you
think of the book?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.918
You did read it,
didn't you?

02:07.918 --> 02:09.340
What?!

02:09.340 --> 02:10.421
The audiobook?

02:10.421 --> 02:12.513
Robert, that's abridged!

02:14.715 --> 02:18.058
STAN: So we never did
get to discuss Moby Dick.

02:18.058 --> 02:20.221
Is it weird that the
character in the book

02:20.221 --> 02:22.433
that I most related
to was the whale?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.204
Tyler, don't snack.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.585
You'll ruin your appetite
for dinner.

02:44.585 --> 02:46.046
Bennett,
back me up here.

02:50.341 --> 02:52.132
Listen to your mother.

02:54.094 --> 02:55.636
I want to quit dance.

02:55.636 --> 02:56.887
What do you mean?

02:56.887 --> 02:59.260
Your big recital's
coming up in a few days.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.262
You mean, I'm not gonna get
to sit through three hours

03:01.262 --> 03:02.723
of other kids dancing
just to see

03:02.723 --> 03:04.725
your two minute routine?

03:04.725 --> 03:07.187
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.690
No, no, Bennett.
Chloe can't quit dance now.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.732
I don't like dance anymore.

03:11.732 --> 03:13.524
I want to quit and learn
to do some awesome

03:13.524 --> 03:14.945
BMX bike tricks like Tyler.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.737
Chloe, all right.

03:16.737 --> 03:20.080
You're gonna look
so cool all scarred up.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.373
Tyler,
don't encourage her.

03:22.373 --> 03:24.785
Fine, I'll never encourage
my little sister again.

03:24.785 --> 03:26.917
I was hoping we'd be close.
But that's on you.

03:28.379 --> 03:30.331
Chloe, you can't
quit dance three days

03:30.331 --> 03:31.672
before the big recital.

03:31.672 --> 03:33.424
Back me up here, Bennett.

03:33.424 --> 03:34.545
Well--

03:36.757 --> 03:38.799
( seeds clatter in bowl )

04:15.586 --> 04:17.338
Sweetie, come here.

04:17.338 --> 04:19.880
Listen, we've already paid
for the classes,

04:19.880 --> 04:22.012
the costumes,
the recital tickets,

04:22.012 --> 04:23.384
pre-ordered the DVD.

04:23.384 --> 04:25.015
You got to finish
what you start.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.557
Mommy quit
that cooking class.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.849
And if you start a grease
fire while dancing,

04:28.849 --> 04:30.311
you can quit, too.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.233
You never let me do anything.

04:33.233 --> 04:35.856
You said I can't do BMX,
you said I can't be a lion tamer

04:35.856 --> 04:37.197
at the circus
when I grow up.

04:37.197 --> 04:39.950
Lion tamer is even
more dangerous than BMX.

04:39.950 --> 04:41.612
I've thought
it all out, Mommy.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.364
If things go bad
with the lion,

04:43.364 --> 04:45.536
I'll just push a clown
in front of me and run.

04:46.617 --> 04:48.999
You can't outrun a lion.

04:48.999 --> 04:52.042
I don't have to outrun a lion,
I just have to outrun the clown.

04:56.006 --> 04:57.758
Go and get it.
(laughs)

04:57.758 --> 04:59.219
Knockedy-knockedy.

04:59.219 --> 05:01.682
What do you want, Karl?

05:01.682 --> 05:05.346
I came to apologize
for being so irascible
at the book club.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.478
The truth is,
I respect you a great deal.

05:07.478 --> 05:10.060
I don't know
why we so often butt heads.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.311
I respect you, too.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.354
Mainly because
we're the only two kids I know

05:13.354 --> 05:15.235
who wouldn't make some
juvenile joke off the fact

05:15.235 --> 05:17.277
that you just said
"butt heads."

05:17.277 --> 05:20.030
And yet you've managed to make
a joke in the very process

05:20.030 --> 05:21.402
of denying
that you were doing so.

05:21.402 --> 05:22.653
Well played.

05:23.944 --> 05:25.075
Thank you, Karl.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.948
I knew you two
would come together.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.873
Well, maybe
I should get going.

05:32.873 --> 05:35.295
Or...you can stay.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.258
( romantic music playing )

05:38.258 --> 05:42.673
♪ Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... ♪

05:42.673 --> 05:45.055
The music is nice.

05:45.055 --> 05:47.347
Yes, it is.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.736
Ahh!

05:55.736 --> 05:57.277
Ahh!

05:59.820 --> 06:02.322
I just had the most
horrible nightmare.

06:02.322 --> 06:05.245
I was about to...kiss Karl Fink.

06:05.245 --> 06:06.196
This is your fault

06:06.196 --> 06:08.328
for trying to push us
together, Stan.

06:08.328 --> 06:10.751
Hey, I just wanted
you two to be friends.

06:10.751 --> 06:13.373
You're the one who's getting
all freaky with it.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.802
Hey, Tyler.

06:21.802 --> 06:23.504
I want to practice some
BMX tricks after my dance class.

06:23.504 --> 06:25.005
Will you help me?

06:25.005 --> 06:26.927
Chloe, you heard
what Mom and Dad said.

06:26.927 --> 06:28.719
If I help you,
I'll get in trouble.

06:28.719 --> 06:29.850
When did we switch places

06:29.850 --> 06:31.562
and you became
the cute little girl?

06:33.223 --> 06:35.976
Chloe, I'm old enough now
that I'm not gonna give in

06:35.976 --> 06:37.568
to peer pressure
and be made to do

06:37.568 --> 06:38.899
something I know is wrong.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.320
I'm not in your peer group.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.322
Good point.
Let's do it.

06:42.322 --> 06:44.525
But we're gonna
have to keep this a secret

06:44.525 --> 06:45.576
from Mom and Dad.

06:45.576 --> 06:47.197
I'm good at keeping secrets.

06:47.197 --> 06:49.490
I kept the secret that I have
mice in my sock drawer.

06:49.490 --> 06:51.161
( Ellen screaming )

06:51.161 --> 06:52.743
Sometimes they get out.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.210
Dad, I didn't sleep
well last night.

07:00.210 --> 07:03.303
Were you up again writing
presidential fan fiction?

07:03.303 --> 07:05.425
I just think James Buchanan
and Edgar Allan Poe

07:05.425 --> 07:07.307
could've solved
a lot of crimes together.

07:08.849 --> 07:10.050
But this is different.

07:10.050 --> 07:11.932
I didn't sleep
well last night

07:11.932 --> 07:15.055
because I had
a very disturbing dream.

07:15.055 --> 07:16.266
As a psychologist, you know

07:16.266 --> 07:18.018
about dream
interpretation, right?

07:18.018 --> 07:19.399
I know a thing
or two about it.

07:19.399 --> 07:22.613
A thing or two,
or are you an expert?

07:22.613 --> 07:24.234
Sorry, I'm tired.

07:24.234 --> 07:26.276
I didn't mean
to sound like Count Dracula.

07:26.276 --> 07:29.409
You'll get that when you
read my latest installment.

07:29.409 --> 07:32.202
Buchanan and Poe
have their hands full.

07:33.574 --> 07:35.876
Yes, I am an expert.

07:35.876 --> 07:39.419
In fact, maybe I'll write
some psychology fan fiction

07:39.419 --> 07:44.214
featuring me and Sigmund Freud
solving crimes of the mind.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.218
Fun. Don't.

07:50.260 --> 07:53.013
So tell me
about this dream.

07:53.013 --> 07:55.305
Well, without going
into the specifics,

07:55.305 --> 07:57.518
it was a dream in which
I started to do something

07:57.518 --> 08:01.231
that I would never
in a million years
really want to do.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.564
Like swimming the butterfly
through an open sewer

08:03.564 --> 08:06.486
or talking to my dad
about something personal.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.238
So what does that mean?

08:08.238 --> 08:11.281
It may very well be
your subconscious

08:11.281 --> 08:13.493
telling you that you do want
to do this thing.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.576
Really? I see.

08:16.577 --> 08:18.709
( silent scream )

08:21.291 --> 08:23.083
Or it could be
the exact opposite.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.175
Dreams are weird that way.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.798
Like when I dreamed
I was an Olympic gymnast

08:27.798 --> 08:29.890
and I finished third
on the pommel horse

08:29.890 --> 08:32.222
and my Bulgarian
shot-putting girlfriend

08:32.222 --> 08:34.474
breaks up with me for a guy
who didn't even medal.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.346
Didn't even medal!

08:37.938 --> 08:40.310
Avery?

08:40.310 --> 08:41.602
Avery!

08:42.693 --> 08:45.195
I know it was just a dream,

08:45.195 --> 08:47.447
but I wonder...

08:51.241 --> 08:53.153
Go for the gold, Bennett!

08:53.153 --> 08:55.115
Go for the gold!

08:55.115 --> 08:56.366
Huh! Oh--

08:56.366 --> 08:58.869
Oh--oh--oh!

08:58.869 --> 09:01.291
I got it!
I did it!

09:01.291 --> 09:02.332
I did it!

09:02.332 --> 09:03.834
No, I didn't.

09:09.630 --> 09:12.432
No wonder Svetlana
broke up with you.

09:19.099 --> 09:21.311
I'm ready for my first
BMX lesson, Tyler.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.024
What are you wearing?
My dance recital costume.

09:24.024 --> 09:25.776
I'm a BMX princess.

09:25.776 --> 09:27.818
Sure, why not.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.240
They should make an
animated movie about me.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.952
I'll sing this song.

09:31.952 --> 09:33.153
♪ Ride the bike ♪

09:33.153 --> 09:34.404
♪ Ride the bike ♪

09:34.404 --> 09:38.408
♪ There'll be no stopping me ♪

09:38.408 --> 09:40.290
♪ Ride the bike ♪

09:40.290 --> 09:41.331
♪ Ride the bike ♪

09:41.331 --> 09:45.545
♪ While my princess
dress flows free ♪♪

09:45.545 --> 09:47.467
Probably win an Oscar.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.761
Sure, why not.

09:50.761 --> 09:53.173
Now let's get you up
to the top of the ramp.

09:53.173 --> 09:55.345
Wow, you put
that together all by yourself?

09:55.345 --> 09:57.387
Are we even allowed
to do this here?

09:57.387 --> 09:58.849
Sure, why not.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.183
Safety is
very important, Chloe.

10:03.183 --> 10:05.936
So before you do any riding,
we are going to discuss

10:05.936 --> 10:07.858
exactly what's gonna happen,

10:07.858 --> 10:10.230
and then we're gonna walk
through it a few times slowly

10:10.230 --> 10:11.531
so you can get
the feel of what it's like--

10:11.531 --> 10:13.363
Y.O.L.O.!!!

10:15.946 --> 10:17.658
( crashing )

10:19.409 --> 10:22.622
That was awesome!

10:22.622 --> 10:24.084
Chloe, your dress!

10:26.206 --> 10:28.338
Tyler, why didn't we walk
through it a few times

10:28.338 --> 10:30.550
slowly so I could
get the feel of it?

10:36.346 --> 10:39.639
Hey, Karl. What's up?
Plotting world domination?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.602
Oh, please.
Dominating Pasadena
will more than suffice.

10:42.602 --> 10:44.224
There are whole swaths
of the world

10:44.224 --> 10:46.356
that are just nothing
but headaches.

10:46.356 --> 10:48.358
Hello, Stan.

10:48.358 --> 10:52.072
Hey Karl. Did you see my plans
for a cat teleportation device?

10:52.072 --> 10:54.865
It's just an X with a large rock
hanging over it.

10:54.865 --> 10:56.366
Shh.

10:56.366 --> 10:58.278
The cats don't know that.

10:59.780 --> 11:01.621
So anyway,
here's the thing.

11:01.621 --> 11:03.834
I had this weird dream,

11:03.834 --> 11:06.456
and I was thinking
that we should talk about it.

11:06.456 --> 11:09.880
But now that I'm here,
I realize it's just one dream,
no big deal. Right?

11:09.880 --> 11:11.922
Quite possibly.
It could mean nothing.

11:14.094 --> 11:15.505
Or it could mean this...

11:16.636 --> 11:18.178
( romantic music playing )

11:18.178 --> 11:21.681
♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... ♪

11:24.765 --> 11:26.356
Ahh!

11:26.356 --> 11:29.359
Ahh!
Karl, stop licking my hand!

11:30.731 --> 11:32.402
Ahh!

11:35.615 --> 11:37.117
Stan!

11:37.117 --> 11:38.318
You can't eat ribs
for dinner

11:38.318 --> 11:40.911
and expect this not to happen.

11:42.492 --> 11:45.375
No, I had
the nightmare again.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.247
Having the dream once
could've been a fluke.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.379
But this is a pattern.

11:49.379 --> 11:50.420
What if my dad's right?

11:50.420 --> 11:53.754
What if it does represent
a subconscious desire?

11:53.754 --> 11:57.097
I had a dream once that
I ate a giant marshmallow,

11:57.097 --> 11:58.138
and when I woke up--

11:58.138 --> 11:59.890
Don't tell me.
The pillow was gone.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.342
No. Chloe was gone.

12:03.393 --> 12:04.434
Then she came back in.

12:04.434 --> 12:05.645
With marshmallows.

12:05.645 --> 12:07.347
But they were just
regular size.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.811
Look, I know
you're trying to cheer me up,

12:10.811 --> 12:12.312
but I'm freaking out.

12:12.312 --> 12:14.524
Maybe you should talk
to Karl and see

12:14.524 --> 12:16.406
if it's really what you want.

12:16.406 --> 12:17.357
At least you'll know.

12:17.357 --> 12:19.409
No! I can't do that.

12:19.409 --> 12:21.822
I can never say
anything to him about this.

12:21.822 --> 12:22.953
And you have to promise

12:22.953 --> 12:25.165
not to say anything
to him either.

12:25.165 --> 12:29.579
Is it possible
that I...like Karl Fink?

12:29.579 --> 12:31.211
( retches )

12:31.211 --> 12:33.293
Avery, either
throw up or don't,

12:33.293 --> 12:35.335
but don't tease me like that.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.341
Hey, Karl.

12:41.341 --> 12:43.223
What's up?

12:43.223 --> 12:45.185
Not that something
has to be up.

12:45.185 --> 12:47.767
Nothing's up.
Stop grilling me!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.729
You're acting weird.

12:49.729 --> 12:52.192
Well, I mean, weirder than
normal for a talking dog.

12:52.192 --> 12:54.945
Well, if anyone knows
"weird," it's you, right?

12:54.945 --> 12:57.027
I love the way you say
"It's not weird."

12:57.027 --> 12:58.778
Do that.
Do that for me now.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.320
Say "It's not weird."

13:01.361 --> 13:03.613
I suppose I may say
that on occasion,

13:03.613 --> 13:06.036
but it's a perfectly
acceptable turn of phrase.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.787
It's not weird.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.000
Ah, you said it!

13:10.000 --> 13:12.462
I love when you say that!

13:12.462 --> 13:14.584
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

13:14.584 --> 13:18.048
Is it hot in here?
Stop grilling me!!!

13:18.048 --> 13:21.011
Stan, you're obviously
uncomfortable about something,

13:21.011 --> 13:24.264
and I'm assuming there's
a reason you came over here,
so what is it?

13:24.264 --> 13:29.229
Not a secret I promised to keep
that Avery dreamed about kissing
you, that's for sure.

13:29.229 --> 13:31.601
Dang it!

13:31.601 --> 13:34.774
How do you successfully
keep the secret
that you can talk?

13:34.774 --> 13:36.436
I have no idea.

13:43.033 --> 13:45.075
Chloe, your recital
is tomorrow.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.497
Why didn't you ask Avery
to fix the costume
like we talked about?

13:47.497 --> 13:49.709
I did.
She said she can't fix it.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.122
I can't fix it.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.004
What do you mean,
she can't fix it?

13:54.004 --> 13:56.256
She's a whiz with sewing.
She's doing this
whole fashion thing.

13:56.256 --> 13:57.717
I may be a whiz with sewing

13:57.717 --> 13:59.459
and doing this
whole fashion thing,

13:59.459 --> 14:01.221
but the fabric is ruined.

14:01.221 --> 14:02.672
Can't she get more fabric?

14:02.672 --> 14:05.425
No.

14:05.425 --> 14:07.767
But there has to be something
that she can do.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.930
There's nothing
Avery can do, Chloe.

14:09.930 --> 14:12.232
And it's late.
She's already asleep.

14:12.232 --> 14:14.975
Now if you'll excuse me,
Avery had ribs for dinner

14:14.975 --> 14:17.317
and there's something
very important I have to do.

14:22.402 --> 14:23.904
Go to bed and wait.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.367
I'll get to you later,
Chicken Fingers.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.450
We are gonna be
in such huge trouble
when Mom and Dad see this.

14:30.450 --> 14:33.493
Well, the recital's
not until tomorrow.

14:33.493 --> 14:36.376
Maybe something magical
will happen to get us
out of this.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.419
Chloe, be realistic.
Nothing magical
ever happens to us.

14:39.419 --> 14:41.671
Hey, guys.
What's up?
Stan, we're busy.

14:41.671 --> 14:44.214
We don't have time
for our talking dog right now.

14:45.305 --> 14:46.886
BENNETT: Chloe?

14:48.678 --> 14:50.310
Chloe, go put on
your recital costume.

14:50.310 --> 14:51.721
We're going to
take some pictures.

14:51.721 --> 14:52.892
Now?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.684
The recital's
not until tomorrow.

14:54.684 --> 14:56.776
Yeah, but the pictures
never turn out at the recital

14:56.776 --> 14:58.478
because they won't
let you use the flash.

14:58.478 --> 14:59.729
What do you mean?

14:59.729 --> 15:02.943
I look so cute in this photo
from last year.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.195
Chloe, put on your costume.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.526
Where is the good camera?

15:06.526 --> 15:07.988
I think
it's in your office.

15:07.988 --> 15:09.449
Remember, we set it up
on the timer

15:09.449 --> 15:12.292
to take that picture of me
using the Force on you?

15:12.292 --> 15:13.954
( beeping )

15:13.954 --> 15:14.995
Now!

15:17.958 --> 15:19.379
We'll go get the camera.

15:19.379 --> 15:21.041
Chloe,
get your costume on.

15:23.383 --> 15:25.045
Whew, that was close.

15:25.045 --> 15:27.217
They almost caught me
and Robert having a little fun

15:27.217 --> 15:28.428
with their camera.

15:32.352 --> 15:33.813
Knockedy--

15:33.813 --> 15:36.316
Please don't say
"knockedy" again.

15:36.316 --> 15:38.608
All right, I won't.

15:41.401 --> 15:43.563
All right, I can't say just
one and leave it hanging.
"Knockedy."

15:43.563 --> 15:46.276
Ha. There.
Isn't that better?

15:46.276 --> 15:50.200
Karl, you are the last person
I want to see right now.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.782
Avery, Stan told me.

15:52.782 --> 15:54.454
He told you?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.626
And if this is something
that's haunting your dreams,

15:56.626 --> 15:59.079
perhaps it's something
that we should explore.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.382
Perhaps it is.

is glued to your shoulder.

I said don't freak out.

if I push my hand off.

16:43.293 --> 16:46.086

to my head, didn't you?

17:00.060 --> 17:01.271

move out of the way.

So proud.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.702
That is so sweet.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.785
Okay, now, Tyler,
get out of the way.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.207
I want to get
some of her dancing.

17:18.578 --> 17:22.582
Or some of us
dancing together.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.374
Yeah. Whoo.

17:25.215 --> 17:26.296
Ow!

17:26.296 --> 17:29.129
I mean, yay!

17:29.129 --> 17:31.341
Kids, what is
going on here?

17:31.341 --> 17:32.972
You know
how you always say

17:32.972 --> 17:36.766
that brothers and sisters
should stick together?

17:38.518 --> 17:40.770
Okay, here's your punishment.

17:40.770 --> 17:43.483
We called the dance studio
and there are no more costumes

17:43.483 --> 17:45.185
for the princess number.

17:45.185 --> 17:48.778
But they do have extras
for the tin soldier dance.

17:48.778 --> 17:50.570
With the kindergarteners.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.117
Take it from me, kids.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.409
You don't want to go
behind your parents' back.

17:59.409 --> 18:00.790
I've been down that road.

18:03.163 --> 18:04.664
And the choreography
doesn't work

18:04.664 --> 18:05.915
with an odd number of girls.

18:05.915 --> 18:08.087
So your punishment,
Tyler, is...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.209
( gasps )

18:22.982 --> 18:24.644
Mom, I need some advice.

18:24.644 --> 18:26.816
Of course. Sit.

18:26.816 --> 18:29.569
We'll have cheesecake
as I share my experiences,

18:29.569 --> 18:31.231
my wisdom, my love.

18:31.231 --> 18:33.823
I live for these moments
when you come to me like this.

18:33.823 --> 18:36.366
And I might do it more
if you didn't make

18:36.366 --> 18:38.868
such a big deal out of it.

18:43.203 --> 18:45.915
So what's happenin'?
Let's chat. Break it down.

18:47.297 --> 18:48.798
When you were younger,

18:48.798 --> 18:50.710
was there ever a boy
you thought you didn't like,

18:50.710 --> 18:52.802
but maybe you really did,
but you just didn't know it?

18:52.802 --> 18:55.675
What is some boy
telling you?

18:55.675 --> 18:58.428
No, no, no,
no one's telling me anything.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.310
I just might be confused.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.562
When you met Dad,
how did you know you liked him?

19:02.562 --> 19:04.764
Well, I didn't know at first.

19:04.764 --> 19:07.317
Not until the night
of our first kiss.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.319
He put his hand on my cheek.

19:09.319 --> 19:11.691
I put my hand
on his shoulder.

19:11.691 --> 19:16.276
And as I closed my eyes,
even before we kissed, I knew.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.699
Wow. That's really romantic.

19:19.699 --> 19:21.331
Thanks, Mom.

19:21.331 --> 19:23.243
Any time. No big.
It's all good.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.457
I did not just
advise you to kiss a boy.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.458
I knew before the kiss!

19:28.458 --> 19:29.789
No kiss!
No kiss!

19:33.753 --> 19:34.924
Thanks for coming.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.926
I got your text
that you needed to see me.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.218
I think I know why.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.759
Stan told me
about your dream.

19:39.759 --> 19:42.302
He told you about the kissing
and the hand licking?

19:42.302 --> 19:44.894
What hand licking?
Hand licking?
I never said hand licking.

19:44.894 --> 19:47.397
I wasn't getting
all freaky with it.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.190
Ohh, this is so humiliating.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.312
For both of us.

19:52.312 --> 19:54.113
After Stan planted
the idea in my head,

19:54.113 --> 19:55.905
I had the same dream.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.907
Only without your
freaky hand licking.

19:59.909 --> 20:03.323
Wait. How do we know
this isn't a dream?

20:03.323 --> 20:05.285
There's only one way
to find out.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.957
Aaah!
Aaah!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.208
It's not a dream.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.501
Your fingers are
like little vices!

20:13.503 --> 20:15.925
You know,
we'll never get past this

20:15.925 --> 20:18.177
if we don't explore
whether or not

20:18.177 --> 20:21.341
there's any real feelings here.

20:21.341 --> 20:23.303

20:40.360 --> 20:41.451

feed me table scraps

21:31.581 --> 21:33.753
is real, real, real...

21:33.753 --> 21:35.044
So keep doing that.

21:37.216 --> 21:39.879
STAN: Well, Avery and Karl
never did kiss.

21:39.879 --> 21:42.762
But I hope the whole thing
brings them closer together.

21:42.762 --> 21:45.264
Speaking of getting
closer together...

21:47.136 --> 21:49.849
Kinda lonely in the house
tonight, isn't it, Stan?

21:49.849 --> 21:51.351
Just you and me.

21:52.982 --> 21:54.644
( romantic music playing )

21:54.644 --> 21:57.567
♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... ♪

21:59.939 --> 22:01.571
Ahh!!!

22:04.654 --> 22:05.655
