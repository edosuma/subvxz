What did they do to us?

'No, please don't do this!‘

00:07.300 --> 00:10.167
"One month ago,
my friends were kidnapped

00:18.810 --> 00:19.742
It's coming from underground.

[coughing]

00:26.190 --> 00:27.452
What's your name?

00:27.490 --> 00:29.424
- I'm Sara Harvey.
- We know who it is.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.052
It's Andrew, babe.

00:31.090 --> 00:32.694
And we're gonna get him.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.399
They're all anagrams.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.067
For Charles DiLaurentis.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.260
Some of those toys
in Ali's room were hers

00:42.310 --> 00:43.538
'but some of them were his.'

00:43.570 --> 00:45.629
Who is Charles DiLaurentis?

00:50.450 --> 00:51.439
(Aria)
'Where is Mona?‘

00:51.480 --> 00:52.845
She's down the hall.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.179
And that other girl
is down there too, Sara Harvey.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.040
What about Andrew?

00:58.750 --> 01:00.081
What about him?

01:02.330 --> 01:05.288
I heard them talking
in my ambulance..

01:05.330 --> 01:08.857
...about how they found plans
and journals in Andrew's house

01:08.900 --> 01:10.720
at the farm
where he left the van.

01:12.540 --> 01:16.761
Andrew Campbell and Charles
DiLaurentis are the same person.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.505
That's what we're saying, right?

01:18.540 --> 01:20.633
We're not just saying it,
it's reality.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.444
Reality's been through a lot,
and so have we.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.210
You guys, it makes
perfect sense.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.842
'Andrew's always just been
there on the edge of things.‘

01:27.880 --> 01:29.882
'Always there, helping.‘

01:29.920 --> 01:32.309
Makes me sick
just thinking about it.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.215
So when do we tell
the police about Charles?

01:35.260 --> 01:37.751
- We don't.
- We don't?

01:37.790 --> 01:39.451
The cops will know
if it's true.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.728
It is true, Spencer.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.852
They'll know Andrew is Charles

01:41.900 --> 01:43.162
when they find him.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.239
[grunting]

01:50.510 --> 01:52.603
Jeez, Toby.
Listen to me.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.777
[grunts]

01:55.780 --> 01:57.748
Give me five minutes.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.146
- Walk away!
- Not gonna happen.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.416
Do your job.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.681
You have the right
to remain silent.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.779
Anything you say
can and will be used

02:09.830 --> 02:12.492
'against you in a court of law.'

02:12.530 --> 02:13.758
* Got a secret

02:13.800 --> 02:14.926
* Can you keep it

02:14.960 --> 02:17.622
* Swear this one you'll save

02:17.670 --> 02:20.161
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:20.200 --> 02:22.703
* Takin' this one to the grave

02:22.740 --> 02:24.833
* If I show you
that I know you *

02:24.870 --> 02:27.703
* Won't tell what I said

02:27.740 --> 02:30.174
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

02:30.210 --> 02:32.713
* If one of them is dead *

02:35.620 --> 02:37.417
You had no right to put yourself
in that much danger.

02:37.450 --> 02:38.712
I wanted to help.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.559
I did help.
We saved them.

02:40.590 --> 02:42.421
You had no obligation.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.325
Yes, I did.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.691
[sighs]

02:47.730 --> 02:48.890
It's over.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.190
They'll catch
that pervert Campbell

02:54.240 --> 02:55.696
and that'll be
the end of it.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.733
It's been a very long day.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.736
The important thing
is you're safe.

03:03.610 --> 03:04.747
Maybe.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.212
Who is Charles DiLaurentis?

03:10.850 --> 03:12.681
What?

03:12.720 --> 03:15.416
Not what, who?

03:15.460 --> 03:18.281
Someone asked me
about Charles DiLaurentis.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.753
And I didn't recognize
the name.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.496
Do we have a Charles DiLaurentis
In our family?

03:23.530 --> 03:24.963
No.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.729
No one..

03:26.770 --> 03:29.568
...ever?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.204
No Charles DiLaurentis
in this family.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.498
Well, then I guess
that person made a mistake.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.757
I'm not asleep.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.599
Hi.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.756
Hi.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.291
Who are you?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.867
I'm Emily.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.868
You're Emily?

04:01.900 --> 04:03.333
You were down there.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.860
Yeah.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.229
With my friends.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.477
Have you talked
to your parents?

04:11.510 --> 04:13.341
Just my mother.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.610
We talked on the phone.

04:15.650 --> 04:16.787
She cried.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.919
How did you end up there?

04:24.460 --> 04:25.586
I ran away.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.297
'I was...in a parking lot
near Rosewood.‘

04:33.070 --> 04:35.891
I hit my head.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.864
Or someone hit me on the head.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.541
'Then I was down there.‘

04:44.450 --> 04:47.669
Then I thought, we||..

04:47.720 --> 04:49.881
...now you know what happens
to bad little girls.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.781
Did you see
who grabbed you?

04:53.820 --> 04:56.084
Did you hear his voice?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.428
I'm tired.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.567
[sighs]

05:05.130 --> 05:07.394
We got the son-of-a-bitch.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.566
Andrew.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.000
You caught him?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.803
We tracked him
all over Tyler Park

05:12.840 --> 05:14.603
finally flushed him out.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.403
Are you sure he's the one?

05:16.450 --> 05:17.747
We've been chasing him
since we found

05:17.780 --> 05:19.475
the prison van
at his uncle's farm.

05:20.850 --> 05:23.819
They traced all that
electronic gear to him.

05:23.850 --> 05:26.410
They found a journal
about how he hated Mona

05:26.460 --> 05:28.815
and how he thought Alison
and the rest of you represented

05:28.860 --> 05:31.579
the "Feminization of society."

05:31.630 --> 05:33.495
It was a regular manifesto.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.851
- Has he confessed?
- Not yet.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.027
If he's smart, he will.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.765
This town doesn't need
another trial.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.358
No, it doesn't.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.038
I'll let you get
back to sleep.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.570
I was asleep.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.907
Actual, real sleep.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.613
I haven't had that
In a long tIme.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.587
We never gave up.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.555
[instrumental music]

06:12.770 --> 06:14.169
I'm alright.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.531
Really.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.479
No, I understand.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.432
The army isn't nine to five.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.638
Do you wanna talk to mom again?

06:27.050 --> 06:28.870
Okay. Love you.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.046
Bye.

06:31.050 --> 06:32.039
He'll talk to you tonight.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.412
Let's get outta here.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.758
I just wanted to stop
in Sara's room and say goodbye.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.052
Well, she's gone, honey.

06:39.090 --> 06:40.193
I saw her leaving
with her mother

06:40.230 --> 06:42.152
when I got off
the elevator.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.519
Her mom came for her?

06:43.570 --> 06:44.798
I'm assuming
it was her mother.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.866
I didn't really talk to 'em.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.778
[sighs]

06:52.810 --> 06:54.175
You know, the police
said that Sara

06:54.210 --> 06:55.837
had been down there
for over two years.

07:04.990 --> 07:06.582
[sighs]

07:06.620 --> 07:07.757
It's okay now.

07:10.830 --> 07:11.956
[sighs]

07:17.500 --> 07:18.626
[intense music]

07:22.610 --> 07:24.908
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

07:31.510 --> 07:34.547
Think about what you want
for dinner and I'll order.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.548
Anything, as long
as it's delivery.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.945
I'm not leaving you alone.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.116
Okay.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.869
[instrumental music]

08:19.900 --> 08:22.869
There are a lot of these.

08:22.900 --> 08:27.132
Yeah, it's mostly antibiotics
and supplements, and..

08:27.170 --> 08:28.899
...something in case
I feel anxious.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.801
Can't imagine
why I'd need that.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.540
Too early for sarcasm?

08:36.580 --> 08:37.979
Not where I come from.

08:45.820 --> 08:48.084
I thought I'd stay
for a couple nights.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.827
Yeah, it would be good.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.158
Your father is dealing
with the police.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.294
He's talked to all the other
parents and we've all agreed

08:56.330 --> 08:59.788
that no one has to talk to the
po|Ice untII you guys are ready.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.068
I'm ready.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.704
- I'll do it today.
- No, you won't.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.765
Mom, I wanna make sure
that Andrew doesn't get out.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.335
- There's time for that.
- I-I-I don't wanna wait.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.076
He's not gonna hurt me
or anybody else ever again.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.873
I will make sure of that.

09:15.020 --> 09:18.649
Why don't you come downstairs?
Help me make some tea.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.817
Yeah, I will in a minute.

09:20.860 --> 09:21.986
Okay.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.695
[instrumental music]

09:41.240 --> 09:44.073
I spoke to my friend
in the prosecutor's office.

09:44.110 --> 09:45.805
There's little chance
of Mona being charged

09:45.850 --> 09:48.717
for faking her death
and causing Alison's arrest.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.389
'They'd just as soon blame
everything on the Campbell boy.'

09:51.420 --> 09:52.978
'Nice and tidy.‘

09:53.020 --> 09:55.079
Something's wrong.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.621
They made a mistake
at the hospital.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.685
They left out one of
my prescriptions.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.288
They're supposed to give me
an anti-anxiety medication

10:00.330 --> 10:01.627
to help me sleep.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.797
I asked them not to.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.223
You asked them not to?

10:05.270 --> 10:07.295
Spencer, you know
you've had some issues.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.365
Mom, they-they gave me
something at the hospital

10:09.400 --> 10:11.231
and it was the first night
in forever that I got

10:11.270 --> 10:13.704
what a normal person
would call sleep.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.298
Honey, you're home now.
You're not in the hospital.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.978
I can't believe
that you did this.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.409
It wasn't an easy decision.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.714
Okay, that makes me feel
a lot better.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.786
I will help you any way I can,
but I'm not gonna take

10:22.820 --> 10:24.378
the chance of you
having another problem.

10:24.420 --> 10:28.254
- Mom, I need that prescription.
- No, you want it.

10:28.290 --> 10:29.723
- There's a difference.
- That's semantics.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.022
That's the rule.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.652
'I'm sorry
if that sounds unfair'

10:32.700 --> 10:34.827
but I have to be firm
on this and so do you.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.258
Wow.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.302
I really am back home.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.345
* Walking shadows

10:54.380 --> 10:58.146

10:58.190 --> 11:02.308

11:04.830 --> 11:08.823
* I felt the tight rope break

11:08.860 --> 11:12.364
* Snap beneath my step

11:12.400 --> 11:17.667
* I'm still walking
out in thin air *

11:19.410 --> 11:23.107
* Whenever I go

11:23.150 --> 11:26.369
* Will I go far

11:26.410 --> 11:28.719
* However I go

11:28.750 --> 11:31.082
* Oh I know

there's no such person

as Charles DiLaurentis
In our famIIy.

13:16.490 --> 13:19.948
Ali, I'm gonna say
this is delicately as I can.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.195
Your father's a liar.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.219
That was the delicate way?

13:23.270 --> 13:24.362
He didn't say, let me think

13:24.400 --> 13:25.958
or ask you where
you heard the name

13:26.000 --> 13:29.037
or who asked about it,
he just shut you down. Why?

13:29.070 --> 13:31.038
I suppose you wanna go
the police about this.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.332
No. Not really.

13:32.370 --> 13:33.576
I don't wanna walk
In to any more

13:33.610 --> 13:35.305
police stations
with any more theories.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.342
- Let the cops figure it out.
- Figure what out?

13:37.380 --> 13:39.371
That I'm somehow related
to someone named

13:39.410 --> 13:42.072
Charles DiLaurentis who really
is Andrew Campbell?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.519
What do you think happened?

13:43.550 --> 13:45.108
The goblin snuck
into the Campbell house

13:45.150 --> 13:46.481
and switched babies on them?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.181
We both know that there are
more conventIonal ways

13:48.220 --> 13:50.222
somebody can end up
with more than two parents.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.228
That's how you and I got
to share a brother.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.965
[instrumental music]

14:05.410 --> 14:06.536
Thank you.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.174
For getting us out
of that place.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.413
You'd have done
the same for me.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.339
(Ezra)
'Do you need a warm-up or..'

14:19.390 --> 14:20.516
Oh, sorry.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.287
No, no, it's-it's fine.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.025
It's just, um..

14:27.600 --> 14:28.953
The coffee's great.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.491
Okay.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.293
Um, maybe some company.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.407
* Make you feel safe..

14:42.540 --> 14:45.043
Did I remember to thank you
for saving my life?

14:45.080 --> 14:47.378
You did. Verbally.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.512
I'm still waiting for that

14:48.550 --> 14:49.983
thank you card
in the mail though.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.989
Yeah, I'm still just looking
for the right one.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.317
Something with
kittens on it.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.486
[chuckles]

14:59.560 --> 15:01.551
I was only in that place
for a few minutes.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.465
You were there
a lot longer.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.996
So this may seem like
a overly simplistic question

15:09.040 --> 15:11.235
but are you alright?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.899
I will be.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.474
Just remember
to check in with yourself.

15:18.510 --> 15:20.273
'You have an advantage over
most people, 'cause you can'

15:20.320 --> 15:22.208
write about it,
you can put it down on paper.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.945
I won't be doing that.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.550
Oh, no. No, I don't mean
for public consumption.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.319
A journal,
just for yourself--

15:28.360 --> 15:30.180
I just said,
I don't wanna do that.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.186
'I don't wanna own it,
I don't wanna memorialize it.'

15:32.230 --> 15:33.595
I don't wanna think
about it being in a diary

15:33.630 --> 15:35.291
somewhere in my room.

15:35.330 --> 15:38.322
I want a nice, big wall
between before and after.

[gunshots]

16:09.530 --> 16:11.361
I thought you liked
this wallpaper.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.630
I did.
But now I don't.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.629
Okay. Well, we'll take off
the wallpaper.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.729
Did you figured out
what you might want instead?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.773
I'll pick something out later,
I just want all this gone.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.744
You'll pick something later?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.145
What is wrong with you?

16:26.180 --> 16:28.011
Hanna, I've watched you
spend 30 minutes

16:28.050 --> 16:29.472
sorting fabric swatches.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.784
Don't you at least wanna
look at some paint chips

16:31.820 --> 16:33.151
see what you might want?

16:33.190 --> 16:34.316
No.

16:39.590 --> 16:40.727
Hey.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.227
Are you okay?

16:43.270 --> 16:45.761
I just wanna change my room,
and I wanna change it now.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.064
Not just the wallpaper,
everything.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.378
Hanna, when you were
in that silo..

16:53.410 --> 16:54.399
...your room down there..

16:54.440 --> 16:55.429
That was not my room!

16:55.480 --> 16:57.368
This is my room.

16:57.410 --> 16:59.776
Are you gonna help me or not?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.574
- I'll do anything you want.
- Then help me with the steamer.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.652
Hey, congratulate me,
I'm a renter.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.510
Ah.
You got that apartment?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.824
No more sleeping
on Mrs. Granville's couch.

17:11.860 --> 17:14.055
Nice, civic-minded lady,
but those Hummel figurines

17:14.100 --> 17:15.795
kept staring at me.

17:15.830 --> 17:16.751
Toby?

17:18.170 --> 17:20.559
I saw you,
I just wanted check in.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.307
We haven't spoken
since the other night.

17:23.340 --> 17:24.364
Been busy.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.729
Hello.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.475
Hi.

17:30.510 --> 17:33.149
Uh, Alison, this is my new
partner, Lorenzo Calderon.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.717
Lorenzo, this is
Alison DiLaurentis.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.513
Pleasure.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.416
- So are you new in town?
- Newish.

17:42.460 --> 17:46.851
Lorenzo is part of Rosewood
PD's fresh perspective.

17:46.890 --> 17:48.221
That's me.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.322
I spoke to Spencer
this morning.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.093
Good.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.563
Yeah, she seems okay.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.703
You know, physically.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.776
They went through a lot.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.243
We all did.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.149
How you doin'?

18:09.820 --> 18:11.583
I'm glad it's over.

18:11.620 --> 18:13.087
Me too.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.326
It was nice to
meet you, Lorenzo.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.089
It was great meeting you.

18:22.530 --> 18:23.758
See you later.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.768
[instrumental music]

18:28.770 --> 18:30.829
So that's the famous
Alison DiLaurentis.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.101
That's her.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.341
- Hello.
- Uh, hi.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.654
Mom, I wanted to
make a change.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.624
Kinda tired
of all this stuff.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.685
I get that.

18:52.730 --> 18:55.654
So we can either sell it
or gIve It away.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.827
(Ashley)
'I understand.‘

19:01.540 --> 19:03.269
But it's, you know too late

19:03.310 --> 19:04.800
to have a yard sale tonight.

19:06.540 --> 19:09.270
Why don't you
get a good night's sleep

19:09.310 --> 19:11.642
and we can talk _
about thIs In the mornIng?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.740
Uh, the bed is already
kind of in the hall, actually.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.558
What were you planning
to sleep on tonight, honey?

19:20.590 --> 19:22.785
- I don't know. The floor.
- You're not gonna do that.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.321
You can sleep with me,
but the furniture, we can--

19:24.360 --> 19:25.657
No, I can't look
at it anymore.

19:25.690 --> 19:26.850
It's ruined.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.561
Don't look at him,
look at me.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.335
How is it ruined?

19:36.370 --> 19:37.962
I just wanna make
a change, okay?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.672
I want to get rid
of some old furniture.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.575
I said, don't look at him!

19:42.610 --> 19:43.941
Why do you keep looking
back and forth?

19:43.980 --> 19:45.675
And why can't I just have
something that I want?

19:45.710 --> 19:47.439
Does that make me crazy?

19:50.250 --> 19:51.217
[door slams]

19:54.020 --> 19:56.659
Did you have a good time
with Hanna?

19:58.860 --> 20:00.498
[sighs]

20:00.530 --> 20:03.693
That was Jimmy from
the gun range on the phone.

20:03.730 --> 20:07.234
He called to tell me how _
happy he was to see you agaIn.

20:07.270 --> 20:10.637
He remembered you going
there with your dad..

20:10.670 --> 20:13.002
...and watching him teach you
the right way to do things.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.769
He did teach me
the right way.

20:14.810 --> 20:16.903
He'd understand
why I was there.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.476
Where did you find
the combination?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.717
I didn't find it,
I figured it out.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.513
I promise you, you're not gonna
figure out the next one.

20:22.550 --> 20:24.484
I've used dad's guns before.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.579
Never alone, Emily.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.987
That is not a rule
in this house, that is the law.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.727
You knew that, and yet
you sneak up here and just--

20:32.760 --> 20:33.988
_ You can't sneak
In your own house.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.327
This is not a debate.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.362
That locker is off limits.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.526
Understand?

20:39.670 --> 20:42.537
Emily, do you understand?

20:42.570 --> 20:44.299
Yes, ma'am.

20:45.770 --> 20:46.759
Emily..

20:48.510 --> 20:51.502
...the last thing I wanna do
is fight with you.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.801
If you wanna talk
about what happened--

20:52.850 --> 20:53.942
Not now.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.609
If you wanna talk
to somebody else

20:59.650 --> 21:01.481
they gave me names
of doctors at the hospital--

21:01.520 --> 21:02.919
I'm really tired.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.294
Maybe you should call Paige

21:07.330 --> 21:08.399
an-and let her know
what happened.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.499
Let her know you're okay.

21:09.530 --> 21:10.929
I did talk to her.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.695
She said she wanted
to come back.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.368
I told her not to.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.832
'I told her I was alright.‘

21:18.870 --> 21:20.974
And she shouldn't have
to come home.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.978
- Not for me.
- Em-—

21:23.010 --> 21:25.069
Paige did the right thing,
leaving town.

21:25.110 --> 21:28.045
I won't drag her
back into this.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.741
She deserves to be happy.

You forgot to make the bed.

I will.

21:53.740 --> 21:56.436
A nice blank canvas here.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.938
Any idea what
you wanna do with it?

21:59.980 --> 22:04.110
Not yet. I just wanted to get
rid of everything that was here.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.947
Well, maybe you can
get together with

22:05.990 --> 22:07.855
Aria and Spencer and Emily.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.348
Go shopping together
for some new things.

22:11.390 --> 22:14.723
- I don't wanna do that.
- They're your friends.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.467
Doesn't mean I have to see
them every second of every day.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.449
In that place...where you were--

22:34.480 --> 22:36.016
I don't wanna
talk about it.

Caleb said
you were In a room--

22:41.090 --> 22:43.627
That was not my room.
This is my room.

22:46.830 --> 22:50.664
What happened to you...
in that room?

22:52.670 --> 22:54.638
[dramatic music]

22:58.840 --> 23:00.000
Nothing.

[music continues]

23:06.710 --> 23:08.541
He just played games with us.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.684
What kind of games?

23:12.050 --> 23:14.484
Truth or dare.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.659
Who do you love more,
me or her?

23:18.530 --> 23:22.819
Who deserves water today,
you or somebody else?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.168
You decide
or you lose your turn

23:24.200 --> 23:25.963
and somebody else
gets to pick.

23:28.970 --> 23:31.404
Lots and lots of games.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.146
This is your room.

23:49.820 --> 23:52.721
Anything you want, baby.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.728
You want beanbag chairs..

23:56.560 --> 23:59.961
...Danish Modern,
you want...Day-Glo wicker..

24:03.840 --> 24:05.705
...you can have it.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.574
[dramatic music]

24:14.250 --> 24:17.219
There's circumstantial evidence
agaInst Andrew Campbell.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.686
So much that we're having
a hard time getting through it.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.210
We have a paper-trail
connecting him

24:22.260 --> 24:24.228
to the missile silo
where you were held.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.820
And the construction work
that was done there.

24:26.860 --> 24:29.124
How could a high school boy
afford all of that?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.822
One of the things we'd like
to know and so would the IRS.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.633
But you can prove
he's guilty?

24:33.670 --> 24:34.989
We're well on the way
to proving it.

24:36.870 --> 24:39.009
I'll do anything to help.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.498
At any point in the time
you were held hostage

24:42.540 --> 24:44.974
did you actually
see Andrew Campbell?

24:45.010 --> 24:49.117
Yeah, we saw him,
but he was masked.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.186
- Then you didn't see him.
- It was Andrew.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.653
He told me how much
he hated Mona.

24:55.690 --> 24:57.248
'He was always around when
something happened'

24:57.290 --> 24:59.758
'when my brother was attacked.‘

24:59.790 --> 25:01.758
I mean, it was Andrew
that was in my house

25:01.800 --> 25:03.768
pretending to help us
so he could watch us.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.018
- All that may be true--
- It is true.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.200
We're exploring
Andrew's motives.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.265
Tracking a timeline
that goes back years.

25:13.310 --> 25:17.030
Looking for confirmations
and discrepancies.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.776
'But what we don't have
is direct testimony'

25:19.810 --> 25:21.869
'that someone saw
Andrew Campbell'

25:21.920 --> 25:23.273
'at the scene of a crime.'

25:23.320 --> 25:25.140
'Ultimately, that could decide'

25:25.190 --> 25:29.286
if he walks away
or pays for what he's done.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.880
I did see him.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.091
Once, I saw his face.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.524
Where?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.888
When I was down there

25:40.940 --> 25:44.239
I, um, I saw him
without his mask.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.807
You just said
he was always masked.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.207
That was a mistake
but I remember now.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.778
I-I saw him. It was Andrew.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.175
Was anyone else with you
when you saw his face?

25:56.220 --> 25:57.812
No, I was alone.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.346
I saw him.

26:00.390 --> 26:01.812
That-that's what
you wanna know.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.657
That's what you need, right?

26:03.690 --> 26:06.124
I'm telling you, I saw his face.
It was Andrew Campbell.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.894
[dramatic music]

26:15.700 --> 26:18.806
I wanna thank you both
for coming in today.

26:18.840 --> 26:19.829
It's been very helpful.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.845
I'm helpin' buildin'
the case against Andrew.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.007
How's that going?

26:27.050 --> 26:28.972
It's lookin' pretty strong.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.883
Pretty strong?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.717
'What happened to "We're gonna
get the son-of-a-bitch?'"

26:34.760 --> 26:37.251
The manifesto, the van,
the electronics at the farm.

26:37.290 --> 26:40.020
I've been thinking
about all that.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.948
Why hold onto the van?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.729
Why not ditch it?

26:43.770 --> 26:47.695
'And why keep it so close
to where you're hiding?‘

26:47.740 --> 26:50.732
And why hide it some place
you could be linked to?

26:50.770 --> 26:52.306
Well, A is for arrogance.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.249
When I caught Andrew,
I wanted to take him apart

27:05.290 --> 27:07.281
because of what he
did to you.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.718
All I could think about
was you in that place.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.752
And I realized that I
don't know what happened.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.296
'I was there. I saw it.'

27:17.330 --> 27:20.697
But never really
talked about what happened.

27:22.900 --> 27:23.832
'Why?'

27:26.310 --> 27:28.073
[alarm blaring]

'Choose one,
or all will suffer.‘

27:32.850 --> 27:34.738
No.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.749
- 'Five, four..'
- No.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.953

'Three, two, one.'

Alison.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.015
Alison.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.418
Hi, Lorenzo.

28:47.450 --> 28:48.815
I know.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.420
The first time we met,
I was in uniform.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.497
Lot of people,
that's all they see.

28:54.530 --> 28:56.157
I remember you.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.498
It was nice seein'
a famIIIar face.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.122
I'm still pretty new.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.164
Me too.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.963
In church.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.137
I used to go
when I was a kid.

29:07.170 --> 29:09.900
And then I didn't go.

29:09.940 --> 29:12.909
And now...I don't know.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.318
Yeah, that's how
it was for me.

29:16.350 --> 29:19.444
You go, then you get
too smart for it.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.481
Then you start to wonder
how smart you actually are.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.855
I like the music.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.187
Yeah, the music's great.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.821
- I gotta go.
- Sure.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.097
Hey, don't worry.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.998
About what?

29:39.040 --> 29:41.508
I won't tell anybody
I saw you in church.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.444
What makes you think
I don't want people to know?

29:45.480 --> 29:49.177
I don't know.
I just know that you don't.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.158
You went back,
after we talked.

30:00.190 --> 30:03.296
After I changed the combination.
You went back?

30:03.330 --> 30:06.060
You just said I couldn't
use dad's, so I rented a gun.

30:06.100 --> 30:09.194
Seriously, Emily? I need to know
what's going on with you.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.208
Dad's defending people,
why can't I defend us?

30:11.240 --> 30:13.299
Because this has nothing
to do with defending

30:13.340 --> 30:14.568
anything and you know it.

30:14.610 --> 30:17.431
You never bring anger
to a firing range. Ever!

30:17.480 --> 30:20.108
- I'm not angry.
- I saw you, Emily!

30:30.220 --> 30:33.485
They said we were
down there for three weeks.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.327
Is that right?

30:35.360 --> 30:37.225
It was a little bit
longer than that.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.367
Well, it felt like..

30:47.510 --> 30:51.469
I don't know
what it felt like.

30:51.510 --> 30:54.172
After a while there
wasn't any tIme anymore.

30:57.150 --> 31:00.142
That girl, Sara.
You saw her.

31:00.190 --> 31:02.351
Did you see her eyes?

31:02.390 --> 31:05.188
- Her eyes?
- Did you look at her eyes?

31:07.690 --> 31:08.998
I did.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.890
She was down there for years.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.599
And you could see
that in her eyes.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.374
What would have happened if
I'd been down there for years?

31:22.410 --> 31:26.369
Emily, the person who
did this is behind bars.

31:26.410 --> 31:29.277
You mean, there isn't
any more bad people out there?

31:29.320 --> 31:32.118
There's nobody who's ever
gonna hurt anybody again?

31:32.150 --> 31:36.519
A gun isn't gonna change that.
Not for you, not for anyone.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.028
'I know.‘

31:39.060 --> 31:40.482
I was afraid.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.021
And I thought..

31:46.570 --> 31:49.164
...maybe it could
take away some of the fear.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.166
[dramatic music]

31:55.980 --> 31:57.436
But it didn't.

31:59.310 --> 32:01.073
It made it worse.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.917
It makes you the same
as what you're afraid of.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.187
Honey, I'm sorry.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.921
[dramatic music]

32:18.070 --> 32:20.288
And I screwed up
on a global scale.

32:20.330 --> 32:21.695
I mean, Ijust..
I wanted to help.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.230
I just wanted it
to be over with.

32:23.270 --> 32:24.567
I mean, there were
whole parts of my brain

32:24.610 --> 32:26.464
that were trying
to stop me from lying

32:26.510 --> 32:28.705
and the stupid parts won.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.106
Yeah, well, the stupid brain
is small, but it's wily.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.106
I might as well
have opened the cell door

32:33.150 --> 32:34.447
and let Andrew walk out.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.970
No, I don't think
it's as bad as that.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.339
It's not good.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.513
No, it's not good.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.518
But I understand the impulse.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.456
I know, well,
thanks for coming over.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.627
Yeah, thank you
for calling me.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.389
I'm sorry.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.408
Sorry for what?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.108
So Hanna called
and she thinks that

33:06.150 --> 33:08.618
we should all go
to school tomorrow.

33:08.650 --> 33:12.211
Yeah, um,
that's not a bad idea.

33:12.250 --> 33:13.547
- Jus_t--
- 'ArIa!'

33:13.590 --> 33:16.286
- 'Can I borrow you?‘
- Yeah, sure.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.389
I'll be right back.

33:17.420 --> 33:18.523
Okay.

[instrumental music]

33:45.490 --> 33:46.081
[whirring]

33:50.290 --> 33:51.450
Alright, there you go.

33:51.490 --> 33:52.684
[sighs]
Thank you.

33:54.430 --> 33:57.194
At least now my mom can
have her privacy back.

33:57.230 --> 33:59.824
How's it feel?

33:59.870 --> 34:02.293
Well, like I'm about
to be boxed and shipped.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.543
Have I ever told you that

34:12.580 --> 34:15.174
I think you're the bravest
person I've ever met?

34:15.220 --> 34:16.209
I don't think so.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.587
But you can try it.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.088
You're the bravest
person I've ever met.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.758
'I like it.'

34:23.790 --> 34:26.827
It's not true,
but I like the sound of it.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.555
It is true.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.727
And you're gonna
get through this.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.160
You and your friends.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.088
How is that gonna happen
when I'm having a hard time

34:35.140 --> 34:37.290
looking them in the eye?

34:37.340 --> 34:39.604
'You will.'

34:39.640 --> 34:43.303
That's what people do,
they mend.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.444
You taught me that.

34:45.480 --> 34:49.143
'And sometimes you end up
stronger at the broken places.‘

34:54.490 --> 34:57.379
Do you know what I want?

34:57.420 --> 34:58.387
What?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.528
I want my night table back.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.626
[instrumental music]

35:10.670 --> 35:12.160
[indistinct chatter]

35:17.710 --> 35:21.476
I'm sorry if I was rude
to you in front of church.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.613
I'm embarrassed about it.

35:23.650 --> 35:25.618
Not embarrassed about going.

35:25.650 --> 35:28.551
Embarrassed about
what people might think.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.649
I'm sure Toby, he's told you
plenty about me.

35:30.690 --> 35:33.488
So you can understand
why people seeing me at church

35:33.530 --> 35:35.555
would say,
"She's just there for show"

35:35.600 --> 35:38.626
or maybe,
"She went crazy in jail."

35:38.670 --> 35:42.731
Which is not true, really.
Either one.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.675
Would you like one
of these little hamburgers?

35:55.450 --> 35:56.417
Thanks.

[instrumental music]

36:09.960 --> 36:12.269
I'm gonna leave
in just a minute.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.187
[camera shutter clicking]

36:43.730 --> 36:45.721
I've been sitting
in the other room

36:45.770 --> 36:47.829
trying to come up
with a way to ask you

36:47.870 --> 36:51.636
about what happened today
at the police station.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.467
Well, I think you just did.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.703
Do you wanna talk about it?

36:57.740 --> 36:59.879
Oh, I think I've
said enough, don't you?

37:01.350 --> 37:02.977
I've done enough
damage, talking.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.683
I'm just gonna stick to
the visuals from now on.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.028
The police talked to us

37:14.060 --> 37:17.325
after they brought you
out of that place.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.363
They told us what it was like.
Not in detail.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.007
So you didn't see?

37:25.040 --> 37:26.359
No.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.977
[sighs]
Good.

'We all want the person
who did that to you'

37:32.080 --> 37:34.344
'caught and punished.‘

37:34.380 --> 37:36.473
We may want different
levels of that punishment

37:36.520 --> 37:37.646
but it's what we all want.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.886
It was him.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.388
It was Andrew.
It has to be Andrew.

37:41.420 --> 37:43.911
Aria, you're very smart.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.656
But please remember,
you're also very wise.

but it's callin' me *

* So loud I can't even think

38:15.420 --> 38:19.550
* The memory that you
left in me *

38:19.590 --> 38:23.048
* Is something
I won't soon forget *

38:23.100 --> 38:27.924
* Placed in my mind
like a bad film *

38:27.970 --> 38:31.064

* I'm gonna see you through

38:45.490 --> 38:46.684
Sara?

38:46.720 --> 38:48.881
I saw your address
in the hospital.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.684
- I didn't know where to go.
- What happened?

38:51.730 --> 38:52.879
I ran away.

38:58.130 --> 39:00.826
She was happy to see you.
Your mom. She must have been.

39:00.870 --> 39:02.690
Maybe it was just really hard
for her to show you

39:02.740 --> 39:05.561
because you were gone so long.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.579
When I was gone..

39:08.610 --> 39:11.477
...people were very
sympathetic with my mother.

39:11.510 --> 39:14.149
They paid attention to her.

39:14.180 --> 39:18.844
Then I came home
and I spoiled everything.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.517
I should've stayed in that hole.

39:20.550 --> 39:22.711
- Don't say that.
- I should have.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.024
I was finally doing something
to make my mother happy.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.590
Well, no one's goin'
anywhere tonight.

39:29.630 --> 39:32.098
You can stay, Sara, but we've
gotta call your mother.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.730
You can try.

39:35.770 --> 39:36.998
Alright, I'll make
up the sofa.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.359
Okay.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.605
It'll be alright.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.175
Don't think about that place.
It's all over.

39:48.210 --> 39:49.973
We're gonna get
some justice now.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.457
Emily, that guy
they caught..

39:55.820 --> 39:57.708
Andrew.
What about him?

39:59.060 --> 40:01.119
I saw him on TV.
