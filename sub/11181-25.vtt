WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:03.417
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:03.555 --> 00:05.971
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:06.109 --> 00:10.941
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.080 --> 00:13.910
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.048 --> 00:16.982
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.120 --> 00:21.504
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:22.712 --> 00:25.232
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.370 --> 00:27.889
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.028 --> 00:30.478
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:30.616 --> 00:33.136
Just to get up that hill

00:33.274 --> 00:35.759
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:35.897 --> 00:38.279
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:38.417 --> 00:40.937
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.075 --> 00:42.490
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:42.628 --> 00:45.424
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:45.562 --> 00:48.462
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:48.600 --> 00:52.914
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.053 --> 00:55.883
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.021 --> 00:59.024
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.162 --> 01:03.615
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.862 --> 01:12.072
Well, still behaving
yourselves?

01:12.624 --> 01:14.074
That's nice.

01:15.247 --> 01:17.318
When are you gonna
get out of here?

01:17.456 --> 01:20.252
What are you kidding?
I haven't even started
on the bedrooms yet.

01:21.805 --> 01:25.050
Oh, hey, lady,
you're a good cook.

01:26.914 --> 01:27.915
Thank you.

01:30.814 --> 01:33.610
That reminds me,
I'm starving.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.923
Just like old times,
huh?

01:36.061 --> 01:38.719
Yeah. Remember those
chocolate cakes you
used to make? Mmm...

01:38.857 --> 01:41.998
I remember what you tried
to do with one of them.

01:44.069 --> 01:46.761
Look, I know what you're
thinking, Bunker. But I'm
talking about all the people.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.316
Blacks, browns,
yellows and whites.

01:49.454 --> 01:51.766
How come you put the
whites last?

01:53.527 --> 01:56.081
Look, I just wanna help
the community.

01:56.599 --> 01:59.153
Edith, the phone.

01:59.291 --> 02:00.568
Well, if you wanna
help the community,

02:00.706 --> 02:03.226
you can bring the prices
down in your store there.

02:03.364 --> 02:06.885
EDITH: Hello?
I mean, $12 to fix
that hole, that's a disgrace.

02:07.023 --> 02:10.923
Yeah, Louise,
he's here.
Oh...

02:13.719 --> 02:18.034
Louise wants to know
what happened to her
chocolate cake.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.588
Oh, the cake, huh?

02:20.726 --> 02:24.730
Tell Louise that George is
over here trying to
buy votes with it.

02:26.249 --> 02:29.666
Yeah, I'll tell him,
Louise. Goodbye.

02:29.804 --> 02:34.154
Louise wants to see you
back home right away.

02:34.292 --> 02:39.469
Imagine that. Only one day
in politics, and already
he's stealing and bribing.

02:41.471 --> 02:45.061
And now he expects
me to sign this
here petition of his.

02:45.199 --> 02:49.307
Look, I hear you loud
and clear, Bunker. And I
don't need you anyway.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.587
You ain't the only
honky on the beach.

02:56.969 --> 03:01.319
Can you beat that?
A guy comes waltzing in
here with a petition.

03:01.457 --> 03:03.976
Wants me to
sign the thing
without even reading it.

03:04.114 --> 03:06.427
Now, I mean,
he takes the cake.

03:21.097 --> 03:24.411
Yeah. Archie could
drive you mad.

03:24.549 --> 03:27.414
But at least he was
the devil we knew.

03:27.552 --> 03:32.142
When we moved here I was
so worried about the new
people we were going to meet.

03:32.281 --> 03:35.215
And then the first
neighbor we met
was Mr. Bentley.

03:35.353 --> 03:37.907
He was so nice
and friendly.

03:38.287 --> 03:39.667
And weird.

03:41.462 --> 03:43.775
You think Mr. Bentley
is weird?

03:43.913 --> 03:46.709
Have you ever
taken a good
look at us?

03:46.847 --> 03:49.505
What are you talking
about? Ain't nothing
strange about us.

03:49.643 --> 03:51.231
Oh, no?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.750
You wanna try it again?
Well...

03:53.888 --> 03:55.027
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

03:55.165 --> 03:56.753
George Jefferson!

04:08.627 --> 04:11.320
Well, Weezy,
what do you think?

04:11.458 --> 04:15.324
I think you should pick
door number three.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.984
Oh, George,
you all right?
Of course I'm all right.

04:21.122 --> 04:22.434
What are you two
doing here?

04:22.572 --> 04:24.471
Just visiting, Snoopy.

04:26.956 --> 04:28.854
Are you sure we're
putting this on right?

04:28.992 --> 04:30.442
I think so.

04:31.788 --> 04:34.929
Wait a minute,
Mrs. Jefferson.
This thing is heavy.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.554
Well, I'm gonna
have to carry it.
Let it go, Florence.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.038
All right...

04:57.158 --> 04:58.746
Lord have mercy!

05:03.648 --> 05:05.063
Can I open my
eyes now, George?

05:05.201 --> 05:07.893
If I was you, I would
keep them closed.

05:10.137 --> 05:12.381
Reach!

05:17.317 --> 05:19.560
Oh, my goodness...

05:21.251 --> 05:24.462
It's my boxer shorts
from the Navy. I ain't
seen these in years.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.670
What's that?

05:25.808 --> 05:27.327
Oh, that's my cup.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.514
Your cup?

05:42.652 --> 05:45.345
How in the heck do
you drink out of that?

05:47.139 --> 05:50.419
That Florence. You never
know what she's
gonna say or do.

05:50.557 --> 05:52.766
Like that time
I told her all I wanted
was a good maid.

05:54.043 --> 05:56.390
And you certainly
got one.

05:57.736 --> 05:59.393
Hello, George.

05:59.531 --> 06:01.637
Where's Florence?
She's in her room.

06:01.775 --> 06:02.983
Good...

06:10.300 --> 06:12.993
Good evening,
Master Jefferson, sir.

06:13.131 --> 06:14.615
What are you wearing?

06:14.753 --> 06:18.101
Why this is my new
maiden uniform.
I's bought it today, sir.

06:18.239 --> 06:20.690
Why? Are we having
pancakes for dinner?

06:23.313 --> 06:27.179
Oh, that's funny.
You the funniest
man, Mr. Jefferson.

06:27.317 --> 06:29.043
Ain't he funny,
Miss Jefferson?

06:29.181 --> 06:32.046
If he were any funnier,
they'd put him away.

06:33.703 --> 06:36.810
Um, um, you give me
them shoes, Master Jefferson.
For what?

06:36.948 --> 06:38.225
They need shining!

06:38.363 --> 06:40.503
Look, Florence...
Now just let me help
you take them off.

06:40.641 --> 06:43.264
Look, Florence, you
don't have to do that.
Oh, I don't mind.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.233
Just lift your little foot.
Look, you ain't supposed to
be shining nobody's shoes.

06:46.371 --> 06:48.028
Why? Don't you think I
can do a good job?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.582
Well, sure you could, but...
Well then just let me
help you take them off.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.515
Florence, you get
off my shoes.

06:52.653 --> 06:55.415
Oh, Lord, mercy me!
I done made you mad!

06:59.315 --> 07:01.041
You's disappointed in me.

07:01.179 --> 07:02.560
No, I ain't. I...

07:02.698 --> 07:05.459
I'm sorry, boss!
Florence! Hey!
Stop it, Florence!

07:05.597 --> 07:06.564
Will you get this
woman off me?

07:06.702 --> 07:09.567
Oh, please now,
don't be mad!
Hey!

07:09.705 --> 07:11.810
I'll get it!
I'll get it!

07:13.087 --> 07:15.435
We've had some good
times here, George.

07:15.573 --> 07:19.818
Yeah.
Lionel and Jenny
got married here.

07:19.956 --> 07:22.821
I thought you were
remembering the good times?

07:22.959 --> 07:26.618
Well, it was touch and
go with Lionel before
we got that far.

07:31.002 --> 07:35.316
Oh, look at this guy
with his suitcase. What
are you moving in, too?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.767
Hell, no. This is
Lionel's suitcase.

07:37.905 --> 07:40.183
I wanna get him out of here
as soon as possible.

07:40.321 --> 07:42.565
If he wants to stay in
a motel, here's the
money to pay for it.

07:42.703 --> 07:44.740
I don't want him asking
for nothing from this house.

07:44.878 --> 07:48.226
If my son wants to run
away, I can afford it.

07:48.364 --> 07:51.056
Don't pay him any attention,
Archie, he's crazy.

07:51.194 --> 07:55.026
What?
He's not going to any
motel. He's staying here!

07:55.164 --> 07:57.477
He ain't gonna shame me
by staying here.

07:57.615 --> 08:00.756
Louise, I think
your husband's right.

08:00.894 --> 08:04.622
George, I want you to
apologize to our son.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.589
We don't have a son,
Louise.

08:06.727 --> 08:11.180
But don't worry. We can
start all over again. You can
give me another boy.

08:11.318 --> 08:13.493
You better call Parcel Post,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.500
'cause I've stopped
making deliveries.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.712
I don't wanna hear this.

08:25.850 --> 08:29.681
Remember Lionel's
graduation day?
Everything went just perfect.

08:29.819 --> 08:32.581
Yeah, he got perfectly drunk.

08:32.719 --> 08:34.548
Drunk? I didn't know that.

08:35.273 --> 08:37.137
I know you didn't.

08:42.729 --> 08:45.421
Well, isn't this nice?
No.

08:47.423 --> 08:49.667
Well, isn't this nice?

08:51.738 --> 08:53.567
Don't you two have
anything else to say?

08:53.705 --> 08:55.569
Oh, sure.

08:55.707 --> 08:58.296
Lionel!
What the heck is
wrong with you?

08:59.918 --> 09:04.129
It is your suit,
Mr. Jefferson. I've fallen
in love with this suit.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.856
The style, the fabric,
the lining.

09:06.994 --> 09:09.859
Oh, the lining is
doing it do death!

09:09.997 --> 09:12.034
You know what
else I think?

09:15.313 --> 09:16.866
You know what else I think?

09:17.004 --> 09:20.042
Do you have to
think so loud?
Well, uh, uh, uh...

09:20.180 --> 09:23.563
I was thinking, Mr.
Jefferson, that I... I have
always admired you.

09:23.701 --> 09:25.185
Uh, uh...

09:25.323 --> 09:28.533
A self-made man
who came up the hard way.
All the way from nothing.

09:28.671 --> 09:30.915
Now you've got five
cleaning stores.
Six.

09:31.053 --> 09:32.364
Six! That's right.

09:32.502 --> 09:35.091
And who knows? Maybe someday
they'll be seven or eight.

09:35.229 --> 09:36.990
But, see the point is,
Mr. Jefferson,

09:37.128 --> 09:40.718
you did it by yourself.
And to think, it started out

09:40.856 --> 09:44.066
in a cotton field in Alabama
46 years ago.
Forty-five.

09:44.204 --> 09:45.895
No!

09:46.033 --> 09:49.485
That's even more remarkable.
To get this far so soon?

09:49.623 --> 09:52.522
Why, you're still a young man,
Mr. Jefferson.

09:52.661 --> 09:55.077
Young looking, too. You know,
if I didn't know you,

09:55.215 --> 09:58.943
I'd never guess
you were old enough to
be Lionel's father.

10:11.162 --> 10:15.097
I know why she's out
of breath, but why are
you breathing so hard?

10:15.718 --> 10:17.720
I can't help myself.

10:17.858 --> 10:20.067
I get carried away
when I'm...

10:20.205 --> 10:22.311
When I'm this
close to you.

10:24.865 --> 10:28.420
And he and Jenny
had their problems
along the way, too.

10:31.389 --> 10:34.219
Jenny, I don't
understand this.
Oh, come on, Mama,

10:34.357 --> 10:36.981
come on now. Get down.

10:37.119 --> 10:38.983
Uh, look, Jenny, your mother
told me you were crying

10:39.121 --> 10:41.088
as though your
heart was breaking.

10:41.226 --> 10:45.472
Well, you know how Mama
likes to exaggerate.

10:45.610 --> 10:47.508
Come on, Pop, get down.

10:49.856 --> 10:51.892
Exaggerate?
I did not exaggerate.

10:52.030 --> 10:55.171
Something was going on
between you and Lionel.

10:56.897 --> 11:00.038
Yeah, well, uh,
nothing much.

11:01.246 --> 11:04.871
We had a disagreement,
that's all.
That's all?

11:05.009 --> 11:08.150
Yeah, but, we came to
an understanding.

11:08.288 --> 11:10.670
You see, Helen,
there's no problem.

11:11.981 --> 11:14.087
What kind of understanding?

11:19.023 --> 11:22.371
Jenny, what kind of
understanding?
The wedding is off.

11:25.132 --> 11:26.202
What?

11:28.377 --> 11:31.725
Look, here, Jenny...
Tom, will you stop dancing?

11:33.485 --> 11:36.419
Do you have any objections
to your daughter marrying
Lionel?

11:36.557 --> 11:39.008
Of course not.
Lionel's a
fine young man.

11:39.146 --> 11:41.493
In spite of
his father.

11:41.631 --> 11:43.185
Well, do you have any
objections to your son

11:43.323 --> 11:44.945
marrying Jenny?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.983
It ain't that. It's just
the kind of wedding he's
throwing that I object to.

11:48.121 --> 11:51.780
Well, that's such a silly
thing to argue about.

11:51.918 --> 11:54.852
The basic wedding ceremony
is very simple.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.612
And it's quite beautiful.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.926
You see, all the minister
has to do is say,

12:00.064 --> 12:03.343
"Lionel,
do you take Jenny to
be your lawful wedded wife?"

12:03.481 --> 12:05.552
And then
Lionel would say...

12:05.690 --> 12:07.450
I do.

12:07.588 --> 12:10.143
And then he would say,
"Jenny, do you take Lionel

12:10.281 --> 12:12.248
"to be your lawful
wedded husband?"

12:12.386 --> 12:13.733
And then Jenny
would say...

12:14.630 --> 12:15.735
I do.

12:16.666 --> 12:19.359
You see?
It's all very simple.

12:19.497 --> 12:24.226
And as long as it's
witnessed by two people,
like those over there,

12:25.192 --> 12:27.160
then all the minister
has to do is say,

12:27.298 --> 12:30.991
"By the power
vested in me by
the state of New York,

12:31.129 --> 12:34.754
"I now pronounce you
man and wife."

12:46.558 --> 12:49.147
Oh, my baby!

12:50.977 --> 12:53.289
Weezy, now what's
wrong with you?

12:54.083 --> 12:56.396
I always cry at weddings.

12:56.534 --> 12:58.743
If you're crying now,
what you gonna do at
the real wedding?

12:58.881 --> 13:01.988
George, this is
the real wedding!

13:02.574 --> 13:03.713
What?

13:04.853 --> 13:07.787
She's right, George.
Our children are married.

13:09.098 --> 13:10.410
They're what?

13:12.032 --> 13:14.483
You mean that was it?

13:14.621 --> 13:19.315
Lionel, how could you
do this to me?
'Cause I love you, Pop.

13:19.453 --> 13:22.802
And you know I just didn't
wanna get married without
you being there.

13:23.561 --> 13:25.528
Married? Without a band?

13:27.634 --> 13:31.189
And I love my daddy.

13:31.327 --> 13:34.054
Did you really marry them?
Nope. They married
each other.

13:34.192 --> 13:35.159
I just performed
the ceremony.

13:36.885 --> 13:40.405
Oh, George...
Oh, don't cry, Weezy.

13:40.543 --> 13:44.064
Think of the good side.
What good side?

13:44.202 --> 13:46.204
We're together.
You and me.

13:53.142 --> 13:55.420
Remember your old Navy buddy?

14:03.808 --> 14:07.018
Now, let's get
something straight,
Wendell.

14:07.156 --> 14:09.158
You'd better keep
away from me.

14:09.296 --> 14:11.954
Hey, Louise...
Don't you
"Hey, Louise" me.

14:12.092 --> 14:14.301
You're supposed to be
George's best friend.

14:14.439 --> 14:17.684
Where do you get off
making passes at me,
and right under his nose, too?

14:17.822 --> 14:19.099
Hey, easy, Mama!

14:19.237 --> 14:21.584
The only reason I haven't
said anything earlier

14:21.722 --> 14:23.655
is because I didn't wanna
hurt George's feelings.

14:23.793 --> 14:26.658
But if you put your hand on me
one more time,

14:26.796 --> 14:28.902
you're gonna
draw back a nub!

14:36.082 --> 14:40.293
Oh, no, no, Weezy,
you got me wrong.
I ain't gonna use my hands.

14:40.431 --> 14:41.811
Look? Look?

14:45.608 --> 14:48.680
Whoo-wee!

14:51.718 --> 14:54.721
I like a woman with
a little fire.

14:54.859 --> 14:58.483
Now I'm warning you, Wendell,
you take one more step
and I'll let loose

14:58.621 --> 15:00.830
with the loudest scream
you ever heard!

15:00.969 --> 15:05.905
Hey, that sounds groovy.
Because we both understand
that a no means yes!

15:06.940 --> 15:08.908
Not in this house
it don't!

15:17.502 --> 15:21.265
Yeah. Wendell was hitting
on you, and Mama
was hitting on him.

15:22.231 --> 15:24.924
Yeah, that was
quite a night.

15:25.062 --> 15:27.823
You know something, Weezy?
Maybe you never noticed this,

15:27.961 --> 15:29.790
but sometimes I don't
appreciate you enough.

15:34.002 --> 15:35.555
Really?

15:38.523 --> 15:39.697
How many years have
you known Mom?

15:39.835 --> 15:42.562
I don't know.
Twenty-five, 26...

15:42.700 --> 15:44.219
What does it
matter now?

15:44.357 --> 15:46.290
It's all dirty water
under the bridge.

15:46.428 --> 15:48.740
And how many times
has she lied to you?

15:48.878 --> 15:51.571
Weezy never lied to me.
You see?

15:51.709 --> 15:55.195
She just never
told me things she
didn't want me to know.

15:55.816 --> 15:57.370
You know she loves you.

15:57.508 --> 15:58.716
What's that got to
do with it?

15:58.854 --> 16:00.511
Louise loves everybody.

16:00.649 --> 16:03.548
Ah-ha!
Look, don't you
ah-ha me.

16:03.686 --> 16:06.689
There've been enough
ah-ha's for one day.

16:06.827 --> 16:10.348
Pop, remember when any of
the old neighbors in Harlem
used to get sick?

16:10.486 --> 16:12.730
Who was it who always
looked after them?
Your mother.

16:12.868 --> 16:15.491
That's another one
of Weezy's faults.
Always helping people.

16:15.629 --> 16:17.907
And stray cats and dogs.
Yeah, and stray cats.

16:18.046 --> 16:19.909
Always petting them,
and hugging them,
and picking them up.

16:20.048 --> 16:22.636
And feeding them better
than she feeds me.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.192
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Mom is, um...

16:26.330 --> 16:27.883
Too sentimental.
Mmm-hmm...

16:28.021 --> 16:30.644
She'd hug an rhinoceros
if it was lost.

16:34.372 --> 16:37.030
There's something I wanna say.
Yes, I wanna say something
to you, too.

16:37.168 --> 16:40.309
Would you let me say
my say first?
Uh, sorry, George.

16:40.447 --> 16:45.280
Well, when I went
out of here before,
I went over to Mama's.

16:45.418 --> 16:47.075
You went crying
to your mother?

16:47.213 --> 16:49.560
I didn't go crying,
I went mad!

16:49.698 --> 16:53.150
Oh, I thought it was
the wife who was always
supposed to run away to mama.

16:53.288 --> 16:56.049
Will you cut it out
before I get mad again?

16:57.947 --> 17:00.743
Anyway, she told me
something about you.

17:00.881 --> 17:02.849
Oh, I bet she did.

17:02.987 --> 17:06.646
No, I mean
something nice.
Oh.

17:06.784 --> 17:09.407
She knew you were jiving
this morning about us
going out with the Hendrixs.

17:09.545 --> 17:12.617
She did?
Mmm-hmm. She read it
in your face.

17:12.755 --> 17:14.861
So I got to
thinking.

17:14.999 --> 17:17.691
No matter how much
you wanted us to
be alone together,

17:17.829 --> 17:19.969
you had trouble
making up that story.

17:20.108 --> 17:23.697
That's right. That's like
what I wanted to tell you,
George. You see...

17:23.835 --> 17:25.527
Will you hush up?

17:28.254 --> 17:30.842
Anyhow, I can
see it plain now.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.604
If you can't lie
for yourself,

17:33.742 --> 17:35.951
then I had no business
asking you to lie for me.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.746
Thank you, George.

17:38.505 --> 17:39.989
Now what you
got to say?

17:40.128 --> 17:43.338
Oh, it doesn't matter. I
think you nearly said it.

17:43.476 --> 17:45.064
Good.

17:45.202 --> 17:48.791
See your trouble, Weezy,
is you were born honest.
You know?

17:51.587 --> 17:54.452
I guess that's one of
the reasons I feel
about you the way I do.

17:54.590 --> 17:56.903
Oh? What way is that,
George?

17:58.353 --> 18:00.769
Well, you know,
I told you before.

18:02.288 --> 18:04.186
What did you
tell me before?

18:04.324 --> 18:06.257
You know,
something nice.

18:07.845 --> 18:09.605
You mean that
I'm beautiful?

18:09.743 --> 18:10.744
No.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.302
You mean
I'm not beautiful?

18:16.440 --> 18:17.441
No, I didn't say that.

18:17.579 --> 18:19.753
Well, you better
say something.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.342
All right.

18:24.033 --> 18:25.380
I love you.

18:26.035 --> 18:27.002
I love you.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.659
Oh, George...

18:32.594 --> 18:35.873
Oh, I love you, too.
Happy anniversary.

18:36.011 --> 18:38.427
Happy anniversary, Weezy.
You're a good woman.

18:38.565 --> 18:39.911
A very good woman.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.016
You know,

18:41.154 --> 18:43.018
you really deserve me.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.032
I think I heard him
coming back.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.930
Can you hear him?
No.

18:59.068 --> 19:00.932
Look, I don't care
what that turkey steals
out there, Weezy.

19:01.070 --> 19:03.072
As long as he
don't hurt you.

19:03.211 --> 19:05.074
Oh, George.

19:05.213 --> 19:06.938
I don't think I could
live without you, Weez.

19:08.492 --> 19:09.424
He's coming for us!

19:09.562 --> 19:10.942
Don't panic, Weezy.
I'll get him.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.394
I ain't cleaning up
after no wild party.
Oh...

19:14.532 --> 19:17.121
That place looks like
it's been looted.

19:21.056 --> 19:23.679
Florence, quick, untie us!

19:23.817 --> 19:25.164
I never thought
the day would come

19:25.302 --> 19:26.958
when I'd be glad
to see you.

19:27.096 --> 19:28.132
Is he still out there?

19:28.270 --> 19:29.720
Who?
The burglar!

19:29.858 --> 19:31.170
What burglar?

19:31.308 --> 19:32.757
The front door's wide open,

19:32.895 --> 19:35.657
and there ain't nothing
out there but a big mess.

19:35.795 --> 19:37.659
Thank God he's gone.

19:37.797 --> 19:39.212
What happened?
Who did it?

19:39.350 --> 19:40.731
How did he get in?
What did he look like?

19:40.869 --> 19:44.631
How come your hands
don't work as fast
as your mouth?

19:44.769 --> 19:48.048
We don't know who it
was, but thank God you
came back.

19:49.015 --> 19:51.431
Oh, how... Why did you
come back so soon?

19:51.569 --> 19:53.157
What happened to
your date?

19:53.295 --> 19:56.125
That ugly, no-account
turkey didn't show up.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.714
You said he was smart.

20:01.165 --> 20:03.340
I think I'll untie
you first.

20:05.342 --> 20:07.344
How long you
been like this?

20:07.482 --> 20:08.690
Oh, I don't know.

20:08.828 --> 20:10.588
It seems like hours.

20:12.728 --> 20:14.316
Just you and him?

20:15.662 --> 20:17.181
You poor woman.

20:18.355 --> 20:20.288
What did you do
all that time?

20:20.426 --> 20:21.910
Oh, we talked.

20:22.048 --> 20:23.946
Talked?
About what?

20:24.084 --> 20:26.363
Oh, Florence,
it was beautiful.

20:26.501 --> 20:28.572
I was scared to
death tonight,

20:28.710 --> 20:30.401
but I'll always cherish...

20:30.539 --> 20:33.266
It ain't none of your
damn business
what we talked about!

20:33.404 --> 20:35.441
I was trying to get us loose
so I could catch that crook.

20:35.579 --> 20:37.477
What we talked about
don't matter.

20:37.615 --> 20:39.479
Mr. Jefferson's right.

20:39.617 --> 20:41.688
We were pretty busy.

20:41.826 --> 20:46.417
That's why I guess I
can't remember anything
we talked about.

20:51.595 --> 20:54.218
Well, don't just
stand there, untie me!

20:54.839 --> 20:55.840
What?

20:57.842 --> 21:00.845
Hey, Weezy, where you going?
Hey, wait a minute.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.297
I gotta go to the bathroom!

21:32.221 --> 21:34.258
We movin' on up
