WEBVTT

00:02.521 --> 00:03.820
All right, everybody,

00:03.857 --> 00:05.456
let's go ahead and start to shut up.

00:05.491 --> 00:07.291
We're gonna jump right
in on the one subject

00:07.327 --> 00:09.193
that brings me a little
bit of joy in Toledo

00:09.229 --> 00:10.796
where I find myself currently trapped...

00:10.941 --> 00:12.774
Taking down my rival Miles.

00:12.809 --> 00:14.343
Now, I had a pretty good idea.

00:14.378 --> 00:16.277
I was thinking maybe we
could hack into his Tesla.

00:16.312 --> 00:18.013
How hard would that be?
I know it's possible.

00:18.048 --> 00:19.243
You think you guys could do that,

00:19.243 --> 00:20.407
or are you guys the kinda nerds

00:20.407 --> 00:21.547
that are good at computers,

00:21.547 --> 00:22.646
or are you the kinda nerds

00:22.681 --> 00:24.182
that smell bad and wear capes?

00:30.059 --> 00:32.525
Uh, you know what? Let's
go ahead a pin in that,

00:32.561 --> 00:34.695
because a cute girl who
actually meets my standards

00:34.730 --> 00:36.426
has swiped right on me.

00:36.481 --> 00:38.048
I don't know if you guys
know what that means,

00:38.083 --> 00:40.416
but basically, it just means
that it's... it's bang time.

00:41.395 --> 00:44.192
Is it going to be happening
here in front of us?

00:44.192 --> 00:45.753
No, Anthony, it's not gonna be happening

00:45.753 --> 00:47.152
in front of you, you little freak!

00:47.187 --> 00:48.489
No, we're gonna go get a drink.

00:48.489 --> 00:49.922
Guys, gotta say...

00:49.958 --> 00:51.831
I got a really good feeling about this one.

00:51.856 --> 00:53.161
Can I get a "get some"?

00:53.161 --> 00:54.299
Get some!

00:54.762 --> 00:56.598
That's my girl! All right!

00:57.247 --> 00:59.541
Um... see ya, dudes.

<i>Now boarding for New York city.</i>

01:39.073 --> 01:41.255
Whoo!

01:51.107 --> 01:52.807
If it's on my license, you know,

01:52.870 --> 01:54.369
they're not gonna want to save me.

01:54.404 --> 01:55.604
- No.
- They're gonna wanna

01:55.639 --> 01:56.763
- harvest my organs.
- Yes!

01:56.763 --> 01:58.115
That's what they want, they want my organs.

01:58.115 --> 02:00.249
Yes, exactly. And I am
not gonna die on the table

02:00.283 --> 02:02.984
so some drunk slob can get my liver.

02:03.019 --> 02:04.385
No, no, no. No, that's not fair.

02:04.421 --> 02:05.753
- No!
- You should have your liver.

02:05.788 --> 02:07.555
It's very good. It's pristine.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.103
- Yeah, exactly.
- Nice...

02:14.822 --> 02:17.490
So, you wanna... head up to your place?

02:18.493 --> 02:20.726
I really like you, Jack.

02:20.761 --> 02:23.480
I just... I just wanna get to
know you a little bit better.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.487
Yeah, sure. More dates.

02:27.061 --> 02:28.212
I'm around.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.533
Cool. Good night.

02:29.533 --> 02:30.572
Good night.

02:37.784 --> 02:39.742
Wake up. We're in Toledo.

02:39.777 --> 02:41.155
Time to go to work.

02:43.146 --> 02:44.660
<i>Now boarding for Cleveland...</i>

02:47.699 --> 02:49.418
Okeydokey, Principal Durbin.

02:49.418 --> 02:50.917
Here are your daily announcements.

02:50.952 --> 02:52.885
- Thank you, Helen.
- You're welcome.

02:52.921 --> 02:54.721
Betty bought butter but the
butter was bitter, so Betty

02:54.756 --> 02:56.323
bought better butter to make
the bitter butter better.

02:56.358 --> 02:57.462
Ah.

02:59.094 --> 03:01.903
The Magazine Drive ends Friday.

03:03.729 --> 03:05.128
O... kay. Oh!

03:05.163 --> 03:06.986
Oh! Text from Jack.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.887
"Running late. Can you
cover for me,<i> bud?"</i>

03:10.193 --> 03:11.971
Called me bud. Helen, you gotta

03:12.064 --> 03:13.847
do the announcements
just this one time, okay?

03:13.847 --> 03:15.580
Oh, no, I can't do that.

03:15.614 --> 03:17.147
I get way too nervous.

03:17.182 --> 03:19.466
I-I was in my cousin's wedding,

03:19.491 --> 03:21.585
and if you've never fainted

03:21.620 --> 03:23.454
mouth-first onto a candle...

03:23.489 --> 03:25.088
it was a nightmare.

03:25.123 --> 03:27.217
I-I actually ate fire.

03:27.242 --> 03:29.475
No, I can't... I can't do that.

03:29.511 --> 03:31.339
Just read off the paper.
It'll be fine, okay?

03:31.339 --> 03:32.940
It'll be so easy.

03:37.679 --> 03:39.412
Jack! You look really bad.

03:39.447 --> 03:42.082
Yeah. Had a... bit of
a rough one last night.

03:42.117 --> 03:43.950
- I had a date in New York.
- Again?

03:43.986 --> 03:45.819
"Ooh, look at me. I'm Jack.

03:45.854 --> 03:47.920
I'm too good for Toledo women."

03:47.955 --> 03:49.955
Well I'm glad you understand.

03:49.991 --> 03:52.825
Look, maybe taking a bus
to New York isn't ideal,

03:52.860 --> 03:54.560
but it's worth it to date a woman

03:54.596 --> 03:56.162
who doesn't believe in angels.

03:56.197 --> 03:58.130
- They're watching over us.
- They help us.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.737
- Don't hate on an...
- You know what?

03:59.737 --> 04:01.404
Wouldn't it be easier
to just come to the bar

04:01.440 --> 04:02.844
with us tonight?

04:02.844 --> 04:04.444
Come on.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.411
Yeah, sure, maybe I should just go ahead

04:06.447 --> 04:08.547
and alienate all of my core principles

04:08.582 --> 04:10.482
and date in Toledo. While I'm at it,

04:10.517 --> 04:12.216
maybe I can eat pie on the toilet.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.652
- I've done that.
- Okay, see,

04:13.687 --> 04:15.395
- don't disrespect pie.
- That's disgusting!

04:17.791 --> 04:19.353
Good morning, Whitlock High.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.699
It's your daily announcements.

04:26.329 --> 04:28.632
<i>It's Meatloaf Day in the cafeteria.</i>

04:28.941 --> 04:30.957
There will be a vegetarian option.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.052
Too bad there's not an edible option.

04:34.981 --> 04:36.715
Oh. Thank you.

04:37.857 --> 04:40.176
<i>Creamed spinach will also be served.</i>

04:41.124 --> 04:43.487
<i>And for dessert... Violent illness.</i>

04:44.823 --> 04:46.490
<i>- Salmonella pie.</i>
- Oh!

04:47.793 --> 04:49.493
<i>The green apple two-trot.</i>

04:50.696 --> 04:52.829
That's... funny. That... Okay.

04:52.865 --> 04:54.464
And now, a special guest

04:54.500 --> 04:56.392
to make your morning announcement.

04:58.270 --> 05:00.037
<i>This is Coach Novak.</i>

05:00.071 --> 05:02.371
<i>There's gonna be
immediate suspension</i>

05:02.407 --> 05:04.672
<i>if anybody's gawking at pornography.</i>

05:04.910 --> 05:08.120
Ha ha. She's really bustin' my chops.

05:11.985 --> 05:13.952
<i>Hey, guys, this was a real kick.</i>

05:14.245 --> 05:16.046
<i>Don't tell anybody that I, you know,</i>

05:16.046 --> 05:17.346
<i>went over my... Aah!</i>

05:17.380 --> 05:19.265
Oh!

05:22.313 --> 05:24.452
Wow. I always thought announcements were...

05:24.487 --> 05:26.286
a way to impart vital information,

05:26.322 --> 05:27.886
but I guess what people like more

05:27.886 --> 05:30.186
are dumb... stupid dumb jokes.

05:30.221 --> 05:32.088
Okay, everybody, I'm here.

05:32.235 --> 05:33.534
Thank you so much for covering.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.036
I really appreciate it. You're the best.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.949
Best? The best at <i> what?</i>

05:38.390 --> 05:39.946
He is an odd little duck.

05:39.971 --> 05:41.741
- So, did you get some?
- Did I get some?

05:41.780 --> 05:43.947
Oh, my God, Heather, thank you for asking,

05:43.982 --> 05:45.515
but, no, I did not get any.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.417
I been commuting to
New York to go on dates,

05:47.453 --> 05:49.353
which is a little bit
complicated, to say the least.

05:49.388 --> 05:51.421
But now, for practical
reasons, I find myself

05:51.457 --> 05:52.689
considering dating in Toledo.

05:52.725 --> 05:54.391
Uh, at the risk of being contrary,

05:54.426 --> 05:57.078
haven't you already dated in Toledo?

05:57.543 --> 05:59.534
Doesn't your high school
ex-girlfriend live here?

05:59.559 --> 06:01.191
Oh, look. It's you.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.371
Wonderful. Good to see you, Marcus. Yes.

06:03.371 --> 06:05.183
Meredith is the exception, you know.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.064
But there's always gonna be an exception.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.566
You see, sophisticated New York women,

06:08.602 --> 06:09.868
they're really more my type.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.426
You guys know what type is, right?

06:11.475 --> 06:12.674
Victor, what's your type?

06:12.710 --> 06:14.008
- Huh?
- Your type.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.470
Who would you wanna get with?

06:15.470 --> 06:18.131
Like... if I could marry anyone?

06:18.156 --> 06:20.355
Yeah, sure, man. Whatever.

06:20.390 --> 06:21.617
Just say who it is.

06:21.617 --> 06:23.417
- I don't wanna say.
- Why not?

06:23.834 --> 06:26.034
Oh... is it something
weird? Is it like somebody

06:26.070 --> 06:27.376
- in your family?
- No!

06:27.376 --> 06:29.075
Is it a big doll? You
could just say who it is,

06:29.111 --> 06:31.111
or I could just keep guessing.
Is it your sister?

06:31.146 --> 06:33.448
- It's her.
- Oh. Cool.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.221
It's somebody who's... in the room.

06:35.253 --> 06:36.560
That's great. We can follow up.

06:36.595 --> 06:38.337
Grace, do you like Victor?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.132
No! That's too bad.

06:41.169 --> 06:42.634
But you know what, it's gotta feel good

06:42.670 --> 06:44.070
to get that off your chest, clear that up.

06:44.105 --> 06:45.504
All right, guys. Good job, everybody.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.484
See ya tomorrow. Grace...

06:47.842 --> 06:49.001
Good job today.

06:49.001 --> 06:50.242
Success!

06:57.375 --> 06:59.675
Oh, look who showed up.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.310
Yeah, well, it was either this

07:01.353 --> 07:03.755
or a 15-hour bus ride to Long Island,

07:03.780 --> 07:05.213
so... it was a toss-up.

07:05.238 --> 07:07.238
Mm-hmm. What the hell are you wearing?

07:07.621 --> 07:09.410
I'm sorry... did you
just come back from court?

07:09.410 --> 07:12.044
Yes. And the judge ruled I look awesome.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.179
Ah!

07:13.214 --> 07:14.861
Well, we're glad you came.

07:14.861 --> 07:16.315
- What are you guys drinkin'?
- Oh, I'm not.

07:16.350 --> 07:17.750
You don't wanna see me drink.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.319
I get really emotional
and clean out my purse.

07:20.354 --> 07:21.887
- It's nuts.
- Oh, well, that was

07:21.923 --> 07:23.322
a long way around "no, thank you."

07:23.357 --> 07:25.837
- Yeah, she does that.
- So, Jack,

07:25.862 --> 07:27.416
here's what we're talking about.

07:27.450 --> 07:30.252
Now, I'm looking to catch
a financially stable man

07:30.288 --> 07:33.323
for a casual yet respectable situationship.

07:33.331 --> 07:34.864
- Hmm.
- And Mary over here

07:34.889 --> 07:36.413
is looking for a scuzzy little liar.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.889
Oh, you always hated Mark.

07:37.924 --> 07:40.094
Well, he stole your computer.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.691
- He's fixing the <i> viruses.</i>
- No, he's not.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.296
I'll tell you what kind of guy I like.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.332
My husband Keith. He's so good to me.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.021
He planted me a secret garden.

07:49.046 --> 07:51.547
I don't know what's in
there. I think it's tomatoes!

07:51.582 --> 07:53.515
- Ha ha ha ha.
- So what are you

07:53.551 --> 07:55.025
- looking for, Jack?
- Well...

07:55.603 --> 07:57.519
this one over by the bar
seems acceptable to me.

07:57.555 --> 07:59.353
- Oh, she's acceptable.
- Oh, yes.

07:59.389 --> 08:00.956
- She will serve my needs nicely.
- Her parents must be so proud.

08:00.991 --> 08:03.195
Stop it, I mean, no, she's... she's cute.

08:03.195 --> 08:04.394
That's our yoga teacher Vicky.

08:04.430 --> 08:06.062
- Ah.
- Okay, we'll go grease

08:06.098 --> 08:08.053
the runway, but you have to land the plane.

08:08.053 --> 08:09.471
Uh... I think I got it.

08:09.496 --> 08:11.014
Okay...

08:11.665 --> 08:12.653
Yeah.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.784
I, uh...

08:15.728 --> 08:17.729
had sex with the Head of Women's Studies,

08:18.061 --> 08:19.977
so I think I can handle Yoga Vicky, right?

08:20.525 --> 08:21.488
Ah...

08:21.577 --> 08:23.526
This is who we were talking about.

08:23.562 --> 08:25.662
Jack is so smart

08:25.697 --> 08:27.896
and has so many sweaters...

08:27.896 --> 08:30.296
So, Jack, we're gonna
go grab another drink.

08:30.332 --> 08:32.698
Will you keep our friend Vicky company?

08:32.734 --> 08:34.298
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

08:34.577 --> 08:36.010
Hi, Jack. Nice to meet you.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.543
Hi. It's nice to meet you too.

08:37.578 --> 08:39.544
It's, uh... always nice to meet new people.

08:39.581 --> 08:42.052
I just moved here from Cambridge.

08:42.077 --> 08:43.554
That's where Harvard is.

08:43.758 --> 08:45.199
I taught there. At Harvard.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.162
I was a philosophy professor, so...

08:49.051 --> 08:50.683
- Okay.
- At Harvard.

08:50.918 --> 08:53.329
It's a prestigious
university in the Northeast.

08:53.329 --> 08:54.387
I know.

08:54.898 --> 08:56.630
Oh... I have a work emergency.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.066
Oh, a yoga emergency?

08:58.384 --> 08:59.616
Michelle told me where you work.

08:59.651 --> 09:01.386
Well, then you know what this is.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.284
Morning, boss!

09:13.319 --> 09:14.802
Want a little touch-up before we...

09:17.427 --> 09:19.156
Dennis, roll it.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.465
I got a new take.

09:20.757 --> 09:21.889
Okay...

09:21.925 --> 09:23.792
Ahh. Yeah.

09:24.194 --> 09:27.008
Good mornin', Whitlock High!

09:27.008 --> 09:29.775
<i>Here's the morning
announcements in your face!</i>

09:29.811 --> 09:31.063
<i>Ooh!</i>

09:31.063 --> 09:33.171
<i>Guess what's for lunch today. Pizza!</i>

09:33.262 --> 09:35.449
<i>With a side order of hepatitis A.</i>

09:35.474 --> 09:37.359
<i>Ha ha. Cafeteria food.</i>

09:37.676 --> 09:39.009
<i>Sucks! Right?</i>

09:39.044 --> 09:40.643
<i>You know who else has hepatitis A?</i>

09:40.679 --> 09:42.169
<i>Jeremy Jones.</i>

09:44.716 --> 09:46.924
<i>Jeremy will be spending</i>

09:47.458 --> 09:49.247
<i>some time at Children's Hospital,</i>

09:49.247 --> 09:51.847
so everybody sign the big card.

09:52.183 --> 09:53.562
We love you, Jeremy.

09:53.562 --> 09:57.531
<i>Oh! My God, a huge
celebrity just dropped by.</i>

09:59.169 --> 10:00.568
<i>Yo, whazzup?</i>

10:00.603 --> 10:02.708
<i>It's Snoop Da-zoggy Dogg!</i>

10:02.938 --> 10:04.405
<i>Get your tickets</i>

10:04.440 --> 10:06.006
- <i>to the Sadie Hawkins dance.</i>
- What?

10:06.042 --> 10:07.479
I think that's blackface.

10:07.504 --> 10:08.589
<i>Ah, l...</i>

10:11.370 --> 10:12.737
What ya thinkin', chief?

10:13.298 --> 10:15.272
Uh, thanks for asking. I don't know.

10:15.307 --> 10:17.942
I don't know. Last
night, I opened myself up

10:17.977 --> 10:19.209
to dating Toledo women.

10:19.245 --> 10:20.321
You clean up?

10:20.330 --> 10:22.120
One would think.

10:22.145 --> 10:23.642
Uh, no, you know what? I...

10:24.506 --> 10:25.981
I came up empty all night.

10:26.243 --> 10:28.210
You know, I have devoted my entire life

10:28.245 --> 10:30.813
to studying logic and reason, but this...

10:31.174 --> 10:33.946
this night made me
question everything. Truly.

10:33.946 --> 10:35.150
I-I-I
just...

10:35.186 --> 10:36.781
I don't know what... went wrong.

10:37.382 --> 10:38.771
You probably talked about Harvard

10:38.772 --> 10:40.852
- and philosophy too much.
- Sarika...

10:42.362 --> 10:44.161
you may have stumbled onto something there.

10:44.196 --> 10:46.764
Mm-hmm. You're saying that
it was too in their face

10:46.799 --> 10:48.079
how much better I was than them.

10:48.079 --> 10:49.378
That... wasn't really

10:49.412 --> 10:51.046
- what I...
- A preemptive self-rejection.

10:51.081 --> 10:52.781
An interesting concept,
and I think we should

10:52.816 --> 10:54.315
get it on its feet. Victor.

10:54.351 --> 10:55.750
Please, no more...

10:55.785 --> 10:57.118
Is that why you've never confessed

10:57.153 --> 10:58.753
your secret crush on Grace?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.655
Because you're afraid that
she's going to reject you.

11:00.690 --> 11:01.922
You think that you are beneath her.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.179
Please wake up.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.337
- Please wake up.
- Grace, do you think

11:04.367 --> 11:06.273
you could ever be into Victor?

11:06.327 --> 11:08.836
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't want to say.

11:08.871 --> 11:10.504
Oh. You don't wanna say.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.440
Maybe it's you that's into weird stuff.

11:12.475 --> 11:15.142
- Maybe I should start guessing...
- I have a secret boyfriend.

11:15.177 --> 11:17.110
- Is it me?
- It's not a secret

11:17.146 --> 11:18.345
- to the boyfriend.
- Okay, this is good.

11:18.380 --> 11:20.180
Yeah, no, okay, so, um,

11:20.215 --> 11:22.149
Grace, who is the lucky guy?

11:23.691 --> 11:24.667
It's Marcus.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.034
My best friend?

11:28.886 --> 11:31.621
Okay. Well, this has been a
surprisingly productive class.

11:31.621 --> 11:33.487
Thank you, Grace. Thank you, Victor.

11:33.524 --> 11:35.490
This has been very helpful for me.

11:36.170 --> 11:37.158
Good work.

11:37.627 --> 11:39.194
Did you make that at home?

11:39.230 --> 11:40.495
- Yeah, girl.
- I might have to

11:40.530 --> 11:42.264
- sneak in there.
- Hey, guys. Okay,

11:42.299 --> 11:44.315
so I think you were right.
I misplayed it last night.

11:44.315 --> 11:45.414
Oh... ya think?

11:45.449 --> 11:47.436
I get it, I get it. I hashed
it out with my students,

11:47.461 --> 11:49.561
and I realized with my Harvard pedigree,

11:49.953 --> 11:52.287
I was like a Grace in
a bar full of Victors.

11:52.323 --> 11:54.556
But I get it now. Let's get back in there

11:54.557 --> 11:56.279
and let's get after it. I
need you guys to wing me.

11:56.279 --> 11:58.713
- Let's go.
- You gonna take our advice?

11:58.749 --> 11:59.670
Yes!

12:00.511 --> 12:01.644
What was it again?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.546
Just... be normal.

12:03.581 --> 12:06.388
Right. Just... <i>normal.</i>

12:06.951 --> 12:08.170
Why are you saying it weird?

12:08.170 --> 12:10.003
Jack, it's "nermal." Oh, my God,

12:10.038 --> 12:11.638
now I can't say it either.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.691
Sorry, Jack, it's a no.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.192
How 'bout this. I'll buy drinks all night.

12:15.227 --> 12:16.526
- Good answer!
- Here we go.

12:16.562 --> 12:18.103
- Good answer, good answer.
- <i>Normal.</i>

12:18.330 --> 12:20.465
Thank God I got it back.

12:20.768 --> 12:21.770
Whew!

12:24.661 --> 12:26.436
Ooh. Now, there's a sturdy one,

12:26.472 --> 12:29.473
looking like he could
mow his lawn in a tornado.

12:29.508 --> 12:30.742
Well, you better give it up

12:30.742 --> 12:32.008
for these pear-shaped men

12:32.043 --> 12:33.523
- lookin' just like they mamas.
- Mmm...

12:33.524 --> 12:35.224
Hey, hey. What do you guys think?

12:35.260 --> 12:36.592
- Took your advice.
- You know,

12:36.628 --> 12:38.857
mm-mm, I'm sorry, I forgot, ladies.

12:38.882 --> 12:40.616
Was our advice to make him look like

12:40.641 --> 12:43.514
a cell phone salesman from the mall kiosk?

12:43.523 --> 12:45.389
Ha ha ha ha. No, no, no.

12:45.425 --> 12:47.525
This is so the Toledo women
will not be intimidated by me.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.762
Oh, so you think this
is what's normal here?

12:49.762 --> 12:52.429
Yep. Tonight I'm just
normal old Toledo Jack.

12:52.465 --> 12:55.099
Oh, waiter? Yeah. Can I
get a plate of cheese fries

12:55.134 --> 12:56.433
and any kind of a beer

12:56.469 --> 12:58.502
that's got a landscape on the can.

12:59.272 --> 13:00.550
Let's do this!

13:04.430 --> 13:06.132
All right, guys, ready to set me up?

13:06.515 --> 13:07.747
Grease the runway?

13:07.782 --> 13:09.349
No, no, no, no, no, Toledo Jack.

13:09.385 --> 13:10.683
We wants no parts

13:10.719 --> 13:12.754
- of whatever is happening here.
- Right.

13:12.817 --> 13:14.851
But do leave your tab open... thank you.

13:14.876 --> 13:17.210
Yeah, yeah. All right, here we go.

13:17.246 --> 13:18.945
- Good luck.
- Watch him leave.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.947
Look... Look at it. Look at his belt.

13:20.982 --> 13:23.903
Ah... man. Feels good to sit down.

13:23.967 --> 13:25.089
Can I buy you a drink?

13:25.935 --> 13:28.300
Sure, I'll... I'll have another house wine.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.185
Great. Another house wine, please.

13:30.898 --> 13:32.306
Yeah, so...

13:33.705 --> 13:34.972
Isis.

13:35.488 --> 13:37.304
Don't those guys drive you nuts?

13:37.305 --> 13:38.497
You know, for me,

13:38.497 --> 13:40.364
it's like, ah, God, stop, you know?

13:40.398 --> 13:41.952
You make me sick.

13:42.786 --> 13:44.085
Yeah. Isis isn't great.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.237
Yeah. No. It's like, you know...

13:52.095 --> 13:53.228
Ahh... hey.

13:53.263 --> 13:56.061
Are you, uh, an organ donor?

13:56.152 --> 13:58.085
- Yeah, of course.
- Of course you are. Me too.

13:58.121 --> 14:00.654
I would love to be able
to... you know, donate my...

14:00.689 --> 14:02.322
I mean, I don't wanna die, but if I did,

14:02.358 --> 14:05.427
I wanna give some kid the
gift of sight, you know?

14:05.794 --> 14:07.327
Maybe I would get to see the world

14:07.363 --> 14:08.662
through a child's eyes again.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.588
Is that how it works? I don't know.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.855
I'm just some normal
guy. I don't read much.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.661
- <i>♪ I love gin juice ♪</i>
- That is funny.

14:19.696 --> 14:20.829
<i>♪ Drivin' in my car ♪</i>

14:20.864 --> 14:22.262
<i>♪ Gin juice ♪</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:26.262
Is there anything that
I can do before I go?

14:26.754 --> 14:29.583
No, uh, Helen, I think you've done enough.

14:29.807 --> 14:31.840
- Ralph, is there something...
- Could you close the door?

14:31.876 --> 14:33.742
Can you do that, Helen?
Can you close the door?

14:33.778 --> 14:35.542
Or is that too simple? Do you need to

14:35.542 --> 14:36.941
put like a fun spin on it.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.037
Or can I have. The door. Closed.

14:39.062 --> 14:41.012
Which is... all I ever... wanted?

14:43.235 --> 14:44.734
See how easy that was?

14:45.586 --> 14:46.618
- Oh, no.
- Excellent.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.004
I'm doing this!

14:48.770 --> 14:50.903
- This place sucks.
- Please.

14:50.939 --> 14:52.472
Did you think that wearing a golf shirt

14:52.507 --> 14:54.269
and talking about organ donors would work?

14:54.269 --> 14:56.069
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid

14:56.104 --> 14:57.883
you'll meet someone and like Toledo.

14:57.883 --> 15:00.524
Ooh! Michelle, comin'
through with the realness.

15:00.549 --> 15:02.549
Yes, and you know what? And
while you're "slumming" it

15:02.585 --> 15:04.351
- with the commoners...
- Here we go.

15:04.386 --> 15:06.554
You're missing out on some fabulous women.

15:06.554 --> 15:08.154
- Okay?
- Truth bomb.

15:09.330 --> 15:10.957
All right, well, thank
you for the therapy, buds,

15:10.982 --> 15:13.082
I appreciate it, but
I'm done with this place.

15:13.093 --> 15:15.327
Oh, stay! We're gonna get some fire wings

15:15.362 --> 15:17.004
and do pucker shots.

15:17.029 --> 15:18.747
Plus, Michelle is drinking,

15:18.772 --> 15:21.451
and so we might need a white
man to talk to the cops.

15:21.514 --> 15:23.146
Well, this was fun, but I think I'm gonna

15:23.181 --> 15:25.315
- close out my tab. Sorry, guys.
- Oh...

15:26.384 --> 15:28.551
Hey, can I close out, please? Thanks.

15:28.586 --> 15:30.583
Not a single imported beer.

15:30.885 --> 15:32.851
God, I forgot I'm in Garbage City.

15:32.887 --> 15:34.278
It's actually Glass City.

15:37.099 --> 15:38.532
Yeah, no thanks.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.667
I'm good. I don't need to
update my cell phone plan.

15:40.703 --> 15:42.202
Oh, no, no, these clothes...

15:42.237 --> 15:44.178
I'm doing a social experiment.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.429
I'm actually just in
town for a brief stint.

15:46.909 --> 15:48.241
I'm taking a break from Harvard.

15:48.741 --> 15:50.076
- Oh.
- Yeah, you know what?

15:50.112 --> 15:51.642
Forget that.

15:52.014 --> 15:53.157
I-I'm Jack.

15:53.157 --> 15:55.290
I take it you're not
from around here either?

15:55.325 --> 15:57.159
Chloe. From Baltimore.

15:57.194 --> 15:59.527
Yeah, I can see that you enjoy this city

15:59.562 --> 16:00.762
about as much as I do.

16:00.798 --> 16:02.030
- It's the worst.
- Yeah.

16:02.065 --> 16:03.698
Oh, don't even try getting decent sushi.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.138
- What?
- It's impossible.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.005
You know what I worry about? I worry about

16:07.040 --> 16:08.706
the doctors. I mean, if you're
actually good at surgery,

16:08.742 --> 16:10.107
what are you doing
here? I mean, how did you

16:10.143 --> 16:11.675
not move to Chicago?

16:11.710 --> 16:13.344
Well, at least the people are amazing.

16:13.379 --> 16:14.778
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, right? I mean

16:14.813 --> 16:16.747
like that guy over there
with his gut hanging out?

16:16.782 --> 16:19.107
He just invited me to his
summer home in Provence.

16:19.107 --> 16:20.918
- Oh! You gonna go?
- Oh, I have to.

16:20.953 --> 16:22.453
- I think you should.
- How do you turn that down?

16:22.488 --> 16:24.621
Check this out. See da Vinci over there?

16:24.657 --> 16:26.456
Yeah, he just invited me to check out

16:26.491 --> 16:27.925
this crazy new invention

16:27.960 --> 16:29.964
that he's never even tried called "a fork."

16:30.596 --> 16:32.149
We shouldn't be too hard on this place.

16:32.227 --> 16:34.130
- No.
- Right? I mean, after all,

16:34.166 --> 16:36.266
there is a table of
scientists right over there.

16:36.301 --> 16:37.853
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:38.282 --> 16:40.149
Ugh! They're brilliant.

16:40.184 --> 16:42.350
Booyah! These shots are
not gonna drink themselves.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.987
Hey, you wanna get outta here

16:46.022 --> 16:47.922
before the dumb rubs off on us?

16:49.459 --> 16:50.702
Uh, uh...

16:52.031 --> 16:53.261
I think they're just having fun.

16:53.890 --> 16:55.263
And, uh, actually,

16:55.909 --> 16:57.061
they're friends of mine.

16:57.061 --> 16:59.061
Right! My friend is here too.

16:59.096 --> 17:00.662
Right over there. She's the lady

17:00.697 --> 17:02.219
that brought her newborn to the bar.

17:02.533 --> 17:03.932
Busties!

17:03.967 --> 17:05.867
Yeah, first of all, you really know

17:05.903 --> 17:06.950
how to run a joke into the ground.

17:06.951 --> 17:08.473
Secondly, I wasn't kidding.

17:08.473 --> 17:09.901
They really are friends of mine.

17:10.142 --> 17:12.076
You know what? No. I'm
gonna keep this open.

17:12.111 --> 17:14.077
Can I get three blue pucker shots, please?

17:14.702 --> 17:17.833
Uh, actually... make it four.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.295
Also...

17:19.329 --> 17:21.731
Baltimore... It's a third-rate city.

17:21.767 --> 17:25.017
It sucks. And you have dead
women buried in your parks.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.825
- Ladies, some shots.
- Hey!

17:29.861 --> 17:32.060
It looks like you were making
it happen with that one.

17:32.095 --> 17:33.495
What'd you mess up this time?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.330
Who knows? But it looked like you guys

17:35.366 --> 17:37.165
were having more fun over
here, so I figured I join you

17:37.200 --> 17:38.300
- and stay.
- Okay!

17:38.335 --> 17:40.058
- All right!
- Hey, hey!

17:41.037 --> 17:42.245
- Mm.
- Yeah!

17:42.329 --> 17:43.599
Tornado Dance!

17:43.974 --> 17:45.507
- Yeah...
- Uh...

17:45.542 --> 17:46.659
excuse you?

17:47.177 --> 17:48.509
- Yeah?
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:48.544 --> 17:50.511
Sorry. Sorry, that's on us.

17:50.546 --> 17:52.147
It's not worth it, girl, it's not worth it.

17:52.182 --> 17:53.316
Walk away.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.101
Oops. It looks like there's
a little lighting issue.

18:05.136 --> 18:07.207
There's a shadow. You want me to fix that?

18:07.207 --> 18:08.940
Yeah, sure, Helen. Why don't you just

18:08.975 --> 18:11.809
- take over the whole production?
- I can't take this anymore!

18:11.845 --> 18:13.510
What is this about, Ralph?

18:14.419 --> 18:15.873
Dennis, a moment.

18:17.268 --> 18:19.135
You really don't know
what this is about, do you?

18:19.515 --> 18:20.879
Morning announcements were my chance

18:20.884 --> 18:22.094
to be the cool guy,

18:22.119 --> 18:23.352
to connect with the students,

18:23.387 --> 18:25.007
and you took them from me!

18:25.067 --> 18:28.568
Oh, Ralph, why would I ever
do anything to hurt you?

18:28.787 --> 18:30.683
<i>You pulled me up from the gutter.</i>

18:30.683 --> 18:31.848
<i>You're an amazing man.</i>

18:31.884 --> 18:34.185
<i>I would never take the
announcements from you.</i>

18:34.210 --> 18:36.819
<i>Well, it's too late.
I'm awake now, Helen.</i>

18:36.828 --> 18:38.428
<i>I thought I had this game cornered,</i>

18:38.464 --> 18:39.601
<i>then you came in and did it in a way</i>

18:39.601 --> 18:41.198
<i>that I didn't know what possible!</i>

18:41.570 --> 18:43.055
<i>- I'm a fraud.
- No.</i>

18:43.405 --> 18:46.820
<i>- You should do them!
- Oh! I should do them.</i>

18:46.859 --> 18:50.226
<i>Ha! You think that's
what people want?</i>

18:50.262 --> 18:53.622
<i>Me runnin' around
like a big, dumb goof?</i>

18:54.614 --> 18:57.801
<i>I do that crap for my
nephew, and he's five.</i>

18:58.109 --> 18:59.938
<i>Forever, if you know what I mean.</i>

19:01.331 --> 19:03.140
<i>Holy crap. Is that thing on?</i>

19:03.175 --> 19:04.174
<i>Oh...</i>

19:07.446 --> 19:09.679
I don't understand what they see in you.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.387
Well... this is fun!

19:17.422 --> 19:19.022
Who, uh, who started all this?

19:19.057 --> 19:20.490
- You!
- Me?

19:20.526 --> 19:22.224
Well, this is already awesome.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.860
- Explain.
- When you revealed

19:23.895 --> 19:25.427
that Victor liked Grace, we also found out

19:25.463 --> 19:27.329
she had a secret boyfriend, Marcus.

19:27.365 --> 19:28.564
But she was actually protecting

19:28.599 --> 19:30.066
her real secret boyfriend, Devin,

19:30.101 --> 19:32.568
not realizing Marcus is
secretly dating Sarika,

19:32.603 --> 19:33.936
who got super-jealous.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.039
So Sarika decided to revenge-date Devin.

19:36.074 --> 19:38.774
But Devin is fluid, so
he may actually like me.

19:38.809 --> 19:40.676
And unrelatedly, Colin lost his retainer

19:40.711 --> 19:42.178
and is afraid to tell his mom,

19:42.213 --> 19:44.680
and no one is talking to
anyone, a-and we're drowning!

19:45.033 --> 19:46.883
Colin, you need to just tell your mom.

19:46.917 --> 19:49.051
Okay, hey, guys, guys, guys.

19:49.086 --> 19:51.960
Wow! You are being far too dramatic.

19:52.394 --> 19:54.790
I mean, don't you realize how meaningless

19:54.825 --> 19:56.391
these little teenage crushes are?

19:56.426 --> 19:59.594
Come on, only adult romances
actually mean anything.

19:59.905 --> 20:01.472
Look, the point is, you should

20:01.507 --> 20:03.407
all just be focused on your friendships.

20:03.443 --> 20:06.101
Don't worry about all
this petty dating stuff.

20:06.412 --> 20:08.346
Okay? You should all be
downing shots together

20:08.381 --> 20:11.872
and doing dances based on
natural disasters, you know?

20:12.365 --> 20:14.499
Leave all this other crap behind, you know?

20:14.534 --> 20:17.829
Otherwise, you're just gonna be
stuck in Toledo goin' it alone.

20:18.449 --> 20:20.581
Look, you're gonna have your whole lives

20:20.581 --> 20:22.681
to worry about dating, 'kay?

20:22.717 --> 20:24.049
Right now, honestly, you should probably

20:24.085 --> 20:25.970
just be focused on masturbating.

20:26.093 --> 20:27.495
You guys all masturbate, right?

20:28.612 --> 20:29.674
Yeah?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.036
Show of hands real quick.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.740
Oh, no...

20:36.068 --> 20:38.238
Yeah, that's tough. That's tough.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.669
I noticed you weren't entangled

20:47.704 --> 20:49.337
in any of the love triangles.

20:49.363 --> 20:51.199
You prefer to stay above the fray.

20:51.488 --> 20:52.979
I don't mess with this kid stuff.

20:54.522 --> 20:56.091
I'm looking for a real woman.

21:02.536 --> 21:03.999
Oh, [BLEEP].
