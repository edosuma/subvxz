01:41.768 --> 01:45.147
I was prey
for nearly two decades of my life.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.777
A throwaway child. A discard.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.280
A throwaway child. A discard.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.698
Discard.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.868
I had to fend for myself.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.662
Against the elements.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.666
Against other people. Against myself.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.422
My demons.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.138
I'd like to thank our guest today,
journalist Poppy Parnell,

03:41.221 --> 03:43.682
host of the smash-hit podcast,
Reconsidered.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.144
Poppy, one last question.
What's up next for you?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
How do you follow up
the Warren Cave season?

03:49.813 --> 03:55.652
Well, doing the Warren Cave story
came at a huge personal cost for me.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.280
So, I'm just gonna take my time

03:58.363 --> 04:01.450
and be very thoughtful about
the next story I choose to take on.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.411
Well, don't pull a Lauryn Hill on us
and keep us waiting, Poppy.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.996
We want a new season now.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.957
But you all heard it. A little bit longer.
Thanks again for joining us.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.334
Well, thank you for having me.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.058
Hey, Poppy.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.060
-Hey, Herbie.
-The usual?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.521
-Always. Hey.
-All right.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.067
Surprise!

04:40.364 --> 04:41.657
Yep, we got her.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.617
Hi.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.119
-Hey.
-So good to see you.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.955
It's so good to see you.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.834
-You look beautiful.
-You look gorgeous.

04:53.961 --> 04:54.962
Beat that.

04:55.045 --> 04:59.299
I almost got you there.
Then I really got you there.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.592
Come on.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.845
-That's right. I don't know what to say.
-Goddamn.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.555
-Thank you.
-Come on.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.848
You still cheating.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.100
Daddy, you can't say that.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.393
-Course I can.
-Come on.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.854
She stole from me the first day
she came into this bar.

05:11.937 --> 05:15.691
Grimy little hands right in that till
and slipped off before I could catch her.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.694
Only got a block until these two
cornered me in the alley.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.279
So then y'all jumped her?

05:20.362 --> 05:21.572
We sure did.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.323
But she was feral,
so we had to work at it.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.411
We tussled and threw trash at each other

05:27.494 --> 05:29.329
until you couldn't tell one of us
from the next.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.749
All three of them came back
smelling like fresh hell.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.501
What were y'all? Ten, 11 years old?

05:36.086 --> 05:37.129
Yeah.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.840
World-famous author.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.718
Been a long time since we've seen you.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.388
Well, I spend more time
in hotel rooms than my own bed.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.934
Hate that all those years in the streets,
you never thought to come here.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.105
To us.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.650
You over here cheating?

05:58.734 --> 06:02.279
Oh, my God!
I'm never gonna live that down.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.073
-Nope.
-Never. Looking like new money.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.325
Hi, hi.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.916
All right, come on.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.890
Can y'all believe
we're back together again?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.533
I'm sorry I wasn't here for you
when things got crazy.

06:48.659 --> 06:51.078
You called, and you wrote,
and that was all I needed.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.163
And I survived.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.500
That's what we do, hon. We survive.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.335
Makes us stronger.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.463
It's what they sold us.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.926
Ingram? Is he coming tomorrow?

07:06.844 --> 07:07.845
One hopes.

07:08.345 --> 07:12.850
It's still a little tricky, but we're just
trying to remember the romance.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.811
Sounds kind of nice, actually.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.273
And Josh? He'll be there?

07:19.982 --> 07:22.192
Of course.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.152
Why wouldn't he?

07:31.869 --> 07:33.871
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.264
I am so happy to see you both.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.183
Together.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.981
-Yay.
-I'm gonna get us some drinks.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.275
-Okay.
-Yeah. Okay. Hey, come with me.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.157
Wait.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.700
Is that...

08:12.409 --> 08:15.662
This is the very first draft
of the Discard manuscript.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.247
Complete with your editing notes.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.542
This wouldn't have happened without you.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.588
It gave me chills
the first time I read it.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.674
You've come a long way
since you sat next to me on that bus.

08:27.758 --> 08:31.845
Those two little girls
are never far enough away, are they?

08:31.929 --> 08:34.389
No, but the world
does not need to know that.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.433
Excuse me.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.393
Hey, so some
of the scholarship kids are here.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.063
-Would you come meet them?
-Okay, yeah-- yeah. But first...

08:41.145 --> 08:43.440
This is Ivy Abbott.
She's my second here at Shelter,

08:43.524 --> 08:46.068
and I don't know what I'd do without her.

08:46.777 --> 08:47.945
Ivy, this is Poppy.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.738
Very, very nice to meet you.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.822
Nice to meet you.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.367
Would you mind if I steal Micah away
for just one moment?

08:53.450 --> 08:55.285
-Not at all.
-Perfect.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.370
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.872
Wow.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.552
Quite the turnout, huh?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.556
Josh. Oh, my God.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.015
Come here.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.684
I missed you.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.019
I missed you too.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.314
Wow.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.318
The two of you have become
quite the power couple.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.696
Micah is world-famous

09:30.779 --> 09:34.074
and your documentary
about the Sons of Ivar is everywhere.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.286
Who knew it would lead to all this?

09:38.996 --> 09:40.080
Who knew?

09:42.207 --> 09:43.375
What's going on?

09:45.002 --> 09:46.295
You all right?

09:49.798 --> 09:50.966
What does that mean?

09:52.384 --> 09:56.180
Don't mind me. I have Mother Russia
coursing through my body.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.267
You know, fatalism and-- and angst.
They run in my blood.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.895
You know you can tell me anything.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.773
Come by the studio later. We'll talk then.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.610
This will all end at some point, right?

10:11.653 --> 10:17.492
Micah's memoir, Discard, shared
her story in such excruciating detail.

10:18.410 --> 10:23.081
Her pain reached millions,
and it inspired just as many.

10:24.708 --> 10:29.087
And now without further delay,
the woman of the hour, Micah Keith.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.801
Good evening.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.847
That is a terrified young girl in there.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.645
Thirteen years old.
Left to survive on her own.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.732
Forgotten. A discard.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.945
And still survived.

10:53.487 --> 10:57.741
When I first saw this installation,
I took to my bed for three days.

10:57.824 --> 11:02.538
I just had such a hard time
looking at her. At me.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.666
All these years later.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.295
I stole. I cheated. I fought.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.297
I drank.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.258
I did drugs.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.761
My body was taken.
Not always with my permission.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.598
And that made her nothing.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.141
That made me nothing.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.772
And so, I wrote myself into existence.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.733
To keep from disappearing.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.532
The goal here tonight is to make sure

11:38.615 --> 11:44.580
that every discarded young person
has a truly safe home

11:44.663 --> 11:49.960
and not just that safe place
in their imagination.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.548
Thank you.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.679
Thank you. Thank you.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.893
So before I go, I once again
want to thank the Ryvlin Gallery,

12:05.976 --> 12:08.937
my publishers, Simon & Schuster,

12:09.021 --> 12:12.983
my incredible staff at Shelter, all over,

12:13.066 --> 12:18.655
and my friend, Poppy Parnell,
who set me on this path.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.826
She saw my collection of scribbles
and recognized them as something more.

12:22.910 --> 12:27.664
And her bone-deep belief
in what I could offer the world

12:28.248 --> 12:30.459
was one of the cornerstones of my success.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.506
And then, of course, last but never least,
my husband, Josh.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.216
Josh, where are you?

12:38.509 --> 12:39.885
Honey?

12:43.680 --> 12:48.101
Anyway, he knows how much
he means to me, and I thank him truly.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.313
And all of you, enjoy.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.277
You know, every state I was in,
every place I visited,

12:57.361 --> 12:59.279
people were talking about your podcast.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.949
That's nice to hear.

13:02.032 --> 13:06.036
Because I've been accused
of single-handedly destroying journalism.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.958
You know, all I've ever wanted to do
was help people,

13:11.041 --> 13:13.001
and I get hate mail all the time.

13:13.836 --> 13:18.590
"Fraud." "Opportunist." "Exploiter."

13:19.132 --> 13:20.926
My personal favorite, "witch."

13:22.845 --> 13:24.388
You made an impact.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.557
And that always makes waves.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.144
Is Josh okay?

13:31.728 --> 13:34.022
He seemed kind of off at the gallery.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.609
Growing pains, you know?

13:38.402 --> 13:43.699
Shelter just took off this past year,
and I think that we're just adjusting.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.082
Wow.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.756
All right.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.345
Josh?

14:09.141 --> 14:10.142
Josh?

14:10.893 --> 14:11.894
Hello?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.480
Maybe he went home.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.734
Well, he's not answering his phone.
I'm gonna check the back patio.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.486
-Where's your bathroom?
-Over the bridge.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.406
And then you kind of go to the left.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.490
Okay.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.786
If you want anything, get it. Wine, beer.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.871
Thank you.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.789
Whatever you want, okay?

14:33.457 --> 14:34.499
Hey, Josh?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.030
Josh?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.655
-Poppy?
-Ingram!

15:48.448 --> 15:49.950
Ingram!

15:50.742 --> 15:52.369
-Poppy!
-Oh, my God.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.745
-Poppy.
-Oh, my God.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.623
-You okay?
-It's Josh.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.418
It's Josh. It's Josh. It's Josh.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.381
Poppy?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.426
-Micah.
-What's wrong?

16:07.509 --> 16:08.677
What? What?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.179
-Honey. Stop.
-What?

16:11.138 --> 16:12.514
-What is it?
-You don't want to see this.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.224
-Don't want to see what?
-You don't want to see this.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.559
-Poppy.
-Don't--

16:18.812 --> 16:19.980
Oh, my God.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.091
That's pretty much it.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.427
Thank you.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.437
You okay, babe?

17:01.605 --> 17:03.815
-No.
-You found the body.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.693
You are?

17:07.778 --> 17:10.113
You got blood on your jacket there.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.367
And you are?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.119
Inspector Aames.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.499
Don't ask me why the SFPD
doesn't use detective.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.712
Well, we gave our statement to your
colleague. I'm sure he can fill you in.

17:25.796 --> 17:28.173
I prefer to hear a story
the second time it's told.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.094
I'm gonna check on Micah.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.178
Yeah.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.180
It's Poppy, right?

17:36.390 --> 17:37.891
You're not recording, are you?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.646
How long did you know Joshua?

17:44.189 --> 17:45.649
Twenty years.

17:47.943 --> 17:51.280
So, what do you think
of his latest documentary, Drengir?

17:51.363 --> 17:53.991
What in the world does that
have to do with anything?

17:54.074 --> 17:56.660
He made a film
that pissed off the Sons of Ivar.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.912
It may be a straight line
from point A to point B.

17:58.996 --> 18:01.748
That's your story? That fast?

18:01.832 --> 18:03.208
What's yours?

18:07.713 --> 18:09.173
I'm gonna check on Micah.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.928
Hey, honey.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.266
He was just here.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.020
Then he's gone.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.647
Can we please take her home?

18:27.733 --> 18:30.277
Yeah, we'll let you know
if we have any other information.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.362
Can I have a lock of his hair?

18:37.451 --> 18:38.744
I'll see what I can do.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.539
Thank you.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.251
I'll walk her to her car.

19:06.772 --> 19:07.940
I'm staying the night.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.275
Thank you.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.700
Who was that boy with Josh?

19:20.744 --> 19:22.246
Was he cheating on Micah?

19:24.373 --> 19:25.541
It's not like him.

19:25.624 --> 19:27.876
If he didn't love her anymore,
he'd just leave.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.294
You don't know that, baby.

19:29.378 --> 19:30.420
I know my friends.

19:30.504 --> 19:34.383
We know what our friends
want us to know about their marriages,

19:34.466 --> 19:35.551
and that's all.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.427
Ingram.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.436
Thanks.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.885
People have been coming
on my property all night.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.262
I don't want them multiplying
like roaches.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.848
Can you do anything about it?

20:22.931 --> 20:24.725
Micah's had issues in the past
with a stalker.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.560
Wait, what? Since when?

20:26.643 --> 20:28.061
No. It's nothing.

20:29.479 --> 20:33.400
It's just a sad woman
who identified too much with my books.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.152
She's not the only one.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.446
And you are?

20:37.529 --> 20:39.656
Ramon. Micah's assistant.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.200
-Anything else?
-No.

20:42.951 --> 20:43.952
No.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.039
My fans, they can-- they can be intense,

20:47.122 --> 20:49.166
but I-- I couldn't imagine...

20:50.918 --> 20:54.129
Okay. There's nothing we can do
about the road beyond the gate.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.964
It's public property.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.634
But we'll go ahead and leave a car
out front for the next 48 hours.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.136
-Okay. Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.062
Look.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.315
You need private security.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.986
I don't want any more strangers around me.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.031
He's not a stranger.

21:41.718 --> 21:42.970
What can I do for you gentlemen?

21:43.637 --> 21:45.013
Let me see some ID.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.851
Listen, my name is Markus Killebrew.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.979
I was OPD up until about
three years ago. Area five.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.650
Don't make me repeat myself, son.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.194
Let me see some ID.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.071
Son?

22:02.614 --> 22:03.782
Hey, what's going on?

22:04.575 --> 22:06.785
Look at me. Babe. Baby.

22:06.869 --> 22:08.495
Baby, look-- look at me. Look at me.

22:08.579 --> 22:10.414
Don't you give them a reason.
You stay right here with me.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.875
Trini's already on the phone
with Yates, all right?

22:12.958 --> 22:14.418
My name is Zarina Killebrew.

22:14.501 --> 22:18.964
I'm a neonatal nurse at Alta Bates,
and this is my husband, Markus Killebrew.

22:19.590 --> 22:21.049
He was OPD for 12 years.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.594
Currently,
owner of a private security firm.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.345
And this is our home.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.600
Our daughter is inside
filming this interaction,

22:29.683 --> 22:33.478
and she's also on the phone
with our neighbor, Detective Yates.

22:50.162 --> 22:54.499
Why do we have to give these motherfuckers
everything but a blood sample

22:54.583 --> 22:57.336
before they recognize
that I'm a goddamn man, huh?

22:58.337 --> 23:02.007
See, this is what I'm talking about.
They done fucked off my whole mood.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.717
Come on. Come on.

23:10.349 --> 23:13.435
-I'm good. All right? Yeah.
-Yeah? Yeah?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.355
So, don't you have a shift to go to?

23:17.606 --> 23:18.690
Huh?

23:18.774 --> 23:20.275
Well, you better get going.

23:20.359 --> 23:22.611
Because I'm cool. Really.

23:22.694 --> 23:23.695
You sure?

23:23.779 --> 23:26.073
Look, it ain't like I'm not used to this.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.699
You've seen it all before.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.911
You know I love you.

23:30.994 --> 23:33.330
I love your ass too. Come here.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.505
Now go on and save some lives.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.300
-Bye, baby.
-Bye.

23:45.884 --> 23:47.052
I'll see you later.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.220
Drive safe.

24:21.712 --> 24:24.214
-So, you'll stay here with her?
-Where else would I be?

24:24.298 --> 24:26.091
I have personal business,
or I wouldn't leave.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.384
No need to explain.

24:29.219 --> 24:32.472
You don't seem overly concerned
about Josh's death.

24:32.556 --> 24:33.807
I couldn't stand him.

24:35.309 --> 24:36.727
So, why are you here?

24:37.936 --> 24:40.522
I travel the world. I make a ton of money,

24:40.606 --> 24:42.691
and I have an apartment
provided by Shelter.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.067
In Nob Hill.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.904
That's like asking me
why I need water and air.

24:52.576 --> 24:55.913
Our daughter is inside
filming this interaction,

24:55.996 --> 24:59.583
and she's also on the phone
with our neighbor, Detective Yates.

25:00.584 --> 25:02.419
Hey, do you ever miss being police?

25:02.503 --> 25:05.339
Yeah.
Especially when shit like that happens.

25:06.048 --> 25:09.718
Did it ever bother you
to arrest Black people?

25:10.302 --> 25:11.845
Yeah, all the time.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.432
No, wait, that's...

25:16.642 --> 25:17.976
That's not entirely true.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.270
You know,
I didn't have a problem arresting people

25:20.354 --> 25:21.939
who deserved to be locked up.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.567
In my mind, a criminal is a criminal.
That's it.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.907
Did you ever see people you knew?

25:32.658 --> 25:34.409
Yeah, way too many times.

25:34.493 --> 25:36.745
I grew up with a lot of knuckleheads.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.375
So, is that why you left the force?

25:43.710 --> 25:44.920
Well...

25:46.088 --> 25:50.008
Why I left the force is... complicated.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.054
Did you know the officers
that were pimping those girls?

25:55.055 --> 25:56.265
You know about that?

26:02.145 --> 26:05.274
No. I didn't,
but let me tell you something.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.567
Those men,

26:07.317 --> 26:10.487
they don't deserve
to call themselves police.

26:10.571 --> 26:13.657
Or men, for that matter.
Hear what I'm saying?

26:14.324 --> 26:17.744
-Yeah.
-They're just basic criminals and thugs.

26:17.828 --> 26:18.829
That's all.

26:19.621 --> 26:20.622
Somebody's here.

26:34.595 --> 26:35.679
It's been a long time.

26:37.222 --> 26:40.225
Since I left you without a dope beat
to step to.

26:42.811 --> 26:44.104
How you doing, Markus?

26:44.188 --> 26:45.314
I'm good, Pops.

26:47.107 --> 26:49.818
This is my daughter. Trini.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.322
Trini, this is Poppy Parnell.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.116
Nice to meet you, Trini.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.743
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too,
Miss Parnell.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.746
Hey, you helped my father
get that man out of jail, right?

27:03.832 --> 27:06.251
I helped your father.

27:08.086 --> 27:10.672
Yes. Yes, I did.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.007
I did.

27:14.426 --> 27:18.305
Hey, sweetheart, could you,
I don't know, get us something to drink?

27:18.388 --> 27:20.057
-Yeah, of course. Be right back.
-Thank you.

27:24.895 --> 27:26.021
What can I do for you?

27:28.524 --> 27:30.234
You know about the Joshua Keith murder.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.946
-Shit, here we go.
-No, not like that.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.407
You remember Mikey from when we were kids?

27:40.869 --> 27:42.663
Yeah, you're talking about that...

27:43.372 --> 27:46.458
that grimy little white girl
who used to hang around Bushrod Park.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.294
Joshua was her husband.

27:51.630 --> 27:55.133
And I know you have
a private security firm now.

27:55.217 --> 27:57.427
-Desiree--
-Desiree told you. You're right.

27:59.847 --> 28:03.058
I just want someone around her
that can be trusted.

28:08.063 --> 28:09.690
Don't look at me like that.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.294
Your very own inner sanctum.

28:31.044 --> 28:34.006
Devon with security will be by shortly
to give you access to everything.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.550
-Cool.
-Any questions?

28:38.010 --> 28:41.013
Yeah. What exactly is Shelter?

28:42.181 --> 28:44.141
A women's lifestyle brand and company.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.268
Fans think we're about
women's actualization.

28:46.351 --> 28:49.771
Seminars, workshops, therapy,
wellness products.

28:50.731 --> 28:51.732
And haters?

28:51.815 --> 28:53.525
Haters think we're a coven.

28:56.695 --> 28:58.155
This is for you.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.616
-All right.
-A mourning band for Josh.

29:00.699 --> 29:02.367
We sell them online.

29:02.451 --> 29:04.620
Micah believes it's a ritual
that should have never gone away.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.121
It both honors the dead

29:06.205 --> 29:08.290
and forces the world
to treat you with grace.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.834
Let me ask you a question.

29:10.918 --> 29:14.087
Was Josh close to the people,

29:14.171 --> 29:16.465
or as you would say,
"guests" that work here?

29:16.548 --> 29:17.799
Sometimes.

29:18.342 --> 29:21.803
When he wanted to make use
of our amenities. Or the assistants.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.973
My extension is 1637
if you need anything from me.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.359
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:36.485 --> 29:39.488
You know, we don't have to do this today.
I know you're dealing with Micah.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.158
Sorry about Joshua. He was a good man.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.077
How's she holding up?

29:45.827 --> 29:46.828
Terribly.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.624
I would've skipped the appointment,
but I pulled every string I could

29:50.707 --> 29:54.253
to get you into this clinical trial,
and we certainly can't miss the first day.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.069
I'm scared.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.491
I know, Daddy.

30:28.662 --> 30:31.123
We have to tell Lillian and the girls.

30:31.874 --> 30:35.002
You need the support,
and we all need to be able to help you.

30:35.085 --> 30:36.211
-No.
-Daddy.

30:36.295 --> 30:37.504
I said no.

30:37.588 --> 30:39.590
Well, how do you think
you're gonna be able to keep it from 'em?

30:39.673 --> 30:40.966
Especially Lillian?

30:42.217 --> 30:44.970
The second I tell her,
I'll become an old man to her.

30:45.762 --> 30:49.016
I'm not ready for her to look at me
like I'm losing my mind.

30:50.184 --> 30:51.185
Daddy.

30:51.768 --> 30:54.104
I have a beautiful young wife.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.608
I am not gonna be ridiculous to her.

30:57.691 --> 30:59.067
What does that mean?

30:59.151 --> 31:01.653
It means what it means.

31:02.654 --> 31:03.989
My terms.

31:07.242 --> 31:08.994
I don't even wanna hear it.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.288
-We're Catholic.
-And I'm a criminal.

31:13.415 --> 31:15.334
A man can be a contradiction.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.755
Lukather Shreveport Scoville?

31:33.727 --> 31:34.853
Right this way.

31:43.278 --> 31:45.948
So, we don't tell her about all of this,

31:46.031 --> 31:48.575
but maybe you could find something useful.

31:49.785 --> 31:51.036
What is it?

31:51.119 --> 31:52.496
Hate mail.

31:54.206 --> 31:55.624
Addressed to Micah.

31:57.918 --> 31:59.086
Black Jesus.

32:03.924 --> 32:04.925
Wow.

32:08.136 --> 32:09.221
Just don't hug me.

32:12.015 --> 32:14.393
And don't speak to me in a soft voice.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.020
I'll just shatter if you do.

32:19.314 --> 32:21.108
I'm here for whatever you need.

32:21.191 --> 32:23.360
How am I supposed to face everybody?

32:24.111 --> 32:26.071
Don't worry about that.

32:26.154 --> 32:28.574
Just step by step until we know.

32:28.657 --> 32:32.244
Know what? That my husband died
in the arms of another man?

32:33.662 --> 32:35.998
I mean, I'm sad, and then I'm humiliated.

32:36.623 --> 32:39.209
I'm sad, and then I'm furious.

32:39.293 --> 32:41.211
What kind of fool have I been?

32:48.302 --> 32:50.095
Did the police contact you today?

32:50.179 --> 32:53.348
Ingram told me not to talk with them
unless I had a lawyer.

32:55.767 --> 32:58.103
So I'm meeting
with a couple this afternoon.

33:00.522 --> 33:03.525
Poppy,
what did Joshua want to talk to you about?

33:06.570 --> 33:08.363
I mean, did he say anything?

33:13.160 --> 33:14.244
What?

33:14.995 --> 33:17.497
-We'll talk about it later.
-Don't treat me like glass, Poppy.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.875
I swear to God.

33:19.958 --> 33:23.128
Why didn't he show up at dinner?
Were you guys fighting?

33:24.046 --> 33:25.506
I mean, just...

33:26.507 --> 33:31.178
Just-- Just marriage sniping.
Nothing major.

33:31.261 --> 33:33.305
He was dealing with the fallout
of his doc.

33:33.847 --> 33:36.350
I was focused on the launch.

33:36.433 --> 33:37.643
We were busy.

33:37.726 --> 33:38.894
Ramon!

33:43.774 --> 33:45.317
Get rid of that phone.

33:46.151 --> 33:47.361
Of course.

33:48.070 --> 33:49.613
I canceled the rest of your week.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.573
Lachlan gave me some pushback,
but I handled it.

33:51.657 --> 33:52.658
Okay.

34:32.447 --> 34:34.283
You have to let yourself grieve.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.040
It's what I tell my girls at the seminar,
but...

34:45.168 --> 34:47.670
Right now, it means nothing to me.
Absolutely nothing.

34:54.303 --> 34:56.054
All I feel is insane.

35:08.650 --> 35:11.403
Poppy, I need you to help me find out
what happened to Joshua.

35:12.362 --> 35:15.282
-You just need to get some rest.
-No. Listen.

35:15.365 --> 35:17.743
When I was in the back of that ambulance,

35:17.826 --> 35:21.038
the officers were joking
that rent boys in the Castro were...

35:29.046 --> 35:30.047
Like...

35:31.215 --> 35:33.008
Like, playing Russian roulette.

35:36.303 --> 35:39.097
We cannot depend on them
to tell us the truth.

35:42.893 --> 35:45.771
I put myself in a lot of danger last year.

35:47.814 --> 35:51.485
Ingram, my father too,
and you know what happened with Cydie.

35:53.362 --> 35:54.988
Joshua would do it if it were you.

35:55.072 --> 35:56.573
It's not that simple.

35:57.241 --> 35:58.992
Poppy, please.

36:00.118 --> 36:01.119
Please.

36:01.203 --> 36:06.041
Seeking answers is never a straight line.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.420
I won't only find out
what you want me to know.

36:10.921 --> 36:13.340
-I don't care about that.
-But I do.

36:14.967 --> 36:16.426
I do. I-I-I...

36:19.137 --> 36:24.726
I will help you by supporting you,
but I-- I can't add to your pain. I...

36:28.438 --> 36:29.565
I'm gonna go lie down.

36:56.717 --> 36:58.218
Hey, you, what's going on?

36:58.302 --> 36:59.303
Hey.

37:00.304 --> 37:03.140
Micah asked me to look into Josh's murder.

37:08.103 --> 37:09.521
You sure you wanna do that?

37:09.605 --> 37:11.148
Well, I don't wanna hurt her.

37:12.316 --> 37:13.567
Real talk?

37:13.650 --> 37:16.987
Between this and Daddy,
I don't have anything left.

37:19.531 --> 37:22.826
Well, I could look into it,
just for peace of mind,

37:22.910 --> 37:25.746
and you could concentrate
on being a friend.

37:27.289 --> 37:28.290
Okay.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.709
But look quietly.

37:31.251 --> 37:32.336
Okay.

37:57.069 --> 37:58.111
Hey.

37:58.195 --> 37:59.446
Talked to Micah?

37:59.947 --> 38:02.783
No. What's going on, Ingram?

38:02.866 --> 38:05.577
A friend of mine at SFPD
gave me a heads-up.

38:05.661 --> 38:09.289
Police are closing the case,
classifying it as a murder-suicide.

38:09.373 --> 38:11.375
Well, who do they think did the murdering?

38:11.458 --> 38:12.876
They think Joshua did it.

38:18.048 --> 38:19.049
Shit.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.385
Twelve phone calls? Really?

38:22.219 --> 38:23.720
Murder-suicide?

38:23.804 --> 38:26.181
If that's not the laziest shit
I've ever heard.

38:26.265 --> 38:27.975
What could possibly be Josh's motive?

38:28.058 --> 38:31.687
Well, who's asking? Micah's over-involved
friend or the nosy journalist?

38:31.770 --> 38:33.522
Is the answer different for one
and not the other?

38:33.605 --> 38:34.773
Step light.

38:34.857 --> 38:36.108
I'll say the same to you.

38:36.191 --> 38:37.776
-I'm not the story.
-Could be.

38:38.694 --> 38:41.780
-Now, what does that mean?
-It means do your fucking job.

38:42.364 --> 38:43.407
And we're done.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.410
I'll give you one more chance.

38:46.493 --> 38:47.828
Or what?

38:47.911 --> 38:49.621
Or I'll investigate this.

38:49.705 --> 38:53.458
Then you and your whole department
will come out looking like fools.

38:54.626 --> 38:57.713
You saw the same thing I did.
You just don't wanna face it.

38:58.463 --> 39:01.300
He was shirtless in the arms
of a much younger man.

39:01.383 --> 39:03.385
There's evidence
that was not their first encounter.

39:03.468 --> 39:06.180
No forced entry, nothing missing.
Should I go on?

39:06.263 --> 39:07.472
Yes, you should.

39:08.015 --> 39:09.516
What about Micah's stalker?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.643
What about all the hate mail
in her office?

39:11.727 --> 39:14.938
What about the Sons of-- of-- of Ivar,
or whatever the hell their name is?

39:15.022 --> 39:16.648
From what I've read, they're dangerous.

39:16.732 --> 39:18.192
Well, then you should wanna stay away.

39:18.275 --> 39:20.819
You don't want them
turning their sights on you.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.616
If you know this,
how can you rule them out?

39:26.575 --> 39:28.368
How the hell do you even keep your job?

39:32.789 --> 39:35.459
You know I trained under Owen Cave?

39:35.542 --> 39:36.710
So?

39:37.252 --> 39:40.130
-So you've ruined him.
-He ruined himself.

39:40.714 --> 39:43.842
Poppy Parnell.
Judge, jury, executioner, right?

39:44.593 --> 39:47.054
Whoever you're gunning
to destroy this time, it won't be me.

39:47.137 --> 39:50.307
You'll destroy yourself
if you don't dig a little deeper.

41:03.505 --> 41:04.548
Hey.

41:05.716 --> 41:06.884
They closed the case.

41:08.594 --> 41:09.678
I know.

41:16.018 --> 41:17.102
Where are you?

41:19.605 --> 41:21.565
Just my old stomping grounds.

41:23.609 --> 41:26.111
That's not the answer. You know that.

41:27.112 --> 41:31.658
What did my daddy say to you?
"You can always come to us."

41:31.742 --> 41:34.369
Come to me, honey. Just come to me.

42:24.419 --> 42:25.629
You need anything?

42:27.047 --> 42:30.050
No, I'm just doing the work.

42:30.676 --> 42:31.844
Affirmations.

42:34.346 --> 42:35.806
How about taking a little break?

42:37.891 --> 42:40.060
Grief doesn't settle. Neither should we.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.442
Now, look...

42:49.152 --> 42:51.363
You know you don't have to
do that with me.

43:04.126 --> 43:06.044
Hey, it's Joshua, leave a message.

43:06.128 --> 43:08.755
And if it's you, honey, send me a text.

43:08.839 --> 43:10.591
You know I don't listen to these things.

43:16.763 --> 43:18.182
Come with me.

43:28.817 --> 43:30.068
You're safe here.

43:33.071 --> 43:34.740
Take as long as you need.

43:41.246 --> 43:42.664
Will you pray with me?

45:15.174 --> 45:16.425
Hey.

45:23.849 --> 45:25.392
I...

45:26.852 --> 45:28.812
Gonna do the podcast about Josh.

45:29.730 --> 45:33.317
But we have to be honest with each other.
You have to be honest with me.

45:34.902 --> 45:38.155
-Okay.
-The risk is too high if we're not.

45:40.991 --> 45:42.159
But you were right.

45:43.785 --> 45:45.787
Josh would've risked it all for me.

45:48.916 --> 45:50.584
You save me once again.

45:52.711 --> 45:55.255
No. We save each other.

45:56.798 --> 45:58.842
We have to do it publicly.

45:58.926 --> 46:00.260
On the podcast.

46:00.344 --> 46:02.679
Force the police
to look deeper into the case.

46:06.099 --> 46:07.100
Okay?

46:08.393 --> 46:09.520
Okay.

46:12.856 --> 46:14.066
Thank you.

46:14.650 --> 46:15.817
Get some rest.

46:32.835 --> 46:35.754
"Other people's tears are only water."

46:37.506 --> 46:42.094
My friend, Joshua Keith,
said that to me the night he died.

46:42.970 --> 46:46.014
I didn't know what he meant.
Why he said it.

46:47.766 --> 46:52.563
But now it feels as if he's...
speaking to me from the grave.

46:54.857 --> 46:57.526
Today, when I heard
that the case was closed,

46:57.609 --> 47:01.613
that his widow would never have
the answer she deserved,

47:03.282 --> 47:05.075
his words became prophetic.

47:06.910 --> 47:11.415
To the people who didn't know him,
Josh's death is a story.

47:12.082 --> 47:13.792
A headline.

47:14.918 --> 47:16.295
A case file number.

47:17.796 --> 47:20.007
But for those of us who loved him,

47:20.883 --> 47:22.801
it's a heartbreaking loss.

47:24.136 --> 47:27.264
A loss that deserves answers.

47:30.684 --> 47:33.312
Joshua wasn't religious.

47:33.395 --> 47:36.815
Not in the churchgoing
sense of the word, but he was...

47:37.858 --> 47:39.193
He was spiritual.

47:40.194 --> 47:45.157
A man of the world
that made curiosity his lodestar.

47:48.327 --> 47:50.829
As young cubs at The New York Times,

47:51.371 --> 47:56.251
he was endlessly amused
by my devotion to Sunday mass.

47:57.544 --> 47:59.171
It tickled him, and...

47:59.922 --> 48:02.299
until I explained it the way I felt it.

48:03.842 --> 48:07.930
And it came from a blessing
I heard at my first communion.

48:09.890 --> 48:12.684
"Teach your children scriptures early

48:12.768 --> 48:16.855
and they'll be able to access armor
they didn't even know they had."

48:18.857 --> 48:20.150
That was one of mine.

48:22.277 --> 48:23.570
The other, we shared.

48:25.239 --> 48:29.243
It was the tether
of our 20-year friendship.

48:32.371 --> 48:36.667
What tethered us together
was the pursuit of truth.

48:38.710 --> 48:41.713
I will continue that pursuit on his path,

48:41.797 --> 48:45.843
and I will not give up
until I have all the answers.

48:48.720 --> 48:52.558
The truth will be the light
that shines us through.

48:56.770 --> 48:59.523
So... here we go.

49:04.820 --> 49:08.657
Once again, my name is Poppy Parnell.

49:11.410 --> 49:15.539
And I'd like you to reconsider.
