00:01.794 --> 00:04.295
So, Ed, l know recently you've been
having some anger

00:04.380 --> 00:07.965
over not being able to find a
post-retirement job. How's that going?

00:08.050 --> 00:13.137
l worked 45 years supervising
200 people in waste management.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.724
And l can't even get a job
as a Walmart greeter.

00:16.809 --> 00:21.813
And they hire handicaps
and whatever else tumbles off the short bus.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.608
l'd like to say something
as a person with a job.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.193
You're lucky not to have one.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.321
l'd trade places with you in a second if
you weren't a creepy old man.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.533
lt sounds like you're having
some issues with your newjob, Lacey.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.659
You want to talk about it?

00:34.743 --> 00:38.496
lt's bad enough that my mother makes me
work to get my trust fund check,

00:38.580 --> 00:41.165
but the job starts in the morning.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.460
Have you ever woken up in the morning?

00:44.545 --> 00:47.922
lt's horrible. The sun's in the wrong place.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.844
You may not believe this, but most people

00:52.928 --> 00:55.805
wake up in the morning
and go to bed at night.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.892
lt started in the '40s, when they were
rationing daylight during World War ll.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.146
The worst part is sitting in traffic for hours.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.566
lt's like waiting in line at a club,
except when you get to the end,

01:06.650 --> 01:10.862
there's no dancing. There's just me,
selling blush at Sephora.

01:10.946 --> 01:14.198
Ain't nothing gonna fix that face, bitch.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.284
After they buy makeup from you,
they buy clothes from me.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.619
Nothing is gonna fix those hips, bitch.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.122
Then the bitch comes home to me.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.586
And l have to pay the credit card bill.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.547
And that's how America works.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.760
Well, great session, everybody.
See you all tomorrow.

01:33.844 --> 01:37.638
l just realized l'm not a part
of how America works.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.812
Hey, Lacey. Before you go,

01:44.897 --> 01:47.857
l'm worried about how
rush hour traffic might affect you.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.025
How have you been dealing with that?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.153
Pretty well. l just take it out on all
the other drivers around me.

01:53.155 --> 01:56.449
Yesterday l bumper-tapped a
minivan into an intersection.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.828
You're on probation. lf you get arrested
for road rage, they will put you in prison.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.790
l know. l should probably
see somebody about that.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.667
Lacey, where are you right now?

02:07.336 --> 02:09.086
l'm...

02:10.464 --> 02:12.298
Okay.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.220
How about l go out driving with you
in the morning traffic?

02:17.304 --> 02:20.181
l can show you some techniques,
how to diffuse your anger on the road.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.558
Okay. Pick me up at 9:00.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.143
No, no, no. You're going to drive.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.937
ln that traffic?

02:28.690 --> 02:31.192
Hey, we've got to figure out
a schedule for your dad's visit.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.444
Dad's visit? Who's he visiting?

02:33.529 --> 02:35.738
Us, you, tomorrow.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.824
-What?
-He didn't call you?

02:37.908 --> 02:40.326
He's been calling all week,
but l didn't answer.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.745
Not talking to him is so much easier
if l don't pick up the phone.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.750
Well, he's coming in tomorrow
and he's staying with you.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.671
Of course he's coming now. You know why?
He knows l'm happy.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.131
He can smell it all the way from Ohio.

02:54.466 --> 02:58.135
Maybe he just wants to see you.
You know, he's getting older.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.679
He's not gonna be around forever.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.681
Stop trying to cheer me up.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.022
Wow. Candles. Romantic.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.149
lt's not what we do.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.360
This is purely sexual.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.989
l just read a study about
which smells increase male arousal.

03:18.448 --> 03:22.159
This one's vanilla, that one's cinnamon,
that one's donut.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.746
lt smells like a stripper
standing in a Krispy Kreme.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.624
l like it.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.260
l don't want to see my father.
ls that so horrible?

03:40.178 --> 03:43.389
Well, if you're imagining him right now, it is.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.393
He drives me nuts.
l don't want him in my house.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.271
Let's take a moment and get past this.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.524
Okay. lf l were your father,
what would you say to me right now?

03:54.151 --> 03:57.111
Dad, that's not the bra you usually wear.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.780
Come on, serious. What would you say?

04:00.115 --> 04:02.700
l wouldn't say anything
because he doesn't listen.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.745
He just criticizes.
He shows no affection whatsoever.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.872
The guy's never hugged me.
l can't do right by him.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.832
l can't talk to him. l can't...

04:10.292 --> 04:12.668
l can't breathe.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.590
Okay. You're hyperventilating.
Put your head between your knees.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.093
-lt's not working.
-Okay.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.220
Put your head between my knees.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.474
That only relaxes you.

04:29.728 --> 04:33.481
Hey, Charlie. l got us tickets to take
your dad to the Dodger game on Friday.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.565
Does that sound good?

04:34.650 --> 04:37.610
Great. We can get him one of those giant
foam hands to poke me with

04:37.694 --> 04:40.571
when he reminds me
how l screwed up my baseball career.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.324
"The catcher could have been you." Poke.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.912
Will you stop anticipating problems?

04:47.996 --> 04:51.290
l don't anticipate problems with my dad.
l anticipate disasters.

04:51.667 --> 04:55.336
You watch. He'll walk through
that door, won't even acknowledge me.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.506
And then no matter what l do,
he'll find a way to complain about it.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.675
That's a problem, not a disaster.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.512
No, it will be when he destroys
everything with his heat vision.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.722
ls Grandpa here yet?

05:06.807 --> 05:07.932
Not yet, honey.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.185
You know, l don't think l've ever hung out
with you and Grandpa at the same time.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.895
Maybe they're the same person.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.064
Don't even joke about that.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.113
Charlie!

05:22.197 --> 05:23.781
Oh, all right.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.872
Charlie.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.374
Hey, Dad.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.209
Come here.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.589
Here you go, Dad.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.133
lmported, huh?

05:42.217 --> 05:45.678
l know you like Bud, but l've been so
busy working the past few days,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.096
l didn't have time to go to the store.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.223
You know l don't like imported beer,

05:50.517 --> 05:52.893
but this is delicious. Thank you, Charlie.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.649
-And now, to you.
-Yes.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.569
You know, every time l see you,
you get more and more beautiful.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.406
Martin, l used to think
you were a shameless flirt,

06:05.490 --> 06:07.658
but now l know you're just telling the truth.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.537
l always thought Charlie was an idiot
for letting you get away.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.913
Here we go.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.000
But you two seem happier now
than when you were married.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.294
You're a good man, Charlie Goodson.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.755
You took a bad situation
and you made it work.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.757
And?

06:23.675 --> 06:25.593
And l'm proud of you.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.389
Sam, why don't you show me
where l'm bunking?

06:30.474 --> 06:31.849
All right.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.894
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.481
lt's so good to see you. Both of you.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.280
Good night, guys.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.365
Good night.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.702
l know how this story ends.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.955
l call his wife in Ohio and she says,
"How can you be with your father?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.874
"He died five years ago."

07:00.462 --> 07:03.130
l'm not buying it.
Nobody changes that much.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.715
Maybe he's mellowed out.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.676
You're a therapist. You're supposed to
believe that human beings can change.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.595
l do believe that human beings can change.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.806
None of that applies to my father.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.141
l think you're overreacting.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.726
l'll prove it to you.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.729
He's not just critical of me. He'll come down
on anybody who disagrees with him.

07:18.814 --> 07:22.108
Religion, politics, he'll always find a way
to make it feel like you're wrong.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.609
Charlie, l don't want to be a part of this.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.402
Something smells good.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.906
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Dad. Sit down.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.575
l made breakfast. Coffee's brewing.
This is my neighbor, Michael.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.911
-Michael, good to meet you.
-You, too.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.080
We were just talking about how active
you were in the unions.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.667
Yes, indeed. Unions are the foundation
of the middle class.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.836
Michael doesn't believe in unions.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.088
He says they cut into corporate profits.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.090
l did?

07:46.675 --> 07:49.301
Well, you know, everyone is entitled to
their own opinion.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.387
Tell you the truth, since l retired,

07:51.471 --> 07:54.223
l've been keeping my eye
on the stock market as well.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.185
Really? Michael also said the Democrats
are screwing up the country.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.646
l have got to get to work.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.482
l don't think they screwed up.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.443
Of course, if l was president,
there are probably a few things

08:06.528 --> 08:07.862
l would do differently.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.907
You? As president? l just can't picture it.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.868
Thank you, Charlie.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.286
Michael also said...

08:15.370 --> 08:16.954
Your son has a girl that
he just calls for sex.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.207
They're not in love, they're never
getting married. lt's just sex, sex, sex.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.420
ls that true, Charlie?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.963
As a matter of fact, it is.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.174
Well, then, it's a good thing
you're not getting married

08:28.258 --> 08:32.219
because a loveless marriage is a tragedy
in the eyes of God.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.682
Speaking of God, l don't believe in him.

08:36.892 --> 08:37.933
Oh, boy.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.268
Or her.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.644
Oh, God.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.315
l struggle with that myself sometimes.

08:44.649 --> 08:49.612
But every time l look in your eyes,
l know that he or she exists.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.741
Good meeting you, Michael.
l hope you'll forgive me,

08:53.825 --> 08:56.243
but l don't want to miss Judge Judy.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.875
Well, Charlie. You proved it.
You're an ungrateful little snot.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.419
Now, give me my breakfast.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.505
This black Republican union buster
needs his energy.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.138
This is why l hate traffic.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.182
Just relax.
lt will start moving here in a minute.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.559
There's a carpool lane.
Why can't they have a separate lane

09:20.644 --> 09:22.436
for attractive people with fast little cars?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.439
Okay, this is obviously
an anger trigger for you.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.149
Remember your techniques. Use imagery.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.527
Think of this Fiat as your
bubble of calm. Nowjust breathe.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.779
Okay.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.281
Open your eyes when you breathe.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.493
You're freaking me out.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.412
l'm sorry, l'm sorry. Why don't we just talk?

09:41.456 --> 09:45.084
So, l didn't know l was going to
meet your dad this morning.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.835
He seems like such a nice guy.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.545
Yeah, thanks.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.466
He's like the nicest old man l've ever met.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.177
He's like Santa without a beard.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.470
All right.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.018
Guy came out of nowhere with no warning.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.482
Dude! Relax! What are you doing?
You're totally bursting my Fiat bubble.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.819
l mean, come on.
Look at his bumper stickers.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.446
"Coexist." "Visualize world peace."

10:14.531 --> 10:18.367
You want everyone to think you're nice,
but l know the truth, jerk face!

10:19.828 --> 10:22.329
Dude, what are you doing?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.248
l'm sorry.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.168
l let my dad get the best of me.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.006
Yeah. Perfect.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.092
lt's okay. Let me handle this. Girls,

10:36.594 --> 10:37.845
you're on.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.515
lt's a chick.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.643
Please be a lesbian.
Please be a lesbian. Please be a lesbian.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.859
That's a heck of an idea, Martin.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.611
What's a heck of an idea?

10:54.696 --> 10:56.947
Oh, your daddy and l were
just chewing the fat,

10:57.032 --> 10:59.908
talking about how hard
it is to get a job at our age.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.286
And l was talking about my road rage issues

11:02.370 --> 11:06.498
and how l should probably hire
a driver before l accidentally kill somebody.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.876
Because l really want to kill somebody.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.795
Well, l just thought maybe she
could toss Ed a few bucks

11:11.880 --> 11:13.130
and he could drive her around.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.925
Yeah, Dad, it's a nice idea, but
Lacey and Ed have a very complex dynamic.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.636
And there's a lot of emotional ramifications
to an arrangement like that.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.138
How's 20 bucks an hour?

11:21.222 --> 11:22.639
l'll do it for 30.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.560
Fifty if you want to listen to
that Arab music while l'm driving.

11:27.771 --> 11:31.148
Whatever. lt's my mom's money,
and l'm lndian.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.733
White people work for us now.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.321
Well, l got to go. Really nice meeting you.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.114
l hope you all get well soon.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.701
Hey, Dad. Before you go,
l have a big favor to ask.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.411
Sure.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.538
You want me happy, right?

11:46.623 --> 11:48.874
That's all l've ever wanted for you, Charlie.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.417
Of course.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.253
Would you be willing to
see my therapist with me

11:53.338 --> 11:55.214
and maybe talk some things out?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.591
ls everything okay?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.677
No, Dad. Everything is not okay.

12:01.763 --> 12:06.183
Well, okay. But you know,
l've never been in therapy before.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.935
Why would you have to?

12:09.771 --> 12:12.856
So, Charlie, you said some things
about your dad.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.901
Can you give me
an example of what you mean

12:15.985 --> 12:19.530
by "distant, hypercritical fascist"?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.909
Okay. Little League game. Nine years old.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.370
l was so desperate to make you proud of me.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.872
Fourth inning, l drop the pop fly.

12:28.957 --> 12:33.502
You stood up and stared at me with
a look of disgust, turned your back and left.

12:33.795 --> 12:37.047
l would never do that to you.
Don't you remember what happened?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.550
Your cousin came to the ballpark to tell me

12:39.634 --> 12:43.720
Aunt Cecile got killed by a bus.
l had to leave. lt was an emergency.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.266
-Aunt Cecile got hit by a bus?
-Yes.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.976
Wasn't she the one who
was drunk all the time?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.060
Yes.

12:50.145 --> 12:53.105
At work, at home, and sadly, at the bus stop.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.483
You never told me that.

12:56.568 --> 13:00.529
This is very common. Two people often
remember the same incident differently.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.782
And Charlie, sometimes we
selectively remember.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.034
l suppose that's possible.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.746
But l know for a fact that he took the
guitar that l bought with my own money

13:09.831 --> 13:11.915
and smashed it in the driveway
because l was playing it too loud.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.876
He's right.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.544
l did smash the guitar.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.754
Thank you. Thank you.
l thought l was going crazy.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.716
But not because you were playing too loud.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.844
l smashed it because l'd warned you,
"lf you don't get your grades up,

13:23.928 --> 13:25.762
"l'm going to have to get rid of the guitar."

13:25.847 --> 13:28.056
Okay. Okay. All right.
You know what? There's more.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.058
How about the time you took
the puppy away?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.894
l had to. lt died.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.229
You missed my graduation.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.314
l had to work.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.773
You made me shave my long hair.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.817
Because you had lice,
which you got from the puppy.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.612
My whole childhood, you were a bully.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.697
A bully?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.365
Excuse me, Kate.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.784
Would you please give me
a moment alone with my son?

13:47.869 --> 13:49.870
No problem.
Actually, this is a good time for me.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.706
Big iced tea, running waterfall,
bad combination.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.042
Thank you.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.629
Son, it really hurts me to hear you say

13:58.713 --> 14:02.216
that you've been carrying around
all this pain for so long.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.968
l know l wasn't the perfect father,

14:05.053 --> 14:07.471
but l am not that guy you think l was.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.641
Maybe Kate's right.

14:10.725 --> 14:14.311
Maybe l rewrote some of my history
to avoid taking responsibility

14:14.395 --> 14:16.355
for some of the crap l did.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.566
There are lots of ways to set things right.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.944
l tried your therapy.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.779
How about you trying mine?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.993
-Do it for Brett.
-Come on.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.286
-Do it.
-All right.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.999
"l'm the kid that stole the candy.
l'm that Yankee Doodle Dandy."

14:37.418 --> 14:39.169
Jimmy Cagney.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.964
-More.
-Do some Brando.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.759
"Are you an assassin?"

14:45.843 --> 14:47.636
"l'm a soldier."

14:47.720 --> 14:49.680
"You're neither.

14:49.764 --> 14:54.226
"You're an errand boy sent by
grocery clerks to collect a bill."

15:00.233 --> 15:01.733
l love that movie.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.780
You know, Charlie, if your father's
marital status ever changes,

15:06.864 --> 15:08.365
l'd like to be your new mama.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.077
A bartender wife.
That sounds interesting. Do you cook?

15:12.453 --> 15:13.787
ln bed.

15:15.081 --> 15:19.334
Seriously. My trailer is that small.
The microwave is actually next to the bed.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.130
"Here's looking at you, kid."

15:25.925 --> 15:29.011
So, that girl you're sleeping with,

15:29.095 --> 15:32.306
the one you have no intention of marrying.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.224
lt's that therapist, am l right?

15:34.309 --> 15:35.392
How did you know?

15:35.476 --> 15:36.977
l didn't until just now.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.232
Anyway, if you're not going to
remarry Jennifer, which you should,

15:42.317 --> 15:45.819
you should seriously consider
making an honest woman out of Kate.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.114
She's more fun as a dishonest woman.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.034
Let me tell you something, son.
Your dear mother, may God rest her soul...

15:52.118 --> 15:54.369
She's not dead. Quit saying that.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.996
She's remarried and living in Tampa.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.958
l don't keep track.
Anyway, she reminds me a lot of Kate.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.170
A lot to handle, but well worth it.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.839
Well, here's to difficult women.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.841
And the men who cannot handle them.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.639
This is my 1 0th birthday.
That's my dad and my brother.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.599
That's me on the end.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.269
You're lucky. My family never made
any home movies with me.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.898
l was the fourth kid.
My father was fond of saying

16:22.982 --> 16:25.150
l was the fourth of three.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.027
Hey, l can always photoshop you into mine.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.198
Here, Charlie, we got you a 45-year-old
bald man for your birthday.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.491
His stories are kind of a bummer,

16:32.575 --> 16:33.992
but they'll make you feel better
about your own life.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.081
You don't have to do that.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.085
l just can't get over how young l...

16:43.795 --> 16:45.045
Hold on.

16:45.797 --> 16:46.880
What?

16:50.051 --> 16:51.968
That woman with her back to us.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.345
Yeah?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.348
That's my Aunt Cecile.
My dad said she died a year before this.

16:56.599 --> 17:00.102
Good for her. lt looks like she's almost
completely recovered from her death.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.854
Oh, my God, l was right. l'm not crazy.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.940
My dad really is a terrible person.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.983
Congratulations.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.235
Thank you.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.781
l'm really glad you're driving me, Ed.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.741
l'm going to show up
at work so much more relaxed.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.452
My pleasure, Miss Daisy.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.372
l don't know if l ever told you,
but a long time ago, l used to drive...

17:20.456 --> 17:22.958
Don't let that girl in! Don't let her in!
Why'd you let her in?

17:23.042 --> 17:27.254
Because she had her blinker on
and she smiled at me. l'm a sucker for that.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.006
Quick, that lane's open! Go, go, go, go!

17:30.091 --> 17:32.426
That is not a lane. That's a shoulder!

17:32.510 --> 17:33.885
That's for emergencies.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.262
Well, you're going to need
to go to the hospital

17:35.346 --> 17:36.555
if you don't pick up the pace!

17:36.639 --> 17:39.683
l knew this was not a good idea.
l'm warning you,

17:39.767 --> 17:41.852
one more word out of you,
just one more word...

17:41.936 --> 17:43.145
Yeah, whatcha gonna do?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.604
That's it!

17:51.279 --> 17:53.613
Screw you! My driver left.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.907
Ed?

17:59.537 --> 18:01.037
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey, Dad.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.540
-Can l get you a beer?
-Sure. What do you got?

18:03.624 --> 18:06.168
Well, let's see.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.880
l've got "dirty filthy liar,"

18:09.964 --> 18:11.965
"my dad's a bastard,"

18:13.634 --> 18:15.844
and a lager from Holland.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.055
Still haven't gotten any Bud Light, huh?

18:19.140 --> 18:22.142
There he is. Hi, Dad.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.733
Okay.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.651
What happened?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.530
You told me Aunt Cecile died
when l was nine.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.492
l've got home movies of her
at my 1 0th birthday.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.494
Sitting at the table when
l blew out the candles.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.998
Was she moving?

18:46.918 --> 18:49.753
Just enough to get her
beer mug to her face.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.505
So, l lied about one little thing.

18:51.589 --> 18:56.968
No, you didn't. l found my report card
from the year you smashed my guitar.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.679
My grades, they never dropped.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.809
And l talked to Mom.
You traded the puppy for a power drill.

19:04.018 --> 19:07.979
Well, at least the dog didn't die.
l mean, l'm sure he's dead now, but...

19:09.524 --> 19:12.359
Why did you come here?
Why are you being so nice?

19:12.443 --> 19:13.944
What do you want?

19:14.028 --> 19:18.448
l want to leave Ohio.
There's nothing left there for me.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.451
All my friends are gone,

19:21.536 --> 19:24.454
and your siblings
won't have anything to do with me.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.039
What about your wife?

19:26.791 --> 19:29.000
Corinne left me last month.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.964
And if it will make you feel any better,
she took my puppy.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.591
So now you're a puppy guy?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.177
Charlie, look.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.723
l want to move out here
and l want to live with you.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.018
You act like a jerk my whole life,
then lie about it,

19:47.103 --> 19:48.603
now you want me to take you in?

19:48.688 --> 19:54.067
l really need some help, see, because l don't
have enough money left to live on my own.

19:55.653 --> 19:59.155
And if l could do anything
about the past, l would.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.574
Hell, you know l tried.

20:01.534 --> 20:06.580
And it would have worked, too, if it hadn't
been for the boozy ghost ofAunt Cecile.

20:08.249 --> 20:12.085
Look, l'll do the best l can from here on.
That's all l can promise.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.796
-One last thing.
-Anything.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.673
-And l need the truth.
-You bet.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.259
Did Mom really leave you

20:19.343 --> 20:21.845
or did you trade her to that guy
in Tampa for a belt sander?

20:23.931 --> 20:26.433
No, actually, it was a leaf blower.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.858
Don't get too hard on yourself.
Your dad fooled us both.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.446
l think it's really sweet that
you're getting him his own place out here.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.197
Yeah, it's in a really nice area.

20:41.282 --> 20:44.451
He just has to decide if
he wants to be a Blood or a Crip.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.455
-Charlie.
-l'm kidding, kidding.

20:48.539 --> 20:49.998
lt's about 20 minutes away.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.918
Just far enough so he can't just walk
over here whenever he wants.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.963
At least now l know what you'll look
like in your 70s.

20:57.632 --> 21:01.134
Based on your dad's looks,
l could still be doing you.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.469
Thanks.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.263
Hey, you got a picture of your mom
so l can see what l might be getting into?

21:05.556 --> 21:07.474
Actually, l look more like my dad.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.393
But if it makes you feel any better,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.145
he's got an ass that won't quit.
