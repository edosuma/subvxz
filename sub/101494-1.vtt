Hey, I'm Dane Marbeck or
you can call me Marbles.

01:28.665 --> 01:30.433
I beg your pardon?

01:30.467 --> 01:32.702
So, who died?

01:32.735 --> 01:34.871
My niece, Nikita.

01:34.904 --> 01:36.406
My husband, Jack.

01:36.439 --> 01:37.774
My Reg.

01:37.807 --> 01:39.241
Someone who cut my hair.

01:39.274 --> 01:42.010
Well, someone who
used to cut my hair

01:42.044 --> 01:43.613
and then, you know.

01:45.214 --> 01:46.716
Do you want to
apologize to them,

01:46.749 --> 01:48.250
or do you want to
confess something,

01:48.283 --> 01:51.220
or maybe you just want to give
them permission to pass over?

01:51.253 --> 01:52.789
What do you mean?

01:52.822 --> 01:54.256
To the next plane.

01:54.289 --> 01:56.258
What's the next plane?

01:57.259 --> 01:58.628
I don't know.

01:58.661 --> 01:59.796
But she might have stayed?

01:59.829 --> 02:01.431
Of course, it
depends on the deceased

02:01.464 --> 02:04.767
'cause they have to actively
choose to pass over.

02:04.801 --> 02:06.001
I don't get it.

02:06.034 --> 02:07.871
It's kind of like
there's this great party

02:07.904 --> 02:09.137
and you've been forced to leave,

02:09.170 --> 02:10.406
but you don't want
to leave the party.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.075
She'd never
like to leave a party.

02:13.108 --> 02:14.343
Well, there you go.

02:14.377 --> 02:16.011
Here she goes.

02:16.044 --> 02:17.480
What's that?

02:17.514 --> 02:19.816
It's what makes talking
with ghosts possible.

02:19.849 --> 02:20.683
Ready?

02:40.168 --> 02:42.170
Can you see me?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.573
He's still naked.

02:43.606 --> 02:44.941
You can see him?

02:44.974 --> 02:45.775
He's here?

02:47.010 --> 02:48.611
Hello.

02:48.645 --> 02:50.078
My name is Marbles.

02:50.112 --> 02:52.214
- So his name's Jack?
- Jack, yep.

02:52.247 --> 02:53.148
Jack, okay,

02:53.181 --> 02:54.182
and it happened over there?

02:54.216 --> 02:56.118
Yep, just there.

02:56.151 --> 02:57.319
Okay.

03:00.355 --> 03:02.324
Something's wrong.

03:06.696 --> 03:08.063
Can I speak to her?

03:08.096 --> 03:09.331
Yeah, of course,

03:09.364 --> 03:12.669
but you'll have to talk through me.
I'll be like a condweet.

03:12.702 --> 03:14.037
A what?

03:14.069 --> 03:14.938
A condweet?

03:14.971 --> 03:16.338
Yeah, a condweet.

03:16.371 --> 03:17.774
You talk to me and I'll,

03:17.807 --> 03:19.742
you tell me and I'll tell her.

03:19.776 --> 03:21.143
Oh, you mean a conduit.

03:21.176 --> 03:22.812
Of
course, a conduit.

03:22.845 --> 03:24.447
You mean a conduit.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.715
Yeah.

03:29.217 --> 03:30.486
What's wrong?

03:30.520 --> 03:32.021
How long ago did
your girlfriend die?

03:32.055 --> 03:33.990
Girlfriend?
I wouldn't say she's my girlfriend.

03:34.023 --> 03:34.924
She's just someone...

03:34.958 --> 03:36.459
Yeah, but how long
ago did it happen?

03:36.492 --> 03:37.660
It's not good you
sticking around.

03:37.694 --> 03:39.596
It's not good you
sticking around here.

03:39.629 --> 03:42.364
A couple, eight months.

03:42.398 --> 03:45.068
Oh my god, you should have
called me as soon as it happened.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.637
We need to get her
to want to pass over.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.405
I don't want her to pass over.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.907
So this is like
a bathroom, is it?

03:50.940 --> 03:53.275
- Yeah, but...
- But there's another bathroom in the house?

03:53.308 --> 03:54.209
Yeah.

03:54.242 --> 03:56.278
Use that I reckon, use that.

03:56.311 --> 03:58.313
Okay, anyway, mate,

03:58.347 --> 04:00.315
listen, no charge.

04:00.349 --> 04:02.184
Your house is fine.

04:02.217 --> 04:03.419
Okay, you know bananas

04:03.453 --> 04:05.388
when they get like
really old and spotty

04:05.421 --> 04:07.023
and they go all black
and then they shrivel up,

04:07.056 --> 04:10.627
and they make all the other
fruit in the bowl go black?

04:10.660 --> 04:11.461
Yeah.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.065
Jack?

04:16.099 --> 04:17.033
Jackie boy?

04:18.668 --> 04:20.403
I mean, it's a good
thing he's not here

04:20.435 --> 04:23.806
'cause that'll mean he's
probably passed over,

04:23.840 --> 04:25.041
which means he's had a good life

04:25.074 --> 04:26.308
and he's had no
regrets, you know?

04:26.341 --> 04:27.777
So that's a good thing.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.479
If you ever feel an
oppressive presence

04:29.512 --> 04:31.279
that makes you feel real bad,

04:31.313 --> 04:34.316
like there's a deep
darkness in your soul,

04:34.349 --> 04:35.618
give me a call.

04:36.686 --> 04:37.787
Okay.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.155
What, more than normal?

04:40.188 --> 04:42.290
Oh, no charge honestly.

04:45.662 --> 04:47.096
I just,

04:47.130 --> 04:49.231
I just wanted one more chance
to say something to him,

04:49.264 --> 04:50.066
you know?

04:50.099 --> 04:53.102
Yeah, I know.

04:55.938 --> 04:58.708
So he's very close
to you right now.

04:58.741 --> 05:00.910
He's just a few inches
away from your face.

05:00.943 --> 05:04.414
My dear.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.418
Marbeck.

05:09.619 --> 05:10.853
You can see me.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.556
I've paid all my bills.

05:13.589 --> 05:14.791
I've arranged
everything for her.

05:14.824 --> 05:16.025
Excuse me, sir.

05:16.059 --> 05:18.193
I just need to talk to this gentleman.
Marbeck...

05:18.226 --> 05:19.729
It's probably
not for you, mate.

05:19.762 --> 05:23.399
Phillis, I'm just gonna step
outside for a few seconds

05:23.433 --> 05:25.200
just to give you guys
a bit of alone time.

05:25.233 --> 05:30.139
So, he can hear everything
that you're gonna say, okay?

05:30.173 --> 05:31.174
Thank you.

05:34.110 --> 05:36.244
This is a miracle.

05:36.278 --> 05:37.680
Yeah.

05:37.714 --> 05:38.748
Okay, listen, we need to talk.

05:38.781 --> 05:40.183
My name is Officer Jayson Tagg...

05:40.215 --> 05:41.617
Of the Aotearoa
Police Service.

05:41.651 --> 05:42.452
I know.

05:42.485 --> 05:43.653
You've arrested me once.

05:43.686 --> 05:45.320
- I know you've got something!
- You're tickling me!

05:45.353 --> 05:46.389
You're tickling me!

05:46.422 --> 05:47.523
Hey, then what's this?

05:47.557 --> 05:48.458
What is this?

05:48.491 --> 05:49.926
I use that to see ghosts!

05:49.959 --> 05:51.427
I think I've searched
you a couple of times,

05:51.461 --> 05:53.763
but no, I've never charged you.

05:53.796 --> 05:56.065
What happened, man?

05:56.099 --> 05:56.899
Murdered.

05:56.933 --> 05:57.700
What?

05:57.734 --> 05:58.935
On a case.

05:58.968 --> 05:59.969
Whoa, man.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.505
That's a bum hole.

06:02.538 --> 06:05.340
Yeah, it's a bum hole.

06:05.373 --> 06:07.577
How are you feeling about it?
Are you okay?

06:07.610 --> 06:10.747
Is there anybody else
that I can talk to?

06:10.780 --> 06:12.849
Well no, I think it's just me.

06:12.882 --> 06:14.249
Okay.

06:14.282 --> 06:15.618
In that case then,
listen, I need your help.

06:15.651 --> 06:16.452
Yeah, of course, man.

06:16.486 --> 06:17.887
What do you need?

06:19.088 --> 06:21.791
I'm gonna hunt the man
responsible for my death

06:21.824 --> 06:23.126
and take him down.

06:25.728 --> 06:27.797
Yeah,

06:27.830 --> 06:29.165
I'm not gonna do that.

06:29.198 --> 06:30.700
He's killed six
people already.

06:30.733 --> 06:31.834
I am number seven.

06:31.868 --> 06:33.402
- Yeah, all right.
- Listen.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.937
I've got some life insurance.

06:34.971 --> 06:38.808
Hey, we can find a way to
cut you in on some of it.

06:38.841 --> 06:40.810
But what about
your family, man?

06:40.843 --> 06:42.945
Listen, the killer
dropped some evidence.

06:42.979 --> 06:44.247
Do you have any family?

06:44.279 --> 06:45.347
Yeah, I've got
a foster sister.

06:45.381 --> 06:46.348
She doesn't need the money.

06:46.382 --> 06:47.850
Okay.

06:47.884 --> 06:50.153
That's who you need to focus
on right now, mate, okay?

06:50.186 --> 06:52.989
And I can be that conduit
between you and her.

06:53.022 --> 06:54.957
I can be there for you.

06:58.326 --> 06:59.228
Dane Marbeck.

06:59.262 --> 07:00.062
That's your name, isn't it?

07:00.096 --> 07:00.997
Can I call you Dane?

07:01.030 --> 07:01.898
Call me Marbles, man.

07:01.931 --> 07:02.899
Everyone does.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.100
It's my nickname.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.636
Listen, if you help
me find this guy,

07:06.669 --> 07:10.273
you could be a hero,
a national hero.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.742
What do you think about that?

07:14.210 --> 07:18.281
Yeah, I just help the
dead find peace, okay?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.650
I don't help hunt the living

07:20.683 --> 07:23.386
or with murder
cases or whatever,

07:23.419 --> 07:25.521
so good luck to you, man.

07:27.089 --> 07:29.725
Dane, he's already
killed six people!

07:29.759 --> 07:32.295
He's gonna keep on killing
people until you help me!

07:32.327 --> 07:33.162
Dane!

07:35.031 --> 07:38.801
Tell her that I was really
sorry that I took the bath.

07:38.835 --> 07:40.335
I just love baths.

07:40.368 --> 07:42.471
He knows it was really dumb
but it was a really good bath.

07:42.505 --> 07:45.340
And I do
love you so much.

07:46.676 --> 07:48.010
He does love you.

07:48.044 --> 07:49.779
And that she's crazy,

07:49.812 --> 07:51.581
and she's the smartest

07:51.614 --> 07:54.150
and the silliest
person I've ever met.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.418
And she knows...

07:57.286 --> 07:58.988
You're the most beautiful,

07:59.021 --> 08:01.924
spectacular person
he's ever known.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.630
I have to go, I think.

08:28.751 --> 08:30.086
I felt him go.

08:35.758 --> 08:36.592
Thank you.

08:41.163 --> 08:43.765
You spent an hour talking
with an old dead man

08:43.799 --> 08:45.501
and an old nearly dead woman.

08:45.534 --> 08:47.169
- What you should...
- Peanut brownie?

08:47.203 --> 08:48.871
No, I can't.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.106
What you could be doing

08:50.139 --> 08:52.241
is helping me effect
some real change...

08:54.810 --> 08:57.747
A hit usually
lasts about an hour.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.715
Sayonara, Officer Tagg.

09:23.039 --> 09:25.474
Dane, Dane, listen to me.

09:25.508 --> 09:27.176
It's a piece of paper.

09:27.209 --> 09:29.045
Look, all you have to
do is go to the scene,

09:29.078 --> 09:31.747
grab a piece of paper,
take it to my sister,

09:31.781 --> 09:33.582
and you could be a hero.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.918

11:44.013 --> 11:46.082
you'll turn into a shell.

11:48.984 --> 11:50.753
Who are you?

11:50.786 --> 11:52.254
Xavier, ma'am.

11:52.288 --> 11:55.124
And can I just say what an
honor it is to meet you?

11:55.157 --> 11:57.359
What's with the box, mum?

11:58.260 --> 11:59.895
I had an offer on the farm.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.398
What?

12:01.431 --> 12:03.999
I said I've
had an offer on the farm.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.569
Oh no, I heard you.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.204
Why did you say what then?

12:08.237 --> 12:09.439
Disbelief, maybe.

12:09.473 --> 12:10.574
What, you don't believe me?

12:10.606 --> 12:11.807
No, I believe you.

12:11.841 --> 12:15.111
Why the
disbelief then, Dane?

12:15.144 --> 12:16.612
Hm.

12:16.645 --> 12:18.080
I've given you
more than enough time

12:18.114 --> 12:19.315
to come up with the money,

12:19.348 --> 12:22.918
but this offer means
that I can leave now.

12:22.952 --> 12:25.154
I'm in a good place now.

12:25.187 --> 12:26.322
I can move on.

12:26.355 --> 12:29.859
I just brought you
some of your old stuff.

12:32.027 --> 12:34.697
I'm really happy for you, mum.

12:36.165 --> 12:38.267
How much did they offer if
you don't mind my asking?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.935
You can't afford
to counter it.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.138
Whatever. I just want to
know how much it is, mum.

12:42.171 --> 12:43.105
Don't say whatever, Dane.

12:43.139 --> 12:44.206
It's uncouth.

12:45.509 --> 12:46.675
Sorry.

12:46.709 --> 12:48.978
Don't apologize, just
don't say it again.

12:49.011 --> 12:50.346
Listen, I've been
doing some savings

12:50.380 --> 12:53.182
and I've got not
enough for a deposit.

12:53.215 --> 12:56.051
Why is this so
important to you?

12:58.187 --> 12:59.355
'Cause of...

13:00.689 --> 13:01.591
Speak up.

13:02.691 --> 13:04.494
Well, 'cause of dad.

13:06.228 --> 13:07.531
I didn't even make it in time

13:07.564 --> 13:10.467
to say goodbye
before he, you know.

13:12.636 --> 13:13.869
I'm gonna go.

13:17.373 --> 13:19.808
See you at my party, Marbles.

13:23.179 --> 13:24.013
Dane,

13:25.948 --> 13:28.951
150,000 is a lot
of money, isn't it?

13:34.290 --> 13:36.158
Tell you what.

13:36.192 --> 13:38.794
I'll give you two days to
come up with the money.

13:38.827 --> 13:41.464
After that, it's
out of my hands.

13:41.498 --> 13:42.731
I have to sell.

14:30.112 --> 14:32.114
- Game!
- For god's sake,

14:33.483 --> 14:34.917
go and get ready.

14:36.986 --> 14:38.421
Ross!

14:38.455 --> 14:40.690
We have to be out of here
in 10 minutes. Just go!

14:40.724 --> 14:42.392
Okay,.

14:42.425 --> 14:43.359
Honestly.

14:44.893 --> 14:46.962
Like a bloody teenager!

14:48.364 --> 14:51.033
She loves it, Marbles.

14:59.576 --> 15:00.410
Dane!

15:01.844 --> 15:02.679
Dane!

15:05.548 --> 15:06.949
Oh my god, dad.

15:11.186 --> 15:14.256
I shouldn't have taken
you down to the pond, dad.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.592
Oh, rubbish, rubbish.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.160
No, I really, really enjoyed it.

15:18.193 --> 15:19.763
- Honestly.
- Okay.

15:19.795 --> 15:23.265
Remember I used to take you
down there when you were a kid?

15:23.299 --> 15:24.800
Remember I told you
there were fish in it?

15:29.739 --> 15:31.807
Listen, son, there are
two feelings in this world

15:31.840 --> 15:33.275
that are completely useless

15:33.309 --> 15:35.978
and one of them is regret, okay?

15:39.482 --> 15:44.253
Yeah, 'cause life's...
life's, yeah.

15:47.590 --> 15:49.158
And what's the other feeling?

15:49.191 --> 15:52.462
Dane, get
down here now, Dane.

15:52.495 --> 15:55.598
Sounds ominous.

15:55.632 --> 15:58.635
She doesn't like
when I come over.

15:59.569 --> 16:01.070
She says it makes you tired

16:01.103 --> 16:05.475
and that she says that I'm
not allowed to visit anymore.

16:05.508 --> 16:08.445
Dane, you're
always welcome here.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.849
This is our place.

16:13.882 --> 16:17.219
Dane Marbeck, I am
not asking you a third time!

16:17.252 --> 16:18.087
Go on.

16:28.063 --> 16:32.502
Officer Jayson Tagg of
the Aotearoa Police Service,

16:33.969 --> 16:37.973
how much life insurance
are we talking about?

16:38.006 --> 16:40.008
Atta-boy, Marbeck.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.014
It was a beautiful sunny morning

16:46.048 --> 16:48.083
and I was walking the
beat along Patrick Beach

16:48.117 --> 16:50.653
like I do every week.

16:50.687 --> 16:52.589
The first victim had
been abducted from there

16:52.622 --> 16:54.858
about two years ago

16:54.890 --> 16:57.794
and the perpetrator had
eluded me ever since.

16:57.827 --> 17:00.597
I guess you could say my
instincts were on high alert

17:00.630 --> 17:04.098
and I could just tell that
this guy was bad news.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.968
How did you know?

17:06.001 --> 17:07.368
Instinct.

17:07.404 --> 17:09.204
What, 'cause he
was wearing a hood?

17:09.238 --> 17:11.473
Okay, you wouldn't understand.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.810
Judging people 'cause
of the way they look, hey?

17:13.843 --> 17:14.743
Okay.

17:14.778 --> 17:15.779
You're one of them, Marbeck.

17:15.811 --> 17:17.311
Please call me Marbles, man.

17:17.346 --> 17:19.047
I'm not gonna
call you Marbles.

17:19.080 --> 17:19.883
Hang on.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.417
One of them?

17:21.451 --> 17:23.018
You're a coaster.

17:24.387 --> 17:26.689
What, one of those
things you put a drink on?

17:26.723 --> 17:30.058
No, you're a drainer, a taker.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.927
Okay, there are two types of
people in the world, right?

17:31.960 --> 17:33.830
Some people do good
things for good people.

17:33.863 --> 17:36.131
They do work, they
stimulate the economy.

17:36.165 --> 17:38.568
You know, and then there's...

17:41.036 --> 17:42.639
You know.

17:42.672 --> 17:43.606
Disappointments.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.940
Exactly.

17:44.973 --> 17:48.812
Anyway, a second later,
he proved his guilt.

17:48.845 --> 17:50.212
How?

17:50.245 --> 17:51.648
He ran.

17:57.152 --> 17:57.520
Hey!

18:02.425 --> 18:07.329
This is Officer Jayson Tagg of
the Aotearoa Police Service!

18:08.531 --> 18:09.732
Hey!

18:38.026 --> 18:38.862
Hey!

18:46.134 --> 18:47.871
And then I noticed something.

18:47.904 --> 18:50.339
The one bit of evidence I
have of this serial killer

18:50.372 --> 18:53.041
is a coin from a necklace.

18:53.075 --> 18:54.911
This is our guy.

18:54.944 --> 18:57.514
So I ask myself am I
ready to risk my life

18:57.547 --> 18:59.749
to catch this son of a bitch?!

18:59.782 --> 19:02.084
And what did you
answer yourself?

19:02.117 --> 19:03.620
Take a guess.

19:03.653 --> 19:05.153
You were ready?

19:05.187 --> 19:06.188
I'm ready.

19:08.056 --> 19:10.660
Then he disappeared
into the darkness,

19:10.693 --> 19:15.030
but not before I saw something
fall from his pocket.

19:21.604 --> 19:23.171
And then what happened?

19:23.205 --> 19:26.976
Well, I let my guard
down like a bloody fool.

19:27.010 --> 19:28.978
And then what happened?

19:29.012 --> 19:31.915
Well, I got knocked out.

19:31.948 --> 19:33.315
Well yeah, and
then what happened?

19:34.283 --> 19:37.085
I woke up in a barn.

19:37.119 --> 19:38.320
As a ghost?

19:38.353 --> 19:40.523
I suppose so, yeah.

19:40.557 --> 19:42.392
Okay, how
were you killed?

19:42.425 --> 19:45.060
Well,
I don't remember.

19:45.093 --> 19:46.829
But was
your body there?

19:46.863 --> 19:48.363
No.

19:48.398 --> 19:50.198
Well, people's ghosts
appear where they were killed

19:50.232 --> 19:52.969
so I guess you
were killed there.

19:58.708 --> 19:59.542
Yana?

20:02.011 --> 20:03.245
Yana?

20:03.278 --> 20:05.949
My sister couldn't
hear me knock or yell.

20:05.982 --> 20:07.650
Maybe she wasn't home.

20:07.684 --> 20:10.520
No, she's always
home right now.

20:27.870 --> 20:28.705
Sharon!

20:30.974 --> 20:35.310
Sharon, can you...

20:41.584 --> 20:43.519
Then I realized I was...

20:46.656 --> 20:47.457
- Dead.
- Dead.

20:47.490 --> 20:49.626
Wow.

20:49.659 --> 20:50.860
But we've got him.

20:50.893 --> 20:52.528
Marbeck, the hoodie
left us a clue.

20:52.562 --> 20:53.362
What?

20:54.864 --> 20:56.666
That piece of paper.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.568
Well, don't touch it.

20:58.601 --> 20:59.736
It's evidence.

21:00.937 --> 21:01.738
Use the...

21:16.218 --> 21:17.987
What are you?

21:18.021 --> 21:20.757
I meant the plastic
bag, Marbeck.

21:28.064 --> 21:30.198
I was the target.

21:30.232 --> 21:31.467
Handsome pic.

21:33.268 --> 21:37.339
Walks the beat, Patrick
Beach, Friday mornings.

21:38.608 --> 21:41.209
He knew where I was gonna be.

21:41.243 --> 21:42.912
What do we do now?

21:44.814 --> 21:46.683
We take the evidence and
we take it to my sister.

21:46.716 --> 21:48.084
- Okay.
- 'Kay.

21:48.117 --> 21:48.918
Yes, sir.

21:48.951 --> 21:50.185
What are you doing?

21:50.218 --> 21:52.455
- I'm saluting you.
- We don't do that.

21:52.488 --> 21:53.690
I was just saying that.

21:53.723 --> 21:55.124
I was just saluting
you though, Tagg.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.098
So convenient.

22:02.131 --> 22:03.365
And sometimes like during
wet weather or stuff,

22:03.399 --> 22:06.969
you can just put like
a towel in there.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.304
Umbrella not, unfortunately.

22:09.337 --> 22:11.074
That'd be cool, hey?

22:11.107 --> 22:11.908
Okay.

22:11.941 --> 22:13.341
Ooh, nice house.

22:13.376 --> 22:14.410
Oh, my key.

22:14.444 --> 22:15.945
I always forget my keys.

22:15.978 --> 22:19.015
Whoa, bro, must cost
a bit to live here.

22:19.048 --> 22:20.883
Yeah, my sister's a lawyer.

22:20.917 --> 22:21.918
Well, was.

22:21.951 --> 22:22.785
Was?

22:27.390 --> 22:28.658
Oh hi.

22:28.691 --> 22:30.927
My name is Marbles and
I'm a friend of Tagg's.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.128
- No, you're not.
- No you're not.

22:32.161 --> 22:33.162
Jayson doesn't have friends.

22:33.196 --> 22:33.996
Exactly.

22:34.030 --> 22:34.831
What?

22:34.864 --> 22:36.065
No, I've got friends.

22:36.099 --> 22:39.068
Okay, well I'm more
of a colleague then.

22:39.102 --> 22:40.203
You're a cop?

22:40.235 --> 22:41.170
No, he's not a cop.

22:41.204 --> 22:43.406
No, yeah, I am.

22:43.439 --> 22:44.741
I'm kind of an investigator.

22:44.774 --> 22:48.111
I'm helping Tagg with the case.

22:48.144 --> 22:52.381
What kind of investigator
drives a scooter?

22:52.415 --> 22:54.851
One who doesn't
want to be suspicious

22:54.884 --> 22:57.153
in front of the
common man, I guess.

22:57.186 --> 22:58.087
Huh.

22:58.121 --> 23:00.288
What does Jayson look like?

23:02.759 --> 23:03.926
Kinda short,

23:05.561 --> 23:07.630
quite piercing eyes.

23:07.663 --> 23:10.466
He's got a mustache
that's quite,

23:10.500 --> 23:11.366
it suits him.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.401
Mustache?

23:12.435 --> 23:13.669
And he's quite
built up the top

23:13.703 --> 23:14.971
and it comes down
to skinny legs.

23:15.004 --> 23:17.206
- Skinny legs?
- Yeah.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.674
Huh.

23:18.708 --> 23:20.109
But underneath like that
really tough exterior,

23:20.143 --> 23:23.345
he's actually quite a mushy
marshmallow, I reckon.

23:26.348 --> 23:28.518
How exciting, a visitor.

23:29.385 --> 23:30.219
Yeah.

23:32.488 --> 23:34.390
Hey, where is Jayson?

23:39.262 --> 23:40.830
Okay, about that.

23:48.104 --> 23:49.405
Are you okay, Yana?

23:49.438 --> 23:50.940
Yeah.

23:50.973 --> 23:53.442
I always suspected something
like this would happen.

23:53.476 --> 23:54.710
It's a dangerous job.

23:54.744 --> 23:56.311
Yeah, it can be.

23:56.344 --> 23:57.180
Can be.

23:58.346 --> 24:00.249
And it's not like
he's officially dead,

24:00.283 --> 24:01.851
just missing.

24:01.884 --> 24:05.688
I mean, there's still a
chance he'll show up, right?

24:05.721 --> 24:08.291
Anyway, give her the
piece of paper, Marbeck.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.559
You're done here.

24:09.592 --> 24:12.228
Hey, how did you get
the ankle bracelet?

24:12.261 --> 24:13.863
No, Marbeck, you're done.

24:13.896 --> 24:15.431
Drunk driving.

24:15.464 --> 24:16.566
Oh.

24:16.599 --> 24:18.000
Four charges.

24:18.034 --> 24:18.868
Oh.

24:20.503 --> 24:21.971
So what,

24:22.004 --> 24:24.540
you just hang around here
doing nothing all day, huh?

24:24.574 --> 24:26.142
Not exactly.

24:26.175 --> 24:29.045
I was helping Jase
with this case.

24:29.078 --> 24:32.114
Those are all
the other victims.

24:32.148 --> 24:34.317
Do you think they were all
killed by the same person?

24:34.349 --> 24:38.654
- Yeah, no doubt about it.
- No doubt in my mind.

24:38.688 --> 24:39.522
Yana,

24:40.857 --> 24:41.958
Tagg is here.

24:43.860 --> 24:44.894
His body?

24:44.927 --> 24:46.262
No, he's here.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.699
What, his ashes?

24:49.732 --> 24:50.967
No, he's here.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.801
In here?

24:51.834 --> 24:53.236
No.

24:53.269 --> 24:57.073
Okay, this is gonna sound
really weird, but...

24:57.106 --> 24:58.608
How do I say this?

24:58.641 --> 25:01.277
I can see ghosts, Yana.

25:02.545 --> 25:03.713
Oh wait, listen,
this will be easy.

25:03.746 --> 25:05.281
Just ask me any
questions about Tagg

25:05.314 --> 25:07.116
and I'll be able to
give you the answer.

25:07.149 --> 25:08.050
No wait, I've got one.

25:08.084 --> 25:10.086
No wait, he's got one.

25:11.187 --> 25:12.021
Okay.

25:13.689 --> 25:16.225
The secret to her
smile's fresh breath

25:16.259 --> 25:19.428
is lengthy nightly
vibrating brushing.

25:20.596 --> 25:23.432
Lengthy nightly
vibrating brushing?

25:23.466 --> 25:24.600
Oh my god.

25:24.634 --> 25:26.068
Yeah, which would
have been fine

25:26.102 --> 25:27.937
but she just shouldn't have
used it on her mouth afterwards.

25:27.970 --> 25:29.705
Shouldn't have used it
on her mouth afterwards,

25:29.739 --> 25:30.539
is that?

25:30.573 --> 25:31.807
Oh my god, stop!

25:31.841 --> 25:33.242
Right, 'cause
when she was 16...

25:33.276 --> 25:34.510
When she was 16...

25:34.543 --> 25:35.778
- Yeah, she got a cold sore...
- Cold sore...

25:35.811 --> 25:36.946
- And gave herself...
- And gave herself...

25:36.979 --> 25:38.514
Herpes.

25:38.547 --> 25:39.383
Herpes.

25:40.883 --> 25:41.717
Herpes.

25:43.786 --> 25:44.954
Who are you?

25:50.026 --> 25:54.063
I'm Dane Marbeck and I
can communicate with ghosts.

25:58.567 --> 25:59.869
Ow, what are you doing?!

25:59.902 --> 26:01.137
First, you come in here

26:01.170 --> 26:02.338
and you tell me my
brother's missing,

26:02.371 --> 26:04.540
then you say you
can talk to ghosts?

26:04.573 --> 26:06.042
What is wrong with you?

26:06.075 --> 26:08.511
Ow, what's wrong with you?!

26:11.547 --> 26:12.382
Ow.

26:15.685 --> 26:17.687
Tell her I still have it.

26:17.720 --> 26:18.921
He still has it.

26:18.955 --> 26:20.390
What?

26:20.424 --> 26:22.825
- The doll, the Russian doll.
- Doll, the Russian doll.

26:22.858 --> 26:24.760
- It's in my drawers.
- It's in his drawers.

26:24.794 --> 26:26.329
- Third one down.
- Third down.

26:26.362 --> 26:27.730
- Left hand side.
- Left hand side.

26:27.763 --> 26:29.231
- At the back.
- At the back.

26:29.265 --> 26:31.667
Left hand side at the back.

26:36.205 --> 26:38.708
Your sister is something else.

26:45.748 --> 26:48.150
I was gonna make a hot cocoa.

26:48.184 --> 26:49.685
Did you want one?

26:49.719 --> 26:50.853
No, Marbeck,

26:50.886 --> 26:52.688
give her the evidence,
get outta here.

26:52.722 --> 26:56.659
I would love one, but
I've got some evidence.

27:01.530 --> 27:02.965
I took it out of
its plastic bag.

27:08.070 --> 27:09.572
Danny J. Wolf,

27:09.605 --> 27:11.240
Francis Tawhera,

27:11.273 --> 27:12.641
Trent Whiting,

27:12.675 --> 27:14.310
Ian McGregor,

27:14.343 --> 27:16.012
Samar Prakesh,

27:16.045 --> 27:18.382
and our first victim
killed two years ago,

27:18.415 --> 27:19.715
Khalid Kattan.

27:19.749 --> 27:21.584
And now, Jayson Tagg...

27:22.752 --> 27:24.653
Of the Aotearoa
Police Service.

27:27.023 --> 27:28.858
They're all different
ethnicities obviously,

27:28.891 --> 27:30.860
but we do have a
similar body type,

27:30.893 --> 27:34.630
so Samar and Francis
went to the same gym.

27:34.663 --> 27:36.599
Rule number
one, find a motive...

27:36.632 --> 27:37.867
Danny was a cross
fit instructor.

27:37.900 --> 27:39.201
Which has proven
impossible so far.

27:39.235 --> 27:41.771
Apart from that,
there's no trend.

27:41.804 --> 27:42.638
Okay.

27:44.106 --> 27:48.844
Is it a trend that they all
kinda look like they're gay?

27:48.878 --> 27:49.779
What do you mean?

27:49.812 --> 27:51.047
Yeah, what do you mean?

27:51.080 --> 27:53.517
I was just saying all
these guys could be gay.

27:53.549 --> 27:54.850
Like I mean you're gay, right?

27:54.884 --> 27:56.152
Yeah, everyone knew he was.

27:56.185 --> 27:57.319
No one, no they didn't.

27:57.353 --> 27:59.088
He tried to be straight
presenting when he was younger,

27:59.121 --> 28:02.191
but he could never really
finish with his girlfriends.

28:02.224 --> 28:03.125
What?

28:03.159 --> 28:04.060
How do you know about that?

28:04.093 --> 28:06.128
People talked about that?

28:06.162 --> 28:07.663
Of course.

28:07.696 --> 28:09.665
They were all gay.

28:09.698 --> 28:12.068
So where do gay men congregate?

28:12.101 --> 28:14.837
Well, anywhere
really, isn't it?

28:14.870 --> 28:16.105
Okay, let me rephrase that.

28:16.138 --> 28:17.840
Where do gay men who
are body obsessed

28:17.873 --> 28:21.977
and like other men looking
at their bodies congregate?

28:22.011 --> 28:23.145
Tagg?

28:23.179 --> 28:24.481
I don't know.

28:24.514 --> 28:25.681
He doesn't know.

28:25.714 --> 28:26.615
Come on.

28:26.649 --> 28:29.652
Well, we need to follow this up.

28:29.685 --> 28:31.187
Oh no, I'm done.

28:32.755 --> 28:34.190
Excuse me?

28:34.223 --> 28:37.226
Tagg just wanted me to bring
the evidence and I'm done.

28:37.259 --> 28:38.360
I'm finished.

28:45.167 --> 28:46.669
You're not done.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.971
I'm not done?

28:49.004 --> 28:51.640
You're seeing this through.

28:51.674 --> 28:53.008
I'm seeing this through?

28:53.042 --> 28:53.876
Tell me.

28:56.112 --> 28:58.280
I'm not done here,
I'm seeing this through.

28:58.314 --> 29:01.183
Uh-huh Good boy.

29:03.953 --> 29:05.354
I do know.

29:17.099 --> 29:18.767
Why have we stopped?

29:20.369 --> 29:22.539
We've run out of petrol.

29:23.672 --> 29:24.874
We've gone about 20 meters.

29:24.907 --> 29:26.443
Yeah, I know.

29:26.476 --> 29:28.378
- We're walking.
- I should have filled it up.

29:28.411 --> 29:29.546
- You should have, yup.
- Tagg,

29:29.579 --> 29:32.114
do I just leave this here?

29:32.148 --> 29:34.584
Will it be safe though
in your neighborhood?

Hey, what's the
deal with Yana, bro?

29:48.731 --> 29:50.699
What do you mean
the deal with her?

29:50.733 --> 29:53.102
Well, you know, she's
pretty full on, eh?

29:53.135 --> 29:55.237
I mean, I like her a lot.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.376
I mean, would she ever be
interested in someone like me,

29:59.409 --> 30:01.076
do you reckon, mate?

30:02.278 --> 30:03.712
Probably not, eh?

30:03.746 --> 30:06.081
I mean, I'm no Bradley Pitt, so.

30:06.115 --> 30:08.217
Hey!

30:08.250 --> 30:09.084
Hey, man.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.922
I almost had a girlfriend once.

30:12.955 --> 30:14.156
Wow, look at you.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.659
Thanks, man.

30:15.691 --> 30:16.725
Hello.

30:16.759 --> 30:18.327
Yeah.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.062
Her name was Henna.

30:20.095 --> 30:23.533
Her name was in the hospital
the same time my dad was.

30:23.567 --> 30:25.234
- Hey, do you have a lighter?
- God.

30:28.237 --> 30:29.238
Thank you.

30:30.372 --> 30:31.707
Nice earrings.

30:32.942 --> 30:33.776
My mum.

30:35.044 --> 30:36.613
She was more like
a friend I guess.

30:36.646 --> 30:38.347
She got on really
well with my mum.

30:38.381 --> 30:41.016
And then one day, like I was like
oh, I was looking into her eyes

30:41.050 --> 30:42.751
and she had like the
most amazing gray eyes,

30:42.785 --> 30:44.019
like kind of henna colored,

30:44.053 --> 30:46.222
and I was like what,
her name was Henna.

30:46.255 --> 30:48.958
Her name was Henna but
her eye color was henna.

30:48.991 --> 30:50.560
I was like what?

30:50.594 --> 30:52.795
Henna's brown, Marbeck.

30:52.828 --> 30:55.398
Yeah, but then I
was like oh, Marbles,

30:55.432 --> 30:56.865
you've made the rookie mistake.

30:56.899 --> 30:59.569
You've fallen in love,
mate, with your best friend.

30:59.603 --> 31:02.137
No.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.240
Bad move.

31:07.309 --> 31:08.545
Well, what happened?

31:08.578 --> 31:09.778
What?

31:09.812 --> 31:10.879
Yeah, with the
girl, what happened?

31:10.913 --> 31:12.449
Oh, I confessed my love.

31:12.482 --> 31:13.949
Oh man.

31:13.983 --> 31:15.284
Right, and she was disgusted?

31:15.317 --> 31:16.085
Yeah.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.556
But then her mum
died really suddenly

31:19.589 --> 31:22.091
and she just couldn't handle it.

31:22.124 --> 31:24.226
She got into this
really weird goth phase.

31:24.260 --> 31:27.796
She was like really
obsessed with death.

31:27.830 --> 31:30.734
I didn't really hang
out with her after that.

31:30.766 --> 31:34.303
Dad actually died before I even
got a chance to say goodbye,

31:34.336 --> 31:36.740
so I think maybe I was experimenting
with his old medication

31:36.772 --> 31:40.109
as a way to get kinda
close to him kinda thing.

31:53.523 --> 31:55.824
And that's when I discovered,

31:55.858 --> 31:57.092
well, you know.

32:21.950 --> 32:23.285
But then a couple years later,

32:23.319 --> 32:25.321
I found out that she
was actually a lesbian,

32:25.354 --> 32:26.855
so she had come
out as a lesbian,

32:26.889 --> 32:29.058
and I was like aw, even if
I look like Matthew Damon,

32:29.091 --> 32:31.093
she wouldn't have even
been interested in me.

32:31.126 --> 32:31.927
You know what I mean?

32:31.960 --> 32:32.762
Aw yeah.

32:32.796 --> 32:33.630
So...

32:35.030 --> 32:36.899
And hey bro, what
was that doll thing,

32:36.932 --> 32:39.001
that story about you and
Yana and the doll thing?

32:39.034 --> 32:39.968
What was that?

32:40.002 --> 32:41.671
Yana gave it to me.

32:41.705 --> 32:42.938
Amazing.

32:42.971 --> 32:44.840
Like when you were
kids or something?

32:44.873 --> 32:47.910
Yeah, after
something bad happened.

32:47.943 --> 32:49.211
Wow.

32:49.244 --> 32:51.280
What happened, man?

32:51.313 --> 32:53.882
We're not gonna talk about
that kinda thing, okay?

32:53.916 --> 32:55.552
We're not friends, Marbeck.

32:55.585 --> 32:56.786
You're helping me on a case.

32:56.820 --> 32:58.053
That's it.

32:58.087 --> 32:59.254
I never said we
were friends, bro.

32:59.288 --> 33:00.523
Jeez.

33:00.557 --> 33:02.224
I just wanted to get
some rapport going.

33:02.257 --> 33:03.660
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

33:03.693 --> 33:04.960
- How's it going?
- Good, thank you.

33:04.993 --> 33:08.097
Hey, we're looking for someone.

33:08.130 --> 33:09.699
What's your type?

33:11.434 --> 33:14.970
Not to play with.

33:15.003 --> 33:15.772
Ooh.

33:15.805 --> 33:16.706
Shame.

33:16.740 --> 33:20.342
No, no.

33:20.377 --> 33:22.044
I've done a little rendition.

33:22.077 --> 33:24.947
So have you seen
this guy around here?

33:24.980 --> 33:28.518
He's about five foot
10, wears a hood.

33:28.551 --> 33:29.786
That's not a mouth.

33:29.819 --> 33:32.354
That is a bandana
around his mouth.

33:32.389 --> 33:34.123
Do you recognize him?

33:35.124 --> 33:35.924
No.

33:35.958 --> 33:36.793
Marbeck!

33:37.761 --> 33:38.561
Oh sorry, bro.

33:38.595 --> 33:39.396
I'll come back.

33:39.429 --> 33:40.262
I'll just, hang on.

33:40.295 --> 33:41.263
I'm coming, mate!

33:42.599 --> 33:43.800
All right, young man?

33:43.833 --> 33:46.001
Ooh a lot of heft
to you, isn't there!

33:46.034 --> 33:47.369
Marbeck, come on!

33:47.404 --> 33:48.605
Wowee.

33:48.638 --> 33:49.839
Hurry up,
he's getting away!

33:49.873 --> 33:50.673
I've got to go.

33:50.707 --> 33:51.508
Sorry, sir.

33:51.541 --> 33:54.176
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:54.209 --> 33:55.645
Marbeck, come on.

33:55.678 --> 33:57.547
Lloyd Llewellyn, I run a
talent agency for male talent.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.482
I'm always looking
for more bodies.

33:59.516 --> 34:00.315
Forget that guy!

34:00.349 --> 34:01.851
Come on!

34:01.885 --> 34:02.951
Sorry.

34:12.661 --> 34:14.664
You don't need to be quiet bro.

34:14.697 --> 34:15.998
Okay, you're right,
you're right, okay.

34:16.031 --> 34:17.801
Let's split up and
when I see him,

34:17.833 --> 34:18.701
I'll yell back to you.

34:18.735 --> 34:19.668
Okay.

34:19.702 --> 34:20.870
Well no, Tagg,

34:20.904 --> 34:22.004
no, no, no, I don't
think it's a...

34:24.641 --> 34:26.007
Oh, oh god.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.377
Marbles,
I think I see him!

34:27.409 --> 34:29.478
He's southwest of you!

34:29.512 --> 34:31.514
Where's southwest?

34:31.547 --> 34:33.982
Go, hurry up
or he's gonna get away!

34:34.016 --> 34:35.819
Marbeck, 219!

34:35.851 --> 34:37.252
219!

34:37.286 --> 34:38.822
Okay, what's a 219?

34:38.855 --> 34:41.123
I don't know what a 219 is!

34:48.096 --> 34:48.898
What are you doing?

34:48.931 --> 34:50.165
I said southwest!

34:50.199 --> 34:52.601
I don't know where
southwest is, Tagg!

34:52.635 --> 34:53.469
Hey!

34:57.105 --> 34:57.907
Oh my god.

34:57.941 --> 34:59.709
No, no, no, no, no, no!

34:59.742 --> 35:03.580
Oh my god!

35:03.613 --> 35:04.647
Oh my god, Tagg!

35:04.681 --> 35:06.683
Marbles, go up to him!

35:12.622 --> 35:14.757
Yeah!

35:14.791 --> 35:15.692
Nice!

35:15.725 --> 35:16.826
I don't feel so good, Tagg.

35:16.860 --> 35:17.861
What?

35:17.894 --> 35:19.027
No, you're joking me.

35:19.061 --> 35:20.396
Come on, Marbeck.

35:20.430 --> 35:22.197
No, Marbeck.

35:22.231 --> 35:23.065
Come on.

35:23.933 --> 35:24.767
No.

35:27.336 --> 35:28.538
Oh god.

36:57.125 --> 36:57.961
Khalid?

37:21.216 --> 37:22.217
It's Jayson.

37:23.419 --> 37:28.190
It's Jayson Tagg of the
Aotearoa Police Service.

37:33.295 --> 37:34.864
Oh, Tagg, no!

37:34.897 --> 37:35.698
What?

37:38.868 --> 37:41.269
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

37:50.178 --> 37:51.014
Run, run!

37:53.616 --> 37:55.250
Come on, mate.

38:03.026 --> 38:05.828

38:21.878 --> 38:23.079
- Ghoul?
- Yeah.

38:23.112 --> 38:25.782
Yeah, I used to
buy coffee from him.

38:25.815 --> 38:26.749
He was the first victim.

38:26.783 --> 38:28.350
He died about two years ago.

38:28.384 --> 38:29.585
Okay.

38:29.619 --> 38:30.753
He didn't want to
pass over obviously,

38:30.787 --> 38:33.288
so he's turned
into a ghoul, mate.

38:33.321 --> 38:35.625
What did he do to me?

38:35.658 --> 38:36.826
Okay, so, okay.

38:36.859 --> 38:40.163
You know bananas, right,
when they go black...

38:40.195 --> 38:41.531
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

38:41.564 --> 38:42.398
Hey.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.636
Okay, so you know bananas
when they go black, mate,

38:46.669 --> 38:47.870
and then they touch
another banana

38:47.904 --> 38:49.639
and then it goes fast to black?

38:49.672 --> 38:53.743
Right, I think that's the
best metaphor I've got.

38:55.078 --> 38:56.713
Ah, Marbeck.

38:58.648 --> 39:00.183
Oh my god, yeah.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.552
How long until
that happens to me?

39:02.585 --> 39:04.020
I don't know, man.

39:04.053 --> 39:07.355
Like maybe a month or maybe
less now that he's touched you.

39:07.390 --> 39:08.791
- A month?
- Yeah.

39:10.593 --> 39:12.260

Hi, darling!

39:33.049 --> 39:34.282
What are you doing?

39:34.316 --> 39:36.986
I'm letting off a
little bit of steam.

39:37.019 --> 39:37.920
Okay.

39:37.954 --> 39:39.989
I need to find a new man.

39:40.022 --> 39:44.627
Well, mum, I think you're
in the wrong club for that.

39:45.895 --> 39:48.498
Oh, I could get used to you.

39:48.531 --> 39:51.167
Okay, mum, I reckon
we should go now, mum.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.436
I'm sorry, mate.
Mum, I think we should go home, mother.

39:53.469 --> 39:54.937
Do you work out?

39:54.971 --> 39:56.572
What's your name?

39:56.606 --> 39:59.041
Please don't make fun of me.

39:59.075 --> 40:01.778
I just
want another man.

40:01.811 --> 40:03.446

Hey, man.

40:10.586 --> 40:11.420
Marbles?

40:13.689 --> 40:14.891
Xavier, hi.

40:14.924 --> 40:16.225
You didn't come to
my birthday party.

40:16.259 --> 40:17.660
Oh, was that today?

40:17.693 --> 40:20.295
Oh, sorry, yeah, my mum's sick.

40:21.597 --> 40:22.999
What are you doing here, bro?

40:23.032 --> 40:24.299
What are you doing here?

40:24.332 --> 40:26.002
I'm gonna take my mum home.

40:26.035 --> 40:27.170
She's had a big night.

40:27.203 --> 40:29.005
Oh, well I can take her.

40:29.038 --> 40:30.106
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:30.139 --> 40:30.940
Yeah, sure.

40:30.973 --> 40:32.175
No, say no to this.

40:32.208 --> 40:34.710
Oh, no, nah, nah, it's okay.

40:34.744 --> 40:36.913
It's fine, I'll take her.

40:36.946 --> 40:38.447
Do you want to use my car?

40:38.481 --> 40:39.849
It's the red one.

40:39.882 --> 40:42.852
- Oh, I don't know.
- This, you can say yes to.

40:44.120 --> 40:44.921
Yeah, okay.

40:44.954 --> 40:45.755
Thanks, man.

40:45.788 --> 40:46.989
That's so helpful.

40:47.023 --> 40:49.826
I'll get the car back
to you tonight, I guess.

40:49.859 --> 40:52.128
- Take care.
- Thanks, mate.

40:57.767 --> 41:01.369
I'm sorry I didn't
catch the hoodie.

41:01.404 --> 41:03.072
Ah, you gave it a good go.

41:03.105 --> 41:05.975
I was so close and
then I just fluffed it.

41:06.008 --> 41:08.377
You're not a complete loser.

41:08.411 --> 41:11.180
I never said I was a loser.

41:11.214 --> 41:13.382
Right, no, yeah, of course.

41:13.416 --> 41:15.718
And plus, hey, she
put up a good fight.

41:15.751 --> 41:16.552
She?

41:16.586 --> 41:17.486
Right, yeah.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.856
The hoodie's a woman.

41:19.889 --> 41:20.690
Wow.

41:22.357 --> 41:24.260
Are you all right, mum?

41:33.502 --> 41:34.303
Don't worry, mate.

41:34.337 --> 41:35.137
I'll clean that up.

41:35.171 --> 41:37.106
Okay, you'll, I won't.

41:37.139 --> 41:38.274
No, don't worry about it, man.

41:38.307 --> 41:39.942
I've got it.

41:39.976 --> 41:44.013
You probably can't anyway
'cause you're a ghost.

42:00.529 --> 42:01.497
Here you go.

42:07.069 --> 42:08.471
Come on, mum.

42:13.042 --> 42:14.510
Okay, here you go.

42:23.586 --> 42:24.420
Ross.

42:30.993 --> 42:33.596
Took you for granted, didn't I?

42:34.864 --> 42:35.698
I'm sorry.

42:37.867 --> 42:38.801
I miss you.

42:40.970 --> 42:41.904
I miss you.

43:10.166 --> 43:12.568
Do you have to do that now?

43:14.404 --> 43:16.205
It helps me see you, man.

43:16.238 --> 43:17.873
That's not helping you see me.

43:17.907 --> 43:22.211
Oh not this joint, but
marijuana in general.

43:22.244 --> 43:23.145
I'm just saying look,

43:23.179 --> 43:24.880
I mean, if you didn't do that,

43:24.914 --> 43:26.782
maybe you wouldn't
be such a loser.

43:26.816 --> 43:28.517
What is all this
loser talk, bro?

43:28.551 --> 43:29.819
Well, look where you live.

43:29.852 --> 43:30.686
You never have any money.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.121
Look how you dress.

43:32.154 --> 43:33.889
I mean, look how you present
yourself to the world.

43:33.923 --> 43:35.758
Your only friend
is a drug dealer

43:35.791 --> 43:38.894
and you didn't even make
it to his birthday party.

43:38.928 --> 43:40.329
Wow, okay, wow.

43:45.469 --> 43:47.770
Look, I'm not saying any
of this to criticize you.

43:47.803 --> 43:49.772
You're not criticizing me?

43:49.805 --> 43:51.307
Are you building me up, bro?

43:51.340 --> 43:54.910
I'm just saying
untapped potential.

43:54.944 --> 43:56.512
Like the fish in the tree,

43:56.545 --> 43:57.980
climbing the tree.

43:58.014 --> 44:00.049
Is that how it goes?

44:00.082 --> 44:02.818
Fuck, man, I'm so bagged.

44:02.852 --> 44:04.720
I just want to chill out.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.681
Holy shit.

44:39.489 --> 44:40.322
What?

44:43.659 --> 44:47.263
Marbeck, what the
hell is inside my body?

44:51.401 --> 44:52.234
Hey!

44:55.905 --> 44:57.306
Hey!

45:43.786 --> 45:45.221
Hey!

46:14.518 --> 46:16.051
Oh no.

46:22.992 --> 46:25.428
Something was in me, Marbeck.

46:25.462 --> 46:27.963
It was like it was wearing me.

46:30.099 --> 46:31.934
What, like clothes?

46:31.967 --> 46:33.969
Okay, so the
hoodie's taking people.

46:34.003 --> 46:35.671
I've never seen this
sort of thing before.

46:35.704 --> 46:37.907
And possessing them.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.376
I mean, I've
been seeing ghosts

46:39.409 --> 46:41.378
for the last two years
since dad's funeral, but...

46:41.411 --> 46:43.946
Unless she's working
for somebody else.

46:43.979 --> 46:47.716
I've never seen a dead
body come back, man.

46:48.918 --> 46:50.753
I shouldn't have chased it.
I scared it.

46:52.021 --> 46:52.922
That's all right, bro.

46:52.955 --> 46:55.324
This sort of thing happens.

46:55.357 --> 46:56.192
Does it?

46:57.394 --> 46:58.961
Yeah, maybe
not.

46:58.994 --> 47:01.498
Well, you're gonna have
to break the news to Yana, Marbeck.

47:01.531 --> 47:04.133
Her brother is definitely dead.

47:05.502 --> 47:07.269
Hey, bro, do you mind
if we actually move on?

47:07.303 --> 47:09.271
I'm worried that a jogger
might see me with a dead body.

47:09.305 --> 47:10.105
Is that cool?

47:10.139 --> 47:10.940
Yeah.

47:10.973 --> 47:11.941
Thanks.

47:11.974 --> 47:13.175
And hey, if it's
any consolation,

47:13.209 --> 47:14.910
you're looking so
buff, your body.

47:14.944 --> 47:16.078
Those biceps, man.

47:16.111 --> 47:19.148
You're gonna look
amazing at your funeral.

47:19.181 --> 47:20.349
Thanks.

47:20.383 --> 47:21.484
No problem.

47:30.159 --> 47:31.727
Yana, we're home.

47:32.861 --> 47:35.364
I knocked but nobody answered.

47:36.799 --> 47:37.933
Oh no.

47:37.967 --> 47:38.867
Oh, shit.

47:41.638 --> 47:42.539
I'll, yeah.

47:47.510 --> 47:48.744
Sorry.

47:48.777 --> 47:49.613
Sorry.

47:51.581 --> 47:52.649
Sorry, sorry.

47:56.519 --> 48:00.756
I don't know what's safe
to touch and help to...

48:00.789 --> 48:01.991
Hang on.

48:02.024 --> 48:04.026
Her shoulder's okay, eh?

48:05.160 --> 48:06.962
So, this means the
killer's still at large

48:06.996 --> 48:08.897
and another victim's on its way?

48:08.931 --> 48:11.300
Yeah, I guess so.

48:11.333 --> 48:13.202
But I reckon that we
should be more focused

48:13.235 --> 48:14.970
on saying our goodbyes.

48:15.004 --> 48:15.938
No, not yet.

48:15.971 --> 48:18.073
At least stay for breakfast.

48:18.107 --> 48:21.043
Oh no, I mean goodbyes
between you two.

48:21.076 --> 48:22.911
You know, I said no.

48:28.350 --> 48:31.421
It's pretty dangerous,
but do you want to try it?

48:31.454 --> 48:33.456
Has anyone besides
you taken it?

48:33.490 --> 48:34.691
I tried to get my mum to

48:34.724 --> 48:37.026
but she freaked out
about what was in it.

48:37.059 --> 48:39.895
Neurological
medication and pot?

48:40.996 --> 48:43.198
Marijuana, yeah.

48:43.232 --> 48:44.668
Is Jayson here?

48:46.368 --> 48:48.203
He's just here.

48:48.237 --> 48:52.875
Do you have any final things
you want to say to him?

48:52.908 --> 48:54.678
I don't want to risk it.

48:54.711 --> 48:57.880
He knows I love him and shit.

48:57.913 --> 49:01.183
Oh my god.

49:04.086 --> 49:05.722
I've seen this insignia before.

49:05.755 --> 49:07.590
- Insignia.
- Insignia.

49:10.359 --> 49:12.227
- No way!
- No way what?

49:12.261 --> 49:13.162
What no way?

49:13.195 --> 49:14.497
Samar is on Lloyd Llewellyn's

49:14.531 --> 49:16.298
Gentleman's Club website,

49:16.332 --> 49:17.966
but he's got a stage name.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.502
The heavy pipe layer.

49:19.536 --> 49:20.770
And guess what?

49:20.804 --> 49:22.439
Am I actually gonna guess?

49:22.472 --> 49:24.873
Ian McGregor and Danny
J. Wolf are on there too,

49:24.907 --> 49:26.409
again with the pseudonyms

49:26.443 --> 49:29.479
which will be why it never
showed up on my research.

49:29.512 --> 49:30.747
Okay, well what
about the others?

49:30.780 --> 49:32.649
Okay, what about the others?

49:32.682 --> 49:34.484
No, not that I
can see yet, no.

49:34.517 --> 49:36.619
No, not that she can see yet.

49:36.653 --> 49:37.454
Yeah, I heard her.

49:37.487 --> 49:39.689
Thank you, Marbeck.

49:39.723 --> 49:41.624
So what are you
thinking, buddy?

49:41.658 --> 49:45.729
I'm thinking our bodies might
be being used as sex slaves.

49:45.762 --> 49:48.364
What, your body's
been used for sex?

49:48.398 --> 49:49.599
That'd make sense.

49:49.632 --> 49:52.201
Yeah, it would make sense.

49:52.234 --> 49:53.803
That guy, Llewellyn,

49:53.837 --> 49:56.872
and that hoodie were both at
the gay bar at the same time!

49:56.905 --> 49:59.509
I think I know
what you're on about.

49:59.542 --> 50:02.177
You need to do an undercover
reconnaissance mission.

50:02.211 --> 50:02.878
What, no.

50:02.911 --> 50:04.113
Can't we just call the cops now?

50:04.146 --> 50:05.013
No cops.

50:05.047 --> 50:05.948
Trust me.

50:05.981 --> 50:08.050
I know the justice system.

50:09.218 --> 50:13.322
I don't think we've
got that kinda time.

50:13.355 --> 50:14.957
Okay.

50:14.990 --> 50:18.428
Looks like I'm going on
a recononsense mission.

50:18.461 --> 50:19.294
Close.

50:22.499 --> 50:25.668
Someone was following
me last night.

50:28.036 --> 50:28.872
Dane.

50:31.173 --> 50:33.342
Okay, okay, I'll be there.

50:34.778 --> 50:38.013
I just need to do
something first.

50:49.191 --> 50:50.359
You know, this line
of Kimberly range

50:50.393 --> 50:52.961
will suit your
complexion just fine.

50:53.962 --> 50:55.063
I haven't done anything yet.

50:55.097 --> 50:56.365
Okay.

50:56.399 --> 50:58.768
Hey, does Tagg have
any other size shirts?

50:58.802 --> 51:01.336
No, he likes them
like that, tight.

51:01.370 --> 51:02.906
Mm-hmm.

51:02.938 --> 51:05.575
Maybe you could
come along with us.

51:05.608 --> 51:06.843
I'd love to.

51:06.876 --> 51:08.343
GPS.

51:08.378 --> 51:10.580
The cops would be on my ass
if I leave the property.

51:10.613 --> 51:12.147
Okay.

51:12.181 --> 51:14.316
Hey, could I just wear my
camo shirt to this, Tagg?

51:14.349 --> 51:15.284
No, no,

51:15.317 --> 51:16.586
you have to look like somebody

51:16.619 --> 51:18.153
someone would want
to have sex with.

51:18.187 --> 51:20.623
Trust me, you put that on,

51:20.657 --> 51:22.659
you'll feel sexy.

51:29.933 --> 51:33.135

- Hello?
- Hi.

51:47.851 --> 51:51.153
I'm just a uni student wanting
to make some extra cash.

51:51.186 --> 51:53.923
Turn to your left.

51:53.957 --> 51:55.458
And to your right.

51:57.460 --> 51:59.094
I think you'll have better
luck somewhere else.

51:59.127 --> 52:01.263
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
I need to get in.

52:01.296 --> 52:02.097
No, no, no.

52:02.130 --> 52:04.767
Bummer.

52:08.471 --> 52:11.407
I don't think I can do it, Tagg.

52:11.441 --> 52:13.476
You can do it, Marbles.

52:16.946 --> 52:20.182
Okay, I just reckon that
I need a bit of a runner.

52:20.215 --> 52:21.885
You can do this, Marbles!

52:24.621 --> 52:25.622
There he is.

52:28.725 --> 52:30.560
This is definitely the sort
of the place I'll move into

52:30.593 --> 52:32.160
once I move out
of my granny flat.

52:32.194 --> 52:33.028
Yeah.

52:36.265 --> 52:37.065
What?

52:37.099 --> 52:37.934
Nothing.

52:38.701 --> 52:40.035
Why were you looking
at me like that?

52:40.068 --> 52:42.237
No, it's just, I was just
wondering how possession works.

52:42.271 --> 52:43.071
That's all.

52:43.105 --> 52:43.907
Nothing.

52:43.940 --> 52:45.408
Okay.

52:45.441 --> 52:47.109
Well, I think like a ghost
steps out of their body

52:47.142 --> 52:49.512
and then it becomes a
vessel for another ghost,

52:49.546 --> 52:50.380
I presume.

52:51.748 --> 52:52.582
Maybe,

52:53.783 --> 52:55.050
nah, nothing.

52:55.083 --> 52:56.251
What?

52:56.285 --> 52:58.086
I'm just thinking
maybe we should try it.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.656
You and me?

52:59.689 --> 53:01.123
Is that so bad?

53:01.156 --> 53:03.793
No, I don't want to be
a ghost outside my body.

53:03.826 --> 53:06.563
Five minutes tops and
then I'll give it back.

53:06.596 --> 53:10.533
Why do you suddenly
want to be in me so much?

53:10.567 --> 53:13.703
Might be fun to try it, that's all.
But fine, don't worry about it.

53:13.736 --> 53:15.405
Look, can we just focus
on the task at hand?

53:15.438 --> 53:16.639
Yeah, of course.

53:16.673 --> 53:18.641
Excuse me, I can see you!

53:18.675 --> 53:21.377
You're right there
on my property!

53:21.411 --> 53:23.046
Come here!

53:23.078 --> 53:24.881
Okay, make him want you.

53:24.914 --> 53:27.417
You are a sexy uni
student out of work, yeah?

53:27.450 --> 53:28.484
Yeah.

53:28.518 --> 53:29.318
What?

53:29.351 --> 53:30.486
Okay.

53:30.520 --> 53:31.353
Walk with confidence.

53:31.387 --> 53:32.722
Come on, chin up high.

53:32.755 --> 53:34.757
That's it, strut a little bit.

53:34.791 --> 53:36.191
Hey, man.

53:36.224 --> 53:39.963
I'm just a uni student looking
to make some extra cash.

53:39.996 --> 53:42.031
Bend your legs or something.

53:42.065 --> 53:43.433
I don't think so.

53:43.466 --> 53:44.801
- What, no, I...
- Confidence.

53:44.834 --> 53:45.935
Don't take no for an answer.

53:45.969 --> 53:48.203
Yeah, well I do think so.

53:49.439 --> 53:52.240
Look, I always
have today off, okay?

53:52.274 --> 53:53.076
Okay.

53:53.108 --> 53:54.010
I don't know.

53:54.043 --> 53:55.177
Tell him you'll do anything.

53:55.210 --> 53:56.779
I'll do anything.

53:59.015 --> 54:00.550
What kind of anything?

54:00.583 --> 54:01.918
You name it, you'll do it.

54:01.951 --> 54:04.053
You name it, you'll do it.

54:04.087 --> 54:05.755
I mean, sorry, yeah.

54:06.789 --> 54:09.124
You name it, I'll do it, so.

54:10.994 --> 54:12.595
Wait, I think I...

54:12.629 --> 54:13.429
What?

54:13.463 --> 54:14.296
Shit.

54:14.329 --> 54:15.632
Shit, oh shit.

54:16.666 --> 54:19.869
I'll shit for you.

54:22.405 --> 54:24.107
I tell you what.

54:24.139 --> 54:25.608
Yeah?

54:25.642 --> 54:30.312
Come around the back and
we'll discuss your potential.

54:31.481 --> 54:34.917
Great.

54:34.951 --> 54:36.218
Samar, Samar?

54:39.287 --> 54:41.124
It is Samar, isn't it?

54:42.058 --> 54:42.892
Can you,

54:43.726 --> 54:44.560
Samar?

54:48.263 --> 54:49.331
It's Samar.

54:51.134 --> 54:53.368
Samar, right, sorry.

54:53.403 --> 54:54.871
You look like shit.

54:54.904 --> 54:57.372
You've only been dead a week.

54:57.407 --> 54:59.008
You?

54:59.042 --> 55:01.176
I'm dead too, yeah.

55:01.209 --> 55:02.545
I'm a ghost too.

55:04.013 --> 55:06.115
Sorry for you.

55:06.149 --> 55:09.952
Listen, I'm trying to find the
person responsible for our deaths.

55:09.986 --> 55:11.319
A girl in a hood.

55:11.353 --> 55:12.755
Can you remember?

55:14.891 --> 55:16.324
Yes.

55:16.358 --> 55:18.461
Yes, she had
something to do with it?

55:18.494 --> 55:19.696
Who was she?

55:19.729 --> 55:22.799
Did she work for this
Lloyd Llewellyn guy?

55:29.672 --> 55:32.240
♪ Ooh, sexy man ♪

55:32.274 --> 55:33.576
Come to daddy.

55:35.343 --> 55:38.181

make all your lads do?

55:38.213 --> 55:39.816
Make them do?

55:39.849 --> 55:42.485
I'm not making
anyone do anything.

55:42.518 --> 55:43.686
Nothing I do is illegal.

55:43.720 --> 55:45.788
I wouldn't make
anyone do anything.

55:45.822 --> 55:47.957
Well it's a bit like
herding sheep, isn't it?

55:47.990 --> 55:49.992
It's not like you're making
them go through the gate,

55:50.026 --> 55:52.595
but when you've got
a dog barking at them

55:52.628 --> 55:54.664
and there's only one
space for them to go to,

55:54.697 --> 55:56.933
there's not much choice.

55:56.966 --> 55:58.167
Shush.

55:58.201 --> 56:00.703
It's always better
when you don't talk.

56:00.737 --> 56:03.305
Me specifically or your lads?

56:04.239 --> 56:05.074
My lads.

56:07.410 --> 56:09.479
Do you prefer them just
to be bodies, do you?

56:09.512 --> 56:11.346
Something like that.

56:13.683 --> 56:15.017
She was angry.

56:16.819 --> 56:19.021
She was angry, okay.

56:19.055 --> 56:19.889
Why?

56:21.691 --> 56:22.792
Can you tell me
anything about her?

56:22.825 --> 56:23.926
Did she work here?

56:23.960 --> 56:26.361
Can you remember
anything else about her?

56:26.395 --> 56:28.064

56:42.845 --> 56:44.046

57:29.692 --> 57:32.428
Samar, we're just
in a field now.

57:32.461 --> 57:34.630
Are you staying with us?

57:35.798 --> 57:37.066
Staying with?

57:40.203 --> 57:41.037
Right, no.

58:02.225 --> 58:03.159
No, I know, I know.

58:03.192 --> 58:04.093
We'll find her, Marbles!

58:04.126 --> 58:05.228
Wait, who are these people?

58:05.261 --> 58:07.196
- Will you let me possess you?
- No!

58:07.230 --> 58:08.464
Please let me come inside you.

58:13.269 --> 58:14.670
Why not, Marbles?!

58:14.704 --> 58:15.738
Get away!

58:19.108 --> 58:20.409
Ow!

58:24.480 --> 58:27.483
Don't be afraid of him!

58:28.751 --> 58:30.219
That's it, fight him!

58:32.388 --> 58:33.589
Oh no, I think I hurt him!

58:33.623 --> 58:34.891
- Are you all right?
- What?!

58:34.924 --> 58:36.459
- No, what are you doing?
- I'm so sorry!

58:36.492 --> 58:37.693
Marbles!

58:41.030 --> 58:42.198
Just wait here.

58:42.231 --> 58:43.399
Oh my god!

58:43.432 --> 58:46.068
Keep away, keep
away from my friend!

58:48.004 --> 58:49.171
Keep away!

58:49.205 --> 58:50.006
No, no, no, no.

58:50.039 --> 58:50.840
We've got him.

58:50.873 --> 58:51.707

58:51.741 --> 58:53.075
Go away, Tagg!

58:54.944 --> 58:55.778
What?

58:56.846 --> 58:57.680
Henna?

58:59.548 --> 59:00.883
Wait,

59:00.917 --> 59:02.518
- what?!
- You know her?

59:02.551 --> 59:05.154
Wait, you're the one that's
been taking these guys?!

59:05.187 --> 59:06.122
What, she's the one,

59:06.155 --> 59:07.356
she's the girl you
were in love with?

59:07.391 --> 59:08.724
You wouldn't understand.

59:08.758 --> 59:10.092
That's so evil though, Henna.

59:10.126 --> 59:11.193
Don't worry about me.

59:11.227 --> 59:12.328
Go for her!

59:12.361 --> 59:13.796
I'm not leaving you, bro!

59:13.829 --> 59:14.964
They'll get you!

59:14.997 --> 59:16.465
Okay, go back!

59:16.499 --> 59:18.167
Who are you talking to?

59:18.200 --> 59:20.770
Why have you been doing it?

59:20.803 --> 59:22.071
Love.

59:22.104 --> 59:23.205
Love?

59:23.239 --> 59:24.307
What, for that guy?

59:24.340 --> 59:25.574
- What?
- What?

59:25.608 --> 59:27.109
No!

59:27.143 --> 59:27.977
My mum.

59:31.480 --> 59:34.116
- Marbles, go!
- I'm not going, Tagg!

59:34.150 --> 59:35.651
Look, I...

59:36.786 --> 59:37.586
Marbles, go!

59:37.620 --> 59:39.188
She's getting away!

59:41.157 --> 59:42.158
Yeah, go on, good.

59:42.191 --> 59:43.626
Get out of it!

59:43.659 --> 59:45.127
We've done it, bro.

59:45.161 --> 59:46.062
Go away!

59:46.095 --> 59:47.730
We haven't done it, Marbles!
It's her!

59:47.763 --> 59:50.400
Tagg, what are you doing, bro?

59:50.434 --> 59:51.534
Tagg!

59:51.567 --> 59:52.835
We're fine now.

59:52.868 --> 59:54.470
It's not him, it's her.

59:54.503 --> 59:55.604
It's not just him.

59:55.638 --> 59:56.806
Marbles, we have to get her.

59:56.839 --> 59:58.140
We have to get everybody.

59:58.174 --> 59:59.041
Okay, come on, bro.

59:59.075 --> 59:59.809
Let's go.

59:59.842 --> 01:00:01.043
Let's go and take Lloyd back.

01:00:01.077 --> 01:00:02.645
We'll call the police and
everything's done. Okay, bro?

01:00:02.678 --> 01:00:03.479
Let's go.

01:00:03.512 --> 01:00:05.247
No, Marbles.

01:00:05.281 --> 01:00:06.215
You've done it,

01:00:06.248 --> 01:00:07.350
you've done your job now,

01:00:07.384 --> 01:00:08.584
okay, bro?

01:00:08.617 --> 01:00:09.986
You need to go and
see Yana, okay?

01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:11.754
You need to say all the
things you never said

01:00:11.787 --> 01:00:12.688
so you can move on.

01:00:12.722 --> 01:00:14.458
No, it's not just about Yana!

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.159
You need to pass
over otherwise-

01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:19.095
I can already see it happening!

01:00:19.128 --> 01:00:20.464
You won't be you anymore.

01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:21.465
You don't understand.

01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:23.799
This is personal
for me, Marbles.

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.067
Okay.

01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:26.869
Khalid, Khalid,
the first victim,

01:00:26.902 --> 01:00:29.238
I knew him, I knew him well.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.273
Okay.

01:00:35.211 --> 01:00:36.912
What do you mean?

01:00:36.946 --> 01:00:39.449
Marbles, I'm finishing this,

01:00:41.485 --> 01:00:43.185
with or without you.

01:00:43.219 --> 01:00:44.020
No, Tagg.

01:00:44.053 --> 01:00:45.422
Come on, man.

01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:46.856
Tagg, man.

01:00:46.889 --> 01:00:47.690
No, Tagg, come on!

01:00:47.723 --> 01:00:48.657
Tagg, Tagg, Tagg, Tagg!

01:00:48.691 --> 01:00:50.192
Come on, no, Tagg!

01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:52.661
Shit.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.580
Tagg?

01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:13.249
No!

01:01:19.922 --> 01:01:21.525
Tagg, come on, man!

01:01:22.858 --> 01:01:23.692
Tagg!

01:01:46.483 --> 01:01:47.917
I found out that
Lloyd Llewellyn

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.653
has been misusing his
power for quite some time,

01:01:50.686 --> 01:01:52.822
but nothing illegal.

01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:54.356
What?

01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:57.726
And now, you've incriminated
yourself by assaulting him.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.627
Oh man.

01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:00.062
Is Jayson here?

01:02:01.565 --> 01:02:02.898
No.

01:02:02.932 --> 01:02:04.468
Where is he then?

01:02:05.535 --> 01:02:07.169
I don't know, man.

01:02:08.405 --> 01:02:09.939
He's passed over?

01:02:11.408 --> 01:02:13.109
As his friend like,

01:02:14.877 --> 01:02:16.078
I'd want to say yes,

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:17.481
but no, I think he's still
hanging around somewhere

01:02:17.514 --> 01:02:19.849
but I don't know where he is.

01:02:22.751 --> 01:02:25.354
I reckon he loved him.

01:02:25.388 --> 01:02:26.655
Who, what, who?

01:02:26.689 --> 01:02:27.491
Tagg,

01:02:27.524 --> 01:02:29.325
Tagg loved Khalid.

01:02:29.358 --> 01:02:30.594
They were dating for
a couple of months,

01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:32.128
but you know Tagg,

01:02:32.962 --> 01:02:35.030
too afraid to commit.

01:02:35.064 --> 01:02:37.099
Then a month later,

01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:38.701
Khalid disappeared.

01:02:40.302 --> 01:02:41.137
Damn.

01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:43.139
No resolution.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.742
I really wanted a climax.

01:02:46.775 --> 01:02:47.611
Yeah.

01:02:55.117 --> 01:02:56.218
What is it?

01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:04.760
Did you catch anything?

01:03:06.295 --> 01:03:07.796
I used to spend
hours down there

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.469
but I found out that there
weren't any fish in there.

01:03:12.502 --> 01:03:13.702
Oh.

01:03:13.736 --> 01:03:16.640
But once I buy the
place, I'll put fish in.

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:18.508
Sounds lovely.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:21.444
Your face sounds lovely.

01:03:21.478 --> 01:03:23.112
It is lovely.

01:03:23.145 --> 01:03:25.714
You just blurt
anything out, don't you?

01:03:25.748 --> 01:03:26.650
I try to.

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:31.454
You should try blurting
out once in a while.

01:03:33.822 --> 01:03:34.723
Blurt.

01:03:34.757 --> 01:03:36.258
Cocoa gives me the squirts.

01:03:36.292 --> 01:03:37.627
Oh.

01:03:37.661 --> 01:03:40.329
Nectarines do the same
but I call it the trots.

01:03:40.362 --> 01:03:42.298
The trots, I like it.

01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:47.836
I like the squirts.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.705
I remember that last
time I had the trots,

01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:51.541
I had two cups of cocoa

01:03:51.575 --> 01:03:53.510
and then went jumping
on my mini trampoline

01:03:53.543 --> 01:03:57.213
and then it all just
poured right out of me.

01:04:04.086 --> 01:04:05.522
Did you want to get that?

01:04:05.555 --> 01:04:06.889
No, it's fine.

01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:10.393
I might if that's...

01:04:10.427 --> 01:04:11.661
- Oh.
- Sorry.

01:04:11.695 --> 01:04:12.529
Nuh-uh.

01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:16.566
Mum?

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.833
Love,
can you come home?

01:04:17.866 --> 01:04:18.901
What, why?

01:04:18.934 --> 01:04:20.336
Something's happened.

01:04:20.369 --> 01:04:21.571
I need you.

01:04:21.605 --> 01:04:23.707
I'm kind of in the middle of
something at the moment, mum.

01:04:23.739 --> 01:04:25.341
What's more
important than your family?

01:04:25.374 --> 01:04:26.175
No, I'll come, mum.

01:04:26.208 --> 01:04:27.109
I'll come, I'll come.

01:04:27.142 --> 01:04:28.645
Thank you, thank you.

01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:29.845
Come now.

01:04:29.878 --> 01:04:31.313
Sorry.

01:04:31.347 --> 01:04:32.181
Marbles?

01:04:35.452 --> 01:04:36.553
Oh god.

01:04:36.586 --> 01:04:38.254
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

01:04:38.287 --> 01:04:39.121
I'm sorry.

01:04:40.457 --> 01:04:43.727
I've been having too
much for too long.

01:04:45.861 --> 01:04:47.363
You take the rest.

01:04:48.764 --> 01:04:52.368
You can use it if you
can feel Tagg around.

01:04:54.203 --> 01:04:56.706
I'll come back for my scooter.

01:05:33.108 --> 01:05:33.942
Khalid.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.349
Apparently,
according to Marbles,

01:05:43.118 --> 01:05:46.188
it's important that
I say something

01:05:46.221 --> 01:05:49.058
which is just quite
simply that I,

01:05:52.995 --> 01:05:56.332
you know, I liked
spending time with you,

01:05:56.365 --> 01:05:58.535
hanging out, you know,

01:05:58.568 --> 01:06:01.036
and I liked your
company and who you are.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:04.774
I think you're a good guy
but I loved you basically,

01:06:04.808 --> 01:06:05.608
or I still do,

01:06:05.642 --> 01:06:06.476
I still,

01:06:07.577 --> 01:06:09.011
I still love you.

01:06:45.047 --> 01:06:46.048
Mum, mum?!

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:56.358
Mum?

01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:03.767
It's all right, mum.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.033
Moving's hard, mum,

01:07:05.067 --> 01:07:08.505
but you don't have to
if you don't want to.

01:07:14.544 --> 01:07:18.113
What would you give
to have him back again?

01:07:18.147 --> 01:07:19.248
Properly back.

01:07:22.419 --> 01:07:25.822
Anything, mum, but
you know, he's gone.

01:07:38.367 --> 01:07:39.201
Yana.

01:07:49.412 --> 01:07:52.314
The hoodie's taking people.

01:07:52.347 --> 01:07:53.883
I'm just wondering how
possession works, that's all.

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:55.350
The ghost
steps out of their body

01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:57.352
and then it becomes a
vessel for another ghost.

01:07:57.387 --> 01:07:58.922
Has anyone besides
you taken it?

01:07:58.954 --> 01:08:01.256
You keep putting that crap into your
body, you'll turn into a shell.

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:02.991
another ghost.

01:08:03.025 --> 01:08:04.059
Unless she's working
for somebody else.

01:08:04.092 --> 01:08:07.062
I need to find a new man.

01:08:08.197 --> 01:08:10.365
Find a new man, a new man.

01:08:18.475 --> 01:08:19.274
You know,

01:08:20.975 --> 01:08:22.479
in certain lights,

01:08:23.613 --> 01:08:25.615
you could look like him.

01:08:30.653 --> 01:08:31.488
Henna?

01:08:34.156 --> 01:08:35.224
What are you?

01:08:38.728 --> 01:08:39.562
Mum!

01:08:46.268 --> 01:08:47.871
Your turn.

01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:52.374
Just give him a quarter.

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:53.408
It's strong.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.566
Officer Jayson Tagg
of the Aotearoa Police Service.

01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:22.639
Well, Yana, what about
your ankle bracelet?!

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:25.207
What happened to you, bro?

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.410
Marbles, he's in trouble.

01:09:27.443 --> 01:09:28.912
What do you mean?

01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:30.813
Well, his mum's gonna try
to put his dad inside him.

01:09:30.846 --> 01:09:31.981
Yeah, what do you mean?

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:34.216
We need to help him
but I can't get to him in time

01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:37.020
and his scooter's out of petrol.

01:09:38.654 --> 01:09:39.622
What about the keys?

01:09:39.656 --> 01:09:42.090
He left them in the ignition.

01:09:42.124 --> 01:09:43.593
Of course he bloody did.

01:09:43.626 --> 01:09:45.294
Let's roll.

01:10:02.045 --> 01:10:03.813
That's it.

01:10:03.846 --> 01:10:04.681
Good boy.

01:10:06.849 --> 01:10:07.784
Mum, how?

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.022
After you told me about it,

01:10:13.056 --> 01:10:14.222
I got curious.

01:10:15.692 --> 01:10:19.562
Your father's neurological
medication and marijuana,

01:10:19.596 --> 01:10:22.097
you sounded like a degenerate.

01:10:23.032 --> 01:10:24.867
And then there he was.

01:10:27.737 --> 01:10:28.571
Janine.

01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:32.374
Ross.

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:35.478
You held onto him.

01:10:39.048 --> 01:10:41.751
But then he kept
drifting away.

01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:46.456
It didn't take long.

01:10:46.489 --> 01:10:47.757
Isn't this lovely, darling?

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:49.025
His eyes clouded over

01:10:49.058 --> 01:10:50.827
and when he looked
at me, it was...

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.294
Darling?

01:10:52.327 --> 01:10:55.898
It
was as if he didn't see me.

01:10:55.932 --> 01:10:57.332
Ross?

01:10:57.366 --> 01:10:59.469
I wouldn't
lose him a second time.

01:11:02.472 --> 01:11:04.774
But then I figured it out.

01:11:10.079 --> 01:11:12.915
A little bit
of your drug opens up the mind.

01:11:12.949 --> 01:11:14.017
Ross, Ross?

01:11:15.952 --> 01:11:17.954
Turns out
a lot of it opens up the body.

01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:26.829
All I needed was a body.

01:11:28.731 --> 01:11:29.799
I'd find them

01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:34.937
and then my little helper
here would do the dirty work.

01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:36.105
Henna.

01:11:36.139 --> 01:11:37.807
It
wasn't always easy,

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.307
but you'd do anything for her,

01:11:39.341 --> 01:11:41.511
wouldn't you, Henna?

01:11:41.544 --> 01:11:42.645
Henna, why?

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:51.120
I remembered Henna from
the days at the hospital.

01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:53.423
One day, we ran into each other

01:11:53.456 --> 01:11:54.991
and I told her
there might be a way

01:11:55.024 --> 01:11:57.093
to bring her mother back.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.697
And so she helped me.

01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:03.066
It was a simple system.

01:12:03.099 --> 01:12:06.569
I found them, Henna
stalked them and did...

01:12:09.839 --> 01:12:11.074
The messy part.

01:12:20.183 --> 01:12:23.086
From there, I'd overdose them
on your little concoction

01:12:23.119 --> 01:12:25.955
and invite my
darling Ross inside.

01:12:29.392 --> 01:12:30.793
In you get, love.

01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:37.232
What do you think, love?

01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:38.534
I'm thinking this
one but I don't know.

01:12:38.568 --> 01:12:40.403
Do you think that's better?

01:12:40.436 --> 01:12:42.171
He was in there,

01:12:42.205 --> 01:12:45.208
but it seemed like something
was out of alignment.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.909
Compatibility issue.

01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:51.080
So I had to try again.

01:13:00.556 --> 01:13:02.158
And again.

01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.727
And I finally found a good fit

01:13:04.761 --> 01:13:06.429
in an arrogant police officer.

01:13:07.997 --> 01:13:11.434
So that's when I decided to
sell the farm and move away.

01:13:11.467 --> 01:13:13.903
But again, I was wrong,

01:13:13.936 --> 01:13:16.672
so I went out and got
drunk and scouted for more.

01:13:16.706 --> 01:13:17.940
But wait.

01:13:17.974 --> 01:13:19.374
Why gay men?

01:13:19.408 --> 01:13:21.978
Usually no kids,
often live alone.

01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:25.347
Plus, they tend to
be cleaner and cuter.

01:13:30.219 --> 01:13:33.790
Ross outgrew every
body I gave him.

01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:36.459
For some reason, they
just wouldn't fit

01:13:36.492 --> 01:13:38.861
until the solution came to me.

01:13:38.895 --> 01:13:40.863
Someone was following
me last night.

01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:44.700
- Marbles?
- Henna?

01:13:44.734 --> 01:13:45.802
What?

01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:48.171
Maybe genetics is the key.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:54.644
Careful.

01:13:56.279 --> 01:13:59.615
Want to keep this body
in good shape for mummy.

01:14:00.883 --> 01:14:02.451
Kia
ora, Mrs. Marbeck.

01:14:02.485 --> 01:14:03.719
Sorry to come unannounced.

01:14:03.753 --> 01:14:04.987
I'm looking for Marbles.

01:14:05.021 --> 01:14:06.455
- He's got my keys.
- Get rid of him.

01:14:06.489 --> 01:14:09.258
I went to your
house but no one was in there.

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:10.960
Are you in here?

01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:12.495
- Mate...
- Shut up.

01:14:12.528 --> 01:14:14.864
Is that you, Marbles?

01:14:14.897 --> 01:14:18.301
Wow, you got a beautiful
home by the way.

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:23.371
I'm here for Marbles.

01:14:23.406 --> 01:14:25.041
Okay, well, he's not here.

01:14:25.074 --> 01:14:27.109
Then
why is my car here?

01:14:28.044 --> 01:14:28.978
Fuck off.

01:14:33.216 --> 01:14:34.050
Fuck off!

01:14:39.222 --> 01:14:40.289
Ma, please.

01:14:42.425 --> 01:14:45.928
Wouldn't you want to
see your father again?

01:14:45.962 --> 01:14:46.963
He's gone.

01:14:49.332 --> 01:14:51.334
Are you gone, sweetie?

01:15:02.979 --> 01:15:03.880
Dad, dad?

01:15:06.182 --> 01:15:08.351
Here you go, Ross, baby.

01:15:09.352 --> 01:15:10.887
It's not ideal.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.155
It's our best shot.

01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:14.190
Go on, love.

01:15:16.292 --> 01:15:17.460
No.

01:15:17.493 --> 01:15:19.595
Is everything all right?

01:15:20.763 --> 01:15:22.932
What the hell are
you still doing here?

01:15:22.965 --> 01:15:24.400
I came around the back.

01:15:24.433 --> 01:15:26.068
I was worried that this one
was holding you hostage,

01:15:26.102 --> 01:15:27.270
Mrs. Marbeck,

01:15:27.303 --> 01:15:30.039
but now I don't know
what's going on.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:32.808
That is so kind
of you, sweetheart,

01:15:32.842 --> 01:15:36.979
but I'm afraid that it's a
bit of a tricky time for us.

01:15:37.013 --> 01:15:40.016
You see, Dane is
having an overdose.

01:15:41.584 --> 01:15:42.518
Oh, okay.

01:15:43.986 --> 01:15:48.691
But we are looking after him
and he is gonna be just fine.

01:15:49.425 --> 01:15:51.027
Xavier, run.

01:15:52.128 --> 01:15:52.962
Run.

01:15:55.665 --> 01:15:56.933
Marbles, run!

01:16:12.515 --> 01:16:15.918
Right, let's get back into it.

01:16:20.122 --> 01:16:21.190
Fuck.

01:17:02.665 --> 01:17:04.100
Why don't we just let him go?

01:17:04.133 --> 01:17:08.671
You could just bring my
mum back like you promised.

01:17:08.704 --> 01:17:09.705
Oh, Henna.

01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:14.076
Please?

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:16.380
My sweet little princess.

01:17:36.032 --> 01:17:37.600
Marbles, Marbles!

01:17:49.379 --> 01:17:50.713
Marbles.

01:17:50.746 --> 01:17:51.781
The pond!

01:17:51.814 --> 01:17:52.815
- You?
- You?

01:17:53.716 --> 01:17:54.917
Who are you?

01:17:57.286 --> 01:17:58.154
Yeah!

01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:02.725
Go find Marbles!

01:18:02.758 --> 01:18:03.659
I got this!

01:18:06.762 --> 01:18:08.664
Who the hell are you?

01:18:22.945 --> 01:18:24.548
Don't.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.648
This wasn't the plan.

01:18:25.681 --> 01:18:26.849
Oh, come on.

01:18:28.717 --> 01:18:29.885
You must know.

01:18:31.053 --> 01:18:33.622
I was never gonna
bring your mum back.

01:18:33.656 --> 01:18:35.791
You mean nothing to me.

01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:37.427
You're just useful.

01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:42.566
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:18:51.107 --> 01:18:51.941
Dad, no!

01:18:53.742 --> 01:18:54.844
Dad, it's me!

01:18:55.878 --> 01:18:58.448
Dad, Marbles, dad, dad, please!

01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:02.118
Dad, I'm so sorry.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.022
I'm so sorry I didn't
say goodbye Dad.

01:19:09.091 --> 01:19:09.925
Hey!

01:19:12.094 --> 01:19:13.295
Dane!

01:19:13.329 --> 01:19:14.697
You didn't pass over!

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:15.865
Yeah, I couldn't
leave you, mate!

01:19:15.898 --> 01:19:17.501
You know we're friends!

01:19:17.534 --> 01:19:18.367
Best friends?

01:19:18.401 --> 01:19:20.069
Yeah, best friends!

01:19:22.371 --> 01:19:23.172
Don't hurt him!

01:19:23.205 --> 01:19:24.340
Don't hurt him, Tagg!

01:19:24.373 --> 01:19:25.575
Are you kidding me?

01:19:25.609 --> 01:19:26.742
Look, he's not your
dad anymore, Marbles!

01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:28.878
Look at the state of him!

01:19:29.845 --> 01:19:31.680
You missed your chance, mate.

01:19:31.714 --> 01:19:33.749
Look, sometimes, you know,

01:19:33.782 --> 01:19:37.920
moving on doesn't look
like we think it should.

01:19:37.953 --> 01:19:39.655
Marbles!

01:19:39.688 --> 01:19:40.490
Yana?

01:19:40.524 --> 01:19:42.691
She's got me!

01:19:42.725 --> 01:19:45.227
I'm not gonna be quick
enough to save her.

01:19:45.261 --> 01:19:46.429
Help!

01:19:47.597 --> 01:19:49.331
Do you still want
to come inside me?

01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:50.534
Marbles, ow!

01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:53.903
Not so tough now, are you?

01:19:53.936 --> 01:19:57.306
Hey you, get
your damn hands off her!

01:19:57.339 --> 01:19:58.408
You heard me.

01:19:59.376 --> 01:20:00.709
I'm your mother!

01:20:00.743 --> 01:20:02.344
You can't tell me what to do.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:10.453
Tell him to give me his body.

01:20:11.854 --> 01:20:13.623
You're so gross.

01:20:13.657 --> 01:20:15.157
Mum, let her go!

01:20:17.693 --> 01:20:19.496
Yeah, that's right!

01:20:30.105 --> 01:20:31.675
Yeah, atta-boy, Marbles!

01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:33.742
Marbles, what have you done?

01:20:33.776 --> 01:20:37.447
Wow, this is,
this is pretty weird.

01:20:43.553 --> 01:20:44.387
Dad?

01:20:46.355 --> 01:20:47.923
Look at him, mum.

01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:50.226
Look at what he's become.

01:20:50.259 --> 01:20:51.160
Oh, Ross.

01:20:53.796 --> 01:20:55.831
You shouldn't
have held on to him.

01:20:55.864 --> 01:20:57.032
Oh, darling.

01:21:00.637 --> 01:21:01.971
Are you okay?

01:21:02.004 --> 01:21:04.507
Marbles, you're
really in there?

01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:06.275
Yeah.

01:21:06.308 --> 01:21:08.010
This is pretty buzzy.

01:21:09.613 --> 01:21:10.980
Ross?

01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:13.983
Oh, Ross, I have
missed you so much.

01:21:15.485 --> 01:21:18.787
We can be together
again, can't we?

01:21:18.821 --> 01:21:21.023
Ross, Ross, it's me.

01:21:21.056 --> 01:21:22.626
Darling, your love.

01:21:25.428 --> 01:21:26.262
Ross?

01:21:30.966 --> 01:21:31.800
You.

01:21:34.169 --> 01:21:35.271
You did this.

01:21:42.746 --> 01:21:45.014
Holy shit!

01:21:46.949 --> 01:21:47.783
Look.

01:21:51.253 --> 01:21:54.591
I just wanted to be
with the man I love.

01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:57.460
Was that so wrong?

01:21:58.861 --> 01:22:00.829
What about me, mum?

01:22:00.863 --> 01:22:03.433
I lost someone as well.

01:22:03.466 --> 01:22:07.771
Well, two people if you
consider what you've become.

01:22:10.839 --> 01:22:13.677
Look, we failed dad
when he was alive.

01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:15.578
Let's not fail him now.

01:22:18.548 --> 01:22:20.282
He's not here anymore.

01:22:23.952 --> 01:22:25.455
I'm sorry, Ross.

01:23:04.728 --> 01:23:05.628
Hey, sis.

01:23:10.767 --> 01:23:13.102
You know I love you
and shit, right?

01:23:26.115 --> 01:23:27.817
Hey, Marbles.

01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:29.184
Come here, mate.

01:23:39.194 --> 01:23:42.898
Hey, listen, Marbles,
about the life insurance.

01:23:42.931 --> 01:23:44.667
It's all right, Tagg.

01:23:44.701 --> 01:23:46.636
I don't need the life
insurance anymore.

01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:49.739
You can't have done all this
for nothing though, Marbles.

01:23:49.773 --> 01:23:53.342
I didn't do it
for nothing, Tagg.

01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:57.146
Hey, thanks for
letting me, you know.

01:23:57.179 --> 01:23:59.516
Oh, I liked it in the end.

01:24:04.621 --> 01:24:06.489
Well, hey, I,

01:24:06.523 --> 01:24:07.624
Marbles, I...

01:24:09.793 --> 01:24:10.627
I...

01:24:13.162 --> 01:24:13.996
You too.

01:24:14.963 --> 01:24:15.799
What?

01:24:16.965 --> 01:24:19.301
Oh, I thought you
were gonna say...

01:24:19.334 --> 01:24:20.169
What?

01:24:21.604 --> 01:24:25.675
I thought you were gonna
say that you loved me, but.

01:24:28.445 --> 01:24:31.113
Oh.

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:16.258
