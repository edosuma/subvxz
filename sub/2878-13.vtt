WEBVTT

00:00.495 --> 00:02.779
You feel like trying
something new for dinner?

00:02.780 --> 00:05.081
Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?

00:05.083 --> 00:07.217
You ever wonder how
humans would be different

00:07.219 --> 00:10.420
if they evolved from lizards
instead of mammals?

00:12.456 --> 00:14.674
Okay, let's talk
about that.

00:16.093 --> 00:18.812
As you know, lizards--
cold-blooded animals--

00:18.814 --> 00:20.897
lack the ability to
sense temperature.

00:20.899 --> 00:23.817
But they do move more
sluggishly when it's cold.

00:23.819 --> 00:26.486
So, lizard weathermen
would say things like,

00:26.488 --> 00:29.772
"Bring a sweater,
it's slow outside."

00:31.775 --> 00:34.861
I love my mind.

00:34.863 --> 00:36.412
We all do.

00:36.414 --> 00:37.813
Now, how about dinner?

00:37.815 --> 00:42.035
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy
insects or smaller lizards.

00:42.037 --> 00:44.037
We could also pull each other's
tails off and grill them;

00:44.039 --> 00:46.039
they'll just grow back.

00:48.759 --> 00:49.825
Oh!

00:49.827 --> 00:53.713
My life-size cardboard
Mr. Spock is here!

00:53.715 --> 00:57.350
I know he wouldn't care for
an outburst of human emotion,

00:57.352 --> 01:00.186
but, oh, goodie, oh,
goodie, oh, goodie.

01:01.505 --> 01:06.676
Commander Spock requesting
permission to be unfolded.

01:06.678 --> 01:07.677
Excuse me.

01:07.679 --> 01:10.179
Permission granted, Commander.

01:11.782 --> 01:14.367
Which is why the more
intelligent the monkey,

01:14.369 --> 01:16.986
the more feces they fling.

01:18.489 --> 01:20.456
(knocks)
Excuse me, Amy.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.492
Penny, do you have plans
for dinner tonight?

01:22.494 --> 01:23.859
Why, you guys going somewhere?

01:23.861 --> 01:24.994
No, I mean just you and me.

01:24.996 --> 01:28.248
You mean, like a date?

01:28.250 --> 01:30.166
Not like a date, a date.

01:30.168 --> 01:34.337
Ooh...!
Ooh...!

01:34.339 --> 01:38.341
Um... o-okay.

01:38.343 --> 01:39.342
Sure.

01:39.344 --> 01:42.979
Ooh...!
Ooh...!

01:42.981 --> 01:44.230
SHELDON:
Oh, no!

01:44.232 --> 01:47.283
They sent the wrong Spock!

01:48.402 --> 01:52.021
Live long and suck it,
Zachary Quinto.

01:52.022 --> 01:54.222
<font color=#00FF00>The Big Bang Theory 5x13</font>

Original Air Date on January 19, 2012

01:54.223 --> 01:56.223
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

01:56.264 --> 01:58.382
This is so exciting.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.050
If Leonard and Penny
get back together,

02:00.052 --> 02:02.269
Howard and I can go on
double dates with them.

02:02.271 --> 02:06.223
How come you never invite
Sheldon and me on a double date?

02:06.225 --> 02:09.559
Mm, uh...

02:09.561 --> 02:11.545
How's it going
in there, Penny?!

02:11.547 --> 02:13.547
PENNY:
Just a sec.

02:14.399 --> 02:17.401
Too much?

02:17.403 --> 02:19.569
Yes.
No.

02:21.139 --> 02:24.074
Okay, just hang on.

02:24.076 --> 02:27.878
You just can't handle
her raw sexuality, can you?

02:27.880 --> 02:30.997
When did you and Leonard
break up?

02:30.999 --> 02:32.766
Uh, about two years ago.

02:32.768 --> 02:35.051
Why do you think
he asked you out again?

02:35.053 --> 02:36.002
I don't know.

02:36.004 --> 02:37.237
Maybe he's dying.

02:37.239 --> 02:39.389
That would be so romantic.

02:39.391 --> 02:41.508
He's not dying.

02:41.510 --> 02:43.460
Too bad.

02:43.462 --> 02:45.962
If he were, she could just
throw him in bed

02:45.964 --> 02:49.116
and ride him
right up until he flatlines.

02:51.986 --> 02:54.654
How about this?

02:54.656 --> 02:57.674
Maybe.
Come on.

02:57.676 --> 03:00.527
Yeah, okay, no.

03:00.529 --> 03:02.662
Do you think
you'll sleep with him tonight?

03:02.664 --> 03:03.997
PENNY:
Absolutely not.

03:03.999 --> 03:05.332
Look, we're just
gonna have dinner

03:05.334 --> 03:07.117
and, you know,
see how it goes.

03:07.119 --> 03:09.369
If he were dying,
would you sleep with him?

03:09.371 --> 03:10.987
What?!

03:10.989 --> 03:12.622
Assuming he were
dying of something

03:12.624 --> 03:15.342
that couldn't be
sexually transmitted.

03:15.344 --> 03:18.795
You know, like a spear wound
to the head.

03:18.797 --> 03:20.430
Okay, he is not dying.

03:20.432 --> 03:23.099
How do you know?
Are you a doctor?

03:23.101 --> 03:25.318
You can make-believe, though.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.472
Sometimes Howard and I pretend
that his arrhythmia is acting up

03:28.474 --> 03:30.173
and I'm a sexy cardiologist.

03:30.175 --> 03:35.395
And the naughty part is
I'm not in his HMO network.

03:37.148 --> 03:40.066
Screw it. I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.

03:40.068 --> 03:41.568
It's just dinner.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.286
With a dead man.

03:43.288 --> 03:44.854
(growls playfully)

03:44.856 --> 03:46.823
Amy, stop it.

03:46.825 --> 03:48.208
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

03:48.210 --> 03:49.493
BERNADETTE:
Relax.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.578
You know Leonard's
always been crazy about you.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.796
It's gonna be great.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.414
I know, but we've finally
gotten to a place

03:54.416 --> 03:56.049
where we can hang out
without it being weird.

03:56.051 --> 03:58.051
And what if something
goes wrong? Then what?

03:58.053 --> 03:59.820
Guess it'll just
be Sheldon and me

03:59.822 --> 04:02.672
going on a double date
with Howard and Bernadette.

04:02.674 --> 04:06.393
Sure, we'd love that.

04:06.395 --> 04:10.096
Change your clothes;
we got a lot riding on this.

04:15.069 --> 04:17.070
Mm...

04:17.072 --> 04:19.623
I want to build a road,

04:19.625 --> 04:22.725
but I need wood.

04:22.727 --> 04:24.961
Do either of you fellows
have wood?

04:31.252 --> 04:33.470
I don't understand the laughter.

04:34.805 --> 04:36.239
The object of Settlers of Catan

04:36.241 --> 04:38.258
is to build roads
and settlements.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.709
To do so requires wood.

04:39.711 --> 04:43.230
Now, I have sheep; I need wood.

04:45.149 --> 04:47.267
Who has wood for my sheep?

04:47.269 --> 04:49.035
(both laughing)

04:50.254 --> 04:52.889
Okay, how do I look?

04:52.891 --> 04:55.559
More to the point, why
are you doing this?

04:55.561 --> 04:56.476
What are you talking about?

04:56.478 --> 04:57.944
Did you forget
what Penny did to you?

04:57.946 --> 05:00.196
It took you two years
and defiling my sister

05:00.198 --> 05:02.765
to turn that frown upside down.

05:02.767 --> 05:06.102
I didn't defile your sister,
we had a relationship.

05:06.104 --> 05:09.639
I heard you call her
Brown Sugar.

05:09.641 --> 05:12.475
In my book,
that's defilement.

05:12.477 --> 05:14.010
You want to know my opinion?

05:14.012 --> 05:16.446
Oh, boy, do I!

05:16.448 --> 05:18.615
Sarcasm?

05:18.617 --> 05:20.951
No.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.253
All right, then.

05:24.488 --> 05:25.955
The reason you're fixated on

05:25.957 --> 05:28.675
a good-natured simpleton
like Penny is that

05:28.677 --> 05:32.095
she's the exact opposite of
your first romantic attachment:

05:32.097 --> 05:34.064
your brilliant
yet intimidating mother.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.316
Where on earth
did you get that from?

05:36.318 --> 05:39.686
It's in her book,
<i>Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.</i>

05:41.522 --> 05:43.806
That doesn't make it true.

05:43.808 --> 05:46.526
It's called nonfiction
for a reason, Leonard.

05:46.528 --> 05:48.795
See you later.

05:49.664 --> 05:51.448
If they ever make
a movie version

05:51.450 --> 05:54.034
of that book, you know who
should play Leonard's mother?

05:54.036 --> 05:55.719
Sandra Bullock.

05:56.337 --> 05:57.587
Why?

05:57.589 --> 06:01.441
Because she's great
in everything.

06:03.994 --> 06:06.296
Now, where were we?

06:06.298 --> 06:08.465
Oh, yes.
Does anyone have any wood?

06:08.467 --> 06:09.516
(both snickering)

06:09.518 --> 06:10.833
Oh, come on!

06:10.835 --> 06:12.636
I just want wood.

06:12.638 --> 06:14.437
Why are you making it so hard?

06:14.439 --> 06:15.989
(both laughing)

06:23.013 --> 06:25.848
So, do they have a name
for a first date

06:25.850 --> 06:27.734
with someone
you used to go out with?

06:27.736 --> 06:29.819
Oh, that's a good question.

06:29.821 --> 06:31.354
How about "awkward"?

06:31.356 --> 06:34.374
Yeah, that sounds right.

06:34.376 --> 06:36.159
Yeah?

06:36.161 --> 06:39.913
Hey, how about if we pretend
we're actually on a first date?

06:39.915 --> 06:41.197
See how that goes.

06:41.199 --> 06:42.215
Okay.

06:42.217 --> 06:44.334
(clears throat)

06:44.336 --> 06:46.886
So, Polly,
tell me about yourself.

06:46.888 --> 06:47.921
(chuckles)

06:47.923 --> 06:48.922
It's Penny.

06:48.924 --> 06:50.873
Oh, sorry, yeah.
Awkward.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.209
(laughs)

06:53.211 --> 06:54.561
Okay, uh, let's see.

06:54.563 --> 06:57.814
I'm from Nebraska, and ever
since I was a little girl,

06:57.816 --> 07:00.400
I dreamed of moving to L.A.
and becoming a movie star.

07:00.402 --> 07:01.985
Anyway,

07:01.987 --> 07:04.771
after four years of acting
lessons and waiting tables,

07:04.773 --> 07:06.723
I've done
a hemorrhoid commercial

07:06.725 --> 07:09.409
and a production of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

07:09.411 --> 07:10.527
(chuckles)

07:10.529 --> 07:13.580
So, you know,
dreams do come true.

07:14.532 --> 07:15.498
Your turn.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.566
Uh, let's see.

07:16.568 --> 07:17.751
(clears throat)

07:17.753 --> 07:20.069
Uh, I am an experimental
physicist at Cal-Tech,

07:20.071 --> 07:23.339
most of my research is
with high-powered lasers,

07:23.341 --> 07:25.675
and, oh, I've just gotten
a big government grant

07:25.677 --> 07:28.011
to see if they can be used
to knock out

07:28.013 --> 07:29.129
incoming ballistic missiles.

07:29.131 --> 07:30.580
Wow. Can they?

07:30.582 --> 07:32.382
Oh, God, no.

07:35.919 --> 07:37.754
The money's pretty good.

07:38.939 --> 07:42.475
And I used the equipment
to make my own Bat-signal.

07:42.477 --> 07:43.610
(laughs)

07:43.612 --> 07:44.778
Bat-signal?

07:44.780 --> 07:46.229
What are you, some kind of nerd?

07:46.231 --> 07:49.983
Not some kind of nerd,
I'm the king of the nerds.

07:49.985 --> 07:51.451
(laughs)

07:53.821 --> 07:55.455
What does that mean?

07:55.457 --> 07:58.208
Uh, it means
if anyone displeases me,

07:58.210 --> 08:00.810
I don't help them
set up their printer.

08:00.812 --> 08:02.495
(laughs)

08:02.497 --> 08:03.997
You are so funny.

08:03.999 --> 08:05.215
Good.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.133
Remember that
when I take my shirt off.

08:07.135 --> 08:08.334
(both laugh)

08:10.171 --> 08:11.221
Leonard, this is nice.

08:11.223 --> 08:12.505
I'm so glad we did this.

08:12.507 --> 08:13.606
Me, too.

08:15.726 --> 08:16.793
So what do you think?

08:16.795 --> 08:18.061
Are we gonna get back together?

08:18.063 --> 08:20.680
Whoa. Not so fast.

08:20.682 --> 08:22.532
I'm sorry, what did I say?

08:22.534 --> 08:26.269
Leonard, you know I will always
have feelings for you.

08:26.271 --> 08:27.821
Oh, God.
What?

08:27.823 --> 08:29.239
You said "always."

08:29.241 --> 08:30.807
You'll always have
feelings for me.

08:30.809 --> 08:31.741
So?

08:31.743 --> 08:33.275
So, that sounds more like

08:33.278 --> 08:35.195
something you'd say
if you <i>didn't</i> want

08:35.197 --> 08:36.328
a relationship with someone.

08:36.331 --> 08:37.746
"This isn't working out,

08:37.749 --> 08:39.532
but I'll always have
feelings for you."

08:39.534 --> 08:41.417
"I'm sorry I slept
with your best friend,

08:41.419 --> 08:43.318
but I'll always have
feelings for you."

08:43.321 --> 08:44.788
"Here's the thing, Lisa,

08:44.790 --> 08:48.541
I'm into dudes now, but I'll
always have feelings for you."

08:48.543 --> 08:50.927
How would you say it?

08:50.929 --> 08:52.829
I have feelings for you.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.130
It's the same thing.
No, it's not.

08:54.132 --> 08:55.498
"Always" made it worse.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.499
You're overthinking this.

08:56.501 --> 08:57.717
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

08:57.719 --> 08:59.135
You always overthink things.

08:59.137 --> 09:00.854
Th-There you go.
"Always" made it worse.

09:02.623 --> 09:06.009
See, this is where everything
goes wrong: when we talk.

09:06.011 --> 09:10.780
Well, I don't know how you have
a relationship without talking.

09:10.782 --> 09:12.282
Hey, I went out with this guy TJ

09:12.284 --> 09:13.650
for eight months,
we never talked.

09:13.652 --> 09:15.869
To this day, I don't even know
what TJ stands for.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.521
Wait, if you guys
didn't talk, what--

09:18.523 --> 09:20.290
Never mind, stupid question.

09:23.544 --> 09:27.530
And now that I have
some wood,

09:27.532 --> 09:31.801
I'm going to begin
the erection of my settlement.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.421
He's got to be
doing this on purpose.

09:35.423 --> 09:36.973
(laughs)

09:38.893 --> 09:40.376
Ooh, 8:30.

09:40.378 --> 09:43.880
You and Penny decide to go out
and paint the town beige?

09:43.882 --> 09:47.049
You're 30 years old
and you live with your mother.

09:49.887 --> 09:51.888
I guess it didn't go well.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.423
We don't know that.

09:53.425 --> 09:54.574
Not to a certainty.

09:54.576 --> 09:57.327
All we know
is that Leonard is home.

09:57.329 --> 10:00.246
(Leonard screams)

10:00.248 --> 10:02.732
How about now?

10:02.734 --> 10:05.668
Again, not enough
evidence.

10:05.670 --> 10:08.705
For all we know,
he's being murdered.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.375
Now, back to our game.

10:12.377 --> 10:15.728
You were in the middle
of an erection.

10:18.866 --> 10:22.101
Oh, of course.
It's right here in my hand.

10:28.642 --> 10:30.860
(cell phone chimes)

10:32.763 --> 10:36.065
(grunting quietly)

10:36.067 --> 10:38.618
What does she want from me now?

10:41.705 --> 10:44.274
What's up?

10:44.276 --> 10:46.776
Do not overthink this.

10:54.051 --> 10:57.136
I don't understand.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

10:57.138 --> 10:59.505
Okay, but earlier
it seemed like...

10:59.507 --> 11:01.724
No talking.

11:03.177 --> 11:05.962
Even during? 'Cause
sometimes I have questions.

11:11.854 --> 11:14.753
(panting)

11:14.754 --> 11:18.106
Well, that was fun.

11:18.108 --> 11:20.892
Yeah, except for when I got
the foot cramp.

11:20.894 --> 11:22.593
You hung in there, though.

11:22.595 --> 11:25.396
There was a lot at stake.

11:25.398 --> 11:28.132
So what do you
want to do now?

11:28.134 --> 11:30.718
Well, I want to go get
my asthma inhaler,

11:30.720 --> 11:32.920
but it might ruin the moment.

11:32.922 --> 11:34.739
(grunts)

11:34.741 --> 11:37.742
Just, just
help me out here.

11:37.744 --> 11:40.411
How does a miserable date
end in sex?

11:40.413 --> 11:42.997
I don't know,
it's complicated.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.749
Well, I'm
a pretty smart guy,

11:44.751 --> 11:47.135
and right now my brain has
dibs on the blood supply,

11:47.137 --> 11:49.137
so give it a go.

11:49.139 --> 11:51.756
Okay, it's just,

11:51.758 --> 11:53.674
at the restaurant
when you said

11:53.676 --> 11:55.093
you wanted us to
be together again,

11:55.095 --> 11:59.914
it got very real very
fast and I panicked.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.149
Why?

12:01.151 --> 12:03.217
What are you
afraid of?

12:03.219 --> 12:04.936
Well, what if
we do go out

12:04.938 --> 12:07.522
and I do something stupid
and dump you again?

12:07.524 --> 12:08.823
What if I dump you?

12:08.825 --> 12:09.974
(scoffs)

12:13.245 --> 12:15.780
Come on, be serious.

12:15.782 --> 12:18.282
Well, how about
if we don't think

12:18.284 --> 12:20.251
about this
as a relationship?

12:20.253 --> 12:22.787
It could be more like
a new version of software.

12:22.789 --> 12:24.789
Penny and Leonard 2.0.

12:24.791 --> 12:27.308
We can test it internally,
shake out the bugs,

12:27.310 --> 12:29.110
and if we both feel
it's solid,

12:29.112 --> 12:31.796
then we'll roll it out
to the public.

12:31.798 --> 12:34.749
So we don't tell people
we're back together?

12:34.751 --> 12:35.716
Exactly.

12:35.718 --> 12:37.802
We pretend like our date
went badly.

12:37.804 --> 12:39.954
Well, we don't really
have to pretend.

12:39.956 --> 12:42.223
And we let them think
that we decided

12:42.225 --> 12:43.391
to just be friends

12:43.393 --> 12:45.309
and that everything's cool.

12:45.311 --> 12:46.844
Okay, great.

12:46.846 --> 12:47.845
(grunts softly)

12:47.847 --> 12:50.014
Hey, I just remembered.

12:50.016 --> 12:52.299
I still got one
of your inhalers.

12:54.403 --> 12:56.604
I can't believe
you kept this.

12:56.606 --> 12:59.273
Yeah, I was gonna throw it
away, but I just couldn't.

12:59.275 --> 13:01.859
That is so sweet.

13:01.861 --> 13:04.028
(sighs)

13:05.798 --> 13:08.132
In 25 to 30 minutes
I'm gonna show you

13:08.134 --> 13:10.735
how much
this means to me.

13:11.954 --> 13:15.206
(toilet flushes)

13:22.181 --> 13:22.830
Leonard?

13:22.832 --> 13:25.016
Yeah, hi, hi.

13:25.968 --> 13:27.935
How's it going?

13:27.937 --> 13:29.637
Uh, can't complain.

13:29.639 --> 13:31.606
Thanks for asking.

13:32.691 --> 13:35.810
Well, what were you doing out
at 3:00 in the morning?

13:35.812 --> 13:39.680
Well, uh, uh...
what are <i>you</i> doing up?

13:39.682 --> 13:42.283
I was using the bathroom.

13:42.285 --> 13:46.154
Yeah, well, so was I.

13:46.156 --> 13:48.289
Really?

13:48.291 --> 13:50.992
I didn't see you in there.

13:52.744 --> 13:56.914
Obviously... when I saw
that you were in ours,

13:56.916 --> 14:00.301
I went and used another one.

14:01.136 --> 14:04.005
Where?

14:04.007 --> 14:06.924
The, the gas station
across the street.

14:07.809 --> 14:09.877
In your pajamas?

14:09.879 --> 14:12.430
Yes.

14:12.432 --> 14:14.649
Without shoes?

14:15.901 --> 14:18.102
Yes.

14:18.887 --> 14:21.772
On a cold
winter's night?

14:23.609 --> 14:25.826
Yes.

14:28.614 --> 14:30.831
Seems unlikely.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.117
Did you bring
your asthma inhaler?

14:33.119 --> 14:36.504
Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.

14:39.741 --> 14:41.959
Well, then,
I guess it's plausible.

14:43.045 --> 14:45.129
D-- hang on a
second, mister.

14:45.131 --> 14:46.347
What?

14:46.349 --> 14:51.068
After you used the facilities
at the gas station,

14:51.070 --> 14:52.436
did you make a purchase?

14:52.438 --> 14:54.138
What?

14:54.140 --> 14:56.724
It's customary, when
using the restroom

14:56.726 --> 15:00.194
at a retail establishment,
to make a small purchase.

15:00.196 --> 15:01.279
Did you?

15:01.281 --> 15:02.730
No.

15:02.732 --> 15:04.098
(scoffs)

15:04.100 --> 15:06.284
Here's two dollars.

15:09.071 --> 15:11.956
Go buy some beef jerky.

15:18.213 --> 15:21.449
I don't want beef jerky.

15:23.652 --> 15:25.586
It's not about you.

15:25.588 --> 15:28.139
It's about a poor immigrant
from Pakistan

15:28.141 --> 15:29.957
trying to make his way
in America

15:29.959 --> 15:31.392
by working the graveyard shift

15:31.394 --> 15:34.061
at the Colorado Boulevard
Chevron.

15:35.964 --> 15:38.149
Fine.

15:40.269 --> 15:43.237
Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.

15:45.307 --> 15:46.907
Leonard will be here
in a moment.

15:46.909 --> 15:49.443
He's looking
for a different parking space.

15:49.445 --> 15:50.411
Why?

15:50.413 --> 15:51.779
We were next to a car

15:51.781 --> 15:54.365
with an "Ask me about my
grandchildren" bumper sticker,

15:54.367 --> 15:57.084
and I was afraid if we ran
into them on the way out,

15:57.086 --> 15:59.704
I'd be obligated
to do so.

16:00.989 --> 16:04.491
I'm so disappointed it didn't
work with him and Penny.

16:04.493 --> 16:06.160
Me, too.

16:06.162 --> 16:07.328
Out of deference
to them,

16:07.330 --> 16:10.798
let's not flaunt our
happy relationship.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.134
You have a keen insight
into the human heart,

16:13.136 --> 16:15.586
Amy Farrah Fowler.

16:16.805 --> 16:20.891
We are next to a Suburu with
a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.

16:20.893 --> 16:23.611
Well, I doubt they'd want to
talk about that, so we're fine.

16:25.113 --> 16:26.847
I'm surprised to see you here

16:26.849 --> 16:29.150
after it went
so badly with Penny.

16:29.152 --> 16:30.785
Well, hey, we're grown-ups.

16:30.787 --> 16:32.236
We can still be friends.

16:32.238 --> 16:34.538
Boy, I don't know if I
could be friends with Howie

16:34.540 --> 16:35.940
if we broke up.

16:35.942 --> 16:36.791
Why not?

16:36.793 --> 16:39.610
I'm a very vengeful person.

16:39.612 --> 16:42.079
Really?

16:42.081 --> 16:45.166
With access
to weaponized smallpox.

16:47.219 --> 16:49.170
Here you go, guys, let me get
you going with some water.

16:49.172 --> 16:50.755
You need menus
or you know what you want?

16:50.757 --> 16:52.206
Leonard knows what he wants,
but it looks

16:52.208 --> 16:54.158
like he's not gonna
get it from you.

16:55.210 --> 16:56.710
Howard.
No,

16:56.712 --> 16:58.095
that's okay, Bernadette.

16:58.097 --> 17:00.348
Sometimes these things
just don't work out.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.816
Yeah, it's all good.

17:01.818 --> 17:04.769
We-We'll always have
feelings for each other.

17:06.387 --> 17:09.223
Oh, that's nice.

17:09.224 --> 17:12.393
See, she knew
what "always" meant.

17:12.395 --> 17:15.195
Wow, you're like a dog
with a bone, aren't you?

17:15.198 --> 17:17.415
I'm just making a point.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.900
Is the point that you don't know
when to let something go?

17:19.902 --> 17:20.751
People, people,

17:20.752 --> 17:22.252
please,
before you say

17:22.255 --> 17:23.838
something you
both regret,

17:23.839 --> 17:25.673
I'd like to place my order.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.459
Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon.

17:28.461 --> 17:29.960
You know why we can't be
together?

17:29.962 --> 17:31.412
Because you always have
to be right.

17:31.414 --> 17:32.913
Oh, that is not true.

17:32.915 --> 17:34.181
I got to go
with Leonard on this.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.684
He is wrong
more than anyone I know.

17:37.652 --> 17:39.353
You know what?
I just realized I'm on a break.

17:39.355 --> 17:40.604
I'll get someone else.

17:40.606 --> 17:42.423
Well...

17:42.425 --> 17:45.142
Leonard, promise me that when
our new waitress comes over,

17:45.144 --> 17:48.145
you will not start a complicated
on-again, off-again relationship

17:48.147 --> 17:50.898
with her,
because I am very, very hungry.

17:53.351 --> 17:56.404
(grunting quietly)

17:56.406 --> 17:58.605
(phone chimes)

18:02.461 --> 18:04.662
Unbelievable.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.301
Mind explaining to me
why you were being

18:10.303 --> 18:11.836
such a jerk at the restaurant?
Well,

18:11.838 --> 18:13.721
I was trying to act like
we weren't seeing each other.

18:13.723 --> 18:15.122
That was the plan, right?
No,

18:15.124 --> 18:17.458
the plan was to tell people
we decided to stay friends.

18:17.460 --> 18:18.625
That's a little hard to do

18:18.627 --> 18:22.179
when you're always being
such a tool bag.

18:22.181 --> 18:24.982
You know what? I don't have to
stand here and take this crap.

18:24.984 --> 18:26.851
The hell do you think
you're going?

18:26.853 --> 18:30.020
Isn't sex after fighting
kind of what we do now?!

18:30.022 --> 18:32.523
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

18:40.615 --> 18:42.583
What are we doing?

18:42.585 --> 18:43.784
What do you mean?

18:43.786 --> 18:47.505
Every scenario I play out
for you and me ends badly.

18:47.507 --> 18:49.890
That's because you
overthink everything.

18:49.892 --> 18:52.159
SHELDON: <i>Leonard, are you listening</i>
<i>to me?</i>

18:52.161 --> 18:53.594
What?
Yeah.

18:53.596 --> 18:55.596
This is a disaster.

18:55.598 --> 18:56.847
I distinctly ordered

18:56.849 --> 18:59.300
the Leonard Nimoy Mr.
Spock cardboard standee.

18:59.302 --> 19:00.851
Why would
I feel safer

19:00.853 --> 19:03.721
with Zachary Quinto
at the foot of my bed?

19:04.856 --> 19:09.109
I don't know, he was
pretty badass on <i>Heroes.</i>

19:09.111 --> 19:12.346
You're right, I'll
give him a shot.

19:14.316 --> 19:16.200
Hang on.

19:16.202 --> 19:17.868
Penny, do you have
plans for dinner?

19:17.870 --> 19:19.487
Why, you guys going somewhere?

19:19.489 --> 19:20.404
No, I mean just you and me.

19:20.406 --> 19:24.208
Ooh...!
Ooh...!

19:24.210 --> 19:26.710
Uh, have you thought
this through?

19:26.712 --> 19:30.247
Yes, and I think
we should go anyway.

19:32.968 --> 19:33.884
No, can't do it.

19:33.886 --> 19:35.753
Sorry, Quinto,
you're going back.

19:37.000 --> 19:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here

19:45.048 --> 19:46.831
If you and Leonard
get back together,

19:46.833 --> 19:48.333
Sheldon and I
will finally have someone

19:48.335 --> 19:50.018
to go on double dates with.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.336
What about me and Howard?

19:51.338 --> 19:53.772
Fine, we can double
with you, too.

19:54.657 --> 19:56.975
So insecure.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.865
Where are you guys going to eat?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.684
Penny?

20:05.037 --> 20:10.207
Do you, Penny, take Leonard to
be your lawful wedded husband?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.266
Well, it's
a little late for me

20:19.268 --> 20:21.552
to start saying no,
isn't it?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.056
Penny.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.173
Sorry,
just remembered

20:26.175 --> 20:28.025
I've got to stop
at the drugstore.
