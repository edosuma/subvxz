WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:06.367
>> REMIND ME. WHY AM I DOING

00:06.370 --> 00:07.530
THIS AGAIN?

00:07.540 --> 00:10.703
>> BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME. BECAUSE

00:10.710 --> 00:14.476
IT'S MY FANTASY. AND BECAUSE MY

00:14.480 --> 00:16.243
MONIQUE LHUILLIER DRESS IS A

00:18.380 --> 00:19.711
TO FEEL LIKE THE PERFECT BRIDE

00:19.720 --> 00:24.510
UNLESS I FIT INTO IT.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.387
>> THE THINGS YOU DO FOR LOVE.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.657
HIT IT.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.651
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04.690 --> 01:06.555
>> WILL THE BRUISING BE BAD?

01:06.560 --> 01:08.699
>> WITH MICRO LIPO, THERE IS NO

01:08.700 --> 01:10.565
BRUISING. IT SHOULD HEAL IN A

01:10.570 --> 01:12.367
DAY OR SO. IN FACT, YOU WILL BE

01:12.370 --> 01:13.359
FEELING SO GOOD THAT WE COULD

01:13.370 --> 01:15.235
DUCK OUT FOR A QUICK LUNCH.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.366
>> NO TIME FOR LUNCH,

01:16.370 --> 01:17.667
CHRISTIAN. I GOT TO MEET WITH

01:17.670 --> 01:19.376
THE WEDDING PLANNER.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.905
>> DO YOU THINK THESE WEDDING

01:21.910 --> 01:23.377
JI'I'I'ERS ARE MAKING YOU A LITTLE

01:23.380 --> 01:24.699
FORGETFUL, SWEETHEART? YOU

01:24.710 --> 01:25.904
HAVEN'T SIGNED YOUR FIDELITY

01:25.910 --> 01:26.911
PRE-NUP.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.512
>> OK. I'M GOING TO DO IT. I

01:28.520 --> 01:29.646
KNOW, I'M THE ONE WHO WANTED

01:29.650 --> 01:32.414
IT. IT'S JUST THAT I HAVEN'T

01:32.420 --> 01:36.379
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THE

01:36.390 --> 01:37.823
>> WHY ARE YOU FASTING?

01:37.830 --> 01:40.196
>> BECAUSE MY DRESS SHOWS EVERY

01:40.200 --> 01:41.189
>> WHICH I AM REMOVING AS WE

01:41.200 --> 01:42.189
SPEAK.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.269
>> I KNOW. BUT AT THIS POINT, I

01:43.270 --> 01:45.465
WILL GAIN WEIGHT IF I EVEN

01:45.470 --> 01:46.459
LOOK AT CAKE.

01:46.470 --> 01:48.597
>> WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING

01:48.600 --> 01:49.601
A WEDDING IF WE CAN'T ENJOY

01:49.610 --> 01:51.259
THIS KIND OF STUFF TOGETHER?

01:51.270 --> 01:52.635
>> IF I GAIN ANY OF THIS

01:52.640 --> 01:54.608
WEIGHT BACK, NOBODY'S GOING TO

01:54.610 --> 01:56.475
BE HAVING FUN BECAUSE I'M NOT

01:56.480 --> 01:57.845
GONNA BE THERE.

01:57.850 --> 02:03.288
>> FINE. I'LL DO THE TASTING.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.214
BUT JUST KEEP IN MIND IF YOU

02:06.220 --> 02:07.710
DON'T SIGN THAT PRE-NUP AND

02:07.720 --> 02:09.278
AGREE IN WRITING TO STOP

02:09.290 --> 02:10.188
DIRECT ING DOUBLE ENTRY

02:10.190 --> 02:13.227
GANG-BANGS, THERE WON'T EVEN BE

02:13.230 --> 02:14.549
A WEDDING.

03:03.010 --> 03:03.942
>> TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE

03:03.950 --> 03:05.645
ABOUT YOURSELF, MS. BERG.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.538
>> I'M HER MOTHER, MIRIAM BERG.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.017
AND I WAS JUST TELLING MADISON

03:09.020 --> 03:11.238
WHEN I TURNED 16, MY PARENTS

03:11.250 --> 03:12.649
JUST ANNOUNCED, "IF YOU WANT TO

03:12.660 --> 03:13.957
GET A HUSBAND, YOU GOING TO HAVE

03:13.960 --> 03:15.416
TO GET YOUR NOSE DONE."

03:15.420 --> 03:16.887
>> MY PARENTS BIG JOKE IS THAT

03:16.890 --> 03:18.323
I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY IF IT

03:18.330 --> 03:19.490
WEREN'T FOR THAT NOSE JOB.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.718
>> WE KNOW THAT YOUR MOM AND

03:21.730 --> 03:23.493
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU. DO YOU

03:23.500 --> 03:24.967
WANT A RHINOPLASTY?

03:24.970 --> 03:27.894
>> WELL, GETI'ING MARRIED AND

03:29.870 --> 03:30.905
LIST OF PRIORITIES. I MEAN, IT

03:30.910 --> 03:32.730
WAS FOR MY MOM BECAUSE THINGS

03:32.740 --> 03:33.775
WERE DIFFERENT THEN.

03:33.780 --> 03:34.769
>> WELL, NOT ALL THAT

03:34.780 --> 03:35.769
DIFFERENT. IT WASN'T LIKE IT

03:35.780 --> 03:36.906
WAS THE DARK AGES FOR GOD'S

03:36.910 --> 03:37.899
SAKE.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.377
>> ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR

03:39.380 --> 03:40.916
NOSE, MS. BERG?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.411
>> ALL I KNOW IS IT'S ALWAYS

03:43.420 --> 03:44.512
BEEN A GIVEN THAT I'D BE

03:44.520 --> 03:45.646
SITTING HERE A FEW DAYS BEFORE

03:45.650 --> 03:46.787
MY 16TH BIRTHDAY.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.018
>> IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL WHEN

03:48.020 --> 03:49.783
YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR. IT'S

03:49.790 --> 03:50.779
TRUE THAT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

03:50.790 --> 03:52.519
RHINOPLASTIES ON JEWISH GIRLS,

03:52.530 --> 03:53.997
AND THE TREND IS DEFINITELY

03:54.000 --> 03:57.367
TOWARDS A MORE REFINED PROFILE.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.065
WE CAN SHOW YOU SOME OF OUR

03:59.070 --> 04:00.765
WORK IF IT HELPS.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.931
>> I ASSUME YOU WANT TO TAKE

04:02.940 --> 04:04.407
ADVANTAGE OF OUR SWEET 16

04:04.410 --> 04:04.933
PACKAGE.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.500
>> ABSOLUTELY. WHEN I READ YOUR

04:07.510 --> 04:08.909
AD IN THE TEMPLE NEWSLETTER, IT

04:08.910 --> 04:10.343
SAID THAT YOU OFFERED A 20%

04:10.350 --> 04:11.806
DISCOUNT ON A RECOVERY ROOM AT

04:11.810 --> 04:13.368
THE DE LA MER SPA.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.677
>> OH, MY GOD, IT'S LISA

04:14.680 --> 04:16.682
BURROWS. SHE'S A SENIOR AT MY

04:16.690 --> 04:17.748
SCHOOL.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.889
>> HAVE YOU SEEN HER BEFORE

04:19.890 --> 04:21.687
PICTURE?

04:21.690 --> 04:29.324
>> LISA BURROWS IS JEWISH? OK.

04:29.330 --> 04:33.767
I'M IN. AND I WANT HER NOSE.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.778
>> DOES EVERYONE AT THIS SCHOOL

04:47.780 --> 04:50.988
SHOP AT J. CREW? YOU'RE THE

04:50.990 --> 04:53.584
ONLY WEIRDO I HAVE SEEN SO FAR.

04:53.590 --> 04:57.651
IT WAS A COMPLIMENT, BY THE WAY.

04:57.660 --> 05:01.027
>> IT WAS? WELL, THANK YOU THEN.

05:01.030 --> 05:05.626
>> I'M ARIEL. I'M IN YOUR

05:05.630 --> 05:08.633
AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. I'M NEW

05:08.640 --> 05:10.801
AT THIS SCHOOL.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.836
>> I'M MATT, THE WEIRDO IN THE

05:13.840 --> 05:15.808
BACK ROW.

05:15.810 --> 05:16.902
>> HI.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.741
>> HI.

05:18.750 --> 05:23.881
>> UH-OH. JAP, 3:00.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.921
>> OH, YEAH. SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE

05:31.930 --> 05:32.828
JUST GOT RELEASED FROM THE

05:32.830 --> 05:35.025
SLAUGHTERHOUSE MY DAD RUNS.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.793
HE'S A PLASTIC SURGEON. HE DOES

05:36.800 --> 05:38.995
A LOT OF SWEET 16 NOSE JOBS.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.560
>> JEWS WITH GENTILE NOSES AND

05:41.570 --> 05:43.561
GENTILE NAMES. IT'S COMPLETELY

05:43.570 --> 05:46.437
PATHETIC. THE BANDAGE ON HER

05:46.440 --> 05:47.475
FACE ISN'T COVERING HER NOSE

05:47.480 --> 05:48.708
JOB. IT'S BROADCASTING HER

05:48.710 --> 05:50.541
SELF-HATE. AND SHE'S NOT THE

05:50.550 --> 05:52.848
ONLY ONE. I MEAN, EVERYWHERE I

05:52.850 --> 05:53.817
LOOK, IT'S JUST A SEA OF

05:53.820 --> 05:55.173
PATHETIC LOOK-ALIKES AND

05:55.180 --> 05:56.647
WAN NABES.

05:56.650 --> 06:00.518
>> WELL, I'M SO NOT LIKE ANYONE

06:00.520 --> 06:01.851
ELSE HERE, I HARDLY EVEN NOTICE

06:01.860 --> 06:03.885
THEM, YOU KNOW?

06:03.890 --> 06:05.653
>> I LIKE THAT.

06:11.530 --> 06:13.532
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD REALLY

06:13.540 --> 06:15.189
HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.531
I'M DOING A TERM PAPER

06:16.540 --> 06:17.905
ON HOMOGENIZING INFLUENCES

06:17.910 --> 06:19.036
IN THE MELTING POT CULTURE.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.803
AND, UH, IT WOULD BE COOL

06:20.810 --> 06:22.175
TO TALK TO A PLASTIC SURGEON.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.171
MAYBE YOU COULD INTRODUCE ME

06:24.180 --> 06:25.477
TO YOUR DAD?

06:25.480 --> 06:29.917
>> [LAUGHS] UH...UM...

06:36.990 --> 06:39.151
>> IF IT WILL GET YOU TO HAVE

06:39.160 --> 06:41.549
COFFEE WITH ME, I WILL.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.563
>> YOU HAD ME AT "MATT, THE

06:44.570 --> 06:45.798
WEIRDO."

06:50.640 --> 06:51.607
>> I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO

06:51.610 --> 06:52.599
YOU. I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD BE

06:52.610 --> 06:53.235
DONE.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.673
>> I GIVE FULL CREDIT TO

06:54.680 --> 06:56.898
CHRISTIAN. HE JUST OPENED UP

06:56.910 --> 06:58.138
HIS HEART AND ALLOWED HIMSELF

06:58.150 --> 07:03.042
TO FEEL THE LOVE.

07:03.050 --> 07:05.814
>> MM, YOU'RE NICE AND LIMBER.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.253
IT MUST BE FROM ALL THOSE KINKY

07:07.260 --> 07:08.215
POSITIONS YOU HAVE TO DO FOR

07:08.220 --> 07:10.120
THE CUM SHOT.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.725
>> ACTUALLY, I PUT THE BLAME ON

07:13.730 --> 07:14.754
BRADLEY. HE'S OUR PRIVATE

07:14.760 --> 07:16.250
PILATES TRAINER. HE WORKS ME

07:16.260 --> 07:20.731
AND CHRISTIAN OUT EVERY MORNING.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.662
>> OH, THIS IS ON THE HOUSE.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.137
I VOLUNTEERED TO BE YOUR

07:24.140 --> 07:25.869
TECHNICIAN. THINK OF IT AS PART

07:25.870 --> 07:27.735
OF YOUR WEDDING GIFT. OH, AND

07:27.740 --> 07:29.742
BY THE WAY, I HAVEN'T RSVPed TO

07:29.750 --> 07:30.774
YOUR WEDDING INVITATION

07:30.780 --> 07:31.974
BECAUSE I GUESS THERE WAS SOME

07:31.980 --> 07:33.174
KIND OF MIX-UP.

07:33.180 --> 07:34.147
>> YOU WON'T BE RECEIVING AN

07:34.150 --> 07:36.948
INVITATION, GINA.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.611
[GASPS]

07:38.620 --> 07:39.882
>> I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT ONE.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.858
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME PUSSY

07:41.860 --> 07:49.562
BURN. SO, I'M NOT INVITED TO

07:49.570 --> 07:50.161
THE WEDDING.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.762
>> PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES,

07:51.770 --> 07:53.067
GINA. WE SIMPLY CAN'T

07:53.070 --> 07:54.059
ACCOMMODATE ALL OF CHRISTIAN'S

07:54.070 --> 07:55.731
EX- LOVERS.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.937
>> I NEED YOU ON ALL FOURS. AND

07:58.940 --> 07:59.929
I GUESS WITH ALL THOSE

07:59.940 --> 08:01.908
SCUMBAGS, PIMPS, AND PORN STARS

08:01.910 --> 08:03.969
YOU'VE BALLED, WELL, THAT WOULD

08:03.980 --> 08:07.279
WOULDN'T IT? OH, DID YOU WANT

08:07.280 --> 08:08.315
ME TO GET THE FOUR LONG DARK

08:08.320 --> 08:09.787
HAIRS UP YOUR ASS?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.917
>> I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT BE A

08:11.920 --> 08:13.615
LADY ABOUT THIS, GINA.

08:13.620 --> 08:14.655
>> YOU'RE NO LADY, AND NEITHER

08:14.660 --> 08:16.628
AM I. YOU'RE JUST THE LUCKY

08:16.630 --> 08:17.688
WHORE WHO WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE

08:17.690 --> 08:22.798
AT THE RIGHT TIME. HERE. PUT

08:22.800 --> 08:26.167
THIS ON YOUR ASS. THE TRUTH IS I

08:26.170 --> 08:27.262
WOULDN'T MARRY HIM NOW EVEN IF

08:27.270 --> 08:29.135
HE BEGGED ME. DID HE TELL YOU

08:29.140 --> 08:30.061
THAT HE STOPPED PAYING FOR MY

08:30.070 --> 08:31.332
AIDS COCKTAIL?

08:31.340 --> 08:32.830
>> A WAY TO A MAN'S HEART IS NOT

08:32.840 --> 08:34.205
ENTRAPPING HIM WITH YOUR

08:34.210 --> 08:35.199
TRAGEDY.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.575
>> YOU'RE THE TRAGEDY IF YOU

08:36.580 --> 08:38.172
MARRY HIM, KIMBER. CHRISTIAN

08:38.180 --> 08:39.204
TROY WILL NEVER LOVE ANYONE

08:39.210 --> 08:41.212
BUT THE ONE HE CAN'T HAVE, HIS

08:41.220 --> 08:43.017
PRECIOUS JULIA.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.017
>> HELLO, KIMBER. HOW IS THE

08:47.020 --> 08:51.354
WAXING? AM I INTERRUPTING

08:51.360 --> 08:52.691
SOMETHING?

08:52.700 --> 09:00.232
>> NO. WE'RE DONE.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.832
>> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD

09:01.840 --> 09:03.034
FILL IN A CUSTOMER

09:03.040 --> 09:04.701
SATISFACTION FORM.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.769
>> SURE.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.839
>> AND PLEASE BE HONEST. WE'RE

09:08.840 --> 09:11.104
NEW, SO WE WELCOME ANY AND ALL

09:11.110 --> 09:14.113
CRITICISM.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.715
>> ACTUALLY, I'D LIKE YOU TO BE

09:17.720 --> 09:19.608
HONEST WITH ME, JULIA.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.053
>> IS THERE SOMETHING YOU

09:21.060 --> 09:22.755
WANTED TO ASK ME?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.022
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU AND CHRISTIAN

09:24.030 --> 09:25.156
GIVE IT A TRY?

09:25.160 --> 09:29.153
>> OH. WHOO. UM...

09:36.740 --> 09:39.868
HONESTLY, THERE WAS ONCE

09:39.880 --> 09:42.940
AN ATTRACTION BETWEEN US.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.042
AND WE'RE STILL

09:44.050 --> 09:46.939
VERY GOOD AND VERY OLD FRIENDS.

09:46.950 --> 09:48.417
BUT CHRISTIAN AND I AREN'T IN

09:48.420 --> 09:52.959
LOVE. YOU AND CHRISTIAN ARE.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.698
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE COME A LONG

09:59.700 --> 10:01.019
WAY SINCE I FIRST FELL FOR THAT

10:01.030 --> 10:03.294
LAME PICKUP LINE THAT HE USED

10:03.300 --> 10:04.995
WHILE TROLLING FOR PATIENTS IN

10:05.000 --> 10:08.891
BARS. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

10:08.900 --> 10:16.671
I LOVE HIM. BUT I DON'T WANNA

10:16.680 --> 10:18.079
GIVE UP EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE

10:18.080 --> 10:21.379
WORKED SO HARD FOR JUST TO WAKE

10:21.380 --> 10:23.314
UP ONE DAY TO DISCOVER THAT THE

10:23.320 --> 10:24.719
TWO OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MISSED

10:24.720 --> 10:26.984
OUT. AND THAT YOU STILL NEED TO

10:26.990 --> 10:28.787
GIVE IT A TRY.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.258
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT

10:31.260 --> 10:36.459
A TRY. IT'S ALL IN THE PAST.

10:36.460 --> 10:39.429
>> THANK YOU. I NEEDED TO HEAR

10:39.430 --> 10:47.804
THAT. YOU KNOW, FOR WHAT IT'S

10:47.810 --> 10:49.971
WORTH, JULIA, YOU AND SEAN HAVE

10:49.980 --> 10:52.175
GOT TO BE TWO OF THE CLASSIEST

10:52.180 --> 10:54.944
PEOPLE I KNOW. AND I TOLD

FRIENDSHIP DOWN THE ROAD, HMM?

31:51.570 --> 31:52.969
FORGIVE ME. I GOT AHEAD OF

31:52.970 --> 31:56.474
MYSELF.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.435
HERE.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.146
>> OH. THANK YOU.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.071
>> SURE.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.445
>> "WHAT AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY

32:01.450 --> 32:04.283
IT'S BEEN, WATCHING YOU GROW

32:04.290 --> 32:05.518
FROM THAT PRETTY BUT SLIGHTLY

32:05.520 --> 32:07.738
SHALLOW GIRL TO A DEEP,

32:07.750 --> 32:10.253
BEAUTIFUL, POWERFUL WOMAN.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.659
YOU INSPIRE ME EVERY DAY WITH

32:11.660 --> 32:13.651
YOUR DIGNITY, KIMBER.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.218
YOUR CAPACITY FOR UNCONDITIONAL

32:15.230 --> 32:16.549
LOVE, YOUR PATIENCE--"

32:16.560 --> 32:18.164
WHY WOULD SHE FLY OFF THE HANDLE

32:18.170 --> 32:19.125
>> IT'S TEMPORARY, CHRISTIAN.

32:19.130 --> 32:20.620
BRIDES CAN BE IRRATIONAL.

32:20.630 --> 32:22.689
SO, ABOUT YOUR VOWS.

32:22.700 --> 32:23.689
YOU MIGHT LEAVE OUT THE PART

32:23.700 --> 32:25.008
WHERE YOU CALL HER A "SLIGHTLY

32:25.010 --> 32:27.604
SHALLOW GIRL."

32:27.610 --> 32:28.634
>> RIGHT.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.436
>> YEAH.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.078
>> GOT A PEN?

32:33.550 --> 32:37.316
>> HEY! SORRY I'M LATE.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.685
I HAD TO PICK UP MY TUX AT

32:38.690 --> 32:40.317
THE RENTAL PLACE.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.389
>> WHY WOULD YOU WAIT UNTIL

32:41.390 --> 32:43.358
AN HOUR BEFORE THE CEREMONY?

32:43.360 --> 32:44.486
>> I WANT TO BE HERE FOR YOU,

32:44.490 --> 32:45.627
CHRISTIAN, BUT IT'S KIND OF

32:45.630 --> 32:47.029
HARD WHEN YOU'RE ALL BENT OUT

32:47.030 --> 32:48.190
OF SHAPE AND SUPERIOR.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.656
>> NO, NO, NO. WHAT'S KIND OF

32:49.660 --> 32:52.493
HARD IS WHEN YOUR SON/ BEST MAN

32:52.500 --> 32:53.296
SHOWS UP AT YOUR WEDDING

32:53.300 --> 32:54.790
IN STORM TROOPER BOOTS

32:54.800 --> 32:55.732
AND SKINHEAD JEWELRY.

32:55.740 --> 32:56.695
WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH A LITTLE

32:56.700 --> 32:57.439
SHIT?

32:57.440 --> 33:00.329
>> ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN, CALM

33:00.340 --> 33:02.570
AND HE CAN TAKE OFF HIS EARRING.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.400
IS THAT A FAIR COMPROMISE?

33:10.820 --> 33:12.082
>> WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO

33:12.090 --> 33:16.459
COMPROMISE? THIS IS WHO I AM.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.451
WHY ISN'T IT GOOD ENOUGH?

33:18.460 --> 33:19.586
>> WHEN IT'S YOUR WEDDING, YOU

33:19.590 --> 33:20.579
CAN DRESS IN DRAG FOR ALL I

33:20.590 --> 33:23.229
CARE, BUT TODAY IS MY DAY

33:23.230 --> 33:27.189
AND I CALL THE SHOTS.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.235
>> SO I GUESS I'M NOT GOOD

33:28.240 --> 33:29.468
ENOUGH TO BE IN YOUR WEDDING.

33:29.470 --> 33:30.494
>> DRESSED UP LIKE A GODDAMN

33:30.500 --> 33:31.637
JERRY SPRINGER GUEST? YOU

33:31.640 --> 33:32.402
BETCHA.

33:32.410 --> 33:33.729
>> COME ON, CHRISTIAN.

33:33.740 --> 33:37.073
>> NO, IT'S OK.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.547
ACTUALLY, IT'S A RELIEF TO BE

33:38.550 --> 33:39.471
KICKED OUT OF YOUR WEDDING.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.549
STANDING UP FOR A

33:40.550 --> 33:42.211
SELF-IMPORTANT, HYPOCRITICAL

33:42.220 --> 33:43.414
ASSHOLE SUCH AS YOURSELF

33:43.420 --> 33:56.697
IS THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD

33:56.700 --> 33:58.622
>> IT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU TO BE

33:58.630 --> 33:59.767
SO GOOD ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

33:59.770 --> 34:01.635
>> IT'S ALL GOOD, JULIA.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.436
I DON'T WANT TO BE AT

34:02.440 --> 34:04.101
CHRISTIAN'S WEDDING, ESPECIALLY

34:04.110 --> 34:06.237
AS I WASN'T INVITED.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.537
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR

34:07.540 --> 34:11.374
COMING.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.109
>> ENJOY YOURSELF, AND CALL ME

34:13.110 --> 34:13.701
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

34:13.710 --> 34:14.870
WE CAN HAVE OUR OWN POST-WEDDING

34:14.880 --> 34:16.541
PARTY.

34:34.170 --> 34:38.231
>> WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.662
WE'RE BOTH WEARING WHITE.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.331
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,

34:41.340 --> 34:42.898
HOPING I'D GET COLD FEET SO YOU

34:44.380 --> 34:45.540
>> I JUST HAD TO DROP OFF A

34:45.550 --> 34:51.147
LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THE BRIDE.

34:51.150 --> 34:52.412
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME IF YOU

34:52.420 --> 34:55.309
OPENED IT NOW.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.514
PICKING OUT THE PERFECT WEDDING

34:56.520 --> 34:58.488
GIFT WAS NO EASY FEAT, KIMMY.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.549
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, SHE'S GOT

35:00.560 --> 35:02.425
SOMETHING NEW--HER TITS;

35:02.430 --> 35:03.692
THE GROOM IS BORROWED, SINCE

35:03.700 --> 35:04.826
SOONER OR LATER, HE'LL RETURN TO

35:04.830 --> 35:06.468
THE WOMEN OF GREATER MIAMI-DADE;

35:06.470 --> 35:07.528
AND AS FOR SOMETHING BLUE,

35:07.530 --> 35:09.259
WELL, THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF

35:09.270 --> 35:10.294
BLUE DAYS LIVING WITH THE

35:10.300 --> 35:11.836
WORLD'S BIGGEST ASSHOLE, SO

35:11.840 --> 35:13.637
ALL THAT'S MISSING IS SOMETHING

35:13.640 --> 35:18.873
OLD.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.848
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

35:20.850 --> 35:22.545
>> MY OLD DIAPHRAGM.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.710
>> OH, MY GOD.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.439
>> IT'S THE ONE I USED WITH

35:26.450 --> 35:27.678
PREGNANT, KIM BER.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.952
SOONER OR LATER, HE'S GONNA

35:28.960 --> 35:30.416
LEAVE.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.820
>> DID HE DO THIS TO YOU?

35:32.830 --> 35:35.321
ALL THIS BITTERNESS

35:35.330 --> 35:36.490
AS A RESULT OF LOVING HIM

35:36.500 --> 35:37.398
TOO MUCH?

35:37.400 --> 35:41.359
>> NO. I WAS ALWAYS A BITCH.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.418
>> OH, JESUS. I DIDN'T THINK I

35:57.420 --> 35:58.489
HAD THE POWER TO UPSET YOU THIS

35:58.490 --> 35:59.548
BADLY.

35:59.550 --> 36:00.744
>> I'M SO AFRAID I'M MAKING A

36:00.750 --> 36:04.288
MISTAKE, GINA.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.382
I'M GIVING UP EVERYTHING FOR

36:05.390 --> 36:10.657
HIM. MY CAREER, MERCHANDISING.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.525
I HAVEN'T EATEN IN DAYS SO I CAN

36:12.530 --> 36:14.566
FIT INTO THIS DRESS. IT JUST

36:14.570 --> 36:15.491
SEEMS LIKE I'M TRYING TO

36:15.500 --> 36:17.639
DISAPPEAR SO HE'LL ACCEPT ME.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.301
WHAT IF I JUST TURN INTO NOTHING

36:19.310 --> 36:20.538
AT ALL AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA

36:20.540 --> 36:22.508
END UP LOSING HIM ANYWAY.

36:22.510 --> 36:23.499
>> WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT

36:23.510 --> 36:24.647
OF THAT BEFORE THE INVITATIONS

36:24.650 --> 36:27.778
WENT OUT.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.248
OH, YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR EYE

36:30.250 --> 36:34.016

36:50.570 --> 36:54.802
CHOKE ON THESE WORDS, BUT

36:54.810 --> 36:57.870
CHRISTIAN LOVES YOU, KIMBER.

37:47.630 --> 37:48.892

37:48.900 --> 37:50.390
SHE WAS SO CUCKOO LAST NIGHT,

37:50.400 --> 37:51.492
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SHE

37:51.500 --> 37:55.391
DOESN'T EVEN SHOW UP.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.594
THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WISHES

37:56.600 --> 37:57.692
SHE WAS HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD

37:57.700 --> 37:59.065
AND I COULD JUST TELL EVERYBODY

37:59.070 --> 38:00.628
>> YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK. I SAW HER

38:00.640 --> 38:03.006
ON MY WAY IN. EVERYONE IS

38:03.010 --> 38:04.671
TERRIFIED BEFORE THEIR WEDDING,

38:04.680 --> 38:07.342
CHRISTIAN. YOU KNOW THAT CLICH

38:07.350 --> 38:08.749
ABOUT LIFE FLASHING BEFORE YOUR

38:08.750 --> 38:10.115
EYES WHEN YOU DIE?

38:10.120 --> 38:11.075
WELL, THE SAME IS TRUE OF

38:11.080 --> 38:13.640
WEDDINGS. EVERY REASON A

38:13.650 --> 38:15.880
MARRIAGE IS WRONG AND IMPOSSIBLE

38:15.890 --> 38:18.017
RISES TO THE SURFACE.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.487
THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MUCH

38:19.490 --> 38:22.823
CHAMPAGNE AT WEDDINGS.

38:22.830 --> 38:26.368
>> THAT'S WHY YOU SLEPT WITH ME,

38:26.370 --> 38:29.589
ISN'T IT?

38:29.600 --> 38:32.034
>> ALL MY FEARS ABOUT SEAN

38:32.040 --> 38:33.928
GOT TURNED INTO THE NEED TO FIND

38:33.940 --> 38:35.874
OUT IF YOU WERE REALLY THE ONE.

38:35.880 --> 38:41.512

SOMETHING UNRESOLVED BETWEEN US

38:43.720 --> 38:46.109
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.747

38:52.630 --> 38:54.723
