WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.972
EVE! EVE--HEY!

00:05.005 --> 00:07.641
CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.144
TIME TO BE CARVIN'
THAT INTO AN AWESOME RACER.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.047
UGH.
NOT THE FATHER-SON DERBY.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.015
DAD, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

00:15.049 --> 00:18.186
I CAN NO LONGER PASS
FOR AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.921
SAYS YOU.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.725
HEY, GRANDPA, WHAT'S THAT?

00:24.758 --> 00:27.195
IT'S A LIGHTNING-FAST
RACE CAR. VROOM!

00:27.228 --> 00:31.832
OH. GRANDMA TOLD ME
THIS DAY WOULD COME.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.535
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL RACE CAR,
GRANDPA.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.506
WHAT? I'M--I'M JUST PREPARING
HIM FOR THE INEVITABLE.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.374
I MEAN, HIS CLASS
ALREADY READ THE BOOK,

00:40.408 --> 00:42.076
"WHY GRANDPA
CAN'T FIND HIS HOUSE."

00:42.110 --> 00:43.877
WELL, MAYBE GRANDPA DOESN'T
WANT TO FIND HIS HOUSE,

00:43.911 --> 00:45.546
BECAUSE THERE'S A MEAN LADY
THAT LIVES THERE.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.014
OH, STOP IT.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.882
STOP MESSING AROUND
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK. COME ON.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.684
WE GOT A CAR TO BUILD.
HONEY, I DON'T THINK
SHE WANTS TO RACE

00:50.718 --> 00:52.019
LITTLE WOODEN CARS ANYMORE.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.688
I ASKED YOU LAST WEEK, RIGHT?
YOU SAID, "YEAH, ABSOLUTELY."

00:54.722 --> 00:56.190
YEAH, BUT I SAID IT LIKE...

00:56.224 --> 00:58.759
(sarcastically)
"YEAH, ABSOLUTELY."

00:58.792 --> 01:00.361
SOUNDS THE SAME TO ME.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.029
DAD, I'M SICK OF LOSING

01:02.062 --> 01:03.697
TO THOSE NERD ENGINEERS
FROM LOCKHEED MARTIN.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.533
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
COMPETING WITH 11-YEAR-OLDS

01:05.566 --> 01:08.269
IF YOU'VE BUILT THINGS THAT HAVE
LANDED ON ANOTHER PLANET.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.870
I SWEAR, THIS IS
GONNA BE OUR YEAR

01:09.903 --> 01:11.372
TO KICK
SOME AEROSPACE BUTT.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.275
(sarcastically)
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.744
OKAY, THAT ONE--THAT ONE
WAS VERY OBVIOUS.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.412
VERY--THIS IS YOUR FAULT,
YOU KNOW.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.047
OH. (chuckles)
YEAH, I HAD A FEELING

01:20.080 --> 01:22.082
THIS WAS WHERE
THIS WAS GONNA LAND.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.551
BECAUSE YOU NEVER SQUEEZED OUT
A SON FOR ME.

01:23.584 --> 01:28.556
HONEY, THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KEPT
GIVING ME "X" CHROMOSOMES...
WHAT--

01:28.589 --> 01:30.791
EVEN THOUGH EVERY SINGLE CELL
IN THIS BODY

01:30.824 --> 01:33.427
ALREADY HAS TWO OF THOSE.

01:33.461 --> 01:37.731
DON'T GET ALL SCIENCE-Y ON ME.
JUST SAY, "I'M SORRY."

01:37.765 --> 01:40.901
IF THIS IS A RACE CAR, GRANDPA,
WHERE'S THE MOTOR?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.102
IT DOESN'T NEED A MOTOR.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.306
IT'S POWERED BY YOUR GRANDMA'S
ARCHENEMY, GRAVITY.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.408
HEY. I HEARD THAT.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.643
YEAH, WELL, I'M JUST PREPARING
HIM FOR THE INEVITABLE.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.246
'CAUSE I THINK THIS WEEK
THEY'RE GONNA READ THAT BOOK,

01:52.280 --> 01:55.283
"WHY GRANDMA KEEPS TRIPPING
OVER HER BOOBS."

02:03.357 --> 02:06.827
GUYS. GUYS.
LAST NIGHT, I HAD A DREAM.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.163
JUST LIKE
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.130
NO. WAY BETTER.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.933
OKAY, THE THREE OF US,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.935
THE INGLORIOUS BAXTERS,
ARE GOING TO REUNITE

02:14.968 --> 02:16.804
TO MAKE A VIRAL VIDEO
SO POPULAR,

02:16.837 --> 02:19.340
IT'LL MAKE ME FAMOUS!

02:19.373 --> 02:21.675
JUST LIKE
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.611
AND SOMEDAY, PEOPLE ARE GONNA
TAKE THE DAY OFF OF WORK

02:23.644 --> 02:25.679
JUST TO CELEBRATE ME.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.114
AND THEY COULD HAVE
MATTRESS SALES,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.817
WHICH WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.352
OOH.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.154
SAYS THE SISTER
WHO HAD A BABY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.324
HEY. I WAS ALSO PRESIDENT
OF THE SPANISH CLUB.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.458
NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.293
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

02:39.327 --> 02:40.961
OF YOU GUYS POSTING STUFF
ON THE INTERNET.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.129
MOM, COME ON.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.297
IF MANDY'S SPREADING
SOMETHING VIRAL,

02:43.331 --> 02:45.132
YOU BETTER PRAY
IT'S ON THE INTERNET.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.034
(laughs and speaks indistinctly)

02:48.336 --> 02:50.003
WHAT'S OUR GIANT
HIT SONG CALLED?

02:50.037 --> 02:51.872
YOU READY? READY?
WAIT FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.173
"LOVE ARROW."

02:53.207 --> 02:54.875
OH, GROSS.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.344
NO, WAIT, EVE,
THAT'S NOT GROSS.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.478
I MEAN, IT REFERS TO CUPID.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.814
VALENTINE'S DAY, RIGHT,
MANDY?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.183
SURE.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.518
SO, YEAH.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.019
CAN WE HEAR A BIT? HUH?

03:06.053 --> 03:08.322
OH. WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S READY.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.057
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T
EVEN REALLY...

03:10.090 --> 03:11.992
* TAKE YOUR AIM

03:12.025 --> 03:13.394
* STAND AND DELIVER

03:13.427 --> 03:14.995
* DRAW YOUR BOW

03:15.028 --> 03:16.830
* AND MAKE ME QUIVER

03:16.864 --> 03:20.167
* YOU'RE TED NUGENT,
AND I'M A SPARROW *

03:20.200 --> 03:23.337
* OBLITERATE ME
WITH YOUR--UNH--LOVE ARROW *

03:23.371 --> 03:26.840
THEN IT GOES...
* LOVE ARROW, LOVE ARROW

03:26.874 --> 03:29.343
* SHE LOVES HIS--UNH--SSS!

03:29.377 --> 03:30.411
* LOVE ARROW

03:30.444 --> 03:32.112
LIKE THAT.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.052
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY, MOM.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.423
(door opens)

03:42.456 --> 03:44.358
(Eve) HEY!
(Kristin) HELLO.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.193
SPECIAL DELIVERY
FOR THE BAXTER FAMILY.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.061
ONE KID, ONE CASE OF BEER.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.062
GRANDPA!

03:49.096 --> 03:50.731
BOYD, BUDDY.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.032
WHAT IS THIS?
A LITTLE TWIST-OFF HERE?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.767
(imitates lid popping)

03:53.801 --> 03:55.068
RYAN, YOU PICKED UP BOYD
FROM KINDERGARTEN

03:55.102 --> 03:56.370
WITH THE BEER TRUCK?

03:56.404 --> 03:59.039
YEAH. MAKES BOYD LOOK COOL.
AND I MADE A FEW BUCKS

03:59.072 --> 04:01.241
OFF THAT SLEEPY TEACHER
WITH THE RED NOSE.
(semitruck horn honks)

04:01.275 --> 04:02.576
IS THAT YOUR TRUCK?

04:02.610 --> 04:05.212
YES. BOYD'S FRIEND DYLAN
WON'T LEAVE THE HORN ALONE.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.381
(honk)
GOD, I HATE CARPOOL DAY.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.216
(honking continues)

04:09.249 --> 04:12.553
(door closes)
LOOK, GRANDPA, I KNOW ALL
MY NUMBERS UP TO 31.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.389
THAT'S A WEIRD PLACE
TO RUN OUT OF GAS.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.891
BUT CONGRATULATIONS,
EXCEPT YOU GOT THE WRONG PAPER.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.727
IT SAYS "BOYD VOGELSON"
ON HERE.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.629
YEAH. THAT'S RYAN'S
LAST NAME.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.632
WHAT'S RYAN'S LAST NAME
DOING ON BOYD BAXTER'S PAPER?

04:24.665 --> 04:27.301
SHOULD I GET YOU A BEER,
GRANDPA?

04:27.335 --> 04:28.402
NO. NO, NO, NO, HONEY.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.637
JUST GO IN THE LIVING ROOM
AND PLAY.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.472
SOMEBODY SHOULD
GET ME A BEER.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.908
OKAY, RYAN ASKED IF BOYD COULD
USE HIS LAST NAME AT SCHOOL.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.276
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.111
WELL, IF HE CAN'T COUNT
PAST 31,

04:38.145 --> 04:40.748
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED
TO SPELL "VOGELSON"?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.417
I THINK IT'S A NICE SIGN
OF RYAN'S COMMITMENT, OKAY?

04:43.451 --> 04:44.985
HE'S REALLY STEPPED UP
WITH BOYD,

04:45.018 --> 04:46.754
AND HE IS THE FATHER.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE IS THE FATHER.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.956
HE'S THE ONE THAT CHANGED
ALL THOSE DIRTY DIAPERS.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.991
WAIT A SECOND. NO, IT WASN'T.
IT WAS ME.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.327
DAD.
AND THAT KID DROPPED SOME BOMBS.
YOU REMEMBER THAT,

04:53.361 --> 04:56.597
WHEN HE PUNCHED
RIGHT THROUGH A CLOTH DIAPER?

04:56.630 --> 04:57.931
HONEY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE NOT THINKING

04:57.965 --> 04:59.800
OF LEGALLY CHANGING
BOYD'S NAME, ARE YOU?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.335
MAYBE.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.470
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "MAYBE"?

05:02.503 --> 05:05.105
WHAT ABOUT THE BAXTERS?
MIKE AND BOYD BAXTER?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.642
YEAH, WOW.
THAT'S A NICE LIST OF BAXTERS.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.944
KIDS TAKE THEIR FATHERS'
LAST NAMES, OKAY?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.346
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE

05:12.380 --> 05:13.981
THAT WAS FOR DOING THINGS
THE TRADITIONAL WAY.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.315
TRADITIONAL WAY--

05:15.349 --> 05:16.316
YOU MEAN LIKE KNOCKING UP
A GIRL, THEN LEAVING,

05:16.350 --> 05:17.685
AND COMING BACK
WHEN THE GOING GETS EASY?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.286
YOU MEAN THAT TRADITION?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.488
DAD, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.691
YEAH, DAD, NO FAIR DESCRIBING
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

05:23.724 --> 05:27.528
HE WAS BORN A BAXTER.
HE'S LIVED IN A BAXTER HOUSE.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.130
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS
KID'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A BAXTER.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.834
QUICK, GRANDMA.
PULL MY FINGER.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.310
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING,
MR. B.?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.479
IT'S NOT "MR. B."
IT'S "MIKE BAXTER."

05:45.513 --> 05:47.981
BAXTER'S MY LAST NAME.
ALWAYS WAS, ALWAYS WILL BE.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.483
BAXTER, BAXTER, BAXTER.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.652
SOMETHING'S EATING AT YOU, MIKE?
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.822
RYAN WANTS TO CHANGE
BOYD'S NAME TO "VOGELSON."

05:54.855 --> 05:57.224
"VOGELSON BAXTER"?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.395
I LIKE "BOYD" BETTER.

06:01.429 --> 06:04.532
"VOGELSON" WOULD BE
HIS LAST NAME, YOU IDIOT.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.367
"VOGELSON VOGELSON"?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.405
OKAY, NOW THAT I LIKE.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.742
SO BOYD IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
OF PASSING DOWN THE BAXTER NAME?

06:14.775 --> 06:16.209
YEAH.
CURSED WITH THREE GIRLS,

06:16.243 --> 06:21.014
THE LINE NOW ENDS WHEN YOU
SHUFFLE OFF THIS MORTAL COIL.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.349
WHEN YOU DIE.
I GOT IT.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.218
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
ALWAYS ADOPT A SON.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.422
IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE A BABY.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.023
COULD JUST BE
SOME YOUNG MAN,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.392
YEARNING FOR
A FATHER FIGURE IN HIS LIFE.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.262
OR YOU COULD DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.598
OF COURSE, VANESSA PROBABLY
COULDN'T PARTICIPATE,

06:37.631 --> 06:41.702
BUT YOU GUYS COULD WORK IT OUT.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S A GOOD SPORT.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.238
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE YOU'VE
ONLY BEEN DIVORCED FOUR TIMES.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.374
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO PASS ON YOUR NAME,

06:47.407 --> 06:48.942
BUT YOU PUT A LOT
OF TIME IN WITH THIS KID...
RIGHT.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.410
YOU'RE GONNA PASS ALONG
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.879
WHAT?
MEMORIES.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.714
HE'S NOT GONNA REMEMBER
ANYTHING I DID WITH HIM

06:53.747 --> 06:54.915
BEFORE RYAN CAME ALONG.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
LISTEN--YOU TAKE
A 2-YEAR-OLD TO SeaWorld,

06:56.917 --> 07:00.253
THE WHALE HAS A BETTER CHANCE
OF REMEMBERING THAT.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.122
BOY, IF SOMEONE
TOOK ME TO SeaWorld,

07:02.155 --> 07:04.257
I'D SURE REMEMBER IT.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.926
BOYD IS OLDER NOW.
MAKE SOME NEW MEMORIES.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.927
LIKE WHAT?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.428
DIDN'T YOU SAY EVE WAS BAILING

07:08.462 --> 07:10.430
ON THAT FATHER-SON DERBY
THIS YEAR?

07:10.464 --> 07:11.899
WELL, THERE'S AN OPENING.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.567
YOU CAN ENTER
THE RACE WITH BOYD.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.636
(coughs) OR KYLE. HE'S FREE.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.970
BETTER THAN BUILDING A CAR.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.072
YOU'RE BUILDING MEMORIES
TO LAST A LIFETIME.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.073
RIGHT. RIGHT.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.475
AND WHEN WE WIN THAT RACE,

07:21.509 --> 07:23.577
I'LL PUT HIS REAL NAME
ON THAT TROPHY--

07:23.611 --> 07:25.579
"BOYD BAXTER."

07:25.613 --> 07:28.448
OR "KYLE ANDERSON."

07:32.019 --> 07:38.458
(whirring)

07:38.492 --> 07:39.760
(motor turns off)

07:39.793 --> 07:42.095
WELL, STARTING TO LOOK
LIKE A CAR NOW, ISN'T IT?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.964
IS IT TIME
FOR ME TO HELP AGAIN?

07:43.997 --> 07:44.998
OKAY.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.534
(blows)

07:48.636 --> 07:50.504
(coughs)

07:50.538 --> 07:52.506
IT'S A LITTLE MOIST.

07:52.540 --> 07:56.944
THAT'S WHY GRANDPA DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OF YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.946
ARE WE GONNA WIN
THE RACE, GRANDPA?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.814
OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA WIN.
WE'RE BAXTERS. WE'RE WINNERS.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.949
(whirring resumes)

08:01.982 --> 08:04.484
MY DAD SAYS
I'M A VO-GEL-SON.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.453
VOGELSON, YEAH. YOU KNOW,
IT STARTS WITH A "V."

08:06.486 --> 08:08.288
"V" IS AT
THE END OF THE ALPHABET.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.857
SO?
"SO"?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.192
LET'S SAY THESE DRILL BITS HERE
ARE POPSICLES.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.326
AND WE'RE GONNA HAND 'EM OUT
ALPHABETICALLY

08:13.360 --> 08:14.327
TO EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

08:14.361 --> 08:15.996
FIRST NAME WOULD BE--WHAT?
ALLEN?

08:16.029 --> 08:16.997
THEY GET THEIRS.
(clatter)

08:17.030 --> 08:19.132
THEN BAXTER.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.635
YEAH. GOT A BIG,
NICE ORANGE FOR ME.
(clatter)

08:21.669 --> 08:24.471
"C" IS COLSON.
THEY GET THEIRS.
(clatter)

08:24.504 --> 08:26.473
"D" IS DYKSTRA.
THEY GET THEIRS.
(clatter)

08:26.506 --> 08:28.141
"E" IS EINSTEIN--

08:28.175 --> 08:31.478
OF COURSE, HE GETS HIS,
'CAUSE HE'S A SMART GUY.
(clatter)

08:31.511 --> 08:34.481
NOTHING LEFT FOR V's.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.984
DADDY, I WANNA BE
A BAXTER.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.052
THE KID HAS GOT A POINT.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.854
BOYD, YOUR NAME IS VOGELSON

08:40.888 --> 08:42.656
BECAUSE YOUR DADDY'S NAME
IS VOGELSON.

08:42.690 --> 08:43.824
SEE, YOUR DADDY
IS VERY OLD-FASHIONED.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.226
HE DOESN'T THINK MOMMIES
COUNT AS MUCH AS DADDIES.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.995
AND YOU KNOW
WHO ELSE THINKS THAT,

08:48.028 --> 08:49.529
IS THE TALIBAN.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.533
TALIBAN? WHAT'S THAT?

08:53.567 --> 08:54.534
WILD GROUP OF EXTREMISTS.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.836
WACK-A-DOODLES. I TOLD YOU.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.573
BUT I KIND OF AGREE WITH THEM
ABOUT WOMEN DRIVERS.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.074
RIGHT, PAL?

09:01.108 --> 09:04.011
THAT'S A NICE TRY, MIKE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.679
BUT SERIOUSLY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:05.713 --> 09:08.916
WE'RE BUILDING A RACE CAR
FOR THE FATHER-SON DERBY.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.183
OH. FATHER-SON.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.919
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING MY SON SHOULD DO

09:11.952 --> 09:13.386
WITH HIS ACTUAL FATHER.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.521
THIS IS KIND OF OUR THING.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.056
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.691
WE'LL BOTH MAKE
A PINEWOOD CAR,

09:17.725 --> 09:19.960
AND BOYD CAN DECIDE WHICH ONE
HE WANTS TO ENTER IN THE RACE.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.563
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT A DEAL.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.699
BUT I GOT
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YA--

09:25.733 --> 09:28.535
YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.704
AND WHERE DO I GET
ONE OF THESE KITS?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.713
HONEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.049
IT MAKES SENSE THAT RYAN WOULD
WANT BOYD TO HAVE HIS LAST NAME.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.717
BUT WHAT I DON'T GET

09:43.751 --> 09:45.719
IS WHY YOU LET HIM
HAVE HIS WAY SO EASILY.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.055
FORCE OF HABIT?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.057
I LIKE THAT RYAN FEELS
SO CONNECTED TO BOYD.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.892
YOU KNOW, WE'RE STARTING TO FEEL
MORE LIKE A FAMILY,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.593
IN OUR OWN WEIRD WAY.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.296
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER KEEPING
YOUR MAIDEN NAME, MOM?

09:56.329 --> 09:58.632
NO. NO, NO, NO. I NEVER LIKED
THE MESSAGE THAT SENDS.

09:58.666 --> 10:02.135
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPEN.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.238
IN RETROSPECT,
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.075
A LOT OF COUPLES
ARE HYPHENATING THESE DAYS.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.910
OH, GOD. DO YOU KNOW
WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE HYPHENATED?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.912
MY FRIEND
MONICA'S PARENTS.
YEAH?

10:11.945 --> 10:15.148
VALERIE JOHNSON
AND STEVE HOLDER.

10:16.283 --> 10:20.487
(laughs)

10:20.520 --> 10:23.290
"JOHNSON-HOLDER"?
I DON'T GET IT.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.291
(laughs)

10:24.324 --> 10:25.659
WELL, ALL I KNOW

10:25.693 --> 10:27.828
IS WHEN I STEPPED DOWN
AS P.T.A. PRESIDENT,

10:27.861 --> 10:31.598
I PASS THE BATON
INTO THE VERY EXPERIENCED HANDS

10:31.631 --> 10:34.601
OF VALERIE JOHNSON-HOLDER.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.770
YOU ALWAYS WANNA WASH UP

10:36.804 --> 10:39.472
AFTER SHAKIN' HANDS
WITH A JOHNSON-HOLDER.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.808
(laughter)

10:40.841 --> 10:41.809
WAIT. WHY?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.277
(laughter)

10:44.311 --> 10:45.779
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.781
OH, WE'RE JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE JOHNSON-HOLDERS.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.783
OH. YEAH. (chuckles)

10:49.817 --> 10:51.952
HEY, DAD, HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THE CAR?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.787
IT'S GREAT.
JUST NEEDS MORE LUBRICATION.

10:53.821 --> 10:54.788
FOR THE WHEELS?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.623
NO. THE MECHANIC.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.292
(cap fizzes)

10:59.326 --> 11:01.962
* LOVE ARROW

11:01.995 --> 11:04.364
* I LOVE HIS
* SHE LOVES HIS

11:04.397 --> 11:05.699
* LOVE ARROW

11:05.733 --> 11:07.801
SO OKAY,
THAT WAS YOUR CUE, KYLE.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.470
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HIT ME
WITH THE LOVE ARROW, REMEMBER?
(music stops)

11:10.503 --> 11:12.305
WHY DON'T WE ALL
GET HIT WITH LOVE ARROWS?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.174
UH, DOES EVERYONE IN
DESTINY'S CHILD MARRY JAY-Z,

11:14.207 --> 11:15.976
OR JUST BEYONCE?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.811
HEY, UH,
SORRY I MISSED MY CUE.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.646
I WAS DISTRACTED
BY YOUR AWESOME DANCING.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.715
AW, THANK YOU.
UM, GIRLS, YOU CAN TAKE FIVE.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.818
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF ANYONE'S SAID THIS,

11:24.852 --> 11:27.721
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN GIRLS DANCE,
YOU REALLY NOTICE

11:27.755 --> 11:30.490
HOW THE DIFFERENT PARTS
OF THEIR BODIES MOVE.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.559
YOU LIKE THE WAY
THAT I DANCE?

11:32.592 --> 11:34.394
I DIDN'T HATE IT.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.495
ALL RIGHT!

11:35.528 --> 11:37.697
OH, CRAP, HERE COMES MR. ALZATE.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.665
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY?

11:38.698 --> 11:39.833
NO, NO, NO. GUYS,
IT'S COOL. HE GETS IT.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.501
HE'S AN ARTIST.
COME ON NOW.

11:41.534 --> 11:46.073
I'M LAYING THIS DOWN ONE TIME,
AND THEN I AM GONE, ALL RIGHTY?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.707
ROLLING.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.708
HERE WE GO.

11:48.742 --> 11:52.445
***

11:59.452 --> 12:01.388
ALL RIGHT.

12:02.790 --> 12:07.094
AND THAT'S WHY GOD
GAVE GOATS SKIN.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.129
TA-TA.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.370
(keys and mouse clicking)

12:17.404 --> 12:19.706
AH, THE GREAT OUTDOORS.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.208
ONE THING GOOD ABOUT GETTING
AWAY FROM THE CITY LIGHTS--

12:21.241 --> 12:24.044
YOU CAN SEE
ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL STARS.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.446
LOOK UP THERE--POLARIS.
(tinkling sound)

12:26.479 --> 12:28.215
THERE'S SIRIUS RIGHT THERE.
(tinkling sound)

12:28.248 --> 12:31.218
OVER THERE--RIDICULOUS.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.786
(dinging sound)

12:32.820 --> 12:34.054
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.223
I-I DON'T REALLY KNOW MY
STAR NAMES TOO WELL, ALL RIGHT?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.558
TIME WAS WHEN AN ASTRONOMER
FOUND A STAR,

12:38.591 --> 12:39.960
HE GOT TO NAME IT.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.796
THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE,
BECAUSE HE DID THE WORK, RIGHT?

12:42.830 --> 12:45.432
NOWADAYS, ANY LOSER
WHO FORGOT HIS WIFE'S BIRTHDAY

12:45.465 --> 12:48.735
CAN NAME A STAR
FOR, LIKE, 50 BUCKS.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.571
UP THERE NEXT
TO THE REGAL POLARIS?

12:51.604 --> 12:54.908
THAT'S IRENE PARTLOW.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.409
EVEN THOUGH HE SPENT THE MONEY,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.912
MR. PARTLOW'S RECENT ATTEMPTS
TO LAND ON HER

12:58.946 --> 13:02.649
HAVE BEEN QUITE UNSUCCESSFUL.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.484
THE POINT IS, IF YOU DON'T
PUT IN THE EFFORT,

13:04.517 --> 13:06.786
YOU SHOULDN'T GET
THE NAMING RIGHTS.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.588
THE SAME GOES FOR FATHERS.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.757
USED TO BE PRETTY DARN SIMPLE,
WASN'T IT?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.325
KIDS TOOK THE OLD MAN'S NAME.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.929
AND THEIR MOTHER'S NAME?
WELL, ONLY REALLY RELEVANT

13:15.963 --> 13:19.766
AS A SECURITY QUESTION
AT THE BANK.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.002
BUT WHAT ABOUT DEADBEAT DADS?

13:22.035 --> 13:24.337
SHOULD THEIR KIDS
BE WALKING AROUND

13:24.371 --> 13:27.107
AS LITTLE JOHNNY DEADBEAT
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.109
HERE'S A CRAZY THOUGHT--

13:29.142 --> 13:32.645
LET'S HONOR THE WOMAN
WHO ACTUALLY RAISES HER KID.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.614
LET HER GIVE THE KID HER NAME.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.450
WOW. JUST THINK--

13:37.484 --> 13:39.452
THEN OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT

13:39.486 --> 13:42.856
WOULD BE BARRY DUNHAM.

13:42.890 --> 13:47.294
SOUNDS LIKE A GUY I'D BUY
HEALTH INSURANCE FROM.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.964
AW, HELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE
A CHOICE THERE, DID WE?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.799
GOOD NIGHT, IRENE!

14:02.675 --> 14:04.377
CAN I PUT ON
THE "TEAM BAXTER" DECAL?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.179
LET'S NOT DO IT JUST YET.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.881
IF WE GET AN AIR BUBBLE
TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THERE,

14:07.915 --> 14:09.316
IT'S GONNA ADD
WIND RESISTANCE.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.051
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO WIN THE RACE LIKE THAT.

14:11.084 --> 14:14.654
MY DAD LET ME GLUE
THE GOOGLY EYES ON HIS CAR.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.856
WHY DO YOU WANT
GOOGLY EYES ON A CAR?

14:16.890 --> 14:23.163
SO I CAN SEE
WHERE IT'S GOING.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.831
I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE IT'S NOT GOING--

14:24.864 --> 14:26.833
THE WINNER'S CIRCLE.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.568
WANNA TOSS THE BALL AROUND?

14:28.601 --> 14:30.003
CAN'T. WE'RE JUST PUTTING
THE FINISHING TOUCHES

14:30.037 --> 14:31.238
ON THE BAXTER BULLET.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.241
DID YOU TAPER THE AXLE HEADS
AND SAND DOWN THE WHEEL TREAD?

14:34.274 --> 14:35.242
DID WE, BOYD?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.877
IS THE POPE POLISH?

14:38.912 --> 14:40.247
THAT POPE DIED, DAD.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.917
I KNOW. BUT IT'S STILL FUNNY
COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.553
PLUS I DIDN'T WANT TO
TEACH HIM THE OTHER ONE...

14:46.586 --> 14:48.688
DOES A BEAR POOP
IN THE WOODS?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.224
BUT I DID ANYWAY.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.225
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.027
GO THROW THE BALL
WITH YOUR AUNT,

14:54.061 --> 14:55.895
AND WE'LL PUT THE DECALS ON
IN A MINUTE, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.031
HAVE YOU EVEN LET BOYD
TOUCH THAT CAR?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.433
HE'LL BE TOUCHIN' THAT TROPHY
WITH HIS REAL NAME ON IT

15:00.467 --> 15:01.868
WHEN WE WIN THIS THING.
(door closes)

15:01.901 --> 15:04.871
SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT RYAN
GIVING BOYD HIS LAST NAME?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.539
NO, IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THAT.
YOU KNOW HOW MAD I WAS

15:06.573 --> 15:08.041
WHEN KRIS SAID
SHE WAS HAVING A BABY?

15:08.075 --> 15:11.044
YEAH, I STILL MISS
THAT GLASS COFFEE TABLE.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.745
I WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF
EXCITED

15:12.779 --> 15:14.381
THAT WE'D HAVE
ANOTHER BABY IN THE HOUSE.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.049
I KNOW, AND WHEN KRISTIN
HAD A SON,

15:16.083 --> 15:17.384
YOU WERE SO HAPPY,
YOU STARTED HUGGING EVERYBODY

15:17.417 --> 15:18.952
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.954
AND DON'T THINK I DIDN'T NOTICE
YOU DRAGGING IT OUT

15:20.988 --> 15:22.889
WITH THAT ONE NURSE--
HEATHER.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.593
YOU NEVER FORGET THESE
LITTLE MINUTE DETAILS, RIGHT?

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
AND HER NAME WAS HEIDI.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.965
MM.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.901
BUT THE FACT IS, ONCE WE
REALIZED WE WERE HAVING A BOY,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.403
IT WAS LIKE I WAS GETTING
A BOY OF MY VERY OWN,

15:36.436 --> 15:37.971
YOU KNOW? KIND OF.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.973
AND NOW RYAN'S COME ALONG,
AND, UM...

15:40.007 --> 15:42.642
SEEMS LIKE HE WANTS
TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.911
HONEY, RYAN IS NOT TRYING
TO TAKE BOYD AWAY FROM YOU.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.247
HE'S JUST TRYING TO CREATE
SOMETHING WITH BOYD

15:47.280 --> 15:49.416
THAT YOU--YOU ALREADY HAVE.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.985
HMM? HERE HE COMES.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.087
(kisses)
(Ryan) GENTLEMEN...

15:54.121 --> 15:55.588
START YOUR ENGINES.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.257
BEHOLD...

15:57.290 --> 16:00.793
THE VogelsWagen.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.831
OOH.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.767
IT'S LOOKIN'
RIGHT AT YOU, MIKE.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.602
I SEE THAT.
NICE PINWHEEL.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.472
YOU KNOW, THE OBJECT
IS TO CUT WIND RESISTANCE,

16:12.505 --> 16:13.640
NOT ADD TO IT.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.775
I WAS TRYING TO TEACH BOYD
ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.844
SEE, THE PROPELLER
HARNESSES WIND POWER

16:17.877 --> 16:20.680
AND TRANSFERS IT
TO THE WHEELS.

16:20.713 --> 16:21.781
YOU ENGINEERED THIS

16:21.814 --> 16:23.283
SO THE WINDMILL
POWERS THE REAR WHEELS?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.786
NO. WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE,
A NERD FROM LOCKHEED?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.655
WELL, WE GOT OUR CARS READY.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.790
THE TRACK'S OUT THERE.
YOU WANNA DO A LITTLE PRE-RACE?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.025
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.160
HEY, HEY.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.195
WANNA MAKE IT
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.464
UH, WE'VE ALREADY
GOT COOL NAMES, GOOGLY EYES--

16:37.497 --> 16:40.333
HOW MUCH MORE INTERESTING
CAN IT GET?

16:43.670 --> 16:44.637
YOU NERVOUS, MIKE?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.174
OH, I'M SHIVERING.
YOU SHOULD BE.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.643
BECAUSE DER VogelsWagen
SHOWS NO MERCY.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.381
IT ALSO SHOWS NO UNDERSTANDING
OF BASIC PHYSICS.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.483
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE
WHICH ONE OF THESE BEAUTIES

16:56.516 --> 16:57.717
BOYD'S GONNA TAKE
TO THE BIG DANCE.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.152
YOU WANNA COUNT US OFF,
BUDDY?

16:59.186 --> 17:02.655
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TO 32,
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.658
ON YOUR MARKS,
GET SET, GO!

17:05.692 --> 17:06.659
(clacks)

17:06.693 --> 17:07.827
GO! GO! GO! GO!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.229
(Eve) WHOO!
YEAH!

17:09.262 --> 17:10.697
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.999
AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF WHAT THOSE BOYS FROM LOCKHEED

17:13.032 --> 17:15.502
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH
RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT THAT.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.036
DAD, DAD!
MY PROPELLER WORKED!

17:17.070 --> 17:19.706
GRANDPA, DID YOU SEE
MY PROPELLER SPIN?

17:19.739 --> 17:23.343
YEAH. YOU SEE WHAT CAR'S
IN THE WINNER'S CIRCLE?

17:23.376 --> 17:26.713
BUT NOTHING ON YOUR CAR SPINS.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.082
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
