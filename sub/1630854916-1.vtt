WEBVTT

00:24.320 --> 00:26.320
No!

00:27.880 --> 00:29.800
No, please!

00:30.240 --> 00:32.200
Sarah! Sarah!

00:37.720 --> 00:39.360
Help!

01:28.040 --> 01:29.800
UNITED STATES
- 1872

01:29.800 --> 01:33.520
Seven years after the end of the
Civil War, slavery was abolished.

01:33.520 --> 01:40.440
In the southern states, however, blacks continue
to suffer massive discrimination and violence.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.400
Somewhere in Texas a black
man and a young white woman

01:44.400 --> 01:52.720
founded a city, in which every human being
could live free and as equals: New Babylon

02:07.320 --> 02:09.280
Welcome gentlemen!

02:09.280 --> 02:10.960
- You know the rules, honey.
- All right.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.400
To welcome you on full-moon nights,
we need your support. Thank you.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.680
What's your name, darling?

02:15.680 --> 02:17.240
Corman, ma'am.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.080
1871 Colt Open Top for Mr. Corman.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.240
- You wanna have fun, right?
- Yeah!

02:23.240 --> 02:24.680
Let's play. Be generous,

02:24.680 --> 02:27.960
- that's the rule.
- Cavalry... Navy...

02:27.960 --> 02:31.840
As usual, we take good care
of your weapons until dawn.

02:40.474 --> 02:47.659
- New Babylon -

02:55.360 --> 02:58.160
You're doing really well, okay?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.840
- I can't anymore!
- Breathe... Hattie.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.280
- Breathe... good!
- I can't make it, Sarah!

03:02.280 --> 03:04.360
Good! Just make one last effort.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.040
OK, now you can push!

03:08.040 --> 03:10.800
OK, now just push!

03:16.400 --> 03:18.160
He's beautiful.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.280
Brothers and sisters, a toast to life.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.240
- To life!
- And enough drink

03:29.240 --> 03:32.120
to forget why it cares
so little about us!

03:32.120 --> 03:34.080
You can say that again!

03:34.080 --> 03:37.800
Now, let us entertain our rich
guests and empty their pockets.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.120
Come on!

03:53.720 --> 03:55.920
Excuse me...

03:55.920 --> 03:59.360
Fight! Fight! Fight, fight, fight...

03:59.360 --> 04:03.120
Fight, fight, fight...

04:07.120 --> 04:10.200
- Whoo, yeah, whoo...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

04:11.320 --> 04:15.360
we are gathered here,
on this full moon night.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.920
We see you as our guest in New Babylon

04:20.920 --> 04:26.240
to witness Mr. Isaac Borowka,

04:26.240 --> 04:29.320
from Austria, across the sea...

04:29.320 --> 04:32.240
Whoo...

04:32.240 --> 04:34.040
...tear one of you apart,

04:35.960 --> 04:38.400
ripping your heart out your chest

04:39.040 --> 04:43.720
and cutting off your ears,
before offering them to the demons

04:43.720 --> 04:45.840
that rule the world outside these walls.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.080
- Yeah! Then...

04:49.080 --> 04:50.680
...we will get drunk.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.240
Yes! Come on!

04:53.240 --> 04:54.800
And be merry...

04:54.800 --> 04:57.960
...until we lose every
last one of our senses!

05:00.600 --> 05:02.120
Yeah!

05:02.880 --> 05:04.280
Whoo!

05:04.280 --> 05:07.960
Now, which one of you is gonna
challenge our brother Isaac?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.560
Oh come on, are you scared?

05:10.880 --> 05:14.200
Did you come all this way for nothing?

05:15.800 --> 05:17.840
Oh, somebody gotta challenge!

05:21.120 --> 05:23.240
- Nobody?
- He bold!

05:30.040 --> 05:34.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a contender.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.120
Are you ready for your destiny?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.040
As you wish.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.880
If you win,

05:55.240 --> 05:58.680
your reward will be nothing
less than 100 dollars.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.160
Now go ahead and tell
these fine people your name.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
Django.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.440
- Say that again.
- You heard me.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.600
Ladies and gentlemen, one of your own

06:13.600 --> 06:16.080
intends to die for us tonight.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.040
- Glory to his blood.
- All right!

06:18.040 --> 06:20.840
Yeah... Whoo...

06:25.640 --> 06:31.320
Now, who among you is gonna
root for your friend, Django?

06:31.320 --> 06:33.480
Yes! Yeah!

06:33.520 --> 06:35.760
- Django...
- Who among you...

06:35.760 --> 06:37.840
...is gonna place bets on your friend?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.840
Django, Django, Django...

06:40.840 --> 06:43.360
My youngest Kevin, he's
gonna take your bets.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.120
That is 20 dollars, is
that all? Come on now...

07:06.400 --> 07:08.240
- Fight!
- Yeah, come on!

07:11.000 --> 07:12.760
Let the battle begin.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.720
Fight, fight, fight...

07:42.760 --> 07:45.080
Fight, fight, fight!

08:30.960 --> 08:32.280
Ah!

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
Kill him! Kill him!

08:45.440 --> 08:47.080
Kill him!

08:49.600 --> 08:51.000
Kill him!

08:52.040 --> 08:54.680
- Aah!
- Fight, fight, fight!

08:58.800 --> 09:00.040
Come on!

10:03.800 --> 10:06.000
Where did you say you
were from, stranger?

10:08.120 --> 10:10.400
Where's my money?

10:10.400 --> 10:14.120
Well, now I'm considering that
a donation to the poor community.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.680
Look at you.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.640
Such an important man...

10:35.360 --> 10:38.200
...but not a man of your word.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.960
Oh, I'm a man of my word.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.560
And my word is...

10:54.920 --> 11:00.600
...if you ain't gone by
sunrise, I will kill you.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.600
- Pay out all bets.
- Let's go get a drink.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.160
What's going on brother?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.000
Follow me.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.240
They're dying.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.400
Two others died yesterday.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
Father can't know about this.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
Did the Lady poison them?

12:22.600 --> 12:25.800
She didn't poison them. God did.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.480
Our father insists on mocking him
by welcoming thieves, murderers

12:29.520 --> 12:30.880
and whores into our city.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.880
If your God existed he'd love
this city and everybody in it.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.480
Our father has a vision.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.080
His vision...

12:45.760 --> 12:47.400
...is to be our tyrant.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.400
This land is cursed.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.880
Cursed.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.720
Hattie had a boy. A beautiful son.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.600
I'm glad it went well.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.840
Here.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.200
A stranger beat Isaac.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.440
How much did we lose?

13:40.600 --> 13:43.160
We lost most of what we had...

13:49.400 --> 13:52.640
You will see that our marriage
will restore everyone's confidence.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.360
Who's the man who run the fights?

14:09.360 --> 14:11.320
The owner of this crater.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.360
His name is John Ellis. He's our guide.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.720
They took us in. They gave us shelter.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.600
We killed a man, a man with...

14:24.880 --> 14:26.360
...very bad manners.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.200
Where are you running from, stranger?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.560
I'm not running, I'm
looking for someone.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.960
Someone. Does "someone" have a name?

14:35.960 --> 14:38.960
No, they, they lost this tobacco case.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.320
So you came all this way
just to return a tobacco case?

14:45.320 --> 14:46.840
That's funny to you?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.040
Sort of romantic.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.120
I'm afraid I've never seen it before.

14:53.240 --> 14:59.000
You've got about four hours until dawn.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.800
You've best get some rest.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.080
Pleasant dreams.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.520
Can I see this?

16:22.880 --> 16:24.440
Where did you get this?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.040
It was years ago.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.400
I got it in a little town...

16:32.760 --> 16:37.000
...about 500 miles down south.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.440
They build it, um...
what do you call it?

16:39.440 --> 16:44.040
A crater, a crater. Poor
folks, Negro folks mostly.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.840
Crazy people.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.400
- Who sold it to you?
- There was...

16:52.400 --> 16:55.960
...this one little white girl.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.840
Pretty face, but a lame
leg... plague leg...

17:02.840 --> 17:04.840
No idea why she...

17:05.680 --> 17:07.760
...how she ended up with them.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.080
No idea.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.040
- Ah!
- I was right about you, stranger.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.960
You can't be trusted.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.720
What's going on, Father?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.800
Get him out of here.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.560
What's going on?

21:25.657 --> 21:27.137
John Andrew Ellis,

21:27.137 --> 21:28.817
no man will die here tonight

21:28.817 --> 21:31.137
if you want the wedding
to happen tomorrow.

21:46.777 --> 21:49.337
Perhaps your destiny
is another, stranger.

21:58.457 --> 22:05.257
ELMDALE CITY
- 35 miles South of New Babylon

23:18.457 --> 23:21.337
Let's give them sinners
what they deserve, milady.

23:59.817 --> 24:03.457
My beloved Aunt Maribel has passed away.

24:04.337 --> 24:05.857
Come in.

24:20.897 --> 24:26.737
Dear sirs, for our guests we
have the best cook in the county.

24:28.617 --> 24:31.657
You can eat and fuck
to your heart's content,

24:31.657 --> 24:33.777
it's all included in the price.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.697
This way please.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.777
Come on over here...

27:56.497 --> 28:00.657
Good morning, gentlemen.
Hope you had fun in our city.

28:02.897 --> 28:04.897
- Cavalry...
- Yeah, that's mine.

28:05.737 --> 28:07.617
- Winchester.
- Yep...

28:07.617 --> 28:08.937
For you, sir...

28:10.217 --> 28:11.937
Artillery, sir...

29:03.857 --> 29:06.857
- He's dead.
- Did I do well?

29:06.857 --> 29:08.537
Oh, you did great.

29:19.497 --> 29:21.377
You know what the Comanche say?

29:23.057 --> 29:25.577
If you take its heart
out and you bury it,

29:26.617 --> 29:30.817
the bison will run forever in
the prairies of the Great Spirit.

29:30.817 --> 29:32.937
And you will inherit its strength.

29:35.897 --> 29:37.457
You wanna try that?

29:41.897 --> 29:43.377
Take your time.

29:58.857 --> 30:01.537
Ah!

30:10.457 --> 30:12.577
There ain't gonna be no wedding today.

30:12.577 --> 30:15.137
You ain't getting married. You ain't!

30:15.137 --> 30:16.937
You got that?

30:16.937 --> 30:19.617
I will slit your throat while
you sleep, mark my words.

30:19.617 --> 30:21.737
Say you won't.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.297
You're crazy.

30:25.297 --> 30:27.057
You will not get married.

30:28.017 --> 30:29.817
You will never replace my mother.

31:11.417 --> 31:13.337
Mom?

31:13.337 --> 31:14.937
I'm here, my love.

31:18.697 --> 31:22.537
Abby made soufflÃ© for
dinner. She kept some for you.

31:23.697 --> 31:25.217
Oh, that's sweet.

31:26.337 --> 31:30.097
I'll eat it now, will
you keep me company?

31:44.897 --> 31:46.457
Where have you been?

31:48.697 --> 31:51.177
Spreading the Lord's word on Earth.

32:09.817 --> 32:11.377
Did he do it again?

32:12.817 --> 32:14.737
He's getting worse.

32:14.737 --> 32:16.577
You really should tell Father.

32:20.697 --> 32:22.257
He's crazy about you.

32:24.577 --> 32:26.297
Where's the stranger?

32:26.297 --> 32:30.017
In prison. Father will deal
with him after the ceremony.

33:15.937 --> 33:17.777
As soon as Hattie's able,

33:20.697 --> 33:22.457
we're aiming to leave.

33:33.657 --> 33:38.697
Hattie's got no milk.
She's not eating enough.

33:42.737 --> 33:45.137
So you're going back to being a slave.

33:50.777 --> 33:55.097
We fought the Civil War, things
are supposed to be different now.

33:56.417 --> 34:01.897
"Supposed to be" and "is" is two
different things, and you know that.

34:17.737 --> 34:19.297
Come in.

34:20.537 --> 34:21.817
Milady.

34:23.897 --> 34:25.497
They get married today.

34:39.417 --> 34:43.297
Brothers and sisters,
citizens of New Babylon.

34:44.497 --> 34:49.097
When I come into your
homes, you trust me

34:49.097 --> 34:52.097
with bringing your
babies into this world.

34:52.097 --> 34:57.777
They're all born in
pain, covered in blood...

34:57.777 --> 34:59.857
...screaming.

34:59.857 --> 35:02.617
But I see your eyes
gazing upon those babies

35:02.617 --> 35:05.017
and I know what you're feeling.

35:05.017 --> 35:08.697
You're afraid for their future
and that rich people of Elmdale

35:08.697 --> 35:10.817
will frighten and divide us.

35:11.897 --> 35:13.177
How much do we have left?

35:13.177 --> 35:14.857
One month's worth.

35:14.857 --> 35:17.897
Now's the time to stand
together and hold fast.

35:17.897 --> 35:22.457
Let us not be intimidated by the
hatred that the Lady feels for us.

35:22.457 --> 35:25.057
Take my family's share down by half.

35:25.057 --> 35:28.497
- John, that's not necessary.
- That's not for you to decide.

35:28.497 --> 35:33.497
I am marrying John today because
I have faith in his vision.

35:33.497 --> 35:36.097
I have been in this
community since childhood.

35:36.097 --> 35:39.937
And together we built
this place, this haven.

35:39.937 --> 35:44.577
And that's why we won't ever let it die.

35:44.577 --> 35:47.977
- We are free.
- Yeah! Whoo!

36:20.217 --> 36:23.177
Margaret, we're back.

36:23.177 --> 36:26.537
Mom! Mom! We shot a buffalo!

36:26.537 --> 36:29.257
- Daddy!
- I was worried sick!

36:29.257 --> 36:31.857
Who's tired of porridge?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.017
We have enough meat
for the whole winter.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.537
Yay!

36:35.537 --> 36:37.697
Elijah, let's dry it!

36:37.697 --> 36:39.977
I'm talking to you, Julian.

36:39.977 --> 36:42.497
You're so beautiful when you're mad.

36:42.497 --> 36:45.377
And no more smooching my
sister. Come and give me a hand.

36:45.417 --> 36:50.257
And who wants some meat?
Some real meat, for everyone!

36:50.257 --> 36:52.017
Come here you little...

37:46.977 --> 37:48.737
Something's wrong with me.

37:53.977 --> 37:55.697
I understood.

38:08.577 --> 38:12.017
I wanna promise I'll
never do it again...

38:13.697 --> 38:15.097
...but I will.

38:23.057 --> 38:25.017
You're not condemned.

38:40.217 --> 38:41.937
Father says it's time.

39:04.017 --> 39:05.697
What are you doing?

39:09.177 --> 39:10.897
Dressing for the occasion.

42:39.417 --> 42:43.937
I stand before you here today,
in front of all our people,

42:45.657 --> 42:48.617
offering you, Sarah,

42:49.977 --> 42:51.897
my unconditional love

42:51.897 --> 42:54.297
and eternal devotion.

42:56.817 --> 42:58.017
Vowing...

42:59.497 --> 43:05.217
...to make you a pillar
of strength, love and hope,

43:07.017 --> 43:09.377
always to build our community.

43:48.617 --> 43:51.017
- I can't.
- Oh, Sarah, come on...
