WEBVTT

01:36.388 --> 01:38.265
Sir, there's something you need to see.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.562
The asteroid must have
decayed from a near-Jovian Trojan orbit,

01:43.562 --> 01:45.856
which is why
we haven't been able to see it until now.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.442
Looks like it passed too close to Jupiter
on its last go-around

01:48.442 --> 01:51.236
and was redirected
into the inner solar system.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.990
It appears to be coming in
on an elliptical Mars-crossing orbit.

01:54.990 --> 02:00.913
Looks like it's about 1.1 kilometers
in diameter. Not huge as these things go.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.665
And based on our orbital analysis
of its moon,

02:03.665 --> 02:06.793
the density of the asteroid is seven grams
per cubic centimeter.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.378
- Means it's full of metal, for sure.
- A special analysis tells us

02:09.378 --> 02:11.715
this asteroid
likely contains a colossal amount of--

02:11.715 --> 02:17.137
Iridium? Very rare on Earth.
And we already control most of it.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.889
Not this much.

02:18.889 --> 02:25.062
A conservative guess is
70,000 metric tons.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.607
Our estimates indicate
there's more iridium in 2003LC

02:28.607 --> 02:30.943
than has been mined
in the entire history of Earth.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.196
Iridium is going for about 294 a gram.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.782
Based on current mass estimates,
that's worth upwards of--

02:36.782 --> 02:39.117
...twenty trillion dollars and nicknamed

02:39.117 --> 02:40.744
the Goldilocks asteroid.

02:40.744 --> 02:44.831
If it is able to be harnessed
and its iridium mined in Mars orbit,

02:44.831 --> 02:49.586
economists predict it will lead to another
technological revolution here on Earth.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.005
President Korzhenko
has expressed skepticism

02:52.005 --> 02:54.800
that the asteroid is in fact
made of iridium at all,

02:54.800 --> 02:58.554
insisting that the USSR
remains the only reliable supplier.

02:58.554 --> 02:59.638
Let me remind you

02:59.638 --> 03:02.474
what happened after
NASA's last great discovery, Helium-3.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.020
Job cuts, protests, domestic terrorism.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.524
...traveling through space
at tens of thousands of miles per hour.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.943
And the window to capture it
is closing quickly.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.153
In approximately six months,

03:15.153 --> 03:18.991
the asteroid's new trajectory will send it
out of reach for good.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.188
<i>Commander Poole.</i>

05:55.230 --> 05:56.315
Commander.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.029
What time is it?

06:03.155 --> 06:05.199
It's nearly 1:00 a.m., ma'am.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.785
But I thought it best to wake you.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.205
What's happened?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.124
Something incredible.

06:18.003 --> 06:21.340
<i>This asteroid, it's an amazing discovery.</i>

06:21.340 --> 06:24.218
<i>It is going to improve life on Earth immeasurably.</i>

06:24.885 --> 06:29.014
<i>But if we fail to secure this valuable
resource for the American people,</i>

06:29.681 --> 06:33.936
<i>it'll not only be a black mark
on my administration, but on this country.</i>

06:33.936 --> 06:36.563
I assure you, Mr. President,
we are doing everything we can

06:36.563 --> 06:38.273
to bring this one home for all of us.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.609
<i>Good. I have faith in you, Eli.</i>

06:40.609 --> 06:43.987
<i>Especially with how you handled
the Zakharova situation this past spring.</i>

06:44.655 --> 06:47.699
<i>I'll let you and Ron hash out the details.
Keep me posted.</i>

06:50.536 --> 06:51.537
Ron, I think you and I--

06:51.537 --> 06:54.122
So, how soon can we announce the plan
to harness the asteroid?

06:55.499 --> 06:58.001
- I'm sorry?
- I don't need to remind you that

06:58.001 --> 07:00.212
the president is headed
for a tough reelection battle.

07:00.212 --> 07:04.007
And the more the American people know
about what Goldilocks will do for them,

07:04.007 --> 07:05.551
the better his standing will get.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.804
Well, I hear you, Ron. I do.
But we have to be very delicate here.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.806
I'm already drowning in calls

07:10.806 --> 07:13.976
from the other M-7 nations
wanting a bigger piece of this pie.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.769
Not to mention,
the Soviets feel threatened

07:15.769 --> 07:18.522
because iridium happens to be
one of their biggest exports.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.274
We're on the same page here, Eli.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.651
The last thing we want to do is
antagonize our partners.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.989
Good. Because the only way we're gonna
get this thing is if we all work together.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.615
This can't be seen as just an American--

07:28.615 --> 07:31.577
You just focus on getting Mars
whatever it needs to get that asteroid.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.661
We'll handle the rest.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.879
Goldilocks is heading toward us
and hauling ass.

07:41.879 --> 07:46.925
So, we need to design and launch this
capture mission inside the next ten weeks,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.594
or else she gets away.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.929
That means pedal to the metal
for everybody.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.765
And all personal matters are gonna have
to take a back seat.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.353
Dimitri, how many more wranglers do you
think you'll need to corral this thing?

07:58.353 --> 08:02.858
Still waiting on protocols,
but at least ten more.

08:02.858 --> 08:07.571
Gonna have to ramp up microgravity
certification for many of my people.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.864
All right.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.867
If we're to have a hope in hell of
pulling this off, I strongly suggest that

08:11.867 --> 08:16.079
we curtail all but essential operations
and start stockpiling argon.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.874
Are you suggesting that
we slow down training operations?

08:18.874 --> 08:20.042
Well, absolutely.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.003
Rushing around
with our hands flapping in the breeze,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.464
hoping we can wing it,
is not going to get this done.

08:25.464 --> 08:29.343
Well, rushing around with our hands
flapping wasn't what I was proposing, Ed.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.720
Well, it sure sounded like it to me.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.108
- Can I speak with you for a minute?
- Well, of course.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.872
Let's just get one thing straight.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.208
That attitude of yours,
it ain't gonna fly.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.336
What, I'm supposed to rubber-stamp
any harebrained idea of yours

09:04.336 --> 09:05.796
that washes over the transom?

09:05.796 --> 09:08.507
This is not about harebrained ideas, Ed.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.050
Then what is it about?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.097
Let's just get this out in the open.
All right?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.934
Ever since I sent Svetlana Zakharova
back Earthside,

09:18.934 --> 09:20.602
you've been fighting me tooth and nail.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.688
I say "left," you say "right."

09:22.688 --> 09:27.067
It has slowed operations on Happy Valley
to a crawl these past few months.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.318
You're my XO.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.904
We have got to be on the same page.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.366
Sending her back was a bad call.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.910
It hurt morale.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.204
It was my call to make.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.833
We don't have to see eye to eye on this
to get this thing done.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.419
But we need to get this thing done.

09:47.004 --> 09:52.301
This asteroid, Ed, it could
change everything for people back home.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.469
Isn't that why we're up here
in the first place?

09:56.138 --> 09:58.056
Look, I want to get this rock
as much as you do.

09:59.975 --> 10:00.976
Okay.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.938
Then let's cut the shit
and make this happen.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.704
I'll get this round.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.042
Four glasses, comrade.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.669
Excuse me, Miles.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.839
Can I put in order
for these cotton shirts?

10:30.839 --> 10:33.133
Other fabric, it give me rash.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.969
- Sure thing.
- <i>Grazie</i>, comrade.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.096
Thank you.

10:40.849 --> 10:44.061
Next time he calls me comrade,
I'm going to punch him in the face.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.396
Glass for you.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.565
I don't like him.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.276
He's not good enough for Samantha.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.991
Okay, Milosh. What is next on the list?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.036
All right, all right.
Let's get back to it.

11:01.036 --> 11:06.667
Okay, so, today's haul. I got
another order from Staley for Odor-Eaters.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.419
He will not shut up about this.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.507
And Lee keeps asking me
about updates on his wife.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.551
We should let him know
where we stand on that.

11:15.551 --> 11:18.053
So, where do we stand?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.764
Has your guy gotten the wife
out of North Korea?

11:21.431 --> 11:24.935
JAXA's next cargo launch to ISP is
in a couple of weeks.

11:24.935 --> 11:30.399
Unfortunately, we're not going to be able
to bring her up, after all.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.611
It's too risky, Milosh.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.198
Low profile. Remember?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.243
Okay, but you told him we were gonna
get it done. And I told him that too.

11:41.243 --> 11:45.122
- If he finds out that we were--
- Last thing we want is to anger him.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.876
Korean business has been very good to us.

11:48.876 --> 11:55.924
So, we must wait until right time
to say right thing.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.801
You mean lie to him?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.721
You worry too much, Milosh.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.725
Remember, Ilya knows best.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.354
The capture mission's
just the tip of the spear.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.232
They're gonna need us to make
hundreds of thousands of liters of fuel,

12:12.232 --> 12:13.317
replacement parts...

12:13.317 --> 12:15.235
We'll be mining that thing for decades.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.446
They're gonna have to build
Happy Valley out big time.

12:17.446 --> 12:18.530
Thousands more workers.

12:18.530 --> 12:22.326
Right, it's like gold rush. No?
Bonuses, overtime, hazard pay...

12:22.326 --> 12:24.912
Well, I heard that we're gonna be working
round the clock.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.999
Double shifts. Six, seven days.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.876
And I mean, they're asking us to do this

12:30.876 --> 12:33.086
in half of the time
of what we should have.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.173
Samantha's right. We must be careful.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.592
But it is also an amazing opportunity, no?

12:38.592 --> 12:41.386
Perhaps you will be assigned
to the <i>Ranger</i> crew again.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.388
Glass half full. That is how you say it?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.224
Something like that.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.018
To Goldilocks.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.813
<i>Eighty-four percent of voters
who own cell phones</i>

12:51.813 --> 12:57.819
<i>say they support a proposed state ban on
the use of handheld phones while driving.</i>

12:58.779 --> 13:01.281
Alex, we're leaving for school
in five minutes.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.658
Okay.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.244
Peanut butter jelly not proper lunch.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.746
Well, Alex loves it, so...

13:07.746 --> 13:11.625
<i>...central to the initial race to Mars,
is finally going himself.</i>

13:12.209 --> 13:13.877
<i>Dev Ayesa has announced</i>

13:13.877 --> 13:18.340
<i>he is finally making the journey
to the red planet later this month.</i>

13:18.340 --> 13:20.259
<i>Ayesa talked with reporters today...</i>

13:20.259 --> 13:22.803
- Shit.
- <i>...outside his Helios offices.</i>

13:23.428 --> 13:26.306
<i>I simply felt that as CEO of Helios,</i>

13:26.306 --> 13:28.892
<i>with everything unfolding
on Mars as it has,</i>

13:28.892 --> 13:31.103
<i>that I should take a more hands-on role
up there.</i>

13:41.071 --> 13:44.074
- What's going on?
- Guess you haven't heard the news?

13:46.493 --> 13:51.874
That might be something you wanna tell us
before announcing it to the whole world.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.293
It was a spontaneous decision.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.587
You going to Mars was
a spontaneous decision?

13:57.296 --> 13:59.214
- Yes.
- Dev, I know out there you can do

13:59.214 --> 14:01.425
whatever you want and
people kiss your ass regardless.

14:01.425 --> 14:04.678
But in here, in these offices,
we're actually trying to get shit done,

14:04.678 --> 14:06.930
- and you throwing this kind of curveball--
- I know.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.350
And you and your team have been killing it
developing the asteroid capture plan,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.311
but the real action is up there.

14:12.311 --> 14:15.731
And as leader of this company,
I got to go where I'm needed most.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.316
So, if you're up there,

14:17.316 --> 14:20.485
who's going to handle
all the M-7 negotiations for Goldilocks?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.989
No way. I'm an engineer, I'm not--

14:23.989 --> 14:27.117
Aleida, don't worry. You'll be great.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.286
Now, Kelly,
we need to talk about robotics.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.789
So, I guess the astrobiology program just
gets shunted aside.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.209
- Back burner yet again, right?
- On the contrary.

14:35.209 --> 14:36.376
I'm escalating the timeline.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.046
I want your team's personnel
and equipment with me when I go.

14:39.046 --> 14:43.509
Okay. The seekers can be ready,
but I doubt my expedition team will be.

14:43.509 --> 14:46.011
I was counting on another six weeks
to bring them up to speed.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.387
I have a fix for that.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.765
You come with us.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.267
What?

14:52.267 --> 14:54.061
You train your team en route.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.272
By the time we arrive, they'll be ready
to hit the ground running.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.441
Dev, I-I hear what you're saying,

14:59.441 --> 15:02.319
but I can't just drop everything
and go to Mars with you.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.403
Why not?

15:03.987 --> 15:05.197
I have a son.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.784
I-I'd have to leave him behind for what,
six months, a year. Maybe longer.

15:08.784 --> 15:11.787
You have spent 15 years
on the search for life.

15:12.621 --> 15:15.832
It would be a shame to drop the ball
when you're this close to the finish line.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.087
But it's up to you.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.717
Meanwhile, I got a few loose ends that
I need to tie up before I go,

15:25.717 --> 15:28.011
so I will be out of pocket
for a couple of days.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.765
A couple of days? But we're right in
the middle of revamping capture protocols.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.691
<i>Ranger. Happy Valley.</i>

15:40.691 --> 15:44.611
<i>Ed, I see that you made some changes
to the</i> Ranger-2 <i>crew list.</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:46.446
<i>You know that needs to be run by me first.</i>

15:46.989 --> 15:47.990
Come on, Danielle.

15:47.990 --> 15:52.119
You know as well as I do that the mission
commander customarily picks his own crew.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.329
This isn't NASA in the '70s, Ed.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.875
Ultimately, I'm responsible
for getting Goldilocks into Mars orbit.

15:57.875 --> 16:01.461
Affirmative. Now, what's the problem?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.630
<i>Disregard of protocol, for one.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:07.009
This should have been run past me
before being distributed, but let's just--

16:07.009 --> 16:09.136
Let's put that to the side, all right.

16:09.136 --> 16:13.182
This crew list, it's cherry-picked
based off of what metrics?

16:13.182 --> 16:15.642
Well, after
the commissioner's blame-game report

16:15.642 --> 16:18.020
about the Kronos clusterfuck came out,

16:18.020 --> 16:20.689
I thought it would be good
to shake things up here and there.

16:20.689 --> 16:26.111
<i>So, some crew members were replaced
and others were deemed mission essential.</i>

16:26.111 --> 16:28.655
- Like you as commander?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:28.655 --> 16:33.911
Experienced commander. Battle-tested.
It sounded like a goddamn winner to me.

16:33.911 --> 16:38.415
<i>But hell, if you wanna micromanage me like
this, we can start all over. No problem.</i>

16:39.625 --> 16:41.877
Negative, XO. Negative.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.545
Your crew stands.

16:44.171 --> 16:48.258
Just give me more of a heads-up next time.
Happy Valley out.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.261
Goddamn it.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.057
Switching back to manual
for attitude control checkout.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.559
<i>Copy that. We're go for RCS manual test.</i>

16:59.770 --> 17:01.313
Hold on that test for a minute.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.607
<i>Standing by,</i> Ranger.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.653
You okay, sir?

17:07.653 --> 17:08.737
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.531
Don't forget
to cross-check the reactor temps

17:11.531 --> 17:13.742
before we disembark for <i>Phoenix</i>,
all right?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.036
Aye, aye.

17:22.166 --> 17:26.213
You gotta go. You can't give this
opportunity up because you have a kid.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.634
- You think guys ever have to do that?
- Course not, but Alex is different.

17:30.634 --> 17:31.760
You know that.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.679
With his health issues and...

17:34.471 --> 17:37.182
- He just needs me here.
- He has his grandma.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.309
Yeah,
and she'd probably love it if I left,

17:39.309 --> 17:41.854
so she can take him back to Russia
the first chance she gets.

17:44.565 --> 17:49.570
I just couldn't live with myself if he
felt like I was abandoning him, you know.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.071
Hey.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.782
Kids are more resilient than you know.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.952
I just don't want him to end up hating me.

17:56.952 --> 17:59.288
He's going to hate you no matter what.
Believe me.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.373
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

18:01.373 --> 18:02.791
It's just what happens.

18:02.791 --> 18:05.586
You give them life,
you give them everything from yourself,

18:05.586 --> 18:07.504
and then they end up looking at you

18:07.504 --> 18:09.715
like you're the most vile human that
ever lived.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.385
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm sure that isn't easy.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.804
What goes around comes around.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.099
I really put my poor dad
through the wringer.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.519
Well, I'm sure
he'd be very proud of you now.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.939
Aleida Rosales, power broker.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.651
God. Oh, God, no.
It's gonna be a disaster. Just you watch.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.488
I don't know. I think you have it in you.

18:33.488 --> 18:37.868
Come on. Can you imagine me
sitting across from all those M-7 reps?

18:37.868 --> 18:39.953
Yes, I can.

18:41.330 --> 18:44.249
Look, I remember my mom
when she first bought this place.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.085
Okay, she'd never run a business
before in her life.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.546
I asked her if she was nervous. She said,

18:50.839 --> 18:53.717
"There are always a million reasons
not to do something.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.803
You have to find the reason to do it."

19:06.230 --> 19:09.274
<i>The American
Space Program is central to that.</i>

19:09.274 --> 19:11.777
<i>And during my time as your president,</i>

19:11.777 --> 19:18.617
<i>I took the initiative in discovering
this incredibly valuable asteroid, 2003LC.</i>

19:18.617 --> 19:23.080
<i>A discovery that will change our country
and our world for the better.</i>

19:23.080 --> 19:26.667
President Gore today appeared
to take personal responsibility

19:26.667 --> 19:29.795
for the discovery of asteroid 2003LC.

19:29.795 --> 19:32.381
The Kremlin has denounced Gore's
claim of personal responsibility

19:32.381 --> 19:34.675
for the asteroid discovery as an
outrageous attempt

19:34.675 --> 19:36.593
to take credit for a Soviet achievement.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.304
But here now,
other achievements claimed by Al Gore.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.975
Number ten, was first human being
to grow an opposable thumb.

19:44.142 --> 19:47.688
Number nine, while riding bicycle one day,
accidentally invented the orgasm.

19:47.688 --> 19:50.816
It looks like
the president has stepped in it again.

19:50.816 --> 19:53.986
Next he'll want to name the asteroid
"Tipper."

19:54.695 --> 19:58.156
My advice, Al,
leave the discoveries to the scientists

19:58.156 --> 20:01.994
and stick to doing what you do best,
ruining our economy.

20:02.661 --> 20:07.833
What the hell is he doing?
This is a dance, Ron. A delicate dance.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.043
<i>I don't control what the president says.
You know that.</i>

20:10.043 --> 20:12.087
Don't give me that shit.
It was a prepared speech.

20:12.087 --> 20:14.423
He was reading off a fucking teleprompter.

20:14.423 --> 20:15.883
He likes to improvise sometimes.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.011
This is going to destroy
all of the goodwill

20:19.011 --> 20:20.888
that we have built up with the Russians.

20:20.888 --> 20:24.057
And do you have any idea
of what the other M-7 nations are gonna--

20:24.057 --> 20:27.436
<i>Yeah, and none of it matters
if we lose to Bragg in '04.</i>

20:27.436 --> 20:29.980
- So that's what this is all about?
- <i>Of course it is.</i>

20:29.980 --> 20:33.275
<i>You and I both know that Bragg would be
a fucking nightmare for NASA.</i>

20:33.275 --> 20:36.361
<i>Not to mention the country.
So, let's get off our soapbox.</i>

20:41.825 --> 20:42.826
Fuck.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.916
Oh, shit.

20:50.584 --> 20:54.213
I don't see how <i>Ranger</i> is gonna
despin something as big as Goldilocks.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.256
The ion engines just don't generate
enough thrust.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.341
I hear ya.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.051
I hear ya.

20:59.635 --> 21:03.305
All right, people. Let's keep thinking
on this. In the meantime,

21:03.305 --> 21:06.975
I wanna see some hard data from
those 3D torque simulations by tomorrow.

21:07.518 --> 21:08.977
- Thanks, guys.
- All right. Thank you.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.537
- Palmer.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:27.037 --> 21:30.249
You gonna lurk round my door all day long,
or you gonna tell me what's on your mind?

21:33.460 --> 21:35.003
- Do you mind if I--
- Go ahead.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.133
Take a seat.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.016
What's on your mind?

21:50.102 --> 21:51.270
Well, I--

21:52.145 --> 21:54.690
First off, I just wanna say that

21:55.732 --> 21:56.817
Admiral Baldwin,

21:58.443 --> 22:00.779
he's basically a hero to me.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.617
I was seven when the Russkies beat us
to the Moon,

22:06.410 --> 22:10.247
and my dad and I, we saw
all those congressional hearings.

22:11.164 --> 22:14.751
When Admiral Baldwin took the blame
for losing the Moon,

22:16.545 --> 22:18.005
he was talking about honor.

22:19.798 --> 22:26.096
He was talking about taking responsibility
even when it's difficult.

22:31.602 --> 22:35.397
When we were out on <i>Ranger</i>,
I-- I saw something.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.775
And God's honest truth,
I wish I hadn't.

22:40.569 --> 22:41.653
But I did.

22:42.654 --> 22:46.450
And now I feel compelled to report it.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.535
Okay.

22:51.413 --> 22:56.877
Admiral Baldwin has a tremor
or something with his right hand.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.797
And I could tell he was trying to hide it.

23:02.341 --> 23:05.010
He had to halt a training exercise
because of it.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.808
Are you saying that
Ed is hiding a medical condition?

23:12.518 --> 23:14.978
That is what I suspect, Commander. Yes.

23:18.232 --> 23:20.776
That is a very serious accusation.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.111
I know it is.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.823
But I also know what I saw.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.701
I just thought you should know too.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.623
All right. That'll be all.

23:34.623 --> 23:35.707
Yeah.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.950
Now, make sure to ration this.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.621
It's gotta last you another four weeks.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.752
Danielle?

25:16.433 --> 25:17.935
Can I please come back?

25:19.520 --> 25:20.604
Please.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.815
I'll stay in my rack. I'll-I'll--

25:23.815 --> 25:25.025
I'm sorry.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.611
I know it's hard,

25:28.904 --> 25:30.405
but this is how it's gotta be.

25:31.657 --> 25:32.950
You know that.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.566
Help, Captain. They're shooting us.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.903
Abandon ship. We're going down.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.449
Help! I'm on fire.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.412
Hey, baby.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.831
Hi, Mommy. Do you wanna play with me?

26:20.831 --> 26:22.499
Sure, bud. In a little bit.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.294
I wanna talk to you about something first.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.506
You know how I'm going
to send my robots to Mars

26:29.506 --> 26:31.258
to look for
those little microbes up there?

26:31.258 --> 26:33.385
- In the lava tubes.
- That's right.

26:33.385 --> 26:38.640
Anyway, it-- it looks like
I might need to go with them.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.058
To Mars?

26:40.934 --> 26:43.437
But while I'm gone,
you'll stay here with grandma.

26:46.273 --> 26:47.524
Why can't I come?

26:49.943 --> 26:52.988
Well, for one, you're still in school,

26:53.739 --> 26:55.699
and space travel isn't
really for kids yet.

26:55.699 --> 26:58.869
But Zack's mom and dad took him
to this hotel place on the Moon

26:58.869 --> 27:00.204
when we were in second grade.

27:00.204 --> 27:03.290
Well, yes. But it only takes a day
to get to the Moon,

27:03.832 --> 27:06.168
and it takes much longer to get to Mars.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.922
How long will you be gone?

27:12.758 --> 27:13.800
About a year.

27:15.010 --> 27:17.221
I know it seems like a long time

27:18.347 --> 27:20.224
but it'll go by so quickly.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.142
You'll see.

27:22.142 --> 27:26.355
What if you decide to stay forever
like Poppy did?

27:26.355 --> 27:30.275
Aw, bud, I know this is hard
but I've been on work trips before.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.444
This one will just be a bit longer, okay?

27:34.947 --> 27:36.323
Alex, come back. I--

27:40.619 --> 27:41.828
Alex.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.041
It's okay. It's okay.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.589
It will all be okay, little one.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.426
It will all be okay.

28:10.858 --> 28:13.485
Hey. Aleida, right? Aleida?

28:13.485 --> 28:14.695
So nice to meet you.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.030
I'm Brandt. Government relations.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.491
And obviously, we're going to be
working pretty close together

28:19.491 --> 28:21.118
with everything that's been decided.

28:21.118 --> 28:24.496
So, we really need to finalize
which senators we're approaching

28:24.496 --> 28:28.625
to support our position with the M-7.
Have you looked at the dossiers?

28:30.002 --> 28:32.212
Yeah. Yes, I have.

28:33.213 --> 28:37.509
Still doing a bit more, you know--

28:38.719 --> 28:39.928
Mulling it over.

28:40.429 --> 28:43.348
Ins and outs.

28:43.348 --> 28:46.685
- You haven't looked at it yet.
- Have you talked to Dev at all about this?

28:46.685 --> 28:49.396
I feel like he might have an opinion.

28:50.230 --> 28:53.483
He told us we should just come to you.

28:53.483 --> 28:56.570
So, just take a look
at those dossiers, okay?

29:04.536 --> 29:09.917
<i>And this is the entryway
and this is the living room.</i>

29:10.584 --> 29:13.420
<i>You know, it's not the biggest
but it's got a fireplace.</i>

29:13.420 --> 29:19.301
<i>And there is the kitchen
with this little eat-in nook there.</i>

29:20.636 --> 29:21.970
<i>It's gonna be really nice</i>

29:21.970 --> 29:24.765
<i>cooking the girls' breakfast
in the morning before school.</i>

29:27.059 --> 29:28.268
<i>I'm gonna get you!</i>

29:30.062 --> 29:31.438
<i>And wait for the best part.</i>

29:33.607 --> 29:35.442
<i>This is Sarah's room,</i>

29:35.442 --> 29:38.779
- <i>and over there, that's Lily's room.</i>
- <i>And this is my room!</i>

29:39.363 --> 29:40.531
<i>No!</i>

29:41.698 --> 29:44.159
<i>And over there is our room.</i>

29:44.660 --> 29:47.246
<i>I mean, my room.</i>

29:48.413 --> 29:51.291
<i>But you know,
when you get back we'll talk.</i>

29:52.209 --> 29:53.210
<i>Anyway.</i>

29:55.128 --> 29:57.714
<i>We're just so excited, Miles.</i>

29:57.714 --> 29:59.883
<i>I-- I can't believe that</i>

30:00.801 --> 30:04.972
<i>we can finally
buy our own house thanks to you.</i>

30:05.764 --> 30:09.893
<i>Honestly, I-- I never thought that
we'd be able to do that.</i>

30:14.982 --> 30:17.401
<i>Okay. Gotta go. Bye.</i>

30:33.250 --> 30:34.251
You okay?

30:35.377 --> 30:38.130
Yeah. They-- They posted
the assignments for Goldilocks.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.550
Shit.
You didn't get on the <i>Ranger</i>, huh?

30:42.342 --> 30:43.802
Bastards, why don't they realize--

30:43.802 --> 30:45.971
No, no. I-- I did. I--

30:46.805 --> 30:49.099
I-- I got on. I am--

30:50.934 --> 30:52.102
I'm on the crew.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.272
Well, shit. That's great, isn't it?
I mean, that's what you wanted.

30:55.272 --> 30:56.565
Yeah, I know.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.903
I know. I've been banging my head
against the wall these past few months,

31:00.903 --> 31:03.197
trying to get back out there, and now I--

31:07.242 --> 31:10.162
Miles, you should've fucking seen us
out there.

31:10.162 --> 31:14.833
We-- All running up to that board,
looking for our names, you know.

31:14.833 --> 31:19.463
Praying we got a slot. Thinking that
we won the-- the fucking lottery.

31:20.464 --> 31:23.634
When-- When the truth is we are
powerless up here, Miles.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.178
That's what I keep telling you.

31:26.178 --> 31:28.180
Come in with me
on this red obsidian thing.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.306
It's not too late.

31:29.306 --> 31:31.183
People back home are paying anything

31:31.183 --> 31:34.102
to get a piece of Mars. That way
you're not putting your life on the line

31:34.102 --> 31:36.271
for people
who don't give a shit about you.

31:38.357 --> 31:40.901
No, I don't know.
I don't think I'm there yet.

31:40.901 --> 31:44.988
I've been wanting this my whole life,
you know? I can't just walk away from it.

31:47.783 --> 31:48.825
Yeah, I get it.

33:16.038 --> 33:18.248
- Looking for Malaika.
- She's right over there.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.333
Thank you.

33:24.213 --> 33:26.340
William, move the left side up.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.217
It needs to be straight.

33:29.843 --> 33:30.844
Higher.

33:35.682 --> 33:36.975
Well.

33:37.601 --> 33:40.604
My goodness. What a nice surprise.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.111
Come.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.075
God be praised.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.453
Let me look at you.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.715
Are you hungry?

34:09.675 --> 34:10.926
No. I already ate.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.804
I came to say goodbye.

34:14.638 --> 34:15.681
Goodbye?

34:16.806 --> 34:17.975
I'm going to Mars.

34:21.562 --> 34:23.480
We're doing something important up there.

34:24.982 --> 34:27.568
We're building a new world
and it's a better world than this one.

34:27.568 --> 34:30.027
You know
you could try to change things here.

34:30.612 --> 34:32.697
You could make such a difference, Dev.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.616
When you come back, there is a community--

34:34.616 --> 34:36.076
I'm not coming back.

34:36.659 --> 34:37.661
What do you mean?

34:38.579 --> 34:39.830
I'm staying up there.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.543
You're still chasing your father's dream,
aren't you?

34:45.043 --> 34:46.587
I'm not doing this for him.

34:46.587 --> 34:52.509
That's what you tell yourself. But these
dreams of space destroyed your father.

34:52.509 --> 34:54.636
Space did not destroy him.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.097
You did.

34:59.725 --> 35:03.061
Everything that he did,
he did for his family.

35:03.729 --> 35:05.189
For our future.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.985
He never recovered after you left us.

35:09.985 --> 35:12.529
I never left you, my son. You know this.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.656
I was there. Don't you remember?

35:14.656 --> 35:17.910
Yes, I remember how I begged you
to come with me.

35:17.910 --> 35:21.914
And you wanted me to leave him
with no one at all? I could never do that.

35:21.914 --> 35:26.168
The truth is, he had already infected you
with his disease of ambition.

35:26.168 --> 35:28.545
Okay. God forbid
anybody have any ambition.

35:32.299 --> 35:36.178
Let's just agree that you and I will never
see eye to eye and part as friends.

35:36.178 --> 35:39.348
You're not my friend. You're my son.

35:40.516 --> 35:44.436
Stay here with me. With your people.
Don't turn your back on them.

35:44.937 --> 35:49.650
You can do so much good
for the young ones. They look up to you.

35:51.777 --> 35:53.487
<i>Harambee</i>, right?

35:53.487 --> 35:56.865
Everybody joining hands, working together
for the good of the whole. You know,

35:57.574 --> 35:59.076
of all the lies that you told me,

36:00.244 --> 36:01.828
that one was the cruelest one.

36:04.998 --> 36:08.168
But it's okay
because I see how people are now.

36:12.172 --> 36:14.758
If you need anything,

36:14.758 --> 36:15.968
just call this number.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.600
I don't want your money.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.270
I never wanted it.

36:27.187 --> 36:29.231
I just want my son.

36:35.070 --> 36:36.071
Goodbye, Mother.

36:49.793 --> 36:52.880
I understand how you feel and I apologize.

36:53.505 --> 36:55.674
The president just got
a little carried away, that's all.

36:55.674 --> 36:59.344
<i>He made a grave insult
to the honor of the Soviet Union.</i>

36:59.344 --> 37:01.597
I will issue a statement to clarify

37:01.597 --> 37:04.558
the Soviet Union's crucial role
in the discovery.

37:04.558 --> 37:07.019
<i>You must understand, Administrator Hobson,</i>

37:07.603 --> 37:11.398
President Korzhenko also faces
enormous political pressure.

37:12.441 --> 37:17.029
Members of the politburo are urging him
to go after the asteroid ourselves.

37:17.029 --> 37:20.908
Irina, you know as well as I do that
neither one of us have the capability

37:20.908 --> 37:22.784
to grab this rock on our own.

37:22.784 --> 37:25.996
<i>Are we really going
to let an amazing opportunity like this</i>

37:25.996 --> 37:29.082
<i>slip through our fingers
'cause of one little screwup?</i>

37:29.082 --> 37:34.880
I think the best course,
in the light of your president's behavior,

37:34.880 --> 37:36.590
is to negotiate a new agreement

37:36.590 --> 37:39.676
<i>that specifies
how we will divide up the asteroid.</i>

37:39.676 --> 37:43.138
What is the point of previous agreements
if we keep tearing them up?

37:43.138 --> 37:48.936
<i>It would mollify the hard-liners in our
politburo, as well as Dev Ayesa's Helios.</i>

37:49.561 --> 37:51.480
Well, I am not opposed to a summit

37:51.480 --> 37:53.982
but we would have
to include the other M-7 nations.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.400
Of course,

37:56.151 --> 38:00.447
and we will be more than happy
to host them here in Soviet Union.

38:03.534 --> 38:05.077
With all due respect, Irina,

38:05.744 --> 38:08.539
I think a neutral location would be
the most sensible

38:08.539 --> 38:10.749
in light of the nature of this conference.

38:12.209 --> 38:14.586
I need to give Korzhenko some sign
of your contrition

38:14.586 --> 38:16.755
if I am to lure him back to the table.

38:20.968 --> 38:22.302
<i>Administrator Hobson?</i>

38:26.807 --> 38:27.808
All right.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.102
I will talk to the president.

38:35.148 --> 38:37.192
Javi, come set the table.

38:48.328 --> 38:51.623
You know, you wouldn't even be alive
if we didn't do stuff like that.

38:51.623 --> 38:53.083
Please stop.

39:00.591 --> 39:01.592
Hello.

39:02.176 --> 39:05.262
<i>Hey, it's Brandt. The M-7 just announced
an emergency summit</i>

39:05.262 --> 39:07.931
<i>to hash out
how much everyone gets of this asteroid.</i>

39:08.599 --> 39:09.600
Okay.

39:10.309 --> 39:11.476
Thank you for the update.

39:11.476 --> 39:14.313
<i>It starts first thing next week, so...</i>

39:14.313 --> 39:16.148
- But--
- <i>...you better start preparing.</i>

39:17.482 --> 39:20.235
Dev will already be on his way
to Mars by then.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.863
<i>Yep. Pack warm.</i>

39:22.863 --> 39:24.448
<i>You're going to the Soviet Union.</i>

39:52.142 --> 39:54.102
Mommy loves you, Alex.

39:55.812 --> 39:56.980
Always.

40:39.314 --> 40:40.858
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

40:42.693 --> 40:44.236
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

40:46.363 --> 40:48.073
<i>I wish I could be there right now.</i>

40:49.867 --> 40:52.953
<i>I do. Not that-- Not that you need me.</i>

40:53.537 --> 40:59.793
<i>Because you are so strong,
and you got this, Kelly. You've got this.</i>

41:01.378 --> 41:03.589
<i>You're stronger than me.</i>

41:04.673 --> 41:07.217
<i>Stronger than all of us put together.</i>

41:07.968 --> 41:09.386
<i>You got this, okay?</i>

41:10.345 --> 41:13.432
<i>And you are gonna be the best mom.</i>

41:14.099 --> 41:15.517
<i>You are. I keep--</i>

41:16.268 --> 41:20.606
<i>I keep thinking
about how nurturing you've always been.</i>

41:21.815 --> 41:26.236
<i>From the day that your dad and I met you,
you've nurtured everybody around you.</i>

41:27.404 --> 41:28.614
<i>Even your dad and me.</i>

41:31.491 --> 41:33.410
<i>I can't wait to meet my little grandbaby.</i>

41:35.245 --> 41:36.246
<i>I may have--</i>

41:36.246 --> 41:40.584
<i>I may have already purchased the wallpaper
and the crib for the nursery.</i>

41:40.584 --> 41:44.296
No, I know but I can't help it.

41:47.174 --> 41:48.258
<i>I love you...</i>

41:50.135 --> 41:51.678
<i>with all my heart.</i>

42:18.330 --> 42:21.625
Show me the angular velocity estimates
for Asteroid 2003LC.

42:25.045 --> 42:26.296
That's what I thought.

42:28.507 --> 42:29.967
...goat rope.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.112
<i>We need your speech, babe.</i>

42:51.029 --> 42:54.324
<i>Zay won't admit it but he really wants you
to be a big part of the ceremony.</i>

42:55.033 --> 42:57.244
<i>You know, my mom blessed my marriage
to his mother</i>

42:57.244 --> 42:59.746
<i>and now he wants you to bless his.</i>

43:00.914 --> 43:02.666
<i>I know you got a lot on your mind
up there.</i>

43:02.666 --> 43:06.044
<i>All we're seeing on the news is
how important this thing is</i>

43:06.044 --> 43:08.088
<i>and how much y'all gotta do.</i>

43:08.797 --> 43:11.925
<i>But, you know, it's okay
to step out of things for a minute.</i>

43:11.925 --> 43:13.552
<i>Sometimes it helps.</i>

43:14.678 --> 43:16.597
<i>I know whatever
you come up with will be great.</i>

43:17.598 --> 43:18.599
<i>Love you.</i>

43:41.914 --> 43:43.498
<i>Courtney, Isaiah,</i>

43:44.499 --> 43:45.501
I...

43:46.627 --> 43:48.629
<i>I wish I could be there
with you all today.</i>

43:49.671 --> 43:51.715
<i>I am so happy for you.</i>

43:53.509 --> 43:57.262
<i>Marriage, partnerships... It's--</i>

44:00.641 --> 44:01.642
<i>It's...</i>

45:28.770 --> 45:31.607
After this, there's nothing left.

45:32.733 --> 45:34.026
I have to tell him.

45:39.239 --> 45:40.365
I'll come with you.

45:44.494 --> 45:45.495
Okay.

46:12.523 --> 46:13.524
Danny?

46:21.573 --> 46:22.574
Danny?

47:12.749 --> 47:13.750
Come in.

47:17.671 --> 47:19.047
Do you have a minute, Dev?

47:20.382 --> 47:21.675
Sure.

47:30.309 --> 47:32.394
I've given it a lot of thought, and...

47:34.605 --> 47:36.398
I want to go to Mars with you.

47:37.482 --> 47:41.987
Our work is incredibly important to me
and it's important that it's done right.

47:44.364 --> 47:45.490
But here's the thing...

47:47.868 --> 47:49.745
I want to bring my son with me.

47:51.455 --> 47:56.877
I know it sounds crazy with his health
issues and all, but just hear me out.

47:59.421 --> 48:01.798
I spoke to some of my former colleagues
at NASA,

48:01.798 --> 48:04.468
plus the flight surgeons here at Helios,
and they all agreed

48:04.468 --> 48:08.138
that Alex's cardiopulmonary
issues might actually improve on Mars.

48:09.097 --> 48:11.892
His weaker heart won't have to pump
as hard in one-third gravity,

48:11.892 --> 48:15.604
and the higher oxygen concentrations
inside the base will help offset

48:15.604 --> 48:17.189
his lower lung capacity.

48:18.273 --> 48:20.651
Yes, the month of travel
will be challenging,

48:22.027 --> 48:24.655
but space travel's become safe.

48:25.989 --> 48:26.990
Routine.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.495
Besides, what seven-year-old wouldn't
wanna be weightless for a few weeks?

48:33.830 --> 48:36.959
I'd tutor him in my free time
so he'd still get an education.

48:36.959 --> 48:39.503
He won't interfere
with the functionality of the base,

48:39.503 --> 48:42.548
and my dad will help look after him
as well.

48:45.592 --> 48:50.097
Dev, I am committed to doing my job
to the best of my ability...

48:52.432 --> 48:54.518
but I can't just abandon my son.

48:59.439 --> 49:00.691
I hope you understand.

49:04.528 --> 49:05.529
'Course I do,

49:07.239 --> 49:08.323
and he'll be welcome.

49:13.453 --> 49:14.454
Thank you.

49:40.022 --> 49:42.858
Milosh, how did we do today?

49:42.858 --> 49:46.069
Great. That new deodorant is flying
off the shelves.

49:46.069 --> 49:49.740
I think that loading dock supervisor
might be turning into a problem.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.783
Faiza thinks she's got a way around it,

49:51.783 --> 49:54.995
but that, as they say,
is tomorrow's problem.

49:55.913 --> 49:56.997
Yes. You're right.

49:56.997 --> 49:58.624
Tomorrow's problem.

50:04.421 --> 50:05.422
Pleasure.

50:06.215 --> 50:07.674
Don't you want to count it?

50:09.134 --> 50:10.886
That's all right. I'm sure it's right.

50:15.015 --> 50:16.183
Let us drink.

50:17.309 --> 50:18.560
To the success.

50:21.063 --> 50:22.940
And to you, Milosh.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.066
No.

50:27.236 --> 50:28.570
To us.

50:42.751 --> 50:43.752
Every time.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.441
What's this?

51:12.531 --> 51:13.574
Ed, I'm--

51:15.826 --> 51:18.412
I've thought long and hard about this,

51:19.913 --> 51:22.958
and I think it might be time for you
to take a step back from flight duty.

51:24.877 --> 51:26.086
Excuse me?

51:26.086 --> 51:29.298
Might be for the best.
You let somebody else command <i>Ranger</i>.

51:30.841 --> 51:31.884
Who, like you?

51:32.467 --> 51:34.803
No. It's not about that.

51:37.306 --> 51:39.308
I want you to let the doc
take a look at your hand.

51:40.767 --> 51:43.228
My hand. For what?

51:45.147 --> 51:46.440
You know what for.

51:53.113 --> 51:56.867
This is totally out of line, Danielle.

51:56.867 --> 51:59.411
I thought we were putting aside
our differences, but I guess

51:59.411 --> 52:01.246
that was just a load of bullshit.

52:01.246 --> 52:03.916
Ed, you have been commanding missions,

52:03.916 --> 52:08.295
flying missions, while concealing
a potentially serious health condition.

52:08.295 --> 52:10.714
All because what?
You just-- You just couldn't let go.

52:10.714 --> 52:14.343
I know my body. I know what works for it.
I'm fine.

52:14.343 --> 52:17.221
That is not your call to make
and you know that.

52:18.639 --> 52:21.850
You lied to me.
How am I supposed to trust you?

52:21.850 --> 52:24.269
Come on, Danielle.
You know I'd never put anyone in danger.

52:24.269 --> 52:26.104
I'm not so sure I do anymore.

52:26.897 --> 52:30.901
You should've gone home a long time ago.
Be with your daughter and your grandson.

52:32.694 --> 52:33.695
Is--

52:34.571 --> 52:36.448
Is that why you went home so quickly?

52:38.700 --> 52:39.952
Be with your family?

52:43.121 --> 52:45.999
Or maybe it was because
you're the one really running away.

52:47.376 --> 52:48.502
Watch yourself, Ed.

52:48.502 --> 52:49.586
Or what?

52:49.586 --> 52:51.755
You're already talking
about clipping my wings.

52:51.755 --> 52:52.965
What else is there?

52:52.965 --> 52:55.634
You gonna exile me
to that North Korean capsule?

52:58.262 --> 52:59.763
Give me a Bible to read?

53:00.806 --> 53:03.100
- Fuck you!
- There it is.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.393
Fuck you!

53:05.936 --> 53:09.439
I have been putting up with your shit
for the last 30 years!

53:09.940 --> 53:13.193
Watching you make wrong decision
after wrong decision,

53:13.193 --> 53:17.865
only thinking about yourself
like you're God's gift to the cosmos.

53:19.032 --> 53:21.702
Well, I have news for you, Ed Baldwin.

53:21.702 --> 53:25.873
You are just a pathetic old man
who doesn't know when to call it a day.

53:25.873 --> 53:28.917
Yeah. Well, unlike you,
I'm not a fucking quitter.

53:28.917 --> 53:33.338
No, Ed. And luckily, that is
not your concern anymore.

53:33.338 --> 53:34.423
You're done.

53:36.091 --> 53:37.342
What the hell you talking about?

53:38.093 --> 53:41.138
You are hereby removed from flight status

53:41.722 --> 53:44.683
and relieved of your duties
as XO on this base.

53:45.684 --> 53:46.977
Come on, Danielle.
