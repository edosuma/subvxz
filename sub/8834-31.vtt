Go!

01:27.250 --> 01:30.750
Hey, Cool Hands, this isn't bumper plane.

01:30.834 --> 01:35.166
Hey, anybody interested
in some fancy flight work?

01:36.709 --> 01:40.458
[Kit] Ooh, barrel out, backwards roll!

01:44.917 --> 01:48.542
You toss a mean spit wad, Baloo, uh,

01:48.625 --> 01:51.667
but when it comes to
flying the real thing,

01:51.750 --> 01:54.375
you might as well stay in the hanger.

01:54.458 --> 01:57.875
A pilot worth his rudder
works for the best people

01:57.959 --> 02:01.792
you work for a rookie, non-pilot female.

02:01.875 --> 02:04.458
Well, Rebecca's the brains
of the operation,

02:04.542 --> 02:07.542
she pilots the desk
while I pilot the plane.

02:07.625 --> 02:10.333
You've been piloting the pier all week.

02:10.417 --> 02:13.417
What's the matter? Sky too scary?

02:13.500 --> 02:17.834
Look, deadhead, we're waiting for
a really important client right now.

02:17.959 --> 02:19.709
Mr. Robert Service of--

02:19.792 --> 02:22.667
"At Your Service" delivery service?

02:23.625 --> 02:25.792
Good day, gentlemen.

02:26.333 --> 02:32.208
-Baloo, has our client arrived yet?
-Yours hasn't, but mine has.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.917
See here, Miss Cunningham,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.667
Cool Hands informed me that his company
is run by people with experience

02:38.750 --> 02:42.792
with, with pilot's licenses,
with sideburns.

02:42.875 --> 02:45.834
What's sideburns got to do
with hauling your coconuts to Cucamonga?

02:45.917 --> 02:49.417
The customer wants
the best man for the job,

02:49.500 --> 02:52.166
which includes you out, lady.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.083
Well, that's the third client
we've lost this week.

02:59.166 --> 03:02.458
It's the hogwash Cool Hands'
spreading about you

03:02.542 --> 03:03.709
that's putting them off.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.583
The better businessperson

03:09.667 --> 03:13.000
will always prevail and I'll prove it.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.125
Just as soon as I think of how.

03:16.208 --> 03:19.959
[upbeat music plays]

03:24.959 --> 03:28.583
So, that's what you do
with a washed-up cargo outfit.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.250
You start a conga.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.959
I don't see you up in
the wild blue yonder, cold feet.

03:34.041 --> 03:38.625
I took a break, so I could sign up
for the Great Air Scavenger Hunt.

03:38.709 --> 03:43.792
They ought to retire the title though,
I won it every year.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.250
Only because I haven't entered.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.041
[grunts]

03:52.041 --> 03:55.792
Oh, couldn't get permission
from the boss lady?

03:55.875 --> 03:57.542
'Fess up, Baloo.

03:57.625 --> 04:01.333
How're you able to fly with all
those apron strings in the way?

04:03.834 --> 04:08.417
Ooh, that's it! No more ribbing
about working for a girl.

04:08.500 --> 04:13.750
Come on. I'm gonna get that Cool Hands
right where it hurts, in the medals.

04:23.291 --> 04:28.083
So, you want to be in the
Great Air Scavenger Hunt, huh?

04:28.166 --> 04:30.709
Uh, that's the game plan.

04:32.875 --> 04:36.458
We give you clues and you figure 'em out

04:36.542 --> 04:38.959
and find the stuff we've hidden.

04:39.041 --> 04:42.208
First one back with the most items wins.

04:42.291 --> 04:43.959
Piece of cake.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.792
-Pilot?
-Only the best.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.250
-Aircraft?
-No problem.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.291
-Sponsor?
-Say what?

04:50.375 --> 04:54.375
Uh-oh. You need to sponsored
by one of the local aviation clubs.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.667
Contest starts at 3:00 sharp.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.875
Baloo, you need to find a sponsor.

04:59.959 --> 05:02.792
There's something even tougher
we have to do first.

05:02.875 --> 05:06.875
-What could be tougher?
-Getting the afternoon off from Rebecca.

05:08.959 --> 05:13.667
Uh, Becky, I mean, Rebecca,
I need to talk to you.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.834
And I need to talk to you.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.750
Baloo, would you mind
taking the afternoon off?

05:18.834 --> 05:22.750
Now, Rebecca, hear me out...
Did you say time off?

05:22.834 --> 05:26.750
I'm working on a really big idea
to drum up more business,

05:26.834 --> 05:29.500
and I need to shut the place
down for today.

05:29.583 --> 05:34.500
Oh, it's a sacrifice,
but if it's for the good of the company...

05:34.583 --> 05:36.375
It is. Trust me.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.917
Come on, kiddo. I did it.

05:44.959 --> 05:49.083
Kit, it's just you, me,
and the <i>Sea Duck. [gasps]</i>

05:49.166 --> 05:52.417
Baloo! The <i>Sea Duck</i>
wasn't part of the deal. I need it.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.750
-Need it? You can't even fly it.
-It's for the good of the business!

05:56.834 --> 06:01.000
All right, OK. Come on, Kit.

06:02.583 --> 06:06.208
She may know how to figure,
but I know how to fly.

06:06.291 --> 06:10.417
We'll just find us a club sponsor
with a plane that needs piloting.

06:12.834 --> 06:18.291
There's a race to run and I'm the bear
who can win it for your club.

06:18.375 --> 06:22.959
I'm Baloo, master of
the Baloo Barrelhouse Backwards Roll.

06:23.041 --> 06:28.417
Oh, yeah. I've heard about you.
You're the wash-up who works for a skirt.

06:29.291 --> 06:33.333
Ah, don't sweat it, little britches.
This isn't the only club in town.

06:38.542 --> 06:42.041
Oh, gosh, Baloo.
Just 'cause you work for a girl.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.750
[laughing]

06:44.834 --> 06:48.625
Hope you don't mind
that I put in a good word for you

06:48.709 --> 06:50.250
with the clubs here.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.959
Yeah, one club says yes
and you'll be eating my prop wash.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.917
[laughing]

06:56.000 --> 07:01.750
Oh, Baloo, you have found the one club
that may be dumb enough to sponsor you.

07:01.834 --> 07:05.792
The Daughters of Aviation. [laughs]

07:05.875 --> 07:08.000
The Daughters of Aviation?

07:08.083 --> 07:12.792
Correct-alutely.
You've gotta be a girl to join.

07:12.875 --> 07:16.625
You'll be perfect for them. [laughing]

07:20.458 --> 07:23.667
Time somebody unraveled him some.

07:23.750 --> 07:28.041
-I'm gonna enter that contest.
-But who's gonna sponsor you?

07:28.125 --> 07:32.750
[Baloo] Come on. I need you to make sure
my seams are straight.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.834
Awesome!

07:50.917 --> 07:56.125
Kit, say hello to...
[high voice] Tan Margaret.

07:57.542 --> 08:01.041
Hello, Tan Margaret.
I'm so grateful you turned up.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.917
Our top pilot couldn't find a babysitter.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.750
That's some grip you got there, Tan.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.125
It comes from doing a man's work all day.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.792
I hear that, sister.

08:14.875 --> 08:18.709
Ms. Margaret, incoming at 3:00.

08:18.792 --> 08:23.291
That Cool Hands is the biggest meany
I've ever met. Ah, just ignore him, Tan.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.417
That's exactly how I plan to play it.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.500
[chuckles] Oh, brother. Girls!

08:29.583 --> 08:34.917
Why not just save yourself the entry fee
and go buy yourself some silk stockings?

08:35.000 --> 08:35.833
[laughing]

08:35.917 --> 08:37.625
'Cause you're not gonna win this time,
big mouth.

08:37.708 --> 08:39.708
Not with me in the contest.

08:39.792 --> 08:43.750
What's the matter, lady?
Hurt you feelings?

08:43.833 --> 08:49.750
Well, go ahead. Take your best shot
if it'll make you feel better.

08:56.542 --> 09:00.542
Oh, wow! What a woman!

09:03.667 --> 09:07.333
I never met a woman like you
in my whole life.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.458
A real spitfire.

09:09.542 --> 09:11.375
[normal voice]
Hope to kiss a hippo, you haven't.

09:11.458 --> 09:15.000
You're the one I've been waiting for.

09:16.333 --> 09:21.792
Let me escort you to your craft,
my angel of all things wonderful.

09:22.667 --> 09:27.792
Which of these vehicles
will carve my heart into the sky?

09:27.875 --> 09:32.166
We managed to line up
a special plane to use for the contest.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.750
Think you can handle it, Tan?

09:33.834 --> 09:35.291
[Baloo's high voice] The <i>Sea Duck!</i>

09:35.375 --> 09:39.125
How'd you manage
to wrangle that, Mary, dear?

09:39.208 --> 09:42.959
That's Mary Lamb.
And an old friend did us a favor.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.959
Don't you need to start your engines?

09:48.542 --> 09:52.083
My dearest, I already have.

09:53.458 --> 09:54.959
Now, here are the clues.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.417
And say hello to your navigator,

09:57.500 --> 10:01.583
my old friend, Ms. Rebecca Cunningham.

10:01.667 --> 10:05.875
Hi, there. Whatta you say
we show these boys how to win a race?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.750
[crowd cheering]

10:34.667 --> 10:39.125
[sighs] After a takeoff like that,
they can start engraving

10:39.208 --> 10:41.041
our names on that trophy.

10:41.125 --> 10:44.834
I hope you're right, Tan,
my cargo company needs publicity.

10:44.917 --> 10:49.375
-That's why I'm here.
-I'm in this race to prove something, too.

10:49.458 --> 10:54.125
Exactly. And we'll be in last place
if we don't figure out these clues.

10:54.875 --> 11:00.333
"From this place we get the stuff
that makes the morning seem less rough."

11:00.417 --> 11:02.250
[Baloo's high voice]
Hmm, I can't think of anything

11:02.333 --> 11:04.250
that makes the mornings less rough.

11:04.333 --> 11:09.083
Fact is, I can't think until
I've had that morning cup of coffee.

11:09.417 --> 11:11.500
Coffee! That's it!

11:11.583 --> 11:13.792
And the best place to get coffee beans

11:13.875 --> 11:17.208
is on the little island of Crackyertora,
east of Java.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.208
That must be the first checkpoint.

11:20.291 --> 11:23.834
As soon as we land, we'll split up
and hunt for that contest item.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.500
Remember, think coffee.

11:26.375 --> 11:30.083
[normal voice] Think coffee.
How am I supposed to think at all?

11:30.166 --> 11:32.792
This girdle's cuttin' off
the blood to my brain.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.291
Whoa!

11:37.083 --> 11:38.709
[coughs]

11:38.792 --> 11:43.208
[Cool Hands] Let me help you... clam gums.

11:43.291 --> 11:47.166
What... [high voice] Cool Hands,
what are you doing here?

11:47.667 --> 11:52.417
I've been waiting here,
so we could have a few minutes alone.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.333
Hey, this is a contest.

11:54.417 --> 11:57.041
You'd better get going
if you don't want to lose this race.

11:57.125 --> 12:00.959
Oh, I won't lose. I got it all worked out.

12:01.041 --> 12:05.709
We'll tie this race
and then we'll tie the knot... together.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.625
[normal voice] Us? How?

12:09.208 --> 12:12.875
[high voice] I mean, how are you so sure
we'll tie the race?

12:12.959 --> 12:15.834
[grunts] I have a secret.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.875
[normal voice]
Brother, you're not the only one.

12:18.959 --> 12:23.458
I always steal the answers
and get to the clues first,

12:23.542 --> 12:26.458
but this time I waited for you.

12:26.542 --> 12:31.041
-[normal voice] You cheat!
-You catching a cold, love lungs?

12:31.125 --> 12:35.208
Now, listen up,
'cause I'm only gonna do this once.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.750
Tan Margaret, will you marry me?

12:38.834 --> 12:41.500
[high voice]
I-- I could never marry a cheater.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.875
You got one of them consciences,
don't you?

12:44.959 --> 12:48.542
Oh, I get the picture. I understand.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.166
You don't have to hit me over the head.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.583
Well, OK, if you want to.

12:54.667 --> 12:58.083
Tan, look what I found,
a coffee bean plant.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.000
We found the first item!

13:00.083 --> 13:02.333
I didn't have a chainsaw
to cut it down with,

13:02.417 --> 13:04.250
so I used my nail file.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.291
Come on, Rebecca, let's get out of here.

13:12.250 --> 13:16.583
No woman makes an idiot
out of Cool Hands Luke.

13:17.667 --> 13:20.792
[groans] I'll let them collect
all the clues for me,

13:20.875 --> 13:24.625
then show them who the best man really is.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.166
[Baloo's high voice]
So, what's the last clue?

13:30.250 --> 13:35.875
"Best be quick when you land upon
this place of timeless sand."

13:35.959 --> 13:39.000
Quick... sand...

13:39.083 --> 13:43.375
-Quicksand! Tan, that's it!
-Way to go, Becky!

13:43.458 --> 13:46.250
And I know the one beach
that's covered with the stuff,

13:46.333 --> 13:48.250
the Geraldo Riviera.

13:56.959 --> 14:00.083
The clue said "timeless sand."

14:00.166 --> 14:02.417
We have to get that watch.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.542
[ticking]

14:03.625 --> 14:06.667
[straining] I can't quite reach it.

14:06.750 --> 14:07.583
[sniffs]

14:07.667 --> 14:08.667
[gasps]

14:08.750 --> 14:11.208
I don't think your extra pair
of silk stockings

14:11.291 --> 14:13.875
are gonna make me any taller, Rebecca.

14:13.959 --> 14:18.500
But they will, Tan. You should be able
to scoop up the watch with them.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.125
[both] We did it! We did it!

14:28.250 --> 14:30.458
I did it. I did it.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.166
Let's go win us a contest.

14:42.166 --> 14:45.166
What are you looking for?
We got all the clues.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.834
I dropped one of my earrings in there.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.417
Well, we'll find it after we win.

14:55.917 --> 14:56.959
Hit it.

15:16.166 --> 15:20.709
[Baloo's high voice] Well, it's looks like
you're gonna get your publicity.

15:20.792 --> 15:24.333
Why, Tan Margaret, you have an admirer.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.208
Don't encourage him, Rebecca.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.458
So that you'll never forget me.

15:31.709 --> 15:35.959
-I wish I could.
-I think he has a crush on you.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.333
A crash, you mean!

15:40.792 --> 15:42.792
He's booby trapped my baby!

15:42.875 --> 15:45.875
We're gonna crash!

15:45.959 --> 15:47.583
[both yelling]

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
[both yelling]

15:57.959 --> 16:00.583
Look, Rebecca! Magnets!

16:02.125 --> 16:05.917
They've neutralized the controls!
I can't fly the plane!

16:23.917 --> 16:26.709
Rebecca, this is no time
for spring cleaning.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.083
Oh, yes it is.

16:32.625 --> 16:36.083
[Baloo's high voice] Rebecca, no! No!

16:46.625 --> 16:49.208
Tan, I did it!

16:49.291 --> 16:50.375
Oops!

16:50.458 --> 16:51.333
[grunts]

16:56.083 --> 17:00.000
Ooh, a superior business sense
can be dangerous.

17:11.959 --> 17:15.040
OK, how would they handle this
at business school?

17:15.333 --> 17:16.709
They'd fall.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.290
[yells]

17:18.375 --> 17:20.083
[normal voice] Rebecca!

17:24.375 --> 17:26.000
[yelling]

17:35.625 --> 17:39.208
That was the Baloo Barrelhouse
Backwards Roll.

17:39.291 --> 17:42.709
There's only one person I know
who could fly like that.

17:42.792 --> 17:46.041
-[high voice] Oh, really?
-And between you and me,

17:46.125 --> 17:49.667
I'm glad someone else's
as good a pilot as that lazy bum.

17:49.750 --> 17:52.417
Maybe a little competition

17:52.500 --> 17:56.041
is just what that bag of bones needs
to shake him up a bit.

17:56.125 --> 18:00.041
Competition, ha! Oh, my gosh, the contest!

18:00.125 --> 18:01.667
We have to hurry.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.750
Almost time to head over
to the finish line.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.375
Don't want to be too obvious.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.542
[plane approaching]

18:19.375 --> 18:22.333
Jumping gyroscopes!
But I saw them go down.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.709
No babe's gonna beat me.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.709
Sorry, Handsy.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.792
Ladies first.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.208
[crowd cheering]

19:02.166 --> 19:05.542
We did it! We won! We won!

19:05.625 --> 19:09.208
Congratulations. You two... Hey!

19:09.291 --> 19:15.083
Excuse me, Your Judgeness, but don't you
want to check their cargos first?

19:15.166 --> 19:18.500
Well, I'll be dipped.
You're absolutely right.

19:18.583 --> 19:23.375
-You did get the items, didn't you?
-Of course. Right here.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.667
[chuckles] Right where?

19:31.750 --> 19:34.250
But, Your Hopness, it was all right here.

19:34.333 --> 19:38.792
What a shame.
Well, guess that means it's my turn now.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.083
Right this way, judge.

19:41.166 --> 19:44.291
I'll just move my plane
into the winner's circle.

19:45.875 --> 19:49.125
I don't know how he did it,
but he stole our stuff.

19:49.208 --> 19:52.375
Don't worry. He won't get away with it.

19:53.542 --> 19:57.500
Those girls were no match for my wit.

19:57.583 --> 20:01.291
[Baloo's high voice] Didn't your mother
ever tell you cheaters never prosper?

20:01.375 --> 20:02.792
Uh-oh!

20:02.875 --> 20:04.709
[grunting]

20:14.583 --> 20:16.583
[crowd yelling]

20:21.250 --> 20:25.542
No, Tan! Stop, stop!

20:30.458 --> 20:34.500
I knew it. Yoo-hoo! Mr. Official!

20:34.583 --> 20:40.250
Over here. Cool Hands packed a surprise
for you in the cargo crate.

20:40.333 --> 20:44.834
Admit it, you're a cheat and a thief.

20:44.917 --> 20:49.166
N-- Never!
I won this race fair and square.

20:49.250 --> 20:50.583
Let him go, Tan.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.667
We're gonna win this contest like ladies,
with our brains.

20:54.750 --> 20:58.625
If Cool Hands claims
this stuff is all his,

20:58.709 --> 21:01.750
what's he doing with a woman's nail file?

21:01.834 --> 21:06.000
Oh, I didn't know
Cool Hands wore earrings.

21:06.083 --> 21:09.000
Or silk stockings.

21:09.083 --> 21:13.291
No, wait! I can explain.
I have varicose veins.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.208
I like gaudy jewels. [laughs]

21:15.291 --> 21:18.917
I was so excited to get my earring back

21:19.000 --> 21:22.166
that I didn't hear
what you were saying, Cool Hands.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.166
[gulps]

21:23.250 --> 21:26.583
You knew... you knew he'd be exposed.

21:26.667 --> 21:30.000
I knew we'd get him
when they pulled out those stockings.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.166
The earring was frosting on the cake.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.834
Well, I'll be,
you're the winners after all.

21:35.917 --> 21:38.834
Time for the awards ceremony.

21:38.917 --> 21:40.333
Lead the way.

21:40.417 --> 21:43.375
Uh, just give us a moment
to powder our noses.

21:43.458 --> 21:48.625
Rebecca, I just want to say thanks.
I learned a lot today.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.041
So did I... Baloo.

21:51.583 --> 21:55.667
[normal voice]
What? Oh, you knew all the time.

21:55.750 --> 22:00.709
Only a fool wouldn't recognize
her best friend, Baloo.

22:00.792 --> 22:02.959
Right on, sister.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.041
Right on.
