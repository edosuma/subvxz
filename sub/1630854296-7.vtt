00:05.839 --> 00:07.508
Previously on Fire Country...

00:07.608 --> 00:10.844
You work this program,
you'll learn to put out fires.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.346
And not just up there
in the mountains.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.514
You stole cars.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.948
I crashed one
with my sister in it.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.517
You're not the worst thing
you've ever done.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.918
GABRIELA:
What if we meet down the road?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.587
Where we met
when my car broke down.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.021
Where you told me
that crossing a line

00:21.122 --> 00:22.323
will get me in big trouble?

00:22.423 --> 00:24.992
I will stay
on my side of the line,

00:25.093 --> 00:26.494
if you do.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.629
I'm sick.
I have chronic kidney disease.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.364
Do you need a transplant?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.932
I need you to do good time.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.701
You should head back to work.
That's not happening.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.337
I'm your designated
care person.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.638
You were calling
to make me aware

00:37.738 --> 00:39.173
that you were calling
my girlfriend.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.908
Making sure that you know
that she and I are just friends.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.511
Bode, do you think
I'm worried about you?

00:43.611 --> 00:44.578
You and me
while you're with Jake.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.746
It's over the line.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.349
You don't want to see me at all?

00:48.449 --> 00:51.119
Somehow, a white shoe legal
eagle became my best inmate?

00:51.219 --> 00:53.954
Fire camp's like a vacation
compared to practicing law.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.189
Heard the women's captain say

00:55.289 --> 00:56.424
that one of her crew
is a lawyer.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.359
Rebecca.
Maybe she could
help you.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.361
Hey, Rebecca.
I'm Bode.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.596
My boy Freddy,
he's falsely accused.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.165
I'll take a look at his case.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.366
Thank you.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.768
See you around?
I hope so.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.504
* *

01:11.439 --> 01:12.606
BODE:
Good work, guys.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.808
Fire's about 20 chains out.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.944
(busy chatter)

01:21.249 --> 01:23.451
CHARLIE:
Is that smoke
or is that a person?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.253
We got something here!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.955
BODE:
Hey, Charlie,
what do you see?

01:28.055 --> 01:29.923
Hey. Hey, Charlie!

01:32.993 --> 01:34.662
Charlie.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.331
Charlie, get back
to the line.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.133
Charlie, we got to get...

01:42.170 --> 01:44.405
(muffled audio)

01:47.575 --> 01:49.810
(ears ringing)

01:53.747 --> 01:55.983
(muffled grunting, panting)

02:01.389 --> 02:02.723
(muffled gasps)

02:02.823 --> 02:04.592
MANNY:
Everyone all right?!

02:05.859 --> 02:07.027
Bode!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.662
Can you hear me?
Yeah.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.834
(audio clear):
What happened?

02:13.934 --> 02:15.068
Water heater.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.304
It blew out the front
of this house,

02:16.404 --> 02:17.671
unrelated to the fire.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.807
Damn, looks more like
a jewelry store.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.977
Wait. Oh, my gosh.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.680
I'm gonna need you guys to get
checked out by the EMT, okay?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.416
Yeah.
Get up, nice and slow.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.950
Charlie, I got you. Come on.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.585
There we go.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.953
KATE:
No, out!

02:33.053 --> 02:34.622
No, everyone, off the...
Ma'am, please stay back.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.890
No, I do not want these convicts
handling my stuff.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.426
MANNY:
Homeowner.

02:38.526 --> 02:42.029
Some people just can't get past
the damn orange jumpsuit.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.197
Ma'am!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.198
Excuse me.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.833
Hi. My name's Manny.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.035
Hey, you good?

02:48.135 --> 02:50.538
That was huge.
Hey, Rebecca. Yeah.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.273
You were so close.
Are you sure you're okay?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.541
Yeah, no, I-I'm fine.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.109
I'm all right.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.312
Okay.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.614
You know, I...

03:00.714 --> 03:03.351
I used to have a big house
and fancy stuff.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.118
Cared about it way too much.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.087
Kind of like
that lady.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.022
You miss it?
No.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.225
I'm learning to like
who I am without it.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.893
(chuckles)

03:12.993 --> 03:15.663
By the way, your friend Freddy
really did take a bum plea deal.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.131
You looked into his case?
Yeah.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.700
Is there any hope?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.436
I'll have to work some
jailhouse lawyer magic, but...

03:22.536 --> 03:24.638
I can be very persuasive.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.409
(chuckles):
Go get checked out.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.143
Yeah.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.781
(knocking)

03:34.582 --> 03:36.183
Hello, Vincent.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.751
Father Pascal.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.353
Oh, I'm just here
to pay

03:39.453 --> 03:41.922
the fire citations
from last month.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.924
(chuckles) Okay.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.059
You could've mailed them.
Well, yes,

03:46.159 --> 03:48.195
and you could've come
any Sunday and told me

03:48.296 --> 03:50.964
that my hedges were too close
to the power lines, so...

03:51.965 --> 03:53.100
May I?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.602
Thank you.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.006
You know, I can still
count on one hand

03:59.106 --> 04:01.642
the amount of times I've been
inside a church, right?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.611
Including my wedding.
Mm.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.613
So, do you have a pen?

04:06.414 --> 04:07.881
So I can write the check.
Oh, yes.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.016
Mm.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.886
* *

04:16.524 --> 04:17.524
(sighs)

04:17.625 --> 04:18.892
(phone ringing)

04:22.796 --> 04:24.965
(ringing stops)

04:27.134 --> 04:28.302
(clicking)

04:34.141 --> 04:35.175
(clicking)

04:38.712 --> 04:40.113
JAKE:
Hey.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.751
Been looking
all over for you.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.087
Are you... okay?

04:47.187 --> 04:50.424
I just got turned down
for three apartments

04:50.524 --> 04:52.993
because of my credit score.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.863
Okay, um...

04:56.664 --> 04:57.931
Well, babe, look,

04:58.031 --> 04:59.667
I have money saved up,
so how much are we talk...

04:59.767 --> 05:00.868
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.704
I can pay for
my bills.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.639
I have great credit.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.909
Okay, then
what's the matter?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.911
(groans)

05:11.011 --> 05:12.312
Gabs?

05:12.413 --> 05:14.181
My dad bought his first
house five years ago.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.183
He saved up forever
for that house.

05:16.283 --> 05:20.053
And right away, the pipes burst,
so I was happy to help.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.055
But that was
back then, and...

05:22.155 --> 05:24.057
I got my dad a credit
card a while back.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.595
Now there's a huge unpaid
balance on that card, so...

05:27.695 --> 05:29.763
I'm texting him...
(phone chimes)

05:29.863 --> 05:32.366
He says that he used it
by mistake

05:32.466 --> 05:34.034
and he'll clear it up.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.034
Okay, well, great.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.970
That settles that then, right?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.939
(sighs)

05:39.039 --> 05:40.674
LILLY:
Ha, there he is.

05:40.774 --> 05:44.612
Has my son gotten more handsome
since the last time I saw him?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.146
Mom.
(chuckles)

05:46.246 --> 05:48.015
Ah.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.282
Mom,

05:49.383 --> 05:51.419
I want you to meet...
Gabriela Perez, yes.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.286
Olympian turned public servant.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.287
I looked you up.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.823
Oh. (laughs)

05:55.923 --> 05:58.125
You know, my son's longest
relationship before you

05:58.225 --> 06:00.193
was firefighting.
(chuckles)

06:00.293 --> 06:03.163
Imagine my surprise
to hear you moving in together.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.364
It's so wonderful.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.269
That is

06:09.369 --> 06:10.538
a surprise.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.573
(alarm blaring)

06:12.673 --> 06:14.642
Okay, uh, we got a call.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.943
Um...

06:16.043 --> 06:17.210
We got to go, Mom.
Listen, I-I...

06:17.310 --> 06:19.012
I'm here for Sharon
on this trip,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.614
but next time, we are
roasting oysters on Hog Island.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.315
Nice to meet you,
Dr. Crawford.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.017
Ah-ah, Lilly.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.753
Who knows? Maybe one day
you might call me Mom.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.455
JAKE:
That's a respiratory
distress call.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.289
Should be quick.
Let's go.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.891
BODE:
Hey, do you know any tricks
to parole faster?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.659
Well, more fires get you
out faster, obviously.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.894
That's why
we're all here.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.663
But there are
other tricks.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.864
MANNY:
Let's mop this up.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.200
Educational credits,
good conduct.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.503
Though you strike me
more as a bad boy.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.572
Well, I'm trying
not to be.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.673
My mom,

06:45.773 --> 06:47.140
she's sick.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.043
Sorry.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.179
Got to follow the rules,
get out of here.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.014
How'd a mama's boy like you
end up here?

06:54.114 --> 06:55.683
Whole list of things
I didn't get caught for

06:55.783 --> 06:56.717
and one thing that I did.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.019
(chuckles)

07:03.924 --> 07:06.594
I'm here because job
stress drove me to drink,

07:06.694 --> 07:08.328
while driving.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.932
ClichÃ©, right?
Alcoholic lawyer?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.902
If you qualified
for fire camp, then...

07:15.002 --> 07:16.804
you must not have hurt anybody.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.171
Oh, no, no, no casualties.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.842
Other than a stop sign
and my marriage.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.711
And my license to practice,

07:23.811 --> 07:25.212
my parents' trust.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.179
Should I keep going

07:26.279 --> 07:28.949
or is this getting too sad?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.984
I can clean the rest
of these things myself.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.486
Ma'am, this grass
is still smoldering.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.888
There's soot; there's
all kinds of broken glass.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.690
No, I appreciate that.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.225
I just--
now that the fire's out,

07:38.325 --> 07:40.093
I would rather not
have my valuables

07:40.193 --> 07:42.262
being handled by criminals.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.936
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
back to your buggies!

07:49.036 --> 07:50.571
Give me everything
you collected first.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.372
MAN: Yes, Cap.
MAN 2: Got it.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.508
(chatter continues)

07:58.245 --> 08:00.280
* *

08:06.587 --> 08:07.988
Wow. A Lurvati.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.323
That's some serious bling.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.226
Huh.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.466
You know, as I was driving
over here, I was thinking:

08:19.567 --> 08:22.502
sometimes a bunch of
fire citations can be just that.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.572
And, uh, well, other times...

08:24.672 --> 08:25.573
No.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.541
This is not other times.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.809
You seem troubled.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.343
We could talk.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.078
California is burning, Father.
I'm always troubled.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.647
Oh, please, call me David.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.515
All right,
call me Vince.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.517
Vincent was my grandfather.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.352
(sighs)

08:39.452 --> 08:41.655
Well, Vince...

08:41.755 --> 08:43.289
here you go.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.128
You know, you're
a pillar of this community.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.963
People worry
about your family.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.531
I mean, how are you doing?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.970
Maybe we should crack
a beer sometime.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.606
I can listen.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.973
And you know what?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.976
I'll make sure the big guy
isn't invited.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.778
(whispers):
You're not invited.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.815
(both laughing)

09:07.915 --> 09:10.751
Um, thanks, David.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.254
That's very kind, but my dance
card's a little full these days.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.924
Well, you know
where you can find me.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.734
(door closes)

09:26.834 --> 09:27.901
Was that Father Pascal?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.871
My new buddy, apparently.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.505
What is going on here?

09:32.606 --> 09:35.008
What do-- Where are you going
all gussied up?

09:35.108 --> 09:38.311
Smokey's to meet Lilly.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.413
Oh. Good.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.316
Maybe she can give you
some medical insight, huh?

09:43.415 --> 09:44.517
I doubt it.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.886
I'm not telling her
that I'm sick.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.120
Come on.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.056
If I have
to fill up my days,

09:49.156 --> 09:52.059
I don't want them to all be
kidney conversations.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.894
All right, I get it.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.532
Have a good day at work.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.235
(door opens, closes)

10:02.335 --> 10:04.604
MANNY:
Well, can we spread
the late payments over time?

10:04.705 --> 10:08.175
GABRIELA:
We'll need
the first payment today.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.012
MANNY:
Hey, Bode.
What you need?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.581
Uh, your help.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.183
What's up?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.885
Look, I want to, uh, I want
to build education credits

10:17.985 --> 10:19.286
to try and parole faster,

10:19.386 --> 10:21.989
but the red tape
is daunting.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.156
That's great, Bode.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.725
That's how you
work the system.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.027
Listen, the application
process is a little slow,

10:27.127 --> 10:29.062
but I can help
fast-track that for you.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.630
I'd be more than happy to do it.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.565
(chuckles) Thanks, Cap.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.867
It's a great idea, man.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.069
Captain Perez?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.440
Hit the bunks, inmate.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.182
We got a problem.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.885
JAKE:
I'm sorry.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.553
Look, I told my mom
I was gonna ask you to move in.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.988
GABRIELA: I'm not
worried about that.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.523
I'm worried about my dad.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.358
JAKE:
If your dad said
he'll fix the credit card thing,

10:58.458 --> 11:00.460
then he'll fix
the credit card thing.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.461
I trust his word.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.730
I just don't know
how you fix

11:02.830 --> 11:04.698
a few grand plus interest
overnight.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.767
I'm worried.
Look, he's your dad.
It's his job to...

11:06.867 --> 11:07.768
ANDY:
Hey, over here.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.302
I'm Andy.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.438
I'm the one who called 911.
It's my coworker Wes.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.874
JAKE:
Hey. Hey, Wes.
Hey, hey, hey.

11:13.974 --> 11:14.942
I'm Jake, okay?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.543
Look, do you have asthma?

11:16.643 --> 11:18.011
(strained breathing)

11:18.111 --> 11:19.446
No? Are you allergic
to anything?

11:19.546 --> 11:23.183
It came...
It came out of nowhere.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.552
Okay, we're gonna need
the O2 and the PPM.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.820
Wes, don't try and talk.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.655
Andy, how long has
Wes been like this?

11:28.756 --> 11:29.656
ANDY:
He, uh...

11:29.757 --> 11:34.361
Inheritor. Inhaler. Bag.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.529
Bag. Square.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.331
(both grunting)

11:38.431 --> 11:41.168
Okay, there is an environmental
thing going on here.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.603
Jake?

11:44.437 --> 11:47.875
There's five more people down
around the corner.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.743
What the hell is happening?

11:49.843 --> 11:52.079
* *

12:03.891 --> 12:05.225
Greencrest Dispatch.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.827
We've got a suspected
carbon monoxide leak.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.228
We need backup now.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.997
Okay, we need to get
these people out of here.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.832
GABRIELA:
And alert the patrons
in the brewery, right?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.533
But first, we need to grab
our masks from the rig.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.235
(grunting)

12:16.203 --> 12:18.305
* *

12:22.342 --> 12:23.844
Yo, hey.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.712
Boys, something's
brewing.

12:25.813 --> 12:26.814
I think we're about to get

12:26.914 --> 12:29.016
rolled up on
by the new C.O.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.186
Everybody, up.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.055
Toes on the line.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.591
MANNY:
If you have
nothing to hide,

12:38.691 --> 12:40.227
you have nothing to worry about.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.838
(men murmuring)

12:50.938 --> 12:52.339
A little respect, man.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.040
Respect goes both ways, OG.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.023
DAVIDSON:
Cell phone.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.391
Vapes.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.360
Lonnegan, Ashford,
you're getting written up.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.461
That ain't mine, man!

13:14.561 --> 13:15.528
I didn't do that!
Hey, hey!

13:15.628 --> 13:16.729
Hey, hey!
(clamoring)

13:16.830 --> 13:17.998
Dude, it's not worth it.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.300
Come on, get off me.
(murmuring)

13:20.400 --> 13:22.135
INMATE:
What the hell?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.004
(pained grunt)

13:24.104 --> 13:25.605
Let's go.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.907
DAVIDSON:
He's right.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.675
It's not worth
going back to prison.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.177
But that's where
you're all headed

13:30.277 --> 13:32.245
if we don't get
to the bottom of this.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.746
We don't even know what
the hell you're talking about.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.082
A valuable item went missing

13:35.182 --> 13:37.117
from this morning's mop-up
on Maple.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.887
DAVIDSON: If no one comes
forward by end of day,

13:39.987 --> 13:42.923
I will personally ensure
that every one of you

13:43.023 --> 13:45.125
are sleeping in a cell tonight.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.128
Now, I'm gonna let you
talk amongst yourselves,

13:48.228 --> 13:51.731
figure out if that's how
you want this to go down.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.234
(siren wailing,
emergency horn honks)

13:54.334 --> 13:56.136
(urgent chatter)

13:56.236 --> 13:58.238
(grunting,
vehicle doors closing)

13:59.606 --> 14:01.674
FIREFIGHTER:
Give 'em a hand.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.310
Here we go.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.978
I got it.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.479
I got him.
(chatter continues)

14:06.579 --> 14:08.281
GABRIELA:
Wes.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.849
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.284
These firefighters are
gonna take you now, okay?

14:11.384 --> 14:12.685
I know you're scared,
but it's gonna be okay.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.054
Once you get more oxygen in you,

14:14.154 --> 14:16.189
you're gonna feel
much better, okay?

14:17.490 --> 14:18.992
How far out is triage?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.694
15 minutes. Help us.
Uh, grab your stuff.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.100
I have to check for gas,

14:27.200 --> 14:28.435
but it appears
to be a CO leak.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.536
Five victims inside.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.104
That we know of.
Could be more.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.805
All right, we'll do
an extensive search.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.175
I'd rather have a fire
than a CO leak any day.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.445
At least you can see flames.
CO's a sneaky bitch.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.214
What do you got
for potential sources, probie?

14:41.314 --> 14:44.384
Stoves, car engines,
water heaters,

14:44.484 --> 14:46.186
anything that needs fuel.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.222
We got to cut the gas line,
hope it cuts the leak.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.025
That should eliminate
most sources, I hope.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.293
On it.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.897
Are we worried that the gas
could lead to an explosion?

14:57.998 --> 15:01.368
CO's flammable but not
as flammable as natural gas.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.970
Just don't go lighting
any stogies in there.

15:03.070 --> 15:03.971
Anything that fuels fire,

15:04.071 --> 15:05.372
we kill that, too, right?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.174
That is correct, Perez.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.408
Guess what.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.743
You're with me.
Let's go do a sweep.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.081
Three friggin' weeks left
before I parole.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.983
Whoever took it
better cop to it.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.717
How do we know
you didn't take it, old man?

15:18.385 --> 15:19.652
(grunting)

15:19.752 --> 15:20.920
I may be old, son,

15:21.021 --> 15:22.455
but I'm crazy.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.491
Hey, hey, hey! Enough! No!

15:24.591 --> 15:28.528
Look, we've had each other's
backs the last couple months.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.830
Hell, we've even saved
each other's lives.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.499
Haven't we?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.402
We may have been criminals,
but that's not who we are now.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.870
No.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.039
We're firefighters.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.374
Despite what anybody says.
Yeah.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.278
That homeowner accusing us
of stealing things?

15:45.378 --> 15:48.481
This new C.O. trying to get us
to turn on each other?

15:48.581 --> 15:49.582
They don't define us.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.850
Hell no.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.785
We do.
MAN: Yeah.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.422
By our actions.
(murmurs of agreement)

15:55.522 --> 15:56.656
And by our words.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.491
Charlie,

15:58.591 --> 16:00.493
did you steal something
from the scene?

16:00.593 --> 16:01.761
I did not.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.796
I believe you.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.100
What about you, Perkins?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.101
No.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.536
No.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.439
Wayne? Brown?

16:12.539 --> 16:15.442
We stand together. Okay?

16:15.542 --> 16:20.080
Whether we're fighting fire
or we get thrown into one.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.881
(chatter, laughter)

16:21.981 --> 16:24.184
(country music playing quietly
over speakers)

16:24.284 --> 16:27.520
You know what?
I will have an iced tea, please.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.422
Um, same.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.557
Coming right up.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.292
Thanks.
(sighs)

16:32.392 --> 16:35.528
You just ordered an iced tea
instead of a rosÃ©.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.298
Who told you that I'm sick?

16:38.398 --> 16:41.168
Shouldn't the question be:
Why didn't you tell me?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.336
It's nonsense.
Sharon, who do you think

16:43.436 --> 16:45.272
that I'd call
if my house was on fire?

16:45.372 --> 16:46.706
Hopefully, 911.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.242
You're a cardiac surgeon.
This is my kidneys.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.911
Yes, well, I am also
a medical baller.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.281
You saw my TED Talk?

16:54.381 --> 16:57.284
No, you forwarded it
those three or five times,

16:57.384 --> 16:59.486
but I totally missed it.
(laughs)

16:59.586 --> 17:02.922
Well, then you know
how deep my connections run.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.291
Hospitals,
researchers, biotech.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.894
Access to all of it
from my L.A. office,

17:07.993 --> 17:10.930
which I am hoping
that you will join me.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.432
Oh, Bode's about to come home.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.102
I'm-I'm not taking off
while he's here.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.303
Okay.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.672
I-I need you to have
an open mind.

17:19.771 --> 17:20.772
Okay?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.376
And these...

17:23.476 --> 17:25.978
will help you with that.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.653
Shut up.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.522
(chuckles):
They're perfectly legal.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.157
We're both off the clock.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.660
So, not a pity party?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.295
(laughs softly)

17:42.395 --> 17:43.430
This a pot party?

17:43.530 --> 17:44.631
(laughs):
Yes.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.665
Really?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.267
(laughs)

17:47.367 --> 17:48.067
Thank you.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.702
You're welcome.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.704
Oh, Lord. Here we go. (laughs)

17:51.804 --> 17:53.506
(quiet chatter)

17:53.606 --> 17:55.074
(door opens)

17:57.344 --> 17:58.778
WOMAN:
Wait, is there a fire?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.113
WOMAN 2:
What's going on?

18:01.814 --> 18:03.550
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:07.019 --> 18:08.455
Hey, sir?

18:10.022 --> 18:11.591
My Imperial IPA sneaks up on ya.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.792
So does carbon monoxide.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.161
I don't smell anything.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.928
Yeah, you wouldn't.
It doesn't have a smell.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.198
(alarms beeping)

18:18.298 --> 18:20.200
There's carbon monoxide
leaking in here, too.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.735
Everybody, spread out.
Find every appliance there is.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.304
Shut everything down. Let's go.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.006
Ladies and gentlemen,
this brewery is now closed!

18:27.106 --> 18:29.342
I need everybody to evacuate!
Let's go!

18:29.442 --> 18:31.010
MAN:
Closed? What? Why? Hey.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.079
This is my lunch rush.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.082
Whoa.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.917
That's why.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.454
(grunting, gasping)

18:41.554 --> 18:42.789
(people screaming)

18:42.889 --> 18:44.624
Everybody, out! Now!

18:44.724 --> 18:47.860
CHARLIE:
This don't look like
no team-building exercise.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.962
Yeah, more like
team-breaking.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.599
Everyone, on your asses.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.067
Sitting on your hands.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.773
We're gonna question
each of you one by one

19:00.873 --> 19:02.409
until we get an answer.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.745
'Cause the way it's looking,
you're all going back to prison.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.280
Guilty until proven innocent?

19:07.380 --> 19:08.681
I'm sure the DOC
doesn't want

19:08.781 --> 19:10.850
a big ol' prisoner rights
lawsuit on their hands.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.151
Who's gonna file
that for you?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.086
Our very own
jailhouse lawyer.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.189
Rebecca Lee,

19:16.289 --> 19:18.558
dishonorable and disbarred
attorney-at-law.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.293
(murmuring, whooping)

19:20.393 --> 19:22.028
Look, we don't even know
what was stolen.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.863
A Lurvati watch.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.966
Taken from the house
you worked on.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.641
(urgent chatter)

19:34.741 --> 19:36.309
(coughing)

19:37.410 --> 19:39.178
Got him?

19:41.414 --> 19:43.015
We turned off
the rest of the gas,

19:43.115 --> 19:44.351
but they're still
dropping like flies.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.619
The CO source may not be
the main gas line.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.855
Finding it's gonna be
a pain in the ass.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.790
(man groaning)

19:50.890 --> 19:52.024
Hey. Hey, buddy,
what are you...

19:52.124 --> 19:53.493
(grunts)

19:59.499 --> 20:01.234
(siren whoops, urgent chatter)

20:01.334 --> 20:02.602
All this, this guy's priority.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.136
He's on the first ambulance
out of here.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.705
(groans)

20:07.540 --> 20:09.776
(siren wailing)

20:10.977 --> 20:12.078
CAB, probie?

20:12.178 --> 20:14.747
GABRIELA:
Compressions. Airway. Breathing.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.449
Come on.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.050
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.218
Hang in there, my man.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.458
Dispatch, can I get confirmation
on the secondary search?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.360
DISPATCHER:
We retrieved
three more patients.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.928
Copy you.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.102
Got a rhythm.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.604
Good, good.
Breathe, buddy, breathe.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.572
VINCE:
Good work.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.908
(labored breathing)

20:42.942 --> 20:43.976
Wes.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.980
Hey, hey. You just
breathed in poisonous gas.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.583
You need the oxygen
to recover, remember?
(mumbles)

20:50.683 --> 20:53.286
Wes? Wes Brooks?

20:53.386 --> 20:54.687
You know him?

20:54.787 --> 20:56.556
Yeah, we used to coach
Little League together.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.191
His kid was a power hitter
for Saint Mary's.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.327
I-I need...

21:00.427 --> 21:01.728
Yeah, you-you need oxygen.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.330
You just keep
breathing that in.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.333
We'll debate who should've won
the championship later.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.103
* *

21:12.171 --> 21:16.275
Are these way better or
is that the edibles kicking in?

21:16.376 --> 21:17.544
(whispers)

21:17.644 --> 21:19.512
(laughs)

21:19.612 --> 21:22.515
Good. So you're loosened up.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.584
Mmm.
(laughs) Yes.

21:24.684 --> 21:28.721
So, sitting on a transplant list
could take up to ten years,

21:28.821 --> 21:32.392
so we need to take action now
and not wait.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.761
(laughs):
You're a buzzkill.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.964
Um, I'm not even
transplant eligible.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.967
And then, you know,
if my numbers improve...

21:41.067 --> 21:43.503
When.
When your numbers go down,

21:43.603 --> 21:45.037
when you use my connections.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.075
Come on, let's get ice cream
and French fries.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.410
Sharon,

21:50.510 --> 21:52.011
I'm not letting you
go through this alone.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.514
I have Vince.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.082
Well, now you're
stuck with me, too.

21:56.182 --> 21:56.949
(laughs)

21:57.049 --> 21:58.951
With my edible dealer?

21:59.051 --> 22:01.754
(phone vibrating)
Thank you.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.290
Aw.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.692
Is everything okay?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.960
No. Bode's crew
is accused

22:08.060 --> 22:11.097
of stealing from a fire mop-up.
(gasps)

22:11.197 --> 22:13.666
There's a Lurvati watch missing

22:13.766 --> 22:17.236
from that, like,
gated community on Maple.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.838
Ugh.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.008
Oh, all those orange jumpsuits
on their fancy front lawns.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.343
They only saw
a group of criminals, trust.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.146
Okay. I'm gonna go up there.

22:27.246 --> 22:29.081
To do what?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.818
I'm gonna do whatever
to help my son.

22:31.918 --> 22:34.020
Um, uh, I'll replace the watch.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.089
Okay. We're gonna do this?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.125
Are you gonna come with me?

22:39.225 --> 22:42.462
I am not letting you roll up
on a bunchy of fancies. Mm-mm.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.663
On edibles.

22:43.763 --> 22:44.864
We can't drive.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.833
It's what my driver's for.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.636
(chuckles):
Your driver.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.771
You're fancy.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.774
I'm so glad we have you.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.676
(filtered breathing)

22:56.776 --> 22:58.678
So, Wes, how
you feeling?

22:58.778 --> 23:00.112
Better or worse than
when my kids beat yours?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.014
(gasping):
I don't know where...

23:02.114 --> 23:04.250
(mumbling indistinctly)

23:06.052 --> 23:08.988
(sighs) This is the
last of them, chief.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.222
All right, search is all clear?

23:10.322 --> 23:11.791
Yeah, secondary's
just finishing up.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.526
(siren wailing)

23:13.626 --> 23:14.527
Wait, wait,

23:14.627 --> 23:15.928
where did Wes go?

23:16.028 --> 23:17.864
He was confused and disoriented.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.098
Might've run back in.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.467
What the hell
is he thinking?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.201
He's not thinking.
He's got CO poisoning.

23:22.301 --> 23:23.836
All right, change out
your air cylinders, both of you.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.605
Go. Find him.

23:26.372 --> 23:29.742
Work doesn't stop
because one of you stole.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.844
Square this stuff away.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.345
(murmuring)

23:33.446 --> 23:34.481
Now.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.352
Hey. None of my girls
stole the watch.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.921
Your crew?

23:43.590 --> 23:44.857
There's no way. No.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.326
Well, if wasn't
any of us...

23:48.861 --> 23:51.130
Your cap did time
for stealing.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.601
Cars.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.569
Bode, do the math.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.170
Who was on the scene?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.540
He was the last one
to have the watch in his hands.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.774
I saw him.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.375
You can work your ass off
to get credits

24:03.476 --> 24:05.512
to shorten your time,
but nothing's gonna get you out

24:05.612 --> 24:08.014
faster than telling the truth.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.549
Snitching pays.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.117
I-I...

24:11.217 --> 24:14.721
I got faith that whoever
took the watch will fess up.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.188
Even Cap.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.757
Okay.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.993
Is your faith in him greater
than the love for your mom?

24:30.503 --> 24:32.739
* *

24:35.307 --> 24:38.277
JAKE:
Well, we turned the gas off
and vented the place,

24:38.377 --> 24:39.679
but the CO's still
through the roof.

24:39.779 --> 24:40.947
VINCE:
Then there's another source.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.348
I'll have utilities
cut the power

24:42.448 --> 24:44.917
for the entire block.
Okay, copy.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.554
(respirator whooshing)

24:47.654 --> 24:50.322
All right, we need to find Wes
and fast or cut bait,

24:50.422 --> 24:52.725
before it's either
one body bag or three.
(clattering)

24:52.825 --> 24:55.528
Wait, I hear
something. Wes?

24:58.264 --> 25:00.366
Wes?

25:01.634 --> 25:03.536
He's got a pulse.
Okay, I got him.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.504
Hey, Wes, come on, buddy.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.740
We're gonna go on
a little trip.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.776
(grunting)

25:09.876 --> 25:11.510
Let's go!

25:29.662 --> 25:31.898
Oh, hold on.
You look high as a kite.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.199
I do?
Yes.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.934
Okay, okay.

25:36.502 --> 25:38.204
That's much better.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.906
Thanks.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.042
SHARON:
Hello.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.845
Hi. I'm Sharon.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.379
Hi. Lilly.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.181
Kate. Can I help you?

25:49.281 --> 25:51.550
SHARON:
Oh, I'm so glad you asked,
'cause you can.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.152
You reported
a watch missing,

25:53.252 --> 25:55.955
and it has the power to send
a lot of people back to prison,

25:56.055 --> 25:58.090
and one of those people
is my son.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.493
Yes, sh-she is the mom
of one of the firefighters

26:01.594 --> 26:03.963
from this morning.
The convicts.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.866
They're incarcerated, trying
to turn their lives around,

26:06.966 --> 26:09.969
and the accusation that
you made could really hurt them.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.537
Accusation?

26:11.638 --> 26:14.073
When people steal from you,
do you not call the police?

26:14.173 --> 26:15.675
Oh, and how did you know
it was them?

26:15.775 --> 26:17.076
Did you have proof?

26:17.176 --> 26:19.078
LILLY:
Okay.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.579
Okay, we are not here

26:20.680 --> 26:22.248
to finger-point.

26:22.348 --> 26:23.916
Uh, we're here
with an offer.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.185
SHARON:
If you would
withdraw that accusation,

26:26.285 --> 26:27.820
I will replace the watch.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.555
I-I'll buy you another one.
It doesn't matter what it costs.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.658
I-I'm not rich,
but it doesn't matter.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.160
With all due respect,
I value people over stuff.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.528
Except it isn't "stuff."

26:36.629 --> 26:39.531
That's an heirloom that's been
in my family for generations.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.168
So, with all
due respect,

26:42.268 --> 26:44.070
please go.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.072
Thank you.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.212
You found him.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.947
Hey, great work, you two.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.048
How's Wes doing?

26:56.148 --> 26:57.283
(grunts) The water wall.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.685
It's a swimming pool.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.686
Hey.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.120
The water, the water.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.388
Yeah. You see?

27:02.488 --> 27:03.723
That's the lack
of oxygen talking.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.491
Yep, this guy's
on the next ambulance.

27:05.591 --> 27:07.459
He took in additional poison.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.795
Maxine.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.496
Maxine is inside.
GABRIELA:
Hey, hey, hey.

27:10.596 --> 27:11.798
Take it easy.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.733
Max-Maxine.
Relax, relax.

27:13.833 --> 27:14.934
(monitor alarms beeping)

27:15.034 --> 27:16.936
GABRIELA:
Whoa.
(grunting)

27:17.036 --> 27:18.838
(Gabriela gasps)

27:23.676 --> 27:25.778
GABRIELA:
What-what did he say?
"Inside"?

27:25.878 --> 27:27.113
Wait, who's Maxine?

27:27.213 --> 27:28.147
Maxine's his wife.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.615
And the swimming pool?

27:29.716 --> 27:31.250
W-Water wall?

27:33.820 --> 27:36.322
There was art on the wall
near where we found him.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.790
It was all water.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.158
Well, he's saying his wife
is still in there, okay?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.459
That didn't sound like
gibberish to me.

27:40.559 --> 27:41.961
Chief, we got everybody out.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.796
GABRIELA:
If it has something
to do with that wall,

27:43.896 --> 27:45.497
I don't know,
w-we go back inside, right?

27:45.597 --> 27:46.799
It's a risk, but...

27:46.899 --> 27:48.534
(monitor beeps)
I got a pulse.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.269
Hey, hey.
MAN:
Yeah, yeah.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.338
Yeah, we're coming.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.140
Chief, we listen to him, right?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.908
(sighs)

27:56.876 --> 27:58.544
Go. See if you can find her.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.212
I hope the hospital
can save Wes.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.381
Go, go, go, go.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.183
This is the last
of our cylinders.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.651
Yeah, I know.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.553
We'll make every
breath count.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.021
We should go, Sharon.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.290
Come on, there's got to be
something that I can do.

28:12.725 --> 28:13.960
Sometimes, the help
that's offered

28:14.060 --> 28:16.695
is not the help
that's wanted, is it?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.666
Right.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.302
Kate?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.972
Can I take one of those?

28:29.041 --> 28:31.310
You shouldn't have to
do this alone.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.645
* *

28:38.017 --> 28:39.451
BODE:
Don't give in yet.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.120
(chuckles)

28:41.220 --> 28:43.622
I've done enough time to know
when I'm running out of it.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.628
I'm one strike away.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.764
That bus is coming.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.665
I'm going back.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.673
(chuckles softly)

29:04.143 --> 29:07.814
I promised her I would be out
for her tenth birthday.

29:10.282 --> 29:14.620
But, hey, what's one more
broken promise?

29:19.258 --> 29:20.860
(sighs)

29:23.529 --> 29:25.264
You're not going back to prison.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.634
'Cause someone's gonna fess up.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.174
I'm gonna tell the C.O.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.844
Tell him what?

29:38.644 --> 29:40.947
I stole the watch.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.849
Bode.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.284
You didn't
take the watch.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.854
How would you know?

29:47.954 --> 29:50.022
Because I know you.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.424
I can think of
a much more plausible reason.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.263
What are you trying to say?

29:57.363 --> 30:00.032
I think if you've run
into some issues,

30:00.132 --> 30:02.068
this might seem like
a fast-track way to solve them.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.336
I would tread very carefully
if I were you.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.938
Look, the Cap
that I know,

30:06.038 --> 30:07.639
he wouldn't stand back
while his guys

30:07.739 --> 30:08.841
went down for something
that he did.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.177
I told you about my past...

30:12.044 --> 30:15.047
...so you would understand
that I wasn't judging you.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.218
Not so you could judge me.

30:19.986 --> 30:23.022
This isn't,
this isn't me judging you.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.224
There's still time
to do the right thing.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.126
(phone chirping)

30:34.766 --> 30:36.702
Watch has been found.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.671
What?

30:39.771 --> 30:41.974
Where?

30:45.411 --> 30:47.446
* *

30:53.953 --> 30:56.188
A wall of water.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.837
There's a door.

31:11.938 --> 31:14.873
* *

31:16.642 --> 31:18.244
It's hollow!

31:19.511 --> 31:21.413
(grunting)

31:27.719 --> 31:29.755
(labored breathing)

31:34.460 --> 31:35.995
(gas hissing)

31:36.929 --> 31:39.531
JAKE:
Looks like we found the source.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.603
I got a pulse.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.072
There were squatting.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.174
Probably didn't advertise it.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.109
Wes was the only one who
knew she was back here.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.677
And by the time
he knew how dangerous it was,

31:51.777 --> 31:53.112
he couldn't talk.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.480
She's been breathing this in
the whole time.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.847
Okay.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.350
(grunting)

32:00.152 --> 32:02.188
(labored breathing)

32:03.389 --> 32:05.924
(grunting)

32:08.727 --> 32:09.962
(gasping)

32:10.062 --> 32:11.130
I can't breathe.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.864
(coughing)
You're out of air?

32:18.870 --> 32:20.406
Just go.
I'm right behind you. (grunts)

32:20.506 --> 32:22.641
No.
Listen, that is
an order, probie.

32:22.741 --> 32:23.542
Go!

32:23.642 --> 32:24.543
What are you doing?

32:24.643 --> 32:26.512
We will buddy breathe.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.216
(panting)

32:30.316 --> 32:31.550
Hey, come on.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.719
(ragged breaths)

32:42.394 --> 32:43.962
We got this.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.100
Okay.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.435
All right.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.405
Together. (grunting)

32:53.505 --> 32:55.741
* *

33:01.047 --> 33:03.482
(siren wailing)

33:04.683 --> 33:05.451
Let's get her loaded
onto the rig.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.619
Come on. Let's go.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.923
(grunting)

33:19.698 --> 33:22.368
Wait, how did Wes turn out?

33:22.468 --> 33:24.703
He didn't make it.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.174
Died en route to the hospital.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.543
Perez,

33:31.643 --> 33:34.046
it's your first loss.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.647
It's okay to feel it.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.453
And it's back to work.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.459
(sirens wailing)

33:50.529 --> 33:52.598
All right, everyone, listen up.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.833
Hey, I'm Sharon Leone.

33:54.933 --> 33:58.304
If you don't know me,
this is my friend Kate Ricci.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.471
She has something to say.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.773
I owe you all
an apology.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.843
We found the watch
I was missing--

34:04.943 --> 34:07.246
Uh, she found the watch.
We found it working together.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.116
It was burnt.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.217
Unrecognizable.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.186
And I, uh...

34:14.286 --> 34:15.521
I made a mistake.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.056
All that and it was
a different watch.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.326
(quietly):
I don't care what watch it is.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.726
Doesn't mean we get to stay.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.762
KATE:
I'm just really sorry

34:23.862 --> 34:25.164
for all of the trouble
that it caused. I...

34:25.264 --> 34:29.168
It was an accusation
made on... prejudice.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.271
And, I, uh...

34:32.371 --> 34:34.606
I wish I could take it all back.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.043
I'm sorry.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.585
JAKE:
We did everything we could.

34:47.686 --> 34:51.623
You did everything
you could.

34:52.690 --> 34:56.228
So why does it feel like
he died because of me?

34:56.328 --> 34:58.063
Like I could've...

34:58.164 --> 35:00.065
put it together earlier.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.401
Because you didn't have
all the information.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.970
He couldn't speak.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.173
Look, he and Maxine,
they...

35:07.273 --> 35:10.942
they were stranded
on an island where...

35:11.042 --> 35:13.845
none of us could help them.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.681
Unless they let us in.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.349
People who need
the most help

35:17.449 --> 35:20.219
always feel like
they could handle it.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.990
My dad and I
used to crash a lot.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.828
At first, it was fun.

35:29.928 --> 35:34.200
He would throw
all of his money into...

35:34.300 --> 35:36.235
my training.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.171
Diving, tutors, tournaments.

35:39.271 --> 35:43.875
All while we crashed
at my tÃ­a's house.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.248
And then a friend's house.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.449
(sniffles)

35:50.549 --> 35:52.651
And then a motel.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.987
And then our car.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.728
It was only two months, but...

36:02.828 --> 36:04.696
it felt like forever.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.634
Baby, I had no idea.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.340
Hey, I-I am so, so sorry.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.677
It's just hard to talk
to people about it.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.113
They look at you differently.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.716
Like if you need charity.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.118
First of all,

36:27.219 --> 36:29.655
as we saw today...

36:30.922 --> 36:33.191
...there's nothing wrong
with needing help.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.301
As for you moving in with me...

36:44.035 --> 36:45.471
...it's not about that.

36:45.571 --> 36:46.472
I know.

36:46.572 --> 36:50.008
Well, up here, I know.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.912
But in here...

36:55.681 --> 36:59.184
...it's still really triggering
to talk about money.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.821
About moving in,

37:02.921 --> 37:04.690
I...
Hey. No.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.825
Look, you don't have
to talk about that now.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.296
But spend the night with me.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.063
If you want.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.301
I would love that.
Cool.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.970
(sighs deeply)

37:20.372 --> 37:22.341
(sighs)

37:22.441 --> 37:24.643
I'm open to help.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.413
I'm not moving to L.A., but
I'll talk to your specialist,

37:27.513 --> 37:29.581
and if she says
to come down for treatments,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.249
I'll fly down and do them.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.518
LILLY:
Uh-huh.

37:32.618 --> 37:36.121
And if the offer's
still on the table,

37:36.221 --> 37:39.558
I'll take you up on
the fancy dialysis machine.

37:39.658 --> 37:40.592
Yes!

37:40.692 --> 37:42.227
Am I still high or are you?

37:42.328 --> 37:43.261
You're doing this?

37:43.362 --> 37:44.930
Lilly.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.634
This is so much better
than doing it alone.

37:48.734 --> 37:49.735
Thanks.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.269
Love you, Sharon.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.071
Love you, too.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.675
(sighs)

37:58.844 --> 38:00.346
BODE:
Yo, Cap.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.318
I, uh...

38:07.819 --> 38:09.988
I don't know how to...

38:10.956 --> 38:12.824
I filled out
the application.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.426
An art course.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.362
Figured it'd be
easy credits for you.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.875
Thank you.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.310
You can thank me by keeping up
with your progress

38:32.411 --> 38:34.746
and getting yourself
the hell out of here.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.851
Why do you believe in me?

38:39.951 --> 38:43.355
'Cause I know what
it feels like to be doubted.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.995
Cap, I'm-I'm sorry, man.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.430
Aw.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.998
You were just trying to do
the right thing, Bode.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.366
I appreciate that.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.270
Uh, is everything okay, Cap?

39:00.706 --> 39:02.173
(chuckles)

39:02.273 --> 39:04.976
Yeah, man, it's more than okay.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.945
No one else is
going back to prison.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.246
My daughter's happy.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.247
She's solid,

39:09.347 --> 39:11.650
maybe moving in with her guy.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.486
So, that's something.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.154
Hmm.

39:22.494 --> 39:27.866
Watched a good man die
an ugly death today.

39:29.901 --> 39:35.106
Turns out, he was squatting
in the brewery he works at.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.343
(sighs heavily)

39:38.444 --> 39:39.745
(stammers)

39:39.845 --> 39:41.913
If we had known...

39:42.013 --> 39:44.550
I don't know,
maybe he wouldn't...

39:44.650 --> 39:46.284
he wouldn't be dead.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.458
Proverbs 16:18.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.927
"Pride comes before the fall."

39:56.962 --> 39:58.464
Yeah, pride.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.902
I'm just not sure how much more
of that I got left.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.237
You know, feel like I've been...

40:07.338 --> 40:11.209
Feel like I've been falling
for a long time.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.379
You must be tired.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.815
Yeah. Tired.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.284
Mostly pissed.

40:22.454 --> 40:25.457
Riley's dead.
Bode's incarcerated.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.525
Now Sharon's sick.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.260
She... might be dying.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.734
So, uh...

40:36.768 --> 40:39.370
I guess you know what
I'm supposed to say to that.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.438
Yeah.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.307
"God's got a plan
for everything."

40:42.407 --> 40:44.610
Right?

40:44.710 --> 40:46.277
Well, if that's true,

40:46.377 --> 40:49.414
all I'm saying is his plan
kind of sucks, don't you think?

40:52.551 --> 40:54.019
("Dirt Road Nights"
by The Cadillac Three playing)

40:54.119 --> 40:56.888
* Ooh *

40:56.988 --> 40:59.758
(lively chatter)

40:59.858 --> 41:02.594
* Ooh... *

41:03.962 --> 41:05.163
That's ten grand.

41:05.263 --> 41:06.798
I have bills to pay.

41:06.898 --> 41:10.435
* A little bit drunk
off the cup we mixed *

41:10.536 --> 41:12.704
* When you broke up with the boy
two counties over *

41:12.804 --> 41:13.905
* I'm glad you called me up... *

41:14.005 --> 41:16.107
Hit me.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.276

41:18.376 --> 41:21.980
* At our little
hometown bar... *

41:22.080 --> 41:25.050
19. House loses.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.719
Nicely done.
Yeah.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.187
Beginner's luck.

41:29.287 --> 41:30.689
MANNY:
Nah, I've had some luck here
back in the day.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.924
* Stop at the Quick Stop,
buy some more... *

41:33.024 --> 41:35.093
(crickets chirping)

41:40.632 --> 41:41.700
Hey.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.635
You guys are still here?

41:43.735 --> 41:45.103
C.O.'s handling paperwork.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.306
So I've got a whole
30 minutes left with you.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.912
You know that we're not
supposed to fraternize.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.216
I should...

41:58.316 --> 41:59.585
I should really
head into the bunks.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.386
I need to play it safe.

42:02.487 --> 42:05.356
Was... that why
you're out here?

42:05.456 --> 42:08.259
'Cause I thought
we could celebrate

42:08.359 --> 42:11.229
the finding
of the watch.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.900
I told you
that Cap didn't take it.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.367
You're loyal.

42:17.168 --> 42:18.770
That's sexy.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.106
* When it comes to her *
* When it comes to him... *

42:21.206 --> 42:24.109
Look, Rebecca, I'm...

42:24.209 --> 42:25.310
I'm flattered.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.245
But?

42:27.345 --> 42:29.480
I'm not the cap's daughter?

42:30.381 --> 42:32.217
That's different.
Yeah.

42:32.317 --> 42:35.086
She's out there,
and you're in here.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.988
* We just burn too fast,
so here we are *

42:37.088 --> 42:38.757
* Lighting up that spark *

42:38.857 --> 42:40.258
Let's escape.

42:40.358 --> 42:42.761
* We tried to run,
but we didn't get far *

42:42.861 --> 42:45.263
* I never say never with you *

42:45.363 --> 42:47.165
* I end up together with you *

42:47.265 --> 42:50.168
* It's hell and it's heaven
with you, baby *

42:50.268 --> 42:51.870
* Anything's possible *

42:51.970 --> 42:53.739
* The highs are unstoppable *

42:53.839 --> 42:55.974
* We're so uncontrollable *
(panting)

42:56.074 --> 42:57.743
* It's crazy *

42:57.843 --> 42:59.410
* We say we won't *

42:59.510 --> 43:01.880
* And then we do,
you're all I want *

43:01.980 --> 43:04.950
* I never say never with you. *
