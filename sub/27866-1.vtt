00:18.880 --> 00:20.917
<i>We interrupt our
regularly scheduled programming</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:23.475
<i>to bring you the following
report from NBC News.</i>

00:23.800 --> 00:25.280
<i>Here now is Tom Brokaw.</i>

00:26.280 --> 00:28.670
<i>Good evening
from Des Moines, Iowa, tonight.</i>

00:28.760 --> 00:32.070
<i>The Democratic caucuses in the
state of Iowa now are underway,</i>

00:32.159 --> 00:34.470
<i>and the first results
have just been reported.</i>

00:35.040 --> 00:36.633
<i>The NBC News projection</i>

00:36.720 --> 00:39.474
<i>is that Walter Mondale
will be the winner.</i>

00:39.960 --> 00:42.077
<i>About half of those
attending the caucuses tonight</i>

00:42.160 --> 00:44.277
<i>who expressed a preference
for a candidate</i>

00:44.360 --> 00:45.714
<i>are for Mondale.</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:48.675
<i>All the other candidates are far behind.</i>

00:48.760 --> 00:51.992
<i>It does appear, however,
that Senator John Glenn</i>

00:52.080 --> 00:53.594
<i>will not finish second.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:56.396
<i>And it appears that there's
a very good chance tonight</i>

00:56.480 --> 00:59.314
<i>that Gary Hart will be second
in the preferences</i>

00:59.400 --> 01:02.518
<i>of those attending
the Iowa caucuses tonight.</i>

01:02.600 --> 01:03.670
<i>Let some of the other...</i>

01:14.800 --> 01:15.950
His hair looks like shit.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.509
- When is he getting it cut?
- That is the new cut.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.199
We can't get a clear line.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.670
What? Are we at full stick?

01:23.560 --> 01:26.439
Jesus. Did you have to park
so close to the building?

01:27.680 --> 01:28.830
Okay, go, Steve!

01:29.320 --> 01:31.039
Yes, we learned just a few minutes ago

01:31.120 --> 01:33.715
that Senator Hart
will soon leave this hotel,

01:33.800 --> 01:36.952
head back to the convention hall,
where he will concede.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.670
Yes, he will concede to former
vice president Walter Mondale.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.200
Hart went into the primaries
a relative unknown,

01:45.760 --> 01:46.856
eclipsed by challengers
like John Glenn...

01:46.880 --> 01:48.473
I'm on my hands and knees,

01:49.440 --> 01:51.875
fiddling with these wires
behind the accelerator.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.430
I'm trying to get a...

01:56.160 --> 01:57.230
Congratulations.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.656
I'm fooling with the wires
behind the accelerator

02:00.680 --> 02:02.136
trying to jump-start
the damn thing, but...

02:02.160 --> 02:04.720
- You know how to do that?
- Well, golf carts are easy

02:04.800 --> 02:06.096
to jump-start, you got to get
the right wires together.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.430
Say he's been making phone calls
and thanking supporters

02:08.520 --> 02:12.150
and asking them to back
Walter Mondale's campaign.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.976
Okay, let's try another one. In three...

02:14.000 --> 02:15.760
Hey, asshole,
you're walking through my shot!

02:15.800 --> 02:17.473
- Yeah, sorry. Sorry.
- Come on!

02:17.560 --> 02:19.711
Hart won every state
west of the Mississippi

02:19.800 --> 02:21.917
in his fight
for the Democratic nomination,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.354
but in the end,

02:23.440 --> 02:27.559
it was a question taken
from a Wendy's advertisement

02:27.640 --> 02:30.360
that dogged his insurgent campaign.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.590
Roll tape. Go.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.176
<i>When... When I hear...
When I... When I hear...</i>

02:35.200 --> 02:36.616
<i>There are some specific ways to do that.</i>

02:36.640 --> 02:38.199
<i>When I hear your new ideas,</i>

02:38.280 --> 02:41.000
<i>I'm reminded of that ad,
"Where's the beef?"</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:42.480
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Okay, go, Steve.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.150
Hart will take to the stage

02:44.240 --> 02:45.616
- later this evening...
- Wait. Hold it, Steve. Hold it.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.296
- To share his thoughts...
- We lost the signal.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.640
Are we facing south?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.656
- I think we're facing south.
- Steve, would you shut up?

02:50.680 --> 02:52.080
We lost the signal again.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.911
Well, maybe you should invest
in a goddamn compass.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.336
Would someone tell... Steve, shut up!

02:56.360 --> 02:57.920
When he took the New Hampshire primary.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.176
- Okay, no one's listening to me.
- At that point, it was anyone's game.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.318
This news tonight
resets the playing field.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.313
Insiders of both camps
say the challenge now,

03:07.400 --> 03:10.279
heading into the fall campaign,
will be to unify

03:10.360 --> 03:12.511
this very divided Democratic Party.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.671
The long fight
between Mondale and Hart...

03:23.800 --> 03:25.120
What's the plan for after?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.271
The body's still warm.
You want to talk about '88?

03:27.360 --> 03:29.556
- I mean drinks.
- That Hawaiian place.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.835
Polynesian.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.656
I don't know what he was talking about,

03:33.680 --> 03:35.637
but he was in that...
Carter's White House...

03:36.040 --> 03:38.794
- So, can you use it?
- I lost all feeling above the knuckle.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.712
I could always tell
when it's about to rain.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.519
- No, really?
- Yeah.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.470
Yeah, okay.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.550
I appreciate it, Walter.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.793
I'll come with you back to Denver.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.149
You should stay.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.356
Senator, it's time.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.033
Remember to hit homelessness, sir.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.157
- I don't want you to fly alone.
- I'll be fine.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.994
I'll take the kids.
You need to be in D.C.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.800
- I don't need to be anywhere.
- Yeah, you do.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.678
Senator, we need to roll.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.399
Are you really gonna
follow Mondale around

04:19.440 --> 04:22.035
- for another six months?
- My apartment is grim.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.776
- I'll take the free meals, though.
- Maybe they'd like your job, Quinn.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.360
It's a good plan.
Well, it was a good plan.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.591
They light the damn thing
on fire, don't they?

04:30.960 --> 04:32.560
There's no weapons allowed at the table.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.796
The only shot I want's whiskey.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.958
- To the wisdom of the framers.
- Jefferson and his slaves.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.190
Leave Jefferson out of it.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.557
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Bob.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.816
Of course, they don't even
have a straw big enough

04:49.840 --> 04:52.071
- to reach down the bottom...
- You want a real drink?

04:52.160 --> 04:54.470
- You want a real drink?
- No, that is a real drink.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.030
<i>America is the land</i>

04:59.120 --> 05:03.000
<i>where dreams can come true
for all of us.</i>

05:08.680 --> 05:10.797
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the convention...</i>

05:11.400 --> 05:12.480
Thinking of going swimming?

05:12.560 --> 05:14.711
<i>My name is Geraldine Ferraro.</i>

05:18.360 --> 05:20.397
Remember our first trip
to New Hampshire?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.032
Come home in a Carter motorcade?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.440
And those two vans, you know,
that time we won the primary.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.318
Think Mondale's got a chance?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.357
Mondale? No. Reagan's gonna crush him.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.256
In four years, they won't
have an answer for us,

05:33.280 --> 05:35.317
- for our ideas.
- George Bush might.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.749
You think young people
are gonna vote for George Bush?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.399
If the economy keeps up.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.593
The world changes when young
people give a damn, Billy.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.416
We're the only ones
who'll give a damn about them.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.715
We should have won.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.993
That's not what this was about.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.995
Then what was it about?

06:04.040 --> 06:05.360
Now they know who we are.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.197
<i>- The circus.
- Jim, I would like to say,</i>

06:18.280 --> 06:20.749
<i>we do miss home,
and four months ago, we left,</i>

06:20.840 --> 06:22.399
<i>and I have not walked into my house,</i>

06:22.480 --> 06:25.040
<i>have not seen my puppies and my kittens
and all those things</i>

06:25.120 --> 06:27.077
<i>and our dear friends
that we love so much since.</i>

06:27.160 --> 06:29.117
<i>And so, to the people at home,
we love you,</i>

06:29.240 --> 06:30.720
<i>- we miss you and...
- Yes.</i>

06:31.080 --> 06:34.517
<i>And we hope all of the people
we love so much will forgive us.</i>

07:00.480 --> 07:02.136
- Give the president a little credit.
- No...

07:02.160 --> 07:03.992
One could argue
he's trying to keep us safe.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.390
No, President Reagan has
allowed our cities to decay,

07:06.480 --> 07:07.640
while he buys enough warheads

07:07.720 --> 07:09.598
to destroy this planet 30 times over.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.120
I mean, imagine if every school
could have a computer,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.656
every library, every home. That is...

07:14.680 --> 07:16.911
Well, why don't we just
buy everyone a microwave?

07:17.640 --> 07:19.279
And a television set, while we're at it.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.478
I'm interested in educating the next
generation, not entertaining them.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.870
You know, gentlemen,
this is beginning to sound

07:24.960 --> 07:26.394
something like a campaign debate.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.840
Mr. Billy Shore, what's the story?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.296
Do either of you
have anything to announce?

07:29.320 --> 07:30.456
It's not gonna happen today, Alan, okay?

07:30.480 --> 07:32.517
- After you, Senator.
- But keep asking.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.717
You and your younger
Democratic colleagues

07:34.800 --> 07:36.632
have been called the "Atari Democrats."

07:36.720 --> 07:38.313
I've heard. I didn't coin that.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.471
- Have you ever played Atari?
- Yes,

07:40.600 --> 07:42.910
I've tried <i>Asteroids</i>
a few times with my son.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.990
I mostly drifted around
getting pelted with rocks.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.438
Felt like my first term in the Senate.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.999
Did you see what Bono announced?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.753
He's running for mayor of Palm Springs.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.752
Oh, come on.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.591
I can certainly guess
his campaign slogan.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.478
"He's got you, babe."

07:59.560 --> 08:01.199
- He looks good.
- Yeah.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.656
- I've read your spy novel.
- Well, thank you.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.696
Hey, you guys be careful.
Let's put that inside right here.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.951
Now, these other candidates
are all decent guys.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.793
They all want what's best
for this country.

08:08.880 --> 08:09.996
But they're not gonna win.

08:10.080 --> 08:14.199
You know it, they know it.
More importantly, George Bush knows it.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.511
That's why they're all gunning for us.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.750
We lose this primary, that's it,

08:19.840 --> 08:21.718
we can kiss the White House good-bye.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.872
And kiss your future good-bye,
because...

08:23.960 --> 08:26.236
Will somebody pay the pizza guy?

08:28.160 --> 08:30.072
- How much is it?
- $17.99.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.720
If line three rings, don't pick up.
That's the fax.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.472
What if line one and two
are busy, though?

08:34.559 --> 08:35.960
Use line four.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.394
It's amazing.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.035
<i>We have a rusting industrial base.</i>

08:40.120 --> 08:41.634
How does he look that good?

08:41.720 --> 08:42.995
Genetics.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.992
Whose? Don Johnson's?

08:45.080 --> 08:46.799
Yeah. That's why I look like this.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.479
What if line four is busy?

08:48.840 --> 08:51.150
- Who the fuck did this?
- So, when you're exhausted

08:51.240 --> 08:53.232
and your feet hurt
and your fingers are frozen

08:53.320 --> 08:56.313
from knocking on doors in Nashua
for 12 hours straight,

08:56.760 --> 08:59.355
you miss your boyfriend,
your girlfriend, your

08:59.440 --> 09:00.590
kids...

09:02.400 --> 09:04.471
You're tired of eating fast food and

09:04.560 --> 09:07.280
leftovers because we
don't pay you jack shit...

09:08.280 --> 09:09.880
I want you to think
about the opportunity

09:09.920 --> 09:12.799
that we have right here, right now.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.716
And the cost to this great country

09:17.960 --> 09:19.679
if we squander it.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.915
Anyway, let's assume Cranston's out.
Who are we missing?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.719
Well, if Cranston doesn't know he's out,

09:28.800 --> 09:30.576
- somebody better tell him.
- Gore's looking at it.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.239
- What, Al Gore?
- Is he old enough?

09:32.320 --> 09:35.074
- He's 38, I think.
- His daddy could win him the South.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.356
- Have you seen the wife, Tipper?
- Thanks.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.432
- That's her name.
- There's Dukakis, maybe.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.160
- Who?
- The Governor of Massachusetts.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.960
"Dukakis"? That's not gonna
look good on a campaign poster.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.271
Yeah, add a "K," he could win the South.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.477
Gallup's got Hart beating Bush by 12.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.596
By 12?

09:50.680 --> 09:52.034
Jesus.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.713
Woodward, you know the guy.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.120
What do you think?

09:55.480 --> 09:57.836
Gary Hart? He could win it.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.400
I mean, he's got the hair.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.320
How many points
do you think the hair is worth?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.756
Six points. Four, if it's windy.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.834
<i>I think it's a little lofty</i>

10:06.960 --> 10:10.874
<i>for Senator Hart to be
discussing our grand future</i>

10:10.960 --> 10:12.376
without crediting President Reagan...

10:12.400 --> 10:13.720
Come on, I'm not gonna credit...

10:13.840 --> 10:15.080
...for the reforms we're seeing

10:15.120 --> 10:17.216
- in the Soviet Union.
- We did not bankrupt the Soviets.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.199
Communism bankrupted itself
morally and economically.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.272
You do not get credit
for kicking down a door

10:22.360 --> 10:23.760
- that's already open.
- Well...

10:24.920 --> 10:26.036
I mean...

10:27.040 --> 10:28.336
Ribbon-cutting at the end of the week

10:28.360 --> 10:30.636
and then a run-through
of the grand announcement

10:30.720 --> 10:34.509
6,000 feet above sea level at Red Rocks.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.638
Has anybody been able to get him
off this weird mountain man thing?

10:37.720 --> 10:40.360
- It's...
- No. He is entrenched.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.240
Technically, I don't think
he can be entrenched

10:43.320 --> 10:44.456
if he's on top of a mountain.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.552
- Okay, thanks, Doug.
- There is a long, storied history

10:47.640 --> 10:51.554
of announcing one's candidacy from
a drab, shit-colored ballroom with,

10:51.640 --> 10:53.996
you know, electricity and lights.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.355
And elevators.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.016
Has anybody told him
we can't drop balloons from a mountain?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.136
Maybe we could rent a plane.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.550
<i>...not just this quarter's bottom line.</i>

11:00.680 --> 11:03.115
We did not prep any of this.
He's just shooting from the hip.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
It's unbelievable.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.397
Yo, we're gonna
need water for the press.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.949
- Maybe oxygen, too.
- I moved here two weeks ago,

11:09.040 --> 11:10.536
I still can't find
a decent package store.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.153
Okay, maybe stop that, and focus on...

11:12.240 --> 11:13.816
She's not the one who gets
the coffee, by the way.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.416
- Downtime in Miami...
- You haven't found the one on Wynkoop?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.496
It's right around the corner.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.696
Doesn't it close at, like, 5:00?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.680
- Can we... Can we just focus?
- I'll put together

11:19.760 --> 11:21.576
some local party leaders
out of Fort Lauderdale.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.512
Yeah, no, we're not doing that.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.696
We're not getting endorsements?

11:24.720 --> 11:26.677
We're not filling up
a photo album with people

11:26.760 --> 11:28.558
who are gonna think
we owe them something.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.634
Anything else we're not doing?

11:31.720 --> 11:33.120
Yeah. No barbecues.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.080
- I love barbecues!
- Dix, the road

11:35.120 --> 11:37.157
to the presidency goes through
the Iowa State Fair.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.096
- What about the steak fry, Dix?
- Not this year.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.839
- The steak fry?
- Oh, my God, calm down

11:40.920 --> 11:42.832
about the barbecues. It's not happening.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.240
Okay, we're gonna talk about this.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.118
- No, we won't.
- Who's staffing Miami?

11:47.200 --> 11:48.395
Billy's there all weekend.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.195
- You're going to Miami?
- Billy B. Broadhurst, not...

11:51.280 --> 11:52.999
How about I get a down week in Miami?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.896
Jesus, there's a lot
of Billys around here, right?

11:54.920 --> 11:56.832
Well, I'm Bill, right?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.593
Only an 8-year-old
should be called Billy.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.354
So, I'm not sure if I'm supposed
to ask this question,

12:01.440 --> 12:04.274
but what exactly is Billy B.'s position
on this campaign?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.033
Well, he's a Louisiana lobbyist,

12:06.160 --> 12:09.073
so his chief contributions
to the political process

12:09.160 --> 12:11.072
seem to be gumbo and bourbon.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.674
And dirty jokes.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.355
- He makes the senator laugh, so...
- All right, going back.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.750
Last week in April,
we kick off and hit the road,

12:17.880 --> 12:19.678
starting with a grip-and-greet
in Kansas.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.995
Kansas is a go?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.037
Yeah, we think Kansas is a go.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.793
He'll actually talk about his parents?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.837
- No. He finds that irrelevant.
- Right.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.880
How? Everyone has parents.
It's relatable.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.077
So, what's relatable? That he was born?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.231
- Okay.
- It's not four years ago, though.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.880
He is up 12 points. People are
gonna want to get to know him.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.600
- Yeah, Dix.
- How do we get the senator to open up?

12:40.680 --> 12:42.717
We don't, okay? We just don't.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.840
I've never known a guy more talented
at untangling the bullshit of politics

12:46.920 --> 12:48.798
so that anyone can understand.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.837
It is a gift,

12:50.920 --> 12:53.480
and he wants to share that with people.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.195
And all anybody wants
is for him to take a stupid photo.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.272
He will never understand that.

13:01.720 --> 13:02.790
<i>The danger is this.</i>

13:02.880 --> 13:05.236
<i>Will America, in the year 2000,</i>

13:05.320 --> 13:08.279
<i>wake up to a future
as a second-rate power?</i>

13:08.360 --> 13:11.000
<i>This is the key test
of American leadership.</i>

13:11.360 --> 13:12.919
What about his marriage?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.719
I heard she looks the other way.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.200
Must be a limited field of view.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.680
Sounds pretty ideal to me.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.194
No, sounds like a zipper story.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.192
What is the candidate's position
on zippers?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.800
He prefers them open.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.560
Bob, you and he
were roommates for a while?

13:24.640 --> 13:26.376
Yeah, when Lee kicked him out
a few years ago,

13:26.400 --> 13:27.993
- he crashed on my couch.
- And?

13:28.080 --> 13:31.198
And anything that happens
on my sectional sofa is irrelevant.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.354
A.J. says the trail reporters
are obsessed with it.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.239
- Mr. Parker, is this so?
- No, just some stories circulating.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.356
Such as?

13:38.440 --> 13:40.352
Well, I heard one when I was in Dallas.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.796
Someone said they saw Hart go
into his hotel room

13:42.880 --> 13:44.951
with a blonde heiress
after a fundraiser.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.077
- Original.
- Well, when I was on trail,

13:47.160 --> 13:48.856
we fucked each other,
we didn't write about it.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.917
- Well, I'm married.
- Good luck with that.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.036
Should we follow up?

13:52.120 --> 13:53.696
You know how many members of Congress...

13:53.720 --> 13:55.871
We'd have to expel half the Senate.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.838
And you wouldn't be thrilled
with who was left.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.115
I'm not thrilled now.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.760
Why do they need
three hours to take a picture?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.320
It's the cover of <i>People.</i>
It's just what they do.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.631
And they want Gary and Lee, right?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.456
- That's right.
- They call me every single day.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.816
They're not the only ones, either.
I need to know what the plan is.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.274
As in?

14:15.720 --> 14:17.200
As in...

14:17.280 --> 14:19.920
I don't think that it would hurt us

14:20.920 --> 14:24.197
to put them both out there.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.016
Okay, okay, what are you talking about?

14:26.040 --> 14:27.315
The state of things.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.755
There's a ton of interest

14:30.840 --> 14:32.800
in the separations,
in the getting-back-togethers.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.032
It wouldn't hurt us to...
What? I think that...

14:36.120 --> 14:37.696
I think that people want
to get to know the Harts.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.280
I think that they want to see
them out, walking their dog,

14:40.400 --> 14:42.357
pumping their gas, being regular people.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.159
He's not a regular person...

14:44.240 --> 14:47.551
He's the next fucking president
of the United fucking States!

15:39.320 --> 15:40.879
Nope, it's not up for discussion.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.496
Your husband won't move off
announcing at Red Rocks.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.079
It's a powerful backdrop, Billy.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.376
You're gonna have to distribute
oxygen tanks to the press.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.869
Perhaps they'll conserve energy
by not asking questions.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.312
Billy wants us to pose
for <i>People</i> magazine.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.800
Millions of people read <i>People.</i>

15:52.880 --> 15:54.473
- It has words?
- Don't be fooled.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.280
- Gary loves <i>People.</i>
- That is slander.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.176
You should have told him
it was for <i>Popular Science.</i>

15:59.200 --> 16:00.350
- Hey, Andrea.
- Hey.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.816
You know, people want
to feel like they know you,

16:01.840 --> 16:03.672
and this is a good forum for that.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.071
Come on, if I do a photo shoot today,
what's tomorrow,

16:07.160 --> 16:09.356
swimsuit competition, talent show?

16:09.440 --> 16:10.440
Okay.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.830
Well, there will be photographers
in Kansas.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.559
Yeah, and I will be smiling like

16:14.640 --> 16:16.016
- some sort of game show host.
- I love drinking Robitussin

16:16.040 --> 16:17.190
to fall asleep every night.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.752
What do you think? This time next year,
you might be living at the White House.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.336
- Just think what my chores will be.
- Just think what your rent will be.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.671
- How are the applications coming?
- Utterly fascinating.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.233
This is really good.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.836
But I just don't think you need
the paragraph about the iguanas.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.256
It's kind of making light of everything
else you're saying about yourself.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.680
It says I have a sense of humor.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.399
Yeah, I don't think they care.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.120
So, Red Rocks?

16:47.680 --> 16:49.911
Yeah. I mean, if you're
gonna reframe the debate,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.320
you got to reframe the location.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.153
I know that. Dad, I really like it.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.676
Thanks.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.560
I'm still getting a hard time
about the road trip with Kate.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.790
Well, we're your parents.
We're supposed to, you know...

17:11.440 --> 17:14.000
Just stay on the main roads
and call us every night.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.954
It's Kate's dad.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.952
He doesn't like
that we're sharing a room.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.679
He's uncomfortable about it.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.914
One bed or two?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.438
Make an economics argument.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.554
Hotel rooms aren't cheap.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.273
It's a little bit farther.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.352
Seriously, was Everest not available?

17:51.440 --> 17:55.480
We should hit Enlightened Engagement
before the three E's, I think.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.074
You're calling it "the three E's"?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.117
Economy, education, environment.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.475
You forgot ethics.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.594
- Huh?
- So there's four "E's"?

18:02.680 --> 18:03.896
- Gary'll need some water.
- What's that?

18:03.920 --> 18:05.354
You're gonna need some water.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.551
- We'll have water, Mrs. Hart.
- And beer.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.996
The straight-down light's
gonna make brutal shadows.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.231
Mrs. Hart, you okay with the climb?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.510
Are you?

18:13.600 --> 18:16.069
No, it's gotta be
three "E's," linguistically.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.958
So we're losing an "E"? Which one?

18:18.040 --> 18:19.474
Environment, education or economy?

18:19.560 --> 18:21.696
- Which do you suggest?
- Add an "E." Who gives a fuck?

18:21.720 --> 18:23.074
Can we get some music?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.576
Like, a high school
marching band or something?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.319
- No band.
- No? Music is important.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.675
It sets a tone.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.513
What, are we opening a Stater Bros.?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.880
- Where's Bill?
- I'm right here.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.115
No, not you. Shore.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.919
He's Billy. I'm Bill.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
Hey.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.792
Senator, how would you react to a tent?

18:37.880 --> 18:39.872
- Lee.
- Poorly.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.713
Can we run this much cable?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.200
- We'll use a mult box.
- All right,

18:43.280 --> 18:46.159
- you'll be standing over here.
- Okay.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.232
With Andrea.
And I think you'll want to wear

18:48.320 --> 18:51.119
- something dark, maybe a blue.
- Dark? In nature?

18:51.200 --> 18:52.554
Yeah.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.976
I don't know,
I've already bought something.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.116
What'd you buy?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.429
Can we...

18:57.760 --> 18:59.640
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Can we just have a minute?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.416
- Have you talked to Andrea?
- Yeah. Remind me later.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.590
- Okay.
- Sorry.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.320
Really? Is this necessary?

19:04.400 --> 19:06.437
The Brown Palace has
a perfectly lovely ballroom.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.240
Dixon, Dixon, Dixon. You know
what brought me to Colorado originally?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.760
The railroad.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.912
I spent a summer hammering
railroad ties. Can you imagine?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.515
I actually can, yeah.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.720
You know the last time a Democratic
president came out of the West?

19:19.840 --> 19:21.354
- Never.
- Exactly.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.478
The West is the future.
Always has been. Still is.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.552
Yeah. Remind me later.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.993
<i>The announcement was originally
scheduled to begin exactly at noon,</i>

19:37.080 --> 19:40.152
<i>but now they say that Gary Hart
is going to be a few minutes late.</i>

19:40.280 --> 19:41.656
Senator Hart will be out any moment.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.296
- Please take a step back.
- He's gonna be going here.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.776
Everybody needs to be behind that line.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.536
What are you thinking?
I'm leaning towards the red.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.313
I feel like the red's
gonna pop for camera.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.256
- Why are you asking me?
- I'm not sure. Hey, Grace,

19:50.280 --> 19:52.736
I feel like the red. Let's get the red
ribbon up, please. Nice and taut.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.672
I'm just gonna make it go the other way.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.440
- You ready?
- Senator.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.920
- Okay. You all right?
- Sir?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.992
- Yes? Yes?
- Here you go.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.639
Wow. Couldn't find the big ones?

20:07.720 --> 20:10.599
<i>Gary Hart's been a United States senator
for 10 years.</i>

20:10.680 --> 20:13.070
<i>At 46,
he's one of the youngest candidates.</i>

20:13.240 --> 20:14.640
You've built up quite a lead.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.096
Do you already have your eyes
on the general election?

20:16.120 --> 20:17.296
You know what,
don't shoot the fucking desk.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.056
- We've got, like, policy papers and...
- Senator Hart...

20:19.080 --> 20:20.840
- Senator Hart is taking...
- Senator Hart...

20:21.040 --> 20:24.716
<i>The Democratic Party has been
in the dumps psychologically,</i>

20:24.800 --> 20:27.269
<i>and in disarray ideologically.</i>

20:27.360 --> 20:28.476
Bill Martin, Senator.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.880
- Bill.
- Really proud to be

20:29.960 --> 20:32.395
- here with you.
- Excited to have you on my team.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.696
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

20:33.720 --> 20:34.936
Joe Trippi, part of our press team.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.296
- Joe, how are you?
- Senator. Nice to meet you.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.879
- Senator, Ginny Terrazo.
- Hi, Ginny.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.394
- I'm sorry?
- Press team.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.816
- What was your name?
- Ginny Terzano.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.280
- Ginny. Yeah.
- These guys you know.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.436
- Gentlemen.
- Hi.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.976
- Hi, Billy. How are you?
- How are you?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.960
Hi, hi. This is Tom Fiedler
from the <i>Miami Herald.</i>

20:47.040 --> 20:48.918
Miami. Yes, I can tell by your tie.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.798
That's Miami, all right.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.031
Thank you. Really appreciate it.
Thank you.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.456
A small army
of reporters and photographers...

20:54.480 --> 20:56.073
At least 20 or 30 cameras

20:56.160 --> 20:57.576
- or 50 or 60 reporters.
- Three, two, one.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.435
<i>I intend, as I always have,
to run a campaign of ideas.</i>

21:02.000 --> 21:03.150
<i>Ideas have power.</i>

21:03.880 --> 21:05.792
Ideas are what governing is all about,

21:05.880 --> 21:09.078
and governing is what
this election is all about.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.398
<i>Standing before the snow-capped
Rocky Mountains in Colorado,</i>

21:12.480 --> 21:14.392
<i>Gary Hart announced for the presidency.</i>

21:14.480 --> 21:16.756
<i>Nowhere is Hart as much a front runner</i>

21:16.840 --> 21:20.834
<i>as he is in his own hometown,
Ottawa, Kansas.</i>

21:20.920 --> 21:22.513
<i>The former senator from Colorado</i>

21:22.600 --> 21:24.831
<i>arrived at the airport just
about an hour and a half ago.</i>

21:27.200 --> 21:28.520
Now, we're rolling here.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.470
In an era of great change,
challenge and opportunity,

21:36.560 --> 21:37.994
it's less important that our...

21:38.080 --> 21:40.470
So we flew to Ottawa fucking Kansas
to give a policy speech?

21:40.560 --> 21:41.896
I thought he was gonna get personal.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.673
Personal is not a comfort zone.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.037
If it's any consolation,
he is hitting all four of the "E's."

21:47.480 --> 21:48.994
We added an "E"?

21:50.720 --> 21:53.315
<i>Gary Hart, known as
the voice of a new generation,</i>

21:53.400 --> 21:55.960

21:56.040 --> 21:58.316
<i>who say this Colorado senator
has both the presence</i>

21:58.400 --> 22:00.073
<i>and idealism of a Kennedy.</i>

22:00.160 --> 22:01.913
Senator, how does it feel
to be back home?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.354
Well...

22:08.520 --> 22:10.637
Are we gonna swing
through the South or not?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.234
Why waste the money?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.391
- Carter won the South.
- Carter was the South.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.159
Trust me, it's already gone.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.976
Irene's right.
I'm not writing off the South.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.118
If my ideas make sense in Youngstown,
they'll make sense in Mobile.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.313
Then we get to go to Alabama.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.077
<i>Gary Hart prepares for another busy day

22:28.200 --> 22:31.671

22:32.160 --> 22:33.310
<i>Gary Hart's speech here</i>

22:33.400 --> 22:37.360
<i>was not simply about furthering
his own presidential ambitions.</i>

<i>Take two.</i>

<i>Gary Hart is back in the race

22:43.440 --> 22:46.990
<i>It was typical of what you might see
with the visit of a front runner.</i>

22:47.080 --> 22:49.595
<i>- Gary Hart's campaign circus...
- ...is in Fort Wayne tonight.</i>

22:49.720 --> 22:52.679
Why don't we invest in their enterprise,
in their industry,

22:52.760 --> 22:55.195
create opportunities
for Mexicans in Mexico.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.476
Instead of stealing your jobs,
they'll buy your chairs.

22:57.560 --> 22:58.789
They're not very good chairs.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.600
Can't really help you with that.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.096
Let's forget about jobs for a second.
Let's talk about security.

<i>Gary Hart is running far ahead

23:06.560 --> 23:08.677

23:43.800 --> 23:45.996
"I will trade you the car

23:46.080 --> 23:47.912
So I took that deal.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.480
I took that goddamn deal.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.758
- There it is there.
- Is it anybody I know?

23:52.840 --> 23:54.638
You know,
friends are for dinner parties,

23:54.720 --> 23:56.280
yachts are for new acquaintances, Hart.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.879
Quite a boat, Billy.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.997
Well, belongs to a man named Soffer.

24:00.080 --> 24:04.074
Good fella. Nice guy. Owns a shit-ton
of real estate around up in here.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.393
- Hi, B.B.
- Hey, darling. How are you?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.359
- I'm good.
- Told you it was a friendly crowd.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.079
- Hey.
- This is Gary.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.836
<i>Well, I'm taking my time

24:23.840 --> 24:26.480
- You're a senator?
- No, recently retired.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.074
<i>And I take what I find</i>

24:28.160 --> 24:30.675
<i>I don't want no more</i>

Oh, yeah.

<i>Yeah</i>

24:39.000 --> 24:41.515

24:57.600 --> 25:00.160
Donna? Right.

<i>I'm trying to forget your...</i>

25:41.120 --> 25:43.016
Okay, three, two, one.
This is Mike Ritchie reporting

25:43.040 --> 25:45.919
from Austin, Texas, where
Senator Gary Hart of Texas...

25:46.000 --> 25:47.960
Colorado. Fuck.
Let's take it from the top. Ready?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.536
- Okay, 30 minutes away.
- Three, two, one.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.816
This is Mike Ritchie reporting...

25:50.840 --> 25:52.240
Where's Sally?

25:52.360 --> 25:54.576
...Senator Gary Hart of Colorado
spent the day talking...

25:54.600 --> 25:56.717
- A designer suit?
- It's not about the suit.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.634
- It's the presentation of things.
- What's this?

25:59.720 --> 26:02.440
Ralph Lauren announced they're
doing wardrobe for CBS News.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.193
- John's not sure about that.
- What?

26:04.280 --> 26:06.416
- You preferred Hugo Boss?
- It's that word, "wardrobe."

26:06.440 --> 26:07.840
Like they're on <i>Three's Company.</i>

26:07.960 --> 26:10.919
- Well, it is a television show.
- No. It's the news.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.231
A bad suit should mean something,
it's trustworthy.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.515
Trustworthy?

26:14.600 --> 26:16.432
Yeah, look,
it starts with designer clothes,

26:16.520 --> 26:18.160
and everyone says,
"Don't they look nice,"

26:18.200 --> 26:20.376
and pretty soon Vidal Sassoon
is doing Tom Brokaw's hair.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.471
Right. Then they add
some pop music, right?

26:22.600 --> 26:23.716
- Yeah.
- Electric guitar?

26:23.800 --> 26:26.269
Sure, great. Mark Knopfler's writing
some opening theme song,

26:26.360 --> 26:30.832
and they'll have fucking action shots
of anchors leaping away from fires

26:30.920 --> 26:32.256
and pulling kittens out of storm drains.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.670
Hey, I'd watch that.
Dix, what do you think?

26:34.760 --> 26:35.989
I don't give a fuck.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.676
All right.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.632
You should give a fuck.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.791
It's the death nail of journalism.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.633
Do you mean "death knell"?

26:45.720 --> 26:47.313
It's a common mistake.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.472
How often do people
just punch you in the face?

26:53.640 --> 26:54.915
Hey. It's Gary.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.869
You were?

27:01.240 --> 27:02.879
I would love that. You know I would.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.436
Well, within the next 10 days.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.114
Miss you, too.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
Yeah.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.673
<i>Now boarding flight 435.</i>

27:18.840 --> 27:20.115
<i>Now boarding.</i>

27:22.920 --> 27:26.277
Another foolish call,
and everybody gets a secret.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.536
Can we swing him by the high school?

27:28.560 --> 27:30.199
- Unlikely. No.
- We can't do that.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.954
I think it's a good opportunity,
a photo op, whole family.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.475
If we keep him hopping around,
he's gonna get scratchy.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.438
- Yeah.
- Scratchy?

27:37.520 --> 27:41.514
Remember this time last year
we had that flat on our bus?

27:43.640 --> 27:44.840
- Here she comes.
- Here we go.

27:45.760 --> 27:49.674
I always assumed that he was born in '36
and two years after we were married,

27:49.760 --> 27:51.240
he had said '37...

27:51.320 --> 27:52.595
Sorry about that.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.352
- We're gonna get started.
- Yep. Who is it?

27:56.440 --> 27:58.360
It's Parker.
Yeah, he's from <i>The Washington Post.</i>

27:58.400 --> 28:00.232
- He's coming up right now.
- Parker?

28:00.320 --> 28:01.720
Yeah. Yeah, we'll bring him up.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.919
It's kind of going up.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.150
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.776
If you don't see it
kind of curving up like that...

28:06.800 --> 28:08.029
Hey.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.316
We have a few minutes right now,
if you're ready.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.113
Oh, yeah. Yeah, great. Thanks.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.873
- Sorry, sir. Thank you.
- Hey, guys.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.789
Go get him, tiger.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.758
So, second row up, in.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.160
- Kevin?
- Yeah?

28:22.240 --> 28:24.152
When can I get some face time
with the senator?

28:24.240 --> 28:25.776
We're gonna do a presser on the ground.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.314
No, no, I mean a one-on-one.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.554
We're not doing that this time.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.354
What do you call that?

28:33.320 --> 28:34.754
<i>The Washington Post.</i>

28:38.440 --> 28:40.159
- Please.
- Hey. Hi.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.840
There have been several
opportunities to negotiate,

28:42.920 --> 28:45.276
but it seems that the president
is not interested in that.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.296
Well, but you don't think
the president has gone far enough?

28:47.320 --> 28:48.536
I know he hasn't gone far enough.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.000
I know Gorbachev, too, don't forget.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.816
Well, what are we supposed to do,
aside from negotiate more reductions?

28:52.840 --> 28:54.136
Well, there won't be any peace dividend

28:54.160 --> 28:56.231
if we don't meet Gorbachev
more than halfway.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.198
I'd invite him to my inauguration.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.634
What? The Soviet premier?

28:59.720 --> 29:01.279
Sure. Yeah.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.874
Why wouldn't he come?

29:02.960 --> 29:06.078
Why wouldn't we show him
democracy in action?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.256
- I think we need to be bolder.
- Do you really think that'll

29:08.280 --> 29:10.158
lay the groundwork
for more negotiations?

29:10.240 --> 29:12.630
Groundwork?
The groundwork's already laid.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.399
It's just... It's just turbulence.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.235
Yeah.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.880
Hey, hey.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.840
It's just wind.

29:30.760 --> 29:31.876
Just close your eyes.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.035
Seriously.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.710
Okay, you're just

29:37.400 --> 29:39.198
driving down a country road.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.874
See? See? Yeah.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.236
We just hit... We hit a few bumps.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.993
The truck keeps going.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.672
You've been doing this your whole life.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.070
Okay? Some roads aren't paved,
that's all.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.796
Thank you.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.554
So, the Soviets are
in an economic tailspin,

30:08.640 --> 30:11.360
but that change has to be managed,

30:11.440 --> 30:13.656
otherwise, you'll get a power vacuum
in Asia and the Mideast,

30:13.680 --> 30:15.478
and you know what fills vacuums, right?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.199
- Human nature?
- Exactly.

30:17.600 --> 30:21.389
Wars, dictators, religious extremism.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.112
That's your view of human nature?

30:24.200 --> 30:26.192
Didn't they teach you Tolstoy at...

30:26.280 --> 30:28.511
Yale. And I was a history major.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.116
Right.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.280
Here.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.717
Teach you something about the Soviets.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.516
Thank you.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.515
I'll get it back to you.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.319
Keep it. I'm not a library.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.719
It is your job, specifically,

30:57.800 --> 31:01.111
to convince the senator not
to do things exactly like this.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.032
What exactly do you want me to say?

31:03.120 --> 31:04.554
He's gonna look like an idiot.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.200
- Or worse, kill someone.
- Roosevelt was an outdoorsman.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.634
He shot a grizzly once.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.376
You know that's
where teddy bears come from?

31:10.400 --> 31:11.720
- Fuck off.
- It's true.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.256
Teddy Roosevelt almost killed
a giant bear, and they commemorate it

31:14.280 --> 31:15.794
by making plush toys for children.

31:15.880 --> 31:16.936
It was a national sensation.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.235
Ten bucks says he misses?

31:18.320 --> 31:20.516
- I'm all right, thanks.
- I can't believe

31:20.600 --> 31:22.136
we're at a fucking axe-throwing contest.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.958
What do they call it, Timbersport?

31:24.040 --> 31:25.440
This is a first.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.512
He might just actually
throw away his campaign.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.080
I can't fucking watch this.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.719
That was incredible!

31:49.120 --> 31:50.634
Oh, my God!

31:51.000 --> 31:53.231
<i>It's a love thing</i>

31:59.440 --> 32:01.875
<i>It's a love thing</i>

32:01.960 --> 32:04.794
<i>It's a love</i>

32:06.640 --> 32:08.074
<i>Thing</i>

32:08.280 --> 32:10.397
<i>The look in your eyes</i>

32:10.480 --> 32:13.439
<i>Is more than enough
to make my poor heart...</i>

32:13.600 --> 32:14.750
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.115
Could you sign my diary?

32:16.200 --> 32:18.396
<i>Knew from the moment we met</i>

32:18.480 --> 32:20.199
<i>That there was no doubt</i>

32:20.280 --> 32:21.430
<i>That my life...</i>

32:21.520 --> 32:22.520
Hey, guys.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.718
- What's the news?
- Cuomo's officially out.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.758
Well, long way to go.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.271
Kennedy, Bradley... They're all out.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.599
I like Gephardt.
AI's still in this thing.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.273
Jesse Jackson.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.953
Come on, I mean, Senator, sir.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.474
What? He's got double digits.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.056
You think the people of this country
will elect Jesse Jackson as president?

32:45.080 --> 32:46.736
- Maybe vice president.
- Well, that's what Jesse

32:46.760 --> 32:48.911
really wants, anyway, right?

32:49.960 --> 32:51.394
Another round on me.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.678
- I'm sorry, you can't do that.
- Fine. Another round on them.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.116
Word is you're gonna be president.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.317
I don't know, how does
Secretary of the Navy sound?

32:59.400 --> 33:01.119
I've already been a secretary, honey.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.429
But you're sweet.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.993
Right before they breach our airspace,

33:09.080 --> 33:11.800
they dump the entire fucking shipment
into the Atlantic.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.315
And not pounds. Like, tons of coke.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.120
It's like a Volkswagen worth
of coke, just boom.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.431
Like a Volkswagen,
not like a Honda or something?

33:19.520 --> 33:20.636
Yeah, like a Volkswagen.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.160
What the fuck am I talking about here?
I got an old Navy buddy

33:23.200 --> 33:25.032
gives fishing tours out of Islamorada.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.555
I spent five nights
under a fucking cargo net.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.216
All right, well, maybe
you'll be more comfortable

33:29.240 --> 33:30.674
in a cushy chair, Murph.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.671
Let's work up
some sort of map of the route

33:33.760 --> 33:36.594
and make sure we have artwork
on these cigarette boats in motion.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.240
No bullshit stock photo.
I want to see surf kicking up.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.471
Got it. Sexy boats kicking up surf.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.513
Anything from the Mickey desk?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.796
MGM is suing Disney World.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.156
- No shit?
- It's a license violation.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.835
Let's work up a top for the front page,

33:50.920 --> 33:54.436
and some options
on a crying Mickey drawing.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.318
We've done crying Mickey.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.074
Twice. When Universal came to Orlando,

33:59.160 --> 34:00.640
and then when that alligator

34:00.720 --> 34:02.996
- ate that kid near Epcot.
- Oh, yeah.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.278
Who builds a theme park in a swamp?

34:06.680 --> 34:09.114
All right, give me Mickey in handcuffs.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.350
Politics?

34:12.360 --> 34:13.953
Good morning. Politics.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.632
Yeah. I just got back
from the kickoff tour with Gary Hart.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.234
Okay, anything new?

34:21.440 --> 34:22.920
I mean, it's the curtain raiser

34:23.000 --> 34:24.616
on the guy that's gonna win
the presidency, so...

34:24.639 --> 34:27.599
Keep it to 100 twills, Tom.
We're tight today.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.558
- Are you serious?
- Sports!

34:29.639 --> 34:31.393
How about those Dolphins?

34:32.280 --> 34:34.954
<i>He's knocked down. Allison has it.
Centers.</i>

34:36.000 --> 34:37.400
<i>He scores!</i>

34:38.000 --> 34:39.992
<i>Mike Allison scores...</i>

34:40.080 --> 34:41.672
Tom Fiedler.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.080
Hello?

34:48.719 --> 34:51.679
<i>Did you write the story
about Gary Hart today?</i>

34:53.080 --> 34:54.560
Yeah. That was me.

34:56.199 --> 34:59.318
He's having an affair
with a friend of mine.

35:02.760 --> 35:03.830
What's her name?

35:03.920 --> 35:05.070
What's your name?

35:05.160 --> 35:06.913
<i>I can't tell you that!</i>

35:08.240 --> 35:10.311
Look, this isn't funny, okay?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.995
I mean, you just can't call people
and make allegations.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.515
- So who are you, and...
<i>- She's flying up there</i>

35:15.600 --> 35:18.434
to see him in Washington this weekend.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.200
Hart's not in D.C. this weekend.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.873
He's going to Kentucky for the Derby.

35:26.960 --> 35:27.996
Sorry, lady.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.190
Wait.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.314
I want to ask you,

35:33.160 --> 35:34.879
<i>do you guys pay for pictures?</i>

35:37.040 --> 35:38.110
That's great. Jesus.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.799
Good luck, lady.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.959
- What'd he say?
- He hung up.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.376
- Thank you so much.
- That's great...

35:53.400 --> 35:54.914
- Hi... Yes.
- You can go out...

35:55.000 --> 35:57.993
Yes, sir, he is a voice for
the working man, that's correct.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.496
That's right, ma'am.
Thank you so much for...

36:00.520 --> 36:02.320
- Glad we can count on your support.
- Yeah...

36:07.720 --> 36:10.155
<i>My name's Gary Hart.
I'm running for president.</i>

36:10.720 --> 36:13.320
<i>Now, over the next year, you're gonna
see a lot of campaign ads...</i>

36:13.400 --> 36:14.629
Goddamn, he looks good.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.336
- He... Yeah, he's great.
- That's a great tie.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.999
- Very attractive man.
- Yeah.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.656
I think I like
the second take better, though.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.816
He's got his hand in his pocket.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.800
Senator Hart actually opposed
the current administration's efforts

36:24.880 --> 36:27.679
to reduce federal unemployment benefits.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.400
Yes. He actually also voted
against every aspect

36:30.480 --> 36:32.517
of the Reagan program in 1981.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.238
Well, you know what,
that's fantastic to hear.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.710
Well, we will.
Eileen, I really appreciate it.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.959
Hal will call you about where to send
the check and all that, and...

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
Righto.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.120
Okay. Talk soon.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.120
You're a free man.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.936
- Until call time tomorrow.
- Thank you. Irene,

36:48.960 --> 36:51.680
will you tell Steve and Kitty
I can't make Kentucky?

36:51.760 --> 36:53.035
You're gonna miss the Derby?

36:53.120 --> 36:55.271
And get Ellie to get me some coffee.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.870
You never get the tacos.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.360
Someone should have told you that.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.794
But Friday's taco day, man.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.519
Yeah. Let me know how Saturday goes.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.710
- Hey.
- What's doing?

37:33.560 --> 37:35.517
I think I need your help on something.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.716
You all right?

37:37.640 --> 37:39.000
You look like you've seen a ghost.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.230
All right!

37:42.600 --> 37:43.829
Won't be a moment.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.429
There's the beef.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.200
It's not bad, actually.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.033
A lot of potatoes in that one
right there?

37:53.120 --> 37:54.349
- It's good.
- Yeah.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.669
Baked potatoes too?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.797
- Fries are pretty good, huh?
- Good gravy.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.840
But don't let your burger
that I slaved over go cold, okay?

38:02.920 --> 38:03.990
Sure.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.616
We'd like the burger to be mentioned
in the first paragraph, A.J.,

38:11.640 --> 38:13.359
- if that's okay.
- Sure. Absolutely.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.353
Maybe the best thing I've done
this entire campaign.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.514
So, are we almost done?

38:20.600 --> 38:21.716
Just about.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.517
Have you... Have you read the book yet?

38:25.920 --> 38:27.513
Just about. It's Tolstoy.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.318
Can I ask you about your separation?

38:44.400 --> 38:45.536
It's a fairly common occurrence.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.835
I'd avoid it if you can.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.016
Look, I'm not having fun
asking about this,

38:50.040 --> 38:51.040
in case you're wondering.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.236
I wasn't.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.760
Well... Well, look, I just...

38:54.800 --> 38:56.800
Why should anybody care?
How... How is it relevant?

38:56.880 --> 38:58.216
- Well, some people feel like...
- Senator?

38:58.240 --> 38:59.776
...it's hard to know you,
and I'm trying to help...

38:59.800 --> 39:01.871
No. Why are... People...
Who are these people

39:01.960 --> 39:03.536
- everyone keeps telling me about?
- Okay, fine.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.976
- Because no...
- Maybe... Maybe some of us.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.639
- We feel that way.
- So, reporters?

39:06.720 --> 39:07.836
Some of us, yes.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.832
Some of you
who were still in high school

39:09.920 --> 39:11.416
when I was running McGovern's campaign.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.696
A.J., either ask something else...

39:12.720 --> 39:15.155
It's not my fault you're just arriving
at the party, A.J.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.356
Well, okay. Fine.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.976
So, around that time
you told Gail Sheehy

39:18.000 --> 39:20.390
you believed in reform marriage,
what did that mean?

39:20.480 --> 39:21.800
For crying out loud. I...

39:22.960 --> 39:26.032
I was young and tired and living
across the country from my wife,

39:26.120 --> 39:27.190
and I made a stupid joke.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.239
You know, this right here is why
people don't want to be in public life,

39:30.320 --> 39:35.190
because someone will dredge up something
you said in a moment 15 years ago

39:35.280 --> 39:37.237
and act like it somehow
encapsulates your life.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.376
- Look. Hey, look, I don't...
- No, look I... I'm gonna

39:39.400 --> 39:40.816
answer one more of these.
I'm not gonna sit here anymore.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.176
We've covered all the stuff
that matters.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.200
Did... Did you ask Reagan

39:43.280 --> 39:44.816
- about his marriage?
- All right, let's wrap this up.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.816
No, no. Listen, did you ask
Carter these questions?

39:46.840 --> 39:48.576
There have been rumors,
particularly about...

39:48.600 --> 39:51.354
For God's sake, A.J., just ask
whatever it is you came here to ask

39:51.440 --> 39:54.478
or whatever your editor
told you to ask me.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.195
This is beneath you.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.840
Okay.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.550
Do you feel like you have
a traditional marriage?

40:08.040 --> 40:09.040
"A..."

40:10.800 --> 40:12.576
- Yeah, no, that's it. We're done here.
- You know,

40:12.600 --> 40:15.216
you... You want to know what I'm doing
in my spare time, A.J., is that it?

40:15.240 --> 40:17.471
Follow me around, put a tail on me.
You'd be very bored.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.510
That was bullshit.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.595
Just relax.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.717
- What am I supposed to do?
- Act bored.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.080
Most people just look bored.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.556
- What does she look like?
- Attractive. You know?

40:51.640 --> 40:53.472
Hot enough to make you leave your wife.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.279
Honestly, it wouldn't take that much.

40:56.680 --> 40:57.750
<i>Miami passengers...</i>

41:00.040 --> 41:04.353
<i>Please have your passports available
for inspection by the gate agent.</i>

41:23.800 --> 41:25.120
Stop staring at 'em.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.678
You don't have to look
at the floor. Just...

41:28.760 --> 41:31.229
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.040
- What would you like, ma'am?
- Just a...

41:34.120 --> 41:35.456
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

41:35.480 --> 41:38.632
<i>We will soon be arriving
at Washington National Airport.</i>

41:57.960 --> 41:59.280
Do we know where they're going?

41:59.360 --> 42:00.635
I know where Hart lives.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.674
This one here on the left.

42:07.760 --> 42:08.796
You want me to pull over?

42:08.920 --> 42:09.956
Just hang a second.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.040
No security? Nothing?

42:11.120 --> 42:13.237
- You think this is it?
- It's his place.

42:15.240 --> 42:17.596
- You guys getting out?
- Just give us a second.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.632
- No Secret Service?
- He isn't the nominee yet.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.496
Look, I don't know
what you guys are up to, but...

42:21.520 --> 42:23.239
I think somebody pulled your leg, buddy.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.000
We've been here
all of two fucking seconds.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.560
Look, this isn't a peep show.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.016
Now, which one of you guys
are paying me?

42:28.040 --> 42:29.713
New destination.
We're gonna need a hotel.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.870
Hold on!

42:33.800 --> 42:35.120
Look, man, I'm...

42:48.040 --> 42:49.554
Fuck me.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.552
- You chilly?
- Yeah.

42:51.640 --> 42:53.279
We're gonna need a photographer.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.036
Hi.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.520
Is this the stakeout?

43:08.840 --> 43:10.638
No, we ran out of gas.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.632
Will you get in the fucking car, please?

43:14.120 --> 43:16.032
- Right, sure. Yeah.
- Get in the car.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.234
Jesus fucking Christ.

43:25.880 --> 43:26.996
You sure they're in there?

43:27.080 --> 43:29.640
Yeah, yeah. We saw them
come in and out a couple of times.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.355
"Follow me around."

43:35.600 --> 43:38.320
Hart told <i>The Post</i>
to follow him around. Hey, Roy.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.437
"Follow me around, put a tail on me.

43:40.520 --> 43:43.399
- "You'd be very bored."
- He asked us to follow him.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.392
Technically, you were
already following him.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.392
Look, it's an invitation.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.157
We... We have a responsibility here.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.594
Are some folks in Iowa
seriously supposed to vet

43:53.680 --> 43:56.639
some governor or congressman
from God-knows-where?

43:58.320 --> 44:01.313
You know, it... It's up to us

44:01.720 --> 44:03.074
to hold these guys accountable.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.109
Shit.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.960
Is there a reason you brought a camera?

44:16.040 --> 44:17.872
- Yeah, sure. Right.
- Go ahead.

44:17.960 --> 44:19.030
Yeah, okay.

44:22.440 --> 44:27.117
<i>...have a triple, two singles,
and all they have for it is a tie.</i>

44:27.200 --> 44:28.998
<i>Raines, and then Wallach.</i>

44:29.080 --> 44:33.233
<i>Winningham at first, Candaele at second
and Nichols at third.</i>

44:47.720 --> 44:49.393
- Hey.
- Hey, Senator.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.994
Last... Last draft here.

44:51.080 --> 44:53.720
- We changed the last paragraph here...
- Yup.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.553
And you've done that already? Good.

44:55.640 --> 44:56.710
Yeah.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.518
- No, that's it. It's good.
- Okay?

45:07.640 --> 45:08.790
- Okay.
- Bye.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.833
Wilson, the policy guy.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.070
Did he make you?

45:18.160 --> 45:19.753
I don't think so. Fuck.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.756
Have you seen the girl?

45:22.840 --> 45:24.479
I... I need a closer look.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.199
Guys, it stinks in here.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.953
Who are they? Bush campaign?

45:30.080 --> 45:31.514
I don't know. Maybe.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.678
Better head on back to your place.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.315
Fuck.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.280
Come on, come on.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.800
Do you think he saw us?

47:30.720 --> 47:32.154
Good evening, gentlemen.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.229
Evening, Senator.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.072
I'm a reporter from the <i>Miami Herald.</i>

47:40.560 --> 47:41.994
We... We'd like to talk to you.

47:43.320 --> 47:46.916
I'd like to ask you about the woman
that's staying in your townhouse.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.320
No one is staying in my townhouse.

47:49.840 --> 47:53.629
We saw you leave and come back with
the same woman. It's a blonde woman.

47:54.600 --> 47:55.875
I may, I may not have.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.280
We saw you.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.431
I don't know what you think you saw.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.916
Hello, Senator.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.150
Tom?

48:11.200 --> 48:12.200
Yes, sir.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.392
I wonder if you could tell us

48:15.480 --> 48:18.154
whether this woman
works for the campaign,

48:18.240 --> 48:19.594
the one we saw you with.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.233
She's not part of my campaign.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.320
Okay.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.832
Then can you tell us how you know her?

48:27.960 --> 48:29.056
I don't think that's relevant.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.833
I can assure you, Senator,
this is relevant.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.416
Yeah, it's just that we saw you leave
and come back with this woman,

48:33.440 --> 48:35.238
and we... We didn't see her...

48:35.320 --> 48:37.016
Tom, you can't be serious.
No one is staying in my home.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.480
There's no need for that, all right?

48:40.280 --> 48:41.794
I am serious, sir.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.416
How long have you known this woman?

48:44.440 --> 48:45.440
What kind of question...

48:45.520 --> 48:46.576
What kind of questions are these?

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
Is she a friend?

48:47.680 --> 48:49.056
Well, I don't know
why I would tell you that.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.336
- Tom, I am not going to...
- Can you produce her

48:50.360 --> 48:51.456
to corroborate what you're saying here?

48:51.480 --> 48:52.656
I don't have to produce anything.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.736
This has gone on long enough.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.496
Senator, we know you've made calls
to this woman

48:55.520 --> 48:56.720
from Kansas and New Hampshire.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.416
- We have the dates.
- Well, I make calls every day.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.816
I don't see how I'd remember,
and I don't...

48:59.840 --> 49:01.416
But, Senator, I was at
your announcement speech, okay?

49:01.440 --> 49:03.159
You said... You said,

49:03.240 --> 49:04.416
- "We must hold ourselves accountable..."
- I know what I...

49:04.440 --> 49:05.936
- I know what I said.
- "...to the highest possible

49:05.960 --> 49:08.350
"standards of integrity and ethics."

49:09.800 --> 49:11.234
Then why are we standing here?

49:12.080 --> 49:14.436
Why are we standing in an alley
on a Saturday night?

49:14.520 --> 49:15.976
I mean, don't you think you owe it to us

49:16.000 --> 49:17.480
- to be forthcoming?
- Owe you?

49:17.600 --> 49:19.056
You're denying what we've seen
with our own eyes.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.912
The only thing I deny
is the idea that somehow

49:21.000 --> 49:22.616
you have the right
to ask me these things.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.416
- You're running for president.
- I'm aware of that, Tom.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.296
- It's in the papers.
- Well, you have a responsibility.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.096
I know full well
what my responsibilities are.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.395
Do you know yours?

49:32.440 --> 49:33.440
Senator.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.273
Have you had sex with that woman?

49:37.400 --> 49:38.754
You should be...

49:38.840 --> 49:40.832
You should be ashamed of yourself.

49:40.920 --> 49:43.515
The only one putting you
in this alley, Tom, is you.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.715
Holy shit.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.674
We gotta type this up.

50:02.520 --> 50:04.876
Hey, Billy. Get Dixon now.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.616
Hey, how long is it going
to take you to develop those?

50:22.640 --> 50:25.439
About eight, 10 minutes.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.616
- All right. Well, don't fuck it up.
- Something like that.

50:27.640 --> 50:29.074
I'll try not to.

50:31.160 --> 50:32.389
All right. Okay.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.154
Fuck me.

50:39.240 --> 50:40.356
Coffee.

50:45.080 --> 50:46.080
Hey.

50:49.840 --> 50:52.036
- They want us to hold for a day.
- Why?

50:52.120 --> 50:54.656
Just until we can get our shit straight,
maybe get the girl's name.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.016
I can't. We'll lose half the readers.

50:56.040 --> 50:57.679
We can't do it. We can't do it.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.216
No, no, it's not...
It's not a Monday story.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.720
It's a Sunday story.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.154
Yeah, we saw her.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.640
We saw her.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.239
We got pictures. We got everything.

51:13.760 --> 51:14.796
<i>Hello?</i>

51:14.880 --> 51:16.200
<i>Hey. How soon can you pick me up?</i>

51:16.240 --> 51:19.278
<i>- We need to get to D.C.
- What's... What's going on?</i>

51:19.360 --> 51:22.114
<i>I can't tell you. It's Gary.</i>

51:23.680 --> 51:25.319
Forty-two minutes.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.856
Hey, you want to say "linked" here?

51:29.880 --> 51:30.936
Saying she's "tied to Hart"

51:30.960 --> 51:32.096
- kind of sounds...
- Professional.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.555
No, like whips and chains
and shit going on.

51:34.640 --> 51:35.640
I know, I know.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.674
- Hello?
<i>- Billy.</i>

51:39.760 --> 51:41.240
<i>- Yeah.
- They're here.</i>

51:41.320 --> 51:42.376
<i>I brought 'em back to my place.</i>

51:42.400 --> 51:44.995
Tell Fiedler we can give him
an interview with the girl.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.396
Yes, yes. Just tell him anything.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.119
Just straighten this out.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.556
Yes. Just buy us some time.

51:58.600 --> 52:02.310
Okay, Donna, Donna,
I need you to be straight with me here.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.600
<i>Maybe you told somebody.</i>

52:04.680 --> 52:06.273
<i>Your mama, the mailman.</i>

52:06.360 --> 52:07.589
<i>Somebody.</i>

52:08.600 --> 52:10.512
<i>Gary said the reporters are from Miami.</i>

52:10.600 --> 52:13.479
<i>That means they're following you,
not Gary.</i>

52:14.800 --> 52:16.553
- Are we...
- I don't know.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.152
<i>Okay, well, can I talk to her?</i>

52:23.240 --> 52:27.120
No, I can put you on the phone
with the girl if you give me a day.

52:27.600 --> 52:28.856
Yeah, how about I give you a week?

52:28.880 --> 52:30.678
- You want a month?
<i>- No, come on, now.</i>

52:30.760 --> 52:32.911
You give me a day, huh?

52:33.400 --> 52:34.400
We'll talk about it.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.675
They're stalling.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.072
Listen, we know what you're doing, okay?

52:39.160 --> 52:40.656
We're not writing
for some college paper here.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.717
We're not giving you a day, all right?

52:42.800 --> 52:44.160
Give me a day, and I'll put you...

52:46.600 --> 52:49.195
<i>We haven't fact-checked a word of this.</i>

52:49.280 --> 52:51.715
<i>You don't even have the woman's name.</i>

52:51.840 --> 52:54.435
<i>You want to rush to print
with some other paper's quote,</i>

52:54.520 --> 52:56.193
<i>a quote from</i> The Post?

52:56.280 --> 52:58.237
- We need the quote.
<i>- You want the quote.</i>

52:58.360 --> 53:00.556
- We can credit <i>The Post.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:00.640 --> 53:03.712
All right, look, we could...
We could tease the interview,

53:03.800 --> 53:04.896
follow it up later in the week?

53:04.920 --> 53:06.479
No, no, no. I'm telling you right now,

53:06.560 --> 53:08.358
they're gonna find a way
to spin this thing.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.432
You guys are crazy.
We got him right now.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.520
We got him dead to rights.
You're gonna let him go.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.791
Easy, Crockett. This isn't a drug bust.

53:14.920 --> 53:17.719
<i>He was asking for it. Yeah, that's...</i>

53:17.840 --> 53:19.800
- I mean, that is the story.
- I got it, I got it.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.270
You guys are walking away from this.
Hang on, hang on.

- Dad.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.516
It's the middle of the night.
Is everything okay?

Should never be written.

Good. It sounds like you should.

Feel stupid for a while.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.718
<i>...today, and Thursday,
before a congressional panel</i>

56:17.800 --> 56:21.430
<i>investigating the Iran-Contra Affair.
He also conceded that...</i>

56:31.240 --> 56:32.720
What's going on, Donna?

56:35.320 --> 56:36.515
I don't know.

56:38.840 --> 56:40.479
I just want to go home.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.239
Can I go home now?

56:46.320 --> 56:47.320
Soon.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.520
I know you want to get home.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.360
I don't belong here.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.638
I just need to get the facts.

57:04.640 --> 57:05.869
Talk to Gary.

57:07.840 --> 57:10.878
Gary's not a real big talker
when it comes to

57:13.120 --> 57:14.713
this kind of thing.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.679
I told you already.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.312
I wanted a job with the campaign.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.753
B.B. arranged the interview.

57:30.320 --> 57:31.436
"Interview."

57:32.200 --> 57:34.556
You've worked in politics before, Donna?

57:36.320 --> 57:39.279
No. I just wanted to work
for Senator Hart.

57:39.920 --> 57:41.354
Why's that?

57:41.440 --> 57:43.557
I like his positions.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.757
You think I'm some stupid bimbo.

58:04.640 --> 58:06.791
I don't think anything.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.432
I sell pharmaceuticals, you know?

58:09.520 --> 58:10.749
Okay.

58:10.880 --> 58:13.395
I was the top saleswoman in my district.

58:13.480 --> 58:14.800
I don't doubt it.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.072
I graduated Phi Beta Kappa.

58:20.320 --> 58:22.755
I did all the things
I was supposed to do

58:22.840 --> 58:24.399
to make sure that men don't look at me

58:24.520 --> 58:26.876
the way that you're looking
at me right now.

58:36.640 --> 58:38.154
I just want to go home.

58:43.320 --> 58:45.312
Yeah, let's see
how we're doing with that.

58:53.840 --> 58:55.513
The <i>Herald</i> piece just came across.

58:55.600 --> 58:56.600
Jesus. Already?

58:56.720 --> 58:58.518
Yeah, they didn't exactly wait
for comment.

58:59.160 --> 59:00.310
Did Gary see it?

59:00.400 --> 59:02.756
No. We sent him to Georgetown.
Steve and Kitty's.

59:02.840 --> 59:06.470
Yeah, who he should have gone
to the fucking Derby with.

59:07.520 --> 59:08.520
Okay.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.190
Let's go.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.196
You're up.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.752
It shouldn't take much.

59:31.320 --> 59:32.800
<i>Presidential candidate Gary Hart</i>

59:32.920 --> 59:35.310
<i>has dismissed allegations
he's a womanizer,</i>

59:35.400 --> 59:38.154
<i>challenging reporters
to follow him around.</i>

59:38.240 --> 59:41.358
<i>Well, this weekend,
the</i> Miami Herald <i>did just that.</i>

59:41.440 --> 59:43.272
- They're using my quote.
- Congratulations.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.352
- It's completely out of context.
- What context?

59:45.440 --> 59:47.600
The only context is the idiot
says, "Follow me around,"

59:47.680 --> 59:49.194
and then goes and fucks his mistress.

59:49.280 --> 59:51.296
It was a throwaway line.
They're using it after the fact

59:51.320 --> 59:52.913
to justify their tabloid bullshit.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.912
Would we have staked him out? No.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.798
- If we knew about the girl?
- I hope not.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.030
So you get to decide what...

59:58.120 --> 59:59.600
All right, all right, that's enough.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.474
Just covering their asses.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.750
I swear this is true.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.192
New Year's Eve after Jack died,

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.476
Lyndon Johnson sits down
with a whole bunch of us,

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.280
pulls us in close and says,
"Boys, you're gonna see

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.034
"a whole lot of women coming
in and out of my hotel suites.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.033
"I want you to pay us
the same courtesy you did Jack."

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.630
And we did.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.959
- Different time, Ben.
- Yeah, but why?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.759
I mean, who decides that?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.910
The readers.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.640
And if the readers want
to see the candidates naked?

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.518
Well, that's one kind
of measuring contest.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.875
Has anyone seen Hart?

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.440
No, he's gone into hiding.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.640
Sweeney won't tell me where.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.757
He's got a big econ speech
Tuesday in New York

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.672
with the Newspaper Association.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.753
- The publishers.
- All right.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.192
Suppose we start with something small.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.638
Write up a story from the wires
about the <i>Herald's</i> little exposÃ©.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.235
Are we going after Hart or the <i>Herald?</i>

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.952
<i>When Americans choose presidents,
personal character traits are important,</i>

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.640
<i>and most candidates agree
they should be.</i>

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.072
Mom, what's going on?

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.510
Maureen, listen to what I'm telling you.
They were hiding in the bushes, okay?

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.877
Like fucking scavengers.
Is that journalism?

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.716
Right.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.557
I've got Mrs. Hart on line five.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.154
Maureen, listen, I got to go, okay?

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.675
But do me a favor
and remind your editors

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.672
that they run
<i>The New York</i> fucking <i>Times!</i>

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.911
Okay? And not <i>Us Weekly.</i>

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.239
That's funny. You're hilarious.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.315
You don't think he...

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.150
You got a car?

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280
No, sir.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.150
Mrs. Hart.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.274
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.555
I've got no comment.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.336
- Are you with the Hart campaign?
- I'm sorry. I've got no comment.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.120
Is Lee coming out?
Will there be a statement?

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.376
I really don't know. I'm sorry.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.976
Do you just have time for one question?
Have you had

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.416
- any conversations with her?
- How are you, young man?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.193
Steve Dunleavy, <i>A Current Affair.</i>

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.456
<i>- "A Current Affair"?</i>
- Who are you going to see in there?

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.096
- You bringing a message from Gary?
- I don't... I got...

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.576
- I gotta go. Please!
- Can you just give us a statement

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.256
before you go in? Tell me
your role in the Hart campaign.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.456
You just come to keep her company?

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.576
Can you just bring Lee out?
Just make one statement for us.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.876
- Have you talked to her?
- The kid's in there.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.394
What an asshole.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.955
Joe Trippi, ma'am.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.639
We met with the campaign.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.876
I'm...

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.440
I'm here to help.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.230
Okay.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.874
What's your plan?

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.471
So, it's really just
a pretty simple stacking game.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.791
I used to play it with my grandfather.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.952
Everybody gets seven cards.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.838
So, one, two...

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.193
Sure you don't want some?

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.750
Tea?

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.876
Yeah.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.633
Can you make a hot tea?

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.280
What's...

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.510
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.797
Why were they interrogating me?

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.997
The standard practice for...

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.276
Is to get all the damaging facts
out yourself, if there are any.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.155
So, that way, it doesn't look
like you're hiding.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.432
But they'll leave me out of it?

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.674
My parents won't hear
about any of this, will they?

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.960
We know what we're doing.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.997
B.B. did say that you might
have a job for me.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.910
Fundraising?

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.391
I graduated <i>magna cum laude.</i>

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.714
That's impressive.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.437
Do you believe it, about a job?

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.479
You sound very qualified.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.594
Yeah, well,

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.192
when you're a model,
you know, people just assume.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.920
That you can't be smart.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.030
Yeah.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.152
I don't have that problem.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.277
- No, I wasn't comparing.
- I'm kidding.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.114
I mean, I don't have that problem.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.594
But I get why you do.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.237
You want some honey in that, honey?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.600
Southern Comfort.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.352
Well, we'll throw
a little fire in there.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.696
<i>We can't leave unskilled workers</i>

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.155
wondering what happens
to them and their families.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.800
I mean, when they hear the word
"technology," they...

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.056
They think you're taking away
their job, so move that up.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.675
Hey. How are you holding up?

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.395
You know, we have to...

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.358
When we talk about a digitized economy,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.716
we have to talk more
about equality of opportunity.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.152
Gary, we can't hide from this.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.114
Who's hiding? I'm working.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.998
We need to say something.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.910
I've already spoken
to the person that matters.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.992
There are stories
being written right now.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.440
It's gossip, Dix. It'll blow over.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.154
I don't think it's gonna "blow over."

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.960
We need to go through some things.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.191
Now. Like this boat cruise
I'm hearing about, for one.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.336
Do you think they completely missed

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.158
- the back door of the townhouse?
- Bimini?

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.736
- I mean, I know...
- It's not in the piece.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.296
- If they don't have her leaving...
- So?

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.096
Yeah, no, exactly.
I mean, without the back door,

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.816
- the entire article amounts...
- Gary, I mean, the whole...

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840
...to, yeah, garbage.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.550
That whole trip... Bimini
and Billy fucking Broadhurst.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.555
God. Forget the back door.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.856
The point is,
it's nobody's goddamn business.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.200
None of it is.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.056
Right? They shouldn't
have been there, period.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.440
Now, if we could all just move on.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.193
The... Yeah, that's what
we're trying to do.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.000
I mean, I've been doing this
for 20 years. So have you.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.799
The public doesn't care about this crap.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.109
They won't stand for it.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.456
- They won't.
- I don't know. It...

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.119
You know, it's not '72.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.916
It's not even '82. It's different now.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.296
- It's not different.
- I wish it wasn't.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.960
It is, and...
And I don't understand why,

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.238
but we have to figure out
how we're gonna respond to this story.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.913
We're not... There is no story.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.917
They can write all this crap
all they want.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.913
They will not earn the dignity
of my response.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.473
Jesus, Gary. What about us?

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.914
Do we deserve a response?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.356
- About this?
- Yeah.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.360
No.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.039
Are you kidding me?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.431
I got 100 kids unpacking boxes
in Denver right now

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.718
because we told them you would do
what it takes to win this thing.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.910
I told them.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.555
The best and the brightest.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.280
They left jobs.
They left their families.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.317
People are sacrificing for you.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.629
And I'm not sacrificing?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.519
What, should I sacrifice
my privacy, Bill?

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.000
My self-respect?

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.296
And it won't just be me
that gets dragged down.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.576
None of those kids you're talking about

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.478
will work another campaign
where some candidate

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.392
doesn't have to account
for who comes and goes

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.790
from their bedroom,
and that is just the beginning.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.536
Okay, okay, but we're not...
We're not talking

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.456
- about that right now.
- I am talking about that.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:25.518
No, no. We're talking about
how you get through today

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.456
without pissing away everything
we've all worked for

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:28.834
- on this campaign!
- No, Bill.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.755
This campaign is about the future,
not rumors, not sleaze,

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.354
and I care about the sanctity
of this process,

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.158
whether you do or do not!

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.915
I want to reexamine
this language on page 17.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.908
"It's not..."

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:03.040
Here it is. "It's not just the specter
of a trade war I worry about,

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.952
"it's our loss of influence globally."

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.154
I saw a bar.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.430
That's my one time in Miami.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.398
Shit-faced, lost, bumming a ride

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:28.040
off some lecherous guy
I knew I'd never see again.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120
Thank you.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.988
Guys in Miami are...

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.116
Thank you.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.032
Well, one of my ex-boyfriends

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.555
had his car repo'd
while we were at the movies.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.555
Seriously?

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:43.916
And another one is in jail
for selling cocaine.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.992
- That's classy.
- Yeah.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.796
Even my mom doesn't know about that one.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:52.993
Gary is so different.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.956
How so?

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.032
I feel like I can
just be quiet with him.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.510
Myself.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.759
You ever have that feeling?

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.990
Yeah.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.910
I'm sorry you got caught up
in this, Donna.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.031
This whole world we're in,

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.511
none of it's making sense right now.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.516
You have to be smart.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.200
Well, you are.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.595
Thank you.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.960
I mean, coming from someone like you...

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.675
Look at where you are.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.114
If she swears it was a job interview,

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.556
that has to mean something. Right?

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.357
I've known Gary a long time.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.997
In '84, we were at a hotel.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.117
I forget which one. Doesn't matter.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.391
There was Gary and me and Warren Beatty.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.914
And Gary's wigging out

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.720
because he might actually
win the thing, you know?

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.670
He starts grilling
the Secret Service guys.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.477
"If I'm president and I want
to fly to Boulder for the day

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.280
"and shop for used books
with my kids, how about that?

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.874
"What about my private time?"

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.957
And Warren says,
"Gary, you're not getting it.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.793
"There is no privacy.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.111
"The cameras go everywhere now."

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.236
And Gary was, like, confounded.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.271
He says, "Well, that's...
That's Hollywood, Warren.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.074
"That's the paparazzi.
That's not politics."

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.350
He's right, isn't he?

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.433
I don't know. Is he?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.076

<i>Well,</i>

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.720

Yeah, he told me to keep my chin up.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.550
He's a lovely man.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.556
Strange.

Man.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.320
These people.

These people want to feel
outrage for me,

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.078
but it doesn't belong to them.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.712
Won't be easy getting out of that gate.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400
I know.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.960
We'll have to figure it out.

What?

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.200
I need to see my husband.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.873
Mom, seriously?

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.032
I have spent 30 years of my life
with your father.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.754
I have made many allowances.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.397
What, you think
I should feel humiliated?

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.553
Feelings that simple are
a privilege of being young.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.393
You need to let him deal with this, Mom.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.080
He will. He will.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.114
Rusting industrial base.

Deteriorating public infrastructure.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.358
Declining system of public education.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.955
Astounding accumulation
of public and private debt.

- The 49th Street entrance?
- No, we're going here.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.816
- Why are we going in here?
- Because the front's worse.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840
Tenth is jammed.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.176
Mike, how do you want
to go in right here?

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.496
- Has Dix seen what they've got?
- Are you serious?

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.000
- Billy.
- Jesus Christ!

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.311
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Senator Hart!

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760
Go, go. Drive.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.016
- Where am I gonna go?
- Go around front.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.416
- I'm afraid I might kill somebody.
- Go around front.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440
Jesus.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.079
Please open the door!

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.560
Come on.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.233
Mr. Hart, are you dropping out?

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.198
Gotta go. Let's go.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.876
How can the American people trust you?

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.833
So, how was your weekend, Gary?

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.920
Is that Tom?

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.316
Brokaw? Is that Brokaw here?

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.393
Guess they're really curious
about your economics plan.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.120
Hell of a deal, Gary.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.635
Hell of a deal.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.233
Senator Hart? Sir.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.480
- Yeah.
- Latest revisions, sir.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.000
- Pen.
- Sorry?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.594
You got a pen?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.229
He's making changes.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.754
Changes on the changes?

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.672
<i>Okay, I believe we are ready to begin.</i>

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.199
<i>On Sunday, at Ellis Island,

<i>the current president
of the United States.</i>

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.234
<i>Tomorrow, right here,
a former president will speak.</i>

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
<i>- Today...</i>
- If he's here,

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.536

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.136
<i>...we offer you two men who,
by their own admission</i>

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.790
<i>and by the urgings of others,
would like to become president.</i>

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.879
Kid's a fucking retard.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.696
Ken, we're losing the senator's eyes.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.056
- What?
- They're lost in the shadows.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.536
- You can't see his eyes.
- I'm not worried

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.840
about seeing his eyes right now.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.873
<i>Please welcome our first speaker,</i>

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.874
<i>from the state of Colorado,

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.760
<i>Good afternoon. Thank you.</i>

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.676
<i>I came here today
to talk to you about America's future.</i>

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.520
<i>That is what my campaign is and...</i>

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.834
<i>And ought to be about.</i>

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.400
<i>But with your permission,</i>

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.597
<i>I'd like to address the events
of the past few days,</i>

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.957
<i>which you, no doubt, have been
discussing amongst yourselves.</i>

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.154
<i>Last weekend, a newspaper
published a misleading story</i>

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.232
<i>that hurt my family</i>

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.316
<i>and reflected badly upon my character.</i>

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.956
<i>The story was written byjournalists</i>

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.317
<i>who, by their own admission,
undertook a spotty surveillance.</i>

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.954
Jesus Christ. Man the lifeboats.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.909
<i>Sorry, what was that?</i>

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.474
You're doing great, Senator.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.936
<i>Is there something you'd like to ask me,
or does the</i> Miami Herald

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.816
<i>- prefer to chat in alleyways?</i>
- Fuck. What do we do?

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.320
- I can yell, "Fire."
- He's got this.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.096
This is not a story about
the <i>Miami Herald,</i> Senator.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.236
It's a story about

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.776
- Gary Hart's judgment.
<i>- Right, sorry.</i>

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.520
<i>Can we... Is it possible
to get Mr. Martindale a microphone?</i>

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.159
That's okay. It's not necessary.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.480
<i>I think it is. I'm pretty sure
people would love to hear.</i>

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.155
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Look, a microphone.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.191
<i>Yes. Yes, we stand by
the essential correctness of our story.</i>

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.954
<i>"The..." I'm sorry,
"the essential correctness"?</i>

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.395
<i>Yes. This is a story about a married man</i>

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.115
<i>who spent a little too much time
with an unmarried woman.</i>

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.016
<i>We didn't speculate
as to what went on, of course.</i>

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.157
<i>If I may, it was because
you simply don't know,</i>

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.550
<i>despite hiding in the bushes
outside my home.</i>

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.960
<i>Well, we certainly know that you made</i>

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.271
<i>several calls to Donna Rice
on the campaign trail.</i>

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.589
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.696
<i>We know she was seen leaving
your townhouse in Washington.</i>

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.996
<i>Was she leaving or not?
Because, in your story,</i>

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.312
<i>you said she didn't leave my home,
and now you're saying she did.</i>

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.158
<i>Right. Well, when we interviewed you...</i>

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.074
<i>No, your newsmen accosted me
in my alleyway.</i>

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.594
<i>Listen, with all due respect...</i>

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.216
<i>Well, it's a little late
for respect, sir.</i>

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.960
<i>You ambushed me outside my home
in the middle of the night</i>

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.111
<i>after putting me under
some half-baked stakeout</i>

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.830
<i>during which your reporters,
your crack reporting team,</i>

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.355
<i>failed to realize
that my home had a back door.</i>

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.716
<i>A back door?</i>

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.350
<i>Sir, some surveillance is no better
than zero surveillance.</i>

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:54.440
<i>In fact, it's worse.</i>

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.754
<i>Okay. Why don't you do your job,
and we'll do ours?</i>

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.433
<i>Well, it would be a welcome change.</i>

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.118
<i>Now, if I may, I'd like to...</i>

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.630
<i>I'd like to talk about something
a little more exciting.</i>

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.080
<i>Economics.</i>

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.896
- Got out of it.
- That's pretty good. That's good.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.832
<i>Our challenges today,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.736
<i>are greater than they've been
in over five decades.</i>

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.752
Okay, so there's a driver
downstairs waiting.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.336
- He'll take you wherever you need to go.
- Thank you.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.080
And we've got a guy here in Miami.
A lawyer.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.000
I just want to...

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.680
Just let me give you his number. Really.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.990
Thank you.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.791
- Donna. Donna.
- Donna!

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.440
Are you and Gary in love?

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.760
Was your boyfriend a drug dealer?

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.240
Do you have ties to the drug trade?

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.718
<i>Did he tell you that this was something
you should not get involved in?</i>

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.352
<i>- No.
- He didn't tell you,</i>

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.511
<i>Fawn or Miss Hall,
whatever he called you,</i>

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.320
<i>to go home and "Don't worry about this"?</i>

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.560
All right, this one's got turkey
with cheese...

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.216
- Back to New Hampshire.
- I'll take it.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.310
Live free or die.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.278
I wonder how many people pick "die."

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.192
Is there tuna salad?

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.516
- No, I didn't order that.
- Are you sure?

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.717
I stand by the essential correctness
of my order.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.040
- The essential correctness?
- The essential correctness.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.756
I can't... I can't answer
these questions anymore. It's just...

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.474
One more presser.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.656
We let them ask whatever they want,

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.720
then we put it to bed,
we get back to the big ideas.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.672
<i>You have conceded
that you weren't able to</i>

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.837
<i>watch the back of his townhouse</i>

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.594
<i>and that, therefore,
the lady in question,</i>

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.509
<i>may have left
when you thought she was still there.</i>

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.720
<i>Well, that's...</i>

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.276
<i>Mr. Koppel... Ted...</i>

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.114
<i>If we're conceding
that we're not as good as the FBI</i>

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.429
<i>at conducting surveillance,</i>

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.376
<i>then I think we have no problem
agreeing to that.</i>

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.995
<i>That's kind of cute,
but that's not the point.</i>

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.256
<i>The point is,
did she spend the night with him?</i>

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.078
<i>And if, in fact, she left,</i>

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.696
<i>let's say, a half hour
after she got there,</i>

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
<i>which is what she claims,</i>

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.720
<i>then she would not have
spent the night with him.</i>

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.916
<i>Right.</i>

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.070
<i>Well, not right. I mean...</i>

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.896
<i>Is this the story that
the</i> Miami Herald <i>drops now,</i>

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:50.231
<i>or, I mean, do you...
You feel you've worked it?</i>

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.471
<i>I don't know what you mean by that.</i>

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.917
<i>Let me put to you
an alternative question.</i>

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.514
<i>This wasn't a competitive story.</i>

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.536
<i>There was no one else
breathing down your neck on this.</i>

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.837
<i>You could have waited
another 24 hours and got it right.</i>

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.719
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
I believe we did get it right.</i>

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.713
<i>You have spoken several times,
Mr. Fiedler...</i>

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.120
Jesus.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.833
Run this by me again.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.479
They're part of a P.I. report.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.439
A certain senator thought his wife
was sleeping with Hart.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.239
- I know this broad.
- Gum?

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.515
Yeah, she's a lobbyist.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.910
No, thanks. Who?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.434
We're thinking Tydings.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.716
But as it turns out,
Hart isn't fucking Mrs. Tydings.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.359
He's been schtupping this other woman.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.400
- What a town.
- How did we get this?

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.392
- Anonymous package.
- I hate that.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.872
If you got something to say,
just say it.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.996
Give me some of that gum.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.560
Do you think Tydings sent it?

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.040
- But why?
- I don't know.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.998
Wait, we're not even
talking about Bush here?

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.515
I mean, Hart is running against
the former head of the CIA.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.600
- Not yet, he's not.
- No return address, no note.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.597
Just a date, six months ago.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.639
- Well, there's your other shoe, Ben.
- Yeah.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.235
Just because some unmarked
envelope lands on our laps,

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.999
that doesn't obligate us to use it.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.256
It shows a pattern of behavior.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.953
Womanizing. Lies.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.269
He's not lying to us.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.473
Christ, don't be so naive.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.320
Yeah, I'm sure this package
landed on the lap

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.437
of at least three other
enterprising journalists.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.718
Okay, so can't we let some other paper
use gossip as front page news?

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.996
- I mean, that doesn't mean we have to.
- It does, A.J.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.190
It does now.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:21.158
We decline to publish, some other
newspaper runs with the story.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.835
I don't know, the <i>Poughkeepsie Journal,</i>
the <i>Miami Herald.</i>

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.434
Maybe even <i>The New York Times.</i>

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.640
And the TVs go apeshit over this stuff.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.680
Meanwhile, we're sitting
on our high horse saying,

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.776
"Well, we still don't think it's news,
because guess what,

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.792
"we didn't think it was news before."

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.480
And then the wires start running stories

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.096
about how
we're not covering the one thing

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.759
everybody else is talking about.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.239
And so on, and so on.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.714
Hey, why do you hate him so much?

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.394
I don't hate Gary Hart.
I don't think I trust him.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.834
That's one approach.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.757
Why isn't that your approach?

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.274
It's your job to be skeptical.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.856
I don't think his own wife trusts him.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.200
Come on. You don't know that.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.918
I don't think he respects women.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.037
Are you kidding? He loves women.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.316
- Too much, frankly.
- He uses them.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.976
Well, come on.
Aren't you being a little precious?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.639
I mean, he's smart. He's handsome.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.136
These women are throwing themselves
at him.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.517
He is a man with power and opportunity.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.434
And that takes certain responsibility.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.479
If he were just some day trader
screwing around with cocktail girls,

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.517
I could handle just not liking him.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.080
But as our potential next president,

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.429
that makes me nervous,

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.910
and as a journalist, you ought to care.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.960
Yeah.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.790
You're missing all the excitement.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.633
<i>Yeah, thank God.</i>

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.837
So, it looks like

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.276
we are turning the corner out here.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.272
I could get you a flight.

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.474
What's on your mind?

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.037
I just keep thinking
this is never gonna be over for her.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.991
Every time she applies for a job...

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:41.150
She doesn't have a staff
of overeducated volunteers.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.913
As far as I can tell, she's alone.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.552
You got anything for me?

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.800
<i>Buck up, kid.</i>

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.799
You got work to do.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.029
Yeah.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.594
Sorry.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.796
Hey, Billy.
You want to let Gary know we're around,

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.872
in case he wants
to get a drink or something?

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.713
With old friends?

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.433
The senator's unavailable.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.112
"The senator's unavailable."

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.672
Fucking follow me.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.672
Can you believe that?

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.440
Okay, so they don't have a podium.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.035
- I don't need one.
- You couldn't get a podium?

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.713
Don't start with me.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.473
How are voters supposed to believe you

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.856
- when you've clearly been lying?
- They will or they won't.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.872
- I don't think they much care.
- Good. Okay.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.440
You can cite the polls here.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.160
- I don't care about polls.
- Yes, you do.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.873
Gallup just came out of the field.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.376
"Do you think the media went too far

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.936
"in its reporting
on Senator Hart's private life?"

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.316
- 64% say "Yes."
- 64% say "Yes."

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.517
"Is a candidate's behavior
in his relationship

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.717
"relevant to his qualifications
as president?"

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.393
38% say "Yes."

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.437
- 52% say "No."
- 52 "No."

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.274
- Take that, fuckers!
- 64%. God.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.920
They'll ask about phone calls.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.912
Well, I'll say I call lots of people.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.639
Right, that's fine.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.880
Are we gonna bring up Donna Rice?

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.750
We could ask the pool
to respect her privacy.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.069
Are you fucking nuts?

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.550
It might be seen as a noble gesture.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.231
They may have questions...

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.556
You know, they may have questions
about women.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.600
Well, they can talk to Irene or Ginny
or anyone who's worked for me.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.076
Yeah.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.919
I think what

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.151
Billy means is...

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:50.960
What?

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.436
Have there been others?

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.399
Women...

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.216
- That aren't your wife.
- You've got to be kidding me.

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.376
I'm not gonna answer that,
not for them and not for you.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.153
It's nobody's goddamn business!

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.075
That's it.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.837
That's perfect. That's your answer.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.920
I'll come back when it's time.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.360
I...

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.193
You know,
I've woken the last two mornings

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.919
to the sound of helicopters.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.515
They're waiting at our gates,
dozens of them.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.193
Trucks with satellites.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.634
Their garbage...

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.951
Littered all over the place.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.794
How's Andrea?

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.552
She's disappointed.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.756
Just to leave our home,
she had to climb in the back seat

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.071
of one of your staffers.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.152
He threw an old blanket on our daughter.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.594
That's how she left the house,

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.512
like a criminal,
like she should be ashamed.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.274
No, these people should be ashamed, Lee.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.679
I mean, the public won't stand for it.
It's...

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.994
Right.

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.640
I'm so sorry.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.952
I can imagine you are.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.236
Were you thinking of me
when you were flirting with that girl?

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.470
Were you thinking of me on that boat

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.554
when you were making her laugh
in front of 50 other people?

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.873
Were you thinking of me
when you invited her into our home?

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.719
Are you leaving me?

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.799
Not now.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.272
Not yet.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.877
Yeah, maybe at some point.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.310
And that might feel like a burden,

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.791
and it should, because you hurt me,

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.874
and you need to feel it,
you need to know that.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.472
You feel it, you carry it,
so I don't have to.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.634
Do you think
you can ever accept my apology?

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.320
Excuse me.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.111
I will get to all of the questions

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.351
that you have,
and then hopefully tomorrow,

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.672
we can return
to the real business of this election.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.114
- Senator.
- Yes. Ann.

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.560
- Yeah, thank you, sir.
- Yes, Ann.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.875
Doesn't this episode

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.839
call your judgment as a leader
into question?

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.634
Yes, I suppose I have...

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.474
I've made some mistakes, but I think...

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.791
Judgment, like character,
needs to be measured

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.712
in the full context of a career,

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.190
and I think what
I've undertaken in the Senate

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.670
and the plans I've outlined
for the country also speak

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:31.796
to my judgment.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.029
David. Yes.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.456
How are you going to convince people
in the Democratic Party

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.915
that you are not going to make
this kind of mistake again?

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.471
By not making
this kind of mistake again.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.557
- Yes.
- Were there two people in the house?

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.433
Three people? Did they go and come back?

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.830
Alan, we've been through this.
It's on the record.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.073
There were three people
who came to my house

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.753
on the Saturday, late afternoon,

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.752
and over the course
of maybe two or three hours,

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.309
we left, we came back,
and then they moved on. Yes.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.874
Senator, you were once quoted
as saying that you love danger.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.077
Is that why you've put yourself
in this position?

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.436
I don't love it that much, Jack,
trust me.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.600
Yes.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.798
Senator Hart, what would you say
to the women voters of this country?

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.475
Well, I would say that,

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.517
if you speak to anyone
who's worked for me,

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.160
my campaign staff, anyone in the Senate,

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.074
over the last 15 to 20 years,
you'll find that I have

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.119
a very healthy relationship,
working relationship with women.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.393
You said there's no relationship.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:36.631
Are you willing to take
a lie detector test?

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.675
I think the voters are
a pretty good lie detector test.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.416
- Will they believe you?
- I think they do.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.636
The last poll I saw said
that most voters believe

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.120
the <i>Herald</i> was out of line.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.669
- More than 60%, in fact.
- 64%.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.536
Right. When the numbers are in
your favor, always be specific.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.630
Right?

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.354
Senator? Senator?

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.397
Mr. Parker.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.472
- Yes, Senator. Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.596
Good afternoon.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.875
Glad you could make it.

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.189
Yes.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.280
Yesterday in your speech,
you raised the issue of morality.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.395
I'd like to ask you, specifically,
what you meant by that.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:16.030
I have a series of questions,
if that's all right, if you don't mind.

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.356
All right.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.238
When you said you did nothing immoral,

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.789
were you referring to that
you had no sexual relationship

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.113
with Donna Rice last week
and/or at any other time?

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.176
Yeah, I've said
there was no relationship.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.429
That's correct.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:39.669
Do you believe adultery is immoral?

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.714
Do I...

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.757
Well, yes. Yes, I do.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.879
But, Senator...

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.354
Senator, have you
ever committed adultery?

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800
I...

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.519
Say it. Say it.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.395
Well...

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.115
I guess...

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.316
I guess I don't think
that that is a fair question.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.677
- Anyone for more coffee?
- It's early.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.955
Yeah, I'll have a cup.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.520
- Sir?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.037
- Ma'am?
- No, thank you.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.480
- Yeah, I'll have one, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.876
And, you, sir? Coffee?

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.234
Gary?

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.755
- You want a coffee?
- No.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.200
I need some time with the senator.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.959
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Come on.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.600
You know what?
I tried coke while I was at Berkeley,

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:16.434
and I cheated on my girlfriend. Twice.

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.920
Just to save you some time.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.356
Maybe we move up military reform.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.874
Yeah. We can do a big roll-out,

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.191
- get some generals on board.
- I need to call Andrea.

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.670
- Do you have a dime?
- I have one.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.194
Do you have change?

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.158
- Yeah. I have a quarter.
- Thank you.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.536
Look, I'm all for going back out there,
shaking more hands.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.240
It's just, at the moment, I don't think
we can get the senator to...

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.096
I don't think it's safe
to put him in front of a crowd.

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.696
We could call Denver,
get some more bodies.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.518
We can book some more TV time.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.616
I mean, how long would it take
to shoot a 30-minute spot?

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.199
Can we pay for that?

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.638
You know, it's, like, we go out there,
we go right to the voters.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.599
Irene, is there any...
Any word from Miami?

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.794
How do you mean?

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.032
Is she... Is she okay?

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.636
I don't know how you
want me to answer that.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.593
Congratulations.

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.879
You just became the <i>National Enquirer.</i>

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.633
You're 50 cents at the register.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:10.792
I'm just not sure
enough people would see it.

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.473
If the media's been talking about it...

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.680
We'd need a national buy.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.910
Where the fuck is Dixon?

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.480
It's outrageous.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.153
Okay, but you're safe?

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.150
Well...

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:41.356
They cannot hound you like this.
They will not hound you like this.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.359
You know what?
They shouldn't even be near you.

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.157
Okay, we will take care of this.

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.549
Lee.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.919
It's time to go home.

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.950
<i>Tonight, Gary Hart and his wife
are back in Denver,</i>

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.316
<i>where he will end
his latest run for the White House.</i>

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.517
<i>Once considered the man to beat in '88,</i>

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.832
<i>Hart plans to end his candidacy
in a formal announcement at noon.</i>

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.320
Senator Hart, will you
be leaving the campaign?

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.670
<i>Well, clearly,</i>

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.753
<i>under present circumstances,
this campaign cannot go on.</i>

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:16.632
<i>I refuse to submit
my family and my friends</i>

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.518
<i>to further rumors and gossip.</i>

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.795
<i>I don't want to be the issue,</i>

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.793
<i>and I cannot be the issue.</i>

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.751
<i>If you're gonna
have to spend all your time</i>

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.035
<i>talking about yourself</i>

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:34.840
<i>and you're not particularly
good at that anyway,</i>

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.919
<i>then you can't maintain
the link with the voters.</i>

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.070
<i>In public life,
some things may be interesting,</i>

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.232
<i>but that doesn't necessarily
mean they're important.</i>

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.833
<i>And the farmers in Amarillo,</i>

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.879
<i>the oil field workers in Louisiana,</i>

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.429
<i>the steelworkers in Pennsylvania,</i>

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.477
<i>they wantjobs.</i>

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.473
<i>Their kids want an education,
and like all the rest of us,</i>

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.519
<i>they don't want to be killed
by some nuclear weapon.</i>

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.314
Now, we're all gonna have
to seriously question the system

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.790
we have for electing
our national leaders,

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.395
that has reporters in bushes,

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.473
photographers peeking in our windows,

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.758
that reduces the press of this nation
into the hunters

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.351
and the presidential candidates
into the hunted,

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.831
after which ponderous pundits
wonder in mock seriousness

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:30.151
as to why
some of the best people in this country

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.038
choose not to run for high office.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.239
Now, politics in this country,

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.040
take it from me,
is on the verge of becoming

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.715
another form of athletic competition,
or sport.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.957
We'd all better do something
to make this system work,

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.351
or we're all soon gonna be
rephrasing Jefferson to say,

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.672
"I tremble for my country
when I fear we may, in fact,

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:56.594
"get the kind of leaders we deserve."

01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.475
<i>I've said I bend, but I do not break.</i>

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.632
<i>And believe me, I'm not broken.</i>

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.996
<i>I say to my children,</i>

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.118
<i>and the young people of this country,</i>

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.793
<i>I'm angry, too.</i>

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.397
<i>I've made some mistakes. I said so.</i>

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:16.040
<i>I said I would because I'm human.</i>

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.279
<i>But I'm an idealist,</i>

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.912
<i>and I want to serve my country.</i>

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.029
<i>Events of the past week
should not deter any of you</i>

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.794

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.512
<i>The torch of idealism
in your hearts burns bright.</i>

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.992
<i>It should lead you to want
to make this country better.</i>

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.399
<i>Wherever you go, whatever you do,</i>

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.439
<i>at least in spirit I will be with you.</i>

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.840
<i>Thank you.</i>
