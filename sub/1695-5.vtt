<i>Hello?</i>

- Willie: <i>Uncle Nucky.</i>
- <i>Willie?</i>

03:01.347 --> 03:03.282
Willie:
<i>How are you?</i>

03:03.316 --> 03:05.183
Nucky:
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

03:05.201 --> 03:06.685
Willie:
<i>Philadelphia.</i>

03:06.703 --> 03:09.204
<i>I'm in philadelphia and...</i>

03:09.239 --> 03:13.458
Nucky:
<i>Willie, is something wrong?</i>

03:13.493 --> 03:15.544
Willie:
<i>I need your help.</i>

03:15.578 --> 03:18.363
( chirping )

03:20.366 --> 03:22.501
Nucky:
<i>Eddie!</i>

03:27.707 --> 03:30.559
<i>Eddie, are you up there?</i>

03:37.717 --> 03:39.685
<i>Eddie.</i>

03:41.604 --> 03:43.906
- <i>Eddie?</i>
- <i>( knocks )</i>

03:44.941 --> 03:47.058
Tom:
<i>Mr. Thompson.</i>

03:48.411 --> 03:50.913
- Have you seen him today?
- <i>No.</i>

03:58.121 --> 04:00.372
Bring the car around.
Make it quick.

04:11.601 --> 04:13.685
Would you like some?

04:15.421 --> 04:17.755
You can say yes
or no.

04:17.774 --> 04:20.358
Doesn't obligate you
to anything.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.763
No, thank you.

04:24.781 --> 04:27.115
You're welcome.

04:27.150 --> 04:29.117
Sounds funny,
doesn't it?

04:29.152 --> 04:31.536
- How's that?
- He said, "no, thank you."

04:31.571 --> 04:33.956
I said, "you're welcome."
doesn't sound right.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.875
Uh...

04:36.909 --> 04:38.627
Sound right to you?

04:39.662 --> 04:41.630
You do not say
"you're welcome"

04:41.664 --> 04:44.049
When someone says
"no, thank you."

04:44.083 --> 04:45.500
Why?

04:45.551 --> 04:49.471
Because they have not
accepted anything from you.

04:49.505 --> 04:51.723
His english
is better than yours.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.675
Heck, I guess it is.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.143
Where did you learn it?

04:55.178 --> 04:59.297
Did you study it over in prussia,
I guess you would have called it?

04:59.315 --> 05:00.983
Why am I here?

05:01.017 --> 05:03.134
- Why do you think you're here?
- I do not know.

05:03.152 --> 05:05.988
People don't get hauled off the
street for no reason, do they?

05:08.974 --> 05:11.526
Do they get hauled off
the street for no reason?

05:11.577 --> 05:13.362
I am not a policeman.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.615
- No one thinks you're a policeman.
- We're the policemen.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.484
I have done nothing wrong.

05:19.502 --> 05:20.819
You had a pistol
up your sleeve.

05:20.837 --> 05:23.505
- That is for protection.
- Against who?

05:26.209 --> 05:28.043
Apaches.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.296
What do you think
we should do?

05:31.330 --> 05:33.164
Don't see
what choice we have.

05:34.183 --> 05:37.335
Darn it.
Darn it to heck.

05:38.721 --> 05:40.522
Yeah.

05:52.017 --> 05:53.702
I may leave?

06:02.328 --> 06:04.579
- You almost fell.
- I am fine.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.030
You don't look fine.

06:06.049 --> 06:08.500
You look very unsteady.

06:09.719 --> 06:12.220
I think you should
stay here for a while.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.593
For your own good.

06:21.213 --> 06:23.065
Give bill pflaum the broom

06:23.099 --> 06:25.734
And he'll sweep
cicero clean.

06:25.768 --> 06:27.686
Stand beside bill,

06:27.720 --> 06:30.889
And he'll
stand up for you.

06:30.907 --> 06:33.775
A straight town
is a healthy town.

06:33.826 --> 06:37.496
Healthy for your family
and healthy for you.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.914
So let's shake hands...

06:38.948 --> 06:42.501
Why must they disturb
the people so early?

06:42.535 --> 06:43.919
It's election day, dear.

06:43.953 --> 06:45.504
They have the right
to campaign.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.739
They should not make
so much fuss

06:47.757 --> 06:49.240
And do what they are told.

06:49.258 --> 06:51.760
That wouldn't be
very democratic.

06:51.794 --> 06:54.963
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>is talking always.</i>

06:55.014 --> 06:57.015
Everybody has the opinion.

06:57.049 --> 07:00.135
- Nothing gets done.
- Dada.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.755
- He must eat.
- He doesn't want any more.

07:03.773 --> 07:06.441
He does not know
what he wants.

07:06.476 --> 07:08.593
<i>( car horn honking )</i>

07:11.948 --> 07:14.533
Your friends
have returned.

07:28.131 --> 07:30.298
Built this
whole thing yourself?

07:30.333 --> 07:32.116
The rosetta model.

07:33.553 --> 07:37.288
Put some grass down there.
Spruce it up.

07:37.306 --> 07:39.624
That's the summer project.

07:39.642 --> 07:42.477
<i>( whistle blows )</i>

07:43.963 --> 07:45.630
Time for
the morning shift.

07:45.648 --> 07:47.933
Let's go, george.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.134
Gonna be a good day.

08:02.865 --> 08:05.817
<i>( wings fluttering )</i>

08:29.308 --> 08:31.359
How are you, will?

08:31.394 --> 08:34.062
I'm okay.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.981
A little shaken?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.400
No, I'm--

08:38.451 --> 08:40.869
Yeah.

08:42.488 --> 08:44.022
We'll sort this out.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.075
That's the first thing
you need to know.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.793
Do my parents--

08:48.828 --> 08:51.362
Right now
this is between us.

08:51.380 --> 08:54.299
I'm gonna do my best
to keep it that way.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.052
They haven't charged you yet.
That's very good.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.338
Why can't I leave?

09:02.091 --> 09:05.209
There are reporters upstairs
living in the lobby

09:05.228 --> 09:07.045
Just looking
for something to do.

09:08.397 --> 09:11.382
You can walk out of here
a suspect in a capital case.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.435
They'll smell that
in a second.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.488
Or you can walk out like someone
who just paid a parking ticket.

09:16.522 --> 09:18.389
That's what we want.

09:18.407 --> 09:20.391
You need to give me
a little time.

09:20.409 --> 09:22.444
But you--

09:22.495 --> 09:26.081
You know people
in philadelphia, right?

09:26.115 --> 09:29.334
I do and I'll call
on them.

09:29.401 --> 09:31.235
If that's what's required.

09:31.254 --> 09:34.072
I'll make it up to you.
I swear.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.124
Don't worry
about that now.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.576
Let's talk about
this boy.

09:38.594 --> 09:40.578
I didn't have
anything to do with it.

09:40.596 --> 09:43.548
Let's just talk
about him for a minute.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.418
<i>( faint music playing )</i>

09:49.221 --> 09:50.972
Now, now.

09:51.807 --> 09:53.942
Now, now.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.368
Hotel arlington.

10:04.654 --> 10:08.106
Yes, mr. Roy phillips,
please.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.910
I beg your pardon?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.713
I don't see how that's
any of your concern.

10:19.051 --> 10:22.304
How do I know he hasn't arrived
since the last time I--

10:23.472 --> 10:27.425
Yes.
The same message.

10:40.072 --> 10:42.774
It's all right.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.192
Hey.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.945
- Hey, boss.
- Frank: <i>Clear a path, boys.</i>

10:46.979 --> 10:48.813
- Hey, frank.
- Morning.

10:48.831 --> 10:50.982
- How's it going, boss?
- Frank.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.651
So I heard pflaum caught
a couple last night.

10:53.669 --> 10:55.870
No, they just capped
his knees.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.622
I don't know
nothing about that.

10:57.656 --> 11:00.158
What about the guy that got
his throat cut on 22nd?

11:00.176 --> 11:01.543
His whole throat?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.712
- Nah, only to here.
- ( men laugh )

11:03.763 --> 11:05.296
So he can still
whistle, huh?

11:05.330 --> 11:07.182
( men laugh )

11:07.216 --> 11:09.601
That's a good one, frank.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.270
Let's check in
on his highness.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.838
( knocks )

11:13.856 --> 11:16.224
( snorting )

11:18.027 --> 11:20.178
What are you doing?

11:20.196 --> 11:22.647
Training my flea circus.
What do you think?

11:24.700 --> 11:25.984
Frank:
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>give it a break?</i>

11:26.018 --> 11:28.036
What, like you ain't
been touching it?

11:29.405 --> 11:31.206
We got business today.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.041
( snorting )

11:33.075 --> 11:35.526
What'd I just say?

11:35.544 --> 11:37.579
Don't do that.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.532
Al:
<i>What, you think</i>
<i>I'm kidding?</i>

11:41.550 --> 11:44.636
Put that thing away.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.704
What the fuck's
he doing here?

11:46.722 --> 11:48.923
You asked for him,
garibaldi.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.393
<i>You liked the way</i>
<i>he handled himself</i>
<i>last night.</i>

11:51.427 --> 11:52.677
I did?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.681
The woods!

11:56.715 --> 11:59.184
Daniel fucking crockett.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.486
Pow!

12:01.520 --> 12:03.905
( mocking )
"you'd better run."

12:03.989 --> 12:06.557
( laughs )

12:06.575 --> 12:09.494
Hey, george,
you know what day it is?

12:09.528 --> 12:11.946
- Election day.
- <i>April fools'.</i>

12:11.997 --> 12:15.283
All the suckers,
they're gonna find out
that the joke's on them.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.751
You know who that includes?

12:16.786 --> 12:18.503
- I don't.
- <i>Guess.</i>

12:18.537 --> 12:20.422
- I can't.
- He likes flowers.

12:20.456 --> 12:22.957
- Mr. O'banion.
- ( laughs )

12:23.008 --> 12:25.427
Listen to him.

12:25.461 --> 12:27.929
Come here.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.301
Closer.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.353
Come on.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.273
I won't hurt you.

12:43.112 --> 12:45.313
You done bad things.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.532
I saw you.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.567
So have you.

12:49.601 --> 12:53.288
Yes, I have.
But not to the guy
I work for.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.609
You got a little
wild streak.

12:58.627 --> 13:00.611
Huh?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.251
Let's see
how you do today.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.452
<i>Then we'll talk.</i>

13:10.005 --> 13:12.841
'cause there's some
unfinished business
with the florist.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.843
Leave all that for later.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.794
Al.

13:18.347 --> 13:20.682
Go out there,
pick the 20 best men
you can find,

13:20.733 --> 13:22.967
Take them over
to the main gate
at western electric.

13:22.985 --> 13:25.687
Help the voters
make up their minds.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.238
You with us?

13:27.273 --> 13:28.823
He needs
to ask his wife.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.575
I don't need to ask
anyone anything.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.745
Ooh.
( laughs )

13:33.779 --> 13:35.530
I think he wants
to bite me.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.816
Respect the boundaries, huh?

13:42.505 --> 13:44.923
Still got that piece?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.659
You mean this?

13:48.677 --> 13:49.994
Hold on.

13:50.012 --> 13:53.047
Shouldn't be
any need, but...

13:53.098 --> 13:55.517
Are you okay, then?

13:58.837 --> 14:00.171
Hey!

14:01.190 --> 14:02.840
Perk yourself up.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.861
I'm fine right now.

14:06.896 --> 14:09.230
Don't you want
to be my friend?

14:11.901 --> 14:13.851
( snorts )

14:13.869 --> 14:17.355
Yeah!
Who's gonna fuck
with us, huh?

14:17.373 --> 14:19.874
Huh?
( growls )

14:19.909 --> 14:21.459
Willie:
<i>We had a party.</i>

14:21.493 --> 14:22.860
Nucky:
<i>Who's we?</i>

14:22.878 --> 14:24.746
Just the fellas,

14:24.797 --> 14:26.998
My roommate
clayton and me.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.717
- Some girls.
- Uh-huh.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.586
There was liquor.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.704
Where'd that come from?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.593
Will, you need
to tell me.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.678
It was...

14:40.712 --> 14:42.713
Mr. Doyle.

14:42.731 --> 14:45.567
Mickey sold you liquor?

14:51.523 --> 14:53.691
Why didn't you come to me?

14:53.725 --> 14:56.227
I didn't want you to know.

14:56.245 --> 14:58.446
But I know now.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.731
You see, will?

15:00.749 --> 15:02.784
The liquor came from me.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.069
I didn't know, and now
there's a problem.

15:05.087 --> 15:06.955
I'm sorry.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.424
I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.126
<i>All right,</i>
<i>mickey sold you liquor.</i>

15:12.177 --> 15:13.577
You brought it
back to school.

15:13.596 --> 15:15.246
It was just a party.

15:15.264 --> 15:17.882
Everybody was having
a good time.

15:17.916 --> 15:21.185
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>henry was--</i>

15:21.220 --> 15:23.754
He wasn't moving.

15:25.474 --> 15:27.258
I don't know.

15:28.593 --> 15:30.261
Did he drink a lot?

15:30.279 --> 15:32.063
As much as anyone else.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.099
- <i>But he was</i>
<i>the only one who--</i>
- yes.

15:35.117 --> 15:37.068
How well did you know him?

15:37.102 --> 15:38.820
I didn't.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.738
I thought he was
your friend.

15:40.772 --> 15:42.106
What?

15:42.124 --> 15:45.209
When we had dinner,
you called him a friend.

15:47.913 --> 15:51.582
I don't have a lot of
friends here, uncle Nucky.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.640
I'm going to talk
to the district attorney.

15:58.674 --> 16:01.476
If he's just fishing,
then I'll know it

16:01.510 --> 16:03.344
And it all goes away.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.514
What you have to do
is pull yourself together

16:06.565 --> 16:08.816
And remember the truth.

16:08.851 --> 16:11.569
Let me ask you again,

16:11.603 --> 16:13.688
Was henry your friend?

16:17.142 --> 16:19.027
Yes.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.245
How much did he drink?

16:21.280 --> 16:23.614
A lot.

16:23.648 --> 16:26.117
Where'd you get
the liquor?

16:26.151 --> 16:28.836
I didn't bring
any liquor.

16:35.544 --> 16:36.794
Good.

16:36.828 --> 16:38.963
Man:
<i>Following an inspection</i>
<i>of your domicile,</i>

16:38.997 --> 16:41.766
<i>The officer will submit</i>
<i>a report--</i>

16:41.800 --> 16:44.135
<i>Mrs. Darmody?</i>

16:44.169 --> 16:46.888
Mrs. Darmody,
are you all right?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.523
You're looking
a bit peaked.

16:48.557 --> 16:50.892
I didn't sleep
last night.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.560
I'm sorry to hear it.

16:52.611 --> 16:55.146
I wake up and I think,

16:55.180 --> 16:57.148
"must check on tommy."

16:57.182 --> 16:59.683
- I'm out of bed
and I realize--
- <i>yes.</i>

16:59.702 --> 17:02.520
<i>I realize he's not there.</i>

17:02.538 --> 17:05.073
And there's no
getting back to sleep.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.857
Not at all.

17:09.044 --> 17:11.628
After the officer
submits a report,

17:11.663 --> 17:13.798
<i>The court will make</i>
<i>its final determination</i>

17:13.832 --> 17:15.550
<i>Regarding the question</i>
<i>of custody.</i>

17:15.584 --> 17:16.917
What do I have to do?

17:16.969 --> 17:18.368
You don't have
to do anything.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.838
What the officer will be
looking for is a true picture

17:20.872 --> 17:22.839
Of the home the boy
would be returning to.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.875
I'm in a period
of transition.

17:24.893 --> 17:26.761
A great deal
of the furniture--

17:26.811 --> 17:28.730
The furniture
is not important.

17:29.765 --> 17:31.733
A gentleman
I've been seeing,

17:31.767 --> 17:35.153
He's highly placed in
an important national firm.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.988
A great deal
of responsibility.

17:37.022 --> 17:39.323
He'd prefer not to have
that bandied about.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.359
He prides himself
on discretion.

17:41.393 --> 17:45.729
And his taste
in decor is...

17:51.920 --> 17:55.123
May I trouble you
for a glass of water?

18:08.887 --> 18:11.255
Oh!

18:11.273 --> 18:13.391
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.027
- It's all right.
- I don't know what's
wrong with me today.

18:16.061 --> 18:19.447
( winces )
oh, dear.

18:19.481 --> 18:21.149
Here.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.533
Clench it tight
for a minute.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.819
I must look
quite a horror.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.788
Not at all.

18:26.822 --> 18:28.939
I'm just in such a state.

18:28.957 --> 18:32.460
You reach a point in life
and you realize it's what you
leave behind that matters.

18:32.494 --> 18:35.329
And the thought that tommy
might not remember me at all,

18:35.380 --> 18:37.298
As if I never
even existed.

18:37.332 --> 18:39.783
Best to take it
one step at a time.

18:39.802 --> 18:42.220
Is there anything I can do
to help my situation?

18:42.254 --> 18:45.223
- As I explained--
- I mean right now.

18:48.177 --> 18:53.014
Is there anything
I can do right now?

18:57.069 --> 19:00.238
- Mrs. Darmody.
- Yes?

19:02.474 --> 19:05.159
It would be in
your best interest

19:05.194 --> 19:07.811
To leave these chambers
immediately.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.671
I'm late
for an appointment.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.834
Mr. Thompson.
Eugene mulhearne.

19:30.853 --> 19:33.137
I'm an assistant
district attorney.
How do you do?

19:33.171 --> 19:35.673
Mr. Mulhearne, you're not
who I want to see.

19:35.691 --> 19:37.642
The district attorney
asked me to meet with you

19:37.676 --> 19:39.343
And answer any questions
you might have.

19:39.361 --> 19:44.031
- Why isn't he here?
- He had other obligations,
regretfully.

19:48.036 --> 19:50.988
- You fellows
are making a mistake.
- How's that?

19:51.022 --> 19:53.074
Trying to turn a quirk
of fate into what?

19:53.125 --> 19:54.492
A manslaughter charge?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.411
10 separate witnesses say he
brought liquor to that party.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.330
Is that really worth
your time and effort?

19:59.364 --> 20:01.365
If that boy was poisoned,
then yes.

20:01.383 --> 20:03.384
Where are you
getting that from?

20:03.418 --> 20:04.969
His symptoms are consistent
with poisoning.

20:05.003 --> 20:08.506
- <i>Alcohol poisoning.</i>
- That's not what
the coroner says.

20:09.808 --> 20:12.176
What's that got
to do with my nephew?

20:12.210 --> 20:14.679
This office intends
to find out.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.899
Let's cut the bullshit.
Your boss and waxey gordon

20:17.933 --> 20:21.018
Had a conversation
this morning at my request

20:21.052 --> 20:22.937
<i>And it was agreed</i>
<i>that this occurrence,</i>

20:22.988 --> 20:26.557
Terrible as it was,
isn't anybody's fault.

20:27.743 --> 20:29.226
That couple outside,

20:29.244 --> 20:31.412
They're henry
gaines's parents.

20:31.446 --> 20:33.497
Mr. Gaines is a major
contributor

20:33.532 --> 20:35.399
To the pennsylvania
republican party.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.335
<i>He's lost his son</i>

20:37.369 --> 20:41.088
And he doesn't want
to hear about life's
random misfortunes.

20:41.123 --> 20:43.257
Someone's got
to answer for this.

20:43.292 --> 20:45.909
<i>We just don't have</i>
<i>any choice.</i>

20:55.437 --> 20:57.888
- How are we keeping?
- I am fine.

20:57.922 --> 20:59.923
You are fine.

20:59.942 --> 21:02.310
I admire that kind
of backbone.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.145
Does he know
how tough you are?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.613
Who?

21:05.647 --> 21:07.615
<i>Your boss,</i>
<i>mr. Thompson.</i>

21:09.601 --> 21:13.120
I understand.
Good soldier.

21:13.155 --> 21:15.539
<i>Really, the more I see</i>
<i>of you, the more I like.</i>

21:15.574 --> 21:18.492
But let me ask this--

21:18.543 --> 21:20.461
Would he do
the same for you?

21:20.495 --> 21:22.663
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

21:27.502 --> 21:29.553
You've been here
all day, eddie.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.288
No one's asked for you.

21:31.306 --> 21:34.291
Not on the boardwalk,
not over at the onyx club,

21:34.309 --> 21:36.627
Not in the speaks
or the wire rooms.

21:36.645 --> 21:39.513
The world is going on
without you.

21:39.564 --> 21:42.650
Nucky thompson
is going on without you.

21:42.684 --> 21:46.437
And the only person
who really cares what
happens to you right now

21:46.471 --> 21:49.139
Is me.

21:51.326 --> 21:53.277
You are my friend?

21:53.311 --> 21:54.978
No, I am not.

21:54.997 --> 21:57.314
Then who are you?

21:59.034 --> 22:01.669
( groans )

22:04.206 --> 22:06.657
- That's who I am.
- <i>( coughs )</i>

22:06.675 --> 22:09.326
And I'm going to own
every last bit of you.

22:09.344 --> 22:11.512
( coughing )

22:21.223 --> 22:23.024
Clean yourself up.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.515
Nucky:
<i>Who was henry gaines?</i>

22:31.533 --> 22:32.983
He was a friend of mine.

22:33.017 --> 22:35.036
Who brought the liquor?

22:35.070 --> 22:36.687
Beats me.

22:36.705 --> 22:38.456
How much
did henry drink?

22:38.490 --> 22:39.623
A lot.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.043
Who slipped him
the mickey?

22:42.077 --> 22:43.694
The what?

22:43.712 --> 22:45.963
The mickey finn.
The knockout punch.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.049
Whatever was in there.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.718
I-- I don't, uh--

22:50.752 --> 22:53.637
Willie, I have to ask you
not to lie just now.

22:53.672 --> 22:56.707
It won't help.
And frankly,
I don't like it.

22:56.725 --> 22:58.375
I need to know
what's true

22:58.427 --> 23:01.211
So we can
agree on the rest.
Understood?

23:07.486 --> 23:10.071
It was supposed
to be a gag.

23:10.105 --> 23:12.556
That's all.

23:12.574 --> 23:14.942
Whose idea was it?

23:16.194 --> 23:18.028
Mine.

23:18.062 --> 23:20.230
Just yours?

23:23.452 --> 23:25.536
Willie.

23:27.238 --> 23:29.206
Clayton helped me.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.092
Your roommate?

23:32.243 --> 23:33.961
And henry?

23:34.012 --> 23:37.047
What did he do
to deserve it?

23:40.135 --> 23:42.970
He thought
he was better than me.

23:43.021 --> 23:45.106
But he wasn't.

23:48.110 --> 23:49.927
All right.

23:49.945 --> 23:52.980
Here's what I'm going
to need you to do.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.599
Factory gates are there,

23:55.617 --> 23:57.651
Polling booth
down that way.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.737
You know the situation.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.606
Make sure they vote
for klenha

24:02.624 --> 24:04.274
Or don't vote at all.

24:04.292 --> 24:06.777
Most people,
they don't want trouble.

24:06.795 --> 24:09.330
Who's the mayor,
who's the president,

24:09.381 --> 24:10.965
What's it to them?

24:10.999 --> 24:13.000
We'll run this burg.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.451
Keep the green flowing.

24:14.469 --> 24:15.953
That's all anyone
cares about.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.421
And o'banion?

24:17.455 --> 24:19.423
Lots of ways
to do business.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.458
See how it plays out.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.814
Got the piece?

24:26.848 --> 24:28.182
Right here.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.934
Then hop to it.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.354
Hey.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.639
Don't worry about
my brother, okay?

24:35.657 --> 24:38.108
Sometimes he just needs
a good kick in the ass.

24:38.142 --> 24:39.944
Who's gonna do
the kicking?

24:46.368 --> 24:48.419
It's an advance.

24:50.705 --> 24:52.089
Stick with me, huh?

24:52.123 --> 24:54.675
I'll put grass
on your fucking lawn.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.179
I'm ready.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.400
Hello.

25:29.628 --> 25:32.796
There's no reason
for this to get out of hand.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.032
All we need to do
is remind them

25:35.050 --> 25:38.419
Why it's in their own
best interest to elect
the republican ticket.

25:40.639 --> 25:43.891
As each worker goes by,
I want you to inquire

25:43.925 --> 25:46.543
- How he intends to vote.
- Inquire?

25:46.561 --> 25:48.045
They already know
what can happen

25:48.063 --> 25:51.015
And most people
don't want trouble.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.683
I didn't come out
for no tea social.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.052
- Al says give it to 'em good.
- Al's not in charge here.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.887
- I am.
- You ain't in charge
of nothing.

25:56.905 --> 25:59.773
Man:
<i>I say we pick the first</i>
<i>guy and clobber him.</i>

25:59.824 --> 26:02.443
- We're doing it my way.
- Or what?

26:09.701 --> 26:11.452
Go ahead and try.

26:14.422 --> 26:17.207
<i>( whistle blows )</i>

26:22.264 --> 26:23.847
- Coming through.
- Coming through here.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.684
- Who you voting for today?
- None of your damn business.

26:26.718 --> 26:30.104
- Voting republican, friend?
- What's it to you?

26:30.138 --> 26:32.556
Got a minute?

26:33.775 --> 26:35.726
Hold on there.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.795
I'm talking to you.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.647
Just stop for a second,
god damn it!

26:41.900 --> 26:44.702
- ( grunts )
- ( men shouting )

26:44.736 --> 26:47.071
Move back!
Move back!

26:50.742 --> 26:53.544
Come on.
Johnny, go, go!
Let's go, let's go!

26:56.614 --> 26:58.632
You see, none of this
had to happen.

26:58.667 --> 27:01.585
Man:
<i>Move, move!</i>
<i>Let me in! Let me in!</i>

27:03.888 --> 27:06.090
Man #2:
<i>Get inside!</i>

27:07.976 --> 27:10.344
- <i>( men chatting, laughing )</i>
- <i>( music playing )</i>

27:12.981 --> 27:15.099
<i>( chatting stops )</i>

27:17.185 --> 27:19.320
<i>( man coughs )</i>

27:31.199 --> 27:33.200
I, uh...

27:33.251 --> 27:35.035
I'm looking
for someone.

27:35.086 --> 27:36.837
I don't know his name,

27:36.871 --> 27:39.790
But I'm told
he could be found here.

27:52.971 --> 27:56.390
I realize
we've never met before.

27:56.441 --> 28:01.195
This is probably
not how you normally
conduct business,

28:01.229 --> 28:02.980
But I made some inquires.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.982
Here I am.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.950
You far from home,
bo peep.

28:06.985 --> 28:09.153
Nothing is very far
from anything here.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.654
Is it?

28:10.688 --> 28:13.907
You're gonna take
the skin off.

28:18.997 --> 28:20.714
Who sent you around?

28:20.749 --> 28:21.882
Does that matter?

28:21.916 --> 28:25.052
<i>I like to know where</i>
<i>my customers come from.</i>

28:25.086 --> 28:28.005
I spent several years
on the stage.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.556
Do tell.

28:29.591 --> 28:33.260
- You know
how show people are.
- How are they?

28:33.311 --> 28:35.813
We like to keep our ears
close to the ground.

28:35.847 --> 28:39.433
Well, what you got
tucked up your little
pouch there?

28:40.518 --> 28:43.053
May I examine
the preparation first?

28:43.071 --> 28:45.072
No, you mayn't.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.463
That's all I've got.

29:09.514 --> 29:12.516
Then you find that
lost sheep somewhere else.

29:14.135 --> 29:18.605
Perhaps we could discuss
another form of payment?

29:26.815 --> 29:30.734
I'm having
a difficult day, mr...?

29:32.070 --> 29:36.073
- Oxford.
- Mr. Oxford.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.375
A very difficult day.

29:38.409 --> 29:39.960
Just one of those times

29:39.994 --> 29:42.445
When you need
a little extra help.

29:42.464 --> 29:44.614
That's all this is.

30:11.192 --> 30:13.243
You best go easy now,
little bo.

30:13.278 --> 30:16.530
I like my lambs
keep coming home.

30:19.617 --> 30:22.652
Where I went?

30:22.670 --> 30:25.839
State normal
over in trenton.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.675
Your aunt mabel
was there.

30:28.710 --> 30:31.795
She was going
to be a teacher.

30:31.829 --> 30:34.598
I didn't like the idea
of other fellas

30:34.632 --> 30:36.433
Helping her
with the classwork.

30:36.467 --> 30:39.002
So I thought
I'd be a teacher, too.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.438
Why didn't you?

30:41.472 --> 30:43.357
The commodore needed me.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.227
And I came back home.

30:48.512 --> 30:50.647
There are more important
things than what may

30:50.681 --> 30:53.901
Or may not have
happened at some party.

30:54.903 --> 30:56.353
My father won't know?

30:56.371 --> 30:58.155
No one will know.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.374
<i>( door opens )</i>

31:03.194 --> 31:06.129
Mr. Thompson.
Lawrence eisley.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.131
Mr. District attorney.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.583
Thanks for making
the time.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.502
- Sorry for
the mix-up earlier.
- Not to worry.

31:12.536 --> 31:14.838
But I'm sure you can
appreciate my concern.

31:14.872 --> 31:17.257
Oh, I'd feel the same way
if it was my nephew.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.927
We want to get this
cleared up before it
turns into something.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.045
I completely understand.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.521
Well, young man,

31:31.555 --> 31:33.657
I'm told you might
be able to help us

31:33.691 --> 31:36.493
With this
unfortunate event.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.495
Nucky:
You just tell them
what happened

31:38.529 --> 31:41.114
As best you remember it.

31:50.574 --> 31:53.210
First thing
I want to say is...

31:54.596 --> 31:57.514
Henry gaines
was a pal of mine.

31:57.548 --> 32:01.018
<i>( bell ringing )</i>

32:01.052 --> 32:04.054
( children chatting )

32:05.723 --> 32:07.774
Teacher:
<i>No running.</i>

32:07.809 --> 32:10.193
<i>We are ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen here.</i>

32:10.228 --> 32:14.314
<i>Tommy, I've told you time</i>
<i>and time again, walking.</i>

32:14.365 --> 32:15.932
Darling.

32:15.950 --> 32:18.935
It's me.
It's mima.

32:18.953 --> 32:22.906
Look at you.
You're a beautiful
little man.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.108
I'm going to
kiss you hello.

32:25.126 --> 32:26.793
May I do that?

32:31.749 --> 32:34.584
Are you learning
a lot here?

32:34.618 --> 32:36.470
That makes mima
so happy

32:36.504 --> 32:39.256
Because she wants you
to be smart.

32:39.290 --> 32:43.593
She wants you
to be the smartest boy
there ever was.

32:43.627 --> 32:46.763
Now, there's something
I have to tell you.

32:46.797 --> 32:49.266
I met a man.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.268
A very sweet man.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.186
His name is roy.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.305
I think you're going
to like him.

32:55.323 --> 32:57.607
We're all going
to be together

32:57.641 --> 33:00.694
And that's going
to make us so happy.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.496
Won't that be nice?

33:04.648 --> 33:07.701
All right.
All right.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.837
I have something for you.

33:10.872 --> 33:13.507
It's--
here it is.

33:13.541 --> 33:17.210
It's an abba-zaba.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.346
( laughs )
I don't know
what that is,

33:19.380 --> 33:21.014
But I'm sure
it's wonderful.

33:21.049 --> 33:22.999
And it's for you.

33:23.017 --> 33:25.218
And we're going home now.

33:25.269 --> 33:27.354
It's all been
taken care of.

33:27.388 --> 33:30.190
You're going
to come home with--

33:30.224 --> 33:32.359
With me.

33:33.394 --> 33:35.028
Hello, julia.

33:36.013 --> 33:38.065
How are you?

33:38.116 --> 33:40.150
I'm very well.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.119
Are these
your relations?

33:42.153 --> 33:43.704
They're teachers.

33:43.788 --> 33:46.289
Of course they are.

33:47.525 --> 33:50.043
- Well, then...
- What are you doing here?

33:50.128 --> 33:51.661
Just bringing tommy home.

33:51.695 --> 33:53.046
He doesn't live
with you anymore.

33:53.081 --> 33:55.832
Now, julia, that's for
the judge to decide.

33:55.866 --> 33:59.469
We had a chat today
and he was very forthcoming.

34:00.671 --> 34:03.090
Come on, sweetie.
I'm here.

34:04.926 --> 34:06.709
No, no.

34:07.929 --> 34:10.063
This isn't proper.

34:10.098 --> 34:13.433
It's a beautiful day
and this isn't proper.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.885
We're going
to walk this way.

34:15.902 --> 34:19.106
Okay?
And we're not
looking back.

34:23.411 --> 34:25.078
- This way, ma'am.
- Let go of me.

34:25.112 --> 34:26.612
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let go of me.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.114
- You don't have the right.
- Now, please.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.733
You can't just bleach me out
like a laundry stain.

34:30.752 --> 34:32.335
- <i>Let go of me.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

34:32.370 --> 34:35.255
I have to give him
the abba-zaba.

34:35.339 --> 34:37.456
<i>( music playing )</i>

34:44.348 --> 34:46.382
Here it is.

34:48.469 --> 34:50.603
Not bad.

34:50.638 --> 34:53.607
It's okay.
Ma put up the curtains.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.110
Can you play this?

34:57.145 --> 34:59.279
Not really.

34:59.313 --> 35:02.232
You need to find yourself
a girl to serenade.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.317
Give you an incentive.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.656
Shut the door
for a minute, will.

35:15.830 --> 35:17.947
- Uncle Nucky--
- No lecture.

35:17.999 --> 35:20.283
Just a few things
I want to say.

35:31.429 --> 35:34.648
Whatever occurred,
it's over.

35:35.983 --> 35:38.235
But every now and then
you'll think

35:38.269 --> 35:40.987
About the terrible thing
that happened to a boy

35:41.022 --> 35:43.440
Whose face
you can't quite remember.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.493
I promise,
you can live with it.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.246
Is that what you do?

35:50.248 --> 35:52.449
You're going to graduate.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.584
We'll get you
into another school

35:54.619 --> 35:57.287
If that's what's
necessary.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.589
It's not important now.

35:59.624 --> 36:02.825
You worry about what
other people might say.

36:02.844 --> 36:06.046
You worry about someone
you call a friend.

36:06.130 --> 36:09.432
None of that matters.

36:09.467 --> 36:12.769
The only thing
you can count on is blood.

36:12.803 --> 36:15.222
The blood
that's in your veins

36:15.273 --> 36:17.224
And the blood
that's in mine.

36:17.275 --> 36:20.360
<i>The people</i>
<i>who discount you,</i>

36:20.394 --> 36:23.113
<i>They don't know</i>
<i>who you are.</i>

36:23.147 --> 36:26.483
The rage you feel--
listen to me careful--

36:26.517 --> 36:29.953
<i>It's a gift.</i>

36:29.987 --> 36:32.188
Use it.

36:32.206 --> 36:35.024
But don't let
anyone see it.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.829
<i>Know that</i>
<i>I'm watching over you.</i>

36:39.863 --> 36:42.699
Show me the person
you intend to be.

36:50.892 --> 36:53.643
How much did you pay
the district attorney?

36:55.146 --> 36:58.047
One day we'll talk
about all that.

36:58.065 --> 37:02.319
Right now,
you just need to stick
to what we discussed

37:02.353 --> 37:04.521
<i>And not worry</i>
<i>about the rest.</i>

37:04.555 --> 37:06.406
<i>( door opens )</i>

37:07.725 --> 37:09.659
I'm sorry.

37:09.694 --> 37:11.945

- Yes, sir.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.446
You're willie's father?

37:13.497 --> 37:15.615
No, his uncle.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.250
Oh.

37:17.285 --> 37:19.286
How do you--

37:19.337 --> 37:20.620
I'll come back later.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.572
- <i>I was just--</i>
- it's all right.

37:22.590 --> 37:25.008
I have to get back home.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.178
Remember what
we talked about.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.645
It's good
to meet you, clayton.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.618
Where the hell
have you been all day?

37:51.652 --> 37:53.570
Didn't feel like
going to class.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.272
Christ, will,
everybody's talking
about--

37:56.290 --> 37:58.274
What are we gonna do?

37:58.292 --> 38:00.327
It's taken care of.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.046
What does that mean?

38:03.080 --> 38:05.382
It's been taken care of.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.634
He's dead, will.
That's not just
gonna go--

38:07.668 --> 38:09.586
Clayton, I have to study.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.254
What?

38:11.288 --> 38:14.057
There's a test
in commerce tomorrow

38:14.091 --> 38:15.508
And I have to study.

38:15.559 --> 38:18.762
So how about
you leave me alone?

A numerically
disadvantaged situation.

A what?

38:40.751 --> 38:42.585
There's six carloads
on the way.

<i>Have a nice dinner.</i>

Terrified.

I must repulse you.

No. I know
about weakness.

You don't know

any of this better.

45:19.099 --> 45:22.402
- Now it's arrived.
- From far across the seas.

45:22.436 --> 45:26.272
<i>Stellvertretender</i>
<i>direktor.</i>

45:26.323 --> 45:28.057
Selby:
<i>Assistant manager.</i>

45:28.075 --> 45:29.742
Was that a good job?

45:29.777 --> 45:32.061
It was a position
of respect.

45:32.079 --> 45:34.664
- Watch over the employees.
- Make sure nobody steals.

45:34.698 --> 45:37.066
There were many
responsibilities.

45:37.084 --> 45:39.368
And they all
depended on loyalty,
didn't they?

45:39.402 --> 45:41.587
Loyalty and honesty.

45:41.622 --> 45:44.340
- You pride yourself on that.
- I strive.

45:44.374 --> 45:47.627
You strive.
You strive.

45:47.678 --> 45:49.595
Did you even
tell your wife?

45:49.630 --> 45:52.098
- <i>Your sons?</i>
- Knox: <i>Or just leave</i>
<i>with the money?</i>

45:52.132 --> 45:54.300
Selby:
<i>The money and mistress.</i>

45:54.351 --> 45:56.719
Knox:
<i>She worked behind</i>
<i>the lingerie counter.</i>

45:56.753 --> 45:58.638
How long did that last?

45:59.690 --> 46:01.774
Not long.

46:01.809 --> 46:04.093
So much for happiness,
huh, ed?

46:06.613 --> 46:10.233
I am a legal resident
of the United States.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.201
You are what
I say you are.

46:12.236 --> 46:14.320
And I say
you don't belong here.

46:14.371 --> 46:16.622
Then deport me.

46:16.657 --> 46:20.960
( speaking german )

46:24.281 --> 46:26.582
( speaks german )

46:26.616 --> 46:28.835
I was army intelligence
during the war.

46:28.886 --> 46:31.254
I thought the language
was very beautiful.

46:34.892 --> 46:38.728
"a father rides with his son
through night and wind.

46:38.762 --> 46:41.314
<i>The child is terrified.</i>

46:41.348 --> 46:43.516
<i>A demon in the woods.</i>

46:43.567 --> 46:45.351
<i>The elfking."</i>

46:46.737 --> 46:48.771
What does
the father say, ed?

46:48.805 --> 46:53.142
( speaking german )

46:53.160 --> 46:55.828
- "only a wisp of fog."
- <i>ja.</i>

46:55.863 --> 46:58.164
<i>But the father is wrong</i>
<i>and the elfking is real</i>

46:58.198 --> 47:02.084
And the son--
what happens to the son,
ed, in beautiful german?

47:02.119 --> 47:04.453
( speaking german )

47:10.177 --> 47:12.512
"in his arms

47:12.546 --> 47:14.714
The child was dead."

47:15.599 --> 47:17.266
<i>Ja.</i>

47:21.638 --> 47:24.941
Your boys,
konrad and lucas,
they're grown men now.

47:24.975 --> 47:26.893
Lucas has a son
of his own.

47:26.944 --> 47:29.645
- What?
- They changed
their last name.

47:29.679 --> 47:31.781
As if you
didn't even exist.

47:31.815 --> 47:34.683
To escape the shame
their father the thief,

47:34.701 --> 47:38.187
<i>The liar,</i>
<i>the traitor</i>

47:38.205 --> 47:40.406
<i>Brought upon them.</i>

47:40.457 --> 47:43.826
Six days from now,
you'll be in the custody
of the hanover police.

47:43.860 --> 47:47.463
<i>Then you and your boys</i>
<i>can get acquainted</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

47:47.530 --> 47:50.249
Think how glad
they'll be to see you.

47:55.138 --> 47:57.706
What do you want
from me?

47:57.724 --> 47:59.642
We want you
to tell us something.

47:59.676 --> 48:02.645
What? What?

48:02.679 --> 48:04.764
I do not know.

48:06.316 --> 48:08.317
What do you
want me to say?

48:08.352 --> 48:11.153
- You decide.
- You decide and you can go.

48:13.106 --> 48:15.557
I do not understand.

48:19.329 --> 48:21.197
It's very simple, ed.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.950
You tell us one thing,
one little thing,

48:24.001 --> 48:26.369
And we're done for today.
You have my word.

48:26.403 --> 48:29.088
Call it a demonstration
of loyalty.

48:37.431 --> 48:39.632
( paper rustles )

48:45.472 --> 48:48.107
Ralph capone.

48:48.976 --> 48:50.526
Yes?

48:50.560 --> 48:53.262
At the train station.

48:54.481 --> 48:57.867
That was the man
I gave the money to.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.203
Why?

49:09.663 --> 49:12.281
( sobbing )
because...

49:12.299 --> 49:16.669
That is what Nucky
told me to do.

49:27.264 --> 49:29.231
See how easy that was?

49:48.368 --> 49:50.652
Ed...

49:52.089 --> 49:54.206
We'll see you
again soon.

50:33.797 --> 50:35.864
I get off a train...

50:37.834 --> 50:40.386
And right there

50:40.420 --> 50:42.371
In a newspaper...

50:53.049 --> 50:56.068
What was wrong
with brooklyn, huh?

50:56.103 --> 50:58.738
We was all happy there.

50:58.772 --> 51:02.274
Al says,
"come out," and...

51:11.418 --> 51:14.286
He wants to speak
to you personal.

51:20.743 --> 51:22.845
Go on.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.290
There's not much
more to go on.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.161
Word is they were
chicago detectives.

51:55.212 --> 51:57.663
A special squad.

51:57.714 --> 51:59.965
They say someone called
and told them

52:00.000 --> 52:04.470
The cicero police
couldn't be trusted.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.625
He never got
his gun out.

52:13.796 --> 52:15.397
( sniffles )

52:17.634 --> 52:21.970
Every fucking thing
that crawls

52:21.988 --> 52:23.906
Is gonna pay.

52:25.692 --> 52:27.827
<i>( al crying )</i>

52:46.496 --> 52:48.964
( kisses )

52:52.102 --> 52:54.937
( sobbing )

53:26.503 --> 53:29.138
Clayton davies?

53:29.172 --> 53:31.724
We're with
the philadelphia police.

53:34.060 --> 53:37.045
<i>( ukulele playing )</i>

53:52.779 --> 53:54.947
<i>( knocking )</i>

53:58.067 --> 54:00.235
<i>( knocking )</i>

54:07.677 --> 54:09.845
You're not supposed
to be up here.

54:09.879 --> 54:12.748
Then you better not
let anyone see me.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.192
Do you know
what happened?

54:24.594 --> 54:26.695
They arrested clayton.

54:26.730 --> 54:29.114
What do you mean?

54:29.149 --> 54:31.933
The police came
and they arrested him.

54:31.952 --> 54:34.320
They said
he poisoned henry.

54:38.241 --> 54:41.076
Why would somebody
do something like that?

54:51.254 --> 54:53.789
( crying )

55:03.466 --> 55:05.651
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

55:05.685 --> 55:08.821
<i>( boat horn blaring )</i>

55:46.359 --> 55:48.694
<i>The hell</i>
<i>happened to you?</i>

55:51.781 --> 55:53.699
What do you mean?

55:58.521 --> 56:00.372
You look like
you slept on a bench.

56:00.407 --> 56:03.208
I spent the night
with old friends.

56:03.243 --> 56:06.078
There was much drinking.
Too much.

56:06.129 --> 56:08.497
And the night
became morning.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.549
If you're going to disappear
for an entire day--

56:10.583 --> 56:12.200
It will not happen again.

56:12.218 --> 56:15.370
I shouldn't have
to worry about that.
You understand?

56:17.807 --> 56:19.425
That's all I'm saying.

56:19.476 --> 56:23.011
It's a responsibility
that you asked for.

56:29.569 --> 56:32.905
- Have you eaten?
- I am not hungry.

56:34.390 --> 56:36.075
Suit yourself.

56:41.414 --> 56:43.064
<i>Hold on.</i>

56:46.252 --> 56:48.236
Come over here.

57:09.025 --> 57:10.976
Well?

57:11.027 --> 57:14.613
<i>Here's something else</i>
<i>I'd rather not worry about.</i>

57:16.900 --> 57:19.868
<i>( music playing )</i>

58:25.835 --> 58:28.554

58:41.017 --> 58:43.886
