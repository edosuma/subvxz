Um, can you tell me
where ward k2 is, please?

01:11.160 --> 01:12.360
Oh.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.920
[Buzzing]

01:16.920 --> 01:18.520
You're late, Kim.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.800
- I'm sorry, I couldn't find the ward.
- [Sighs]

01:20.960 --> 01:23.216
Did you not get the briefing
about following the yellow line?

01:23.240 --> 01:25.160
Yeah, and I did
think about that,

01:25.320 --> 01:27.776
but then I thought it might just be a
patient that had pissed themselves.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.920
Can you get your coat off
and come and give us a hand?

01:30.080 --> 01:31.240
Okay.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.656
Kim: I don't know. It's a
very fancy bed, isn't it?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.360
Well, let's just have
a crack, shall we?

01:37.520 --> 01:38.896
- It can't be that difficult.
- [Sighs]

01:38.920 --> 01:41.120
Well, I haven't been to a
training session, Kim, so...

01:41.280 --> 01:43.320
All right, I'm quite
good on the ds.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.040
Den: Can we just move it up?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.096
-[Whirring] -That's it,
that's good. That's excellent.

01:47.120 --> 01:50.240
Yeah, Kim, can you just make sure it
doesn't actually... She actually doesn't...

01:50.400 --> 01:52.920
Kim! Kim! Please stop,
stop, stop! Stop that now.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.440
Can you not get it back down?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.400
Yeah. No, Kim, you're
gonna squash her now.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.720
- Well...
- Kim! Kim! Her knees are...

01:58.880 --> 02:01.080
Can you not just make the
whole thing come down flat now?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.640
- [Whirring]
- That's better. That's...

02:02.680 --> 02:03.960
You've got to hold her, though.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.976
You've got to make sure
she's not going to topple.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.176
- Kim! Kim!
- I can't, 'cause I'm pressing the button, aren't I?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.640
Den: Move it more towards me.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.760
Ah, that's perfect. Okay,
if I hold her, can you...

02:12.920 --> 02:15.840
-Oh, bloody hell!
-Oh, no. No, stop. Stop, stop, stop!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.736
-Have you got her?
-Stop. That's too much. Yeah. That's too...

02:17.760 --> 02:20.480
- I mean I'm holding her.
- Can I go for my break now?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.760
[Both laughing]

02:22.920 --> 02:24.920
- There.
- That's it. Now, I think we should just...

02:25.000 --> 02:27.296
- Leave her there.
- Leave her there, but press the emergency

02:27.320 --> 02:29.920
so we can get it right back
down to the normal height.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.000
There's a... There's a red
handle. Shall we give that a go?

02:33.160 --> 02:34.640
Yeah, give that a go.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.560
- Ooh.
- Oh, that's it, perfect.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.560
See, that's what you need,
a handle, not some button.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.160
Do her pulse oximeter
and reset the bed.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.240
But the thing is, like, right,
it's not responding now.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.520
I think what's happened, Kim, is you've
given it so many mixed messages...

02:49.680 --> 02:53.800
How can I give a
machine mixed messages?

02:53.960 --> 02:55.960
- [Water pouring] - Will
you drink a bit for me now?

02:56.920 --> 02:58.840
[Softly] All right.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.920
Yeah, let me put it here.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.720
Yeah.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.040
- [Sighing] - I think that is
sister's office, you know.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.400
Because you wouldn't build a ward
without a sister's office, would you?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.840
- But, perhaps, it's a linen cupboard.
- Mmm-hmm.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.120
Oh, Kim, you can't take
your break this morning

03:22.280 --> 03:25.040
'cause I've booked in
my health mot for 11:00.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.600
Aiden is a bit worried
about my heart.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.400
And, well, he likes me
cuddly for sex, obviously, but...

03:30.560 --> 03:32.360
- Please.
- It's just, you know,

03:32.520 --> 03:34.176
I'm trying to be a
responsible human being.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.840
Actually, if I miss my break,
then can I go 10 minutes early?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.720
It's Darren's birthday.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.320
I'll think about it, all right?

03:41.480 --> 03:43.880
What time are you booked
in, anyway, for yours?

03:44.040 --> 03:47.000
Oh, I'm not gonna bother. I mean, I
know exactly what he's going to say.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.880
"Low-fat diet, give up
smoking, bmi, give us a kiss."

03:52.040 --> 03:53.440
[Phone ringing]

03:55.360 --> 03:57.760
Hello. Ward k2.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, I think I've got one bed.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.760
Bay 2, k2. [Chuckling]

04:05.000 --> 04:06.360

[Mouthing]

04:13.880 --> 04:15.520
[Door opening]

04:15.680 --> 04:19.560
Gents, morning. Sorry, I had to
navigate my way around the m25.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.320
I had a mini-break to celebrate
my decree nisi. [Laughs]

04:22.480 --> 04:24.160
Den, can I just pop
these in your office?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.480
- Just a few...
- Oh, sorry, I don't have an office yet.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.040
Oh, snap! Oh, dear, there do
seem to be some teething problems

04:29.080 --> 04:30.800
- with this merger, don't there?
- Den: Yeah.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.336
Well, can I just pop them
behind your desk for now, then?

04:32.360 --> 04:34.520
- Den: Uh, well...
- Uh, no, no, sorry.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.280
My other pair of shoes and
my sandwiches are already...

04:37.440 --> 04:39.080
- Two pairs of shoes? Gosh.
- Yeah. Um...

04:39.240 --> 04:40.640
Hardly imelda Marcos, is it?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.296
There we go. Look, there's
plenty of room under there.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.040
I'll just pop them under here.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.136
Could you leave them in your
car, please, dr Moore? Would that...

04:46.160 --> 04:49.240
No, no, no, no. You should never
leave things in an unattended car.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.760
Rule number four. There we
go. Look, that's plenty of space.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.696
- That won't get in your way. All right?
- The thing is

04:54.720 --> 04:56.120
it does take up
quite a lot of room.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.856
Well, they can flatten it,
can't they? Because they...

04:57.880 --> 05:00.680
I mean that's actually a 600-thread
Egyptian cotton which, er...

05:00.840 --> 05:02.736
A bit of a bargain there,
gents, at the outlet village.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.280
I mean, I couldn't
get the whole set.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.880
Um, I had to make do
with percale pillowcases,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.080
but I think that's not really going
to show in the guest bedrooms.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.360
Yes, Philip always had to have,
uh, poly-mix 'cause of the psoriasis.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.160
But, uh, there
we go, that's all.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.680
Josh, can I have
a very quick word?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.320
Can't we just set fire to them?

05:20.480 --> 05:23.376
Josh, I know that your parents are very,
very disappointed that you're into retakes,

05:23.400 --> 05:28.480
and goodness knows, yes, it's been a
disappointment, but, um, looking forward,

05:28.640 --> 05:31.120
on the bright side, I do
have some exciting news.

05:31.280 --> 05:35.480
I have a new research program
which I'm going to need a helpmeet on.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.560
I've had a phone call from
professor portnoy-noor,

05:38.720 --> 05:40.920
who tells me that we're
absolutely ticking the right box,

05:40.960 --> 05:43.440
that the green light
is almost imminent.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.440
Um, what I'm going to do is
bring the genito-urinary team

05:46.600 --> 05:48.160
bang up against the bowel boys.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.120
It's going to be
pretty radical stuff,

05:50.280 --> 05:53.440
and you're going to be one of
the first to get in there, so think on.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.520
Uh, right. Gents, do
you want to come over?

05:56.680 --> 05:59.080
Oh, incidentally, gents, if you
do head over Woodstock way,

05:59.240 --> 06:03.280
do divert to the blenheim palace
tapestries. They are absolutely magical.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.600
Jolly good. Try and keep up,
please. Do try and look a little...

06:06.760 --> 06:08.560
- Oh, den, you've dropped your...
- Mouse.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.320
Mouse is on the floor. Eek!

06:10.480 --> 06:11.616
Um, so where are
we going this morning?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.080
Den: We're going
to mrs Ben-Abdullah.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.080
Hello there, mrs Ben.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.720
- Mrs Ben-Abdullah.
- That's right.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.160
- How are you?
- Hello.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.656
- Hello.
- Are you feeling much better?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.456
- Yeah, she's much better.
- She's much better, is she...

06:21.480 --> 06:23.816
- Responded very well to the co-amoxiclav, haven't you?
- Yeah.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.360
- Terrific.
- You were supposed to discharge her on Friday.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.080
It's just you
weren't here, so...

06:28.240 --> 06:29.680
Right. Can we get
the obs up, sister?

06:29.720 --> 06:31.240
- Yes, okay.
- Thank you.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.080
Not quite yet.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.816
Does anybody know how to
work these things? Do you know?

06:35.840 --> 06:38.016
-Yes, I do. Yeah.
-Oh, you do? You've had training, have you?

06:38.040 --> 06:39.600
Just a bit stuck at the moment.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.440
Is that you or is
that the machine?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.416
- Uh, I don't think it's me.
- Sorry, den, do you want to switch

06:43.440 --> 06:45.120
with this gentleman
here? Thank you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.640
Yes. Sorry. Hansley, would
you mind just doing bed two first?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.576
- I have a timetable.
- Yeah, I know, but don't worry,

06:49.600 --> 06:51.560
'cause I can have a word
with your superior nurse.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.736
I'd like somebody to listen to her
chest. Come on, somebody volunteer.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.360
You're not going
to bite, are you?

06:55.520 --> 06:58.056
No, she's not going to bite, she's
promised me. Can I have a volunteer?

06:58.080 --> 07:00.880
Good. Okay, yes. Josh, you
weren't quick enough. Come around.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.736
Jolly good, have a
little listen to the chest.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.560
Have we got the obs up yet, den?

07:04.720 --> 07:06.456
This is a huge step-change
in the right direction,

07:06.480 --> 07:09.000
with these electronic
patient records here.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.360
We are no longer bogged
down by these huge paper notes,

07:11.520 --> 07:13.720
as you will remember
from recently, Josh.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.640
- So, is that working?
- Well...

07:15.800 --> 07:17.720
Good morning! What
would you like for your lunch?

07:17.840 --> 07:21.720
- You are gluten-free, soft and halal.
- Halal, please.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.760
Halal. So, that's,
um, Thai green curry.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.800
That sounds
delicious, doesn't it?

07:26.960 --> 07:28.456
But this lady's actually not
going to be here for lunch today,

07:28.480 --> 07:31.360
because we're just
sorting out her tto, so...

07:31.520 --> 07:36.280
If sister could please, uh, send an e-mail
to eezi heat services, the luton offices.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.200
And they can forward that, then,
to pondicherry for processing.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.480
-Yes, I've done that already. I did that on Friday.
-E-e-z-i?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.680
- Co.uk or .com?
- Yeah, can we get this blood...

07:44.840 --> 07:47.240
Can we sort this out
later? Thank you so much.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.360
- And what is the problem here?
- Um...

07:49.520 --> 07:51.760
Is that coming out? Can you
give it a quick wipe, maybe?

07:51.920 --> 07:54.080
-[Tapping] No, I think actually...
-Hello? Hello!

07:54.240 --> 07:55.760
It might be
quicker if I just get

07:55.920 --> 07:57.096
-the paper records.
-Can we get a cloth? We need to...

07:57.120 --> 07:58.680
- Can you...
- No, sorry, sorry.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.896
- They're not allowed to clean those machines.
- Oh, for goodness sake.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.080
Do I have to do everything?
Sorry, just borrowing your...

08:04.240 --> 08:05.960
Sorry, dr Moore.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.416
- Sorry, you aren't allowed to actually...
- Yes, no, I'm doing it.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.600
- Yeah, but you can't put water on it.
- [Zapping]

08:10.760 --> 08:13.520
Um, that'll probably dry
off. Will it? I would imagine.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.480
I dropped my mobile once down
the toilet, and that was actually fine.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.360
Right. Gents. Er,
where to next, sister?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.280
- Hi.
- Hi, Kim.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.480
Welcome to st Jude's.
It's lovely to see you again.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.560
Thank you. Hello.
Hello, matrons.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.760
- No, it... it's mister.
- Hello, mister.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.000
Mr loftus is undertaking a private
consultative contract for the trust.

08:33.160 --> 08:37.040
He's carrying out a skills mix review
in a number of wards, including k2.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.680
You won't even know I'm here.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.360
And would either of you
like a cake? Mr loftus?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.040
It's all in a good
cause. Cultural diversity.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.440
- Go on. The yellow one matches your tie.
- Um...

08:47.600 --> 08:50.040
Do you mind if I
don't? This is Armani.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.160
- Den: Oh, hi, Damaris.
- Hi!

08:52.320 --> 08:56.640
- Hils. Wow! Hi.
- Hi, hi. Um...

08:56.800 --> 08:59.760
Um, could you get mr
loftus a chair, please, sister?

08:59.920 --> 09:03.400
- Kim, could you get mr loftus a chair, please?
- No, no need whatsoever.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.880
I'm just here to observe. Um...

09:06.040 --> 09:08.360
I'll just, um, blend
into the wallpaper.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.720
You're just standing
there watching us, then?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.600
Yeah, I hope you're not going
to watch my bottom! [Chuckles]

09:13.760 --> 09:17.240
Uh, cultural diversity
cupcake, den?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.280
Oh, that... oh, they're...
Oh, they're so pretty.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.400
It's just a little welcome to
the hospital for the two of you.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.296
- I love cultural diversity.
- Damaris: Yes...

09:25.320 --> 09:26.616
Yeah, I've been out
with loads of black guys,

09:26.640 --> 09:28.376
- you know, it was always brilliant.
- [Hilary clears throat]

09:28.400 --> 09:31.080
- Um, I'm just gonna set up my iPad.
- Damaris: Right.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.840
Do you mind if I
have the pink one?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.800
Damaris: I'll see you
later. Enjoy the cakes.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.816
- Den: Oh, thank you so much.
- Damaris: It's okay.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.440
- Den.
- Mmm.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.440
He is looking at
your bum, you know.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.080
Don't worry about
it, Kim, honestly.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.960
He's gay. I'm married.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.720
Want one?

10:09.120 --> 10:12.400
- Sorry.
- Oh, den, could I have a word with you in private, please?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.960
- Yes. Absolutely. Yes, um...
- Is that all right?

10:15.120 --> 10:19.720
- Jolly good.
- Just wondered if anybody else fancied the yellow cake?

10:19.880 --> 10:22.600
- You don't want it, do you, Kim?
- Uh, no, thank you.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.496
- All right.
- Do you want to come into my temporary office?

10:24.520 --> 10:25.520
Yes, absolutely.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.640
You're in here, are you?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.760
- Yes. Um, do take a seat.
- Gosh.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.680
No, I'm fine, thank you.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.840
I just need to get your buy-in,
den, for my research, uh,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.080
which is colonisation of conventional
gut bacteria in the amenorrheic woman

10:38.240 --> 10:42.000
and its effect on mucosa in
the atrophic vagina and urethra.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.280
- So, what I...
- Mmm. That's, um, what in layman...

10:44.440 --> 10:46.800
Well, put in layperson's
terms I suppose,

10:46.960 --> 10:48.976
well, you're probably already
aware yourself, aren't you,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.016
of certain changes in the
undercarriage area, and the...

10:51.040 --> 10:53.360
- Sorry, where is this headed?
- Not to worry.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.920
- Uh, very much in post-65 vulvas, um...
- Okay.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.320
Which, you know,
obviously, you've a way to go,

10:59.480 --> 11:01.336
but specifically what we're
going to be looking for,

11:01.360 --> 11:03.160
and this is where you're
going to come in, um,

11:03.280 --> 11:07.120
is polarisation of the vaginal
area, thinning of tissue...

11:07.280 --> 11:09.600
Sounds fascinating,
absolutely. It's just that, um,

11:09.760 --> 11:11.696
it's not that I don't want
to get involved, it's just that

11:11.720 --> 11:13.720
you're gonna have to take
it up with my successor.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.696
- Have... have you been...
- No, no, no, no.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.360
-No? Gosh.
-Aiden and I, we... Well, we're moving.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.440
- Where are you going?
- Uh, Leicester.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.880
Oh, dear.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.816
- What's he up to?
- He's starting a business with his brother.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.440
- Mmm.
- Car valeting.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.456
Oh, right. And you're going to be
helping with the scrubbing, are you?

11:30.480 --> 11:32.200
No, no, no. He doesn't
want me to, um...

11:32.360 --> 11:33.800
Doesn't want me to
work anymore so...

11:33.880 --> 11:35.696
Are you sure you want to give
up your independence, den?

11:35.720 --> 11:37.560
- Certain, yeah.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.600
I think you'd have enjoyed getting
your teeth into my vaginal atrophy.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.040
Possibly, yes.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.880
Oh, whilst we're here, den,

11:44.040 --> 11:46.520
could you check how many times
mrs Ben-Abdullah is doing a wee?

11:46.680 --> 11:48.440
Because that's going
to affect her discharge.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.600
- Yes.
- All right, thank you.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.080
- [Buzzing]
- [Door opening]

11:54.680 --> 11:58.480
- Oh, hello again, mrs dethick.
- Hello there.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.440
- I'm not well.
- No? Not too good?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.680
No, no, not good at all.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.040
-Come on, then. Shall we put you into bed?
-Okay.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
- Are you all right, Donald?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.480
[Snoring]

12:22.840 --> 12:23.880
Mmm.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.320
Mmm. Did you get
any pillowcases, Kim?

12:31.480 --> 12:34.040
Uh, no, annapurna
said they're a bit low, too,

12:34.200 --> 12:36.520
but they'd talk to fuji
later and maybe get some.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.840
- Hello, has mrs dethick arrived yet?
- She has, yes.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.880
- Not that she's really ill, so it doesn't make much...
- Sorry? Sorry?

12:44.040 --> 12:46.320
Um... yeah, I was just, uh...

12:46.480 --> 12:47.920
She's not actually
that ill, so...

12:48.080 --> 12:51.240
- Oh. Have you already examined her, dr Dukes?
- No.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.320
No. Right, well, we'll... We'll see, then,
shall we? Have her notes come up yet?

12:55.480 --> 12:57.336
I've got the older ones,
some of the paper ones,

12:57.360 --> 13:00.760
because the epr's gone down now
and we're waiting for maintenance.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.856
There's no blame intended there 'cause
accidents do happen, of course, so...

13:03.880 --> 13:06.600
- Have you had your health check, James?
- Er, no. 11:30.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.720
Yes, dr kersley's told me that
I've got rather low cholesterol.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.016
I can even indulge in a
little bit more butter. [Laughs]

13:12.040 --> 13:14.321
Although he probably won't
say that to you, will he, James?

13:14.400 --> 13:17.720
[Stuttering] It's
genetics often, isn't it?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.320
- But, uh, no...
- Does he do bloods?

13:19.440 --> 13:21.400
Yes, bloods,
swabs, urine. The lot.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.600
- Brilliant. Oh, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
- He's pretty thorough. Mmm.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.320
- Hello, mrs dethick.
- Hello.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.360
You remember dr Moore. I'm sure
you'll remember mrs dethick, won't you?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.280
- Yes, hello again. Hello.
- Hello.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.400
Yes, she was in in
march, um, for biliary colic,

13:37.560 --> 13:40.360
and she had some
tests, June, abdo x-rays.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.520
- That was severe constipation.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.696
September, you had intravenous urethrogram,
didn't you, for renal colic and stones?

13:45.720 --> 13:46.760
Yeah.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.360
All those test
results were negative.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.696
And now you've spotted
blood in your faeces?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.600
- I saw a poster in the chemist.
- Mmm.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.200
Yes, I think sometimes those can
be a bit alarming, can't they, yes?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.656
Sometimes a bit
of autosuggestion...

13:56.680 --> 13:58.520
Yes, so that must have
caused you some alarm?

13:58.680 --> 14:00.720
Yes, and I haven't been
feeling very well in myself.

14:00.880 --> 14:05.200
No. I think we'll run a few routine tests,
you know, rule out anything sinister.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.520
All right? So, Josh, do you want
to, um, organise using this group,

14:08.680 --> 14:11.640
and, say, top and tail
colonoscopy, please, as well.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.720
And bloods, check the
haematinics. Thank you.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.160
- And will I have to have an mri scan?
- Not necessarily, no.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.120
Because the thing is
I get claustrophobic.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.016
- She's already had a cat scan.
- And was that clear?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.320
- Yes.
- Well, I mean, obviously, these things can change,

14:24.480 --> 14:26.720
and sometimes pretty
quickly, unfortunately.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.440
[Whispering] The last time she
was in, it was just constipation.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.360
There was nothing more serious.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.376
Yes, that may well be the case,
den, but we don't want to rule out

14:34.400 --> 14:37.360
metastasisation of the liver and
pancreas and possibly even, you know,

14:37.520 --> 14:38.680
ovarian cancer so...

14:38.840 --> 14:40.640
Oh, actually, Josh,

14:40.800 --> 14:43.720
could you pop down a ca-125 tumour
marker on that list for me, please?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.200
- And how's your appetite?
- It's very poor.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.840
- Is it?
- [Softly] Yes, well, she did manage the cupcakes so...

14:48.960 --> 14:52.000
- Mrs dethick: Yes, but I didn't have any breakfast.
- Pippa: Mmm.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.240
All right, well, I think
we'll run the routine tests,

14:54.280 --> 14:56.096
and, just to be on the safe side,
perhaps we'll ask the oncology team

14:56.120 --> 14:57.376
to pop down and
have a little look,

14:57.400 --> 15:00.480
just to get the differential
diagnoses, all right?

15:00.640 --> 15:03.920
In the meantime, could you
organise, 20 milligrams of buscopan

15:04.080 --> 15:07.440
and some paracetamol,
all right? Um, thank you.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.680
You just have a quick
relax there, mrs dethick, yes?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.760
[Whispering] That woman is
completely wasting our time.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.656
There's people in here who are actually
ill, I mean, people like enid here.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.960
- All right, enid?
- I didn't get much sleep last night.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.480
- No.
- It was so hot.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.160
Den, look, that's the last
of the sheets, all right?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.920
- Can I put a duvet cover on her?
- Yeah.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.040
Just use your discretion, Kim. I
mean, does it actually need changing?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.160
Well, it did, yeah.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.560
Ah. Er, Josh, can
I firm you up later?

15:39.720 --> 15:43.320
Um, look, I know in
your continent, um...

15:43.480 --> 15:47.920
I just think that vulvas could be a very
exciting area for you to get into as, er,

15:48.080 --> 15:51.440
your specialism, you know, given
some of the more, er, barbaric,

15:51.600 --> 15:54.000
for want of a better
expression, er, practices...

15:54.160 --> 15:57.840
I mean, although, obviously, who are
we in the west to judge these things?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.720
Um, but I really feel, Josh,

16:00.880 --> 16:03.160
if you come on board
with my vag-at, you know,

16:03.320 --> 16:05.376
by the time you do get
back to your part of the world,

16:05.400 --> 16:09.080
you will know the intricacies of female
genitalia like the back of your hand.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.280
So, you know, think on.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.456
Ah, sorry, I didn't realise
you were here, mr loftus.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.080
This is highly confidential
pioneering clinical research, so, um...

16:19.480 --> 16:22.240
You're not here anyway, are you?

16:22.400 --> 16:25.720
-Right. Okay. Er, yes, thank you.
-[Door closing]

16:27.880 --> 16:31.800
Sorry, mrs Ben-Abdullah. You're still
waiting for your gp letter, aren't you?

16:31.960 --> 16:34.520
- That's right.
- Did you order some lunch?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.520
Uh, I'm not sure.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.520
- I'll make you some toast.
- Sorry, Kim, that took ages.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.400
It was fantastic,
absolutely amazing.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.640
I'm going to get all
the test results today.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.480
Do you want any
help with the red trays?

16:45.640 --> 16:49.600
Please. I've done ms
burgess. You want to do enid?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.280
Yeah, sure.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.360
Portobello and Chestnut
mushroom pappardelle?

16:54.520 --> 16:55.960
That's... They don't want that.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.400
They want mince and
potatoes. It's so stupid.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.760
Hey, mrs dethick. Can
I tempt you with that?

17:02.920 --> 17:04.880
I don't think so, dear.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.760
I heard the doctor say
something about cancer.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.800
Look, do you think that would
be right with my symptoms?

17:11.960 --> 17:14.040
I don't want to be a nuisance.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.720
No, listen, don't
worry about it.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.040
I mean, obviously, they've
got to rule out the worst.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.280
- Yeah.
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.760
- You think that's what it is?
- Absolutely.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.400
- Well, I hope you're right.
- Sorry, Kim.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.600
Sorry. Just have a quick word.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.616
[Whispering] Try not to
over-reassure the patients,

17:29.640 --> 17:33.160
because it's not good practice.
Just give them the facts, okay?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.776
[Whispering] Yeah, but you said
yourself there was nothing wrong with her.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.320
[Scoffs] There is nothing wrong with her
but we can't be the ones to tell her that.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.480
Oh.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.000
[Mobile phone ringing]

17:58.120 --> 18:03.000
Hi, Jason. No, we have got
tomato sauce. It's in the fridge.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.840
No, it's for Darren's
birthday cake.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.920
Well, look again!

18:07.080 --> 18:10.160
All right, well, we must have run
out. I'll get some on the way home.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.040
[Phone beeps]

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
-I like a treacle pudding. Do you?
-Yes, I do.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.040
That's it, good girl. Lovely.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.920
Hi, den. You having lunch?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.680
No, this is enid's lunch here.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.960
No, no, I mean later.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.480
Yeah, yeah.

18:30.640 --> 18:35.000
I thought perhaps we could
find a quiet corner in chatters.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.240
I don't... I don't think
it's a good idea, hilary.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.640
I have renewed my vows now.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.520
- I didn't know that.
- Mmm, yeah.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.240
Well, if I could just have a moment
with you, would that be all right?

18:48.400 --> 18:51.440
It's quite important.
If... if possible.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.920
Please?

18:56.240 --> 18:57.800
Enid, can you...

18:57.960 --> 19:00.880
- Do you want to help yourself to that? Yeah?
- All right, then.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.240
- Let's go to my office.
- Okay. Thank you, madam.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.280
[Exhales] Um, do you
want to take a seat?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.160
Okay.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.680
Now, what can I do for you?

19:20.840 --> 19:22.280
[Venitlator pumping]

19:22.440 --> 19:23.736
[Whispering] You
sure she can't hear?

19:23.760 --> 19:25.600
- No, no, she's stage 13.
- [Exhales]

19:25.760 --> 19:27.920
Unlucky for some. That's
what they say, isn't it?

19:28.080 --> 19:30.800
Well, not for me, though, 'cause
I can use this room as an office.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.520
Oh, right. Erm...

19:33.680 --> 19:36.160
Listen, what I've come
here for is to tell you

19:36.320 --> 19:38.680
I'm going to have one of those
health checks this afternoon.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.800
Right. You're not allowed one, are
you, 'cause you're not nhs anymore?

19:41.960 --> 19:43.520
'Cause you're an
accountant or...

19:43.680 --> 19:46.640
