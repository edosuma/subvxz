00:51.465 --> 00:54.571
Right now I'd like
you to meet a young lady,

00:54.606 --> 00:56.228
a very lovely young lady,

00:56.263 --> 00:58.575
that I really think has
what it takes to be around

00:58.610 --> 01:01.233
for a long, long time to come.

01:39.237 --> 01:40.859
Here's a gal
who really sings great.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.758
We had her on the show last
year and she was sensational.

01:44.621 --> 01:46.796
My first guest
occupies a prominent place

01:46.830 --> 01:48.453
in the Top 40 record charts

01:48.487 --> 01:50.179
and she
has a big one right now.

01:50.213 --> 01:52.491
Linda Ronstadt is
one of the really great talents

01:52.526 --> 01:53.458
in country music.

01:53.492 --> 01:55.667
Would you welcome
please Linda Ronstadt.

01:55.701 --> 01:57.427
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Linda Ronstadt.

02:06.229 --> 02:09.681
Linda could literally
sing anything.

02:11.234 --> 02:13.892
I don't think anybody has
tried more different styles

02:13.926 --> 02:15.894
and nailed it than Linda has.

02:16.688 --> 02:19.898
There's not that many people
that can pull off new wave music

02:19.932 --> 02:22.590
and rock and the most
beautiful country ballads.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.627
Her range is huge.

02:25.731 --> 02:28.355
She decided
what she wanted to do.

02:29.977 --> 02:33.498
More important what she
was authentic at doing.

02:33.705 --> 02:35.810
And they always told her no,
you can't do this,

02:35.845 --> 02:36.949
you'll ruin your career.

02:36.984 --> 02:38.468
She did it anyway.

02:59.317 --> 03:01.698
Someone
once asked why people sing.

03:03.873 --> 03:06.255
I answered that they sing
for any of the same reasons

03:06.289 --> 03:07.601
birds sing.

03:09.292 --> 03:10.742
They sing for a mate.

03:12.364 --> 03:13.917
To claim their territory.

03:15.643 --> 03:17.783
Or simply to give voice
to the delight of being alive

03:17.818 --> 03:19.854
in the midst of a beautiful day.

03:22.305 --> 03:24.894
They sing so the subsequent
generations won't forget what

03:24.928 --> 03:28.932
the current generations endured
or dreamed or delighted in.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.422
There are a lot of really
good singers out in the world.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.010
A lot of better singers
than I am.

03:40.496 --> 03:42.946
What I did that was different
from other singers,

03:42.981 --> 03:45.466
I did a whole lot of
different kinds of material.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.367
People would think that I was
trying to reinvent myself

03:49.401 --> 03:51.023
but I never invented
myself to start with.

03:51.058 --> 03:53.509
I just kind of popped out
into the world.

04:00.688 --> 04:02.449
My mom grew up in Michigan.

04:04.071 --> 04:05.866
Her dad was an inventor.

04:07.005 --> 04:09.007
He was the third to
Thomas Edison in the number

04:09.041 --> 04:11.630
of useful inventions in the 50s.

04:11.665 --> 04:16.014
He invented the electric stove,
the electric toaster.

04:18.672 --> 04:20.743
The thermostat for Westinghouse.

04:24.022 --> 04:26.024
But my grandmother
had Parkinson's disease

04:26.058 --> 04:28.889
and he spent all his money
trying to find a cure.

04:30.339 --> 04:31.961
And that's what I have now.

04:35.136 --> 04:37.069
My mom was really smart too.

04:37.415 --> 04:39.313
She wanted to study math
and physics

04:39.348 --> 04:42.040
and the University of Arizona
was really good for that.

04:42.074 --> 04:45.043
She came out to Tucson
where she met my father.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.391
My great grandfather
Frederick Ronstadt

04:48.426 --> 04:51.083
came from Germany
to Mexico in 1839.

04:51.636 --> 04:55.605
My father's father, Frederico,
moved to Tucson when he was 14

04:55.640 --> 04:57.400
to work as a wagon maker.

04:57.780 --> 04:59.747
But his true passion was music.

05:04.442 --> 05:07.893
So he started the Club
Filharmonico Tucsonense.

05:08.963 --> 05:11.380
He was the one who
wrote the arrangements

05:11.414 --> 05:13.692
and taught everybody
how to play their instruments.

05:13.934 --> 05:15.625
He was like the Music Man.

05:16.074 --> 05:17.627
If you wanted to serenade
your sweetheart,

05:17.662 --> 05:20.043
you'd get my grandfather's
band to go.

05:20.423 --> 05:22.563
And if you had a wedding
or a funeral,

05:22.598 --> 05:23.978
well, they'd show up for that.

05:27.188 --> 05:30.675
First time my mother ever saw
my dad he was riding his horse

05:30.709 --> 05:32.918
up the steps of her
sorority house.

05:35.196 --> 05:38.027
My dad had a lovely
baritone tenor voice

05:38.061 --> 05:40.063
and knew a lot of beautiful
Mexican love songs

05:40.098 --> 05:42.134
that were rooted
in his childhood.

05:44.861 --> 05:47.588
He serenaded my mother
underneath her balcony.

05:51.558 --> 05:53.663
And she fell big for him.

06:21.795 --> 06:23.555
I grew up in Tucson

06:23.590 --> 06:26.558
on the last ten acres of my
grandfather's cattle ranch.

06:26.972 --> 06:30.459
We were very isolated
so if you wanted entertainment

06:30.493 --> 06:32.461
you kind of had
to make your own.

06:34.739 --> 06:37.397
There was a lot of music
going on in that house.

06:37.983 --> 06:39.675
Some of it came in
through the radio.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.056
That was my best
friend in the world.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.716
We had an amazing radio
in Tucson

06:46.751 --> 06:48.891
because it was really close
to the border.

06:55.069 --> 06:56.761
We could get the
Louisiana Hayride.

07:04.734 --> 07:05.977
American standards.

07:10.119 --> 07:11.638
But my grandmother
and grandfather

07:11.672 --> 07:13.674
were classical music devotees.

07:18.990 --> 07:21.233
So I would go over to their
house on Saturday morning

07:21.268 --> 07:25.134
and listen to a live broadcast
from the Metropolitan Opera

07:25.824 --> 07:27.895
and come home and my dad
would be playing Mexican songs

07:27.930 --> 07:29.863
on the piano.
My mom would be playing

07:29.897 --> 07:31.865
some Gilbert and Sullivan piece.

07:35.075 --> 07:36.663
My sister loved Hank Williams.

07:36.697 --> 07:38.596
She loved country music.

07:44.912 --> 07:47.536
My brother would be
singing really high soprano.

07:49.261 --> 07:53.507
He was in a world-class boys
choir and he was their soloist.

07:53.852 --> 07:56.717
She wanted to know how
to sing so I taught here.

07:56.752 --> 07:58.650
So she learned about vibrato
and all that kind of stuff

07:58.685 --> 08:00.721
when she was like five,
six years old.

08:03.344 --> 08:06.037
We learned so much about singing
from each other.

08:06.796 --> 08:09.834
It was completely
incorporated into what we did.

08:09.868 --> 08:12.630
We sang at the dinner table,
we sang in the car,

08:12.664 --> 08:14.804
we sang with our hands
in the dishwater.

08:15.633 --> 08:19.119
I thought Spanish was this
magical musical language.

08:21.155 --> 08:23.572
When I was growing up
I thought people sang in Spanish

08:23.606 --> 08:25.056
and spoke in English.

08:25.988 --> 08:28.266
If you spoke Spanish on the
playground you'd be punished.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.130
You weren't allowed to do it.

08:33.927 --> 08:35.549
My sister and brother and I
eventually formed

08:35.583 --> 08:36.861
a little group.
We called ourselves

08:36.895 --> 08:38.966
The New Union Ramblers.

08:39.001 --> 08:41.106
We thought that sounded folky.

08:42.107 --> 08:45.904
Bobby Kimmel was a guitar
player that I met in Tucson.

08:45.939 --> 08:48.148
He wrote songs
about his own life.

08:48.804 --> 08:51.254
I remember them being
one of the best vocal groups

08:51.289 --> 08:52.842
I had ever heard.

08:56.121 --> 08:58.227
Bobby joined our family group

08:58.261 --> 09:01.575
and then he and I used to play
as a duet sometimes.

09:03.922 --> 09:06.200
We played little clubs in Tucson
but there wasn't very much

09:06.235 --> 09:08.202
opportunity for us there.

09:10.791 --> 09:14.312
At some point reality stepped
in and my sister had three kids.

09:15.658 --> 09:18.247
And then my brother went to
work for the police department.

09:20.939 --> 09:23.321
Bobby wanted to earn
some money playing music.

09:24.322 --> 09:26.358
So he went off to California.

09:27.843 --> 09:29.845
And I was the last man standing.

09:35.678 --> 09:39.164
I went to LA with the
intention of forming a band.

09:40.752 --> 09:44.894
When I saw the quality of the
singers that were out there

09:44.929 --> 09:47.379
I started writing
to Linda saying

09:47.414 --> 09:52.384
if you come out we could form
a band and get a record deal.

09:54.214 --> 09:56.388
I knew they had more
clubs to play in Los Angeles.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.947
I was telling her
this is kind of an iffy thing.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.742
You might starve to death
or you might find yourself

10:04.776 --> 10:07.020
washing dishes
and waiting tables

10:07.054 --> 10:08.815
before you ever get discovered.

10:08.849 --> 10:10.955
She says I'm willing
to take the chance.

10:12.473 --> 10:14.337
I was 18 years old.

10:15.718 --> 10:18.100
We had a house on the beach
for 80 bucks a month

10:18.134 --> 10:19.411
in Santa Monica.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.759
We split the rent three ways.

10:21.793 --> 10:24.900
It was just great.
It was right on the beach.

10:28.282 --> 10:31.320
Once she got there
we got to work right away

10:31.354 --> 10:33.667
and we used to practice
every day.

10:37.395 --> 10:39.431
Bobby introduced me
to a really good guitar player

10:39.466 --> 10:41.951
named Kenny Edwards
and we formed a little band

10:41.986 --> 10:44.057
and we called ourselves
The Stone Ponies.

10:49.925 --> 10:51.823
We started playing
little beatnik dives

10:51.858 --> 10:54.688
and strange pizza parlors,
wherever we could get a job.

10:56.863 --> 11:00.245
There was the trip where I heard
this band called The Byrds.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.937
They had a light show

11:01.971 --> 11:04.733
and a lot of acid tripping
kind of stuff going on.

11:06.389 --> 11:08.288
The Whiskey A Go Go
was very rock and roll.

11:08.322 --> 11:10.048
I heard the Doors there
and I thought

11:10.083 --> 11:12.982
oh they're be a really hit band
if they get rid of their singer.

11:17.193 --> 11:18.885
There was the Ash Grove.

11:18.919 --> 11:21.439
That was where you go
for authentic folk music.

11:21.888 --> 11:23.406
It's where I first
heard Ry Cooder.

11:31.207 --> 11:33.451
Ry Cooder was then and now
the most amazing guitar player

11:33.485 --> 11:35.073
I've ever heard.

11:35.108 --> 11:37.006
I knew that had good musicians
in Los Angeles

11:37.041 --> 11:38.767
but this guy
is really something.

11:38.801 --> 11:40.078
I thought I'm staying here.

11:40.113 --> 11:41.977
I'm not going back
to Tucson to live.

11:49.847 --> 11:52.781
She came
to Los Angeles at a time

11:52.815 --> 11:56.094
when the LA rock and roll scene
was in gear and was going.

11:56.129 --> 11:58.821
Because, see, after
The Byrds did their thing

11:58.856 --> 12:00.202
with Mr. Tambourine Man,

12:00.236 --> 12:02.307
then the whole damn thing
broke loose

12:02.342 --> 12:04.827
and all the record companies
when scurrying around

12:04.862 --> 12:08.831
like headless chickens trying
to figure out what to do.

12:08.866 --> 12:10.764
Who can sing folk rock

12:10.799 --> 12:14.803
and how can we define what
this thing is going to be?

12:21.810 --> 12:23.225
There was a lot
of cross pollination

12:23.259 --> 12:25.848
that started happening
in the mid-60s, you know,

12:25.883 --> 12:28.920
country music and folk music
and rock music started

12:28.955 --> 12:32.890
commingling and blending and you
would get all these hybrids.

12:35.030 --> 12:38.205
The Troubadour, just a few
blocks from Hollywood Boulevard,

12:38.240 --> 12:40.967
is known as an avant garde cafe.

12:41.001 --> 12:44.280
It's the favorite of Hollywood's
young and young at heart.

12:45.212 --> 12:47.283
The Troubadour was where
everybody went to hang out

12:47.318 --> 12:48.560
and to be noticed.

12:48.595 --> 12:50.908
You wanted to make yourself
known to the record community at

12:50.942 --> 12:54.359
large, you go to the Troubadour,
play an open mic night.

12:55.326 --> 12:57.190
I can't even name
all the great songwriters

12:57.224 --> 12:58.467
that came through there.

12:58.501 --> 13:01.228
I mean, Laura Nyro, Neil Young,

13:01.263 --> 13:03.230
Joni Mitchell, Tim Hardin,

13:03.265 --> 13:06.820
Kris Kristofferson, Rick Nelson,
Elton John,

13:06.855 --> 13:08.270
Jackson Browne.

13:08.304 --> 13:10.444
It was just week after week
of amazing,

13:10.479 --> 13:12.446
game-changing songwriters.

13:26.529 --> 13:28.877
I mean, you tried to get a gig
at the Troubadour.

13:28.911 --> 13:30.879
You wanted to play
the Troubadour.

13:30.913 --> 13:33.882
All kinds of industry
people hung around in the bar.

13:34.192 --> 13:35.884
The Troubadour
is important because

13:35.918 --> 13:37.368
that's where you can get seen.

13:37.402 --> 13:39.025
It was the place to play.

13:39.059 --> 13:40.543
Like the minor leagues
in baseball.

13:40.578 --> 13:43.374
This was your chance,
this was your great chance.

13:44.444 --> 13:46.895
The Troubadour
was a bustling place.

13:46.929 --> 13:50.208
They had a hootenanny night
where new artists would come

13:50.243 --> 13:53.142
and sing a few songs and I used
to go to every hootenanny night

13:53.177 --> 13:55.213
to see if there was anybody
really talented.

13:55.420 --> 13:58.009
The Hoot, the Monday
night open mic Hootenanny

13:58.044 --> 13:59.977
where you'd wait
and get on the list

14:00.011 --> 14:01.633
and you go up there
and sing your new song.

14:17.684 --> 14:18.927
You got two or three songs.

14:18.961 --> 14:21.930
If you were no good you probably
didn't last the second song

14:21.964 --> 14:24.933
because were, "Hey, get off!"

14:24.967 --> 14:27.107
And maybe not
even the first song.

14:34.943 --> 14:36.392
I heard a song
called Different Drum

14:36.427 --> 14:38.705
by this bluegrass group
called The Greenbriar Boys.

14:41.018 --> 14:42.536
It was written by Mike Nesmith

14:42.571 --> 14:44.607
who was eventually going
to join the Monkees.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.707
We got an immediate
response from managers

15:15.742 --> 15:18.400
and people who were interested
in our career.

15:19.194 --> 15:22.335
Herb Cohen
was managing Frank Zappa.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.407
We had head that he had
been a soldier of fortune.

15:25.441 --> 15:27.443
He was have killed somebody.

15:27.478 --> 15:29.204
He was a badass.

15:29.238 --> 15:32.552
But he was established
and he immediately said,

15:32.586 --> 15:34.588
"I can get you a record deal."

15:40.042 --> 15:43.563
We recorded a few things,
just the tree of us.

15:43.597 --> 15:47.118
Then he took those
to the people in power

15:47.153 --> 15:49.949
and said, "I want to
record these guys."

15:51.502 --> 15:53.124
Capitol said okay.

15:53.159 --> 15:55.782
We signed papers and we
were off and running.

16:01.305 --> 16:02.720
So we recorded it
with a mandolin

16:02.754 --> 16:05.205
and a couple
of acoustic guitars

16:05.240 --> 16:07.138
and the record company
didn't like it.

16:07.173 --> 16:10.210
And so they said well come back,
we want to recut the song.

16:10.624 --> 16:14.111
Certainly everything
changed in the studio.

16:14.387 --> 16:16.009
They had a bunch
of strings in there

16:16.044 --> 16:18.115
and it was an orchestra
session. I went wait a minute,

16:18.149 --> 16:19.633
this isn't the way
I thought about the song.

16:22.878 --> 16:24.604
I said I don't want to put it
on the record because

16:24.638 --> 16:26.813
that wasn't the way
I'd originally envisioned it.

16:39.722 --> 16:41.276
It was a good thing
they didn't listen to me

16:41.310 --> 16:43.312
because it was a huge hit.

16:43.347 --> 16:45.521
PETE
I'm driving down the road,
you know, in my car

16:45.556 --> 16:48.352
listening to KTKT radio
and all of a sudden

16:48.386 --> 16:50.388
she's singing Different Drum.

16:50.423 --> 16:52.218
I said wait a minute!

16:54.082 --> 16:56.118
I loved her voice from
the first time I heard her.

16:56.153 --> 16:57.809
I was a freshman in college.

16:57.844 --> 16:59.777
The Stone Poneys,
Different Drum.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.227
Yeah, baby!

17:01.261 --> 17:03.125
It was just like wow!

17:03.160 --> 17:07.336
It was just like to pull back
the covering

17:07.371 --> 17:10.684
of a fully developed
vocal stylist.

17:21.419 --> 17:25.527
Most of the time as a critic
you're sitting there saying,

17:25.560 --> 17:28.564
"We don't give the artist a plus
for this and a minus for this.

17:28.599 --> 17:31.119
This is kind of good,
that's not so good."

17:31.153 --> 17:33.397
Bang!
It was like a home run.

17:36.745 --> 17:39.299
We were out on this tour

17:39.334 --> 17:43.579
and Herby Cohen comes
to my hotel room and says,

17:43.614 --> 17:47.445
"I need to tell you that
when we get back to LA,

17:47.480 --> 17:49.447
the band is breaking up."

17:49.482 --> 17:52.381
Everybody said, "I don't know
about you two guys

17:52.416 --> 17:54.521
but we want the girl singer."

17:55.867 --> 17:59.147
The record company wanted to
develop me as a solo artist.

17:59.699 --> 18:03.358
Kenny decided to go off to India
and find a guru and meditate.

18:03.392 --> 18:06.809
And Bobby started a folk
club in LA called McCabe's.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.812
And I was left with
what in the world to sing.

18:09.847 --> 18:11.297
I was by myself.

18:11.331 --> 18:13.644
A harmony singer
with no material.

18:14.196 --> 18:16.923
The remarkable thing about
the Stone Poney days was

18:16.957 --> 18:19.857
she had the nerve
to leave a male band

18:19.891 --> 18:22.825
after it had already had a hit
and go on her own.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.862
Will you welcome please
Ms. Linda Ronstadt?

18:26.829 --> 18:29.418
Ronstadt, Ronstadt.

18:29.453 --> 18:32.283
Did anyone ever suggest that
that isn't the most musical name

18:32.318 --> 18:33.457
in the world.

18:33.491 --> 18:36.908
That maybe you should
change it to Linda Marlow or...

18:36.943 --> 18:37.944
Is there a Linda Marlow?

18:37.978 --> 18:41.361
And once they learn how
to pronounce my name,

18:41.396 --> 18:43.674
that leads to free-for-all
kinds of variations.

18:43.708 --> 18:46.435
Glenn Campbell once
called me Linda Bedstead.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.472
You know, I remember you
when you were nothing

18:48.506 --> 18:50.232
but a little Stone Poney.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.475
Oh yeah?

18:51.509 --> 18:52.959
I didn't have any idea
what that means.

18:52.993 --> 18:56.342
I know that you were
part of a group, right?

18:56.376 --> 18:58.171
Let's see, how do I explain this
on television

18:58.206 --> 18:59.448
and not get yelled at.

18:59.483 --> 19:00.898
Oh, then maybe you don't.

19:02.279 --> 19:03.866
- I think I don't.
- Oh, yeah?

19:03.901 --> 19:05.730
Oh, is it an inside meaning?

19:05.765 --> 19:08.526
Yeah, it has a
lot of different...

20:32.541 --> 20:34.060
I met her in the Troubadour.

20:34.094 --> 20:36.925
She had this hit
called Long, Long Time.

20:39.514 --> 20:41.032
Apparently she knew
who I was

20:41.067 --> 20:43.897
based on a record I'd made
with Ricky Nelson.

20:46.935 --> 20:50.628
She said I like that band you
put together for Rick Nelson.

20:50.663 --> 20:52.389
Could you do that for me?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.951
Herby Cohen was the
manager when I met her.

21:02.985 --> 21:04.918
He gave me these tickets
to Hawaii

21:04.953 --> 21:07.369
for the Capitol Records
convention.

21:07.404 --> 21:09.751
Linda and I show up
at San Francisco Airport

21:09.785 --> 21:13.755
to fly to Honolulu and lo
and behold there was the FBI

21:13.789 --> 21:16.827
to arrest us for receiving
stolen property.

21:16.861 --> 21:19.830
Turns out Herby had bought
the tickets in the lobby

21:19.864 --> 21:21.935
of the building from some guy

21:21.970 --> 21:24.835
probably for 25 cents
on the dollar

21:24.869 --> 21:26.906
and they were hotter
than a two-dollar pistol.

21:26.940 --> 21:30.427
So we spent the day in jail.

21:32.808 --> 21:35.777
She fired Herbie
and asked me to fill in.

21:40.126 --> 21:41.921
I was walking through
the Troubadour one night

21:41.955 --> 21:43.785
on my way to the bathroom.

21:45.373 --> 21:48.376
This band Shiloh got up
and did my exact version

21:48.410 --> 21:50.136
of Silver Threads
and Golden Needles.

21:53.691 --> 21:54.865
I just went, "What?"

21:54.899 --> 21:56.970
Does, you know, that solo,
I thought, God!

21:57.005 --> 21:59.007
I was appalled that anyone
would actually sit down

21:59.041 --> 22:02.942
with one of my records
and learn the solo off it

22:02.976 --> 22:05.185
like a Led Zeppelin record.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.843
And I heard the drummer and I
thought he was really good.

22:07.878 --> 22:10.398
The drummer was
a guy named Don Henley.

22:10.777 --> 22:14.056
Linda's first solo album
came out in '69

22:14.091 --> 22:17.577
and I moved to LA
in June of 1970.

22:18.095 --> 22:20.718
So my timing was pretty good.

22:20.994 --> 22:23.065
She'd had a bunch
of dates back East

22:23.100 --> 22:25.413
and we needed to put
the band together quickly.

22:25.447 --> 22:28.347
So I hired him for $250 a week.

22:44.673 --> 22:46.779
I knew who she was
because I had her album.

22:47.193 --> 22:49.644
I listened to that
album a hundred times.

22:51.128 --> 22:54.649
She could seem vulnerable
and very feminine

22:54.683 --> 22:58.722
but when she opened her mouth to
sing everything got different.

22:58.756 --> 23:01.000
It was just incredible.

23:02.001 --> 23:05.211
You knew that there was
a very solid core

23:05.245 --> 23:07.213
and a very determined woman.

23:17.948 --> 23:19.881
Just saw her walking
past me in the Troubadour

23:19.915 --> 23:20.985
and she looked so cute.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.470
I just grabbed her by the hand

23:22.504 --> 23:24.403
and I said I think you should
cook me dinner.

23:25.231 --> 23:27.716
And she said okay and
gave me her phone number.

23:28.061 --> 23:30.236
So I called her a couple days

23:30.270 --> 23:31.927
and I said, "Well, you gonna
cook me dinner?"

23:31.962 --> 23:33.860
She goes, "Sure,
come on over." I came on over

23:33.895 --> 23:36.553
and she made me a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

23:37.485 --> 23:39.521
And I fell in love with her.

23:39.556 --> 23:41.558
Took her home and the next day
I said,

23:41.592 --> 23:42.904
"Listen, let's go
get your stuff.

23:42.938 --> 23:44.250
You can live here with me."

23:50.290 --> 23:52.914
John David Souther
and Linda Ronstadt.

23:52.948 --> 23:54.156
They were a hot couple.

24:00.266 --> 24:03.614
JD had had a musical duo
with a guy named Glenn Frey.

24:06.755 --> 24:09.862
He was by best friend
and first songwriting partner.

24:11.657 --> 24:14.245
We really did nothing but just
listen to music and play guitars

24:14.280 --> 24:17.594
and try to write songs and
then go to the Troubadour.

24:19.285 --> 24:21.667
Glenn Frey played
pretty good guitar.

24:21.977 --> 24:23.496
So I went and talked to Glenn
and said,

24:23.531 --> 24:25.256
"Do you want to do this
tour with me?"

24:25.291 --> 24:27.120
He said it would be really cool.

24:27.155 --> 24:29.537
He'd never been
on the road before.

24:30.572 --> 24:33.195
Glenn Frey and I shared
the $12 hotel room

24:33.230 --> 24:35.094
with two twin beds in it.

24:35.335 --> 24:37.027
It was a very modest tour.

24:37.061 --> 24:39.029
I mean, I remember
being in station wagons.

24:41.790 --> 24:44.172
Rooming together, Don
and Glenn each discovered

24:44.206 --> 24:46.761
that the other was a good singer
and songwriter.

24:48.176 --> 24:51.938
And that's when they decided to
get together and form a band.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.596
That band became the Eagles.

24:57.323 --> 24:58.807
They wished us well.

24:58.842 --> 25:02.190
John was very supportive,
Linda was supportive

25:02.224 --> 25:04.848
and they basically said
just go for it.

25:07.816 --> 25:09.991
We didn't have much
success with Desperado.

25:10.025 --> 25:13.063
The record company didn't
know what to do with it.

25:13.097 --> 25:15.514
And then Linda
made it into a classic.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.040
I knew the Neil Young
tour was coming

26:34.075 --> 26:36.215
and I thought this'll be
perfect for Linda

26:36.249 --> 26:40.115
because she had sung backup on
his big hit "Heart of Gold."

26:40.150 --> 26:43.084
So I called Neil's manager
and I said,

26:43.118 --> 26:45.776
"Listen, Linda's the right
opening act for this.

26:45.811 --> 26:47.122
You've got to help me out."

26:47.157 --> 26:49.366
And they said, "Well,
Neil's gonna go out alone."

26:55.683 --> 26:59.031
Lo and behold like a week
later he called me and he said,

26:59.065 --> 27:01.067
"Neil's done a few dates
in Canada

27:01.102 --> 27:03.035
and it's getting him too tired.

27:03.069 --> 27:05.347
He now wants an
opening act and you're it.

27:09.006 --> 27:11.008
Linda was quite reluctant
at the time.

27:11.043 --> 27:13.977
She was so worried about the
idea of playing a huge

27:14.011 --> 27:17.118
hockey arena tour at that
point in her career.

27:17.152 --> 27:20.362
But we persuaded her that
this would be a good thing.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.091
Thank you!

27:25.954 --> 27:29.268
You would occasionally get
somebody: "We want Neil!"

27:29.302 --> 27:33.444
But by the time the tour got
going, she was holding her own.

28:21.907 --> 28:25.151
Here's Linda
who I'd never seen live before,

28:25.186 --> 28:28.741
big stage, sold out, huge place.

28:28.948 --> 28:33.194
She comes out there and starts
singing and that voice filled

28:33.228 --> 28:36.784
this arena where I had seen
concerts for a long time.

28:36.818 --> 28:39.441
Nobody filled this arena with
a voice like Linda Ronstadt.

28:39.476 --> 28:41.789
And she just killed it.

28:41.823 --> 28:46.138
She slaughtered this crowd
who didn't come to see her

28:46.172 --> 28:48.243
but they sure left
knowing who she was.

28:50.901 --> 28:53.766
We did 78 dates in 90 days.

28:54.042 --> 28:57.459
We played before 18,000 to
20,000 people every night.

29:01.015 --> 29:03.845
We got to Houston and there
was this new girl singer.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.157
Her name's Emmylou.

29:06.572 --> 29:10.093
It was 1973 during the
one tour I did with Gram.

29:18.204 --> 29:19.965
Emmy started singing
and three notes

29:19.999 --> 29:21.932
the entire place was dead quiet.

29:21.967 --> 29:24.417
It was like they had started
mass or something.

29:25.487 --> 29:27.558
And she was beautiful,
this girl with the long hair

29:27.593 --> 29:29.353
and big brown eyes
and I thought

29:29.388 --> 29:31.977
she's doing exactly
what I'm doing.

29:32.011 --> 29:33.426
She's doing it better.

29:36.015 --> 29:38.466
And for a minute I thought
well I can get jealous

29:38.500 --> 29:40.882
and then I won't be able
to enjoy her singing.

29:41.193 --> 29:43.195
Or I can just become
a slobbering, drooling fan

29:43.229 --> 29:45.266
like the rest of the people
in the club.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.993
And hope that maybe I
could get her to sing with me.

29:48.027 --> 29:51.237
So I chose the latter as one of
the best decisions I ever made.

29:51.272 --> 29:54.965
And Emmy and I became immediate
music and social friends.

29:57.416 --> 30:02.317
Linda had a lot to do
with lifting me up

30:02.352 --> 30:04.906
at a very, very low
time in my life.

30:06.459 --> 30:09.946
I had been kind of my way
working with Gram Parsons.

30:09.980 --> 30:12.224
I thought I'd found my voice,

30:12.258 --> 30:15.123
I had found something I love
to do singing with him.

30:22.234 --> 30:24.063
On the road to getting
himself straight

30:24.098 --> 30:27.653
he was drinking a lot less,
he was loving the work,

30:27.687 --> 30:31.174
we loved singing together, we
had a record we'd just made,

30:31.208 --> 30:35.454
and apparently someone showed up
with heroin

30:35.488 --> 30:40.148
which he hadn't done
in a while and it killed him.

30:41.046 --> 30:44.359
It was devastating
to lose him like that.

30:45.947 --> 30:50.055
It was Linda who stepped up
as a friend

30:50.089 --> 30:52.160
and we had just met each other.

30:52.195 --> 30:56.544
She brought me out to LA,
had me stay at her house

30:56.578 --> 30:58.718
and she talked about me
to everybody.

30:58.753 --> 31:02.999
Said how great I was and
genuinely loved my singing.

31:03.033 --> 31:07.624
Genuinely made me feel like
I had something to offer

31:07.658 --> 31:11.386
at a very low time in my life.

31:46.180 --> 31:49.735
Linda was always
very tight with her girlfriends.

31:49.769 --> 31:52.186
They sang together, they
shared music together, she was

31:52.220 --> 31:54.119
supportive of me.

31:54.395 --> 31:59.124
I was writing songs and hoping
to make my own record

31:59.158 --> 32:02.575
but of course Linda was
really coming into her own

32:02.610 --> 32:05.233
and starting to be
really successful.

32:07.201 --> 32:09.410
I think a songwriter
doing their songs is different

32:09.444 --> 32:11.619
than a singer do their songs.

32:11.653 --> 32:14.346
Some people prefer the
songwriter doing them, some

32:14.380 --> 32:17.142
people prefer Linda doing them.

32:17.383 --> 32:18.764
But "Lose Again"
she definitely made

32:18.798 --> 32:20.662
into a bigger song.

32:27.462 --> 32:28.947
Because I couldn't
sing it like that.

32:37.058 --> 32:40.579
I mean Linda came out and turned
it into this power ballad.

33:06.639 --> 33:09.780
Back then there wasn't
competition with women.

33:09.815 --> 33:11.506
So I think, you know, women,

33:11.541 --> 33:13.198
there weren't that
many of us either.

33:13.232 --> 33:16.442
So I think there was a certain
amount of banding together

33:16.477 --> 33:19.066
to sort of share
our woman part of it.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.999
This is a song
off our new album.

33:22.517 --> 33:25.244
It's about a real special
place called home.

33:26.383 --> 33:28.316
That's a Karla Bonoff song.

33:29.248 --> 33:32.458
I had made a demo of Home
and we sent it off to Bonnie,

33:32.493 --> 33:35.737
just a complete long shot,
and she decided to record it.

33:58.381 --> 34:01.349
Linda and I are like
sisters, around the same age

34:01.384 --> 34:03.351
and we were coming up
and had the same mutual

34:03.386 --> 34:05.250
other musician friends
and band members

34:05.284 --> 34:08.804
and, you know,
it was a community of artists,

34:08.839 --> 34:12.498
it wasn't sexually divided
between just the women and men.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.328
We weren't thinking
in terms of that.

34:15.398 --> 34:18.608
Linda and Bonnie Raitt
were two of the first women

34:18.641 --> 34:21.679
that I was able to see
as a young journalist

34:21.714 --> 34:24.683
and study the way they operated
in this community.

34:25.235 --> 34:27.513
We're going to move into this
world where we're running bands

34:27.547 --> 34:30.827
with guys in them but we can
also look after each other.

34:31.862 --> 34:35.176
I said if I can have it
on my terms and you understand

34:35.210 --> 34:39.179
I'm not going to be told how to
dress or what music to make.

34:39.215 --> 34:40.456
Great!

34:40.492 --> 34:43.357
We were all throwing away all
those conventions, you know.

34:45.324 --> 34:48.188
The rock and roll culture is so
male dominated and it also seems

34:48.224 --> 34:51.606
to be dominated by sort of
hostility against women.

34:51.641 --> 34:53.608
That this sort of...

34:55.369 --> 35:00.512
sort of sexual identity that is
sort of used as a weapon

35:00.546 --> 35:02.686
against the populace
and women in particular

35:02.721 --> 35:04.654
and then everyone
identifies with it.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.760
And it's sort of sad to me
because what happens is that...

35:09.555 --> 35:14.181
is that rock and roll stars
end up isolating themselves

35:14.215 --> 35:16.873
more and more and more, thereby
increasing their own feelings of

35:16.907 --> 35:20.497
alienation and anxiety and they
wonder why they're so miserable.

35:20.532 --> 35:24.260
That's really when they turn to
drugs and destroy themselves.

35:24.294 --> 35:26.779
It's just very silly.
It just seems very silly.

35:26.814 --> 35:33.269
They lose the ability to focus
on themselves as a person

35:33.303 --> 35:37.652
rather than as an image and
that's very dangerous I think.

35:37.687 --> 35:40.483
And there are always a lot
of people around them,

35:40.517 --> 35:45.246
managers and scene makers,
you know, groupies and whatever,

35:45.281 --> 35:48.215
that are willing to indulge
them in anything they want.

35:48.249 --> 35:51.873
It weakens them,
it weakens them as people

35:51.908 --> 35:54.152
and it eventually weakens
them as musicians.

36:37.850 --> 36:40.646
I was in New York
and somebody said

36:40.681 --> 36:42.821
you have to go see this girl,
she's amazing.

36:42.855 --> 36:45.237
She's one of the best singers
you'll ever hear,

36:45.272 --> 36:46.652
she's brilliant.

36:47.343 --> 36:50.277
She's incredibly great looking,
she sings barefoot

36:50.311 --> 36:53.728
and will knock you out in every
respect and she did.

37:06.776 --> 37:09.296
I was running
the Beatles record label Apple.

37:09.330 --> 37:11.850
When Apple started to fall apart
and the Beatles were breaking up

37:11.884 --> 37:14.956
and all of that
I went to America

37:14.991 --> 37:16.855
and there I was being a manager.

37:18.097 --> 37:20.824
I wanted to go back
to work as a record producer

37:20.859 --> 37:23.275
so I suggested Linda go
and meet with Peter

37:23.310 --> 37:26.036
which we did and he agreed
to manage her.

37:27.866 --> 37:29.316
There was a high bar there.

37:29.350 --> 37:30.869
Peter Asher had hung
around with the Beatles.

37:30.903 --> 37:34.286
He expected to make records
that are huge successes

37:34.321 --> 37:36.530
and he was poised to do that
with Linda

37:36.564 --> 37:38.877
and Geffen was ready to be
their record company

37:38.911 --> 37:40.637
that would be there.

37:43.606 --> 37:46.091
I started Asylum Records
and signed Jackson Browne

37:46.125 --> 37:49.922
and then signing other artists
and it turned into what it did.

37:53.098 --> 37:55.031
And I knew when I saw Linda
and the Stone Poneys

37:55.065 --> 37:56.998
that she was gonna make it
and she was gonna make it

37:57.033 --> 38:00.830
as a solo artist and I knew she
was going to be a big star.

38:01.693 --> 38:03.281
She didn't think so.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.525
She had very little
confidence in those days.

38:08.769 --> 38:10.633
Linda was feeling like
she wasn't good enough

38:10.667 --> 38:12.359
to be on Asylum Records.

38:13.877 --> 38:16.777
I said to her that
that was crazy.

38:18.157 --> 38:20.539
I'm never really
satisfied with what I do.

38:20.919 --> 38:22.955
And lots of times I hear
that I did something wrong

38:22.990 --> 38:25.510
and it bothers me,
it can ruin my day really.

38:25.820 --> 38:28.996
Linda never thought she
was as good as she was

38:29.030 --> 38:31.723
and that is an interesting
paradox

38:31.757 --> 38:33.932
because she's confident
about her ideas

38:33.966 --> 38:36.762
but not about herself
and not about her singing.

38:38.557 --> 38:41.802
My involvement as a producer
with Linda came when she was

38:41.836 --> 38:45.461
having trouble finishing the
album that became Don't Cry Now.

38:46.013 --> 38:49.016
And that's when we decided that
the next album I would produce

38:49.050 --> 38:50.500
was Heart Like a Wheel.

38:59.198 --> 39:02.719
The McGarrigle Sisters, who were
these two Canadian sisters,

39:02.754 --> 39:04.031
they were in an odd category.

39:04.065 --> 39:06.999
They didn't fit in pop music,
they didn't fit in folk music,

39:07.034 --> 39:09.968
they didn't fit anywhere
except they fit in my heart.

39:10.002 --> 39:11.383
We just heard
Heart Like A Wheel,

39:11.418 --> 39:13.040
then I went I have to sing it.

39:31.092 --> 39:35.545
Linda has the ability
to hear a song and claim it.

39:35.752 --> 39:37.754
You claim it as your own
as a singer.

39:37.789 --> 39:40.723
If you love it like that
you get inside it.

39:40.757 --> 39:42.069
You become it.

40:01.916 --> 40:03.780
Heart Like a Wheel,
she discovered that song,

40:03.815 --> 40:05.161
brought it to me and I loved it.

40:05.195 --> 40:07.750
I thought it was beautiful
but I was also thinking

40:07.784 --> 40:09.476
in terms of we should
make some hits.

40:17.553 --> 40:19.209
I'm a ballad singer,
I like to sing ballads best

40:19.244 --> 40:22.040
but we needed some up-tempo
songs for the record

40:22.074 --> 40:23.904
and as an afterthought
I had this song

40:23.938 --> 40:26.562
that we'd used
to close the show.

40:41.749 --> 40:43.993
She knew and loved the song,
I knew and loved the song,

40:44.027 --> 40:47.134
and we decided to do
a version of that song.

40:49.861 --> 40:54.072
I stayed up all night assembling
this very complicated,

40:54.106 --> 40:57.144
intricate layered guitar piece.

40:57.662 --> 41:00.975
We worked very long into
like the next afternoon.

41:01.528 --> 41:03.909
And that's when Linda turned up
and didn't like it.

41:05.601 --> 41:08.155
She said, "Oh, I don't like it.
It sounds like the Beatles,"

41:08.189 --> 41:09.674
which it did sound
like the Beatles

41:09.708 --> 41:11.296
but in the end she came around
and said,

41:11.330 --> 41:13.643
"You know what, I was wrong.
It's great."

41:35.769 --> 41:37.218
Every song
that I sing has a face

41:37.253 --> 41:39.117
that I sing it to, you know.

41:39.151 --> 41:43.742
And so when something
happens to me,

41:43.777 --> 41:45.606
it's really funny,
I know so many songs.

41:45.641 --> 41:47.125
When something happens to me

41:47.159 --> 41:48.920
the song will occur
at the same time.

41:48.954 --> 41:50.646
I'll think oh, this song
or that song, you know.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.924
And if it's a song I can sing
then I'll have to sing it,

41:52.958 --> 41:55.892
I'll just burn to sing it.
I can't not sing it.

42:12.219 --> 42:15.187
He would make the assumption
that I was choosing the songs

42:15.222 --> 42:17.673
that we would do on these
records or that I was working

42:17.707 --> 42:20.020
out the arrangements
or this, that, and the other.

42:20.054 --> 42:21.849
And I would have to keep
explaining that

42:21.884 --> 42:24.576
it was Linda and me
in that order.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.722
My sister used to play
all these Hank Williams records.

42:32.757 --> 42:35.173
So I thought I can do that.

42:46.805 --> 42:48.842
Linda knew a good song

42:48.876 --> 42:50.637
and she knew why it was good
and better than that

42:50.671 --> 42:52.708
she knew how to sing it
better than you can sing.

42:52.742 --> 42:57.195
When you become that sharp
of a song stylist,

42:57.229 --> 43:00.163
you get authorship
in a certain way.

43:00.198 --> 43:02.752
I consider her a real author.

43:02.787 --> 43:06.307
She didn't write songs
but she made songs happen

43:06.342 --> 43:07.688
the way she wanted to hear them.

43:13.660 --> 43:15.731
I Can't Help it
if I'm Still in Love With You

43:15.765 --> 43:17.629
was a hit on the country charts.

43:18.078 --> 43:21.391
You're No Good was a hit on both
the R&B chart and the pop chart.

43:22.254 --> 43:25.154
So I became the first artist to
have a hit on all three charts

43:25.188 --> 43:26.776
at the same time.

43:31.229 --> 43:34.888
Heart Like A Wheel was
a huge turning point for her.

43:35.751 --> 43:40.790
The avalanche of success
was hitting everywhere.

43:41.032 --> 43:43.448
She was at the forefront
of a kind of pop stardom

43:43.482 --> 43:46.106
that hadn't happened
at that point

43:46.140 --> 43:50.662
but people didn't notice the
difficulty of being a woman,

43:50.697 --> 43:54.390
trailblazing and having
the success of a Mick Jagger.

44:26.008 --> 44:28.320
Now I had gigs
like in big sporting arenas,

44:28.355 --> 44:30.426
you know,
stadiums and stuff like that.

44:30.944 --> 44:33.187
I knew the name of every
arena in the country.

44:33.222 --> 44:35.224
We got a gig tonight
at the Spectrum in Philly.

44:35.258 --> 44:36.259
We'll be at the Forum.

44:36.294 --> 44:37.467
Gig tomorrow night
at the Garden.

44:37.502 --> 44:38.468
That's where we played.

44:38.503 --> 44:40.091
She was selling them all out.

44:47.270 --> 44:48.755
She was very good.

44:48.789 --> 44:49.859
Audience loved her.

44:49.894 --> 44:50.826
Records sold.

44:50.860 --> 44:54.001
She was on an uphill swing
all the time.

45:03.252 --> 45:04.943
When we did that tour together

45:04.978 --> 45:07.118
we'd take turns
closing and opening.

45:09.154 --> 45:12.295
You know. Try following
Linda Ronstadt every night.

45:24.307 --> 45:26.344
I went to go see her
at the Universal Amphitheater

45:26.378 --> 45:28.311
when she was wearing
her Boy Scouts outfit

45:28.346 --> 45:29.934
and was just rocking.

45:33.075 --> 45:35.525
Linda was able to be
really feminine and sexy

45:35.560 --> 45:40.323
in this world of men and somehow
hold onto herself and do that

45:40.358 --> 45:43.223
and use that in the
best possible way.

45:54.855 --> 45:58.238
There was a lot of dudes running
around the stages then.

45:58.272 --> 46:01.482
But we were on the road
with Linda and killing it.

46:01.517 --> 46:02.794
She was killing every night.

46:08.317 --> 46:10.353
I know they liked my singing
and I know they were proud

46:10.388 --> 46:12.873
of what they were doing
but still in rock and roll

46:12.908 --> 46:15.393
the idea that you're actually
working for a chick singer,

46:15.427 --> 46:18.016
in their way they sort of
saw it as not as cool

46:18.051 --> 46:19.535
as if they were their own
rock and roll band

46:19.569 --> 46:21.261
and they were just
all the guys.

46:26.576 --> 46:28.613
There weren't a lot
of women musicians

46:28.647 --> 46:31.236
so it was always a band of guys.

46:31.271 --> 46:34.481
There weren't women bass players
and women guitar players

46:34.515 --> 46:38.243
and sometimes some of these
guys were, they were tough.

46:40.383 --> 46:42.420
I got a lot tougher
and more foul mouthed.

46:42.454 --> 46:43.421
I used to swear a lot.

46:43.455 --> 46:44.940
I mean, I used to talk
like a truck driver.

46:44.974 --> 46:47.597
When I think about the way
I used to talk, I'm shocked.

46:51.015 --> 46:53.465
Without having any other
girls along on the road,

46:53.500 --> 46:56.399
just automatically
you start to imitate them.

46:59.644 --> 47:03.096
Linda was never
comfortable being on the road

47:03.130 --> 47:08.135
but obviously she did her job
and part of her loved it.

47:08.170 --> 47:09.309
Who wouldn't love it?

47:09.343 --> 47:12.105
But I think there was another
part of her that went,

47:12.139 --> 47:14.279
"You know,
this doesn't feel right."

47:16.040 --> 47:17.455
If I were going to
choose something to do

47:17.489 --> 47:19.422
it would not be to stand up
in front of a lot of people.

47:19.457 --> 47:21.183
But I love to sing,
I love to sing.

47:21.217 --> 47:23.461
I love music so at some point
you do whatever you have to do

47:23.495 --> 47:25.221
to do music.

47:26.671 --> 47:29.501
She would confess to me that if
she saw people in the front row

47:29.536 --> 47:33.126
and somebody leans over
and says something to the person

47:33.160 --> 47:36.508
next to them, she thought they
were saying, you know,

47:36.543 --> 47:38.614
she's the worst singer
I've ever heard.

47:38.648 --> 47:40.098
I don't like this.

47:40.374 --> 47:42.100
She really believed that.

47:43.481 --> 47:46.173
You get on the bus at
night, card game going on,

47:46.208 --> 47:48.175
everybody blasting music

47:48.210 --> 47:50.453
or everyone else drinking,
you know.

47:50.488 --> 47:52.317
A lot of drugs around.

47:53.042 --> 47:55.424
A lot of people would go on
stage completely hammered,

47:55.458 --> 47:57.219
completely fucking hammered.

47:57.253 --> 48:01.016
Everybody was up at night
and when the gig ended

48:01.050 --> 48:03.018
you don't go home and have milk.

48:04.536 --> 48:08.057
It was kind of the nighttime
danger fun part about

48:08.092 --> 48:09.679
not having to go to bed.

48:09.714 --> 48:11.681
You know, Keith Richards
can do it, so can I.

48:11.716 --> 48:14.443
Linda's thing was diet pills.

48:16.134 --> 48:18.343
She went through a phase
mostly taking speed

48:18.378 --> 48:21.036
and not eating and being
super skinny.

48:21.691 --> 48:25.040
It seemed like it was so hard
to be out there day after day

48:25.074 --> 48:27.042
and to try to get up the energy
to sort of do that

48:27.076 --> 48:30.114
when you were just wrung out

48:30.148 --> 48:33.151
from the sense of being
dislocated from place.

48:35.188 --> 48:37.707
I was with a bunch of people
that were basically earnest

48:37.742 --> 48:39.226
and basically honest

48:39.261 --> 48:42.057
and the kind of paranoia
that was introduced by drugs

48:42.091 --> 48:44.059
was so destructive in our
ability to communicate

48:44.093 --> 48:44.956
with each other.

48:44.991 --> 48:47.096
That really saddened me.

48:47.131 --> 48:50.410
And then at some point
we all just stopped.

49:56.683 --> 50:00.135
When Rolling Stone was ready to
put Linda Ronstadt on the cover

50:00.169 --> 50:03.448
that was her absolute peak
up until then.

50:07.314 --> 50:10.248
Generally it was a very
male-oriented

50:10.283 --> 50:12.664
denim-clad warrior cover.

50:14.459 --> 50:16.392
So here comes Linda Ronstadt

50:16.427 --> 50:20.396
and she and Annie Leibovitz
put together this photo session

50:20.431 --> 50:22.605
that was like no other
cover that had been

50:22.640 --> 50:24.573
on Rolling Stone before.

50:26.609 --> 50:28.542
She was honest

50:31.407 --> 50:33.547
and opened her heart.

50:34.410 --> 50:38.483
She said, "This gets lonely and
I don't know where it ends up.

50:38.725 --> 50:40.554
It's an emotional journey

50:40.589 --> 50:42.591
and I'm happy that I brought
this kind of joy.

50:42.625 --> 50:44.248
But you know what?
When I'm here alone

50:44.282 --> 50:48.114
in this Malibu home that looks
very cozy, it's lonely."

50:49.218 --> 50:51.703
There's a lot of show business
people down here, you know.

50:51.738 --> 50:53.671
It's not my style exactly.

50:53.705 --> 50:56.501
Where did you live before?

50:56.536 --> 50:59.435
Nowhere really. I was on the
road for about ten years

50:59.470 --> 51:02.473
and I didn't exactly have
a home.

51:22.700 --> 51:25.358
Singing the National
Anthem here at Dodger Stadium,

51:25.392 --> 51:27.360
Ms. Linda Ronstadt.

51:34.229 --> 51:37.611
I remember my dad was watching
her at the game.

51:37.646 --> 51:39.751
She sang the National Anthem.

51:46.172 --> 51:47.656
All of sudden there she is.

51:47.690 --> 51:50.555
She'd come in the limo straight
to the restaurant from the game

51:50.590 --> 51:52.247
to have something to eat.

51:53.386 --> 51:56.527
My parents had a small
restaurant on Melrose Avenue

51:56.561 --> 51:59.737
across the street from what
was then KHJ Radio

51:59.771 --> 52:02.153
which was the radio
station in the day.

52:02.774 --> 52:05.674
Linda walked in and my dad
was wearing a shirt

52:05.708 --> 52:08.504
that we call in Mexico Aloe Vera

52:08.539 --> 52:11.921
and it has four pockets
and it's white and she said,

52:11.956 --> 52:13.302
"This is a good place

52:13.337 --> 52:15.477
because he's wearing
the shirt my dad wears.

52:16.340 --> 52:18.411
A lot of the people
who hung out at the Troubadour

52:18.445 --> 52:20.413
also ate at Lucy's.

52:21.241 --> 52:24.451
Lucy was very shall we say
loose with the check

52:24.486 --> 52:26.867
now and again
and if we were on hard times.

52:27.937 --> 52:31.320
Our customers were not
just soon-to-be celebrities

52:31.355 --> 52:34.668
of the industries, they were the
oligarch of Los Angeles.

52:34.703 --> 52:37.361
I mean, you're talking
old-school money.

52:38.776 --> 52:40.502
There was a big
communal table that my father

52:40.536 --> 52:41.641
used to sit everybody at.

52:41.675 --> 52:43.850
So you'd sit with policemen,
you'd sit with firemen,

52:43.884 --> 52:46.473
sometimes you'd sit with an
actor, sometimes you'd sit...

52:46.508 --> 52:49.304
a football player. You never
had any idea who you'd sit with.

52:49.338 --> 52:52.410
What happened was Linda
had decided

52:52.445 --> 52:54.412
that she wanted to change
the 8-track

52:54.447 --> 52:55.689
because she wanted to hear
something else.

52:55.724 --> 52:59.279
So she had to step up
on this little wine rack

52:59.314 --> 53:02.420
and at that moment the Governor
Jerry Brown comes in

53:02.455 --> 53:06.459
that room and he sees her
and it was like wow!

53:06.493 --> 53:07.701
Who's she?

53:08.530 --> 53:11.878
So my father went
and he sat them together.

53:13.362 --> 53:14.915
And, well,
he fell in love with her.

53:14.950 --> 53:16.745
There was no question
about that.

53:17.815 --> 53:19.368
Jerry likes passionate music.

53:19.403 --> 53:21.439
He likes passionate music,
passionate women,

53:21.474 --> 53:22.820
that's his deal.

53:23.476 --> 53:25.443
We had a really
good time together.

53:27.859 --> 53:30.276
He went out to run for president
for the last couple of months

53:30.310 --> 53:33.348
and he pending for the fact that
I got to see him on TV

53:33.382 --> 53:35.522
I may have forgot
what he looked like.

53:38.007 --> 53:39.561
But he came back yesterday.

53:39.595 --> 53:40.976
He's gonna make it
all better now.

53:44.428 --> 53:45.946
That's what he told me anyway.

53:45.981 --> 53:47.741
I have yet to see.

53:56.405 --> 53:58.407
Did you have much of a problem
when you're with Jerry Brown

53:58.442 --> 54:01.272
people expecting you
to have political views

54:01.307 --> 54:03.723
along the lines of
Governor Brown?

54:03.757 --> 54:06.381
Whereas you're a
singer, he's a politician.

54:06.415 --> 54:07.934
Our relationship
was completely personal,

54:07.968 --> 54:09.315
it wasn't political at all.

54:09.349 --> 54:11.524
So, you know, he did politics,
I did music.

54:11.558 --> 54:13.871
- Right.
- It's easy to separate that.

54:14.112 --> 54:16.322
You went to South Africa
recently.

54:16.356 --> 54:18.772
Did you receive criticism
for going there?

54:18.807 --> 54:20.947
As far as I was concerned
it was just a gig.

54:20.981 --> 54:23.018
I don't think that if you
disagree with the policies

54:23.052 --> 54:25.538
of the government, which I do
very definitely disagree

54:25.572 --> 54:27.609
with the policies of the
South African government,

54:27.643 --> 54:29.058
I don't think that's enough
of a reason not to go

54:29.093 --> 54:30.336
and play music there.

54:30.370 --> 54:33.028
If I did that I wouldn't be able
to play in the United State

54:33.062 --> 54:35.341
because I don't agree with their
policies about nuclear power,

54:35.375 --> 54:36.583
nuclear warfare.

54:36.618 --> 54:39.655
I mean, my God, we've got this
person running the country

54:39.690 --> 54:41.416
that I completely disagree with.

54:41.450 --> 54:43.901
If I decided that I wasn't
going to play where attitudes

54:43.935 --> 54:47.663
of racism prevailed, I certainly
couldn't play in Australia

54:47.698 --> 54:51.529
or England or lots of places
in the United States,

54:51.564 --> 54:53.842
a lot of places in the American
South or Boston

54:53.876 --> 54:55.533
which is extremely racist.

54:55.568 --> 54:58.467
I went to South Africa, it has a
fascist repressive government.

54:58.502 --> 55:00.020
I'm very interested in
the culture down there.

55:00.055 --> 55:01.056
You just got finished talking.

55:01.090 --> 55:03.369
You say why does anyone
think I'm controversial.

55:03.403 --> 55:05.543
Do you realized what
you've just talked about here?

55:05.578 --> 55:07.821
We've just received all your
political views in one blow.

55:07.856 --> 55:09.858
I'm teasing.
I'm not putting it down.

55:09.892 --> 55:12.343
I don't think my political
views are very controversial.

55:12.378 --> 55:14.414
Who likes nuclear warfare?

55:14.449 --> 55:17.003
I remember her having the Wall
Street Journal in her bag

55:17.037 --> 55:20.006
one time in the 70s when she was
dating Jerry and I went,

55:20.040 --> 55:23.147
you know, I had thought she was
really smart but she's really

55:23.181 --> 55:26.392
well read and very, very up
on a lot of different things.

55:26.426 --> 55:31.051
She's as wide ranging in her
critical intellectual pursuits

55:31.086 --> 55:34.572
as she is in her music pursuits
and you don't find that kind

55:34.607 --> 55:37.955
of depth and eclecticism
in pop music.

55:39.612 --> 55:44.375
Jerry needed somebody that could
be full-time there for him.

55:45.169 --> 55:47.654
You couldn't have two careers
in that family.

55:50.692 --> 55:51.969
There's not enough time.

56:03.567 --> 56:06.086
I mean, the same
reason I never got married.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.641
I don't know, I think
it's hard being a woman

56:08.675 --> 56:10.021
in the music business.

56:10.056 --> 56:13.508
You know,
it's a different kind of life.

56:20.618 --> 56:22.724
Well you don't need to
get married, you what I mean?

56:22.758 --> 56:24.760
It's like we have our own income

56:24.795 --> 56:27.970
and you don't have to have
the state verify

56:28.005 --> 56:29.593
that you love somebody

56:29.627 --> 56:31.595
and when that relationship's
over you leave.

56:31.629 --> 56:33.459
Neither one of us are
really made for marriage

56:33.493 --> 56:36.151
or I think long-term
relationships.

56:36.876 --> 56:38.222
Why did you break up?

56:38.256 --> 56:41.087
I can't remember.
Maybe she could tell you.

56:59.588 --> 57:03.040
My mom wanted to be a scientist
but she had four kids

57:03.074 --> 57:06.215
and I think it was also a little
bit of a disappointment.

57:08.770 --> 57:11.600
She always said to me
go out and have a life.

57:11.635 --> 57:14.465
You don't just have to get
married, there are alternatives.

57:23.785 --> 57:26.891
I have to confess, I got a
really bad crush on this guy.

57:28.099 --> 57:30.895
We had a little romance for a
while but it wasn't long lived.

57:30.930 --> 57:32.863
He dumped me for this pig.

57:32.897 --> 57:35.210
Well, at least
I got his picture.

58:01.961 --> 58:05.620
To present the nominees
for favorite female

58:05.654 --> 58:10.832
in rock and pop are Teddy
Pendergrass and Tanya Tucker.

58:11.108 --> 58:13.524
The nominees are:
Linda Ronstadt.

58:16.596 --> 58:18.322
Ms. Barbara Streisand.

58:20.980 --> 58:22.222
And Donna Summer.

58:23.603 --> 58:24.639
You open the envelope.

58:24.673 --> 58:25.778
I'm too nervous.

58:25.812 --> 58:28.263
I'll do the gentlemanly
thing here and I'll open it.

58:28.297 --> 58:30.886
- If you will read.
- Okay. And the winner is...

58:30.921 --> 58:32.060
Linda Ronstadt.

58:36.582 --> 58:38.204
Linda was the queen.

58:38.238 --> 58:40.620
She was like what
BeyoncÃ© is now.

58:42.657 --> 58:45.280
She was the first female
rock and roll star.

58:52.045 --> 58:54.082
She was the only
female artist the have

58:54.116 --> 58:59.225
five platinum albums in a row
and most of them multi-platinum.

59:03.298 --> 59:05.990
For favorite female
in rock and pop...

59:06.025 --> 59:07.233
Favorite country single...

59:07.267 --> 59:09.338
Blue Bayou by Linda Ronstadt.

59:09.373 --> 59:11.237
- And the winner is...
- Takes another one.

59:11.271 --> 59:14.309
- Linda Ronstadt.
- The winner is Linda Ronstadt.

59:25.838 --> 59:28.357
The nature of being a pop
musician is that you get

59:28.392 --> 59:30.187
these things
that are successful

59:30.221 --> 59:32.292
and you have to sing them
for the rest of your life.

59:32.327 --> 59:33.949
Over and over and over again
and they start sounding

59:33.984 --> 59:35.848
like your washing machine.

59:38.436 --> 59:41.405
I didn't like singing in big
arenas because the sound

59:41.439 --> 59:44.684
was like, you know, you'd hear
the guitar solo that

59:44.719 --> 59:47.273
they played last week still
ringing around the rafters.

59:49.827 --> 59:52.312
So I started looking
for other things to do.

59:56.972 --> 59:59.941
There is this feeling that
she has about the music itself

59:59.975 --> 01:00:02.288
rather than the career itself.

01:00:02.322 --> 01:00:05.912
You know, some people are
just hardcore careerists.

01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:07.949
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:00:08.674 --> 01:00:12.022
You know, it's how your mind
works that makes the difference.

01:00:12.056 --> 01:00:15.888
It's how you see yourself or how
you see yourself in the world,

01:00:15.922 --> 01:00:16.958
you know.

01:00:16.992 --> 01:00:20.340
And not everybody's
a pure art for art's sake

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:22.342
and not everybody's
a pure careerist either,

01:00:22.377 --> 01:00:23.481
especially in music

01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:27.071
because musicians love music
or they wouldn't do it.

01:00:30.074 --> 01:00:31.766
She wanted to change.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.182
She got tired
of doing arena rock,

01:00:34.216 --> 01:00:36.115
she wanted to try
different things.

01:00:38.048 --> 01:00:40.222
I picked up the phone and called
my great friend John Rockwell

01:00:40.257 --> 01:00:43.329
who writes music criticism
for the New York Times.

01:00:44.364 --> 01:00:46.884
I said I hate playing
these big sporting arenas.

01:00:46.919 --> 01:00:49.646
It's not good for the audience,
it's not good for the band.

01:00:49.887 --> 01:00:53.097
I want to sing in a theater
with a proscenium and a curtain.

01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:55.306
He said well the next time
you come to New York

01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:58.309
I'll take you down to meet this
fellow named Joseph Papp.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:00.933
He has a theater, it's called
the New York Public Theater

01:01:00.967 --> 01:01:04.074
and he does Shakespeare and he
does musicals; he did Hair.

01:01:04.764 --> 01:01:07.077
He wanted to do
The Pirates of Penzance.

01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:10.045
My mom was
a Gilbert and Sullivan lover.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.393
She had a big book of Gilbert
and Sullivan songs on the piano.

01:01:14.015 --> 01:01:17.984
And I actually learned all
the soprano parts as a kid.

01:01:18.433 --> 01:01:20.400
And I loved singing them

01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:22.989
but I never got a chance to
in rock and roll.

01:01:23.749 --> 01:01:26.959
That was in her roots,
that was in her upbringing,

01:01:26.993 --> 01:01:30.687
it was part of her authentic
musical experience.

01:01:31.998 --> 01:01:34.173
Joe called me and
said if I wanted to do the part

01:01:34.207 --> 01:01:35.726
I could have it.

01:01:35.761 --> 01:01:37.245
And I said no I have to come
and audition

01:01:37.279 --> 01:01:39.350
because I didn't know whether
I could sing it or not.

01:01:40.179 --> 01:01:43.044
She wanted to be certain
that she would do it well.

01:01:43.285 --> 01:01:45.218
They thought being able to say
Linda Ronstadt's in it

01:01:45.253 --> 01:01:47.186
would be good for business.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.258
But her concern was whether
it would be good for the show.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.989
I was there for several
rehearsals and she was fabulous.

01:01:57.023 --> 01:01:59.405
She just grabbed it
by the horns and...

01:02:04.997 --> 01:02:06.446
That was the first job
I was ever offered

01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:07.758
where I actually got
to sing like that.

01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:10.450
I was delighted, I really was.
But I can't do it very well yet.

01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:12.280
Because it's really hard.
You can't learn that overnight.

01:02:12.314 --> 01:02:14.938
- You got to be in training.
- In training, yup.

01:02:18.562 --> 01:02:22.946
Linda had a great voice and she
had a great vision for herself

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.466
and she didn't want to just
be singing rock and roll,

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:28.089
she wanted to do everything.

01:02:47.487 --> 01:02:49.558
I knew some of her songs, sure.

01:02:49.593 --> 01:02:52.182
But operetta?

01:02:59.603 --> 01:03:01.847
A week into rehearsal we all
sang through the score

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:04.125
just sitting in a circle
in chairs

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:08.232
and when I heard her voice
it was just

01:03:08.267 --> 01:03:14.825
this belle canto soprano
gorgeous musical,

01:03:16.275 --> 01:03:19.623
celestial yet earthy, just pure,

01:03:19.657 --> 01:03:22.177
something so pure,
it just made me cry.

01:03:22.212 --> 01:03:24.352
I just remember just listening
to that voice,

01:03:24.386 --> 01:03:27.044
it was just singing
that stuff...

01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:30.979
Touching.

01:03:49.342 --> 01:03:51.517
Gilbert and Sullivan? Really?

01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:54.865
A rock star who has the guts
to go out there

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.213
and do that kind of
musical comedy.

01:03:58.248 --> 01:03:59.352
She just didn't care.

01:03:59.387 --> 01:04:02.562
To her it was like
a mountain to climb.

01:04:18.302 --> 01:04:20.926
Linda can bring
herself to sing anything.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.584
She could sing opera, she could
do anything with her voice.

01:04:24.619 --> 01:04:26.310
I couldn't do all that.

01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:41.015
Kevin Kline and I
were both nominated

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:42.568
for Tony Awards for that show.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.535
Kevin deserved it
more than I did.

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:46.468
All I did was walk
around and sing.

01:04:53.406 --> 01:04:55.581
My mom died during
Pirates of Penzance.

01:04:57.514 --> 01:04:59.481
I wasn't with her when she died.

01:04:59.516 --> 01:05:02.001
And I just couldn't quite
get it through my head

01:05:02.036 --> 01:05:03.278
that she was gone
out of the world

01:05:03.313 --> 01:05:05.211
and I was never going
to see her again.

01:05:07.973 --> 01:05:10.216
She'd had all these records --
Louis Armstrong,

01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:12.046
Ella Fitzgerald,

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.151
Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee.

01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:16.913
And I thought I'd like to try
to sing some of those songs.

01:05:22.332 --> 01:05:25.507
When we lived together almost
every evening the last record

01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:27.475
we listened to was
a Frank Sinatra album

01:05:27.509 --> 01:05:29.580
called Songs for
Only the Lonely.

01:05:29.615 --> 01:05:31.962
With Nelson Riddle arranging.

01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:38.313
Constantly people were telling
Linda you can't do this.

01:05:38.658 --> 01:05:40.039
I'm guilty.

01:05:40.074 --> 01:05:42.731
When she was going to do
the Nelson Riddle album

01:05:42.766 --> 01:05:45.217
I didn't think it was
a good idea,

01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:47.115
not because she
couldn't do it

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:50.670
but because we had this run
going with rock and roll records

01:05:50.705 --> 01:05:52.224
and country rock.

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:55.503
I said I'd like to find somebody
that can write arrangements

01:05:55.537 --> 01:05:56.953
like Nelson Riddle.

01:05:57.332 --> 01:06:00.094
They said why don't you
just ask Nelson Riddle?

01:06:00.715 --> 01:06:03.166
Well I didn't know
he was still alive.

01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:05.582
You were the only person
that I knew that could do

01:06:05.616 --> 01:06:07.342
orchestrations like this.

01:06:07.377 --> 01:06:08.654
I didn't know where you were,

01:06:08.688 --> 01:06:10.587
whether you'd be interested
in working with me.

01:06:10.621 --> 01:06:12.520
Whether you'd ever
heard of me or not.

01:06:12.554 --> 01:06:14.246
And as soon as I started
learning the songs

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.626
they just got inside me.

01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:17.249
I wanted to record them
and I wanted to do it

01:06:17.283 --> 01:06:19.182
worse than anything
I've ever wanted to do.

01:06:19.216 --> 01:06:20.562
I remember your phrase for this.

01:06:20.597 --> 01:06:24.290
You said these are
songs I cannot not do.

01:06:24.325 --> 01:06:25.671
I can't not do them.

01:06:25.705 --> 01:06:28.432
At some point
it's like falling in love.

01:06:28.467 --> 01:06:30.089
Choice doesn't
even enter into it.

01:06:42.412 --> 01:06:44.621
I would think oh my God,
how can I sing these songs?

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:47.141
Ella Fitzgerald has sung them,
Billie Holiday has sing them,

01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:49.074
Frank Sinatra has sung them.

01:06:55.218 --> 01:06:57.047
She studied all of those records

01:06:57.082 --> 01:06:59.705
and she studied every available
version she could find

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:01.396
of each one of those songs.

01:07:01.431 --> 01:07:03.364
She is a real student.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:16.239
She told she wanted to get
those songs out of the elevator.

01:07:16.273 --> 01:07:19.104
She meant that that's the
only place you heard them.

01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:22.314
And she wanted to point out that
that's not where they belong.

01:07:22.348 --> 01:07:24.454
They were some of the
best songs ever written.

01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:33.152
I went to her house and
tried to talk her out of it but

01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:36.328
as soon as she told me Nelson
Riddle was going to do it,

01:07:36.362 --> 01:07:39.538
I said well I'd like
to come to the record session.

01:07:49.168 --> 01:07:50.894
When my sister was
in high school she got to go

01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:53.310
to her senior prom and she got
to wear these strapless dresses

01:07:53.345 --> 01:07:54.691
with a lot of tool

01:07:54.725 --> 01:07:56.865
and I always wanted
one of those dresses.

01:07:58.798 --> 01:08:00.697
By the time I got to high school

01:08:00.731 --> 01:08:03.148
styles had changed
and I never got to have one.

01:08:03.182 --> 01:08:04.666
So I said I'm going to put
a show together,

01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:06.703
we're all going to get to wear
those dresses.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:25.894
This is a real treat tonight.

01:08:25.929 --> 01:08:27.862
We have three marvelous singers
on the show

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:30.727
and would you know how many
times they have been nominated

01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:32.176
for Grammys between them?

01:08:32.211 --> 01:08:33.799
Forty-five times in total.

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.219
The albums they've all sold
are in the multi-millions

01:08:40.254 --> 01:08:42.428
and I guess it's taken
the ladies about ten years

01:08:42.462 --> 01:08:44.603
to get this together where they
wanted to work together

01:08:44.636 --> 01:08:48.676
and made an album called Trio
and it was well worth the time.

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.919
The album is described as
old-timey but it's sensational.

01:08:50.953 --> 01:08:52.783
Would you welcome
Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton,

01:08:52.818 --> 01:08:53.921
Emmylou Harris?

01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:03.484
I had met Dolly.

01:09:03.518 --> 01:09:05.348
I saw her singing
on the Grand Ole Opry

01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:06.658
and she was a wonder to behold.

01:09:06.694 --> 01:09:09.490
What you have in front of you is
one of the most beautiful girls

01:09:09.524 --> 01:09:10.662
you've ever seen.

01:09:10.698 --> 01:09:12.389
She's just gorgeous.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.633
When she opened her mouth
and started to sing

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:15.772
I fell on the floor.

01:09:15.805 --> 01:09:17.670
She's an amazing singer.

01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:30.787
I told
Emmylou about her

01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:32.720
and then Emmy
met her somehow.

01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:38.381
When I made my first trip to
Nashville the powers that be

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:41.279
set up a meeting with Dolly
and she was making a record

01:09:41.314 --> 01:09:44.524
in her studio
and it was like unbelievable.

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:47.390
It was better than
any Disneyland visit.

01:09:49.737 --> 01:09:51.703
They kind of found
my music somewhere

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:54.017
and kind of wanted
to meet me

01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:56.330
and that's kind of how
we all started.

01:09:57.331 --> 01:09:59.367
Emmy called me up and she's like
Dolly Parton's at my house,

01:09:59.402 --> 01:10:00.989
you have to come over.

01:10:01.024 --> 01:10:02.784
I was living like
40 minutes away

01:10:02.819 --> 01:10:04.510
and I got there in 20 minutes.

01:10:04.545 --> 01:10:07.755
She came over and there we were,
the three of us

01:10:07.789 --> 01:10:10.240
and we were there
with our idol Dolly.

01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:12.518
They had this big old house,
almost like a bunch of hippies

01:10:12.553 --> 01:10:15.003
just living up there,
different people and musicians.

01:10:15.038 --> 01:10:16.626
They had different bedrooms.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.593
It was just a
free-for-all kind of house.

01:10:18.628 --> 01:10:20.423
A dream for musicians.

01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:23.943
And somebody said
well sing something.

01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:40.028
So I started singing that

01:10:40.063 --> 01:10:41.720
and then they started saying
sing that again.

01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:43.342
I go "Oh, bury me..."

01:10:43.377 --> 01:10:44.999
And here come
all these harmonies

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:47.657
and oh it was just
chilling, chilling, chilling.

01:11:02.948 --> 01:11:04.915
When we heard our voices

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:08.471
it was like injecting some kind
of serum into your veins.

01:11:08.505 --> 01:11:10.611
It was like a high
like you've never felt.

01:11:10.645 --> 01:11:12.578
We sang first in a living room

01:11:12.613 --> 01:11:14.028
and said well
this sounds really good.

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:15.512
It was special,
it was different.

01:11:15.547 --> 01:11:20.621
It was like a sound of
sisters, musical sisters.

01:11:32.426 --> 01:11:35.636
At that moment we thought
we have to do a record.

01:11:55.518 --> 01:11:57.451
We learned so much
about singing from each other

01:11:57.485 --> 01:11:59.418
because you get to sort of
be them for a second

01:11:59.453 --> 01:12:00.902
when you're shadowing
them in harmony.

01:12:00.937 --> 01:12:04.147
It's like getting on an eagle
and getting to see the world

01:12:04.181 --> 01:12:06.494
through that eagle's experience.

01:12:06.529 --> 01:12:08.151
I get to sing through
Dolly's voice

01:12:08.185 --> 01:12:10.878
or sing through Emmy's voice
when I sing real close harmony.

01:12:22.579 --> 01:12:25.444
The only big disagreements would
be are we going to use autoharp

01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:27.584
or dulcimer on this song.

01:12:27.619 --> 01:12:29.172
- Yeah.

01:12:29.206 --> 01:12:30.898
Sometimes we would disagree
about who would sing lead

01:12:30.932 --> 01:12:32.658
because Emmy and I
always wanted Dolly

01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:34.039
to sing lead on everything.

01:12:34.073 --> 01:12:36.075
Oh, well Dolly will
sound great on that.

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:38.388
You sing lead!
No, you sing lead!

01:12:40.459 --> 01:12:42.530
Linda is such a perfectionist.

01:12:42.565 --> 01:12:44.049
She's a pain in the ass
sometimes

01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:46.431
because she is such
a perfectionist.

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:48.743
Because she will not have it
unless it's perfect.

01:12:48.778 --> 01:12:51.539
She used to make me sing those
harmonies over and over

01:12:51.574 --> 01:12:54.784
and I said I'm going to sing it
the same way no matter what.

01:12:54.818 --> 01:12:56.958
No, you're not! You're going
to hit this one note.

01:12:56.993 --> 01:12:59.789
And see I don't know how to,
all those intricate harmonies

01:12:59.823 --> 01:13:01.446
like Emmylou and Linda do.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.965
I just sing that raw stuff
from feeling

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.244
and it ain't always proper
but it sounds good.

01:13:22.018 --> 01:13:24.917
Linda, you've sing
just about all types of music.

01:13:24.952 --> 01:13:28.231
Light opera; you've been on
Broadway, rock and roll, pop.

01:13:28.265 --> 01:13:30.509
What's your next project
going to be?

01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:32.718
I'm going to do an album
of Mexican music,

01:13:32.753 --> 01:13:33.719
of traditional Mexican music.

01:13:33.754 --> 01:13:36.446
I'm kind of a
traditional Mexican myself.

01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:38.690
You know, I grew up about 40
minutes from the Mexican border,

01:13:38.724 --> 01:13:41.727
my family are Mexican,
and that is my roots.

01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:44.592
That's what I came from
and I have been dying to do

01:13:44.627 --> 01:13:46.042
this record
for years and years

01:13:46.076 --> 01:13:47.630
and I'm getting around
to it this year.

01:13:47.664 --> 01:13:49.770
Boy, I'm going o do it.

01:13:56.984 --> 01:13:59.883
Our neighbor that lived behind
us in the garage apartment

01:13:59.918 --> 01:14:02.610
was Harry Dean Stanton,
great character actor

01:14:02.645 --> 01:14:05.544
and a great singer
of Mexican folk songs.

01:14:05.993 --> 01:14:08.582
We would hear him up until
the wee hours singing

01:14:08.616 --> 01:14:11.550
these Mexican folk songs,
these canciones.

01:14:11.585 --> 01:14:15.174
And Linda knew all those songs.

01:14:15.209 --> 01:14:18.108
I don't think people
thought of her as...

01:14:18.143 --> 01:14:20.594
as Mexican.

01:14:20.904 --> 01:14:23.631
It certainly never came up.
I never heard it.

01:14:23.666 --> 01:14:26.669
I mean, the name
Ronstadt is not Hernandez.

01:14:26.703 --> 01:14:28.533
Ronstadt is a
German-sounding name.

01:14:28.567 --> 01:14:32.537
No, she's certainly
from Mexican heritage

01:14:32.571 --> 01:14:34.884
but it wasn't the most
apparent thing.

01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:36.920
I want to see
where you put your D.

01:14:36.955 --> 01:14:39.544
Say ganador.

01:14:39.578 --> 01:14:41.718
Ga...

01:14:41.753 --> 01:14:44.687
The phrasing, Ganador.

01:14:44.721 --> 01:14:46.896
Ganador.

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:48.760
Ganador.

01:14:48.794 --> 01:14:50.796
- Dor?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:53.696
Is it on the roof of your mouth,
the back of your teeth or...

01:14:54.213 --> 01:14:57.320
When he asked me if I would sing
a harmony on his record

01:14:57.354 --> 01:14:59.149
I was completely delighted

01:14:59.184 --> 01:15:02.567
because you can only learn
by doing. I can't...

01:15:03.015 --> 01:15:04.810
there isn't a book you can get,
you know,

01:15:04.845 --> 01:15:07.813
how do you learn how to be
a singer in Spanish?

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:09.988
It's always been a dream
of mine to make an album

01:15:10.022 --> 01:15:12.956
of these Mexican songs
that I learned from my father.

01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:21.965
My father had a beautiful
baritone voice.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.347
He sounded like
a cross between Pedro Infante

01:15:24.381 --> 01:15:26.211
and Frank Sinatra.

01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:30.008
Always if there was a dinner
party or something he'd get the

01:15:30.042 --> 01:15:33.632
guitar out and he'd just sing
and I always would fall asleep

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:36.877
in somebody's lap listening to
my dad sing some beautiful song.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.261
We always as a family,
we always sang in Spanish.

01:15:42.296 --> 01:15:45.333
Even though I didn't understand
much of what I was singing,

01:15:45.368 --> 01:15:46.921
it was something
that I learned to do.

01:15:46.956 --> 01:15:48.751
It's kind of like lip reading,
you know.

01:15:48.785 --> 01:15:51.995
I used to kind of chameleon in
harmony along with my father.

01:15:57.725 --> 01:16:01.004
To learn to sing that style as
a grown-up professional singer,

01:16:01.039 --> 01:16:02.627
that took some doing.

01:16:30.793 --> 01:16:33.140
I always forget the beginning
where I go through the ending

01:16:33.174 --> 01:16:34.728
and it makes it so hard.

01:16:34.762 --> 01:16:36.384
Oh yeah.
What was it, this way?

01:16:36.419 --> 01:16:37.938
Is that how you do it?
The Latin way.

01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:39.318
Okay, I got it.

01:16:40.941 --> 01:16:42.874
Okay, I'm learning
all these new things.

01:16:50.019 --> 01:16:53.022
My dad invited me to go to the
Tucson Mariachi Conference

01:16:53.056 --> 01:16:55.990
and that way I got to meet
the Mariachi Vargas.

01:16:59.028 --> 01:17:02.100
Those good bands like the Cobre
or the Camperos

01:17:02.134 --> 01:17:04.136
or the Mariachi Vargas, you're
going to go to a symphony

01:17:04.171 --> 01:17:05.931
and you're not going to find
better musicians.

01:17:05.966 --> 01:17:07.899
They're all virtuoso players.

01:17:13.456 --> 01:17:15.354
I picked a couple of songs.

01:17:16.286 --> 01:17:18.392
The band said these songs
are very traditional

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.359
and they're very difficult
to do.

01:17:21.188 --> 01:17:23.017
I said well, they're
the only songs I know

01:17:23.052 --> 01:17:24.950
so we better learn them.

01:17:32.164 --> 01:17:33.959
I went to the president
of my record company,

01:17:33.994 --> 01:17:36.375
who's a man who genuinely
likes music, and I said look,

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:38.170
I made all these records
for you, they saw this.

01:17:38.205 --> 01:17:39.827
I'm going to do this
just for me

01:17:39.862 --> 01:17:40.759
and this might be
self-indulgent.

01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:42.174
If it sells two copies
I don't care

01:17:42.209 --> 01:17:44.694
but if I can't record this music
I'm going to die.

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:48.008
I don't understand any Spanish.

01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:52.012
I didn't understand how popular
those songs were

01:17:52.046 --> 01:17:56.741
but this is a lady who wanted
to do it her way

01:17:56.775 --> 01:17:58.535
and who was going to say no?

01:18:31.327 --> 01:18:34.192
Canciones de mi Padre,
it's the largest selling

01:18:34.226 --> 01:18:37.126
Spanish language album
in the history of the industry.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.923
That's the whole Linda Ronstadt
story right there in a nutshell.

01:18:40.957 --> 01:18:44.098
Linda deciding she wants
to do something,

01:18:44.133 --> 01:18:46.825
the record company telling
her she can't.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.931
She goes ahead
and does it anyway

01:18:48.965 --> 01:18:53.418
and they jump on board
as the thing starts to take off.

01:18:55.006 --> 01:18:57.387
Toda la Familia
would come and they loved it

01:18:57.422 --> 01:19:00.011
because they were here
from Mexico.

01:19:00.045 --> 01:19:03.083
Even though their kids
had grown up here

01:19:03.117 --> 01:19:05.154
and become American citizens,

01:19:05.188 --> 01:19:08.226
who is this girl singing songs
so beautifully.

01:19:17.407 --> 01:19:19.202
The fact that she
went on and did that

01:19:19.237 --> 01:19:21.411
and did it in such a big way.

01:19:21.618 --> 01:19:23.379
It was a brave thing to do.

01:19:23.413 --> 01:19:25.139
Many people would
have been terrified

01:19:25.174 --> 01:19:26.969
I'll mess up my career.

01:19:27.624 --> 01:19:32.388
But obviously she had
purpose, personal decision.

01:19:33.354 --> 01:19:34.493
It's good.

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.879
To have that traditionalism
going along on the bus with me

01:20:14.913 --> 01:20:17.157
from town to town where
I'd only sung pop music,

01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:19.987
to take that part of the dirt
with me, you know,

01:20:20.022 --> 01:20:22.990
the part of the soil of the land
where I came from to Cleveland

01:20:23.025 --> 01:20:25.303
and Cincinnati and New York,
that was a thrill.

01:20:25.337 --> 01:20:27.374
You should have seen
Central Park with, you know,

01:20:27.408 --> 01:20:30.101
close to a million people
in it when the mariachi

01:20:30.135 --> 01:20:32.586
got up on stage with their
big hats, the place fell out.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.071
They went nuts. There
was such a thing of pride

01:20:35.106 --> 01:20:37.142
that went from the stage
to the audience.

01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:38.488
It was just great.

01:20:39.973 --> 01:20:43.286
This song was written
by me and my father

01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:45.841
and it's called
Lo Siento Mi Vida.

01:20:51.674 --> 01:20:53.918
My dad died when he was 84.

01:20:55.402 --> 01:20:58.543
There was a kind of a peace
that happened when he died.

01:21:00.925 --> 01:21:03.099
In the three of four days before
he died he was reading to us

01:21:03.134 --> 01:21:06.344
passages from
Gabriel Garcia Marquez's book

01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:10.003
Love in the Time of Cholera
and it was just a great sharing.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.111
It was a different experience
being with my father

01:21:15.146 --> 01:21:17.389
when he died
than it was with my mother.

01:21:18.632 --> 01:21:21.566
I knew I was going to miss him
but I accepted it better.

01:21:33.336 --> 01:21:35.925
He had what I would
describe as a beautiful death.

01:21:40.309 --> 01:21:42.449
I'd seen her on
TV and I thought she was great

01:21:42.483 --> 01:21:46.004
but when she came to
New Orleans she was just

01:21:46.039 --> 01:21:49.974
so down to earth
and girl next door thing.

01:21:50.353 --> 01:21:52.321
And just humble.

01:21:53.356 --> 01:21:55.634
She was just a sweet,
humble person.

01:21:56.981 --> 01:22:00.122
I'd been in New
Orleans for the World's Fair

01:22:00.156 --> 01:22:01.986
and somebody said well
the Neville Brothers are playing

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:04.022
at some club down
in the Quarter. We should go.

01:22:04.057 --> 01:22:06.231
We going to get
serious, serious right now.

01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:09.303
I'm going to turn you on to
our brother Aaron Neville.

01:22:09.338 --> 01:22:10.546
Aaron Neville
was on stage singing

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:12.479
this beautiful song Arianne.

01:22:29.703 --> 01:22:31.463
Somebody told me
she was in the audience

01:22:31.498 --> 01:22:33.534
so I called her up on stage.

01:22:33.569 --> 01:22:35.433
Sing some doo wop.

01:22:36.089 --> 01:22:37.538
Usually I'll never do
anything like that

01:22:37.573 --> 01:22:39.747
because I like to rehearse
everything first.

01:22:39.782 --> 01:22:42.129
But I wasn't going to say no
to Aaron Neville.

01:22:42.336 --> 01:22:44.718
After that I asked
for an autograph.

01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:47.376
She said To Aaron, Love,
I'll sing with you anytime,

01:22:47.410 --> 01:22:50.275
any place, anywhere in any key.

01:22:58.766 --> 01:23:00.251
The next morning
I woke up

01:23:00.285 --> 01:23:01.769
and my first thought
was boy I like singing

01:23:01.804 --> 01:23:03.461
with Aaron Neville.
That sounded pretty good.

01:23:03.495 --> 01:23:05.290
And then I thought, you idiot,
everybody sounds good

01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:07.327
when they sing
with Aaron Neville.

01:23:08.397 --> 01:23:11.262
I said we got to make a record
together and he was up for it.

01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:34.733
They say oh Linda and Aaron
got married or whatever.

01:23:35.424 --> 01:23:37.046
Just crazy stuff.

01:23:46.469 --> 01:23:48.575
The producer told us
if you don't make it look real

01:23:48.609 --> 01:23:52.096
ain't no sense doing it.
So we had to make it look real.

01:24:05.247 --> 01:24:09.596
At the studio I said I'll
see you at the Grammys.

01:24:14.532 --> 01:24:17.086
I had a speech but

01:24:18.398 --> 01:24:21.642
Too nervous. I just want to
say thank you to Linda first.

01:24:22.712 --> 01:24:24.507
And my wife Joelle.

01:24:26.923 --> 01:24:28.753
Aaron and I won two
Grammys for that record.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.206
But as time went on there was
something really wrong

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.655
with my voice.

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:40.627
I just lost a lot of
different colors in my voice.

01:24:41.559 --> 01:24:43.216
There's a lot of things
you do in singing.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.771
You turn your voice to different
planes to make different sounds

01:24:46.805 --> 01:24:48.600
and I couldn't do any of that.

01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:54.365
Turned out I had
Parkinson's disease.

01:24:56.643 --> 01:24:58.679
Singing is really complex

01:24:58.714 --> 01:25:02.200
and I was made most aware
of it by having it vanish.

01:25:03.339 --> 01:25:06.791
I can still sing in my mind
but I can't do it physically.

01:25:09.173 --> 01:25:13.142
I sang my last concert
on November 7th, 2009.

01:25:13.556 --> 01:25:15.248
It was a Mexican show.

01:25:16.801 --> 01:25:20.770
Must have been
quite a reckoning

01:25:20.805 --> 01:25:23.428
to have this marvelous
instrument

01:25:23.463 --> 01:25:25.327
that could always
hold the notes, hit the notes

01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:26.949
and shape the notes,

01:25:26.983 --> 01:25:29.710
could no longer hold the notes
without quiver.

01:25:31.885 --> 01:25:34.267
But there's a lot of good
records with

01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.958
her magnificent voice on them

01:25:35.992 --> 01:25:38.754
and I hear her laughing
in my head all the time.

01:25:38.788 --> 01:25:40.687
I hear that cackle all the time.

01:25:41.515 --> 01:25:43.448
I'm sort of never without her.

01:25:46.279 --> 01:25:50.421
I could imagine not being
able to sing for Linda is awful.

01:25:50.835 --> 01:25:56.530
But I also know nobody who could
handle that kind of change

01:25:56.565 --> 01:26:00.189
or adjustment in a more
logical and thoughtful

01:26:00.224 --> 01:26:02.536
and intelligent way than Linda.

01:26:04.331 --> 01:26:06.540
I don't think she
misses going on the road.

01:26:06.816 --> 01:26:09.543
I don't think she
misses making records.

01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:14.376
I think she misses
singing with her friends

01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:17.379
and singing in the living room
with her family.

01:26:19.519 --> 01:26:21.417
There's just no one
on the planet

01:26:21.452 --> 01:26:25.594
that ever had or ever will
have a voice like Linda's.

01:26:37.606 --> 01:26:39.470
You know,
I'm grateful for the time I had.

01:26:39.504 --> 01:26:43.198
I got to live a lot of my dreams
and I feel lucky about it.

01:26:46.028 --> 01:26:48.410
Another person with Parkinson's
said that life after death

01:26:48.444 --> 01:26:49.790
isn't the question.

01:26:51.827 --> 01:26:53.691
It's life before death.

01:26:56.418 --> 01:26:57.867
So how are you going to do it?

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:00.663
How are you going to live?

01:27:57.133 --> 01:27:58.687
Couldn't find a part there.

01:27:58.963 --> 01:28:00.447
Start right there.

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:10.630
I don't even have that note
in my speaking range anymore.

01:28:12.356 --> 01:28:15.704
Before you said
you couldn't sing anymore.

01:28:15.738 --> 01:28:17.395
This isn't really singing.

01:28:17.913 --> 01:28:20.812
Believe me,
it's a few notes.

01:28:20.847 --> 01:28:23.608
- But it's not really singing.
- Are you enjoying it?

01:28:23.643 --> 01:28:25.438
Well, I would enjoy it much more
if I could sing

01:28:25.472 --> 01:28:27.405
but I can't let them
sing this without me.

01:28:28.164 --> 01:28:29.890
It's a family thing.

01:28:30.512 --> 01:28:32.790
Shall we?
You guys ready?

01:29:50.454 --> 01:29:52.456
- Do we get to eat?
- Yes.

01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:53.974
Good.
