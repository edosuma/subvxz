<i>Previously on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:06.832 --> 00:08.356
Our marriage is over.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.227
I finally know the direction
that I want to be headed in.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.881
Will you go on a date with me?

00:11.881 --> 00:13.013
<i>Why are you acting like</i>

00:13.013 --> 00:14.927
everything is over
and done with?

00:14.927 --> 00:17.669

you're leaving in six days.

I thought I heard a crash.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.473
Yeah, no, it's fine.

00:38.473 --> 00:42.477
We were just reading up
on the, uh, compliance...

00:42.477 --> 00:43.478

00:55.185 --> 00:56.665
- What?
- You owe me 20 bucks!

00:57.927 --> 00:59.059
Yeah.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.714
Ooh.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.499
I gotta quit using
these stairs.

I don't know what word to use.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.699
Fun.
I haven't had fun

01:30.699 --> 01:32.701
in a long time.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.181

Mm!

01:53.983 --> 01:56.377
I gotta say,

01:56.377 --> 01:59.249
we made damn good use
of my last week in New York.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.904
Mm. You sure I can't
convince you to stay?

02:01.904 --> 02:04.254
Mm, not when they're
handing out

02:04.254 --> 02:06.648
$20,000 bonuses like candy.

02:06.648 --> 02:09.041
Well, I can get you free
coffee at Pain De Vie.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.434
Mm.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.001
You know I got the plug.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.611
Ohh.
Do you?

02:13.611 --> 02:15.396
Yeah.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.138
Oh.
You might get a call today

02:18.138 --> 02:20.314
about a gig in Tanzania.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.926
I, uh--
I listed you as my reference.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.669
Hm.

02:27.669 --> 02:28.800
Tanzania.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.454
I know.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.891
You think you could
sing my praises,

02:32.891 --> 02:35.329
convince 'em I'm a real catch?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.203
Floyd?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.987
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

02:41.987 --> 02:45.165
I'll tell 'em exactly
what they need to hear.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.601
Thank you.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.472
Yeah.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.866
Hi, is this, uh,
Martin McIntyre?

02:50.866 --> 02:52.172
Am I saying that right?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.261
Uh, yeah,
you know who this is.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.697
Yeah, hi.
This is Iggy Frome.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.873
I am your date
for this evening.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.222
Oh, my God.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.964
I need a night out tonight
after this morning.

03:01.964 --> 03:05.359
Sameera and Raffi were
at each other again.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.535
Sameera and Raffi,
what, are those your cats?

03:07.535 --> 03:08.840
'Cause, you know,
you definitely do not want

03:08.840 --> 03:10.668
to be talking about your kids
on a first date.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.366
That's a--
that's a major turnoff,

03:12.366 --> 03:13.541
big no-no.
- Okay, okay,

03:13.541 --> 03:15.325
so you're, uh,
really going full steam

03:15.325 --> 03:17.197
on this fresh start thing, huh?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.633
I'm sorry, have we met?

03:18.633 --> 03:19.895
I think I'd remember
meeting you.

03:19.895 --> 03:20.983
You sound cute.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.289
Okay, stranger, look,

03:22.289 --> 03:23.681
I'm late for my first session.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.075
So can we agree upon
where we're meeting tonight?

03:26.075 --> 03:28.512
Uh, Darnellé or that Persian
place--what do you think?

03:28.512 --> 03:29.992
Hmm, yeah,
I don't know those places.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.473
Those sound like, uh,
old standbys for you,

03:32.473 --> 03:34.562
but, uh, yeah,
I'm drawing a blank.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.128
Iggy.

03:36.128 --> 03:39.219
Hey, tonight, everything
is for the first time.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.437
Since I'm the one
who asked you out,

03:40.437 --> 03:41.395
I'll let you off the hook.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.613
I will pick the place,

03:42.613 --> 03:43.832
I will send you the address,

03:43.832 --> 03:46.051
and I will see you there
at 7:00, okay?

03:46.051 --> 03:47.444
Oh, okay.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.707
- Oh, and Martin?
- Mm-hmm?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.970
<i>I'm really looking forward
to meeting you.</i>

03:54.103 --> 03:55.757
Okay.
See you.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.373
Ugh.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.984
I hate clocking out
when the sun's coming up.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.291
Oh, come on.
You love pancakes for dinner.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.075
Ugh.
How do you have so much energy?

04:10.075 --> 04:12.034
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because I've shed

04:12.034 --> 04:15.429
decades of emotional trauma--
my mom, my sister.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.039
But I am finally out
from underneath it all,

04:17.039 --> 04:19.433
so it is time I made
some big changes in my life.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.695
So...
- Quitting medicine?

04:20.695 --> 04:22.479
- I sold my apartment.
- Oh.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.046
But you're definitely not
moving in with me.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.656
Nah.
- Relax, relax.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.615
No, I actually found the
perfect place in Battery Park.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.051
It ticks all my boxes.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.661
There's actually
an open house at 9:00 a.m.,

04:30.661 --> 04:32.533
but my realtor says
they can sneak me in early.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.361
Wanna come, be my fresh eyes?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.579
Battery Park's
all the way downtown.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.451
We're not gonna make it
before 9:00.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.671
How fast can you get us
to Battery Park?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.673
- Downtown?
- In rush hour?

04:42.673 --> 04:44.545
Well, there's a two bedroom,
two bath

04:44.545 --> 04:46.329
with a view of the Hudson
that's got my name on it

04:46.329 --> 04:47.896
if I can get there
before 9:00 a.m.

04:47.896 --> 04:48.984
- Doorman?
- Check.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.507
- Private rooftop?
- Uh, with a pool

04:50.507 --> 04:51.900
and a vegetable garden.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.337
Hop in.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.773
We might even use the sirens.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.428
Oh, ye of little faith.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.696
Please put your hands
behind your back.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.089
What do you mean,
under arrest?

05:07.089 --> 05:08.438
I peed on the street.
What's so wrong with that?

05:08.438 --> 05:09.613
- Hi, good morning, officers.
- I had to pee.

05:09.613 --> 05:10.745
Where I was supposed to pee?
Dogs do that.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.312
The dogs pee on the trees.
- Hey, hi.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.356
Good morning, officers, hi.
- Why can't I pee on a tree?

05:13.356 --> 05:14.357
Hey, how you doing?
Hi, Carla.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.663
You seem upset.
Are you okay?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.926
Yeah, will you please tell
Starsky and Hutch

05:17.926 --> 05:19.623
to stop harassing
regular people

05:19.623 --> 05:20.885
who have done nothing wrong?

05:20.885 --> 05:22.539
Ma'am, public urination is
against the law.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.932
- Ooh, "public urination."
- Ah.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.326
It wasn't public
until you two started looking.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.457
You pervo.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.893
Hey, office--officers, hi.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.678
I'm--I'm Dr. Frome.
I work at New Amsterdam.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.157
Can I just take her
off your hands?

05:32.157 --> 05:34.029
What a guy!

05:34.029 --> 05:35.987
It's--it's like I'm,
what, an old couch

05:35.987 --> 05:37.424
from, uh, Craigslist?

05:37.424 --> 05:38.773
Ri--right, yeah.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.383
- Is she your patient?
- Um, no.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.777
No, not exactly.
Carla is a frequent flier.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.213
She's been through
the hospital a bunch

05:44.213 --> 05:45.867
with these kinds of issues.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.042
So I know her.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.696
Don't think
your treatment's working.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.655
She is an alcoholic
with serious mental illness.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.135
Uh, she can't even
control her bladder

05:53.135 --> 05:54.397
with what she's
put her body through.

05:54.397 --> 05:55.833
So taking her to jail,

05:55.833 --> 05:57.748
that's not gonna do anybody
any good, right?

05:57.748 --> 06:00.751
Create more paperwork
for you guys, so...

06:02.536 --> 06:04.320
- We can't just turn her loose.
- Sure.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.539
If you're taking responsibility,

06:05.539 --> 06:07.715
you'll have to admit her
to the hospital.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.239
Yeah, I'll do you one better.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.328
I'll take her to court.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.380
Lilo.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.339
Did we have an appointment?

06:23.339 --> 06:24.775
I know you're busy,

06:24.775 --> 06:27.561
but, uh,
it's about my transplant.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.214
Right.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.652
Lilo, look, I haven't
heard anything from UNOS.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.828
And I promise I'll call you

06:33.828 --> 06:35.743
the minute a lung
becomes available.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.614
And I know waiting
can be frustrating--

06:37.614 --> 06:40.225
Oh, it's not that.
I--I just need some medication.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.706
The nurse said I had to see you
before I can get 'em refilled.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.665
What medications?

06:49.104 --> 06:52.629
Azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.588
Lilo, these are all
immunosuppression drugs

06:54.588 --> 06:57.242
for someone who is already
post-transplant.

06:57.242 --> 07:00.115
I am post-transplant.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.073
- What?
- I--

07:02.073 --> 07:03.945
I got a new lung.

07:08.384 --> 07:09.516
How?

07:11.648 --> 07:13.389
I bought it.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.092
<i>Yeah, great natural light.</i>

07:21.092 --> 07:22.703
Yeah,
nothing says "fresh start"

07:22.703 --> 07:24.313
like floor-to-ceiling windows.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.880
Is that a private elevator?

07:25.880 --> 07:27.751
- Uh-huh.
- You really need all that?

07:27.751 --> 07:29.579
Yeah, of course I need it.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.059
It's turnkey.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.583
You've seen my place.
I'm helpless on my own.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.715
I can just move right in

07:34.715 --> 07:36.151
and not have to do
a damn thing.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.240
<i>Paramedics needed,
Midtown West.</i>

07:38.240 --> 07:41.504
<i>Chainsaw attack.
Injuries on scene.</i>

07:41.504 --> 07:42.766
Unit 223 responding.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.333
Oh, great.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.074
Now I'm gonna have
to pay all cash.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.032
Did they just say
"chainsaw attack"?

07:53.516 --> 07:55.257
Speech time.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.868
Um, thank you all for coming.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.000
Um...

08:00.523 --> 08:03.352
I don't know what to say.

08:03.352 --> 08:07.487
Five years ago, I was dying.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.489
My cancer treatment
wasn't working.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.621
I couldn't swallow
my own saliva.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.102
I couldn't stand
without support.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.625
I didn't know
if I was gonna live

08:15.625 --> 08:18.498
to see my own daughter be born.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.545
But then this place,

08:22.545 --> 08:26.070
New Amsterdam, saved me.

08:26.070 --> 08:30.945
And so it is a great honor
and perhaps a fitting legacy

08:30.945 --> 08:33.817
to announce today
that our partnership

08:33.817 --> 08:36.994
with Ithaca Pharmaceuticals
has won the battle

08:36.994 --> 08:38.866
against bulky
large-cell lymphoma.

08:38.866 --> 08:43.610
And we did not just
find a treatment.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.263
We found a cure.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.095
To curing cancer.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.577
Aw, you did it, Max.

08:57.493 --> 08:58.668
Hey.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.550
The clinical trial
that you just toasted?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.290
It's a sham, Max.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.611
- This is it.
- Uh, bring the EPK

09:28.611 --> 09:29.873
in case we need to tourniquet.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.745
- On it.
- Whoa, hang on.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.137
Chainsaw attack.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.444
I'm going in first.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.018
It sounded worse
on the radio.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.368
So dangerous.

09:46.368 --> 09:49.458
I am sorry.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.156
Go get me a suture kit.

09:52.156 --> 09:55.856
Hi.
Ooh, ow.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.032
Uh, yeah, okay.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.296
One of the kids bite you?

10:01.296 --> 10:03.428
Shouldn't have tried
to juggle four.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.821
Whatever happened
to bowling pins?

10:04.821 --> 10:06.867
One must rise
to the increasing demands

10:06.867 --> 10:07.911
of an ever hungry public.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.043
Hm.
They're ten.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.871
They'd be entertained
if you farted.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.830
Let's get him loaded up
and back to New Amsterdam.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.397
Does he really need
to go to the ED

10:15.397 --> 10:17.138
for a simple laceration?

10:17.138 --> 10:18.574
I mean, it's gonna take hours.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.489
I could just stitch him up
right here.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.709
That must be
an amazing apartment.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.015
- Laundry in unit.
- Um, excuse me.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.190
Hello?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.496
- Sorry, man.
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.932
If--if you could patch me up
right here,

10:28.932 --> 10:30.891
that'd be outstanding.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.197
I got a bar mitzvah on
the East Side in about an hour.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.895
See?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.723
Even the juggler doesn't
want to go to the hospital.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.638
Tell Carmona to keep
the engine running.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.379
Thank you.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.033
All right,
let's get you stitched up.

10:46.036 --> 10:50.040
- You're all right.
- Ah, I--I hate these places.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.869
Feels like I should've worn
a pantsuit or something.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.349
Yeah, I mean,
I get that you don't have

10:54.349 --> 10:56.525
any positive associations
with courtrooms, believe me.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.092
But, uh, this is
a little different.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.485
This is CARE court.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.878
Check it out.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.622
Yeah.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.189
Well, I thought that, uh,

11:08.189 --> 11:10.060
"People's Court"
was pushing it.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.758
All right, well, you know,
the--the basic idea

11:11.758 --> 11:13.368
is that this is designed
to keep you out

11:13.368 --> 11:15.936
of the criminal justice system,
not put you back in it.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.025
So people with long-standing
compounded issues

11:18.025 --> 11:20.767
like mental illness, addiction,
chronic homelessness,

11:20.767 --> 11:22.464
they get the care and
the treatment that they need.

11:22.464 --> 11:25.075
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.555
Hi.
Good morning, guys.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.513
Uh, this is Carla.
- Yeah, I don't--I don't know.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.993
I don't know, Doc.
You know, maybe I'll just

11:29.993 --> 11:31.081
be sneakier when I pee.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.343
Carla, hey, hey, I--I--

11:32.343 --> 11:33.475
I know that you hate
accepting help.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.998
I know that.
I know.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.435
And I can only imagine
how shaming and insulting it is

11:37.435 --> 11:38.785
for an obviously intelligent
human being

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
to have all these people insinuating

11:40.743 --> 11:43.485
that you can't
manage your own life.

11:43.485 --> 11:46.314
But what you're doing
is not working.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.663
It's not.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.146
I mean, don't you want
a shot at something more?

11:58.195 --> 11:59.631
This is Dr. Reynolds.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
<i>Dr. Reynolds,
this is Dr. Selemani.</i>

12:01.590 --> 12:02.983
Dr. Selemani, yes.

12:02.983 --> 12:06.682
Uh, Nurse Gabrielle Morris
is on my staff.

12:06.682 --> 12:10.033
Um, actually,
can I call you back?

12:10.033 --> 12:11.687
This isn't a great time.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.820
Yeah.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.647
Yes, uh,
seven hour time difference.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.649
I'll call you back ASAP. Thanks.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.610
Here are your labs,
Dr. Reynolds.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.612
Thank you, Nurse Gabrielle.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.619
What is it?

12:30.619 --> 12:32.490
Lilo's new lung,

12:32.490 --> 12:33.970
his body's rejecting it.

12:33.970 --> 12:34.971
<i>I don't get it.</i>

12:34.971 --> 12:36.016
They said
everything went great.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.017
Who said?

12:37.017 --> 12:38.235
The doctors.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.368
Okay, Lilo, listen to me.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.412
I'm gonna need
the medical records

12:41.412 --> 12:42.631
from your transplant, okay?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.198
I'm gonna need
the donor's blood type,

12:44.198 --> 12:45.677
HLA match, the age,

12:45.677 --> 12:47.549
medical history.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.638
I mean, hell, do you even
know who this person was?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.466
No, I have no idea.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.815
And I don't care.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.644
I was on your donor list
for two years.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.690
Two years of waiting
and struggling to breathe,

12:58.690 --> 13:00.649
two years of you telling me
to be patient.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.216
Well, that's how it works.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.348
I wasn't gonna sit around
twiddling my thumbs

13:04.348 --> 13:05.436
until I died.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.047
So I researched online.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.439
I drained my 401[k].

13:08.439 --> 13:09.701
I went to Honduras.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.357
Honduras?

13:13.357 --> 13:15.446
Well, don't look at me
like that.

13:15.446 --> 13:18.058
It was a real hospital,
real doctors.

13:18.058 --> 13:20.451
They found me a lung
right away.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.062
No waiting, just results.

13:22.062 --> 13:25.456
So I'm sorry if I don't exactly
know where it came from.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.763
But I was busy
trying not to die.

13:29.112 --> 13:32.899
Um, so your body's
rejecting that lung,

13:32.899 --> 13:34.248
and the only way
we're gonna keep you alive

13:34.248 --> 13:36.076
is if we take it out...

13:36.076 --> 13:37.512
today.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.518
Let's go, let's go!

13:43.518 --> 13:45.085
Come on, people.
Money never sleeps.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.260
You're a monster.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.783
Lincoln Center
to Battery Park?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.089
If we hurry,
we can still make it.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.526
<i>Lower East Side,
two car collision.</i>

13:51.526 --> 13:54.181
<i>People trapped in vehicles,
possible fatalities.</i>

13:54.181 --> 13:56.183
<i>All available units,
please respond.</i>

13:59.490 --> 14:01.014
There are two
other rigs nearby.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.016
If you want, we can say we're
still working things here.

14:03.016 --> 14:06.106
No, lights and sirens.
Let's roll!

14:06.106 --> 14:07.498
Unit 223 en route.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.897
It is right there
in the data breakdown.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.639
Yeah, which clearly shows
the efficacy is well above

14:17.639 --> 14:19.336
the combined
SEER stage survival rate

14:19.336 --> 14:21.382
for B-cell lymphoma.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.470
Yes, you were correct.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.080
The success rate is 89%.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.734
Astonishing.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.999
So?

14:29.999 --> 14:32.523
Look at the study's
participant breakdown.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.090
Okay.

14:35.526 --> 14:39.008
Uh, ages 25 to 65,

14:39.008 --> 14:42.882
89%...Caucasian.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.842
That is a non-diverse
participant pool.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.061
Those numbers do not reflect

14:48.061 --> 14:49.889
New Amsterdam's
patient population.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.934
It definitely does not reflect
the general population.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.023
If we do not test this
on a wider demographic,

14:54.023 --> 14:57.766
how can we prove
that it is safe and effective?

14:57.766 --> 15:00.856
The last thing that we want
is another tha--tha--

15:00.856 --> 15:02.858
sorry, sorry, what?

15:02.858 --> 15:04.816
Thalidomide--
- Thalidomide.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.601
It's a drug from the '60s
that they would give

15:06.601 --> 15:08.168
to pregnant women for nausea...
- Mm.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.344
And they didn't test it
on pregnant women.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.129
So they didn't know that
it would cause birth defects.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.481
If we do not test
Lymphodril properly,

15:17.481 --> 15:20.484
this miracle cure could
wind up being a death sentence

15:20.484 --> 15:25.011
for anyone who is not white
between the ages of 35 and 65.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.969
How could I have missed this?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.800
It was a blind trial.
We all missed it.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.021
Yeah, but this is everything
that I've fought against.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.979
This is Big Pharma
at its worst,

15:36.979 --> 15:39.242
and I just signed off on it.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.815
So what do we do?

15:49.818 --> 15:52.995
The only thing we can do.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.388
We can't release
this trial data

15:54.388 --> 15:56.085
for FDA approval.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.829
- But...
- That means...

16:00.829 --> 16:03.963
Yeah. We're gonna kill
the cure for cancer.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.926
What was he thinking?
It's insane.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.014
He didn't know.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.407
He didn't want to know.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.539
Buying an organ is illegal
for a reason.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.193
Now I have a patient
who's gonna suffer

16:17.193 --> 16:19.891
lifelong consequences because
of a stupid decision he made--

16:19.891 --> 16:21.415
assuming he survives.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.069
And you can bet the donor
didn't hand over the lung

16:23.069 --> 16:24.026
out of the goodness
of their heart.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.245
I've worked in countries

16:25.245 --> 16:27.116
where people are killed
for their organs.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.378
You wanna know
the worst part?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.032
Now I have to take
a perfectly good lung

16:30.032 --> 16:31.425
and throw it in the incinerator

16:31.425 --> 16:33.296
when there are people
who could benefit from it.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.776
But because
of how it was procured,

16:34.776 --> 16:35.820
nobody gets it.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.041
Unless...

16:39.041 --> 16:40.564
Unless what?

16:40.564 --> 16:43.306
What if there's a way
it doesn't go to waste?

16:48.094 --> 16:49.399
Good morning, Your Honor.

16:49.399 --> 16:53.012
I first met Carla, uh,
after a nice long bender.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.145
She suffered
acute alcohol poisoning.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.712
She was admitted
to New Amsterdam.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.367
She came to behavioral health
for a consult.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.500
And I diagnosed her with
post-traumatic stress disorder,

17:03.500 --> 17:06.851
offered her help by way
of therapy and medication.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.592
And Carla said no.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.941
Didn't you?

17:09.941 --> 17:12.596
Over the next decade,
Carla and I have replayed

17:12.596 --> 17:15.904
that first visit many,
many, many times,

17:15.904 --> 17:19.342
always with the same result,
haven't we?

17:19.342 --> 17:20.822
Yeah.
Now, I would

17:20.822 --> 17:22.171
try that hard for anyone.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.738
I would.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.306
But, uh, Carla is--

17:26.306 --> 17:28.395
um, she's kind

17:28.395 --> 17:32.268
and warm and very funny.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.792
And she's got a lot to give.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.360
We need her to stick around
so she can keep on giving it.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.449
I beseech the court
to enter Carla

17:39.449 --> 17:43.105
into the full CARE program
with mental health care,

17:43.105 --> 17:44.889
uh, rehab services,
and housing,

17:44.889 --> 17:46.543
the full meal deal.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.026
- Thank you, Dr. Frome.
- My pleasure.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.463
- Carla.
- Hm?

17:53.463 --> 17:55.204
Do you have anything to add?

17:55.204 --> 17:58.425
Um...

17:58.425 --> 18:02.646
yeah, I just--
one question out of curiosity.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.866
Who is that guy?

18:04.866 --> 18:07.390
Uh, I'm your
court-appointed advocate.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.090
Well, he's--he's advocating.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.875
He just--he made a big speech
and everything.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.791
So what are you advocating for
that he isn't?

18:16.791 --> 18:18.140
Your rights,

18:18.140 --> 18:19.489
because if you enter
the care program,

18:19.489 --> 18:21.274
you'll be giving all of 'em up.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.668
Tell me that isn't true.

18:24.668 --> 18:27.062
It's not as bad as it sounds.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.328
Is that true?

18:37.681 --> 18:38.943
Come on!

18:40.641 --> 18:41.555
Help. Help!

18:41.555 --> 18:42.991
They're still inside.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.949
I need a trauma bundle
and cervical collar!

18:44.949 --> 18:46.603
You take the passenger.
- Already on it.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.171
Are you with me, sir?

18:49.171 --> 18:51.130
Airbags didn't deploy.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.349
Collar.
- My son's hurt.

18:53.349 --> 18:54.263
Help my son.
- I'm o--I'm o--

18:54.263 --> 18:56.222
I'm okay, Dad.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.832
We're gonna help everyone.

19:00.051 --> 19:03.272
It's a chest laceration,
possible pneumothorax.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.491
He's lost a ton of blood.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.883
His pulse is weak
and thready.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.670
He's going
in and out of shock.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.324
Can you smell that?
- Yeah.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.064
The engine's gonna blow.
We--we gotta move.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.153
Passenger's coming out.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.719
Move, move!

19:15.719 --> 19:18.592
You're gonna be okay.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.289
- Ah.
- Oh, it's jammed.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.161
The seatbelt's jammed.
- Here.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.336
Okay.
Get the gurney.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.685
Go, go.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.167
What's your name, sir?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.777
Paul.
Paul.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.910
And what do you have
planned today, Paul?

19:32.910 --> 19:34.129
Soccer.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.827
Well, you might
be a little late,

19:36.827 --> 19:39.917
but we're gonna
get you there, okay?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.223
Okay.
All right.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.443
Casey, we gotta go!

19:44.835 --> 19:46.402
Come on.
You get the shoulders.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.752
Okay.
All right.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.232
Carmona, Whitaker,
you're with us, okay?

19:50.232 --> 19:51.668
The kid's in the second bus.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.758
On my count.
One, two, three.

19:56.151 --> 20:00.242
All right.
Come on.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.809
You got him?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.768
Okay.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.030
We gotta go.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.946
Hey, he's not gonna make it.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.471
You know that, right?
- Let's go!

20:15.475 --> 20:18.434
Max, this is Ithaca VP,
Eric Hillbach.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.957
Tell me what I'm hearing
isn't true.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.829
I wish I could, all right?
We don't like this either.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.700
You're actively withholding
your own trial data

20:23.700 --> 20:26.442
for a drug that has been proven
to literally cure cancer.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.792
- Karen--
- Don't "Karen" me.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.491
This was a huge breakthrough
that could change the world.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.623
And now what?
You're having second thoughts?

20:33.623 --> 20:35.625
Without that data,
we don't get FDA approval,

20:35.625 --> 20:37.148
and this drug will die
on the vine.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.237
Yeah, and it should,

20:38.237 --> 20:39.629
because your trial
was inequitable,

20:39.629 --> 20:41.675
and you know it.
- Nearly all of participants

20:41.675 --> 20:44.417
were white from the perfect
socioeconomic class

20:44.417 --> 20:46.201
to afford this drug,
should it come to market.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.550
And they all had cancer.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.248
They did, but if this
is the only demographic

20:49.248 --> 20:50.988
that we're testing,
then how are we gonna know

20:50.988 --> 20:53.469
that this drug is safe
and effective for everyone?

20:53.469 --> 20:55.166
Dr. Goodwin,
Lymphodril targets

20:55.166 --> 20:58.039
the specific genetic defect
in the cancer.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.475
So trial demos don't matter.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.998
Only people's genes matter.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.827
I think that what mattered
was getting fast results

21:03.827 --> 21:05.089
and saving money.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.569
Right, that's why
you did a blind trial

21:06.569 --> 21:08.528
with limited parameters
so you didn't have

21:08.528 --> 21:09.964
to go out and do
community outreach,

21:09.964 --> 21:11.922
and you didn't have
to earn people's trust.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.054
Max.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.577
This drug is a huge deal,

21:14.577 --> 21:17.232
and while it may not have been
tested on all of mankind,

21:17.232 --> 21:19.582
there is irrefutable proof
that it saves lives.

21:19.582 --> 21:20.844
Some lives.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.150
If we don't bring
this drug to market now,

21:22.150 --> 21:24.152
there are patients
who will actually die.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.675
You want to own that?
- No, I just want to own

21:25.675 --> 21:28.069
a trial that doesn't say
"whites only."

21:29.549 --> 21:30.854
This is madness.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.553
These were your parameters,
not ours.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.032
Uh, what do--
what do you mean?

21:35.032 --> 21:38.079
The participant field,
the expedited timetable,

21:38.079 --> 21:39.298
every parameter was set

21:39.298 --> 21:40.995
by the New Amsterdam
oncology department.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.301
What are you saying,
that somebody here

21:42.301 --> 21:43.824
made these decisions?

21:43.824 --> 21:45.913
From our department?
Who?

21:48.916 --> 21:51.353
Who is it, Max?

21:51.353 --> 21:52.615
Helen Sharpe.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.897
Can't you go any faster?

22:13.897 --> 22:15.159
Welcome to my world.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.335
Street's clogged.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.423
Yeah, well, we're bigger.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.338
Just push the other cars
out the way!

22:19.338 --> 22:20.208
VFIB.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.300
Okay.
Clear.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.388
Shocking.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.696
Still no pulse.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.045
Going again.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.047
Clear.
Shocking.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.222
I got nothing.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.485
Damn it.
Going again.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.095
Clear.
Shocking.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.011
Nah, still nothing.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.230
We're gonna have
to start chest compressions.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.101
Lauren--
- I don't have a bone saw,

22:44.101 --> 22:46.756
cautery or retractor
or anything.

22:46.756 --> 22:49.237
I--

22:49.237 --> 22:50.891
Give me your knife.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.109
What are you doing?

22:52.109 --> 22:53.937
I'm figuring it out.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.910
What the hell are you doing?

23:09.910 --> 23:12.216
I'm opening this guy up.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.915
And then what?

23:14.915 --> 23:17.700
Okay.
Okay.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.485
I'm gonna start his heart.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.964
With what?

23:22.618 --> 23:23.837
Hey, do me a favor.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.405
Can you, uh,
hold this retractor?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.844
Okay.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.628
- Got it.
- All right, all right.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.550
Hey, I know this rig can't fly,

23:41.550 --> 23:43.770
but if you don't get us
to the 'Dam quick,

23:43.770 --> 23:45.511
this guy is toast!

23:49.340 --> 23:51.038
Carla.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.735
No one wants to take away
your rights.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.215
Yeah?
Well, that's not

23:54.215 --> 23:56.304
what my advocate
over there said.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.871
You want to live a happier,
less stressful life

23:57.871 --> 24:00.264
with your PTSD and
your addictions under control.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.744
Right?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.050
Okay, great.
Well, the CARE court

24:03.050 --> 24:04.530
can help you achieve that goal.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.314
All you have to do
is stick to the program,

24:06.314 --> 24:07.533
and your rights are your own.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.404
Carla, if you go
into this program,

24:09.404 --> 24:11.885
what are the chances
that you will go off your meds

24:11.885 --> 24:13.713
or continue drinking?

24:13.713 --> 24:17.586
It's pretty close to 100%,
if I'm under oath.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.414
If that happens,
the CARE court can

24:19.414 --> 24:21.503
legally compel you
into a conservatorship.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.462
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.159
Yes, if she becomes
an impediment

24:25.159 --> 24:26.595
to her own treatment.
- We are way,

24:26.595 --> 24:27.509
way past that point.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.250
I just think it's only fair

24:29.250 --> 24:31.382
that Carla knows exactly
what she'd be signing up for.

24:31.382 --> 24:33.515
Yeah,
what am I signing up for, Iggy?

24:33.515 --> 24:36.300
Conservatorship means that
this court would be empowered

24:36.300 --> 24:37.780
to make every choice for you--

24:37.780 --> 24:40.304
who you see, where you stay,
when you take your pills.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.871
Is that what you want?
- If you comply,

24:41.871 --> 24:43.003
that is not going to happen.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.179
She just said she won't.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.180
- I'll help you.
- Let her answer.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.355
I'll help you.
I will help you.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.836
You'll have help.
You can do this.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.315
You can do it.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.406
No.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.323
So Your Honor,
it would be a violation

24:59.323 --> 25:01.804
of her rights to enroll her
into the CARE program

25:01.804 --> 25:03.240
against her wishes.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.378
Then take away her rights.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.597
Mandate her
into the program today,

25:11.597 --> 25:13.207
right now.
- Wait a minute, Doc.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.382
What are you doing?
- Your Honor,

25:14.382 --> 25:15.557
I intervene with people
who are about

25:15.557 --> 25:17.298
to die by their own hand
all the time.

25:17.298 --> 25:18.821
So now we're
equating her refusal

25:18.821 --> 25:19.996
of help with self-harm.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.041
Look at her medical record.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.390
Her liver is cirrhotic.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.261
Her kidneys are in failure
because of drinking

25:24.261 --> 25:26.568
she admitted
she has no control over.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.874
What--what--
what else would you call that?

25:27.874 --> 25:29.615
A drinking problem.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.966
For people like Carla,

25:32.966 --> 25:34.707
a drink might as well be a gun.

25:34.707 --> 25:35.838
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.100
There is zero evidence

25:37.100 --> 25:38.667
that Carla will die
with her next drink.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.975
How slow a death
is slow enough for you?

25:41.975 --> 25:43.411
One hour?

25:43.411 --> 25:44.586
A day?
A week?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.457
This woman is killing herself

25:46.457 --> 25:48.372
right in front of us,
and I am trying to save her.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.723
And I'm asking the court.
I am--

25:50.723 --> 25:53.595
I am imploring the court
to help me save her.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.641
Mandate her
into the program today

25:55.641 --> 25:57.425
against her will
if you have to.

25:57.425 --> 26:00.210
It is the only way
that we can save her.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.609
Okay, we're gonna
resect the lung.

26:08.915 --> 26:09.959
Gentle.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.138
Okay.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.532
All right.

26:17.532 --> 26:21.231
Well, I see
minimal inflammation.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.277
Now we're gonna
perfuse the organ.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.408
Is the box ready?

26:24.408 --> 26:25.845
- Ready.
- All right.

26:27.977 --> 26:30.850
Okay.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.330
Here we go.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.599
It's ventilating.
- Yeah.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.211
It'll be in
a near-physiological state

26:44.211 --> 26:45.821
in no time.

26:45.821 --> 26:48.302
Dr. Reynolds,
why go through all this?

26:48.302 --> 26:49.651
We can't transplant that lung

26:49.651 --> 26:51.479
into any of our other patients.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.350
That's why we're gonna
put it where it belongs--

26:53.350 --> 26:55.744
in the original donor.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.399
Talk to me.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.443
They're in a small town

26:59.443 --> 27:00.967
just outside of San Pedro Sula.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.185
All right,
how soon can we get 'em here?

27:02.185 --> 27:03.665
We can't.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.537
They won't travel.
They won't even talk with us.

27:13.588 --> 27:14.981
How could Helen do this?

27:14.981 --> 27:18.724
I mean, she knows that
trial diversity is an issue.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.944
Of all people,
she would've shut this down.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.599
Maybe under normal
circumstances, yes, yes.

27:24.599 --> 27:27.863
But when the trial started,

27:27.863 --> 27:29.125
things were different.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.866
Di--how?
Medical bias didn't

27:30.866 --> 27:32.389
start three years ago.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.742
You don't see it.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.352
See what?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.834
She did it to save your life.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.712
No, she, uh--no.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.758
I mean, my cancer was
totally different.

27:54.585 --> 27:58.067
But they both shared
similar genetic mutations.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.721
The research was new.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.157
It would not have
been a stretch

28:01.157 --> 28:04.465
to believe that Lymphodril
could have cured you too.

28:07.642 --> 28:12.168
She chose the fastest way
to make that happen

28:12.168 --> 28:15.041
because she loved you.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.699
Coming through,
coming through!

30:31.699 --> 30:33.092
Watch your back!
- We're not stopping,

30:33.092 --> 30:34.963
just passing through.
Gotta get to the OR.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.530
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

30:36.530 --> 30:38.706
I thought you were
apartment hunting!

30:39.881 --> 30:41.970
Come on.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.319
Come on, Paul.
Come on.

30:43.319 --> 30:44.538
Stay with me.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.409
Don't you quit on me.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.020
- Get cardiac bypass ready.
- Okay.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.499
We got it from here.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.866
You're a good guy, Iggy.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.216
You, uh, care

31:10.216 --> 31:13.915
and all that good, cozy stuff.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.396
Just give it a chance, Carla.

31:16.396 --> 31:17.745
Come on, please.

31:17.745 --> 31:21.227
I can't take that chance.

31:21.227 --> 31:25.057
Even I would bet against me.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.494
If you were any smarter,
you would too.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.673
See you around, right?

31:34.370 --> 31:35.719
Yeah.

31:43.727 --> 31:45.904
See you around.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.785
She's gonna die
in the streets.

31:57.785 --> 32:00.048
Probably.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.745
Land of the free, Iggy.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.617
Land of the free.

32:27.684 --> 32:28.990
Mr. Murillo, hi.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.513
My name is Dr. Floyd Reynolds,

32:30.513 --> 32:32.689
and this is
Nurse Gabrielle Morris.

32:32.689 --> 32:33.647
Do you speak English?

32:35.954 --> 32:39.566
Okay, um--

32:44.049 --> 32:45.354
Oh, no, no, no.

32:52.796 --> 32:53.972
Oh.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.155
Thank you
for meeting with us.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.678
Is this going
to be another lecture?

33:48.678 --> 33:51.855
Well, we are about to submit

33:51.855 --> 33:54.032
the, uh, data for FDA approval.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.903
And you're okay with that?

33:55.903 --> 33:57.600
Uh, no.
No, actually,

33:57.600 --> 33:59.515
neither of us are.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.300
That is why we are
immediately starting

34:01.300 --> 34:02.953
an expanded trial
of Lymphodril.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.477
On whose dime?

34:04.477 --> 34:06.479
Well, the trial
inequities were on us,

34:06.479 --> 34:08.698
but, uh,
Lymphodril is your drug.

34:08.698 --> 34:11.614
They're your profits,
so it's your dime.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.228
This is a list
of health organizations

34:16.228 --> 34:17.533
that serve populations
that were not

34:17.533 --> 34:18.839
included in the original trial.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.884
Howard University
College of Medicine,

34:20.884 --> 34:23.061
Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's
Health Board,

34:23.061 --> 34:25.280
uh, Mission Health Cooperative.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.760
They're all ready
to run trials

34:26.760 --> 34:28.196
on the demographics
that we missed,

34:28.196 --> 34:30.416
Native American,
African American,

34:30.416 --> 34:32.374
Asian, Latinx, Middle Eastern--

34:32.374 --> 34:34.333
Uh, this may come
as a surprise to you,

34:34.333 --> 34:36.944
but we bring drugs to market
to make money,

34:36.944 --> 34:38.076
not hemorrhage it.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.599
Why would we do this?

34:39.599 --> 34:43.255
You have to admit,
the world is a diverse place.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.909
If you want to be in business
in 20 years,

34:45.909 --> 34:47.433
you have to include everyone.

34:47.433 --> 34:50.436
Yeah, and if you don't,
we can just walk out the door.

34:50.436 --> 34:51.915
And then we'll bury
these trial results,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.526
and then nobody gets this drug.

34:56.268 --> 35:00.098
Or... we can do this right.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.630
Okay.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.025
Okay.

35:15.025 --> 35:18.594
Thank you.

35:21.293 --> 35:25.166
Oh, Paul came through.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.125
Don't be so thrilled.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.256
Of course I'm thrilled,

35:28.256 --> 35:31.216
but I lost
the stupid apartment.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.435
- Ah.
- So much for fresh starts.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.307
Ah, it's a big city, LB.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.744
Huh?
You'll find the right place.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.139
Like here.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.792
Uh, excuse me.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.316
Are--are you showing
this place?

35:44.316 --> 35:45.752
Yes, I am.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.016
Ah, never mind.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.017
If it's a turnkey
that you want,

35:50.017 --> 35:52.150
this definitely ain't it.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.543
Matter of fact, this is like
the opposite of a turnkey.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.764
This is like, uh,
black hole chic,

35:57.764 --> 36:00.506
a blank canvas
without the canvas.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.247
Eh, you gotta pick out
every fixture,

36:02.247 --> 36:04.684
every light bulb,
every wall socket...

36:06.381 --> 36:09.819
Paint coloring, floor covering,

36:09.819 --> 36:12.170
walls, ceilings.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.433
I love it.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.305
I love it.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.220
You mean your interior designer
is gonna love it.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.875
No. No, I--I--
I'm gonna do it all myself.

36:21.875 --> 36:25.444
Lauren, um, you lived in
your apartment for ten years,

36:25.444 --> 36:27.272
and you never even
hung a poster.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.577
Well, I just
turned the metal trim

36:28.577 --> 36:31.189
inside an ambulance
into a chest retractor.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.755
I can do this.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.670
I mean, I need to do it,

36:34.670 --> 36:35.802
'cause that's the only way
it's ever gonna feel

36:35.802 --> 36:37.195
like it's really mine,
you know?

36:37.195 --> 36:39.414
If--if I make every decision,

36:39.414 --> 36:41.938
if I do the work thoughtfully,

36:41.938 --> 36:46.334
meticulously, painstakingly.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.031
That's the way I wanna live.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.819
All right.
All right.

36:55.169 --> 36:58.216
I think she's gonna take it.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.696
You are crazy.

37:00.696 --> 37:04.222
Oh, my God,
I love it so much.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.703
I didn't know
you spoke Spanish.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.357
Yeah.
Yeah, I've done my fair share

37:09.357 --> 37:11.577
of traveling myself, you know?

37:11.577 --> 37:13.492
I even spent
the first six months

37:13.492 --> 37:14.754
of my residency in the DR.

37:14.754 --> 37:15.972
Mm.

37:15.972 --> 37:19.062
Well, it was pretty sexy.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.542
Oh.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.370
Well, would you like to go
to dinner with me tonight?

37:22.370 --> 37:24.111
I can order in Spanish.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.286
You know, I'd love to,

37:25.286 --> 37:28.463
but I--I need to make it
an early night.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.987
I leave for Tanzania tomorrow.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.293
Tomorrow?

37:32.293 --> 37:33.729
The recruiter,
he said that he had

37:33.729 --> 37:36.645
never heard a recommendation
like you gave me.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.082
He said that he had
to make up an emergency

37:39.082 --> 37:40.388
just to get you off the phone.

37:42.738 --> 37:45.915
Yeah, you said that you went
on and on so much,

37:45.915 --> 37:49.397
sounded like you were
in love with me.

37:53.096 --> 37:55.577
I think I am.

38:07.981 --> 38:10.331
Hi.
Martin?

38:10.331 --> 38:11.289
Hi.
How are you doing?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.551
I'm Iggy.
- Iggs--

38:12.551 --> 38:14.509
Oh, wow.
Nice to meet you.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.598
I--oh God,
I'm mucking this up already.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.208
Look at you.
I didn't think you were

38:18.208 --> 38:21.342
gonna be this, uh, attractive.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.039
Thank you.
Uh, are we gonna

38:23.039 --> 38:23.997
do this all night?

38:23.997 --> 38:25.259
Oh, fully, yes.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.608
We are definitely
doing this all night long.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.697
Because, uh, I didn't know
what you were into,

38:28.697 --> 38:30.569
I took a safe shot, and, uh...

38:32.092 --> 38:33.223
- Roller skating.
- Yeah,

38:33.223 --> 38:35.182
'cause who doesn't
love roller skating?

38:35.182 --> 38:36.401
- Sure.
- Hi.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.403
Um--uh, shoe size?

38:38.403 --> 38:40.100
You know my--

38:40.100 --> 38:41.754
What?

38:41.754 --> 38:44.496
It's 11.
My shoe size is 11.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.149
11, nice.

38:46.149 --> 38:49.544
Uh, one 11, and I am a 12.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.677
There you go, 11.
- Yep.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.069
Thank you very much.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.462
And, uh, that is for you.

38:54.462 --> 38:55.942
Keep the change.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.813
Uh, so what did you say
you do again, Martin?

38:57.813 --> 39:00.686
Iggs, stop.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.644
What?

39:02.644 --> 39:06.822
Look, what if we try this
and it doesn't work?

39:06.822 --> 39:09.477
I don't know
if I can handle that.

39:09.477 --> 39:12.828
I know the kids can't
handle it.

39:12.828 --> 39:18.181
We can't keep playing
make-believe.

39:18.181 --> 39:21.054
Yeah, I know. Um...

39:21.054 --> 39:23.752
I--I'm scared too.

39:23.752 --> 39:26.886
But you know, if--
if we both want a fresh start,

39:26.886 --> 39:29.454
like, really want
a fresh start,

39:29.454 --> 39:32.282
I don't know how else to do it.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.546
Do you?

39:41.683 --> 39:46.688
So... where are you from?

39:46.688 --> 39:48.516
I am from Wisconsin.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.126
Where are you from?

39:50.126 --> 39:52.607
I am from Massachusetts.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.479
You're from--
of course you are.

39:54.479 --> 39:55.828
What do you mean,
of course I am?

39:55.828 --> 39:57.090
"I'm from Massachusetts."

39:57.090 --> 40:00.354
No, I--I lost
my accent years ago.

40:00.354 --> 40:01.660
You lost your what?

40:01.660 --> 40:03.183
I lost my accent.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.490
I don't talk like that.

40:20.548 --> 40:21.941
Yeah.

41:37.886 --> 41:41.760
<i>♪ We're home, we're home,
we're home ♪</i>

41:41.760 --> 41:45.807
<i>♪ Oh, we've come home</i>

41:45.807 --> 41:48.810
<i>♪ We've come home</i>
