WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.178
( crowd cheering in distance )

00:10.211 --> 00:12.046
GIRL:
Poets.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.518
Geniuses.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.387
( crowd stomping
and clapping in unison )

00:19.420 --> 00:22.022
GIRL:
Revolutionaries.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.632
Lemonade Mouth has been called
all of these things.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.571
( heartbeat pounding )

00:45.213 --> 00:48.048
( heartbeat pounding faster )

00:56.757 --> 01:01.629
OLIVIA:
But the real story, the story
of how our band came to be,

01:04.298 --> 01:06.066
is a mystery to them all.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.372
I wonder if they'd believe it

01:14.642 --> 01:17.378
( crowd cheering )

01:17.411 --> 01:19.880
if I told them that it all
started...

01:19.913 --> 01:22.583
( soft pop music
playing on keyboard )

01:22.616 --> 01:24.785
OLIVIA:
* Ooh, yeah

01:24.818 --> 01:26.487
* Mm

01:26.520 --> 01:28.622
* Breakthrough

01:28.656 --> 01:30.724
OLIVIA:
...right here.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.660
WOMAN:
The rules in here are simple.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.395
No eating, no drinking,
no sleeping,

01:34.428 --> 01:36.397
no talking, no tapping,
no texting.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.600
You break a rule,
I add another day of detention.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.202
Are we clear?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.603
Great.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.606
OLIVIA:
Stella Yamada, lead guitar.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.342
Wen Gifford, keyboard.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.811
Mo Banjaree, bass.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.914
Charlie Delgado, drum god.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.884
And me, Olivia White,

01:56.917 --> 01:59.353
future front man
for Lemonade Mouth.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.689
One, two, three,
four, five.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.161
OLIVIA:
It was this ragtag
group of five

02:07.195 --> 02:09.430
that started it all.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.236
All right. I have decided,

02:15.269 --> 02:16.704
rather than let you

02:16.737 --> 02:19.373
twiddle your little thumbs
for the next hour,

02:19.407 --> 02:22.776
we are going to
put those thumbs to use.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.945
We're gonna clean up
around here.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.714
We're gonna unpack,

02:26.747 --> 02:29.583
and we're gonna turn
this storage room

02:29.617 --> 02:31.919
into a music room.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.923
I mean, we might as well
make the best of it, right?

02:35.956 --> 02:38.426
We've been banished
to the basement.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.328
( strums guitar )

02:40.361 --> 02:41.329
( sighs )

02:41.362 --> 02:42.563
( droning from above )

02:42.596 --> 02:44.932
Did you hear that?

02:44.965 --> 02:47.335
Ooh.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.670
You know what?

02:49.703 --> 02:53.874
If they spent a fraction
of what that new gymnasium cost

02:53.907 --> 02:55.676
to keep this music program
alive, I--

02:55.709 --> 02:57.611
( droning from above )

02:58.846 --> 03:01.482
Ooh.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.352
That is it. That is it.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.555
OLIVIA:
But if I'm gonna tell you
this right,

03:07.588 --> 03:09.723
I need to go back
to the beginning.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.992
The morning it all began.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.328
( playing riff )

03:22.336 --> 03:24.605
WOMAN:
Let's go, Stell.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.477
You don't wanna be late
for your first day, do you?

03:34.348 --> 03:36.384
( shredding )

03:38.686 --> 03:41.221
( bell rings )

03:47.628 --> 03:48.596
( scoffs )

03:48.629 --> 03:51.765
Look, I know this is hard.

03:51.799 --> 03:55.002
Transferring to a new school
a month into the year?

03:55.035 --> 03:57.371
Yeah. Yeah.
( scoffs )

04:02.075 --> 04:03.877
Why would that
be hard?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.546
Stella.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.016
Stella.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.017
But who cares, right?

04:10.050 --> 04:12.420
I care.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.622
Then you and Dad
might have thought to ask me

04:14.655 --> 04:17.425
before you moved our family
halfway across the country.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.427
( cell phone ringing )

04:19.459 --> 04:20.494
( sighs )

04:20.528 --> 04:22.396
Hold that thought.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.632
Hello?

04:24.665 --> 04:27.768
Yes,
Mr. Johnson.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.537
The bioplastic
certification documents,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.305
they should be
on your desk...

04:31.339 --> 04:32.906
Ho-ho, check out
the new girl.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.041
( kids laugh )

04:34.074 --> 04:36.009
GIRL:
Nice hair.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.549
Have fun.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.789
Hey, Dad, don't you think
it's a little weird

04:48.822 --> 04:50.724
that your girlfriend's still
in college?

04:50.758 --> 04:51.792
( chuckles )

04:51.825 --> 04:53.394
She's 28, Wen.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.463
She's just taking
a photography course.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.532
Look, Dad,

04:58.566 --> 05:00.934
when guys go through
midlife crisis, they--

05:00.968 --> 05:03.070
They buy a sports car,
right?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.972
What do you say?
We turn in the truck,

05:05.005 --> 05:07.475
get a sports car?
I would fully support that.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.943
( chuckles )

05:09.977 --> 05:12.746
Give Sydney a chance,
for me.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.083
Why is everything
about Sydney?

05:16.116 --> 05:18.452
"Sydney wants Chinese food."

05:18.486 --> 05:20.421
"Let's watch Sydney's
favorite show."

05:20.454 --> 05:21.855
"Can't pick you up
from piano practice,

05:21.889 --> 05:23.023
Sydney called."

05:23.056 --> 05:25.426
Hey, I apologized
for that.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.627
Yeah, I know.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.095
You know, whatever.
Let's just go.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.431
I'm gonna be late
for my history presentation.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.766
( upbeat theme playing )

05:42.776 --> 05:44.778
( clears throat )

05:44.812 --> 05:46.614
Sorry.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.382
Are you excited, Charles?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.119
Soccer tryouts are today.

05:52.152 --> 05:56.790
Oh. Right. Yeah,
I'm-- I'm thrilled.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.527
Oh, your mother--
We.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.129
--thought you might like
to have this with you today,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.532
for luck.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.634
MRS. DELGADO:
It was your brother's.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.471
Tommy scored the winning goal
at state finals with that ball.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.641
( sobbing )

06:16.510 --> 06:19.647
Mom, what are you crying for?
Tommy's just away at college.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.916
I... Oh.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.088
( upbeat theme playing )

06:36.730 --> 06:38.599
Whoa. Unh.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.502
Remember, Mohini,
you need to speak

06:41.535 --> 06:43.170
to your teachers
about extra credit.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.939
Get your GPA up
for the college applications.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.776
But that's a couple
of years away yet.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.978
It's never too soon to think
about your future, Monu.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.045
Understand?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.413
Yes, Baba.
Mm.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.517
Is that...?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.051
Is that lipstick
you're wearing?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.187
No, Baba.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.991
Because you're too young
for that sort of thing.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.794
Yes, Baba. I'm late.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.061
Bye, Baba.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.663
Monu--

07:09.697 --> 07:11.965
Don't forget,
extra credit.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.206
Please don't see me.
Please don't see me.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.874
Yeah, you know it.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.577
( bell rings )

07:25.045 --> 07:26.714
MR. GIFFORD:
Have fun.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.724
Uh. Way to go, Olivia.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.493
( sighs )

07:39.527 --> 07:41.995
( mellow theme playing )

07:58.178 --> 08:00.047
MAN ( over PA ):
And one last reminder

08:00.080 --> 08:01.782
to show some school
spirit this weekend...

08:01.815 --> 08:03.851
Hey. There you are.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.586
Hey, Scott.
You scared me.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.888
Well, I've been looking
all over for you.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.990
So the band and I,

08:10.023 --> 08:11.992
we're gonna ditch
this morning,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.260
head on over to Ray's

08:13.293 --> 08:14.862
and practice
for the Halloween Bash.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.597
Wanna come?

08:16.630 --> 08:19.132
Sure, I'd love--

08:19.166 --> 08:20.267
I can't.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.135
What?
Come on, Mo.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.771
We barely see each other
as it is.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.305
Well, maybe
this Saturday.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.675
I'll tell my dad that I've got
extra credit, or--

08:27.708 --> 08:31.144
No, you know I got Mudslide
Crush rehearsals all weekend,

08:31.178 --> 08:33.280
plus soccer practice.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.616
Come on.
Just this once?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.751
For me?

08:38.785 --> 08:40.788
Don't worry about Brenigan,
all right?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.188
He's with
the new girl.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.992
( military theme playing )

08:46.694 --> 08:48.629
Well, I think that Stella's
still working through

08:48.662 --> 08:50.631
some anger issues
about moving.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.900
Yes,
I can see that.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.903
But I'm afraid that shirt is...

08:55.936 --> 08:56.970
What?

08:57.004 --> 08:58.972
Is there
a dress code here?

08:59.006 --> 09:03.310
Well, ahem, no, but there
is an unwritten line,

09:03.343 --> 09:05.913
and that shirt crosses it.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.347
( chuckles )

09:07.380 --> 09:09.917
What about freedom
of expression?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.785
Do you have
that here?

09:11.819 --> 09:16.690
Stella, just...cover up
for the day, okay?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.633
Stella, is it?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.336
I run a tight ship here.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.072
I don't know how they did things
back in Rhode Island,

09:32.105 --> 09:38.245
but in my school,
students respect the rules.

09:38.278 --> 09:43.050
Written...and unwritten.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.260
Come on, come on.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.964
( sighs )

09:56.997 --> 09:58.766
Please don't call my dad.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.367
He doesn't even
want me alone with a boy.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.369
If he found out
I skipped class with one,

10:02.402 --> 10:04.872
he'd never let me out
of the house.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.876
This is
your first infraction.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.145
You are
on the honor roll.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.783
I won't call
your father.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.284
Thank you.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.720
This time.

10:19.753 --> 10:23.123
But if I ever catch you
skipping class again...

10:23.156 --> 10:24.892
You won't, I promise.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.898
That's why the American
Revolution was so important.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.734
Thank you, Sharon.
Very nice.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.802
All right.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.372
Wendell, you're up.

10:43.911 --> 10:44.878
( sighs )

10:44.912 --> 10:48.315
( tense theme playing )

10:52.720 --> 10:54.154
( whispers ):
What?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.923
We're waiting.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.292
( in normal voice ):
One second, sir.
I'm sorry.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.061
I'm sorry. Um...

11:03.797 --> 11:06.366
This can't be happening.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.304
SYDNEY:
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.107
Wen, I have your folder.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.308
( boy 1 wolf-whistles )

11:15.342 --> 11:16.476
BOY 1:
Check out Wen's mommy.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.911
( boy 2 wolf-whistles )

11:17.945 --> 11:19.379
You must be
Wendell's mother.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.915
No, I'm--
She's not my mom, okay?

11:21.949 --> 11:25.252
Are you kidding me? Look at her.
All right, are you stupid?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.120
Oh.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.328
So...?

11:35.362 --> 11:39.199
Detention.
Ah. Ouch.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.235
But at least
we'll be together, right?

11:43.971 --> 11:45.338
Right?

11:45.372 --> 11:49.076
No, he actually let me off
with a warning.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.844
A warning?
Yeah.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.880
Yeah. You know,
I got soccer practice,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.514
some big games coming up.

11:54.547 --> 11:59.086
I just can't miss them.
But I'll see you at lunch, okay?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.087
Yeah, sure.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.721
All right.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.858
Unbelievable.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.830
What can I tell you,
Jenny?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.232
That you put the same value
on the arts

12:12.265 --> 12:13.967
as you do sports.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.169
You've cut the music budget
to zero.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.039
You've moved my classroom
down to the basement.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.008
And for what? Some gymnasium?

12:21.041 --> 12:24.111
BRENIGAN:
Whoa. This is
not "some gymnasium."

12:24.144 --> 12:27.114
Sports bring donors,
donors bring money,

12:27.147 --> 12:31.051
and money makes my school run.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.185
Your school?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.292
Times are tough, Jenny.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.394
Someone's gotta make the hard
decisions around here,

12:41.428 --> 12:44.164
and that someone is moi.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.367
( sputtering )

12:49.102 --> 12:54.007
"I'm Nobody. Who are you?
Are you nobody too?"

12:54.041 --> 12:56.309
Heh. Well, that would be a yes.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.313

COACH:
Here we go, hustle up.
Move it, move it.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.339
Come on, let's make a move.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.440
Unh.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.910
Ray, cut it out, dude.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.444
COACH:
Keep it going. Keep it going.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.580
Delgado, come on,
get with the program.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.382
I'll see you later.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.150
COACH:
Come on, what are y'all doing?

13:40.087 --> 13:42.189
RAY: Ha-ha-ha!
COACH: Let's go, Delgado.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.957
All right, guys, set up
for drill number two.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.958
Hustle up.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.927
Coach.
Come on, kids.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.395
Drill number two.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.097
RAY:
Drill two, kids, come on.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.235
Are you sure
that's Tommy Delgado's brother?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.603
Yeah.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.139
No, no, Delgado,
you gotta kick the ball.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.640
Like...that.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.509
( winces )

14:02.542 --> 14:04.544
That's it. You know what?
I don't wanna play soccer,

14:04.577 --> 14:06.346
I don't want your abuse,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.148
and I certainly don't want
my brother's ball.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.549
( grunts )

14:09.582 --> 14:14.554
Ooh. Yeah, I think he did that
on purpose, coach.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.588
( growls )

14:18.458 --> 14:22.162
( rock music playing )

14:22.195 --> 14:23.863
ANNOUNCER:
TurboBlast.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.299

14:28.535 --> 14:30.170

14:30.203 --> 14:32.305
ANNOUNCER:
TurboBlast.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.141
( crowd applauding
and cheering )

14:38.345 --> 14:41.915
Welcome to our first assembly
in our new gym,

14:41.949 --> 14:45.552
generously funded by
our school sponsor, TurboBlast.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.121
Drink of champions.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.656
Yeah. Whoo!

14:49.689 --> 14:52.192
You the man,
Brenigan.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.297
Right there, that.
That's good, Phil. Thanks.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.203
Our assembly today is about--

15:03.236 --> 15:06.206
Are you ready?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.274
--personal empowerment.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
Hi.
Hi.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.945
BRENIGAN:
That's right. Dig deep inside,
find the power within...

15:11.979 --> 15:14.414
Why don't you, uh,
find another seat?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.582
( laughs )

15:15.615 --> 15:18.018
Why don't you make me?
Ooh.

15:18.051 --> 15:22.289
BRENIGAN:
--excel not only on the field,
they excel in life.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.624
All right, move it.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.294
Come on.
What a freak.

15:27.327 --> 15:31.731
A student
who's willing to take risks.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.167
An empowered student.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.337
And by empowerment,
I mean

15:37.370 --> 15:40.073
going above and beyond
what's expected of you.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.042
You want empowered students?

15:42.075 --> 15:45.445
Now, I know it's all within you,
and you know it is as well.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.214
Then you're gonna get them.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.217
BRENIGAN:
On behalf of TurboBlast,
all our coaches--

15:50.250 --> 15:52.719
My shirt, my decision.

15:52.752 --> 15:56.123
Okay? Don't let your school
take away your rights. Okay?

15:56.156 --> 15:58.725
Be heard. Use your voice.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.261
( crowd cheering )

16:01.294 --> 16:02.695
Come on.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.331
He can't tell you
what to wear, who to be.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.598
Let's go.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.367
STELLA:
You can wear what you want.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.603
We can wear whatever we want.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.739
Whoo!
STELLA: Come on.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.141
Sit down.

16:14.174 --> 16:17.077
I can wear
my own T-shirt.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.680
Wear whatever kind of shirt
you want. Today, tomorrow.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.616
Okay. Ready? Okay.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.785
( bell rings )

16:25.818 --> 16:29.122
( in unison ):
Defense! Push 'em back!
Defense! Push 'em back!

16:29.156 --> 16:32.759
Defense! Push 'em back!
Way back!

16:32.792 --> 16:35.395
Defense! Push 'em back!

16:39.799 --> 16:43.136
( dance music playing )

16:45.405 --> 16:47.507
You lost?
Oh, no, I'm just looking--

16:47.540 --> 16:50.210
Detention, huh?
Follow me.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.645
What is this place?

16:52.679 --> 16:56.116
This is the underground.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.386
Robotics club. Hey, Alex.
You working hard?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.421
Shakespeare society.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.358
Chess club.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.661
He hasn't found a partner
in months.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.262
Ballet.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.031
WOMAN:
And one, and two...

17:13.366 --> 17:15.667
Mathletes.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.304
Art club.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.738
MAN ( on stereo ) :
* Looking good, honey

17:18.771 --> 17:20.540
* Play that, DJ
What you say? *

17:20.573 --> 17:24.411
Even the school newspaper.
Victoria, you doing good?

17:24.444 --> 17:27.446
Anything that doesn't fit
Principal Brenigan's mold,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.449
you'll find it down here.
( microphone squeaks )

17:29.482 --> 17:31.151
Oh. This is my stop, AV club.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.419
You're telling me Brenigan

17:32.452 --> 17:34.687
just stuck your clubs
in the basement?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.689
Pretty much. Unless
you're wearing a varsity jacket

17:36.723 --> 17:38.825
or a cheer skirt, around here
you're basically--

17:38.858 --> 17:40.227
Invisible.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.728
See? You're catching
on already.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.164
Detention's at the end
of the hall.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.498
Good luck.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.468
No, guys. You keep doing
this wrong.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.377
( upbeat theme playing )

18:00.780 --> 18:02.482
OLIVIA:
There is a moment

18:08.521 --> 18:11.090
where the stars align

18:14.427 --> 18:17.096
and fates collide,

18:19.832 --> 18:22.269
creating that perfect union.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.138
( groans )

18:25.172 --> 18:27.106
Mm. Hmm.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.112
OLIVIA:
This was that moment.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.685
I am gonna give Brenigan
a piece of my mind,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.420
and while I do, I want you guys

18:40.453 --> 18:43.390
to just start cleaning up
or something around here.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.658
She can't make us clean.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.761
It's cruel and unusual
punishment.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.863
Welcome to
high school.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.236
This school stinks.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.637
Can you guys just do

18:57.670 --> 18:59.406
what Miss Reznick
asked and be quiet? Okay?

18:59.439 --> 19:02.809
I'm not getting another
detention because of you people.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.552
( water dripping )

19:15.988 --> 19:18.691
( fingers drumming )

19:18.725 --> 19:19.959
( snap )

19:19.992 --> 19:23.430
( fingers drumming
and snapping )

19:25.832 --> 19:26.933
( spray bottle puffing )

19:26.966 --> 19:28.601
( keys jingling )

19:28.635 --> 19:29.836
( spray bottle puffing )

19:45.585 --> 19:47.987
( playing upbeat pop music )

19:48.020 --> 19:51.358
( upbeat pop music
playing on xylophone )

20:01.768 --> 20:06.973
* Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na *

20:07.006 --> 20:09.309
* Take a look around

20:09.342 --> 20:11.878
* Who would have thought
We'd all be here? *

20:11.911 --> 20:14.847
* So let's mess around

20:14.881 --> 20:16.983
* 'Cause the future
Is unclear *

20:17.016 --> 20:19.719
* We got nothing better to do

20:19.752 --> 20:22.655
* We're just trying
To get through *

20:22.689 --> 20:25.258
* Can you hear me?
STELLA: Ha, ha.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.328
* Can you hear me? Yeah

20:28.361 --> 20:30.763
* Let the music groove you

20:30.797 --> 20:33.366
* Let the melody move you

20:33.400 --> 20:36.002
* Feel the beat
And just let go *

20:36.035 --> 20:38.738
* Get the rhythm
Into your soul *

20:38.771 --> 20:41.007
* Let the music take you

20:41.040 --> 20:43.876
* Anywhere it wants to

20:43.910 --> 20:46.346
* When we're stuck
And can't get free *

20:46.379 --> 20:49.382
* No matter what
We'll still be singing *

20:49.416 --> 20:51.818
* Come on, come on
Turn up the music *

20:51.851 --> 20:54.621
* It's all we got
We're gonna use it *

20:54.654 --> 20:57.557
* Come on, come on
Turn up the music *

20:57.590 --> 20:58.958
* Yeah

20:58.991 --> 21:01.661
* All we have is now

21:01.694 --> 21:04.063
OLIVIA & MO:
* Let's make the most of this

21:04.096 --> 21:06.699
* Come on, break it out

21:06.733 --> 21:09.436
OLIVIA & STELLA:
* So everyone can hear it

21:09.469 --> 21:12.038
* They don't have
To understand *

21:12.071 --> 21:14.641
* But we'll make them
If we can *

21:14.674 --> 21:17.043
* Do you hear me?

21:17.076 --> 21:20.513
OLIVIA & MO:
* Are you with me? Yeah

21:20.547 --> 21:22.982
ALL:
* Let the music groove you

21:23.015 --> 21:25.652
* Let the melody move you

21:25.685 --> 21:28.321
* Feel the beat
And just let go *

21:28.355 --> 21:30.923
* Get the rhythm
Into your soul *

21:30.957 --> 21:33.526
* Let the music take you

21:33.560 --> 21:36.062
* Anywhere it wants to

21:36.095 --> 21:37.664
* When we're stuck
And can't get free *

21:37.697 --> 21:39.532
Aah!

21:39.566 --> 21:41.801
* No matter what
We'll still be singing *

21:41.834 --> 21:43.836
* Come on, come on
Turn up the music *

21:43.870 --> 21:46.806
* It's all we got
We're gonna use it *

21:46.839 --> 21:49.075
* Feel the beat
And just let go *

21:49.108 --> 21:51.944
* Get the rhythm
Into your soul *

21:51.978 --> 21:54.447
* Let the music take you

21:54.481 --> 21:57.083
* Anywhere it wants to

21:57.116 --> 22:00.553
* Come on, come on
Turn up the music *

22:00.587 --> 22:02.589
* Yeah

22:02.622 --> 22:04.857
STELLA: That was so cool.
CHARLIE: That was awesome.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.026
Oh, I'm really sorry.
We just started to...

22:07.059 --> 22:08.461
( Segway droning from above )

22:08.495 --> 22:09.729
WEN: We were just...
Shh. Shh.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.030
WEN: We weren't...
CHARLIE: I...

22:11.063 --> 22:12.432
WEN & CHARLIE:
Uh--

22:12.465 --> 22:14.501
Shh! Let me think.
I need to think.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.835
- You.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.137
Yeah,
I'm just gonna sit down.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.706
Olivia.

22:19.739 --> 22:23.976
Olivia, you have
a beautiful voice.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.845
Aah! Ha, ha!

22:25.878 --> 22:28.881
Your band, it's a gift.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.049
We're not a band.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.718
We don't even
know each other.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.020
You were meant to play together.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.789
It's-- It's destiny.
Oh, come on.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.459
You don't have a moment like
that and just ignore it.

22:39.492 --> 22:43.062
People, they--
They need to hear you.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.131
Shoot. That'll show Brenigan.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.366
( laughs )

22:48.435 --> 22:50.870
That will show Brenigan.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.872
( shrieking )

22:52.905 --> 22:57.410
That's it. Rising Star.
Rising Star.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.478
Rising what?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.146
Rising Star.

23:00.179 --> 23:03.015
It's a talent competition.
Winner gets a record deal.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.684
And some serious
air time.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.420
* Making tomorrow's stars
Today *

23:07.454 --> 23:08.621
( beatboxing )

23:08.655 --> 23:10.189
* Making to--
Making to-- *

23:10.222 --> 23:11.824
( beatboxing )

23:11.858 --> 23:13.025
Just think, you guys.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.695
You can show everyone
around here

23:15.728 --> 23:18.498
that sports isn't
the only thing that matters.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.768
So. Hee-hee.
What do you think?

23:21.801 --> 23:22.969
( drumming )

23:23.002 --> 23:25.037
You in?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.173
Pass.
What?

23:27.206 --> 23:29.075
It's ridiculous.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.043
REZNICK:
Okay.

23:31.077 --> 23:35.047
I really can't. Between my AP
classes and violin lessons...

23:35.081 --> 23:37.950
Yeah, I've--
I've got stuff.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.619
Stuff.

23:41.721 --> 23:45.692
Okay, well then,
what about you, Olivia?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.895
I don't sing.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.964
Uh, we just heard you sing.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.666
Well, yeah, but that wasn't
real, like--

23:53.700 --> 23:56.603
Like on a stage.
I can't do that.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.805
Oh, come on. Sure you can.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.940
No, no, trust me,
it wouldn't be pretty.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.208
The last time I performed
on-stage

24:02.241 --> 24:03.643
was my first-grade recital.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.144
Five minutes into
"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep"

24:05.177 --> 24:06.679
I threw up down
Mikey Nichols' back.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.114
Ha, ha.
Yeah, I remember that.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.716
That was hilarious.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.484
No, it was humiliating.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.886
I'm sorry, I can't.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.957
Well, I-- I guess
that counts me out, right?

24:17.990 --> 24:20.960
Can't really enter a competition
with one man in a band.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.730
You know, unless you're thinking
of a solo career.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.097
Which I'd be happy to consider.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.734
Guys, Mudslide Crush
are entering.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.636
We wouldn't have
a shot.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.237
He's right.
They're amazing.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.105
They're not
that amazing.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.108
Well, if we don't stand a chance
against these Mudslide guys,

24:36.142 --> 24:39.278
then why bother, right?

24:39.311 --> 24:42.582
Because,
you said it yourself,

24:42.615 --> 24:45.718
you deserve to be heard.

24:45.752 --> 24:49.622
( upbeat rock theme playing )

25:10.042 --> 25:11.644
Gram?

25:13.045 --> 25:15.014
Gram.

25:15.047 --> 25:18.017
Hey. Oh, Olivia, sweetie.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.286
Hey.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.021
Oh, how's Nancy doing?

25:22.054 --> 25:24.624
Oh, she still
hasn't eaten.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.693
Nance. Come here.
( Nancy meows )

25:26.726 --> 25:28.895
You need to eat.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.697
You need to eat,
old girl.

25:30.730 --> 25:34.667
Come on, girl.
Come on. Look. Yum.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.237
Hey there, buddy.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.239
We're going out for a ride.
Wanna come?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.075
No, I don't like to ride.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.945
Yes, you do.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.246
No, I don't.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.948
MR. GIFFORD:
Come on, Wen.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.883
Since when don't you like
to ride your horse?

25:59.992 --> 26:03.095
Come on, ladies.
We are going for a ride.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.831
( Mr. Gifford grunts
and Sydney chuckles )

26:04.864 --> 26:07.033
( playing classical music )

26:22.381 --> 26:26.218
( playing upbeat pop music )

26:26.252 --> 26:29.756
( Charlie drumming )

26:32.925 --> 26:34.661
Charlie.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.901
So?

26:43.870 --> 26:45.004
How were soccer tryouts?

26:46.338 --> 26:47.974
Well, um,

26:48.007 --> 26:49.742
they were...

26:50.743 --> 26:51.744
Great.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.045
Oh.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.981
It went-- It went great.
I knew it. I knew it.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.983
Mwah.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.251
Why don't you come in now
and hit the books?

26:59.285 --> 27:01.988
You're never gonna make it
to Stanford with your brother

27:02.021 --> 27:05.257
whacking away at these drums
every day, are you?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.860
Come on. Start with
your math.

27:07.894 --> 27:11.731
( elegant classical music
playing )

27:11.764 --> 27:13.766
STELLA:
Yuck, Dad.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.868
How can you
eat that?

27:15.902 --> 27:18.337
Imagine how
that poor fish felt.

27:18.370 --> 27:22.074
Fish don't
feel pain.

27:22.108 --> 27:25.177
Just because you don't see agony
doesn't mean it's not there.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.914
When did you become
a vegetarian?

27:27.947 --> 27:31.650
Yeah, when did this happen?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.058
Four months ago.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.828
Wow, for a bunch
of geniuses,

27:41.861 --> 27:43.429
you people don't pay
very good attention.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.164
Because it's stupid,
Stella.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.198
Timmy.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.838
Sorry I'm not out inventing
biodegradable plastic,

27:51.871 --> 27:57.176
or making my own toys, or,
oh, yeah, curing cancer.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.312
We haven't cured it yet, honey.

28:00.346 --> 28:04.183
Hello. I know that.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.418
I may not be a genius--
Which is, like,

28:06.452 --> 28:09.188
I don't know, a genetic
abnormality in this family.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.958
But I can do things too,
you know.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.197
( sighs )

28:18.230 --> 28:21.801
I could start a revolution.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.937
MR. YAMADA:
That's nice, dear.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.873
Good morning, Mesa High.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.875
Yes, it's that time of year
again.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.943
You have to get out there and
vote, because guess what.

28:30.977 --> 28:33.145
Yes, I have been nominated,
yet again,

28:33.179 --> 28:34.847
for School Administrator
of the Year.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.348
Let's keep that winning streak
alive.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.084
( cell phone beeping )

28:38.117 --> 28:39.418
( Brenigan laughing on monitor )

28:39.451 --> 28:41.954
BRENIGAN:
Okay.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.355
Vote today,
the polls are open all day.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.424
There's extra credit involved.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.793
( cell phone beeping )

28:54.300 --> 28:55.734
( cell phone beeping )

29:00.873 --> 29:02.875
You think it's about the band?
Oh, my.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.987
( Stella sighs )

29:15.021 --> 29:16.555
We talked about this.
It's not gonna happen.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.258
Sure it is.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.427
I signed us up for Rising Star
this morning.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.395
MAN:
Check. Check, one, two, check.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.297
We're not
experienced enough.

29:25.331 --> 29:29.001
Which is why I also signed us up
for Halloween Bash.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.269
( Mo chokes )

29:30.302 --> 29:31.804
MAN:
Check, check, one, two, check.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.874
What? Wait,
how'd you pull that off?

29:34.907 --> 29:37.076
It's amazing
what a principal will agree to

29:37.109 --> 29:39.411
if he thinks
his new "problem student"

29:39.445 --> 29:41.914
is channeling her energy
into something productive.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.415
WEN: Hmm.
Stella.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.551
Goofing around in detention
does not make us a band.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.020
So we'll practice.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.156
You have real drums, right?

29:50.189 --> 29:52.291
Yeah.
STELLA: See?

29:52.324 --> 29:54.060
( whispers ):
I didn't even know that.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.227
Ha, ha.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.963
Okay, so,
what are we gonna play?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.898
You could write our songs.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.332
Me?
Yeah.

30:00.366 --> 30:03.903
That one you did the other day
was pretty amazing.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.205
MO: Mm-hm.
That was nothing.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.175
I think I'm gonna be sick.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.378
Wait. We can't play the Bash.
Mudslide Crush is playing.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.481
( in normal voice ):
And we are opening for them.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.353
I don't know about
the rest of you guys,

30:21.387 --> 30:25.457
but I don't wanna be some
random face in a yearbook.

30:25.491 --> 30:29.195
Or a kid people vaguely recall
passing in the halls.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.230
I wanna be heard.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.203
( mouths ) Hi.
JULES & PATTY: Ha, ha.

30:37.236 --> 30:41.941
STELLA:
Wen and I are in. Who's with us?

30:41.974 --> 30:43.542
I'll give it a shot.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.411
Really?
Yeah?

30:45.444 --> 30:48.280
But only
if everyone else agrees.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.350
Just one practice. If it works,
great. If not, I'm out.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.385
All right.
Okay. Ha, ha.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.355
WEN:
Hey.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.623
Mm-mm.

30:57.656 --> 31:01.360
Come on. Say you'll try.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.129
Please.
It'll be fun.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.363
It'll be so much fun.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.065
STELLA:
Pretty please, sugar on top?

31:06.098 --> 31:07.233
WEN:
You will have so much fun.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.535
D'oh. Okay, okay. I'll do it.

31:09.568 --> 31:13.272
Yes. Yes.
It'll be great.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.246
You know what?

31:20.279 --> 31:21.880
Heads, we do it.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.450
Tails, we don't.

31:24.483 --> 31:28.254
( tense theme playing )

31:28.287 --> 31:31.290
OLIVIA:
One of the misconceptions
about Lemonade Mouth

31:31.323 --> 31:33.259
is that we were a natural fit
from the start.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.393
( coin clinks )

31:34.426 --> 31:36.262
OLIVIA:
Totally not true.

31:36.295 --> 31:39.331
Come on, Charlie.
It's a simple four-four beat.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.133
You're not even trying.

31:41.167 --> 31:47.139
It's B to B-flat, back to B,
then an F-sharp. Ready?

31:47.173 --> 31:51.043
( all playing rock song
out of synch )

31:56.048 --> 31:58.150
Okay, this isn't working.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.320
We'll get it.
We just need to keep practicing.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.956
Also, maybe we need to go
a little more hardcore.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.624
( Mo scoffing )

32:05.657 --> 32:08.094
That's it. I'm out of here.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.329
What?
You're just gonna stomp away?

32:10.362 --> 32:12.031
Yeah, come on. Don't leave.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.499
In case you guys
hadn't realized,

32:13.532 --> 32:15.167
I'm classically trained.

32:15.201 --> 32:18.070
On the violin.
I don't play whatever this is.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.341
I'm-- I'm out too.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.310
What?
Guys, look.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.178
Come on. We can work this out.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.613
Yeah.
Yeah, Wen's right.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.116
Maybe if we just take it
from the top one more time?

32:30.149 --> 32:32.251
STELLA:
They're quitting before
we've even started.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.055
They're quitters!
Shut up, Stella.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.456
Wait, Mo.
STELLA: Mo.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.191
OLIVIA:
Please, don't. Wait.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.528
( playing soft pop music
on keyboard )

32:50.236 --> 32:52.004
* Can you see me?

32:53.139 --> 32:54.706
* 'Cause I'm right here

32:56.375 --> 32:58.744
* Can you listen?

32:58.777 --> 33:01.613
* 'Cause I've been trying
To make you notice *

33:01.647 --> 33:04.350
* What it would mean to me

33:04.383 --> 33:07.619
* To feel like somebody

33:07.653 --> 33:10.656
* We've been on our way
To nowhere *

33:10.689 --> 33:13.492
* Tryin' so hard to get there

33:13.525 --> 33:18.530
* And I say
Oh, we're gonna let it show *

33:18.564 --> 33:22.668
* We're gonna just
Let go of everything *

33:22.701 --> 33:25.537
* Holding back our dreams

33:25.571 --> 33:29.141
* And try to make it
Come alive *

33:30.542 --> 33:34.380
* Come on, let it shine
So they can see *

33:34.413 --> 33:37.516
* We were meant to be

33:37.549 --> 33:40.186
* Somebody
Somebody *

33:40.219 --> 33:42.654
* Somebody, yeah
* Somebody

33:42.688 --> 33:47.526
* Somehow, someday, some way

33:47.559 --> 33:50.262
Boy, go to class.
OLIVIA: * Somebody

33:50.296 --> 33:51.797
* Get out of this darkness

33:51.830 --> 33:57.669
* Feel the spotlight glowing
Like a yellow sun *

33:57.703 --> 34:00.839
* Oh-ooh-oh, oh oh
STELLA: * Oh-ooh-oh, oh oh

34:00.872 --> 34:03.542
* And when we fall
We fall together *

34:03.575 --> 34:09.748
* Till we get back up
And we will rise as one *

34:09.781 --> 34:11.283
OLIVIA:
* Oh, oh

34:11.317 --> 34:13.552
( crowd cheering )

34:13.585 --> 34:15.853
OLIVIA, STELLA & MO:
* Oh, oh, oh
We're gonna let it show *

34:15.887 --> 34:17.755
* Let it show

34:17.789 --> 34:20.826
* We're gonna just
Let go of everything *

34:20.859 --> 34:23.695
* Holding back our dreams

34:23.728 --> 34:25.563
* And try

34:25.597 --> 34:27.233
* To make it come alive

34:27.266 --> 34:28.600
* Make it come alive

34:28.634 --> 34:32.771
* Come on, let it shine so they
can see *

34:32.804 --> 34:35.574
* We were meant to be

34:35.607 --> 34:37.609
* Somebody

34:37.643 --> 34:40.579
* Somebody
Somebody, yeah *

34:40.612 --> 34:41.713
* Somebody

34:41.746 --> 34:45.351
* Somehow, someday, some way

34:46.485 --> 34:48.554
* Somebody

34:51.623 --> 34:53.659
Olivia,
did you really write that?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.527
Yeah. Ha, ha.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.264
You guys,

34:58.297 --> 35:00.132
we are so winning a record deal.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.333
( chuckles )

35:01.367 --> 35:03.669
( Stella & Olivia laugh )

35:03.702 --> 35:06.705
( man rapping indistinctly
on speaker )

35:08.640 --> 35:12.278
So Brenigan took away half my
set for the Halloween Bash.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.346
PATTY:
What?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.748
RAY:
Yeah, I know. The guy's insane.
I mean, what is he gonna do?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.917
I mean, I'm the man, all right?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.786
( Scott chuckles )

35:20.819 --> 35:24.490
Hey, what's up? I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.892
So how'd you get
out of the house?

35:26.925 --> 35:28.494
Um, I told my dad
I had a study group.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.229
Ha, ha.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.231
I mean-- I mean, what does
Brenigan expect me to do?

35:32.264 --> 35:33.765
Jump up and down?

35:33.799 --> 35:36.902
Like, "Oh, I get to play
half my set?" No.

35:36.935 --> 35:40.539
What's Ray talking about?
Eh, it's nothing.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.242
Come on,
don't worry about it.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.177
Just tell me.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.912
Brenigan told us we don't get

35:46.945 --> 35:48.680
the full set
at the Halloween Bash.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.250
So...

35:51.283 --> 35:52.718
So you know that new girl,
Stella?

35:52.751 --> 35:54.386
Mm-hm.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.323
Yeah, well, I guess she told
Brenigan she has some band,

35:57.356 --> 35:58.924
and Miss Reznick is in on it.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.526
Miss Reznick
is a really talented

36:00.559 --> 36:02.194
music teacher, actually.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.263
Yeah, whatever. I mean,
that's not the point.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.698
The point is,
this so-called band

36:06.732 --> 36:09.268
has half our stage time now.
It's nuts.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.669
RAY:
You don't cancel the Crush.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.538
Um, do you know who else
is in the band?

36:12.571 --> 36:15.541
Nope.
Just a bunch of nobodies.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.676
PATTY:
Okay, and that's why--

36:17.709 --> 36:19.445
RAY:
Hey, hey, get away from my car.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.947
It's me.
What?

36:21.980 --> 36:24.816
I'm in the band.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.285
I play bass.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.720
( scoffs )

36:28.754 --> 36:30.989
I mean,
you're kidding, right?

36:31.022 --> 36:34.693
No. Actually,
we're not bad.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.562
I mean, we met in detention.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.630
( scoffs )

36:39.731 --> 36:41.600
We're just opening for you.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.703
Look, Mo, I mean, if you wanna
be in the band, that's great.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.573
You could play backup guitar
for me or something.

36:47.606 --> 36:48.907
But, come on,
joining a band

36:48.940 --> 36:50.709
that's taking half our night
from us?

36:50.742 --> 36:53.712
What's up with that?
What, so now it's your night?

36:53.745 --> 36:56.782
Yeah.
I mean, my music, it's--

36:56.815 --> 36:59.318
It's important to me.
You know that.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.887
Well, maybe my music
is important to me too.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.891
I'm sure it is.
It's just...

37:08.059 --> 37:10.262
Just think about it, okay?

37:10.296 --> 37:13.231
I mean, I really don't
want this to come between us.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.768
Me either.
It's... Ahh.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.505
Good. Good.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.907
Now, I'll be back
in a little bit, okay?

37:23.942 --> 37:27.012
I'm taking that band down
one way or another, okay?

37:27.045 --> 37:29.615
Ray. We're up, my man.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.418
All right, let's do this thing.
Yeah.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.685
( engine revs )

37:33.719 --> 37:35.521
( funky rock music
playing on bass )

37:35.554 --> 37:37.356
GIRL:
Yeah, I love this song!

37:37.389 --> 37:40.792
( crowd cheering )

37:48.934 --> 37:51.370
* Who's that trying
To talk to me? *

37:51.403 --> 37:54.072
* Standing over there
Looking like a wannabe *

37:54.105 --> 37:56.908
* Keep me on ice
Subzero degrees *

37:56.942 --> 37:59.778
* I'm so solid
That you can't see through me *

37:59.811 --> 38:02.414
* We rock the stage
Like a playoff game *

38:02.448 --> 38:04.916
* Don't have to say it
You know my name *

38:04.950 --> 38:07.653
* Three-point shot
No time on the clock *

38:07.686 --> 38:09.921
* And the crowd goes wild
Are you ready or not? *

38:09.955 --> 38:11.923
* Oh

38:11.957 --> 38:15.594
* And the crowd goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

38:15.627 --> 38:17.429
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

38:17.463 --> 38:21.099
* And the crowd goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

38:21.132 --> 38:23.802
* Oh, oh, oh, oh
And the crowd goes *

38:23.835 --> 38:25.971
* I'm a superstar
And I got a cool car *

38:26.004 --> 38:29.074
* And the girls like me better
Than whoever you are *

38:29.107 --> 38:31.543
* 'Cause I make your day
Let me hear you say *

38:31.577 --> 38:34.613
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

38:36.114 --> 38:38.316
Can you give me some of that?

38:40.719 --> 38:41.987
It's the Crush.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.562
* Here we go, here we go
And the crowd goes *

38:50.596 --> 38:52.831
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

38:52.864 --> 38:54.700
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

38:54.733 --> 38:58.470
* And the crowd goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

38:58.504 --> 38:59.705
* Oh, oh, oh, oh
Come on. What?

38:59.738 --> 39:01.440
* And the crowd goes

39:01.473 --> 39:03.509
* I'm a superstar
And I got a cool car *

39:03.542 --> 39:06.412
* And the girls like me better
Than whoever you are *

39:06.445 --> 39:08.980
* 'Cause I make your day
Let me hear you say *

39:09.014 --> 39:12.584
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

39:12.618 --> 39:15.521
( crowd cheering )

39:15.554 --> 39:19.891
We're Mudslide Crush.
Thank you for coming out. Whoo!

39:22.027 --> 39:23.729
( bell rings )

39:23.762 --> 39:26.765
( all chattering )

39:32.971 --> 39:35.106
( whispers ):
What's going on?

39:37.042 --> 39:41.480
Mudslide Crush. They're mad
we cut their show short.

39:41.513 --> 39:44.182
( in normal voice ): So?
So they're the cool guys.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.184
The pride of Mesa High.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.886
And what are we?

39:47.919 --> 39:51.757
We are rash-like, persistent.

39:51.790 --> 39:52.891
Hmm.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.927
Excellent.
After you.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.128
( Wen laughs )

39:57.162 --> 39:58.697
MO: Look at you.
OLIVIA: Yesterday.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.198
MO: Oh, okay.
OLIVIA: Yeah.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.034
I see everyone brought their
official underworld badges.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.636
MO & OLIVIA: Yeah.
Yeah.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.838
We're subterranean
and we're proud.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.073
MO: Yeah.
WEN: Mm-hm.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.443
( toilet flushing from above )

40:11.477 --> 40:12.778
( all laugh )

40:12.811 --> 40:14.513
Ew.

40:14.546 --> 40:18.517
All right. First order
of business: a band name.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.051
We need one for the fliers.
Right.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.087
Okay, okay.
What about Soul Groove?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.922
WEN: Mm. Mm-mm.
No. Oh.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.858
Um... The Anarchists?
WEN: No.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.194
Well, that's not so bad.
The Anarchists.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.196
No.
No.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.131
No, no, you're right,
it's terrible.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.067
Um, I'm gonna go
get another lemonade.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.703
All right,
look, guys, I got one.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.939
Um, let me just find it.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.575
Oh.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.477
Wen.
Wen?

40:45.511 --> 40:47.212
He's kidding, right?
Come on.

40:47.245 --> 40:51.483
It's the whole one-name thing.
You know, like, um... Mm.

40:51.517 --> 40:52.984
Like Bon Jovi.
Mm.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.986
Or Cher.
WEN: Ha, ha.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.222
Back off the bash.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.557
( Mo scoffs )

40:58.590 --> 41:00.258
What kind of band name
is that?

41:00.291 --> 41:01.693
WEN:
I love it.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.461
No, this was on the door.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.869
Good morning. Over the weekend,
I was notified

41:10.902 --> 41:13.104
that there was gum
found underneath

41:13.138 --> 41:15.874
the seats of the new bleachers
in the gym.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.578
This is a personal affront
to me.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.112
I've assigned seven students
as our...

41:21.146 --> 41:22.648
You haven't called me back.

41:22.681 --> 41:26.151
Sorry. You know,
I've just been distracted.

41:26.184 --> 41:29.220
Got band rehearsals,
soccer practice.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.758
I mean, you know how it is,
right?

41:34.760 --> 41:38.163
Okay, is that what
this is about? The band?

41:38.196 --> 41:40.866
No, no.
That is all.

41:40.899 --> 41:43.735
You know, I gotta go.

41:43.769 --> 41:45.203
I'll call you, all right?

41:47.673 --> 41:49.741
Sure you will.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.042
( sighs )

41:59.250 --> 42:03.955
If a guy doesn't call for a few
days, should the girl worry?

42:05.056 --> 42:07.292
Do guys do that?

42:07.325 --> 42:08.894
You're a guy, right?

42:08.927 --> 42:10.829
Heh. Wow.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.031
No, I just mean,
like, you're my friend.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.566
You're not,
like, a "guy" guy.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.035
Yeah,
that's not really helping.

42:17.068 --> 42:20.205
What's up. Am I interrupting?

42:26.211 --> 42:28.780
Thanks. My favorite.
Could I just have--?

42:28.814 --> 42:31.049
So hey, you're the lead singer
of the new band, right?

42:31.082 --> 42:32.818
Yeah.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.720
Oh, then why don't you just
belt one out for us?

42:34.753 --> 42:37.255
JULES: Show us what you've got.
Could you just leave me alone?

42:37.288 --> 42:40.992
What's going on?
We're just making small talk.

42:41.026 --> 42:43.995
Ray, come on, bro.
Just leave her alone.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.798
And are you gonna make me?
You're being a creep, Ray.

42:46.832 --> 42:48.800
( Ray scoffs )

42:48.834 --> 42:51.336
So if you're not gonna make me,
then who's gonna make me?

42:51.369 --> 42:53.338
Me.

42:53.371 --> 42:55.106
That's who.
You?

42:55.140 --> 42:56.274
Yeah.
Yeah?

42:56.307 --> 42:57.943
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.678
Can't--?
Can't we talk this through?

42:59.711 --> 43:00.946
No, we can't talk it through,
no.

43:00.979 --> 43:02.814
Wen? Wen?
Wen.

43:02.848 --> 43:05.817
Yeah?
A little help here, please.

43:05.851 --> 43:07.352
No, no, I'm a lover,
not a fighter, bro.

43:07.385 --> 43:08.954
Perfect.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.689
RAY: Yeah, yeah.
Go help him.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.891
Can you just make it quick?
Make it quick? Yeah.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.960
STELLA:
I have a better idea.

43:14.993 --> 43:17.295
What?
One second.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.632
Unh!
CROWD: Whoa!

43:20.666 --> 43:24.269
( all laughing )

43:24.302 --> 43:25.904
You think it's funny?
Is that what it is?

43:25.937 --> 43:28.373
No, it's not funny.
I'm sorry.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.375
You're cra-- No. No, no, no.
MO: Back off.

43:30.408 --> 43:33.144
BRENIGAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
MO: Guys, stop it.

43:33.178 --> 43:35.280
Break it up here, break it up.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.115
Step away
from the puddle, people.

43:37.148 --> 43:38.784
What is going on here?

43:38.817 --> 43:41.753
Principal Brenigan,
I went to go get a TurboBlast,

43:41.787 --> 43:43.855
and they just
start threatening me.

43:43.889 --> 43:47.125
Next thing you know it,
lemonade mouth over here

43:47.158 --> 43:49.160
spits all over me.

43:49.194 --> 43:51.730
( all arguing indistinctly )

43:51.763 --> 43:53.431
RAY:
Look at my clothes.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.901
( all arguing indistinctly )

43:55.934 --> 43:57.402
RAY:
We didn't do anything.

43:57.435 --> 44:02.340
OLIVIA:
And that is how we got
our band name.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.642
( upbeat rock theme playing )

44:14.786 --> 44:16.021
Hey.

44:16.054 --> 44:18.423
What are you doing here?
Uh...

44:18.456 --> 44:22.327
Stella said I should come by,
work on some songs with you.

44:23.795 --> 44:25.096
Oh.

44:25.130 --> 44:26.664
Okay.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.169
So, uh...

44:31.202 --> 44:33.972
Oh, right. Sorry. Um...

44:35.974 --> 44:38.043
Come on in.

44:38.076 --> 44:40.145
All right.
Oh, wow.

44:41.346 --> 44:44.482
OLIVIA: Thanks, Gram.
GRAM: Mm-hm.

44:44.515 --> 44:47.685
So you're Olivia's friend?

44:49.120 --> 44:50.789
That's right.

44:50.822 --> 44:52.457
I've never met
one of Olivia's friends before.

44:52.490 --> 44:55.693
Um... Gram, mm-mm.
Hmm?

44:57.763 --> 44:59.798
She was just kidding
about the whole friend thing.

44:59.831 --> 45:03.434
She's met a ton of my friends.
Like, tons and tons.

45:05.003 --> 45:07.072
Friends.
Right.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.940
Of course.

45:08.974 --> 45:10.341
You wanna hear a rap?
Oh, yes.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.078
Yeah? All right. Um...
Okay.

45:13.111 --> 45:15.280
* It's Wen
And I'm musically inclined *

45:15.313 --> 45:17.515
* Get a shiver down your spine
Every time I rhyme *

45:17.548 --> 45:20.018
* I'm in Lemonade Mouth
We don't learn to wait *

45:20.051 --> 45:22.220
* We get on stage
And determinate *

45:22.253 --> 45:23.354
( mimics record scratching )

45:23.388 --> 45:24.956
* Determin--
Ha, ha.

45:24.990 --> 45:26.958
Like, it would keep going.
Wait, "determinate"?

45:26.992 --> 45:29.861
Yeah. It's like,
get determined.

45:29.895 --> 45:30.962
Ha, ha.

45:30.996 --> 45:32.764
Like, put on your game face.
Yes.

45:32.798 --> 45:36.401
Oh, I'm sorry. That is so not
what "determinate" means.

45:36.434 --> 45:38.036
( cat meows )

45:38.069 --> 45:41.472
Wow.
That is an old cat.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.846
( melancholy theme playing )

45:47.879 --> 45:49.981
Yeah.

45:50.015 --> 45:52.217
Yeah, she's really old.

45:53.484 --> 45:54.953
Are you okay?

45:57.422 --> 45:59.090
Yeah. Um...

46:00.325 --> 46:02.127
( sniffs )

46:02.160 --> 46:04.562
Nancy was my mom's,
and so she's just kind of like

46:04.595 --> 46:08.299
the last real thing I have left
of her, so...

46:10.168 --> 46:11.937
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:14.039 --> 46:15.907
Well, what about your dad?

46:18.309 --> 46:20.545
He...

46:20.578 --> 46:22.213
Um...

46:22.247 --> 46:24.349
You know, can we just
work on the songs?

46:24.382 --> 46:25.917
Yeah.

46:25.951 --> 46:27.452
Because I--

46:27.485 --> 46:29.154
I have this one
that I think is pretty good.

46:29.187 --> 46:30.889
Uh-oh.

46:30.922 --> 46:33.591
So, um, here.

46:33.624 --> 46:34.960
( playing soft pop music )

46:34.993 --> 46:36.527
Okay.

46:37.929 --> 46:39.898
Right.

46:39.931 --> 46:42.200
And then...
Okay.

46:42.233 --> 46:46.037
* Trying hard to fight
These tears *

46:46.071 --> 46:49.174
* I'm crazy worried

46:49.207 --> 46:53.044
* Messing with my head
This fear *

46:53.078 --> 46:55.914
* I'm so sorry

46:55.947 --> 46:59.584
BOTH:
* You know you gotta
Get it out *

46:59.617 --> 47:02.854
* I can take it

47:02.888 --> 47:06.858
* That's what
Being a friend's about *

47:08.359 --> 47:11.529
( tender theme playing )

47:15.400 --> 47:17.502
I like when you smile.

47:19.104 --> 47:20.605
Ha, ha. Sorry, I--

47:20.638 --> 47:23.474
No, it, um...

47:23.508 --> 47:25.944
Right, so--
Yeah, we should... Ahem.

47:25.977 --> 47:28.279
Basically, it just picks up
a little bit

47:28.313 --> 47:29.447
and we go through, like,

47:29.480 --> 47:31.016
this slow portion
of the song, right?

47:31.049 --> 47:34.085
And then I was thinking
that...

47:34.119 --> 47:37.222
Well, this is it, guys.
Our last rehearsal.

47:37.255 --> 47:39.390
Lyle.
( Wen chuckles )

47:39.424 --> 47:40.525
Guys, I can't believe

47:40.558 --> 47:42.260
the Halloween Bash
is tomorrow night.

47:42.293 --> 47:45.130
And Rising Star
in a few weeks.

47:49.434 --> 47:51.402
You okay?

47:51.436 --> 47:54.139
Fine, fine. I'm totally fine.

47:55.540 --> 47:58.576
We're all nervous, Olivia.
Try terrified.

47:58.609 --> 48:03.414
Hey, come on, you guys,
we're gonna be great.

48:03.448 --> 48:06.251
In fact, I think I know
just the thing

48:06.284 --> 48:07.518
to make us feel better.

48:07.552 --> 48:08.686
( Wen gasps )

48:08.719 --> 48:10.555
ALL:
Lemonade.

48:10.588 --> 48:11.923
( all chuckle )

48:15.193 --> 48:16.427
I'd like to know
what's happening

48:16.461 --> 48:18.263
to the lemonade machine
in the basement.

48:18.296 --> 48:21.132
There's a lemonade machine
down there?

48:21.166 --> 48:23.301
Yeah, for now.

48:24.970 --> 48:27.405
And I'd like to know
why it's being removed.

48:27.438 --> 48:29.274
Oh...
Hey, we--

48:29.307 --> 48:30.575
We were just wondering

48:30.608 --> 48:32.710
if it's gonna be replaced
or repaired.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.412
You know, any information
you have, we--

48:34.445 --> 48:36.714
We would really
appreciate it.

48:36.747 --> 48:39.717
Well, I'm sure it's just
a mix-up.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.954
( whispers ):
See? Just relax.

48:47.725 --> 48:50.295
Uh-huh. Oh.

48:50.328 --> 48:51.963
Oh, well.

48:51.997 --> 48:55.733
Well, that machine
should have been gone ages ago.

48:55.766 --> 48:58.236
Well, what with Principal
Brenigan's sponsorship deal.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.172
( in a normal voice ):
A sponsorship?

49:01.206 --> 49:04.175
TurboBlast donated the gym
and the scoreboard,

49:04.209 --> 49:05.710
and we have to
get rid of

49:05.743 --> 49:08.179
any competing drink machines.
Ha, ha.

49:08.213 --> 49:12.250
What? That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.719
Now, I don't care for your tone,
young lady.

49:14.752 --> 49:17.522
I suggest if you have
any more questions,

49:17.555 --> 49:21.092
you bring them up
to Principal Brenigan yourself.

49:21.126 --> 49:23.094
( whispers ):
It's okay. Relax.

49:23.128 --> 49:25.363
Yeah, so like I was saying,
Maureen,

49:25.396 --> 49:27.598
he told me I looked nice
and he smiled at me. Ha, ha.

49:27.632 --> 49:29.500
We're not going down
without a fight.

49:29.534 --> 49:32.370
( in normal voice ):
Ahh. Look, it's just a machine,
Stella.

49:32.403 --> 49:36.074
No, it's not.
It's more than that.

49:36.107 --> 49:39.510
Afternoon, students.
Are we having a good day?

49:39.544 --> 49:42.380
Yeah.
Thank you, Faye.

49:58.796 --> 50:00.498
Hey there, buddy.
You're home early.

50:00.531 --> 50:03.501
Yeah, practice sort
of got cancelled.

50:03.534 --> 50:06.071
What's all this?

50:11.409 --> 50:13.144
Sydney's stuff.

50:14.345 --> 50:17.182
( tender theme playing )

50:20.585 --> 50:22.420
Um, what's it doing here?

50:24.355 --> 50:25.556
( sighs )

50:27.192 --> 50:31.062
Look, I know
this has been tough for you.

50:31.096 --> 50:33.664
Mom leaving,
me moving on.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.566
But whatever issues
you're having with Sydney,

50:35.600 --> 50:37.435
we have to
figure them out,

50:37.468 --> 50:39.304
because she makes me happy,
Wen.

50:39.337 --> 50:40.538
Yeah.

50:40.571 --> 50:42.507
And I've asked her
to marry me.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.449
Wen.

50:59.624 --> 51:01.626
WOMAN: Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.761
Hey, Mo.

51:03.794 --> 51:05.430
What's up with you?

51:05.463 --> 51:08.099
Nothing. Hey, have you seen
the new weight room?

51:08.133 --> 51:09.300
What?

51:09.334 --> 51:11.702
Oh, okay. You gotta
check it out.

51:11.736 --> 51:14.439
It's really great.
Okay.

51:14.472 --> 51:16.707
So how's that whole band thing
working out for you, anyway?

51:16.741 --> 51:18.576
Yeah, it's great. Um...
What are you up to?

51:18.609 --> 51:20.311
SCOTT:
Can you tell
I've been working out?

51:20.345 --> 51:22.613
Seriously, I don't have
time for your games.

51:28.253 --> 51:30.221
Hey, Mo. You know
Jules, right?

51:31.922 --> 51:33.491
No, wait, Mo.

51:33.524 --> 51:35.626
Let her go. Whoa.
She's made her choice.

51:35.660 --> 51:38.163
Hey, good luck tonight.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.602
( hip hop music playing )

51:44.635 --> 51:47.338
( all chattering )

51:47.372 --> 51:49.607
Yeah. What's up, man?

51:49.640 --> 51:51.742
( speaking indistinctly )

51:51.776 --> 51:53.611
* Show 'em all why

51:53.644 --> 51:55.546
STELLA:
She promised she'd be here.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.515
Maybe she just
got held up.

51:57.548 --> 51:59.350
Ah. We're on
in ten minutes.

51:59.384 --> 52:01.286
WEN:
Oh. Guys,

52:01.319 --> 52:02.920
( Wen panting )

52:02.953 --> 52:04.389
I can't find her
anywhere.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.427
I don't have time.
Those Mudslide jerks

52:09.460 --> 52:11.496
wrecked my setup
before sound check.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.298
I'm telling you, it's sabotage.

52:13.331 --> 52:16.301
Doesn't matter. We can't go on
without a lead singer.

52:16.334 --> 52:19.370
Who, Olivia? She ran through
here a couple minutes ago.

52:19.404 --> 52:21.706
What?
That way.

52:21.739 --> 52:23.374
Looked like she was
gonna hurl.

52:23.408 --> 52:25.376
MAN ( on speaker ):
* Turn it around

52:25.410 --> 52:26.611
* Yeah

52:31.216 --> 52:33.584
* Yeah, yeah
Come on, come on *

52:33.618 --> 52:35.386
* Yeah, unh

52:35.420 --> 52:37.255
* Show 'em what you're made of
Boy *

52:37.288 --> 52:41.792
So I think those lemon heads
are bailing on you, Mr. B.

52:41.826 --> 52:42.927
Is that right?
Yeah.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.929
You know, we got
two sets ready.

52:44.962 --> 52:48.399
We'd be happy to go on early
and cover. Hmm?

52:48.433 --> 52:49.834
Hmm.

52:51.869 --> 52:53.704
Give me one second.

52:55.573 --> 52:57.842
MAN ( on speaker ):
* Yeah, just turn it around

52:58.976 --> 53:00.278
* Come on

53:00.311 --> 53:02.280
BRENIGAN: Jenny.
Huh? Oh. Ha, ha.

53:02.313 --> 53:04.549
Do I need to be worried?
Huh?

53:04.582 --> 53:07.685
Oh, no, they'll be fine.
They'll be ready.

53:07.718 --> 53:09.320
( laughs )

53:09.354 --> 53:10.688
Oh, look at that costume
over there.

53:10.721 --> 53:12.357
What do we got?

53:12.390 --> 53:15.293
MAN ( on speaker ):
* Turn it around

53:15.326 --> 53:16.727
STELLA:
Are you in here, Olivia?

53:20.531 --> 53:21.699
Olivia?

53:21.732 --> 53:23.301
( toilet flushes )

53:23.334 --> 53:25.436
Oh, sorry, Janet.

53:25.470 --> 53:26.971
Found her.
She's in there.

53:27.004 --> 53:28.706
WEN:
I'm going in. Okay, we--
I'm going.

53:28.739 --> 53:30.308
We're coming in.

53:30.341 --> 53:31.609
We can't go
in the girls' bathroom.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.449
How you feeling, Olivia?

53:38.483 --> 53:40.451
OLIVIA:
I'm great. Super.

53:40.485 --> 53:41.919
Ah! That's my girl.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.721
That's great.

53:43.754 --> 53:46.591
But it's probably not
the best idea

53:46.624 --> 53:48.726
for me to actually go out there.

53:48.759 --> 53:49.927
You know, physically.

53:51.562 --> 53:55.466
We got plenty, thank you.
Maybe next door. Sorry.

53:55.500 --> 53:59.737
Olivia, we've rehearsed
these songs a million times.

53:59.770 --> 54:02.440
We've put everything we have
in these songs.

54:04.409 --> 54:06.477
I know, and I'm scared.

54:06.511 --> 54:08.479
Look, we're all scared.

54:08.513 --> 54:09.880
( whispers ):
We have like six minutes.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.549
What are we gonna do?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.684
STELLA ( in normal voice ):
I don't know.

54:13.718 --> 54:15.252
What's that?

54:16.521 --> 54:18.356
STELLA:
Cool, right?

54:18.389 --> 54:21.526
( tender theme playing )

54:24.829 --> 54:26.331
( whispers ):
Olivia.

54:31.402 --> 54:34.405
( in normal voice ):
Look, we believe in you, okay?

54:35.806 --> 54:37.675
I believe in you.

54:43.414 --> 54:44.649
( can opens )

54:44.682 --> 54:45.950
( Olivia slurps )

54:50.721 --> 54:51.756
OLIVIA:
Ah.

54:55.360 --> 54:57.061
I'm ready.
Yes!

54:57.094 --> 54:58.829
Yeah!
Now we're going out there.

55:01.699 --> 55:03.000
( crowd boos )

55:03.033 --> 55:05.403
Hey, nice costumes.

55:05.436 --> 55:06.937
Oh, you're not wearing any?

55:06.971 --> 55:08.673
( Patty & Jules laugh )

55:08.706 --> 55:10.441
Hey, come on.
Quit it.

55:13.611 --> 55:16.614
( playing soft pop music )

55:21.652 --> 55:25.456
* Trying hard
To fight these tears *

55:25.490 --> 55:28.559
* I'm crazy worried

55:28.593 --> 55:32.563
* Messing with my head
This fear *

55:32.597 --> 55:33.831
* I'm so sorry

55:33.864 --> 55:35.433
( yawns )

55:35.466 --> 55:39.036
* You know you gotta
Get it out *

55:39.069 --> 55:42.106
* I can take it

55:42.139 --> 55:47.478
* That's what
Being a friend's about *

55:49.647 --> 55:52.383
* I, I wanna cry

55:52.417 --> 55:53.884
* I can't deny

55:53.918 --> 55:57.455
* Tonight I wanna up and hide

55:57.488 --> 55:59.123
* And get inside

55:59.156 --> 56:00.725
* It isn't right

56:00.758 --> 56:03.394
* I gotta live in my life

56:03.428 --> 56:06.897
* I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it *

56:06.931 --> 56:10.735
* I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it *

56:10.768 --> 56:12.470
OLIVIA, MO & STELLA:
* Gotta turn the world

56:12.503 --> 56:13.938
* Into your dance floor

56:13.971 --> 56:17.408
* Determinate
D-- Determinate *

56:17.442 --> 56:20.911
* Push until you can't
And then demand more *

56:20.945 --> 56:23.881
* Determinate
D-- Determinate *

56:23.914 --> 56:27.418
* You and me together

56:27.452 --> 56:31.021

Into your dance floor *

56:34.792 --> 56:37.495
* Determinate
D-- Determinate *

56:37.528 --> 56:40.197
* Hate to feel this way

56:40.230 --> 56:42.099
* And waste a day

56:42.132 --> 56:45.503
* I gotta get myself on-stage

56:45.536 --> 56:48.839
* I shouldn't wait
Or be afraid *

56:48.873 --> 56:51.509
* The chips will fall
Where they may *

56:51.542 --> 56:54.912
* I know I, I know I, I know
I gotta do it *

56:54.945 --> 56:58.716
* I know I, I know I, I know
I gotta do it *

56:58.749 --> 57:00.518
OLIVIA, MO & STELLA:

Music like a veteran *

57:26.777 --> 57:28.746
* Renegade lemonade
Use it in my medicine *

57:28.779 --> 57:30.748
* Go ahead and try to name
A band we ain't better than *

57:30.781 --> 57:32.950
* Reason why the whole world's
Picking us instead of them *

57:32.983 --> 57:34.752
* People need a breather
Feeling adrenaline *

57:34.785 --> 57:36.086
* Stop
Hurry up and let us in *

57:36.120 --> 57:37.955
* Knock
We're coming to your house *

57:37.988 --> 57:40.558
* People keep smiling
Like a lemon's in their mouth *

57:40.591 --> 57:42.727
* We're not in it for the mill
We're just in it for a thrill *

57:42.760 --> 57:44.128
* Get down now
I ain't playin' around *

57:44.161 --> 57:45.563
* Put your feet up
On the ground

That sound like *

58:06.651 --> 58:09.253
He's so cool.
Be quiet.

58:27.905 --> 58:30.741
( crowd cheering and whistling )

58:30.775 --> 58:32.076
Looks like we got
some competition

58:32.109 --> 58:33.644
at Rising Star,
man.

58:33.678 --> 58:35.279
Huh? You know,
they're not that good.

58:35.312 --> 58:37.748
No, man.
They're great.

58:37.782 --> 58:39.183
OLIVIA:
Okay.

58:39.216 --> 58:41.819
Well, we're Lemonade Mouth.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.621
And now a few words

58:43.654 --> 58:45.289
from our lead guitarist,
Stella Yamada.

58:45.322 --> 58:47.024
Yeah!
RAY: No!

58:47.057 --> 58:48.559
( crowd cheering )

58:50.194 --> 58:54.665
Come on. Everybody, we want you
to pass these back, so hurry up.

58:54.699 --> 58:56.767
We'd like to shine a light
on a recent change

58:56.801 --> 58:58.035
that affects us all.

58:58.068 --> 58:59.637
We'd like to talk about...

58:59.670 --> 59:00.938
( plays drum roll )

59:00.971 --> 59:02.172
lemonade.

59:02.206 --> 59:03.774
( crowd cheers )

59:03.808 --> 59:05.309
The Mel's Lemonade machine
in the basement

59:05.342 --> 59:08.112
is scheduled for removal
to help pay for this gymnasium.

59:08.145 --> 59:09.947
( crowd boos )

59:09.980 --> 59:12.650
It's about this school,
it's treating certain people

59:12.683 --> 59:14.985
like they matter
more than others.

59:15.019 --> 59:16.654
Or like funding for sports

59:16.687 --> 59:18.589
is more important
than a music program.

59:18.623 --> 59:19.924
( crowd boos )

59:19.957 --> 59:23.994
Or a school newspaper,
or any one of us.

59:24.028 --> 59:25.663
Do you know
about this?

59:25.696 --> 59:26.964
( stammers )

59:26.997 --> 59:29.066
We all deserve to be treated
like we matter.

59:29.099 --> 59:30.200
( crowd cheers )

59:30.234 --> 59:32.069
Because, ladies and gentlemen,

59:32.102 --> 59:33.604
( plays drum roll )

59:33.638 --> 59:35.606
we do matter!

Mohini, I will call your father.
BAND: * You gotta hear me now

I said we're tired of this.
Wen, what are you doing?

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:47.912
STELLA:
We're gonna stand up
for what we believe in.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:49.780
BRENIGAN: Listen to me!
We might be on our own,

01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:51.148
but we are one.

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:52.216
Oh, ho, ho.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:53.951

( crowd groaning )

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.437
Well, well, well.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:16.306
( Brenigan clapping )

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.911
That was quite a show you all
put on at the Halloween Bash.

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:23.047
Mm. Heh, heh.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.883
You're very talented. Very.

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:31.922
But just for your information,

01:01:31.956 --> 01:01:36.193
a high school dance is no place
for a...political tirade.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:37.795
Yeah.

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:41.198
What you did Friday night
was completely...

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:43.934
Completely disruptive.

01:01:43.968 --> 01:01:46.336
And you.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.873
You promised
there'd be no funny business.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:51.942
But it wasn't funny.
( Brenigan scoffs )

01:01:51.976 --> 01:01:53.377
We just spoke our minds and--

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.813
Principal Brenigan,
you shut us down.

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:58.348
Yes, I shut you down,
because the decisions I make

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:02.019
are for the good of this school,
okay?

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.288
And with that good in mind,

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.258
Lemonade Mouth is finished.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.229
You will not use the music room.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.431
You will not use
the instruments.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.233
If I hear so much as a hum

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:18.268
coming from
the locker-room showers,

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:22.139
I will suspend you.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.810
Understood?

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:30.480
Good. Dismissed.

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:45.896
Psst.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.935
WEN ( whispers ):
What's this?

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:53.137
( whispers ):
It's you.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.039
Your show.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.075
Listen, a bunch of kids

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.077
have been asking
if they can buy them.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.378
I hope you don't mind,

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.013
but I've already sold
like five copies,

01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:04.949
10 bucks a pop.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.818
I figure, you know,
AV club gets 30 percent,

01:03:07.852 --> 01:03:09.486
and you take the rest.

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.055
Deal?

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.161
Yeah.

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:19.063
Excellent.

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:25.169
STELLA:
"This year's Halloween Bash
will best be remembered

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.603

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.309
"A champion

01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:35.913
Can you believe it?

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:37.381
Our first review.

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:40.084
And last, apparently.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:44.488
( girls giggling )

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.227
Huh. I think they like us.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.163
Ha, ha. I'm not sure
it's us they like, Charlie.

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:55.532
What do you mean?

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:56.934

Never mind. Never mind.

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.364
Awesome. Lemonade Mouth.
Oh, hey.

Hi.
Hey.

BOY: Hey, Olivia.
Hi.

01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:35.105
Oh, sorry. Sorry, Alex.
Hi.

01:04:35.139 --> 01:04:38.275
* You think you've seen it
All before *

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:41.178
That's Lemonade Mouth.
That's our band.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:44.248
That's us. Oh, my gosh.
I know.

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:46.050
* Just watch me now

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.118
BRENIGAN:
Don't poke it.
You've gotta pull it down.

01:04:48.152 --> 01:04:50.287
Just yank it right off the wa--

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.058
Hey, Stella.
Come here.

01:04:57.294 --> 01:05:01.098
Now, I thought
I made myself clear.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:05.469
This lemonade business
is over.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:09.306
It wasn't us.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.009
( scoffs )

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.144
You're playing
a dangerous game here, miss.

01:05:14.178 --> 01:05:15.345
We had nothing to do
with that.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.581
And you're gonna lose.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:23.020
Hector,
it is not a piÃ±ata.

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:25.589
Don't poke it, hit it.
Take it down!

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:30.094
What would you say...

01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:35.699
If, um, we told you we could
play again?

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.102
Heh. I'd say
you're nuts.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:40.304
Brenigan is never
gonna change his mind.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:42.539
We're not talking
about at school.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.709
We're talking about here.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:48.245
Here?
Mm-hm.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.114
Look, guys, I--

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:54.284
I gave Dante our CD,
and he loved it.

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:58.188
Yeah, and he said
we could start playing here.

01:05:58.222 --> 01:06:00.457
Principal Brenigan can tell us
we can't play at school,

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.326
but he can't tell us
not to play here.

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:03.727
And it could
become a regular gig.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.995
Mm-hm.

01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:06.096
( sighs )

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:07.464
Wait, wait, a regular gig?

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.099
I barely made it through
the first one.

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:10.500
Guys,
my parents already think

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.569
I'm at soccer practice
every afternoon.

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.472
There's no way
I can pull this off.

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:18.508
Me either.
Scott eats here,

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:21.478
and I'm pretty much planning on
not seeing him again

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:22.579
for the rest of my life.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:28.618
Guys, we mean something
to people.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:31.755
Lemonade Mouth
is their voice.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.357
( door opens )

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.159
STELLA:
It's like we're at the center

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.227
of a movement here.

01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:40.297
JULES: Hi.
WEN: Maybe if...

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.498
STELLA: I mean, it--
Guys,

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:43.033
good luck
with your movement,

01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:46.070
but I've got
homework to do.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.676
Mo.
STELLA: Let's go.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.283
Mo, you okay?

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:03.420
( chuckles )

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:05.389
( Stella & Charlie chuckle )

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:07.524
WEN:
What?

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:08.525
No way.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:09.659
( gasps )

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.561
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:13.730
Look at us up there.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:16.566
Maybe we do matter.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.268
Of course we do.

01:07:18.302 --> 01:07:20.137
OLIVIA:
Before we knew it,
we were playing

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.672
at Dante's Pizzeria
every Thursday night.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.708
Standing room only.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:29.579
We were ready for Rising Star.
We were ready to be heard.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.716
( playing upbeat rock music )

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:38.822
* Insecure in her skin

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:42.159
* Like a puppet
A girl on a string *

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:45.695
* Broke away, learned to fly

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:49.199
MO & OLIVIA:
* If you want her back
Gotta let her shine *

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:52.436
* So it looks like
The joke's on you *

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:55.439
* 'Cause the girl
That you thought you knew *

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:58.642
* She's so gone
CHORUS: * She's so gone

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:02.179
* That's so over now

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:05.582
* She's so gone
CHORUS: * She's so gone

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:09.453
* You won't find her around

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:12.756
* You can look
But you won't see *

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:16.593
* The girl I used to be

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:19.196
* 'Cause she

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:22.732
* She's so gone away

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.669
* Like history

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:29.473
* She's so gone

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:34.511
* Baby, this is me, yeah

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.884
* She's so gone
CHORUS: * She's so gone

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.388
* That's so over now

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:47.890
* She's so gone
CHORUS: * She's so gone

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:51.495
* You won't find her around

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:55.232
* You can look
But you won't see *

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:58.768
* The girl I used to be

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.305
* 'Cause she

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:04.707
* She's so gone
CHORUS: * She's so gone

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:08.212
* That's so over now

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:11.581
* She's so gone
CHORUS: * She's so gone

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:15.252
* You won't find her around

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:18.787
* You can look
But you won't see *

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:22.292
* The girl I used to be

01:09:22.326 --> 01:09:24.828
* 'Cause she

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.496
* She's so gone

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:34.304
* So long
She's so gone *

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.711
( crowd cheering and whistling )

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.420
OLIVIA:
Lemonade Mouth
was officially a sensation.

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:52.421
GIRL 1:
Will you autograph my CD?

01:09:52.456 --> 01:09:55.992
OLIVIA:
And five strangers
were suddenly much, much more.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.361
We were friends.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:00.830
GIRL 2:
Can I get your autograph?

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.566
GIRL 3:
Would you listen to my demo?

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:04.368
GIRL 4:
Charlie!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.376
( scoffs )

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:13.843
( bell rings )

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.011
( Wen speaking indistinctly )

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.781
( Stella chuckles )

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:21.451
What's up, guys?
Has anyone seen Olivia today?

01:10:21.485 --> 01:10:23.353
I haven't seen her all day.
No?

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:34.864
( tender theme playing )

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.900
( sniffs )

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:38.935
You okay?

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.337
( sniffs )

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.472
Yeah, you came.

01:10:42.506 --> 01:10:44.741
We all did.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:47.644
Hey.
Hey, Olivia.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:54.050
Look, I'm-- I'm really sorry
about Nancy.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.953
Yeah, me too.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:11:00.590
Hey, it's nice out here.

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:06.363
Yeah. Sometimes I like
to look up,

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:08.732
and see what shapes I can find.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.800
You know, in the clouds.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:14.771
It's a giant old lady with a...

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:16.973
A skirt and an umbrella.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:21.277
See, there...
There's a flower in a vase.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.582
Oh, I see a hand.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:28.452
WEN:
No, you're way off. It's a...

01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:32.789
It's a alien pushing
a baby carriage.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:35.325
( Wen and Mo chuckle )

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:37.427
All I see is a blob.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.732
Sometimes I think I'm too stupid
to be in my family.

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:47.437
Like I'm just some big letdown.

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:52.576
No wonder my mom ignores me.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:56.580
I wish my dad
would ignore me.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:57.981
( sighs )

01:11:58.014 --> 01:11:59.683
I'm never gonna live up
to this idea he has

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:01.551
of this perfect Indian daughter,
you know?

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:04.120
Heh. Try living up
to a perfect brother.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.822
( scoffs )

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:07.857
I'd take
perfect brother any day

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:10.894
over my dad's
ridiculous girlfriend.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.662
My dad's in prison.

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:19.836
( sniffing )

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.337
Ugh.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.140
I just--

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:28.778
I'm too humiliated to talk
to him or about him and...

01:12:30.614 --> 01:12:34.017
You know, he writes,
but I don't write back,

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.652
because I don't know
what to say.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.654
I mean,

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.856
he's made
some really bad decisions

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:42.659
since my mom died,

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:45.028
and I still love him, but he's--

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.030
He's a stranger now, you know?

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:52.669
Which is why I'm so glad to have
this, you know.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.738
Our friendship.
Mm.

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:58.141
Yeah. Okay.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:01.645
( playing soft acoustic music )

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:11.087
* I can't pretend
To know how you feel *

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.892
* But know that I'm here
Know that I'm real *

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:20.497
* Say what you want
Or don't talk at all *

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:25.034
* Not gonna let you fall

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:29.806
* Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you *

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:34.511
* My shoulders are small
But you can cry on them too *

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.580
* Everything changes

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:41.117
* But one thing is true
Understand *

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:46.122
* We'll always be
More than a band *

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:52.796
* Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah *

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:57.534
* You used to brave the world
All on your own *

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:02.071
* Now we won't let you go
Go it alone *

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:06.810
* Be who you wanna be
Always stand tall *

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:11.214
STELLA & CHARLIE:
* Not gonna let you fall

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:15.852
BAND:
* Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you *

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:20.824
* My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too *

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:22.626
* Everything changes

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:27.497
* But one thing is true
Understand *

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:30.233
* We'll always be
More than a band *

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:34.738
* I never knew
You could take me so far *

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:38.241
* I've always wanted the hope

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:44.113
* That you are
The ones I need *

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:48.585
* Yeah *

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:52.856
BAND:
* Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you *

01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:57.594
* My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too *

01:14:57.627 --> 01:14:59.729
* Everything changes

01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:04.267
* But one thing is true
Understand *

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.003
* We'll always be
More than a band *

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:11.174
* Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you *

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:16.045
* My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too *

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:18.014
* Everything changes

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:22.886
* But one thing is true
Understand *

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:29.559
* We'll always be
More than a band *

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:36.633
Hey.

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:38.067
Oh, come on, Mo.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.636
Can we please just talk?

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.037
We don't have anything
to talk about.

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:42.171
I think we do.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.940
Look, Mo,
I made a mistake.

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:49.913
Look, Mo.

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:51.314
( sighs )

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.249
I still have feelings for you.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.319
What about Jules?

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:59.155
Mo, come on, we're just friends.
That's all.

01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:03.827
The thing is, Scott,

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:07.731
I'm not the same girl
I was two months ago.

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:11.601
Not anymore.
I'm not trying to be

01:16:11.635 --> 01:16:13.670
something that I'm not,
you know?

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.104
Not for anyone.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:20.276
Me, my music,
we're a package deal now.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:23.246
Okay, and I know.
I get that now, I do.

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:29.819
And I'm sorry, Mo. I am.

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.187
Just...

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:33.890
Can you forgive me?

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:37.994
Of course I can.

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.733
But it doesn't change
anything between us.

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:45.068
Okay?

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:49.605
It's gonna take a lot more than
"sorry" to fix this.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.943
Come on, Mo,
just wait. Mo.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.415
The band was, uh... Ha, ha.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:02.719
Was originally called Wen.

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:04.654
And, I know, but after about

01:17:04.688 --> 01:17:06.656
months and months of arguing,
uh,

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:08.024
and debating the--
Wen.

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.726
Don't you knock?
Yes.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:13.429
No. Just-- Come on.
You've got to hear this.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.800
OLIVIA ( on radio ):
* I can't deny
Tonight I wanna up and hide *

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.936
Listen. Your song.
* And get inside

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:21.871
It's you. Ha, ha.
What?

01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:23.773
Yes. Ha-ha-ha.

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:26.209
Yes! What?
It's you.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:28.277
That's incredible.
MR. GIFFORD: What's going on?

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.947
We're on the radio.
Ha-ha-ha.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.182
( all laughing )

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:35.018
( classical music
playing on radio )

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:36.686
( phone rings )

01:17:37.721 --> 01:17:39.022
Hello?

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:41.758
WEN ( over phone ):
Turn on WRIZ.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:42.926
( line clicks )

01:17:48.832 --> 01:17:51.901
( static crackling )

01:17:51.935 --> 01:17:54.938
OLIVIA ( on radio ):
* I gotta get myself on-stage

01:17:54.971 --> 01:17:56.305
* I shouldn't wait

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.307
Gram. Gram.
They're playing our song.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.043
On the radio.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:02.311
They're playing our song
on the radio! Yes! Yes!

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:03.813
( Olivia shrieks )

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:05.314
( Olivia hums along to radio )

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:07.116
OLIVIA:
The radio sponsor
for Rising Star

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:08.985
heard our demo
and put it on the air.

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:12.455
It was a dream come true.
For all of us.

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:15.391
WEN ( on radio ):
* I'm the real deal
You know how I feel *

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.861
* We're not in it for the mill
We're just in it for a thrill *

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:20.463
* Get down now
I ain't playin' around *

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:22.098
OLIVIA:
But just when the future

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:24.367
looked brightest
for Lemonade Mouth,

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.803
everything started
to fall apart.

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:28.404
( band playing soft pop music )

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.073
( sneezes )

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:32.976
OLIVIA:
* Set free what
Is inside of me *

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:36.012
( Mo coughing )

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:39.115
Mo, you sure you're okay?

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.516
Yeah, I think
it's just allergies.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.752
* It's a long way down
But I say *

01:18:42.786 --> 01:18:46.089
* Oh, we're gonna let it show

01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:47.490
* We're gonna
Losers.

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:50.093
I'm just saying,

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:51.961
I'm gonna take you down
at Rising Star tomorrow.

01:18:51.995 --> 01:18:56.099
You just wait.
Look, just ignore him.

01:18:56.132 --> 01:18:59.035
* Back our dreams and try--

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.369
All right, thanks.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.105
Hey, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:05.108
May I introduce Loser Mouth--?

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:07.510
Give me the-- Give me the mic--
No, no, bro.

01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:08.978
( girl gasps )

01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:11.280
Hey. Oh!

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:14.117
Whoa!

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.919
( crowd shouting indistinctly )

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:17.120
( rock music playing )

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:18.788
MAN:
* We wanna party

01:19:18.822 --> 01:19:20.023
* So get started

01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:23.126
* We wanna rock it

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.028
COOK:
Calm down.

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:26.262
( Wen grunts )

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:27.797
( girls scream )

01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:29.799
MAN:
* Go, go, go

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.069
* Go, go, go

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.403
* Yeah, yeah

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:37.540
( girls screaming )

01:19:37.573 --> 01:19:40.276
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:44.213
Ooh! Uh-oh.
CROWD: Oh!

01:19:45.849 --> 01:19:47.050
Ray is such a jerk.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.417
He got what he wanted,
didn't he?

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.219
Dante's not gonna let us
play there anymore,

01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:51.420
that's for sure.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.824
( coughing )

01:19:54.858 --> 01:19:56.559
You sure you're okay?

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:59.495
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a
little bit tired, that's all.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.064
Wait, wait, Mo.

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:06.469
There's, um,
something I need to tell you.

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:10.573
For a long time, I've wanted to
tell you, just, you were--

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:14.944
You were with Scott,
and then we became friends...

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:20.349
I like you, Mo.
There, I said it.

01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:26.189
We're just friends, Charlie.
Good friends. That's all.

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:28.357
Fine.
Charlie, please, just--

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:30.359
No, you know what?

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:34.530
"Be heard"?
It's a stupid song.

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:36.365
What?
I'm never singing it again.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:40.036
No, Charlie, no.
Don't go.

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:42.405
It's time to come in, Monu.

01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:50.479
You are too young
for boys.

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:53.016
Charlie is just a friend,
Baba.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.651
I didn't come to this country
and make the sacrifices I made

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:59.122
just so that you can
throw it all away on boys.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:00.623
And rock bands.

01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:03.859
Charlie is just a friend,
okay?

01:21:05.128 --> 01:21:07.030
And the band?

01:21:11.134 --> 01:21:14.237
It's nothing. It's just
a bit of fun, that's all.

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.404
What's going on?

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:19.442
Baba doesn't trust me.

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.345
MRS. BANJAREE:
We do trust you, Monu.

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:25.881
Do you?

01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:33.923
That's what I thought.

01:21:33.957 --> 01:21:35.658
Mohini?

01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:37.994
Hey.

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:40.529
You're burning up.

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:43.532
Let's get you to bed.

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:46.602
( drumming )

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:56.679
( drumstick clattering )

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:59.315
( sighing )

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.388
Ow!

01:22:08.992 --> 01:22:10.459
Ow.

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:13.029
MR. GIFFORD:
A little to the right.
Right, no, left.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.098
There. Good.
Unh.

01:22:15.131 --> 01:22:18.167
Yeah. Thanks for helping.
It'll mean a lot to Sydney.

01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:20.436
You got it.
So, Wen,

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:22.972
Yeah?
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.941
Will you be my best man?

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:28.444
Your what?

01:22:28.477 --> 01:22:31.047
( yelling )

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.617
Wen, you okay?
Let me see.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:36.519
Mo has
a hundred-and-two fever,

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:39.188
Charlie has
three broken fingers.

01:22:39.222 --> 01:22:41.190
Tomorrow's gonna
be a disaster.

01:22:41.224 --> 01:22:43.126
Well, we'll just call
and back out.

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:44.493
No. Back out
of Rising Star?

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:46.229
Out of everything
we've been through?

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:47.363
Whoa.

01:22:48.364 --> 01:22:50.066
You okay?

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:52.068
Yeah. Yeah, I just--

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:54.470
I just get blurry vision
sometimes.

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:56.472
What do you mean?

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:59.508
Oh. Wow.
Yeah.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.745
Doctor said it should
be gone in a couple days.

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:04.380
What happened?

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:07.416
Sydney.
Sydney did it?

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.753
Well, Sydney's picture.
I was helping my dad hang it up,

01:23:10.786 --> 01:23:13.789
and then he asked me
to be his best man.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.492
Wen, that's great news.

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:19.362
No. Okay, that's terrible news.
Oh.

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:22.365
All right, just because Sydney
wormed her way into my family

01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:24.133
doesn't mean
I have to be happy about it.

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:28.037
You're--
You're ridiculous.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.708
Wen. Wait,
where are you going?

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.244
Hey, we have to talk
about tomorrow.

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:36.812
What's to talk about?

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.182
Okay, we can't play.
So we're out.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:42.185
You know, maybe...

01:23:42.218 --> 01:23:43.452
Maybe this is a sign.

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:46.689
Maybe it's time
to call it quits.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.392
What, so you just wanna
give up?

01:23:49.425 --> 01:23:51.060
You just be happy
that you're off the hook

01:23:51.094 --> 01:23:52.561
and don't have to
go on-stage anymore.

01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:55.198
No, no. Wen, this isn't
about Lemonade Mouth.

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:58.534
This is about you not
appreciating what you have.

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:02.405
You have a family.
Your dad, your sister, Sydney.

01:24:02.438 --> 01:24:04.073
I don't even remember my mom.

01:24:04.107 --> 01:24:05.541
I haven't talked to my dad
in years,

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.476
and you have the nerve
to feel sorry for yourself?

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:11.280
Well, okay, no, fine. Go ahead,
give up. See if care.

01:24:11.314 --> 01:24:12.548
I didn't even wanna be
in this band

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:13.749
in the first place.

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.184
Well, then why did you do it?

01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:17.120
Oh, for you, you jerk!

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:21.290
( Olivia coughs then sighs )

01:24:21.324 --> 01:24:23.826
I did it for you.

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:25.761
( Olivia coughing )

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:32.401
( rock theme playing )

01:24:41.144 --> 01:24:42.678
( dialing )

01:24:44.247 --> 01:24:46.315
Hey, it's me.

01:24:46.349 --> 01:24:49.452
We have an emergency.

01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:51.720
I'm right in front
of the school.

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:53.356
Yeah, yeah. Hurry.

01:24:53.389 --> 01:24:54.523
( Mo coughing )

01:24:54.557 --> 01:24:55.724
Anybody know
what this is about?

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.393
( in hoarse voice ):
Where is she?

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:59.195
What happened
to your voice?

01:24:59.228 --> 01:25:00.496
There she is.

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:03.098
( Mo coughing )

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:07.370
What happened?
MO: Achoo.

01:25:07.403 --> 01:25:10.139
STELLA:
Did you all get hit by a bus
or something?

01:25:10.173 --> 01:25:12.641
Look who's talking.
What's going on, Stella?

01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:14.643
Yeah. What are
you doing?

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:17.513
I am protesting the removal

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:19.815
of our Mel's Lemonade
machine. Hmm.

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.384
( scoffs )

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:23.486
You're kidding me, right?
In this weather?

01:25:23.519 --> 01:25:25.654
MAN:
Okay, kid,
enough playing around.

01:25:25.688 --> 01:25:28.257
I got three more pickups today.

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:29.892
It's gonna rain.
Let's get out of here.

01:25:29.925 --> 01:25:32.495
Are you really willing
to support

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:33.596
( thunder rumbling )

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:34.897
the rampant tyranny
and oppression

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.432
of the powerful
over the voiceless?

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.800
BOTH:
Aw.

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:39.802
You move, or I move you.
It's your choice.

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:41.637
Humph.

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:47.543
I am not moving until you put
our lemonade machine back.

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.778
Have it your way, kid.
All right.

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:51.647
Hey, no.
OLIVIA: Hey. Hey, put her down.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.849
Get off of my friend!
MAN: Hey.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.784
MO:
Stop!

01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:58.821
( siren wailing )

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:04.260
OLIVIA:
Needless to say,

01:26:04.293 --> 01:26:07.530
that day was a bit of a low
for the band.

01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:09.498
( Mo coughing )

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.202
So much
for Rising Star.

01:26:13.236 --> 01:26:15.404
We can't skip it.

01:26:15.438 --> 01:26:18.274
Well, we can't play.

01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:19.875
It's over.

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.644
Wen's right.

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.580
We lose.

01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:31.320
So we lose.
So what?

01:26:32.855 --> 01:26:35.724
Lemonade Mouth
is bigger than a competition.

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:38.894
We did it to be heard.

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:43.732
For our fans, for ourselves.

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:47.236
For our friendship.
Thank you.

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:49.438
Guys, we can't give up.

01:26:49.472 --> 01:26:52.708
Olivia, this isn't just
humiliating ourselves

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:54.243
on, like, a high-school level.

01:26:54.277 --> 01:26:56.812
Look, we're not doing it.
Agreed.

01:26:58.347 --> 01:26:59.715
In case you haven't noticed,
Stella,

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:02.385
we're in a holding cell.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:04.987
Okay, and you're
the only one to blame.

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:07.256
Me?
Yeah, you.

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:09.425
Yeah, it's pretty much
all your fault, Stella.

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:10.859
( scoffs )

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:14.730
We didn't actually get arrested.

01:27:14.763 --> 01:27:16.332
Okay? We're waiting for

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:17.600
our parents
to come pick us up.

01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:20.769
Oh. Great.
Our parents.

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:22.671
Guys, can you please
stop fighting?

01:27:22.705 --> 01:27:24.373
( whispers ):
Stupid...

01:27:30.379 --> 01:27:32.381
( clinking )

01:27:34.317 --> 01:27:37.320
( twanging )

01:27:39.522 --> 01:27:42.525
( clanking )

01:27:44.527 --> 01:27:47.530
( zipping )

01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:54.903
( Mo humming
"Turn up the Music" )

01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:57.573
( Stella humming
"Turn up the Music" )

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.942
MO:
* It would be there
Just like that *

01:27:59.975 --> 01:28:03.078
* No matter what
We'll still be singing *

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.781
MO & STELLA:
* Come on, come on
Turn up the music *

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:07.316
* It's all we got
We're gonna use it *

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:08.917
( Wen beatboxing )

01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:10.786
MO:
* Come on, come on
Turn up the music *

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:13.589
Are we in?
WEN: Ha, ha. This is crazy.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.057
( all laughing )

01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:16.792
MO:
Boys.

01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:19.795
WEN: Oh, watch my eye. Ow. Oh.
OLIVIA: I know. Sorry.

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:21.397
We sent two cars out there
now...

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:22.931
( policemen speaking
indistinctly )

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:25.401
Oh, darling.

01:28:25.434 --> 01:28:27.470
When I said get out
of the house,

01:28:27.503 --> 01:28:29.805
this isn't what I meant.
Ha, ha.

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:33.842
Gram.
Oh, my sweetheart. Oh.

01:28:38.714 --> 01:28:41.484
Wen, your dad,
he's stuck in town at work.

01:28:41.517 --> 01:28:44.319
He's on his way.
I just thought I'd come and--

01:28:45.588 --> 01:28:47.556
( Sydney gasps )

01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:49.892
Thanks for coming.
Absolutely.

01:28:54.129 --> 01:28:55.464
( Mo gasps )

01:28:59.602 --> 01:29:01.904
Okay, look, I know you're
disappointed in me, but I just--

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:03.706
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's go.

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:06.008
No, Baba, please.

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:08.343
I need to say this.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.983
Look, I'm never gonna be

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:19.054
this perfect Indian daughter
you want me to be.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:22.591
I'm never gonna be just
a regular American teenager.

01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:25.661
I guess I don't know
what I am exactly,

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:27.496
maybe a little bit of both?

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:30.933
But what I'm trying
to say is,

01:29:33.068 --> 01:29:35.738
I'm finding my way.

01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:38.040
And, yeah,
I'll make mistakes.

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:42.911
But I deserve for you
to just let me be me.

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:49.384
Could you at least
try, Baba?

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:56.592
But you're still in trouble.

01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:00.095
I know.

01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:03.666
Ahh. Here we go.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:06.769
( Charlie laughs )

01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:08.537
Tommy?

01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:11.640
( sighs )

01:30:11.674 --> 01:30:13.976
You're lucky I picked up
the phone instead of Mom.

01:30:14.009 --> 01:30:15.778
Tell me about it.

01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:17.179
Here's the thing,
Charlie.

01:30:17.212 --> 01:30:18.981
You wanna play music,

01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:21.650
you need to stand up to Mom
and Dad and tell them that.

01:30:21.684 --> 01:30:23.786
Tell them
soccer isn't for you.

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:28.924
That you wanna go to music
school, not Stanford.

01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:31.527
That's easy for you to say.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.596
They think everything you do
is perfect.

01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:35.698
Yeah, well, they're
not thinking that for long.

01:30:37.733 --> 01:30:41.537
My grades this semester?
Not so hot.

01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:42.938
( scoffs )

01:30:42.971 --> 01:30:45.541
So much for that whole
"perfect" thing, huh?

01:30:45.574 --> 01:30:48.544
Here's an idea.

01:30:48.577 --> 01:30:51.747
What do you say we go
tell Mom and Dad together?

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:05.861
( sighs )

01:31:14.036 --> 01:31:15.871
Yeah, I know.

01:31:17.873 --> 01:31:20.843
Grounded for life.

01:31:20.876 --> 01:31:24.479
You got off with a warning.
Let's just leave it at that.

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:30.853
Do you know what I see
when I look at you, Stella?

01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:37.593
I see the most determined,
focused girl I've ever known.

01:31:37.626 --> 01:31:41.196
I mean, look at what
you've done. You started a band.

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:44.733
You stood up for what you
believed in.

01:31:44.767 --> 01:31:49.037
I'm sorry that I've been
so distracted lately.

01:31:49.071 --> 01:31:51.574
But, Stell,

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:57.179
I couldn't be any prouder
of what I see.

01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:00.783
Really?

01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:10.893
Thanks, Mom.
Hey, let's get out of here.

01:32:10.926 --> 01:32:12.060
Okay.

01:32:15.063 --> 01:32:17.199
Hey.

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:19.167
You wanna come see
our revolution?

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:22.337
MRS. YAMADA:
We were planning on it.

They need help, man.

No, no. You do that, man,

We didn't win Rising Star,

01:38:13.555 --> 01:38:17.325

01:38:27.435 --> 01:38:29.938
Hey.
Hey.

01:38:31.173 --> 01:38:32.574
Thank you
for helping us out.

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:36.211
It's the least I could do.

01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:46.955
So this package deal
that you were talking about?

01:38:46.989 --> 01:38:49.591
You and your music?
Yeah?

01:38:49.624 --> 01:38:51.459
Well, it sounds pretty good.

01:38:53.061 --> 01:38:56.564
And if you, um--
If you could give me a chance,

01:38:56.598 --> 01:38:59.501
I'd really like to get to know
this Mohini.

01:39:01.736 --> 01:39:03.571
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:39:03.605 --> 01:39:05.340
I'd like that.

01:39:11.613 --> 01:39:14.616

What's up?

01:39:42.244 --> 01:39:45.147
I brought you something.

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:49.351
What is it?
Oh, my goodness.

01:39:49.384 --> 01:39:52.487
Oh, the little kitty.
Where did you get her?

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.757
One of Sydney's old roommates
found a whole litter,

01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:58.493
and, uh, I thought of you.

01:39:58.526 --> 01:40:00.762
Oh, she's adorable.

01:40:00.795 --> 01:40:02.097

Hi. Hi.

01:40:04.799 --> 01:40:06.268
You were right, you know.

01:40:07.402 --> 01:40:09.104
About Sydney.

01:40:09.137 --> 01:40:15.243
You know, she may not be my mom,
but she definitely cares.

01:40:15.277 --> 01:40:20.782
I mean, it's not perfect,
but it's okay.

01:40:20.815 --> 01:40:25.253
Yeah, well, perfect, Wen?
Way overrated.

01:40:25.287 --> 01:40:26.721
Come here.

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:30.825
Thank you.
Thank you.

For a long time there has been
an empty spot

01:40:34.429 --> 01:40:37.532
in my life and in my heart.

01:40:37.565 --> 01:40:41.203
And meeting you has brought joy
back into my life.

01:40:41.236 --> 01:40:43.671
OLIVIA:
In life, and in music,

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:45.407
things have a funny way
of turning out

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.842
exactly the way
they're supposed to.

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:54.349
--will make Wen and Georgie
and I happy and complete

01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:56.384
for the rest of our lives.

01:40:57.719 --> 01:40:59.687
That's my band mate
up there.

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:01.423
And that's
my old college buddy.

01:41:01.456 --> 01:41:03.091
Huh.

01:41:03.125 --> 01:41:04.292
See, you and me,
we're, like,

01:41:04.326 --> 01:41:05.693
practically best friends
already.

01:41:05.727 --> 01:41:07.762
( chuckles )

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:09.497
You know, I used to be
in a band too.

01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:11.733
Really?

01:41:11.766 --> 01:41:14.369
Yeah. Played bass.

01:41:14.402 --> 01:41:15.603
What do you do now?

01:41:15.637 --> 01:41:18.706
Now I own
an organic lemonade company.

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.575
Thing is going gangbusters.
It's crazy.

01:41:20.608 --> 01:41:22.544
People just can't get enough
of the stuff.

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:28.850
Mel?
Yeah.

01:41:28.883 --> 01:41:31.386
( upbeat theme playing )

01:41:34.689 --> 01:41:36.491
Let me ask
you something, Mel.

01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:38.593
( coins clinking )

01:41:38.626 --> 01:41:41.129
OLIVIA:
Sometimes, risking it all
to have your voice heard

01:41:41.163 --> 01:41:43.731
pays off in ways
you never imagined.

01:41:43.765 --> 01:41:46.368
Mel understood this,
and was more than happy

01:41:46.401 --> 01:41:47.735
to help us build a place

01:41:47.769 --> 01:41:50.205
where all our voices
could be heard.

01:41:50.238 --> 01:41:51.639
Outside of the basement.

01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:53.375
STELLA:
Congratulations, Miss Reznick.

01:41:53.408 --> 01:41:56.678
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:41:56.711 --> 01:42:00.482
All right. Let's open up
our music hall.

01:42:00.515 --> 01:42:02.484
One second, Jenny.
REZNICK: We are officially--

01:42:02.517 --> 01:42:03.885
Photo op for the papers
right here.

01:42:03.918 --> 01:42:05.353
REZNICK:
Okay.

01:42:05.387 --> 01:42:07.555
Here we are.
We are open.

01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:08.756
BRENIGAN:
Yeah!

01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:10.592
( crowd cheering )

01:42:10.625 --> 01:42:12.894
Who would have thought? Stella.

01:42:12.927 --> 01:42:14.762
Stella did all of this.

01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:17.299
Hey, you guys. Cheers.

01:42:17.332 --> 01:42:18.900
BAND: Cheers.

01:42:18.933 --> 01:42:21.269
OLIVIA: Oh! Ha, ha.
BRENIGAN: Cheers.

01:42:21.303 --> 01:42:22.704
( all laugh )

01:42:22.737 --> 01:42:25.307
To music.
To music.

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.675
You know, she'd actually make
a very good principal one day.

01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:29.177
What?

01:42:29.211 --> 01:42:30.778
Well, I used to be a bit
of a rebel myself,

01:42:30.812 --> 01:42:31.813
back in the day.

01:42:31.846 --> 01:42:33.315
( sniffs )

01:42:33.348 --> 01:42:34.649
Really?
Yeah.

01:42:34.682 --> 01:42:36.651
Oh. Hee-hee.
Stanley.

01:42:36.684 --> 01:42:38.320

01:42:39.821 --> 01:42:42.457
BAND ( in unison ):
Lemonade Mouth! Whoo!

01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:46.861
OLIVIA:
And that, Dad, is how
Lemonade Mouth came to be.

01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:50.365
God, I can't wait to tell you
the rest in person.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.802
I really miss you, Dad.

01:42:54.836 --> 01:42:58.172
Love, Olivia.

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:03.845
( dramatic theme playing )

01:43:03.878 --> 01:43:05.980
OLIVIA:
Oh, I almost forgot, Dad.

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:09.417
You're never gonna believe
where we're playing next week.

01:43:09.451 --> 01:43:11.819
( crowd cheering )

01:43:11.853 --> 01:43:14.822

01:43:14.856 --> 01:43:18.192

I just hope our new guitar
player can keep up.

01:43:23.865 --> 01:43:25.967

Falling to the ground *

* Sometimes dreams can feel
So far away *

01:43:37.612 --> 01:43:39.714
* Time keeps skipping
Out of beat *

01:43:39.747 --> 01:43:41.749
* Left, right
Tripping on your feet *

01:43:41.783 --> 01:43:43.785

Of cloudy days *

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:45.453
WEN:
Here we go.

01:43:45.487 --> 01:43:47.589
* Sometimes it's raising
Your voice *

01:43:47.622 --> 01:43:49.591
* Sometimes it's making
Some noise *

01:43:49.624 --> 01:43:53.661
* Sometimes it's proving
To the world it was wrong *

01:43:53.695 --> 01:43:55.930
* Whenever you can't see
The light *

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:58.866

Moving to the left *

In your way *

01:44:37.539 --> 01:44:39.807
* Heartbreak, pick up
All the pieces *

01:44:39.841 --> 01:44:41.776

In the bleachers *

01:44:41.809 --> 01:44:43.778

Welcome to The Music Scene.
I'm Moxie Morris,

01:47:42.857 --> 01:47:45.126
your host for all things
musical.

01:47:45.159 --> 01:47:46.761
And do we have a treat
for you tonight.

01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:50.732
Here in the studio with us
we have Lemonade Mouth.

01:47:50.765 --> 01:47:52.099
Let's give it up.
WEN: What's up?

01:47:52.133 --> 01:47:54.035
Thanks for coming, guys.

01:47:54.068 --> 01:47:56.838
WEN: Oh, no problem.
Yeah.

01:47:56.871 --> 01:47:58.740
So eight months ago,

01:47:58.773 --> 01:48:02.510
you were all just normal
high school students,

01:48:02.544 --> 01:48:05.279
and now, here you are,
at the top of the charts.

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:07.882
How did you get here?

01:48:10.017 --> 01:48:11.853
Nobody?
Well, we're--

01:48:11.886 --> 01:48:14.255
We're just saving that
for the movie.

01:48:14.288 --> 01:48:16.858
MOXIE:
Oh, come on. I mean, you guys,
tell me a little bit

01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:18.860
about how life
has changed for all of you.

01:48:18.893 --> 01:48:22.530
I mean, Charlie,
you're America's new heartthrob.

01:48:22.564 --> 01:48:23.998
Charlie.
Yeah.

01:48:24.031 --> 01:48:25.800
Is there anyone special
in your life?

01:48:25.833 --> 01:48:27.201
OLIVIA:
Charlie.

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:29.871
Um... No.

01:48:29.904 --> 01:48:33.174
No one--
No one special.

01:48:33.207 --> 01:48:35.176
Not yet, anyway.

01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:38.880
Well, speaking of someone
special, Scott and Mohini,

01:48:38.913 --> 01:48:41.282
how is your relationship
holding up

01:48:41.315 --> 01:48:43.818
under all
this new pressure?

01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:46.187
BABA:
Relationship? Mohini?

01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:47.955
What relationship?

01:48:47.989 --> 01:48:49.891
( whispering ):
We talked about this, Baba.

01:48:49.924 --> 01:48:51.693
BABA:
We didn't talk
about a relationship.

01:48:51.726 --> 01:48:54.829
No. No, actually,
it's not Mo, it's me.

01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:56.764
WEN:
What?

01:48:56.798 --> 01:48:59.266
( audience members whistle
and chatter )

01:49:01.202 --> 01:49:03.137
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

01:49:04.806 --> 01:49:06.974
Oh! No, no, no.
I-- I mean, me and Wen.

01:49:07.008 --> 01:49:11.145
We've-- We've, um--
We've been dating-ish, I guess.

01:49:11.178 --> 01:49:14.215
Haven't--? I mean,
we have, haven't-- Haven't we?

01:49:14.248 --> 01:49:16.083
I mean...

01:49:16.117 --> 01:49:18.853
I mean, I think we have,
haven't we, sort of? I mean--

01:49:18.886 --> 01:49:20.888
Or not. It's okay.
Or not.

01:49:22.824 --> 01:49:25.259
Oh, no, no. Yeah, yeah. We--

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:27.061
She-- She's my girl.

01:49:27.094 --> 01:49:30.665
( audience applauding )

01:49:30.698 --> 01:49:33.200
MOXIE:
Looks like love is in bloom
for Lemonade Mouth.

01:49:33.234 --> 01:49:36.704
Okay. Here's the deal, Moxie.

01:49:36.738 --> 01:49:41.743
Life for us, it's different,
but, uh, it's still the same.

01:49:41.776 --> 01:49:46.981
I mean, the stage is bigger
and the crowd is way louder,

01:49:47.014 --> 01:49:52.286
but every night we get out
there, we know where we belong.

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.055
And where is that?

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:58.893
Together.
Making music we love.

01:49:58.926 --> 01:50:00.628
Yes.

01:50:00.662 --> 01:50:02.163
Now, uh, if you don't mind,

01:50:02.196 --> 01:50:04.131
I think we'd really love
to play our new song.

01:50:04.165 --> 01:50:05.900
( audience cheering )
MOXIE: Absolutely.

01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:07.769
And we'd love
to hear it.

01:50:07.802 --> 01:50:10.237
Let you set up.
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:14.175
what a treat. Here, with their
new song "High Wire,"

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:16.010
Lemonade Mouth.

01:50:16.043 --> 01:50:18.713
( playing upbeat pop music )

01:50:18.746 --> 01:50:21.248
WEN:
Listen up.

01:50:21.282 --> 01:50:24.318
* This the story on how we live
The glory of what we did *

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:26.020
* It started when we were kids

01:50:26.053 --> 01:50:27.855
* With music up in our heads
She said *

01:50:27.889 --> 01:50:30.324
* I've been
Out on the edge *

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:33.127
* Breathin' a little
Bit of fresh air *

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.030
* Big dreams
I took a chance *

01:50:36.063 --> 01:50:39.000
* Held out for everything
I got here *

01:50:39.033 --> 01:50:42.870
* I've been feelin'
This life's a circus *

01:50:42.904 --> 01:50:44.906
* Hangin' on without a fear

01:50:47.308 --> 01:50:49.744
* Livin' on a high wire
Runnin' through a wildfire *

01:50:49.777 --> 01:50:52.947
* You can't shake me
I'm not goin' nowhere *

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.817
* Walkin' on a tightrope
No net, high hopes *

01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:58.820
* Step back
I'm gonna make it over *

01:50:58.853 --> 01:51:01.355
* Na, na, na-na-na, na, na

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:04.091
* Na, na
Livin' on a high wire *

01:51:04.125 --> 01:51:07.328
* Na, na, na-na-na, na, na

01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:09.897
* Na, na
Livin' on a high wire *

01:51:09.931 --> 01:51:12.299
* This the story on how we live
The glory of what we did *

01:51:12.333 --> 01:51:13.968
* It started
When we were kids *

01:51:14.001 --> 01:51:16.037
* With music up in our heads
She said *

01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:18.372
* Big top turnin' around

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:19.941
* No clowns

01:51:19.974 --> 01:51:21.308
* I'm runnin'
As I hit the ground *

01:51:21.342 --> 01:51:24.045
* Front row
Big show is sold out *

01:51:24.078 --> 01:51:27.048
* So I'm ready for
The crowd roar, let's go *

01:51:27.081 --> 01:51:30.952
* I've been feelin'
This life's a circus *

01:51:30.985 --> 01:51:33.187
* Hangin' on without a fear

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.189
* Yeah

01:51:35.222 --> 01:51:37.959
* Livin' on a high wire
Runnin' through a wildfire *

01:51:37.992 --> 01:51:40.862
* You can't shake me
I'm not goin' nowhere *

01:51:40.895 --> 01:51:43.931
* Walkin' on a tightrope
No net, high hopes *

01:51:43.965 --> 01:51:46.934
* Step back
I'm gonna make it over *

01:51:46.968 --> 01:51:49.804
* Na, na, na-na-na, na, na

01:51:49.837 --> 01:51:52.473
* Na, na
Livin' on a high wire *

01:51:52.506 --> 01:51:55.109
* Na, na, na-na-na, na, na

01:51:55.142 --> 01:51:57.344
* Na, na
Livin' on the high wire *

01:51:57.378 --> 01:51:59.013
* Gettin' used
To the beat *

01:51:59.046 --> 01:52:00.347
* Seein' that the heads
Are movin' *

01:52:00.381 --> 01:52:02.083
* Move off your seat

01:52:02.116 --> 01:52:03.851
* Achievin's what
We really doin' *

01:52:03.885 --> 01:52:05.887
* Freedom of speech
I'm in it just to win it *

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:07.221
* I'm sprintin'
And I can see it in me *

01:52:07.254 --> 01:52:09.156
* And that you can be it

01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:11.826
* 'Cause it's patience
Statements, famous, greatness *

01:52:11.859 --> 01:52:13.127
* Move until
You make it through *

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.962
* And, baby
You can make it too *

01:52:14.996 --> 01:52:17.098
* Livin' on a high wire

01:52:17.131 --> 01:52:20.301

WEN:

01:52:39.186 --> 01:52:41.989

( audience cheering )

01:52:51.198 --> 01:52:53.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
once again,

01:52:53.334 --> 01:52:57.404
give it up for Lemonade Mouth.
This is why they're number one.

01:52:57.438 --> 01:53:00.207
Thank you. Thank you so much
for coming on the show.

01:53:00.241 --> 01:53:02.476
Wow. Wow.

01:53:02.509 --> 01:53:04.478
Bye.
