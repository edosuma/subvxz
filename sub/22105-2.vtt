<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.280 --> 00:05.250
<i>and I graduated from one of Canada's
top business schools</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.250
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.760 --> 00:11.310
<i>Now, I'm using my knowledge
to help struggling small business owners</i>

00:11.310 --> 00:13.310

This is <i> Nathan for you.</i>

00:25.255 --> 00:28.291
<i>Over 10 million tourists
visit Hollywood each year,</i>

00:28.342 --> 00:31.043
<i>And souvenir shops compete hard
to sell them items</i>

00:31.045 --> 00:33.713
<i>that most would consider
embarrassing to own.</i>

00:33.715 --> 00:36.799
<i>But in the souvenir game,
location is everything.</i>

00:36.850 --> 00:38.968
<i>And that's why,
tucked away nearly five blocks</i>

00:39.019 --> 00:42.555
<i>from the Main Strip,
L.A. Fame is struggling.</i>

00:42.606 --> 00:45.274
<i>It's a sad tale,
and with business this slow,</i>

00:45.309 --> 00:48.694
<i>Owner John Kim has a tough time
finding things to boast about.</i>

00:48.729 --> 00:51.530
Recently, we had someone
from of Mice & Men come in--

00:51.565 --> 00:53.616
From the--
They're a rock band

00:53.650 --> 00:55.902
that's pretty popular right now.

00:55.904 --> 00:57.787
But other than that, you know...

00:57.821 --> 01:00.573
So I paid John a visit
to see if I could help.

01:00.575 --> 01:02.408
Why are you wearing a touk?

01:02.459 --> 01:03.659
A touk?
What--

01:03.710 --> 01:05.126
- This.
- Oh.

01:05.162 --> 01:06.162
What do you call it?

01:06.213 --> 01:07.413
It's a beanie.
So that's--

01:07.415 --> 01:09.415
I'm from Canada.
We call it a "touk."

01:09.466 --> 01:10.633
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10.667 --> 01:11.834
- Yeah, I'm just cold right now.

01:11.885 --> 01:12.835
That's why I'm wearing it.

01:12.886 --> 01:13.836
Oh, okay.

01:13.887 --> 01:15.087
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:15.138 --> 01:16.589
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.092
<i>My mission was to attract
more tourists to L.A. Fame.</i>

01:20.094 --> 01:22.678
<i>If you're visiting Hollywood,
there's nothing more exciting</i>

01:22.729 --> 01:25.181
<i>than seeing the magic
of the movies up close,</i>

01:25.232 --> 01:26.983
<i>so if John redesigned
his storefront</i>

01:27.017 --> 01:28.985
<i>to make it look
like a blockbuster movie</i>

01:29.019 --> 01:30.736
<i>was always being shot there,</i>

01:30.771 --> 01:33.489
<i>every tourist on the Strip
would flock to L.A. Fame</i>

01:33.523 --> 01:35.408
<i>to see the action up close.</i>

01:35.442 --> 01:37.610
<i>Then all I need to do
is offer each tourist</i>

01:37.612 --> 01:38.911
<i>a part in the movie.</i>

01:38.946 --> 01:39.996
<i>Their role?</i>

01:40.030 --> 01:42.748
<i>A paying customer
at a souvenir shop.</i>

01:42.783 --> 01:45.451
Okay.
Okay.

01:45.453 --> 01:46.919
- Tourists get very excited...
- Yeah.

01:46.954 --> 01:49.789
around celebrities
and movie sets,

01:49.840 --> 01:51.257
so they wouldn't think
rationally.

01:51.291 --> 01:52.258
Yeah.

01:52.292 --> 01:53.426
Once you have the crowd here,

01:53.460 --> 01:56.595
it becomes very easy
to sell to them.

01:56.630 --> 01:57.964
Yeah, maybe.

01:57.966 --> 02:00.433
<i>John was onboard,
so to make L.A. Fame</i>

02:00.467 --> 02:03.219
<i>look as much like
a real movie set as possible,</i>

02:03.270 --> 02:04.804
<i>I rented some lights
and equipment</i>

02:04.806 --> 02:07.139
<i>and set them up
outside of his shop.</i>

02:07.141 --> 02:09.892
<i>Next, to make the movie
truly exciting for tourists,</i>

02:09.943 --> 02:12.278
<i>I hired professional
Johnny Depp impersonator</i>

02:12.312 --> 02:15.281
<i>Ronnie Rodriguez, who I hoped
would convincingly pass</i>

02:15.315 --> 02:16.983
<i>for the real Johnny
from a distance.</i>

02:17.034 --> 02:19.652
<i>I also hired a worse
Johnny Depp impersonator</i>

02:19.703 --> 02:21.237
<i>to act as a stand-in</i>

02:21.288 --> 02:23.990
<i>and make Ronnie look better
by comparison.</i>

02:24.041 --> 02:25.374
<i>With everything in place,</i>

02:25.409 --> 02:26.459
<i>the fake movie shoot began.</i>

02:26.493 --> 02:27.660
Action.

02:27.662 --> 02:29.078
<i>As I pretended to direct,</i>

02:29.129 --> 02:31.213
<i>tourists slowly began to gather.</i>

02:31.248 --> 02:32.248
Cut.

02:32.299 --> 02:33.416
Let's do another take of that.

02:33.467 --> 02:34.800
That was really good, guys.

02:34.835 --> 02:37.553
<i>And excitement was building
around our celebrity star.</i>

02:39.256 --> 02:42.308
Yeah, it's amazing.
Yeah.

02:47.347 --> 02:49.148
<i>And once we gave them
a tiny peek of Johnny...</i>

02:49.182 --> 02:50.266
Whoo-hoo, Johnny.

02:50.317 --> 02:52.268
<i>they were putty in my hands,</i>

02:52.319 --> 02:54.487
<i>and it was time
to sell some souvenirs.</i>

02:54.521 --> 02:55.821
Hi, everyone.

02:55.856 --> 02:57.573
So as you can see,
we're filming a movie here.

02:57.607 --> 02:59.241
It's called <i>The Web.</i>

02:59.276 --> 03:01.861
It's about a hacker,
played by Johnny Depp,

03:01.912 --> 03:04.363
who has to hack
into an asteroid

03:04.414 --> 03:06.082
to stop it
from hitting the Earth.

03:06.116 --> 03:07.333
Okay.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.085
So this is
a little bit unorthodox,

03:09.119 --> 03:11.287
but we need some extras
to be in the scene.

03:11.338 --> 03:12.838
I don't know-- Is that okay?
Is anyone interested?

03:12.873 --> 03:14.173
Right here.

03:14.207 --> 03:15.424
Really?
Oh, wow.

03:15.459 --> 03:16.876
<i>With no shortage of volunteers,</i>

03:16.927 --> 03:18.177
<i>I had them brought to set</i>

03:18.211 --> 03:19.845
<i>one at a time
to give them their direction.</i>

03:19.880 --> 03:21.013
Let me just explain to you
what you have to do.

03:21.048 --> 03:22.014
Okay.

03:22.049 --> 03:24.050
Go into the store,

03:24.101 --> 03:25.134
buy an item, and then leave.

03:25.185 --> 03:26.602
Okay, cool.

03:26.636 --> 03:27.770
Okay, so, on action.
Ready?

03:27.804 --> 03:31.474
- Yes.
- Action.

03:31.525 --> 03:33.109
You don't have to go so fast,
sir.

03:33.143 --> 03:34.393
- You can slow down.
- Okay.

03:34.444 --> 03:36.645
It might not have been
an Oscar-worthy performance...

03:36.696 --> 03:37.897
$6.53.

03:37.899 --> 03:39.815
<i>But our first customer
of the day left happy.</i>

03:39.866 --> 03:41.283
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

03:41.318 --> 03:42.284
Have a nice day.

03:42.319 --> 03:43.536
<i>I gave each extra some direction</i>

03:43.570 --> 03:44.537
<i>and let them run with it.</i>

03:44.571 --> 03:46.872
So I need you to go in there,

03:46.907 --> 03:48.407
pick out an item, buy it,
and then leave.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.076
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:50.127 --> 03:51.410
Okay,
so I need you to go in there,

03:51.412 --> 03:53.412
buy something, then leave.

03:53.414 --> 03:54.413
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:54.415 --> 03:55.714
<i>My plan was working beautifully,</i>

03:55.749 --> 03:58.667
<i>as tourists were buying items
in a steady stream.</i>

03:58.718 --> 04:01.420
<i>The scene was fake,
but these sales were real,</i>

04:01.422 --> 04:03.589
<i>and customers were thrilled
with their purchases.</i>

04:03.640 --> 04:04.723
Did you pay for that?

04:04.758 --> 04:05.724
Yeah.

04:05.759 --> 04:06.725
Okay, so it's yours then.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.010
Oh.

04:08.061 --> 04:10.262
<i>But each transaction
was just for a small amount,</i>

04:10.313 --> 04:12.314
<i>so I took John's place
to show him</i>

04:12.349 --> 04:14.650
<i>how he could get customers
to spend more.</i>

04:14.684 --> 04:15.768
Oh, hello, Officer Suzanne.

04:15.819 --> 04:17.069
Hi.

04:17.103 --> 04:18.771
How's the hacker investigation
going?

04:18.822 --> 04:22.775
Um-- Wait,
what do you want me to say?

04:22.777 --> 04:24.243
Oh, just say,
"No leads yet."

04:24.277 --> 04:25.277
Okay.

04:25.279 --> 04:26.278
Go ahead.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.114
Oh, no leads yet
at all, so...

04:28.165 --> 04:29.665
- Okay.
- Mm-mm.

04:29.699 --> 04:31.667
Well, I have the stuff
you asked me to put aside.

04:31.701 --> 04:32.751
Mm-hmm.

04:32.786 --> 04:34.120
That'll be $87, please.

04:34.171 --> 04:35.454
Okay.

04:35.456 --> 04:37.623
Here we are.

04:37.674 --> 04:38.624
Oh, thank you.

04:38.675 --> 04:42.261
You're very welcome.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.298
Are you actually, like,
charging it to my card?

04:46.349 --> 04:48.467
- You're breaking character.
- Okay.

04:48.469 --> 04:49.935
- Just say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.

04:49.970 --> 04:50.970
Okay, yes.

04:50.972 --> 04:53.355
<i>$87 in a single transaction</i>

04:53.390 --> 04:55.808
<i>was unprecedented
for a souvenir shop,</i>

04:55.859 --> 04:58.777
<i>but I soon discovered
I wasn't in the clear yet.</i>

04:58.812 --> 05:01.230
So you had a question
about something or...

05:01.281 --> 05:03.949
Yeah, I mean,
I don't want this stuff, but--

05:03.984 --> 05:05.317
- Oh, do you want a refund?
- Yeah.

05:05.368 --> 05:07.703
<i>I had anticipated that people
might want their money back,</i>

05:07.737 --> 05:09.538
<i>so I came up with a plan
that would hopefully</i>

05:09.573 --> 05:10.623
<i>make them reconsider.</i>

05:10.657 --> 05:12.158
- This movie stars Johnny Depp.
- Yeah.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.709
I don't know if you knew,

05:13.743 --> 05:16.045
but he was watching
the footage...

05:16.079 --> 05:17.046
Yeah.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.047
on the monitor view,

05:18.081 --> 05:19.215
and he just thought
you were,

05:19.249 --> 05:20.466
like, the most natural actress.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.834
- Have you acted before?
- No, never.

05:21.885 --> 05:23.302
- You've never?
- Mm-mm.

05:23.336 --> 05:25.554
If you want, I might be able
to get you in there to meet him.

05:25.589 --> 05:27.339
Yeah, if he doesn't mind,
I mean...

05:27.341 --> 05:28.340
Yeah, I mean...

05:28.342 --> 05:31.010
Okay.

05:31.061 --> 05:32.094
- Johnny?
- Yes?

05:32.145 --> 05:33.095
You decent?

05:33.146 --> 05:34.346
Hey.

05:34.348 --> 05:36.182
Johnny, this is Karter,
the actress you just--

05:36.184 --> 05:37.183
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

05:37.234 --> 05:38.434
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

05:38.485 --> 05:40.019
- Nice to meet you too.
- How you doing?

05:40.070 --> 05:41.020
- I'm good.
- Wow, so...

05:41.071 --> 05:43.022
I heard you did
a good job on the scene.

05:43.024 --> 05:44.190
Oh, thank you.

05:44.241 --> 05:45.858
Are you a--
you're a fan of his, or...

05:45.909 --> 05:46.859
- Of course.
- Oh, really?

05:46.910 --> 05:47.993
Of course I am.

05:48.028 --> 05:49.411
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean,</i>
come on.

05:49.446 --> 05:50.412
Really?

05:50.447 --> 05:51.530
- Good.
- Good, it's a--

05:51.581 --> 05:52.865
- Thank you very much.
- Pleasure to meet you.

05:52.916 --> 05:55.534
Do you want him
to sign some stuff for you?

05:55.585 --> 05:56.702
Like, in here?

05:56.753 --> 05:57.703
Yeah.

05:57.754 --> 05:58.837
I mean--
Oh, wait.

05:58.872 --> 06:00.673
You did--
You wanted to return those?

06:00.707 --> 06:02.925
Oh, really?
Well--

06:02.959 --> 06:04.960
If he signs them,
we can't return them, so...

06:05.011 --> 06:08.547
Yeah, well,
if he signs one, can't you--

06:08.598 --> 06:10.132
Can you, or no?
No?

06:10.183 --> 06:11.767
He usually likes to sign
everything.

06:11.801 --> 06:12.768
I can--

06:12.802 --> 06:14.136
All right.

06:14.187 --> 06:15.354
Let me see.

06:15.388 --> 06:18.774
I can't say no
to an autograph, I mean...

06:18.808 --> 06:20.893
"To my favorite--"
Rum should probably go in here.

06:20.944 --> 06:22.528
<i>It was a tense 15 minutes</i>

06:22.562 --> 06:25.898
<i>as Ronnie signed everything
in her basket.</i>

06:25.900 --> 06:28.117
So when is this movie
supposed to be coming out?

06:28.151 --> 06:29.485
Um...

06:29.536 --> 06:31.370
<i>But in the end,
she kept all her souvenirs</i>

06:31.404 --> 06:33.155
<i>and went home happy.</i>

06:33.206 --> 06:35.241
<i>And as the day progressed,
we got better and better</i>

06:35.243 --> 06:37.826
<i>at getting customers
to make big purchases.</i>

06:37.877 --> 06:42.081
Your character is a customer
who loves to spend money.

06:42.132 --> 06:46.669
He's rich, and he loves
to just buy souvenirs.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.920
So that's your motivation.

06:47.971 --> 06:48.921
Action.

06:48.972 --> 06:49.922
And people seemed to be

06:49.973 --> 06:51.507
embracing their roles.

06:51.558 --> 06:53.342
I'm gonna give myself
an Oscar for being so rich.

06:53.393 --> 06:55.227
- How's that?
- All right.

06:55.262 --> 06:56.345
<i>Over the course of the day,</i>

06:56.396 --> 06:58.230
<i>we sold a record number
of souvenirs.</i>

06:58.265 --> 07:00.516
The total comes out
to $170.92.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.101
$170...

07:02.103 --> 07:04.103
<i>And even though the autographs
may have been fake,</i>

07:04.154 --> 07:07.323
<i>the memories these regular folks
took home that day</i>

07:07.357 --> 07:09.608
<i>would last a lifetime.</i>

07:09.659 --> 07:12.278
<i>And at the end of the day,
I wanted to see if John</i>

07:12.329 --> 07:14.280
<i>planned to keep using
my sales method.</i>

07:14.331 --> 07:16.115
Is this something you might
want to keep doing?

07:16.166 --> 07:18.083
Um...

07:18.118 --> 07:20.085
No, I mean--

07:20.120 --> 07:21.086
Maybe. Maybe, yeah.

07:21.121 --> 07:22.671
Maybe? So--
Okay.

07:22.706 --> 07:24.456
- Yeah.
- That's good.

07:24.507 --> 07:27.376
Unfortunately, Ronnie,
the Johnny Depp impersonator,

07:27.427 --> 07:29.795
has limited availability
outside of today.

07:29.846 --> 07:30.846
Right.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.215
So I found
another impersonator

07:33.266 --> 07:35.050
that could replace him,
perhaps,

07:35.101 --> 07:36.135
if you want to continue this.

07:36.186 --> 07:39.188
Okay.

07:39.222 --> 07:41.857
This is William.

07:41.891 --> 07:44.777
He's a professional
Bill Gates impersonator.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.145
Okay.

07:46.147 --> 07:49.064
Why don't you give him
a little taste of Bill?

07:49.115 --> 07:51.617
Yes, it's a pleasure
to be here.

07:51.651 --> 07:56.121
You know, when we started
our computers,

07:56.156 --> 07:59.158
um, back in the '80s,

07:59.160 --> 08:00.959
it was huge.

08:00.994 --> 08:01.960
And the business--

08:01.995 --> 08:04.330
they were huge machines.

08:04.332 --> 08:07.166
You know, we started--
I started in a garage.

08:07.168 --> 08:09.218
Okay, I think that--
yeah, that's enough probably.

08:09.252 --> 08:10.336
So, yeah,

08:10.387 --> 08:12.054
you do this for a living, right?

08:12.088 --> 08:13.255
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

08:13.306 --> 08:14.506
Yeah, well,
I'll leave you guys

08:14.508 --> 08:15.808
to work out the details,
I guess.

08:15.842 --> 08:17.343
- Okay.
- You can take it from here.

08:17.394 --> 08:18.844
But, yeah,
great to meet you.

08:18.846 --> 08:19.928
- Great to meet you.
- All right, see ya.

08:19.979 --> 08:22.231
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:22.265 --> 08:23.849
Um, I mean...

08:23.900 --> 08:27.736
Well, I hope
everybody buys Microsoft--

08:27.771 --> 08:31.190
continues--
continue the business.

08:31.241 --> 08:33.275
We can always use it,

08:33.326 --> 08:36.278
and we're so grateful that--

08:36.328 --> 08:38.364
what we have accomplished.

08:38.366 --> 08:39.365
Okay.

08:39.366 --> 08:40.366
What you--

08:44.037 --> 08:45.337
Um...

08:49.486 --> 08:51.270
I assume this goes
without saying,

08:51.272 --> 08:52.604
but in making this show,

08:52.606 --> 08:55.658
I ensure that every idea
I present to a business I help

08:55.692 --> 08:58.410
is completely, 100% legal.

08:58.445 --> 09:01.363
However, in the weeks
since helping L.A. Fame,

09:01.414 --> 09:02.915
I discovered
that certain elements

09:02.949 --> 09:04.583
of my marketing plan

09:04.617 --> 09:07.619
may have actually
constituted fraud.

09:07.671 --> 09:09.672
And that's not good.

09:09.706 --> 09:11.123
<i>When I finished up with John,</i>

09:11.174 --> 09:13.676
<i>I assumed my work
with his business was done,</i>

09:13.710 --> 09:15.294
<i>but then our production
began receiving</i>

09:15.296 --> 09:17.880
<i>several emails
from souvenir shop customers</i>

09:17.931 --> 09:20.015
<i>asking when </i> The Web <i>,
my fake movie,</i>

09:20.050 --> 09:21.800
<i>was coming out in theaters.</i>

09:21.802 --> 09:23.769
<i>Not knowing how to respond
to these emails,</i>

09:23.803 --> 09:25.938
<i>I met with
retired California state judge</i>

09:25.972 --> 09:28.774
<i>the Honorable Anthony Filosa
for some guidance.</i>

09:28.808 --> 09:29.775
It's fraud.

09:29.809 --> 09:31.477
Theft, basically.

09:31.479 --> 09:33.278
- Theft and fraud?
- Yes.

09:33.313 --> 09:35.614
What you did
was a criminal offense.

09:35.648 --> 09:37.366
It can be punished
by a misdemeanor

09:37.400 --> 09:38.484
or by a felony

09:38.486 --> 09:41.203
depending on the amount
of money involved.

09:41.237 --> 09:42.821
You're admitting to me
that--

09:42.872 --> 09:44.323
No, I didn't admit anything.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.241
Well, you said
that you did not intend

09:46.292 --> 09:47.993
to make a movie.

09:47.995 --> 09:49.578
So how do I get out of this?

09:49.629 --> 09:50.713
You have two options.

09:50.747 --> 09:54.133
You could make an offer
to refund the money.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.467
That would be one way.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.920
Or, of course,
actually make the film.

09:57.971 --> 10:00.806
So if <i> The Web</i>
were a real movie,

10:00.840 --> 10:02.424
then I would be covered?

10:02.475 --> 10:03.976
Yes. Yes.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.260
<i>Judge Filosa had given me</i>

10:05.311 --> 10:07.179
<i>a great way
to beat a fraud charge.</i>

10:07.230 --> 10:10.599
<i>I'd edit the footage we shot
at L.A. Fame into a movie,</i>

10:10.650 --> 10:12.518
<i>but this task
proved to be difficult.</i>

10:12.569 --> 10:15.854
<i>It was all just random scenes
with customers, no story.</i>

10:15.905 --> 10:17.606
<i>I knew this wouldn't hold up,</i>

10:17.657 --> 10:19.024
<i>so I spend the night
writing a script</i>

10:19.075 --> 10:20.776
<i>that would weave
the customer footage</i>

10:20.827 --> 10:22.327
<i>into a clear narrative.</i>

10:22.362 --> 10:23.695
<i>To make it more compelling,</i>

10:23.697 --> 10:26.281
<i>I added a love story
for my character</i>

10:26.332 --> 10:28.751
<i>and cast an actress
to play my girlfriend,</i>

10:28.785 --> 10:29.952
<i>and later that week,</i>

10:30.003 --> 10:32.254
<i>we officially began production
on </i> The Web <i>.</i>

10:32.288 --> 10:35.874
Have you ever done
an on-camera kiss before, or...

10:35.925 --> 10:37.126
- I have, yeah.
- Oh, yeah? Yeah.

10:37.177 --> 10:38.127
- Have you?
- What?

10:38.178 --> 10:39.461
- Have you?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:39.512 --> 10:40.462
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, cool.

10:40.513 --> 10:41.630
It's not like we're kissing.

10:41.681 --> 10:43.182
It's like our characters
are kissing.

10:43.216 --> 10:44.183
- Oh, sure, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:44.217 --> 10:45.717
So it's, like, you know,

10:45.719 --> 10:48.437
it's not, like,
a big deal or anything.

10:48.471 --> 10:50.022
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:50.056 --> 10:51.390
<i>After some actor-to-actor talk,</i>

10:51.392 --> 10:52.391
<i>We began the scene.</i>

10:52.393 --> 10:54.860
I love you so much, Richard.

10:54.894 --> 10:56.728
I love you too, Allison.

10:56.730 --> 10:58.230
Come here.

11:02.035 --> 11:04.319
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

11:04.370 --> 11:06.955
I know.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.657
I haven't done this before.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.542
It's okay.

11:10.577 --> 11:11.960
<i>It was a bit of a rocky start</i>

11:11.995 --> 11:13.962
<i>as my nerves kept
getting in the way.</i>

11:13.997 --> 11:15.747
<i>And as the takes went on,</i>

11:15.749 --> 11:17.416
<i>I was having trouble
staying in character</i>

11:17.467 --> 11:20.669
<i>because I was really enjoying
the kisses.</i>

11:20.720 --> 11:23.922
<i>But with time, our chemistry
became very natural,</i>

11:25.758 --> 11:28.477
<i>and after calling Ronnie back
to shoot some additional scenes,</i>

11:28.511 --> 11:32.181
<i>I felt like we had enough
to make a somewhat logical film.</i>

11:32.232 --> 11:34.933
<i>So I returned to Judge Filosa
and showed him the entire movie</i>

11:34.935 --> 11:37.569
<i>to see if we were in the clear.</i>

11:37.604 --> 11:39.354
So this is it?

11:39.405 --> 11:40.606
It's a rough cut.

11:40.608 --> 11:42.407
If this is your defense

11:42.442 --> 11:43.775
and it's in front of a jury,

11:43.777 --> 11:45.611
they'd laugh you
out of the courtroom.

11:45.613 --> 11:46.612
But this--

11:46.614 --> 11:48.280
You said
anything can be a movie.

11:48.282 --> 11:49.781
No, but I--

11:49.783 --> 11:52.334
I'm assuming a movie has to have
some kind of a plot.

11:52.368 --> 11:53.752
There's a plot.

11:53.786 --> 11:55.003
What's the plot?

11:55.038 --> 11:56.421
He would save the world
through hacking.

11:56.456 --> 11:57.623
Going into a store?

11:57.674 --> 11:58.707
<i>Judge Filosa's reaction</i>

11:58.758 --> 12:00.292
<i>was beginning to worry me,</i>

12:00.343 --> 12:02.377
<i>but then he offered
a glimmer of hope.</i>

12:02.428 --> 12:05.514
If it was accepted
by the showbiz community

12:05.548 --> 12:07.799
as a movie and won an award,
then I--

12:07.801 --> 12:09.101
the court would have
to take that

12:09.135 --> 12:11.720
into consideration,
wouldn't it?

12:11.771 --> 12:12.721
<i>He was right.</i>

12:12.772 --> 12:14.139
<i>Winning an award
was the perfect way</i>

12:14.190 --> 12:16.475
<i>to make my movie
somewhat credible.</i>

12:16.477 --> 12:18.977
<i>So I sent copies of </i> The Web <i>
to several film festivals</i>

12:18.979 --> 12:22.314
<i>in the hope it would be
accepted into competition.</i>

12:22.316 --> 12:24.316
<i>But after getting
nothing but rejection letters,</i>

12:24.318 --> 12:27.035
<i>it seems like I only had
one option left:</i>

12:27.070 --> 12:29.454
<i>to start a film festival
of my own.</i>

12:29.489 --> 12:32.574
<i>So I came up with a name,
logo, and entry form,</i>

12:32.625 --> 12:35.460
<i>and then submitted </i> The Web <i>
in the short film category.</i>

12:35.495 --> 12:37.829
<i>But an award from my festival
would mean nothing</i>

12:37.831 --> 12:40.799
<i>without a respected name
from the film industry involved,</i>

12:40.833 --> 12:42.000
<i>So I made some calls...</i>

12:42.051 --> 12:44.636
Personally,
I am a huge fan of your work.

12:44.671 --> 12:45.637
<i>And was able to land</i>

12:45.672 --> 12:47.556
<i>the second unit
script supervisor</i>

12:47.590 --> 12:49.841
<i>from the Oscar-winning movie
</i> Bonnie and Clyde

12:49.893 --> 12:51.310
<i>to judge the film.</i>

12:51.344 --> 12:54.646
You know, I didn't see
any continuity errors at all.

12:54.681 --> 12:55.764
Thank you.

12:55.815 --> 12:57.649
Is that what
a script supervisor does?

12:57.684 --> 12:59.601
<i>All I needed now
was at least one other film</i>

12:59.652 --> 13:01.687
<i>that </i> The Web <i> would have
a chance of beating,</i>

13:01.738 --> 13:04.656
<i>and after a bit of searching,
I found a contender--</i>

13:04.691 --> 13:08.360
<i>a 90-second clip
of nothing but a man farting.</i>

13:11.365 --> 13:12.698
<i>And with a venue secured,</i>

13:12.749 --> 13:14.449
<i>it was time for the festival
to begin.</i>

13:15.638 --> 13:17.385
<i>Turnout to my festival
was slim,</i>

13:17.436 --> 13:19.137
<i>with only a few people
from the neighborhood</i>

13:19.188 --> 13:20.354
<i>buying tickets,</i>

13:20.389 --> 13:21.606
<i>but the only thing that mattered</i>

13:21.640 --> 13:23.891
<i>was that our industry judge
had arrived,</i>

13:23.942 --> 13:26.811
<i>and with Crayton in his seat,
it was time to start the show.</i>

13:26.862 --> 13:28.563
Welcome to the first annual

13:28.614 --> 13:33.651
Eastern Los Angeles
International Film Festival.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.072
Today is the short film
competition,

13:38.123 --> 13:39.157
And I'm excited to announce

13:39.159 --> 13:41.159
that judging our selection
of shorts

13:41.161 --> 13:45.580
is industry legend
Crayton Smith,

13:45.631 --> 13:49.000
who you might know
from being the script supervisor

13:49.002 --> 13:50.168
on <i> Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

13:50.219 --> 13:52.804
So you know if he picks a film
as the winner,

13:52.838 --> 13:55.506
it's definitely a real film.

13:58.093 --> 13:59.260
Come here a second.

13:59.311 --> 14:00.428
Oh.

14:00.479 --> 14:01.479
<i>Bonnie and Clyde,</i>

14:01.513 --> 14:02.680
I was just the second unit,
so...

14:02.731 --> 14:03.681
Just second unit?

14:03.732 --> 14:05.149
I had no credit or anything.

14:05.184 --> 14:08.102
You're credited on imdb
for <i> Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

14:08.153 --> 14:09.403
Yeah, but on <i> The Wild Bunch,</i>

14:09.438 --> 14:11.155
my credit is on the screen
and...

14:11.190 --> 14:12.523
Oh, okay, sure.

14:12.525 --> 14:14.192
So <i> The Wild Bunch</i>
you'd rather me say?

14:14.194 --> 14:15.910
Yeah, that's fine.

14:15.944 --> 14:17.862
So Crayton just informed me
that actually

14:17.864 --> 14:21.332
he was credited
as a script supervisor

14:21.366 --> 14:22.783
on <i> The Wild Bunch,</i> but--

14:22.835 --> 14:24.702
did work on <i> Bonnie and Clyde,</i>

14:24.704 --> 14:28.206
but was not credited.

14:29.675 --> 14:33.794
Okay, first up,
we have a sci-fi thriller

14:33.846 --> 14:34.879
called <i> The Web.</i>

14:34.881 --> 14:36.547

Coming in on weekends now,
Kip?

14:50.863 --> 14:53.231
I'm a hacker, Mel,
not a slacker.

14:53.282 --> 14:54.782
Cops are getting suspicious.

14:54.816 --> 14:55.983
You should get your own office,

14:56.034 --> 14:57.535
stop using my back room.

14:57.569 --> 15:00.571
Whatever, grandma.

15:00.573 --> 15:03.074
All right, it's hacking time.

15:07.045 --> 15:07.995
Thank you.

15:08.046 --> 15:10.498
Have a good day.

15:10.549 --> 15:12.717
Hey, boss, did you see this?

15:12.751 --> 15:14.835
Microsoft's been putting
microchips into asteroids

15:14.887 --> 15:15.970
to control them.

15:16.004 --> 15:17.755
This can't be good.

15:17.806 --> 15:19.090
You should tell Kip.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.642
Right.

15:21.677 --> 15:23.561
What are you up to,
Mr. Gates?

15:25.098 --> 15:27.598
Crap, the cops are here.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.433
Let me distract them
while you figure this out.

15:29.484 --> 15:31.435
Okay, cool.

15:31.437 --> 15:33.154
Oh, hello, Officer Suzanne.

15:33.188 --> 15:34.272
Hi.

15:34.323 --> 15:36.107
How's the hacker investigation
going?

15:36.158 --> 15:37.275
Go ahead.

15:37.277 --> 15:38.910
Oh, no leads yet
at all, so...

15:38.944 --> 15:41.946
Okay.
That'll be $87, please.

15:45.334 --> 15:46.500
<i>Danger.</i>

15:46.535 --> 15:50.755
<i>Asteroid microchip malfunction.</i>

15:50.789 --> 15:52.873
Oh, no.

15:52.925 --> 15:55.343
What have I done wrong?

15:55.377 --> 15:57.211
I can't believe this.

15:57.262 --> 15:59.547
I've worked so hard

15:59.598 --> 16:04.051
to get this computer project
going.

16:04.102 --> 16:05.803
This is unheard of.

16:05.805 --> 16:07.305
What's going on?

16:07.356 --> 16:08.723
It looks like
there are asteroids

16:08.774 --> 16:10.391
on a straight trajectory
towards Earth.

16:10.442 --> 16:12.276
<i>We'll all be dead
in five minutes.</i>

16:12.311 --> 16:13.361
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

16:13.395 --> 16:14.528
<i>There's a microchip in there.</i>

16:14.563 --> 16:15.529
<i>Can't you hack it?</i>

16:15.564 --> 16:17.064
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

16:17.115 --> 16:19.150
Crap, I have a girlfriend.

16:22.955 --> 16:24.372
Sorry I had to call you
away from work.

16:24.406 --> 16:26.157
This just might be
our last chance

16:26.159 --> 16:28.326
to say good-bye
before the asteroid hits.

16:28.328 --> 16:31.796
Oh, no.

16:31.830 --> 16:33.748
I love you so much, Richard.

16:33.799 --> 16:36.083
I love you too, Allison.

16:36.134 --> 16:38.302
Come here.

<i>I hacked faster
than I've ever hacked before.</i>

17:04.530 --> 17:06.696
<i>When word of the asteroid
got out,</i>

17:06.699 --> 17:09.000
<i>people were racing
to get supplies.</i>

17:09.034 --> 17:10.034
<i>Everyone wanted souvenirs</i>

17:10.085 --> 17:11.669
<i>so they could remember
the Earth.</i>

17:11.703 --> 17:12.670
<i>And people were sad.</i>

17:12.704 --> 17:13.871
Oh.

17:13.873 --> 17:15.256
<i>Angry mobs formed
on the street.</i>

17:16.675 --> 17:19.042
<i>The odds of me stopping
this asteroid were slim,</i>

17:19.094 --> 17:20.211
<i>but I had to try.</i>

17:20.213 --> 17:22.762
<i>Asteroid access granted.</i>

17:22.798 --> 17:25.683
<i>Trajectory has been
reprogrammed.</i>

17:25.717 --> 17:27.468
I did it.

17:27.519 --> 17:28.936
You saved the world, Kip.

17:28.970 --> 17:30.938
♪ The time is now,
start the day ♪

17:30.972 --> 17:33.274
<i>♪ Set the goal,
get underway ♪</i>

17:33.308 --> 17:35.192
The Web <i> went over as expected,</i>

17:35.227 --> 17:37.445
<i>and now it was time
to seal my fate</i>

17:37.479 --> 17:38.729
<i>as the best film of the night.</i>

17:38.780 --> 17:41.532
Our next short
is a documentary

17:41.566 --> 17:45.152
called <i> Me Farting on Command.</i>

18:18.938 --> 18:20.404
<i>My hope was that
the fart movie</i>

18:20.439 --> 18:22.523
<i>served its purpose,</i>

18:22.574 --> 18:24.275
<i>because now that the screening
was over,</i>

18:24.326 --> 18:26.994
<i>it was up to our judge
to pick the best short,</i>

18:27.028 --> 18:29.864
<i>and I nervously awaited
his decision.</i>

18:29.915 --> 18:33.033
Okay, here you go.

18:33.085 --> 18:34.201
All right.

18:40.592 --> 18:41.625
Selected <i> The Web.</i>

18:41.627 --> 18:42.626
I did.

18:42.628 --> 18:43.627
All right.

18:43.629 --> 18:44.879
Hand me this award...

18:44.930 --> 18:46.380
- All right.
- For best short film.

18:46.431 --> 18:47.515
Hand it to you now?

18:47.549 --> 18:49.266
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, uh, this--

18:49.301 --> 18:50.968
You don't need a speech
or anything, yeah.

18:50.970 --> 18:51.969
- Good.
- Thank you.

18:51.971 --> 18:52.970
<i>I did it,</i>

18:52.972 --> 18:53.971
<i>and with the award in hand,</i>

18:53.973 --> 18:55.473
<i>we now had proof</i>

18:55.524 --> 18:57.108
<i>that my marketing plan
for L.A. Fame</i>

18:57.142 --> 18:59.477
<i>was 100% legal.</i>

18:59.479 --> 19:00.895
<i>My work here was done,</i>

19:00.946 --> 19:02.396
<i>but there was one more person</i>

19:02.447 --> 19:04.115
<i>I wanted to share
the good news with.</i>

19:04.877 --> 19:07.205
<i>I was so proud
of my movie's success,</i>

19:07.256 --> 19:09.340
<i>and I couldn't wait
to tell my costar, Jessee.</i>

19:09.374 --> 19:11.509
I don't know if you know,
but the film we did

19:11.543 --> 19:12.510
actually won an award.

19:12.544 --> 19:14.045
- What?
- Yeah.

19:14.047 --> 19:15.546
What award?

19:15.548 --> 19:18.382
Eastern Los Angeles
International Film Festival.

19:18.384 --> 19:19.550
All right, that's exciting.

19:19.552 --> 19:20.551
It's exciting, yeah.

19:20.553 --> 19:21.552
Pretty good.

19:21.554 --> 19:22.553
Yeah, yeah.

19:22.555 --> 19:24.472
Anyways,
there was something

19:24.523 --> 19:27.558
I wanted to actually
talk to you about.

19:27.609 --> 19:29.227
When we did that--

19:29.229 --> 19:32.396
the kissing scene
that we did,

19:32.447 --> 19:36.400
and I told you
I was in character,

19:36.402 --> 19:40.321
but that might have been a lie.

19:42.124 --> 19:44.075
Well, that's okay.

19:44.126 --> 19:46.077
I feel like
there might have been

19:46.128 --> 19:48.963
some of me in there,

19:48.997 --> 19:51.082
and I guess
I was wondering

19:51.084 --> 19:54.635
if when you did the kiss...

19:54.670 --> 19:56.754
how much of that
was your character

19:56.805 --> 19:58.756
and how much of that was you?

20:01.760 --> 20:05.596
Uh...

20:05.598 --> 20:07.765
Meaning did I, like--

20:07.816 --> 20:09.100
did I want to kiss you?

20:09.102 --> 20:11.319
Me, Jessee?

20:11.353 --> 20:12.486
Yeah.

20:12.521 --> 20:15.857
Uh...

20:15.908 --> 20:17.525
I mean,

20:17.576 --> 20:21.162
It wasn't a big deal,

20:21.196 --> 20:23.247
but I probably wouldn't
grab you on the street

20:23.282 --> 20:27.285
and just kiss you
out of nowhere.

20:27.336 --> 20:29.287
Good to know, I guess.

20:29.338 --> 20:31.122
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:32.125 --> 20:35.209
<i>In that moment,
I felt sorry for Jessee.</i>

20:35.260 --> 20:37.128
<i>To share a kiss
with another human</i>

20:37.179 --> 20:40.214
<i>and feel nothing
is a horrible way to live.</i>

20:40.265 --> 20:43.134
<i>As I drove home,
I finally understood</i>

20:43.185 --> 20:45.386
<i>what it felt like
to be a tourist,</i>

20:45.437 --> 20:47.605
<i>going somewhere
with so much hope</i>

20:47.639 --> 20:50.024
<i>and leaving with nothing
but a souvenir.</i>
