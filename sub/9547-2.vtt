Naw, man, I got a limo
picking me up, dog.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.331
Yo, you got company.

00:12.852 --> 00:13.868
Another reporter.

00:14.123 --> 00:16.014
No rest for the wicked,

00:16.044 --> 00:18.001
- Yeah, right.

- Al right, babe.
- Extra Large,

00:19.902 --> 00:22.979
- can I ask a few questions?
- Yo, can a brothe get some sleep, baby?

00:23.027 --> 00:25.936
Give a girl a break. I've been here
all night. They wouldn't let me in.

00:25.999 --> 00:28.784
Cause they knew you was gonna
harass me. Matter of fact, remind me

00:28.855 --> 00:31.497

Ever since you left your old label,
Murderuss has been saying some

00:46.177 --> 00:48.759
- pretty wicked things about you.
- You asking me if I'm afraid?

00:48.780 --> 00:50.113
Is that what you asking me?

00:50.363 --> 00:54.256
Yo I ain't scared, a'ight? What they say
on their records, it just this and that.

00:54.312 --> 00:55.966
It's about what I say onmyrecords.

00:56.284 --> 00:58.555
It's all just talk.
Just harshing each other.

00:58.613 --> 01:02.981
You're sure? Cause on his new album, he
comes out and says it he wants you dead.

01:03.793 --> 01:07.173
Yo, times are violent, so the rhymes are
violent. You know what I'm saying?

01:08.348 --> 01:10.081
Look like your time is up.

01:11.126 --> 01:13.526
Yo, what's up, man?
I'm out here waiting and stuff, man.

01:14.023 --> 01:16.157
Sorry I'm late. Had a
drop-off all the way uptown.

01:16.970 --> 01:21.947
Don't sweat it. Yo, make sure they spell
my name right. Extra Large.

01:23.386 --> 01:25.636
- Take care of yourself.
- Don't worry about me, baby.

I hate daylight savings time.
Five, four, three,

- Ya! Perfect!

02:59.278 --> 03:01.755
- No, it's 2 seconds off.
- No, no, Mr.Monk.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.236
No one's ever gonna notice.

03:03.286 --> 03:05.646
- No one except for you.
- Let's just try it one more time.

03:05.681 --> 03:09.075
Come on, it's only twice a year.
Here we go. In 55.

03:09.626 --> 03:12.007

03:24.994 --> 03:27.777
Y- you're welcome!
Yeah, get ready. 42 seconds.

03:28.131 --> 03:30.714
Mr. Monk, I'm not your secretary.
I'm your assistant.

03:30.756 --> 03:32.969
Yeah, secretary.
It's the same thing... 35.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.080
No. No. It's not the same thing.
Can we talk about this in 31 seconds?

03:38.080 --> 03:42.465
Do you think a secretary has to do what
I do?  It's a huge responsibility.

03:42.876 --> 03:46.074
What? What about the Secretary of State?
That's a very important job.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.963
Or Secretariat,
Triple Crown winner.

03:48.052 --> 03:49.502
Love to see an assistant
do that.

03:50.152 --> 03:52.257
You don't respect me
at all, do you?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.566
I mean, really,
really respect me.

03:54.622 --> 03:56.156
Of course I do... 22.

03:57.519 --> 03:59.222
I do, Nat...
Ooh, doorbell.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.990
Natalie, hurry back.
Hurry back. 15.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.427
Never mind!

04:05.790 --> 04:07.357
Come in, it's open!

04:07.382 --> 04:09.602
This is it, ten seconds.
Here we go. Nine.

04:10.453 --> 04:13.917
Natalie, eight. Natalie,
seven. Natalie, six.

04:13.931 --> 04:15.849
- Mr. Monk...
- Hold on. Four.

04:16.099 --> 04:17.829
Three. Natalie. Two...

04:23.907 --> 04:24.907
Howdy.

04:26.158 --> 04:28.824
- Are you Monk?
- Please, Adrian.

04:30.586 --> 04:34.458
Excuse us, we were just, uh, we were
just setting the clocks forward there.

04:34.509 --> 04:36.724
- Daylight savings time and all.
- Ah, hell,

04:36.763 --> 04:38.396
man. I always forget to do that.

04:39.881 --> 04:42.698
That's a beautiful watch.
Oh, you like that, huh?

04:43.080 --> 04:46.683
It's that white gold. Imported. I have
to get you one next time I see you.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.341
- They're his trademark.
- Really?

04:50.558 --> 04:51.558
Sorry!

04:53.309 --> 04:55.518
My name is Murderuss.

04:56.342 --> 04:57.342
Murderuss?

04:57.669 --> 04:58.869
I've heard of you!

04:59.183 --> 05:01.531
I've taken your records away
from my daughter.

05:01.556 --> 05:04.232
You'll have to excuse Natalie.
She's a little prudish

05:04.270 --> 05:06.217
- about that stuff.
- I'm different these days.

05:06.301 --> 05:08.451
I'm more of a businessman.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.921
Have my own record label.
Manslaughter Records.

05:12.672 --> 05:14.955
This is Snake Da Assassin, my VP.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.025
Mr. Assassin.

05:18.773 --> 05:19.940
Sss.

05:19.991 --> 05:23.718
- Hello.
- And this is Silent Killa,

05:23.904 --> 05:25.274
secretary of defense.

05:25.916 --> 05:29.756
Secretary? Uh-oh. Natalie here thinks
secretary is a dirty word.

05:32.601 --> 05:33.601
Have you seen that?

05:36.054 --> 05:37.670
My lawyer's already calling me.

05:38.452 --> 05:40.342
Police looking for me.
They think I did it.

05:40.433 --> 05:42.649
Well, uh, why would they think that?

05:42.777 --> 05:44.394
- Motive, yo.
- Motive, yo.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.852
The deceased, Extra Large,
used to record on my label.

05:48.491 --> 05:50.319
But the splits wasn't exactly cordial.

05:50.504 --> 05:51.851
I hate that motherf...

05:53.935 --> 05:54.935
fella.

05:55.951 --> 05:57.168
I hate that fella.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.885
- Is this all they have?
- Plus, about a month ago,

06:01.164 --> 06:04.896
I made a song talking about how I wanted
to kill him and how I planned to do it.

06:05.169 --> 06:07.308
Tick, tick, tick, tick

06:07.502 --> 06:08.952
Ka-boo...

06:12.776 --> 06:14.576
Name of the song wasCar Bomb.

06:14.965 --> 06:17.912
And that's the exact same way he died,
you know what I'm saying?

06:18.054 --> 06:19.887
Now, look, I'm no angel,

06:19.989 --> 06:22.534
and I never pretended to be.
But this time,

06:23.201 --> 06:25.399
- this wasn't me.
- No. Of course it wasn't.

06:26.324 --> 06:28.024
We've been asking around, and...

06:28.432 --> 06:31.211
street's been saying you're
some kind of super cop.

06:31.430 --> 06:34.244
Well, I guess if other people say it,
it's not really bragging.

06:34.771 --> 06:36.054
You feelin' me there, Silent?

06:36.591 --> 06:40.090
- He's feelin' me.
- I wanna hire you.

06:40.908 --> 06:45.109
I want you to do what you do, sniff
around and get me the hell outta this.

06:45.318 --> 06:46.920
Oh, we're flattered.

06:47.075 --> 06:49.204
We really are. But we really,
were just talking about

06:49.242 --> 06:51.628
- we have so many other commitments.
- Don't listen to her.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.187
- I'll take the case. I'm your man.
- Well, all right.

06:54.727 --> 06:57.156
It's an honor. It's a privilege.

06:57.562 --> 07:00.052
And don't you worry, because I am gonna
get you out of this.

07:00.205 --> 07:03.133
- My word is my bond.
- Now, that's...

07:03.598 --> 07:05.044
what I needed to hear.

07:05.311 --> 07:06.377
Pay the man.

07:07.787 --> 07:08.887
Here's a retainer...

07:10.568 --> 07:14.051
and my business card. You call me as
soon as you get some good news.

07:14.074 --> 07:16.099
Natalie, it was a pleasure
meeting you, beautiful.

07:16.156 --> 07:18.091
Thank you for your
business, Mr. Murderuss.

07:19.541 --> 07:20.607
Mr. Assassin.

07:21.926 --> 07:24.079
Mr. Killer. Sorry... Killa.

07:24.241 --> 07:25.624
K- Killa.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.039
Natalie, Killa.

07:28.670 --> 07:30.953
Don't worry about anything.
I got your back, yo.

07:32.011 --> 07:37.118
Have a nice day, yo.

07:38.586 --> 07:39.669
That was close.

07:39.772 --> 07:42.538
- Are you okay?
- But he seemed to take it

07:42.629 --> 07:44.870
pretty well, didn't you think?
Take what well?

07:45.689 --> 07:47.930
When I turned down the case.
When I said I was too busy.

07:48.239 --> 07:49.539
Mr. Monk, you said yes.

07:49.728 --> 07:50.811
You took the case.

07:54.388 --> 07:56.074
He wrote you a check. It's right there.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.888
Natalie, there's nothing in my hand.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.818
Mr. Monk, it's right here.

08:03.972 --> 08:06.395
You said yes. You gave him your word.

08:06.538 --> 08:07.888
You said you had his back.

08:30.847 --> 08:32.697
That piece... goes there.

08:33.573 --> 08:34.741
And that piece...

08:35.414 --> 08:36.881
goes near the front.

08:39.378 --> 08:40.578
You're pretty good

08:41.034 --> 08:43.578
- at this. Have a secret?
- You do the corners first.

08:46.479 --> 08:47.696
Can't believe he's dead.

08:48.386 --> 08:49.452
You a fan?

08:50.217 --> 08:52.750
- No.
- Extra Large?

08:53.495 --> 08:55.645
He's the godfather
of second-wave east coast rap.

08:56.055 --> 09:01.114
You know, this was before Jay-Z, Nas,
50 Cent, Fat Joe. I loved his stuff.

09:02.455 --> 09:05.809
Got myself strapped
for the war goin' down, down

09:05.869 --> 09:09.253
I looked death in the face and I called
him a clown, clown Pulled out my nin...

09:09.296 --> 09:11.724
Randy, do you think
the captain respects you?

09:12.716 --> 09:14.199
Does he respect me? Yeah.

09:15.457 --> 09:16.773
He teases me a lot.

09:18.067 --> 09:25.036
Yeah, but at the end of theday, I think
my opinion means something. Why?

09:27.394 --> 09:30.334
Found the limo driver over there. He's
in intensive care. We think

09:31.017 --> 09:34.351
- he's gonna survive.
- You okay?

09:36.854 --> 09:39.811
- Car bomb. Mm-hmm. You wanna
- sit this one out?

09:40.437 --> 09:42.770
No. No, I'm good.

09:43.746 --> 09:47.802
We've already got a primary. Get this...
the guy had a rival, another rapper.

09:47.865 --> 09:49.747
They'd been threatening
each other for months,

09:49.794 --> 09:52.530
even wrote little ditties about
each other. Guess what his name is.

09:52.577 --> 09:54.726
- Murderuss.
- That's right!

09:55.466 --> 09:58.274
Is that perfect, or what?
I can't wait till a jury hears that.

09:58.314 --> 10:00.837
Well, it's only a name.
Doesn't mean anything.

10:01.446 --> 10:04.932
Murderuss? Monk, that's not
a name. It's a confession.

10:05.262 --> 10:07.876
Plus, the guy has got
a rap sheet like 10 miles long.

10:07.909 --> 10:12.345
- Alleged rap sheet.
- No, a very real, grown-up rap sheet.

10:12.468 --> 10:15.855
I arrested the kid myself three times
back when he was a hood in the 'hood.

10:16.951 --> 10:20.624
- What are you, his lawyer?
- I don't know. Natalie am I his lawyer?

10:20.827 --> 10:22.627
No. You're his investigator.

10:22.797 --> 10:24.534
Murderuss paid us a little visit today.

10:24.730 --> 10:27.093
- He came to your house.
- He was afraid he was gonna get

10:27.164 --> 10:29.535
blamed for this, so he asked Mr. Monk
to take the case.

10:29.732 --> 10:32.655
- And you said yes.
- Well, so I've been told.

10:32.722 --> 10:35.442
- I wasn't really there.
- You did it again.

10:36.396 --> 10:40.537
When he gets nervous, he blacks out
sometimes and agrees to do stuff.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.240
God. Oh, my God,

10:42.300 --> 10:43.300
what did I do?

10:43.335 --> 10:45.542
Well, look, maybe you're right.
Maybe he's not the guy.

10:45.589 --> 10:48.674
Of course he's the guy!
His name is Murderuss.

10:49.077 --> 10:50.727
I mean, I cannot believe

10:50.873 --> 10:52.638
- this is happening.
- Captain,

10:52.705 --> 10:53.893
we found the detonator.

10:55.491 --> 10:56.674
Wow, what is this, silver?

10:56.675 --> 10:58.912
Naw, that's white gold. Imported.

10:59.296 --> 11:01.425
- Well, how do you know that?
- Cause my client

11:01.480 --> 11:05.441
wears them all the time. They're his
trademark. I am... so screwed!

11:06.626 --> 11:08.076
And where were you?

11:08.603 --> 11:11.060
Don't look at me.
I'm just the secretary.

11:17.897 --> 11:21.214
Extra Large was your
biggest star, your cash cow.

11:21.436 --> 11:24.113
But he left your label and
started recording for Fresh P...

11:24.279 --> 11:25.931
- Fresh Produce...
- Fresh Rhymes.

11:26.014 --> 11:27.103
Fresh Rhymes Records.

11:27.173 --> 11:28.940
You couldn't stand that,
could you, Russell?

11:28.973 --> 11:32.509
- My name is Murderuss.
- Well, you'll always be Russell to me.

11:33.311 --> 11:35.911
Little Russell Kroy
from Millburn Avenue.

11:36.361 --> 11:39.597
Flushing dime bags down the
toilet every time I came knockin'.

11:43.559 --> 11:45.296
Does this one belong to you?

11:48.544 --> 11:50.097
It's one of your trademarks, isn't it?

11:50.828 --> 11:52.949
It's like those Special Edition
Ponys you're wearing?

11:54.322 --> 11:57.466
- It'd make an excellent
- timing device. I ain't no bomb maker.

11:57.605 --> 12:00.824
Well, you don't have to be a bomb maker.
Any Boy Scout could make this.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.506
What you do is you take one wire and you
connect it to the hour hand,

12:04.560 --> 12:06.505
and the other wire goes to the face.

12:06.696 --> 12:09.279
Tick, tick, tick, tick. 9:00... kaboom.

12:09.512 --> 12:10.845
- Guess what.
- What?

12:11.014 --> 12:12.408
I ain't a Boy Scout either.

12:14.948 --> 12:15.948
No kiddin'.

12:18.078 --> 12:22.304
How 'bout this, Russell? It's a blasting
cap. See here? That's a serial number.

12:22.352 --> 12:25.175
That's how we know that this particular
blasting cap was stolen

12:25.206 --> 12:27.939
from a construction site a half
a block away from your house.

12:28.329 --> 12:31.615
I am not going to be putting a bomb
up onto somebody's town car.

12:32.008 --> 12:33.009
You know me.

12:33.093 --> 12:35.110
I'm up close and personal, face-to-face.

12:35.384 --> 12:36.541
Not according to this.

12:38.938 --> 12:39.938
Track four.

12:41.025 --> 12:42.959
Little song calledCar Bomb.

12:46.054 --> 12:49.520
Put the bomb in your lim
That's what the surprise is

12:49.573 --> 12:52.694
Under your seat Like Oprah giving prizes

12:53.523 --> 12:56.341
- Sound familiar?
- Not the way you do it.

12:57.178 --> 12:58.881
Yeah, well, I wasn't
really performing it.

12:59.389 --> 13:02.269
Look, you got to be one of the
whitest white boys I've ever met.

13:02.857 --> 13:04.683
And I met Kevin Costner.
Well, uh, could have

13:04.816 --> 13:05.816
done it right...

13:05.931 --> 13:09.022
brought in a beat box. Captain
wouldn't let me. I owe you one.

13:09.762 --> 13:10.933
You know what?

13:11.168 --> 13:13.240
You're not the only
musician in the room.

13:14.133 --> 13:17.033
Actually, I'm in a band too.
We have a very eclectic repertoire.

13:17.484 --> 13:19.163
We do rap.
We also do folk.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.537
What is this, good cop, demented cop?

13:21.751 --> 13:23.451
- Yo, just go to my website.
- Randy!

13:23.893 --> 13:25.280
- He called me white!
- Sit down.

13:25.350 --> 13:26.492
- Don't deny it.
- Sit down!

13:35.642 --> 13:36.765
Yo got a problem, Russell.

13:36.810 --> 13:40.276
The limo driver was with the car
all night long. He probably saw

13:40.322 --> 13:41.707
whoever planted this.

13:43.070 --> 13:46.371
He's gonna pull through, and when he
does, he's gonna tell me what he saw.

13:46.412 --> 13:47.495
Well, he didn't see me.

13:47.875 --> 13:52.127
I'm being set up. I'm innocent.
All you gotta d is ask Adrian Monk.

13:52.491 --> 13:53.648
Ain't he one of y'all?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.191
I thought he was up here.

13:56.078 --> 13:58.319
He'll tell you. He know what's
happening. I been set up,

13:58.358 --> 14:00.175
and this is a bunch of bull, man.

14:01.229 --> 14:02.331
I can't believe this.

14:06.547 --> 14:09.711
- Well, I mean I don't think it was him.
- Of course it was him.

14:09.745 --> 14:13.753
Didn't you hear the captain? There's
amountain of evidence. He is so... so,

14:14.320 --> 14:17.392
so guilty. He is what we call

14:17.615 --> 14:19.720
very guilty.
Mr. Monk, you're just so nervous,

14:19.796 --> 14:22.766
you're not thinking straight.
If he did it, why did he hire you?

14:22.816 --> 14:24.567
You're the best detective in California.

14:24.617 --> 14:27.826
Probably his lawyer's idea.
It's just PR to make it look good.

14:27.876 --> 14:32.169
I don't think so. I think he's
frightened. He's like you in a way.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.036
I think deep, deep down

14:34.225 --> 14:36.568
he's just this frightened little boy.

14:37.516 --> 14:39.782
A- a-and this is based on what?

14:39.965 --> 14:40.965
I have a hunch.

14:42.253 --> 14:43.253
Okay.

14:43.314 --> 14:45.774
You get hunches all the time.
People don't laugh at you.

14:45.829 --> 14:47.357
People laugh at me. Plenty.

14:47.550 --> 14:48.683
But not about that.

14:48.806 --> 14:50.940
The captain gets hunches.
Why can't I have a hunch?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.390
Oh, I get it. I get it.

14:52.811 --> 14:54.928
This is about
the secretary thing, isn't it?

14:55.157 --> 14:57.424
And how you don't think I...

14:58.105 --> 14:59.105
something about...

14:59.288 --> 15:01.255
not respecting...

15:02.126 --> 15:04.930
- Wait. I wrote it down.
- Mr. Monk, this is not about me.

15:05.127 --> 15:06.843
This is about your client.

15:06.912 --> 15:09.568
That man is in trouble,
and he's depending on you.

15:09.649 --> 15:11.166
You shook his hand.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.200
Wipe.

15:29.868 --> 15:34.375
game shoppin' I'm trying to holler
a little, ma, her booty poppin

15:34.424 --> 15:36.886
I don't wanna date you
I'm trying to bait you

15:37.074 --> 15:39.087
To the house, we ain't gotta go out

15:39.204 --> 15:41.593
One more song, I'm takin' you home

15:41.594 --> 15:43.899
One more dance,
I'm takin' off your pants

15:44.016 --> 15:45.853
The mind, the man the myth

15:45.970 --> 15:48.864
You can smell the game,
in the air baby Take a whiff

15:48.980 --> 15:50.387
How much longer?

15:50.816 --> 15:51.826
I like it.

15:52.019 --> 15:56.142
Do keep grillin',but I ain't trippin
I'm in the zone, 26 inch chrome

15:56.226 --> 15:58.670
We in the doghouse gettin' it on

16:06.361 --> 16:07.792
Sounded kickin' to me.

16:07.946 --> 16:09.371
Let's reset, do one more.

16:09.833 --> 16:12.239
Yeah, I like that one. Good stuff.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.269
Thank you so much
for seeing us, Mr. Hodges.

16:14.326 --> 16:16.106
Oh, please, call me Denny.

16:16.353 --> 16:18.005
Hi, I'm Waddy. Sorry.

16:18.724 --> 16:21.348
Hi, Waddy. I've never been
in a recording studio before.

16:21.485 --> 16:23.115
Oh, look at all these gold records!

16:23.651 --> 16:26.118
And this... this is our first
hit two years ago.

16:26.464 --> 16:29.189
- What are they so mad about?
- Oh, about everything.

16:30.020 --> 16:33.398
Cops, women, money. Thank God, cause
that anger's gonna put my kids

16:33.483 --> 16:34.567
through college.

16:35.011 --> 16:37.009
Oh, wow. Oh, there he is.

16:37.195 --> 16:42.312
- I'm so sorry about what happened.
- So are we. He was a big talent

16:42.501 --> 16:44.823
- with a big heart.
- And a big profit margin.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.713
- At least, that was the game plan.
- Waddy and I spent every nickel

16:48.741 --> 16:52.049
we had signing Extra Large,
and, well, now we gotta

16:52.091 --> 16:54.335
start all over again
with kids like Da Money.

16:54.493 --> 16:57.577
I mean, he's years away from paying
the rent, but... Maestro, we gonna

16:57.664 --> 16:58.664
do this or what?

16:58.723 --> 17:01.533
You want it fastor you want it good?
Want it fast. Good.

17:01.941 --> 17:04.607
My partner doesn't know anything
about the music business You have

17:04.645 --> 17:05.911
to spend money to make money.

17:06.476 --> 17:07.776
Where were you when you...

17:08.337 --> 17:10.605
first heard that Extra Large
had been murdered?

17:10.646 --> 17:13.387
Where was I? If I live to be a hundred,

17:13.488 --> 17:14.508
I'll never forget it.

17:14.588 --> 17:16.242
I was in my hotel room with Waddy.

17:16.397 --> 17:18.699
We were having breakfast.
We weren't having breakfast.

17:18.711 --> 17:21.000
- He was having breakfast.
- Are you gonna do this here?

17:21.061 --> 17:22.608
Every Sunday we have breakfast together

17:22.633 --> 17:25.478
to figure out what we're gonna do with
the money, where it's all going.

17:25.548 --> 17:27.671
Last Sunday morning,
I had to take my limo uptown.

17:27.758 --> 17:30.415
- I forgot, okay?
- I show up. He's halfway through

17:30.462 --> 17:33.033
with his eggs Benedict.
There's not even a place setting for me.

17:33.062 --> 17:35.403
I forgot. I'm sorry
I forgot to order you room service.

17:35.486 --> 17:37.150
After two years, he forgets.

17:37.237 --> 17:38.904
- You just...
- The worst day

17:38.971 --> 17:41.188
of our lives, okay?
I lost my best friend.

17:41.359 --> 17:44.384
And he's still bitching about breakfast.
You ready?

17:44.502 --> 17:46.526
Yeah, man,
I'm still working on these lyrics.

17:46.719 --> 17:48.311
Tell me what you like better, though.

17:48.679 --> 17:50.962
Club hoppin game shoppin

17:50.963 --> 17:53.313
I'm trying to holler a little,
ma, her booty poppin'

17:53.861 --> 17:55.278
Poppin' or bangin'?

17:55.961 --> 17:56.961
I like bangin'.

17:57.271 --> 17:59.571
- What do you think?
- I like bangin.

17:59.723 --> 18:02.665
Yeah. Yeah, definitely poppin.

18:02.675 --> 18:05.292
Okay, so it's 2 to 2.
Hey, homey, what about you?

18:05.632 --> 18:06.632
Me? Uh...

18:07.504 --> 18:09.698
- I'm sorry...
- Poppin' or bangin'?

18:09.770 --> 18:10.987
Poppin' or bangin'.

18:11.497 --> 18:12.497
Poppin' or bangin'?

18:14.415 --> 18:15.912
First off,
thank you for asking.

18:16.436 --> 18:17.636
Um, poppin'...

18:18.445 --> 18:20.942
- What does poppin' mean again?
- Poppin' is just like,

18:21.013 --> 18:23.651
you know, really crackin'.
You feel me? Like, just...

18:23.882 --> 18:29.115
Like when the booty
is just like... Ah! You feel me?

18:29.584 --> 18:30.634
I feel you.

18:30.717 --> 18:34.002
Uh, and what does poppin' mean again?

18:34.339 --> 18:36.202
I just told you,
it's like really crackin'.

18:36.376 --> 18:40.031
- They both mean good,
- Mr. Monk. Yeah,poppin' or bangin'.

18:40.511 --> 18:42.940
wow. Pressure. Uh...

18:43.503 --> 18:46.422
I- I think it'd be a lot easier

18:46.506 --> 18:49.542
if I actually met the girl. Pop, bang...

18:49.600 --> 18:52.282
I'm gonna have to go with bangin'.

18:52.495 --> 18:54.714
Naw... no. Wait.

18:56.483 --> 19:00.016
Um, this is hard, because
they're both so evocative.

19:00.358 --> 19:04.117
- Poppin'... Is it poppin' or boppin'?
- Let's just take a break.

19:04.181 --> 19:05.887
Yeah. How long a break?

19:06.093 --> 19:07.160
I don't know.

19:07.362 --> 19:09.648
- How long you think he'll be staying?
- What's crackin'?

19:10.409 --> 19:12.442
Is it crackin' or cracklin'?

19:12.555 --> 19:13.588
Man...

19:18.903 --> 19:20.320
Mr. Monk, Mr. Monk.

19:20.513 --> 19:24.140
Listen, um, you told me to call
you if I rembered anything.

19:24.159 --> 19:26.430
Well, I was thinking about it, and
Saturday night,

19:26.725 --> 19:27.949
the night before it happened,

19:28.377 --> 19:29.559
I was leaving my office.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.229
It's, like, 7:00 exactly. I remember,

19:32.289 --> 19:34.798
cause I was late for a meeting.
I looked at my watch.

19:35.232 --> 19:38.049
- And...
- I saw somebody.

19:40.023 --> 19:42.106
Yeah... he was hanging out
near the garage

19:42.165 --> 19:45.268
where the limo was parked.
And, you know I thought it was weird.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.832
Couldn't figure out why
he was hanging out around there.

19:49.010 --> 19:50.443
Well, who was it?

19:53.210 --> 19:54.779
It's okay, it's okay.

19:54.970 --> 19:57.204
- Nobody'll know it came from you.
- Well, it was dark.

19:57.954 --> 19:59.054
So, you know, uh...

19:59.504 --> 20:03.311
couldn't really see his face.
But he was tall.

20:04.154 --> 20:06.970
- Six, two, six, four?
- Six, four... my God!

20:08.528 --> 20:09.843
Murderuss. I can't swear to that.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.858
I didn't want to say...

20:13.579 --> 20:14.679
You just did.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.861
I had to say something.
Should I call the cops?

20:23.508 --> 20:24.508
All right, uh...

20:24.722 --> 20:26.032
I'll call them right away.

20:26.065 --> 20:28.332
But it was nice to meet
you guys, and good luck.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.464
He's the guy.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.394
Who's... who's the guy? Hodges?

20:34.444 --> 20:36.167
I don't know.
There's something about him.

20:36.329 --> 20:37.329
Another hunch?

20:37.515 --> 20:39.287
Well, we should at least check him out.

20:39.327 --> 20:42.106
Why would he kill Extra Large?
He had no motive.

20:42.288 --> 20:45.940
- None! Extra Large was his meal ticket.
- I don't know.

20:47.523 --> 20:48.623
The limo driver's

20:48.687 --> 20:49.932
out of intensive care.

20:50.307 --> 20:51.538
We can talk to him tomorrow.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.015
Maybe he saw something.

21:07.819 --> 21:08.969
Hello?

21:12.898 --> 21:13.898
Hello?

21:18.554 --> 21:19.720
Who... who is it?

21:30.128 --> 21:31.136
Do I know you?

21:58.879 --> 22:00.063
Mind if I join you?

22:03.589 --> 22:06.811
Randy's upstairs talking
to our medical examiner in rap.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.092
Why?

22:08.447 --> 22:11.418
I learned a long time ago not to
ask Randy why he does anything.

22:12.363 --> 22:14.745
Where's Natalie?
She went home. She's mad at me.

22:14.845 --> 22:17.140
Something about how I never listen or...

22:17.235 --> 22:20.969
I understand you bought her a big bunch
of flowers for Secretaries' Day?

22:21.411 --> 22:22.411
Big mistake.

22:22.660 --> 22:25.630
- They were on sale.
- Monk, that woman would crawl

22:25.697 --> 22:27.737
through hell for you.
She is not your secretary.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.489
I know. They were on sale.

22:32.146 --> 22:34.579
So you gonna come up?
We have a fresh crime scene upstairs.

22:34.723 --> 22:36.573
Yeah, I'll be right up.

22:36.709 --> 22:37.742
You're not gonna like it.

22:38.447 --> 22:40.942
- We found a footprint on the windowsill
- Let me guess.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.128
Special Edition shoe.

22:42.255 --> 22:46.272
The only kind your client
Murderuss ever wears.

22:47.942 --> 22:50.251
- The murder weapon.
- Yeah, let me guess.

22:50.427 --> 22:51.427
White gold.

22:51.862 --> 22:54.344
We found it out back
in the hazardous waste bin.

22:55.794 --> 22:56.794
Of course!

22:56.979 --> 22:59.021
He knew I would never look out there.

23:00.078 --> 23:03.760
Grand jury's meeting tomorrow.
We're gonna indict him on Thursday

23:03.844 --> 23:05.159
and arrest him on Friday.

23:05.297 --> 23:06.680
He is gonna blame me.

23:07.278 --> 23:08.836
I gotta get out of that contract.

23:08.837 --> 23:12.938
- Then get out of that contract.
- Will you...

23:15.077 --> 23:16.077
Will you...

23:16.803 --> 23:17.803
Will you...

23:18.009 --> 23:19.802
Yes, Monk, I will go with you.

23:24.630 --> 23:27.996
- Apologize, but don't cry.
- Don'tcry?

23:28.430 --> 23:29.521
Just tell him the truth.

23:29.788 --> 23:32.571
There's too much evidence against him.
You're not a miracle worker.

23:33.109 --> 23:34.109
Don't do that.

23:34.232 --> 23:35.232
What?

23:35.356 --> 23:36.800
This. It's a gang sign.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.521
Don't do this or this

23:38.858 --> 23:39.858
or this.

23:40.036 --> 23:43.858
- They're all gang signs.
- I'll keep my hands in my pockets.

23:44.467 --> 23:46.400
No, don't do that.
He'll think you're carrying.

23:46.435 --> 23:47.788
He'll shoot us here on the spot.

23:49.398 --> 23:50.643
How... how 'bout this?

23:53.771 --> 23:54.771
Do that.

24:04.273 --> 24:05.323
Killa.

24:05.745 --> 24:06.745
How are you?

24:08.379 --> 24:09.429
He's shy.

24:14.797 --> 24:15.797
Hey, homely.

24:16.942 --> 24:18.342
How... how's it going?

24:18.913 --> 24:20.346
He means homey.

24:20.658 --> 24:22.193
And he doesn't eve mean that.

24:23.093 --> 24:25.343
Um, we'd like to talk to Russell.

24:25.955 --> 24:27.141
What's wrong with your hands?

24:28.572 --> 24:30.155
Just keepin' it real.

24:37.049 --> 24:38.132
Who's your friend?

24:38.755 --> 24:39.807
Leland Stottlemeyer.

24:40.193 --> 24:41.616
- You a cop?
- Yes, I am.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.253
He goes in, you stay out here.

24:46.931 --> 24:47.931
You'll be okay?

24:50.084 --> 24:52.611
- Be right here.
- Uh, Chatty Cathy.

24:53.294 --> 24:54.706
That man's a friend of mine.

24:54.854 --> 24:56.852
I'm holding you personally responsible.

25:50.207 --> 25:51.207
Mm, right on.

25:52.449 --> 25:56.846
- Monk, what it do, baby?
- Murder. Snake. Hello.

25:56.963 --> 25:59.063
I be right with you,
soon as I pass this level.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.957
- Which one are you?
- I'm the one trying to kill that fool.

26:06.277 --> 26:07.294
Why?

26:07.447 --> 26:08.805
It's called gang-banging.

26:08.861 --> 26:10.018
Them two are partners.

26:10.621 --> 26:12.104
Then the white dude got scared

26:12.105 --> 26:13.262
and tried to back out.

26:13.353 --> 26:14.653
I love this game!

26:15.620 --> 26:17.020
You gave me your word.

26:18.337 --> 26:19.337
You wanna play?

26:21.025 --> 26:22.363
I feel like I just did.

26:23.899 --> 26:25.461
Heard about that limo driver.

26:26.208 --> 26:28.405
I suppose I'm gonna get blamed
for that one, too, huh?

26:29.078 --> 26:31.661
He was strangled with a chain,
you know... white gold.

26:32.074 --> 26:33.074
Like this?

26:34.507 --> 26:36.580
It's quite obvious,
somebody trying to set me up.

26:36.941 --> 26:38.512
I'm just glad you in my corner, Monk.

26:38.911 --> 26:43.980
About that, um... I'm, uh, I'm
afraid I have some bad news.

26:44.117 --> 26:45.649
Maybe we could just turn this off.

26:46.177 --> 26:47.177
No.

26:47.299 --> 26:49.632
Okay, first off,

26:49.922 --> 26:52.895
thank you for thinking of me.
I will always cherish

26:53.539 --> 26:56.051
the time we... we've had together.

26:56.099 --> 26:57.659
And that goes for you, too, Killer.

26:58.175 --> 27:01.809
And you, Mr. Assassin.
I think I'll miss you most of all.

27:02.799 --> 27:04.082
Are you goin' somewhere?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.302
I have to... respectfully...

27:08.079 --> 27:09.079
return your money.

27:09.577 --> 27:10.577
You're backing out?

27:11.760 --> 27:13.303
I'm not dissing you.

27:13.475 --> 27:15.142
This... this is not a diss.

27:15.816 --> 27:18.555
Look, man, if you back out right
now, I'm in deep dookie, mookie.

27:18.622 --> 27:21.258
And that's church. Fershizzle my
dizzle. You know what I'm sayin'?

27:21.308 --> 27:25.356
Um... no. Not... not... not so
much. I wish I did. Here's the thing.

27:25.863 --> 27:28.466
When you came to my
house and I said yes,

27:28.882 --> 27:33.277
- that wasn't really me.
- Well, he sure as hell looked like you.

27:33.787 --> 27:35.804
He shook my hand
and he gave me his word.

27:35.971 --> 27:39.682
That should have told you something
right there. I almost never shake hands.

27:39.798 --> 27:45.011
When I get nervous, I say things I
don't mean. Okay? So here's your check.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.248
It's a little wrinkled. I'll just, uh...

27:48.576 --> 27:49.576
No charge.

27:50.448 --> 27:51.553
We're two men, right?

27:52.322 --> 27:53.427
We can work this out.

27:55.877 --> 27:56.877
Check this out.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.592
Wanna hit this peace pipe?

28:00.310 --> 28:01.377
No, thank you.

28:02.243 --> 28:03.655
Come on, man. It'll relax you.

28:03.777 --> 28:05.552
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm... I'm relaxed.

28:05.614 --> 28:07.048
Dog, you are not relaxed!

28:07.486 --> 28:09.967
You got to be the most uptight
little puppy I ever met.

28:10.531 --> 28:13.062
I bet if I put a lump of coal in your
butt and let it sit there

28:13.091 --> 28:14.941
for ten minutes, I could get a diamond

28:15.744 --> 28:20.101
out of it. D- diamond? Murderuss,
listen to me. You gotta believe me.

28:20.875 --> 28:23.122
- That wouldn't work.
- Man, what are you talking about?

28:23.193 --> 28:27.236
There's no way you'd get a
diamond from a lump of coal

28:27.577 --> 28:28.577
up there.

28:28.950 --> 28:31.764
I- It's not physically possible.

28:32.818 --> 28:34.830
Chill out, man.
It's just a figure of speech.

28:34.944 --> 28:35.999
I'll buy you a diamond.

28:36.937 --> 28:38.120
I'll buy you...

28:39.498 --> 28:41.408
I'll buy you all a diamond.

28:43.311 --> 28:47.028
Diamonds for everybody.
Diamonds for everybody.

28:47.429 --> 28:49.695
You heard him, man.
Diamonds for everybody.

28:50.353 --> 28:52.204
Toast to my main man Monk.

28:57.168 --> 29:00.852
I'm the new head of security.
And how did that happen?

29:09.776 --> 29:11.009
Stain remover.

29:11.267 --> 29:12.967
Backup stain remover.

29:13.092 --> 29:14.095
Trudy pillow.

29:14.142 --> 29:16.349
You know, Mr. Monk, running away
never solved anything.

29:16.399 --> 29:18.328
the guy who said that,
about running away...

29:18.435 --> 29:20.091
here's what we know about him.

29:20.150 --> 29:23.675
He didn't keep blacking out and making
deals with a man named Murderuss,

29:23.733 --> 29:26.608
who, by the way, is about to be
indicted for two homicides.

29:27.982 --> 29:28.982
What are those?

29:29.942 --> 29:32.914
Oh, clothes, soap, wipes, water.
Be careful carrying the water.

29:33.090 --> 29:34.882
- Where are you going?
- I haven't decided.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.893
I'm either gonna
buy a rail pass

29:38.071 --> 29:40.381
and bum my way through Central Asia,

29:40.691 --> 29:43.549
or go to your place.
I'm leaning toward your place.

29:43.578 --> 29:45.703
You know, what you obviously
don't care what I think,

29:45.718 --> 29:47.134
and you obviously never will,

29:47.200 --> 29:48.260
but I don't get it.

29:48.331 --> 29:50.777
Why isn't somebody checking out
that guy Denny Hodges?

29:50.844 --> 29:52.061
I told you,

29:52.441 --> 29:55.769
there's no motive. Extra Large
was his biggest star.

29:55.846 --> 29:59.668
It's just weird, okay? The way he
happened to notice Murderuss

29:59.735 --> 30:04.051
near that garage at 7:00.
It's just too convenient.

30:06.589 --> 30:10.025
- He did say 7:00, didn't he?
- Yes.

30:10.415 --> 30:14.138
He was sure about that.
He said he checked his watch.

30:22.129 --> 30:24.093
- Natalie.
- What?

30:25.115 --> 30:27.915
Hodges had to be lying.

30:29.483 --> 30:31.931
But why, why, why would he do this?

30:38.845 --> 30:42.964
I've got it. I've got it. Hodges .

30:43.273 --> 30:46.015
did it. He's the guy.

30:46.351 --> 30:47.401
Which means...

30:47.507 --> 30:49.986
- It wasn't Murderuss!
- It wasn't Murderuss!

30:50.054 --> 30:52.169
Can you believe it? He's innocent!

30:52.341 --> 30:53.360
Who would have thought?

30:53.361 --> 30:55.204
Exactly! He didn't do it!

30:55.367 --> 30:59.584
He's innocent. He's an innocent,
innocent, innocent man!

31:00.505 --> 31:02.902
This is the best
Secretaries' Day ever!

31:05.780 --> 31:06.780
I'm kidding.

31:06.902 --> 31:07.902
I'm kidding.

31:13.221 --> 31:16.604
Check this out. It's a celebration right
now for my homeboy Extra Large.

31:16.745 --> 31:20.287
We miss you, homey. You dig? Yeah.
Put your hands up.

31:20.354 --> 31:23.520

See, it's a celebration

31:45.639 --> 31:48.206
This ain't nothing but a celebration

31:48.304 --> 31:51.072
You see, look, this a celebration...

32:06.428 --> 32:07.428
'Sup?

32:08.407 --> 32:10.170
Hey, homey. You a star yet?

32:11.206 --> 32:12.206
No.

32:14.637 --> 32:17.136
Captain, I heard you about
to make a real big bust tonight.

32:17.183 --> 32:19.613
And you know I wouldn't miss
this for nothing in the world.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.868
That's right. e're just waiting
for the concert to end.

32:21.891 --> 32:22.901
Wasn't me, was it?

32:23.498 --> 32:24.548
I do apologize.

32:24.873 --> 32:26.429
It's all right. It's all good.

32:26.995 --> 32:28.415
And you thought I did it, too, huh?

32:28.677 --> 32:29.865
I admit it. For a while.

32:29.866 --> 32:31.735
I should have listened to Natalie.

32:31.736 --> 32:34.348
Good advice. You should write that
down so you won't forget that.

32:34.672 --> 32:36.287
Would you write that down, please?

32:36.730 --> 32:37.730
Sure.

32:38.287 --> 32:39.896
Now, tell me this, Monk. I wanna know.

32:39.963 --> 32:43.319
How did you solve the case? I want
all the details from start to finish.

32:44.154 --> 32:45.259
Here's what happened.

32:45.278 --> 32:49.110
It's a celebration, yeah I look at y'all
and see a celebration,

32:49.144 --> 32:54.523

33:04.440 --> 33:06.407
In the building. How long
will they mourn me?

33:08.489 --> 33:09.525
You did it, homey.

33:09.627 --> 33:11.421
You a man of your word.
You solved the case,

33:11.422 --> 33:15.778
- I appreciate that. Hey,
- dog, come in here.

33:15.861 --> 33:16.999
He's talkin' about you.

33:19.783 --> 33:22.630
You know, I, uh, I feel
like I lost a brother

33:23.154 --> 33:24.471
on Sunday morning.

33:24.777 --> 33:28.393
I do. And I know that y'all, you know,
feel the same way.

33:28.772 --> 33:29.772
You know?

33:32.015 --> 33:35.437
We know that the police have a suspect.

33:36.145 --> 33:37.480
Y'all know who I'm talking about.

33:37.931 --> 33:39.081
Murderuss!

33:39.131 --> 33:43.309
I ain't gotta say his name. Yeah, you
know what? But let's just be cool.

33:43.366 --> 33:45.283
'Cause if Large was here,

33:45.492 --> 33:48.681
Large would tell us to what...
he'd say just chill out.

33:49.298 --> 33:51.404
So we gonna chill out.
We gonna let the cops

33:51.794 --> 33:53.579
do they job for once.

33:53.953 --> 33:55.170
Speak of the devil.

33:56.537 --> 33:58.015
You got a lotta nerve.

33:58.480 --> 33:59.980
I will give you that.

34:02.267 --> 34:03.340
You know what?

34:03.341 --> 34:04.398
Let's just calm down.

34:04.399 --> 34:05.977
Somebody call the authorities.

34:06.972 --> 34:08.393
Let them know that we have

34:08.393 --> 34:10.022
a murder in the house.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.081
Word.

34:11.264 --> 34:12.264
Word.

34:12.949 --> 34:13.949
Word.

34:14.885 --> 34:16.534
Everybody, word.

34:17.687 --> 34:18.971
People, brothers,

34:19.690 --> 34:22.726
let me give you the 411.
That means information.

34:23.244 --> 34:28.476
Murderuss didn't kill anybody. Denny
Hodges wanted us, wanted everyone

34:28.565 --> 34:33.434
to think that Murderuss planted that
bomb. Hodges said he saw Murderuss

34:33.503 --> 34:35.804
in the parking lot at 7:00 PM,

34:35.972 --> 34:40.969
but that's impossible. The timing device

34:41.091 --> 34:42.491
was a 12-hour clock

34:42.839 --> 34:43.839
like this.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.426
But the bomb went off after 13 hours.

34:50.730 --> 34:55.692
One second, one second. Let... let me
get this straight. Are you accusing me?

34:56.411 --> 35:02.432
This man was family
to me, all right? We was gonna

35:02.468 --> 35:03.686
make each other rich.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.176
Why would I hurt him?

35:05.461 --> 35:10.545
That's what I couldn't figure out...
the motive. But then I realized...

35:10.779 --> 35:14.880
Then I realize... Here's what happened.

35:15.032 --> 35:19.783
Here's what happened.
Word! Here's what happened.

35:22.674 --> 35:23.774
Everybody, word.

35:24.001 --> 35:26.501
Here's what happened, y'all.
I got this, Monk.

35:27.277 --> 35:29.493
Yeah, you can't believe

35:29.519 --> 35:33.302
what you hear all the time.
Sometimes seein' is believing.

35:33.615 --> 35:35.082
Like the man said,

35:35.302 --> 35:36.469
I was set up.

35:37.546 --> 35:39.463
I'm just a pawn in this game.

35:40.710 --> 35:42.247
Let me break it down for y'all.

35:44.108 --> 35:45.241
No, for real.

35:45.675 --> 35:46.927
Here's what happened.

35:47.235 --> 35:49.619
Have you ever been accused,
Man, you got set up

35:49.669 --> 35:52.217
And it really wasn't you,
Man, you got set up

35:52.267 --> 35:54.609
Trying to plant something
on me Man, you got set up

35:54.610 --> 35:58.312
And then you say I killed your
homey This fool was greedy,

35:58.354 --> 36:02.191
had to have the whole thing Let
me run it down to you,it's a cold game

36:02.408 --> 36:06.888
He wanted more than half of the
pie That's why his partner had to die

36:07.014 --> 36:10.748
You heard me,you were the
target all along Am I right,

36:10.814 --> 36:11.881
or am I wrong

36:12.073 --> 36:14.693
You're making a lot
of excellent points.He is.

36:14.818 --> 36:17.906
Every week, they had a breakfast
date Captain Crunch, French toast,

36:17.956 --> 36:22.069
or a stack of pancakes But this
week they wasn't serving nothin'

36:22.086 --> 36:24.347
But murder on the plate

36:30.632 --> 36:32.511
He wanted to pin it on me like a Purple

36:32.570 --> 36:35.486
Heart But his perfect plan just fell
apart as he fled the scene, homes.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.752
Cause like Aaron Burr
who was tried for treason

36:37.787 --> 36:40.259
You made a mistake, dog,
forgot about the season

36:40.835 --> 36:43.749
There was the fatal flaw to
the perfect crime See, Sunday

36:43.779 --> 36:47.505
was daylight savings time Twice
a year we reset the clock

36:47.658 --> 36:51.470
Ahead one hour, but I guess you
forgot Your partner showed up

36:51.506 --> 36:55.590
to break some bread What he found was
an empty table instead You didn't order

36:55.633 --> 36:58.580
room service Cause you thought
the homey Waddy was dead

36:59.760 --> 37:01.450
Extra Large ran outta luck

37:01.553 --> 37:06.354
When the limo came by and picked
him up The pocket watch up under the car

37:06.471 --> 37:09.444
The trigger went boom And
there went Extra Large

37:13.557 --> 37:17.279
Have you ever been accused, Man, you
got set up And it really wasn't you,

37:17.341 --> 37:21.016
Man, you got set up Trying to plant
something on me Man, you got set up

37:21.087 --> 37:22.931
And then you say I killed your homey

37:23.824 --> 37:25.985
I went to the source and
found a great detective

37:26.056 --> 37:29.343
I told Adrian Monk to follow my
direction He solved the case

37:29.415 --> 37:33.983
and rocked it well Next stop for you,
Denny Hodges Is a Death Row jail cell

37:37.561 --> 37:38.805
You dropped your, uh...

37:39.482 --> 37:43.862
You dropped your...
you dropped your mike, Murder.

37:52.808 --> 37:53.818
Hello.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.485
You can't prove any of this.

37:55.486 --> 37:57.430
Au contraire. That's a search warrant.

37:57.911 --> 38:00.664
We just came from your house, Denny.
We found your little bomb making

38:00.714 --> 38:01.855
workshop in the basement.

38:02.724 --> 38:04.092
Lieutenant, take him down.

I wanted to thank you again
personally, man. I appreciate

38:29.878 --> 38:31.068
what you done for me, and, um,

38:31.069 --> 38:33.461
you had me nervous there for a minute.

38:33.859 --> 38:36.421
I couldn't have done it
without my associate.

38:37.598 --> 38:41.051
Assistant/underling. Partner person.

38:41.155 --> 38:43.511
No matter what you call her, man.
She's a beautiful woman.

38:43.595 --> 38:45.635
You lucky to have somebody
like that on your team.

38:46.429 --> 38:49.396
Check it out, dog. I got this big, big,
big tour comin' up.

38:49.469 --> 38:50.736
27 cities.

38:51.016 --> 38:54.511
Big tour buses you know what I'm saying.
Big bright lights. I was wondering

38:54.662 --> 38:58.290
if you wanted to roll and
be my bodyguard/assistant.

39:01.474 --> 39:03.541
Wow! I... thank you.

39:03.869 --> 39:04.869
But I can't.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.096
I'm just so busy.

39:07.675 --> 39:11.356
Wish I could. Damn!
That sounds like fun.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.842
It's cool. Don't even trip. I get it.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.413
But if you change your mind,
you gimme a holler.

39:21.789 --> 39:24.532
It's cool. I gotta skedaddle on
my saddle. I'll holler at you.

39:24.586 --> 39:25.586
Be sweet, baby.

39:25.834 --> 39:26.834
Travel safe.

39:27.768 --> 39:28.768
Truth to power.

39:36.504 --> 39:37.504
Yes, he did.

39:37.628 --> 39:38.628
What did I say?

39:38.751 --> 39:39.751
You said no.

39:40.013 --> 39:41.013
Thank God.

39:41.664 --> 39:43.805
