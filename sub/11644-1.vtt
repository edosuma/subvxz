00:05.120 --> 00:07.589
The storm, the lightning, I don't know -
it's just done something to us!

00:07.680 --> 00:10.593
Something's happened to me, too.
I turned invisible.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.193
Look at me!

00:13.480 --> 00:17.235
- CURTIS: Time went backwards.
- What, you turned back time?

00:17.320 --> 00:19.880
- I've got to have sex with you right now!
- What is happening to me?

00:19.960 --> 00:21.758
Everyone can do something except me.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.434
You killed our probation worker!

00:24.520 --> 00:26.557
If there's no body, there's no crime.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.631
I'm pretty sure this breaches
the terms of my ASBO.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.520
You don't need to use your power on me -
I'm already there.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.079
Do you want to go for a drink with me?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.071
I'm your probation worker.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.878
You were just using me.

he's not allowed to die!

I've got a power!
Ha-ha! Who's laughing now?

01:02.640 --> 01:04.631
Help! I'm alive!

the other probation worker?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.913
Apparently she's missing
or something.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.675
Now, I know this is where
I'm supposed to make a big speech

05:09.760 --> 05:13.879
about you paying your debt to society
and making a difference,

05:13.960 --> 05:17.476

we'd rather be doing.

That's different.

Who are they?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.276
It's an art therapy class.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.192
Er, you mean they're mentals?

05:53.280 --> 05:54.998
D'you want to say that a bit louder?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.959
I don't think that weird-looking one
at the back heard you.

05:58.040 --> 06:03.991
Look, just try and treat them
with some sensitivity and respect.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.718
Yeah?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.269
Even that one.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.275
You think you can manage that?

06:24.360 --> 06:26.749
So, what d'you want us to do?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.030
Well, for starters,

06:30.120 --> 06:32.396
you can paint over that piece of shit.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.391
I can't believe it's you.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.231
I tried to see you
after you'd left the unit.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.716
They wouldn't give me
your phone number.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.599
Didn't you get the letters I wrote you?

07:05.680 --> 07:08.240
No.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.357
Why didn't you visit me?

07:10.440 --> 07:12.909
They said I shouldn't have
any contact with the patients.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.513
I knew it.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.398
I knew you wanted to see me.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.439
I think about you all the time.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.599
Do you think about me?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.354
Come see me tonight.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.636
I'm busy tonight.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.473
You have to come,
there's so much I want to tell you.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.358
Promise me.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.432
OK.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.954
I should go.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.436
I miss you.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.877
It's good to see you.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.957
Well, this is a complete waste of time.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.831

08:48.960 --> 08:50.394
NATHAN: Take it to the edge.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.676
Pull it back, pull it back...

08:54.760 --> 08:58.390
Ah, make it last, you little teasel

08:58.480 --> 09:01.757
OK, crank it up, crank it up!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

09:01.840 --> 09:02.875
Nathan?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.997
You love it, you beautiful bastard!

09:05.080 --> 09:06.150
He's alive.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.713
- He's dead.
- I heard him.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.552
I think he was knocking one out.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.199
That does sound like him.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.237
Maybe you just wanted to hear him.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.789
ALISHA: He's gone.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.197
I'm immortal!

09:50.280 --> 09:52.112
Can you believe this shit?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.511
I told you I had a power. Oh!

09:55.600 --> 09:58.160
Looks like they saved
the best for last, huh?

09:58.240 --> 10:00.231
Immortality. That's off the A-list.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.072
You stupid wanker!

10:02.160 --> 10:03.673
Ow! Stop hitting me!

10:03.760 --> 10:04.750
I thought you were dead!

10:04.840 --> 10:06.558
NATHAN:
I thought I'd never see her again.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.598
So if you're not dead,
how come you smell so bad?

10:09.680 --> 10:12.194
- I appear to have shat myself.
- Eugh!

10:12.280 --> 10:14.112
Were you having a wank in there?

10:14.200 --> 10:18.990
So what if I was? A man can't enjoy
a quick shuffle in his own coffin?

10:19.080 --> 10:21.230
It's not like I was expecting visitors.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.312
And you, you little freak!

10:24.400 --> 10:26.596
What was all that on the roof
of the community centre?

10:26.680 --> 10:28.398
I was trying to save you.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.474
Well, you failed, spectacularly,
didn't you?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.593
I need to eat.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.432
Has anyone got a kebab?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.909
D'you want some chewing gum?

10:42.160 --> 10:43.355
Tutti frutti?

10:43.440 --> 10:45.113
I like it.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.680
Man, that was a bad scene in there.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.149
I thought I was going to
starve to death.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.232
You're immortal,
you can't starve to death.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.516
You're an expert, are you?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.795
So, what are you going to do now?

11:02.880 --> 11:06.032
I should probably go tell my mum
that I'm immortal.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.878

and she's like, "Argh!"

11:24.760 --> 11:26.831
And I'm like, "I'm immortal!"

11:26.920 --> 11:28.240
And then she fainted.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.597
Face plants on the radiator.
There's blood and teeth everywhere.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.715
Is she all right?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.837
Yeah, yeah, she's fine, she's fine.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.560
Apart from the whole...face.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.711
Kinda put a downer
on the whole thing.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.199
How did you explain it to your dad?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.715
I told him I faked my own death

11:43.800 --> 11:45.677
as part of an elaborate
life insurance scam.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.034
He was not a happy man.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.714
Who are you?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.677
I could ask you the same thing.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.239
I'm the probation worker.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.719
Oh. Nathan. Nathan Young.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.598
They told me you were dead.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.193
Really?

12:05.800 --> 12:08.792
Apparently not.
Could a dead man do this?

12:18.080 --> 12:19.195
Oh!

12:19.280 --> 12:21.157
Jesus!

12:21.240 --> 12:24.198
Well, I'll put you back on the system.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.112
Hold on. What?

12:26.200 --> 12:29.431
Are you saying I was out of the system?
I was a free man?

12:29.520 --> 12:31.955
And if I didn't show up here,
no-one would've come looking for me?

12:32.040 --> 12:34.316
We thought you were dead.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.877
CURTIS: You prick.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.074
Where were you?

12:48.160 --> 12:51.551
I waited for you. You promised.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.711
There was something we had to do.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.790
Were you with them?

13:01.400 --> 13:02.834
I should...

13:11.360 --> 13:12.759
Do you know her or something?

13:12.840 --> 13:13.796
No.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.279
Are you trying to shag her?

13:15.360 --> 13:17.636
She's not that mentally ill!

13:17.720 --> 13:18.676
Or maybe she is.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.716
Shut up. She heard that.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.360
Hey, no of fence.
A lot of people say I'm mentally ill.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.796
But obviously I'm not, cos I'm over here
and you're over there...

13:25.880 --> 13:27.678
with the other crazies.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.353
You know what the worst thing is?

14:02.880 --> 14:04.200
What are you doing?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.320
I'm seducing you.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.319
I'm being all...

14:10.400 --> 14:12.118

14:22.600 --> 14:24.477
You're with Curtis.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.119
Guns?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.553
Curtis and me are over.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.074
He didn't satisfy me...

14:33.760 --> 14:36.354
...sexually.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.639
What are you doing?
I don't think you should be doing that.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.996
You shouldn't be doing that.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.555
Hello, big boy!

15:17.680 --> 15:19.353
Catch you later.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.792
(SCREAMS)

16:13.640 --> 16:15.438
So, did you cry at my funeral?

16:15.520 --> 16:18.194
I bet there was loads of girls there
all crying,

16:18.280 --> 16:20.351
wishing they'd shagged me
while I was still alive.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.000
Too late, ladies.
This ship has sailed.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.514
You're such a dickhead.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.352
Oh, I missed you too(!)

16:40.440 --> 16:45.514
I'm no good at this...serious...
girl stuff, and feelings and shit.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.910
I fancy you.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.269
Thanks.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.153
And obviously you fancy me.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.313
So the question is,
when are we going to...seal the deal?

16:59.400 --> 17:02.279
Because I'm thinking
it's going to happen. I know it.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.953
You know it. They know it.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.792
Tonight.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.358
Really?

17:08.440 --> 17:11.637
Just like that?
Me and you are going to...?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.279
You won't regret it.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.240
Alisha.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.910
Alisha.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.759
Alisha!

17:42.840 --> 17:44.638
What?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.154
Do you like food?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.151
Do I like food?

17:48.240 --> 17:50.231
I mean...eating.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.439
We could go for a pizza
and some garlic dough balls.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.838
Are you asking me out?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.910
I think about you.
Not just since you...

18:04.000 --> 18:05.798
You "think" about me?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.117
Have you been wanking over me?

18:12.280 --> 18:14.396
If you want to wank over someone,

18:14.480 --> 18:16.710
wank over Kelly, yeah?

18:16.800 --> 18:18.313
Freak.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.039
Why are you doing this to me?

18:25.840 --> 18:28.673
Oh, hey!
I was just getting some condoms.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.273
You know, for later.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.957
So, are we just doing it the once,
or will we be at it all night?

18:35.040 --> 18:37.156
Should I get two packs?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.918
Depends on how good you are.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.349
What you got down there.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.000
Let's have a look.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.832
Get it out.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.914
Oh. You want to see
the merchandise. I get it.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.991
Try before you buy.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.716
Is that it?

19:04.320 --> 19:05.958
Well, I haven't got another one.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.360
You call that a cock?

19:07.440 --> 19:08.589
What would you call it?

19:08.680 --> 19:12.833
I'd call it pathetic.
I don't shag guys with tiny cocks.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.752
Forget it.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.960
Hey, I have never had any complaints.
Well, maybe a few.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.398
But perhaps it wouldn't be such a problem
if you didn't have such a massive fanny.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.595
What are you talking about?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.557
I'm talking about your jumbo-size twat!

19:39.640 --> 19:41.517
I fucking hate you sometimes!

19:41.600 --> 19:44.114
You started it! I have feelings.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.555
And so does my cock!

20:10.480 --> 20:12.551
Aagh!

20:15.480 --> 20:17.835
Something is going on
with these kids.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.311
Their last two probation workers
have disappeared. They just vanished.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.914
Well, I know these type of kids.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.196
They're annoying, lazy idiots.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.953
They're not murderers.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.792
I want to search the building.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.713
Yeah? Have you got a warrant?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.757
- Do I need one?
- Yes.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.834
I'll get one. You'd better hope
they don't get to you first.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.354
I'm shitting my pants(!)

20:47.120 --> 20:49.270
(LAUGHS)

20:57.160 --> 20:59.310
What's happened?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.953
Alisha!

21:03.040 --> 21:06.032
Alisha, look at me. Look at me!
Who did this to you?

21:06.120 --> 21:07.952
Simon.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.478
- He attacked me.
- What? Why would he attack you?

21:13.560 --> 21:14.914
I don't know.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.877
He's insane.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.158
I'm gonna kill him.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.835
NATHAN: What's going on?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.677
Nothing.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.956
- I should finish you!
- Agh!

22:09.040 --> 22:10.678
I'm sorry!

22:10.760 --> 22:12.592
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you hurt Alisha like that?

22:12.680 --> 22:14.193
I never hurt her...

22:14.280 --> 22:16.794
Don't fucking lie!

22:16.880 --> 22:19.679
Oh, this is going to be interesting.
I want to get comfortable for this.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.990
CURTIS: Why are you fucking
looking at me like that?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.673
What are you doing?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.195
What happened to all the blood?

22:26.280 --> 22:27.793
What?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.109
Did you hit him?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.759
He attacked Alisha.

22:30.840 --> 22:31.796
Er, no, he didn't.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.951
You were in the locker room.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.713
Your face was all messed up.
You said he attacked you.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.199
What are you talking about?

22:37.280 --> 22:41.353
You hit him again, I will kick your balls
back into your stomach, mate.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.829
I think he's been wanking over me.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.319
What?

22:45.400 --> 22:46.356
I haven't!

22:46.440 --> 22:47.760
NATHAN: Well, that's not very convincing.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.629
He doesn't know
Alisha gave me oral sex.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.711
She gave you a blow job?

22:53.800 --> 22:55.120
What?!

22:55.200 --> 22:57.111
I read his mind.
He says that you sucked him off.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.634
What the fuck is going on?

22:58.720 --> 23:02.350
Er, if I was going to suck someone's
cock, trust me, it wouldn't be his.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.590
Aw. Are you going to cry now?

23:04.680 --> 23:06.478
Look, just be straight with us, yeah?

23:06.560 --> 23:08.119
Did she give you a nosh?

23:09.880 --> 23:13.430
Whoever it was that was
sucking your cock, it wasn't me.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.034
Something weird's going on.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.999
Whatever it is,
I'm guessing it's your fault. Jesus!

23:21.280 --> 23:22.509
Oh!

23:31.040 --> 23:32.758
Is that the probation worker?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.037
You killed her?

23:37.120 --> 23:39.111
She was after us.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.953
She was engaged to Tony,
the first probation worker.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.234
She found out about us killing him.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.755
What, so you kill her?

23:48.840 --> 23:51.878
That's brilliant. Problem solved(!)

23:51.960 --> 23:54.839
She was going to the police.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.309
I didn't mean to kill her.
It was an accident.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.754
You're a weird little psycho,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.751
and now everyone knows it.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.073
Don't walk away! This is on all of us.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.799
I thought we were through with this shit.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.349
(TOILET FLUSHES)

24:15.440 --> 24:20.913
<i>Oh...</i> I don't know what is
going on with my guts.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.914
It's all hot cross buns and Easter eggs
when Jesus gets resurrected.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.320
That wasn't Nathan?

24:26.400 --> 24:29.995
Whoever it was, they know
we killed our probation workers.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.435
Did someone kill our probation worker?

24:34.960 --> 24:39.431
Seriously? I spend a few hours
in the toilet and I miss all that?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.431
Life is just passing me by.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.911
- Who was that just now?
- I think it's a shape-shifter.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.914
They can take on other people's
appearance.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.753
I saw it in an episode of Star Trek.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.275
We should probably watch
more of that science fiction and stuff -

24:54.360 --> 24:56.556
might actually figure out
what's going on round here.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.870
So that wasn't you
who said those very hurtful things

24:58.960 --> 25:02.157
- about the size of my cock?
- What? No!

25:02.240 --> 25:07.997
Oh. Then you're probably wondering
why I said you had a...

25:08.080 --> 25:09.991
huge fanny.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.879
There may have been a bit of a mix-up.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.960
We should set up a password
that we can say to each other

25:17.040 --> 25:19.554
- so we know it's us.
- "Monkey slut".

25:19.640 --> 25:21.711
We're not having "monkey slut"
as a password.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.792
What are the chances of that being used
in a normal conversation?

25:24.880 --> 25:28.555
- Kinda low, no? -
- Just go with it. "Monkey slut".

25:35.240 --> 25:37.117
We need to find out who it is
before they go to the police.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.273
It's the new probation worker.
It's always the probation worker.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.034
That dead chick was
the other probation worker's fiancée.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.270
What if this new one's his brother?

25:46.360 --> 25:50.877
- He's white. Tony was black.
- Er, adopted brother?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.871
Adopted kids are nut-jobs.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.597

25:59.680 --> 26:02.149
- Or it could be her.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.994
Well, I will see you tomorrow.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.912
Yeah, good one. Very convincing.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.320

26:14.760 --> 26:17.320
- Kelly!
- You think you can dick around with us?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.196
Change back into your fuckin' self!

26:25.280 --> 26:26.873

26:26.960 --> 26:30.476

She's dead.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.639
Oh, fuck.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.796
We killed him.

27:24.880 --> 27:29.238
Look, you had to do it. OK?
She was going to kill me!

27:29.320 --> 27:31.789
You're immortal!

27:31.880 --> 27:36.033
I thought she'd turn back into herself
when she died.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.073
There's no way
that's actually the probation worker.

27:44.160 --> 27:48.199
- Right?
- I think it might be.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.639
Can we please stop killing
our probation workers?

28:11.120 --> 28:14.590
NATHAN: That dead chick was the other
probation worker's fiancee, right?

28:14.680 --> 28:16.876
What if this new one's his brother?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.917
He's white. Tony was black.

Well, you're obviously lying.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.560
But it's five o'clock
and I couldn't give a shit.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.753

29:35.800 --> 29:38.394
So what's the story
with you and this girl?

29:38.480 --> 29:42.189
After I tried to
burn that boy's house down...

29:44.720 --> 29:47.553
...they sent me
to a psychiatric unit for assessment.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.392
Really? I can't imagine why(!)

29:53.160 --> 29:55.071
Lucy was a patient in the unit.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.714
I think she's obsessed with me.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.713
So it's just that and the murder, is it?

30:00.800 --> 30:02.837
Or is there anything else
you'd like to share with the group?

30:02.920 --> 30:05.799

after how you've treated me?

- It looked like her.

- It wasn't her.
- It had her mouth.

- What?

36:17.360 --> 36:18.919
If you're you, rewind time.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.877
You know it doesn't work like that.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.470
I'm going to find Curtis.

36:36.720 --> 36:40.076
- What do we do with her?
- There's only one thing we can do.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.273
- That's pretty brutal.
- We can't kill her.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.237
She knows too much.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.833
Stop!

38:09.800 --> 38:12.599
They've turned you against me.

38:15.080 --> 38:18.391
I know what I need to do now.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.759
You're going to
walk into the police station

38:22.840 --> 38:27.073
and confess to murdering
your probation worker.

38:27.160 --> 38:30.516

40:18.920 --> 40:21.275
I know how much it hurts.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.517
I thought they wouldn't be friends with me
if they knew about me being in the unit.

Do you really think they're going to be
friends with someone like you?

What, you'll have to get a job

- We finish our community service.

- What are you going to do then?
- I'm going to join the circus.

stick swords in me, shoot me in the face.

is because you're all fucking idiots!

cos I weren't even there!
