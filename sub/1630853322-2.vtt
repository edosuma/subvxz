00:03.240 --> 00:05.559
'You're listening to
Coast Radio South. It's Friday.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.039
'It's just coming up
to five o'clock,

00:08.040 --> 00:10.519
'and the weekend starts,
quite literally, here.

00:10.520 --> 00:14.359
'It's nearly home time.
We've got news on the hour.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.280
'But before that, we've got a little
traffic and weather check...'

02:25.640 --> 02:28.439
BUTTON CLICKS

02:28.440 --> 02:30.359
LIFT CLANKS

02:30.360 --> 02:33.199
GRINDING

02:33.200 --> 02:34.719
PANICKED BREATHING

02:34.720 --> 02:36.479
LOUD CLANKING

02:36.480 --> 02:39.200
WHIRRING

03:33.240 --> 03:37.639
It's going to take the whole weekend
to get her free of the silt.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.919
Her?

03:38.920 --> 03:40.719
The male skeleton
is generally more robust,

03:40.720 --> 03:44.119
and the proportions are different.
The hyoid is broken.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.279
The small, U-shaped bone
that keeps the tongue in place.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.399
Strangulation?
Textbook.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.999
Presence of the wisdom teeth
tells us she is over 17.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.839
I'd put her between 25 to 40.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.319
Any idea how long she's been here?

03:58.320 --> 04:00.479
There's evidence
of some dental work.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.919
White fillings,

04:01.920 --> 04:05.479
which tend to have been more
common over the past three decades.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.920
But there's a cap on one maxillary
incisor which looks more recent.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.040
Last ten years, maybe?

04:15.280 --> 04:19.160
Looks like someone's career's
going down the sewer, eh?

04:22.840 --> 04:26.199
It's a storm drain for the
old Brighton to Kemp Town railway.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.319
It was built to stop
water flooding the line.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.919
And nobody knew it was here?
Well, that's planning for you.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.239
People forget.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.679
Now, the line links
the city's sewerage system,

04:34.680 --> 04:37.279
which discharges
a mile or so out to sea.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.599
So if the pathologist
is saying foul play,

04:39.600 --> 04:42.439
then, presumably, the killer
put the body down the drain

04:42.440 --> 04:44.199
expecting the same thing to happen.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, but they hadn't considered it
not flooding the drain.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.479
Oh, Christ.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.360
Good luck, boss. Here comes Pepe.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.039
Evening, Roy.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.439
Cassian.
I wasn't expecting you till Monday.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.919
Allie Vosper suggested I drop by.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.639
Well, it's very kind of her,
but, erm...

05:03.640 --> 05:06.159
it'll be slow work until Monday.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.759
You got all the CSIs
and search officers you need?

05:08.760 --> 05:11.519
I have. Thank you.
No Glenn Branson?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.199
Usually Me And My Shadow
with you two, isn't it?

05:14.200 --> 05:18.439
Or is he still on light duties
after getting shot?

05:18.440 --> 05:20.039
Wedding anniversary.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.279
I'm sorry you've had
a wasted journey.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.119
If you'd given me a call,
I could've saved you the bother.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.079
Never a bother, Roy.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.040
Pleasure. Always.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.560
Sergeant.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.719
You know what Hughie Green
would've said?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.799
"If you can't spell Cassian Pewe,

05:40.800 --> 05:43.640
"just write down 'pompous shitehawk'
and we'll know who you mean."

05:45.040 --> 05:46.520
Unbelievable.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.320
PANICKED BREATHING

06:01.440 --> 06:02.680
SHE EXHALES

06:11.880 --> 06:14.199
FRANTIC PRESSING

06:14.200 --> 06:16.800
BANGING

06:23.560 --> 06:25.039
Help!

06:25.040 --> 06:26.560
Hello?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.719
BANGING
I'm stuck! I'm in the lift!

06:30.720 --> 06:32.599
Help!

06:32.600 --> 06:35.999
Somebody help!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.120
Am I the love of your life?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.719
Mm-hm.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.760
Am I, Grace?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.039
You are.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.199
You're not lying to me, are you?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.319
You're so needy.
SHE LAUGHS

06:51.320 --> 06:53.439
You're so boring!

06:53.440 --> 06:55.199
We're on a romantic weekend away,

06:55.200 --> 06:57.359
and you've got your nose
stuck in whatever it is.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.879
Annual crime report. It's important.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.119
Oh, and I'm what?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.719
Work, work, work.
Read, read, read.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.719
Just so boring, boring, boring!

07:07.720 --> 07:10.679
What's up?
Pay attention to me.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.279
Come on, Dobbin. Giddy-up!

07:12.280 --> 07:15.119
Once around the Great Hall.
Mm.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.199
"My Sex Pest Hell,
by Top Brighton Cop."

07:18.200 --> 07:20.400
SHE LAUGHS SOFTLY

07:33.200 --> 07:34.640
HE CRIES OUT

07:37.560 --> 07:39.320
HE EXHALES

07:41.680 --> 07:43.680
Oh...
Hey... Hey...

07:45.880 --> 07:47.839
It's OK.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.600
You're OK.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.560
Yeah, sorry. Er...

07:59.280 --> 08:01.120
Do you want to talk about it?

08:04.560 --> 08:07.080
It's not...
It's not good to keep it inside.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.360
If not to me, then someone.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.960
Glenn, whoever.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.880
Is it work?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.680
Yeah.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.639
I-I'm OK.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.120
Sorry I woke you.
Mm.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.719
DNA samples from the hair
and a bone sample from the thigh

08:54.720 --> 08:56.679
have been sent for analysis.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.279
I'm no orthodontist,
but four fillings.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.319
Three white composite,
one gold inlay.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.879
An all-porcelain bridge
from upper right six to four.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.440
But this is interesting...

09:08.880 --> 09:12.559
I might be wrong, but I think
lab analysis will tell us

09:12.560 --> 09:14.559
that this is carpet fibre.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.240
Too hard to be from a pullover
or a skirt or a cushion cover.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.879
Where did you find it?

09:20.880 --> 09:24.039
Artificial nail. From a nail bar.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.879
A plastic compound, glued on.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.079
Somehow, the nails
didn't get to be washed away

09:29.080 --> 09:31.319
while the skin beneath rotted.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.759
The fibre
was beneath the middle finger.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.639
It could be that her assailant
dragged her along a carpet

09:36.640 --> 09:38.959
and she dug her nails in.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.240
SCREAMING

09:43.880 --> 09:46.480
Bit of luck
that it didn't get washed away.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.959
So, what did I miss?
Anything from the site to go by?

09:53.960 --> 09:56.199
Search is continuing,
but nothing as yet.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.999
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.919
Whatever went in there with her,
if there was anything at all,

10:00.920 --> 10:03.199
has long since washed away.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.999
Hey, your old mate Cassian Pewe

10:05.000 --> 10:07.160
gets his boots under the desk today,
doesn't he?

10:09.040 --> 10:11.520
GRACE EXHALES
That's what's up, isn't it?

10:12.920 --> 10:14.639
You're not right.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.439
Sandy had a tooth capped.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.679
Roy...

10:17.680 --> 10:19.599
Same height. Same build.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.119
It's not her.
Same hair colour.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.399
Come on...
Same age.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.879
Roy, no. Stop, OK?

10:24.880 --> 10:28.439
You can't keep imagining that
every Jane Doe is gonna be Sandy.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.719
You can't do it.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.839
You really think that's not how
it is every time I get called out?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.199
Every time the phone rings
in the middle of the night?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.199
It's the last thing I think of
when I go to sleep,

10:37.200 --> 10:39.039
and the first thing
I think of in the morning.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.679
Is today the day?
Roy...

10:40.680 --> 10:43.640
Is today the day that I find Sandy?
Roy.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.880
Look, I'll, er...

10:57.200 --> 10:58.680
Erm...

11:00.320 --> 11:03.399
Darren's had to...
cry off his shift.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.320
Right.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.879
So I'm going to be on call tonight.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.120
Sure.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.080
We should probably talk.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.840
Yeah. Course.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.239
I'm gonna book off for an hour.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.879
I'll see you back on the shop floor.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.559
Hey.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.720
You all right?
Yeah.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.640
Yeah, there's just something
I need to take care of.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.200
LOUD CLANKING

12:01.880 --> 12:03.880
CLUNK,
ALARM RINGS

12:05.160 --> 12:07.079
MAN: Can you hear me down there?

12:07.080 --> 12:08.800
MEN GRUNTING

12:10.800 --> 12:13.279
There. You all right, love?
You all right in there?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.799
Don't worry, you're safe, pet.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.679
You've had a weekend of it,
haven't you?

12:17.680 --> 12:19.319
Come on.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.920
That's it.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.599
Roy.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.879
I've just been welcoming Cassian
to the team.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.879
Since you'll have your hands full
with this body in the storm drain,

13:17.880 --> 13:19.679
I'd like Cass to start his time here

13:19.680 --> 13:21.560
by looking through
your cold case files.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.839
I have...

13:24.840 --> 13:27.439
quite a particular system in place,
Ma'am.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.440
Which you can explain to Detective
Superintendent Pewe, I'm sure.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.159
Thank you, Cassian. That'll be all.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.999
Ma'am.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.480
Roy.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.159
The Met is the biggest and most
innovative police force in the UK.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.480
I think we can learn something
from Cassian. Such as?

13:52.480 --> 13:55.039
Off the top of my head...

13:55.040 --> 13:57.999
how to run an operation
that doesn't leave Branson shot

13:58.000 --> 14:00.720
and Boutwood with
possible career-ending injuries.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.560
You don't think your methods
leave room for improvement?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.399
I don't want a personality clash.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.640
If you two can't get along...

14:13.000 --> 14:14.280
Ma'am.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.039
Last in, first out, isn't it?
Traditionally.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.839
You know me, Roy.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.040
I was never one for tradition.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.960
PHONE RINGING OUT

14:55.360 --> 14:57.439
'Hello?'
Hi, Mum. It's me.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.319
'Abby?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.599
'Oh, this is a good line.
I can hear you ever so clear.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.399
'Where are you? You still in Spain?'

15:05.400 --> 15:07.559
No, Mum. South of France.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.839
You're all right?
'Oh, yes.'

15:09.840 --> 15:11.319
Seen anyone?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.559
'Me? No!

15:13.560 --> 15:17.119
'No-one's been near nor by.
Which is how I like it.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.759
'You're all right, are you?'

15:19.760 --> 15:23.919
Yeah, I'm all right.
'How's that fella of yours, Harry?'

15:23.920 --> 15:27.079
Horry, Mum. He's fine.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.239
Nobody's called you?

15:29.240 --> 15:32.399
'Called me? Who's gonna call me?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.239
'I don't know anybody.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.279
'The only calls I get are about
a car accident I've never had.'

15:38.280 --> 15:41.800
I tell them I can't drive any more.
Doesn't seem to stop 'em.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.799
Nothing outside of that?
Nobody asking about me, or anything?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.039
'About you?'

15:48.040 --> 15:49.759
No.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.800
Where are you?
You still in Spain, are you?

15:54.240 --> 15:55.680
No, Mum.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.519
South of France.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.840
'And how's that fella of yours,
Harry?'

16:04.080 --> 16:05.719
Horry.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.840
He's good, Mum. He's good.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.759
Listen, that Clerwell House
I told you about...

16:13.760 --> 16:16.679
They've got a beautiful room with
a view of the river coming free.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.799
I've reserved it.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.839
'Where are you
gonna get the money for that?'

16:19.840 --> 16:22.119
Don't worry about that.
I'm taking care of it.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.760
Once it's all settled,
I'll come over and help you move in.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.639
'All right.
Well, I won't run your phone up.'

16:29.640 --> 16:33.040
My programme's coming on.
Him with the antiques.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.119
OK, Mum. All right,
well, I'll call you soon, OK?

16:38.120 --> 16:40.680
You take care.
'Love you.'

16:42.360 --> 16:43.920
Love you, too.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.879
ROY: What you got, Nick?

16:56.880 --> 16:59.839
This is a list of all missing
persons in the county of Sussex

16:59.840 --> 17:02.600
who fall into the estimated
time period of the victim's death.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.839
Everything all right?

17:06.840 --> 17:08.839
Yeah. It's just...

17:08.840 --> 17:10.840
the list includes your wife.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.639
And so it should.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.639
OK, where are we with the sewer
and the storm drain?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.199
There's a few entry points.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.399
The council sewer team
are drawing us up a schematic.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.599
The outlet goes far enough
out to sea to ensure all sewage

17:25.600 --> 17:28.679
gets transported offshore by
the current, rather than towards it.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.039
Presumably, that's what
the killer was banking on.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.439
Could be an engineer, then?
Someone who knows the system.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.999
The storm drain for the
Brighton to Kemp Town railway's

17:37.000 --> 17:39.199
not part of the sewerage system,
as such.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.039
Most people wouldn't
even know it's there.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.399
That line's been out of service
for donkey's.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.359
Trainspotters, maybe?
Urban explorers?

17:46.360 --> 17:50.079
We'll get a lot further
once we've put a name to her.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.920
PHONE ALERT

18:07.920 --> 18:10.040

MAN: Miss Jennings?

18:30.960 --> 18:33.679
It's Kevin Spinella,
Brighton Argus. Er...

18:33.680 --> 18:37.679
I wanted to talk to you
about your terrible ordeal.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.239
Stuck in a lift for the weekend?

18:40.240 --> 18:44.079
No, sorry. I really
don't wanna talk about it.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.800
Miss Jennings?

18:48.600 --> 18:50.640
Miss Jennings?

19:30.640 --> 19:34.839
'With regard to the body found
in the storm drain on Friday last,

19:34.840 --> 19:38.119
'although we can't be certain
as to the cause of death...'

19:38.120 --> 19:41.639
whoever murdered her
would probably have had

19:41.640 --> 19:45.079
a good local knowledge
of Brighton and Hove.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.639
We're obviously very keen
to identify the victim.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.399
'At the time of her decease,

19:50.400 --> 19:55.239
'she would have been
mid-to-late 30s.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.599
'Height approximately

locally,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.599
who went missing
in the last ten years,

20:10.600 --> 20:16.439
can reach me or a member of my team
here at East Sussex House.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.240
Thank you.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.439
PHONE RINGING OUT

20:32.440 --> 20:33.519
'Express Send Couriers.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.199
'Jonathan speaking.
How can I help you?'

20:35.200 --> 20:38.239
I have a package I need delivered.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.519
'Certainly. Let's just start
with a few details.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.239
'What time would you like
your package picked up?'

20:43.240 --> 20:45.799
'Around seven tonight, please.'

20:45.800 --> 20:49.919
I sent her dental profile
to a number of Brighton practices.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.279
Got lucky.

20:51.280 --> 20:55.040
Her name is - or rather, was -
Joanna Welbeck.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.719
Single or married?
Married.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.839
She was an actress.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.319
Don't know the full story yet,
but they split up,

21:05.320 --> 21:09.159
and she went to Los Angeles
to, you know, make her name.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.119
Or so the husband told everyone.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.519
Sounds like we should have a chat
with Mr Welbeck.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.439
That'd be a bit one-sided.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.879
He died in a plane crash
seven years ago.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.039
Light aircraft
went down in the Channel

21:20.040 --> 21:22.439
on a private charter flight
from Jersey.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.559
Although, given the crowd
he was running with,

21:24.560 --> 21:27.360
there's talk
it might not have been accidental.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.600
Mrs Balkwill?

21:39.560 --> 21:42.279
Detective Superintendent Pewe,
East Sussex CID.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.839
I wonder if I might have a quick
word with you and your husband?

21:45.840 --> 21:47.760
It's about Sandy.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.239
I've been brought in from the Met
to review cold cases in East Sussex.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.999
And...

22:03.000 --> 22:05.599
I don't think
your daughter's disappearance

22:05.600 --> 22:07.560
has been adequately investigated.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.280
In what way?

22:12.320 --> 22:15.879
Well, normally,
when a wife goes missing,

22:15.880 --> 22:19.319
the husband
is instantly the prime suspect.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.919
But it doesn't seem
that your son-in-law

22:21.920 --> 22:24.240
was ever formally regarded as such.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.399
Are you saying
that's what you think now?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.879
Not at all.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.919
But I think radical steps
need to be taken

22:32.920 --> 22:35.199
to eliminate him from suspicion,
and...

22:35.200 --> 22:36.999
I mean to take them.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.600
For everyone's sake.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.200
Would you say Sandy's
was a happy marriage?

22:47.280 --> 22:51.039
Well, she had to put up with
being on her own a lot.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.639
And being disappointed
at the last minute

22:53.640 --> 22:55.599
when he got called out for work.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.919
I mean,
you must have a bit of that too.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.360
Oh, I'm not married, Mrs Balkwill.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.439
We...

23:05.440 --> 23:08.160
don't think that Roy is a suspect.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.039
Y-You mustn't go
jumping to the wrong conclusions.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.799
This is merely about closure.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.799
Enabling you and your husband

23:18.800 --> 23:20.760
to move on with your lives.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.759
And, of course, hopefully...

23:24.760 --> 23:27.680
clearing Roy's name,
once and for all.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.040
Thank you.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.399
Now, there was very little
wreckage recovered,

23:37.400 --> 23:39.279
but what there was indicated

23:39.280 --> 23:42.999
that the aircraft was subject
to a sudden catastrophic event.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.919
What do you mean, like...
What, like a bomb?

23:44.920 --> 23:46.199
Yeah. Or a lightning strike.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.279
See, it was a very stormy night.
But there was no mayday sent.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.839
It was just there one minute
and gone the next.

23:51.840 --> 23:56.119
Speculation was that it most likely
exploded and broke up in mid-air.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.639
What about bodies?

23:57.640 --> 24:00.519
Never recovered.
Ronnie Welbeck, nor the pilot.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.719
Now, they found
some personal property,

24:02.720 --> 24:03.919
and a shoe of Ronnie's

24:03.920 --> 24:06.319
that indicated he was on the plane
when it went down.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.359
Now, his wife, Lorraine,
identified it all as his.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.679
Lorraine? So he... remarried?

24:12.680 --> 24:14.599
Yeah, looks that way.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.479
All right.
Well, let's try and track her down.

24:17.480 --> 24:21.439
In the meantime, what information
do we have on Joanna Welbeck?

24:21.440 --> 24:24.679
Any family we can talk to?
No. Parents are deceased.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.599
Same as Ronnie Welbeck.
Yeah, well, Ronnie had previous.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.719
First time on the radar was '97.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.839
He worked for a dodgy
second-hand car dealership,

24:32.840 --> 24:36.359
clocking cars and knocking out
cut-and-shuts with Sean Klinger.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.119
Sean "The Snowman" Klinger, eh?

24:38.120 --> 24:40.279
Brighton and Hove's
very own Escobar.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.919
Yeah, well, him and Ronnie
started out working together.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.679
Then they got into
a bunch of trouble

24:44.680 --> 24:46.279
over a bunch of clocked cars,

24:46.280 --> 24:48.239
and the business
disappeared overnight.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.919
The entire garage burned down,
with all the records.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.600
12 months, suspended.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.080
DOOR BUZZER

25:07.480 --> 25:09.440
Come on up. Seventh floor.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.120
KNOCK AT DOOR

25:35.760 --> 25:37.200
SHE GRUNTS

25:39.800 --> 25:41.799
SHE GASPS FOR BREATH

25:41.800 --> 25:43.240
Nice to see you, Abb.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.200
Not mad about the new look.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.399
'Just a few questions about the late
Ronnie Welbeck, Mr Klinger.'

26:19.400 --> 26:21.559
You were close, I understand.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.919
Well, I knew him.
What about Joanna, his first wife?

26:24.920 --> 26:27.119
Yeah, I knew both of 'em.
Jo and Lorraine.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.399
What was Jo like?

26:29.400 --> 26:33.639
Ex-lap dancer. Nice arse. But...

26:33.640 --> 26:36.039
volatile. That's the word, isn't it?

26:36.040 --> 26:38.799
I find you often get that,
with the highly-sexed sorts.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.279
Dynamite under the duvet,

26:40.280 --> 26:43.039
but an absolute liability
in any kind of decent company.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.079
In what way?

26:44.080 --> 26:46.559
She'd let her mouth
run away with her in drink.

26:46.560 --> 26:50.079
Ronnie'd tell her to tone it down,
next thing it's a screaming match.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.759
Nobody wants that.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.279
Did he ever hit her?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.799
Never saw him give her a proper dig.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.439
Would he have been capable
of killing her, do you think?

26:58.440 --> 27:01.359
We're probably all "capable",
aren't we?

27:01.360 --> 27:03.519
But it's sort of academic now,
isn't it?

27:03.520 --> 27:05.200
And how's that?

27:06.680 --> 27:09.599
Well, when Jo realised that Ronnie
didn't have the Midas touch,

27:09.600 --> 27:11.519
she left him.
Went off to the States.

27:11.520 --> 27:15.759
Human remains found in a storm drain
in the centre of Brighton on Friday

27:15.760 --> 27:18.999
have been identified
as Joanna Welbeck.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.679
She'd been there a long time.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.639
I'm shocked.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.959
And you think Ronnie did it?
It's an avenue of enquiry.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.959
What about his second wife?

27:27.960 --> 27:29.919
Lorraine?
Hmm.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.159
Now, she could have
the top off the milk any morning.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.639
Fantastic tits.
Sold timeshares abroad.

27:35.640 --> 27:39.999
But Ron and I had kind of dropped
out of each other's orbit by then.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.359
What do you mean?

27:41.360 --> 27:44.719
Well, people come and they go,
don't they?

27:44.720 --> 27:46.919
Were you in touch with Ronnie
when his plane went down?

27:46.920 --> 27:49.639
No. I sent a wreath
with my sincere condolences,

27:49.640 --> 27:52.119
but when Ronnie died, I hadn't
seen him for a couple of years.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.119
What about the rumour that
it might not have been accidental?

27:55.120 --> 27:57.559
That there might have been
a bomb on board?

27:57.560 --> 27:59.799
Well, in general,
I try not to increase

27:59.800 --> 28:03.599
the sum total of nonsense in the
world by repeating baseless rumour.

28:03.600 --> 28:07.959
What was he doing in Jersey?
I've really no idea.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.680
Where can we find Lorraine?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.199
Well, you won't.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.639
Unless you've got a boat
and a deep sea diving suit.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.999
She topped herself.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.159
Stepped off the Newhaven to Dieppe
ferry one night.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.879
About a year after Ron died.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.959
Summer 2016? Round then.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.159
Besides yourself,
who were Ronnie's closest mates?

28:26.160 --> 28:29.719
He was pretty tight
with a guy called Chad Skebbs.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.119
But he emigrated to Spain.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.639
Anyway, as I said,
I only had ten minutes, so...

28:35.640 --> 28:38.200
Sorry.

28:44.360 --> 28:48.520
Now, why would you want to courier
old newspapers in a Jiffy bag?

28:50.680 --> 28:52.959
Unless it was to make somebody
keeping an eye on you

28:52.960 --> 28:56.119
think you'd sent
something else altogether.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.079
Enjoy your weekend?

28:58.080 --> 29:01.319
I thought with you safely boxed up,
I'd be able to get into the flat

29:01.320 --> 29:02.799
and give it a proper going over.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.279
But you've got it locked down

29:04.280 --> 29:07.520
tighter than a camel's arse
in a sandstorm.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.719
Still...

29:10.720 --> 29:13.080
gave you a little fright, eh?

29:17.760 --> 29:20.680
Where are they, Abb. Hmm?

29:21.840 --> 29:22.920
Nope.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.600
No.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.399
No.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.880
I'm gonna ask you some questions
and you're gonna answer. Yes?

29:33.800 --> 29:34.840
Yes?

29:38.120 --> 29:39.680
So, are they here?

29:41.800 --> 29:45.000
OK, are they in Brighton?

29:52.800 --> 29:57.280
In a safe-deposit box maybe?

29:58.480 --> 30:00.000
Look what I found.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.239
I wonder if I might have a word
about Roy Grace?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.119
Hmm.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.840
Off the record.

30:16.800 --> 30:21.239
You know, in the last seven years,
the only officer to review

30:21.240 --> 30:25.240
the investigation into
his missing wife is Roy himself.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.959
Now, this is no criticism
of East Sussex and, of course,

30:28.960 --> 30:31.439
it pre-dates your appointment but...

30:31.440 --> 30:33.959
that would never
have happened in the Met.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.840
What are you saying?

30:37.760 --> 30:43.199
Well, erm, her parents feel that
nobody at East Sussex Police

30:43.200 --> 30:45.919
carried out
an impartial investigation.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.439
And what do you think?

30:47.440 --> 30:50.479
Well, I just want to make sure
we've done everything possible

30:50.480 --> 30:52.040
to put their minds at rest.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.760
Hmm.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.199
So one wife sets off to America,

30:58.200 --> 31:00.119
ends up in a storm drain
in Brighton.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.639
The second jumps off
a cross-Channel ferry.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.119
Oh, well, I guess some people
are just unlucky in love, eh?

31:06.120 --> 31:10.319
According to US authorities,
there's no record of Joanna Welbeck

31:10.320 --> 31:13.679
ever having entered the
United States on any documentation.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.119
No surprises there, then.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.279
So Ronnie kills her,
dumps her in the storm drain,

31:17.280 --> 31:19.879
and then tells everyone she left him
and ran off to Hollywood.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.479
Lorraine Welbeck, second wife,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.159
is still officially recorded
as a MISPER.

31:25.160 --> 31:29.000
We've a sister for a next of kin.
Maureen. Lives in Newdigate.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.319
So Ronnie's death must have come

31:33.320 --> 31:35.919
as a great shock to your sister,
Miss Finton.

31:35.920 --> 31:41.279
Lorraine was in a terrible state.
Depressed. Suicidal.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.919
Well, obviously.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.599
He left her in a right mess,
financially, with his debts.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.599
When did she meet Ronnie?
About eight years ago.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.839
He was looking for a place
in the South of France

31:54.840 --> 31:58.159
as an investment,
and that's where they met.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.439
She sold timeshare, is that right?

32:00.440 --> 32:04.159
Well, it was more
just overseas property.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.119
Undeveloped plots of land people
could build on. That sort of thing.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.199
Spain. France.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.000
Jersey?
A little bit, I think.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.799
And did they have anywhere abroad,
if Ronnie was looking?

32:17.800 --> 32:20.959
Not that I ever knew.
What was Ronnie doing in Jersey?

32:20.960 --> 32:22.919
That last trip, do you know?

32:22.920 --> 32:25.759
He had some business there,
Lorraine said.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.159
His stamps, maybe.
Stamps?

32:28.160 --> 32:30.199
What was that, a hobby?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.760
More of a business, really.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.159
One night in the pub he showed me
this stamp out of his wallet

32:37.160 --> 32:40.359
he paid 50 grand for.
All wrapped in tissue.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.439
I said, "Don't put that on a letter,
will you?"

32:42.440 --> 32:45.960
Was he insured, do you know?
Oh, I expect so.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.839
Not that Lorraine saw any of it.
His creditors were all over her.

32:50.840 --> 32:56.160
When they cleaned her out, she just
sort of retreated into a shell.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.719
Ended up in a wee rented flat
down Montpelier Road.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.759
To be honest, I think that's what
put her over the edge.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.959
That come-down.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.279
And... losing Ronnie, of course.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.160
So eight years.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.280
Ronnie would still have been
married, when he met your sister.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.759
Lorraine said
he wasn't getting on with her.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.399
His first wife. Joanna, was it?

33:25.400 --> 33:28.359
He thought there might've been
another man.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.400
And then she just walked out on him.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.559
We should talk to
the overseas property firm

33:39.560 --> 33:40.919
that Lorraine worked for.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.079
See if Ronnie Welbeck ever did find
his investment.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.039
What, you reckon
he's got somewhere abroad?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.239
It's possible, isn't it?

33:46.240 --> 33:48.159
If he was trying to keep
his finances hidden.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.120
You know much about stamps?
First or second class?

33:52.520 --> 33:53.879
Look, I'll have a ring round.

33:53.880 --> 33:56.279
See if we can find any dealers
that remember him.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.639
We should check out
the life insurance as well.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.120
See how much debt he left her with.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.479
SHE GRUNTS

34:06.480 --> 34:07.959
DOOR OPENS

34:07.960 --> 34:09.439
SHE WHIMPERS

34:09.440 --> 34:12.080
I suppose you think
you're very smart.

34:14.040 --> 34:16.239
Lock it all away
in a safe-deposit box

34:16.240 --> 34:18.920
that requires iris recognition
to open it.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.999
How about I cut your eye out
and take that with me,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.839
see if it recognises that?

34:25.840 --> 34:28.959
If not,
I'll come back for the other one.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.279
Of course, if that doesn't work,
then we're both stuffed.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.079
You'll be blind,
and I'll be no better off.

34:33.080 --> 34:36.240
But you know that, don't you? So...

34:41.960 --> 34:43.560
What would get you to play ball?

34:45.360 --> 34:47.679
ABBY ON RECORDING: 'That
Clerwell House I told you about.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.799
'It's got a beautiful room with
a view of the river coming free.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.039
'I've reserved it.'

34:52.040 --> 34:54.319
ABBY'S MUM: 'Where are you
gonna get the money for that?'

34:54.320 --> 34:56.679
'Don't worry about that,
I'm taking care of it.'

34:56.680 --> 34:58.919
"Don't worry about the money, Mum."

34:58.920 --> 35:01.159
That's what I like about you, Abb.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.120
You're all heart.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.560
Talk to me.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.400
DOORBELL RINGS

35:26.240 --> 35:29.159
I'm sorry. It was a bad weekend.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.559
There were similarities
between the skeleton and...

35:32.560 --> 35:34.199
Sandy.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.599
The dental work. And the age.
And the hair colouring.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.800
And then Nadiuska found
the blue carpet fibres...

35:40.160 --> 35:43.280
The bedroom rug is...
Yeah, I know. I've seen it.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.599
Come in? I don't really want
a back and forth on the doorstep

35:48.600 --> 35:49.960
like we're in a Richard Curtis.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.280
I can't imagine what it's like to
lose someone the way you lost Sandy.

36:00.040 --> 36:04.159
But then... you can't imagine
what it's like being with someone

36:04.160 --> 36:07.039
who has lost someone
the way you lost Sandy.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.399
If that's still a thing for you,
then...

36:09.400 --> 36:11.160
It isn't.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.399
She's gone.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.119
And she's not coming back.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.640
But if she did?

36:19.320 --> 36:21.120
She's not going to.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.480
There were only ever
two possibilities.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.559
She can't come back,

36:27.560 --> 36:29.359
or she won't come back.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.839
And if it's the former,
then me or somebody like me

36:33.840 --> 36:36.079
will get to the bottom of it.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.199
But I accepted a long time ago

36:39.200 --> 36:42.359
that I might never find out
what happened.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.920
And if she won't come back?

36:46.440 --> 36:48.999
Then I'll know that
it's me she left

36:49.000 --> 36:51.119
and that no harm's come to her.

36:51.120 --> 36:55.680
And I hope more than anything...
that that's the case.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.519
And that thing that
you said to Glenn,

37:00.520 --> 37:02.919
about always thinking
the next call-out

37:02.920 --> 37:04.960
will be the one that finds her...

37:06.480 --> 37:08.599
There's not really anything
I can do about that.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.880
Why didn't you say something?

37:13.600 --> 37:15.200
Because I didn't want...

37:17.960 --> 37:20.240
..something that happened
in my life...

37:22.360 --> 37:23.680
..to change...

37:25.800 --> 37:27.720
..how we are with each other.

37:29.720 --> 37:34.080
To let it define
whatever comes next.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.520
Then you have to be honest.

37:41.680 --> 37:47.640
Nothing that means anything
can ever grow out of secrets.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.880
Try anything clever
and your mum's dead. Got it?

38:29.120 --> 38:31.000
Maybe a little smile.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.119
INTERCOM BEEPS

38:35.120 --> 38:38.359
'Southern Deposit Security.'
Katherine Jennings.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.799
I want to access
my safe-deposit box.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.720
'Of course. Come in.'

39:27.680 --> 39:30.120
Far end, on the right.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.039
Come on, what you doing?
I feel sick.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.879
I haven't eaten anything
in 24 hours.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.120
I just need to catch my breath.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.839
Wait...

40:09.840 --> 40:11.360
Eastbourne, please.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.760
PHONE VIBRATES

40:32.040 --> 40:33.879
'I can hear you breathing.'

40:33.880 --> 40:36.280
Better make the most of it.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.999
We are now able to put a name
to the human remains

40:51.000 --> 40:55.319
discovered in the New Laines Quarter
of the city on Friday evening.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.479
They are those of Joanna Welbeck.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.239
At the time of her disappearance,

41:00.240 --> 41:04.519
Joanna was married
to a Ronnie Welbeck,

41:04.520 --> 41:07.799
who died some seven years ago
in a plane crash.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.279
Is he your prime suspect in this?

41:10.280 --> 41:12.279
My team are pursuing a number

41:12.280 --> 41:14.759
of promising lines of enquiry,

41:14.760 --> 41:20.039
although, I would urge anyone who
knew Joanna to please come forward.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.959
Thank you.

41:21.960 --> 41:25.280
Detective Superintendent,
can I have a quick word?

41:27.040 --> 41:29.959
Of course, Mr Spinella.
Er, it's nothing to do with this.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.399
Just something that I thought
I ought to mention.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.599
I got a call from a contact
with the fire brigade, Monday.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.999
They had a shout to Embassy Court
in town for a young woman

41:39.000 --> 41:41.199
stuck in a lift.
Slow news week?

41:41.200 --> 41:42.879
Er, she'd been there
since Friday night.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.719
Thing is,
I felt something wasn't right.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.599
Her building supervisor
reckoned that vandals must have

41:48.600 --> 41:51.519
broken in to the lift motor room and
tampered with the brake mechanism

41:51.520 --> 41:53.959
and the electrics. He found
a couple of syringes in there.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.879
She was unlucky.
Sure.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.279
But what he wasn't able to explain
was why the alarm system,

41:58.280 --> 42:01.399
which should have rung through
to his flat, failed to do so.

42:01.400 --> 42:05.279
Or why her front door was fitted
with more locks than Fort Knox.

42:05.280 --> 42:08.319
If I didn't know better, I'd say
she was frightened of something.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.760
Or someone.

42:39.720 --> 42:45.319
Katherine Jennings, Flat 120,
Embassy Court, Kings Road, Brighton.

42:45.320 --> 42:46.599
I know we're up to our ears,

42:46.600 --> 42:48.519
but maybe swing by,
see if everything's OK.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.999
Just to be on the safe side.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.599
I know Spinella's
a pain in the arse,

42:51.600 --> 42:53.719
but even a stopped clock
and all that.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.319
Could be a domestic issue?
Abusive boyfriend.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.919
Yeah, well, if she's in trouble,
I don't wanna miss it.

42:58.920 --> 43:02.319
Hi. I've got a step-brother
for Joanna Welbeck.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.959
Goes under the stage name
of Mitzi Dufors.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.879
Member of Brighton and Hove's
thriving and vibrant

43:07.880 --> 43:10.199
LGBTQ+ community.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.119
OK.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.720
We've got cocktails for two
this afty.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.359
I spoke to the property company
Lorraine Welbeck worked for.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.279
There was a plot of land that Ronnie
was interested in at the time,

43:21.280 --> 43:22.999
not too far from Biarritz.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.559
Did he go through with it?

43:24.560 --> 43:27.639
Er no, no, he didn't, but it was
acquired shortly thereafter

43:27.640 --> 43:30.999
on behalf of an unknown client
from a firm called

43:31.000 --> 43:32.959
Cape Trafalgar Holdings.

43:32.960 --> 43:35.079
The name stuck
with the French office, apparently.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.559
I can see why it might. And?

43:37.560 --> 43:39.359
Well, I've asked the locals
to take a look,

43:39.360 --> 43:41.639
but from the paperwork
I managed to track down,

43:41.640 --> 43:44.559
Cape Trafalgar Holdings
was a sole trader outfit.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.679
Its, er, owner was
a David Irvin Nelson.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.159
Registered office
is a PO Box in St Helier.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.159
Any connection with that
and what, er,

43:52.160 --> 43:54.039
Ronnie Welbeck was up to in Jersey?

43:54.040 --> 43:56.959
A friend in the NCA says
Ronnie Welbeck was running gear

43:56.960 --> 43:59.399
in and out of the island
on behalf of Sean Klinger.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.599
There's talk Welbeck
was skimming more off the top

44:01.600 --> 44:04.319
than Klinger might have been
prepared to put up with.

44:04.320 --> 44:07.919
So what are we saying,
Klinger brought the plane down?

44:07.920 --> 44:10.560
Well, it's certainly the suspicion.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.079
# You don't have to stay forever

44:38.080 --> 44:40.279
# I will understand

44:40.280 --> 44:42.479
# Believe me

44:42.480 --> 44:46.319
# Believe me

44:46.320 --> 44:51.839
# Believe me. #

44:51.840 --> 44:55.399
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:55.400 --> 44:58.159
Very nice, your Dusty.
Thanks.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.719
Do you do any others?

44:59.720 --> 45:02.839
When the wind's in the right
direction, I do a mean Ann-Margret,

45:02.840 --> 45:05.039
not that there's much call for her
these days.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.559
No, I meant any more
Dusty Springfield tracks?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.759
Oh. You're a fan.
Who isn't?

45:09.760 --> 45:11.719
Ah, well, Preacher Man, of course.
Aye.

45:11.720 --> 45:14.200
Dusty In Memphis
is an absolute classic.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.279
You didn't come here
to talk about Dusty.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.239
No. No.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.800
You mentioned something about
a photo of Joanna.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.919
I'll want it back.

45:26.920 --> 45:28.400
Yeah, course.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.719
When was this taken?
Around the last time I saw her.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.519
London Olympics, maybe?

45:34.520 --> 45:36.839
More recent than anything we've got,
so...

45:36.840 --> 45:39.359
Um, you're her step-brother,
then, is it?

45:39.360 --> 45:40.839
Half-brother.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.839
Our father left my mum
to take up with Joanna's mother.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.679
And the old man died when
she was ten, so I kept an eye.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.439
Got the odd phone call,
maybe at Christmas,

45:49.440 --> 45:52.039
but she had her life and I had mine.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.279
Next thing I heard is she was
getting married to Ronnie.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.839
Did you ever meet him?
Once or twice.

45:56.840 --> 45:59.199
It was money this, money that.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.439
I just thought he was dodgy.
Well, they all were.

46:02.440 --> 46:04.679
Who's all?
His mates.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.119
Villains. But she was happy enough.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.839
To begin with, at least.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.519
And then what, it all went off?

46:11.520 --> 46:13.319
I think she was after an out
for a while.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.759
And there was this fella
sniffing around.

46:15.760 --> 46:18.359
What fella?
Pal of Ronnie's.

46:18.360 --> 46:22.280
I can't remember his name.
Chas, was it? Chet, maybe?

46:23.400 --> 46:25.239
Right, was she having an affair?

46:25.240 --> 46:27.039
I did wonder if it was him
she'd gone off with.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.279
You see, when her mother died,

46:28.280 --> 46:30.079
she left her this little place
in Brentwood.

46:30.080 --> 46:33.319
When was that?
About six months before she went.

46:33.320 --> 46:37.319
I heard on the grapevine via Ronnie
that she'd gone to LA.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.799
So I thought she must've
used the money from the house

46:39.800 --> 46:41.639
to fund going to America.

46:41.640 --> 46:44.159
And you didn't hear
anything from her after that?

46:44.160 --> 46:47.800
I didn't really expect to. Not
if she'd gone off with a new fella.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.919
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
So it's mixed roses. Red and white.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.920
And that's delivered to Ari Branson
in the Radiology Department.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.079
Yeah. No, this afternoon's great.
Cheers.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.360
Thanks a bunch. Thank you.
Bye-bye. Bye.

47:03.160 --> 47:04.919
HE SIGHS

47:04.920 --> 47:06.719
Bit early to be making amends,
isn't it?

47:06.720 --> 47:09.999
Haven't you just come back
from a romantic weekend away?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.360
Don't tell me you've
blotted your copybook already.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.240
You know I said it went fine?

47:18.560 --> 47:21.319
It didn't go fine, did it?
Nope.

47:21.320 --> 47:22.999
No, it did not go fine.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.160
I mean, you tell me, what is
so wrong with a tandem skydive?

47:27.600 --> 47:31.719
OK, how about,
A, you're scared of heights,

47:31.720 --> 47:34.119
and B, you hate flying.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.199
Apart from that,
no, yeah, it's perfect.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.119
That's the thing. I'm not.

47:38.120 --> 47:41.279
I'm not scared of heights.
Not any more.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.639
Since when?
I don't know. But it's just...

47:44.640 --> 47:45.919
It's just gone.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.239
I don't know how to describe it.
I mean...

47:49.240 --> 47:51.399
What's that thing that people say?

47:51.400 --> 47:53.280
"Feel the fear and do it anyway."

47:54.640 --> 47:57.759
I mean, once, even just being
up high, my legs would just go,

47:57.760 --> 47:59.359
right, just turn to jelly.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.240
Now? Well, now it's like...

48:03.480 --> 48:05.400
It's like I'm, I'm over it.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.519
And that's, that's gotta be
a good thing, though, right?

48:10.520 --> 48:11.640
Maybe.

48:13.080 --> 48:16.559
Although, sometimes fear is
the only thing that keeps us alive.

48:16.560 --> 48:20.119
In this job anyway.
Fools rush in and all that.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.480
Maybe try and lay off the needless
heroics for the time being.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.280
Speaking of fools...

48:33.000 --> 48:36.400
..has Cassian Pewe
redecorated your office yet?

48:37.440 --> 48:40.000
All right, go on. What is it?
What is it with you two?

48:42.640 --> 48:47.439
One time, the Met sent down
reinforcements to help us out

48:47.440 --> 48:49.279
with the Labour Party conference
in town.

48:49.280 --> 48:52.399
Pewe was a DI.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.519
He ended up nicking
a couple of informants

48:55.520 --> 48:58.999
that I'd been cultivating
for several years.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.319
He refused to drop charges.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.119
So I took it to Vosper,

49:04.120 --> 49:07.440
and she sided with the
blue-eyed boy down from the Smoke.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.839
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.360
PHONE VIBRATES

49:15.720 --> 49:16.839
Bella?

49:16.840 --> 49:19.319
The lift mechanism's
been tampered with.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.559
Sabotaged,
according to the engineer.

49:21.560 --> 49:24.159
Someone interfered
with the brake mechanism

49:24.160 --> 49:25.439
when the lift was in operation.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.199
And the alarm and phone cables
were cut.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.119
And what did Miss Jennings say?
'Nothing yet.'

49:30.120 --> 49:33.279
She's a new tenant, apparently.
Short let.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.719
Lives on her own
and only goes out after dark.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.239
Where is she now?

49:37.240 --> 49:39.719
Last seen earlier today
leaving the building with a man.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.440
Caretaker says she's single.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.079
Nick about?
No.

50:18.080 --> 50:20.359
I did see him talking to old
Cassian Pewe at his desk

50:20.360 --> 50:22.399
just before lunch.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.879
What did he want?
Your guess is as good as mine.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.319
Did you want him
for anything in particular?

50:27.320 --> 50:30.079
Yeah, I asked him to run a PNC
on that known associate of Welbeck's

50:30.080 --> 50:32.319
that Klinger mentioned. Chad Skebbs.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.279
He asked me to do it.
Full name - Richard Skebbs.

50:34.280 --> 50:35.799
Turns out he's
wanted in connection

50:35.800 --> 50:39.359
with an allegation
of indecent assault, from 2014.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.439
Didn't Klinger say
that Skebbs went abroad?

50:42.440 --> 50:43.679
Spain, wasn't it?
'DS Moy.'

50:43.680 --> 50:46.879
I think you'll find
the correct term is "fled".

50:46.880 --> 50:48.359
Roy.

50:48.360 --> 50:50.519
Spinella. Line three.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.280
Says it's important.

50:57.200 --> 51:00.159
Mr Spinella.
We're looking into Miss Jennings.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.519
Thank you for the tip-off,

51:01.520 --> 51:03.559
we've got nothing official to say
at this time.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.279
Er, actually, it was you
I was calling about.

51:06.280 --> 51:09.479
I wondered if you had any comment
about what's going on at your house?

51:09.480 --> 51:11.439
My house?

51:11.440 --> 51:13.239
Well, if you don't know
anything about it,

51:13.240 --> 51:15.319
maybe you should get over here.

51:15.320 --> 51:17.040
I'll be outside.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.360
You all right?

51:41.040 --> 51:42.920
I'll be with you in a minute.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.999
What the fu...

51:57.000 --> 51:58.480
Nick...

52:00.480 --> 52:03.039
What the hell is this?
GPR.

52:03.040 --> 52:07.519
Ground penetrating radar.
I... I assumed you had OKed this.

52:07.520 --> 52:08.600
OKed what?

52:10.280 --> 52:12.999
Nick?
I've got a search warrant.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.079
Is this a joke?

52:15.080 --> 52:17.240
Who requested the warrant?

53:14.080 --> 53:16.359
How dare you?!

53:16.360 --> 53:18.199
What, this?

53:18.200 --> 53:20.399
CSI crawling all over my home.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.519
Taking soundings
in my back garden

53:22.520 --> 53:25.079
for the body you think
I have buried there.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.639
Call it off. Now.

53:26.640 --> 53:29.239
I'm sorry. But having spoken
to Margot and Derek...

53:29.240 --> 53:31.279
You spoke to Sandy's parents?

53:31.280 --> 53:34.319
Allie Vosper asked me
to take over your backlog.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.679
And Sandy's was the first case
you turned up, was it?

53:37.680 --> 53:40.999
She remains a cold case, Roy.
You're telling me that?

53:41.000 --> 53:44.039
There isn't a stone
I have left unturned.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.440
SCOFFS

53:46.480 --> 53:50.879
Psychics? Cranks and mind readers?
End-of-the-pier fortune-tellers?

53:50.880 --> 53:52.479
If you'd lost somebody you'd loved,

53:52.480 --> 53:56.319
you would know that there is nothing
you wouldn't do to get them back!

53:56.320 --> 53:59.360
No matter how unlikely.
How do you know what I'd do?

54:00.840 --> 54:04.319
But I'll tell you this, I wouldn't
turn it into a three-ring circus.

54:04.320 --> 54:09.279
I was cleared of any involvement in
Sandy's disappearance. Exonerated.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.999
Not to the standard that
we would've applied in the Met.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.799
The Met? Really?

54:13.800 --> 54:17.880
Well, as we all know,
they're infallible, aren't they?

54:37.040 --> 54:39.959
Ronnie Welbeck's life insurers
finally got back to me.

54:39.960 --> 54:42.879
The pay-out
was three million pounds.

54:42.880 --> 54:46.079
Three months
before she stepped off that ferry,

54:46.080 --> 54:49.119
Lorraine withdrew the entire amount
in cash.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.879
She died in poverty, with
nearly three million in the bank?

54:51.880 --> 54:53.759
Except the money wasn't in the bank.

54:53.760 --> 54:55.879
Ronnie and Lorraine Welbeck's
joint account

54:55.880 --> 54:57.839
shows an ever-increasing overdraft,

54:57.840 --> 55:00.159
with just occasional
small amounts coming in.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.199
Yeah, we knew they had money issues.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.079
Yeah,
right up until the day he died.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.839
But an account was opened
in Lorraine Welbeck's sole name

55:06.840 --> 55:08.519
nine months after Ronnie was killed.

55:08.520 --> 55:10.719
For the life insurance, presumably?

55:10.720 --> 55:14.199
Yeah, but I don't understand
how it was paid out that fast.

55:14.200 --> 55:17.319
Well, the insurance company assigned
to the case weren't entirely happy,

55:17.320 --> 55:20.679
but the Drugs Squad investigation
suggested there was another dealer,

55:20.680 --> 55:22.119
possibly French,

55:22.120 --> 55:24.719
who wanted to give Klinger
a message to keep off his turf.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.559
They blew the plane up?

55:26.560 --> 55:28.999
Using Ronnie as collateral.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.959
Well...

55:30.960 --> 55:34.679
that to one side for the minute,
is there some sort of pattern here?

55:34.680 --> 55:38.279
Look, Ronnie Welbeck's
first wife inherits money,

55:38.280 --> 55:41.799
disappears to the States
and ends up in a storm drain.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.839
Then his second wife inherits money

55:43.840 --> 55:45.439
and ends up
at the bottom of the Channel.

55:45.440 --> 55:50.039
So what're you saying, she didn't
commit suicide? Somebody killed her?

55:50.040 --> 55:51.799
I'm just what-iffing.

55:51.800 --> 55:53.879
PHONE BUZZES
Couldn't've been Ronnie, then,

55:53.880 --> 55:55.879
because he died in that
plane crash or bombing

55:55.880 --> 55:58.279
or whatever it was
a year before Lorraine died.

55:58.280 --> 56:00.999
Yeah, but what about his mate,
Skebbs?

56:01.000 --> 56:04.159
Mitzi Dufors said one of Ronnie's
mates was sniffing around Joanna.

56:04.160 --> 56:08.199
Couldn't remember the name, but
it was something like Chas or Chet.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.959
Hmm. Not too much
of a stretch to Chad, is it?

56:10.960 --> 56:14.799
Well, I've been doing some digging
around Richard "Chad" Skebbs.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.559
And it seems that it wasn't
in the public interest

56:17.560 --> 56:19.399
to follow him to Europe.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.319
He thought they'd fled to Albania,

56:21.320 --> 56:24.599
but he's last been seen in Spain
and southern France.

56:24.600 --> 56:25.919
Keep digging.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.479
I've got a lead
on a guy called Hector Hegarty.

56:29.480 --> 56:32.600
He's a stamp dealer, remembers
doing business with Ronnie Welbeck.

56:50.640 --> 56:53.559

57:02.720 --> 57:05.639
I thought you were still away.
I wanted to surprise you.

57:05.640 --> 57:08.400
Oh, Mum. I've missed you so much.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.279
So much.
Ohh!

Detective Superintendent Pewe.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.759
'This is DS Franks from Interpol.'

57:24.760 --> 57:26.679
How can we help you?

57:26.680 --> 57:29.599
'I believe you asked
our colleagues in France to look at

57:29.600 --> 57:32.560
'a development sight for you.
Is that correct?'

57:44.920 --> 57:47.919
Oh, yes, I did a fair bit of
business with Ronnie over the years.

57:47.920 --> 57:50.919
He wasn't the easiest person
to deal with. In what way?

57:50.920 --> 57:53.439
Well, you know. To put it crudely,

57:53.440 --> 57:57.359
the provenance on some of his stuff
was doubtful, shall we say?

57:57.360 --> 57:59.079
What about his second wife?

57:59.080 --> 58:02.040
Did Lorraine Welbeck ever contact
you after her husband's death?

58:03.360 --> 58:07.279
I don't suppose it matters now.
But she had me swear to secrecy.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.039
Well, a murder inquiry trumps

58:09.040 --> 58:11.800
any word you might have given,
Mr Hegarty.

58:14.120 --> 58:17.199
She came to see me, spring 2016,

58:17.200 --> 58:18.959
wanted to invest
some money in stamps.

58:18.960 --> 58:22.199
Can you remember the sum involved?
Not offhand.

58:22.200 --> 58:24.919
But any big order draws attention
in the stamp world.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.159
She wanted it done quietly
and discreetly.

58:27.160 --> 58:30.119
So I fronted the purchases for her.
Spread the money around.

58:30.120 --> 58:32.799
Said I was buying
for an anonymous collector.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.199
Can you provide us with a list

58:34.200 --> 58:36.399
of all the stamps
that you sold to Mrs Welbeck?

58:36.400 --> 58:38.279
And the value.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.319
Give me a little time
to consult my records.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.959
Could you also give us
a list of anyone

58:42.960 --> 58:44.959
who might have been able
to afford them,

58:44.960 --> 58:47.359
if she'd wanted to sell them on?

58:47.360 --> 58:49.919
I can give you the dealers,
and a few individual collectors

58:49.920 --> 58:51.879
like myself.
Course, back then, round here,

58:51.880 --> 58:55.079
there was a chap Ronnie knew well
himself, but he went abroad.

58:55.080 --> 58:56.959
Who was that?

58:56.960 --> 58:59.799
Richard Skebbs. Called himself Chad.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.599
Always dealt in big numbers.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.519
Still does,
but all done over the internet now.

59:04.520 --> 59:08.399
And did you ever buy from him?
Oh, once bitten...

59:08.400 --> 59:12.359
I bought some Spanish Civil War era
stamps from him. Did me right up.

59:12.360 --> 59:14.839
They weren't in anything
like the condition he had promised.

59:14.840 --> 59:17.039
When I complained,
he told me to sue him.

59:17.040 --> 59:20.120
Frankly,
I'm amazed he's still in business.

59:21.880 --> 59:24.999
What's going on, Ab? What is it?

59:25.000 --> 59:28.079
I may be getting forgetful,
but I'm not stupid.

59:28.080 --> 59:29.879
You're frightened.

59:29.880 --> 59:33.159
It's just someone who wants me
to go out with 'em.

59:33.160 --> 59:35.519
He's trying to get to me
through you. That's all.

59:35.520 --> 59:39.799
What's your fella doing about it?
Nothing, Mum. He's not here.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.439
Why isn't he?
It's complicated.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.759
The taxman's after him.

59:43.760 --> 59:46.359
And if he comes into the country,
he could get picked up.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.479
Doesn't sound like
much of a boyfriend.

59:48.480 --> 59:51.160
A man ought to take care
of the woman he loves.

59:52.760 --> 59:54.679
Hi, I need some new locks
at my mum's flat.

59:54.680 --> 59:57.840
'Right.'
And a safety chain and a spyhole.

1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:21.719
Lorraine Welbeck's name
is on a Post-it on my desk.

1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:23.479
"DS Franks"?

1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:27.079
Ah, yes. This location you've asked
the French to take a look at.

1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:31.639
What's this? It's to do with the
body in the storm drain, Ma'am.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:34.359
Remains of
an unidentified, pregnant woman

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:37.159
were found in the boot of a car
pulled from a lake on the property.

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.839
It's been there for some years.

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:41.639
They've obtained DNA
from her and the foetus,

1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:44.639
but they haven't been able to make
any matches on their database.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:47.319
Where does Lorraine Welbeck fit in?

1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:50.239
Lorraine Welbeck is the second
wife of Ronnie Welbeck, Ma'am.

1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:52.999
She was working
for the estate agent

1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:54.999
that sold the plot of land
in France.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.679
Oh, it's rather more than that, Roy.

1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:02.239
The corpse in the boot of the car
had silicone breast implants.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:04.679
Now, you may not know this,

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:08.199
but they're all printed with
the manufacturer's batch number.

1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:09.799
This particular pair was supplied

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:12.759
to a cosmetic surgery hospital
in Woodingdean in 2015.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:14.879
So I called them.

1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:17.759
They matched the implants
with the name...

1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:19.559
Lorraine Welbeck.

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:21.799
That's excellent.

1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:23.520
Don't you think so, Roy?

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:29.479
What are we saying, Lorraine
Welbeck swam the Bay of Biscay

1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:32.079
with three million quid stuffed
between the Devil's dumplings?

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:34.879
Doesn't seem very likely.
Probably not, Norman.

1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:37.759
But she was four months pregnant.

1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:40.159
The French
have no paternal DNA match,

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:44.119
but we're checking our database, we
should hear back later or tomorrow.

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:46.999
Anything on cause?
Strangulation.

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.239
Same as Joanna Welbeck.

1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:52.959
Did we get any further on the owners
of this plot of land in France?

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:56.439
Cape Trafalgar Holdings
and this elusive David Nelson?

1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:57.839
No. Nothing.

1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.680
At least we know that Lorraine
Welbeck didn't commit suicide.

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:05.279
Run a check on the
passenger manifest for the ferry

1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:07.999
on the night
that she supposedly jumped.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.599
What am I looking for?

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:12.559
Anything out of the ordinary.
Chad Skebbs, maybe?

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:15.679
Mitzi Dufors said he was
sniffing around Joanna Welbeck.

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:18.839
And she came into money
shortly before she disappeared.

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.920
So could he have been behind the
bomb on Ronnie Welbeck's plane?

1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:24.959
So he kills Ronnie Welbeck

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:29.199
and he's waiting to catch Lorraine
Welbeck and Ronnie's life insurance.

1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:32.279
Yeah, possibly.
So, where's the money?

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:35.079
There's not gonna be room
for three mil in the bazooka bag

1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:38.199
if it's already stuffed with
bought-and-paid-for silicone norks.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.479
Did he really
just say that out loud?

1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:43.759
I don't think it was cash, Norman.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.039
'When Ronnie Welbeck's plane went
down, he died leaving massive debts.

1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:51.559
'Every penny he left to Lorraine
had been taken by his creditors,

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:53.759
'and their house repossessed.

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:55.759
'Before she got on that ferry,

1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:58.599
'Lorraine Welbeck converted
her husband's life insurance

1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:01.600
'into something
much easier to transport...

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:08.440
'..and far easier to conceal.'

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:24.760
Oh, my God!

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:27.680
Are you all right?

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:31.559
A man who hates me

1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:34.439
is trying to convince
the people that I work with

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.360
that I killed my wife. So...

1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:40.479
You said to be honest.

1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:42.960
Hmm. Is there anything I can do?

1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:47.080
Unless you're a dab hand
with carpet grippers...

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.760
Do you want to talk about it?

1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.000
Do you?

1:03:57.360 --> 1:03:59.119
Maybe not tonight.

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:02.399
Maybe tonight is exactly
the right time to talk about it.

1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:05.080
I'm not about
to kick a man when he's down.

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:11.440
If I've got to be honest...

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.040
SHE SIGHS

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:18.440
All right.

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:22.840
I just keep thinking...

1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:28.879
..what if she walked
through the door right now?

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:31.000
Where does that leave you and me?

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.360
It's not gonna happen.

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:40.520
See, erm...

1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:44.080
..that's not the answer.

1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:49.919
The answer is,
"It wouldn't matter, Cleo.

1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:53.160
"She walked out on me seven years
ago. And I'm with you now."

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:02.720
Call me when you're through...
with all of this.

1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:17.200
DOOR CLOSES

1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:30.360
DOORBELL RINGS

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.359
Hello?

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.359
MAN: Mrs Morton?
Yes.

1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:39.520
Silverlight Lockworks.
Your daughter Abby called.

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:45.280
Come in.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.119
You called, Mr Hegarty?

1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:55.999
I've just had a phone call
from a rather nervous young woman.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:59.759
She asked if I'd be able to sell
a collection of high-value stamps.

1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:01.559
When I asked for details,

1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:06.239
she described exactly the stamps
I purchased for Lorraine Welbeck.

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:09.479
Are you sure? If I hadn't
gone through my files today,

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:12.279
I doubt I'd have realised
they were such an exact match.

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:14.879
Did you ask her where she got them?

1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:17.959
She said she inherited them from
a woman she looked after in Spain.

1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:20.239
Somebody she'd met
at a party there told her

1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:21.799
she'd get a better price in the UK

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.759
and I was one of the dealers
she should talk to.

1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:27.959
She's coming in this afternoon
to show me the stamps.

1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:29.400
What's her name?

1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:34.120
Miss Jennings? Police.

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:38.600
Open it.

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:45.200
Miss Jennings?

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:54.760
Nice quiet hobby, eh,
stamp collecting.

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:08.920
Mum?

1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:12.960
PHONE RINGS

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:18.519
'Abbs. It's me. It's Mum.'

1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.679
Mum?

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:22.799
Mum, where are..
where d'you get a mobile?

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:27.280
Ricky wants to talk to you.
Please do what he tells you.

1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:30.959
Hello, Ab.
Where's my mum?

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:33.599
Where is she, you bastard?
Where is she?

1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:35.919
She's fine. So far.

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:37.559
I'm calling the police.

1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.599
Look, I don't care about
anything else any more.

1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:41.039
'What're you going to say to them?'

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:42.559
"I stole everything this man had

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.319
"and now he's caught up with me
and taken my mother hostage?"

1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:48.279
What, I stole from you?
You and himself, obviously.

1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:50.599
Was there any position
he didn't tell you to shag me in

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:52.039
to get what you wanted?

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:55.159
This has got nothing to do
with my mum, Rick. She's not well.

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:58.039
Look, just bring her here
and we'll talk.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:00.959
No. You bring me everything
you nicked and then we'll talk.

1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:02.679
Look, I meant what I said.

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:04.519
I'm hanging up now
and calling the police.

1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:07.159
You do that, and all they're gonna
find is a chronically ill woman

1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:09.279
who's committed suicide,
and her daughter,

1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.399
a self-confessed thief
with a cock-and-bull story

1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:15.559
about a man she stole from.
Is that really what you want?

1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:17.119
BEEPING

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:18.640
Rick!

1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:24.359
So I've been going through the
passenger manifest for the ferry

1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:26.399
that Lorraine Welbeck
didn't step off.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.839
It seemed to me, if you're
leaving one identity behind,

1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:32.159
it makes sense to have another one
lined up. Right?

1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:34.119
You mean, she got on the boat
as Lorraine Welbeck

1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:35.959
and stepped off as someone else?

1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:38.399
So I went through all the other
women passengers travelling

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:40.079
on a single ticket
and I compared them

1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:41.799
to anyone travelling on from Dieppe.

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:44.399
I found one passenger
who got on an Air France flight

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:47.199
within an hour of the ferry docking.
Where to?

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:51.199
San Sebastian. Hold on.
So she got on the ferry to Dieppe,

1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:55.479
and then within an hour she got
on a plane from there to Spain?

1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.279
Why not just fly direct from the UK?

1:08:57.280 --> 1:08:59.439
Name?
Margaret Nelson.

1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:02.759
Only, her ticket was paid for
by one David Nelson.

1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:07.719
Ah, the same David Nelson
of Cape Trafalgar Holdings maybe?

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.759
So what're we thinking? Maybe
David Nelson is Ronnie Welbeck?

1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:12.359
More than maybe.

1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:15.239
I also have a David Nelson
who got on a flight to Madrid,

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.639
then on to San Sebastian
from Jersey,

1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:21.119
the morning after Ronnie's light
aircraft disappeared in the channel.

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:23.719
So Ronnie Welbeck
fakes his own death

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:25.639
in order to escape his creditors.

1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:28.279
And Lorraine converts
his life insurance into stamps

1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:31.039
in order to fund her new life
in Spain.

1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:33.959
Isn't that where Chad Skebbs
went off to? Potentially.

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:36.479
But where Lorraine was found
just outside of Biarritz,

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:39.320
well, that's half an hour
from the Spanish border.

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:44.399
Which is an hour to San Sebastian.

1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:47.439
Just two Brighton boys
having fun in the sun...

1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:51.439
We've got DNA confirmation
on the Lorraine Welbeck foetus.

1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:53.599
Guess who the father is?

1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:54.960
Ronnie Welbeck.

1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:59.999
Not bad for a dead guy, eh?
The Immaculate Erection.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.559
See?

1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:03.799
This is why
we can't have nice things.

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:06.279
What about Katherine Jennings?
We couldn't find her.

1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:09.999
No. I mean, she's here.
She's downstairs.

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.879
My real name's Abby Morton.

1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:15.359
I flew back to England
to try to escape my boyfriend.

1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:18.639
I thought using a different name
would make it easier.

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.600
But I was wrong.

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:26.479
OK, Abby, would you like to tell us
what's going on?

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:29.439
Everything we need to know
about you, your mother,

1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:31.280
and the man
you say who kidnapped her.

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:35.959
I was left a collection of stamps.

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:39.839
I didn't know anything about them,
but I was dating this guy, Ricky,

1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:44.559
in San Sebastian, who was
in the rare stamp and coin business.

1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:46.719
Ricky? As in Richard Skebbs?

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:49.079
Yeah. Yeah, you know him?

1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:51.160
Yeah. We know him. Go on.

1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:55.319
Well, I asked him
to have a look at 'em for me.

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:58.519
See if they were worth anything.
I gave them to him.

1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:01.159
He gave 'em back
a couple of days later.

1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:03.839
He said there were a few there
that might be worth something,

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:07.999
but most of them were replicas.
Collectable, but not valuable.

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.519
He said they're worth
a couple of thousand euros at most.

1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:16.239
But a few days later, I was having
a look at one of his stamp mags

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:20.479
and I came across this article
about a Plate 77 Penny Red,

1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:24.239
went for over 450 large
at auction in London.

1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:27.799
It was similar
to the plate of Penny Reds I had.

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:32.719
Anyway, later that night
he was wasted,

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:34.959
so I had
a look at his laptop and I found

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:37.679
this bunch of emails to dealers
all over the world,

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:40.599
offering stamps that were
clearly mine for sale.

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:44.959
He'd broken 'em up so they couldn't
be identified as a collection.

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:47.279
And did you confront him?

1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:49.040
No.

1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:51.799
No.

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:56.159
When I first met him, he told me
how easy stamps were to conceal.

1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.279
How they were a great way
to launder money

1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:00.279
and transport it
all across the world.

1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:02.039
Even if you got stopped,

1:12:02.040 --> 1:12:05.119
most customs wouldn't have a clue
about their value.

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:08.640
'Ricky said the best way
to hide 'em was inside a book.

1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:12.959
'Hardback. Or anything like that.

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:15.880
'So, I searched his shelves.

1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.080
'And I found them.'

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:40.359
I packed a bag and flew out
on the first flight I could get.

1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:44.760
So why didn't you go to the Spanish
police, report what he'd done?

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:49.599
I thought he might spin the police
a story to get them back.

1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.000
Or come after me, try and hurt me.

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:58.119
My mum's not well.

1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:00.880
I need the money from the stamps
to pay for her to be in a home.

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:09.520
Did you ever meet this man?

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.119
No. Why? Who is he?

1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:18.399
His name's Ronnie Welbeck. He's
a known associate of Chad Skebbs.

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:22.199
We're looking for him in connection
with a double murder. Murder?

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.439
That's right,
the body of his first wife

1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:27.199
was found recently
in a storm drain in Brighton.

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:30.319
And his second wife, Lorraine,
was recovered from the boot of a car

1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:34.679
in a pond on land that we believe
Welbeck owns in Biarritz.

1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:36.600
She was four months pregnant.

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.559
Both his wives had just come into
considerable sums

1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:47.760
before they were killed.
You're sure you don't know him?

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.000
He may be calling himself
Dave Nelson now.

1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:58.200
Call himself what he likes, I...
I wouldn't know. I've never met him.

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:05.439
So you say you were left
these stamps.

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:08.599
Yeah. That's right.
By whom?

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:12.079
Mrs Jennings. Katherine Jennings.

1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:15.760
She was an old lady
I was a live-in carer for in Spain.

1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:19.679
And where are they now?
They're...

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:21.640
they're safe.

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.200
You believe her?
Not really.

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.599
But whatever else she's lying about,
I do believe she's frightened.

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.759
There's no way
she would come and see us

1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:35.639
unless she was genuinely scared
for her mother's life.

1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:39.599
But she's lying about where she came
by the stamps. Almost certainly.

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:41.439
Ronnie was already seeing Lorraine

1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:43.799
by the time
Joanna came into her inheritance.

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:46.399
So Ronnie rids himself of Joanna,
and then ends up with the money,

1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:48.639
and Lorraine into the bargain.

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:52.159
Further down the line, he fakes his
own death to escape his creditors

1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:54.239
and then cashes in
on his life insurance.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:57.159
Which Lorraine collects
and converts into stamps.

1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:01.399
And then, Lorraine fakes her death,
flies under an assumed name to Spain

1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:05.319
to join Ronnie and start a new
life as Margaret and David Nelson.

1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:07.799
And then history repeats itself.

1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:10.799
Ronnie meets Abby,
the next thing you know,

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:14.119
Lorraine's in the boot of a car
in a pond in France.

1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.839
And the stamps? Well, I think she's
twisting the story a little bit.

1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:21.679
So Ronnie gets in touch
with his old mate Skebbs

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:23.759
with a view to selling the stamps.

1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:26.199
And Skebbs rips him off by replacing
the real ones with fake.

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.399
And Ronnie sends in Abby
to get them back,

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:30.759
and, well, the rest goes down
pretty much the way she said.

1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:32.999
Yeah,
but we'll get to the bottom of it.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.519
But right now, our priority
is getting Abby's mum back alive.

1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:39.279
And on that score, all we can do

1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.600
is wait for Skebbs
to make his next move.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:51.839
Ma'am.

1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:55.879
Abby Morton, Katherine Jennings,
is currently sitting in a hotel,

1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:58.199
awaiting instructions from Skebbs

1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:01.199
for the handover
of the stamps and her mother.

1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:04.880
I'd like Cassian on the team.
In an observational capacity.

1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:09.200
The man has tried to suggest
I murdered my wife.

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:14.639
That's an observation. Cassian is
an experienced hostage negotiator.

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:18.239
I'd like Skebbs taken alive,
with no loss of life,

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:21.759
and no major injury to any of my
officers or members of the public.

1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:23.560

1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:54.679

I was trying to help.

1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:56.959

1:16:56.960 --> 1:16:59.719
In your search
of my house and garden.

1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:01.239
Nothing.

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.360
No. And do you know why?

1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:07.040
Because I didn't murder my wife.

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:56.199
So you think Skebbs got hold
of the stamps from Ronnie Welbeck,

1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:00.479
then Abby Morton, in her turn,
ripped off Skebbs for Ronnie?

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:02.359
Something like that.

1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:04.559
So where are the stamps now?
With Abby.

1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:07.559
We've had them scanned
and photocopied, for our records.

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:11.119
And she's agreed to produce them
as an exhibit, if necessary.

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:13.359
And Hegarty is certain
they're the ones

1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:15.519
that he bought for Lorraine Welbeck?

1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:18.599
Not so certain that he's willing
to testify in a court of law.

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:20.479
None of this brings us a step closer

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:22.960
to arresting Ronnie
for Joanna and Lorraine.

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:28.520
We've got two murder victims here,
Roy. Two dead women.

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:33.479
Don't want us to lose sight
of that fact. I haven't, Ma'am.

1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:35.560
Not for a second.

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:39.439
'What about putting
more surveillance on her?'

1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:41.839
I suspect that Ronnie Welbeck
will have long flown the coop

1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:43.239
from wherever he's been holed up.

1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:46.159
He'll have seen online that we've
found the remains of his wives.

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:49.280
He wouldn't risk coming back here.
Abby'll go and meet him somewhere?

1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:51.799
Put out an "all ports".

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:54.719
She buys a ticket,
or someone matching her description

1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:57.720
turns up at passport control,
hopefully she'll lead us to him.

1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:13.120
What are you trying to win?

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:17.599

at a luxury hotel in Mauritius."

1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:20.039

1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:22.079

1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:45.559
Well, Hegarty's certain that the
stuff we photocopied is all rubbish.

1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:48.319
And no-one's actually
reported the stamps stolen.

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:50.519
Well, couldn't the insurance
companies that paid out

1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.279
on Ronnie Welbeck's life
have a claim?

1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:54.559
Same problem. Chain of title.

1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:57.079
Without Hegarty testifying
that they are the same stamps,

1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:59.159
how are they going to prove it?

1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:00.760
So where do we think she is now?

1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:03.959
Lying on a beach somewhere.

1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:06.399
'Sipping margaritas,

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:08.560
'and grinning her head off,
I suspect.'

1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:19.320
Smart lady.

1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:23.400
Yeah, I certainly wouldn't want
to cross her.

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:26.239
On the upside,

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:29.399
I did hear a rumour
from Ground Control.

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:32.759
"Pepe le Pew" has applied
for a transfer.

1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:35.440
That's right. Back to the Met.

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.480
What brought that on?

1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:43.240
I think being here
was pushing him over the edge.

1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:50.240
THEY LAUGH

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:02.640
