00:01.035 --> 00:03.602
<i> In the criminal justice system</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:05.404
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:05.406 --> 00:08.173
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.142
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:13.479
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:13.481 --> 00:16.215
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:16.217 --> 00:19.184
Your mom's paying
for an A.P. prep course?

00:19.186 --> 00:20.586
You don't need it.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.021
I need a five.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.423
She thinks
it's the best way.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.059
The best way is not
to worry so much.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.061
Easy for you to say.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.398
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

00:32.400 --> 00:34.233
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

00:34.235 --> 00:37.102
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

00:37.104 --> 00:39.204
What did he say?

00:39.206 --> 00:42.341
<i> Low faan...</i> barbarians.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.610
They don't want Tim
hanging around white people.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.246
Your family
still doesn't want

00:47.248 --> 00:48.614
to meet me, do they?

00:48.616 --> 00:52.184
Why don't you take me home
with you right now

00:52.186 --> 00:54.053
and introduce me
to your mother?

00:57.358 --> 00:59.425
You handled that real well.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.064
Kate, what are you doing?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.198
Walking.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.068
I'd say you're
an insensitive jerk.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.603
I'd say it was none
of your business.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.206
Both you and Tim
are<i> real</i> mature.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.108
(<i> gunfire</i> )

01:16.110 --> 01:17.276
What was that?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.119
Oh, my God!

01:27.121 --> 01:29.088
Oh, my God!

01:29.090 --> 01:30.289
No!

01:33.494 --> 01:35.861
LOGAN:
<i> Let me get this straight.</i>

01:35.863 --> 01:37.229
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.099
You got three shots,
but no witnesses?

01:40.101 --> 01:42.367
Maybe people thought
it was a car backfiring.

01:42.369 --> 01:45.104
This is a freaking
echo chamber in here.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.106
It must have sounded
like the Fourth of July.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.108
It didn't happen
on the streets.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.343
You want a guy who saw
two dogs nearby?

01:51.345 --> 01:52.611
Hey, no problem.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.114
A dog did it.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.217
Okay, kid still had
his wallet on him.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.886
Get this: a thousand-dollar
laptop computer

02:00.888 --> 02:02.387
in his knapsack.

02:02.389 --> 02:07.126
He was a star physics student
at Manhattan Science.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.227
A dead end.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.895
No way out the back.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.397
Kid leaves his friends on
the way back from school.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.500
Why does he walk
in here?

02:14.502 --> 02:16.902
Someone was waiting,
called him in.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.470
Or he was expecting
somebody.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.905
Maybe.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.474
So have C.S.U. check
the grounds, every inch, okay?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.742
Right.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.512
Have you seen
the Jade Squad report?

02:26.514 --> 02:29.548
Three Chinese gang hits
in two months.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.621
We're going to take you
to the precinct.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.623
You can call
your parents.

02:37.625 --> 02:42.161
He'd still be alive if I'd
just kept walking with him.

02:43.731 --> 02:47.499
You never think something
like this would happen

02:47.501 --> 02:49.168
to people like us.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.405
Somebody ought to tell him

02:53.407 --> 02:56.175
bullets don't recognize
your I.Q.

02:57.745 --> 03:02.247
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

04:20.294 --> 04:21.360
They just drove by.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.362
Tim said something
in Chinese.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.830
Then they were gone.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.365
Here.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.967
These boys in the car,
these were Tim's friends?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.969
She told you,
she hardly saw them.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.804
Let your daughter talk.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.040
Tim didn't talk
about his friends.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.809
So you didn't recognize
any of them.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.378
They weren't
from school.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.979
BOY:
Those leather jackets--

04:40.981 --> 04:44.049
they looked like
they were in a gang.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.318
Tim wasn't in a gang.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.953
He did live in Chinatown.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.955
And what does that mean?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.657
Mom.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.625
You know something
about the boy's family?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.460
I do business with the Chinese.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.729
They live in a different world.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.932
They're from Canal Street,
not Mars.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.072
3:30 in the afternoon
and nobody sees this thing?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.373
There were
six uniforms.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.075
They didn't turn up
anybody

05:10.077 --> 05:12.044
so we canvassed
and we got nothing.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.646
It's the back
of an apartment house.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.481
Not a lot of people there.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.084
We can't be sure if it was
the Chinese kids in the car.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.353
What can we be sure of?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.355
If you grow up in Chinatown

05:23.357 --> 05:25.957
you're a gang member
or you have troubles.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.326
Any indications of gangs?

05:27.328 --> 05:29.061
C.S.U. found three shells.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.664
Ballistics says
they're .380 Tanfoglio titan.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.034
That's an expensive weapon
for an ordinary street kid.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.669
Okay, I'll buy that.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.771
Let's see what the family says.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.039
Great, I can't wait.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.941
"Sorry about your son.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.811
Was he running
any protection rackets?"

05:45.813 --> 05:49.047
Find a more diplomatic way
of putting it, Mike.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.355
Please don't mention that
in front of my mother.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.790
My brother wasn't in a gang.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.793
Miss Chong, we're trying
to find a motive.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.395
I would have known.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.797
All due respect ma'am, you're
older than your brother.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.099
You don't live down here...

06:07.101 --> 06:09.067
My mother would have known.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.471
She paid more attention
to Tim's life than her own.

06:14.408 --> 06:18.377
All Tim wanted
was to get out of here.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.879
He was going to M.I.T.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.883
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

06:27.421 --> 06:29.421
Policemen, Mother.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.090
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

06:32.092 --> 06:33.859
Tim not in gang.

06:33.861 --> 06:37.129
Sometimes when children
are away from home...

06:37.131 --> 06:39.431
He told her everything.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.767
Not about
his girlfriend.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.102
CERRETA:
Did Tim ever seem upset

06:44.104 --> 06:46.838
or look like he'd been
in a fight?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.774
All the time,
after every drug deal.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.047
He spent his weekends
at the library.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.450
Your brother must have had
some friends

06:58.452 --> 06:59.885
in the neighborhood.

06:59.887 --> 07:03.155
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

07:05.826 --> 07:09.127
Just school friends.

07:09.129 --> 07:13.098
Do you think we could see
your brother's room?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.967
Maybe get a picture
of him?

07:15.969 --> 07:18.837
If she didn't know
about the girlfriend

07:18.839 --> 07:21.840
maybe she didn't know
about his friends

07:21.842 --> 07:23.141
on the street.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.527
Chairman Mao, Albert Einstein,
and Patrick Ewing.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.030
What do you think
they got in common?

07:45.032 --> 07:47.566
One 17-year-old
Chinese kid.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.008
Phil, look at this.

07:57.010 --> 08:03.515
"Timothy Chong, winner of
the NASA Science Competition."

08:03.517 --> 08:06.051
This kid had everything.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.053
So why is he dead?

08:08.055 --> 08:10.055
I got a better question.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.524
Why did he go
to a plastic surgeon?

08:12.526 --> 08:15.527
"Removal of tattoo"?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.062
Gang insignia?

08:17.064 --> 08:19.931
Maybe the M.E.
Can tell us.

08:19.933 --> 08:23.668
First, I want to talk to someone
on that Jade Squad.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.936
MAN:
<i> Tiger tattoo.</i>

08:24.938 --> 08:27.072
That's the White Tigers.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.674
But this kid went
to Manhattan Science.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.077
That tiger on his arm
wasn't a fashion statement.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.846
He has no record.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.614
Half the smack in the country
blows through here.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.682
You seen a lot of arrests?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.551
Maybe they're
paying you off.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.285
Yeah, millions.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.153
My mortgage is a front.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.155
You got nobody
on the inside?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.057
I had one.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.293
You got a medium,
you can talk to him.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.029
We found him in little pieces
on Hester Street.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.666
Listen, how bad do you want
to break this?

08:54.668 --> 08:58.937
I know a kid in the Tigers
who will talk to you.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.941
If there's any hint they did it,
you'll know.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.645
Tim Chong--
I seen it in the papers.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.080
Rumor has it
he was a White Tiger.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.181
Yeah, for five seconds.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.083
Was it a happy divorce?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.318
We don't shoot people.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.954
My lawyer--
he advises against it.

09:15.956 --> 09:19.057
You always take
your lawyer's advice?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.593
Why would we want
the kid dead, huh?

09:21.595 --> 09:24.629
Tim Chong buys
that American dream crap.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.064
We didn't care.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.933
See that kid over there?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.067
Kid sells smack.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.670
What some stiff at IBM
makes in a year

09:31.672 --> 09:33.305
he can make in one week.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.106
No matter
how much you make

09:35.108 --> 09:37.175
it's hard to spend it
in Attica.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.311
We didn't do Tim Chong.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.979
All right, listen.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.013
A wagon

09:42.015 --> 09:44.082
like a Jeep or a blazer.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.016
Yellow.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.085
Who drives it?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.320
I don't know.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.055
If I knew, I'd tell you.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.657
We didn't want the kid hit.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.627
So much
for the American dream, huh?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.629
He did everything right.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.364
Wound up dead anyway.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.935
Ballistics compared the slugs
from Chong

10:03.937 --> 10:06.171
to every Chinese gang killing
in the past three years.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.039
No match.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.076
This kid is 17 years old-- how
many enemies could he have?

10:11.078 --> 10:14.045
This kid was getting bagged
for having white friends.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.247
The wind only blows
in one direction?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.650
There's going to be talk.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.986
We ought to run
at the girlfriend

10:20.988 --> 10:22.020
without the mother.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.254
CRAGEN:
That's risky.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.724
If she's involved

10:25.725 --> 10:28.193
whatever she says is useless
without a parent there.

10:28.195 --> 10:32.330
When her mother's around,
everything she says is useless.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.666
Most of Timmy's friends
were white.

10:34.668 --> 10:38.003
He's American, so that
wouldn't be a problem, right?

10:38.005 --> 10:41.106
Some of my friends,
they call me an egg.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.275
White on the outside,
yellow on the inside.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.177
Calling names
is one thing

10:46.179 --> 10:49.014
but does it go
beyond that?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.048
It's not violent.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.416
LOGAN:
No fistfights?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.218
Breaking into a locker?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.686
The worst it gets--

10:54.688 --> 10:56.821
somebody sprayed graffiti.

10:56.823 --> 11:00.825
It said "slant-eyes"
on the door of the 1600 Club.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.662
It's a study group
for the S.A.T.S.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.363
1600's a perfect score.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.832
The club's about half Chinese.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.002
So Tim wasn't having
any trouble with anybody?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.437
I'm really not sure.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.373
We weren't communicating
very well.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.208
Well, who would he talk to?

11:17.210 --> 11:20.679
Maybe Mr. Steinman,
our physics teacher.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.381
He knew tim pretty well.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.684
Tim's the best I ever taught.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.352
How long have you
been teaching?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.354
Long enough not to exaggerate.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.089
He won the NASA award.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.426
This year, he was a shoo-in
for the Hellmuth Competition.

11:34.428 --> 11:37.762
Kids give him grief
for screwing up the curve?

11:37.764 --> 11:39.764
Students are
sophisticated here.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.299
They compete to get in.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.034
What about after?

11:43.036 --> 11:47.038
Getting in is the start
of the race, not the end.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.773
This science competition--
the Hellmuth--

11:48.775 --> 11:51.342
do you have anybody else
who might win it?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.778
What are you getting at?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.880
Any prize money
for it?

11:55.882 --> 11:58.717
$20,000, but it isn't the point.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.453
It's the Nobel Prize
of high school.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.289
Who's the also-ran?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.291
Any number of people.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.727
Are you betting
on any favorites?

12:11.298 --> 12:12.764
Okay...

12:12.766 --> 12:15.400
he was with Tim
when he was shot.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.434
The Borland kid.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.802
Carl.

12:17.804 --> 12:20.772
He and Tim
were always number one and two.

12:20.774 --> 12:21.906
Since when always?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.441
Since freshman year.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.077
Drove Carl's mother crazy.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.779
I don't know how bad it was

12:27.781 --> 12:31.182
but parent-teachers night,
Carl's parents up in front

12:31.184 --> 12:32.450
Tim's mother in back.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.885
Boys were friends.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.321
The parents
never even said hello.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.391
I remember that night.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.827
Mrs. Borland
couldn't even look at us.

12:42.829 --> 12:43.928
Weren't Tim

12:43.930 --> 12:45.263
and Carl friends?

12:45.265 --> 12:46.765
Carl's a nice boy.

12:46.767 --> 12:50.268
His mother is not
a well woman.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.304
What does this have
to do with Tim?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.106
Two kids are friends.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.208
Usually the parents say hello.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.210
She said hello when she called

12:59.212 --> 13:01.346
and said we weren't
real Americans--

13:01.348 --> 13:03.515
why should Tim
get the prizes?

13:03.517 --> 13:07.352
Carl's older brother
called, too.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.188
You're not saying...

13:10.190 --> 13:14.926
(<i> speaking Chinese</i> )

13:14.928 --> 13:16.494
My mother wants to know

13:16.496 --> 13:18.930
are you suggesting Tim
was killed

13:18.932 --> 13:22.400
so Chinese kid
wouldn't win the scholarship?

13:28.241 --> 13:31.109
Every parent wants his kid
to be number one.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.478
Every parent doesn't make
threatening phone calls.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.213
You talked to Chong's
girlfriend twice.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.049
Trouble like this
she would have mentioned.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.151
She was a wreck.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.287
She probably would have told us.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.322
We're talking
about $20,000

13:44.324 --> 13:46.124
and the biggest
science prize

13:46.126 --> 13:48.210
in the whole country.

13:48.211 --> 13:50.295
And Marian Borland is wired
about her son Carl.

13:50.297 --> 13:54.532
Looked to me like the father
was playing with a full deck.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.569
Why don't we pay her a visit,
punch a few buttons

13:57.571 --> 14:00.038
and rule her out--
that okay with you?

14:00.040 --> 14:03.208
That's okay with me.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.043
We were all shocked.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.312
Tim's murder--
it's horrible.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.582
Maybe we should raise
our children in the suburbs.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.584
I guess it's
as bad there.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.286
So, what does this
have to do with me?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.990
Claudia Chong said you made
some unpleasant phone calls.

14:18.992 --> 14:23.061
I love my son.

14:23.063 --> 14:27.265
Maybe sometimes... I go too far.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.300
How far is that?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.236
Oh, this is ridiculous.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.238
Tim was a lovely kid

14:33.240 --> 14:35.974
but the boys
were very competitive.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.108
It wasn't healthy.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.077
Do you have children?

14:40.247 --> 14:42.213
You know how hard it is.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.315
Yes, but I don't call
other parents

14:44.317 --> 14:47.218
when their kids
get better grades than mine.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.220
I admit I was...

14:49.222 --> 14:51.322
inconsiderate.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.124
Did you tell the Chongs

14:53.126 --> 14:54.993
that Chinese
shouldn't win prizes?

14:54.995 --> 14:57.562
Of course I didn't.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.565
At 3:30 on the afternoon
that Tim Chong was shot

15:00.567 --> 15:02.133
can you tell us
your whereabouts?

15:02.135 --> 15:05.103
This is unbelievable.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.672
The idea that I...

15:07.674 --> 15:10.208
Mrs. Borland, look,
we got to ask you.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.010
(<i> sighing</i> )

15:12.012 --> 15:14.012
It was Thursday?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.414
My shift ends at 3:30.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.385
Randy, my oldest boy,
picks me up and takes me home.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.187
Maybe one of the employees
saw you leave.

15:23.189 --> 15:26.658
I don't know
who would have seen me.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.293
Where can we find Randy?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.661
Fulton Fish Market.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.129
He works with his father.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.331
Thank you.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.267
This hasn't been easy
on any of us.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.338
Right.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.708
Every Tuesday and Thursday
I get her.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.645
Anybody here when you left
to pick her up?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.213
Nobody comes till late.

15:49.215 --> 15:53.151
Hey, guys, my mom told me
what you're thinking.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.619
Really?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.121
We just left her
20 minutes ago.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.356
Yeah, but she called.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.992
Lunch hour,
she's under pressure...

16:00.994 --> 16:02.327
you coming in like that.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.395
So you picked her up
at 3:00, right?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.731
3:30. I dropped her at home.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.167
Look, maybe my mom said
some dumb things...

16:09.169 --> 16:11.469
You called
the Chongs, too, right?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.739
My mom wouldn't kill anybody.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.075
What happened after you
dropped her at home?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.277
"Y", 23rd street,
shot some hoops.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.012
Regular game 4:00.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.247
I get back,
there's a note from dad.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.183
He went to take care of Carl.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.718
Didn't that worry you?

16:26.720 --> 16:30.688
I was sorry
about the Chinese kid

16:30.690 --> 16:34.225
but somebody's
got to run the stall.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.294
I got to get some ice.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.334
LOGAN:
<i> You think she called randy</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:46.304
to make herself feel better?

16:46.306 --> 16:49.307
To make sure
he got the time right.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.742
Did you notice

16:50.744 --> 16:54.212
that he wasn't exactly
an aerospace engineer?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.215
I also noticed
he's not her favorite son.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.417
Well, if she lied, he lied.

16:59.419 --> 17:03.154
If he's lying,
where did they go

17:03.156 --> 17:05.023
after he picked her up?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.025
She didn't go home.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.293
He didn't shoot hoops.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.696
You're praying
at the right church.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.032
You going
to read that to us

17:14.034 --> 17:16.034
or fan us with it?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.235
"Borland, Ronald

17:17.237 --> 17:18.803
"296 South Street

17:18.805 --> 17:21.806
D.B.A.
R. Borland & son, Fresh Fish."

17:21.808 --> 17:24.809
Carry permit:
.380 Tanfoglio titan.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.312
Seems to me it's the gun
I said it would be.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.214
Let's get a warrant.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.316
What do you mean
he said no?

17:32.318 --> 17:34.519
You want me
to try Portuguese?

17:34.521 --> 17:37.355
He said you cannot have
a search warrant.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.091
Since when is Judge Feinstein
so picky?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.393
Since he got a clerk
who knows about guns.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.362
He said a Tanfoglio
is too common.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.131
Just because Borland has one
doesn't give probable cause.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.267
Big bunch of crap.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.536
You want some probable cause?

17:51.538 --> 17:54.138
Try breaking some alibis.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.608
Okay.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.077
You think marian borland
punches a time clock at work?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.244
Randy went to the "Y."

18:00.246 --> 18:02.180
Basketball buddies notice

18:02.182 --> 18:04.182
when you're
holding up a game.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.316
Good, that's very good.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.452
And next time you need a warrant

18:07.454 --> 18:09.454
don't go to Judge Feinstein.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.856
WOMAN:
Everything is computers now.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.225
So you don't
have the records?

18:14.227 --> 18:16.327
I'm looking,
I'm looking.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.329
Maybe I have
her time card.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.331
They come back
from the service.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.300
Sometimes I remember
to save them.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.303
Looks like you have cards
from World War II.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.339
All I hear is,
"They shortchanged me.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.875
I lost an hour.
They cheated me."

18:30.877 --> 18:32.343
No, not here.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.444
Sorry.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.446
I must have dumped them.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.349
Marvin, I can't find it.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.352
My payroll man
doesn't have it either.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.387
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.389
She clocked out at 2:30.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.291
He won't swear by it.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.294
He could have entered it
wrong off the card.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.196
2:30?
She said 3:30.

18:52.198 --> 18:55.233
If she entered it wrong,
she would have complained.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.801
Missing pay, right?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.836
She don't have
the check yet.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.171
Thanks, Marvin.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.272
Later.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.441
Don't tell her
we were here.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.609
You're cops.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.646
Now if you were I.R.S.,
I might tell her.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.582
Thursdays, 4:00.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.218
It's a great time for Randy.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.453
He works the graveyard shift.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.890
So last week
he was here at 4:00.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.358
Always on time.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.260
Got the court for an hour.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.896
You know randy
pretty well?

19:24.898 --> 19:26.330
High school.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.599
You talk to him today?

19:28.601 --> 19:31.402
No. Why?

19:31.404 --> 19:34.338
Well, I'm asking you
questions about him

19:34.340 --> 19:37.275
but you're not asking
what it's about.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.343
Locker room
sign-in sheet.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.345
Rand signed in at 3:51.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.482
Like I said,
we play at 4:00.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.452
The computer
at the payroll service--

19:48.454 --> 19:51.322
not a lot of probable cause.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.456
We got to try.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.659
This time we try
Judge Allan Berg.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.395
Spell it with two L's
and two A's

19:57.397 --> 20:00.464
or we're never
going to get a warrant.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.434
We want the business,
296 South Street

20:03.436 --> 20:09.307
and the apartment,
which is 573 East 30th Street.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.509
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

20:13.413 --> 20:15.413
Detective Logan.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.615
Yeah.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.351
Uh-huh.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.620
Uh, can you wait a minute?

20:22.622 --> 20:25.623
I'm going to put you on hold.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.291
Don't go away.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.929
Where is it?

20:31.931 --> 20:32.930
Where is it?!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.332
What?

20:34.334 --> 20:37.268
Got a tip
on the Chong shooting.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.272
Ah, come on.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.307
Okay, somebody give me
a tape recorder.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.375
Batteries,
something!

20:44.377 --> 20:46.310
Get him back on the line.

20:46.312 --> 20:49.247
One, two, three.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.348
Yeah.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.583
Here you go, Logan.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.354
No, I'm not going
to put you on hold.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.322
Yeah, I'm listening.

20:58.324 --> 21:02.360
Well, I'd love to know.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.661
Uh-huh.

21:03.663 --> 21:09.667
Well, how do I know
you're on the up-and-up?

21:09.669 --> 21:11.402
Mm-hmm.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.572
You know what the address is?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.376
Mm-hmm.

21:18.378 --> 21:22.013
What kind of gun
am I going to find there?

21:24.050 --> 21:27.451
Hello? Hello! Hello!

21:29.555 --> 21:33.457
.380, that's the same caliber.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.993
That voice ring a bell?

21:37.363 --> 21:38.996
Me neither.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.016
Any bets?

21:42.017 --> 21:45.035
Friend, maybe somebody
who works at that fish market.

21:45.038 --> 21:48.039
What do you want to do?

21:48.041 --> 21:50.041
Address, caliber of gun--

21:50.043 --> 21:52.576
sounds reliable
and credible to me.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.079
Probable cause?

21:55.081 --> 21:57.448
If Judge Berg thinks it is.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.090
I should call my dad.

22:06.092 --> 22:09.627
If you want to do that,
I think you should.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.102
You have a key for this?

22:18.104 --> 22:21.105
Son, I'm going to have
to break into it.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.440
Okay.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.376
There was nothing
in the kitchen.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.716
Carl, you sure
you haven't seen a gun

22:31.718 --> 22:33.584
lying around the house?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.853
My dad keeps it
in the office.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.656
I think I've got
prints on this.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.793
That's my mom's good china.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.362
That's okay.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.098
<i>Nothing in here.</i>

22:49.369 --> 22:51.102
Mike.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.441
Bingo.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.512
(<i> gunshot</i> )

23:04.083 --> 23:06.417
The Italians make nice guns.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.687
It would be nicer
if it's the right gun.

23:09.689 --> 23:13.157
It would be nicer
if it were a clean match.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.431
R-7 twist.

23:20.433 --> 23:23.100
I wouldn't say this is close.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.603
I'd say exact.

23:27.673 --> 23:30.674
Yes, mama.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.410
Very nice.

23:32.412 --> 23:35.146
No question--
this gun killed Tim Chong.

23:35.148 --> 23:37.882
One set of prints on the gun.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.183
A good match

23:39.185 --> 23:42.186
to Ron Borland
from when he got his permit.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.889
His gun, his prints--
that's a problem?

23:44.891 --> 23:48.192
Considering he walked in here
an hour after the killing

23:48.194 --> 23:49.660
and didn't even blink?

23:49.662 --> 23:52.897
Why are the mother
and son fixing alibis?

23:52.899 --> 23:54.532
I thought Randy's held?

23:54.534 --> 23:55.666
Not anymore.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.935
Sign-in sheet from the "Y."

23:57.937 --> 23:59.670
Infrared scan.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.938
His pal fixed it.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.940
Unless you believe
in elves.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.710
You think the whole
Borland family killed the kid?

24:06.712 --> 24:10.214
Nothing puts the mother
and Randy at the scene

24:10.216 --> 24:12.650
but we do have the gun.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.585
We arrest Ron Borland

24:14.587 --> 24:16.587
maybe something breaks.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.722
Pick him up.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.662
Mr. Borland...

24:24.664 --> 24:27.665
I think you've bothered
my family enough.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.668
Ronald Borland,
you're under arrest

24:30.670 --> 24:33.237
for the murder
of Timothy Chong.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.972
Dad?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.808
Go call your mother.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.878
...used against you
in a court of law.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.518
I got to my store at 2:00.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.019
I didn't leave till Carl called.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.121
But your gun managed
to kill Timothy Chong.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.023
You fellows have, what--

24:53.025 --> 24:56.026
three open gang shootings?

24:56.028 --> 24:58.662
Maybe your lab got a little help

24:58.664 --> 25:00.898
with that bullet.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.600
I wouldn't try that

25:02.602 --> 25:03.634
with a jury.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.936
Why not?
Juries always trust cops?

25:05.938 --> 25:08.105
So, nobody saw you
at your store?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.808
I was there for Carl's call.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.610
An hour after the killing.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.078
40 minutes

25:14.080 --> 25:15.646
the way
I heard it.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.781
Your wife and Randy join you
in the shooting?

25:17.783 --> 25:18.916
<i>Finito,</i> gentlemen.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.185
If you're booking him,
let's do it.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.990
STONE:
<i> Why? I mean...</i>

25:25.992 --> 25:27.191
it makes no sense.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.127
I was back barely two hours,
Willis called.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.346
He'll take man two.

25:32.347 --> 25:34.564
We haven't even started
interviewing witnesses.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.166
Borland's prints are on the gun

25:36.168 --> 25:38.168
but Cerreto and Logan
are right--

25:38.170 --> 25:39.870
everything else
points away from him.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.939
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

25:43.876 --> 25:45.109
Yeah?

25:45.111 --> 25:47.044
Uh-huh.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.046
Attributed?

25:49.048 --> 25:51.599
Thanks.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.151
Tomorrow's<i> Post</i> says
we're negotiating a plea.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.953
No attribution.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.754
Willis dragging us
to the altar.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.790
I don't like shotgun weddings.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.825
I want to know what happened.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.961
So put a vise around that family

26:03.963 --> 26:06.630
and I don't care
how hard you squeeze.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.899
(<i> bell ringing</i> )

26:21.814 --> 26:24.715
I'm glad I don't have your job.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.924
I don't have
to talk to you.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.126
Did you hear them
plan it, Carl?

26:36.128 --> 26:37.928
I didn't know about it.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.798
I mean... that's not
the way it happened.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.733
Did your mom
go with your dad

26:42.735 --> 26:44.935
or just provoke him
into doing it?

26:44.937 --> 26:46.870
My parents
are good people.

26:46.872 --> 26:49.039
They only want
what's best for me.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.941
Killing someone?

26:50.943 --> 26:53.811
Is that how
you get the best?

26:53.813 --> 26:57.081
How did your dad know
where Tim would be?

26:57.083 --> 26:59.650
I'm not going to talk
to you anymore.

26:59.652 --> 27:02.920
Do you know what accessory
to murder means, Carl?

27:02.922 --> 27:04.888
My father didn't
kill anyone.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.056
His fingerprints
were on the gun.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.891
You don't know anything.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.728
You don't know
what you're talking about.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.799
Even Carl knows
his father didn't do it.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.835
How do you explain
the prints?

27:17.837 --> 27:19.837
Ben, what are you
trying to pull?

27:19.839 --> 27:21.238
Why are you talking to Carl?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.773
Leave my son alone.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.907
He's a witness.

27:23.909 --> 27:24.675
He's a kid!

27:24.677 --> 27:25.843
Get a headline.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.177
Make us look bad.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.913
Get them to leave him alone!

27:29.915 --> 27:32.049
If you'd like to sit down...

27:32.051 --> 27:35.019
My son's life is at stake here.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.054
I thought it was your husband's.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.257
There's a lot at stake here.

27:41.694 --> 27:44.094
WILLIS:
Let's go, Marian.

27:44.096 --> 27:48.198
Next time you want to see Carl,
do me a favor-- call first.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.136
The family is certifiable.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.904
Unlike everybody else.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.305
Who made that phone call?

27:55.307 --> 27:59.176
Obviously, you don't think
it was an angry employee.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.211
What if Ron Borland made it?

28:01.213 --> 28:03.247
Borland gets back
with Carl.

28:03.249 --> 28:07.818
He sees his wife and Randy
and he knows they did it.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.320
They're the ones
faking the alibis.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.990
Why didn't Borland
throw the gun away?

28:12.992 --> 28:14.992
Cerreta and Logan
are onto them

28:14.994 --> 28:16.894
so he does something heroic.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.264
Randy belongs to him the way
Carl belongs to his mother.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.900
So he wipes their prints
off the gun

28:22.902 --> 28:25.135
puts his own on,
takes the fall.

28:25.137 --> 28:28.338
You want to arrest the mother
and the older son

28:28.340 --> 28:33.110
and right now you wouldn't get
a conviction for bad thoughts.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.845
I have motive and the gun.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.148
If it's not suppressed because
of a questionable warrant.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.751
I can tell the jury about it.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.152
You won't get a conviction.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.922
If we don't arraign,
I can't even try.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.827
Fine. Try.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.396
Mr. Robinette,
can we have a statement?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.364
You trying this
in the press?

28:54.366 --> 28:56.133
According to public opinion

28:56.135 --> 28:58.769
my clients are
the salt of the earth.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.003
So was the victim.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.405
Ginseng maybe,
not salt.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.208
You having a bad week,
Leonard?

29:04.210 --> 29:06.744
Docket #51423

29:06.745 --> 29:09.279
the<i> People v. Marian Borland</i>
<i> and Randall Borland.</i>

29:09.281 --> 29:11.949
The charge is
murder in the se...

29:11.951 --> 29:15.185
Didn't I already see
this case on my docket?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.020
Charges against
a previous defendant

29:17.022 --> 29:18.188
were dismissed, Your Honor.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.390
The people regret their error.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.159
We're talking about murder.

29:22.161 --> 29:25.162
You ought to publish an apology
in the<i> Times.</i>

29:25.164 --> 29:28.098
How do the defendants
plead?

29:28.100 --> 29:29.166
Not guilty.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.400
Not guilty.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.302
I'll hear a few
spirited words

29:32.304 --> 29:33.971
on the subject of bail.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.906
Leonard, it's nice to see you.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.107
Thank you, Judge.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.309
My clients are not
a flight risk.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.079
Any high bail
would be a hardship.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.046
Mr. Robinette?

29:43.048 --> 29:44.348
The people request

29:44.350 --> 29:46.917
$50,000 on each defendant.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.119
The severity of the crime...

29:49.121 --> 29:50.120
Go no further.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.322
When you're right, you're right.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.291
This is
murder two.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.360
$50,000 each defendant.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.279
Next.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.197
You don't even know
who fired the gun.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.199
STONE:
Why don't
you tell me.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.367
Manslaughter two.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.069
They do the minimum, two to six.

30:06.071 --> 30:09.106
Why not 30 days
with time off for good behavior?

30:09.108 --> 30:11.942
Man one, they do the max,
eight to 25.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.377
You're hitting an elephant
with a fly swatter.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.012
You don't have a murder weapon.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.347
Has there been a ruling?

30:17.349 --> 30:21.084
The search warrant
should never have been issued.

30:21.086 --> 30:23.887
No jury ever hears
about that gun.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.122
Cancel the bravado.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.024
My career's built on it.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.192
The warrant was proper.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.394
An anonymous phone call
was probable cause?

30:30.396 --> 30:32.429
I don't think so.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.165
You knew Ron Borland
never fired that gun.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.868
And you know if I
discuss that with you

30:37.870 --> 30:39.203
I could be disbarred.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.104
Manslaughter two.
Last chance.

30:41.106 --> 30:43.874
You lose on the warrant,
no deal.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.943
See you in chambers.

30:49.148 --> 30:52.249
Man two? They put
three bullets into that kid.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.418
Willis is offering you a gift.

30:54.420 --> 30:58.956
The judge suppresses that gun,
you don't get a conviction.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.391
A similar warrant stood
in<i> Ashton.</i>

31:01.393 --> 31:03.227
They killed it in<i> Johnson.</i>

31:03.229 --> 31:05.128
That was two years ago.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.463
<i> Ashton</i> was last year.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.433
I don't want
to be overturned on appeal.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.034
Are you worried about

31:11.036 --> 31:13.086
our closure rate?

31:13.087 --> 31:15.137
I'm worried about them
not serving a day.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.440
They kill
over a prize

31:16.442 --> 31:19.176
maybe they'll get angry
at the mayor.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.144
There's no way
Simon suppresses the gun.

31:21.146 --> 31:25.148
Simon thinks that the A.C.L.U.
is too conservative.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.316
When's the hearing?

31:26.318 --> 31:27.918
Tomorrow.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.488
You lose on the gun,
you lose the case.

31:37.129 --> 31:41.164
WILLIS:
That search warrant
has no basis in probable cause.

31:41.166 --> 31:45.302
Your Honor, the informant not
only knew the caliber of the gun

31:45.304 --> 31:47.170
he knew where to find it.

31:47.172 --> 31:49.172
This was
an anonymous phone call.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.308
Well, let's look
at the standard.

31:51.310 --> 31:55.112
<i> Anguilar-Spinelli</i> calls
for a specific two-pronged test:

31:55.114 --> 31:59.383
the informant's reliability
and the basis of his knowledge.

31:59.385 --> 32:03.086
Now, Ben, how reliable
was that tip? A .380?

32:03.088 --> 32:05.956
Lots of people probably
knew Borland had one.

32:05.958 --> 32:08.558
The address you could
get from the phone book.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.294
The Supreme Court is adopting

32:10.296 --> 32:13.196
a less rigorous standard
for search warrants.

32:13.198 --> 32:16.166
They forgot why we have
the fourth amendment.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.569
Here in New York, thank God,
we have a stricter standard.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.473
The Court of Appeals is moving
with the Supreme Court.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.443
That permit was
for the Borland business.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.146
The warrant was
for the Borland home.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.348
Any idiot can see

32:31.349 --> 32:33.549
that the cops were relying
on the phone call.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.585
I'm not even an idiot.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.586
I can see it.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.322
I respectfully suggest...

32:38.324 --> 32:41.091
you can respectfully suggest
till New Year.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.226
The warrant is ruled invalid.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.461
The gun is suppressed.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.997
None of it goes
into evidence.

32:46.999 --> 32:52.035
You want to go to trial, Ben,
you go without the gun.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.707
When Randy Borland called,
what did he say?

32:56.709 --> 33:01.078
He said the police thought
he had something to do

33:01.080 --> 33:02.679
with this kid's murder.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.515
They wanted to know
what time he came to play

33:05.517 --> 33:08.385
and I said I'd say
whatever he wanted me to.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.120
What else did he
ask you to do?

33:10.122 --> 33:12.389
He said could I fix
the sign-in sheet.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.458
How do you do that?

33:14.460 --> 33:16.393
I can get behind the desk.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.329
I work part-time
checking membership cards

33:19.331 --> 33:23.700
and I knew some people
that signed in pencil.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.503
This is people's exhibit #11.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.505
It's an enlargement

33:28.507 --> 33:30.640
of the sign-in sheet
for that day

33:30.642 --> 33:32.709
subjected to infrared light.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.746
Would you please describe it
for the court?

33:35.748 --> 33:40.417
Randy's name is signed
over Larry Gordon's.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.685
I...

33:41.687 --> 33:45.022
I erased Larry's.

33:45.024 --> 33:49.026
Down here, Larry's name
is written over Randy's.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.794
So you changed the names?

33:50.796 --> 33:53.430
Yes, I did.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.165
What effect
did that have?

33:55.167 --> 33:57.434
It makes it look like
Randy got there

33:57.436 --> 33:58.668
an hour before he did.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.537
STONE:
No further questions.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.373
Your Honor, permission
to show this to the jury?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.642
JUDGE:
You may do so.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.582
I was given three shell casings
and three bullets

34:12.584 --> 34:15.052
removed from
Timothy Chong's body.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.054
What type of gun was used?

34:17.056 --> 34:19.523
Based on the grooves
on the bullets

34:19.525 --> 34:21.558
and the ejector marks
on the casings

34:21.560 --> 34:22.793
I concluded it was

34:22.795 --> 34:25.595
a .380 Tanfoglio titan
semi-automatic.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.431
During your investigation

34:27.433 --> 34:30.200
did you determine
whether Mr. Borland

34:30.202 --> 34:32.135
was licensed to carry a firearm?

34:32.137 --> 34:32.736
I did.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.104
What did you find?

34:34.106 --> 34:36.757
Mr. Borland
is licensed

34:36.758 --> 34:39.409
to carry a .380 Tanfoglio titan
semi-automatic.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.677
No further questions.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.413
How many licenses
has the state issued

34:43.415 --> 34:45.582
for Tanfoglio titan .380?

34:45.584 --> 34:47.084
I couldn't say exactly.

34:47.086 --> 34:49.619
If I told you it was more
than a thousand

34:49.621 --> 34:51.488
would you find that a surprise?

34:51.490 --> 34:53.090
I'm sure it's more than that.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.158
If I told you
the actual number

34:55.160 --> 34:58.128
was 2,941,
would that surprise you?

34:58.130 --> 35:00.097
No, it wouldn't.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.198
I'm glad.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.799
In your expert opinion

35:02.801 --> 35:04.434
could another gun

35:04.436 --> 35:07.504
have left the kind of markings
that you found?

35:07.506 --> 35:08.505
Very unlikely.

35:08.507 --> 35:09.840
Oh, so you<i> are</i> saying

35:09.842 --> 35:12.576
it could have been
another kind of gun?

35:12.578 --> 35:15.779
Excuse me, I concluded
that the gun was a Tanfoglio

35:15.781 --> 35:18.215
before I knew
Mr. Borland owned one.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.817
That's very cavalier of you.

35:20.819 --> 35:21.818
Thank you.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.454
No further questions.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.123
JUDGE:
I instruct the jury

35:26.125 --> 35:27.891
they may draw no conclusion

35:27.893 --> 35:29.526
from the fact that a weapon

35:29.528 --> 35:31.795
has not been entered
into evidence

35:31.797 --> 35:34.264
in this trial.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.632
Cloudy, muddy, murky.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.801
That jury
has enough reasonable doubt

35:37.803 --> 35:39.136
to bottle it solid.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.204
You can hear Willis
in summation--

35:41.206 --> 35:43.807
"The defendants lied
because they were scared.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.443
Yes, they own a gun,
but did they use it?"

35:46.445 --> 35:49.179
Marian Borland--
what did she tell the cops?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.714
"The kids were competitive.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.848
It was unhealthy."

35:51.850 --> 35:54.217
The only unhealthy competition
was hers--

35:54.219 --> 35:55.552
for her son's glory.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.521
You prosecuting or preaching?

35:57.523 --> 35:59.756
She pulled the trigger--
not physically...

35:59.758 --> 36:01.224
Oh. Metaphysically.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.927
She harped about
the Chong kid every day.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.562
Why did Randy kill him?

36:05.564 --> 36:07.898
You kick a dog long enough,
it bites.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.500
You want to try that
in your summation?

36:10.502 --> 36:12.702
Won't get you a conviction.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.271
It might get us a deal.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.773
Ron Borland was willing
to go to jail

36:16.775 --> 36:18.175
to save his son.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.209
Is he going

36:19.211 --> 36:20.510
to watch Randy
go now?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.646
You want him
to pressure his wife?

36:22.648 --> 36:23.713
I make the offer

36:23.715 --> 36:26.316
Randy does less time
than his mother

36:26.318 --> 36:28.585
he'll make his wife
take the deal.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.954
Giving the shooter
a better deal--

36:30.956 --> 36:32.489
is that what
you want?

36:32.491 --> 36:34.724
Uh-huh. I just don't know
if it will work.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.326
(<i> phone rings</i> )

36:37.930 --> 36:40.664
We're trying to arrive
at what's fair.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.300
I hope your clients
understand that.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.602
The sentences--
we have a problem.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.870
No, that's settled.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.206
Manslaughter two
for Mrs. Borland.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.740
She does two to six.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.343
Eight-and-a-third to 25.
No playing around.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.512
You said he'd be reasonable.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.880
Marian...

36:56.882 --> 36:58.782
It is unlikely
Mrs. Borland

36:58.784 --> 37:00.584
will be convicted.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.252
Finish the trial
and find out.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.753
You said a few years.

37:03.755 --> 37:04.888
You said parole.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.889
Be quiet, Marian.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.841
Mrs. Borland

37:07.842 --> 37:09.792
if you are convicted,
you will do 25 to life.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.628
We're offering much less.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.231
You said he wouldn't do this...

37:14.233 --> 37:15.298
Stop it.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.537
How long will Randy
be in prison?

37:20.539 --> 37:23.373
He pleads to man two,
he does three to nine.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.242
This isn't right.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.576
Mom...

37:26.578 --> 37:28.545
it's not going to help.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.947
Why don't we just go outside...

37:30.949 --> 37:32.282
Stop!

37:32.284 --> 37:34.918
He's 23.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.255
He has a chance for a life.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.689
Sit down.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.358
The trial isn't over.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.926
I don't see why...

37:42.928 --> 37:45.295
Because he's your son.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.270
I don't believe
we'll be convicted.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.971
I won't do this.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.614
STONE:
<i> Do you remember, Miss Chong</i>

38:04.616 --> 38:07.651
how many of these phone calls
occurred?

38:07.653 --> 38:12.055
Over the last six months,
nine or ten.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.891
What did Mrs. Borland say?

38:14.893 --> 38:17.927
She said Carl and Tim
shouldn't be friends

38:17.929 --> 38:20.330
that Tim was using Carl--

38:20.332 --> 38:22.599
using his brain.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.368
She called my brother...

38:27.072 --> 38:28.972
a chink.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.377
She said, "You chinks
aren't real Americans."

38:38.650 --> 38:42.719
And, uh,
what did Randy Borland say?

38:42.721 --> 38:49.459
He said... if Tim kept trying
to steal Carl's ideas...

38:52.964 --> 38:55.031
that he'd regret it.

38:57.969 --> 38:58.968
Thank you.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.705
No further questions.

39:01.707 --> 39:04.341
Now, Miss Chong, you said

39:04.343 --> 39:07.077
that the Borlands' calls
frightened you.

39:07.079 --> 39:09.012
Did you call the police?

39:11.116 --> 39:12.115
No.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.883
So, uh...

39:13.885 --> 39:15.785
how frightening were they?

39:15.787 --> 39:19.756
In our culture,
you don't call the police.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.992
Your family's friends--
are most of them Chinese?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.361
Objection. Relevance?

39:24.363 --> 39:26.730
The witness mentioned
her culture.

39:26.732 --> 39:27.864
Overruled.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.466
The witness will answer.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.935
Our closest friends are Chinese.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.704
Did you brother belong
to a Chinese gang?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.323
Your Honor...

39:36.324 --> 39:37.941
I'm allowing this, Mr. Stone.

39:37.943 --> 39:38.942
He quit.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.377
He wasn't really...

39:40.379 --> 39:43.079
And what was the name
of the gang?

39:44.816 --> 39:46.716
The White Tigers.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.453
This is defense exhibit #3.

39:50.455 --> 39:54.124
It's an article in last month's
<i> Crosstown</i> magazine.

39:54.126 --> 39:57.527
Would you please read
the circled portion aloud?

40:00.031 --> 40:02.599
"The White Tigers--

40:02.600 --> 40:05.168
"the most powerful
of the heroin-dealing gangs

40:05.170 --> 40:08.037
"or tongs,
are fighting a vicious turf war.

40:08.039 --> 40:11.040
"Two members
have been shot this year.

40:11.042 --> 40:14.077
No one thinks the war is over."

40:14.079 --> 40:15.478
Thank you.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.014
No further questions.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.922
You wouldn't vote
to convict?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.157
I'm not on the jury.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.792
But if you were?

40:28.794 --> 40:30.026
(<i> phone buzzes</i> )

40:30.028 --> 40:32.061
Yes?

40:32.063 --> 40:35.031
Mrs. Silver and her daughter
are out there.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.866
Send them in.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.043
My daughter has something
to tell you.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.545
Please, sit down.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.052
Go on, honey.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.988
I didn't want
to say anything.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.024
Carl is my friend.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.193
I like
his mom and dad.

41:03.195 --> 41:04.994
She feels guilty.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.765
She didn't know where
to put her loyalties.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.468
Katie...

41:11.470 --> 41:15.004
After the gunshots,
we were running.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.875
I must have looked
for just a second...

41:18.877 --> 41:21.144
I saw them.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.046
You saw who?

41:25.083 --> 41:28.051
Mrs. Borland...

41:28.053 --> 41:29.552
and Randy.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.788
You saw them on the street?

41:31.790 --> 41:34.023
In the truck.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.893
That truck must have been going
pretty fast.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.161
You sure it was them?

41:38.163 --> 41:39.829
I recognized it.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.099
It was the truck
from the fish business.

41:50.108 --> 41:53.843
LOGAN:
<i> on the stand? to put this kid</i>

41:53.845 --> 41:56.913
Yeah, we don't exclude evidence
that convicts.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.248
Why did she wait
so long?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.950
She and the Borland kid
are friends.

42:00.952 --> 42:03.052
She was torn apart.

42:03.053 --> 42:05.153
She didn't hold anything back
at the precinct.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.257
Are you saying
an 18-year-old kid lied?

42:07.259 --> 42:09.259
I'm saying she reads
the newspapers.

42:09.261 --> 42:11.928
They were saying
you'd need an act of god

42:11.930 --> 42:13.062
to convict the Borlands.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.164
You didn't see her
in our office.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.533
She's not
a good actress.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.567
She loved the kid.

42:17.569 --> 42:18.568
They killed him.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.069
How good
does she have to be?

42:20.071 --> 42:23.239
Without anything more specific,
I have to go

42:23.241 --> 42:25.141
with my instincts.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.678
Where were you
at the time?

42:28.680 --> 42:31.114
Carl and me--
we went around the corner

42:31.116 --> 42:32.649
after we heard the shots.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.551
And what did you see?

42:34.553 --> 42:39.222
It was sort of a flash--
this white truck

42:39.224 --> 42:42.625
and it had two people in it.

42:42.627 --> 42:46.062
Randy was behind the wheel

42:46.064 --> 42:49.198
and Mrs. Borland
was sitting next to him.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.334
They were coming towards me

42:51.336 --> 42:54.671
and I looked down
and I saw the license plate.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.105
I had seen it before

42:56.107 --> 42:59.576
when Carl's brother
had picked him up after school.

42:59.578 --> 43:02.045
What was on the license plate?

43:02.047 --> 43:05.882
It's one of those
that you have made special.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.885

43:11.990 --> 43:14.123
Why did you wait until now

43:14.125 --> 43:15.224
to say anything?

43:15.226 --> 43:17.260
I tried to forget it.

43:17.262 --> 43:22.031
I didn't even want to believe
that it happened.

43:24.603 --> 43:28.705
I told my mom, and she said
i had to tell the truth.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.242

Hi.
Ben.

44:17.322 --> 44:18.788
What's up?

44:18.790 --> 44:21.190
Um, I'd like

The girl's testimony

44:23.194 --> 44:25.662

For everything
in quotes, yes.

44:27.666 --> 44:30.667
She says she came running
around the corner

44:30.669 --> 44:32.301
and saw
the license plate.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.338
Does she have eyes
in the back of her head?

44:35.340 --> 44:38.041
CERRETA:
She said the truck
was coming toward her.

44:38.043 --> 44:40.376
The only way she sees
the license plate

44:40.378 --> 44:43.346
is if she turns around,
goes back to the corner

44:43.348 --> 44:45.448
and watches
the back of the truck

44:45.450 --> 44:46.716
as it pulls away.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.718
She saw the front plate?

44:48.720 --> 44:50.687
That's been missing for months.

44:50.689 --> 44:52.789
There is no
front plate.

Borland ordered a new one.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.759
The state never sent it.

44:56.761 --> 44:58.161
God bless bureaucracy.
