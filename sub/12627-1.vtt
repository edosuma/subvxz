00:17.384 --> 00:19.685
Alex, get serious.

00:19.719 --> 00:24.256
Alan iverson and 20 points
could not help your team.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.992
You know, Julie, I think
we looked pretty good
at that last game.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.361
Yeah, too bad
the other team showed up.

00:29.396 --> 00:32.464
You're the only team
in history that should
be sued for malpractice.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.099
So we've had a bad streak.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.901
19 games, to be exact.

00:35.935 --> 00:37.569
Well, today
we'll turn it around.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.338
Against the warriors?

00:39.372 --> 00:42.341
Yeah. Right.
They're undefeated.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.611
Tyler will be scraping
you off the bottom
of his sneakers.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.952
So, hey, Julie, are we gonna
shoot hoops after school?

00:53.987 --> 00:55.387
Are you kidding?

00:55.422 --> 00:57.156
I'm gonna kick your butt.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.957
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

00:58.992 --> 01:00.492
So long.

01:02.462 --> 01:05.230
Boy: Yo, joker! T.J.!

01:05.265 --> 01:06.732
Second boy:
Stick, what's up, man?

01:06.766 --> 01:08.033
Alex: Hey!
What's up, guys?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.334
Third boy:
What's up, Ben?

01:09.369 --> 01:11.804
Hey, joker's got
the answer to our
basketball problems.

01:11.838 --> 01:12.871
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.540
My dad's doing
some research
on cloning.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.376
If we get him to clone you,
you could pass for yourself.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.311
You know what?
That's hilarious.

01:23.483 --> 01:27.052
Boy: 2 alexes?
That's not hilarious.
That's frightening.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.088
Of course, you might
need those 2 bodies

01:29.122 --> 01:32.724
when Mrs. klein catches you.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.493
Mr. schlotsky.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.376
Oh! Oh!
Just give it to me.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.544
Whoa!

01:52.579 --> 01:54.146
When we celebrate hanukkah,

01:54.180 --> 01:58.417
we are really celebrating
the story of Judah
and the maccabees,

01:58.451 --> 02:03.856
a story that began
over 2,000 years ago

02:03.890 --> 02:06.492
during one of the earth's
darkest hours.

02:06.526 --> 02:10.562
The cruel king antiochus
had conquered the world,

02:10.597 --> 02:13.232
and decreed that
all people in every land

02:13.266 --> 02:15.767
should pay tribute
to his pagan gods.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.438
He sent merciless armies
to enforce his decree

02:19.472 --> 02:22.207
and to slaughter
all who disobeyed.

02:22.242 --> 02:29.148
Antiochus succeeded
everywhere except in
one corner of the empire...

02:29.182 --> 02:33.552
In a land called Israel.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.862
Teacher: Though the people
stubbornly resisted,

02:43.897 --> 02:47.566
they were no match
for antiochus' army,

02:47.600 --> 02:51.236
and in the face of certain doom,

02:51.271 --> 02:57.676
the people of Israel desperately
needed a great leader.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.925
Crowd:
Victory, victory, big score now!

03:12.959 --> 03:16.094
V-i-c-t-o-r-y!
Victory!

03:27.540 --> 03:29.975
Crowd:
V-i-c-t-o-r-y!

03:30.009 --> 03:32.578
Victory, victory, me oh my!

03:32.612 --> 03:34.947
V-i-c-t-o-r-y!

03:36.883 --> 03:38.717
Give it up now, schlots.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.186
Maybe I'll show you some mercy.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.156
In your dreams, Tyler.

03:55.335 --> 03:58.203
That's it, Tyler!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

03:58.238 --> 03:59.304
Yes! That's it!

03:59.339 --> 04:02.241
All right, now,
straighten them out!

04:02.275 --> 04:04.409
[Players and crowd
cheering and shouting

04:05.878 --> 04:08.847
man:
Ok, let's keep it up!

04:08.881 --> 04:10.916
Coach simowitz.
Huh?

04:10.950 --> 04:13.619
A little... a little coaching,
or some help, maybe?

04:13.653 --> 04:16.053
Oh, of course.
Absolutely. Of course.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.190
I can do that.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.259
♪ We are the lions ♪

04:20.293 --> 04:23.328
♪ the mighty, mighty
lions ♪

04:23.363 --> 04:25.931
Yes, warriors! Whoo!

04:25.965 --> 04:27.666
♪ The mighty, mighty
lions ♪

04:27.700 --> 04:30.002
Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Yes!

04:30.036 --> 04:31.403
Score!

04:31.437 --> 04:32.671
Must be getting ugly.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.173
Coach Larry has already
launched into his victory dance.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.876
It started ugly.
It's approaching
hideous.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.112
Come on, schlots!

04:43.049 --> 04:44.916
Pass the ball!

04:44.951 --> 04:45.984
Player:
I'm open!

04:46.019 --> 04:47.452
Pass it!

04:55.695 --> 04:56.828
Hey, ref!

04:56.863 --> 04:59.431
Referee: Got a technical
foul, number 5 blue.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.133
Player: It's not worth it.
Watch your temper, t.J.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.135
Watch the game, ref!
He was charging.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.603
Or haven't you read
the rule book yet?

05:04.637 --> 05:06.038
That's it.
You're out of here.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.639
Gee, thanks for the favor.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.775
Player:
Don't sweat it, teej.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.710
Hey, schlots...

05:11.744 --> 05:13.245
How does it feel
to be on the worst team

05:13.279 --> 05:15.013
in the entire history
of basketball?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.748
Lay off him, Tyler.
It's just a game.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.884
Sounds more like a massacre.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.619
But if you think this is bad,

05:20.653 --> 05:23.255
wait till you see what
we're gonna do to you
in the tourney. Yeah!

05:25.158 --> 05:28.060
32, this way.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.898
Player: Come on!

05:32.932 --> 05:34.800
I'm getting a new hard
drive for hanukkah.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.068
200 gigs of memory.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.904
That's enough to
download the entire
library of congress.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.272
T.J.'S the one
who's got it made.

05:40.306 --> 05:41.606
Christmas and hanukkah?

05:41.641 --> 05:42.774
Half Jewish, half Christian

05:42.809 --> 05:44.009
equals total holiday score.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.911
What about you, stick?

05:45.945 --> 05:47.279
You guys, man.

05:47.313 --> 05:48.347
What?

05:48.381 --> 05:49.881
Hanukkah should be
about the maccabees

05:49.916 --> 05:51.883
and the miracle of light
that followed their
victory.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.019
I'll take presents
over some old fairy tale.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.488
The miracle of light,
my friend, is no fairy tale.

05:56.522 --> 06:00.258
Ok, one day's worth of oil
just magically burning for 8?

06:00.293 --> 06:02.561
I mean, come on, man,
these things just don't happen.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.629
But that's why
they call it a miracle.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.298
What about you, schlots?
What are you asking
for hanukkah?

06:06.332 --> 06:09.167
Besides the word "pass"
being removed from the
English language.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.168
Hey, I would pass

06:10.203 --> 06:11.303
if the definition of
"pass" on this team

06:11.337 --> 06:13.672
wasn't turnover.
We stink.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.140
The only way
we know how to score

06:15.174 --> 06:16.274
is on the p.S.A.T.S.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.676
1470.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.677
1520.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.078
1600.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.113
In my sleep.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.347
1540, ok?

06:22.382 --> 06:25.016
Now can we please
stop talking about
the p.S.A.T.S?

06:25.051 --> 06:27.452
Every year, we get humiliated

06:27.487 --> 06:28.687
in the Liberty tournament.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.456
Well, this year,
the tourney is in
our home gym.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.792
And I don't want to
stink. For once,
i want to win.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.374
Alex:
Losing is bad enough, dad,

06:49.409 --> 06:51.943
but the other guys
don't even care.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.346
Do you know
we've lost 20 straight?

06:54.380 --> 06:55.881
I'm not sure.
Can you hum a few bars?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.182
Ba-dum-pah!

06:57.216 --> 06:58.617
That joke is so old.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.552
Hello, doctor.
Not old.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.553
Well seasoned.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.054
What's old is losing.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.624
We hold an all-time league
record for games lost.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.026
I know it's tough,
but hey, it's not
the end of the world.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.261
Mom, the Liberty tournament

07:09.295 --> 07:10.595
is the most important
even of my life.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.696
It's huge.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.367
Really? As huge as,
for instance, law? Medicine?

07:15.401 --> 07:18.170
Education? Remember when
you wanted to be
a superhero?

07:18.204 --> 07:20.272
Or the time you tried
to make rocket fuel

07:20.306 --> 07:21.673
so you could blow yourself
to the moon?

07:21.707 --> 07:23.442
What?

07:24.811 --> 07:27.612
I think what your mom's saying
is that as we get older,

07:27.647 --> 07:28.747
our dreams can change.
Well...

07:28.781 --> 07:29.781
Basketball is my dream.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.750
That results
in what, dear? The nba?

07:31.784 --> 07:32.918
Maybe.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.553
How many players
are there in the nba?

07:34.587 --> 07:35.720
348.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.657
So with 125 million
adult males in this country,

07:38.691 --> 07:41.526
that means your odds
of making it are about

07:41.561 --> 07:43.562
one in 350,000.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.833
Ugh. Gotta run
to the hospital.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.968
Look, Alex...

07:50.002 --> 07:51.536
I'm not trying
to dump on your dreams.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.905
I'm just trying to help you
keep things in perspective.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.809
We'll talk about that
rocket fuel thing later.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.088
Hey... You all right?

08:10.122 --> 08:12.090
Yeah, sure.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.060
I mean, what does mom
know about basketball?

08:15.094 --> 08:16.795
Yeah. Nice.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.331
You know, the nba
takes players from
all over the world,

08:19.365 --> 08:21.500
so actually, your
chances are much worse.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.835
Thanks. Now I'm really
cheered up.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.471
Alex, she means well,
ok? But for your mother,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.306
being a doctor is the
most exciting thing

08:28.341 --> 08:29.941
a person could ever do
with her life.

08:29.976 --> 08:34.513
As exciting as hitting
a 3-pointer right
at the buzzer?

08:36.649 --> 08:39.251
Ok, how about
a little one-on-one?

08:39.284 --> 08:40.852
For the last piece of
my double fudge cake?

08:40.886 --> 08:43.388
Show me your moves, old man.

08:43.422 --> 08:44.689
Well seasoned.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.461
Whoa!
Oh!

08:55.034 --> 08:56.735
I'd like to see you do that.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.676
Rabbi Lewis...

09:04.710 --> 09:05.944
He bum fakes...

09:05.978 --> 09:07.178
Spins by Shaq...

09:07.213 --> 09:09.147
Running rabbi,
he double clutches,

09:09.181 --> 09:10.315
elevates
for the jump-up...

09:10.349 --> 09:11.983
He shoots...

09:12.018 --> 09:13.852
Scores!

09:13.886 --> 09:15.820
Wah! Ah!

09:15.855 --> 09:17.422
From downtown.

09:17.456 --> 09:18.957
Hi, Alex...

09:18.991 --> 09:20.325
Uh, come in, come in, come in.

09:20.359 --> 09:23.395
Uh, something on your mind?

09:23.429 --> 09:25.297
Besides the yarmulke?

09:25.331 --> 09:26.932
Heh.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.500
Well...

09:28.534 --> 09:32.871
You said in class that
when the people of Israel
were up against the ropes,

09:32.905 --> 09:34.940
Judah maccabee
led them to victory.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.475
Oh, so you were listening.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.878
Our team needs a Judah maccabee.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.247
Is that so?

09:42.281 --> 09:44.849
Mr. simowitz has never
played basketball.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.285
I don't think he's ever
worn a pair of shorts.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.787
Can you hire us a real coach?

09:48.821 --> 09:51.189
Uh, well, your mother
chairs our board
of directors.

09:51.223 --> 09:53.024
Have you discussed this
with her?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.460
She's not much of
a basketball fan.

09:55.494 --> 09:56.528
Heh heh heh.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.296
It's hopeless.
We're hopeless.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.999
With the blessed one,
nothing is ever
hopeless.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.701
So you'll get us a coach?

10:02.735 --> 10:04.002
No.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.503
But you said...
Judah.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.272
Judah will get us a coach?

10:07.306 --> 10:09.941
You said your team needs
a Judah maccabee.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.944
Right. So, when is
this supposed to happen?

10:13.012 --> 10:14.579
When or where is not
the question.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.283
The question is,
will you recognize this
Judah when you see him?

10:25.157 --> 10:26.658
What do you think
the rabbi meant?

10:26.692 --> 10:27.726
How should I know?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.027
He meant that if you
don't want to flunk,

10:29.061 --> 10:30.795
you should be studying
your biology.

10:30.830 --> 10:31.930
Come on, stick.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.932
Maybe the rabbi meant,

10:33.966 --> 10:37.035
when you're really up
against it, god gives
you what you need.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.638
You know, like
sending an angel
to watch over you.

10:39.672 --> 10:42.674
Right now, the lions
need a coach,

10:42.708 --> 10:44.909
not some lousy angel.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.991
Think he can jam?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.329
Whoa.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.165
Wait.
Where you going?

11:07.199 --> 11:08.767
Alex...

11:12.905 --> 11:15.473
Mind if I rebound for you?

11:22.581 --> 11:24.482
What's he doing?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.984
Being a schlots.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.788
You got serious game.
Where do you play?

11:29.822 --> 11:31.089
Don't.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.827
Ok, uh, where did you play?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.462
Must've been somewhere.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.465
My name's Alex schlotsky.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.834
My friends call me schlots.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.836
What's yours?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.471
None of your business.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.612
Give me the ball, kid.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.316
Tell me your name,
I'll give you the ball.

12:06.959 --> 12:07.992
All right. We'll have
a shoot-out.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.762
Anything but dunks, ok?

12:10.796 --> 12:12.564
If I miss first,
I'll leave you alone,

12:12.598 --> 12:14.866
but if you miss first,
you gotta tell me
your name.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.371
How about you don't
give me the ball,

12:20.406 --> 12:22.907
and I stuff you
through that hoop
sideways?

12:29.281 --> 12:31.783
Well, that worked.
Except for
the stuffing you

12:31.817 --> 12:33.651
through the hoop sideways part.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.820
Hey, come on!

12:35.855 --> 12:38.289
I'm only 14.
How hard can it be?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.893
Well, guess you'll
never know his name.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.800
Virginia. Jm 165.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.104
Stick: Jm 165?

12:53.139 --> 12:55.306
His license plate.
It's a specialty plate.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.975
University of Virginia boosters.

12:57.009 --> 13:01.513
So, we'll check men's
basketball rosters.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.385
There he is.

13:07.419 --> 13:08.920
Lamont carr.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.156
Point guard for
the Virginia cavaliers.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.458
So, how come you only
get bs in school?

13:13.492 --> 13:15.794
It's a matter
of passion, Mr. stick.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.663
Look at his stats, man.

13:18.697 --> 13:21.099
You thinking what I'm thinking?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.635
Uh-huh. That
lamont carr is...

13:23.669 --> 13:24.736
Is Judah maccabee.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.604
Yeah.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.540
Wait. No. Man. What are
you talking about?

13:28.574 --> 13:30.408
Lamont's nickname
was "the hammer."

13:30.442 --> 13:31.910
So was Judah maccabee's.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.578
It's for his killer dunks.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.114
Judah could dunk?
Lamont, idiot.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.149
And this about
the license plate.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.653
Jm 165.
Jm... Judah's initials.

13:41.687 --> 13:45.123
And 165... the year
the maccabees drove out
the invaders

13:45.157 --> 13:46.291
and reclaimed the temple.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.293
Well, you're forgetting
one little thing.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.428
Judah's been dead
almost 2,000 years.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.163
2,160.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.632
Well, Judah maccabee or not,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.134
I think we might have our angel.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.136
Hey, guys, hitting the books?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.204
Hi, mom.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.873
I made you some cookies.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.445
We're...
I can't...

14:07.479 --> 14:09.447
After supper.

14:09.481 --> 14:10.715
Got it. Men at work.

14:10.749 --> 14:12.917
I'll just leave them
here, in case you
change your mind.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.622
Last time I tried to eat
one of your mom's cookies,

14:17.656 --> 14:19.090
I chipped a tooth.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.259
I heard that, Goldstein.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.930
I got a violin lesson.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.099
And I gotta study
for an algebra quiz,
and so do you.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.734
Look, it'll only
take half an hour.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.135
Forget it.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.805
Look, if you guys don't
want to see the ghost
of Judah maccabee,

14:33.839 --> 14:34.973
suit yourselves.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.274
Ghost?

14:36.308 --> 14:37.642
What are you talking about?

14:37.676 --> 14:39.611
Come with me and stick
if you want to find out.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.180
All right. That's enough.
You boys get any louder,

14:42.214 --> 14:43.748
you'll raise the dead.

14:43.782 --> 14:45.450
Alex and stick
already have,
Mrs. klein.

14:45.484 --> 14:48.820
They just saw
the ghost of
Judah maccabee.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.288
I'm surprised Mr. schlotsky
would recognize anybody

14:50.322 --> 14:52.023
who wasn't a basketball player.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.092
Actually, he w... ohh!

14:54.126 --> 14:57.295
It was just a figment
of our overactive
imagination.

14:57.329 --> 15:00.565
Brought on by too much
sugar and video games.

15:00.599 --> 15:01.966
Right, stick?

15:02.001 --> 15:03.434
Of course.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.271
Let's, uh, let's go.
No more sugar for you,
big guy.

15:13.479 --> 15:17.282
There is
no way that is
Judah maccabee.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.250
I mean, it doesn't
even look like him.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.486
You know what Judah
maccabee looks like?

15:21.520 --> 15:24.789
Well, I'm pretty
sure he wasn't 6'5",
African-American.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.492
Joker: Oh, I know.
Why don't we ask him?

15:27.526 --> 15:29.127
Excuse me, tall guy,

15:29.161 --> 15:31.996
you wouldn't happen to be
a Jewish military hero

15:32.031 --> 15:33.531
who, uh, started hanukkah

15:33.565 --> 15:36.901
and has been dead
over 2,000 years?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.904
Look, all that matters
is that when we needed
a coach,

15:39.939 --> 15:43.141
this really amazing
player shows up
at our very park.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.609
What are the odds?

15:44.643 --> 15:46.210
I'm gonna go talk to him, ok?

15:46.245 --> 15:49.147
You guys start playing
and try to look...

15:49.181 --> 15:50.782
Not terrible.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.287
Hey, it's me again.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.392
Yo, splot.
Schlots.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.428
That's my team
practicing over there.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.697
T.J., joker, stick,
and big Ben.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.900
My sympathies.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.737
You know, we haven't
won a game in 2 years.

16:12.771 --> 16:15.073
Really? Only 2 years?

16:15.107 --> 16:17.442
Well, we got this big
tournament coming up.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.743
Less than a month.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.578
You think you can help us win?

16:21.880 --> 16:24.482
Hey, man, we're not that bad.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.554
Ok, we're that bad, but
that's why we need you.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.590
I mean, don't you
believe in helping
the less fortunate?

16:32.624 --> 16:34.425
Best help I can
give your team...

16:34.460 --> 16:36.728
Find them a different hobby.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.930
Look, you don't
have to come to any
of our games,

16:38.964 --> 16:41.099
just, you know, coach us here.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.134
Look, kid, even if
i wanted to, I just...

16:43.168 --> 16:44.435
Don't have the time.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.471
I say you do.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.572
Pardon me?

16:47.606 --> 16:48.806
I checked you out on the web.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.841
You what?

16:49.875 --> 16:50.942
Your name's lamont carr.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.377
You played for the
university of Virginia.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.878
After playing for the cavaliers,

16:53.912 --> 16:55.947
you went to
the continental
basketball association,

16:55.981 --> 16:57.415
where you played for 5 years.

16:57.449 --> 17:00.084
Till you wrecked
your knee and had
to have 3 surgeries.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.086
Knee's better, ok?

17:02.121 --> 17:04.088
And I'm here waiting for
a tryout with the sixers.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.057
Not baby-sit
a bunch of kids.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.858
Look, we need a coach,
not a baby-sitter.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.895
You're just waiting.
You got time
to help us out.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.763
You know, you're wasting
your time on basketball.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.232
You should be a lawyer.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.767
So, you'll do it?
No.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.901
I'm a player.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.903
Coach is for has-beens
and wannabes.

17:18.936 --> 17:21.372
We can pay you.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.076
How much?

17:29.948 --> 17:32.417
Only 20?
And 20 more after.

17:42.461 --> 17:45.630
You bought yourself
an hour, not a second more.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.265
Tomorrow at 4:00.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.080
Where's dad?

18:02.114 --> 18:04.682
He had to leave early.
He's showing
the bender condo.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.385
Again.
So...

18:07.419 --> 18:08.753
You're cooking?
Yeah.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.321
I wanted to do
something special
for you.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.123
I know how much
you like waffles.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.594
Is this because I did
something bad?

18:16.628 --> 18:18.896
Kidding. You want
something from me?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.265
Can't I just treat you
'cause you're my son,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.201
and I love you?

18:23.235 --> 18:24.902
All right.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.737
There's this program
at the hospital.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.407
Students shadow doctors
around for a week,

18:29.441 --> 18:31.075
see how they like
the profession.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.611
If you're interested,
i can speak to one
of my colleagues.

18:33.645 --> 18:34.879
Ohh.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.549
There.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.088
Ok, here's the deal:

18:44.123 --> 18:45.923
You promise to think it over,

18:45.958 --> 18:47.758
I'll let you cook
your own breakfast.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.427
Deal.
Yummy.

18:53.665 --> 18:54.932
He's not coming.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.968
Since he's a ghost,
maybe he's already here,

18:57.002 --> 19:00.404
and we just can't see him.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.208
Hey, lamont, you made it.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.711
Yeah, Judah.
Judah?

19:06.745 --> 19:10.081
It's what we Jewish people
call our great athletes.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.750
You know, in case
we ever have one.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.420
Why you guys smiling?

19:16.455 --> 19:19.590
Never seen guys smile
before they ran 17-55s.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.925
What are 17-55s?

19:20.959 --> 19:24.262
It's a set of 17 wind sprints
from sideline to sideline.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.398
Unless everyone finishes
in 55 seconds,

19:27.432 --> 19:30.434
you run another set.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.038
For this, we're paying?

19:40.479 --> 19:42.713
Faster. Faster.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.786
A minute and 30?

19:49.955 --> 19:52.456
Come on, guys, run it again.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.727
What kind of practice
is this? Practice to
have a heart attack?

19:59.364 --> 20:00.865
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.474
All: Ball!

20:12.511 --> 20:15.313
That was terrible.
17-55s!

20:29.695 --> 20:30.628
All right.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.096
That's all for today, guys.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.966
What did we ever do
to make you hate us?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.100
I'm not here to like you.

20:36.134 --> 20:38.436
I'm here to make
a bad team
into a better one.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.505
The quickest way i
know how to do that
is through conditioning.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.974
Schlots.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.956
Next time, you pay me
before practice.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.761
See you tomorrow.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.093
This is ridiculous.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.630
I'll show you guys once
and for all this guy
isn't Judah maccabee.

21:39.665 --> 21:42.266
Judah had 4 brothers
and a dad named
Matthias, right?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.634
My bad boys ready to rumble?

21:43.669 --> 21:45.870
Yeah, in a sec.
First, though, we have
a couple of questions,

21:45.904 --> 21:48.306
like, what's your dad's name?

21:48.340 --> 21:49.807
Mr. carr to you.
What's this about?

21:49.841 --> 21:51.108
Well, if you're gonna
be our coach,

21:51.143 --> 21:53.311
don't we have the right
to know something
about you?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.014
Ok. They called
him skip.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.149
Ha ha!

21:58.183 --> 21:59.317
But his real name was Matthew.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.584
Close enough.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.420
How many brothers do you have?

22:02.454 --> 22:05.022
3. There was
a fourth.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.859
Policeman, D.C., but he
was killed 10 years ago.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.097
Ok, then.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.940
You know, I'm sorry
about your brother, man.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.013
Here's an extra 10

22:29.047 --> 22:31.349
if I never have
to hear 17-55 again.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.653
Thanks for reminding me.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.456
Yo! 17-55!

22:38.490 --> 22:40.157
Come on. Do it.
No, no.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.792
From end to end.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.532
Hey, schlots,
who's chasing you?
We're over here.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.201
Good one, Tyler.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.903
See you in the tourney.
First round, anyway.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.375
Schlots, did i tell you to stop?

22:57.409 --> 22:58.676
Let's get out of here.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.977
Come on.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.757
We can't afford
to keep paying him.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.759
My parents are starting
to ask me questions.

23:14.793 --> 23:17.128
Mine think I'm spending
it on junk food.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.229
If only it were true.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.830
Yeah, and what good
is it doing us?

23:19.865 --> 23:22.633
Come on. At least
Ben can make it up
and down the court.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.135
Great.
Now he's lousy
at both ends.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.237
Why can't we just ask
our parents for the money?

23:26.271 --> 23:29.573
No way. My mom can't
find out about this.
Got it?

23:29.608 --> 23:31.942
Then you come up
with the cash.
Got it?

23:41.019 --> 23:43.554
Dr. j, sorry, man.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.623
Sometimes you gotta
take one for the team.

23:47.025 --> 23:49.794
Mrs. schlotsky: Hey, Alex,
come down here, please.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.766
Hey, great news.

23:55.801 --> 23:58.636
You got a slot
in the hospital
shadow program.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.404
What?
Yeah.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.072
Starting Monday, after school,

24:02.107 --> 24:04.074
you'll be following
Dr. grimwald around.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.178
Mom, I can't. I've got
basketball practice.

24:07.212 --> 24:09.046
Well, this is a rare
opportunity, Alex.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.714
They may not do it next year.

24:10.749 --> 24:13.784
Look, I'm sorry,
but I've gotta practice
for the tourney.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.287
And I've gotta get you
ready for life.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.591
Thanks, mom.
You're the greatest.

24:26.164 --> 24:28.265
Your parents will freak.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.401
They gave you this card
for your bar mitzvah.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.770
What is the point
of selling it to pay
for lamont

24:32.804 --> 24:34.338
when you're not even
gonna be there?

24:34.372 --> 24:36.774
This way the other
guys can still practice.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.943
Believe me, they need it
if we're gonna win
that tournament.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.444
I can't do it all on my own.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.446
Really? And when
did that change?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.648
Julie, all you ever talk
about is basketball,

24:44.683 --> 24:46.083
you come to all my games,

24:46.117 --> 24:48.352
but you still don't
understand what
the games mean to me.

24:48.386 --> 24:49.920
You know what i understand?

24:49.955 --> 24:53.691
Getting to go on rounds
with a famous doctor,
that I understand.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.628
That's a great idea.
You take my place.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.129
What would your mom say?

24:59.164 --> 25:01.866
Just let me handle that, ok?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.901
Come on. With all
the suffering there is
in the world,

25:03.935 --> 25:06.237
it'd be wrong if you
didn't take my place.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.940
Lamont was right.
You should've been a lawyer.

25:15.780 --> 25:19.416
You got no compression.
Your rings, your valves
are shot.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.919
Gotta figure 300 to get
it back on the road.

25:21.953 --> 25:24.088
500 if you want it done right.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.257
When you decide, give me a call.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.632
Hey, coach.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.268
I got your money.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.136
Sorry, schlots, deal's off.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.638
What's wrong?

25:40.672 --> 25:42.273
I just can't help you anymore.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.976
My Van went bust on me.
I gotta come up
with some serious cash.

25:46.011 --> 25:47.778
We'll pay you double.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.448
No. No, no, I can't
do that to you guys.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.217
Come on.
You need the money,

25:53.251 --> 25:55.119
and with less than
2 weeks till the tourney,

25:55.153 --> 25:57.721
we definitely need the practice.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.957
Here. I can give you
the rest later.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.429
I appreciate this.

26:09.434 --> 26:12.436
There's, uh, there's
just one more thing.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.408
Why am I not surprised?

26:17.442 --> 26:21.111
Um, well, you know,
you love basketball.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.581
I love basketball.

26:23.615 --> 26:26.283
But the other guys are
starting to hate it.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.218
And if you could
ease up a little...

26:28.253 --> 26:30.087
I mean, not much.
We definitely still
want, you know,

26:30.121 --> 26:31.422
we want to win the tourney,

26:31.456 --> 26:35.092
but try and help them
love the game, too.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.496
Hey, lamont.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.633
My dogs.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.568
Ok, now that is it.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.137
First you try to
kill us, now you're
calling us names.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.439
Chill. Chill.

26:48.473 --> 26:51.141
Dogs is an expression like...

26:51.176 --> 26:52.776
My brother, my man.

26:52.811 --> 26:56.080
It's basketball talk for cool.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.514
Oh.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.850
So, should we
start running
till we puke?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.725
No. Today we shoot.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.427
Shoot?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.062
Shoot.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.202
He's not a ghost.
He's a god.

27:18.236 --> 27:19.803
Oh, yeah.

27:20.772 --> 27:22.940
Bingo.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.942
Man, I hate this game!

27:24.976 --> 27:26.677
You're thinking too much.

27:26.711 --> 27:29.546
You gotta get your head
out of the way of your body.

27:29.581 --> 27:33.550
Try it again. This time,
don't think, just relax.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.519
Shoot now.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.591
I love this game!

27:40.625 --> 27:44.228
All right, dogs,
that's all for today.

27:44.262 --> 27:47.431
Alex: So, uh,
how are we doing?
Be honest.

27:47.465 --> 27:51.468
Well, I would have to
say you guys have, um,

27:51.503 --> 27:53.637
potential.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.239
Us?

27:55.273 --> 27:58.475
A bunch of Jewish kids
like us have basketball
potential?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.077
Don't do that.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.379
Don't put yourselves
in a box, ever.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.214
Look, if we're gonna
do this thing,

28:04.249 --> 28:05.816
you've gotta start
believing in yourselves.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.052
You said "we."
What?

28:08.086 --> 28:10.421
You said,
"if we're gonna
do this thing."

28:17.962 --> 28:19.396
Alex: There's no other way, t.J.
If we don't get lamont

28:19.431 --> 28:21.398
the money to fix his Van,
we lose him.

28:21.433 --> 28:25.369
And if we lose lamont,
we lose the tournament.

28:25.403 --> 28:27.304
Yeah. We are gonna win.

28:27.338 --> 28:30.274
Just get as many
coffee mugs as you can.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.843
Mrs. schlotsky:
Alex? I'm home.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.645
Oh, um, call the others

28:34.679 --> 28:36.814
and, uh, remember,
don't sleep in.

28:38.683 --> 28:40.517
Hi.
Hey.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.019
So...

28:42.053 --> 28:43.187
How'd it go?

28:43.221 --> 28:45.089
Um, how did what go?

28:45.123 --> 28:46.590
The hospital.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.792
Oh. That. Um.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.962
It went by so fast,
it was like I was
hardly even there.

28:51.996 --> 28:55.566
See? I knew you'd
like it if you
gave it a try.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.035
So, did you, like,
feel good Karma?

28:58.069 --> 29:01.071
Mojo, mom. Nobody
under 50 says Karma.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.040
Ah. Mojo.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.143
Good night, mom.

29:06.177 --> 29:07.945
Book's upside-down, dear.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.754
Hey, stick, how much
money we got so far?

29:16.788 --> 29:18.322
Still short.

29:18.356 --> 29:20.991
If some people
would do less eating
and more selling,

29:21.025 --> 29:22.226
we'd be into some profit.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.727
What?

29:23.762 --> 29:26.630
Joker: Who's next?
Best coffee in all Philly.

29:26.664 --> 29:28.732
This is guaranteed to put
the hip in your hop,

29:28.767 --> 29:32.436
the slip in your slide,
the boo in your boo-tay.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.375
Except yours, Mrs. klein.

29:39.711 --> 29:40.811
I mean...

29:40.845 --> 29:42.146
Not that your hop isn't hip,

29:42.180 --> 29:44.715
or that there's
no boo in your...

29:46.050 --> 29:47.184
Alex.

29:47.218 --> 29:48.986
Mr. schlotsky.

29:54.526 --> 29:57.694
Mr. schlotsky,
what is going on here?

29:57.729 --> 29:59.163
Where?

30:02.066 --> 30:05.068
Oh. Well...

30:05.103 --> 30:06.703
That's a fundraiser.

30:06.738 --> 30:10.974
For some unfortunate
kids searching for...

30:11.009 --> 30:14.178
Better coordination
and a greater sense
of self-esteem.

30:14.212 --> 30:15.913
Right, guys?

30:22.921 --> 30:24.555
Have a great day.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.958
Smile, guys.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.729
Joker: If she buys that,
I'll eat my yarmulke.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.335
You're in a good mood.

30:38.369 --> 30:41.371
Alex is finally
getting excited
about becoming a doctor.

30:41.406 --> 30:44.007
I feel like I've
done something good.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.710
Maybe some of your good
Karma will help me sell
the bender condo.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.212
Mojo.
Say what?

30:48.246 --> 30:51.548
Karma is so out, dear.
Mojo is in.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.950
I'm impressed.

30:52.984 --> 30:55.953
You have to stay on top
of these things if you
want to be hip.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.754
You know,
i can't seem to find
the Espresso machine.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.623
Then I guess you'll have nojo.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.159
Very good.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.660
Hello?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.462
Oh, Mrs. klein.

31:05.496 --> 31:08.165
Yeah, Alex is on rounds
with Dr. grimwald
this morning.

31:10.835 --> 31:12.102
Interesting.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.372
Aw, come on, move it or lose it.

31:15.406 --> 31:17.875
I'm thinking lose it.

31:17.909 --> 31:20.177
Dr. schlotsky
would like to have
a word with you.

31:21.713 --> 31:25.182
Am I in trouble?
I certainly hope so.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.984
Alex: I was just doing
what you told me to.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.518
Rabbi Lewis:
Odd. I don't recall
suggesting

31:28.553 --> 31:30.687
that you con Julie,
lie to your parents,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.222
and hustle strangers for money.

31:32.257 --> 31:33.724
Well, maybe not exactly.

31:33.758 --> 31:34.892
Huh?

31:34.926 --> 31:36.493
Ok, maybe not at all.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.362
I believe
we were talking
about Judah maccabee.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.863
Yeah. And if we
wanted to win,

31:39.898 --> 31:41.732
we would need a great
leader like Judah.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.034
And then lamont carr
shows up at our very park.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.869
It was like it was meant to be.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.372
Now mom says we can't
be coached by some
stranger anymore.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.007
Well, I think your
mother has a point.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.341
Yeah, but doesn't
the torah say that

31:51.376 --> 31:54.344
we should invite
the stranger in and
love him as ourselves,

31:54.379 --> 31:56.880
because we were
once strangers
in the land of Egypt?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.449
You're absolutely right.
That's thinking.

31:59.484 --> 32:00.517
Yes.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.686
And that's why I'm going
to invite Mr. carr

32:02.720 --> 32:05.822
to join you and your
family at my house
for <i> shabbas</i>

32:28.379 --> 32:30.047
rabbi Lewis: Go ahead.
No, eat, eat.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.648
Sarah makes the best
gefilte fish.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.951
Here. Try it
with the horseradish.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.254
Horseradish? On fish?

32:37.288 --> 32:38.855
Yeah.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.528
Uh, salt and pepper, please.

32:48.099 --> 32:49.866
Outstanding, Mrs. Lewis.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.202
Sarah, please.
We're not that
formal.

32:52.236 --> 32:53.904
Try my chopped
liver, Mr. carr.

32:53.938 --> 32:56.039
Lamont. And I think I will.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.578
Here you go.

33:06.918 --> 33:10.153
Now, if I could only
bother you for a glass
of milk, I would...

33:13.057 --> 33:14.524
Appreciate it.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.227
Um, we don't eat
dairy after meat.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.495
Right.

33:18.529 --> 33:22.065
It's the whole kosher
thing. Never did
understand that.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.800
It's one of our
laws called <i> chukkim.</i>

33:23.835 --> 33:26.303
For which,
in modern times,
there's no explanation.

33:26.337 --> 33:30.173
At least, not one
that could be understood
by human logic.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.142
I guess it's like
my mama used to say,

33:32.176 --> 33:34.644
if you understood
everything god did,
you'd be god.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.979
I like that.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.348
So, what was your major
at Virginia?

33:38.383 --> 33:39.816
Exercise physiology.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.718
Alex says you're
a natural coach.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.421
I mean, the team is on fire.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.690
Yeah. Way better since
lamont started coaching us.

33:46.724 --> 33:48.358
Of course, they started so bad,

33:48.393 --> 33:51.828
they only had one direction
to go, which is up.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.298
Whether or not Mr. carr
is qualified to coach
is not the issue.

33:58.569 --> 34:01.038
Parents are concerned
that a total stranger

34:01.072 --> 34:04.007
is tutoring
their children
at a public playground.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.810
I can show him around.
I'll introduce him
to all the parents.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.746
The point is, Alex,
school activities

34:10.782 --> 34:12.581
should not take place
out on the street.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.150
Your mother's right, Alex.

34:14.185 --> 34:15.851
She's absolutely right.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.120
And that's why i propose

34:17.155 --> 34:20.257
that you do your
coaching at the gym
in the yeshiva.

34:22.927 --> 34:24.161
Um...

34:24.195 --> 34:25.829
You do know I'm not Jewish?

34:25.862 --> 34:29.966
I had suspected that, yes.

34:30.001 --> 34:33.437
But I do remember
the commercial for
feldman's family grocer.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.273
♪ So come on over ♪

34:36.306 --> 34:39.643
♪ even if
you're not kosher ♪

34:39.677 --> 34:42.512
♪ so come o... ♪

34:42.547 --> 34:44.181
Loved feldman's.

34:44.215 --> 34:45.549
Hated the commercial.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.350
Still, it made
a good point, huh?

34:47.385 --> 34:49.018
Perhaps you also don't
have to be Jewish

34:49.053 --> 34:51.088
to teach at a Hebrew school.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.023
This is such a great
opportunity.

34:53.056 --> 34:55.358
Did you know the nba
was started by
mostly Jewish teams?

34:55.393 --> 34:57.194
Yes. Basketball
association of America.

34:57.228 --> 34:58.595
We had the original Knicks...

34:58.629 --> 35:00.964
The Philadelphia
Hebrew all-stars.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.133
They were good.
That was a team.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.634
The ball
practically never
touched the ground.

35:04.669 --> 35:05.802
It was pass, pass, pass...

35:05.837 --> 35:07.637
Marshall.
It was like a ballet,

35:07.672 --> 35:09.106
with the pass, pass...
Marshall.

35:09.140 --> 35:12.142
I don't think that
we want to pressure
Mr. carr.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.743
Oh, it's no pressure.
I'm not pressuring.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.011
Good.
I'm not pressuring.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.913
Don't to it, then.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.316
I'm sorry to interrupt,

35:19.350 --> 35:21.651
but I'm gonna have
to turn down your offer.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.687
I'm not in Philly looking
for a coaching job.

35:23.721 --> 35:26.022
I'm hoping to get
picked up by the sixers.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.661
Aha. No, no,
there's a solution.

35:31.696 --> 35:36.266
We keep this temporary,
on a day-to-day basis.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.869
Certainly,
no one can have any
objections to that.

35:42.673 --> 35:44.774
Mrs. schlotsky:
I can't believe
you agree with the rabbi.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.377
So lamont moves practice
from the park to school.
What's the harm?

35:47.411 --> 35:50.347
The harm is Alex won't
concentrate on school.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.815
His studies'll go
out the window.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.583
He'll have great
ball-bouncing skills

35:53.618 --> 35:55.519
and no chance
at a good university.

35:55.553 --> 35:58.421
By the time he figures
out what he really wants
to do with his life,

35:58.456 --> 35:59.890
it'll be too late.

35:59.924 --> 36:01.992
When did you know you
wanted to be a doctor?

36:02.026 --> 36:03.160
When I was 10.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.629
And your dream came true.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.964
Why don't you want
the same thing for Alex?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.599
It's not the same thing,
Marshall.

36:09.634 --> 36:12.836
Alex is never gonna be
a professional basketball
player, and you know it.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.739
No. I don't know it.

36:15.773 --> 36:18.475
I suspect it,
but I don't know it.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.646
I think we should
give the rabbi's plan
a chance.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.026
Hey.

36:36.060 --> 36:38.094
Who's that?

36:40.765 --> 36:43.366
I feel like a gefilte
fish out of water.

36:43.401 --> 36:47.003
Relax, man. Everybody's
gonna love you here.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.610
Students who bounce
a basketball in the hall

36:53.644 --> 36:55.312
get it confiscated,
Mr. carr.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.380
I expect no less of you.

36:57.415 --> 36:58.682
Yes, ma'am.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.658
Everybody's gonna love me, huh?

37:08.693 --> 37:10.994
Oh, ho ho. Bless you.

37:11.028 --> 37:12.829
Bless you.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.965
You da mensch.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.668
The what?
Who was that?

37:18.703 --> 37:20.637
That was Mr. simowitz.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.974
Thanks to you, he doesn't
have to coach us anymore.

37:24.008 --> 37:26.343
Well, he looks
a little too happy.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.413
There you go, t.J.
Swing it back.
Bring it back out.

37:30.448 --> 37:31.982
Bring it back out.
There you go.

37:32.016 --> 37:33.516
There you go.
Set the pick.
Go left.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.786
Dish off, schlots,
you're the rock.

37:36.821 --> 37:37.921
Yeah.

37:39.724 --> 37:42.158
Schlots, you have
4 other people
on your team.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.727
Why are you the only
one shooting?

37:43.761 --> 37:47.063
Pass the ball.
Or do you know
how to pass?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.666
Sorry, coach.
Sorry?

37:49.700 --> 37:52.836
Let's run it again.
Come on. Let's go.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.404
Alex: All right, here we go.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.973
Come on, I want you
to swing the ball.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.909
Inbound the ball.
There you go.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.445
There you go.
Run down, stick.
Now, go, go, go, go.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.381
Set up the offense.
Set up the offense.
There you go.

38:04.415 --> 38:05.682
Pass. Pass it.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.350
There you go.
There you go, t.J.

38:07.418 --> 38:10.220
There you go.
Pass it in,
pass it in.

38:10.254 --> 38:11.788
Give it to schlots.
There you go.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.423
Hold it up.
Remarkable.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.893
There you go.
Remarkable
improvement.

38:16.927 --> 38:19.329
Might not recognize
which sport they're
playing.

38:19.363 --> 38:21.231
Long way to go yet.

38:21.265 --> 38:24.334
Ben, call for the ball.
Get more active.

38:24.368 --> 38:26.636
All right, all right.

38:26.671 --> 38:29.139
They still don't believe.

38:29.173 --> 38:32.409
You gotta believe
if you're gonna win.

38:32.443 --> 38:36.112
Drive left.
I'm sorry?

38:36.147 --> 38:38.815
The ancient maccabees
were hopelessly
outnumbered.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.284
A massive enemy army
against them,

38:41.319 --> 38:46.089
so they had to devise
a strategy to exploit
the enemy's weakness.

38:46.123 --> 38:49.259
So they retreated right
into the hills of judea,

38:49.293 --> 38:51.494
they carved tunnels
into the rock,

38:51.529 --> 38:54.998
but they made all
the turns to the right.

38:55.032 --> 38:57.300
So, when the enemy
came in after them...

38:57.335 --> 39:01.071
The enemy had to attack
with their left hand,
his weakness.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.940
Leaving the homeboys
to defend with their
right hand.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.778
You'd make a good
rabbinical student.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.947
And you'd make a good
assistant coach.

39:12.950 --> 39:15.952
Hold the ball,
hold the ball.
Listen up, guys.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.922
We're going to talk
about a winning team
called the maccabees,

39:18.956 --> 39:21.624
who turned their defense
into offense.

39:21.659 --> 39:24.194
And we're going
to do the same thing.

39:24.228 --> 39:26.696
It's called
a full-court press.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.665
All right, my dogs.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.967
That was a great shot.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.635
You got to ask yourself, Alex,

39:32.670 --> 39:35.338
if you were a ghost,
where would you go
at night?

39:36.674 --> 39:39.576
It's my mom.
Anyone need a ride?

39:39.610 --> 39:42.178
Yeah. T.J.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.813
T.J.?

39:46.517 --> 39:47.684
Thanks, bro.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.718
Alex, come on, man!

39:48.753 --> 39:50.186
What's Alex doing?

39:50.221 --> 39:52.188
What is he doing?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.523
Being schlots.

40:20.351 --> 40:21.751
Hey, watch it!

41:27.751 --> 41:29.719
Well, congratulations.

41:29.753 --> 41:32.956
Now you know i live in my Van.

41:34.892 --> 41:37.994
Uh, you don't have
any family or anything?

41:38.028 --> 41:41.097
You know, schlots,
sometimes people need
their space.

41:41.131 --> 41:46.102
Uh, people, maybe.
What about ghosts?

41:46.136 --> 41:47.337
Ghosts?

41:47.371 --> 41:50.306
Well, yeah.
Some of the guys
on the team...

41:50.341 --> 41:53.543
Not me... think
that you're the ghost
of Judah maccabee.

41:53.577 --> 41:55.912
Why is that?

41:55.946 --> 41:58.815
Um, same nickname,

41:58.849 --> 42:00.917
same number of brothers,
stuff like that.

42:00.951 --> 42:05.288
Well, I've never heard
of a ghost with
bad knees. Have you?

42:05.322 --> 42:07.524
I never thought you were.

42:07.558 --> 42:10.360
Uh... I'm going
to leave now.

42:10.394 --> 42:12.495
Schlots...

42:15.566 --> 42:17.667
Since you're already
down in the hood,

42:17.701 --> 42:21.337
how about staying for dinner?

42:24.208 --> 42:25.508
So, what was your average?

42:25.543 --> 42:29.178
27 points, 10 rebounds,
10 assists.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.513
That's amazing!

42:30.548 --> 42:31.915
That was only in c.B.A.

42:31.949 --> 42:34.317
Those are solid stats anywhere.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.819
I mean, I would give
anything to do
what you're doing.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.488
What? Live
in a grungy Van?

42:38.522 --> 42:40.723
No, man. You know,
following
your dreams.

42:40.758 --> 42:41.791
Doing what you love.

42:41.825 --> 42:45.028
You want to know what I love?

42:48.732 --> 42:51.534
That's Charmaine,
my high school sweetheart.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.536
The little guy there,
that's Trey.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.238
Already got a great hook shot.

42:55.272 --> 42:57.106
Where are they?

42:57.141 --> 42:58.441
Back in Virginia.

42:58.475 --> 43:01.010
I bet you miss them.
Every day.

43:01.045 --> 43:04.414
Chase big dreams,
you got to make
big sacrifices.

43:06.283 --> 43:11.688
Hey, Alex, maybe
you shouldn't tell anybody
about where I live.

43:11.722 --> 43:14.357
I know you're
cool with it, but...

43:14.391 --> 43:16.859
Just not sure
about Mrs. klein,
you know?

43:16.894 --> 43:19.295
Yeah. As long as you
don't tell the guys

43:19.330 --> 43:21.431
about me
coming to check
if you were a ghost.

43:21.465 --> 43:24.500
Hey, I'm not doing
so good as lamont carr.

43:24.535 --> 43:27.837
Maybe being this Judah guy
will give us all some luck.

43:29.573 --> 43:31.007
27 points...

43:36.380 --> 43:38.348
Mr. carr, I see
you've neglected

43:38.382 --> 43:40.550
to fill out your
place of residence.

43:40.584 --> 43:43.519
Yes, um...
I-i recently moved,

43:43.554 --> 43:46.055
and the address
slipped my memory.

43:46.090 --> 43:48.224
You know how that can be.

43:48.258 --> 43:50.026
I guess not.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.363
Our insurance policy
requires that
the school provide

43:53.397 --> 43:56.065
our employees'
place of residence.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.501
Of course. Um...

43:58.535 --> 44:00.003
7...

44:00.037 --> 44:01.671
7...

44:01.705 --> 44:02.772
6...

44:02.806 --> 44:04.340
6...

44:04.375 --> 44:05.341
2...

44:05.376 --> 44:06.342
2.

44:06.377 --> 44:07.977
7...

44:09.647 --> 44:11.114
7.

44:15.653 --> 44:16.986
Jefferson.

44:17.021 --> 44:18.588
Jefferson.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.724
Thank you,
Mr. carr.

44:21.759 --> 44:23.326
You're welcome.

44:26.063 --> 44:27.830
Thanks, tom.

44:58.762 --> 45:00.830
Happy hanukkah.
Give me a kiss.

45:00.864 --> 45:03.466
Happy hanukkah.

45:05.069 --> 45:08.137
Uh, an encyclopedia cd.

45:08.172 --> 45:09.872
This is just
what I wanted. Thanks.

45:09.907 --> 45:12.408
You're welcome,
even though
you are faking it.

45:12.443 --> 45:13.976
Try this.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.653
Wow! Dr. j.

45:23.687 --> 45:24.787
How did you know i sold it?

45:24.822 --> 45:26.122
Julie snitched.

45:27.691 --> 45:30.860
Happy hanukkah, honey.

45:49.012 --> 45:52.181
Mrs. klein: Why would
coach carr lie
about his address?

45:52.216 --> 45:54.383
I drove up and down
Jefferson today,

45:54.451 --> 45:57.019
and 7627 does not exist.

45:57.054 --> 45:58.354
Yes. That is odd.
No, no, no.

45:58.388 --> 46:00.490
Odd is wearing socks
that don't match.

46:00.524 --> 46:02.492
Odd is pistachio ice cream.

46:02.526 --> 46:04.460
I like pistachio.

46:04.495 --> 46:07.764
Falsifying an application
is a serious offense, rabbi.

46:07.798 --> 46:10.299
Yes, yes. Well,
perhaps he has
a good reason.

46:10.334 --> 46:12.301
Please don't straighten my desk.

46:12.336 --> 46:13.970
I cannot take any chances.

46:14.004 --> 46:16.439
Not when the safety
of my students is at risk.

46:16.473 --> 46:20.143
Yes, yes. Well,
perhaps we should
keep an eye on him.

46:20.177 --> 46:23.012
That's exactly
what I intend to do.

46:23.046 --> 46:25.648
Oh, dear.

46:28.986 --> 46:30.987
Brian, b-. Huh, huh.

46:31.021 --> 46:33.156
Jacob, a-. Hmmm.
You could do better.

46:33.190 --> 46:36.159
Ha-shem answers
prayer, Alex,

46:36.193 --> 46:38.661
but sometimes, the answer is...

46:38.695 --> 46:41.697
Next time, try studying.

46:41.732 --> 46:44.133
C-. Come, come, come.

46:44.168 --> 46:47.837
We have another
serious problem
to discuss.

46:49.673 --> 46:53.676
Principal klein
plans to follow
coach carr home

46:53.710 --> 46:55.845
after basketball practice
tonight.

46:55.879 --> 47:00.183
And should she discover...
I'm just making this up...

47:00.217 --> 47:03.853
That he lives in a Van...

47:03.887 --> 47:07.323
I'm not sure I could
overrule her objections
to him working here.

47:07.357 --> 47:11.994
If he lived in
a regular apartment,
that would be ok, right?

47:12.029 --> 47:13.429
Would that be possible?

47:14.832 --> 47:16.465
Cover my back with coach.

47:19.870 --> 47:21.704
Da, da, da, da, da...

47:21.738 --> 47:23.639
C-.

47:27.277 --> 47:29.212
Dad...

47:29.246 --> 47:30.479
Alex...

47:30.514 --> 47:31.981
What're you doing home?

47:32.015 --> 47:34.150
You're still having trouble
selling the bender condo, right?

47:34.184 --> 47:36.018
The last serious offer I got,

47:36.053 --> 47:37.820
I was riding my pet dinosaur.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.656
Well, i-i think I have
someone who wants it.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.491
Um, but he doesn't know it yet.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.126
And I'm pretty sure
he can't afford it.

47:44.161 --> 47:47.864
Great, great.
That's exactly the kind
of client I dream about.

49:16.553 --> 49:19.555
Alex, what's going on?

49:19.589 --> 49:21.424
What's this?
The key to this door.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.693
Count to 5,
then unlock it
and come in.

49:23.727 --> 49:24.927
Hey, uh...
But, I...

49:31.868 --> 49:33.669
One... 2...

49:33.704 --> 49:35.338
Quiet!

49:38.208 --> 49:40.509
3... 4...

49:44.414 --> 49:47.049
5.

49:53.390 --> 49:54.523
Oh!

49:57.394 --> 49:58.961
Can't afford it.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.831
Well, you can stay
here for free until
my dad sells it.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.268
I don't take
hand-outs.

50:06.303 --> 50:07.670
Dad says they sell better

50:07.704 --> 50:08.871
if there's someone
living in them.

50:08.905 --> 50:10.339
I can't even afford
the utilities.

50:10.374 --> 50:12.308
I'll pay
the first month.
Excuse me?

50:12.342 --> 50:14.010
I'll sell
my Dr. j. Card.

50:14.044 --> 50:15.378
Again.
I told you...

50:15.412 --> 50:17.446
I don't take charity.
End of discussion.

50:17.481 --> 50:19.482
It's not charity.
It's a trade.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.050
You get an apartment.
I get a coach.

50:21.084 --> 50:22.184
Hard to argue with that.

50:22.219 --> 50:23.853
It's hard to argue
with schlots, period.

50:25.922 --> 50:28.024
Ok, ok. Um...

50:28.058 --> 50:30.926
What do you say
Alex keeps his card,

50:30.961 --> 50:34.830
and instead,
i finish the place up
and do some painting?

50:37.067 --> 50:40.202
Mr. carr,
we've got a partnership.

50:40.237 --> 50:41.337
All right.

50:46.109 --> 50:47.076
Yes!

50:47.110 --> 50:49.278
Liberty tournament,
here we come.

51:00.223 --> 51:01.857
Alex...

51:01.892 --> 51:04.860
Marshall...

51:04.895 --> 51:07.329
I got pizza!

51:15.739 --> 51:18.140
C-.

51:20.544 --> 51:23.345
It's becoming clear
that Alex can't handle
both school and basketball.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.515
Do you remember
what rabbi kaplan
used to say?

51:26.550 --> 51:28.684
Sometimes a blessed
one waits on us,

51:28.718 --> 51:30.519
and sometimes we would do well

51:30.554 --> 51:32.521
to wait on the blessed one.

51:32.556 --> 51:34.023
He also said the blessed one

51:34.057 --> 51:35.724
looks with favor
on those who act.

51:35.759 --> 51:39.462
Dr. schlotsky and i
are prepared to involve
the board of directors

51:39.496 --> 51:42.431
if we believe
academic standards
are being sacrificed.

51:42.466 --> 51:44.200
There's no need for that.

51:44.234 --> 51:45.501
If things don't
turn around soon,

51:45.535 --> 51:47.103
I promise
I'll intervene
personally.

51:47.137 --> 51:51.373
With your Patience, rabbi,
our people might still
be wandering the desert.

51:54.411 --> 51:56.212
Ha-shem works
in mysterious ways.

51:56.246 --> 51:57.913
Not nearly so much as a rabbi

51:57.948 --> 52:00.783
scheming to win
some silly
basketball tournament.

52:00.817 --> 52:04.553
Sometimes, a little
silliness is good
for the soul.

52:04.588 --> 52:06.655
Here. Watch.

52:06.690 --> 52:08.858
Bowl... the bowl.
Ready?

52:08.892 --> 52:10.826
Woo, woo, woo.

52:11.862 --> 52:13.295
Ohh!
Ahh.

52:13.330 --> 52:16.265
Ah. I insist
that you try.
You try.

52:16.299 --> 52:18.367
I insist.

52:18.401 --> 52:19.768
The bowl, the bowl.

52:19.803 --> 52:21.837
All right.

52:29.913 --> 52:31.180
Ahh!

52:31.214 --> 52:33.349
Mrs. klein!
Mrs. klein!

52:33.383 --> 52:34.850
Yes!

52:34.885 --> 52:37.686
Oh. I have work
to do.

52:38.922 --> 52:40.022
Mmm.

52:40.056 --> 52:42.725
Let's hold it down,
dogs, let's hold it down.

52:42.759 --> 52:46.795
Now, whatever happened
before, is behind us.
Understand?

52:49.332 --> 52:53.068
Ben, what do dogs do?

52:53.103 --> 52:54.336
Barf on the carpet.

52:55.338 --> 52:56.705
Dogs bark, coach.

52:56.740 --> 52:59.241
Thank you, t.J.
Dogs bark.

52:59.276 --> 53:02.878
So, I'm asking my dogs
is this a new team?

53:02.913 --> 53:03.879
Ruff.
Woof.

53:03.914 --> 53:05.447
Woof.
Ruff.

53:05.482 --> 53:06.982
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.551
That's pathetic.

53:08.585 --> 53:11.420
Is this a team?
I want a bunch
of bulldogs.

53:14.591 --> 53:17.426
All right. That's better.
Ok. Now...

53:17.460 --> 53:21.497
Every dog on this team
does what's best
for the team, right?

53:25.769 --> 53:29.572
And the team does
what's right for every dog.
Let me hear it.

53:31.107 --> 53:35.177
So, the team
is going to ask schlots
to sit this one out, right?

53:38.381 --> 53:40.382
Because he's failing history.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.151
So, until he gets his grades up,

53:42.185 --> 53:45.454
the best thing the team
can do for him
is do without him.

53:49.259 --> 53:51.060
All right, guys, let's go.

53:51.094 --> 53:52.061
Come on.

53:52.095 --> 53:54.563
Come on, dogs,
let's go! Go!

53:54.598 --> 53:56.232
Let's get it on.
All right. Here we go.

53:56.266 --> 53:57.866
Let's go!

54:10.580 --> 54:13.482
Boy: Defense, defense!
Come on, dogs, let's go!

54:15.619 --> 54:17.553
Yes! Yo, defense!

54:20.090 --> 54:22.091
I'm the only who's ever
cared about this team.

54:22.125 --> 54:24.660
I found lamont, and now
they're playing without me.

54:24.694 --> 54:26.495
Gee, they're playing
great even though

54:26.529 --> 54:28.197
you're not there
to hog the ball.

54:28.231 --> 54:29.565
Imagine that.

54:29.599 --> 54:32.401
Why do you even bother
to show up for my games?

54:32.435 --> 54:34.603
You saying you don't
want me to come?

54:34.638 --> 54:36.171
Not if you're just
going to hassle me.

54:36.206 --> 54:37.606
Press! Press!

54:41.778 --> 54:44.380
Julie, come on!
You know I didn't...

54:44.414 --> 54:45.748
Mean it.

54:59.029 --> 55:00.729
Hey, Alex, you home?

55:00.764 --> 55:01.864
Schlots!

55:01.898 --> 55:03.666
Hey, Alex, we heard rabbi Lewis

55:03.700 --> 55:05.234
say you could
take a do-over
on the test.

55:05.268 --> 55:06.368
Why are you guys here?

55:06.403 --> 55:08.537
Because we're a team.
If one of us is in trouble,

55:08.571 --> 55:10.372
we come running to the rescue.

55:10.407 --> 55:12.041
I'm just going to fail again,

55:12.075 --> 55:14.543
and all I can think about
is basketball.
I can't concentrate.

55:14.577 --> 55:16.845
I can't remember
names and dates and stuff.

55:16.880 --> 55:20.716
Impossible! You know
every player's stats
that we've based all season.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.352
Well, I guess I just
think better
with a ball in my hand.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.122
Well, start dribbling.

55:27.157 --> 55:28.691
What?

55:28.725 --> 55:31.160
You dribble, we'll feed you
the names and the dates.

55:31.194 --> 55:32.494
You know, like stats.

55:32.529 --> 55:33.729
Third quarter,
20 seconds
on the stop watch.

55:33.763 --> 55:35.597
Who's the most
villainous player?

55:35.632 --> 55:37.800
Oh. King antiochus.

55:37.834 --> 55:39.568
Oh, go.
Take it, stick. Go.

55:39.602 --> 55:41.203
When did
the maccabees
reclaim their temple?

55:41.237 --> 55:42.938
You know,
win home court
advantage?

55:42.972 --> 55:45.908
B.C.E. 165.

55:45.942 --> 55:47.443
All right, uh,
what time of year?

55:47.477 --> 55:48.444
Tick, tick, tick...

55:48.478 --> 55:49.912
Oh, uh, kislev 25,

55:49.946 --> 55:51.447
3 years after
the fighting began.

55:54.484 --> 55:55.451
Schlots!

55:55.485 --> 55:57.286
Schlots!

55:57.320 --> 55:59.088
Schlots!

56:10.300 --> 56:12.868
Do you mind if I, uh...

56:12.902 --> 56:14.970
Dribble?

56:15.004 --> 56:17.639
You know, like,
an imaginary basketball?

56:17.674 --> 56:19.875
Whatever it takes.

56:33.590 --> 56:35.224
Hey, why aren't we
waiting for schlots?

56:35.258 --> 56:37.559
Not your problem.
Worry about your own game.

56:37.594 --> 56:40.662
Haven't you noticed?
We don't have a game.

56:40.697 --> 56:42.765
Without Alex, they
killed us yesterday.

56:42.799 --> 56:44.066
What?

56:44.134 --> 56:46.168
Circle up, my doubting dogs.

56:49.973 --> 56:52.107
It's time you get game.

56:54.077 --> 56:56.779
Now, a game starts with trust.

56:56.813 --> 57:00.549
When every dog
trusts himself
enough to try...

57:00.583 --> 57:02.518
Make a shot, snag a pass...

57:02.552 --> 57:05.187
Pretty soon, you start
trusting each other.

57:05.221 --> 57:06.655
You become a team.

57:06.689 --> 57:09.858
And when 5 guys
are playing together
as a team,

57:09.893 --> 57:12.361
ooh, it's the most
beautiful thing.

57:12.395 --> 57:16.365
Yeah! Because a team
is like a body.

57:16.399 --> 57:18.300
You got the feet
doing one thing,

57:18.334 --> 57:20.068
you got the arms doing another.

57:20.103 --> 57:24.239
Ha ha. But you guys,
everything is Alex.

57:24.274 --> 57:27.042
"Alex, Alex. Coach,
where is Alex?"

57:27.076 --> 57:29.878
It's like you got a head,
but no legs, no arms,

57:29.913 --> 57:32.147
no knees, no elbows, no nothing.

57:32.182 --> 57:34.483
That's all about to end today.

57:34.517 --> 57:36.752
And it stops with you.
Come on, t.J.

57:38.955 --> 57:41.089
How many technicals you got?

57:41.124 --> 57:42.191
I'm leading the league.

57:42.225 --> 57:43.659
Then, you're
taking yourself
out of the game.

57:43.693 --> 57:47.396
So, every time
you get mad
at the ref?

57:47.430 --> 57:48.931
I want you to think
of the sweetest
thing.

57:48.965 --> 57:50.432
Sweetest thing.
Yeah.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.734
Rebekah bloomberg.

57:52.769 --> 57:55.571
Ooh! Rebekah bloomberg.
All right.

57:55.605 --> 57:56.905
Ha ha.

57:56.940 --> 57:58.907
So, every time from now on,

57:58.942 --> 58:01.510
when you want to,
you know, take
the stripes off the ref,

58:01.544 --> 58:04.346
I want you to think
of your sweet thing
Rebekah bloomberg.

58:04.380 --> 58:06.548
That's right. Ha ha.

58:06.583 --> 58:08.584
Here you go.
Stick man...

58:08.618 --> 58:10.619
You're the arm.

58:10.653 --> 58:12.020
I want you to think...

58:14.757 --> 58:16.458
Hook....

58:16.493 --> 58:20.362
Hook...
Hook...

58:20.396 --> 58:22.397
Hook.

58:22.432 --> 58:25.200
Whoo!

58:25.235 --> 58:26.268
Joker, over here.

58:26.302 --> 58:28.704
You the mouth.

58:28.738 --> 58:31.206
Put it to work.
Trash talk your man.

58:31.241 --> 58:33.075
Make him so rattled
that he can't even stand.

58:33.109 --> 58:34.843
You're so slow,
they call you molasses.

58:34.878 --> 58:36.845
You're so fat, you need
2 pair of glasses.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.213
Oh!

58:38.248 --> 58:41.416
Ha ha ha.
Yes! Yes!

58:41.451 --> 58:44.086
Hey, coach, what part am I?

58:44.120 --> 58:47.589
Let's see... oh!

58:47.624 --> 58:49.358
You the butt, baby.

58:49.392 --> 58:50.425
The butt?

58:50.460 --> 58:52.728
You're the best
rebounding tool
we've got.

58:52.762 --> 58:55.797
I want you to think
wrecking ball.
Think bulldozer.

58:55.832 --> 58:58.267
Why can't
i just think
Rebekah bloomberg?

58:58.301 --> 58:59.768
'Cause you the butt, baby.

58:59.802 --> 59:04.206
Come on. Knock me out
of the key. Hit it, hit it.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.507
Oh!

59:05.542 --> 59:07.809
All right!

59:11.214 --> 59:12.214
Whoo!

59:12.248 --> 59:14.616
Yo!

59:14.651 --> 59:16.552
There you go!

59:19.222 --> 59:20.989
Tuck it!

59:21.024 --> 59:23.258
Yo! Sing me
the school song.

59:23.293 --> 59:25.327
♪ We are
the lions... ♪

59:25.361 --> 59:26.695
No, no, no.

59:26.729 --> 59:29.464
That's the old song.
I want the new song.

59:29.499 --> 59:31.166
The downtown version.

59:31.200 --> 59:34.169
It goes,
♪ you are the lions ♪

59:34.203 --> 59:35.437
♪ we are the lions ♪

59:35.471 --> 59:36.738

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.833
The envelope, please.

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:13.108
On the history test
that Mr. schlotsky
took this morning,

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:16.244
he received...

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.019
A b+.

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:27.923
Congratulations.

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.992
Go suit up.
Everybody.

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.426
We're cutting practice short.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.161
I've got to meet a friend.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.563
Boy: Really?
You have friends?

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.724
Oh! Very pretty.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:04.393
Yeah!

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:06.628
All right, all right.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.897
All: One, 2, 3, 4,

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.966
5, 6, 7, 8.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.367
O-oh!

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.236
Go, lions!

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:18.573
All right. Bring it in,
men, bring it in.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.079
Ok, ok. Yeah.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.981
I say my dogs are good to go.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:32.354
But, um, it turns out,
you going to have
to go on without me.

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.056
What?

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:38.060
Yeah. Last night,
i played a pick-up game
with an nba buddy.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:40.328
He talked
to some people,
and this morning,

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.797
the sixers called.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.198
Their back-up guard
went down,

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.500
and they want to sign me
to a 10-day contract.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.937
What's up with
all the long faces?

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.639
Thought my dogs would
be happy for me.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.474
We are, but what about us?

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:54.443
Yeah. What about
all the stuff you said

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.478
about our team
being a whole body?

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.751
Listen, practice hard,
play hard,

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:05.654
study hard. Take pride
in who you are.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.925
You'll be just fine.

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:12.260
Ok, guys, great practice.

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:15.097
Hit the showers.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:36.718
Alex: We won't do fine.
The tournament's in 2 days.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.420
I kept my word.

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:41.123
Deal was I would
coach you guys until
the sixers called,

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.591
and they called.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:47.963
Look, I know coaching
a bunch of kids
isn't the nba...

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:50.098
Listen to yourself.

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.000
You want me to
give up on my dreams
so you can have yours?

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.468
You were starting
to like coaching.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.669
I've been watching you.

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.171
Stop being so selfish, schlots.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:58.440
Think of somebody
besides yourself
for once.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:01.676
Why don't you start
thinking about someone
besides yourself?

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.145
What about your family?
What about them?

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.946
My family needs
for me to get
this contract.

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.215
They need me to pay the bills.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.351
Maybe they just need you.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.888
Like we do.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.062
I'm a hired hand here.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.964
After the tournament, then what?

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:25.967
I'm back on the streets.

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:29.771
Look, I owe you more
than I can say, Alex.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.208
But this is my shot.

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:35.277
And I'm going to take it.

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.055
All lamont needs
is a steady job.

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:50.392
I'm sorry. I can't recommend
that the academy hire
a full-time coach.

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:51.860
Why not?

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:54.563
Lots of reasons.
Money, priorities...

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.164
And you think
basketball's
a waste of time.

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:58.967
No. I think you're
wasting opportunities.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.236
You have the talent
and the resources
to do more, Alex.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.971
To be whatever you want.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.706
Well, basketball is what I want.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.974
Why can't you accept that?

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.709
You really want
to be like lamont?

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:10.045
A grown man
who abandoned his family

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:12.647
to chase after
some adolescent fantasy?

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.883
You don't know
anything
about lamont.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.552
You know even less about me.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:34.202
Rabbi Lewis:
The maccabees fought back,
with the odds overwhelming.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:38.573
The darkness that fell
over the land was
a spiritual darkness.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.743
And evil had penetrated
to the soul.

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:45.180
The temple had been ransacked,

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:49.417
the everlasting lamp
extinguished.

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:52.087
Now, light from
the everlasting lamp

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.388
would give the people comfort,

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.790
but there was only
enough sacred oil left

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.426
for a single day.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.363
Judah must've thought,
"what's the use?

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.765
"Why light a lamp
for a single day,

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:07.602
when so much more is needed
to give my people hope."

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.538
<i>Shalom.</i>

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.042
Good-bye.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.211
Bye.
Bye.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.918
Something on your mind, Alex?

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:25.220
Besides the yarmulke?

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.724
If the maccabees had lost Judah,

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.559
they would've been
massacred, right?

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:36.298
Perhaps people need
a strong leader.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.034
Our Judah's gone,

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.670
and so is any chance
of us winning
that tournament.

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:43.071
Maybe not.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:45.407
You mean lamont might stay?

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:49.744
I mean that perhaps
Judah's courage and leadership

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:52.147
isn't something we should
be searching for in others,

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.582
but in ourselves.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:03.692
You're saying i could be Judah?

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.862
Come on, I'm just a kid.

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.533
When Judah was asked
by his companions,

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:13.201
"how can we, few as we are,

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:15.670
fight back against
so great a multitude?"

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:20.875
Judah's reply was,
"it's not the size
of our army,

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:24.779
it is the strength
of our faith."

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.109
Announcer:
Philadelphia Hebrew academy

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.611
welcomes 16 teams.

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.580
Their friends and family,

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.750
for the 30th annual
Liberty tournament!

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.190
Yeah! Lions!

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.060
You know that's right.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.862
Whoo!

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:14.863
Yeah!

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.998
All right. 2 games
to the finals, dogs.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.501
We worked hard
to get here, and we
came here to win.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:22.037
So, let's go out
there and show them
our best, all right?

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.538
Let's go, team!
Come on!

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:25.240
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.941
Go, guys!

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:29.077
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.246
Ah! Oh!

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.547
Hey!

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.252
All right, my dogs,

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:38.920
this is our home court.

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.221
Let me hear it!

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.723
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.758
Come on, have I got
a bunch of chihuahuas here?

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.093
I said let me hear it!

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.428
All: Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:47.695
There we go.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.098
All right. Remember
the maccabees.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:52.667
Defense is our offense.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.036
And our defense starts
with a full court...

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.237
All: Press!

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.606
All right. Hands in.
"Lions" on 3.

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.375
1, 2, 3.

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.444
All: Go, lions!

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:03.478
Break!
Break!

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.679
Boys, let's go.

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:07.015
All right, let's go!
This is it!

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:09.617
All right.
Here we go, guys.

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:10.618
Marshall: Rabbi.

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:11.653
Oh, Marshall.

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:12.854
Ok.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.924
Boy: All right, guys.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.394
All right. Ready?

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:24.466
Alex: Nice, stick.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:26.901
Ok!

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:29.837
Hey!

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.142
Good "d"!

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.913
Break!

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.649
Defense, boys, defense.

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.218
Boy: Throw it here!

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.200
All: Go, lions!

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.173
Yeah!

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.075
I love you, Rebekah bloomberg!

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:09.978
Alex: Press!

01:09:27.962 --> 01:09:29.264
Boy: Come on.
Get it, get it!

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.633
Alex:
Come on, guys!
Yes! Nice, nice!

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.002
Uh!

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:38.173
Man: Time expired!
I saw that!

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.207
Alex will shoot 2 free throws!

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.341
Joker: All right, al.
You can do this.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.578
Stick:
Come on, schlots.

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.145
Hey, schlots!

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.148
Shh! Be quiet! Shh!

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.587
Yeah!

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.760
Boy: Do it!

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.730
Cheerleaders:
We got spirit. Yes, we do.
Come on.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:05.900
We got spirit.
How about you?

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:11.506
Yes!

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.441
We did it! We did it!

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.709
We did it!

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:15.677
Yeah!

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.645
We're going to the finals!

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:28.089
Alex.

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.361
Mom, I'm proud of you
being a doctor.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.762
Thank you.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.465
How'd you do?

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:39.801
We won.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.302
We're in the finals.

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.239
Congratulations.

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.776
Why don't you trust me?

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:51.179
What makes you think I don't?

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:54.182
You can't accept me
being anything but a doctor.

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:57.285
Honey, I just want
what's best for you.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.354
Look, being a doctor
is what's best for you,

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:00.588
maybe not for me.

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:01.556
Alex...

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.192
Look, I'm not an idiot, ok?

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:07.595
I know the chances
of me playing professional
ball are long...

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.230
Maybe even impossible...

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.099
But I still want you
to be proud of me.

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:13.601
I am.

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.073
At your bar mitzvah,

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:22.243
you took a step toward
becoming a man.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.412
But it was also a step for me...

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:27.615
A step toward...

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.284
Letting go.

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:32.587
And that can be
as hard as growing up.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:37.258
So help me to understand.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:42.563
What... What does
basketball mean to you?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.770
Ok, it's like this...

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.441
When I've got
the ball in my hand...

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:57.445
And I'm heading
down the court...

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:00.048
Everything around me
just disappears.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.917
Nothing else exists except
for me and the ball.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.919
It's like my whole entire life

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:07.922
is just wrapped up
in the one moment,

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.058
one pure moment in time

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.926
when it seems like the ball

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.562
just flies off my hands

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.798
and swishes into the net.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.071
Woman on TV: Severe
thunderstorms are expected

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.739
to blanket the Philadelphia area

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.574
tomorrow afternoon and evening.

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:29.644
Gusts up to 40 miles
an hour are expected.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.456
Hey, sweetie.
How you doing?

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.458
My knees are killing me.

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:47.261
The younger guys
are out-jumping me,

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.430
but, you know, I still
have some moves.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.266
Yeah.

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.436
Look, um...

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:58.139
The reason I'm calling is...

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.541
I've been doing
some hard thinking.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.045

Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:50.818
Good. Hmm!

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:57.158
I am so proud of
all of you guys.
All of you.

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.260
Hey, thank you, coach simowitz.

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:00.328
Or mister...

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:02.029
Ok. Carry on.
Carry on.

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.197
Ok, thank you.

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.199
All right.
Are my dogs ready?

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.869
All: Hoo hoo hoo
hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.270
Alex: This is
our doghouse now.

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.705
All: Hoo hoo hoo
hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.073
Alex: We're taking
off the leash.

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:13.341
We're going man to man,

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.642
with a full court...

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:15.710
All: Press!

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.845
All right. Hands in.
"Go, lions" on 3.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.247
All: 1, 2, 3!

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:21.516
Go, lions!

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.484
All: Warriors!

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.687
Warriors, go!

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:33.094
So you made it to the finals.

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.629
What a surprise.

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:35.763
First of many, Tyler.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.605
Alex: Go, go!

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.841
Yes!
All right! Nice!

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:47.842
Whoa!

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:48.843
Yes!

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.678
Oh, yeah!

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:51.679
Ha ha!

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:52.680
Boy: Defense!

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.781
Julie?

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.082
Thanks. You know what?

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:57.084
We can finish this up tomorrow.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.320
I'll give you a ride
to the game.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:01.255
I think we should
all give Alex
another chance.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.390
Don't you?

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:03.858
Starting with me.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.193
Come. I'll drop you
off at the school.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.162
Aren't you going
to watch Alex play?

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:10.831
There's something
i have to take care
of first.

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.135
Alex: All right,
this is it!

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:15.169
Stick 'em, stick 'em!

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:16.237
On the ball!

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.271
Go!

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.409
That's ok.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.244
The ball's out!
The ball's out!

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.046
Go! Go!

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.281
Come on!

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:28.916
Come on!

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:30.251
Ok, go!

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:32.019
Yeah.

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:36.857
Oh, hi!

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.492
Mrs. klein.

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:42.263
Rebound!

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:43.464
Yeah!

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.842
Defense! Come on!
Nice!

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:57.678
Put it up, stick.

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.047
Yeah!

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.649
Oh, yeah!

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.884
Yes!

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.720
Yay! Yes! Yes!

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:11.058
Crowd: Defense!

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.259
Defense!

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.201
Man: What's your name?

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.242
Boy: Thanks.

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.712
Girl: Would you
sign this, please?

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:34.882
Excuse me.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.884
I'm looking for a lamont carr.

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:39.253
Lamont? Good guy.
We just played him.

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:41.222
You check inside?

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:43.924
How tall are you?

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:44.925
6'9".

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.394
What would you say to someone

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:49.430
who was 14 years old,
5 feet tall,

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.965
and wants to be in the nba?

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:53.000
I'd say sign that boy up.

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.135
He's a big dreamer.

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:57.605
Can I get an autograph
for my son?

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.941
Motion 5!

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.610
Motion 5!

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.645
All right!
Let's go, let's go!

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.014
Way to play!

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:13.254
Let it go, teej!

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:14.588
Larry: Come on, boys!
Bring it back up!

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.223
We've only got...

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.625
Alex: What?

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.528
Boy: What's going on
with the lights?

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.229
Alex: Guys.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.870
Eugene?

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.548
Mr. carr.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.250
What happened?

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:44.752
I don't know.

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:45.720
It won't start.

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.054
I have to get to the airport.

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.022
It's got juice.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.724
I had this thing
totally rebuilt.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:50.958
It doesn't make sense.

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:55.930
Maybe it does.

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.865
Try it again.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.467
Why? Nothing's changed.

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:01.402
Just try it, please.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.087
I don't get it.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.261
I think I'm beginning to.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.203
I, uh... I called
the electrical company

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.872
and because of the storm,

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.140
we won't have power
till morning.

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:41.142
So that means we either...

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:44.411
We end the game now.
Right? Your team wins.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.013
Yes!
No.

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:49.717
Or... or we start
the emergency generator

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:52.353
and we play until
the fuel runs out.

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.221
How much time is that?

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:55.823
Eugene!
Huh?

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:56.824
How much time?

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.859
I teach algebra.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:01.595
Here.

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.399
Not too long. Look.
What?

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.401
The fuel's almost out now.

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:09.136
Ha ha ha!
Ow!

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.039
Larry: Let me get
something straight.

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:14.408
No matter who's ahead...

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:17.945
No matter
if there's still time
left on the clock...

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.013
Yeah.

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:21.315
When the generator's stops,
the game stops.

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.217
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, hey. We get it.

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:25.686
Just establishing
the rules, son.

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.455
Yeah.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:31.458
Warriors! Let's go!

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.427
Boy: We're playing.
All right?

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:34.762
Second boy:
Come on. Let's go.

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.630
One more quarter.
Let's go, guys.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.366
Boy: 18 points behind
and hardly any fuel.

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.936
We definitely need a miracle.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.411
Whoo!
Yes! Yes!

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:51.712
Do you hear me?

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.714
All right, boys.
Get in there.

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.416
Get in there!
All right!

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.351
Come on, boys!

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:58.819
Come on, everybody!

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.087
Let's go!

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.689
Let's go, lions!

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:02.690
Yes!

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.425
All: Let's go, lions!

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:11.065
Mr. simowitz?

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.633
You take it from here!

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:18.339
Did I mention that
i teach algebra?

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:31.085
Go. Let's go.

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:38.726
15 minutes?
The fuel will run out
way before then.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.394
We better work fast then.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.130
All right, team!
Come on, guys!

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:48.535
Get it! Get it!

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.681
Yes! Did you see that?

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:01.882
Yeah!

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.689
Boy: Stay on him!

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.825
Yeah!

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.028
Bring him around,
bring him around.

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.829
Go, joker! Go! Go!

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.266
Yes!

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:20.267
Yes!

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.835
Yes!

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:43.357
All right. Stay on him,
stay on him.

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.945
Ball! Ball!

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.347
All right! Go, go, go!

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.348
Go! It's on you!

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.449
Yes!

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.351
No! No!

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.621
Go, go, go!

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.223
Stay on him! Hands up!

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:18.359
Go! Yes! Ok!

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:19.727
Pass it right here.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:22.162
Time-out! Time-out!

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:23.864
Alex: Time-out!
Boy: Time, Alex.

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.666
Simowitz:
Good, good, quick.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.868
Lions, here.
Huddle, huddle.
Quickly, quickly.

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:29.036
Huddle. Over here.

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.204
Quickly.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:32.172
Uh... uh, I've got
the answer...

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.342
The whole fuel
flow generator thing.

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:38.012
I figured out exactly
how long it'll keep running.

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.079
You did?
Yes.

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:41.081
It was simple calculus, you see.

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.083
I measured the rate of flow

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:45.152
and then the voltage
in the tube.

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:48.055
Oh, the octane rating
and the r.P.M.S. Genius.

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.356
Can you show me?

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.725
Later. Mr. simowitz,
how long do we have?

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.029
Simowitz: Oh. Yes.
Well, the generator
will run out of fuel

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:59.066
in exactly... oy...
2 minutes and 45 seconds.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.568
Well, 44 seconds.

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.203
Well, 43 now, because
it keeps on every...

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:04.571
Let's go. Come on.

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.841
Alex: Ok. Let's go,
let's go, let's go! Hustle!

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:10.411
Time.

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.945
The time.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.881
Boy: Defense!

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:17.017
Time-out!

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:20.320
Tyler, what are you doing?

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.861
Ok. Come here, guys.

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.974
We had 'em.
We were coming so hard.

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.309
We had 'em.

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.111
I don't get it. Why'd
they call a time-out?

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.479
We just had a time-out.

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:47.548
They're stalling.
They want the generator
to run out of fuel.

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:48.649
They're ahead, they win.

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:50.250
Boy: Can they do that?

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:52.286
Second boy: That's not fair.
We were catching them.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320
Can they do that?

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.855
They can't do that!

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.356
Boy:
They just did, man.

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:58.192
Got 5 minutes left
on the game clock.

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:01.495
Lions. One minute.
One. One minute.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.063
One minute of fuel.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.842
So much for the miracle.

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.448
47 seconds.

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:23.016
46.

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.017
45.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.152
I got to...

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:31.959
42, 41, 40.

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:38.198
38,

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:39.566
37.

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.306
That's all? Hmm?

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:53.213
What's up with my dogs?

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.422
Schlots.

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.857
Hey, guys.

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.325
All right.

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:08.328
What's the long faces for?

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:09.530
They beat us.

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:10.898
Pardon me?

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:12.633
They took a time-out,
they ran down the clock,

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:13.901
and they beat us.

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.435
I see 5 minutes
left on that clock.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:19.006
Yeah. Well, there's less
than a minute of fuel
left in the generator.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.140
Says who?

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.475
Who cares?
The fuel runs out,

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:22.676
the game's over.
We lose.

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.311
Oh. Oh, I see.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:27.014
I see. So, I guess
that whole story

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.982
about the maccabees
was made up then, huh?

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.484
How about that part
about the light

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:32.486
in the temple that
was burning for 8 days?

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.987
I guess that was
just made up, too.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.956
Come on, ok, we're a little
too old for fairy tales.

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.990
We're done.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.259
20 seconds! 19...

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.260
18...

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:41.562
18...

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:43.697
17...

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.532
Are you done?

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:46.800
Boy: Yeah!

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.511
Tyler: Give it up,
schlots.

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.314
In your dreams, Tyler.

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:01.815
10 seconds.

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.317
9,

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.318
8,

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:06.320
Warriors: 7, 6,

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:09.356
5, 4, 3...

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.091
2...

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.226
1.

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:27.174
Yeah!

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.109
We win it!

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:30.711
Whoo-hoo!

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.383
Yes!
Ha ha!

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:47.361
Boy: Yes! Ha ha!

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.362
Whoo-hoo!

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.663
Yeah!

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.971
Let's go, dogs!
Get out there!

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.172
Come on!

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.008
Go!

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.342
This is our time!

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:03.543
Right now!

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:05.045
Aah!

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:07.981
Ohh!

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.376
Lamont: There you go!
There you go!

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:16.990
Alex: Ok! All right!

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:19.192
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.429
Boy: Defense! Defense!

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:36.176
Alex: All right, guys.
This is it.

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.017
Quick. T.J.! T.J.!

01:28:57.265 --> 01:28:59.533
Shake some Booty!

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:03.136
All right.
Man: Hustle! Hustle!

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:08.175
Lamont: Go down! Go down!
Set it up!

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.543
Come on!

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:26.993
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.195
Man: Hustle! Hustle!

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:33.367
Yes!
All right!

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.009
Boy: Come on! Come on!

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.013
Yeah!

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:00.560
You can do it!

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:02.529
Marshall: Come on, Alex!

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:03.597
Lamont: Come down.

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.471
Alex: All right!

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.907
Seconds left,
boys! Come on!

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.711
Watch the clock!

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.780
Alex, watch the clock!

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.148
Coach: You got 'em!

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.149
Knock them down!

01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:24.184
Come on, Alex.

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.218
Come on, Alex.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.319
Man: Shoot!

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.921
Come on. We have
no time left.

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:31.792
Shoot!

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.933
No!

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:07.394
Yeah!

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:08.528
Boy: Nice shot!

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:15.502
We just won!

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:19.039
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:23.710
We're the champions!
We're the champions!

01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:28.548
Congratulations.

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:32.285
I made it! You won!

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.587
Man: Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.822
Boy: Yes! Ha ha!

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:48.702
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:50.237
Yeah!

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:54.140
Look, baby, number one.

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.609
Yay!

01:31:57.812 --> 01:31:59.613
Aw, you were fantastic!

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:01.515
Thank you, doctor.

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:03.016
You're welcome.

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:05.151
My Van stalled on the way
to the airport.

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:07.087
Your mom agreed
to meet the plane

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:09.356
so I can bail
you sorry dogs out.

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:10.690
The plane? Whose plane?

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.858
Boy: Daddy!

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:17.364
Thanks, mom.

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.033
Cynthia:
You are welcome.

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.334
But you know what,

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:22.769
I still
say education
is important.

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:25.438
I still see a doctor
in your future.

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:28.542
Aw. Maybe it's
a doctor j.

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.043
Marshall: All right!

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:32.712
Cynthia: Of course,
that's only if I can
convince rabbi Lewis

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.881
to hire lamont as
a full-time coach.

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:35.982
You'd do that?

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:39.052
We got to keep
this mojo thing
going, right?

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.654
Well, what about the sixers?

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:44.324
Well, sometimes
you got to listen
to your new dreams,

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:48.828
bad knees,
and my little boy
who needs his dad.

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:54.734
Rabbi Lewis:
And so each year,

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.369
when the days grow short

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:58.405
and night
threatens to overwhelm,

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.140
we light the menorah

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:03.977
to remember the courage
of the maccabees...

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:05.579
But even more,

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:06.947
to celebrate the light

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:10.817
that miraculously
burned for 8 days...

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:15.355
The light that continues
to deliver us from darkness,

01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:17.290
to illuminate our dreams,

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:21.494
to turn strangers into friends

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:24.364
and to shine as a beacon of hope

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:25.699
to all the world.
