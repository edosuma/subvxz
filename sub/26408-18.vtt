WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:03.381
Previously onSEAL Team...You with the Services?

00:03.430 --> 00:05.603
Navy. You?

00:05.650 --> 00:06.958
Air Force.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.786
Ray.Christine.

00:08.830 --> 00:11.298
MILLER:
Davis, continue down
the corridor,

00:11.350 --> 00:14.001
extinguishing all flames
you encounter.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.267
NAIMA:
You're drinking too much,

00:15.310 --> 00:16.265
ignoring the family.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.526
This isn't the
man I married.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.185
This is the broken
sailor I found.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.790
I don't want that man to come
home from the Philippines.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.660
Look, Swanny, why don't you stay
at my apartment while I'm gone?

00:24.720 --> 00:26.324
You know, we're gonna deploy.Are you sure?

00:26.370 --> 00:28.019
Team guys, we got
to stick together, right?

00:29.370 --> 00:32.066
[phone ringing]

00:32.110 --> 00:33.452
ERIC:
He's in critical condition.

00:33.510 --> 00:35.159
We've airlifted him
back to the States.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.337
SONNY: You think whoever
this was, it was aimed at us?

00:36.380 --> 00:38.075
JASON:
Mandy gets the information,

00:38.120 --> 00:40.202
she gives that name to us first.

00:40.250 --> 00:44.380
MALE DOCTOR: Traumatic damage
to the femoral nerve in both legs.

00:44.430 --> 00:46.295
FEMALE DOCTOR:
...in both legs.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.079
The surgical grafts
and reconstruction...

00:48.130 --> 00:49.256
MALE DOCTOR:
The surgical grafts
and reconstruction appear

00:49.310 --> 00:50.698
to have been successful.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.389
Neural pathways...

00:52.440 --> 00:54.692
FEMALE DOCTOR: Neural pathways
may never heal completely.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.559
FEMALE DOCTOR 2: The ongoing
risk of sensation loss...

00:56.620 --> 00:58.485
MALE DOCTOR 2:
...risk of sensation loss
could compromise safety

00:58.530 --> 01:00.657
and mobility in the field.

01:00.710 --> 01:03.099
MALE DOCTOR 1:
Start a program of physical
therapy and rehabilitation...

01:03.150 --> 01:04.754
MALE DOCTOR 2:
...to regain strength...

01:04.800 --> 01:06.529
FEMALE DOCTOR 2: ...to regain
strength in your legs.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.400
FEMALE DOCTOR 1:
Clay, you have to accept
the real possibility...

01:08.450 --> 01:10.190
MALE DOCTOR 3: You have to
accept the real possibility...

01:10.240 --> 01:12.674
MALE DOCTOR 2: ...that you may never be able to operate again.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.551
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:28.260 --> 01:30.216
Moving a hell of a lot slower
than normal, fellas.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.955
That last training run should
have been cake for you.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.433
Instead,
you're dragging ass.

01:33.480 --> 01:34.435
Why do you think we're
dragging ass, huh?

01:34.480 --> 01:35.651
One of our best is out.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.429
News flash:
he got blown up, Blackburn.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.822
You remember that?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.438
Instead of going after
the bastards that got 'em,

01:40.490 --> 01:43.618
we're stuck here in the island
of suck, better known as Guam.

01:43.660 --> 01:46.220
Irony is, they call this
place the Island of Warriors.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.702
Yeah, well, warriors go to war.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.627
This ain't it.Yeah, it ain't war.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.626
When Mandy comes up
with a new target package,

01:51.670 --> 01:53.194
we will prosecute it...

01:53.240 --> 01:54.798
Mandy's a good idea fairy--
what the hell does she know?

01:54.850 --> 01:57.546
Until then,
we run the drill!

01:57.590 --> 01:59.581
Hey.

02:00.810 --> 02:03.722
Either of us worried about
where Sonny's head's at?

02:03.770 --> 02:05.465
No. I'm not worried.

02:05.510 --> 02:07.023
He's angry. We're all angry.
We're pissed.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.900
This guy, Shaw, what?
Moves us to Guam,

02:08.950 --> 02:10.554
away from the fight?

02:10.600 --> 02:11.862
Doesn't make it
any easner.

02:11.910 --> 02:13.298
Politically it was
the right call.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.510
Nobody makes that call.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.039
Including you,
you know that.

02:16.090 --> 02:17.739
Doesn't matter.Doesn't matter...

02:17.780 --> 02:22.217
As long as we're in this AO,
Shaw calls the shots. Period.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.749
You hear from Clay?

02:23.790 --> 02:25.655
It's been a month,
you know.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.359
Yeah. Nothing new.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.446
Reach out to him?

02:28.490 --> 02:29.616
Yeah. We reached out.

02:29.670 --> 02:30.921
All of us have
reached out to him.

02:30.970 --> 02:32.528
Radio silence.

02:32.580 --> 02:33.888
That makes me think
the worst.

02:33.930 --> 02:36.364
That's what concerns me.

02:52.950 --> 02:55.464
Morning, sunshine.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.729
How you feeling?

02:59.780 --> 03:01.953
[sighs] Like I've
been laying in bed

03:02.000 --> 03:05.265
for weeks
with a blown-up leg.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.437
Nurse says P.T. seems
like it's going well,

03:07.490 --> 03:09.003
left leg's doing great.

03:09.050 --> 03:12.053
She also mention
I can't stand when I pee?

03:12.100 --> 03:14.443
Would you rather
have a catheter?

03:16.580 --> 03:18.571
You know, you don't have
to keep coming up here,

03:18.630 --> 03:20.052
check up on me like this.

03:20.110 --> 03:22.670
Time you spend coming up here
is better spent

03:22.720 --> 03:24.756
looking for an EMT gig.

03:24.810 --> 03:27.984
You should get out there
and do what you love.

03:28.030 --> 03:30.373
Stopped doing what I love
when I got out.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.854
You know what I mean.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.289
Being cooped up here
with me sucks.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.776
Team guys look
out for each other.

03:38.820 --> 03:42.642
Look, if a job materializes,
I'll ghost you in a second.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.600
Till then,
I'm here to help.

03:44.650 --> 03:45.787
When I can't, I'll...

03:45.830 --> 03:48.651
I'll catch up on
my Jocko podcasts.

03:50.830 --> 03:55.574
Oh, you got a lot of missed
calls here, unread messages.

03:55.620 --> 03:58.578
You haven't responded
to any of these.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.623
Jason.Jason.
Sonny.Sonny.

04:01.670 --> 04:05.322
Sonny. Ray. Trent.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.884
Your boys are
worried about you.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.807
I'll call 'em
when I know I'm coming back.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.761
Well, you won't know for months.
Maybe...

04:12.810 --> 04:14.539
Even

04:15.600 --> 04:18.068
I'll call 'em then.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.606
Gunnery Sergeant Miller.

04:25.650 --> 04:28.642
MILLER:
Candidate Davis. Enter.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.570
At ease.

04:34.620 --> 04:35.962
What can I do
for you, Davis?

04:36.010 --> 04:37.705
With your permission,

04:37.750 --> 04:39.536
I'd like to request
special liberty.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.445
A friend from my old command
is in the hospital.

04:41.490 --> 04:45.574
The rest of the Team
is still in country.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.928
_ _The Crucible _
IS coming up again, Davrs.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.629
Shipboard firefighting.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.808
What was your malfunction
in there?

04:52.850 --> 04:54.283
Nothing, Gunnery Sergeant.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.934
I just choked, I guess.

04:55.990 --> 04:58.072
Negaﬁve.
What I saw was fear.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.940
You froze.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.458
That'd been a real scenario,
your actions would haven seen

05:02.510 --> 05:04.592
your shipmates injured
or killed.

05:04.650 --> 05:08.086
I'll grant
a special liberty.

05:08.130 --> 05:12.863
And while you're gone,
you should do some thinking.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.559
Fear is a hell
of a thing, Davis.

05:15.610 --> 05:19.876
If you don't slay it, you
will not make it through OCS.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.740
Not a chance in hell.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.534
JASON:
Here is to Commander Shaw

05:25.580 --> 05:28.845
for suggesting that we should
cut back on our drinking.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.666
All right. So top to him,
and top to bottom.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.449
Well, now, does that mean
that we're breaking the rules

05:33.500 --> 05:34.842
for drinking at this
establishment?

05:34.890 --> 05:36.938
RAY:
Oh, look at that.[players exclaiming]

05:36.980 --> 05:38.857
You ain't cheating the rules
if you ain't winning, Sonny.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.288
Oh, man, I'll tell you what.That correct?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.285
I-I-I-I really wish
that Clay was here right now.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.420
It doesn't feel right.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.721
You know,
I'm gonna give him a call.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.465
It's 5:00 a.m.
where he is, man, stop.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.681
Stop.Oh, you know his schedule?

05:48.730 --> 05:50.550
'Cause I sure
as hell don't.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.829
All you hear from Blackburn
is that he's stable. Okay?

05:53.870 --> 05:55.781
Well, stable-- stable how?

05:55.830 --> 05:58.219
I mean, that-that he's--
he can walk, that he talks?

05:58.270 --> 06:00.955
Convince the nurse
to gIve him a sponge bath

06:01.010 --> 06:03.308
and wax his baby chest?

06:03.360 --> 06:04.657
I just don't understand

06:04.710 --> 06:06.484
how he just can't return
a damn phone call.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.405
Sonny. His injury,
his recovery.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.179
Let him handle it the way
he needs to handle it.

06:10.230 --> 06:11.663
You got that?
I got it.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.189
I mean, you got to think
about the conversation

06:13.240 --> 06:14.844
on his end, right?
Yeah.

06:14.890 --> 06:16.801
Like, how would you feel if you
were laid up in the hospital

06:16.850 --> 06:19.899
listening to stories that we're
telling about kicking ass?

06:19.940 --> 06:22.852
Ray, this ain't
kicking ass, okay?

06:22.900 --> 06:24.458
This is sitting on our ass.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.502
Alls I'm saying is, just
give Spenser some time, G.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.209
You can't understand the
hell he's In, all right?

06:29.250 --> 06:33.038
All I'm saying is
I need to pee.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.297
He'll be fine.
Yep.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.908
Whatever you say there, Ray,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.918
'cause you can't pull without...[phone buzzing]

06:38.960 --> 06:41.861
Got to take another call?

06:41.920 --> 06:43.217
Uh, yeah.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.567
Yeah?
Yeah, you boys
take it easy.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.007
No.

06:48.050 --> 06:50.098
Again. Someone who's just
got to wreak havoc.
Yeah.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.698
I'm just trying
to lighten the mood.

06:51.750 --> 06:52.705
You're up, buddy.Ready?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.182
Before you even start,

06:54.230 --> 06:56.539
if you really enjoy embarrassing
yourself all the time...

06:56.590 --> 06:58.933
Watch and learn.
all you have
to do is show up anything...

06:58.980 --> 07:01.448
Ah! That's it.
See you later, buddy.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.809
Say that again.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.806
This just ain't gonna work.
Wait. Hold on.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.725
It's... 70-cent piece...

07:07.770 --> 07:09.590
Mind if I try?

07:11.210 --> 07:12.768
[chuckles] Sure.

07:14.910 --> 07:17.333
That's a longneck
with a $100 bill on it.

07:17.390 --> 07:19.346
Shh.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.381
Flake.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.038
Beginner's luck.

07:24.090 --> 07:25.910
No, I don't believe
that it's beginner's luck.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.871
I tell you what, hey,
let me buy you a drink.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.739
I already have one.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.963
Yes, you do.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.966
Okay, well, how
about a game of pool

07:33.010 --> 07:34.739
by the neon mermaid?

07:34.800 --> 07:37.360
[chuckles] Well, I'd like to,
but the table's occupied.

07:37.410 --> 07:40.368
I'm guessing there would
have been a wager.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.196
Oh, yeah.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.798
And the stakes?

07:43.850 --> 07:44.976
Loser buys the
winner breakfast.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.362
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

07:46.420 --> 07:49.059
Sounds like you would
have won either way, then.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.944
See you around.

07:54.990 --> 07:58.426
She just takes my $100 bill
like that.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.869
Are you kidding me?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.468
Hey, bartender. Can I get a...

08:04.520 --> 08:05.919
Can I get two more
of those Ishii beers?

08:05.960 --> 08:07.382
What is it--
How do you say Ishii?

08:07.440 --> 08:08.953
Yeah, that's it.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.820
Perfect. Thank you.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.131
Mandy.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.488
What in the hell
you doing here?

08:14.530 --> 08:16.054
I thought you
were in Manila.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.795
I was, and now I'm here.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.535
So I assume, by
you being here,

08:19.580 --> 08:21.093
it means that you
found a target?

08:21.150 --> 08:22.845
To give payback for what
they did to Clay?

08:22.890 --> 08:24.972
You want to keep
your voice down, Sonny?

08:25.020 --> 08:27.716
What?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.808
Simple yes or no, Mandy.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.806
This isn't the place
for that conversation.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.112
Thank you.
Mm. Of course,
that means

08:33.160 --> 08:35.060
that you didn't find
it yet, did you? No.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.769
It also means you're
still on the clock,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.208
which you shouldn't
be drinking, then.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.899
Don't piss me off, Sonny.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.383
Oh, really?

08:41.430 --> 08:42.988
Excuse me, ma'am.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.940
This guy bothering you?

08:45.000 --> 08:45.864
He's fine.

08:45.910 --> 08:47.127
Listen, Lumberjack Johnny,

08:47.170 --> 08:48.250
trees are outside, you
can start chopping.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.346
Wasn't talking to you.
Are you sure?

08:50.390 --> 08:52.039
Hey, fella.

08:52.090 --> 08:54.479
Take a walk. See you.

08:54.530 --> 08:58.045
[exhales] Guys.
[clears throat]

08:58.100 --> 09:01.445
You've been overserved.Oh, yeah?

09:01.490 --> 09:03.139
You should go.

09:03.190 --> 09:05.010
Well, I don't know if you've
checked your current location

09:05.060 --> 09:07.278
on this fine planet
known as Earth,

09:07.320 --> 09:11.882
but according to my GPS...

09:11.940 --> 09:15.808
being in my face is
a bad idea for you.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.067
Boop.Sonny.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.462
Don't touch me.

09:18.510 --> 09:20.978
Okay, I won't.

09:21.030 --> 09:22.588
Sonny, please stop.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.029
[belches]

09:25.080 --> 09:27.423
[grunting]

09:27.470 --> 09:30.997
[overlapping shouting]

09:38.140 --> 09:38.959
[knocking on door]

09:39.010 --> 09:40.739
Hey.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.872
Was gonna bring you a
lobster roll from Rhode Island,

09:42.930 --> 09:45.182
but I figured
this would travel better.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.107
Well, I like what you done
with the place.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.629
What are you doing here?

09:53.680 --> 09:56.194
Heard you got tagged.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.027
Figured I should come
check it out myself.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.373
How's, uh, how's OCS?

10:03.420 --> 10:05.945
About halfway through, right?

10:05.990 --> 10:09.994
Come on, you don't want to talk
about cake-eater camp, do you?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.769
What's going on?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.299
What'd the doctor say?

10:13.350 --> 10:15.989
Well, he said that...

10:16.050 --> 10:19.178
I'll either heal enough
to operate again or I won't.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.437
That's...

10:20.480 --> 10:22.482
That's the end of
the conversation.

10:23.710 --> 10:27.999
So... about you. OCS.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.221
Bet you're really owning
those other candidates, huh?

10:30.280 --> 10:32.180
Hardly.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.710
Think they're taking out a pool
to see when I'm gonna wash out.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.977
[scoffs]

10:37.020 --> 10:39.011
That's not gonna happen.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.538
Well, you never know.

10:41.590 --> 10:44.024
I mean, I could fail a test.

10:44.070 --> 10:47.460
Get rolled back. D.O.R.

10:47.510 --> 10:50.161
You thinking
about quitting?

10:50.210 --> 10:52.337
Crossed my mind.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.995
I mean, every day is one
reminder after another that

10:55.040 --> 10:57.031
most of what officers do
IS make deCISIons.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.081
All with consequences.

10:59.130 --> 11:02.429
Sometimes life or death,
and it's a scary responsibility.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.436
Yeah, that's

11:04.480 --> 11:06.482
what makes it matter,
why an officer is different.

11:06.530 --> 11:08.441
Yeah, but...No, but nothing.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.094
You're really gonna sit there
and tell me

11:10.140 --> 11:12.096
that you're thinking about
walking away from your dream?

11:12.140 --> 11:14.279
Whatever your

11:14.320 --> 11:17.790
problem is, it's in your head.

11:23.110 --> 11:25.101
[quietly]:
I'm sorry.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.428
Davis?

11:39.910 --> 11:43.038
Navy can't afford to lose
any of the good ones.

11:43.090 --> 11:45.786
Get yourself right.

11:55.190 --> 11:56.407
JASON:
You know, it's
exactly why

11:56.450 --> 11:58.270
I miss the carving
station at the RI.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.185
At least they got
cheesestea ks there.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.492
This is like a sloppy mess,
not even sloppy Joes.

12:02.540 --> 12:05.270
Here.What—what in the hell
is that sweet taste?

12:05.330 --> 12:08.060
It's coconut.
In the meat.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.249
Coconut in the meat?

12:10.290 --> 12:11.985
Mm-hmm.
What in the hell?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.986
I mean, you-you...
you do that

12:14.030 --> 12:15.509
to somebody
that you hate.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.902
These people--
they hate us.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.201
Who's they?

12:18.250 --> 12:19.467
The Gua... Guamanese—ese.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.817
Sorry. The who?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.292
Guamanians.Guamanians.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.999
That's what I said.The Guamanians.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.689
Let's be clear, Jace, okay?

12:27.740 --> 12:31.210
Coconut in meat-- ain't nothing
American about that.

12:32.270 --> 12:33.692
Oh, here he goes.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.047
[clearing throat]

12:37.490 --> 12:39.048
General Shaw found out

12:39.100 --> 12:42.228
about your little
off-campus dust-up last night.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.759
Thought I made it clear
that Bravo Team was

12:43.800 --> 12:45.279
under the microscope
right now.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.537
Well, I mean,
to be fair,

12:46.590 --> 12:48.103
I don't think
it was a dust-up.

12:48.150 --> 12:49.754
I think it was more of a,
uh, small, little, uh...

12:49.810 --> 12:51.289
You bored, huh?

12:51.330 --> 12:53.150
Um... you bored?

12:53.200 --> 12:55.327
Maybe your therapy sessions
will help fill up the time.

12:55.380 --> 12:56.631
[laughing]:
Did he say

12:56.680 --> 12:58.728
therapy sessions?
That's funny.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.499
Good.
All right.
That's great.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.209
Y-You're joking me, right?

13:02.250 --> 13:04.127
General Shaw feels
that meeting With a counselor

13:04.170 --> 13:06.218
at the Fleet and Family Support
Center would be productive.Come on.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.818
Yeah, I don't know about that.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.997
I heard that therapy-- that
could mess you up real good.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.654
JASON:
Therapy? Touchy feelings

13:11.700 --> 13:13.395
_ is not...
How IS that gonna help us out?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.305
News flash,
but that's not

13:15.350 --> 13:16.829
a touchy-feely job here.
You know that.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.393
Tell it to your psych.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.919
Appointments have been
made for each of you.

13:19.970 --> 13:21.574
Oh, this guy Shaw, man,

13:21.620 --> 13:23.793
he's just doing this stuff
right now to show he's boss.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.319
Ain't that the truth.

13:25.360 --> 13:29.057
Well, he isthe boss,
so suck it up.

13:29.110 --> 13:30.361
BRETT:
You got this.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.412
Welcome the pain.

13:32.460 --> 13:35.839
LUCAS:
You've come a long way
in four weeks, Clay.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.630
Only easy day was yesterday.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.069
How many more cheese-dick quotes
are you gonna spew at me?

13:41.120 --> 13:44.419
As many as it takes
to stop you dragging your ass.

13:44.470 --> 13:46.199
I'm dragging my ass
'cause my leg got blown

13:46.260 --> 13:48.387
into spaghetti
by some dirtbag.

13:48.430 --> 13:50.864
Aw, listen to this
little pity party, Lucas.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.639
He's cute, right?

13:52.700 --> 13:55.214
The body's a miracle machine.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.308
It's incredible
what it can overcome,

13:57.350 --> 13:59.398
given the right
treatment.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.873
LUCAS:
Why the face?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.876
Describe the pain.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.923
Okay.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.359
Well, he's about five-ten,
he's to my left,

14:08.410 --> 14:10.105
reddish hair, smells
like foot powder.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.310
Well, you forgot "handsome"

14:11.370 --> 14:13.270
and "a noble descendant
of the Scots."

14:13.330 --> 14:15.275
Does he _ever
stop talking?

14:15.330 --> 14:16.979
Looks like trying
to get away from him

14:17.030 --> 14:18.543
is all the motivation
you need.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.376
[sighs]

14:20.420 --> 14:22.411
[groans softly]

14:22.470 --> 14:23.721
Okay, okay, okay.

14:23.770 --> 14:25.328
You can sit now.Al| right, hold on.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.769
Let me just... Let me
hit him in the face first.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.596
Oh, good luck shifting your
weight between your legs, pal.

14:30.650 --> 14:33.380
Gonna kick me
while I'm down?[grunts softly]

14:33.430 --> 14:35.295
Well, you didn't like
the cheerleading.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.215
Taking a new approach.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.251
LUCAS:
The longer you two guys bicker,
the longer it takes me

14:39.310 --> 14:41.744
to inform Doc Roberts
that you've reached

14:41.790 --> 14:44.133
your inpatient
rehabilitation benchmark.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.396
Wait. Hold...
You mean that...?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.311
You're going home, pal.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.749
Your Majesty.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.406
[sighs]

14:56.460 --> 14:58.064
You're going home.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.891
DR. O'BRIEN:
My session today is
with Jason Hayes.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.283
I don't understand
why you're all here.

15:05.330 --> 15:08.242
Well, technically, Doc, you have
sessions with my team all week,

15:08.290 --> 15:10.599
so I figured, why not
just bring 'em all in

15:10.640 --> 15:12.596
on one day, knock it out?Mm-hmm.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.072
There you go. Boom.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.598
Or you figured
that-- I don't know--

15:16.650 --> 15:18.299
you could use your
friends as cover

15:18.350 --> 15:21.433
to avoid any chance of
substantive discussion?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.471
Maybe?Discussion?
What's he mean by that?

15:23.530 --> 15:25.134
You're Naw SEALs.
You're taught to never show

15:25.180 --> 15:28.434
pain, because,
emotional or otherwise,

15:28.490 --> 15:30.390
pain is thought of as...

15:30.450 --> 15:32.224
as weakness.

15:32.270 --> 15:34.738
You've experienced some
personal and professional losses

15:34.800 --> 15:38.270
recently, Jason,
not to mention a serious injury

15:38.320 --> 15:40.971
to one of your
men in a bombing.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.840
That's a heavy load to carry.

15:42.890 --> 15:46.451
Look, Doc, you know, you get
paid to talk about issues--

15:46.510 --> 15:49.320
find 'em, pull 'em out,
dissect 'em, whatever you do.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.984
I get paid
to overcome 'em, so

15:51.030 --> 15:53.021
I'm not seeing
a common ground here.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.980
Not all issues exist
in the field, Jason.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.428
Some live inside of us.

15:56.470 --> 15:58.518
Oh, careful, Jace.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.380
This is where, uh,
the voodoo starts,

16:00.430 --> 16:01.988
he tries to get
in your head.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.385
Sonny's afraid
of therapy.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.305
I ain't afraid
of nothing.So, the man who

16:07.350 --> 16:08.954
started a bar fight doesn't feel

16:09.010 --> 16:11.786
he could benefit _
from some Introspectlon?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.523
You say the word
"bar fight" like...

16:13.580 --> 16:15.525
like, it's a dirty word,

16:15.580 --> 16:17.354
like I did
something wrong.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.832
Didn't you?

16:20.450 --> 16:22.008
What about you guys?

16:22.060 --> 16:24.324
How did the bar ﬁght affect
the two of you?

16:24.370 --> 16:25.849
Well, you know,
it didn't impact Ray at all,

16:25.890 --> 16:27.369
because, he was taking a call,
right?

16:27.420 --> 16:28.978
And maybe he could have settled
Sonny down, but...

16:29.030 --> 16:31.157
RAY:
I should have know.
Jason relies

16:31.200 --> 16:33.373
on _me to take care
of everything, so...[clears throat]

16:33.420 --> 16:35.468
Right, I see.

16:35.510 --> 16:37.558
Yeah. Hmm.
[laughs]

16:37.600 --> 16:39.818
Okay.What's that
you see?

16:39.860 --> 16:42.420
Oh, just, uh, as a group,

16:42.470 --> 16:45.769
you model archetypical
familial dynamics.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.640
Authority figure, caretaker,

16:48.700 --> 16:51.305
goof-off.Oh, no, Ray's no goof-off.

16:51.350 --> 16:53.045
I meant Sonny.What?

16:53.090 --> 16:54.432
[laughter]

16:54.490 --> 16:56.173
Listen, you know what?

16:56.230 --> 16:58.050
I'm thinking that
we got a lot out of this.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.568
If it's good with you,
I think we'll take off,

17:00.620 --> 17:02.178
and, uh, you got
everything you need.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.879
Well...[clears throat]

17:03.930 --> 17:05.488
you still have 45 minutes.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.805
Awful long time to
sit in silence, guys.

17:08.850 --> 17:11.899
I'm pretty sure none of that
is what Shaw had in mind.

17:11.940 --> 17:13.896
Well, I feel a little different.
I feel a little lighter.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.453
How about you?No.

17:15.510 --> 17:18.024
You?That was the worst thing
I ever done in my life, man.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.298
Seriously.Al| right, take a minute.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.375
[scoffs]

17:21.430 --> 17:22.556
Oh, hi.

17:22.600 --> 17:26.422
Well, Dr. Julia Logan.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.947
Therapist?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.558
You're a patient.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.953
Prisoner. _
Here really not by ch0|ce.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.219
Ah... Jason.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.487
Didn't get a chance

17:36.530 --> 17:38.225
to introduce myself to you

17:38.270 --> 17:40.784
since you took my money
and ran off the other night.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.614
[laughing]:
I didn't steal anything.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.444
Yeah, you did.No. A bet's a bet.

17:44.490 --> 17:45.832
Okay.
Who knows?

17:45.890 --> 17:48.051
Maybe you'll have a
chance to win it back.

17:52.890 --> 17:54.755
Therapist, man.

17:54.810 --> 17:56.368
You got to be kidding me.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.639
The second bomb
outside the bar.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.854
Yeah, the one
that took out Clay.Yes.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.243
Image is too degraded
for facial recognition.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.074
NICA and CIA are
working on identifying

18:07.120 --> 18:10.123
anyone striking a resemblance
within the anti-Western

18:10.170 --> 18:11.865
and fundamentalist groups
in the region.

18:11.910 --> 18:13.514
And they've come up empty?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.344
Correct, but
we've just learned

18:15.390 --> 18:18.132
that the main charge
in both devices was ANFO.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.738
Fertilizer, diesel fuel?

18:19.790 --> 18:21.963
How does that help us narrow
down the list of usual suspects?

18:22.010 --> 18:24.649
Well, it doesn't, but it
helped me expand the search.

18:24.710 --> 18:26.701
I was able _to track
a large shipment

18:26.750 --> 18:30.493
of ammonium nitrate from
two weeks before the bombing

18:30.540 --> 18:31.700
to a site in Santa Rosa.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.274
Santa Rosa? Didn't know any

18:34.330 --> 18:35.888
of the fundamentalist groups
operate out of there.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.898
They don't, but the New
Resistance Force does.

18:38.940 --> 18:42.068
Armed faction of the Communist
Party of the Philippines?

18:42.120 --> 18:45.669
They don't target Westerners.
Seems thin.

18:45.730 --> 18:48.688
I thought so, too,
until NICA sent me the profile

18:48.730 --> 18:51.904
on the leader
of a relatively new NRF cell.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.647
This is the man
who took out Clay.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.353
So that's the dude responsible
for the bombing in Manila?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.573
NICA and the CIA
has identified him

19:08.620 --> 19:11.748
as a top dog in the
New Resistance Force.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.667
His name is
Armand Pacada.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.144
That's a dead man walking
right there.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.546
It appears the bomb was built
in an old molasses factory

19:20.590 --> 19:23.502
outside of Santa Rosa,
Philippines.

19:23.550 --> 19:26.769
The factory's been closed
for two years, but

19:26.810 --> 19:28.152
satellite photos
show steady traffic

19:28.210 --> 19:29.893
in the building the
last six months.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.759
NRF headquarters?

19:31.820 --> 19:33.515
At least one
of them, yeah.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.687
ERIC:
Mission is to
hit the factory

19:35.730 --> 19:37.686
and bring back intel--

19:37.740 --> 19:39.696
documents, hard drives,

19:39.740 --> 19:42.208
prisoners, anything
you can get.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.569
If you can find him,

19:44.610 --> 19:46.749
then we wrap up
Armand Pacada, too.

19:46.790 --> 19:48.872
I cannot wait
to make his acquaintance.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.742
The attack in Manila was
out of character for the NRF,

19:52.800 --> 19:56.224
so there's a bigger picture
here that we're not seeing.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.407
I want Pacada

19:58.450 --> 20:01.795
brought in for interrogation,
so no hole in his head.

20:01.850 --> 20:03.010
You know we can't
guarantee that.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.288
The bad guys kind of
have a say in the fight.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.798
ERIC:
Filipinos have authorized us
to prosecute the operation.

20:07.850 --> 20:11.206
Commander Bayani will be
your liaison on the ground.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.945
JASON:
What are you thinking, Ray?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.981
Factory's surrounded
by brush and trees.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.941
Offset infil makes sense.Mm-hmm.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.685
Take indig vehicles
to the set point,

20:18.730 --> 20:20.334
roll to the target on foot.

20:20.390 --> 20:22.733
Them Stalin-humpers ain't
gonna know what hit 'em.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.771
Right. Remember,

20:24.830 --> 20:26.991
the objective is
to gather intel

20:27.050 --> 20:29.564
and bring Pacada back
from the Philippines

20:29.610 --> 20:30.952
alive.

20:31.010 --> 20:33.968
Hey, Mandy, uh...

20:34.010 --> 20:37.229
look, I was out of
line the other night,

20:37.270 --> 20:39.226
and, well, um...

20:39.280 --> 20:41.840
I just want to
tell you that...

20:41.890 --> 20:44.324
I'm-I'm sorry.

20:44.370 --> 20:47.976
You know, you get her done,
as you always do, and,

20:48.020 --> 20:51.069
well, now it's our time
to get payback for Clay.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.810
Okay. Thank you
for the apology.

20:55.860 --> 20:58.158
I'm in therapy.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.039

Bravo 1,

21:18.620 --> 21:21.316
this is Havoc Base.
I copy Faraday.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.889
JASON:
Bravo 2, split left.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.750
RAY:
Copy that.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.198
ERIC:
Bravo 1, be advised,

21:34.240 --> 21:38.540
ISR shows two individuals

21:44.390 --> 21:46.335
Copy that. Anyone else?

21:46.390 --> 21:47.994
Negaﬁve.

21:51.870 --> 21:52.734
Bravo 2,

21:52.780 --> 21:54.736
how's everything on your side?

21:54.790 --> 21:55.825
Good to go.

21:55.870 --> 21:57.269
Stand by.

21:57.310 --> 21:58.789
Can you friggin' believe

21:58.830 --> 22:00.388
there are_sti|| commies
in this world?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.396
Don't these idiots
read history books?

22:04.880 --> 22:06.484
I'll take left, you take right.

22:06.540 --> 22:08.667
On your one.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.530
Execute, execute, execute.

22:16.370 --> 22:18.019

22:34.740 --> 22:36.048
[gunfire and shouting]

22:48.970 --> 22:50.358
Looks like jackpot to me.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.832
Not till we get Pacada.

22:51.890 --> 22:53.050
All right, let's go.

22:53.110 --> 22:56.409
Get all the intel. Pack it up.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.416
Havoc, this is 1.

23:35.970 --> 23:37.449

23:37.500 --> 23:39.456
Uh, where you
going, son?[grunts]

23:39.500 --> 23:41.456
RAY:
1, this is 2.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.809
Area clear. We have HVT.

23:43.850 --> 23:45.579
How copy?Copy, 2.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.892
Target secure. Move to us.

23:47.940 --> 23:48.929
Copy.

23:48.990 --> 23:50.639
On the move.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.681
On me.

23:55.650 --> 23:56.901
Havoc, this is 1.

23:56.950 --> 23:58.679

24:03.790 --> 24:06.350
Blue, blue, blue!

24:06.400 --> 24:08.345
Chicken Piccata here
made a phone call

24:08.400 --> 24:10.391
before we grabbed him.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.795
Hmm?

24:16.840 --> 24:18.796
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.843
Hey, he's not gonna talk.

24:25.070 --> 24:26.196
What happened?

24:26.240 --> 24:28.845
Fell down.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.891
Havoc, this is 1.
HVT may have

24:34.950 --> 24:36.508
gotten off a call
before we secured him.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.164
A-firm, Bravo 1.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.338
Be advised,
ISR shows two vehicles inbound,

24:41.390 --> 24:43.824
five klicks east of your pos.

24:43.870 --> 24:47.089
Estimated time,
ten minutes till they reach you.

24:47.130 --> 24:48.347
The objective is Pacada.

24:48.390 --> 24:50.005
They have him. I need him.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.394
Bravo 1,
I suggest you finish your SSE

24:54.440 --> 24:58.262
and bring the HVT in
before those vehicles arrive.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.788
Already pushing our ROE.

25:00.840 --> 25:04.139
Last thing we need
is a major contact.

25:04.190 --> 25:06.238
SONNY:
RTB?

25:06.280 --> 25:08.328
Pacada's cell's
looking for a fight.

25:08.370 --> 25:10.804
I say,
come get some.

25:10.850 --> 25:13.159
You're thinking we set a trap?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.020
More like an ambush.

25:15.070 --> 25:17.595
What are the odds we get another
chance to take out that cell?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.165
Ray's right. We take them out,
we save more lives.

25:21.170 --> 25:23.331
Yeah. I know.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.335
So what's the
plan, boss?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.608
Let's do it. Payback.

25:27.650 --> 25:29.129
Hardpoint.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.081
Everybody else get
ready for SSE, huh?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.564
We're fighting.
Five minutes.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.132
Havoc, this is 1.

25:37.180 --> 25:39.489
We got a target
of opportunity.

25:39.530 --> 25:41.532
We're staying put.

25:43.410 --> 25:46.402
Copy that, Bravo 1.
Standing by.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.338
[clears throat]

26:02.380 --> 26:04.644
You can leave that shower chair
in the hall, man.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.510
I have no_intentions
of usmg it.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.289
When you're older and wiser,

26:08.340 --> 26:11.343
you'll realize that standing
in the shower is for chumps.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.254
Um...

26:15.310 --> 26:16.607
You hang out here for a sec.

26:16.660 --> 26:18.434
I-I forgot
you were coming home today.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.482
The place is a dump.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.304
I spent multiple deployments
sharing a room with Sonny.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.089
Look, nothing's
gonna shock me.Yeah.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.744
Well, it'll take me
30 seconds, huh?

26:25.800 --> 26:27.665
Swann, I really need
to get off my feet, man.

26:27.710 --> 26:30.406
Yeah, yeah,
sure, sure.

26:30.450 --> 26:32.975
Here you go.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.749
Hey.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.768
Home sweet home, huh?

26:37.810 --> 26:39.505
What is this?

26:39.550 --> 26:42.542
Uh, it's just my little system
to remember stuff

26:42.600 --> 26:44.374
now that I have
no Wives to nag me.

26:44.420 --> 26:48.686
Uh, I'm really sorry
about the mess, huh?

26:48.730 --> 26:51.517
You should, uh...

26:51.560 --> 26:54.472
Maybe you should
call Dr. Sullivan.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.083
Yeah, Ijust...

26:57.130 --> 26:59.439
just want to get used
to being home for a minute,

26:59.480 --> 27:00.469
you know what I'm saying?

27:00.530 --> 27:02.430
Hey! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.095
Hey, you push too hard,
you'll make yourself worse.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.098
Come on, how can it get
any worse than this, you know?

27:08.140 --> 27:09.619
Well, it can, fast.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.013
Look, I know you want
a full recovery.

27:12.060 --> 27:14.016
You got to find that zone
between doing nothing

27:14.060 --> 27:16.528
and trying to... trying
to do everything at once.

27:16.590 --> 27:17.534
You got to...

27:17.590 --> 27:19.410
just...

27:19.460 --> 27:21.416
You got to
pace yourself.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.416
Take it easy.

27:23.460 --> 27:26.281
You speaking
from personal experience?

27:29.290 --> 27:30.769
These all yours?

27:30.820 --> 27:33.209
See how many pills
you're popping

27:33.260 --> 27:34.864
after you've done
a dozen deployments.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.127
Consider me

27:36.170 --> 27:38.422
a cautionary tale.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.617
Everything okay with NICA?

27:48.660 --> 27:51.356
They weren't thrilled about
the Teams staying on target.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.051
They're not the only ones
who feel that way.

27:54.100 --> 27:57.365
Yeah, well,
you'll get your intel.

27:57.410 --> 28:00.584
The objective is the objective
for a reason.

28:00.630 --> 28:03.417
Dismantling that cell
is a target of opportunity.

28:03.460 --> 28:06.759
One that played right
into their need for revenge.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.336
[sighs]

28:11.380 --> 28:13.985
Eric...

28:14.040 --> 28:16.201
I get it.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.332
I was at the bar.

28:18.390 --> 28:21.348
But this isn't
just about Pacada.

28:21.390 --> 28:23.733
There's a bigger picture
that we're not seeing yet.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.431
And what I need
is still in that factory.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.607
It's in Pacada's head.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.560
And without it,

28:30.620 --> 28:32.747
the trail goes cold.

28:32.790 --> 28:35.441
They won't let you down.

28:36.450 --> 28:38.441
I hope not.

28:57.860 --> 29:00.169
[insects trilling]

29:02.520 --> 29:05.250
Man, I sure wish
Golden Boy was here

29:05.300 --> 29:08.952
to see the takedown
of all takedowns.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.525
Yeah, me, too.

29:14.310 --> 29:16.699
You think
he's gonna come back?

29:18.320 --> 29:21.050
Sonny, you got something
on your mind, don't you?

29:21.100 --> 29:24.752
If you do, you better share it
before these boogers come out.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.489
You know, uh...

29:27.540 --> 29:30.065
while I was stuck
in the sub, um,

29:30.110 --> 29:32.499
I said something to him,

29:32.550 --> 29:34.541
about going all in, and...

29:34.590 --> 29:38.503
Itold him. I said,
"That's who we are."

29:38.550 --> 29:43.169
That's when he started
sleeping in the cages and...

29:43.210 --> 29:45.861
getting after it harder.

29:45.910 --> 29:49.255
And I believe that's why he ran
out and saved those people.

29:53.570 --> 29:57.438
I think that I put him
in the path of the bomb.

29:57.490 --> 29:59.219
Listen, Sonny, stop, all
right? Clay wanted to help.

29:59.270 --> 30:01.135
He ran to the danger.
That-That's what we do,

30:01.190 --> 30:02.134
run to danger.

30:02.190 --> 30:03.748
Yeah, but I-I should've...

30:03.800 --> 30:06.143
pulled him back a bit,

30:06.190 --> 30:08.533
said something, and I didn't.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.753
You need reining in,
that's on me.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.756
That's my responsibility.
All right?

30:12.810 --> 30:14.971
Listen, Sonny,
one more thing.

30:15.030 --> 30:18.193
Next time, talk to me before you
take it out on an HVT's face.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.763
Got it?

30:24.770 --> 30:27.898
That wasn't me, Jace.

30:27.950 --> 30:30.168
Ray?

30:32.610 --> 30:34.566
Something ain't right.

30:34.610 --> 30:39.434
And, to be honest,
I'm worried about him.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.438
I'm only saying this
because maybe it's something

30:42.490 --> 30:44.651
our team leader
needs to rein in.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.574
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.759

three mikes out.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.621
Good copy.

30:59.810 --> 31:01.323

31:17.000 --> 31:18.388
[shouting]

31:19.960 --> 31:21.734
Shift fire!

31:25.840 --> 31:27.398
[tires screeching]

31:28.840 --> 31:31.536
Move through! Move through!

31:51.560 --> 31:52.595
[shouts]

32:03.130 --> 32:04.654
Set security!

32:04.700 --> 32:06.395
Check for known dead.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.431
SSE tangos and trucks.

32:14.540 --> 32:17.054
Ray, check on Pacada.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.886
Bayani, you're with me.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.750
Ray, let's go.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.331
Bravo 2 to Havoc Base.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.848
Our HVT has escaped
his hardpoint.

32:38.910 --> 32:40.730
We lost Pacada.

32:57.620 --> 32:59.838
All stations, he's on foot.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.369
Can't be far.

33:02.890 --> 33:04.050
Jace.Yep.

33:04.110 --> 33:06.101
We got a blood trail.Go.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.980
They'll find him.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.167
And if they don't?

33:25.220 --> 33:27.472
They'll find him.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.668
[grunts]
Ray!

33:44.710 --> 33:47.531
RAY:
Yep.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.319
[screams]You're lucky
it wasn't me.

33:49.370 --> 33:52.589
Jackpot. Havoc, this is 1.
Passing Curie. Again.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.155
Copy that, Bravo 1.
Passing Curie.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.151
[sighs]

34:00.600 --> 34:01.851
The threat of mutiny and
uncertainty of the mission

34:01.900 --> 34:04.812
was constant, driven
by fear of the enemy.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.589
Of the unknown.

34:06.650 --> 34:09.551
And yet this ragtag
army held together.

34:09.610 --> 34:11.214
They completed the march,

34:11.260 --> 34:13.080
they reached Derna,

34:13.130 --> 34:15.917
and against a vastly
superior enemy position,

34:15.960 --> 34:17.211
they took the city.

34:17.270 --> 34:20.740
Do you know what
held them together?

34:20.790 --> 34:22.746
Leadership.

34:22.790 --> 34:26.920
The_will to _make_ decisions
in impossmle Situations

34:26.970 --> 34:30.531
against improbable odds.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.536
Moral authority quelled
the whispers of mutiny.

34:33.590 --> 34:37.936
Vision kept the mission alive
through 600 miles of wasteland.

34:37.980 --> 34:39.936
And courage...

34:39.990 --> 34:42.629
courage compelled the charge
through heavy musket fire

34:42.680 --> 34:44.591
that broke the enemy defense.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.642
Those same qualities

34:48.690 --> 34:52.558
that won the very first
American victory on foreign soil

34:52.610 --> 34:55.386
214 years ago

34:55.440 --> 34:58.785
are the same required
of you here today.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.741
Honon

35:00.790 --> 35:02.610
Courage.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.480
Commitment.

35:04.530 --> 35:07.397
These are the core values

35:07.450 --> 35:11.056
that provide the moral authority
to lead.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.796
And you must draw upon it
not only in your career

35:13.850 --> 35:15.659
but in your life as well.

35:15.720 --> 35:20.066
Because, make no mistake,

35:20.110 --> 35:21.896
an officer who can lead others

35:21.940 --> 35:25.467
but not himself or herself

35:25.510 --> 35:28.297
is no officer at all.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.291
Davis!

35:37.830 --> 35:39.775
You had some time to think?

35:39.830 --> 35:41.786
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.786
I need to find out.

35:43.830 --> 35:45.525
If I have what it takes.

35:45.570 --> 35:48.528
Well, that's one thing
I can guarantee you.

35:48.580 --> 35:53.051
That you will find out
if you have what it takes.

36:04.030 --> 36:06.021
ERIC:
Hey.

36:07.990 --> 36:10.766
Feel better?

36:10.820 --> 36:14.722
Uh... well,
we got the guy that hurt Clay.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.943
Probably stopped
some more bombings.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.438
So, yeah.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.789
I do feel better.

36:34.060 --> 36:36.358
You're quiet, Ray.

36:37.410 --> 36:39.833
Not much to say.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.846
Hmm.

36:42.890 --> 36:45.017
Why don't you tell me a story.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.847
Tell me a story about
what happened to Pacada's face.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.856
He hurt Clay.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.891
I hurt him back.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.760
And that's all
that's going on with you?

36:57.990 --> 37:00.299
That's all.

37:00.340 --> 37:03.127
I don't believe that.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.791
[grunting]

37:26.110 --> 37:28.101
What are you doing, man?

37:29.810 --> 37:32.153
Uh, I'm try... My le...

37:32.200 --> 37:34.543
This damn leg isn't letting me
reach this high.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.898
Can you get this flag down
for me?

37:36.950 --> 37:39.817
Why the redecorating?
I-I like it there.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.811
I'm not on Bravo anymore.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.693
I don't... I don't keep pictures
of my ex-girlfriends

37:47.740 --> 37:49.162
laying around, either.

37:49.220 --> 37:51.211
[sniffles]

37:52.220 --> 37:54.825
Look, when I left
the Teams, it sucked.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.179
Some days I, I couldn't ﬁnd
a reason to get out of bed.

37:58.230 --> 38:01.188
Thinking of them out there,
dropping the hammer...

38:01.230 --> 38:03.664
itstough.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.315
At least you got to leave
on your own terms.

38:06.370 --> 38:08.099
Only one acting

38:08.150 --> 38:10.277
like you're leaving is you.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.197
The doctors haven't ruled out
clearing you to operate.

38:13.240 --> 38:14.889
Navy hasn't
discharged you.

38:14.940 --> 38:17.852
Teammates haven't
given up on you.

38:17.900 --> 38:21.028
Hold on to Bravo
as long as you can,

38:21.080 --> 38:23.719
'cause when you're really out...

38:23.770 --> 38:26.295
you'll realize the Team

38:26.340 --> 38:28.296
was everything you had.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.256
Flag stays put.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.965
[Ray and Christine
speaking indistinctly]

38:42.010 --> 38:43.045
Searching for me...

38:43.100 --> 38:44.658
Yo.

38:44.710 --> 38:46.052
And another.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.965
And, uh, you want something?

38:48.020 --> 38:49.965
No, I'm good.

38:50.020 --> 38:53.797
I guess you got me,
yeah, you got me...

38:53.850 --> 38:56.751
Not that I'm counting,
but that's your fourth?

38:57.810 --> 38:59.232
What's going on?

38:59.290 --> 39:00.803
Until I took you from her...

39:00.860 --> 39:02.851
I don't know.

39:03.860 --> 39:06.636
If I was me,
I'd probably know, but, uh...

39:06.690 --> 39:08.908
I'm not, so I don't.

39:08.950 --> 39:11.862
Okay, that might be your fifth,

39:11.910 --> 39:14.549
'cause you're not making
any sense.

39:14.610 --> 39:18.603
Christine, the real Ray Perry...

39:18.660 --> 39:22.005
would never lose control
of his emotions like that.

39:22.050 --> 39:25.577
The real Ray Perry,
he turned the other cheek

39:25.620 --> 39:29.966
'cause he trusted that vengeance
belonged to God and God alone.

39:30.010 --> 39:33.889
And-and that his own hands
couldn't heal your wounds.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.886
Or Clay's.

39:35.930 --> 39:38.273
But this Ray...

39:38.330 --> 39:40.798
[scoffs]

39:40.850 --> 39:43.455
I couldn't deliver payback
fast enough.

39:43.510 --> 39:45.637
And what did it get me?

39:46.640 --> 39:50.371
So you feel bad
about what happened.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.159
I don't feel nothing.

39:53.210 --> 39:55.166
Your heart's not in it...

39:55.210 --> 39:58.168
Pretty sure that's worse
than feeling bad.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.859
With the dark drums...

40:00.920 --> 40:04.083
I'm pretty sure
you're right.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.563
She doesn't know just how...

40:06.620 --> 40:07.564
You know what?

40:07.620 --> 40:10.009
One more for me, please.

40:10.050 --> 40:12.314
Thought you didn't want another.

40:12.360 --> 40:16.444
State you're in, can't
let you drink alone.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.445
I got you where I...

40:18.500 --> 40:21.060
Well, Shaw did one good thing.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.624
That's transfer
your unit here, too.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.500
[chuckles] I guess so.

40:26.550 --> 40:29.110
This way we can continue
our talks.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.889
To steal your heart away...

40:30.950 --> 40:31.894
Yeah.

40:31.950 --> 40:35.647
From my arms

40:35.690 --> 40:39.478
From my arms
there's no escape

40:39.520 --> 40:43.900
I got you
where I want you now

40:43.960 --> 40:47.134
My love's gonna
make you stay

40:48.570 --> 40:50.526
Make you stay...

40:50.570 --> 40:52.481
Well, look who it is, huh?

40:52.530 --> 40:55.488
Open pool table.
That means I get a chance

40:55.540 --> 40:58.441
to win my $100 back?
What do you think?

40:58.490 --> 41:01.539
Ah. Double or nothing?

41:01.580 --> 41:03.013
Sounds good.
Looks like I'll be having

41:03.060 --> 41:04.937
a fancy breakfast
in the morning.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.198
My break.

41:09.030 --> 41:11.988
Really? Shrinks never discuss
patients with each other?

41:13.030 --> 41:14.725
Well,

41:14.770 --> 41:16.852
not by name.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.071
I knew it, see?

41:18.120 --> 41:20.384
You wouldn't like
my whole take on therapy.

41:20.430 --> 41:22.512
Well, it's not for everybody.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.516
Kind of like hockey.Oh, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.518
[chuckles]
Those are fighting words, now.

41:27.570 --> 41:32.303
I'm just saying, hockey
is all about brute force.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.527
Where pool, on the other hand,

41:35.580 --> 41:40.005
requires finesse,

41:40.060 --> 41:42.494
dexterity,

41:42.540 --> 41:46.010
attention to detail...

41:46.060 --> 41:48.016
and patience.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.451
Impressive. But, you know,

41:52.510 --> 41:55.115
hockey's not just
about brute force.

41:55.160 --> 41:59.119
You need speed, endurance
to put the puck in the net.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.378
Hmm. I don't know.

42:01.430 --> 42:03.990
All those penalties,
lots of time to rest.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.429
It's fun in the penalty box.
You should try it.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.476
You missed that. My shot.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.215
Hey, don't expect him
to take it easy on you

42:12.260 --> 42:13.784
just because you're a girl.

42:13.830 --> 42:15.479
I'd walk away if he did.

42:15.530 --> 42:17.179
JASON:
What about your friend there?

42:17.230 --> 42:19.790
She's not gonna
play pool with us?

42:19.840 --> 42:21.523
SONNY:
Good thing it's happy hour.

42:21.580 --> 42:24.310
Yeah. Hey, look who I got here.Who you got?

42:24.360 --> 42:25.964
Look who I got right here.Yeah!

42:26.020 --> 42:29.103
[all cheer]

42:29.150 --> 42:31.402
Hey, look at you,
man. Good to see you.[laughs]: Yeah, boy.

42:31.460 --> 42:32.677
Yeah, man.

42:32.720 --> 42:35.188
It's good to see you, too, man.

42:35.240 --> 42:38.118
Hey, I'm, uh...

42:38.160 --> 42:40.116
Look, I'm sorry I didn't...

42:40.160 --> 42:41.809
didn't get back to y'all.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.339
JASON:
Don't matter, man.

42:43.380 --> 42:44.688
All that matters is
you're home right now.

42:44.730 --> 42:46.243
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right?

42:46.300 --> 42:48.814
Got my eye
on my first outpatient rehab

42:48.870 --> 42:50.599
in a couple hours here.

42:50.650 --> 42:51.776
What's going on over there?

42:51.830 --> 42:53.218
SONNY:
You know, not much.

42:53.260 --> 42:55.478
Mandy, uh, found the guys
who did it,

42:55.520 --> 42:57.522
and we, uh... we handled it.

42:57.570 --> 42:59.049
I bet y'all did.

42:59.090 --> 43:01.263
Wish I could've been there.

43:01.310 --> 43:03.449
You were here, man.
You're always here.
