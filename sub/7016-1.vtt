00:02.302 --> 00:04.468
Previously on
That 70's Show...

00:04.505 --> 00:05.695
Wow, uhm

00:05.995 --> 00:08.498
you're gonna take a job
and move to Chicago ?

00:08.520 --> 00:11.218
Well, I'm willing to give it
all up and stay here with you.

00:11.384 --> 00:13.074
But if I do that,

00:13.943 --> 00:15.990
I need to know we're
gonna get married.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.491
Well I don't know what
to say right now...

00:20.076 --> 00:22.789
She took the job in Chicago
and she left this morning.

00:23.399 --> 00:26.241
Check check check, no one can see us
doing it from the parking loAAAAHHH !

00:29.336 --> 00:30.392
You're dead !

00:34.652 --> 00:35.958
I'm NUDE !

00:43.908 --> 00:48.034
Mrs. Forman, what a great idea making
a tape to send to Eric in Africa !

00:48.088 --> 00:51.198
Oh please, I am
full of great ideas !

00:52.307 --> 00:56.103
When he went to camp, I sent him
a huge card with my face on it

00:56.135 --> 00:58.460
that says "Mommy loves you".

00:59.427 --> 01:03.383
Well it made him miss me so much he
begged to come home the very next day.

01:03.885 --> 01:06.851
Ah yes, the summer of
a thousand wedgies...

01:08.337 --> 01:12.012
Eric is gonna be so excited
to hear some familiar voices.

01:12.076 --> 01:14.163
OH ! I do Porky Pig

01:15.265 --> 01:17.500
Hababadahababada,
that is all people !

01:22.376 --> 01:23.313
Is Hyde here ?!

01:24.086 --> 01:26.082
No Michael, you're safe.

01:26.218 --> 01:29.801
We still haven't heard from Steven
since he left Chicago a month ago.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.672
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

01:31.695 --> 01:34.330
Hyde could show up any
minute and kick my ass.

01:35.187 --> 01:38.611
I really need a soda cause I
just ate a whole bunch of salt.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.761
Why is it so good ?

01:43.195 --> 01:45.131
I don't know, why don't you ask
Hyde, he is right behind you...

01:45.168 --> 01:46.041
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
!

01:48.595 --> 01:50.221
It's not even funny !

01:53.038 --> 01:54.481
Okay then,

01:54.746 --> 01:57.010
let's start the tape

01:57.716 --> 01:59.902
Hi Eric, it's your mother.

02:00.987 --> 02:03.861
I'm here with
Donna and Fez.

02:04.267 --> 02:05.491
Hi honey !

02:05.517 --> 02:08.012
Thank you for the
postcard with the monkeys.

02:09.006 --> 02:11.350
I'm still bananas
about you too !

02:17.086 --> 02:19.401
Okay, let's see,
where to start...

02:19.468 --> 02:24.392
well your father and I were furious when
we caught you boys in that smokey basement.

02:24.805 --> 02:30.002
The minute you left the airport we went down
there to do what the Fed's call 'a sweep'...

02:32.295 --> 02:36.980
How dare you boys smoke up my
house when you know how hard I work

02:37.018 --> 02:39.830
to keep it smelling
lemony-fresh !

02:40.437 --> 02:46.183
You morons just hung vacancy-signs on your
asses ! And my foot is looking for a room !

02:51.637 --> 02:53.072
- Here it is !
- Here it is !

02:55.275 --> 02:56.593
TWO bags ?

02:56.786 --> 02:58.812
I've never seen those
before in my life !

03:00.897 --> 03:03.320
Your son has a
real problem !

03:07.625 --> 03:12.422
Kitty, I want you to take this
garbage and flush it down the toilet !

03:13.405 --> 03:17.880
I am just glad that we caught you boys
before this became an every day thing !

03:20.308 --> 03:21.720
Is that all of it ?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.771
Yes sir, that's all of it.

03:23.806 --> 03:27.262
Now there is nothing left for
us to do but to smoke Candyland.

03:28.658 --> 03:31.090
I mean, I mean
play Canysmoke...

03:33.526 --> 03:36.323
I mean... Aiii no !

03:38.517 --> 03:42.602
And so I flushed it all down the
toilet and everyone learned a lesson...

03:44.465 --> 03:46.723
Why don't you tell Eric
what else happened ?

03:47.048 --> 03:49.303
- Oeh let me, let me !
- Give me that !

03:51.086 --> 03:52.200
I'll tell him...

03:54.585 --> 03:56.943
Kitty ! I found
another one !

03:57.555 --> 03:58.453
Kitty ?

04:02.857 --> 04:04.092
What the hell ?!

04:11.945 --> 04:14.490
What do you have to
say for yourself ?!

04:15.885 --> 04:17.901
I'm STARVING !

I still can't believe Red caught you
in the bathroom with the guys stash.

05:03.525 --> 05:06.813
Someone is getting a tye-dyed
apron for their birthday... !

05:07.895 --> 05:09.212
No, I just

05:09.446 --> 05:12.113
I wanted to see what
all the hubbub was about.

05:12.656 --> 05:16.762
I mean I was skeptical about
tupperware and that was lifechanging !

05:18.565 --> 05:19.880
Anyway Eric,

05:19.927 --> 05:24.502
I suffered the consequences, your
father gave me a very stern talking to.

05:26.425 --> 05:28.190
Kitty when we got married,

05:28.226 --> 05:32.502
we took a vow. To be together
through sickness and in health.

05:32.536 --> 05:37.480
But nobody said anything about what to
do if your wife turns into a dope fiend !

05:41.216 --> 05:46.322
You're a nurse for God's sake !
You know this stuff is bad news !

05:46.418 --> 05:48.982
Bad news isn't
the half of it !

05:49.748 --> 05:51.323
Here are the facts:

05:51.347 --> 05:54.832
when the smoke hits the
brain, the cells start dying.

05:55.086 --> 05:57.931
This process causes
impaired judgement

05:57.976 --> 06:01.173
and hallucinations and a
lot of other wonderful things

06:07.478 --> 06:09.463
Is it Eric going away ?

06:09.666 --> 06:11.921
Is that why you
used this stuff ?

06:12.267 --> 06:13.103
Kitty,

06:13.387 --> 06:17.412
if you were feeling blue, you
didn't have to turn to drugs !

06:17.468 --> 06:19.843
I would have made
you a Martini !

06:24.308 --> 06:26.243
What's so damn funny ?!

06:28.648 --> 06:30.493
Is it the big head thing ?

06:37.797 --> 06:39.751
I hardly felt a thing.

06:42.865 --> 06:45.800
You ate a whole box
of uncooked spaghetti.

06:51.677 --> 06:54.263
Anyway Eric,
the day you left,

06:54.305 --> 06:57.202
Steven went to
Chicago to see Jackie

06:57.238 --> 07:00.693
.. when he got there, he walked in on
Jackie and Kelso who were about to...

07:00.727 --> 07:02.020
Get busy.

07:04.317 --> 07:05.762
Have sex

07:07.498 --> 07:08.801
Doooooo
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit !

07:13.228 --> 07:15.970
Kelso told us the whole story
when he got back the next day.

07:17.266 --> 07:19.552
No, hardly anything
happened okay.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.832
Jackie asked me to stay
cause she was lonely.

07:21.855 --> 07:23.991
The next thing you
know, I'm naked.

07:24.567 --> 07:27.741
And then Hyde shows up
and kicks me out the door

07:27.775 --> 07:31.750
and so I had to drive all the way
back here in this dress that I found.

07:32.146 --> 07:35.710
All the truckers were flashing
their lights and honking their horns.

07:36.775 --> 07:38.363
It was pretty great.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.131
Man Hyde is gonna
kick your ass.

07:42.396 --> 07:45.560
I know. I gotta get out of here
before someone kicks the crap out of me

07:46.217 --> 07:49.123
YOU JERK !

07:49.157 --> 07:52.760
HEY hey ! Watch the face !

07:53.478 --> 07:55.040
That's the paycheck !

07:56.077 --> 07:57.142
Jackie,

07:57.447 --> 07:59.482
aren't you supposed
to be in Chicago ?!

07:59.645 --> 08:01.581
Well I'm here to
get Steven back.

08:01.836 --> 08:03.482
Uhh, where is he ?

08:03.688 --> 08:05.221
Oh he's not here.

08:05.278 --> 08:08.372
He took off after he caught
you two about to DOOOO IIIIIT !

08:10.518 --> 08:12.793
Oh my God, this is horrible.

08:13.075 --> 08:16.553
I quit my job, I
lost my boyfriend.

08:16.728 --> 08:18.280
My whole life is ruined.

08:18.325 --> 08:22.123
Jackie, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.550
I never meant to come
between you and Hyde.

08:24.856 --> 08:26.332
Let me ask you one question,

08:26.388 --> 08:28.313
are we back
together or not ?

08:28.915 --> 08:30.700
Oh you are just
as dumb as ever !

08:30.737 --> 08:34.203
Okay, you know you can insult me all
you want but just answer the question !

08:34.225 --> 08:35.030
NO !

08:35.085 --> 08:36.913
No you won't answer the
question ?! Why not ?

08:36.936 --> 08:38.472
Because we're not together !

08:38.498 --> 08:40.922
THAT'S the reason you
won't answer the question ?!

08:40.965 --> 08:41.770
NOOOOOO !

08:41.808 --> 08:44.063
THEN WHAT'S THE REASON ?

08:46.455 --> 08:49.721
.. and that went on for
about...half an hour.

08:51.397 --> 08:52.732
Oh hey Kitty.

08:52.758 --> 08:56.322
I need to borrow some butter or
oil. Pretty much anything greasy.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.342
Are you cooking ?

08:58.377 --> 08:59.780
Nope, tanning.

09:02.826 --> 09:04.241
Hey, what's up with
the tape recorder ?

09:04.285 --> 09:06.802
Oh, I'm making a tape
to send to Eric. Here,

09:06.846 --> 09:09.612
- say hi !
- Don't give him the microphone !

09:09.668 --> 09:12.433
What's new pussycat
Whooohohoooowww..

09:13.418 --> 09:15.192
What's new pussy..

09:15.955 --> 09:18.403
Ai Donna ! Boo ! Boo !

09:20.172 --> 09:22.578
Dad, just say
something normal.

09:22.608 --> 09:25.364
Normal doesn't put
asses in the seats Donna.

09:25.988 --> 09:27.448
For the last time,

09:27.478 --> 09:30.191
there are no seats
anywhere around here !

09:31.497 --> 09:35.193
Oh Red honey, here,
say something to Eric !

09:36.275 --> 09:37.561
I'd love to

09:40.826 --> 09:44.211
Son, I was out in the
garage the other day.

09:44.756 --> 09:47.750
I looked down and I saw
your old baseball mitt.

09:47.786 --> 09:50.403
And it made me think
what I always think.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.893
What a waste of money

09:59.968 --> 10:03.602
Actually Eric, you leaving
was very hard on your father.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.082
The next day he just
sat around, moping.

10:07.016 --> 10:08.473
I feel like

10:08.507 --> 10:09.561
dancing !

10:28.926 --> 10:33.233
By the way Eric, we gave some
of your toys to the church !

10:45.557 --> 10:46.830
Give up Eric ?

10:47.807 --> 10:51.880
That's a deck of cards
hitting a bottle of soy sauce.

10:53.228 --> 10:57.150
Eric, please come home. You
have no idea how much I miss you.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.523
I miss you too honey.

10:59.557 --> 11:02.631
I don't think I'll be
happy until I see you again.

11:02.905 --> 11:03.663
Hey.

11:03.978 --> 11:05.860
STEVEN'S HOME !

11:07.298 --> 11:10.823
Okay Miss Kitty, he
doesn't like to be hugged !

11:14.547 --> 11:16.562
Don't you ever
leave me again !

11:18.078 --> 11:20.463
I spilled my
soda...Hiiiiiii.

11:23.878 --> 11:25.342
I don't know
what to say man.

11:25.718 --> 11:26.913
What about "Ow" ?

11:27.195 --> 11:28.733
Why would I say ow ?

11:32.795 --> 11:34.072
I get it !

11:42.425 --> 11:43.360
Eric,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.671
Steven just hit Michael.

11:49.987 --> 11:54.581
And while I'm very disappointed
in Steven for hitting Michael,

11:54.605 --> 11:56.842
it was very exciting !

11:59.558 --> 12:00.862
Come on man, get up.

12:01.618 --> 12:04.063
Why ? So you can
deck me again ?

12:04.335 --> 12:06.173
Actually I'm fine now.

12:06.548 --> 12:09.190
Everything I wanted to say
was in that one punch. Come on

12:13.646 --> 12:15.551
It was a good one too.

12:18.515 --> 12:20.760
Peed myself a little
on the way down.

12:25.558 --> 12:26.973
I'm gonna go change

12:29.715 --> 12:31.551
Hyde, where have you been ?

12:31.596 --> 12:32.522
Uh

12:32.716 --> 12:36.190
I've been hanging out in Las Vegas
my man. And I've learned this:

12:36.355 --> 12:39.103
you don't wanna show up
late to a Don Rickles Show

12:39.145 --> 12:40.252
with puffy hair.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.900
Well, you could have let
us know where you were.

12:45.926 --> 12:48.200
I was worried sick about
you and I am very...

12:48.225 --> 12:49.440
I got you this

12:50.456 --> 12:54.392
A little tiny slotmachine !

12:56.495 --> 12:58.091
It is so cute

12:59.905 --> 13:01.393
Steven you're back !

13:01.435 --> 13:03.170
Look, we have to talk.

13:03.288 --> 13:05.740
About what ? How
you nailed Kelso ?

13:06.097 --> 13:08.730
No, about our relationship.

13:08.775 --> 13:11.070
Oh okay. I'll
start...You nailed Kelso !

13:11.095 --> 13:13.202
You never gave me a
chance to explain !

13:13.236 --> 13:15.092
BECAUSE YOU NAILED KELSO !

13:15.188 --> 13:18.903
Mrs. Forman, start taping ! Eric
loves it when he screams at her !

13:21.105 --> 13:23.400
Steven I never even
slept with Michael.

13:23.456 --> 13:28.742
Yeah right because Kelso is always showing
up at my hotelroom naked with a bucket of ice.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.672
You know this is
your fault too.

13:30.698 --> 13:33.031
Okay you two,
just stop yelling !

13:43.767 --> 13:44.840
Go ahead.

13:47.178 --> 13:48.561
No forget it.

13:49.626 --> 13:51.303
Well I guess that's that.

13:54.096 --> 13:56.080
Well that was horrible.

13:56.507 --> 13:57.842
I know.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.400
Where the hell is my
little tiny slotmachine...

14:07.927 --> 14:08.732
R ed

14:09.196 --> 14:13.190
can you please just do me a favour
and tell Eric you miss him a little ?

14:14.616 --> 14:17.010
Oh fine. Give me the thing

14:19.608 --> 14:20.572
Eric,

14:21.855 --> 14:25.191
this is a little hard for me
cause I'm not real emotional but

14:25.605 --> 14:27.441
I wanted to tell you that

14:27.955 --> 14:30.243
you GI Joe's were killed.

14:31.377 --> 14:34.401
In the great
Dumpster-war of 1979

14:39.768 --> 14:42.863
Well your meatloaf
was lost in the great

14:42.916 --> 14:47.313
"Make-your-own-dinner-war"
of 19-TODAY !

14:53.585 --> 14:54.730
Well Eric,

14:54.905 --> 14:56.580
now that I have a second,

14:58.096 --> 15:00.572
I should catch you up on
your new friend Charlie.

15:03.708 --> 15:04.673
Okay.

15:05.325 --> 15:06.533
Who brought the beer ?

15:06.556 --> 15:07.891
I thought you were
bringing the beer.

15:07.936 --> 15:08.681
No,

15:08.825 --> 15:10.600
you were bringing
beer, I was chips.

15:10.635 --> 15:12.190
YOU'RE bringing
beer, I was chips.

15:12.666 --> 15:14.343
Fine. Give me the chips.

15:14.386 --> 15:15.611
I forgot the chips.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.130
You guys

15:20.026 --> 15:22.031
How much do we
love this guy ?

15:22.367 --> 15:23.803
He's a prince !

15:23.846 --> 15:26.192
Charlie, it is so awesome
hanging out with you.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.312
Ah thanks guys, it feels so good to
finally belong to something you know.

15:29.347 --> 15:31.281
It's like the first day
of the rest of my life !

15:32.086 --> 15:33.181
THE BEER !

15:40.937 --> 15:43.702
That was a pretty
awkward landing...

15:44.468 --> 15:45.923
I hope he's okay.

15:46.575 --> 15:48.603
Of course he's okay.

15:48.666 --> 15:51.931
It's not like anyone ever died
falling off the watertower.

15:53.846 --> 15:58.670
And so they renamed it the Charlie
Richardson Memorial Watertower.

16:05.118 --> 16:08.741
Jackie, Hyde just needed to blow
off some steam, you guys aren't over.

16:11.415 --> 16:13.470
Well if you
won't talk to me,

16:13.505 --> 16:17.060
then maybe you'll
talk to Mr. Fluffycakes

16:22.078 --> 16:23.343
Jackie !

16:26.286 --> 16:30.821
My magical horn senses that you're
sad and you need someone to talk to !

16:40.566 --> 16:41.392
Great.

16:41.536 --> 16:43.451
Now he can't hear you

16:46.848 --> 16:47.713
Hey

16:47.867 --> 16:48.713
Jackie.

16:49.337 --> 16:51.302
Oh, what do you want ?

16:51.498 --> 16:52.412
Man,

16:52.975 --> 16:55.971
I feel really bad about
the way things turned out.

16:56.785 --> 16:59.693
You and Hyde should be
together okay. Go talk to him.

16:59.726 --> 17:01.801
Look there is no point okay.

17:02.716 --> 17:05.770
I'm starting to think Steven never
really wanted to be with me at all.

17:06.606 --> 17:09.621
This must be how ugly
people feel all the time.

17:12.195 --> 17:14.339
I wouldn't know
about the ugly thing.

17:15.396 --> 17:17.973
But I do know that he
does wanna be with you.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.951
Why else would he drive all the
way to Chicago to propose to you ?

17:23.407 --> 17:24.852
Wait, what ?!

17:25.406 --> 17:26.771
Oh my God !

17:26.806 --> 17:28.731
Steven was gonna propose ?!

17:28.905 --> 17:30.620
I have to find him !

17:33.177 --> 17:36.403
Tell you what, that's the last time I wanna
mess around with a girl with a boyfriend.

17:39.697 --> 17:41.791
Kelso, your hand
is on my butt.

17:43.976 --> 17:45.822
Come on he's in Africa !

17:48.877 --> 17:50.012
You know Red,

17:50.368 --> 17:54.781
it really upset me this afternoon when
you wouldn't say anything nice to Eric.

17:55.035 --> 17:59.761
Well I can see how that would surprise you, what
with nice things always bubbling out of my mouth.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.620
Well it would just mean a lot to
me to hear you say how you feel.

18:03.657 --> 18:05.371
Don't you even miss him ?

18:05.397 --> 18:07.051
Well let's say I did.

18:07.177 --> 18:09.932
I still wouldn't feel
comfortable saying it on tape.

18:09.985 --> 18:12.832
Well would it kill you just to
say it to me here in private ?

18:12.858 --> 18:15.062
Oh fine ! I miss him !

18:15.425 --> 18:17.440
Of course I miss him.

18:17.977 --> 18:19.441
He's my son...

18:20.945 --> 18:23.611
Why do you always
make me say things ?!

18:28.187 --> 18:28.951
Yeah

18:35.297 --> 18:37.251
I should be in the FBI.

18:42.328 --> 18:44.912
So anyway Forman, ramble on,

18:45.148 --> 18:46.813
keep on keeping on,

18:46.956 --> 18:48.682
most of all my friend,

18:48.788 --> 18:50.002
rock on.

18:53.385 --> 18:54.311
You know,

18:54.857 --> 18:58.110
I never used to understand
that hippie-jargon,

18:59.506 --> 19:01.470
but ever since my

19:01.635 --> 19:03.611
"bathroom-experiment",

19:05.705 --> 19:07.260
I'm cool man !

19:09.477 --> 19:12.472
Oeh, let me just give
you two some privacy

19:14.365 --> 19:15.203
Hey.

19:16.576 --> 19:17.351
Hey.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.931
Steven I am so sorry about
what happened in Chicago.

19:27.975 --> 19:30.702
I was alone and I
thought I lost you.

19:31.976 --> 19:34.571
Yeah well, I can see
why you thought that.

19:35.437 --> 19:38.412
Look why didn't you tell me
sooner you wanted to get married ?

19:39.497 --> 19:41.442
Because I wasn't
sure I wanted to.

19:42.876 --> 19:46.870
And now that I've thought about it, I'm
right, I'm not ready to be married yet.

19:48.206 --> 19:49.001
Yet ?

19:50.955 --> 19:52.170
Oh, okay.

19:53.278 --> 19:55.212
Well there you have it Eric,

19:55.257 --> 19:58.031
Steven's not ready
to get married yet.

20:04.748 --> 20:06.743
Hi I'm looking for...

20:07.308 --> 20:08.360
HYDE !

20:10.146 --> 20:11.482
Hey baby !

20:12.307 --> 20:13.862
Hey...Sam.

20:13.916 --> 20:15.930
Who the hell is that ?!

20:18.808 --> 20:21.050
This is Sam. She's a st...

20:21.895 --> 20:24.520
exotic dancer
I met in Vegas.

20:25.406 --> 20:27.983
I'm sorry, what
are you doing here ?

20:28.017 --> 20:29.461
You don't remember ?

20:29.526 --> 20:31.133
We got married.

20:32.916 --> 20:34.631
- OH MY GOD !
- WHAT ?

20:36.038 --> 20:39.502
One more thing Eric,
Steven married a stripper !

20:46.795 --> 20:49.683
Being up here makes me think
of my poor friend Billy.

20:51.028 --> 20:53.133
His name was Charlie
you cantaloup.

20:54.648 --> 20:57.733
Kelso you've fallen off
this thing like ten times.

20:57.797 --> 21:00.261
It's so scary to think you
could have...you know, like,

21:00.486 --> 21:02.392
met the same
fate as Charlie.

21:02.437 --> 21:03.201
Yeah.

21:03.518 --> 21:07.513
It's like we go through our lives like thinking
we're invincible right, but the truth is

21:07.535 --> 21:09.143
we're totally 'vincible

21:13.678 --> 21:16.301
THUD SCREW THAT
! I'M INVINCIBLE !

21:21.726 --> 21:23.912
Oh my God, what did I do...

21:24.018 --> 21:26.182
You married a Las
Vegas stripper.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.711
Congratulations.

21:29.077 --> 21:30.730
With Eric gone,

21:30.777 --> 21:32.443
you're the town dumbass !

21:33.625 --> 21:34.522
Steven,

21:34.626 --> 21:37.840
how could you get
married and not remember ?

21:37.865 --> 21:38.922
It's not like

21:39.276 --> 21:43.462
forgetting where you left your
keys or where you parked your car

21:43.525 --> 21:45.770
or your tenth anniversary...

21:46.606 --> 21:48.610
Kitty that was
thirteen years ago !

21:48.646 --> 21:49.731
Fifteen.

21:51.278 --> 21:52.860
Has it been that long ?

21:53.728 --> 21:55.642
I don't know what
happened, I mean,

21:55.686 --> 21:57.931
Samantha and I hung out
for three weeks, and then

21:57.968 --> 22:01.440
one night we got really drunk and I
remember waking up with a killer hangover,

22:01.466 --> 22:04.071
thinking I better get out of Vegas
before I'd do something stupid

22:05.796 --> 22:06.991
So close !

22:09.165 --> 22:11.443
Here are some
pictures of our wedding

22:12.985 --> 22:17.101
We found this beautiful little
chapel called "Weddings and Waffles".

22:19.686 --> 22:22.480
We got married by an
Elvis impersonator ?!

22:23.727 --> 22:26.262
Oeh and look at his name !

22:26.298 --> 22:27.772
Elvis Priestly.

22:29.105 --> 22:31.093
Isn't that clever ?

22:31.548 --> 22:33.941
Wow, that must have
been some wedding.

22:33.967 --> 22:37.400
It's not too often that you see
the bride jump out of her own cake.

22:39.627 --> 22:41.592
Oh man, it's starting
to come back to me.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.472
I remember seeing a
cross and an altar.

22:44.578 --> 22:46.822
But I thought I was having
that Excorcist-dream again.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.750
WHERE'S THE STRIPPER ?

22:50.807 --> 22:52.312
THERE SHE IS !

22:52.348 --> 22:54.862
THERE IS A STRIPPER
IN THE KITCHEN !

22:55.037 --> 22:57.392
AM I YELLING ?
I CAN'T HELP IT !

22:58.038 --> 23:01.422
OOOOOOH HYDE YOU MARRIED A
STRIPPER I LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH

23:03.607 --> 23:06.683
You must be Kelso.
I'm Samantha Hyde

23:06.716 --> 23:08.852
Oh my God, you
took my name ?!

23:09.895 --> 23:13.360
Oh Steven, you look like
you're about to throw up !

23:14.257 --> 23:15.231
Here,

23:15.487 --> 23:17.622
use Eric's 'whoopsie' basin.

23:18.535 --> 23:20.443
Aim for the Snoopy.

23:21.385 --> 23:23.932
I got the get out of here. I'm
gonna go to the record store.

23:23.975 --> 23:27.011
Well Hyde, you're
freakin' out man.

23:27.067 --> 23:30.381
You married a stripper !
You're living every guys dream !

23:31.088 --> 23:34.011
Well not my dream, my
dream is always the same,

23:34.047 --> 23:36.182
monkey gives me the finger

23:38.088 --> 23:40.143
and flaps his lips at me

23:40.788 --> 23:42.730
and takes off
with my clothes.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.703
Trust me, you don't
wanna live that dream.

23:58.717 --> 24:01.120
What's the store doing closed
in the middle of the day ?

24:01.375 --> 24:03.112
Maybe it's Rosh Hashanah.

24:13.318 --> 24:15.881
Hey dude, pull up a pillow.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.522
Leo,

24:18.916 --> 24:21.033
what the hell did you
do with my record store ?

24:21.268 --> 24:22.520
Record store ?

24:23.336 --> 24:27.513
You know now that you mention it, this
place would make an awesome record store.

24:34.555 --> 24:39.220
I left you in charge and you turned my store
into a hippy den for your stoner friends ?!

24:40.075 --> 24:41.930
That's not true man.

24:41.997 --> 24:44.022
I don't know any
of these people.

24:48.066 --> 24:49.801
Leo, I'm not in the
mood for this today.

24:49.835 --> 24:52.583
Just get these people out of
here alright. I'll be in my office

24:55.085 --> 24:57.510
Leo there is an
ORGY in my office !

24:58.768 --> 25:02.020
I can't the boys from the
girls it's hair everywhere !

25:09.378 --> 25:10.220
Man.

25:10.418 --> 25:12.880
This is no way to
spend Rosh Hashanah.

25:19.396 --> 25:21.172
I can't believe Hyde.

25:21.636 --> 25:24.130
I mean he completely
broke Jackie's heart.

25:24.215 --> 25:26.932
Who just goes and
marries a stripper ?

25:26.976 --> 25:28.292
What are you, dense ?

25:30.506 --> 25:32.582
Anybody who can, that who.

25:34.687 --> 25:36.853
Okay, get dressed.
We're going out.

25:37.008 --> 25:41.480
But it doesn't really matter what you wear,
because everyone is gonna be looking at me.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.450
But don't wear that.

25:45.157 --> 25:46.161
Wow Jackie.

25:46.187 --> 25:49.712
After everything you've been through
with Hyde, you come here and insult me ?!

25:50.096 --> 25:51.343
You're all better !

25:52.377 --> 25:54.522
Well I'm not gonna
sit around moping.

25:54.565 --> 25:57.232
I'm gonna do what every woman
does when they hit rock bottom.

25:57.267 --> 25:59.293
You're going to
have sex with me ?!

26:01.428 --> 26:02.290
No.

26:02.716 --> 26:04.953
I'm going to go out
and meet some boys,

26:04.985 --> 26:07.381
and crush their
hearts one by one.

26:07.426 --> 26:11.323
You know Donna, Eric is in Africa.
Must be close to hitting rock bottom...

26:12.708 --> 26:13.603
Not really.

26:14.747 --> 26:18.603
How long has a boy have to wait before
one of floosies hits rock bottom ?

26:27.016 --> 26:28.810
Oh. Samantha.

26:28.966 --> 26:31.520
You're painting your
toes in the kitchen.

26:32.918 --> 26:36.603
That's funny because I was just
making meatloaf in the bathroom.

26:38.358 --> 26:39.390
Sorry.

26:39.416 --> 26:42.312
Hyde told me how much
he likes painted toes.

26:42.586 --> 26:46.541
He told me some other things that he liked but
I said: Hey I'm a stripper not a contortionist.

26:47.377 --> 26:50.222
Well isn't that just more
then a mother wants to hear.

26:51.267 --> 26:52.913
Okay so,

26:53.148 --> 26:54.392
I'm curious.

26:54.597 --> 26:56.310
What is your act like ?

26:56.357 --> 26:57.542
Do you sing ?

26:57.577 --> 26:58.823
No I just dance.

26:58.848 --> 27:02.703
Oh. Well when I was younger,
I took tap. Do you do tap ?

27:02.966 --> 27:06.050
No funny that you should
mention it, I strip to taps !

27:08.126 --> 27:09.090
You mean

27:09.696 --> 27:12.491
the song they play
when an army man dies ?!

27:12.955 --> 27:13.750
Yeah.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.853
It's my tribute to
our armed forces.

27:17.485 --> 27:19.933
I wave the American flag

27:19.975 --> 27:22.981
and then for the big
finish, I give a salute

27:23.048 --> 27:24.753
and the I smack my fanny

27:29.028 --> 27:30.230
Sorry I...

27:30.276 --> 27:32.062
No I'm sorry.

27:32.107 --> 27:34.262
This thing has a
mind of it's own

27:36.247 --> 27:37.142
Red,

27:37.375 --> 27:41.353
I'm not sure how I feel about
having a stripper stay in our home.

27:41.698 --> 27:43.463
It's, what's the word,

27:43.498 --> 27:44.973
an abomination !

27:46.705 --> 27:49.690
I don't think Steven even knew what
he was doing when he married her.

27:49.725 --> 27:53.160
It sounds like he was as schnockered
as you were on St. Patricks Day.

27:53.537 --> 27:57.121
Okay well that green punch
sneaks right up on you !

27:58.415 --> 28:01.693
I think Steven has
made a huge mistake.

28:01.788 --> 28:03.292
But what are we gonna do ?

28:03.386 --> 28:04.541
Kick Sam out ?

28:04.575 --> 28:06.701
Oh we will do no such thing.

28:06.747 --> 28:07.770
You will !

28:09.386 --> 28:10.711
Oh fine.

28:10.935 --> 28:12.643
But the next time
you hit a deer,

28:12.685 --> 28:15.611
you're the one putting it out of
it's misery with it's tyre iron !

28:21.207 --> 28:22.380
Well well,

28:22.428 --> 28:27.392
another day in the life of Point Place police
officer. I just confiscated a whole box of lighters,

28:27.477 --> 28:29.820
paraphernalia and
illegal substances...

28:29.857 --> 28:31.472
ice work officer.

28:31.537 --> 28:33.851
Now we're hooked
up for two months.

28:35.698 --> 28:36.540
So...

28:37.667 --> 28:39.482
what do we do now...

28:39.798 --> 28:41.923
Man I think I
have to fire Leo.

28:42.286 --> 28:44.280
He almost put me
out of business.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.102
Just wish there was
a good way to do it...

28:50.078 --> 28:52.201
This is definitely gooder.

28:53.607 --> 28:54.452
Gooder ?

28:55.657 --> 28:56.820
Yeah that's a word.

28:59.147 --> 29:00.063
Leo,

29:00.937 --> 29:03.993
I left you in charge of the
store and you let me down man.

29:04.306 --> 29:06.521
So I'm sorry to have to say

29:08.386 --> 29:09.890
you're fired man !

29:12.065 --> 29:15.233
I think the word you're
looking for is 'fried' man...

29:16.296 --> 29:17.553
And I am.

29:19.306 --> 29:21.490
No no man I mean
you're fired.

29:22.668 --> 29:25.070
That's even funnier man !

29:25.405 --> 29:27.401
And I totally deserve it.

29:28.576 --> 29:30.821
Yeah and you're
under arrest too !

29:31.655 --> 29:32.580
What ?!

29:33.465 --> 29:36.780
I'm just kidding. These
handcuffs don't even work, look...

29:40.688 --> 29:43.253
wait, these are the
ones that DO work...

29:45.456 --> 29:48.413
Hey, I saw this Help
Wanted sign outside.

29:48.686 --> 29:49.961
You still looking ?

29:50.986 --> 29:51.810
Errrrr,

29:53.006 --> 29:55.552
Leo were you trying
to hire somebody ?

29:56.248 --> 30:00.322
You know yesterday I was having a
hard time opening up a jar of pickles

30:00.375 --> 30:02.373
so I put the Help
Wanted sign up.

30:03.157 --> 30:05.902
Too late man, I found
something else to eat.

30:10.246 --> 30:13.862
Why do they make the lid so
tight ? It's just pickles !

30:15.096 --> 30:17.001
So you're not hiring ?

30:17.297 --> 30:19.980
That's a bummer.
Cause I gotta say,

30:20.208 --> 30:22.422
if this is your idea
of a staff meeting,

30:22.626 --> 30:24.343
I'd work my butt off !

30:25.427 --> 30:28.041
What the hell man, I'm in
a giving mood right now.

30:28.078 --> 30:31.100
You can have the job and do all
the work that Leo wasn't doing.

30:31.255 --> 30:34.261
And Leo I can't fire you
man. You're too awesome.

30:34.357 --> 30:35.740
New guy, you're hired.

30:35.777 --> 30:38.190
Leo you're not fired,
jobs for everyone.

30:39.827 --> 30:41.963
Well that was hard
but it had to be done.

30:48.258 --> 30:50.493
Wow Jackie, that
is quite an outfit.

30:50.885 --> 30:52.493
Does it come with a pimp ?

30:53.648 --> 30:56.193
Donna, this is my
man-catcher dress !

30:56.235 --> 30:58.613
It is scientifically
designed to make men want me,

30:58.656 --> 31:01.831
while at the same time knowing
they could never really have me.

31:02.495 --> 31:04.423
Oh everyone loves a tease...

31:06.676 --> 31:08.493
Oh he is cute and smiling !

31:08.898 --> 31:11.133
I'm gonna go and make
him wish he was dead !

31:14.498 --> 31:16.352
Can I ask you a question ?

31:16.616 --> 31:18.551
Yes, I'm available.

31:19.638 --> 31:21.941
But not to you ! HA ! BURN !

31:21.996 --> 31:24.960
Oh my God that was so much
fun, I wanna do another one !

31:26.078 --> 31:28.860
Actually I just wanted to know
your hot blond friend's name...

31:28.906 --> 31:30.900
Oh I don't have a
hot blond friend.

31:31.455 --> 31:33.130
I'm just here
with Fez and Donna.

31:33.945 --> 31:34.992
Donna ? Thanks !

31:35.037 --> 31:36.801
Wait, wait, what,
you like Donna ?!

31:36.825 --> 31:38.820
She reads books for fun !

31:40.416 --> 31:41.721
Hi,

31:41.775 --> 31:42.911
I'm Mark.

31:43.245 --> 31:44.160
Wow,

31:44.386 --> 31:46.893
you have one of the prettiest
smiles I've ever seen.

31:46.937 --> 31:47.681
Oh

31:47.716 --> 31:49.261
thank you !

31:53.096 --> 31:55.891
Well the secret is to
brush with baking soda !

31:57.867 --> 31:59.870
Actually I was
talking to Donna.

31:59.907 --> 32:02.182
Wow, you are just gorgeous.

32:02.207 --> 32:03.933
Really ?

32:04.136 --> 32:07.111
Yeah you know Donna
means 'lady' in Italian.

32:07.377 --> 32:09.760
And Belladonna means
'fine lady', and you,

32:09.906 --> 32:12.220
you are definitely
one fine lady.

32:12.695 --> 32:14.843
What's Italian
for 'keep going' ?

32:16.207 --> 32:17.640
Wanna play a little pool ?

32:18.076 --> 32:21.441
Oh I'm sorry I can't.
I have a boyfriend.

32:22.467 --> 32:23.702
He's in Africa.

32:26.978 --> 32:29.943
Well he is just missing out
on how beautiful you look.

32:30.558 --> 32:32.733
La mia fiora bella.

32:34.185 --> 32:35.370
Italian !

32:40.157 --> 32:41.532
Can you believe that ?!

32:41.565 --> 32:43.820
Ah don't worry.
You still got me.

32:44.778 --> 32:46.143
Hi, I'm Kim.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.770
Dance with me.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.450
So long lame-o !

33:01.618 --> 33:02.610
Hey Samantha,

33:02.648 --> 33:04.502
you should have seen
your dopey husband today.

33:04.546 --> 33:06.252
He was supposed to fire Leo,

33:06.278 --> 33:09.073
but then he wussed out
and hired a new guy too.

33:09.915 --> 33:14.110
It's like the time I went to break up with this
chick and I ended up doing it with her AND her mom.

33:14.888 --> 33:17.640
I understand why you
couldn't fire anyone.

33:17.676 --> 33:19.931
On the outside you're
rough and cynical,

33:19.967 --> 33:24.061
but underneath is all you're just a sweet
curly-haired boy who likes to be tickled.

33:25.268 --> 33:26.202
Really ?!

33:28.146 --> 33:29.791
Kelso, if you
try to tickle me,

33:29.817 --> 33:33.622
I swear to God I rip off your arm and
tickle the bloody hole with your own hand.

33:35.636 --> 33:39.472
You'll figure out what to do
honey, you have great instincts.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.291
You have a great butt too,
but that's a whole other thing

33:44.038 --> 33:45.481
She is awesome.

33:45.587 --> 33:48.733
Hey Sam, let me ask you a
question about being a stripper.

33:48.768 --> 33:50.211
Can I see your boobs ?

33:55.505 --> 33:56.791
Oh Samantha.

33:57.267 --> 33:58.390
You're here.

33:59.617 --> 34:01.701
Did Red talk to
you by any chance ?

34:01.747 --> 34:04.103
Mr. Forman ? No. Why ?

34:04.136 --> 34:06.021
Oh. Well. Uhhm.

34:06.246 --> 34:08.652
"What's that ? Be
right there Eric !"

34:12.165 --> 34:15.900
Then my psychiatrist said
the reason I always want sex

34:15.947 --> 34:20.522
is because I never got apporoval from my
parents so I'm trying to find it somewhere else.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.791
Do you think he's right ?

34:23.556 --> 34:25.540
Dear God I hope so !

34:28.014 --> 34:31.101
Who does that guy think he
is rejecting me like that ?!

34:31.148 --> 34:34.373
I am the hottest girl
here ! Right Fez ?

34:38.955 --> 34:40.223
Hey you !

34:40.876 --> 34:41.931
Mark is it ?

34:42.286 --> 34:43.193
Yeah.

34:43.317 --> 34:45.072
I don't know
where you're from.

34:45.155 --> 34:49.021
But I'll have you know, I
am the catch of Point Place.

34:49.746 --> 34:52.271
That's true. That's how
she signed my yearbook.

34:52.898 --> 34:54.690
Ah come back here !

34:55.135 --> 34:57.943
Nobody ignores
Jerky Backhart !

34:58.706 --> 35:00.843
I am adorable !

35:00.887 --> 35:03.992
I am engaging and
I'm DAMN likeable.

35:05.546 --> 35:08.092
And if you're too
stupid to see that,

35:08.125 --> 35:10.061
then I feel sorry for you !

35:10.248 --> 35:13.302
Cause if anyone should be
the center of attention here,

35:13.706 --> 35:14.873
it's me.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.432
Jackie !

35:17.927 --> 35:19.282
Get off me !

35:23.667 --> 35:25.521
What the hell is
a "boobs out" ?

35:34.358 --> 35:35.931
Okay, your turn !

35:41.968 --> 35:43.912
Ah Samantha, there
you are, good.

35:43.948 --> 35:46.823
Hi Mr. Forman. I
was just unpacking.

35:47.207 --> 35:48.523
Aren't these cute ?

35:48.545 --> 35:49.181
Oh !

35:51.396 --> 35:53.581
I mean you can't
tell like this.

35:53.608 --> 35:54.911
You have to picture
them like this

35:57.127 --> 36:00.493
Plus they hold dollar bills
better then anything I own.

36:01.545 --> 36:03.971
I'm going upstairs
to find you a wallet !

36:09.917 --> 36:11.941
Hey Randy, come here.
I want to talk to you.

36:11.985 --> 36:13.921
Yeah sure, but
check this out first

36:13.985 --> 36:17.563
See these guys over there ? They
think Leo is an Almond brother.

36:18.796 --> 36:21.023
- Why would they think that ?
- I told them !

36:21.726 --> 36:22.531
Wow,

36:22.846 --> 36:24.800
Leo is an Almond brother ?!

36:25.837 --> 36:26.941
Yeah man.

36:27.135 --> 36:29.261
We were overstocked with
Almond Brothers albums.

36:29.295 --> 36:32.910
So I figured meeting one of the guys of
the band would put people in a buying mood.

36:33.308 --> 36:34.951
And it totally worked !

36:36.308 --> 36:37.662
And Leo's up for this ?

36:37.695 --> 36:39.743
Oh he has no idea
what is going on.

36:40.386 --> 36:43.982
I mean...at all.
He's really out of it.

36:45.226 --> 36:46.853
You know now that
you mention it,

36:46.957 --> 36:51.301
if we give him a hat and some sunglasses we
could probably use him to move some ZZ Top !

36:51.598 --> 36:52.620
Yeah.

36:52.745 --> 36:55.833
Your friend here might be
pretty enough to pass of as Cher.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.051
Yeah.

36:59.026 --> 37:01.993
That's not a bad
idea Andy Gibb !

37:05.698 --> 37:07.320
So what did you want
to talk to me about ?

37:07.365 --> 37:08.170
Oh.

37:09.237 --> 37:12.760
I guess I just wanted to congratulate you
on your new job here at the record store.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.932
I name you senior vice-president
in charge of scams.

37:15.966 --> 37:17.672
Alright man !

37:18.248 --> 37:20.442
Man, I can't fire Leo.

37:20.487 --> 37:21.922
He's like a father to me.

37:22.355 --> 37:23.963
Well like a friend.

37:24.988 --> 37:27.053
Well he's like a guy
who always has lighter.

37:28.206 --> 37:29.052
Whoho.

37:29.158 --> 37:34.120
So if you're not gonna fire Randy, and
you're not gonna fire Leo, I got a question.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.151
Can I see your wife boobs ?

37:38.826 --> 37:40.941
Hey guys, guess what.

37:41.337 --> 37:43.933
One of the Almond
Brothers is here !

37:49.477 --> 37:51.733
This new guy
Randy is awesome !

37:51.767 --> 37:55.591
Today he was looking over the records, and
he figured out it be easier to find things

37:55.616 --> 37:57.970
if we just
alphabetized them.

37:59.187 --> 38:02.180
Hey, do you know what
you were doing just now ?

38:02.938 --> 38:04.250
No, what ?

38:04.496 --> 38:06.873
Telling your wife
about your day.

38:07.205 --> 38:08.421
Pretty cool huh ?

38:08.696 --> 38:09.872
Didn't suck.

38:12.646 --> 38:15.650
Oh good. You're both here.

38:16.117 --> 38:18.801
We want to talk to you
about your marriage.

38:19.605 --> 38:22.260
Steven, I've come to
think of you as a son,

38:22.287 --> 38:25.881
and so I want to give you
some honest, hartfelt advise.

38:26.127 --> 38:28.333
Get your head
out of your ass.

38:30.138 --> 38:32.302
You two barely
know eachother.

38:32.345 --> 38:36.230
Not to mention that I saw a TV
movie where someone like you moved in

38:36.277 --> 38:38.090
and killed the whole family.

38:41.908 --> 38:43.671
Steven honey,

38:43.696 --> 38:47.040
if this isn't what you
want, you should say so now.

38:48.437 --> 38:50.282
Yeah, you should.

38:51.288 --> 38:55.900
Hyde, if you don't want me here, I'll
pack up my things and leave tonight.

38:58.897 --> 39:00.582
No man, it's cool.

39:02.927 --> 39:04.622
Okay then.

39:06.858 --> 39:08.450
Oh she's staying.

39:09.888 --> 39:10.741
Well

39:11.198 --> 39:15.022
Well I guess I'll go set an extra place
at the table for stripper...supper !

39:19.995 --> 39:23.172
You're never gonna believe
this ! I drove here this way.

39:28.635 --> 39:30.721
Jackie, will you
please come out ?

39:30.787 --> 39:32.970
I don't think even
anyone saw you.

39:38.138 --> 39:39.163
OH MY GOD !

39:42.728 --> 39:45.650
I'm sorry about my friend,
she's a little prudish.

39:46.597 --> 39:49.141
She's not as free with her
body as I hope you will be.

39:51.727 --> 39:53.111
Ready to go baby ?

39:53.408 --> 39:56.351
Hey buddy, the only guy
she is leaving with is me !

39:57.157 --> 40:00.232
Unless you just wanna do it in the
bathroom, then we can leave separately.

40:01.907 --> 40:04.691
Fez, there is something
I need to tell you.

40:05.035 --> 40:06.402
Mark and I are married.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.491
What ?

40:10.698 --> 40:14.420
Yeah we come here every weekend and
watch eachother hit on strangers.

40:14.716 --> 40:17.782
It makes for some ultra hot
action when we get back home !

40:18.638 --> 40:21.443
Wait, yeah Eric and
I tried that once.

40:21.477 --> 40:25.222
I got three phone numbers and he
got the highscore on Space Invaders.

40:27.135 --> 40:29.203
Wait, you do this
every weekend ?!

40:29.245 --> 40:32.760
You shower some poor loser with affection
and then toss him aside when you're done ?!

40:33.158 --> 40:34.132
Yeah.

40:36.195 --> 40:37.500
See you next weekend...

40:43.588 --> 40:45.521
I gotta say, Sam
is pretty cool.

40:45.548 --> 40:46.370
Yeah ?

40:46.705 --> 40:48.960
Yeah yesterday for
no reason at all,

40:48.998 --> 40:53.201
she grabbed a beer out of the
fridge and just like gave it to me.

40:55.716 --> 40:57.200
I mean what is
that all about ?

40:58.457 --> 41:01.572
Maybe that is what husbands
and wives do for eachother ?

41:01.717 --> 41:03.813
Craziest damn
thing I ever saw.

41:05.086 --> 41:08.492
Uhm Steven ? I just wanna let
you know that we're through.

41:08.535 --> 41:13.370
If you're gonna go off and marry someone you
don't even know, then we can't be together anymore

41:16.465 --> 41:20.451
Okay. Well I guess you always
have Kelso to fall back on.

41:21.435 --> 41:22.622
Or Fez.

41:23.618 --> 41:25.251
Hey what ? Did
I hear my name ?

41:26.116 --> 41:27.740
Are Jackie and I
going to do it ?

41:29.035 --> 41:30.971
Can somebody tell me
what is going on ?!

41:31.788 --> 41:34.353
Steven I have been
so stupid for so long.

41:34.398 --> 41:37.740
I tried to force Michael to marry
me, I tried to force you to marry me.

41:37.787 --> 41:41.752
And last night I threw myself at some
unavailable creep I didn't even like.

41:42.198 --> 41:44.591
Well, now you've
hit a new low.

41:45.665 --> 41:49.202
Throwing yourself at
some guy on Rosh Hashanah.

41:52.946 --> 41:56.103
So you know what ? I'm done
making an ass of myself for you.

41:56.148 --> 41:58.010
Or any other guys.

41:58.115 --> 41:59.122
In fact,

41:59.355 --> 42:01.181
I'm done with
guys completely.

42:01.738 --> 42:02.972
Hear that Hyde ?

42:04.586 --> 42:08.801
We screwed her up so bad she's switching
to chicks ! How awesome are we !

42:12.035 --> 42:14.030
So I was thinking
about you all week,

42:14.056 --> 42:16.941
how cute and flustered you
looked when I kissed you.

42:17.256 --> 42:18.963
I really liked that.

42:18.997 --> 42:20.812
Yess..me too...

42:24.296 --> 42:27.673
You know what, this is
too creepy. Even for me.

42:28.575 --> 42:30.643
Enjoy your sick
lives together

42:35.465 --> 42:37.943
You know, sorry about that, I
don't even know what that was about.

42:40.377 --> 42:41.532
Where were we ?

42:42.305 --> 42:48.319
