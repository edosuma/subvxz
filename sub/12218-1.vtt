03:52.084 --> 03:55.501
"Paradise Island, Thailand."

04:54.251 --> 04:56.042
I won't let you suffer all this for nothing.

05:00.917 --> 05:05.334
I want Ken Shek to suffer ten thousand-fold
what you have suffered.

05:19.334 --> 05:22.667
"Macau"

05:33.667 --> 05:34.876
Kiss her.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.542
Hello Martin, long time no see.

05:43.459 --> 05:44.459
Enjoy yourself.

05:44.459 --> 05:45.709
Enjoy, enjoy.

05:45.709 --> 05:46.584
What's your name?

05:46.667 --> 05:48.001
I am Yan.

05:48.001 --> 05:49.917
I'm David, would you like
to watch a movie with me?

05:50.001 --> 05:52.251
I'd love to, but have to ask my Dad first.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.584
You need permission for just that?

05:53.584 --> 05:56.876
Hey Bosses, how can you not wait for me
for the photo?

05:58.126 --> 05:59.501
What is it you're wearing, Robot Stupid?

05:59.501 --> 06:01.209
I spent a lot of time picking this out.

06:05.001 --> 06:05.542
Robot Stupid,

06:05.542 --> 06:06.376
-where's Dad?
-Have you asked Master to come to take photo?

06:06.376 --> 06:07.751
He's in the bride's room.

06:07.751 --> 06:08.834
I'll go and get him.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.084
But you have to say I I'm hot first!

06:10.084 --> 06:13.459
Take it off, that's a woman's outfit. Go!

06:13.501 --> 06:17.459
I won't be crying if I'm not heart-broken.

06:18.001 --> 06:20.834
You think raising a daughter is easy?

06:21.126 --> 06:24.042
I had to get up almost
8 to 9 times every night.

06:24.042 --> 06:26.501
Feeding her and changing her diapers.

06:26.917 --> 06:30.126
When did I ever get to sleep well?

06:32.751 --> 06:36.251
And once she says she wants
to get married, then off she goes.

06:37.084 --> 06:40.084
And I'm left alone in the house.

06:41.501 --> 06:45.001
I don't know what to do. I'm devastated.

06:45.709 --> 06:49.626
Boss, my condolences.

06:49.626 --> 06:54.667
Robot Stupid, from now on,
it's just you and me against the world.

06:54.667 --> 06:55.751
Yes, Sir.

06:55.751 --> 06:58.959
Remember, you have to strive
to be a good person.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.042
I will.

07:00.042 --> 07:02.209
Why tears?

07:02.542 --> 07:05.209
Your daughter is only marrying
your protÃ©gÃ© today.

07:05.209 --> 07:07.042
Please stop, please stop.

07:07.042 --> 07:08.001
Don't say it anymore.

07:08.001 --> 07:09.667
Don't be like that,

07:09.667 --> 07:12.792
go out there and take a picture
with your daughter.

07:14.209 --> 07:17.209
What's wrong with your voice? It's very hoarse.

07:17.959 --> 07:21.209
Ko Chun took me to Las Vegas for training.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.751
So for 3 whole months,
I haven't had any Chinese soup.

07:23.751 --> 07:26.834
Stuck in the desert every day,
eating nothing but French fries.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.292
That's how my gums got swollen up like this.

07:30.209 --> 07:32.292
Did you learn any fascinating skills?

07:32.292 --> 07:36.084
No, just 3 months of fascinating hypnosis.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.417
- Boss, don't be like that.
-I am so doomed.

07:40.417 --> 07:41.626
I don't want to live anymore.

07:41.626 --> 07:43.542
Boss, relax.

07:43.542 --> 07:46.542
Don't be like that. It's a big day today.

07:46.542 --> 07:47.667
Go out there and take some pictures
with your daughter.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.417
Don't try to talk me into it.
I don't want to go anywhere.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.334
Master, what's the matter?

07:51.584 --> 07:52.959
What's wrong, Dad?

07:53.042 --> 07:54.542
Ghost!

07:56.167 --> 07:57.376
- What's wrong?
-Don't come close to me.

07:58.209 --> 08:00.501
The doctor said he has psychological barrier.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.292
He is suffering from

08:03.292 --> 08:06.167
"denial-of-daughter-to-be-married-
all-is-lost-anxiety disorder".

08:06.667 --> 08:09.001
And I'm suffering from

08:09.001 --> 08:11.167
"to-be-married-no-more-freedom phobia".

08:11.167 --> 08:12.626
What did you say?

08:14.292 --> 08:16.542
All the guests have arrived. What do we do now?

08:17.376 --> 08:19.792
Looks like it's time I used my

08:19.792 --> 08:22.792
newly acquired fascinating skills.

08:23.001 --> 08:23.876
What skills?

08:23.876 --> 08:25.709
In your case, you will have to
discuss with her.

08:30.042 --> 08:33.333
Ken, now concentrate on this watch.

08:33.626 --> 08:34.708
Yes.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.958
Are you feeling very tired?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.417
Yes.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.751
What do you see?

08:41.251 --> 08:44.417
I see something white down your crotch.

08:45.417 --> 08:47.292
Oops, I'm sorry.

08:47.292 --> 08:49.251
Let's start over again. Concentrate...

08:49.251 --> 08:50.167
Yes.

08:50.251 --> 08:52.167
Don't stare at the white stuff anymore.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.209
What do you see now?

08:55.209 --> 08:57.501
Do you see your daughter getting married?

08:57.501 --> 09:01.459
Yes. She wants Vincent,
and she doesn't want me anymore.

09:01.459 --> 09:04.042
That is incorrect.

09:04.042 --> 09:05.584
Vincent is not marrying Rainbow today.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.626
Who is he marrying then?

09:08.126 --> 09:11.626
Your cousin - Marbled Pork.

09:11.626 --> 09:13.126
Babe.

09:13.126 --> 09:14.751
Marbled Pork?

09:23.292 --> 09:25.167
Vincent, I'm so sorry for you.

09:26.126 --> 09:27.084
Sorry for me?

09:32.084 --> 09:33.584
- Hope you enjoy the party.
-Master.

09:33.584 --> 09:35.334
I hope you like the food. Enjoy the party!

09:35.334 --> 09:37.501
I helped to raise the kid too. Look...

09:39.292 --> 09:40.667
See how pretty your daughter is.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.501
I'm relieved. She finally gets to be married...
at last she's married.

09:43.501 --> 09:45.251
I hope you like the food.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.417
- Mark, did you see that?
-Enjoy the party!

09:46.667 --> 09:48.501
What's up with him? He's a bit overexcited.

09:48.501 --> 09:49.959
I hope you like the food. Enjoy the party!

09:49.959 --> 09:51.167
At least he's back to normal.

09:51.167 --> 09:52.792
A while ago, he was a mess back
there inside the room.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.542
What did you do to him?

09:55.334 --> 09:56.167
I can feel it.

09:56.167 --> 09:57.126
How do you feel?

09:57.126 --> 09:58.667
I feel re-energized.

09:59.626 --> 10:00.876
Try me.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.126
What's wrong? Are you alright?

10:03.126 --> 10:04.209
Never better.

10:04.542 --> 10:08.251
Hope you enjoy the party.

10:14.751 --> 10:15.917
Michael.

10:17.209 --> 10:18.417
Where is Mr. Ko, your master?

10:18.501 --> 10:20.417
Mr. Ko is still in Las Vegas.

10:20.751 --> 10:24.167
Michael has pharyngitis.
Doc said he shouldn't talk too much.

10:24.167 --> 10:25.334
You two are...

10:25.751 --> 10:27.292
Im am Chime, and she is Ebony.

10:27.292 --> 10:28.834
We are Michael's new assistants.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.334
That's why I don't recognise you.

10:30.917 --> 10:31.751
Where is Ken?

10:31.751 --> 10:33.709
Master Ken is over there,
standing by for the ceremony.

10:36.376 --> 10:37.501
Enjoy the party.

10:37.501 --> 10:38.626
Have some drinks.

10:38.751 --> 10:39.876
Enjoy.

11:15.209 --> 11:17.459
Daddy, what are you laughing about?

11:17.792 --> 11:20.126
I'm so glad finally somebody
wants to marry you.

11:20.126 --> 11:21.292
Vincent.

11:21.751 --> 11:23.542
- What's up, Master?
-Thank you for having her.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.417
Please take good care of my cousin.

11:27.376 --> 11:28.542
Your cousin?

11:33.876 --> 11:35.959
Gosh, this has gone a bit too far,
he's going crazy.

11:35.959 --> 11:40.751
We welcome everyone here today

11:40.751 --> 11:44.917
to witness the matrimony of
Vincent and Rainbow.

11:45.126 --> 11:50.376
Their decision to marry
has not been entered into lightly

11:50.376 --> 11:56.959
and today they publicly declare
their devotion to each other.

11:57.792 --> 12:01.084
They commit to accept each other
as lifelong companion.

12:01.084 --> 12:02.001
Michael.

12:02.584 --> 12:03.376
Michael.

12:07.334 --> 12:10.417
Hello Mark, this is Michael.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.959
I'm in Singapore.

12:13.626 --> 12:15.667
I got news that someone is disguised as me.

12:15.959 --> 12:18.834
It is a robot, a robotic bomb.

12:19.126 --> 12:22.251
He's a robot bomb, everybody run!

12:23.751 --> 12:25.042
- Hey Mr. Chan?
-Boss!

12:25.417 --> 12:26.751
Run.

12:27.001 --> 12:28.376
Bomb.

12:29.834 --> 12:30.667
Robot Stupid.

13:02.584 --> 13:04.917
- Get an ambulance.
-Where is Ken?

13:05.542 --> 13:06.417
That was fun.

13:08.584 --> 13:10.626
- Did you hear me? Call an ambulance.
-Be careful.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.209
- Ken.
-I hope you enjoyed the party.

13:49.376 --> 13:53.417
Boss, I'm glad you are okay.
I was so worried about you.

14:00.792 --> 14:01.959
Ken.

14:28.376 --> 14:29.167
Who is she?

14:29.167 --> 14:31.751
The new director of the Interpol, Miss Ice.

14:31.751 --> 14:33.001
You just got here in time.

14:33.209 --> 14:35.042
This whole floor has been taken
by my family and friends.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.167
My son-in-law and my daughter are in ICU.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.917
You'd better find out who the criminal
is before you leave.

14:38.917 --> 14:41.167
The Interpol does not need
your coaching to work.

14:41.376 --> 14:42.334
Mr. Ken, Mr. Mark.

14:42.334 --> 14:43.709
Is it necessary to be so polite?

14:44.126 --> 14:45.084
You have become suspects of

14:45.084 --> 14:46.459
US$15 billion dollar theft from D.O.A.

14:46.626 --> 14:47.751
You are now under arrest.

14:48.584 --> 14:50.251
Are you reciting the lines
from last year's script?

14:50.251 --> 14:51.292
Shut up.

14:51.876 --> 14:53.251
You are indeed a topnotch hacker.

14:53.584 --> 14:55.667
The 15 billion dollars was in our custody
until the night before last.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.042
It just disappeared from
our account for no reason.

14:57.209 --> 14:58.751
Fortunately, our advanced tracker system
led us to you.

14:58.917 --> 15:02.251
We know you've split the money into
two 7.5 billion dollars and stashed them

15:02.251 --> 15:04.126
away into various secret bank accounts
in Bermuda and the Virgin Islands.

15:04.126 --> 15:06.876
Wait, let me make a call to Bro Long Wu.

15:06.876 --> 15:08.792
He is now one of the Senior Officials
of the Interpol.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.792
Don't waste time talking to them.

15:10.792 --> 15:13.251
They just love framing people.
You can handcuff me first.

15:13.251 --> 15:14.209
Arrest them.

15:26.501 --> 15:27.751
Hey, you're trapped.

15:28.459 --> 15:30.001
How did that happen?

15:35.542 --> 15:36.709
- Calm down.
-I'll kick your butt.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.626
People have been saying
what a tough fighter you are...

15:38.626 --> 15:40.042
I've seen better.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.959
"Hong Kong - High Security Prison."

16:04.667 --> 16:06.042
Buddha's rays rising.

16:06.042 --> 16:07.209
Buddha stirring up the mountains and seas.

16:07.209 --> 16:08.667
Buddha's power over Canaan.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.292
Buddha descends on earth on Buddha Day.

16:10.292 --> 16:11.626
Buddha's rays rising.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.834
Buddha and I are united.

16:14.126 --> 16:15.417
Buddha's power is limitless.

16:15.417 --> 16:18.209
Now I'm going to open up
the Ren and Du Accupoints for you.

16:30.376 --> 16:31.584
How was that?

16:32.709 --> 16:34.126
Do you want to throw up blood?

16:34.126 --> 16:35.584
Accupoint Hwei Yin.

16:39.584 --> 16:41.459
Alright, if that's not powerful enough,
I'll strengthen the power.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.834
The tenth stroke: All Buddhas facing the sky.

16:49.292 --> 16:50.792
- Hey you.
-Yes.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.126
Why did you brush my tooth?

16:52.126 --> 16:53.917
Where am I?

16:53.917 --> 16:55.376
You have been sleeping for 10 days in here.

16:55.459 --> 16:57.167
Why did I sleep here?

16:57.167 --> 16:59.501
On your daughter's wedding day,
I hypnotized you.

16:59.501 --> 17:01.334
Then there was an explosion,
causing concussion to your brain.

17:01.459 --> 17:02.917
Then you got hit by stun guns and passed out,

17:02.917 --> 17:04.166
now your head is messed up.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.001
- Who am I?
-You are Ken Shek.

17:06.001 --> 17:08.001
- And who are you?
-I'm Mark.

17:08.001 --> 17:09.084
Who is Mark?

17:10.541 --> 17:12.291
This is not working.
Let me unhypnotize you first.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.751
Are you okay? You tired?

17:16.916 --> 17:18.291
No. I'm okay.

17:18.291 --> 17:19.291
What do you see now?

17:19.291 --> 17:21.291
I see you. That's not fast enough.

17:21.334 --> 17:22.376
Not fast enough? I'll speed up.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.209
- Need help?
-No need. You just sit and watch.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.791
- Let me help you.
-No, just sit down.

17:25.791 --> 17:26.876
- I can help you.
-I don't need help.

17:26.876 --> 17:28.126
- Go higher!
-I don't need your help.

17:28.126 --> 17:29.251
- Faster!
-I don't need help.

17:29.251 --> 17:30.917
- A little higher still!
-Don't do that.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.001
How did this happen?

17:41.209 --> 17:42.376
Hello, who's this?

17:42.751 --> 17:43.459
Open the gate.

17:45.042 --> 17:46.959
Activity time for second floor cells.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.709
Hey bro, you alright?

18:01.751 --> 18:04.292
I am. Just sticking my head out
to check if it's safe out here.

18:05.042 --> 18:05.876
Is it?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.709
Very safe. You go ahead,
I'll be right after you.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.001
See you later.

18:16.084 --> 18:18.042
- Big Brother B.
-Hey Ken,

18:18.042 --> 18:19.459
what brought you back in here?

18:19.459 --> 18:22.709
Nothing serious, the guy said I was
messing with some lady cop at the hospital.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.417
- She tased me, I passed out, and here I am.
-ls that him?

18:24.834 --> 18:26.334
Why are you still here?

18:26.334 --> 18:27.667
I can't leave. I've got life.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.251
- You're such a nutcase!
-That's true.

18:30.667 --> 18:31.792
Are you new here?

18:31.792 --> 18:32.542
Who are you?

18:32.542 --> 18:35.001
King Black of Jiufen. Ever heard of me?

18:35.292 --> 18:37.376
You are Black Dog-poo!

18:50.084 --> 18:52.084
You Assbole, no...Asshole!

18:52.667 --> 18:53.876
Come on, Blackie. He's a friend.

18:53.876 --> 18:55.834
We are all buddies, don't start a fight.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.626
Ken, come here, let's play a game.

18:57.626 --> 18:59.667
Come over here, don't get upset.
We are all under the same roof.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.709
You really think it's a good idea
to put them in here.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.751
This is safer than any safe house.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.084
Do they really live up to their name?

19:05.084 --> 19:06.542
This is Mr. Long's instruction.

19:06.751 --> 19:08.001
His men will be here soon.

19:08.001 --> 19:09.667
When they do, our mission will be done.

19:10.459 --> 19:12.167
What a crowd.

19:15.167 --> 19:15.792
What are we playing?

19:15.792 --> 19:17.792
We're in a prison.
African Poker will be a good fit.

19:18.084 --> 19:20.126
They have poker in Africa?

19:20.876 --> 19:22.334
Do Hong Kong people have Hong Kong foot?

19:22.501 --> 19:24.126
And Jiufen should have dog-poo?

19:25.417 --> 19:26.417
Listen.

19:26.417 --> 19:27.417
Get one card each.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.876
Stick it on your forehead,
see who has the biggest card.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.876
You can all see my card,
but I cannot see my own.

19:30.876 --> 19:33.751
Of course I understand that.
You think I'm stupid?

19:34.001 --> 19:34.792
What do we use for money?

19:34.792 --> 19:37.167
Cigarettes. In prison, cigarette is money.

19:37.167 --> 19:38.417
I don't have cigarettes, bro.

19:38.417 --> 19:39.792
I just found 2 packs.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.542
2 packs? That's not enough.

19:41.542 --> 19:44.001
You are the Magic Hand, come on.

19:44.001 --> 19:45.917
- Who's the Magic Hand?
-You are.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.042
- You can make a lot out of this.
-Me?

19:47.042 --> 19:48.126
- I can do that?
-Yes.

19:48.126 --> 19:48.834
Excuse me.

19:59.792 --> 20:01.667
Go go go, more...more!

20:09.876 --> 20:11.667
- Is this enough, bro?
-Yes. It's enough.

20:11.667 --> 20:12.792
- This is impressive, handsome.
-Enough.

20:13.584 --> 20:16.084
Show me all your cigarettes.

20:17.792 --> 20:19.251
- Hurry up.
-Give out the cards.

20:20.917 --> 20:23.167
Okay. 1,2, 3!

20:31.376 --> 20:34.126
If you have to cheat, can it be at least
a little more discreet?

20:34.584 --> 20:36.251
You are the guest. Your call.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.501
3 packs then.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.417
Are you in?

20:43.542 --> 20:44.084
Nope.

20:45.042 --> 20:45.751
How about you?

20:48.959 --> 20:49.626
I'm out too.

20:51.501 --> 20:52.209
- How about you?
-They're out.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.084
I'm backing you up.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.626
- That's great.
-But I'm out.

20:54.626 --> 20:56.751
Great. I'm all in.

20:56.751 --> 20:57.542
Good.

20:58.209 --> 21:00.459
Looks like you have a very good card.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.667
You're out...and you're out.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.251
And you're out too.

21:04.251 --> 21:06.001
Mine shouldn't be too bad either.

21:06.001 --> 21:08.126
I'll play. All in.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.001
So which card is in play?

21:21.167 --> 21:22.459
Of course the one on your forehead.

21:22.751 --> 21:24.042
His card is not small, isn't it?

21:24.209 --> 21:26.334
If we are playing the Big Two,
then his card is very big.

21:30.251 --> 21:31.959
Even my "7" is good enough to beat yours.

21:35.042 --> 21:35.834
What's the matter?

21:35.834 --> 21:37.334
Did you all just came back
from your father's funeral?

21:37.334 --> 21:39.126
No cigarettes for a year, no big deal.

21:39.709 --> 21:41.126
Assholes.

21:41.126 --> 21:43.084
We don't even smoke.
Give them back the cigarettes.

21:43.626 --> 21:45.042
- Give them back?
-Give them back.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.292
Ok, you can have them back.

21:46.584 --> 21:47.626
Thank you Bro Ken.

21:52.584 --> 21:53.792
Since everyone's here,

21:53.792 --> 21:55.626
let's sing a song to celebrate.
You'll make a name out of it.

21:55.709 --> 21:57.209
Sing? Again?

21:57.209 --> 21:58.209
It's called continuity.

21:58.292 --> 21:59.292
Don't make me.

21:59.459 --> 22:00.292
Ok. Then don't sing.

22:00.292 --> 22:01.584
That's not very nice.

22:03.459 --> 22:08.459
"Living in this world,
true friendship don't come easy."

22:08.667 --> 22:13.584
"Not many friendships can last for long."

22:13.834 --> 22:19.251
"We hold each others' hands as we are
about to go separate ways."

22:19.251 --> 22:23.959
"But our friendship
will always live in our hearts."

22:24.792 --> 22:32.209
"We may split up today,
but some day tomorrow, we will meet again."

22:32.501 --> 22:38.751
"Even if we cannot see each other,
we will remain friends forever."

22:38.751 --> 22:39.959
What's all that noise?

22:48.042 --> 22:49.834
There goes the party.

22:53.084 --> 22:55.376
How can you not invite me to join the party?

23:01.292 --> 23:05.834
"There may be miles and miles of mountain
range between us."

23:06.501 --> 23:11.334
"But deep down inside,
we know we don't need to be together"

23:11.334 --> 23:15.834
"Still our friendship will remain unchanged."

23:16.167 --> 23:21.251
"Living in this world,
true friendship don't come easy."

23:21.376 --> 23:26.376
"Not many friendship can last for long."

23:26.501 --> 23:31.542
"We hold each others' hands as we are
about to go separate ways."

23:31.917 --> 23:37.167
"But our friendship
will always live in our hearts."

23:37.417 --> 23:43.709
"We may split up today,
but some day tomorrow, we will meet again."

23:45.209 --> 23:47.626
"Even if we cannot see each other,"

23:47.626 --> 23:52.959
"we will remain friends forever."

23:52.959 --> 23:57.251
"There may be miles and miles of mountain
range between us."

23:58.126 --> 24:02.834
"But deep down inside,
we know we don't need to be together."

24:02.959 --> 24:07.501
"Still our friendship will remain unchanged."

24:07.792 --> 24:14.376
"Still our friendship will remain unchanged."

24:21.209 --> 24:21.792
Watch out.

25:08.417 --> 25:10.209
Ken Shek, show your face.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.792
Or I will kill everyone in here.

25:12.001 --> 25:13.584
He's looking for you.

25:13.667 --> 25:15.084
He's looking for you.

25:15.626 --> 25:16.626
Ken Shek is you.

25:16.626 --> 25:19.709
Asshole, I'm King Black from Jiufen.

25:19.876 --> 25:21.126
King Black?

25:21.751 --> 25:23.834
Why don't we all claim to be Ken Shek.

25:23.834 --> 25:25.501
They can't kill us all, can they?

25:25.501 --> 25:27.334
That's right.

25:27.334 --> 25:29.917
On the count of three,
we all shout "I am Ken Shek".

25:30.167 --> 25:31.209
Good.

25:31.292 --> 25:32.667
1...2...3

25:33.542 --> 25:35.167
I am Ken Shek.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.126
Kill him.

25:41.417 --> 25:42.334
Search .

26:52.126 --> 26:53.042
What's the score?

26:53.167 --> 26:53.959
98

26:54.167 --> 26:54.834
What about mine?

26:55.667 --> 26:56.792
101

26:57.126 --> 26:59.626
Hey Mr. Chan, have you come
to attend the wedding?

27:00.001 --> 27:01.417
My cousin is already married.

27:01.417 --> 27:02.626
Thank you for coming.

27:02.626 --> 27:08.584
I hope you like the food. Enjoy the party.

27:08.584 --> 27:10.959
He is demented.

27:12.209 --> 27:13.834
Bro, who are these two?

27:13.917 --> 27:15.542
This is Long Wu's son - Long Wu Jr.

27:17.001 --> 27:20.084
Nice, look - young and muscular.

27:20.417 --> 27:22.709
And you must be his brother Long Wu Most-Jr.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.792
Another handsome man.

27:23.792 --> 27:24.876
Why is your chest so soft?

27:26.459 --> 27:27.959
Now what?

27:28.292 --> 27:29.834
She is Master Ko's cousin.

27:29.917 --> 27:31.709
Kitty - my Aunt-aunt.

27:32.626 --> 27:33.626
A woman?

27:36.501 --> 27:37.417
She doesn't have an adam's apple.

27:38.334 --> 27:40.542
What kind of nutcase are you? How am I a man?

27:41.251 --> 27:42.584
Oh I'm sorry.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.084
Bomb!

27:50.709 --> 27:52.917
Bomb? Where is it?

27:58.334 --> 28:00.292
Why is this happening to me?

28:00.834 --> 28:03.042
There are things in this world
that cannot be explained.

28:03.042 --> 28:05.709
Stop pretending you are unconscious,
everybody has left.

28:06.959 --> 28:08.084
Time to go.

28:09.167 --> 28:12.584
"Michael's residence, Singapore."

28:30.584 --> 28:34.459
The supreme sword of the kingdom
- the Dragon Saber.

28:41.209 --> 28:42.792
- Thank you bro.
-What's with him?

28:43.501 --> 28:44.542
I'm not sure.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.417
He's been in Singapore for 7 days and nights.

28:46.417 --> 28:47.459
Yet he is still unconscious.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.209
His butt is still smoking.

28:50.084 --> 28:51.584
I have to take revenge.

28:51.751 --> 28:53.209
Looks like he is dreaming.

28:53.667 --> 28:54.751
I have to take revenge.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.126
I am the Master of the Ming Sect, Zhang Wu-ji.

28:57.251 --> 28:59.292
Remember these people

28:59.292 --> 29:01.459
You have to avenge
your dad's death in the future.

29:01.459 --> 29:02.584
I have to take revenge.

29:03.251 --> 29:04.626
- Where am I?
-My home.

29:05.459 --> 29:07.751
Thanks for taking me in, hero. You are...

29:07.751 --> 29:09.334
- People call me Gambling Robinhood...
-Wait.

29:09.376 --> 29:11.292
You must be the Condor Hero Yang Guo.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.209
I am Zhang Wu-ji.

29:13.292 --> 29:14.417
Bro Ken, please...

29:14.417 --> 29:16.417
Call me Zhang Wu-ji, and you are?

29:17.501 --> 29:18.501
The Invincible of the East.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.876
Mr Invincible, long time no see.

29:21.209 --> 29:22.126
Bro Wu is here.

29:22.126 --> 29:25.209
Aunt-aunt, he said he is Zhang Wu-ji.

29:25.209 --> 29:27.626
You call her Aunt-aunt,
so she must be Dragon-girl.

29:28.292 --> 29:29.834
All the heros are gathered here today.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.959
I must go downstairs to meet everyone.

29:38.251 --> 29:41.334
Hi everyone, he is the Master of the
Ming Sect - Zhang Wu-ji.

29:41.626 --> 29:42.626
And this one is...

29:42.876 --> 29:43.667
I'm Mother Ruthless.

29:44.542 --> 29:45.876
- This is Zhou Zhi-ruo.
-How are you?

29:45.876 --> 29:47.959
My protÃ©gÃ©s - A, B, C and D.

29:49.584 --> 29:53.251
This gentleman has so much charisma,
your name is?

29:56.917 --> 29:58.876
I'm your Grand-master, Zhang San-feng.

29:59.751 --> 30:01.626
Wu-ji, you have grown a lot.

30:01.917 --> 30:04.417
Grand-master, I haven't seen you for so long.

30:04.417 --> 30:05.834
I miss you so much.

30:05.834 --> 30:07.626
- Wu-ji.
-Yes.

30:08.292 --> 30:10.917
Take this Revival Pill, you will get better.

30:11.167 --> 30:12.167
What are they doing?

30:12.167 --> 30:13.042
How do you feel?

30:14.834 --> 30:15.751
Can I have another one?

30:16.001 --> 30:16.959
Yes.

30:20.709 --> 30:22.042
Can I borrow your birdie?

30:22.834 --> 30:23.917
What do you want it for?

30:28.459 --> 30:29.876
What kind of bird is this?

30:30.251 --> 30:31.376
Big Bird.

30:31.376 --> 30:32.584
Big Bird?

30:32.917 --> 30:34.126
How big is it?

30:34.292 --> 30:36.792
You go upstairs first. I will show you later.

30:37.001 --> 30:37.959
Wait,

30:38.334 --> 30:39.334
I haven't taken my revenge yet.

30:39.417 --> 30:40.792
Can anyone tell me

30:40.792 --> 30:42.501
where the Dragon Saber
and the Heavenly Sword are?

30:42.876 --> 30:43.667
Here.

30:46.042 --> 30:46.959
Thank you Grand-master.

30:47.167 --> 30:49.251
Heavenly Sword.

30:49.334 --> 30:50.709
Kill. Kill. Kill.

30:50.709 --> 30:52.167
Dragon Saber.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.126
Chop. Chop. Chop.

30:55.126 --> 30:56.751
I feel pity for you.

31:01.834 --> 31:03.001
I have read about this before.

31:03.376 --> 31:05.834
If a person has been hypnotised in a wrong way.

31:06.084 --> 31:07.667
He will suffer from early Psychosis.

31:07.917 --> 31:11.417
And become a 10 year old child, just like that.

31:12.042 --> 31:13.084
Oh my goodness.

31:15.501 --> 31:18.126
Mr. Long, Ken Shek should be
admitted to an asylum.

31:19.626 --> 31:20.876
Let's observe him for 2 more days.

31:22.084 --> 31:23.876
Why is he being hunted?

31:24.167 --> 31:26.834
We are investigating an illegal arms
dealing organization.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.834
The master mind behind it is a man called J.C.

31:29.001 --> 31:30.251
He has multiple identities.

31:30.251 --> 31:32.459
He calls himself Casino Tycoon.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.042
In fact he's a terrorist engages in arms

31:34.042 --> 31:35.626
trading with different countries.

31:35.876 --> 31:38.126
The robot that showed up
at Ken's daughter's wedding

31:38.126 --> 31:40.084
is a product of his organization.

31:40.167 --> 31:41.292
If they really looked the same as me,

31:41.292 --> 31:42.834
I should get 1 or 2 to guard my house.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.251
You know, I have 3 girlfriends and 5...

31:47.042 --> 31:50.334
Are you going out? Where to? Did I say yes?

31:51.209 --> 31:52.334
I'm sorry.

31:53.292 --> 31:55.542
Don't even think having 3 girlfriends
is something worth bragging about.

31:55.959 --> 31:58.709
Every one of them may have 3 boyfriends.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.251
You really think I won't hit you.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.292
He's just a male chauvinist who have
lived with his own ego all his life.

32:02.292 --> 32:03.792
What the heck does he know about women.

32:03.959 --> 32:06.292
If you can ask me one thing about women
that I don't know, I'd say you win.

32:06.584 --> 32:08.751
Are you familiar with

32:08.751 --> 32:11.209
"Anterior Pituitary Basophil
Inteotropic Hormone abnormality"?

32:11.209 --> 32:12.834
What kind of disease will it bring about?

32:13.626 --> 32:15.001
If you can repeat what you just said,
I'll consider you win.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.001
Not one out of a hundred guys

32:18.001 --> 32:19.792
-can answer that question.
-That's right.

32:19.792 --> 32:21.584
If you are diagnosed with

32:21.584 --> 32:23.251
Anterior Pituitary Basophil
Inteotropic Hormone abnormality...

32:23.251 --> 32:24.834
it will cause abnormality in your ovulation.

32:27.459 --> 32:28.917
What are you looking at?
You think you understand what it is?

32:29.292 --> 32:31.417
- Anterior Pituitary Basophil Inteotropic...
-Okay Okay!

32:31.709 --> 32:32.501
What is in that box?

32:32.584 --> 32:34.792
It's a delivery for Bro Ken, it's Robot Stupid.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.834
Bro Mark, tea or coffee?

32:42.917 --> 32:46.084
I don't need him in my house, Robot Skinny!

32:46.292 --> 32:48.001
Yes, Sir.

32:49.751 --> 32:51.959
Look how sexy she's dressed.

32:57.834 --> 33:01.792
Hi everyone, tea or coffee?

33:04.459 --> 33:07.667
Let me handle the chores.

33:08.709 --> 33:11.167
Miss Skinny, how do you do?

33:11.167 --> 33:12.126
How do you do?

33:12.334 --> 33:13.251
How do you do?

33:13.251 --> 33:14.334
Your name is?

33:14.792 --> 33:16.751
My name is Stupido.

33:16.751 --> 33:20.084
Stupido, you look so cool.

33:21.001 --> 33:23.542
Oh Stupido, you are having a nose-bleed.

33:24.042 --> 33:26.542
Oh it's been a little hot lately,
it's internal heat.

33:26.542 --> 33:29.917
Bro Wu, what is the cause of this
enmity between JC and Ken?

33:30.251 --> 33:31.376
It seems like he wants him dead,

33:31.376 --> 33:32.459
but at the same time he wants him to live.

33:32.459 --> 33:35.417
He called Master and I to go save him
in the last minute.

33:35.501 --> 33:38.126
And yet, back in the prison,
he wanted to kill him.

33:38.126 --> 33:39.709
Bro Wu, do you know the reason?

33:47.542 --> 33:48.501
No.

33:51.542 --> 33:53.292
Humans are so strange.

33:53.292 --> 33:57.959
Sweetheart, I am just 2 years older than you...

33:59.334 --> 34:01.376
What time do you get charged at night?

34:01.376 --> 34:04.001
Shall we do it together?

34:04.001 --> 34:07.584
You are getting my heart beating so fast,
this is embarrassing.

34:07.584 --> 34:11.667
Do you often play "Battling the Landlord"
on Tuyoo App?

34:11.667 --> 34:14.126
Yes, I do. When I am charging up...

34:14.126 --> 34:15.667
I play "Battling the Landlord"
at the same time.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.458
That's great. Your nickname is...

34:35.376 --> 34:37.251
This is my new lab on the island.

34:37.501 --> 34:39.208
It's well equipped with
the latest technology. Look...

34:39.208 --> 34:40.626
If we pursue with our work,

34:40.958 --> 34:44.833
in the future, human won't ever need
to die anymore.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.583
Am I great?

34:47.083 --> 34:48.626
Will you marry me?

34:49.876 --> 34:52.083
Marry me, I will give you everything.

34:52.083 --> 34:53.417
Listen to me.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.958
Is there somebody else?

35:03.876 --> 35:08.126
We broke up and got back together 3 times.
He means a lot to me.

35:09.292 --> 35:12.626
For the time being, I still cannot forget him.

35:14.584 --> 35:16.001
I don't mind that.

35:16.001 --> 35:18.084
I will wait for you. Okay? I'll wait.

35:18.084 --> 35:20.126
I will wait for you.

35:24.376 --> 35:26.251
Give me some time.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.751
Let me settle my business first.

35:30.251 --> 35:32.042
I will give you an answer by then.

35:33.584 --> 35:34.376
Okay.

35:34.876 --> 35:38.084
These two can control the weather,
they are powerful.

35:38.084 --> 35:39.626
And this one, once I press this,

35:39.626 --> 35:40.917
it will launch to the sky.

35:48.959 --> 35:50.542
I have to check your handbag.

35:57.084 --> 35:58.709
No photos

36:10.334 --> 36:11.167
Mr. J.C.

36:41.376 --> 36:44.709
If you want to kill anyone in my territory,
please inform me first.

36:46.376 --> 36:49.626
You are Molly's favourite assistant.
I will not treat you bad.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.751
You can work for me from now on.
I will rename you Kammy.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.001
Thank you, Mr. J.C.

36:53.001 --> 36:55.084
I have tracked down Ken Shek.

36:55.084 --> 36:58.376
He is in Singapore,
in the custody of Michael Chan.

37:04.001 --> 37:05.459
You unworthy loser,

37:05.459 --> 37:09.167
how can you bully an unarmed child.

37:09.167 --> 37:10.417
Let me show you the power of...

37:10.417 --> 37:11.542
There's water in his brain.

37:11.542 --> 37:12.834
...my Dragon Saber and Heavenly Sword.

37:18.417 --> 37:19.417
Sounds like somebody is up there.

37:19.417 --> 37:22.417
If not for Ken Shek, I would be laying
in the sun right now.

37:23.251 --> 37:24.917
You are only interested in picking up girls.

37:24.917 --> 37:27.751
Aunt-aunt, all I meant was just sunbathing.

37:27.751 --> 37:29.501
If there are only men at the pool,
will you still go?

37:29.501 --> 37:31.542
There are only men in this house,
and I'm still here!

37:31.667 --> 37:35.917
Michael, how can you talk
in this manner to a senior.

37:36.084 --> 37:38.626
Aunt-aunt, it's just a joke.

37:38.751 --> 37:39.667
Let's go.

37:39.834 --> 37:41.001
Bro Yang Guo.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.292
How can you talk like that to your Aunt-aunt?

37:43.501 --> 37:45.209
So now it's your turn to talk to me like this.

37:45.209 --> 37:46.751
If not for you,

37:46.751 --> 37:49.167
why would I end up like this?

37:49.167 --> 37:50.376
- Bro Yang Guo.
-What?

37:50.376 --> 37:51.876
I wish you could show a little respect for me.

37:52.834 --> 37:55.376
If not for you,

37:55.376 --> 37:58.126
why would I end up like this?

38:00.167 --> 38:01.751
There is nothing I hate more than

38:01.751 --> 38:03.376
being poked in the head.

38:03.459 --> 38:05.251
You'd better stop now or I will show you...

38:12.334 --> 38:13.167
That's enough.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.376
It really hurts.

38:20.834 --> 38:23.042
You just can't be nice to people like him.

38:23.751 --> 38:24.584
Look...

38:25.417 --> 38:26.584
How dare you poked my head!

38:28.501 --> 38:30.167
...behind you...

38:56.876 --> 39:01.126
How dare you poked my head!

39:12.876 --> 39:14.334
Which finger did you use just now?

39:14.751 --> 39:17.959
Show me that finger, I'll chop it off.

39:18.376 --> 39:20.084
I'll chop it off.

39:33.917 --> 39:34.917
Hi everyone, sorry for intruding.

39:34.917 --> 39:35.917
I am an ammo expert from

39:35.917 --> 39:38.459
the Interpol sent by Mr. Long Wu.

39:38.751 --> 39:39.834
What?

39:39.834 --> 39:42.792
I am Yu. My first name is Only.

39:42.792 --> 39:44.542
You can call me Only Yu.

39:44.542 --> 39:48.626
Only you...is that right?

39:49.042 --> 39:50.959
So you are the ammo expert
from the Interpol.

39:50.959 --> 39:53.459
In the presence of so many big heroes,

39:53.459 --> 39:56.626
I am just an inconspicuous
and humble little hero.

39:56.667 --> 39:59.001
So what is that?

39:59.292 --> 40:00.959
That's one of my inventions.

40:00.959 --> 40:04.417
It's used to subdue violence-proned suspects.

40:04.417 --> 40:08.501
It's nick-named "no-escape-from-
the-buddha's-grip"

40:08.709 --> 40:09.917
Impressive, eh?

40:10.917 --> 40:12.501
- I need un peu de calme.
-Okay.

40:12.501 --> 40:13.417
Anything powerful than this?

40:13.417 --> 40:14.084
Yes.

40:18.334 --> 40:21.917
This is a very important invention
in the ammo field in 2016.

40:21.917 --> 40:25.417
Its name is "No-mercy-utterly-devastating-...

40:25.417 --> 40:29.251
...nowhere-to-hide-gut-and-bone-
shatterer-killing-machine"

40:30.084 --> 40:31.251
Let me see.

40:32.626 --> 40:33.334
How powerful is it?

40:33.334 --> 40:36.209
Knock it on your head, you'll definitely
need to call an ambulance.

40:36.459 --> 40:37.667
What calibre bullets does it use?

40:37.667 --> 40:38.626
It does not require bullets.

40:39.792 --> 40:40.626
Can you still call it a gun?

40:40.626 --> 40:42.084
Sometimes it's a gun.

40:42.292 --> 40:43.209
How do you use it?

40:43.209 --> 40:46.292
Imagine this powerful gun
in the hands of a macho man.

40:46.751 --> 40:49.001
The bad guys will surely
be scared out of their minds.

40:49.292 --> 40:52.126
But don't forget the kids will be
scared to tears too. No worries.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.459
Take out this cone,

40:54.459 --> 40:57.209
then open up this lid, turn the knob here...

40:58.959 --> 41:02.334
Voila, an icecream is ready to comfort the kid.

41:02.417 --> 41:05.292
It's a combination of the devil and the angel.

41:05.584 --> 41:06.459
Impressive, eh?

41:06.542 --> 41:09.001
Shall we just strangle him now?

41:09.001 --> 41:09.792
I'm in.

41:09.792 --> 41:11.042
I'm in too.

41:13.167 --> 41:14.459
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:14.459 --> 41:16.417
It has a finger-print identification function.

41:16.417 --> 41:18.084
If you are not the owner,

41:18.084 --> 41:20.501
it will send out shock waves.

41:20.584 --> 41:21.917
I'm so sorry.

41:22.251 --> 41:24.001
Do you have anything that
doesn't give out shock waves?

41:24.001 --> 41:25.001
Yes.

41:25.001 --> 41:29.251
These are Ultrasonic Aerojet Glider Shoes.

41:29.417 --> 41:32.001
And also...

41:32.167 --> 41:32.876
What are those?

41:32.876 --> 41:36.042
Fuel tanks. But they weigh 10 kilograms each.

41:36.042 --> 41:37.292
They are too heavy to fly with the shoes.

41:37.542 --> 41:39.376
- What if you don't use the fuel tanks?
-Then the shoes can't fly.

41:39.376 --> 41:41.001
- Why?
-They need power to fly!

41:43.167 --> 41:44.001
I need un peu de calme.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.376
Don't go yet.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.334
- I want to show you another thing.
-Wait.

41:47.334 --> 41:51.126
These are real shoes.
Look, they are really soft inside.

41:51.126 --> 41:52.626
And there are hidden heels,

41:52.876 --> 41:54.126
so you'll look taller while wearing them.

41:54.126 --> 41:55.626
Bro Long Wu.

41:57.167 --> 41:59.834
First there was Ken Shek,
and now there's Only Yu.

41:59.834 --> 42:00.834
We can't manage them.

42:00.834 --> 42:03.167
Can we get rid of Only Yu?

42:03.376 --> 42:04.751
Wait.

42:06.876 --> 42:08.626
You cannot get rid of Only Yu.

42:09.084 --> 42:10.417
Does he have powerful connections?

42:10.417 --> 42:11.584
He is my brother-in-law.

42:12.042 --> 42:13.459
Well, then I take back what I just said.

42:13.459 --> 42:14.501
It's so corrupt.

42:15.501 --> 42:17.501
It is the cutting edge technology.

42:17.501 --> 42:19.834
My Hero, what about this chic coat

42:19.834 --> 42:21.626
you are wearing, how is it powered?

42:21.626 --> 42:23.001
You have good taste.

42:23.001 --> 42:24.501
- It looks cool.
-It is powered by

42:24.501 --> 42:27.459
this super micropower chip.

42:29.376 --> 42:30.376
Very high-tech.

42:31.001 --> 42:32.751
What if we insert this chip into those shoes?

42:33.626 --> 42:35.667
Your proposal is very creative.

42:35.667 --> 42:37.667
It never crossed my mind. Let's give it a try.

42:37.667 --> 42:39.626
Sure. Let's try it.

42:40.501 --> 42:41.542
How's that?

42:42.542 --> 42:43.876
Why are they vibrating?

42:43.876 --> 42:46.376
That's right, I can feel the vibration too.

42:52.084 --> 42:52.834
Eat this.

42:54.751 --> 42:56.626
I am flying.

42:56.626 --> 42:58.667
Flying.

43:02.876 --> 43:04.709
I'm flying.

43:10.167 --> 43:12.209
I'll see you around, my Hero.

43:14.626 --> 43:16.459
Who indeed is Un-peu-de-calme?

43:16.667 --> 43:19.001
That's right, who's Un-peu-de-calme?

43:19.001 --> 43:19.792
Is she pretty?

43:25.376 --> 43:28.209
I said I NEEDED A BIT OF SILENCE.

43:35.042 --> 43:35.959
Look.

43:37.084 --> 43:39.292
A good fighter and a good cook, all-in-one.

43:39.876 --> 43:41.292
Interested?

43:42.709 --> 43:43.751
But she is more into you.

43:44.334 --> 43:46.417
- I'm married.
-Really?

43:46.417 --> 43:48.709
Yes, I even have a daughter.

43:50.542 --> 43:51.584
But I do have a wife.

43:51.709 --> 43:53.084
Your wife doesn't want you.

43:53.084 --> 43:54.667
She is devoting all her time
on children education.

43:54.667 --> 43:56.292
Things might get better soon.

43:56.667 --> 43:58.334
So you are not interested?

43:59.334 --> 44:02.792
Are you interested in transforming this
into a 3 of diamond?

44:04.751 --> 44:05.792
Look.

44:15.251 --> 44:17.001
I hate gambling.

44:17.001 --> 44:19.667
You go to hell. Go get a life.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.126
When will you do something useful?

44:22.459 --> 44:24.167
I really hate gambling.

44:24.167 --> 44:25.667
I know now.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.542
Miss Purple?

44:32.959 --> 44:35.959
You have mistaken, Mr Mark. I am Kammy.

44:36.834 --> 44:39.417
I'm sorry, I opened your white wine.

44:39.417 --> 44:41.584
You didn't come all the way here
to drink white wine, did you?

44:42.917 --> 44:43.959
Nice to meet you.

44:44.292 --> 44:46.376
Let me do it. How do you do?

44:46.376 --> 44:48.667
I am Mr. J.C.'s assistant.

44:49.042 --> 44:49.751
She's fine.

44:49.751 --> 44:52.376
Whatever it is,
I am not acquainted with Mr. J.C.

44:52.376 --> 44:53.459
So what do you come here for?

44:53.459 --> 44:55.417
I think I had better let

44:55.417 --> 44:56.417
Mr J.C. speak for himself.

44:58.376 --> 44:59.292
That way.

45:13.917 --> 45:16.459
Hi everyone, I'm J.C.

45:17.709 --> 45:18.792
J.C. Enterprise's.

45:19.001 --> 45:21.459
I know Ken Shek is here.

45:21.459 --> 45:23.001
We have some private business
to settle between us.

45:23.001 --> 45:24.126
Can you hand him over to me?

45:24.209 --> 45:26.209
Ken Shek is not here.

45:27.459 --> 45:30.709
Even if he is, I won't give him to you.

45:32.001 --> 45:34.376
What about this, if I can beat you,

45:35.167 --> 45:36.334
you give me Ken Shek.

45:36.584 --> 45:38.917
If you dare touch him, I will ruin her face.

45:40.542 --> 45:42.834
I only meant beating him at table tennis.
No need to be alarmed for that.

45:44.251 --> 45:46.126
Well, you should have said that earlier.

45:46.501 --> 45:48.626
That's right, you should have said it earlier.

45:51.501 --> 45:53.084
How do you want to play?

45:53.084 --> 45:55.126
If anyone from your side
can take 1 point from me,

45:55.667 --> 45:57.209
then you win, and I'll leave.

45:57.334 --> 45:59.251
He's so arrogant.

46:00.334 --> 46:01.417
I go first.

46:02.001 --> 46:03.584
No, let me do it.

46:04.334 --> 46:05.667
I'll serve first.

46:32.126 --> 46:34.334
- Where are my glasses?
-That's really bad.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.501
I'll crush you in the next round.

46:38.584 --> 46:39.917
Here.

46:40.334 --> 46:41.709
Thank you.

46:42.167 --> 46:43.417
That wasn't too bad.

46:43.542 --> 46:44.667
So so.

46:46.584 --> 46:47.542
Let him serve first.

46:47.542 --> 46:49.251
When he does, you smash it.

46:49.251 --> 46:50.417
I smash it.

46:53.876 --> 46:54.834
Your turn to serve.

47:46.376 --> 47:49.167
Good tools are prerequisite to success.

47:49.834 --> 47:53.709
We can't blame you,
the problem is the cheap paddle.

47:53.917 --> 47:56.042
You have already played very well.

47:58.876 --> 47:59.917
She's right.

48:00.834 --> 48:03.292
You'll win him if you're using a steel paddle.

48:05.751 --> 48:06.917
Your turn, little girl.

48:10.459 --> 48:11.751
Wait.

48:12.501 --> 48:13.292
I need un peu de calme.

48:13.417 --> 48:15.376
You don't need Un-peu-de-calme.
I will get her for you.

48:15.834 --> 48:17.334
Stay focused on the match.

48:20.292 --> 48:21.542
Let me serve.

48:26.959 --> 48:28.251
Kill.

48:58.626 --> 48:59.459
Kill.

49:09.417 --> 49:11.167
We're gonna lose again.

49:19.917 --> 49:23.626
I haven't had to use my Heavenly Sword
for a long time.

49:23.876 --> 49:26.584
You've got to be the first to make me use it.

49:27.126 --> 49:28.626
Ken Shek.

49:28.667 --> 49:31.751
No, I'm Zhang Wu-ji.

49:32.084 --> 49:35.917
Today, I have come to retaliate for
my godfather Golden Lion King's death.

49:35.917 --> 49:38.251
I have to destroy...
you good-for-nothing loser...

49:38.376 --> 49:40.292
Speedy-fists Cheng Kun's...

49:40.459 --> 49:43.667
...odor! Watch this!

49:45.667 --> 49:47.126
That's a real good move.

49:47.959 --> 49:48.959
Where is your paddle, Mr. Zhang?

49:51.167 --> 49:52.751
I have my Dragon Saber.

49:53.417 --> 49:55.459
Come. Show me what you've got.

50:02.626 --> 50:03.459
Faster.

50:05.917 --> 50:06.959
Faster.

50:07.751 --> 50:08.876
That's too slow.

50:09.667 --> 50:10.417
Faster.

50:23.917 --> 50:27.751
Beat him, beat him, beat him.

50:57.084 --> 50:58.042
The ball is broken.

50:59.209 --> 51:01.834
This round doesn't count. Let's start again.

51:11.001 --> 51:13.709
No. I don't want to play anymore.
You are playing too hard.

51:13.709 --> 51:15.334
- I'm leaving.
-I said let's have another round.

51:23.667 --> 51:24.626
Do you really want me to play again?

51:24.626 --> 51:27.084
Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I'm not scared of you.

51:37.334 --> 51:39.626
That's amazing. What kind of ball is that?

52:27.501 --> 52:28.667
It's been a while.

52:30.501 --> 52:31.376
Chocolate.

52:31.376 --> 52:32.376
Thank you.

52:47.334 --> 52:48.834
Since everybody's here...

52:49.167 --> 52:51.084
This Saturday at Paradise Island, Thailand,

52:51.084 --> 52:54.834
I am having a birthday party with
card games for charity,

52:56.459 --> 52:58.334
you are all invited.

53:01.292 --> 53:03.376
I don't take no for an answer.

53:06.834 --> 53:09.126
Ok we'll see you then.

53:09.959 --> 53:11.042
Good.

53:22.792 --> 53:25.876
Ken, you are a good actor.

53:28.542 --> 53:29.667
Oh, Mother Ruthless, I'm a guy,
you can't touch me like that.

53:29.667 --> 53:30.251
Hold him tight.

53:30.251 --> 53:32.501
Why do you take my pants off?

53:32.501 --> 53:33.626
Don't do that.

53:33.834 --> 53:34.667
Don't do that.

53:37.501 --> 53:40.667
Master, I'm glad Bro Long Wu's
target-drug came just in time.

53:40.917 --> 53:43.084
J.C. hasn't shown his face for a long time.

53:43.167 --> 53:45.417
That's why I have decided to come
and meet him in person.

53:46.167 --> 53:47.126
Boss.

53:47.709 --> 53:48.667
Let's go.

53:49.376 --> 53:50.126
Yes, Sir.

54:04.626 --> 54:06.376
I didn't know you do this stuff too.

54:07.084 --> 54:08.459
Apart from being a hacker,

54:08.626 --> 54:11.876
I am also an inventor
in the underground market.

54:12.376 --> 54:14.126
You do this too?

54:14.667 --> 54:17.084
Michael is robot fanatic,

54:17.667 --> 54:19.542
he had invented 23 robots before,

54:19.542 --> 54:21.626
but they didn't have a mind,
so he tore them all apart.

54:21.626 --> 54:23.209
Only Skinny was allowed to stick around

54:24.917 --> 54:27.084
Why are you messing with
Only Yu's Gliders' Shoes?

54:27.876 --> 54:29.459
I am remodelling it.

54:29.459 --> 54:32.626
After remodelling, its stability will improve.

54:32.876 --> 54:34.584
I have other inventions. Come, let me show you.

54:36.126 --> 54:37.584
Making use of the spare parts here,

54:37.667 --> 54:39.292
I have compiled a High Intelligence

54:39.292 --> 54:41.917
Super Robe-armor.

54:42.751 --> 54:43.501
How high are we talking?

54:44.834 --> 54:45.917
As 'high' as Yao Ming.

54:48.126 --> 54:49.542
Let me show you how it works.

54:51.792 --> 54:55.167
I know it looks a little cheesy,
but it's highly functional.

54:59.667 --> 55:00.959
Does it really work?

55:05.084 --> 55:06.126
I didn't do it on purpose.

55:10.417 --> 55:12.001
I was 2-time champion of MMA.

55:12.001 --> 55:13.667
Don't tell me you haven't heard about it.

55:18.917 --> 55:20.126
Moron.

55:37.667 --> 55:38.792
Molly.

55:48.584 --> 55:49.376
Molly.

55:53.542 --> 55:55.001
Don't come any closer.

55:55.292 --> 55:59.001
This body I'm in,
I'm better off dead than alive.

56:00.834 --> 56:02.084
Why?

56:02.751 --> 56:07.376
You won't understand.
I am in more agony than being dead.

56:08.626 --> 56:11.251
What are you hiding from me, please tell me.

56:11.959 --> 56:12.876
Ken.

56:14.167 --> 56:15.542
I miss you.

56:27.042 --> 56:29.834
Ken, I hate you to death.

56:32.542 --> 56:33.876
No.

56:49.126 --> 56:52.501
Molly, you are looking great today.

56:53.584 --> 56:55.834
I watched a movie today...
there was a huge gorilla.

56:57.709 --> 56:58.959
He's in love with a girl.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.542
But the girl wanted to get away from him.

57:01.876 --> 57:04.251
He didn't care, he kept guarding her.

57:04.251 --> 57:05.917
He would guard her against anybody
who came close to her.

57:07.959 --> 57:09.376
He got rid of all the bad guys for her.

57:09.501 --> 57:12.876
One day, a dinosaur appeared to hurt her.

57:15.334 --> 57:17.417
The gorilla jumped in between them.

57:18.334 --> 57:19.667
He yanked the dinosaur's jaws apart.

57:21.001 --> 57:22.417
The dinosaur died instantly.

57:22.917 --> 57:26.001
At last, the girl fell in love
with the gorilla.

57:26.709 --> 57:28.334
They are like us.

57:29.834 --> 57:31.376
They are like us.

57:33.126 --> 57:36.209
Molly, I saw Ken Shek.

57:36.417 --> 57:38.417
He is just common.

57:40.584 --> 57:41.626
Maybe a little taller than I am.

57:44.167 --> 57:45.209
I will bring him here.

57:45.751 --> 57:48.459
I will make him die before you. Okay?

57:49.751 --> 57:51.417
I will make him die before you.

57:53.709 --> 57:55.501
I will make him die before you.

57:56.292 --> 57:58.459
I will make him die before you.

58:10.751 --> 58:13.542
Boss, your coffee.

58:19.917 --> 58:21.167
Thank you.

58:21.334 --> 58:23.417
You're welcome.

58:35.501 --> 58:36.834
Okay.

58:47.792 --> 58:53.084
Boss, you don't have to worry.
No matter what happens,

58:53.084 --> 58:55.876
I will still be at your side.

58:59.501 --> 59:00.709
Thank you.

59:00.917 --> 59:02.626
That's my job.

59:06.959 --> 59:09.667
- You are so smart.
-Come, let me help you.

59:09.667 --> 59:10.542
Okay.

59:11.001 --> 59:12.834
Robot Stupid, are you trying to
take advantage of her?

59:12.834 --> 59:14.042
- I didn't take advantage of her.
-How are you, Miss?

59:14.042 --> 59:15.042
You still haven't finished cooking?

59:16.709 --> 59:19.292
Why haven't you put the mushrooms in?
I'll kick your butt.

59:19.376 --> 59:20.459
I know MMA too.

59:20.459 --> 59:22.626
I really hate gambling.

59:25.167 --> 59:27.667
Come, let me kiss you.

59:27.667 --> 59:29.209
I'm scared.

59:29.209 --> 59:31.667
Come on, babe.

59:32.126 --> 59:33.876
Come on, kiss me.

59:34.959 --> 59:36.751
Why do you get so close?

59:36.751 --> 59:39.251
Just one kiss. It's okay.

59:39.251 --> 59:41.001
Close your eyes.

59:41.084 --> 59:43.792
We'll get an electric shock. Get away from me.

59:44.167 --> 59:45.126
Come on.

59:47.959 --> 59:48.751
This is so embarrassing.

59:48.751 --> 59:51.209
Skinny, don't go.

59:51.209 --> 59:53.751
My legs are sleeping. Come and help me up.

59:58.292 --> 01:00:00.042
Long Wu Jr., take this to protect yourself.

01:00:00.876 --> 01:00:02.334
Aunt-aunt, these are yours.

01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:03.542
Are you leaving now?

01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:06.209
Why not take my icecream maker with you?

01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:08.209
This is a weapon of mass destruction.

01:00:08.209 --> 01:00:10.001
- You'd better keep it for yourself.
-Right.

01:00:10.001 --> 01:00:12.251
You can't just leave like this.
Something is missing among you.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:13.376
What is missing?

01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:14.459
Tacit agreement.

01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:18.001
This is a micro audio-visual communicator.

01:00:18.001 --> 01:00:20.459
You can communicate by hearing or sight,

01:00:20.459 --> 01:00:22.209
so no one will get lost.

01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:23.917
Testing.

01:00:23.917 --> 01:00:26.001
How can you test it when we are so close?
I'm going upstairs.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.251
- I'm going to the roof.
-Basement for me.

01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:28.251
How about me?

01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:30.501
I'm so sorry. I am one short .

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.334
Don't worry, I have a spare one.

01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:38.626
This is the size of a pool ball.
How can I get it in my ear?

01:00:38.626 --> 01:00:41.709
Not a problem. Just add some lubricant.

01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:43.001
Really?

01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:48.709
How is it?

01:00:48.959 --> 01:00:50.876
Not bad. It feels quite comfortable.

01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:52.251
I told you it's comfortable.

01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:54.501
Why don't you take it out
and put it back again?

01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:55.501
I want to feel comfortable one more time.

01:00:55.501 --> 01:00:56.542
Sure.

01:00:59.376 --> 01:01:00.459
See, it's comfortable.

01:01:00.459 --> 01:01:01.084
Yes.

01:01:01.084 --> 01:01:01.917
Want to do it again?

01:01:01.917 --> 01:01:04.584
Let me put it in yours, so you can experience
how comfortable it is.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:14.542
It's very comfortable, but hard to breathe.

01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:29.251
Michael, my hypnotic skills
have improved a lot lately.

01:01:29.459 --> 01:01:30.459
Really?

01:01:31.334 --> 01:01:32.126
Look at me.

01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:35.459
On the count of 3,

01:01:36.251 --> 01:01:37.709
you will forget you are a pig.

01:01:37.709 --> 01:01:38.667
But I'm not a pig.

01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:40.501
See what I mean? Pig!

01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:46.001
You are making so much noise.

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:49.001
Chocolate.

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:50.376
You are the God of Gamblers.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.626
Thank you.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:02.459
I don't understand why we don't get inside,
it's pouring out here.

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:04.459
I guess because we look cool.

01:02:04.709 --> 01:02:06.709
Then shall we take a selfie first?

01:02:20.292 --> 01:02:23.917
Michael, this is just a private business.

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:25.292
You shouldn't get too involved.

01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:28.751
I just want to help Master Ko and Bro Long Wu.

01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:33.001
But what can I say,
you look so much like my master.

01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:33.917
Thank you.

01:02:36.334 --> 01:02:38.417
Hey, don't come close to me. You stink.

01:02:39.126 --> 01:02:40.417
There are ants on my side.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.709
They will bite you. They bite you.

01:02:43.917 --> 01:02:44.584
It's so filthy.

01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:48.251
Welcome.

01:02:48.251 --> 01:02:50.001
Mr. J.C., happy birthday.

01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:52.042
Where is Mr. Ko?

01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:53.959
Do I really look so much like him?

01:02:57.209 --> 01:02:58.959
- Let's take a picture together.
-Sure.

01:02:58.959 --> 01:02:59.917
Let me take the picture for you.

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.501
My arms are longer, let me do it.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.126
Thanks.

01:03:09.709 --> 01:03:10.876
Enjoy yourselves.

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:11.959
I'll see you tonight.

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:13.959
Good. See you tonight.

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:23.251
The God of Gamblers never takes pictures.

01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:37.959
The water has got into my head.

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:40.626
Stupido, are you okay?

01:03:40.626 --> 01:03:41.667
I'm okay.

01:04:08.209 --> 01:04:09.417
Mr. J.C.

01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:10.959
This is a great party.

01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:13.709
The guests here tonight are all famous
businessmen and politicians,

01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:15.209
and also royalties.

01:04:15.209 --> 01:04:16.959
They all wanted to see
the God of Gamblers in real person.

01:04:17.292 --> 01:04:19.251
Tonight we are playing for charity.

01:04:19.459 --> 01:04:21.292
The 3 general managers of our enterprise

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:22.501
have set up 3 contest rings,

01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:25.084
one for mahjong, one for dice,
and one for poker.

01:04:25.334 --> 01:04:27.751
The party that loses will have to donate
US$100 million for each ring.

01:04:27.876 --> 01:04:29.542
All the money will go to charity.

01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:31.209
- So, if we lose in all of them,
-Hi.

01:04:31.209 --> 01:04:32.584
We will be losing US$300 million.

01:04:33.501 --> 01:04:36.501
I'm sure US$300 million
means nothing to Mr. Ko.

01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:44.584
Moreover, in God of Gamblers' dictionary,

01:04:44.584 --> 01:04:45.959
the word "lose" does not exist.

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:47.917
You are too kind.

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.584
But we do need more charity money

01:04:50.584 --> 01:04:54.417
to help those who have
lost their families in war.

01:04:55.584 --> 01:04:57.542
Wars are everywhere in this world.

01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:02.834
They are all caused by illegal ammo traders.

01:05:04.959 --> 01:05:06.542
You are very right.

01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:10.209
Well, let's do this,
no matter who wins or who loses,

01:05:10.459 --> 01:05:12.042
I will donate US$300 million.

01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:13.751
Thank you.

01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:21.709
Ladies & Gentleman, Mahjong King and Queen.

01:05:41.126 --> 01:05:42.126
That's nothing.

01:05:44.417 --> 01:05:46.751
It's a jungle out there.
You'd better be careful.

01:05:47.542 --> 01:05:48.834
Why are you so concerned for me?

01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:51.542
You won't really think
I am interested in you, will you?

01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:55.126
Never trust a smiling cat.

01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:00.959
"Loving you"

01:06:00.959 --> 01:06:03.542
"Those charming eyes"

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:06.167
"That enchanting laughters."

01:06:06.167 --> 01:06:09.292
"I long to touch you again"

01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:10.376
That's enough.

01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:15.501
And a song for me?

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:19.084
"Give me a drink of forgetting potion..."

01:06:19.334 --> 01:06:20.501
Get out.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:44.584
You are...

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:45.667
"Auntie Six"

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:48.001
"Granduncle 3"

01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:51.876
"Let's all play mahjong
with a happy smile."

01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:56.417
"Work is over, play hard then."

01:06:56.417 --> 01:07:00.084
"Let's play some mahjong
and see who's the hero."

01:07:00.209 --> 01:07:04.292
"Who is the big hero?"

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:05.876
"Big hero."

01:07:07.959 --> 01:07:11.709
"Taking my tiles, I got 3 dongs."

01:07:12.001 --> 01:07:15.459
"I'm calling out 3 tiles
that will make me win."

01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:19.501
"My winning tile gets robbed. Poor me."

01:07:19.792 --> 01:07:23.876
"I'm furious and flushing."

01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:28.917
"Two of the parties are trying to cheat."

01:07:29.501 --> 01:07:33.084
"They are sending signals to each other."

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:36.792
"They are creating chances
for the other to win. Scoundrels!"

01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:40.501
"I can't get out of this mess."

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:46.542
"He keeps feeding me the bad tiles."

01:07:47.001 --> 01:07:50.876
"I am trying to maintain my cool."

01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:54.084
"Although inside I'm steaming
like a rice dumpling."

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:58.459
"And I'm shaking like a huge lantern."

01:08:00.584 --> 01:08:03.834
"Big scholar, Little scholar."

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:07.876
"When you get conned,
your plans will be messed up."

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:12.001
"Played a foul game,
I got penalized."

01:08:12.209 --> 01:08:16.542
"I feel dizzy like a spinning bear."

01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:21.292
"I have a mixed hand,
awaiting my lucky 7."

01:08:21.959 --> 01:08:24.959
"With Green as eyes,
I'm waiting for Red to win the game."

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:29.167
"I have tiles 6 and 8.
I need 7 to complete the valid chow."

01:08:29.584 --> 01:08:33.001
"It so happened she got the 7."

01:08:33.001 --> 01:08:37.376
"Time makes hero."

01:08:37.501 --> 01:08:40.501
"So she is the Big Hero."

01:08:40.501 --> 01:08:42.376
"Big hero."

01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:44.584
Of course. I am from the Ko's family.

01:08:48.084 --> 01:08:49.209
Landlady?

01:08:57.501 --> 01:09:01.042
Ladies & Gentleman, the Dice Queen.

01:09:10.001 --> 01:09:11.626
Let me get this round.

01:09:14.501 --> 01:09:16.542
- Please don't sing again.
-I know you are touched.

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:56.667
It's chilly in here. Don't catch a cold.

01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:50.917
I think there is not even one dot on your dice.

01:12:15.126 --> 01:12:16.334
Please take your time in counting them.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:19.792
Bye.

01:12:35.126 --> 01:12:36.376
Robot Stupid, Robot Skinny.

01:12:36.959 --> 01:12:37.709
Bro Mark.

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:38.792
What have you found?

01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:40.417
While we were swimming over here,

01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:42.667
we've scanned the seabed
and found 18 levels of basement.

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:45.001
And there was a red wine cellar,

01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:46.292
a gym, and a game centre,

01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:47.626
-and a sauna room...
-That's enough.

01:12:47.626 --> 01:12:48.501
Skinny.

01:12:55.626 --> 01:12:56.584
- Send it to everyone.
-Yes, Sir.

01:12:56.834 --> 01:12:59.001
I have sent you all a map.

01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:01.209
Follow the map's instructions,
and you will find us.

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:01.834
Got it.

01:13:01.834 --> 01:13:02.584
Copy.

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:28.917
This is really an arsenal.

01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:32.292
Robot Stupid, video all the evidence.

01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:33.209
Yes sir.

01:13:38.751 --> 01:13:41.751
Winning or losing is just part of the game.
Don't take it seriously.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:42.959
You might win next time.

01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:45.001
But I'm a very aggressive person.

01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:48.709
Let's raise the stake for this last game:
Battling the Landlord

01:13:49.417 --> 01:13:51.084
-$500 million.
-Sure.

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:53.459
Let me introduce a friend
who will be playing with us.

01:13:54.084 --> 01:13:57.751
He is a rich Korean merchant, Mr. Wong.

01:13:57.959 --> 01:14:00.501
Also known as the Universal King of Poker.

01:14:10.501 --> 01:14:11.251
Your show.

01:14:11.251 --> 01:14:12.834
Don't worry, my friend.

01:14:21.626 --> 01:14:25.959
Mr. Ko Chun, I've heard a lot about you.

01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:33.417
Let's do it.

01:14:42.126 --> 01:14:43.251
Let me be the Landlord.

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:46.251
- Okay?
-Okay-

01:14:46.626 --> 01:14:49.459
You want to be the Landlord.
You must have a good hand then.

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:50.876
Oh yeah.

01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:03.584
I'm not giving you any chance. Bomb.

01:15:09.126 --> 01:15:11.834
If Landlord does not deal, I will continue.

01:15:17.001 --> 01:15:17.917
My turn.

01:15:23.459 --> 01:15:24.667
You are supposed to be a team.

01:15:27.167 --> 01:15:28.126
Can I not beat yours?

01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:31.001
Sure. Continue.

01:15:38.917 --> 01:15:40.584
I'm the king.

01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:45.959
Pass.

01:15:46.126 --> 01:15:47.626
Pass?

01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:58.251
Landlord's hand is quite strong.
Will you help me?

01:16:00.626 --> 01:16:01.792
I don't think I can.

01:16:03.876 --> 01:16:08.042
My old man, J.

01:16:17.459 --> 01:16:18.376
Thank you.

01:16:27.084 --> 01:16:28.376
Don't you want me to lose?

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:29.792
Why would I?

01:16:55.084 --> 01:16:56.001
Bomb.

01:17:07.626 --> 01:17:09.084
Sky Explosion.

01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:12.251
Game over.

01:17:18.376 --> 01:17:19.667
Mr. Ko.

01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:21.209
Let's do it one more time,

01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:22.709
and let's make it simple.

01:17:23.084 --> 01:17:24.667
Let's just pick one card

01:17:24.792 --> 01:17:28.334
and let's see who gets the bigger one,
how about that?

01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:29.417
I like it.

01:19:05.334 --> 01:19:06.251
Mr. Ko.

01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:08.834
Are you alright?

01:19:09.167 --> 01:19:10.042
I'm okay.

01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:13.084
Your friend has a powerful aura.

01:19:14.292 --> 01:19:18.126
Let us switch. Old man goes first.

01:19:43.376 --> 01:19:45.626
I assume this card is good enough
to beat yours.

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.292
Okay, let's see.

01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:08.751
Can you see what I have in my hand?

01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:10.417
You see what I got.

01:20:27.167 --> 01:20:28.834
See it, everybody.

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:32.209
Look at this, look at what I have in my hand.

01:20:32.917 --> 01:20:35.167
Mr. Ko, your hypnotic skill is so remarkable!

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:36.209
Since you are so aggressive,

01:20:36.209 --> 01:20:38.042
why not play a game with me?

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.834
I'm afraid we don't have enough time.

01:20:42.126 --> 01:20:42.751
Why?

01:21:54.501 --> 01:21:55.667
- Ghost!
-Really?

01:21:56.209 --> 01:21:57.209
That's freaky.

01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:00.084
Stupido.

01:22:00.084 --> 01:22:00.959
Run.

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:06.959
Run.

01:22:14.084 --> 01:22:15.626
Is this not the defense system created

01:22:15.626 --> 01:22:17.334
by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory?

01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:18.417
It's got dual encryption, and also...

01:22:18.417 --> 01:22:19.917
Get out of my way.

01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:36.751
Let's go.

01:22:55.876 --> 01:22:57.042
Stupido, what should we do?

01:22:57.126 --> 01:22:58.584
Don't worry. I'm here.

01:23:09.792 --> 01:23:10.751
- Don't worry.
-Skinny, don't be afraid.

01:23:10.876 --> 01:23:11.751
Get out.

01:23:29.001 --> 01:23:29.917
Robot Stupid.

01:23:30.584 --> 01:23:31.584
After you.

01:23:31.584 --> 01:23:33.501
Okay, I'll go first.

01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:37.501
Stupido, hip hip hurray.

01:23:37.501 --> 01:23:39.834
- Skinny, don't be afraid.
-Stupido, you are so cool.

01:23:39.834 --> 01:23:42.667
Stupido, you are so handsome.

01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:44.542
- That's enough, go take them out.
-Go go go!

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:45.751
- Bite its throat, go.
-You are gorgeous.

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:55.792
If I can't get out of this alive,

01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:58.167
please take our baby back to Singapore.

01:23:58.459 --> 01:24:00.626
Are you nuts? When did I ever have your baby?

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:05.209
That's very high.

01:24:16.959 --> 01:24:17.959
Stupido.

01:24:18.334 --> 01:24:20.667
Afrodie Missile.

01:24:26.792 --> 01:24:29.167
Skinny, you're great.

01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.126
Stupido.

01:24:30.126 --> 01:24:31.834
- Give me a kiss, babe.
-Kiss kiss.

01:24:34.126 --> 01:24:35.084
Kiss kiss.

01:24:41.126 --> 01:24:42.167
What are you doing?

01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:43.251
What was that?

01:24:47.292 --> 01:24:48.251
Let me do it.

01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:53.126
I'm doomed.

01:25:04.042 --> 01:25:05.334
Skinny.

01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:10.959
I will kill you.

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:27.417
Skinny.

01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:31.084
Stupido.

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.209
Skinny.

01:25:32.584 --> 01:25:33.292
Skinny.

01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:35.459
Stupido.

01:25:35.792 --> 01:25:37.126
Skinny.

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:41.417
- Stupido.
-Skinny.

01:25:43.834 --> 01:25:44.876
Skinny.

01:25:44.876 --> 01:25:45.834
Stupido.

01:25:45.834 --> 01:25:48.001
Skinny.

01:25:48.459 --> 01:25:49.834
Stupido.

01:25:53.376 --> 01:25:55.417
Skinny.

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:56.959
Stupido.

01:26:00.209 --> 01:26:01.626
Skinny.

01:26:04.584 --> 01:26:06.167
We are fellow robots,

01:26:06.167 --> 01:26:07.834
maybe we have overdone it.

01:26:10.751 --> 01:26:11.792
Stupido.

01:26:13.084 --> 01:26:17.792
Skinny, I'm sorry, I didn't protect you well.

01:26:17.959 --> 01:26:21.126
It doesn't matter, Stupido.

01:26:21.917 --> 01:26:29.251
I am happy we can die together.
I have no regrets.

01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:31.709
I love you.

01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:32.876
Skinny.

01:26:32.876 --> 01:26:35.167
I love you.

01:26:37.376 --> 01:26:38.042
Skinny.

01:26:39.126 --> 01:26:40.667
Skinny.

01:26:41.417 --> 01:26:43.251
Skinny.

01:26:43.751 --> 01:26:45.376
Skinny.

01:26:47.084 --> 01:26:48.376
If anything happens to you,

01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:51.334
I will bring your baby back to Singapore.
Don't worry.

01:26:52.292 --> 01:26:53.334
Moron.

01:27:06.001 --> 01:27:06.751
Robot Stupid.

01:27:06.876 --> 01:27:07.542
Robot Stupid.

01:27:07.876 --> 01:27:08.792
Robot Stupid.

01:27:08.876 --> 01:27:10.501
Are you cold?

01:27:10.501 --> 01:27:12.709
Did you see the light at the end of a tunnel?

01:27:13.001 --> 01:27:15.292
Don't sleep. You won't wake up again.

01:27:24.042 --> 01:27:25.417
What are you doing?

01:27:31.876 --> 01:27:35.251
Take this super transforming control.

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:40.126
Press it on top, it will...

01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:45.751
I can't hear what you are saying.

01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:34.251
The power is great,

01:28:34.792 --> 01:28:36.542
But I can't seem to get the balance.

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:38.417
Nothing I cannot handle.

01:29:09.376 --> 01:29:11.084
How dare you touch my woman?

01:29:12.584 --> 01:29:14.501
Come on, babe.

01:29:17.501 --> 01:29:19.209
Don't look at me like that.

01:29:22.626 --> 01:29:25.292
I had rather lose my cell phone
than lose my Kitty.

01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:26.751
Then where is your cell phone?

01:29:26.751 --> 01:29:28.167
Find it yourself.

01:29:28.376 --> 01:29:35.334
Cell phone...

01:29:35.334 --> 01:29:37.376
Okay, here you are.

01:29:39.042 --> 01:29:40.001
Go hide.

01:30:26.042 --> 01:30:27.834
Are you blind? Did you not see me
spinning round?

01:30:27.834 --> 01:30:29.001
I couldn't brake.

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:30.751
Get out of the way, you Rhino.

01:30:30.751 --> 01:30:32.917
Hey we are fellow robots,
you don't have to yell.

01:30:32.917 --> 01:30:35.792
Stop fighting. Time to finish off.

01:30:51.417 --> 01:30:52.584
Sit.

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:53.417
Sit.

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:56.542
Hand.

01:30:59.542 --> 01:31:00.876
Jump.

01:31:01.626 --> 01:31:02.626
Roll.

01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:10.751
Where is your switch?

01:31:11.459 --> 01:31:12.626
What switch?

01:31:12.626 --> 01:31:13.876
Where?

01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:15.667
Here.

01:31:15.667 --> 01:31:16.626
Shut it off.

01:31:20.084 --> 01:31:21.876
Good boy.

01:31:23.459 --> 01:31:24.876
Good boy.

01:33:30.876 --> 01:33:31.959
He has a birdie.

01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:36.334
Who?

01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:39.084
Who?

01:33:41.751 --> 01:33:42.501
I'm one of yours.

01:33:43.792 --> 01:33:44.709
I'm one of yours.

01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:46.376
Hey, I'm one of yours.

01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:48.626
Hey, I'm one of yours.

01:33:50.126 --> 01:33:50.792
Hey, I'm one of yours.

01:33:57.001 --> 01:33:59.084
9 of them are robots,
only one is the real Michael.

01:33:59.542 --> 01:34:02.084
I've got an idea. This is my newest invention.

01:34:02.292 --> 01:34:04.167
This switch is made to disturb and

01:34:04.167 --> 01:34:05.959
counter control robots' electric waves.

01:34:06.167 --> 01:34:10.667
I call it the Laboratory Emergency Button.
Press it.

01:34:18.209 --> 01:34:20.084
Music.

01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:31.834
"I will have fun by myself,
I don't need your chains."

01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:36.209
"Goodbye for now,
I will get company when I am lonely."

01:34:36.209 --> 01:34:39.792
"I will have fun by myself,
but I'm not used to doing it."

01:34:40.251 --> 01:34:44.126
"Goodbye for now, but I dare not relax."

01:34:44.292 --> 01:34:47.959
"I will have fun by myself,
I don't need your chains."

01:34:48.292 --> 01:34:52.084
"Goodbye for now,
I will get company when I am lonely."

01:34:52.334 --> 01:34:56.167
"I will have fun by myself,
but I'm not used to doing it."

01:34:56.376 --> 01:35:00.126
"Goodbye for now, but I dare not relax."

01:35:00.126 --> 01:35:01.542
Time to detonate.

01:35:23.167 --> 01:35:24.459
- What's the score?
-100

01:35:25.917 --> 01:35:28.751
You are a better fighter than your father.
Smile.

01:35:29.292 --> 01:35:31.376
But he looks cooler. Let's go.

01:35:49.751 --> 01:35:50.626
Ken Shek.

01:35:51.667 --> 01:35:53.709
Do these handcuffs fit you?
Are they comfortable?

01:35:54.001 --> 01:35:56.584
You knew all along I am a fake.
Why didn't you kill me?

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:58.251
Oh, I will surely kill you.

01:35:59.209 --> 01:36:01.376
I promised Molly that
I will let her see you die.

01:36:04.417 --> 01:36:05.584
Why is she like this?

01:36:07.209 --> 01:36:08.584
What did you do to her?

01:36:08.667 --> 01:36:10.292
I did nothing to her.

01:36:10.917 --> 01:36:12.084
What did you do to her?

01:36:41.376 --> 01:36:42.501
Molly.

01:37:04.417 --> 01:37:06.209
You made her jump off the plane.

01:37:06.209 --> 01:37:08.459
The rapid change in high pressure
hurt her brain severly.

01:37:08.667 --> 01:37:10.417
It was you that put her in this state.

01:37:11.751 --> 01:37:15.334
You are right. I was bad to her.

01:37:16.167 --> 01:37:18.667
Kill me, let me die with her.

01:37:22.459 --> 01:37:23.792
You are not qualified to do that.

01:37:24.334 --> 01:37:25.501
In this world,

01:37:26.042 --> 01:37:28.834
no matter Molly is alive or dead,

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:32.292
the only person that is
fit to be with her is me.

01:37:32.584 --> 01:37:36.334
If you love her so much,
why didn't you take her to the hospital?

01:37:38.626 --> 01:37:40.292
This is the best hospital in the world.

01:37:40.917 --> 01:37:42.917
And I am the best brain specialist
in the world.

01:37:43.501 --> 01:37:46.042
She is now better off dead than alive.
You selfish monster.

01:37:46.959 --> 01:37:49.709
It's you who brought this on her.

01:37:50.376 --> 01:37:52.709
And it's me who saved her.

01:37:54.917 --> 01:37:56.751
I am the true love of her life.

01:38:02.834 --> 01:38:05.042
Go to hell, Ken Shek.

01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:32.167
No need to be afraid.
These are just normal plastic cards.

01:38:32.751 --> 01:38:34.584
You won't get shocked.

01:38:34.834 --> 01:38:35.959
What more great moves do you have?

01:38:36.417 --> 01:38:38.167
You haven't seen my best move.

01:39:07.417 --> 01:39:09.542
I've said you would die before her.

01:39:48.834 --> 01:39:50.084
Molly.

01:39:52.334 --> 01:39:53.542
Are you fine now?

01:40:03.417 --> 01:40:06.542
"Falling in love is easy."

01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:10.417
"Because it won't be long."

01:40:11.376 --> 01:40:17.584
"It is so far yet
you think you can touch it."

01:40:17.584 --> 01:40:21.084
"Dwelling in the past is unfortunate."

01:40:21.084 --> 01:40:25.001
"Because it was once owned by me."

01:40:25.334 --> 01:40:31.667
"I am thinking of her every night."

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:39.376
"Unfortunately, we both knew we are
just passing by each other's life."

01:40:39.542 --> 01:40:45.667
"Love is just a silouhette that is illusive
and no one can claim it."

01:40:46.042 --> 01:40:53.709
"Save the precious moment in our hearts."

01:40:53.709 --> 01:41:00.167
"And don't let time ruin the love
we had from the start."

01:41:00.167 --> 01:41:03.126
"We can let go,"

01:41:03.334 --> 01:41:06.584
"or we can hide the cuffs"

01:41:06.751 --> 01:41:13.376
"that are wet with tears."

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:17.376
"Do not try to keep it here,"

01:41:17.376 --> 01:41:20.876
"And do not turn back..."

01:41:21.001 --> 01:41:27.334
"Keep the memories forever."

01:41:28.084 --> 01:41:31.626
Molly, it's my fault.

01:41:32.876 --> 01:41:34.459
It was me who put you through this.

01:41:36.501 --> 01:41:38.792
I had had a dream.

01:41:40.834 --> 01:41:45.167
I saw you coming down the stairs.

01:41:47.167 --> 01:41:48.834
I told you,

01:41:51.209 --> 01:41:53.459
I miss you so much.

01:41:54.334 --> 01:41:56.626
Then you came and held me close.

01:41:58.876 --> 01:42:00.626
But I never thought.

01:42:02.751 --> 01:42:05.959
My dreams could come true today.

01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:13.709
Have you ever dreamed about me?

01:42:18.126 --> 01:42:20.876
To be able to die in your arms,

01:42:23.751 --> 01:42:27.001
I'm truly satisfied.

01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:31.251
"We can let go,"

01:42:31.584 --> 01:42:34.959
"or we can hide the cuffs"

01:42:34.959 --> 01:42:41.334
"that are wet with tears."

01:42:42.001 --> 01:42:45.459
"Do not try to keep it here,"

01:42:45.542 --> 01:42:49.084
"And do not turn back,"

01:42:49.167 --> 01:42:55.167
"Keep the memories forever."

01:42:56.251 --> 01:42:59.709
"The flower has withered."

01:42:59.709 --> 01:43:03.251
"And time has passed."

01:43:03.251 --> 01:43:09.542
"None of this will be missed."

01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:13.792
"The heart has stopped."

01:43:13.792 --> 01:43:17.292
"The air has died."

01:43:17.292 --> 01:43:25.501
"My love has come to a halt."

01:44:13.501 --> 01:44:16.292
Look, it's like this.

01:44:23.292 --> 01:44:24.209
You mean like this?

01:44:24.209 --> 01:44:25.834
- Good.
-Very nice.

01:44:26.251 --> 01:44:28.709
Aunt-aunt, you want to try this?

01:44:28.792 --> 01:44:30.084
How can anyone eat it? It's too hot.

01:44:31.167 --> 01:44:32.042
That's true.

01:44:37.792 --> 01:44:38.876
Do you want some turnip cakes?

01:44:39.042 --> 01:44:41.209
How can anyone eat it? It's too cold.

01:44:46.209 --> 01:44:47.792
2 morons.

01:44:48.626 --> 01:44:51.459
Why are you still like this? Your daughter and
son in law have both awaken.

01:44:51.626 --> 01:44:52.584
Exactly.

01:44:52.584 --> 01:44:54.709
My daughter has got married,

01:44:55.042 --> 01:44:57.626
Molly is not coming back anymore,

01:44:57.834 --> 01:45:01.876
and Robot Stupid
is on the stairway to heaven.

01:45:01.876 --> 01:45:04.751
My brothers, don't you think I should be sad.

01:45:04.876 --> 01:45:06.459
Well then, we will give you some more likes.

01:45:06.459 --> 01:45:08.001
Don't you think it's cool?

01:45:10.959 --> 01:45:12.417
Kung Hei Fat Choy.

01:45:13.126 --> 01:45:13.876
Bro Wu.

01:45:14.626 --> 01:45:15.709
Kung Hei Fat Choy.

01:45:15.834 --> 01:45:18.626
Ken, why do you look like that?

01:45:18.917 --> 01:45:19.792
Who made you angry?

01:45:19.792 --> 01:45:21.459
Bro Wu, you tell me.

01:45:21.792 --> 01:45:23.501
What's worth being happy about now?

01:45:23.959 --> 01:45:25.251
You never know.

01:45:25.292 --> 01:45:28.001
Congratulations.

01:45:28.001 --> 01:45:30.542
I took out the memory units
from Stupid and Skinny,

01:45:30.667 --> 01:45:34.084
And I rebuilt a new body for them,
better than the one before.

01:45:35.084 --> 01:45:37.126
Boss.

01:45:38.334 --> 01:45:39.876
Stupid.

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:41.626
Boss.

01:45:41.876 --> 01:45:44.417
Stupid, I'm so happy to see you again.

01:45:44.459 --> 01:45:45.584
Boss.

01:45:47.084 --> 01:45:48.542
- Yes, Sir.
-I didn't think

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.167
I would ever see you again.

01:45:50.167 --> 01:45:52.376
Don't say that. It's bad luck to say
that at Chinese New Year.

01:45:52.667 --> 01:45:54.042
Honey, come and greet Boss.

01:45:54.042 --> 01:45:55.001
Master, how are you?

01:45:55.001 --> 01:45:57.167
- You are very pretty.
-Thank you.

01:45:57.167 --> 01:46:00.167
Boss, you always asked me to be "productive".

01:46:00.167 --> 01:46:05.584
So Skinny and I created the babies
with spare parts,

01:46:05.584 --> 01:46:07.167
here they come.

01:46:08.167 --> 01:46:11.542
Stupido Jr., Tiny Skinny.

01:46:17.834 --> 01:46:19.334
They're adorable.

01:46:19.751 --> 01:46:22.667
They are truly adorable, I love them.

01:46:23.751 --> 01:46:26.251
Ken, so you are happier now?

01:46:26.376 --> 01:46:28.167
Thanks to you, bro.

01:46:28.167 --> 01:46:30.709
Grand dad, coffee or tea?

01:46:32.084 --> 01:46:33.042
Anything will do.

01:46:41.167 --> 01:46:42.209
You're peeing everywhere again?

01:46:52.584 --> 01:46:54.251
Cut it out.

01:46:55.084 --> 01:46:56.542
There's so much pee.

01:46:57.959 --> 01:46:59.834
Mark, move in a little.

01:47:02.667 --> 01:47:04.834
Stay still. Baby, don't move.
