[muffled]:
Hi, I'’m Bonnie.

00:04.917 --> 00:05.830
I'’m an alcoholic.

00:05.918 --> 00:07.137
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.617
I know I sound like
a broken record,

00:08.704 --> 00:10.227
but I really miss my boyfriend.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.448
Marjorie, do me a favor,

00:13.535 --> 00:15.015
after the meeting,
tell everybody what a record is.

00:16.581 --> 00:19.106
Anyway... [sighs]

00:19.193 --> 00:21.238
he and I tried
to do the Skype thing,

00:21.325 --> 00:23.197
but I can just
feel it slipping away,

00:23.284 --> 00:27.288
so right now, I'’m just about
as low as I'’ve ever been.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.029
There'’s really only one thing

00:29.116 --> 00:30.117
that'’s bringing me
any joy at all.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.641
This cream filling.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.429
And without a boyfriend,

00:38.516 --> 00:40.127
it'’s the only cream filling
I'’m getting.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.391
[muffled]:
Thank you.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.350
Anybody want to follow that?

00:46.437 --> 00:47.351
What the hell.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.092
Christy, alcoholic.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.702
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.183
I know I'’m usually
all doom and gloom,

00:53.270 --> 00:54.924
but not today.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.796
Today I am cheerful,
not fearful.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.537
Happy, not crappy.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.538
Delighted, not...

01:00.625 --> 01:01.757
We get it. We get it.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.542
I officially got accepted

01:04.629 --> 01:06.631
into Sonoma State University.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.372
Go Seawolves.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.287
So, starting this fall,

01:10.374 --> 01:13.421
I will be one step closer to
my dream of becoming a lawyer.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.466
But wait, there'’s more.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.903
My daughter'’s getting married
in a few weeks,

01:17.990 --> 01:20.080
and, get this, she doesn'’t have
to get married,

01:20.167 --> 01:21.690
she'’s doing it by choice.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.301
That'’s a family first.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.609
Of course, I did drop four grand
on her wedding dress,

01:27.696 --> 01:30.264
and I will probably have to rob
a bank to pay my tuition,

01:30.351 --> 01:33.571
but I refuse to let money
worries ruin my good mood.

01:33.658 --> 01:34.703
That'’s what my mom is for.

01:38.446 --> 01:39.708
Who else would like to go?

01:39.795 --> 01:41.101
I'’ll go.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.580
Hi, I'’m Jill,
I'’m an alcoholic.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.191
What are you doing?

01:44.278 --> 01:45.279
[muffled]:
I'’m sorry, it'’s all I got.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.542
Mmm.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.766
I hope you'’re aware
you'’re eating your feelings.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.638
Hey, I got to put
something in my mouth.

01:56.725 --> 01:57.943
My boyfriend'’s in Croatia.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.294
Nice, Mom. Classy.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.557
No, no, they don'’t make
French fries for happy people.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.649
CHRISTY:
Violet.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.216
What'’s going on?
Are you okay?

02:09.303 --> 02:10.651
[sobbing]:
No!

02:10.739 --> 02:12.784
Aw, what happened?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.525
Gregory broke up with me.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.092
The wedding is off.

02:16.179 --> 02:19.443
Oh, my God.
[sobbing]

02:19.530 --> 02:22.229
Would it be okay
if I moved back in with you?

02:24.318 --> 02:25.493
[sobbing]

02:25.580 --> 02:27.582
Now you may have a fry.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.934
♪

02:47.906 --> 02:49.386
So what did the bastard do?

02:49.473 --> 02:50.953
We don'’t know
that he'’s a bastard.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.389
He'’s seeing someone else.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.217
That bastard.

02:55.697 --> 02:56.611
What tipped you off?

02:56.698 --> 02:57.916
Does he come home,

02:58.003 --> 02:59.657
take a shower,
then go straight to bed,

02:59.744 --> 03:02.182
too tired for sex '’cause
he had a rough day at work?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.662
Mom, this isn'’t about
what men have done to you.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.708
I'’m talking about
what I'’ve done to men.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.798
Has he lost weight lately?

03:09.885 --> 03:10.886
Did he join a gym?

03:10.973 --> 03:12.104
Yeah, he has.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.105
Teeth whitening strips

03:13.193 --> 03:14.455
or did he go to the dentist?

03:14.542 --> 03:16.326
He went to the dentist!

03:16.413 --> 03:17.414
Oh, honey.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.111
I'’m so sorry.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.983
[sighs] Wait,

03:21.070 --> 03:23.725
before we bury
this relationship,

03:23.812 --> 03:25.379
have you and Gregory
talked about

03:25.466 --> 03:26.815
going and seeing a therapist?

03:26.902 --> 03:28.773
Mom, he doesn'’t love me anymore.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.558
Just let it go!

03:34.692 --> 03:36.433
How much did you spend
on the wedding dress?

03:36.520 --> 03:37.391
Shut up.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.961
BONNIE:
How much time do we have?

03:43.048 --> 03:44.398
Not a lot.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.138
Let'’s just grab her stuff
and get out.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.792
What about those big potted
plants in the lobby?

03:47.879 --> 03:50.012
We'’re not here
to just randomly steal things.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.579
Then why'’d you bring me?

03:54.277 --> 03:56.323
Hello?

03:56.410 --> 03:57.324
Gregory?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.413
We'’re good.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.675
You get Violet'’s clothes,

04:00.762 --> 04:02.111
I'’ll get the rest of her stuff.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.286
Got it.
[door closes]

04:03.373 --> 04:04.592
Christy?
Yeah?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.333
Are we just gonna
get her things,

04:06.420 --> 04:08.160
or are we gonna go all
helter skelter on the joint?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.336
Just getting her things.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.728
We'’ll revisit it on the way out.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.781
Does Violet drink espresso?

04:20.869 --> 04:22.827
CHRISTY:
I don'’t know, maybe.

04:22.914 --> 04:23.915
Then this is probably hers.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.792
You'’re eating his food?

04:30.879 --> 04:33.621
May I remind you
that cheating son of a bitch

04:33.708 --> 04:35.013
broke your daughter'’s heart.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.928
Clear out the fridge.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.457
I feel like we hit the jackpot
at Bed, Bath and Beyond.

04:45.241 --> 04:48.070
You think that'’s
Violet'’s giant flat screen TV?

04:48.157 --> 04:49.854
It'’s bigger than ours, so yes.

04:54.729 --> 04:55.643
Oh.

04:57.949 --> 04:58.950
Hello.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.909
Phyllis, hi.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.911
We didn'’t expect
to see you here.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.653
Yeah, I get that
from the looting.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.352
We'’re just getting
my daughter'’s things.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.049
And some of my son'’s.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.964
I gave him that
espresso machine.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.662
Oh.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.273
Sorry, it looks just like
the one we gave Violet.

05:19.231 --> 05:21.451
Okay, we'’re just gonna
take this stuff out to the car,

05:21.538 --> 05:23.758
and then I'’ll come back for
the rest of Violet'’s clothes.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.456
I'’m sorry things
didn'’t work out.

05:26.543 --> 05:30.242
Yeah, me too,
but what are you gonna do?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.418
Your son met someone else.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.028
[chuckling]: What?

05:33.115 --> 05:35.117
Please.

05:35.204 --> 05:38.381
My Gregory with two women
at the same time?

05:38.468 --> 05:40.035
Two donuts, maybe.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.995
That'’s what Violet said.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.997
Are you saying
my daughter lied to me?

05:46.084 --> 05:49.436
Yeah.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.525
Or maybe you raised
a scumbag of a son.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.309
Oh, now he'’s a scumbag?

05:53.396 --> 05:57.226
You really don'’t have
a second gear, do you?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.097
Well, what did Gregory tell you?

05:59.184 --> 06:03.667
My son,
who has never lied to me,

06:03.754 --> 06:06.627
told me that Violet
has been drinking a lot

06:06.714 --> 06:09.717
and doing the pot
and the ecstasy.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.067
Okay, first of all,

06:12.154 --> 06:14.809
there'’s no "the"
in front of pot and ecstasy.

06:14.896 --> 06:18.769
You would know.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.815
And I think I would know
if Violet had a problem.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.207
You sure about that?

06:23.861 --> 06:25.646
You know what, Phyllis?

06:25.733 --> 06:27.343
I'’ve got a daughter at home
crying her eyes out.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.127
I am not gonna stand here
and argue with you.

06:29.214 --> 06:29.954
I'’ll stay.

06:30.041 --> 06:30.955
Come on!

06:35.046 --> 06:36.961
Screw her, blaming Violet.

06:37.048 --> 06:40.443
Well, wait till she realizes
she'’s having mustard for dinner.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.879
And we'’re taking those plants.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.841
I said I'’d know

06:46.928 --> 06:48.756
if Violet had a problem
with drugs and alcohol,

06:48.843 --> 06:51.323
but the more I think about it,
I'’m not sure.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.803
Oh, come on.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.675
Are you gonna listen
to Mahjong Sally?

06:54.762 --> 06:57.025
Why would she lie?

06:57.112 --> 06:59.636
Well, she'’s just repeating
what Gregory told her.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.856
We'’re just repeating
what Violet told us.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.248
So, who you gonna believe?

07:03.335 --> 07:05.033
[sighs]
I want to believe my daughter,

07:05.120 --> 07:06.295
but, you know,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.689
when has that ever worked out?

07:08.776 --> 07:09.820
VIOLET:
Mom?

07:09.907 --> 07:10.821
In the kitchen.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.257
This might get heavy.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.302
Will it bother you
if I make popcorn?

07:17.785 --> 07:18.655
Did you get all my stuff?

07:18.742 --> 07:19.700
It'’s on the sofa.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.353
And in the fridge.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.356
You didn'’t happen
to see Gregory, did you?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.576
No, but we ran into his mother.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.318
Really?

07:29.405 --> 07:31.102
What'’d she say?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.844
Well, she kind of had
a different take on things.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.411
What does that mean?

07:37.805 --> 07:39.241
[sighs]

07:39.328 --> 07:41.504
She said that the reason
you and Gregory broke up

07:41.591 --> 07:43.506
was because...

07:43.593 --> 07:44.812
you'’ve been partying a lot.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.901
And you believed her?

07:46.988 --> 07:49.556
No, but I think it'’s worth
having a conversation.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.166
Why don'’t you ever take my side?

07:51.253 --> 07:52.559
You always think the worst.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.125
Well, then tell me otherwise.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.344
Tell me you'’re
not getting loaded.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.693
I shouldn'’t have to.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.868
I think you should
just trust me.

07:57.955 --> 07:58.869
I do, it'’s just...

07:58.956 --> 08:00.567
I am in college, Mom.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.177
I go out with my friends,

08:02.264 --> 08:03.961
we have drinks.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.050
Occasionally,
we'’ll smoke a little bit of pot.

08:06.137 --> 08:09.140
We are not all drunks
and drug addicts like you two!

08:09.227 --> 08:10.577
Hey!

08:10.664 --> 08:12.492
I only did drugs
to manage my alcoholism.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.628
So what do you think?

08:18.715 --> 08:20.325
I don'’t know.
I want to believe her.

08:20.412 --> 08:21.413
But do you?
Do you?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.459
I asked you first.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.896
If I'’m gonna be honest,
I'’m worried.

08:25.983 --> 08:29.030
Think we should ask her to go to
an AA meeting with us?

08:29.117 --> 08:30.074
Be kind of cool.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.206
We'’d have our own row.

08:31.293 --> 08:33.121
Yeah.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.470
Nothing cooler than that.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.433
My question is,

08:42.522 --> 08:43.697
how do I tell the difference

08:43.784 --> 08:45.525
between a full-blown alcoholic,

08:45.612 --> 08:48.092
and a normal college student
who'’s just having fun?

08:48.179 --> 08:49.441
That'’s a tough one.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.269
It'’s like kids today use college

08:51.356 --> 08:54.185
as an excuse to stay drunk
all the time.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.665
It'’s not just today.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.014
When I went to San Diego State,

08:57.101 --> 08:59.408
my sorority had vodka on tap.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.238
Best seven years of my life.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.196
Do you remember jungle juice?

09:05.283 --> 09:06.546
[gasps]
Oh, yeah.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.548
Kool-Aid, fruit
and grain alcohol

09:08.635 --> 09:10.724
all mixed together
in a giant trash can.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.116
[chuckles]

09:12.203 --> 09:13.378
I remember one time
I was drinking

09:13.465 --> 09:14.858
that stuff at a frat party,

09:14.945 --> 09:16.512
and I puked through
the screen door.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.253
The juice went outside,

09:18.340 --> 09:20.385
and the chunks of fruit stayed
in the kitchen with me.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.563
[groans]

09:27.044 --> 09:29.612
This is not making me
feel better.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.396
Well, hang on.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.573
A lot of my college roommates
partied just as much as I did,

09:33.660 --> 09:35.313
and they don'’t have a problem.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.752
Other than being in loveless
marriages with ugly children.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.799
Christy, I know it'’s painful
because it'’s your kid,

09:42.886 --> 09:44.845
but nothing changes the fact

09:44.932 --> 09:47.282
that this is
a self-diagnosed disease.

09:47.369 --> 09:48.892
So I'’m just supposed
to do nothing?

09:48.979 --> 09:50.111
You can pray for her.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.026
So nothing.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.291
Ooh, you know what was
another great college drink?

09:56.378 --> 09:57.466
Vodka and Tang.

09:57.553 --> 09:58.815
Oh, I loved those.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.513
The screwdriver
the astronauts drank.

10:01.601 --> 10:06.170
Okay, the point is only Violet
can say if she has a problem,

10:06.257 --> 10:08.520
and if that day
ever does come,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.480
at least she has a sober mom
who will know how to help.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.829
And grandmother.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.396
Sure.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.277
It'’s 2:00 a.m.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.583
What are you doing?

10:27.670 --> 10:28.932
Prepping some ribs.

10:29.019 --> 10:29.977
Want a slab?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.414
No.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.981
What'’s going on?

10:34.068 --> 10:35.460
[sighs] I was having
phone sex with Adam,

10:35.547 --> 10:37.811
and lost the connection
right before I...

10:37.898 --> 10:39.987
Anyway, I'’m making
spicy and mild.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.597
Take your pick.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.338
[sighs] I'’m gonna
gain so much weight

10:43.425 --> 10:45.514
'’cause your boyfriend'’s
out of town.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.863
What are you doing up?

10:46.950 --> 10:48.212
I couldn'’t sleep.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.519
I kept listening
for Violet to come in.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.216
Ooh, I forgot about her.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.827
That could have been awkward.

10:55.611 --> 10:58.701
It'’s so weird having
her back in the house.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.008
I mean, I know
she'’s not a kid anymore,

11:01.095 --> 11:02.662
but I still worry like she is.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.315
Mmm, I know how you feel.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.100
When you were her age
and staying out all night,

11:06.187 --> 11:07.362
I was a nervous wreck.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.407
You used to wait up for me?

11:09.494 --> 11:11.409
Of course.
I mean, I had a little help

11:11.496 --> 11:13.542
from the old Peruvian
marching powder,

11:13.629 --> 11:15.196
but, uh, that only added

11:15.283 --> 11:16.545
to the paranoia.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.329
For a while there,

11:18.416 --> 11:21.202
I was convinced the CIA
had replaced you with a clone.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.378
[softly]: How do you know
they didn'’t, Mom?

11:24.988 --> 11:26.381
Don'’t do that.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.078
[phone ringing]

11:28.165 --> 11:30.385
Oh, God, this can'’t be good.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.736
Hello?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.390
Who?

11:35.477 --> 11:36.739
Oh, Phyllis.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.046
What'’s wrong?

11:39.133 --> 11:40.917
Oh, no.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.224
What?Violet showed up at Gregory'’s

11:43.311 --> 11:44.878
drunk off her ass.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.227
Phyllis, I am so sorry.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.663
We'’ll be right there.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.753
Okay.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.798
She'’s alive.

11:51.885 --> 11:52.799
What do you want to do?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.757
Kill her.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.498
Just let me get these ribs
in the oven, and I'’ll drive.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.416
I'’m so sorry
about this.

12:01.503 --> 12:04.114
Yeah, well, what are
you gonna do, you know?

12:04.201 --> 12:05.550
The joys of parenthood.

12:05.637 --> 12:06.900
Really?

12:06.987 --> 12:08.597
Curlers?

12:08.684 --> 12:10.207
Forgive me.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.644
I didn'’t know
I'’d be entertaining.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.298
Where is Violet?

12:14.385 --> 12:15.822
Last I looked, she was puking

12:15.909 --> 12:17.998
in the toilet I cleaned
just this afternoon.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.739
I got this.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.264
I'’d offer you something to eat,

12:23.351 --> 12:25.092
but there'’s nothing
in my refrigerator!

12:28.225 --> 12:30.793
Oh, yeah,
sorry about that.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.664
Where'’s Gregory?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.537
Well, he was pretty upset about
the relationship falling apart,

12:35.624 --> 12:38.192
so he and a couple of friends
went to Mexico

12:38.279 --> 12:41.151
to catch fish
and maybe chlamydia.

12:41.238 --> 12:44.502
Did Violet happen to mention
why she showed up here

12:44.589 --> 12:45.852
in the middle of the night?

12:45.939 --> 12:47.505
Between the booze
and the crying,

12:47.592 --> 12:49.507
she wasn'’t making
a lot of sense,

12:49.594 --> 12:52.684
but I think she'’s still in love.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.035
Oh. My poor baby.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.384
Yeah.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.646
It'’s very sad.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.173
You know, some very fashionable
women still use curlers.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.091
[retching]

13:11.529 --> 13:12.792
Very colorful.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.445
What is that, Jell-O shots?

13:14.532 --> 13:16.491
Yeah.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.449
See, your old grandma knows
what the kids are drinking.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.889
Are you gonna tell me
I'’m an alcoholic?

13:22.976 --> 13:25.195
Nope, that'’s up to you
to decide.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.545
I will tell you
you have vomit in your hair,

13:27.632 --> 13:30.722
so you can draw
your own conclusions.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.681
I just miss Gregory.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.336
I get it. We'’re having
pork ribs for breakfast

13:35.423 --> 13:36.293
because I miss Adam.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.686
Ribs?

13:37.773 --> 13:39.688
[retching]

13:39.775 --> 13:41.211
That'’s okay.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.257
More for me.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.172
I always thought if I got her
through her teen years,

13:45.259 --> 13:46.913
it would get easy.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.089
[chuckles] You know when
it gets easy being a mother?

13:49.176 --> 13:50.525
When you'’re dead.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.703
And even then,
you might worry a little.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.363
I owe you an apology.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.541
I know that Gregory
wasn'’t cheating on Violet.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.196
You don'’t have
to apologize.

14:09.283 --> 14:12.112
We all want to believe
our own child.

14:14.331 --> 14:17.857
I just can'’t help feeling
like it'’s my fault.

14:17.944 --> 14:22.122
I drank, and now Violet drinks.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.733
Do you blame your mother
'’cause you drank?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.432
I used to.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.826
Not anymore.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.395
Then why don'’t you give yourself
a break with Violet?

14:37.006 --> 14:39.617
Yeah, maybe.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.316
Besides, if it'’s always
the parents'’ fault,

14:42.403 --> 14:44.927
then I have to be responsible
every time my son behaves

14:45.014 --> 14:47.277
like a pompous schmuck.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.584
"A pompous schmuck"?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.586
I say it with love.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.244
Well, I always liked Gregory.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.986
I mean, I had my doubts
about their relationship,

15:00.073 --> 15:04.164
but... I liked it that Violet
had someone to take care of her.

15:05.687 --> 15:08.255
She still has someone
to take care of her.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.084
Oy.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.913
[chuckles]
Oy, indeed.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.307
I think she'’s empty.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.700
[sighs]

15:18.787 --> 15:20.615
Let'’s get you home.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.748
Thank you, Phyllis.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.446
Yeah, I'’d say anytime,

15:25.533 --> 15:27.622
except I think once is enough.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.844
You know, even though
the wedding'’s off,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.717
doesn'’t mean we
can'’t be friends.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.415
Aw, you really need
a mom, don'’t you?

15:38.502 --> 15:40.156
So bad.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.636
BONNIE:
Hey.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.290
I'’m standing right here.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.640
Call me.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.516
[sighs]
Look at her.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.476
Just a few days ago,
she was someone else'’s problem.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.086
Hey, that'’s your daughter.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.306
She'’s not a problem,
she'’s a burden.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.960
Good point.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.309
You can solve a problem.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.011
I still don'’t know
if she'’s one of us.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.317
I'’m thinking not.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.275
Why?

16:12.362 --> 16:14.190
God doesn'’t tell the same joke
three times in a row.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.497
[sighs]
Boy, I hope not.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.194
Give her time.
She'’ll settle down.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.892
And if she doesn'’t,
she knows where to go.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.329
I guess.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.638
Hey, Mom,

16:27.725 --> 16:29.901
I'’m sorry for all those nights
I made you wait up for me.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.904
Thank you. [chuckles]

16:32.992 --> 16:35.777
I always thought I wasn'’t
hurting anybody but myself.

16:35.864 --> 16:39.041
Well, the important thing is
we have each other now.

16:42.392 --> 16:45.308
This hug would mean more
if you stopped chewing.
