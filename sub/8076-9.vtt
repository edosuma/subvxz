[theme music playing]

00:09.310 --> 00:12.646
MAN: Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.547
Don't crowd her.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.117
Give her some air.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
I have good news.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.986
Your family is fine.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.254
A highway patrolman found them.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.689
And he's bringing
them right over here.

00:21.722 --> 00:22.723
Good.

00:22.756 --> 00:27.395
And you, Roseanne
Conner, are a hero.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.197
You have taken
the American woman

00:29.230 --> 00:32.133
from housewife to international
terrorist fighter.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.404
So tell us how it happened.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.038
We want to hear all the details.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.075
OK, well, it was really
weird because there we

00:41.109 --> 00:45.346
were, headed to Washington
DC with a friend of ours,

00:45.379 --> 00:47.148
Dr. Harundi V Bakshi.

00:47.181 --> 00:47.981
And--

00:50.684 --> 00:52.620
Oh, Dr. Bakshi,
I'd really like

00:52.653 --> 00:54.522
to thank you for
inviting us to come along

00:54.555 --> 00:56.624
with you to Washington DC.

00:56.657 --> 01:01.995
Yes, little did I know that
you would actually accept.

01:02.029 --> 01:05.633
Well, I hope we're
not imposing, Doctor.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.936
Well, I know I
am not imposing.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.539
I always get along
with foreigners.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.342
The key is to remember
that there are people too

01:14.375 --> 01:16.510
and it's not their fault
that they were born

01:16.544 --> 01:20.047
in some barbaric heathen land.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.016
Right, Dr. Bakshi?

01:23.050 --> 01:24.285
Whatever.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.086
[whistle]

01:26.120 --> 01:28.256
Oh, my, you really--

01:28.289 --> 01:31.091
really enjoying that
whistle, aren't you, Andy?

01:31.125 --> 01:34.228
All the way from Boston.

01:34.262 --> 01:37.165
I'm going to have to find a
very special way of thanking

01:37.198 --> 01:40.534
grandma for getting you that.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.970
So have you given
any thought to what

01:43.003 --> 01:44.405
you want to see in Washington?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.174
Oh, yeah, I want
to go see all the

01:46.207 --> 01:47.575
important historical places.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.909
Superb.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.712
We'll start with my favorite,
the Lincoln Memorial, then

01:51.745 --> 01:52.946
the Capitol building.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.182
No, forget that crap.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.285
No, I want to see that
elevator where Bob Packwood

01:57.318 --> 01:59.086
goosed his secretary, you know.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.156
Hey, and then I want
to go over to Congress

02:02.190 --> 02:04.057
and sit in the back and oink.

02:04.091 --> 02:07.428
What do think of that, Harundi?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.329
Excuse me.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.965
I've lost my fannie pack.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.168
You know what I
want to see in DC?

02:14.202 --> 02:16.604
Chelsea Clinton.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.406
I can see it now.

02:18.439 --> 02:22.310
We're having dinner, a
nice chat about Bosnia.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.546
Then I run my fingers
through tawny her hair.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.814
Hey, DJ, I'm starving.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.182
Let's go up to the
dining car, all right?

02:28.216 --> 02:29.783
No way.
This is first class.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.519
They're going to bring
the food right to us.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.087
And they're a little late too.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.424
Everybody up.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.126
We are taking control
of this train.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.663
You are now our hostages.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.133
This better be
better dinner theater.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.435
[music playing]

02:47.468 --> 02:51.472
(SINGING) What doesn't kill
us is making us stronger.

02:51.505 --> 02:56.444
We're going to last longer than
the Greatest Wall in China.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.413
Oh, that rapping with the drum.

02:59.447 --> 03:05.886
If there's one thing I've heard
while waiting for my turn,

03:05.919 --> 03:11.325
it's that with any rainfall
but you also get some sun.

03:11.359 --> 03:15.296
And we'll make out
better than OK.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.698
Hey, hear what I say.

03:37.251 --> 03:41.522
Remind me never to use
Leon's travel agent again.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.692
Do not raise your voice.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.593
I'm not.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.494
This is my voice.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.028
I said quiet.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.799
It is a double sin, speaking
without being addressed and not

03:51.832 --> 03:54.402
whispering when you speak.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.903
OK, OK, fine.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.605
Just tell me what
you want from us.

03:57.638 --> 04:02.810
No, we only speak
to men, like him.

04:02.843 --> 04:06.280
Oh, now, I'm really scared.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.415
Enough.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.918
Take them to the holding
car, everyone but her.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.654
[screaming]

04:15.456 --> 04:16.457
[whistles]

04:16.490 --> 04:20.160
Andy, not in front
of the terrorists.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.763
If you touch one
hair on their heads--

04:22.796 --> 04:24.064
Silence.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.901
Tie her up and gag her.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.371
Her mouth is a sin
against nature.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.916
Stay here.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.084
Try to escape and
you'll be killed.

04:44.117 --> 04:44.985
OK.
No escaping.

04:45.018 --> 04:45.886
Oh.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.356
Woman, forgot, no talking.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.257
Oh, I'm still talking.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.896
You know, if he wasn't
holding a machine gun

04:55.929 --> 04:57.565
and weren't a bunch of
other terrorists around,

04:57.598 --> 04:59.833
and if I wasn't sober,
well, I'd kick his ass.

04:59.867 --> 05:00.668
What?

05:04.938 --> 05:08.642
Oh, this is horrible.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.144
What if they keep us
in here for months

05:11.178 --> 05:14.314
and we have to eat other
like those poor boys

05:14.348 --> 05:16.283
on that soccer team.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.919
We don't even know
why they're doing this.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.121
What is it they want?

05:21.154 --> 05:21.955
They want me.

05:25.959 --> 05:30.798
Hey, hey, hey,
we got him in here.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.435
DJ, they know he's in here.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.204
What's going on Dr. Bakshi.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.008
Those men are terrorists
from the country Monostan.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.376
I was going to give
a speech at the UN

05:42.410 --> 05:44.478
denouncing their country
for their horrible record

05:44.512 --> 05:45.946
on human rights.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.081
This is their attempt
to silence me.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.518
OK, OK, there's just one
thing I don't understand here.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.519
OK, what's the UN?

05:51.552 --> 05:52.352
You talk, mister.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.126
The UN is the United Nations.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.429
I was going to speak before
the General Assembly.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.897
And the speech would have
been on every television

06:03.931 --> 06:06.467
in every home
throughout the world.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.300
You mean like Baywatch?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.776
[muffled speech]

06:47.741 --> 06:49.209
Are you OK?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.278
Uh, huh.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.680
Well, you're in America now.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.014
Nobody can shut you up.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.583
And you don't have to
wear a ball in your mouth

06:55.616 --> 06:57.918
unless you get off on it.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.388
Tell me where my family is.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.790
Thank you.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.992
[non-english speech]

07:12.432 --> 07:15.368
Hey, relax or you're
going to pull something.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.271
[music playing]

07:21.308 --> 07:24.211
Our plan is working perfectly.

07:24.244 --> 07:28.048
Only ourselves and Bakshi
remain on the train.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.117
Soon someone should bring
them some food and drink.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.385
Sort of the last meal.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.587
Soba, do it.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.829
Is something wrong, Soba?

07:44.665 --> 07:48.969
Did you cut your hair.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.805
I say we kill that
infantile Bakshi right now.

07:54.708 --> 07:58.378
We must not deviate
from the plan.

07:58.411 --> 08:02.015
Bakshi and his
degenerate friends

08:02.049 --> 08:06.554
will all perish in two hours
when the train is derailed

08:06.587 --> 08:08.789
and plunges off the cliff.

08:11.592 --> 08:16.029
And then the whole world
will know our power.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.265
The power of the Monostan.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.878
Soba, more coffee.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.480
United Nation will
learn not to interfere

08:33.513 --> 08:36.049
with our internal affairs.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.986
The very idea being of being
upset at us just because we

08:39.019 --> 08:41.354
yank out the eye teeth of our
women, cut off their tongues

08:41.388 --> 08:45.425
and we sow their mouths
shut, what's that big deal?

08:45.458 --> 08:49.897
Ow, you clumsy wench.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.465
We even try to appease
the rest of the world

08:52.499 --> 08:54.935
by having a woman present.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.737
Perhaps we should have
let her make her speech

08:56.770 --> 09:00.007
before her mouth was sown up.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.442
[glass shatters]

09:02.475 --> 09:05.378
She is spirited, huh?

09:05.412 --> 09:08.682
It would be a joy to break her.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.985
This reminds me of a joke.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.322
If you push an English woman
and a Monostan woman out

09:15.355 --> 09:16.423
of the airplane
at the same time,

09:16.456 --> 09:17.524
who will hit the ground first?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.425
Huh?

09:18.458 --> 09:19.326
Huh?

09:19.359 --> 09:20.160
Who cares.

09:26.634 --> 09:30.037
I care, you silly bastard.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.973
[music playing]

09:33.006 --> 09:33.974
Get her.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.943
Get that talking devil woman.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.345
[music playing]

09:49.289 --> 09:50.223
She's gone.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.792
She must have fallen out.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.693
Good.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.994
I hope she died horribly.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.940
Eat you heart
out, hairy Scruggs.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.916
[phone ringing]

10:19.987 --> 10:21.955
Hello, listen, whoever
this is, I need help.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.390
MAN (ON PHONE): Who is this?

10:23.423 --> 10:24.291
MacGyver.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.458
What difference does it make?

10:25.492 --> 10:26.593
I need help.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.095
MAN (ON PHONE): I want
to speak to Dr. Bakshi.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.529
Well, he's a little
indisposed right now.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.430
Look I need--

10:30.463 --> 10:31.398
MAN (ON PHONE): No, you look.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.766
This is the FBI.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.036
We have information that Dr.
Bakshi is like maybe in danger.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.438
Yeah, well, big fat duh.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.674
There's push dudes on
this train and they

10:40.708 --> 10:42.042
have Bakshi and my family.

10:42.075 --> 10:46.279
So you guys better get your
butts on this train right now.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.716
Listen, I'm losing you.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.684
WOMAN (ON PHONE):
So, girl, go figure.

10:50.718 --> 10:55.322
Everyone in Melanie's party
got lucky except for Melanie.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.757
Phones.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.492
MAN (ON PHONE): Now we'll fly
help in as soon as we can.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.427
These men are dangerous.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.729
So don't do anything.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.096
But my family--

11:03.130 --> 11:05.899
MAN (ON PHONE): Ma'am, be a
good girl and don't do anything.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.068
Fine, I'll lay low
until you get here.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.406
Like hell I will.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.976
[rap music playing]

11:44.805 --> 11:46.006
This time, it's personal.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.347
[music playing]

12:03.290 --> 12:05.258
Avon calling.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.227
You're supposed to be dead.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.529
You boys put those
guns down right now.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.565
Don't make me pull
this train over.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.667
You just told your last joke.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.943
Check, please.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.846
Party's over.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.781
[sizzling sound]

12:27.815 --> 12:30.150
[screams]

12:33.653 --> 12:36.189
That's what we call
shooting the curve.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.830
You know what this is?

12:42.863 --> 12:43.663
Another tampon?

12:46.399 --> 12:49.169
[moans]

12:54.574 --> 12:57.777
Now you can ride
horses and swim.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.751
[zapping sound]

13:19.332 --> 13:23.436
You tell me where my family
is before I lose my cool.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.072
Nothing you can do
will make me talk.

13:25.105 --> 13:25.973
Oh, really?

13:26.006 --> 13:28.208
[screams]

13:28.241 --> 13:30.543
No, not the beard.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.945
I need it.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.214
I have no chin.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.115
All right.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.049
All right.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.152
But you're never going to make.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.188
Your family's nine cars back.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.890
Each car with eight cards.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.424
Each guard with seven guns.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.259
Each gun with six bullets.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.229
Didn't anybody ever tell
you that girls can't do math?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.804
That'll teach you to mess
with the mother of all mothers.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.376
DJ, we're manly men.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.844
We can burst this thing open.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.814
I'm trying.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.618
To think I made it through a
world war and the Korean War.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.420
Well, technically,
that wasn't a war.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.122
That was a police action.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.992
And now I'm seeing the
caboose of my life.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.995
Mother, don't talk like that.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.630
You're scaring Andy.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.797
Andy's asleep.

14:24.831 --> 14:28.035
Well, then you're scaring me.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.537
We got to get out of here.
Mom's all by herself.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.438
She's not alone.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.074
She's surrounded by terrorists.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.710
Oh, god, oh, go, I don't
want to be an only child.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.981
Relax, relax, I can
handle these guys.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.116
I took shop.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.818
(DRUNKEN SINGING)
The party's over.

14:45.852 --> 14:49.222
It's time to call it a day.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.625
Shut up!

14:52.659 --> 14:56.029
I do not want my last
moments on Earth polluted

14:56.063 --> 14:59.166
by your incessant crooning.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.002
What do you mean last moments?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.237
These are my middle moments.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.410
Someone needs to take control
of this situation right now.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.679
Someone with their
wits about them.

15:12.712 --> 15:16.149
And I guess it's going to be me.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.785
Excuse me for
being presumptuous.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.087
I've only known
you for two days.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.655
But you're an imbecile.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.457
So?

15:24.491 --> 15:26.826
Let's play a game.

15:26.859 --> 15:27.927
Well, how about Hangman?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.296
Oh, yeah, great, Mark.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.465
Hangman, that's really going
to make us forget about dying.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.201
Sorry, right, how
about this then.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.568
I'll say a word and
then we'll each add

15:35.602 --> 15:37.170
a word until we get a sentence.
OK?

15:37.204 --> 15:38.438
Ready?
I'm--

15:38.471 --> 15:39.872
Going--

15:39.906 --> 15:41.074
To--

15:41.108 --> 15:42.442
Die.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.845
[music playing]

16:19.512 --> 16:21.414
So nice of you to
join me on the veranda.

16:21.448 --> 16:25.852
It's pleasure, even
though it's your last.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.255
[yells]

16:32.325 --> 16:33.760
I love the train.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.229
It's so much safe
than air travel.

16:36.263 --> 16:39.699
Don't you agree?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.668
[laughs]

16:41.701 --> 16:45.305
Damn, I forgot how
famous you Monostanians

16:45.338 --> 16:47.340
for your hard jaws.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.543
Don't forget, we also
grow world famous sticks.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.446
[music playing]

16:59.452 --> 17:04.324
I've seen better
birds on a buffalo wing.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.993
You make me reassess
my opinion about women.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.363
You're even weaker and
more stupid than I thought.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.666
That is why you're so much fun
to put them in their place.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.107
You people are barbarians.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.676
In our country, we don't need
to spill blood to silence women.

17:23.710 --> 17:28.115
We do it with diet and
fashion and psychiatrists.

17:28.148 --> 17:31.818
Every country destroys
their women in their own way,

17:31.851 --> 17:34.254
because you are inferior.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.256
You may think
women are inferior,

17:36.289 --> 17:39.159
but there's one way
men are much weaker.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.667
Big Frank might be
tough, but little Frank

17:47.700 --> 17:50.603
is weak like all rest of them.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.515
Damn, I broke a nail.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.255
I'm playing any
more word game.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.958
OK, OK, OK, how
about Duck Duck Goose?

18:11.991 --> 18:12.892
No games.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.827
No games with any colors.

18:14.861 --> 18:15.795
Kill him.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.230
Kill him.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.299
Everybody, look at us.

18:19.332 --> 18:24.103
We're turning on each other
like a pack of wild dingos.

18:24.137 --> 18:27.740
Only God can save us now.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.676
What about goddess?

18:29.709 --> 18:33.112
Roseanne, you're alive.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.047
I knew you'd make it.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.516
I just knew it.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.085
Roseanne, that outfit,
it's hardly slenderizing.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.420
Shut up, Mom.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.922
This train is about to go
off a cliff in two minutes.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.257
You guys want to live?

18:44.291 --> 18:45.091
Follow me.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.231
OK, this train is going to
around a curve in a minute,

18:51.264 --> 18:53.065
so that will give
us time to jump off.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.100
Go DJ.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.868
I don't care what
anyone says, you're

18:55.902 --> 18:58.971
the best mom on the block.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.473
Well, Roseanne, I--

19:00.507 --> 19:02.442
[screams]

19:02.475 --> 19:06.879
If I don't make it, I
only hope in my next life,

19:06.913 --> 19:11.651
I come back as a
meat-eating woman like you.

19:11.684 --> 19:16.022
Roseanne, you're the ultimate
in feminine protection.

19:16.055 --> 19:19.859
Never jump out of train, Andy,
with a whistle in your mouth.

19:22.895 --> 19:26.766
You, go, girl.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.470
Becky really missed
a great trip, huh?

19:30.503 --> 19:33.273
[groans]

19:39.145 --> 19:41.681
- Hey, I owe you one, pal.
- Forget it.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.782
My treat.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.252
You know all those
times you screwed up?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.053
Well, this isn't one of them.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.989
I'm proud to call
you my son-in-law.

19:58.998 --> 20:02.201
Oh, my god, I can't believe
I'm going to die like this.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.371
That carnival psychic was right.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.378
Oh, at last, help from above.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.845
MAN (OVER LOUDSPEAKER):
This is the FBI.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.281
Grab onto the tire.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.786
[explosion]

20:19.819 --> 20:21.721
Clean up on aisle four.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.531
Well, Mrs. Conner,
it's been quite a day.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.132
If you feel up to
it, there's someone

20:33.165 --> 20:36.536
else who wants to meet you.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.739
Oh, my god, it's Hillary.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.542
Roseanne, it takes a
village to raise a child,

20:42.575 --> 20:44.377
but just one tough
cookie like you

20:44.411 --> 20:46.746
to whip a bunch of terrorists.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.615
Terrorists don't really
bother me, Hillary.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.550
After all, I had two
teenage daughters

20:50.583 --> 20:54.321
living in the same
house at the same time.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.355
See you at Barbara's.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.831
Well done, grasshopper.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.766
Oh, master.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.036
I've studied all of your
teachings as best as I could,

21:10.069 --> 21:14.307
especially those
available on video.

21:14.341 --> 21:17.444
But you did
resort to violence.

21:17.477 --> 21:24.116
I think you need to realize that
the only enemy is within you.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.085
If you can dissolve
into emptiness,

21:26.118 --> 21:28.988
you'll realize they
you cannot resist

21:29.021 --> 21:31.524
that which doesn't exist.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.926
This is the true
nature of shunyata.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.766
What he said.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.035
