WEBVTT

01:06.984 --> 01:07.985
Jericho.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.030
Mommy's right here!

01:17.369 --> 01:18.912
This meal should be special.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.374
I don't wanna shock her system.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.335
She's been eating pretty bland
in the hospital the last few months.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.880
Don't you have GQ this morning?

01:28.714 --> 01:31.425
It's Dorothy's first day back,
so she might need me.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.927
What Dorothy needs is normalcy.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.597
You should go.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.642
I should stay.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.020
We can handle things here for a morning.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.022
Go, get dressed.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.775
GQ's waiting.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.836
Morning.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.592
- No. I told Sean. I don't want--
- Well, Sean had to go to work.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.929
But don't worry,
he knows that you're in good hands.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.723
Where's my son?

02:20.474 --> 02:22.267
- Okay, let's sit you up--
- Don't touch me.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.603
I'm fine.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.605
You're in pain, Dorothy.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.776
I'll heal. Go away.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.283
I understand that you're hurting,
but you don't need to be cruel.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.372
Now, you ring this if you need me.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.249
Nobody else is gonna bother you today.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.630
So you can relax.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.931
Well, she won't touch the oatmeal.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.015
You look nice.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.728
Do you think that you could make this?

03:07.896 --> 03:11.108
It shouldn't be too hard, and I'm sure
Dorothy would really appreciate it.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.902
I wanna spend some time with Jericho
before lunch.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.238
Yeah, this is not gonna taste like Sean's.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.241
Fine.

03:20.868 --> 03:26.999
Oh, Leanne, I don't know if we should
be together while Dorothy's home.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.920
Well, Sean has to work.
Dorothy has to heal.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.006
We have to be them now.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.850
<i>The mass exodus
out of the city and into the suburbs</i>

03:44.933 --> 03:48.020
<i>is a contentious topic
amongst Philadelphia natives.</i>

03:48.103 --> 03:51.190
<i>Is our quaint and historic town
losing its charm?</i>

03:51.273 --> 03:55.527
<i>Marcia, a longtime local and mom of three,
shares her inside opinion.</i>

03:55.611 --> 03:57.821
<i>Philly isn't what it used to be.</i>

03:57.905 --> 03:59.489
<i>The city's dir--</i>

03:59.573 --> 04:01.450
You really shouldn't be watching this.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.203
Our city's just as beautiful
as it's ever been.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.124
Julian made you shakshuka.
Isn't that sweet?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.086
We thought that you might need
something with a little bit more flavor.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.255
Where's my brother? I wanna see him.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.134
Maybe in a little.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.220
How are you feeling?

04:22.721 --> 04:26.391
Itchy… and in pain.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.186
And I don't want you anywhere near me.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.316
Well, I'll speak to your doctor
about upping your medication.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.987
Time to eat.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.365
Dorothy.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.076
- Come on. Just one little bite.
- No.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.411
There you go.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.130
Now, I know that that was an accident.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.427
Sean said that your stomach
might take a little while to readjust.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.223
Hey, look, I wanna show you something.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.229
I made you this as a welcome home gift.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.359
It's made out of
all of Jericho's old clothes,

05:17.442 --> 05:20.153
the ones that he's grown out of
since you've been away.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.406
He's gotten really big.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.539
That's a mother's job…

05:32.583 --> 05:34.668
to get rid of all his old clothes.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.754
Not yours.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.800
Now you've taken that away from me too.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.789
Hey, what's up?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.375
<i>Is everything all right?
Dorothy's not answering my calls.</i>

06:17.211 --> 06:18.420
Everything's going fine.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.589
I'm sure she's just resting.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.466
<i>You in Leanne's closet?</i>

06:23.967 --> 06:26.428
I-- thought you wanted to talk in private.

06:27.012 --> 06:30.015
<i>Okay. Can you have
Dorothy call me? I wanna check in.</i>

06:30.098 --> 06:32.768
Don't worry, Sean.
Okay, the worst of it is over.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.534
I understand that you're angry at me.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.997
But what happened on the stairs
was an accident.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.170
And I'm very sorry about the blanket.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.590
That was wrong of me to not ask you.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.219
I have a surprise lunch guest.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.858
Oh, my sweet boy.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.027
Mommy missed you so much.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.487
Give him to me.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.989
Two bites first.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.792
Two more. Just like that.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.841
- Come here.
- Okay.

07:46.842 --> 07:47.885
- Okay.
- Hi.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.304
- You gonna see Mommy? Huh?
- Hi.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.557
- You're so big. Oh, my goodness.
- Put you down.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.809
Are you a good crawler?

07:55.893 --> 07:56.894
Yeah?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.396
You know,
I think he's gonna walk really soon.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
Yeah.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.233
I know I can't pick you up yet,

08:03.317 --> 08:05.569
but when I do, I'm gonna hold on to you.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.573
Yes. And then it's just gonna be
me and you forever and ever, little one.

08:12.284 --> 08:15.078
Okay.
I think that that's enough for today.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.332
No, I only had him for a minute.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.710
You can't overexert yourself,
Dorothy. Doctor's orders.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.794
Please.

08:27.799 --> 08:28.884
I hate you.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.452
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:00.123 --> 09:00.958
Everything okay?

09:03.669 --> 09:05.629
Dorothy just got back from the hospital.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.175
She thinks she knows what's best for her,
but she doesn't.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.178
She said that she…

09:20.143 --> 09:21.144
Sometimes…

09:23.772 --> 09:26.233
I find it best to just show people
you trust them.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.654
What up, Tobes?

09:32.030 --> 09:33.282
What are you doing here?

09:37.119 --> 09:39.454
Sean asked me to handle a couple things
while he's in production.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.291
So, I might be around.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.670
What are you doing here?

10:27.169 --> 10:28.170
For Dorothy.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.390
Hey, cutie!

10:41.683 --> 10:44.144
I've come for a visit
with our warrior queen.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.565
She's resting right now.
Maybe another time?

10:49.775 --> 10:50.817
She texted me.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.402
I'll show myself up.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.698
Just-- Excuse me.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.743
- Are these Miel?
- Fiore's.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.830
Oh, my God, they're unreal.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.999
Only the best for my girl.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.130
I brought flowers for Dorothy.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.259
Kort, can you close the door?

11:24.977 --> 11:25.978
Hey.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.354
What are you doing here?

11:27.437 --> 11:29.523
Is Dorothy okay?
She called, asked me to come home.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.400
She called you?

11:31.483 --> 11:33.402
Have you seen what's going on outside?

11:38.657 --> 11:41.410
Sean, Dorothy was asking for you.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.079
What's going on?

11:45.414 --> 11:48.709
- Gonna need a new tank.
- I know!

11:57.092 --> 11:58.468
We first noticed it--

12:07.853 --> 12:09.271
What the fuck?

12:28.624 --> 12:31.126
- Clear.
- All right, coming down.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.587
Got it.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.637
- Bedbugs.
- Gross!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.514
It looks like it's the whole neighborhood.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.641
It says here to check the seams.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.479
Fuck!

12:53.899 --> 12:55.526
I feel like they're all over me.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.278
What the fuck are we gonna do
about Dorothy?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.864
God. I'm calling Frank!

13:08.121 --> 13:09.748
What's going on?

13:11.375 --> 13:12.376
Hello?

13:17.881 --> 13:19.842
<i>Your call is very important to us.</i>

13:19.925 --> 13:21.677
- <i>Please stay on the line…</i>
- Oh, fuck.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.928
<i>…will be with you shortly.</i>

13:25.556 --> 13:27.516
<i>Your call is very important to us.</i>

13:27.599 --> 13:28.600
<i>Please stay on the line,</i>

13:28.684 --> 13:30.727
<i>and a representative
will be with you shortly.</i>

13:34.857 --> 13:35.983
Jesus.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.318
Dad?

13:41.363 --> 13:43.657
I, for one,
will not be destroying my suit.

13:45.909 --> 13:46.994
It's Tom Ford.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.334
Did you call the exterminator?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.712
I've been on hold for 30 fucking minutes.

13:56.795 --> 13:57.796
Oh, Lord.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.465
How's Dorothy?

14:00.549 --> 14:04.136
I haven't been up there.
She's been texting the whole time.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.806
I don't think we can move her,
so I don't know what to say.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.309
Well, let's leave it that way.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.936
No use frightening her.
Wait until we can get some help.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.230
She might injure herself trying to move.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.443
She's okay. I think Leanne's with her.

14:32.956 --> 14:33.957
Hold still.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.834
What are you doing?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.420
A little self-care goes a long way.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.007
I know you haven't been yourself lately.
This will help.

14:42.591 --> 14:43.675
Leanne.

14:43.759 --> 14:47.221
I used to shave my uncle,
so I have a very steady hand.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.599
Where is everyone? Where's Kourtney?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.726
I think she's having a shower.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.270
A shower?

14:56.146 --> 14:59.733
You know, you really didn't need to
call Kourtney or Sean.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.027
I mean, we're fine.
You and me, on our own.

15:03.195 --> 15:07.115
Leanne, get off me!

15:09.409 --> 15:12.079
Fine, I'll leave you half-finished
if that's what you want.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.331
Here,
why don't we do a little bit of color?

15:14.873 --> 15:17.251
- Here, why don't we try a little color?
- What, no!

15:21.505 --> 15:22.506
Fuck!

15:26.927 --> 15:27.928
Cheers.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.685
So, may I be so bold

15:34.768 --> 15:37.563
as to broach the subject of you
banging the nanny?

15:39.314 --> 15:40.357
You're one to talk.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.402
Kourtney's been around,
what, nine, ten months now?

15:44.027 --> 15:45.529
When's her expiration date?

15:48.073 --> 15:53.495
She makes me happy, Julian.
They all did for a while, at least.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.499
She make you happy? The nanny.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.460
Leanne.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.464
I don't know.

16:05.591 --> 16:06.592
Feels…

16:10.470 --> 16:11.930
I can't quite explain it.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.481
What the fuck?

16:21.565 --> 16:24.401
I came as soon as you called,
but we're dealing with something.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.238
Dorothy, I don't want to freak you out,
but we have bedbugs.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.407
Bedbugs?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.619
Oh, my God! I've been itching all day!

16:33.702 --> 16:34.995
The whole neighborhood's infested.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.997
I mean, they're trying to clean it up,
but it's moving so slow.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.874
They don't know what's happening,
but I'm gonna get you out of here.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.250
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry?

16:40.751 --> 16:42.794
Do you see the situation I'm in?

16:42.878 --> 16:44.546
Well, I could try and move you myself.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.340
- No.
- Come on, let me help you.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.508
If it hurts, I'll stop.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.761
No! I'd rather be bitten by bugs
than have you touch me.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.597
How could you say that?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.766
You left me alone with her.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.019
Dorothy.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.063
Hand me my phone.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.569
Send Kourtney in.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.080
You didn't want one of these cool outfits?

17:20.457 --> 17:21.458
I'll be fine.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.348
What's wrong?

17:37.140 --> 17:38.141
Nothing.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.311
I don't get it.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.983
It doesn't matter
how much I give you, Sean, Dorothy.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.777
You're all still miserable all the time.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.656
It's not as simple as that.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.078
Do you know how horrible it feels
to be taken for granted, Julian?

17:59.538 --> 18:03.792
It's infuriating.
It's like bugs crawling under your skin.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.233
It's time for Dorothy to eliminate.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.485
We were having a private discussion.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.655
Go. Make that call for me.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.240
Will you be okay?

18:36.325 --> 18:37.367
I'll be fine.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.429
You need my help.

19:28.961 --> 19:29.962
Accidents happen.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.760
But I'm always here
to clean up after you, aren't I?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.433
Arms up.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.312
I'll wash these for you.

20:06.707 --> 20:07.833
Fuck.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.877
When are the exterminators coming?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.378
- Three hours.
- Three hours!

20:11.461 --> 20:14.006
I was outbid. Our neighbors paid triple.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.259
There's six trucks out there.
One of them is gonna help.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.468
- I'll go!
- Hold--

20:27.936 --> 20:29.188
Excuse me.

20:30.606 --> 20:31.607
Excuse me.

20:35.611 --> 20:38.197
- Hey!
- Hey, man.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.241
I've been on the phone
to every goddamn bug company in this city,

20:41.325 --> 20:42.993
and I live right goddamn there.

20:43.744 --> 20:47.998
Clearly, there's idle bodies, so if you
could just find someone to help us out,

20:48.081 --> 20:49.791
I'd be the happiest fucking man alive.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.418
Yeah, I don't make the rules, bro.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.588
Well, can you find someone who does?

20:59.468 --> 21:00.469
Brb.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.846
- Fantastic, isn't it?
- God.

21:03.972 --> 21:07.392
Her gifts grow every day.
You must be in awe.

21:08.727 --> 21:09.728
What are you talking about?

21:10.854 --> 21:14.775
She did this to protect us
from those who wish to do us harm.

21:15.651 --> 21:18.779
Don't you see? There's a war afoot.

21:19.488 --> 21:22.199
She's shielding us. Shielding your family.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.452
God, you people are something else.

21:25.536 --> 21:26.453
Sorry to break it to you,

21:26.537 --> 21:29.915
but I think this is more of an issue of
hygiene and negligence, not voodoo.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.752
You can feel it, can't you?
When you're close to her.

21:33.836 --> 21:38.173
There is something that pulls you in,
tells you that she is the way.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.050
It's her power.

21:50.686 --> 21:51.687
You're still here?

21:52.312 --> 21:56.358
Yeah, they told me to wait
until the exterminators left.

21:56.859 --> 21:59.736
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for you to get trapped here.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.655
You didn't do anything.

22:05.033 --> 22:08.662
My <i>abuela </i>made me this mole
every time I had a bad day.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.333
Like when I didn't make the soccer team
or the basketball team.

22:14.418 --> 22:15.961
Let's just say she made it a lot.

22:16.461 --> 22:20.465
I figured everyone could use
a little comfort food today.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.552
You made this for me?

22:24.094 --> 22:25.095
Uh-huh.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.100
Yeah?

22:30.726 --> 22:31.977
This is nice.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.061
Okay.

22:47.910 --> 22:48.911
Who is it?

22:54.208 --> 22:55.209
Oh, God.

22:57.377 --> 23:01.673
I'll eat as many bites as you want.
Just let me see my son.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.473
You used to like me.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.394
We danced.

23:15.938 --> 23:17.731
We'd plant flowers.

23:19.024 --> 23:20.567
We'd tell secrets.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.072
Girl time, do you remember?

23:28.492 --> 23:30.160
What happened to that?

23:31.828 --> 23:33.705
I realized what you are.

23:35.791 --> 23:36.792
What am I?

23:39.461 --> 23:40.462
You're evil.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.098
Do you want to hear a secret, Dorothy?

23:53.642 --> 23:56.687
I'm starting to realize things
about the people around you.

23:58.105 --> 24:02.568
Sean, Julian, they love you very much.

24:04.736 --> 24:10.450
But you know what I think, that even more
than that, they're afraid of me.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.790
Used to bother me,
but I'm starting not to mind so much.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.169
In fact, I think that they're so afraid

24:20.961 --> 24:23.130
that they probably
wouldn't step foot inside this room

24:23.213 --> 24:24.590
if they knew I was in here.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.761
Probably not even if you screamed.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.641
Right now, I'm all you've got.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.499
- How many houses were affected?
- What?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.503
How many houses were affected?

25:02.586 --> 25:05.422
I don't know, man. Fifteen?
Twenty? Damn near the whole block.

25:20.771 --> 25:23.482
I don't get it.
I left the GQ interview halfway through,

25:23.565 --> 25:28.070
but now they're demanding that I come back
to do a bigger interview tomorrow.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.613
It's like I can't do wrong.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.448
- That's great, Chef.
- There, darling.

25:31.532 --> 25:34.368
My skin is on fire, Frank.
Get me out of this house!

26:14.700 --> 26:15.701
Dorothy?

26:19.037 --> 26:19.872
Leanne.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.458
Who are they?

26:24.459 --> 26:27.296
They're the live-in nurses
that I've hired to help me.

26:27.921 --> 26:31.258
Kourtney and I have been
researching options all day.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.468
What? Why?

26:36.180 --> 26:37.347
I think you know why.

26:40.309 --> 26:41.310
You can go now.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.648
You're not going to win this battle,
Leanne.

26:52.571 --> 26:54.823
I'm trying very hard not to get angry.
