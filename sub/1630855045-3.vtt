WEBVTT

00:01.876 --> 00:05.088
- Hey, yo! Back up, gimme some space.
- Hey, calm down. Don't mess up my fit.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.464
Why you getting fitted anyway?

00:06.464 --> 00:08.425
We waited three years
for the Harlem Renaissance dance,

00:08.425 --> 00:09.968
and you can't even go.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.137
You know?
I actually had an itinerary planned.

00:12.262 --> 00:16.391
7:00 p.m., we strut in.
7:10, drop a verse at the literary salon.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.602
7:45, we go up. You broke that plan.

00:19.769 --> 00:23.356
- Nothing that can't be fixed.
- Fixed? What, you expect to fix Mom?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.567
Yo, you still haven't turned
in that assignment,

00:25.567 --> 00:27.902
- which was one paragraph.
- I started it.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.362
Well, you should have finished it.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.240
Yo, the crew was about
to do it big together.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.827
'Cause next year...
...gonna be a whole new game.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.537
- You and the crew, huh?
- Yeah.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.456
First of all,
Vondie's boo'd up with Angela.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.374
- So good luck getting in between them.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.418
And second,
you should have invited Maya, yo.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.462
You're the one missing out. Besides,

00:45.628 --> 00:47.839
- nothing is keeping me from Alexis.
- Oh, really?

00:48.006 --> 00:50.884
Well, you must have a doppelgÃ¤nger
because have you met our mom?

00:51.092 --> 00:53.261
Yeah, before you. I'm older remember?

00:53.386 --> 00:55.805
- By four minutes.
- And in that time, I learned a lot.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.309
Hey, don't trip, aight?
It's gonna work out, Filth.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.061
Tie me up.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.188
Oh, oh you didn't learn
how to tie your tie?

01:03.605 --> 01:06.191
- Nah. Not in four minutes.
-  You know, whatever, all right?

01:18.578 --> 01:20.246
Babe, your nose.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.041
Hmm.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.961
It's my sinuses, probably.

01:28.671 --> 01:29.714
Mm.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.176
- How do I look?

01:33.176 --> 01:36.679
You sure are colorful.
Handsome, but colorful.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.849
- Can you help me?
- I clean up nice, right?

01:40.558 --> 01:44.646
- Well, a lot nicer than our first date.
- That wasn't a date. I was 12.

01:44.854 --> 01:48.066
- And ashy.
- And you loved these ashy lips.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.818
- Did I?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.367
- So how you feeling?
- I'm nervous.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.911
So much is riding on tonight.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.124
We got a flash flood warning. You know,
I probably should just cancel the dance,

02:04.124 --> 02:08.002
but Basil invited alums
so I can beg for money.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.212
- Now, I...
- Yeah.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.047
...I can't even find my favorite earrings.

02:11.047 --> 02:15.677
I got you, babe. Whatever you need,
DJ Chuck Da Man is your right hand.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.805
-  Mm.
- I can't wait to spin some hits.

02:20.181 --> 02:23.143
If you spin anything,
those kids are gonna run out of the gym

02:23.309 --> 02:26.271
and never talk to us again.
You got my playlist, right?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.106
 No, I got my playlist.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.529
- Did you hear back from your doctor?
- Mm-hmm, it's all good, baby.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.495
And tonight, it's going to be even better.

02:45.874 --> 02:50.628
Yeah. So you got the look
that turns every page in my book.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.463
- You're on fire tonight.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.340
And the way your butter melts,

02:54.340 --> 02:57.177
gonna charm all the cheese
off those donors.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.929
Filthy'd be proud.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.349
Yeah. Where you think he get it from?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.947
Ooh! Mm.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.158
Zora Neale Hurston would call them

03:20.158 --> 03:22.911
- some righteous rags.
- Thank you very much.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.621
- Handsome.
- As in impeccable.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.624
Mm-hmm.
- As in, flawlessly dipped?

03:27.624 --> 03:32.128
And why are you flawlessly dipped, JB?
Because I told you no paper, no dance.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.130
Now, I know you're struggling,
but rules are rules.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.341
- You don't just get to...
- I did it. I turned it in.

03:38.968 --> 03:42.597
- Fantastic. See, I know you hate it...

03:42.764 --> 03:46.517
...but going back on your medication
is gonna do wonders JB, 'kay?

03:47.685 --> 03:52.023
Well, I guess someone can
Lindy Hop with me, hmm?

03:52.148 --> 03:55.151
- I got you, Mom. Oh.
-  Yeah.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.030
See ya.
- See you.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.199
Looking smooth.

04:01.866 --> 04:05.119
- Come on, y'all ready?
- Dad, I love you. But respectfully,

04:05.119 --> 04:06.871
there's no way we're riding with y'all.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.498
It's already bad enough
y'all gonna be there.

04:08.831 --> 04:12.752
- What? The man ain't the man no more?
- Is the man cool? Is my question.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.297
- Yeah, he thinks he is.
Hmm.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.134
The man is cooler
than the polar bear's toenails.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.844
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.013
All right.
- Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.890
Move out my way.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.892
What?
- 'Scuse me.

04:30.853 --> 04:31.938
Look, something's going on.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.357
Dad's sick or something.
But I don't know exactly.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.610
Sick? Yo, didn't Mom just say
his blood pressure was high?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.404
Maybe, but I feel
like it's more than that.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.156
Granny got the same thing,
and she takes a pill and keeps it moving.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.534
- I'm worried, man.
- Relax, bro.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.662
Yo, you're the one
who's always saying Dad will be fine.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.164
- So he will be.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.584
Did you really do that paper?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.421
I uploaded a blank document.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.339
- Oh, my God.
- Yo, by the time anyone checks,

04:58.339 --> 05:00.758
I'll have already written it.
I can even do it later tonight.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.802
- Nobody's gonna know.
- Mom's gonna know.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.681
- You're playing with fire.
- And I might get burned, but not tonight.

05:06.681 --> 05:11.644
Tonight, we turn up. Come on, man.
Together, me and you. Like Kobe and Shaq.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.480
- Nah, like Spike and Denzel.
- Mm.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.025
<i>- Mo' Better,</i> baby.
- You mean <i>X.</i>

05:17.608 --> 05:19.068
- Both.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.370
Stop. Hat. And go.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.343
Hey, yo, I'll see you inside.

05:44.719 --> 05:45.720
Yo.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.556
Awesome.

05:52.602 --> 05:57.190
The night is beautiful.
So the faces of my people.

05:58.649 --> 06:05.448
The stars are beautiful.
So the eyes of my people.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.952
Watch us shine

06:10.286 --> 06:12.789
on some sleek Black boy afterglow.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.041
I hope you got your tickets

06:15.041 --> 06:16.959
'cause we're about to put on a show.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.689
Josh Bell is my name,
but Filthy McNasty is my claim to fame.

06:38.689 --> 06:43.277
I play to win. Like all the greats.
Tonight is the night we celebrate.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.571
Beautiful also is the son.

06:45.738 --> 06:49.492
Sleek Black boy
at the cabaret tomorrow, who knows?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.662
That's why I say, "Dance today."

06:52.662 --> 06:54.205
Yeah.
All right.

07:22.150 --> 07:26.404
As you know, the Harlem Renaissance
is an integral part of Hughes's identity.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.198
That pivotal moment
where art and expression gave birth

07:29.198 --> 07:30.700
to a new form of Black joy.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.744
Well our kids,
they strive to embody that spirit.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.247
Well, they succeeded.
I mean, this is great.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.292
Basil Guidry! Looking sharp, my boy.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.378
All right. I see they let the poker king
in the building. Lamont!

07:42.378 --> 07:44.630
- Hey, thanks for braving the storm.
- What's happening, baby?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.966
What's happening is you took my money
out on the poker table,

07:47.091 --> 07:48.176
and then you brought me in here

07:48.301 --> 07:49.844
- to take some more of my cash.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.721
- You sure that was me?
- That's that Basil hustle, baby.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.725
But seriously,
Dr. Bell and I are thrilled to host you.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.811
I'm sure I don't have to remind you
how special of a place Hughes is.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.273
Yeah, and with the budget cuts,
schools are left to fend for themselves.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.651
So, we will need to lean
on the benevolence of our benefactors.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.236
Well, I'm happy to help.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.739
Well, we have a couple of new additions.
I'd love to take you on a tour...

08:09.739 --> 08:11.699
Hey, why don't I?
I'm sure you have your hands full,

08:11.699 --> 08:12.909
Dr. Bell, right?

08:13.367 --> 08:15.536
Right this way, Lamont.
How your mama now?

08:15.536 --> 08:16.746
Oh, she doing good.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.177
Is that my boy Big V
in the house?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.970
- What's up?
What up, Filthy? How you doing?

08:33.095 --> 08:35.097
- You know Angela, right?
- Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.766
And this is Paul, my other date.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.686
- I thought you and Vondie were dating.
- What are labels?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.813
We just are. Like me and Paul.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.732
- I just am.
- I'm not.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.735
Uh, you guys wanna take a picture?

08:47.735 --> 08:49.529
- Yeah, sure.
- No, no, no, no. Let's go dance.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.022
- Hey.
- Maya, you look...

09:25.648 --> 09:26.857
Fine, doesn't she?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.944
- What's up, Filthy?
- How did you get here?

09:30.069 --> 09:32.113
- I invited him.
- What? Why?

09:32.113 --> 09:35.324
This is our crew's night.
Our finale. He's not a part of that.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.659
- Our crew?
- Yeah.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.245
Are you even listening to yourself?
You don't run the world, Filthy.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.580
You don't even run your own life.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.624
And, uh, don't think I forgot
about that unfinished business.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.002
After you.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.635
Okay, guys. Heads up.

10:15.906 --> 10:16.949
Mm-hmm.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.455
What y'all doing in here?
- What it look like? We talking about NFTs.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.914
Non-fungible tokens, bro.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.668
What's up, Reading Rainbow? Tell me,
what's the definition of this room?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.505
Yo, why y'all drinking in here?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.215
Aren't y'all afraid
somebody's gonna come?

10:33.215 --> 10:35.843
You ask a lot of questions.
Sure you ain't narcing for mom?

10:36.010 --> 10:38.554
Absolutely not. I'm cool.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.557
Yeah, okay. Where's your brother?
Y'all usually attached at the hip.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.602
Um...

10:51.233 --> 10:52.735
JB, where are you taking me?

10:53.361 --> 10:57.073
Patience is a virtue, aight?
Just please keep singing.

10:57.657 --> 11:03.496
<i>Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky</i>

11:04.538 --> 11:06.707
<i>Stormy weather</i>

11:08.626 --> 11:09.835
You're my favorite thing.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.172
- This moment is the best.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.342
Oh, just the moment?
Is that all you want from me?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.720
- Since you asked.
-  I can't with you, JB.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.014
Except, I also can't stop with you.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.517
For real? I was worried.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.602
About me?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.022
'Bout us.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.317
I didn't mean to dump all my problems
on you like that.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.528
- It was too much.
- I'm here for it.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.781
Look, you don't have to worry.
I'm a safe space.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.117
You are.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.994
There's something I wanna show you.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.590
- Hey, watch your step.

11:57.675 --> 12:01.220
All right, okay. Don't panic.
You know the drill.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.640
Apparently, the storm
has knocked out our electricity,

12:04.640 --> 12:08.018
but emergency lights have come on.
Faculty members, please,

12:08.144 --> 12:10.146
let's gather all the students
inside the gym

12:10.146 --> 12:12.523
and make sure everyone is safe
and accounted for

12:12.523 --> 12:15.609
- and report back to me, okay? All right?
Okay.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.821
I'mma check the generator.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.490
Chuck, you look like you need to sit down.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.784
'Scuse me. This is not a good look
for the alum donors.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.910
Do you ever stop?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.912
Basil, can you see
if there's someplace more comfortable

12:26.912 --> 12:28.289
- for them, please?
- Like where?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.416
Do you want me
to book 'em a room on the third floor?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.834
If there's availability.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.671
What's your problem, bro?
Basil, your boss is asking for your help.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.756
No problem at all.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.508
Actually, I'mma take 'em somewhere classy
with some more light.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.470
See if I can salvage this evening
and get that money. Hmm.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.554
Night, Basil.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.640
Evening, y'all.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.393
- Hey.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.729
- I'm checking the backup power.
- No, we got that.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.731
You meet me in study hall.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.161
Yo, you ever need something-something,
I'm your dude, my dude.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.954
Well, now that you mention it,

13:09.163 --> 13:10.956
I was wondering
do you guys have anywhere else to be?

13:11.081 --> 13:13.709
- Nah, man, we entrepreneurs.
We make our own schedule.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.754
Cool. Well, in that case,
can I cop the speaker?

13:17.421 --> 13:20.925
- Why? What you thinking?
- Well, I'm thinking the party ain't over.

13:21.133 --> 13:25.221
- Whoo! Okay, yeah. Yeah!
- Whoa! All right!

13:25.429 --> 13:26.972
So, we need a new generator.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.974
Add it to the list.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.602
Just wanted one night
to be special for the kids.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.937
Is that too much to ask?

13:33.062 --> 13:35.648
- Please. You can't control the weather.
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.359
- And what's going on with Basil?
- What do you mean?

13:38.359 --> 13:42.112
I know kissing butt is his forte,
but he just seems extra smarmy tonight.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.949
He can't help it.
He's got high opinions of himself.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.785
Or his opinion
is that he should be principal.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.789
- I don't know. Maybe he's right.
- I know you didn't just say that.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.834
We're not gonna have a pity party, sis.
We just gotta turn the dance around.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.253
Well, I don't know.
Something is going on with Chuck, too.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.338
I can feel it, something is not right.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.298
- Is he sick?
You know Chuck.

14:01.423 --> 14:05.261
I'd be a fool to wait for him to tell me.
And you know that is something I'm not.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.639
- Mm-hmm. I got the kids.
- Ah. Wish me luck.

14:08.764 --> 14:12.268
I found a way to turn the party back up.
So, what's up, man, you okay?

14:13.644 --> 14:15.020
- No.
- Paul, huh?

14:15.229 --> 14:18.941
She said she was bringing a friend.
Why'd she invite him? That's just foul.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.944
I've treated her like a Disney queen
since sixth grade.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.071
- And this is how she treats me?
- I get it.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.783
- Me personally, I wouldn't let that slide.
- Man, that ain't right.

14:27.908 --> 14:33.247
But what if she brought Paul
as a sort of test for you, you know?

14:33.497 --> 14:36.166
An opportunity for you
to prove yourself to her.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.918
You gotta go hard in the paint.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.672
- You think that's what she means?
- All you gotta do is learn her language.

14:41.964 --> 14:42.965
Love language.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.093
- How do I do that?
- I have no idea.

14:46.552 --> 14:51.640
But, as long as you're still in the game,
you still have a chance.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.520
I... I really don't know
what you just said.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.022
But thanks, Filthy.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.942
- Hey, you know where JB is?
- I saw him slip away with Alexis.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.695
I wonder if that player is able
to think about anything else.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.405
-  Yeah.
I'll see you, bro.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.076
- Hey, man, that sounded good to me.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.913
Thanks, man.
Look, I'll see you guys later.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.581
See you later, man.
- See you, man.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.251
Maybe we should go back
to the gym.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.378
But we're already here.

15:23.756 --> 15:28.135
I didn't know you took art.
- I don't. Mr. Epps is cool.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.471
He lets me come by after school and hang.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.973
It's one of my favorite places.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.604
What's going on, JB?

15:40.397 --> 15:43.108
Me and Filthy,
we've always had these goals.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.278
Our whole life is mapped out.
He's so sure of it.

15:46.737 --> 15:50.282
And what about you? Y'all are twins,
and you have the same genes,

15:50.282 --> 15:52.409
but you can have different dreams.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.206
My mom put me back on my meds.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.000
I hate it, but without it,
it feels like I'm drowning.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.754
And my dad...

16:04.964 --> 16:07.007
Filthy swears something's going on
with him, but...

16:08.092 --> 16:09.093
I don't know.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.470
There's not a lot of things
that keep me grounded.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.182
You're one of them, and the other...

16:16.433 --> 16:17.434
is art.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.188
It's like music on a canvas.
Lyrical therapy.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.023
There's no storm in my head
when I'm painting.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.026
- I never knew.
- I never told anyone

16:26.694 --> 16:30.322
or shown anyone. Not even Filthy, but...

16:43.877 --> 16:47.631
<i>Maybe Vondie was right.
JB's head was into Alexis</i>

16:47.631 --> 16:49.425
<i>and he wasn't thinking
of anything else.</i>

16:51.885 --> 16:54.638
<i>JB might've been willing
to take punishment for his lie,</i>

16:55.305 --> 16:56.306
<i>but I wasn't.</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:01.979
When did you have time to do this?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.732
I know it's not great,
but I've been working on it for a while.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.026
Yeah, it's not that great.

17:08.485 --> 17:12.823
What? Are you serious?
No, it's so dope, JB. Tell me about it.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.242
Um. Okay.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.413
See, he's on this never-ending search
for his other wing.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.497
And because of that,

17:20.497 --> 17:22.583
the thing he wants the most
is just out of his reach.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.627
If he finds it,
it'll feel less like he's falling,

17:25.627 --> 17:28.297
- and more like he can fly.
- Like you, huh?

17:29.423 --> 17:31.467
And what's the thing you want most?

17:32.509 --> 17:36.638
I don't know yet.
Something bigger, bolder.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.516
Something you're passionate about?

17:59.495 --> 18:03.624
Yo. I know how to start my essay.
It just came to me.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.877
- In a flash of lightning? Okay.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.089
What? What is it?

18:12.966 --> 18:14.218
Filthy did my assignment.

18:25.479 --> 18:29.817
- Dr. Bell. So why did I get detention?
- Tell me what's going on.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.032
Come sit down.

18:39.159 --> 18:43.163
Between the high blood pressure
and the diabetes...

18:43.163 --> 18:44.248
I knew it.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.086
That nosebleed was not your sinuses.
What is going on, Chuck?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.379
Doctor...

18:51.296 --> 18:52.714
Hong said that I am...

18:54.466 --> 18:55.843
at risk for...

18:58.178 --> 18:59.263
renal failure.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.890
- What does that mean?
It means that I need a...

19:02.724 --> 19:05.227
...a kidney transplant.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.523
- A transplant?
- I know it's a lot.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.526
How long have you known?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.863
- Couple of weeks.
- And you didn't tell me?

19:16.238 --> 19:19.491
You're not gonna ignore this.
We are raising two boys in this world.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.076
They need their father.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.121
I need their father to be here for them,
and I need my husband to be here for me.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.789
Yeah, I know it's, it's...

19:25.914 --> 19:28.083
- it's a lot now. I know...
- I'm your wife, Chuck.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.628
If you're not confiding in me,
then what do we...

19:32.838 --> 19:34.548
We're gonna get through this.
We got a big village,

19:34.548 --> 19:37.676
We're just gonna ask our family
and friends to test for a kidney match.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.722
- We gotta tell the boys.
- No, babe, I can't.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.849
What do you think they're gonna
do if they find out one day

19:43.849 --> 19:45.434
that they could've saved
their father's life?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.935
That's why I don't want them to know.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.606
I don't even wanna speak of my boys
taking a risk for me. Not today, not ever.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.357
- I never said today, Chuck.
What, babe?

19:52.482 --> 19:56.069
I'm talking about never. I'm serious.
I, I... I don't care. This is my life.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.864
It is not just your life, Chuck.
We are a team!

19:59.948 --> 20:02.951
This is our life. We are not giving up.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.914
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- We are not giving up, Chuck.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.666
Vondie, just let things unfold.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.001
Just be.
Come on.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.505
Yo, V, what's up? What was that?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.424
She said I'm supposed
to let things unfold.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.510
- What does that mean?
- Yo, you wrote my paper? Why?

20:20.636 --> 20:21.762
Look, I was helping you.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.639
You were nowhere close
to finishing that paper.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.557
- Mom was gonna cook you.
- Then let her.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.017
Man, I'm sick of you controlling my life.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.686
Come on, JB. There's a time
and a place. This isn't it.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.772
Yo, tell Josh that. Not me.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.400
Look, she don't need to tell Josh nothing.
Yo, you ruining my night, man.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.986
- You all are.
- Nobody cares about your night, bro.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.864
Obviously, you don't.
Running off with her and all.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.159
Maya bringing stupid Zoom.
I mean, what kind of friend does that?

20:44.159 --> 20:46.286
- Filthy, what is going on?
Oh, nothing.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.706
I'm just pointing out the simple fact
that Vondie is stuck in the multiverse.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.166
My brother left me.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.669
And one of my closest friends
is boo'd up with a complete idiot.

20:53.877 --> 20:54.878
Josh.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.923
She is not boo'd up with him.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.133
I'm the one who told her
you all used to be close.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.843
So I kinda gave her the idea.

21:01.843 --> 21:02.928
So what, you trying to ruin

21:02.928 --> 21:04.972
- my night, too?
- Hey, take the bass out your voice.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.516
- Stop talking to my mom like that, bro.
- Yo, that's my mom, too.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.184
And to be honest,
I think it's probably better

21:09.309 --> 21:11.478
you don't like basketball anymore
'cause you weren't very good.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.438
- Filthy, that's enough.
- I'm better than you ever were.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.441
- In your dreams.
- In my life. Any day, any time.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.651
Any day, any time, huh?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.696
How about today?
Matter of fact, how about now?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.281
Careful what you ask for, little bro.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.033
This'll definitely mess up
some of your little plans.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.746
<i>Squall. Noun.</i>

21:30.038 --> 21:32.499
<i>As in a sudden disturbance
or commotion.</i>

21:32.874 --> 21:37.087
<i>Often a violent storm accompanied
by strong winds, thunder, and lightning.</i>

21:37.087 --> 21:38.213
<i>As in...</i>

21:38.338 --> 21:43.135
The storm outside is nothing compared
to the squall I'm about to bring in here.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.388
Your words ain't gonna
save you here, Filthy.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.515
Oh, yeah? We gonna see about that.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.477
- Check ball.
All right, let's go, boys.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.562
Let's go, JB!

22:01.403 --> 22:05.282
Yeah!

22:08.702 --> 22:09.786
Nice shot!

22:20.547 --> 22:21.548
Come on!

22:24.176 --> 22:26.887
Let's go, JB! Nice, defense, defense.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.812
- Game point.
- Don't choke.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.191
Come on, JB, you got it.
All right, JB! Come on.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.360
Killin' it, JB!

22:42.778 --> 22:43.987
Come on, JB!

22:49.326 --> 22:51.036
<i>Basketball
rule number three.</i>

22:51.328 --> 22:53.747
<i>Sometimes you win even when you lose</i>

22:53.914 --> 22:56.917
<i>because you learn what
it's gonna take to come out on top.</i>

22:57.542 --> 22:58.543
Hey!

23:04.049 --> 23:06.843
That's what type of energy we need
if we're going to win the playoffs, man.

23:06.843 --> 23:10.263
- Come here, man.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.683
Thanks, Filthy. Good game.
- Hey, last dance.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.310
Okay.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.027
- Night didn't go as planned, huh?
- No. No, it did not.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.320
And that's for sure.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.034
That's a... it's nice.
I mean, your necklace is.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.412
Oh.
- Uh, I mean... But no, you look nice.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.748
Thanks. I wear it every day,
but it's... it's cool. Yeah.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.418
- But my mom got it for me, so thank you.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.921
Still catching Ls, huh, Fil?

23:44.297 --> 23:45.298
Look, I don't wanna fight you.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.093
Why would I fight you?
That wouldn't be a contest.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.637
Look, let's just keep it
on the court, okay?

23:51.638 --> 23:52.639
Rivals?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.017
Come on, Zuma. Like, at least he's trying.

23:56.184 --> 24:00.021
- Every great baller needs a nemesis.
- And every great story needs a superhero.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.483
And that's just what I am.
I got wings, Zuma.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.903
- You ain't seen nothing yet.
- Oh. I've seen them.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.576
I know. I'm sorry. I'll see you tomorrow.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.585
I kinda like dancing in the dark.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.720
Hey.
Hey.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.222
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.307
Hey, hey, hey.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.434
- Hey to Beignets.
- Yes, sir. Hey, I got a question.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.936
Can I look at something online real quick?
My phone's dead.

24:39.936 --> 24:43.607
- Sure. Just be careful. It's my dad's.
- All right. Appreciate you, man.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.154
What's this?
Coach giving a speech or something?

24:50.572 --> 24:51.573
Uh-oh.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.161
<i>What's up, JB? What's up, Filthy?</i>

24:56.495 --> 25:00.040
Nope. Not another coaching rant,
all right? It's my day off.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.583
Cool out.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.211
<i>Jordan and Josh.</i>

25:05.712 --> 25:09.549
<i>- My twin flames, I love you so much.</i>

25:10.926 --> 25:14.221
<i>If you're seeing this, that means
something has gone terribly wrong.</i>

25:15.639 --> 25:18.642
<i>My dad, he never got a chance
to say goodbye.</i>

25:20.852 --> 25:24.189
<i>I went to the doctor's,
and the news wasn't that good.</i>

25:27.984 --> 25:29.319
I knew something was wrong.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.114
What do you mean
you knew something was wrong?

25:33.448 --> 25:35.784
Why didn't you tell me, man?
What's going on? What is he talking about?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.661
Man, you wouldn't listen.
I tried to tell you,

25:37.786 --> 25:40.747
but you were so obsessed
with seeing Alexis at the dance.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.919
<i>So I need to leave something
for you just in case.</i>

25:49.548 --> 25:53.009
 <i>The basketball rules of life.</i>

25:54.553 --> 25:58.557
<i>Rule number one.
The ball, that's your heart.</i>

26:00.350 --> 26:01.935
<i>And family is the court.</i>

26:03.853 --> 26:07.148
<i>A loss is inevitable
like snow in the winter,</i>

26:07.482 --> 26:11.361
<i>but as the seasons go,
the cold is always followed by spring.</i>

26:18.201 --> 26:20.287
- Lakers, baby.
Lakers, baby.

26:20.495 --> 26:25.083
<i>Kindred, as in family,
homefolk, crew.</i>

26:25.834 --> 26:26.918
<i>That's what we were.</i>

26:27.711 --> 26:29.504
<i>- Still tight through all the fears.</i>

26:29.504 --> 26:31.047
Maya the Defiant.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.717
<i>Clutched tight
after all these years.</i>

26:36.011 --> 26:37.804
Yeah!
Vondie!

26:39.931 --> 26:44.519
<i>True champions learn
to dance through the storm. We had wings.</i>

26:44.519 --> 26:45.770
NBA, man, we did it.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.315
<i>So high,
nothing could stop us from winning.</i>

26:48.481 --> 26:50.150
I feel like I can fly.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.111
I swear we can make it
from here to the pool.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.487
- No!
<i>We knew the seasons</i>

26:54.487 --> 26:56.072
<i>- would change.</i>
- I don't... yo, I don't wanna...

26:56.197 --> 26:58.116
<i>We just didn't know
it would happen so soon.</i>

26:58.116 --> 26:59.409
Two, one...
