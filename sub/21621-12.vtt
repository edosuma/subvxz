WEBVTT

00:08.609 --> 00:11.178
Can you turn it up?
I like the song. I know that girl.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.877
Thanks for giving me
a ride to the airport, guys.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.378
-Of course.
-No problem.

01:18.445 --> 01:23.884
I mean, I could've Ubered it, but, like,
this is the best experience ever.

01:23.951 --> 01:24.985
Who would've thought?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.821
We're all so busy that the only way
we get to see each other

01:27.888 --> 01:29.957
is if we drive each other to the airport.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.391
That's true.

01:31.458 --> 01:35.262
Will, do you still, like, write music
and record music and do music,

01:35.329 --> 01:36.897
or are you focused mostly on...

01:36.964 --> 01:38.398
-Business?
-Your business?

01:38.465 --> 01:43.136
I used to write at least 20 songs
a month.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.204
Wow.

01:44.271 --> 01:49.243
But now that 15 to 20 has been
dwindled down to three.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.112
-Do you miss it?
-I miss touring with the group.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.714
That's what I miss the most, like...

01:53.780 --> 01:55.682
-Do you miss acting?
-No.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.652
-I can't believe I'm in the car with you.
-Oh, please.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.754
With my, like, BO
coming out of my overcoat?

02:00.821 --> 02:02.523
You know why?
Because our company's building

02:02.589 --> 02:04.458
-something that's like J.A.R.V.I.S.
-Really?

02:04.525 --> 02:06.860
And somebody called me,
like, Black Tony Stark.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.395
-That's a good analogy.
-That is a good analogy.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.365
-Real s***.
-That's good.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.368
And then I'm like, "I guess it's true
because, like, I'm rocking with Gwyneth".

02:14.434 --> 02:16.703
Because Pepper Potts
is driving you right now.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.938
I love Pepper.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.074
Pepper Potts is driving
your late ass to the airport.

03:45.726 --> 03:51.532
I wish we were going to, like, Coachella
or something instead of the airport.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.600
-Did you used to go to raves?
-Raves?

03:53.667 --> 03:58.205
I used to come out to Melrose
and then we would learn on Melrose

03:58.272 --> 04:01.208
where the rave was, because remember
when you had to go to the store,

04:01.275 --> 04:03.644
like, Wasteland or wherever,
and then you had to--

04:03.710 --> 04:05.479
Wasteland, you remember that s***?

04:05.546 --> 04:09.383
Yeah. And you would go to the store
that would say, "Go here".

04:09.449 --> 04:12.119
Oh, yes. This is before the Internet.

04:12.186 --> 04:14.154
Yeah. We would have
to go to the store...

04:14.221 --> 04:16.790
-Find your own adventure.
-...at like ten o'clock at night

04:16.857 --> 04:19.259
and they told you
where the rave was gonna be.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.795
-Wow.
-And it was some random ass warehouse

04:21.862 --> 04:23.130
in the middle of zero.

04:23.197 --> 04:25.732
It was the best.
This is before cell phones.

04:25.799 --> 04:29.169
How did I miss this?
Can we rave in the car right now?

04:29.236 --> 04:30.637
Yeah, let's rave in the car.

05:22.422 --> 05:25.926
All right, Jessica. The name of
your company is the Honest Company.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.061
-Yes.
-And now we're gonna play a game

05:28.095 --> 05:30.063
called Truth or Truth.

05:31.265 --> 05:34.067
Kind of like Truth or Dare
but no dare, just Truth or Truth.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.370
In a moving vehicle,
dares are compromised.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.071
-Yeah.
-Okay. So here we go.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.073
-Truth or truth. Jessica.
-Yes.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.376
Do you own anything from Goop?

05:46.313 --> 05:48.115
-Yes.
-Great.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.349
-Gwyneth.
-Yes.

05:49.416 --> 05:52.386
Have you ever purchased
any Honest Company products?

05:56.423 --> 05:59.993
So many, I have one in my body right now.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.129
-Oh.
-Total truth.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.499
-Wait. Just kidding.
-Don't, don't probe.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.635
-Jessica, do you like a...
-I think I probed.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.037
Jessica...

06:11.839 --> 06:14.608
Jessica, did it bring you
even a little joy

06:14.675 --> 06:17.544
when the Fantastic Four remake bombed?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.747
I just...

06:20.814 --> 06:24.418
I have to say that I really liked
doing the movie and it was really fun.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.822
You know what?
Elegance, class all the way.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.858
-Yeah, b******.
-Gwyneth.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.893
-Yes, sir.
-What actor gave you

06:32.960 --> 06:35.062
your best onscreen kiss?

06:35.128 --> 06:36.163
Oooh!

06:36.797 --> 06:39.066
-Who?
-Ethan Hawke in Great Expectations.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.335
You guys kissed for real?
That's not acting kiss?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.403
-No, you always kiss for real.
-Great kisser.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.206
-For real? You don't pretend kiss?
-You don't pretend kiss.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.642
Oh my gosh, I'm thinking you guys
are pretending kissing.

06:48.709 --> 06:54.481
Do you know who else was a good kisser?
So I did a cameo in Austin Powers 3,

06:54.548 --> 06:58.919
I think, and I made out with Tom Cruise
in the beginning of it.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.554
-Good kisser.
-Really?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.456
-Wait. You guys for real kissed?
-Yeah.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.658
I'm thinking you had
stunt double kiss people.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.226
-You have to kiss.
-Hmm?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.095
-You kiss with the tongue.
-For real?

07:08.161 --> 07:11.365
-You can sort of fake the tongue part...
-Sometimes you don't.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.699
Sometimes you can't.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.102
Have you ever had to drink
before a sex scene?

07:15.169 --> 07:18.839
Yes, I had to once because
I had a real, like, explicit one

07:18.906 --> 07:21.909
with an actor named Johnathon Schaech
in a terrible movie

07:22.042 --> 07:24.378
that I did when,
I don't know, so long ago.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.348
And we had to, like, fully bone,
and I was petrified,

07:28.415 --> 07:32.052
and I drank like a bunch of vodka
before, and then it wasn't so bad.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.488
Really? So those things are real
in the films?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.723
-You're not really boning.
-I know that.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.225
-But you simulate boning.
-Yeah.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.628
The worst is when they make you
simulate climaxing.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.197
It's so uncomfortable.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.101
Oh, my God. The gnarliest
sex scene I ever had to do,

07:48.168 --> 07:51.371
I was totally naked
and I was butt-ass naked.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.974
Oh, so they don't have, like,
naked stunt body doubles?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.410
-They give you a little flesh-coloured...
-Like a merkin...

07:56.476 --> 08:01.381
...weird chonie, but sometimes
they just put it over your non only.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.483
Right? It's just on the...

08:05.485 --> 08:07.354
-Really? Real stuff?
-Oh, my God.

08:07.421 --> 08:10.490
Do you know what Denzel Washington
always says before a sex scene?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.426
-What?
-This is the best thing ever.

08:12.492 --> 08:17.097
He just says to the lady,
"Don't get offended if I do

08:17.164 --> 08:18.899
and don't get offended if I don't".

08:21.134 --> 08:23.337
-What does that mean?
-Get hard.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.873
Oh. Oh!

08:27.875 --> 08:29.142
Oh, my God.

08:29.209 --> 08:33.113
Do you guys know that I did a country
music movie and this song is from it?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.381
We do.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.784
Come on, girl .

08:38.852 --> 08:42.322
Tell me about your cold winters!

08:42.389 --> 08:44.591
Yeah.

08:44.658 --> 08:48.395
Were you dehydrated?

08:48.462 --> 08:50.964
Don't wanna do that, girl.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.835
Punch him in the face.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.171
Guitar solo now.

09:34.141 --> 09:38.278
If I was a guitar player,
I would do, I would do the face.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.752
Okay, will.i.am, here we are.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.754
Thanks for taking me to the airport, guys.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.424
-Were you born in America?
-Yes.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.493
-Okay. Then you're allowed to go.
-All right, thanks.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.828
See you, guys.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.929
-Mwah!
-Thanks, guys.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.898
-We love you.
-Love you guys.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.066
-Bye.
-Be safe.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.501
-Safe flight.
-See you in London.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.902
-I'm gonna miss him.
-Bye-bye.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.904
-Bye.
-Bye, Felicia.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.540
Hello, ladies.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.308
-Hi!
-How are you?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.278
-We're great.
-We're really good that you're here.

10:11.345 --> 10:14.348
I'm very happy to be here.
Where are you going? Can I come?

10:14.414 --> 10:17.351
We're going to a sweat lodge.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.853
-Called Shapehouse.
-Do you wanna detox with us?

10:21.388 --> 10:22.856
What even is a sweat lodge?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.224
Come on, come with us.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.927
You do a lot of this.
I was reading about you.

10:26.994 --> 10:31.098
But me and my wife went to a place
where she steamed her vagina.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.001
-How did she like it?
-Well, yes, she enjoyed it.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.537
-So, basically, it's an old...
-What happens?

10:36.603 --> 10:38.405
It's a thousands of year-old
Korean technique.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.608
And you sit on, like, a little throne
and it's called the V-steam.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.744
It's just... steam just...

10:43.810 --> 10:45.979
But, like, is it like pleasure?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.182
You feel... you feel like...

10:49.116 --> 10:51.218
old lovers leaving your body.

10:51.285 --> 10:54.154
-What does that mean?
-You feel old lovers leaving your body.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.923
My wife didn't say that, but...

10:55.989 --> 10:58.325
That's because she's not had
any lovers but you, James.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.851
S***.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.152
Yeah, it is.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.130
Take it, Gwyneth. Oh, yeah.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.701
Uh-oh.

11:43.971 --> 11:44.972
Yeah!

12:31.952 --> 12:32.953
Oh!

12:33.687 --> 12:35.489
Oh, big tune.

12:35.556 --> 12:38.292
Now, you're both incredibly
successful businesswomen.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.694
When did you both decide to become moguls?

12:41.261 --> 12:45.732
I mean, I started in 2008
with, like, this little newsletter.

12:45.799 --> 12:49.102
It was only a couple years ago
that I tried to make it into a business.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.604
-But it's incredible, Goop.
-Thank you.

12:50.671 --> 12:52.506
And you started with diapers, right?

12:52.573 --> 12:55.843
I started with diapers and wipes
and we've grown from there.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.613
I feel there hasn't been proper growth
in the diaper industry.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.616
Can I show you some diaper prototypes
that I've put together?

13:02.683 --> 13:03.684
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.853
Which I'm looking
for investment for, right?

13:05.919 --> 13:08.422
-What does that mean?
-This diaper, the coffee cup diaper.

13:08.488 --> 13:13.493
So, because if you're holding your baby
and you've got your coffee...

13:13.560 --> 13:16.196
-Right. Where do you...?
-Or tea, where do you use your other hand?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.198
-Yeah, but--
-Hang on a minute. Look, watch.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.068
Hang on. Oh, there we go.
I'm hands-free.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.905
-But you can spill the hot on the baby.
-That's what everybody says.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.274
-I mean, jeez, chill out. Okay.
-No, we shouldn't do that.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.678
What about this one?
It's incredible. The drone diaper.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.914
You know how you lose your baby.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.317
You know, you're like, "Oh, I thought
he was in the playroom, where is he?"

13:37.384 --> 13:40.621
You just call it back on the drone,
delivers it to where you are.

13:41.889 --> 13:42.890
No.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.193
-What about this one, bondage babies?
-Oh, my God.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.794
-Bondage baby.
-That's so f***** up.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.164
Bondage baby. You just... all right.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.967
I don't even know... That's like so weird.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.671
I'll be honest, we put that into a test
group and it didn't come back great.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.842
Okay, guys, are you ready
for a major detox?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.714
An urban sweat lodge,
but you've never done this before?

14:07.781 --> 14:11.151
-Never. Have you done it before?
-No. Who do you think you're talking to?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.153
-Of course I've never done this.
-Hi!

14:13.220 --> 14:15.656
Hello. We're here to have a sweat.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.824
-Let's go change you.
-Okay.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.227
-Let's do it.
-What do we wear here now?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.835
All right, let's get you in bed.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.902
Okay.

14:31.572 --> 14:34.575
-I'm already sweating.
-Jumping in, yup.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.410
Jumping into a hot ass bed.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.779
Oh, my G-- Are you joking?

14:38.846 --> 14:41.715
-It's so hot.
-It's so hot.

14:41.782 --> 14:43.450
-I love it.
-Oh, my God.

14:43.517 --> 14:45.652
This is deeply detoxifying.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.089
If you test sweat
after an infrared sweat...

14:49.089 --> 14:50.290
Yeah.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.459
...you'll find more toxicity in the sweat

14:52.526 --> 14:55.429
after infrared than anything else:
regular sauna, steam...

14:55.495 --> 14:56.830
-Really?
-...exercise, yes.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.666
-So, like, pulls out all the bad stuff.
-Heavy metals,

14:59.733 --> 15:01.668
parasites, anything like that.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.038
Honestly, I think I could outstay
both of you on this.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.509
I mean, I could sleep here,
I feel like, for a year.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.410
No way either of you will beat me.

15:13.647 --> 15:16.049
-I never felt this warm.
-t's hot.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.186
How long have I been in here now,
an hour, two hours?

15:19.253 --> 15:21.655
-Three minutes.
-You're joking.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.390
-No, three minutes.
-Are you serious? Three minutes?

15:23.457 --> 15:25.225
-Yes.
-Oh, my God.

15:42.476 --> 15:44.378
It really actually
is getting quite warm in here.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.158
-Hi, did someone order a pizza?
-I did, yes.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.626
Seriously, you ordered a pizza?

15:59.693 --> 16:02.763
Well, I just figured that my body's gonna
start missing some toxins.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.407
Guys.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.411
You're bailing, you're bailing,
you're an absolute wimp.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.346
-Look here, Paltrow is bailing.
-No.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.748
Is it too warm?

16:21.815 --> 16:24.351
-I swear I thought I'd be first to crush.
-Me too.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.820
F*** detox.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.161
Uhh! It's so hot.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.297
I'm so competitive, I wanna beat you.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.099
But I'm laid down, and I don't know

16:39.166 --> 16:42.269
if I've ever lost
anything that's involved lying down.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.110
You will never beat me.

16:50.811 --> 16:52.779
You're never gonna win.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.585
You honestly think I won't beat you?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.589
What are you doing?

17:02.656 --> 17:04.391
Hang on a minute. That's too warm.

17:04.458 --> 17:08.161
That is too warm now, that's too warm.
That's double warm, you're killing me.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.497
-That's too warm.
-Alba's gonna win.

17:10.564 --> 17:12.633
-Alba's not gonna win.
-Alba's gonna win.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.068
-I'll stay here forever.
-Alba will always win.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.538
-No way.
-Alba will make you die.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.840
You'll make me die? That took a turn.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.145
No way. You're bailing.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.214
Cheers.

17:29.950 --> 17:31.185
I totally won.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.754
I totally won.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.490
Who'd have thought
that I'd be the best at detox?

17:39.326 --> 17:43.363
Guys, you're gonna wait for me, right?
I still need a lift. Guys?

17:43.430 --> 17:46.133
Guys? Paltrow.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.970
Alba. Paltrow.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.638
Alba!
