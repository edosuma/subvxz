Our first
Christmas card photo.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.579
Man,
I was a cute-ass baby.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.914
We watched
"Miracle on 34th Street,"

18:34.947 --> 18:37.784
and you fell asleep on me
listening to "The Nutcracker."

18:37.817 --> 18:39.586
That's why it
makes me so sleepy!

18:39.619 --> 18:41.754
And when you first
saw this angel,

18:41.788 --> 18:44.424
you were laughing
non-stop.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.259
It was the best sound.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.861
It made everything
feel okay.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.364
It still does.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.700
Now I get why you don't want to
change all these traditions.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.269
That, and letting you
make new traditions

18:56.303 --> 18:58.305
means admitting that
you're growing up.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.674
And that is the change
I am really not ready for.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.176
[ Sighs ]

19:03.210 --> 19:06.546
But I guess it's gonna happen
no matter how stubborn I am.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.182
[ Chuckles ]
Sounds to me

19:09.216 --> 19:11.818
like someone's coming around
on Christmas brownies...

19:11.851 --> 19:15.054
Smashy smashy
some canes?
Okay.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.290
But we're not gonna call
them "reindeer patties."

19:17.324 --> 19:18.958
We'll revisit this.
No, we won't.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.960
And the dance begins...

19:20.993 --> 19:23.496
And the dance begins...

19:23.530 --> 19:27.834
**

19:30.203 --> 19:31.638
What's that mess?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.206
Evan:
It's a dog in a top hat,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.141
holding an iron,
riding in a wheelbarrow.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.210
I made it.
That's what Evan got
me for Christmas

19:37.244 --> 19:39.346
so I don't waste any
time picking my piece.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.184
Tennessee Avenue.
Not doing it.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.586
Did you know the oranges
are the most

19:46.619 --> 19:48.521
frequently landed-upon
properties?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.423
I'm not an orange guy.
It washes me out.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.826
The game is Monopoly,
not favorite colors.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.996
**

19:57.029 --> 19:58.831
No! Don't smash us!

19:58.865 --> 20:00.500
Save me!

20:00.533 --> 20:02.935
I have a family!

20:02.969 --> 20:04.170
You wanna try?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.705
I think you'll like it.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.741
Smash!

20:08.775 --> 20:11.911
Feels good, right?
Yes!

20:11.944 --> 20:13.780
Okay, no, calm down.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.715
If you keep that up, you'll
put a hole in the bag.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.718
**

20:22.889 --> 20:24.724
* Sing we joyous all together!

20:24.757 --> 20:26.192
* Fa la la la la...

20:26.225 --> 20:29.028
* ...la la la laaaa

20:29.061 --> 20:30.763
So festive!
So good!

20:30.797 --> 20:32.532
So loud!
So great.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.734
Anyway, the karaoke
machine was my present,

20:34.767 --> 20:36.736
so maybe I can sing
Aerosmith finally?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.871
Nope. We have one more
song this year.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.975
Great, I'll just, um, play with
my new dress socks, then.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.712
* It was December 24th on
Hollis Ave in the dark *

20:45.745 --> 20:48.315
* When I saw a man chilling
with his dog in the park *

20:48.348 --> 20:50.650
* I approached him very slowly
with my heart full of fear *

20:50.683 --> 20:53.453
* Looked at his dog, oh, my God,
an ill reindeer *

20:53.486 --> 20:55.888
* And then I was illin,
'cause the man had a beard *

20:55.922 --> 20:58.425
* And a bag full of goodies,
12 o'clock had neared *

20:58.458 --> 21:00.793
* I turned my head a second,
and the man was gone *

21:00.827 --> 21:03.596
* But he left his driver's
wallet smack dead on the lawn *
