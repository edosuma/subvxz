02:16.403 --> 02:18.539
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Meg?</i>

02:18.573 --> 02:19.941
<i>It's me,</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:21.208
Kathy Madison.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.645
I hope you're awake, girl.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.547
<i>It's almost midday,
for God's sake.</i>

02:26.581 --> 02:27.715
Of course, I'm awake.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.984
Barely, I'd say.

02:30.018 --> 02:32.820
Listen, Meg, I need you
in my office in about an hour.

02:32.854 --> 02:34.187
Can you make that?

02:35.355 --> 02:36.423
Of course.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.491
But why?

02:37.525 --> 02:38.826
What's up?

02:38.860 --> 02:40.360
I'll be waiting.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.395
Don't be long.

Hey, Meg.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.461
Glad you made it.

04:55.096 --> 04:56.864
Hi, Kathy is in there?

04:56.898 --> 04:58.766
- Can I go in?
- One moment, please.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.074
Ms. Madison?

05:07.108 --> 05:09.043
- Meg is here.
- Send her in.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.449
Hi, Kathy.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.489
Isn't that The Words
on the cover there?

05:22.523 --> 05:25.560
Funny, I was just listening
to them.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.029
He was like a god
once upon a time.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.864
A fallen god, I'm afraid.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.166
Well, a rock god, nonetheless.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.769
In fact, The Words
are more popular now

05:34.802 --> 05:36.571
than when Jake Lion was alive.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.774
Do you remember
that article you wrote

05:40.675 --> 05:42.910
about The Words

05:42.944 --> 05:45.980
and all that rock music
from the '70s

05:46.013 --> 05:48.583
when I first took over
the magazine from my father?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.652
Well, I dug it out of the vault.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.155
Wow. That was a long time ago.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.489
My first piece
for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

05:58.526 --> 06:01.829
Are you still into Jake Lion
and The Words?

06:01.863 --> 06:04.065
Like any rock lover should.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.398
You want to meet him?

06:05.900 --> 06:07.201
Are you nuts?

06:07.235 --> 06:09.737
He has been dead
for over 40 years.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.139
Well, that's what they say.

06:13.608 --> 06:15.643
You know, when they
first came to Paris,

06:15.676 --> 06:18.079
my father did a special edition
just on him,

06:18.112 --> 06:19.714
put him on the cover.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.515
Yes, I wasn't born yet.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.483
That was the end of The Words.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.553
Yeah. They tried to replace him,

06:25.586 --> 06:27.555
but it was like putting
someone other than Mick Jagger

06:27.588 --> 06:28.990
to front the Stones.

06:30.625 --> 06:31.792
True.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.928
But the point is, Jake is dead.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.697
He jumped into the Seine
in front of a ton of people.

06:37.832 --> 06:38.833
Really well.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.702
And I never understood why

06:41.736 --> 06:44.171
a rock star like him
would commit suicide.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.141
Rock star vertigo, maybe.

06:50.044 --> 06:51.245
Listen, Meg,

06:51.279 --> 06:54.248
do you know anything
about <i>The Phantom of the Opera?</i>

06:54.282 --> 06:57.084
I know it was
a French boring story

06:57.118 --> 06:59.687
we had to learn in school.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.721
Why?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.456
Well, just think about it.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.893
I have a couple
of important meetings,

07:05.927 --> 07:07.595
but I'll meet you here,

07:09.196 --> 07:10.497
at midnight.

07:11.299 --> 07:12.465
The Class.

07:14.235 --> 07:16.570
What the hell is The Class?

07:16.604 --> 07:18.839
Well, you'll find out

Coming right up.

09:01.175 --> 09:02.576
Are you an actor?

09:04.045 --> 09:05.046
What?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.815
Have you seen me in something?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.117
No, but honestly,

09:10.151 --> 09:13.954
I never knew a bartender
who wasn't an actor.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.757
Do you know
anything about theatre?

09:16.791 --> 09:18.959
I know I've done
a lot of auditions.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.362
So, you know
<i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>

09:21.395 --> 09:23.831
Is it still on Broadway?

09:23.864 --> 09:26.934
Mm. That's one I've never
auditioned for, sorry.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.269
But you know the story.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.938
Let me see.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.175
The Phantom is a guy in a mask

09:34.208 --> 09:36.010
and he lives
in the Paris sewers

09:36.043 --> 09:39.113
when he is not swinging
from Opera chandeliers.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.082
And he is pissed off,

09:41.115 --> 09:43.684
'cause he is a great composer
and he got ripped off.

09:45.286 --> 09:46.287
Or is that <i>Cats?</i>

09:47.321 --> 09:48.622
Uh-huh.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.991
Thanks a lot.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.293
And good luck.

09:52.326 --> 09:53.327
Thanks.

09:57.898 --> 09:58.899
Kathy?

10:00.434 --> 10:01.602
What?

10:03.471 --> 10:04.738
I don't...

10:05.439 --> 10:06.607
Kathy.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.275
Kathy!

10:12.413 --> 10:13.647
Excuse me.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.084
Do you know Plynth the Persian?

10:17.718 --> 10:18.719
Plynth?

10:20.221 --> 10:21.689
That's him right over there.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.024
Hey, Plynth!

10:24.058 --> 10:26.093
Got a lady here
who wants to talk to ya.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.667
Are you Plynth the Persian?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.402
Yeah. What can I do for you?

10:35.436 --> 10:38.005
I just spoke with Kathy Madison
on the phone.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.075
She told me you maybe have
something to tell me?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.743
Oh.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.845
I was talking to her
about Jake Lion.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.848
I was his personal roadie.

10:47.882 --> 10:51.185
Used to help him on stage
when he was too drunk to walk.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.087
And I was with him in The Words

10:53.120 --> 10:54.922
the year he disappeared.

10:54.955 --> 10:55.956
And?

10:57.491 --> 10:58.659
Well,

10:59.193 --> 11:00.427
like I told Kathy,

11:00.895 --> 11:03.097
Jake Lion is alive

11:03.130 --> 11:04.732
and only I know where he is.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.434
That's bullshit.

11:07.468 --> 11:10.871
Jake Lion is dead
for, what, 40 years?

11:11.372 --> 11:12.840
You know, you're cute.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.708
And you're a liar.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.377
I never lie.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.913
Except about the size
of my dick.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.015
So, finally, what's the story?

11:21.782 --> 11:22.783
Well, here it is.

11:23.918 --> 11:26.854
I'm finishing up a European tour
with Vampire Weekend,

11:26.887 --> 11:28.822
and I got a day off in Paris.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.990
<i>I'm on the metro.</i>

11:32.426 --> 11:33.727
Give me a Diet Coke, Rick.

11:35.396 --> 11:37.498
<i>The train pulls into
Pere-Lachaise.</i>

11:37.532 --> 11:40.100
<i>That's the big cemetery.</i>

11:40.134 --> 11:42.436
<i>And I started hearing
Jake Lion's voice.</i>

11:43.404 --> 11:44.405
<i>Loud,</i>

11:45.139 --> 11:46.140
<i>clear,</i>

11:46.807 --> 11:47.908
and live.

11:49.310 --> 11:50.844
And I knew that voice.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.347
<i>It gave me goosebumps.</i>

11:53.380 --> 11:55.249
<i>There was no mistaking it.
It was Jake.</i>

11:55.883 --> 11:57.519
<i>So, you saw a ghost.</i>

11:57.552 --> 11:59.386
<i>Shit like that happens
all the time,</i>

11:59.420 --> 12:01.523
especially when
you are high enough.

12:01.556 --> 12:04.291
I've been sober for 20 years.

12:04.325 --> 12:06.393
And I knew Jake Lion
better than anyone.

12:06.427 --> 12:09.296
But why you didn't
go back to see him?

12:09.330 --> 12:10.965
I did go back the next morning.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.266
Couldn't find him.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.368
Then we left Paris.
I mean, I was on tour.

12:15.970 --> 12:17.972
But maybe it was, I don't know,

12:18.005 --> 12:19.373
someone who wanted to be him

12:19.406 --> 12:22.176
or an imitator.
Or, I don't know...

12:22.209 --> 12:23.777
No way. No way.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.380
I was with Jake Lion
and The Words

12:26.413 --> 12:28.282
until the very end.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.017
Did a three-month tour
around the States

12:30.050 --> 12:31.285
before he split to Paris.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.821
He was planning a new album

12:33.854 --> 12:36.790
and he was writing new songs
like crazy.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.594
And nobody ever heard him sing
those new songs but me.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.263
But, what does
that really prove?

12:43.364 --> 12:44.999
Prove?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.800
He was singing
one of those new songs

12:46.834 --> 12:48.869
when I saw him on the subway.
That's what it proves.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.372
Are you Meg Trudeau,
by any chance?

12:51.405 --> 12:52.773
I am Meg Trudeau.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.341
Why?

12:54.375 --> 12:56.977
Somebody left
something for you earlier.

13:04.485 --> 13:06.387
Tickets for Paris?

13:06.420 --> 13:08.956
Why? I don't want
to go back there.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.025
My God, it's not
my home anymore.

13:12.293 --> 13:13.595

13:51.599 --> 13:54.468
you can bring Jake Lion
back to life.

13:54.502 --> 13:57.171
That would be a good trick.
He's been gone for quite a while.

13:57.806 --> 14:00.107
But how did you meet him?

14:00.140 --> 14:03.110
We met in the early '70s.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.179
We were probably 22 years old.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.081
Two of us were just kids.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.116
He was with
his group, The Words,

14:09.149 --> 14:10.150
and I was

14:10.918 --> 14:12.186
solo act at the time.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.455
But his style was...

14:14.488 --> 14:16.524
Was more like... I think
they signed the two of us

14:16.558 --> 14:18.292
to be new Dylans together
actually, at the time.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.562
That was <i>Everybody's
Looking For Somebody.</i>

14:20.595 --> 14:23.097
And, uh... Around 1972.

14:24.398 --> 14:26.266
And did you play
some music with him?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.334
Not too much.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.269
Jake let me open for him.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.605
I opened for him a few times.

14:30.638 --> 14:32.039
And... Which was pretty nice

14:32.072 --> 14:33.675
because there wasn't
a lot of people letting us

14:33.708 --> 14:35.242
open for 'em in those days.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.678
- Yes.
- And...

14:36.711 --> 14:40.214
But we hung around together
quite a bit and...

14:40.247 --> 14:42.916
I've... Just somebody
I've felt really close to.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.586
You know, I've missed him.

14:44.619 --> 14:46.621
And, what do you remember
about him?

14:46.654 --> 14:47.988
What do you remember?

14:48.021 --> 14:50.491
What can you tell me
about what was he like?

14:51.125 --> 14:53.060
Jake was...

14:53.093 --> 14:56.096
Even back then, I would say,
he was a little more miserable

14:56.130 --> 14:58.432
than most artists, you know?

14:58.465 --> 14:59.701
But he was a sweet guy.

14:59.734 --> 15:01.969
He always had a...
He had a sweet heart.

15:02.436 --> 15:04.037
And,

15:04.071 --> 15:05.673
an incredible lyricist.

15:05.707 --> 15:07.241
And really,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.176
just a great frontman,
you know?

15:09.209 --> 15:11.513
Really though, my wife actually

15:11.546 --> 15:13.347
<i>knew him better than I did.</i>

15:13.380 --> 15:15.683
<i>'Cause she sang...
Before she sang with the E-Street Band,</i>

15:15.717 --> 15:18.285
<i>she sang backup in Jake's band
for quite a while.</i>

15:18.318 --> 15:21.121
But he just disappeared
like that.

15:21.155 --> 15:23.558
That was one of
the strangest things, you know?

15:23.591 --> 15:25.560
Uh, and the strange...

15:25.593 --> 15:27.327
It was just as he was

15:28.563 --> 15:30.598
becoming really successful.

15:30.632 --> 15:31.999
- Mmm.
- You know?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.736
And, I mean,
it's not for everybody,

15:34.769 --> 15:36.738
but he'd done all the hard work.

15:36.771 --> 15:39.339
- Mm-hmm.
- He had already done the hard work.

15:39.373 --> 15:42.176
And, once he got there,
for some reason,

15:42.209 --> 15:43.678
- he slipped off the map, you know?
- Yeah.

15:43.711 --> 15:45.513
And, I heard it was Paris,

15:45.547 --> 15:47.214
and I heard
he jumped off a bridge.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.482
I don't know
what happened to him.

15:48.516 --> 15:50.350
Yeah, it's really strange.

15:52.186 --> 15:54.522
- Hi, Patti. I'm Meg.
- Hi. Hi, Meg.

15:54.556 --> 15:56.724
I work with Kathy Madison.

15:56.758 --> 15:58.392
I have some questions.

15:58.425 --> 16:02.062
Jake Lion disappeared like that.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.766
Yeah. I hadn't seen him
in a long time,

16:04.799 --> 16:06.967
but, um, I heard that he...

16:07.836 --> 16:10.437
Well, he jumped off a bridge
in Paris.

16:10.471 --> 16:13.407
Um, I wasn't singing with him
at the time.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.409
I had left the band, The Words,

16:15.442 --> 16:17.010
way before that.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.246
So you were not there
when he jumped into the river.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.682
No.

16:20.715 --> 16:23.585
And when was the last time
you saw him?

16:23.618 --> 16:26.420
The last time I saw him,
he was happy.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.557
I think it was more of his...

16:29.591 --> 16:30.792
He didn't like
what came along with it.

16:30.825 --> 16:32.794
Like fame. I think fame felt

16:32.827 --> 16:35.797
very disruptive to him,

16:35.830 --> 16:37.599
and made him go really inward.

16:37.632 --> 16:39.801
But, if we were touring
and on the bus with him,

16:39.834 --> 16:42.804
he'd playing and singing
and having the greatest time.

16:42.837 --> 16:44.037
Yes.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.673
But I heard, mm,

16:45.707 --> 16:48.408
and I saw
in an interview of Jake,

16:48.442 --> 16:51.245
and he said it was easier
for him to confront a failure

16:51.278 --> 16:52.747
than to deal with success.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.381
What do you think about that?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.584
- It's...
- It's complicated,

16:56.618 --> 17:00.254
but I... I do think
music was very natural to him

17:00.287 --> 17:03.056
and that was his safe spot.
His own music.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.659
But, doing it in public,

17:04.692 --> 17:08.328
and then, having the public
be part of that equation,

17:08.362 --> 17:09.363
felt...

17:09.396 --> 17:12.065
I think it just never felt
comfortable to him.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.468
He was just never
really comfortable with it.

17:14.502 --> 17:17.571
Whatever the wolf
at the door was for him,

17:17.605 --> 17:21.340
it seemed to exist
when he was with his audience.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.743
- He was just...
- Yeah, right?

17:22.777 --> 17:25.279
He was just more private
than most, you know,

17:25.311 --> 17:26.814
for, considering...

17:26.848 --> 17:29.349
for a job where you're...

17:29.383 --> 17:32.486
putting yourself out in public
on a daily basis.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.890
But why do you think he
could have committed suicide?

17:35.924 --> 17:38.425
For me, I mean,
I have my struggles with it.

17:38.458 --> 17:42.797
You know? And most musicians
or artists do.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.232
But at the same time,
I was determined, you know?

17:45.265 --> 17:48.402
I felt our band was good enough
that we deserved an audience.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.103
And...

17:51.639 --> 17:54.274
So, I just... I followed...

17:54.308 --> 17:55.610
I followed that path.

17:55.643 --> 17:57.377
And I just think
it was a lot easier for me

17:57.411 --> 17:58.880
than it was for Jake.

17:58.913 --> 18:01.816
You know, for some reason,

18:01.849 --> 18:03.618
Jake's, whatever his
inner demons were,

18:03.651 --> 18:05.285
or whatever
you want to call them,

18:05.319 --> 18:08.856
he was a lot more ambivalent

18:08.890 --> 18:10.625
about the kind of success
he was able to have.

18:14.862 --> 18:17.331

21:11.438 --> 21:13.808

21:14.575 --> 21:16.343
Nice to hear from you.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.713
I guess Kathy Madison
got in touch?

21:18.746 --> 21:19.781
<i>Yes, she did.</i>

21:19.814 --> 21:21.816
<i>Pretty wild idea,
if you ask me.</i>

21:21.849 --> 21:24.384
<i>Probably a waste
of Kathy Madison's money.</i>

21:24.417 --> 21:25.853
<i>Although, I guess
she can afford it.</i>

21:27.487 --> 21:29.389
So, I take it you don't think

21:29.422 --> 21:31.893
Jake Lion could
actually be alive and well

21:31.926 --> 21:33.493
and living in Paris?

21:33.528 --> 21:35.328
<i>Isn't that what they said
about Jacques Brel?</i>

21:36.463 --> 21:37.999
<i>Are you free for dinner?</i>

21:38.032 --> 21:39.667
<i>I'll tell you
exactly what I think</i>

21:39.700 --> 21:40.701
<i>and what I know.</i>

21:42.069 --> 21:43.070
<i>Hmm.</i>

21:50.912 --> 21:52.445
So, you're English.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.682
Correct! What gave me away,
the accent?

21:54.715 --> 21:57.484
I've been here so long,
I thought I sounded French.

21:58.085 --> 21:59.554
So, why Paris?

21:59.587 --> 22:01.923
Wine, women,
and song, I guess.

22:02.523 --> 22:03.691
Come on.

22:03.724 --> 22:05.927
I was working
for a label in London,

22:05.960 --> 22:09.462
and they needed someone in the
international department who spoke English.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.800
So, in Paris, <i>je suis
Anglais, je parle Anglais.</i>

22:12.834 --> 22:13.868
Been here ever since.

22:13.901 --> 22:15.536
And you worked with Jake Lion.

22:15.570 --> 22:18.539
I was supposed to be
his liaison here in Paris.

22:18.573 --> 22:20.608
Make sure he didn't
get into too much trouble.

22:21.742 --> 22:23.845
And he threw himself
into a river?

22:23.878 --> 22:25.012
I hate to say it,

22:25.046 --> 22:26.714
but you didn't do
too good a job.

22:26.747 --> 22:28.481
You think so?
I fucked up, did I?

22:28.516 --> 22:29.750
Yeah, maybe not.

22:29.784 --> 22:31.986
But there were lots of other
people there when he did it.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.754
- And you weren't there.
- No. Not at that moment.

22:33.788 --> 22:36.057
So I don't really know
what happened.

22:36.090 --> 22:38.960
I'm asking because there still
seems to be some questions

22:38.993 --> 22:41.494
about whether his body
was even found or not.

22:41.529 --> 22:43.197
The answer is yes and no.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.199
What do you mean?

22:45.233 --> 22:47.201
It's not really
a dinner conversation.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.736
I've got a strong stomach.

22:48.769 --> 22:49.770
Come on.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.772
Okay.

22:51.806 --> 22:54.609
So, a corpse
bobs to the surface

22:54.642 --> 22:57.612
about a year later,
in terrible condition.

22:57.645 --> 23:01.115
Eyes gone, nose gone.
You don't want to know.

23:01.148 --> 23:04.451
There's more bodies floating in
the Seine than you would imagine.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.452
Suicides?

23:05.485 --> 23:08.589
Yeah. For lonely people,
the river is a friend.

23:08.623 --> 23:11.491
So, how did this particular body
become Jake Lion?

23:11.525 --> 23:12.593
Simple, really.

23:12.627 --> 23:16.564
Someone at that morgue
had to identify the corpse.

23:16.597 --> 23:19.033
Jake Lion's name
was among the missing.

23:19.066 --> 23:21.802
<i>Voila!</i> Case closed.

23:21.836 --> 23:24.071
And that's the body buried
at Pere-Lachaise?

23:24.105 --> 23:25.239
<i>Exactement.</i>

23:25.273 --> 23:27.108
But apparently,
he had a brother

23:27.141 --> 23:30.111
who came over
to identify the body, right?

23:30.144 --> 23:33.514
Yeah. I think the record company
had something to do with that,

23:33.547 --> 23:34.949
but I don't know the details.

23:34.982 --> 23:37.151
It was above my paygrade.

23:37.184 --> 23:38.886
The record company?

23:38.920 --> 23:42.489
Yeah. Jake Lion dead meant
lots of records could be sold.

23:42.523 --> 23:43.958
Jake Lion just missing?

23:44.659 --> 23:46.027
Meant nothing.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.262
And the record label, the company
I was working for here in Paris,

23:48.296 --> 23:49.764
they paid for the burial

23:49.797 --> 23:51.766
and they gave Jake's brother,
who is broke,

23:51.799 --> 23:54.902
quite a lot of money
to sign off on the royalties.

23:54.936 --> 23:56.570
Win-win situation.

23:56.604 --> 23:58.839
For everyone but Jake Lion.

23:58.873 --> 24:00.675
But still, nobody understands

24:00.708 --> 24:03.177
why this guy
would take his own life.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.312
Including me.

24:04.345 --> 24:07.581
It wasn't even drugs,
so why do you think he did it?

24:07.615 --> 24:09.183
Honestly, I don't know.

24:09.216 --> 24:10.718
But I do remember

24:10.751 --> 24:12.586
there was an insurance policy.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.956
Our head office
in the USA canceled it

24:14.989 --> 24:16.791
because rumor had it,

24:16.824 --> 24:18.693
Jake had a terminal illness,

24:18.726 --> 24:19.860
was dying,

24:19.894 --> 24:21.862
and his brother
was the beneficiary.

24:21.896 --> 24:23.097
I do remember that.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.865
Be that as it may,

24:24.899 --> 24:28.769
we decided on this side of the
pond, to keep paying the insurance.

24:28.803 --> 24:30.004
But why did you guys do that?

24:30.037 --> 24:32.173
Because Paris
isn't New York, is it?

24:32.206 --> 24:33.541
Speaking of which,

24:33.574 --> 24:36.877
you should let me
show you around Paris.

24:36.911 --> 24:39.280
I hope you take
better care of me

24:39.313 --> 24:40.815
than you did Jake Lion.

24:40.848 --> 24:42.583
Oh, I can guarantee you that.

It's so beautiful.

26:11.906 --> 26:12.940
I never could believe

26:12.973 --> 26:15.843
that the Phantom
actually lived there.

26:15.876 --> 26:18.946
I think he lives
on Broadway now.

26:18.979 --> 26:22.783
Kathy Madison thinks Jake has
something to do with the Phantom.

26:22.817 --> 26:24.385
Like he is a Phantom?

26:24.418 --> 26:27.021
Like there is a mystery
I have to solve.

26:27.054 --> 26:28.189
Hmm.

26:30.391 --> 26:33.394
If Jake Lion is alive,
the only mystery is

26:33.427 --> 26:35.262
why that bloke
is not in Beverly Hills

26:35.296 --> 26:36.997
hanging out by a swimming pool.

26:37.031 --> 26:39.300
Maybe he didn't want all that.

26:39.333 --> 26:42.436
You're saying a metro
is a cooler place to hang out?

26:42.470 --> 26:45.372
Well, you know,
he came from the military.

26:45.406 --> 26:46.440
What do you mean?

26:46.474 --> 26:48.142
I was googling him last night.

26:48.175 --> 26:50.678
Divorced parents,
father in the army,

26:50.711 --> 26:52.446
a brother somewhere,
messed up.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.783
If you were Jake Lion,
wouldn't you have resurfaced?

26:55.816 --> 26:56.851
Why now?

26:56.884 --> 26:59.186
Take a victory lap,
reap the rewards

26:59.220 --> 27:00.955
instead of playing
in a Paris metro,

27:00.988 --> 27:03.090
if that's where he actually is.

27:11.232 --> 27:14.401
Well, that's better than living
down in the sewer

27:14.435 --> 27:15.302
like the Phantom.

27:15.336 --> 27:18.105
I know where
the Phantom used to live.

27:18.139 --> 27:20.708
Tell me where you used to live.

27:21.876 --> 27:24.178
Believe me, I've been there.

27:25.246 --> 27:27.047
What do you mean?

27:27.081 --> 27:29.383
I kind of lived
in the depths myself.

27:29.416 --> 27:33.721
You see, I lost both
of my parents too soon.

27:34.221 --> 27:35.689
I felt lost, too.

27:36.423 --> 27:38.726
And there was a man

27:39.460 --> 27:41.829
who took me under his wings

27:42.763 --> 27:44.732
and turned my nosedive

27:44.765 --> 27:47.968
into a pretty painful
crash landing,

27:48.002 --> 27:49.170
so to speak.

27:50.738 --> 27:51.939
For that reason,

27:52.907 --> 27:55.743
I need time to feel safe.

28:21.135 --> 28:24.038
I think I should just
go back to New York, Joe.

28:24.071 --> 28:26.073
I've been searching
the metro for days,

28:26.106 --> 28:28.309
but I can't look
in every station.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.778
That would take forever.

28:30.811 --> 28:32.947
<i>Listen, I have

28:32.980 --> 28:34.448

28:40.555 --> 28:41.889
You want to tag along?

28:42.890 --> 28:43.891
<i>Not really.</i>

28:44.992 --> 28:47.294
<i>I've got too much work.</i>

28:47.328 --> 28:49.830

29:13.954 --> 29:16.056
Hey, mate, pour me a beer.

29:17.559 --> 29:20.394
Excuse me. Do you play
in the metro?

29:20.427 --> 29:23.163
Sometimes. Today I did.

29:23.197 --> 29:25.399
Not much money there anymore.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.602
Chinese don't go for my music,
I'm afraid.

29:27.636 --> 29:29.504
What kind of music do you play?

29:29.537 --> 29:30.938
Flamenco.

29:30.971 --> 29:33.841
But heavy metal flamenco,
like Morente.

29:33.874 --> 29:35.109
Okay.

29:35.142 --> 29:37.579
I'm looking for a musician
who plays in the metro.

29:37.612 --> 29:38.879
American guy.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.383
Looks like a holdout
from the '70s.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.852
He plays guitar. Long hair.

29:44.885 --> 29:46.186
Sounds like me.

29:46.220 --> 29:47.888
Yeah, something like you.

29:48.956 --> 29:51.458
Well, there is this guy.

29:51.492 --> 29:54.028
I sometimes hear him
at Pere-Lachaise on Fridays.

29:55.029 --> 29:57.231
- What's today?
- Thursday.

29:57.264 --> 29:58.633
Try at around 9:00,

29:58.667 --> 30:00.401
when everyone is going to work.

30:00.434 --> 30:03.404
- That's the best time.
- I will. Thanks a lot.

33:34.782 --> 33:37.251
Sorry, I don't have any euros,

33:37.284 --> 33:40.254
and I suppose you don't take
American Express?

33:40.287 --> 33:42.657
Sure.

33:42.690 --> 33:46.493
Amex, Mastercard, Visa.

33:46.528 --> 33:49.062
You give me the card,
I'll take it with me.

33:49.764 --> 33:51.465
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

33:52.232 --> 33:53.601
I don't know.

33:53.635 --> 33:55.102
I'm kind of busy now,

33:55.135 --> 33:56.804
can't you see?

33:56.838 --> 33:58.806
Can't leave
the store unattended.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.409
So, can I offer you a drink?

34:03.611 --> 34:05.078
I already have a drink.

34:06.714 --> 34:08.550
You want some?

34:08.583 --> 34:12.119
But I'd really like to ask you
a few questions.

34:12.152 --> 34:13.152
Yeah?

34:14.288 --> 34:15.556
Questions about what?

34:16.489 --> 34:18.225
About the old times,

34:19.226 --> 34:21.261
Jake.

34:21.295 --> 34:25.232
I don't know what old times
you might be referring to,

34:25.264 --> 34:29.637
and my name
is not Jake either.

34:29.670 --> 34:33.340
So why don't you just get on,
move along,

34:33.373 --> 34:35.475
and go visit
Jim Morrison's grave

34:35.510 --> 34:37.512
with the rest of the tourists?

34:38.045 --> 34:39.581
I am not a tourist,

34:39.614 --> 34:40.815
I'm a journalist.

34:40.848 --> 34:43.717
And I'm here to write a story.

34:43.751 --> 34:46.554
I don't care who you are
or what you do.

34:46.588 --> 34:48.790
And I suppose you're
just one more American

34:48.822 --> 34:51.726
poking her nose
into other people's business.

34:51.759 --> 34:53.493
Now, if you want
to buy me a drink,

34:54.194 --> 34:56.898
I might accept your hospitality.

34:56.931 --> 34:59.901
But if you call me
Jake again,

34:59.934 --> 35:03.638
I might slit
your pretty little throat.

35:03.671 --> 35:06.106
I don't have a lot to lose
at this point.

35:06.641 --> 35:07.875
You got a temper.

35:08.910 --> 35:11.345
- Sometimes.
- Okay.

35:11.378 --> 35:13.615
I'm sorry if I offended you.

35:13.648 --> 35:15.182
Let's start over.

35:15.215 --> 35:16.751
I'm Meg Trudeau,

35:16.784 --> 35:19.821
and I write
for <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine.

35:19.854 --> 35:22.924
And I think you have a great
voice, whoever you are.

35:23.490 --> 35:25.526
A real music lover, eh?

35:25.560 --> 35:27.494
Yes, I like music,

35:27.528 --> 35:29.262
and I write about music,

35:29.296 --> 35:31.298
especially your kind of music.

35:31.331 --> 35:34.636
Hold on, you've got some kind
of a French accent.

35:34.669 --> 35:36.470
Are you bullshitting me?

35:36.504 --> 35:38.740
Not at all. I am French.

35:38.773 --> 35:41.542
But I work in New York,
I live in New York.

35:41.576 --> 35:43.945
In fact, I wish I was
in New York now.

35:44.779 --> 35:46.581
Well, then I'd say

35:46.614 --> 35:49.349
you're some kind of mixed up,
shook up girl.

35:49.383 --> 35:51.552
Sounds like
the title of a song.

35:51.586 --> 35:53.788
It is. Willy DeVille.

35:53.821 --> 35:56.624
- Dead now.
- Should have known.

35:56.658 --> 35:58.626
You said something
about buying me a drink?

35:58.660 --> 35:59.661
Mm-hmm.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.495
Let's go.

36:02.730 --> 36:03.731
I got it.

36:45.907 --> 36:46.908
What do you want?

37:01.989 --> 37:03.024
Okay.

37:04.759 --> 37:06.627
No, only for today.

37:13.467 --> 37:14.602
Do you know Jake Lion?

37:15.737 --> 37:16.771
I know he's dead.

37:17.471 --> 37:18.906
Buried over there.

37:18.940 --> 37:21.542
Next to his buddy, Jim Morrison.

37:21.576 --> 37:22.442
Like I said,

37:22.476 --> 37:24.979
you can go pay him a visit
if you want.

37:25.012 --> 37:27.882
I'm sure he'd be thrilled
if you sit on his...

37:27.915 --> 37:29.483
grave.

37:29.517 --> 37:31.586
He threw himself into the
Seine, didn't he?

37:32.319 --> 37:33.688
That's right.

37:33.721 --> 37:35.288
But they didn't bring him
to Pere-Lachaise

37:35.322 --> 37:36.924
until a year later.

37:36.958 --> 37:40.293
The river takes its time
burping up its dead.

37:50.037 --> 37:51.906
So,
you seem to know a lot about him.

37:51.939 --> 37:54.642
Jesus Christ!
You almost stabbed me

37:54.675 --> 37:56.376
when I mentioned his name.

37:56.409 --> 37:58.411
I don't like being disturbed
when I'm working.

37:59.346 --> 38:01.549
And there's something else.

38:01.582 --> 38:04.919
Jake Lion, he was my brother.

38:04.952 --> 38:08.388
So, you are the brother
the record company paid off?

38:08.421 --> 38:11.391
I'm the only brother
Jake Lion ever had.

38:11.424 --> 38:14.494
And I drank that money away
a long time ago.

38:14.996 --> 38:17.832
I'm Erik Lion.

38:17.865 --> 38:20.635
- So, what are you doing here?
- What do you think?

38:20.668 --> 38:22.870
Playing my guitar in the metro.

38:22.904 --> 38:25.907
You're not too observant for a journalist, are you?

38:25.940 --> 38:27.975
I've been living in Paris
for 40 years.

38:28.709 --> 38:29.911
Came over

38:29.944 --> 38:32.479
when they finally found
Jake's body.

38:32.513 --> 38:34.414
Someone had to identify it.

38:34.447 --> 38:36.717
And that someone was me,

38:36.751 --> 38:38.786
his brother, Erik.

38:38.820 --> 38:39.821
Got it?

38:40.688 --> 38:41.923
Oh, shit.

38:41.956 --> 38:44.525
This is not going to go
down well at <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

38:44.559 --> 38:46.761
Kathy won't be happy at all.

38:46.794 --> 38:49.362
- Kathy Madison?
- You knew her?

38:49.396 --> 38:51.532
Not me.

38:51.566 --> 38:54.902
But I knew that her and Jake were
more than friends at some point.

38:54.936 --> 38:56.103
Mind you, personally,

38:56.137 --> 38:57.805
I never went
for those rich chicks

38:57.839 --> 38:59.707
pretending to be hippies.

38:59.740 --> 39:02.610
Used to call them
"Trust fund babes."

39:02.643 --> 39:05.646
Funny that Kathy never told me
Jake's brother is alive.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.616
Or maybe I've been dead
a long time too,

39:08.649 --> 39:10.618
'cause no one has heard
from me in years.

39:11.586 --> 39:12.954
I'm like a ghost.

39:24.198 --> 39:26.000
Like the Phantom of the Opera?

39:27.535 --> 39:28.936
Yeah.

39:28.970 --> 39:31.072
Like that guy who put on a mask,

39:31.105 --> 39:32.405
hid from the world,

39:33.207 --> 39:35.076
because he was so fucking ugly

39:36.244 --> 39:37.545
and deformed.

39:38.579 --> 39:39.914
He was a genius

39:40.681 --> 39:42.049
but nobody cared.

39:43.784 --> 39:45.418
And Kathy Madison,

39:45.452 --> 39:47.021
the rock 'n roll heiress,

39:47.054 --> 39:50.057
has sent you here
to find Jake Lion.

39:50.091 --> 39:51.993
What, does she still got
a thing for him?

39:52.026 --> 39:53.694
Or is it just, uh...

39:53.728 --> 39:56.831
necrophilia or some shit?

39:56.864 --> 39:58.900
Someone told us he was alive

39:58.933 --> 40:01.736
and he saw him here, in Paris,

40:01.769 --> 40:03.504
but it might be you
that he saw.

40:04.739 --> 40:06.807
Who told you that crap?

40:07.942 --> 40:09.810
A guy called Plynth.

40:09.844 --> 40:12.146
Apparently, he was a roadie
for The Words.

40:13.648 --> 40:17.885
Plynth the Persian,
Jake's nanny.

40:17.919 --> 40:21.789
He told us that he heard you
singing a song of Jake

40:21.822 --> 40:23.791
that had never been recorded.

40:23.824 --> 40:27.228
In fact, something he wrote
shortly before he died.

40:28.195 --> 40:29.397
Okay.

40:29.429 --> 40:32.233
Now, I'm going to tell you
something very few people know.

40:32.266 --> 40:36.237
It was me who taught Jake
how to write songs,

40:36.270 --> 40:37.705
how to write lyrics,

40:37.738 --> 40:40.508
how to put them with the
chords, all of that shit.

40:40.541 --> 40:43.077
In fact, most of those
The Words songs

40:43.110 --> 40:45.646
were co-composed by both of us.

40:47.782 --> 40:50.584
I knew those songs
better than anybody.

40:51.118 --> 40:52.620
And, in fact,

40:52.653 --> 40:54.522
years after I left the band,

40:54.555 --> 40:57.525
and before Jake killed himself,

40:57.558 --> 41:00.094
he would send me cassettes
of those new songs

41:01.729 --> 41:03.798
to approve or improve.

41:03.831 --> 41:05.800
Don't I have a right
to sing them?

41:05.833 --> 41:09.770
Looks like you
just blew my Pulitzer Prize.

41:10.671 --> 41:11.672
Sorry.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.109
Hey, Max, <i>la note.</i>

41:16.577 --> 41:17.979
So, what now?

41:19.347 --> 41:21.515
I got an idea.

41:21.549 --> 41:25.186
How about the story of Jake Lion
told by his brother?

41:25.219 --> 41:27.688
That wouldn't be
too bad an angle either.

41:30.257 --> 41:34.061
Why the fuck
would I want to do that?

41:35.696 --> 41:38.299
Let his poor soul
rest in peace.

41:39.633 --> 41:41.102
Isn't that what he wanted?

41:41.135 --> 41:42.169
Look,

41:42.203 --> 41:45.973
everybody thinks Jake
went crazy for no reason.

41:46.007 --> 41:49.043
Maybe you could throw
a light on that.

41:49.076 --> 41:51.812
Like a fresh insight
on an old story.

41:52.947 --> 41:56.150
There's nothing fresh
about a dead man.

41:58.052 --> 42:01.188
I'm willing to pay you
for your time.

42:01.222 --> 42:03.991
But that's an insight
that could interest me.

42:05.026 --> 42:06.894
How long are you
going to be here?

42:06.927 --> 42:08.029
Three more days.

42:08.662 --> 42:09.663
Okay.

42:10.598 --> 42:12.166
Here's the deal.

42:12.199 --> 42:14.268
You got three appointments

42:14.301 --> 42:17.004
at the place and the time

42:17.038 --> 42:18.039
I say.

42:20.908 --> 42:22.676
But what you gotta do now...

42:24.645 --> 42:25.713
Alright.

42:38.325 --> 42:40.594
By the way,
do you live near here?

42:41.162 --> 42:42.663
A place I could visit?

42:43.097 --> 42:45.199
No way.

42:45.232 --> 42:48.135
Where I live has got
nothing to do with Jake Lion.

42:48.169 --> 42:50.037
And the last thing I need

42:50.071 --> 42:53.908
is Kathy Madison
knocking on my door.

42:53.941 --> 42:57.378
I was hoping you'd say
that you lived in the cemetery.

42:57.411 --> 42:59.680
Another good angle
for the story.

43:01.015 --> 43:02.349
Brilliant angle.

43:03.751 --> 43:04.752
I gotta go.

43:05.820 --> 43:07.822
What did you say
your name was, again?

43:07.855 --> 43:09.256
Meg Trudeau.

43:10.191 --> 43:12.093
Okay, Meg Trudeau,

43:12.960 --> 43:14.261
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:14.862 --> 43:16.363
Notre-Dame.

43:16.397 --> 43:18.632
In the garden, in the back.

43:18.666 --> 43:20.167
Five o'clock, sharp.

43:20.835 --> 43:22.002
Don't be late.

43:22.036 --> 43:23.637
Don't bring anyone.

43:24.071 --> 43:25.806
And no photos

43:25.840 --> 43:27.141
or I'm gone.

43:29.343 --> 43:31.112
Just one question
before you go.

43:33.147 --> 43:35.349
Come on,
I gave you an advance.

43:39.253 --> 43:40.821
What happened to your legs?

43:42.356 --> 43:43.657
My legs?

43:44.825 --> 43:47.228
I guess I missed my polio shot.

44:16.190 --> 44:17.758
And you believe him?

44:17.791 --> 44:20.060
I mean, I believe
he's not Jake Lion.

44:20.094 --> 44:22.229
This guy's not a rock star,
he never was.

44:22.263 --> 44:25.032
He is just playing
for change in the metro.

44:25.065 --> 44:27.234
But he could be Jake's brother.

44:27.268 --> 44:29.203
The story kind of makes sense.

44:29.236 --> 44:30.371
That's not what I mean.

44:30.404 --> 44:32.439
I mean, how do you know
he's not just some guy

44:32.473 --> 44:34.441
playing the guitar
in the metro,

44:34.475 --> 44:37.811
nothing to do with Jake Lion
or his brother? Just a nobody.

44:37.845 --> 44:39.146
I don't think he is a nobody.

44:39.180 --> 44:41.248
I think he is somebody
with a story to tell.

44:41.282 --> 44:42.716
Are you sure?

44:42.750 --> 44:45.052
I'm not. But actually,
you knew him.

44:45.085 --> 44:47.354
You should come along
with me next time.

44:47.388 --> 44:49.056
No excuses.

44:55.329 --> 44:59.099
<i>♪ Are you feeling
that down today?</i>

44:59.133 --> 45:02.970

46:51.613 --> 46:53.047
You frightened me.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.381
I've been waiting an hour.

46:54.915 --> 46:56.350
I've always been here.

46:56.383 --> 46:58.952
I tried to blend in
with the gargoyles,

46:59.887 --> 47:01.322
on top of the church.

47:01.355 --> 47:04.358
- Do you mind if I record our conversation?
- Oh, no.

47:04.391 --> 47:06.093
- No way.
- Why not?

47:07.394 --> 47:08.596
Liabilities.

47:08.630 --> 47:10.097
Liabilities of what?

47:10.898 --> 47:13.367
Claims, lawsuits.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.303
You know,
sometimes I drink too much.

47:16.337 --> 47:17.471
Really?

47:18.072 --> 47:20.274
You could have fooled me.

47:21.175 --> 47:25.245
And I might say something
I shouldn't say.

47:25.279 --> 47:28.248
And if that goes down
on a tape recorder...

47:29.917 --> 47:32.319
You remember what happened
to President Nixon.

47:32.353 --> 47:33.555
What happened to Nixon?

47:35.322 --> 47:36.924
No. Nothing.

47:36.957 --> 47:40.194
Okay. I'll try to get down
everything you say

47:40.227 --> 47:42.062
as accurately I can.

47:42.597 --> 47:45.332
I hope I can at least

47:46.133 --> 47:48.369
take some notes?

47:48.402 --> 47:50.904
Yeah, as long
as there is no microphone

47:50.938 --> 47:52.239
hidden in your pen.

47:52.272 --> 47:54.609
One, two, three.

47:56.076 --> 47:57.277
So,

47:57.311 --> 47:59.179
what did Jake look like

47:59.213 --> 48:02.116
when you went
to identify his body?

48:02.149 --> 48:03.217
Hmm.

48:04.184 --> 48:05.486
Nice first question.

48:07.555 --> 48:11.959
Well, let's just say that
being underwater for a year

48:11.992 --> 48:14.161
didn't do much
for his complexion.

48:16.296 --> 48:18.332
<i>Not much was left of his face.</i>

48:18.365 --> 48:20.334
<i>But he broke his arm
when we were kids,</i>

48:20.367 --> 48:21.603
<i>fell from a tree.</i>

48:21.636 --> 48:23.904
<i>And I could still see
the scar there.</i>

48:24.606 --> 48:26.206
<i>So, that kind of nailed it,</i>

48:26.240 --> 48:28.375
<i>and I signed off
on some bullshit papers,</i>

48:28.409 --> 48:31.178
<i>put his body in my backpack,
and walked out.</i>

48:31.211 --> 48:32.312
<i>Really?</i>

48:32.346 --> 48:34.649
<i>No. Jesus Christ.</i>

48:35.617 --> 48:38.185
<i>We buried him in Pere-Lachaise</i>

48:38.218 --> 48:41.523
'cause his friend said
he liked to hang out there.

48:41.556 --> 48:43.625
I think the record company
pulled some strings

48:43.658 --> 48:44.793
to get him in there.

48:44.826 --> 48:48.262
And when that was all done,
you just stayed in Paris?

48:48.295 --> 48:52.266
Because there was no reason
to go home again.

48:52.299 --> 48:54.569
The United States
is not the best place

48:55.436 --> 48:57.971
for a disabled person.

48:58.005 --> 49:01.141
If you're not Superman,
you're kind of screwed.

49:01.709 --> 49:03.745
I inherited his guitar,

49:05.547 --> 49:08.750
and the record company gave me
some cash to keep me quiet.

49:08.783 --> 49:10.184
Quiet about what?

49:10.217 --> 49:12.453
Oh, I mean, I signed off
on his royalties,

49:12.486 --> 49:14.354
promised not to
bother them anymore.

49:15.222 --> 49:17.291
And Paris became your home.

49:18.827 --> 49:20.227
A home

49:21.495 --> 49:24.064
implies some kind of stability,

49:24.699 --> 49:26.033
so I wouldn't say that.

49:27.434 --> 49:29.336
Come on, let's take a walk.

49:32.507 --> 49:34.441
Do your legs bother you?

49:34.475 --> 49:37.712
No, but sitting next to
this damn church does.

49:52.493 --> 49:54.796
So, what kind of guy was Jake?

49:56.096 --> 49:57.097
Jake?

49:57.765 --> 49:59.199
He didn't say much

49:59.868 --> 50:01.368
even when he was a kid.

50:03.070 --> 50:05.105
But I remember him saying
to me once

50:05.573 --> 50:06.708
that his songs

50:07.742 --> 50:09.677
knew more about him

50:09.711 --> 50:11.846
than he knew about his songs.

50:13.615 --> 50:16.784
For some reason,
I imagined him as a tough guy.

50:16.818 --> 50:19.554
But things got to him
all the same.

50:19.587 --> 50:22.356
I mean, don't things
get to everyone?

50:23.390 --> 50:24.526
You know,

50:24.559 --> 50:26.126
to be a rock star,

50:26.794 --> 50:28.495
you need strong ears

50:28.963 --> 50:30.497
and a thick skin.

50:31.498 --> 50:33.768
But brains, talent...

50:34.869 --> 50:36.236
that's optional.

50:37.672 --> 50:41.375
So, what's so great
about playing in the metro?

50:42.610 --> 50:46.346
What's so great about playing
in Madison Square Garden?

50:46.380 --> 50:48.650
Did you ever play
in Madison Square Garden?

50:49.817 --> 50:51.619
<i>Uh, no. Not me.</i>

50:53.120 --> 50:54.622
<i>But I saw Jake play there.</i>

50:56.758 --> 51:00.460
<i>And all he could see
was the first four rows.</i>

51:00.494 --> 51:03.230
And that was full
of music business people.

51:03.765 --> 51:06.433
And he didn't like that.

51:06.466 --> 51:10.103
Well, Jake said that when you
first get into the business,

51:10.137 --> 51:12.540
you know, you're so impressed

51:12.574 --> 51:14.642
by these big shot executives

51:15.475 --> 51:16.544
'cause you think

51:17.311 --> 51:18.880
they control your life.

51:20.147 --> 51:21.381
But then,

51:21.415 --> 51:23.083
one day you realize

51:23.918 --> 51:25.687
you want to play
for the real people.

51:27.187 --> 51:29.791
Are you talking about you
or about Jake now?

51:33.160 --> 51:34.494
What's the difference?

51:38.700 --> 51:41.903
There is no music
without business.

51:41.936 --> 51:44.639
Sounds like a typical
loser's philosophy to me.

51:45.974 --> 51:48.141
You know what?

51:48.175 --> 51:50.612
I think you're trying
to provoke me.

51:51.779 --> 51:53.246
That was Jake's thing.

51:53.781 --> 51:55.282
I was never into that.

51:55.950 --> 51:59.654
So, Jake wanted the stardom.

51:59.687 --> 52:03.725
Well, he fell for the glitter
and the gloom like they all do.

52:06.561 --> 52:11.231
But what he couldn't stand
were the inconsistencies.

52:12.867 --> 52:15.603
<i>He told me he'd be onstage</i>

52:15.637 --> 52:18.573
<i>singing for
thousands of people,</i>

52:18.606 --> 52:21.576
<i>and then he'd be back home,
in a hotel,</i>

52:21.609 --> 52:23.945
<i>trying to find something
to watch on TV.</i>

52:25.747 --> 52:28.248
Said he couldn't stop
the screaming

52:28.750 --> 52:29.917
in his ears.

52:53.708 --> 52:56.476
Hey, <i>bonjour,</i> my friend.

53:13.661 --> 53:16.931
Sacred objects.
Gateway to the soul.

53:18.966 --> 53:23.236
Well, you were saying that
the pressure of being a star

53:23.270 --> 53:26.874
or whatever it was
you were describing,

53:26.908 --> 53:29.610
is what drove Jake
to commit suicide.

53:29.644 --> 53:31.946
But, I mean,
if he didn't like it,

53:31.979 --> 53:34.682
why didn't he just retire?

53:54.936 --> 53:58.405
Because
if he had retired,

53:58.438 --> 54:00.541
they never would have
forgiven him.

54:00.575 --> 54:02.543
The press would have
hounded him forever.

54:03.878 --> 54:05.980
But death redeems people.

54:06.881 --> 54:09.050
To die is to be reborn.

54:09.650 --> 54:12.887
Jake Lion is a legend now.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.956
And he ain't never
going to grow old.

55:37.939 --> 55:42.009
You know, had Jake been a
Greek god up on Mount Olympus,

55:42.043 --> 55:43.644
he would have been fine.

55:44.612 --> 55:47.582
But if those gods had to
come back to Holiday Inn

55:47.615 --> 55:50.952
after doing their god-like shit
all day long,

55:50.985 --> 55:52.887
they would have
committed suicide too.

55:55.022 --> 55:57.692
You see, they turned Jake
into a god,

55:57.725 --> 55:59.093
and he was a good god.

55:59.994 --> 56:01.662
But they didn't tell him

56:01.696 --> 56:03.064
it's a one way ticket.

56:03.865 --> 56:05.132
There's no way back.

56:05.967 --> 56:07.501
The only way back

56:07.535 --> 56:09.402
was to jump off that bridge.

56:09.971 --> 56:11.404
So that's what he did.

56:12.773 --> 56:14.976
Jake jumped off that bridge

56:15.009 --> 56:16.744
so his legend would live.

56:20.014 --> 56:21.048
You know what?

56:21.082 --> 56:24.185
I'm getting tired.
That's all I've got for today.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.087
I just have a couple
of more questions.

56:27.622 --> 56:28.756
No.

56:28.789 --> 56:31.092
No, no, no, no.

56:31.125 --> 56:33.160
I don't have
a couple more answers.

56:34.095 --> 56:35.630
I'll see you tomorrow,

56:36.597 --> 56:37.665
same time.

58:04.585 --> 58:06.187
He says he is the brother.

58:06.220 --> 58:08.155
He knows about you and Jake.

58:08.189 --> 58:09.991
<i>Well, he might have
mentioned it a couple of times</i>

58:10.024 --> 58:12.893
but I don't remember
ever meeting him.

58:12.927 --> 58:15.963
I thought he'd disappeared
during the Vietnam War.

58:15.997 --> 58:18.699
<i>Just vanished
or something like that.</i>

58:18.733 --> 58:22.603
So, what does any of this have
to do with <i>Phantom of the Opera?</i>

58:22.636 --> 58:24.105
I don't get it.

58:24.138 --> 58:27.274
I thought it would be
a good way to frame the story.

58:27.308 --> 58:28.843
But if Jake is dead...

58:29.577 --> 58:31.645
Seems that way.

58:31.679 --> 58:34.181
So, I suppose you should be
getting back to New York.

58:36.017 --> 58:38.319
This trail is going nowhere.

58:38.352 --> 58:40.221
Give me a few days.

58:40.254 --> 58:43.591
I've been searching online, and there
are hundreds of photos of Jake Lion,

58:43.624 --> 58:46.327
but hardly anything
about his brother, Erik,

58:46.360 --> 58:49.997
aside from he is listed
as a composer along with Jake

58:50.031 --> 58:52.333
of some of The Words' songs.

58:52.366 --> 58:53.868
<i>Can't you find out anything?</i>

58:54.935 --> 58:56.203
Well,

58:56.237 --> 58:58.072
I'll try,

58:58.105 --> 59:01.308
but Jake's brother
is not the story we want,

59:01.342 --> 59:03.978
and it's not the reason
I sent you to Paris either.

59:04.011 --> 59:07.048
No, you expected me
to find Jake Lion.

59:07.982 --> 59:09.083
Why not?

59:10.785 --> 59:12.887
So we beat on,

59:12.920 --> 59:15.089
boats against the current,

59:15.122 --> 59:18.092
<i>borne back ceaselessly
into the past.</i>

59:18.125 --> 59:21.395
If you start quoting
F. Scott Fitzgerald to me,

59:21.429 --> 59:23.631
I'm going to jump
in the river too.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.237
I have a meeting this afternoon
with Erik at the Opera.

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:39.173
It's a good time for you to try
and see if it's really him.

01:00:39.206 --> 01:00:42.910
Okay, I'll play spy.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:46.447
And can't we go to the police
to find out the whereabouts

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.015
of this Erik Lion guy?

01:00:48.048 --> 01:00:50.084
I've got a contact there.
I'll see what I can do.

01:00:51.185 --> 01:00:53.220
Thank you, darling.

01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:54.455
You know better than that.

01:01:25.052 --> 01:01:26.787
Look at this place.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.389
The stories it could tell.

01:01:29.524 --> 01:01:31.526
Like the one about the Phantom.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.727
But I believe
the Phantom of the Opera,

01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:35.296
he was a rocker at heart.

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:37.898
Of course he was.

01:01:37.932 --> 01:01:40.234
Kind of like Alice Cooper.

01:01:40.267 --> 01:01:43.538
But the Phantom liked to play
in the opera,

01:01:43.572 --> 01:01:45.973
and I like to play
in the metro.

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:49.176
And what happens if the police
catch you playing down there,

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.878
in the metro without a license?

01:01:51.312 --> 01:01:52.880
Nothing.

01:01:52.913 --> 01:01:55.916
They leave me alone,
<i>Le flic,</i> the cops.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.852
At first, they used
to throw me out.

01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:02.389
I'd go upstairs, I'd be back
here in five minutes.

01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:05.192
You know, they're music lovers.

01:02:05.226 --> 01:02:07.962
I sing them a song,
they'll leave me alone.

01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:10.231
They only throw you out
if you can't sing.

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:13.968
But how did you know
I didn't have a license?

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:16.103
I know you went to Vietnam, too.

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:17.805
Clever girl.

01:02:17.838 --> 01:02:19.039
Doing your homework.

01:02:20.107 --> 01:02:22.409
Ooh, naughty, too.

01:02:24.311 --> 01:02:25.779
Come with me, quickly.

01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:05.452
Where are you taking me?

01:03:05.486 --> 01:03:07.454
Isn't this
what you wanted to see?

01:03:07.488 --> 01:03:10.090
The home
of the Phantom of the Opera?

01:03:11.425 --> 01:03:14.629
I could tell you about another
monster while we're down here.

01:03:14.663 --> 01:03:15.829
My father.

01:03:16.897 --> 01:03:19.933
- How about that?
- Your father?

01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:24.438
Army lifer guy, retired as
a three-star general.

01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:28.042
Maybe that explains
why Jake was such a rebel.

01:03:28.942 --> 01:03:31.412
That doesn't explain shit!

01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:33.847
You wanna play the shrink
or do you want to listen?

01:03:33.881 --> 01:03:37.051
I'm so sorry. Please, go on.

01:03:37.084 --> 01:03:40.254
Jake and I,
we grew up on Long Island.

01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:43.457
The old man, he was out
in Washington D.C.

01:03:44.391 --> 01:03:47.194
One time, Jake and The Words,

01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:48.395
they were playing a gig there.

01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:50.230
So, Jake decided
to pay him a visit,

01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:51.465
I don't know in hopes of what.

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:54.001
And you know what happened?

01:03:54.034 --> 01:03:56.103
The old man told him
to get a haircut

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:58.472
and slammed the door
in his face.

01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:04.211
And yet, you just told me that
your father had no effect on Jake.

01:04:05.079 --> 01:04:07.348
Jake hardly reacted.

01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:09.517
Well, he got into heroin
for a year.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.251
But finally,

01:04:12.186 --> 01:04:13.287
the old man,

01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:15.657
he just disowned him.

01:04:16.558 --> 01:04:19.527
That was a big inconsistency
for Jake.

01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:20.928
I'm so sorry.

01:04:20.961 --> 01:04:23.897
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:26.300
<i>C'est la vie,

- No, no, no.
- Give it here.

01:04:29.937 --> 01:04:31.338
I got it.

01:06:42.537 --> 01:06:43.538
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:06:46.574 --> 01:06:47.675
Let's see.

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:53.313
No.

01:06:55.249 --> 01:06:57.017
I think, uh...

01:06:59.219 --> 01:07:00.220
No.

01:07:03.558 --> 01:07:04.993
Oh, yeah.

01:07:07.662 --> 01:07:09.496
Will you look at this?

01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:13.100
A smoking jacket.

01:07:13.133 --> 01:07:15.335
Do you need a tuxedo?
What for?

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.339
I got a formal event
coming up.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.328
So, how do I look?

01:07:43.698 --> 01:07:45.198
You look

01:07:45.232 --> 01:07:46.501
totally absurd.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.169
No. But I mean in a good way.

01:07:49.202 --> 01:07:50.203
Cool absurd.

01:07:51.573 --> 01:07:53.240
Okay.

01:07:53.273 --> 01:07:54.709
That's the look I'm going for.

01:07:57.277 --> 01:07:58.713
You can pay the gentleman.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.616
Subtract it from my fee.

01:08:14.963 --> 01:08:16.363
- <i>Merci.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:56.738
So, what are we doing here?

01:08:57.904 --> 01:08:59.674
There's going to be a concert.

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:00.707
For whom?

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.542
For the locals.

01:09:02.577 --> 01:09:04.511
You're joking.

01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:06.279
I never joke about birds.

01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:09.316
They used to be dinosaurs once.

01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:10.350
And?

01:09:11.019 --> 01:09:12.553
You can be in my dream.

01:09:12.587 --> 01:09:14.254
If I can be in yours.

01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:16.758
Bob Dylan.

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:19.225
Yeah, whatever makes you happy.

01:09:20.528 --> 01:09:22.930
I can be happy in ways
you couldn't imagine.

01:09:22.964 --> 01:09:24.832
For instance?

01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:28.201
Looking over Paris rooftops
at night

01:09:28.234 --> 01:09:30.537
when the city loses
its human dimension

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:33.407
and everything makes sense.

01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:40.848
<i>Bonjour,</i> Olivier.

01:09:41.683 --> 01:09:42.984
Olivier...

01:09:43.017 --> 01:09:44.652
What did you say
your name was?

01:09:44.685 --> 01:09:46.353
- Meg.
- Meg.

01:09:46.386 --> 01:09:47.955
Meg, Olivier.

01:09:47.988 --> 01:09:49.256
<i>Enchante.</i>

01:09:54.696 --> 01:09:56.430
Come on, let's get started.

01:09:56.463 --> 01:09:58.599
The natives
are growing restless.

01:09:58.633 --> 01:10:01.301
I think most of your public
are sleeping.

01:10:01.903 --> 01:10:03.470
Even better.

01:10:03.504 --> 01:10:05.305
Then I got nothing to lose.

01:10:07.842 --> 01:10:11.713
Young lady, I reserve
my private booth for you.

01:10:12.279 --> 01:10:14.015
It's booth number nine.

01:10:14.048 --> 01:10:15.850
<i>Merci beaucoup, monsieur.</i>

01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:18.251
I wish you a big success.

01:10:18.285 --> 01:10:20.454
Huh. Success.

01:10:20.487 --> 01:10:24.926
Had the Phantom of the Opera
stayed with his lover, Christine,

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:27.461
now that's what
I'd call a success.

01:14:25.032 --> 01:14:26.801
Oh, Jake,

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:30.004
you really put yourself through
a hard time, didn't you?

01:15:01.635 --> 01:15:02.903
What happened yesterday?

01:15:02.937 --> 01:15:04.672
You just disappeared.

01:15:04.705 --> 01:15:06.007
I think he knew I was there,

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.809
and all of a sudden,
I lost trace of both of you.

01:15:08.843 --> 01:15:11.012
He dragged me into the sewers.

01:15:11.045 --> 01:15:14.115
He seemed to know his way
in that labyrinth.

01:15:14.148 --> 01:15:15.950
Remember, the Phantom
of the Opera

01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:19.253
was also called
the trap-door master.

01:15:19.286 --> 01:15:22.089
I think that's his role-model.

01:15:22.123 --> 01:15:25.559
He has probably been avoiding
people for a long time.

01:15:25.593 --> 01:15:27.795
I bet he is not here legally,
whoever he is.

01:15:28.963 --> 01:15:30.731
Did you recognize him?

01:15:30.765 --> 01:15:33.701
Could have been Jake or anybody.

01:15:36.037 --> 01:15:39.140
I took this photo yesterday
when he was not looking.

01:15:39.173 --> 01:15:42.977
It shows. I can't tell if this is
Jake Lion from that lousy photograph.

01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:46.180
My last meeting with him
is today,

01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:50.217
and really, I don't have much things
to bring back to <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:51.952
It's a long story.

01:15:51.986 --> 01:15:55.723
Yes, it's not easy to get to
know someone in two days, is it?

01:15:55.756 --> 01:15:57.691
No, it isn't.

01:15:57.725 --> 01:15:59.326
But, as a journalist,

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.730
I can usually find out what
makes people tick very quickly.

01:16:03.697 --> 01:16:05.699
One interview is enough.

01:16:05.733 --> 01:16:10.204
So, what is this Erik Lion guy
actually like?

01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:13.941
I don't know. In fact,
I know very little about him.

01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:17.945
I only know what he tells me
Jake was like.

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:21.916
He thinks he is the Phantom
of the Opera.

01:16:21.949 --> 01:16:25.086
Do you know what the real name
of the Phantom was?

01:16:25.119 --> 01:16:26.921
- No.
- Erik.

01:16:55.082 --> 01:16:58.352
So, you must be the journalist.

01:16:58.986 --> 01:17:00.187
I suppose so.

01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:02.823
- Who are you?
- Erik isn't coming.

01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:05.359
He's not well today.

01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:08.095
Sometimes he drinks so much
that he can't even stand up.

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:12.366
Unfortunately, today
is one of those days.

01:17:12.399 --> 01:17:15.102
So, he asked me to come instead.

01:17:16.203 --> 01:17:17.771
My name is Christine.

01:17:18.339 --> 01:17:19.974
- Christine?
- Yes.

01:17:20.808 --> 01:17:21.809
Is something wrong?

01:17:22.309 --> 01:17:23.310
No.

01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.946
Yes.

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.716
Actually, he mentioned yesterday
that name.

01:17:29.383 --> 01:17:31.418
But I need to speak with Erik.

01:17:31.852 --> 01:17:33.387
It was our deal.

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.089
I need to know more about Jake.

01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:43.764
Well, nobody is perfect,

01:17:44.231 --> 01:17:46.066
darling.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.336
Anyway, Erik and I
always speak in English.

01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:50.738
Okay, whatever.

01:17:52.973 --> 01:17:54.808
I think I can be of help.

01:17:56.043 --> 01:17:58.779
Because I was there
for that terrible...

01:17:59.548 --> 01:18:01.982
- awful night.
- The night when he...

01:18:02.016 --> 01:18:05.286
When Jake Lion
jumped into the river.

01:18:08.389 --> 01:18:10.357
So, what happened exactly,
that night?

01:18:11.492 --> 01:18:13.060
Nothing happened.

01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:15.329
One minute Jake was laughing,

01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:17.798
and then I turn around,
and he was gone.

01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:20.234
Like he had flown away.

01:18:21.068 --> 01:18:22.369
How did you meet Jake?

01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:26.807
I was his friend in Paris.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.108
His companion.

01:18:28.142 --> 01:18:30.277
- You mean, his lover?
- Hmm.

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:33.347
You get right to the point,
don't you?

01:18:34.114 --> 01:18:36.050
Yes.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:40.187
But, at first, I fell in love
with his voice.

01:18:40.754 --> 01:18:43.424
A voice that make ends meet,

01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:44.825
if you know what I mean.

01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:48.195
So delicate and strong

01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:49.463
at the same time.

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:53.968
Irresistibly triumphant.

01:18:54.001 --> 01:18:55.736
You were kind of a groupie.

01:18:57.539 --> 01:18:59.907
Say that name again,

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.209
and I'm history.

01:19:02.243 --> 01:19:03.844
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

01:19:03.877 --> 01:19:05.813
But tell me,
what happened that night?

01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:11.051
At first, it was amusing.
We thought it was a joke.

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:25.299
<i>Jake disappeared

01:19:25.332 --> 01:19:27.569
<i>But it wasn't the first time.</i>

01:19:27.602 --> 01:19:30.237
<i>And he would always return
to my bed</i>

01:19:30.271 --> 01:19:31.972
<i>without saying
where he had been.</i>

01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:34.609
<i>That night,</i>

01:19:34.643 --> 01:19:37.978
<i>half a dozen or so friends
had gotten together</i>

01:19:38.012 --> 01:19:41.081
<i>and went for a stroll
around the river.</i>

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:45.520
<i>When I asked Jake
what he had been up to,</i>

01:19:45.553 --> 01:19:48.989
<i>he said he'd been thinking about whether
he should take his own life or not.</i>

01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:51.458
<i>But we all laughed</i>

01:19:51.492 --> 01:19:54.194
<i>when he said
such a crazy thing.</i>

01:19:54.228 --> 01:19:57.998

01:20:06.473 --> 01:20:07.808
I think

01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:11.579
he had already chosen the spot
he wanted to jump into the river.

01:20:13.013 --> 01:20:14.214
Why do you think that?

01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:19.420
Because, that is where
the currents are the strongest.

01:20:20.555 --> 01:20:21.955
Weird guy, huh?

01:20:23.123 --> 01:20:26.126
What did you all do
after he jumped?

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.962
What did we do? Well...

01:20:28.996 --> 01:20:31.566
We stopped in a cafe
and then we all went home.

01:20:32.266 --> 01:20:33.934
Stopped in a cafe?

01:20:33.967 --> 01:20:35.002
Home?

01:20:35.035 --> 01:20:36.638
But didn't you do anything?

01:20:36.671 --> 01:20:38.673
Like call the police
or something?

01:20:38.707 --> 01:20:40.374
No, not really.

01:20:40.407 --> 01:20:42.009
I just went home

01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:44.478
and waited for him
to show up again,

01:20:44.512 --> 01:20:46.013
like usual.

01:20:46.046 --> 01:20:47.649
Soaking wet, drunk,
and laughing.

01:20:49.551 --> 01:20:51.452
But Jake never came back.

01:20:53.954 --> 01:20:56.390
So, how did you end up
with Erik?

01:20:58.192 --> 01:20:59.527
Well,

01:20:59.561 --> 01:21:01.696
I have to admit
that at first,

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:04.932
Erik was a sort of substitute,

01:21:04.965 --> 01:21:07.401
a replacement for Jake.

01:21:08.235 --> 01:21:09.236
But,

01:21:09.937 --> 01:21:11.573
as time went by,

01:21:11.606 --> 01:21:14.341
you know, things happen.

01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:17.911
I suppose coping with Erik
is not easy with his legs

01:21:17.945 --> 01:21:19.514
and his temperament.

01:21:19.547 --> 01:21:21.248
He is a handful.

01:21:21.281 --> 01:21:25.352
Well, there's days
where I adore him,

01:21:25.386 --> 01:21:27.354
and some when I don't.

01:21:29.456 --> 01:21:31.925
Nobody is forcing me to stay,

01:21:31.959 --> 01:21:33.093
but I do.

01:21:34.027 --> 01:21:35.162
It's my choice.

01:21:36.997 --> 01:21:39.299
Are they really similar?

01:21:39.967 --> 01:21:41.135
Erik and Jake?

01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:42.936
Well,

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:44.471
I'd say

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:48.442
they are both broken poet.

01:21:50.177 --> 01:21:51.378
Quite moody.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:56.049
For different reasons,
I suppose.

01:21:56.785 --> 01:21:59.453
But they are both pitiful.

01:22:02.524 --> 01:22:03.525
Well,

01:22:04.559 --> 01:22:07.394
it's all I can tell you.

01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:11.365
By the way, Erik told me to ask
you for the money you promised him.

01:22:11.398 --> 01:22:12.399
Yes.

01:22:19.072 --> 01:22:22.644
And tell him I didn't deduct
the cost of the tuxedo.

01:22:22.677 --> 01:22:24.144
It's a gift from me.

So, how's it going
with your phantom man?

01:22:57.377 --> 01:22:59.213
He didn't show up.

01:22:59.246 --> 01:23:03.050
Instead, a Frenchwoman, who claimed
she used to know Jake Lion turned up.

01:23:05.419 --> 01:23:07.354
It's getting stranger
all the time.

01:23:07.387 --> 01:23:09.490
I don't know what's real
or not.

01:23:09.524 --> 01:23:11.559
You seem quite real to me.

01:23:13.093 --> 01:23:15.462
Don't count on it, Joe.

01:23:15.496 --> 01:23:17.464
You know
I'm going home tomorrow.

01:23:18.499 --> 01:23:19.767
Where do you go?

01:23:20.869 --> 01:23:22.504
Well, now,

01:23:22.537 --> 01:23:24.739
I promise not to disappear
if you don't want me to,

01:23:24.772 --> 01:23:28.610
or throw myself into the
Seine or haunt the Opera.

01:23:28.643 --> 01:23:29.777
At least not tonight.

01:23:36.483 --> 01:23:40.354
Didn't any alarms go off
when you were with Mr. Lion,

01:23:40.387 --> 01:23:42.289
supposedly taking care of him?

01:23:42.322 --> 01:23:44.057
- What are you getting at?
- You must have seen

01:23:44.091 --> 01:23:46.828
some signs, like,
he was depressed,

01:23:46.861 --> 01:23:48.028
or...

01:23:49.864 --> 01:23:51.498
There was something.

01:23:51.533 --> 01:23:54.434
I probably should have
taken it more seriously,

01:23:54.468 --> 01:23:56.436
but at the time,
it seemed like a joke.

01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.573
What are you
talking about, Joe?

01:23:58.606 --> 01:24:01.074
There was a meeting
at the record label.

01:24:01.108 --> 01:24:03.611
Everybody was there.
The head of the label at the time,

01:24:03.645 --> 01:24:05.312
lots of important people.

01:24:05.345 --> 01:24:08.081
And Jake was there?

01:24:08.115 --> 01:24:10.183
Yeah, of course.
The meeting was about Jake.

01:24:10.217 --> 01:24:12.452
What he was going to do.
His band, The Words, had broken up,

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:14.221
and now he was in Paris.

01:24:14.254 --> 01:24:16.758
It was really about the future
of his career.

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:19.493
Someone made a stupid joke.

01:24:20.528 --> 01:24:22.195
What kind of joke?

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:24.164
Something about...

01:24:24.197 --> 01:24:27.735
Jim Morrison's death
being a great career move.

01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:30.437
That's kind of funny in a way.

01:24:31.573 --> 01:24:33.775
Well, everyone laughed but Jake.

01:24:35.442 --> 01:24:37.344
It was kind of awkward, really.

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.147
He left, went to the toilet,

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.383
never came back.
Left us there waiting for him.

01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:48.221
I lost him for a few days
till that night on the bridge.

01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:51.626
And you think that might have
put the idea in his head.

01:24:51.659 --> 01:24:53.561
I don't want
to think about that.

01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:57.865
You know, in Paris, Meg,

01:24:57.899 --> 01:25:00.334
it's a tradition to have
a glass of champagne

01:25:00.367 --> 01:25:02.302
before you make love.

01:25:02.336 --> 01:25:06.139
And, do you know, Joe,
in New York, we fuck first.

01:25:06.173 --> 01:25:07.709

01:27:21.308 --> 01:27:22.944

01:27:24.746 --> 01:27:26.914
So, that's all I've got, Kathy.

01:27:26.948 --> 01:27:30.317
This guy, he says
he is Jake's crippled brother.

01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:33.320
Also, you don't look
very convinced.

01:27:33.353 --> 01:27:37.357
Oh, well, it might be
wishful thinking on my part,

01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:39.560
but there has to be
more to the story than this.

01:27:40.695 --> 01:27:41.863
I don't know.

01:27:41.896 --> 01:27:44.532
I doubt we will be able
to find out much more.

01:27:44.565 --> 01:27:47.668
This guy, Erik,
he is very strange.

01:27:47.702 --> 01:27:49.637
Well, don't give up too easily.

01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:51.973
You told me to find out
more about Erik,

01:27:52.006 --> 01:27:54.075
so I tracked down Susan Philips.

01:27:54.675 --> 01:27:55.810
Who is she?

01:27:55.843 --> 01:27:57.712
Well,

01:27:57.745 --> 01:28:01.516
apparently, Susan used to give music
lessons to Jake and his brother

01:28:01.549 --> 01:28:04.384
when they were kids
on Long Island.

01:28:04.417 --> 01:28:07.021
You have an appointment with her at

01:28:07.922 --> 01:28:09.090

01:32:02.623 --> 01:32:04.825
Please, come in.
I've been expecting you.

01:32:15.269 --> 01:32:16.771
These boys you're looking at

01:32:16.804 --> 01:32:19.006
are Jake Lion
and his brother, Erik.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.375
About the age they were when
they used to come to my house

01:32:21.409 --> 01:32:22.910
for their music lessons.

01:32:24.245 --> 01:32:25.713
I'll get some tea.

01:32:25.746 --> 01:32:27.782
Thanks. That's really kind
of you.

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:40.027
What exactly did you teach them?

01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:41.595
Like all kids at the time,

01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:43.964
beginner guitar
and a little singing.

01:32:43.998 --> 01:32:46.867
Jake didn't like to sing
at that age. Too shy.

01:32:47.368 --> 01:32:48.636
That's amazing.

01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:50.171
They look very much alike.

01:32:51.305 --> 01:32:52.940
Physically, yes.

01:32:52.973 --> 01:32:56.210
Blonde hair, pale skin,
skinny kids.

01:32:56.243 --> 01:32:58.212
But very different characters.

01:32:58.879 --> 01:33:01.282
Jake was shy and introverted,

01:33:01.315 --> 01:33:03.918
whereas Erik was manipulative,

01:33:03.951 --> 01:33:05.152
calculating.

01:33:05.186 --> 01:33:07.088
He was behind all the mischief.

01:33:08.289 --> 01:33:10.124
Were they both good musicians?

01:33:10.157 --> 01:33:14.395
Yes. For their age and each
in his own way, of course.

01:33:14.428 --> 01:33:18.265
Jake was more sensitive,
probably more imaginative.

01:33:18.299 --> 01:33:19.700
Erik sang well.

01:33:19.733 --> 01:33:22.036
And taken together,
they were quite a pair.

01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:24.405
And,

01:33:24.438 --> 01:33:26.140
did they get along
with each other?

01:33:26.173 --> 01:33:28.142
Ah, adored each other.

01:33:28.175 --> 01:33:32.746
Erik, being the older brother,
looked after his brother.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:34.215
They went everywhere together.

01:33:34.248 --> 01:33:37.685
They lived just nearby,
right down the block.

01:33:37.718 --> 01:33:40.721
Father wasn't at home much,
him being in the military.

01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:44.425
Got divorced, and the mother...

01:33:44.458 --> 01:33:47.261
Well, I think,
married a car salesman.

01:33:47.294 --> 01:33:49.263
Took them to Arizona.

01:33:49.296 --> 01:33:51.932
I never would have heard
of him again, if...

01:33:51.966 --> 01:33:56.737
not for Jake becoming so famous
despite his illness.

01:33:56.770 --> 01:34:00.141
I taught dozens of kids
in my day, but those two...

01:34:00.174 --> 01:34:02.810
But... Excuse me. What disease?

01:34:02.843 --> 01:34:06.013
Doctor said he had
a degenerative disease

01:34:06.046 --> 01:34:08.115
since he was very young.

01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:10.117
Some kind of sclerosis,

01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:12.286
that, over time,
affects mobility,

01:34:12.319 --> 01:34:14.221
particularly in the legs.

01:34:14.255 --> 01:34:17.124
Another reason why
Erik protected him so much.

01:34:17.158 --> 01:34:20.261
Excuse me,
but I think you're mistaken.

01:34:20.294 --> 01:34:22.796
It's Erik who actually
has that disease.

01:34:23.397 --> 01:34:24.999
No, no. It was Jake.

01:34:25.032 --> 01:34:26.167
Are you sure?

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.902
Of course I am.

01:34:27.935 --> 01:34:29.036
Jake used to come in limping

01:34:29.069 --> 01:34:31.972
when he came for his music
lessons, even as a child.

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:33.774
I see.

01:34:33.807 --> 01:34:35.510
And what about Erik?

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:37.244
Erik... Rumor had it

01:34:37.278 --> 01:34:40.214
that he followed the father
to Vietnam and never came back.

01:34:40.247 --> 01:34:42.383
MIA.

01:34:42.416 --> 01:34:45.920
Nobody ever heard from him again
and they never found him.

01:34:45.953 --> 01:34:48.789
Now I hear people go there
on vacation, is that true?

01:34:48.822 --> 01:34:49.924
I suppose.

01:34:49.957 --> 01:34:52.259

Where is her royal highness?

01:35:19.588 --> 01:35:21.255
Did you bring
the rest of my cash?

01:35:21.288 --> 01:35:22.356
Well,

01:35:22.389 --> 01:35:23.991
what happens next

01:35:24.024 --> 01:35:26.193
depends on what you tell me now.

01:35:26.227 --> 01:35:28.462
What are you saying?
Did you find Jake or not?

01:35:29.230 --> 01:35:30.497
I maybe found Jake,

01:35:30.532 --> 01:35:33.300
but the Jake I found
told me he was not Jake.

01:35:33.334 --> 01:35:34.868
Who did he say he was?

01:35:34.902 --> 01:35:36.937
He said he was Erik Lion,

01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:38.339
Jake's brother.

01:35:38.372 --> 01:35:39.473
Erik?

01:35:39.507 --> 01:35:40.575
No fucking way.

01:35:40.609 --> 01:35:42.876
That guy joined the army
and disappeared.

01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:44.078
Maybe he didn't.

01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:47.281
And he went back to Paris
to identify his brother's body.

01:35:47.314 --> 01:35:49.283
And he just stayed there.

01:35:49.316 --> 01:35:52.186
At least, that is what
he claims.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.422
That's impossible.

01:35:55.456 --> 01:35:58.459
Erik made a stopover in Paris
on his way to Vietnam.

01:35:58.492 --> 01:36:00.227
That's when he identified
his brother's body.

01:36:00.961 --> 01:36:02.129
After that,

01:36:02.162 --> 01:36:03.330
I don't know what happened.

01:36:03.364 --> 01:36:04.798
Even the army couldn't find him.

01:36:04.832 --> 01:36:06.800
Well, the guy I met,

01:36:06.834 --> 01:36:09.436
Jake or Erik or whoever,

01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:11.038
drinks like a fish,

01:36:11.071 --> 01:36:14.241
gives concerts for the pigeons
and walks with a cane.

01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:15.909
See what I mean?

01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:17.978
I told you
it was Jake fucking Lion!

01:36:18.012 --> 01:36:19.880
Why do you say that?

01:36:19.913 --> 01:36:22.617
Because it was Jake
who had that damn disease.

01:36:22.651 --> 01:36:24.985
There was nothing wrong with Erik.
Shit, the army took him.

01:36:25.019 --> 01:36:28.022
But, what about the body
Erik identified?

01:36:29.156 --> 01:36:30.858
Who knows?

01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:33.427
Probably some tramp
they fished out of the river.

01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.963
But the guy with the limp
you found in the metro,

01:36:35.996 --> 01:36:37.431
that had to be Jake.

01:36:37.464 --> 01:36:40.367
Then, what that woman,
his music teacher,

01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:42.870
told me must be true.

01:36:42.903 --> 01:36:45.339
So, Jake is pretending
to be his brother.

01:36:45.372 --> 01:36:47.875
Crazy like a fox.

01:36:47.908 --> 01:36:49.209
This is a mind-blower.

01:36:50.311 --> 01:36:51.945
You want something
to drink, honey?

01:36:51.979 --> 01:36:53.113
It's on me today.
What would you like?

01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:54.982
Rum and Coke.

01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:58.319
Rick, rum and Coke
for the lady.

01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.256
- And a...
- Diet Coke for you, Plynth?

01:37:04.158 --> 01:37:05.159
No booze?

01:37:05.993 --> 01:37:06.994
I'll tell you.

01:37:07.928 --> 01:37:09.229
The famous drink liquor,

01:37:10.331 --> 01:37:11.865
the idols drink water,

01:37:12.433 --> 01:37:13.901
and the legends,

01:37:13.934 --> 01:37:16.370
they don't drink nothing at all.

01:37:16.403 --> 01:37:19.940
Well, I couldn't,
and I didn't want to believe

01:37:19.973 --> 01:37:22.577
that this old pitiful guy I met

01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:26.180
was actually
the mythical Jake Lion.

01:37:26.213 --> 01:37:29.416
And when that Christine
backed up his story...

01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:30.585
Ah!

01:37:30.618 --> 01:37:33.287
So you met the famous Christine.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.389
Parisian groupie par excellence.

01:37:35.422 --> 01:37:38.192
Do you know
something about her, too?

01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:42.196
Well, from the first time
The Words played in Paris,

01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:44.298
she stuck to Jake
and kept buzzing around him

01:37:44.331 --> 01:37:45.999
even when he'd tell her
to bug off.

01:37:47.736 --> 01:37:50.605
I bet she helped to put this
whole disappearing act together.

01:37:50.638 --> 01:37:52.339
She's a crafty one.

01:37:52.373 --> 01:37:55.376
So, there might be
a story here after all.

01:37:55.409 --> 01:37:57.010
How bad were his legs?

01:37:57.044 --> 01:37:59.346
Bad. He won't be walking
for long.

01:38:03.417 --> 01:38:04.952
You know, sweetheart,

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.523
I don't think this story
is such a great idea anymore.

01:38:08.989 --> 01:38:10.491
What do you mean?

01:38:10.525 --> 01:38:12.493
Don't you want
the rest of your money?

01:38:12.527 --> 01:38:15.195
No story, no cash.

01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:17.231
That's what Kathy Madison says.

01:38:19.066 --> 01:38:21.101
Sure, I could use the money,

01:38:21.135 --> 01:38:22.436
but I could also live
without it.

01:38:24.739 --> 01:38:26.641
Shit.

01:38:26.674 --> 01:38:29.544
Maybe we should let Jake Lion
stay a dead legend,

01:38:29.577 --> 01:38:31.646
better than a living liar
and a cripple.

01:38:32.479 --> 01:38:35.215
People wouldn't forgive him
for that.

01:38:35.249 --> 01:38:37.585
And, you and I would end up
not forgiving ourselves either.

01:38:38.485 --> 01:38:40.655
Just think about it.

01:38:40.688 --> 01:38:42.757
How are you going to feel
when a shitload of paparazzi

01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:44.759
descends on that metro stop,

01:38:44.793 --> 01:38:47.394
and Jake is trying to get away
on his cane.

01:38:47.428 --> 01:38:49.363
I want no fucking part of that.

01:38:50.097 --> 01:38:51.533
I can't believe you.

01:38:51.566 --> 01:38:53.333
You're not as tough
as you look.

01:38:55.169 --> 01:38:58.673

<i>Did you talk to Plynth?</i>

01:40:12.112 --> 01:40:13.480
Yes.

01:40:13.515 --> 01:40:16.216
Back at the fabulous Class Bar.

01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:18.285
I'm thinking
of becoming a regular.

01:40:19.888 --> 01:40:23.056
So, was it Jake
or was it not Jake?

01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:24.726
What difference does it make?

01:40:24.759 --> 01:40:27.595
I think you always knew
the truth, anyway.

01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:29.564
The truth was up to you to find.

01:40:30.632 --> 01:40:32.499
Just tell me,
do we have an article?

01:40:33.367 --> 01:40:35.269
Finally, I don't think so.

01:40:37.104 --> 01:40:38.105
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:40:39.139 --> 01:40:40.842
Could make a great story.

01:40:40.875 --> 01:40:42.175
Make your reputation.

01:40:42.911 --> 01:40:44.579
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:40:46.179 --> 01:40:49.116
Well, I guess
that's the right decision.

01:40:50.585 --> 01:40:52.620
<i>But it was never up to me
to make it.</i>

01:40:52.654 --> 01:40:57.257
Why don't you go to Paris
and see him by yourself?

01:40:57.291 --> 01:41:00.795
For the same reason that
you're not writing the story.

01:41:00.828 --> 01:41:04.231
By the way,
I might be going back to Paris
