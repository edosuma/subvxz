00:03.771 --> 00:05.187
No idea who we are
or how we got here.

00:05.188 --> 00:06.604

but the truth is we're nothing

00:06.607 --> 00:08.574

00:17.551 --> 00:20.552

00:35.636 --> 00:37.069

some quality time

00:37.071 --> 00:39.138

a pair of goggles,

00:57.591 --> 01:00.492
Some work gloves, and a brand
new micro-gauge plasma cutter

01:00.494 --> 01:03.429
With a rotating
tholium-carbide head.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.431
[three] you'll cut
your hands off, kid.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.466
What are you gonna buy?

01:19.814 --> 01:21.513
Amen.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.582

putting the money to better use-

we have to spend?

01:38.332 --> 01:41.533
Well, after refueling,
repair costs, and docking fees

01:44.754 --> 01:45.803
Not even enough
for goggles?

Or a nice meal?

01:46.841 --> 01:47.873
Or a redhead?

For setting up
that mining deal.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.268
They did.

you didn't skim hmm?

02:03.591 --> 02:07.493

to abandon you, remember?

02:07.495 --> 02:11.563
[one] what if we refuel
but not... Fully refuel?

02:11.565 --> 02:12.831
We're not skimping on fuel.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.833
I mean do we
really need to fix

02:14.835 --> 02:16.335
The meteorite
damage to the hull?

02:16.337 --> 02:18.087
Or repairs.

02:18.088 --> 02:19.838
What we need to do is find
a buyer for those weapons.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.306

02:21.308 --> 02:23.208

confusing doll.

and... Very insulting.

to ask around or what?

12:31.151 --> 12:33.084
But am also
conversant-search capable.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.420
I also possess psychological
and psychiatric subroutines

12:35.422 --> 12:38.156
Should you feel the need
for therapeutic counseling.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.491
Are you feeling depressed?

12:39.493 --> 12:41.226
Lonely?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.294
I'm fine. Thank you.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.066
I'm at your disposal
should you reconsider...

12:54.040 --> 12:56.007
[pipes hissing]

12:56.009 --> 12:58.076
[one] i don't know what
you're getting so upset about.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.411
I thought we were being
honest with each other.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.013
Nah, i was offering
constructive criticism.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.014
You were being petty.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.282
I was not being petty.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.884
I was 100% sincere

13:05.886 --> 13:08.052
When i said i find you
completely untrustworthy.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.088
[three] based on what exactly?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.356
[one]
i think this is it.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.824
No, i want to know.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.926
What makes me untrustworthy?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.563
[door slides open]

13:22.335 --> 13:24.402
[one]
i guess we're early.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.973
Huh?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.312
Fine.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.081
Process of elimination.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.766
Meaning?

13:38.767 --> 13:40.450
Somehow, someway, that kid
had all of our memories

13:40.453 --> 13:42.320
Downloaded
into her subconscious.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.422
They drift up in
dribs and drabs.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.324
And she remembers
someone, one of us,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.193
Screwing with
the stasis pods.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.894
Now why would
anyone do that?

13:49.896 --> 13:51.196
How's this
for a theory:

13:51.198 --> 13:53.198
Someone takes all of us
out of commission

13:53.200 --> 13:56.234
So they can steal the ship
and whatever else is on board.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.903
Who's the most likely suspect?

13:58.905 --> 14:00.071
I doubt it's the kid.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.873
Six seems to have
a conscience.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.174
I know
it's not me--

14:03.176 --> 14:04.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.278
You can't know that.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.979
We all passed
the lie detector test.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.981
For all we know, you
were the one planning

14:09.983 --> 14:12.450
To cut our throats
in our sleep.

14:12.452 --> 14:18.122
After all, you were
the first one to wake up.

14:18.124 --> 14:21.092
That's awful
convenient isn't it?

14:21.094 --> 14:23.161
Guess we'll have
to agree to disagree.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.596
Screw that.

14:24.598 --> 14:25.964
I don't agree to anything.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.131
[can rattling]

14:27.133 --> 14:29.133
[bomb goes boom]

14:33.139 --> 14:34.305
[three]
ugh.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.576
[three and one grimacing]

14:38.578 --> 14:40.511
[three and one coughing]

15:08.174 --> 15:10.141
What the hell?

15:10.143 --> 15:10.942
What's going on?

15:10.944 --> 15:12.477
Where are we?

15:12.479 --> 15:15.013
You're asking the
guy who's tied up with you.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.114
Great.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.949
Oh, this is fantastic.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.151
Nice to see you
keeping a positive attitude.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.152
I was being sarcastic.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.321
Yeah. So was i.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.089
Where do you get off
copping an attitude like that?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.791
This is your fault.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.492
How is it my fault
we're both sitting here?

15:28.495 --> 15:32.297
I guess if i was alone, i never
would've been taken by surprise.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.398
[three grimacing]

15:33.400 --> 15:34.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:34.350 --> 15:35.299
These wires are
cutting right into me.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.618
Agh!

15:36.619 --> 15:37.935
Look, we can either
sit here arguing

15:37.938 --> 15:40.505
Or we can work to get
out of this together.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.506
What's it gonna be?

15:41.508 --> 15:44.259
Fine.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.011
We'll work together to get out
of this, and then we'll argue.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.313
Alright.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.481
Let's try and shift
over to the door.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.550
When we're close enough,
i'll head-butt the console.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.319
Then, when we're
in the corridor,

15:54.321 --> 15:56.020
We'll yell until
help comes okay?

15:56.022 --> 15:57.088
That sounds like a plan.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.589
Alright.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.992
On the count of three, we shift.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.093
One.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.094
Two.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.063
Three!

16:05.065 --> 16:06.364
Ahh.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.132
[three]
agh!

16:08.134 --> 16:09.968
Oh, fantastic!

16:09.970 --> 16:11.169
Just perfect!

16:11.171 --> 16:13.471
Yes, i was being
sarcastic again!

16:19.646 --> 16:20.495
Okay.

16:20.496 --> 16:21.345
I think this one.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.048
Are you sure?

16:23.049 --> 16:24.749
No, but... I have a feeling.

16:24.751 --> 16:28.453
Ah, your feelings have
paid off before.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.589
Yeah sorry kid, there's no
way you're old enough to play.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.767
Unless of course you're
under proper adult supervision.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.647
What can i do for you?

17:00.320 --> 17:04.088
What can you
tell me about this?

17:04.090 --> 17:07.692
Ah, you had me
going there.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.360
This is an impressive
knock-off.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.163
At first glance, i'd swear
it was the real thing.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.731
Yeah, what is it?

17:16.436 --> 17:20.171
Of course, it can't be.

17:20.173 --> 17:25.610
For starters, i doubt
a descendant of the ishida line

17:25.612 --> 17:27.378
Would be all
the way out here,

17:27.380 --> 17:30.448
In the middle of nowhere,
hawking their family...

17:35.121 --> 17:37.455
This-- this is genuine.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.790
Where'd you get it?

17:38.792 --> 17:41.092
I found it.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.395
Y-you found it?
This isn't something you find.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.131
It's something you
kill to acquire.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.801
I-i want no part of it.

17:49.803 --> 17:50.835
Sorry we're
closing early.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.770
At least give me
some inf--

17:54.574 --> 17:57.075
[computer system]
welcome to a new era

17:57.077 --> 17:58.776
In fast, efficient, interstella.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.080
Welcome to the age
of transfer transit.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.382
No more long hours in
uncomfortable berths,

18:04.384 --> 18:07.685
No more headache-inducing stasi.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.655
With transfer transit, your next
journey to a distant star system

18:10.657 --> 18:13.091
Will feel more like
a trip to the spa.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.159
As you relax in your
custom-built pod,

18:15.161 --> 18:17.361
Your physical specifications
and an exact copy

18:17.363 --> 18:20.098
Of your consciousness will
be relayed via subspace

18:20.100 --> 18:22.667
To a receiver pod
at your destination.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.870
There, this data will be used
for final stage completion

18:25.872 --> 18:28.172
Of one of our patented temp clo.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.675
Able to maintain biological inty
for a period of up to 72 hours,

18:30.677 --> 18:33.444
This clone will serve as your se

18:33.446 --> 18:36.180
For the duration of your stay,

18:36.182 --> 18:40.251
Enjoying all the benefits
of your destination.

18:40.253 --> 18:44.222
With your thoughts,
your memories, your personality.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.458
And of course,
all of your physical abilities.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.131
Your clone will then return
to our facility for bio-mass re,

18:53.133 --> 18:56.167
But not before
all of the memories

18:56.169 --> 18:57.568
And experiences it
acquired are uploaded

18:57.570 --> 19:00.638
And transferred via
subspace back to you.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.443
Welcome back.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.379
And welcome to the future
of space travel.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.916
Transfer transit.
"better than being there."

19:13.253 --> 19:15.319
How cool is that?

19:20.860 --> 19:25.263
[five] maybe we should quit
while we've still got something.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.299
What's it gonna be, kid?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.668
[five stuttering]

19:30.670 --> 19:32.670
Take another card.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.917
Let me take over.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.369
Okay do me a favor.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.872
The next time you have
one of your great ideas,

20:07.874 --> 20:08.873
Keep it to yourself.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.775
Or i could share
it with someone

20:10.777 --> 20:11.976
Who can follow
simple instruction.

20:11.978 --> 20:12.777
Like what?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.711
Like shift.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.479
I shifted.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.246
You didn't shift.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.547
You tilted.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.847
If you'd shifted,
we'd be out of this room--

20:17.850 --> 20:18.849
I shifted!

20:18.851 --> 20:19.850
Okay, great. You shifted.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.886
Great.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.921
Good job this turned out
just like i'd planned.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.924
How long do you think before
the others come looking for us?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.926
You mean if they
come looking for us.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.695
Why wouldn't they
come looking for us?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.463
They may not come
looking for you,

20:32.465 --> 20:34.232
But they'd sure come
looking for me.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.235
What do you mean they'd
look for you and not for me?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.736
You told everyone
you were leaving.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.503
That was before.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.005
I changed my mind.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.506
Yeah well you
change your mind a lot.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.274
You're very mercurial.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.542
No you're mercurial.

20:44.543 --> 20:45.809
You don't even know
what mercurial is.

20:45.812 --> 20:46.577
Sure i do.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.478
Okay.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.879
It means shut the hell up.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.254
Took a while for the
gas to clear out of here.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.023
Eh buddy, would you mind
telling us what this is about?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.492
I'd be happy to answer
all your questions.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.895
Just as soon as you
answer a couple of mine.

21:04.897 --> 21:08.833
Who are you and what the hell
are you doing with my face?

21:18.544 --> 21:20.478
[corso]
so, tell me.

21:22.915 --> 21:23.814
Who are you?

21:23.816 --> 21:25.449
I'm jace corso.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.550
No.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.952
I'm jace corso.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.954
Which makes you... Not.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.423
So the question is:
How is this possible?

21:32.425 --> 21:35.393
At first, i thought you were jut
someone who kinda looked like m,

21:35.395 --> 21:37.695
Not enough to
fool anyone who knew me

21:37.697 --> 21:39.463
But enough to bluff
anyone who didn't.

21:39.465 --> 21:44.468
Now taking a closer look,
i see that's not the case.

21:47.974 --> 21:52.376
We're identical.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.513
So what could it be?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.949
Clone's a logical guess.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.384
The tech exists, but to pull
that off you'd have to scan me,

22:00.386 --> 22:03.321
And you can't do that
without my noticing.

22:03.323 --> 22:06.324
Besides, dupes have an average
shelf life of two to three days

22:06.326 --> 22:10.394
And i've been trying to chase
you down for months.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.830
No, you're not a clone.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.734
The only other possibility,
besides long lost twin,

22:16.736 --> 22:18.636
Is reconstructive surgery.

22:18.638 --> 22:22.840
You paid someone a lot of money
to make you look just like me.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.659
What can i say?

22:24.660 --> 22:26.477
I'm flattered you think so
highly of this handsome mug

22:26.479 --> 22:27.978
That you'd go through
the trouble.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.014
But i'm still curious.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.582
Yeah so am i.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.484
How's that?

22:33.486 --> 22:36.554
I woke up from stasis
on board a ship with no memory

22:36.556 --> 22:38.823
Of how i got there or who i was.

22:38.825 --> 22:39.990
I don't remember anything.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.859
And you expect me
to buy that?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.495
Honestly no, but it's--

22:44.497 --> 22:46.147
[three]
he's telling the truth.

22:46.148 --> 22:47.798
It wasn't just him it
was our entire crew.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.434
We all just had our
memories wiped clean.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.737
Okay, let's say i believe
you-- which i don't.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.406
But let's say i do.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.007
What's my next move?

22:57.009 --> 22:59.777
Just send you on your way,
let you keep being me?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.545
I'm not you.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.815
Look, i'm as confused as you ar,
i want answers too.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.017
Okay, this may seem obvious

23:07.019 --> 23:09.019
But i'm just gonna
throw it out there.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.821
Your beef is with him.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.890
I'm just an innocent bystander.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.531
Maybe.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.566
Then again, maybe not.

23:22.568 --> 23:26.036
So why don't you sit tight,
let the adults talk.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.805
Even though i don't
have my memories,

23:27.807 --> 23:30.508
I might be able to help
you figure things out.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.076
And how're you
going to do that?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.078
Well, how about
you start by telling me

23:34.080 --> 23:37.014
How you found out
someone stole your identity?

23:38.985 --> 23:41.051

Repetitive or even unpleasant d,
the new somnawave

been waiting for.

hi, just wondering when

23:47.660 --> 23:49.160
The doc's gonna be able to see ?

23:49.162 --> 23:50.161
It shouldn't be long.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.028
Take a number.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.563
I already took a number.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.698
Which is why i'm asking.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.434
It shouldn't be long.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.002

24:52.925 --> 24:54.859
Yessss!

24:59.799 --> 25:01.098
What's the hold-up?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.933
Hey!

25:02.935 --> 25:04.635
Hey!

25:04.637 --> 25:06.070
Let's not make a scene.

25:06.072 --> 25:09.607
We just want to have a talk.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.742
I'll be back for that.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.290
[keyboard keys clicking]

25:30.830 --> 25:33.631
[jace] a while ago,
i got approached about a job.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.634
Join a group of mercs
and help clear out a bunch

25:36.636 --> 25:39.236
Of troublemaking miners on
some independent colony.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.672
Normally, i don't
play well with others.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.708
I'm more of a solo artist.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.810
But the offer was
too rich to pass up.

25:46.812 --> 25:49.813
And besides, i'd be working with
the crew of the legendary raza.

25:49.815 --> 25:53.250
I was curious to see if
their rep matched their strut.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.085
So i accepted the offer.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.922
The day i'm supposed
to join up,

25:57.924 --> 26:00.991
The galactic authorities get
an anonymous tip and raided my .

26:00.993 --> 26:04.161
I almost got nicked...
I was on the run for a week.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.830
When things quieted down,
i was going to reach out

26:06.832 --> 26:08.899
To apologize for missing the op.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.703
I didn't want them thinking
i was unprofessional after all.

26:12.705 --> 26:16.807
Well, imagine my surprise when
i learned that i was actually sn

26:16.809 --> 26:20.844
Boarding the raza
with the rest of the crew.

26:20.846 --> 26:23.280
I checked the security footage
from the space station

26:23.282 --> 26:28.018
And, sure enough, there i was,
getting on that damn ship.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.821
Someone who looked
a lot like me anyway.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.790
And i've been chasing
you ever since.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.358
How'd you know
where to find us?

26:34.360 --> 26:35.776
Educated guess.

26:35.777 --> 26:37.193
This is the closest station
to that mining colony

26:37.196 --> 26:38.829
In any direction.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.731
If you were gonna
refuel after your op,

26:40.733 --> 26:41.865
This would be the place.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.335
And i was right.

26:44.337 --> 26:48.072
So, any of that ring a bell?

26:48.074 --> 26:51.675
Jog those...
Missing memories?

26:51.677 --> 26:53.611
No.

26:53.613 --> 26:56.880
That's too bad.

26:56.882 --> 27:02.620
Do you know what this is?

27:02.622 --> 27:05.322
I want to say curling iron.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.634

no, no, no, no, no!

27:17.202 --> 27:17.767
Wait, wait, wait, wait

27:17.770 --> 27:19.670
Just wait!

27:19.672 --> 27:21.839
Let's just make a deal.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.941
You've got my attention.

27:23.943 --> 27:27.277
We got a crate, full of
weapons back in the ship

27:27.279 --> 27:28.529
So i've heard.

27:28.530 --> 27:29.780
We're looking to
move them right.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.983
So why don't you
just take 'em.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.285
Sell 'em all, make
a nice tidy profit.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.788
Just take the guns,
you don't even have to

27:37.790 --> 27:39.657
Cut us in for anything.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.859
Then, while you let me go,

27:41.861 --> 27:44.261
I'll let you two solve
your personal issues.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.830
And ah, it's not really
my business anyway right.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.315
[one]
you sonovabitch.

27:48.316 --> 27:49.799
Why do you want
to drag me into this?

27:49.802 --> 27:51.769
Whatever happened to empathy,
and human compassion?

27:51.771 --> 27:53.203
Enough.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.805
I think i will take
those weapons after all.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.257
Great.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.708
Just get me my comm
and i'll make the arrangements.

27:57.710 --> 27:58.942
I'll make my own arrangements.

27:58.944 --> 28:00.878
No i--

28:15.194 --> 28:16.260
What's the problem?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.261

you're cheating.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.262
[two]
the hell i am.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.097
You're counting cards.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.900
You were counting the cards
that have been played

28:22.902 --> 28:23.934
To improve your odds.

28:23.936 --> 28:24.735
That's a skill.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.203
How is that cheating?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.273
It's cheating
because we say it is.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.774
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.

28:30.776 --> 28:32.776
You and your little
friend here are banned

28:32.778 --> 28:35.212
And the money you tried
to steal from us is forfeit.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.080
Now get the hell
out of here.

28:36.082 --> 28:36.747
No.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.315
Excuse me?

28:40.219 --> 28:44.254
I'll take my money
and then i'll leave.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.090
You misunderstand,
sweetheart.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.226
You don't get a choice.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.006
[android]
you found a buyer.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.808
[corso]
yep.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.310
And you secured
a fair price?

29:06.312 --> 29:08.412
Un huh.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.513
I'd caution against transporting
that through a secured area.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.849
Guests are forbidden

29:11.851 --> 29:13.250
From carrying weapons
onto the station.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.002
Don't worry about it.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.753
If anyone asks,
i'll just say it's drugs.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.890
I suspect that would
prove equally problematic.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.392
You've done something
new with your hair.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.094
It suits you.

29:25.831 --> 29:26.830
I want my money.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.398
That cash is forfeit.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.434
Now this can go
one of two ways.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.504
You can walk through that exit,
or we'll carry you out.

29:33.506 --> 29:34.772
[five]
we didn't cheat.

29:34.774 --> 29:35.305
Shut up.

this means don't you?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.586
Yeah, you're going to have
to wait on that curvy redhead?

30:22.588 --> 30:24.855
It was you.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.857
You're the one who
wiped our memories clean.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.859
And you based this
assumption on what exactly?

30:28.861 --> 30:31.829
How about the fact that
you're an impostor and a liar?

30:31.831 --> 30:33.397
And you're a
murderer and a thief

30:33.399 --> 30:34.965
Who gives his guns pet names.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.533
You lied to get
onto our ship.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.235
Which means you were
after something

30:38.237 --> 30:40.537
You didn't want the rest
of us to know about.

30:40.539 --> 30:44.007
I'm sure i wasn't the only one
that ship with a hidden agenda.

30:44.009 --> 30:47.578
And whatever it was i was after,
i'm also sure it was a lot more

30:47.580 --> 30:50.113
Interesting than just screwing
with everyone's memories.

30:50.115 --> 30:50.848
Hey.

30:50.850 --> 30:51.894
What?

30:51.895 --> 30:52.939
I've got an idea.

30:52.940 --> 30:53.984
Ugh, what did i say
about your ideas?

30:53.986 --> 30:54.952
Look, we've got
to get out of here

30:54.953 --> 30:55.919
Before he comes
back and kills us.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.187
He's not gonna kill us.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.455
He's gonna
sell our stuff

30:58.457 --> 31:00.290
And he's gonna hightail
it out of here.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.643
Oh really?

31:02.644 --> 31:04.995
Is that what you'd
do if you were him?

31:04.997 --> 31:05.863
What's your plan?

31:05.865 --> 31:07.481
These wires are metal.

31:07.482 --> 31:09.098
If we can get close enough
to that table for me to grab

31:09.101 --> 31:11.401
That shock stick,
i might be able go use it

31:11.403 --> 31:13.136
To soften them up enough
for us to break free.

31:13.138 --> 31:14.905
We'll there's a couple
problems with that,

31:14.907 --> 31:16.406
The biggest being,
it's gonna hurt.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.941
A lot.

Are you saying you can't
tough it out like i can?

31:19.478 --> 31:20.944
Ugh, let's
just do this.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.279
Alright.

At the count of
three, we shift.

localized damage,

Are you experiencing
any other discomfort?

32:13.532 --> 32:14.431
Nope.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.033
When did this happen?

a few minutes.

some ointment, or something.

It was a tilt.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.376
We have to go.

35:13.378 --> 35:13.677
One.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.544
Three.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.046
We have a situation here

35:16.047 --> 35:17.547
We need you back to
the ship immediately.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.415
Please respond.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.550
Given the circumstances,

35:19.551 --> 35:20.684
Perhaps we should consider
leaving them behind.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.453
We can't.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.221
Three made it clear he
intended to go his own way.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.355
[two]
he's all talk.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.357
Besides, if he was
actually going to leave,

35:27.359 --> 35:29.693
He would have made
a bigger deal about it.

35:29.695 --> 35:30.694
Subtle he is not.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.462
And what if they
sold the weapons

35:32.464 --> 35:34.531
And decided to keep
the money for themselves?

35:34.533 --> 35:36.500
No, no.

35:36.502 --> 35:37.767
Three maybe.

35:37.769 --> 35:38.635
Hell, probably.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.736
But one?

35:39.738 --> 35:40.704
No way.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.539
He may not
have had a choice.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.175
He could have been deceived,
or rendered unconscious,

35:45.177 --> 35:46.610
Perhaps even killed.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.344
One.

35:47.346 --> 35:47.911
Three.

35:47.912 --> 35:48.477
This is two.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.446
Please respond.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.715
[one and three screaming in pai]

35:51.717 --> 35:53.650
There's gotta
be another way.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.651
I think they're
weakening.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.652
Okay just hang on.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.620
Just one more.

35:56.622 --> 35:57.621
Hang on, hang on.

35:57.623 --> 35:58.688
Just let me catch my--

35:58.690 --> 36:00.757
[one and three screaming]

36:03.929 --> 36:07.464
[corso] it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.699
There's just one more
thing i need to take care of.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.767
[gun clicks]

36:18.477 --> 36:20.410
Is something the matter?

36:27.886 --> 36:30.787
One, three, answer me.

36:30.789 --> 36:34.324
[sirens wailing]

36:34.326 --> 36:35.592
[five]
what is that?

36:35.594 --> 36:37.594
It's the space
station's security alarm.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.196
Oh damn it.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.931
Get us out of here.

36:40.933 --> 36:51.241
[sirens continue wailing]

36:51.243 --> 36:59.216
[sirens continue wailing]

37:09.294 --> 37:11.695
I'll prepare the coordinates
for a jump to ftl.

37:12.397 --> 37:12.796
[one]
go!

37:12.798 --> 37:13.663
We gotta go!

37:13.665 --> 37:14.764
Is everyone here?!

37:14.766 --> 37:16.533
We're already
on our way, one.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.018
[three panting]
we noticed.

37:18.019 --> 37:19.502
[two] why the hell weren't
you answering your comms?

37:19.504 --> 37:20.804
We were gonna
leave without you.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.739
We lost them.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.542
How?

37:25.544 --> 37:27.577
How much did you
get for the weapons?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.578
Nothing.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.347
Nothing?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.317
Where are they?

37:34.319 --> 37:36.486
They're gone.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.989
We were--

37:38.991 --> 37:41.658
[three] jumped,
by a half dozen men.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.760
Yeah, he got knocked out,
played dead.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.528
So i took the rest on myself.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.765
I was doing alright too until
the seventh guy, he snuck up

37:48.767 --> 37:51.768
Behind me and clocked me
right in the head, i went down.

37:51.770 --> 37:55.805
We lost our comms and all the g.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.308
Is that really
how it happened?

37:58.310 --> 38:00.677
More or less.

38:00.679 --> 38:05.982
I couldn't see everything
because i was down on the floor.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.617
Yeah.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.687
With my eyes closed.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.055
Hmm.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.328
Yeah, as much as i'd love
to hear the rest of this story,

38:18.330 --> 38:20.063
We've got more
important things to do--

38:20.065 --> 38:23.566
Like getting
the hell out of here.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.635
Jumping to ftl.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.496
Jace corso.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.098
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.366
Don't call me that.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.703
No, hmm what
do you prefer?

38:59.705 --> 39:00.970
One.

39:00.972 --> 39:08.611
One, okay one.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.046
What can i do for you?

39:10.048 --> 39:12.749
How about you tell me
why you covered for me?

39:12.751 --> 39:14.751
Why didn't you tell them
what really happened

39:14.753 --> 39:16.636
At the space station?

39:16.637 --> 39:18.520
How do you think the rest
of the crew will react

39:18.523 --> 39:20.090
When they find out that
you're an impostor?

39:20.092 --> 39:22.559
And that you're most
probably the guy who screwed

39:22.561 --> 39:23.827
With all of our memories?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.528
I didn't screw with
anyone's memories.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.097
You can't be sure
though can you?

39:27.099 --> 39:28.798
People are gonna
make educated guesses.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.501
And when they do...

39:31.503 --> 39:32.569
Hmm.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.537
What do you think?

39:34.539 --> 39:37.540
They gonna stuff you in
the airlock and space you?

39:37.542 --> 39:39.542
They could abandon you
on a barren planet

39:39.544 --> 39:41.544
To freeze your ass off.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.545
Or i'm thinking maybe--

39:42.547 --> 39:44.881
What do you want?

39:44.883 --> 39:48.485
I just want your
support moving forward.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.455
Crew votes, debates,
lunch decisions.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.391
You follow my lead.

40:01.500 --> 40:05.101
From here on in,
we agree to agree.

40:20.051 --> 40:23.153
Hey.

40:23.155 --> 40:24.888
Hey.

40:32.898 --> 40:36.032
We should talk about what
happened on the space station.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.802
That's ok.

40:38.804 --> 40:39.969
I really think--

40:39.971 --> 40:42.906
I don't wanna talk about it.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.947
What's wrong with her?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.916
Nothing.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.851
She's perfectly normal.

40:54.853 --> 40:59.189
Which is a problem
on this ship.

41:01.860 --> 41:05.528
So, i've been doing
the math in my head

41:05.530 --> 41:10.567
And correct me if i'm wrong
but... We managed to refuel,

41:10.569 --> 41:14.003
But didn't have time to effect
repairs or resupply and restock.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.973
We lost the weapons, so we
didn't get anything for 'em.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.742
We sold the other stuff
and did get money for it,

41:19.744 --> 41:21.811
But it was confiscated
at the casino.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.980
[two sighs]

41:23.982 --> 41:29.786
So, bottom line: We're worse off
than we were 24 hours ago.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.155
We also missed an opportunity
to do some research

41:32.157 --> 41:35.892
While we had access to
the station's information hub.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.894
Maybe next time.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.829
Yeah.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.798
For now, we're back
to square one,

41:41.800 --> 41:44.868
And our pasts
remain a mystery.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.672
[news anchor] the fallout from
the assassination of emperor iso

41:49.674 --> 41:53.176
Continues to be felt
throughout c sector as forces

41:53.178 --> 41:55.945
From the principality of
zairon and the neighboring

41:55.947 --> 41:58.882
Republic of pyr
remain on war footing.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.150
Several multi-corps
have dispatched destroyers

42:01.152 --> 42:04.053
To the disputed region to
safeguard transit passages.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.590
Representatives of
the galactic authority say theyr

42:07.592 --> 42:12.061
Humanitarian aid to refugees
fleeing the area but, thus far,

42:12.063 --> 42:14.063
Have characterized the standoffs

42:14.065 --> 42:17.934
"a regional conflict between
two independent territories"

42:17.936 --> 42:22.171
And dismissed the possibility
of direct military involvement.

42:22.173 --> 42:25.708
Meanwhile, the search continues
for emperor ishida's murderer,

42:25.710 --> 42:30.079
Purported to be his own
son, crown prince ishida ryo.

42:30.081 --> 42:33.016
Since the emperor's death,
the crown prince has been implid

42:33.018 --> 42:36.886
In the deaths and disfigurements
of almost 100 people.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.721
He is on the run
and is considered

42:38.723 --> 42:42.692
Armed, unstable,
and extremely dangerous.
