DETECTIVE AGENCY.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.040
[CLAIRE] YOU GONNA GET IT?

00:47.290 --> 00:49.050
[JAKE] SORT OF IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.220
[CLAIRE] IT'S A
LITTLE DISTRACTING.

01:00.430 --> 01:03.310
[JAKE] WHAT?
[MARK] I THINK SHE'S INSIDE WITH

01:03.350 --> 01:05.810
SOMEONE. I LEFT WORK,

01:05.850 --> 01:08.150
[JAKE] WHERE ARE YOU?
[MARK] IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

01:08.190 --> 01:10.530
[JAKE] OKAY LISTEN TO ME,
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GO IN

01:10.570 --> 01:12.690

YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE AREN'T YOU?

01:18.740 --> 01:22.330
[MARK] YEAH, HOW DID YOU KNOW?
[JAKE] CALL IT A PI'S

01:22.370 --> 01:24.120
INTUITION.
[CLAIRE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:24.160 --> 01:25.410
[JAKE] NOTHING, IT'S WORK.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.330
UM.. LISTEN, YOU DON'T WANNA
GO IN THERE MAN.

01:27.380 --> 01:30.300
[CLAIRE] &lt;SCREAMS&gt;
[JAKE] THIS UM, THIS ISN'T WHAT

01:30.340 --> 01:31.550
IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:31.590 --> 01:36.680
[MARK] YOU?!
[JAKE] OKAY, I KNOW THIS LOOKS

01:36.720 --> 01:38.340
LIKE YOU HIRED ME TO SLEEP
WITH YOUR WIFE.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.560
[CLAIRE] HE HIRED YOU?
[JAKE] BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY

01:40.600 --> 01:42.930
ONE SLEEPING WITH HER.
[CLAIRE] YOU HIRED SOMEONE TO

01:42.970 --> 01:44.140
SPY ON ME?

01:44.180 --> 01:46.560
[JAKE] YOU WON'T BE BILLED FOR
TODAY. YOU KNOW I GOT A CRAZY

01:46.600 --> 01:50.610
FEELING YOU KIDS COULD JUST--
[CLAIRE] STOP IT!

01:50.650 --> 01:52.530

01:54.490 --> 01:56.490
[MARK] GET OFF OF ME!

01:59.410 --> 02:01.030

02:01.080 --> 02:03.290
START THE VAN DAD.

02:03.330 --> 02:04.750
START THE VAN DAD!

02:04.790 --> 02:07.790
&lt;♪♪&gt;

02:15.340 --> 02:17.340
[MALACHY] THIS IS THE MOST
UNPROFESSIONAL THING

02:17.380 --> 02:19.300
I'VE SEEN IN 20 YEARS
JAKE DOYLE.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.350
[JAKE] YEAH, IT'S UP THERE.

02:22.390 --> 02:24.350
DID YOU CASH THE CHEQUE YET?

02:24.390 --> 02:27.140
&lt;♪♪&gt;

02:46.410 --> 02:49.620
[MALACHY] THE INVESTIGATION
INTO THE FIRE AT JAPAR WAS
CLOSED A MONTH AGO, MIRANDA.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.340
IF THE POLICE RULED IT WAS AN
ACCIDENT, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE CAN PROVE ANY DIFFERENT.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.340
[MIRANDA] WELL MALACHY, YOU
KNOW AL KAVANAGH.

02:55.380 --> 02:56.510
[TONY] I'M SORRY,
HOLD ON A SECOND NOW.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.300
ARE WE KEEPING YOU UP?

02:58.340 --> 03:00.050
[JAKE] OH, SORRY.

03:00.090 --> 03:04.100
SORRY, I HAD A CLIENT RIDE ME
PRETTY HARD LAST NIGHT.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.310
[MIRANDA] MAL, YOU KNOW
AL KAVANAGH.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.350
[JAKE] LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
AL KAVANAGH ALL RIGHT.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.980
HE OWNS GEORGE STREET.
[TONY] HALF.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.770
[MIRANDA] AND I OWN
THE OTHER HALF,

03:14.820 --> 03:17.780
AND I'M POSITIVE THAT HE PUT
THE TORCH TO MY BEST BAR

03:17.820 --> 03:19.400
AND I WANT YOU TO PROVE IT.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.200
[TINNY] SORRY TO
INTERRUPT, I'M OFF.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.410
[MALACHY] HAVE A GREAT DAY
AT SCHOOL, SWEETIE.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.450
[TINNY] LUNCH?

03:24.490 --> 03:26.790
[MIRANDA] DIDN'T I SEE YOU DOWN
AT MY BAR THE OTHER NIGHT?

03:26.830 --> 03:28.790
[TINNY] I DON'T THINK SO.
[MALACHY] YOU BETTER NOT HAVE.

03:28.830 --> 03:32.750
[JAKE] HERE, DON'T WORRY,
I ROB IT FROM YOUR PAPIS WALLET.

03:32.790 --> 03:33.750
GO ON NOW, SCATTER.

03:33.790 --> 03:36.800
[TINNY] THANKS UNCLE JAKE.
LATER PAPI.

03:38.630 --> 03:39.880
[MALACHY] MIRANDA,

03:39.920 --> 03:43.510
WE INVESTIGATE FRAUD ALL THE
TIME. MOST TIMES--

03:43.550 --> 03:46.350
[JAKE] IT'S THE OWNER THAT'S
THE GUILTY PARTY.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.060
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.270
WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING
TO GET FROM THE INSURANCE
PAYOUT MIRANDA?

03:49.310 --> 03:53.190
300, 350 GRAND,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

03:53.230 --> 03:56.270
[MIRANDA] MAL, WHY WOULD
I BURN DOWN MY OWN BEST BAR?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.280
IT'S BEEN TURNING
A PROFIT FOR YEARS.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.450
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A
RENOVATION FOR GOD SAKES.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.160
[TONY] WHY ARE WE TALKING
TO THIS COUPLE OF TOOLS?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.490
BABY LOOK I TOLD YOU,
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

04:04.530 --> 04:05.700
I CAN DEAL WITH AL
KAVANAGH, MYSELF.

04:05.740 --> 04:09.250
[MIRANDA] TONY, MAL IS
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.620
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN
PROFIT FROM HIS EXPERIENCE.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.830
[MALACHY] THERE WAS A YOUNG
GIRL WHO DIED IN THAT FIRE,

04:14.880 --> 04:16.840
WASN'T THERE?
[MIRANDA] YES. DEBBIE SIMMS,

04:16.880 --> 04:19.460
IT WAS TRAGIC. MAL I THINK
IF YOU PUT A TAIL ON AL--

04:19.510 --> 04:23.260
[MALACHY] LOOK WE HAVE TO
DISCUSS A FEW THINGS AND THEN,

04:23.300 --> 04:26.550
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
[TONY] TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.430
[JAKE] NICE TO MEET YOU TONY.

04:28.470 --> 04:31.100
GOOD TO SEE YA 'FELLA WORKING
OUT HIS MOTHER ISSUES.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.440
[MIRANDA] REALLY GOOD TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.570

04:38.610 --> 04:40.190
[MALACHY] NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN TOO.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.610
[MIRANDA] NICE TO SEE YOU
LANDED ON YOUR FEET.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.200
[MIRANDA] JAKE.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.880
[MALACHY] WHAT WAS THAT
LITTLE SYMPHONY ABOUT?

04:55.920 --> 04:59.090
[ROSE] I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
MEAN. HOW IS MIRANDA CAHILL?

04:59.130 --> 05:01.300
[JAKE] WELL, SHE WANTS TO
STICK A DAGGER DOWN KAVANAGH,

05:01.340 --> 05:02.300
I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

05:02.340 --> 05:03.510
[ROSE] CAN'T FAULT HER THERE,
I SUPPOSE.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.510
[MALACHY] JAKE, I'M GETTING
TIRED WITH YOU.

05:05.550 --> 05:07.010
FIRST THIS WITH A CLIENT'S WIFE.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.430
[JAKE] WHAT ABOUT THIS, WITH
YOU AND YOUR EX GIRLFRIEND?

05:08.470 --> 05:10.060
[MALACHY] SHE WASN'T MY
GIRLFRIEND, WE DATED,

05:10.100 --> 05:11.600
YEARS AGO. THAT'S ALL.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.100
[ROSE] I'M MUCH BETTER LOOKING.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.770
[MALACHY] INDEED YOU ARE,
MY LOVE.

05:14.810 --> 05:15.810
[ROSE] MY LOVE.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.900
[JAKE] I'LL MEET YOU IN THE CAR.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.490
[ROSE] SHE IS TROUBLE MALACHY,

05:22.530 --> 05:24.360
AND I'D SAY THAT WHETHER
YOU DATED OR NOT.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.910
[MALACHY] LOOK, WE DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS CASE.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.910
IT CAN BE YOUR CALL.
I DON'T NEED IT.

05:27.950 --> 05:31.080
[ROSE] NO? WELL THE NEW TRUCK
YOU WANNA BUY, SAYS OTHERWISE.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.910
TAKE IT, DON'T TAKE IT.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.960
YOUR CALL MAL.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.550
&lt;♪♪&gt;

05:42.590 --> 05:44.550
[LESLIE] NOW, NOW, PLAY NICE.
I'M KIND OF BUSY.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.380
[JAKE] C'MON CONSTABLE, PLEASE?

05:46.430 --> 05:48.140
[LESLIE] THERE WAS A FULL
INVESTIGATION, THE FIRE WAS

05:48.180 --> 05:51.510
LISTED AS AN ACCIDENT.
[MALACHY] WHAT STARTED IT?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.470
[LESLIE] THEY WERE RENOVATING
THE BAR BASEMENT AND USING

05:53.520 --> 05:55.690
KEROSENE HEATERS TO DRY THE
PLASTER. SOME PANELING CAUGHT

05:55.730 --> 05:57.480
FIRE, THE KEROSENE DID THE
REST.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.020
[MALACHY] WHAT ABOUT THE YOUNG
GIRL?

05:59.060 --> 06:01.820
[LESLIE] SHE TESTED POSITIVE
FOR COCAINE. BUT THE CAUSE OF

06:01.860 --> 06:03.190
DEATH WAS SMOKE INHALATION.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.610
COKE OR SMOKE GUYS,
TAKE YOUR PICK.

06:04.650 --> 06:07.410
[JAKE] DEBBIE, SHE WORKED FOR
KAVANAGH, RIGHT? DIDN'T SEEM

06:07.450 --> 06:10.410
STRANGE TO YOU THAT ONE OF
KAVANAGH'S EMPLOYEES WAS FOUND

06:10.450 --> 06:11.200
DEAD IN MIRANDA CAHILL'S

06:11.240 --> 06:12.660
BASEMENT?IRANDA CAHILL'S

06:12.700 --> 06:14.410
[LESLIE] AL KAVANAGH IS NO
SAINT. BUT HE DOESN'T STAND

06:14.450 --> 06:16.410
FOR DRUGS IN HIS BARS EITHER.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.080
[DAN] HEY GENTLEMEN,
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:19.130 --> 06:20.540
THANK YOU CONSTABLE.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.340
[LESLIE] WORD IS, EVERY BAR
WORKER WITH A HABIT HEADED

06:22.380 --> 06:26.420
FOR THAT BASEMENT.
[DAN] THANK YOU, CONSTABLE.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.680
NOW LOOK BOYS, YOU GOT THREE
MINUTES WITH THAT FILE.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.220
OKAY?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.640
[JAKE] YOU GOT IT, DAN.
[MALACHY] THANKS DAN,

06:32.680 --> 06:33.970
WE OWE YOU.

06:34.010 --> 06:37.440
[DAN] YEAH DOYLE,
ANOTHER PINT YOU'LL NEVER BUY.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.850
[JAKE] I THINK HE MEANS THREE
MINUTES.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.650
[MALACHY] ONLY THREE YEARS
OLDER THAN TINNY.

06:42.690 --> 06:46.440
[JAKE] YEAH. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
TAKING THE CASE, EH?

06:46.490 --> 06:47.570
WHAT ABOUT ROSE, IS SHE OKAY
WITH IT?

06:47.610 --> 06:48.780
[MALACHY] SHE'S FINE WITH IT.

06:48.820 --> 06:52.280
[JAKE] OH YEAH, SHE TOLD YOU
THAT, DID SHE?

06:52.330 --> 06:54.910
I'M SURE IT'S TRUE.

06:54.950 --> 06:59.580
[JAKE] ALL RIGHT, HERE IS WHAT
WE GOT. OUR DUCHESS OF GEORGE

06:59.620 --> 07:03.670
MIRANDA CAHILL, AKA MAL'S EX
GIRLFRIEND HAS ACCUSED AL

07:03.710 --> 07:09.380
KAVANAGH OF TORCHING HER BAR.
[MALACHY] THESE TWO HAVE BEEN

07:09.430 --> 07:10.840
AT EACH OTHER'S THROAT FOR
YEARS.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.680
[JAKE] EVERYTHING FROM PETTY
VANDALISM, TO OUT RIGHT BRAWLS

07:13.720 --> 07:15.850
ON THE STREET.
[MALACHY] WHAT DO WE GOT ON

07:15.890 --> 07:18.180
KAVANAGH?
[ROSE] WELL, HE'S BEEN BUSY

07:18.230 --> 07:20.650
IMPROVING HIMSELF FOR THE LAST
WHILE. HE IS ON EVERY CHARITY

07:20.690 --> 07:23.980
YOU CAN THINK OF, MOVES IN ALL
THE FANCY CIRCLES AND HE JUST

07:24.020 --> 07:26.030
GOT A REGULAR 7AM AT CLOVELLY
GOLF CLUB.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.190
[JAKE] HEY DES, STOP TWITTERING
YOURSELF AND PAY ATTENTION.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.660
[DES] CLOVELLY MEMBERSHIP FEES
ARE LIKE 8G'S A YEAR.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.910
[MALACHY] WOW!

07:31.950 --> 07:34.870
MIRANDA WANTS TO PROVE KAVANAGH
IS RESPONSIBLE.

07:34.910 --> 07:37.450
[JAKE] THIS FIRE WAS OVER A
MONTH AGO. SO THE TRAIL IS

07:37.500 --> 07:40.120
GONNA BE COLD. I SAY WE START
WITH OUR DEAD GIRL AND HER

07:40.160 --> 07:45.000
FAMILY.
[ROXANNE] THEY TOLD YOU ABOUT

07:45.040 --> 07:47.420
DEBBIE AND THE DRUGS?
[MALACHY] IT WAS IN THE REPORT,

07:47.460 --> 07:48.920
YEAH.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.680
[ROXANNE] SHE JUST STARTED
GETTING REAL DISTANT, STARTED

07:51.720 --> 07:54.510
STAYING OUT LATER AND LATER.

07:54.550 --> 07:58.310
WHEN THE POLICE WERE HERE,
I COULDN'T GET TWO WORDS OUT.

07:58.350 --> 08:00.980
[MALACHY] I'M SURE THEY'RE THE
WORST AT CONVERSATION ANYWAY,

08:01.020 --> 08:04.690
I SHOULD KNOW. I WAS ONE.

08:04.730 --> 08:07.570
ROXANNE, WAS DEBBIE INVOLVED
WITH ANYONE?

08:07.610 --> 08:09.740
[ROXANNE] SHE WAS PRIVATE, IF
SHE HADN'T OF BEEN SO PRIVATE,

08:09.780 --> 08:11.900
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP
HER OUT WITH THE DRUGS AND

08:11.950 --> 08:14.450
THAT.
[JAKE] WHERE DID YOU GET THE

08:14.490 --> 08:18.240
PAINING? IT'S NICE.
[ROXANNE] DEBBIE DID THAT FOR

08:18.290 --> 08:20.910
ME. SHE'D STAY OUT THERE FOR
HOURS, DRAWING WHEN SHE WAS

08:20.960 --> 08:25.540
LITTLE. HER HEAD ALWAYS IN HER
SCRIBBLER, OR ON THE WALLS,

08:25.580 --> 08:27.710
I WAS FOREVER WASHING THEM
WALLS.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.800
[JAKE] IS THIS HER STUFF HERE?

08:29.840 --> 08:32.970
DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A LOOK?

08:33.010 --> 08:38.560
[ROXANNE] GO AHEAD.
[JAKE] SHE WAS GOOD,

08:38.600 --> 08:39.770
SHE WAS TALENTED.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.980
[ROXANNE] YOU THINK SO? COUPLE
OF MONTHS AGO SHE CAUGHT ME AT

08:42.020 --> 08:44.400
THAT PILE, CLEANING, YOU KNOW.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.690
WELL SHE WAS POISONED WITH ME,
CAUSE I SAW THEM. DRAWING ALL

08:47.730 --> 08:50.030
THOSE PICTURES, ALL THOSE
YEARS, AND NEVER SHOWED A

08:50.070 --> 08:52.740
SOUL.
[JAKE] SHE NEVER SHOWED

08:52.780 --> 08:58.660
ANYONE, LIKE HER BOYFRIENDS OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

08:58.700 --> 09:02.660
ROXANNE, I KNOW THAT THE COPS
HAVE BEEN THROUGH HERE, AND

09:02.710 --> 09:05.580
THEY'VE ASKED YOU ALL THESE
QUESTIONS BEFORE. BUT,

09:05.620 --> 09:10.250
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN THINK OF, ANYTHING
YOU MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN?

09:12.090 --> 09:15.840
[ROXANNE] THERE WAS A CALL.

09:15.890 --> 09:19.350
HER VOICE WAS NERVOUS.

09:19.390 --> 09:22.640
THIS MAN MADE HER NERVOUS,
HE WAS AN OLDER MAN.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.730
COULD HAVE BEEN A BOYFRIEND,
I DIDN'T ASK. I DIDN'T WANT TO

09:25.770 --> 09:28.860
START ANOTHER FIGHT OR
SOMETHING YOU KNOW.

09:28.900 --> 09:32.440
[JAKE] WELL, THANKS FOR
LETTING ME SEE THESE.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.030
THEY'RE VERY NICE.

09:34.070 --> 09:37.320
[ROXANNE] KILLS ME EVERY TIME
I SEE THAT. I CAN'T BARE HAVING

09:37.370 --> 09:39.740
IT AROUND. CAN'T THROW IT OUT
EITHER.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.200
[JAKE] MAYBE WE CAN HOLD ON TO
IT FOR YOU, UNTIL YOU FEEL

09:42.240 --> 09:45.870
LIKE YOU'RE READY TO LOOK AT
IT AGAIN.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.830
[JAKE] OLDER BOYFRIEND, YOU
THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.920
[MALACHY] AL KAVANAGH IS A BAG
OF DOG FEECES, HE COULD HAVE

09:49.960 --> 09:51.550
RUINED THAT GIRL EASILY AND
LET HER BURN.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.630
[JAKE] C'MON DAD, IT'S A BIT
CONVENIENT, YOU KNOW. YOU SURE

09:53.670 --> 09:55.550
YOU'RE NOT STILL HOLDING A
FLAME FOR THE OLD DUCHESS?

09:55.590 --> 09:56.630
TRYING TO PROTECT HER, MAYBE?

09:56.680 --> 09:59.300
[MALACHY] YOU'RE THE ONE WHO

SAYING SHE MIGHT TRY AND

21:06.470 --> 21:07.430
INCRIMINATE AL, THAT'S ALL.

21:07.470 --> 21:10.470
I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
ALL THE ANGLES,

21:10.520 --> 21:11.430
NOT JUST THE ONES WE LIKE.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.270
[TINNY] LIKE HOW SOMEONE
MIGHT BE GENUINELY LATE

21:14.310 --> 21:16.480
FOR A GOOD REASON INSTEAD OF
JUST TO BREAK THE RULES?

21:16.520 --> 21:17.650
[MALACHY] YOU'RE STILL GROUNDED.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.070
[TINNY] FINE, WHATEVER.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.110
[JAKE] CAN WE FOCUS
HERE, PLEASE?

21:21.150 --> 21:23.610
DAD, I THINK WE NEED TO DIG A
LITTLE DEEPER INTO MIRANDA.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.530
I DON'T TRUST HER AS FAR AS
I CAN THROW HER.

21:25.570 --> 21:27.740
ESPECIALLY IF SHE DID BURN
DOWN KAVANAGH'S HOUSE.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.580
[ROSE] I LOOKED INTO SOME
RECENT REAL ESTATE DEALS ON

21:29.620 --> 21:31.870
GEORGE STREET, THERE IS AN
EMPTY LOT NEXT TO MIRANDA'S

21:31.910 --> 21:33.250
BAR THAT JUST CHANGED HANDS.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.870
BUT IT'S A NUMBERED COMPANY
REGISTERS TO A FAKE NAME.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.340
[MALACHY] RIGHT,
BUT WHAT IS YOUR POINT?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.420
[ROSE] I'M INVESTIGATING!

23:41.040 --> 23:45.500

23:45.550 --> 23:46.710
[TONY] WHAT DO YOU WANT, BOSS?

23:46.760 --> 23:50.340

[JAKE] YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT
YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH HIM

23:54.850 --> 23:56.600
10 YEARS AGO WHEN
YOU BURNED HIS HOUSE DOWN.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.140
[TONY] WHAT'S HE

23:59.180 --> 24:02.650
[MIRANDA] MAL, YOU KNOW

NOT SO MUCH WHEN I WAS WITH YOU.
BUT I WAS DRINKING HEAVY AND,

24:05.520 --> 24:09.440

A FEW LAPSES IN JUDGMENT.

24:09.490 --> 24:10.530
[TONY] LAPSES, LIKE AL KAVANAGH?

24:10.570 --> 24:13.450
[MIRANDA] YEAH, AND MAYBE SOME

PROUD OF FROM MY PAST. BUT
NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAVE

24:16.240 --> 24:18.700

[MALACHY] KAVANAGH'S
HOUSE BURNING DOWN MIRANDA.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.550
YOU HAVE A PART TO PLAY
IN THAT?

24:31.590 --> 24:34.550
[MIRANDA] IS MY MONEY PAYING
FOR ANYTHING BESIDE INSULT AND

24:34.590 --> 24:36.140

[JAKE] THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR DEVELOPMENT DEAL

35:05.730 --> 35:08.310
FIRST YOU BUY THE LOT NEXT
TO MIRANDA CAHILL,

35:08.350 --> 35:11.730
AND THEN A LITTLE ARSON WILL
HELP YOU CLEAR OUT GEORGE ST.
ALL FOR YOURSELF.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.940
SOUNDS LIKE A MOTIVE TO ME.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.740

35:46.310 --> 35:47.770
YOU STILL GOT NO MANNERS?

35:47.810 --> 35:51.350
AND YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
[ARTHUR] YOU MEAN FATHER LIAM?

35:51.400 --> 35:54.070
I TOOK HIS TEA TIME.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.360
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

35:55.400 --> 35:58.190
[AL] ARTHUR HERE IS ON THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE

35:58.240 --> 36:00.450
SMILING LAND FOUNDATION. HE
WAS HELPING ME PICK UP A SEAT

36:00.490 --> 36:04.490
ON THE BOARD, SO I HELP HIM

36:07.750 --> 36:11.290
[LESLIE] JAKE, OUT, NOW!

36:11.330 --> 36:12.290

36:12.330 --> 36:14.340
HONEST TO GOD.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.130
I MEAN IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR LAND, YOU LOOK CLOSER TO

36:16.170 --> 36:18.630
HOME, WILL YOU?
[FINN] DOYLE, DOYLE YOUR DAD

36:18.670 --> 36:21.380
STILL OWES ME THAT 20 BUCKS.
[MALACHY] FINN SAID THE PARTNER

36:21.430 --> 36:23.590
WAS A BAR OWNER.
[JAKE] WHAT WAS THAT CRAP

36:23.640 --> 36:27.010
KAVANAGH WAS GETTING ON WITH
ABOUT BEING CLOSER TO HOME?

36:27.060 --> 36:29.390
[MALACHY] I DON'T KNOW.
EITHER WAY, WE GOT NOTHING.

36:29.430 --> 36:31.390
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THE BAR BURNT.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.190
[JAKE] AND WHY IT HAS TO DO WITH
A LAND DEAL, OR WHY DEBBIE DIED!

36:35.900 --> 36:36.690
OR ANYTHING.

36:36.730 --> 36:38.400
[MALACHY] JAKE.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.200

37:12.230 --> 37:17.940

SOMEWHERE.

37:17.980 --> 37:21.110
[MALACHY] IS TODAY THE DAY TO
BREAK THE PLEDGE?

37:21.150 --> 37:22.740

37:22.780 --> 37:26.030
I DONE PRETTY GOOD AND MADE A
BUNCH OF MONEY BUT I COULD

37:26.070 --> 37:30.290

37:30.330 --> 37:33.710
[MALACHY] MIRANDA, I HAVE TO
ASK YOU, ARE YOU IN BED WITH

37:33.750 --> 37:35.250
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?

37:35.290 --> 37:36.630
I MEAN, A LAND DEAL?

37:36.670 --> 37:40.380
[MIRANDA] OH, THAT. THAT'S
DEAD, NOT EVEN THE HOLY ROMAN

37:40.420 --> 37:43.420
CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC CHURCH
WANTS TO CRAWL INTO BED WITH A

37:43.470 --> 37:46.430
SCUMBAG BAR OWNER.
[MALACHY] SO THE SECRECY,

38:47.400 --> 38:50.570
BREAKING THAT WAY,

38:50.620 --> 38:52.620

39:10.180 --> 39:15.060
[TONY] SHE LOVES ME TOO,

39:52.050 --> 39:54.510
WHY DIDN'T IT EVER WORK OUT

39:54.560 --> 39:57.560
