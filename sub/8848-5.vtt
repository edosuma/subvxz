00:32.414 --> 00:35.091
It is good to make
this sacrifice

00:35.216 --> 00:38.705
where the sun can
look down and see you.

00:40.087 --> 00:44.753
It is a great privilege
to dance with the sun.

00:46.494 --> 00:48.770
The sacrifice will be hard,

00:48.895 --> 00:52.063
but you are strong... and brave.

01:01.170 --> 01:03.251
You will not give up,

01:03.376 --> 01:05.385
as I did not give up

01:05.510 --> 01:08.679
when my father brought
me to this place.

01:12.518 --> 01:14.285
Ah.

01:29.933 --> 01:35.137
Follow the sun...
All day and pray.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.472
If you are strong and true,

01:37.638 --> 01:40.752
your sacrifice will be rewarded

01:40.877 --> 01:43.311
and you will have a vision.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.113
Ahem.

03:20.404 --> 03:21.952
Ma'am.

03:22.118 --> 03:25.083
It's not your manners, Mr. Bohannon.

03:25.208 --> 03:26.414
It's your manner.

03:27.678 --> 03:28.834
Beg your pardon?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.888
Yesterday...

03:31.013 --> 03:32.712
When everyone was running
from the disaster...

03:32.878 --> 03:35.257
You walked calmly in.

03:36.786 --> 03:41.596
You are their hero, Mr. Bohannon.

03:41.762 --> 03:43.306
Lily!

03:43.472 --> 03:44.669
I just heard from your father.

03:44.794 --> 03:46.017
Everything is arranged.

03:52.501 --> 03:54.317
I'm assuming you're here to see me?

03:54.483 --> 03:56.580
Yes, sir, um...

03:56.705 --> 03:59.249
Payroll didn't come in
on the train this morning.

03:59.374 --> 04:01.617
Mr. Bohannon, one
of the reasons I spared

04:01.742 --> 04:03.886
your neck was because
I thought you were a capable man.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.245
Was I mistaken?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.922
No, sir, but the men
are already grumbling

04:07.047 --> 04:09.040
about not getting their
pay last week, sir.

04:09.206 --> 04:11.418
Well, see the Swede about petty cash.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.171
Mr. Durant, uh, that
won't cover the men's pay.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.998
Of course not, you idiot.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.257
It's for the walking bosses,

04:18.825 --> 04:20.202
but keep quiet about it.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.137
We don't want a riot on our hands.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.439
Just keep the men in line

04:24.564 --> 04:26.725
until you get your money
troubles sorted out.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.378
My problems are no concern of yours,
Mr. Bohannon.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.398
Actually, today Mr. Durant,
your troubles are mine.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.861
But y'all go have yourselves
a nice picnic, all right?

04:50.254 --> 04:55.003
Reverend... I can find someone
else to help with this.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.298
Just a moment to catch my breath.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.740
Whoo-yah! Yah!

05:04.435 --> 05:06.669
Get the hell out of the way.

05:15.278 --> 05:19.382
We need to ride out and speak
to many horses immediately.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.073
My father's people won't
feel threatened by 4 men.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.630
Well, these men are the
eyes of the Union Army,

05:25.755 --> 05:27.698
the tip of the spear.

05:27.823 --> 05:31.039
Let's go.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.372
Business has been slow, Mr. Swede.

05:34.497 --> 05:35.706
We will pay ya though.

05:35.831 --> 05:37.003
Yeah.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.173
We just need a little more time.

05:41.503 --> 05:44.180
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

05:44.305 --> 05:50.016
Thank you for telling me that you
are unable to pay what is owed.

05:50.182 --> 05:54.856
I shall give you
a little more time, hmm?

05:54.981 --> 05:58.733
See, I told you Mr. Swede
was a reasonable man.

05:58.899 --> 06:00.061
Heh.

06:00.186 --> 06:01.319
Yeah.

06:01.485 --> 06:02.998
Don't say that.

06:03.123 --> 06:05.634
Yeah.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.371
He just took one of our slides.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.741
Are you sure we can find them?

06:13.866 --> 06:15.142
Yes.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.211
But they're not going
to be happy to see us.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.879
Why is that?

06:19.004 --> 06:24.259
These rituals... they're not
meant for white man's eyes.

06:34.453 --> 06:35.603
Father?

06:36.988 --> 06:38.148
Father?

06:41.859 --> 06:45.037
It's Ruth...

06:45.162 --> 06:46.406
Your daughter.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.411
What are you doing here?

06:52.837 --> 06:55.540
Mother died.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.376
I came to find you.

06:58.542 --> 07:01.720
Well, we'll send you to
the mission in council bluffs.

07:01.845 --> 07:03.673
They'll take care of you.

07:03.839 --> 07:06.718
The mission sent me here.
They said...

07:06.884 --> 07:09.721
Yea, you're not staying here.

07:13.055 --> 07:14.434
I have nowhere else to go.

07:17.593 --> 07:20.160
She can stay in the church tent.

07:21.997 --> 07:23.985
At least till we get back.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.979
I'll decide where
you go when we return.

07:29.104 --> 07:31.534
In the meantime,
there's a bed in the back.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.008
Thank you, father.

07:51.157 --> 07:53.390
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

07:54.227 --> 07:56.559
12, 15 years.

07:56.725 --> 07:59.187
I don't exactly recollect.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.607
And you're just going
to leave her here...

08:02.773 --> 08:04.818
In a place like this?

08:08.007 --> 08:09.807
You're right.

08:21.653 --> 08:26.056
There are some things
I need to tell you.

08:29.427 --> 08:36.475
There's... bacon in the bear box...

08:36.600 --> 08:40.068
And... and... and coffee and flour.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.549
Don't let the, uh,
the drunks stumble in and...

08:44.674 --> 08:47.943
And sleep on the pews.

08:48.485 --> 08:52.647
There's a butcher knife under...
Under that altar if you need it.

08:54.684 --> 08:59.253
And just... you know,
try to make yourself useful.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.899
Don't leave the tent...

09:03.024 --> 09:07.861
You know, unless, uh...
It's on fire.

09:10.098 --> 09:11.865
Understood?

09:20.240 --> 09:29.191
Either the roof or...
Mum's hair was set ablaze...

09:29.316 --> 09:32.363
By the Harrigan brothers?

09:32.529 --> 09:33.895
Those bastards.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.367
Did they say they were
able to put the fire out?

09:36.533 --> 09:37.999
Uh...

09:38.124 --> 09:40.201
What the hell is this strange wind?

09:40.326 --> 09:41.873
The bloody last page is missing.

09:43.540 --> 09:46.798
Oh, Jesus!
It's a whirlwind!

09:47.336 --> 09:48.699
Where did you...

09:51.799 --> 09:54.705
No. No, no, no!

09:55.719 --> 09:58.018
Bloody hell.

09:58.143 --> 09:59.307
What are you...

10:02.981 --> 10:05.688
We thought you said you were
going to give us more time.

10:05.854 --> 10:09.859
You asked for a little more time,

10:10.025 --> 10:14.948
and that's what I gave
you. A little more time.

10:28.571 --> 10:31.640
Put your backs
into it there, boys!

10:34.091 --> 10:36.386
Come on! Work, you mules.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.971
Hey, up!

10:38.137 --> 10:40.557
I want all the walking
bosses right here, right now.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.477
Thomas, Toole...

10:48.957 --> 10:51.101
Y'all are getting paid
to work the men

10:51.226 --> 10:53.236
until the payroll
situation gets figured out.

10:54.929 --> 10:56.739
Again?

10:56.905 --> 10:59.367
If they aren't paid,
they'll strike, Mr. Bohannon.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.578
Then you keep quiet
as long as you can.

11:02.744 --> 11:05.039
Hey, now, walking bosses only.

11:05.205 --> 11:06.916
I am a walking boss.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.710
Tell 'em you made me a walking boss.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.670
Get back to work.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.955
This about all you walking
bosses getting paid again

11:13.080 --> 11:15.258
and we ain't gettin'
paid again, right?

11:15.424 --> 11:21.931
Tell you what... you keep
your mouth shut and you keep your job.

11:22.097 --> 11:23.098
Now, get back to work.

11:23.223 --> 11:24.434
Come on!

11:29.188 --> 11:33.318
Someone needs to put
that boy in his place.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.376
2,000 miles due west
lies the Pacific ocean,

11:36.501 --> 11:38.879
and yet I remain stranded here,

11:39.004 --> 11:42.239
blocked by the great rocky mountains.

11:43.641 --> 11:48.249
The rocky mountains...
They are some 500 miles from here.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.960
Beyond that rise,
the Platte River forks.

11:54.085 --> 11:57.129
Do I follow it to the North or South?

11:57.254 --> 11:59.564
A mistake here and
we could miss our strike

11:59.689 --> 12:03.056
on the Rockies by hundreds of miles.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.851
I'm assuming you strike
the mountains at any route you take.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.242
The problem is not striking
the mountains, Lily.

12:10.367 --> 12:13.769
The problem is crossing
the mountains.

12:16.472 --> 12:20.718
And you think Robert was
the only person who knew the way?

12:20.843 --> 12:24.956
It took him 7 years
and my open purse...

12:25.081 --> 12:28.289
But yes, he told me he'd found it.

12:31.719 --> 12:34.504
Surely there'll be other surveys?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.599
Oh, yes. Ha ha.

12:36.724 --> 12:39.235
Yes, someone will
build this railroad,

12:39.360 --> 12:42.572
but... without the secret,
which Robert took to his grave,

12:42.697 --> 12:45.074
it will not be me.

12:45.199 --> 12:52.071
If I'm remembered, it will
be as the man who failed.

12:55.910 --> 13:02.681
Unfortunately, Robert will
probably not be remembered at all.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.803
At pay up, I'm gonna buy
me a double hot soak.

13:17.262 --> 13:18.881
And liniment.

13:19.047 --> 13:21.843
And a bottle of whiskey
that don't burn going down.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.043
Ha ha.

13:23.168 --> 13:24.804
We ain't gettin' paid.

13:26.104 --> 13:27.981
Well, they ain't paid us last week.

13:28.106 --> 13:30.059
I was figurin' on double pay today.

13:30.225 --> 13:33.187
You might as well put
that tool down and go back to camp.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.523
That's what I'm gonna do.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.158
Hey!

13:39.283 --> 13:41.918
Hey!

13:43.054 --> 13:44.866
It ain't quittin' time.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.132
It is for me.

13:46.257 --> 13:47.299
I done worked for free my whole life,

13:47.424 --> 13:49.203
I ain't doin' that no more.

13:50.537 --> 13:52.081
You get back in that cut.

13:52.247 --> 13:54.542
Get down off that horse
and put me in the cut.

13:58.902 --> 14:01.924
I don't need some slave
uprising on my hands this day.

14:04.106 --> 14:05.720
That's how you see it?

14:09.979 --> 14:13.478
All I see is some field hand
acting like a house boy.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.147
Take off that gun.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.386
Take it off.

14:34.002 --> 14:35.416
Give it to him now, boy!

14:47.514 --> 14:49.931
Mr. Bohannon!

14:54.820 --> 14:59.232
I hired you to run these
men to build my railroad,

14:59.398 --> 15:03.069
not to wrestle in the dirt
with your former chattel.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.506
What is the meaning of this?

15:05.631 --> 15:07.175
Payroll!

15:07.300 --> 15:08.533
Lack of.

15:10.268 --> 15:13.746
And who told the men
there is no payroll?

15:18.043 --> 15:19.836
I did.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.005
Well, you told them nonsense.

15:23.171 --> 15:28.694
Gentlemen, I see
that unfounded rumors

15:28.819 --> 15:30.471
have caused tempers to flare.

15:30.637 --> 15:36.269
Believe me, the payroll is en route,
merely delayed.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.063
And as for you and
your sparring partner,

15:39.229 --> 15:42.773
Mr. Bohannon,
I suggest you settle your differences

15:42.898 --> 15:44.610
like the gentlemen
I know you all to be.

15:47.303 --> 15:50.658
This evening,
when you have completed your work,

15:50.824 --> 15:54.953
I suggest a pugilistic match

15:55.078 --> 16:00.257
between Mr. Bohannon
and his negro Nemesis!

16:00.382 --> 16:01.558
A real fight.

16:01.683 --> 16:03.526
Yeah!
Yeah!

16:03.651 --> 16:06.563
And to compensate
you for the tardiness

16:06.688 --> 16:08.365
of your well-earned pay,

16:08.490 --> 16:14.307
I will donate 10 cases of
whiskey for your refreshment.

16:32.699 --> 16:35.115
{pub}I didn't know you had a daughter.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.108
Well, now you know.

16:39.277 --> 16:42.722
Why don't you ever speak of her?

16:42.847 --> 16:45.824
Are you really going
to send her away?

16:45.949 --> 16:50.509
You know, Jesus says,
"if any man come to me

16:50.675 --> 16:54.466
"and not hate his father
and hate not his mother

16:54.591 --> 16:56.735
"and his wife and his children

16:56.860 --> 17:02.605
and his own life,
then he cannot be my disciple."

17:02.771 --> 17:06.525
I don't think I have enough hate
in my heart to be a good Christian.

17:09.271 --> 17:10.905
Whoa. Whoa.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.823
Black moon.

17:19.948 --> 17:21.457
Father.

17:21.623 --> 17:26.170
Why have you brought this
man to our sacred place?

17:39.300 --> 17:42.444
He's putting a curse on you.

17:42.569 --> 17:44.513
He calls you black spider

17:44.638 --> 17:48.526
because you trapped
my son in your web.

17:48.692 --> 17:52.687
Joseph came to Christ
on his own free will.

17:52.812 --> 17:55.413
Is that so?

17:56.741 --> 18:00.195
Tell me, do you have
no children of your own?

18:00.320 --> 18:04.131
I had... I have a daughter.

18:04.256 --> 18:07.067
Who just returned to him.

18:07.192 --> 18:08.879
Praise God.

18:09.045 --> 18:10.923
Where has she been?

18:12.664 --> 18:13.974
I left her.

18:14.099 --> 18:18.431
You abandoned your
child and steal mine.

18:20.671 --> 18:23.978
What kind of man are you?

18:25.442 --> 18:27.773
A flawed one.

18:28.045 --> 18:31.124
Father, reverend Cole has come...

18:31.249 --> 18:33.988
Because he's concerned
for our people.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.643
Chief, the soldiers
have already come.

18:36.768 --> 18:40.286
Yeah.
4 soldiers on horseback.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.037
But more will come,

18:42.203 --> 18:46.838
enough to wipe out all the
human beings from the world.

18:46.963 --> 18:48.335
But there may be another way.

18:48.501 --> 18:52.542
If you come to town,
we discuss peace.

18:52.667 --> 19:00.241
I will come, but only if
my son black moon asks me to come.

19:06.315 --> 19:08.147
Please come...

19:08.416 --> 19:10.960
For me.

19:13.087 --> 19:17.958
Come inside, gentlemen,
and witness the greatest contest

19:18.448 --> 19:20.603
in the history of hell on wheels!

19:20.728 --> 19:23.773
The finest corn liquor compliments

19:23.898 --> 19:29.878
of Mr. Thomas Durant, president
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.579
Hey, over here.
Give me one of those.

19:31.704 --> 19:35.217
You must be able to spell
your name to wager, you morons.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.520
Now, who just flung down that silver?

19:38.645 --> 19:41.656
This here's enough peppers
to make a Mexican cry.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.282
It'll probably kill you.

19:50.271 --> 19:51.899
Sean's putting everything
we got in you.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.693
I thought you were broke?

19:56.462 --> 19:58.572
We put the magic lantern
up for collateral.

20:00.131 --> 20:02.451
- Sure that was a good idea?
- Sure.

20:02.617 --> 20:04.370
The whole town's betting on you.

20:06.538 --> 20:10.617
There's time enough if you want
to place a bet on yourself.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.618
Nah.

20:12.743 --> 20:16.021
I ain't doin' this for money, Mick.

20:16.146 --> 20:19.549
Then why are you doing it?

20:20.751 --> 20:26.198
Hmm. That man needs
to be put in his place.

20:26.323 --> 20:29.634
There's only one thing
he understands.

20:29.759 --> 20:35.317
What if, God forbid...
You were to lose?

20:43.033 --> 20:46.341
That ain't gonna happen.

21:02.290 --> 21:05.723
You win this fight,
they're gonna kill you,

21:05.889 --> 21:08.605
and if you lose,
they're gonna kill you

21:08.730 --> 21:10.007
for thinkin' you could win.

21:10.132 --> 21:11.441
You don't understand.

21:11.566 --> 21:13.105
This is somethin' I gotta do.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.411
Why?

21:14.536 --> 21:16.146
Because you're half white...

21:16.271 --> 21:18.319
Or because you're half black?

21:22.076 --> 21:27.256
All my life folk
been tellin' me who I am.

21:27.381 --> 21:30.092
One white man tell me I'm a slave,

21:30.217 --> 21:34.896
another one say I'm free.

21:35.021 --> 21:39.624
Tonight I say who I am.

21:59.545 --> 22:01.028
{pub}Hello.

22:01.194 --> 22:05.025
Tonight and one night only,

22:05.150 --> 22:06.693
you will be allowed in.

22:06.818 --> 22:09.596
But one sign of misbehavior...

22:09.721 --> 22:12.164
And I will throw you all in chains.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.634
Understood?

22:14.759 --> 22:15.876
Good.

22:16.042 --> 22:18.037
You are welcome. Come in.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.405
Yeah. That's it.

22:20.864 --> 22:21.974
Your corner here.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.101
Mr. Ferguson's corner.

22:24.226 --> 22:25.777
Bloody hell.

22:25.902 --> 22:29.148
Look at what the bowels of
the place have s out.

22:53.362 --> 22:55.416
Get the bloody hell out.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.341
What do you think you're doing?

23:02.338 --> 23:04.258
Make way for Mr. Bohannon.

23:25.225 --> 23:27.770
You gonna win this fight, ya hear?

23:27.895 --> 23:29.408
You gonna win this fight for us.

23:29.824 --> 23:31.368
You hear me?!

23:40.006 --> 23:42.951
Jesus, he is a big buck,
Mr. Bohannon.

23:43.076 --> 23:46.120
It ain't all about the brawn, Mick.

23:50.817 --> 23:55.362
Now, this fight is going
to be a fair fight.

23:57.256 --> 23:59.567
No grappling below the waist.

23:59.692 --> 24:02.649
No eyeball gouging.

24:03.028 --> 24:04.905
No biting.

24:05.030 --> 24:07.988
No unnecessary kicking.

24:09.834 --> 24:15.829
Now, the fighters will come from
their corners and toe this line.

24:17.442 --> 24:21.721
Mr. Dix is going to be the referee...

24:24.849 --> 24:28.050
For this contest.

24:28.216 --> 24:33.198
Now, I assume both fighters
are ready to fight.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.270
Toes on!

24:54.158 --> 24:56.144
Yeah!

25:04.185 --> 25:04.878
Fight!

25:10.758 --> 25:13.679
Push them back, will ya?

25:32.712 --> 25:34.867
All right, boys,
back to your corners.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.115
Back to your corners.

25:39.370 --> 25:40.461
30 seconds!

25:40.586 --> 25:43.264
Out of the way.
Sit down.

25:51.363 --> 25:55.299
The bank is denying the request
for a credit extension.

26:03.541 --> 26:07.086
Reply.

26:07.211 --> 26:09.922
If credit not extended forthwith,

26:10.047 --> 26:14.293
will call in all shares
of aforesaid bank stock

26:14.418 --> 26:19.030
to be joined by other
4 major investors. Stop.

26:19.155 --> 26:23.916
Anticipate collapse of bank
by close of business tomorrow.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.637
Stop.

26:25.762 --> 26:27.730
And send.

26:34.136 --> 26:38.740
Samson brought
the temple down on his head.

26:40.176 --> 26:43.454
I will happily do the same.

26:47.271 --> 26:48.692
Give him a fat lip, Mr. Bohannon!

26:48.817 --> 26:50.461
He already has two, lad!

26:52.360 --> 26:54.279
Get in there and fight, boy.

26:57.156 --> 26:59.002
Get him!

26:59.127 --> 27:01.495
Knock him down!

27:18.245 --> 27:21.548
Knock his nappy n head off!

27:22.181 --> 27:24.393
Punch his black arse back to Africa!

27:24.559 --> 27:26.985
Get up!
On your feet.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.150
Are you gonna start fighting or what?

27:32.316 --> 27:34.569
Huh?

27:41.567 --> 27:43.328
About to see this now.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.553
All right, break it up.
Break it up.

27:52.678 --> 27:55.622
Give us some room!
Give us some room!

27:55.747 --> 27:57.925
Give us some room.
Back it off!

27:58.050 --> 27:59.616
Get him to the corner, now.

28:02.554 --> 28:04.298
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

28:04.423 --> 28:05.799
What?

28:05.924 --> 28:07.894
He ain't fighting.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.358
What the hell's
wrong with you, boy? Huh?

28:14.999 --> 28:18.211
Is it 'cause you ain't never
hit no white man before?

28:18.336 --> 28:21.074
Is that it?

28:21.240 --> 28:24.050
Look here, son...

28:24.175 --> 28:29.254
That man who sired you,
that won't your father,

28:29.379 --> 28:32.794
that a white man
who raped your mother.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.493
You know?

28:34.618 --> 28:37.563
The same man done
beat you all your life

28:37.688 --> 28:41.467
with his foot on your neck. Huh?

28:41.592 --> 28:46.183
The same man who say he your master...
When you supposed to be free.

28:46.349 --> 28:49.102
Huh?

28:50.900 --> 28:53.857
Look over here.

28:54.023 --> 28:57.152
That's him sitting
on his soft white ass.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.416
Huh?

28:59.541 --> 29:02.275
I want you go over there...

29:03.311 --> 29:07.621
And I want you to kill him.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.459
You hear?

29:09.584 --> 29:13.129
You go kill him.

29:13.254 --> 29:16.755
You ain't gonna do this for us...

29:16.921 --> 29:18.925
Do this for you.

30:13.377 --> 30:15.487
Take a knee, Mr. Bohannon.

30:15.612 --> 30:17.089
Take a knee!

30:17.214 --> 30:21.150
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

30:25.721 --> 30:26.950
Come on!

30:28.724 --> 30:30.521
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

30:30.646 --> 30:32.070
You still in this.

30:32.195 --> 30:35.125
You sill got him, Mr. Bohannon.
You still got it. Don't worry.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.586
Take a breather, boy.
Take a breather.

30:40.062 --> 30:42.940
{pub}Lent to thy neighbor
in time of his need.

30:43.065 --> 30:45.302
He paid thou thy neighbor again...

31:05.349 --> 31:07.280
Excuse me.

31:59.036 --> 32:01.576
You're almost there.

32:12.712 --> 32:13.853
Mrs. Bell?

32:15.761 --> 32:16.978
Where have you been?

32:17.103 --> 32:18.736
I looked all over for you.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.890
I took a walk.

32:22.658 --> 32:24.901
And then I heard all the commotion.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.636
Ah.

32:26.761 --> 32:31.608
It's a little vulgar for a lady's taste,
I'm afraid.

32:36.871 --> 32:42.377
Ah, I'm afraid my Latin was
a little undernourished.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.629
Bread and circuses.

32:47.547 --> 32:54.389
You engineered this fight as a
distraction until you could get payroll.

32:54.555 --> 32:58.832
Just like the Romans
did with unruly crowds,

32:58.957 --> 33:01.068
give them food and spectacle.

33:01.193 --> 33:03.737
Ahh.

33:03.862 --> 33:07.235
I think you overestimate
my abilities, Lily.

33:07.401 --> 33:10.844
I hope not, for all our sakes.

33:10.969 --> 33:12.446
Holy mother of God.

33:12.571 --> 33:15.248
You had us worried there.

33:15.373 --> 33:17.384
I thought for a wee bit

33:17.509 --> 33:20.654
we'd lost our wager, right, Sean?

33:20.779 --> 33:23.585
Sean?

33:24.949 --> 33:26.254
Sean?

33:37.795 --> 33:40.310
Shall I walk you back to the car?

33:48.338 --> 33:50.904
I have Robert's maps.

33:53.242 --> 33:57.846
And yes... he found the route.

33:59.615 --> 34:00.914
To the Rockies?

34:01.080 --> 34:03.875
And beyond.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.795
And you've had them all this time.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.630
I have.

34:11.626 --> 34:15.195
I knew it!
I knew it!

34:17.598 --> 34:24.146
Oh, I could strangle you
and embrace you at the same time.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.914
Where are they?

34:26.039 --> 34:27.982
They're in a safe place.

34:30.844 --> 34:33.012
Ah.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.909
How much?

34:38.074 --> 34:41.620
What Robert is owed.

34:53.831 --> 34:56.643
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

34:56.768 --> 34:58.144
All right.
That's right.

34:58.269 --> 35:01.057
That's right.
You gonna do this. That's right.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.061
Time!

35:07.478 --> 35:09.522
Now, boy.
Now!

35:13.316 --> 35:16.428
You got it.

35:16.553 --> 35:18.430
Come on, Bohannon!
One more time.

35:18.555 --> 35:19.798
Get in there.

35:19.923 --> 35:21.590
Come on!

35:28.097 --> 35:29.440
Come on, Bohannon!

35:29.565 --> 35:30.608
Get your hands up.
Hands up.

35:30.733 --> 35:32.801
Come on, boy!

35:36.705 --> 35:37.927
Come on, Bohannon.

35:51.352 --> 35:53.610
Get in there.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.530
It's over.
It's over.

37:47.436 --> 37:49.596
Why are you so glib?

37:50.429 --> 37:52.103
We just lost everything.

37:54.904 --> 37:57.233
I bet it all on the darkie.

37:59.693 --> 38:02.374
30 to one.

38:04.911 --> 38:07.994
We're rich, brother.

38:09.949 --> 38:12.493
What'd you use?

38:12.618 --> 38:15.696
The liniment, hmm?

38:15.821 --> 38:18.899
Was it a little pepper
powder to the eyes, was it?

38:19.024 --> 38:21.424
Are you trying to get us both killed?

38:23.028 --> 38:27.305
And Mr. Bohannon... being
our only friend and all.

38:29.834 --> 38:33.770
This is my only friend.

38:58.928 --> 39:00.662
Ohh.

39:04.266 --> 39:06.094
Are you all right?

39:06.368 --> 39:08.930
Never better.

39:10.873 --> 39:12.841
Good.

39:16.845 --> 39:19.056
Did you enjoy the fight?

39:19.181 --> 39:20.590
Very much.

39:20.715 --> 39:23.945
Good.

39:26.488 --> 39:28.422
Unh.

39:30.358 --> 39:33.302
Thank you for the water.

39:33.427 --> 39:34.861
Unh!

39:58.585 --> 40:00.662
Ah.

40:18.903 --> 40:21.271
Next.

40:23.107 --> 40:27.187
Gregory Toole, walking
boss for cut crew 3.

40:27.312 --> 40:29.844
And to be completely honest
with you, Mr. Bohannon,

40:30.010 --> 40:33.483
we thought you had more in you.

40:37.487 --> 40:39.932
Mmm.

40:40.057 --> 40:44.527
Life does have its surprises,
don't it, Mr. Toole?

40:47.497 --> 40:49.465
Next.

40:52.533 --> 40:57.215
Elam Ferguson, walking boss...

40:57.340 --> 40:59.582
Freedmen cut crew.

41:04.513 --> 41:06.680
Ahem.

42:00.032 --> 42:02.143
You have done it, my son.

42:02.268 --> 42:04.772
The sacrifice is over.

42:05.070 --> 42:11.551
Father... I was blessed.

42:11.676 --> 42:15.283
I had a vision.

42:17.182 --> 42:21.789
I've seen a great steel beast,

42:22.086 --> 42:25.731
its breath was smoke...

42:25.856 --> 42:28.004
It shook the ground.

42:32.462 --> 42:35.231
I killed it.
