ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

00:26.567 --> 00:28.133
THE BUS WILL BE HERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

00:28.133 --> 00:31.000
NOW, REMEMBER, EVEN
THOUGH THIS SKI TRIP

00:31.000 --> 00:32.233
IS ABOUT HAVING FUN,

00:32.233 --> 00:35.400
WE LIVE IN A LAND OF LAWS
WHICH MUST BE OBEYED

00:35.400 --> 00:37.500
IF THIS SOCIETY
IS TO SURVIVE.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.000
IN OTHER WORDS,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.867
I'LL BE WATCHING YOU TWO.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.100
ALL I HEARD
WAS "FUN."

00:44.100 --> 00:46.200
HEH! IT'S OUR FIRST
ROMANTIC WEEKEND

00:46.200 --> 00:48.300
AWAY WITH THE GIRLS...

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
AND THE SCHOOL'S
PICKING UP THE TAB.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.867
OK. I WAS ABLE
TO OBTAIN

00:52.867 --> 00:55.133
A BLUEPRINT
OF THE SKI LODGE.

00:56.667 --> 00:57.567
OUR ROOM IS HERE.

00:57.567 --> 00:58.700
THE GIRLS' ROOM
IS HERE.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.200
FEENY'S ROOM IS
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.467
HUH. HE'S A SLY ONE.

01:02.467 --> 01:05.133
AT PRECISELY 2 A.M.,
YOU WILL SNEAK
FROM OUR ROOM

01:05.133 --> 01:07.000
TO FEENY'S DOOR TO
CHECK FOR SNORING.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.567
RHYTHMIC OR INTERMITTENT?

01:08.567 --> 01:11.967
RHYTHMIC!
I TOLD YOU RHYTHMIC!
AM I ALONE IN THIS?!

01:11.967 --> 01:13.967
OK, OK, RHYTHMIC SNORING
CONFIRMED.

01:13.967 --> 01:17.600
THEN I PROCEED TO SNEAK
OVER TO THE GIRLS' ROOM,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.367
AND I TELL ANGELA

01:19.367 --> 01:21.500
THAT YOU'RE DREAMING
AND CALLING OUT HER NAME.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.100
SHE THEN
WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY,

01:23.100 --> 01:25.133
PAST THE SNORING FEENY,
TO YOUR ROOM.

01:25.133 --> 01:26.567
WHILE YOU'RE
WITH ANGELA,

01:26.567 --> 01:28.934
I'M GONNA BE BUSY
KEEPING TOPANGA...

01:28.934 --> 01:30.934
OCCUPIED UNTIL
ANGELA RETURNS.

01:30.934 --> 01:33.000
MANY HOURS LATER.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.367
MAYBE WE SHOULD TELL THE GIRLS
ABOUT OUR TOP-SECRET PLANS

01:35.367 --> 01:37.000
SO WE DON'T SPRING IT ON 'EM.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.600
WHA--N-N-N-N-NO,
CORY, CORY, CORY.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.033
THAT'S SO NAIVE.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.300
THE WOMEN<i>WANT</i>
TO COME TO OUR ROOM.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.600
THEY JUST NEED
SOME LAME EXCUSE,

01:44.600 --> 01:47.600
AND WE ARE JUST THE GUYS
TO GIVE IT TO THEM.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.600
I LOVE SKIING.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.100
LOOK AT THOSE TWO.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.100
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
PLANNING, DON'T YOU?

01:54.100 --> 01:56.100
YEAH,
THE MIDNIGHT SWITCH.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.600
YOU GOTTA LOVE
THE EFFORT.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.100
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
WORKING HARD, TOO.

02:00.367 --> 02:01.567
I SEE DIAGRAMS.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.100
[CHUCKLING] YOU KNOW,
THE HUMANE THING TO DO

02:04.100 --> 02:06.500
WOULD BE TO TELL THEM
THEY DON'T HAVE A PRAYER.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.500
OH, SURE.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.567
BUT THE FUN THING
TO DO IS...

02:10.567 --> 02:13.300
Both: WE LOVE YOU.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.700
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.734
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
THE BUS IS HERE.

02:18.734 --> 02:20.600
NOW, REMEMBER, I DON'T
WANT ANOTHER INCIDENT

02:20.600 --> 02:23.300
LIKE LAST YEAR'S FIASCO
IN THE AMISH COUNTRY.

02:25.934 --> 02:27.834
WHY'S EVERYONE
LOOKING AT ME?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.300
SOMEONE'S PLANNING
A ROMANTIC WEEKEND,
HUH?

02:34.300 --> 02:36.500
WELL, IT IS A WEEKEND
WITHOUT OUR PARENTS,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.700
SO YOU CAN'T BLAME ME
FOR THINKING ABOUT IT.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.400
OH, I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT, TOO.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.567
REALLY?

02:41.567 --> 02:44.133
YEAH. BUT IT MIGHT
BE MORE ROMANTIC

02:44.133 --> 02:48.300
IF YOU TALKED TO ME
ABOUT OUR WEEKEND PLANS
INSTEAD OF SHAWN.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.734
OK. THAT COULD BE,
THAT COULD BE.

02:51.734 --> 02:55.000
WE START BY, UH,
TIPPING THE GUY

02:55.000 --> 02:58.100
SO HE STOPS THE SKI LIFT
AT AROUND SUNSET.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.133
UH-HUH...

02:59.133 --> 03:00.600
AND THEN THERE'S
NO ONE AROUND

03:00.600 --> 03:01.967
TO KEEP YOU WARM
EXCEPT ME.

03:01.967 --> 03:05.600
I GET SO COLD.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.600
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

03:08.934 --> 03:11.867
AND WHAT DO<i>YOU </i>DO?

03:11.867 --> 03:13.500
WELL,
I'D PUT YOU IN FRONT
OF THE FIREPLACE,

03:13.500 --> 03:16.400
AND WE'D DO
SOME OF THIS...

03:16.400 --> 03:18.200
AND WE'D DRINK
HOT CHOCOLATE

03:18.200 --> 03:19.900
AND DO SOME OF THIS.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.600

ALL THE SAME THINGS, CORY.

YEAH. LISTEN...

03:24.667 --> 03:26.767
LET'S NEVER GET
OFF THE COUCH, OK?

03:26.767 --> 03:28.800
WELL, THAT DOESN'T LEAVE US
A LOT OF TIME FOR SKIING.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.400
OH, THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME TO SKI.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.033
WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

03:33.033 --> 03:35.367
OH! OW! IT'S BROKEN!

03:35.367 --> 03:37.133
IT'S BROKEN IN 7 PLACES!

03:37.133 --> 03:40.700
GIVE ME 50 CCs OF ST. JOSEPH'S
CHEWABLE ASPIRIN, STAT!

03:42.400 --> 03:44.200
THE SLOPES
ARE TREACHEROUS.

[CORY GASPS]
OHH! WHEW!

03:53.934 --> 03:56.900
WELL, I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING'S BROKEN.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.867
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A MILD SPRAIN.

03:59.867 --> 04:02.100
EMBELLISH IT
FOR MY FRIENDS.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.600
I'LL HAVE THE DOCTOR COME
AND EMBELLISH IT FOR YOU.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.400
MY GUESS IS...

04:06.400 --> 04:09.200

SORRY.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.500
WELL, THERE GOES
OUR SENIOR SKI
WEEKEND, HUH?

04:13.500 --> 04:15.700
NO, COR, WE CAN HAVE A GREAT
WEEKEND HERE TOGETHER.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.867
WE CAN SIT HERE WHILE
EVERYBODY ELSE IS OUT
PLAYING IN THE SNOW

04:18.867 --> 04:20.400
AND SKIING AND HAVING FUN,

04:20.400 --> 04:22.834
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH FUN THEY'RE
HAVING WITHOUT US.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.000
GO SKI.
THANK YOU.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.033
NO, GO AHEAD. GO.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.200

WOULD'VE LEFT ME.

YOUR FOOT OUT OF--
AAAAH!

04:38.000 --> 04:42.734

ICE PATCH ON DEVIL'S RUN.

04:42.734 --> 04:46.567
DEVIL'S RUN IS CLOSED
THIS WEEKEND.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.834
THEN WHAT I DID
WAS INSANE.

04:48.834 --> 04:51.734

HOT CHOCOLATE,
INSANE PERSON?

WELL, I'D GET YOU SOME,
BUT MY FOOT REALLY HURTS.

NO, I'LL GET IT FOR US.
IT'S PART OF MY JOB.

04:56.934 --> 04:58.467
THIS MUST BE
A GREAT PLACE TO WORK.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.400
YEAH, BUT DURING THE DAY
IT GETS A LITTLE QUIET

05:00.400 --> 05:03.000
'CAUSE EVERYONE'S
OUT ON THE HILL
AND I'M STUCK INSIDE.

KEEP PUTTING THE MONEY

RIGHT? THAT'S
WHERE I'M GOING?

09:33.800 --> 09:36.033
RIGHT. THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.667
RIGHT. RIGHT.
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

09:38.667 --> 09:39.800
READING.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.033
THE BIBLE.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.367
WAIT, I'M NOT TIRED.
WHO WANTS TO SEE A MOVIE?

09:45.367 --> 09:47.000
AW, THEN, CORY,
YOU CAN STAY UP,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.300
BUT DON'T
STAY UP TOO LATE

09:48.300 --> 09:49.400
BECAUSE I WANT
MY CORY FALCON

09:49.400 --> 09:51.667
FLYING DOWN THE SLOPES
WITH ME TOMORROW, OK?

09:51.667 --> 09:52.834
GOOD NIGHT.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.300
GOOD NIGHT,
LAUREN.
GOOD NIGHT.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.834
WELL, I BETTER
GET SOME SLEEP, TOO.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.033
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

10:02.033 --> 10:06.467
I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE,
LET THE FIRE DIE DOWN...

10:10.300 --> 10:12.567
AND WATCH THE MOON
RISE OVER THE MOUNTAIN.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.967
SOUNDS NICE.

10:14.967 --> 10:18.033
I-I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE

10:18.033 --> 10:19.800
'CAUSE I'M--I'M
FROM THE CITY.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.200
AND IN THE CITY WE
DON'T SEE THAT MANY STARS
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY CALL...

10:23.200 --> 10:25.300
AMBIENT LIGHT.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.300
RIGHT.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.767
AMBIENT LIGHT.

10:27.767 --> 10:29.300
I WAS RAISED
IN THE CITY, TOO.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.400
PHILADELPHIA?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
MM-MM. NEW YORK.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.100
BUT WE MOVED
WHEN I WAS 13.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
I THOUGHT
I'D HATE LIVING
IN THE MOUNTAINS,

10:35.100 --> 10:37.133
BUT NOW I WOULDN'T
LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE.

10:38.567 --> 10:39.834
WELL, I-I'M
FROM THE CITY.

10:39.834 --> 10:42.500
I COULD ONLY LIVE
IN THE CITY, YOU KNOW.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.300
COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT
THAT AMBIENT LIGHT.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.900
IN FACT, I DON'T WANT TO
SEE ANYTHING IN THE SKY.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.233
LOOK.
OK.

10:51.967 --> 10:54.467
WOW, THERE'S
SO MANY STARS UP THERE.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.934
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

10:58.367 --> 11:02.000
YOU WERE DISTRACTED
BY THE CITY LIGHTS.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
OH, THE FIRE'S
GOING OUT.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.400
SHOULD I THROW
ANOTHER LOG ON IT?

11:27.100 --> 11:30.000
SO THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M JUMPING OUT OF A PLANE.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.100
MY DAD AND BROTHER
ARE SCARED TO DEATH--

11:32.100 --> 11:34.233
WAIT, YOU CAN
JUMP OFF A PLANE,

11:34.233 --> 11:36.400
BUT YOU CAN'T
GET OFF A BUS?

11:36.400 --> 11:37.467
AH...HEH.

11:37.467 --> 11:40.200
WELL, I'M AN IRONIC
KIND OF GUY.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.000
I LIKE THAT.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.967
AND I LIKE THE WAY
YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT I'M SAYING.

11:44.967 --> 11:47.967
WELL, YOU'RE EASY
TO LISTEN TO.

11:47.967 --> 11:49.967
AND I DO THINK
YOU'RE INTERESTING.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.233
YOU'RE THE MOST INTERESTING
CUTE MOUNTAIN GIRL

11:53.233 --> 11:54.500
WHO'S EVER RESCUED ME.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.767
SEE?

11:55.767 --> 11:57.200
YOU DO LISTEN.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.767
THANKS FOR POINTING OUT
ALL THIS NATURAL BEAUTY...

12:01.767 --> 12:03.000
OF EVERYTHING...

12:05.667 --> 12:06.834
AROUND ME.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.233
HOW YA DOIN'?

12:08.233 --> 12:09.667
MR. FEENY.
[NERVOUS LAUGH]

12:09.667 --> 12:11.500
WHAT ARE YOU...
DOING UP THIS LATE?

12:11.500 --> 12:13.467
<i>AU CONTRAIRE,</i>
<i>MR. MATTHEWS.</i>

12:13.467 --> 12:14.800
I AM UP WITH THE SUN,

12:14.800 --> 12:16.934
READY TO MAKE
FIRST TRACKS.

12:19.400 --> 12:23.033
BUT I'M QUITE SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU UP THIS EARLY.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.367
CORY.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.500
LAUREN.

12:28.834 --> 12:29.900
AH, HA...

12:29.900 --> 12:31.800
IT'S MORNING.

12:33.834 --> 12:37.000
SO, LAUREN,
I HAD A NICE TIME
TALKING TO YOU.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.300
SO DID I.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.667
I LIKE YOU,
CORY.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.400
YEAH, I LIKE YOU, TOO.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.567
BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT, CAN WE?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.300
NO.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.934
SO...GUESS I SHOULD
GET READY FOR WORK.

12:54.934 --> 12:56.967
WELL...

12:56.967 --> 12:58.500
I'M READY.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.834
LAUREN...

13:04.900 --> 13:06.834
WE COULD
BE FRIENDS.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.367
HEY, YOUR ANKLE'S BETTER.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.200
SO I GUESS YOU'LL
BE SKIING TODAY.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.367
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I CAME UP HERE FOR.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.000
YEAH. I MEAN...

13:19.000 --> 13:21.200
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO STAY
INSIDE ON YOUR LAST DAY.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.100
HAVE FUN.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.967
DON'T GET HURT.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.700
ALL NIGHT?

13:31.700 --> 13:34.400
NOTHING HAPPENED, SHAWN.
WE WERE JUST TALKING.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.834
ALL NIGHT?!

13:38.100 --> 13:39.367
GOOD MORNING, CORY.

13:39.367 --> 13:41.500
HOW'S YOUR ANKLE
FEELING?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.000
HUH...

13:43.000 --> 13:44.400
IT'S CONFUSED.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.467
WHAT?

13:45.467 --> 13:48.033
I MEAN, IT-IT'S
BOTHERING ME, AND...

13:48.033 --> 13:51.000
IT'S NOT BOTHERING ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I SHOULD DO.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.567
IF IT'S BOTHERING
YOU AT ALL,

13:52.567 --> 13:53.967
THEN YOU SHOULD
STAY OFF OF IT.

13:59.467 --> 14:01.233
YEAH, IT'S BOTHERING ME.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.900
HEY! I SAW YOU
WITH LAUREN.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.900
YOUR ANKLE'S FINE.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.734
YOU LIED TO TOPANGA!

14:18.734 --> 14:19.867
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.367
YOU LIED TO TOPANGA!

14:22.367 --> 14:24.467
SHAWN, ALL WE DID
WAS TALK.

14:24.467 --> 14:25.700
ALL YOU DID
WAS TALK?

14:25.700 --> 14:26.734
THAT'S IT.

14:26.734 --> 14:28.300
NO KISSY?
JUST TALKY.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.100
WELL, ARE YOU
GONNA TELL TOPANGA?

14:30.100 --> 14:32.100
WHY WOULD I TELL TOPANGA
ABOUT SOMETHING

14:32.100 --> 14:33.600
THAT'S NOT GONNA
TURN INTO ANYTHING?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.400
IF IT'S NOT GONNA TURN
INTO ANYTHING,

14:35.400 --> 14:38.233
THEN HOW COME YOU LIED
ABOUT YOUR ANKLE?

14:38.233 --> 14:41.767
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
WITH TOPANGA FOREVER.

14:41.767 --> 14:42.967
OK?

14:42.967 --> 14:44.600
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ANOTHER GIRL.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.200
I CAN'T HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ANOTHER GIRL.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.700
LAUREN
WILL UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.567
SURE, SHE WILL.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.400
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.834
YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM AT ALL.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.000
<i>READ </i>THE BIBLE!

15:09.033 --> 15:10.500
[DING]

15:10.500 --> 15:12.734
YES, SIR, MAY I HELP YOU?

15:12.734 --> 15:14.600
I DON'T WANNA
HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ANOTHER GIRL.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.900
NEITHER DO I.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.467
WHY AREN'T YOU SKIING?

15:19.467 --> 15:23.367
I CAN'T HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ANOTHER GIRL.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.500
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.900
I UNDERSTAND IT.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.100
AND I RESPECT IT.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.567
WHY AREN'T YOU SKIING?

15:29.567 --> 15:32.500
BECAUSE I NEED
TO MAKE SURE
WE UNDERSTAND

15:32.500 --> 15:34.767
THAT LAST NIGHT
DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.600
DOES TOPANGA KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

15:37.600 --> 15:41.967
NO, I TOLD HER MY ANKLE
WAS STILL SORE.

15:41.967 --> 15:44.400
SO YOU LIED
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND

15:44.400 --> 15:47.000
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.100
I LIED TO MY GIRLFRIEND
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO HURT HER.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.300
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT LAST NIGHT MEANT.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.700
CORY, YOU KNOW
IN THAT GAME, THEY ASK,

15:57.700 --> 16:01.500
"IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE
YOUR PERFECT MATE,
WHO WOULD IT BE?"

16:01.500 --> 16:03.867
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS
KNOWN THE ANSWER.

16:03.867 --> 16:05.000
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.300
IT WASN'T YOU.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.500
OH.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.600
I'M TRYING TO SAY...

16:11.600 --> 16:13.700
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.767
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE
TAKE YOU BY SURPRISE.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.767
SURPRISE.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.100
GOOD. WELL, I'M GLAD
WE CLEARED THIS UP.

16:44.033 --> 16:45.300
YOU KISSED HER?

16:45.300 --> 16:46.700
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.300
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO, CORY.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.700
YOU ARE NOT
GONNA TELL TOPANGA,
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

16:50.700 --> 16:52.200
I KNOW WOMEN, COR,

16:52.200 --> 16:54.000
AND I KNOW SHE'LL
FORGIVE YOU FOR
TALKING TO LAUREN,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.500
AND I KNOW SHE'LL
EVEN FORGIVE YOU
FOR LYING TO HER

16:56.500 --> 16:58.200
BECAUSE YOU
NEVER HAVE BEFORE,

16:58.200 --> 17:00.467
BUT SHE WILL NEVER,
EVER FORGIVE YOU

17:00.467 --> 17:01.934
FOR KISSING
ANOTHER GIRL.

17:01.934 --> 17:05.000
DON'T TELL HER, COR.
DON'T.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I WANT THIS WHOLE THING
NEVER TO HAVE HAPPENED.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.033
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.233
HI, TOPANGA.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.834
HI, CORY. YOU'RE BACK
ON YOUR FEET.

17:14.834 --> 17:18.000
DO YOU WANNA SKI A FEW RUNS
WITH ME BEFORE THEY
CLOSE THE SKI LIFTS?

17:19.600 --> 17:20.900
WE NEED TO TALK.

17:21.967 --> 17:22.967
OK.

17:27.834 --> 17:33.900
HONESTY'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.734
AND YOU MEAN
EVERYTHING TO ME,

17:36.734 --> 17:37.934
SO...

17:37.934 --> 17:39.767
I WANT TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

17:41.367 --> 17:44.133
I LIED ABOUT MY ANKLE TODAY
SO I COULD STAY AT THE LODGE.

17:44.133 --> 17:46.934
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO STAY AT THE LODGE?

17:46.934 --> 17:50.300
WELL, I MET AN INTERESTING
PERSON THAT I LIKED TALKING TO.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.200
LAUREN.

17:53.200 --> 17:57.300
YOU LIED TO ME
SO YOU CAN SPEND TIME
WITH ANOTHER GIRL?

17:57.300 --> 17:59.667
SEE, AFTER YOU WENT
TO BED LAST NIGHT,

17:59.667 --> 18:03.033
WE SPENT...
THE WHOLE NIGHT TALKING.

18:03.033 --> 18:07.100
AND THIS MORNING I TOLD HER
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.600
YOU LIED TO ME?

18:09.600 --> 18:10.967
I'M SORRY.

18:10.967 --> 18:15.400
I'D RATHER BREAK MY ANKLE
INTO 50,000 PIECES

18:15.400 --> 18:16.667
THAN CAUSE YOU PAIN.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.400
I'M NEVER GONNA
LIE TO YOU AGAIN.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.667
CORY, IT'S OK FOR YOU

18:22.667 --> 18:25.767
TO TALK TO
AN INTERESTING PERSON,

18:25.767 --> 18:28.033
BUT IT'S NOT OK
THAT YOU LIED TO ME.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.000
I KNOW.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.667
I SHOULDN'T LIE TO SOMEONE
I LOVE MORE THAN ANYTHING.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.467
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.200
DID ANYTHING ELSE
HAPPEN BETWEEN YOU?

18:45.834 --> 18:49.867
WAIT, I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.600
DID ANYTHING ELSE
HAPPEN BETWEEN YOU?

18:57.834 --> 19:00.100
NO. NOTHING.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.867
BE SURE AND TELL
YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT
THE MOUNT SUN LODGE!

19:20.867 --> 19:23.000
THEY MADE ME SAY THAT.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.700
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU, LAUREN.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.600
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE

19:28.600 --> 19:30.700
BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.567
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

19:32.567 --> 19:34.567
I WASN'T GOING TO.

19:34.567 --> 19:37.300
YOU RAN OFF
BEFORE WE COULD TALK.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.967
I SAID I LIKE YOU,
CORY, AND I MEANT IT.

19:38.967 --> 19:40.967
I DON'T WANT
TO IGNORE THAT.

19:40.967 --> 19:44.100
WELL, IT'S
ALL IN THIS LETTER.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.934
I HOPE
YOU'LL READ IT.

19:46.934 --> 19:48.834
ARE YOU READY?

19:49.934 --> 19:51.600
I GOTTA GO.

20:10.567 --> 20:11.300
HI.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.567
HI.

20:13.567 --> 20:16.934
CAN I SIT NEXT
TO YOU ON THE BUS?

20:16.934 --> 20:20.100
YOU BETTER.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.200
LET'S TALK
ALL THE WAY HOME, OK?

20:22.200 --> 20:23.767
I'D LOVE THAT.

20:23.767 --> 20:24.767
GOOD.

20:24.767 --> 20:28.867
I'LL JUST
PUT THIS STUFF
ON THE BUS.
