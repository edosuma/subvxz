WEBVTT

00:50.920 --> 00:52.036
<i>They won't...</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:54.794
<i>She won't stop, you know?</i>

00:54.880 --> 00:55.916
<i>Day after...</i>

00:57.240 --> 00:59.118
<i>I was a maker.</i>

00:59.200 --> 01:02.432
<i>I'm gonna do it tonight...
when she's sleeping.</i>

01:04.120 --> 01:05.679
<i>But I'm scared--</i>

02:38.920 --> 02:41.833
She said that
I gotta make a meatloaf.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.479
I said we'd bring
Jell-O salad,

02:43.600 --> 02:47.230
but Kitty said
meatloaf, so...

02:47.320 --> 02:48.834
Hon?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.515
So... What's that, hon?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.796
I said it's Gordo's
birthday tonight.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.352
We're supposed to be at your brother's
at 4:00 with meatloaf.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.320
It sounds different today,
don't you think?

03:02.400 --> 03:03.629
Like, angry?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.554
I'm washing towels.
It's a towel sound.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.190
Oh.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.599
Kitty said they just got one of 
those fancy European all-in-ones.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.514
Says it washes and dries.
One machine.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.353
Can you believe that?

03:18.440 --> 03:20.033
Bet that set
them back a penny.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.554
He can afford it,
your brother.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.114
Kitty said he just
got a big promotion

03:23.200 --> 03:26.159
after only working
there a year.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.560
Kitty said they also got
one of those fancy new

03:27.640 --> 03:30.553
surround sound systems.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.559
Guess I married
the wrong Nygaard.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.029
Oh.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.750
That's what I said.
We had a good laugh.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.957
Well, it's just
slow now at the shop.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.155
Hon... that's what
you always say. "Slow."

03:51.640 --> 03:54.360
Well...

03:54.440 --> 03:56.318
better get back to it.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.395
You make your own wins.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.756
That's what Kitty
said Chaz told her.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.400
Salesmen make
their own wins.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.076
You gotta try harder, hon.
Smile, for Pete's sake.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.514
Maybe wear a nicer tie.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.512
You gave me this tie.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.875
Well, if you were
a better salesman,

04:18.959 --> 04:20.872
I'd have bought
you a nicer tie.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.993
At least take a look.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.232
I keep thinking
maybe it's the settings.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.116
Kitty says Chaz

04:30.200 --> 04:32.999
fixes things around
the house all the time.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.278
Says he took the toaster
apart over the weekend.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.240
Now it's good as new.
Browns to beat the band.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.070
So that's...

05:31.920 --> 05:35.311
Like I said, there's two kinds of policies
you should be thinking about.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.914
You got your Whole Life

05:37.000 --> 05:39.310
and your Whole Life Plus which covers

05:39.440 --> 05:41.193
the same benefits of Whole Life

05:41.280 --> 05:44.318
plus a heck of a lot more.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.835
Well, we just came in to get Charlene
on my health care.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.593
On account I'm having a baby.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.670
Yeah.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.830
A boy, we're hoping.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.149
Or a little girl.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.357
I'd just about hug the pants
off a little girl.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.633
Yeah? Well, uh...

05:58.720 --> 06:00.871
Even more... Yeah.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.350
All the more reason to...

06:03.440 --> 06:06.274
Because what happens...
what happens

06:06.360 --> 06:08.875
if you have an accident
at your job?

06:08.960 --> 06:10.189
I work at the library.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.236
Okay.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.360
What happens if you have a car crash
and go out the windshield...

06:15.440 --> 06:19.320
or... or... or say you're 
up a ladder cleaning out the gutters

06:19.440 --> 06:22.035
and you fall off the darn thing
and break your neck?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.874
These things happen
every day.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.510
And people fall
asleep smoking in bed.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.239
They burn to death.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.356
What... what I'm saying is

06:31.440 --> 06:34.956
the morgue is full of guys thought 
they didn't need life insurance.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.351
For peace of mind, I'm saying, 
to know that your little boy...

06:39.440 --> 06:40.396
Or girl.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.837
Right....or little
girl is taken care of.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.754
We're supposed to be
at my mom's by 4:00.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.957
Yeah, so we're gonna...

06:50.040 --> 06:51.838
Oh, okay.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.880
Well, at least let me give you a 
brochure or I got these pens.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.680
I got these nifty pens...
Look at that, huh?

06:58.760 --> 07:01.070
...with most of the colors.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.631
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
then give me a...

07:07.640 --> 07:08.630
Oh, heck.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.436
Will you look at that?

07:23.520 --> 07:24.670
What is it, Dad?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.638
Yeah, Dad. What is it?

07:26.720 --> 07:28.279
Hey, Sam.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.716
That there, boys, is a black man.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.519
He don't...
he don't look black, Dad.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.599
Yeah, Dad, he don't look black. 
More like a big pumpkin.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.990
Yeah! Yeah, like a big,
stupid pumpkin.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.276
Lester Niggered.

07:42.360 --> 07:48.311
Now, come on, Sam, it's Nygaard...
just like in high school.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.278
You went to high school
with a black man, Dad?

07:50.360 --> 07:51.350
Yeah, Dad, did you?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.750
Shut up.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.479
How you been, Lester?

07:55.560 --> 07:56.676
Yeah, real good.

07:56.760 --> 07:57.750
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.629
Me, too. Yeah, trucking
company's doing super.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.280
Got rigs all over
the Great Lakes.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.955
Just bought a summer
house up Bear Island.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.633
It's pretty sweet.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.800
Hey... you remember
the story I told you

08:17.880 --> 08:21.669
of the boy I put in the oil drum
and rolled onto the highway?

08:21.760 --> 08:22.830
Is that him, Dad?

08:22.920 --> 08:23.910
Yeah, Dad, is that him?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.670
Oh, you betcha.

08:26.760 --> 08:27.750
Betcha.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.876
Good old Lester
pencil dick.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.633
Hey, say, Lester...

08:36.720 --> 08:39.679
what was the name of that girl 
you went with in high school?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.910
You know, the curvy one.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.360
That's Pearl. Yeah.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.760
Yeah, Pearl.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.477
What a rack on that girl, huh?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.152
Dad's saying she had big titties.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.074
Yeah, I know what "rack"
means, you fairy-- Ow!

08:55.160 --> 08:56.833
Yeah, Dad, ow...

08:58.800 --> 09:00.757
You know, she gave me a tug once.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.800
Homecoming senior year.
Had the nice fat hands.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.076
Real soft.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.392
We're married now.
Going on 18 years.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.358
Oh, Dad,
that's embarrassing.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.751
Yeah, Dad,
super embarrassing.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.830
Eighteen years, huh?

09:16.920 --> 09:18.274
Yeah.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.192
That's something.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.840
Never knew what she
saw in you, really.

09:22.920 --> 09:23.876
Well, I...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.720
No, I mean, help me out.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.840
Is it your stupid pencil dick or your
little rat face?

09:32.040 --> 09:35.272
Yeah, well, uh...

09:35.360 --> 09:37.317
I should get back to it.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.840
Come on.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.915
Did I ever tell you
how I used to beat

09:45.000 --> 09:48.152
this little guy up
in high school?

09:48.240 --> 09:51.916
I'd write my name on my fist in 
Sharpie before I'd punch him

09:52.000 --> 09:54.469
so everyone else
would know who did it.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.596
That's a good one, Dad.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.592
Yeah, Dad, real good one.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.909
Remember?

10:05.360 --> 10:08.671
Yeah, I... It's...
it's a long time ago, but...

10:19.320 --> 10:21.198
What a day.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.910
Mmm.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.031
Excuse me, miss?

10:38.120 --> 10:39.440
Do you think...

10:39.520 --> 10:42.672
Will it be much longer?
This thing hurts like the dickens.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.876
We'll call your name.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.792
Yeah, but I've been
here an hour already.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.712
We'll call your name.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.919
Could I have a sip?

11:09.760 --> 11:10.750
Oh.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.277
Heck, take the whole can.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.357
I can't drink the darn
thing without a straw.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.879
Obliged.
Mmm.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.350
What happened
to your nose?

11:45.440 --> 11:48.274
It was...

11:48.360 --> 11:51.751
it was just
a misunderstanding.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.749
Now was this you misunderstanding
the other fella

11:56.840 --> 11:58.957
or him misunderstanding you?

12:00.760 --> 12:03.036
Pardon?

12:03.120 --> 12:05.157
Who misunderstood whom?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.550
No, what I'm saying...

12:07.640 --> 12:10.075
It's...

12:10.160 --> 12:13.676
it's not good to dwell
on these things.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.240
Why?

12:15.320 --> 12:16.515
Pardon?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.717
Why is it not good to
dwell on these things,

12:18.840 --> 12:21.799
especially things that
put you in a hospital?

12:28.640 --> 12:32.793
Well, I was... I was outnumbered,
if you want to know the truth.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.076
Three to one.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.756
Big... big guys, too.
Well, one of them.

12:38.840 --> 12:42.516
Other two were just
kids but big for their age, you know?

12:43.840 --> 12:48.471
If I was any kind of man,
I'd have shown that Sam what's what.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.356
Sam?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.156
Hess.

13:02.840 --> 13:07.119
The bully in high school
and he's a bully now.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.078
So why didn't you...

13:12.200 --> 13:13.600
show him what's what?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.876
Well, his...

13:15.960 --> 13:19.271
He had his sons with him and...

13:19.400 --> 13:21.835
You let a man beat you
in front of his children

13:21.920 --> 13:22.910
to send them a message?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.639
No, that's not...

13:26.520 --> 13:28.671
Heck.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.639
Just... heck.

13:33.160 --> 13:37.074
In my experience, if you let a man
break your nose,

13:37.160 --> 13:40.232
the next time, he tries to break
your spine.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.192
Sam? No way.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.078
I mean, I don't think.

13:45.160 --> 13:50.633
It just... I guess I embarrassed him
in front of his boys.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.439
You embarrassed him?
Yeah, by...

13:52.560 --> 13:58.352
He was telling me about a time where he 
and my wife, they were...

13:58.480 --> 13:59.914
But he didn't know she was my wife

14:00.000 --> 14:02.515
is the thing and when I told him...

14:02.600 --> 14:04.557
This man slept with your wife and

14:04.640 --> 14:06.711
you're worried about embarrassing him?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.474
Not slept. No, they didn't...

14:09.560 --> 14:12.678
He said it was just...

14:12.760 --> 14:15.400
She has soft hands,
see, and I guess...

14:15.480 --> 14:17.358
No, mister, we're not friends.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.796
I mean maybe we will be someday.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.709
But I gotta say, if that were me
in your position...

14:26.920 --> 14:28.274
I would have killed that man.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.712
Well, now...

14:36.800 --> 14:39.520
Come on.

14:43.920 --> 14:48.517
You said he bullied you
in high school, right?

14:48.600 --> 14:49.829
Four years.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.920
Gave me an ulcer.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.110
You know what, one time,

14:57.200 --> 15:00.557
he put me in an oil barrel
and rolled me in the road.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.393
Seriously?

15:07.120 --> 15:11.194
And now he tells you that he had 
relations with your wife.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.479
He bullies you again
in front of his children.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.071
This is a man who doesn't
deserve to draw breath.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.072
Yeah, okay, but...

15:24.160 --> 15:25.150
Here's the thing...

15:25.240 --> 15:27.436
No, that is the thing.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.954
Well, heck!

15:31.320 --> 15:33.915
I mean, okay... okay,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.277
but... what am I
supposed to do?

15:38.360 --> 15:41.319
Heck, you're so sure about it.
Maybe you should just kill him for me.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.711
You're asking me to kill this man.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.634
No, that was... I was joking.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.951
Mr. Nygaard?

15:56.040 --> 15:59.158
Yeah, that's me. Just one second.

15:59.240 --> 16:03.154
We... we... we... we...
We're just two fellas talking, right?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.800
We're just blowing off steam?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.678
Sir, it's real busy.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.876
Like I said, one second.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.792
Sam Hess.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.951
No, just... just one second.
That is not--

16:15.040 --> 16:16.190
Sir!

16:16.880 --> 16:18.439
Just one word.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.716
Yes or no.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.473
Sir, I'm going to give your spot--

16:22.560 --> 16:23.710
Yeah!

16:23.840 --> 16:26.560
Yeah, I'm coming, for Pete's sake.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.356
Cold enough for you, Chief?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.715
Supposed to get down to negative 10 later.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.915
Yeah, heard that.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.395
Don't much like the sound of negative.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.912
Thought I'd strip down to my shorts,
work on my tan.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.753
So what's this here then?

17:30.840 --> 17:33.400
Chief, I arrived on the
scene at 1300 hours,

17:33.480 --> 17:35.392
found this '93 New Yorker.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.870
Looks like she fled the road
and crashed the fence.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.714
I found a set of footprints
leading away from the car.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.871
Thought, possibly,
our driver, injured,

17:42.960 --> 17:45.520
you know, got confused,
wandered into the woods.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.353
I was just about to investigate.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.909
There's blood here.
Hair, too.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.957
Yeah, saw that.

17:52.040 --> 17:56.034
I was thinking maybe a deer, 
but couldn't find the evidence, so...

18:09.560 --> 18:10.914
Here it is.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.919
Son of a gun.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.276
Blood on the steering wheel.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.680
Driver could have hit his head.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.114
Or her head.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.510
You check the trunk?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.080
No, sir.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.910
Huh.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.992
So you want to take a look
at those footprints then?

18:40.080 --> 18:42.197
Sounds good.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.636
How's Ida?

18:50.720 --> 18:53.155
Any day now.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.835
You got a name picked out?

18:55.920 --> 19:00.711
Can't get that woman to decide what 
color to paint the nursery.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.757
Can't believe I missed that
deer in the trunk.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.797
Don't take it hard.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.030
Been doing this a long time.

19:06.120 --> 19:10.512
Never checked for a deer in the trunk
or any wildlife.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.478
Chief.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.636
Hiya, hon.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.756
In the kitchen.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.513
Something smells good.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.717
Your boy wanted a hamburger.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.952
Sounds like my boy.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.557
Molly found a wreck out on 71.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.960
How's she doing?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.032
Molly? Yeah, good.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.554
I always liked her.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.756
Yeah, she's a peach.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.869
Anyhoo, looks like the driver tried 
to head out on foot.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.758
He got lost and froze
to death in the woods.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.877
Oh, my.
Yeah.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.192
Funny thing is, the fellow was just
wearing underpants.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.350
That so?

20:28.440 --> 20:29.476
Yeah.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.394
No ID, nothing.
Hmm.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.472
Couldn't find his clothes anywhere.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.000
Maybe he ate 'em.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.990
Hmm.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.511
I was thinking maybe 
blue for the nursery.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.239
Yeah?
Hmm.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.154
Earlier, I was thinking maybe blue.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.356
Then I changed my mind.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.715
Blue's nice.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.638
Maybe green.

21:04.240 --> 21:08.280
Well... I'm ready to get painting.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.591
Soon as you decide.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.036
You're a good man, Vern Thurman.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.192
My sister was crazy telling me 
not to marry you.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.076
Your sister is crazy.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.510
Hmm.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.280
Dad said we could take turns.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.629
Yeah?

21:40.720 --> 21:43.713
Dad said that he also thinks 
you've got a potato brain.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.076
So-- Hey!

21:54.880 --> 21:57.236
You're doing it wrong.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.313
You need to press your forearm into
the back of his neck,

22:00.400 --> 22:02.915
grab your elbow with the other hand
to choke him right out.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.991
What do you want, mister?

22:06.080 --> 22:07.799
Yeah, mister, what do you want?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.919
Sign outside says Hess & Sons.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.957
Which one's the older boy?
Me.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.839
Mickey.

22:19.920 --> 22:23.516
So... that leaves me in
charge when Dad is gone.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.875
Are not! Mom said...

22:24.960 --> 22:27.077
Mom has nothing
to do with it, sister!

22:27.160 --> 22:28.276
Hey!

22:30.320 --> 22:32.960
Help you with something?

22:33.760 --> 22:35.114
Sam Hess?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.795
Who wants to know?

22:44.960 --> 22:45.950
Me.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.750
Only two reasons to
come to my shop, friend.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.719
Either you need a truck
or you drive a truck, huh?

22:52.800 --> 22:55.076
You a truck driver?

22:55.160 --> 22:58.358
I was just talking
to your boys.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.472
I think the younger
one's a little dim.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.839
What did you say?

23:05.920 --> 23:08.754
His IQ seems low, I'm saying.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.194
Have you had him tested?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.719
Hit him, Dad.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.154
Yeah, Dad, hit him.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.031
I'm gonna restrain myself.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.794
You know, on account of you got 
an obvious head injury

23:27.880 --> 23:30.156
and not beat you to death
with a tire iron.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.597
But I'm gonna ask you again.
What the heck do you want?

23:34.680 --> 23:38.151
I just wanted to
have a look at you.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.554
Okay, that'll do it.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.597
How does a grown man
fall over his own feet?

23:58.680 --> 24:01.275
It was ice.
I slipped on ice.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.430
We should have canceled.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.557
Oh, don't be a baby.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.350
Hi!
Hey, we're here.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.676
We're here.
Hi.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.071
Come on in.
Chaz is working the ham.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.714
Took the whole team
down to Duluth Tuesday.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.200
Big spread at the Marriot.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.760
I've always
wanted to stay there.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.115
Yeah, it's real sweet.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.160
King-sized bed, view of the lake,
you name it.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.232
Boss took me out for dinner.
Just the two of them.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.959
Steak big as a catcher's mitt.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.431
Said, "Chaz, you're going
places in this world."

24:49.520 --> 24:51.557
Gave him a raise
and a corner office.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.597
Yeah.
Hear that, Lester?

24:53.720 --> 24:54.995
A corner office.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.673
Yeah, real good.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.433
And him, your younger brother.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.000
Yeah, I said I heard.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.595
Vice-president,
sales, Midwest region.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.353
Bought the surround
sound to celebrate.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.119
I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?

25:07.240 --> 25:08.993
You're gonna have
to marry that ham,

25:09.080 --> 25:11.356
you get any more familiar with it.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.794
Saw it on <i>Rachael Ray.</i>

25:12.880 --> 25:16.476
She said that massaging
breaks the muscle down,

25:16.560 --> 25:17.630
makes the meat juicier.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.754
Lester never wants
to try new things.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.150
Now, hold on.
That's not true.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.311
We make Gordo try
stuff all the time.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.039
Chaz says we have
to open his horizons.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.589
Broaden his horizons.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.350
It's a big world,
you know.

25:32.440 --> 25:36.593
There is more to life
than just Minnesota.

25:39.800 --> 25:40.916
Took a real tumble, huh?

25:41.720 --> 25:44.474
There's a spot over
by the fire station.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.553
It's always icy.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.240
Don't know what
the heck I was thinking.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.440
Lester...

25:54.560 --> 25:55.550
come out to the garage.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.632
Help me get some more beer.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.157
Took Gordo to a specialist last month.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.356
Think he might
have the autism.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.476
Yeah?

26:07.560 --> 26:08.960
Won't stop drawing on the walls,

26:09.040 --> 26:12.795
and Kitty, she said she found a 
Mason jar in his closet.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.395
I guess that he
pees in it at night.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.479
What's that about?

26:23.240 --> 26:26.756
Hey... you want to see
something cool?

26:26.840 --> 26:29.150
All right.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.511
Sweet!
Yeah, not those.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.274
Gee. What... what is that?

26:42.360 --> 26:47.116
That there... is your M249 SAW
light machine gun,

26:47.200 --> 26:49.840
sometimes referred to as "The Piglet."

26:50.840 --> 26:52.638
Are you allowed...
Can you even have that?

26:52.720 --> 26:53.756
Is it legal?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.394
Technically, no way,

26:55.480 --> 26:58.632
but I got a buddy who works supply
over at Camp Ripley.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.830
And, heck, I'm an American.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.434
I pay my taxes.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.590
You want to take a look?

27:04.680 --> 27:10.119
It's gas-operated, air-cooled, 
shoots 725 rounds per minute.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.317
Okay.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.710
Jeez.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.113
You should have told
me it was so heavy.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.910
Is it okay?
No, Lester, it's not okay! You...

27:23.920 --> 27:25.115
Here.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.511
You broke the darn...

27:28.600 --> 27:30.319
Why are you such a GD screw-up?

27:30.400 --> 27:31.470
Hey, now.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.392
Ever since you were...

27:33.480 --> 27:34.470
And now Kitty.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.758
She said she talked to Pearl last week
and she's had it...

27:37.840 --> 27:39.035
your wife.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.591
Said you'd been acting plain weird,
just moping around.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.677
Said she caught you
standing in the bathroom

27:44.760 --> 27:47.434
with your toothbrush
in your hand just looking in the mirror.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.758
Said foam was coming
out of your mouth like a rabid dog.

27:50.840 --> 27:55.676
Come on. That's... not how
I may or may not be feeling.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.353
And for your information,

27:57.440 --> 27:59.875
I hadn't had a lot of sleep
the night before.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.679
So... so... so, the toothpaste,
that was just nothing...

28:01.760 --> 28:03.672
Did you really trip
on the ice and break your nose?

28:03.760 --> 28:06.116
Yeah. Yes.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.351
I... I told you,
outside the fire station.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.352
You know they run the hoses
and wash the trucks,

28:10.440 --> 28:13.274
and it gets all
slippery and wet.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.795
You know, guys at work,

28:15.920 --> 28:17.877
they talk about how they look 
up to their brothers...

28:18.600 --> 28:20.114
their older brothers.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.433
Sometimes I tell
people you're dead.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.157
I mean, heck, Lester,
you're 40 years old.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.799
When are you gonna
get your act together?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.270
Your own brother?

28:35.320 --> 28:37.391
You didn't have to hit him.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.951
I mean, seriously, what is the 
matter with you?

28:42.920 --> 28:44.639
Your own brother!

29:02.280 --> 29:05.159
Yeah, it's one more...
Yes, one more time.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.720
Before the 17th?

29:07.800 --> 29:09.280
Do you need this
to look like an accident?

29:10.840 --> 29:13.071
Figure it out
and call me back.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.796
Realty.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.996
<i>It's me.</i>

29:21.080 --> 29:24.152
St. Paul, your call was
expected yesterday.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.158
I got delayed.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.197
<i>Problems?</i>

29:28.280 --> 29:30.158
Car trouble. It's fixed now.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.436
But you finished the assignment?

29:32.520 --> 29:34.239
<i>Of course.</i>

29:34.320 --> 29:36.437
And when can they
expect you in Duluth?

29:36.520 --> 29:38.432
<i>The new client
is anxious to begin.</i>

29:38.520 --> 29:41.274
Soon. I took a detour.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.477
And the nature of this detour?

29:45.280 --> 29:48.079
It's personal. 
Shouldn't be more than a day or two.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.000
<i>I'll let Duluth know.</i>

29:51.080 --> 29:52.799
All right.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.639
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
big fella.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.878
Oh, yeah.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.839
Yeah... that's good.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.278
Yeah? Yup?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.230
Mmm.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.470
Yeah?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.474
Jeez. Where?

31:04.680 --> 31:06.478
Okay.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.199
Pick me up, huh?

31:12.560 --> 31:15.359
Gotta go?
Mmm.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.000
Homicide.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.833
Molly's coming to get me.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.515
Go back to sleep, hon.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.592
Love you.
Love you, too.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.516
Thanks.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.716
Ida sleeping?

31:41.800 --> 31:42.916
Yep.

31:47.320 --> 31:51.075
What do you want me
to write for cause of death?

31:51.160 --> 31:53.629
Put "self-explanatory."

31:56.640 --> 31:58.677
You okay there, Bill?

31:58.760 --> 32:00.035
Oh, yeah.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.952
Threw up a bit ago.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.157
Not in here, I hope.
Oh, no...

32:04.240 --> 32:06.755
went out to the parking lot.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.672
Wife made spaghetti for dinner.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.480
Seemed a shame to barf it up.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.152
I'm okay now...
so long as I don't look.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.519
Heck.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.711
That's Sam Hess.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.752
Hess that owns
the trucking company?

32:29.840 --> 32:33.072
Yeah, with the two boys.
Both dumb as a dog's foot.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.800
Hold on.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.600
Isn't Hess tied to
that syndicate of fellas out of Fargo...

32:38.680 --> 32:40.080
gunrunners and such?

32:40.160 --> 32:42.038
So they say.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.191
Never seen the proof.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.599
Well, jeez, you...

32:46.680 --> 32:47.670
I mean, you think this could be,

32:47.760 --> 32:49.877
like, an organized crime thing?

32:49.960 --> 32:51.394
You know, a hit or the like?

32:52.520 --> 32:53.795
I don't know what I think yet...

32:53.880 --> 32:56.315
except I was warm in
bed half an hour ago.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.350
How many times
I got to tell you?

33:08.440 --> 33:10.875
You can't just
take the sheets off of one bed

33:10.960 --> 33:12.110
and stick 'em on another.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.236
It's unsanitary.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.994
I shake 'em out first.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.470
You don't have the sense
God gave a clam, do you?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.319
Go shovel the walk.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.077
I need a room.
Just you?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.360
Pardon?
Is it just for you, the room?

33:33.440 --> 33:34.669
What difference does that make?

33:34.760 --> 33:36.399
It's a different
rate for two.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.871
And if you got pets,
dog, cat, it's an extra 10 bucks.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.360
What if I got a fish?

33:42.440 --> 33:44.511
Excuse me?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.637
Would a fish cost me $10?

33:47.440 --> 33:51.639
Or what if I kept
spiders or mice?

33:51.720 --> 33:53.200
What if I had bacteria?

33:53.280 --> 33:55.351
Sir, bacteria are not pets.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.715
Could be.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.759
Sir, perhaps you'd
be happier in a different motel?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.360
I just want to know the policy.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.638
You see, I'm a student
of institutions.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.436
Sir, do you have
a pet or not?

34:12.239 --> 34:15.233
No, it's just me.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.391
Why do you let her
talk to you like that?

34:36.480 --> 34:38.391
She's not that bad.

34:38.480 --> 34:41.154
Son, she compared
you to a clam.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.833
Well, what should I do?

34:44.920 --> 34:47.879
A guy insulted me once.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.078
I pissed in his gas tank.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.516
Car never drove straight again.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.874
<i>Leroy's Motor Inn.</i>

35:18.640 --> 35:19.596
Yes, ma'am.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.157
I'm looking out my window,
and there's a young fellow

35:23.240 --> 35:26.950
urinating in the gas
tank of a red Cavalier.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.713
<i>Son of a--</i>

35:30.040 --> 35:33.431
Hey!

35:33.520 --> 35:35.318
You little...

35:47.040 --> 35:48.190
Warm you up, hon?

35:48.280 --> 35:49.634
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.710
Looking at?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.314
Murder file.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.835
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.640
Sam Hess got himself killed 
last night over at the Lucky Penny.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.154
You don't say.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.959
Knife in the head.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.073
You didn't hear that from me.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.837
Hey there, Molly. Lou.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.149
Coffee?
Sure.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.356
Eggs over medium?

36:11.480 --> 36:12.516
Won't say no.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.319
How's the leg?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.638
Goes from my ass to
the ground just like the other.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.313
Thinking of doing some
ice fishing this weekend.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.629
Sorry to hear it.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.439
Interested?
No, sir.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.910
The only thing I ever
caught fishing in winter was a cold.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.360
Say, Chief, listen,
I been thinking

36:28.440 --> 36:30.432
about that fella
in the snow with the underpants.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.193
Mmm-hmm.
Something odd about that.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.114
You're saying other than the fact 
he was just wearing panties?

36:35.200 --> 36:37.999
Yeah. See, we know from the wreck 
that whoever was driving

36:38.080 --> 36:39.594
cracked their head on the 
steering wheel, right?

36:39.680 --> 36:41.512
But the fella in the snow...
No head injury.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.590
Yeah, so you see--

36:42.720 --> 36:44.871
That's some good police work there,
Deputy.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.679
Oh. Thanks.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.150
But if he's not the driver,
I guess we gotta ask...

36:50.440 --> 36:52.079
who is he?

36:52.160 --> 36:53.719
Ran his prints, nothing.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.678
Plus, it turns out
the car was stolen.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.910
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.116
Yeah,
over in Grand Forks.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.716
I called the local PD.
I'm just waiting on a callback.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.071
Any thoughts
there on Hess?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.396
No, not as such.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.552
The, um...
lady that Hess was with

37:11.640 --> 37:13.154
didn't get a good look
at the fella who killed him

37:13.240 --> 37:14.913
on account of all the blood in
her eyes, but...

37:15.000 --> 37:16.912
you know, we're checking
the knife for prints.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.117
Also, Bill's going
around to local stores

37:19.200 --> 37:22.193
to see if maybe the knife
was bought here in Bemidji.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.557
You'll make
a good chief one day.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.036
Me?

37:29.120 --> 37:31.476
What about Bill?
He's got seniority.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.196
Bill cleans his gun
with bubble bath.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.600
No, it'll be you...

37:36.680 --> 37:38.637
if you want.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.435
When you talk to the
police, just keep it simple.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.591
Thanks but no thanks,
in other words.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.114
I've already
talked to Fargo,

37:53.200 --> 37:54.759
and they want to
deal with this themselves.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.954
They're sending guys.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.554
Deal with what?

37:58.640 --> 38:01.394
He was in a whorehouse.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.880
I'm glad he's dead.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.474
Ma, don't talk like that.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.677
Yeah,
Ma, don't talk like that.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.672
Makes me live in the North Pole,

38:08.760 --> 38:11.229
and then he's got the nerve to...

38:11.320 --> 38:13.630
I'm not kidding.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.951
I'm gonna sing at his funeral.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.510
Mmm-hmm.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.790
Mr. Mickey,
you have a phone call.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.070
She said me, you doofus.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.633
Can I come?
No.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.758
Jeez! Just stay
here with Ma.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.878
Hello.
<i>Mickey?</i>

38:50.960 --> 38:54.158
Louis Grossman,
your dad's estate attorney.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.230
First of all...

38:56.360 --> 38:59.114
I'd like to say
how sorry I am for your loss.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.873
Okay.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.191
<i>Next thing is...</i>

39:03.280 --> 39:06.000
I'm responsible for
overseeing the dispersal

39:06.080 --> 39:08.470
of your dad's vast estate.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.550
You mean the money?

39:11.640 --> 39:12.756
<i>Right.</i>

39:12.840 --> 39:18.837
Money, real estate, holdings,
automobiles and...

39:18.960 --> 39:22.032
Well, there's no delicate
way to put this.

39:22.120 --> 39:25.318
The will was very clear.

39:25.400 --> 39:29.030
Your dad decided to give everything 
to your younger brother Moe.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.349
Are you kidding?

39:30.440 --> 39:31.760
<i>I know it's hard to hear...</i>

39:31.840 --> 39:35.470
but the will was very specific.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.719
Quote, I leave the entirety of
my vast estate

39:39.800 --> 39:43.635
to my second-born
and favorite son Moe.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.560
<i>That's sweet.</i>

39:46.640 --> 39:49.155
<i>He must have
really loved that boy.</i>

39:49.280 --> 39:50.873
Anyway, that's it.

39:50.960 --> 39:54.237
Once again,
I'm sorry for your loss.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.279
If you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to call me.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.558
Well, like I said, Mrs. Hess, 
we're checking some things on our end,

40:05.640 --> 40:07.074
but if there's anything
you could tell us

40:07.160 --> 40:08.435
about your husband's business...

40:08.520 --> 40:10.193
I appreciate the visit, Chief,

40:10.280 --> 40:13.193
but Mrs. Hess had no kind of 
involvement with Sam's business.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.237
Frankly, she's mystified.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.119
Her husband being a pillar of
the community and all.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.236
I mean, heck,

40:19.320 --> 40:22.154
voted Bemidji Businessman of the Year,
1996 and '98.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.515
Who... who was it?

40:23.600 --> 40:24.750
I'll tell you there.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.354
Yeah.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.591
Like I said, it's a puzzler.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.558
'Course, we both
know some of your boys

40:30.640 --> 40:32.438
have had run-ins with
the law in the past.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.591
Stolen merchandise
charges and the like.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.956
And, you know,
the Staties had that case

40:37.080 --> 40:38.480
as to maybe your
outfit's got ties

40:38.560 --> 40:41.792
to that crime
syndicate out of Fargo.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.270
You're gonna stand here...
Let me get this straight.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.430
You're gonna stand here

40:45.520 --> 40:48.240
and call the victim a criminal in 
front of his wife, his kids?

40:48.320 --> 40:50.277
Well, now, no one's calling
anyone a criminal.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.431
Just trying to figure
out what happened.

40:52.520 --> 40:56.036
Chief! 217! 217!

41:19.080 --> 41:20.560
What the heck?

41:36.360 --> 41:37.396
Heya, Lester.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.880
Hiya, Bo.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.429
Jeez, what happened
to your face there?

41:41.560 --> 41:43.313
You know that spot
near the fire station?

41:43.400 --> 41:44.516
Where they wash the trucks?

41:44.600 --> 41:45.590
Yep.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.718
Slipped on the ice.

41:48.800 --> 41:52.794
Say, Lester, I need you to
pull the file on Sam Hess.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.718
On who now?

41:55.800 --> 41:58.838
Sam Hess. You know, owns the truck
depot over on Winslow.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.957
You know, big fella.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.639
Yeah, well, he's dead.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.795
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.917
Shame. It's a big policy.

42:08.680 --> 42:12.469
Murder, they're saying.
Stabbed to death is what I heard.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.234
You okay there, Lester?

42:17.120 --> 42:20.158
Sure.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.436
Sure... You know
I went to high school with him?

42:22.560 --> 42:23.550
You don't say.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.030
Well, anyway, I need you
to pull the policy on that.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.476
I have to get on the phone
with his wife later.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.030
Uh...

43:03.000 --> 43:04.320
Did you...

43:05.840 --> 43:09.675
Jeez.
Did you really kill him? Sam?

43:09.760 --> 43:11.911
Oh, my God.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.434
Is Sam dead?

43:15.480 --> 43:17.949
How do you feel about that?

43:18.040 --> 43:19.713
Well, I mean...

43:19.800 --> 43:23.635
of course, it's...
you know, a tragedy.

43:23.720 --> 43:24.949
Well, why'd you kill him then?

43:25.080 --> 43:26.514
Now hold on a second!

43:28.520 --> 43:29.670
I never--

43:29.760 --> 43:31.956
Well, actually, you did.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.599
Remember, yes or no?

43:33.680 --> 43:35.239
I never said yes.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.356
Didn't say no.

43:37.160 --> 43:40.278
No, that won't-- Come on.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.714
That...
In a court of law--

43:41.800 --> 43:43.439
Who said anything
about a court of law?

43:43.520 --> 43:44.510
Look, I just mean...

43:45.680 --> 43:47.399
I... Jeez.

43:49.400 --> 43:53.110
And he had a wife,
you know, and those boys.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.715
Lester, he put you in a 
barrel and rolled you on the road.

43:58.200 --> 44:03.320
Your problem is you spent your 
whole life thinking there are rules.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.596
There aren't.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.637
We used to be gorillas.

44:07.720 --> 44:10.952
All we had is what
we could take and defend.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.112
The truth is you're more of a man 
today than you were yesterday.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.319
How do you figure?

44:18.080 --> 44:21.551
It's a red tide, Lester,
this life of ours.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.831
The shit they make us eat...

44:28.040 --> 44:29.679
day after day,

44:29.760 --> 44:34.073
the boss, the wife,
et cetera, wearing us down.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.516
If you don't stand up to it,

44:36.600 --> 44:41.356
let 'em know you're still an 
ape deep down, where it counts.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.035
You're just gonna
get washed away.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.791
Phone call, Chief.
It's the wife.

45:02.720 --> 45:03.870
Hey, hon.
<i>White.</i>

45:03.960 --> 45:05.519
White, what?

45:05.640 --> 45:08.314
I decided we're gonna
paint the nursery white.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.436
<i>It's already white.</i>

45:09.560 --> 45:13.315
Well...
I want to paint it again.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.313
The baby's room should have a new coat,
don't you think?

45:16.440 --> 45:17.920
I do.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.116
Any particular shade?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.714
What do you mean?

45:20.800 --> 45:23.838
Well, you got your
bright white, your snow white...

45:23.920 --> 45:25.320
Eggshell.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.877
Right, there's eggshell.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.156
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.230
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

45:33.320 --> 45:34.310
<i>Why don't I stop
by the hardware</i>

45:34.400 --> 45:35.390
<i>and pick up some
different shades</i>

45:35.480 --> 45:36.516
and we'll figure
it out tonight?

45:36.600 --> 45:38.319
We're having a baby, Vern.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.039
<i>That's true.</i>

45:40.120 --> 45:42.999
No, I mean it's
finally sinking in.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.070
We're gonna have a baby.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.914
I can't wait.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.673
I'll see you soon.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.240
Is there anything else
you need there?

45:56.000 --> 45:57.957
Nope, I'm good.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.759
<i>Come in, Chief.</i>

46:05.840 --> 46:07.240
This is Vern. Go ahead.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.595
<i>Chief,
I'm over at the hospital.</i>

46:08.680 --> 46:10.672
<i>I was checking on
the Hess boy and--</i>

46:10.760 --> 46:11.796
How is he?

46:11.880 --> 46:14.998
<i>You know, broken collarbone.
Got his bell rung pretty good.</i>

46:16.160 --> 46:17.435
That's a shame.
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:17.520 --> 46:20.433
Hey, so I got to
talking to Sue Roundtree

46:20.520 --> 46:22.910
and I asked her if they 
had any head injuries lately,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.117
you know, my theory about
the driver and the wreck,

46:25.200 --> 46:27.556
and she says they did...
yesterday.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.832
<i>Real peculiar fella, she says.
Real intense.</i>

46:30.920 --> 46:32.115
<i>And here's where
it gets interesting.</i>

46:32.200 --> 46:34.112
'Cause she says the fella with
the head injury

46:34.200 --> 46:37.034
was talking to another fella
about Sam Hess.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.480
Yeah?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

46:39.560 --> 46:41.472
Says the two was
thick as thieves.

46:41.560 --> 46:43.472
So suddenly I'm thinking
maybe these two cases,

46:43.560 --> 46:44.789
maybe they're connected, huh?

46:45.600 --> 46:47.592
Could be.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.717
She say who
the other fella was?

46:49.800 --> 46:51.996
<i>Lester Nygaard.</i>

46:52.120 --> 46:53.110
Really?

46:53.920 --> 46:54.910
You know him?

46:55.040 --> 46:56.269
<i>Sure, I know Lester.</i>

46:57.000 --> 46:59.151
Sells insurance
over at Bo's shop.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.277
Yeah, yeah, I called over
and they're closed,

47:01.360 --> 47:04.000
so I was gonna go
by Lester's place.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.037
<i>No, I know Lester.
I'll do it.</i>

47:06.920 --> 47:09.196
You call it a day.
Good work.

47:25.560 --> 47:27.313
Lester?

47:27.400 --> 47:29.710
In the basement.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.036
Whatcha doing, hon?

47:43.120 --> 47:46.192
I'm... trying to
fix the darn thing.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.159
It looks like
the motor mount broke.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.038
You sure you know
what you're doing?

47:52.120 --> 47:54.919
It seems pretty
straightforward.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.992
So, you want to
give her a try?

47:57.080 --> 47:58.958
There's nothing in it.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.316
For a test, I'm saying.

48:21.480 --> 48:22.834
Turn it off.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.600
Turn it off!

48:38.720 --> 48:40.871
You killed it.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.071
You killed my washing machine.
No, I was--

48:43.160 --> 48:46.597
It was the...
the tide, you know?

48:46.680 --> 48:50.435
I was standing up to the--
I was...

48:50.520 --> 48:52.398
I was being a man.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.594
But you're not
a man, Lester.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.715
You're not even half a man.

48:58.840 --> 49:01.514
Honestly, I don't know what 
got into me marrying you.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.278
My mom said,
"Don't do it, Pearl."

49:04.360 --> 49:07.831
She said, "He's the kind of boy
that loses all the time.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.357
"And you know what those boys 
grow up to be, don't you? Losers."

49:13.040 --> 49:14.190
Take that back.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.510
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

49:18.800 --> 49:21.110
You can't even face me
when we're having sex.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.156
Now, hold on!

49:22.240 --> 49:24.152
That is you not facing me!

49:24.240 --> 49:26.516
That's so I can
picture a real man.

49:26.600 --> 49:27.590
Oh!

49:32.440 --> 49:34.671
You take that back.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.798
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

49:38.880 --> 49:39.870
Oh.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.475
You gonna hit me?

49:42.320 --> 49:43.310
That's a--

49:47.960 --> 49:48.950
Oh.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.596
Oh, jeez.

50:03.160 --> 50:06.995
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.796
Oh, God.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.110
Oh, God.

51:15.320 --> 51:17.073
Yeah, it's me.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.277
You gotta help me out.
I've done something bad.

51:19.360 --> 51:20.760
<i>Leroy's Motor Inn.</i>

51:20.840 --> 51:24.470
Hi. Can...
can I have Room 23 please?

51:29.640 --> 51:31.074
<i>Yeah?</i>
Yeah.

51:31.160 --> 51:34.756
Yeah, it's... it's...
it's me. It's Lester.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.071
She's... My wife...
my wife, she's...

51:37.160 --> 51:38.480
Oh, hell!

51:39.840 --> 51:42.594
Look, I think I...

51:42.680 --> 51:45.195
She's in the basement
dead and...

51:45.280 --> 51:49.354
Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.591
<i>Lester, have you
been a bad boy?</i>

51:53.560 --> 51:55.119
Jeez.

51:55.200 --> 51:59.240
Yeah, I took the hammer and...

51:59.320 --> 52:04.440
Look, can you come over?
I'm on Willow Creek Drive, number 613.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.716
Please! Please?

52:09.600 --> 52:11.159
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

52:11.240 --> 52:13.755
Thank you. Thank you!

52:16.560 --> 52:17.880
Here we go.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.558
What did you do?

52:40.200 --> 52:42.271
You killed her!

52:46.600 --> 52:49.320
What did you do?

52:49.400 --> 52:50.959
You killed her.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.993
You killed her.

53:19.960 --> 53:20.950
Evening, Lester.

53:30.920 --> 53:34.470
It's supposed to get down to 
negative 10 tonight, I hear.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.712
Is Pearl home?
No.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.190
No, she's at my brother's.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.436
Okay, then.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.918
How's the nose?

53:46.000 --> 53:47.719
This...

53:47.800 --> 53:49.996
It hurts.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.554
How'd it happen, anyway?

53:51.640 --> 53:53.233
Slipped, over by
the fire station.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.119
You go to the hospital?

53:56.200 --> 53:57.520
Yeah, they set it.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.478
You talk to anyone
while you were there?

54:01.520 --> 54:02.670
What do you mean?

54:02.800 --> 54:04.393
Well, the reason I'm here...

54:04.480 --> 54:05.630
I'm not sure you heard.

54:05.760 --> 54:08.195
Sam Hess got killed
last night at the Lucky Penny.

54:08.280 --> 54:11.000
Nasty business.
Yeah.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.275
And, well...

54:12.360 --> 54:15.319
I heard you were talking to another 
fella about Hess before he died...

54:16.240 --> 54:19.199
over at the hospital.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.396
No, I don't think so.

54:20.480 --> 54:23.871
What was his name again...
the other fella?

54:29.680 --> 54:32.878
You okay, Lester?
You seem a bit... seem a bit jumpy.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.680
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's just, you know...

54:35.760 --> 54:38.832
Pearl is gonna be
home soon and...

54:44.080 --> 54:46.879
Lester, listen to
me very carefully.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.270
I need you to get
down on the ground.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.430
Wait just a second.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.590
Lester, on the ground!

54:51.680 --> 54:52.955
This is not
what it looks like.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.520
Now, hold on. Hold on.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.717
Don't...
don't go down there.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.473
Don't...
There's nothing down--

54:58.560 --> 55:01.029
That's not-- I didn't do nothing.
I didn't... I just got home.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.191
I just got home and...
There's nothing down there.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.913
That's not-- I
didn't do nothing.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.320
I didn't do nothing!
I didn't do nothing!

55:06.400 --> 55:08.710
I just came home.
I just came home.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.954
This is Chief Thurman.
I'm at 613 Willow Creek Drive.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.072
Requesting back up.
613 Willow Creek--

55:19.560 --> 55:20.789
<i>Chief?</i>

55:20.920 --> 55:22.240
<i>Chief?</i>

55:23.600 --> 55:24.636
<i>Chief?</i>

55:36.920 --> 55:38.195
Any more?

55:40.440 --> 55:43.433
Lester, are there
any more cops?

55:43.800 --> 55:45.075
Mmm-mmm.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.432
What did you tell him?

56:05.520 --> 56:07.000
Nothing.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.117
He... he asked about Sam.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.120
You got any more shells for this thing?
No.

56:15.440 --> 56:16.794
Is that the basement?

56:16.960 --> 56:17.950
Mmm.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.150
Jeez.

56:52.320 --> 56:54.915
The police are here.

56:55.680 --> 57:00.550
I said the police are here!
What do we do?

57:17.760 --> 57:19.752
Officer down.

57:19.840 --> 57:21.911
613 Willow Creek Drive.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.271
<i>Roger that. 
Confirming code 3.</i>

57:26.400 --> 57:27.516
Bemidji Police!

57:27.600 --> 57:28.670
Oh, my God.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.436
<i>All units,</i>

57:33.520 --> 57:37.912
<i>officer in need of immediate 
assistance at 613 Willow Creek Drive.</i>

57:48.280 --> 57:51.114
Bemidji Police!

57:51.200 --> 57:55.319
If there's someone in the house, 
come out with your hands up.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.391
Molly!

58:58.480 --> 58:59.834
Down here!

59:01.480 --> 59:03.119
Husband's alive.

59:06.680 --> 59:07.670
Oh, jeez!

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.590
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.520
Yeah, Dad here.
Come back.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.000
<i>Vikings up by 13. Over.</i>

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.520
What happened? Over.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.434
<i>Kicked in another
field goal. Over.</i>

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.036
Sweet.
You brush your teeth? Over.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.271
<i>Yeah. Over.</i>

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.795
Homework? Over.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.436
<i>Did my math and science. I still have 
to do English. Over.</i>

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.239
Okay. Well, as soon
as the game's over.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.437
Over.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.756
Evening, Officer.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.360
Evening.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.478
License and registration,
please.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.710
We could do it that way.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.232
You ask me for my papers,

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.279
I tell you it's not my car,
that I borrowed it,

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.637
see where things
go from there.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.200
We could do that...

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.198
or you could go get in your car
and drive away.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.479
Now, why would I do that?

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.229
Because some roads
you shouldn't go down.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.711
Because maps used to say,
"There be dragons here."

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.634
Now they don't.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.320
But that don't mean
the dragons aren't there.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.074
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.431
You step out of the car,
please, sir?

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.198
How old's your kid?

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.034
I said, step out of the car.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.157
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.076
Let me tell you what's going to happen,
Officer Grimly.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.832
I'm going to roll my window up.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.834
Then I'm gonna drive away
and you're gonna go home to your daughter,

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.910
and every few years,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.754
you're gonna look at
her face and know that you're alive

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.198
because you chose not to go
down a certain road on a certain night,

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.035
that you chose to walk into the 
light instead of into the darkness.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.797
Do you understand me?

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.272
Sir.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.632
I'm rolling up my window.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.720
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.193
<i>Dad...</i>

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.431
<i>are you there? Over.</i>

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.670
So, I got two kinds of sandwiches.
Tuna and turkey.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.750
Tuna's for the fish...

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.558
unless you think
they'd think that's cannibalism.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.637
You know, I've been looking for 
more help in the restaurant.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.680
You know, someone to seat customers 
and answer the phone.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.515
A hostess?

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.557
Is that what they call it?
Yeah.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.997
Anyway...

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.756
not sure if that's something 
you might be interested in.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.471
I'm a police officer, Dad.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.119
Well, sure, I know that.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.953
I also know that
people in this world

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.475
are... less inclined
to shoot a hostess

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.472
than, say,
an officer of the law.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.914
That's true.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.799
So, that mean you're gonna help
your old man out?

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.830
Nope.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.313
But maybe you could
put that in the ad.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.515
Listen, on second thought,
I think I'm gonna head into work.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.910
Rain check on the fishing?

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.678
Sounds good.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.036
Love you, Dad.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.635
Love you too, hon.
