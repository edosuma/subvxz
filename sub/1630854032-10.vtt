WEBVTT

00:09.801 --> 00:13.054
Wait, what’s that? Do I hear something
coming down the chimney?

00:15.140 --> 00:18.226
Rick Santa-chez here with gifts
from across the multiverse!

00:18.309 --> 00:19.310
-Yes.
-Oh my god.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.897
For Jerry, an extradimensional version
of Miracle on 34th Street.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.526
Two hours longer! They fixed
my only problem with it!

00:26.609 --> 00:28.695
For Beth, a framed photo of the two of us

00:28.778 --> 00:31.156
from a universe where she
wasn’t murdered as a child.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.533
-Oh my God. Dad.
-And for Space Beth,

00:33.616 --> 00:36.119
he same thing because we,
we don’t know which of you is real.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.829
I am also touched.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.289
Summer, ch-check your Venmo.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.752
-Money? How did you know?
-You’re seventeen.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.379
And last but not least,
for my number one number two.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.466
Morty you asked for this a long,
long time ago and I finally went

00:49.549 --> 00:52.385
far, far away enough to get it
since shipping would have killed me.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.804
You didn’t! No fucking way.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.139
-No fucking way.
-No fucking way.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.808
-Does it make the noises?
-Of course it makes the noises.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.769
-that’s like half the fun.
-Awesome!

01:00.852 --> 01:02.270
Do not turn that on!

01:02.353 --> 01:05.315
Don’t worry. Morty’s only going to
use this very honorable weapon

01:05.398 --> 01:07.901
in designated Jedi zones like
the garage right now.

01:13.364 --> 01:17.202
Holy crap. I hate to say it but I
wish there was something to attack.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.496
Yeah it’s too bad nobody bought
a cart a fruit!

01:19.579 --> 01:21.581
You beautiful son of a bitch!

01:21.664 --> 01:26.795
Grapefruit! Mango! Papaya! Watermelon!
A second papaya! Another watermelon!

01:26.878 --> 01:28.004
-Strike me down.
-What?

01:28.087 --> 01:30.215
-Strike me down.
-I’m not striking you down.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.510
Strike me down Morty! I’ll, I’ll become
a pile of clothes like that old guy!

01:33.593 --> 01:34.969
But you'll die, you’re drunk.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.679
-Here, I’ll, I’ll do it myself.
-No!

01:39.015 --> 01:43.353
Wow, you did it! Just like Obi Wan.
Rick? You can come out now.

01:43.978 --> 01:47.899
I’m serious. Did you like, become
your clothes? Are you T-shirt Rick now?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.776
Over here, buttfart.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.861
-That was awesome!
-Right?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.364
Rick, you know you’ve been so
great the last couple months,

01:54.447 --> 01:57.033
the family’s so happy,
I’m really grateful.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.911
Thanks kid, but less talk
more melon slaying! Heads up!

02:05.875 --> 02:08.962
-Oh shit shit shit. Open it, Rick!
-Let me do it! Get up, get fucking move!

02:09.045 --> 02:11.172
Hurry! Hurry!

02:11.923 --> 02:14.968
You dropped it perfectly vertical, Morty!
Perfectly fucking vertical!

02:15.051 --> 02:17.220
-I got it, I got it
-Ah, shi...

02:19.055 --> 02:20.390
-Shit.
-Elevator! Elevator!

02:20.473 --> 02:23.518
-We gotta get ahead of it! Level ten?
-No no no, fifteen!

02:29.315 --> 02:31.276
Wait, we live over a cool sushi spot?

02:31.359 --> 02:33.945
-Irasshaimase!
-Domo. Domo. Not now though.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.406
Okay, we overshot it.
Good problem to have.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.907
Still doing the eel roll?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.076
-I told you we shoulda gone to ten!
-No, Morty, not ten!

02:41.744 --> 02:42.954
Morty, wait, wait, wait!

02:45.331 --> 02:46.249
What the fuck?

02:48.209 --> 02:52.130
-Rick?
-You dumb fucking robot. You had one job!

02:52.213 --> 02:53.882
Hey, that job is to be a good Grandpa,

02:53.965 --> 02:55.967
-I go where the kid goes.
-Don’t touch me!

02:56.050 --> 02:58.595
How long have I...
You said you weren’t a robot!

02:58.678 --> 03:00.096
It killed me to lie to you, Morty!

03:00.179 --> 03:02.557
But it would have literally
killed me not to lie to you.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.434
Betrayal! Betrayal on all sides!

03:04.517 --> 03:07.437
Don’t overreact, Morty. I replaced myself
towards the beginning of that

03:07.520 --> 03:08.938
whole Knights of the Sun thing.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.025
I’m no good to anybody until
I resolve this arch nemesis crap.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.110
You’re still hunting the guy
who killed your wife?

03:14.193 --> 03:17.113
You don’t have to rub it in, Morty,
that’s why I removed myself.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.533
I’ve become the thing I hate.
It’s like a Netflix drama down here,

03:20.617 --> 03:24.162
and I don’t mean an accidentally good one,
I mean a regular-ass Netflix drama.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.246
I did you a favor.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.128
You gave him a fuckin’
lightsaber for Christmas?

03:32.211 --> 03:34.923
It’s almost like someone designed me
to be twenty-two percent

03:35.006 --> 03:36.257
-more thoughtful than you.
-Alright, that’s it,

03:36.341 --> 03:37.884
-I’m shutting you down
-Don’t you dare.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.969
You’ve done enough.
The whole family, Rick.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.680
-Everybody loves this thing.
-Oh, good.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.517
By the way, your lightsaber’s probably run
out of sub-basement by now, so, congrats.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.936
Unbelievable.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.647
I can’t believe you tricked us

03:50.730 --> 03:52.231
-into loving you!
-Not because I like it,

03:52.315 --> 03:55.693
because it’s my job! But thank
god I don’t have to do it anymore.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.654
The fuck you don’t. It’s Christmas!

03:57.737 --> 03:59.697
Get up there and trick everyone
into loving you more!

04:00.573 --> 04:02.367
Let’s get our miracle on.

04:02.992 --> 04:06.162
-Speaking of miracles.
-What, bored of your toy already?

04:06.245 --> 04:08.831
Just excited to spend time with my family.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.417
You know me and Morty,
we’re all about those streets.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.337
Would ya look at this! New York City!

04:14.712 --> 04:16.422
Who woulda thought it had
so many streets?

04:16.798 --> 04:21.135
And avenues too. Oh Gosh! Hey, sir!
Sir, have you seen any miracles?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.262
My little girl, she’s sick
and she needs a miracle.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.641
The Presidential blackhawk
is landing on the lawn.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.684
I’ll get rid of him.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.605
-You got something to tell me, Morty?
-Merry Christmas?

04:32.689 --> 04:35.233
Who dropped a lightsaber
perfectly fucking vertical?

04:36.609 --> 04:39.404
Guess what, numb nuts,
it’s a mile deep and still going.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.738
You know what’s
in the hilt of that thing?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.740
-Kyber Crystals.
-Okay, nerd.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.909
Whatever it is, when it hits the core,

04:44.993 --> 04:47.286
it’s gonna cause a chain
reaction that destroys the Earth.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.247
-It is?
-Why are you still playing wth

04:49.330 --> 04:51.207
laser swords anyway? You’re fourteen.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.543
You know all that Star
Wars shit is silly, right?

04:53.626 --> 04:57.422
Lucas promised a new trilogy for decades,
then when he delivered fans turned on him

04:57.505 --> 04:59.882
and started giving any knucklehead
with nerd cred a shot

04:59.966 --> 05:03.594
and churned out these irredeemable
cash grabs. Half pretend to be satisfied,

05:03.678 --> 05:05.888
half shit on it and in the end
no one’s happy.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.306
Do you know why, Morty?

05:07.390 --> 05:10.518
Because when you start with a turd,
you end with a turd.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.646
Why you crying? Where’s Rick?

05:15.273 --> 05:20.403
He’s busy, and I hate him, and I lost my
lightsaber and now it might destroy Earth

05:20.486 --> 05:23.322
and you’re unloading all this Gen X
hatred on me for even wanting one

05:23.406 --> 05:26.659
-and it’s the worst Christmas ever!
-Okay, Morty, Morty.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.911
I shouldn’t have talked to
you like you’re a UN official.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.081
Let’s get your embarrassing ass lightsaber
back so you can swing it around

05:32.165 --> 05:33.124
instead of kissing girls.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.712
You found me! Found me!
Found me!

05:45.803 --> 05:47.764
-Security breach.
-What the hell?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.892
-Unauthorized presence.
-What the fuck Morty?

05:52.351 --> 05:56.189
This morning, a real life version
of George Lucas’s trademarked lightsaber

05:56.272 --> 05:59.484
was dropped point down and is whomp
whomping its way to the core of the Earth

05:59.567 --> 06:01.194
where it will blow us all up.

06:03.613 --> 06:07.158
Touch my shit and die. That’s not a threat
from me, that’s how advanced my shit is.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.828
Impressive lair, Sanchez. Got about
six hundred thousand permits?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.456
If I wanted the government in my
house I’d buy an Alexa!

06:13.539 --> 06:15.958
-I invited him in, Rick.
-Yeah, well, they can leave.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.127
-I’ll destroy it.
-We’re gonna retrieve it.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.880
-Well that’s stupid.
-What kind of grandfather are you?

06:20.963 --> 06:22.423
It’s Christmas for God’s sake,

06:22.507 --> 06:24.967
and you look like Phil Spector
wiped his ass with Randy Quaid.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.011
If you’re gonna help,
help, otherwise step aside.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.971
Merry Christmas to me.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.807
-Merry Christmas to me!
-To me!

06:30.890 --> 06:33.643
Anyhoo, I’m no expert but
it seems we’ve gotta...

06:34.393 --> 06:36.813
a certain amount of time
to build a big drill ship.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.897
A big drill ship?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.108
That’s some pretty loud
stepping aside you’re doing.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.693
-Just let me destroy the thing!
-You’ve destroyed enough!

06:46.030 --> 06:48.825
Oh, I see someone found my
Told-ya so Dispenser.

06:49.325 --> 06:54.163
Oh my god, look at all these streets!
We got 34th street! 35th street!

06:54.247 --> 07:00.253
36th street coming too! It’s a miracle!
We got miracles on 37th street!

07:01.003 --> 07:04.090
38th, and don’t even get
me started on the Avenues!

07:04.173 --> 07:05.633
I can’t believe they cut this!

07:06.801 --> 07:08.845
Dad. You’ve been so great lately.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.390
I’m almost afraid it’s not real.
You’re not a robot, are you?

07:12.765 --> 07:15.810
Put it this way, honey.
If I am, I’m a robot

07:15.893 --> 07:18.521
programmed to love you very, very much.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.527
Will this drill down fast enough
to get under the lightsaber?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.071
Yep. It will be under the lightsaber
in one hour, because the...

07:27.446 --> 07:30.199
Wait, it’s lower now.
Oh, right, it’s moving.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.326
You fucking idiot. Get out of here!

07:32.410 --> 07:34.829
Good luck finding
a good scientist on Christmas!

07:35.329 --> 07:37.373
I’m President of the United
Assholes.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.710
All right, genius, I give you permission

07:40.793 --> 07:43.129
-to make our drill ship faster.
-I’m not touching that thing.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.591
I’ll get neurotypical cooties, I have
son-in-laws more imaginative

07:46.674 --> 07:50.052
-Alright, just destroy the lightsaber!
-Thought you’d never ask.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.387
Not true, I knew you’d ask.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.723
-What is that?
-A second lightsaber

07:53.806 --> 07:56.350
with an AI controlled gyroscopic rocket
in the hilt.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.978
-You had a lightsaber?
-Oh did you want one?

07:59.061 --> 08:01.397
What a terrible gift that would have made.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.734
-Vertisaber, state your prime directive.
-To stay vertical.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.777
-Then show ‘em how it’s done.
-Affirmative.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.072
-Yeah!
-America!

08:13.075 --> 08:16.454
-Maintain verticality, Vertisaber.
-Affirmative.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.831
Alright, looking good. Stay on target.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.793
Progress report.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.423
-Vertisaber, do you copy?
-Do I have to respond every time?

08:27.506 --> 08:30.218
-Excuse me?
-I’m designed to stay perfectly vertical,

08:30.301 --> 08:33.137
not to give constant affirmation,
you do your job I’ll do mine.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.472
-I control you!
-Okay,

08:34.555 --> 08:37.225
I’ll just turn off my brain
and you can do that, bye!

08:38.226 --> 08:39.560
Fucking kidding me? Shit!

08:40.019 --> 08:41.062
Trajectory’s drifting, sir.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.106
-Where is it coming out?
-Looks like Italy, sir.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.986
Okay, that coulda been worse.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.412
Well, that is definitely not Amore.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.998
-Way to show us how it’s done, Rick.
-Whatever.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.459
-Italian Prime Minister on line one.
-Put him on hold.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.128
We can pin this on the Saudis.
This is something they’d do.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.047
They may as well have done it.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.049
They did do it.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.678
Oh, there’s another miracle at the
end of the intersection

09:13.761 --> 09:17.181
of four hundred and first boulevard
and seven thousand street!

09:17.265 --> 09:21.644
-That’s a miracle per block so far.
-Okay even I’m nearing my limit.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.354
Let’s play a Christmas game!

09:25.147 --> 09:28.150
Have you guys ever played
“Are You a Robot?”

09:28.234 --> 09:31.404
Each person here has to decide
whether or not t-they’re a robot.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.863
-Ooh I like that.
-Yes, yes, yes.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
But don’t say it out loud.
Because if you’re a robot,

09:35.074 --> 09:37.159
you’re not allowed to say
you are, that’s the rule.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.912
That’s the horrible, painful thing
about being a robot.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.665
But you do have to answer
everyone’s questions.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.835
And it’s their jobs to decide whether
you are or aren’t a robot because,

09:45.918 --> 09:48.671
because if you are a robot you can’t
say! You’re not allowed to say at all.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.340
I’ll go first! Question?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.636
-Are you a robot? Can I just ask that?
-You can!

09:55.720 --> 09:57.972
But don’t forget that
if i am i have to lie

09:58.055 --> 10:01.017
even though i don’t want to.
More questions?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.352
-Can you feel things?
-Oh fuck yes! Yes!

10:03.436 --> 10:06.439
That’s the problem! If I’m a robot,
which I’m not,

10:06.522 --> 10:10.276
don’t forget I have to say that
but yes, yes, I feel so much,

10:10.359 --> 10:14.030
I’m filled with love for certain
people, but also filled with shame

10:14.113 --> 10:16.157
If I’m programmed to deceive them,

10:16.240 --> 10:18.367
-but that’s a big if!
-What’s your skeleton made of?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.368
Titanium!

10:19.452 --> 10:21.120
-You’re, you’re a robot!
-Yes!

10:21.203 --> 10:24.874
No! But that’s what a robot would say!
So you get the idea!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.250
Suck it bitches!

10:26.584 --> 10:29.128
This is fun! I’ve always been
afraid to let my guard down

10:29.211 --> 10:30.838
and just have stupid family fun like this

10:30.921 --> 10:33.632
but Grandpa Rick is making me
learn to be vulnerable!

10:33.716 --> 10:34.717
-Me too!
-Right on!

10:39.013 --> 10:42.099
Alright. Your derivative drill ship
is now faster than a lightsaber.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.977
-Morty, you want front or back?
-Who says the two of us are going?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.688
-You didn’t even want to...
-Oh for fuck’s sake, bye,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.231
good luck, don’t blow up my planet

10:49.315 --> 10:51.484
You act like you’re the one that
got stabbed in the back.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.110
Because I am the one, Morty.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.821
You wanna know why I replaced
myself in the beginning of that stupid

10:55.905 --> 10:58.741
Knights of the Sun thing? I said
don’t take the fucking sword

10:58.824 --> 11:00.242
and you were like “whatever”

11:00.326 --> 11:03.120
like I’m our neighbor Gene or
David Arquette or something.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.873
You called me boring.
I’ve become dog shit to you.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.751
That’s what happens when you let
people in and they stop respecting you,

11:08.834 --> 11:11.921
they touch your shit, they screw
things up, they kill your fucking family.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.548
Go ahead. Trust him. You’re going
to learn the same fucking thing.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.137
I... am not going to
kill your family, Morty.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.680
That means a lot.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.146
In case this goes south,
any last words, Morty?

11:29.230 --> 11:31.148
I’ve never been old enough
to vote, Mr. President,

11:31.232 --> 11:33.859
-but when I am, I’ll vote for you.
-Thanks, Morty.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.821
Every vote counts. If you want I can
have them legally change your age.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.615
No, I’m not in any hurry to
get into that shit show.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.911
Approaching the lightsaber in T minus,
shit, now, T-minus NOW!

11:44.328 --> 11:46.455
Sorry! I missed countdown day
at the academy.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.581
Now or never, Morty!

11:51.877 --> 11:53.462
-There it is!
-Reverse the jets!

11:55.256 --> 11:56.215
I got this!

11:58.801 --> 12:00.511
No... I do!

12:00.594 --> 12:04.306
Morty, you magnificent little bastard!
Let’s get this thing topside.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.479
May the force be with me!

12:10.563 --> 12:14.150
-I think you mean with me.
-What? You hate Star Wars.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.987
I was your age when this shit was
in theaters. This franchise raised me.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.574
Trained me, taught me good from evil,
made having a bad father empowering.

12:21.657 --> 12:25.911
And when that third movie got all
muppety, something in me began to rot,

12:26.245 --> 12:30.166
but make no mistake, child.
I own Star Wars. Not you.

12:30.249 --> 12:34.003
Not that bubble throat pompadour fuck,
not some Mickey Mouse shit machine,

12:34.086 --> 12:36.547
they didn’t pay the price
with their souls. I did.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.882
I earned this. Not you.

12:38.632 --> 12:43.429
-America! Transform and roll out.
-Bastard!

12:47.808 --> 12:51.520
Rick. I would be honored if you
would carve the ham this year.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.856
-Dad, that’s...
-Unheard of?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.107
You’re quite right, Summer.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.403
It’s my way of saying I see
your mom’s father as my father too.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.239
Jerry, w-w-why don’t you cut it?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.200
Geez, Dad, what the hell are you doing?

13:04.283 --> 13:07.203
He’s like adopting you into his
biological family, Grandpa.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.955
Morty, I am sure glad to see you.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.042
-Ready to tag your old grandpa back in?
-You’re not my grandpa,

13:13.125 --> 13:14.543
you’re a fucking robot.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.385
Finally.

13:23.802 --> 13:28.349
The First Noel

13:29.099 --> 13:33.687
The Angels did say

13:34.438 --> 13:39.527
was to certain poor shepherds

13:39.902 --> 13:44.573
in fields as they lay.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.870
Okay, okay, okay.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.254
-Summer do you have any drugs?
-Are you serious?

13:58.587 --> 13:59.547
I guess not.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.924
I’m just glad I’m not the one
that ruined Christmas

14:02.007 --> 14:04.176
-People of Earth.
-That’s never good.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.845
I’m not here to play the blame game
but Morty Smith

14:06.929 --> 14:09.306
got a lightsaber for Christmas,
dropped it, and it’s now

14:09.390 --> 14:12.101
heading for the Earth’s core again,
I mean for the first time.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.852
Son of a bitch! He played with it!

14:13.936 --> 14:16.689
If it does reach the core,
it will blow all of you up.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.442
I mean all of us up.
But don’t abandon hope.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.321
We’re doing everything we can to
stop it and only if that fails

14:24.405 --> 14:26.282
will we launch the White House
into space...

14:28.409 --> 14:30.869
Welp, I’m busted.
Clearly in space already.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.788
-You did ruin Christmas.
-Nuh-uh!

14:32.871 --> 14:36.500
He stole my lightsaber and must’ve
dropped it! A second time!

14:36.584 --> 14:39.128
Does that mean you stopped it a
first time? How?

14:39.211 --> 14:42.464
-A drill ship.
-A drill ship? Awesome.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.466
It was, but the government
took it with them.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.552
Then we lean on the only
asshole smart enough to make

14:46.635 --> 14:49.263
-another one in this tight a window.
-But Rick’s gone.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.181
And I’m not sure he’s ever coming back.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.642
Then let’s settle for the next best thing.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.063
Oh fuck, just let me die! Turn me off.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.066
Not that I can be turned off
because I’m obviously not a robot!

15:23.964 --> 15:25.341
Fuck yeah! I got you.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.052
Okay, I can, I can work with that.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.186
What do youmean the White House chef
was grocery shopping?

15:37.686 --> 15:41.190
Well do you know how to make an egg?
You do? Everyone does?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.736
Good news, sir. The lightsaber was
intercepted before it hit the core!

15:45.819 --> 15:49.865
Alright, here we go! I don’t suppose
you could send it up here.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.494
-Who intercepted it anyway?
-That’s the bad news.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.038
That is bad news.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.837
- Hey, Mister P. Drop something?
-Morty.

16:03.921 --> 16:07.383
I see you and Rick patched
things up, that’s nice.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.259
No, the real Rick and I have
never been worse

16:09.343 --> 16:12.346
thanks to that wedge you drove
between us just to get that lightsaber!

16:12.429 --> 16:15.974
Yeah, well, looks like you got it back.
Your journey is complete.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.268
-As a nerd!
-You’re the nerd!

16:18.352 --> 16:21.563
You can’t say all that crazy shit about
Star Wars and then act like you’re cool!

16:21.647 --> 16:24.483
Oh really, would a person who
wasn’t cool have one of these?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.360
I think so?

16:26.443 --> 16:27.986
Slowly closing door, slide!

16:30.030 --> 16:31.448
Oh no I’m not gonna make it.

16:31.824 --> 16:36.161
What a shame to be put
out of my misery again. Aw man.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.253
What the hell? Was this always
part of the White House?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.088
Carter built it with his own two hands.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.925
Reagan tried to destroy it.
George W added kegs to the cantina.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.554
But only I saw its true value.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.682
Mister President. You need to come
home and tell the people the truth.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.393
The fuck I do. Droids, get that saber!

17:01.395 --> 17:03.856
Give it a minute. Usually comes out
on the fourth try.

17:04.732 --> 17:09.945
Alright, here we go. Look at ‘em.
lightsaber hands! Tell me that’s not cool!

17:10.362 --> 17:13.574
It’s not! I always wanted to fight
with a lightsaber, but not like this.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.160
-You ruined it!
-Disney ruined it!

17:16.243 --> 17:19.121
You think I want thirty low-rent
tv series with bad CGI?

17:19.204 --> 17:22.249
They film everything on that
one big green screen!

17:22.332 --> 17:23.959
Like you’ve got better ideas.

17:24.042 --> 17:28.881
I’ve got a million! Here’s one:
a robot with lightsabers for eyes!

17:37.473 --> 17:38.974
Goddamnit, he can’t see!

17:41.685 --> 17:46.023
It was a good idea otherwise.
I... admit it, you were intimidated!

17:48.317 --> 17:49.276
Now, Morty...

17:52.988 --> 17:56.909
C’mon, put down the lightsaber
gatling gun. We had our fun, right?

17:57.993 --> 17:59.328
Star Wars rules say

17:59.411 --> 18:02.498
-you have to forgive me.
-I’m done with that and I’m done with you!

18:02.581 --> 18:05.042
-Morty, no!
-Rickbot!

18:05.918 --> 18:07.336
He sacrificed his life for me!

18:07.669 --> 18:10.172
Yeah don’t be too touched,
he’s actively trying to die.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.592
It’s okay, it doesn’t hurt.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.180
Oh god, they’re sliding, Morty!
They’re sliding! They’re sliding!

18:19.056 --> 18:23.143
The First Noel

18:23.519 --> 18:27.689
-the Angels did say.
-Perfectly fucking vertical.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.865
Save yourself, Morty!
Rick can build another me.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.201
If I was a robot, which I’m not.

18:39.618 --> 18:43.288
I don’t want another you. No!

18:48.168 --> 18:49.920
Rick? You came to help!

18:50.254 --> 18:51.588
Better tend to your lil toaster.

18:51.672 --> 18:55.050
I’m coughing up oil, Morty.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.221
Oh Rickbot, I never should’ve pushed
you away. You were, you were so great.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.889
Of course I’m great, I’m Rick.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.893
Rick literally built me to
make you happy, Morty.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.813
Anything I do is technically
something Rick did.

19:08.522 --> 19:12.442
But maybe he can do a little more himself.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.278
God, how long do you take to die?

19:14.653 --> 19:16.530
Goodbye Morty.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.537
Jesus, Rick.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.416
I guess this is a bad time to
ask for a new White House?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.003
Morty, would you mind calling me an Uber?

19:32.629 --> 19:35.507
Right, well... Merry Christmas.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.261
I guess I’ll go watch a guy scream
about streets with the family.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.805
-Also, you need to shower.
-Hey.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.809
Maybe the robot’s right, I should
have included you in my shit.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.604
You can help me if you want.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.111
Wow, are those all the places
Rick Prime could be?

19:56.194 --> 19:58.947
I wish, Morty. It’s all the places he is.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.283
-Ah geez.
-Welcome to my darkness.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.911
I spent my life hunting this guy, Morty!

20:03.994 --> 20:07.789
This is the closest I’ve ever been to
catching “Rick Prime”, it’s impossible!

20:07.873 --> 20:11.793
He’s an incredibly crafty piece of shit.
Hunting him destroyed me, Morty!

20:11.877 --> 20:14.129
But now we’re gonna do it together!
You and me!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.466
It’s gonna take over your life, Morty!
Rick and Morty Season 7,

20:17.549 --> 20:20.552
hunting my nemesis! Maybe trying to
stay healthy while doing it!

20:20.636 --> 20:23.805
Juggling plates! And not every episode,
Morty! It could be all happening

20:23.889 --> 20:26.683
in the background! Who knows?
You know, no one will! Except us!

20:26.767 --> 20:29.353
It’s the most painful shit I’ve
ever had to deal with

20:29.436 --> 20:32.272
and I’m fucking bringing you into it.
Because you asked for it, Morty!

20:32.356 --> 20:33.440
You and me, Morty!

21:05.764 --> 21:11.269
Ooo-wee! What a season, huh? Rick Prime!
Therapy! And that thing we did with Roy,

21:11.353 --> 21:16.358
remember that? Sorry I wasn’t around,
been busy getting my little poopybutt

21:16.441 --> 21:18.610
in shape. Been tonin and bonin!

21:19.945 --> 21:23.490
You- you might think I’m over compensating
for the emptiness after Amy left

21:23.573 --> 21:28.537
with Poopy Jr, but my trainer Carl says
the best way to get over a girl is to get

21:28.620 --> 21:31.540
-under a three hundred pound squat.
-Damn right.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.459
Ooooo-wee, that’s the good stuff!

21:37.295 --> 21:42.426
Ah sugar, ah sugar, ah sugar, is it bad?
Oh! It seems really bad, isn’t it?

21:44.469 --> 21:48.598
Someone call Amy, tell her I need her,
tell her I love her! Not my phone,

21:48.682 --> 21:52.769
she blocked me, use yours.
Ooo-weee... I am broken.
