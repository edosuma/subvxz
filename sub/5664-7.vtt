WEBVTT

00:00.128 --> 00:02.059
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.155 --> 00:03.555
Boy, you look like your father

00:03.556 --> 00:06.145
when we were shavetails
down at Parris Island.

00:06.146 --> 00:08.013
So, what are these,

00:08.015 --> 00:09.682
bank accounts, transit numbers?

00:09.683 --> 00:11.451
That's Liechtenstein and that's Geneva.

00:11.452 --> 00:12.886
It was your father's idea.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.633
The man I'm working to take down,

00:14.634 --> 00:16.119
his name is Atticus Nevins.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.888
It looks like you already are a part of it.

00:17.889 --> 00:19.890
What the hell is going on here?

00:19.891 --> 00:22.754
Got a name on our Shard
thief, Sophie Foster.

00:22.755 --> 00:24.215
A couple people heard about the job,

00:24.216 --> 00:26.684
said Atticus Nevins was footing the bill.

00:26.685 --> 00:28.619
I'm gonna dig into him
and see what I can find.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.721
- The Shard.
- You're making a big mistake.

00:30.722 --> 00:32.223
That's my specialty.

00:32.223 --> 00:34.463
Trees are often associated

00:34.464 --> 00:37.047
with the entrance to the underworld.

00:37.048 --> 00:39.268
She's preparing something.

00:39.365 --> 00:42.200
I fear her return is inevitable.

00:42.201 --> 00:43.381
The only question is

00:43.382 --> 00:44.581
what insidious plan

00:44.582 --> 00:46.382
does she have for her return?

00:47.799 --> 00:50.668
Forward!

00:50.669 --> 00:52.570
Know thyself.

00:54.239 --> 00:56.674
Know thy enemy.

00:57.909 --> 00:59.476
Know these things

00:59.477 --> 01:03.781
and one need not fear 1,000 battles.

01:03.782 --> 01:06.650
For there will come

01:06.651 --> 01:09.954
1,000 victories.

01:14.861 --> 01:16.305
The Art of War.

01:16.306 --> 01:18.206
You've read Sun Tzu.

01:18.207 --> 01:20.242
Gave us copies at the academy.

01:20.243 --> 01:21.309
Then you will recognize this.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.245
"A clever fighter is not one who wins,

01:23.246 --> 01:25.146
but one who..."

01:27.116 --> 01:29.084
Checkmate.

01:29.085 --> 01:31.119
"...one who wins with ease."

01:31.120 --> 01:34.256
You know a counter to Philidor's open?

01:34.257 --> 01:35.757
Corbin taught me the game.

01:35.758 --> 01:37.292
He said it's, uh, best

01:37.293 --> 01:39.127
if I just feel my way.

01:39.128 --> 01:40.762
- "Feel your way"?
- Mm-hmm.

01:40.763 --> 01:44.299
And that nothing beats a good blindside.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.567
Crane?

01:45.568 --> 01:48.169
You seem a little off your game lately.

01:50.273 --> 01:51.773
I don't mean just the chess.

01:51.774 --> 01:54.542
Well, yes, it has been

01:54.543 --> 01:56.411
a particularly trying few days.

01:56.412 --> 01:58.346
United States Immigration

01:58.347 --> 02:00.282
may well be Dante's tenth circle of Hell.

02:00.283 --> 02:02.117
The archives

02:02.118 --> 02:04.085
remains at risk from developers.

02:04.086 --> 02:05.854
All hurdles you'll overcome.

02:05.855 --> 02:07.856
And then there is Pandora.

02:07.857 --> 02:09.357
My research has yielded precious little

02:09.358 --> 02:11.092
to explain where the portal in her tree

02:11.093 --> 02:12.294
may have taken her.

02:12.295 --> 02:15.897
And I fear, contrary to the popular saying,

02:15.898 --> 02:19.567
what we do not know may very well hurt us.

02:23.639 --> 02:26.207
Hey, Mills.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.309
Danny.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.177
Agent Reynolds.

02:29.178 --> 02:31.346
Ah, sorry to interrupt your morning.

02:31.347 --> 02:33.214
Not at all.

02:34.317 --> 02:35.817
Philidor, huh?

02:35.818 --> 02:37.539
Easy to beat if you're not careful.

02:39.322 --> 02:40.622
Yes, I know.

02:40.623 --> 02:41.990
It's, uh...

02:41.991 --> 02:43.591
It's... it's easy.

02:43.592 --> 02:45.160
Everyone knows how to...

02:45.161 --> 02:46.328
Oh, I think my kettle's boiled.

02:46.329 --> 02:48.163
Tea? No? Tea? No?

02:48.164 --> 02:51.132
No? Tea?

02:51.133 --> 02:53.134
I got to say I still don't get that dude.

02:53.135 --> 02:54.135
He grows on you.

02:54.136 --> 02:55.136
That's right.

02:55.137 --> 02:56.504
You always did like a challenge.

02:56.505 --> 02:58.206
Kept you on your toes at Quantico.

02:58.207 --> 02:59.441
What's up?

02:59.442 --> 03:01.109
I got to head to DC for a couple of days,

03:01.110 --> 03:04.012
check in with the Deputy Director's Office.

03:04.013 --> 03:05.246
Anything serious?

03:05.247 --> 03:06.314
Shouldn't be.

03:06.315 --> 03:08.583
Just up against a deadline
on the Nevins case.

03:08.584 --> 03:10.518
Got to ask for an extension, so...

03:12.355 --> 03:13.922
Duty phone.

03:13.923 --> 03:15.668
How about you hold down the fort

03:15.669 --> 03:17.025
while I'm gone?

03:17.026 --> 03:19.294
Really?

03:21.263 --> 03:23.431
You sure you don't want to
give that to somebody else?

03:23.432 --> 03:25.366
You've earned it.

03:28.437 --> 03:30.095
Hmm.

03:30.265 --> 03:32.540
I'll do what I can to deserve this.

03:32.541 --> 03:34.209
Thank you, sir.

03:34.210 --> 03:36.544
Mm-hmm.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.665 --> 03:59.033
You know I spent 96 hours

03:59.034 --> 04:01.336
casing a warehouse in Dubai to get this?

04:01.337 --> 04:04.339
This is about the Shard
of Anubis, isn't it?

04:04.340 --> 04:06.274
We know Mills and Corbin have it.

04:06.275 --> 04:07.609
Just let me go get it.

04:07.610 --> 04:09.210
Oh, you had your chance.

04:09.211 --> 04:10.378
Really?

04:10.379 --> 04:11.880
You're gonna play it that way?

04:11.881 --> 04:13.314
So they were a little tougher

04:13.315 --> 04:14.215
than we thought.

04:14.216 --> 04:16.084
I won't be so gentle this time.

04:16.084 --> 04:18.052
Okay? I can play rough.

04:18.053 --> 04:20.855
Honey, you don't know what rough is.

04:20.856 --> 04:22.590
The person who contracted me for this job

04:22.591 --> 04:24.025
is a demanding sort

04:24.026 --> 04:25.093
and if I don't have the Shard

04:25.094 --> 04:26.094
in the next 12 hours...

04:26.095 --> 04:27.095
Let me guess.

04:27.096 --> 04:28.830
There will be hell to pay.

04:28.831 --> 04:32.000
Oh, hell will be getting off easy.

04:36.272 --> 04:38.339
So, you're gonna recite

04:38.340 --> 04:41.075
Norse poetry to them?

04:41.076 --> 04:43.077
Granted,

04:43.078 --> 04:44.245
it'd be torture.

04:44.246 --> 04:45.647
Desperate times, Sophie.

04:47.383 --> 04:49.484
Desperate times.

05:37.666 --> 05:41.636
"And by Pandora with passion'd heart

05:41.637 --> 05:47.175
Art thou summoned and fashioned part."

05:53.883 --> 05:56.784
Oh, I'll be damned.

05:56.785 --> 05:58.887
"Of fire

05:58.888 --> 06:00.955
"and steel

06:00.956 --> 06:03.424
"and ire and rage

06:03.425 --> 06:06.661
"Berserkers flesh from off this page.

06:06.662 --> 06:09.330
"To carry forth thy Master's will

06:09.331 --> 06:11.633
"And follow through

06:11.634 --> 06:13.868
until the kill."

07:17.132 --> 07:19.667
That's it.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.576
Now, go. Go fetch.

07:42.591 --> 07:45.393
All I'm saying is if I was the one who knew

07:45.394 --> 07:48.596
about a Swiss bank
account in my dad's name,

07:48.597 --> 07:50.798
I would consider cashing it out.

07:50.799 --> 07:52.900
It's blood money, Jenny.
Nevins said as much.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.637
So give it to charity.

07:55.638 --> 07:56.871
Who knows what's

07:56.872 --> 07:58.272
actually in that account?

07:58.273 --> 08:01.209
Maybe your dad left a message.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.378
That's what all this has been about...

08:03.379 --> 08:05.046
figuring out

08:05.047 --> 08:07.882
the riddle wrapped in an enigma

08:07.883 --> 08:10.518
who was August Corbin.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.687
That's how it started.

08:12.688 --> 08:15.056
I thought maybe if you showed me the world

08:15.057 --> 08:17.191
you shared with my dad, I
might feel closer to him.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.363
And?

08:25.234 --> 08:28.636
Well, he's not the one I feel closer to.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.118
Aah!

08:44.119 --> 08:46.654
Oh, geez, Mills.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.690
I get the hint.

08:48.691 --> 08:51.626
Jenny?

08:56.098 --> 08:58.232
Hey, Jenny?

08:59.535 --> 09:01.702
Jenny!

09:07.443 --> 09:09.010
Hey!

09:09.011 --> 09:10.645
Jenny!

09:10.646 --> 09:13.047
Jenny...

09:20.923 --> 09:22.490
And this never happened before?

09:22.491 --> 09:24.459
No, I had some weird
dreams the other night.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.493
Could be related.

09:25.494 --> 09:27.528
No physical changes?

09:27.529 --> 09:29.497
I think I would remember
developing mutant powers.

09:29.498 --> 09:31.766
Look, it's-it's got to be the Shard.

09:31.767 --> 09:34.035
Her veins were glowing the
same color as the Shard.

09:34.036 --> 09:35.265
I thought

09:35.266 --> 09:37.038
the Shard of Anubis was a metallic lump.

09:37.039 --> 09:38.339
Oh, it turns out

09:38.340 --> 09:40.274
that was just an outer casing of some kind.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.375
When Nevins opened it...

09:41.376 --> 09:42.810
Nevins? Wait a minute!

09:42.811 --> 09:43.978
You guys went and saw Nevins

09:43.979 --> 09:45.413
after I told you to steer clear?

09:45.414 --> 09:46.647
That was my call.

09:46.648 --> 09:47.715
Which I backed.

09:47.716 --> 09:49.016
I told you Nevins is the target

09:49.017 --> 09:51.185
of an active FBI investigation...

09:51.186 --> 09:52.754
Which is why we got in and got out.

09:52.755 --> 09:54.021
No harm, no foul.

09:54.022 --> 09:55.223
"No harm."

09:55.224 --> 09:56.838
You could've compromised
everything that we've...

09:56.839 --> 09:58.192
- If I may.
- Mm.

09:58.193 --> 10:00.695
What was inside the case

10:00.696 --> 10:02.196
after Nevins opened it?

10:02.197 --> 10:05.767
It was a glowing crystal.

10:05.768 --> 10:08.102
And when I took it from
him, it disintegrated.

10:11.774 --> 10:13.207
Did you touch the crystal?

10:13.208 --> 10:14.776
No, just the outer casing.

10:14.777 --> 10:16.043
And Nevins, did he handle it?

10:16.044 --> 10:19.080
Yeah, he-he picked it up.

10:19.081 --> 10:21.082
But he put on a glove.

10:27.289 --> 10:29.056
What you got?

10:29.057 --> 10:30.792
Binding stones.

10:30.793 --> 10:32.460
Very rare, very powerful artifact

10:32.461 --> 10:34.495
with a singular quality...

10:34.496 --> 10:37.598
they are absorbed into
the body upon contact.

10:37.599 --> 10:41.269
It is a way to directly
transfer mystical energy.

10:41.270 --> 10:43.805
You're saying I absorbed the Shard?

10:43.806 --> 10:45.807
That it's inside of me?

10:45.808 --> 10:47.475
So it would seem.

10:47.476 --> 10:49.777
Miss Jenny,

10:49.778 --> 10:53.014
mortal beings are not meant to
house this much mystical energy.

10:53.015 --> 10:54.549
It is akin to...

10:54.550 --> 10:56.050
...plugging a high-voltage wire

10:56.051 --> 10:57.451
into child's toy.

10:57.452 --> 10:58.686
It'll fry the circuits.

10:58.687 --> 11:00.988
The Shard...

11:00.989 --> 11:02.690
it's gonna kill me.

11:30.557 --> 11:34.292
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

11:46.567 --> 11:49.235
So, we find a way to
get it out of her, right?

11:49.236 --> 11:52.004
There's got to be some kind of spell or...

11:52.005 --> 11:53.648
Shard-ectomy we can perform.

11:53.649 --> 11:55.665
Very little is known about binding stones.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.227
It's been centuries since anyone

11:57.228 --> 11:58.395
even recorded seeing one.

11:58.396 --> 11:59.629
For what it's worth,

11:59.630 --> 12:01.064
I feel fine.

12:01.065 --> 12:02.832
I feel awesome, actually.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.300
Yeah, well, that can just be temporary.

12:04.301 --> 12:06.069
You know, the way some terminal patients

12:06.070 --> 12:08.004
feel euphoric just
before they decompensate?

12:08.005 --> 12:10.507
Look, if anybody knows how
to deal with this thing,

12:10.508 --> 12:12.308
- it's Nevins.
- Nevins is off-limits.

12:12.309 --> 12:14.644
Whoa, okay, I know that this
might cause some problems

12:14.645 --> 12:16.513
with your job, but this is
Jenny we're talking about.

12:16.514 --> 12:18.281
You don't think that I know that?

12:18.282 --> 12:20.817
What good are you gonna be
to her if you're locked up?

12:20.818 --> 12:22.318
- Shh, quiet.
- Well, isn't that what you're

12:22.319 --> 12:23.787
supposed to be helping
us with, Agent Mills?

12:23.788 --> 12:25.188
Quiet!

12:26.524 --> 12:28.424
You hear that?

12:34.699 --> 12:36.166
We got company.

12:40.171 --> 12:42.806
Lieutenant!

13:17.041 --> 13:18.675
Jenny, we got to go!

13:31.922 --> 13:32.822
This way!

14:01.719 --> 14:04.721
Those things... they were unstoppable.

14:04.722 --> 14:07.190
Hitting them seemed to make them stronger.

14:07.191 --> 14:09.959
Like they fed off the
energy of our attacks.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.027
It's a miracle we're alive.

14:11.028 --> 14:13.029
No miracle... Jenny.

14:15.432 --> 14:18.034
I guess being fatally infected

14:18.035 --> 14:21.137
with the power of an ancient
artifact has its pluses.

14:21.138 --> 14:22.539
They just converged on you.

14:22.540 --> 14:23.640
They didn't care about us at all.

14:23.641 --> 14:26.943
Perhaps drawn to her energy.

14:26.944 --> 14:28.578
Like moths to a flame.

14:28.579 --> 14:30.046
Or they were sent for her.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.048
You said it, Crane.

14:32.049 --> 14:33.550
She is the Shard.

14:33.551 --> 14:35.051
Which Nevins is obsessed with.

14:35.052 --> 14:37.220
You think he might be
controlling these creatures?

14:37.221 --> 14:38.988
Nevins is bad news,

14:38.989 --> 14:42.091
but summoning demonic rage
creatures is way over his head.

14:43.027 --> 14:44.794
Not over Pandora's.

14:48.032 --> 14:50.033
These are precisely the kind of hellspawn

14:50.034 --> 14:51.000
she's been known to unleash.

14:51.001 --> 14:53.002
- We should've seen this before.
- Seen what?

14:53.003 --> 14:55.805
Nevins is working with Pandora.

14:59.143 --> 15:00.376
Oh, hey, Jenny.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.948
Sorry.

15:04.949 --> 15:06.349
Just a little woozy.

15:07.117 --> 15:08.885
Let's head to the archives.

15:20.097 --> 15:22.318
I've got some Web crawlers
that can scour Darknet sites.

15:22.319 --> 15:24.465
If someone out there's
talking about binding stones,

15:24.466 --> 15:25.309
that's where we'll find it.

15:25.310 --> 15:27.310
You're supposed to be resting.

15:27.311 --> 15:28.711
I'm fine.

15:28.712 --> 15:30.080
Besides, it's not the flu.

15:30.081 --> 15:33.049
I don't think rest and
fluids are gonna cut it.

15:34.385 --> 15:36.319
Our lives keep getting jumbled up in this.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.197
You know, I worked hard to separate

15:38.198 --> 15:40.523
my professional life from the supernatural,

15:40.524 --> 15:42.092
and look what happened.

15:42.093 --> 15:45.261
It literally infected my family.

15:45.262 --> 15:49.866
You always tried so hard to
compartmentalize your life,

15:49.867 --> 15:52.535
let's face it, because
you're a control freak,

15:52.536 --> 15:56.272
but this stuff we're
involved with is messy.

15:56.273 --> 15:59.042
The supernatural is the
only world I've ever known

15:59.043 --> 16:01.077
and if it ends up killing me,

16:01.078 --> 16:03.413
well, I can think of worse ways to go.

16:03.414 --> 16:06.216
You're not going anywhere.

16:06.217 --> 16:08.751
Says the control freak.

16:13.224 --> 16:14.924
Uh, apologies.

16:14.925 --> 16:17.594
It's all right, I get it.

16:17.595 --> 16:19.123
I'm... I'm just amazed

16:19.124 --> 16:20.570
how you guys focus in on this stuff

16:20.571 --> 16:22.305
when monsters are out there

16:22.306 --> 16:24.373
and people you care about are hurting.

16:28.045 --> 16:30.046
Indeed.

16:30.047 --> 16:31.881
There is nothing more frustrating

16:31.882 --> 16:34.884
than the feeling of helplessness
in the face of an unknown foe.

16:34.885 --> 16:38.888
Which is why we must seize control

16:38.889 --> 16:40.623
whilst we can.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.558
Hmm?

16:42.559 --> 16:44.594
Talk to her.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.534
Right.

16:51.535 --> 16:53.536
What about you?

16:53.537 --> 16:55.671
Get the feeling it's not just rage monsters

16:55.672 --> 16:58.074
that have you feeling helpless.

16:58.075 --> 16:59.976
Uh...

16:59.977 --> 17:02.812
I have become well acquainted
with the vicissitudes of life.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.047
Oh, come on.

17:05.048 --> 17:07.450
But, yes.

17:07.451 --> 17:10.051
I have become keenly aware of late that...

17:10.053 --> 17:14.457
I may be fighting a losing
battle... on many fronts.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.459
Against bureaucrats.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.460
Against developers.

17:17.461 --> 17:19.795
Against...

17:19.796 --> 17:21.597
On many fronts.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.699
Well, maybe you should
take your own advice.

17:26.136 --> 17:28.237
Talk to her.

17:30.107 --> 17:33.376
Sometimes I just miss being
in the Corps, you know?

17:33.377 --> 17:35.240
You had your mission, had your orders,

17:35.241 --> 17:36.392
that was all you needed to know.

17:36.393 --> 17:37.593
Oh, yes.

17:37.594 --> 17:39.962
There is a purity

17:39.963 --> 17:42.365
to the mission of a workaday soldier.

17:42.366 --> 17:46.969
One which, I confess, I miss as well.

17:46.970 --> 17:49.772
If only we could be so
single-minded all the time.

17:49.773 --> 17:50.773
Hmm.

17:50.774 --> 17:52.875
Single-minded mission.

17:58.415 --> 17:59.882
You got something, Crane?

18:00.784 --> 18:02.885
Uh...

18:04.188 --> 18:06.189
Here.

18:06.190 --> 18:08.925
"Once summoned and scented with a quarry,

18:08.926 --> 18:11.928
"they will continue
their pursuit indefinitely

18:11.929 --> 18:14.730
"until the quarry has been captured.

18:14.731 --> 18:17.733
"It is this single-minded
focus on their mission

18:17.734 --> 18:20.136
"that defines the fearsome
creatures known as...

18:20.137 --> 18:22.872
the Norse berserkers."

18:22.873 --> 18:24.307
Berserkers.

18:24.308 --> 18:26.279
That would explain their
anger-management issues.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.110
Do they have any weaknesses?

18:28.111 --> 18:29.779
Uh, it says their strength burgeons

18:29.780 --> 18:31.345
the more you fight them,

18:31.346 --> 18:33.349
as they feed off the energy of the battle.

18:33.350 --> 18:35.351
They are vulnerable to one substance...

18:35.352 --> 18:37.587
mistletoe.

18:37.588 --> 18:39.589
Wait, seriously?

18:39.590 --> 18:41.858
Like, as in, "Gosh, who put that there?

18:41.859 --> 18:43.926
Oh, well, I guess we
should kiss" mistletoe?

18:45.829 --> 18:47.864
Mis...

18:47.865 --> 18:49.866
Mistletoe is known to have druidic powers.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.741
In fact, Celtic priests
would coat their arrows

18:52.742 --> 18:55.023
- in mistletoe sap before going to battle.
- Wait a minute.

18:55.024 --> 18:56.526
Jenny actually showed
me some crossbow bolts

18:56.527 --> 18:58.588
- that looked like that.
- Hey, Mills, where'd...?

19:07.105 --> 19:09.439
Behold my glory

19:09.440 --> 19:11.942
for I am coming.

19:23.776 --> 19:25.510
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:25.511 --> 19:30.038
The bakery accidentally
put peanuts in the cake,

19:30.039 --> 19:32.607
and two fights have broken
out over who's better...

19:32.608 --> 19:34.542
Katy Perry or Taylor Swift.

19:35.645 --> 19:36.845
So...

19:36.846 --> 19:39.681
the Nevins case.

19:39.682 --> 19:40.849
Shouldn't this be wrapped up by now?

19:40.850 --> 19:42.484
Very close, sir.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.619
Surveillance has yielded a ton of leads.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.139
But you still don't have your smoking gun.

19:46.140 --> 19:46.822
No, sir.

19:46.823 --> 19:49.991
Nevins has been cagier than expected.

19:49.992 --> 19:51.092
I just need a little more time.

19:51.093 --> 19:52.427
With a few more resources...

19:52.428 --> 19:53.795
I can't divert any more assets

19:53.796 --> 19:55.372
without attracting more attention.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.301
How much more time do you need?

19:59.302 --> 20:02.003
One... two weeks at the most.

20:02.004 --> 20:04.706
Just make sure this goes
down clean and by the book.

20:04.707 --> 20:06.041
You got eyes on this one.

20:06.042 --> 20:07.142
Yes, sir.

20:09.245 --> 20:11.246
And by the way, uh, how's our agent doing?

20:11.247 --> 20:13.348
The, uh, diamond in the rough?

20:13.349 --> 20:16.017
I have no doubt she'll be one
of the very best in the Bureau.

20:16.018 --> 20:18.987
Good to hear, 'cause there
are eyes on her as well.

20:33.936 --> 20:35.704
How long was I out?

20:35.705 --> 20:37.906
Not long.

20:37.907 --> 20:39.908
You started glowing like a road flare,

20:39.909 --> 20:41.810
and then you zonked out.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.547
How you feeling?

20:47.049 --> 20:49.060
Like I went a couple rounds with Godzilla.

20:49.061 --> 20:50.060
Mm.

20:50.061 --> 20:53.430
Or Godzilla's meaner brother.

20:53.431 --> 20:55.599
You remember anything?

20:57.402 --> 20:58.835
Not really.

20:58.836 --> 21:01.738
Just a feeling, like...

21:01.739 --> 21:05.308
like I was someone powerful.

21:10.415 --> 21:12.416
Masonic cell.

21:12.417 --> 21:15.051
Its mystical protections will keep you

21:15.052 --> 21:16.486
off the berserkers' radar.

21:16.487 --> 21:17.487
Mm.

21:17.488 --> 21:19.489
Where are the guys?

21:19.490 --> 21:21.591
Crane has a theory on how
to track the berserkers,

21:21.592 --> 21:24.461
and he and Joe are checking it out.

21:24.462 --> 21:26.663
- They're gonna need our help.
- Mm, okay.

21:28.599 --> 21:30.433
We're just gonna chill, okay?

21:32.270 --> 21:34.104
They'll let us know if they need us.

21:36.674 --> 21:39.743
And they're armed up with the
mistletoe bolts anyway, so...

21:39.744 --> 21:42.679
You pulled babysitter duty?

21:42.680 --> 21:44.314
Just like old times.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.517
Yep.

21:47.518 --> 21:48.618
All right.

22:02.433 --> 22:04.601
Just like old times.

22:14.645 --> 22:16.646
You really think they're here?

22:16.647 --> 22:19.082
If Norse legends are anything to go by,

22:19.083 --> 22:22.853
the berserkers will seek out a metal cave,

22:22.854 --> 22:25.489
similar to the mines of Nidavellir.

22:25.490 --> 22:28.492
To rejuvenate and recalibrate
their tracking senses.

22:28.493 --> 22:32.195
Well... this is the closest
thing Sleepy Hollow's got

22:32.196 --> 22:33.563
to a dark metal cave.

22:33.564 --> 22:34.798
Let's go.

23:25.650 --> 23:28.184
They're here.

23:41.132 --> 23:42.766
Crane, behind you!

24:12.730 --> 24:15.098
What do we do now?

24:18.536 --> 24:20.870
Run.

24:36.654 --> 24:38.188
Won't hold 'em for long!

24:39.590 --> 24:41.758
Get to the truck! Now!

24:56.145 --> 24:57.679
Could the text have been wrong?

24:57.681 --> 25:00.492
Perhaps. The anecdotal
evidence is overwhelming.

25:00.493 --> 25:01.826
Why didn't the mistletoe work?

25:01.827 --> 25:04.310
There may have been a modification

25:04.311 --> 25:06.446
to the ritual used to summon them.

25:06.447 --> 25:07.847
The only way to know for certain

25:07.848 --> 25:09.916
is to examine Nevins' source material.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.818
We need to know what spell he used.

25:11.819 --> 25:12.652
No.

25:12.653 --> 25:14.338
It would take me no more than a few minutes

25:14.339 --> 25:16.689
- to search Nevins' office.
- Crane.

25:16.690 --> 25:18.691
Nevins' place is being surveilled 24-7.

25:18.692 --> 25:20.660
And as it is, Joe and Jenny

25:20.661 --> 25:23.830
may end up before a grand
jury once Nevins is indicted.

25:23.831 --> 25:25.131
Not to mention,

25:25.132 --> 25:27.133
if we keep sticking our nose in,

25:27.134 --> 25:29.102
we'll blow this whole case for Danny.

25:29.103 --> 25:33.840
Lieutenant, you know
I understand your bind,

25:33.841 --> 25:36.142
and I, more than anyone, know what it means

25:36.143 --> 25:39.579
to be pulled between two worlds,

25:39.580 --> 25:41.914
but if we do not stop these monsters...

25:41.915 --> 25:43.983
we cannot risk moving Miss Jenny anywhere,

25:43.984 --> 25:45.685
even to a hospital.

25:45.686 --> 25:49.389
These creatures will not
stop until we stop them.

25:49.390 --> 25:53.526
But, please, if you know of
any other course of action...

26:04.171 --> 26:06.272
Remember how to use this?

26:11.712 --> 26:15.148
Make sure the door is
not wired for any alarms.

26:15.149 --> 26:18.084
Have Joe show you the layout of the place.

26:18.085 --> 26:20.920
And get out of there as fast as you can.

26:20.921 --> 26:22.121
Go.

26:53.087 --> 26:55.021
I've arrived.

26:55.022 --> 26:57.724
No sign of Nevins' automobile.

26:57.725 --> 26:59.425
Got it. Sit tight.

26:59.426 --> 27:01.194
Understood.

27:10.738 --> 27:13.539
Ramirez.

27:13.540 --> 27:14.540
This is Mills.

27:14.541 --> 27:16.008
I need you to check out a 10-37

27:16.009 --> 27:17.577
at the Harbor Island shipyards.

27:17.578 --> 27:18.978
Seriously?

27:18.979 --> 27:20.880
Why does port authority seem to think

27:20.881 --> 27:22.248
every vehicle is suspicious?

27:22.249 --> 27:24.250
I know, it's probably nothing,

27:24.251 --> 27:25.963
but Homeland sent down a memo

27:26.203 --> 27:28.197
about activity down on the port.

27:28.198 --> 27:31.223
Does Reynolds know about this?
We're not supposed to leave our post.

27:31.224 --> 27:33.762
He's in D.C. I'm on the desk.

27:33.806 --> 27:34.686
Copy that.

27:36.845 --> 27:38.012
Come on lets go.

29:17.064 --> 29:18.498
Hold still!

29:18.499 --> 29:19.899
No sudden moves.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.133
Unhand me, you scoundrel.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.903
Funny words, coming from a potential thief.

29:29.510 --> 29:30.910
Do I look like a common thief,

29:30.911 --> 29:33.779
stealing worms?

29:33.780 --> 29:35.047
No.

29:36.783 --> 29:39.518
You look like the bass player
for some British rock band.

29:40.754 --> 29:42.955
- What are you doing here?
- At a bait shop?

29:42.956 --> 29:44.090
I'm looking for bait.

29:44.091 --> 29:45.191
- You're a fisherman?
- Yes.

29:45.192 --> 29:46.926
Monofilament line or fused?

29:46.927 --> 29:48.094
Braided horsehair.

29:48.095 --> 29:50.763
Baited with worm, minnow or little frog,

29:50.764 --> 29:53.933
just as Izaak Walton prescribed.

29:53.934 --> 29:54.967
Hmm.

29:54.968 --> 29:58.237
Bait is in this building.

29:58.238 --> 30:01.040
Ah, thank you.

30:01.041 --> 30:02.775
I might ask what you're doing here,

30:02.776 --> 30:05.845
slamming patrons up against a wall.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.480
My friend owns this place.

30:07.481 --> 30:09.148
He doesn't like strange people

30:09.149 --> 30:10.583
lurking around the alleyways.

30:10.584 --> 30:12.251
Did you call me "strange"? Oh, good grief,

30:12.252 --> 30:14.186
- how will I ever endure?
- Save it.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.823
You don't strike me as
the thin-skinned type.

30:17.824 --> 30:20.660
Word to the wise, Dr. Strange.

30:20.661 --> 30:22.495
Steer clear.

30:22.496 --> 30:23.963
If we run into each other again,

30:23.964 --> 30:25.598
next time it won't be so pleasant.

30:25.599 --> 30:28.267
Your pleasantries need
a little work, madam.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.013
How'd it go?

30:41.014 --> 30:43.549
- Nothing that could not be managed.
- Complications?

30:43.550 --> 30:47.086
A brief run-in with one
of Nevins' associates.

30:47.087 --> 30:49.488
She was... pugnacious.

30:49.489 --> 30:50.990
Nothing to worry about.

30:50.991 --> 30:52.158
Ah.

30:52.159 --> 30:54.360
Nevins' important belongings

30:54.361 --> 30:56.195
were locked away,

30:56.196 --> 30:58.264
but I managed to retrieve this.

30:59.633 --> 31:01.033
The spell Nevins cast

31:01.034 --> 31:03.002
was from the Ynglinga saga,

31:03.003 --> 31:04.103
but he changed something.

31:04.104 --> 31:06.005
Whereas the Norse mystics

31:06.006 --> 31:07.873
called upon the power of Odin,

31:07.874 --> 31:10.309
Nevins invoked the power of Pandora.

31:10.310 --> 31:11.877
Presumably, the mystical source

31:11.878 --> 31:13.312
he was tapping was Pandora's box.

31:13.313 --> 31:14.680
It is slight

31:14.681 --> 31:17.049
but a significant alteration.

31:17.050 --> 31:19.051
And that's why the mistletoe didn't work.

31:19.052 --> 31:21.420
We have no way of figuring
out their weakness.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.856
We're fighting an unbeatable enemy.

31:23.857 --> 31:26.859
"When faced with an unbeatable enemy,

31:26.860 --> 31:29.762
you must make the enemy beat themselves."

31:29.763 --> 31:30.930
More Sun Tzu?

31:30.931 --> 31:32.164
No.

31:32.165 --> 31:34.934
A thinker of a more Western ilk.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.569
Daniel Boone.

31:36.570 --> 31:38.938
Summer, 1779.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.107
Boonesborough, Kentucky,
was facing an imminent attack

31:41.108 --> 31:43.075
from British and Hessian forces.

31:43.076 --> 31:46.278
Each army was overwhelming
in its own right,

31:46.279 --> 31:48.414
but combined, they were unbeatable.

31:48.415 --> 31:50.950
Boone knew his ragtag militia had no chance

31:50.951 --> 31:53.052
against the joint forces.

31:53.053 --> 31:54.887
He also knew the British-Hessian alliance

31:54.888 --> 31:57.089
was an uneasy one at best.

32:17.678 --> 32:19.045
He feigned a British attack

32:19.046 --> 32:21.147
on the Hessian encampment,

32:21.148 --> 32:22.982
then did the same in the British camp.

32:22.983 --> 32:24.817
Of course, before long,
the British and the Hessians

32:24.818 --> 32:28.120
turned on one another
and wiped themselves out.

32:28.121 --> 32:29.955
Boonesborough was saved.

32:29.956 --> 32:31.957
Make the enemy defeat themselves.

32:31.958 --> 32:33.159
Exactly.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.427
It just might work.

32:34.428 --> 32:36.962
We need Joe's help on this one.

32:36.963 --> 32:39.165
He's back in the Masonic cell with Jenny.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.133
I'll find the supplies we need.

32:41.134 --> 32:43.636
Lieutenant, do realize
if we do not succeed,

32:43.637 --> 32:45.971
then to all intents and
purposes, this shall be...

32:45.972 --> 32:48.040
Checkmate.

32:50.410 --> 32:53.546
So tell me again how this
plan is supposed to work.

32:53.547 --> 32:57.983
Well, it is an Abbie-Crane special.

32:57.984 --> 32:59.819
One part history,

32:59.820 --> 33:02.288
one part magic,

33:02.289 --> 33:03.956
whole lotta crazy.

33:07.094 --> 33:09.495
- Mm.
- Sorry, is this hurting you?

33:09.496 --> 33:10.930
Mm, no.

33:10.931 --> 33:12.732
No, I'm just a little dizzy.

33:14.634 --> 33:18.938
You know, I spent my whole
life hunting magical artifacts.

33:18.939 --> 33:21.140
Now one of those
artifacts is fighting back.

33:22.943 --> 33:25.344
Is that karmic or ironic?

33:25.345 --> 33:27.046
It's neither.

33:27.047 --> 33:30.216
It's gonna be a little footnote

33:30.217 --> 33:31.617
when you tell people the story

33:31.618 --> 33:33.185
about what happened here years from now.

33:33.186 --> 33:37.056
Oh, yeah? Who am I gonna tell?

33:37.057 --> 33:38.824
Well, let's see, I don't know.

33:38.825 --> 33:40.226
I mean...

33:40.227 --> 33:41.861
Abbie'll be running the FBI,

33:41.862 --> 33:43.295
so she's gonna be kind of tough to reach.

33:43.296 --> 33:45.495
And Crane will be

33:45.496 --> 33:47.299
a college professor, but he's only gonna

33:47.300 --> 33:49.201
keep office hours, like, once a week,

33:49.202 --> 33:50.669
so...

33:50.670 --> 33:53.272
What does he teach?

33:54.741 --> 33:56.075
Modern cinema.

34:00.046 --> 34:01.147
Hmm.

34:01.148 --> 34:03.816
So I guess that leaves me.

34:05.619 --> 34:07.720
I guess it does.

34:12.058 --> 34:14.260
You know, Crane told
me I should talk to you.

34:15.629 --> 34:17.362
About what?

34:17.364 --> 34:19.665
About this.

34:46.967 --> 34:47.967
Hey.

34:49.036 --> 34:50.538
Make sure the carabiner's locked

34:50.539 --> 34:51.539
and the tether's tight.

34:51.540 --> 34:54.507
You talk as if I've never
climbed a mountain before.

34:56.411 --> 34:57.511
Right.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.513
I've never climbed a mountain before.

35:00.916 --> 35:02.917
Here, like this.

35:39.521 --> 35:40.788
Ready?

35:49.297 --> 35:51.532
Well, it shouldn't be long now.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.504
Good God.

37:04.706 --> 37:06.640
Like hyenas.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.643
Hyenas from hell.

37:30.432 --> 37:32.533
Give my regards to Pandora.

37:46.715 --> 37:49.783
So much for unbeatable enemy.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.224
I gotta give it to your pal Daniel Boone.

37:57.225 --> 37:59.393
Turning the enemies against themselves...

37:59.394 --> 38:00.345
so sharp.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.897
Well, despite his rough-hewn persona,

38:02.898 --> 38:05.032
Boone was as cunning a
tactician as any general.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.534
Mm-hmm!

38:06.535 --> 38:08.536
And I gotta give props to you, too, Crane,

38:08.537 --> 38:09.603
'cause you put it all together.

38:09.604 --> 38:10.738
No, no, no!

38:10.739 --> 38:12.439
Props to you, Lieutenant.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.675
It was your idea more than mine.

38:14.676 --> 38:16.410
"Nothing beats a good blindside."

38:16.411 --> 38:18.445
Yeah.

38:18.446 --> 38:20.548
Also, you noted

38:20.549 --> 38:24.084
that I've been off my game of late.

38:24.085 --> 38:27.822
When I pledged my allegiance
to this country in 1776,

38:27.823 --> 38:30.825
I had a very clear vision
of what my future would hold.

38:30.826 --> 38:31.917
Nowhere in that vision

38:31.918 --> 38:34.219
did I imagine waking in the 21st century,

38:34.220 --> 38:36.322
and yet...

38:36.323 --> 38:38.390
More and more,

38:38.391 --> 38:41.293
I feel this desire to acculturate.

38:41.294 --> 38:45.297
But the idea of losing the archives,

38:45.298 --> 38:47.132
of losing my fight for citizenship

38:47.133 --> 38:49.668
for a country that I, in part, founded,

38:49.669 --> 38:51.069
the idea of losing you...

38:52.939 --> 38:56.642
...to some wretched federal promotion to...

38:56.643 --> 38:59.311
I don't know, Dallas
or to Los Angeles or...

39:00.880 --> 39:04.983
Sometimes, it seems as
though the unbeatable enemy

39:04.984 --> 39:07.486
is the 21st century.

39:09.289 --> 39:13.325
Yeah, but the thing is, Crane...

39:13.326 --> 39:15.227
Joe, me, Jenny...

39:15.228 --> 39:17.329
we are the 21st century.

39:17.330 --> 39:18.964
And every day, we take you

39:18.965 --> 39:20.966
a step further in that direction.

39:20.967 --> 39:24.336
That is the unbeatable
enemy beating itself.

39:26.339 --> 39:28.207
And we ain't goin' nowhere.

39:30.210 --> 39:32.045
Aw, that was beautiful.

39:33.313 --> 39:35.950
I can see you guys are going
through something personal

39:35.951 --> 39:37.669
and I hate to step on such a lovely moment,

39:37.670 --> 39:39.738
but I got some pressing issues of my own.

39:39.739 --> 39:41.473
Like where is Jenny Mills?

39:54.610 --> 39:55.510
I told you it wouldn't

39:55.511 --> 39:57.445
work out so well for you, if we met again.

39:57.446 --> 39:59.747
- Hmm. - Tell me where Jenny
Mills is, or I start shooting.

39:59.748 --> 40:00.492
What do you want from her?

40:00.493 --> 40:03.184
I don't want anything from her, I want her.

40:03.185 --> 40:04.752
See, the energy from the Shard

40:04.753 --> 40:06.521
is very important to someone I work for,

40:06.522 --> 40:09.056
and it's vital I get it back.

40:09.057 --> 40:11.225
- Pandora.
- No.

40:11.226 --> 40:13.928
Someone who makes Pandora
look like a homeroom teacher.

40:13.929 --> 40:16.197
And he will be here soon,

40:16.198 --> 40:18.566
so give me Jenny Mills!

40:18.567 --> 40:20.167
You've got five seconds.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.503
I'm sorry, kid, this is nothing personal.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.405
Ah, screw you.

40:24.406 --> 40:25.773
You are definitely

40:25.774 --> 40:27.208
August Corbin's son.

40:27.209 --> 40:28.543
- Five!
- Wait, now. Hold on.

40:28.544 --> 40:29.844
- Four.
- Don't tell 'em anything, Abbie.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.046
- No, no, no...
- Three. Two.

40:32.047 --> 40:34.115
Drop the gun, Atticus!

40:34.116 --> 40:36.617
Sophie Foster, FBI!

40:36.618 --> 40:38.152
Now drop the gun.

40:39.221 --> 40:41.055
You traitorous bitch...

40:46.495 --> 40:49.597
Six months on this mission,

40:49.598 --> 40:51.065
and I blow my cover now.

40:51.066 --> 40:52.433
Reynolds is gonna lose it.

40:52.434 --> 40:54.035
Reynolds knows about you?

40:54.036 --> 40:56.003
Knows? This is his op.

40:56.004 --> 40:57.838
My role in this investigation

40:57.839 --> 40:59.699
was strictly need-to-know.
Only inner circle.

41:01.009 --> 41:03.210
He didn't tell you.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.392
All right, I'm taking him
in. See what we can salvage.

41:05.393 --> 41:07.615
Listen, you better find your sister.

41:07.616 --> 41:09.459
Nevins sent the who's
who of bad guys after her,

41:09.460 --> 41:11.652
and there's no telling who's
still out there. All right?

41:11.653 --> 41:13.220
Let's go.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.394
Come on.

41:25.334 --> 41:26.600
Jenny?

41:28.103 --> 41:29.570
She's not here.

41:30.642 --> 41:31.746
It's crazy.

41:31.747 --> 41:33.181
I locked her in before I left.

41:33.182 --> 41:34.184
This lock

41:34.185 --> 41:36.351
has been broken from the inside.

41:36.352 --> 41:37.819
Crane.

41:42.659 --> 41:45.190
These drawings... they match Miss Jenny's

41:45.191 --> 41:46.425
description of her vision.

41:46.426 --> 41:47.993
What do they mean?

41:47.994 --> 41:49.495
I cannot say.

41:49.496 --> 41:52.397
But clearly, her condition is worsening.

41:53.700 --> 41:54.967
Guys, where is she?

42:48.421 --> 42:50.322
Kneel.

42:59.322 --> 43:02.702
Behold my glory.

43:03.284 --> 43:06.327
I have arrived.
