Nolan rescued me once,

You know how I know that?

12:55.437 --> 12:56.770
I don't really care.

12:56.805 --> 12:58.355
I know that
because of faith.

12:58.390 --> 12:59.973
Faith is a very important
quality

13:00.025 --> 13:01.975
for a long-term prisoner.

13:02.027 --> 13:04.194
Faith gets you
through the rough patches,

far, far away.

We don't know what
Kindzi's telling them.

13:57.249 --> 13:58.498

one by one.

your voice down.

14:37.622 --> 14:39.322
