WEBVTT

00:18.880 --> 00:23.440
So they wanna get a sound level.
Could you say something?

00:24.200 --> 00:26.120
Translate, boy. What did she say?

00:26.680 --> 00:29.280
Sorry?
I wanna get a sound level.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.520
Could you
say something into the microphone?

00:35.480 --> 00:38.160
One, two, three...

00:40.680 --> 00:43.000
Is that where you're gonna sit?

00:43.200 --> 00:44.880
Unless you'd like me to move.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.600
That's a good place.
As long as that's it, that's fine.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.960
Okay, we're set.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.520
What if recent United States efforts

00:56.720 --> 00:59.880
to help the Latin American people
are successful?

01:00.080 --> 01:04.160
If the ruling classes agreed
to land reforms and tax reforms,

01:04.360 --> 01:06.320
if the standard of living could be raised,

01:06.480 --> 01:11.560
wouldn't the message
of the Cuban revolution lose its power?

02:17.720 --> 02:21.960
Do what you want,
but don't mess with the Americans.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.160
It's pretty simple.
All we have to do

02:26.320 --> 02:28.640
is organize a coup.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.600
What did Batista do?
He led a coup and took power in one day.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.080
The main issue is to control power.
The rest is nonsense.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.480
It's not about taking power,
but knowing what to do with it.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.520
- That's right.
- That coup must be based on principles.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.520
Let's eat. Fidel is late.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.520
Argentine!
Could you give me a hand?

02:54.480 --> 02:58.720
It's not about making concessions
but establishing conditions.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.920
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's about time!

03:16.240 --> 03:19.360
Good evening. Sorry I'm late.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.600
This is Ernesto.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.640
- The Argentine doctor.
- Pleased to meet you.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.360
- My pleasure.
- Let's eat!

03:32.720 --> 03:36.680
Twenty percent of all Cubans
are permanently unemployed.

03:37.320 --> 03:43.560
One-point-five percent of the landowners
control 46 percent of the land.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.880
Half the population has no electricity.
Over half live in bohios.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.280
Sorry, what's a bohio?

03:54.920 --> 03:56.720
What's a bohio in Argentina?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.840
A shack.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.080
Thirty-seven percent can't read or write.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.920
Infant mortality is through the roof.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.720
What's more,

04:08.160 --> 04:11.680
while the thugs of the dictatorship

04:11.880 --> 04:14.600
gun down anyone who speaks out,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.600
most corrupt officials

04:17.760 --> 04:20.920
steal hundreds of millions of dollars
from the public treasury

04:21.120 --> 04:24.360
and deposit it into
U.S. and European banks.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.200
It's the same
in all Latin American countries.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.440
In the last few years,

04:29.600 --> 04:32.680
the balance of payments
between the U.S. and Cuba

04:32.840 --> 04:38.200
has been favorable to the U.S.
by 1 billion dollars.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.000
What does this mean?

04:40.200 --> 04:42.760
That this poor Caribbean island

04:42.920 --> 04:46.880
is helping to support the economy of
the most developed country in the world.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.920
As Marti used to say,
if the U.S. takes Spain out of Cuba,

04:52.120 --> 04:54.560
then we would have to take out the U.S.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.640
Do you have a boat?

05:01.120 --> 05:02.480
Money?

05:03.840 --> 05:05.120
Not yet.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.000
Fighters?

05:08.800 --> 05:12.760
We've smuggled 30 into Mexico.
We'll get some more.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.720
Do you think I'm crazy?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.120
A little.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.800
Well,

05:27.080 --> 05:29.080
some craziness is good.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.120
Fidel have extraordinary faith

05:47.280 --> 05:49.800
that once we left for Cuba,

05:50.120 --> 05:51.720
we would make it there,

05:51.880 --> 05:55.600
and that once we made it to Cuba,
we would fight.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.080
And that in fighting, we would win.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.240
And so it was
that in November of '56,

06:01.400 --> 06:04.520
we left Mexico in a...

06:04.840 --> 06:08.720
A leaky boat, with 82 men onboard.

06:08.880 --> 06:14.320
And of those 82, only 12 would survive
to witness our victory.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.560
Murderer! Assassin!

06:56.080 --> 06:59.640
Get out of Cuba, Che! Murderer!

07:00.960 --> 07:03.480
Among Fidel Castro's top lieutenants,

07:03.680 --> 07:08.040
one of the most powerful
is Major Ernesto "Che " Guevara,

07:08.200 --> 07:11.680
the Argentine revolutionary
who became a Cuban citizen

07:11.840 --> 07:15.920
and, as Minister of Industries,
now presides over the Cuban economy.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.280
Major Guevara is a Marxist,
a soldier, a physician,

07:20.440 --> 07:23.800
and the author of the classic
handbook on guerilla warfare.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.960
He is 36 years old.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.400
He has been called the brains
of the revolution

07:28.600 --> 07:33.040
and the power behind Fidel Castro,
though he denies both assertions.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.840
From this point forward,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.640
we experienced 10 bitter days.

08:21.800 --> 08:26.160
The only way I could walk
was to hold myself up with the trees,

08:26.320 --> 08:30.120
or by leaning on the butt of my rifle.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.360
As if that were not enough,
I was traveling with a soldier

08:34.520 --> 08:38.480
who panicked every time
my asthma made me cough.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.120
Soldiers! Soldiers
are coming! There's a lot of them!

08:49.320 --> 08:52.080
They're going to kill us!
We have to hide!

09:13.480 --> 09:15.320
That's Epifanio's house!

09:48.480 --> 09:50.520
Close the door.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.520
Where's Fidel?

10:17.720 --> 10:20.600
My name is Ernesto Guevara.
What's yours?

10:20.760 --> 10:23.240
Jorge Sotús, why?

10:23.400 --> 10:26.080
I have orders from Fidel
to command you and your men,

10:27.680 --> 10:29.440
and lead you to where he is.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.120
Where are you from?

10:32.360 --> 10:33.760
Argentina.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.760
I don't trust anyone.
I'm the only one leading these troops.

10:40.200 --> 10:46.160
Frank Pais said to deliver these men
to Fidel, personally.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.240
Listen! We'll stop for five minutes.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.600
Sit down, everyone.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.800
Hey, what's going on?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.800
- Fidel is coming!
- Go and tell the doctor.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.240
- Stand up, come on!
- Fidel is coming.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.080
Stand up.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.760
Come on, up! Grab your rifle.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.280
Finally!

11:31.480 --> 11:34.920
Good to see you. Are you all right?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.600
This is Epifanio.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.800
- Raúl.
- How are you?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.920
Very good.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.960
Camilo.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.360
- How was your vacation?
- Vacation? What vacation?

11:51.640 --> 11:53.040
Almeida.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.040
Hello, Ramiro.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.240
- Hi, Vilma.
- Good to see you.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.760
Vilo.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.080
Hello, Celia.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.080
Thanks.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.280
Listen.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.800
Fidel wants to talk to you
about what happened with Sotús.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.280
Let him speak.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.440
If you say something,
it could sound defensive,

12:42.600 --> 12:44.400
and he's not going to like that.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.920
I left you in charge
of the reinforcements.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.040
I don't have anything
against Jorge Sotús,

12:55.200 --> 12:59.240
but how can you let someone with no
experience take charge of the troops?

13:01.640 --> 13:04.680
You still have this complex about
being foreign, and it's pointless.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.760
You trained with us,

13:06.920 --> 13:10.240
you came in the boat with us,
you were wounded fighting with us.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.880
You are as Cuban and revolutionary
as everyone here.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.440
We are forming three columns.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.360
Raúl will lead the first one.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.200
Almeida will be in charge
of the second one.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.920
And Jorge Sotús
will command the third one.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.720
I did all my studies,
finished high school,

14:06.880 --> 14:10.400
then I worked as a mechanic
for two or three years.

14:10.600 --> 14:15.520
I then delivered milk around the area.
Also worked as a boxer.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.520
And in a circus, working as a magician,
among other things.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.160
In a circus? How old are you?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.840
Twenty.

14:25.640 --> 14:29.160
Who gave them to you?
The one and only Celia Sánchez!

14:31.200 --> 14:34.200
He looks like John Wayne.

14:35.720 --> 14:39.000
- A cowboy from the Wild West.
- The Little Cowboy.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.960
That's it: "The Little Cowboy"!

14:42.120 --> 14:44.840
Little Cowboy! Little Cowboy!

15:06.040 --> 15:08.520
The army keeps moving up
and down the road, Fidel.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.080
It would be pretty easy
to hunt a couple of patrols.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.240
- We must be patient.
- I agree, it would be easy to do.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.960
- We could do it fast and safely.
- No, listen a second.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.880
If we attack one of the trucks,

15:20.720 --> 15:23.840
then the army would say
it was a crash on the road.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.760
But if we launch a full attack
on the Uvero barracks,

15:28.400 --> 15:32.440
it will be impossible
for them to deny our victory.

15:32.760 --> 15:38.120
It will have a huge psychological impact.
Do you understand?

15:52.440 --> 15:54.440
Sotús isn't in position,

15:54.640 --> 15:56.880
but he can't move
because it's getting light out.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.840
I don't know about the others.
It's hard to see because...

16:14.080 --> 16:15.120
Fuck, I missed!

16:32.040 --> 16:33.040
Get down!

16:33.240 --> 16:36.400
I have a saint watching over me!
He protects me from everything!

16:53.600 --> 16:55.000
Are you okay?

16:55.160 --> 16:57.400
- It's my arm and leg.
- Stay calm.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.319
Don't fall asleep.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.400
In War and Peace,

17:30.560 --> 17:34.960
Tolstoy remarks that military science
assumes that the bigger the army,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.080
the stronger it is.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.680
On the other hand,
only vaguely do they recognize

17:41.840 --> 17:45.000
that during military combat,
the final strength of an army

17:45.160 --> 17:51.600
is also its true physical capacity,
multiplied by one unknown "x. "

17:52.280 --> 17:56.120
This "x " is none other
than the spirit of the troops,

17:56.280 --> 18:02.280
measured as the greater or lesser desire
to fight and confront danger.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.000
Men with the desire to fight,

18:06.200 --> 18:09.000
who also understand
why they are fighting,

18:09.160 --> 18:11.200
regardless of who they are fighting,

18:11.360 --> 18:13.760
whether under the command
of military geniuses

18:13.920 --> 18:15.800
or those of normal intelligence,

18:15.960 --> 18:17.800
fighting with clubs

18:17.960 --> 18:21.760
or with machine guns
that fire 30 rounds a minute,

18:21.960 --> 18:23.280
these men will put themselves

18:23.440 --> 18:26.200
in the most advantageous conditions
for fighting,

18:26.400 --> 18:27.560
and they will triumph.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.160
Light this up! Come on!

18:44.080 --> 18:46.040
What are we going to do now?

18:46.200 --> 18:47.440
Take the barracks.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.480
Come on!

18:51.880 --> 18:54.160
Take this, motherfuckers!

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
From then on,

18:58.800 --> 19:02.680
Batista began to close
his Sierra Maestra barracks,

19:02.840 --> 19:04.200
and Fidel was right.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.840
It was exactly as José Marti said:

19:07.040 --> 19:09.400
Whoever takes the Sierra Maestra
takes Cuba.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.800
On our side, six
comrades are dead and 17 are wounded.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Of the 17, six can't walk.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.840
How is Almeida?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.200
He's fine. He's being treated.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.000
Get the prisoners.
They're coming with us.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.640
excuse me, doctor.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.120
I have no experience
in this kind of situation.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.800
There's a man over there
who is choking.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.840
Okay, guys, we gotta
get out of here. Come on, they're coming.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.280
Let's go, guys.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.920
Leave that.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.600
You're okay. Help him.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.280
Che, we have to leave right now.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.320
Hey, shithead. Leave that.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.080
We have to go! Come on!

20:10.400 --> 20:12.880
Israel Pardo's farm is not far.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.480
- Ernesto can take the wounded there.
- No.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.200
When they recover,

20:19.360 --> 20:21.800
we can meet up with you later.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.080
That could be very dangerous.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.840
They're going to flood
this area with troops now.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.760
Fidel. We don't have a choice.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.480
Let's think about it.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.560
Anyway, give him the best weapons.

20:44.520 --> 20:48.320
So Fidel is off
attacking towns to the west.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.600
Was it frustrating to you
as a revolutionary,

20:51.760 --> 20:54.240
nursing 20 wounded men,
trying to get them inland?

20:56.320 --> 21:00.080
A real
revolutionary goes where he is needed.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.040
It may not be direct combat.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.320
Sometimes it's about doing other tasks:

21:05.520 --> 21:09.720
finding food, dressing wounds,
carrying comrades for miles

21:09.880 --> 21:13.160
and then taking care of them
until they can take care of themselves.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.120
This is what it means.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.760
Was it during this period

21:16.920 --> 21:19.680
that you discovered
what you were fighting for?

21:21.400 --> 21:24.000
I always knew why I was fighting,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.800
but I can tell you that it was
during the March of the Wounded

21:27.960 --> 21:32.760
in June of 1957
that I became the fighter I am today.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.120
And once that happens,
it leaves you only one path.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.520
Then it seems you can never stop
being a revolutionary.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.720
I do not have any plans to retire.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.840
It's infected.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.280
We'll have to leave it uncovered.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.880
I have to walk with my ass naked?

21:56.040 --> 21:57.560
Fuck!

22:33.080 --> 22:35.360
Vilo smells something.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.800
Let's pick some guavas
before going back.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.040
Stop there, buddy.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.960
What are you two doing here?

22:53.600 --> 22:55.960
We're from here.
What's your name?

22:56.120 --> 22:58.120
Israel.
Israel what?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.480
Israel Pardo.

23:00.040 --> 23:04.440
- What's his name?
- He's my brother, Guile.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.800
- Ernesto Guevara.
- Did we scare you?

23:09.960 --> 23:11.080
Guile.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.560
Good, man, good.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.600
We have to take him to a hospital.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.800
Give me a swig.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.080
Can we trust anyone
to take him out of here?

23:49.520 --> 23:50.840
Difficult.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.840
Soldiers tell people that the rebels
kill them and steal their food.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.520
My mother is from here

24:01.680 --> 24:02.880
and my father came from Haiti.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.360
When he met my mother,

24:05.520 --> 24:09.480
we moved to a farm that belonged
to Juanito Echevarria.

24:09.640 --> 24:13.280
He gave us a piece
of land to grow coffee.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.960
But we had to clear it
and plant the seeds.

24:17.120 --> 24:22.920
And we had to give him
a third of our crop.

24:23.120 --> 24:28.520
And one day Juanito
decided to kick us out.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.040
When my father knew he had to leave,

24:32.200 --> 24:37.360
he stood in front
of Juanito Echevarria and said,

24:37.720 --> 24:40.720
"I'll leave if you want,
but you have to pay.

24:40.880 --> 24:46.080
You have to pay me
for the four years that I worked here. "

24:47.680 --> 24:51.400
Do you know what Juanito Echevarría
paid us for four years of work?

24:52.440 --> 24:54.280
One hundred pesos.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.640
My old man got 100 pesos
for four years.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.440
Be careful.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.280
Okay.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.040
This is the bullet
I removed from your body.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.600
You're a champ.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.280
- I'm going to get better now.
- Yes.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.360
COP 1 Let's go.
Keep them back, back.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.720
Keep them back.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.160
They have missiles aimed
at the United States.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.160
Good morning. Would
the commander like some makeup?

25:55.920 --> 25:56.960
- No.
- No, thank you.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.240
You sure? All right.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.080
Maybe a little powder.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.920
excuse me? excuse me.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.960
- Maybe a little powder?
- All right.

26:13.120 --> 26:17.760
Two hundred million
Latin Americans that die of hunger.

26:18.440 --> 26:23.840
All these people
contribute to the economic greatness

26:24.040 --> 26:25.960
of the United States.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.640
Revolutions are not exportable.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.440
Revolutions are created

26:35.600 --> 26:37.320
by the oppressive conditions

26:37.520 --> 26:39.640
that are imposed by
the Latin American governments

26:39.800 --> 26:41.520
against its people.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.800
Cut.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.760
Well done. Good job.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.840
Listen, I'd like to ask you
a few more questions off the record.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.560
- Should we do that?
- Yeah.

26:51.720 --> 26:56.200
If I don't work, I don't eat.
And you are on welfare.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.880
Go back to work in Cuba.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.440
The people of the Third World

27:01.600 --> 27:03.600
must be able to fight
for their own freedom,

27:03.760 --> 27:06.400
even if this means defying
the wishes of the Soviet bloc?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.160
Cuba doesn't align herself with blocs,

27:20.320 --> 27:21.560
she aligns herself with justice.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.080
The United States wants us
to pay a very high price

27:24.240 --> 27:27.240
for the not-so-peaceful coexistence
that we live in today.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.600
And we're willing to pay the price

27:36.760 --> 27:38.840
that takes us to the frontiers of dignity,

27:39.000 --> 27:40.200
not beyond.

27:40.840 --> 27:46.520
What's the point of the U.N.
if our fate is determined by the OAS,

27:47.480 --> 27:53.200
an organization that expelled us
and to which we no longer have ties?

27:53.960 --> 27:56.520
excuse me, Comandante.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.080
Will you need me tonight?

28:01.000 --> 28:07.840
Little boy, no one is so necessary
or indispensable in this life.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.480
Don't go thinking
that you are indispensable.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.480
Go, do what you need to do.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.440
I am going to give you
a little checkup...

28:30.600 --> 28:33.680
...beginning with your ears.
Is that okay?

28:38.400 --> 28:39.760
Ah...

28:43.120 --> 28:46.480
Too much work and not enough to eat.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.800
Maria, try to eat meat
whenever you can.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.040
- All right?
- Thanks, doctor.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.160
- Let's go, Laura.
- Goodbye.

28:57.320 --> 29:01.120
Mommy, that guy's a liar.
He says the same thing to everyone.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.360
- Where does it hurt?
- Nothing really hurts.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.520
I just came to see you because
I've never seen a doctor before.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.880
Well, you've seen one now.
I'm here for you.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.920
excuse me.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.240
Can I have your canteen,
so I can fill it?

29:26.800 --> 29:28.160
Thank you, Guile.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.760
Listen, doctor.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.240
I want to go with you all.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.280
First you have to learn
to read and write, man.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.160
I can learn.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.160
Very good, Guile.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.680
But I still can't take you
because I don't have a gun to give you.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.760
But I don't care, I want to help.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.000
We need your help here.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.960
- Where do you come from?
- From Bayamo.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.640
All of you?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.800
If you are armed, you can stay.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.520
If you're not,
you have to leave right now.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.360
Esteban, come here.

30:15.400 --> 30:19.120
Man, didn't I tell you to only
bring men with weapons?

30:21.960 --> 30:25.360
If we're attacked, how the hell
are they going to defend themselves?

30:27.600 --> 30:29.480
Have you been drinking?

30:30.520 --> 30:32.080
No.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.880
Where did you get that from?

30:40.440 --> 30:42.240
I found it.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.120
Hey.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.640
Listen, what's your name?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.200
Cuervo.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.720
Cuervo?

31:02.920 --> 31:04.880
How old are you?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.240
Twenty.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.880
They gave you a tremendous shotgun.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.840
They must like you.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
If they liked me
they'd let me keep my rifle

31:21.200 --> 31:23.280
and not this stupid shotgun.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.800
They would have made me
leader of a column,

31:25.960 --> 31:29.880
and we would be fighting by now
instead of crossing these mountains.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.000
With your permission, doctor.

31:59.200 --> 32:03.840
We were standing guard last night
but our relief never came.

32:04.040 --> 32:08.440
- We stayed until 6 in the morning.
- We never found out where they were.

32:08.600 --> 32:12.920
We try to follow the rules,
but it's not easy.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.160
Hey, Joel!

32:18.960 --> 32:21.400
Didn't you organize
the watch last night?

32:22.200 --> 32:24.040
Yes, sir. Why?

32:24.200 --> 32:28.520
Omar and Carlos were on watch
for four hours and relief never showed.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.400
Those guys are stupid shitheads.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.040
No, you're the only shithead here.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.880
Me? Why?

32:36.080 --> 32:41.040
Ernesto, they should've found out
where their relief was sleeping.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.360
- That's not my fault.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

32:45.880 --> 32:48.760
That was your responsibility.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.800
You organized the watch!
You had to guarantee the shift relief!

32:56.800 --> 32:59.200
- Fuck!
- Yes, sir.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.640
Tonight you'll stand watch
for four hours.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.040
Stay focused!

33:18.680 --> 33:20.320
It's ready, Che.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.880
Esteban left to meet Cuervo
at the sentry post.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.680
- When did he leave?
- Half an hour ago.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.800
Those bastards are gone!

33:38.440 --> 33:40.880
Bandera, come here.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.040
Esteban and Cuervo took off.
We have to find both of them.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.120
We're from Fidel's group.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.920
We're looking for food and money.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.920
You can put the money in this bag.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.159
The Comandante here
wants to talk to your daughter.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
We searched all over,

34:39.760 --> 34:41.199
but nothing.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.719
All right.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.520
Well,
it is impossible to defeat imperialism

35:00.480 --> 35:05.120
without identifying its head:
the United States of America.

35:05.320 --> 35:11.000
In a capitalist system,
most people live in an invisible cage.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.760
For example, there you accept
the myth of the self-made man,

35:16.400 --> 35:18.880
but don't understand that
the opportunities of most people

35:19.040 --> 35:23.160
are determined by forces
they do not even see.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.960
This is ugly.

36:12.320 --> 36:16.360
I want the vanguard a hundred meters
ahead of us at all times.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.400
We should bury them.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.640
Because yours is the kingdom,
the power and glory forever and ever.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.320
Amen.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.760
Che.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.640
Locals say there's a terrible battle
in the Estrada Palma military base.

36:38.800 --> 36:43.160
They say Raúl is wounded,
and that the army is coming toward us.

36:43.880 --> 36:47.160
Forget about it. We're surrounded.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.720
The only way out of here

36:50.880 --> 36:52.880
is to cut through el Turquino.

36:54.520 --> 36:57.000
I'm ready to take the mountain.

36:59.840 --> 37:04.320
- Good to see you again.
- Very, very eager to meet you.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.160
I want you to talk to Chris.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.200
He's this guy who's writing
this fabulous book.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.320
Are you hungry?
Would you like...?

37:13.680 --> 37:16.280
Yes, come on,
let's get something.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.440
I'll bring them back. Come on.

37:18.600 --> 37:22.560
Major Guevara, I'd like to introduce you
to Senator Eugene McCarthy.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.240
A pleasure. Pleasure, major.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.760
He would like to thank you

37:34.880 --> 37:36.320
for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.520
There was no better way

37:44.840 --> 37:48.760
to give the people solidarity
with its revolution

37:51.000 --> 37:52.400
like a U.S.- backed invasion.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.000
Some of our problems
we owe to the United States.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.360
Others are our own fault.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.120
Comandante, has the U.S. embargo
against Cuba

38:02.280 --> 38:03.920
succeeded in isolating it

38:04.080 --> 38:05.840
from the rest of Latin America?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.720
If Cuba is ever to be completely free,

38:11.920 --> 38:14.960
it has to be important not only
for sugar, for its sugar.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.520
Sir, would the Comandante object
to giving me his autograph?

38:18.680 --> 38:20.520
Good night.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.520
That was a good party.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.240
Vilo.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.440
- He says he wants to talk to you.
- I'm sorry.

39:27.600 --> 39:33.240
The problem is that one of your men
who says he is Lalo Sardiñas

39:33.400 --> 39:36.160
is down there with a group of rebels,

39:37.280 --> 39:39.560
and if a patrol arrives

39:39.720 --> 39:43.920
they're going to burn my shack
and kill my family.

39:44.360 --> 39:48.160
And that can't happen! No way!

39:49.680 --> 39:53.680
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Ernesto Guevara.

39:53.880 --> 39:57.640
- What's your name?
- Emilio Cabrera.

39:57.800 --> 40:02.360
Emilio, don't worry.
No one is going to touch anything.

40:04.200 --> 40:09.920
Vilo, tell people to get ready,
they're about to meet Fidel Castro.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.160
No, now listen to me.

40:15.320 --> 40:19.840
Raúl wasn't really wounded.
We were the ones surrounding the army.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.800
And those bastards escaped.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.160
Boy!

40:23.680 --> 40:25.800
Come on, motherfucker.
Give me a hug.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.160
How are you?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.200
Here.

40:33.120 --> 40:37.080
- Where did you get those peasants?
- Those are my troops, man.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.320
They're working out all right.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.160
I don't speak out loud
because they'll get big heads.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.920
We've missed you.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.440
Some coffee?

40:58.560 --> 41:00.040
Hey, Joel.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.920
Fidel asked me
why I hadn't made you lieutenant.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.280
I told him because you didn't know
how to read or write.

41:08.560 --> 41:12.080
Well, I want to learn.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.960
But I need someone to teach me.

41:16.120 --> 41:19.040
Then get a pencil
and a pair of notebooks

41:19.200 --> 41:21.080
and put them in your backpack.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.960
Look, Che.

41:24.120 --> 41:27.440
This is the new recruit
I wanted to introduce to you.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.320
Dr. Martínez Páez.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.720
- Doctor?
- Doctor.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.320
Pleased to meet you.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.680
I have a present here.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.840
From now on,

41:41.360 --> 41:44.320
I stop being the medic
to become a guerrilla.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.520
- What, are you giving up your job?
- Yes, sir.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.840
- Who are they?
- Chibás and Pazos.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.760
They're signing an agreement.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.680
What agreement?

42:03.760 --> 42:05.560
A political alliance.

42:08.440 --> 42:11.080
During the early
stages of the revolution,

42:11.240 --> 42:14.560
wasn't there a conflict between Fidel
and the urban movement?

42:16.160 --> 42:18.160
I would say the only conflict we've had

42:18.360 --> 42:21.560
- was with Fulgencio Batista.
- Are you saying

42:21.760 --> 42:24.760
you had no conflict
with the urban movement?

42:25.680 --> 42:28.000
We differed in our tactics.

42:28.200 --> 42:31.560
They wanted to oust Batista
with a general strike,

42:31.720 --> 42:35.520
and we wanted to overthrow him
with an armed struggle.

42:35.680 --> 42:36.920
And as you can see,

42:37.080 --> 42:40.000
our method proved the most effective
for removing Batista.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.120
All right, gentlemen.

42:42.280 --> 42:49.280
The provisional government, first, will free
all political prisoners, civilian and military.

42:49.560 --> 42:55.200
Second, it will guarantee freedom
of information for the radio and press,

42:55.400 --> 43:01.200
and individual and political rights
established in the 1940 Constitution.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.240
The provisional government will also
establish terms for the Agrarian Reform

43:05.400 --> 43:08.240
leading to the distribution
of public lands.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.240
Have a good trip.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.880
Excuse me, Fidel.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.240
I can't understand how you can
meet with those clowns,

43:21.400 --> 43:24.560
and much less, how you can
make an agreement with them.

43:24.760 --> 43:27.680
They're fighting against
the same enemy we are.

43:29.280 --> 43:34.240
No, you're fighting,
they're negotiating.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.000
They have lots of followers, Ernesto.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.000
People I can't afford to turn away.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.920
Let's see how it goes.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.960
But I'm sure that if we win the war,

43:46.160 --> 43:48.520
those guys will
hand the keys over to the U.S.

43:48.760 --> 43:54.640
Listen, when this war is won,
no one's handing any keys to anybody.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.560
I'll guarantee you that.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.320
Come here, I need you
to sign something for me.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.720
It's a letter of condolence
for Frank Pais.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.600
They killed his brother in Santiago.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.280
They killed his brother?

44:15.440 --> 44:17.280
Sign as "Comandante."

44:18.760 --> 44:20.480
Sign as "Comandante."

44:23.720 --> 44:27.080
I'm forming a new column
on the eastern side of Mount Turquino.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.480
You'll have three captains:

44:29.640 --> 44:30.680
Lalo Sardiñas,

44:30.840 --> 44:32.320
Ramiro Valdés

44:32.520 --> 44:33.920
and Ciro Redondo.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.800
You have to wear out
Mosquera's troops,

44:38.000 --> 44:41.440
harass them constantly.
Don't let up on them.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.920
Don't even let them breathe!

44:44.080 --> 44:45.800
You cannot give them a break.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.520
I want you to establish a base
at el Hombrito.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.040
Got it?

44:55.000 --> 44:58.920
No one can leave a wounded comrade
on the battlefield.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.560
Right?

45:00.760 --> 45:05.520
If any of you leave weapons behind
during battle or anywhere else,

45:05.760 --> 45:07.840
you'll have to go back for it, alone.

45:08.600 --> 45:12.360
And if anyone falls asleep on guard duty,
he won't eat for three days.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.960
Is that clear?

45:16.560 --> 45:18.200
Thank you, Ciro.

45:18.400 --> 45:21.280
I want to say something else

45:22.760 --> 45:25.400
to make myself clear.

45:27.040 --> 45:31.000
We respect the peasants,

45:31.560 --> 45:34.720
so no one is allowed
to touch their harvest

45:34.920 --> 45:38.360
or mess with them

45:38.560 --> 45:40.400
or their families.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.280
If anyone does,

45:44.200 --> 45:47.400
he will be punished to the full extent
of the revolutionary code.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.040
Luis!

45:57.000 --> 45:58.240
Come here.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.040
Here you go.
Take care of it like it's your girlfriend.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.160
Thank you, Comandante.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.800
Do you need help, Comandante?

46:28.280 --> 46:29.560
No.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.600
- Gustavo.
- Yes, Comandante.

46:55.800 --> 46:59.120
Take your math notebook out
and do some work.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.120
I'm exhausted, Comandante.

47:05.480 --> 47:06.760
Okay.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.600
What is the most important quality

47:20.800 --> 47:23.000
for a revolutionary to possess?

47:24.480 --> 47:25.880
Love.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.280
Love?

47:28.840 --> 47:32.360
Let me tell you something,
at the risk of sounding ridiculous.

47:32.520 --> 47:37.320
A true revolutionary is guided
by great feelings of love:

47:38.000 --> 47:42.560
love of humanity, of justice
and truth.

47:42.720 --> 47:46.200
It is impossible to conceive
of an authentic revolutionary

47:46.360 --> 47:47.840
without this one quality.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.040
Don't move, asshole!

48:22.240 --> 48:23.680
- Please don't shoot!
- Freeze!

48:23.840 --> 48:25.160
I'm a doctor.

48:25.800 --> 48:28.320
Che, they're shooting mortars!

48:29.200 --> 48:30.920
How many men are in your troop?

48:31.080 --> 48:32.440
One hundred forty.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.760
Under whose command?

48:37.760 --> 48:39.240
Merob Sosa.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.240
- Mortars!
- Let's go.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.200
- Tell me.
- Ramiro.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.480
Go back and keep shooting
until Lalo Sardiñas' squad has passed.

48:57.080 --> 49:00.360
We'll do a second line of resistance

49:00.520 --> 49:04.040
up there, on the hill,
200 meters away.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.400
- See you.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.200
That's Gustavo!

49:25.360 --> 49:27.480
No, Roberto! Roberto!

49:37.400 --> 49:39.400
Are you optimistic
about the normalization of relations

49:41.640 --> 49:44.400
between Cuba and the United States?

49:45.800 --> 49:47.720
Friends, it would be very difficult,

49:48.360 --> 49:50.720
it would take many, many years.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.960
By this, I mean
with the U.S. government,

49:53.120 --> 49:55.760
because we have nothing against
the American people.

49:55.920 --> 49:59.800
There is not even a trace of hatred
in our country for the American people.

50:00.480 --> 50:03.800
Comandante, there's a page missing.

50:03.960 --> 50:07.320
- How is this possible?
- The fourteenth.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.640
Here is the page. It's torn out.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.680
Excuse me, Comandante.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.040
There's a small problem.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.320
Bomb threat at the U.N.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.600
What did he say?

50:31.800 --> 50:34.080
They called the station 30 minutes ago.

50:39.280 --> 50:43.120
Hector, you go with Pedro and the
Cuban delegation in the second car,

50:43.280 --> 50:44.560
and I will go in the first car.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.320
I think I should go with you.

50:46.520 --> 50:48.200
I didn't ask your opinion.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.440
Comandante, with all due respect,

50:53.640 --> 50:55.480
I came here to protect you.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.480
And I'd like you to give me
that opportunity, at least.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.760
- That way we'll die together if...
- No one is going to die.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.720
Traitor!

51:10.840 --> 51:13.520
Go away! Traitor! Murderer!

51:20.520 --> 51:23.400
Not only did you desert
with your weapon

51:24.040 --> 51:27.160
and terrorize the area,
stealing from the poor

51:27.320 --> 51:29.320
in the name of the revolution,

51:30.840 --> 51:32.520
but also, because of your betrayal,

51:32.680 --> 51:37.120
peasants were tortured
and murdered by Batista's army.

51:39.080 --> 51:40.520
Why, Esteban?

51:41.360 --> 51:43.640
The punishment for treason is death.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.920
And you

51:50.400 --> 51:54.840
boasted of your authority
as a messenger for the Rebel Army,

51:55.600 --> 51:59.160
and passing yourself off
as Comandante Almeida

52:00.880 --> 52:03.400
you raped
Juan Carlos Estévez's daughter,

52:06.360 --> 52:08.360
a teenager,

52:09.560 --> 52:12.560
and this also
deserves the death penalty.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.160
Bring him here.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.280
Would you like a sip of rum?

53:00.160 --> 53:02.080
Roberto, give him a swig.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.600
Do you have a last wish?

53:16.920 --> 53:18.960
Let me confess to Father Chávez.

53:20.280 --> 53:23.760
We can't bring you the priest.
He's far away, we have no time.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.360
- Something else?
- Then give me another swig.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.120
Give him another.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.000
Ready.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.000
Aim.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.720
Make sure everyone knows
I asked for my last confession.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.280
Fire!

54:00.160 --> 54:02.640
Mr. President, fellow delegates.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.200
The world has developed a great deal
in this political arena,

54:05.400 --> 54:08.320
but American imperialism, above all,

54:08.480 --> 54:11.280
has led people to believe
that peaceful coexistence

54:11.480 --> 54:15.840
is the exclusive right
of the world's most powerful nations.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.760
Cuba, my fellow delegates,
free and sovereign,

54:19.920 --> 54:22.360
with no chains tying it to anyone,

54:22.520 --> 54:26.200
without foreign investments
in its territory,

54:26.360 --> 54:29.520
free from occupant military bosses
determining political status,

54:29.680 --> 54:32.920
can stand tall at this assembly

54:33.080 --> 54:36.640
and demonstrate the correctness
of the cry with which it was baptized.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.520
Free territory of America!

54:51.960 --> 54:57.440
The United States intervenes in Latin
America claiming they defend freedom.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.760
One day this assembly
will acquire enough maturity

55:02.240 --> 55:06.840
to demand equal rights for blacks

55:07.080 --> 55:09.320
and Latin Americans living
in this country

55:09.480 --> 55:13.480
as they awaken from the long, brutal sleep
to which they've been subjected.

55:13.640 --> 55:16.800
We need to say here

55:17.000 --> 55:19.360
something that is a known truth.

55:20.560 --> 55:23.880
And this is a truth we have always
presented to the world.

55:24.440 --> 55:28.600
Executions? Yes, we have executed.

55:28.760 --> 55:33.720
We execute, and we'll continue
to execute when it is necessary.

55:33.920 --> 55:37.240
Our fight is a fight to death.

55:37.680 --> 55:41.240
These are the conditions
in which we live

55:41.400 --> 55:44.640
because of the imposition
of American imperialism.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.440
Good morning.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.600
How are you, doctor?

55:57.160 --> 55:58.840
- Good.
- And my brother?

55:59.000 --> 56:00.480
Very good.

56:00.920 --> 56:05.640
- What's your name?
- He's Enrique, my brother.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.320
We're from Remedios.

56:08.480 --> 56:11.400
We worked
for the 26th of July Movement.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.760
My brother and I, with a group,

56:14.920 --> 56:17.960
tried to burn down the stable
at the town barracks,

56:18.120 --> 56:22.560
but one of the soldiers
identified my brother,

56:22.840 --> 56:25.800
so we came here to find Fidel.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
- What's your name?
- Rogelio Acevedo.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.920
- How old are you, Rogelio?
- Sixteen.

56:34.080 --> 56:35.800
- And you?
- Fourteen.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.840
Sixteen and 14.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.920
I can't accept you, you're too young.

56:44.080 --> 56:47.520
- What are you here for?
- Same reasons as you.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.040
Is that so? Very good.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.760
Do you know how to read and write?

56:54.240 --> 56:55.600
No.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.680
Raise your hands, the ones
who know how to read and write.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.160
So you know how to read and write?

57:09.320 --> 57:12.600
Yes, Comandante.
I made it through 6th grade.

57:13.560 --> 57:18.280
We are not here in the middle
of the mountains just to fire guns.

57:19.280 --> 57:22.320
A country that doesn't know
how to read and write

57:22.520 --> 57:25.040
is easy to deceive.

57:25.840 --> 57:28.600
Since none of you have weapons,

57:29.800 --> 57:33.240
I'm picking only eight of you.
The rest will have to go.

57:33.440 --> 57:35.760
This is no piece of cake,
we're here to fight.

57:35.920 --> 57:40.200
We won't eat for days.
We'll sleep on the ground in the rain.

57:40.360 --> 57:42.800
We're risking our lives here.

57:43.560 --> 57:44.880
Is that clear?

57:45.080 --> 57:47.080
- Yes.
- Is that absolutely clear?

57:47.360 --> 57:48.880
Sure?

57:49.040 --> 57:51.440
Good. You will be a teacher.

57:51.600 --> 57:55.720
And the rest will learn from her.
You came here to fight and to learn.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.160
Okay?

57:57.800 --> 57:59.480
And you?

57:59.840 --> 58:02.240
- Come on, boys, you gotta go.
- No.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.200
Fuck, no. You have to go.

58:04.360 --> 58:07.240
If I have to go back to Remedios
I'd rather shoot myself.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.240
Me too.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.800
My God.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.080
- Are you listening?
- Let's go, man.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.960
Let's get moving.

58:18.840 --> 58:20.360
Come on.

58:40.570 --> 58:42.290
Wait, wait!

58:45.930 --> 58:47.290
You can't do that, man.

58:47.530 --> 58:49.770
Stand up!
You're stopping the column!

58:49.970 --> 58:51.570
- Hold my gun.
- Let's go.

58:57.770 --> 59:00.250
The next letter is...

59:01.170 --> 59:02.970
No? Look.

59:03.130 --> 59:05.330
Here. Yello...

59:06.210 --> 59:09.490
Excuse me, Che.
He says he needs to talk to you.

59:09.650 --> 59:10.730
What's going on?

59:10.890 --> 59:14.930
Comandante, Camilo calls me
a bad word every time he sees me.

59:15.090 --> 59:17.970
- What bad word?
- Something rude I don't like.

59:18.130 --> 59:21.090
Go and get Camilo.
Like what?

59:21.290 --> 59:24.810
I don't want to be a bother, but I'm a man
who shouldn't be disrespected.

59:25.010 --> 59:26.930
everyone is laughing
and making fun of me.

59:27.170 --> 59:30.290
I don't really understand
what he's saying, but I don't like it.

59:30.450 --> 59:32.930
What's going on, Comandante?

59:33.090 --> 59:34.530
Albertico.

59:35.690 --> 59:37.330
What's the story?

59:38.010 --> 59:41.010
Okay, friend, now tell me
what Camilo's been saying to you?

59:41.410 --> 59:44.690
He calls me "vanilla piss."

59:46.650 --> 59:49.290
Ventriloquist, man, ventriloquist.

59:49.490 --> 59:53.130
- That's not a bad word.
- But it sounds bad. I don't like it.

59:53.290 --> 59:56.290
A ventriloquist is someone
who talks without moving his mouth.

59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.730
- Why are you calling me that?
- Yes, Camilo, why?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.330
Because he's a good messenger

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:06.530
and he's always popping up
with information,

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:11.250
and he reminds me of a ventriloquist
puppet that moves like this.

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:13.090
Albertico, it's not a bad word.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.810
It's not an insult, man.
I say it with affection.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:18.090
- He's a very good messenger.
- Really?

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:22.090
No, it's true. He's doing things
really well. He's always there.

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:23.490
Yes, he is.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:25.130
You wanna play ball, Che?

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:29.930
Today is a perfect day to abandon
the guerrilla movement.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:35.370
Another chance like this
may not come along for weeks.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.570
Let's see.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:42.650
Anyone who'd like to leave
this column, step forward.

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.210
Stand up there.

01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.690
Come on,
the quitters and the horses' asses!

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.170
Stay there.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.770
I'm not leaving because I'm scared.
I have a pain and...

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.010
You are a moron. Shut up.

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:17.930
- My mother is sick.
- You are a moron!

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:24.810
You'll have to give back everything
that belongs to the column.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.970
You're a bunch of cowards.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.090
You have 30 minutes
to get out of here.

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:36.810
If we find you, you're deserters.
Israel, Roberto, take them out.

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:42.330
Dickhead, aren't you leaving with them?

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:44.650
Another faggot.

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:48.970
Anyone else?

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.610
So did you grow balls?

01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:58.850
We can still stand a little bit more.

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:03.130
You already behaved with dignity,

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:07.690
but you have no chance
of adapting to this warfare.

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.770
Okay, I'll make an exception.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.850
I'll let you take your things with you,
I'll give you a guide

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.490
and 10 pesos to each of you.

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:20.890
Comandante.

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:24.290
I think you should
forgive me in advance,

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.130
as I know you will not like
what I'm going to say.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:33.490
If we joined the troops,
it wasn't to go back humiliated.

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:36.690
We prefer, and I speak for both,

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:40.330
to die on this mountain rather than
return home as failures.

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:44.090
We'll make the maximum effort
even if it costs our lives.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.850
This is the last straw.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:51.530
While the strong
grow weaker and leave,

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:54.410
these snot-nosed kids
get more courageous.

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.090
Is there any logic here?

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:11.090
The important ones aren't the ones
who leave, but the ones who stay

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:13.410
and the ones
who will join us in the future.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.690
Listen to me.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:18.930
Comandantes Raúl and Almeida
will come with me.

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.050
They will open the second
and third front with their columns.

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.570
Camilo

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:27.330
will replace Sardiñas
as your new captain.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.250
Damn.

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:35.170
Look how generous the revolution is.

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.130
Individualism,

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:01.850
the isolated action of a person

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.130
alone in a social environment,
must disappear in Cuba.

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:09.090
But are people built that way?
Isn't it really human nature?

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:12.610
It is very easy to claim
that in capitalism,

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:19.650
the individual has the option to satisfy
or to express true human nature.

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:23.570
A child has one toy and wants two.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:30.290
That child gets two toys and wants four.
This is human nature, isn't it?

01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:33.890
But when a whole society
behaves in the same way,

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:38.770
or when it becomes a monopoly,
oppressing the less fortunate,

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.130
is that human nature?

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.730
It is then that one has to stand up
and do something.

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:48.010
And aren't you acting as
an individual? Isn't Fidel an individual?

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.650
Yes, of course, we are individuals

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:54.650
who have accepted the challenge

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:58.850
and the responsibility to lead
in the name of a society as a whole.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.130
Long live free Cuba!

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:20.530
Will they have much time to respond?

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.570
Each one will have 10 minutes.

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:28.170
- From the podium?
No, from the floor.

01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:31.690
- And my rebuttal?
Ten minutes.

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:36.850
- Also from the floor?
- No, from the podium.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:45.170
My government has nothing to do
with the fact that every day,

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:50.010
in Cuban circles, to bolster
the illusions of the Cuban people,

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:55.210
they announce
the formation of invading brigades

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.450
armed with revolvers

01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:01.730
and small-caliber weapons
to confront an army that,

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:06.090
according to
the declarations of their leaders,

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:11.730
has at their disposal,
the most modern nuclear arms.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.170
The collective and individual actions

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:19.930
of the governments of this hemisphere
to restrict trade with Cuba

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:21.890
are defensive measures,

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:24.450
taken in response
to Cuba's continued promotion

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:28.970
of subversion and violence
elsewhere in this hemisphere.

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:33.130
We do not support or condone
hit-and-run attacks

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:38.450
against ships in the Cuban trade,
or against other targets in Cuba.

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:42.450
The surveillance flights are authorized

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.330
by the resolution approved
by the Organization of American States

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:51.050
under the Rio Treaty
on 23 October 1962.

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:55.650
Absolutely false are the accusations

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.970
that acts of genocide are being
committed in Venezuela.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:04.810
Moreover,
it is simply absurd and intolerable

01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:07.250
that a Cuban representative

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:11.090
dares to make judgments
about Venezuelan sovereignty,

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:16.170
the unique and exclusive patrimony
of the Venezuelan people,

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:19.690
a truly free people,

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:22.290
which has a democratic government

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:26.170
with elections whose legitimacy
are known to the entire world.

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.610
The tragedy of the Cuban revolution

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:34.970
Lies in not having known how to
institutionalize this great movement

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:38.210
into an administration
with legal rights in the Americas.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.930
The greatest flaw of their leaders

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:45.970
is that they suffer from excessive vanity
which blinds them

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:49.290
and prevents them
from observing past examples

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:51.530
which are typical of America,

01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:55.490
like the Mexican revolution in 1910.

01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:02.010
I, who lived many years
of my youth in Cuba,

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.810
and who perhaps
feels more than Che Guevara

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.290
that there has been
enough suffering

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:11.010
and pain for the Cuban people.

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:16.170
In my brief reply to your capricious
intervention into Panamanian issues,

01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.689
I'd like to finish by saying to you:

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.649
Don't defend me, compadre.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:06.250
Vilo!

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.210
Take the sick to the shelter!

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:10.250
To the shelter!
Take them to the shelter.

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.410
Don't run. Don't run.

01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:28.890
Hurry up!

01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:31.330
Come on!

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:02.130
One, two, three.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:10.850
Polo. Take the prisoners
to your house and keep them there.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:16.290
Polo. Make sure no one mistreats them,
verbally or physically.

01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:19.130
- Understood, Roberto?
- Sure.

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:22.170
Come on, walk!

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.490
Che!

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.330
They killed Ciro.
They shot him in the head.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.250
We couldn't recover his body.

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:20.570
May I talk to you for a second, sir?

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.090
They were very well organized.

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:32.650
- More than we expected?
- Much more.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:37.730
They have a school, hospital,
printing press, a power plant.

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:39.890
They must have been here months.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.130
What do you want me to do with this?

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.330
Torch it.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:54.330
I need you to go to Minas del Frio

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:56.450
and create a training camp.

01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.530
What for?

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:05.890
I want you to be personally
in charge of the new recruits.

01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:09.850
What about my column?

01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:13.250
Ramiro can take your place for now.

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.770
You know we're days away
from an attack.

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:26.290
- I don't understand.
- This is more important.

01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:30.170
It makes sense, teach.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:33.610
Who can do that better than you?

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.850
Tell me. No one, man.

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:40.570
Look, when this is over,

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:45.050
Cuba and the revolution
will need you even more.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:51.370
After the loss of El Hombrito,

01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:56.050
Fidel took away your column
and sent you to train new recruits.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.570
- Did you feel it was a demotion?
No.

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:00.610
Was that what you thought at the time?

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:05.170
Even if I had a different opinion,

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:09.690
even if I felt I had been demoted,

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:13.170
I knew Fidel had his reasons,
and you can be sure of that.

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:15.290
And around this same time,

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:20.410
many others were trying to do this
in a more peaceful way.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:23.490
Yes, that is why
Fidel backed the general strike.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.130
But he always made it very clear

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:29.370
that we were the only ones capable
of defeating the enemy.

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:31.530
A t the outset,

01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:35.130
a lot of the other rebel groups
didn't share Fidel's belief

01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:38.930
that agrarian reform was a core principle
of the revolution.

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.250
What was the turning point?

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:44.610
How did he finally bring them around?

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:47.210
After the failure
of the general strike of April 9th,

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:48.450
there was no more doubt.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:50.730
The 26th of July Movement

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.490
was the only group
that could defeat Batista.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:56.890
That is what a leader does:
He convinces people to share his vision.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:01.410
Are you a leader?
Do you get people to share your vision?

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.010
He wants me to tell you

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.090
that you have proved one thing
to him for sure:

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:10.650
He would rather face a soldier
than a journalist.

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.530
They see us rebels as agitators,

01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:17.730
people who want to gain prestige
by complicating Batista's life.

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:19.530
But we don't see ourselves like that.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:23.530
We see ourselves as a small army
that will become a bigger army...

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:28.370
Fidel has to be the commander
in chief of the entire rebellion.

01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:33.410
But we have to propose it with tact.

01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:38.690
Our relationship with the Communist Party
still makes people nervous.

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:44.210
We raised funds by naming Fidel

01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:47.210
as leader of our revolution.

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:52.650
Outside of Cuba, he's the only
recognizable figure we've got.

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:57.290
No one is saying that
in the plains they screwed up.

01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:59.610
But what is clear
in the Sierra Maestra

01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:03.930
is that defeating Batista doesn't
assure the end of the dictatorship.

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:07.290
We also have to overthrow
Batista's army

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:10.050
in order to prevent another coup.

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:13.050
Being under the command
of the Soviet Union

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:16.930
isn't any better than being under
the command of the United States.

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:21.250
Latour, you're still thinking
like a colonized person does.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.330
Cuba won't be under
anyone's command.

01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:27.730
Cuba is for the Cuban people.

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:32.290
I'll do everything I can
with the Stalinists from the PSP,

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.450
but I don't think it will be worth it.

01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:40.610
And we understand it, Faustino.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:43.370
That's precisely why
we always want to include...

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.450
"Stalinists"?

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:51.250
From now on, the coordination
of the plains militias

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:57.010
will serve the needs
of the guerrillas in the Sierra Maestra.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:01.610
Fidel Castro will become commander
in chief of all the armed forces.

01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:05.490
Long live the revolution!

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:21.450
I want to congratulate you, Fidel,

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:25.770
because today you entered the path
of the greatest men of the Americas.

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:29.690
A path that

01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:32.450
will prove to the world

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:38.050
it's possible to get to power
with an armed struggle

01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:40.210
supported by the people.

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:45.330
It's not only me, Ernesto.

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.650
It's all of us.

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:51.570
This wouldn't be possible
if I were on my own.

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:58.050
I want you to organize a new front.

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:01.130
Once we start this offensive,

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:04.050
I want to take the war down
from the Sierra Maestra into the plains.

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:10.210
You'll have to unite
all the rebel factions.

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:15.490
We have to take control of Las Villas
Province, dividing the island in two.

01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:20.050
Camilo's going to head in the same
direction, leading his own column.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.290
There will be no victory in Havana

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:28.010
without victory in Las Villas.

01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:34.610
Getting all the groups to work together
will be difficult, Ernesto.

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:38.290
So I hope you have sharpened
your political skills.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.290
And one other thing.

01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:45.730
I know you are very reckless,

01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:49.210
but you can't always
put yourself on the frontline.

01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:51.810
You are too important to us.

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.730
It's an order.

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:05.970
I want to respond
to the Nicaraguan delegate

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:10.770
even though I did not understand
his argument about accent.

01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:14.570
I believe he referred to Cuba,

01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:19.890
Argentina and somewhat
to Russia of the Soviet Union.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:22.250
In any event,

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:27.650
I hope the Nicaraguan delegate found
no North American accent in my speech,

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:30.770
because that would be truly dangerous.

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.610
But one thing is for sure,
we don't commit assassinations

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.810
like the ones being committed
right at this moment

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:42.370
by the political police of Venezuela
who are called DIGEPOL

01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:44.410
if I am not misinformed.

01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:47.850
This police force has committed
a series of barbarous acts,

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:51.290
executions,
which is to say assassinations.

01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:53.810
The Panamanian delegate,

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.690
who has been kind enough
to call me "Che"

01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:58.890
as I am called by the Cuban people,

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:01.970
began speaking
about the Mexican revolution.

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:06.530
While Cuba spoke about the
North American massacre in Panama,

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:08.730
the Panamanian delegation

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:13.290
continued speaking in this vein,
without referring at all

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:18.570
to that American massacre for which

01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:23.930
the Panamanian government broke off
relations to the United States.

01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:28.290
On to Mr. Stevenson.
Regrettably, he is not present here.

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:34.490
Mr. Stevenson again claims
there is no violation of the law

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:39.370
that neither airplanes nor boats
leave from here and, of course,

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:43.770
that pirate attacks just happen.
They just come out of nowhere.

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:51.450
Due to the demands of imperialism,
our prime minister declared five points

01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:54.730
to secure peace in the Caribbean.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.450
And these are...

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:57.650
First:

01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:03.210
A halt to the economic blockade
and all forms of commercial pressure

01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:08.970
imposed by the United States
all over the world against our country.

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:12.490
Second: Halt all subversive activities,

01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:17.570
such as the launch and distribution
of arms and explosives by air and water,

01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:20.050
organization of mercenary invasions,

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.410
infiltration of spies and saboteurs,

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:27.850
and all actions carried out
from the territory of the United States

01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:30.650
or accomplice countries.

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:32.490
Third:

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:36.730
Halt all pirate attacks
carried out from bases located

01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:39.850
in the United States and Puerto Rico.

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:47.850
Fourth: Halt all airspace
and territorial water violations

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:51.730
by U.S. aircraft and warships.

01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:55.770
Fifth: Withdrawal from
the Guantánamo naval base

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:59.610
and return of Cuban territory
occupied by the U.S.

01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:10.490
This great mass of humanity has said
"Enough!" and has stepped forward.

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:16.410
This march of giants will not stop
until true independence is won,

01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:20.810
for which so many died in vain.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:24.650
All of this, my fellow delegates,

01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:28.370
is the new stance
of the American continent,

01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:31.610
a stance captured by the cry

01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:34.850
that is shouted
every day by our people

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:38.250
as an expression of our
irrefutable decision to fight,

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:41.050
paralyzing the strikes
of armed intruders,

01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:45.650
an outcry that counts the support
of all the people of the world

01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:50.410
and especially the socialist camp
headed by the Soviet Union.

01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:54.530
This cry is " Homeland or death!"

01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:15.250
Che!

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:21.330
That's Las Villas, behind the clouds.

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:34.970
Camilo arrived a few weeks ago
and we put ourselves under his command.

01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:36.650
Very good.

01:22:36.850 --> 01:22:39.930
- I see you received our supplies.
- Yes, thanks.

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:42.250
Of all the groups operating in the area,

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:45.050
the Communist Party
was the only one to send help.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.810
I'm not surprised, Comandante.

01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:50.770
Most of these groups
are too busy fighting each other.

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:56.610
Months ago, Menoyo broke from
the Directory, creating a Second Front.

01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:59.330
Since then, each one has carved out
its own territory.

01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:02.570
There's been open hostility
between the two factions.

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:06.090
Where does the 26th of July Movement
stand in all of this?

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:10.210
Recently,
Menoyo met with Víctor Bordón.

01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:13.610
I think both groups

01:23:13.770 --> 01:23:15.850
are on the brink
of an armed confrontation.

01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:19.650
We're ready to cooperate
with the 26th of July Movement

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:22.610
in all military maneuvers.

01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:26.530
We even agree with agrarian reform

01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:30.930
as long as it's done reasonably

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:33.770
and brings in money.

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:38.650
Landowners should be pressured

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:43.250
to sell their idle land to the peasants.

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:45.770
But it should be sold at cost.

01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:48.690
Will you be the one fixing the price?

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.650
How can a peasant
with no money buy land?

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:56.690
But what do you want?
Just give it to them?

01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:59.490
So they can destroy it
like they did in Mexico?

01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:02.490
The owner of the land
is the one who works it.

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:09.050
Comandante, you have permission
to institute agrarian reform in the region,

01:24:09.330 --> 01:24:13.410
but the Second Front will continue
to charge the land taxes.

01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:18.890
Menoyo, the region belongs to us all.
What we have to do here is fight.

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:22.650
The only thing the Directory won't do

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:27.130
is any kind of deal
with Menoyo's Second Front.

01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:30.970
We'll never do business
with that bunch of bandits.

01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:33.930
We need to attack
all the army garrisons in the area.

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:35.970
But you can't attack
Güinia de Miranda,

01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:37.530
because that zone is ours.

01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:41.730
We have more experience
and more weapons than you do.

01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:45.530
Do you think the Americans are just
going to sit and watch this happen?

01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:47.650
No, man, listen.

01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:55.090
We shouldn't be doing things
so openly.

01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:00.570
So you're one of those who think
we can make a revolution

01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:03.290
behind the backs of the Americans?

01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:08.330
No, man.
A real revolution cannot be hidden.

01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:11.850
I can do more
with the 400 rifles I have

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:15.010
than you can with your little bazooka

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:19.570
and all the balls your troops may have.

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:25.850
Look, Peña, the day I have
to take arms against my comrades

01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:28.490
will be the day I stop fighting.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:34.490
If you don't take Güinia de Miranda
in five days, we'll do it ourselves.

01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:39.530
I am Comandante Ernesto Guevara.

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:44.970
He is Comandante Ramiro Valdés.

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:48.210
And he is Captain Victor Bordón.

01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:53.810
I just want to say three things.

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:55.690
First:

01:25:56.250 --> 01:26:01.370
From now on, I am the only one

01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:05.690
in charge of the region of Las Villas.

01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:07.930
Second:

01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:12.090
We will enforce strict discipline.

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:15.730
And third:

01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:19.530
The fighting is going to intensify.

01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:26.130
Whoever is not ready to sacrifice
himself for his homeland

01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:28.730
can leave his gun on the ground

01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:31.530
and abandon the column

01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:34.010
immediately.

01:26:45.970 --> 01:26:47.130
Fire.

01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:18.410
Give it to me, damn it!

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.530
Homeland or death!

01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:04.290
You're ready?

01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:14.970
Thank you.

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:27.370
Tell Oltuski the money
will be put to good use.

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:29.090
Will do.

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:33.690
excuse me.

01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:37.650
The police are looking for me
in Santa Clara and want to arrest me.

01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:40.890
I need to stay here.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:45.050
Well, you can stay
and work in the infirmary,

01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:47.890
because we don't allow people
to just hang around.

01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:51.930
I want you to know that
for the last two years

01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:54.290
I've been working
in the clandestine movement.

01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:58.490
I've been taking weapons, bombs
and fugitives all across the province.

01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:01.730
I think that gives me the right
to become a guerrilla.

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:03.090
Okay.

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:06.290
We've started taxing

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.010
some of the largest landowners.

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.970
I need someone to collect the money.

01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:15.050
You can start with that
and then we'll see.

01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:16.850
Thanks.

01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:18.810
Ramiro.

01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:22.770
- The girl here will collect the taxes.
- Okay.

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.370
Finally
we were working with the other groups.

01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:41.770
It was like a wave.

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:47.210
When we arrived in the towns,
people received us with open arms,

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:49.610
and many of them even joined us.

01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:52.330
And you took a lot of towns
in less than a week.

01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:55.650
Isn't it now called
"the lightning campaign "?

01:29:55.810 --> 01:29:58.890
True, but in reality,
the battle had been building steam

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:02.330
for nearly 100 years.

01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:08.050
When people hate their government,
it's not very hard to take a town.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.330
One machine gun, 180 rifles

01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:26.370
and 9,000 rounds of ammunition.

01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:30.290
Victor, we need you to blow
the Cabaiguán bridge.

01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:32.570
The Cabaiguán bridge? Now?

01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:34.650
Yes. Now.

01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:38.570
How did it go?

01:30:39.170 --> 01:30:41.170
I couldn't collect the money.

01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:44.210
In Placetas, the police
are looking for me too.

01:30:44.370 --> 01:30:45.890
Rogelio!

01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:48.050
Take the compañeras back to camp.

01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:51.490
Wait a minute. With all due respect,

01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:56.010
I know these towns like the back
of my hand. Let me be your guide.

01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:57.810
I already have a guide.

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:13.050
Don't worry.
I know you're going to stay with us.

01:31:13.210 --> 01:31:16.930
Don't be like that. Calm down, girl.

01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:20.210
Don't worry.

01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:34.810
Do you know Cabaiguán?

01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:47.410
And tell Milián to have his people ready.

01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:49.330
We'll attack the garrison.

01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:51.290
Perfect.

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.130
Che.

01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:04.330
We have to give you a tetanus shot.

01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:09.490
No, it might trigger
an asthma attack.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.010
Give me some aspirin.

01:32:19.130 --> 01:32:21.730
Comandante, this is
the Virgin of Caridad del Cobre,

01:32:21.930 --> 01:32:24.490
the patron saint of Cuba,
to help your arrival in Havana.

01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:27.530
I hope it helps us arrive in Placetas.

01:32:27.690 --> 01:32:29.490
Goodbye!

01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:33.850
- How are you? Does it hurt?
- A little, but that's unavoidable.

01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:38.850
Here, for your arm.

01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:40.930
Thanks.

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:44.410
Long live the revolution!

01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:06.010
Shit, Argentine. You broke your paw?

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:08.890
- It's nothing. I fell off a roof.
- So, what happened?

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:12.130
- I just spoke to Fidel.
- And?

01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:14.490
Santiago has almost surrendered.

01:33:14.690 --> 01:33:17.090
Santa Clara is the only thing
standing between us and Havana.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.530
Batista's throwing everything
he's got to Santa Clara.

01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:22.170
That's why,

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:25.330
when you take Remedios
and I take Yaguajay,

01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:28.370
we can then take
Santa Clara together.

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:31.050
Give me a light.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.010
I know what I'm going to do
when we win this thing.

01:33:41.170 --> 01:33:42.690
I'll put you in a cage,

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:45.650
tour the country and charge admission.

01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.890
We'll be rich, man!

01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:57.010
What made you join the Movement?

01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:02.690
Well, I was in college when Fidel
attacked the Moncada Barracks.

01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:06.370
When I read his defense plea,
" History Will Absolve Me,"

01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:09.530
I knew he was the only one
who could take down Batista.

01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:13.370
And that he would do it fighting,
and I liked that.

01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:15.450
Does your family support you?

01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:17.050
Of course.

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:19.930
My cousin was killed.

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:25.810
The brutality of the army
intensified after the general strike.

01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:28.050
I think they got scared

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:31.490
when they saw
so many people against them.

01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:39.490
You don't look like a Communist.

01:34:40.210 --> 01:34:43.610
- And what do Communists look like?
- Well, not like you.

01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:45.610
We come in all colors.

01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:55.170
Do you expect to stay in Cuba
after the success of the revolution?

01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:58.130
My wife and my daughter are in Mexico.

01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:00.570
I have to keep them in mind.

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:03.010
Of course.

01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:09.610
I'm Lieutenant Pérez Valencia.

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.610
The rebel army

01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:14.090
is not what you have imagined.

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.890
Hand over your weapons
and no one will be injured.

01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:20.490
Stay on the air, over.

01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:23.010
Santa Clara hasn't sent reinforcements.

01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:25.490
It's a lost cause for these people.

01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:27.770
Attention, Che, attention.
Che, attention, Che.

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:32.050
Listen, could you resolve the problem
and follow the instructions,

01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:35.490
the instructions, the instructions
you gave me with the man I sent?

01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.850
So tell me if you understand, understand,
understand me. Over, Che.

01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:42.490
Camilo, I hear you perfectly.

01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:46.530
Your record is broken,
you have to change it. Over.

01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:50.810
How long will you be
in Yaguajay? Over.

01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:53.890
Three days, maybe a week. Over.

01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:56.370
The more time you stay there

01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:59.930
the harder it will be here,
Camilo. Over.

01:36:00.690 --> 01:36:04.250
Don't dare to enter the city
without me, do you hear?

01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:08.690
Camilo, it's fair to share
the glory sometimes. Over.

01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:12.490
Sharing the glory is fine,
but with an Argentine,

01:36:12.690 --> 01:36:14.850
don't do that to me.

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:17.330
Over and out, Che.

01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:36.690
It's good to have you
in Santa Clara, Colonel Casillas.

01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:40.370
The city's forces are at your disposal.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:44.010
Can those forces
get me some coffee?

01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:47.130
The best beans in the world, colonel.

01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:54.530
Sit down.

01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:44.170
Camilo Cienfuegos
wanted you to wait for him,

01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:45.690
but you kept going.

01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:47.570
Why?

01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:52.730
Santa Clara was all they had left,

01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:57.290
the only thing linking Havana
to the country as a whole.

01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:59.610
And though we had not slept for days

01:37:59.810 --> 01:38:02.530
and the army outnumbered us
nine to one,

01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:07.770
at that point, safely waiting for Camilo
seemed to us more dangerous.

01:38:08.650 --> 01:38:10.730
People of Santa Clara,

01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.890
this is Comandante Guevara speaking.

01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:17.610
The enemy wants us to live in fear,

01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:19.730
but it is they who should be afraid.

01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:25.650
The situation of the military regime
is getting worse every day,

01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:29.170
because their soldiers
don't want to fight.

01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:34.050
Santa Clara,

01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:40.050
if there has ever been a time
to fight for our freedom,

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:43.170
that time is now.

01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:46.210
That moment has come.

01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:04.330
I want air strikes

01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:07.530
all around the neighborhoods.

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:10.970
Torch those bastards!

01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:46.490
He's dead.

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:50.730
Cover him with that sheet.

01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:52.490
I need more help.

01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:54.370
- Aleida.
- The situation is critical.

01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:57.490
Talk to Camajuani
and ask for more doctors.

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.170
Yes?

01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:55.290
Comandante, it's Rogelio
calling from the station.

01:40:59.490 --> 01:41:00.530
Speak to me, Rogelio.

01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:04.930
Comandante, we took the train station.

01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:06.890
Is it safe?

01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:09.290
Good.

01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:14.370
Go with 15 men to the train tracks
between Toscano and San Pedro

01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:16.490
and wait there.

01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:18.090
All right.

01:42:18.370 --> 01:42:21.370
The tank is screwing us.
The machine gun doesn't let us get closer.

01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:22.730
For Guile and Ramiro.

01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:25.370
- What's the highest position?
- The church at the end of the street.

01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:27.810
Then you have to take the church,
you must take the church.

01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:29.570
Of course, Comandante.

01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:33.450
Go.

01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:46.810
Hit it hard.

01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:57.730
- How many houses do we have to cross?
- Five.

01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:01.330
Little Cowboy, it's too many.

01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:06.010
Hit it hard.
Fuck. We have to break it down now!

01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:21.170
Get down, Little Cowboy.
You're going to get hit.

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:44.530
Stay here.

01:45:29.770 --> 01:45:31.250
Aleida!

01:45:49.890 --> 01:45:52.890
- What the fuck are you doing?
- The SIM is on the hotel rooftop.

01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:55.850
They hit Little Cowboy.

01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:01.410
Tamayo. What happened?

01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:05.410
They got Little Cowboy, Comandante.

01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:07.010
What happened to him?

01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:10.010
We claimed a rooftop
to get a good position,

01:46:10.690 --> 01:46:14.770
and then he got shot in the head.
They killed him.

01:46:24.090 --> 01:46:25.930
Take him to the medical station.

01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:34.610
Tamayo.

01:46:35.130 --> 01:46:37.530
You are now in charge
of the suicide platoon.

01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:40.810
Keep breaking the walls
until you reach the church.

01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:42.570
They need to pay for this.

01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:56.010
The rebels have surrounded the city

01:46:56.210 --> 01:46:58.410
and our tanks can't cross the barricades.

01:46:59.290 --> 01:47:00.690
Shit.

01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:06.730
Get Havana on the phone.

01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:11.410
Tell them to airlift men
from Cienfuegos.

01:47:13.730 --> 01:47:16.690
We're going to secure this city
neighborhood by neighborhood

01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:18.930
and street by street.

01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:21.090
Send a battalion.

01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:38.290
Where are you going?

01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:41.770
I don't want to fight anymore.
I'm tired of this.

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:45.170
Let me go.

01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:54.490
Anyone else want to leave?

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:00.650
Cease fire!

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:03.490
Cease fire!

01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:24.930
Tell your men to put down their arms.

01:49:25.130 --> 01:49:27.650
I'm not going to negotiate
with a subordinate.

01:49:28.570 --> 01:49:30.530
You forgot to leave your gun.

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:34.250
- Give me that gun.
- Take your belt off.

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:40.370
I said I wouldn't negotiate
with a subordinate.

01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:43.970
That's okay. This isn't a negotiation.

01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:46.490
Comandante,

01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:49.530
I give you my word of honor that
if you let us return to Havana,

01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:51.970
we won't fire another shot.

01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:54.450
I believe your word of honor.

01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:58.890
But I can't let those bullets kill more
Cubans. Here or anywhere else.

01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:03.490
You have 15 minutes
to convince your men to surrender.

01:50:03.650 --> 01:50:08.010
If not, you will be responsible
for any bloodshed.

01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:17.250
Shit!

01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:23.610
Send this box to Camilo in Yaguajay.

01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:26.130
Aleida, come here.

01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:00.450
Call them on the telephone.

01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:07.330
We agree to a ceasefire
to get our dead and wounded.

01:51:14.290 --> 01:51:17.450
- I advise you to surrender.
- Over my dead body.

01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:21.730
What's wrong with you?
Where are you going?

01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:30.090
Your colonel wants you
to fight to the death.

01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:35.330
We don't want more Cubans to die.

01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:38.810
Give up your weapons

01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:41.610
and you will live.

01:51:46.770 --> 01:51:48.530
Turn in your weapons!

01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:50.970
Now!

01:52:09.010 --> 01:52:10.450
Well...

01:52:12.170 --> 01:52:14.250
The colonel and I

01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:18.930
are going on a special mission
to check our positions.

01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:23.650
Keep up the resistance
until I return, is that clear?

01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:25.810
Whatever you say, colonel.

01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:31.170
Shoot anyone who tries to leave.

01:52:45.370 --> 01:52:46.690
Who is this?

01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:49.730
That's Sánchez, the police captain.

01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:53.330
We found torture instruments
in the station.

01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:03.490
You know,
I have an idea to take the hotel.

01:53:04.890 --> 01:53:06.410
Tell me.

01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:08.170
Leave it to me.

01:54:16.170 --> 01:54:19.090
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
We surrender!

01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:21.770
Turn in your weapons!

01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:34.690
Come on, hurry up!

01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:54.890
Camilo took Yaguajay and he
and his troops are heading this way.

01:54:55.890 --> 01:54:58.170
We just heard the news
on the shortwave.

01:54:58.330 --> 01:55:00.890
It looks like Batista
abandoned the country.

01:55:02.970 --> 01:55:05.090
Yes, sir. Right now.

01:55:11.410 --> 01:55:14.530
It's General Cantillo
calling from Havana.

01:55:16.210 --> 01:55:17.770
Okay, leave.

01:55:19.810 --> 01:55:20.890
Yes, general?

01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:26.370
I'm negotiating
directly with the U.S. ambassador.

01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:31.210
I'm in command of the army now,
acting on behalf of Fidel Castro.

01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:35.690
I authorize you to negotiate a truce,
but not to surrender.

01:55:35.890 --> 01:55:39.170
You can't surrender
under any circumstances.

01:55:40.130 --> 01:55:42.090
As you say, general.

01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:47.530
Captain.

01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:49.570
I need to talk to Guevara.

01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:55.770
I've spoken to Fidel Castro. There's
been no deal with General Cantillo.

01:55:56.970 --> 01:56:00.210
This is a revolution, not a coup.

01:56:00.370 --> 01:56:05.810
It's either unconditional surrender
or we'll take the garrison by force.

01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:08.730
And you'll be responsible
for the bloodshed.

01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:13.330
Be aware of the possibility that
the U.S. government will intervene

01:56:13.530 --> 01:56:15.370
militarily in Cuba.

01:56:15.570 --> 01:56:19.490
If that happens,
it would be an even bigger crime,

01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:22.770
as you will be supporting
a foreign invasion.

01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:25.850
In that case, your only
remaining option would be

01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:29.370
for you to shoot yourself
for committing treason.

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:34.130
Mr. Guevara, I need to talk
with my superiors about that.

01:56:37.290 --> 01:56:39.610
It's 19 minutes past 10.

01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:45.170
At 11, I'll give the order to attack
using all our forces.

01:56:59.170 --> 01:57:03.050
- Sir, may I return home to my family?
- No.

01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:05.130
But we won the revolution already!

01:57:05.290 --> 01:57:08.970
We only won the war,
the revolution begins now.

01:57:15.130 --> 01:57:18.610
Get all your things,
we're leaving for Havana tomorrow.

01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:20.570
Aleida. You too.

01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:22.890
I'll need a guide.

01:57:23.050 --> 01:57:26.770
- But I don't know Havana very well.
- Neither do I.

01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:33.970
- This man wants to say hello to you.
- Thanks for all you've done for Cuba.

01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:38.290
Not me, all of them. All of them.

01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:45.050
Get ready.
We're leaving for Havana tomorrow.

01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:58.370
He told me he was heading to Havana
to participate in a military junta

01:57:58.570 --> 01:58:01.730
which was going to resolve
the problems of the Cuban people.

01:58:01.890 --> 01:58:05.970
I told him murderers like him weren't
going to resolve anything anymore.

01:58:06.450 --> 01:58:08.130
When I told him
I was bringing him to you,

01:58:08.290 --> 01:58:10.450
he pissed in his pants.

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:13.410
He begged me
to take him to another chief.

01:58:13.890 --> 01:58:15.570
What do you want me
to do with this guy?

01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:20.050
Keep him as a prisoner of war.
He will be judged by a tribunal.

01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:23.330
Comandante, place him
under special watch.

01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:25.010
Sure.

01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:30.370
- Son of a bitch.
- Bandit.

01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:32.530
I can't see anything,
then I turn around

01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:36.970
and I see Roberto in the jeep,
holding the grenade

01:58:37.170 --> 01:58:39.090
with the pin still in it.

01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:40.330
You're kidding.

01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:43.810
So he's looking at me, smiling,
like I'm stupid.

01:58:44.010 --> 01:58:46.850
But when he came out of the jeep,
I swear to you,

01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:48.850
he stood up,
acting like a tough guy,

01:58:49.050 --> 01:58:52.610
still holding the grenade in his hand,
just like this, boy.

01:58:52.770 --> 01:58:56.170
He could barely walk because
his knees were shaking so hard,

01:58:56.330 --> 01:59:01.050
and suddenly his eyes went up,

01:59:01.210 --> 01:59:05.970
and then he fainted with the grenade
in his hand with the pin still in it.

01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:08.970
Good one.

01:59:16.410 --> 01:59:18.250
Who has a light?

01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:20.330
Not me.

01:59:24.210 --> 01:59:26.090
Hey, this was mine!

01:59:30.690 --> 01:59:33.210
- Gentlemen.
- So, then?

01:59:33.370 --> 01:59:36.290
I'm going to the capital.
Thanks for everything.

01:59:36.490 --> 01:59:39.130
- See you in Havana.
- Of course.

01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:41.490
Ernesto.

01:59:51.330 --> 01:59:54.050
- Take care.
- Yes, Che.

01:59:54.210 --> 01:59:56.370
Don't worry, my man.

01:59:57.570 --> 02:00:00.490
Ultimately,
what we can say is that the revolution

02:00:00.690 --> 02:00:01.930
has moments of complete madness.

02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:06.010
The attack, for instance...

02:00:06.170 --> 02:00:09.330
The attack, for instance,
against the Moncada Garrison,

02:00:09.490 --> 02:00:11.850
the expedition of the Granma.

02:00:14.970 --> 02:00:17.970
The continuous struggle
of the small group of men

02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:19.690
that were left from that exp...

02:00:23.770 --> 02:00:28.370
The resistance against
those last attacks by the dictatorship

02:00:28.530 --> 02:00:30.850
in the Sierra Maestra.

02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:35.210
The invasion of Las Villas.

02:00:37.130 --> 02:00:40.970
The taking of the key cities in Cuba.

02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:45.730
If you analyze each one of those things,

02:00:48.650 --> 02:00:53.810
you come to the conclusion
that there was craziness involved.

02:00:57.890 --> 02:00:59.410
So, then?

02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:01.810
Are you coming with us?

02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:05.970
Yes. Under one condition.

02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:07.370
Which?

02:01:07.530 --> 02:01:09.530
When we're done in Cuba,

02:01:09.690 --> 02:01:12.730
you let me bring the revolution
to all Latin America.

02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:16.770
You, too, are a little crazy.

02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:24.970
It's a thing that I haven't seen
anybody doing.

02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:28.170
The rice is the most important thing,
if you take...

02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:34.610
Comandante,
do you need my services tonight?

02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:38.770
Son, you're killing me.

02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:42.450
Did I make you angry
with what I said the other night?

02:01:42.610 --> 02:01:46.290
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I was thinking.

02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:52.570
No, son, you are loved,
as they say in Cuba.

02:01:52.770 --> 02:01:55.450
- Thank you, Comandante.
- Do what you need to do.

02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:57.130
Good night.

02:01:59.650 --> 02:02:02.170
How does it feel to be a symbol?

02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:05.570
A symbol of what?
A symbol of the revolution.

02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:10.290
There is one thing I can tell you.

02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.810
We were very aware
that we represented the hopes

02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:17.930
of an unredeemed America.

02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:22.490
And all eyes, those of the oppressors
and those of the oppressed,

02:02:22.650 --> 02:02:24.330
were fixed upon us.

02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:30.170
In January of 1959, how old were you?

02:02:30.930 --> 02:02:33.370
I was 30 years old.

02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:40.610
See you in Havana!

02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:42.450
It's Rogelio.

02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:44.250
Tell him to stop.

02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:47.290
- What?
- Rogelio.

02:02:47.490 --> 02:02:48.770
Yes, tell him to stop.

02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:54.730
What are you doing with that car?

02:02:54.930 --> 02:02:56.370
I'm driving it to Havana.

02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:58.130
Who gave you authorization?

02:02:58.650 --> 02:03:02.450
I took it. It belonged
to one of the snipers, man.

02:03:02.610 --> 02:03:04.490
Don't "man" me, Rogelio.

02:03:04.650 --> 02:03:08.730
Even if it was Batista's,
this car isn't yours.

02:03:10.090 --> 02:03:13.810
Go back to Santa Clara immediately
and give it back.

02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:19.290
And then you will go to Havana
by bus, by jeep or on foot.

02:03:19.890 --> 02:03:22.970
I'd rather walk than drive to Havana
in a stolen car. Let's go.

02:03:47.210 --> 02:03:49.050
Unbelievable.
