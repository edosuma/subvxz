WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.671
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.907
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.247
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.892
*

00:29.563 --> 00:30.864
So, how was your date
last night?

00:30.898 --> 00:33.033
Ugh. Another guy
turned out to be gay.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.735
Are you still using
my Tinder account?

00:34.768 --> 00:37.238
I told you it's not like Hulu.
We can't share a subscription.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.408
Looks like Captain Dave
is late again.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.511
-Always does this.
-Then he waltzes in and says,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.446
"Sorry,
I'm on Captain Dave time."

00:45.479 --> 00:47.948
That's not a time zone;
it's a tragedy.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.184
-Oh, finally.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.153
Sorry, I'm on Captain Dave time.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.356
-Well, see you later.
-H-Hold on.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.524
Why are you holding a bag

00:56.557 --> 00:57.958
like someone who's never
held a bag before?

00:57.991 --> 00:59.293
DAVE:
All right.

00:59.327 --> 01:02.930
Truth is I've finally found
my Achilles' heel.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.032
It's my Achilles' wrist.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.368
-Ouch.
-Wait, it gets worse.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.870
-That's my high-fiving hand.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.206
I was walking down the street
and I saw some poor schlub

01:12.240 --> 01:14.108
trapped under a giant armoire.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.543
I knew my only two choices were

01:15.576 --> 01:17.044
to heroically lift
the thing off him

01:17.077 --> 01:19.147
or to cut his arm off
with my pocketknife.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.715
So I summoned up
all of my strength,

01:21.749 --> 01:24.452
but alas, my will was
stronger than my wrist.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.654
Anyway, the important thing
is I'm all patched up now

01:26.687 --> 01:29.157
-and ready to go.
-You can't fly.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.624
No, but until I can,
I'll have to settle for

01:30.658 --> 01:31.659
piloting a plane.
Let's do it.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.827
-Dave. -Oh, this is exactly why
I was hiding it.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.829
I knew you two were
gonna be dicks about this.

01:35.863 --> 01:36.997
Sorry, got to call it in.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.832
Come on, Bernie,
you can't ground this eagle.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.136
It needs to soar.
You know I can do this.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.538
All right. Let's give it a try.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.243
You know he's just calling in
a replacement, right?

01:49.277 --> 01:51.312
Yeah, I know.
Can you at least sign my cast?

01:51.345 --> 01:54.415
I have a date tonight and want
her to know I have friends.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.683
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.651
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.520
*

02:04.392 --> 02:05.826
WOMAN :
Attention all passengers,

02:05.859 --> 02:06.827
we are now boarding...

02:06.860 --> 02:08.829
Whoa, a bag!

02:08.862 --> 02:10.864
What's in them?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.766
Uh, just some toys.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.035
Toys. That's fun. Can I look?

02:15.068 --> 02:17.438
Um, I just... oh.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.474
There is many games.
You know what game I like?

02:20.508 --> 02:23.211
The one about the hippos
that are so very hungry.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.146
-Perhaps, not touch these.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.449
They're presents
for my son's birthday.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.783
Birthday? Fun.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.219
You know,
at my club Grapefruits,

02:31.252 --> 02:33.120
birthday boys get
half off lap dances.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.888
Dads pay full price
to watch, though.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.457
He's three.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.359
He is three
or he's turning three?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.329
I think I'm gonna go
through security again.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.565
Just... for fun.

02:44.598 --> 02:48.469
On my third birthday,
I dig hole for swimming pool.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.773
On my fourth birthday,
I find out it's mass grave.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.012
You know what?
You should tell him.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.249
-Bad news sounds better
coming from you. -Okay.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.885
So, Judases, did you find
my replacement?

03:04.918 --> 03:07.054
Ronnie?

03:07.087 --> 03:11.158
Yes, we did, but you are
not going to like it.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.660
What

03:12.693 --> 03:15.663
("Rock You Like a Hurricane"
by Scorpions playing)

03:15.696 --> 03:19.099
* Here I am *

03:19.132 --> 03:21.802
* Rock you like a hurricane *

03:23.771 --> 03:26.106
* Here I am. *

03:26.139 --> 03:27.775
Captain Steve.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.142
Captain Dave.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.382
Looks like I'll be taking over
the reins this weekend.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.616
Tough break on that wrist.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.950
I'd say, "No pun intended,"

03:36.984 --> 03:39.787
but I knew what I was doing.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.389
And this must be
my new flight crew.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.357
Good-looking pair.
You got names?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.359
-I'm Bernard.
-I'm Ronnie. Hi.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.261
Is it suddenly very hot in here?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.296
:
It is.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.630
Oh, hey, Dave,
didn't see you there.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.798
You just said hello to me.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.799
Heard about the divorce.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.367
How many is that for you

03:53.401 --> 03:55.235
Excuse me, try three.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.104
It seems no woman
could ever understand

03:57.137 --> 03:58.606
I'm married to the sky.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.908
-I'm married to a model.
-A catalog model.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.242
Internet catalog model.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.777
The whole future,
it's all online.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.112
-So true.
-Blogs.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.980
What are you even doing here?
You don't fly domestic.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.215
:
No.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.217
The international skies
are my playground.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.820
Then I got this call, and
I figured it'd be a great way

04:12.853 --> 04:15.289
to get back to my roots,
my American roots.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.824
God, I love this country.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.991
Well, I'll be back
in action any day,

04:18.025 --> 04:18.992
so don't get too comfortable.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.160
I'll try, but you know me,

04:20.193 --> 04:21.295
I'm comfortable anywhere.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.631
I exclusively use
public restrooms.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.071
Yeah. I'm always looking
for the next big thing.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.140
I mean, landing on water,
it's been done.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.842
Sully did it.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.612
So I was thinking, what's the
next thing we should land on?

04:38.646 --> 04:42.149
I say... the sky.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.851
I have no idea what that means,

04:43.884 --> 04:47.020
-but I like how close
I feel to you.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.757
-Hey, fellas.
-Captain Dave.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.492
How are things going
in my cockpit?

04:51.525 --> 04:53.327
Great. Captain Steve
let me wear his jacket.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.862
Look how floppy my arms are.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.597
Shouldn't you be at home
resting up that wrist?

04:56.630 --> 04:59.767
Not that I'd know--
I've never broken anything.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.036
-Except a few hearts.
I can believe it.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.205
I thought I should fly with you
this weekend, you know,

05:05.238 --> 05:07.174
in case you had
any questions or you died.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.710
I'll just third-wheel it
in the jump seat.

05:09.743 --> 05:13.447
Oh. Yeah. Sorry, the jump seat's
occupied by my copilot.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.717
A 200

05:16.750 --> 05:18.386
Great. That's embarrassing.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.721
Now everybody knows
how much I lift!

05:20.754 --> 05:22.956
Anyway,
you can fly with us,

05:22.990 --> 05:25.726
-but you're gonna have to ride
in the cabin.

05:25.759 --> 05:29.229
You want me to sit
in that flying refugee camp?

05:31.932 --> 05:35.268
They made these tickets
way too cheap.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.973
-Right there.
-COLIN: I'm so sorry,

05:40.007 --> 05:41.475
those seats are taken.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.844
Maybe just find two other seats?

05:43.877 --> 05:46.680
Yeah, okay. Ah, sorry.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.252
-Your pants are on fire.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.921
Oh, my God,
you just lied to them.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.989
Well, yeah, clearly.
They're both very shady.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.591
And also,
I'm kind of preoccupied

05:57.625 --> 05:59.693
with finalizing
my son's birthday party.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.094
He's turning three.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.096
Oh. That's a cute age...

06:03.130 --> 06:04.865
is something people say, right?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.734
I don't know anything
about kids.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.102
It's his first birthday since
his mother and I separated,

06:09.136 --> 06:10.904
and I think
I've rather outdone myself.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.607
Check out the play gym
I've booked.

06:13.641 --> 06:18.111
Now, there's a puppy playpen, a
cake pit, and all the princesses

06:18.145 --> 06:20.848
are actual descendants
of exiled royalty.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.451
Wow, that sounds a lot better
than my third birthday party.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.785
God, what a disaster.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.119
You remember
your third birthday?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.588
Only 'cause my mom taped it.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.423
Then the tape was later used
in the trial.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.659
It was also the first time
I smoked Marlboro Red.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.462
My family was a little trashy.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.263
I grew up near Bakersfield.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.499
Our town mayor
was a Harley-Davidson.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.875
Sleep when you're on the ground.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.943
You're in the air,
for God's sake.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.779
Show some respect.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.081
Are you seriously gonna fly
back and forth all weekend

06:54.114 --> 06:55.649
just to keep an eye on him?

06:55.683 --> 06:58.385
-Yes. Don't.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.521
-You don't know.

07:05.693 --> 07:09.830
If it's off, it's too hot.
If it's on, it dries my eyes.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.866
You people live like animals!

07:16.470 --> 07:18.772
DAVE: Thanks for all your help
with Captain Steve.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.841
-I couldn't help it.

07:20.874 --> 07:24.011
I'm very single, and that
silver fox has a strong back

07:24.044 --> 07:25.979
and could probably carry me
across a river.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.116
Be a modern woman and carry
yourself across a river, Ronnie.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.151
I don't understand.
What is your problem with him?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.153
He thinks he's
so much better than me

07:33.186 --> 07:35.355
just because he finished first
in our flight class,

07:35.388 --> 07:37.324
and beat me out
for the international route,

07:37.357 --> 07:40.861
and won Jackpot's Sexiest Pilot
award six years in a row,

07:40.894 --> 07:44.164
despite me killing it
in the talent category.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.670
Oh, Dave. Nobody wanted to see
your Magic Mike routine.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.305
Yeah, that was all Mike
and no magic.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.041
This was the one place
where I didn't feel

07:54.074 --> 07:55.509
like I was in
Captain Steve's shadow.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.611
Well, I'm not letting him
take that from me, too.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.313
I can fly this plane,
and I'll prove it.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.982
How many push-ups
you want to see me do?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.450
-600.
-None.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.119
One!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.788
:
Okay.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.890
I can't do a push-up,
but my wrist is fine.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.458
It can do everything
it used to do.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.194
I can do the Dirty Dancing lift.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.997
Bernard, run to me!

08:18.331 --> 08:19.466
No.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.769
Dave, go home. Get some rest.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.341
Nobody puts Bernard in a corner.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.844
STEVE:
Welcome to Las Vegas.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.915
-Hi. Thank you.
-Hi.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.751
Oh, that landing touched me.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.721
Did we land? I didn't feel
the wheels touch the ground.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.557
I know. Usually, I have to
take pills to feel this way.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.926
And don't forget
who gave you those pills.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.932
So, what'd you think
of the L.A. to Vegas flight?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.701
Pretty boring, right?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.669
You should probably get back
to your old route now.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.370
Actually, it was
kind of a nice break

08:57.404 --> 08:59.406
from the spotlight
of the international route.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.909
I've already conquered that.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.777
It's probably time
to conquer something new.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.379
Like when Nicole Kidman does TV.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.315
Yeah.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.920
I could see myself
doing this full-time.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.724
Captain Steve is
moving into my route.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.558
We got to do something
to stop him.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.595
-I don't know. Something!

09:21.629 --> 09:23.263
The alternative
is he replaces me.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.432
We can't let that happen.
We're a team.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.967
Think about all our history.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.268
Your first week on the job,

09:28.301 --> 09:29.937
when you forgot to lock
the exit door,

09:29.970 --> 09:31.805
who blamed the ground crew
and got that guy fired?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.206
Yeah, but I felt
so guilty afterwards,

09:33.240 --> 09:34.742
I had to date him
for six months.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.877
So I got you laid, too.
And, Bernie,

09:36.910 --> 09:38.478
we've been together for years.
We're like brothers.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.747
You came out to me.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.581
Uh, no.
You just flat-out asked.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.717
Your exact words were,
"Gay, right?"

09:43.751 --> 09:46.286
The point is
that we look out for each other.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.922
That's why you got to help me.
You got to help me.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.758
What do you think?

09:50.791 --> 09:53.126
Well, right now,
all I can think about

09:53.160 --> 09:55.262
is how good
Captain Steve smells.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.898
Does anyone know what that is?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.567
It's a pamplemousse
facial scrub.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.170
Not available in the States.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.275
Don't get me wrong,
I want to help Dave, I do.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.477
But would it really be
the worst thing in the world

10:10.510 --> 10:12.112
if Steve was our new boss?

10:12.145 --> 10:14.447
It's probably less work for us.
We wouldn't have to babysit.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.583
I mean, he's actually got
a life off the plane.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.451
Yeah, he doesn't want
to waste time with us.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.520
He's got a catalog model
to go home to.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.989
He just clocks in, clocks out.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.157
Imagine working for a pilot
who says "thank you"

10:24.191 --> 10:26.326
every once in a while,
and doesn't make us check

10:26.359 --> 10:28.095
his hair for grays
before each flight.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.364
What are you complaining about?
You only have to check his head.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.336
Colin?

10:36.369 --> 10:38.772
COLIN: Oh, thank God
you answered. Ronnie,

10:38.806 --> 10:40.207
it's all coming apart.
The universe

10:40.240 --> 10:41.875
is getting back at me
for my hubris.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.444
I had a petard,
and I've been hoisted by it.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.645
Colin, you're using
high-scoring Scrabble words.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.214
I don't know what you're saying.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.717
I'm talking about the play gym
I booked for my son's party.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.451
It's been shut down.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.887
An anti-vaxxer held a party,
I don't know,

10:53.921 --> 10:55.889
something about
a long-dormant supervirus.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.657
It's a disaster.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.660
-Okay, just calm down.
-I can't calm down.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.996
I'm holding a party tomorrow
for 24 children.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.298
I've got nowhere to throw it.
I need help.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.900
I know it's weird
I'm calling you.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.902
You're the only person
I know in Las Vegas.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.671
Well, not the only person.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.242
Hey!

11:15.275 --> 11:17.577
Ronnie says you need help
throwing party

11:17.610 --> 11:19.212
to buy your son's love.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.981
-Yeah.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.384
And Artem is big helper.
Hop in. I have candy.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.587
Oh, no. You want me
to get in this

11:27.620 --> 11:30.623
Yeah, don't worry,
it's not even my van.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.195
Let's just say, for a minute,
we actually considered

11:35.228 --> 11:37.697
lodging a fake complaint
against Captain Steve.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.333
What could we possibly say
that would make a difference?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.735
We'll just say
he grabbed my ass.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.937
Um, if he's grabbing
anybody's ass, it's mine.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.939
Please.
Have you seen your ass?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.274
Because I haven't.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.843
-He's not even gay.
-I transcend sexuality.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.678
Do you know
how many pilots I've turned?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.847
-You'd be surprised.

11:53.881 --> 11:57.684
The drink carts aren't the
only things that go both ways.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.352
Um, sorry to interrupt,

11:59.386 --> 12:02.455
but don't you think
you guys should be working?

12:03.991 --> 12:06.526
It's the Saturday afternoon
flight from Vegas to L.A.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.929
-There's nothing to do.
-Yeah.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.731
See, it's that attitude
that makes you both

12:11.765 --> 12:13.767
such remarkable failures.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.404
I demand excellence every moment
you're on this plane.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.572
Right, but, Steve,
there's literally...

12:19.606 --> 12:22.876
Uh, sorry. "Steve"?
Try "Captain," or "sir."

12:22.910 --> 12:27.280
I don't know how you got away
with this garbage before, but...

12:27.314 --> 12:29.950
it ends now.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.885
Can you believe that?

12:31.919 --> 12:33.320
Who the hell
does he think he is?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.922
I'm gonna march
right into that cockpit

12:34.955 --> 12:36.456
and make him grab my ass.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.295
COLIN:
Wow.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.730
This place is really impressive.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.432
Yeah, business is good,
eh, Farley?

12:45.465 --> 12:48.335
Yeah, man, things have blown up
for us, ever since

12:48.368 --> 12:52.405
that Stranger Things kid nailed
a paparazzo with his scooter.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.242
Follow me.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.445
So you need something
for tomorrow morning, 20 heads.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.013
What's the chick

13:00.047 --> 13:02.315
-Girl to guy. Girl to guy ratio.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.616
We like to keep it three to one.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.152
Oh, I-I think it's about even.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.653
Oof, you're lucky
Artem's a friend.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.923
So, tomorrow is going to be lit!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.591
Egypt Keys-Beatz is hosting.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.495
Bottle service only. Let's say,
uh, ten of the magnums?

13:15.528 --> 13:18.999
Also, you're gonna want
the table out by the ball pit.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.301
-That's where it all goes down.
-Okay.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.104
Uh, what is that

13:24.137 --> 13:27.107
Peanut allergy.
So, with the bottles, the table,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.509
and of course the party
favors...

13:29.542 --> 13:32.112
Why is he winking?
We really do need party favors.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.282
Your total comes out to $8,000.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.850
-That is good price.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.286
No, no, no, no. There's no way
I can afford that.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.655
Look, I want this to be special
for my son, but I'm on a budget.

13:42.689 --> 13:46.059
What can I get for $400?

13:46.093 --> 13:49.963
I paid $400 to get back
to exactly where I started.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.199
Welcome to Las Vegas!

14:00.540 --> 14:03.376
Oh, we have to do something
about Captain Steve.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.512
But first, which one of us
is more sexually harass

14:05.545 --> 14:08.215
Before you answer,
consider my bedroom eyes.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.017
Relax. Don't pop a contact.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.885
Steve is going
to make our lives hell

14:11.919 --> 14:14.321
if he takes over this route.
We have to stop him.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.655
We're thinking smear campaign.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.157
Same thing we did
with Klepto-Kathy,

14:17.190 --> 14:18.992
although we may have
jumped the gun on that one.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.393
Well, just because
we found my bracelet

14:20.427 --> 14:22.095
doesn't mean she didn't
want to steal it.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.164
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's slow down here.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.200
We can't just go around
besmirching Steve's reputation.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.602
What? This was your idea.
Where is this coming from?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.238
And when did you learn
"besmirch"?

14:31.271 --> 14:33.073
All I'm saying, we should
consider our options

14:33.106 --> 14:34.674
before crucifying him.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.276
Corporate said
Dave could have Steve's route

14:36.309 --> 14:38.178
-if Steve took Dave's route.
-Damn it, Alan.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.679
-All right.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.048
I called corporate to ask,
hypothetically,

14:41.081 --> 14:42.916
if Captain Steve took
L.A. to Vegas,

14:42.950 --> 14:45.218
could I take international,
and they were on board.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.055
So when it was your job on
the line, you needed our help,

14:48.088 --> 14:49.589
but now that it's ours,

14:49.622 --> 14:51.124
-you don't care.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.793
This international route
would be huge for me.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.362
I need this.
Just look at me.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.629
Look at my wrist.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.798
We're supposed to be cool
with you screwing us,

14:58.831 --> 15:02.202
-just because you couldn't help
some guy under an armoire? -No.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.204
You should be cool with it
because I was the guy

15:04.237 --> 15:05.472
under the armoire.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.474
I was the one I couldn't help.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.910
I bought it.
And I was moving it back

15:10.944 --> 15:13.113
to my place
when it tipped over on me.

15:13.146 --> 15:16.149
I was trapped
underneath of it for hours.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.718
Hours. When I picked it up
from that Craigslist perv,

15:18.751 --> 15:20.820
he even said to me,
"Don't you have someone

15:20.853 --> 15:22.755
to help you move this?"
But I didn't.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.225
Because the truth is
I have no one in my life

15:25.258 --> 15:28.962
to help me move a gorgeous piece
of antique furniture.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.331
So am I being
a little selfish?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.566
Yes.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.238
But when you're a guy
stuck moving armoires alone...

15:38.271 --> 15:40.440
you get to be selfish.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.511
What's a armoire?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.146
What are we doing here?

15:46.179 --> 15:48.248
We still haven't found
a place for the party.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.749
We'll find place.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.086
For now, we focus
on entertainment.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.622
COLIN: You think this is
the place for the entertainment?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.125
-Yeah.
-I... O-Okay.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.292
* I like your body, girl *

15:59.326 --> 16:01.328
* Seen you up in
this party, girl *

16:01.361 --> 16:02.462
* The way you move
is hypnotic... *

16:02.495 --> 16:03.930
-Hi!
-Mm!

16:03.963 --> 16:06.433
It's so fun
when my friends come by.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.302
My family almost never comes
to visit me at work.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.670
I'm sorry,
did you say "almost never"?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.672
And don't worry,
you came to the right place.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.141
We have so many talented ladies

16:14.174 --> 16:15.775
who want to help
with this party.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.444
Girls?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.312
-MAN: Next to the stage...
-This is Staci.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.714
She makes awesome
balloon animals out of condoms.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.450
COLIN:
Yeah. Oh. Ah.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.285
: That's disgusting.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.819
This is Juli.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.221
She has an amazing
singing voice.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.790
She actually came here
to be in one of the shows,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.526
but, well, life is hard,
so she's here now.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.162
Okay.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.797
And this is Micki.
She's, like, an animal trainer.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.667
Her dog can do
the craziest tricks. Watch.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.135
Shake.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.671
-Pleasure.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.906
We will take the balloon animals
and the singer.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.676
Thank you, Mr. Dog, I think
we're gonna go another way.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.145
You see? One problem solved.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.314
Now we just have to find
birthday house.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.217
-Wait, you still don't have a
place for the party? -COLIN: No.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.486
So the possibility
of ruining my son's childhood

16:59.519 --> 17:01.154
-is still very much in play.
-Yeah.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.822
DOG:
Hey, man, don't sweat it.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.757
My dad ruined
all my birthdays growing up,

17:04.791 --> 17:06.526
and I turned out just fine.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.994
Oh, dear God.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.197
If you guys are
still looking for a venue,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.031
I might know a place.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.744
I still can't believe
how well this all came together.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.747
And they were okay with shutting
down the strip club for this?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.549
Oh, yeah, no,
Sundays are slow anyway.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.251
You know, actually,
it's really nice

17:31.284 --> 17:33.553
to have customers on our laps
for a change.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.123
My giraffe is slippery.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.057
-Oh, oh, uh, uh...

17:38.091 --> 17:40.560
Thank you both so much
for all of this.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.195
I suppose I'm not used to people

17:42.229 --> 17:44.397
going out of their way
like this for me.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.366
Well, of course.
We're friends.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.237
Yeah. After all our flights
together, we like to think, uh,

17:50.270 --> 17:52.572
that you're one of us now.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.442
That's really nice.
I think.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.910
Daddy, we're going
to the sparkly cider room!

17:57.944 --> 17:59.279
Oh.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.417
STEVE:
Hello, passengers.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.952
This is Captain Steve.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.255
As we're approaching Vegas,
a little reminder.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.323
If it's magic
you're looking for,

18:10.357 --> 18:13.326
head over to Caesars
for Pascal the Magnificent.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.563
I've seen him myself,
and let me tell you,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.098
the only thing
that man can't make disappear

18:19.132 --> 18:21.434
is the smile on your face.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.336
Boned his wife.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.472
I'm gonna get a cup of joe.
You want anything?

18:25.505 --> 18:28.908
-I'll have one, too.
-Get it yourself.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.312
Oh. Captain Dave.
Something I can help you with?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.113
Yeah, I wanted to ask you
to take it easier

18:34.147 --> 18:36.115
-on Ronnie and Bernard.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.485
You mean those flat-ass soda
machines with bad attitudes?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.253
I don't know why
you're even defending them.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.155
They're just a couple of losers
who should be grateful

18:42.189 --> 18:43.956
to have a job at all--
in fact, frankly,

18:43.990 --> 18:45.558
if it was up to me,
they wouldn't.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.635
Those are my friends
you're talking about.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.604
And I don't care
what it costs me,

18:57.637 --> 18:59.639
you will never take over
this flight.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.041
What? You...
Take over this flight?

19:02.074 --> 19:03.510
Why the hell would...?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.212
:
Oh. This is pathetic.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.680
Did you think that I wanted
to trade routes with you?

19:07.714 --> 19:10.483
Well, it crossed my...
No. I mean, a little.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.653
I was never serious about taking
over this godforsaken flight.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.456
I mean, come on, Dave, look
at me-- I fly international.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.225
Okay, stop calling it
international, Steve.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.193
And let's call it what it is.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.196
-It's Canada. -Well, it counts.
They have their own money.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.664
That doesn't even fit
in wallets.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.666
It fits in wallets.
You just have to fold the bill!

19:26.699 --> 19:28.668
!
-My problem right now

19:28.701 --> 19:30.570
is I'm talking
to an overrated hack

19:30.603 --> 19:32.138
whose stickwork is pedestrian.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.806
-I said,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.875
I've seen groundos
with better air feel than you.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.844
You take that back,
you son of a bitch.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.146
Why don't you make me?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.014
-Ow! Aah!

19:42.048 --> 19:43.816
What is your face made of?!

19:43.850 --> 19:45.752
You punched him!

19:45.785 --> 19:48.488
Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.924
How is this amazing?
He hit me in the face.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.694
That's good, too,
but, I mean, he's screwed now.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.095
It's nothing;
it's just a little scrape

19:56.128 --> 19:58.398
-between a couple of pilots.
-But he's not a pilot.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.934
You made him sit in the cabin.
You just assaulted a passenger.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.903
Boom, bitch.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.240
RONNIE:
Ooh.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.848
-That was... that was weird
when you did that. -No.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.884
-It was weird.
-Ronald!

20:19.386 --> 20:22.255
Look. Colin gave us
socialist gift bags.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.257
Wow. Looks like you had
a fun weekend.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.192
COLIN:
Oh, you mean the T

20:26.225 --> 20:28.795
Yeah, well, they're party favors
from my son's birthday.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.131
He said it was the best party
he'd ever had.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.234
He's also insisted
I buy him the Kidz Bop version

20:35.268 --> 20:36.769
of "Turn Down for What."

20:36.803 --> 20:39.205
I'll see you all in hell!

20:39.238 --> 20:42.609
Seems like you had a pretty
interesting weekend yourself.

20:42.642 --> 20:46.145
Nah. Pretty much the yuje.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.753
Hey. Um...
I wanted to thank you

20:53.786 --> 20:55.922
for sticking up
for us back there,

20:55.955 --> 20:58.725
even if it meant losing out
on the international job.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.894
Eh, it was nothing.
We're a team, right?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.496
Damn right we are.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.965
Which reminds me,
I have something for you.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.967
It's my phone number.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.602
Just in case
you ever need someone

21:09.636 --> 21:11.671
-to help you move an armoire.
-Thanks.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.973
I actually took your number
off the crew list a while ago.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.176
-Creepy. -As a symbolic gesture,
though, this is very nice.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.845
And the good news is,
since Captain Steve has

21:18.878 --> 21:21.147
a broken hand, looks like I'll
be the one flying back to L.A.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.583
No, no, not so fast, cowboy.
You still have a broken wrist.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.785
Bernard called in
another replacement.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.989
Well, whoever it is, they can't
be any worse than Captain Steve.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.959
("Rock You Like a Hurricane"
by Scorpions playing)

21:37.063 --> 21:38.631
* Here I am... *

21:38.665 --> 21:40.800
-Captain Carl.
-Hi.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.702
How are you?

21:44.036 --> 21:47.674
-Oh, damn it.
-* Here I am. *

You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.519
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.390
It's time we fly
this old bird.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.359
* It feels good *

22:06.393 --> 22:09.295
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.062
I can help you.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.064
* It feels good *

22:12.098 --> 22:13.700
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

22:13.733 --> 22:15.067
No, you never
touch this.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.869
* You know it feels good *

22:16.903 --> 22:18.505
-* It feels good *

22:18.538 --> 22:20.473
* Oh, you know it feels good *

22:20.507 --> 22:22.542
Let's do it.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.877
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

22:28.014 --> 22:28.915
Unbelievable.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.550
* It feels good *
