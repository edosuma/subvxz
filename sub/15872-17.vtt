00:01.667 --> 00:04.458
[Emma]  A few months ago
I discovered I had
a twin sister

00:04.458 --> 00:07.250
and then she asked me
to take her place.

00:07.250 --> 00:10.959
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.708 --> 00:13.500
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.583
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:17.834 --> 00:19.208
Derek's dead.
They think I did it.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
We can't make the switch.
Get out!

00:23.000 --> 00:24.917
-No, I'm coming with you!
-Just go!

00:25.542 --> 00:26.375
[tires screeching]

00:27.625 --> 00:29.667
[Sutton]  That man is...

00:29.667 --> 00:31.333
[Ethan]  My father.

00:31.333 --> 00:34.208
It's true, I never believe
Ethan, but this time I do.
I think he was set up.

00:34.208 --> 00:37.000
You're the last person
my mom or dad wants me
dating right now,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
so we continue
to sneak around and lie.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.375
[inaudible]

00:42.208 --> 00:45.000
-I came back for you.
-You got me.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.625
The closer I get to her,
the safer your secret is.
Come on.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.834
[Mads]  Ryan told me
that you came onto him
at the Black and White Ball.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.917
Sutton might have done those
things to you, but I didn't!

00:53.917 --> 00:55.417
What are you talking about?

00:55.417 --> 00:57.542
I'm not Sutton Mercer.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.417
I am Emma Becker,
her twin sister.

01:01.542 --> 01:04.166
Uh, this is
so completely insane.

01:05.708 --> 01:08.792
You, Sutton,
the two of you twins?

01:08.792 --> 01:10.375
And her parents and Laurel,
none of them have a clue?

01:10.917 --> 01:12.375
Um, plenty of clues.

01:12.375 --> 01:13.667
[chuckles]

01:13.667 --> 01:15.458
Luckily,
they just kind of like

01:15.458 --> 01:17.208
the new Sutton, I guess.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.083
I wanted to tell you
probably the most.

01:19.083 --> 01:20.750
I almost did, but...

01:20.750 --> 01:23.375
This explains so much.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.875
I think. I mean,

01:26.875 --> 01:28.667
when I thought
that you had slept
with Thayer--

01:28.667 --> 01:31.333
-[Thayer] No, No.
-No, that was Sutton.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.583
And the secret boyfriend
Ethan?

01:32.583 --> 01:33.708
Her

01:33.708 --> 01:35.041
and me.

01:35.041 --> 01:36.750
And me pretending to be her.

01:36.750 --> 01:37.750
And Ryan?

01:37.750 --> 01:39.917
Me. Her.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.792
Uh, her again. She...

01:41.792 --> 01:44.708
She was the one
that came onto him.

01:44.708 --> 01:48.375
But this is so cool.
You really are amazing, Emma.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.208
Uh, we try not to say
that name aloud.

01:50.208 --> 01:51.333
Yeah.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.917
Okay, so back to Ethan.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.083
Whose boyfriend is he now?

01:54.083 --> 01:55.625
He's mine.

01:55.625 --> 01:59.208
Unfortunately, Sutton
is with him right now.

01:59.208 --> 02:02.625
I have no idea where.

02:02.625 --> 02:05.041
And she's still, like...

02:05.041 --> 02:06.166
Yeah.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.917
Uh... But I trust Ethan.

02:14.458 --> 02:15.708
What?

02:15.708 --> 02:17.792
No, I mean, that's great.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.208
Uh, I'm just wondering
if you could trust Sutton.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.250
[door opens]

02:30.083 --> 02:31.708
Still don't pick up
after yourself.

02:32.542 --> 02:33.708
Nothing's changed.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.417
No, sure hasn't.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.333
I'll tell you what.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.959
Why don't we just

02:38.959 --> 02:40.834
try to keep out
of each other's way
until you leave?

02:41.667 --> 02:42.959
A week, remember?

02:42.959 --> 02:44.500
Yeah, I remember.

02:51.458 --> 02:53.542
[sighs]
Thought she wasn't
your girlfriend.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.000
She was a different person
back then.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.917
And now?

02:57.917 --> 02:59.625
Now there's a side of her
I don't trust.

02:59.625 --> 03:02.333
Well, trust her or not,

03:03.542 --> 03:04.708
make sure you get her
an extra blanket.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.000
It's gonna be
a cold one tonight.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.291
Hey, Sutton.

03:17.291 --> 03:18.333
Oh.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.667
Sorry.
Brought you a blanket.

03:21.667 --> 03:22.875
Thanks.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.708
Actually, I was thinking
you can sleep in here tonight.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.542
I will take the couch
in the living room.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.792
I wanted to thank you
for what you said,

03:36.792 --> 03:38.417
earlier, about my mom.

03:39.834 --> 03:40.750
Don't mention it.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.375
Okay. You keep the bed.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.417
I don't mind
sleeping on the couch.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.250
Ethan...

03:53.250 --> 03:54.333
Thanks for the blanket.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.083
Yeah.

[siren wailing]

04:31.417 --> 04:33.250
What can I do for you, Alec?

04:33.250 --> 04:35.875
Straight to the point,
no pleasantries.
I like that, Dan.

04:35.875 --> 04:36.834
We're investigating
a murder right now

04:36.834 --> 04:38.500
and I'm knee-deep in it, so...

04:38.500 --> 04:39.917
Don't you think
you ought to be knee-deep

04:39.917 --> 04:42.166
in trying to find
your fugitive brother?

04:42.166 --> 04:44.125
He's still only a suspect.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.708
My office thinks
he's the prime suspect, Dan.

04:47.917 --> 04:50.208
You're looking
for an alternate suspect?

04:50.208 --> 04:52.708
In legal circles, we call that
a conflict of interest.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.834
Shouldn't it be
in both our interests

04:54.834 --> 04:56.291
to find the real killer?

04:56.291 --> 04:57.667
Danny, it's my strong belief

04:57.667 --> 04:58.667
that your brother
is the real killer.

04:59.625 --> 05:03.834
Your top priority,
your only priority,

05:03.834 --> 05:05.291
is finding Ethan.

05:05.291 --> 05:06.625
I only take orders
from my chief.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.250
Not always.

05:09.375 --> 05:10.417
We have an arrangement.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.917
Uh, speaking of
that arrangement,

05:12.917 --> 05:14.834
I don't know,
call me curious, but,

05:15.792 --> 05:17.208
when exactly does that end?

05:20.291 --> 05:21.542
I'm going through
a tunnel, Dan.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.458
You find your brother.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.333
Then we'll talk.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.166
[cell phone beeps]

05:35.375 --> 05:36.834
Your dad has a friend.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.333
That's Angie.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.291
She comes here every year
to buy horses.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.208
She's got a barn
on the other side
of the county.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.750
Mmm. She's pretty.

05:45.750 --> 05:46.708
Is there a history there?

05:48.667 --> 05:51.750
Well, she's always had
a thing for my dad

05:51.750 --> 05:53.000
and he's never
been interested.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.583
Is that what
you call a history?

05:56.625 --> 05:57.500
[chuckles]

05:59.083 --> 06:00.208
Check out that body language.

there was a history.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.250
"you're so rugged
and handsome."

06:09.250 --> 06:11.708
And he'd be saying, uh...

06:11.708 --> 06:13.542
"No offense, but are you

06:13.542 --> 06:14.875
"gonna buy a horse or not?"

to clip my toenails."

buy a horse,

try again next year."

[laughs]

06:49.708 --> 06:52.208
Look, it's not even my case,

06:52.208 --> 06:54.667
but even if it was
how could you expect me
to tell you anything?

06:54.667 --> 06:56.834
-I just wanna help.
-Really? You wanna help?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.291
This whole thing
is nothing but dead ends.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.083
Derek's original arrest,

07:01.083 --> 07:03.250
the college kid
that he was dealing to,

07:03.250 --> 07:05.500
it all goes nowhere.
So what do you think
that you can add to this?

07:07.166 --> 07:09.041
I just want to tell you
that that night with Ethan,
it wasn't--

07:09.041 --> 07:10.667
I know, I know. It's okay.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.250
I know he didn't kill Derek.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.125
But it doesn't matter

07:16.125 --> 07:18.917
because Alec is all over
my ass, thinking that he did.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.125
I know he's...
He's your godfather,

07:21.125 --> 07:23.250
and your father,
I... I understand that.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.875
But he's also the DA,
therefore, my boss,

07:25.875 --> 07:28.041
and he wants Ethan home,
and he wants him home
right now.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.417
It's like some sort of
obsession he has with it.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.458
I know you miss Ethan,
we all do.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.875
But wherever he is right now,

07:34.875 --> 07:35.917
he's safer there
than here, trust me.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.625
[Mads] You didn't say
anything because you think

07:41.625 --> 07:42.959
our dad might be involved?

07:42.959 --> 07:45.041
Because we don't know
who we can trust.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.333
Everybody seems connected now.

07:48.417 --> 07:49.458
So, what do we do?

07:53.417 --> 07:54.333
Emma?

07:57.250 --> 07:59.458
[Emma] What about that
college guy Dan said Derek
was arrested with?

07:59.458 --> 08:01.000
The one he
was dealing drugs to?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.291
Maybe he knows something.

08:02.291 --> 08:03.333
Okay,
I'll see what I can find.

Not quite ready
for boyfriend consumption.

[inhales deeply]

08:19.417 --> 08:20.708
Well, you want
to take a break?

08:21.500 --> 08:22.458
Maybe later.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.083
I should really
finish this song.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.000
You sure I can't help you?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.875
Yeah, it's not ready. So...

08:28.875 --> 08:29.708
I'll figure it out.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.959
With Baz, right?

08:37.667 --> 08:39.750
[sighs] Oh, crap,

Rebecca knows my parents.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.583
If she sees us together,

08:42.583 --> 08:43.667
she might say something.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.792
My cue to go.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.667
-Hey, Laurel.
-Hi.

08:50.667 --> 08:51.917
Just the girl I wanted to see.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.250
I have some exciting news.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.917
Guess who's coming to town.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.917
Uh, Coldplay, and you've got
front row tickets?

08:57.917 --> 08:59.250
No, better.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.917
Ray Morgan, the best producer
in the business.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.625
And guess what.
He has agreed to produce
a demo for you guys.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.792
Okay, what is this? Christmas?

09:08.792 --> 09:10.667
Because that sounds fantastic.

09:10.667 --> 09:13.083
Yes, and you can
even bring that cute boy
you were talking to.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.583
Yeah, please don't say
anything to my parents.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.750
They can't know
I'm seeing him.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.458
A secret relationship?

09:25.458 --> 09:26.875
No, it's not--

09:26.875 --> 09:28.583
I love that.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.291
I mean, maybe. It's just,
it's a really long story.

09:31.291 --> 09:33.041
Okay, well, let me sit down.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.750
Let's talk about it.
Tell me everything.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.917
Okay. Um...

09:44.250 --> 09:46.208
Really appreciate
the invitation, Ben.

09:46.208 --> 09:48.458
Well, I mean, I know it was
probably the kids' idea.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.792
Right on the first guess.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.917
Well, I have an idea.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.750
I think it's time
for a little icebreaker.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.500
I'm gonna ask a question,

10:05.500 --> 10:07.083
and then we all have
to go around answering it.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.917
Um...

10:09.917 --> 10:10.834
Mmm.

10:11.834 --> 10:14.291
What famous person,
dead or alive,

10:14.291 --> 10:16.125
would you want to meet?
I love this one.

10:23.959 --> 10:25.667
Okay, I'll go first.

with a horse and a sword.

Mr. Whitehorse could.

rest of the evening.

11:01.375 --> 11:02.291

11:03.291 --> 11:04.750

11:05.834 --> 11:07.250

to play along for a second?

11:08.792 --> 11:11.583
This is my house

11:11.583 --> 11:13.834

I don't feel like playing
some parlor game.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.333
And I don't do small talk.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.041
Never have.

11:19.458 --> 11:20.959
Now, if you'll excuse me.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.625

I think he would've said
Clint Eastwood.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.792 --> 11:54.834
Looks good on you.

12:04.708 --> 12:06.875
[Laurel] Rebecca is helping me
produce a demo tomorrow.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.417
Just fantastic.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.583
-Isn't it, Ted?
-Yeah, that's great.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.250
There's a ringing endorsement.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.708
Honey, your midterms
were hardly stellar.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.208
Do you think now
is the right time to be doing
something like this?

12:19.208 --> 12:21.750
Okay, true,
I tanked my midterms.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.959
But that was because of
the whole Justin thing.

12:24.959 --> 12:27.000
Please, Dad, this is
an incredible opportunity.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.583
At least, that's what
Rebecca said.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.959
Yeah, I'm sure she did.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.083
I'll tell you what.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.583
You get all your
homework done,

12:34.583 --> 12:36.542
I will take you
to the studio tomorrow.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.500
-Kristin.
-It's an incredible
opportunity, Ted.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.834
No matter who arranged it.

12:40.834 --> 12:41.959
Thanks, Mom.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.750
I promise to get my grades up.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.083
[Kristin] Dinner's in
half an hour.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.250
That gives you plenty of time
to start your homework.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.708
Might want to work
on that poker face.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.041
[Alec] Laurel?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.708
As in Laurel Mercer?

13:01.708 --> 13:03.041
Yeah.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.417
I'm helping her
produce a demo.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.083
Why would you do
something like that?

13:08.583 --> 13:09.834
Getting that close
to the Mercers?

13:11.083 --> 13:13.583
She's a good kid,
deserves a break.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.959
I wish somebody was around
to give me a break
when I needed one.

13:15.959 --> 13:17.875
You mean somebody besides me?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.000
This is different.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.542
Tell me about it.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.583
So, I was practicing
my Grammy acceptance speech

13:34.583 --> 13:36.875
when I realized I haven't even
asked you how you're doing.

13:36.875 --> 13:37.875
Have you heard from Ethan?

13:38.458 --> 13:40.458
Not a word.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.333
I didn't know it was possible
to worry so much
about someone.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.750
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

13:47.834 --> 13:49.458
Distract me by talking
about anything else.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.542

13:55.542 --> 13:58.834
-Justin.
-Ah, Justin.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.875
Yeah, he wants to see
the song I'm writing,

14:00.875 --> 14:03.750
but he can't.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.125
Because it's about him?

14:05.125 --> 14:07.500
Yeah, and it's not
exactly a love song.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.959
-Mmm.
-Think Kelly Clarkson,

14:08.959 --> 14:10.375
not Taylor Swift.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.708
Can't wait to hear it.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.083
I just...

14:15.375 --> 14:18.166
I can't stop thinking about
how he started dating me

14:18.166 --> 14:20.500
with this twisted
ulterior motive.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.542
Yeah, that's a hard thing
to get past.

14:22.542 --> 14:25.125
And even though
Justin says he's done with it,

14:25.917 --> 14:26.959
I'm not sure I am.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.542
Have you talked to him
about any of this?

14:29.542 --> 14:31.792
And what am I supposed to say?

14:31.792 --> 14:33.041
"I just don't
trust you anymore"?

14:34.166 --> 14:36.166
I don't know.

14:36.583 --> 14:37.542
But...

14:39.583 --> 14:41.250
The only thing that matters
is telling the people

14:41.250 --> 14:43.291
that you love how you feel.

Even if it is
the hardest thing
in the world.

it's the only way out.

you would say, "Lie to him."

16:23.166 --> 16:24.458
What have we got?

16:24.458 --> 16:26.333
[Thayer] Gavin Turner.
That's the name
of the college kid

16:26.333 --> 16:28.125
-that Derek was dealing to.
-[Emma] Mmm-hmm.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.667
His charges were dropped
as well, but he is
a big deal on campus.

16:30.667 --> 16:31.792
President of the fraternity.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.667
And he got off.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.500
So why would he want
to hurt Derek?

16:35.500 --> 16:37.583
I don't know.
I'm not even sure
that he would.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.333
But there is a coincidence
here that we can't ignore.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.792
Phi Sigma Zeta,
Gavin's fraternity.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.834
Guess who's one of their
most devoted alums.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.125
Oh, my God.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.125
Dad?

16:55.667 --> 16:57.375
We need to go
to the fraternity
and talk to this Gavin guy.

16:57.834 --> 16:59.667
-Yeah.
-Why?

17:00.583 --> 17:02.041
So our dad's an alum.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.875
That explains why
he'd let Gavin
off easy,

17:03.875 --> 17:05.250
but not much else.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.291
He's connected to
Gavin and Derek

17:08.291 --> 17:09.750
'cause he helps kids
in trouble.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.208
Look, Mads, I don't want
to believe that
Dad has anything

17:12.208 --> 17:13.792
to do with this either,

17:13.792 --> 17:15.250
but we keep
finding connections.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.500
But to say that he's involved?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.750
We're not saying
he did anything. It... It's...

17:21.125 --> 17:22.834
We just have questions.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.875
Well, maybe we should
be asking Dad.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.083
Why aren't we giving him
an opportunity

17:26.083 --> 17:27.208
to defend himself?

17:27.208 --> 17:28.708
Thayer, look at me. Why?

17:29.458 --> 17:30.875
Because, what if we're wrong?

17:31.959 --> 17:33.166
Then he'll prove it to us.

accusing him of.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.917
How are we ever gonna
get back from there?

17:38.875 --> 17:41.333

all I want is evidence

17:41.333 --> 17:42.875

he's not involved,

have to confront him.

17:49.959 --> 17:52.208
There is a party
tomorrow night.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.125
Sorry. Got the Chinese.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.125
I'll leave you to it.

22:10.875 --> 22:13.291
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.458
Me, too.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.166
[neighs]

22:21.417 --> 22:23.125
How did things go
with your dad?

22:23.125 --> 22:24.834
As a matter of fact,
pretty good.

22:24.834 --> 22:25.792
Hmm.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.333
So, thanks again.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.291
Hey, come look.

22:32.291 --> 22:34.667
She must really
want that horse

22:34.667 --> 22:36.166
if she came back
after last night.

22:37.166 --> 22:38.458
Or she's a glutton
for punishment.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.000
[chuckles] I don't know.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.125
Look at your dad.
Is that an apology?

22:44.125 --> 22:48.208
"Just wanted to say, I'm sorry
for being such a jackass."

22:49.458 --> 22:52.834
"All is forgiven if you'll
take me on that hayride."

22:55.125 --> 22:56.625
-Again with the hayride?
-Well, I don't know.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.417
What do you want,
skinny dipping?

22:59.291 --> 23:01.041
"Yup, that sounds good.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.375
"Right after we have
a proper dinner."

23:03.375 --> 23:05.250
"You don't know how long
I've been waiting
for you to say that."

23:06.375 --> 23:08.834
"I've wanted to say it
a really long time.

23:08.834 --> 23:10.542
"I just never had the guts."

23:10.542 --> 23:12.583
"Oh, you've always
had plenty of guts.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.792
"That's one
of the things
I love about you."

23:15.792 --> 23:18.417
"Mmm, careful
how you throw
that word around."

23:24.667 --> 23:25.583
Hey.

23:27.542 --> 23:28.583
No fair.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.667
I didn't know
there were rules.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.750
-[Mads] I say we wait
for Gavin to approach us.
-[music playing]

23:44.750 --> 23:47.959
I'll do my flirt thing,
loosen him up,
get him talking.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.583
How subtle do you want this?

23:49.583 --> 23:52.250
We don't have time for subtle.
If there's nothing to this
Gavin-Alec connection,

23:52.250 --> 23:54.583
then we need to
get out fast and move on.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.333
-Hey, what's up, man?
-What's up?

23:59.125 --> 24:00.625
-Oh. He spotted us.
-I'll be right back.

24:00.625 --> 24:02.667
Okay, smile, everyone.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.125
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

24:05.959 --> 24:07.291
You know,
I never forget a face

24:07.291 --> 24:09.792
but I, uh, seem to
have forgotten all yours.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.166
And this party's
invitation only.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.000
High school, right?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.583
Uh, 18, if that's
what you're wondering.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.667
-Actually, I was about
to ask you to dance.
-[Mads] Oh.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.000
If my friends can stay.

24:22.583 --> 24:23.500
Sure.

24:24.792 --> 24:26.417
But that one needs
to learn how to smile

24:26.417 --> 24:27.333
and not bring her
boyfriend along.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.291
[scoffs]

24:29.417 --> 24:30.333
[whispers] Smile.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.917
Well, we have one foot
in the door.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.625
Or at least Mads does.

24:37.417 --> 24:39.500
You see that scrawny guy
watching us?

24:40.250 --> 24:42.125
I'm guessing a pledge.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.333
[Emma] He was at
Derek's funeral.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.291
I remember thinking,

24:46.291 --> 24:47.291
"He doesn't go
to school with me."

24:49.458 --> 24:51.375
You think he knows something?

24:51.375 --> 24:52.750
I don't know. Maybe.

24:56.792 --> 24:58.708
Look, I'm sorry.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.291
I should have been
more careful.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.834
I didn't think
your mom would be here.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.750
I didn't, either.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.000
All this lying...

25:13.291 --> 25:14.875
And sneaking around, I'm...

25:16.041 --> 25:17.542
I'm really tired of it.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.291
I'm a little confused.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.667
I can't do this anymore.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.333
It's just, I've tried.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.875
But I'm betraying my whole
family by staying with you.

25:37.041 --> 25:39.250
-But if you trust me, I--
-I don't.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.625
I don't, and that's just it.

25:45.667 --> 25:47.000
Laurel, look at me.

25:50.834 --> 25:52.542
When I look at you,

25:52.542 --> 25:55.083
I turn into something
I don't like.

25:55.083 --> 25:57.458
Someone who's crazy
and stupid.

25:58.417 --> 26:01.250
And I need to be honest
with my family.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.417
And with you.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.208
So, we're breaking up?

26:13.166 --> 26:14.125
Yeah.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.417
That's what we're doing.

26:20.417 --> 26:22.750
But I love you, Laurel.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.625
I'm sorry.

26:39.750 --> 26:40.875
[door opens]

26:42.083 --> 26:43.291
[Sutton] Ethan?

26:46.208 --> 26:47.333
Hey.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.708
You missed tamale night.

26:51.959 --> 26:54.417
It's okay.
I saved you a couple.

26:54.417 --> 26:57.667
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying
to do for my dad and me.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.083
Mmm.

26:59.083 --> 27:02.083
But right now, maybe it's best
if we just keep our distance.

27:03.583 --> 27:04.792
Keep our distance?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.041
Yeah.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.041
Uh...

27:09.041 --> 27:10.917
It's just a little overkill.

27:11.583 --> 27:12.917
Don't you think?

27:12.917 --> 27:14.875
I mean, we had a moment.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.166
No, it wasn't a moment, okay?

27:18.125 --> 27:20.834
It wasn't even
half a moment.

27:20.834 --> 27:22.458
Okay.
Then it was a non-moment.

27:24.250 --> 27:27.041
I got carried away.

27:27.041 --> 27:29.208
Well, you weren't alone.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.458
I was right there next to you.

27:35.417 --> 27:36.708
Okay.

27:36.708 --> 27:39.333
Yeah, yeah, I'm glad
I called, too.

27:39.333 --> 27:41.458
It was good to catch up.

27:41.458 --> 27:42.500
All right.

27:44.792 --> 27:46.417
Your brother says hello.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.834
You told Dan I was here?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.542
He's not going to
say anything.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.792
And what about Sutton?

27:53.792 --> 27:55.125
-Did you mention that she--
-She never came up.

27:57.834 --> 27:59.041
Okay, good.

28:00.291 --> 28:01.250
Dan doesn't like her.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.542
That's kind of
hard to believe.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.625
There's a part of Sutton
that you don't really know.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.792
Well, she got us to talk.

28:09.875 --> 28:10.750
That's something.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.750
[upbeat music]

28:23.250 --> 28:24.667
Looking for me?

28:26.625 --> 28:27.583
No.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.125
Were you at
Derek Rogers' funeral?

28:34.875 --> 28:38.375
I'm sorry. I think you got the
wrong person. I wasn't there.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.875
But you know
who I'm talking about, right?

28:44.041 --> 28:45.083
Look, I really
can't be talking to you

28:45.083 --> 28:45.917
about this right now.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.375
Okay, he seems nervous.

29:06.583 --> 29:08.708
[Gavin] So, who told you
there was weed here?

29:08.708 --> 29:10.083
Actually, there's
no booze, either.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.458
Mads? You okay?

29:13.458 --> 29:15.000
Yeah. Fine.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.708
[sighs] Okay, what is this?

29:16.708 --> 29:18.417
We just want to talk to you.

29:18.417 --> 29:21.792
Well, you could have done
that earlier in the night.

29:21.792 --> 29:24.458
All right, it looks like
you're looking for something
and it's obviously not weed.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.917
No, we're just here
to have some fun.

29:25.917 --> 29:28.000
We... We just have
some questions for you.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.667
Way too young to be cops.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.375
Actually, we're friends
of Derek Rogers.

29:32.125 --> 29:33.458
The guy you got busted with.

29:33.458 --> 29:34.667
The guy that's now dead.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.250
Yeah. That was unfortunate.

29:36.250 --> 29:40.208
Him dying,
or you getting busted?

29:40.208 --> 29:42.917
Well, both, actually.
Although, my charges
were never filed.

29:42.917 --> 29:44.917
Well, the killer's
still out there.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.083
I don't know
what happened to Derek,

29:46.083 --> 29:47.333
but I wasn't involved.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.458
Well, what about
someone else from this palace?

29:51.792 --> 29:53.125
You know, I'm not
having fun anymore.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.750
I think you guys should leave.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.375
Listen, we just want to know
if you've heard something

29:56.375 --> 29:57.708
or if you know
something, all right?

29:57.708 --> 29:59.458
No, Thayer, he's right.
We should go.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.000
-No, we should go.
-All right, Mads, come on.

30:02.750 --> 30:03.834
Sorry.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.834
Wait. Wait.
We just want to talk.

30:10.834 --> 30:12.208
I got nothing to say.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.583
What are you so scared of?
That Gavin guy?

30:14.583 --> 30:15.834
What do you know?

30:15.834 --> 30:18.000
I'm a pledge. Okay?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.959
I can't say anything.

30:19.959 --> 30:22.166
You were at
Derek Rogers' funeral.

30:22.166 --> 30:24.458
There has to be a reason.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.125
Did those guys
do something to him?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.625
Are you covering for them?

30:27.625 --> 30:29.792
-Sutton.
-No, I just want to know.

30:29.792 --> 30:32.250
Please. The wrong guy
is getting accused of this.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.458
All right.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.834
[sighs]

30:36.834 --> 30:38.125
Well, you're right
about Gavin.

30:38.125 --> 30:39.542
He's just a total jerk.

30:41.792 --> 30:43.542
I don't even know
if I want to be a member.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.917
Why? What did he do?

30:46.917 --> 30:48.750
After the charges
were dropped, he was still
buying from Derek.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.166
But he stopped doing it
in person.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.458
-He sent pledges?
-Yeah.

30:53.458 --> 30:55.333
And I was there the night
that Derek got killed.

30:56.625 --> 30:57.750
You saw who did it?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.083
Yeah.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.959
I didn't see him do it,
but I saw the argument.

31:04.542 --> 31:07.041
I told Gavin that I wanted
to go to the cops
but he said I couldn't.

31:07.041 --> 31:09.917
-Why not?
-Because...

31:09.917 --> 31:12.834
The guy I saw
I recognized him.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.917
He's an alum from the house...

31:19.500 --> 31:22.250
And he's
the district attorney.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.291
Alec Rybak.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.708
Yeah.

31:36.917 --> 31:38.250
[slow music playing]

31:38.959 --> 31:40.125
This is nice.

31:41.375 --> 31:42.875
The music or the wine?

31:44.417 --> 31:45.917
The dance partner.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.750
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Mmm.

31:50.834 --> 31:52.333
Someone's popular.

31:55.041 --> 31:56.333
Would you excuse me
for one minute?

31:56.333 --> 31:57.375
Okay.

32:00.250 --> 32:01.458
One minute.

32:05.458 --> 32:06.583
Hello.

32:12.458 --> 32:14.083
You're damn straight
I'm looking
for Ethan Whitehorse.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.125
What do you got?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.750
The guy was just some kid.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.792
A kid with a conscience
that they tried to keep quiet.

32:23.792 --> 32:24.917
But to say that my
dad had anything--

32:24.917 --> 32:25.834
I know.

32:26.667 --> 32:29.583
I know it hurts, Mads,

32:29.583 --> 32:31.583
but I don't want to believe it
any more than you do.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.875
We just need to find out
what Rebecca might know.

32:33.875 --> 32:36.667
If she's his alibi,
then your father's
off the hook.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.500
No one can be
at two places at once.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.667
Except you and Sutton.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.000
Rebecca's gonna say
that my dad was
with her that night,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.959
not fighting in some garage
with Derek.

32:46.959 --> 32:49.208
I saw her with my dad
at our house.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.667
What time?

32:50.667 --> 32:51.959
I got home around 11:00.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.667
I know Derek was killed
before that, but...

32:56.333 --> 32:59.291
-Rebecca!
-Sutton, Mads. Hi.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.291
-So, shall we chat?
-Yeah.

33:05.208 --> 33:08.166
So sorry to hear
about Ethan, Sutton.
You must be so worried.

33:08.166 --> 33:11.500
Actually, that's why we wanted
to have lunch with you.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.917
Yeah, you know Dad's been
all over this case.

33:13.917 --> 33:15.667
-Finding Ethan.
-[Rebecca] Yes.

33:16.458 --> 33:18.750
He's mentioned it.

33:18.750 --> 33:22.667
But unfortunately for you
he's pretty sure
Ethan's guilty, so...

33:22.667 --> 33:26.291
Well, I'm not.
We're not exactly convinced.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.208
The night Derek died,
you two had a date.

33:36.208 --> 33:37.208
Yes.

33:38.542 --> 33:41.834
Um, dinner at his place.
It was a lovely evening.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.959
And you were there
all evening, right?

33:47.875 --> 33:48.875
Yeah.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.583
Well, that settles that.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.417
Settles what?

33:56.417 --> 33:58.834
Hey. Hi, Sutton, Mads.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.458
Rebecca,
I need to talk to you.

34:00.458 --> 34:01.917
You got a second?

34:01.917 --> 34:03.000
-Sure.
-Great.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.750
She'll be right back.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.125
Excuse me.

34:09.875 --> 34:10.917
Satisfied?

34:13.500 --> 34:14.542
Not yet.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.166
Couldn't this wait?
I was having lunch
with your daughter.

34:22.166 --> 34:23.708
I want you to stay
away from my family.

34:23.708 --> 34:25.417
Stay away from Kristin,
stay away from Laurel

34:25.417 --> 34:26.625
and stay away from Sutton.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.291
Ted, calm down.

34:28.291 --> 34:29.250
No, I'm not gonna calm down.

34:32.917 --> 34:34.625
I hope you're not
operating anytime soon.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.959
We wouldn't want a repeat
of what happened

34:37.959 --> 34:39.583
to Justin Miller's mother,
now, would we?

34:43.041 --> 34:44.667
How do you know about that?

34:44.667 --> 34:46.708
-Isn't that why you left L.A.?
-You know damn well
why I left L.A.--

34:46.708 --> 34:48.583
[Tom] Dr. Mercer?

34:48.583 --> 34:50.375
-[sighs]
-Is everything all right?

34:50.375 --> 34:51.625
Yes.

34:51.625 --> 34:52.750
Yes, Tom, I'm sorry.

34:52.750 --> 34:53.708
Thank you, fine.

35:04.708 --> 35:06.708
-What are you doing?
-I need to talk to Emma.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.583
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

35:09.583 --> 35:11.667
I mean, your brother
and Thayer,
they all warned you.

35:12.750 --> 35:13.625
I don't care.

35:14.583 --> 35:15.708
I get it.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.375
[laptop beeping]

35:19.250 --> 35:21.041
Ethan? I've been
so worried about you.

35:23.375 --> 35:26.250
It is insane
how much I miss you.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.458
I... I feel the same way.

35:29.291 --> 35:30.291
How's Sutton?

35:31.291 --> 35:32.583
Where is she?

35:32.583 --> 35:34.500
Uh, she's outside.

35:35.834 --> 35:39.041
Okay, well, we're making
progress on the killer.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.625
[Mads] Uh, that's not true.

35:40.625 --> 35:42.417
We don't know anything.

35:42.959 --> 35:44.000
Wait a minute.

35:44.792 --> 35:46.250
Mads knows?

35:46.250 --> 35:49.041
About me and Sutton.
It's kind of a long story.

35:49.041 --> 35:50.375
The important thing is
that Alec could have--

35:50.375 --> 35:51.375
He is not a killer.

35:52.792 --> 35:54.542
You heard Rebecca.
He has an alibi.

35:54.542 --> 35:55.959
Look, where's Sutton?

35:55.959 --> 35:57.959
She'd agree that my dad would
never do something like this.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.792
[Thayer]  Guys, stop it.

35:59.792 --> 36:02.000
Ethan, you have to
get off this thing.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.625
You've been on
too long already.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.625
Okay, all right, I...
I just need to talk to her
for a second.

36:05.625 --> 36:07.166
And, uh, Thayer's right,
we can't risk it.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.291
Okay, I... I just...

36:09.250 --> 36:10.333
[laptop beeps]

36:11.000 --> 36:12.208
I love you.

36:15.834 --> 36:16.875
[sighs]

36:30.667 --> 36:32.792
[Kristin] I've been
trying your cell.
I... I called the club.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.333
Tom said you had words
with Rebecca?

36:36.333 --> 36:38.834
Oh, it's not even
worth talking about.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.583
Well, I want to talk about it.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.000
[sighs] Kristin, please.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.667
No. I am tired
of being lied to.

36:45.667 --> 36:47.000
I'm not lying.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.125
That is a lie.

36:49.125 --> 36:52.375
What are you talking about?
What lie? What am I doing?

36:52.375 --> 36:54.875
I want to know what's going on
with you and Rebecca.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.917
You change every time
her name comes up.

36:56.917 --> 36:58.708
And when the two of you
are in a room together

36:58.708 --> 37:00.917
it gets strange.

37:01.875 --> 37:02.917
[sighs]

37:05.333 --> 37:09.000
Kristin, okay, please.
We're not having
this discussion.

37:09.000 --> 37:09.917
Okay?

37:11.041 --> 37:12.917
[sighs] Nothing is going on.

37:20.917 --> 37:22.542
How's your filet?

37:22.542 --> 37:25.333
Mmm. Mmm!

37:25.333 --> 37:27.708
-Cooked to perfection.
-Mmm? Mmm?

37:27.708 --> 37:29.375
You're really
spoiling me, Alec.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.083
That is my intention.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.250
Hey, Mads told me
you guys had lunch

37:36.250 --> 37:37.375
at the club today,
is that right?

37:37.375 --> 37:40.792
Mmm, yeah, Sutton and Mads.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.667
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, it was delightful,

37:42.667 --> 37:45.333
albeit a little strange.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.917
-Delightfully strange?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

37:46.917 --> 37:48.708
How so?

37:48.708 --> 37:52.250
Well, they were asking me
a lot of questions about you

37:52.250 --> 37:53.458
and the night that
Derek was killed.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.250
So, I... I told them
that we were at dinner

37:58.250 --> 38:00.166
at your house
all night, and...

38:00.166 --> 38:01.375
You know, which is true.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.250
-That's the truth.
-Yeah.

38:02.667 --> 38:03.583
Hmm.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.917
Listen, they're just kids.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.333
They're curious.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.959
They were all good friends
with Derek.

38:09.959 --> 38:10.917
I'm not surprised.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.250
You know what?
This may be the best
cut I ever had.

38:17.875 --> 38:18.959
Ted came by, too.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.166
He got a...
A little emotional.

38:23.166 --> 38:24.625
Really?

38:24.625 --> 38:26.708
[chuckles] Yeah.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.875
I think you're teasing him.
Just a little bit.

38:29.583 --> 38:30.500
Hmm.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.959
And I think you like it.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.375
I don't do that kind
of thing, Alec.

38:36.375 --> 38:37.500
You should know that by now.

38:38.291 --> 38:39.208
It's not in my nature.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.208
Yeah.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.542
Aren't you gonna ask
how it went with Emma?

38:57.291 --> 38:59.708
[sighs] I'm sure
it was perfect.

39:05.542 --> 39:06.625
Actually, you were right.

39:07.834 --> 39:09.083
-Mmm.
-I shouldn't have called her.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.583
There was a lot
going on over there.

39:12.583 --> 39:15.208
And they're deep
into this thing.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.000
Well, she loves you.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.083
She'll do anything for you.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.542
-[clears throat]
-You do that a lot.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.542
What? My hair flip?

39:26.542 --> 39:28.041
Flashes of honesty.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.917
Sometimes the truth
scares me.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.458
You? Scared?

39:38.500 --> 39:39.500
I don't believe it.

39:41.417 --> 39:43.667
It's a whole
other kind of risk.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.333
Putting yourself out there.

39:47.417 --> 39:49.458
Like you
opening up to your dad,

39:50.542 --> 39:51.750
your dad opening up to you.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.083
I'm glad I did it.

39:55.083 --> 39:56.458
It was worth the risk.

would make me feel better

but it just made me
feel worse.

about all of it.
