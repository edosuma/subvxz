- (announcer) Previously on "Hunters"...
- (Jackson) McCarthy.

00:03.160 --> 00:05.709
You let our most prized asset get away.

00:05.719 --> 00:08.222
Abby isn't dead. I was with her yesterday.

00:08.232 --> 00:11.149
(Flynn) She's gone, Emme.
You have to let her go.

00:11.183 --> 00:13.218
I know what you are. I've seen one.

00:13.252 --> 00:15.588
- (clicking)
- Guanos are after a human.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.822
- Sterling Martinez.
- It's just research.

00:17.857 --> 00:19.102
(Regan) Don't know why they want him.

00:19.112 --> 00:21.845
It has to do with something
they called the Purge.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.495
- Do not disappoint me.
- I won't.

00:23.529 --> 00:27.065
(shrieking)

00:27.099 --> 00:30.902
- You don't know shit about me.
- You don't know shit about you.

00:30.912 --> 00:32.670
(Jackson) And what about Regan's father?

00:32.705 --> 00:35.147
- He clearly loves his child.
- Who did this to you?

00:35.157 --> 00:36.536
He wasn't spared torture.

00:36.546 --> 00:38.143
Which is precisely why
I kept you out of it.

00:38.177 --> 00:40.498
Your mother tried to kill me.

00:41.754 --> 00:43.812
She's Musa's right hand.

(Briggs) Abby doesn't want to
turn herself in, this is her play.

02:24.617 --> 02:26.784
You're not gonna have the
guts to do anything about it.

02:26.819 --> 02:28.932
Why the hell didn't you stop her?!

02:29.415 --> 02:31.864
I couldn't imagine living without you.

02:34.293 --> 02:35.893
You're a survivor, Flynn.

02:35.928 --> 02:38.542
I only keep on going because of you.

02:43.802 --> 02:45.536
(creature clicking)

02:45.571 --> 02:47.138
(man screaming)

02:47.172 --> 02:49.207
(tires screeching)

02:57.449 --> 03:00.278
(Ted) I didn't think I'd
ever have coffee again.

03:00.679 --> 03:02.266
<i>Or see you.</i>

03:02.530 --> 03:06.242
If we're gonna keep meeting,
there are things I need to ask you.

03:06.252 --> 03:09.167
- Finnerman's conditions?
- (Regan) <i>No, my conditions.</i>

03:09.177 --> 03:11.396
<i>I don't give a shit
what Finnerman wants.</i>

03:11.430 --> 03:13.440
<i>I care about stopping Musa.</i>

03:13.450 --> 03:15.819
We don't have the capacity
to house prisoners.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.376
It's only temporary.

03:17.386 --> 03:19.987
And I have nowhere else
to house him now, do I?

03:19.997 --> 03:22.709
The last thing we need is McCarthy
to turn up to the black site

03:22.719 --> 03:24.393
and attempt a rescue mission.

03:24.403 --> 03:27.445
Regan should not be
interrogating her own father.

03:27.455 --> 03:30.081
- It's too personal.
- For her or for you?

03:30.115 --> 03:32.073
(cell phone buzzing)

03:32.083 --> 03:33.456
Jackson.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.259
What?

03:35.714 --> 03:36.879
When?

03:38.738 --> 03:40.231
Is Flynn all right?

03:41.960 --> 03:44.163
(Regan) <i>What can you tell
me about Viktor Karp?</i>

03:44.173 --> 03:46.214
I don't know the name.

03:46.770 --> 03:50.614
Karp was moving lithium out
of the mine you and mom ran.

03:50.624 --> 03:53.783
ETU raided the offices last week.

03:54.807 --> 03:56.611
He started as a drug runner.

03:57.230 --> 04:00.922
Now he transports weapons.
Is Musa planning an attack?

04:00.932 --> 04:04.479
- I mean, is that what the Purge is?
- I... I don't know.

04:04.789 --> 04:06.701
I never met Karp.

04:07.093 --> 04:09.193
Only your mother dealt with him.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.087
So Mom dealt with Karp, what did you do?

04:13.097 --> 04:16.444
I had other business.

04:16.810 --> 04:19.481
I also maintained the family unit.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.755
I took my job seriously.

04:25.988 --> 04:28.523
That part was always real.

04:34.664 --> 04:37.199
(heart monitor beeping)

04:40.102 --> 04:42.204
(door opens)

04:43.827 --> 04:45.784
Guy's got nine lives.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.918
Got away with just cuts and bruises.

04:47.928 --> 04:49.988
And a hell of a hangover.

04:50.835 --> 04:52.856
We sure it was just an accident?

04:53.175 --> 04:56.489
Doc says his blood alcohol level was 0.23.

04:58.338 --> 05:00.890
Deliberate, then? Because of his wife?

05:00.900 --> 05:03.251
That and he's battle-bent.

05:03.552 --> 05:06.204
Came at me pretty hard yesterday.

05:06.238 --> 05:08.222
Are you two going to be
able to work together?

05:08.232 --> 05:10.675
No, I don't take that shit personally.

05:10.918 --> 05:13.978
But I can't say the
same for sleeping beauty.

05:14.013 --> 05:17.053
God knows he could tell anybody anything.

05:17.499 --> 05:22.122
It was his drive to find his
wife that led us to McCarthy.

05:22.132 --> 05:24.670
Perhaps he can still be of some use.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.391
And if he's not?

05:26.838 --> 05:28.140
Well...

05:29.251 --> 05:30.601
we pull the plug.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.588
(Regan) Latest SAT intel
has Karp running planes

05:35.598 --> 05:37.969
from a dirt strip in Northern Mexico.

05:38.003 --> 05:39.637
No, we know where Karp is,

05:39.647 --> 05:41.633
and his entire family for that matter.

05:41.643 --> 05:43.139
That's never been the issue.

05:43.149 --> 05:45.743
We just confirmed, Karp's
working with the Hunters.

05:45.753 --> 05:48.246
Karp also has ongoing
dealings with the CIA.

05:48.256 --> 05:51.316
- He's protected.
- I don't want Karp.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.184
I want the bitch he answers to.

05:54.519 --> 05:57.872
- Your mother.
- She knows more than my dad ever could.

05:57.882 --> 06:01.381
That's whose fingernails you
should be pulling out with pliers.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.229
You did well with your father.

06:04.451 --> 06:08.074
You gained more in ten
minutes than we have in years.

06:08.084 --> 06:10.968
You hurt him again and I
will tear your throat out.

06:10.978 --> 06:12.690
Careful, Agent Regan.

06:12.854 --> 06:16.785
Threatening a superior officer
is cause for immediate dismissal.

06:17.049 --> 06:18.943
You won't.

06:18.978 --> 06:22.180
You need me and you know it.

06:22.552 --> 06:24.325
Let me go to Mexico.

06:24.744 --> 06:28.186
I go through Karp to get
my mom and I bring her back.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.644
In exchange, you release my dad.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.343
I don't feel anything.

06:43.353 --> 06:46.649
The scute protein's solution's tricky,
but I think I'm making progress.

06:46.659 --> 06:48.244
You think?

06:49.169 --> 06:51.042
Well, I haven't slept in days.

06:51.653 --> 06:54.220
Maybe if you just let me get some rest.

06:54.421 --> 06:56.533
I just got kidnapped by space aliens

06:56.543 --> 06:59.693
to conduct a freaking top
secret science experiment.

07:00.525 --> 07:02.181
You know what we need.

07:02.191 --> 07:04.104
Accelerated regrowth of your native mantle.

07:04.114 --> 07:06.825
I understand what you're
asking but come on.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.007
He's doing the best he can.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.527
(gasps)

07:13.719 --> 07:15.140
Do better.

07:17.033 --> 07:19.237
(panting)

07:24.984 --> 07:26.744
Liana's under a lot of pressure.

07:27.542 --> 07:31.964
Don't worry, once you crack this,
you'll be back home, safe and sound.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.649
What if I can't?

07:34.477 --> 07:36.153
I won't let her harm you.

07:37.294 --> 07:39.324
You have my word.

07:39.639 --> 07:42.679
(Spanish music playing)

07:42.689 --> 07:45.966
_

07:49.268 --> 07:51.236
(chickens clucking)

07:58.535 --> 07:59.910
<i>Adíos.</i>

08:44.256 --> 08:46.374
(Ted) Allison's in a play this weekend.

08:46.384 --> 08:49.527
- Put the meeting off a couple days.
- (Liana) You know I can't do that.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.930
Going to school events
is what normal parents do.

08:51.964 --> 08:55.192
So you're behind schedule in your
research because of PTA meetings?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.646
There is no time to waste!

08:56.656 --> 08:59.656
We've got to get the
reversion procedure working!

09:00.997 --> 09:02.407
Mommy?

09:02.417 --> 09:05.305
Allison. What are you still doing up?

09:05.315 --> 09:07.946
It's late, honey, you
should be asleep by now.

09:10.329 --> 09:13.453
- (chuckling)
- This is exactly what I'm talking about.

09:13.463 --> 09:15.954
Fostering human tendencies
only confuses her.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.789
- It's not fair, Ted.
- Let's get you back to bed.

09:17.823 --> 09:21.734
Making her think she's something
she's not, it's not fair to her!

09:54.274 --> 09:56.861
(fingers snapping)

10:39.869 --> 10:41.827
<i>Déjame verla.</i>

10:43.475 --> 10:45.310
<i>No le dejen mover.</i>

10:46.980 --> 10:48.578
Take off your clothes.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.638
She's clean.

11:41.216 --> 11:44.335
Viktor Karp, I'm Regan.

11:44.763 --> 11:48.072
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.623
ETU.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.135
I'm out. That's why I'm here.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.215
What happened here?

12:01.379 --> 12:04.689
I had a baby. The humans took it.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.725
(chuckling)

12:12.431 --> 12:14.599
Why you want to see Liana?

12:15.174 --> 12:16.612
I'm her daughter.

12:17.568 --> 12:19.762
Liana doesn't have a daughter.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.908
(grunts)

12:33.074 --> 12:35.208
(Flynn sighs)

12:37.108 --> 12:38.847
You're at home.

12:39.366 --> 12:40.805
So I see.

12:43.447 --> 12:45.051
I had you brought here.

12:46.026 --> 12:50.492
We needed you someplace private in
case you said something you shouldn't.

12:52.132 --> 12:54.183
Flynn, you got a drug problem.

12:54.193 --> 12:55.513
No.

12:56.505 --> 12:59.225
- No. I got an alien problem.
- Well, you need to deal with it

12:59.235 --> 13:01.035
before I let you back on the team.

13:01.070 --> 13:02.312
Team?

13:02.904 --> 13:04.133
Right.

13:04.843 --> 13:08.276
'Cause we're all just team
players, aren't we, Truss?

13:09.052 --> 13:10.545
You're using me.

13:11.028 --> 13:13.095
You're using Regan.

13:14.049 --> 13:16.615
God knows what you got on Briggs.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.556
You are privy to information
that is beyond classified.

13:21.590 --> 13:25.342
And if I don't come back and
play, you're gonna contain me?

13:25.352 --> 13:27.295
(Jackson) If I have to.

13:27.305 --> 13:30.004
Flynn, are you all right?

13:31.133 --> 13:33.067
Yeah, I'm great.

13:33.458 --> 13:36.955
- What are you doing here?
- My counselor brought me.

13:37.414 --> 13:40.469
- Your boss said you had an accident.
- (groans)

13:41.810 --> 13:43.169
Yeah.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.769
Your story checks out.

13:57.192 --> 14:01.369
Well, I'm sorry for the security measures.

14:03.381 --> 14:04.861
Are you comfortable?

14:05.061 --> 14:08.711
Give me what I want and I don't
give a damn where you hold me.

14:09.538 --> 14:13.575
You fought against the Hunters,
but now you want to join them?

14:13.609 --> 14:16.393
The humans took me away from my mother.

14:16.639 --> 14:18.296
They took my baby.

14:18.706 --> 14:22.175
They used me, made me
fight against the Hunters.

14:23.672 --> 14:25.984
I want to be with my own kind.

14:26.822 --> 14:29.157
I think I believe that.

14:30.083 --> 14:33.160
So Liana's coming for me?

14:33.488 --> 14:35.109
Not quite yet.

15:27.166 --> 15:30.685
First time I shot up, I was 16.

15:30.719 --> 15:33.674
I was a punky-ass kid on a skateboard.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.388
In the parking lot of a
7-11 in Davenport, Texas,

15:37.398 --> 15:41.763
I bought a dime bag from a
dealer named Shotgun Vallardo.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.078
One taste and I was hooked.

15:44.734 --> 15:47.333
So you were a junkie. Is
that supposed to impress me?

15:47.343 --> 15:49.504
Oh, I wasn't hooked on the junk.

15:49.918 --> 15:51.729
I was hooked on the deal.

15:51.739 --> 15:55.910
Next day I was running for
Shotgun. And six months later,

15:56.087 --> 15:57.880
Shotgun's wife was a widow

15:57.890 --> 16:01.282
and I had every last one
of his buyers in my pocket.

16:01.647 --> 16:05.253
See, we're the same under the
skin, you, me, all us Hunters.

16:05.818 --> 16:07.765
We have the same animal urges.

16:07.775 --> 16:11.821
The desire, the will, and the
strength to destroy and dominate.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.495
What are you gonna do with my blood?

16:17.505 --> 16:21.648
Angel, don't you worry your
pretty little head about that.

16:21.658 --> 16:25.006
You keep your end of the
deal and I'll keep mine.

16:26.721 --> 16:31.714
(recording of creature clicking)

16:36.571 --> 16:40.022
Anything you'd like to say
about what you've heard so far?

16:42.571 --> 16:44.958
We've reunited you with your daughter.

16:44.968 --> 16:47.848
<i>I only ask that you
translate Hunter recordings</i>

16:47.858 --> 16:50.530
<i>that we've intercepted.</i>

16:50.540 --> 16:51.766
<i>No.</i>

16:51.943 --> 16:53.755
I'll start then, shall I?

16:55.170 --> 16:57.238
Hunters have been sourcing lithium.

16:58.168 --> 17:02.020
Enriched lithium is a fuel
source for nuclear warheads.

17:02.030 --> 17:04.603
And Musa has been working with Viktor Karp,

17:04.613 --> 17:08.253
and arm's dealer who has
access to long-range missiles.

17:08.518 --> 17:10.104
All right so far?

17:10.659 --> 17:14.559
Well, you seem to have it all
worked out. What do you need from me?

17:18.143 --> 17:21.295
Cockroaches are extraordinary creatures.

17:21.329 --> 17:22.877
Very hardy.

17:23.606 --> 17:25.741
They're extremely adaptive.

17:26.223 --> 17:27.626
They molt.

17:27.826 --> 17:29.128
They chirp.

17:29.138 --> 17:30.931
They have shells.

17:32.364 --> 17:35.376
And they can survive a nuclear explosion.

17:36.452 --> 17:38.108
Hunters molt.

17:38.118 --> 17:41.018
They click. They have shells.

17:41.028 --> 17:43.405
And they have nuclear weapons.

17:44.552 --> 17:46.854
I think that you,

17:47.133 --> 17:50.825
Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells

17:50.835 --> 17:53.385
because Musa is planning a nuclear attack,

17:53.395 --> 17:55.114
and that's how you'll survive.

17:55.124 --> 17:58.146
You have no idea what you're talking about.

18:00.602 --> 18:03.882
We did well in raising your
daughter for you, don't you think?

18:03.892 --> 18:06.747
By turning her against her own kind?

18:06.757 --> 18:10.010
- No. No, I don't.
- When we found Allison,

18:10.045 --> 18:13.451
she was on a direct course
for self-destruction.

18:14.734 --> 18:18.078
Poor kid would be dead by
now if we hadn't intervened.

18:18.088 --> 18:20.210
We saved her life, Ted.

18:22.402 --> 18:26.434
You might even say that I still
have a hand in keeping her alive.

18:29.993 --> 18:32.433
Should we have another listen?

18:36.699 --> 18:39.373
(recording of creature clicking)

18:55.386 --> 18:58.742
(Karp) Don't worry. Your
daughter's not going anywhere.

19:01.097 --> 19:04.220
Yeah, we can keep her as long as you like.

19:09.912 --> 19:11.887
I understand your timeline, Liana.

19:11.897 --> 19:14.347
No, we're arranging transportation now.

19:15.592 --> 19:18.333
Tell Musa his delivery's on its way.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.305
Florida, seriously?

19:50.340 --> 19:53.508
Right. Well, we'll move
somewhere colder, then.

19:53.807 --> 19:56.423
- Canada?
- Maple syrup and mullets?

19:56.433 --> 19:58.246
- No thanks.
- (chuckling)

20:01.318 --> 20:03.018
Did mom fight for me?

20:04.281 --> 20:06.774
You told her I wanted
to live with you, right?

20:06.784 --> 20:09.191
Yes, but...

20:12.972 --> 20:15.295
She didn't put up a fight, did she?

20:15.404 --> 20:19.311
Liana was overwhelmed by the
news. She doesn't want us to leave.

20:19.346 --> 20:21.213
- Screw her.
- Don't be like that.

20:21.223 --> 20:25.119
Like what? She's never home.
She treats you like shit.

20:25.129 --> 20:27.629
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.

20:35.325 --> 20:37.407
- Hey.
- What are you two up to?

20:37.442 --> 20:40.629
Nothing, God, don't be
such a paranoid freak.

20:47.051 --> 20:48.978
(door slams)

20:50.189 --> 20:52.055
Party time, princess.

21:10.592 --> 21:12.503
It's time for us to say goodbye.

21:12.513 --> 21:15.226
Like hell. We made a deal, Karp.

21:16.177 --> 21:19.511
- Liana's coming.
- She's... she's coming here?

21:21.101 --> 21:22.923
It's a family reunion.

21:23.815 --> 21:26.105
And I'm off to one of my own.

21:26.591 --> 21:28.144
Farewell, my sweet.

21:30.483 --> 21:33.330
Your generosity will not be forgotten.

21:49.653 --> 21:51.245
It was just an accident.

21:51.255 --> 21:54.615
Motorcycles don't have seat belts.

21:55.407 --> 21:59.156
You could have died. If
you had died, I'd be alone.

21:59.190 --> 22:01.276
You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead.

22:01.286 --> 22:04.428
Emme, I said I'm sorry.

22:04.605 --> 22:06.644
What else do you want me to say?

22:06.654 --> 22:07.792
Huh?

22:10.060 --> 22:13.136
He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine.

22:16.407 --> 22:18.463
How are you holding up, Emme?

22:18.473 --> 22:20.033
Holding what up?

22:20.043 --> 22:22.619
How are you doing with Flynn being hurt?

22:22.783 --> 22:24.514
I'm fine.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.436
He's not going to die.

22:30.613 --> 22:32.723
Did my counselor leave?

22:32.757 --> 22:34.894
She'll be here in a few
minutes, take you back home.

22:34.904 --> 22:37.794
You mean school. This is my home.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.254
Yeah, of course it is.

22:40.582 --> 22:43.233
I'm gonna go look for Haydn.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.203
The cat. The composer's dead.

22:47.691 --> 22:49.102
Okay.

22:56.330 --> 22:57.848
Shit!

23:21.210 --> 23:23.723
_

23:25.943 --> 23:27.290
Abby?

23:28.012 --> 23:29.412
What?

23:50.968 --> 23:53.904
(clicking)

24:03.699 --> 24:07.805
Is this usual for your...
people in your native form?

24:08.752 --> 24:10.653
She's building a nest.

24:10.663 --> 24:12.956
We do it during molting and breeding.

24:13.420 --> 24:17.060
- I know, it looks...
- Freaky as shit. No offense.

24:18.613 --> 24:20.753
Trust me, it's a good sign.

24:30.247 --> 24:31.986
Can I ask you something?

24:32.706 --> 24:36.146
Is everyone here, all
the workers, are they...

24:36.584 --> 24:37.867
what you are?

24:37.877 --> 24:41.051
No, a few are human,
scientists like you are.

24:41.085 --> 24:44.828
- They're here of their own accord.
- Lucky them.

24:48.159 --> 24:50.889
I'm sorry I had to
bring you here like this.

24:50.899 --> 24:53.129
It's not me that I'm worried about.

24:53.430 --> 24:55.105
It's my family.

24:55.979 --> 24:58.996
- My kids.
- You have children?

24:59.006 --> 25:01.257
Two. Six and eight.

25:01.973 --> 25:03.889
They live with my ex.

25:04.463 --> 25:05.783
You?

25:06.311 --> 25:08.287
You have any little ones?

25:08.916 --> 25:10.655
A daughter.

25:10.883 --> 25:12.358
She's 16.

25:13.114 --> 25:14.561
She here?

25:15.354 --> 25:17.548
She's not with me anymore.

25:19.124 --> 25:20.735
You miss her?

25:22.465 --> 25:24.127
Very much.

25:24.161 --> 25:28.265
(creature clicking)

25:37.236 --> 25:39.357
The mantle's quite pronounced now.

25:42.005 --> 25:43.690
You're almost home.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.517
(clicking)

26:19.519 --> 26:21.163
(groaning)

26:21.173 --> 26:22.986
(door opens and closes)

26:31.817 --> 26:33.329
Hey, Mom.

26:38.194 --> 26:40.243
Why did you come here?

26:40.780 --> 26:42.850
I needed to see you...

26:42.860 --> 26:44.352
in person.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.006
You didn't ask to see me before,

26:47.016 --> 26:50.952
- when you were with Musa.
- I wanted to, but I was afraid.

26:51.159 --> 26:52.852
Of your own mother?

26:53.654 --> 26:57.659
I thought you would
reject me, send me away.

26:57.896 --> 27:00.426
And yet you ran away from the Hunt,

27:00.690 --> 27:02.831
from Abby and the others.

27:03.091 --> 27:04.911
It was too much too fast.

27:04.921 --> 27:08.136
When I saw Jules, I couldn't
handle it, but Musa was right.

27:08.204 --> 27:10.305
I don't belong at the ETU.

27:12.636 --> 27:15.343
I'm tired of hating myself,

27:15.411 --> 27:18.880
of fighting what I really
am. You can help me.

27:19.397 --> 27:22.851
You didn't raise me as a
Hunter, but you can now.

27:25.421 --> 27:27.649
I want you to be my mom again.

27:28.991 --> 27:31.106
Why should I believe you?

27:31.224 --> 27:32.908
I'm here, aren't I?

27:33.072 --> 27:35.296
Love does swing the hammer.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.019
I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.233
Then show me.

27:42.562 --> 27:46.443
Come closer. It's been ten years
since we've seen each other.

27:46.453 --> 27:49.129
The least you can do is give me a hug.

27:52.397 --> 27:54.543
You think I'm gonna hurt you?

27:54.798 --> 27:57.202
You would if Musa told you to.

27:59.288 --> 28:02.510
What Musa and I have struggled for is worth

28:02.656 --> 28:06.179
more than any one single person.
It's about our species' survival.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.396
We've all had to make sacrifices.

28:08.611 --> 28:11.199
Now tell me, I was yours.

28:12.196 --> 28:16.111
The bond between Hunters is
different, deeper than humans.

28:16.121 --> 28:20.471
We're not just family, we're inside
each other, it's how we're made.

28:20.726 --> 28:24.492
Losing you was the worst
thing that ever happened to me.

28:25.047 --> 28:28.361
Like a part of me was ripped from my flesh.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.646
And I never forgot it, Allison, never.

28:31.801 --> 28:35.570
Not one day has gone past
when I haven't thought of you.

28:37.356 --> 28:38.593
You...

28:40.196 --> 28:42.019
are a part of me.

28:43.158 --> 28:44.899
And I love you.

28:47.974 --> 28:49.437
I love you, too.

28:55.675 --> 28:57.214
(grunts)

29:02.051 --> 29:03.542
(groans)

29:07.479 --> 29:09.427
(sonic blasts)

29:18.528 --> 29:20.549
(grunts)

29:23.454 --> 29:25.239
That hollow in your back is sacred.

29:25.249 --> 29:27.366
That's where we carry our
young in their native form.

29:27.376 --> 29:29.477
You defiled it because
you despise yourself.

29:29.487 --> 29:32.747
I blame your father for
that. Ted ruined you, Allison,

29:32.757 --> 29:35.423
and yet I'm the one you
hate. You were born a Hunter!

29:35.433 --> 29:37.501
You know how you came to look like you do?

29:38.015 --> 29:39.839
I chose this body for you,

29:39.849 --> 29:41.638
a vehicle to keep you safe and strong.

29:41.648 --> 29:44.318
You killed someone for their body?

29:44.328 --> 29:46.546
For you! I chose well.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.316
- I was a child. A baby!
- That baby would have died anyway.

29:50.326 --> 29:51.906
Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.552
I did it a favor and I did it for you!

29:53.562 --> 29:54.837
Stop!

30:04.304 --> 30:08.031
(straining)

30:11.869 --> 30:13.570
(cries out)

30:32.023 --> 30:33.423
(grunts)

30:37.028 --> 30:38.995
(panting)

31:32.926 --> 31:34.310
No!

31:50.923 --> 31:52.847
(groans)

31:57.154 --> 31:59.857
- There's water in the tap.
- (sighs)

32:02.226 --> 32:03.592
Good to know.

32:05.039 --> 32:07.698
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.

32:10.561 --> 32:14.068
Come back for more, have you, tough guy?

32:14.102 --> 32:17.071
Oh, you're looking a
whole lot worse than I am.

32:17.662 --> 32:19.265
Whatever.

32:23.481 --> 32:24.855
Where are you going?

32:24.865 --> 32:27.340
Tequila and tacos. You want?

32:27.350 --> 32:31.052
- Come back inside, we need to talk.
- (scoffs)

32:31.517 --> 32:33.976
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.766
Ah, shit. Seriously?

32:38.709 --> 32:40.985
Okay. I get it.

32:43.374 --> 32:45.331
Jackson's hatchet, man.

32:45.341 --> 32:46.586
Come on.

32:47.410 --> 32:48.739
Here I am,

32:49.413 --> 32:50.655
do it.

32:51.647 --> 32:53.335
Go back inside the house,

32:53.345 --> 32:57.269
I'll grab my service weapon,
tell Jackson I made a move on you.

32:57.761 --> 32:59.603
He doesn't have to know.

33:00.432 --> 33:02.935
I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs.

33:05.667 --> 33:07.351
Let's take a drive.

33:12.710 --> 33:14.862
(crinkling sounds)

33:23.609 --> 33:25.706
(creature clicking)

33:40.455 --> 33:42.823
(clicking)

33:53.068 --> 33:55.703
(roars)

34:01.487 --> 34:05.046
(roars and clicks)

34:12.219 --> 34:13.721
(clicking)

34:17.125 --> 34:20.360
(clicking)

34:26.981 --> 34:28.735
She's beautiful.

34:37.846 --> 34:41.849
I envy you, your emotional
responses to things, I...

34:42.126 --> 34:44.418
I train myself out of it.

34:44.656 --> 34:46.878
But there has been a cost.

34:47.206 --> 34:51.592
Well, maybe you should
stop with the daddy routine.

34:51.775 --> 34:53.828
Let people figure it out themselves.

34:53.862 --> 34:55.596
You're right, Flynn.

34:55.862 --> 34:58.799
I can't fix you. Only you can do that.

35:00.635 --> 35:04.649
This was just after you escaped
from the Hunters in Afghanistan.

35:10.005 --> 35:12.813
You're not suicidal, Flynn. You're angry.

35:13.448 --> 35:16.052
The Hunters did something to you.

35:16.608 --> 35:18.548
And until you face it,

35:18.966 --> 35:21.322
find out what really happened,

35:21.654 --> 35:23.211
it will kill you.

35:26.452 --> 35:27.754
So who cares?

35:30.491 --> 35:31.930
Emme does.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.802
You're all she has now.

35:38.820 --> 35:42.380
Don't let the Hunters take
everything away from her, too.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.249
(truck beeping)

35:56.678 --> 35:58.262
How was Karp?

35:58.635 --> 36:00.584
His shipment's arrived.

36:00.594 --> 36:03.330
I've got everything we needed from him.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.016
What's the status on the reversion?

36:06.545 --> 36:09.026
One of Sterling's solutions was successful.

36:09.036 --> 36:12.724
You've been observing Sterling.
Can you replicate the process?

36:14.342 --> 36:16.704
Can you replicate the process without him?

36:16.714 --> 36:19.409
- Yes.
- Then you know what comes next.

36:34.694 --> 36:36.013
It's all here?

36:36.023 --> 36:39.466
Something so huge contained in these notes.

36:40.631 --> 36:41.723
Incredible.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.540
The incredible thing is our
species working together.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.984
In a few days, I have accomplished
what no other human scientist

36:46.994 --> 36:50.788
could even dream of. Imagine what
we can learn from one another.

36:50.798 --> 36:53.930
Humans would never accept
us. They see us as monsters.

36:53.940 --> 36:56.750
You're not monsters, not to me.

36:57.415 --> 37:01.188
Not anymore. You're just trapped
in a skin that doesn't fit you.

37:01.223 --> 37:03.438
In a world that just
doesn't understand you,

37:03.448 --> 37:05.451
but people can change.

37:05.916 --> 37:07.545
Yes, we can.

37:09.384 --> 37:11.398
(footsteps approaching)

37:21.009 --> 37:23.136
Tell me about your children.

37:27.993 --> 37:30.316
My girl, Mariana,

37:31.162 --> 37:32.583
she's six.

37:34.249 --> 37:36.206
She loves racing cars.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.102
Anything to do with speed.

37:41.069 --> 37:42.508
And Lucas, he...

37:43.429 --> 37:46.725
He has dark masses of curly hair

37:47.435 --> 37:48.994
and his eyes are...

37:50.416 --> 37:52.838
like two bright shining stars.

37:56.571 --> 37:58.946
(gasps)

38:00.138 --> 38:01.470
Sorry.

38:02.317 --> 38:04.652
(bones cracking)

38:18.320 --> 38:22.426
So Karp packed up his Mexican operation?

38:23.018 --> 38:24.917
We don't know where he is now.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.866
He was moving lots of stuff.

38:26.876 --> 38:29.379
Supplies, heavy duty equipment.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.869
Crazy stunt, but no infection.

38:31.879 --> 38:33.754
You are all good.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.393
Thanks, Doc.

38:35.403 --> 38:37.420
When I was at Karp's compound,

38:37.430 --> 38:40.261
I saw something being
hauled in on a giant flatbed.

38:40.271 --> 38:45.004
It was long, metallic,
cylindrical, like a submarine.

38:45.014 --> 38:46.725
It was massive.

38:47.314 --> 38:48.958
A missile?

38:48.968 --> 38:50.346
Yes.

38:50.356 --> 38:53.121
Full report on my desk by morning.

38:53.269 --> 38:55.154
I want my dad released.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.251
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain.

38:59.261 --> 39:03.031
However, I will allow
continued access to your father.

39:03.099 --> 39:06.999
He's been surprisingly cooperative
since you two have been talking.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.307
(recording of creature clicking)

39:13.496 --> 39:15.235
(lock beeps)

39:16.983 --> 39:18.230
Dad?

39:20.368 --> 39:22.097
You don't look so good.

39:22.107 --> 39:23.819
(panting)

39:24.374 --> 39:25.884
What's happened?

39:26.185 --> 39:28.491
I didn't think I'd see you again.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.322
Finnerman keeps us guessing.

39:32.582 --> 39:34.470
She came to see me.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.419
(sound recording stops)

39:36.666 --> 39:39.514
- If she hurt you...
- No, no. She...

39:40.053 --> 39:42.211
she didn't lay a hand on me.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.874
I'm fine, really, I'm just...

39:46.776 --> 39:48.197
I'm just tired.

39:52.125 --> 39:53.701
Whose body am I in?

39:56.314 --> 39:57.925
You've seen Liana.

39:59.324 --> 40:02.255
That's what happened
to your face, isn't it?

40:08.891 --> 40:11.240
Dad, tell me the truth.

40:13.407 --> 40:16.911
Where did this, me, come from?

40:19.041 --> 40:20.762
I need to know.

40:22.155 --> 40:25.414
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.

40:27.423 --> 40:30.163
Your mother found you a human skin,

40:31.156 --> 40:33.304
even though I knew what it meant...

40:33.314 --> 40:34.820
an innocent.

40:38.124 --> 40:40.564
Did it have a name?

40:41.988 --> 40:43.332
The baby?

40:45.232 --> 40:46.588
Allison.

40:47.845 --> 40:51.406
From the day you became Allison,

40:52.028 --> 40:55.558
I vowed to protect you with my life. But...

40:56.869 --> 40:58.618
I failed you.

40:58.628 --> 41:00.021
No.

41:00.031 --> 41:01.865
Yes. We should have left.

41:02.803 --> 41:04.296
Gone on the run.

41:05.642 --> 41:07.422
I'm so, so sorry.

41:08.576 --> 41:10.179
Dad, don't.

41:10.497 --> 41:13.463
You did everything you could to protect me.

41:15.477 --> 41:16.861
I always will.

41:18.541 --> 41:20.189
(clicking)

41:22.305 --> 41:24.581
(clicking continuers)

41:24.591 --> 41:26.494
I don't know what you're saying.

41:28.822 --> 41:31.043
I'm saying that I love you.

41:31.417 --> 41:35.878
(clicking)

41:39.622 --> 41:42.442
As long as I'm alive, you're in danger.

41:43.826 --> 41:47.688
- They'll use us against each other.
- Who? Finnerman? I won't let her.

41:47.698 --> 41:50.493
I couldn't protect you before, Allison.

41:52.270 --> 41:54.191
But I can now.

41:57.651 --> 41:59.142
(gasping)

41:59.152 --> 42:01.476
Dad, what have you done?

42:01.486 --> 42:02.939
(groaning)

42:04.431 --> 42:06.982
You weren't supposed to see this.

42:09.152 --> 42:10.603
You should go.

42:13.121 --> 42:14.589
Dad, no!

42:20.984 --> 42:24.733
No! Help us, someone, please help us!

42:24.990 --> 42:28.537
Protect... protect the innocent ones.

42:29.121 --> 42:30.414
No!

42:30.873 --> 42:34.075
No, Dad. Hey, stay with me, okay?

42:34.143 --> 42:36.262
You're gonna be okay. Just...

42:36.508 --> 42:38.856
Just stay with me. Stay with me, okay?

42:39.712 --> 42:41.643
Please, someone help us!
