00:05.333 --> 00:08.166
I'm Robert,
and my doctor tucked me up.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.266
The anesthesiologist comes in.
He's like,
"I have other patients.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.000
We're just gonna have to
give you your epidural"--

00:14.033 --> 00:16.333
He says, "I'll have to
give you an epidural,
and then I'm gonna leave you"?

00:16.367 --> 00:21.367
Never leave a patient unattended
after you've given them
any form of anesthesia.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.100
That is a recipe for disaster.

00:24.133 --> 00:26.600
I nearly died
from my plastic surgery.

00:26.633 --> 00:29.400
No more plastic surgery
till that's figured out?
I can't promise that.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.000
Really?
Yeah.

00:31.033 --> 00:33.000
I'm upset.
Maybe because I'm a father,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.100
and I'm relating this
to if my kids were saying this.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.100
I'd be pissed.

00:37.133 --> 00:38.300
[woman]
My face started changing.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.467
I lost fat all around my face.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.133
She went from looking like me
to looking, like,
unrecognizable.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.567
[Dr. Dubrow]
Koffa's case
is extraordinarily rare,

00:46.600 --> 00:49.233
and it may be very difficult
to fix.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.266
Mm.
You ever seen this before?

00:51.300 --> 00:54.433
Okay, this is one of
the weirdest things
I've ever seen.

00:56.433 --> 00:59.633
[male singer]
♪ I wanna be sexy ♪
[echoing]

00:59.667 --> 01:02.200
♪ I wanna be hot ♪
[echoing]

01:02.233 --> 01:05.266

Make me beautiful ♪

01:07.066 --> 01:09.400
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

01:12.233 --> 01:15.066
Okay, let's see.
That's looking good.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.533
My name is Koffa,
and I live with sarcoidosis,

01:17.567 --> 01:20.266
which has left my face
with skin and bones.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.300
And on top of that,
I have this left breast

01:22.333 --> 01:24.500
that's ready for a night out,
and then I have

01:24.533 --> 01:27.533
this right breast
that is down for the count.

01:27.567 --> 01:31.300
Sarcoidosis
is an autoimmune disease,
kind of similar to lupus.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.266
For me, it affects my skin.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.667
I was 19 years old
when my mom started noticing

01:35.700 --> 01:38.333
that around my eyes,
you could see

01:38.367 --> 01:40.667
that it was a little bit puffy,
a little bit swollen.

01:40.700 --> 01:45.667
And I did a lot of blood tests,
but the doctors did not know
what was going on.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.433
And by 2012,
my face started leaning.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.266
And it just kept going.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.166
I was just like,
"Uh, are you gonna stop?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.667
Come on now."
[chuckles]

01:54.700 --> 01:57.066
And it just end up
being like this,

01:57.100 --> 01:58.600
where I have hollow cheeks.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.567
It wasn't until 2015

02:00.600 --> 02:03.633
that a doctor
finally figured out
that I had sarcoidosis.

02:03.667 --> 02:07.200
I had an emotional breakdown.
It was really tough.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.600
I couldn't control what was
happening with my face,

02:09.633 --> 02:12.066
but I could control
the size of my boobs.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.133
At the time,
I was a bigger girl,

02:14.166 --> 02:16.500
and I was like, "I want
my breasts to match my body,"

02:16.533 --> 02:19.367
so at 29, I went ahead
and got some breasts.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.433
I thought that it
was gonna make me happy.

02:21.467 --> 02:25.066
After doing that,
I started going out on dates.
New me, baby.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.233
I thought I was hot.
You know, I was doing
a damn thing.

02:27.266 --> 02:28.600
[chuckling]

02:28.633 --> 02:31.200
And then I wake up one day
in 2015,

02:31.233 --> 02:33.233
and my left breast
is hard as a rock.

02:33.266 --> 02:36.133
So I went to the doctor,
and he told me that

02:36.166 --> 02:38.433
it was encapsulated.

02:38.467 --> 02:42.367
I'm like, "Come on, man.
Something else? Really?"

02:42.400 --> 02:44.500
So here we are,
just a couple of years later,

02:44.533 --> 02:46.633
my breasts still
are a huge issue.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.567
Both of them look different.
They need to be
on the same page.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.667
They can't be going
to different parties, listening
to different music anymore.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.667
Come on, girls.
Get it together.
[chuckles]

02:55.700 --> 02:58.266
And also my face.
I started going
to the doctors,

02:58.300 --> 03:00.333
and I've done everything
from dermarolling,

03:00.367 --> 03:02.333
putting collagen creams
on my face.

03:02.367 --> 03:04.700
Nothing's happening.
I got my angles down pat

03:04.734 --> 03:06.700
when it comes to selfies,
don't get me wrong.

03:06.734 --> 03:09.367
But sometimes
I feel like giving up.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.233
I'm tired of feeling
devastated and pissed off,
like, "Why is this happening?"

03:13.266 --> 03:16.266
Fashion is my love
and my heart.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.400
As a kid, I loved designing.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.633
I designed clothes
for my Barbies.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.500
And at that age,
I knew that's just
what I wanted to do.

03:23.533 --> 03:27.400
But after getting my doctorate
and having all these skills,
it's hard to find jobs.

03:27.433 --> 03:31.233
All seriousness, you know,
[sighs] girl,

03:31.266 --> 03:33.233
it's getting in the way

03:33.266 --> 03:35.200
of a lot of different things,
like opportunities.
Right.

03:35.233 --> 03:37.667
And then, you know,
I'll go apply for a job--
Right.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.767
...go through the interviewing
process, and then, boom,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.400
they're like,
"Oh, you know what,
your skill set is so amazing,

03:43.433 --> 03:45.367
but, you know,
we're just not gonna hire you."

03:45.400 --> 03:47.433
It has to be my appearance.

03:47.467 --> 03:50.200
It's heartbreaking,
because she actually has skill.

03:50.233 --> 03:52.433
She's really talented.
If someone just gave her a shot

03:52.467 --> 03:55.500
and looked past the exterior,
she'd be an asset.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.567
It's tough, as a friend,
hearing that.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.767
I kind of want my face
to look like yours,
you know what I'm saying?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.233
With the plumpness.
Girl, you're beautiful
inside and out.

04:02.266 --> 04:03.400
You know you're gorgeous.

04:03.433 --> 04:05.266
I wanna see Dr. Nassif

04:05.300 --> 04:07.467
and Dr. Dubrow
for my breasts and my face.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.667
I don't have an answer
for why this happened to me,

04:10.700 --> 04:13.300
but I know that they will,
more than likely,

04:13.333 --> 04:17.233
find a solution to make my life
much better than
what it is right now.

04:17.266 --> 04:19.467
Keep my fingers crossed.
[chuckling]

04:21.266 --> 04:26.200
I can't see myself living
without a corset anymore.

04:26.233 --> 04:31.233
I wear it about
23 hours a day.

04:31.266 --> 04:35.300
Makes me look more
like a sex doll,
so I really like it.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.533
I'm Amanda from Finland,

04:37.567 --> 04:40.767
and I nearly died
from my plastic surgery.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.200
My ultimate dream is to be
a real live sex doll,

04:45.233 --> 04:47.700
'cause all the womanly features

04:47.734 --> 04:51.200
are perfectly exaggerated.

04:51.233 --> 04:53.333
When I was eight or nine,

04:53.367 --> 04:56.433
I heard that there's this thing
called plastic surgery,

04:56.467 --> 04:58.333
and it can change your looks.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.433
And ever since,
I just had this feeling

05:00.467 --> 05:02.667
that when I grow up,
I would do that.

05:02.700 --> 05:06.033
In Finland, they really
don't do plastic surgery,

05:06.066 --> 05:11.367
so when I was 18,
I traveled to Estonia
to have my first boob job.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.633
Getting implants was one of
the best days of my life.

05:14.667 --> 05:18.333
But they were not
as big as I wanted.
[laughing]

05:18.367 --> 05:23.033
After my second boob job,
it became really apparent to me

05:23.066 --> 05:27.000
that I had an addiction,
'cause I realized how happy
it had made me.

05:27.033 --> 05:31.400
I would say
that having plastic surgery
is better than sex.

05:31.433 --> 05:36.033
Way better. Yeah.
[laughing]

05:36.066 --> 05:40.266
Yeah, I'm just
gonna collect myself.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.367
[clears throat]
To satisfy this addiction,

05:43.400 --> 05:45.266
I got a nose job.

05:45.300 --> 05:50.367
And then I wanted to get
1,200cc implants,

05:50.400 --> 05:54.333
so I traveled to Lithuania
to have this surgery.

05:54.367 --> 05:58.233
Afterwards,
I wake up in the ICU.

05:58.266 --> 06:02.233
I did have my surgery,
but I had had a seizure,

06:02.266 --> 06:06.300
and I had went into a coma
for several days
after my surgery.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.734
The doctors told me
it's the anesthesia
that is the problem.

06:09.767 --> 06:15.367
I was really close to dying,
but even after
the near-death experience,

06:15.400 --> 06:20.100
I'm still as addicted
as I ever were
to plastic surgery.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.633
I'm meeting Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

06:22.667 --> 06:26.567
'cause there is asymmetry
in my boobs,

06:26.600 --> 06:30.433
and obviously I want them bigger
at the same time.

06:30.467 --> 06:34.066
But I'm hoping that they could
give me surgery

06:34.100 --> 06:35.667
under local anesthesia.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.533
After my last surgery,
I'm traumatized,

06:38.567 --> 06:44.000
so the thought of being awake
is just, like, nice.

06:44.033 --> 06:47.767
I think that many people
would consider me
not very normal.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.533
And I love it when people think
that I'm crazy.

06:50.567 --> 06:54.300
When people tell me that
I'm gonna regret my surgeries,

06:54.333 --> 06:57.000
well, that just sounds
really silly to me.

06:57.033 --> 07:00.000
Why would I regret big boobs?

07:07.567 --> 07:09.734
Why do you always make fun
of me and say, "Hey, everybody"?

07:09.767 --> 07:12.066
Well, because when you do
these Internet posts--
Hey, everybody.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.734
...you can't decide whether
you wanna do, "Hi, everybody,"
Hey, everybody.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.567
or "Hey, everybody,"
so you sort of blur them.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.633
You go, "Har, everybody."
Do I say it like that?

07:19.667 --> 07:22.433
Or I go, "Hi, everybody?"
You go, "Har, everybody."

07:22.467 --> 07:24.600
How about this?
Hi, everybody.
That's it.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.600
What is that?
Is that "hey" or "hi"?
That was "hi."

07:26.633 --> 07:28.033
Do it again.
Hi, everybody.

07:28.066 --> 07:30.433
That one was
"Har, everybody."

07:30.467 --> 07:31.734
Which is it?
Does it really
sound like that?

07:31.767 --> 07:33.467
It does.
Heh, everybody.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.133
No, it's "Har, everybody."
Har...
Har...

07:36.166 --> 07:39.500
[both laughing]

07:39.533 --> 07:41.166
Hey, Terry,
can you understand this?

07:41.200 --> 07:43.400
Kiss my butt.
[laughing]

07:43.433 --> 07:47.700
We have a patient
that's gonna need both
of our expertise, okay?

07:47.734 --> 07:50.133
This is Koffa.
Mm-hmm.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.734
This is what Koffa
used to look like.
Okay.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.700
This is what Koffa
looks like right now.
Oh, boy.

07:55.734 --> 07:58.533
Lost all of her facial fat.
Lost all of her facial fat.

07:58.567 --> 08:00.100
Okay? In addition,

08:00.133 --> 08:01.467
look at Koffa's breasts.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.567
Is that capsular contracture?
Yeah.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.367
Can you please send in Koffa?

08:07.734 --> 08:10.367
Hi.
Koffa, hi.
Dr. Nassif.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.700
Nice to meet you.
Hi, Koffa. Terry Dubrow.

08:11.734 --> 08:13.467
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.333
[Koffa]
I'm tired of looking like this,

08:15.367 --> 08:18.433
so I hope that
I can get some good news.

08:18.467 --> 08:20.633
[Dr. Dubrow]
You've got some unique problems,

08:20.667 --> 08:23.100
and I can only imagine
how they've affected you.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.166
So, tell us about this.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.667
I was about 19 years old.
My face started changing.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.100
My eyes actually
were swollen first.

08:31.133 --> 08:36.200
Then from 2010 to 2013,
all of it just started
going away.

08:36.233 --> 08:40.133
So it started out swollen.
Edematous.
Yeah, it was-- Mm-hmm.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.500
And then-- Okay.
So inflammatory.

08:42.533 --> 08:46.667
So they did new tests,
and then they were like,
"You have sarcoidosis."

08:46.700 --> 08:51.533
Sarcoidosis
is an inflammatory process
of the body,

08:51.567 --> 08:53.767
and most people
don't have symptoms.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.200
Unlike Koffa's situation,
where all the fat
is gone in her face.

08:57.233 --> 09:00.734
She went from looking like me
to looking, like,
unrecognizable.

09:00.767 --> 09:03.467
And she would just
lock herself in her house.
She'd work from home.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.133
She got her PhD from home.
She did everything from home.
Really?

09:06.166 --> 09:08.667
She feels like people look
at her like a science project.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.033
And people do.
They stare.

09:10.066 --> 09:11.767
Koffa has gone through hell,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.066
and she still has a smile
on her face,

09:14.100 --> 09:16.667
and she still feels like
something's gonna happen

09:16.700 --> 09:18.600
to where she'll
be back to normal.

09:18.633 --> 09:21.166
When did breast implants
fit into this process?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.133
I got the surgery in 2009.

09:23.166 --> 09:25.567
And then, in 2015,

09:25.600 --> 09:28.567
I just woke up one morning,
and my chest was hard.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.100
Just one side.
And it hurt so bad.
Yeah.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.133
But this one now
is kind of droopy,

09:33.166 --> 09:35.066
where this nipple
kind of goes down,

09:35.100 --> 09:36.633
and this one is sitting up.
Yeah.

09:36.667 --> 09:40.066
It would just be nice
to have a nice...

09:40.100 --> 09:42.567
I don't know. Rack?
Yeah.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.734
All right. So you have this,
which we have to help you with.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.600
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
And you have this,
which we have to help you with.

09:48.633 --> 09:50.633
I hate to say it,
but this is the worst case

09:50.667 --> 09:53.033
of sarcoidosis
that I've ever seen,

09:53.066 --> 09:55.200
in person
or even in a textbook.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.467
And it may be
very difficult to fix.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.567
Let's go figure it out.
Let's get in there, okay?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.600
Thank you.
Come on.

10:02.567 --> 10:05.133
It's not even so much about

As I'm touching Koffa's face,
all I can feel
is bones and muscle.

10:51.333 --> 10:55.633
The sarcoidosis has completely
destroyed her natural tissue.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.266

Let's look at the chest, okay?
[Koffa] Yes.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.667
So this side is very soft.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.367
The implant is up here,
and your breast tissue

11:10.400 --> 11:12.600
has stretched and hung down
over it.
Mm-hmm.

11:12.633 --> 11:15.700
This side is really tight,
really hard.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.633
The only thing
that's a little strange

11:17.667 --> 11:20.300
is, why is this side

This is really weird.

11:22.066 --> 11:24.066

11:24.100 --> 11:27.667
Is there scar tissue
or something else going on?

11:27.700 --> 11:30.600
All right.
I have to downsize the implant,

11:30.633 --> 11:33.166
and then figure out
what to do with the skin

11:33.200 --> 11:37.000
so that the skin isn't loose
with the smaller implants.
Okay.

11:37.033 --> 11:40.000
But I think the more
challenging situation

11:40.033 --> 11:43.133
is what Dr. Nassif
has to deal with-- the face.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.266
So, have you heard
of Sculptra?

11:46.300 --> 11:48.100
I think I've ran across that.

11:48.133 --> 11:51.600
In simplest terms,
Sculptra is a material

11:51.633 --> 11:54.400
you inject in the face,
basically creating

11:54.433 --> 11:58.100
new collagen,
which means more fullness,
volume.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.734
In addition, we can put
some long-acting fillers in.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.400

Yes.

or it can last up to a year.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You're gonna get
your groove back, girl.
Oh, my God.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.667
I literally
never leave my house
without my shapewear on.

12:34.700 --> 12:38.033
I wear 'em
underneath everything,
because they're spandex.

everything into place.

I'm Robert,
I'm from San Jose, California,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.100
and my doctor tucked me up.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.667
My stomach is disgusting.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.467
It is flabby.
It hangs over on the sides.

12:49.500 --> 12:54.100
And I'd rather have a dad bod
than this sad bod.
[chuckles]

12:54.133 --> 12:57.233
Life as a kid was good,
but we struggled with money.

12:57.266 --> 12:59.333
There was never really
too many home-cooked meals.

12:59.367 --> 13:03.367
It was whatever was
convenient and cheap.
It was always fast food.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.333
At my heaviest weight
in college,
I weighed in around 400 pounds.

13:06.367 --> 13:09.000
At age 22,
I joined weight-loss programs

13:09.033 --> 13:11.400
that would show me
how to eat properly.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.233
And I was working out
twice a day.

13:13.266 --> 13:16.133
In five years, I ended up
losing over 200 pounds.

13:16.166 --> 13:20.133
After losing all the weight,
unfortunately it left me
with a bunch of loose skin

13:20.166 --> 13:22.467
that was nasty
and I couldn't really hide.

13:22.500 --> 13:26.000
Looking for my doctor
for the surgery,
I went on Yelp.

13:26.033 --> 13:29.433
He had a really good price.
And I called and made
my consultation.

13:29.467 --> 13:32.233
Having the skin surgery removal
was gonna finally
give me the chance

13:32.266 --> 13:34.667
to be proud of all
the hard work I put in.

13:34.700 --> 13:38.734
Coming out of surgery,
right away, I knew
my stomach was just [bleep].

13:38.767 --> 13:42.500
My sides were bulging over.
I had this crease
down the center.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.133
I had love handles
that I didn't have before.

13:45.166 --> 13:48.333
This whole year,
since having my tummy tuck,
has been pretty rough.

13:48.367 --> 13:51.133
I wear shapers constantly,
every day now,

13:51.166 --> 13:53.767
'cause my love handles
are sticking out of my clothes.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.367
It causes me to not want to
open up or date anybody

13:57.400 --> 14:01.233
in fear of them finding out
I'm wearing a shaper.

14:01.266 --> 14:03.300
Hope I find
something here.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.066
One time I was dancing
in a club, and some guy

14:06.100 --> 14:09.300
came up to me
and started dancing with me,
and he felt my shaper,

14:09.333 --> 14:13.166
and it was the most embarrassing
thing I've ever
actually gone through.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.367
We still danced,
but I slowly made my way
towards the door.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.734
Don't judge me.
I won't judge you.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.433
Look at that.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.100
It's disgusting.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.100
Does it go
all the way back?
Yeah.

14:24.133 --> 14:27.033
There's, like,
wrinkles right there.
Like, it's just not smooth.

14:27.066 --> 14:31.033
I definitely think
it took Robert
a lot to show me that,

14:31.066 --> 14:34.767
because he does hide a lot,
even from his closest friends.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So I feel for him more,

14:37.033 --> 14:40.133
and I understand why
he wants to do the surgery.

14:40.166 --> 14:43.266
I wanna be able to go out there
and meet someone

14:43.300 --> 14:45.233
and not be worried
by them hugging me.

14:45.266 --> 14:47.033
I wanna be me.
I wanna look good.

14:47.066 --> 14:50.100
The fact that I have to hold
back so much all the time--

14:50.133 --> 14:52.200
it bothers me, makes me mad,
because sometimes

14:52.233 --> 14:54.500
I put myself in situations
where I really wished

14:54.533 --> 14:56.500
I had a joke,
or I would say something funny
in my head,

14:56.533 --> 14:58.500
and I'm like, "I wish
I could've said that out loud."

14:58.533 --> 15:01.433
But it's kind of like,
I'd rather just be quiet

15:01.467 --> 15:06.467
and not looked at
and almost forgotten.
[sniffles]

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
Having the surgery
would mean the world to me.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.367
It would be incredible
to start over with a new body.

these squats yesterday.

an important lesson today.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.533
Oh, my butt!

16:07.567 --> 16:10.066
Never ask a pain in your butt

a pain in your butt.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.400
Okay, our next patient,
Robert,

16:14.433 --> 16:16.633
gained a lot of weight
and then lost it.

16:16.667 --> 16:20.633
But he had
some cosmetic surgery
to fix the skin.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.567
Look at this.
Is that a butt?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.300
No, that's his abdomen now.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.033
Can you please
send in Robert?

16:28.033 --> 16:30.433

Nice to meet you.

So you lost a whole bunch
of weight, and, of course,

16:37.467 --> 16:41.100
that wreaked havoc
on your skin.
Yes.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.066
It made your skin loose.
Yeah.
Yeah. Absolutely.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.567
The stomach area
just hung a lot right here.
Yeah.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.600
There was nothing I could do.
So I found a doctor on Yelp.
Okay.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.633
He tells me, "Come in
a little bit earlier,

16:51.667 --> 16:53.633
and we'll do the markings
before your surgery."

16:53.667 --> 16:56.300
But the doctor
ends up calling in late.

16:56.333 --> 16:59.600
The anesthesiologist comes in.
He's like,
"I have other patients.

16:59.633 --> 17:02.166
"We're just gonna have to
give you your epidural.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.400
Your doctor will be here soon."

17:04.433 --> 17:07.166
He says, "I'll have to
give you an epidural,
and then I'm gonna leave you"?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.066
One of the most important
never-to-do things

17:10.100 --> 17:15.500
is leave a patient unattended
after you've given them
any form of anesthesia.

17:15.533 --> 17:17.533
That is a recipe for disaster.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.667
[Robert]
Right when I woke up,
I could see

17:19.700 --> 17:22.300
that my sides were bigger
than the wrapping.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.333
And then, also,
I had a deep line

17:25.367 --> 17:27.333
in the center.
Yeah, we saw that
in the picture.

even so much about

but if I can have Dr. Dubrow
do that for me,
that's way easier.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.700
It's important to understand
that a tummy tuck,

18:50.734 --> 18:54.333
of all
the plastic surgery procedures
there are, that we do,

18:54.367 --> 18:56.600
that's the number one
riskiest procedure.

18:56.633 --> 19:00.233
Because when you tighten
the abdominal wall,

19:00.266 --> 19:02.200
you're squeezing off the veins,

19:02.233 --> 19:05.734
and when you do that,
the chance of getting
a blood clot is elevated.

19:05.767 --> 19:09.333
Tummy tucks in men--
they're even higher risk,

19:09.367 --> 19:11.467
because there's
a greater surface area

19:11.500 --> 19:15.433
and much more of a chance
that there will be
postoperative bleeding,

19:15.467 --> 19:18.734
or postoperative
fluid formation,
called a "seroma."

20:09.433 --> 20:11.500
Sounds nice.
[chuckles]
Then we'll get this...

20:11.533 --> 20:13.533
I can definitely say
it's a dream job,

20:13.567 --> 20:15.533
modeling for
a sex doll company.

20:15.567 --> 20:19.367
I'm probably gonna be comparing
myself to the dolls.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.300
Like, how far away from the goal
am I right now?

20:30.433 --> 20:32.700
Now that I see them,
they look pretty big,

20:32.734 --> 20:34.533
but I still want them bigger.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.533
I think they
are huge already.
I understand.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.033
No, you don't.
I understand that.

20:39.066 --> 20:42.700
But what if the doctors
would agree to do my boobs?

20:42.734 --> 20:45.600
I just hope that you
don't do anything stupid,

20:45.633 --> 20:50.066
'cause I don't really like
the idea that you might die.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.533
I'm afraid of dying as well.
[chuckles]

20:52.567 --> 20:55.433
And you think that's
not a reason to quit?

20:55.467 --> 20:58.300
You've seen that nothing
gets me more excited

20:58.333 --> 21:00.100
than planning a surgery.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.500
It's just the thing in life
that makes me happiest.

21:03.533 --> 21:06.633
Yeah. But I think
that's not healthy.

21:06.667 --> 21:10.600
I hope the doctors
will say to Amanda

21:10.633 --> 21:13.567
that it's not safe
to get any more surgeries.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.400
Oh, my gosh.
I think they look bigger here

21:16.433 --> 21:19.533
than what I see
in the mirror.
Yeah.

21:19.567 --> 21:21.300
[Amanda]
Seeing the mold
made me realize

21:21.333 --> 21:24.300
that my boobs
do look pretty big,

21:24.333 --> 21:28.333
but that doesn't stop me
from wanting them
double the size.

21:28.367 --> 21:30.400
Which one do you prefer?

21:30.433 --> 21:32.066
I'll take the left one.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.000
[laughing]
Your left?

21:34.033 --> 21:35.500
[man laughing]

21:39.500 --> 21:41.700
[Koffa]
I have to touch these bones
one more good time,

21:41.734 --> 21:43.734
'cause these bones--

21:43.767 --> 21:45.734
you're gonna be gone.
[chuckles]

21:45.767 --> 21:49.600
'Cause it's time
for juicy face again.
Juicy face.

21:49.633 --> 21:51.467
Koffa.
[Koffa]
Hi.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.734
How are you?
Hi. Nice to see you.

21:52.767 --> 21:54.567
Good to see you.
How you doing, young lady?

21:54.600 --> 21:57.500
So, this is my anesthesiologist,
Dr. Mest.

21:57.533 --> 22:02.667
He's the world specialist
in this facial filling
process for you.
Yeah.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.734
I mean, he's the guy
who got the stuff FDA approved.

22:05.767 --> 22:07.367
Okay?
I'm excited.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.133
I'm super excited
to help you out.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.633
Living with sarcoidosis
is very challenging.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.467
My face is skin and bones.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.066
So I'm just curious to see
what I'm gonna look like.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.467
So, Koffa, what's nice
about this, you have
some immediate filling--

22:20.500 --> 22:22.433
Mm-hmm.
...with the hyaluronic acids.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.467
And the long term--
basically, your body

22:24.500 --> 22:27.700
producing your own collagen,
from Sculptra.
Mm.

22:27.734 --> 22:30.166
Injecting Koffa,
we can definitely
feel the damage

22:30.200 --> 22:32.200
that the sarcoidosis has done.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.467
Usually, when you put in
a needle and inject,

22:34.500 --> 22:36.400
the needle goes back
and forth real easy.

22:36.433 --> 22:38.767
However, with Koffa,
the needle is not flexible,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.767
and there's a lot of ridges
on the cheek.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.533
These are all signs
of some inflammatory process

22:44.567 --> 22:47.500
that has occurred
in Koffa's face.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.633
Smile for me.
And this is just the beginning.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.767
That's just the beginning.
Wow!

22:52.000 --> 22:53.633
You look fantastic.
I'm gonna pass you off

22:53.667 --> 22:55.066
to Dr. Dubrow now.
Okay.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.633
Great. Right. Huh?
Okay. I'm out.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.400
Thanks for coming down.
Appreciate it.

22:58.433 --> 23:00.400
Do, as usual,
a great job as you always do.

23:00.433 --> 23:02.133
I will--
I will do my best.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.633
[Dr. Dubrow]
For Koffa's surgery today,
I'll begin on her left breast

23:09.667 --> 23:13.500
by making an incision
in her areola,
and remove the old implant.

23:13.533 --> 23:17.133
Then I'll remove
the scar tissue,
insert a new, smaller implant,

23:17.166 --> 23:19.066
and tighten
her breast envelope.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.667
Next, I'll make an incision
under her right areola,

23:21.700 --> 23:24.667
remove the old implant,
and insert a smaller implant.

23:24.700 --> 23:28.166
I'll then downsize the pocket
and reduce
the right skin envelope

23:28.200 --> 23:32.767
to fix the dissociation,
ultimately giving her
natural, symmetrical breasts.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.433
Let's get to it.

23:34.467 --> 23:36.166
So we're gonna start
on the left side

23:36.200 --> 23:38.734
and figure out why
this breast is so big.

23:38.767 --> 23:43.033
This is definitely
one of those cases
you expect the unexpected.

23:43.066 --> 23:45.266
All right. We're about to get
into the capsule here.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.233
If there's fluid,
it'll come out now.

23:47.266 --> 23:50.133
Whoa, what is that?

23:50.166 --> 23:52.000
Old hematoma.
Old blood.

23:52.033 --> 23:53.567
Wow.
It's old blood.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.133
She had a hematoma.
Look at that.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.066
Oh.
Oh, my God.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.433
[Dr. Dubrow]
Normally, when you
make an incision,

23:59.467 --> 24:01.633
you see soft tissue,

24:01.667 --> 24:03.700
then scar tissue,
then the implant.

24:03.734 --> 24:06.700
It's very unusual
to see blood,

24:06.734 --> 24:10.500
the type of which I'm seeing
in Koffa's breast pocket.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.433
And there's a lot of bad things
that can cause that.

24:13.467 --> 24:15.100
What is this?
Ugh!

24:15.133 --> 24:16.567
That's not just clot.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.567
That's spongy, weirdness.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.200
What is this stuff?
Ugh.

24:20.233 --> 24:22.600
Have you ever
seen this before?

24:22.633 --> 24:25.300
Okay, this is one of
the weirdest things
I've ever seen.

24:27.100 --> 24:32.000
I remember waking up
in ICU several days later.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.600
In the intensive care unit?
Yeah. I was in a coma.

24:34.633 --> 24:36.633
You were in a coma
after plastic surgery?
Yeah.

24:36.667 --> 24:39.033
That's very rare,
and it may indicate

24:39.066 --> 24:43.000
something really significant
is going on in Amanda's body.

What is that?

24:53.166 --> 24:55.600
We've gotta send this out
for pathology.
Yeah.

24:55.633 --> 24:57.233
Here. Let's take
this implant out.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.734
Ugh!

25:01.767 --> 25:04.300
Based on what I'm seeing now,

25:04.333 --> 25:08.700
I think it's better if Koffa
never deals with
breast implants again.

25:08.734 --> 25:12.033
With cases that are
extraordinarily unique,

25:12.066 --> 25:17.300
the exact surgical plan
will vary according
to what we find during surgery.

25:17.333 --> 25:20.200
Okay, let's do the right side
and see what's going on.

25:20.233 --> 25:22.166
See? Here it is.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.333
Look at that.
Totally normal.

25:24.367 --> 25:27.166
Okay, so we're just gonna
leave the implant
out of this side,

25:27.200 --> 25:29.367
let them change, hopefully,
relatively equally.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.700
And then, until
we have a diagnosis,

25:31.734 --> 25:35.300
we can't even consider
doing anything more definitive
than what we're doing.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.700
Okay. Thank you very much.

25:37.734 --> 25:40.200
What's so surprising with Koffa
is what I thought was

25:40.233 --> 25:42.300
garden-variety
capsular contracture--

25:42.333 --> 25:44.200
it turns out it wasn't.

25:44.233 --> 25:48.734
It's just a lot of foreign
material and old blood.

25:48.767 --> 25:51.100
So we're just gonna have to wait
till that's analyzed

25:51.133 --> 25:54.066
to figure out what to do next.

Okay, we have a patient
from overseas.
Her name is Amanda Ahola.

26:01.233 --> 26:05.200
She has very large
breast implants,
but she has issues with them.

26:05.233 --> 26:07.066
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

26:07.100 --> 26:10.200
So, they're a bit uneven,
one's higher than the other,

the areolas way out.

your history, that you've had
some breast surgery, obviously.

You've had three
breast surgeries?
Yeah.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.734
What size
were put in initially?

27:35.767 --> 27:37.367
Four hundred sixty cc's.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.767
They were so tiny!

27:40.000 --> 27:42.133
What size bra did that
take you to?

27:42.166 --> 27:44.000
I think it was an E cup.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.133
So what size was your
goal size, ultimately?

27:46.166 --> 27:49.000
One thousand four hundred cc's.
Fourteen hundred in each side?

27:49.033 --> 27:51.300
Yeah.
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,
that gets "wow."

27:51.333 --> 27:55.367
In this country, the largest
we really ever put in is 800.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.400
Fourteen hundred,
even on someone
twice the size of Amanda,

27:59.433 --> 28:04.433
is going to subject her
to a lot of complications,
and is far too big.

28:04.467 --> 28:07.033
And then what did you
tell the surgeon
the second time?

28:07.066 --> 28:11.066
As big as you can go,
but he only put 750.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.233
What size was your bra
after 750?
H.

Okay. You're going
way down the alphabet now.
Yeah.

what was the goal
with the next breast surgery?

28:19.200 --> 28:22.533
Well, I meet
this guy online,

28:22.567 --> 28:24.533
and we just started talking

28:24.567 --> 28:27.066
about, you know,
he was into big boobs.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.767
So I always like to chat
with people who have
similar interests.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.500
And then he was like,
"Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

28:34.533 --> 28:38.200
And I was like,
"Well, I do want bigger boobs."

28:38.233 --> 28:41.467
Okay. Were you aware
of this going on, Aleksi?

28:41.500 --> 28:43.300
[both]
Yeah.
Were you cool with this?

28:43.333 --> 28:45.367
Of course not. I mean--
You were okay with it?
Yeah. Yeah.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.734
Wait a minute. You guys
are boyfriend-girlfriend.
[both] Yeah.

28:47.767 --> 28:52.333
But the guy was from the US,
so I was okay with that.
Yeah.

28:52.367 --> 28:55.066
So he sugar-daddy'd you
some breast implants.
Yeah.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.066
Yeah.
Yes.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.734
I love my boyfriend, Aleksi,

28:57.767 --> 29:00.100
but the love of my life
is plastic surgery.

29:00.133 --> 29:01.533

29:01.567 --> 29:04.333
between plastic surgery
and Aleksi,

29:04.367 --> 29:07.200
I would obviously choose
plastic surgery.

29:07.233 --> 29:09.533
And he knows that.

29:09.567 --> 29:12.133
So, I had the surgery.

29:12.166 --> 29:17.400
And then I remember waking up
in ICU several days later.

29:17.433 --> 29:20.266
In the intensive care unit?
Yeah. I was in a coma. Yeah.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.433
You were in a coma
after plastic surgery?
Yeah.

29:22.467 --> 29:24.500
What happened?
I had a seizure--

29:24.533 --> 29:26.567
Yeah?
...and then they took me

29:26.600 --> 29:30.033
to a bigger hospital
after that.
Wow.

29:30.066 --> 29:32.100
So, you got close to--
Dying.

29:32.133 --> 29:33.533
...dying.
Yeah.

29:33.567 --> 29:36.333
If a patient goes into a coma
postoperatively,

29:36.367 --> 29:38.400
that's very rare,
and it may indicate

29:38.433 --> 29:42.433
something really significant
is going on in Amanda's body.

29:42.467 --> 29:44.367
So what are your goals
with your breasts?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.100
The number one thing
is that

29:46.133 --> 29:48.500
this breast
is more in the middle--

29:48.533 --> 29:50.200
Ahh. Okay.
...than this one.

29:50.233 --> 29:52.300
It's-- They're asymme--
You know.
Yes.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.333
Asymmetric.
Yeah. Asymmetric.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.000
So, you wanna
make them more even--

29:56.033 --> 29:58.433
Yeah, and sadly,
I still want them bigger.
Ugh!

29:58.467 --> 30:02.100
How much bigger?
One thousand six hundred.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.000
But I never go in
under anesthesia again.

30:05.033 --> 30:08.500

but under local anesthesia.
Yeah.

30:08.533 --> 30:11.333

jumping into the water,"

six white sharks all the time,

30:37.333 --> 30:40.033

on the side, on the edge of the
boat, and just keep watching.

30:53.667 --> 30:56.734
[Dr. Dubrow]
Okay, so let's look
at your breasts.

30:56.767 --> 31:00.233
This one is a little higher,
pushing the implant up higher.
Yeah. Yeah.

31:00.266 --> 31:02.367
This is lower,
allowing it to sit lower.
Yeah.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.300
So there is an asymmetry.

31:04.333 --> 31:07.633
So, yes, a surgical procedure
could be done

31:07.667 --> 31:11.700
to make them more symmetrical
and make them larger.

31:11.734 --> 31:15.133
But the main issue
with you is,

31:15.166 --> 31:17.400
if you have
a physiologic disorder,

31:17.433 --> 31:20.433
it's from
the stress of surgery.

31:20.467 --> 31:23.133
Yeah. I know. Yeah.
Not from local,
not from general.

31:23.166 --> 31:26.600
It's the stress
of the operation itself.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.734
That's what's going on
with you.

31:28.767 --> 31:32.166

till that's figured out?
I can't promise that.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.400
Really?
Yeah.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.300
What really concerns me
about Amanda

31:35.333 --> 31:37.633
is that clearly
she may be a patient

31:37.667 --> 31:40.700
who has a form
of plastic surgery addiction,

31:40.734 --> 31:43.567
and it's something
we need to look very closely at.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.333
So, are you gonna--
you gonna ride on her

31:46.367 --> 31:48.533

I can't stop her,

very bad about that, but--

Maybe because I'm a father,

to if my kids were saying this.
Yeah.

this worked up over a patient.

"Well, I'll take

Good advice.

32:55.033 --> 32:56.600

32:58.567 --> 33:01.233
[chuckling]

33:05.233 --> 33:07.700
Robert, how are you, my man?
Good. How are you?

33:07.734 --> 33:09.467
It's good to see you.
Good to see you too.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.600
Now, most tummy tucks

33:11.633 --> 33:13.767
are stretched-out skin

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
in the vertical direction.

33:16.033 --> 33:18.633
So that if you just
tighten it this way,
you're done.
Yeah.

33:18.667 --> 33:21.633
You have vertical laxity
and horizontal laxity.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.533
[mutters]
Which means, you know,
an incision down the middle.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.467
How do you feel about
having a scar down

33:26.500 --> 33:28.300
the center of your abdomen?
I don't mind it.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.467
Well, that says it all
right there.
That's your answer.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.266
All right.
That's cool.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.367
I'll begin Robert's surgery
by placing him on his left side
to do a flankplasty.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.567
I will make an incision
around his side,
all the way to his back,

33:44.600 --> 33:46.767
and remove excess skin
on his right flank,

33:47.000 --> 33:48.667
and then turn him
on his right side

33:48.700 --> 33:51.500
and repeat the procedure
on his left flank,

33:51.533 --> 33:54.000
tightening his waistline
to improve his contour.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.000
Next, I'll turn him
onto his back,

33:56.033 --> 33:59.533
where I'll make both
a horizontal
and vertical incision,

33:59.567 --> 34:02.500
removing excess skin
to tighten his abdominal area,

34:02.533 --> 34:05.266
ultimately giving him
an all-around better shape.

34:05.300 --> 34:09.533
So, we're gonna start
Robert's case today with
what's called a "flankplasty."

34:09.567 --> 34:11.700
We turn him
on his left side down

34:11.734 --> 34:14.000
in order that we focus
on his right side.

34:14.033 --> 34:17.300
So let's go ahead
and make an incision

34:17.333 --> 34:20.734
all the way to his back.

34:20.767 --> 34:25.633
Robert has so much laxity
that it extends
all the way to the back.

34:25.667 --> 34:28.533
So we call that
a "belt lipectomy,"

34:28.567 --> 34:32.367
where it's as if a belt,
surrounding the entire
abdominal wall,

34:32.400 --> 34:34.567
is placed to tighten skin.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.300
See ya.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.300
The ultimate shapewear.
Shapewear with a scalpel.

34:40.333 --> 34:44.667
So look at that. That's
gonna be his new waistline.
Looks nice.

34:44.700 --> 34:49.367
Now we're gonna open up
his previous
tummy tuck incision.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.500
Ah. What is that?
Yeah.

34:51.533 --> 34:53.300
Multiple metal clips.

34:53.333 --> 34:56.567
Who the hell uses clips
in plastic surgery
on the inside?

34:56.600 --> 34:58.633
Look at this.
I promise you,

34:58.667 --> 35:01.500
this guy was not
a plastic surgeon.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.367
The problem with metal clips is,
it's really something
you tend to use

35:04.400 --> 35:07.700
inside the abdomen,
not in the abdominal wall,

35:07.734 --> 35:11.033
because it's a lot
of metallic foreign body,

35:11.066 --> 35:14.633
and you'd rather not have that
on the outside of the abdomen.

35:14.667 --> 35:16.467
Here we go.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.600
Look how much laxity there is
in this direction.
Uh-huh.

35:19.633 --> 35:22.500
Wow. All right.
Let's try this.

35:22.533 --> 35:25.567
It's basically
a sideways tummy tuck.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.600
We don't see that every day.
No.

35:27.633 --> 35:31.066
Robert's had so much weight loss

35:31.100 --> 35:33.000
and so much loose skin

35:33.033 --> 35:35.767
that requires you
to do something
a little extraordinary.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.667
That's nice.
That looks good.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.700
Huh?
Looks good.

35:38.734 --> 35:39.700
Yeah.
That's tight.

35:39.734 --> 35:41.667
But when that loosens up,

35:41.700 --> 35:43.467
that should be good.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.400
Let's close, and let's
get him to a recovery room.

35:45.433 --> 35:47.633
Yeah? Awesome.
Great.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.767
[Koffa laughing]

35:55.000 --> 35:57.467
Oh, my goodness.
It's about time.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.367
I know.
[laughing]

35:59.400 --> 36:01.100
Thankfully,
Koffa's biopsy came back

36:01.133 --> 36:02.767
with nothing
but coagulated blood.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.567
And that's a benign finding,

36:04.600 --> 36:07.100
so we're able
to go ahead with the surgery.

36:07.133 --> 36:12.500
But Koffa had
a very unusual reaction
to her breast implants,

36:12.533 --> 36:16.767
and it's a better idea
to completely avoid
breast implants,

36:17.000 --> 36:21.367
because putting them back in
may set us up
for a real problem.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.633
So, the key with you
is to get these up,

36:24.667 --> 36:29.100
get them as full-looking
as possible,
without breast implants.

36:29.133 --> 36:34.066
It is disappointing to know
that my body is doing
all kind of whacky stuff,

36:34.100 --> 36:36.633
but after getting
the information
from the doctors,

36:36.667 --> 36:42.100
I just decided my health
is way more important
than the vanity of my breasts.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.533
All right. So, let's
make this the final step--

36:45.567 --> 36:47.467
Yes! Oh, my gosh!
...in your process.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.033
You've been through a lot.
Yes.
[laughing]

36:50.066 --> 36:51.600
Don't you love her?
Oh, my gosh!

36:51.633 --> 36:53.567
[woman]
She's the best.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.533
Okay, step one:

36:58.567 --> 37:00.567
removal of the breast skin.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.233
So now that we've taken
her breast apart,

37:03.266 --> 37:05.000
we have to put it
back together again

37:05.033 --> 37:07.166
and try to make
a breast shape out of it.

37:07.200 --> 37:11.667
My goal today
is to give Koffa round,
aesthetically pleasing breasts.

37:11.700 --> 37:15.467
So, as opposed to maximizing
projection using implants,

37:15.500 --> 37:18.700
I have to minimize the width
to give the proper balance.

37:18.734 --> 37:22.533
So, to bring the width down,
I need to tighten the side

37:22.567 --> 37:24.400
making this scar
a little bit longer,

37:24.433 --> 37:26.633
but I don't think
she would mind.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.633
There we go.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.233
Nice, tight out here.

37:30.266 --> 37:33.166
Good projection-to-width
balance.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.133
Okay. Let's do
the other side.

37:35.166 --> 37:38.000
It feels good to be
on the home stretch
of Koffa's surgery.

37:38.033 --> 37:40.066
It's been a long journey
for her,

37:40.100 --> 37:42.700
and I can't wait to see
what she's gonna look like
postoperatively.

37:42.734 --> 37:44.233
I think she should be
really happy with this.

37:44.266 --> 37:45.667
Okay, let's put her down.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.667
Let's close this up.
Looks good.

My boo is snatched.
Mm-hmm.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.200
I mean, damn.
A sister wouldn't mind.

39:56.233 --> 39:58.433
Right? The cute ones
are always gay.

39:58.467 --> 40:00.233
Thank you, guys, for coming.

40:00.266 --> 40:02.133
I appreciate it,
you know?

40:02.166 --> 40:05.066
[voice breaking]
Thank you for being with me.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.266
[sniffling]

40:06.300 --> 40:09.266
My mom...
[sniffling]

40:09.300 --> 40:11.033
I'm so proud of you.

40:11.066 --> 40:12.400
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

40:12.433 --> 40:14.734
You're so handsome.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.300
[Robert]
Before my surgery,
my stomach was a mess.

40:17.333 --> 40:21.100
I was square shaped,
had loose skin
and love handles.

40:21.133 --> 40:24.667
It made me so insecure
that I had to wear shapers
every single day.

40:24.700 --> 40:27.667
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
I have shape
without the shapers,

40:27.700 --> 40:29.233
and all my loose skin is gone.

40:29.266 --> 40:31.633
I finally feel like
I can break out of my shell

40:31.667 --> 40:33.433
and be that person
I was meant to be.

40:33.467 --> 40:36.200
I can finally get rid
of all of these

40:36.233 --> 40:38.200
and never have to wear them
ever again.

40:38.233 --> 40:39.767
Well, cheers to you, baby.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Whoo!
Good body!
[laughing]

40:43.033 --> 40:44.667
Baby got back.
[laughing]

40:44.700 --> 40:47.033
Thank you.
Whoo!

40:52.700 --> 40:57.000
[Koffa]
This 15-year journey
has been out of this world.

40:57.033 --> 41:00.400
I don't even know why things
happened to me
the way they did,

41:00.433 --> 41:02.500
but I'm just happy to be
where I am now.

41:02.533 --> 41:04.300
With this new face
and new body,

41:04.333 --> 41:07.266
I can walk into a room
and have confidence.

41:07.300 --> 41:09.700
I am ready to nail
that dream job.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.700
Yeah, send her in.
All right. Thanks.

41:12.734 --> 41:14.767
We have a visitor.
Remember Koffa?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.767
Yes. How could I
forget Koffa?

41:17.000 --> 41:20.166
I can't wait to see
what she looks like.
Yeah. Come in.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.033
Ah!
[Dr. Nassif]
Whoa! Look at you!

41:23.066 --> 41:25.266
No way!
Hello! Look at--

41:25.300 --> 41:27.433
[Dr. Nassif]
Wow!
Let me put these down first.

41:27.467 --> 41:29.400
Are those presents for us?
Yes.

41:29.433 --> 41:32.433
Wait. Stop. Let us just
take this in for a second.

41:32.467 --> 41:34.433
Oh, for-- Give me a hug!
[chuckling]

41:34.467 --> 41:38.100
Unbelievable!
[Dr. Nassif, Koffa]
Nice to see you.

41:38.133 --> 41:40.433
Koffa looks absolutely amazing.

41:40.467 --> 41:45.166
For the first few seconds,
I almost didn't recognize her.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.166
She looks completely different.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.233
So--
The cheeks and everything
look fantastic.

41:49.266 --> 41:51.166
...this is your old face.
Thank you. Yes.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.533
This is what you look like.
Pretty much, yes.

41:52.567 --> 41:54.433
Exactly. Right?
Uh-huh.

41:54.467 --> 41:56.734
What's happening here?
Is it good?
Everything's great.

41:56.767 --> 41:59.300
No implants.
That's right. I'm saying
you picked 'em up, did a lift.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.300
They look great.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.033
These natural-looking breasts

42:02.066 --> 42:03.400
look kind of good,
you know what I'm saying?

42:03.433 --> 42:05.700
[laughing]

42:05.734 --> 42:09.367
So I did something special,
and I hope you guys like it.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.166
Here you go.
Okay, okay, okay.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.700
Wait. Let's open 'em up
together. Ready?
Yes.

42:12.734 --> 42:15.300
One, two, three.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.300
[Dr. Nassif]
Oh, look at that.
A surgical cap.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.100
Oh, that's so cool!

42:19.133 --> 42:22.000
[Koffa]
I made surgical caps
for the doctors

42:22.033 --> 42:23.467
because they're always
in the OR,

42:23.500 --> 42:25.467
and I wanted them
to look super cute.

42:25.500 --> 42:29.066
I feel so blessed to have
the help that I had.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.767
[Dr. Dubrow]
That's the coolest thing ever!

42:32.000 --> 42:35.100
Before my surgery,
my sarcoidosis
took over my life.

42:35.133 --> 42:39.367
My face was skin and bones,
and my breasts were
completely lopsided.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.033
But now my breasts
are symmetrical,

42:42.066 --> 42:44.033
my face has regained
its fullness,

42:44.066 --> 42:46.300
I look like myself again,
and I feel great.

42:46.333 --> 42:50.266
My juicy face is back.
[laughing]

42:50.300 --> 42:53.066
I just want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.
You both changed my life.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.166
[Dr. Dubrow]
You're welcome.
You know we have

42:55.200 --> 42:57.300
thousands and thousands
of patients,

42:57.333 --> 43:01.033
and there's no way
we could remember all of them.

43:01.066 --> 43:04.400
We will never forget
you, Koffa.
Aw.

43:04.433 --> 43:06.467
Thank you.
Hold on.
Let's have a group hug.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.200
Yes.
[laughing]
Yeah.

43:09.233 --> 43:12.367
When I came out of surgery,
I said, "What the [bleep]?"

43:12.400 --> 43:15.600
My chin looked square.
It needed to be fixed ASAP.

43:15.633 --> 43:18.533
[Dr. Dubrow]
That really does look
like Kim Kardashian.

43:18.567 --> 43:21.100
No way!

43:21.133 --> 43:24.266
I have an English bulldog,
and I went down
to kiss him one day,

43:24.300 --> 43:26.100
and he came up
at the same time,

43:26.133 --> 43:29.100
so I got his tooth
through my nose.

43:29.133 --> 43:33.100
When I push on this
one direction, it will
discharge from my nipple.

43:33.133 --> 43:34.467
Every day?
Every day.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.367
I need help with these lopsided
leaking ladies.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.233
What the [bleep] is this?
