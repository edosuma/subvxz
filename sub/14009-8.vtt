00:00.898 --> 00:02.636
<i>Previously on</i> Damages...

00:02.831 --> 00:04.636
Dean Gulickson from the
<i>Times</i> called again.

00:04.758 --> 00:06.949
Thanks for agreeing
to talk to me about the case.

00:07.051 --> 00:09.884
I can give you all of
it if you do something for me.

00:09.990 --> 00:13.513
There's a High Star employee
over there-- Christopher Sanchez--

00:13.643 --> 00:16.942
and he's missing, or he's been killed.
I want you to find him.

00:17.057 --> 00:20.112
My options with you
are very limited, Chris.

00:20.206 --> 00:22.512
You betrayed me!
You talked to lawyers!

00:25.256 --> 00:28.515
Go ahead and laugh, because it's
the last thing you will ever do.

00:28.822 --> 00:30.706
His name is Gerald Boorman.

00:30.810 --> 00:32.561
And the French
government gave you his file?

00:32.677 --> 00:36.134
We may be able to pressure him
into turning against Howard Erickson.

00:36.233 --> 00:41.090
You helped Erickson cover up the
deaths of three High Star employees.

00:41.244 --> 00:42.378
We don't want you.

00:42.478 --> 00:44.916
- Well, who do you want?
- Howard Erickson.

00:45.022 --> 00:47.872
- My agency gave me time off.
- You came to see me?

00:48.032 --> 00:49.358
Jerry?

00:52.167 --> 00:53.741
You talk to Sanchez?

00:53.833 --> 00:55.340
He forced my hand.

00:57.309 --> 00:58.385
He's got to go.

"The War Will Go On Forever"

01:51.491 --> 01:53.412
There's only one
way in and out of there.

01:57.014 --> 01:58.510
There's two guards.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.650
Yeah, we'll take
'em out, no problem.

02:00.889 --> 02:03.757
Probably more
guys with guns inside.

02:03.846 --> 02:07.114
Yeah, there's a room between
the entrance and the holding cell.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.949
- How reliable is your intel?
- Solid.

02:11.151 --> 02:15.393
- Who's your source?
- Local contact. Friend of mine.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.779
Hmm.

02:23.098 --> 02:25.218
There's no cover
for the courtyard.

02:26.977 --> 02:29.366
My guys are going to be
open to sniper fire.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.850
You don't sound very confident.

02:32.229 --> 02:34.347
Well, I don't like surprises.

02:34.939 --> 02:37.090
Hell, I was under
the impression you did these

02:37.231 --> 02:39.360
snatch and grabs in your sleep.

02:43.177 --> 02:46.717
We can't lose this guy.
He's high value.

02:46.989 --> 02:51.767
Don't worry.
We'll get your guy out of there.

03:08.909 --> 03:10.424
You didn't eat again.

03:29.105 --> 03:30.387
Have it your way.

03:35.066 --> 03:37.951
- Bartkowski.
- Anything to report?

03:38.176 --> 03:39.858
No, sir.
Awaiting your orders.

03:40.103 --> 03:42.769
Listen, I need this thing
with Sanchez wrapped up quickly.

03:42.963 --> 03:46.078
Make sure you keep
Carter out of this.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.289
Those two go back a long ways.

03:48.434 --> 03:50.372
I don't want Carter to
know anything about it.

03:50.483 --> 03:52.094
Copy that. Over.

03:54.125 --> 03:57.667
If I'm going to find your
friend Sanchez, I have to get dirty.

03:57.752 --> 04:01.670
I'm not opposed to it, but if I'm
going to risk getting my ass

04:01.749 --> 04:05.039
shot up or blown up or whatever,
I need to know there's actually

04:05.143 --> 04:06.895
a story worth writing about.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.369
Like I told
you before, the CIA...

04:08.463 --> 04:11.275
No, no, no, no.
Specifics.

04:13.801 --> 04:15.879
You can't print
any of this, not yet.

04:16.010 --> 04:18.197
Of course not.

04:20.351 --> 04:22.887
The High Star
contractors who were killed...

04:22.994 --> 04:25.254
Rayburn, Franks,
Lowry-- yeah, go ahead.

04:26.895 --> 04:30.159
They didn't get ambushed
transporting kitchen supplies.

04:31.425 --> 04:36.551
They were conducting offensive operations
for the CIA and High Star knew about it.

04:37.091 --> 04:38.947
What kind of
offensive operations?

04:45.201 --> 04:48.726
Capturing terror suspects
for interrogation and rendition.

04:55.581 --> 04:57.303
And you know this for a fact?

05:00.882 --> 05:03.495
I've had two witnesses
tell me the same story.

05:04.131 --> 05:07.994
One was framed as a terrorist and deported
back to Afghanistan, and the other is...

05:08.132 --> 05:11.231
- Chris Sanchez.
- Exactly.

05:11.364 --> 05:13.640
He was on the mission
when the men were killed.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.945
I... I told you you
can't print this.

05:18.126 --> 05:22.558
No, I'm just making notes.
For my trip to Afghanistan.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.007
Hello?

05:46.922 --> 05:50.236
I told you I would come back
and get you out of here.

06:39.946 --> 06:41.404
Go, fetch.

06:46.645 --> 06:47.966
Shit.

06:49.697 --> 06:52.896
Erickson's lawyer filed a
motion to dismiss the case.

06:53.063 --> 06:54.528
Judge wants a hearing today.

06:55.234 --> 06:56.398
Can you push it back?

06:56.511 --> 06:58.884
I called the court--
the judge won't move it.

06:59.130 --> 07:00.487
We need more time.

07:01.210 --> 07:05.204
I don't have the greatest argument
to keep the case going at this point.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.530
I've lost my only two witnesses.

07:08.144 --> 07:11.510
Well, you'll have
to think of something.

07:12.094 --> 07:14.716
All I have is the
document that Herndon gave us.

07:16.809 --> 07:19.663
Would you mind coming and listening
in on the hearing today?

07:22.193 --> 07:26.091
Sure. I could be there.

07:27.953 --> 07:29.912
Ms. Parsons has had more
than enough time, and she

07:30.018 --> 07:32.614
has not produced a
speck of new evidence.

07:32.729 --> 07:34.526
Your Honor, we
obtained this document which

07:34.615 --> 07:39.118
confirms the existence of a joint CIA-High
Star operation called Dust Devil.

07:39.233 --> 07:40.536
We provided you with a copy.

07:40.650 --> 07:42.049
Yeah, I have it here.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.226
We believe Dust
Devil was the name of the

07:44.315 --> 07:46.925
illegal operation at the
heart of our claim.

07:47.044 --> 07:48.657
There's nothing illegal
about the Central Intelligence

07:48.753 --> 07:51.331
Agency doing business with
a private contractor.

07:51.449 --> 07:53.129
And what was the
nature of this business?

07:53.292 --> 07:55.429
As part of our larger
contract with the U.S. government,

07:55.531 --> 07:59.336
High Star provided security for
CIA personnel in Afghanistan.

07:59.432 --> 08:02.841
Nothing more.
It's a trivial issue.

08:02.943 --> 08:04.204
We didn't think so,
Your Honor, and through

08:04.279 --> 08:08.535
discovery we requested that High Star hand
over all documents relating to Dust Devil.

08:08.652 --> 08:11.392
- Which we did.
- Yes, but we couldn't read them.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.914
And why is that?

08:13.041 --> 08:14.509
Because they'd all been redacted.

08:14.679 --> 08:16.429
By whom?

08:16.526 --> 08:17.987
The Department of
Defense felt that the

08:18.080 --> 08:21.423
information in those documents
was vital to national security.

08:21.510 --> 08:25.958
Your Honor, they
can't have it both ways.

08:27.335 --> 08:30.673
Dust Devil can't be both trivial
and vital at the same time.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.909
It was either an
innocuous security program

08:35.047 --> 08:37.551
or it was crucial to
national interests.

08:37.881 --> 08:41.020
So which is it, Mr. Shaw?
We'd like to know.

08:41.128 --> 08:44.241
Either you're confused, or you've
just been caught in a lie.

08:45.268 --> 08:48.776
I didn't assert national
security-- the Defense Department did.

08:48.886 --> 08:50.255
In which case, Your Honor,

08:50.382 --> 08:53.237
your courtroom has been
co-opted by the Pentagon.

08:55.184 --> 08:57.428
I was thinking the same thing.

08:57.523 --> 09:01.788
Surely you can't blame High Star
for the DOD's classification protocols.

09:01.912 --> 09:05.389
I'm not interested in blame,
Mr. Shaw, I'm interested in the truth.

09:06.235 --> 09:08.694
And I would love to see
this case go forward.

09:09.634 --> 09:11.218
I am begging you, Ms. Parsons,

09:11.358 --> 09:14.164
can you give me a rationale for
denying this man's motion?

09:14.384 --> 09:17.187
I would like the
opportunity to depose Howard Erickson

09:17.275 --> 09:20.460
so I can question him about
the Dust Devil program.

09:27.351 --> 09:29.182
I think that's fair.

09:29.698 --> 09:32.576
I'd like to file a protective
order to stop the deposition.

09:32.747 --> 09:35.053
I'll tell you
what-- if you give the

09:35.146 --> 09:38.269
plaintiffs the unredacted documents,
I'll forego my ruling.

09:39.093 --> 09:40.536
That's impossible.

09:40.632 --> 09:42.937
Then your client
will be deposed.

09:46.207 --> 09:48.084
It was just dumb luck.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.785
Well, stay away from the Knicks.
You can't trust 'em.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.415
All right, now.
Yeah, you, too.

10:06.676 --> 10:08.855
You cannot be here.

10:08.979 --> 10:12.406
I told you I could find you.
I tracked you down.

10:14.057 --> 10:15.234
Why?

10:16.579 --> 10:19.373
Because my government leaked
your file to Patty Hewes.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.581
I know that.
I've already been tagged.

10:23.974 --> 10:25.533
I need you to leave.

10:25.961 --> 10:28.283
Who do you have locked upstairs?

10:28.751 --> 10:30.999
- Let's go.
- I saw him.

10:31.092 --> 10:33.433
- You what?
- It was a boy.

10:33.646 --> 10:35.073
Why do you have a boy locked up...

10:37.364 --> 10:38.658
Jerry!

10:39.208 --> 10:43.446
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

10:51.265 --> 10:53.583
The judge is ordering
you to sit for the depo.

10:54.056 --> 10:55.350
There's no way out of it.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.265
You keep telling
me they don't have a case.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.162
They don't.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.030
Then why the fuck
is this still dragging out?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.894
This judge is anti-war,
he's anti-America.

11:02.983 --> 11:05.370
He keeps giving their side
the benefit of the doubt.

11:06.127 --> 11:07.490
How many days are they talking?

11:07.590 --> 11:08.960
- Two.
- Goddamn.

11:09.048 --> 11:10.316
It's the best I could do.

11:10.409 --> 11:13.143
They're going to rake me over
the coals about Dust Devil and Sanchez.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.572
They're going to
try to get you talking.

11:15.879 --> 11:18.145
Look, I don't need to
know where Sanchez is.

11:18.238 --> 11:20.036
He signed up.
He's your employee.

11:20.136 --> 11:24.188
Afghanistan is mountainous
region full of wide open spaces.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.129
But if you're asked where he is,

11:27.225 --> 11:29.004
I want you to have
a quick answer.

11:29.541 --> 11:30.825
Of course.

11:31.095 --> 11:33.366
I'd like to set aside
some prep time this weekend.

11:33.641 --> 11:35.316
Saturday's wide open.

11:35.723 --> 11:38.281
Sunday is roped off.

11:40.225 --> 11:42.022
You taking the boys out hiking?

11:42.263 --> 11:46.643
No. It would have
been Mary-Alice's birthday.

11:48.660 --> 11:52.512
I'm sorry, Howard.
That can't be easy.

11:53.733 --> 11:55.890
The last few
birthdays have been rough.

11:58.556 --> 12:00.497
Especially on the boys.

12:01.124 --> 12:03.977
Well, I want you to know
you'll all be in my prayers.

12:05.815 --> 12:07.894
Thanks, Jack, I appreciate it.

12:16.294 --> 12:17.564
You look well, my friend.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.248
Ah. How's the family?

12:19.349 --> 12:22.628
As well as can be expected.
What can I do for you?

12:23.444 --> 12:25.018
I'm looking for someone.

12:25.316 --> 12:26.458
What clan?

12:26.559 --> 12:29.823
No, an American.
His name is Chris Sanchez.

12:30.682 --> 12:34.615
He's a High Star contractor, and I think
he's being held here against his will.

12:37.001 --> 12:38.561
You familiar with the company?

12:38.682 --> 12:41.214
Of course. They're bad news.

12:41.437 --> 12:44.614
So you think you have any
contacts inside the High Star compound?

12:45.076 --> 12:46.669
Let me see what I can find.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.519
I'll pay for any information.

13:53.524 --> 13:54.694
Erickson.

13:55.271 --> 13:56.649
The reporter is here, sir.

13:57.156 --> 13:58.615
Gulickson? He is?

13:58.720 --> 14:00.763
Affirmative.
I saw him myself.

14:00.934 --> 14:03.506
Cocksucker.
I knew he'd turn up.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.545
Nobody talks to this
prick, you got that?

14:06.645 --> 14:08.611
I don't care if he asks for
a stick of Juicy Fruit.

14:08.702 --> 14:10.912
Anybody engaging
with him gets fired.

14:11.145 --> 14:16.145
Understood, sir.
I did have one question.

14:16.752 --> 14:19.104
Should I postpone your
plan for Sanchez?

14:19.543 --> 14:24.119
No. No. I don't want
anything to get in the way of this.

14:24.342 --> 14:25.722
Copy that, sir.

14:34.137 --> 14:38.740
Shaw's going to object and try
to assert privilege at every opportunity.

14:39.088 --> 14:40.538
I'll just ignore him.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.924
Yeah, good. He's only trying to
pull focus away from Erickson.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.125
Are you going to have
a list of questions?

14:47.779 --> 14:49.211
I like to have an outline.

14:49.654 --> 14:51.228
You know, I wouldn't.

14:51.316 --> 14:53.006
You don't want to
be reading notes.

14:53.876 --> 14:58.546
You should just keep your eye
on Erickson. On his body language.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.298
I just wish I had
more to throw at him.

15:01.721 --> 15:04.943
You don't have as much
ammunition as you'd like, but

15:05.039 --> 15:07.402
that still doesn't mean
you can't score points.

15:07.872 --> 15:10.409
You know Shaw's going to have
coached him to give one-word answers.

15:10.522 --> 15:11.923
So, you push him.

15:12.423 --> 15:16.193
You ask him the same questions
ten times, ten different ways.

15:16.298 --> 15:19.359
Erickson has an ego, he'll get
tired of hearing your voice;

15:19.451 --> 15:21.279
he'll want to hear his own.

15:22.117 --> 15:26.573
Then eventually, he'll say
something he shouldn't.

15:27.064 --> 15:28.508
Like what?

15:29.354 --> 15:33.597
You never know.
That's the fun of it.

15:35.494 --> 15:37.798
Just remember we're in
the middle of a game.

15:38.710 --> 15:42.968
We don't have to win it now.
We just want to keep playing.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.817
That's it?
All they got is that document?

15:48.916 --> 15:51.535
- It seems so.
- Then you'll be fine.

15:51.678 --> 15:53.859
I'm not worried
about the deposition.

15:56.109 --> 15:59.237
It's just the timing of all
this, it really pisses me off.

15:59.342 --> 16:01.648
I wanted this week to
be about the boys.

16:03.238 --> 16:05.580
Mary-Alice's birthday
is coming up.

16:07.079 --> 16:10.163
Oh. I'm sorry, Howard.

16:11.107 --> 16:13.741
She died a day
before her birthday.

16:14.789 --> 16:16.032
I didn't realize that.

16:16.170 --> 16:20.833
Never made 47.
It'll be six years.

16:22.288 --> 16:24.234
What really bothers me is...

16:25.977 --> 16:29.284
all I can think about is
her in the hospital bed.

16:29.395 --> 16:31.644
The other stuff, the good times...

16:32.903 --> 16:35.441
it's getting harder and
harder to remember.

16:39.173 --> 16:41.281
My grandma used to say,

16:42.613 --> 16:47.390
"You always remember the
sad more than the happy."

16:47.844 --> 16:55.116
So, uh, she'd say, "Jerry,
make sure you're happy."

17:00.520 --> 17:05.320
I brought my friend.
He can tell you more about High Star.

17:09.367 --> 17:13.095
I told him you would be very
grateful for any information.

17:21.733 --> 17:24.047
Tell him about the
Afghanis who were taken.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.608
What Afghanis?

17:25.729 --> 17:29.618
High Star men would go into
villages, take away peoples.

17:29.986 --> 17:31.361
What people?
Civilians?

17:31.460 --> 17:32.455
Could be anyone.

17:32.546 --> 17:34.707
Sometimes Taliban,
sometimes farmers.

17:34.848 --> 17:37.544
One time, High Star
men make mistake.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.213
A few peoples-- killed.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.030
And when was this?

17:43.298 --> 17:48.598
- Just after planting finish
for year, it was... - October.

17:49.399 --> 17:51.490
What about Chris Sanchez?

17:52.417 --> 17:57.427
I sell cigarettes
at High Star compound.

17:57.540 --> 18:01.199
I hear name-- Sanchez.
But never see him.

18:01.311 --> 18:05.080
- And?
- This all I know.

18:11.219 --> 18:14.980
This guy sells
cigarettes to High Star employees.

18:15.108 --> 18:17.340
Just what makes you think
he can be trusted?

18:17.678 --> 18:20.172
I wouldn't bring him to you
if I didn't trust him.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.764
I need it
to look just like that.

19:34.058 --> 19:36.962
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.683
How long will
it take for you to prepare?

19:38.781 --> 19:41.634
A few days.
And who should claim credit?

19:42.325 --> 19:45.342
Local group.
Taliban, Al-Qaeda, it doesn't matter.

19:45.628 --> 19:49.379
I cannot do this alone.
I will need to find more men.

19:52.365 --> 19:56.524
Just get it done.
The target's name is Chris Sanchez.

20:12.689 --> 20:15.052
I know I've
been harsh with you.

20:22.718 --> 20:28.420
But it's only because you have
very important....

20:28.777 --> 20:30.819
Information.

20:50.035 --> 20:51.949
You like this, right?

21:08.336 --> 21:14.127
You know, the local men who took over your
region, they're lying to you, you know.

21:17.619 --> 21:20.705
They want you to believe
your mother was bad.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.805
But that's not true.

21:33.079 --> 21:35.140
She wanted peace.

21:36.683 --> 21:39.391
That's why she...
she helped my government.

21:45.383 --> 21:49.630
She was...

21:51.630 --> 21:53.523
She was my friend.

21:58.550 --> 22:02.585
You can tell me...
what the men did.

22:11.153 --> 22:13.006
Please.

22:14.279 --> 22:18.089
I want to know the truth about
what happened to your mother.

22:23.829 --> 22:25.673
<i>Dost.</i>

22:27.056 --> 22:29.389
<i>I am your friend.</i>

22:36.135 --> 22:38.950
<i>You are the devil.</i>

22:47.799 --> 22:49.782
<i>Mr. Erickson, over the
past decade, your company</i>

22:49.883 --> 22:54.119
<i>has received more contracts than any
other security firm in the world.</i>

22:54.209 --> 22:55.294
<i>Are you aware of this?</i>

22:55.615 --> 22:57.370
<i>I've been lucky
to work with good men.</i>

22:57.720 --> 22:59.740
<i>Is one of those
men Christopher Sanchez?</i>

23:00.011 --> 23:01.424
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

23:01.687 --> 23:03.040
<i>I'm curious, Mr.
Erickson.</i>

23:03.124 --> 23:05.636
<i>At the end of last year,
Congress was all set to not</i>

23:05.767 --> 23:08.370
<i>renew your contracts, but
that didn't happen, did it?</i>

23:08.506 --> 23:12.032
<i>No.
The vote ended up going my way.</i>

23:12.478 --> 23:15.419
<i>Any guess as to what may have
changed their minds at the last minute?</i>

23:16.127 --> 23:19.447
<i>Politicians.
Who can figure 'em out?</i>

23:21.957 --> 23:23.767
<i>Are you aware Mr.
Sanchez was going to be a</i>

23:23.868 --> 23:26.150
<i>witness for the
plaintiffs in this case?</i>

23:26.404 --> 23:28.126
<i>I'd heard that.</i>

23:28.746 --> 23:32.400
<i>He wound up signing a contract
with my company to redeploy.</i>

23:32.503 --> 23:33.868
<i>Yes, and the day
after he redeployed,</i>

23:33.967 --> 23:36.293
<i>Congress decided to
renew your contracts.</i>

23:36.797 --> 23:38.797
<i>Does that seem like a
coincidence to you?</i>

23:39.174 --> 23:41.698
<i>Now that you mention
it, I guess it does.</i>

23:42.410 --> 23:45.349
<i>Your company has experienced
a remarkable rise, Mr. Erickson.</i>

23:45.446 --> 23:46.144
<i>What's your secret?</i>

23:46.246 --> 23:48.729
<i>Objection. You're not here to
get business tips from my client.</i>

23:48.818 --> 23:49.713
<i>In a short period of time</i>

23:49.790 --> 23:51.869
<i>you've gone from being a career
Marine to the CEO of one</i>

23:51.965 --> 23:54.678
<i>of the most wildly profitable
companies in the Fortune 500.</i>

23:55.789 --> 23:57.220
<i>What's the secret
to your success?</i>

23:57.320 --> 24:00.707
<i>- Objection.
- I'll put it differently.</i>

24:00.802 --> 24:03.563
<i>Why have your profits risen by
200% in the last five years?</i>

24:03.684 --> 24:06.659
<i>Elbow grease and sweat.</i>

24:06.795 --> 24:08.121
<i>That's the only reason?</i>

24:09.686 --> 24:12.148
<i>Success breeds success,
my daddy used to say.</i>

24:12.241 --> 24:13.737
<i>Well, your daddy
was in refrigeration.</i>

24:13.858 --> 24:16.752
<i>In your profession, war breeds
success, isn't that right?</i>

24:16.965 --> 24:18.274
<i>Just because
there's a war, doesn't</i>

24:18.356 --> 24:20.083
<i>automatically mean
I make a profit.</i>

24:20.171 --> 24:21.594
<i>My company has to perform.</i>

24:21.749 --> 24:23.215
<i>Yes, but if there's no war,</i>

24:23.375 --> 24:25.801
<i>you can't perform, so you
can't make a profit.</i>

24:25.908 --> 24:27.305
<i>Objection.
That's not a question.</i>

24:27.386 --> 24:29.351
<i>As a businessman, I'd think
you'd want the war to go on forever.</i>

24:29.449 --> 24:30.041
<i>No.</i>

24:30.140 --> 24:31.736
<i>Because if there's
no war, you're out of a job.</i>

24:31.805 --> 24:32.482
<i>No, wait...</i>

24:32.589 --> 24:33.701
<i>Doesn't seem like a
very good business model.</i>

24:33.785 --> 24:35.992
<i>Objection.
Where's the question?</i>

24:36.128 --> 24:38.629
<i>Do you want the war to
go on forever, Mr. Erickson?</i>

24:38.725 --> 24:41.568
<i>With all due respect, young
lady, you're being a little bit naive.</i>

24:41.670 --> 24:42.465
<i>With all due respect,</i>

24:42.552 --> 24:45.526
<i>this is my deposition and
you're required to answer.</i>

24:45.628 --> 24:48.266
<i>As a businessman, do you want
the war to go on forever?</i>

24:48.366 --> 24:51.089
<i>The war will go
on forever, Ms. Parsons.</i>

24:52.559 --> 24:54.956
<i>People want the war to
end, and I sympathize.</i>

24:55.271 --> 24:58.593
<i>Because for the men fighting,
war is literally hell.</i>

24:58.728 --> 25:02.523
<i>But what folks like you don't understand
is, the decision ain't up to us.</i>

25:02.625 --> 25:04.513
<i>As long as there's people out
there trying to kill us,</i>

25:04.665 --> 25:06.699
<i>we'll be out there killing them.</i>

25:06.826 --> 25:07.932
<i>So your business model is...</i>

25:08.012 --> 25:10.071
<i>My business model is flawless.</i>

25:10.174 --> 25:14.151
<i>There'll always be war.
My services will always be needed.</i>

25:21.059 --> 25:24.632
<i>I'd like it on the record that Mr.
Erickson was smiling when he said that.</i>

25:38.103 --> 25:40.711
<i>I hope you're not
expecting an apology.</i>

25:40.823 --> 25:42.893
<i>I'm the one who
should apologize.</i>

25:45.113 --> 25:47.068
<i>I'm sorry for what I did.</i>

25:47.809 --> 25:49.712
<i>We had an understanding.</i>

25:50.744 --> 25:52.401
<i>I crossed the line.</i>

25:55.289 --> 25:57.873
<i>I never should have
gone to that place.</i>

25:59.508 --> 26:03.506
<i>You potentially exposed
me. You compromised me.</i>

26:09.106 --> 26:11.864
<i>When I asked you about
who was upstairs</i>

26:11.974 --> 26:14.144
<i>it was because I was
worried about you.</i>

26:14.248 --> 26:15.954
<i>Don't be.</i>

26:16.855 --> 26:19.108
<i>Keeping someone locked
up like that is...</i>

26:20.728 --> 26:23.198
<i>I'm afraid your
judgment is slipping.</i>

26:24.582 --> 26:26.820
<i>We're talking about a child.</i>

26:28.033 --> 26:31.097
<i>You can either let
me help you, or...</i>

26:31.595 --> 26:33.303
<i>Or what?</i>

26:36.171 --> 26:40.863
<i>You don't get it.
I can't trust you now.</i>

26:41.567 --> 26:44.638
<i>I will never be
able to trust you.</i>

26:46.028 --> 26:47.661
<i>So that's it?</i>

26:48.646 --> 26:50.726
<i>We won't ever see
each other again?</i>

26:50.864 --> 26:53.511
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

27:20.914 --> 27:22.371
<i>Come in.</i>

27:29.447 --> 27:31.588
<i>I appreciate you
coming to see me.</i>

27:33.489 --> 27:37.136
<i>You said on the phone that you
could help me with a case?</i>

27:37.761 --> 27:40.166
<i>I believe my government
has already helped you.</i>

27:40.266 --> 27:42.137
<i>Yes, they were
very cooperative.</i>

27:42.334 --> 27:43.580
<i>I'm glad.</i>

27:43.839 --> 27:46.852
<i>The French are usually
accused of being difficult.</i>

27:48.284 --> 27:49.799
<i>Come sit.</i>

27:59.577 --> 28:01.944
<i>This has nothing to do
with my government.</i>

28:02.338 --> 28:03.928
<i>They don't know I'm here.</i>

28:04.191 --> 28:05.586
<i>Okay.</i>

28:06.457 --> 28:11.149
<i>I have information that if I give
you, you did not get from me, yes?</i>

28:11.540 --> 28:13.164
<i>I understand.</i>

28:13.301 --> 28:16.556
<i>I cannot be involved
for obvious reasons.</i>

28:16.639 --> 28:18.732
<i>I won't ask you to be.</i>

28:22.353 --> 28:26.660
<i>There is a CIA agent
who is unstable...</i>

28:27.224 --> 28:29.665
<i>who has lost his way...</i>

28:30.905 --> 28:34.990
<i>who is doing things
I cannot accept.</i>

28:36.476 --> 28:38.450
<i>He's involved in the case?</i>

28:39.436 --> 28:40.851
Yes.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.629
I must go.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.853
You're late, Ms. Parsons.
My client's been waiting.

29:10.924 --> 29:13.281
I'm sorry.
Just getting a few things in order.

29:13.518 --> 29:14.605
Well, you're not getting
any more time,

29:14.687 --> 29:16.329
so you better start
asking your questions.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.332
Actually, I won't
be asking the questions.

29:18.545 --> 29:19.921
Good morning.

29:20.034 --> 29:22.544
Ms. Hewes will be
leading the deposition today.

29:28.382 --> 29:30.864
Mr. Erickson, could
you read for the record the

29:30.961 --> 29:33.472
highlighted portion of
this document, please?

29:33.897 --> 29:35.629
Hang on, Howard.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.111
All right.

29:42.073 --> 29:46.506
"Howard T. Erickson.
Operation Dust Devil."

29:48.931 --> 29:52.477
This is an internal memo from
the Central Intelligence Agency.

29:55.046 --> 29:59.016
Was High Star involved in Operation
Dust Devil with the CIA?

30:01.334 --> 30:02.713
Yes.

30:02.956 --> 30:06.128
How many High Star employees
were involved in Operation Dust Devil?

30:06.241 --> 30:07.030
Objection.

30:07.133 --> 30:09.131
A reply from Mr. Erickson would
violate the nondisclosure

30:09.223 --> 30:10.913
agreements governing
his contracts.

30:11.484 --> 30:14.598
Was Christopher Sanchez
involved in Operation Dust Devil?

30:14.722 --> 30:16.533
The same objection stands.

30:16.622 --> 30:19.462
Did Thomas Lowry, Jay
Rayburn and Robert Franks lose

30:19.569 --> 30:23.085
their lives while on a mission
for Operation Dust Devil?

30:23.309 --> 30:26.658
Objection. You can do this all
day, we're not going to answer.

30:26.779 --> 30:30.663
I just want to make sure that your
client's non-answers are on the record.

30:34.411 --> 30:41.339
In the broadest sense, Mr. Erickson, what
was the objective of Operation Dust Devil?

30:42.669 --> 30:45.453
You can answer, but only
in the most general terms.

30:48.187 --> 30:51.005
We were hired to
provide security-- routine

30:51.108 --> 30:53.629
security-- for
intelligence officers.

30:53.730 --> 30:59.174
In fact, High Star is only
authorized to provide security, correct?

30:59.265 --> 31:00.362
That's right.

31:00.474 --> 31:01.535
You're not allowed
o conduct any

31:01.616 --> 31:04.269
offensive missions of
any kind, is that right?

31:04.389 --> 31:05.770
Yes, ma'am.

31:05.929 --> 31:09.126
So if your company was
involved, in say, the abduction

31:09.214 --> 31:15.317
and interrogation of Afghanis, I mean
that would be illegal, would it not?

31:15.416 --> 31:17.399
Yes, it most certainly would.

31:18.990 --> 31:22.428
Mr. Erickson, are you
familiar with an intelligence

31:22.500 --> 31:26.295
officer named Gerald Boorman?

31:27.251 --> 31:30.033
Objection. We've been over this.
He can't answer that.

31:30.167 --> 31:33.885
Did Mr. Boorman oversee
Operation Dust Devil for the CIA?

31:34.459 --> 31:35.912
Objection.

31:37.314 --> 31:40.344
Did Mr. Boorman supply
human targets for extraction by

31:40.482 --> 31:44.531
members of Mr. Sanchez's
High Star Dust Devil unit?

31:44.645 --> 31:46.101
Objection.

31:49.947 --> 31:53.024
Mr. Erickson, can you identify
the person in this photograph?

31:57.487 --> 31:59.268
No, I cannot.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.240
You don't know
who this child is?

32:02.996 --> 32:05.913
No.
Never seen him before.

32:06.274 --> 32:08.602
Well, that's surprising,
because on the day

32:08.707 --> 32:12.937
that your men were killed, Mr. Boorman
instructed your men to

32:13.028 --> 32:16.129
seize this boy as part
of Operation Dust Devil.

32:27.194 --> 32:30.396
You didn't know that, Mr. Erickson?

32:32.324 --> 32:35.647
I repeat, I've never seen
this person before in my life.

32:37.471 --> 32:40.838
Erickson was stunned when
you showed him that picture.

32:43.138 --> 32:45.658
There's no way he knew who
Chris' unit pulled out.

32:46.243 --> 32:48.234
Boorman used Erickson.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.530
Well, like you said,
Boorman turned against Erickson.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.846
So now hopefully, they'll
turn against each other.

33:03.230 --> 33:04.902
We pulled out a kid?!

33:06.370 --> 33:07.477
What are you talking about?

33:07.639 --> 33:09.924
You used my
men to abduct a boy?

33:13.983 --> 33:14.963
Answer me.

33:15.156 --> 33:18.293
That last mission-- was
the asset a child?

33:19.260 --> 33:20.478
Who told you that?

33:20.580 --> 33:22.877
Patty Hewes, in
the middle of a deposition.

33:23.223 --> 33:24.734
She had a picture.

33:28.460 --> 33:31.653
Yes, Howard,
the target was a boy.

33:31.768 --> 33:33.496
Why the fuck
didn't you tell me?

33:34.228 --> 33:36.407
You never asked
who the targets were.

33:37.852 --> 33:39.270
What the hell do
you care, anyway?

33:39.412 --> 33:41.126
You got your contracts.

33:42.522 --> 33:45.139
This kid had information.

33:46.364 --> 33:49.077
His age doesn't change that.

33:51.189 --> 33:52.932
Where's the kid now?

33:53.258 --> 33:56.275
He's secure.
The agency is handling it.

33:58.182 --> 34:01.671
If I didn't know about this,
how the hell did Patty Hewes find out?

34:02.291 --> 34:06.979
Well, Chris Sanchez is the only
other person who saw him besides me.

34:08.871 --> 34:12.572
He must have slipped it to
Parsons before he redeployed.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.358
Sanchez won't be
a problem much longer.

34:28.478 --> 34:30.717
Jesus, announce
yourself next time.

34:31.020 --> 34:32.458
You want a hole in
your fucking head?

34:32.570 --> 34:34.286
You said we could not
be seen together.

34:34.393 --> 34:36.065
I was being cautious.

34:36.853 --> 34:37.996
What's your decision?

34:38.089 --> 34:40.482
I will do the job as you wish,
but I require two men to

34:40.578 --> 34:43.117
assist me, and they
also must be paid.

34:43.991 --> 34:46.271
You know these men?
You can trust them?

34:46.371 --> 34:51.635
Of course. I am as concerned
with discretion as you.

34:53.518 --> 34:55.103
Okay, then.

35:01.381 --> 35:02.577
Sanchez.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.381
Sanchez...

35:06.464 --> 35:08.498
Lowry, look at me.
Look at me!

35:08.600 --> 35:09.890
Rayburn!

35:09.973 --> 35:11.655
Lowry! Lowry!

35:18.226 --> 35:20.301
What the fuck
happened to my men?!

35:23.575 --> 35:25.305
Who the fuck is this?

36:42.089 --> 36:43.105
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

36:43.216 --> 36:44.462
<i>Jesus.</i>

36:45.001 --> 36:46.578
<i>Alaikum as-salaam.</i>

36:47.371 --> 36:48.553
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

36:48.657 --> 36:52.488
<i>We didn't have to look for your
Sanchez. He came to look for us.</i>

36:53.484 --> 36:54.694
<i>What do you mean?</i>

36:54.797 --> 36:59.556
<i>Bilal was asked to join a group of men
planning to kill a High Star employee.</i>

37:00.196 --> 37:01.738
<i>Do you know
who the employee was?</i>

37:01.844 --> 37:02.850
<i>No.</i>

37:02.947 --> 37:05.313
<i>- Who tried to recruit you?
- Intermediary.</i>

37:05.518 --> 37:07.618
<i>I do not know who it is
that wants man dead.</i>

37:08.020 --> 37:10.655
<i>But they had no trouble finding
someone else to commit the act.</i>

37:11.363 --> 37:12.247
<i>Why's that?</i>

37:12.360 --> 37:14.618
<i>The money they
offer, much money.</i>

37:33.373 --> 37:35.342
<i>Didn't think
you was gonna come.</i>

37:36.364 --> 37:38.970
<i>I'm not really sure
why I'm here.</i>

37:40.124 --> 37:42.399
<i>Except that you
wanted to see me.</i>

37:43.293 --> 37:45.051
<i>That's how it works.</i>

37:45.196 --> 37:48.948
<i>You want to see me, and I come.</i>

37:57.536 --> 37:59.442
<i>Little different this time.</i>

38:00.228 --> 38:02.321
<i>Oh, yeah, sorry about that.</i>

38:03.091 --> 38:06.578
<i>But I had to assume when you asked
me here, you were going to kill me.</i>

38:08.696 --> 38:11.310
<i>You told Patty
Hewes about the boy.</i>

38:15.874 --> 38:17.786
<i>I'm sorry I betrayed you.</i>

38:23.830 --> 38:28.484
<i>But he was just a boy.
I can't accept that.</i>

38:33.467 --> 38:35.298
<i>You did me a favor.</i>

38:37.159 --> 38:38.763
<i>How's that?</i>

38:42.409 --> 38:46.572
<i>I've had to cover
this whole thing up.</i>

38:47.110 --> 38:52.285
<i>And, uh...
I can't do it anymore.</i>

38:54.220 --> 38:59.415
<i>It'll all come out anyway.
It's just a matter of time.</i>

39:00.845 --> 39:04.159
<i>What are you covering up?
Who is the boy?</i>

39:04.360 --> 39:07.785
<i>The boy has information.</i>

39:08.332 --> 39:10.023
<i>His mother...</i>

39:13.148 --> 39:15.792
<i>she was an asset of mine.</i>

39:16.129 --> 39:23.243
<i>And, uh, she put it all on the line...
for me.</i>

39:23.558 --> 39:25.874
<i>For this fucking country.</i>

39:27.809 --> 39:29.736
<i>And it killed her.</i>

39:33.784 --> 39:40.422
<i>Now, all his mother
knew is with the boy.</i>

39:44.765 --> 39:50.023
<i>I... I think I'm losing my mind.</i>

39:50.790 --> 39:55.986
<i>I just, I... I want it to end.</i>

39:57.757 --> 40:00.804
<i>I want... I want out.</i>

40:05.508 --> 40:06.966
It's okay.

40:22.161 --> 40:27.246
<i>Hey. You can still make
it right, you know.</i>

40:28.531 --> 40:30.455
<i>Let the boy go.</i>

40:40.968 --> 40:42.207
Okay.

41:58.587 --> 42:02.959
<i>It should be a yellow
lemon cake. With yellow frosting.</i>

42:03.085 --> 42:06.564
<i>- Why lemon?
- That was Mom's favorite.</i>

42:07.283 --> 42:08.933
<i>And decorate
it with some daisies.</i>

42:09.067 --> 42:11.451
<i>You know... made from the icing.</i>

42:13.658 --> 42:16.070
<i>Hmm. Oh, this'll only
take a minute, boys.</i>

42:16.184 --> 42:18.914
<i>Hey, grab some Italian cookies
if you want, for the way home.</i>

42:19.025 --> 42:20.571
<i>And a few cheese Danish.</i>

42:21.019 --> 42:22.199
<i>What's the good word?</i>

42:22.405 --> 42:24.341
<i>Everything's
under control, sir.</i>

42:24.448 --> 42:25.994
<i>Okay, what's
the time frame here?</i>

42:26.119 --> 42:28.367
<i>Next 24 to 36.</i>

42:28.470 --> 42:32.252
<i>This has to be precision.
No mistakes, no traces.</i>

42:32.864 --> 42:35.085
<i>Nothing the press can grab onto.</i>

42:36.698 --> 42:38.480
<i>Next time you
hear from me, it'll be done.</i>

42:39.276 --> 42:40.748
<i>Outstanding.</i>

42:42.831 --> 42:44.536
<i>I'm worried about your friend.</i>

42:44.690 --> 42:45.924
<i>What does your source say?</i>

42:46.012 --> 42:48.967
<i>That someone here
is offering significant money</i>

42:49.367 --> 42:51.767
<i>to have a High Star
contractor killed.</i>

42:51.899 --> 42:54.239
<i>- Is it Chris?
- Source didn't say.</i>

42:54.959 --> 42:56.881
<i>Well, if it is, that
means he's still alive.</i>

42:57.149 --> 42:58.808
<i>Well, for now.</i>

43:00.034 --> 43:03.265
<i>I want to go over there.
I'll alert the authorities</i> <i>myself.</i>

43:03.362 --> 43:05.322
<i>No.
No, it's a bad idea.</i>

43:05.411 --> 43:07.733
<i>It would just put you and
your friend in more danger.</i>

43:09.348 --> 43:10.566
<i>Okay.</i>

43:10.821 --> 43:12.650
<i>I've got some
connections at the embassy.</i>

43:12.852 --> 43:16.760
<i>Maybe I can get them involved.
But I will do whatever I can.</i>

43:18.024 --> 43:19.738
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

43:45.127 --> 43:47.635
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, there.</i>

43:47.886 --> 43:51.507
<i>It's Gerald Boorman.
Remember me?</i>

43:53.616 --> 43:55.691
<i>Well, of course,
Mr. Boorman.</i>

44:00.295 --> 44:03.366
<i>So Erickson's
finally going to kill me.</i>

44:03.932 --> 44:05.677
<i>I was wondering.</i>

44:05.794 --> 44:09.133
<i>You still interested in what I
know about Howard Erickson?</i>

44:09.525 --> 44:11.604
<i>That depends on what you know.</i>

44:19.625 --> 44:24.631
<i>I can serve him up to you,
Ms. Hewes. On a platter.</i>

44:25.832 --> 44:28.321
<i>Well, it sounds like you
and I should get together.</i>

44:39.651 --> 44:42.758
<i>Get the fuck off me!
Fuck you, get off me!</i>

44:43.015 --> 44:45.965
<i>Get off me! Get the fuck off me!</i>

44:57.776 --> 44:59.642
<i>I assume you've heard by now.</i>

44:59.768 --> 45:01.520
<i>You're playing
with a man's life.</i>

45:10.782 --> 45:12.270
<i>Do not fuck with me, Patty.</i>

45:12.373 --> 45:14.144
<i>I swear to God
you'll regret this.</i>

45:14.252 --> 45:15.966
<i>- Good-bye, Ellen.
- Patty!</i>
