<i>It's the ultimate cooking competition,</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:08.301

<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

01:12.772 --> 01:14.841
-What's happening, home cooks?

01:14.908 --> 01:15.842
Hi!

01:15.909 --> 01:17.877
Welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>
Are you excited?

01:17.944 --> 01:19.679
-Yes!
-Nervous?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.481
-A tiny bit.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.451
Laura, Dominic, Bobbie,

01:24.517 --> 01:28.054
in this round, you'll need to create
a standout dish in your signature style,

01:28.121 --> 01:29.622
using ingredient boxes

01:29.689 --> 01:31.991
that are being prepared
right now in the back pantry

01:32.058 --> 01:33.593
by our guest chef and judge,

01:33.660 --> 01:36.696
chef, baker, author, entrepreneur,

01:36.763 --> 01:40.066
owner of legendary Italian eateries
all over the world,

01:40.133 --> 01:41.901
Chef Nancy Silverton.

01:41.968 --> 01:45.638
-Oh my God!
-Oh my God!

01:45.705 --> 01:48.575
I'm cooking for Nancy Silverton?!

01:48.641 --> 01:50.777
The stakes just went way up.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.581
All right, Chef. Whenever you're ready,
please send out those ingredient boxes.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.658
You'll start by blind bidding
on these three ingredient boxes

02:05.725 --> 02:08.027
using your bank of $25,000.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.297
The cook that bids highest
gets a Spend Box,

02:11.364 --> 02:13.566
which consists of luxury ingredients

02:13.633 --> 02:16.236
that'll elevate your dish to new heights.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.271
The one with the lowest bid
gets the Save Box,

02:18.338 --> 02:20.640
which is made up
of simple household staples,

02:20.707 --> 02:23.810
ready to be transformed
into culinary gold.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.547
And the bidder in between will be awarded
the mysterious Surprise Box.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.183
It has some unusual items

02:30.250 --> 02:32.652
that'll put your creativity to the test.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.754
In the end, the winning home cook

02:34.821 --> 02:37.290
walks away with whatever cash
is left in their bank.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.493
The minimum bid
for these three ingredient boxes

02:40.560 --> 02:42.495
is $2,500.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.031
So please, lock in your bids now.

02:49.068 --> 02:52.505
I like to spend money,
but I'm trying to be conservative.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.174
I want that Spend Box.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.943
I don't really care too much

02:57.010 --> 02:58.711
about how much money I'm taking home.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.880
It's more about a win for me, for sure.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.117
I want the Save Box.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.886
I'm really used to cooking
with simple ingredients.

03:06.953 --> 03:10.757
I'm confident I can pull off a great dish
with the least amount of money.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.460
All right, Laura,
let's take a look at your bid.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.899
Fifteen thousand dollars!

03:21.034 --> 03:22.869
Go big or go home, I guess?

03:25.338 --> 03:28.208
I think that's absolutely nuts
to spend $15,000.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.411
That's more than half
of what you're starting with!

03:31.477 --> 03:32.378
But that's just me.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.281
Dominic, let's take a look at your bid.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.483
Wow, the polar opposite.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.321
Dominic, you've bid the minimum--

03:41.387 --> 03:42.655
-Yeah.
-…of $2,500.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.624
Bobbie, let's take a look at your bid.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.560
$4,250.

03:47.627 --> 03:51.598
Laura, you had the highest bid,
which means you get the Spend Box.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.803
Dominic, you have the lowest bid,
which means you get the Save Box,

03:56.869 --> 03:58.838
and Bobbie, you got the surprise.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.108
Home cooks, you have 60 minutes to create

04:02.175 --> 04:04.277
your best dish in any style you'd like.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.746
Keep an eye on the line while you cook

04:06.813 --> 04:09.616
because Chef Nancy
will be sending through more upgrades

04:09.682 --> 04:10.950
to help your dish.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.152
Are you ready to cook at all costs?

04:13.219 --> 04:14.520
Yes!

04:14.587 --> 04:17.757
Perfect. Because the time starts now!

04:20.793 --> 04:22.895
Let's go! It's heavy!

04:28.434 --> 04:29.569
Oh, my. Oh, my.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.973
Green beans, lamb chops,
whole pomegranates.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.142
I'm very familiar with this piece of lamb.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.012
But oh my God, what am I going to do

04:39.078 --> 04:41.948
with instant mashed potatoes
and onion soup mix?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.516
My strategy is backfiring.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.219
The Save Box was not what I expected.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.688
We have fingerling potatoes.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.457
I spent $15,000 on the Spend Box.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.660
So I've proven that I like to spend money.

04:53.726 --> 04:54.627
Arugula!

04:54.694 --> 04:57.397
I wanted the box
that had premium ingredients.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.465
I'm seeing a bunch of things
that I'm familiar with.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.434
Obviously, potatoes, green beans,
super happy.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.502
I then see the lamb.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.370
Rack of lamb?

05:04.437 --> 05:06.139
I've never cooked lamb before,

05:06.205 --> 05:09.676
and what am I cooking today? Lamb!

05:09.742 --> 05:13.012
I love it, but not super familiar
with making it.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.782
Almonds, pomegranate glaze.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.885
I don't know anything
about a pomegranate glaze.

05:18.951 --> 05:22.622
However, I know a thing or two
about a pomegranate martini.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.059
It's actually really good.

05:27.393 --> 05:31.264
Pomegranate juice, pickled beans, leeks.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.632
I have the Surprise Box.

05:32.699 --> 05:36.102
I have canned potatoes, mixed nuts,
and a green thing.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.037
The green thing looks weedy.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.606
It-- It looks familiar,
but I have no clue what it is.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.908
Ground lamb.

05:41.974 --> 05:45.178
I see ground lamb
and I'm thinking, "Oh, no."

05:45.244 --> 05:48.481
I don't normally eat lamb,
so what am I supposed to do with this?

05:48.548 --> 05:50.016
I have absolutely no idea what to do.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.218
The Surprise Box is definitely a surprise.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.686
Oh, gosh.

05:53.753 --> 05:57.590
Okay, home cooks, looks like you
all got variations of lamb and potatoes.

05:57.657 --> 06:01.227
Laura has a rack of lamb
and fingerling potatoes in the Spend Box,

06:01.294 --> 06:04.864
Bobbie's got ground lamb
and canned potatoes in the Surprise Box,

06:04.931 --> 06:09.102
And Dom has lamb chops
and boxed mashed potatoes in the Save Box.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.670
Let's get those ideas going.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.638
I've never cooked with instant potatoes.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.807
I have no idea
what I'm going to make with that.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.544
Feeling very nervous and overwhelmed
with those ingredients that I don't know.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.646
I've never cooked with onion soup either.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.648
I'm like, "Where to start?"

06:22.715 --> 06:25.618
I love lamb.
It's one of my favorite proteins.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.755
It's very easy for me
to cook this on the grill,

06:28.821 --> 06:31.791
But those instant potatoes? Not my thing.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.127
We're gonna test some things here.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.631
-Ay, ay, ay.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.566
We gotta zhuzh this up a bit.

06:40.633 --> 06:44.270
I'm a marketing manager,
but what I wish I was doing for a living

06:44.337 --> 06:48.441
is a full-time job as a cook,
a food personality.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.842
Food is my passion.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.345
I have my food blog
and I-- cooking videos,

06:52.412 --> 06:55.348
but I just need confidence
to do that full-time.

06:56.048 --> 06:59.585
I think to myself, "Okay,
I'm gonna use those instant potatoes

06:59.652 --> 07:01.120
to make potato cakes."

07:01.187 --> 07:03.856
It's very mushy and tasteless.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.160
So I will need some spices.
That's for sure.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.899
Ah! Chef Nancy, how you doing?

07:12.965 --> 07:15.635
-I'm doing great. Thank you.
-What're you working on here?

07:15.701 --> 07:18.337
-I'm tying up my bouquet garni.
-Nice!

07:18.404 --> 07:21.707
Thyme and the rosemary and the bay
are just perfect complements

07:21.774 --> 07:24.010
to the kind of gaminess of lamb.

07:24.076 --> 07:27.213
Mm-hmm. There's some fun ingredients
that you put in those boxes.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.583
One thing I noticed was in the Save Box
was instant mashed potatoes.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.786
Do you think a home cook could
truly elevate that into a great dish?

07:33.853 --> 07:38.224
I was thinking about that lamb chop
with maybe a potato purée on the bottom.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.294
Nice. I saw in the Surprise Box
some dandelion greens.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.097
Yeah, I love the bitter flavor
of a dandelion green.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.467
They might look at it
and say, "I don't know what this is."

07:47.533 --> 07:50.803
"I'm not going to use it."
But if they taste it, as they should,

07:50.870 --> 07:53.372
they will hopefully be inspired.

07:53.439 --> 07:57.076
The Spend Box out there, Chef,
has pretty much everything I'd ever want,

07:57.143 --> 07:59.679
including a delicious rack of lamb.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.981
You've got the sweetness
of pomegranate glaze.

08:02.048 --> 08:02.882
Oh, yeah.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.384
That person better do a pretty great job.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.653
Right, I'm gonna go check in on them.
See you in a bit.

08:12.825 --> 08:18.698
I am fairly intimidated by my Spend Box,
but I was a cheerleader all my life.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.633
Go, Laura! You're so fine.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.237
You're gonna cook it
and blow everybody's mind!

08:24.303 --> 08:27.240
And I am one
of the most competitive people

08:27.306 --> 08:28.508
you will ever meet.

08:28.574 --> 08:32.211
I am here to cook my best
and show my love for cooking.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.146
So let's make it happen.

08:34.213 --> 08:36.949
I'm cutting the lamb into individual chops

08:37.016 --> 08:38.451
and I'm gonna grill it,

08:38.518 --> 08:41.487
mostly because that's how
I've seen it done before.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.623
I'm gonna toast these almonds up.

08:43.689 --> 08:46.192
These are going to provide
good texture for my green beans.

08:46.259 --> 08:50.963
I'm making grilled lamb
with potatoes and green bean almondine.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.398
Yeah.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.069
I have no idea what this is.

08:57.136 --> 09:00.206
I still have no idea what to do
with the ingredients in the box,

09:00.273 --> 09:01.641
but I don't have any other option.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.775
It's a bit bitter.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.577
I love cooking. I also love art.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.280
So I see my plate as like a canvas.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.782
When someone sees my dishes,

09:09.849 --> 09:12.218
they're blown away
by the artistry on a plate.

09:12.285 --> 09:16.088
I'm going to start the dish by sautéing
the leeks with the green thing.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.724
For these canned potatoes and ground lamb,

09:18.791 --> 09:20.993
I wanted to go something
a little bit more simple,

09:21.060 --> 09:24.730
so I'm making lamb meatballs,
as well as mashed potatoes.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.433
I'm seasoning them simply
with some salt and pepper,

09:27.500 --> 09:29.769
but I need some herbs, maybe some garlic.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.203
Garlic would be great.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.805
It makes everything taste better.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.310
Home cooks, the line is moving.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.611
Red lights are flashing.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.180
We got some upgrades.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.382
Are you ready for your first live auction?

09:43.449 --> 09:44.350
Yes!

09:46.986 --> 09:52.024
Home cooks,
our first item is Dijon mustard.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.061
Tangy emulsifier, great for a marinade.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.762
-Do I have $800?
-800!

09:56.829 --> 09:58.464
$800 going to Dominic, going once.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.199
$800, going twice.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.169
-Sold! Dominic!
-Thank you! Thank you very much!

10:03.235 --> 10:07.974
Home cooks, the next item
up for bid is, ooh! Roasted garlic.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.477
-Prepared by Chef Nancy Silverton herself.
-Wow.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.680
I'll start the bid at $1,000
'cause it touched her hand.

10:14.747 --> 10:15.948
$1,000. Do I have $1,000?

10:16.015 --> 10:17.283
Yes, you do.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.719
Dominic. Do I have $1,500?

10:19.785 --> 10:20.886
-$1,500!

10:20.953 --> 10:22.521
Do I have $1,800?

10:22.588 --> 10:23.456
-Yes.
-$1,800.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.992
-Do I have $2,000?

10:26.058 --> 10:28.561
I wonder why Laura's not bidding.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.463
Oh, that's right. She has no more money.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.331
-Do I have 2,300?
-Yes.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.600
$2,300! Dominic really wants
this roasted garlic.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.535
-Do I have 2,500?

10:36.602 --> 10:39.105
2,500, Bobbie! Let's go!

10:39.171 --> 10:41.007
-Let's go! $3,000.

10:41.073 --> 10:41.907
-3,400!

10:41.974 --> 10:43.109
-3,700!

10:43.175 --> 10:44.410
-4,000.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.578
-$4,500!

10:45.645 --> 10:47.113
-$5,000!

10:47.179 --> 10:48.914
Whoo, baby!

10:48.981 --> 10:50.850
-$5,500.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.119
I need that bold flavor

10:53.185 --> 10:55.354
for my potato cake.
Just need it at all costs.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.390
Do I have $6,000?

10:58.457 --> 11:00.459
Do I have $6,500?

11:01.427 --> 11:03.229
-$6,500!

11:03.295 --> 11:04.864
-This is so insane!
-Dominic, stop it!

11:04.930 --> 11:08.734
$6,500, going once, going twice! Sold!

11:08.801 --> 11:10.536
The most expensive garlic ever made!

11:11.237 --> 11:13.939
That's a lot of money
to spend on food.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.075
Thank you. It's beautiful.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.044
But I was not going
to let her get my garlic.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.212
Trying to be frugal over here.

11:20.946 --> 11:24.550
Next item up for bid is bouquet garni.

11:24.617 --> 11:28.988
Here, you have a bundle
of rosemary, of thyme, and bay leaves.

11:29.055 --> 11:32.058
This right here is great for aromatics,
great for a marinade, great flavoring.

11:32.124 --> 11:33.926
I'll start the bid at $1,000.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.695
-I need these fresh herbs.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.163
They add so much flavor.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.998
This is where I'm going to spend my money.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.100
-Do I have $1,200 for this?

11:41.167 --> 11:42.334
$1,200 for Dominic!

11:42.401 --> 11:43.803
Dominic and Bobbie, I like this.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.305
Dom, you have your garlic.
Let me have my fresh herbs.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.573
-$1,400.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.341
-Do I have 1,500?

11:49.408 --> 11:51.544
-Do I have $1,800?

11:51.610 --> 11:53.612
Oh, yes, I do! $1,800 going once.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.082
$1,800 going twice.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.349
Sold!

11:57.416 --> 12:00.119
To Bobbie. Come pick up your…
…bouquet garni.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.389
Bobbie, Dominic, I like this.
I like this battle.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.359
Home cooks, this next item
up for auction is a blind bid.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.895
So you don't know what it is,
but here's what I'll tell you.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.531
It is the perfect complement for lamb.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.500
Blind bid $500, where I'll start.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.368
-500.
-$500 going, Dominic.

12:16.435 --> 12:17.737
-$600 to Bobbie.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.405
-Do I have 800? 800?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.040
-Do I have 900?

12:21.107 --> 12:24.710
I'm bidding to drive up the price
and annoy Dom a little bit.

12:24.777 --> 12:28.013
1,500, Dominic. Do I have 1,800?

12:28.614 --> 12:29.715
Do I have 2,000?

12:29.782 --> 12:32.618
-$2,000 going once, $2,000 going twice.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.921
Sold! Mint jelly!

12:35.988 --> 12:38.023
-Thank you.
-This was a battle!

12:40.159 --> 12:43.095
All of you are cooking at all costs.

12:52.204 --> 12:55.508
You can never go wrong
with anything grilled. Right?

12:55.574 --> 12:57.343
-Laura, I can tell you're having fun.
-Yeah.

12:57.409 --> 13:00.112
I want to have some of that fun with you.
Is there a cheer we can do?

13:00.179 --> 13:01.814
-Yeah, let's do one. Okay.
-Okay, go.

13:03.749 --> 13:06.418
-G-O! Let's go, let's go!
-…go!

13:06.485 --> 13:07.987
-G-O! Let's go.
-G… Go!

13:08.053 --> 13:09.889
Come on, Bobbie! G-O!

13:09.955 --> 13:11.490
Let's go, let's go!

13:11.557 --> 13:12.892
-G-O! Let's go!

13:12.958 --> 13:14.126
Dominic!

13:14.193 --> 13:16.362
G-O! Let's go, let's go!

13:16.428 --> 13:18.631
G-O! Let's go!

13:18.697 --> 13:21.734
-Let's go! That was awesome!

13:24.436 --> 13:27.740
Now that I have these herbs,
I'm putting them in the ground lamb

13:27.807 --> 13:30.042
and some of it into the mashed potatoes.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.244
I would love it
if I had some bread crumbs.

13:32.311 --> 13:36.448
I could really use some bread crumbs
as a binder for my lamb meatballs.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.351
So I am encrusting
my meatballs with mixed nuts.

13:40.419 --> 13:41.821
How are we doing, Bobbie?

13:41.887 --> 13:43.222
-Doing good. Doing good.
-Yeah?

13:43.289 --> 13:44.924
Concentrating quite a bit.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.662
Okay, I need to get my lamb going,

13:49.728 --> 13:52.598
I bought the Dijon
specifically for the lamb.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.368
And I'm using
this expensive roasted garlic

13:56.435 --> 13:59.338
to flavor
my instant mashed potato patties.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.241
It has a very bold
and sweet garlic flavor.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.244
I'm going to fry up my potato cakes.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.881
And then,
mint jelly goes well with lamb,

14:08.948 --> 14:10.082
so it kind of inspired me

14:10.149 --> 14:13.252
to make a simple pesto with the spinach,
to pair perfectly with the lamb.

14:13.319 --> 14:16.388
It's gonna be worth it.
It needed the sweetness.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.424
Four minutes, 30 seconds left!

14:18.991 --> 14:21.460
For my meatballs,
I'm making pomegranate reduction

14:21.527 --> 14:24.530
as kind of like a side sauce,
so it'll be drizzled around the plate

14:24.597 --> 14:25.965
and it'll add a really nice color.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.169
Oh, crap! Burnt my pomegranate reduction.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.405
I have to start all over again.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.908
I don't have much time left.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.309
Oh, gosh!

14:37.376 --> 14:39.178
My plate is like my canvas.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.279
I need color.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.947
Ninety seconds left.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.483
Shut up! Seriously?

14:46.652 --> 14:50.055
Don't forget, you need
to get your plate onto the line

14:50.122 --> 14:53.259
and hit the red button
before time runs out.

14:53.325 --> 14:57.630
My pomegranate reduction is very thin.
I am not happy with it.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.265
It looks so bad.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.772
Okay, here she is.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.912
Five, four, three…

15:12.978 --> 15:14.346
-…two, one.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.016
Whoo! Good job.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.087
Okay, home cooks.
Let's send your plates back to Chef Nancy.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.255
It's time for her to judge.

15:23.822 --> 15:25.891
I really want to impress Nancy.

15:25.958 --> 15:29.461
She is one of my culinary inspirations.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.230
I admire her so much.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.033
Wow, that was intense!

15:35.267 --> 15:37.036
-Chef! Are you hungry?
-I am.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.306
Okay, this dish is
a nut-crusted lamb meatball

15:40.372 --> 15:42.708
with potatoes, pomegranate glaze,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.643
and a dandelion and leek sauté.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.348
I love pomegranate glaze.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.717
It's sweet but it's also, uh, acidic.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.453
I would have just put it
on the bottom of the plate,

15:54.520 --> 15:56.322
only because the darkness

15:56.388 --> 15:58.857
kind of stains the potatoes,
and I like food to look bright.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.294
I'm so happy that the cook

16:02.361 --> 16:04.596
did not shy away
from using the dandelion greens,

16:04.663 --> 16:07.566
and they're sautéed beautifully.
They're nice and green still.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.401
I love that they mixed them with leeks.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.538
This home cook
picked up your bouquet garni--

16:12.604 --> 16:14.206
-Yeah.
-…for $1,800.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.742
-Money well spent, I may add.
-Um, oh! Okay, yeah.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.277
Did they utilize those ingredients?

16:18.344 --> 16:20.946
It's there.
I think it's really well balanced.

16:21.013 --> 16:23.782
The meatballs, you get
that subtle gaminess,

16:23.849 --> 16:25.217
lambiness of the lamb,

16:25.284 --> 16:27.219
but it's well balanced
with that pomegranate.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.822
-So, it's a good surprise?
-Yeah, a good surprise.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.659
-Right, Chef, you ready for the next one?
-I'm ready.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.028
This dish is grilled lamb chops

16:36.095 --> 16:38.030
with a potato cake, some aioli,

16:38.097 --> 16:39.531
and a spinach pesto.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.600
That's a potato cake
from instant mashed potatoes.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.969
-I know. I can't wait to try that.

16:49.274 --> 16:50.509
A touch gluey,

16:50.576 --> 16:53.679
but it still fits the bill
of a potato cake.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.284
There's a sweetness in this.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.253
Is this the person
that bought the mint jelly?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.889
-Yes.
-I've never had a better usage of it.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.725
Lamb is cooked really nicely.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.727
Look it. I mean, it's still pink.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.430
You can see a good char mark on there,
yet it's still cooked well.

17:11.497 --> 17:16.402
This home cook purchased
roasted garlic for $6,500!

17:16.468 --> 17:18.871
And then also got, obviously,
the mint jelly, as you tasted,

17:18.937 --> 17:20.839
and the Dijon mustard.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.609
I don't know if I would
have spent <i>that </i>much money,

17:23.675 --> 17:26.578
but those upgrades definitely helped it.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.982
Chef, this dish is

17:30.049 --> 17:32.284
almond-crusted grilled lamb chop

17:32.351 --> 17:33.585
with twice-cooked potatoes

17:33.652 --> 17:35.354
and green bean almondine.

17:35.421 --> 17:40.859
This is the Spend Box
and this home cook spent $15,000

17:40.926 --> 17:42.161
on this box.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.228
Okay.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.799
Another nicely cooked piece of lamb.

17:46.865 --> 17:47.833
Right? Pink.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.834
Mm-hmm.

17:50.502 --> 17:53.005
I'm not tasting that pomegranate glaze.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.240
And the beans are
a little bit underseasoned.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.510
The cook definitely had
the best intentions,

17:58.577 --> 18:00.179
and the dish is good.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.482
It's just that I wouldn't
have minded tasting something

18:03.549 --> 18:06.452
that has a little bit more of a pop to it.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.755
One last question, Chef Nancy.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.323
Have you come to a decision?

18:11.390 --> 18:12.958
You know, I think I have a winner.

18:17.196 --> 18:21.433
It's time to announce a winner.
The home cook with the best dish is…

18:24.269 --> 18:25.537
-Bobbie.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.406
-Whoo!

18:27.473 --> 18:29.408
I can't believe I just won!

18:29.475 --> 18:30.876
I was not expecting that.

18:31.643 --> 18:35.013
I'm very, very surprised
that I won with the Surprise Box.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.682
I'm just blown away.

18:37.249 --> 18:41.487
Your final challenge is inspired
by the one and only Chef Nancy Silverton.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.456
Since Chef Nancy is an expert
in all things Italian,

18:44.523 --> 18:46.358
we're going to throw a piazza party.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.594
-Yay! Mwah!

18:49.194 --> 18:51.997
Right now, Chef Nancy is creating
the ingredient boxes

18:52.064 --> 18:55.033
that'll help you create
your best Italian dish.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.336
All right, Chef Nancy! <i>Andiamo</i>!

19:00.405 --> 19:03.208
In this round,
the boxes have set prices.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.380
The Spend Box is going to run you $8,000.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.416
-The Save Box will cost you $4,000.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.520
And the Surprise Box will cost you $6,000.

19:14.586 --> 19:18.724
Bobbie, since you won the first round,
you get first choice of boxes.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.192
Oh, okay.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.829
And you get to assign the other two
to whichever home cooks you'd like.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.365
-Oh!
-Oh, no!

19:26.431 --> 19:27.866
Price tag included.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.569
Bobbie, which box do you want to buy?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.605
I will do the Save Box.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.773
I'm picking the Save Box

19:34.840 --> 19:37.476
because I don't want
to take away from my bank,

19:37.543 --> 19:39.912
so I can spend big at the auction.

19:39.978 --> 19:43.248
Who would you like to assign
the $8,000 Spend Box to?

19:43.315 --> 19:45.717
We'll do the Spend Box…

19:48.754 --> 19:50.422
-…for Dominic.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.492
I want to assign
Dominic the more expensive box

19:53.559 --> 19:56.929
just because Laura spent
way too much money in round one.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.464
So I wanted to help her out
and give her the Surprise Box.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.100
The cook with the best piazza party dish

20:02.167 --> 20:04.937
will win the round
and whatever is left in your bank.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.706
You have 45 minutes on the clock.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.474
Let's cook at all costs! Go!

20:09.541 --> 20:10.709
Whoo!

20:13.478 --> 20:15.948
Surprise me, Surprise Box.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.185
In the Save Box,

20:20.252 --> 20:22.588
I see canned whole tomatoes,

20:22.654 --> 20:23.956
pepperoni slices.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.193
Some polenta and zucchini.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.263
These aren't great ingredients.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.366
But I'm the richest person here right now,

20:34.933 --> 20:38.003
so I can spend as much money
as it takes at the auction.

20:38.704 --> 20:39.905
Dom, what'd you get?

20:39.972 --> 20:43.275
Oh my God, fennel, my favorite!

20:43.342 --> 20:47.946
Prosciutto, focaccia, eggplant.

20:48.013 --> 20:51.183
There's very good quality ingredients
in the Spend Box.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.387
Very good prosciutto.
Very good burrata, fresh produce.

20:55.454 --> 20:58.490
I think Bobbie just made
a big mistake giving me the Spend Box.

20:58.557 --> 20:59.891
It's very good.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.894
Let's do it!

21:03.428 --> 21:05.430
In my Surprise Box,

21:05.497 --> 21:08.834
I have pancetta, anchovies.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.435
Anchovy?

21:10.502 --> 21:12.738
Um, FYI, I've never had it.

21:13.305 --> 21:14.873
Italian dressing,

21:14.940 --> 21:18.944
ricotta, and strained tomatoes.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.447
Surprise! I don't even know
where to go with that.

21:22.514 --> 21:23.849
Okey-dokey.

21:23.915 --> 21:27.619
Wow. Looks like you all have
cured meat and tomatoes.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.555
Pancetta and strained tomatoes
in the Surprise Box.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.991
Pepperoni and canned tomatoes
in the Save Box.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.061
And prosciutto and fresh tomatoes
in the Spend Box.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.262
Love it.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.665
Dominic,
what you got going on over there?

21:39.731 --> 21:43.135
-I got some tomatoes sautéing--
-Okay.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.170
…with fennel, onions, and basil.

21:45.237 --> 21:48.707
-Cool.
-And some eggplant.

21:48.774 --> 21:52.978
I have eggplant, so I am going
to make eggplant Parmigiana

21:53.045 --> 21:55.814
with fennel cream of tomato sauce,
and crispy prosciutto.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.384
Making eggplant Parmesan
for Nancy Silverton,

21:59.451 --> 22:02.721
it's, "Oh my God! I need to get it right."

22:02.788 --> 22:05.490
Just make the most creative dish
that I can possibly do.

22:06.124 --> 22:07.826
Bobbie, what do you have going on?

22:07.893 --> 22:09.861
I've got a lot going on right now.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.797
I have cooked with polenta before,

22:11.863 --> 22:14.700
but I'm not 100% comfortable with it.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.735
I'm just going to hope for the best.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.138
I'm making polenta with tomato sauce,

22:20.205 --> 22:23.709
using the zucchini
and I guess the pepperoni,

22:23.775 --> 22:25.544
but I would prefer if I had

22:25.610 --> 22:27.813
another type of protein to add to my dish.

22:28.980 --> 22:32.050
-Something smells delicious.

22:32.117 --> 22:36.655
That means my basil is fresh.
So I'm making a basil pesto.

22:36.722 --> 22:39.758
What's your secret to an amazing pesto?

22:39.825 --> 22:41.993
Fresh basil, Parmigiano Reggiano.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.261
-And pine nuts--
-Pine nuts?

22:43.328 --> 22:45.664
…that are not rancid
and are properly toasted.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.834
And I-- Rancid? I don't understand.
It's like, "Those can go bad?"

22:48.900 --> 22:51.103
-Yeah. There's a lot of oil in pine nuts.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.537
Uh, so they can go bad.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.473
-So taste 'em before you use them.
-Mm-hmm.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.876
Now, I noticed in the ingredient boxes,
you only included cured meats.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.312
What are you expecting
from each of the individual boxes?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.748
With cured meats,
the flavor is so concentrated.

23:02.814 --> 23:03.648
Mm-hmm.

23:03.715 --> 23:07.085
The prosciutto,
that's really an easy one to work with.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.788
But when it comes to the pepperoni,
like, what are you going to do

23:09.855 --> 23:10.922
if it's not on a pizza?

23:10.989 --> 23:15.527
-Mm-hmm.
-But pepperoni is really a flavor carrier.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.095
A little goes a long way with it.

23:17.162 --> 23:20.332
So it's almost like a seasoning,
they should use it as.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.633
That's a good way to look at it.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.136
Are you gonna be sending out
any other proteins?

23:24.202 --> 23:27.873
-You're gonna just have to wait and see.
-All right, I'm gonna go check up on them.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.107
-See you soon.
-See you.

23:35.447 --> 23:36.648
Fire!

23:36.715 --> 23:38.016
Whoo!

23:38.083 --> 23:40.419
So I have ricotta cheese,

23:40.485 --> 23:42.888
pancetta, and this tomato sauce,

23:42.954 --> 23:44.055
and I instantly think,

23:44.122 --> 23:46.124
"Aha! We've got a gnocchi!"

23:46.958 --> 23:50.529
So I'm making a ricotta gnocchi.

23:50.595 --> 23:54.966
A bad gnocchi is something that is
just, like, chewy and almost overdone.

23:55.033 --> 23:58.370
You want it to be
just like a pillow in your mouth.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.305
Some people think it's crazy

24:00.372 --> 24:02.908
to make a homemade pasta
with this amount of time,

24:02.974 --> 24:07.212
but I am a very busy mom
of two young kids.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.482
So, I'm trying for 30-minute meals
as much as I can.

24:10.549 --> 24:14.119
Typically, I do have
Parmesan cheese in this.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.154
Of course, I have no Parmesan,

24:16.221 --> 24:18.390
so I have to fly by the seat of my pants.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.025
Yikes. Oh, yikes.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.065
Whoa!

24:27.132 --> 24:30.068
I see these cloches
coming down the line,

24:30.135 --> 24:32.037
and I'm just praying,

24:32.103 --> 24:34.372
"Please, let there be Parmesan."

24:36.441 --> 24:38.677
First item up for bid is…

24:38.743 --> 24:40.846
frutti di mare!

24:40.912 --> 24:43.181
Mussels, clams, calamari.

24:43.248 --> 24:45.083
-Popular along coastlines in Italy--

24:45.150 --> 24:47.552
…and a staple
in many Italian dishes.

24:47.619 --> 24:51.656
I'm so happy to see seafood.
This is exactly what I need right now.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.825
Now, I'm gonna start
the bidding here for $800.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.160
-$800.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.161
$800 to Bobbie.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.196
-$1,000.
-$1,000 to Dominic.

24:58.263 --> 25:00.632
I'm seeing this seafood,
but honestly,

25:00.699 --> 25:03.401
I'm just bidding
to give a hard time to Bobbie.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.204
-$1,200.
-$1,200 to Bobbie.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.341
$1,200 going once, going twice.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.244
Sold! To Bobbie for $1,200.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.082
The next item up for auction is…

25:17.148 --> 25:19.551
homemade mortar-and-pestle pesto

25:19.618 --> 25:21.419
made by Nancy Silverton herself.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.655
-Oh my God!
-Oh, wow!

25:23.722 --> 25:25.657
Like, okay, I gotta have this.

25:25.724 --> 25:29.528
Let me give you guys a deal.
$500 is where we'll start this bidding.

25:29.594 --> 25:31.363
-500.
-$500 for Dominic.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.331
-$600 to Laura.

25:33.398 --> 25:34.366
There's the big spender!

25:34.432 --> 25:35.467
Whoo!

25:35.534 --> 25:37.335
-$800 to Dominic.
-800.

25:37.402 --> 25:38.870
Do I have $1,000?

25:38.937 --> 25:41.640
$800 going once, going twice…

25:41.706 --> 25:42.874
-Sold!

25:42.941 --> 25:45.477
Dominic. $800 pesto.

25:47.012 --> 25:50.048
All right, so there are four items
in this menu.

25:50.649 --> 25:52.484
I'm not going to tell you what they are.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.620
But here's what I'll tell you,
this is definitely a fine dining menu.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.856
You can select one of the four if you win.

25:57.923 --> 26:00.625
I'm gonna start the bidding at $1,000.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.727
-I'll start at a thousand.
-$1,000.

26:02.794 --> 26:03.862
$1,500?

26:03.929 --> 26:05.897
$1,000 going once,

26:05.964 --> 26:08.600
$1,000 going twice.

26:09.734 --> 26:10.869
Ooh.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.704
She's a last-minute type of girl.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.539
Do I have $2,000?

26:14.606 --> 26:17.142
$1,500 going once, $1,500 going twice.

26:17.943 --> 26:21.379
Sold to Bobbie! Come check this out.

26:21.446 --> 26:24.749
Any selection of one thing in there.
What are the four options you have there?

26:24.816 --> 26:29.154
I have truffles, Parmesan cheese,
dry pasta, and sausage.

26:30.055 --> 26:33.892
Bobbie scooping up <i>my</i> Parmesan!

26:33.959 --> 26:35.927
-So what do you want to have?
-Dry pasta, please.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.062
The dry pasta.

26:37.128 --> 26:38.697
The server will be right with you.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.336
I want this pasta
so I don't have to do the polenta,

26:44.402 --> 26:47.238
and I know that'll work really well
with the seafood.

26:47.305 --> 26:50.742
This'll definitely elevate
my dish to a whole nother level.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.944
Now that I have
these beautiful ingredients,

26:53.011 --> 26:55.580
I'm going to focus more
on my auction ingredients

26:55.647 --> 26:56.748
than my Save Box.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.818
I'm not using the pepperoni.

26:59.884 --> 27:03.355
So I'm making tagliatelle frutti di mare.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.090
Just throw this all in there.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.259
Fifteen minutes left on the clock.

27:08.326 --> 27:10.729
Whoo! Let's get it going!

27:10.795 --> 27:14.099
I gotta get something
with that tomato sauce started.

27:14.165 --> 27:17.435
However, I don't have my seasonings.

27:17.502 --> 27:20.772
I'm trying to make
a tomato sauce for my gnocchi

27:20.839 --> 27:23.208
without a cent of seasoning.

27:23.274 --> 27:24.809
But I have wine,

27:24.876 --> 27:28.780
and I have
this Italian dressing.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.849
So I just put it all in the pot

27:30.915 --> 27:32.817
and prayed to God that it would work.

27:33.318 --> 27:37.422
What's really important is to get
that eggplant really crispy.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.592
And the focaccia is a great breading,

27:40.659 --> 27:45.330
but I really need olive oil
just to nail the crispiness.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.402
Something's coming, guys.

27:50.468 --> 27:51.836
What do we have?

27:51.903 --> 27:55.073
Home cooks,
it's a bonus upgrade auction.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.641
Get ready with those buzzers.

27:58.943 --> 28:01.579
Aged balsamic and extra virgin olive oil.

28:01.646 --> 28:02.647
Ooh.

28:03.214 --> 28:04.582
Start the bidding at $500.

28:04.649 --> 28:05.750
-$500.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.819
$500 to Dominic. Do I have $600?

28:08.620 --> 28:11.856
$500 going once, $500 going twice.

28:11.923 --> 28:14.092
Sold to Dominic for $500!

28:15.326 --> 28:18.430
So Dominic, your options are for $500,

28:18.496 --> 28:20.799
you can either have
the olive oil and aged balsamic,

28:20.865 --> 28:22.600
or whatever is underneath this cloche.

28:23.968 --> 28:26.705
I'm curious to see
what's under the other cloche,

28:26.771 --> 28:29.441
but I really need extra virgin olive oil.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.676
I'm getting the olive oil
and the balsamic.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.445
-Is that your final decision?
-Yes.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.947
Then let's take a look
at what you could have had.

28:36.915 --> 28:40.118
Five thousand dollars back into your bank.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.453
Oh, my God.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.921
Come get your olive oil.

28:42.987 --> 28:44.456
That's pretty messed up.

28:44.522 --> 28:47.192
Really hurts.
The cash would have been nice.

28:47.926 --> 28:48.760
Oh, well!

28:48.827 --> 28:51.763
But the olive oil is going
to make the difference in my dish.

28:51.830 --> 28:54.132
Now I can get the eggplant crispy.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.735
Five minutes left on the clock.

28:58.470 --> 29:02.807
My pasta is a little too al dente
and my seafood is still cooking,

29:02.874 --> 29:05.977
but I have no time left,
so this'll just have to do.

29:06.578 --> 29:10.381
I'm adding it to my sauce
so it can cook in there a little bit more,

29:10.448 --> 29:12.383
and absorb some more of that flavor.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.886
I really wanted
to honor Nancy's pesto,

29:14.953 --> 29:17.388
so I'm using the pesto as a sauce

29:17.455 --> 29:20.825
for a very fresh and bold fennel slaw.

29:20.892 --> 29:23.027
Okay, guys! We got two minutes!

29:23.094 --> 29:25.563
-Let's do it!
-Whoo! Let's go!

29:26.064 --> 29:30.068
<i>Bellissimo</i>! I don't know what that means,
but I think it means something good.

29:31.035 --> 29:34.005
Is this the winning dish?
I don't know. But you know what?

29:34.072 --> 29:37.709
You can put lipstick on a pig
and she looks pretty doggone good.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.944
Thirty seconds left.

29:40.011 --> 29:43.381
Remember, you got to get your plates
to the line and hit the red buzzer

29:43.448 --> 29:44.749
before time runs out.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.485
I am not happy with my plating.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.621
This is not my best piece of art,

29:50.188 --> 29:52.991
but with the limited amount
of time I have…

29:55.760 --> 29:57.796
Ten seconds, nine,

29:57.862 --> 30:00.932
eight, seven, six,

30:00.999 --> 30:02.467
-five…

30:02.534 --> 30:04.035
-…four…

30:04.102 --> 30:07.071
-…three, two, one.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.107
Whoo, baby!

30:09.174 --> 30:10.308
Oh, God!

30:11.576 --> 30:14.979
Your dishes are off
to final judgment by Chef Nancy.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.454
-That was intense.

30:23.521 --> 30:25.123
-You ready?
-Oh, yes.

30:25.190 --> 30:28.326
So this dish is
a tagliatelle frutti di mare.

30:28.393 --> 30:32.096
So it has the calamari,
mussel, and clam upgrade.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.399
This came from the Save Box.

30:34.465 --> 30:38.436
Well, it came from the Save Box,
but not so much of a Save Box anymore.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.572
-Given the seafood upgrades, right?
-Yes.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.609
And obviously switched out
the polenta for the pasta.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.543
Yes. Correct.

30:49.214 --> 30:51.282
You know, pasta is nicely cooked.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.951
I can tell the mussels are plump

30:53.017 --> 30:55.453
but there's nothing
that stands out about it.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.288
I don't taste the pepperoni at all.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.591
-That would have given it that kick.
-Mm-hmm.

30:59.657 --> 31:02.193
And I think it would
have transformed the pasta

31:02.260 --> 31:04.629
from something
that's a little bit ordinary

31:04.696 --> 31:07.031
to something that was maybe extraordinary.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.536
All right, Chef. So in front of you,
you have an eggplant Parmesan

31:11.603 --> 31:14.305
with a creamy fennel tomato sauce,

31:14.372 --> 31:16.641
a fennel pesto slaw,

31:16.708 --> 31:17.876
and crispy prosciutto.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.214
The crispiness of the eggplant
is terrific.

31:23.281 --> 31:26.751
I love the crispy prosciutto.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.253
Nice texture with all that,

31:28.319 --> 31:31.222
which I love against the creaminess
of the tomato sauce.

31:31.289 --> 31:34.392
And then the fennel with the basil pesto.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.629
Did they do your pesto sauce justice?

31:37.695 --> 31:41.933
I think I'd rather be able
to recognize it better.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.569
For me,
the most successful part of the dish

31:44.636 --> 31:48.873
is really that fry on the eggplant.

31:50.775 --> 31:53.144
-All right, Chef, ready for the next dish?
-I'm ready.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.214
For this dish, you have a ricotta gnocchi

31:56.281 --> 31:58.750
in a tomato sauce with crispy pancetta.

31:59.517 --> 32:02.120
That gnocchi was homemade.
Forty-five minutes.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.224
You know, I love ricotta gnocchi.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.293
I have to say this one's a little dry.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.996
But it's a smart move.
Look it, you've got ricotta.

32:12.063 --> 32:13.698
You want to turn it into an Italian dish

32:13.765 --> 32:16.334
and this certainly goes
under the pasta category.

32:16.401 --> 32:20.438
Think the most successful part
really is the flavor of that tomato sauce.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.373
This was not an easy box.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.076
So, I say not only an A for effort,

32:25.143 --> 32:26.077
an A for--

32:26.144 --> 32:27.045
Ingenuity?

32:27.111 --> 32:28.513
Ab-- Without a doubt.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.450
You've now tasted
all three of the home cooks' dishes.

32:32.517 --> 32:36.321
-Do you think you can select a winner?
-It's a tough one, but I think I can.

32:43.094 --> 32:45.296
It's time to find out
who won the competition

32:45.363 --> 32:47.265
and all the cash in their banks.

32:47.332 --> 32:51.703
But first, allow me to introduce you
to our guest chef and judge,

32:51.769 --> 32:55.006
the incomparable Chef Nancy Silverton.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.345
-Hello, home cooks.
-Hello, hi!

33:00.411 --> 33:01.813
Let's get to the results.

33:04.082 --> 33:08.019
So, who made the tagliatelle
with the frutti di mare?

33:08.820 --> 33:09.654
That was me.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.489
So Bobbie, I gotta compliment you.

33:11.556 --> 33:15.793
Your pasta was well cooked,
and the seafood was cooked perfectly.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.562
-Good job.
-Thank you.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.999
Which of you made the eggplant Parmigiana?

33:21.065 --> 33:22.100
I did.

33:22.166 --> 33:26.804
Dominic, your eggplant
was delicious and perfectly crispy.

33:26.871 --> 33:30.041
It was really a complex and creative dish.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.642
-Well done!
-Thank you.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.945
-Laura.
-Hi.

33:34.012 --> 33:37.548
I was really impressed
that you made gnocchi in 45 minutes.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.817
You used the ricotta. Impressive.

33:41.352 --> 33:45.256
Now, it's time to find out
whose home cooking was money in the bank.

33:45.823 --> 33:48.826
Laura, you have $4,000 left in your bank.

33:48.893 --> 33:51.829
Dominic, you have $3,900,

33:51.896 --> 33:56.034
and Bobbie, you have
the largest amount with $12,250.

33:56.968 --> 34:00.104
So the home cook with the best dish is…

34:05.276 --> 34:06.110
Dominic.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.079
-My God.
-Whoo!

34:11.716 --> 34:13.785
Oh, my God. Thank you so much, guys.

34:13.851 --> 34:17.922
Dominic, you've won
the $3,900 left in your bank.

34:17.989 --> 34:18.990
-Yay!

34:20.925 --> 34:24.062
I feel great. I'm so, so, so happy I won.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.064
But I also learned a lot about myself.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.600
The fact that I can cook
those ingredients that I don't know about,

34:29.667 --> 34:31.569
just totally wing it.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.404
Dominic, congratulations.

34:33.471 --> 34:35.573
You proved that you can cook at all costs.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.641
Thank you so much.

34:36.707 --> 34:38.042
-Yeah!

34:38.109 --> 34:42.180
I am just feeling
so grateful for the experience,

34:42.246 --> 34:44.916
which will be a forever memory for me.

34:45.483 --> 34:47.652
Being here,
it just kind of shows you

34:47.718 --> 34:51.355
that sometimes you are more capable
than you give yourself credit for.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.959
I really want
to pursue this culinary career

34:55.026 --> 34:58.196
and now I feel like I have
the confidence to do this full-time.
