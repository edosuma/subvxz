00:06.423 --> 00:08.633
[Es]<i> Over the last two decades of working,</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:13.012
<i>one of the things I've discovered</i>
<i>is often things are made to fill voids.</i>

00:13.096 --> 00:14.431
[light switch echoes]

00:16.099 --> 00:19.978
[Es]<i> The impetus to fill that hole</i>
<i>with art, to me, is fundamental.</i>

00:20.061 --> 00:22.147
[other-worldly music playing]

00:25.233 --> 00:28.945
[Es]<i> My canvas tends to be</i>
<i>devoid of light.</i>

00:31.781 --> 00:35.785
<i>You sort of do need to start</i>
<i>without light to find it.</i>

00:37.620 --> 00:39.706
[other-worldly music continues]

01:47.398 --> 01:50.527
[director] Here's my first question,
and I've been curious about this.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.863
Do you pronounce your name
"Ezz" or "Ess"?

01:53.947 --> 01:58.827
I pronounce my name "Ezz,"
because my name is short for Esmeralda.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.205
Often it's perceived
as being a man's name,

02:02.747 --> 02:07.752
so I do get reviews in Germany, which say,
"<i>Herr</i> Devlin's incredibly masculine work

02:07.836 --> 02:11.673
would have benefited from reading
the feminine aspects of the text."

02:11.756 --> 02:14.342
So, it's a useful,
neutral little name, actually, Es.

02:14.425 --> 02:18.263
I find it quite handy.
It's serving me quite well as a name.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.566
Every project starts exactly like this.

02:29.649 --> 02:34.320
Blank piece of paper, blank table,
there's usually one other person there.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.575
<i>Could be a director, or a playwright,</i>
<i>or the artist, if it's for a pop show.</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:40.869
<i>And a conversation happens,</i>

02:40.952 --> 02:43.788
<i>and I'd normally just start drawing</i>
<i>while we're talking.</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:49.669
<i>So, if I were to be having a conversation</i>
<i>about my own practice,</i>

02:49.752 --> 02:52.755
it would start with this one,

02:52.839 --> 02:56.342
with a little drawing
of a pair of scissors on it.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.137
'Cause you used to get those,
and you still do,

02:59.220 --> 03:00.889
on the back of a cornflakes packet,

03:00.972 --> 03:05.810
and it's an invitation to take
the piece of the cornflakes packet

03:05.894 --> 03:07.812
and cut it and make an intervention in it

03:07.896 --> 03:10.148
and change it
and turn it into something else.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.110
Like that, that will do.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.070
And then you hold it up to the light
and you go,

03:16.154 --> 03:18.573
"Oh, there's light
just coming through that bit that I cut!"

03:19.240 --> 03:20.366
So I like that one.

03:22.201 --> 03:25.288
I often get asked by people,
"How did you start doing what you do?"

03:25.371 --> 03:27.874
I often get asked by young,
like, 17-year-old people,

03:27.957 --> 03:29.250
who don't know what to do.

03:29.334 --> 03:33.838
And I always feel very empathetic
towards those 17-year-old people

03:33.922 --> 03:35.173
who say, "I don't know what to do."

03:36.424 --> 03:39.177
<i>I was no different to that,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do at all.</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:41.846
<i>But then I did a course in theater design</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:45.642
<i>and I found myself in this room full</i>
<i>of people making model stuff.</i>

03:46.100 --> 03:48.269
<i>I thought, "This is good,</i>
<i>these people are feral,</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:51.314
<i>and they stay up all night making models,</i>
<i>I feel quite at home here."</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:54.609
So, I did that.
I just made stuff for a year in this thing

03:54.692 --> 03:57.320
and then at the end of it,
I won this prize.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.243
<i>One of the first major shows</i>
<i>I was asked to do</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:05.828
was the Harold Pinter play<i>, Betrayal.</i>

04:07.288 --> 04:12.460
Big piece at the National Theatre
in London, so I threw everything at it.

04:13.628 --> 04:19.425
<i>And it says it's set in a bedroom,</i>
<i>a living room, a hotel room in Venice,</i>

04:19.509 --> 04:24.472
<i>and what I did is I overlaid</i>
<i>the ground plans of every scene</i>

04:24.555 --> 04:26.099
<i>with projections.</i>

04:26.724 --> 04:31.604
<i>And at that time, it was quite unusual</i>
<i>to use projection and film in theater.</i>

04:32.188 --> 04:34.857
<i>There wasn't really</i>
<i>an infrastructure for it to work.</i>

04:35.650 --> 04:39.696
And the point about that particular play
is it really doesn't need any of that.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.032
It does not need it.
It's a very happy play in a white box

04:43.116 --> 04:46.452
with a few white curtain changes
and furniture, it's happy that way.

04:46.536 --> 04:51.332
But that was me, I was doing my thing
and Harold Pinter was very sweet about it.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.960
'Cause he was quite excited
to see all this gadgetry,

04:54.043 --> 04:59.090
and, as a joke, he, on the first night,
introduced me to Antonia Fraser,

04:59.173 --> 05:01.676
his wife, Lady Antonia Fraser,

05:01.759 --> 05:03.803
and said, "This is Es,
she wrote the play."

05:04.595 --> 05:06.055
So that was sweet.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.141
[futuristic music playing]

05:09.517 --> 05:13.354
<i>The beginnings of my practice</i>
<i>were making small theater.</i>

05:14.105 --> 05:17.525
<i>You know, literally, there's an audience</i>
<i>of 78 at the Bush Theatre,</i>

05:17.608 --> 05:18.943
<i>which was where I first started working.</i>

05:20.486 --> 05:23.865
[Bradwell]<i> The Bush Theatre</i>
<i>is about the size of a matchbox.</i>

05:24.699 --> 05:27.160
What it was, was close-up magic.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.330
We created worlds
in a very, very tiny space.

05:32.290 --> 05:36.377
<i>How do you build a revolve</i>
<i>in a theater that seats 80 people?</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:39.338
<i>How do you do projections,</i>
<i>television screens?</i>

05:40.131 --> 05:42.050
<i>People were spending</i>
<i>a lot of money doing that.</i>

05:42.133 --> 05:45.053
We were spending
about four quid doing it out of junk

05:45.136 --> 05:48.431
and Es was working out how to do it,
every single step of the way.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.184
She'd paint the set,
she'd make the stuff, she'd weld.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.147
[Es]<i> I began to find what I wanted</i>
<i>to say quite quickly</i>

05:56.230 --> 05:57.315
<i>and quite quickly,</i>

05:57.398 --> 06:00.777
people who didn't like the kinds of things
I was doing stopped asking.

06:04.947 --> 06:09.660
<i>My practice has been following</i>
<i>my own paths of inquiry.</i>

06:11.496 --> 06:16.209
<i>And in order to practice,</i>
<i>I have found willing collaborators</i>

06:16.292 --> 06:20.713
<i>who I've been able to align my paths</i>
<i>of inquiry with.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:28.179
<i>From pop stars like Beyonc√©,</i>
<i>through to Wagner operas.</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:34.852
<i>The interesting thing about the process...</i>

06:34.936 --> 06:39.690
<i>I've learned that I don't actually</i>
<i>make anything or know what to make,</i>

06:39.774 --> 06:43.194
<i>until I know what the space is</i>
<i>that it's going to inhabit.</i>

06:43.820 --> 06:45.029
<i>'Cause as soon as you have a frame,</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:48.241
<i>of course the first thing you want to do</i>
<i>is start breaking out the edge of it.</i>

06:51.994 --> 06:55.331
The Faith Healer<i> is a series of monologues</i>

06:55.414 --> 06:58.417
<i>through rain, through sludge,</i>
<i>through bleakness.</i>

07:02.296 --> 07:06.592
<i>The interstitial gaps</i>
<i>between each monologue</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:11.180
<i>needed to evoke that itinerant bleakness.</i>

07:12.640 --> 07:17.478
<i>The rain fulfilled that need,</i>
<i>but also fulfilled a more practical need:</i>

07:17.562 --> 07:20.022
<i>we are in a theater</i>
<i>that does not have wings,</i>

07:20.106 --> 07:21.482
<i>does not have a fly tower.</i>

07:21.566 --> 07:23.526
<i>How do we change the scenery?</i>

07:26.362 --> 07:30.450
<i>We are using our rain box</i>
<i>like a curtain, practically.</i>

07:31.409 --> 07:33.244
<i>From the actors' point of view,</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:36.414
<i>they enjoy the way that they are</i>
<i>revealed and concealed</i>

07:36.497 --> 07:39.208
<i>at the beginning and the end</i>
<i>of each of their monologues.</i>

07:40.376 --> 07:46.591
This is a theater which has a brick wall
right behind what you see there,

07:46.674 --> 07:50.344
and the audience who come to this space
know that brick wall intimately,

07:50.428 --> 07:54.932
they're used to being confronted
with shallow space.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.897
<i>So to give them depth</i>
<i>and an element that is real.</i>

08:01.772 --> 08:07.528
<i>You can feel the audience feeling</i>
<i>the emotional response that anybody has</i>

08:07.612 --> 08:10.156
<i>towards lit rain in a small, dark room.</i>

08:11.657 --> 08:13.409
<i>And I'm satisfied.</i>

08:16.537 --> 08:18.956
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>I have no idea how the rain system works.</i>

08:19.040 --> 08:21.167
<i>It just shows</i>
<i>that you can design nice things</i>

08:21.250 --> 08:23.044
<i>without having a clue</i>
<i>how they fucking work.</i>

08:25.004 --> 08:30.218
Es is somebody who absolutely
amazes me every time we work.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.887
<i>I come back excited from meetings,</i>

08:32.970 --> 08:38.309
because she's always coming up
with information I would've never known

08:38.392 --> 08:42.188
or discovered by any other means.

08:42.271 --> 08:46.025
<i>A new stimulus every time,</i>
<i>many in a meeting.</i>

08:48.069 --> 08:50.863
[Es]<i> Normally, throughout the process</i>
<i>there will be a number of meetings.</i>

08:50.947 --> 08:53.157
<i>There might be five or there might be 25.</i>

08:53.741 --> 08:56.661
<i>And it might take a year</i>
<i>or three years or three months.</i>

08:58.037 --> 09:00.373
<i>I will have my team make models.</i>

09:00.456 --> 09:03.000
I will draw the kind of models
I think it's going to be,

09:03.084 --> 09:06.420
and then when I come back,
we've got a whole bunch of options.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.131
<i>Sometimes they're interesting.</i>
<i>Sometimes they're less interesting.</i>

09:09.215 --> 09:10.466
<i>We have another meeting,</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:12.593
we say, "We think it could be this,
it could be that..."

09:13.344 --> 09:16.138
<i>So you need to turn up with everything.</i>

09:17.431 --> 09:19.517
[upbeat music playing]

09:23.646 --> 09:27.525
[Es] This is actually probably
the most recent, and it's a rejected idea.

09:29.485 --> 09:34.824
He was drawn in Paris
in Karl Lagerfeld's studio,

09:34.907 --> 09:39.203
while Kanye West and Kim Kardashian
were being photographed on a bed.

09:40.997 --> 09:45.668
And I sat at the end of the bed
drawing ideas that Kanye was having

09:45.751 --> 09:50.047
and one of them was a man
made out of LED,

09:50.131 --> 09:53.759
<i>and this posture is the result</i>
<i>of many, many sketches.</i>

09:53.843 --> 09:55.886
<i>Because at first, he looked too strong,</i>

09:55.970 --> 09:57.847
<i>then he didn't look</i>
<i>sufficiently vulnerable.</i>

09:57.930 --> 10:01.684
<i>so we got to a sketch that he loved</i>
<i>on that day</i>

10:01.767 --> 10:02.977
and we made this model.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.148
And then we took it to Los Angeles
and it was hated instantly,

10:07.231 --> 10:08.691
so it came home in shame.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.901
And it's hanging its head in shame

10:10.985 --> 10:13.529
with a little parrot-headed man on it
to cheer it up.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.698
[laughs]

10:29.795 --> 10:31.172
-[Es] You have that...
-Mm-hmm.

10:31.255 --> 10:34.008
-[Es] I want a little doorway.
-Just flat?

10:34.091 --> 10:35.301
-Blank.
-Flush.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.552
-A flush door.
-Mm-hmm.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.678
[Es] And it can open.

10:37.762 --> 10:43.434
<i>I was invited to make a piece</i>
<i>for the Belgian </i>Triennale<i> Exhibition.</i>

10:44.769 --> 10:49.815
<i>It's an exhibition about</i>
<i>the relationship between music and art.</i>

10:49.899 --> 10:51.901
<i>A visual embodiment of music.</i>

10:51.984 --> 10:56.364
<i>And that's why I was invited to take part,</i>
<i>because of the work I've done in music.</i>

10:56.447 --> 10:57.990
You know what you could do?

10:58.699 --> 11:03.204
You could put the gauze there
and then have just a torn out area.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.749
So, I think that's quite elegant,
if you just stretch it.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.168
Yeah, I think that
would look really smart.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.839

<i>projecting images of some</i>
<i>of the shows I've made over 20 years.</i>

11:23.099 --> 11:25.184
I'll tell you
what my mind's going through:

11:25.267 --> 11:27.645
is whether it's interesting
to see the mess inside,

11:27.728 --> 11:30.439
or whether you want to keep it mysterious,
you know. That's the--

11:31.190 --> 11:32.400
That's the point.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.111
-Ta-da!
-Okay.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.036
<i>There's an element of terror,</i>

11:44.120 --> 11:48.499
because Kanye is not going to be there,
Beyonc√© is not going to be there.

11:48.582 --> 11:53.129
I've got to make something
that is worth watching on its own,

which I haven't really made before,
so we'll see.

This was a lovely Christmas present
Es gave us last year,

12:41.385 --> 12:46.724
and it's offcuts from a big set she did
in Dresden, and it's<i> Der Freisch√ºtz.</i>

12:46.807 --> 12:50.811
Another nice thing is we get to see
a lot of the stuff she does,

12:50.895 --> 12:54.982
so we're camp followers.
We are roadies, really. We go around.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.985

Yep. Old scaffolding boards.

I mean, 90% of the stuff in this house
is from junk shops

[Es]<i> My way of escaping or adventuring</i>

[violin music playing]

13:54.250 --> 13:58.963
[Es] <i>So music kind of was an entry point</i>
<i>into another tribe.</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:04.969
<i>And I have always enjoyed, since then,</i>
<i>being amongst the tribe of musicians.</i>

14:09.139 --> 14:10.391
I thought that bands, you see,

14:10.474 --> 14:12.977
'cause I had been going out
with a record producer,

14:13.060 --> 14:14.395
and we went to see lots of shows,

14:14.478 --> 14:17.064
and I always thought they were
visually desperately boring.

14:17.147 --> 14:20.109
Probably because I went to the wrong ones.
I didn't go to the fascinating ones.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.277
But they looked like this.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.530
People playing guitars here, guitars here,

14:24.613 --> 14:26.073
you might have had keyboards here,

14:26.156 --> 14:30.661
and then you sometimes had
a curtain or the band's name up here,

14:30.744 --> 14:33.455
or, if you were really lucky,
you might have had some projection.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.251
But that was pretty much
everything I saw in bands.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.295
And I didn't like this shape,

14:40.045 --> 14:42.715
'cause I thought it was
a humpbacked band shape.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.508
I was used to looking at opera
and theater,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.427
and I thought that was a mess.

14:46.510 --> 14:51.724
And I didn't like these lights up here
that just did "ri-ra-ra-ra" lighty things.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.434
I didn't like it.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.561
So, the first time I did a rock show,

14:55.644 --> 14:58.814
I said, "Why don't we put
them all in their own little box?"

14:59.398 --> 15:03.110
You can go in here, Mr. Drummer.
You can go in here, Mr. Guitarist.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.528
The singer can go in here...

15:06.155 --> 15:08.240
[rock music playing]

15:10.034 --> 15:14.914
[Es] I put a gauze on the front,
like this, which is a kind of netting,

15:14.997 --> 15:17.541
and I put a mirror all over the sides.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.419
A very cheap, crap mirror
'cause I didn't have much money.

15:20.878 --> 15:25.257
<i>And my idea was to sort of deconstruct</i>
<i>the anatomy of this four-piece band.</i>

15:25.341 --> 15:29.678
So you just saw the vocalist's mouth,
the drummer's nose,

15:29.762 --> 15:33.766
the guitarist's eye
and the bass player's ear.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.852
But, in my excitement,

15:36.936 --> 15:40.022
I neglected to remember
that this was their farewell gig

15:40.105 --> 15:42.358
and they would need to take a bow

15:42.441 --> 15:44.985
and step out and be seen
by their adoring fans.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.737
[applause]

15:46.820 --> 15:49.823
<i>So, I just stapled this front gauze on</i>
<i>and also, once they're in,</i>

15:49.907 --> 15:53.953
<i>I stapled the rear projection screen on,</i>
<i>so they actually couldn't get out.</i>

15:55.996 --> 15:58.457
People tell me I should
watch a film called<i> Spinal Tap,</i>

15:58.540 --> 15:59.458
but I've never seen it

15:59.541 --> 16:01.418
and I don't intend to
at this point in my life,

16:01.502 --> 16:03.337
because everyone says
my life is too similar to it.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.297
So I'm never watching that film. Sorry.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.926
And this is what Kanye saw

16:09.009 --> 16:11.804
when he was in the middle
of sacking his set designer,

16:11.887 --> 16:14.181
and my friend heard him
sacking his set designer

16:14.264 --> 16:16.684
and said,
"Look at this. She's just done this."

16:17.017 --> 16:20.020
And Kanye said, "Oh goody, goody!
I'll have one of those."

16:20.104 --> 16:21.563
So that's how it all started.

[Es]<i> What can this artifice</i>

<i>How can something pretend,</i>

16:39.164 --> 16:44.920

16:47.923 --> 16:49.758
<i>like Take That's giant man.</i>

16:51.760 --> 16:54.847
<i>The question of "Why?" endures throughout.</i>

16:56.765 --> 17:00.561
<i>Why did we want that slice of light</i>
<i>through the middle of Beyonc√©'s cube?</i>

17:01.061 --> 17:03.814
<i>Why did we want that circle of light</i>

17:04.440 --> 17:09.611
<i>Why did we want that block of light</i>
<i>in the middle of the arena for U2's tour?</i>

17:09.695 --> 17:11.155
<i>In fact the U2 show,</i>

17:11.238 --> 17:14.575
the whole conversation we had
was a journey from a square to a circle.

17:15.451 --> 17:20.164
<i>From the home, to the world,</i>
<i>and that stage ended up actually being</i>

17:20.247 --> 17:22.666
<i>a journey from a square stage</i>
<i>to a circular stage.</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:29.006
<i>What I tend to be most interested in</i>
<i>is the psychology of a space.</i>

17:30.799 --> 17:35.304
<i>A lot of my work now</i>
<i>is about finding environments for music.</i>

17:38.682 --> 17:40.934
<i>And there's a lot more freedom,</i>
<i>I would say,</i>

17:41.018 --> 17:43.353
<i>because many lyrics are already poetry.</i>

17:43.437 --> 17:46.940
<i>So I guess I'm designing for poetry</i>
<i>to happen in, more often than prose.</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:52.905
<i>I really quite methodically go,</i>
<i>"Okay, let's listen to the lyrics,</i>

17:52.988 --> 17:55.657
<i>let's write down the lyrics</i>
<i>that we respond to,</i>

17:55.741 --> 17:58.619
<i>let's try and find a poetry,</i>
<i>let's try and find a story."</i>

17:58.702 --> 18:03.916
<i>And each time an actor or a singer</i>
<i>sings or says a word...</i>

18:03.999 --> 18:06.710
<i>‚ô™ Blossom's fallin' from a tree ‚ô™</i>

18:06.794 --> 18:07.711
<i>that's another question:</i>

18:07.795 --> 18:09.797
<i>what should be around them</i>
<i>while they're saying this?</i>

18:09.880 --> 18:13.634
<i>What would support or counterpoint</i>
<i>what they're doing?</i>

18:14.218 --> 18:17.179
So, it's really complex,
there are a lot of parts to it.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.264
[futuristic music playing]

18:23.352 --> 18:25.354
<i>In spaces where I make things,</i>

18:25.437 --> 18:30.359
I can find light and scratch out light
and shape things to allow light in.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.903
<i>Like the U2 show.</i>

18:35.405 --> 18:39.493
<i>We found magic tricks</i>
<i>that work best to control light.</i>

18:41.995 --> 18:43.622
<i>For example, a mirror.</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:51.964
<i>The first time I used a piece of mirror</i>
<i>would've been </i>Macbeth<i>,</i>

18:52.047 --> 18:54.216
<i>where we sliced a box in half with mirror</i>

18:54.299 --> 18:56.426
<i>and we were able to see</i>
<i>one half of this table,</i>

18:56.510 --> 19:00.097
<i>with and without the ghost of Banquo</i>
<i>as it revolved.</i>

19:00.681 --> 19:02.933
<i>And it behaved as his psychological space,</i>

19:03.016 --> 19:07.104
<i>as a metaphor for the tricks</i>
<i>that were being played on him.</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:12.693
And then recently I used a mirror
on a piece called<i> The Nether,</i>

19:13.485 --> 19:18.365
<i>which was about a world created digitally.</i>

19:18.448 --> 19:22.911
<i>So I somehow needed to make the audience</i>
<i>not trust their environment.</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:25.831
<i>So what was interesting is people</i>
<i>who came out of that play</i>

19:25.914 --> 19:29.751
<i>described having seen a glass box,</i>
<i>but actually, there was no box.</i>

19:29.835 --> 19:31.628
<i>There was nothing there,</i>

19:31.712 --> 19:36.842
<i>it was just objects placed in space</i>
<i>with a mirror set quite far behind them,</i>

19:36.925 --> 19:40.220
<i>so the audience's depth perception</i>
<i>was really messed about with</i>

19:40.304 --> 19:42.014
<i>so they thought they were reading a box</i>

19:42.097 --> 19:45.517
<i>and they were just reading objects</i>
<i>in relation to an invisible box.</i>

19:46.602 --> 19:51.356
And I use mirror a lot in the fashion
shows I've been doing with Louis Vuitton.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.945
<i>This is a new discovery</i>
<i>of a transparent, two-way mirror</i>

19:57.446 --> 20:00.574
<i>that is mirror whenever</i>
<i>there is not light behind it.</i>

20:01.408 --> 20:04.995
<i>So, if you put a piece of LED screen</i>
<i>behind a piece of two-way mirror,</i>

20:05.078 --> 20:09.833
<i>then if you conjure a face</i>
<i>against black behind mirror,</i>

20:09.917 --> 20:14.254
<i>then the mirror will reflect the room</i>
<i>everywhere except where the face is,</i>

20:14.338 --> 20:19.551
<i>so you effectively see a suspended face</i>
<i>amidst a huge double sized room.</i>

20:21.261 --> 20:23.222
I'm making more immersive pieces

20:23.305 --> 20:25.891

20:45.285 --> 20:47.454
<i>I came up with a mirrored maze,</i>

<i>that was a good analog</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:55.003
<i>for the frontal brain making</i>
<i>50,000 decisions a minute.</i>

20:57.839 --> 21:02.511
<i>And then suddenly allow them</i>
<i>into a room where the floor falls away</i>

21:02.594 --> 21:03.720
<i>and they plummet.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:08.475
<i>Then you'd be creating</i>
<i>a sculptural physical analog</i>

21:08.892 --> 21:13.438
<i>for how it feels to be</i>
<i>plummeted back in time to a memory,</i>

21:13.522 --> 21:16.942
<i>in the way that you do when you</i>

<i>is it's a very small, little parish.</i>

21:49.558 --> 21:53.145
<i>And yet, there are</i>
<i>11 stained glass windows here,</i>

21:53.228 --> 21:55.564
<i>which were designed by Marc Chagall.</i>

21:56.398 --> 21:58.317
<i>Which is an extraordinary thing, I think.</i>

[Es] <i>A local member of the parish council,</i>

<i>tragically in 1963.</i>

<i>She was 21.</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:24.801
<i>In memory of her,</i>
<i>he commissioned these windows.</i>

22:24.885 --> 22:29.347
When Chagall came here
and saw this window in situ,

22:29.431 --> 22:32.976
he said, "Okay, I need to do
the whole church."

22:33.060 --> 22:39.232
So over the next ten years, he created
the rest of the windows, one by one.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.860
[piano playing continues]

22:45.030 --> 22:48.325
<i>There was a big Chagall exhibition</i>
<i>in the early '80s,</i>

22:53.872 --> 22:56.500
<i>and also joined it together</i>
<i>with seeing these windows.</i>

22:57.167 --> 23:01.880
<i>So this feels like</i>
<i>paint turned into light.</i>

23:02.714 --> 23:06.927
The intensity of that cobalt
and ultramarine and cyan,

23:07.010 --> 23:10.180
all those different blues
that are going on together in that,

23:10.263 --> 23:13.600
is something that I would've seen in paint
and then I would've come here

23:13.683 --> 23:16.728
and realized what happens
when you pour light through it

23:16.812 --> 23:20.023
and look at the refractions
that are coming off it on the wall there.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.234
And the fact that this guy...
There's his name.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.944
You know, he was here.

23:24.569 --> 23:28.365
It reminds you that artists all have to
come from somewhere, however small.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.367
[birdsong]

23:30.450 --> 23:33.954
What strikes me about these windows is,
from the inside,

23:34.037 --> 23:35.747
they are this glorious,

23:35.831 --> 23:41.044
jewel-like emanating source

But look at them here, they're black.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.882
It's waiting to be brought to life.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.093
It's how I feel
at the beginning of a show,

23:48.176 --> 23:50.720
before the lights come up
on a piece of scenery.

23:53.098 --> 23:57.894
<i>The turning of the lights out</i>
<i>at the start of a performance</i>

<i>does get rerehearsed.</i>

24:22.419 --> 24:24.713
There's 80,000 people

24:25.422 --> 24:27.382
That's the same as
what happened at Stonehenge,

24:27.465 --> 24:30.010
before there were any Christians here,
but there were druids.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.640
<i>Something happens at that point</i>
<i>in the show, because there's a change.</i>

24:38.101 --> 24:42.439
They have all come to focus
their gaze on one person.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.150
We don't need to say worship,

24:45.233 --> 24:51.239
but all the energy of the room
is focused on that one little individual,

[Es] <i>I worked with Beyonc√©</i>

terribly dissimilar to this in some ways.

25:15.931 --> 25:22.145
It's a cuboid, but it does open
with this slit, this aperture of light.

25:23.063 --> 25:27.442
When she was a child,
she spoke to a TV preacher

25:28.026 --> 25:31.738
and the preacher said to her,
"Put your hand on the TV,"

25:32.489 --> 25:35.742
and she felt the sensation of prayer.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.621
<i>I think it was the combination</i>
<i>in a child's mind of what a TV does</i>

25:39.704 --> 25:45.418
<i>and what the language</i>
<i>and tone of prayer feels like.</i>

25:46.294 --> 25:52.008
<i>And later she realized</i>
<i>this big revolving block of her</i>

25:52.092 --> 25:55.011
<i>is another way of broadcasting</i>
<i>her and what she's saying.</i>

25:57.764 --> 26:02.519
If you look at most concerts before 2003,

26:03.395 --> 26:07.148
most of the photos were done by
professional photographers near the front

26:07.232 --> 26:09.526
and you'll see a big god-like image
of the pop star

26:09.609 --> 26:11.069
and a load of lights behind.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.238
<i>And that's how the imagery was recorded</i>

26:13.321 --> 26:16.992
and that's how most people who didn't go
would perceive the show.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.037
So cut to cameras on phones...

26:21.121 --> 26:27.627
<i>Suddenly that event is being recorded</i>
<i>from every angle</i>

26:28.211 --> 26:30.839
<i>and therefore my work</i>
<i>is suddenly being seen from every angle</i>

<i>and being understood in a different way.</i>

26:32.882 --> 26:34.050
<i>So it's a big shift.</i>

26:35.927 --> 26:41.224
<i>The artists I'm working with are bombarded</i>

26:41.308 --> 26:43.727
<i>They know their show</i>
<i>like they never knew it.</i>

26:44.352 --> 26:48.023
They're aware that how many people
will perceive this show

26:48.106 --> 26:49.941
will be via those media,

26:50.025 --> 26:54.029
so, to a degree, we're designing
to a square at the moment.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.117
That will probably change. Instagram
might suddenly become a triangle.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.039
<i>The more I practice</i>

27:04.122 --> 27:07.625
<i>and the more I begin to be</i>
<i>more self-reflective in the practice,</i>

27:07.709 --> 27:09.961
<i>which is happening now, really,</i>

27:10.754 --> 27:13.548
<i>then I begin to ask: why do I need</i>
<i>to engage with these people?</i>

27:13.631 --> 27:16.551
<i>What relevance is this work to me?</i>

27:16.634 --> 27:19.137
<i>Why do I need to...</i>
<i>What can I bring to it?</i>

27:22.182 --> 27:23.475
<i>It's interesting, isn't it,</i>

27:23.558 --> 27:27.520
<i>because the word "show" suggests</i>
<i>that you're revealing something.</i>

27:28.855 --> 27:30.732
<i>It doesn't suggest finding.</i>

27:34.277 --> 27:35.320
What would be nice...

27:35.403 --> 27:37.489
<i>And because I do what I do every day,</i>

27:37.572 --> 27:42.410
<i>I have to make sure the showing of things</i>
<i>is in itself the seeking for things.</i>

27:42.911 --> 27:45.038
-Make it a little bit more punchy.
-OK.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.374
[Es] Yay! Oh yes!

27:48.249 --> 27:49.250
<i>What would you have to show</i>

27:49.334 --> 27:51.544
<i>if you hadn't been looking</i>
<i>and finding and seeking?</i>

27:51.628 --> 27:54.464
This is going on a truck tomorrow night,
going to Belgium.

27:55.632 --> 28:00.804
<i>So I looked at some footage of babies</i>
<i>playing with those sorting boxes,</i>

28:00.887 --> 28:05.183
<i>where you pick up a triangle,</i>
<i>you pick up a circle, you pick up a square</i>

28:05.266 --> 28:08.186
<i>and you try to slot it through</i>
<i>different apertures in the box.</i>

28:09.145 --> 28:10.980
<i>It's actually</i>
<i>extraordinary footage to watch,</i>

28:11.064 --> 28:14.484
<i>because what's happening in their brain</i>
<i>is every time they discover something new,</i>

28:14.567 --> 28:16.194
<i>they're getting a little dopamine rush,</i>

28:16.277 --> 28:19.864
<i>which is why we're biologically selected</i>
<i>to be in love with new things.</i>

28:21.574 --> 28:22.826
<i>This baby literally,</i>

28:22.909 --> 28:25.829
<i>either when it does go through</i>
<i>or when it doesn't go through,</i>

28:25.912 --> 28:28.415
<i>either of those instances</i>
<i>is a new sensation,</i>

28:28.498 --> 28:29.999
<i>and it gets a little reward.</i>

28:30.917 --> 28:33.753
<i>That baby is the equivalent of me here</i>

28:33.837 --> 28:37.006
<i>or in a stadium with Beyonc√©,</i>
<i>whatever it is.</i>

28:37.090 --> 28:39.426
<i>It's literally what's going on</i>
<i>in that little baby's brain,</i>

28:39.509 --> 28:40.552
<i>loving that.</i>

28:43.638 --> 28:45.432
<i>That's what this box is about, really.</i>

28:46.182 --> 28:49.477
<i>I have been trying</i>
<i>to fit different projects</i>

28:49.561 --> 28:52.272
<i>through different apertures</i>
<i>in my own little practice.</i>

28:52.355 --> 28:54.190
<i>It's a little retrospective.</i>

29:00.196 --> 29:02.449
<i>This is Rye, in East Sussex.</i>

29:02.532 --> 29:05.702
<i>We moved here when I was six,</i>
<i>and we lived here till I was 13.</i>

29:06.786 --> 29:11.458
<i>And it happens to have in its town center,</i>
<i>a model of this town.</i>

29:16.463 --> 29:19.758
<i>The model tells stories,</i>
<i>which I was very captivated by.</i>

29:20.383 --> 29:22.677
<i>A ghost story, or a fable,</i>

29:22.761 --> 29:27.056
<i>or the story of a butcher</i>
<i>who killed a mayor.</i>

29:28.725 --> 29:32.812
<i>My house is just there,</i>
<i>and the roof is actually a pair of roofs.</i>

29:33.480 --> 29:36.900
And I used to climb out
and sit in the little V out on that roof

29:36.983 --> 29:38.485
and look out over the town.

29:39.694 --> 29:44.282
<i>I started to associate storytelling</i>
<i>with models.</i>

29:45.366 --> 29:49.204
The systems and influences

29:49.287 --> 29:52.373
of one's childhood are inescapable.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.127
<i>There's something about this</i>
<i>that I'm absolutely drawn to,</i>

29:56.211 --> 29:58.797
<i>and my mind mentally enters</i>
<i>all of its streets.</i>

29:58.880 --> 30:02.133
But there is another part of me that does
sort of wonder what would happen

30:02.217 --> 30:04.427
if you just picked them up
and smashed them apart.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.555
<i>You know, what if you put in</i>
<i>something really subversive</i>

30:07.639 --> 30:09.182
or poured some paint over it?

30:11.351 --> 30:14.312
<i>My work is as much a reaction against this</i>

30:14.395 --> 30:17.607
<i>as it is continuing to perpetuate</i>
<i>the influence of this.</i>

30:22.904 --> 30:26.574
<i>You can perceive the systems of a city</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:29.452
and the history of a city,
when you look down on it.

30:29.536 --> 30:33.248
The roads that were built
on top of the other roads,

30:33.331 --> 30:34.791
<i>the periods of time...</i>

30:36.042 --> 30:40.630
<i>So how I often use model cities</i>
<i>is I don't put them on the floor,</i>

30:40.713 --> 30:41.881
<i>I put them on the wall.</i>

30:42.799 --> 30:46.761
<i>Which puts the audience on the ceiling,</i>
<i>which I find fun,</i>

30:46.845 --> 30:49.097
and people do feel something
when they look down.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.432
We feel something here, I think,

30:51.516 --> 30:55.687
and if you can bring this feeling
into a black box theater, that's exciting.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.856
<i>I play with scale.</i>

30:57.939 --> 31:02.944
<i>Scale is one of my ingredients, I guess,</i>
<i>just literally practically in my studio.</i>

31:03.027 --> 31:05.029
<i>I have people of all different heights.</i>

31:06.281 --> 31:10.201
<i>And one of the things</i>
<i>that I enjoy in my practice</i>

31:10.285 --> 31:15.456
<i>is to position a human, huge or tiny,</i>
<i>in relation to the same object.</i>

31:18.793 --> 31:21.713
<i>Recently, on the Adele show,</i>

31:21.796 --> 31:24.591
<i>her makeup artist</i>
<i>became our scenic painter</i>

31:24.674 --> 31:27.218
<i>because we knew that her eye</i>
<i>would be this big</i>

31:27.302 --> 31:30.471
<i>and that bit of mascara</i>
<i>would interact with her hand here.</i>

31:33.600 --> 31:35.810
<i>When I look over this particular city,</i>

31:35.894 --> 31:38.855
<i>I play a little time-lapse</i>
<i>of my own journeys through it,</i>

31:38.938 --> 31:42.400
<i>my own arrival on that train</i>
<i>when I was a kid,</i>

31:42.483 --> 31:46.029
<i>the number of times I walked up and down</i>
<i>Tottenham Court Road,</i>

31:46.112 --> 31:48.114
<i>when I worked in a bookshop there...</i>

31:48.573 --> 31:51.409
<i>Perceiving the system,</i>
<i>finding the systems,</i>

31:51.492 --> 31:53.536
<i>finding the patterns I guess, isn't it?</i>

31:53.620 --> 31:57.290
It's much easier to find a pattern
if you're looking down on something.

32:03.129 --> 32:06.591
<i>This is another pair of artists</i>
<i>that I collaborate with.</i>

32:07.216 --> 32:09.594
<i>Kanye and Jay Z, for </i>Watch the Throne<i>.</i>

32:13.097 --> 32:15.642
<i>Once we said, "Okay, 'Throne.'</i>

32:17.560 --> 32:20.438
<i>What does 'Throne'</i>
<i>actually mean in this context?"</i>

32:21.356 --> 32:23.483
<i>And really it's about,</i>

32:23.566 --> 32:26.361
once you've found yourself
in the exalted position,

32:26.819 --> 32:30.865
then the next thing
is the anxiety about losing that position.

32:31.532 --> 32:36.412
<i>So they're at once</i>
<i>in positions of almighty power,</i>

32:36.496 --> 32:38.206
<i>because they're 15 foot up.</i>

32:39.165 --> 32:41.626
<i>But they're also vulnerable,</i>
<i>because they're standing up there</i>

32:41.709 --> 32:44.963
<i>and they could easily be shot or fall off.</i>

32:45.797 --> 32:48.841
<i>And they're alone, they kind of look</i>
<i>very lost and alone up there,</i>

32:48.925 --> 32:52.345
<i>so it's a combination of power</i>
<i>and vulnerability again, I guess.</i>

32:55.390 --> 33:00.853
<i>That tension between power and fallibility</i>

33:00.937 --> 33:03.147
<i>is very fascinating territory.</i>

33:05.316 --> 33:06.401
I'm not scared.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.570
Just in case you're wondering.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.863
[laughs]

33:11.614 --> 33:12.782
I'm not scared.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.744
[Warner] <i>Es, without any doubt</i>
<i>in my mind,</i>

33:16.828 --> 33:21.165
is the most driven human being
I have ever met in my life.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.918
You know, in fact, you know,
she is so driven,

33:24.002 --> 33:26.421
I think her imagination
needs its own chauffeur.

33:30.466 --> 33:33.928
<i>But it's not ambition in a normal sense;</i>

33:34.012 --> 33:37.390
<i>it's really about</i>
<i>exploring the imagination.</i>

33:37.473 --> 33:38.516
[chime music playing]

33:40.810 --> 33:47.233
<i>And there is quality in Beethoven</i>
<i>and Wagner and Shakespeare and Pinter,</i>

33:47.316 --> 33:50.570
<i>which perhaps there isn't in other fields.</i>

33:51.696 --> 33:54.240
<i>And I've got a feeling</i>
<i>that deeply inside Es,</i>

33:54.323 --> 33:57.660
the quality has got to win through.

34:00.455 --> 34:05.543
This was made for<i> Don Giovanni,</i>
which is called the graveyard of designers

34:05.626 --> 34:09.672
'cause it's a notoriously hard piece
to design for precisely that reason

34:09.756 --> 34:15.386
<i>that it's very specific about people</i>
<i>getting stuck in corridors in the dark,</i>

34:15.470 --> 34:18.931
<i>so if you don't provide the necessary</i>
<i>doors for all of that to go off,</i>

34:19.515 --> 34:20.933
<i>it actually doesn't work.</i>

34:22.185 --> 34:24.228
So, we made a revolving box.

34:24.312 --> 34:28.149
It's a kind of maze.
All of these doors could slide.

34:28.232 --> 34:32.320
All of this could be completely closed
or any bit of it could slide or open,

34:32.403 --> 34:36.032
so it was like
an ever-changing architecture.

34:37.950 --> 34:41.788
<i>It was projected on, on all sides,</i>
<i>with a mapping system.</i>

34:45.249 --> 34:49.337
<i>When you make kinetic pieces of scenery,</i>
<i>it's very exciting to an audience.</i>

34:50.254 --> 34:54.592
She always came up with things
that made me think about things anew.

34:54.675 --> 34:58.137
And she talked about
the democracy of the theater.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.515
<i>If you've got 20 people on stage,</i>

35:00.598 --> 35:03.142
<i>you cannot control</i>
<i>where the audience looks.</i>

35:03.684 --> 35:05.645
<i>The theater demands that democracy,</i>

35:05.728 --> 35:08.648
<i>where you're making sure everybody</i>
<i>from the top of the house,</i>

35:08.731 --> 35:11.400
<i>to the bottom of the house</i>
<i>is getting an experience.</i>

35:12.860 --> 35:15.530
[Es]<i> The rook in Wagner's </i>Parsifal<i>.</i>

35:16.405 --> 35:18.741
<i>What happens throughout the piece</i>
<i>is it turns</i>

35:18.825 --> 35:20.827
<i>and you see it from every angle.</i>

35:22.161 --> 35:27.166
<i>The reason we chose the rook was because</i>
<i>it's a symbol that everybody recognizes.</i>

35:27.667 --> 35:32.255
<i>It's not necessary</i>
<i>for the audience to know every detail.</i>

35:32.338 --> 35:35.716
<i>It's actually more helpful</i>
<i>to create an object</i>

35:35.800 --> 35:37.844
<i>that, for everybody, has meaning.</i>

35:39.762 --> 35:42.473
<i>For example, how you feel in a tunnel.</i>

35:42.557 --> 35:45.810
<i>I think there are just</i>
<i>these absolutely basic, atavistic,</i>

35:45.893 --> 35:47.645
<i>primal responses we all have</i>

35:47.728 --> 35:50.189
<i>to being in a dark, curved tunnel space.</i>

35:52.275 --> 35:57.488
<i>So I do think, on everybody,</i>
<i>there's an emotional response to that.</i>

35:58.906 --> 36:02.243
But the things that I create
are not the things.

36:03.661 --> 36:07.582
They are the time
that the people at the show spend

36:07.665 --> 36:09.333
in the company of the things.

36:09.876 --> 36:13.129
So it's time that you're making, really.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.673
<i>Time perceived by an audience.</i>

36:15.756 --> 36:17.133
[pulsating sounds playing]

36:17.675 --> 36:22.346
<i>The objects themselves</i>
<i>are not what you think they are.</i>

36:23.472 --> 36:25.975
<i>What I am trying to say is</i>
<i>if you were to keep the things I make</i>

36:26.058 --> 36:27.226
<i>and put them in an art gallery,</i>

36:27.310 --> 36:31.522
they wouldn't be behaving
as they were designed to behave.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.233
They can only do that in time.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.944
<i>Reflecting the light and projections</i>
<i>in different ways,</i>

36:37.028 --> 36:38.404
<i>with different people inside them,</i>

36:38.487 --> 36:41.199
<i>saying different words</i>
<i>with different sound effects.</i>

36:42.408 --> 36:45.661
<i>With </i>Hamlet<i>, we made</i>
<i>a very specific timeline.</i>

36:46.871 --> 36:49.248
<i>We read the pages of the script,</i>

36:49.332 --> 36:53.669
<i>and we literally make a chart,</i>
<i>second by second, page by page.</i>

36:53.753 --> 36:55.880
<i>What is happening? Who is saying what?</i>

36:56.923 --> 36:59.008
<i>As I start to shade things in,</i>

36:59.091 --> 37:02.261
<i>what I'm always thinking about</i>
<i>is how the audience will feel.</i>

37:03.304 --> 37:06.807
<i>How long will they experience this for</i>
<i>and then what will happen next?</i>

37:07.391 --> 37:09.560
<i>Everything else is sort of serving that.</i>

37:12.313 --> 37:14.941
[Bradwell] <i>The design you see</i>
<i>is the tip of the iceberg.</i>

37:15.024 --> 37:18.819
But the amount of work you do
to provide that tip of the iceberg

37:18.903 --> 37:20.154
is what's important.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.656
It will hold you up.

37:24.909 --> 37:29.872
<i>When I was a child, what I'm doing</i>
<i>right now was my idea of utter heaven.</i>

37:29.956 --> 37:33.125
<i>This was pretty much what I wanted to do.</i>

37:34.126 --> 37:35.920
<i>But yeah, obviously now,</i>

37:36.003 --> 37:41.968
the things I make are a little bit more
contemporary than a Pollock's toy theater.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.553
But, you know, look,
you're already doing surrealism.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.264
I'm just doing that, look,

37:46.347 --> 37:47.431
or I'm doing this.

37:49.308 --> 37:55.231
<i>With </i>Hamlet<i>, we made a very specific copy</i>
<i>of an Edwardian stately home,</i>

37:55.314 --> 38:00.069
<i>and it had to be that specific</i>
<i>and that real and naturalistic,</i>

38:00.152 --> 38:07.034
<i>so that we could then violate it</i>
<i>with an influx of black poisonous earth.</i>

38:08.494 --> 38:11.664
<i>So sometimes, as in the rules</i>
<i>of a surreal painting,</i>

38:12.164 --> 38:14.500
surrealism works because there's reality.
