WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:06.006
SO TRAV ASKED ME
IF I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROBLEM

00:06.006 --> 00:09.080
THAT ALL WE DO ON THE WEEKENDS
IS SIT AROUND AND DRINK WINE.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.341
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA. WAIT.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.143
ARE WE ONLY DRINKING
ON THE WEEKENDS NOW?

00:12.143 --> 00:14.445
BECAUSE WE NEED TO VOTE ON THAT.
GUYS?

00:14.445 --> 00:16.047
(all) NO!

00:16.047 --> 00:17.148
WOW. DEMOCRACY WORKS.

00:17.148 --> 00:19.250
BUT STILL,
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T JUST SIT

00:19.250 --> 00:22.693
WITH OUR WINE GLASSES
IN OUR HANDS, DOING NOTHING.

00:22.693 --> 00:24.055
YOU KNOW? SO...

00:24.055 --> 00:28.159
I GOT US THESE. NOW OUR HANDS
ARE FREE TO DO STUFF.

00:28.159 --> 00:30.331
BUT I-I LIKED HOLDING MY GLASS.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.462
I FEEL LIKE AN ANIMAL.

00:31.462 --> 00:33.134
GET IT OFF! HATE IT!

00:33.134 --> 00:35.206
OKAY. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
GUYS, WAIT.
FINE.

00:35.206 --> 00:36.667
WHAT IF WE THINK
OF THESE NECKLACES

00:36.667 --> 00:38.209
AS OUR "ON DECK CIRCLE"?

00:38.209 --> 00:40.711
HMM? THAT WAY, WE DON'T
HAVE TO GET UP SO MUCH.

00:40.711 --> 00:42.373
I DON'T LIKE GETTING UP.

00:42.373 --> 00:44.044
CHEERS, EVERYONE.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.417
(glasses clink)

00:46.417 --> 00:51.482
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:51.482 --> 00:54.485
(indistinct conversations)

01:01.092 --> 01:04.195
WOW. THAT'S SOME PRETTY SERIOUS
P.D.A. FOR YOU.

01:04.195 --> 01:05.666
WHAT CAN I SAY?
YOU BRING IT OUT IN ME.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.268
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.300
WHEN--WHEN WE FIRST MET,
DID YOU, UM,

01:09.300 --> 01:11.272
DID YOU SEE US
FALLING IN LOVE?

01:11.272 --> 01:12.703
(chuckles)NO.

01:13.744 --> 01:15.276
YES.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.148
ALL I WANNA DO IS
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

01:17.148 --> 01:18.649
REALLY? MAYBE TONIGHT,
YOU'LL--

01:18.649 --> 01:20.751
IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX, BABE.
OH.

01:20.751 --> 01:22.082
BUT I WANT YOU TO TRY
TO KEEP LISTENING.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.215
I'LL TRY MY BEST.

01:24.215 --> 01:28.219
PROMISE ME THAT WE'LL ALWAYS
SURPRISE EACH OTHER.

01:28.219 --> 01:29.220
(skateboard wheels rattling)

01:29.220 --> 01:30.791
ALL I REALLY WANT

01:30.791 --> 01:33.464
IS A LIFE...

01:33.464 --> 01:35.266
FULL OF SURPRISES.

01:35.266 --> 01:37.097
YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE
A HUGE SURPRISE?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.769
IS IF YOU DIDN'T MESS
WITH THESE KIDS RIGHT NOW.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.671
(chuckles) RIGHT?
HEY, FELLAS.

01:40.671 --> 01:43.274
I'M TRYING TO TALK
TO MY MAN HERE.

01:43.274 --> 01:46.507
SO COULD YOU TAKE THAT THRASHIN'
DOWN TO THE PARK?

01:46.507 --> 01:47.678
PFFT.

01:47.678 --> 01:48.839
PFFT!
(boy) WHATEVER, LADY.

01:48.839 --> 01:50.611
HEY, NONE OF YOU ARE
GONNA HAVE GIRLFRIENDS

01:50.611 --> 01:54.215
UNLESS YOU CUT YOUR HAIR
AND TAKE A SHOWER!

01:54.215 --> 01:55.846
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

01:55.846 --> 01:58.449
I WAS CRAZY ABOUT DIRTY
LONG-HAIRS. NOW WHERE WERE WE?

01:58.449 --> 01:59.820
SURPRISES.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.224
RIGHT. LOVE 'EM. WANT 'EM.
LOCK IT DOWN.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.625
(sighs)

02:06.797 --> 02:09.230
OKAY, WITHOUT LAURIE
OR BOBBY HERE,

02:09.230 --> 02:12.903
IT'S JUST NOT AS CRAMPED
OR STUPID OR NOISY.

02:12.903 --> 02:15.636
I'LL JUST SAY IT--I THINK
THIS SHOULD BE THE GANG.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.867
TOO MEAN, BABE.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.709
I KNOW.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.811
(whispers)
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE THE GANG.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.343
I HEARD THAT!

02:22.343 --> 02:24.144
(normal voice) GOOD.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.577
(loud clomping)

02:26.577 --> 02:29.420
NOTHING ON TWO LEGS
SHOULD WALK THAT LOUD.

02:29.420 --> 02:34.255
IT'S JUST HARD TO WALK
WITH A STUPID ANKLE MONITOR.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.187
SERIOUSLY, JULES,

02:36.187 --> 02:39.290
THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
HASSLED THOSE SKATEBOARDERS.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.362
LAST MONTH, I WAS IN REAL NEED

02:41.362 --> 02:43.694
OF A SPIRITUAL,
SOUL-CLEANSING JOURNEY,

02:43.694 --> 02:47.238
BUT OF COURSE, I DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH CASH TO FLY TO INDIA.

02:47.238 --> 02:50.301
SO I JUST DROVE NORTH.
IT WAS TOTAL "EAT, PRAY, TAMPA."

02:50.301 --> 02:51.472
ANYWAY,

02:51.472 --> 02:54.505
I LET THIS CUTE-ISH BARTENDER
TRADE ME FREE DRINKS...

02:54.505 --> 02:56.847
(clenched teeth)
FOR A LITTLE ACTION UPSTAIRS...

02:56.847 --> 02:58.849
(normal voice)
AND HIS EX-WIFE SHOWED UP.

02:58.849 --> 03:01.252
I SHOULD'VE MINDED
MY OWN BUSINESS, BUT DID I?

03:01.252 --> 03:02.253
DON'T CARE.

03:02.253 --> 03:04.315
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE IS KICKING ME,

03:04.315 --> 03:05.856
BUT I HAVE GOT...

03:05.856 --> 03:08.188
THIS VERY HEEL IN MY HAND,

03:08.188 --> 03:10.190
AND I AM POPPING HER EARDRUM.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.863
WA-POOM! WA-POOM!

03:12.863 --> 03:14.595
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN
THAT ROAD, HONEY.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.297
NOT A HUGE WORRY FOR ME.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.430
I KNEW YOU WOULD MESS
WITH THOSE SKATE RATS.

03:19.430 --> 03:20.771
MM-HMM.
(refrigerator door closes)

03:20.771 --> 03:22.873
YOU ARE VERY PREDICTABLE.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.204
IN WHAT WAY?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.836
IN... EVERY WAY?

03:25.836 --> 03:27.508
(laughing)
(laughing)

03:29.209 --> 03:30.841
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

03:30.841 --> 03:33.213
HONEY, WE JUST KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO REACT

03:33.213 --> 03:35.316
IN MOST SITUATIONS.
EVERY SITUATION.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.587
INEVERYSITUATION.

03:36.587 --> 03:39.420
I AM NOT PREDICTABLE.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.692
(all) I'M NOT.
I'M NOT. UGH.

03:41.692 --> 03:46.457
(all) I'M NOT. OOH!

03:46.457 --> 03:48.859
SO YOU'RE ONLY
GONNA BE MAD AT ME?

03:48.859 --> 03:50.931
I AM.
(both) YAY!

03:50.931 --> 03:53.534
ELLIE! STAN PUNCHED ROSA!

03:53.534 --> 03:55.436
(electronic
beeping and whirring)

03:55.436 --> 03:58.809
STANLEY TORRES, YOU ARE
GONNA CLEAN UP ALL OF THESE TOYS

03:58.809 --> 04:01.472
AND THEN GO WRITE ROSA
AN APOLOGY NOTE.

04:01.472 --> 04:02.543
DOUBT IT.
(beeps)

04:02.543 --> 04:05.876
OKAY, LET'S GO TAKE A NAP,
CHAMP.

04:05.876 --> 04:08.349
NO! NO! NO! NO!

04:08.349 --> 04:10.281
OH! SHARP TEETH THERE, PAL!
(grunts)
(mouths words)

04:10.281 --> 04:11.852
NO!
(grunts)

04:11.852 --> 04:13.354
NO!
OH, NO!

04:13.354 --> 04:15.686
THAT KID. (chuckles)

04:15.686 --> 04:17.358
FEISTY LITTLE FELLA,
ISN'T HE?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.829
NO.

04:18.829 --> 04:21.392
THAT BLACK EYE YOU HAD
LAST WEEK--

04:21.392 --> 04:23.263
THAT WAS FROM PLAYING TENNIS?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.895
SURE. SURE.
(imitates explosion)

04:24.895 --> 04:27.468
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUCH?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.401
JUST SAY IT!

04:30.401 --> 04:31.872
HE IS A DEVIL BABY.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.645
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

04:34.645 --> 04:36.647
HE LIKES TO SNEAK OUT
OF OUR HOUSE WITH A HAMMER

04:36.647 --> 04:39.750
AND SMASH THE NEIGHBOR'S
LANDSCAPING LIGHTS.

04:39.750 --> 04:43.013
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

04:43.013 --> 04:45.586
SWEETIE,
THIS SHOULD BE THE GANG.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.988
IT TOTALLY SHOULD.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.920
HEY, BUDDY BOY!

04:49.920 --> 04:51.291
DAD.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.623
(door closes)
TO WHAT DO I OWE

04:52.623 --> 04:55.566
THE UNANNOUNCED,
DIDN'T-CALL-AHEAD PLEASURE?

04:55.566 --> 04:58.829
I JUST CAME BY TO CHECK OUT
THE NEW COLLEGE DIGS.

04:58.829 --> 05:00.371
IT'S A 2-BEDROOM HOUSE,

05:00.371 --> 05:02.803
BUT, UH, THE RENT IS SUPER CHEAP
BECAUSE NINE GUYS LIVE HERE.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.805
I DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW
MOST OF THEIR NAMES.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.637
I THINK THERE'S A STEVE.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.409
YO, STEVE!

05:08.409 --> 05:10.310
(man) WHAT?!
(man) 'SUP, BRO?!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.843
HUH, TWO STEVES.
WHAT'S THAT?

05:12.843 --> 05:16.487
THATIS
OUR HOMEMADE GREEN SCREEN.

05:16.487 --> 05:17.718
NICE.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.850
YOU'RE OKAY BEING A NERD,
RIGHT?

05:19.850 --> 05:21.492
OH, YEAH. LOVE IT.

05:21.492 --> 05:23.494
HEY, I ALSO CAME BY 'CAUSE
I WANT TO DO YOU A FAVOR.

05:23.494 --> 05:25.826
NOW EVERY COLLEGE HOUSE
NEEDS A PET.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.858
OH. UH, DAD...

05:27.858 --> 05:30.060
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A BIG YARD.
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE AROUND.

05:30.060 --> 05:32.433
I MEAN, HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.
AND, BROTHER,

05:32.433 --> 05:35.766
THERE'S NO BETTER PANTY DROPPER
THAN A GIANT, CUDDLY HORSE DOG.

05:35.766 --> 05:38.338
YEAH, WE USE THE GREEN SCREEN
TO BRING IN THECHICAS.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.371
YEAH, I DON'T SEE THE LADIES

05:40.371 --> 05:42.843

05:42.843 --> 05:45.876

05:56.727 --> 05:58.459

07:04.525 --> 07:07.498
THIS IS SOON!

07:15.435 --> 07:16.667
THREE WATERS.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.569
(under breath) JERKS.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.671
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
IT'S THEM.

07:20.671 --> 07:22.042
AH-CHOO!

07:22.042 --> 07:23.113
WHOO!

07:23.113 --> 07:24.144
OH.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.646
(sniffles) OH, SORRY.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.978
I USED TO GET REALLY EMBARRASSED
WHEN I WOULD SNEEZE IN PUBLIC.

07:27.978 --> 07:31.051
NOW I JUST PUT A HAPPY NOISE
WITH IT, YOU KNOW, TO OWN IT.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.083
GOT THE IDEA
FROM MY NEW SHRINK.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.585
OH, HONEY.

07:34.585 --> 07:36.186
YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY
GONNA HAVE TO GO.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.229
(sneezes) OH.

07:39.229 --> 07:40.230
WHOO.
NO.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.192
JULES,
IF YOU GET MARRIED AGAIN,

07:42.192 --> 07:43.794
HOW DO YOU WANT
TO BE PROPOSED TO?

07:43.794 --> 07:45.165
TOM, I DON'T KNOW.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.167
YES, YOU DO.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.169
OKAY. I WANT IT TO LOOK
SOMETHING LIKE IT WAS

07:49.169 --> 07:51.872
OUT OF A FAIRY TALE, AND I WANT
EVERYONE I LOVE TO BE THERE.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.174
AND I WANNA DO ALL THE TALKING,
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE,

07:54.174 --> 07:56.476
I'M A STREET-RAPPIN' POET, YO.
(chuckles)

07:56.476 --> 07:59.179
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

07:59.179 --> 08:00.110
DOESHEWANNA KNOW?

08:00.110 --> 08:01.682
HUH? NO.

08:01.682 --> 08:05.085
WE SHOULD HANG OUT MORE
TOGETHER, JUST THE TWO OF US.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.158
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU
JUST BUILT A HOT TUB.

08:08.158 --> 08:10.921
I'M GONNA HAVE TO THROW
MY "TOO CREEPY" FLAG.

08:10.921 --> 08:12.923
I KNEW IT WHEN I SAID IT.
UGH.

08:12.923 --> 08:15.225
YOU KNOW, I USED TO THINK
THAT TOM WAS SECRETLY GAY.

08:15.225 --> 08:18.498
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU THINKALL
SINGLE MEN OVER THE AGE OF 35

08:18.498 --> 08:19.970
ARE SECRETLY GAY.

08:19.970 --> 08:22.032
WHEN WE MET,
I WAS OVER 35 AND SINGLE.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.274
DID YOU THINK...
(clenches teeth) I WAS GAY?

08:24.274 --> 08:26.136
(chuckles)

08:26.136 --> 08:27.808
HELLO.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.611
JULES, THEY'RE GETTING UP.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.212
CHECK FOR GUILT
IN THEIR EYES.

08:34.184 --> 08:36.286
I THINK I SAW GUILT.
DID YOU?

08:36.286 --> 08:39.219
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST GOT
MESMERIZED BY THEIR GREASY HAIR.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.021
I LOVE IT.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.624
RIGHT? OH, I WISH
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
(whispers) ME, TOO.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.130
THIS SHOULD BE THE GANG.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.201
WHAT?

08:51.201 --> 08:52.803
NOTHING.
AW.

08:52.803 --> 08:55.906
POOR OLD ANDY AND ELLIE--
MOSTLY ELLIE--

08:55.906 --> 08:59.269
AFRAID OF YOUR OWN SON. OH!

08:59.269 --> 09:00.771
(laughs)
SHH.

09:00.771 --> 09:02.873
(whispers) WE'RE--
WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF STAN.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.144
(whispers) NO.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.716
THEN WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

09:05.716 --> 09:07.247
IT'S SEXY.
IT'S SEXY.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.220
AW! LOOK AT THIS CUTE PICTURE
THAT STAN MADE.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.722
WHAT IS THAT?

09:11.722 --> 09:13.824
THAT'S A SUNFLOWER.
A LITTLE BUNNY RABBIT.

09:13.824 --> 09:14.925
IT'S A WHAT?

09:14.925 --> 09:17.828
IT'S A RABBIT--SUN--
RABBIT FLOWER.

09:17.828 --> 09:21.932
REALLY? IT LOOKS LIKE
A FLESH-EATING DEMON.

09:21.932 --> 09:23.994
I TOLD YOU.
STOP IT!

09:23.994 --> 09:25.836
WELL, IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T SCARED OF HIM,

09:25.836 --> 09:28.138
THEN YOU WON'T MIND IF I JUST--
IF I TAKE THIS OFF.

09:28.138 --> 09:29.870
NO.
NO. TAKE IT.

09:32.002 --> 09:35.245
(normal voice) IT JUST
NEEDS NEW TAPE.
(normal voice)
JUST A LITTLE TAPE.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.307
THE TAPE--SOMETIMES IT LOSES
ITS STICKINESS.
WE LOVE YOU.

09:37.307 --> 09:38.779
IT LOSES ITS STICKINESS,
STAN!

09:40.580 --> 09:43.954
SOMEONE IS GONNA GET HIT
WITH A HAMMER.

09:43.954 --> 09:48.318
I GOT SKATER BOY'S ADDRESS.

09:48.318 --> 09:51.361
GET READY
FOR OPERATION "REVENGEANCE."

09:51.361 --> 09:53.864
NOT A WORD.
OH, STOP BEING SO "PRECISIONAL."

09:53.864 --> 09:55.295
(hisses)

09:55.295 --> 09:57.027
WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING

09:57.027 --> 10:00.300
THAT GORGEOUS SKATER BOY
WILL NEVER EXPECT.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.004
WE ARE GOING TO T.P.HISHOUSE.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.305
ALL RIGHT!
WHOOP! WHOOP!

10:05.305 --> 10:07.107
I CALLED YOU PREDICTABLE,

10:07.107 --> 10:10.881
BUT JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA ZIG, YOU ZIG.

10:10.881 --> 10:12.883
YOU DID NOT SEE THIS COMING.

10:12.883 --> 10:15.245
REALLY? WHY DO YOU THINK
EVERYONE HERE WORE BLACK?

10:15.245 --> 10:16.787
EVERYONE, RAISE YOUR HANDS.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.048
(makes whooshing sound)

10:18.048 --> 10:20.150
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY OUT.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.793
SO YOU LOOKED IN THE MIRROR
AND THOUGHT THAT LOOKED GOOD?

10:22.793 --> 10:24.795
YEAH. (gasps)
(clatter)

10:26.657 --> 10:28.959
STAN?

10:28.959 --> 10:30.260
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.262
I'M GONNA KEEP TALKING
WHILE HE DRINKS WATER.

10:32.262 --> 10:34.334
BA, BA, BA, BA, BA,
BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA.
(laughs)

10:34.334 --> 10:36.366
BA, BA, BA, BA, BA.
(laughs)

10:36.366 --> 10:38.368
THIS IS SIG,
ONE OF MY ROOMMATES.

10:38.368 --> 10:40.040
HEY, SIG.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.372
THAT'S A PRE-SHOT
COMPUTER IMAGE. I'M OVER HERE.

10:42.372 --> 10:44.174
(ball clatters)
IT'S ALL VERY CONFUSING.

10:44.174 --> 10:47.878
DAD, I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST--
I DON'T NEED THE DOG.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.880
I WISH YOU WOULD'VE
SAID THAT RIGHT OFF,

10:49.880 --> 10:51.682
'CAUSE, TRAV,
THE THING ABOUT DOG TRAV

10:51.682 --> 10:53.754
IS THAT HE DECIDES
WHERE HE LIVES ON HIS OWN.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.326
AND ONCE HE'S FOUND A NICE SPOT
AND EATING A SHOE,

10:56.326 --> 10:58.188
HE'S HOME.

10:58.188 --> 11:00.230
SORRY, BUDDY.
NOTHIN' I CAN DO.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.392
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. HOLD ON.

11:02.392 --> 11:03.734
COME HERE. COME HERE, BOY.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.665
(door squeaks)
COME ON. COME ON, BOY.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.438
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE YOU MADE OF, CEMENT?

11:08.438 --> 11:10.370
(imitates Southern accent)
AND THEN SHE WAS LIKE,

11:10.370 --> 11:13.103
"STAY AWAY FROM MY MAN!"
POOM! POOM! POOM!

11:13.103 --> 11:14.304
YOU KNOW,

11:14.304 --> 11:17.307
HE IS A HANDFUL,
BUT HE'S GOT SPIRIT.

11:17.307 --> 11:19.249
THE SPIRIT OF THE DEVIL.

11:19.249 --> 11:22.112
I AM NOT GONNA SAY ANOTHER
DISPARAGING THING ABOUT STAN.

11:22.112 --> 11:23.413
I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH.

11:23.413 --> 11:24.985
I DO, TOO.
I KNOW.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.857
I JUST WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE,

11:26.857 --> 11:30.020
LIKE, HOW'S HE GONNA TURN OUT?
WHO IS HE GONNA BE LIKE?

11:30.020 --> 11:31.922
HEY, ELLIE.
LOOK, I MADE HIM

11:31.922 --> 11:34.464
A MATCHING ANKLE BRACELET
OUT OF ELECTRICAL TAPE.

11:34.464 --> 11:36.166
(singsongy)
SEPARATED AT BIRTH!

11:36.166 --> 11:37.367
WHAT, WHAT?

11:37.367 --> 11:38.468
WHAT, WHAT?

11:38.468 --> 11:40.170
WHAT, WHAT? (laughs)

11:40.170 --> 11:42.903
OH, PLEASE, NO.

11:45.475 --> 11:47.377
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE LESS MAD

11:47.377 --> 11:50.440
JUST BY GETTING NAKED,
RIGHT HERE.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.814
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT THE MOUTH GUARD.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.346
OH, YES.
ONCE THE MOUTH GUARD IS IN,

11:56.346 --> 11:58.718
THIS STORE IS CLOSED.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.420
ONE DAY, I WILL SLEEP WITH YOU

12:00.420 --> 12:03.423
AFTER YOU'VE PUT THAT VILE THING
IN YOUR MOUTH.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.355
IT'S MY EVEREST.

12:05.355 --> 12:07.457
NOW COME HERE.
UNH-UNH. STAY BACK.

12:07.457 --> 12:08.498
JUST COME--
I MEAN IT.

12:08.498 --> 12:10.730
A LITTLE BIT.
OH, IT'S GOING IN.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.403
LOOK, WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH
IF I THINK YOU'RE PREDICTABLE?

12:13.403 --> 12:15.936
BECAUSE, YOU DUMMY,

12:15.936 --> 12:18.438
IT'S LIKE...

12:18.438 --> 12:20.140
IT'S LIKE...

12:20.140 --> 12:22.873
YOU'RE SAYING THAT I'M...
BORING.

12:22.873 --> 12:26.446
BUT I LIKE BORING. THAT'S NOT
THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

12:26.446 --> 12:30.120
AND KNOW SHE GRABS HER ROBE
AND SLEEPS DOWN THE HALL.

12:30.120 --> 12:34.254
YOUTHINK YOU KNOW ME SO WELL,
DON'T YOU?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.526
I DO.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.959
(mouth full) THEN TURN OFF
THE LIGHTS, HANDSOME.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.991
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.762
OH, YEAH.
(laughs)

12:42.762 --> 12:44.895
HERE I COME, BABY.
OH. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME KISS.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.136
MMM.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.468
(groaning)

12:55.345 --> 12:56.546
(whimpers)

12:56.546 --> 12:58.048
(grunts)

12:59.850 --> 13:01.912
(whispers) TOM!

13:01.912 --> 13:02.983
DAD?

13:02.983 --> 13:04.554
NO.
OH.

13:04.554 --> 13:06.917
YOU WANT TO DO STUFF,
JUST THE TWO OF US?

13:06.917 --> 13:08.358
YEAH.
LET'S GO.

13:08.358 --> 13:10.360
COME ON. GET UP.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.562
YOU SLEEP NUDE!

13:12.562 --> 13:14.895
I'LL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

13:19.299 --> 13:24.004
IF NERD'S THE NEW COOL,
WHY ARE THEY ALL ASLEEP AT 9:15?

13:24.004 --> 13:27.537
WHO CARES?
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:27.537 --> 13:30.841
HEY, WHY ALL THE, UH, GAMES WITH
GETTING DOG TRAVIS OVER HERE?

13:30.841 --> 13:33.013
WHY NOT JUST ASK TRAVIS
TO TAKE HIM?

13:33.013 --> 13:36.987
I GUESS I CAN'T ASK TRAV 'CAUSE
I'M SCARED HE'S GONNA SAY NO.

13:36.987 --> 13:39.319
AND I'LL THINK IT'S BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN SUCH A CRAP FATHER

13:39.319 --> 13:41.852
FOR SO LONG THAT HE FEELS
HE DOESN'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

13:41.852 --> 13:45.195
HE'S NOT THE ONE KEEPING
STUPID THOUGHTS LIKE THAT ALIVE.

13:45.195 --> 13:46.826
YOU ARE.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.058
YEAH, MAYBE.

13:48.058 --> 13:50.060
IS IT WEIRD
THAT WE'RE DOING THIS

13:50.060 --> 13:51.461
AND WE CAN'T SEE OURSELVES
ON THE MONITOR?

13:51.461 --> 13:52.903
YES.

13:52.903 --> 13:54.504
OH! OH! DON'T LET GO!
OH!

13:54.504 --> 13:57.037
AAH! AAH! AAH!
OH! OH! COME BACK.
COME BACK. COME BACK.

13:58.168 --> 14:00.040
(sighs)

14:02.472 --> 14:04.174
OH.

14:04.174 --> 14:06.516
I GOT STAN INTO HIS CRIB.

14:06.516 --> 14:09.019
HE'S GONNA BE JUST LIKE YOU,
ISN'T HE?

14:09.019 --> 14:10.881
FINGERS CROSSED.

14:10.881 --> 14:13.583
HAVE YOUR MOMENT.
TELL ME WHAT TO EXPECT.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.456
OKAY. UM...

14:16.456 --> 14:18.428
WELL...

14:18.428 --> 14:23.393
IF STAN DOES GO DOWN...
MY PATH,

14:23.393 --> 14:27.567
IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THERE'LL BE
MORE... SCREAMING, CRYING,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.940
ANGER, BREAKING STUFF,
GETTING KICKED OUT OF PRESCHOOL,

14:29.940 --> 14:31.471
GETTING KICKED OUT
OF KINDERGARTEN,

14:31.471 --> 14:33.944
GETTING KICKED OUT EVERYWHERE,
CRASHING CARS, GETTING ARRESTED,

14:33.944 --> 14:35.505
PIERCINGS, DRINKING, AND SEX.

14:35.505 --> 14:36.546
(inhales deeply)

14:36.546 --> 14:37.908
WHEN HE'S 13--

14:37.908 --> 14:39.479
ENOUGH. IS THIS KARMA?

14:39.479 --> 14:44.414
I MEAN, I'LL ADMIT,
I'M NOT ALWAYS THE MOST...

14:44.414 --> 14:47.087
LOVELY PERSON...

14:47.087 --> 14:48.258
(laughing)

14:48.258 --> 14:50.360
ARE YOU LAUGHING?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.561
YES.

14:51.561 --> 14:53.093
FOR SHAME!

14:53.093 --> 14:54.464
RELAX.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.967
YOU KNOW THE MAIN DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ME AND STAN?

14:56.967 --> 14:58.929
I HAD...

14:58.929 --> 15:02.902
FIVE DIFFERENT
CRAPPY STEPFATHERS.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.937
STAN'S GOT
TWOAMAZINGPARENTS.

15:06.937 --> 15:09.379
WHAT? WHATEVER. HE DOES.

15:09.379 --> 15:11.341
(scoffs)

15:11.341 --> 15:14.014
LOOK, I THINK THAT

15:14.014 --> 15:17.087
IF YOU GUYS JUST STAY
IN THE GAME,

15:17.087 --> 15:19.019
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.951
THANKS.

15:20.951 --> 15:25.055
OF COURSE, SOME DEVIL BABIES
ARE JUST DEVIL BABIES.

15:25.055 --> 15:26.296
SORRY.

15:26.296 --> 15:27.327
HAD TO SAY IT.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.399
I GET THAT.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.663
JULES?

15:34.965 --> 15:36.466
WHATCHA DOIN'?

15:36.466 --> 15:38.638
YOU CAN'T COME.
UH, IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.240
PFFT!
GET IN.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.372
YAY!
YOU JUST LOST SHOTGUN.

15:42.372 --> 15:43.974
DAMN IT!

15:46.376 --> 15:49.379
(laughs)

15:49.379 --> 15:51.721
REVENGEANCE IS MINE!

15:51.721 --> 15:52.722
JUST GET THAT HEDGE
OVER THERE.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.254
I'LL GET IT.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.156
TOM SLEEPS NUDE.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.288
UGH. WHY WOULD
YOU TELL ME THAT?

15:58.288 --> 16:00.090
WELL, I WANT IT TO BE
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HEAD.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.962
HOW FUN IS THIS?!
SO FUN!

16:02.962 --> 16:03.994
(siren whoops)

16:03.994 --> 16:05.635
(gasps) IT'S THE FUZZ!
NO.

16:05.635 --> 16:06.997
SCATTER!
BYE!

16:06.997 --> 16:08.298
(laughs)

16:08.298 --> 16:10.040
(Jules speaks indistinctly)

16:10.040 --> 16:12.142
I WANT TO COME CLEAN.

16:12.142 --> 16:14.044
DOG TRAVIS
ISN'T A CHICK MAGNET.

16:14.044 --> 16:17.277
DAD, FOR ME, COLLEGE WILL
NEVER BE ABOUT GIRLS ANYWAY.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.648
SO...
(cans clatter)

16:18.648 --> 16:20.080
OHH.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.114
WELL, YOU'RE MY SON,
AND I LOVE YOU, NO MATTER WHAT.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.255
WASN'T COMING OUT TO YOU.

16:25.255 --> 16:28.118
JUST MEANT
THAT I'M HERE TO LEARN.

16:28.118 --> 16:29.319
NOT GAY.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.521
WELL, IF YOU WERE,
I MIGHT CRY FOR A MINUTE.

16:31.521 --> 16:33.523
NOT BECAUSE I'D BE UPSET
ABOUT IT, JUST BECAUSE I KNOW

16:33.523 --> 16:36.426
HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU
TO ADMIT IT TO ME...

16:36.426 --> 16:38.068
AND YOURSELF.

16:38.068 --> 16:40.330
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD HOW MUCH
THOUGHT YOU'VE PUT INTO IT.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.702
SORRY. YOUR MOM THINKS EVERYONE
SECRETLY SWINGS THAT WAY.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.534
YOU KNOW HOW SUSCEPTIBLE
MY BRAIN IS

16:44.534 --> 16:46.036
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS.

16:46.036 --> 16:48.038
I DO. BUT IT'S LATE.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.310
YOU'RE PROBABLY
GETTING REALLY TIRED.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.442
(yawns) YOU'RE RIGHT. I AM.

16:52.442 --> 16:54.614
ANYWAY, I NEED TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION

16:54.614 --> 16:57.047
THAT I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
ASKED YOU YESTERDAY.

16:57.047 --> 16:58.488
(yawns)

16:58.488 --> 17:00.790
WAIT. BOTH OF YOU
WET YOUR HAIR FIRST.

17:00.790 --> 17:03.223
(yawns) JUST GO WITH IT.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.155
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT TO ASK,

17:05.155 --> 17:08.058
BUT WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE
DOG TRAVIS?

17:08.058 --> 17:10.060
OF COURSE, DAD.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.261
REALLY?

17:11.261 --> 17:13.103
I MEAN, COME ON.

17:13.103 --> 17:16.166
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE
FOR ME?

17:16.166 --> 17:19.369
OH, COME HERE. I LOVE YOU.

17:19.369 --> 17:22.112
I'D PAY $12 TO SEE THAT.
(giggles)

17:22.112 --> 17:23.373
RIGHT?

17:23.373 --> 17:26.076
YEAH. OOH!
WE GOTTA GO PICK UP ELLIE!

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
(whispering) WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR THERAPIST

17:30.250 --> 17:31.551
IS GONNA THINK ABOUT THIS?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.553
(whispering) WHO KNOWS?
IT'S ONLY BEEN A COUPLE MONTHS.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.125
I'M STILL NOT
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH

17:35.125 --> 17:37.257
TO STOP LYING TO HIM
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.158
HE THINKS I'M 35.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.589
NO, HE DOESN'T.

17:39.589 --> 17:41.331
(dog barking in distance)
I'M NOT SURE,

17:41.331 --> 17:43.633
BUT I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT ME GETTING CAUGHT HERE

17:43.633 --> 17:46.566
WITH MY ANKLE MONITOR COULD BE
CONSIDERED A THIRD STRIKE.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.169
SO I'M GONNA BOLT.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.571
NO. NO. DON'T LEAVE ME.
PRISON'S GREAT!

17:51.571 --> 17:54.344
YOU CAN GET
THOSE NEAT TEARDROP TATTOOS.

17:54.344 --> 17:57.177
I-I'LL CREATE
A DIVERSION FOR YOU.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.180
TASER!

18:00.180 --> 18:01.681
(electricity crackles)

18:01.681 --> 18:04.083
AAH!

18:04.083 --> 18:06.156
(man) ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.162
(sneezes)

18:12.162 --> 18:13.663
WHOO!

18:13.663 --> 18:16.296
UH, ALL RIGHT, LOOK, OFFICER,

18:16.296 --> 18:18.568

18:20.300 --> 18:22.832
REALLY? I'M ALL EARS.

18:22.832 --> 18:24.274

18:24.274 --> 18:25.835

18:25.835 --> 18:27.477
HEY, JULES.
HI THERE.

18:27.477 --> 18:29.509
(imitates taser buzzing)
AAH!

18:29.509 --> 18:30.580
TASER.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.742
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:32.742 --> 18:36.146
THOSE KIDS DIDN'T SHARK
YOUR CAR. I DID.

18:36.146 --> 18:38.588
AND I EVEN HAD LAURIE
GIVE YOU THIS FAKE ADDRESS.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.220
WELL, THEN WHOSE HOUSE
IS THIS?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.252
IT'S EMPTY.
IT'S ACTUALLY YOUR LISTING.

18:42.252 --> 18:44.294
(click)

18:44.294 --> 18:47.757

18:47.757 --> 18:49.659
(click)
OH, YEAH.

18:49.659 --> 18:52.202
THE HOUSE SHOWS
REALLY WELL AT NIGHT.

18:52.202 --> 18:53.633
I KNEW YOU'D COME HERE
AND DO THIS.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.535
OH, SOTHAT'S

18:55.535 --> 18:57.807
HUH? YOU JUST WANTED ME
TO LOOK STUPID

18:57.807 --> 18:59.639
SO YOU COULD LAUGH
AT ME AGAIN?

18:59.639 --> 19:02.141
NO, JULES.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.646
I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT YOU
WANTED A LIFE FULL OF SURPRISES?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.147
AND LOOK.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.181
EVERYONE YOU LOVE'S HERE.

19:11.181 --> 19:13.323
AND ISN'T THIS ALL
KIND OF, UH,

19:13.323 --> 19:15.455
ISN'T THIS ALL
KIND OF LIKE A FAIRY TALE?

19:15.455 --> 19:20.530
в™Є WITH KISSES ON CHEEKS в™Є

19:20.530 --> 19:23.193
I MEAN, WHEN I SENT TOM
TO YOU IN THE BAR,

19:23.193 --> 19:25.195
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU TOLD HIM YOU WANTED?

19:25.195 --> 19:31.241
в™Є WE'RE LIFTED в™Є

19:31.241 --> 19:37.277
в™Є OVER THE EDGE в™Є

19:37.277 --> 19:39.309
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DO
ALL THE TALKING.

19:39.309 --> 19:40.680
в™Є I WILL FALL FOR YOU в™Є

19:40.680 --> 19:41.751
I'M SPEECHLESS.

19:41.751 --> 19:44.484
REALLY? YOU?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.416
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.220
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

19:50.220 --> 19:52.592
OKAY, I'M GONNA SAY YES,

19:52.592 --> 19:54.394
SO DON'T GET NERVOUS.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.428
I JUST, UM...

19:58.428 --> 20:00.730
I WANT TO THINK
OF A WAY TO SAY IT

20:00.730 --> 20:03.373
SO YOU KNOW HOW HAPPY
YOU MAKE ME.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.340
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

20:13.313 --> 20:19.319

20:34.264 --> 20:35.965
I'M NOT BORING, AM I?

20:35.965 --> 20:38.408
NO.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.340
YOU'RE A CRAZY PERSON.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.746

20:46.746 --> 20:48.348

NICE. MOUNTAINTOP.

21:05.995 --> 21:08.468
(taps key)

21:08.468 --> 21:10.570
OKAY, THIS IS
FOR OUR GRANDKIDS.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.901
SO WHEN YOU PROPOSE TO ME
THIS TIME,

21:11.901 --> 21:14.944
PLEASE, TRY TO SQUEEZE OUT
A TEAR. OKAY.

21:14.944 --> 21:16.446

21:18.978 --> 21:21.351
(dramatic voice)
MY DEAREST JULES.

21:21.351 --> 21:23.913
YES, MY LOVE!

21:23.913 --> 21:25.815
DUDE, HOW OFTEN IS
YOUR MOM GONNA COME OVER?

21:25.815 --> 21:28.718
PROBABLY MORE THAN I'D LIKE.
(groans)

21:28.718 --> 21:29.919
DAMN IT.
