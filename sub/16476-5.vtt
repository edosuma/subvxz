WEBVTT

00:04.580 --> 00:06.317
Let's go, let's go!

00:06.319 --> 00:07.968
We got two more bacon-wrapped scallops

00:07.978 --> 00:10.078
and one more pigs in a blanket.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.913
Hey, who's got the cilantro?

00:11.915 --> 00:13.615
Come on, faster, faster.

00:13.617 --> 00:15.250
Dessert's in 20 minutes.

00:15.252 --> 00:16.952
All right, you ready?

00:23.026 --> 00:24.726
Richard, Richard, Richard.

00:24.728 --> 00:26.914
Hey, that's a nice
monkey suit, Dominick.

00:26.924 --> 00:28.129
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:28.131 --> 00:29.631
Yeah, well, right back at you,
Richie Rich,

00:29.633 --> 00:31.113
only I don't think yours is a rental.

00:33.314 --> 00:35.236
Did your girl buy it
for you? 'Cause...

00:35.238 --> 00:37.205
- we both know you can't afford it.
- Hey, how about,

00:37.207 --> 00:38.573
“Thank you so much, Richie,

00:38.575 --> 00:39.908
for hooking me up with this gig.

00:39.910 --> 00:41.743
I really needed the cash.” Right?

00:41.745 --> 00:44.779
All right. Come on, behave yourself.
I'm gonna introduce you to Layla.

00:44.781 --> 00:46.781
You couldn't find an
easier way to make a statement?

00:46.783 --> 00:48.283
You really think that's what this is?

00:48.285 --> 00:51.277
That I'd choose my fiancé to make some
sort of statement? Daddy, please.

00:51.287 --> 00:53.435
I can't imagine you'd be with
somebody like him. He's a loser.

00:53.445 --> 00:55.266
That guy's the loser,
all right? Screw him.

00:55.276 --> 00:57.022
Yeah? That guy's my
future father-in-law.

00:57.032 --> 00:59.200
- We'll pick this up later.
- No...

00:59.210 --> 01:01.096
Mom, please...

01:02.138 --> 01:04.376
Layla, come on. Seriously?

01:04.387 --> 01:06.600
No, look, just relax,
he didn't mean it. He did mean it.

01:06.610 --> 01:09.049
- He called me a loser.
- I'm gonna talk to him some more.

01:09.059 --> 01:12.425
The lovebirds are really getting on.

01:13.315 --> 01:15.139
- Looks like it.
- Layla!

01:15.870 --> 01:17.045
Wait!

01:17.311 --> 01:18.684
Hey, wait!

01:19.319 --> 01:20.734
Layla!

01:20.839 --> 01:22.751
Layla, come back!

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.420 --> 02:03.024
All right, before you text him,
just let me do some digging.

02:03.026 --> 02:04.859
No, Cable, promise me you won't.

02:04.861 --> 02:06.428
Who are we talking about here?

02:06.430 --> 02:08.395
Remember that
deceptive advertising lawsuit?

02:08.398 --> 02:09.764
Our client's brother?

02:09.765 --> 02:11.232
Chunk's going on a date with him.

02:11.234 --> 02:12.367
The guy with the shoulders.

02:12.369 --> 02:14.002
I remember reading in
his profile that...

02:14.004 --> 02:15.403
No, please don't.

02:15.405 --> 02:18.106
I don't Google my dates,
I don't Facebook-stalk.

02:18.108 --> 02:21.743
I trust my gut, and let the relationship
develop, like a good novel.

02:21.745 --> 02:24.979
Chunk doesn't realize that our tools
from work can be used for play.

02:24.981 --> 02:27.215
I don't need recon for my dates.

02:27.217 --> 02:28.319
I know how to read people.

02:28.329 --> 02:30.399
Why waste time if there's
a deal breaker on day three?

02:30.409 --> 02:32.954
My ex Greg and I had open access.

02:32.956 --> 02:34.756
We allowed each other
to look at our phones.

02:34.758 --> 02:36.440
- No wonder you broke up.
- It was liberating.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.460
We already knew all the mundane stuff,

02:38.462 --> 02:40.895
so we could have really
in-depth conversations.

02:40.897 --> 02:42.731
That's eerily romantic.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.134
I need to find Dr. Bull.

02:46.136 --> 02:48.737
We just got a job offer.

02:50.073 --> 02:51.673
Newsfront correspondent, Jackson Norse,

02:51.675 --> 02:53.007
joins us now. Jackson?

02:53.009 --> 02:55.210
Daughter of billionaire Gavin Everton

02:55.212 --> 02:57.579
was found brutally murdered
outside a charity event.

02:57.581 --> 03:00.623
Police have arrested
her fiancé of two weeks,

03:00.633 --> 03:02.317
Richard Fleer.

03:05.522 --> 03:08.156
Richard was about to
sign a plea, 20 years.

03:08.158 --> 03:10.391
It wasn't enough for me,
but at least he was going away.

03:10.393 --> 03:14.062
I still can't believe she's gone.

03:14.064 --> 03:15.663
I'm sorry for your loss.

03:17.302 --> 03:19.234
It's unreal. This public defender

03:19.236 --> 03:20.769
came out of the woodwork last week,

03:20.771 --> 03:22.871
and somehow convinced
Richard to go to trial.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.272
Doesn't make any sense.

03:24.274 --> 03:25.306
He confessed.

03:25.308 --> 03:26.608
Gracias, Sheila.

03:26.610 --> 03:28.343
De nada, Señora Everton.

03:28.345 --> 03:29.708
We appreciate you asking us here

03:29.718 --> 03:32.080
to talk to you about how we
can help you with the trial.

03:32.082 --> 03:34.549
Though Gavin was only
a witness in the previous litigation

03:34.559 --> 03:35.750
Dr. Bull handled,

03:35.752 --> 03:37.152
Gavin said he never met anyone

03:37.154 --> 03:39.788
who understood juries
and trials the way you do.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.490
Well, it was just a case about
somebody reneging on a deal.

03:42.492 --> 03:43.925
We wouldn't have won
without you on our case.

03:43.927 --> 03:46.261
You see things other people don't see.

03:46.263 --> 03:48.496
How did Richard and Layla meet?

03:48.498 --> 03:51.199
They met at a restaurant
on the Upper East Side.

03:51.201 --> 03:54.068
A fancy place. He's a line cook,
works in the kitchen.

03:54.070 --> 03:56.437
Richard was peeling potatoes.

03:56.439 --> 03:58.776
Had she fallen for guys
like that before?

03:58.786 --> 04:01.591
Layla's always had a rebellious streak,

04:01.601 --> 04:02.777
but she would've grown out of it.

04:02.779 --> 04:04.412
They were engaged, weren't they?

04:04.414 --> 04:05.647
I don't know how he convinced her;

04:05.649 --> 04:06.915
they'd only known each other six months,

04:06.917 --> 04:08.683
and it was so clear
he was after her money.

04:10.086 --> 04:11.553
Excuse me.

04:11.555 --> 04:12.821
I got it.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.093
If you take this on for us,
this should cover the fee.

04:21.724 --> 04:25.667
And more. That's very
generous, Mr. Everton.

04:25.669 --> 04:27.669
Our daughter deserves justice.

04:27.671 --> 04:30.939
And if Richard and his attorney
try to cheat the system,

04:30.941 --> 04:33.374
you get that son of a bitch
locked up for life.

04:35.891 --> 04:37.512
This is Sam Perkins.

04:37.514 --> 04:39.247
District attorney's office.

04:39.249 --> 04:41.749
I'll be prosecuting the case.

04:41.751 --> 04:43.651
Dr. Jason Bull.

04:43.653 --> 04:45.854
I saw your clear rate with convictions;

04:45.856 --> 04:48.141
that's very impressive.

04:48.151 --> 04:49.457
That's my job.

04:49.459 --> 04:51.359
They ship 'em in, I ship 'em out.

04:51.361 --> 04:52.794
And this one's gonna go quick.

04:52.796 --> 04:54.662
Slam dunk?

04:54.664 --> 04:56.097
You can cash that check today.

04:56.099 --> 04:57.932
Well, since they went to
the trouble of writing a check,

04:57.934 --> 04:59.334
maybe I should take a minute or two

04:59.336 --> 05:02.604
and review the facts of
the case as you see them.

05:03.371 --> 05:07.308
Layla and Richard were seen
arguing at a charity gala.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.277
They'd been engaged less than two weeks.

05:09.279 --> 05:11.870
And based on eyewitnesses,
she was dumping him.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.848
And that's when Layla
ran out of the gala.

05:13.850 --> 05:14.983
Yeah, it got heated.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.606
Richard chased her out,
and an hour later,

05:17.616 --> 05:19.454
Layla's body was found
around the corner.

05:19.456 --> 05:20.722
Anyone see the murder?

05:20.724 --> 05:22.265
No.

05:22.275 --> 05:24.192
But we got all we need on him.

05:24.194 --> 05:26.669
So they picked up
Richard on a park bench,

05:26.679 --> 05:28.329
disoriented.

05:28.331 --> 05:30.732
And he had Layla's blood
on his shirt sleeves.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.300
The evidence

05:32.302 --> 05:33.751
is just gravy.

05:34.016 --> 05:35.521
When you have a confession.

05:35.531 --> 05:36.958
Where'd you find the rebar?

05:37.064 --> 05:39.607
There was a construction site nearby.

05:39.609 --> 05:41.976
That's what you used to hit Layla?

05:46.416 --> 05:47.382
Hey.

05:47.384 --> 05:49.366
It's okay, Richard.

05:49.736 --> 05:51.352
It's okay.

05:51.354 --> 05:53.221
You'll feel so much better
once you get it all out.

05:53.223 --> 05:54.455
Yeah, I killed her!

05:54.457 --> 05:55.890
Okay?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.670
I hit her on the head. She went down.

06:00.692 --> 06:02.997
It's all sort of a blur.
I don't know, I killed her.

06:04.935 --> 06:07.593
Like I said, ship 'em in, ship 'em out.

06:07.603 --> 06:10.538
Really? Time-stamp says 1:19.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.264
Police picked him up at 2:00 a.m.

06:12.274 --> 06:13.908
That's 11 hours in the box.

06:13.910 --> 06:15.476
Your detective didn't let up.

06:15.478 --> 06:17.839
Detective Murphy's a good cop.

06:19.249 --> 06:20.848
Still.

06:22.052 --> 06:24.085
Can I please just have some water?

06:24.087 --> 06:26.721
- Some water.
- Of course.

06:26.723 --> 06:28.456
Whatever you want.

06:30.687 --> 06:32.794
11 minutes or 11 hours...

06:32.796 --> 06:34.288
We got a confession.

06:34.298 --> 06:36.531
Guy's guilty.

06:39.992 --> 06:42.837
I want justice as much
as the Evertons, Mr. Perkins.

06:42.839 --> 06:44.706
As much as you do.

06:44.708 --> 06:48.309
Which is why I will take this case.

06:48.777 --> 06:50.203
His case.

06:50.213 --> 06:51.612
What?

06:53.259 --> 06:55.316
I'm hungry. You hungry?

06:55.318 --> 06:58.753
I could go for something extravagant,
like a wildebeest or a hippo.

06:58.755 --> 07:00.288
- Bull?
- What?

07:00.290 --> 07:01.956
We just gave up a huge payday.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.459
Not to mention, the suspect confessed.

07:04.461 --> 07:07.195
If you just murdered someone,
would you go sleep on a park bench?

07:07.205 --> 07:09.242
It's hard to say;
I've never murdered anyone.

07:09.252 --> 07:10.765
But don't push me.

07:10.767 --> 07:14.335
The first thing he asked for
after his confession was water.

07:14.717 --> 07:16.471
Makes me wonder how much
food and water he had

07:16.473 --> 07:18.562
during his 11 hours of interrogation.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.942
11 hours isn't that long.
When I was at Homeland Security,

07:20.944 --> 07:23.478
we had suspects who
took months to confess.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.313
Terrorists believe in a cause.

07:25.315 --> 07:28.549
Richard was a line cook
who just lost his fiancée.

07:28.551 --> 07:30.485
The facts line up too
easily against this kid.

07:30.487 --> 07:32.485
I know; most people hear
a man confess to murder,

07:32.495 --> 07:33.688
and they think “guilty.”

07:33.690 --> 07:35.757
You hear a man confess,
and you give up a fortune

07:35.759 --> 07:36.858
to represent him.

07:38.028 --> 07:40.431
- It's great to be me, isn't it?
- Wait, where are we going?

07:40.441 --> 07:42.063
- Jail.
- What?

07:45.168 --> 07:46.567
Dr. Bull.

07:46.845 --> 07:49.178
I was surprised you wanted
to meet with a confessed killer

07:49.188 --> 07:50.972
and a lowly public defender.

07:50.974 --> 07:52.640
I hear the Evertons
offered you a king's ransom

07:52.642 --> 07:54.042
to put Richard away.

07:54.044 --> 07:56.891
So I can't imagine why you'd
drag yourself down here.

07:56.901 --> 07:58.613
It's no time to be cynical, Isaac.

07:58.615 --> 08:01.149
You don't know it yet,
but you just won the lottery.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.051
Richard, how they treating you in here?

08:03.053 --> 08:04.439
Food okay?

08:05.663 --> 08:06.954
Yeah, it's fine.

08:09.461 --> 08:12.668
You used to cook Wagyu beef
with balsamic reduction,

08:12.678 --> 08:15.830
and now you're eating
rotten produce, fake cheese,

08:15.832 --> 08:17.899
and drinking purple sugar-water.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.472
But it's fine?

08:19.718 --> 08:21.506
Well, I guess we've learned

08:21.516 --> 08:23.638
one thing about you:

08:23.640 --> 08:25.840
you admit to things that aren't true.

08:25.842 --> 08:28.876
Yeah, you probably should've
just taken that money, then.

08:28.878 --> 08:30.812
Why? Because you're guilty?

08:32.513 --> 08:34.148
Layla...

08:34.150 --> 08:37.284
she came from money... Serious money.

08:38.455 --> 08:40.190
Your dad's unemployed.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.485
Brother did time for assault.

08:42.653 --> 08:45.193
What was Layla Everton
doing with a guy like you?

08:45.195 --> 08:48.650
We were in love. That's what
she was doing with me.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.018
Back off.

08:50.028 --> 08:53.049
- My client's been through enough.
- Agreed. Which is why

08:53.059 --> 08:56.709
this should be the end of his
nightmare and not the beginning.

08:59.488 --> 09:02.009
- Why did you confess?
- I don't know.

09:02.011 --> 09:04.879
My head was all messed up.

09:05.565 --> 09:06.862
It was like I was in a fog.

09:06.872 --> 09:08.716
All I could think about
was trying to get out of there

09:08.718 --> 09:10.414
as quick as I could.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.678
I kept asking them
what happened to Layla.

09:12.688 --> 09:14.572
All that cop would say was,

09:14.582 --> 09:17.432
“Well, you got to get that
guilt off your chest.”

09:17.442 --> 09:19.370
You feel guilty about something?

09:19.380 --> 09:21.596
Well, I'm the reason she was
out on that street alone.

09:21.598 --> 09:24.875
So, yeah. That was my fault.

09:25.756 --> 09:28.267
I should've been there for her,
but I did not kill Layla.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.470
I loved her.

09:30.196 --> 09:31.939
We are gonna show the jury

09:31.941 --> 09:33.508
that the police set up Richard

09:33.510 --> 09:35.076
because he was from the
wrong side of the tracks

09:35.078 --> 09:37.245
and the Evertons never wanted
him near their daughter.

09:37.247 --> 09:40.692
No, Isaac. If we make this
about rich versus poor, we lose.

09:40.702 --> 09:43.785
If we make it about money
or class, we lose.

09:44.053 --> 09:46.754
They're gonna make this
about Richard's confession.

09:46.756 --> 09:48.823
And that is what we're gonna destroy.

09:49.546 --> 09:51.859
It's your lucky day.
I'm gonna take this case.

10:07.794 --> 10:09.662
One more keystroke,
and all of the details

10:09.664 --> 10:11.397
of Chunk's date will be revealed.

10:11.399 --> 10:14.061
- Cable, I told you that I don't want...
- Yeah, yeah, you don't want to know,

10:14.071 --> 10:16.335
but we do. Hit it, Cable.

10:17.674 --> 10:19.251
Wow.

10:19.428 --> 10:21.931
- Boy.
- You're not gonna bait me.

10:21.941 --> 10:23.014
Wow.

10:23.024 --> 10:25.845
I don't need recon for my date!

10:25.847 --> 10:29.507
How many people think
Richard Fleer is guilty?

10:30.846 --> 10:31.978
Really?

10:31.988 --> 10:33.645
It's called job security.

10:33.655 --> 10:36.489
I don't believe
this is why I hired you.

10:36.491 --> 10:38.968
Can I see a show of hands?

10:40.403 --> 10:41.661
That's better.

10:41.928 --> 10:44.397
- Why?
- Simple... the evidence led to Richard,

10:44.399 --> 10:46.365
and he caved within a day. Half a day.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.601
But the research says
it's much more complicated.

10:48.603 --> 10:49.902
Even when they know they're innocent,

10:49.904 --> 10:51.704
60% of people will end up confessing

10:51.706 --> 10:54.140
when told there's overwhelming
evidence against them.

10:54.142 --> 10:55.274
60%?

10:55.276 --> 10:57.343
25% of convicts who are exonerated

10:57.345 --> 10:58.611
actually confessed.

10:58.613 --> 11:01.481
I just can't imagine confessing
to a murder I didn't commit.

11:01.483 --> 11:04.247
And that, my dear Cable,
is what we are up against.

11:04.257 --> 11:06.892
Everything else in this
case is circumstantial.

11:06.902 --> 11:09.655
But when it comes to false
confessions, it's tricky.

11:09.657 --> 11:11.795
People know they happen;
they just don't know how.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.993
If we focus solely on the confession,

11:13.995 --> 11:15.203
we're missing the bigger picture.

11:15.213 --> 11:17.918
- People know...
- Isaac, take a breath.

11:18.174 --> 11:21.186
Dr. Bull, I don't think you appreciate
the opportunity this case gives us.

11:21.196 --> 11:22.435
Yes, I do.

11:22.437 --> 11:24.237
And there's a time and a place for that.

11:24.239 --> 11:26.089
This is not the time.

11:26.099 --> 11:28.769
Our job is to get Richard
a not-guilty verdict.

11:28.779 --> 11:31.095
And our mock trial has told us that

11:31.105 --> 11:33.739
we get that by focusing
on the confession.

11:33.741 --> 11:35.941
How do we show the
confession was coerced?

11:35.943 --> 11:37.342
In voir dire.

11:37.344 --> 11:39.713
We need to find people who can
relate to being coerced.

11:39.723 --> 11:43.215
And then, Isaac, you and I are gonna
figure out what techniques were used

11:43.217 --> 11:45.724
to make Richard give
that false confession.

11:45.734 --> 11:48.095
Then all we have to do
is get the jury to understand

11:48.105 --> 11:50.619
that if they were in
the came circumstances,

11:50.629 --> 11:52.759
they might make a false confession.

11:52.769 --> 11:55.420
Chunk, Cable, prepare for
an 11-hour footage fest.

11:55.430 --> 11:58.092
Cull through every minute
of Richard's interrogation.

11:58.102 --> 11:59.351
I'll make the popcorn.

11:59.361 --> 12:01.525
No butter. Also, log
every technique used

12:01.535 --> 12:03.835
during the interrogation, would you?

12:04.374 --> 12:05.605
- Danny.
- Yeah?

12:05.607 --> 12:08.457
They never found the
rebar used to kill Layla.

12:09.201 --> 12:11.545
- I'll check the crime scene.
- Nice.

12:11.555 --> 12:13.986
Our culture is reaching
a breaking point, Dr. Bull.

12:13.996 --> 12:16.146
So am I, Isaac.

12:16.156 --> 12:19.733
Here's the thing. You know
what's better than being right?

12:19.735 --> 12:21.368
Being right and winning.

12:21.370 --> 12:24.405
So save your speech until you're
on those courthouse steps

12:24.407 --> 12:27.007
with your vindicated
client by your side.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.009
Okay?

12:29.011 --> 12:31.583
- Do you have a blue suit?
- No.

12:31.593 --> 12:32.825
Okay.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.783
Chunk, we got to get him a better suit.

12:35.785 --> 12:38.085
Detective Murphy, thanks for
running me through the crime scene.

12:38.087 --> 12:40.120
- You didn't have to.
- Yeah, I help out former cops,

12:40.122 --> 12:41.587
even if they were Feds.

12:41.597 --> 12:43.762
Besides, someone on the
force has to escort you.

12:43.772 --> 12:45.959
And it's fun for me to see you
come up empty-handed, you know?

12:45.969 --> 12:49.225
Usually, I only see the Feds when
they swoop in to muck up my case.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.645
Solve them on your own, and
you wouldn't need us to swoop in.

12:51.655 --> 12:55.202
- Okay.
- Is this where you found her body?

12:55.204 --> 12:57.673
Right by the garbage bin. Tragic.

13:01.368 --> 13:03.115
You guys think she was
murdered with rebar?

13:03.125 --> 13:04.712
Yeah. The head wound is consistent

13:04.714 --> 13:07.581
with the size and shape
of pieces of rebar we found

13:07.583 --> 13:09.420
by the construction site nearby.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.418
I don't see any wall splatter
from the rebar hits.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.225
Well, we think he brought the rebar down

13:13.235 --> 13:15.656
on her head in a vertical fashion.

13:15.658 --> 13:17.124
Far as we know.

13:17.134 --> 13:20.194
That's why there was
only blood on the Dumpster.

13:35.204 --> 13:37.411
Well, what do we have here?

13:37.413 --> 13:38.379
What?

13:38.381 --> 13:40.347
What, do you see something?

13:40.349 --> 13:42.850
Possibly. Here, give me a bag.

13:46.336 --> 13:48.318
What'd you find?

13:48.927 --> 13:50.477
What the hell is that?

13:50.487 --> 13:53.342
Could be something. Could be nothing.

13:53.352 --> 13:57.064
- I should probably take that in.
- Yeah, you should.

13:58.450 --> 14:01.182
_

14:08.053 --> 14:09.542
What's all that?

14:09.868 --> 14:12.326
Thought maybe you could make a snack.

14:15.249 --> 14:17.584
- Plastic knife?
- You are still in jail.

14:21.924 --> 14:23.590
That's the good stuff.

14:23.592 --> 14:26.293
So... are you trained classically?

14:27.098 --> 14:30.138
No. Growing up, our,
our big night out

14:30.148 --> 14:31.619
was the buffet at Sizzler.

14:31.629 --> 14:34.276
Well, from the
buffet to fine dining.

14:34.286 --> 14:36.837
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah, right.

14:36.839 --> 14:39.606
I was working at this place
called Pasco's for a few years.

14:39.608 --> 14:42.309
I started out as a junior chef, and,

14:42.319 --> 14:43.844
been climbing my way up, you know.

14:43.846 --> 14:45.612
That's where you met Layla.

14:45.614 --> 14:47.408
She...

14:47.418 --> 14:49.988
She came in one night on a bad date,

14:49.998 --> 14:51.385
and I was, I was on a break,

14:51.387 --> 14:53.620
and I saw this guy making moves at her.

14:53.622 --> 14:56.423
And it was pretty clear that
she wasn't into him, so I...

14:56.425 --> 14:57.891
I rescued her.

14:57.893 --> 15:00.060
She hung around until my shift was over,

15:00.062 --> 15:02.863
and, I made us a meal.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.642
And that was our first date.

15:05.652 --> 15:08.268
Little did you know, she was
a billionaire's daughter.

15:08.270 --> 15:09.903
She never made that a thing between us.

15:09.905 --> 15:12.039
Money didn't matter to Layla.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.875
Why else would she want to marry
a broke cook like me, right?

15:14.877 --> 15:16.983
Maybe 'cause she saw something in you.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.894
I don't know. I mean, she always
said she wanted to invest in me.

15:19.904 --> 15:22.116
Open up a restaurant together,
but I... I just didn't want

15:22.118 --> 15:24.615
our relationship to be about that.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.158
All right, hang on.

15:27.590 --> 15:28.692
There.

15:28.702 --> 15:32.360
Smoked salmon tartare
with an incarcerated dill sauce.

15:33.021 --> 15:35.224
All right, here we go.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.900
Very well done.

15:39.902 --> 15:41.335
Look at that smile.

15:41.337 --> 15:43.537
That's the Richard we
need to see in court.

15:43.539 --> 15:46.106
Confident, believes in himself.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.723
The jury's only seen you fall
apart in the confession video.

15:49.733 --> 15:52.050
I think it's time they see the real you.

15:54.318 --> 15:56.917
- Voilá!
- Um...

15:57.979 --> 15:58.952
I don't get it.

15:58.954 --> 16:00.788
- The screens all look the same.
- No, no.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.990
No, no. I just spent the last 36 hours

16:02.992 --> 16:06.617
installing the “TAC
Coercion Coefficient.”

16:06.627 --> 16:08.729
Well, maybe an explanation
in English would help.

16:08.731 --> 16:11.298
This is the key to Richard's freedom.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.802
We can now assess every juror's
susceptibility to coercion.

16:14.804 --> 16:18.705
It evaluates language patterns,
how often our jurors

16:18.707 --> 16:20.274
fall prey to Internet scams,

16:20.276 --> 16:22.342
their inability to hang up
on telemarketers.

16:22.344 --> 16:23.777
- I mean, the works.
- Wait.

16:23.779 --> 16:24.978
So the more gullible a juror is,

16:24.980 --> 16:26.680
the more likely they are
to relate to Richard?

16:26.682 --> 16:28.882
Not just gullible, but susceptible.

16:28.884 --> 16:31.084
Look, we need people who can understand

16:31.086 --> 16:32.686
how Richard could confess to a crime

16:32.688 --> 16:35.456
that he didn't even commit,
under the right circumstances.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.990
If the coefficient's
above eight, muy bueno.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.566
If it's below three, no muy bueno.

16:41.015 --> 16:42.294
Benny.

16:42.515 --> 16:44.865
These are voir dire questions.
Get them to Isaac.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.782
This will be fun.

16:49.599 --> 16:52.348
You may proceed with
the questions, Counselor.

16:52.358 --> 16:55.209
What if I were to tell you that
while we were sitting here in court,

16:55.211 --> 16:58.317
your car was being towed outside?

16:58.327 --> 16:59.692
Objection, Your Honor.

16:59.702 --> 17:01.515
He's antagonizing the jury pool.

17:01.517 --> 17:03.784
Is he serious? Did I get my car towed?

17:03.786 --> 17:05.786
Yes, Counselor, are you serious?

17:05.788 --> 17:07.119
It's a hypothetical.

17:07.122 --> 17:08.521
No one's car was towed.

17:10.559 --> 17:12.358
Rocco from Long Island.

17:12.361 --> 17:13.827
How low's his co-co?

17:13.829 --> 17:15.561
- His what?
- His co-co.

17:15.564 --> 17:17.285
Coercion coefficient.

17:17.295 --> 17:21.009
His ability to be forced
into undesirable situations.

17:21.019 --> 17:22.339
Like a false confession,

17:22.349 --> 17:23.859
and, or, you know,

17:23.869 --> 17:25.339
- marriage.
- Cute.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.772
I like it... co-co.

17:26.775 --> 17:30.244
His is 8.4. It's very good for us.

17:30.254 --> 17:32.346
Now, gathering from his Facebook posts,

17:32.348 --> 17:35.549
he complained when his company
went to 30-minute lunches,

17:35.551 --> 17:38.578
and he was demoted... twice.

17:38.588 --> 17:40.621
- Still works there.
- Demoted twice.

17:40.623 --> 17:43.070
Didn't leave. Lemming.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.525
Poor guy would walk off a bridge

17:44.535 --> 17:46.455
- if someone told him to.
- I'd walk off a bridge

17:46.723 --> 17:48.929
- for you, Bull.
- Yes, that's because

17:48.931 --> 17:50.664
I'd be under it, waiting to catch you.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.382
And you'd both die from the fall.

17:52.392 --> 17:53.600
Cable.

17:53.602 --> 17:55.536
What? I'm stating facts.

17:55.538 --> 17:57.404
- She's wrong; I'm very strong.
- Okay.

17:57.406 --> 17:58.772
Let me rephrase.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.020
Is it hypothetically possible

18:01.030 --> 18:03.413
you could have misread
the juror parking signs

18:03.423 --> 18:05.379
and have gotten your car towed?

18:05.381 --> 18:07.791
I thought I followed the directions.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.227
You sure?

18:11.184 --> 18:12.643
Maybe not.

18:12.653 --> 18:14.421
Caved in 30 seconds.

18:14.423 --> 18:16.467
Welcome to the jury, Rocco.

18:16.477 --> 18:18.935
Acceptable to the defense.

18:19.795 --> 18:22.412
Now, sir, excuse me.
Let me ask you one question.

18:22.422 --> 18:24.097
No. Now don't even try that.

18:24.099 --> 18:25.766
If you towed my car,

18:25.768 --> 18:27.935
you have until I walk out of this room

18:27.937 --> 18:30.237
- to bring it back.
- Arnold's a shift manager

18:30.239 --> 18:31.605
for a small retailer.

18:31.607 --> 18:33.307
Oversees eight employees.

18:33.309 --> 18:35.676
Co-co of 1.9.

18:36.845 --> 18:40.247
Immune to excuses,
even if they're explanations.

18:40.249 --> 18:43.417
This guy's never gonna see
Richard as anything but guilty.

18:43.419 --> 18:46.186
We move to strike this juror.

18:46.188 --> 18:47.521
Ma'am, I know

18:47.523 --> 18:50.791
we're told to avoid pyramid schemes...

18:51.994 --> 18:53.360
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:53.362 --> 18:56.359
Heard we got nine jurors who,
scored high on the co-co.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.331
That's encouraging.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.108
We still got three who
are almost impossible

18:59.118 --> 19:00.701
to convince Richard falsely confessed.

19:00.703 --> 19:02.603
How'd your crime-scene
tour with Murphy go?

19:02.605 --> 19:03.904
Well, I think I figured out

19:03.906 --> 19:06.673
why the cops didn't find
the murder weapon, because...

19:06.675 --> 19:08.141
that's the murder weapon.

19:08.143 --> 19:09.376
Garbage bin?

19:09.378 --> 19:11.545
I think the killer smashed
her head against it.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.617
See how her wound matches

19:16.627 --> 19:18.363
the bar on the garbage bin?

19:18.373 --> 19:20.120
Prosecution know about this?

19:20.122 --> 19:22.197
Well, I didn't want to tip my theory.

19:22.207 --> 19:24.125
And it doesn't necessarily
exonerate Richard.

19:24.135 --> 19:26.326
Well, it makes a better
story than the rebar.

19:26.328 --> 19:28.895
- Can we test it for DNA?
- Nope.

19:28.897 --> 19:30.623
It's rained since;
washed everything away.

19:30.633 --> 19:31.331
Bummer.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.599
What do you make of Murphy?

19:32.601 --> 19:35.771
I like the guy. I have a lot
of friends like him, you know?

19:35.781 --> 19:36.737
I mean, I get why he thinks

19:36.739 --> 19:38.605
that rebar was,
used as the murder weapon.

19:38.607 --> 19:40.474
There's a lot of leftover
construction material

19:40.476 --> 19:41.742
around the crime scene.

19:41.744 --> 19:43.644
Murphy thinks he got the right guy.

19:45.266 --> 19:46.791
I also found this...

19:46.801 --> 19:48.548
wedged in the garbage can... You see?

19:48.550 --> 19:49.983
- Is that glass?
- Yeah.

19:49.985 --> 19:51.360
I can see why the cops missed that.

19:51.370 --> 19:53.353
- I almost did.
- Well, let's show this photo

19:53.355 --> 19:55.055
- to a glass expert.
- That's where I'm headed.

19:55.057 --> 19:56.923
Always a step ahead.

19:56.925 --> 19:59.252
And let's find a non-damning
reason why Richard

19:59.262 --> 20:01.628
would have Layla's blood
on his shirt sleeve.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.365
Dr. Bull, we trusted you,

20:03.375 --> 20:05.866
and you decided to help the
killer. What about Layla?!

20:05.868 --> 20:08.182
Mrs. Everton, I know this is
difficult for both of you, but

20:08.192 --> 20:10.060
certain things are gonna
come to light during...

20:10.070 --> 20:11.584
Son of a bitch!

20:22.074 --> 20:23.633
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the E.R.?

20:23.643 --> 20:24.804
Your jaw could be broken.

20:24.814 --> 20:27.200
It's not broken. I've
been punched before.

20:27.210 --> 20:28.292
Girlfriends don't count.

20:28.302 --> 20:29.650
Speaking of girlfriends,
I think I figured out

20:29.652 --> 20:31.587
why Richard has Layla's
blood on his shirt.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.861
She was helping to clean up
a piece of broken glass.

20:33.871 --> 20:35.835
Look at that. See how
she's grabbing his arm?

20:35.845 --> 20:37.183
Well done.

20:37.544 --> 20:39.493
Now we can focus on
dismantling the confession.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.534
How is our jury looking?

20:41.544 --> 20:42.990
Well, after hearing opening arguments,

20:42.992 --> 20:46.227
we have two jurors suspicious
enough of police behavior

20:46.229 --> 20:47.928
that they're already inclined to believe

20:47.930 --> 20:50.030
that Richard was coerced
into confession.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.837
In a trial where I expected
to be at 12-zero,

20:51.847 --> 20:53.079
I'd say we have a head start.

20:53.081 --> 20:55.015
Seven others tested high on our co-co.

20:55.017 --> 20:56.850
Coercion coefficient?

20:57.322 --> 20:59.205
- It's cute.
- Thank you.

20:59.215 --> 21:01.588
But even though they tested
high, they are open to hearing

21:01.590 --> 21:03.056
both sides of the argument.

21:03.058 --> 21:07.127
They want proof that Detective
Murphy forced that confession.

21:07.129 --> 21:10.130
We have our work cut out for us,
but I'm confident we can sway them.

21:10.132 --> 21:11.664
The three I am worried about are...

21:11.666 --> 21:13.266
Lily, Wendy and Doug.

21:13.268 --> 21:15.235
They're the ones we have
to focus our language on.

21:15.237 --> 21:17.504
Doug played hockey for Boston College.

21:17.506 --> 21:20.507
He's performed well under pressure,
and has a hard time understanding

21:20.509 --> 21:21.975
how Richard could crack.

21:21.977 --> 21:26.669
Wendy, 42, programmer,
believes in systems and order.

21:26.679 --> 21:30.483
She was one of the bombs we weren't
able to defuse in voir dire.

21:30.485 --> 21:32.052
These are the hills we climb.

21:32.054 --> 21:35.455
I'm gonna go have a serious talk
with our own Clarence Darrow.

21:35.457 --> 21:39.426
Detective Murphy used
four psychological techniques

21:39.428 --> 21:41.294
to get Richard to make
a false confession.

21:41.296 --> 21:42.958
You're gonna use 'em on me?

21:42.968 --> 21:47.100
No. You are gonna make
Murphy acknowledge

21:47.102 --> 21:49.556
that he used each and every one of them

21:49.566 --> 21:50.816
in court.

21:51.372 --> 21:53.802
We know that at least nine
members of our jury have been

21:53.804 --> 21:57.176
tricked or coerced at some
point in their lives.

21:57.334 --> 21:59.280
And when they come to understand

21:59.290 --> 22:00.742
that Murphy used these techniques

22:00.744 --> 22:04.091
to get a false confession
out of Richard,

22:05.104 --> 22:06.949
they're gonna be on our side.

22:09.170 --> 22:11.784
Detective Murphy, let's talk
about the 11 hours you spent...

22:11.794 --> 22:13.488
The 11 hours you spent

22:13.490 --> 22:15.624
eliciting a confession from my client.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.559
For murder. Sure.

22:17.561 --> 22:19.928
How many times did Richard
tell you he was innocent?

22:19.930 --> 22:22.130
I couldn't tell you. What I do know

22:22.132 --> 22:24.433
is that he said he was guilty.

22:24.435 --> 22:25.834
Once.

22:25.836 --> 22:27.192
But before that,

22:27.202 --> 22:29.204
59 times

22:29.214 --> 22:32.007
Richard told you he did
not kill Layla Everton.

22:32.009 --> 22:34.067
- Does that sound about right?
- That sound about right?

22:34.077 --> 22:36.678
That's when you hit Murphy
with the first bullet point.

22:37.621 --> 22:40.816
- Mental exhaustion.
- Mental exhaustion!

22:40.818 --> 22:43.118
Wear your subject down, am I right?

22:43.120 --> 22:45.687
Guilty is guilty,
no matter when you say it.

22:47.246 --> 22:48.444
Then you move on

22:48.454 --> 22:51.927
to technique number two...
The promise of escape.

22:51.929 --> 22:54.062
Detective Murphy, once Richard

22:54.064 --> 22:56.234
was exhausted, uncomfortable,

22:56.244 --> 22:57.326
claustrophobic, did you...

22:57.336 --> 22:59.468
Tell him that the
only way he could escape

22:59.470 --> 23:01.236
was by admitting he killed Layla?

23:01.238 --> 23:03.071
You asking if I trapped him?

23:03.857 --> 23:05.152
I did not.

23:05.302 --> 23:08.643
I told him it would feel
better to tell the truth.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.546
I told you already I didn't kill Layla.

23:11.548 --> 23:13.646
Will you please just let me go home?

23:13.656 --> 23:15.150
Hey, listen, until you admit

23:15.152 --> 23:16.952
what you did to her,
you're not going anywhere.

23:16.954 --> 23:20.454
Well, it looks like we can
check off box number two.

23:21.637 --> 23:25.727
Then there's tactic number
three... offer a reward.

23:25.729 --> 23:28.663
Detective Murphy, isn't
that exactly what you did

23:28.665 --> 23:29.865
right here?

23:29.867 --> 23:31.233
So...

23:31.235 --> 23:33.769
Please. I'm really thirsty.

23:33.771 --> 23:35.637
Start talking about
what happened in that alley,

23:35.639 --> 23:37.806
and I'll get you a gallon
of water if you want.

23:37.808 --> 23:39.760
Will you look at that?

23:39.971 --> 23:41.443
Three out of four.

23:41.445 --> 23:43.215
One more for the clean sweep.

23:43.225 --> 23:47.939
Let's talk about your final
technique... forcing language.

23:47.949 --> 23:50.419
Did you feed Richard
the language that wound up

23:50.421 --> 23:52.967
- exactly...
- Precisely, verbatim

23:52.977 --> 23:54.883
in his confession?

23:55.729 --> 23:57.828
It doesn't matter
what I said to Richard.

23:57.838 --> 24:00.896
Okay? If you're innocent, you'll say so,

24:00.898 --> 24:03.832
- no matter what.
- Even after 11 hours?

24:03.834 --> 24:05.333
Go visit a prison.

24:05.335 --> 24:07.071
Every killer behind bars

24:07.081 --> 24:09.504
swears he didn't do it.

24:10.541 --> 24:13.310
Richard just found
out he lost his fiancée...

24:13.320 --> 24:14.861
I agree with the detective.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.846
I don't care how hard you push me.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.604
If I didn't do it, I'm never confessing.

24:19.614 --> 24:21.983
And you prodded
and you twisted his words,

24:21.985 --> 24:25.035
until he didn't think
there was any other way out.

24:25.444 --> 24:26.521
Did you ever consider

24:26.523 --> 24:30.358
that maybe you were pushing
an innocent man to confess

24:30.360 --> 24:32.254
to a crime he didn't commit?

24:33.003 --> 24:34.396
Never.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.869
I'm withholding judgment
until I hear from Richard.

24:40.871 --> 24:42.504
Something about him...

24:42.506 --> 24:44.072
He just looks guilty.

24:48.545 --> 24:50.726
Well, how can three people
still not be convinced?

24:50.736 --> 24:52.147
They want to hear from you.

24:52.149 --> 24:54.467
Well, if they want to hear
from me, then I want to do it.

24:54.477 --> 24:57.252
I'm concerned you're not ready.
You're too emotionally raw.

24:57.254 --> 24:58.820
Well, you can work with me.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.823
Chunk says you're the best
person alive at witness prep.

25:01.825 --> 25:03.792
Can show you what the
prosecution's gonna be like

25:03.794 --> 25:06.244
in court, but you're not gonna like it.

25:07.411 --> 25:08.697
Have a seat.

25:12.821 --> 25:16.004
So when Gavin Everton said to you

25:16.006 --> 25:18.573
you weren't good enough
for his daughter,

25:18.583 --> 25:20.108
it got you angry, didn't it?

25:20.110 --> 25:22.477
I don't care what Gavin Everton thinks.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.472
Yeah, you looked around.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.015
All of those rich girls

25:27.017 --> 25:30.489
and all her rich friends,
the way they look down at you,

25:30.499 --> 25:32.637
and thought that maybe
that's how Layla sees you.

25:32.647 --> 25:34.435
No. No, sir.

25:34.445 --> 25:37.125
Um... she loved me. We were engaged.

25:37.127 --> 25:38.560
For, what, like, two weeks?

25:38.562 --> 25:39.895
It was already falling apart.

25:39.897 --> 25:41.530
- Hey, come on.
- I think what happened

25:41.532 --> 25:43.298
is that what Gavin said got to you.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.933
And you knew that Gavin was right,

25:44.935 --> 25:46.902
because deep down, it struck a nerve.

25:46.904 --> 25:49.037
He was right. You don't belong

25:49.039 --> 25:51.039
with a girl like Layla,
not a guy like you.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.149
- You don't deserve her.
- It wasn't like that... It was not...

25:53.159 --> 25:54.976
So, when you followed
her into the alley...

25:54.978 --> 25:56.851
I didn't... I didn't
follow her into the alley...

25:56.861 --> 25:58.747
You said on the video you
followed her into the alley.

25:58.749 --> 26:00.187
Were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

26:00.197 --> 26:02.384
- I wasn't lying. I'm trying to...
- Come on! Tell me the truth!

26:02.386 --> 26:04.953
Just say it. Let's get
this charade over with.

26:04.955 --> 26:07.355
You followed her into the alley,
you didn't mean to do it,

26:07.357 --> 26:08.590
but that's what happened!

26:08.592 --> 26:10.792
Okay, what do you want me
to say? I killed her?!

26:10.794 --> 26:12.827
Okay, I dragged her body to the garbage

26:12.829 --> 26:15.063
like a piece of trash! Is that it?!

26:15.065 --> 26:16.503
Aah!

26:19.092 --> 26:20.602
Jury's gonna love that.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.873
That's what I mean by “emotionally raw.”

26:27.211 --> 26:28.777
Wait a minute.

26:28.984 --> 26:31.338
How do you know her body was dragged?

26:32.246 --> 26:34.049
I don't know.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.518
Well, we never talked about that.

26:36.824 --> 26:38.963
It was never mentioned in court.

26:39.227 --> 26:42.377
Murphy must have told me.
Look, what does it matter?

26:46.544 --> 26:49.397
Taking apart Murphy on the
stand gained us two jurors,

26:49.399 --> 26:52.801
but we still have five undecided
and three locked against us.

26:52.803 --> 26:55.537
During the interrogation,
Detective Murphy told Richard

26:55.539 --> 26:57.439
that Layla's body had been dragged.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.573
Okay.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.075
Well, that information wasn't available

27:00.077 --> 27:02.811
until two days after his confession,

27:02.813 --> 27:05.347
because it was only
in the M.E.'s report.

27:05.349 --> 27:08.216
If the information wasn't
available until two days later,

27:08.218 --> 27:10.252
how did Murphy know she was dragged?

27:10.254 --> 27:11.875
Somebody must have told him.

27:11.885 --> 27:15.031
So, either Murphy is hiding a witness...

27:15.041 --> 27:17.792
Or he's protecting
Layla's actual killer.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.407
We have shown the jury

27:32.417 --> 27:34.253
what Detective Murphy did

27:34.255 --> 27:37.356
to get a confession, and
they still find him credible,

27:37.358 --> 27:39.258
which is incredible,
so what do you think?

27:39.260 --> 27:42.107
Is Murphy protecting someone with
intimate knowledge of the murder?

27:42.117 --> 27:44.841
No. I don't think he's knowingly
protecting the killer.

27:44.851 --> 27:46.818
My guess is he has a criminal informant

27:46.820 --> 27:48.352
whose identity he wants
to keep under wraps.

27:48.354 --> 27:51.255
Every witness should have been
logged in his police report, even Cls.

27:51.257 --> 27:55.096
That's interesting. If we can
prove that he deliberately omitted

27:55.106 --> 27:59.797
a criminal informant and key
witness in his report, well,

27:59.799 --> 28:02.467
ruins his credibility, and it'll
swing the rest of the jury.

28:02.469 --> 28:04.022
You want to put Murphy
back on the stand.

28:04.032 --> 28:05.599
You really think that
would swing the jury?

28:05.609 --> 28:07.458
Last time I had him up
on the witness stand,

28:07.468 --> 28:10.002
I took him apart piece by piece.
It only won us two jurors.

28:10.004 --> 28:11.504
Now we can attack his credibility,

28:11.506 --> 28:13.304
not just his technique.

28:13.314 --> 28:15.487
You can take him, Isaac.
I can walk you through it.

28:15.497 --> 28:18.277
It's just, I've been up against
cops like this. They're Teflon.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.249
The jury wants to believe them.

28:20.259 --> 28:22.281
Danny, put up Lily's info.

28:24.142 --> 28:27.286
Her boyfriend lost his job,
they had a massive fight, and

28:27.288 --> 28:29.434
she just filed a restraining
order this morning.

28:29.444 --> 28:31.624
So, talking about
Richard's money problems

28:31.626 --> 28:34.694
- is not gonna move her.
- But Murphy's misconduct will.

28:36.413 --> 28:38.731
It's time to come clean, Richard.

28:39.188 --> 28:40.666
I didn't kill Layla.

28:40.668 --> 28:43.135
You dragged her dead body next to

28:43.137 --> 28:45.604
the garbage bin, you left her
there like a piece of trash.

28:45.606 --> 28:46.806
No, I didn't.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.075
Now, would you mind telling
the court why you said that?

28:49.077 --> 28:50.476
“Dragged like trash”?

28:50.478 --> 28:51.868
I said it because it happened.

28:51.878 --> 28:54.113
That's from hour nine
of your interrogation

28:54.115 --> 28:56.582
out of 11 excruciating hours.

28:56.584 --> 28:58.851
You consider yourself
a solid detective, don't you?

28:58.853 --> 29:00.753
- More than solid.
- I agree.

29:00.755 --> 29:02.688
You take very detailed notes.

29:02.690 --> 29:05.414
But nowhere in your
notes did you mention

29:05.424 --> 29:07.827
that Layla's body was dragged.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.880
Actually, it's first mentioned

29:09.890 --> 29:12.231
in the medical examiner's report,

29:12.233 --> 29:14.266
which I have here.

29:14.830 --> 29:17.770
Would you mind reading the date
at that top of that report?

29:17.772 --> 29:19.171
October 25th.

29:19.173 --> 29:22.174
Now that's two days after

29:22.176 --> 29:23.642
Richard's confession.

29:23.644 --> 29:25.277
Am I right?

29:26.114 --> 29:28.514
You know, math was never my strong suit.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.550
You'll have to forgive me. I'm,

29:31.552 --> 29:33.634
trying to sort all this out.

29:33.644 --> 29:36.355
If you didn't know that
Layla's body was dragged until

29:36.357 --> 29:39.904
two days after Richard's confession,

29:39.914 --> 29:42.881
why did you say that on the video?

29:43.533 --> 29:46.298
I can't reveal my source.
It's a confidential informant.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.188
So, there's an eyewitness
to Layla Everton's murder,

29:49.198 --> 29:52.271
whose account you used
to elicit a confession

29:52.273 --> 29:55.875
from Richard Fleer, and you
failed to note it in your report?

29:55.877 --> 29:57.629
That's correct.

29:57.639 --> 30:00.012
Now, I know that, police are allowed

30:00.014 --> 30:01.881
to lie to suspects

30:01.883 --> 30:03.946
to illicit a confession,

30:04.245 --> 30:06.919
but is this standard to
omit this information?

30:06.921 --> 30:08.687
I didn't really think about it.

30:08.689 --> 30:10.356
Considering someone might

30:10.358 --> 30:12.091
go to prison for life,

30:12.093 --> 30:15.019
and how thorough you are
in every other aspect,

30:15.029 --> 30:16.650
can you explain

30:16.660 --> 30:18.541
why such a critical detail

30:18.551 --> 30:21.400
didn't deserve even a second's thought?

30:23.471 --> 30:24.681
Yeah.

30:24.691 --> 30:28.477
Because as an officer,
I have to protect my informants.

30:28.487 --> 30:30.142
And I stand by him

30:30.788 --> 30:32.278
and the murder confession

30:32.280 --> 30:34.035
that resulted from this.

30:41.091 --> 30:42.488
Five yellows

30:42.490 --> 30:45.024
swinging green.

30:45.026 --> 30:47.374
We're making progress,
but there's still more to do.

30:47.384 --> 30:49.161
No movement on our three reds.

30:49.163 --> 30:51.197
Those three reds scored
low on the co-co.

30:51.199 --> 30:53.232
Which is no bueno.

30:53.234 --> 30:55.422
Hey, Chunk, can I borrow
you for a second?

30:55.432 --> 30:57.303
- Yeah.
- Any idea what this is?

30:57.305 --> 30:59.004
I ran it past a forensic glass analyst,

30:59.006 --> 31:00.639
and there's not enough there to I.D.,

31:00.641 --> 31:03.879
but he said that part
right there could be a bevel.

31:03.889 --> 31:06.412
A bevel? Let me see.

31:06.414 --> 31:08.347
If I had to guess,
I'd say it's a cuff link.

31:08.349 --> 31:11.250
I had to order a bunch of those for
a photo shoot a few years back.

31:11.252 --> 31:12.651
The whole box came broken.

31:12.653 --> 31:15.287
Cheap cuff links at a
$2,000-a-plate charity ball?

31:15.289 --> 31:18.124
I'd start with the service staff.

31:18.746 --> 31:19.825
Thank you.

31:21.066 --> 31:25.176
So, how do we convince our three
red jurors that Richard's innocent?

31:25.186 --> 31:26.732
Well, we make 'em fully understand

31:26.734 --> 31:28.746
what Detective Murphy
put Richard through.

31:28.756 --> 31:31.891
You mean we arrest and interrogate
the holdouts until they break?

31:31.901 --> 31:33.072
Well, we don't have to arrest 'em.

31:33.074 --> 31:35.040
You're in the right neighborhood though.

31:35.042 --> 31:37.992
We just have to get 'em
to crack under pressure.

31:38.238 --> 31:40.086
Look at that.

31:40.412 --> 31:42.915
- That's a good fortune.
- Is that...

31:47.667 --> 31:50.867
We better hurry; the trial
starts back up again soon.

31:59.843 --> 32:01.934
Ooh. Going up?

32:03.025 --> 32:05.137
Sorry.

32:06.944 --> 32:08.482
- Aren't you, um...?
- With the defense,

32:08.492 --> 32:11.799
so we can't discuss the case,
yes. Or the Giants.

32:11.809 --> 32:13.248
Why not the Giants?

32:13.258 --> 32:16.348
Well, we wouldn't want
to jinx them, would we?

32:22.456 --> 32:24.690
No good. We're stuck.

32:25.781 --> 32:26.959
Jinx.

32:26.961 --> 32:28.160
Stuck?

32:28.162 --> 32:29.228
No way.

32:29.230 --> 32:30.729
We can't be stuck.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.131
I don't like tight spaces.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.333
- Just breathe.
- What do we do?

32:34.335 --> 32:35.868
Push the red button.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.803
Pull it.

32:37.805 --> 32:39.524
That's the good sound.

32:39.534 --> 32:41.036
Security.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.001
What's your emergency?

32:43.011 --> 32:45.502
We got six people stuck in an
elevator at the courthouse.

32:45.512 --> 32:47.646
You got to send somebody
to get us out right away.

32:47.648 --> 32:49.415
Stand by, ma'am.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.469
The hell do you mean, “stand by”?

33:00.147 --> 33:02.975
- There's no ventilation.
- Okay, let's just remain calm.

33:02.985 --> 33:06.119
- Excuse me, are you on our way?
- We contacted maintenance.

33:06.121 --> 33:08.722
And unfortunately, they're
dealing with an unusual number

33:08.724 --> 33:10.479
of service calls today.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.325
You're going to have to sit tight.

33:12.327 --> 33:13.693
How long?

33:15.473 --> 33:17.304
No longer than a few hours.

33:17.314 --> 33:18.732
A few hours?

33:18.734 --> 33:20.712
We're jurors in a trial.

33:20.924 --> 33:22.662
Stand by, please.

33:22.935 --> 33:26.060
Well, what do we do if somebody
has to go to the bathroom?

33:26.070 --> 33:27.999
We'll be fine.

33:30.554 --> 33:31.753
Do it.

33:32.047 --> 33:33.764
Just give 'em a little taste.

33:34.249 --> 33:36.650
We should get out of here.

33:36.652 --> 33:38.985
I bet a medical emergency
gets a response.

33:38.987 --> 33:42.029
No, we could get in
trouble for that, right?

33:42.039 --> 33:44.647
- Yes.
- This feels like a medical emergency.

33:44.657 --> 33:46.005
Yeah.

33:50.365 --> 33:51.564
Having a heart attack!

33:51.566 --> 33:53.486
Let's call them back and
tell them that, okay?

33:55.211 --> 33:56.195
Cable!

33:56.205 --> 33:58.071
I told you not to trust
me with all this power.

33:58.073 --> 34:01.614
It's just a little brake release.
They'll be fine. Relax.

34:01.624 --> 34:02.997
Lying to get out of here?!

34:03.007 --> 34:05.245
- I'm okay with it!
- So am I! So am I. Yeah.

34:05.247 --> 34:06.546
Hi,

34:06.548 --> 34:08.214
it's the elevator people again.

34:08.216 --> 34:09.783
We have someone in here going into...

34:09.784 --> 34:12.217
cardiac arrest. We need help right now.

34:12.219 --> 34:13.818
It's a medical emergency.

34:13.828 --> 34:15.922
We can send the fire
department, but first,

34:15.924 --> 34:18.685
can you please describe the symptoms?

34:18.695 --> 34:21.123
Chest pains, um, red in the face,

34:21.132 --> 34:23.929
trouble breathing!
I'm pretty sure it's a coronary.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.364
That's it.

34:25.783 --> 34:27.377
That's what we're looking for.

34:27.387 --> 34:28.868
We got 'em.

34:32.741 --> 34:35.525
Luckily, the power is back up.
I contacted the fire department

34:35.534 --> 34:37.344
and they're sending EMTs right away.

34:37.346 --> 34:40.456
- Never mind. False alarm.
- That was not fun.

34:40.466 --> 34:42.081
The jinx is lifted though.

34:42.083 --> 34:43.983
Giants are going all the way.

34:48.456 --> 34:51.054
take the stairs.

34:51.065 --> 34:52.554
That took all of ten minutes.

34:52.563 --> 34:54.306
Imagine if you were
in there for 11 hours.

34:54.317 --> 34:56.395
Who authorized the extra drops?

34:56.405 --> 34:59.244
Tell Cable she has
dish duty all next week.

34:59.254 --> 35:01.310
Moment of truth.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.933
- Good luck.
- Okay.

35:02.943 --> 35:06.336
I made a few adjustments
to your closing.

35:06.346 --> 35:07.830
I-I don't understand.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.018
That's a winning speech.

35:10.028 --> 35:12.142
You just got to trust me.

35:16.431 --> 35:18.451
You can believe the witnesses,

35:18.881 --> 35:20.785
and you can believe the evidence.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.967
But most of all, you can believe

35:22.977 --> 35:25.928
in the words right out of
the mouth of the defendant,

35:25.938 --> 35:30.597
when he said, “Yes,
I killed Layla Everton.”

35:30.599 --> 35:33.769
People lie all the time. It's true.

35:33.779 --> 35:37.400
But they lie to get out of jail,
not to get into jail.

35:37.550 --> 35:40.625
When you say you did it, you did it.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.961
This is the definition
of an open-and-shut case.

35:49.795 --> 35:51.319
Yes, it's true.

35:52.053 --> 35:53.596
Richard confessed.

35:54.178 --> 35:55.402
Once.

35:56.442 --> 35:58.404
But he professed his innocence

35:58.414 --> 36:00.794
59 times.

36:01.696 --> 36:03.335
If Richard had money,

36:03.345 --> 36:06.065
a lawyer would've been next to
him in that interrogation room.

36:06.067 --> 36:09.235
Richard would've been out
in minutes, not hours.

36:09.591 --> 36:11.337
If Richard had money,

36:11.653 --> 36:14.854
he never would've been
forced into a confession.

36:15.453 --> 36:18.344
But Richard doesn't have money,

36:18.346 --> 36:20.010
so he gets me.

36:21.740 --> 36:24.114
Every once in a while, someone like me

36:24.124 --> 36:26.619
gets to help an innocent man.

36:28.575 --> 36:33.293
Detective Murphy forced
Richard to confess.

36:33.706 --> 36:35.937
And without that confession,

36:35.947 --> 36:38.273
all you have is reasonable doubt.

36:39.145 --> 36:42.769
How long would you last
in that interrogation room?

36:43.428 --> 36:45.672
Under the right circumstances...

36:46.201 --> 36:48.808
Awful, frightening,

36:49.530 --> 36:52.612
claustrophobic circumstances...

36:53.121 --> 36:54.834
Don't you think even you could panic

36:54.844 --> 36:57.958
and convince yourself to say
something that wasn't true

36:57.968 --> 37:01.187
if you thought it might help you escape?

37:10.546 --> 37:13.732
- How you feeling?
- I'm not sure.

37:13.742 --> 37:15.268
A little freaked out.

37:18.686 --> 37:21.079
I don't know how to thank you.

37:21.089 --> 37:24.544
Well, don't thank me yet.

37:27.054 --> 37:29.394
You know, when I was with Layla,

37:29.878 --> 37:32.552
it always felt like
anything was possible.

37:34.996 --> 37:38.196
She's the only person
who ever really believed in me.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.528
And, now that she's gone...

37:41.530 --> 37:45.130
Listen, Richard, whatever decision
that jury comes back with,

37:45.542 --> 37:48.042
just remember that feeling she gave you.

37:48.603 --> 37:52.505
Because what Layla saw in
you is still there.

37:54.209 --> 37:58.359
And I'll be the first one to book a
table when you open your restaurant.

37:59.261 --> 38:02.124
Why the hell'd you turn down
all that money for me?

38:02.134 --> 38:06.419
There was a time when,
I did cases for money.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.756
And I never want to
have to do that again.

38:14.729 --> 38:16.429
The jury's back.

38:18.294 --> 38:19.713
All right.

38:21.296 --> 38:22.936
Here we go.

38:33.068 --> 38:35.718
Would the foreman read the verdict?

38:38.096 --> 38:40.025
On the charge of murder

38:40.413 --> 38:42.522
in the first degree,

38:42.524 --> 38:44.324
what say you?

38:44.740 --> 38:46.400
We find the defendant,

38:47.105 --> 38:48.895
Richard Fleer...

38:51.434 --> 38:52.825
not guilty.

38:55.348 --> 38:58.281
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, thank you for your service

38:58.291 --> 39:01.633
and for being an integral part
of the judicial system.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.113
- Thank you.
- You are dismissed.

39:08.784 --> 39:11.351
I think now I can thank you.

39:12.829 --> 39:14.398
Time to open a restaurant.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.699
All right.

39:22.308 --> 39:24.341
There may be reasonable doubt, Dr. Bull,

39:24.343 --> 39:26.143
but I'm not convinced.

39:26.145 --> 39:28.745
I told you I'd get justice for Layla.

39:28.747 --> 39:30.372
What do you mean?

39:30.742 --> 39:32.449
One of my team

39:32.451 --> 39:35.285
just got a lead on the real killer.

39:43.291 --> 39:45.963
Okay, I'm meeting Nick tomorrow,
and this is driving me mad.

39:45.965 --> 39:47.564
So ruin the end of the movie.

39:47.566 --> 39:50.767
Read the last page of
the novel and spill it.

39:51.351 --> 39:53.537
How 'bout I just show you?

39:59.178 --> 40:00.611
Wow.

40:00.613 --> 40:02.729
So he's into the Renaissance fair.

40:02.739 --> 40:04.887
This is why you should let me tell you.

40:04.897 --> 40:06.950
No. I never should've
let you in my head.

40:06.952 --> 40:09.148
I prefer to be surprised.

40:09.158 --> 40:10.954
And now when he tells me,
I've got to fake it.

40:10.956 --> 40:13.156
how do you organically bring it

40:13.158 --> 40:15.102
into the conversation?

40:15.112 --> 40:17.527
I've picked up a few
interrogation techniques.

40:17.529 --> 40:18.862
At the library.

40:20.399 --> 40:21.965
Stop. Just stop.

40:24.068 --> 40:25.969
You want me to talk
to your mother again?

40:25.971 --> 40:28.939
No. This is Detective
Murphy's redemption.

40:28.941 --> 40:30.674
Remember that piece of glass I found?

40:30.676 --> 40:32.250
It's from a $12 cuff link.

40:32.260 --> 40:33.777
So I ran a background
on the service staff

40:33.779 --> 40:35.679
and came across a friend of Richard's

40:35.681 --> 40:38.782
who had a sexual assault
conviction wiped off his record.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.788
Guy's name is Dominick.

40:40.798 --> 40:42.516
The cuff link proves he was the killer.

40:42.526 --> 40:45.489
He originally told Murphy
that he saw Richard kill Layla.

40:45.491 --> 40:47.145
But when we interrogated him

40:47.155 --> 40:49.059
an hour ago, Dominick confessed.

40:50.129 --> 40:52.562
So Murphy didn't know
his C.I. was the killer.

40:52.564 --> 40:55.732
- He trusted him.
- Disturbing.

Wow.

40:57.036 --> 40:59.036
You're just full of
surprises. What's this?

40:59.038 --> 41:01.738
That is from the Evertons.
They were at the police station

41:01.740 --> 41:05.876
when Dominick gave his confession.
They wanted you to have that.

41:05.878 --> 41:09.246
Said it was a thank you
for keeping your word.

41:13.317 --> 41:15.085
That's our full fee.

41:17.894 --> 41:19.160
Salud.
