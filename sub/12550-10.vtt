WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.441
MARIA: That shooting star
could be a space rock

00:08.508 --> 00:10.810
burning up as it falls through
our atmosphere,

00:10.877 --> 00:14.147
or could be a ship
that's travelled
a billion light years.

00:14.214 --> 00:18.151
They might be friendly
and they might not,
like the Slitheen.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.886
They wanted to drain
our Sun's energy

00:19.953 --> 00:21.855
and leave the Earth
a dead ball of ice.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.358
But we stopped them,

00:25.425 --> 00:28.728
(CHUCKLES) Sarah Jane, Luke,
Clyde, and me.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.731
See, I remember the black out,
but the papers said
it was a temporary reversal

00:31.798 --> 00:33.800
of the Earth's magnetic
something or other.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.002
That's what Mr Smith
put into the news releases.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.404
Sarah Jane's computer.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.507
And which branch of PC World
did that come from?

00:42.108 --> 00:43.309
He's alien,

00:43.376 --> 00:45.278
I don't know where from.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.147
Not sure
if Sarah Jane knows.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.916
Right. (SIGHS)

00:49.983 --> 00:53.553
Anyway, so Clyde realised
we could use vinegar as
a weapon against the Slitheen.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.688
CLYDE: You heard her!

00:55.755 --> 00:56.689
MARIA: <i>Most of them escaped,</i>
<i>teleported back</i>
<i>to the mothership.</i>

00:58.625 --> 00:59.926
Maria, you're 14.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.429
Dad, the world
would have died.

01:02.495 --> 01:05.632
I'm your father.
You never thought I should
know about any of this?

01:07.434 --> 01:08.868
It was difficult.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.603
Especially after you
got turned to stone.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.671
I beg your pardon?

01:11.738 --> 01:12.705
MARIA: Dad!

01:14.073 --> 01:15.542
Dad!

01:15.608 --> 01:17.744
-There was this Gorgon...
-Just give me a minute here...

01:22.248 --> 01:24.050
I know how you feel.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.586
I remember when I saw
that alien in Sarah Jane's
garden...

01:29.289 --> 01:31.424
So, Sarah Jane

01:31.491 --> 01:33.493
used to fly around
in space
with this guy...

01:33.560 --> 01:35.261
The Doctor.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.530
-And Luke's an alien?
-Not alien. He just isn't
quite human.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.999
The Bane made him.

01:40.066 --> 01:41.134
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

01:42.735 --> 01:44.270
This is serious stuff, Maria.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.772
You're not going
to tell Mum, are you?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.807
(SCOFFS)
Like she'd believe me.

01:47.874 --> 01:51.511
Like I'd believe me
if I hadn't been bumping
between alternate realities

01:51.578 --> 01:53.546
and seen us almost
flattened by a meteor.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.449
No, I'm not going
to tell your mother.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.318
Tomorrow morning I'm putting
this house on the market.

01:58.384 --> 01:59.953
What?

02:00.019 --> 02:02.322
-You can't!
-This isn't
kids' stuff, Maria.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.858
It's dangerous,
we're going to have to move.

02:22.408 --> 02:25.011
There. Just below Bellatrix
on Orion's shoulder.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.013
You see, Luke?
That's where they'll come.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.750
Sarah Jane!
Dad says we're moving.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.887
He says I can't have anything
to do with you any more.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.823
-He says it's too dangerous.
-Well, it is dangerous.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.324
That's not the point!

02:38.391 --> 02:41.594
No parent wants to see
their child in danger, Maria.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.031
I know your father has
a lot more to worry about
than most dads.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.933
You can't blame him
for wanting to keep you safe.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.868
But, if you talk to him.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.870
I don't know what I would say.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.806
Tell him about the magic.
How wonderful it is.
The universe.

02:53.873 --> 02:55.842
Perhaps it is.

02:55.909 --> 02:59.112
You said it, Maria,
it's not all sparkling stars
and moonlight.

02:59.178 --> 03:03.182
Yeah, well, sometimes
things from space
are evil and scary,

03:03.249 --> 03:05.552
but how's that so different
from here on Earth?

03:05.618 --> 03:09.088
And sometimes things
from space are amazing
and beautiful.

03:09.155 --> 03:12.592
And you realise how
incredible it all is.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.461
We're part of something
so much bigger than living
here on Bannerman Road.

03:17.096 --> 03:21.000
Life is so much more
than most people
will ever know,

03:21.067 --> 03:23.836
and I've been
really lucky, Dad.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.773
I've seen that,
I can't give it up.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.742
This is too much to take in...

03:29.809 --> 03:31.444
That's the Universe, Alan.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.813
Once it's chosen to show you
some of its secrets,

03:33.880 --> 03:36.849
you can't ever turn
your back on it.
None of us can.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.552
No. I suppose not.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.856
I've got a lot to get used to,
haven't I?

03:47.427 --> 03:48.394
(LAUGHS)

03:51.631 --> 03:52.999
(BEEPING)

03:53.066 --> 03:55.034
The Kalazian Lights
are about to appear.

03:58.504 --> 04:02.075
The last time they were
visible from Earth
was four thousand years ago.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.745
The universe is
smiling on us tonight.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.815
Let's hope it always does.

04:12.752 --> 04:17.223
It's been, um, five months
since we saw Ashley.

04:17.290 --> 04:21.027
But we pray every night that
he's out there somewhere.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.197
Unharmed.

04:24.263 --> 04:26.966
And that he'll come
back to us soon.

04:27.033 --> 04:31.638
<i>If you're out there, Ashley,</i>
<i>just call your mum and dad.</i>

04:31.704 --> 04:32.905
<i>Please.</i> (SOBBING)

04:36.776 --> 04:39.078
If the human race
is going to survive climate
change, Luke,

04:39.145 --> 04:40.847
you have to give it
a helping hand,

04:40.913 --> 04:42.749
not to mention
my electricity bill.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.085
What have you done
with the remote?

04:46.152 --> 04:49.022
<i>If you can't have</i>
<i>children of your own,</i>

04:49.088 --> 04:53.593
<i>if that's why</i>
<i>you've taken him,</i>
<i>because you're lonely.</i>

04:53.660 --> 04:56.763
<i>How do you think I feel</i>
<i>without my angel boy?</i>

04:56.829 --> 04:59.365
-MARIA: They look
worried sick.
-You were right, love.

04:59.432 --> 05:03.102
There's things here on Earth
that make your blood run cold,
never mind from outer space.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.271
<i>If anybody knows</i>
<i>where Ashley is,</i>

05:05.338 --> 05:06.873
<i>please contact the police.</i>

05:08.274 --> 05:09.409
ALAN: Isn't that Luke?

05:10.276 --> 05:11.144
(MAN ON TV SPEAKING)

05:13.413 --> 05:15.014
No. It can't be.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.985
Luke? It's you.

05:32.632 --> 05:33.866
You're my mum.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.839
Mr Smith, I need you.
More than ever.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.007
(HISSING)

05:45.945 --> 05:47.580
MR SMITH: <i>I have been</i>
<i>monitoring the news.</i>

05:47.647 --> 05:49.582
It can't be true.

05:49.649 --> 05:53.953
Luke was created
by the Bane to absorb
human brain patterns.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.988
Did they model him on this
missing boy? Is that it?

05:56.055 --> 05:58.725
<i>There's only one way</i>
<i>to be certain.</i>
<i>I need to scan Luke.</i>

05:58.791 --> 06:01.227
No. The Bane made me.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.663
(SCREAMS)

06:03.730 --> 06:06.733
LUKE: <i>I don't remember anyone</i>
<i>or anything before I woke up</i>
<i>in Bane's laboratory.</i>

06:08.768 --> 06:10.036
<i>Then I met Maria.</i>

06:10.103 --> 06:12.739
-Um... Hello.
-Um... Hello.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.743
LUKE: <i>And I met you.</i>

06:18.177 --> 06:20.012
SARAH JANE: What are
you doing here?

06:20.079 --> 06:23.049
-I could ask you the same!
-Who's he? What have
they done to you?

06:23.116 --> 06:26.018
It's all right, Luke.
But we have to be sure.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.591
MR SMITH: <i>This won't hurt</i>
<i>at all, Luke.</i>

06:34.293 --> 06:35.862
(BEEPING)

06:41.534 --> 06:43.436
-Well?
<i>-I am assessing.</i>

06:45.271 --> 06:46.272
(BEEPS)

06:46.339 --> 06:47.874
<i>My assessment is complete.</i>

06:47.940 --> 06:50.143
<i>My cellular scan</i>
<i>and DNA cross-reference</i>

-And?
<i>-I have a comprehensive</i>

06:55.715 --> 06:57.316
What?

06:57.383 --> 06:59.685
<i>Luke and Ashley Stafford</i>
<i>are the same person.</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:01.521
No, there must be
some mistake.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.357
<i>-I don't make mistakes.</i>
<i>That is a human trait.</i>
-The Bane made me!

07:04.423 --> 07:06.292
You know they did!

07:06.359 --> 07:09.595
Mr Smith, this doesn't
make any sense,
Luke was never born.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.731
He doesn't have a navel.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.300
<i>Bane society, being egg-born,</i>
<i>find the navel crude</i>
<i>and offensive.</i>

07:14.367 --> 07:17.804
<i>They would've surgically</i>
<i>removed it at the time he was</i>
<i>programmed as the archetype.</i>

07:17.870 --> 07:19.071
But you're my mum.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.644
Mr Smith, is there
any chance at all?

07:24.710 --> 07:28.815
<i>Chances of DNA mismatch,</i>
<i>approximately</i>
<i>four billion to one.</i>

07:31.818 --> 07:35.655
What did I say? I told you
there was something not quite
right about Contrary Jane

07:35.721 --> 07:37.290
and that so-called
son of hers.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.992
-It's a mistake.
It can't be Luke.
-And why's that?

07:41.127 --> 07:43.029
It just can't.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.665
Well, let's let the police
make up their minds
about that, shall we?

07:45.731 --> 07:47.300
The police?

07:47.366 --> 07:49.202
-Mum, you never
called the police?
-(SIREN BLARING)

07:49.268 --> 07:51.103

again there's something
wrong with that woman.

07:51.170 --> 07:54.540
-I can smell it on her.
-Mum! No!

07:54.607 --> 07:56.909
I've told you, she's a weirdo.
You'll see.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.712
(DOORBELL RINGING)

08:02.782 --> 08:04.684
Sarah Jane Smith?

08:04.750 --> 08:07.587
He's here.
Will you just give me
a minute please?

08:15.294 --> 08:16.596
What's going to happen?

08:18.464 --> 08:20.867
I expect the police will
take us to the station.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.703
They'll question me,
and you'll see your
parents again,

08:23.769 --> 08:25.171
your real parents.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.206
So why can't I remember them?

08:27.273 --> 08:29.075
I know all sorts of things...

08:29.141 --> 08:32.245
Quantum Theory, Magnusark's
Law of Hyper-Dimensional
Relativity.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.715
I can remember every
page of every book
I've ever read.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.083
So why can't
I remember them?

08:38.150 --> 08:40.152
I wish I had all
the answers, Luke.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.755
I know this is difficult.
You must know I do.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.557
But this isn't a bad day.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.193
Mr and Mrs Stafford
are your real parents.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.060
They love you.

08:49.795 --> 08:52.465
-But don't you love me?
-Of course I do.

08:52.531 --> 08:55.868
But you don't belong
with me, Luke.

08:55.935 --> 08:59.171
Your mum and dad have spent
months searching for you.

08:59.238 --> 09:02.742
The Bane took you away,
and broke their hearts.

09:02.808 --> 09:06.479
Today is the most
wonderful day in their lives,
they're going to get you back.

09:06.545 --> 09:09.148
And you're going to be
an ordinary human boy

09:09.215 --> 09:13.152
with parents that care for you
and won't ever let anything
bad happen to you again.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.553
The way I never could.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.756
And it's the best day
of your life, too.

09:17.857 --> 09:18.858
You'll see.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.799
So it's right, then?
It is Luke?

09:26.866 --> 09:28.968
Wake up, Clyde.
How can it be Luke?

09:29.035 --> 09:32.505
-What, you mean the belly?
-Look, it's the mum and dad.

09:32.571 --> 09:34.941
SARAH JANE: Don't be nervous,
Luke, it's going to be okay,

09:35.007 --> 09:36.809
they're your real parents,
it will be all right.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.145
Here she comes.
Calamity Jane.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.081
-Ashley! Ashley!
-Everything's going
to be fine. I promise.

09:42.148 --> 09:46.519
Ashley, oh, thank God!
Thank God you're all right!

09:46.585 --> 09:49.822
Oh, my baby!
My beautiful baby boy!

09:49.889 --> 09:52.124
Are you really my mother?

09:52.191 --> 09:55.328
-Was I born from your womb?
-Ashley, what are you...

09:55.394 --> 09:57.330
Of course,
I'm your mother.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.798
Don't you remember us, Son?

09:58.864 --> 09:59.999
No.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.235
What have you done to him,
you witch?

10:03.302 --> 10:05.871
-OFFICER: Mrs Stafford,
please...
-Mum! This is all your fault!

10:05.938 --> 10:09.842
Me? I don't go kidnapping
young boys and passing
them off as my own.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.077
Chrissie,
for goodness' sake...

10:11.143 --> 10:13.279
I haven't harmed him,
I swear to you.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.882
Luke... Ashley...
He had an accident.
He's lost his memory.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.985
SARAH JANE: I'd no idea he had
parents looking for him.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.720
You thought the
fairies left him,
did you?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.922
You make me sick!

10:22.989 --> 10:25.858
I think we'd better talk this
through down at the station,
don't you, Miss Smith?

10:27.693 --> 10:29.595
MARIA: Dad,
they're arresting her,
do something!

10:29.662 --> 10:31.831
You wait, when it gets
to court it will all come out.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.266
Goodness knows what
secrets she's been hiding.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.869
Just leave it, Chrissie.
There's nothing
we can do, darling.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.139
Mum, no!

10:40.973 --> 10:42.241
(MOUTHING)

10:42.308 --> 10:44.610
Come on, Ashley,
let's get you home, yeah.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.766
Seems you've got powerful
friends, Miss Smith.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.102
My friends have

<i>of great assistance.</i>

23:37.415 --> 23:40.285
Sarah Jane Smith has seen
the telekinetic energiser!

23:40.352 --> 23:42.420
The idiot gave
her a demonstration!

23:42.487 --> 23:44.689
-She doesn't know anything.
-She must know something,

23:44.756 --> 23:46.224
you gravy-brained moron,

23:46.291 --> 23:47.993
or she wouldn't
have been in the lab,
would she?

23:48.059 --> 23:49.795
Look, there's no need
to talk to him like that!

23:49.861 --> 23:51.596
This is my mission,

23:51.663 --> 23:53.832
I can talk to him
anyway I like!

23:58.436 --> 24:00.906
The Xylok said she might
come poking her nose in.

24:00.972 --> 24:02.307
It said it would
take care of her.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.608
The Xylok!

24:03.675 --> 24:06.344
Do you really think
we can trust a Xylok?

24:06.411 --> 24:09.147
The plan's too far advanced.
She can't stop us.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.348
We've got
the Bane's Archetype.

24:10.415 --> 24:11.483
We've got the boy.

24:11.550 --> 24:12.584
(STAIRS CREAKING)

24:12.651 --> 24:13.652
What was that?

24:17.856 --> 24:19.291
Gotcha.

24:19.357 --> 24:20.158
Get in there.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.931
Ah, these new
slim-line flesh-suits,

24:26.131 --> 24:28.667
they might handle
the gas exchanges better,

24:28.733 --> 24:30.068
but they're a bit
on the snug side.

24:31.036 --> 24:31.870
(SIGHS)

24:38.009 --> 24:39.110
(LAUGHING)

24:46.184 --> 24:46.985
(GRUNTS)

24:53.658 --> 24:54.693
You're Slitheen?

25:01.233 --> 25:04.502
-But you're skinny!
-Amazing, isn't it?

25:04.569 --> 25:09.507
With this technology
I can eat all
I want and still be a size 8.

25:09.574 --> 25:13.278
-And you?
-What? Don't you remember
me, Luke?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.113
How you killed my family

25:15.180 --> 25:17.782
and left me locked
in a sealed room to die?

25:19.017 --> 25:19.918
Carl?

25:21.052 --> 25:22.387
(LAUGHING)

25:31.997 --> 25:34.466
Same Slitheen, different skin.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.368
I teleported out and survived.

25:36.434 --> 25:38.837
My father wasn't so fortunate.

25:38.904 --> 25:41.873
And now I'm going
to get my revenge!

25:42.874 --> 25:44.142
(SLITHEENS LAUGHING)

25:47.445 --> 25:48.780
Sarah Jane!

26:08.667 --> 26:11.236
Mr Smith, I need you.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.470
(HISSING)

26:20.078 --> 26:22.047
MR SMITH:
<i>Clyde. What a pleasure.</i>

26:22.113 --> 26:23.915
What? Really?

26:23.982 --> 26:25.850
-Oh, cool.
<i>-You have something for me?</i>

26:26.985 --> 26:28.486
Yeah, as it happens.

26:29.721 --> 26:31.523
I got this...

26:31.589 --> 26:34.526
It's a picture of Luke
with that pair that
reckon he's their kid.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.462
Only I think it's a fake. See?

26:37.529 --> 26:39.264
I thought you could
do your analysing thing and...

26:39.331 --> 26:40.565
<i>You're right, Clyde.</i>

26:40.632 --> 26:42.767
<i>It is fake. I faked it.</i>

26:44.502 --> 26:47.238
You...
Am I missing something here?

26:47.305 --> 26:50.208
More than you
could ever imagine,
Clyde.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.910
What's going on?

26:51.977 --> 26:53.545
<i>I am a Xylok.</i>

26:53.611 --> 26:55.981
<i>I have a purpose.</i>

26:56.047 --> 26:58.717
<i>And you, Clyde,</i>
<i>are a part of it.</i>

26:59.584 --> 27:00.819
(GROANS)

27:03.021 --> 27:04.856
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

27:08.660 --> 27:10.829
SARAH JANE: <i>Telekinetic energy</i>
<i>fetches a huge price.</i>

27:10.895 --> 27:12.597
Clyde, where are you?

27:12.664 --> 27:14.766
Mr Smith's going
to kill us all
and I'm inside him!

27:16.701 --> 27:19.204
I trusted him with my life.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.139
(GASPS)

27:21.206 --> 27:24.109
We're taking on these aliens
with bottles of vinegar
from the chippy?

27:24.175 --> 27:26.544
We have to find Luke.
I gave him to the Slitheen.

27:26.611 --> 27:28.213
Whatever they want with him
I have to get him back.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.950
MR SMITH:
<i>At last, we can begin.</i>

27:32.017 --> 27:33.318
-(ZAPPING NOISE)
-(GROANS)

27:33.385 --> 27:34.686
It's not possible.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.489
Luke isn't possible.
Mr Smith isn't possible.

27:37.555 --> 27:39.891
But together, they're
bringing the moon crashing
down on Earth.
