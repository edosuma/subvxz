WEBVTT

00:16.125 --> 00:17.223
- Where'd he go?

00:17.258 --> 00:17.817
Where'd he go, where?

00:22.197 --> 00:26.133
Stay, go!

00:26.168 --> 00:26.595
Bad bear!

00:31.800 --> 00:35.373
Bad bear, stay, stay,
stay, stay, stay, stay!

00:37.674 --> 00:40.609
Oh, Lord God, I'm
sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:42.217 --> 00:42.809
Hey God.

00:45.682 --> 00:46.582
It's me, Gil!

00:47.783 --> 00:49.519
Look it, I know we
don't chit chat much

00:51.160 --> 00:53.193
and you know that I
am far from perfect,

00:54.823 --> 00:57.395
and if anybody deserved
to put on trial here,

00:57.430 --> 00:59.133
it's Gil Gilles.

00:59.168 --> 01:03.797
But God, please don't let
me get eaten by a bear.

01:03.832 --> 01:05.271
A bear, no!

01:07.935 --> 01:11.277
Oh, I mean, I might've pulled
a leg, man, a couple times,

01:11.312 --> 01:14.247
but you're all about
forgiveness, right?

01:14.282 --> 01:17.745
It's about forgiveness,
right?

01:22.455 --> 01:24.686
Oh, thank you, thank you!

01:24.721 --> 01:27.755
I'll take accountability
for whatever I've done!

01:27.790 --> 01:30.593
What'd I do? Wait,
did I kill that girl?

01:31.959 --> 01:35.598
Did I kill that girl?
Come on, give me a sign!

01:42.508 --> 01:46.180
Black flag, black flag.

02:20.381 --> 02:23.811
Push-to-pass, I knew she
was gonna be trouble.

02:38.531 --> 02:43.336
- Hey, handsome, got yourself
an occasion for that hangover?

02:44.273 --> 02:45.239
- It was a Thursday.

03:03.985 --> 03:06.392
- I think you might need
a little hair of the dog.

03:06.427 --> 03:08.262
- I do, right?

03:20.804 --> 03:21.737
- Oh, yeah.

03:29.351 --> 03:31.813
- That's just the kind of
woman I'd been praying for.

03:33.355 --> 03:36.686
A few dents, minor
scratches, but runs well.

03:46.566 --> 03:49.435
What I didn't count
on was those identical

03:49.470 --> 03:52.405
demon spawn twin
daughters of hers.

04:01.878 --> 04:03.812
That was a real
kick in the pants.

04:11.921 --> 04:16.022
Oh yeah, I, I think I
can maybe fix it, yeah.

04:16.057 --> 04:20.499
- Hey girls, this here
gentleman here is Gil Gilles.

04:20.534 --> 04:23.095
He's offered to take
a look at the Subaru.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.668
Ain't that kind of him?

04:24.703 --> 04:25.834
- How you girls doing?

04:33.679 --> 04:34.975
Mm, friendly type.

04:36.616 --> 04:38.451
- You know, I have been
known to make myself

04:38.486 --> 04:39.848
a pretty mean Hamburger Helper.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.621
What do I gotta do to
have you stay for dinner?

04:44.591 --> 04:45.953
- Well, if you insist,

04:45.988 --> 04:48.923
but I don't wanna intrude
on no family time.

04:51.026 --> 04:53.928
- Them girls, they're just
overprotective is all.

04:55.965 --> 04:57.767
You pay no attention
to them, all right?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.935
- You got no man looking
after things here?

05:02.774 --> 05:05.808
- No, their daddy's
serving life in Jackson.

05:06.877 --> 05:07.876
Robbery gone wrong.

05:09.748 --> 05:11.011
Can I get you
something to drink?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.453
- You got any cold suds?

05:15.017 --> 05:19.151
- You know, I think I might.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.791
- Huh, if you agree
to have one with me,

05:21.826 --> 05:23.760
well then I just
might have to have me

05:23.795 --> 05:26.895
some of that Hamburger
Helper and some cold suds.

05:26.930 --> 05:27.731
- Deal.

05:27.766 --> 05:29.370
- All right, all right.

05:33.805 --> 05:36.443
That woman spoke my language.

05:36.478 --> 05:38.907
It was more than
just a good time,

05:38.942 --> 05:40.744
more than just the laughter,

05:40.779 --> 05:43.780
the loud music,
and the libations.

05:43.815 --> 05:46.145
It took us far away
from our past failures.

05:46.180 --> 05:50.985
When I met my Sylvia I knew
my bachelor days were over.

06:04.803 --> 06:07.100
- Gil, I'm
gonna be late for work.

06:07.135 --> 06:09.872
- All that whining ain't
making anything drop faster.

06:11.612 --> 06:13.007
- Gross, Mom!

06:13.042 --> 06:15.141
- He'll be out in a minute!

06:15.176 --> 06:19.552
- Why is he here? He
has a home, kind of.

06:21.919 --> 06:24.491
- Ooh, yeah.

06:24.526 --> 06:26.185
- You're disgusting.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.528
- Your attitude
is disgusting.

06:38.672 --> 06:43.477
- Pizza rolls, I think I need
me a catch cake.

06:51.685 --> 06:52.519
Hey.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.785
- Morning, Gil.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.723
Hey, Peg.

06:58.758 --> 06:59.889
You need my help with something?

07:02.025 --> 07:02.859
What?

07:03.862 --> 07:05.565
Something you wanna say to me?

07:07.228 --> 07:08.832
- What? Why
you staring at me?

07:10.000 --> 07:10.966
- Not now.

07:11.001 --> 07:13.100
- I poured you some coffee.

07:13.135 --> 07:16.543
- Oh thank you, but
you know what they say?

07:16.578 --> 07:19.172
Waste not. I think
it's in the Bible.

07:19.207 --> 07:21.108
- You're
not even dressed?

07:21.143 --> 07:23.880
- Honey, I'm just, I'm not
feeling very well today.

07:23.915 --> 07:28.280
I was hoping Peggy, you might
switch shifts with me, please?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.622
Please?

07:29.657 --> 07:30.689
- I was already planning on it.

07:32.121 --> 07:32.686
I could drop Julie
off at the campground.

07:32.722 --> 07:34.924
Thanks.
- It's okay.

07:38.633 --> 07:39.962
- I might be late tonight.

07:39.997 --> 07:41.601
Jim offered to take
me on his boat.

07:43.231 --> 07:46.606
- I thought your hair looked
extra snazzy this morning.

07:46.641 --> 07:50.203
- Peggy, stay outta
my head. Let's go.

07:53.846 --> 07:56.715
- Hey, you just
have a good day at work.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.653
- Surprised you remember
what that word even means.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.280
- Hey.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.149
- Sylvia.

08:04.087 --> 08:06.054
I try with those
two. I really do.

08:06.089 --> 08:09.189
I, they're just
playing dirty air.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.671
I was the youngest of six
raised in the upper peninsula.

08:19.971 --> 08:22.103
My daddy was a hard man

08:23.370 --> 08:26.305
and mama deserted our
family when I was 12.

08:27.913 --> 08:30.045
She ran off with a
Finnish copper miner.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.279
Can't blame her.

08:33.314 --> 08:35.919
I left home at 13 and
never looked back.

08:37.692 --> 08:40.693
I ain't seen any of my siblings
since and I don't care to.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.126
I heard my mama died of lung
cancer a few years back.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.833
Ain't that a bag of donuts.

08:55.237 --> 08:56.742
- Child, you
have got to slow down.

08:56.777 --> 08:58.942
My feet are killing
me after my shift.

08:58.977 --> 09:01.274
- Mom, Julie
could be hurt or worse.

09:01.309 --> 09:02.847
- What are
you talking about?

09:02.882 --> 09:05.113
She probably just enjoying
some private time alone.

09:06.820 --> 09:09.183
- She went boating
with Jim earlier

09:09.218 --> 09:10.690
and I haven't heard
from her since.

09:10.725 --> 09:14.958
- Hey, what do you mean
she went boating with Jim?

09:16.291 --> 09:18.060
Who is Jim?

09:19.327 --> 09:21.767
No. Do you know Jim?

09:21.802 --> 09:22.966
Huh? Have you met him?

09:28.270 --> 09:29.808
You know, this is something
you might consider

09:29.843 --> 09:31.106
sharing with your mother.

09:33.044 --> 09:34.043
Pick it up. Come on.

09:39.281 --> 09:41.952
Gil, baby? Hey, it's me.

09:41.987 --> 09:44.152
I'm coming in. Don't shoot me.

09:48.323 --> 09:49.157
Gil.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.329
Gil, hey. Gil, baby.

09:56.364 --> 09:57.935
I need to talk to you
for a minute. Hey.

09:57.970 --> 09:59.035
- Gil, wake up.

09:59.070 --> 10:02.071
- Gil, come on. Hey.

10:02.106 --> 10:06.207
- Hey baby. What are
you doing in here?

10:06.242 --> 10:07.406
- Julie went boating with Jim

10:07.441 --> 10:09.342
and I haven't heard
from her since.

10:09.377 --> 10:11.344
Please, can I have your
help looking for her?

10:11.379 --> 10:13.049
- This is the
first time that one

10:13.084 --> 10:15.755
of Sylvia's brats
asked anything of me.

10:15.790 --> 10:17.790
I've surely have my
days where I wish

10:17.825 --> 10:20.353
those two would just disappear,

10:20.388 --> 10:24.390
but just maybe this situation
would change things.

10:24.425 --> 10:26.029
All right, enough
of this cackle fest.

10:26.064 --> 10:27.393
If we're gonna chop
down the Christmas tree,

10:27.428 --> 10:29.098
then we gotta get going.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.232
We'll have that boat in
the water by first light.

10:31.267 --> 10:34.400
Come on. Let's go.

11:22.153 --> 11:24.923
- Man, are we happy
to see you guys.

11:24.958 --> 11:27.288
Heck of a way to
meet Julie's family.

11:27.323 --> 11:29.158
- It's nice to
finally meet you, Jim.

11:30.326 --> 11:31.930
- Why didn't you call?

11:31.965 --> 11:34.031
- We would have if our
phones had services.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.901
- Kind of ran outta gas.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.398
Probably should have been paid
more attention to the gauges.

11:38.433 --> 11:39.938
- Yeah, a little gas
check might saved

11:39.973 --> 11:41.170
us all a lot of problems here.

11:43.009 --> 11:44.305
- You also lost the anchor.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.538
- Oh, anchor too.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.475
- Hey, uh, Gil, you think
you could give me a tow?

11:49.510 --> 11:50.916
- That's a negative.

11:50.951 --> 11:51.983
All right. Let's go.

11:52.018 --> 11:52.819
Got things to.

12:06.131 --> 12:08.428
I used to dream of
being that cool stepdad,

12:10.300 --> 12:12.201
being that I never
had much of a family.

12:13.534 --> 12:15.809
I think it was a fantasy
I often got lost in.

12:17.340 --> 12:19.241
I try to do right
by these brats.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.115
They're just plain uppity,
entitled and ungrateful.

12:28.219 --> 12:30.318
At least I only have to
deal with one of them soon.

12:40.902 --> 12:42.132
- People been
saying the same thing

12:42.167 --> 12:43.033
about us at their age.

12:45.104 --> 12:47.071
- Yeah, I'm worried
about their generation,

12:48.206 --> 12:49.469
bunch of backmarkers.

12:49.504 --> 12:51.438
- They just don't
know yet, that's all.

12:51.473 --> 12:52.274
- Oh, they will.

12:59.019 --> 13:01.118
You ever want
anything different?

13:01.153 --> 13:02.218
Had any dreams or anything?

13:05.894 --> 13:08.862
- Course, didn't we all?

13:18.236 --> 13:19.235
Dreams are for young people.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.472
- Yeah.

13:34.219 --> 13:35.614
Life has been destroying
youthful dreams

13:35.649 --> 13:36.956
as long as I can remember.

13:44.196 --> 13:45.030
Who's you, Betty Lou?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.628
- Okay. Okay.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.367
This is none o' your business,

13:52.402 --> 13:54.270
but since I'm in kind
of a good mood today,

13:54.305 --> 13:56.470
I'm gonna give you some scoop.

13:56.505 --> 13:59.440
My father's brother
owns this place,

13:59.475 --> 14:02.047
so naturally I came
over to run it.

14:02.082 --> 14:03.180
That makes me the manager.

14:04.282 --> 14:07.679
Unfortunately, when I got here

14:07.714 --> 14:11.023
somebody else thinks they
already wearing that title.

14:11.058 --> 14:11.584
Understand?

14:15.524 --> 14:18.030
- Hm, not really. No.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.295
- Okay, I don't need
any more problems

14:19.330 --> 14:20.934
with her thinking
I'm into her man.

14:20.969 --> 14:22.694
So I don't know if you're
trying to be some sort of cowboy

14:22.729 --> 14:24.630
or something, but I'm
still not into you.

14:24.665 --> 14:25.939
Okay. You're not my type.

14:32.211 --> 14:33.375
- I think she just insulted me.

14:34.675 --> 14:36.642
And when did that happen?

14:36.677 --> 14:39.051
- This morning, right
before Emmet left

14:39.086 --> 14:41.416
for Arizona to visit his mother.

14:43.585 --> 14:45.585
- Sorry, sorry!
- You are taking forever!

14:45.620 --> 14:47.257
- You're in my kitchen!
- I mean it!

14:47.292 --> 14:48.423
Every single one of them
that's out there is waiting.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.290
- Go over there.
Don't touch anything.

14:49.326 --> 14:50.557
- No, let me take this out.

14:52.528 --> 14:53.659
- Yeah.

14:53.694 --> 14:55.364
- Don't laugh. It isn't funny.

14:55.399 --> 14:58.334
- Oh, it's the funniest
thing I've seen all week.

14:58.369 --> 14:59.665
- I cannot work with you!
- Get...

14:59.700 --> 15:02.701
- Hey babe. Mandy's gonna
give me a ride home, okay?

15:02.736 --> 15:07.442
So I'll see you later
tonight. Kisses.

15:19.423 --> 15:21.423
- So I'm not really sure
what you're seeing in him,

15:21.458 --> 15:23.359
'cause I don't see what you see.

15:25.528 --> 15:27.165
- Just 'cause I'm
letting you drive me home

15:27.200 --> 15:28.463
don't mean we're friends,

15:29.697 --> 15:31.598
especially you keep
bad mouthing my a man.

15:33.107 --> 15:34.568
- Well, I wasn't asking
to be your friend.

15:36.176 --> 15:39.210
Forget it. Now I'm
not saying nothing.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.353
- What?

15:52.588 --> 15:53.752
- I'm just telling you,

15:53.787 --> 15:56.029
everybody in this town
is a little weird,

15:56.064 --> 15:57.459
so I got my eyes everywhere.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.429
And from working in the
salon for so many years,

16:00.464 --> 16:01.397
I know what I see

16:03.104 --> 16:05.203
and what I see was
your two daughters

16:05.238 --> 16:08.701
walking down the street with
not a lot of fabric on 'em.

16:08.736 --> 16:12.210
- What are you talking about,
not a lot of fabric on 'em?

16:12.245 --> 16:15.411
- And then I seen your
man's truck in the same area.

16:15.446 --> 16:17.644
Like I said, I
worked at a salon.

16:17.679 --> 16:19.382
- What are you saying?

16:19.417 --> 16:20.812
- I'm just saying it's weird

16:20.847 --> 16:22.715
and people at the
salon would be talking.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.141
Ready, set, go.

16:47.478 --> 16:51.315
- So that's why you so gassed
up to get to work every day.

16:51.350 --> 16:53.251
- What are you doing here?

16:53.286 --> 16:56.287
- Getting tired of you sassing
me all the time, little girl.

16:56.322 --> 16:57.321
- What brings you here, Gil?

16:58.192 --> 16:59.851
- This.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.853
I retrieved it from the shore
and thought I'd be helpful

17:01.888 --> 17:04.493
and bring it back,
but as always,

17:04.528 --> 17:06.759
you got everything
you want from me.

17:06.794 --> 17:09.267
Back to talking
down to Gil again.

17:10.303 --> 17:12.402
Listen, I love your mama

17:13.438 --> 17:14.833
and you and your sister are just

17:14.868 --> 17:16.670
gonna have to get
used to them facts.

17:17.805 --> 17:20.344
And you, you better be careful.

17:20.379 --> 17:21.774
She's gonna start
clerking your course

17:21.809 --> 17:23.578
once she gets what she wants.

17:25.186 --> 17:25.613
- Thanks, Gil.

17:30.224 --> 17:33.258
- First are worst.
Game respects game.

17:35.823 --> 17:37.592
All right. You two
have a good day.

17:40.531 --> 17:41.365
You know,

17:43.864 --> 17:47.503
life, life is about survival

17:48.704 --> 17:50.605
and it's about gratitude.

17:51.872 --> 17:53.740
See, I'm grateful.

17:53.775 --> 17:56.182
I'm grateful it's
a beautiful day.

17:56.217 --> 17:57.546
I'm grateful I'm alive.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.450
I'm grateful I got
your mom in my life.

18:02.289 --> 18:06.390
See, if you're lucky, you'll
learn about the power of love.

18:08.526 --> 18:10.394
- You're drunk.

18:10.429 --> 18:12.330
- No, I'm not.

18:12.365 --> 18:15.201
Your mama has got me drinking
light beer for my day drinking

18:15.236 --> 18:17.665
and everybody knows you can't
get drunk on light beer.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.306
So no, I got things to do.

18:24.773 --> 18:28.247
Drive through pain. Good day.

18:28.282 --> 18:29.875
Ready, set, go.

18:29.910 --> 18:31.547
- Can't believe you have to
deal with that every day.

18:34.453 --> 18:38.323
- Okay, Jules. I'll
see you later tonight.

18:38.358 --> 18:39.555
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

18:40.624 --> 18:41.524
Love you. Bye.

18:44.298 --> 18:46.727
Oh, I think
Jules is falling.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.962
She's gone out with
that Jim guy again.

18:50.997 --> 18:54.933
And Peggy is out with
the girls, which...

18:54.968 --> 18:59.674
- Which means gone, gone.
Mama bear's got no kids.

19:04.450 --> 19:05.680
It's all good.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.753
- I'm counting on
you being a good one.

19:14.328 --> 19:15.228
- Oh, I try.

19:18.662 --> 19:21.663
- Try ain't good enough.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.604
You lay a finger on me or
one of the girls in anger

19:30.575 --> 19:31.508
and I will kill you.

19:33.446 --> 19:34.511
You believe my words?

19:36.845 --> 19:38.713
- Oh yeah, I believe your words.

19:41.850 --> 19:42.750
- Good. Here.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.390
- You know-

19:45.425 --> 19:47.359
- 'Cause I would
kill for what I love

19:47.394 --> 19:48.987
and I do love you Gil Gilles.

19:51.860 --> 19:54.762
I'd protect what I love
with my dying breath.

19:54.797 --> 19:59.338
I ain't got much, but I
do love deep what's mine.

19:59.373 --> 20:01.032
- Let me take this
opportunity, Sylvia,

20:01.067 --> 20:02.869
to apologize for
anything that my

20:04.609 --> 20:07.379
idiotic mouth might have
spouted when I'd been drinking.

20:08.382 --> 20:09.975
- Okay.

20:10.010 --> 20:12.879
You just saying that on
account of me talking killing.

20:12.914 --> 20:17.653
- No, no, I'm not.
Serious moment, Sylvia.

20:18.524 --> 20:19.323
Serious moment.

20:20.988 --> 20:23.758
You need to know,
no, listen to me.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.433
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me,

20:28.468 --> 20:29.632
you know that.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.998
I sat on a bar stool for years

20:33.033 --> 20:35.968
praying to God to send
me someone to love

20:36.003 --> 20:37.871
and who would love
me for all my flaws.

20:39.446 --> 20:39.840
And he sent you.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.712
Without you, I would've just

20:45.716 --> 20:47.320
died alone in that trailer.

20:51.986 --> 20:53.623
And you're the
only family I got.

20:56.958 --> 21:01.664
- I'm feeling so dance
stimulated right now.

21:03.063 --> 21:04.436
- Really?

21:05.637 --> 21:06.933
Now is that like
kiss dance stimulated

21:06.968 --> 21:09.474
or Peter Frampton
dance stimulated?

21:18.980 --> 21:22.718
♪ Shimmer, shade
and golden shine ♪

21:22.753 --> 21:26.656
♪ Busy polishing your shrine ♪

21:26.691 --> 21:31.496
♪ Happy living deep
inside your mind ♪

21:34.402 --> 21:35.467
♪ Doesn't take a- ♪

21:48.812 --> 21:50.779
- Sad, isn't it?

21:50.814 --> 21:53.419
- I didn't expect you to
be back until tomorrow.

21:53.454 --> 21:56.048
- I didn't have enough
money to go out after.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.050
Plus I really wanted
to come home and pack.

22:00.054 --> 22:01.757
I can't believe
I'm actually going.

22:02.793 --> 22:04.089
- Look what you'll be missing.

22:08.062 --> 22:10.128
- I hope Gil got the
car running better.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.404
- He was working on it
a good part of the day,

22:11.439 --> 22:13.670
but you know Gil.

22:13.705 --> 22:15.441
Does he ever finish anything?

22:19.810 --> 22:21.876
- Them girls are starting
to green my rubber.

22:50.742 --> 22:51.543
- Mom up?

22:51.578 --> 22:52.973
- Nope.

22:53.008 --> 22:54.579
- Your mom
ain't quite feeling

22:54.614 --> 22:55.877
the groove this morning.

22:55.912 --> 22:57.714
- Wonder why.

22:57.749 --> 23:00.145
- You know, your mama
really works hard

23:00.180 --> 23:02.180
to take care of the two of you.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.655
Maybe you should
try, I don't know,

23:04.690 --> 23:07.691
maybe giving her a little
bit more appreciation.

23:07.726 --> 23:10.661
- Why are you here?

23:10.696 --> 23:13.191
- Oh, I'm good enough to
wrench on your vehicle

23:13.226 --> 23:16.095
all afternoon, but
not good enough

23:16.130 --> 23:17.833
to park here with
the love of my life?

23:19.199 --> 23:20.099
Okay, just because
your mom and I like

23:20.134 --> 23:22.035
to party and blow off steam

23:22.070 --> 23:23.938
don't mean that we don't
handle our business.

23:25.744 --> 23:27.744
- Help me finish packing.

23:27.779 --> 23:28.712
Tell mom I love her
and I'll call her

23:28.747 --> 23:31.143
once I get settled in my dorm.

23:31.178 --> 23:34.454
- Yeah. I'm right
on that.

23:39.857 --> 23:41.087
Unbelievable little brats.

23:44.125 --> 23:47.126
Oh, that didn't sound real good.

23:47.161 --> 23:48.831
Maybe I, it'll hold.

23:53.673 --> 23:57.543
Well, well, what
do we have here?

24:00.108 --> 24:02.878
And just whose
skivvies are these?

24:07.049 --> 24:08.752
- Did I miss 'em? Are they gone?

24:08.787 --> 24:10.523
- Yeah, I think they're gone.

24:12.153 --> 24:14.252
- I thought Peggy would
have at least say goodbye.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.760
- You know
how them girls are.

24:16.795 --> 24:20.863
- Oh, I look awful.

24:20.898 --> 24:23.899
- No baby, you're
naturally beautiful.

24:23.934 --> 24:26.264
- That's just a polite
way of saying frumpy.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.872
- No way, you
are like white snake

24:29.907 --> 24:31.269
hood slidin' hot.

24:32.844 --> 24:35.515
You are baby, I'm
telling you. I know.

24:37.717 --> 24:39.849
Looky, I'm gonna run up to
Tink's and get some smokes.

24:39.884 --> 24:42.522
You need anything? Oh.

24:43.888 --> 24:45.756
- Aspirin.
- Somebody's got a headache.

24:45.791 --> 24:46.823
- I think we're out.

24:46.858 --> 24:48.891
- All right. I'll go get that.

24:48.926 --> 24:50.090
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:50.125 --> 24:51.861
Well, I'll be back
in just a few.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.079
- What's that noise?

25:13.819 --> 25:15.313
- I don't know.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.184
Gil was trying to fix it, but
I'm gonna grab a road coffee.

25:18.219 --> 25:21.121
- Oh now, won't you look who
done come seen ol' Tinker?

25:22.663 --> 25:23.827
How are you doing?
I'm all right.

25:23.862 --> 25:25.191
I reckon. I can't hear nothing.

25:25.226 --> 25:27.094
You gotta speak up, honey.

25:27.129 --> 25:28.260
- I have to use the bathroom.

25:28.295 --> 25:29.932
- Well, go right
back in there, and...

25:29.967 --> 25:32.000
I just cleaned it two weeks ago.

25:32.035 --> 25:33.298
Hey there, how are you doing?

25:34.906 --> 25:36.268
What's the matter with your car?

25:36.303 --> 25:37.742
I heard a rattle
when you pulled up.

25:37.777 --> 25:39.612
- Yeah, it's making
a weird noise.

25:39.647 --> 25:41.647
- How long has it
been doing that?

25:41.682 --> 25:43.308
- I don't know. I
just heard it today.

25:43.343 --> 25:44.881
- Here. Hold spit cup for me.

25:50.020 --> 25:52.053
I heard you got into university.

25:52.088 --> 25:53.857
- Yeah.

25:53.892 --> 25:55.826
- What are you gonna study?

25:55.861 --> 25:57.696
- Just basic
courses until I figure out

25:57.731 --> 25:59.027
what I wanna major in.

25:59.062 --> 26:00.094
- Well, that's all right.

26:04.034 --> 26:05.803
Here's your rattle.

26:30.896 --> 26:32.027
- Come on! Damn.

26:36.902 --> 26:41.201
Hey, you scrutineer, Tinker. I
told them already I fixed it.

26:41.236 --> 26:44.204
- Well, there ain't no
harm in taking a look, Gil.

26:44.239 --> 26:45.744
According to what I
see, it looks like

26:45.779 --> 26:46.943
you bled the brakes just fine.

26:46.978 --> 26:48.813
It's a quality fix.

26:48.848 --> 26:51.343
- Hear what he
said? Quality fix.

26:51.378 --> 26:52.916
- You're still a stupid drunk.

26:52.951 --> 26:54.852
- Oh, I'm stupid.

26:54.887 --> 26:56.414
You know what I saw her
sister doing the other day

26:56.449 --> 26:59.824
on her fancy phone with the
little looky wooky thingy?

26:59.859 --> 27:01.826
She was looking up
how to boil water.

27:01.861 --> 27:05.962
You know what that is, that is
fire plus water equals boil.

27:05.997 --> 27:08.459
You imagine that? But
somehow I'm the stupid one.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.868
- Yeah. That's what I said.

27:10.903 --> 27:12.397
- You know how stupid you sound?

27:12.432 --> 27:14.168
Try not to do any
Tide pod shooters

27:14.203 --> 27:15.774
when you're away
at college, okay?

27:15.809 --> 27:17.006
- Shut up, Gil.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.173
- Oh, nice way to
win an argument.

27:19.208 --> 27:20.977
You pick up your
participation award

27:21.012 --> 27:24.310
at I don't give a flying flag.

27:24.345 --> 27:25.949
- Yo, you're gonna
have settle down, son.

27:25.984 --> 27:27.786
The world's a changing.

27:27.821 --> 27:28.985
You're just going
around everywhere,

27:29.020 --> 27:30.888
just like this, all
coiled up like a snake.

27:30.923 --> 27:32.791
You're ready to strike
at people all the time.

27:32.826 --> 27:34.188
They don't know what to think.

27:36.291 --> 27:37.125
- Was that mine?

27:39.162 --> 27:41.228
- I reckoned it's your'n.

27:41.263 --> 27:43.329
I found it laying on
the intake manifold

27:43.364 --> 27:45.199
and she pulled up here,
said car's a rattling

27:46.774 --> 27:47.971
and that's what
I found in there.

27:52.978 --> 27:54.208
- I got to get a few things.

27:56.542 --> 28:00.049
- Them Tide pots really
work, get your plates clean.

28:07.553 --> 28:10.994
- Too good to take a deep
break at the house, I see.

28:11.029 --> 28:13.425
- Real classy. What
are you doing here?

28:13.460 --> 28:17.462
- Uh, getting smokes and
some aspirin for your ma.

28:17.497 --> 28:19.530
- You know she has to
open at the midway, right?

28:19.565 --> 28:21.070
- Yes, I do.

28:22.403 --> 28:24.942
- Thank you, Tinker.
You're so sweet.

28:24.977 --> 28:26.306
- Youngin', I try.

28:26.341 --> 28:28.440
Listen now, on your
trip, when you get back

28:30.213 --> 28:32.048
bring that car in here and
I'll put you a new belt on her,

28:32.083 --> 28:33.247
put you a deco on there,

28:33.282 --> 28:35.788
but it'll be all right
through the trip.

28:35.823 --> 28:36.987
- Okay.

28:37.022 --> 28:38.483
- But stay away from
them rest stops.

28:38.518 --> 28:41.222
- I will. It was great
seeing you, Tinker.

28:41.257 --> 28:42.058
- Good to see you, honey.

28:42.093 --> 28:43.994
- I'll be in the car.

28:44.029 --> 28:45.798
Gil, you better
be good to my mom

28:45.833 --> 28:47.492
and my sister while I'm away.

28:47.527 --> 28:50.902
- Yeah, dirty air.
Shut your teenage talk box.

28:50.937 --> 28:51.529
But you too.

28:53.269 --> 28:54.169
- Tinker, can you put
this on my mom's tab?

28:54.204 --> 28:55.434
- What'd you say, honey?

28:55.469 --> 28:56.974
- Can you put this
on my mom's tab?

28:57.009 --> 28:58.041
- I surely can.

28:58.076 --> 28:58.910
- Thank you.

29:00.210 --> 29:02.210
- Good to see you.

29:04.049 --> 29:07.050
- Good. We can put a few
things on the tab, right?

29:07.085 --> 29:09.052
- Kind of like to have cash.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.246
- Like you, Gil.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.581
Sorry, Ike.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.022
- That's my, let me go.

29:45.057 --> 29:47.222
That's my car.

29:47.257 --> 29:49.620
- Gibenos is
scarce. Fire through there.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.325
Checking. Getting Gil out.

29:59.401 --> 30:01.137
- Maybe the panties
won't even come up.

30:04.439 --> 30:07.209
- I thought we already
talked about all this.

30:07.244 --> 30:09.607
It can change that
fast for Syliva,

30:09.642 --> 30:12.544
from love to hate
and back again.

30:12.579 --> 30:14.920
Add half dozen beers
and double jeopardy

30:14.955 --> 30:16.350
rules are in full effect.

30:17.958 --> 30:20.453
Her mood changes seem
to be more often.

30:20.488 --> 30:22.587
- Why did you ask if
Julie was gonna be here

30:22.622 --> 30:24.325
when we got here?

30:24.360 --> 30:26.162
- Because I wanted to know if
we had the house to ourselves.

30:26.197 --> 30:27.559
- Oh.
- What?

30:27.594 --> 30:30.034
She already got
that boyfriend, Jim.

30:30.069 --> 30:33.631
- Oh right, the guy has a
better truck than you do.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.138
- That entitled
turpile had his mommy

30:35.173 --> 30:36.337
and daddy buy it for him.

30:36.372 --> 30:39.604
- No!

30:39.639 --> 30:41.210
Oh, you gonna cry, Gil?

30:45.678 --> 30:47.249
- I'm not a wealthy man, Sylvia.

30:49.484 --> 30:50.351
Love is all I got.

30:51.519 --> 30:53.255
And I see that aint
nothing no more.

31:16.115 --> 31:20.150
♪ Back to this, you
ready for this ♪

31:41.140 --> 31:42.436
- Sylvia, I re...

31:43.703 --> 31:46.671
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

31:46.706 --> 31:48.574
I can't understand you
when you're crying.

31:50.644 --> 31:53.414
Arrested? Wait, let me
put you on speakerphone.

31:56.254 --> 31:57.583
My heart knows how to pick 'em.

31:59.191 --> 32:02.390
Seems Sylvia had herself
a one person ramp run.

32:02.425 --> 32:05.426
Got so wasted she woke up and
thought she was late for work.

32:06.660 --> 32:09.232
She didn't remember
showering or dressing,

32:09.267 --> 32:11.168
but remembered climbing
into the Subaru

32:11.203 --> 32:13.632
and backing out of the drive.

32:13.667 --> 32:16.569
Constable Calvin Greeney-Pierce
found Sylvia in a ditch,

32:16.604 --> 32:19.407
passed out just down the road.

32:19.442 --> 32:22.047
They confiscated
her driver's license

32:22.082 --> 32:24.346
and they put her in county
lock-up until her hearing.

32:25.679 --> 32:26.711
And my real fear
was her not getting

32:26.746 --> 32:28.383
her daily intake o' drink.

32:29.749 --> 32:32.123
After so many years, the
devil's drink not only

32:32.158 --> 32:36.424
has it hooks into your body,
but your mind, your soul.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.435
Excuse me. That's,
uh, that's my woman.

32:47.470 --> 32:49.107
That's, that's the woman I love.

32:50.737 --> 32:52.374
- Why does this have
to be the only place

32:52.409 --> 32:54.244
to eat and drink in town?

32:54.279 --> 32:56.048
- You wanna go somewhere else?

32:56.083 --> 33:00.349
- Hey, what's going
on with your mama?

33:00.384 --> 33:01.482
Heard she went to the hospital

33:01.517 --> 33:03.022
and now she's stuck in county.

33:04.652 --> 33:06.520
Damn Calvin Greeney, I swear
he's drunk in his cop car

33:06.555 --> 33:08.093
half the time cruising around.

33:08.128 --> 33:09.028
- Mom'll live.

33:10.691 --> 33:12.823
- Your mama has given you
the best years of her life

33:12.858 --> 33:14.792
and that's what she's
gonna get from you?

33:14.827 --> 33:17.069
You and your sister just
a couple of snooty brats

33:17.104 --> 33:18.796
who need to be taken
down a few pegs.

33:18.831 --> 33:19.731
- Yeah, why don't you
just get outta here, man?

33:19.766 --> 33:21.832
- Jim, why don't you shut up?

33:21.867 --> 33:23.768
I don't think I was
talking to you at all.

33:23.803 --> 33:25.275
- I ain't gonna tell
you twice, old man.

33:25.310 --> 33:26.474
- Old man?

33:26.509 --> 33:27.409
- Feeling tough?

33:27.444 --> 33:28.839
- Oh look, it, you know what?

33:28.874 --> 33:31.479
This ain't punk locker
room posturin' time.

33:31.514 --> 33:33.316
I would beat the shiny off you.

33:33.351 --> 33:34.383
- You wanna go?

33:34.418 --> 33:35.549
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

33:35.584 --> 33:36.352
- What do you want?
What you want?

33:36.387 --> 33:37.815
You want some boxing?

33:37.850 --> 33:39.619
Boom, would you also like
karate with this whole thing?

33:39.654 --> 33:41.687
What you want?
- Okay, okay, okay.

33:41.722 --> 33:42.688
Please, stop, stop, stop it.
- What you want?

33:42.723 --> 33:44.492
What you want, Jim?
- This little cat fight you

33:44.527 --> 33:45.226
boys got brewing's
gonna stop now, okay?

33:45.261 --> 33:46.593
- What you want? What you want?

33:46.628 --> 33:48.364
- Chill, take a
breath. Take a breath.

33:48.399 --> 33:50.300
- What, what, what?

33:50.335 --> 33:53.732
- Both of you realize this
ain't happenin' in here.

33:53.767 --> 33:56.702
Uh-uh. You, get him out of here.

33:58.211 --> 33:58.605
Go sit!

34:00.279 --> 34:01.740
- I ain't gonna sit.

34:01.775 --> 34:02.873
I want play some darts.
Who wants play some darts?

34:02.908 --> 34:04.710
I'm see some money.

34:04.745 --> 34:07.350
And Mandy, how about you get
me a double on the rocks.

34:07.385 --> 34:08.780
All right?

34:08.815 --> 34:09.380
- I'm not
getting you nothing.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.181
- Damn kids these days.

34:15.294 --> 34:16.557
- I talk big.

34:16.592 --> 34:20.330
I was gonna see my love
set free at any cost.

34:20.365 --> 34:23.630
Her companionship and
lovin' had truly saved me.

34:27.174 --> 34:27.799
Oh.

34:29.374 --> 34:30.901
- I'm gonna change that.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.639
Wait, I'm putting
it on speaker phone.

34:32.674 --> 34:35.576
Don't go nowhere. Sylvia?

34:35.611 --> 34:39.382
- Gil, I need to borrow
just a little bit of money.

34:40.847 --> 34:42.187
I got into some trouble.

34:43.586 --> 34:48.391
- Uh, what do you want
me to do about it?

34:49.757 --> 34:52.494
- Ha, not
funny. Come on baby.

34:52.529 --> 34:53.792
You know I'm good for it.

34:53.827 --> 34:55.431
- I might be
able to contribute

34:55.466 --> 34:56.894
like a hundred or something.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.369
- I gotta
get outta here.

34:59.404 --> 35:01.734
I don't feel good.

35:01.769 --> 35:03.670
- Um, I, I'll,

35:05.476 --> 35:07.674
I'll see what I can do.

35:07.709 --> 35:10.743
- They're making me
go. Love you.

35:10.778 --> 35:13.845
- Sylvia? Sylvia?

35:20.227 --> 35:23.723
What the heck.

35:24.594 --> 35:26.693
It's beer.

35:28.664 --> 35:30.631
'Sup, Rowdy. Rowdy,
Rowdy rooster.

36:32.992 --> 36:35.795
Call it wisdom or luck,
it's been a long time

36:35.830 --> 36:37.500
since I myself
have walked through

36:37.535 --> 36:39.832
those was steely
doors to freedom.

36:39.867 --> 36:42.340
I don't recall much
of the last event,

36:42.375 --> 36:46.773
other than I had an ample
amount of bruises on my body.

36:46.808 --> 36:48.709
Apparently it was
from resisting arrest.

36:54.519 --> 36:57.652
- So you take care, all right?
I'll be praying for you.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.766
- Come on. Let's get
out of this dump.

37:14.803 --> 37:15.703
- Mr. Gilles.

37:17.476 --> 37:18.310
- Eddie.

37:31.391 --> 37:32.555
- I'm not
feeling very well.

37:34.427 --> 37:38.726
- I'll be right back.
Stay in the truck, alright?

37:38.761 --> 37:42.730
- When I was in the hospital
the doctor did an evaluation.

37:46.406 --> 37:51.002
They said I had some type
of psychosis.

37:53.677 --> 37:54.775
I don't know what that means.

38:01.817 --> 38:04.554
- No, no,
no, no. Not the beer.

38:04.589 --> 38:07.722
Wait, Sylvie, I'm
coming. I got it, baby.

38:07.757 --> 38:10.857
Here baby, they're going
overboard. Get it down.

38:10.892 --> 38:12.562
You good? Oh my God.

38:14.599 --> 38:15.730
Oh, slow down. Slow down.

38:15.765 --> 38:16.764
We got a lot.

38:16.799 --> 38:18.128
Let it work. Let it work.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.734
It's all right. There you go.

38:19.769 --> 38:21.769
There you go. See, see?

38:21.804 --> 38:23.573
You're good. There you go.

38:23.608 --> 38:26.576
Slow, slow, slow. Whoa,
what are you doing?

38:27.810 --> 38:28.743
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What is it?

38:28.778 --> 38:30.008
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.449
- Get it off of me!
- What are you talking about?

38:33.651 --> 38:34.815
- Sylvia,
no, come back here!

38:34.850 --> 38:37.950
Sylvia, got go nowhere.
Stay with the truck.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.116
- Please,
he's gonna kill me.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.855
Killer's gonna kill me.

38:41.890 --> 38:43.087
- You got nothing.
- Look at...

38:43.122 --> 38:44.990
- You got nothing. You
got nothing on you.

38:45.025 --> 38:46.794
Nothing is on you at all.

38:46.829 --> 38:49.027
Nothing, honey. You'll be fine.

38:49.062 --> 38:50.996
Get back in it. Get
back in the truck.

38:51.031 --> 38:54.131
Please, it's me,
honey. Stay with me.

38:54.166 --> 38:58.773
Get back in. Get back in
the truck.

39:02.977 --> 39:06.583
Stay in the truck.
Stay in the truck.

39:10.490 --> 39:12.655
- What? Look at them.

39:12.690 --> 39:13.722
- No, no, no.

39:13.757 --> 39:15.757
- They're gonna kill me.

39:18.058 --> 39:21.125
- It's all right.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.067
- What's going on, Harold?

39:29.102 --> 39:30.002
- Huh?

39:30.037 --> 39:31.070
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

39:33.106 --> 39:34.138
I can't go back. I can't go
back, they're killing me.

39:34.173 --> 39:36.206
- Sylvia, can I help here?

39:36.241 --> 39:38.714
- They're gonna kill.
- Sylvia. Sylvia, no, Sylvia!

39:38.749 --> 39:40.551
- I can't go back.

39:40.586 --> 39:41.684
I can't.
- Greeney!

39:41.719 --> 39:44.621
- Can't go back. Can't.

39:46.119 --> 39:47.855
I see you! I see you!

39:49.089 --> 39:50.022
I do.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.221
- What's going on, Harold?

39:51.256 --> 39:52.156
- I don't know.

39:52.191 --> 39:53.564
She's been misfiring like this

39:53.599 --> 39:54.697
ever since I picked
her up at the hospital.

39:54.732 --> 39:56.798
I think she needs to go back.

39:56.833 --> 39:59.130
- Sylvia's done gone crazier
than a doogle over there.

39:59.165 --> 40:02.969
She says she's got a bomb.
She's turned my place up.

40:03.004 --> 40:04.608
Need some help!

40:04.643 --> 40:07.204
- She doesn't have a
bomb, Greeney. She's sick.

40:09.142 --> 40:10.944
- 221 to central.

40:10.979 --> 40:13.881
We're gonna be transporting
a female to county general.

40:13.916 --> 40:15.553
That's gonna be on a PRT.

40:22.727 --> 40:25.090
- Can't kill me. I know it.

40:25.125 --> 40:27.565
I know it. You can't kill me.

40:38.171 --> 40:40.039
- Don't get behind
that wheel, Harold.

40:41.207 --> 40:43.042
You do, you're going to jail.

40:43.077 --> 40:44.549
I smelled beer on your breath.

40:46.982 --> 40:47.783
You copy me?

40:50.755 --> 40:51.556
- Copy.

40:57.223 --> 40:59.531
Seen many mood
swings outta Sylvia,

40:59.566 --> 41:02.534
some being womanly swings
and some being saucey,

41:02.569 --> 41:06.670
swilly swings, but this
particular swing was different.

41:08.740 --> 41:11.136
This swing was off
the playground and
it had me worried.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.910
The love of my life
is in a bad place.

41:15.945 --> 41:19.815
And me without her love,
it puts me in a bad place.

41:20.818 --> 41:23.588
We're connected by our love.

41:23.623 --> 41:26.283
If she crashes, we could
both end up in the junkyard.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.024
And many people just
don't give a damn.

41:31.059 --> 41:33.631
It's mainly true about me.

41:33.666 --> 41:36.964
They could care less if I
had a roof over my head,

41:36.999 --> 41:39.604
food on my table or just anybody

41:39.639 --> 41:41.771
to love me or let
me love 'em back.

41:43.137 --> 41:46.875
To everybody, save
Sylvia, I'm just garbage.

41:52.146 --> 41:53.816
- Yeah. She's resting.

41:56.084 --> 41:59.019
I, I don't know. I'm still
waiting to see the doctor.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.859
Okay. I'll let you know.

42:03.894 --> 42:04.728
Love you.

42:10.131 --> 42:12.835
I wanted to thank you for
taking such good care of my mom.

42:16.808 --> 42:18.038
- It's what I do.

42:22.242 --> 42:26.145
- Listen, she's calm now, but

42:29.315 --> 42:31.018
what happens when the
sedation wears off?

42:32.923 --> 42:34.285
I don't want to have
to cuff her to bed.

42:36.157 --> 42:38.091
- Honestly, what do you
see happening with her?

42:41.767 --> 42:46.363
- Honestly, if she
doesn't quit drinking,

42:48.103 --> 42:52.072
you're looking at
more hospital trips,

42:53.273 --> 42:58.045
more jail time and very
likely an early death.

43:01.281 --> 43:02.786
- Is there anything we can do?

43:04.757 --> 43:06.086
- Can try getting her to rehab.

43:06.990 --> 43:07.989
- How do we do that?

43:14.261 --> 43:15.095
- You wait.

43:19.332 --> 43:20.199
We can't.

43:22.401 --> 43:25.204
You can't make anybody do
anything they don't want to do.

43:27.945 --> 43:30.407
I mean, all the interventions,

43:30.442 --> 43:32.948
all the hospital trips in the
world won't make a difference

43:32.983 --> 43:34.246
unless she wants to get better.

43:36.118 --> 43:37.854
She has to be able to push past

43:37.889 --> 43:39.251
whatever pain
brought her here and

43:41.761 --> 43:42.188
choose to live.

44:06.412 --> 44:07.917
- How's she doing?

44:10.988 --> 44:11.888
- She's gonna be fine.

44:15.861 --> 44:16.728
- Is this family?

44:20.261 --> 44:21.766
- I'll call if
there's any change.

44:32.273 --> 44:33.910
- I heard from a
buddy who's in maintenance

44:33.945 --> 44:34.779
at the hospital.

44:36.310 --> 44:38.145
He said that Sylvia did
start to get better.

44:39.511 --> 44:41.885
She eventually got well
enough to be released.

44:43.152 --> 44:44.822
Did those girls call me?

44:53.525 --> 44:54.931
- Peggy, stop worrying.

44:58.398 --> 44:59.837
I don't know where Gil is.

44:59.872 --> 45:01.498
I hope he drinks
himself to death.

45:01.533 --> 45:04.468
Be the best thing that
ever happened to mom.

45:04.503 --> 45:07.746
- Like it kicked in the
butt by a Budweiser horse.

45:09.112 --> 45:10.947
You can't imagine how low I felt

45:10.982 --> 45:12.883
being diminished
to roach status.

45:14.249 --> 45:17.019
I mean, she was wishing
that I would just die.

45:19.892 --> 45:23.289
Those are the evil thoughts
for sure inside those twins,

45:25.029 --> 45:28.459
but I do need to take
a real look at myself,

45:28.494 --> 45:32.969
try to see those hard truths
that are buried deep within.

45:47.953 --> 45:52.516
Outside my own insecurities,
I do have to ask,

45:52.551 --> 45:55.354
"Would my true love be
better off without me?"

45:56.489 --> 45:58.126
- 'Cause we do wanna
work on your stretching,

45:58.161 --> 45:59.325
just getting in there

45:59.360 --> 46:00.059
just a little bit deeper.
- Yes.

46:00.094 --> 46:01.426
Your hands seem a little tight.

46:01.461 --> 46:02.394
- I agree.

46:02.429 --> 46:04.000
- Yeah.
- I agree.

46:04.035 --> 46:06.332
- Jealousy issues aside,

46:06.367 --> 46:08.972
do I want the best for my love?

46:09.007 --> 46:12.910
Would she be happier with
someone, anyone else?

46:12.945 --> 46:13.537
- Oh, I'll,

46:13.572 --> 46:14.879
I'll be back next week.

46:14.914 --> 46:16.342
I promise.

46:16.377 --> 46:20.984
- Great. Thank you for
calling Studio One Eleven.

46:21.019 --> 46:22.117
This is is Tas speaking.

46:22.152 --> 46:24.988
Are you ready to change your li-

46:25.023 --> 46:27.056
- What kind of name is Tas?

46:39.664 --> 46:41.466
- Hells bells.

46:41.501 --> 46:43.270
- What is it?

46:43.305 --> 46:47.912
- He has played every
sad song on that jukebox.

46:50.609 --> 46:52.378
- He ain't been this
bad since Shirley.

46:53.612 --> 46:56.987
We've all been there
one time or another.

46:57.022 --> 47:00.023
- You know, I thought she was
going to blow up my store.

47:00.058 --> 47:01.024
- You're kidding me?

47:01.059 --> 47:01.453
- I am not.

47:03.061 --> 47:05.963
You know, I think he'd
be much better off

47:05.998 --> 47:07.294
just to leave her be.

47:08.462 --> 47:11.463
- Oh yeah. You're
probably right.

47:11.498 --> 47:12.130
You know, there's
only three things

47:12.166 --> 47:15.170
that a man needs to be happy.

47:15.205 --> 47:18.107
Three of 'em. You wanna
know what they are?

47:18.142 --> 47:19.306
- You're going to tell me.

47:19.341 --> 47:21.308
- Oh yeah. Number one,
your favorite gun.

47:21.343 --> 47:23.442
M16 all day long.

47:23.477 --> 47:26.984
Number two, your favorite car.

47:27.019 --> 47:28.447
1966 GTO 389.

47:29.648 --> 47:31.285
And that third.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.924
- Yeah?

47:32.959 --> 47:36.092
- I can't remember that third.
I done forgot it.

47:36.127 --> 47:37.522
I don't know what it was.
Honey, you take that.

47:37.557 --> 47:39.689
That's cold, but I gotta
get to the tractor.

1:02:27.479 --> 1:02:29.820
The chain across the drive
usually means this is

1:02:29.855 --> 1:02:34.055
a vacation home for trolls,
those living under the bridge,

1:02:34.090 --> 1:02:37.256
meaning the owners are gone.

1:02:50.568 --> 1:02:51.941
Whoa!

1:02:58.444 --> 1:03:00.378
- Hey, you don't get off
this property in 30 seconds

1:03:00.413 --> 1:03:03.414
I'm gon' drop ye
like a bad habit.

1:03:07.090 --> 1:03:08.991
- Uh, crazy braud.

1:03:10.126 --> 1:03:12.225
- I heard that!

1:03:24.470 --> 1:03:28.175
- Hey, Nina,
what in the world

1:03:28.210 --> 1:03:29.308
are you shooting at out here?

1:03:29.343 --> 1:03:31.310
- Claim jumper.

1:03:31.345 --> 1:03:33.576
- Oh, I got, I got $47 in cash.

1:03:33.611 --> 1:03:36.579
I got some canned
goods and I got this.

1:03:36.614 --> 1:03:38.317
I don't know what it is,

1:03:38.352 --> 1:03:40.220
but I'm gonna make a lamp
outta the son of a gun.

1:03:40.255 --> 1:03:41.584
Now come on in the house.

1:03:41.619 --> 1:03:43.256
We got sheets on
the bed in here.

1:03:52.267 --> 1:03:54.531
- Hello? Sylvia, baby?

1:03:56.370 --> 1:03:58.139
- She's in the hospital
again, you piece of crap.

1:03:58.174 --> 1:03:59.569
Because of you.

1:03:59.604 --> 1:04:00.977
- Julie?

1:04:01.012 --> 1:04:02.407
- You know that
ain't possible Gil,

1:04:02.442 --> 1:04:04.079
because you murdered her.

1:04:04.114 --> 1:04:07.676
- Peggy look, I don't know
what happened. Honest.

1:04:07.711 --> 1:04:10.514
- You better hope the
law finds you first, Gil.

1:04:19.624 --> 1:04:20.964
- What a pig's sty.

1:04:23.232 --> 1:04:25.166
- Sir.
- Yeah.

1:04:25.201 --> 1:04:27.234
- The tap we put on
Sylvia's phone paid off.

1:04:28.699 --> 1:04:30.534
The daughter called Gilles
with it and he picked up.

1:04:30.569 --> 1:04:32.173
- We get a trace?

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:35.946
- Partial. We did find paperwork
to another vehicle though.

1:04:35.981 --> 1:04:36.408
He's running.

1:04:38.214 --> 1:04:40.676
Our best guess is he's
headed toward the bridge.

1:04:40.711 --> 1:04:44.053
- We've gotta find those kids
before somebody else gets hurt

1:04:44.088 --> 1:04:45.054
or worse.

1:04:47.718 --> 1:04:51.159
The big question now,
Mr. Harold Gilles,

1:04:52.525 --> 1:04:53.458
do you have any
family in the UP?

1:04:58.135 --> 1:04:59.662
- Don't cry, Gil.

1:04:59.697 --> 1:05:03.369
Don't you dare cry.
Pick that lip up.

1:05:05.010 --> 1:05:09.606
God, help me get through
this and I swear.

1:05:11.214 --> 1:05:12.114
- Careful
now, Harold don't swear

1:05:12.149 --> 1:05:13.280
any promises you can't keep.

1:05:14.646 --> 1:05:19.154
- Dad, is that you?
I didn't say that.

1:05:20.619 --> 1:05:23.125
I thought that.
You're in my head.

1:05:26.427 --> 1:05:28.361
- Well, trauma psychosis,
I'm in your head.

1:05:29.661 --> 1:05:31.298
What're you doing there?

1:05:31.333 --> 1:05:33.003
- You tell me what
I'm doing here.

1:05:33.038 --> 1:05:36.105
- I don't know why you're
here, but while you're here,

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:40.604
I will tell you, I did
not mean to kill you.

1:05:40.639 --> 1:05:42.408
I mean, I did mean
for you to break a leg

1:05:42.443 --> 1:05:43.739
or something like that, but...

1:05:46.744 --> 1:05:50.152
- I know, still it was
a pretty Damien move.

1:05:53.058 --> 1:05:53.991
- I guess, yeah.

1:05:57.392 --> 1:05:59.689
- Come join me, son. A visit.

1:06:00.824 --> 1:06:02.098
Everything depends on it.

1:06:36.431 --> 1:06:37.265
- Is that?

1:06:39.599 --> 1:06:44.239
- When your mother left me,
something inside me just died.

1:06:49.147 --> 1:06:50.746
You deserved so
much more, Harold.

1:06:54.614 --> 1:06:56.119
I just didn't have it to give.

1:07:01.324 --> 1:07:02.587
I am so very sorry.

1:07:09.794 --> 1:07:11.596
- There's no way that
I killed that girl.

1:07:28.450 --> 1:07:30.186
- You hit 'er
pretty hard, didn't ya?

1:07:37.327 --> 1:07:39.591
- Hey.
- What'll you have, my friend?

1:07:39.626 --> 1:07:41.164
- Do you still got
that burger and beer special?

1:07:41.199 --> 1:07:41.626
- Yes, we do.

1:07:43.399 --> 1:07:46.664
- Medium rare and whatever
beer comes with it.

1:07:46.699 --> 1:07:48.600
- Get me the
special, medium rare.

1:07:53.937 --> 1:07:55.541
- Changed a few things up.

1:07:59.778 --> 1:08:03.846

1:08:03.881 --> 1:08:05.353

of swamp tires, buddy

1:08:11.361 --> 1:08:13.757
or you are as
stupid as you look.

1:08:13.792 --> 1:08:15.627
- Now, is that
there supposed to be

1:08:15.662 --> 1:08:19.532
some kind of
compliment or insult?

1:08:19.567 --> 1:08:21.930
What you want,
Ike? What you want?

1:08:25.408 --> 1:08:27.177
Now, the stories of people
actually getting their eye

1:08:27.212 --> 1:08:29.212
punched out is like urban myth,

1:08:29.247 --> 1:08:31.577
kind of like Bruce Lee
pulling out someone's heart,

1:08:31.612 --> 1:08:32.776
but in my case...

1:08:32.811 --> 1:08:33.645
- Yeah!

1:08:37.519 --> 1:08:38.617

1:08:44.757 --> 1:08:46.493

it on Ike Gilles' tab.

1:08:50.961 --> 1:08:52.664

1:09:58.831 --> 1:10:01.601
- My idiot cousin.
I'm gonna kill him.

1:10:02.538 --> 1:10:03.669
I'm gonna kill.

1:10:03.704 --> 1:10:04.802
- You're a Gilles, aren't you?

1:10:06.377 --> 1:10:07.805
- Who wants to know?

1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:10.940
- Gil killed my sister.
We're gonna get him.

1:10:12.482 --> 1:10:14.548
We want your help.

1:10:26.958 --> 1:10:29.024
- Hey, guess who?

1:10:30.632 --> 1:10:32.302
Do you know out
of all the trucks

1:10:32.337 --> 1:10:35.668
that I could have acquired,
guess whose truck I got?

1:10:35.703 --> 1:10:38.605
- Parp's narps, you
stole my truck, buddy!

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:41.410
- Oh, that's not all I stole.

1:10:41.445 --> 1:10:43.973
This here knife sure is a beaut.

1:10:44.008 --> 1:10:46.613
- My momma gave me
that knife, Gil.

1:10:48.353 --> 1:10:51.981
- Oh, and this cherry pie
kush, absolutely delightful.

1:10:56.361 --> 1:10:58.724
- Okay. Game respects game.

1:11:00.090 --> 1:11:02.530
Let's just say we're
even on the rides,

1:11:02.565 --> 1:11:04.697
but you still got an ass
whoopin' coming, buddy.

1:11:05.832 --> 1:11:08.096
- What are you
talking about coming?

1:11:08.131 --> 1:11:11.671
You knocked out my
eye, you nitwit ogre.

1:11:11.706 --> 1:11:13.970
And what are you talking
about even on rides?

1:11:14.005 --> 1:11:17.479
- My new race car
is totally badass.

1:11:19.109 --> 1:11:21.076
You dropped your keys when
you left your eyeball, Gil.

1:11:21.111 --> 1:11:25.850
- Ike, if you take my car I
just might have to kill you.

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:28.017
- What would that
bring your number to?

1:11:28.052 --> 1:11:29.425
What, like three?

1:11:29.460 --> 1:11:30.690
You've been racking
up some kills

1:11:30.725 --> 1:11:32.428
I don't know nothing
about, buddy.

1:11:32.463 --> 1:11:35.431
- Eat crap, Ike and I'm
talking about double servings,

1:11:35.466 --> 1:11:36.960
double servings of
eating crap on you.

1:11:36.995 --> 1:11:38.731
- You eat crap. Crap.

1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.001
- Last time I was
here I was about 14.

1:11:46.708 --> 1:11:47.905
Ike and I had been busting
into troll cottages

1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:50.446
when the law got wise.

1:11:50.481 --> 1:11:53.108
Before that I had hung
here a month after my dad

1:11:53.143 --> 1:11:54.615
caught me stealing from him

1:11:54.650 --> 1:11:56.881
and threatened to
beat me to death.

1:12:02.658 --> 1:12:07.463
- I wasted my time, a haze of
alcoholic rage and depression.

1:12:12.701 --> 1:12:14.767
I could have been had
a teacher for you, son.

1:12:17.101 --> 1:12:19.101
And I caused you to
drop outta school and

1:12:21.677 --> 1:12:23.446
didn't give you
the tools you needed

1:12:23.481 --> 1:12:24.744
in order to succeed in life.

1:12:29.146 --> 1:12:30.783
It's all so clear now.

1:12:33.821 --> 1:12:35.557
You gotta start seeing
your truth, boy.

1:12:42.027 --> 1:12:44.698
Come on, let me
make it up to you.

1:12:44.733 --> 1:12:47.668
- I don't know about that.

1:12:47.703 --> 1:12:48.801
- Come on, Gil.

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:05.521
- It didn't
have to be this way.

1:13:05.556 --> 1:13:08.491
- Sylvia? Sylvia.

1:13:08.526 --> 1:13:09.118
- She can't hear you.
- My baby didn't

1:13:09.153 --> 1:13:09.888
have to be dead.

1:13:11.254 --> 1:13:12.022
- What, is all this
in my head again?

1:13:12.057 --> 1:13:14.530
- No.

1:13:14.565 --> 1:13:15.190
- Is it?

1:13:16.567 --> 1:13:17.192
- There you go again.

1:13:22.705 --> 1:13:24.573
It's all his fault.

1:13:24.608 --> 1:13:27.004
She, she saying it's
my fault? I did it?

1:13:27.039 --> 1:13:31.679
- I told him to leave
her alone.

1:13:32.748 --> 1:13:33.945
- I love you, baby.

1:13:33.980 --> 1:13:35.947
I'm sorry, I, I'm so
sorry, I hear you.

1:13:37.148 --> 1:13:38.851
- Now my baby's dead.

1:13:42.593 --> 1:13:43.988
- This is a taste of truth, son.

1:13:45.629 --> 1:13:48.498
Make you wiser than any
whiskey or beer ever will.

1:13:48.533 --> 1:13:50.192
- Those two girls
always had it in for me.

1:13:50.227 --> 1:13:52.865
- Those two girls only
ever had each other.

1:13:54.198 --> 1:13:56.231
Bond of love born in
heaven that they carried

1:13:56.266 --> 1:13:57.870
into this hard life
they were living.

1:13:59.841 --> 1:14:00.939
- Julie, I'm sorry.

1:14:33.842 --> 1:14:36.073
- I still feel that
connection to my sister.

1:14:37.846 --> 1:14:41.914
I feel her presence
with me, even now here,

1:14:43.049 --> 1:14:45.588
but it's, it's different.

1:14:48.626 --> 1:14:52.188
- Yeah, dead'll make
things different.

1:14:55.028 --> 1:14:55.994
What, buddy?

1:14:57.767 --> 1:14:59.734
- Come on, man.

1:14:59.769 --> 1:15:02.605
- Life doesn't
give participation
awards or trophies.

1:15:04.070 --> 1:15:04.937
There's winners

1:15:07.876 --> 1:15:09.810
and then there's losers.

1:15:09.845 --> 1:15:11.075
- Yeah and obviously you're a-

1:15:11.110 --> 1:15:12.747
- I'm a what?
- Whoa, come on.

1:15:12.782 --> 1:15:13.946
- Oh, let her
finish. I'm a what?

1:15:13.981 --> 1:15:14.881
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:15.618
- No, let her finish. What?

1:15:15.653 --> 1:15:17.081
- Stop. Stop.

1:15:17.116 --> 1:15:19.182
Obviously we're
pretty tired, so-

1:15:19.217 --> 1:15:20.920
- I'm not-

1:15:20.955 --> 1:15:24.319
- I say, I say we down these
eggs and we go and find Gil.

1:15:24.354 --> 1:15:28.664
Can we please do that, please?

1:15:30.866 --> 1:15:32.261
- Yeah.

1:15:32.296 --> 1:15:33.669
- Great.

1:15:33.704 --> 1:15:34.329
- Yeah.

1:15:37.004 --> 1:15:38.201
All right. Geeze.

1:15:42.009 --> 1:15:42.843
- No.

1:16:05.901 --> 1:16:07.131
God, how did I get here?

1:16:09.201 --> 1:16:11.740
I'm just trying
to get by in life.

1:16:13.876 --> 1:16:18.109
You need to tell me,
did I kill that girl?

1:17:09.767 --> 1:17:10.194
Keys.

1:17:12.297 --> 1:17:14.000
- You leaving us already?

1:17:14.035 --> 1:17:17.432
- I don't like Gil one bit,
buddy. Business from as kids.

1:17:19.436 --> 1:17:20.908
We only had one
another growing up

1:17:24.914 --> 1:17:26.210
and then there was Shirley

1:17:30.117 --> 1:17:31.446
and then I knocked his eye out.

1:17:33.252 --> 1:17:35.285
Kind of feel like I owe him
some change on that one.

1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.155
Then he took my
truck without asking,

1:17:40.490 --> 1:17:42.798
but then I got my truck back.

1:17:44.164 --> 1:17:45.328
This here place
is Gil's hide out.

1:17:47.035 --> 1:17:48.738
He knows this area
better than most.

1:17:50.302 --> 1:17:51.807
He's probably got
a stash of guns.

1:17:54.108 --> 1:17:55.272
And like Obi-Wan,

1:17:57.375 --> 1:17:58.407
he's got the high ground.

1:18:02.886 --> 1:18:06.151
And lastly, Gil grew
up immortalizing Rambo.

1:18:08.518 --> 1:18:11.761
So no, I think we're done here.

1:18:11.796 --> 1:18:14.423
- Facing the law
and justice is one thing,

1:18:14.458 --> 1:18:17.767
but these three would likely
kill me if they could.

1:18:19.562 --> 1:18:22.805
- Best place to set a trap for
old Gil is at the local bar.

1:18:24.039 --> 1:18:26.171
If you need anything call me.

1:18:40.891 --> 1:18:43.419
- I think him leaving
might be for the best.

1:18:43.454 --> 1:18:46.026
- What did you bring
for protection?

1:18:46.061 --> 1:18:47.522
- Got a knife.

1:18:47.557 --> 1:18:50.228
- A knife? This
is Gil we're going after.

1:18:53.035 --> 1:18:53.834
- I don't like guns.

1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:57.400
When I was a kid,
my brother hurt me

1:18:57.435 --> 1:18:59.039
pretty bad with a BB gun.

1:19:02.275 --> 1:19:03.472
I mean, he didn't
shoot me or anything,

1:19:03.507 --> 1:19:05.177
he just hit me over
the head with it.

1:19:06.917 --> 1:19:07.542
What'd you bring?

1:19:12.351 --> 1:19:15.154
- Gil! We're
coming for you.

1:20:16.250 --> 1:20:17.150
- Hey, Harold.

1:20:19.616 --> 1:20:20.450
- Dad?

1:20:23.653 --> 1:20:25.994
Again? Am I dying?

1:20:28.163 --> 1:20:30.460
- No. Uh, yeah.

1:20:30.495 --> 1:20:32.935
Well, I mean, all
things born die.

1:20:34.070 --> 1:20:35.432
That's the circle of existence.

1:20:37.667 --> 1:20:40.437
But there is a place of rest
outside the pains of life.

1:20:41.704 --> 1:20:43.077
It's not your time yet, son.

1:20:44.982 --> 1:20:46.916
Allow me to, once again show
you where your actions have

1:20:46.951 --> 1:20:48.247
put other events into motion.

1:20:59.095 --> 1:21:00.556
- I can't stand to
watch her like this.

1:21:03.033 --> 1:21:05.627
I Never felt this much guilt
before in my entire life,

1:21:07.235 --> 1:21:08.531
not even when I killed you.

1:21:12.306 --> 1:21:14.603
- The tormentor becomes a
tormented without redemption

1:21:16.607 --> 1:21:18.508
and that's like drinking poison

1:21:18.543 --> 1:21:20.345
and expecting another
person to die.

1:21:22.184 --> 1:21:25.185
Lies are a slow poison.

1:21:36.198 --> 1:21:38.165
How much one can
endure alone varies.

1:21:39.630 --> 1:21:41.267
The human spirit
needs compassion,

1:21:41.302 --> 1:21:43.632
forgiveness, kindness,
and love to survive.

1:21:43.667 --> 1:21:48.505
Without it, their spirit
to live will surely die.

1:21:56.614 --> 1:21:58.581
- Ike, you can't
do it, you old oaf.

1:21:58.616 --> 1:22:00.385
You're the only family I got.

1:22:14.071 --> 1:22:15.367
- Shut your mouth!

1:24:01.211 --> 1:24:02.804
- Yeah, Mary.

1:24:02.839 --> 1:24:04.773
We're up here in the
middle of nowhere.

1:24:04.808 --> 1:24:08.084
I mean, we gotta get this
guy back there.

1:24:10.253 --> 1:24:10.680
What do you mean?

1:24:13.652 --> 1:24:14.486
Who did it?

1:24:18.228 --> 1:24:19.227
You gotta be kidding me.

1:24:28.304 --> 1:24:28.797
- What'd they say?

1:24:32.638 --> 1:24:33.538
- Sylvia did it.

1:24:34.937 --> 1:24:35.771
- What?

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:38.345
- She killed her own daughter.

1:24:40.613 --> 1:24:42.679
- I didn't kill her.

1:24:44.914 --> 1:24:46.485
S, Sylvia killed her?

1:24:51.492 --> 1:24:53.822
Had that call come
just an hour later

1:24:53.857 --> 1:24:55.824
I would've been a
fugitive on the run again,

1:24:57.399 --> 1:25:01.335
but I just can't believe
that my beloved Sylvia

1:25:01.370 --> 1:25:02.732
killed her own daughter.

1:25:04.802 --> 1:25:09.211
I ended up getting a few years
probation and mandatory AA,

1:25:09.246 --> 1:25:12.544
which I started attending with
my Sylvia at her hospital.

1:25:14.416 --> 1:25:15.910
Together, we were relearning

1:25:15.945 --> 1:25:17.714
how to live without
the drinking.
