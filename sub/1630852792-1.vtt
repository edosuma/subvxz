WEBVTT

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
[Andor] Death

00:52.760 --> 00:55.480
[coughing]

01:00.080 --> 01:01.760
[Andor] Sundering.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.440
The Emperor's Light is the only light.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.680
That which He illuminates, the only path.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.640
[Andor] The harbinger and the fool.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.240
[slams fists]

01:21.320 --> 01:23.600
Which is it, reader? Which am I?

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
Either.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.800
Both.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.680
Turn the last card.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.800
[Andor] The faceless void.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.200
An ignominious end.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.160
Death is coming.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.640
Even now, he waits at your door.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.680
Measure your next steps with care,
Inquisitor.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.960
My thanks, Guious Andor.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.200
You have served the Emperor
as we all must.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.480
This cruel universe
will not remember your name,

02:00.760 --> 02:03.320
but trust that I shall.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.280
[gunshot]

02:19.520 --> 02:21.080
What did he see, lord?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.200
The same as the others.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.200
[foosteps approaching]

02:26.280 --> 02:27.360
Burn it.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.760
Burn everything.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.400
[flames whooshing]

02:38.840 --> 02:39.880
[suspenseful music]

02:50.920 --> 02:52.040
[foosteps fading]

03:03.560 --> 03:06.480
Will there be any Astropaths left
before you're done with this?

03:07.040 --> 03:09.600
There is a fate line somewhere, Si'ana,

03:09.880 --> 03:11.840
one that does not see my end.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.720
I will find it.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.560
Not all futures can be divined.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.000
The ripples of every action
cannot be seen to conclusion.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.760
Can they not? The Aeldari believe so.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.120
You still hold that those xenos
and their witch-seers would help us?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.200
We have an enemy in common.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.440
That has not prompted them
to kindness before.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.080
True enough.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.160
A thought for tomorrow.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.280
Today, we can be certain of this.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.600
If we do not leave for Terra soon,

03:40.680 --> 03:43.160
we shall be late for your investiture.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.600
There is time yet.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.600
They can hardly begin the ceremony
without me.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.640
[electronic beeps]

03:49.880 --> 03:51.920
Inquisitor Arturo has docked.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.160
He's waiting for you
in the receiving chamber...

03:55.960 --> 03:58.080
He's come to escort you to Terra.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.480
Is he alone?

04:01.960 --> 04:04.200
No. He has a retinue of four.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.440
I'll need my effects.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.640
Have Gutter and the others meet us there.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.600
You're expecting trouble?

04:11.440 --> 04:14.480
Wake Turk, and reset his kill count.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.200
[drums beating]

04:26.200 --> 04:28.400
[Kiamoro] Greetings and welcome.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.680
[footsteps approaching]

04:35.280 --> 04:38.440
It is good to see you, my old friend.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.000
[hands bang]

04:40.080 --> 04:41.920
Old friend?

04:42.520 --> 04:43.520
[laughing]

04:44.320 --> 04:48.200
It feels like yesterday
we were wasting our evenings

04:48.280 --> 04:50.320
with amasec and dice.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.200
It was a century ago.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.120
And now you stand
on the precipice of greatness.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.160
Investiture. On Terra, no less.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.840
Bureaucracy comes for us all in the end.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.720
You shouldn't have come.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.280
You knew that someone would.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.920
Eventually.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.040
And the investiture?

05:15.680 --> 05:19.360
Is this just the cover you needed
to board my vessel?

05:19.440 --> 05:22.000
It's as real as anything else.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.280
But what difference does it make?

05:24.840 --> 05:26.400
You know then?

05:26.480 --> 05:28.720
[Arturo]
About your obsession with the Tarot?

05:28.800 --> 05:30.640
[Arturo] About the Aeldari?

05:31.600 --> 05:34.280
Yes. I know.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.120
We almost died at Antioth, Arturo.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.040
The Arch-enemy knew our every move.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.760
We handed them a hundred worlds.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.440
Billions died.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.400
Even with your limited psychic ability,

05:48.480 --> 05:51.440
tell me you cannot still
hear their screams.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.560
There was nothing more we could have done.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.400
But what if we could have?

05:57.760 --> 06:00.800
-What if we knew?
-We are not gods.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.680
We have only the certainty of the moment.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.280
Only the Emperor can divine the future.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.560
And yet He has given us the foresight

06:09.640 --> 06:11.400
to wield such tools as might.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.760
We cannot stack the deck, Kiamoro.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.120
We must play the hand we are dealt.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.280
Very well.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.800
[gunshot]

06:22.880 --> 06:24.800
-No!
-[grunts]

06:26.080 --> 06:27.200
[swords clash]

06:29.120 --> 06:30.160
[grunts]

06:30.640 --> 06:31.920
[suspenseful music]

06:32.000 --> 06:33.120
[gunshot]

06:33.600 --> 06:34.600
[gunshot]

06:34.680 --> 06:36.800
Damn you, Kiamoro!

06:36.880 --> 06:38.040
[sword clashing]

06:40.000 --> 06:42.120
You invite ruin.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.640
[Kiamoro] You come to see it done.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.920
[yells]

06:49.360 --> 06:51.840
[Arturo] Someone must stand in your way!

06:51.920 --> 06:54.200
[swords clashing]

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
[grunting]

06:57.040 --> 06:58.200
[laughs]

06:59.280 --> 07:00.280
[gun blasts]

07:01.560 --> 07:03.440
Must it be you?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.360
[gun blasts]

07:06.440 --> 07:07.600
[gasps]

07:09.200 --> 07:10.400
[yells]

07:13.920 --> 07:15.080
Who else?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.600
[thud]

07:21.400 --> 07:24.040
[Arturo] I wish you'd understood.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.040
[gun blasts]

07:28.120 --> 07:29.240
[explosion]

07:29.520 --> 07:31.000
[screams]

07:31.080 --> 07:32.600
[laughing]

07:35.800 --> 07:37.120
[flames crackling]

07:54.800 --> 07:55.920
[phase hum]

07:56.840 --> 07:58.120
[upbeat music]

07:58.760 --> 08:00.800
[gun shots]

08:02.240 --> 08:04.200
[grunts]

08:06.000 --> 08:09.760
It seems you're not
the face of death today.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.600
[grunts]

08:13.120 --> 08:14.520
[air whirring]

08:23.000 --> 08:24.280
[thuds]

08:24.360 --> 08:25.720
[gun shots]

08:26.200 --> 08:28.600
[yelling]

08:29.160 --> 08:30.680
[slashes]

08:30.760 --> 08:32.600
[screaming]

08:32.680 --> 08:33.760
[gasps]

08:37.360 --> 08:38.400
[gun blasts]

08:38.880 --> 08:40.320
[intense music]

08:42.480 --> 08:44.560
Turk! Now!

08:44.640 --> 08:45.800
[growling]

08:46.600 --> 08:48.080
[slam]

08:50.840 --> 08:52.240
[growling]

08:52.320 --> 08:53.760

09:11.760 --> 09:12.920

09:15.000 --> 09:16.320

09:18.840 --> 09:20.680
[growling]

09:26.480 --> 09:28.160
[blades slashing]

09:29.760 --> 09:31.040
[intense music]

09:33.160 --> 09:34.800
[blood splashing]

09:36.680 --> 09:38.440
Day denounces night!

09:39.680 --> 09:41.080
[beeping]

09:43.920 --> 09:46.040
-[boom]
-[thuds]

09:46.120 --> 09:47.200

09:52.960 --> 09:54.440
[fire crackling]

10:01.600 --> 10:03.200
[footsteps approaching]

10:11.240 --> 10:12.880
What shall I do with her?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.760
Take her to the cell.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.160
[footsteps fading]

10:22.000 --> 10:23.480
[Eerie music]

10:42.360 --> 10:44.720
Who sent you to kill me?

10:47.160 --> 10:49.680
I will not ask again.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.160
[machine whirring]

10:57.640 --> 11:00.200
Cellulor inhibitors.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.080
I wonder...

11:02.160 --> 11:04.600
Am I the first to wear them?

11:04.680 --> 11:06.040
Who?

11:06.120 --> 11:09.040
I did not come here to kill you.

11:09.120 --> 11:12.680
[Kiamoro] This... tells a different story.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.840
[blade stabs]

11:22.680 --> 11:26.440
You cannot break me.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.800
Many have claimed as much before.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.200
[assassin] It is never the many.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.000
It is the single crack

11:35.080 --> 11:37.680
that topples the walls of empires.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.720
I do not fear you, assassin.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.360
You will not leave this chamber alive.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.600
[Kiamoro] Like the hundreds of others
I have interrogated,

11:50.120 --> 11:52.080
[Kiamoro] You will tell me your truths

11:52.360 --> 11:54.880
[Kiamoro] And beg for release in death.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.360
Yes.

11:56.440 --> 12:01.360
Your deeds roll before you
like the smoke of corpse pyres.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.360
You, Inquisitor,

12:04.440 --> 12:07.800
[assassin]
Are by every account a hard man.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
[assassin] A capable man.

12:10.720 --> 12:15.240
A man whose cruelty
is matched only by his arrogance.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.560
But...

12:18.440 --> 12:19.920
the Tarot cards.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.080
[ominous music]

12:25.320 --> 12:27.240
[assassin] You want answers?

12:36.480 --> 12:39.560
[assassin]
For all the hardships you have endured.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.040
[assassin]
For all your training and resolve.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.560
[assassin] For all of your might,

12:46.360 --> 12:48.360
[assassin] Did you ever consider

12:49.120 --> 12:51.840
[assassin]
That, in this universe of horrors,

12:52.640 --> 12:55.240
[assassin] There could be something worse?

12:56.200 --> 12:59.080
[Kiamoro]
You stand unsteadily on that pulpit.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.600
[Kiamoro] I am not an acolyte
or some unbloodied initiate.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.600
[Kiamoro] For almost two hundred years
I have stared down the darkness.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.640
[assassin] Yes...

13:10.720 --> 13:12.120
[assassin] Heretics,

13:12.200 --> 13:13.480
[assassin] Aliens,

13:13.560 --> 13:14.840
[assassin] Daemons...

13:15.200 --> 13:18.120
[assassin] You have faced them all.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.600
[assassin] But what of a child?

13:22.840 --> 13:26.160
[assassin]
What of a child orphaned by war?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.920
[explosions]

13:30.400 --> 13:35.360
[assassin] What if need and instinct
drove that child to kill?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.560
[assassin] To master what they must.

13:46.440 --> 13:52.360
[assassin] What if death was the only
companion the child ever knew?

13:55.200 --> 14:00.120
[assassin] What if this child was plucked
from their world as you were?

14:02.120 --> 14:06.400
[assassin] But instead of the hallowed
halls of the Schola Progenium,

14:07.360 --> 14:11.200
[assassin]
They were taken by far harsher masters?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.120
[drilling]

14:13.680 --> 14:15.160
[jostling]

14:20.520 --> 14:21.880
[machines operating]

14:25.880 --> 14:28.440
[assassin]
What if these monstrous teachers...

14:28.840 --> 14:32.600
[assassin] Cut away whatever
humanity remained in the child

14:34.000 --> 14:37.880
[assassin]
And left behind nothing but a weapon?

14:43.840 --> 14:46.120
[gun shots and screaming]

14:48.440 --> 14:49.600
[Eerie music]

15:01.960 --> 15:05.960
You've spent your life
trying to avoid death,

15:06.680 --> 15:08.960
but its child is here now.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.680
You are a lethal thing.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.480
That fact I do not deny.

15:16.120 --> 15:20.880
But you, like all the rest, have failed.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.280
[assassin] Have I?

15:22.800 --> 15:25.360
[assassin] Then where is your armour?

15:27.880 --> 15:30.040
As I said, Inquisitor,

15:30.560 --> 15:33.440
I did not come here to kill you.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.120
[assassin]
For all that you see and have seen,

15:41.200 --> 15:44.480
[assassin]
You are blind to an obvious truth.

15:44.960 --> 15:49.480
[assassin]
That here, where you seem most in control,

15:50.280 --> 15:53.360
[assassin]
You are also at your most vulnerable.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.840
My mission was simple.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.840
To bring you here.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.560
To have you sit there, across from me.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.520
The famed interrogator
in the chair of his office.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.960
[assassin] Lure.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.760
[assassin] Witness.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.320
[assassin] I came to play both roles.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.840
[assassin] And I did not need to parse
the skeins of fate to do it.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.360
[gunshot]

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
