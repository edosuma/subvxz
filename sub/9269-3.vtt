00:10.413 --> 00:12.332
Branwen!

00:12.741 --> 00:17.820
I condemn thee for exercising wicked
arts in pact with the Devil

00:17.821 --> 00:20.421
by means of incantations
and magic... No!

00:21.661 --> 00:25.460
..of bringing death by Satanic
abominations upon the newborn

00:25.461 --> 00:28.540
of thy neighbour. Lies!
They bear grudge against me!

00:28.541 --> 00:31.581
The sentence for thy foul
maleficium...

00:32.821 --> 00:34.500
death fire!

00:34.501 --> 00:40.740
No! I'm innocent! Mercy,
my Lord! I beg you mercy! Take her.

00:40.741 --> 00:46.541
No! My Lord, I beg mercy! No! No!

00:52.021 --> 00:54.580
Udolf of Pryde, I curse thee

00:54.581 --> 00:59.021
and the male of thy line, that they
be for ever tainted with insanity!

"Having delivered her prophecy,

01:34.341 --> 01:37.620
"was hauled to an agonising
death by fiery torment,

01:37.621 --> 01:42.221
"rendering the male line of the
Prydes for ever accursed."

01:43.741 --> 01:49.180
Riveting. Bravo. Extraordinary
use of language. Chapter two...

01:49.181 --> 01:52.460
Parish business presses, but I'm
looking forward to buying a copy

01:52.461 --> 01:55.100
this afternoon at the Grand Opening.
Oh, thank you!

01:55.101 --> 01:57.460
And I'll show
Miss Diggle to the office

01:57.461 --> 01:59.660
so she can get on with her research.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.461
Thank you so much!
So pleased you like it!

02:19.541 --> 02:23.340
The servants' and tradesmen's
entrance is at the back. I'm neither,

02:23.341 --> 02:27.540
and worthy as the next man to stand
here. The front is for guests,

02:27.541 --> 02:31.780
and you are uninvited.
I explained my position.

02:31.781 --> 02:34.900
I must act in the best
interests of the estate.

02:34.901 --> 02:36.980
These men are your estate!

02:36.981 --> 02:39.580
We open to the public this
afternoon, if you hadn't noticed.

02:39.581 --> 02:42.180
So those you pay meagre wages
to can hand them

02:42.181 --> 02:44.700
back to snoop round your house?

02:44.701 --> 02:48.461
Can I help you?
You can't even help yourselves!

02:49.741 --> 02:51.580
I'm warning you, Pryde,

02:51.581 --> 02:54.541
if you go through with this sale,
I swear you'll pay!

02:56.901 --> 02:58.021
Come on.

03:08.621 --> 03:12.740
Father Brown, how simply miraculous!
I was just on my way to see you.

03:12.741 --> 03:14.420
How simply miraculous.

03:14.421 --> 03:16.341
Hop in!

03:30.381 --> 03:33.380
I'm sorry to disturb,
Miss Diggle. I wondered

03:33.381 --> 03:35.381
if you might like a cup of tea.
No, thank you.

03:50.301 --> 03:53.380
A sporty little number!
An engagement present.

03:53.381 --> 03:55.340
I'm betrothed to the
Marquis of Bingley.

03:55.341 --> 03:58.180
I was just on my way to discuss
banns and other such guff.

03:58.181 --> 04:00.580
Mrs McCarthy's posted
the announcement on the parish

04:00.581 --> 04:05.700
notice board. I hope you'll be very
happy. Yes, of course I will.

04:05.701 --> 04:11.100
Bingo's a sweetheart and frightfully
generous. What do you think, Father?

04:11.101 --> 04:13.701
I think perhaps you should
keep your eyes on the road! Oh, yes!

04:15.341 --> 04:18.380
Do you think I'll make a good
duchess? Do you want to be?

04:18.380 --> 04:20.180
We're not in Catechism class now!

04:20.180 --> 04:22.980
Can't you just tell me the answer
instead of making me work it out?

04:22.981 --> 04:24.141
It's all so exhausting!

04:30.021 --> 04:33.341
I think, if your heart's in
it, you'll make a very good duchess.

04:35.221 --> 04:40.780
If the great unwashed descending
in droves to gawp was not bad enough,

04:40.781 --> 04:45.220
now we have the tenants
rebelling on the doorstep!

04:45.221 --> 04:47.420
They want me to cancel the land sale

04:47.421 --> 04:50.060
while they raise mortgages to
buy their farms.

04:50.061 --> 04:52.260
I told them it's too little,
too late.

04:52.261 --> 04:54.020
We complete at the end of the month.

04:54.021 --> 04:58.900
Your daughter has just landed
the catch of the century,

04:58.901 --> 05:01.900
and you'd announce our penury
from the battlements

05:01.901 --> 05:04.660
before the ring's on her finger?

05:04.661 --> 05:07.901
Our poverty is hardly a secret.

05:09.661 --> 05:15.300
The assumption is that they're
marrying into the landed gentry.

05:15.301 --> 05:18.900
There is no such
thing as a gentleman without land!

05:18.901 --> 05:21.580
The bank has given me a deadline.

05:21.581 --> 05:25.300
Either the sale goes through or
they foreclose on the castle.

05:25.301 --> 05:30.060
Hobson's choice. Lose our land or
would you prefer to lose your home?

05:30.061 --> 05:33.261
This would never have
happened on your father's watch.

05:34.661 --> 05:38.581
Man up, St John! Think of something!

05:41.821 --> 05:45.981
But you ruin that girl's
marriage over my dead body!

05:50.981 --> 05:55.420
So you've heard my news?
It's the talk of the county.

05:55.421 --> 05:58.340
One minute,
you're the donkey in the Nativity,

05:58.341 --> 06:02.060
and the next,
our very own duchess-to-be!

06:02.061 --> 06:05.300
I expect Bishop Talbot will be
officiating?

06:05.301 --> 06:08.260
Oh, no! He's got wet hands
and a face like a fish.

06:08.261 --> 06:10.220
Father Brown's doing the honours.

06:10.221 --> 06:13.740
And I'm counting on you to make
the wedding cake.

06:13.741 --> 06:19.220
Surely not! Such an honour! Finest
cook in the county. WI champion.

06:19.221 --> 06:22.140
Your strawberry
scones are simply legendary!

06:22.141 --> 06:25.500
And everybody knows Daddy's stony
and you're a jolly sight cheaper.

06:25.501 --> 06:27.740
But I meant what
I said about your patisserie skills.

06:27.741 --> 06:29.740
And it'll quite probably
be in the Tatler.

06:29.741 --> 06:32.220
"Cake created by Mrs McCarthy
of Kembleford." And quite

06:32.221 --> 06:36.020
probably a photo, too.
What do you say, Mrs Mac?

06:36.021 --> 06:38.940
"Cake created by Mrs McCarthy
of Kembleford"?

06:38.941 --> 06:40.940
Mm.

06:40.941 --> 06:44.060
Oh, is that the time? Must dash.
But I'll see you at the Opening.

06:44.061 --> 06:45.981
Do pop in for a sherry beforehand.

06:51.181 --> 06:52.221
Oh!

06:56.901 --> 06:59.060
Come on!

06:59.061 --> 07:01.340
Demonstration's starting!

07:01.341 --> 07:03.300
Hold that position.

07:03.301 --> 07:05.180
That's fine there.

07:05.181 --> 07:07.021
That's great. Thank you. Got it.

07:10.421 --> 07:12.060
It'll rot your brains.

07:12.061 --> 07:15.260
Well, if it isn't
the saviour of the family fortune!

07:15.261 --> 07:18.260
Nice try, Cousin, but I'm not asking
Bingo to pour money into this

07:18.261 --> 07:20.020
place just so you can inherit it.

07:20.021 --> 07:22.740
Your offspring will be
of the highest nobility in the land.

07:22.741 --> 07:24.340
Surely Bingo won't expect them

07:24.341 --> 07:26.980
to visit their grandfather
in a cottage?

07:26.981 --> 07:31.340
For goodness' sake, Jago! Are you
trying to blow us all up? It's a dud.

07:31.341 --> 07:34.741
I swapped it with a boy at school.
Audrey?

07:36.061 --> 07:37.980
Audrey?

07:37.981 --> 07:39.900
Where is the wretched woman?

07:39.901 --> 07:43.540
Rehearsing her guided
tour for the hundredth time,

07:43.541 --> 07:45.421
but you haven't seen the best bit.

07:47.261 --> 07:51.740
What on earth are you wearing?
I'm Lady Matilda Pryde,

07:51.741 --> 07:56.300
wife of the fourth Baron
and my direct ancestor.

07:56.301 --> 08:00.740
She thought it would "lend colour to
her guided tour". You may have

08:00.741 --> 08:05.700
been descended from us in the dawn
of time, but now you're an employee.

08:05.701 --> 08:09.660
You're paid not to guide tours
nor to write pamphlets

08:09.661 --> 08:11.700
but to act as my companion!

08:11.701 --> 08:14.660
Diggles is in the doghouse again!
You arrogant boy!

08:14.661 --> 08:16.780
You think you're better than me.
You all do,

08:16.781 --> 08:20.500
when I know for a fact that
none of you has anything to be

08:20.501 --> 08:23.980
superior about. What on earth
are you wittering about?

08:23.981 --> 08:27.060
I'm saying - and prepare
yourself for a shock -

08:27.061 --> 08:30.301
because you aren't who you
think you are!

08:32.660 --> 08:35.260
Father Brown and Mrs McCarthy.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.659
Miss Diggle.

08:36.660 --> 08:40.220
May I say how much I enjoyed
the excerpts from your guide?

08:40.221 --> 08:41.940
And to be left with such
a cliffhanger!

08:41.941 --> 08:46.860
Do we ever find out what the curse
of the Prydes was? No-one knows.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.620
It's just a legend.

08:48.621 --> 08:50.541
Hello, all. Isn't this exciting?

08:52.301 --> 08:54.340
Knights, are you ready?

08:54.341 --> 08:55.381
Draw swords!

08:56.661 --> 08:58.261
..England and St George...

09:00.541 --> 09:04.860
The outer bailey was rebuilt
in the 13th century by the third

09:04.861 --> 09:07.180
Baron, Udolf, who was condemned

09:07.181 --> 09:12.580
and delivered sentence on Branwen,
the witch, who was rushed through

09:12.581 --> 09:17.821
those gates to a pyre prepared
for her outside the castle walls.

09:20.741 --> 09:24.260
As she was hauled to her
execution site, her son,

09:24.261 --> 09:29.100
an archer in Udolf's army,
let fly an arrow from the battlements

09:29.101 --> 09:35.461
and shot his mother in the heart
in a final, merciful act of love!

09:41.381 --> 09:44.461
Where did that come from?
And how on earth did she do that?

09:48.101 --> 09:49.980
Gosh!

09:49.981 --> 09:51.021
Has she been shot?

09:54.181 --> 09:55.220
Hello?

09:55.221 --> 09:56.461
Oh, dear!

10:21.701 --> 10:24.020
Cordon off the scene
and gather the family.

10:24.021 --> 10:27.340
The victim was shot with an arrow
fired from a longbow.

10:27.341 --> 10:29.580
Can't be many of those
around these days, though.

10:29.581 --> 10:33.221
As long as we find the weapon,
should be easy to identify.

10:36.141 --> 10:37.421
Oh, boy!

10:43.981 --> 10:49.221
My mother, Lady Pryde, daughter,
Bunty, and my nephew and ward, Jago.

10:50.901 --> 10:54.901
My condolences on the death
of your cousin. Extremely removed.

10:56.261 --> 10:58.021
What else can you tell me about her?

10:59.061 --> 11:02.340
Well, she was a frightful old
busybody. Enough, Bunty!

11:02.341 --> 11:06.060
That's no way to speak of the dead.
It's true, though.

11:06.061 --> 11:08.300
And, as this is a murder
investigation,

11:08.301 --> 11:11.380
I imagine no detail is too
insignificant for the police.

11:11.381 --> 11:12.900
Quite.

11:12.901 --> 11:13.940
In that case,

11:13.941 --> 11:17.940
she was an immensely irritating
woman, who I wanted to throttle,

11:17.941 --> 11:21.581
but I draw the line at shooting
her through with an arrow.

11:22.661 --> 11:24.900
Do any of you know how to
fire a longbow?

11:24.901 --> 11:28.580
Naturally!
Pryde's a feudal estate, Inspector.

11:28.581 --> 11:30.980
Most people round here can
trace their ancestors back to

11:30.981 --> 11:32.700
Agincourt and beyond.

11:32.701 --> 11:37.540
Can I ask where you all were at the
time of the murder? I went to bed.

11:37.541 --> 11:40.861
And I was in the nursery, listening
to music on the wireless. Me, too.

11:44.221 --> 11:49.460
And you are? Arthur Danby, Sir.
I was in the butler's pantry.

11:49.461 --> 11:50.501
Did anyone see you?

11:52.141 --> 11:58.060
I can't say. But I saw no-one.
I was ten yards in front of Audrey,

11:58.061 --> 12:00.861
which presumably puts me
in the clear.

12:01.901 --> 12:03.341
I see. I don't.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.900
Diggles was a walking,
talking target.

12:07.901 --> 12:11.540
Either the murderer was
an extremely good shot

12:11.541 --> 12:13.620
or else a rather poor one.

12:13.621 --> 12:16.381
Are you suggesting Miss Diggle
wasn't the intended victim?

12:19.221 --> 12:23.580
A minor fracas this morning.
Estate business.

12:23.581 --> 12:28.260
Go on. My uncle was a few feet
away from Audrey.

12:28.261 --> 12:32.061
All I'm saying is maybe
the archer missed his mark.

12:42.821 --> 12:44.861
I say! Can you open that gate,
please?

12:46.941 --> 12:48.061
Open your own gate.

12:49.061 --> 12:52.420
How dare you talk to me like that!
I'll talk to you any way I please.

12:52.421 --> 12:54.821
Who the hell do you think you are?
This is my land.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.061
Not for much longer.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.821
Impudent peasant!

13:13.341 --> 13:15.060
Stop it!

13:15.061 --> 13:17.780
I want the names of all the tenants
demonstrating this morning,

13:17.781 --> 13:19.620
in particular, the name
of the ringleader.

13:19.621 --> 13:23.060
And get that photographer to hand in his
films and get them to the lab immediately.

13:23.061 --> 13:26.420
Good luck with the investigation,
Inspector.

13:26.421 --> 13:27.461
Thank you, Father.

13:28.861 --> 13:32.981
Incidentally, can you think of anyone
who would wish to harm Sir St John?

13:34.421 --> 13:35.900
Just one line of inquiry.

13:35.901 --> 13:39.540
Oh, in that case, Mrs McCarthy is
widely held to be the eyes

13:39.541 --> 13:43.020
and ears of Kembleford.
I don't know about that.

13:43.021 --> 13:45.740
Father Brown will tell you I am
not one to gossip.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.980
Isn't that right, Father? I prefer
to think of it as community wisdom.

13:49.981 --> 13:53.580
Exactly! Community wisdom.

13:53.581 --> 13:57.140
I can't think of anyone who would
want to hurt Sir St John.

13:57.141 --> 13:58.940
Miss Diggle, on the other hand,

13:58.941 --> 14:01.780
was a bit of a busybody,
if you know what I mean.

14:01.781 --> 14:03.900
Said the pot to the kettle.

14:03.901 --> 14:07.820
But a harmless one? No such thing
as a harmless busybody, Inspector.

14:07.821 --> 14:11.181
Yes, that business in the parish
office only this morning...

14:12.301 --> 14:15.540
I don't know what she found,
but it turned her white as a sheet.

14:15.541 --> 14:18.301
Looked as if she'd seen a ghost.
Did she, now?

14:21.901 --> 14:26.180
Miss Diggle... Parish office...
Saw ghost.

14:26.181 --> 14:27.661
Sir. Excuse me.

14:29.541 --> 14:32.980
You don't happen to
notice which register Audrey

14:32.981 --> 14:34.700
was interested in, did you?

14:34.701 --> 14:36.981
1835 to 1855.

14:38.421 --> 14:40.860
Not that I was being nosey,
you understand.

14:40.861 --> 14:42.301
Perish the thought, Mrs M!

14:46.941 --> 14:49.780
I expect you've heard about me
and Bingo, then?

14:49.781 --> 14:51.581
Couldn't you find a man with
a proper name?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.501
Do you like my ring? What does it do?

14:58.301 --> 15:02.020
Do? What is it for?
What's the purpose of it?

15:02.021 --> 15:06.621
It doesn't do anything,
except be beautiful and be admired.

15:08.501 --> 15:11.141
In other words, it's just
a worthless bit of sparkle.

15:17.101 --> 15:21.141
Don't suppose we can do this once
I'm married. Don't suppose we can.

15:23.541 --> 15:27.700
Of course, I could always jilt Bingo
and marry you instead.

15:27.701 --> 15:29.221
An alliance with the enemy?

15:31.461 --> 15:35.261
After I've sworn to annihilate your
class and everything it stands for?

15:39.141 --> 15:40.181
Mrs McCarthy?

15:43.741 --> 15:48.380
Mrs Mc... I heard you first time!
Have you found something?

15:48.381 --> 15:51.300
Either there were no marriages,
births or

15:51.301 --> 15:55.781
deaths in Kembleford between February
and November 1850 or...

15:58.741 --> 16:01.501
we have a missing page.
Holy Mother!

16:06.061 --> 16:07.661
Who would want to kill a busybody?

16:12.061 --> 16:14.821
I fear the answer is
a great many people indeed.

16:19.981 --> 16:21.300
Alan Archer?

16:21.301 --> 16:24.340
I'd like to know your whereabouts
at 3:30 this afternoon.

16:24.341 --> 16:28.060
Audrey Diggle? I'd barely ever
spoken to the woman. Really?

16:28.061 --> 16:31.980
I was here. And before you ask, no,
I don't have an alibi.

16:31.981 --> 16:34.980
And the fracas with
Sir St John this morning?

16:34.981 --> 16:37.861
Not sure of the relevance of the
question. I'll be the judge of that.

16:39.381 --> 16:41.580
He's drowning in death duties,

16:41.581 --> 16:44.060
selling off the estate
for a Government housing scheme,

16:44.061 --> 16:47.420
leaving his tenants of centuries
without land or livelihood.

16:47.421 --> 16:50.460
You're not a tenant, so what's
your interest? I'm their lawyer.

16:50.461 --> 16:52.660
It's funded by the
Socialist Workers Association.

16:52.661 --> 16:55.340
We're helping them raise mortgages
to buy their own land.

16:55.341 --> 16:57.340
Seems reasonable.

16:57.341 --> 16:59.541
Pryde rejected it. And this morning?

17:01.061 --> 17:03.061
He ordered us off his land
and we left.

17:04.421 --> 17:06.540
Is this you? My father.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.300
Did he teach you archery?

17:11.181 --> 17:13.381
I wouldn't be
much of a father if I hadn't.

17:17.701 --> 17:22.101
Mm! Mm! Heavenly, Mrs Mac!
Mm! I'm famished.

17:23.381 --> 17:25.741
We had to let Cook go
and now Nellie's in the kitchen.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.180
Did your mother teach you
how to cook?

17:29.181 --> 17:33.461
Everything I know. She was
the finest cook in County Cork.

17:35.101 --> 17:37.060
Sometimes I wish...

17:37.061 --> 17:39.780
I wish that my mother was around
so that we could

17:39.781 --> 17:41.981
talk about wedding stuff.

17:43.581 --> 17:45.581
All brides get the jitters.

17:48.061 --> 17:50.340
It's not that I don't love Bingo.

17:50.341 --> 17:53.980
It'll be awfully good fun
being a duchess.

17:53.981 --> 17:55.141
It's just...

17:56.221 --> 17:59.141
well, how does one ever know
if it's right?

18:01.061 --> 18:04.780
Just you remember, you are
the luckiest girl in the world

18:04.781 --> 18:07.300
and will be the bride of the year

18:07.301 --> 18:10.421
and your cake will be
the talk of the county.

18:12.061 --> 18:13.101
Ah!

18:14.501 --> 18:19.100
Thank you for a most generous lunch.

18:19.101 --> 18:21.660
You won't be saying
that in the middle of the night.

18:21.661 --> 18:25.261
Nellie's Yorkshire puddings have a
tendency to outstay their welcome.

18:26.861 --> 18:28.820
I understand, when she died,

18:28.821 --> 18:31.781
poor Miss Diggle was researching
another project.

18:33.461 --> 18:38.220
She took it upon herself to write
a history of the Prydes.

18:38.221 --> 18:43.900
Fascinating as our family is,
I doubt Audrey's tome would appeal.

18:43.901 --> 18:49.660
She did have a rather florid style.
The woman was obsessed. Paranoid!

18:49.661 --> 18:52.740
Claimed people had been
reading her papers.

18:52.741 --> 18:54.301
Look who I found on the doorstep!

18:55.701 --> 18:59.421
I'd like a word with Sir St John
and Lady Pryde, please. In private.

19:02.341 --> 19:06.660
Father Brown is our trusted
spiritual advisor.

19:06.661 --> 19:08.061
We have nothing to hide.

19:09.621 --> 19:12.820
It seems there's a widely held
belief on the estate

19:12.821 --> 19:17.700
that Sir St John and your butler
are related.

19:17.701 --> 19:20.180
We share a grandfather.
What of it?

19:20.181 --> 19:24.060
There's no secret Danby's father
was the youthful

19:24.061 --> 19:28.100
indiscretion of the tenth Baron
after a fumble with the housemaid.

19:28.101 --> 19:31.220
It seems paradoxical to find first
cousins in the role of master

19:31.221 --> 19:33.420
and servant
because of an accident of birth.

19:33.421 --> 19:36.540
Actually, the aristocracy have a long
tradition of giving preferment

19:36.541 --> 19:38.380
to their by-blows.

19:38.381 --> 19:39.421
Quite.

19:40.781 --> 19:44.260
The woman died in childbirth.
What were they supposed to do?

19:44.261 --> 19:47.060
Cast the infant into the workhouse?

19:47.061 --> 19:49.940
Danby's father was
adopted by a footman.

19:49.941 --> 19:51.860
He worked his way through
the servant's hall

19:51.861 --> 19:53.340
until he became butler,

19:53.341 --> 19:56.141
as did Arthur after him.
But not his son.

19:58.021 --> 19:59.381
Butterfingers!

20:00.581 --> 20:05.380
Alan Archer is the prime example
of the folly of Rab Butler in trying

20:05.381 --> 20:07.300
to educate the lower classes.

20:07.301 --> 20:10.740
He was permitted to march off to
a left-wing university,

20:10.741 --> 20:14.140
from which he returned with
ideas above his station.

20:14.141 --> 20:16.700
The question is,

20:16.701 --> 20:20.220
does he hate the ruling classes
enough to kill for his beliefs?

20:20.221 --> 20:21.700
Don't be odious, Jago!

20:21.701 --> 20:24.780
The murderer probably meant to kill
Audrey, for all we know.

20:24.781 --> 20:29.980
Bunty's right. We are forgetting
Audrey. I've forgotten nothing.

20:29.981 --> 20:34.580
She writing a family history.
Codswallop, more like!

20:34.581 --> 20:36.100
You're welcome to it.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.580
Thank you, but I find the present
more relevant than

20:38.581 --> 20:39.901
the past at this stage.

20:44.581 --> 20:48.940
I can't understand why you're
interested in Audrey's dreary book.

20:48.941 --> 20:50.740
I wonder, as you were
so close to her heart,

20:50.741 --> 20:54.260
whether it would be apt to include
an extract in her eulogy.

20:54.261 --> 20:57.260
You might rethink when
you've read it.

20:57.261 --> 20:58.900
'Can you lend me five guineas?

20:58.901 --> 21:00.540
'Why on earth would I lend you
money?'

21:00.541 --> 21:04.620
Because you're going to be the
fourth richest woman in the land.

21:04.621 --> 21:07.980
And if you don't, I'll tell
the inspector that you were with

21:07.981 --> 21:10.700
the butler's son when you said you
were in the nursery.

21:10.701 --> 21:12.020
'You wouldn't dare!'

21:12.021 --> 21:13.900
Can I fetch something...

21:13.901 --> 21:14.940
'Why not?'

21:14.941 --> 21:16.100
..something to drink?

21:16.101 --> 21:19.700
Just a touch of heat stroke.
Excuse me.

21:19.701 --> 21:21.100
'My wedding to
Bingo would be off

21:21.101 --> 21:23.461
'and you'd never see
a whiff of his money.'

21:25.061 --> 21:26.461
And I'd have to kill you.

21:52.741 --> 21:56.101
I trust I'm not interrupting
work on next Sunday's homily?

21:57.381 --> 21:59.900
History of the Pryde family.

21:59.901 --> 22:03.820
Illustrious but bloody,
full of violent deaths

22:03.821 --> 22:07.460
and strange disappearances.
Is Mrs Clackett ill?

22:07.461 --> 22:09.860
Oh, she'll be in tomorrow as usual,

22:09.861 --> 22:13.581
and she won't be finding a godly
man in unclean surroundings.

22:14.661 --> 22:16.820
Well, go on.

22:16.821 --> 22:20.380
Lots of family members who
disappear from their annals

22:20.381 --> 22:24.301
and then reappear, marked simply
"deceased".

22:25.621 --> 22:28.221
And all male. Branwen's curse?

22:29.421 --> 22:33.500
Destined never to die
peacefully in their beds.

22:33.501 --> 22:36.061
Does this shed any
light on our missing page?

22:37.901 --> 22:41.500
When Audrey died, she was
researching St John's grandfather,

22:41.501 --> 22:45.420
Ralph Pryde, 1829-1901.

22:45.421 --> 22:50.461
So in 1850, he would have been...
21. Exactly!

22:51.461 --> 22:55.260
Were there any births, marriages or
deaths in the family that year?

22:55.261 --> 22:56.301
Not one.

22:57.981 --> 23:02.620
Well, tomorrow's Monday, so no doubt
all will become clear then.

23:02.621 --> 23:03.661
Feet, Father!

23:04.861 --> 23:05.901
Will it?

23:07.101 --> 23:11.180
When you go to the
Diocesan Records Office. Do I?

23:11.181 --> 23:14.541
Where we keep
copies of the parochial registers!

23:17.941 --> 23:20.381
Angel and saint
rolled into one, Mrs M!

24:21.581 --> 24:24.181
Morning, Father.
Thank you for coming.

24:26.341 --> 24:30.100
I hear he had a lucky escape.
Luckier than you know.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.860
He was pulled from the pool
with a lethal

24:31.861 --> 24:34.500
dose of barbiturates in his system.

24:34.501 --> 24:35.540
If he hadn't spewed them

24:35.541 --> 24:38.380
out, along with a stomach
full of water, he'd be dead.

24:38.381 --> 24:39.701
How were they administered?

24:41.061 --> 24:45.500
Jago has a habit of filching whisky
when our backs are turned.

24:45.501 --> 24:47.581
Traces of drugs were
found in his hip flask.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.741
Who would want to kill a child?

24:52.981 --> 24:54.140
You have no evidence.

24:54.141 --> 24:56.580
Your well-documented hatred
of the Prydes,

24:56.581 --> 24:58.980
the imminent completion
of the land sale,

24:58.981 --> 25:02.100
the threat you
made on the day of the murder,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.621
your father a county archery
champion.

25:05.821 --> 25:09.140
A chip off the old block, I bet.
He taught me to shoot.

25:09.141 --> 25:15.340
He taught all of us, Jago and
the girl included. Ah, yes! Jago.

25:15.341 --> 25:18.420
I suppose you heard what
happened yesterday?

25:18.421 --> 25:20.461
I heard he had a swimming accident.

25:21.941 --> 25:23.661
We believe it was attempted murder.

25:25.421 --> 25:28.980
You think I fight with children?

25:28.981 --> 25:31.340
With Jago dead,
Pryde is without male heir

25:31.341 --> 25:34.700
and the estate passes to
an eighth cousin in Canada.

25:34.701 --> 25:39.341
I think, when your attempt failed on
Sir St John, you went after his pup.

25:40.861 --> 25:43.060
This is all circumstantial.

25:43.061 --> 25:44.101
Hm.

25:48.781 --> 25:53.420
This isn't.
Taken 15 minutes before the murder.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.580
So I await your convincing
explanation as to why you

25:56.581 --> 25:58.181
lied as to your whereabouts.

25:59.781 --> 26:00.821
No comment.

26:08.341 --> 26:11.620
Where are you off to in such
a hurry? To see the police.

26:11.621 --> 26:15.740
Alan Archer's been arrested. So I
heard. And I can't say I'm surprised.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.660
A young man with a lot of anger in
him, by all accounts. It's not anger.

26:18.661 --> 26:22.780
It's passion. And he didn't kill
Audrey. What makes you so sure?

26:22.781 --> 26:25.260
Because he was with me.
We'd just met in the walled garden

26:25.261 --> 26:27.260
when we heard all the screaming
and commotion.

26:27.261 --> 26:30.700
Oh, sweet baby Jesus!
Look, it's not what you think.

26:30.701 --> 26:32.580
Or rather, it IS what you think.

26:32.581 --> 26:34.900
Oh, but I do like him awfully,
Mrs Mac.

26:34.901 --> 26:37.980
And he must like me, too, or he would
have told the police he had an alibi.

26:37.981 --> 26:40.540
But it would never work, child.

26:40.541 --> 26:44.500
Yes, that's what he says. At least
one of you has got some sense.

26:44.501 --> 26:48.700
And though it's a sin, a visit to the
confessional and a few Hail Marys -

26:48.701 --> 26:53.180
well, a few DOZEN Hail Marys -
and you'll be as right as rain

26:53.181 --> 26:56.141
and you can forget
about the likes of Alan Archer.

26:58.021 --> 27:02.540
Do you really think so, Mrs Mac?
Just youthful indiscretion.

27:02.541 --> 27:08.060
Put it behind you. Marry your
marquis and live happily ever after.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.141
Thank you, Mrs Mac.

27:23.621 --> 27:26.380
I popped in to see the invalid
and Danby said I'd find you in here.

27:26.381 --> 27:27.821
What are you up to, Father?

27:30.301 --> 27:32.980
I was wondering what happened to
Jago's father.

27:32.981 --> 27:36.820
Mm. Simon and his wife died in a car
crash in France.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.900
Poor little chap was only
six weeks old.

27:39.901 --> 27:41.500
France?

27:41.501 --> 27:43.340
Close enough to have the body
repatriated,

27:43.341 --> 27:46.140
yet conspicuous by his absence
in the family tomb.

27:46.141 --> 27:48.860
I thought it was odd at the time,
but then there were

27:48.861 --> 27:50.460
the rumours about his job.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.940
Something in the Government.
Terribly hush-hush. Is it important?

27:53.941 --> 27:56.420
I sense the key to this crime
is in the past.

27:56.421 --> 27:59.940
Well, then I'll telephone Monty.
He's sitting in the Lords this week.

27:59.941 --> 28:03.540
Plenty of right ears
he can pop a word in. Thank you.

28:03.541 --> 28:07.220
And now, I must away or
I'll miss my train to Gloucester.

28:07.221 --> 28:10.221
Oh! Are you going to see Bishop
Talbot? Not if I can help it.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.461
Why didn't you tell the police
you were with me?

28:19.501 --> 28:21.221
Why do you think? I don't know.

28:22.661 --> 28:26.580
Well, I hope it's
because you care about me

28:26.581 --> 28:30.380
and you don't want to ruin
my reputation. YOUR reputation?

28:30.381 --> 28:31.980
The arrogance of your class!

28:31.981 --> 28:34.340
You think I want it known that
I've been consorting with

28:34.341 --> 28:36.180
the likes of you?

28:36.181 --> 28:40.380
Well, good, because all consorting
between us is over!

28:40.381 --> 28:41.740
I'm going to marry Bingo and you

28:41.741 --> 28:44.421
and I will never see or speak
to each other again!

28:49.261 --> 28:50.301
Father Brown?

28:51.421 --> 28:55.660
I'm glad I caught you. I just
got off the phone from Monty.

28:55.661 --> 29:01.100
He found out what happened to Simon
Pryde. I hope you're sitting down.

29:01.101 --> 29:03.541
It gets rather
unpleasant from here on in.

29:05.381 --> 29:10.540
Thank you for gathering everyone
together. We're all keen to know why.

29:10.541 --> 29:16.220
To hear the truth, which involves you
all. Your son, Simon.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.700
Absent from the family tomb.

29:18.701 --> 29:21.381
He died abroad.
But not in a car crash.

29:23.021 --> 29:27.580
I've been informed that Simon's
body wasn't repatriated

29:27.581 --> 29:31.220
because a Government department
appropriated it.

29:31.221 --> 29:32.821
What's this got to do with Audrey?

29:34.461 --> 29:37.980
Does Jago know the truth?
This is none of your damn business!

29:37.981 --> 29:40.821
That's enough, St John!
It's too late now.

29:42.101 --> 29:44.660
Jago's a child.

29:44.661 --> 29:48.461
Do you think we'd want to burden him
with the knowledge...

29:51.021 --> 29:52.141
that his father...

29:54.061 --> 29:59.301
slashed his mother's throat before
blowing his own brains out? Daddy?

30:00.861 --> 30:05.100
Simon was MI6.
It was all handled very discreetly.

30:05.101 --> 30:06.901
We never knew what
happened to the bodies.

30:08.101 --> 30:12.300
The curse of the Prydes.
It's a legend.

30:12.301 --> 30:17.940
All legends have some truth,
and your family has spent centuries

30:17.941 --> 30:21.260
covering up the curse
of hereditary insanity.

30:21.261 --> 30:24.380
Everybody knows the Prydes
are as mad as a box of frogs.

30:24.381 --> 30:27.700
Are you seriously suggesting that
Audrey was murdered

30:27.701 --> 30:31.180
because she'd uncovered some
imaginary curse?

30:31.181 --> 30:34.500
I'm suggesting the curse is
the reason why you attempted to

30:34.501 --> 30:35.821
murder your grandson.

30:38.261 --> 30:39.940
'Why on earth would
I lend you money?'

30:39.941 --> 30:42.661
Because you're going to be the
fourth richest woman in the land.

30:44.101 --> 30:47.180
And if you don't, I'll tell
the inspector that you were with

30:47.181 --> 30:49.501
the butler's son when you said you
were in the nursery.

30:51.901 --> 30:54.860
It wasn't the shock of Bunty's
love affair.

30:54.861 --> 30:57.300
It was the knowledge that Jago
didn't have an alibi.

30:57.301 --> 30:59.900
How dare you insult Mummy like this!

30:59.901 --> 31:02.780
I insist you leave this castle
immediately!

31:02.781 --> 31:04.141
Who would want to kill a child?

31:06.061 --> 31:07.661
Someone who loves him the most...

31:08.741 --> 31:12.661
like Udolf's archer, who shot his
mother to spare her torment.

31:13.781 --> 31:17.221
Branwen's torment would have been
relatively short-lived.

31:18.221 --> 31:21.900
But Jago's would have lasted
a lifetime,

31:21.901 --> 31:24.460
incarcerated with lunatics.

31:24.461 --> 31:29.820
Preposterous!
Oh, do be quiet, St John!

31:29.821 --> 31:33.060
What choice did
I have after what the boy did?

31:33.061 --> 31:35.820
Will somebody please tell me
what you're all talking about?

31:35.821 --> 31:39.061
I'm so sorry,
but it was Jago who killed Audrey.

31:50.781 --> 31:54.981
In a final, merciful act
of love.

31:57.621 --> 32:00.380
What possible reason could...

32:00.381 --> 32:01.981
He was your brother's son!

32:03.421 --> 32:07.861
You, of all people, should know
that he didn't need a reason.

32:12.741 --> 32:14.740
From the moment of Simon's birth,

32:14.741 --> 32:17.180
I knew that there was something
missing.

32:17.181 --> 32:20.021
An emptiness.
Call it a curse, if you like.

32:22.781 --> 32:26.781
When he did what he did,
it was almost predictable.

32:30.181 --> 32:33.981
And after, when Jago came to us...

32:35.981 --> 32:38.541
..I saw, in an instant,
he was the same.

32:43.181 --> 32:46.941
He didn't need a reason to
kill Audrey.

32:50.501 --> 32:54.020
For all I know,
she may have beat him

32:54.021 --> 32:56.901
at chess or taken the last
scone at tea.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.981
He did have a reason. What reason?

33:01.301 --> 33:04.781
Well, why don't you ask him yourself?
You can come out now, Jago.

33:06.261 --> 33:08.340
Oh, no. Be my guest, Father.

33:08.341 --> 33:10.461
I wouldn't want to
spoil your moment of triumph.

33:12.261 --> 33:16.020
Audrey found record of a secret
marriage between Ralph Pryde

33:16.021 --> 33:19.501
and Violet Archer three
months before she died in childbirth.

33:21.621 --> 33:25.100
Your father wasn't born the wrong
side of the blanket.

33:25.101 --> 33:27.021
He was the Pryde's legitimate heir.

33:28.981 --> 33:30.980
That's ridiculous!

33:30.981 --> 33:33.380
The priest that married them
would have said something.

33:33.381 --> 33:38.660
Father Dominic Gleave,
buried August 28th, 1850,

33:38.661 --> 33:40.660
ten days after the wedding.

33:40.661 --> 33:43.820
Poor old Diggers!
I was winding her up,

33:43.821 --> 33:47.860
spooking her by messing up
her stuff,

33:47.861 --> 33:49.260
and then she found a letter

33:49.261 --> 33:52.420
to my great-grandfather from some
housemaid

33:52.421 --> 33:56.100
and went rummaging through all
the records. She wasn't exactly

33:56.101 --> 33:58.461
subtle about it. Neither were you.

33:59.501 --> 34:01.220
You left whisky on the desk

34:01.221 --> 34:03.861
when you tore the page
out of the parish register.

34:04.901 --> 34:07.501
That was careless.
You didn't kill her, Jago?

34:08.621 --> 34:12.340
What did you expect me to do?
I did it for you, too, Cuz.

34:12.341 --> 34:15.221
That piece of paper makes
all of us nobodies.

34:16.741 --> 34:18.100
So now all that's cleared up,

34:18.101 --> 34:20.860
will you please all line up,
facing the wall?

34:20.860 --> 34:23.460
I'm ordering you, boy!
Put down that bow!

34:23.460 --> 34:24.501
Quiet!

34:26.501 --> 34:28.101
Face the wall! Turn around!

34:34.900 --> 34:37.900
Get down! No, no, no!
Don't worry. It's a dud.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.741
Thanks be to God.

34:47.301 --> 34:48.541
Just to be on the safe side...

34:54.661 --> 34:55.900
Jago!

34:55.900 --> 34:57.101
Jago!

35:10.101 --> 35:13.621
I thought you'd be here. The murderer
returns to the scene of the crime.

35:15.501 --> 35:19.661
The master tactician withdraws to
a height more easily defended.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.621
I'll pick them off, one by one.
It's over, Jago.

35:25.781 --> 35:28.140
The police are on their way.
It was all Diggles's fault.

35:28.141 --> 35:30.940
She shouldn't have been so nosey.
And now here am I,

35:30.941 --> 35:34.421
between Scylla and Charybdis!
Incarceration or death!

35:35.941 --> 35:39.940
On balance, suicide would be
the more honourable way out.

35:39.941 --> 35:43.580
Not in God's eyes.
I don't believe in a supreme being.

35:43.581 --> 35:47.140
The only god my family worships is
the god of pride.

35:47.141 --> 35:50.981
And I'm sure Granny would approve,
especially as she tried to kill me.

35:52.221 --> 35:55.700
She had me there.
My money was on Bunty.

35:55.701 --> 35:57.501
Take one more step and I'll jump!

35:59.861 --> 36:03.620
I'm sorry you heard
about your parents like that.

36:03.621 --> 36:04.660
Oh, I don't know.

36:04.661 --> 36:09.100
I'd rather my father was a spy
than a careless driver,

36:09.101 --> 36:10.741
even if he did kill my mother.

36:12.861 --> 36:17.541
Remind me, Father. What are the
rules on lunatics and Hell?

36:20.981 --> 36:23.660
Maybe the decision has been
made for me.

36:23.661 --> 36:24.861
Don't let go!

36:26.461 --> 36:28.540
How do you know
I won't pull you down with me?

36:28.541 --> 36:31.741
I'll take my chance,
and I'm not alone.

36:32.741 --> 36:37.020
Buddha says the secret of existence
is to have no fear.

36:37.021 --> 36:38.940
Never fear what will become of you.

36:38.941 --> 36:42.541
Only the moment you reject all
help are you freed.

37:02.381 --> 37:04.901
I'll soon know
if there's a hell or not.

37:06.701 --> 37:08.501
Hell is only the absence of God.

37:10.941 --> 37:16.101
If you repent and accept Him,
there will only be bliss for ever.

37:17.821 --> 37:18.901
It sounds nice.

37:22.381 --> 37:23.901
It's yours for the asking.

37:32.461 --> 37:34.380
Bunty! Bunty!

37:34.381 --> 37:35.421
Quick! Quick!

37:37.861 --> 37:38.901
Requiem...

37:43.941 --> 37:47.060
Requiescat in pace.

37:47.061 --> 37:49.421
Amen.

37:51.501 --> 37:53.380
If Jago killed Miss Diggle,
then who was

37:53.381 --> 37:55.981
responsible for the attempt
on his life?

38:00.741 --> 38:05.980
Perhaps he took them himself
to avert suspicion. Is that likely?

38:05.981 --> 38:07.620
I wouldn't have put it past him.

38:07.621 --> 38:09.661
Yes, it's just the sort of thing
Jago would do.

38:13.701 --> 38:14.861
I'll see myself out.

38:20.981 --> 38:23.260
Well, I'd better telephone Bingo.

38:23.261 --> 38:24.781
I doubt there'll be a wedding now.

38:25.821 --> 38:29.340
Would you like me to serve tea?
Don't be ridiculous!

38:29.341 --> 38:32.580
This is your house now, isn't it?
You think we want any of this?

38:32.581 --> 38:36.500
What is it you always say? You don't
choose what class you're born into?

38:36.501 --> 38:40.341
Words spoken by some priest a century
ago doesn't make me one of you!

38:42.381 --> 38:48.220
Don't you see? There is no them
and us! The War changed that.

38:48.221 --> 38:53.060
High and low, shoulder to shoulder,
as brave or scared as the next man.

38:53.061 --> 38:56.420
All your talk of breaking down the
class divide whilst you build

38:56.421 --> 38:58.140
up your own walls!

38:58.141 --> 39:02.221
You're a fool, boy,
for all your fancy education!

39:08.141 --> 39:09.261
What a bloody mess!

39:10.901 --> 39:13.180
By rights, I should be devastated.

39:13.181 --> 39:16.621
Instead, all I feel is a weight
lifted from my shoulders.

39:18.101 --> 39:22.901
What are we going to do? God knows!
I won't contest it.

39:24.021 --> 39:27.380
What if I don't want it?
I'm afraid it's yours,

39:27.381 --> 39:28.941
whether you want it or not.

39:50.861 --> 39:53.461
Jago died in the light of God.
Of that I am certain.

39:55.461 --> 39:56.501
Thank you, Father.

39:59.301 --> 40:01.021
Time to face the music, I think.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.821
What end would confessing
serve, Lavinia?

40:05.821 --> 40:08.300
Are you saying
I shouldn't be held to justice?

40:08.301 --> 40:09.461
I'm saying no such thing.

40:14.141 --> 40:15.181
Very well.

40:18.461 --> 40:20.381
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

40:23.261 --> 40:27.381
It is decades since I made my last,
honest confession.

40:28.901 --> 40:32.260
In addition to the attempted
murder of my own flesh and blood,

40:32.261 --> 40:37.541
I am guilty of many things,
including the sin of pride.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.501
I fear this may take some time.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.301
Take as much time as you need.

40:55.421 --> 40:56.461
I'm so sorry.

40:59.221 --> 41:03.580
Poor Jago. And Daddy. And...

41:03.581 --> 41:05.501
And I've just
been on the telephone to Bingo.

41:06.981 --> 41:09.541
Some things just aren't meant to be.
Thanks.

41:13.261 --> 41:16.300
You don't understand.
Bingo was a total gent.

41:16.301 --> 41:18.780
Said he couldn't give
a fig for scandal or my family

41:18.781 --> 41:21.900
and that he'll marry me
if he damn well pleases, and

41:21.901 --> 41:26.060
that if his father cuts him off,
then so be it, although that would

41:26.061 --> 41:28.341
probably involve
an Act of Parliament.

41:29.781 --> 41:31.620
And now I don't know what to think.

41:31.621 --> 41:34.701
I think your marquis
sounds like a very fine young man.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.461
Not a nasty bone in his body.

41:40.821 --> 41:46.700
And if as fine and as handsome and
as rich a man loves you that much,

41:46.701 --> 41:51.221
and you're stood here crying your
eyes out, then that's your answer.

41:53.021 --> 41:56.781
Don't let pride stand in your way.
Go to him.

41:59.301 --> 42:00.541
You're right, Mrs Mac.

42:13.861 --> 42:15.500
Not quite what I meant!

42:15.501 --> 42:18.620
You are an arrogant, fat-headed pig,
Alan Archer,

42:18.621 --> 42:20.340
and an inverted snob to boot!

42:20.341 --> 42:23.340
And it serves you damn well right
you're going to inherit a title!

42:23.341 --> 42:25.221
"Sir" Alan Pryde. How do you like...

42:38.261 --> 42:42.620
Daddy and Danby - I mean Arthur -
are being frightfully civilised.

42:42.621 --> 42:45.420
The land's being sold to the tenants
to pay off the death duties

42:45.421 --> 42:48.300
and the castle's being handed
over to the National Trust, who'll

42:48.301 --> 42:50.501
let them
stay on as sort of caretakers.

42:51.981 --> 42:54.860
And even Granny seems to be somehow
more at peace with herself,

42:54.861 --> 42:58.740
but only when she thinks we aren't
looking. Is it moist enough?

42:58.741 --> 43:00.740
Scrumptious!

43:00.741 --> 43:04.740
15 pounds of royal icing,
20 pounds of marzipan

43:04.741 --> 43:06.420
and six tiers.

43:06.421 --> 43:08.460
I don't know if I mentioned it...

43:08.461 --> 43:11.341
That happens to be one more than
Princess Elizabeth's!

43:17.061 --> 43:18.101
How are you?

43:22.461 --> 43:27.621
Outstanding work, Mrs McCarthy.
Outstanding!
