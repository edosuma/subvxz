05:31.680 --> 05:35.127
December, 1944.

05:35.296 --> 05:39.125
British and American armies
were on the threshold of victory.

05:39.296 --> 05:42.330
Stretched across half of Europe,
the Allies gathered themselves...

05:42.497 --> 05:45.213
...for the final assault on Germany.

05:45.377 --> 05:47.711
To the north
stood Montgomery's Eighth Army...

05:47.872 --> 05:50.239
...to the south, Patton's Third.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.986
In the center, along an 88-mile front...

05:53.153 --> 05:58.172
...a few battle-weary American divisions
rested in a quiet sector.

05:58.721 --> 06:02.267
To them, the war seemed already won.

06:02.497 --> 06:05.116
This is their story.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.289
We've been flying over these woods
all week.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.400
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.

06:09.569 --> 06:13.050
- Getting hungry, Joe?
- The war is over.

06:13.218 --> 06:16.447
I hear GHQ is cutting orders
to ship us home for Christmas.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.458
The German army still has
6 million men carrying arms.

06:19.617 --> 06:22.367
I haven't heard they're going home
for Christmas.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.750
Hey, there it is...

06:27.362 --> 06:29.567
...the German army.

06:30.755 --> 06:32.893
Let's go down and have a look.

06:38.050 --> 06:41.280
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.
- Okay.

07:41.733 --> 07:44.766
This time, gun your engine.
Make him look up.

08:04.774 --> 08:06.367
It worked.

08:06.822 --> 08:08.895
Swing around.
I wanna get another one.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.262
Conrad.

08:49.192 --> 08:51.297
I am ashamed of you.

08:51.688 --> 08:53.095
Get up.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.816
They could have killed us, sir.

08:59.977 --> 09:02.694
If you'd taken the pains
to have looked carefully...

09:02.858 --> 09:06.502
...you would have observed it was
an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

09:06.665 --> 09:10.691
You would stay in the car if it were
a fighter plane shooting at us.

09:11.082 --> 09:14.430
I did not lose a war to die
in the back seat of a car.

09:14.633 --> 09:18.495
Does the colonel think any of us
has a choice where we will die?

09:18.665 --> 09:23.041
I know where you'll die, Conrad,
at home, in your own bed.

09:23.210 --> 09:26.177
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

09:26.634 --> 09:31.653
I think that the world is going
to get rid of both of us.

09:32.521 --> 09:35.042
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

09:35.210 --> 09:37.698
Try to look like a soldier!

09:38.538 --> 09:40.774
What good is a soldier anyhow?

09:40.939 --> 09:43.077
He wins, he loses.

09:43.242 --> 09:45.631
What's he good for anyhow?

09:45.835 --> 09:48.322
Conrad, I've told you before...

09:48.490 --> 09:51.338
...never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.

09:51.499 --> 09:52.808
I'm sorry, sir.

09:52.971 --> 09:54.978
It won't happen again.

10:10.027 --> 10:14.184
Looks like something on the ground
at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.587
Nothing.

10:24.748 --> 10:26.658
Let's go home.

11:24.175 --> 11:26.248
Herr Oberst Hessler is here.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.564
- Colonel Hessler, sir.
- Yes.

12:13.617 --> 12:15.689
Well, Hessler.

12:16.273 --> 12:18.062
It has been a long time.

12:18.225 --> 12:20.461
How good it is to see you again.

12:20.913 --> 12:22.768
You look the same.

12:22.929 --> 12:24.041
Little...

12:24.241 --> 12:25.485
Little leaner perhaps.

12:26.673 --> 12:30.350
The Russian front does not put meat
on a man's bones, general.

12:30.514 --> 12:34.092
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

12:34.929 --> 12:37.263
- Central heating.
- Yeah.

12:37.426 --> 12:39.847
Crystal chandeliers.

12:40.305 --> 12:42.030
You have a nice cellar.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.780
Field Marshal Göring
gave me that painting.

12:44.946 --> 12:47.051
Lovely, isn't it?

12:51.154 --> 12:54.951
I imagine he found a bargain
in Paris last year.

12:55.506 --> 12:57.775
My corporal's waiting.
He's had a hard drive.

12:57.938 --> 13:01.768
Do you suppose there's somewhere
in these ruins he can find a bed?

13:02.547 --> 13:04.336
Sit down, Hessler.

13:05.939 --> 13:10.249
You have too little faith
in the genius of the German people.

13:10.995 --> 13:13.745
A few stones
have been knocked down...

13:13.908 --> 13:17.802
...but our country's strong,
united, determined...

13:18.068 --> 13:19.977
...and more productive than ever.

13:20.148 --> 13:25.330
The Allies think that their constant
air raids have undermined our morale.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.589
- This they'll never do.
- Why have you sent for me, general?

13:30.101 --> 13:34.356
You are our finest
panzer commander, Hessler.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.141
You will lead us to victory.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.700
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

13:39.316 --> 13:43.026
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

13:44.276 --> 13:46.764
Let me show you some of the results...

13:46.932 --> 13:50.162
...of what Germany
has produced underground.

13:51.061 --> 13:53.265
You will discover a new Germany...

13:53.429 --> 13:56.942
...and will take a new pride
in being a German.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.403
Our latest airplane.

13:59.573 --> 14:00.947
A jet.

14:01.109 --> 14:03.979
It flies at more than 900 kilometers
per hour.

14:04.149 --> 14:07.248
Within six months,
we will have enough jet fighters...

14:07.445 --> 14:10.741
...to shoot down every
Allied plane in the air.

14:11.222 --> 14:15.084
Our V-1 rocket destroyed
20 percent of London.

14:15.254 --> 14:19.477
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

14:21.237 --> 14:24.849
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

14:26.102 --> 14:29.168
It has two-and-a-half times
the firepower...

14:29.334 --> 14:33.393
...and double the armor
of the American tanks.

14:33.943 --> 14:37.325
Our Germany is far
from finished, Hessler.

14:37.974 --> 14:42.284
It's a very beautiful model, general.

14:42.903 --> 14:47.475
It proves that the Germans
are still the world's best toy makers.

14:47.639 --> 14:53.171
The toys we are making these days
are not for children.

14:54.295 --> 14:56.499
Let me show them to you.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.993
Hands up! Get on over.

15:19.161 --> 15:23.055
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against
the wall. Put them up, general.

15:24.025 --> 15:25.432
Well, boys...

15:25.593 --> 15:28.211
...looks like we've caught ourselves
a couple of big fish.

15:28.377 --> 15:32.632
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.
- That's enough, now.

15:35.641 --> 15:39.024
Sorry, general.
We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

15:39.194 --> 15:40.600
Very good.

15:40.762 --> 15:43.183
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

15:43.673 --> 15:45.561
Had you fooled, didn't they?

15:45.721 --> 15:47.510
Completely.

15:47.674 --> 15:50.576
Unfortunately,
I am beyond playing games.

15:50.746 --> 15:52.950
Oh, this is no game.

15:53.113 --> 15:56.114
These are German soldiers, all of them.

15:56.281 --> 15:58.900
Trained German soldiers.

15:59.066 --> 16:04.052
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers
attached to the 1 st Tank Brigade.

16:04.218 --> 16:07.317
These men will work with him.

16:07.482 --> 16:10.516
Major Diepel, kindly explain
Operation Transit to the colonel.

16:10.682 --> 16:14.294
The soldiers will be parachuted
behind the American lines.

16:14.459 --> 16:18.234
Their mission:
To disrupt enemy communications.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.916
We have organized many such teams.

16:21.084 --> 16:26.037
Each will be led by a man who has
actually lived in America.

16:26.203 --> 16:29.171
Schumacher here lived
in Texas for 12 years...

16:29.339 --> 16:31.827
...before returning to the fatherland.

16:32.508 --> 16:35.672
Tell me, lieutenant,
who is your favorite baseball player?

16:35.836 --> 16:38.105
- Lou Gehrig.
- Because he's hit the most home runs?

16:38.268 --> 16:42.393
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit
the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

16:42.556 --> 16:45.273
And what's your opinion
of Adolf Hitler?

16:47.869 --> 16:50.935
As an American, my opinion
would be offensive to these gentlemen.

16:51.133 --> 16:55.388
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer,
you care nothing for German opinion.

16:58.557 --> 17:01.721
Adolf Hitler is a crazy,
Austrian housepainter.

17:01.884 --> 17:06.140
He's a madman who thinks he knows
more than the whole general's staff.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.301
And he's leading Germany
to complete, total destruction.

17:10.108 --> 17:12.924
Perhaps you are going too far.

17:13.501 --> 17:18.073
To carry off this great deception,
even their reflexes must be American.

17:19.676 --> 17:23.474
Your reflexes are to be congratulated,
lieutenant.

17:28.126 --> 17:30.014
Insolent man.

17:30.974 --> 17:32.796
Let him have his fun now.

17:32.958 --> 17:35.674
If he is captured,
he will be shot as a spy.

17:42.014 --> 17:45.561
You must admit, we are very thorough.

17:51.807 --> 17:55.352
Even a pass won't get you through here.

18:32.993 --> 18:36.790
We will attack
through the Losheim Gap.

18:36.962 --> 18:39.165
It's defended only by a single battalion.

18:39.809 --> 18:43.671
The American division
on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

18:43.841 --> 18:46.426
Then the Our River Bridge
will be in our hands.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.743
From there, on to Ambléve,
with its road network.

18:50.913 --> 18:55.255
In four days, we will be across
the River Meuse.

18:55.554 --> 18:57.921
The strategic objective?

18:58.082 --> 18:59.543
Antwerp.

19:00.450 --> 19:04.160
By taking Antwerp, we split
the enemy forces in two.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.059
It will take them 18 months to recover.

19:08.643 --> 19:12.538
By then, we will have air superiority
with our jet engines.

19:12.737 --> 19:15.901
And we will have even more
significant weapons.

19:16.098 --> 19:19.710
Weapons which can destroy
an entire city with a single blast.

19:20.707 --> 19:23.674
You have forgotten
one important detail, general.

19:23.843 --> 19:27.737
With their present control of the air,
the Allies will smash our tanks...

19:27.906 --> 19:30.460
...machine-gun our troops,
bomb the bridges...

19:30.627 --> 19:33.245
...and cut our communications.

19:33.410 --> 19:38.081
Suppose I tell you there will be
no Allied planes.

19:39.556 --> 19:41.661
Another secret weapon?

19:42.532 --> 19:44.507
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

19:44.675 --> 19:47.523
...the northernmost weather station
in the world.

19:47.684 --> 19:50.718
We have been waiting two months
for this report.

19:51.332 --> 19:55.042
"A low-pressure area over northern
Europe, starting December 16th.

19:55.204 --> 19:58.947
Low clouds and fog
which will ground all aircraft. "

19:59.716 --> 20:02.400
- How long?
- Long enough...

20:02.564 --> 20:04.931
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.147
Unusual clock, isn't it?

20:09.892 --> 20:11.747
It has only one cycle.

20:11.908 --> 20:13.218
Fifty hours.

20:14.244 --> 20:18.271
We have the resources
for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

20:19.973 --> 20:24.064
Maps, clocks, toys.

20:25.317 --> 20:27.226
But with what will I fight?

20:28.294 --> 20:30.049
Colonel Hessler...

20:30.214 --> 20:33.312
...I'm putting you in command
of our armored spearhead.

21:12.551 --> 21:14.723
It can be done.

21:44.777 --> 21:46.565
This came in from SHAEF.

21:46.728 --> 21:48.868
I got a Christmas cake
from home today.

21:49.033 --> 21:52.066
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?
- Send this right through.

21:52.233 --> 21:54.950
Develop this. Bring me the prints
as soon as they come out.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.542
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Kiley.

21:56.712 --> 21:59.080
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

21:59.241 --> 22:03.267
Marching around under there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

22:04.010 --> 22:05.319
That's an order.

22:05.481 --> 22:10.304
I want every item on that menu delivered
to every soldier in the division...

22:10.473 --> 22:12.863
...especially those
in the forward positions.

22:13.033 --> 22:16.230
And I want them delivered
in time for Christmas dinner.

22:17.898 --> 22:20.516
Counterintelligence picked
this up from an enemy agent.

22:20.682 --> 22:22.569
Dated November 29th.

22:22.730 --> 22:25.664
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

22:25.834 --> 22:29.796
Officers and men who speak English
are wanted for special mission.

22:29.962 --> 22:33.607
Volunteers will report
to General Kohler's headquarters. "

22:33.770 --> 22:36.356
- What do you make of it?
- You know my opinion.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.043
This is one more confirmation.
They're going to attack.

22:39.244 --> 22:41.545
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

22:41.739 --> 22:45.962
They're probably preparing a fifth column
to drop behind our lines.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.672
Were you
in the State Department too, Kiley?

22:48.843 --> 22:51.746
I thought your experience
was limited to police work.

22:53.099 --> 22:57.256
Having been an inspector of police
doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.176
All cops aren't flatfoots.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.159
Your limited military experience...

23:01.324 --> 23:04.673
...doesn't inspire confidence
in your conclusions. If you think-

23:04.844 --> 23:07.691
Why do you keep saying
they're mounting an offensive?

23:09.516 --> 23:12.549
I spent 20 years before the war
asking questions.

23:12.748 --> 23:15.432
Ever since D-day,
you've had me doing the same thing...

23:15.628 --> 23:17.799
...interrogating prisoners.

23:17.965 --> 23:20.004
I can only report what I've learned.

23:20.173 --> 23:24.035
The German soldier facing us
is still an undefeated enemy.

23:24.205 --> 23:26.245
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.

23:26.413 --> 23:28.355
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

23:29.581 --> 23:32.002
I have 10 other officers in my section.

23:32.173 --> 23:36.297
We see the same information,
get the same facts as you, Kiley.

23:36.461 --> 23:40.390
All of us come up with one answer, you
come up with the complete opposite.

23:40.589 --> 23:43.272
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
you'd better lie down.

23:43.469 --> 23:45.771
Colonel Pritchard,
you may be my superior officer-

23:45.966 --> 23:47.722
He is.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.697
Excuse me.
Here are the prints you wanted.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.236
Thank you.

23:56.462 --> 23:57.956
Look what showed up on this one.

23:58.575 --> 24:00.517
I took it over the Ardennes.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.982
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

24:08.206 --> 24:09.930
So it appears.

24:10.095 --> 24:12.135
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

24:12.655 --> 24:16.397
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover
one in a peaceful neighborhood...

24:16.591 --> 24:19.755
...I recommend all of us
take a good look under our beds.

24:19.951 --> 24:21.609
Excuse me, sir.

24:31.119 --> 24:32.941
Step outside.

24:47.248 --> 24:49.353
With your permission, sir.

24:52.048 --> 24:54.416
This is from headquarters, Kiley.
Top-secret.

24:55.057 --> 24:58.603
The Third Army has been ordered
to attack the Germans in the Saar.

24:58.769 --> 25:01.933
General Patton is launching
the offensive in two days.

25:02.096 --> 25:03.525
Does it seem possible...

25:03.697 --> 25:07.177
...headquarters would commit an entire
army to an offensive in the south...

25:07.345 --> 25:10.923
...if there were any possibility of the
Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

25:13.458 --> 25:16.807
With all due respect to headquarters,
they could be wrong.

25:18.161 --> 25:19.917
Send this to headquarters anyway.

25:20.082 --> 25:22.153
There seem to be new features
on that tank.

25:22.353 --> 25:23.597
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

25:23.794 --> 25:26.380
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown
on this German officer.

25:28.626 --> 25:31.211
- All right, send this along.
- Yes, sir.

25:32.659 --> 25:35.561
Get up to the line and tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

25:35.731 --> 25:38.764
- I'm interested in any fresh information.
- Yes, sir.

25:38.929 --> 25:42.246
One thing more. What are
you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

25:42.418 --> 25:45.136
We're not paying you
to be a combat soldier.

25:45.298 --> 25:48.201
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?
- No, sir.

25:48.371 --> 25:53.161
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy
that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

26:03.924 --> 26:06.957
I see the colonel's
in fine appetite again.

26:07.123 --> 26:08.716
I am.

26:09.395 --> 26:11.436
Join me in a glass of wine.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.295
Thank you, sir.

26:14.228 --> 26:17.011
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

26:27.573 --> 26:29.361
Conrad.

26:31.061 --> 26:32.555
Speak.

26:33.396 --> 26:36.047
What does the colonel wish me to say?

26:36.213 --> 26:38.319
Speak your mind, the truth.

26:39.381 --> 26:43.537
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have
someone to tell me the truth.

26:46.837 --> 26:52.238
I've always been fortunate
to serve under brilliant men...

26:53.366 --> 26:54.642
...who know everything.

26:54.805 --> 26:57.621
From them, I've learned one thing:

26:57.782 --> 27:02.899
When all was lost,
these brilliant men never lost hope.

27:04.055 --> 27:05.615
I admire that.

27:06.998 --> 27:10.227
What else do you admire
about these men?

27:10.742 --> 27:12.367
The illusion.

27:12.854 --> 27:17.645
Maybe I'm not using
the right word, colonel.

27:17.815 --> 27:20.302
I'm not an educated man.

27:20.694 --> 27:24.371
The hope that there is
always one more chance.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.631
That is the illusion.

27:30.232 --> 27:32.435
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

27:33.815 --> 27:36.499
It's not my place
to speak of such things.

27:37.144 --> 27:38.966
Go on.

27:40.824 --> 27:43.092
I order you to.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.585
Colonel...

27:46.647 --> 27:51.666
...this new command is an illusion.

27:52.024 --> 27:54.129
Give it up.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.440
I am Martin Hessler.

27:59.737 --> 28:02.803
Four years ago,
my panzers overran Poland in one week.

28:02.968 --> 28:05.008
That was no illusion.

28:05.177 --> 28:08.854
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all
the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

28:09.049 --> 28:11.896
I conquered the Crimea.
That was no illusion.

28:14.073 --> 28:15.599
Today...

28:15.769 --> 28:19.031
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

28:19.193 --> 28:21.943
When I have a brigade of tanks...

28:22.105 --> 28:23.566
...that is reality.

28:26.265 --> 28:27.859
And who will drive your tanks?

28:28.025 --> 28:30.873
The men you led were soldiers.
Veteran soldiers.

28:31.034 --> 28:32.790
Are there any left?

28:32.953 --> 28:34.776
What will they give you now?

28:34.937 --> 28:37.207
I was by your side
in Poland, France, Crimea.

28:37.369 --> 28:39.279
Look at me, colonel,
I'm not the same man.

28:39.450 --> 28:43.280
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight
of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

28:43.482 --> 28:45.904
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

28:46.075 --> 28:47.700
They wouldn't believe it.

28:47.866 --> 28:51.346
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

28:51.515 --> 28:55.988
How sure can you be of the men
who will drive your tanks?

29:05.627 --> 29:06.904
Major Diepel?

29:10.460 --> 29:12.314
- Diepel.
- Yep.

29:13.147 --> 29:16.661
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assembled at once.

29:18.268 --> 29:20.919
Conrad, my boots.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.195
Your commanders, sir.

29:51.932 --> 29:55.031
Boys. Too many boys.

29:55.709 --> 29:58.612
The first battle will turn them into men.

29:58.781 --> 30:01.051
In the old days,
I lived six months with my men...

30:01.245 --> 30:05.140
...before going into action. I knew them,
they knew me. These are strangers.

30:05.310 --> 30:06.739
Too many boys.

30:06.909 --> 30:08.634
They have never tasted defeat.

30:08.797 --> 30:11.448
Do they know what is expected of them?

30:12.093 --> 30:14.614
They are ready to die for you.

30:15.198 --> 30:17.271
Can you ask more?

32:02.563 --> 32:03.905
Sing.

32:12.387 --> 32:14.297
Louder.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.278
Hold it. Hold it.

33:37.479 --> 33:39.584
Hold it. Hold it.

33:41.606 --> 33:43.876
Pull up. We got brass on our tail.
Take it-

33:44.039 --> 33:45.927
Pull it forward, you idiot!

33:46.311 --> 33:49.028
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!

33:53.639 --> 33:55.581
Just a little bit. Hold it.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.376
Hold it! Hold it!

33:57.543 --> 33:59.452
You're dropping my merchandise!

33:59.623 --> 34:01.695
Barrel and Eddie,
come on out of there.

34:01.863 --> 34:03.904
Come on, Cortland.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.487
Disaster.

34:09.319 --> 34:13.094
Solid. Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

34:13.288 --> 34:15.809
- Complain to my union.
- Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

34:15.976 --> 34:18.049
- We near enemy territory yet?
- Too near.

34:18.216 --> 34:20.125
- Give me a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

34:20.295 --> 34:22.270
Sarge, when will we see
some Germans?

34:22.440 --> 34:23.815
- Barrel?
- Smoke your own.

34:23.976 --> 34:25.253
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

34:25.416 --> 34:27.621
- You kidding?
- You cheapskates.

34:27.784 --> 34:30.338
Reach into my bag,
get me a carton of cigarettes.

34:30.504 --> 34:32.261
What's with you and the Germans?

34:32.424 --> 34:34.431
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

34:34.601 --> 34:36.989
You know, I've never
even seen a German plane.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.550
Sarge, when are we
gonna get in the action?

34:39.722 --> 34:42.143
What are you, some kind of a nut?

34:42.312 --> 34:44.768
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

34:45.577 --> 34:47.585
"I wanna see action. "

34:47.754 --> 34:50.306
- What's this?
- Put that back. That's merchandise.

34:50.473 --> 34:52.862
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

34:53.033 --> 34:56.579
- Who are you gonna give these to?
- Guffy don't give nothing.

34:56.777 --> 34:59.265
- He's peddling them.
- You keep tying it up.

34:59.434 --> 35:01.889
- Peddling them? To who?
- The boys in the front.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.801
They're gonna need that in Germany.
There's lots of broads there.

35:06.794 --> 35:09.544
- French perfume.
- Champagne.

35:09.706 --> 35:12.903
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle
where we're going.

35:13.066 --> 35:16.362
Because there's nothing,
nothing too good for our boys.

35:16.522 --> 35:19.391
- Yeah. What's in here?
- That's the mail.

35:19.562 --> 35:22.530
Are you gonna charge them
something for that too?

35:24.331 --> 35:28.128
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.
- Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

35:28.299 --> 35:30.917
No. When you get these thoughts,
tell me anyway...

35:31.083 --> 35:34.312
...because one thing I'm not
going back home again is poor.

35:34.475 --> 35:36.745
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

35:57.229 --> 35:58.985
Germans?

36:04.365 --> 36:06.852
This is the up-front front.

36:17.357 --> 36:19.015
Wide awake bunch of boys.

36:19.181 --> 36:23.305
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?
- I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

36:23.469 --> 36:25.738
What's the matter?
Close the pneumonia hole.

36:25.901 --> 36:28.389
- What were you born in, a barn?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

36:28.558 --> 36:30.500
We didn't know it was you.

36:32.366 --> 36:34.787
- Major Wolenski?
- He's over there, sir.

36:38.958 --> 36:43.235
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit
or I'd have had my men smarten up.

36:43.406 --> 36:45.479
How are you?
Hot coffee for the colonel.

36:45.646 --> 36:47.556
Come over and get warm.

36:48.078 --> 36:50.150
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

36:50.318 --> 36:54.825
That radio's been yakking between
Christmas carols we're all going home.

36:54.991 --> 36:56.747
Here, sit down.

36:57.103 --> 37:00.070
It's tough keeping discipline
when the only action...

37:00.239 --> 37:02.312
...is sitting on your butt
to keep warm.

37:02.479 --> 37:03.907
What are the Germans doing?

37:04.079 --> 37:06.665
Same damn thing,
except they don't have any heat.

37:06.831 --> 37:09.067
They gotta exercise
to keep from freezing.

37:09.232 --> 37:12.265
Well, I got a little exercise
for your boys.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.398
I wanna patrol tonight,
try to pick up some prisoners.

37:17.424 --> 37:19.813
Well, there they are.

37:27.695 --> 37:31.012
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.
- Come on, shut the window.

37:31.184 --> 37:33.094
What do you wanna
do that for, sarge?

37:33.264 --> 37:36.613
They're out of range. They'll
shoot back with something heavier.

37:36.817 --> 37:40.777
It's you or them, dogface.
I need practice.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.568
That's enough, sergeant.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.828
If you wanna play with that popgun,
you can go outside.

37:47.921 --> 37:51.816
What do you say I take the men out
for a field drill, lieutenant?

37:53.009 --> 37:56.424
In this weather? What for?

37:56.593 --> 37:59.494
Because they're drilling, that's why.

37:59.665 --> 38:02.961
I'll let you know
when I want a drill, sergeant.

38:03.122 --> 38:05.969
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

38:09.041 --> 38:11.311
I'll take that sergeant.

38:11.474 --> 38:15.500
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

38:16.401 --> 38:18.289
Here you are, colonel.

38:19.282 --> 38:22.795
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?

38:22.963 --> 38:24.751
Just sweeten it.

38:56.019 --> 38:58.353
You are Colonel Hessler?

38:58.516 --> 38:59.945
Who are you?

39:00.116 --> 39:02.505
How did you get in here?

39:02.677 --> 39:06.867
General Kohler's signature is magic.

39:07.061 --> 39:08.883
You will excuse us, major.

39:09.044 --> 39:11.794
Before you give orders,
may I ask your rank?

39:11.957 --> 39:14.323
Courtesan, first class.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.940
Compliments of General Kohler.

39:17.140 --> 39:20.621
I think we have covered
everything, colonel.

39:25.653 --> 39:29.363
General Kohler did not tell me
you were so handsome.

39:29.525 --> 39:32.874
What did General Kohler
tell you about me?

39:33.046 --> 39:35.021
Nothing.

39:36.406 --> 39:38.861
Whatever I want to know...

39:39.414 --> 39:42.764
...I'll find out for myself.

39:42.934 --> 39:45.355
I'm very good at that.

39:49.685 --> 39:52.686
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

39:53.429 --> 39:58.798
Or have you been at the front so long
you have forgotten your manners?

40:05.654 --> 40:08.273
What shall we talk about?

40:08.439 --> 40:10.773
Your wife perhaps.

40:15.415 --> 40:17.488
Won't you join me?

40:22.071 --> 40:26.130
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

40:26.296 --> 40:28.685
You are not paying
much attention to me.

40:28.856 --> 40:31.889
Very little has escaped my attention.

40:32.632 --> 40:36.144
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

40:36.344 --> 40:42.640
What he admires most about you
is your reputation with the ladies.

40:44.089 --> 40:49.206
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

40:52.089 --> 40:56.082
I have worked very hard
to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

40:56.249 --> 40:58.615
Do not the two go together?

40:58.777 --> 41:01.679
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him, "Thank you.

41:01.849 --> 41:04.719
I appreciate his gesture. "
And good night.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.918
You can make your own way out.

41:29.051 --> 41:30.938
Zero minus two hours.

41:31.098 --> 41:32.854
All units ready to attack.

41:33.018 --> 41:38.735
Repeat. Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.

41:48.475 --> 41:51.791
- Come on.
- Put them down, dummkopf.

41:55.899 --> 41:57.972
Hello, Kiley.

41:58.139 --> 42:01.849
I was curious to see how
you interrogate your prisoners.

42:02.011 --> 42:05.524
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

42:06.236 --> 42:09.400
I'm afraid you won't
hear any new answers.

42:09.564 --> 42:13.972
Sometimes it's more important
what you see than what they say.

42:23.804 --> 42:26.488
Could we get
a little more light in here?

42:26.653 --> 42:28.595
How's that, sir?

42:40.862 --> 42:44.124
So this is the face
of the undefeated enemy.

42:44.286 --> 42:47.155
It looks like you've captured
a Sunday school class.

42:47.326 --> 42:51.156
This all they have left to put in
the front lines? Where are the weapons?

42:51.325 --> 42:53.049
Here, sir.

42:56.222 --> 42:57.815
What's this?

43:01.245 --> 43:04.148
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

43:04.318 --> 43:06.292
- Did they put up any fight?
- No, sir.

43:06.462 --> 43:08.317
Just gave up.

43:08.510 --> 43:11.990
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

43:12.158 --> 43:14.013
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

43:14.174 --> 43:17.819
They're not even tough enough
to be classified as delinquents.

43:17.983 --> 43:21.365
Go ahead and question them.
Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

43:21.535 --> 43:23.423
Go ahead, Kiley.

43:24.159 --> 43:27.771
They could be plants put
in the front lines to mislead us.

43:28.959 --> 43:31.414
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

43:31.584 --> 43:34.715
Escort these prisoners to the rear
for proper interrogation.

43:34.912 --> 43:36.570
Yes, sir. Move them out.

43:36.736 --> 43:39.256
- Let's go, move it out.
- Go!

43:40.191 --> 43:42.711
These prisoners
were carrying these rubber hoses.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.116
Send them along,
and anything else you found.

43:45.343 --> 43:47.384
Yes, sir.

43:49.920 --> 43:54.110
Do you actually still think the Germans
are preparing a major offensive?

43:54.592 --> 43:56.567
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

43:56.737 --> 44:00.249
You mean those kids are replacements
for more seasoned troops...

44:00.416 --> 44:03.351
...sent to the rear
to re-form for the big attack?

44:03.521 --> 44:05.660
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

44:06.657 --> 44:10.367
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing
to you. Evidence means nothing.

44:10.529 --> 44:13.878
The only thing you can see
are your own cockeyed hunches.

44:14.464 --> 44:16.472
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

44:16.673 --> 44:20.601
I'm recommending you for transfer
to a desk in Washington.

44:23.522 --> 44:26.937
You can tell the president
how to run the war.

44:34.242 --> 44:36.064
Major.

44:48.706 --> 44:51.805
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

44:53.922 --> 44:56.639
She always told me
I'd never get along in the Army.

44:58.947 --> 45:02.143
I never had it so easy
in the police force.

45:05.443 --> 45:08.760
I've just been counting up
how many times I've been wrong.

45:08.931 --> 45:11.420
But never this wrong.

45:13.059 --> 45:15.165
All the signs point
to only one thing.

45:15.331 --> 45:18.779
Is it possible they mean
something else?

45:20.772 --> 45:24.929
Maybe this war is beyond me
and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

45:25.092 --> 45:27.808
Runner brought this from headquarters.
It's for you.

45:27.972 --> 45:29.281
Open it.

45:35.589 --> 45:39.364
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel
and his service record.

45:39.525 --> 45:41.892
I wanted that.

45:44.773 --> 45:50.819
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer.
Fine fighting record.

45:50.981 --> 45:54.210
Last reported in the Russian front
commanding a tank regiment.

45:54.374 --> 45:56.064
What's he doing here?

45:56.229 --> 45:58.498
I'd say that proves my point.

45:58.661 --> 46:04.379
Colonel Pritchard would probably say
he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

46:05.285 --> 46:08.931
I don't know. What do you think?

46:10.247 --> 46:15.003
Well, sir. I'm regular Army.
I don't get into beefs between colonels.

46:15.814 --> 46:19.840
But I'll tell you what some
of my stir-crazy men think.

46:20.039 --> 46:23.105
They think we got
a great opportunity here.

46:23.271 --> 46:26.304
We got a chance
to wipe out Germany.

46:26.471 --> 46:30.399
Just wipe it clean off the map.
Knock everything down...

46:30.599 --> 46:31.908
...every city...

46:32.071 --> 46:35.453
...every castle, all the bridges,
all the roads. Everything.

46:35.623 --> 46:40.260
Don't leave two stones standing
together. Just wipe the slate clean.

46:40.422 --> 46:43.619
Turn Germany into a prairie,
then ship over a few buffalo...

46:43.783 --> 46:45.726
...and let them start from scratch.

46:45.896 --> 46:48.480
Now, what do you think
of that, colonel?

46:53.159 --> 46:57.894
I think your men ought to wash their
socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

47:34.089 --> 47:36.937
- Speak English. Only English.
- Okay, lieutenant.

47:37.098 --> 47:39.847
Let's get this stuff out of here.

47:57.130 --> 48:00.327
Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

48:00.490 --> 48:05.412
Repeat. Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

50:13.424 --> 50:14.733
What the...?

50:14.897 --> 50:16.904
What's that noise?

50:17.072 --> 50:18.861
On your feet! Everybody out!

50:19.024 --> 50:22.886
- Sounds like a thousand of them.
- Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

50:23.056 --> 50:25.544
- Get battalion.
- On the double! On the double!

50:26.384 --> 50:29.232
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

50:29.393 --> 50:32.709
- Everybody out. Come on.
- Bazooka men, report to me.

50:35.025 --> 50:37.097
The line's dead, sir.

50:38.161 --> 50:40.910
Go! Go! Go!

50:54.066 --> 50:55.343
What's that?

50:55.506 --> 50:58.670
"What's that?" And you wanted
to see Germans, right?

50:58.834 --> 51:01.551
Come on! On the double!

51:02.226 --> 51:04.463
On the double!

51:07.122 --> 51:10.253
Turn them over! Turn them over!
Let's go! Let's go!

51:10.995 --> 51:12.904
Come on,
let's get this baby moving.

51:13.938 --> 51:17.833
Colonel Hessler reports
panzer Tiger moving to the attack.

51:18.003 --> 51:19.432
No enemy activity.

51:19.602 --> 51:23.497
Northern front reporting
panzer Eisen entering Losheim Gap.

51:23.667 --> 51:25.522
No enemy opposition encountered.

51:51.188 --> 51:52.781
Southern front reporting.

51:52.948 --> 51:57.683
All elements of panzer Eisen
linking up at road junction 0-2.

52:31.638 --> 52:33.613
Stay on my tail.

52:39.190 --> 52:40.652
Soldier.

52:40.823 --> 52:42.710
Did they give you basic training?

52:42.870 --> 52:45.521
Here, you do it this way.

52:48.951 --> 52:52.464
They're green, never seen action before.
What do you expect?

53:01.079 --> 53:04.658
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.

53:04.823 --> 53:06.350
Yes, sir.

53:08.728 --> 53:11.183
Stay here. One more man
won't make a difference.

53:11.352 --> 53:15.149
- I need to look inside one of those Tigers.
- All right, come on.

54:06.745 --> 54:10.575
Relay to Standard O-bay.
I've made contact with enemy.

54:10.746 --> 54:12.633
Meeting weak resistance.

54:13.242 --> 54:17.105
Take cover! Make a stand.
Take cover! Make a stand.

54:17.275 --> 54:19.379
Make a stand.

54:37.115 --> 54:38.489
Load.

54:38.651 --> 54:40.953
I said, load!

54:57.852 --> 55:01.430
Tiger to Tank 104.
Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

55:01.597 --> 55:04.117
Get off the road at once!

55:07.165 --> 55:09.020
There's your Tiger.

55:15.164 --> 55:16.888
Wait a minute.

55:17.053 --> 55:18.547
You're gonna need this.

55:18.716 --> 55:20.659
Take the greaser.

56:02.687 --> 56:06.200
Tiger to Tank 104,
what is your condition?

56:06.975 --> 56:09.757
Tank 104, reply at once.

56:09.920 --> 56:12.024
This is Colonel Hessler.

56:17.535 --> 56:19.096
Button up!

56:19.872 --> 56:21.300
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

56:28.416 --> 56:30.522
Hit them hard, Eddie.

56:49.633 --> 56:50.909
They got Blondie.

56:57.728 --> 57:00.576
Forget it. It's like hitting them
with tennis balls.

57:06.146 --> 57:08.250
Come on, let's get out of here!

57:11.618 --> 57:12.927
Get down and stay down.

57:21.058 --> 57:24.255
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

57:28.898 --> 57:30.906
Lieutenant,
keep those grenades coming.

57:36.291 --> 57:38.811
Fall back!

57:40.035 --> 57:41.725
Fall back!

57:51.843 --> 57:53.698
Fall back!

57:55.652 --> 57:57.888
Fall back!

57:58.052 --> 57:59.907
Get down.

58:17.860 --> 58:20.796
Get going. Stay low.

58:54.245 --> 58:56.133
Hessler to headquarters.

58:56.838 --> 58:59.937
Resistance very weak.

59:01.542 --> 59:03.135
Southern front reporting.

59:03.302 --> 59:06.084
Commander Nimke
encountering light resistance.

59:06.246 --> 59:08.734
Enemy retreating across river K- 10.

01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:09.734
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, somebody man this gun!

01:00:09.896 --> 01:00:12.482
- Here they come!
- There they are!

01:00:30.762 --> 01:00:32.900
Give me a belt!

01:00:52.811 --> 01:00:54.818
Hey, wait for me!

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:00.642
Grab the tailgate!

01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:04.516
Wait for me!

01:01:10.187 --> 01:01:13.057
- Where's your motor pool?
- At regiment, four kilometers.

01:01:13.228 --> 01:01:15.879
Let's get there.
I gotta get back to headquarters.

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:18.276
- Wait for me!
- Hold it a minute!

01:01:18.444 --> 01:01:19.938
Wait for me!

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:01.864
We haven't got a chance.

01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:04.615
Relax. Stay loose.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.489
You think we'll have to surrender?

01:02:09.231 --> 01:02:12.198
Well, I hear they treat
American prisoners real well.

01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:15.268
In a big battle,
they treat nobody real well.

01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:18.924
Come on. There's a back road
that leads to the motor pool.

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:22.414
- Maybe we can get us a jeep.
- How do you know?

01:02:22.574 --> 01:02:25.291
Because I studied the maps
when we arrived here.

01:02:25.454 --> 01:02:27.876
Just like you should've done.

01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:35.246
- What if we run into their lines?
- We're still ahead of them.

01:02:35.439 --> 01:02:39.182
- They might have advanced patrols.
- It's enough trouble keeping alive...

01:02:39.344 --> 01:02:41.449
...in this mess
without you bellyaching.

01:02:41.616 --> 01:02:44.780
If you wanna surrender, go ahead.
I'll make it easier alone.

01:02:44.976 --> 01:02:47.245
You're out of line, sergeant.

01:02:47.856 --> 01:02:50.244
Sorry, lieutenant.

01:02:50.415 --> 01:02:54.539
Look, I don't need help from you.
You wanna go on by yourself, go ahead.

01:02:58.064 --> 01:03:01.228
Are you coming,
or am I gonna have to carry you?

01:03:19.825 --> 01:03:21.417
Hello, Cheyenne.

01:03:21.585 --> 01:03:23.374
What's that? You're under attack?

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:25.162
In what strength?

01:03:25.361 --> 01:03:27.084
Well, what's your guess?

01:03:27.281 --> 01:03:29.867
I can't give you air reconnaissance,
I'm blind.

01:03:30.033 --> 01:03:31.942
- Get Apache.
- Call Apache.

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:34.376
Eddie, what's going on
in your sector?

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:36.815
It's only patrol action.
How heavy?

01:03:36.977 --> 01:03:40.012
Well, what does your
reconnaissance say? Nothing heavy.

01:03:40.178 --> 01:03:42.666
We're trying to get a picture.
Stay on task.

01:04:08.659 --> 01:04:11.376
The first phase of our offensive
was a success.

01:04:11.795 --> 01:04:13.738
The element of surprise
was complete.

01:04:13.907 --> 01:04:16.624
American communications
are in a turmoil.

01:04:16.787 --> 01:04:19.689
We must cross the Our River
before the enemy realizes...

01:04:19.859 --> 01:04:22.609
...we have launched
an all-out offensive.

01:04:24.692 --> 01:04:28.041
I do not believe I gave you permission
to smoke.

01:04:28.244 --> 01:04:29.967
Sorry, sir.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.893
Unfortunately, we did not have time
to get better acquainted...

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.224
...but all of you know my reputation.

01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:43.119
My command always suffers
the highest casualties.

01:04:43.988 --> 01:04:47.338
The price of victory is never cheap.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:51.502
In this battle, we will be
as hard as our tanks.

01:04:52.116 --> 01:04:54.987
I will reach the objectives
assigned to me...

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:56.913
...no matter what the cost.

01:04:57.653 --> 01:05:00.336
Signal from headquarters, colonel.

01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:04.686
Hessler, I congratulate you.

01:05:04.853 --> 01:05:08.017
- You're on schedule.
- I will reach the Our River as planned.

01:05:08.182 --> 01:05:11.215
But the enemy must not be permitted
to destroy the bridge.

01:05:11.382 --> 01:05:14.032
- Has Schumacher seized it yet?
- Not yet.

01:05:14.198 --> 01:05:18.060
Schumacher's primary assignment
is to disrupt enemy communications.

01:05:18.517 --> 01:05:20.852
I must have that bridge secured
for my tanks.

01:05:21.045 --> 01:05:22.900
I have no time to build bridges.

01:05:25.014 --> 01:05:29.105
Hessler, your bridge will be secured.

01:05:29.271 --> 01:05:32.686
We are expecting you to cross it
according to the schedule.

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:38.893
You know your line of march.
Coordinate with the map.

01:05:43.799 --> 01:05:47.028
Conrad, I have a headache.

01:06:02.807 --> 01:06:04.368
Fire! Fire!

01:06:20.505 --> 01:06:22.610
Land mines!
Why were they not cleared?

01:06:22.777 --> 01:06:24.784
Where are the men
with mine detectors?

01:06:24.953 --> 01:06:26.415
We are moving too fast.

01:06:26.585 --> 01:06:28.471
The men are following in trucks.

01:06:28.633 --> 01:06:30.062
They are all dead.

01:06:30.233 --> 01:06:33.047
The mine exploded
directly under them.

01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:35.831
Notify their seconds-in-command
to take over.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:38.449
Tell them I have absolute
confidence in them.

01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:40.816
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

01:06:40.986 --> 01:06:43.189
We've lost precious minutes
unnecessarily.

01:06:43.353 --> 01:06:45.720
Your troops were here
to protect the panzers.

01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:48.183
From now on,
until we clear this minefield...

01:06:48.346 --> 01:06:51.346
...your men will go ahead of my tanks.

01:06:53.146 --> 01:06:55.480
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

01:07:08.314 --> 01:07:10.550
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:20.154
Now, listen to me, all of you.

01:07:20.315 --> 01:07:22.868
I need precise information:

01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:25.490
How many men, how many guns...

01:07:25.659 --> 01:07:28.310
...how many tanks
the enemy are throwing into this.

01:07:28.475 --> 01:07:31.257
How much fuel are they carrying?
And get a move on.

01:07:31.419 --> 01:07:34.997
We've got 24 hours
before we scream rape.

01:07:36.476 --> 01:07:38.614
All right, Kiley, it's your turn.

01:07:38.843 --> 01:07:41.081
They're pouring through, general.

01:07:41.244 --> 01:07:43.186
Crack troops. Brand-new equipment.

01:07:43.356 --> 01:07:47.098
I looked inside one of their tanks.
They can chew up anything we've got.

01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:50.938
- Question is, where are they going?
- Do you have that information?

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.923
No, but he does. Colonel Hessler...

01:07:53.084 --> 01:07:55.539
...the commanding officer
of the panzer spearhead.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.398
When we know where he's going...

01:07:57.565 --> 01:07:59.953
...we'll know the objective
of the attack.

01:08:00.124 --> 01:08:03.540
The enemy is probing at five points
along an 85-mile front.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:06.076
With only that information
at our disposal...

01:08:06.236 --> 01:08:09.433
...how can you assume Hessler's column
is the spearhead?

01:08:09.597 --> 01:08:11.670
- The law of probability, Kiley?
- No, sir.

01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:13.746
The law of probability is against me.

01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:18.073
But in the absence of other information,
I've one chance in five of being right.

01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:21.401
- I'd like to explore that chance.
- How?

01:08:21.566 --> 01:08:23.322
- Well, sir-
- I'll tell you how.

01:08:23.486 --> 01:08:24.763
Watch the Our River.

01:08:24.925 --> 01:08:28.341
There's only one bridge, right here,
that can support heavy tanks.

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:32.121
I'd say that's where Hessler will be,
and that's where I'll be.

01:08:32.318 --> 01:08:35.962
Don't get too close to that bridge.
I've ordered it blown up.

01:08:36.127 --> 01:08:39.160
That's a good thing to know.
Thanks for the tip.

01:08:41.694 --> 01:08:46.363
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Go on, keep moving.

01:08:46.845 --> 01:08:49.595
Come on, let's go.
You there, keep moving.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.647
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

01:09:00.991 --> 01:09:02.997
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:04.988
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

01:09:08.287 --> 01:09:11.069
Move it. Come on, keep moving.
Step on it. Get going.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:14.078
Come on, let's get going.
Step on it.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.926
Hey, what are you stopping for?

01:09:21.089 --> 01:09:23.477
That sign.
When we came through before...

01:09:23.648 --> 01:09:27.510
- ... I recall Ambléve was that way.
- You're blocking the road. Get going.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.435
- Hurry up.
- Come on, let's go.

01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:33.145
Wait a minute. I tell you, those signs
point in the wrong direction.

01:09:33.312 --> 01:09:35.255
What's holding up the parade here?

01:09:35.456 --> 01:09:38.523
Somebody's been monkeying around
with those road signs.

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:40.761
That ain't the road to Ambléve.

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:43.645
Two hours ago,
I came here from Ambléve...

01:09:43.808 --> 01:09:45.435
...over this exact same road.

01:09:45.602 --> 01:09:48.318
Now, maybe they've moved Ambléve
in the meantime...

01:09:48.482 --> 01:09:50.783
...but two hours ago
this was the road to it.

01:09:50.944 --> 01:09:53.595
- Take off, Duquesne.
- Lieutenant, I'm telling you-

01:09:53.761 --> 01:09:57.078
Lieutenant, tell your sergeant
to get this jeep out of here.

01:09:57.249 --> 01:10:00.414
Move. That's an order. Move.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:07.834
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves
in Malmedy.

01:10:11.586 --> 01:10:13.953
- Come on. We're getting off here.
- Wait.

01:10:14.114 --> 01:10:15.804
Come on!

01:10:16.802 --> 01:10:18.263
Jump.

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.905
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

01:10:24.066 --> 01:10:25.954
We're supposed to be in Ambléve.

01:10:26.115 --> 01:10:28.537
We'll get there.
I gotta make a pickup first.

01:10:28.739 --> 01:10:31.422
- Pickup?
- I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.

01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:34.915
Germans are coming. They'll steal it.
You gotta give me a hand.

01:10:35.075 --> 01:10:37.147
Hey, you two!

01:10:39.043 --> 01:10:41.694
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

01:10:56.228 --> 01:10:58.595
Are you the last one?
Anybody behind you?

01:10:58.757 --> 01:11:01.790
Yeah, the whole German army.
Go ahead.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.424
You there, keep them moving.
Come on, step on it.

01:11:11.941 --> 01:11:15.421
Notify the panzers.
The bridge is intact.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.508
- Any sign of the Germans?
- No, not yet.

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:37.019
- What are you men doing here?
- We got orders to blow the bridge.

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:38.848
- Pile out.
- Wait a minute.

01:11:39.013 --> 01:11:41.086
That job's being done.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:53.085
How you boys making out?

01:11:53.254 --> 01:11:56.124
- Just about finished.
- Hurry up, will you?

01:11:56.295 --> 01:11:58.629
Get out of here
before those Krauts get here.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:01.093
- You need any help?
- I got a good idea.

01:12:01.255 --> 01:12:06.590
We'll give them all a hot-water bottle.
That water comes straight off the ice.

01:12:06.759 --> 01:12:09.312
Well, I'm sure loaded with C-4.
Can you use any?

01:12:09.479 --> 01:12:12.065
I imagine they could sell you some.

01:12:13.447 --> 01:12:15.073
Climb in.

01:12:21.159 --> 01:12:24.641
Hey, why do you got your wires
hooked on to that detonator?

01:12:27.303 --> 01:12:31.580
- I guess he's in a hurry.
- To get killed? That's not the way.

01:12:31.751 --> 01:12:33.312
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.295
We're gonna take a look
under that bridge.

01:12:50.793 --> 01:12:52.767
This ain't the road to Ambléve.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:54.278
That's what the sign says.

01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:57.637
The sign says thataway,
the map says Ambléve was this way.

01:12:57.802 --> 01:13:00.322
Will somebody straighten this out?

01:13:02.602 --> 01:13:05.285
Ambléve. Ambléve.

01:13:08.937 --> 01:13:11.807
- Hey, Wolenski.
- Oh, colonel.

01:13:12.842 --> 01:13:14.565
Hey, we're all fouled up here.

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:18.473
We've been ordered to Ambléve,
but the maps don't jibe with the signs.

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:21.732
How'd you get off the road?
This will take you to Malmedy.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.840
- Ambléve's that way.
- That way?

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:26.727
We've been following these road signs
the whole way.

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:30.752
And the MPs we ran into,
they've been directing us this way.

01:13:32.586 --> 01:13:35.074
They've been changed.
They switched them around.

01:13:35.243 --> 01:13:37.131
Those MPs you ran into seem okay?

01:13:37.323 --> 01:13:40.357
- What do you mean?
- Anything odd about them?

01:13:40.522 --> 01:13:41.799
Just regular Gls.

01:13:41.995 --> 01:13:43.850
We intercepted an enemy dispatch.

01:13:44.011 --> 01:13:46.597
They were recruiting
English-speaking Germans.

01:13:46.763 --> 01:13:49.349
What time did you cross the Our River?

01:13:49.515 --> 01:13:52.679
8:40. We were last ones across.
They were set to blow it.

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:54.850
- You see the bridge blown?
- No.

01:13:55.019 --> 01:13:57.637
But I saw the engineers
setting the charges.

01:13:57.804 --> 01:14:03.684
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell?
They weren't engineers, they were MPs.

01:14:05.451 --> 01:14:07.656
Murphy, get me headquarters.

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.755
And, major,
have someone switch that sign back.

01:14:10.925 --> 01:14:13.576
Red River Six. Come in, Red River Six.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.734
- Come in, Red River Two.
- Red River Six, this is Red River Two.

01:14:17.901 --> 01:14:22.309
Germans uniformed as American MPs
holding Our River Bridge.

01:14:22.508 --> 01:14:24.875
Bridge has not been blown.

01:14:25.036 --> 01:14:28.298
Repeat. Germans uniformed
as American MPs...

01:14:28.462 --> 01:14:32.389
...holding Our River Bridge.
Bridge has not been blown.

01:14:32.589 --> 01:14:35.404
Over and out. Let's go.

01:14:50.542 --> 01:14:52.517
Better hold it, Jack.

01:14:55.374 --> 01:14:58.091
- What happened?
- They ran into a firefight.

01:14:58.254 --> 01:14:59.977
German patrol.

01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:01.637
I don't see any Germans.

01:15:02.126 --> 01:15:04.973
They're in the river.
They didn't make it across.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:07.274
Get out of here.
We're blowing the bridge.

01:15:08.047 --> 01:15:10.632
What? Are you sure?

01:15:11.119 --> 01:15:13.028
Watch out, the MPs are Krauts!

01:15:38.416 --> 01:15:39.910
Oh, my God! Get down!

01:16:09.906 --> 01:16:12.905
Why are we waiting?
Get that tank out of the way.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:15.406
We are preparing
to tow it off now, sir.

01:16:16.753 --> 01:16:20.496
Tiger to tanks Leopard and Panther.
Blast that tank off the bridge.

01:16:36.338 --> 01:16:37.833
It's headquarters, colonel.

01:16:38.003 --> 01:16:40.337
General Kohler says
we are behind schedule.

01:16:40.691 --> 01:16:43.276
He wants to know
what's holding us up.

01:16:43.442 --> 01:16:48.778
Tell the general the Americans
are learning how to retreat.

01:16:48.946 --> 01:16:55.275
Tiger to Panther. Get onto the bridge,
push that junk right out of the way.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.373
Stay down.

01:17:43.894 --> 01:17:48.149
Murphy, call headquarters. Tell them
the Our River Bridge hasn't been blown.

01:17:48.308 --> 01:17:51.244
- The enemy's crossing in great strength.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:02.422 --> 01:18:05.651
- Let me have your rifle.
- What you need is a cannon, sir.

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:09.643
The last time I saw that German,
all I had was a camera.

01:18:51.671 --> 01:18:54.389
Can't you hurry it up, sergeant?
We lost the column.

01:18:54.552 --> 01:18:58.294
Do you happen to have a new carburetor
in your pocket, lieutenant?

01:18:59.288 --> 01:19:01.329
You mean we're stuck here?

01:19:03.929 --> 01:19:06.962
Nope. We can still walk.

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:11.511
Let's go.

01:19:13.434 --> 01:19:16.749
- Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?
- Hold it.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:22.542
We better find out
just who they are first.

01:19:28.153 --> 01:19:29.648
Down.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.581
Yeah, Krauts. Back.

01:20:15.317 --> 01:20:18.183
If you'd just stayed loose,
I could've gotten them all.

01:20:37.205 --> 01:20:41.335
Americans in headlong retreat.
Our forces are advancing on all fronts.

01:20:42.644 --> 01:20:44.886
Great numbers of prisoners
are being taken.

01:21:42.776 --> 01:21:45.265
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:48.368
If you wanted to make a run for it,
why didn't you?

01:21:49.466 --> 01:21:51.802
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

01:21:51.955 --> 01:21:55.695
My job is to look out for you,
go where you go.

01:22:00.156 --> 01:22:02.764
I sure got you into the wrong place
this time.

01:22:03.283 --> 01:22:05.679
But I'm glad you're with me.

01:22:07.613 --> 01:22:12.085
When we get to the POW camp,
they'll separate us...

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:13.938
...you being an officer.

01:22:15.956 --> 01:22:17.844
Yeah.

01:22:19.413 --> 01:22:21.395
I'm gonna miss you, sergeant.

01:22:41.821 --> 01:22:43.249
Run!

01:23:00.853 --> 01:23:02.517
Keep going!

01:24:01.468 --> 01:24:03.544
Get going. Come on, step on it.

01:24:20.182 --> 01:24:21.468
- Is she here?
- No.

01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:23.485
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

01:24:33.208 --> 01:24:37.209
I want you all to fan out. Round up
every man that belongs to this outfit.

01:24:37.374 --> 01:24:39.993
We will assemble here in 10 minutes.
On the double.

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:41.362
Let's go.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.590
What's all this?

01:24:54.743 --> 01:24:56.950
What's it look like?
My place of business.

01:25:02.401 --> 01:25:04.631
- What are the chickens for?
- They lay eggs.

01:25:04.796 --> 01:25:07.180
Any idea what fresh eggs
brings in these days?

01:25:07.357 --> 01:25:09.492
Oh, beautifuI, beautifuI.

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:13.233
All right, open the door,
that's my partner.

01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:22.708
Look, run down to the tank park
and check us both in.

01:25:22.873 --> 01:25:25.398
- But-
- And then report back to me. Go ahead.

01:25:26.177 --> 01:25:29.434
The chickens look scrawny.
Have you been feeding them regular?

01:25:29.599 --> 01:25:31.027
I was worried about you.

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:34.071
- Is it true the Germans are coming?
- Right through here.

01:25:34.236 --> 01:25:36.950
- We gotta sell everything, fast.
- Then you'll leave?

01:25:37.115 --> 01:25:42.709
Face it, kid, we're out of business.
One case of champagne, $360.

01:25:42.874 --> 01:25:48.348
Two dozen nylons, $80.
Twenty bottles of perfume, $200.

01:25:48.513 --> 01:25:52.986
Six hundred and forty dollars.
Here's your half.

01:25:53.186 --> 01:25:56.502
Three hundred and twenty dollars.
All right, what did you make?

01:25:56.668 --> 01:25:59.959
One thousand, two hundred
and thirty dollars. Here.

01:26:03.771 --> 01:26:06.744
What have you been selling?
I don't see much stock gone.

01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:09.435
- Take it.
- I won't untiI I know how you made it.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.183
- What do you think I am?
- What do you think I am?

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:17.305
- It's money I've saved for us.
- For us? What are you talking about?

01:26:18.331 --> 01:26:22.461
When a woman goes in business
with a man, it means forever.

01:26:22.649 --> 01:26:26.685
What's forever? The shop is closed.
The Germans are coming.

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:28.880
They've been here before.

01:26:29.057 --> 01:26:30.874
I've lived through it.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.589
I will live through it again.

01:26:39.264 --> 01:26:41.116
I will wait for you.

01:26:45.211 --> 01:26:48.479
How can you feeI this way about me?
I never laid a hand on you.

01:26:48.668 --> 01:26:50.497
That's why.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.798
You're in love with me.

01:26:56.256 --> 01:26:59.157
Just a second. Hold the phone.

01:26:59.323 --> 01:27:00.987
Hold the phone, here.

01:27:02.013 --> 01:27:03.512
Shut up.

01:27:20.763 --> 01:27:22.651
You know what?

01:27:22.817 --> 01:27:24.503
You're right.

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.382
There.

01:27:27.548 --> 01:27:30.368
You hold all the money.
I gotta go back in action.

01:27:30.533 --> 01:27:32.598
You don't know
what it's like in combat.

01:27:32.763 --> 01:27:34.911
You get shot,
somebody takes your money.

01:27:35.076 --> 01:27:38.297
Before the plasma comes,
a guy's got his hand in your pocket.

01:27:38.816 --> 01:27:41.365
Guffy. Guffy.

01:27:42.628 --> 01:27:46.203
- I don't want you to get killed.
- Who's talking about getting killed?

01:27:46.369 --> 01:27:47.866
You take care of the money.

01:27:48.031 --> 01:27:52.445
Sarge, the tanks aren't there. They've
been pulled back. We gotta catch up.

01:27:55.324 --> 01:27:57.212
So long, partner.

01:27:57.696 --> 01:27:58.971
Take care of yourself.

01:27:59.136 --> 01:28:00.563
Guffy.

01:28:04.421 --> 01:28:06.805
Don't you want to kiss me?

01:28:22.499 --> 01:28:26.074
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:33.944
Keep moving. Let's go, keep moving.

01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:38.109
Come on, sarge, we gotta catch up
with the tanks. Let's go!

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:40.611
Goodbye, Louise!

01:28:44.068 --> 01:28:45.555
Put that in there.

01:28:45.732 --> 01:28:48.280
Come on, get to it. Get to it.

01:29:22.759 --> 01:29:26.169
Lion Battalion,
take up bombardment position.

01:29:26.334 --> 01:29:28.505
Panther Battalion, stand by.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.317
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:52.647 --> 01:29:55.397
- Hold it. Where you running?
- The Germans are coming.

01:29:55.586 --> 01:29:58.689
- Where's your rifle? Where's your outfit?
- Captured.

01:29:58.854 --> 01:30:03.644
- Dead. Gone. They're all gone.
- Sergeant, stop that man!

01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:06.748
He's not doing anything we aren't.

01:30:26.406 --> 01:30:27.810
We're staying.

01:30:27.975 --> 01:30:29.946
Countermand that order to fall back.

01:30:30.147 --> 01:30:33.050
All units are to make a stand
where they are and fight.

01:30:33.215 --> 01:30:35.964
And that means everybody.
Except tanks.

01:30:36.165 --> 01:30:39.008
Clerks, cooks, bakers, staff officers.

01:30:39.208 --> 01:30:42.430
Anybody who can carry a rifle
is to use it.

01:30:46.242 --> 01:30:49.239
- Kiley.
- Come on, bring it all in.

01:30:51.397 --> 01:30:55.587
It's very difficult for me to say this.
I was wrong.

01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:07.044
- Sergeant, hauI them out again.
- Everybody out.

01:31:07.209 --> 01:31:09.404
Come on, what are you waiting for?

01:31:10.242 --> 01:31:12.036
Well, it looks like we're staying.

01:31:12.201 --> 01:31:15.126
- I never have a rifle when I need one.
- Take mine.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.475
- It's on the house.
- I'll return it later.

01:31:17.663 --> 01:31:20.448
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Come on.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.673
We're on the line, sir.

01:31:24.874 --> 01:31:28.130
GeneraI Grey speaking. Fred.

01:31:28.295 --> 01:31:31.493
I'm holding at Ambléve,
but I can't last without heavy stuff.

01:31:31.658 --> 01:31:33.440
What can you let me have?

01:31:34.372 --> 01:31:38.171
155s will do the trick.
Where are they? On flatcars.

01:31:38.336 --> 01:31:40.165
Are we still holding the raiI line?

01:31:40.319 --> 01:31:43.104
Good.
Now, when can you get them here?

01:31:44.543 --> 01:31:47.647
Well, not later, Fred.
We're counting on you.

01:34:23.555 --> 01:34:25.089
Bring that ammo up!

01:34:25.254 --> 01:34:28.970
Stack it up. Position, on the wall.

01:34:34.953 --> 01:34:36.900
Get some beef behind it.

01:34:37.443 --> 01:34:39.331
Hey, lay those logs in there.

01:34:44.652 --> 01:34:47.425
Let's go! Let's move it out.

01:34:49.644 --> 01:34:52.428
First Platoon, follow me.
Second Platoon, over there.

01:34:58.375 --> 01:35:00.134
Fire.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.869
Soldier!

01:35:50.022 --> 01:35:51.521
Go! Go!

01:35:58.093 --> 01:35:59.710
Everybody out!

01:35:59.910 --> 01:36:02.695
- Wait a minute. Where you men going?
- To the shelter.

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:06.175
- No, you're not. Grab your rifles.
- But we're cooks.

01:36:06.341 --> 01:36:09.515
Lunch is over.
Get your rifles and follow me.

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:16.288
- Stay away from the buildings!
- Soldier, up front.

01:36:16.454 --> 01:36:18.211
I'm in the Air Corps.

01:36:18.376 --> 01:36:20.677
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:23.817
We're driving them back.
They're running.

01:37:23.982 --> 01:37:25.634
This is only the first round.

01:37:59.239 --> 01:38:00.939
Why have you stopped?

01:38:01.104 --> 01:38:02.508
They have dug in.

01:38:02.673 --> 01:38:05.293
- It's a very strong defense.
- Bypass it.

01:38:05.458 --> 01:38:08.797
- I have considered that.
- There's nothing to consider.

01:38:09.871 --> 01:38:14.921
We must measure what we might gain
by what we might lose.

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:18.249
Come on.

01:38:28.715 --> 01:38:32.136
You were to have been 10 kilometers
west of Ambléve by this hour.

01:38:32.302 --> 01:38:33.576
Why are you still here?

01:38:33.777 --> 01:38:36.739
My first attack failed.
I must take Ambléve.

01:38:36.939 --> 01:38:41.093
We are wasting time.
Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

01:38:41.258 --> 01:38:44.196
Ambléve is an isolated resistance.
Go around it.

01:38:44.361 --> 01:38:47.535
We have surrounded
and bypassed Bastogne. Do the same.

01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:50.662
GeneraI, it will be dark in one hour.

01:38:50.828 --> 01:38:54.627
I want your permission
for a night assault with all my armor.

01:38:55.724 --> 01:38:56.998
ColoneI Hessler...

01:38:57.164 --> 01:39:00.515
...you will break off this engagement,
proceed with your mission.

01:39:00.751 --> 01:39:02.851
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:06.923
GeneraI, before you go,
may I show you something?

01:39:07.123 --> 01:39:08.609
What is it?

01:39:13.011 --> 01:39:15.335
A chocolate cake.

01:39:16.043 --> 01:39:17.389
Well?

01:39:17.554 --> 01:39:21.707
It was taken from a captured
American private. It's still fresh.

01:39:22.002 --> 01:39:26.403
If you will look at the wrapping, generaI,
you will see it comes from Boston.

01:39:26.698 --> 01:39:28.126
And?

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.854
GeneraI,
do you realize what this means?

01:39:32.078 --> 01:39:34.757
It means that the Americans
have fueI and planes...

01:39:34.958 --> 01:39:38.085
...to fly cake
across the Atlantic Ocean.

01:39:39.277 --> 01:39:42.026
They have no conception of defeat.

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:46.097
We have the opportunity here
to break their morale...

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:48.811
...to destroy their will to fight.

01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:52.646
That is why you must permit me
to reduce Ambléve to ashes.

01:40:04.044 --> 01:40:08.173
You have untiI 0400.

01:40:08.657 --> 01:40:10.345
That is all.

01:43:34.136 --> 01:43:37.263
We have silenced their guns.
Now we will attack.

01:43:37.428 --> 01:43:40.331
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

01:43:40.496 --> 01:43:42.254
Yes, sir.

01:43:58.196 --> 01:44:00.307
Second Platoon, over there.

01:44:00.472 --> 01:44:01.900
Let's go. Move it out.

01:44:02.065 --> 01:44:05.676
We'd better get going, sir, before
the town is completely surrounded.

01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:10.702
Shall I send a runner to Major Wolenski
telling him to cover our withdrawaI?

01:44:10.868 --> 01:44:14.313
No, that's the kind of order I give
to a man myself.

01:44:43.187 --> 01:44:44.780
Aim at the trench!

01:45:27.034 --> 01:45:29.335
Some more. Let's get closer.

01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:40.427
Bring up some more plastique!

01:46:13.914 --> 01:46:15.094
Major Wolenski!

01:46:16.345 --> 01:46:18.068
The generaI.

01:46:20.157 --> 01:46:22.965
Hurry up! Move that ammo up!

01:46:25.242 --> 01:46:27.507
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

01:46:27.673 --> 01:46:31.944
I'll need time to save what I can. Your
outfit will have to cover the withdrawaI.

01:46:32.121 --> 01:46:34.989
- They're coming down the chimney, sir.
- Do what you can.

01:46:35.166 --> 01:46:36.782
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:41.301
I only loaned you this rifle.

01:46:42.233 --> 01:46:45.715
- See you later, major.
- Yes, sir.

01:46:50.552 --> 01:46:52.346
Spread out.

01:47:09.467 --> 01:47:11.225
Bring up ammo!

01:48:52.725 --> 01:48:54.353
Sister.

01:48:55.711 --> 01:48:57.138
ColoneI, excuse me.

01:48:57.304 --> 01:48:59.381
We are looking for someone
who can help.

01:48:59.546 --> 01:49:01.068
Be brief.

01:49:01.245 --> 01:49:04.206
There are many wounded townspeople
in the church cellar.

01:49:04.383 --> 01:49:07.723
We need medicine, bandages.
Can you spare any?

01:49:07.959 --> 01:49:09.587
We have nothing to spare.

01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:12.986
If there are captured medicaI supplies,
give them to the nuns.

01:49:13.174 --> 01:49:15.864
Yes, sir. Follow me.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.494
He fired with this.

01:49:55.003 --> 01:49:57.588
Jean, Jean, Jean!

01:50:03.227 --> 01:50:05.328
Don't do anything to him, please.

01:50:05.505 --> 01:50:06.909
This is the boy's father.

01:50:07.063 --> 01:50:10.261
I beg you. He's just a little boy.

01:50:10.426 --> 01:50:12.951
He's my only child.

01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:16.502
Don't do anything to him, please.

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:22.591
Release the boy.

01:50:26.556 --> 01:50:27.865
Jean.

01:50:30.178 --> 01:50:32.373
Shoot the father.

01:50:35.842 --> 01:50:39.005
- Papa! Papa!
- No!

01:50:47.064 --> 01:50:48.657
ColoneI.

01:50:48.834 --> 01:50:51.194
The senior American officer
taken prisoner...

01:50:51.358 --> 01:50:53.458
...requests permission
to speak with you.

01:50:53.624 --> 01:50:56.763
- What does he want?
- He'll only discuss it with you.

01:50:56.928 --> 01:50:58.969
- Rank?
- Major.

01:50:59.583 --> 01:51:02.392
- He has two minutes.
- Yes, sir.

01:51:16.668 --> 01:51:18.297
Conrad.

01:51:20.928 --> 01:51:24.504
- What is this food?
- It's the best this town has to offer.

01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:27.866
I told you, tanks run on petroI
and soldiers run on rations.

01:51:28.031 --> 01:51:32.504
I must eat as my men do so I know
how far they can go. Take it away.

01:51:42.557 --> 01:51:45.554
- Conrad.
- Yeah?

01:51:47.938 --> 01:51:51.549
My Christmas present,
it's for your sons.

01:51:51.714 --> 01:51:53.471
Your promotion to first sergeant.

01:52:01.602 --> 01:52:04.280
My sons thank you.

01:52:07.454 --> 01:52:08.705
Go in.

01:52:12.988 --> 01:52:14.546
What is it?

01:52:14.723 --> 01:52:18.203
ColoneI, stragglers you've captured
tell me...

01:52:18.368 --> 01:52:21.472
...that helpless American prisoners
have been massacred.

01:52:22.274 --> 01:52:24.918
- Where?
- Malmedy.

01:52:25.083 --> 01:52:29.790
And as senior officer, I can't controI
my men unless I have your assurance...

01:52:29.956 --> 01:52:33.944
...they'll not be murdered. I want your
signed order stating that my men...

01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:36.316
...will be accorded the protection...

01:52:36.481 --> 01:52:39.549
...guaranteed prisoners of war
by the Geneva Convention.

01:52:39.903 --> 01:52:43.738
Unless I return with that order, coloneI,
the prisoners will riot.

01:52:43.903 --> 01:52:46.688
Undoubtedly, you'll kill us,
but so help me...

01:52:46.853 --> 01:52:49.567
...we'll take a hell of a lot
of you with us.

01:52:50.405 --> 01:52:53.272
There will be no signed order.
There will be no riot.

01:52:53.437 --> 01:52:57.331
You will not be allowed to return
to your men to instigate that riot.

01:52:58.523 --> 01:53:01.178
You listen to me, coloneI.

01:53:01.379 --> 01:53:03.479
There are survivors in all massacres.

01:53:03.644 --> 01:53:06.133
I warn you,
if any of my men are harmed...

01:53:06.298 --> 01:53:10.912
...you will be held responsible. There will
be no place on earth that you can hide.

01:53:11.066 --> 01:53:15.774
And when you're found, I hope I'm the
man that ties the rope around your neck.

01:53:18.181 --> 01:53:20.187
Major...

01:53:20.352 --> 01:53:24.152
...I have never liked threats.

01:53:24.317 --> 01:53:26.712
I do not kill prisoners.

01:53:26.878 --> 01:53:32.033
But I will have no compunction at
shooting you myself for your last remark.

01:53:32.222 --> 01:53:34.051
Then do it.

01:53:40.742 --> 01:53:44.482
You are deliberately trying
to provoke me.

01:53:46.299 --> 01:53:48.919
Yes, coloneI, that's right.

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:54.240
If I walk out of here alive, I know
my men will be properly treated.

01:53:55.526 --> 01:53:57.143
DiepeI!

01:54:00.353 --> 01:54:03.834
Return this officer
to the prisoners' compound, alive.

01:54:03.999 --> 01:54:05.462
Come.

01:54:06.559 --> 01:54:10.359
Major, I'm relying on you
to reassure your men...

01:54:10.524 --> 01:54:14.690
...I have no time
for troublesome prisoners.

01:54:18.181 --> 01:54:21.816
Tiger to Standard O-bay,
GeneraI Kohler.

01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:27.197
Your usuaI ration, sir.

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.825
GeneraI Kohler. Hessler.

01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:37.982
GeneraI, is it true that American
prisoners were executed at Malmedy?

01:54:38.206 --> 01:54:40.696
There are SS units
in the Malmedy sector.

01:54:40.861 --> 01:54:44.613
I can't assume responsibility
for every soldier on this front.

01:54:45.156 --> 01:54:48.318
Do you realize the consequences
of this act?

01:54:48.483 --> 01:54:52.059
I have lost 17 tanks and a battalion
of men leveling Ambléve...

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.645
...for the sole purpose of reducing
the enemy's will to fight.

01:54:55.811 --> 01:54:58.938
This massacre will stiffen resistance
to us everywhere.

01:54:59.103 --> 01:55:03.233
It will turn a demoralized mob
into avenging soldiers.

01:55:03.422 --> 01:55:05.286
You are being insolent, coloneI.

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.268
Concern yourself with your mission.

01:55:07.421 --> 01:55:09.947
You are to reach Saint-MicheI
by 1600 tomorrow.

01:55:10.112 --> 01:55:14.112
- Be there.
- Yes, sir.

01:55:43.622 --> 01:55:46.915
They've taken a beating,
and they look it.

01:55:47.682 --> 01:55:49.405
They're not a rabble.

01:55:49.570 --> 01:55:52.154
They're retreating like soldiers.

01:55:56.224 --> 01:55:58.431
There's still fight in them.

01:55:58.915 --> 01:56:01.759
Where are we gonna stop
and put up the fight?

01:56:02.632 --> 01:56:06.208
At our last line of defense,
the River Meuse.

01:56:06.373 --> 01:56:09.157
We'll cross it
and dig in on the west bank.

01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:11.836
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

01:56:14.916 --> 01:56:17.252
Still sore I pulled you out of Ambléve?

01:56:17.417 --> 01:56:20.130
I was contributing
to the war effort there, sir.

01:56:20.296 --> 01:56:24.544
Try to keep your feet from freezing
while we figure a way to stop them.

01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:26.751
They've made mistakes before.

01:56:26.916 --> 01:56:29.335
Where have they made one this time?

01:56:30.881 --> 01:56:33.252
Well, they got me mad at them.

01:56:42.763 --> 01:56:45.346
Shut up. We'll get there.

01:56:49.193 --> 01:56:51.648
Come on. Come on.

01:56:52.934 --> 01:56:55.035
Keep moving! Keep moving!

01:56:55.235 --> 01:56:58.751
- What's holding you up?
- I'm out of gas.

01:56:58.916 --> 01:57:01.984
I reported low about an hour ago.
Where's the fueI truck?

01:57:02.208 --> 01:57:05.984
Get off the road and wait for it.
Keep moving.

01:57:06.185 --> 01:57:08.568
- Pull it over.
- Move it!

01:57:10.562 --> 01:57:12.155
Come on!

01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:17.631
Keep moving.

01:57:17.796 --> 01:57:20.662
Keep moving. Move it.

01:57:31.436 --> 01:57:33.666
Where are you going?
Will you wait a minute?

01:57:33.831 --> 01:57:35.872
I need gas.

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.200
Oh, get down.

01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:44.356
Why, you ugly jerk!

01:57:55.649 --> 01:57:58.586
Here, use your big mouth on that.

01:57:59.814 --> 01:58:01.855
Hey, come on, let's get with it.

01:58:06.186 --> 01:58:08.994
What are you laughing at?
Come and move this thing.

01:58:09.159 --> 01:58:11.814
- You're all wet, sarge.
- Now get it up.

01:58:18.281 --> 01:58:21.891
- What are you gonna do with this?
- "What are you gonna do with this?"

01:58:22.056 --> 01:58:23.944
Siphon with it, idiot. Put it in.

01:58:25.643 --> 01:58:28.641
- What are you thinking?
- Same thing you are.

01:58:28.806 --> 01:58:31.591
Those prisoners you brought
had rubber hoses on them.

01:58:31.756 --> 01:58:33.950
They've been carrying those
to siphon gas?

01:58:34.115 --> 01:58:36.510
At the Our River,
I saw a German fueI truck...

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:39.048
...drop oiI drums in the water,
they floated.

01:58:39.874 --> 01:58:42.694
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Gasoline, sir.

01:58:42.859 --> 01:58:46.599
Empty fueI drums and men carrying
siphon hoses add up to one thing.

01:58:46.764 --> 01:58:49.632
The Germans are low on gas.
They have to forage for it.

01:58:49.797 --> 01:58:51.968
That's their weakness.

01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:56.346
- Get this off to headquarters.
- Sir.

01:58:56.712 --> 01:59:01.018
A, what is the fueI consumption
of a Tiger tank?

01:59:01.644 --> 01:59:05.278
B, the exact distance from the
Siegfried Line to the Meuse River.

01:59:05.444 --> 01:59:09.785
C, what is the estimate of fueI reserves
in the German army?

01:59:09.962 --> 01:59:12.476
- That's it.
- Yes, sir, right away.

01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:18.400
What are you laughing at, you idiot?

01:59:27.532 --> 01:59:29.349
What is the situation in Bastogne?

01:59:29.515 --> 01:59:32.453
Our forces have completely
encircled the Americans.

01:59:32.618 --> 01:59:37.090
Their situation is hopeless. They have
no recourse but to surrender.

01:59:41.161 --> 01:59:44.323
Hey, look what's coming. Lieutenant!

01:59:56.394 --> 01:59:57.892
Halt!

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:07.557
The German commander wishes
to communicate...

02:00:07.722 --> 02:00:11.108
...with the American commander
of the encircled town of Bastogne.

02:00:11.273 --> 02:00:13.987
He's a little busy right now.
What's on your mind?

02:00:16.076 --> 02:00:19.899
"From the German commanding generaI
to the commander of American troops...

02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:21.669
...fighting in Bastogne.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:24.548
With the changing fortunes of war...

02:00:24.713 --> 02:00:27.875
...the U.S.A. forces
in and around Bastogne...

02:00:28.041 --> 02:00:32.867
...have become completely surrounded
by superior German armored units.

02:00:33.481 --> 02:00:36.324
The only possibility
to spare the American troops...

02:00:36.489 --> 02:00:40.548
...from totaI annihilation
is their honorable surrender...

02:00:40.749 --> 02:00:45.127
...which will also prevent the slaughter
of helpless civilians. "

02:00:45.799 --> 02:00:48.524
You have one hour of truce to reply.

02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:51.758
Blindfold him.

02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:53.705
Take him up to the command post.

02:01:10.225 --> 02:01:12.289
Repeat, please.

02:01:14.566 --> 02:01:16.360
Is that all?

02:01:16.525 --> 02:01:19.204
Sir, I have a message from Bastogne.

02:01:24.206 --> 02:01:25.481
What is it?

02:01:25.646 --> 02:01:28.289
I don't understand it.

02:01:29.741 --> 02:01:33.411
"From the American commander of
Bastogne to the German commander.

02:01:33.576 --> 02:01:35.239
Nuts. "

02:01:38.696 --> 02:01:40.455
Nuts.

02:02:49.034 --> 02:02:50.922
Hey, over there.

02:02:52.267 --> 02:02:53.518
Hey, it's an officer.

02:02:53.707 --> 02:02:55.500
Boy, are we glad to see you.

02:02:55.666 --> 02:02:58.439
- I haven't eaten in 12 hours.
- We got lost.

02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:00.043
Hold it. Wait a minute.

02:03:00.208 --> 02:03:02.886
Do you think we should surrender,
lieutenant?

02:03:05.129 --> 02:03:06.922
Surrender?

02:03:07.819 --> 02:03:09.412
No.

02:03:11.371 --> 02:03:14.639
Just stay loose, all of you. Stay loose.

02:03:14.828 --> 02:03:16.645
Now, give me that light.

02:03:24.009 --> 02:03:26.698
All right, spread out.
Get some rest.

02:03:26.863 --> 02:03:29.223
We'll get started when it's light.

02:03:58.923 --> 02:04:00.233
GeneraI Grey.

02:04:00.434 --> 02:04:02.734
Sir, this just came in.

02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:07.053
- Move along.
- Any of you guys been to Ambléve?

02:04:07.218 --> 02:04:09.130
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

02:04:09.295 --> 02:04:13.283
- Any of you guys been to Ambléve?
- Come on, Guffy, we'll get in trouble.

02:04:13.448 --> 02:04:15.242
I gotta know.

02:04:16.398 --> 02:04:18.310
I've been to Ambléve.

02:04:18.475 --> 02:04:20.009
- You know Ambléve inn?
- Yeah.

02:04:20.174 --> 02:04:21.602
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

02:04:21.779 --> 02:04:24.234
There's nothing left of it.

02:04:28.622 --> 02:04:30.699
Guffy, come on.

02:04:35.726 --> 02:04:38.145
When are they gonna let us fight?

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.398
Let's go.

02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:48.777
It's here, sir, the information
you requested from headquarters.

02:04:50.770 --> 02:04:52.292
That's it.

02:04:52.458 --> 02:04:54.476
They're running out of gas.

02:04:55.502 --> 02:04:58.405
Where's the spearhead of
the German advance right now?

02:04:58.570 --> 02:05:02.251
We place it four miles past Ambléve,
moving west.

02:05:02.416 --> 02:05:04.068
Where will they be at daybreak?

02:05:04.269 --> 02:05:09.355
If they traveI all night, they should be
nine miles due east of the fueI depot.

02:05:09.556 --> 02:05:11.656
We'll be there to meet them.

02:05:11.821 --> 02:05:14.476
I'm committing my tanks.

02:05:14.641 --> 02:05:16.458
We'll use plan F.

02:05:16.623 --> 02:05:19.727
- Get me Blue Code 301.
-301.

02:05:20.022 --> 02:05:24.140
All right, mount up. Crank them up.
Let's go. Let's go.

02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:28.942
Let's go. Crank them up,
crank them up.

02:05:50.098 --> 02:05:52.034
Look at that fog.

02:05:52.942 --> 02:05:56.365
If it stays, we won't find them
and we won't fight.

02:05:57.014 --> 02:05:59.822
If it lifts, they'll find us.

02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:03.597
And that will be the end of our men
and our tanks.

02:06:05.356 --> 02:06:07.975
And I'm praying that it lifts.

02:06:09.970 --> 02:06:12.495
What does that make me, Dan?

02:06:13.935 --> 02:06:15.822
A generaI.

02:06:27.598 --> 02:06:29.993
Is that so, generaI?

02:06:30.194 --> 02:06:31.657
It's very interesting.

02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:34.595
Thank you, generaI.

02:06:40.141 --> 02:06:43.044
Our column has made
the farthest advance.

02:06:43.221 --> 02:06:48.850
We have outrun the other panzers.
The eyes of Germany are on us.

02:06:49.015 --> 02:06:52.330
The Führer himself will decorate me.

02:06:53.333 --> 02:06:55.882
We have done it, Conrad.
We have done it.

02:06:56.047 --> 02:06:58.761
Then I was wrong.
We have won the war.

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.968
No.

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.693
You mean we have lost?

02:07:03.858 --> 02:07:05.746
No.

02:07:06.584 --> 02:07:10.537
I don't understand. If we have not won
and we have not lost...

02:07:10.702 --> 02:07:11.988
...then what's happening?

02:07:12.177 --> 02:07:15.693
The best thing possible is happening.
The war will go on.

02:07:16.177 --> 02:07:19.209
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

02:07:19.823 --> 02:07:22.891
On and on and on.

02:07:23.351 --> 02:07:27.127
- But it must come to an end.
- You're a fooI, Conrad.

02:07:27.315 --> 02:07:31.988
Those of us who understood
knew, in 1941, we could never win.

02:07:32.496 --> 02:07:35.729
You mean, coloneI, for three years,
we have been fighting...

02:07:35.894 --> 02:07:39.882
- ... without any hope of victory?
- There are many kinds of victory.

02:07:40.047 --> 02:07:43.882
For the German army to survive,
for us to remain in uniform...

02:07:44.048 --> 02:07:46.573
...that is our victory.

02:07:46.738 --> 02:07:51.375
Conrad, the world is not going
to get rid of us after all.

02:07:53.263 --> 02:07:55.210
But when do we go home?

02:07:57.015 --> 02:07:58.632
This is our home.

02:08:00.792 --> 02:08:06.384
And my sons? When do I see them?
What will become of them?

02:08:07.057 --> 02:08:12.426
They will become German soldiers,
and you will be proud of them.

02:08:19.765 --> 02:08:21.039
Conrad.

02:08:21.205 --> 02:08:25.677
You still have any of those delicacies left
you offered me at Ambléve?

02:08:25.878 --> 02:08:26.857
Yes, sir.

02:08:27.188 --> 02:08:31.211
Prepare them for me, will you?
I'm in very good appetite.

02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:37.772
- See anything?
- Nothing.

02:08:37.937 --> 02:08:40.048
It's like they disappeared.

02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:46.373
- They been spotted yet?
- No, sir.

02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:49.005
They must have changed course
during the night.

02:08:51.034 --> 02:08:53.040
Call our scouts again.

02:09:00.698 --> 02:09:03.176
- See anything?
- Nothing.

02:09:03.672 --> 02:09:05.677
Red River Six. Red River Six.

02:09:05.842 --> 02:09:07.600
Scouted designated territory.

02:09:07.766 --> 02:09:09.253
No sign of German tanks.

02:09:18.232 --> 02:09:22.763
Can't see 20 yards. They're nowhere
around, or I'd hear something.

02:09:25.171 --> 02:09:26.705
Let's be reasonable, coloneI.

02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:29.902
You expect me to take you up?
Nothing's flying in this fog.

02:09:30.067 --> 02:09:32.781
That makes it safe. We won't
bump into another plane.

02:09:32.946 --> 02:09:36.392
How can we see the panzer column
when we have zero visibility?

02:09:36.569 --> 02:09:40.521
You'll catch pneumonia if you don't
stop arguing. Get behind that stick.

02:09:40.793 --> 02:09:42.645
Wait a minute.

02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:44.368
Where are the flying orders?

02:09:44.533 --> 02:09:46.386
I wanna see them.

02:09:46.551 --> 02:09:49.206
I wanna know what lunatic
issued them.

02:09:49.690 --> 02:09:53.029
There are no orders, Joe.
I'm the lunatic.

02:09:54.008 --> 02:09:57.100
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

02:09:57.690 --> 02:10:01.325
If we don't find that panzer column,
there will be no tank battle.

02:10:01.490 --> 02:10:03.496
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

02:10:03.673 --> 02:10:06.575
A lot of guys are gonna die
to keep you safe and cozy.

02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:09.560
You sure know how
to hit below the belt. That's dirty.

02:10:09.973 --> 02:10:13.620
We're not in a pillow fight, Joe.
Sorry it hurts.

02:10:15.708 --> 02:10:17.607
Get in.

02:10:21.301 --> 02:10:23.567
All reports negative, sir.

02:10:32.817 --> 02:10:35.567
Well, they must be someplace.

02:10:36.499 --> 02:10:39.367
The earth couldn't have just
swallowed them up.

02:10:42.068 --> 02:10:45.337
- Send out additionaI patrols.
- Yes, sir.

02:10:54.328 --> 02:10:57.644
What am I doing up here?
It's like flying inside a light bulb.

02:10:57.809 --> 02:11:00.629
Just stay on the course I gave you.
We'll find them.

02:11:00.794 --> 02:11:03.662
- How do you know?
- Hessler's looking for gas.

02:11:03.827 --> 02:11:06.965
He's gambling on capturing our supply.
Get lower.

02:11:07.154 --> 02:11:10.458
- We're down to 500 feet.
- We just have to pick up a landmark.

02:11:10.612 --> 02:11:14.128
Hills are all around. We'll pick up
a landmark right in the kisser.

02:11:14.293 --> 02:11:16.052
Try it a little lower.

02:11:24.854 --> 02:11:28.370
- I can't see a damn thing.
- All right, cut your engine.

02:11:28.890 --> 02:11:31.095
Glide and listen. We can hear them.

02:11:31.261 --> 02:11:36.854
- Are you telling me to glide at 200 feet?
- Cut the talk and the engine.

02:11:53.787 --> 02:11:57.774
- I'm calling this off.
- Sure. Now, let's try it again.

02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:04.312
Okay, cut your engine.

02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:10.707
If we were 100 feet higher,
I'd jump and leave you here.

02:12:10.872 --> 02:12:12.430
Quiet.

02:12:21.492 --> 02:12:23.946
There's the depot.

02:12:28.702 --> 02:12:30.553
There's the river.

02:12:31.899 --> 02:12:34.613
The column has to be due south.

02:12:36.312 --> 02:12:37.587
That's your course.

02:12:41.174 --> 02:12:43.734
Get her down, Joe,
where we can see.

02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:49.835
- What's our altitude?
- Four hundred feet.

02:12:50.012 --> 02:12:52.077
All right, cut the engine.

02:13:00.501 --> 02:13:01.965
Do you hear that?

02:13:02.142 --> 02:13:04.277
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

02:13:16.053 --> 02:13:18.744
Hit your engine, let's get out of here.

02:13:21.079 --> 02:13:24.348
Red River Six, this is Red River Two.
The enemy column sighted.

02:13:24.502 --> 02:13:28.467
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

02:13:28.667 --> 02:13:31.122
Enemy column sighted, sir.

02:13:31.286 --> 02:13:33.150
Found them.

02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:37.623
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

02:13:42.296 --> 02:13:44.785
Repeat. Enemy column sighted.

02:13:48.832 --> 02:13:51.606
Come in, Red River Two.
Come in, Red River Two.

02:13:51.806 --> 02:13:53.116
Come in, Red River Two.

02:13:53.269 --> 02:13:55.417
- Contact broken.
- Where's that coordinate?

02:13:55.581 --> 02:13:57.363
- Right here.
- What's the terrain?

02:13:57.564 --> 02:13:59.192
Low rolling hills.

02:13:59.358 --> 02:14:01.812
Order our tanks to intercept them
at that point.

02:14:01.977 --> 02:14:04.078
- Yes, sir.
- Red River Two.

02:14:04.278 --> 02:14:07.382
- That's Kiley.
- I know.

02:14:10.048 --> 02:14:12.054
There's a plane up there.

02:14:13.659 --> 02:14:15.901
He's in trouble.

02:14:30.934 --> 02:14:34.036
Medic! Medic!

02:14:53.624 --> 02:14:55.194
Schneider.

02:14:56.668 --> 02:14:58.804
From Spitzbergen,
the weather forecast.

02:14:59.004 --> 02:15:01.176
Warm front moving in.

02:15:03.064 --> 02:15:06.864
Notify all columns, weather clearing.

02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:27.985
Enemy forces are reported crossing
the River Meuse.

02:15:28.162 --> 02:15:31.194
Send scouts forward.
I want their numbers and composition.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:32.374
Yes, sir.

02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:35.406
Conrad. My binoculars.

02:15:37.825 --> 02:15:39.678
Conrad?

02:15:47.713 --> 02:15:49.755
I was saying I wanted-

02:15:51.737 --> 02:15:53.850
What is it, Conrad?

02:15:54.015 --> 02:15:56.469
Nothing, sir.

02:15:58.168 --> 02:16:02.451
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

02:16:06.239 --> 02:16:08.304
What's wrong?

02:16:09.377 --> 02:16:13.602
I would like to be transferred
to other duties, sir.

02:16:16.575 --> 02:16:21.814
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't ask me, sir. Just transfer me.

02:16:22.817 --> 02:16:25.590
- For combat duty?
- Yes, sir.

02:16:27.042 --> 02:16:30.818
You want to fight?
Very admirable, but why?

02:16:32.954 --> 02:16:35.348
PersonaI reasons, sir.

02:16:37.626 --> 02:16:39.927
PersonaI reasons.

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:44.859
PersonaI reasons? What the deviI
are you trying to say?

02:16:45.025 --> 02:16:48.056
It's the right of every German soldier
to ask permission...

02:16:48.222 --> 02:16:50.322
...for a transfer to other duties.

02:16:50.499 --> 02:16:53.839
It is the right of every commanding
officer to know the reason...

02:16:54.016 --> 02:16:58.558
- ... for the transfer, and I
want the truth. - The truth...

02:16:58.723 --> 02:17:02.546
...is that I'm a fooI.
I believed in you.

02:17:02.723 --> 02:17:05.331
But all you believe in is the war.

02:17:05.496 --> 02:17:08.540
You have the war. You like the war.

02:17:08.706 --> 02:17:11.998
And all I have are my sons,
and I don't want to lose them.

02:17:12.799 --> 02:17:16.730
- I'm not responsible for your children.
- You are. You'd make them soldiers.

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:18.807
- Yes. They will fight.
- They will die.

02:17:18.972 --> 02:17:22.428
- If necessary.
- Necessary for who? For you?

02:17:24.057 --> 02:17:27.385
You are not only a fooI,
you are a traitor.

02:17:29.945 --> 02:17:32.990
And you are a murderer.

02:17:33.155 --> 02:17:37.945
You would murder my sons.
You would murder my country.

02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:41.496
You would murder the whole world
to stay in that uniform.

02:17:49.757 --> 02:17:52.341
It is only the memory of you
as a friend...

02:17:52.505 --> 02:17:56.259
...that prevents me from having you
court-martialed. Get out.

02:18:04.955 --> 02:18:08.377
Our scouts have sighted a brigade
of medium tanks.

02:18:09.923 --> 02:18:13.427
- Light armor at this point? Any artillery?
- None.

02:18:13.603 --> 02:18:16.352
- And no infantry.
- They're committing their reserves.

02:18:16.505 --> 02:18:20.129
We destroy them, they have nothing
between us and the fueI depot.

02:18:21.215 --> 02:18:24.352
- Send all infantry to the rear.
- Yes, sir.

02:18:25.757 --> 02:18:30.973
DiepeI, assign this man to fueI trucks.

02:18:33.829 --> 02:18:35.680
Yes, sir.

02:18:39.716 --> 02:18:42.171
Sir, enemy advancing on our position.

02:18:42.335 --> 02:18:45.687
Good. They've taken the bait.

02:18:47.102 --> 02:18:48.660
Pritchard...

02:18:48.837 --> 02:18:52.177
...we're going to test that information
we got from headquarters.

02:18:53.605 --> 02:18:55.646
If it's accurate...

02:18:56.071 --> 02:18:58.620
...we'll run them out of gas.

02:19:01.439 --> 02:19:06.018
Tiger to all units, close hatches.
Forward.

02:19:57.476 --> 02:20:00.095
Butcher, swing up and take positions
on the ridges.

02:20:04.839 --> 02:20:09.476
And watch that damn gully.
This is no time to lose a track.

02:20:36.744 --> 02:20:38.715
Here they come.

02:20:45.512 --> 02:20:48.473
Hold your fire
till they're right on us.

02:20:51.553 --> 02:20:54.975
Load with hypershot.
Make every one count.

02:21:04.521 --> 02:21:06.114
- Hold your fire.
- How long?

02:21:06.279 --> 02:21:07.931
UntiI I tell you!

02:21:11.849 --> 02:21:13.441
Attack in staggered formation.

02:21:13.606 --> 02:21:16.533
First, Lion on the assault.
Second, Panther.

02:21:20.392 --> 02:21:23.684
Remember, hold your fire
till they're within effective range.

02:21:31.908 --> 02:21:35.106
- How long are we gonna wait?
- UntiI we can hit a soft spot.

02:21:36.003 --> 02:21:37.465
Steady.

02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:38.881
Steady.

02:21:39.046 --> 02:21:41.383
Hold it. Hold it.

02:21:41.536 --> 02:21:44.840
Let them come on in. Let them come in.
That's the way.

02:21:44.994 --> 02:21:47.684
Now! Let them have it!

02:22:13.890 --> 02:22:16.994
Fire one more round,
then let's get the hell off this ridge.

02:22:28.864 --> 02:22:32.169
There's one coming up over the rise.
You see him?

02:22:33.986 --> 02:22:36.570
Steady, boy. Ready on.

02:22:38.504 --> 02:22:40.416
Fire!

02:22:50.658 --> 02:22:54.175
Tiger to Panther, spread out to left.
Lion, spread out to right.

02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:56.322
We will try to encircle.

02:23:01.196 --> 02:23:04.251
Sherman damaged.
We'll finish it off.

02:23:04.417 --> 02:23:08.134
Fire! It's a hit.

02:23:08.901 --> 02:23:10.789
The next, 11 o'clock, 900.

02:23:16.641 --> 02:23:17.632
Get in among them.

02:23:17.797 --> 02:23:20.995
Mix with them so they can't fire
without hitting each other.

02:23:29.833 --> 02:23:33.928
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.
There's a Kraut at 1 o'clock...

02:23:34.093 --> 02:23:35.910
...with a pennant on his antenna.

02:23:37.834 --> 02:23:39.898
This one belongs to me. He's mine.

02:23:40.547 --> 02:23:42.270
There he is.

02:23:42.435 --> 02:23:47.297
All right, kick her left, kid. Left.
Now, hard right! Hard right!

02:23:50.153 --> 02:23:54.494
Stay with them! Range, 9-0-0.
Up two.

02:23:55.721 --> 02:23:57.350
Fire!

02:23:59.144 --> 02:24:00.571
Good shot! We got him!

02:24:00.973 --> 02:24:03.745
Load again. Nothing has happened.

02:24:03.945 --> 02:24:06.943
Hey, watch it. They see us.
Hey, let's get out of here.

02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:12.796
Aim just ahead as he runs.

02:24:19.403 --> 02:24:20.961
Fire!

02:24:29.928 --> 02:24:31.746
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.

02:24:31.911 --> 02:24:34.436
Come in, Butcher Three.
Report damage. Over.

02:24:34.601 --> 02:24:39.238
I've got one dead and two wounded,
but we can still fight.

02:24:40.772 --> 02:24:44.418
You lost your gun. Pull out. Try
to make it back to the assembly area.

02:24:44.643 --> 02:24:46.720
We don't need a gun!
We can ram them.

02:24:47.085 --> 02:24:49.186
Guffy, you're all busted up.

02:24:49.351 --> 02:24:53.610
Get out of there and make it back to
the assembly area. That's an order. Out.

02:24:54.566 --> 02:24:56.643
Get her over the hill.

02:25:00.974 --> 02:25:02.980
Driver, halt.

02:25:03.463 --> 02:25:05.056
Let's try to pick them off.

02:25:05.256 --> 02:25:09.516
Ten o'clock. Sherman, 800. Fire!

02:25:47.629 --> 02:25:49.446
Baker Battalion reporting in.

02:25:49.612 --> 02:25:52.643
Two tanks destroyed, one damaged,
out of action.

02:25:52.809 --> 02:25:56.703
Phantom Battalion reports six tanks
destroyed, nine out of action.

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.824
Butcher Battalion reports 11 tanks
destroyed, eight on fire.

02:26:03.405 --> 02:26:06.119
Keep burning up their gas.

02:26:17.069 --> 02:26:20.609
Commander to base,
I am returning to refueI.

02:27:05.966 --> 02:27:08.102
We are cutting them to pieces.

02:27:08.267 --> 02:27:10.887
And they are emptying our tanks.

02:27:15.241 --> 02:27:19.559
They are deliberately sacrificing
their armor to bleed us dry.

02:27:20.810 --> 02:27:24.551
- What is the distance to the fueI depot?
- Twelve kilometers.

02:27:25.318 --> 02:27:27.301
You will continue the battle here.

02:27:27.466 --> 02:27:30.403
Let them believe their strategy
is succeeding.

02:27:30.568 --> 02:27:33.353
I want 15 tanks and all
the empty trucks.

02:27:33.518 --> 02:27:37.472
- I'm going on to the depot.
- Yes, sir, 15 tanks and fueI trucks.

02:27:37.897 --> 02:27:39.596
Forward.

02:27:57.708 --> 02:28:01.283
Hey, come on, soldier.
You can make it.

02:28:11.785 --> 02:28:13.413
Pull it off the road!

02:28:13.614 --> 02:28:15.998
- Wait!
- Come on! Come on!

02:28:19.914 --> 02:28:23.301
Pull it off the road! Pull it off!

02:28:25.295 --> 02:28:27.231
Get off the tank.

02:28:27.408 --> 02:28:29.956
- Stay off the tank!
- You've got plenty of room.

02:28:30.121 --> 02:28:33.189
- You can carry these guys.
- This tank ain't going no place.

02:28:33.354 --> 02:28:35.502
Get off the tank!

02:28:36.045 --> 02:28:38.015
Wherever you're going,
you better walk.

02:28:38.192 --> 02:28:41.036
- What are you waiting here for?
- For the Germans.

02:28:41.202 --> 02:28:43.655
They gotta come by here.

02:28:44.847 --> 02:28:46.534
And I still got a machine gun.

02:28:47.762 --> 02:28:49.697
There's not much you can
do with that.

02:28:49.898 --> 02:28:52.966
- How much ammo do you have left?
- Two belts.

02:28:53.131 --> 02:28:56.068
That will take care of some of them.

02:28:57.201 --> 02:29:01.154
You got a wounded man. You think
you ought to get him to the medics?

02:29:01.803 --> 02:29:04.706
Oh, he's not too bad.
He can still fight.

02:29:06.028 --> 02:29:07.242
Get on, fellas.

02:29:07.408 --> 02:29:10.724
Pull this tank back.
Head it west towards the River Meuse.

02:29:10.889 --> 02:29:13.674
I'm warning you, lieutenant,
stay off my tank.

02:29:18.511 --> 02:29:21.449
Either put up that gun or fire it,
sergeant.

02:29:27.538 --> 02:29:30.830
It's okay, sarge. It's okay.

02:30:05.167 --> 02:30:08.482
GeneraI, another panzer column
has been spotted four miles...

02:30:08.659 --> 02:30:11.527
- ... from the River Meuse.
- Where did they come from?

02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:14.666
Get me the officer in charge
of the fueI depot.

02:30:14.867 --> 02:30:17.073
Get Silver Cloud 201. Quickly.

02:30:17.262 --> 02:30:19.562
It's not a new column.

02:30:20.813 --> 02:30:22.276
It's Hessler.

02:30:22.453 --> 02:30:26.348
- He slipped away from the battle.
- The fueI depot, sir.

02:30:26.513 --> 02:30:30.088
GeneraI Grey speaking.
I'm giving you this order personally.

02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:33.321
Destroy the fueI depot at once.
I repeat.

02:30:33.521 --> 02:30:35.622
Destroy the fuel depot at once.

02:30:35.787 --> 02:30:40.908
Yes, sir. I'll destroy the depot
immediately, sir. Set it on fire.

02:30:41.074 --> 02:30:45.805
No, sir, not a drop. I'll make sure
of that, sir. They won't get a drop.

02:30:48.590 --> 02:30:52.555
All right, let's get these bodies
out of here. Let's go. Move!

02:31:09.392 --> 02:31:13.003
Elke and Eisner report fueI
exhausted, sir.

02:31:13.168 --> 02:31:15.080
What's Hessler's present position?

02:31:15.245 --> 02:31:18.514
He reports being three kilometers
from the American fueI depot.

02:31:18.703 --> 02:31:20.908
We must get there.

02:31:21.109 --> 02:31:25.416
He will do it. Hessler will do it.

02:31:37.652 --> 02:31:40.426
No shooting. I'll do the talking.

02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:41.995
Get back to your post.

02:31:46.832 --> 02:31:49.487
- Hold it up there, sergeant.
- Stop it.

02:31:50.007 --> 02:31:53.830
- What can I do for you boys?
- We just made it. Could you fill her up?

02:31:54.007 --> 02:31:57.829
Sure. Give you a hand, soldier. Sure.

02:31:58.124 --> 02:32:00.426
CorporaI, bring some of those
cans over here.

02:32:00.591 --> 02:32:02.255
A couple of you boys help out.

02:32:02.609 --> 02:32:06.892
Sergeant, we'll have you gassed up
and on your way in no time.

02:32:07.057 --> 02:32:09.228
Get on your machine gun.

02:32:09.393 --> 02:32:12.072
- Hey, lieutenant.
- Yeah?

02:32:13.488 --> 02:32:17.453
Weren't you directing traffic
at the Our River Bridge?

02:32:17.653 --> 02:32:20.909
Does the road to Ambléve
still lead to Malmedy?

02:32:38.869 --> 02:32:40.497
Stop.

02:32:47.541 --> 02:32:51.046
This fueI dump must be taken intact.

02:32:54.327 --> 02:32:56.687
No shooting.

02:33:14.799 --> 02:33:18.256
- Look. Let's get out of here.
- Hold it. They'll capture the gas.

02:33:18.421 --> 02:33:20.652
We can't just leave it.

02:33:22.161 --> 02:33:26.634
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Hold it! They're after the gas.

02:33:28.368 --> 02:33:31.755
- We ought to blow it up.
- We can't set a match to all that.

02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:36.179
- We got no orders, lieutenant.
- Yeah? Well, I'm giving the orders.

02:33:36.592 --> 02:33:39.625
Hey, lieutenant,
one of them is still alive.

02:33:42.516 --> 02:33:45.230
Hold it! Hold it! He's one of ours.

02:33:47.094 --> 02:33:49.064
- I got you, coloneI.
- Burn it.

02:33:49.241 --> 02:33:51.566
- Take it easy. I know what to do.
- Burn it.

02:33:51.731 --> 02:33:54.516
- Give him a hand, if you can.
- Burn it.

02:33:54.705 --> 02:33:58.669
Come on, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!

02:33:58.964 --> 02:34:02.410
Get those barrels off the end
of that ramp. Hold your fire, Guffy.

02:34:02.575 --> 02:34:05.773
Move your tank behind that pile
untiI I tell you to shove.

02:34:05.938 --> 02:34:09.654
You, get me some hand grenades
off the tank. Come on.

02:34:14.422 --> 02:34:15.826
Come on.

02:34:17.136 --> 02:34:19.886
You, get to that gas truck
and open all the valves.

02:34:20.051 --> 02:34:23.248
Then get the hell away from it.

02:34:45.975 --> 02:34:47.791
All right, roll them down.

02:34:50.422 --> 02:34:51.697
Get off the road.

02:34:52.027 --> 02:34:54.092
Give me a hand grenade.

02:35:46.648 --> 02:35:48.335
He's getting away.

02:35:54.034 --> 02:35:56.430
Okay, shove.

02:36:04.890 --> 02:36:08.843
Don't stop! Keep going! Don't stop!

02:37:40.124 --> 02:37:41.883
Get this message to headquarters:

02:37:42.036 --> 02:37:46.744
They've abandoned their tanks,
and they're walking back to Germany.

02:39:40.307 --> 02:39:46.296
