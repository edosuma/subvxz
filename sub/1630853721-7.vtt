00:29.112 --> 00:30.155
Bert!

00:31.781 --> 00:32.657
Bert.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.786
A shrimp curry burrito? Really?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.371
That smell is never going away.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.832
Albert.

00:41.624 --> 00:42.834
He can't hear you.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.591
Bro.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.342
Chill.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.761
Clean up your mess.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.095
In a minute.

00:56.848 --> 00:57.849
I'll do it.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.268
Alby.

01:01.519 --> 01:02.687
He has to learn.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.014
The mind-machine interface is glitching.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.724
-Oh, I'm sorry--
-Fix it.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.531
Where are we
with the chest mount prototype?

01:59.702 --> 02:00.703
You'll have it tomorrow.

02:06.918 --> 02:07.877
Today.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.223
Are those…

02:21.474 --> 02:23.184
Are you listening to music?

02:24.519 --> 02:26.146
Uh, um… No?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.948
Pinky promise?

02:37.031 --> 02:38.658
It… it won't happen again.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.010
Albert Wesker!

02:57.093 --> 02:59.554
This is unauthorized use
of Umbrella property!

02:59.637 --> 03:01.681
Put your hands up! Do it now!

03:12.859 --> 03:14.694
<i>Wesker!
We know you're in there!</i>

03:14.777 --> 03:16.696
<i>We have the facility surrounded!</i>

03:16.779 --> 03:19.699
-Albert, we have to get out of here!
-<i>Come out! Now!</i>

03:21.618 --> 03:22.452
No!

03:22.994 --> 03:24.412
What are you doing?

03:24.495 --> 03:25.872
Destroying the evidence.

03:26.497 --> 03:29.000
Shots fired!
Shots fired! Move in!

03:29.083 --> 03:30.919
-Go!

03:38.426 --> 03:39.344
Bert.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.137
Bert!

03:43.181 --> 03:44.557
Bert.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.600
Are you okay?

03:47.477 --> 03:48.853
I, uh, I… I think so.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.939
Y<i>eah, we're clear.</i>

04:09.874 --> 04:11.209
What the fuck are you?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.393
<i>Evelyn!</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:36.192
-This can't be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.572
So, what's it been?
Like, seven years?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.200
Seventeen.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.702
Wow.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.704
Seriously?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.544
You've been locked down here
this whole time?

04:54.627 --> 04:59.632
I mean, not always, like,
exactly here in this spot, but locked up?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.593
<i>Yeah. It's for my own good.</i>

05:02.677 --> 05:03.886
Oh, you didn't know?

05:06.431 --> 05:07.849
I thought you were dead.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.269
Mom can't kill me. She needs me.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.187
Don't…

05:13.271 --> 05:14.772
Don't call her that.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.232
Sorry.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.110
So where have they been keeping you?

05:22.864 --> 05:23.948
Bert, I…

05:25.658 --> 05:26.993
I haven't been locked up.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.496
What do you mean?

05:30.580 --> 05:31.706
I got out.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.834
I made a life for myself.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.795
Oh…

05:40.423 --> 05:41.591
Good for you, man.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.926
I wish I could've
taken you with me. It's just…

05:44.010 --> 05:46.554
No, I… Yeah, I get it.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.394
My life…

05:54.228 --> 05:55.646
It's not so great.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.398
Ah, you get used to it.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.571
Have you ever tried to escape?

06:04.238 --> 06:05.823
No, why?

06:05.907 --> 06:06.949
You think I should?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.621
Bert, I need your help.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.956
-My daughters…
-"Daughters"?

06:15.374 --> 06:16.876
You've got… Holy cow.

06:18.669 --> 06:19.837
What are their names?

06:20.671 --> 06:25.134
Jade and Billie. They're just kids, 14.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.762
And you know what Umbrella
will do to them if--

06:28.763 --> 06:30.556
-Hands behind your back. Do it now!
-No. Wait.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.974
-Hey, I--
-Leave him alone!

06:33.726 --> 06:35.144
Hey! Stop!

06:37.438 --> 06:39.273
Don't worry. I got you, bro!

07:40.001 --> 07:41.043
Go.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.673
-Is Bea okay?

07:46.757 --> 07:49.427
Yeah, she's… She's fine.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.389
What were you thinking?

07:56.684 --> 07:58.311
I don't know.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.398
I'm sorry.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.446
You were right.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.616
I never should have left.
I should have stayed with you.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.202
Look, it doesn't matter.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.786
It does.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.789
What do you want me to say, Jade?

08:18.873 --> 08:21.250
Well, tell me I'm just stupid.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.169
Tell me I'm selfish. Tell me that I…

08:26.214 --> 08:28.090
That I got Amrita killed.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.142
You did.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.437
All those things, you did.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.857
Right now, Umbrella's here, Jade.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.069
What's happening?

08:49.153 --> 08:50.738
They wanna have a meeting.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.781
With Saqim.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.158
It's a trap.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.286
If we find out what they want,
maybe we can make a deal.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.372
Umbrella doesn't make deals.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.418
Arjun.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.383
We have to press the button.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.552
No.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.888
No, absolutely not. We're not there yet.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.056
Then fine. I'll go.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.809
-You just said it was a trap.
-Yes, exactly.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.936
I'll go if it means that you
can get Bea and everybody else

09:22.019 --> 09:23.187
on this ship somewhere safe.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.606
Bea doesn't need a martyr, all right?
She needs her mother.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.360
Who's asking for this meeting?

09:29.986 --> 09:30.987
Evelyn Marcus.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.592
-Thank you for meeting me.
-Your guns.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.011
This is a diplomatic mission.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.804
I am not armed,
it wouldn't be appropriate.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.932
He's clean.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.851
Follow me.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.350
Saqim Salam!

10:42.892 --> 10:43.976
Clear the tent.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.813
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.274
-Mrs. Marcus.
-Evelyn.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.779
Ah, we met before, uh,
when you spoke in Riyadh in 2019.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.489
Small world.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.159
Can I offer you a glass of champagne?

11:00.868 --> 11:02.995
Mm. I don't drink anymore.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.705
I don't drink any less.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.460
-Feels like I'm meeting a celebrity.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.296
The University hiding on a ship.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.548
Smart.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.468
I want Jade Wesker.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.597
She's a member of our community.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.848
A valued member?

11:23.432 --> 11:26.727
-All members have value.
-Of course. Let me rephrase.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.189
Is Jade Wesker valuable enough
to put the lives of your people in danger?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.275
Aw, Evelyn.

11:34.693 --> 11:40.074
I understand you have, uh,
many troops with many guns,

11:40.157 --> 11:44.036
and I understand you might see
my people as… academics.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.289
Oxford dons in their tweeds and tassels.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.624
I do love a good tassel.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.878
But believe me when I say
we have weapons of our own.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.048
We are also in possession of a hard drive

11:56.132 --> 11:59.760
taken from an Umbrella facility
in Bali in 2022.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.973
The contents of which I am sure
Umbrella would not want exposed.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.061
Saqim, I… I'm gonna make this
very simple for you.

12:09.812 --> 12:13.232
You can threaten me all you want,
but all those troops and all those guns,

12:13.315 --> 12:15.067
they're still gonna board your ship.

12:15.151 --> 12:15.985
Yes, but--

12:16.068 --> 12:19.113
And I'm sure there's some
very nasty things on that hard drive,

12:19.196 --> 12:22.950
and I'm sure you've got someone ready
to broadcast them to the world. So…

12:24.326 --> 12:26.662
Go ahead. Maybe it'll ruin us.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.373
But you and all your people?
You'll never know.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.292
Because unless I get what I want,

12:31.375 --> 12:34.503
I'm gonna turn your little fucking
love boat into the Titanic.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.213
Understand?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.852
So we've had some time to…

12:53.606 --> 12:55.274
…calm down.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.651
Take some…

12:58.444 --> 13:00.362
cleansing breaths.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.448
Hmm?

13:02.531 --> 13:04.033
I know what you want, Evelyn.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.495
This isn't the way to get it.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.164
I'm afraid both our hands are tied.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.710
That reporter, we ran his blood.

13:15.503 --> 13:21.383
Turns out, you gave him a dose of Joy
that's three times the lethal limit.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.721
-Do you want to tell me why?
-You can't do this.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.390
-And I won't help you.
-Sure you will.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.851
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be playing grab-ass

13:30.935 --> 13:33.187
with Tweedledee and Tweedledum
in that rathole.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.272
I didn't ask for your help.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.194
But you took it, didn't you?

13:40.778 --> 13:45.032
You begged me to get out of that cell,
and I'm just a big softie, I guess,

13:45.115 --> 13:46.742
because I took pity on you.

13:47.368 --> 13:53.582
The deal was, you do what I ask,
and, in exchange, I let you have a life.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.876
And I let you create life.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.965
So why are you making my life
so difficult?

14:01.757 --> 14:02.716
And Bert?

14:03.842 --> 14:05.761
What kind of a deal did you make with him?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.848
Is he the one
who's been changing Joy's formula?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.643
Jesus, Evelyn. He's unstable.

15:02.776 --> 15:03.903
Is it Dad?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.030
Simon.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.032
-Ignore him.
-I am.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.744
What about you? Anything?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.165
When do we start to worry?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.047
Now?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.049
<i>I trusted you.</i>

15:25.716 --> 15:28.218
I convinced myself you were different.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.553
Special.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.306
That it would be interesting
to see if a clone could acclimate

15:32.389 --> 15:34.183
to the real world.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.268
You fooled a lot of people, Al.

15:37.478 --> 15:43.692
-But if we can get Joy--
-That's all you care about?

15:43.776 --> 15:46.153
The next product juicing the stock price?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.447
People have died!

15:48.530 --> 15:52.701
And more people could be saved!
Just fucking think about it!

15:53.661 --> 15:57.957
Depression, anxiety, suicide. Just…

15:58.832 --> 15:59.833
gone!

16:01.001 --> 16:01.961
That's…

16:03.379 --> 16:05.130
Fuck the bottom line.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.717
That's changing the world. Come on, Al.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.971
Don't you want to change
the world with me?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.057
Like you care.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.483
I bet everything on this.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.696
My job, my reputation, my marriage.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.699
Everything.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.202
I care.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.917
So even if you don't,
you're gonna help me.

16:44.294 --> 16:47.047
Bert's notes. Get to work.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.053
Hey, sweetie. Yeah, just here with Albert.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.514
He says hi.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.475
Yeah.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.608
Mom?

17:08.736 --> 17:09.695
Bea?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.367
I snuck out.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.703
What's happening? Amrita.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.580
-She's--
-I know.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.294
-You said it would be okay.
-I know.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.755
I need you to be strong, okay?

17:29.798 --> 17:32.009
Bea, I need you to go to our cabin.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.969
Okay? I need you to go to my bed.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.180
Look under it. There's a green duffel bag.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.556
Why?

17:38.182 --> 17:39.725
It has everything you'll need.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.353
I need you and Dad to get off the ship.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.773
Why?

17:49.068 --> 17:51.904
Because the people out there
are bad people.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.280
They want to hurt you.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.200
-Dad says--
-Yeah, look, I know what Dad says.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.243
But he doesn't know them like I do.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.829
Bea, you have to believe me.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.047
And if Dad won't go with you,
I need you to go on your own.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.132
What?

18:13.550 --> 18:14.468
What about you?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.308
I'll be right behind you.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.480
Bea…

18:28.899 --> 18:30.901
I'm so sorry for all of this.

18:32.653 --> 18:37.074
I never wanted any of this for you.
I just wanted you to be safe and happy.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.330
But I need you to do this for me, okay?

18:44.706 --> 18:45.666
You promise me.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.586
I promise.

18:59.596 --> 19:00.514
Anything?

19:02.683 --> 19:03.767
Still no.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.686
I mean, what if we never hear from him?

19:05.769 --> 19:07.020
Then we call the police.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.106
-The Umbrella police?
-Jade.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.066
Hey, I've been texting you.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.202
That's our dad.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.164
-But can we just talk--
-I'm sorry.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.208
Who's car is this?

19:28.917 --> 19:32.379
Uh-oh, I… decided to upgrade my wheels.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.006
But only the best for…

19:35.465 --> 19:36.717
my girls.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.679
What happened?

19:41.388 --> 19:42.389
At Umbrella?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.601
You know, work, work, work.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.685
How was school?

19:47.978 --> 19:49.521
Did you see "him"?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.108
Oh, yeah, I saw him.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.444
Okay, and what happened?

19:57.070 --> 19:58.780
Um, we'll, we'll talk about it later.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.158
Hey, mate!
You're blocking the pick-up lane!

20:01.241 --> 20:02.367
Come on! Move it!

20:02.868 --> 20:04.411
What's their problem?

20:04.494 --> 20:06.038
You're blocking the pick-up lane.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.333
You can't just leave
your car parked there!

20:10.751 --> 20:12.628
Move it already! Come on!

20:16.131 --> 20:17.299
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

20:21.887 --> 20:22.846
Dad.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.514
This puppy's got some oomph, huh?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.683
Billie, put your seatbelt on.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.362
You ever get tired
of taking orders from her?

20:38.445 --> 20:39.738
Nah, I'm a masochist.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.120
-How is he?
-So far, so good.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.085
You need your medicine.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.629
I can get it for you.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.050
How long can you go without?

21:01.885 --> 21:04.221
Right now, you're being the strong hero,

21:04.304 --> 21:07.266
because that's
what you think you are, but…

21:08.475 --> 21:11.645
…I'm guessing that in about an hour,
maybe less,

21:12.562 --> 21:15.148
the pain will become unbearable,
and you'll give in.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.401
You don't know me.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.987
I've known every version of you, Al.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.198
And you Weskers,
you're all about one thing.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.158
Self-preservation.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.913
I mean, why clone yourself
unless you want to live forever?

21:32.457 --> 21:33.792
It's starting, isn't it?

21:33.875 --> 21:38.505
This is exactly why we abandoned
the cloning program years ago.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.008
After a certain point,
the maintenance is too damn high.

21:42.467 --> 21:47.347
Hell, Bert needs dialysis most nights,
a drug cocktail, just to wake up,

21:47.431 --> 21:51.310
and even then, for every good day,
he's got ten bad ones.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.654
Your cells are breaking down.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.534
You're falling apart from the inside out.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.916
Here.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.134
Welcome to Olive Garden.
When you're here, you're family.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.719
Right this way, please.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.180
So much pasta.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.307
No olives, though. Weird.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.225
Did they bug the car?

22:32.309 --> 22:33.852
What? Who?

22:33.935 --> 22:36.021
Umbrella. Were they listening?

22:37.397 --> 22:38.565
Oh, my God.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.319
Unlimited breadsticks.
Are you seeing this?

22:42.944 --> 22:45.614
-Do they know about me?
-This is the best day.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.531
Hey!

22:47.783 --> 22:50.577
Put the fucking menu down.

22:55.707 --> 22:56.917
Dad, your finger.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.836
Everything's fine.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.755
Let's just order.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.050
We have to go to the bathroom.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.809
Sorry.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.149
-Something's wrong.
-You think?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.943
What if Umbrella did something to him?

23:23.026 --> 23:24.861
Like what? Cut off his fucking finger?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.863
And drugged him
or hooked him up to electrodes

23:26.947 --> 23:28.365
and shocked the shit out of him?

23:28.448 --> 23:30.242
-Gave him a brain transplant?
-Right.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.994
Okay.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.581
Let's think.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.838
Dinner's in 15.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.925
Let me guess, is it salmon again?
Can you cook something with legs, maybe?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.261
You're in a mood. What's wrong?

23:49.344 --> 23:50.303
Nothing's wrong.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.682
-I don't know.
-You don't know what?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.935
It's just, I have these friends and…

23:57.519 --> 24:01.064
I'm actually quite worried about them,
but they're just ghosting me,

24:01.148 --> 24:02.440
and I don't know what to do.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.195
I can tell you what you don't do.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.534
You don't get mad,
and you don't give up on them.

24:13.076 --> 24:15.036
When they need your help,
they'll ask for it.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.497
And if they don't,
you'll offer it to them anyway.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.168
Honey…

24:21.251 --> 24:22.544
I'm home.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.713
Dinner's almost ready.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.884
-It's your favorite.
-Mm. I'll open the wine, then.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.803
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, kid.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.098
-What you doing?

24:35.182 --> 24:36.224
What?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.893
-What is it?
-It's this new filter.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.979
You put up to your face, and it shows you
what type of breakfast food you are,

24:41.062 --> 24:44.816
and Mark got cottage cheese
and apple sauce, and he's super pissed.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.610
Do it to me.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.361
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.699
-What?
-Hilarious.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.202
-What? What am I? Show me.
-Beans on toast.

24:55.285 --> 24:58.330
No. I'm a carb? No!

24:58.413 --> 24:59.915
You and Mom, you're just…

25:00.790 --> 25:02.375
You seem different.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.501
"Different"?

25:03.585 --> 25:04.544
Well, it's just…

25:05.212 --> 25:06.671
she was so mad when you were gone.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.758
Thought I'd start getting
two Christmases, you know?

25:09.841 --> 25:11.551
Well, I'm back now.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.179
She says that you work too much.

25:14.846 --> 25:15.764
She's right.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.391
So stop.

25:19.851 --> 25:20.685
I can't.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.187
Not right now.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.173
Just a second.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.976
-Here.
-Thank you.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.319
-Do you have him?
-<i>He didn't come home.</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:13.446
<i>Should I initiate tracking protocols?</i>

26:14.239 --> 26:17.951
-How long will that take?
-<i>Twenty. Thirty minutes, tops.</i>

26:20.662 --> 26:21.788
I'll call you back.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.377
-Simon?
-Hmm?

26:30.046 --> 26:31.840
Can you text your friend, Jade?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.676
Uh, why?

26:35.927 --> 26:39.347
I need to know where she is.
I'm afraid she may be in trouble.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.411
These are legit.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.955
Excuse me. More breadsticks.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.541
-Looks like you still have a few left.
-Oh, no.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.211
This is my unlimited basket.
They need their unlimited baskets.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.088
I'm sorry, sir. It's one per table.

27:12.172 --> 27:15.425
-But that's a limit.
-Dad, it's no big deal.

27:15.508 --> 27:17.802
It is a big deal
because it's not unlimited.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.512
As soon as you finish your basket, I can--

27:19.596 --> 27:20.805
You know what? Fine.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.225
-There. Finished.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.397
You girls want one of my sticks
while we wait?

27:30.523 --> 27:31.816
What is wrong with you?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.361
What? Nothing.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.155
-We'll talk about it when we get home.
-No.

27:37.822 --> 27:38.698
Now.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.537
I'm not your dad.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.707
I'm your uncle.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.459
Bert.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.547
Wait, he, he… he never mentioned me?

27:55.173 --> 27:56.383
So you're like, what?

27:57.592 --> 27:59.010
His twin?

27:59.094 --> 28:00.762
Sort of. We're clones.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.808
"Clones"?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.518
There was a third one of us, Alby,

28:06.601 --> 28:09.687
but he was killed
by the original Albert Wesker.

28:09.771 --> 28:10.647
Our creator.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.856
"Creator."

28:11.940 --> 28:14.067
We were part of, like,
a research and development team

28:14.150 --> 28:15.318
he put together to help him.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.195
He died in a volcano.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.780
It's okay, though. He wasn't very nice.

28:19.739 --> 28:20.782
Didn't like me much.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.534
But don't worry.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.494
Me and your dad, we're nothing like him.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.788
I mean, genetically,
were exactly like him.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.665
But everything else, totally different.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.584
I mean, he was a monster.
He liked hurting people.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.089
But I think we've all got
these feelings inside us, right?

28:36.673 --> 28:38.383
Happy feelings, sad feelings, and…

28:40.176 --> 28:46.725
…feelings like sometimes you just want
to punch someone in the face so hard.

28:49.853 --> 28:53.148
Well, anyways,
I think we all have a choice.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.525
We can choose who we are. Who we wanna be.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.653
And I choose… breadsticks.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.620
Stay the fuck away from us.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.456
What?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.751
If you don't, we'll scream.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.753
But… But I…

29:17.422 --> 29:19.090
-Jade, what?
-I don't know.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.508
-Umbrella.
-Oh, shit.

29:26.806 --> 29:27.849
In the back.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.435
Okay. Come on. Go. Come on.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.231
-Girls! Get behind me!
-Oh, my God.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.191
Bert?

29:40.361 --> 29:41.488
Shit.

29:42.071 --> 29:44.240
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Come on.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.378
Hey!

30:13.311 --> 30:15.730
Don't worry. Everything's A-okay.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.898
Okay.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.044
Come to papa.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.969
Playtime's over, Bert.

30:46.761 --> 30:48.054
I don't like you!

30:48.137 --> 30:49.264
You're not nice to me!

30:50.431 --> 30:52.600
-Let me go!
-Hey! Don't touch us!

30:53.601 --> 30:54.853
-Let them go.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.231
It's all right. I work with your dad.

30:58.314 --> 30:59.190
That wasn't him.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.568
Don't worry! Everything's gonna be fine.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.735
We know.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.070
Where is he?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.030
Waiting for you. Just come with me.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.116
No.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.454
This isn't really a "no" situation.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.933
Okay. As soon as you
hand me over, get back to the ship

32:15.016 --> 32:16.309
and spin up the engines.

32:17.393 --> 32:19.729
And press that fucking button, okay?

32:19.812 --> 32:20.772
Jade.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.859
Oh, no, no.
You are not taking her anywhere!

32:29.364 --> 32:32.283
Look. I know you feel like--

32:32.367 --> 32:33.368
Arjun.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.786
It's okay.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.747
I love you.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.208
But I've got to do this.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.669
Wait, Jade. Jade!

32:55.223 --> 32:56.265
Jade.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.392
Thank God.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.896
That's Simon's mom.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.482
And, Billie, you must be terrified.

33:04.565 --> 33:05.900
That horrible man.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.444
He said he was a clone.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.738
-Is that true?
-Because if it is…

33:11.823 --> 33:13.032
that's fucking insane.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.745
Yeah. Well, fucking insane
is kind of what we do, so…

33:19.038 --> 33:19.956
Look.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.502
I know you girls have questions.

33:24.585 --> 33:28.089
That wave of fear and confusion
you're feeling right now, I've felt that.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.758
Never really knew my father.

33:30.842 --> 33:35.596
He… he was a very brilliant,
very private man.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.391
To protect me,
I was kept in the dark about things.

33:38.474 --> 33:40.268
Things he thought I couldn't handle.

33:41.019 --> 33:41.894
But…

33:42.478 --> 33:47.817
us girls, we're tougher and smarter
than people give us credit for.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.904
Aren't we? Hmm? Hmm?

33:52.488 --> 33:53.781
Now, let's go see your dad.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.004
Al, you've got company.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.425
-Dad…

34:13.342 --> 34:15.386
What's wrong? What did you do to him?

34:15.470 --> 34:16.679
-Hey, hey!
-Get off! Hey

34:16.763 --> 34:17.847
-Get off!
-Don't touch her!

34:17.930 --> 34:19.265
-Hey, stop! Stop!
-Hey, don't touch her!

34:19.348 --> 34:20.683
Stop, please!

34:20.767 --> 34:22.477
No!

34:23.644 --> 34:26.564
I wish there was a more elegant way
to do this, too, girls.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.823
Take your medicine, Albert.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.076
What's happening?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.119
Do you want
to tell them or should I?

34:41.287 --> 34:42.371
Okay, I'll do it.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.293
Your father's dying.

34:48.586 --> 34:52.673
Like good ol' Bert told you,
he's a clone, which… Weird, sure.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.969
But really, it's a very simple process
involving a little DNA,

34:57.053 --> 35:00.139
a few empty cells,
and a very unfortunate woman.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.559
But being a clone
isn't your father's problem.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.269
The rapid aging is.

35:05.853 --> 35:10.858
See, Wesker,
OG Wesker was an impatient man.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.903
He's cloned himself
a little army of geniuses,

35:13.986 --> 35:16.072
and he wasn't gonna wait
for them to grow up.

35:16.155 --> 35:22.078
So, with our good friend science,
your father went from born to 20 years old

35:22.161 --> 35:24.455
in less than six months.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.959
But accelerating the cells
that way leads to…

35:28.626 --> 35:29.752
problems.

35:29.836 --> 35:36.551
Cancer, mitochondrial explosion,
all sorts of nasty things.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.929
Your father's sick. So he invented a cure.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.057
You.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.143
What?

35:45.226 --> 35:47.854
He engineered your blood
to fix his problem,

35:47.937 --> 35:50.648
which, like I said, he's a genius.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.733
That's not true.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.776
Isn't it?

35:58.865 --> 35:59.991
I…

36:39.071 --> 36:41.741
I, I didn't… I, I can explain.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.451
That's…

36:44.869 --> 36:46.662
That's why you were taking our blood.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.540
-Billie, please.
-Stop. Just stop!

36:51.626 --> 36:52.835
I don't know what you are.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.088
But everything you say is a lie.

36:57.298 --> 37:02.094
And all that stuff about making us strong
and protecting us…

37:04.138 --> 37:05.765
It was all bullshit!

37:11.187 --> 37:12.438
I hope…

37:13.522 --> 37:15.900
you fucking die.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.917
Evelyn, if you do anything to hurt them…

37:33.501 --> 37:35.920
Al, I'm not that person.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.883
But you did say you'd do anything.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.469
Time to prove it.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.153
You brought a gun this time.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.281
Good for you.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.376
Alone.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.328
Who's there?

39:00.254 --> 39:01.881
-Evelyn?

39:27.615 --> 39:29.283
She's good, huh?

39:31.243 --> 39:32.953
Yeah, this thing controls
the electrodes in her brain

39:33.037 --> 39:34.622
and pumps her full of 87 different drugs.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.582
-Wanna see her do a backflip?
-No.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.544
Come on.
That whole show and that's all I get?

39:40.628 --> 39:42.463
Just an angry, little, "No"?

39:42.546 --> 39:46.342
I knew you set me up
the second I found that tracker.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.136
You got me to lead you here
because I am fucking stupid.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.972
You're Jade. You did the Jade thing.

39:52.056 --> 39:55.393
You go after what you want
and everything else, it's noise.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.020
So what? You're controlling Evelyn?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.565
Which means you're running Umbrella.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.693
Little bit. But I've made
a few enemies over the years.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.488
So, uh, best to keep the bitch around.
Right, E?

40:16.455 --> 40:17.748
I know what you're thinking.

40:18.624 --> 40:19.583
I look good.

40:23.003 --> 40:25.589
So, in France,
when you said you were sick,

40:26.882 --> 40:28.342
you were doing the Billie thing.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.052
Lying.

40:31.345 --> 40:32.304
No.

40:32.805 --> 40:37.852
No, my blood's bad.
But turns out, yours is still good.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.312
Yeah, fixed me right up.
Just like it did Dad.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.231
Oh, come on.

40:42.314 --> 40:45.276
We're Weskers.
Self-preservation is what we do.

40:45.359 --> 40:46.694
What do you want, Billie?

40:50.322 --> 40:52.658
-I just want my sister.
-Oh, fuck off of that shit.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.827
Baby, you already fucked me.
I'm just fucking you back.

40:55.953 --> 40:56.787
You left.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.206
So much for "together forever." Right?

40:59.832 --> 41:00.875
I didn't have a choice.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.088
Someone once told us,
we all get to choose.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.091
Who we are, who we want to be.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.676
You chose.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.720
Okay, fine. Fine.

41:12.803 --> 41:16.891
You got me. Here I am.
Just let everyone else go.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.352
You think this is all about you?
Wow, narcissist.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.395
Oh, my…

41:21.979 --> 41:24.148
No, I want everything.

41:24.231 --> 41:27.026
Every artifact, every painting, all of it.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.613
The University's made it their mission
to preserve the past,

41:30.696 --> 41:31.655
and that is a problem.

41:33.282 --> 41:36.827
Bad things happened in the past.
You know, you were there.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.497
You don't have to do this, Billie.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.042
Do you like your memories, Jade?

41:44.335 --> 41:45.628
'Cause I don't.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.089
That is why
I'm building a better future.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.799
Making the world a better place.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.260
You hear yourself?

41:54.637 --> 41:57.431
I mean, you even sound like her.
Who's controlling who?

42:00.559 --> 42:01.560
Malloy!

42:05.105 --> 42:06.273
Take the ship.

42:07.983 --> 42:10.319
No. Wait, wait! Hey! Ow!

42:12.905 --> 42:15.115
-I won't let you do this.
-Really?

42:16.992 --> 42:18.077
Fine.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.359
Well, that was dramatic.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.415
What's that?

43:09.628 --> 43:11.505
Contact!

44:03.307 --> 44:05.351
-It's happening.
-Don't move.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.030
Jade.

44:57.861 --> 45:02.324
Let go of the fucking lines!
Quick! Untie them! Get on it!

45:02.408 --> 45:03.742
Let go of the lines! Now!

45:04.618 --> 45:05.786
Move it!

45:05.869 --> 45:08.747
Hurry up! Hurry up! Quick!

45:08.831 --> 45:09.832
No, no, no, no.

45:52.291 --> 45:53.625
Stop this.

46:20.652 --> 46:27.159
<i>In a fast-changing world,
don't you deserve some Joy?</i>

46:38.045 --> 46:41.298
