I Just Got Fired Because
<I>You</I> Went Crying To Your Boss.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.800
You're Late.
Take Off Your Clothes.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.600
Ha Ha. Easy, Sailor.
Buy A Girl A Drink First

00:10.600 --> 00:12.700
If You Had Told Me
That I Would End Up

00:12.700 --> 00:15.400
At Your Apartment,
I Would Not Have Believed You.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.300
The Bradford Meade-
Wilhelmina Slater Weddin

00:18.300 --> 00:19.900
Is Back On.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.400
I Lost Atlantic Attire.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.800
He Was Protectinme.
Don't Defend Him.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.300
I Know You're Leaving
In Five Months,

00:25.300 --> 00:28.000
And I Know That I'm
Gonna Get My Heart Broken,

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
But Maybe It's Worth It,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.600
As Long As We Keep
Our Relationship Secret.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:42.000 --> 00:42.700

00:45.900 --> 00:48.500
Hurry, <I>Mija,</I> Into The Kitchen.
Betty, Come On.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.400
What Are We Doing?
This Was Hilda's First Week
At The Beauty Salon...

00:51.400 --> 00:52.900
Oh.
So We're Surprising Her.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.200
Uh, But I Was Gonna Go
To The Movies.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.700
You're Going To
The Movies Alone?

00:56.700 --> 00:59.300
Betty, You Can't Keep Moping
Over This Henry Thing.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.200
You Need To Be
With Your Family...

01:01.200 --> 01:03.100
And Food.
No. You Know What, Dad?

01:03.100 --> 01:04.500
You Can't Keep Tempting Me
With Food.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.700
It's Not
Gonna Work Anymore.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.800
(Singsongy Voice)
I Made Carne Asada.

01:09.400 --> 01:09.500
Just One Bite.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.500
(Whispers) Hurry.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.900
(Betty, Ignacio And Justin)
Surprise!

01:16.900 --> 01:20.300
There She Is,
Queeof The...

01:20.300 --> 01:22.600
Hairstylist... To The Stars.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.000
I Should've
Worked On This.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh, Stop.
It's Just A Job.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.300
No Biggie, Okay?

01:28.300 --> 01:31.300
No Biggie? Hilda,
You're Following Your Dream.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.000
We Are So Proud
Of You, <I>Mija.</I>
Oh.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.100
Forget Dreams. Tell Me About
The Bumble And Bumble Salon.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.900
I Heard One Time
Beyonc?Went In There To Get

01:38.900 --> 01:41.100
Her Weave Tightened, But Fergie
Wanted The Appointment,

01:41.100 --> 01:43.000
So She
Totally Bitch-Slapped Her.
Hey.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.800
What? There's
No Other Word For It.
I Think What Justin

01:45.800 --> 01:49.100
Is That We're All Very Excited
About Your New Job.
We Are.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.900
Oh, Come On, You Guys.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.600
You Know, I Don't Like To Be
The Center Of Attention.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Okay, I Love You.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.500
Congratulations.
My Movie Starts At 7:00.
You're Going To A Movie?

02:00.500 --> 02:01.500
Uh-Huh.
Alone.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.700
Why Don't We All Go?

02:02.700 --> 02:04.300
"Project Runway's"
A Rerun Tonight.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.300
Yeah, I Can Pack Up
The Carne Asada.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.000
Oh, Yeah, Betty.
Get Your Big Purse.
No!

02:09.500 --> 02:11.600
Uh, No.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.000
Dad Made
This Beautiful Dinner.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.100
We Should Stay.
Forget About The Movie.

02:18.100 --> 02:22.000
Um, I'm Gonna
Go Hang My Coat.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.500
Okay.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.000
(Whispering) Henry.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.600
(Henry Whispering) Betty.
Henry.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.700
Bey.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.600
Oh, Uh, I Can't Go.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.000
I Know.
Your Family's Really Loud.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.600
I'm Sorry. They Just...
They Don't Want Me To Be Alone.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.000
(Normal Voice) Monday Daniel
Didn't Want You To Be Alone,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.100
And On Tuesday, Christina
Didn't Want You To Be Alone.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.100
Shh.
(Normal Voice) I Know.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.400
They're Just--They're Trying
To Help Me Get Over You.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.100
We See Less Of Each Other Now
Than We Did

02:48.100 --> 02:49.700
Before We Were Going Out.
(Ignacio Laughs)

02:49.700 --> 02:54.100
Wouldn't It Just Be Easier
To Tell Them The Truth?
No. No, We Can't.??

02:54.100 --> 02:56.300
We're Doing Something
Really Stupid, Henry.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.900
You're Leaving For Tucson
In Five Months,

02:57.900 --> 02:59.200
And I Don't Need Them
Telling Me

02:59.200 --> 03:01.100
??

03:01.100 --> 03:03.200
ok...

03:03.400 --> 03:06.300
you are right???

03:06.700 --> 03:08.000
i miss you??

03:08.100 --> 03:10.300
I'm Here Now.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.200
(Hilda) Betty!

03:13.200 --> 03:15.200
Hide!
Aah. Oh!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.300
(Clattering)
Oh.

03:17.900 --> 03:18.900
Come Inside.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.800
<I>Papi</I> Unscrewed
The Good Wine.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.000
(Whispers) I'm Sorry.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.700
I Gotta Go. I'm Sorry.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.400
(Christina) Ugh!

03:36.400 --> 03:39.200
Just Got The Designer Swimwear
For The Preview Issue,

03:39.200 --> 03:41.400
And, Once Again,
Summer Is Not Going To Be Kind

03:41.400 --> 03:43.300
To The Big Girls.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.400
Hello?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.700
This Aects Both Of Us,
You Know. Look At That.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.800
Come On.
Christina, I Gotta
Ask You Something.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.600
You Know How Sometimes You Say
You're Not Gonna Have A Drink,

03:52.600 --> 03:55.700
But Secretly, You've Got
This Great Bottle Of Alcohol,

03:55.700 --> 03:58.200
Like--
Like A 20-Year-Old Bourbon.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.700
No, No, No, No, Better.
A Single Malt Whiskey.
Yeah.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.500
No--Or Just Like Maybe
An Iced Cold Bottle Ofeer--

04:02.500 --> 04:04.600
Oh, Okay, It Doesn't Matter.
You've Got This Booze,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.000
And You Can't
Tell Anyone About It

04:06.000 --> 04:08.200
Because They Know
It's Bad For You.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.600
But All You Can Think About
Is Going Home And Drinking

04:10.600 --> 04:12.800
And Drinking--
What Is This,
A Bloody Intervention?

04:12.800 --> 04:16.300
Because I Can Give Up
Whenever I Want.
No, No. This Has Nothing??

04:16.300 --> 04:17.300
??

04:17.300 --> 04:20.100
Okay, Let's Start Over. Uh, Say
You Have A Dozen Doughnuts And--

04:20.100 --> 04:22.000
Christina, I Have
Your Budget Approvals.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.400
Oh, Betty.
Henry.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.700
I Have To Go.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.100
Oh, My God.
<I>He's</I> Your Doughnuts.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.100
Yes.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.200
And He's Delicious,
And I Can't Tell Anyone.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.100
But, Betty, He's Got
Charlie And The Baby,

04:44.100 --> 04:46.200
And He's Leaving,
And It's Crazy.
Shh.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.300
But It's Ao Very Hot.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.500
Oh, But You Could Get
Your Heart Broken.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.700
Yeah, But Who Cares?
It's Also Hot, Hot.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.100
I Know,
But It--It's Wrong.
Or Is It Right?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.500
Either Way, We Have
To Keep It A Secret.
Secret Romance,

04:57.500 --> 05:00.800
But That Means We Never
Get To See Each Other.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.000
We Haven't Even...

05:02.000 --> 05:04.700
Ooh, Ooh, Cold, Cold.
I Know.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.500
Okay, So You Wanna
Keep It Secret?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.100
Use Me
As Your Cover Tonight, Okay?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.300
But You've Gotta Take
That Doughnut,

05:09.300 --> 05:12.000
And You've Got To Bite It
And Dunk It In Your Coffee

05:12.000 --> 05:14.700
And Get It Hot, Warm And Wet,
And Then... (Grunts)

05:14.700 --> 05:17.600
Bite Into It Again
And--Oh, God, I Need A Drink.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.000
I Ne A Doughnut.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.500
(Bradford) This Is Unbelievable,
Daniel.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.800
I Told You, Atlantic Attire
Said I Had To Let Go Of Alexis

05:27.800 --> 05:29.500
Or They Would Pull
Their Advertising.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.200
What Was I Supposed To Do,
Fire Her?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.600
Take Her Name Off
The Masthead For Three Months.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.400
Then You Offer This Guy
Six Issues

05:35.400 --> 05:37.700
At Half Our Normal Rate--
Basic Business.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.500
I Guess I Didn't Think--
You Didn't Think.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.000
You Just Told Him To Take
His Business Elsewhere.
Okay, Guys. It Happened.

05:43.000 --> 05:43.600
Why Don't We Try

05:43.600 --> 05:45.800
And Get Some Big Players
In For The Next Issue?

05:45.800 --> 05:46.600
When I Was At Hudson,

05:46.600 --> 05:49.300
I Had Some Great Contacts
At Ralph Lauren.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.400
Yeah, I Mean, I Know Some People
In Ralph Lauren, Too.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.000
You've Done Enough.
Alexis Will Take Care Of It.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.100
Oh!
(Betty) Whoa.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.800
Hei hei Hello.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.600
Gio, Hi.
What Are You Doing Here?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.800
Phase One Of Giovanni Rossi's
5-Year Plan.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.600
I Rented Out
The Little Sandwich Kiosk

06:11.600 --> 06:14.100
Down In The Lobby.
Oh, That's Great.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.900
And Because You Got Me Canned
From My Old Job,

06:16.900 --> 06:20.700
Which Lit A Re
Under Me... Three Coupons.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.400
Ah, A Free Cookie.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.200
But You Know What?
You Did Geme Canned,

06:24.200 --> 06:27.200
So Let's Make It Two.
You're Welcome.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.500
"Coming Soon--
Gio'sandwiches." Hmm.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.400
What's With The Face?

06:31.400 --> 06:35.000
Well, No, It...
It's Just A Littlery.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.500
Maybe You Could Try
Something Catchy.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.400
Oh, Like That Doughnut Shop
Downstairs.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.900
"A <I>Hole</I> Lotta Fun."
That Just Makes Me Smile.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.500
Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.100
That's Also The Name Of
A Strip Club In Bayside.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.700
Ew, And Now
I Know You Better.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.700
So You Make Sandwiches.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.100
How About Calling It, Uh...
"On A Roll"?

06:51.100 --> 06:52.700
Oh, No, Wait--
"Hero Worship"!

06:52.700 --> 06:54.100
And You Could Have
A Little Cartoon Sandwich

06:54.100 --> 06:55.500
Who Flexes His Muscles.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.700
I Already Have 500 Flyers
That Say "Gio's Sandwiches"

06:58.700 --> 07:03.100
And... A Pickle
With A Smiley Face.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.300
Well, Th's Good, Too.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.400
Oh, Uh, Excuse Me,
But Think About It.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.600
Okay.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.400
Daniel, So How Was
Your Meeting With Your Father?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.000
The Usual. Alexis Is
Gonna Save The Magazine.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.900
Daniel Is A Dumb-Ass Trying Not
To Trip Over His Own Shoes.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.800
(Bradford Laughs) Daniel...
(Alexis Laughs)

07:22.800 --> 07:25.600
Well, You N't Keep Letting
What Your Father Says About--

07:25.600 --> 07:28.200
It's Okay, Betty.
I Actually Have A Plan.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.100
You Do?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.100
Try Not To Be
So Skeptical.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.900
I Actually Need
You To Call Ad Sales.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.400
Get All Of Their Leads.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.500
Alexis Isn't The Only One
Who Can Save This Place.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
I'm Gonna Go Find Us
An Advertiser.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.400
Damn It.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.300
Hey, Party In The Village
Last Night.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.000
You Will Not Believe
Whose Boob Popped Out.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.500
Oh, Need To Know. Not Now.
We're At Code Fuchsia.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.000
(Gasps) You Got
Someone Pregnant?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.600
Oh, That's Code Never.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.400
Wilhelmina's Daughter
Nico Called.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.100
She's Not Coming
To The Wedding.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.900
(Gasps)
Oh, My God.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.200
Dot Worry.
I Am Your Friend,

08:05.200 --> 08:08.300
And I Will Be Here For You
Noatter What.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.700
(Wilhelmina) Someone's
Getting Fired Today.
(Amanda Gasps)

08:10.700 --> 08:13.000
Oh, Is Daniel Calling Me?
I Think I Have To Go. Bye.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.900
Wilhelmina Slater, Everyone.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.900
How Was Your Dress Fitting?
Disastrous.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.000
I Haven't Eaten In 10 Days
And I Overshot My Target Weight.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
My Custom Vera Wang Makes Me
Look Like A White Silk Shar-Pei.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
And That Diva Wang Said

08:27.000 --> 08:29.100
There Wasn't Enough Time
To Alter The Boning.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.799
Oh, What Does Wang Know
About Boning, Anyway?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.900
(Gasps) Oh.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.600
Stop. Meatbread.
Stop It.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.100
Stop It.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.900
I Have To Gain 6 Pounds
By Saturday To Fill It Out.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.900
Oh.
(Sighs) Look At Her.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.700
She Makes It Seem
So Easy.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.300
Hang On.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.400
(Sniffs) I Smell Fear.
What Did You Do Wrong?

08:56.400 --> 08:59.400
Oh, Willie, Wrong Is Really
A Matter Of Perception.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.100
You See, Sometimes In Life,
We Have To--Aah!

09:02.200 --> 09:03.300
Nico Got Bit
By Her Pet Monkey,

09:03.300 --> 09:04.400
And She's Fine,
But She's Quarantined

09:04.400 --> 09:06.300
And She Can't Make It
Tohe Wedding.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.200
Terrific. Now I Have To Redo
The Seating Charts Again.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.300
Um, Isn't She Also
Your Maid Of Honor?

09:14.300 --> 09:15.800
Oh, Marc.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.900
I Have Flower Problems
And Catering Problems,

09:18.900 --> 09:21.600
And Bradford Wants Something
Called A "Shania Twain"

09:21.600 --> 09:23.500
To Perform At Our Reception.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.200
I Have Way Bigger Issues.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.300
Find Out What Betty
Is Having For Lunch

09:29.300 --> 09:32.200
And... Order Me Two.

Oh, Hello, Accountant.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.000
Oh, Hello,
Daniel's Assistant.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.100
I Just Need Your Signature
Right Here On That--Oops.

09:46.100 --> 09:46.300
Oh.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.400
I Opped It.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
So, Look, Um...
I Was Feeling Really Bad

09:53.200 --> 09:54.800
About E Fact That
I Haven't Made Time For You,

09:54.800 --> 09:58.200
And I Was Thinking Maybe Tonight
We Could Have A Real Date?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.100
What Do You Have In Mind?

09:59.100 --> 10:00.600
Well, We Never Got To See
"Wicked" Last Year

10:00.600 --> 10:04.000
Like We Wanted.
"Wicked"? Wicked Awesome.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.800
And Then, Maybe Afterward,
The Date Could Continue?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.000
(Objects Clatter)
Ow.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.300
Yeah, Yeah.
That Could Be Good.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.700
I Mean, Whatever.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.200
(Daniel) Bet?
(Bell Dings)

10:18.200 --> 10:19.600
Oh.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.700
There Is
Nothing Going On.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.100
He Was Just Signing
Some Papers Under The Desk.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.300
We Always Do It That Way.
I'm Protecting Your Privacy.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.700
Are You Forgetting
How Crushed You Were

10:33.700 --> 10:35.000
When He Left You
The First Time?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.800
Daniel,
I Am Not Dating Henry.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.900
Because If You Were, I'd Have To
Seriously Think About

10:39.900 --> 10:43.000
Getting Rid Of Him.
Murder?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.300
What? No. God,
I Hate That It's So Easy

10:45.300 --> 10:47.900
To Go There With My Family.
No, I Mean Fire Him.

10:47.900 --> 10:51.600
I'm Not Gonna Let Him
Break Your Heart Twice, Betty.
You'd Actually Do That?

10:51.600 --> 10:54.000
Come On, Betty.
You Butt Into My Life

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
All E Time
Because You Care About Me.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.400
Like It Or Not,
I Care About You, Too.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.200
Well, U Have Nothing
To Worry About.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.600
Will You Please Hide
Your Mutt?

11:05.600 --> 11:06.500
If Wilhelmina Sees It,

11:06.500 --> 11:08.600
She's Gonna Melt Cheese
On It And Eat It.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.700
Hey, You.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.300

Halsn, That's Prada!

11:15.100 --> 11:15.800
Hey, Bud.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.200

Your Friend, Amanda, Right?

11:18.200 --> 11:20.500
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.

My Wittle Marc-Y Marc.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.500
Ew, I Thought We Talked
About That Voice.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.200
You Were Gonna Retire It
And Move It To Florida.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.400
When We're Not
Eating At My Place.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.500

11:35.500 --> 11:39.800

12:13.000 --> 12:14.900

12:14.900 --> 12:18.000

"Mama Mia."

12:18.100 --> 12:20.200
Well, Becae "Wicked" Means
Something Really Special

12:20.200 --> 12:23.700
To The Boy I'm Dating,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.700

13:23.300 --> 13:25.300
I Knew The Maid Of Honor Thing
Would Hit You Eventually,

13:25.300 --> 13:28.300
But I Have An Idea--
We'll Video Conference Nico,

13:28.300 --> 13:31.200
That Way She Can--
This Is Not About Nico.
Look.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.200
Chocolates. Disastrous.
Why Again?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.700
These Are The Favors

This Is Unacceptable.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.000
What Do We Want?
Integrated Chocolates.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
When Do We Want Them?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
(Sighs) If I Want
Anything Done Right,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.400
I Have To Plan It Myself.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.400
Get Me The Seating Chart.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.700
Willie, You Can't Do This

Hey, Why Don't I Stay
With You Tonight

14:08.100 --> 14:10.400
And Help You Get

14:10.900 --> 14:12.600
However Long It Takes.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.400

15:17.300 --> 15:20.600
Nice Try, Hillary.
The Merman's A Collector's Item.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.800
One Day, It'll Pay
For My College Tuition

15:22.800 --> 15:24.700
Or Send Me

15:25.200 --> 15:27.600
Hey, Guys.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.400
<I>Hello. (Laughs)</I>

16:03.300 --> 16:06.100
Okay.

So Did Amanda Give You
Those Tickets To "Wicked"?
Oh, Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.200

He Seemed Pretty Excited.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.600
So I'm Just Curis,

16:35.600 --> 16:39.800
Being Your Boyiend And All,
Am I A Gentle Lover?
Ew. Shut Up.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.600
I Had To Tell My Boss
I Was Going Out With Someone,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.200
And You Were
The First Guy I Saw.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.500
Flattered.
Why Are You Lying To Him?

16:45.500 --> 16:48.400
Because, Well, I--

16:48.400 --> 16:50.700
I'm Dating Someone That I Don't
Want Daniel To Know About.

16:50.700 --> 16:54.100
Ooh, You're Cheating On Me
After I Was So Gentle?

16:54.100 --> 16:57.400
Stop It. Can I Just
Have My Tickets, Please?
First Tell Me??

16:57.400 --> 16:58.800
No.
Tell Me Who You're Dating.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.200
Why Don't You Just
Get Your Own Life?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.700
Please?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.099
Okay, Henry From Accounting.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.800
(Sighs) Okay...
He Got A Girl Pregnant,

17:18.800 --> 17:21.300
And I Don't Want Daniel
To Know That I'm Dating Him,

17:21.300 --> 17:21.900
Because If He Does,

17:21.900 --> 17:23.500
He's Just Gonna Tell Me
That I'm Being Stupid.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.700
Wow.
You Are Being Stupid.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.400
You're A Very Rude
Fake Boyfriend.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.200
Now Can I Have
My Tickets, Please?

17:30.700 --> 17:33.000
Uh, No.
Uh, The Other One, Too.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I Need To Be Prepared In Case
Daniel Asks Me About The Show.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.600
What? Are You Kidding?
Hey, He Gave Them
To Both Of Us, Oy?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.000
You Do What U Want
With Yours,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.200
And I'm Gonna Do
What I Want With Mine.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.400
Well, I'm Not Gonna
Go With <I>You.</I>

17:46.600 --> 17:49.900

18:25.900 --> 18:28.600
Please, I--I'll Do
Anything You Want.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.000
Why Are You
Smiling Like That?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.500
I Was Just Picturing You
Walking Halston For A Month.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.300
Okay.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.900

18:57.500 --> 19:00.000
(Laughs) Hello?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.300
I Just Hope There's
Still A Magazine

19:01.300 --> 19:04.800
When The Time Comes
To Print A Swimsuit Issue.
What Are You Talking About?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.600
I Lost
A Bunch Of Advertisers,

19:06.600 --> 19:09.200
And I Thought I Had A Shot
At Landing Prada,

19:09.200 --> 19:10.900
But I Just--I Blew It.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.900

19:20.900 --> 19:23.600
Four Words--
San-Dra Win-Throp.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.700
When You Say "Four Words,"
You Mean "Syllables"?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
She Owns
Some Jewelry Company.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.400

19:33.700 --> 19:34.900

19:34.900 --> 19:37.000
To Try To Get Her

To Put Her Feet Up

19:59.600 --> 20:01.200
And Watch Some "Extra."

20:01.500 --> 20:03.800
I Read On The Internet
That Madonna Came In Today.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.000
Oh, Yeah, Sure.

Really There.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.400
What Is Going On
With You?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.600
No, What's Going On
With You?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.700
My Friend Duncan's Father
Says, "Hi."

20:21.700 --> 20:24.600
Or Should I Say,
"Hi-Ems"?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.700
Oh, Crap.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.900
What Happened
To Bumble And Bumble?

20:32.900 --> 20:35.000
Okay, Look.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.300
Maybe I Offered
Some Constructive <I>Suggestions</I>

20:39.300 --> 20:40.900
To One
Of The Stylists There.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.700

It's Like He Ate Your Type.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.300
Okay, But What You Don't Know
Is That He's Really Sweet.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.700
He Wrote Me A Poem And Left It
On My Bathroom Mirror.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.500
He Met Tyrese At
A Photo Shoot

28:55.500 --> 28:57.200
And Got Him To Call Me
On My Cell Phone.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.100
And Sometimes, He Does
This Thing Where He Pretends

29:00.100 --> 29:01.900
Like His Belly Button Is
A Mouth, And He Puts On

29:01.900 --> 29:03.900
A Little Puppet Show For Me,
And He Calls Him Mr. Gutley.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.500
(Deepens Voice) "Hello,
I'm Mr. Gutley."

29:06.700 --> 29:08.200

29:11.500 --> 29:13.900
(Normal Voice) Oh,

29:14.200 --> 29:17.400
I Never Liked
A Guy Like Cliff. Oh!

29:17.700 --> 29:20.200
What Do I Do? Let Him Go Just
Because He Doesn't Use Product?

29:20.200 --> 29:21.900
Cliff Or Mr. Guty?

29:21.900 --> 29:25.200
Oh, That Stupid Belly Button

29:30.500 --> 29:33.700
I Don't Wanna End Up Sad

Are You Sure?

30:37.500 --> 30:41.300
I Guess E... Reason
Why I Was Putting Off

30:41.300 --> 30:43.400
Finding Another
Maid Of Honor

30:44.500 --> 30:48.700
Was Because I Hoped That
Nico Would Change Her Mind.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.500
But Apparently
She Hates Me.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.700
She Doesn't Hate You.

30:52.700 --> 30:55.600
Oh, Marc, Monkey Bite?

30:57.700 --> 30:59.300
But You're Wrong
About Me Being Alone.

Two-Faced, Superficial Friends

31:02.500 --> 31:03.800

31:03.800 --> 31:05.300

Of This Wedding.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.100
Any Of Them Would Be Thrilled
To Be My Maid Of Honor.

Oh, Marc,
I Forgot To Ask.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.200
Who Are You Bringing
To The Wedding?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.900

31:26.200 --> 31:29.700
Well, We Wouldn't Want You
To End Up Sad And Alone.

31:34.300 --> 31:37.000

Give That Girl A Raise.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.000
Uh, Sandra...

34:05.400 --> 34:06.000
I Can't.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.400
Well, Then Don't
Give Her A Raise.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.100
Everyone Gets So Touchy
About Money.

34:09.100 --> 34:13.199
No, No, No, No. I... Sandra,
You're Beautiful. I Just...

34:13.600 --> 34:17.000
I Can't Seduce You To Get
You To Buy Ads In Our Magazine.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.699
I'm Not Letting You
Seduce Me For My Ads.

34:19.699 --> 34:22.400
I'm Letting You Seduce Me
Ause You Got A Great Ass.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.600

34:23.600 --> 34:26.300
Well, I Have Added Squats
To My Workout Lately.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.699
All Right, Putting The Sex Aside
For A Minute,
Oh.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.500
What Do I Have To Do
To Get Your Advertising?

34:31.500 --> 34:34.000
Well, Why Should I
Move Over From "Glamour"?

34:35.500 --> 34:40.800
Well, Winthrop Jewelry's Revenue
Has Dropped 15%

34:40.800 --> 34:43.000
In The Last Quarter Alone,
Righ

34:43.000 --> 34:45.300

34:47.300 --> 34:50.300

34:56.400 --> 34:58.800
"Mod Has Always Stayed
In Mode.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.000

Of That One, Huh?
A Little.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.100
Well, You Actually Made
Some Good Points.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.300

35:07.800 --> 35:10.600
Maybe We Should, Uh,
Go Out And Celebrate, Huh?

35:10.600 --> 35:13.900
You're A Smart Guy, Daniel,
And That Tush Is Darling,

35:13.900 --> 35:16.300
But Frankly, Smart Guys
Are A Turn-Off.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.400
(Gulps)
Should I Be Insulted?

35:38.300 --> 35:39.700
That Door's Gotta Be

In Here?

35:51.800 --> 35:54.500
You Know What?
Who Cares?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.800
This Is The First Time
We've Been Alone All Night.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.400
What Was That?
I Don't Care.

36:11.100 --> 36:11.800
Whoa.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.000

36:47.800 --> 36:48.900
Ay, Okay, We're Going.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.400
I Can't Believe They Banned Us
From "Wicked" For Life.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.300
I Can't Believe
Daniel Saw Us.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.400
He Knows About Us.
We're Screwed.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.400
Betty, Betty, Calm Down.
We'll Figure Ts All Out.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.600
Let's Just Get
Out Of Here, Okay?

36:59.600 --> 37:02.600
Uh, Wait--Wait, Um,
I Forgot My Purse And My Coat.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600

A Cab And I'll Meet You?

37:04.600 --> 37:05.700
Yeah, Yeah. Okay.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.300

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And You Can Totally
Manipulate My Life,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.400
But I Can't Keep
Pretending Anymore.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.700
You're Gonna Get
Your Heart Broken.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.800
It's My Heart.
What Does That Mean?

37:41.800 --> 37:43.900

37:43.900 --> 37:45.000

38:19.100 --> 38:20.300

But I Don't Think
I Can Do This...

38:25.400 --> 38:26.000

Wow, Betty.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.400
I Know, And Please Just
Don't Tell Me How Stupid I Am.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.200
One More Minute With Santos,

39:11.200 --> 39:12.400
Do You Think
