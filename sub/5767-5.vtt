00:04.830 --> 00:08.630
DIANE:
This is about a plane crash.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.104
A Hammett GR—6 carrying

00:11.140 --> 00:15.429
35 passengers and five crew.

00:15.480 --> 00:19.109
All 40 dead.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.675
Many of their widows
and widowers are here today.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.245
And all want to know one thing.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.579
Why did this plane just drop
from the slq?

00:28.620 --> 00:30.281
Like Kyle Lidtke.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.551
He lost his wife
and two daughters in this crash.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.068
Now, the CEO
of Hammett Aerospace

00:37.100 --> 00:40.536
would have him believe
it's the pilot's fault,

00:40.570 --> 00:41.798
and not their plane.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.831
But we ask you to reject

00:43.870 --> 00:47.431
this cynical,
blame-the-victim defense,

00:47.480 --> 00:51.541
because this is
a very Simple case of...

00:51.580 --> 00:53.571
...a flawed airplane design.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.609
My co-counsel, Ms. Lockhart,

00:57.650 --> 01:00.312
represents the families
of the passengers.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.783
I represent the families
of the crew.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.185
But we decided
to combine our lawsuits

01:05.230 --> 01:08.358
because we agree on one thing.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.563
Hammett Aerospace

01:11.600 --> 01:15.138
put a jet into service
that they knew was defective.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.832
How do we know this?

01:17.870 --> 01:21.203
How do we know that they knew
their jet was defective?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.877
Because there is
a very brave whistleblower

01:24.910 --> 01:27.470
from within Hammett

01:27.520 --> 01:30.887
who's agreed to testify for us.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.478
(gunshot)

01:32.520 --> 01:35.455
Damn.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.152
Not to sound too cynical,
but this could be a good thing.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.729
Guilt-ridden
whistle-blower

01:45.770 --> 01:48.591
testifying from
beyond the grave?

01:48.640 --> 01:51.905
They didn't do a great job
cross-examining in the depo.

01:51.940 --> 01:56.604
And it's_ hard
to cross-examine a corpse.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.469
The problem was in the wings.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.819
_ _DIA_NE: _
The de-Icmg In the wrngs?
Yes.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.489
It was a system of tubes
that distributed fluid

02:02.520 --> 02:04.511
to de-ice the wings
during flight.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.814
Not bad.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.816
We admit this
Into evrdence.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.328
And avoid further
cross-examination.
Yup.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.351
Falling forward.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.721
Well, that's the problem.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.897
She's a great tutor.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.795
Grace's physics grades

02:20.840 --> 02:21.795
are the best this year.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.738
And where did you find her?

02:22.770 --> 02:24.806
The tutor Eli suggested her.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.899
And Grace is friends
with her now?

02:28.680 --> 02:29.772
Who, Grace or the tutor?

02:29.810 --> 02:31.300
The tutor.

02:31.350 --> 02:34.171
Well, I can find some tutor
referrals around here.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.278
No, that's okay.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.618
Let me handle it with
a flyswatter, not a bazooka.

02:37.650 --> 02:40.881
I didn't think I was handling it

02:40.920 --> 02:41.852
with a bazooka.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.881
(knocking)

02:43.930 --> 02:45.579
Uh, okay, we'll talk.

02:45.630 --> 02:46.824
I got to go.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.498
Yes, sir.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.623
David Lee's here.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.433
We need more
conference room space.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.631
I'm like an itinerant
farmer out here.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.729
WILL:
So, Alicia,

02:56.770 --> 02:58.761
David and I head up
the hiring committee,

02:58.810 --> 03:01.370
and we've decided the firm needs
a new first-year assoaate.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.775
So we want you
to interview and hire someone.

03:02.810 --> 03:05.643
Really?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.238
These are the new graduates

03:07.280 --> 03:09.817
from U of C.
See who you like.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.819
You want me _
to do the actual hIrIng?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.555
In consultation
with the committee.

03:14.590 --> 03:16.956
And you'll be mentoring him,
too, so choose well.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.821
Or her.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.851
Oh, Alicia, uh, I need

03:20.900 --> 03:23.892
to talk to you a minute
about the Cole divorce, hmm?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.761
Thank you for this.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.631
No, not me. David.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.900
I'm still supposed
to be tense with you, remember?

03:31.940 --> 03:35.398
And by the way,
I know how Celeste works.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.341
Don't worry about it.
No, she thrives on chaos.

03:38.380 --> 03:41.417
She'll say a lot of things about
me just to see how you react.

03:41.450 --> 03:43.941
Then I won't react.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.580
DAVID:
So,

03:49.630 --> 03:51.882
we can't use "Cole divorce"
as our cover word anymore

03:51.930 --> 03:53.488
because I actually
have a Cole divorce.

03:53.530 --> 03:54.952
Oh. Well, we don't need
a cover word.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.319
I'm still undecided about it.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.827
Ah, yes, the fiction
of separation.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.690
You're putting your kids

04:00.740 --> 04:02.537
in private school?

04:02.570 --> 04:04.902
New item in your
financial journal.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.771
I'm thinking of it, yes.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.505
That's $35,000 to 50 a year.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.599
I know.
My advice is, you don't.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.311
Thank you, but I'm fine.

04:12.350 --> 04:13.476
No, you don't
understand.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.669
I'm not your
accountant.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.779
You can overspend on
anything you like, but

04:16.820 --> 04:18.515
you need to get your husband
to pay half.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.949
I... Why?

04:19.990 --> 04:21.981
To preserve
your dependency.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.829
You pay that amount on your own,

04:23.860 --> 04:25.953
you lose your best argument
against spousal maintenance.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.299
Well, I'm not asking Peter
for spousal maintenance.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.558
No, not you. Him.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.989
(laughs)

04:32.030 --> 04:34.362
Hey, don't blame me.
You guys wanted equal treatment.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.594
Thank Gloria Steinem.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.937
Peter makes less

04:36.970 --> 04:38.608
in the State's Attorney office
than you.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.834
He could come after you
for support.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.804
Peter's not coming after me
for support.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.648
Alicia, he'll come after you
for everything.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.739
No, he wants the governorship.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.578
That's what Eli's plotting
over there right now.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.939
Give him the keynote.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.810
(laughs)

04:53.860 --> 04:55.612
Are you kidding?

04:55.660 --> 04:56.957
At the Democratic Convention?

04:56.990 --> 04:58.878
Peter has the
best story.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.898
He went to prison
on a trumped-up charge,

05:00.930 --> 05:02.864
fought it, and made it back
into office.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.492
It's a story of rebirth.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.497
Eli, he's a state's attorney.

05:05.530 --> 05:06.690
And Obama was

05:06.740 --> 05:08.696
a state senator
when he got the keynote.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.560
And a black man.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.329
Who is it?

05:13.380 --> 05:14.699
Who's what?

05:14.740 --> 05:15.934
Who are you championing?

05:15.980 --> 05:18.346
You must have somebody already.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.018
(sighs)

05:20.050 --> 05:21.517
Adam Spellman.

05:21.550 --> 05:24.018
Oh, come on!

05:24.050 --> 05:26.518
No to the State's Attorney,
but yes to a dogcatcher?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.709
He's not a dogcatcher.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.988
He's a strong businessman
with...

05:29.020 --> 05:30.351
You think that's

05:30.390 --> 05:32.028
what America wants
to see up on that dais?

05:32.060 --> 05:33.755
Eli, it's already in the works.
We're pushing Spellman.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.893
Don't worry about it.

05:35.930 --> 05:38.069
Peter Florrick's marriage
is his secret weapon,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.034
not some keynote address.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.766
So, how is she doing?

05:45.940 --> 05:49.068
They knew the de-icing fluid
tended to freeze

05:49.110 --> 05:50.702
in the wing lines,

05:50.750 --> 05:52.775
but they decided to save money

05:52.820 --> 05:54.742
and do nothing about it.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.680
We move to introduce
this deposition

05:56.720 --> 05:58.017
into evidence, Your Honor.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.915
And we object, Your
Honor. It's hearsay.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.622
We can't cross-examine
a corpse.
Really, Mr. Roda?

06:02.660 --> 06:04.059
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Inelegantly put.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.991
But I can't
cross-examine
the deceased.

06:07.030 --> 06:07.928
DIANE:
Your Honor, Rule 212

06:07.960 --> 06:09.689
expressly permits the use

06:09.730 --> 06:11.618
of a recorded deposition
when a witness dies.

06:11.670 --> 06:13.831
But only if the court, in
its discretion, determines

06:13.870 --> 06:15.167
it wo_n't_do a _
substantial Injustice,

06:15.200 --> 06:17.100
such as in the case of perjury.

06:17.140 --> 06:19.802
Which is why, in the current
matter, I would direct

06:19.840 --> 06:22.400
the court's attention to
Mr. Ritter's suicide note.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.600
It consists of two lines.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.709
"It's a lie.
I'm sorry."

06:26.750 --> 06:28.809
Your Honor, Mr. Ritter's wife
was claiming

06:28.850 --> 06:30.738
he slept with
their 16-year-old baby-sitter.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.143
The note refers to that.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.259
We don't know that.

06:33.290 --> 06:35.952
He could be referring
to his testimony in this trial.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.821
At the very least,
the meaning is unclear.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.179
Unclear?
Oh, really?
Are you serious?

06:39.230 --> 06:40.754
I'm not prepared to
interpret the law...

06:40.800 --> 06:43.018
(overlapping chatter)

06:43.070 --> 06:44.594
You can all
wear yourselves down.

06:44.630 --> 06:45.790
Tell me when you're ready.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.159
What do we do now?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.565
We have other options.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.736
Like what?

06:50.770 --> 06:51.998
We'll _ask
for a continuance.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.837
We still have
our expert Witnesses.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.199
You thought they weren't enough.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.879
Hold them
accountable,

06:57.910 --> 07:01.641
please... for my wife
and daughters.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.641
Kalinda, what are you doing?

07:05.690 --> 07:07.681
Um, Eli business.
What do you need?

07:09.020 --> 07:11.022
Yeah, I'm already on it.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.225
Yeah?

07:14.260 --> 07:16.524
Adam Spellman--
do you know who that is?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.891
Adam Spellman.
A businessman.

07:18.930 --> 07:20.830
Head of the Chicago
Black Leadership Council.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.838
Yeah, I need you
to look into him.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.132
Look?
As in, find dirt.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.035
Why?

07:26.070 --> 07:28.106
He's the likely
keynote speaker at the next

07:28.140 --> 07:30.176
Democratic Convention, and if
he has a skeleton in his closet,

07:30.210 --> 07:31.700
I do not want him blowing up

07:31.750 --> 07:33.115
in the face
of the Democratic Committee.

07:33.150 --> 07:35.038
Really? How selfless of you.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.048
Yeah, well,
I'm a caring individual.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.785
Mm.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.185
I need it quick.

07:40.220 --> 07:42.051
Yeah. Everybody needs it quick.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.128
Ah.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.991
That was quick.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.055
It was a blind CC.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.024
Ritter e-mailed the CEO
about the de-icing problems,

07:52.070 --> 07:53.867
and on Ritter's copy,

07:53.900 --> 07:57.165
there were only two e-mail
addresses included in the CC.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.998
But on the CEO's copy,
he BCC'd someone else.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.577
CS at HeralquuityGroup?
Who's that?

08:05.980 --> 08:06.947
Oh, no.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.514
What?

08:07.550 --> 08:08.869
He's a client of ours

08:08.920 --> 08:09.887
from two years ago.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.138
He was the venture capitalist
on their IPO.

08:12.190 --> 08:13.612
CEO kept him in the loop.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.878
(sighs)
Great.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.785
What?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.286
Well, he's not the most
dependable of witnesses.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.025
He might not even talk to us.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.527
He won't.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.788
Call Alicia.

08:24.830 --> 08:25.694
Why?

08:25.730 --> 08:27.231
He'll talk to her.

08:27.270 --> 08:29.261
(indistinct chatter
and voice over PA system)

08:39.010 --> 08:40.773
(buzzer sounding)

08:40.820 --> 08:44.119
Here I didn't think we'd get
a chance to work together.

08:44.150 --> 08:47.119
See? Isn't this fun?

08:47.160 --> 08:50.027
So, you and I should
get some drinks,

08:50.060 --> 08:52.153
trade whore stories.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.726
Horror?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.751
Yeah. What did I say?

08:57.130 --> 08:59.792
He's not allowed to touch you,
or hand you anything.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.604
There's a panic button at the
table if there's any problems.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.767
That's not his style.
How much does he know?

09:04.810 --> 09:07.176
Nothing. I thought
I'd let you broach it.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.201
Just like Clarice
Starling, huh?

09:19.620 --> 09:23.021
Mrs. Florrick, what a pleasure.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.599
You seem well.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.835
Oh, under the circumstances,

09:41.880 --> 09:43.939
I, uh, do the best I can.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.743
(humming)

09:45.780 --> 09:47.668
You have a tattoo, I see.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.914
What?

09:48.950 --> 09:51.248
Oh. Oh, yeah.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.757
Oh, this...
oh, this old thing?

09:52.790 --> 09:54.610
I wanted William Blake's

09:54.660 --> 09:56.059
The Ancient of Days,

09:56.090 --> 09:58.650
but beggars really
can't be choosers here.

09:58.690 --> 10:02.251
And you, Mrs. Florrick--
I imagine you're well?

10:02.300 --> 10:05.326
Your husband's
back in office,

10:05.370 --> 10:07.133
you're thriving in
your profession.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.638
The world must be your oyster.

10:09.670 --> 10:12.161
I would say the grass
is always greener, but...

10:12.210 --> 10:13.871
(laughing):
Yes.

10:13.910 --> 10:17.869
Although, there's a refreshing
honesty to prison.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.219
People don't dissemble here,
they just take.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.210
My firm needs your help,
Mr. Sweeney.

10:25.250 --> 10:29.789
So, that's it for small talk?

10:29.830 --> 10:32.082
We're suing a company--
Hammett Aerospace.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.290
There was a plane crash.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.252
The Dorset crash, yes, I know.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.666
You were the financier
on their IPO.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.692
We had a witness who
knew there was a problem

10:40.740 --> 10:42.799
with the de-icing system
on the plane

10:42.840 --> 10:44.000
but he committed suicide.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.268
Oh, dear.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.198
Yes.

10:47.240 --> 10:51.301
Anyway, he was testifying
to a meeting you attended.

10:51.350 --> 10:55.013
And you were wondering if
I might testify in his stead?

10:55.050 --> 10:56.984
Yes.
Why me?

10:57.020 --> 10:58.749
Why not O.J.?

10:58.790 --> 11:00.678
Won't the jury be
likely to mistrust

11:00.720 --> 11:02.881
the word of a renowned
wife-killer?

11:02.930 --> 11:04.352
You were never convicted.

11:04.390 --> 11:05.288
(chuckles):
Oh, yes.

11:05.330 --> 11:09.096
One of those fine
distinctions in the law.

11:09.130 --> 11:12.930
Imprisoned on something
I didn't even do.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.892
I hate irony.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.329
I heard America's
irony-free these days.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.361
Yes, it's been outlawed.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.435
(chuckles)

11:25.480 --> 11:28.176
I like you, Alicia.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.245
Why don't you like me?

11:31.290 --> 11:33.349
You killed your wife.

11:33.390 --> 11:36.450
And there's nothing
I can do about that?

11:40.230 --> 11:41.390
Testify.

11:41.430 --> 11:44.422
Would that help you?

11:44.470 --> 11:47.030
It would help 40 families
suing Hammett Aerospace.

11:47.070 --> 11:49.959
Yes, and I'm sure
they're all adorable, but...

11:50.010 --> 11:51.363
will it help you?

11:54.810 --> 11:56.038
Yes.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.072
Then, of course, I'll help.

11:59.110 --> 12:01.476
(loud rock music playing)

12:04.350 --> 12:06.489
(rock music continues)

12:08.490 --> 12:11.288
Oh, thank you
for waiting.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.457
(panting):
Work.

12:15.260 --> 12:18.320
Um... I think you're doing
a great job as a tutor.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.894
Ijust...

12:19.940 --> 12:22.363
Do you, um, want something?
You want a latte or...

12:22.400 --> 12:23.799
Oh, no.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.105
So, these... videos,

12:27.140 --> 12:28.505
um, that you make,

12:28.540 --> 12:30.804
these dance videos, um,

12:30.850 --> 12:32.977
they're just...

12:36.580 --> 12:38.389
How old are you, Jennifer?

12:38.420 --> 12:40.809
I'm 22.
And...

12:40.860 --> 12:42.179
you and Grace
have become friends?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.154
Yes.
And these, um,

12:44.190 --> 12:47.057
dance... videos, uh,

12:47.100 --> 12:48.499
are f...

12:48.530 --> 12:50.395
um, what are they for?

12:51.830 --> 12:53.388
The Internet.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.395
Uh-huh.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.203
You make money off of them?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.003
No.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.871
You just do them?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.172
Yes.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.303
I don't understand.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.970
I like doing them.

13:11.390 --> 13:15.087
Okay. Um, Jennifer, I...

13:15.120 --> 13:18.283
I just want you to be a tutor.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.424
Okay? I-I want you
to work with Grace
on her homework.

13:21.460 --> 13:24.327
I don't want Grace making
these videos with you anymore.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.034
Okay.

13:28.070 --> 13:31.005
Is that it?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.302
Yes.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.148
ELI:
Oh, my God,

13:45.190 --> 13:46.282
you're good!

13:46.320 --> 13:47.355
Thanks.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.358
So, Adam Spellman,

13:49.390 --> 13:51.881
a Democrat,
really gave money

13:51.930 --> 13:53.921
to support the Defense
of Marriage Act?

13:53.960 --> 13:55.450
His wife did-- she's
a devout Baptist,

13:55.500 --> 13:57.468
and knew it would
be a problem.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.593
That's why the money
came through her company.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.394
And then they tried
to hide it. (laughs)

14:02.440 --> 14:05.204
I mean, I think this
is good that the DNC

14:05.240 --> 14:07.572
knows this now, long
before the convention.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.602
Yeah. That's very
selfless of you.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.539
Okay, I need you to look
into these other names

14:13.580 --> 14:15.013
they're considering for keynote.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.518
They may get
in the way.
In the way of what?

14:17.550 --> 14:18.380
Peter Florrick.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.882
I didn't know this was
for Peter Florrick.

14:21.920 --> 14:25.321
Oh, don't worry, I'll pay
out of my own pocket.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.998
The list.

14:28.530 --> 14:30.623
No. But thanks, though.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.594
What's wrong?
Nothing. I have

14:33.640 --> 14:35.631
other work.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.511
Thank you for
coming in, Caitlin.
No,

14:50.550 --> 14:52.347
thank you--
this is so cool.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.153
Um, a very
impressive resume.

14:54.190 --> 14:57.956
You did a summer
at Wyler & Wolf in New York.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.322
So why us?
Well, in a word,

15:00.360 --> 15:02.555
Hﬁgaﬁon.
Transactional's fine,

15:02.600 --> 15:04.488
but litigation is what
really turns me on.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.638
And the University of Chicago.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.558
What turned you on there?

15:10.610 --> 15:11.702
Moot court.

15:11.740 --> 15:15.198
It was an opportunity
to dig deep into an area of law

15:15.240 --> 15:17.640
but still keep my feet
grounded in something real.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.069
And did you win?
Well, my partner
and I did.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.212
It was a team effort.

15:21.250 --> 15:25.209
I can work on my own,
but I love being part of a team.

15:29.414 --> 15:29.460
So, your summer at Wyler,
did you a offer, or...?

15:29.460 --> 15:32.486
No. They had a hiring freeze.
The economy.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.249
But I would rather
be here, anyway.
Just an odd question,

15:35.300 --> 15:38.189
it's a question they asked me
when I first interviewed here.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.595
What's your favorite hobby?

15:39.630 --> 15:41.530
Well, I'm embarrassed
to say it.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.300
(laughs):
Oh, come on, Martha,
let's hear it.

15:44.340 --> 15:45.659
What was your hobby?
No, no,

15:45.710 --> 15:48.201
no, no-- I'm the one
asking the questions here.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.676
Okay. I like foreign movies,
old movies,

15:51.710 --> 15:53.575
like Truffaut and Godard.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.612
Tramp-boarding.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.581
Um...

15:58.620 --> 16:00.451
wh-what's that?

16:00.490 --> 16:02.549
Skateboarding on
a trampoline,

16:02.590 --> 16:04.023
without wheels.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.381
I know.
(laughs)

16:06.430 --> 16:09.251
But I can do a double somersault
from a full-blown ollie.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.699
To be honest,

16:10.730 --> 16:13.699
I've had an offer
from Canning & Meyers.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.493
But I really do
want to work here.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.566
I like the family spirit.
Well, if you
could hold off

16:19.610 --> 16:22.579
Canning & Meyers, we can
get back to you in a few days.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.544
That's great.
Thank you, Alicia.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.741
(knocking)

16:26.780 --> 16:28.668
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:28.720 --> 16:31.211
you will now hear testimony
from a convict

16:31.250 --> 16:33.411
housed at_the Pine Creek
Penitentiary.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.280
Under agreement
between the attorneys,

16:35.320 --> 16:36.651
the questioning
will be conducted

16:36.690 --> 16:38.578
via closed-circuit video.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.493
How's my hair?

16:41.530 --> 16:43.088
ALICIA:
It's fine.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.325
Y-You might
want to cover...

16:45.370 --> 16:47.497
Mm...
So are we
clear on

16:47.540 --> 16:49.269
what you say?
I am to answer

16:49.300 --> 16:51.131
honestly and
completely.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.137
Yes,

16:52.170 --> 16:53.034
but not too completely.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.275
Just keep your answers
short and on point.

16:55.310 --> 16:56.299
How long?

16:58.450 --> 16:59.576
Something...

16:59.610 --> 17:01.510
about you two.

17:01.550 --> 17:04.110
Some kind of tension there.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.640
What is it?

17:05.690 --> 17:07.180
Are you gonna tell him?

17:07.220 --> 17:10.781
I would like to just concentrate
on his testimony.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.298
Oh, come on,
you can't leave it like that.

17:13.330 --> 17:16.652
There won't be any testimony
unless you tell me what it is.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.292
We're lovers.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.407
We've been keeping it secret
for months. Alicia?

17:24.370 --> 17:27.305
I really don't want
to talk about it right now.

17:27.340 --> 17:31.470
She's breaking up with me for
a man who is not worthy of her.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.313
If only it were true.

17:35.350 --> 17:36.317
Mm.
GUARD:
Ready to go.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.443
(whispers):
Three, two, go.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.219
Short and
to the point.

17:41.490 --> 17:44.186
Hello, Mr. Sweeney.
Can you hear me?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.084
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.690
Good morning to you.
I understand you've
been sworn in.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.096
May I ask you a few questions?

17:51.130 --> 17:53.291
Yes. I've been
wonderfully prepped here

17:53.340 --> 17:56.639
by two of your
beautiful attorneys.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.468
DIANE:
Mr. Sweeney, can you tell us
how you became acquainted

17:59.510 --> 18:01.705
with Hammett Aerospace?

18:01.740 --> 18:02.877
Yes. I...

18:02.910 --> 18:05.470
uh, rather, my company--

18:05.510 --> 18:08.479
(sighs
my compa?ny—-

18:08.520 --> 18:12.889
was, uh... retained
to provide financing

18:12.920 --> 18:15.889
for their initial
public stock offering.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.387
How's that?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.318
DIANE:
And in that capacity,

18:19.360 --> 18:22.329
did you attend a meeting
at which Hammett executives

18:22.360 --> 18:25.466
discussed potential problems
with the GR-6?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.764
Uh, yes, um,

18:27.800 --> 18:29.438
I-I believe I did.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.835
And at this meeting,

18:30.870 --> 18:32.667
can you tell us
what was discussed

18:32.710 --> 18:34.575
regarding the de-icing system

18:34.610 --> 18:36.430
on the airplane?

18:36.480 --> 18:37.504
Um...

18:37.550 --> 18:39.677
the... I'm sorry, I-I...

18:39.710 --> 18:40.813
Uh, could you repeat the...

18:40.850 --> 18:42.215
At this meeting...

18:42.250 --> 18:44.343
We need to cut him off;
he's gonna hurt us.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.517
...the de-icing system

18:46.550 --> 18:47.517
on the airplane?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.710
JUDGE:
Mr. Sweeney, do you
need a moment?

18:49.760 --> 18:53.218
(laughs):
I don't... I don't know.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.395
Uh...

18:56.430 --> 18:59.888
Your Honor, I have to ask
for a brief continuance.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.831
Uh, clearly, my witness
is having health issues.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.269
Your witness is having
second thoughts.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.863
Mr. Sweeney,
what are you doing?

19:06.910 --> 19:08.309
What am I doing?

19:08.340 --> 19:09.773
I'm undercutting your case.

19:09.810 --> 19:10.845
Why?

19:10.880 --> 19:12.575
Because I want something.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.577
What?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.576
Freedom.

19:15.620 --> 19:18.509
He'll testify if we free him?

19:18.550 --> 19:21.451
With good behavior,
he's got two years
left on his sentence.

19:21.490 --> 19:24.459
He says that he has something
to offer the State's Attorney.

19:24.490 --> 19:26.481
Evidence _on
drugs in prison.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.591
I think I can find a way
to get around

19:31.630 --> 19:33.461
the private school
money situation.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.536
Hold on, Margie. Hold on.

19:35.570 --> 19:36.798
Well, thank you.
No problem.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.604
So, uh, how are the
interviews going?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.631
Great. I reinterviewed
my top two ch0ices,

19:41.680 --> 19:43.568
and I think
I've made a decision.

19:43.610 --> 19:46.943
Great. Isn't Caitlin fantastic?

19:48.620 --> 19:50.781
Caitlin?
Yes. Did she
tell you how much

19:50.820 --> 19:52.412
she loves competition?

19:52.450 --> 19:54.418
She did.
Do you know her?

19:54.460 --> 19:55.882
Yes. She's my niece.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.956
I told her not to mention
it because I didn't

19:57.990 --> 20:00.322
want her to win_ out
based on nepotism.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.588
I'm glad you liked her.

20:01.630 --> 20:04.428
Well, I did, um, but I...
What?!

20:04.470 --> 20:05.823
No! Oh, come on!

20:07.870 --> 20:09.497
(door opens)

20:09.540 --> 20:11.633
(door closes)

20:15.380 --> 20:17.871
Next time I'll get
some long benches in here.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.844
Colin Sweeney
wants to make a deal.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.441
Yes. I read your e-mail.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.344
Oh, yes.
Imani. Hello.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.982
Come on in,
come on in.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.488
This is Imani Stonehouse--
she's an AUSA

20:29.520 --> 20:30.623
assigned to our
office to review

20:30.660 --> 20:33.299
racial bias in sentencing,
and she keeps me honest

20:33.330 --> 20:34.820
with all
my plea bargains.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.748
Okay. So...

20:36.800 --> 20:39.360
our good friends
from Lockhart/Gardner...

20:39.400 --> 20:39.968
And Monty & Columbech.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.433
Yes.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.665
They have an offer
to make us in trade

20:43.710 --> 20:45.666
for releasing the wife-killer,
Colin Sweeney.

20:45.710 --> 20:46.961
DIANE: The
defensive killer

20:47.010 --> 20:48.329
of his stalker,
Colin Sweeney.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.938
And I'm sure Imani'll have

20:49.980 --> 20:52.005
something to say about that.
ALICIA:
Cary,

20:52.050 --> 20:53.642
you've seen
an increase

20:53.680 --> 20:55.318
in heroin distribution

20:55.350 --> 20:56.772
at the Cook County
prison complex.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.812
Mr. Sweeney
can tell you who

20:59.850 --> 21:01.556
and how, including guards.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.524
In trade for his freedom.
Yes.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.994
I don't think that's going
to fly, but thank you.

21:10.030 --> 21:11.691
DIANE:
Why don't you check
with your boss.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.665
Peter Florrick promised to fight
corruption in the prison system.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.565
This could go a long way
towards that.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.305
Okay.

21:19.340 --> 21:21.001
I'll be right back.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.855
So where did you go to school?

21:33.890 --> 21:36.518
Brown. You?

21:36.560 --> 21:38.721
Harvard. Siblings?

21:38.760 --> 21:40.625
Three brothers.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.548
Lawyers?

21:42.600 --> 21:45.398
No, the family was happy
to have just one lawyer.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.536
One's a painter, one's a writer,
one teaches at the Sorbonne.

21:48.570 --> 21:49.935
Really?

21:49.970 --> 21:51.403
That's in France, isn't it?

21:51.440 --> 21:53.328
Hmm.

22:02.480 --> 22:06.484
Okay, I talked to Peter,
and he has a counteroffer.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.351
DIANE:
Okay. What counteroffer?

22:08.390 --> 22:09.687
CARY:
Donny Pike.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.779
Senior acting member
of the Aryan Warlords.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.388
He's finishing up
a five year stretch

22:13.430 --> 22:14.556
at Pine Creek Penitentiary.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.124
ALICIA:
Oh, come on.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.720
The most dangerous man
in the Illinois system?

22:18.770 --> 22:20.635
CARY:
Yes, he is.

22:20.670 --> 22:21.898
And a confidante
of Colin Sweeney.

22:21.940 --> 22:25.762
Mr. Sweeney gives him stock tips
and Pike gives him protection.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.801
You want Sweeney
to testify against him?

22:27.840 --> 22:30.673
Yes. If_ he _wants a reduction
in his sentence.

22:30.710 --> 22:33.713
The last witness you tried to
turn against him was murdered.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.672
Yes. Well,

22:35.720 --> 22:37.881
we've learned from our mistakes.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.115
Here, you can keep this.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.128
GENEVA:
I was the ASA
who won that plea bargain

22:51.170 --> 22:52.899
and you're really considering
reversing it?

22:52.930 --> 22:54.830
Not reversing it.
He's served two years.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.394
For killing a woman.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.534
No, involuntary manslaughter,
with good behavior.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.674
GENEVA:
This is Colin Sweeney
we're talking about.

23:01.710 --> 23:02.836
The public knows his name.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.768
If we release him,
we'll be crucified.

23:04.810 --> 23:05.902
_Not if we're
usmg him to stop

23:05.950 --> 23:07.918
a neo-Nazi from committing
more murders from prison.

23:07.950 --> 23:10.111
What do you think, Imani?

23:11.620 --> 23:13.850
I think it's worth it

23:13.890 --> 23:15.915
if we can stop this
white supremacist.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.655
Yeah. If you stop him.

23:17.690 --> 23:19.885
But if Colin Sweeney
takes the stand,

23:19.930 --> 23:22.524
I don't know a jury in the
world who would trust him.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.822
Okay, we're going
to make the deal.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.758
GENEVA:
Peter, this is a mistake.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.768
You'll be the man
who released O.J.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.688
Would you make the deal
if it was just anybody?

23:29.740 --> 23:30.832
But it's not just anybody.

23:30.870 --> 23:33.065
I know, but if it were...

23:33.110 --> 23:34.839
would you make the deal?

23:34.880 --> 23:37.872
Two years left
on an involuntary manslaughter?

23:38.910 --> 23:40.548
There's your answer.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.810
But Geneva makes a good point
about the testimony.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.681
We're going to
make the deal,

23:44.720 --> 23:46.085
but he's got to give us more.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.451
CARY:
What more?

23:47.490 --> 23:49.481
A wire.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.058
Eli.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.557
What have you got?

23:56.600 --> 23:59.489
Keynote address at the
Democratic Convention.

23:59.530 --> 24:01.498
They were going
with Spellman,

24:01.540 --> 24:02.837
but he has an issue
opposmg gay marriage,

24:02.870 --> 24:05.134
so I got you the hearing
with Donna Brazile.

24:06.170 --> 24:07.876
I'm stunned.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.207
That's why you
hired me, Peter.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.902
To stun you.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.839
Look, you don't have to decide
about running for governor.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.519
Just take the meeting,
sweep her off her feet,

24:17.550 --> 24:18.949
keep hitting the
prison thing.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.082
That's your
selling point.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.884
Huh.
What?

24:22.920 --> 24:25.457
I may be in the news this week.

24:26.290 --> 24:29.054
Okay.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.592
A plea bargain that could gain
a lot of attention.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.530
Can you delay it?

24:34.570 --> 24:36.891
I could.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.999
But I won't.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.707
I would love to give
that keynote speech.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.514
Then don't get
in the news.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.916
And what does Kalinda Sharma
have against you?

24:52.650 --> 24:53.856
The investigator at
Lockhart/ Gardner,

24:53.890 --> 24:55.016
she won't do any
work for you.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.186
What's that about?

24:58.190 --> 25:00.181
I don't know.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.564
Really? I didn't know that.
Is she good?

25:04.600 --> 25:05.897
Caitlin?

25:05.930 --> 25:08.637
Yes. It's just...

25:08.670 --> 25:10.809
she's David Lee's niece, and
I'm feeling a little pressure.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.909
Who's the better lavwer?

25:11.940 --> 25:12.907
Well, they're both good.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.703
It's just...

25:14.740 --> 25:16.037
I don't know,
there's something about Martha.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.672
I like her.

25:17.710 --> 25:20.201
And Caitlin
is a classic "C" student.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.569
Well, you know what they say:

25:21.620 --> 25:22.871
"A" students make great
professors,

25:22.920 --> 25:24.581
"B" students make great judges,

25:24.620 --> 25:25.939
and "C" students make partner.

25:25.990 --> 25:26.911
GRACE (over phone):
Mom!

25:26.950 --> 25:28.884
Okay, I got to go.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.955
Thanks, Will.

25:29.990 --> 25:32.720
Did you tell Jennifer
not to be friends with me?

25:32.760 --> 25:33.954
Did I...?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.228
Did you tell her
not to be my friend?

25:35.260 --> 25:37.967
No, I told her that I wanted her

25:38.000 --> 25:39.126
to concentrate _more
on your studies.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.637
Why, what did she say?

25:40.670 --> 25:41.967
Nothing.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.935
She left after we studied.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.835
Why would you tell her that?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.802
Because, Grace...

25:49.840 --> 25:52.308
she's 22, and you're 14.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.818
So?
So...

25:54.850 --> 25:57.045
why isn't she with friends
her own age?

25:57.080 --> 25:59.139
Because she's my friend.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.782
No, she's you're tutor.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.048
I'm paying her.

26:02.090 --> 26:04.729
Why can't she be both?

26:06.760 --> 26:09.354
Because it's unprofessional.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.197
It's...

26:11.230 --> 26:12.993
I don't have friends, Mom.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.066
Don't you know that?

26:15.100 --> 26:17.295
She's my only real friend.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.331
She's my friend.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.770
And with you at work
all the time...

26:21.810 --> 26:22.936
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.299
You do not get to play
that card.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.379
Look, maybe I overreacted.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.980
I just don't want you
doing these videos.

26:33.020 --> 26:36.217
I just think it's dangerous
to do them in the street.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.921
It's not.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.053
Grace, would you please
just let me be the parent

26:40.090 --> 26:41.751
for a minute here.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.199
If you want to take dance...

26:43.230 --> 26:44.868
I don't want to take dance.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.128
I just want to do this.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.990
Why?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.189
Because it's cool.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.593
Because nobody else is doing it.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.635
(phone ringing)

26:57.180 --> 26:59.705
Okay, let me think on it.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.809
(phone continues ringing)

27:02.850 --> 27:05.944
Alicia Florrick.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.304
Ah, my goodness.

27:27.340 --> 27:30.036
The quality of convicts
has really gone downhill.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.071
CARY:
We have a deal
for you, Mr. Sweeney.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.941
That's why
we're meeting you here.

27:33.980 --> 27:35.811
They will give you
your freedom

27:35.850 --> 27:38.148
in exchange for evidence
against Donny Pike.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.885
Donald?

27:39.920 --> 27:41.057
CARY:
Yes, he's ordered
the deaths

27:41.090 --> 27:42.819
of four witnesses
from prison.

27:42.860 --> 27:45.124
You want me to testify
against him?

27:45.160 --> 27:46.081
No. The deal's not
for what you know.

27:46.130 --> 27:47.791
It's for what
you'll find out.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.718
CARY:
We don't think you're
the most trustworthy witness.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.194
That's why we'll need you
to wear a wire.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.369
CELESTE:
That wasn't the deal.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.958
Well, that's the new deal.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.128
We're arranging to have Pike
transferred to another prison,

27:59.170 --> 28:00.774
they'll route him
through County.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.209
Mr. Sweeney and Pike

28:02.240 --> 28:04.800
will have three hours
together in the yard.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.045
Get him to admit to his newest
murder, and you're free.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.377
No. It's too dangerous.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.719
CARY:
Is it, Mr. Sweeney?

28:11.750 --> 28:12.887
Is it too dangerous?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.909
You don't want to do this.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.985
Alicia, it's his decision.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.421
You're gonna have
to supervise the wire.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.997
He thinks you care about him.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.907
What's even weirde_r--
you do care about him.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.874
No. I don't want him
getting killed.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.434
That's a pretty low bar
for caring.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.971
It's a pretty high bar
for a wife-killer.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.070
You're very
interesting, Alicia.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.769
How did you end up with Will?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.742
What makes you think
we ended up together?

28:46.790 --> 28:48.212
Will's attitude.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.409
He's smitten.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.382
Really? Smitten.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.250
Feels like the right word.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.258
It's sweet

28:55.300 --> 28:58.827
and high school, and

28:58.870 --> 28:59.996
very vanilla.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.167
That's no slam on you.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.758
(laughing)

29:02.800 --> 29:04.358
No, of course not.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.866
But what about you?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.263
You broke up with Will

29:07.310 --> 29:08.538
nine years ago?

29:08.580 --> 29:11.174
And yet, here you are,
trying to hurt him.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.199
Talk about high school.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.399
(laughs)

29:13.450 --> 29:15.008
(door opens)

29:15.050 --> 29:17.348
What do you think
you're doing?!
David.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.314
She's my niece.
I told you she's my niece.

29:19.350 --> 29:22.217
Oh, wait a minute. You-You
told me to hire who I wanted.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.228
Yes, and I told you
she was my niece.

29:24.260 --> 29:25.784
What else do you need to know?

29:25.830 --> 29:27.229
Look, David, Caitlin's good.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.524
She's very good,
and she'll find another job.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.891
This isn't about another.

29:30.930 --> 29:33.262
Don't you dare cross me again.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.164
You said
you didn't want nepotism.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.565
quwm

29:35.600 --> 29:37.261
there was no nepotism.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.530
You are a third-year associate.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.276
You were given this task

29:41.310 --> 29:43.870
because you are unimportant,
and you can take a hint.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.798
So take the hint,

29:45.850 --> 29:48.819
or we'll take it out
of your hands.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.241
(door closes)

29:57.190 --> 29:59.420
Let's get a drink.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.155
Mmm.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.498
You know the
best revenge?

30:03.530 --> 30:05.066
Hide his Bluetooth.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.192
No. Hire his niece,

30:06.230 --> 30:08.130
and then make her life hell.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.161
Oh, my God, you are so right.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.168
You'll never do it.
No, I will do it.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.939
I'm not a good person.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.277
Yes, you are.

30:15.310 --> 30:17.335
Shut up.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.472
I just don't like women.

30:18.510 --> 30:20.171
I find them uninteresting.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.218
Excuse me?

30:24.250 --> 30:25.842
I don't like women.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.243
They're all competing with me.

30:27.290 --> 30:28.359
Don't men compete with you?

30:28.390 --> 30:30.255
No, they don't.

30:30.290 --> 30:32.053
You have
female friends?

30:32.090 --> 30:33.557
No,

30:33.590 --> 30:35.899
but I don't have
any male friends, either.

30:35.930 --> 30:37.557
(laughs)

30:37.600 --> 30:39.898
That's so sad.

30:39.930 --> 30:42.034
I'd be your friend,
but I can't.

30:42.070 --> 30:43.037
Why not?

30:43.070 --> 30:44.332
Because. Will.

30:44.370 --> 30:46.235
Ah, that's right.

30:46.270 --> 30:48.204
Yeah.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.037
I don't like you
being with him.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.048
I'm gonna break you two up.

30:53.550 --> 30:55.518
Okay. How?

30:55.550 --> 30:57.848
How will I do it?

30:59.020 --> 31:02.012
I will... tell you about him.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.028
Well, go ahead.

31:04.060 --> 31:06.085
Give me your worst.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.258
No. I like you.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.528
See, that's your problem.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.221
You built it up too much,

31:12.270 --> 31:15.262
so if he hasn't buried
a hobo in the desert,

31:15.300 --> 31:17.291
I will be unimpressed.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.160
Oh, that's ancient history
anyway.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.235
And it was only $45,000.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.429
That's all?

31:22.480 --> 31:24.175
Yup, and he put it back.

31:24.210 --> 31:25.677
(laughs)

31:25.710 --> 31:27.917
You're so bad at this.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.679
(laughs)

31:29.720 --> 31:32.086
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.157
I'm transparent as cellophane.

31:39.390 --> 31:41.358
I got to go.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.389
You're kidding.
Nope.

31:42.430 --> 31:47.367
Just remember, Will is like me.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.436
He'll always disappoint you.

31:49.470 --> 31:52.462

32:03.550 --> 32:05.347
(buzzing, indistinct chatter)

32:05.390 --> 32:07.381
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, attention...

32:07.420 --> 32:11.220
(announcement continues
indistinctly)

32:11.260 --> 32:13.581
TECH:
The microphone is sewn
into your collar, Mr. Sweeney.

32:13.630 --> 32:14.699
Just keep your hands
away from it.

32:14.730 --> 32:16.721
Mm-hmm, very clever.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.421
Testing, testing!

32:18.470 --> 32:20.688
Just a normal voice,
Mr. Sweeney.

32:22.270 --> 32:25.239
Okay, so just
to remind you,

32:25.270 --> 32:28.000
Pike you know,

32:28.040 --> 32:30.235
but this fine citizen here
is Darryl Boyd,

32:30.280 --> 32:32.043
Pike's lieutenant
on the outside.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.674
Pike orders a hit in here, Boyd
carries it out on the street.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.712
This is Garfield Park
just last week.

32:37.750 --> 32:42.050
CARY:
You get Pike to admit he
ordered the Garfield Park hit,

32:42.090 --> 32:43.489
and I sign your
release authorization.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.488
Simple as that, huh?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.589
I'll be right here,
Mr. Sweeney, watching.

32:47.630 --> 32:49.450
Anything goes wrong,

32:49.500 --> 32:50.296
just walk away.

32:50.330 --> 32:52.389
They have security guards
standing by.

32:52.430 --> 32:55.137
They won't get there in time.

32:55.170 --> 32:59.266
When things happen, Mrs.
Florrick, they happen fast.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.336
Well, don't get
yourself killed, okay?

33:02.380 --> 33:05.474
Words to live by.

33:05.510 --> 33:07.307
CARY:
Okay,

33:07.350 --> 33:09.079
here we go.
Break a leg.

33:19.690 --> 33:22.124
(indistinct chatter)

33:22.160 --> 33:23.127
Hey, it's Sweeney.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.161
What's up, paperboy?

33:25.130 --> 33:27.223
It's all right, he's cool.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.635
Donald, hey.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.638
PIKE: _
What are you domg here?

33:30.670 --> 33:31.637
SWEENEY:
Testifying.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.399
Some civil case.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.170
Just an excuse
for a vacation, actually.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.098
I talked it up
so they'd go for it.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.708
PIKE:
So what's going on
with the market?

33:39.750 --> 33:41.513
Did you see HP?

33:41.550 --> 33:43.541
SWEENEY:
Yeah, don't worry.

33:43.580 --> 33:47.516
Sell at 20
and you'll be fine.

33:47.550 --> 33:51.088
Listen, Donald, I wanted
to ask you about something.

33:51.130 --> 33:55.499
Um, I read about Garfield Park
in the paper.

33:55.530 --> 33:58.419
Was that you?

33:58.470 --> 33:59.823
What is he doing?

33:59.870 --> 34:01.269
PIKE:
Why you talking about stuff

34:01.300 --> 34:03.131
that don't concern you, Sweeney?

34:03.170 --> 34:04.467
No, no, no,
I was just wondering.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.465
Well, don't.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.603
You know, you're funny.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.098
Like a pet.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.277
Don't make me
put you down.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.586
I like him.

34:21.620 --> 34:22.712
ELI:
I like him, too.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.556
He has a good story.

34:23.590 --> 34:26.286
He does-- prison,
wrongful conviction,

34:26.330 --> 34:28.389
back from the dead.

34:28.430 --> 34:29.419
He'd make a good keynote.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.427
He speaks well.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.791
He does.

34:31.830 --> 34:34.298
So?

34:34.340 --> 34:37.798
I just don't want him
to blow up in our face.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.468
How would he blow up
in your face?

34:40.510 --> 34:42.068
His marriage.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.508
Are you hearing
something?

34:45.550 --> 34:46.505
Of course I am.

34:46.550 --> 34:48.313
I'm hearing
they live apart,

34:48.350 --> 34:50.545
and if I'm
hearing it,

34:50.580 --> 34:52.582
the Republicans are
hearing it, too.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.258
If they were hearing it,
they'd use it.

34:54.290 --> 34:56.155
No, they would do
what we would do--

34:56.190 --> 34:58.488
release it the day
before he speaks.

35:00.690 --> 35:03.488
Of course you don't have
an issue with it, Eli.

35:03.530 --> 35:05.259
Peter Flo_rrick
is in office.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.518
When he runs for governor,
they will use it.

35:07.570 --> 35:11.336
They will use all of it, not
just on him but his wife, too.

35:14.510 --> 35:17.434
What if I promised
they'd be together?

35:18.780 --> 35:20.748
Is that a promise you can keep?

35:20.780 --> 35:22.247
Yes, it is.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.613
Then we'll consider
him for keynote.

35:25.650 --> 35:28.153
Again, Eli,
I like him.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.488
He's a thoroughbred,

35:30.520 --> 35:34.729
but I just can't
risk... risk.

35:41.970 --> 35:44.359
Okay, here he goes.
IMANI:
We've got about ten
minutes before they return

35:44.410 --> 35:45.160
to their cells.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.837
I thought we were
done talking.

35:46.870 --> 35:49.600
I-I-I want to know
about Garfield Park.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.471
Is he out of his mind?

35:51.510 --> 35:52.499
MAN:
Look at this guy.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.505
What are you, stupid?

35:53.550 --> 35:54.414
What, are you
smoking crack

35:54.450 --> 35:56.645
with the brothers?
Get the guard ready.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.942
I think he looks like a snitch.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.789
Think he looks like a snitch?
Go now, Cary.

35:59.820 --> 36:02.653
He's a snitch.

36:02.690 --> 36:03.679
You got to pull him out now.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.449
We pull him out now, no deal.

36:05.490 --> 36:06.525
Wait, listen.

36:06.560 --> 36:10.189
Hey, hey, Donald,
H didn't mean anything by it.

36:10.230 --> 36:11.697
Why the hell do
you keep asking?

36:11.730 --> 36:13.368
'Cause I-I need
your help.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.765
You know what they did.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.688
They took my company from me.

36:16.740 --> 36:19.265
PIKE:
Everybody here's got
a story, paperboy.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.732
What makes you so special?

36:20.770 --> 36:22.533
SWEENEY:
I have money...

36:22.580 --> 36:25.674
and I want the man
who did this dead.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.769
Gerald Drescher.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.414
He used to be my vice president

36:29.450 --> 36:33.409
until he stabbed me
in the back.

36:33.450 --> 36:34.883
You're serious?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.252
How much
would it cost?

36:37.290 --> 36:39.554
PIKE:
A guy like that has security.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.265
Uh,

36:45.300 --> 36:48.565
job like that--
it'll cost a lot of money.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.865
That's why I got to know
what I'm getting.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.730
Okay, here he goes, nice move.

36:53.770 --> 36:54.771
You're pushing
it, Sweeney.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.677
You're in prison.

36:57.710 --> 37:00.270
I'm asking,
how can you get it done?

37:08.720 --> 37:10.756
All right, sure.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.657
Garfield Park--
yeah, that was me.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.989
My boy on the outside--
I get word to through my sister.

37:21.030 --> 37:25.000
I give the green light,
he does the hit.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.406
(sighs)

37:27.440 --> 37:29.533
A hit on his vice president,
huh?

37:29.580 --> 37:32.003
Oh, come on,
he had to say something.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.574
You have _ _
the release authorization?

37:33.610 --> 37:36.773
Already blessed by Judge Romano.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.919
(chuckles)

37:39.950 --> 37:41.918
Pleasure doing
business with you.

37:50.860 --> 37:52.896
DIANE:
Is your health issue from the
other day better, Mr. Sweeney?

37:52.930 --> 37:55.034
Much better, thank you.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.698
My goodness, I must
have made a fuss here.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.628
Food poisoning.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.638
Uh, now, Mr. Sweeney,
you testified

38:01.680 --> 38:04.672
that you were present
at the IPO meeting?

38:04.710 --> 38:06.507
That's right.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.370
DIANE:
And did you hear
any discussion

38:08.420 --> 38:09.910
about the deicing in the wings?

38:09.950 --> 38:11.645
SWEENEY:
Oh, yes,

38:11.690 --> 38:16.855
I heard everything,
and it's not good.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.821
Good job, I, I hear you saved
some kind of case today.

38:26.870 --> 38:29.395
Oh, I just-- we
got a settlement.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.738
Great, great.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.032
We should talk sometime.

38:33.070 --> 38:34.537
About?

38:34.580 --> 38:35.774
The future.
(chuckles)

38:35.810 --> 38:37.004
What else?

38:42.450 --> 38:44.418
I'm so sorry I'm late.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.589
Thank you for coming
back in, Martha.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.817
I just had a few more
questions before we decide.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.589
Before you...?

38:51.630 --> 38:52.722
What are you talking about?

38:52.760 --> 38:53.852
They already decided.

38:53.890 --> 38:55.755
I-I'm sorry, what?

38:55.800 --> 38:57.552
I didn't get
the job here.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.488
I turned down my other job

38:59.530 --> 39:01.498
because I thought I had
this, and now...

39:01.540 --> 39:03.735
I can't believe this.

39:03.770 --> 39:05.863
Well, who told you
you didn't get this?
The hiring committee.

39:05.910 --> 39:06.763
They called.

39:06.810 --> 39:08.937
Well, there must be
some sort of mistake,

39:08.980 --> 39:10.777
because I haven't decided yet.

39:10.810 --> 39:12.402
No, they did.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.078
He said I was close,
but they had a vote.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.940
So what happened?

39:18.490 --> 39:20.048
(elevator bell dings)

39:20.090 --> 39:22.058
Now, your office is
on the 27th floor,

39:22.090 --> 39:24.684
but I want to show you
around here first.

39:24.730 --> 39:25.719
Now, this...
Alicia!

39:25.760 --> 39:27.819
Thank you so much.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.589
I am just so thrilled.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.052
David said it was all you.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.762
You picked me,
and you're gonna
be my mentor.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.995
Yes, Alicia, thank you.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.961
You're welcome.
Anyway, I
am really

39:40.010 --> 39:41.898
looking forward to
working with you.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.931
Thank you again.

39:53.790 --> 39:56.953
I don't get it. Why put me
through the charade...

39:56.990 --> 39:59.424
Alicia..
No. I want to know.

39:59.460 --> 40:00.927
I never had any power, did I?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.120
It was all rigged.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.566
David Lee appealed
to the hiring committee,

40:05.600 --> 40:07.568
and the hiring committee
voted to go another way.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.965
That's all.
It happens.

40:15.710 --> 40:17.678
Which way did you vote?

40:17.710 --> 40:19.007
On what?

40:19.050 --> 40:20.938
The committee voted for Caitlin
and against Martha.

40:20.980 --> 40:22.470
Which way did you vote?

40:24.820 --> 40:27.118
I voted with David Lee.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.815
Why?

40:32.760 --> 40:34.648
Because I owed him.

40:34.700 --> 40:35.792
For what?

40:35.830 --> 40:37.798
You don't want to know.
I do want to know.

40:37.830 --> 40:39.058
I feel used, Will.

40:39.100 --> 40:43.662
I feel like I was given a job
and it was taken away from me.

40:49.210 --> 40:51.701
(clicks pen closed)

40:51.750 --> 40:54.844
There was a Martha
when we hired you, Alicia.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.040
On paper,

40:57.080 --> 41:01.016
she was the better candidate
and you were the... Caitlin.

41:06.090 --> 41:08.752
You were gonna lose in a vote.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.224
I asked David Lee
to vote with me.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.134
So I owed him.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.678
You okay?

41:30.080 --> 41:32.878
Thank you.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.979
Caitlins often surprise you.
