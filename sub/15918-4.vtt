WEBVTT

00:01.984 --> 00:03.668
It is really hard to tap dance

00:03.751 --> 00:06.419
for people when you're
talking about Syria.

00:06.454 --> 00:09.256
They may be shallow,
but we need them.

00:09.351 --> 00:12.920
How do we make
invading Mali sexy?

00:12.950 --> 00:13.950
I'm coming out.

00:13.984 --> 00:15.284
Baby, gay is the new black.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.186
It's old news and no one cares.

00:17.221 --> 00:18.321
Nobody cares about what?

00:18.355 --> 00:19.515
Our standard prayer has been,

00:19.523 --> 00:21.924
"God, save our son
from this demon."

00:23.694 --> 00:25.261
Ahh!

00:27.364 --> 00:29.165
How do you forget about a wife?

00:29.199 --> 00:31.934
Did you know that me and your husband
have been sleeping together?

00:32.826 --> 00:34.546
They say I'm the one with a problem.
Yo, yo!

00:34.571 --> 00:36.005
Oh my God, oh my God!

00:36.039 --> 00:37.506
You're an addict, Mary Jane.
What?

00:37.541 --> 00:39.742
You exhibit the classic
traits of addiction.

00:39.776 --> 00:41.344
The secrets, the lies,

00:41.378 --> 00:42.845
the perpetual attempts to quit.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.290
There's a void he's filling in
your life and you're hooked.

01:38.468 --> 01:39.902
Do you have to go?

01:39.937 --> 01:41.704
No.

01:46.543 --> 01:50.746
I say next time,
we pick the movie.

01:50.781 --> 01:53.916
This one's not even halfway through
and they're both out like a light.

01:53.951 --> 01:55.785
They've already
seen it three times.

01:58.488 --> 02:00.370
I think they just wanted
to watch it with you.

02:30.994 --> 02:36.994

02:45.869 --> 02:47.303
What are you doing now?

02:48.772 --> 02:51.540
Checking my other
online dating service.

02:52.709 --> 02:55.478
And why aren't you
doing that at your house?

02:55.512 --> 02:58.147
'Cause nobody's home.

02:58.181 --> 03:00.549
Even the dog
wanted to go with John.

03:00.584 --> 03:03.486
Okay, well, either you're
spending the night

03:03.520 --> 03:06.188
or I'm kicking you
out in 30 minutes.

03:06.223 --> 03:07.990
What do you think of him?

03:09.659 --> 03:11.227
He's cute.

03:11.261 --> 03:12.661
He may be good for you.

03:12.696 --> 03:14.630
He's...

03:14.664 --> 03:17.299
49, he's athletic.

03:17.334 --> 03:18.401
And white.

03:18.435 --> 03:19.702
Oh, shut up.

03:20.937 --> 03:21.937
I don't know.

03:21.972 --> 03:23.906
He's got like four kids, though.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.475
If that's the case, how am
I gonna come first?

03:26.510 --> 03:27.676
You know?

03:27.711 --> 03:29.278
Then stick with
Carlos the intern.

03:29.312 --> 03:30.713
He's illegal.

03:30.747 --> 03:31.714
I'm sorry.

03:31.748 --> 03:34.683
Undocumented.

03:34.718 --> 03:36.318
Hope he ain't trying to
hook up with me

03:36.353 --> 03:38.154
to get a damn green card.

03:38.188 --> 03:40.790
What?

03:40.824 --> 03:41.524
Nothing.

03:41.558 --> 03:44.193
We're all paranoid
about something.

03:44.227 --> 03:46.262
Aren't you on here, too?

03:46.296 --> 03:48.931
Yeah, but I only
signed up for research.

03:48.965 --> 03:50.132
Why don't you just admit

03:50.167 --> 03:53.035
that you're like the millions of
us trying to find love online?

03:53.070 --> 03:55.171
I'm not looking for
anybody right now.

03:55.205 --> 03:56.372
Yeah.

03:56.406 --> 03:59.708
Still stuck on David?

03:59.743 --> 04:01.410
Hmm.

04:04.347 --> 04:05.648
Oh.

04:05.682 --> 04:07.349
I found you.

04:07.384 --> 04:09.185
What's your pass code?

04:09.219 --> 04:10.820
Mmm...

04:14.191 --> 04:15.357
I think that's it.

04:15.392 --> 04:17.760
I haven't been on
in like four months.

04:17.793 --> 04:19.361
Let's see.

04:21.798 --> 04:24.900
You have 12 new messages.

04:24.935 --> 04:26.702
Look at you.

04:26.736 --> 04:28.270
You hooked a professor.

04:28.305 --> 04:32.541
We have to find out if he's
at an accredited university.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.357
Look how cute.
Eh.

04:34.358 --> 04:37.213
What? You don't like him because
he's chocolate and beardless?

04:37.247 --> 04:39.348
Shut up.
That's your type.

04:39.382 --> 04:41.283
You like 'em bright
and I like 'em white.

04:41.318 --> 04:43.052
I'm not interested
because there's probably

04:43.086 --> 04:44.787
something wrong with him.

04:44.821 --> 04:47.456
He's married
or has a secret family.

04:49.392 --> 04:52.294
Like you said, we're all
paranoid about something.

04:52.329 --> 04:55.164
You can delete him.

04:55.198 --> 04:56.298
All right.

04:56.333 --> 04:57.433
Last call.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.301
You want anything?
Water, please.

05:06.176 --> 05:10.312
"I look better in person."

05:33.970 --> 05:35.404
"Hi, Mary Jane.

05:35.438 --> 05:39.742
"Like the pic mystery and trust
you look better in person.

05:39.776 --> 05:40.876
Let's chat."

07:11.334 --> 07:12.901
What are you doing?

07:16.306 --> 07:17.706
Oh no.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.575
You're gonna pull it
out of the socket.

07:26.483 --> 07:29.151
Isn't this what you say...

07:29.185 --> 07:31.654
what you always say you want?

07:31.688 --> 07:33.122
To wake up to me
going down on you?

07:33.156 --> 07:36.325
No, but you're using a pillow.

07:36.359 --> 07:36.925
My neck hurts.

07:42.198 --> 07:43.999
At least I'm trying.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.301
What are you doing?

07:50.974 --> 07:53.709
Poverty in America continues to
be a controversial discourse

07:53.743 --> 07:56.612
as the American dream
becomes more and more elusive.

07:56.646 --> 07:58.281
George Carlin once said,

07:58.342 --> 08:02.851
"It's called the American dream because
you have to be asleep to believe in it."

08:02.886 --> 08:03.919
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

08:03.953 --> 08:05.354
Thank you for listening.

08:07.590 --> 08:08.924
And we're out.

08:12.295 --> 08:14.830
Great interview.
Thanks.

08:14.864 --> 08:16.265
You're all smiley.

08:16.299 --> 08:19.635
We just finalized the new
format of The Bradley Hour.

08:19.669 --> 08:21.370
Nice, that was quick.
Mm-hmm.

08:21.404 --> 08:23.405
I can't wait to check it out.
Yeah.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.875
Oh, hey, if you're gonna
pretend to be me online,

08:26.910 --> 08:30.479
you should know
I don't use Internet slang.

08:30.513 --> 08:32.081
LOL!

08:32.115 --> 08:34.149
So are you going to
tell me what he said?

08:34.183 --> 08:37.019
Are you going for drinks
or dinner or what?

08:37.053 --> 08:38.620
Bye, Kara.
No.

08:38.655 --> 08:39.888
It's, "Thank you, Kara!"

08:39.923 --> 08:41.390
- Hey, Nichelle.
- Oh my God.

08:41.424 --> 08:42.991
I'm so glad you answered.

08:43.025 --> 08:46.128
Where are you, what are you doing?
Oh, jeez, okay, calm down, breathe.

08:46.162 --> 08:47.763
What happened?

08:47.797 --> 08:50.065
Okay, all right,
look, so here's my situation.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.700
Look, the mayor's chief of staff

08:51.701 --> 08:54.636
was supposed to be the keynote speaker
at my Girls Inc. luncheon tomorrow

08:54.671 --> 08:56.004
and she just canceled on me.

08:56.039 --> 08:58.806
And I know there's about a thousand
other people you can call.

08:58.807 --> 09:00.576
Yes, and you're
number one on that list.

09:00.610 --> 09:02.044
Mm-hmm.

09:02.078 --> 09:05.547
Look, I know it's
short notice, Mary Jane,

09:05.582 --> 09:07.883
but I'm expecting over
100 mentors and mentees

09:07.917 --> 09:09.051
tomorrow and I just...

09:09.085 --> 09:11.720
And I can't just slap
something together, Nichelle.

09:11.755 --> 09:13.188
You're a journalist.

09:13.223 --> 09:16.258
And I have a show to prepare for.
<i>What?</i>

09:16.292 --> 09:18.060
Look, I don't beg.

09:18.094 --> 09:20.229
Seven years of friendship
is all I'm saying.

09:23.099 --> 09:24.900
Is there a theme?
<i>Girl, I don't know.</i>

09:24.934 --> 09:26.568
The empowerment of solidarity.

09:26.603 --> 09:27.269
I'll find out.

09:30.073 --> 09:32.374
Kara.

09:33.743 --> 09:34.576
Yeah?
Close the door.

09:34.611 --> 09:35.844
Close the door.

09:40.350 --> 09:41.917
What?

09:41.951 --> 09:45.087
Are you still diddling
Carlos the intern?

09:45.121 --> 09:47.923
Yes.
Okay.

09:47.957 --> 09:50.659
Gotta say I'm a little torn.

09:50.693 --> 09:55.264
I can't tell if he's given
me Marc Anthony,

09:55.298 --> 09:56.598
you know, waif,

09:56.633 --> 09:58.467
but like a little dainty

09:58.501 --> 10:00.302
or just
flat-out Ricky Martin.

10:00.336 --> 10:01.703
You know?
Oh my God.

10:01.738 --> 10:05.841
I don't know if his merengue
is more like lemon meringue.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.743
Okay.
Yeah, look.

10:07.777 --> 10:11.447
If a fight breaks out,
you might have to jump in.

10:11.481 --> 10:12.948
Oh, come on, Mary Jane.

10:12.982 --> 10:14.283
Really?
I'm just saying.

10:14.317 --> 10:16.622
You might want to
have Mark check him out.

10:16.623 --> 10:19.662
He's checked out all of the guys
I've ever dated from David on down.

10:21.324 --> 10:24.126
Excuse me?

10:24.160 --> 10:27.262
I might want to have <i>Mark</i> check
him out? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.530
Kara.

10:28.565 --> 10:29.932
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.900
Yeah!
No, no, no, no...

10:31.935 --> 10:33.936
Oh, I knew it!
Kara, Kara, Kara, Kara.

10:33.970 --> 10:35.404
Shoot, this is so good!
Kara.

10:35.438 --> 10:36.371
This is so good!

10:36.406 --> 10:38.941
This explains everything.
This explains everything.

10:38.975 --> 10:40.909
You cannot say a word.
Oh, I can't believe it...

10:40.944 --> 10:42.511
Of course he's gay!
Please!

10:42.545 --> 10:44.480
I won't say anything.

10:44.514 --> 10:45.180
You're good.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.084
Oh... ah...

10:49.118 --> 10:51.053
Kara.

10:55.191 --> 10:56.725
Mmm.

11:02.007 --> 11:04.518
So all I need to do
is reset your message filter

11:04.519 --> 11:06.560
and that way, it'll
automatically filter out

11:06.561 --> 11:08.861
- all the winks that you don't want.
- Okay, good.

11:08.862 --> 11:10.463
Great, that's what I want to do.

11:10.497 --> 11:12.198
Okay.
Perfect.

11:15.169 --> 11:17.303
What's up with you and Dante?

11:17.337 --> 11:18.871
Nothing, we're fine.

11:23.010 --> 11:26.045
Mmm, I can feel you hating.

11:26.079 --> 11:29.148
But I'm not gonna say anything bad
about him if that's what you want.

11:29.183 --> 11:32.151
That's not what I want, Niecey.

11:32.186 --> 11:34.626
Is he still with the other baby mama?
We don't talk about her.

11:35.889 --> 11:37.123
Hey, Niecey.
What?

11:37.157 --> 11:38.624
Your girl called me again, okay?

11:38.659 --> 11:40.593
This needs to stop.

11:40.627 --> 11:42.295
Why are Niecey's
friends calling you?

11:42.329 --> 11:43.796
Relax your side eye, okay,

11:43.831 --> 11:46.399
because I only sell to folks
over 30, with careers.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.267
How does she even know about it?

11:48.302 --> 11:49.869
It's no big deal.

11:49.903 --> 11:52.905
And I know you are not selling
drugs out of this house.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.475
You know I'd never
do anything like that.

11:55.509 --> 11:56.909
Come on, you know me
better than that.

11:56.944 --> 11:59.579
I mean, well,
it does cure cancer.

11:59.613 --> 12:00.680
It does.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.350
Come on.

12:04.384 --> 12:05.952
Helen, what's wrong?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.119
What's wrong, Mom?

12:07.154 --> 12:10.022
My diamond bracelet's missing.

12:10.057 --> 12:11.591
Well, you just had it yesterday.

12:11.625 --> 12:12.825
Well, it's not here today

12:12.860 --> 12:14.627
and I want to
wear it to the gala.

12:14.661 --> 12:15.862
Mom, don't get upset.

12:15.896 --> 12:17.497
It'll turn up.

12:17.531 --> 12:19.611
Everybody just look around
the house for your mother.

12:28.308 --> 12:32.778
Statistics show that the poverty
rate for women was 16.2% in 2010

12:32.813 --> 12:35.715
and that there are over
16 million children

12:35.749 --> 12:37.917
living in poverty
in this country right now.

12:37.951 --> 12:39.585
<i>I know the statistics,</i>

12:39.620 --> 12:42.255
<i>but I still maintain that our</i>
<i>government shouldn't be some</i>

12:42.289 --> 12:43.356
<i>crutch to help these women</i>

12:43.390 --> 12:46.225
<i>hobble along</i>
<i>until times get better.</i>

12:46.260 --> 12:46.893
Hobble along?

12:46.927 --> 12:49.195
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:51.001 --> 12:52.298
I know you have an opinion.

12:52.332 --> 12:54.433
He has a point.

12:54.468 --> 12:55.801
When do government handouts end

12:55.836 --> 12:58.671
before individual
responsibility begins, huh?

12:58.705 --> 13:01.407
You can't hand people
a broken education system

13:01.441 --> 13:03.876
and then get mad when they
ask for a crutch later.

13:03.911 --> 13:05.044
Yeah, but come on, baby.

13:05.078 --> 13:06.679
I mean, people in the projects
laid up with more

13:06.713 --> 13:09.181
cable channels
than they do checking accounts

13:09.216 --> 13:11.083
or college degrees, come on.

13:11.118 --> 13:13.886
It is a ladder with
some rungs that are missing.

13:13.921 --> 13:16.122
Yeah, yeah, no, it's...
That is all I'm trying to say.

13:16.156 --> 13:19.859
No, what you're saying is you are
Mary Jane Paul, defender of the poor.

13:19.893 --> 13:21.961
Shut up!
â™ª Da-da-da-da â™ª

13:21.995 --> 13:22.895
Shut up!

13:22.930 --> 13:24.297
Shut up.

13:24.331 --> 13:25.998
But I like it.
Oh, you like it?

13:26.033 --> 13:26.933
Mm-hmm, that's what
I like about you.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.801
'Cause I was poor once.
Uh-huh.

13:31.104 --> 13:33.640
What?
What?!

13:33.660 --> 13:35.808
When you're on the show,
you have this habit of doing

13:35.842 --> 13:38.544
that thing with your eyebrow when
you're contemplating something.

13:38.579 --> 13:40.646
I call it
"the Mary Jane serious face."

13:42.849 --> 13:43.983
That's it.

13:44.017 --> 13:45.217
It's very intimidating.

13:47.054 --> 13:50.923
I do have an unconventional
journalistic technique.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.792
Is that what they call it?
Mm-hmm.

13:52.826 --> 13:55.261
But since you critiqued me...
Uh-huh?

13:55.295 --> 13:57.129
...you will not be
experiencing

13:57.164 --> 14:00.266
my techniques tonight, so...

14:00.300 --> 14:03.102
That's not cool.
No, no.

14:03.136 --> 14:06.305
But you will be
smothered by my pillow.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.440
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

14:08.775 --> 14:10.076
Jerk.

14:11.011 --> 14:12.578
What?

14:12.613 --> 14:13.879
What?
Never mind.

14:13.914 --> 14:15.081
No, come on.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.882
You can't be all
chuckle, chuckle

14:16.917 --> 14:18.384
and then like, "Oh no,
it's nothing."

14:18.418 --> 14:19.719
No, what?

14:19.753 --> 14:22.388
You can tell me anything.

14:22.422 --> 14:24.624
Um...

14:24.658 --> 14:26.959
Okay, well,
I was thinking about,

14:26.994 --> 14:30.463
uh, this funny thing Avery did
this morning with her pillow.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.567
Uh...

14:34.601 --> 14:35.868
See?

14:35.902 --> 14:37.403
I told you I shouldn't
have told you.

14:37.437 --> 14:41.741
You haven't said much, so...

14:41.775 --> 14:43.442
what did she do with the pillow?

14:46.747 --> 14:49.148
Let's change the subject.
No, let's not.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.716
Come on, turn the...
turn the TV...

14:50.751 --> 14:52.485
What did she do with the pillow?

14:55.455 --> 14:56.622
Okay.

14:56.657 --> 14:59.625
Well, I was, uh...

14:59.660 --> 15:03.062
I was sleeping
and she woke me up.

15:03.096 --> 15:07.466
She, uh, used her pillow
to prop her head up

15:07.501 --> 15:09.170
while she was
trying to give me head.

15:12.806 --> 15:14.974
Laziest head ever.

15:16.953 --> 15:18.754
I thought you were
sleeping in the guest room.

15:18.779 --> 15:20.746
I am in the guest room.

15:20.781 --> 15:23.249
I mean, it's complicated...
No, that's not complicated.

15:23.283 --> 15:26.419
Either you are sleeping in
the bed with her

15:26.453 --> 15:27.820
or you're not.
What do you want me to say, huh?

15:27.854 --> 15:29.155
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.190
You could say
something crazy like,

15:31.224 --> 15:33.826
"I'm not sleeping with
the both of you."

15:33.860 --> 15:36.028
This is what...

15:36.063 --> 15:37.663
You just said, "Say anything.

15:37.698 --> 15:38.898
You can say anything."

15:38.932 --> 15:40.633
This is the stuff...
no, seriously.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.967
Now, this confuses me.

15:42.002 --> 15:44.470
You tell a man to
say anything and he...

15:44.504 --> 15:47.373
and then I open up about
lazy head.

15:47.407 --> 15:49.041
This is so confusing.

15:49.076 --> 15:50.409
You just said,
"Say anything."

15:50.444 --> 15:51.677
So I said it.
No, no, no, no, no.

15:51.712 --> 15:52.812
Great try.

15:52.846 --> 15:54.046
That was a solid effort.

15:54.081 --> 15:55.448
Did the switcheroo.

15:55.482 --> 15:57.349
Didn't take, but solid.

15:57.384 --> 15:58.751
But you know what?

15:58.785 --> 16:02.988
Um, since we can, you know,
tell each other anything,

16:03.023 --> 16:06.092
you should know, um, I'm dating.

16:08.729 --> 16:10.096
No you're not.

16:11.565 --> 16:13.165
We can tell each other anything!

16:14.334 --> 16:16.202
And I'm not lazy.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.104
I give it my all.

16:40.193 --> 16:41.694
But why would she think that?

16:41.728 --> 16:42.995
She's upset, you know.

16:43.029 --> 16:44.530
I wouldn't steal her bracelet.

16:44.564 --> 16:45.965
Did you tell her?
Yeah.

16:45.999 --> 16:47.279
Just let me handle it,
all right?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.368
But why aren't you up there
handling it right now?

16:49.402 --> 16:50.836
Because now is not a good time.

16:52.405 --> 16:54.540
Tracy, you should leave now.

16:54.574 --> 16:56.342
Don't pay her no mind.

16:56.376 --> 16:58.544
I am done.
Tracy.

16:59.546 --> 17:01.480
I was dealing with it,
Mary Jane... damn.

17:01.515 --> 17:04.550
- And I'm doing what Mom
asked me to do. - You couldn't just
tell Ma to come talk to me.

17:04.554 --> 17:06.417
No, you gotta run over here
and try to be up in everything.

17:06.453 --> 17:07.386
You already know how Mom
feels about Tracy

17:07.420 --> 17:08.753
being over here all the time.
Tracy's family.

17:08.789 --> 17:11.357
She's D'Asia's mother.
Except this isn't your house, Patrick.

17:11.391 --> 17:12.590
I'm living here, ain't I?

17:12.626 --> 17:14.960
And how many bills do you pay?

17:18.031 --> 17:20.766
Mrs. Patterson,
I know you don't like me,

17:20.800 --> 17:23.335
but I do care about you.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.271
I would never steal
anything from you

17:25.305 --> 17:26.505
or anyone else for that matter.

17:26.540 --> 17:27.839
I'm not a thief.

17:27.874 --> 17:30.910
Tracy, let me just
stop you right there.

17:30.944 --> 17:34.547
Now, I've tried to be
civil with you

17:34.581 --> 17:36.115
for D'Asia's sake,

17:36.149 --> 17:38.484
but you just can't take a hint.

17:39.820 --> 17:43.088
I don't feel comfortable
with you in my house. Why not?

17:43.123 --> 17:45.457
I'm not going to
argue with you anymore.

17:45.492 --> 17:48.260
I believe you took my bracelet

17:48.295 --> 17:51.297
and, given your
past drug addiction...

17:51.331 --> 17:53.365
Me and Patrick
got the same past.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.301
Oh, you think he stole it?

17:55.335 --> 17:56.669
No, that's not what I'm saying.

17:56.703 --> 17:59.371
But why are you accusing me?

17:59.406 --> 18:02.541
Because Patrick is my son.

18:02.576 --> 18:04.176
And I don't believe he did it.

18:17.190 --> 18:19.625
Come on, D'Asia.

18:19.659 --> 18:21.160
So that's it?

18:21.194 --> 18:22.761
You're just gonna walk out?

18:22.796 --> 18:24.396
Don't touch me.

18:26.499 --> 18:28.667
Hey, give Daddy...

18:28.702 --> 18:30.369
See you.
See you later.

18:34.256 --> 18:35.617
You don't wanna stand,
that's fine.

18:35.642 --> 18:38.010
We'll have you sit behind
the desk for the whole show

18:38.044 --> 18:40.012
as long as you take
your jacket off,

18:40.046 --> 18:42.548
you know, roll up your sleeves a little...
Kara, I already told you,
I'm not taking my jacket off

18:42.582 --> 18:44.650
so find something else to tweak.

18:44.684 --> 18:46.218
Great, great.

18:46.253 --> 18:48.187
Then we're walking, all right?

18:48.221 --> 18:49.822
Your monitors are over there.

18:49.856 --> 18:51.690
You're gonna be walking,
so show me the walk.

18:51.725 --> 18:52.825
Okay, all right.

18:52.859 --> 18:54.827
Um...
All right.

18:54.861 --> 18:56.962
So we got news, news, news.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.063
Well, not like that.

18:58.098 --> 19:01.133
That's gay... lant.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.602
What? What did you say?
I said "gaylant."

19:03.637 --> 19:07.573
I mean, um, you know, gallant.

19:07.607 --> 19:09.174
You know what, let's just
take a break.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.443
Let's, um...

19:11.478 --> 19:12.511
I'm gonna go pee, yeah.

19:12.545 --> 19:14.113
That might be best.

19:14.147 --> 19:15.381
Right.

19:19.690 --> 19:20.756
Thank you.

19:33.208 --> 19:33.974
Sean?

19:35.292 --> 19:37.226
Mary Jane.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.294
Mary Jane Paul.

19:40.363 --> 19:42.231
Are you nervous?

19:42.265 --> 19:44.666
A little.

19:44.701 --> 19:46.835
Of course you didn't
post a picture

19:46.869 --> 19:49.404
because you're
a local celebrity.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.406
Just local?

19:51.441 --> 19:52.507
Who said local?

19:52.542 --> 19:54.409
I said national.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.044
I can live with that.
Yes.

19:56.079 --> 19:57.512
Please.

19:58.548 --> 20:01.016
So how long have you
been at Oglethorpe?

20:01.050 --> 20:03.418
Oh, probably about 10 years.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.320
Mmm.

20:05.355 --> 20:06.922
Wow, you must love teaching.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.023
I'm very lucky.

20:08.057 --> 20:10.459
And my students are patient.

20:10.493 --> 20:13.195
Well, I never had a professor
like you in college.

20:13.229 --> 20:14.930
I bet all the girls
have crushes on you.

20:16.866 --> 20:19.434
Microbiology professor?

20:19.469 --> 20:20.302
No.

20:20.336 --> 20:22.537
I'm not cool enough
for most of them.

20:22.572 --> 20:23.405
What about you?

20:23.439 --> 20:25.807
How long have you been at SNC?

20:25.842 --> 20:27.809
Just a couple years.

20:27.844 --> 20:30.379
So you said someone in your
family was in journalism.

20:30.413 --> 20:32.781
Mmm, my mother.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.416
She, uh...

20:34.450 --> 20:36.418
Sorry.

20:37.553 --> 20:38.654
Sorry, it's my niece.

20:38.688 --> 20:40.122
Keep talking.

20:40.156 --> 20:44.159
Okay, uh, back in the day,
my mom worked at WCIV.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.094
She, uh...
Teenagers.

20:48.097 --> 20:49.865
Sorry.
It's all right.

20:54.203 --> 20:55.270
You okay?
Yeah.

20:55.305 --> 20:56.872
Everything's okay.

20:56.906 --> 20:58.473
Keep talking.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.941
Well, back in the day,

20:59.976 --> 21:02.244
my mom did some work at WCIV.

21:02.278 --> 21:05.447
It's a local station in Charleston.
Uh-huh.

21:05.481 --> 21:06.748
No... yeah.

21:06.783 --> 21:08.350
Your brother.
Mother.

21:08.384 --> 21:09.318
Right, right.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.753
In Charleston.

21:11.788 --> 21:13.255
Sorry.

21:17.627 --> 21:20.329
Sorry, work drama.
Duty calls.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.596
I'm sorry, Sean.

21:21.631 --> 21:23.765
I am shutting off my phone.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.833
Not another text.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.002
Keep going, I'm listening.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.072
Yeah, uh, yeah,
everything's fine.

21:30.106 --> 21:31.540
Um, go on.

21:31.574 --> 21:32.974
Um, no, I'm listening.

21:33.009 --> 21:34.609
Uh...
It's okay.

21:34.644 --> 21:37.045
Look, you've got
a lot on your plate.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.714
My buddy owns the place.

21:38.748 --> 21:40.615
Dinner's on me.
No.

21:40.650 --> 21:41.616
You just stay here.

21:41.651 --> 21:42.918
Use this as your office.

21:42.952 --> 21:45.654
Take care of the work drama,
family drama, whole thing

21:45.688 --> 21:49.591
and then you just
call me when you're free.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.761
Okay.

21:52.795 --> 21:53.862
Shake.

21:56.833 --> 21:58.133
All right.

21:58.167 --> 22:00.502
Madam.
Sir.

22:00.536 --> 22:01.937
Do your thing.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.514
Using our seven-year
friendship was low.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.850
I'm a publicist,
I use what I got.

22:14.884 --> 22:16.251
How long's your speech?

22:16.285 --> 22:17.853
I don't know, like, two minutes.
Good.

22:17.887 --> 22:19.488
These girls can get restless.

22:19.522 --> 22:22.023
Probably have ADHD or something.
You're crazy.

22:22.058 --> 22:24.159
No, I deliver and thanks
for making me look good.

22:24.193 --> 22:26.294
Ladies, I'd like for you
to meet your speaker

22:26.329 --> 22:28.163
for this afternoon,
Miss Mary Jane Paul.

22:28.197 --> 22:29.598
Hello.
Hi.

22:29.632 --> 22:31.833
And, Mary Jane, these are our
Atlanta chapter board members.

22:31.868 --> 22:33.869
Mary Jane, I love your show.

22:33.903 --> 22:34.936
Oh.

22:34.971 --> 22:37.305
I'm sure you hear that all the time.
Thank you.

22:37.340 --> 22:39.341
You're such a great
role model for our girls.

22:39.375 --> 22:42.344
And thank you so much for
coming on such short notice.

22:42.378 --> 22:43.545
It's my pleasure.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.548
What Girls Inc. does for the
community is really admirable.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.049
Is anyone sitting here?

22:48.084 --> 22:49.785
'Cause I'd hate to put my purse
in someone's seat.

22:49.819 --> 22:51.520
It's reserved for our
top financial donor.

22:51.554 --> 22:52.721
Oh!

22:52.755 --> 22:55.457
She raised something like
$1.7 million this year.

22:55.491 --> 22:56.725
Wow, that's impressive.

22:56.759 --> 22:59.094
Yeah, absolutely.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.896
I'm sorry, excuse me, guys.

23:00.930 --> 23:02.464
Oh, you're fine.

23:12.575 --> 23:15.744
I think you know everyone
here but Mary Jane.

23:15.778 --> 23:18.280
Mary Jane Paul is the host
of "Talkback" on SNC.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.714
Mary Jane.

23:19.749 --> 23:21.516
Mary Jane,
this is Avery Daniels.

23:21.551 --> 23:23.685
She was a partner at Cornwall
and Sullivan law firm

23:23.719 --> 23:26.488
and now she sits on our
financial advisory board.

23:26.522 --> 23:28.290
I guess I do.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.592
Yes, I do.

23:30.626 --> 23:31.860
How are you?
Hello.

23:31.894 --> 23:33.595
Hello, ladies.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.197
Ladies who lunch.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.468
Well, under Georgia law,

23:39.502 --> 23:41.336
any person purporting to
act on behalf of

23:41.370 --> 23:43.071
a corporation
could be held liable.

23:43.105 --> 23:45.507
So then my husband
could go to jail?

23:46.776 --> 23:49.010
Don't look so happy, Marcie.

23:49.045 --> 23:50.545
I thought it was all internal.

23:52.114 --> 23:54.416
I know how you feel.

23:54.450 --> 23:56.618
Mmm.

23:56.652 --> 23:59.354
Uh... I...

23:59.388 --> 24:02.022
recently found out that my
husband's been having an affair.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.493
Oh, Avery.
I'm so sorry.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.194
Truly.
No, it's... it's...

24:06.229 --> 24:08.830
That's something I wouldn't
wish on anyone.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.332
How did you find out?

24:10.366 --> 24:12.133
May I ask?

24:12.168 --> 24:13.768
Uh...

24:17.940 --> 24:19.574
...his mistress
told me.

24:19.609 --> 24:21.276
What?!

24:23.312 --> 24:25.247
Mary Jane.

24:26.282 --> 24:28.183
You seem knowledgeable
about these things.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.185
How would you handle it?

24:34.019 --> 24:36.300
I've heard that ladies dress
for each other and I don't...

24:36.325 --> 24:39.861
I don't know, I guess I would,
uh, up my sex game.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.429
Oh.

24:43.032 --> 24:44.299
Yeah, seriously.

24:44.333 --> 24:48.336
The number-two reason that men
cheat is bad sex.

24:48.371 --> 24:50.839
Years and years of bad sex.

24:50.873 --> 24:53.375
But before we get into all of
that, I know you all will be

24:53.409 --> 24:56.411
thrilled to hear
what our speaker has to say.

24:56.445 --> 24:59.381
So what's
the number-one reason?

24:59.415 --> 25:02.350
They simply have fallen out of
love with their wives.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.630
I'm not saying that
that's what happened to you...

25:05.655 --> 25:07.222
No, no, no, no.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.392
You know, I remember
reading somewhere that

25:10.426 --> 25:12.994
husbands rarely, if ever,

25:13.029 --> 25:15.730
leave their wives and children
for their romp partner.

25:15.765 --> 25:19.434
Yes, I've read that too, yeah.

25:19.468 --> 25:23.805
And, um, you know,
we're in couples therapy.

25:23.839 --> 25:25.941
It's, um, it's good.

25:25.975 --> 25:28.243
We're trying to
save our marriage.

25:28.277 --> 25:33.048
Everyone, please help me give
a warm welcome to my friend

25:33.082 --> 25:37.485
and host of "Talkback,"
Miss Mary Jane Paul.

25:40.222 --> 25:40.922
Good luck.

25:55.671 --> 25:59.474
You know, I had this great
little sisterhood speech

25:59.508 --> 26:01.376
all prepared, but I seem to have

26:01.410 --> 26:03.411
left it in my purse
at the table.

26:06.916 --> 26:09.918
I don't want to talk about
sisterhood today.

26:09.952 --> 26:11.653
I know there's a lot of
professional women here,

26:11.687 --> 26:15.624
but I want to speak to
the younger girls.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.859
You guys signed up
for this mentorship program

26:17.893 --> 26:21.029
because you want to be
successful.

26:21.063 --> 26:23.064
You want to be your mentors.

26:23.099 --> 26:27.135
Everybody tells you, "Do your
best so you can be number one."

26:28.804 --> 26:31.740
But there's another position.

26:31.774 --> 26:35.276
And I've found that
being number two

26:35.311 --> 26:38.880
gives you all glory
of being at the top

26:38.914 --> 26:42.083
without all the pressures of
the number-one spot.

26:43.819 --> 26:47.188
You see, the job
of any great number two

26:47.223 --> 26:51.993
is to figure out what
the number one is missing,

26:52.028 --> 26:54.462
what they refuse to see in what
they're doing wrong.

26:57.299 --> 27:01.169
So, you know,
take your time, learn.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.638
Be patient.

27:03.673 --> 27:06.141
Get better.

27:06.175 --> 27:10.812
You will get to where you're
supposed to be

27:10.846 --> 27:13.148
if you do the work.

27:13.182 --> 27:15.450
Because remember,
if you don't...

27:19.055 --> 27:20.388
...somebody else will.

27:22.324 --> 27:24.826
I'm Mary Jane Paul
and thank you for listening.

27:38.341 --> 27:39.507
Hey, Dad.

27:39.542 --> 27:40.842
What's up?

27:43.235 --> 27:45.437
Do you know what happened to
your mother's bracelet?

27:45.471 --> 27:46.838
No.

27:46.872 --> 27:49.232
But I've been trying to tell her
that Tracy didn't steal it.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.644
Did you steal it?

27:54.780 --> 27:56.948
Don't look at me like
Alice in Wonderland.

27:56.982 --> 27:58.450
We both know

27:58.484 --> 28:01.019
that you've done
worse things in the past.

28:01.053 --> 28:04.622
No, I didn't steal
Mom's bracelet.

28:07.426 --> 28:08.359
Okay.

28:10.463 --> 28:12.597
Here.

28:12.631 --> 28:14.566
You were supposed to
do that last week.

28:16.311 --> 28:18.112
A week ago you all
were patting me on the back

28:18.137 --> 28:19.804
saying how proud you were of me.

28:19.839 --> 28:22.674
Throwing a big old party
for having two years sober.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.542
Now you're gonna sit there
and accuse me of stealing.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.777
Couldn't very well
ask you to do it

28:25.811 --> 28:28.246
when you were celebrating
your sobriety, now could we?

28:28.280 --> 28:29.781
No, just after something
comes back missing.

28:29.815 --> 28:31.816
You take this test every month.

28:37.690 --> 28:38.923
This is the only rent

28:38.958 --> 28:41.559
your mother and I ask
of you, Patrick.

28:50.236 --> 28:54.172
I don't need to
take the test 'cause...

28:54.206 --> 28:56.774
I know it'll...

28:56.809 --> 28:58.042
come back dirty.

29:03.115 --> 29:04.582
God.

29:07.386 --> 29:11.256
I was two years clean
and I... slipped.

29:11.290 --> 29:12.757
I'm sorry, Dad.

29:12.791 --> 29:15.960
I messed up, but...

29:15.995 --> 29:17.629
I got straight the next day.

29:17.663 --> 29:18.830
Mmm.

29:18.864 --> 29:21.132
Went to my meeting.

29:24.837 --> 29:26.590
I didn't steal
that bracelet, though.

29:40.052 --> 29:42.220
Hey.

29:42.254 --> 29:43.521
So, uh, let me guess,

29:43.556 --> 29:47.959
you, uh, dropped your
phone in the toilet again

29:47.993 --> 29:50.695
and you're replacing it
tomorrow.

29:50.729 --> 29:52.263
Yep.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.936
Mark, I'm so sorry.

29:57.970 --> 30:01.105
I promise you...
Mary Jane, just...

30:01.140 --> 30:03.374
It's all right.

30:03.409 --> 30:05.743
It was never your
secret to have to hold.

30:08.347 --> 30:09.914
I forgive you.

30:12.451 --> 30:13.818
Ooh.

30:15.487 --> 30:18.122
Wow...
just like that?

30:19.725 --> 30:20.925
Just like that.

30:22.728 --> 30:25.530
I don't think I would have
forgiven you.

30:25.564 --> 30:30.101
Well... we are more
evolved creatures.

30:30.135 --> 30:31.769
True.
Yes.

30:34.506 --> 30:36.174
Enough of that.

30:36.208 --> 30:37.442
So...

30:38.877 --> 30:41.079
...what do you think?

30:41.113 --> 30:44.115
Uh, you look good?

30:44.149 --> 30:46.651
Kara's idea.

30:46.685 --> 30:49.854
Less stuffy black man,
no suit jacket.

30:49.888 --> 30:52.523
Oh, so this is her plan
to revamp your show. One of 'em.

30:52.558 --> 30:54.025
Okay.

30:54.059 --> 30:55.193
What do you think?

30:57.263 --> 30:58.730
Mmm...

30:58.764 --> 31:01.532
If you're not comfortable, don't do it.
Yeah.

31:01.567 --> 31:03.768
The team doesn't get
the bad emails, we do.

31:03.802 --> 31:07.639
And personally, I prefer you
in a suit jacket.

31:07.673 --> 31:09.407
Really?
Yes.

31:11.010 --> 31:13.044
Aren't you a sweetie?
I am.

31:16.949 --> 31:19.484
Well...

31:19.518 --> 31:21.586
I look forward to meeting
the guy who...

31:21.620 --> 31:22.854
finally gets you.

31:22.888 --> 31:25.189
Blah... that makes two of us.
Yes, it does.

31:25.224 --> 31:26.591
Give me some.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.894
After your
encounter with Mary Jane,

31:29.928 --> 31:32.530
I have to wonder
why you're here.

31:35.034 --> 31:36.968
Um...

31:37.002 --> 31:40.571
I'm... I'm not supposed
to be one of those women

31:40.606 --> 31:43.741
who wants a man
who cheats on her,

31:43.776 --> 31:46.077
who humiliates her.

31:46.111 --> 31:47.879
So why are you here?

31:49.448 --> 31:52.483
I'm... I'm here because...

31:52.518 --> 31:54.118
I've invested...

31:56.655 --> 31:59.824
...my life,
my career, my time,

31:59.858 --> 32:01.926
my everything into this
marriage.

32:04.367 --> 32:06.807
And all I hear women say is how
hard it is to find a good man,

32:06.832 --> 32:10.101
but, you know, I have one.

32:14.740 --> 32:17.942
He's...
he's a good father.

32:17.976 --> 32:20.011
He's a good provider.

32:21.547 --> 32:24.147
Sounds like Avery can pick out some
great qualities in you, Andre.

32:25.718 --> 32:27.752
And I'm thinking back
over the last six months

32:27.786 --> 32:29.354
since we started

32:29.388 --> 32:31.689
and you made a commitment
to your marriage, to me,

32:31.724 --> 32:33.791
to this process.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.860
And I'm wondering where
that commitment is

32:35.894 --> 32:38.930
and why you're still here.

32:42.768 --> 32:44.936
I don't really know
why I'm still here.

32:46.872 --> 32:49.207
Everything I say in here,
I've already said to her.

32:51.076 --> 32:53.611
I love her...

32:53.645 --> 32:56.147
and I just want her to love me.

32:56.181 --> 32:57.815
God, really?

32:59.151 --> 33:00.651
Andre, turn to
Avery and tell her.

33:14.666 --> 33:16.267
Avery...

33:18.270 --> 33:19.771
...I love you, baby.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.541
Then why are you cheating on me?

33:28.180 --> 33:29.580
She sees me.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.318
Not the me from 10 years ago.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.358
She... she sees me now.

33:42.661 --> 33:47.198
And she's fun
and spontaneous and...

33:47.232 --> 33:50.134
I don't think that's the real
heart of the argument,

33:50.169 --> 33:52.236
is it, Andre?

33:53.338 --> 33:54.705
The heart of the arg...
okay.

33:54.740 --> 33:57.442
You... you
talk about investment,

33:57.476 --> 33:59.777
what you've invested, Avery.

33:59.812 --> 34:03.748
Um, how you spruced me up,
how you corrected my grammar.

34:03.782 --> 34:06.417
Um, how you've introduced me
to the right people

34:06.452 --> 34:09.587
and married me despite
what your parents said.

34:09.621 --> 34:11.621
But what about what
I've invested?

34:11.657 --> 34:12.956
I've invested, too.

34:12.991 --> 34:15.493
I cook for you,
I study with you,

34:15.527 --> 34:18.728
I strategize with you,
I listen to you.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.164
I validate every move you make,

34:20.199 --> 34:23.868
from the kids to the house to me
to your charities, your friends,

34:23.902 --> 34:27.038
my business partners,
the school, family vacations,

34:27.072 --> 34:29.005
holiday decorations.

34:29.041 --> 34:34.378
Your decision to quit
or maybe go back to work.

34:40.819 --> 34:42.386
And what do I get?

34:47.559 --> 34:48.525
Nothing.

34:51.163 --> 34:52.964
Because I guess I still
haven't paid you back

34:52.998 --> 34:55.565
for marrying below
your... pay grade.

35:10.126 --> 35:13.462
Yeah, man, back then,
my ex was incorrigible.

35:13.496 --> 35:14.963
I guess she'd say the same thing

35:14.998 --> 35:16.598
about me back then, too.

35:16.633 --> 35:18.500
How long were you married?

35:18.535 --> 35:22.938
Five years, four months
and three days too long.

35:22.972 --> 35:25.040
Any kids?
No.

35:25.074 --> 35:27.943
Neither one of us wanted to
bring children into that.

35:27.977 --> 35:29.177
All right.

35:29.212 --> 35:30.712
I'm about to put
my Oprah hat on.

35:30.747 --> 35:32.581
Oh, okay.

35:32.615 --> 35:33.749
Mmm.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.417
All right, we're getting deep.
Yes.

35:35.451 --> 35:36.985
All right, come on, go.

35:39.455 --> 35:44.192
Okay, look, when I said
let's do a do-over date...

35:44.227 --> 35:46.194
...I meant just
the restaurant.

35:46.229 --> 35:48.096
Not a full reenactment, so...

35:48.131 --> 35:50.532
You have my full
and undivided attention.

35:50.567 --> 35:51.700
Okay.

35:54.437 --> 35:56.371
Do I still get my question?

35:56.406 --> 35:57.472
I'm game.

35:57.507 --> 35:59.808
Okay.
Okay.

35:59.842 --> 36:02.811
What did your
ex-wife teach you?

36:02.845 --> 36:04.913
What did my ex-wife teach me?
Yes.

36:04.948 --> 36:08.016
Ooh, that is a good question.
I know.

36:08.051 --> 36:09.585
Okay.

36:11.087 --> 36:13.422
I have to say the, uh...

36:13.456 --> 36:17.459
biggest lesson
probably is forgiveness.

36:17.493 --> 36:19.761
Yeah, forgiveness.

36:19.796 --> 36:22.297
Mainly of myself.

36:22.332 --> 36:24.132
What about you?

36:24.167 --> 36:25.500
Oh, yeah, we're gonna
turn this around.

36:25.535 --> 36:26.602
All right.

36:26.636 --> 36:29.137
All right, Mary Jane.

36:29.172 --> 36:31.540
Okay.

36:31.574 --> 36:35.277
What's the biggest mistake
you've ever made

36:35.311 --> 36:36.678
in a relationship?

36:36.713 --> 36:38.046
Go.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.918
Probably falling in love
with a married man.

36:44.354 --> 36:46.521
I mean, I did not know
he was married at the time.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.492
It's complicated.

36:50.526 --> 36:52.995
Affairs usually are.

36:53.029 --> 36:55.230
How'd you find out?

36:55.264 --> 36:56.565
I mean, there's no real
story there.

36:56.599 --> 36:58.400
I, um...

36:58.434 --> 37:00.869
I sort of stepped on
his wedding ring.

37:00.903 --> 37:02.104
What?
Yeah.

37:02.138 --> 37:04.906
Like, literally stepped
on his wedding ring.

37:04.941 --> 37:07.109
Wow.

37:07.143 --> 37:09.478
How long have you
been broken up?

37:09.512 --> 37:11.413
Not long.

37:11.447 --> 37:13.015
Huh.

37:13.049 --> 37:15.717
Do you ever see
your ex-wife?

37:15.752 --> 37:17.252
Yeah.

37:17.286 --> 37:19.354
After the divorce,
we became friends.

37:19.389 --> 37:21.189
Really?
Yes.

37:21.224 --> 37:25.027
See, there is life
after a bad relationship.

37:25.061 --> 37:26.795
You've just got to keep
searching for it.

37:36.572 --> 37:38.240
Oh, good, you found it.

37:39.542 --> 37:41.009
Where was it?

37:41.044 --> 37:43.712
In the laundry room
under some dirty linen.

37:43.746 --> 37:45.447
Oh.

37:45.481 --> 37:47.816
Wonder how it got there.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.085
Mm-hmm.

37:50.119 --> 37:51.753
Would you put it
on my wrist, please?

37:53.623 --> 37:55.590
Why'd you do it?

37:55.625 --> 37:57.626
Do what?

37:57.660 --> 37:59.327
Have us running all around
the house,

37:59.362 --> 38:00.862
kicking Tracy out,

38:00.897 --> 38:03.565
getting everybody all
worked up over nothing?

38:03.599 --> 38:05.067
It wasn't for nothing.

38:05.101 --> 38:09.571
I didn't want that
girl in my house anymore.

38:09.605 --> 38:11.373
So now she isn't.

38:48.878 --> 38:50.145
I had to see you.

38:50.179 --> 38:51.947
It's late, what do you want?
I want you.

38:54.117 --> 38:56.845
I want you, Mary Jane.

38:56.846 --> 38:58.987
I'm sorry for hurting you.
You said that.

38:59.021 --> 39:00.155
Many times.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.394
But I never said
I'm filing for divorce.

39:10.032 --> 39:11.533
I'm filing for divorce.

39:12.969 --> 39:14.870
I told Avery today.

40:00.815 --> 40:59.433
