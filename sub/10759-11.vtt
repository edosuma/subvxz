00:07.474 --> 00:09.476
FRASIER:
Previously on Frasier...

00:09.476 --> 00:10.810
There is absolutely
no reason

00:10.810 --> 00:13.213
this can't be connected
to some submerged anxiety.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.047
I mean, what's bothering you?

00:14.047 --> 00:15.849
The only women in my life
are friends.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.684
Roz and Daphne.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.019
Daphne's not even here anymore.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.020
She'll be married soon.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.489
It's been nice having her here.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.458
I really do love Daphne.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.995
DAPHNE:
It's about Dr. Crane.

00:28.995 --> 00:32.198
I overheard him say
he's in love with me.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.933
Geez, not this.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.468
You knew about this?

00:35.468 --> 00:36.970
I kept my mouth shut
for six years.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.938
I'm not saying
anything now.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.874
Of course
I love you, Daphne,

00:40.874 --> 00:43.276
but... as a friend, that's all.

00:43.276 --> 00:47.280
When I said to your father,
"Dr. Crane's in love with me,"

00:47.280 --> 00:50.150
he said it's been going on
for six years now.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.918
What did he mean by that?

00:51.918 --> 00:53.386
He meant Niles.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.389
He's crazy about you.

01:00.593 --> 01:01.594
Oh, good Lord, Dad.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.596
You've been tinkering
with that thing for hours.

01:03.596 --> 01:04.596
Now, don't you think

01:05.098 --> 01:07.467
maybe Dancin' Santa
could sit this Christmas out?

01:07.467 --> 01:10.737
Oh, I got to get him ready for
your big party tomorrow night.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.072
(doorbell rings)
Oh, no need, Dad.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.574
There'll be plenty of things
to delight my guests.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.576
We'll be caroling
and playing games.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.612
Oh, and I'll be reading
A Child's Christmas in Wales

01:19.612 --> 01:20.880
to bring the evening to a close.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.982
Oh, that should do it.

01:22.982 --> 01:25.318
Hey, Frasier.
Oh, hello, Roz.

01:25.318 --> 01:26.319
Hey, Martin.
MARTIN: Hey, Roz.

01:26.319 --> 01:27.821
I can't stay.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.322
I just stopped by to drop off
your punchbowl.

01:29.322 --> 01:30.323
Well, thank you, Roz.

01:30.323 --> 01:33.193
Say, what kind of punch
did you serve?

01:33.193 --> 01:35.061
Well, first I filled it
with ice.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.430
Then I just poured
orange juice and vodka over it.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.667
Well, Roz, that's
just a giant screwdriver.

01:40.667 --> 01:45.305
Yeah... so, what am
I, Martha Stewart?

01:45.305 --> 01:47.607
Fine. Thanks anyway.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.641
You know, I'm really going
to be needing

01:48.641 --> 01:49.642
this bowl tomorrow evening.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.644
There's going to be
a crowd of guests.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.079
I've invited
the entire building,

01:53.079 --> 01:55.148
including Cam Winston.
Oh...

01:55.148 --> 01:56.583
In the spirit of Christmas,
I've decided

01:56.583 --> 01:58.051
to put an end to our feud.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.319
What are you feuding about?

01:59.319 --> 02:02.222
Oh, he parks his SUV
right next to Frasier's Beemer.

02:02.222 --> 02:05.191
Yes, well, that car is
grotesquely oversized.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.426
I've often
been forced

02:06.426 --> 02:08.761
to exit from the passenger side.

02:08.761 --> 02:12.665
Many a time, I've been brought
to grief on my gear shift.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.101
Why doesn't he just back in?

02:15.101 --> 02:16.102
Are you kidding?

02:16.102 --> 02:17.604
He can barely hit that space

02:17.604 --> 02:19.973
even when the guy's car
isn't there.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.042
Hi, Roz.
ROZ: Hey, Daphne.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.844
Bye, guys.
FRASIER: Bye, Roz!

02:24.844 --> 02:26.312
You leaving?
ROZ: Yeah.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.749
Actually, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.118
What is it?

02:32.118 --> 02:33.186
The other day,

02:33.186 --> 02:35.121
I found out something
about Dr. Crane

02:35.121 --> 02:36.689
I wasn't supposed
to know.

02:36.689 --> 02:37.690
Frasier?

02:37.690 --> 02:39.025
No, his brother.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.861
Apparently, he's had a crush
on me for years.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.564
(sighing):
Thank God.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.132
What do you mean,
"thank God"?

02:46.132 --> 02:46.900
I've been afraid
for months

02:46.900 --> 02:48.668
I'd be the one
to blow the secret.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.836
You mean you knew?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.571
Well, everybody
kind of did.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.206
And nobody
said anything?

02:53.206 --> 02:55.074
Well, if Niles wasn't ready
to say anything,

02:55.074 --> 02:56.543
it wasn't our place
to do it.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.944
Well, who spilled
the beans?

02:57.944 --> 02:59.012
It was Frasier,
wasn't it?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.480
Yeah, but he doesn't
know he told me.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.015
He doesn't?
No, he was on

03:02.015 --> 03:03.816
those painkillers
for his back, and...

03:03.816 --> 03:06.653
well, I can't very well
discuss it with Dr. Crane.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.154
He's so close to Dr. Crane.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.622
If I told him,
he might tell Dr. Crane,

03:09.622 --> 03:12.458
and then Dr. Crane
might feel embarrassed.

03:12.458 --> 03:16.062
Yeah. Why confuse things?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.431
The whole thing's
just a bit awkward.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.133
Well, I don't see why.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.467
Niles has
a girlfriend now,

03:21.467 --> 03:23.436
so obviously
he's gotten over you,

03:23.436 --> 03:25.438
and you're engaged
to Donny.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.941
(chuckling): I suppose when you
look at it like that,

03:27.941 --> 03:30.276
there's really no
reason to feel awkward.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.112
Well, there's
a Christmas tableau--

03:33.112 --> 03:34.514
naughty and nice.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.417
Hello, Dr. Crane.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.418
Hello, Daphne.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.921
I'd see you inside,
but I just have to...

03:41.921 --> 03:44.424
take out the garbage.

03:44.424 --> 03:47.360
It's in my pockets.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.266
Morning, everyone.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.467
Hey, Niles.
Hello, Niles.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.736
Frasier, I brought those
caroling books you asked for.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.771
Ooh, thank you so much.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.273
Oh, yes, here we are.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.307
(chuckling)

04:01.307 --> 04:04.277
Preferred Songs from
a Victorian Christmas

04:04.277 --> 04:06.312
and Elizabethan
Tidings of Joy.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.814
Now we're ready
to party.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.781
(laughing)

04:08.781 --> 04:11.184
So, Niles, what
do you think?

04:11.184 --> 04:12.552
Should we start
with the caroling

04:12.552 --> 04:13.553
or should we hold off
until we've played

04:13.553 --> 04:15.455
a spirited game
of the Minister's Cat?

04:16.389 --> 04:18.391
Start with the game.
Uh-huh.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.392
Then the caroling.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.892
Then perhaps
the guests will be ready

04:20.892 --> 04:22.161
for another game.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.464
Yeah, Russian roulette.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.467
Yes, well, I'm off.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.969
Oh, Niles, if you're
not busy this evening,

04:29.969 --> 04:31.971
perhaps you could help me
string popcorn garlands.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.973
Uh, unfortunately,
I have to see Maris tonight.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.275
MARTIN:
Maris?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.576
What the hell
do you have to see her for?

04:36.576 --> 04:38.544
Sadly, to pay
my condolences.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.546
It seems
our old gardener

04:40.546 --> 04:41.948
has passed away
unexpectedly.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.416
Oh, not Yoshi.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.385
Gosh, that's too bad.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.353
He had a heart attack
when he was out trimming

04:47.353 --> 04:50.356
Maris' elaborate
hedge maze.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.660
The paramedics
never had a chance. No.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.697
Well, I feel bad about Yoshi,
but are you sure

04:57.697 --> 04:59.565
it's a good idea
spending the evening with Maris?

04:59.565 --> 05:00.933
Well, she's
terribly upset.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.435
Maris and Yoshi
were very close.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.937
In fact, I remember
he once made

05:04.937 --> 05:05.938
a topiary likeness
of her

05:06.439 --> 05:11.277
and wept without shame
when it developed root rot.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.879
Well...

05:12.879 --> 05:15.181
the problem is
I have to cancel on Mel tonight.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.182
Oh, really?

05:16.182 --> 05:17.684
Well, Niles, if
you want my advice,

05:17.684 --> 05:19.018
I wouldn't mention
Maris to Mel.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.853
What?

05:20.853 --> 05:22.255
The last thing a new girlfriend
wants to hear

05:22.255 --> 05:25.091
is that you're consoling
your ex-wife.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.393
Well, I hate
to lie to Mel...

05:27.393 --> 05:28.928
although I do see
your point, Frasier.

05:29.429 --> 05:30.229
(laughing):
Hey...

05:30.229 --> 05:33.533
there he goes.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.735
Dad, Santa's back.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.669
MARTIN:
Yeah.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.603
It's the darndest thing.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.105
Every year,
when I take him out of the box,

05:39.105 --> 05:40.106
something's wrong with him,

05:40.106 --> 05:41.607
but I always manage
to fix him again.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.910
NILES:
Oh, good for you, Dad.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.211
I told you to dunk it
under water.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.979
I did.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:55.788 --> 05:56.789
KENNY:
Hey, Doc.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.692
Merry Christmas.
Oh, hi, Kenny. My!

05:59.692 --> 06:01.561
The station has certainly
outdone itself this year

06:01.561 --> 06:04.430
with the Christmas-
in-Mexico theme.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.866
It was my idea.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.334
It hit me when
I realized

06:08.334 --> 06:09.869
their sauces are
red and green.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.804
(laughing):
Ah, well...

06:11.804 --> 06:14.073
that's why you are
the boss.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.875
(laughing)

06:15.875 --> 06:17.677
Hey, Frasier, what time's your
party tonight?

06:17.677 --> 06:18.945
Shh! Please,
keep your voice down.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.413
You're the only one
from the station I've invited.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.315
The only one?
Yes.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.783
Oh, don't worry,
there'll be scads of people,

06:23.783 --> 06:26.185
because I invited everyone
in my building. 7:00.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.453
Okay.
All right.

06:27.453 --> 06:28.654
Oh, Gil...

06:28.654 --> 06:29.522
Merry Christmas.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.023
And to you, Frasier.
Oh, thank you.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.525
I hope you saved
room for dessert.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.026
Have you been baking?

06:34.026 --> 06:36.028
I have.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.964
Gingerbread men.

06:37.964 --> 06:42.802
Oh, my, and don't they look...
muscular?

06:42.802 --> 06:44.704
Yes, well, the wife and I made
a new year's resolution.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.205
Mm-hmm. Deb and I have
joined a gym

06:46.205 --> 06:48.207
to slim down and buff up.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.709
We made these
to inspire us.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.676
Ah, yes.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.612
Nothing strengthens
a dieter's resolve

06:52.612 --> 06:54.614
like a good
motivational pastry.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.616
(laughing)
Precisely.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.117
Problem is, they're
so delicious,

06:58.117 --> 06:59.919
I've already had three.

06:59.919 --> 07:04.223
This is my last
little man, I promise.

07:04.223 --> 07:08.161
Mm! Oh, Gil, who
are you kidding?

07:09.061 --> 07:11.497
No one, Gil.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.567
Frasier...

07:14.567 --> 07:16.068
Mel?
Hello.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.070
Well, gosh, I never expected
to see you here.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.072
Oh, well, I was
one of the doctors

07:20.072 --> 07:22.875
on Health Chat
during cosmetic surgery week.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.978
I did a segment
on breast augmentation.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.547
Oh, how uplifting.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.948
(laughing)

07:28.948 --> 07:30.450
Yes, well...

07:30.450 --> 07:32.885
Niles is hanging up
our coats.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.754
So, did you two have
a good dinner last night?

07:34.754 --> 07:35.721
Oh, uh, no, no.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.223
Actually, we didn't
have dinner last night.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.724
I was too busy
planning my party.

07:38.724 --> 07:39.725
But, please,
don't mention that

07:39.725 --> 07:40.726
to any of my
colleagues.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.228
They're not invited.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.563
Mel?

07:43.563 --> 07:45.898
Frasier, Frasier,
glad I saw you.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.266
Listen, about last night--
if Mel should ask...

07:47.266 --> 07:48.568
Oh, dear.

07:48.568 --> 07:49.368
Oh, no.

07:49.368 --> 07:50.069
Oh, yes.

07:50.069 --> 07:50.903
And you...?

07:50.903 --> 07:52.405
I'm afraid so.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.773
Damn you!

07:53.773 --> 07:55.441
Well, I... You're the one who
told me to lie to her.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.276
Now you fail
to... back me up.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.277
Well, I'm
a little preoccupied.

07:58.277 --> 08:01.781
I'm having a party tonight
for 200 people!

08:03.282 --> 08:05.785
Well, I won't
lie to you, Doc.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.788
This hurts.

08:10.790 --> 08:11.791
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.292
Oh, Mel, Mel, darling,
please...

08:13.292 --> 08:14.794
darling, please, come
here, darling, sweetheart.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.129
Niles, Niles... I know you're upset,
darling, but listen.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.498
Please, we're at a party.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.899
All right, all
right, you're right.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.766
Uh, we'll talk
about it later.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.268
No, no, no,
we'll talk about it now.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.705
Just put on
your party face.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.273
Don't embarrass me...

08:27.273 --> 08:29.775
as if I could be
further embarrassed

08:29.775 --> 08:31.277
after you lied to me.

08:31.277 --> 08:32.144
I can explain.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.980
No, no, no, uh,
you don't need to.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.515
When a man lies
about where he's been,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.015
it's not hard
to guess the reason.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.018
So, what's
the little whore's name?

08:39.018 --> 08:41.020
(chuckling)

08:41.020 --> 08:43.022
No, no, no, darling,
the reason I told you

08:43.022 --> 08:44.524
that I was dining
with Frasier

08:44.524 --> 08:46.526
was actually,
I was out...

08:46.526 --> 08:48.394
Yes?

08:48.394 --> 08:51.097
...getting your
Christmas present.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.398
My present?
Uh-huh.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.901
Oh, darling,
I'm so sorry.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.369
I-I should've known.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.303
(laughing)
Oh!

08:57.303 --> 08:59.305
I'm so glad you're
forgiving me.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.306
(both laughing)

09:00.306 --> 09:01.807
Or is that your
party face?

09:01.807 --> 09:03.576
Oh, no, no.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.811
Of course not, darling.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.281
So, why don't you, um,
hang my coat back up... All right.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.782
and I'll get us
something to drink.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.651
Of course.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.419
FRASIER:
Oh, Mel...

09:13.419 --> 09:14.887
uh, this is awkward, uh...

09:14.887 --> 09:16.289
MEL:
Oh, no, no, no, Frasier.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.958
Niles explained
everything,

09:18.958 --> 09:21.193
and while I don't
like being lied to,

09:21.193 --> 09:22.995
I do appreciate
why he did it.

09:22.995 --> 09:23.796
FRASIER:
Oh, I'm so glad.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.631
Ooh, hello.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.933
Darling.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.901
Hello. Chatting,
are we?

09:28.901 --> 09:31.337
Well, actually,
I was just apologizing

09:31.337 --> 09:33.739
for my part
in your little misunderstanding.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.575
Oh, yes, well, then, of course you were
discussing the present?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.509
Oh, yes, yes,

09:36.509 --> 09:38.377
the present... and the future.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.279
Maris is all in the past.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.148
(chuckling)

09:42.148 --> 09:43.115
Maris?

09:43.115 --> 09:44.350
Oh, dear.

09:45.117 --> 09:48.621
You were with Maris
last night?

09:49.088 --> 09:51.057
Well...
How dare you?

09:52.491 --> 09:55.394
Anything else in the box,
Pandora?

09:58.097 --> 10:01.400
Mel, please. Oh, no,
don't touch me, no.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.668
Party face, party face.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.004
No, no, forget
the party face.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.740
You're obviously still...
in love with her,

10:07.740 --> 10:09.609
and I'm not
about to share you,

10:09.609 --> 10:13.112
so... good-bye.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.114
FRASIER:
Niles, Niles, I'm so sorry.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.616
Oh, Frasier,
don't pretend to be sorry.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
All you care about
is your precious party

10:18.618 --> 10:21.587
that you're hosting
tonight!

10:33.966 --> 10:36.469
("Jingle Bells"
playing on piano)

10:36.469 --> 10:38.904
Okay, honey, get ready.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.075
Don't be nervous.

10:43.075 --> 10:47.013
Okay, bring it
on home, Daphne!

10:47.013 --> 10:49.015
(plays final chord)
Yes!

10:49.015 --> 10:50.516
Daphne Moon, everybody!

10:51.851 --> 10:53.219
FRASIER:
Brava!

10:53.219 --> 10:54.987
Okay, we're taking requests.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.056
How about a little
"Silent Night"?

10:59.225 --> 11:00.593
FRASIER:
Stop that! Wha...?

11:00.593 --> 11:01.961
Those are for the party.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.764
In case you haven't noticed,
I am the party.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.566
Yeah, Frasier,
didn't the invitation say 7:00?

11:07.566 --> 11:09.535
I hope people knew
it was for tonight.

11:09.535 --> 11:10.503
Stop worrying.
They'll be here.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.971
I mean, they're probably
just fashionably late.

11:11.971 --> 11:12.905
I mean, people do love to make

11:12.905 --> 11:13.906
an entrance, you know.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.274
(doorbell rings)
A-ha!

11:15.274 --> 11:20.012
Daphne, open the floodgates.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.216
NILES:
Hello.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.152
Good evening, Dr. Crane.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.153
Isn't Mel with you?

11:27.153 --> 11:29.188
Uh, no, she
won't be coming.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.523
We broke up.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.657
What?

11:31.657 --> 11:33.225
NILES:
Yeah, uh, this afternoon.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.493
Oh, goodness,
I'm so sorry.

11:34.493 --> 11:35.895
Did you try to call her, Niles?

11:35.895 --> 11:37.329
Oh, I left a
dozen messages.

11:37.329 --> 11:38.230
DONNY: Aw, Niles,
I'm so sorry.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.566
How long were you guys together?

11:40.566 --> 11:42.334
Oh, not that long.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.804
Still, I was optimistic.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.272
Well, did you talk
about moving in together?

11:46.272 --> 11:48.040
Made any long-term plans?

11:48.040 --> 11:52.078
This is really bringing out
the lawyer in you, isn't it?

11:52.078 --> 11:53.345
The bartender, actually.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.313
I was just wondering

11:54.313 --> 11:57.316
how big a drink
to make you. Ah. Big.

11:57.316 --> 11:58.317
Scotch, please.

11:58.317 --> 11:59.285
All right, come on,
don't worry, Niles.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.820
We'll fix you up
with somebody.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.321
Oh, uh, thanks, Donny.

12:02.822 --> 12:03.322
I don't think
this is the time

12:03.823 --> 12:04.824
for me to be meeting
someone new.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.326
Someone old, then;
you know, an old flame...

12:07.326 --> 12:08.661
an ex-girlfriend,

12:08.661 --> 12:10.396
someone who got away, huh?

12:10.396 --> 12:12.198
Now, come on, Niles,

12:12.198 --> 12:13.032
there must
have been somebody

12:13.032 --> 12:14.567
you had your eye on
before Mel.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.968
Donny, please!

12:15.968 --> 12:18.370
Can't you see
you're making him uncomfortable?

12:18.370 --> 12:19.872
What? I was just
trying to help.

12:19.872 --> 12:20.873
Honey?

12:20.873 --> 12:22.374
See, Niles, it's not
us, it's the holidays.

12:22.374 --> 12:25.711
It makes women crazy.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.356
Ha-ha! Hello, everyone!

12:37.356 --> 12:38.724
Come in! Come in!

12:38.724 --> 12:40.159
Oh, yes, that's
very nice.

12:40.159 --> 12:43.095
Ladies first. All right, now,
no crowding, no pushing.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.597
(laughing)

12:46.932 --> 12:48.834
Where are they going?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.237
I've got bad
news for you.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.239
That feud you were having
with the guy upstairs?

12:53.239 --> 12:54.240
It isn't over.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.241
He's having
his own party.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.243
Damn him!

12:57.743 --> 13:00.012
He's siphoning
off my guests.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.781
You know, you won't
believe this.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.251
That dreadful Cam Winston
is having a competing party!

13:05.251 --> 13:06.619
DONNY: Oh, that's
what that was.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.021
I saw a big sign in the lobby:
"Winston Party 2000."

13:09.021 --> 13:10.956
Yes. That's his
apartment number.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.426
Well, two can play
at that game.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.427
Donny?
DONNY: Yeah?

13:15.928 --> 13:17.263
Do me a favor, will you?

13:17.263 --> 13:18.397
Make me one
of those signs.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.231
See what you can fashion

13:19.231 --> 13:20.733
out of these
crude implements.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.234
Okay, I'll try.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.570
MARTIN: I don't know if that's
a good idea, Fras.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.438
FRASIER: Why?
Well, "Winston Party 2000"

13:26.438 --> 13:28.440
sounds like the
party of the future.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.910
"Crane Party 1901"...

13:30.910 --> 13:33.112
sounds like...

13:33.112 --> 13:35.281
well, this.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.683
I wouldn't worry
about it, Frasier.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.485
You always throw
a good party.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.220
This place will be hopping
in no time.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.054
FRASIER:
Thanks, Roz.

13:42.054 --> 13:45.457
Hey, Connie, it's a morgue here.

13:45.457 --> 13:48.894
Is the party at the station
still happening?

13:48.894 --> 13:51.931
Great. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.299
Oh, hey, Daphne.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.134
You're not going
to believe this.

13:55.134 --> 13:56.569
Dr. Crane broke up
with Mel.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.470
Oh, yeah, I know. I heard.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.674
Is there anything
you don't know before I do?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.876
I overheard them
at the office Christmas party.

14:03.876 --> 14:04.944
Really? What happened?

14:05.444 --> 14:08.214
Well, okay...
don't freak out.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.014
Mel accused Niles

14:09.014 --> 14:10.950
of still being in love
with someone else.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.886
Oh, my God, that's me!
I'm "someone."

14:13.886 --> 14:14.720
I said not
to freak out.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.488
But what if he says something
to me?

14:16.488 --> 14:17.957
Just let him down gently.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.892
Oh, it never works out
that easily.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.127
You know what happens
when you say no to a guy.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.930
Yeah. Sure.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.200
It just gets messy
after that.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.202
You say you'll be friends,
but you never are.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.637
It ruins everything.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.572
He's not going to
say anything tonight.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.541
As long as Donny's here,
you're totally safe.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.476
Let's find a prominent
place to put this...

14:37.476 --> 14:41.814
preferably right on top
of Winston's sign.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.616
Oh, go easy there,
Niles.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.385
Oh, haven't you given me enough
advice for one day?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.153
(oven bell rings)
My canapes!

14:48.153 --> 14:51.156
You know, Niles, you look
like you need cheering up.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.157
Oh!
Oh, no! Oh, no!

14:52.157 --> 14:54.159
Oh, darn, I'm sorry.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.661
Daphne's present.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.029
Did it break?

14:57.029 --> 14:59.965
(broken pieces clattering)

14:59.965 --> 15:04.436
Well, we won't know
till she opens it.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.405
I'm sorry...
but, hey, look.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.707
You don't need this one
for Mel, do you?

15:08.707 --> 15:10.809
Well, I guess not.
Oh, okay, well, here.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.545
Switch that in there
for this right here.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.080
Problem solved.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.948
All right,
now, you two,

15:15.948 --> 15:17.349
I don't want everyone
congregating

15:17.349 --> 15:18.350
in the kitchen.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.853
Now, go out
and mingle!

15:22.354 --> 15:25.357
Niles! Martin!
I didn't see you come in.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.792
Roz! Daphne!

15:26.792 --> 15:29.094
Well, I didn't want

15:29.094 --> 15:31.030
to give these out
in front of all the guests,

15:31.030 --> 15:32.998
but since there
aren't any... here you go.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.500
Roz, that's for you,

15:34.500 --> 15:35.935
and, uh, Daphne, here.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.670
Uh... Merry Christmas.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.505
Oh, Merry Christmas.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.506
Thank you.
(phone ringing)

15:40.506 --> 15:42.508
Excuse me.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.009
Hello?

15:44.009 --> 15:47.513
Oh, no. It's jewelry.

15:47.513 --> 15:51.016
Oh, no. It's a book.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.888
My God, there must be
100 people up there.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.257
Well, I'll just show you
what you're missing!

15:58.257 --> 16:01.760
Savory lamb tenders!

16:01.760 --> 16:05.230
Pesto-filled mushroom caps!

16:05.230 --> 16:07.266
Smell 'em and weep!

16:07.266 --> 16:08.767
Come on, come on,
Frasier.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.769
Maybe we ought
to walk you back inside.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.538
Oh, Dad...

16:12.538 --> 16:13.806
There you go.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.808
Yes. Yes, darling,
that's wonderful.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.310
I'll see you soon.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.311
That was Mel.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.612
And?

16:20.612 --> 16:22.381
I managed to explain
about Yoshi.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.382
She's on her way over.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.284
FRASIER:
Oh, thank God. I know.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.019
Another guest!

16:28.220 --> 16:30.456
It's also wonderful for you,
Niles-- congratulations.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.858
Well, there is one minor detail
to be ironed out.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.360
Yes? I also got a
message from Maris

16:34.360 --> 16:35.260
saying she wants
to see me again.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.562
I think she
may have

16:36.562 --> 16:39.465
mistaken last night's sympathy
for affection.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.466
FRASIER:
Oh, my.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.934
Well, Niles,
if you want my advice...

16:41.934 --> 16:44.636
Ooh, you know, you really need
to stop saying that.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.505
You've got to make
your feelings clear to her,

16:46.505 --> 16:47.539
and the sooner,
the better.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.008
I mean, there's
very little point

16:49.008 --> 16:50.843
in letting it drag on
like this. You're right.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.878
I'll speak to
her tonight.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.146
At the moment,
I just want

16:54.146 --> 16:55.647
to patch things
up with Mel.

16:55.647 --> 16:56.615
Uh-huh. Well, you know,

16:56.615 --> 16:57.649
those antique earrings
you bought her

16:57.649 --> 16:58.951
should go a long way
toward that.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.185
(groaning):
Oh...

17:00.185 --> 17:01.987
I gave them to Daphne.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.088
You did what?

17:03.088 --> 17:04.923
Daphne's gift broke, and...

17:04.923 --> 17:06.925
I didn't think Mel was coming.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.827
Dad suggested
I switch the gift cards.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.696
Oh, for God's sake,
Dad and his meddling.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.698
Well, if you want my advice...

17:14.465 --> 17:16.234
...you know where
to find me.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.806
Roz!
What?

17:20.806 --> 17:22.307
You can't go.
Why not?

17:22.307 --> 17:24.609
NILES: Daphne, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.377
Uh, I need to
speak with you.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.347
It's a private
matter. Uh...

17:28.347 --> 17:30.783
Would you join me on the balcony
for a moment?

17:30.783 --> 17:31.683
All right.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.152
Thank you.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.755
Whoa, he's going
to tell you.

17:36.755 --> 17:41.060
(sarcastically): Oh, no. Not tonight.
Not while Donny's here.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.494
Okay, so I was wrong.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.496
Boy, this is rough.

17:44.496 --> 17:45.898
What are you going to do?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.801
I don't know.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.203
I guess I won't
give him the chance.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.138
I'll speak first.
I'll just be direct.

17:53.138 --> 17:55.641
I'll... I'll tell him
I know how he feels about me

17:55.641 --> 17:57.643
but I don't feel that way
about him.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.645
I love Donny, and...

17:59.645 --> 18:02.014
nothing's going
to happen between us.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.348
Good...

18:03.348 --> 18:05.851
luck.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.290
Hi.
Daphne, uh...

18:11.290 --> 18:13.358
I wish there were an
easier way to say this.

18:13.358 --> 18:14.827
I...
Wait.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.830
I have something
that I'd like to say first.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.633
Dr. Crane, I have
to tell you that...

18:22.434 --> 18:24.436
Oh, Daphne, I
am so sorry.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.405
What am I thinking?

18:26.405 --> 18:27.739
Here.
Oh.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.042
Well, thank you.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.847
Anyway, Dr. Crane...

18:34.847 --> 18:37.349
I know that...

18:38.851 --> 18:40.853
Yes?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.856
I'm sorry. I...

18:43.856 --> 18:46.825
Look, uh, why don't
I start. Uh...

18:46.825 --> 18:47.826
No, Dr. Crane.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.328
No, no, I really
need to say this.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.696
I can't wait any
longer. Daphne...

18:50.696 --> 18:52.831
Yes?
Uh...

18:52.831 --> 18:54.566
This is so
difficult for me.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.502
Yes?

18:58.036 --> 19:00.873
I need my Christmas
present back.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.675
You what?

19:03.675 --> 19:07.679
People will go
almost anywhere

19:07.679 --> 19:10.549
for free food
and booze.

19:10.549 --> 19:13.752
Am I really so insufferable?

19:13.752 --> 19:15.053
I could call the station

19:15.053 --> 19:17.422
and see if people
want to come over.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.258
Oh, yes, Roz, let's call in
the second-string guests.

19:19.258 --> 19:23.629
Let's fill my home with a bunch
of angry, snubbed coworkers.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.466
You think they'd come?

19:27.466 --> 19:29.401
Ah!
Hey-hey!

19:29.401 --> 19:30.936
Hi! Merry Christmas!

19:30.936 --> 19:32.437
See? Fashionably late!

19:32.437 --> 19:33.438
Hello, everyone!

19:33.939 --> 19:34.940
Come in! Merry Christmas!

19:34.940 --> 19:36.942
Help yourself
to some drinks.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.277
Okay, Marty,

19:38.277 --> 19:39.645
how'd you get these
people down here?

19:39.645 --> 19:41.146
Oh, I just called an old buddy
in the fire department

19:41.146 --> 19:42.648
and told them
that that many people

19:42.648 --> 19:44.149
in one place
had to be a code violation.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.651
Oh, that is smart, but
aren't there going to be

19:45.651 --> 19:46.652
the same number of
people down here?

19:46.652 --> 19:47.586
All right, everyone,

19:47.586 --> 19:49.555
we'll start by
singing some carols,

19:49.555 --> 19:51.990
and then we'll choose up teams for
the Minister's Cat.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.927
I don't think
that's going to be a problem.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.864
I feel terrible about this,

19:58.864 --> 20:01.300
and-and, of course,
I'll-I'll replace the gift.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.268
Oh, that's all right.

20:03.268 --> 20:07.005
Well, I won't
be needing this anymore.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.841
Right. Oh, Daphne,
Daphne, Daphne...

20:09.841 --> 20:12.177
you never finished
what you were going to say.

20:12.177 --> 20:16.615
Oh, well... it was
about the gift.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.116
Well, I could see
from the box

20:18.116 --> 20:20.118
that you got me jewelry
from Beadie & Sons,

20:20.118 --> 20:23.622
and I didn't get you anything
nearly as grand.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.124
Well...
doesn't matter now.

20:27.626 --> 20:29.394
Oh. Mel...

20:29.394 --> 20:30.195
She's here.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.197
Yes, uh... excuse me.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.372
I'm so glad you came.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.673
Uh...

20:41.673 --> 20:43.875
Merry Christmas.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.043
Merry Christmas.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.015
So, how'd it go?
Did you tell him?

20:50.015 --> 20:52.884
I never got the chance.
He went first.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.386
It turns out he'd
just given me the wrong gift

20:54.386 --> 20:55.354
and wanted it back.

20:55.354 --> 20:56.355
You're kidding.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.257
You must be
so relieved.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.658
(chuckling):
Oh, I'll say.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.127
I've never been
so relieved in my life.

21:02.127 --> 21:05.430
