01:13.558 --> 01:16.402
And today the city
welcomes emperor Allister,

01:16.403 --> 01:18.243
ruler of Malacuria,

01:18.244 --> 01:20.086
and his daughter, princess Mallory.

01:20.087 --> 01:22.964
The emperor is here
to sell the mining rights

01:22.965 --> 01:25.576
to a newly discovered

01:25.577 --> 01:27.082
in his native Malacuria.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.927
Harder than diamond,
more beautiful than gold,

01:29.928 --> 01:31.768
Lidium 90 just may be

01:31.769 --> 01:33.777
rhe most valuable element on earth.

01:33.778 --> 01:36.957
This is April O'Neill, channel 6 news.

01:36.958 --> 01:39.301
April, I thought channel 6

01:39.302 --> 01:41.477
was supposed to report happy news.

01:41.478 --> 01:43.653
Ohh, i'm sorry.

01:43.654 --> 01:45.996
But when I hear about diamonds 
and gold,

01:45.997 --> 01:48.507
I can only think of one thing...

01:48.508 --> 01:49.846
an engagement ring,

01:49.847 --> 01:51.520
which, as you can see,

01:51.521 --> 01:54.030
I've got a severe shortage of.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.871
We'll talk about it later, Irma.

01:55.872 --> 01:57.713
Right now i've got
to cover the party

01:57.714 --> 01:59.354
at the malacurian embassy tonight.

01:59.355 --> 02:02.400
You're not going like

02:02.401 --> 02:04.877
Well, of course.
What's wrong ?

02:04.878 --> 02:06.818
You can't go to a fancy party

02:06.819 --> 02:08.157
looking like that.

02:08.158 --> 02:10.334
Come on, i'll have you
looking like a new woman

02:10.335 --> 02:11.506
in no time.

02:11.507 --> 02:14.519
Why would I want to
look like a new woman ?

02:14.520 --> 02:17.297
'Cause it's the best way
to find a new man.

02:21.382 --> 02:22.553
Oh, Krang,

02:22.554 --> 02:24.896
this cooling system you built is 
useless.

02:24.897 --> 02:28.479
It's hotter than japanese
horseradish in here.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.487
And now another
capacitator is down.

02:30.488 --> 02:33.098
The Technodrome needs more power !

02:33.099 --> 02:36.614
I think I know where we can 
find some.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.187
Where ?

02:38.188 --> 02:39.459
Lidium 90

02:39.460 --> 02:42.807
is the most powerful source 
of energy

02:42.808 --> 02:44.648
yet found on this miserable earth.

02:44.649 --> 02:46.657
Even a fragment this small

02:46.658 --> 02:48.163
would power the Technodrome

02:48.164 --> 02:50.506
out of this inferno.

02:50.507 --> 02:53.519
If it's that valuable,
it will be heavily guarded.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.757
How will we get it ?

02:54.758 --> 02:59.143
I'll think of something.
I always do.

03:02.626 --> 03:05.136
Oh, what is that, sensei ?

03:05.137 --> 03:08.249
It's called tekamaki...
Raw tuna roll.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.756
Have some, Michelangelo.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.333
Major gross out.
No, thanks.

03:12.334 --> 03:14.107
A wise person embraces

03:14.108 --> 03:16.786
as many new experiences
as possible.

03:16.787 --> 03:18.124
Master Splinter,

03:18.125 --> 03:20.133
perhaps you'd like
to try some pizza.

03:20.134 --> 03:22.309
It's marshmallow and pepperoni.

03:23.315 --> 03:25.322
The wise person also realizes

03:25.323 --> 03:26.829
that some experiences

03:26.830 --> 03:29.339
are less embraceable than others.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.851
Talk about embraceable.

03:31.852 --> 03:33.524
Who is that ?

03:33.525 --> 03:35.165
Hi, guys. It's me.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.847
Gosh, April just like a...

03:38.848 --> 03:40.286
You look lovely.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.964
Truly tubuloso.

03:42.965 --> 03:44.538
Yeah, you clean up real good.

03:44.539 --> 03:47.317
April, you make this ancient rodent

03:47.318 --> 03:48.656
feel young again.

03:48.657 --> 03:50.229
Thanks, guys.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.673
You're all just a bunch
of big green sweeties,

03:52.674 --> 03:54.849
and you're the nicest rodent I know.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.996
And now i'm off
to the malacurian embassy

03:57.997 --> 03:59.436
to cover a fancy party.

03:59.437 --> 04:02.214
I think we should keep an eye on her.

04:02.215 --> 04:03.721
Better yet, two.

04:03.722 --> 04:05.059
Mondo notion, dude.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.734
Well, what are we waiting for ?

04:06.735 --> 04:07.704
Let's go.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.023
Watch my shell, buddy.

04:14.937 --> 04:17.781
Father, I will not be
chauffeured about

04:17.781 --> 04:20.793
and looked after like a child.

04:20.795 --> 04:22.970
You are the princess of Malacuria,

04:22.971 --> 04:25.548
and you will not leave
this embassy unescorted.

04:25.549 --> 04:28.828
Now please prepare
for the masquerade.

04:28.829 --> 04:31.005
I hate masquerades !

04:31.006 --> 04:35.188
You always make me go
as a princess.

04:37.868 --> 04:39.172
Oh, no.

04:39.173 --> 04:41.516
It's

04:41.517 --> 04:43.759
Now i'll have to go home and 
change.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.767
Just a moment, you !

04:45.768 --> 04:48.312
What's going on here ?

04:48.313 --> 04:49.885
Oh, i'm sorry, your highness.

04:49.886 --> 04:51.359
I didn't know it was you.

04:52.364 --> 04:53.601
But i'm not...

04:53.602 --> 04:55.542
You should not be out here alone.

04:55.543 --> 04:56.915
You must come with us.

04:56.916 --> 04:58.890
It is time to dress for the masquerade.

04:58.891 --> 05:01.703
Sure, fellas.
Whatever you say.

05:07.161 --> 05:09.770
This is a real great plan, boss.

05:09.771 --> 05:12.683
Oh, yeah.
I love this plan.

05:12.684 --> 05:14.524
What was it again ?

05:14.525 --> 05:16.633
The plan, you pathetic peons,

05:16.634 --> 05:18.475
is to kidnap princess Mallory

05:18.476 --> 05:21.153
and ransom her for the lidium 90.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.994
If you followed my instructions,

05:22.995 --> 05:24.399
we should be directly beneath

05:24.400 --> 05:26.442
the embassy basement.

05:33.541 --> 05:37.422
You cretins.
This isn't the basement !

05:37.423 --> 05:39.431
What's going on there ?

05:39.432 --> 05:41.507
Quickly, hide the module.

05:46.395 --> 05:48.470
Are you here for the costume ball ?

05:48.471 --> 05:51.617
Costume ball ?
What costume...

05:51.618 --> 05:53.291
Of course we are.

05:53.292 --> 05:55.099
You will take us there at once.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.805
As you wish.

05:58.179 --> 05:59.652
Nice costumes, sir...

05:59.653 --> 06:03.033
Especially the, creatures.

06:03.034 --> 06:05.978
Thank you.
I made them myself.

06:05.979 --> 06:07.853
Well, Donatello, what do you see ?

06:07.854 --> 06:10.163
Shredder and his 2 freakazoids.

06:10.164 --> 06:13.009
Guys, I think we better
take a closer look.

06:13.010 --> 06:16.490
Right, dudes.
Let's scope out the action.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.261
Oh, another princess costume.

06:25.262 --> 06:28.241
This is so boring.

06:28.242 --> 06:31.622
Father will be furious,
But i'd rather see the city

06:31.623 --> 06:33.965
Than a bunch
Of stuffy officials

06:33.966 --> 06:35.572
In some silly costumes.

06:37.849 --> 06:39.990
Good evening,
Your highness.

06:39.991 --> 06:42.301
Hmm, i could get
To like this.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.314
Your highness ?
Hello ?

06:47.825 --> 06:50.034
As long as everyone
Thinks i'm the princess,

06:50.035 --> 06:52.009
I might as well
Go along with it.

06:52.010 --> 06:54.922
Maybe i can get
An exclusive story out of this.

06:58.069 --> 07:02.052
Oh, why couldn't we
Stay at the party, boss ?

07:02.053 --> 07:04.094
We're real
Party animals.

07:04.095 --> 07:06.438
They also had
My favorite chow--

07:06.439 --> 07:09.082
Shrimp puffs
And cheese dip.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.790
If you don't stop whining,

07:10.791 --> 07:14.104
I'll dip you in something
A lot less pleasant than cheese.

07:14.105 --> 07:16.849
This is it:
The princess' room.

07:18.791 --> 07:21.369
What a time
For the turtlecom.

07:23.378 --> 07:25.151
April here.
What's up ?

07:25.152 --> 07:27.193
April,
Are you all right ?

07:27.194 --> 07:29.838
We just spotted shredder
And his 2 henchmutants.

07:29.839 --> 07:32.416
Oh, you fellas are
So sweet to worry about me.

07:32.417 --> 07:33.922
I'm in princess
Mallory's room

07:33.923 --> 07:35.931
On the trail
Of a hot story--

07:35.932 --> 07:37.103
Grab her !

07:37.104 --> 07:38.575
With pleasure.

07:38.576 --> 07:42.292
Let go of me, you--oh !

07:42.293 --> 07:44.468
April ? April ?

07:44.469 --> 07:47.045
April, answer me !

07:50.327 --> 07:52.335
April !

07:52.336 --> 07:55.113
She doesn't answer.
Something's wrong.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.858
Yeah, and that something
Sounds like shredder.

07:57.859 --> 07:59.063
Ooh, that does it.

07:59.064 --> 08:00.905
We've got
To get in that place.

08:00.906 --> 08:02.076
Like how ?

08:02.077 --> 08:04.487
We're not exactly first
On the guest list.

08:04.488 --> 08:06.093
Hey, chill out, dudes.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.504
This won't be the first
Party we've crashed.

08:08.505 --> 08:10.914
Michelangelo's right.
Let's do it !

08:18.716 --> 08:21.593
I think that's where
We need to be.

08:25.779 --> 08:27.754
Up you go.

08:27.755 --> 08:29.394
Which way now ?

08:29.395 --> 08:34.248
Hey, i smell...pizza !
That way.

08:34.249 --> 08:36.725
Pizza ?
At an embassy party ?

08:36.726 --> 08:37.897
Hey, bud,

08:37.898 --> 08:40.909
You can be a head honcho
And still have good taste.

08:44.861 --> 08:49.781
Wow, dudes !
Fabuloso blast !

08:49.782 --> 08:52.727
Too bad we won't have
Time to enjoy it.

08:52.728 --> 08:54.200
We're here
To find april.

08:58.218 --> 08:59.356
Faster, you fools !

08:59.357 --> 09:02.000
We must get the princess
Back to the technodrome.

09:02.001 --> 09:05.147
Ooh ooh, you mean before
It turns into a pumpkin ?

09:05.148 --> 09:08.093
That was a different
Princess, you bimbo.

09:08.094 --> 09:11.106
All them princesses
Look alike to me.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.224
Stop !

09:15.225 --> 09:16.596
Where are you
Taking the princess ?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.542
We ain't got time

09:22.556 --> 09:24.195
Going down ?

09:24.196 --> 09:27.677
Please face the front
Of the car. 

09:28.917 --> 09:29.920
Mallory ?

09:29.921 --> 09:32.598
Mallory, my dear,
Are you ready ?

09:32.599 --> 09:34.104
Mallory !

09:35.947 --> 09:37.385
There's a note
Of some sort.

09:40.466 --> 09:42.474
"we have the princess.

09:42.475 --> 09:45.487
We will trade her
For your lidium 90."

09:45.488 --> 09:46.859
Guards !

09:46.860 --> 09:49.638
Princess mallory
Has been kidnapped !

09:49.639 --> 09:50.809
Seal all the exits.

09:50.810 --> 09:54.292
No one leaves this embassy
Until she's found.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.266
Immediately,
Your grace.

09:57.908 --> 09:59.112
What's this ?

10:00.585 --> 10:03.028
It looks like
Some kind of turtle shell.

10:03.029 --> 10:05.841
I'll take this.
Perhaps it's a clue.

10:09.055 --> 10:12.067
They must be sealing off
The escape routes.

10:12.068 --> 10:13.775
Blast through the floor !

10:16.822 --> 10:18.328
Quickly !

10:18.329 --> 10:21.508
Does this mean we don't
Get no shrimp puffs ?

10:31.285 --> 10:34.999
What
A marvelous costume.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.907
Would you
Care to dance ?

10:36.908 --> 10:39.284
Well, actually, no.

10:41.193 --> 10:42.867
How very scintillating.

10:42.868 --> 10:46.013
What do you
Call that step ?

10:46.014 --> 10:47.921
Turtle twirl.

10:49.395 --> 10:52.240
All right !
Finally !

10:52.241 --> 10:53.579
Do you see april ?

10:53.580 --> 10:56.357
No. Something better.

10:56.358 --> 10:57.864
It's pizza !

11:00.208 --> 11:02.350
Or at least it will be
When it grows up.

11:02.351 --> 11:03.990
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:03.991 --> 11:05.966
No one is to leave
This embassy.

11:05.967 --> 11:08.711
Princess mallory
Has been kidnapped.

11:08.712 --> 11:10.987
Oh, i bet
Old shredhead's

11:10.988 --> 11:12.560
Grabbed her, too.

11:12.561 --> 11:15.406
April said she was
In the princess' room.

11:15.407 --> 11:16.912
Maybe she saw
Something.

11:16.913 --> 11:20.427
Excuse us, lady.
Emergency.

11:20.428 --> 11:21.532
Yeah, sorry.

11:21.533 --> 11:22.771
Our dance card
Is full.

11:22.772 --> 11:25.382
Kindly cooperate
By showing your invitations

11:25.383 --> 11:27.022
And removing
Your face masks.

11:27.023 --> 11:30.906
Major problemo,
Dudes.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.747
We don't
Have invitations.

11:32.748 --> 11:33.751
Worse than that,

11:33.752 --> 11:35.592
We don't have
Face masks.

11:35.593 --> 11:37.634
Maybe we can slip out
In the confusion.

11:40.247 --> 11:41.283
Gentlemen,

11:41.284 --> 11:43.259
You will please
Remove your masks.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.300
Heh. Whatever you say.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.485
Your face masks,
Please.

11:50.490 --> 11:51.962
That hurts, bud.

11:51.963 --> 11:55.343
Soldiers, they must have
Dropped this shell

11:55.344 --> 11:56.850
In mallory's room.

11:56.851 --> 11:59.160
Guards, seize them !

11:59.161 --> 12:00.299
Come on !
Oof !

12:01.672 --> 12:05.387
It's a lovely party,
But we really can't stay.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.634
Please

12:10.945 --> 12:16.033
Cowabunga !

12:17.439 --> 12:19.581
Excitable group,
Aren't they ?

12:21.691 --> 12:23.632
This will hold them.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.607
Now to find april.

12:25.608 --> 12:28.285
And the princess--
Wherever she is.

12:37.593 --> 12:40.672
Reporter: and to repeat
Tonight's top story,

12:40.673 --> 12:43.082
Princess mallory
Has been kidnapped

12:43.083 --> 12:44.555
From the malacurian
Embassy.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.434
No, i haven't.

12:47.435 --> 12:48.840
Oh, poor father.

12:48.841 --> 12:51.652
I've got to get back
To the embassy.

12:51.653 --> 12:53.928
Taxi, taxi !

12:57.779 --> 13:01.896
Bebop, blast the doors.

13:01.897 --> 13:03.235
We're in the basement.

13:03.236 --> 13:06.148
Now to find a way
Out of here.

13:06.149 --> 13:11.605
Ooh ! Oh, let me go,
You slobbering beast.

13:11.606 --> 13:14.416
Just wait till the turtles
Get their hands on you.

13:14.417 --> 13:17.530
Wait. That voice--
It sounds familiar.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.137
Just as i thought.

13:19.138 --> 13:21.112
This isn't
Princess mallory,

13:21.113 --> 13:22.618
You moronic mutants.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.459
It's april o'neill.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.502
The dame reporter ?

13:26.503 --> 13:28.243
What are we
Gonna do, boss ?

13:28.244 --> 13:32.494
We're going to make
The best of a bad situation.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.536
Shredder,
Everywhere you go

13:34.537 --> 13:36.612
Is a bad situation.

13:36.613 --> 13:39.457
P.a.: attention, kidnappers.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.399
I have the lidium 90
In a helicopter

13:41.400 --> 13:43.575
Waiting for you
On the embassy roof.

13:43.576 --> 13:45.651
Please let my daughter go !

13:45.652 --> 13:47.592
They think we
Have the princess.

13:47.593 --> 13:50.002
Oh, i have an idea.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.944
Unh ! Well,
So have i !

13:51.945 --> 13:53.417
After her !

14:00.381 --> 14:02.991
She got away.

14:02.992 --> 14:04.631
After her,
You klutzes !

14:04.632 --> 14:07.678
If shredder heard
That announcement,

14:07.679 --> 14:09.319
He's on his way
To the roof.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.524
How do we get there ?

14:10.525 --> 14:13.034
This place has more twists
Than a pretzel factory.

14:13.035 --> 14:15.578
I have a feeling
It's that way.

14:17.555 --> 14:18.692
Halt !

14:18.693 --> 14:20.968
Hands in the air
Or we'll open fire.

14:20.969 --> 14:23.848
Well, so much
For feelings.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.849
For the last time,
Where is the princess ?

14:31.850 --> 14:34.694
Well, fellas, i guess
We have to tell them.

14:34.695 --> 14:37.540
All: she went that way !

14:37.541 --> 14:39.146
Seize them !

14:39.147 --> 14:42.026
Stop ! Leave them alone.

14:42.027 --> 14:45.708
Oh, april, are we
Glad to see you.

14:45.709 --> 14:46.812
April ?
What ?

14:46.813 --> 14:49.256
April ? Who is april ?

14:49.257 --> 14:50.763
You are, remember ?

14:50.764 --> 14:51.868
Maybe that new hairdo

14:51.869 --> 14:53.676
Is pulling your brain
Too tight.

14:53.677 --> 14:54.881
Mind how you speak

14:54.882 --> 14:56.789
To the princess
Of malacuria.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.295
The princess ?

14:58.296 --> 15:01.408
I have heard tales
Of you turtles,

15:01.409 --> 15:03.752
But i am curious
As to why you are here.

15:03.753 --> 15:06.430
We're searching for
Our friend a

15:06.431 --> 15:08.640
She looks just like you,
Your highness.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.146
Yeah, so much so
That we think

15:10.147 --> 15:12.055
She got kidnapped
Instead of you.

15:12.056 --> 15:13.662
Oh, no.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.168
We must
Get to the roof.

15:15.169 --> 15:17.143
Come, we'll take
The back stairs.

15:17.144 --> 15:19.520
Make sure the exits
Stay sealed.

15:19.521 --> 15:21.161
Yes, your highness.

15:26.350 --> 15:29.396
One of these doors
Should lead to the roof,

15:29.397 --> 15:30.869
But which one ?

15:30.870 --> 15:36.526
Maybe it's this one.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.142
Boo ! Got you !

15:40.143 --> 15:42.887
You may not be the princess,
But you look enough like her

15:42.888 --> 15:45.264
To ensure our safe getaway--

15:45.265 --> 15:47.741
If you keep that
Pretty little mouth shut.

15:47.742 --> 15:49.783
Not a chance,
Shredder.

15:49.784 --> 15:51.022
As you wish.

15:51.023 --> 15:53.633
I sure hope
That's clean.

15:54.638 --> 15:56.445
Are we...are we
Almost there ?

15:56.446 --> 15:59.458
Yes.
Just a few more steps.

16:02.238 --> 16:03.475
Mallory !

16:06.422 --> 16:07.961
You fiends !

16:07.962 --> 16:12.547
Nevertheless,
A deal is a deal.

16:12.548 --> 16:14.690
Rock steady,
Get the lidium 90.

16:14.691 --> 16:16.297
Right, boss.

16:16.298 --> 16:18.807
You have
What you want.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.481
Now release
My daughter.

16:20.482 --> 16:23.226
Only after i get
Where i'm going.

16:23.227 --> 16:25.235
And don't try
To follow us.

16:25.236 --> 16:27.913
you pulled
It off, boss.

16:30.359 --> 16:33.068
Stop that chopper !

16:33.069 --> 16:34.541
The turtles !

16:34.542 --> 16:37.186
Oh, no, you don't,
Shredder !

16:37.187 --> 16:40.166
Oh, yes, i do,
You bothersome turtles.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.543
This time i won't lose.

16:46.025 --> 16:47.832
Remember, kids,
We're professionals.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.606
Don't try this
At home.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.326
Oh, my poor daughter.

16:54.327 --> 16:56.703
What will become
Of her ?

16:56.704 --> 16:57.908
Father !

16:57.909 --> 17:00.319
Mallory, you're safe !
But who's--

17:00.320 --> 17:02.562
It's a long story.

17:05.342 --> 17:08.923
Whoa, i think
I'm losing my grip, guys !

17:08.924 --> 17:11.266
We've known that
For a long time.

17:11.267 --> 17:14.547
I can't hold on
Much longer !

17:14.548 --> 17:16.656
You won't have to.
Look.

17:16.656 --> 17:18.029
The turtle blimp !

17:18.030 --> 17:19.635
Yeah.
I stashed it there.

17:19.636 --> 17:21.410
I thought it might
Come in handy.

17:21.411 --> 17:23.987
Great ! Let's go !

17:23.988 --> 17:25.828
Banzai !

17:27.771 --> 17:30.147
Fire up the turtle blimp,
Donatello.

17:30.148 --> 17:32.222
We've got to get
April back.

17:32.223 --> 17:35.068
Come in, krang.
Are you there ?

17:35.069 --> 17:38.416
Where else would i be,
Out nightclubbing ?

17:38.417 --> 17:42.165
I'm 10 miles beneath
The surface of the earth !

17:42.166 --> 17:44.073
Shredder: i have
The lidium 90.

17:44.074 --> 17:46.852
Send a module alongside
The art museum.

17:46.853 --> 17:51.003
Ha ha ! For once
You've done something right.

17:51.004 --> 17:54.986
Ho ho ! Nothing
Can stop me now !

17:54.987 --> 17:57.364
Leonardo: stop
Right there, shredder !

17:57.365 --> 17:59.105
You're too late,
Turtles.

18:03.592 --> 18:05.499
Which way
Did they go ?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.670
This way.

18:06.671 --> 18:07.775
After 'em, fellas !

18:10.387 --> 18:13.366
Cowabunga !

18:14.539 --> 18:16.880
Oh, can we stop
And blast them, boss ?

18:16.881 --> 18:18.220
Huh ? Can we ? Can we ?

18:18.221 --> 18:20.998
Yeah. They're
Like sitting ducks.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.304
There's no time.

18:22.305 --> 18:24.179
The module is
On its way.

18:25.552 --> 18:27.594
Donatello,
What's happening ?

18:27.595 --> 18:29.033
Beats me.

18:32.482 --> 18:34.524
Krang, what--
What happened ?

18:34.525 --> 18:36.230
Where's the module ?

18:36.231 --> 18:38.574
It's inside
The museum.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.147
Inside the museum ?

18:40.148 --> 18:43.696
You fool ! You fouled up
The triangulation.

18:43.697 --> 18:45.269
So sue me.

18:45.270 --> 18:47.110
Into the museum !
Hurry !

18:47.111 --> 18:49.219
They're
Going inside.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.458
So are we.

18:54.811 --> 18:57.555
Now, where's
That blasted module ?

18:59.163 --> 19:01.673
Something tells me
It's there.

19:01.674 --> 19:05.255
Hey, dudes,
Sculpt this out.

19:05.256 --> 19:07.464
Yeah, i may not
Know about art,

19:07.465 --> 19:08.770
But i know what i like.

19:10.713 --> 19:13.222
Turtles, help !

19:13.223 --> 19:14.729
April: help !
Over here !

19:14.730 --> 19:17.239
It's april !
This way !

19:17.240 --> 19:19.315
Like, how are we
Going to find her ?

19:19.316 --> 19:22.027
Yeah, there are so many
Rooms in this place.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.872
Well, looks like
We're in luck.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.948
Donatello: and shredder's
Has just run out.

19:26.949 --> 19:30.229
Oh, no ! It's those
Wretched amphibians again.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.874
Now can we
Blast them, boss ?

19:32.875 --> 19:35.719
Blast away,
My moronic mutants !

19:35.720 --> 19:36.924
Stop !

19:36.925 --> 19:39.502
I am placing you
Under house arrest.

19:39.503 --> 19:42.347
Much as i hate to disobey
A royal command...

19:45.194 --> 19:47.101
We've got
To stop them.

19:48.977 --> 19:50.482
It's no use.

19:50.483 --> 19:51.989
It won't budge.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.662
Aah, watch out !

19:58.417 --> 19:59.856
What was that ?

19:59.857 --> 20:03.103
Krang must've flooded
The tube with lava.

20:03.104 --> 20:06.016
It looks like shredder
Beat us this time.

20:06.017 --> 20:07.020
No, he didn't.

20:07.021 --> 20:09.029
The lidium 90 sample
Is worthless.

20:09.030 --> 20:10.401
Worthless ?

20:10.402 --> 20:12.711
Lidium 90
Is highly unstable.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.217
Subjecting it to pressures

20:14.218 --> 20:16.761
Like those found
10 miles beneath the earth

20:16.762 --> 20:18.737
Will cause it
To disintegrate,

20:18.738 --> 20:20.410
Maybe even explode.

20:20.411 --> 20:21.582
Explode ?

20:21.583 --> 20:23.223
Awesome concept.

20:23.224 --> 20:24.730
How about that ?

20:24.731 --> 20:27.809
Old tin grin got faked out.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.550
By the way, congratulations.

20:29.551 --> 20:32.562
Your turtle costumes won first prize.

20:32.563 --> 20:34.739
Yeah, I guess they are
kind of original.

20:34.740 --> 20:36.747
Oh, no, not for originality,

20:36.748 --> 20:38.355
for ridiculousness.

20:45.251 --> 20:48.364
Here, Krang, the lidium 90.

20:48.365 --> 20:50.875
Give it here.
Give it ! Give it !

20:50.876 --> 20:53.184
What's going on here ?

20:53.185 --> 20:54.491
'T know, Give it here.
Give it ! Give it !

20:54.492 --> 20:56.934
But i'm not waiting to find out.

21:05.171 --> 21:07.613
Shredder, you idiot !

21:07.614 --> 21:10.760
I could have been blown to bits !

21:10.761 --> 21:13.806
So sue me.

21:13.807 --> 21:16.284
And that's how it all happened, sensei.

21:16.285 --> 21:18.560
You have done well, my turtles.

21:18.561 --> 21:20.401
Thank you, master Splinter.

21:20.402 --> 21:21.506
As for you, April,

21:21.507 --> 21:23.649
I hope this has taught you a lesson.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.356
It certainly has.

21:25.357 --> 21:27.365
I learned that a disguise

21:27.366 --> 21:29.206
is a great way to get a story.

21:29.207 --> 21:31.047
There's a convention
of bald-headed diplomats

21:31.048 --> 21:32.219
in town next week.

21:32.220 --> 21:35.265
Maybe I could pass as one of them.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.173
Well, what do you think ?

21:37.174 --> 21:38.579
Paint that thing green,

21:38.580 --> 21:40.186
and you can pass as one of us.
