* Well, we're movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:04.367 --> 00:07.233
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:07.267 --> 00:11.567
* To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.600 --> 00:14.633
* Movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:14.667 --> 00:17.800
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:17.833 --> 00:23.433
* We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.467 --> 00:26.067
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.100 --> 00:28.700
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.733 --> 00:31.300
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.333 --> 00:33.900
* Just to get up that hill

00:33.933 --> 00:36.500
* Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
* Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.100 --> 00:41.567
* As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.600 --> 00:43.300
* There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.333 --> 00:46.100

* We finally got
a piece of the pie *

01:10.067 --> 01:13.800
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who's the fairest of them all?

01:13.833 --> 01:15.367
I'll give you a hint.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.833
It ain't Snow White.

01:19.733 --> 01:22.500
Florence? Florence?

01:22.533 --> 01:25.267
Oh, Florence,
you just gotta see
what I picked up today.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.900
Oh, I ain't got time,
Miss Jefferson.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.133
I still have to get dressed.
He'll be here any minute.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.067
Now, calm down.

01:30.067 --> 01:33.400
Sometimes it's fashionable
to keep a gentleman waiting.

01:33.433 --> 01:37.633
Not when you've been
waiting for the gentleman
for 20 years.

01:37.667 --> 01:41.167
This Buzz Thatcher of yours
must really be something.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.167
He sure is, Miss Jefferson.
I tell you, if Buzz was meat,
he'd be steak.

01:46.533 --> 01:49.100
And if he was steak,
he'd be filet mignon.

01:50.567 --> 01:52.333
And if he was filet mignon,
he'd be...

01:52.367 --> 01:53.967
Six-fifty nine a pound.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.500
He sounds delicious, Florence.

01:57.533 --> 01:59.233
Where did you meet him?
At the butcher shop?

01:59.267 --> 02:01.133
No. In church.

02:01.167 --> 02:03.667
When I first laid eyes
on Buzz he was praying.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.867
And that's a good sign.

02:05.900 --> 02:10.300
Well, I like to give
my prayers a little help,
with something like this.

02:11.533 --> 02:14.867
Hey, that's quite
a conversation piece.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.133
I didn't buy it
for conversation.

02:19.567 --> 02:22.800
You know, it's amazing
how a flimsy little thing
like this

02:22.833 --> 02:26.333
can keep a body so warm.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.133
(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:28.167 --> 02:30.267
Oh, hey, I better
check on dinner
before I get dressed.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.167
Uh, you're in a hurry,
I'll do that.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.200
Just take this
into the bedroom.

02:34.233 --> 02:37.167
I don't want George
to check out the merchandise

02:37.200 --> 02:40.067
before he checks out
the merchandise.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.300
Get away from that mirror!
You don't need
no more bad luck.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.067
I know. I already got you.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.833
Weezy?

03:05.100 --> 03:08.333
Oh, hello, George.
How was your day?

03:08.367 --> 03:11.200
-(CHUCKLES)
Good, bad, and ugly.
-What?

03:11.233 --> 03:14.300
Well, business was good,
traffic was bad.
And then there was Florence.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.433
How come the table's set
for four?

03:19.467 --> 03:23.400
I told you this morning,
Florence invited her
new boyfriend over for dinner.

03:23.433 --> 03:27.433
Oh, damn, I forgot about that.
I didn't wanna do
nothing tonight but relax.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.267
Why does she have to
drag him over anyway?

03:29.300 --> 03:32.700
Oh, we're like family to her.
She wants us
to get to know him.

03:32.733 --> 03:35.300
Well, have him send a resume.

03:35.333 --> 03:39.233
When I eat,
I like my turkey on the plate,
not in the chair next to me.

03:42.533 --> 03:44.567
How can you say
something like that, George?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.533
You haven't even met the man.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.067
No, but I have met the woman.

03:48.067 --> 03:50.367
And all Florence's boyfriends
are losers. (CHUCKLES)

03:52.067 --> 03:53.667
Do you think
this color suits me?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.233
Sure. It's loud, ain't it?

03:55.267 --> 03:56.733
(LAUGHING)

03:57.933 --> 04:00.067
Miss Jefferson,
would you zip me up, please?

04:00.100 --> 04:02.700
Florence, you look beautiful.

04:02.733 --> 04:06.300
This dress is gonna
knock your man
right off his feet.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.600
And if it don't,
your cooking will.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.067
What time is this chump
gonna show up anyway?

04:12.067 --> 04:14.067
Any minute.
And don't call him a chump.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.500
He ain't like no man
I ever met, Miss Jefferson.

04:16.533 --> 04:20.867
He's smart, he's kind,
he's sensitive.
And an upstanding Christian.

04:20.900 --> 04:22.933
As a matter of fact,
he goes to church every day.

04:22.967 --> 04:26.100
It figures.
If you were my woman,
I'd be praying a lot, too.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.667
(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:28.700 --> 04:30.167
Oh, that must be Buzz.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.600
Would you open
the door for me,
Mr. Jefferson?

04:31.633 --> 04:33.067
Why can't you open it?

04:33.067 --> 04:35.467
Because I don't want him
to think I'm desperate.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.267
(LAUGHING)

04:37.300 --> 04:39.067
-Now, open the door,
before he leaves!
-(GROANS)

04:42.967 --> 04:45.067
-Guess what.
-Oh, no.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.900
How'd you throw your
back out this time,
Bentley?

04:46.933 --> 04:48.867
I was doing sit-ups.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.600
Sit-ups? What for?

04:50.633 --> 04:52.100
To strengthen my back.

04:53.533 --> 04:55.767
Oh my,
what lovely shoes, Florence.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.733
You should see the rest of me.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.633
Florence, the man is
in enough pain already.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.533
George, will you get off
Florence's back?

05:06.567 --> 05:07.900
And on to mine.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.233
Yeah, and hurry up.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.633
What's Buzz gonna think
if he comes up here

05:10.667 --> 05:12.533
and sees you walking
on Mr. Bentley?

05:12.567 --> 05:14.067
If he's dumb enough
to date you,

05:14.067 --> 05:16.700
I'll charge him a quarter
and tell him this is a ride.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.900
Are you expecting
a date tonight, Florence?

05:20.933 --> 05:23.667
Not just a date. The date.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.100
Florence's dream man
is coming for dinner.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.467
Ah!

05:27.500 --> 05:29.633
-What's the matter?
You met him?
-(LAUGHS) No.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.100
My back just snapped
into place. Thank you.

05:32.133 --> 05:35.067
Good. Now you can snap back
to your own place.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.867
Next time, Mr. Bentley,
maybe you should do
your sit-ups standing up.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.633
Oh, that's good advice,
Mrs. J.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.767
Good luck with your
date tonight, Florence.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.800
Hurry, hurry, Bentley,
you don't wanna be late.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.633
Oh, that's all right, Mr. J.
I'm spending tonight alone.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.467
Oh, well you don't wanna
keep yourself waiting.

05:55.133 --> 05:58.333
-George, don't you think
that was a little rude?
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

05:58.367 --> 06:00.167
No. Watch this time.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.133
Buzz off!

06:03.533 --> 06:05.300
Buzz Thatcher, actually.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.367
-Is Florence home?
-Oh...

06:07.400 --> 06:08.600
Hey, you ain't bad looking.

06:08.633 --> 06:10.767
Oh, I got the wrong apartment.
(LAUGHS)

06:14.400 --> 06:17.333
Oh, no, no, Buzz, come on in.

06:17.367 --> 06:18.633
And don't mind
Mr. Jefferson.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.967
He don't get much practice
giving out compliments.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.733
Oh, hello, Mr. Jefferson.
It's nice to meet you.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.600
Florence talks about you
all the time.

06:25.633 --> 06:27.333
-(LAUGHS)
-She does?

06:27.367 --> 06:29.667
Well, we hope you'll have
dinner with us anyway.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.200
-(LAUGHS)
-Thank you.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.767
Oh, Buzz,
this is Miss Jefferson.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.500
Miss Jefferson, Buzz Thatcher.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.067
-How do you do?
-Hello, Buzz.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.500
-Welcome to our home.
-Thank you very much.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.633
And my, my,

06:41.667 --> 06:44.933
what a lovely home
you've made
for yourselves here.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.533
Thank you, Buzz.
We've been very fortunate.

06:47.567 --> 06:50.067
-Praise the Lord.
-And dirty clothes.
(LAUGHS)

06:53.533 --> 06:55.100
Uh, would you like a drink?

06:55.133 --> 06:57.133
No, no, thank you,
I don't drink.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.700
The Book of Proverbs says

06:58.733 --> 07:00.900
"Look not thou upon the wine
when it is in the cup,

07:00.933 --> 07:04.167
"for at the last
it biteth like a serpent,
and stingeth like an adder."

07:04.200 --> 07:06.567
Sounds like you've been buying
the cheap stuff.

07:09.267 --> 07:10.600
Anybody else?

07:10.633 --> 07:12.900
I'll have what
you're having, George.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.333
I'll just have
a glass of wine.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.433
I guess that couldn't hurt.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.933
Lips that touch wine
will never touch mine.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.100
On second thought,
cancel my order.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.533
What do you do
for a living, Thatcher?

07:26.567 --> 07:28.600
-I work at the post office.
-Oh.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.300
You work in the section
that delays the mail,

07:30.333 --> 07:31.900
or the section that loses it?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.900
Actually, I'm a mailman.

07:34.933 --> 07:38.067
I guess that's why
Florence gave me her
stamp of approval.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.567
-(LAUGHING)
-Yeah.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.100
(LAUGHING)

07:44.867 --> 07:46.167
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:50.833 --> 07:54.067
Well, Mr. Jefferson,
Florence tells me you're
in the cleaning business.

07:54.067 --> 07:56.567
Well, you've certainly chosen
a noble profession.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.667
Cleanliness is next
to godliness.

07:58.700 --> 08:01.467
Oh, well in my case,
cleanliness is next to
Dave's Discount Records.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.333
Which I don't mind,
'cause I get to hear
the BeeGees all day.

08:04.367 --> 08:07.533
* Ah, ah, ah, ah,
staying alive

08:07.567 --> 08:08.900
* Staying alive

08:08.933 --> 08:10.867
* Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying...

08:10.900 --> 08:12.500
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:17.733 --> 08:20.667
Oh, I take it, Buzz,
you're not a BeeGees fan.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.067
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Jefferson.
I don't even know
what a GeeBee is.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.933
It's BeeGee.
I'll put on one
of their records.

08:27.967 --> 08:31.900
No, thank you, Florence.
I, I only listen
to Christian music.

08:31.933 --> 08:35.167
So much of today's music
seems to be the work
of the devil.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.833
(CHUCKLES) Buzz has
such high standards.

08:38.867 --> 08:40.733
What's he doing
hanging around you?

08:42.433 --> 08:44.533
Well, to answer your question,
Mr. Jefferson,

08:44.567 --> 08:48.833
it's simply that I've never
met a woman as charming
and as upright as Florence.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.233
-Hmm.
-Upright?

08:50.267 --> 08:52.233
Every time I see her,
she's lying down.

08:53.767 --> 08:57.267
Listen, buster, you heard him.
He said I'm charming.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.967
Now, Florence,
Mr. Jefferson
is your employer,

09:03.067 --> 09:04.567
and you shouldn't speak
to him that way.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.867
Uh-huh.
You hear that, Florence?

09:06.900 --> 09:08.833
If you say so, Buzz.

09:08.867 --> 09:10.533
Hot damn!

09:10.567 --> 09:12.933
That's the first time
I've seen somebody put
a muzzle on Florence.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.933
You know, there's something
that troubles me about
that word you just used.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.967
-Muzzle?
-No, the four letter one.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.433
-Damn?
-Right.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.800
With all respect,
Mr. Jefferson,

09:23.833 --> 09:25.967
do you have
to use a word like that?

09:26.067 --> 09:27.333
Why? You know a better one?

09:28.933 --> 09:30.500
No, no, you see,
Mr. Jefferson,

09:30.533 --> 09:33.667
words like that show
a lack of reverence.
They're blasphemous.

09:33.700 --> 09:37.367
Well, um,
I could say hot darn,
but I'd be thinking damn.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.967
George, could you come
with me for a minute?

09:41.067 --> 09:42.633
I wanna show you
something in the kitchen.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.367
-Hold it, Weezy,
we're talking.
-Uh, please?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.900
Weezy, what could you possibly
have in the kitchen
so important for me to see?

09:48.933 --> 09:52.433
The corner you're gonna
be sleeping in tonight
if you don't come right away.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.500
Okay, okay. I'll be right back
in a minute, Thatch.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.533
-Weezy, what do you want?
-I want to know
what you think of him.

10:03.567 --> 10:06.100
Thatcher?

10:06.133 --> 10:08.267
Well, I think he's exactly
what Florence was looking for.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.800
I mean, like he's a cross
between Billy Dee Williams
and Billy Graham.

10:13.433 --> 10:14.967
What do you think?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.300
I don't know.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.933
There's something
about him that bothers me.

10:18.967 --> 10:21.500
Weezy, what could
bother you about him?
He don't do nothing wrong.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.200
He don't drink.
He don't swear.

10:23.233 --> 10:25.600
-He don't even
listen to music.
-That's what I mean.

10:25.633 --> 10:27.667
He's not normal.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.200
Well, neither is Florence.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.533
(FLORENCE SCREAMS)

10:32.567 --> 10:34.967
-What was that?
-Sounds like Mini Mouse.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.900
Florence, what is it?

10:37.933 --> 10:41.567
Well, we got some good news
and some bad news.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.500
Florence is not gonna be
working here anymore.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.767
What's the bad news?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.367
That is the bad news.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.467
The good news is,
we're getting married.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.100
Oh, Miss Jefferson!

11:09.933 --> 11:12.667
(WHISTLING)

11:12.700 --> 11:15.800
-Hey, Weezy, I got the cake.
-What kind is it?

11:15.833 --> 11:18.633
Angel food.
(CHUCKLES)
Perfect for Buzz.

11:22.067 --> 11:24.933
Well, I guess I'm ready.

11:24.967 --> 11:28.367
Oh, Florence, you look lovely.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.800
Yeah, you sure do. Hmm.

11:30.833 --> 11:32.600
Coming from you,
that's a compliment.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.500
Coming from you,
that's a miracle.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.933
How do you like
your cake, Florence?

11:37.967 --> 11:39.733
Oh, Miss Jefferson...

11:39.767 --> 11:43.600
"Congratulations Buzz
and Florence."
It's beautiful.

11:43.633 --> 11:45.333
Why don't you
get some plates
to go with it?

11:45.367 --> 11:47.067
George, you get them.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.533
Florence shouldn't be
working at her
own wedding shower.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.133
Oh, yeah, you're right.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.100
Why should today
be different
from any other day.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.700
I got something for you,
Miss Jefferson. Here.

11:59.733 --> 12:02.700
Oh, Florence,
these are your
favorite earrings.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.533
I know.
I wanted you
to have them.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.233
But, I don't understand...

12:06.267 --> 12:08.067
Well, Buzz doesn't
like me
to wear jewelry.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.333
Why not?

12:09.367 --> 12:11.233
He says the body
is the temple of the Lord,

12:11.267 --> 12:14.667
and jewelry ain't got
no place in a temple.

12:14.700 --> 12:19.600
Uh, Florence, are you sure
you're not rushing
into this wedding?

12:19.633 --> 12:23.367
Miss Jefferson,
at my age, I gotta rush.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.233
I wanna get married
while I can still
walk down the aisle.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.700
Well, I'm really gonna
miss you, Florence.

12:31.733 --> 12:33.433
I'm gonna miss you,
too, Miss Jefferson.

12:33.467 --> 12:36.067
-Oh...
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

12:36.067 --> 12:37.467
I'll get it.
That must be her.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.600
-Her who?
-Our new maid.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.067
Were you this excited
when you first heard
I was coming?

12:42.067 --> 12:43.600
-Sure.
-What happened?

12:43.633 --> 12:45.067
You showed up.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.500
Mr. Jefferson,
I'm Betty Clark,
the new maid.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.767
Oh, yeah, come in.
(CHUCKLES)

12:56.067 --> 12:58.500
-Hey, I'll take your coat.
-Oh, thank you.

12:58.533 --> 13:01.133
(CLEARS THROAT)
Uh, this is my wife, Louise.

13:01.167 --> 13:02.300
Hello.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.733
Oh, how do you
do, Mrs. Jefferson?

13:04.767 --> 13:07.867
Oh, she does fine
as long as
she's married to me.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.633
Oh, and this is
Florence Johnston,
the old maid.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.433
He means former maid.

13:16.467 --> 13:17.733
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:17.767 --> 13:20.433
Nice to meet you.
Well, I wanna get
right to work.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.533
Now, that's a maid.

13:22.567 --> 13:24.400
Florence, why don't you
show Betty around?

13:24.433 --> 13:26.800
Okay. What would you
like to see first, Betty?

13:26.833 --> 13:30.267
Well, let's start with
the big things
I'll have to worry about.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.667
Right.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.200
This is his mouth.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.300
Florence.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.200
Now I'll show you
the kitchen.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.233
While you're out there,
you can have
an apple, Betty.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.133
(LAUGHING)

13:49.200 --> 13:50.933
Apple Betty. You get it?

13:50.967 --> 13:53.533
Oh, I'll get it,
Mr. Jefferson,
if you show me where it is.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.200
Never mind.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.867
How can anybody
have such
a bad sense of humor?

14:00.900 --> 14:04.133
I've been asking
myself that for years.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.733
Oh, come on, Weezy,
your sense of humor
ain't that bad.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.567
(DOORBELL RINGS)

14:10.433 --> 14:12.900
Mr. Jefferson, please!

14:15.200 --> 14:16.533
Oh, I forgot, that's your job.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.867
Yes, siree,
Mr. Jefferson.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.533
Oh, hello.
We're here for the shower.

14:23.567 --> 14:26.367
But I haven't had
a chance to clean it yet.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.167
Oh, that's good.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.967
Come in, everybody.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.900
-Hi, Helen.
-Hi, Louise.

14:34.933 --> 14:38.600
-Mr. Bentley.
-Hello, Tom.

14:38.633 --> 14:42.800
-Oh, thank you, Betty.
-Oh, yes, siree,
Mrs. Jefferson.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.267
Uh, Betty, would you bring
the champagne in
from the kitchen, please?

14:45.300 --> 14:47.467
-Oh, yes, siree,
Mr. Jefferson.
-Thank you.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.967
(GROANS)

14:51.300 --> 14:53.333
A pin, Mr. Jefferson.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.933
You could have
gotten stuck.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.067
Mmm-hmm. I think
I've been stuck already.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.400
Oh, Florence,
there you are.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.400
Congratulations.

15:05.433 --> 15:09.100
Yes, we're all
very happy for you.

15:09.133 --> 15:11.700
Well, we're certainly
going to miss you
around here, Florence.

15:11.733 --> 15:13.900
-How long has it been?
-Four years.

15:13.933 --> 15:15.467
Ah, tempus fugit.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.733
Hey, you better watch
your language
when Buzz gets here.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.200
He don't like swearing.

15:21.233 --> 15:23.333
I wonder how it'll feel
to be married.

15:23.367 --> 15:26.300
Oh, don't worry, Florence.
Being married
is no big thing.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.700
Tom!

15:27.733 --> 15:30.067
Uh, what I mean is,
marriage shouldn't
change you. (CHUCKLES)

15:30.067 --> 15:33.567
Although, I remember when
my older sister got married,
she married a sailor.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.667
And they moved away
from home
for a number of years.

15:35.700 --> 15:39.067
Well, when she finally
returned to the house
after all that time,

15:39.100 --> 15:40.567
nobody recognized her.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.067
She changed that much?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.067
Oh, no, we didn't
live there anymore.

15:47.433 --> 15:48.700
(DOORBELL RINGS)

15:48.733 --> 15:50.400
Oh, it's him, everybody!
It's him!

15:50.433 --> 15:53.667
Oh, wait till you see him.
You ain't gonna
believe your eyes!

15:53.700 --> 15:57.100
Well I know you're gonna
like him, 'cause he's kind,
he's gentle, he's considerate.

15:57.133 --> 16:00.067
Florence,
if you don't answer the door,
he's gonna be gone.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.567
Oh, right.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.533
Hello, Buzz.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.767
Hello, Florence.
Praise the Lord.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.967
Right. Come in.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.933
Florence, would you
like to introduce
your fiance?

16:19.967 --> 16:22.367
All right.
Everybody, this is him!

16:24.067 --> 16:27.500
Buzz Thatcher,
meet our neighbors,
Harry Bentley.

16:27.533 --> 16:28.933
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-How do you do?

16:28.967 --> 16:30.600
-And Tom and Helen Willis.
-Hello.
How do you do?

16:30.633 --> 16:33.233
-Oh, it's nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you, too.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.367
-Oh, thank you.
-No, no, no,
Mr. Jefferson.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.333
Take a napkin.
Your furniture would be
hard to replace.

16:38.367 --> 16:40.267
Oh, yeah?
You wouldn't.
(LAUGHS)

16:40.300 --> 16:42.067
Yes, siree,
Mr. Jefferson.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.167
Uh, how about a toast?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.433
-Oh, great idea.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, yes.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.667
Thank you.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.133
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:54.833 --> 16:59.433
Here's a toast my best man
proposed to me and Helen
on our wedding day.

16:59.467 --> 17:02.467
-May the bed
in your hotel room...
-(COUGHS)

17:02.500 --> 17:05.467
Tom, not that one.
It even made you turn red.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.467
That must have been
an improvement.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.433
Man, I get tired
just watching her.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.933
Uh, to Buzz and Florence.

17:24.967 --> 17:27.500
May your voyage
together be
full of happiness.

17:27.533 --> 17:29.133
Here, here.

17:29.167 --> 17:32.200
And may the waters
on your sea of matrimony
be forever tranquil.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.867
-Oh...
-And may the sails...

17:33.900 --> 17:37.567
Hey, Bentley, dock the ship.
My champagne's getting flat.

17:38.967 --> 17:40.367
Cheers.

17:42.933 --> 17:46.433
Oh, Buzz, you and Florence
make such
a handsome couple.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.667
Thank you, Mrs. Willis.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.133
But beauty is only skin deep.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.567
It's not important
in the eyes of the Lord.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.300
-Is it, Florence?
-Um, right.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.700
Florence, why don't you
open your presents now?

17:57.733 --> 17:59.533
-Yes.
-Okay.

17:59.567 --> 18:02.067
Ain't this nice, Buzz?
All these presents?

18:02.067 --> 18:03.767
The Lord has
truly blessed us.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.633
Hmm. I don't think
there's a present there
from Him.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.067
That's from us.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.733
-Oh, thank you,
Mr. and Mrs. Willis.
-Thank you.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.667
I wonder what it is.

18:26.167 --> 18:29.100
-Oh look, Buzz,
our very own Bible.
-Oh.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.567
It's a special edition
from Tom's publishing house.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.067
Oh, thank you
very, very much.

18:34.067 --> 18:36.867
This reminds me
of Psalm 68 verse 12.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.467
"The Lord gave the word,

18:38.500 --> 18:41.100
"and great was the company
of those that published it."

18:41.133 --> 18:44.167
Well, that certainly is, uh,
appropriate.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.067
Oh, you made
a mistake, Buzz.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.833
It's Psalm 68, all right.
But it's verse number 11.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.733
Florence dear, you should know
better than to correct me
in front of others.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.333
But I...

18:54.367 --> 18:57.067
Remember, Florence,
a woman's duty is
to honor her husband.

18:57.667 --> 18:58.867
Pay attention, Weez.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.867
Can't you find
something else to do?

19:02.900 --> 19:04.500
Oh, yes, siree,
Mr. Jefferson.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.967
Yes, siree,
Mr. Jefferson.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.700
-That one's from me.
-Oh, thank you.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.100
Oh, let's see here.

19:15.133 --> 19:16.667
-Oh.
-Oh.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.100
How lovely.

19:18.133 --> 19:20.300
Yes, it's a needlepoint.
I made it myself.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.067
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Bentley.

19:22.067 --> 19:24.067
Yes, an East Indian friend
of mine suggested it.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.400
It's a Hindu design
symbolizing love.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.633
Hindu?

19:28.667 --> 19:31.067
Isn't it a shame that
a culture which
creates such beauty

19:31.067 --> 19:33.967
is so unaware
of the ways of our Lord.

19:34.067 --> 19:37.167
It's unfortunate,
but until these people
can accept the true light,

19:37.200 --> 19:39.900
they're doomed eternally
to the fires of hell.

19:39.933 --> 19:42.233
Oh, my friend
is such a nice fellow, too.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.700
Well, anyway,
it's beautiful,
Mr. Bentley.

19:48.733 --> 19:50.567
And I'm gonna
hang it right up.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.433
I don't know that
we'll have room
for it, Florence.

19:56.267 --> 19:57.633
Uh...

19:57.667 --> 20:00.667
What Buzz means is
that at the moment,

20:00.700 --> 20:03.733
all we can afford is
his little bachelor apartment.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.033
But the Lord will provide.

20:06.067 --> 20:08.833
You know, Buzz,
I was thinking,
maybe I could help provide.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.633
I could get a job
and we could
save up for a house.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.833
No. No, dear.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.467
I don't want
my wife to work.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.833
You're marrying
the right woman.
(LAUGHING)

20:19.933 --> 20:21.833
I just meant until...

20:21.867 --> 20:25.300
Florence, I think you
must have heard me
the first time. I said, no.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.767
If you plan to be
a good wife, dear,
your place is in the home.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.667
And in the home,
there can only be
one master.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.133
Master?

20:33.167 --> 20:35.833
The Good Book says
"The head of the woman
is the man."

20:35.867 --> 20:39.567
Now you are the woman,
and I am the man.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.000
-Yeah, but I...
-Florence,

20:42.033 --> 20:44.333
here, here's our present
from George and me.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.867
-(EXCLAIMS)
Oh, Miss Jefferson...
-Wow.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.567
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:51.600 --> 20:54.933
It's beautiful!
How do you like it, Buzz?

20:54.967 --> 20:57.733
Put it back in the box.

20:57.767 --> 21:00.700
-But don't you like it?
-Put it back in the box.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.333
-But, Buzz, I...
-Put the damn thing
back in the box!

21:09.733 --> 21:12.500
It's okay, Buzz.
We all know you
were thinking "darn".

21:18.667 --> 21:23.433
I'm, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, my friends,
please, for my, my blasphemy.

21:23.467 --> 21:26.267
Uh, if you like,
Florence, you can
exchange it tomorrow.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.567
-I think you
should do that.
-Why?

21:28.600 --> 21:32.067
Because only a sinner
would wear such a thing.

21:32.067 --> 21:33.900
What are you talking about?
Weezy's got one just like it.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.500
So have I.

21:38.700 --> 21:42.300
I mean,
I brought one
for a lady friend.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.233
Uh, uh, Tom,
I'd like a drink of water.

21:44.267 --> 21:45.500
Will you come with me?

21:45.533 --> 21:46.933
Well, I, uh...

21:48.700 --> 21:51.200
Yes, I'm a bit
parched myself.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.467
Uh, Buzz,
I only meant...

21:55.500 --> 21:58.067
I know exactly
what you meant.

21:58.067 --> 22:01.633
You meant to corrupt
my Florence with this,
this garment.

22:01.667 --> 22:02.733
I...

22:02.767 --> 22:04.133
You're a sinful woman!

22:04.167 --> 22:05.800
-Now wait a minute, chump!
-Sit down!

22:07.833 --> 22:10.067
And don't call my man
a chump!

22:10.067 --> 22:11.667
Now look here, chump!

22:13.600 --> 22:15.867
Florence, how dare you
talk to me like that!

22:15.900 --> 22:17.333
I'll talk to you
anyway I want.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.567
But, Florence,
you know that...

22:18.600 --> 22:20.200
And I'll wear
anything I want!

22:20.233 --> 22:22.533
I used to think of you
as my angel.

22:22.567 --> 22:23.967
Some angel.

22:24.067 --> 22:26.167
The moment you called
this sweet woman a sinner,

22:26.200 --> 22:29.067
you lost your wings
and sprouted a tail.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.133
Now, Florence, you...

22:30.167 --> 22:31.867
This woman is a saint!

22:31.900 --> 22:33.067
Look who she married!

22:37.867 --> 22:41.067
This woman has more
Christian charity
in her little finger

22:41.067 --> 22:44.267
than you got in your
whole Bible thumping body.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.233
I guess I was wrong
about you, Florence.

22:46.267 --> 22:48.633
I thought you were
a decent Christian.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.300
In the scriptures,
you'll find the words...

22:50.333 --> 22:51.867
That's your problem, Buzz.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.733
You know all the words.
You just don't know
what they mean!

23:03.067 --> 23:05.100
The engagement is off!

23:05.133 --> 23:06.300
Hot damn!

23:14.400 --> 23:15.833
And I didn't mean "darn".

23:17.500 --> 23:19.300
Florence...
(LAUGHS)

23:20.567 --> 23:23.200
Oh, Florence, I'm sorry.

23:23.233 --> 23:25.300
Oh, ain't no need
to be sorry,
Miss Jefferson.

23:25.333 --> 23:28.333
That dream boat
should have sunk
a long time ago.

23:28.367 --> 23:31.833
I guess the only thing
I was in love with was
the idea of getting married.

23:31.867 --> 23:35.067
Then I say we still have
a reason to celebrate.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.733
-Anybody want a drink?
-Good.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.400
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll go get the napkins.

23:38.433 --> 23:40.833
Hold it, hold it.
Come back here.

23:40.867 --> 23:44.200
Hey, Mr. Jefferson,
I'm only doing what
a maid is supposed to do.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.967
Wrong. I'll show you
what a maid
is supposed to do.

23:47.067 --> 23:48.200
Florence, I need a drink.

23:48.233 --> 23:49.833
Me, too. And make mine
a double.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.200
You see?

23:57.233 --> 23:58.667
I'm sorry, Mr. Jefferson.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.533
I'll finish out the day,

24:00.567 --> 24:04.367
but I'll just have to tell
the agency
I just can't stay here.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.067
-Oh, you're quitting?
-Yes, siree, Mr. Jefferson.

24:07.067 --> 24:10.267
It's crazy to pay
a maid to do nothing.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.367
Hey, Weezy,
she called me crazy.
You believe that?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.733
Yes, siree,
Mr. Jefferson.

24:46.933 --> 24:51.800
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:51.833 --> 24:55.067
* Movin', movin' on up
