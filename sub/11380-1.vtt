01:26.640 --> 01:28.760
-What have you got?
-Parathas.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.360
-Where's the pickle?
-I didn't bring it.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.480
-Why?
-I forgot.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.360
You want me to eat it with plain air?

01:35.440 --> 01:37.000
If you want to.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.400
-Idiot.
-You're an idiot!

01:40.280 --> 01:42.560
-Fool!
-You're a fool!

01:42.640 --> 01:45.200
Eat it if you want,
or dump it in the canal.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.560
You're going to get whacked today.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.080
You'll be walking around with a red butt.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.000
Sattu was looking for you.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.600
He was angry.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.800
He was fuming with anger.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.760
He wants to send you to a
boarding school in London.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.440
As if mom will let him.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.680
"Send me to London!"

02:06.760 --> 02:08.120
Idiotic Sattu.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.240
Why are you staring at me?

02:12.520 --> 02:13.840
Go, get me some water.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.320
Get it yourself.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.840
Get it or else...

02:16.920 --> 02:19.560
-What will you do?
-I'll bite you.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.040
I'll scratch you.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.560
I swear, Sattu. I didn't smoke.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.200
Why are you hitting me?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.200
You don't call your father by his name.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.760
-But grandma calls you Sattu.
-She's my mother.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.680
-But even my mother calls you Sattu.
-Sattu!

02:55.040 --> 02:56.640
Why are you hitting me?

02:57.280 --> 02:58.760
Don't look at me.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.320
Was your teacher lying
when he told me you smoked?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.720
Make up your mind about
why you're hitting me.

03:05.800 --> 03:10.160
For smoking or for calling you Sattu?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.080
Shut up.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.720
He's going abroad, Kaushalya.
And that's final.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.800
He'll die without us.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.360
And if he stays here,
he'll bring us shame.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.240
He's so unmannered.
Calls his dad by his name.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.600
What should I call you?

03:26.680 --> 03:29.240
When I call you "dad"
Kaushalya glares at me.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.920
-Oh, God!
-Shut up.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.440
Pack his bags,
he's leaving tomorrow.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.200
Tomorrow?

03:37.280 --> 03:39.080
Be grateful that I've given
you both one night

03:39.160 --> 03:40.640
to do all your emotional
"give and takes."

03:44.120 --> 03:45.920
-Sattu's gone mad.
-Shut up.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.200
-Sattu!
-Shameless boy!

04:08.760 --> 04:10.640
I'm growing bigger day-by-day.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.480
How big?

04:14.360 --> 04:15.880
Big enough for you.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.560
Mom said I should get married

04:19.640 --> 04:24.600
or someone else will take me away.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.080
Tell her no.

04:28.200 --> 04:33.560
I was going to tell her that I won't
let anybody touch me except Dev.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.320
Paro, I am going insane.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.720
I'm also losing it.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.640
Come back soon.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.960
You're losing it? I've lost it.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.760
Yes, I've lost it too.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.720
You just said you were losing it.

04:55.960 --> 05:00.480
Yes, I was, now I have totally lost it.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.040
Paro.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.080
Tell me.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.800
Paro.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.640
-Send me your photograph.
-You already have one.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.240
A naked one.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.560
Have you gone crazy?

06:23.120 --> 06:26.080
If you ever tell me to do
such a crazy thing again, I'll kill you.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.920
Do you even know how difficult it was?

06:30.760 --> 06:34.080
My heart was pounding like an engine.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.320
I felt like everyone was staring at me.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.160
And that photo shop owner
was staring at me

06:39.240 --> 06:40.560
as if he had never seen them before.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.240
As if his wife applies pimple-removers!
Bloody dog!

06:44.640 --> 06:46.520
Tell me how to use the scanner.
I'll do it myself.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.600
Ma'am, why are you taking
the trouble when I am here?

06:48.720 --> 06:51.640
I'll do such a brilliant job,
it will bring life to the photo.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.520
Don't you get it, fatso?

07:11.880 --> 07:15.000
Paro, I'm coming back.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.400
Eat it. Come on.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.040
Throw it away.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.320
It's Dwij's Haldi Ceremony today.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.560
Paro, you're going to get married next.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.760
Hey, Paro!

11:42.480 --> 11:43.480
What happened?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.760
Dev, how are you?

11:51.920 --> 11:52.920
Manager Uncle.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.240
I am absolutely fine.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.520
Haven't seen you in ages.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.480
Son, what's on your shirt?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.160
I don't know.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.000
It looks like Haldi.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.200
It even smells like Haldi.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.760
-It is Haldi.
-Yes.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.400
Paro?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.080
What are you
searching for on the floor?

12:30.720 --> 12:33.200
Well... my earrings.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.960
-Then what's on your ears?
-On my ears?

12:38.720 --> 12:41.240
Well, earrings.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.280
-Paro, come out.
-Yes.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.520
What's on your hands?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.360
It looks like Haldi.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.320
It even smells like Haldi.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.520
It is Haldi.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.520
Paro, go out.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.040
Welcome, sir. I'm Sunil.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.400
Come along.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.920
This way.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.760
Sir, the sugarcane juice
crystallizes and gets collected here.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.520
And this is where we check
if it has turned into sugar.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.280
Hello, son.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.280
First time?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.400
No?

14:39.800 --> 14:42.080
-You can't put your hands in.
-Why not?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.480
My dress is too tight.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.320
-Can I rip it?
-So that I roam around naked?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.480
-Let go of my hands.
-I won't.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.200
-I am a Punjabi girl.
-I am also a Punjabi boy.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.680
Paro!

15:06.760 --> 15:08.360
-Paro!
-Yes. I'm coming.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.760
-Paro.
-Coming!

15:12.120 --> 15:14.200
-What are you doing there?
-Don't come here.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.560
I'll be right there.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.160
Your father will surely die one day.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.120
What were you doing there?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.880
There's a long queue
outside the toilet.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.320
What?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.520
What if the dogs come inside?

15:46.200 --> 15:49.120
Paro. Paro!

15:50.560 --> 15:51.680
Open the...

15:54.880 --> 15:57.160
There's a long queue
outside the toilet.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.280
-Hey, you.
-Paro.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.160
Do something.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.160
-What do I do?
-Find a solution.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.680
So desperate?

16:16.560 --> 16:17.480
Yes.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.560
That's good.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.680
Paro...

16:29.160 --> 16:30.600
Dev.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.800
I know that you've studied in London.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.480
Even I'm going there.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.880
-Oxford.
-Are you?

16:43.120 --> 16:47.120
Aunt Kaushalya wants us
to get something from the farm.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.360
-Is it?
-Shall we?

16:52.840 --> 16:54.040
Come on.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.599
-Listen.
-What?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.680
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.720
Tell me.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.800
I need the keys to your room.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.000
-Why?
-My Dev is back.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.920
So, why should I give you the keys?

17:46.400 --> 17:47.320
Come on.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.120
I love you.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.720
If you want Dev,
why don't you do it in his room?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.880
Don't you get it?
There are so many people around.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.160
There's a wedding going on.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.360
Have I ever said no to you?

18:01.440 --> 18:02.960
I love you.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.520
First look at yourself! "Loves me."

18:05.720 --> 18:08.320
Be grateful that...
Get lost!

18:08.800 --> 18:10.760
Aunt, you've given the
servants a free hand here.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.360
-Look at him.
-What happened?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.200
What happened?

18:49.680 --> 18:50.840
Look.

19:18.480 --> 19:23.080
Paro is the most
sensuous girl in this village.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.360
You're right.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.080
She can break the bed.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.960
She can bake you to death, man.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.880
Murder you in bed!

19:32.160 --> 19:34.000
-Greetings, sir.
-Sir.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.480
-Where were you?
-I had gone for an outing.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.040
-Alone?
-Yes.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.920
-Brother!
-There she is.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.600
-Dad, when did you arrive?
-Just now.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.520
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.320
-Are you all right?
-Absolutely.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.360
I swear on my dead mother.
She's insatiable.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.760
I was so worn out and sore.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.280
I couldn't get up for two days.
I was hurting.

20:23.160 --> 20:27.080
I am telling you, Sir.
No one can beat Paro.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.360
You're lying.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.880
Curse my dead mother's soul if I'm lying.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.240
She wanted to do
it a while back.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.800
I was so scared I said no.

20:36.040 --> 20:40.040
Why are you glaring
at me like that, sir?

20:40.120 --> 20:43.360
All you have to do is ask
and she'll ride you to eternity.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.440
But I'm very surprised, sir.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.120
You haven't done it
with her yet? I'm shocked.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.840
Hey! What did you do?

21:10.600 --> 21:11.600
What happened?

21:12.880 --> 21:15.320
-Please go out.
-But what happened?

21:16.280 --> 21:17.880
Leave me alone, please.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.560
-What happened?
-Nothing.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.680
London has ruined him.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.480
At least find out what happened.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.120
Let's go out. I'll tell you.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.880
What are you doing?

23:16.960 --> 23:20.200
You asked me to do something.
So, here I am.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.200
Put your hands up.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.200
You're so hairy.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.600
You're such an expert.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.320
How many have you done it with?

23:52.880 --> 23:54.280
Get your hands off!

23:59.880 --> 24:01.200
I said take your hands off!

24:05.240 --> 24:07.200
-Where are you going?
-Let me go.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.800
Tell me what happened.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.400
I said let me go.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.800
You!

24:57.640 --> 24:59.400
There you are.
And why are you carrying that?

24:59.480 --> 25:01.080
Aunt had asked for it.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.080
She was falling
short of mattresses.

25:04.520 --> 25:08.120
Come, dear. Your dad wants to
talk to you. Let's go inside.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.800
Yes, tell me.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.200
-Sit.
-No. Tell me.

25:22.520 --> 25:27.040
Have you met Bhuvan Singh...

25:27.400 --> 25:28.760
who's here for the wedding?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.360
Bhuvan Singh who?

25:30.680 --> 25:33.360
That girl, Rasika's brother.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.800
He likes you.
He wants to marry you.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.800
So what if he likes me?

25:41.360 --> 25:43.440
They're very well-off.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.000
I will only marry Dev.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.960
And will wait for him
till he marries me.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.280
Have you gone crazy?

25:48.560 --> 25:51.440
Why would Satpal
marry his son to you?

25:51.520 --> 25:54.600
Why wouldn't he?
I've made lassi for him all my life.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.280
He loves me so much.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.760
That's okay. But he's my boss.
We're out of his league.

25:59.840 --> 26:04.040
Dev studied in London,
you studied here.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.320
I aced my exams and Dev
barely scraped through his.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.320
At least, try talking to him.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.600
I don't want to embarrass myself.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.720
But you can embarrass
your daughter, right?

26:16.240 --> 26:17.640
Please meet Bhuvan.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.360
Bring him close to me and
I'll chop him into pieces.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.560
Paro!

26:23.200 --> 26:25.040
Paro! Paro!

26:25.120 --> 26:26.480
Listen to me, dear.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.240
Where are you going?

26:32.080 --> 26:33.800
Move aside. Let go.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.080
-Paro.
-Father has gone insane!

26:41.160 --> 26:42.320
He needs treatment.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.480
He's right. Why should
Satpal marry his son to you?

26:46.960 --> 26:50.640
Even Dev has grown up.
Who knows where his heart is.

26:50.720 --> 26:54.080
I know where it is.
He gave it to me when we were kids.

26:55.360 --> 26:59.400
-The bucket is overflowing, my dear.
-I know!

27:02.680 --> 27:05.400
Paro, where are you going?

27:08.680 --> 27:11.840
What kind of a chef is he?
Look what he has done to the rotis.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.040
He has burnt them.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.120
Do your job.
Don't interfere in his.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.520
-Is everything all right?
-Yes.

27:22.680 --> 27:26.960
Finish up, quickly.
We've to sing and dance too. Keep it here.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.440
Paro, come here.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.960
Take this cup of tea to your uncle.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.720
I don't know what is
wrong with this girl.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.360
It's very tasty.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.080
-Please, take it.
-No, that's enough.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.080
Paro, come join us.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.880
-Later.
-Where are you going?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.680
You are Bhuvan's sister, right?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.600
Please don't tell anything to my brother.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.000
Get out.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.480
What were you doing with her?

28:15.320 --> 28:17.240
The same that you do with Sunil.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.800
With Sunil?

28:19.200 --> 28:20.960
What did I do with Sunil?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.320
Tell me.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.560
Is that why you broke his head?

28:33.040 --> 28:36.200
-Go away.
-I didn't do anything with that lousy man.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.840
I know everything.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.360
Sunil told you?

28:46.640 --> 28:48.160
When did he tell you?

28:49.440 --> 28:50.520
Exactly before I broke
the bottle on him.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.760
Leave or else
I'll do the same to you.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.320
You hypocrite!

28:59.720 --> 29:02.200
You broke the bottle on him
after taking Rasika out.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.760
What you do is right.
And if I do it...

29:08.320 --> 29:09.520
I'm leaving.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.520
I came to tell you that
I have received a marriage proposal.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.880
Good.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.120
Go ruin someone else's life.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.760
Anyway, you're not good
enough to get married to me.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.760
A servant's daughter
remains just that, a servant.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.280
Look at yourself.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.960
Unkempt hair,
lousy clothes, ugly as hell.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.000
Illiterate!

29:45.320 --> 29:49.840
My dear

29:50.160 --> 29:54.960
My dear

29:55.200 --> 29:58.320
I don't think I want

29:58.400 --> 30:02.880
This love thing anymore

30:02.960 --> 30:06.640
My dear

30:06.720 --> 30:11.080
I don't think I want

30:11.160 --> 30:17.600
This love thing anymore

30:19.240 --> 30:22.480
My dear

30:24.720 --> 30:28.640
My dear

30:28.720 --> 30:34.120
My dear

30:34.360 --> 30:37.720
My dear

30:37.800 --> 30:41.440
I don't think I want

30:41.520 --> 30:43.960
This love thing anymore

30:44.040 --> 30:46.840
My dear

30:48.400 --> 30:51.200
My dear

31:12.960 --> 31:14.280
-Brother.
-Yes?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.360
Your heartthrob.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.160
You rascal!
What did I do with you?

31:20.240 --> 31:22.200
-Tell me, what did I do with you?
-What are you doing?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.480
Get out of my way.
I'll dump you in the well.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.840
-Have you gone mad?
-You dog!

31:25.920 --> 31:27.240
Come here! What did you tell him?

31:27.320 --> 31:29.200
What did I do?

31:29.280 --> 31:30.160
-What are you--
-You wretch!

31:30.240 --> 31:31.760
-Stop.
-Bloody rascal!

31:31.840 --> 31:35.360
-Where are you running to?
-Run. She has gone insane!

31:35.440 --> 31:36.680
-Paro, what are you doing?
-Stop!

31:36.760 --> 31:38.720
-Run, Sunil!
-Stop. I won't spare you.

31:38.800 --> 31:43.880
Why are you running away?
Stop!

31:44.200 --> 31:45.880
She has gone crazy!

31:48.000 --> 31:49.160
Paro!

31:49.560 --> 31:51.960
Paro, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

31:52.280 --> 31:53.480
Hey, Paro!

31:53.880 --> 31:57.760
-Give the matchbox.
-You'll tear my shirt. Let go.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.840
Give the matchbox!

31:58.920 --> 32:01.400
That's the only other shirt I have!

32:01.480 --> 32:04.600
Paro, please don't burn it.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.480
He burnt my dreams,
I'll burn down his house!

32:07.560 --> 32:08.800
Forgive Sunil.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.160
I could embrace you,
Give you my life always

32:33.240 --> 32:35.640
Shot at my heart
By your double barreled gaze

32:35.720 --> 32:38.640
Shot at my heart

32:41.160 --> 32:43.760
I could embrace you,
Give you my life always

32:43.840 --> 32:46.480
Shot at my heart
By your double barreled gaze

32:46.560 --> 32:49.240
My heart's like a child's
Though you treat it not so mild

32:49.320 --> 32:51.120
I don't know what to do about it now

32:51.200 --> 32:56.280
I should've watched that thing,
Side stepped your beauty sting

32:56.360 --> 33:02.560
I should've watched that thing,
Side stepped your beauty sting

33:13.200 --> 33:15.960
You must be the breeze
That blew from the Chenab

33:16.040 --> 33:18.720
You must be the glory,
The beauty of Punjab

33:18.800 --> 33:21.360
Let's dance

33:21.440 --> 33:24.000
You must be the breeze
That blew from the Chenab

33:24.080 --> 33:27.080
You must be the glory,
The beauty of Punjab

33:29.280 --> 33:32.080
You came into my life
And left me a sweet ruin

33:32.160 --> 33:34.680
Your sweet smile
Will now be my undoing

33:34.760 --> 33:37.360
When you sway that hip
Or pout that precious lip

33:37.440 --> 33:39.440
You unleash another storm,
Sink another ship

33:39.520 --> 33:44.560
I should've watched that thing,
Side stepped your beauty sting

33:44.640 --> 33:50.200
I should've watched that thing,
Side stepped your beauty sting

34:01.680 --> 34:04.200
The way you look, the way you move,
Leaves me in a whirl

34:04.280 --> 34:07.240
I don't know what to do about you

34:09.679 --> 34:12.199
The way you look, the way you move,
Leaves me in a whirl

34:12.280 --> 34:15.320
I don't know what to do about you

34:17.600 --> 34:20.199
You're the heady brew
From the fields that gets us high

34:20.280 --> 34:22.920
You've got every boy in town
Dying to catch your eye

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
You're just like Juliet,
Beauty so renowned

34:25.080 --> 34:26.520
Bhuvan's getting married?

34:33.639 --> 34:35.639
No, no. You won't lose your job.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.159
I am sorry. I had gone crazy.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.040
I am ready to fall at Paro's feet.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.960
You won't do any such thing.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.639
She will be getting married soon.
You got it?

34:45.719 --> 34:48.840
I know she is getting married,
but I might lose my job.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.239
How drunk are you?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.840
Stop ranting about your job!

35:12.040 --> 35:13.840
Paro's looking very beautiful.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.480
Yes.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.880
She's getting married.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.560
-Did she tell you?
-Yes.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.280
I don't know what you're waiting for.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.760
I always had a dream...

35:27.040 --> 35:30.280
of making her your bride

35:30.680 --> 35:32.480
so she would
always remain my daughter.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.760
But London has ruined you.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.680
You prefer vodka over whiskey.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.760
Fish over chicken.

35:40.840 --> 35:44.760
Waif-like stick figures
over a real curvy woman.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.080
You are hopeless.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.600
I'm all tangled up in
This spinning wheel of love

36:09.680 --> 36:13.200
Crumpled with the pain,
From under and above

36:16.640 --> 36:20.120
I'm all tangled up in
This spinning wheel of love

36:20.280 --> 36:23.200
Crumpled with the pain,
From under and above

36:23.280 --> 36:26.800
You spun that wheel, I tottered,
Had a fall

36:26.880 --> 36:30.000
Now I think I'm finished,
I think I've lost my all

36:30.080 --> 36:33.960
I don't think I want
This love thing anymore

36:34.040 --> 36:36.920
God knows why it all happened

36:37.120 --> 36:41.160
I don't think I want
This love thing anymore

36:41.240 --> 36:43.960
God knows why it all happened

36:44.040 --> 36:47.080
I don't think...

36:52.720 --> 36:54.880
Uncle, bless us.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.760
Your eyes intoxicate like opium smoked

37:02.840 --> 37:06.360
You glow and smolder like embers stoked

37:10.080 --> 37:13.280
Your eyes intoxicate like opium smoked

37:13.360 --> 37:16.520
You glow and smolder like embers stoked

37:16.600 --> 37:20.080
What we shared is pieces,
What answers can I give

37:20.160 --> 37:22.760
There's nothing more to say,
No reason left to live

37:53.520 --> 37:54.480
Hello.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.520
-Uncle, where's Dev?
-Dev?

38:01.600 --> 38:02.720
I don't know.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.960
Paro, what are you doing here?
Come, let's dance.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.280
Paro, we have to meet the other guests.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.880
My heart croons

38:26.720 --> 38:27.800
Careful.

38:27.880 --> 38:31.600
One, two, three, four, six

38:31.680 --> 38:34.080
Could I melt this heart into a tune?

38:34.160 --> 38:36.080
Get my heartbeat to croon

38:36.160 --> 38:39.760
Am I smoking hot or what?

38:40.360 --> 38:42.040
In my chest is a fire

38:42.120 --> 38:44.200
My desire's on a pyre

38:44.280 --> 38:47.960
Darling, I don't know what to say

38:48.480 --> 38:50.560
I saw dreams of heaven

38:50.640 --> 38:53.320
But they all went to hell

38:57.080 --> 39:00.960
It's all gone up in smoke
To my world, I bid farewell

39:01.040 --> 39:05.360
God help whoever gets bitten by this bug

39:05.440 --> 39:09.600
The devil takes your beauty,
the devil takes your love

39:09.680 --> 39:14.000
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

39:18.080 --> 39:22.200
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

39:22.280 --> 39:27.000
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

39:28.440 --> 39:31.080
Go away, oh, love

39:32.120 --> 39:34.560
Oh, love

39:34.800 --> 39:38.920
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

39:39.000 --> 39:43.240
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

40:12.400 --> 40:16.440
This heart is torn by a tragedy, tragedy

40:16.520 --> 40:20.720
A paradise lies plundered
Its roses dried and dying

40:20.800 --> 40:25.000
This heart is torn by a tragedy, tragedy

40:25.080 --> 40:29.440
A paradise lies plundered
Its roses dried and dying

40:31.240 --> 40:33.440
Say why did you ditch me?

40:33.520 --> 40:35.520
Now take my life too, kill me

40:35.600 --> 40:38.560
Say why did you ditch me?

40:39.640 --> 40:41.800
Say why did you ditch me?

40:41.880 --> 40:43.880
Now take my life too, kill me

40:43.960 --> 40:46.800
Go away, love

40:48.160 --> 40:52.280
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

40:52.360 --> 40:56.960
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

41:00.640 --> 41:04.920
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

41:05.000 --> 41:09.280
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

41:11.200 --> 41:13.600
Go away, oh, love

41:14.720 --> 41:16.880
Oh, love

41:17.360 --> 41:21.600
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

41:21.680 --> 41:26.000
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

41:30.120 --> 41:34.640
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

41:38.120 --> 41:43.080
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

41:45.920 --> 41:47.000
What happened?

41:47.080 --> 41:50.920
-What happened to him?
-Dev.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.560
Leni.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.000
Baby, wake up.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.480
Leni.

42:58.440 --> 43:05.040
The seasons set on my lashes

43:06.040 --> 43:12.640
I drink the moment,
Each drop splashes

43:13.520 --> 43:20.400
A sun-drop on my forehead falls

43:21.040 --> 43:27.520
To myself I make whispered calls

43:27.600 --> 43:35.000
This is what my life's all about

43:35.200 --> 43:42.640
This is what my life's all about

43:42.720 --> 43:50.360
This is what my life's all about

43:50.440 --> 43:56.640
This is what my life's all about

44:10.480 --> 44:12.160
Leni, you're the best.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.040
Just for my personal use.

44:27.640 --> 44:31.480
Call me later. Love you.

44:31.920 --> 44:32.960
Leni, you're the best.

44:33.040 --> 44:38.480
Green branches

44:38.560 --> 44:42.640
In a blossomed daze

44:44.280 --> 44:51.080
I've splashed color on all my dreams

44:51.160 --> 44:55.680
-Leni, you're the best.
-Leni, you're the best!

45:01.560 --> 45:06.960
-Leni, you're the best.
-The best!

45:07.680 --> 45:11.560
To myself

45:11.640 --> 45:17.800
I make whispered calls

45:19.960 --> 45:23.520
This is what my life's all about

45:23.600 --> 45:27.200
This is what my life's all about

45:27.280 --> 45:32.120
This is what my life's all about

45:34.600 --> 45:35.840
Leni, you're the best.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.840
Leni, you're the best... slut.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.240
Helen...

46:03.440 --> 46:05.840
Taran Yadav, the 28-year-old

46:05.920 --> 46:08.960
who made the objectionable MMS
involving a student of

46:09.040 --> 46:13.640
Mathur International School,
New Delhi has been arrested.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.080
Taran claims the student is his lover.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.760
But according to our sources,
the student is a minor

46:18.840 --> 46:21.680
studying in class twelve
of the same school.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.760
-Go inside.
-Papa

47:08.840 --> 47:09.920
Helen.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.040
-Helen.
-Leni.

47:50.440 --> 47:53.360
-Helen, no.
-Don't do that.

49:25.480 --> 49:31.960
Life plays a cruel game
Of hide and seek

49:32.640 --> 49:39.480
Life plays a cruel game
Of hide and seek

49:39.560 --> 49:43.120
Sometimes near and sometimes far

49:43.200 --> 49:46.600
It makes us laugh

49:46.680 --> 49:52.040
It comes and goes,
This life

50:01.240 --> 50:05.440
Even I've seen it.
But I still want to marry her.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.080
I'll wait.

50:11.240 --> 50:15.400
My mother, she got
married when she was just 15.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.560
Natha Singh. What are you all doing?

50:35.640 --> 50:37.480
You haven't sent the potatoes yet.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.400
These weird
English books are spoiling you.

50:43.920 --> 50:46.200
Why don't you mind
your own business, Grandma?

50:46.360 --> 50:48.400
How dare you answer back!

50:49.040 --> 50:52.960
First, you killed my son,
now you want to kill us all?

50:53.040 --> 50:54.240
What happened?

50:54.320 --> 50:57.720
Look at her staring at me,
like she will kill me as well.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.960
I'm telling you,
let's just bury her in the field.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.200
That's the only way to save our honor.

51:02.280 --> 51:06.040
Look down or I'll gouge your eyes out.

51:06.120 --> 51:09.080
I'll ruin you! Got it?

52:01.040 --> 52:02.320
How much?

52:24.600 --> 52:31.280
Life plays a cruel game
Of hide and seek

52:31.680 --> 52:34.000
Life plays a cruel game...

52:34.080 --> 52:39.040
With a trinket,
With an anklet in my leg

52:39.120 --> 52:42.520
I'll dance with zest

52:42.600 --> 52:46.000
Here swings

52:46.080 --> 52:49.760
Here swings my heart

52:49.840 --> 52:53.120
Here swings

53:00.080 --> 53:06.600
Life plays a cruel game
Of hide and seek

53:07.200 --> 53:14.080
Life plays a cruel game
Of hide and seek

53:14.160 --> 53:17.680
It disappears and then gives us a peek

53:17.760 --> 53:21.280
It makes us laugh

53:21.360 --> 53:25.480
It comes and goes,
This life

53:49.800 --> 53:56.120
Makes us dance, this life

53:56.800 --> 54:02.080
-Makes us cry, this life
-Leni, you're the best.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.960
Makes us cry, this life

54:04.040 --> 54:09.320
Makes us dance, this life

54:09.400 --> 54:11.040
Makes us dance...

54:11.120 --> 54:18.200
Life is like a flower that blossoms

54:18.280 --> 54:24.120
Some are fortunate to be happy
And some to be sad

54:51.080 --> 54:52.680
It's the biggest room here.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.560
It's been vacant for
the last three months.

54:54.840 --> 54:58.680
This room is our way to tell
customers that the girl is numero uno.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.640
And we're in no hurry.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.240
You're still a minor.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.760
You don't have to do
what you don't like...

55:17.760 --> 55:19.240
and till you don't wish to.

55:28.600 --> 55:29.840
Want some?

55:32.720 --> 55:34.720
It makes the bad memories go away.

55:35.800 --> 55:38.760
Stay here. Finish your schooling.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.360
Take your exams.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.120
Join a college,
study what you want to.

55:43.840 --> 55:48.360
A number of girls study here
and also work with us.

55:48.640 --> 55:51.880
And here, everybody has a
fixed time for studies and work.

56:12.680 --> 56:13.960
Look ahead.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.800
It hit me

56:17.280 --> 56:19.480
It hit me

56:21.000 --> 56:22.680
It hit me

56:23.440 --> 56:25.800
It hit me

56:26.680 --> 56:29.120
Did you think of a name?

56:31.200 --> 56:32.160
Chandramukhi.

56:32.240 --> 56:35.360
My anklets tinkle, throw tantrums

56:35.440 --> 56:39.120
Lead me dancing to my lover's drums

56:39.480 --> 56:43.400
Anklets

56:43.480 --> 56:47.120
Lead me dancing to my lover's drums

56:47.360 --> 56:51.680
Anklets

56:51.760 --> 56:55.120
Lead me dancing to my lover's drums

56:56.840 --> 56:57.760
Leni.

56:58.600 --> 56:59.880
Playing hard to get.

57:07.400 --> 57:12.000
Anklets

57:44.280 --> 57:51.320
Clung in hope to my helpless feet

57:51.640 --> 57:52.440
Chanda!

57:52.520 --> 57:57.040
Lost in a daze, with a rhythm crazed,
It calls out to my love

58:04.600 --> 58:07.280
It calls out to my love

58:07.360 --> 58:08.960
You're naked?

58:09.280 --> 58:11.440
Why are you naked?

58:15.480 --> 58:17.520
You were thinking of me?

58:43.760 --> 58:44.720
Chanda!

58:48.240 --> 58:49.560
Careful.

58:51.680 --> 58:52.880
Easy...

59:28.080 --> 59:29.400
Paro.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.720
A scream rose inside

59:38.800 --> 59:40.920
Loud, thick, strong it cried

59:41.000 --> 59:44.600
It sizzled, coursed through every vein

59:45.360 --> 59:47.560
Yesterday stood so tall

59:47.640 --> 59:49.600
Today had a fall

59:49.680 --> 59:53.240
Now to meet my own gaze is a pain

59:54.280 --> 59:58.400
All things I lay eyes on turn to soot

59:58.480 --> 1:00:02.760
My heart is ashes, I crash and burn

1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:07.040
This moment hides a scalded truth

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:10.800
My heart is ashes, I crash and burn

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:15.280
Leave me now, leave me,
Leave me now far from my sight

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:19.240
Leave me now, leave me now

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:24.520
Leave me now, leave me,
Leave me now far from my sight

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:28.400
Leave me now, leave me now

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.280
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:36.640
-The keys?
-Oh, keys.

1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:57.840
He's addicted to white women.
Not easy to give up, is it?

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.880
I know.
He's a rich spoiled brat!

1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:10.280
Understood?

1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:14.640
With vodka.

1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:16.480
-What?
-With vodka.

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:36.280
Can I get one more?

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.560
-Where are you going?
-Ghantaghar.

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:53.400
Will you get some there?

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:54.840
You'll get nothing.

1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:58.000
If you wanna drink you'll
have to drive to the border.

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:08.040
What are you doing?

1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:10.040
Don't go there.
Why are you going there?

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:13.040
Hey. Let go my hand.

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.200
Fine.

1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:17.560
Brother, they'll get you drunk,

1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:21.040
strip you and leave you
naked in the trash.

1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:23.640
Then the garbage van will pick you up.

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:29.440
-Thirsty?
-Yes.

1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:31.880
Come with me.

1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:36.600
Come on.

1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:44.520
-What's your name?
-Dev.

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:48.960
-Chunni.
-Chunni?

1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.880
-What are you doing in Delhi?
-Nothing.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:59.880
Any disease you're suffering from?

1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:02.720
Why?

1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:07.080
Just asking.
Asking questions isn't taxable.

1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:10.560
What's the name of the place?

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:13.840
Good watering holes
don't have names.

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:24.760
-Come in, Sir.
-Come here.

1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:26.760
-You've come after a long time, Sir.
-Where's my table?

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:28.560
Your table's ready, Sir. Over there.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:31.800
Come, sit.

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.720
Relax.

1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:39.200
-Ask him.
-Thumbs up?

1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:41.240
Coke.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.000
With Vodka.

1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:47.480
-Do you play relay?
-Sometimes.

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:50.200
Shall we?

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:56.600
I'll drop you home if you lose.

1:05:56.680 --> 1:06:01.600
Get me a whiskey, vodka,
black rum and white rum.

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:02.600
And gin.

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:07.240
No gin. It causes impotency.

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:44.440
Beautiful stranger

1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:47.600
Beautiful stranger

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:55.880
Feel a luscious fever slowly rise,
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:59.440
Beautiful stranger

1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:02.760
Beautiful stranger

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:10.840
Lord save me from this surprise,
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:16.560
Time did me in and fled

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:24.400
God knows what lies ahead

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:31.880
My mind echoes like an empty well

1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:39.080
Runs this way, that way,
Headless, pell-mell

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:44.280
Beautiful stranger

1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:47.920
Beautiful stranger

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:55.120
A thousand dreams inside these eyes,
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:53.880
Your hair hangs sentinel
Over eyes of stone

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.560
Beautiful stranger

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:02.200
Beautiful stranger

1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:09.720
Feel a luscious fever slowly rise,
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:13.040
Beautiful stranger

1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:16.160
Beautiful stranger

1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:24.439
Lord save me from this surprise,
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.040
Beautiful stranger

1:09:46.319 --> 1:09:49.160
Beautiful stranger

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:51.319
Paro.

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:05.600
This is Delhi, my friend.
Here you enjoy a girl...

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:09.280
relish her, but never keep her.

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:12.000
Otherwise, you'll have
to pay dearly for it.

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:16.240
It can cost you your life.
That's a nice watch.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:24.160
Sattu, I want a car.

1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:26.400
Please tell Manager Uncle.

1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.160
I'm in Delhi. Let's meet.

1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:38.200
Where can we meet?

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:41.000
Where do you want to meet?

1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:44.680
Your brother's back from his honeymoon?

1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:46.280
Yes, long back.

1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:49.080
Should I pick you up
from your place?

1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:50.760
Give me the address.

1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:08.280
A luscious fever slowly rises

1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:15.680
This desire hides no surprises

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:23.400
Your name's dug deep on my heart

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:29.760
Your hair hangs sentinel
Over eyes of stone

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:34.600
Beautiful stranger

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:38.760
Beautiful stranger

1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:41.520
Feel a luscious fever slowly rise

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:45.720
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.520
Beautiful stranger

1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:53.840
Beautiful stranger

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:56.400
Lord save me from this surprise

1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:00.720
I'm your beautiful stranger

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.280
Where are you?

1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:11.960
You could've told me.
I'd have...

1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:17.120
You could've told me,
I'd have brought the car.

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:21.320
Where are we going?

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.400
To my hotel.

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:25.440
What will we do there?

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:11.560
Leave me now, leave me,
Leave me now far from my sight

1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:16.400
Leave me now, leave me now

1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:20.320
Leave me now, leave me,
Leave me now far from my sight

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:25.080
Leave me now, leave me now

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:27.320
The splinters of my wounded pleas

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:29.480
Stab into my memories

1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:32.680
And blood flows out

1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:38.280
Where tears should

1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:55.640
My eyes are now deceit,
Just like your devil love

1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.840
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:04.240
My eyes are now deceit,
Just like your devil love

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:08.720
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:16.080
Yes, sir. Tell me.

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:18.080
Chunni, I need a girl.

1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:20.920
Where did you take me that night?

1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:27.880
Leave your credit card here.

1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:30.040
It's Saturday.

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:31.440
Come.

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:33.760
I've reserved a suite for you.

1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:47.840
Sit. Let me check on her. Relax.

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:19.440
She's already busy with somebody.

1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:23.120
Do you want the regular
ones or someone exclusive?

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:42.760
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1:16:57.800 --> 1:16:58.960
Sit. Why are you standing?

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:09.080
In Tamil?

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:15.080
Okay, I'll talk to you in Tamil now.
I'm putting my hand in your shirt now.

1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:18.680
Is that enough?

1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:21.880
Do you want some more?

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:25.080
Put it down? What are you saying?

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:28.240
You're going very fast.

1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:34.760
We'll have to do it slowly,
only then it will be fun. Yes.

1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:38.680
In French?

1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:43.600
Yes, my sweetheart.

1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:46.400
Don't worry.
I'll be waiting outside.

1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:50.600
She'll take time. Don't you worry at all.
I'll wait outside.

1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:56.360
Oh, yes.

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:03.520
I am wearing black.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.520
I am undressing, slowly.

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:11.360
I have taken off all my clothes.

1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:15.960
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, darling.
Do not stop.

1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:18.920
You're driving me crazy!

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000
I am losing my mind!
Oh, yes!

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.440
I don't know what to do anymore!

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:30.200
Oh, yeah! Yes!

1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.040
Don't stop!
I am! I am coming!

1:18:54.480 --> 1:18:56.800
He took 11 minutes. Yes.

1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:17.800
Last time, you passed
out before we could do anything.

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:24.080
I'm Chanda.

1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:26.600
I'm Dev.

1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:36.520
-Can I get a drink?
-Why?

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:40.400
-I'll bathe in it.
-Shall I bathe you?

1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:45.240
I'll have vodka if you have some.

1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:02.280
The mini-bar charges are extra.

1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:16.920
Why are you so mad?

1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:21.400
I can give you a head all night.

1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:27.080
Make you calm down in
a couple of minutes.

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:46.280
Shall we begin?

1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:49.160
No.

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:51.880
Why not?

1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:56.760
Because I don't like your face.

1:20:57.880 --> 1:21:00.360
-Am I that ugly?
-Uglier.

1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:02.480
Then where's the pretty one?

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:16.960
Do you want some?

1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:36.080
Why are you dressed
like a school girl?

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:39.880
All-American Girl.
Have you watched the series?

1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:41.840
No.

1:21:42.640 --> 1:21:43.960
Would you like to watch it?

1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:51.280
Do you want to watch it?

1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:54.920
Have seen a lot of it in the U.K.

1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:58.520
Is it? Were you in the U.K?

1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:00.200
London.

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:50.160
Don't tell anyone, that I did it.
I don't want a queue outside my suite.

1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:55.880
My God!

1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:58.480
Looks like you got
your money's worth.

1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:00.400
What did you do, Chanda?

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:03.480
Not much, but I was about to and...

1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:08.240
Move!

1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:10.160
-What happened?
-What happened?

1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:14.160
-What happened, Chanda?
-What happened? Tell me.

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:15.800
-He just went inside.
-What happened?

1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:16.720
-Chunni!
-Just a moment.

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.280
Don't bring him back
or I'll fall in love.

1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:21.600
-Chunni!
-I think I'm already falling for him.

1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:23.400
What happened? What?

1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:26.040
Chunni!

1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:30.720
Ticket please.

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.240
Move.

1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:40.920
Ticket please.

1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:52.560
Why do they let drunkards enter the bus?

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.240
Sir, ticket.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.840
You are so young.

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:01.760
You booze, get into fights.

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:03.560
Don't your parents object?

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:05.000
Ticket please.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:10.640
If I had a son like you, I would
have thrashed him black and blue.

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:13.360
I would have knocked
some sense into him.

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:16.520
What are you staring at?

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:18.880
-Haven't you ever seen a woman before?
-Here.

1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:28.560
-Madam, ticket please.
-He just ate it.

1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:30.800
-What?
-He just ate it.

1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:33.960
I got it.

1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:38.200
Go to the showroom and
select the color you like.

1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:42.800
Are you okay?

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:44.960
I'm fine.

1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:49.480
When you get the time,
do come and meet us, son.

1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:51.120
Let me talk to him.

1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:52.840
I'm hanging up.

1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:55.520
He hung up.

1:24:57.400 --> 1:24:59.600
Why didn't you tell him you're sick?

1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:01.920
On top of that, you bought him a new car.

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.800
It's okay. He is young. Let him be.

1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:08.720
You're spoiling him unnecessarily.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:11.680
You spoiled him when he was a kid.
Let me do it now.

1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:16.880
What's wrong with him?

1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:35.240
I want to talk to Paro.

1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:41.120
Dev, it's almost midnight.

1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:42.640
It is important.

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:45.040
-She's asleep, Dev.
-Wake her up.

1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:48.960
Dev, even I need to talk to you...
about Rasika.

1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:53.360
Should I speak to you or your dad?

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:55.600
I'll call later.

1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:29.760
These eyes crave

1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:35.480
These eyes crave horizons unseen

1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:38.120
These eyes crave

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:41.240
These eyes crave

1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:44.000
These eyes crave

1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:50.160
These eyes crave the horizons unseen

1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:56.520
Lost my way,
I've lost my way

1:26:56.600 --> 1:27:02.160
These eyes crave

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:37.760
Dev?

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:41.840
-Dev!
-Yes.

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:43.120
What do you want?

1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:45.800
I want to meet you.

1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:48.080
-Are you in Delhi?
-Yes.

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:49.760
Where are you?

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:22.920
Yes?

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.320
Open the door.

1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:38.480
What happened?

1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:43.280
Were you drinking?

1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:52.920
This place is such a dump.

1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:59.120
When did you last take a shower?

1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:04.680
Paro, I love you.

1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:08.760
You're stinking.

1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:11.720
Go take a shower. Then we'll talk.

1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.480
I made a mistake.

1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:19.720
Go take a shower first. Go.

1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:34.400
Oh, God! What a filthy towel.
I'll ask for a fresh one.

1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:39.880
Don't you have housekeeping?

1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:42.320
Ma'am, he never leaves
his keys at the reception.

1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:44.720
Or he just says "come back later."

1:29:58.360 --> 1:29:59.920
-Take these.
-Yes.

1:30:00.040 --> 1:30:01.920
-And bring a carton.
-Yes.

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:03.920
-And take all the other bottles.
-Alright.

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:08.400
-What's this?
-It's cream.

1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:10.080
Wait. Stay here.

1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:13.680
All the items are here,
including the washing powder.

1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:15.760
-Anything else?
-No.

1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:19.200
Take this.

1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:23.240
The clothes haven't been washed for long.

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:25.680
How can you be so dirty?

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:40.960
Paro.

1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:44.160
Paro.

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:45.920
Yes?

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:57.920
I love you, Paro.

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:01.280
Rasika told me everything.

1:31:01.720 --> 1:31:04.280
-She's lying.
-I know everything.

1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:06.360
I'm happy I got married.

1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:09.800
Or else I would've had to
wait for you all my life.

1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:14.320
-Are you happy?
-Yes.

1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:16.520
Mr. Bhuvan is a really nice man.

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:18.200
Mr. Bhuvan?

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:21.240
Had I married you,
I would have called you Mr. Dev.

1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:23.400
Let them soak for a while.

1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:45.480
-What do you want?
-I told you that I love you.

1:31:46.600 --> 1:31:48.680
What do you want?

1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:54.920
I want to love you.

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:59.720
What do you mean
by "want to love me"?

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:12.000
What now?

1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:15.520
Do what you want to but
I'm not taking my clothes off.

1:32:26.520 --> 1:32:27.880
Paro?

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:21.400
Paro, when are you coming
next to see me?

1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:31.080
Next time you want to talk,
call me in the day.

1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:35.040
Are you really happy?
He has two children.

1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:37.720
They're lovely.
And they love me a lot.

1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.400
You don't love me.
You can't love anyone, except yourself.

1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:45.600
You should either marry this
mirror or the one in the toilet.

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:53.440
Drugs, alcohol isn't good for you.

1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:56.960
They blur the reality
to make it look good.

1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:08.680
I'm leaving. Get over me and
go back home, get a life.

1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:11.760
Why don't you go
home to your old man?

1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:15.680
He's not that old, especially in bed.

1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:20.120
Then what are you doing here?
Go and ride your superman.

1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:22.480
I don't need to ride him.
He does all the work.

1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:27.440
You're mocking me, aren't you?

1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:31.760
No, I'm just showing you
what you really are.

1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:46.760
It's raining now

1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:52.520
It's raining now,
A fevered shower

1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:55.400
It's raining now

1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:58.280
It's raining now

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:04.080
It's raining now
Jabbing my scars

1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:07.720
It's raining now

1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:13.400
The song's a wail

1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:20.400
Its raining now

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:26.800
Lost my way, I've lost my way

1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:34.760
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:39.240
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.560
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:47.920
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.360
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:56.600
The devil takes your
Emotional torture from above

1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:00.960
The devil takes your beauty,
The devil takes your love

1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:03.440
Devil takes your love...

1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:06.200
What's wrong?

1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:11.520
Will you say something?

1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:29.800
Your Romeo is so trashed.

1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:32.680
He threw his wallet at me.

1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:35.360
Don't let him go.

1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:38.800
Keep him with you for 10 to 15 days

1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.280
while I max out his cards.

1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:48.400
I witnessed the
climax to his love story.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:52.000
There was a lot of violence.

1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:57.080
-Give me his wallet.
-Why?

1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:58.440
Give me his wallet.

1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:01.360
Hope you are not falling for him.

1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:04.120
You'll get your money,
give me his wallet.

1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.400
Have you lost it?

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:08.040
Shut up, you pimp.

1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:10.520
His wallet.

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:39.760
Did you sleep well?

1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:43.120
Yes.

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:46.640
You can help yourself to some coffee.

1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.640
-What's your story?
-My story?

1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:06.480
I mean how did you become, you know...

1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:08.560
How I became a whore?

1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:11.280
-No...
-Or escort?

1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:18.240
I've a client who works for an NGO.
Even he has trouble calling me that.

1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:21.520
So he calls me CSW.
Commercial Sex Worker.

1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:24.040
It's all about
political correctness.

1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:28.720
-She's right.
-How's she right?

1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:31.760
-You don't love her.
-I do love her.

1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:33.880
If you really loved her,
you would've been with her.

1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:36.440
First, you made a mistake and
when you realized your mistake

1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:37.960
you should've apologized.

1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:40.200
But your "male ego," got in the way.

1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:42.960
You didn't even ask her
not to get married.

1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:00.280
Ever since I've accepted
what I am, I have been okay.

1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:02.560
You're okay?

1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:04.480
You think I'm not?

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:11.080
Not anymore.

1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:15.040
What do you mean, "okay"?

1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:18.480
Whatever you say. You're the boss.

1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:20.880
Why are you all "happy and glee"?

1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:23.680
What should I do then? Cry?

1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:32.720
I heard that.

1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:38.520
-Why are you justifying her?
-Because she's right.

1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:39.880
About what?

1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:41.960
She's happy, she has moved on.

1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:51.960
Let's kill her and bury her.

1:42:57.960 --> 1:43:01.320
They would stare at me as if I was
some kind of a serial killer.

1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:03.320
No one spoke to me.

1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:06.840
How is it my fault if the
whole world saw me doing it?

1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:09.360
And how did they know it was me?

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.240
They neither showed it on TV...

1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:15.920
nor was my photograph published anywhere.

1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:19.040
They all downloaded it.

1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:20.680
Passed it around and enjoyed.

1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:35.080
Let's go out.

1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:37.960
I've also got to pick up my car.

1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:43.680
My heart desires

1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:47.360
To drown in dreams

1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:55.080
Fill up my arms with sky,
Clouds, streams

1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:58.960
A rhythm holds my breath aloft

1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:03.480
A song that's whispered so soft

1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:07.560
Everything's a sweet haze

1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:13.720
I seem to own the world these days

1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:18.600
I seem to own it

1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:20.400
Come on.

1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:52.280
The bee buzzes between flowers

1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:54.200
Humming songs of summer showers

1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:56.080
Sometimes that way,
Sometimes this way

1:44:56.160 --> 1:44:58.000
The world's a swirl
Of colored bliss

1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:01.520
Drenched is this open sky

1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:05.800
Bathed in its colours

1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:08.960
I hum a tune of happiness

1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:13.600
The breeze blows in little laughs

1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:18.120
Hugs the seasons, kisses each draft...

1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:21.040
Instead of consoling me
like a father should...

1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:27.320
and telling me,
"it's okay, my baby.

1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:29.680
Forget the past.
Forget whatever happened."

1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:35.840
He shot himself.

1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:46.360
-Look at me.
-What?

1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:01.920
It's okay, my baby. Forget the past.
Forget whatever happened.

1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:14.720
Whenever I feel sad, I come here.

1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:21.160
How much?

1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:28.720
Take it. No. Keep the change.

1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:42.960
-Is Paro very beautiful?
-Yes.

1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:46.680
I love her to death.

1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:53.120
Still?

1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:55.480
Forever.

1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:28.080
You can sleep more, if you want to.

1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:31.720
Where are you going?

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:41.720
-Will I see you when I get back?
-Yes.

1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:52.200
-Do you know something?
-What?

1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:14.320
Its stubborn pleas
Ring a restless beat

1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:19.320
My anklets plead for a sight of him

1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:21.720
-Her name is Paro.
-I know.

1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:23.880
He's crazy about her.

1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:26.280
He doesn't care about you.
He just sleeps with you.

1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:30.120
Why are you doing
this to my business?

1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:37.680
Haunting me by night and day

1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:45.680
Lead me dancing to
My lover's drums

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:52.800
Lead me dancing to
My lover's drums

1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:17.720
Sir...

1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:21.160
when a woman becomes
used to something

1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:26.120
she is not worth bringing home.

1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:27.760
What do you mean?

1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:29.880
Do you remember what I had said?

1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.520
This is Delhi. Here you enjoy the girl,
relish her

1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:34.920
but never keep her.

1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:38.760
It can cost you your life.

1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:48.560
Chanda?

1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:50.160
She's out.

1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:52.480
She'll be back after noon.

1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:54.680
It is afternoon.

1:49:56.480 --> 1:49:58.400
-Who are you?
-I spoke to you over phone.

1:49:58.480 --> 1:49:59.920
You asked me for a photo.

1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:08.400
By what time will she be back?

1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:13.840
Do you get protection here?

1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:17.440
By the way, my medical
certificate is quite clear.

1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:29.040
Chanda.

1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:36.120
It's all burnt down to ash

1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:46.520
To dust this life's been dashed

1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:53.920
Where's happiness?

1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:03.240
Where's happiness?

1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:30.720
These sighs are charred,
This breath is smoke

1:51:30.800 --> 1:51:35.080
Charred

1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:39.920
Can't revive a hope that's choked

1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.120
Charred

1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:49.480
The night's a coiled snake

1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:53.760
With its fangs drawn

1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:06.600
Welcome, Sir.
Please have a seat over there.

1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:08.160
I will make your life.

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:11.600
This is for your whore.

1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:16.920
And what is this for?

1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:20.920
Sir, you left your room open?

1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:22.440
Your box.

1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:51.160
Where is happiness?

1:52:55.240 --> 1:53:00.880
Where is happiness?

1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:12.840
Where is happiness?

1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.600
Last night, a black BMW maimed
seven people on Tilak Bridge.

1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:05.560
Everyone died on the spot.

1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:08.480
The BMW was located in the
Paharganj area of Delhi.

1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:11.840
The BMW is registered to
famous businessman of Punjab

1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:13.480
Mr. Satpal Singh.

1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:18.240
What do you remember?

1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:22.480
Sattu.

1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:25.680
Read your statement and sign it.

1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:28.400
We'll discuss everything else on the way.

1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.720
Now, listen to me.

1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:45.760
You need to understand
something very clearly.

1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:50.240
Can we make a stop on the way?
I have some work.

1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:52.560
What work?

1:55:53.200 --> 1:55:55.280
I want to tell my
friend that I am fine.

1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:01.240
He doesn't carry a phone.

1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:06.880
Make it quick.

1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:23.160
Chunni?

1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:26.360
Chunni.

1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:29.720
What are you doing here?

1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:31.800
Don't come here again.
I don't want trouble.

1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:34.640
I just need one gram.
I'll pay you later.

1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:37.240
Wait here.

1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:42.880
Here.

1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:45.040
-Thank you, pal.
-Don't come back again.

1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:47.760
I don't want the money.
Your job is done.

1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:53.080
Now, go away.

1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:58.360
This is your medical report.

1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:04.560
The court can cancel
your bail any time...

1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:07.960
but because of your father's death
there is a lot of sympathy for you.

1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:09.400
The press feels sorry for you

1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:11.080
but that doesn't mean you
take advantage of it.

1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:13.560
You're allowed to leave
the city only for four days...

1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:17.080
and be back after his funeral.

1:57:17.160 --> 1:57:19.000
Thereafter you cannot leave Delhi.

1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:24.520
And yes, you will have to visit
the police station every morning

1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:25.960
to sign the register.

1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:29.280
I've stood as your guarantor in the court.
Do you understand me?

1:58:07.800 --> 1:58:10.320
Listen. Dev's here.

1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:16.280
Mother. Dev.

1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:55.480
Why did you do it? Why?

1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:37.720
You were such a nice kid.

1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:39.720
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:41.360
You have everything.

1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:47.160
I hope he rots in jail.

1:59:56.600 --> 2:00:00.720
Here. Money for the lawyer.

2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:03.480
And for me?

2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:07.000
You can take him.

2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:22.640
You don't love me.
You can't love anybody except yourself.

2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:24.480
Go ruin someone else's life.

2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:27.200
Anyway, you're not good
enough to marry me.

2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:29.240
Are you mocking me?

2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:31.280
I'm showing you what you really are.

2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:43.720
You know what? You are not so bad.
I love you.

2:00:51.800 --> 2:00:53.240
What's your name, sir?

2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:07.320
Then let's do one thing.

2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:10.160
Why don't we skip
Delhi and go on a tour?

2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:15.240
Let's drink in solitude.
I'll pay for everything.

2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:49.480
This world's so round

2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:54.600
What's up, comes down

2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:02.640
Sir, try this out

2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:09.160
-What's this?
-Have it. Trust me.

2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:11.120
You're a fortune now,
Next week you're crap

2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:13.080
Free this minute,
The next you're trapped

2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:14.920
Come watch the show

2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:24.080
This world's so round

2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:31.200
What's up, comes down

2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:57.080
Loopy, loopy, sideways skewed

2:02:57.160 --> 2:02:58.960
Sugary, spicy, both ways messed

2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:01.040
The real is unreal,
The real, fake

2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:04.880
It comes and goes, dip by dip

2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:06.800
Hide and seek, finger on the lip

2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:08.640
Boils, bubbles, hides behind

2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:17.840
This world's so round

2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:22.960
What's up, comes down

2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:29.640
-Stop.
-Alright.

2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:38.080
Are you okay?

2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:40.280
What happened?

2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:44.240
What happened, sir?

2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:49.040
-Have some water.
-We can't go any further.

2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:52.560
Keep this money, pal.

2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:55.920
Take me back to Delhi.

2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000
It tempts, pleases

2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:03.600
Then cheats and teases
Smacks our faces in the mud

2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:05.680
Sings a lullaby

2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.720
Then screams out high

2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:11.480
Grinds our faces in the mud

2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:15.440
No bump, no jolt along the way

2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:19.520
Without warning it all gives way

2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:29.360
You are dropping me to Delhi, aren't you?

2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:31.320
This way, that way,
Hands and feet

2:04:31.400 --> 2:04:33.040
God, help us

2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:36.880
You're a fortune now,
Next, you're crap

2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:38.880
Free this minute,
The next you're trapped

2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:40.880
Come watch the show

2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:42.520
Thank you, Satpal.

2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:46.240
-Sir, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

2:04:46.640 --> 2:04:48.320
I'm sorry. Hello!

2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:02.400
Is Paro very beautiful?

2:05:03.080 --> 2:05:04.440
Yes.

2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:07.600
I love her to death.

2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:11.320
-Still?
-Forever.

2:05:19.320 --> 2:05:23.040
Here's your bill, and yours too.

2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:24.520
-What happened?
-Give me the money.

2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:26.080
It's time to close the bar.

2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:27.480
Can I get another drink?

2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:30.720
-Not anymore. Please, leave.
-Okay.

2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:32.960
200, 300.

2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:38.200
Keep this.

2:05:51.400 --> 2:05:53.400
What happened?
Looking for your wallet?

2:05:57.480 --> 2:05:59.760
-No.
-Someone must've picked your pocket.

2:06:01.440 --> 2:06:03.160
-Check his bag.
-Yes.

2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:13.080
-There's nothing. Look.
-Give it to me.

2:06:16.640 --> 2:06:19.320
-It's expensive.
-Doesn't look like it.

2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:23.000
Show me the jacket.

2:06:24.280 --> 2:06:26.600
-Check it.
-Yes.

2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:30.080
Nothing in this too.

2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:33.600
You can get your
money by selling them.

2:06:33.680 --> 2:06:36.480
No, it still won't cover.

2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:43.800
Throw him out.

2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:46.440
Come on, get up.

2:06:48.520 --> 2:06:50.280
Come on!

2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:57.120
Out! Get lost!

2:06:57.800 --> 2:06:59.480
Don't come here again!

2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:01.720
Come on, let's go.

2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:25.360
Hey. Do you have anything to drink?

2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:32.400
What's your name?

2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:43.440
Okay, I'll call you Dwij.

2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:51.200
Yours or mine?

2:07:54.600 --> 2:07:56.360
Yes, hotel reception.

2:07:58.480 --> 2:07:59.400
Dev?

2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:03.520
-Is Chanda there?
-She left.

2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:45.120
Open it. Take him out.

2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:47.960
You are lucky.

2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:49.720
There's still time, straighten up.

2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:53.120
Or you'll end up like
that guy at Tilak Bridge.

2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:17.320
This faint drumbeat in my heart awakes

2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:19.080
A tremor inside

2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:22.680
The fog-veil parts,
The sun fires up

2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:24.400
A tremor inside

2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:26.200
A tremor inside

2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:29.680
A tremor inside

2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:33.280
A tremor inside

2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:36.800
A tremor inside

2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:41.800
Throbs with life a tremor inside

2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:48.960
As far as the eye can see

2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:53.320
An illusion of the truth maybe

2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:55.080
You must have some picture of hers.

2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:56.680
Where did you meet her?

2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.320
There must be some place she arrived from
when you found her at the station.

2:10:00.080 --> 2:10:02.240
There must be some
place she goes to.

2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:10.800
Hey, I'm going for a smoke.

2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:23.080
Hello, Sir.

2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:28.440
Sir, do you remember me?

2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:35.080
It makes you want to live again

2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:38.480
A tremor inside

2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:42.360
It enlivens death,
The tremor inside

2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:44.040
What are you looking for?

2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:45.680
She'll come.

2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:49.080
Meanwhile, serve these momos.

2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:51.600
Over there.

2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:56.200
A tremor inside

2:10:56.280 --> 2:11:01.160
Throbs with life a tremor inside

2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:08.720
Feel these moments

2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:15.200
Touch these moments

2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:17.840
These moments

2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:21.000
Chanda...

2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:26.200
I never loved Paro.

2:11:32.640 --> 2:11:35.280
I never saw her for who she was.

2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:49.920
When did you leave that place?

2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:53.160
The same day you left me.

2:11:53.440 --> 2:11:54.440
Why?

2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:57.640
You got this for me, right?

2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:07.360
Shall we go?

2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:16.440
Fill yourself with the light sublime

2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:23.800
Light up a torch in your heart
