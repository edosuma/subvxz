01:05.960 --> 01:11.090
Dave's log. It's been 147 days
since the great flood.

01:11.173 --> 01:15.511
And only the animals lucky enough to find
a place on the Ark have survived...

01:16.721 --> 01:18.430
well, apart from the fish.

01:18.555 --> 01:19.723
I mean, if anything, I'd imagine

01:19.848 --> 01:22.142
they're delighted
with the whole situation.

01:22.267 --> 01:23.560
And being amphibious,

01:23.685 --> 01:27.689
you might think us Nestrians would
abandon ship to explore the big blue,

01:28.315 --> 01:30.357
but that's just not in our nature.

01:30.482 --> 01:35.738
Our motto has always been:
Nestrians never neglect no-one in need!

01:36.780 --> 01:40.492
I'm not gonna lie,
it hasn't been easy on the Ark.

01:40.618 --> 01:43.912
147 days with no sign of land,

01:44.037 --> 01:46.664
but as head chef on the Ark,

01:46.789 --> 01:48.791
I'm certainly doing my best to maintain

01:48.917 --> 01:51.377
the truce between the carnivores
and the herbivores.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.922
Believe me, cooking 50,000 meals a day
ain't no picnic.

01:56.215 --> 01:59.426
Well, hey, at least eating my food

01:59.551 --> 02:02.221
takes their minds off
eating each other, right?

02:07.642 --> 02:10.520
Yes, yes, we've had
a few challenges along the way...

02:14.607 --> 02:18.860
...but today, the spirits and hopes
of us animals are high.

02:20.779 --> 02:23.448
The strongest and bravest of the doves

02:23.573 --> 02:27.077
shall be sent out in search of land!

02:46.469 --> 02:49.180
Behold, my animal kingdom!

02:50.306 --> 02:55.185
And gaze upon our heroic saviour
and emissary.

02:56.937 --> 02:59.356
On this glorious day,

02:59.481 --> 03:02.192
- we are gathered to wish him well...
- Shh!

03:02.317 --> 03:04.194
...on his perilous journey!

03:08.531 --> 03:10.575
Be safe, my little friend,

03:10.700 --> 03:15.997
and return soon
with news of pastures green.

03:28.717 --> 03:30.551
Lenny!

03:35.973 --> 03:38.225
Ooh.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.937
Timber!

03:58.911 --> 04:00.662
Finny! Leah!

04:00.787 --> 04:02.998
Get back here, now!

04:03.457 --> 04:05.292
We're so gonna get blamed for this!

04:17.595 --> 04:20.430
Hey, guys, what did I miss?

04:39.949 --> 04:43.117
...and then the horse says
to the barman, "Why the short face?"

04:44.452 --> 04:45.870
That's a good one, isn't it?

04:45.995 --> 04:49.958
I've got that crocodile staring at me
again this morning.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.461
Well, can you blame him
with a chef like this?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.297
Enjoy.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.219
Dave, can I have the key
to the food store?

05:02.344 --> 05:04.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you want
the key to the store for?

05:05.055 --> 05:06.305
Are you checking up on me?

05:06.430 --> 05:07.682
No, I was just...

05:07.807 --> 05:10.268
Hazel, you don't trust me? That's it.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.103
You think that I've been
holding out on you.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.438
You think that I've been
hiding the fact from you

05:14.564 --> 05:15.898
and all the other animals

05:16.023 --> 05:17.400
that we've almost run out of food?

05:17.525 --> 05:18.483
Is that what you think?

05:18.608 --> 05:21.152
Well, no. I just wanted an apple, but...

05:21.278 --> 05:23.780
Dave, is there something
you wanna tell me about the food?

05:25.657 --> 05:27.325
Lenny!

05:27.450 --> 05:30.619
And how may I
tickle your taste buds today?

05:30.744 --> 05:31.954
What's this one?

05:32.079 --> 05:33.622
Same as yesterday.

05:33.747 --> 05:35.624
Ugh. And this one?

05:35.749 --> 05:38.169
It's a burnt pot of that one.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.129
Listen here, Nestrian,

05:40.254 --> 05:42.463
when I put you in charge of the food,

05:42.547 --> 05:46.342
I expected a lot more
than this rancid sludge.

05:46.926 --> 05:47.886
The thing is, Lenny...

05:48.011 --> 05:49.679
It's Leonard.

05:49.804 --> 05:51.556
And if the food doesn't improve,

05:51.681 --> 05:55.184
I'm putting Nestrian a l'orange
on the menu.

05:57.936 --> 05:58.979
Enjoy!

06:01.607 --> 06:03.859
The joke's on him.

06:03.984 --> 06:05.735
We ran out of fruit weeks ago.

06:05.860 --> 06:06.819
We what?

06:06.944 --> 06:09.989
Not here. We'll talk later.

06:11.532 --> 06:14.785
We shouldn't be up here,
we're in enough trouble already.

06:14.911 --> 06:19.831
Question. Did our parents tell us
not to build a flying machine?

06:19.956 --> 06:22.876
No... But I think it was implied.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.794
We're in trouble already,

06:24.920 --> 06:27.464
so we might as well have some fun.

06:29.965 --> 06:33.177
We don't jump until I'm ready, okay?

06:33.844 --> 06:35.346
Of course.

06:36.138 --> 06:38.724
- Paw promise?
- That's not a thing.

06:39.642 --> 06:41.519
But it could be. It could be our thing.

06:41.643 --> 06:43.144
Never gonna happen.

06:53.987 --> 06:55.948
What is it now?

06:56.073 --> 06:57.866
What... What if it doesn't work?

06:57.991 --> 06:59.701
I thought you Nestrians
could build anything?

06:59.827 --> 07:03.914
Yeah, but I never built wings before.
I'm just worried that...

07:04.039 --> 07:05.998
Whoa. No worrying.

07:06.123 --> 07:08.084
The last thing we want
is you getting scared

07:08.209 --> 07:10.878
and burping disgusting blue gas
everywhere.

07:11.003 --> 07:14.549
Correction, Nestrians don't
"get scared and burp blue gas".

07:14.632 --> 07:17.343
We emit a malodorous vapor
to ward off foes

07:17.468 --> 07:19.177
when feeling scared!

07:24.599 --> 07:26.560
Whoa! Yeah!

07:26.685 --> 07:28.478
It's working! We're flying!

07:29.396 --> 07:31.063
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

07:35.401 --> 07:36.986
- Huh?
- Sorry!

07:37.111 --> 07:38.863
Please don't tell my dad!

07:38.988 --> 07:41.865
Yeah! Haha, see?

07:41.990 --> 07:43.783
What were you worrying about?

07:45.994 --> 07:49.038
This! This is what I was worrying about!

08:06.721 --> 08:09.223
Bon appÃ©tit!

08:22.110 --> 08:22.986
Mmm.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.404
Pull up, pull up!

08:24.529 --> 08:26.364
- I am pulling!
- Come on! Pull harder!

08:44.714 --> 08:46.633
You both have a lot of growing up to do.

08:46.758 --> 08:48.968
How can we? You treat us like kids.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.720
You are kids!

08:50.845 --> 08:54.640
Then aren't we supposed to have
a lot of growing up to do?

08:54.765 --> 08:56.934
I think they've got us.

08:57.059 --> 09:00.103
This isn't a debate, Dave,
we're their parents!

09:00.229 --> 09:04.149
And as parents,
we're gonna punish you, right?

09:04.817 --> 09:05.983
Absolutely!

09:08.069 --> 09:09.946
- Well? Go on, then.
- Hmm?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.114
Oh, me! Sure. Yeah.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.575
Er... Not a problem.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.245
One punishment coming up.

09:21.373 --> 09:23.375
Erm... Ah...

09:24.501 --> 09:26.044
- Need some help?
- Ba-ba-ba-ba.

09:26.169 --> 09:28.547
I've got this. I've got this.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.422
Now...

09:30.548 --> 09:31.674
No more hang-gliding.

09:31.799 --> 09:32.925
Huh?

09:33.300 --> 09:34.426
Ever again.

09:34.552 --> 09:35.427
- Huh?
- What?

09:35.553 --> 09:37.346
For the rest of the day. Okay?

09:37.471 --> 09:39.849
Good. Now...
let's hug this out.

09:39.974 --> 09:41.433
Oh, for goodness sake.

09:41.558 --> 09:42.934
Until further notice,

09:43.059 --> 09:46.271
you will be spending your days and nights
in the crow's nest,

09:46.396 --> 09:48.773
where you can keep an eye
on the horizon for land

09:48.898 --> 09:50.900
and we can keep an eye on you.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.153
What? That's not fair!

09:53.610 --> 09:55.237
You want to be treated like grown-ups?

09:55.362 --> 09:58.866
Then start acting like grown-ups.
Crow's nest. Now.

10:04.746 --> 10:07.999
Wow, what a view!

10:08.624 --> 10:11.586
This is the best punishment ever!

10:12.086 --> 10:16.299
Ugh! Do you Nestrians
always have to be so upbeat?

10:16.382 --> 10:18.717
Do you Grymps ever stop complaining?

10:18.842 --> 10:22.053
Nope. Speaking of which, I'm hungry.

10:22.179 --> 10:23.847
Let's sneak into the food store.

10:23.972 --> 10:26.725
Uh-uh. Forget it. We're in enough trouble.

10:26.850 --> 10:30.102
Trust me, you don't wanna spend the night
with a hungry Grymp.

10:30.227 --> 10:32.480
Strange things happen.

10:32.605 --> 10:34.940
Wha... What happens?

10:35.065 --> 10:37.276
It's not our fault

10:37.401 --> 10:40.154
we can't control ourselves...

10:43.615 --> 10:46.159
You wanna stick around and find out?

10:53.707 --> 10:54.917
Hurry up!

10:57.294 --> 11:00.756
You really think they'll be fooled
by a couple of straw dummies?

11:00.839 --> 11:02.007
Sure they will.

11:03.217 --> 11:05.760
This is never gonna work.

11:05.885 --> 11:07.887
They don't look anything like us!

11:08.638 --> 11:09.931
Whoa!

11:10.973 --> 11:13.601
I couldn't quite capture
your sulky expression.

11:13.726 --> 11:14.685
Hmm.

11:14.811 --> 11:17.646
If anything, you look mildly disappointed!

11:17.771 --> 11:19.773
They'll do just fine.

11:26.154 --> 11:28.240
Leah, what if we get caught?

11:28.365 --> 11:29.573
We won't get caught.

11:30.241 --> 11:31.951
Because your mom said that we...

11:32.076 --> 11:34.328
My mom said we should act like grown-ups.

11:34.453 --> 11:36.789
And grown-ups do whatever they want.

11:36.914 --> 11:40.000
Which is exactly what we're doing, right?

11:40.125 --> 11:42.710
Wow. You are scary good at arguments.

11:45.547 --> 11:47.507
Hide!

11:47.632 --> 11:49.801
So, what's so important?

11:53.637 --> 11:56.098
Erm... I... Well, erm...

11:56.223 --> 11:57.349
Hmm?

11:58.225 --> 12:00.853
This is all the food we have left?

12:00.978 --> 12:03.856
- Uh-huh.
- Why didn't you say something?

12:04.314 --> 12:07.150
What, to the 50,000 animals lost at sea?

12:07.275 --> 12:08.317
What would I say?

12:08.442 --> 12:12.113
"If you think you're having fun now,
just wait till the food runs out!"

12:13.281 --> 12:14.782
How long will it last?

12:14.907 --> 12:17.450
About five days.

12:17.576 --> 12:20.036
Six if we ask everyone to skip dessert.

12:20.162 --> 12:21.454
Which they won't.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.290
Please tell me you have a plan.

12:23.415 --> 12:27.085
Well, hopefully the Dove will find land
before we all starve to death.

12:27.210 --> 12:28.170
Huh?

12:28.295 --> 12:29.378
In the meantime,

12:29.503 --> 12:32.214
I need to make this food
go a long, long way.

12:32.298 --> 12:33.340
But don't worry, Hazel.

12:33.466 --> 12:37.386
Us Nestrians are famous
for our problem-solving skills.

12:40.681 --> 12:41.848
Thank you!

12:46.603 --> 12:48.396
What's that noise?

13:10.625 --> 13:12.251
Hang on!

13:12.376 --> 13:14.253
I'd already thought of that!

13:20.717 --> 13:24.221
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no!

13:24.846 --> 13:27.682
Crummy craftsmanship!

13:50.328 --> 13:51.871
- Finny, look!
- Huh?

13:52.413 --> 13:54.206
- Come back here!
- Stop!

13:54.331 --> 13:56.083
- Wait for us!
- We're over here!

13:56.208 --> 13:57.543
No!

13:57.668 --> 13:59.169
Ah... Huh?

13:59.294 --> 14:01.088
- Don't leave us!
- Nah.

14:05.092 --> 14:07.969
Well, you made the food
go a long way, all right.

14:08.719 --> 14:10.888
All the way to the bottom of the ocean.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.560
Huh?

14:16.310 --> 14:19.479
"All the way to the bottom of the ocean."

14:19.604 --> 14:21.273
I get it.

14:21.398 --> 14:22.357
Oh, good one.

14:23.525 --> 14:27.821
I needed that. Laughter is so important.

14:31.073 --> 14:32.783
Hmm.

14:34.702 --> 14:37.246
What are we going to do?

14:37.788 --> 14:40.833
We stick to the plan
and say nothing to anybody.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.876
Especially the kids.

14:43.001 --> 14:45.462
The last thing we want is them worrying.

14:49.716 --> 14:50.884
Wait!

14:52.343 --> 14:53.635
Wait for us!

14:54.428 --> 14:56.555
This can't be happening!

14:57.097 --> 15:01.310
Oh, no! Wait!

15:01.435 --> 15:04.521
It's no use, Finny, they're gone.

15:13.279 --> 15:17.074
As soon as they see we're missing,
they'll come back for us.

15:17.199 --> 15:18.867
Totally. I'm not worried.

15:18.992 --> 15:21.411
Me neither.

15:32.213 --> 15:34.632
Well, that's Leah and Finny fed.

15:34.965 --> 15:38.427
Only 49,998 animals to go.

15:38.552 --> 15:41.638
Any ideas on where exactly
you're gonna pull their food out of?

15:41.763 --> 15:44.015
I told you, I'm working on it.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.810
And, hey,
the kids could spot land any minute.

15:46.935 --> 15:49.604
They're certainly taking
their look-out duties seriously.

15:49.729 --> 15:51.689
Haven't moved all morning.

15:52.148 --> 15:56.068
See? All kids need is a little discipline
to keep out of trouble.

15:56.610 --> 15:57.569
Ah.

16:01.115 --> 16:03.867
I don't think they're coming back.

16:03.992 --> 16:08.162
They will. And until then,
we'll just have to make the most of it.

16:09.205 --> 16:11.833
The most of what? There is no "it"!

16:11.958 --> 16:16.003
There's just bloodthirsty sharks
and miles and miles of nothing!

16:17.587 --> 16:19.756
Okay, what are you doing?

16:20.257 --> 16:22.175
Making a hook.

16:22.926 --> 16:24.094
What for?

16:24.928 --> 16:26.221
For this!

16:27.097 --> 16:29.348
- That's incredible!
- It was easy, really.

16:29.473 --> 16:32.560
I just took a little wood from our raft
to make the rod

16:32.685 --> 16:35.187
and then plucked a few of my hairs
to make the line.

16:38.190 --> 16:41.276
I can brush that right out.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.821
All right, let's go fishing!

16:44.946 --> 16:48.199
Ã‰ zuppa del giorno, va bene?

16:50.118 --> 16:53.036
We're nearly out.
And just look at that line!

16:53.162 --> 16:55.122
Oh, I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse!

16:55.247 --> 16:56.039
Relax.

16:56.165 --> 16:59.126
All we have to do is convince
the animals to eat less.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.836
How are you gonna do that?

17:01.253 --> 17:03.922
Watch and learn, Hazel,
watch and learn.

17:04.047 --> 17:05.006
- Next!
- Ugh.

17:09.301 --> 17:10.760
There's a hair in this.

17:10.887 --> 17:12.637
Really? Where?

17:12.762 --> 17:16.476
Right there. And it's purple.
Just like yours.

17:16.601 --> 17:18.351
Pfft! Impossible!

17:18.477 --> 17:20.896
I think I'd know if I were missing a hair.

17:21.396 --> 17:23.482
Oh! Then again,

17:23.607 --> 17:26.358
I can't see my butt from here.

17:26.859 --> 17:28.487
Huh?

17:29.445 --> 17:31.322
I can keep this up all week.

17:31.447 --> 17:34.366
We'll be lucky if the rest lasts
until the end of the day.

17:34.492 --> 17:36.368
Well, let's stay positive.

17:36.494 --> 17:39.830
Hey, for all we know,
the Dove's already found land!

18:01.600 --> 18:03.519
Leah, Leah, Leah.

18:03.644 --> 18:04.812
Fishing is an art.

18:04.937 --> 18:08.397
You can't just drop a hook in the water
and hope for the best.

18:08.523 --> 18:11.025
Huh? I've got something!

18:11.150 --> 18:13.820
Really? I never caught anything
in my life!

18:22.369 --> 18:25.539
I'm sorry! I have tentlecles.

18:25.664 --> 18:29.416
Tentcycles. Tent... I'm a bit electricky.

18:31.752 --> 18:33.921
- What is that, and can we eat it?
- What?

18:34.046 --> 18:35.297
Hi! I'm Jelly.

18:35.422 --> 18:39.051
Hey! She's a jellyfish,
and I'm pretty sure you can't eat them.

18:39.176 --> 18:42.345
Oh, you can totally eat jellyfish.

18:42.470 --> 18:47.350
Turtles eat us, sharks eat us,
and even other jellyfish eat us.

18:47.475 --> 18:51.688
And I don't wanna sound big-headed,
but I hear that we're delicious.

18:52.439 --> 18:53.730
Huh?

18:53.856 --> 18:56.608
No, you can't eat her!

18:56.733 --> 18:59.194
Ugh. Fine. Throw her overboard.

18:59.611 --> 19:01.447
Can't I stay with you guys?

19:01.572 --> 19:02.865
- Yes!
- No!

19:03.365 --> 19:05.867
Please! I got lost in the flood.

19:05.992 --> 19:08.953
We got lost too!
Isn't that right, Leah?

19:09.078 --> 19:11.247
No. She's not staying.

19:11.372 --> 19:14.375
Anyway, she needs to be in the water,
right? Hmm?

19:14.500 --> 19:18.587
Exactly, here you are,
some nice cool water.

19:20.255 --> 19:21.465
Don't worry,

19:21.590 --> 19:24.926
we'd never throw you back
into the shark-infested water.

19:25.802 --> 19:26.928
Would we?

19:43.568 --> 19:46.070
Er, hold on. Where is everyone?

19:49.073 --> 19:52.535
I want everyone back in their cabins.

19:55.162 --> 19:56.955
There's a...

19:57.080 --> 19:58.499
storm coming.

20:04.254 --> 20:07.131
I don't feel very well.

20:07.256 --> 20:11.719
- Neither do I.
- In fact, I feel terrible.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.471
This is great!

20:13.596 --> 20:14.597
Huh?

20:14.722 --> 20:17.891
If everybody's seasick, nobody's eating!

20:21.603 --> 20:22.687
The kids!

20:33.531 --> 20:37.409
Hold on, everything is going to be okay!

20:37.535 --> 20:40.829
I repeat, everything is going to be o...

20:51.923 --> 20:53.132
Finny!

20:56.260 --> 20:58.095
Oh, no! No!

20:58.679 --> 20:59.763
Huh?

21:00.347 --> 21:01.306
They're dummies!

21:01.432 --> 21:03.183
No, Hazel, we're the dummies.

21:03.308 --> 21:06.185
We should never have put them
up there!

21:06.310 --> 21:09.564
No, dummy, these are dummies!

21:10.314 --> 21:12.108
They're dummies?

21:20.615 --> 21:21.741
Dave?

21:23.201 --> 21:24.161
Mm?

21:24.286 --> 21:25.203
Where are the kids?

21:25.787 --> 21:26.788
Ah.

21:34.420 --> 21:35.546
Finny!

21:35.671 --> 21:37.631
Help her, Finny, help her!

22:04.947 --> 22:07.033
Leah!

22:08.159 --> 22:09.786
Jelly!

22:15.166 --> 22:16.250
Huh?

22:16.584 --> 22:17.876
Huh? Hmm?

22:20.212 --> 22:21.296
Leah?

22:56.912 --> 22:58.330
Hmm. Huh?

23:10.049 --> 23:11.300
Hey!

23:11.426 --> 23:12.844
Wait!

23:25.355 --> 23:26.440
Huh?

23:27.065 --> 23:29.316
- Anybody know this kid?
- I've never seen him before.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.860
Do you think that rumour

23:30.985 --> 23:32.153
about an Ark could be true?

23:32.278 --> 23:34.238
Poor kid,
probably trying to escape.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.707
Land?

23:46.291 --> 23:47.625
La... Land?

23:50.545 --> 23:51.588
Land!

24:00.304 --> 24:01.513
Finny?

24:02.598 --> 24:03.891
Jelly?

24:04.599 --> 24:05.558
Huh?

24:10.354 --> 24:11.689
Jelly?

24:14.984 --> 24:16.402
Oh, no...

24:16.527 --> 24:17.486
What's up, Leah?

24:18.278 --> 24:19.446
You're alive!

24:20.781 --> 24:21.823
Where's Finny?

24:24.326 --> 24:25.786
I don't know.

24:25.911 --> 24:28.080
- Do you think he's okay?
- Er...

24:28.205 --> 24:31.082
Of course he is! He's a Nestrian.

24:31.207 --> 24:34.627
They're great swimmers
and they've got this gross blue gas

24:34.710 --> 24:36.212
that scares off predators.

24:36.337 --> 24:38.589
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

24:38.714 --> 24:40.424
It's disgusting.

24:40.548 --> 24:43.676
And besides,
this is the only island in a flood.

24:44.844 --> 24:46.429
Where else could he be?

24:47.013 --> 24:48.139
Right?

24:59.149 --> 25:00.192
Huh?

25:02.861 --> 25:05.988
Have a seat in the waiting room,
the doctor will see you soon.

25:06.114 --> 25:07.407
Thank you, madam.

25:07.532 --> 25:09.659
Oh, my aching trunk.

25:10.326 --> 25:12.578
Nestrians?

25:12.703 --> 25:15.832
You're awake! Good. How are you feeling?

25:15.957 --> 25:17.999
You're a Nestrian.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.752
Yes, dear. And so are you.

25:20.836 --> 25:23.922
But... I've never seen another Nestrian.

25:24.047 --> 25:25.674
Apart from my dad, I mean.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.218
Please stop poking me, dear.

25:28.343 --> 25:30.136
Now, was your dad not with you?

25:30.261 --> 25:32.221
No, he's still on the Ark!

25:32.346 --> 25:34.265
I was with my friends. They're not here?

25:34.390 --> 25:36.767
No, you were brought in alone.

25:36.892 --> 25:39.645
What? I have to find them!

25:40.312 --> 25:41.521
Good day, ma'am.

25:45.692 --> 25:48.194
It's the creatures from the sea,
they're back!

25:48.319 --> 25:50.363
Oh, the masks! They're creepy, right?

25:50.488 --> 25:53.907
But they do scare off sharks
and most other folks.

25:54.032 --> 25:57.453
- Can't be too careful out there.
- There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.

25:57.578 --> 26:00.414
- Everything all right, nurse?
- Everything's fine.

26:00.539 --> 26:02.249
Clyde will take you to the leader.

26:02.374 --> 26:04.584
She will answer all your questions.

26:04.667 --> 26:08.296
It's "Chief Clyde" or "Chief". Okay?

26:08.421 --> 26:10.840
Never just "Clyde".

26:11.257 --> 26:12.300
Really?

26:12.884 --> 26:16.179
Yes, really, "Bridget".

26:17.596 --> 26:18.555
Hmm.

26:26.688 --> 26:28.939
Ah. Excuse me.

26:30.608 --> 26:34.403
Down here, most of us thought the Ark
was nothing more than a myth.

26:34.528 --> 26:37.448
I've never met a Nestrian
who wasn't from the colony.

26:37.573 --> 26:38.991
What colony?

26:39.116 --> 26:41.034
Ha! What colony?

26:43.244 --> 26:45.538
This colony!

26:48.124 --> 26:52.087
Ah, seriously, guys?
Do you have to move that right now?

26:52.628 --> 26:55.589
Hurry up, this dramatic moment
won't last forever.

26:59.259 --> 27:01.095
This colony!

27:01.929 --> 27:05.056
Oh, wow.

27:05.723 --> 27:08.434
Don't miss the anniversary party tonight.

27:08.559 --> 27:12.355
The Big Trunk band will be playing
all your favourite hits.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.857
Be there or be square.

27:14.982 --> 27:17.067
- Look, Mom, there's a new kid!
- Wow!

27:17.192 --> 27:19.861
I couldn't have
put it better myself.

27:20.612 --> 27:24.616
Guys! This place is incredible.

27:24.741 --> 27:26.827
Fresh muffins, fresh muffins.

27:26.952 --> 27:29.787
Oh! Look at all that food!

27:29.912 --> 27:31.539
Come and get them while they're hot!

27:31.664 --> 27:35.084
Oh, can we get
some candied seagrass, please?

27:35.167 --> 27:37.670
We've got the best seaweed
in all colonies!

27:43.883 --> 27:47.178
- Oh, there he is!
- Let's go and ask him!

27:47.303 --> 27:50.223
- Were you really on the Ark?
- What was it like?

27:50.348 --> 27:52.975
Weren't you scared
living with all those monsters?

27:53.100 --> 27:54.393
Huh? What monsters?

27:54.518 --> 27:56.603
News travels fast around here!

27:56.729 --> 27:58.355
I'm a monster!

27:58.480 --> 27:59.773
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!

28:02.484 --> 28:05.737
- Clear the edge!
- Mind the edge!

28:05.862 --> 28:08.740
- Easy, now!
- Easy, easy, and ha!

28:09.240 --> 28:10.992
- What's that?
- All right!

28:11.117 --> 28:13.202
It's for the big celebration tonight.

28:13.327 --> 28:15.872
We're making this giant Patch and...

28:15.997 --> 28:18.749
No, I don't wanna ruin the surprise.

28:18.874 --> 28:19.791
What's a Patch?

28:19.916 --> 28:22.544
Patch isn't a "what," she's a "who".

28:22.627 --> 28:23.545
Huh?

28:23.670 --> 28:25.213
And 50 years ago today,

28:25.338 --> 28:29.967
she built this colony as a shelter
for all Nestrians.

28:30.593 --> 28:31.802
A shelter from what?

28:32.344 --> 28:34.764
From the outside world, of course!

28:35.931 --> 28:40.227
It's not like us Nestrians didn't try
to make a life out there.

28:41.478 --> 28:45.440
But no matter where we went
or how far we travelled,

28:45.940 --> 28:47.776
we were never safe.

28:48.318 --> 28:52.738
Even when we discovered
our true destiny as sea creatures,

28:53.197 --> 28:55.657
danger was never far away.

28:55.783 --> 28:59.703
And that's why Patch built
this magnificent colony,

28:59.828 --> 29:04.208
a secret haven,
where we would finally be protected

29:04.332 --> 29:06.501
from the outside world.

29:07.043 --> 29:10.963
And tonight, we're celebrating
her amazing achievement.

29:13.132 --> 29:14.342
We're here!

29:26.728 --> 29:27.813
Huh?

29:29.355 --> 29:30.981
- Wow!
- Right!

29:31.649 --> 29:34.735
The ceremonial robes are ready.

29:35.903 --> 29:36.862
How do I look?

29:36.987 --> 29:40.116
Like a mighty, majestic chicken.

29:41.908 --> 29:43.660
Can we lose the seagrass?

29:43.785 --> 29:46.329
Hmm... I guess.

29:48.665 --> 29:50.500
I see our guest has arrived.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.168
Hi.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.795
Come, come, my child, don't be shy.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.464
You're safe now.
You've found your way home.

29:57.589 --> 29:59.466
Thanks. But I can't stay.

29:59.591 --> 30:00.843
I have to find my friends.

30:00.968 --> 30:03.137
There are other Nestrians out there?

30:03.262 --> 30:05.471
We must organise a search party!

30:06.139 --> 30:08.182
No, not Nestrians.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.892
Jelly is a jellyfish,

30:10.017 --> 30:13.020
and Leah, she's my best friend,
is a Grymp.

30:13.146 --> 30:15.606
- Hmm?
- Your best friend is a Grymp?

30:15.732 --> 30:17.274
Oh, boy. Here we go.

30:17.399 --> 30:21.236
After we find Jelly and Leah,
do you think we can find the Ark too?

30:21.361 --> 30:23.447
Didn't you just escape from the Ark?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.658
Escape? No, I fell overboard.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.826
It wasn't really my fault.

30:28.951 --> 30:30.953
I'm hoping I won't be in too much trouble.

30:31.078 --> 30:34.957
Anyway, they won't care once they see
all the food you guys have here!

30:36.500 --> 30:40.462
Young man, I'm afraid we can't help you
find your friends, or the Ark.

30:40.587 --> 30:42.589
What? Why not?

30:44.966 --> 30:46.051
Look at me!

30:46.176 --> 30:51.014
I have creatures, just like your friend
"the Grymp," to thank for this.

30:51.139 --> 30:52.140
I know, but...

30:52.264 --> 30:53.807
Then you'll know I built this colony

30:53.932 --> 30:57.061
to keep Nestrians safe
from those meat-eating beasts.

30:57.186 --> 30:59.271
And now you wanna bring them here?

30:59.396 --> 31:00.856
Things are different now!

31:00.981 --> 31:02.608
- There's a truce on the Ark.
- Hmm?

31:02.733 --> 31:04.442
And the animals have learned
to live together.

31:04.567 --> 31:07.612
No chance. It's my job
to do what's best for the colony.

31:07.737 --> 31:09.947
Fine, I'll find them myself.

31:10.948 --> 31:13.951
I'm sorry, child,
but we have just one rule here.

31:14.077 --> 31:17.079
Stay secret. Stay safe. Stay sweet.

31:17.204 --> 31:20.040
That's three rules.
And you cannot keep me here.

31:20.624 --> 31:22.042
What choice do we have?

31:22.125 --> 31:24.920
We can't risk you
leading those savages to us.

31:25.045 --> 31:27.172
Don't worry, you'll love it here.

31:27.297 --> 31:29.048
It's the safest place on Earth!

31:29.173 --> 31:31.926
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

31:38.849 --> 31:40.059
What was that?

31:41.851 --> 31:42.894
What was that?

31:43.019 --> 31:45.397
You know,
it happens so much these days,

31:45.522 --> 31:47.065
we don't even notice any more.

31:47.190 --> 31:50.819
Just the colony settling after the flood.
You'll get used to it.

31:50.944 --> 31:55.114
Now, if you don't mind,
I must prepare for the celebrations.

31:55.239 --> 31:58.200
Feel free to explore your new home.

31:58.325 --> 32:00.077
Oh, by the way,

32:00.202 --> 32:01.870
there's a party tonight.

32:01.995 --> 32:05.039
That will take your mind off things.

32:06.082 --> 32:07.250
Don't let him out of your sight.

32:07.333 --> 32:10.795
And I want scouts on the lookout
for the Ark and any other intruders.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.004
Yes, ma'am.

32:21.388 --> 32:24.433
It's just so ridiculous...

32:24.558 --> 32:26.977
I mean,
we really need to stand together...

32:27.102 --> 32:29.061
As if the food wasn't bad enough,

32:29.186 --> 32:31.856
now they don't even show up to serve it!

32:31.981 --> 32:34.358
All right, calm down.

32:34.483 --> 32:36.902
There's probably
a perfectly good explanation.

32:37.027 --> 32:39.405
There is. They don't care no more.

32:40.363 --> 32:41.906
And they put...

32:44.325 --> 32:46.786
- Purple butt fuzz in the breakfast?
- Mm-hmm.

32:50.123 --> 32:51.750
Right, that's it.

32:54.585 --> 32:56.837
Okay, okay,
I checked the upper deck,

32:56.962 --> 32:59.673
I checked the lower deck,
I checked the bridge...

32:59.798 --> 33:01.925
I even checked the poop deck.

33:02.051 --> 33:05.136
Phew-hew-hew! Not a pretty sight.

33:05.261 --> 33:07.513
And I can't find them!

33:07.638 --> 33:09.223
Any luck here?

33:09.348 --> 33:12.310
- Those are Leah's claw marks.
- Huh?

33:16.772 --> 33:18.940
They must have fallen overboard
with all the food!

33:19.608 --> 33:21.526
No!

33:30.659 --> 33:31.744
Hi, guys.

33:32.953 --> 33:35.790
Did he just say all the food is gone?

33:36.791 --> 33:39.835
Hey, guys, what did I miss?

33:45.215 --> 33:47.675
Oh... Is it getting hotter?

33:51.304 --> 33:54.264
Oh, it's definitely getting hotter.

33:54.390 --> 33:56.600
And it's making my water hotter.

33:56.725 --> 33:58.352
Can you change my water?

33:58.477 --> 34:00.854
Ugh. Why do I have to change your water?

34:01.313 --> 34:03.649
Because you're the grown-up, right?

34:03.774 --> 34:05.900
Ugh! Fine.

34:10.612 --> 34:14.199
Whoa. Nice! You know what?

34:14.324 --> 34:16.159
I think our luck is changing.

34:16.742 --> 34:17.786
Better?

34:17.911 --> 34:21.540
Much better.

34:22.206 --> 34:24.376
Oh! Hi there! Who are you?

34:25.335 --> 34:26.545
Huh?

34:26.670 --> 34:27.628
Hide!

34:35.553 --> 34:37.304
Ouch.

34:41.891 --> 34:43.726
Don't let her get away!

34:43.851 --> 34:46.271
I'm right behind you.

34:46.396 --> 34:48.565
Come on!

34:48.606 --> 34:51.150
Oh oh.. Right, here we go.

34:52.150 --> 34:53.444
Huh...

35:08.499 --> 35:10.126
Where are you going?

35:13.504 --> 35:14.464
Huh?

35:22.512 --> 35:24.097
It's the Ark!

35:24.514 --> 35:26.058
Hey, did you hear that?

35:29.060 --> 35:30.269
Hello!

35:31.228 --> 35:33.647
Hey! Over here!

35:35.316 --> 35:37.109
I'm over here!

35:43.114 --> 35:45.492
Ow!

35:45.617 --> 35:47.952
Huh?

35:48.078 --> 35:49.788
Ow, my butt!

35:49.913 --> 35:52.373
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! My feet!

35:53.499 --> 35:54.833
Huh?

35:58.462 --> 35:59.922
Lava!

36:16.770 --> 36:17.771
Oh, no.

36:17.896 --> 36:19.481
What is it? Can you see her?

36:19.606 --> 36:21.566
No, but that's the Ark!

36:23.694 --> 36:25.195
Oh, no.

36:25.987 --> 36:28.364
First we get our butts kicked
by the Grymp,

36:28.489 --> 36:30.574
then we lose her, and now this!

36:30.700 --> 36:32.535
What are you going to tell Clyde?

36:32.660 --> 36:34.870
Me? Why do I have to tell him?

36:44.963 --> 36:46.756
Erm, if anyone asks,

36:46.881 --> 36:49.300
this all happened
in a much cooler way, okay?

36:49.426 --> 36:50.885
Yeah!

37:09.777 --> 37:11.863
Don't worry, I got this.

37:12.655 --> 37:14.741
Any final words?

37:14.866 --> 37:15.866
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

37:15.991 --> 37:17.784
See you in smell!

37:23.415 --> 37:24.499
Huh?

37:28.961 --> 37:30.171
Oh.

37:30.296 --> 37:33.758
I'll ask you again. Any final words?

37:36.218 --> 37:39.305
Leave this to me.

37:41.348 --> 37:43.350
Land. Land ahoy!

37:43.475 --> 37:45.810
Nice try.

37:47.145 --> 37:51.274
She's right! Land ahoy! Land ahoy!

37:51.399 --> 37:55.152
We're saved. Set course for the island!

38:04.619 --> 38:07.330
Er... Do you think
the kids might be there?

38:07.455 --> 38:09.624
Let's find out.

38:13.836 --> 38:14.879
Huh?

38:16.421 --> 38:18.757
Hey! What are you doing?

38:18.882 --> 38:21.677
I don't know who or what you guys are,

38:21.802 --> 38:23.595
but you have to let me go!

38:23.720 --> 38:25.639
I don't think so.

38:27.557 --> 38:29.141
Mama Leah!

38:29.266 --> 38:31.102
But my friend needs me!

38:31.227 --> 38:34.397
The volcano...
I have to get her out of there!

38:35.898 --> 38:39.026
A volcano?
Your friend is a volcano?

38:39.151 --> 38:41.945
No. She's a jellyfish.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.988
The jellyfish is a volcano?

38:44.114 --> 38:45.990
No. Nobody's a volcano.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.910
My friend, a jellyfish,
is up there on her own.

38:49.035 --> 38:53.288
Oh, I get it.
The jellyfish's name is Volcano.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.040
Well, I'm glad we cleared that up.

39:13.057 --> 39:14.559
But hang on a second.

39:14.684 --> 39:18.061
If you're friends with a volcano,
you should be careful!

39:18.186 --> 39:20.147
You never know when they're gonna go off.

39:20.272 --> 39:22.858
You could get covered in jelly
or anything!

39:25.902 --> 39:27.487
Whoa!

39:42.000 --> 39:44.169
Here is a little reminder.

39:44.294 --> 39:48.715
Our beloved leader Patch
will be attending the party tonight,

39:48.840 --> 39:50.925
so make sure your fur is well groomed,

39:51.051 --> 39:53.969
- and behave yourselves.
- Finny!

39:54.094 --> 39:55.387
Yay!

40:02.895 --> 40:05.521
Keep coming, keep coming.

40:06.356 --> 40:07.940
Loads of room.

40:13.780 --> 40:15.114
Well done, sir.

40:15.239 --> 40:17.282
Fits like a glove.

40:25.415 --> 40:27.042
Over there!

40:28.876 --> 40:29.919
A raft!

40:31.962 --> 40:34.048
Finny...

40:34.799 --> 40:37.093
Leah? Huh?

40:37.218 --> 40:39.512
- Finny?
- Look at this!

40:42.305 --> 40:44.182
Oh, they're alive!

40:44.307 --> 40:46.601
And they must be somewhere on this island.

41:04.492 --> 41:05.702
Hmm...

41:09.580 --> 41:11.749
Not in the mood for dancing, huh?

41:11.833 --> 41:14.877
If you were told you'd never see
your family or friends again,

41:15.003 --> 41:16.294
would you be dancing?

41:16.420 --> 41:19.089
Clyde!
There's something you need to see.

41:19.214 --> 41:23.635
Chief Clyde. I mean,
how hard is it to call me Chief Clyde?

41:23.760 --> 41:26.430
But you don't understand. This is epic!

41:29.306 --> 41:33.227
Okay. This is epic, Chief Clyde.

41:33.352 --> 41:34.437
Hmm?

41:37.356 --> 41:39.858
Why didn't you say something?

41:44.738 --> 41:45.697
Keep an eye on him.

41:46.114 --> 41:48.575
And you, don't be such a buzzkill.

41:49.284 --> 41:50.952
You must inform Patch at once.

41:51.077 --> 41:54.121
Me?
Why do I always have to tell her!

41:56.790 --> 41:57.833
Hmm.

42:03.838 --> 42:05.048
Psst!

42:05.631 --> 42:06.841
Psst!

42:10.428 --> 42:12.930
Finny! Over here.

42:13.056 --> 42:15.308
Huh? Jelly?

42:19.269 --> 42:21.772
Erm... Is that a pond?

42:22.314 --> 42:23.398
Hmm?

42:24.024 --> 42:27.069
This place is amazing!
It really is a pond!

42:29.111 --> 42:31.447
You're all right! I'm so happy to see you!

42:31.572 --> 42:32.281
Yeah!

42:34.033 --> 42:35.451
Not again!

42:37.828 --> 42:39.205
Where's Leah? Is she okay?

42:39.330 --> 42:41.373
No. They took her prisoner!

42:41.456 --> 42:43.750
I saw them take her over that rope bridge.

42:47.087 --> 42:48.880
Huh? Hmm.

42:49.005 --> 42:50.590
Huh?

42:51.257 --> 42:54.802
Oh! Candied seaweed!

42:56.261 --> 42:57.763
We're under an island?

42:57.888 --> 43:00.808
This is great! I'll find Leah,
but you have to get out of here.

43:01.475 --> 43:03.476
That boy sure likes ponds.

43:11.109 --> 43:12.902
Huh?

43:13.820 --> 43:16.780
Oh, no.

43:17.906 --> 43:20.701
This better be important.

43:22.619 --> 43:24.538
I'm missing my own party.

43:25.247 --> 43:26.623
You didn't tell her?

43:29.583 --> 43:32.420
You'll wanna see this, Your Nestrian-ness.

43:35.631 --> 43:36.841
Hmm...

43:37.800 --> 43:39.343
Hi!

43:39.467 --> 43:42.345
Okay, maybe we got off
on the wrong paw.

43:42.470 --> 43:44.472
But you guys are Nestrians, right?

43:44.597 --> 43:46.558
The friendliest creatures on Earth.

43:46.683 --> 43:48.685
You don't cage animals!

43:48.810 --> 43:50.937
What do you know about Nestrians?

43:51.062 --> 43:53.397
Lots! My best friend is a Nestrian.

43:54.064 --> 43:55.566
Do you think she means Finny?

43:55.691 --> 43:58.485
You've seen Finny? He's here?

43:58.610 --> 43:59.820
Open the door.

43:59.945 --> 44:01.405
Your Nestrian-ness, are you sure

44:01.530 --> 44:02.990
- that's, er...
- Hmm.

44:03.531 --> 44:04.699
Let me get that for you.

44:10.288 --> 44:12.707
Darn seagrass. Look like a fool...

44:14.083 --> 44:16.209
- Is Finny all right?
- Back, Grymp!

44:16.668 --> 44:18.462
- Hey!
- I said, "Back!"

44:23.008 --> 44:24.176
It's not safe here.

44:24.301 --> 44:26.261
Relax, it's just the colony settling.

44:26.386 --> 44:29.138
No, it's a volcano and it's ready to blow.

44:29.263 --> 44:31.098
We need to leave this place right now!

44:31.223 --> 44:32.600
There may be room on the Ark,

44:32.725 --> 44:34.143
but we have to get out of here.

44:34.268 --> 44:37.688
You want us to go running into the jaws
of your carnivorous friends?

44:37.813 --> 44:39.315
Do I look that stupid?

44:40.357 --> 44:42.359
Well, you are dressed like a chicken.

44:42.859 --> 44:45.528
That's what I said,
but it was too late to lose the seagrass.

44:45.654 --> 44:47.072
Clam it!

44:48.031 --> 44:49.866
You're not going anywhere.

44:50.825 --> 44:53.786
But... My friend Jelly is up there.

44:53.911 --> 44:56.997
She won't make it on her own. Please!

44:57.081 --> 44:58.707
Don't let this key out of your sight.

44:58.832 --> 45:02.586
Ugh! You couldn't wash it first?
That's my mouth!

45:04.295 --> 45:07.632
Er, one more thing,
Your High-Nestrian-ness.

45:07.757 --> 45:09.842
What now?

45:09.968 --> 45:12.512
Erm, it's the Ark.

45:12.637 --> 45:14.472
It's landed.

45:16.515 --> 45:18.517
I need to address the colony.

45:41.329 --> 45:44.082
Erm, I lost the boy.

45:45.291 --> 45:46.376
Come on!

45:46.501 --> 45:48.628
Here 's an idea. Go find him!

45:49.504 --> 45:52.464
Great. Now we're missing the party
because of you.

45:53.215 --> 45:54.425
Oh.

45:57.720 --> 46:00.973
Thanks!
Wait, what are you guys doing here?

46:01.098 --> 46:02.349
We've come to see...

46:02.474 --> 46:05.101
The horrible monster from the Ark.

46:05.226 --> 46:06.352
What monster?

46:06.477 --> 46:08.187
It's got sharp claws.

46:08.313 --> 46:09.522
And huge teeth.

46:09.647 --> 46:11.607
And golden stripes on its head.

46:11.733 --> 46:14.986
That's no monster, that's my best friend.
Do you know where she is?

46:16.653 --> 46:18.280
Yeah.

46:20.699 --> 46:22.868
It must be around here somewhere.

46:22.993 --> 46:23.952
I'm scared.

46:24.077 --> 46:27.164
Don't worry, kids,
she wouldn't hurt a fly!

46:28.831 --> 46:31.292
When I get out of here,
I'll crush you all like flies!

46:33.085 --> 46:35.129
She is a monster!

46:35.254 --> 46:36.547
Leah!

46:36.672 --> 46:38.049
Finny!

46:38.174 --> 46:41.134
I just knew
you were the horrible monster!

46:41.259 --> 46:42.344
Wait, I'm the what?

46:44.888 --> 46:45.930
It's locked.

46:46.056 --> 46:49.142
That old Nestrian lady hid the key
in her talking necklace.

46:49.267 --> 46:51.518
Patch? Don't worry, I'll get it.

46:51.644 --> 46:55.689
Hurry up! We've got to get out of here
before that volcano blows!

46:55.814 --> 46:56.940
Volcano?

46:57.066 --> 46:58.942
We've got a lot of catching up to do.

46:59.068 --> 47:00.235
Mm-hmm.

47:00.361 --> 47:02.071
- And Finny?
- Yeah?

47:02.738 --> 47:04.238
It's good to see you.

47:06.407 --> 47:07.617
You too.

47:28.302 --> 47:31.263
I hope you've all had a wonderful night.

47:31.389 --> 47:32.807
And before you go...

47:32.932 --> 47:35.267
Open your gift! Open it!

47:39.562 --> 47:43.566
I'm afraid there's an important matter
I need to discuss first.

47:46.152 --> 47:48.029
They really worked very hard on it.

47:48.154 --> 47:50.532
- You should probably take a look.
- Of course.

47:50.657 --> 47:52.241
How exciting.

47:58.455 --> 47:59.957
Lower the curtain!

48:05.420 --> 48:08.131
Wait for it...

48:18.140 --> 48:19.641
Boom!

48:21.101 --> 48:22.060
Oh.

48:25.230 --> 48:27.523
And you haven't even seen the best part.

48:27.648 --> 48:29.400
For years to come,

48:29.525 --> 48:33.863
Nestrians can look down
upon your magnificent colony

48:33.988 --> 48:37.867
from inside the observation butt!

48:39.492 --> 48:40.994
Oh! Er...

48:42.370 --> 48:44.914
You hate it. She hates it!

48:48.501 --> 48:51.670
No, no, no! I love it.

48:52.421 --> 48:55.215
Really? She loves it!

48:58.969 --> 49:01.764
Did he just say "observation butt"?

49:01.889 --> 49:03.890
We're not calling it that.

49:04.015 --> 49:07.727
What a lovely, er... gesture.

49:09.062 --> 49:11.606
And it warms my heart
to see us all together.

49:13.066 --> 49:15.192
Rejected by the rest
of the animal kingdom...

49:15.233 --> 49:16.360
I'll go this way.

49:16.401 --> 49:20.447
We built this colony as a safe place
where we could flourish and...

49:20.572 --> 49:24.076
Whoa! The colony rules!

49:26.995 --> 49:29.455
Thank you, madam.

49:29.538 --> 49:31.666
And how we have flourished.

49:31.791 --> 49:33.709
Proving to ourselves and the world

49:33.834 --> 49:36.504
that we don't need anyone else.

49:36.629 --> 49:40.006
However, I have just been informed
that the Ark,

49:40.131 --> 49:44.469
full of hungry animals,
has landed on our island.

49:47.222 --> 49:48.473
No need to panic.

49:48.598 --> 49:51.976
As long as we stay down here,
they won't even know we exist.

49:52.101 --> 49:54.395
Oh, er, didn't you say they was hungry?

49:54.520 --> 49:57.982
Starving! They've been at sea for months.

49:58.107 --> 50:01.151
But don't worry, the food on the island
will soon run out

50:01.277 --> 50:02.736
and they'll have to move on.

50:03.736 --> 50:05.029
Shouldn't we help them?

50:07.115 --> 50:08.324
Help them?

50:08.449 --> 50:11.619
Letting them starve
doesn't seem like the Nestrian way.

50:11.744 --> 50:15.414
What with the kindness and caring and all?

50:18.166 --> 50:21.545
You want to let them in here
to share your food? Be my guest!

50:22.170 --> 50:24.965
But what do you think they'll be eating
when the food runs out?

50:25.090 --> 50:27.008
Rocks?

50:27.633 --> 50:29.635
No, not rocks.

50:29.760 --> 50:30.845
You!

50:31.637 --> 50:33.764
Who, me?

50:36.475 --> 50:37.685
No.

50:37.810 --> 50:39.644
All of you!

50:45.734 --> 50:48.862
Exactly. So it's settled.

50:48.987 --> 50:51.280
Nobody comes in and nobody goes out.

50:51.822 --> 50:53.198
And remember...

50:53.699 --> 50:57.911
Stay secret. Stay safe. Stay sweet.

50:58.454 --> 51:00.623
That's right, my sweet Nestrians.

51:00.748 --> 51:02.958
Now, sleep well, everybody!

51:03.082 --> 51:06.294
See you tomorrow
for another day in paradise.

51:10.173 --> 51:13.217
Double the guards on the exits.
The colony is on lockdown.

51:13.343 --> 51:14.427
Yes, ma'am!

51:32.735 --> 51:35.363
Observation butt...

51:37.573 --> 51:40.742
Darn seagrass!

51:42.661 --> 51:43.954
- Leah!
- Finny!

51:44.496 --> 51:46.915
- Leah!
- Finny! Leah!

51:47.040 --> 51:48.291
Finny!

51:48.416 --> 51:50.126
Leah! Finny!

51:50.251 --> 51:52.169
Where are you?

51:52.294 --> 51:53.671
I don't like this.

51:53.796 --> 51:55.506
You look like Mama Leah...

51:55.631 --> 51:56.757
...only bigger.

51:56.882 --> 51:57.925
Who said that?

51:58.050 --> 52:02.596
And you look like Papa Finny,
only purple!

52:02.721 --> 52:04.222
You know Finny and Leah?

52:04.347 --> 52:05.640
Where are they?

52:05.765 --> 52:07.684
- Through that rock.
- Huh?

52:09.102 --> 52:10.436
Look!

52:11.020 --> 52:12.397
Take cover!

52:12.522 --> 52:15.482
Is it me
or is that tunnel getting longer?

52:15.607 --> 52:16.984
Huh?

52:19.778 --> 52:23.448
Phew. And it's getting hot out here too,
isn't it, huh?

52:23.573 --> 52:25.575
Nestrians!

52:25.701 --> 52:28.160
- They're the ones who took Leah!
- What?

52:28.286 --> 52:29.745
No, no, no, no, no, no.

52:29.829 --> 52:32.707
We Nestrians are the good guys!

52:32.832 --> 52:35.167
Let me talk to them and I will...

52:35.293 --> 52:38.796
No talking. We do this the Grymp way.

54:09.420 --> 54:12.423
The key! He took the key!

54:12.548 --> 54:15.884
Finny? Stop it right there!

54:16.009 --> 54:16.969
Guards?

54:17.094 --> 54:19.972
- Guards! Guards!
- Seriously?

54:20.097 --> 54:21.598
Guards!

54:23.558 --> 54:25.769
Oh, be careful, Clyde!

54:25.894 --> 54:26.978
It's Chief Clyde!

54:27.103 --> 54:28.145
Hmm.

54:35.194 --> 54:36.404
Ha! Huh?

54:37.113 --> 54:39.030
Let's go, we've gotta get out of here!

54:39.531 --> 54:40.949
Finny!

54:41.074 --> 54:42.200
Mm!

54:43.868 --> 54:44.953
Come on.

55:01.594 --> 55:02.844
Oh, no!

55:07.265 --> 55:08.891
I'm disappointed in you, Finny.

55:13.521 --> 55:14.771
Take them to the storage room.

55:17.816 --> 55:19.192
I'll inform Patch.

55:20.193 --> 55:22.654
- Big mistake!
- Let us go!

55:25.407 --> 55:29.327
Er... This isn't the way
to the storage room.

55:30.036 --> 55:32.079
Where are you taking us, buttfuzz?

55:32.204 --> 55:33.915
Watch your language, young lady!

55:34.040 --> 55:35.166
Mom?

55:37.460 --> 55:39.002
Oh, Mom!

55:40.253 --> 55:42.881
Hey, we agreed
I could do the dramatic reveal!

55:43.006 --> 55:44.090
Dad!

55:45.467 --> 55:47.218
- And me!
- Jelly!

55:50.055 --> 55:51.555
I've gotta stop doing that!

55:52.056 --> 55:54.600
We're sorry, Mom. About everything.

55:54.725 --> 55:56.810
Let's not worry about that now.

56:00.731 --> 56:03.066
I knew it!

56:03.191 --> 56:04.525
I don't understand it.

56:04.651 --> 56:08.905
I distinctly remember ordering
those two strangely unfamiliar guards

56:09.030 --> 56:10.490
to take them here.

56:12.075 --> 56:13.159
What?

56:14.327 --> 56:15.619
Oh.

56:19.081 --> 56:22.334
Whoa! Look at this place!

56:22.459 --> 56:23.627
I know, right?

56:23.752 --> 56:26.338
Does that statue
have an observation butt?

56:26.837 --> 56:29.632
Yup! And it shoots confetti
from the trunk!

56:29.757 --> 56:32.009
- Nice touch!
- Uh-huh.

56:32.134 --> 56:34.762
Guys! Come on! What about the volcano?

56:34.887 --> 56:36.931
Er, what volcano?

56:37.056 --> 56:38.599
Stop right there!

56:38.723 --> 56:40.558
And give us back our uniforms!

56:41.226 --> 56:43.436
Guards! Seize them!

56:46.231 --> 56:50.193
Patch, you have to let us go
and warn the other animals!

56:50.318 --> 56:52.069
- They're in great danger!
- Yeah!

56:52.194 --> 56:53.779
Erm... What danger?

56:53.904 --> 56:55.614
You disappoint me, Finny.

56:55.739 --> 56:58.742
I built this paradise
to keep us Nestrians safe

56:58.867 --> 57:01.078
from those treacherous creatures.

57:01.161 --> 57:02.620
If you keep us here,

57:02.745 --> 57:05.415
you haven't built a paradise,
you've built a prison.

57:05.540 --> 57:07.625
And you built it under a volcano!

57:07.750 --> 57:09.669
Erm, what volcano?

57:09.794 --> 57:11.629
That's enough about a volcano!

57:11.754 --> 57:14.173
Even if it were true,
we'd be safer down here

57:14.299 --> 57:16.758
than up there with those carnivores.

57:16.883 --> 57:20.012
If our time on the Ark
has taught us anything, it's...

57:20.137 --> 57:23.432
Never ever get into a tickle fight
with a hippo.

57:24.474 --> 57:26.476
No, Dave. It has taught us

57:26.601 --> 57:30.271
that it is possible for us animals
to put our differences aside and...

57:30.396 --> 57:32.440
No more speeches!

57:32.565 --> 57:34.191
Have it your way!

57:34.317 --> 57:35.610
Dave, Finny!

57:35.735 --> 57:37.111
- Huh?
- Grab on!

57:38.529 --> 57:40.405
Oh. Finny, come on!

57:45.118 --> 57:47.078
Whee!

57:49.372 --> 57:50.457
Hold on!

57:58.047 --> 57:59.465
Are you out of your mind?

57:59.590 --> 58:00.841
It worked, didn't it?

58:07.639 --> 58:10.975
Oh, let them go,
we'll never catch them now.

58:12.268 --> 58:14.603
Erm... about this volcano?

58:14.728 --> 58:16.647
Is that what the tremors were?

58:16.772 --> 58:18.732
Oh, pull yourselves together.

58:18.857 --> 58:20.150
There is no volcano.

58:20.275 --> 58:24.571
And even if there were, we're Nestrians,
we can always escape to the sea.

58:25.656 --> 58:29.158
Of course! You're right, you're right.

58:43.546 --> 58:45.048
I hate this.

58:45.173 --> 58:49.261
Can we not put towels on the loungers
unless we're actually using them?

58:49.386 --> 58:51.804
This is not how paradise works.

58:53.722 --> 58:54.974
Mmm.

58:57.685 --> 59:00.312
Hey, guys, what did I miss?

59:00.437 --> 59:03.189
Mmm, Hot tub! Lovely!

59:05.441 --> 59:08.069
Jacuzzi! Nice.

59:08.194 --> 59:10.822
How did we figure out
the whole bubble action?

59:18.412 --> 59:19.788
Mmm.

59:19.913 --> 59:22.416
Ernest, the usual.

59:22.541 --> 59:24.001
Very good, sir.

59:27.712 --> 59:30.006
Now, this is an Animal Kingdom.

59:31.507 --> 59:33.009
Yes, indeed, sir.

59:34.468 --> 59:37.513
Lenny! Leonard! Capt'n!

59:37.638 --> 59:41.808
Oh, good! You've found them. Namaste.

59:41.933 --> 59:43.977
We've got to evacuate the island!

59:44.102 --> 59:45.395
Oh, thank you.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.479
Right now!

59:46.605 --> 59:48.023
There's a volcano!

59:48.148 --> 59:50.191
And it's gonna blow!

59:50.317 --> 59:51.483
What are you talking about?

59:51.609 --> 59:53.819
It's true! We...

59:58.866 --> 01:00:01.577
What have you done to the Ark?

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.829
You destroyed the Ark to build a hot tub?

01:00:04.954 --> 01:00:07.415
No, no, no. We destroyed the Ark

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.586
to build three hot tubs,
a Tiki bar, and...

01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:12.837
Huh?

01:00:12.962 --> 01:00:14.963
...a games room!

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:22.179
Ah, it's a work in progress.
Relax, have a mocktail!

01:00:23.096 --> 01:00:24.306
VoilÃ , sir!

01:00:24.431 --> 01:00:27.016
A... A mocktail? Are you kidding?

01:00:28.184 --> 01:00:29.185
Wait,

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.020
am I getting a hint of cinnamon?

01:00:31.145 --> 01:00:32.897
You're not listening!

01:00:33.022 --> 01:00:35.733
There's a volcano right there
and it's ready to blow.

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:39.152
Nonsense. This is paradise!

01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:41.488
Huh?

01:00:53.749 --> 01:00:55.251
Huh?

01:01:21.275 --> 01:01:22.442
Oh, no!

01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:25.279
Oh, yeah, I'm beginning to think
there's something in that volcano rumour.

01:01:25.404 --> 01:01:26.529
Your Nestrian-ness!

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:29.073
We must evacuate the colony!

01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:35.705
This is not happening!

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:36.789
This is not happening!

01:01:36.914 --> 01:01:38.748
This is not happening!

01:01:41.418 --> 01:01:43.670
Er, which way is the emergency exit again?

01:01:43.795 --> 01:01:44.963
I think it's this way?

01:01:45.088 --> 01:01:47.173
Let's just go!

01:01:52.636 --> 01:01:56.974
All right, we rehearsed this!
Carry on! This way!

01:01:57.099 --> 01:02:02.021
Stay calm. That's right.
Evacuate through main exit one by one!

01:02:03.605 --> 01:02:05.440
Oh, no!

01:02:06.149 --> 01:02:07.233
Look out!

01:02:12.572 --> 01:02:14.573
The main exit! It's blocked!

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:15.782
What now?

01:02:15.908 --> 01:02:18.869
We have no choice,
we'll have to leave by the beach.

01:02:18.952 --> 01:02:22.331
Initiate emergency evacuation protocol!

01:02:25.584 --> 01:02:27.043
My fellow Nestrians,

01:02:27.168 --> 01:02:32.590
our beloved leader, Patch, has initiated
the emergency evacuation protocol.

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:36.135
Please proceed
to your assigned escape route.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:42.432
And remember, the situation is never
too dire to give one's neighbour a hug.

01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:45.644
What about all those savage animals
up there?

01:02:45.769 --> 01:02:49.189
We can only hope Finny was right
about the truce with the meat-eaters.

01:02:49.606 --> 01:02:52.441
We need to get all the Nestrians
safely to open water.

01:02:52.566 --> 01:02:53.525
Yes, ma'am!

01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:56.195
That means absolutely no contact
with the carnivores.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.281
- Yes, ma'am!
- You don't stop for anything or anyone.

01:02:59.406 --> 01:03:02.367
- Yes, ma'am! Right away!
- Now go! And that's an order!

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:04.827
Yes, ma'am!

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:06.579
Come on, come on!

01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:10.416
- Wait for us!
- Quickly, children!

01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:14.962
There you are.
Hurry up now, you're the last ones!

01:03:16.964 --> 01:03:18.590
Patch...

01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:32.186
Patch!

01:03:35.481 --> 01:03:38.733
The Ark. You're a Nestrian! Fix it!

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:42.153
How? We'd need an army of Nestrians
to fix it now!

01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:46.866
Keep the pace up, everyone.
We're almost there!

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:51.412
Ah, we're saved!

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.205
Huh?

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.332
Nestrians.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.585
Wild animals.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.379
Wild animals!

01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:04.299
Okay, everyone,
keep moving towards the beach.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.259
Nothing to see here.

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:10.972
That's it, keep moving.

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:20.022
Chief Clyde, we need your help
to rebuild the Ark.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:21.315
We need all of you!

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.567
Er, I have strict orders.

01:04:23.692 --> 01:04:25.986
But you can't turn your back on us now!

01:04:26.111 --> 01:04:28.446
The entire animal kingdom is at stake!

01:04:34.493 --> 01:04:36.245
I'd like to help you, Finny.

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:39.748
Really I would.
But Patch said that I, er...

01:04:39.873 --> 01:04:41.541
Er... Er...

01:05:00.017 --> 01:05:01.477
Ah, yeah, there we go.

01:05:17.157 --> 01:05:20.494
This is so wrong.

01:05:21.537 --> 01:05:25.332
Look alive, Nestrians,
we've got an Ark to rebuild!

01:05:28.376 --> 01:05:29.752
Thanks, Chief Clyde.

01:05:29.877 --> 01:05:32.380
Thanks! You can call me Clyde!

01:05:33.548 --> 01:05:37.802
All right, everyone, we need
to work together as a team.

01:05:38.343 --> 01:05:39.511
Dave?

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:42.722
Okay. Elephants, let's gather up the wood.

01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:47.394
And we need some vines for binding.
Uh, giraffes, I'm looking at you.

01:05:49.521 --> 01:05:51.730
All right, let's do this.

01:05:53.941 --> 01:05:55.693
Light as a feather, no problem!

01:05:56.443 --> 01:05:57.403
Pass it down!

01:05:57.528 --> 01:05:59.530
- Throw it to me!
- Okay!

01:06:00.948 --> 01:06:02.156
I got it!

01:06:05.535 --> 01:06:08.705
Oh... My games room.

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:09.873
Oh, dear!

01:06:16.962 --> 01:06:19.506
Huh?

01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:23.385
Oh, yeah.

01:06:37.064 --> 01:06:38.607
Finny! Finny!

01:06:38.732 --> 01:06:41.318
- Primrose needs to tell you something!
- What is it?

01:06:43.028 --> 01:06:44.779
It's Patch! She's still down there!

01:06:44.905 --> 01:06:46.323
- What?
- She...

01:06:46.448 --> 01:06:50.201
She saved us. But then the statue fell.

01:06:50.284 --> 01:06:52.203
And... And then...

01:06:52.328 --> 01:06:53.412
No...

01:06:57.166 --> 01:06:58.542
Don't even think about it.

01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:00.336
It's too dangerous.

01:07:00.461 --> 01:07:02.128
Somebody's gotta go back for her.

01:07:02.253 --> 01:07:03.338
Then I'm coming too.

01:07:03.463 --> 01:07:05.298
You'd never survive the swim.

01:07:05.423 --> 01:07:08.885
Besides, one of us needs to stay behind
and take care of Jelly.

01:07:10.803 --> 01:07:12.972
Hurry back.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.765
I will.

01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:16.767
Paw promise?

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:18.769
Paw promise.

01:07:27.318 --> 01:07:30.321
Don't worry, Jelly, he'll be fi... Huh?

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:31.656
Jelly flop!

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.866
What? No! Come back!

01:07:33.991 --> 01:07:35.284
Whoo-hoo!

01:08:13.278 --> 01:08:15.529
Patch! Where are you?

01:08:15.654 --> 01:08:17.197
Huh?

01:08:25.037 --> 01:08:26.913
Patch!

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:31.877
Patch?

01:08:32.711 --> 01:08:35.380
Finny. What are you doing here?

01:08:35.505 --> 01:08:38.591
Nestrians never neglect no-one in need!

01:08:44.096 --> 01:08:47.642
This was supposed to be
our forever home.

01:08:48.143 --> 01:08:49.852
Now look at it!

01:08:49.975 --> 01:08:53.189
My life's work is...

01:08:53.314 --> 01:08:54.689
...destroyed.

01:08:58.694 --> 01:09:00.529
We have to leave now!

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:04.282
Great! Because I'm really starting
to like the sound of this Ark.

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:07.577
I don't think I...

01:09:07.702 --> 01:09:09.578
...can.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:12.372
Stay with us, Patch.
The Nestrians need you!

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:16.417
The Nestrians need a strong leader now.

01:09:16.542 --> 01:09:18.336
They'll be better off...

01:09:18.461 --> 01:09:20.214
...without me.

01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:24.343
That's not true.
They need you now more than ever.

01:09:24.468 --> 01:09:27.136
The Nestrians are gonna
have to start again.

01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:30.305
Do you really think they can build
another colony without you?

01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:36.728
Another colony?

01:09:40.356 --> 01:09:42.066
Patch.

01:09:43.151 --> 01:09:44.361
Patch?

01:09:46.029 --> 01:09:47.529
Wake up, Patch!

01:09:49.365 --> 01:09:50.866
Wake up, Patch!

01:09:51.698 --> 01:09:54.787
I... I think... I think she's gone.

01:09:55.704 --> 01:09:56.914
No...

01:10:18.725 --> 01:10:20.477
- Finny...
- Jelly?

01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:23.272
Is the old lady asleep?

01:10:23.981 --> 01:10:26.107
I'm afraid she's not asleep, Jelly.

01:10:30.319 --> 01:10:31.362
You mean...

01:10:33.364 --> 01:10:35.491
Come on, Jelly,

01:10:35.575 --> 01:10:36.951
we have to go!

01:10:37.076 --> 01:10:39.119
Argh, what is wrong with me?

01:10:39.244 --> 01:10:40.662
Wait!

01:10:42.247 --> 01:10:45.000
Ah! Come here, Jelly.

01:10:52.965 --> 01:10:54.008
Clear!

01:10:58.929 --> 01:11:00.097
Ouch.

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.682
Morning, sleepy head.

01:11:01.806 --> 01:11:04.684
You're alive! You're alive!

01:11:04.809 --> 01:11:06.394
Very much so.

01:11:09.772 --> 01:11:11.149
We gotta go. Follow me!

01:11:11.274 --> 01:11:13.109
No! I can't swim any more.

01:11:13.901 --> 01:11:15.861
There's no way out for me.

01:11:15.986 --> 01:11:17.487
Oh, yes, there is!

01:11:17.613 --> 01:11:18.739
How?

01:11:18.864 --> 01:11:20.616
In your butt!

01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:21.783
Huh?

01:11:23.577 --> 01:11:24.536
Huh?

01:11:27.538 --> 01:11:30.374
Hold on, everyone!

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:42.969
Faster, Finny, faster!

01:11:43.094 --> 01:11:45.722
I know! But how?

01:11:47.807 --> 01:11:48.975
What?

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.351
Jelly! Hit me!

01:11:50.893 --> 01:11:51.977
Really?

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:55.272
Do it, Jelly! Now!

01:11:56.357 --> 01:11:57.441
You got it!

01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.709
Yay!

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:22.548
Whee!

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:36.477
Ahh! Here we come!

01:12:50.656 --> 01:12:52.491
Ha-ha, we made it!

01:12:54.368 --> 01:12:55.870
Oh, no!

01:12:55.995 --> 01:12:57.580
This isn't the Ark.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.384
Oh, please, come on,
let's get this done!

01:13:11.509 --> 01:13:12.594
Come on! Oh!

01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:14.511
There you go. All done!

01:13:14.636 --> 01:13:16.513
Anchors away, Captain!

01:13:16.889 --> 01:13:17.973
Well done!

01:13:19.474 --> 01:13:21.310
Quickly now, keep moving.

01:13:21.727 --> 01:13:26.063
Giraffes, hippos, hyaenas,
prairie dogs, check.

01:13:27.523 --> 01:13:28.566
Boarding complete, Captain!

01:13:28.691 --> 01:13:31.027
Very well, then let's get out of here!

01:13:31.152 --> 01:13:33.154
- Wait! We can't leave!
- Huh?

01:13:33.279 --> 01:13:36.240
We have to!
The whole island is about to blow!

01:13:36.365 --> 01:13:38.325
But Finny is still out there!

01:13:38.408 --> 01:13:40.911
- What?
- He went back down to save Patch!

01:13:41.036 --> 01:13:42.454
And Jelly went after him!

01:13:42.579 --> 01:13:44.080
Kids.

01:13:48.335 --> 01:13:49.919
That's got to be...

01:13:50.044 --> 01:13:51.378
DAVE, HAZEL, AND LEAH: Finny!

01:13:51.504 --> 01:13:53.339
You go back on board!
We'll go and get Finny!

01:13:53.464 --> 01:13:56.008
- But, I...
- Forget it! It's too dangerous!

01:13:57.384 --> 01:13:58.427
Back soon!

01:13:58.552 --> 01:14:00.429
Hurry up, we can't wait forever!

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.642
Hmm...

01:14:17.945 --> 01:14:19.780
Ah...

01:14:21.031 --> 01:14:22.866
That should get their attention!

01:14:25.369 --> 01:14:28.496
I'm sorry, Finny. I truly am.

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:30.331
It's not your fault.

01:14:30.456 --> 01:14:31.916
Oh, but it is.

01:14:32.041 --> 01:14:34.377
I've been so blinded by my past

01:14:34.502 --> 01:14:36.921
that I have taken away your future.

01:14:38.004 --> 01:14:40.674
I should have listened to your friend.

01:14:41.299 --> 01:14:43.218
Well, why don't you
tell her that yourself?

01:14:43.343 --> 01:14:44.553
Hey!

01:14:45.178 --> 01:14:47.597
Finny! Jelly!

01:14:48.181 --> 01:14:49.516
It's Leah!

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.183
Mama Leah!

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:00.776
Jump on!

01:15:01.402 --> 01:15:02.485
Yeah!

01:15:21.628 --> 01:15:24.047
It's useless. There is no way through!

01:15:24.173 --> 01:15:25.382
Same here.

01:15:30.803 --> 01:15:32.680
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, Dad!

01:15:32.805 --> 01:15:35.141
There they are!

01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:41.313
Oh, no!

01:15:47.235 --> 01:15:50.070
They're coming in hot!

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.954
We can't wait any longer!

01:16:01.956 --> 01:16:02.916
Huh?

01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:05.919
Look! Look, everyone, it's Finny!

01:16:06.044 --> 01:16:08.296
And is that... Patch?

01:16:09.005 --> 01:16:11.341
What on earth are they doing up there?

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:12.634
They're on fire!

01:16:24.186 --> 01:16:25.520
I got you!

01:16:25.645 --> 01:16:27.104
Are all accounted for?

01:16:35.863 --> 01:16:37.365
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

01:16:44.287 --> 01:16:45.497
Go! Go! Go!

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.334
All Nestrians, in position!

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:50.584
Ready!

01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:54.839
Set!

01:16:56.507 --> 01:16:59.635
Blow!

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.140
Whoa!

01:17:26.325 --> 01:17:27.952
- Leah!
- Finny!

01:17:28.536 --> 01:17:29.620
Dad.

01:17:30.121 --> 01:17:32.206
Huh?

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.462
Close call.

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:42.424
I don't know about you guys,
but I think this calls for a...

01:17:42.549 --> 01:17:45.719
- Group hug! Yay!
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:17:49.722 --> 01:17:53.225
Dave's log, day 173.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:56.812
And welcome to the Ark 2.0!

01:17:59.732 --> 01:18:03.568
Just when we thought
life on the Ark couldn't get any worse...

01:18:04.277 --> 01:18:06.946
Boom! It couldn't get any better!

01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:10.909
And all that was needed
was a few hundred Nestrians.

01:18:10.992 --> 01:18:14.161
But it's not just the Ark
that's looking better.

01:18:14.286 --> 01:18:18.624
Now that the Nestrians have taught us all
a thing or two about seafood,

01:18:18.749 --> 01:18:21.293
the menu's not too shabby either.

01:18:22.377 --> 01:18:24.463
Oh, I'll have another one of those.

01:18:25.338 --> 01:18:28.841
Ah, this is the life.

01:18:29.801 --> 01:18:33.221
I have to admit it, Finny, you were right.

01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:36.224
And you said seagrass
wouldn't work on a barbecue.

01:18:37.933 --> 01:18:42.646
Actually, I meant about life
being good on the Ark.

01:18:42.771 --> 01:18:44.397
Cheers!

01:18:44.523 --> 01:18:47.150
Oh! Right! Yeah!

01:18:47.275 --> 01:18:49.735
But the seagrass works too.

01:18:52.530 --> 01:18:54.782
You disobeyed me.

01:18:54.865 --> 01:18:58.619
Your orders were not to engage
with the wild animals of the Ark,

01:18:58.744 --> 01:19:00.204
General Clyde.

01:19:00.329 --> 01:19:02.247
Er, I'm sorry about that.

01:19:02.372 --> 01:19:04.999
But actually, it's Chie... Wait, what?

01:19:05.124 --> 01:19:07.752
Really? Hah. A promotion?

01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:11.589
You showed real leadership.
It was the right thing to do.

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:15.801
Oh, somebody needs a hug! Aw.

01:19:16.802 --> 01:19:19.763
Here's your drinks, madame.
Two snuggles on the beach.

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.557
I can't believe
that we were in a storm,

01:19:21.682 --> 01:19:24.685
a shipwreck, a kidnapping,
a prison break, a collapsing colony,

01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:28.354
a submarine, a crash landing,
and a huge erupting volcano!

01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:31.065
That was so much fun!

01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:33.985
Well, from now on, being sensible is fun.

01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:36.195
When you ran off on me,
I was worried sick!

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.114
Leah's right. If we're going to be
taking care of you,

01:19:39.197 --> 01:19:41.408
there's got to be some ground rules,
young lady.

01:19:41.533 --> 01:19:45.579
Wow. You know,
you two really have grown up a lot.

01:19:45.704 --> 01:19:48.665
Yeah. Maybe it is time we started
treating you like grown-ups.

01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:52.001
Are you nuts?
We don't want to be grown-ups!

01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:53.502
Ugh. What's with all the pressure?

01:19:53.627 --> 01:19:55.754
Why can't you just let us be kids?

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.007
Erm... Okay.

01:19:58.132 --> 01:20:00.050
Thank you!

01:20:00.176 --> 01:20:03.386
Oh, excuse me?
Two peanut bars and two cocotinis.

01:20:03.511 --> 01:20:05.263
- Oh!
- Your order, madam.

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:07.891
- Yum.
- Er, can I get an olive in this?

01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:10.185
Huh?

01:20:14.354 --> 01:20:16.899
Now, that's what I call service.

01:20:17.024 --> 01:20:20.068
Wait, it's the Dove! He's back!

01:20:24.323 --> 01:20:26.824
Does this mean you found land?

01:20:29.243 --> 01:20:30.953
And we can finally leave the Ark?

01:20:38.168 --> 01:20:39.628
Well done!

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:42.172
Seriously, well done.

01:20:42.297 --> 01:20:44.466
Very impressive.

01:20:44.591 --> 01:20:47.511
The thing is,

01:20:47.636 --> 01:20:50.930
we thought we might just stay
on the Ark a little longer.

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:53.057
Huh?

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:58.145
Aw! That's right, sit down,
take a load off.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:00.815
Erm, let me get you a drink!

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.191
Hey, guys!

01:21:03.316 --> 01:21:05.318
What did I miss, eh?

01:22:27.268 --> 01:22:32.148
How long have I journeyed on

01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:37.360
Just to hear your voice on the wind?

01:22:39.738 --> 01:22:45.368
Head in the clouds
All I see is horizon

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:50.831
Thinking aloud
That the price to keep my eyes on

01:22:50.956 --> 01:22:55.753
Was already near...

01:22:58.756 --> 01:23:05.720
When all around us has come undone

01:23:06.888 --> 01:23:13.727
Our dreams on hold and our songs unsung

01:23:14.353 --> 01:23:20.651
We can't go back to what we knew

01:23:22.444 --> 01:23:29.408
But I stand for hope
When I stand with you

01:23:42.379 --> 01:23:47.467
How can I keep holding on

01:23:48.135 --> 01:23:52.888
To a dream that's fading away?

01:23:54.723 --> 01:24:00.396
Searching for home in the wrong direction

01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:05.525
Never alone with you as my protection

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:10.864
There's nothing to fear

01:24:10.947 --> 01:24:17.870
When all around us has come undone

01:24:17.995 --> 01:24:24.835
Our dreams on hold and our songs unsung

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:31.757
We can't go back to what we knew

01:24:31.883 --> 01:24:38.346
I stand for hope when I stand with you

01:25:00.743 --> 01:25:07.081
In times of challenge
We'll work as one

01:25:07.207 --> 01:25:12.837
We walk divided
Together we run

01:25:13.504 --> 01:25:19.635
And now we're building something new

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:25.932
I stand for hope when I stand with you

01:25:26.057 --> 01:25:32.230
Though all around us has come undone

01:25:32.355 --> 01:25:38.193
There are dreams to share
and songs to be sung

01:25:38.318 --> 01:25:44.324
So hear our voices loud and true

01:25:44.407 --> 01:25:50.121
We sing for hope when we sing with you

01:25:50.621 --> 01:25:56.794
Together we'll build something new

01:25:57.503 --> 01:26:03.341
We stand for hope and we stand

01:26:03.466 --> 01:26:07.846
With you
