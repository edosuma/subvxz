WEBVTT

01:04.147 --> 01:09.069
Fuck.
Man, this is never gonna work.

01:09.111 --> 01:13.156
I don't see a baby.
I see, like, an orange-ish blob.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.704
I mean... I don't know,
is it supposed to...?

01:19.621 --> 01:21.081
Penka?

01:29.715 --> 01:31.258
Silvio?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.552
SILVIO: Oh, I forgot
your milk, Penka.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.013
Silvio! No, it's not...
Come here now.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.141
-What's up?
-Um...

01:39.183 --> 01:41.435
-What's up?
-I think she... Oh.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.564
What? Penka?

01:52.154 --> 01:53.155
Penka.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.531
-(WOMAN GASPS)
-Oh.

02:02.581 --> 02:06.043
(BACKGROUND CHATTER)

02:07.753 --> 02:11.256
Le garçon. Et tu fais.
Et tu fais.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.883
(BABY COOS)

02:14.551 --> 02:17.221
Sure. You have
multi-instrumentalist vibes.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.847
-That's why I ask.
-Oh, OK.

02:18.889 --> 02:26.605
My labor was
54 hours and 45 minutes.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.315
Think about
the symmetry of that.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.274
Yeah. Whew.

02:29.316 --> 02:33.070
I mean, after hour 12,
just gimme the epidural.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.490
I mean, it's just, like...
I just wanna be numb, you know?

02:36.532 --> 02:39.201
To be honest, I've been
chipping with the oxies already.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.495
It's my lower back.
It's been killing me.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.372
An oxy here and there's
not gonna hurt the baby.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.123
OK, she's... she's...

02:45.165 --> 02:46.959
-She's kidding.
-Oh. (LAUGHS)

02:47.000 --> 02:49.127
-She's kidding.
-No, I'm not.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.754
(CHUCKLES)

02:50.796 --> 02:54.091
So have you found
a replacement?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.050
WOMAN: A replacement?

02:55.092 --> 02:57.553
-For poor sweet Penka.
-WOMAN: Oh.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.930
Um, well, we did
just kind of talk about

02:59.972 --> 03:01.306
doing a hospital birth.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.433
-Did we, though?
-What?

03:03.475 --> 03:05.519
First of all, slow your roll.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.272
I mean, it's like,
we're pretty far along as it is,

03:08.313 --> 03:10.315
and Penka was kinda
the only person

03:10.357 --> 03:11.692
that I would want to do...

03:11.733 --> 03:13.944
Well, but Penka...
Penka was special.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.696
So special. So special.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.700
Right, but... It doesn't mean
there aren't more...

03:19.741 --> 03:22.452
-other special...
-I think that we're just...

03:22.494 --> 03:24.705
-We're still figuring it out.
-Yeah.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.333
Sounds like you two
are still figuring it out.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.056
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.644
Do you know what that is?

03:49.188 --> 03:50.689
Cabbage.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.317
And this one?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.654
-Cabbage again.
-Right.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.949
-A lot of cabbage.
-Hm-hmm.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.497
Boys, can I have
your attention, please?

04:08.999 --> 04:11.585
MAN: Boys? Hi.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.007
Do you know why
everyone's here today?

04:19.343 --> 04:20.928
My mommy died.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.389
Do you remember Penka?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.433
She was there
when you were born.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.478
Her hands were the first
human hands to ever touch you.

04:31.647 --> 04:35.651
Do you know where you were
before you came to this world?

04:35.692 --> 04:39.363
Do you know where you go
when you leave?

04:39.404 --> 04:45.202
You walk, just like Penka,
back over the Rainbow Bridge.

04:45.244 --> 04:49.164
But everyone you leave behind
will stay here

04:49.206 --> 04:51.166
and be very, very sad.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.086
Your mommy, your daddy,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.589
everyone you ever loved will be
very sad that you're gone.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.968
And you, Thor, and you, Erik,

05:01.009 --> 05:03.428
you won't be Thor
and you won't be Erik anymore.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.099
-Who will we be?
-You'll be nothing.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.892
Then your bodies
will burn into dust

05:08.934 --> 05:12.479
and... everything you thought
you were will be no more.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.776
MAN: Hmm.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.282
(MAN CHUCKLES)

05:27.035 --> 05:28.579
What did we call it
when we were kids

05:28.620 --> 05:30.747
or what did they call it
in comic books?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
X-ray vision, right?

05:34.084 --> 05:39.590
You could see through people's
pants and shirts, right?

05:41.550 --> 05:43.177
Superpower.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.723
It's what Penka had.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.893
Those of you who knew her
know what I'm talking about.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.187
Now, by saying that she
could see into this mystery,

05:53.228 --> 05:56.732
am I saying that
she had all the answers? No.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.944
Did she have the ability
to change the outcome? No.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.530
No, she didn't.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.574
Because in the end,

06:05.616 --> 06:08.911
we are all, and can only be,
servants to the will of God

06:08.952 --> 06:11.205
and not even Penka knew that.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.374
Isn't that...

06:15.542 --> 06:18.170
Isn't that beautiful?

06:18.212 --> 06:25.427
That fine line between...
and she, you know?

06:25.469 --> 06:31.767
We can use reason so much to get
to the bottom of things, right?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.602
We wanna be able
to figure it out.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.396
I wanna get to the bottom.
Where's it going? Oh.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.984
Where'd it go?

06:41.026 --> 06:44.571
It's a hundred miles back
that way. It's fucking gone.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.240
It's fucking gone.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.207
You cut down a tree
to see what's inside.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.834
What do you wind up with?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.421
A dead tree, right?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.968
So the tree is a tree.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.805
Penka is Penka.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.683
Let us rejoice in her now
in God's name.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.269
Amen.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.860
Sascha?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.724
(WHISPERS) Who's that?

07:55.559 --> 07:57.394
(WHISPERS) That's Penka's son.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.553
How's school?

09:12.594 --> 09:15.848
-BOY: G-O-O-D.
-Really?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.099
That's not what your mom said.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.935
Whatever she tells you, I did
not get sent home from school.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.729
Yes, you did!
You got sent home from school.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.190
-Hi, Silvio.
-Hi.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.859
WOMAN: Yes, he did
get sent home from school

09:26.900 --> 09:28.819
for leaving the classroom
without permission.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.112
Hmm. Will?

09:30.153 --> 09:34.116
-Where are you going?
-I'm getting ice cream. Chill!

09:34.157 --> 09:37.911
Ice cream, really? I mean...

09:37.953 --> 09:40.998
-Whatever.
-How's it going over there?

09:42.499 --> 09:44.877
Will, can you go out back
for a second?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.921
-Why?
-I need to talk to Daddy alone.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.756
Yeah. It's just...
I'd be more comfortable

09:49.798 --> 09:51.216
if you didn't do that.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.301
WOMAN: Do what?

09:52.342 --> 09:54.344
Just the whole,
"I need to talk to Daddy."

09:54.386 --> 09:56.889
Just, "I need to speak
to your father,"

09:56.930 --> 09:58.974
or, "I need to talk
to your dad."

09:59.016 --> 10:00.142
Just... it's better that way

10:00.184 --> 10:02.561
because otherwise, it seems
like we're still together.

10:02.603 --> 10:06.064
-OK.
-Well, don't be mad.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.275
No, it's fine.
We're definitely not together.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.110
So don't... you don't
have to do the thing...

10:10.152 --> 10:12.279
So, did you, um, get a chance

10:12.321 --> 10:15.032
to think
about what we talked about?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.534
-Yeah and, um...
-What did you decide?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.203
Because I've been thinking
about it

10:19.244 --> 10:21.538
and he really needs
his father right now.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.123
Totally. There's just
a lot of things

10:23.165 --> 10:24.208
on this side of it, Natasha.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.418
Like, we have to get
a bigger house

10:26.460 --> 10:28.086
and the baby's coming soon.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.631
-I know. Exciting.
-Hm-hmm.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.342
The only thing...

10:33.383 --> 10:35.802
I have this yoga retreat
in Tulum

10:35.844 --> 10:38.847
coming up
right around winter break.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.183
OK. So, like, in three months.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.893
Well, right, but I need to book

10:42.935 --> 10:45.270
the plane ticket
and the hotel now.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.564
Oh, I see.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.234
So, can you take him?

10:52.486 --> 10:55.697
Yeah. I mean,
what I was gonna say

10:55.739 --> 10:58.617
was we talked about it and yes,

10:58.659 --> 11:00.369
we can take him.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.330
-And be happy to.
-Really? That's great.

11:03.372 --> 11:06.208
-What are you doing?
-I mean, I think you're right.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.544
-He needs his dad.
-I'll start packing his stuff.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.381
-Bye, Will.
-Daddy says, "Bye, Will."

11:12.422 --> 11:13.674
Yeah, seriously. Goodbye.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.509
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.387
Holy shit!

11:18.428 --> 11:20.305
-Hi.
-Oh, sorry.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.473
I'm Sascha.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.059
People don't usually
come that way.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.019
Just... around the front.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.188
OK, Lev. Bounce pass.
Here he goes.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.315
-OK.
-Layup.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.609
He's coming in hot.
He's coming in hot.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.903
-Yeah!
-Yes!

11:34.945 --> 11:36.822
Yes, all right.
No, Lev. That's good.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.907
If you blow the layup,
don't grab the board.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.784
You just circle back,
you try it again.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.536
-OK.
-You crush.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.205
Madonna, you ready? Bounce pass.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.583
Here she goes,
here she goes, here she goes.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.876
She's up.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.963
-(CHEERING)
-Sick!

11:53.005 --> 11:56.049
WOMAN: Guys, this is so sweet.

11:56.091 --> 11:59.428
But, I mean, I'm really
not gonna be gone for that long.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.346
Like, maybe six months tops.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.891
So I don't really see the reason
for all this cake and shit.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.560
Although,
I do really appreciate it.

12:06.602 --> 12:08.312
Um, I don't know,

12:08.353 --> 12:11.231
maybe some of you guys won't
be here by the time I get back.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.150
I mean, you guys
aren't looking too good.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.778
It's real. Let it sink in.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.239
And if that's the case, I do
wanna take this moment to say

12:19.281 --> 12:22.451
that you guys are the best damn
basketball team of octogenarians

12:22.492 --> 12:25.370
that I've ever had the pleasure
to coach.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.539
You guys, just please keep
running your drills and shit.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.626
You're getting good,
really good,

12:30.667 --> 12:33.170
and I'm super proud of you.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.426
God, that is sickly sweet. Lev,
stay away from this stuff, OK?

12:39.468 --> 12:41.345
It's gonna put you
in a diabetic coma, yeah?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.222
I can have a little.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.849
(TYPING)

12:52.189 --> 12:53.690
(SIGHS)

12:55.234 --> 12:57.152
I'm sorry, man, I... I...

12:57.194 --> 13:01.740
I don't know what Deb did with
your mom's, uh, effects, but...

13:01.782 --> 13:04.618
-She'll be back.
-I have nowhere to be.

13:07.955 --> 13:12.042
Did you want a water or a...?
I have water. I have, um...

13:14.044 --> 13:15.629
No, no, no, no. I'm good.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.382
SASCHA: I drink a lot of soup.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.262
-Yeah, that's not your mom's.
-Are you an artist?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
I am, actually,
but that's not...

13:25.347 --> 13:27.391
That's not mine,
that's a Grigor.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.684
But then that...

13:28.725 --> 13:31.061
Yeah. That one is mine.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.108
-Beautiful.
-Thanks.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.988
Yeah, your mom wasn't much of
a reader from what I could tell.

13:41.029 --> 13:44.449
-Books are heavy.
-Yeah, I guess that's true.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.827
Every time I move,
I'm like, "Ugh, the books."

13:46.869 --> 13:49.663
-Do you move a lot?
-No.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.211
Your son?

13:56.253 --> 13:59.047
-Yup, that's Will.
-Does he like Deb?

13:59.089 --> 14:01.633
They haven't met yet,
funnily enough.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.927
Hmm.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.472
-He wasn't born at home, was he?
-No, in a hospital.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.932
How was that?

14:08.974 --> 14:12.644
I wanted a home birth, actually,
but his mother... didn't.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.273
Safety, sanity,
security, sterility.

14:16.315 --> 14:18.609
-Sure.
-Stereotypical. (CHUCKLES)

14:24.198 --> 14:27.409
Sorry. Oh.

14:27.451 --> 14:30.204
Oh, now that.
Yeah, now that is your mom's.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.623
I don't know what it is, though.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.291
Oh.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.879
Is that for, um...

14:41.548 --> 14:44.551
She was almost 50 when she
had me. Did you know that?

14:46.136 --> 14:48.430
She was a whore at the time.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.474
Sex worker, if you like.

14:50.516 --> 14:54.895
Yeah. She was turning tricks
until I was nine.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.355
If you didn't have
a lot of money,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.857
that's just how you got along
at Rajneeshpuram

14:58.899 --> 15:00.692
if you were a woman.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.529
Then she traded in
her hooking boots for these.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.075
I came to it first.

15:08.116 --> 15:11.161
I led her on the path.

15:11.203 --> 15:14.915
There was this girl in camp,
Yamuna.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.044
God, I loved her.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.463
She was pregnant
by her boyfriend Mark

15:21.505 --> 15:23.632
who was facing
several indictments

15:23.674 --> 15:25.384
for cocaine trafficking.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.220
As the summer got hotter

15:28.262 --> 15:31.223
and her belly
grew more round and full,

15:31.265 --> 15:34.393
I found myself by her side
more often than not,

15:34.434 --> 15:38.355
helping her with cleaning
and calisthenics,

15:38.397 --> 15:40.607
whatever was required.

15:42.568 --> 15:47.698
We'd talk all night long
about big subjects,

15:47.739 --> 15:49.783
nature of things.

15:51.910 --> 15:55.956
Then when her time came,
I helped her.

15:57.374 --> 16:01.295
I was only nine years old,
but it was like

16:01.336 --> 16:07.134
my hands were being guided
by some unseen energy.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.137
I can see 'em now like daylight.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.681
My hands moving to her forehead,

16:12.723 --> 16:17.644
down to her belly, reaching
for the neck of the womb.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.856
Opening.

16:20.898 --> 16:27.529
Opening just the same way
the earth cracks and yawns,

16:27.571 --> 16:30.365
revealing her eternity.
(CHUCKLES)

16:34.119 --> 16:36.955
Hours later,
when Penka discovered us

16:36.997 --> 16:40.959
all wrapped up
together under the stars,

16:41.001 --> 16:43.045
she was so moved
by the sight of me

16:43.086 --> 16:45.923
still elbow-deep
in dried sanguine fluid

16:45.964 --> 16:49.134
that... it changed her.

16:51.470 --> 16:54.348
We were known
all over Rajneeshpuram.

16:54.389 --> 16:57.017
The old midwife and her son.

16:59.353 --> 17:02.439
Those were heady days, by God.

17:02.481 --> 17:06.484
Wait. So, so...
you're a midwife?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.445
I'm a doula.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.867
Stay right there.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.287
Uh...

17:18.829 --> 17:20.665
Can I take your picture?

17:21.583 --> 17:23.544
-Yeah.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

17:23.585 --> 17:26.046
-Like this?
-Sure.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.345
(CAMERA CLICKS)

17:34.972 --> 17:38.350
How did you...
How did you know what to do?

17:38.392 --> 17:41.854
How did the baby know
what to do, or Yamuna?

17:41.895 --> 17:45.190
I mean, haven't you ever been
guided by something,

17:45.232 --> 17:46.608
and you just know?

17:47.651 --> 17:49.278
I think so.

17:58.370 --> 18:00.080
You've got a great eye.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.916
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

18:11.383 --> 18:14.219
(HARMONICA PLAYING)

18:14.261 --> 18:15.721
(GATE SQUEAKS)

18:43.290 --> 18:45.209
You know, we would've made room
for her in the house,

18:45.250 --> 18:49.296
but she always insisted
on staying out here.

18:49.338 --> 18:53.383
SASCHA: She swiped it off
a blown-up convoy outside Blaj.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.555
I don't think
she spent a night away from it.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.101
This was her home. (SOBS)

19:03.143 --> 19:07.022
Oh, man. I'm so, so sorry.

19:07.064 --> 19:10.609
Oh, God, I'm embarrassing
myself. I didn't know...

19:10.651 --> 19:13.111
I didn't know being here
would be so hard.

19:13.153 --> 19:17.241
-I should've packed it up.
-Please, please don't.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.326
Just...

19:19.368 --> 19:20.327
I feel like if we take it down,

19:20.369 --> 19:21.954
then that will be
the last of her.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.998
She was a great lady.

19:27.543 --> 19:30.420
I really regret taking that job
in Kinshasa.

19:30.462 --> 19:32.339
SILVIO:
Well, you couldn't have known.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.342
She was 90.

19:38.512 --> 19:39.847
Listen.

19:41.348 --> 19:45.227
Why don't you just, you know...
why don't you stay?

19:45.269 --> 19:48.105
No, no. I couldn't.
Not without Deb's approval.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.691
We're actually in a bind here.
We could really use the help.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.985
-You'd be helping us out.
-How far along is she?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.945
She's six weeks out
from her window.

19:54.987 --> 19:55.946
The home stretch.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.489
SILVIO:
You could stay here in the tent,

19:57.531 --> 19:59.074
if you'd be comfortable,
of course.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.909
You know that thing
you just said

20:00.951 --> 20:03.120
about being guided by something?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.540
That's how this feels.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.418
(EXHALES)

20:12.254 --> 20:13.881
-Very well.
-Great.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.592
(LAUGHS)

20:16.633 --> 20:18.427
Do you have a bag or anything?

20:18.468 --> 20:20.470
No. I'll borrow.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.097
OK, I mean,
we have plenty of things.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.641
I mean, we look like
we're about the same size.

20:24.683 --> 20:25.934

-How are your erections?
-My...?

20:30.981 --> 20:33.275
-SASCHA: Are you getting them?
-SILVIO: Yeah. No. Yeah.

20:33.317 --> 20:34.610
I was curious because,

20:34.651 --> 20:37.279
uh, my ladies often
say that they need that.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.615
But their guys, they get
a little nervous about it,

20:39.656 --> 20:41.200
especially
in the third trimester.

20:41.241 --> 20:44.036
-SILVIO: Oh, yeah. No, we're...
-SASCHA: No, but it's important.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.206
-...by stimulating orgasms.
-I did not know that.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.415
Got some shopping in.

20:48.457 --> 20:49.791
-Hey!
-Hi.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.627
-Hi.
-Hello.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.504
-Uh...
-Here, let me.

20:53.545 --> 20:56.423
Oh, no, you don't... What, are
you putting this guy to work?

20:56.465 --> 20:58.884
(WHISPERS)
You what? He's a what?

20:58.926 --> 21:01.220
Yeah, the tent's still up
so I hired him.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.889
-Oh, my God, are you insane?
-No, why would you say that?

21:03.931 --> 21:05.349
Because you didn't even ask me.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.808
But I figured
we needed somebody.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.602
But we said that
we were gonna talk about this.

21:08.644 --> 21:10.395
-SASCHA: Hey, Deb?
-Yeah?

21:10.437 --> 21:11.980
SASCHA: For the tea.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.150
-Milk, please.
-Done and done.

21:15.192 --> 21:17.069
Do you need help
finding where stuff is, or...?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.988
No, it's very intuitive.
I'm good.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.740
You should hear him
talk about midwifery.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.034
-It's really inspiring.
-I'm sure.

21:24.076 --> 21:27.496
-Look, he just lost his mom.
-I know.

21:27.538 --> 21:29.831
Deb, if it's not working out,
it's not working out.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.875
We'll just be like, "Hey, man,
it's not working out."

21:31.917 --> 21:33.794
Yeah. We don't even fucking know
this guy.

21:33.836 --> 21:37.506
-Dude, it's Penka's son. C'mon.
-I know.

21:37.548 --> 21:38.841
-Deb.
-SASCHA: Tea time.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.385
Have you ever felt like you were
being guided by something,

21:41.426 --> 21:43.804
like, you just knew that
something was the right thing?

21:43.846 --> 21:45.180
-What?
-Can you please try

21:45.222 --> 21:48.559
to just trust me,
just a little bit, please?

21:48.600 --> 21:49.560
(GROANS)

21:49.601 --> 21:52.229
Besides, Penka had very rough
hands. You didn't like that.

21:52.271 --> 21:55.357
-You're manipulative as fuck.
-That kettle boils water fast.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.401
I'm not manipulating.
I'm just saying that...

21:57.442 --> 21:59.987
-Mmm.
-Oh, there's your tea.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.406
Thank you.

22:02.447 --> 22:06.743
After you finish, I'd like
to show you some yoni stretches.

(VOICES ON TV)

22:10.789 --> 22:12.249

from people touching me.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.923

22:19.965 --> 22:21.717
Yeah. I'm fucking pregnant,

22:21.758 --> 22:23.719
The only thing art openings
are good for

22:23.760 --> 22:25.512
is wine
and unpasteurized cheeses.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.890
OK, well,
I'll tell Simon you were tired.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.350
-Simon'll be fine.
-OK. Bye, babe.

-Bye.
-Bye, Sascha.

Bye.

-No, nope. Nope.
-Where are you going?

-Snack attack.
-Let me get that for you.

what I want?

28:00.764 --> 28:03.934
I don't know.
It's raining. Like...

28:03.976 --> 28:06.061
What? Don't be a pussy, Peg.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.396
-She's scared.
-Hey, language!

28:07.437 --> 28:09.565
They're scared
because of last time.

28:09.606 --> 28:12.734
Get on the court.
I've missed you.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.111
Jan.

28:15.779 --> 28:17.114
Watch your ass, bitch!

28:17.155 --> 28:18.448
(GRUNTING)

28:18.490 --> 28:20.075
-Nice.
-Shit!

28:21.827 --> 28:23.829
(SCREAMS)

28:23.871 --> 28:25.205
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.459
(CHEERING)

28:29.501 --> 28:31.753
-Baby!
-Ha!

28:37.217 --> 28:40.012
-Go for it, babe.
-Rebound, rebound, Katherine.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.221
Here.

28:41.972 --> 28:43.724
Aran, take it up!

28:44.975 --> 28:46.810
Oh, c'mon.

28:46.852 --> 28:49.229
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

28:52.691 --> 28:56.195
All right, listen.
Forget this. Eyes up here.

28:56.236 --> 28:59.031
-Bank right, bank right!
-Not in my house.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.325
-Shit!
-(ALL GASP)

29:01.366 --> 29:02.743
-Yeah.
-Shit.

29:02.784 --> 29:03.827
I'm good. (GROANS)

29:03.869 --> 29:05.537
SASCHA: Everybody,
give her some space.

29:05.579 --> 29:07.164
Give her some space.
Deb, you OK?

29:07.206 --> 29:09.374
-Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
-Where does it hurt?

29:09.416 --> 29:12.836
Uh... It's just my lower back
and my old hip.

29:12.878 --> 29:15.130
OK. I hit the ground
pretty hard.

29:15.172 --> 29:18.008
-Anybody got any ice?
-I'm fine, OK?

29:18.050 --> 29:19.468
It's par for the court, my dude.

29:19.510 --> 29:21.720
All right, just sit there.
Do not move.

29:21.762 --> 29:23.180
Peg, go get some ice, girl.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.516
-Do I get the foul on that?
-I don't have ice.

29:25.557 --> 29:26.433
Katherine.

29:26.475 --> 29:27.518
PEG:
Use a bag with a cold apple.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.186
-KATHERINE: You get the foul.
-I'm good.

29:29.228 --> 29:31.605
Guys, I'll be good to go
in five. It's fine.

29:31.647 --> 29:34.650
Nah, I gotta split.
I gotta do laundry.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.902
Gotta pick up the kids,
early dismissal.

29:36.944 --> 29:40.197
Good game, though. Really good
playing and shooting.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.366
Yeah, Mamma's, putting you
on the bench

29:42.407 --> 29:44.284
for a while, babe. Sorry.

29:46.036 --> 29:48.163
SASCHA: I'll play.

29:48.205 --> 29:50.499
It's raining, though.

29:53.293 --> 29:55.796
I don't know why
everybody had to take off.

29:55.838 --> 29:59.633
-Peg had to do laundry.
-Yeah, I heard her say that.

30:00.759 --> 30:03.470
-(HORN BLARES)
-Fuck!

30:03.512 --> 30:06.765
God, sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

30:06.807 --> 30:08.308
(HORN BLARES)

30:08.350 --> 30:09.643
Come on!

30:09.685 --> 30:12.479
(HORN CONTINUES)

30:16.608 --> 30:18.777
It's the hormones, man.
I'm sorry.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.195
It's OK.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.575
(GROANS)

30:24.616 --> 30:27.703
-You want me to drive?
-No, I just...

30:27.744 --> 30:29.663
I can't play.

30:31.290 --> 30:35.878
-You like basketball.
-Yeah, ball is life,

30:35.919 --> 30:40.841
and that's apparently over now
because I'm... a blimp.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.469
You could be the blimp
at the game

30:44.511 --> 30:47.264
instead of one of
the players, you know?

30:48.056 --> 30:50.184
Just floating over.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.645
Was that supposed
to make me feel better?

30:53.687 --> 30:54.730
Yes.

30:54.771 --> 30:57.357
So, yeah, you know,
I like dog babies,

30:57.399 --> 30:58.859
but I liked
human babies more.

30:58.901 --> 31:01.153
And that's kinda where I settled
and ended up here.

31:01.195 --> 31:04.156
Everything else is looking good.
Do you wanna know the sex?

31:04.823 --> 31:06.325
Um...

31:07.367 --> 31:09.244
Yeah.

31:09.286 --> 31:11.997
Fuck it. What are we working
with? Poker or fireplace?

31:13.332 --> 31:15.667
-Huh?
-Like a poker.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.087
(LAUGHS)

31:20.756 --> 31:23.175
Strange joke.

31:23.217 --> 31:24.718
-Thanks.
-DOCTOR: Um...

31:24.760 --> 31:27.304
Yeah, things are a little turned
around here.

31:27.346 --> 31:29.181
So let's see if we can get
some movement.

31:29.223 --> 31:31.183
(WHISPERS) Hello, baby, come on.

31:31.225 --> 31:34.645
Come on. Sprinkle a little dust.

31:36.063 --> 31:37.606
Come on.

31:37.648 --> 31:40.108
Oh! See? There we are.
Right there.

31:40.150 --> 31:43.904
You have
a very distinctive, um...

31:43.946 --> 31:45.447
A dick?

31:45.489 --> 31:49.493
Uh, yes.
You're gonna have a boy.

31:49.535 --> 31:52.162
-(LAUGHS)
-What?

31:53.497 --> 31:54.706
SASCHA: Congrats.

31:55.707 --> 31:58.168
DOCTOR: Uh... so, yeah, I...

31:58.210 --> 32:03.715
I know there's some talk
about having this baby at home,

32:03.757 --> 32:04.883
which, hey, that's fine.

32:04.925 --> 32:08.136
I just wanted to talk about
the risks, given that you're...

32:08.178 --> 32:10.848
-Old as fuck?
-No, no. You're in great shape.

32:10.889 --> 32:12.975
It's just we should talk about,
um...

32:13.016 --> 32:14.601
there is a risk
of complications.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.353
-DEB: Right.
-We should talk about it.

32:16.395 --> 32:18.230
No, I do remember this
from last time.

32:18.272 --> 32:21.191
It's just that my partner Silvio
doesn't...

32:21.233 --> 32:24.278
-He's... No, um...
-Hm-hmm.

32:24.319 --> 32:27.239
I just need more time to make
a decision. Is that cool?

32:27.281 --> 32:29.074
DOCTOR: That's cool.
Whatever is cool.

32:29.116 --> 32:31.785
You're cool. Everybody's cool.
Yes, take your time.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.954
We can talk about it
next time you come in.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.414
OK. Thank you.

32:35.455 --> 32:37.082
All right. Have a great day,
you two.

32:37.124 --> 32:40.460
-OK. Thank you, Dr. Zonkowski.
-Be blessed. See ya. Bye.

32:42.045 --> 32:44.590
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
I'll meet you outside.

32:44.631 --> 32:45.966
OK.

32:49.553 --> 32:51.305
(SIGHS)

32:56.768 --> 32:59.438
-(KNOCKING)
-Hey, Dr. Gregory Zonkowski?

32:59.479 --> 33:00.814
Yes, sir.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.316
SASCHA:
Yeah, sorry to bother you.

33:02.357 --> 33:04.318
I just have a quick question.

33:04.359 --> 33:07.321
Yeah, OK. No prob.
What's going on?

33:07.362 --> 33:09.489
What's your C-section rate?

33:13.869 --> 33:16.872
You look familiar. Where you
in the room with, uh, Debbie?

33:16.914 --> 33:19.708
-Deb.
-Deb, yeah.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.043
And you are? Who are you again?

33:21.084 --> 33:23.378
-Are you Dad?
-I'm the doula.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.423
The doula.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.009
Yeah, OK.

33:30.427 --> 33:33.096
Don't get me wrong.
You say that you're a doula.

33:33.138 --> 33:36.892
And I can respect that. Um...

33:36.934 --> 33:40.395
-But in all honesty, we don't...
-What's your rate, though?

33:41.355 --> 33:42.940
There are no numbers on that

33:42.981 --> 33:44.900
and we see this
more and more now.

33:44.942 --> 33:47.819
Not to be rude, if you
really want to advocate for her,

33:47.861 --> 33:49.738
you should tell her
to have the baby here.

33:49.780 --> 33:51.448
Are you a cutter?

33:51.490 --> 33:54.409
-I don't know who you...
-What's the cut-off time?

33:54.451 --> 33:56.453
-The cut-off time?
-Eight hours?

33:56.995 --> 33:58.121
Seven?

33:58.163 --> 33:59.331
-Hi.
-Hey.

33:59.373 --> 34:01.875
-What's up? Ready.
-Yeah, so am I.

34:03.418 --> 34:04.711
Hi.

34:09.842 --> 34:12.594
-SASCHA: Where's Silvio today?
-DEB: Uh, he had a meeting.

34:12.636 --> 34:14.388
SASCHA:
Was he excited about this baby?

34:14.429 --> 34:16.264
-DEB: Yeah.
-SASCHA: And you?

34:16.306 --> 34:17.724
DEB: Um, yeah.

34:17.766 --> 34:22.521
I mean, it's a lot. We weren't
together very long before we...

34:22.563 --> 34:24.356
-Before I...
-How long?

34:24.398 --> 34:25.607
Three weeks.

34:25.649 --> 34:28.944
-I know. It's Wack City, right?
-I don't know about Wack City,

34:28.985 --> 34:30.862
but judging from the way
you play basketball,

34:30.904 --> 34:33.532
I think you might have
borderline personality disorder.

34:33.574 --> 34:34.783
Excuse me? Yo.

34:34.824 --> 34:37.703
Silvio didn't ask me
before hiring you.

34:37.744 --> 34:39.871
-Did you know that?
-I did not.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.541
Yeah, so I don't know
what you were talking about

34:42.583 --> 34:43.583
with the doctor in there.

34:43.625 --> 34:46.170
But if you could, like,
not do that.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.214
-Do what?
-Like, have conversations...

34:49.255 --> 34:52.176
(WHISPERS) ...about my pregnancy
without me being in the room.

34:52.217 --> 34:55.679
-Of course.
-Because it's just...

34:55.721 --> 34:57.264
-No, I get it.
-...not a cool thing.

34:57.306 --> 34:59.558
Just so you know, I wasn't.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.102
Really? What were you
talking to him about then?

35:02.144 --> 35:04.646
I thought he might've been
the brother of someone

35:04.688 --> 35:06.940
I went to midwifery school with.

35:09.151 --> 35:12.821
Do you know what the word doula
literally translates to?

35:12.863 --> 35:14.031
Haven't we covered this?

35:14.072 --> 35:15.824
The one who speaks
for the woman

35:15.866 --> 35:19.328
when her teeth
are gritted in pain.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.622
I thought that you said
it was like a helper slave.

35:21.663 --> 35:25.375
Deb, the moment you don't
need me anymore, I will vanish.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.377
I don't make plans without you.

35:29.046 --> 35:31.465
If I say that I want
a hospital birth

35:31.507 --> 35:34.676
with a motherfucking epidural?

35:34.718 --> 35:38.430
-Great. Bring on the drugs.
-Seriously?

35:38.472 --> 35:41.350
Deb, who's having this baby?
Is Silvio having this baby?

35:41.391 --> 35:43.435
Is the doctor with hairy arms
having the baby?

35:43.477 --> 35:44.436
Oh, my God!

35:44.478 --> 35:46.605
-You noticed that too?
-Yes.

35:52.528 --> 35:54.863
WOMAN: And now...

35:58.909 --> 36:03.580
WOMAN: Imagine now a great crack
in the bottom of this sea

36:03.622 --> 36:09.127
leading farther down to an even
more unfathomable depth.

36:09.169 --> 36:13.715
Place yourself there
in this crack.

36:13.757 --> 36:19.054
Imagine that your human body
has dissolved into the crack,

36:19.096 --> 36:22.140
that you are one with the void.

36:22.182 --> 36:23.392
-Know that this place...
-Yo!

36:23.433 --> 36:25.018
...is the place
of all becoming.

36:25.060 --> 36:25.978

-...where Gaia first...

bougie spread going on here?

on the birth plan, babe.

36:35.821 --> 36:38.448
Great. Those look good.

36:38.490 --> 36:40.659
-Have some.
-Oh, thanks.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.703

36:42.744 --> 36:46.790
(CLEARS THROAT) Mmm.

36:46.832 --> 36:48.542
Are these pasteurized cheeses,
baby?

36:50.878 --> 36:51.962
No.

36:52.004 --> 36:52.963
No?

36:53.005 --> 36:55.966
SASCHA: The whole
pasteurized cheese thing...

36:56.008 --> 36:57.384
-It's a myth.
-SILVIO: Really?

36:57.426 --> 36:59.219
-Is it?
-SASCHA: Hm-hmm.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.140
-Gotta hit the head.
-Hm.

37:03.182 --> 37:04.808
That's funny.
I didn't know that.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.268
SASCHA: Yup.

37:11.565 --> 37:14.067
-How was the doctor?
-Good.

37:14.109 --> 37:15.402
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:15.444 --> 37:17.905
-What?
-Nothing.

37:18.739 --> 37:21.909
-Hmm?
-It's just...

37:21.950 --> 37:23.577
That doctor...

37:23.619 --> 37:25.329
Deb likes him, doesn't she?
What about him?

37:25.370 --> 37:27.789
Yeah, and that's fine.
Ultimately, it's her birth.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.709
Right, but what's your
impression of him? Is he bad?

37:30.751 --> 37:32.628
-I wouldn't say bad.
-What would you say?

37:32.669 --> 37:36.173
I'm just worried he might be
a little... scalpel-happy,

37:36.215 --> 37:37.049
if you know what I mean.

37:37.090 --> 37:39.134

What's his caesarean rate?

37:39.176 --> 37:41.970
Couldn't get him to tell me, but
we're gonna keep an eye on it.

37:42.012 --> 37:44.473
-Jesus!
-don't mention anything to Deb.

37:44.515 --> 37:48.101
No, I won't. It's just, I want
her to do the right thing.

37:48.143 --> 37:50.312
Don't worry about it.
I'm looking after her.

-That's not pee.
-Yeah, that's not pee, baby.

38:46.034 --> 38:47.619
What's a doula?

38:47.661 --> 38:50.205
Oh, well, a doula,
the literal translation...

38:50.247 --> 38:53.292
-Who are you talking to?
-Oh, Deb. Come here, it's Will.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.378
Hey, Will, this is Deb.

38:56.420 --> 38:57.588
Come on.

39:02.092 --> 39:03.468
-WILL: Hi.
-Hi.

39:03.510 --> 39:06.972
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too, Will.

39:07.014 --> 39:10.142
Am I gonna have a little sister
or a little brother?

39:10.184 --> 39:12.936
They don't know.
It's gonna be a surprise.

39:12.978 --> 39:14.354
Well, cool.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.610
Uh, Will, did you get
the basketball that I sent?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.988
-Oh, yeah.
-Great.

39:23.030 --> 39:24.907
Have you... Did you try it out?

39:24.948 --> 39:27.367
-Yeah, it's big.
-Yeah, well, it's full size.

39:27.409 --> 39:29.536
That's my idea. If you learn
to play on that one,

39:29.578 --> 39:30.704
by the time your hands grow,

39:30.746 --> 39:32.664
you're gonna be playing
like James Harden.

39:32.706 --> 39:34.208
It's all about ball control.

39:34.249 --> 39:36.835
My uncle says
James Harden is a nihilist.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.631
Your uncle's a wise man.

39:41.924 --> 39:43.800
Uh, well, we should
play together.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.969
You know,
when I'm not so pregnant.

39:46.011 --> 39:48.639
Oh. Will the new house
have a hoop?

39:49.765 --> 39:51.266
The new house?

39:51.308 --> 39:54.269
I cannot believe that you are
trying to justify this now.

39:54.311 --> 39:57.022
You are so out of touch, my man.

39:57.064 --> 39:59.316
God, first the doula, now this?

39:59.358 --> 40:01.860
No. Look, I'm just trying to do
the right thing by my kid, Deb.

40:01.902 --> 40:02.819
His mother is a nightmare.

40:02.861 --> 40:04.863
His mother told you
to take him.

40:04.905 --> 40:07.908
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

40:07.950 --> 40:11.662
DEB: She said, "Jump,"
and you said, "How high?"

40:11.703 --> 40:14.039
SILVIO: That is not
what happened.

40:14.081 --> 40:16.583
I promise
I will make this up to you.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.544
How? (LAUGHS)

40:18.585 --> 40:19.753
Look, I'm just doing that thing

40:19.795 --> 40:22.714
where I wanna
take care of everyone, you know?

40:22.756 --> 40:24.424
-(GROANS)
-I just...

40:25.133 --> 40:26.927
Will you let me try?

40:26.969 --> 40:30.097
Let me try.
I promise I won't let you down.

40:33.433 --> 40:34.560
Bro.

40:34.601 --> 40:37.896
Swirling, no longer a maiden.

40:37.938 --> 40:41.567
And feel the sway right there,
just the sway.

40:41.608 --> 40:44.027
And one, two, three, push up.

40:44.069 --> 40:48.156
Kick away your old self.
It's not about you anymore.

40:48.198 --> 40:50.742
That is your old life.
That is your maiden self.

40:50.784 --> 40:55.289
You're pushing her away
to welcome in the mother.

40:55.330 --> 40:58.584
Breathe in. Breathe out,
breathe in, breathe out.

41:00.002 --> 41:03.797
Breathe in. (GRUNTS)
Breathe out.

41:04.965 --> 41:09.803
So today... it was about work.

41:09.845 --> 41:15.851
Because it is work
to bring a baby into the world.

41:15.893 --> 41:17.436
Or babies.

41:17.477 --> 41:19.730
Sometimes it's twice the work.
I have twins.

41:19.771 --> 41:23.358
Breathe in. (LAUGHS)
Breathe out.

41:23.400 --> 41:28.030
But mammas are strong
and mammas are capable.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.950
And that's why today
for closing words...

41:33.202 --> 41:36.872
I wanna ask everyone
what do you think

41:36.914 --> 41:40.209
will take a little bit of work

41:40.250 --> 41:43.670
to bring these babies
into this world?

41:49.051 --> 41:50.302
Chelsea.

41:50.344 --> 41:54.264
I'm just a little concerned
about the... the pooping part.

41:54.306 --> 41:57.976
My cousin Claire,
just... all over.

41:59.895 --> 42:04.316
Well, I'm scared about, um...
after it's here.

42:04.358 --> 42:07.027
Perineum tear.

42:07.069 --> 42:09.321
I'm really, really, really
scared about it,

42:09.363 --> 42:13.784
and I really wanna
have this baby naturally.

42:14.493 --> 42:16.954
So I'm just gonna...

42:16.995 --> 42:21.750
get really strong down there
and...

42:21.792 --> 42:25.003
-and really flexible.
-TUTOR: Yes!

42:25.045 --> 42:27.130
So brave.

42:29.967 --> 42:33.345
-Deb.
-Me?

42:33.387 --> 42:35.347
How are you, dear Deb?

42:35.389 --> 42:38.392
I'm... good, dear Gracie.

42:38.433 --> 42:41.562
So what's gonna take
a little hard work on your end?

42:41.603 --> 42:42.813
Uh...

42:42.855 --> 42:46.400
Shit. Um, gosh, I...

42:47.860 --> 42:50.320
I really hate this part.
Can I just skip?

42:50.362 --> 42:52.573
You can't skip.

42:52.614 --> 42:56.451
-What? Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

42:56.493 --> 43:00.330
-Where is that written?
-Oh, it's not written anywhere.

43:00.372 --> 43:02.457
We're a circle of mammas.

43:02.499 --> 43:03.917
So we, you know,

43:03.959 --> 43:07.087
we didn't actually get any pens
and write it down.

43:07.129 --> 43:09.381
We don't have any rules
that we wrote.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.216
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm gonna skip.

43:11.258 --> 43:13.260
You can't skip things!

43:15.596 --> 43:17.973
It can't be skipped.

43:19.224 --> 43:21.351
You can't skip.

43:26.064 --> 43:30.402
Uh. (EXHALES) My...

43:30.444 --> 43:33.155
My boyfriend's kid
is moving in with us

43:33.197 --> 43:35.407
and that's not inherently
a bad thing.

43:35.449 --> 43:37.743
He seems like
a really sweet kid,

43:37.784 --> 43:41.747
but I'm just
a little bit worried that the...

43:41.788 --> 43:47.419
the baby is gonna be...
lost in all of this.

43:50.380 --> 43:52.841
Actually that, that's, um...
that's not true.

43:52.883 --> 43:55.093
I'm not worried that the baby's
gonna be forgotten.

43:55.135 --> 43:59.890
I'm just worried that I'm
going to be... forgotten.

44:01.850 --> 44:04.520
You know, Silvio has got me
knocked up and now what am I?

44:04.561 --> 44:07.940
I'm just like a...
I'm a hostage in my own body.

44:07.981 --> 44:10.317
I'm a goddamn delivery vessel.

44:12.986 --> 44:17.491
But, uh, I've got Sasch,
you know, my doula.

44:17.533 --> 44:19.159
So that's chill.

44:19.952 --> 44:21.745
Smells a little musty.

44:21.787 --> 44:26.500
But whatever, there. I shared.

44:27.209 --> 44:28.335
(SNIFFS)

44:30.587 --> 44:32.923
(CHOPPING)

45:21.930 --> 45:23.098
That's what I want to do.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.058
Call it what it is, all right?
A pussy.

45:25.100 --> 45:27.519
OK. Well, the doctors
are gonna love that.

45:27.561 --> 45:30.147
(LAUGHS) Yeah, well, don't you
worry about Dr. Zonkowski.

45:30.189 --> 45:31.982
I'll take care of him.

45:39.781 --> 45:41.867
And I'm so excited to use those.
They're robot boobs.

45:41.909 --> 45:43.535
I don't want robot boobs.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.662
-OK, I'll put 'em down.
-It's from me.

45:45.704 --> 45:47.623
Oh, the grinder.
Now I can cultivate

45:47.664 --> 45:49.708
those German
field worker forearms.

45:49.750 --> 45:52.252
This is how we grind ze food
for ze baby.

45:52.294 --> 45:54.922
This is how you grind
ze baby into ze food.

45:54.963 --> 45:57.674
-Ja!
-Grind the baby and eat it.

45:57.716 --> 46:00.344
-That's great.
-It's for food for the baby.

46:00.385 --> 46:02.763
It's to make baby food.

46:06.767 --> 46:10.229
Totally. Thank you, Naureen.
Thank you. That's really sweet.

46:10.270 --> 46:12.940
-Here, let's do this one.
-DEB: Thank you.

46:12.981 --> 46:15.359
Wow. Well, save best for last.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.818
-It's from...
-SILVIO: Yup.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.530
So, "To baby, from Dad Silvio."

46:19.571 --> 46:22.866
-Dad Silvio, that's me.
-DEB: From Daddio Silvio.

46:22.908 --> 46:27.204
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Daddy...

46:28.372 --> 46:31.834
OK, ready?

46:31.875 --> 46:33.502
-SILVIO: Oh, let's flip it.
-Oh.

46:33.544 --> 46:35.045
SILVIO:
So that people can see it.

46:35.087 --> 46:35.838
Oh, wow.

46:35.879 --> 46:38.715
-♪ Ta-da!
-Wow.

46:38.757 --> 46:41.969
Wait. I don't get it.

46:42.010 --> 46:44.680
(SIGHS) It's gender
non-conforming, dummy.

46:44.721 --> 46:46.223
Right, 'cause we don't know
the sex.

46:46.265 --> 46:47.808
-SILVIO: Yeah, yeah.
-NAUREEN: Aw.

46:47.850 --> 46:49.643
SILVIO: We can put that
in the nursery, or...

46:49.685 --> 46:51.979
It's beautiful, boo.
That's really nice.

46:52.020 --> 46:57.276
OK. Guys? OK,
now the last gift is coming out.

46:57.317 --> 46:59.528
-SILVIO: Arriving...
-Wow, more.

46:59.570 --> 47:01.613
-Just about.
-There's more.

47:01.655 --> 47:03.282
Actually coming out right now.

47:04.408 --> 47:06.201
Just gotta...

47:06.243 --> 47:08.203
Backing it up.

47:08.996 --> 47:10.038
All right.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.374
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're good.
You're good. You're good.

47:14.126 --> 47:16.128
No, it's all good.
It's all good.

47:16.170 --> 47:18.589
Yay, and drum roll.
(MIMICS DRUMROLL)

47:18.630 --> 47:20.424
DEB: Oh, my God!

47:20.465 --> 47:22.885
-SILVIO: Oh!
-DEB: Wow!

47:22.926 --> 47:26.597
Home birth tub! (CHUCKLES)

47:26.638 --> 47:30.767
-Wow. My gosh.
-All for you, babe.

47:30.809 --> 47:33.145
DEB: Yo, where are we
gonna put this?

47:33.187 --> 47:34.646
Right here.

47:34.688 --> 47:37.357
OK, but we... I still haven't
decided if I wanna do that.

47:37.399 --> 47:39.943
This is just in case you do
decide to do a home birth.

47:39.985 --> 47:42.779
And then... but if you don't,
then we can just return it.

47:42.821 --> 47:47.951
Um, actually it says
it's non-returnable up here.

47:47.993 --> 47:49.661
-SILVIO: Does... does it?
-Hm-hmm.

47:49.703 --> 47:50.704
Big words and everything.

47:50.746 --> 47:52.247
Oh, well,
I'll take a look at that.

47:52.289 --> 47:55.626
But, yeah, so I mean,
it's just... (CHUCKLES)

47:55.667 --> 47:57.503
If you don't wanna use it,
you don't have to. It's just...

47:57.544 --> 47:59.880
-I'll take it.
-Yeah, we'll take it.

47:59.922 --> 48:01.840
I'll take it.

48:01.882 --> 48:06.386
-(GASPS) Katherine. Oh, my God.
-What? I'm off duty. Chill.

48:06.428 --> 48:09.056
Yo, I've never seen you
smoke weed before.

48:09.097 --> 48:10.474
Good shit.

48:10.516 --> 48:12.601
That is one thing
that I really miss.

48:12.643 --> 48:14.436
Yeah, I miss you smoking weed
too, bitch.

48:14.478 --> 48:16.480
Shut up. Rude.

48:16.522 --> 48:17.856
You can smoke if you want.

48:17.898 --> 48:19.441
-Don't tell her that.
-What?

48:19.483 --> 48:22.361
What? Seriously. You don't share
lungs with your baby.

48:22.402 --> 48:23.987
Yeah,
but the intoxication factor.

48:24.029 --> 48:25.989
It's no different
than a couple glasses of wine.

48:26.031 --> 48:27.824
-Really?
-Really.

48:27.866 --> 48:29.535
Yo, let me see that.

48:30.452 --> 48:32.663
-Hey, babe.
-Hey!

48:33.580 --> 48:36.667
-What's up?
-Nothing.

48:36.708 --> 48:39.169
We got the, uh, tub filled up.
Do you wanna come check it out?

48:39.211 --> 48:41.880
-Oh, sure.
-Cool.

48:41.922 --> 48:43.423
Come on. Sascha, you wanna come?

48:43.465 --> 48:47.135
No, I'm good. You can send me
a video, baby day.

48:47.177 --> 48:49.054
-Go for it.
-(CHUCKLES)

48:50.806 --> 48:53.642
-I'll be back.
-Later, skater.

48:56.103 --> 48:58.272
So, what's with all the green?

48:58.313 --> 48:59.439
(LAUGHTER)

48:59.481 --> 49:03.026
That's interesting.
I've never met one of you.

49:03.068 --> 49:06.113
-Wait, the reality show winner?
-Yes.

49:06.154 --> 49:08.907
-Not for nothing. Good riddance.
-Shut up.

49:08.949 --> 49:10.284
She loved her.

49:10.325 --> 49:12.828
-She doesn't know what love is.
-Do any of us really know?

49:12.870 --> 49:15.789
Well, love is not
eight parking tickets.

49:15.831 --> 49:16.832
(LAUGHTER)

49:16.874 --> 49:19.001
Dude, love is not
eight parking tickets.

49:19.042 --> 49:20.878
And how long
did she have your car?

49:20.919 --> 49:22.588
-Four days.
-Four days!

49:22.629 --> 49:25.132
-Eight tickets in four days!
-Get out of my... Shut up!

49:25.174 --> 49:27.718
Hey, wait. How'd you find out?
How did you find out?

49:27.759 --> 49:29.720
I got the motherfucking boot.

49:29.761 --> 49:30.846
(LAUGHTER)

49:30.888 --> 49:32.723
You bitches laugh.

49:32.764 --> 49:36.476
OK. Fine. It's terrible.
It's sad.

49:36.518 --> 49:38.061
Never telling you anything
ever again.

49:38.103 --> 49:42.024
Oh, my gosh, you guys are
killing me! Like, the parking.

49:42.065 --> 49:43.525
Like, all these parking tickets,
right?

49:43.567 --> 49:45.736
They're supposed
to pay for things.

49:45.777 --> 49:48.405
And, like, if we don't pay them,
then what will happen?

49:48.447 --> 49:50.407
Like, there'll be
no new paved roads

49:50.449 --> 49:53.160
and then the rats
will come at night.

49:53.202 --> 49:56.330
They'll all be like... (JUDDERS)
all over the place at night.

49:56.371 --> 49:58.207
And then they'll come
during the day

49:58.248 --> 50:00.626
and then it'll just be, like,
rats all the time.

50:00.667 --> 50:02.544
Taken over by the rats.

50:02.586 --> 50:04.671
(LAUGHS)

50:09.009 --> 50:10.385
-Hey, Deb.
-Yeah.

50:10.427 --> 50:14.723
You wanna be our surr
the next time around?

50:14.765 --> 50:16.350
-Surr?
-What was that?

50:16.391 --> 50:18.977
It's a surrogate.
Say the whole word.

50:19.019 --> 50:20.771
What? I like the abbreviation.

1:02:20.699 --> 1:02:23.702
Great.
That is super fucking mature.

1:02:23.744 --> 1:02:25.287
OK, you guys wanna drink wine

1:02:25.329 --> 1:02:27.789
and smoke weed
and do God knows what else?

1:02:27.831 --> 1:02:30.334
Then go ahead, fine. Whatever.
It's no big deal.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:31.793
It's just my fucking child, Deb.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:33.378
DEB: I'm sorry,
God knows what else?

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:34.588
What are you talking about?

1:02:34.630 --> 1:02:37.299
You are the person
that forced this.

1:02:37.341 --> 1:02:40.719
I thought it would be...
alternative prenatal care.

1:02:40.761 --> 1:02:43.514
-It is!
-Not this radical hippie shit.

1:02:43.555 --> 1:02:45.474
-SASCHA: I'll go, Deb.
-Which is frankly insane.

1:02:45.516 --> 1:02:47.976
-Not a big deal.
-You are not going anywhere.

1:02:48.018 --> 1:02:49.311
Did you know that he got a blow

1:02:49.353 --> 1:02:51.313
from Katherine
at the baby shower?

1:02:52.189 --> 1:02:54.024
(LAUGHS)

1:02:55.234 --> 1:02:57.236
-Wait, really?
-And then some.

1:02:57.277 --> 1:03:00.239
(LAUGHS) OK. Wow, OK.

1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:02.157
Um...

1:03:02.199 --> 1:03:05.035
Yeah, sorry.
So that's what the problem is?

1:03:05.077 --> 1:03:06.745
-So what?
-So what?

1:03:06.787 --> 1:03:08.622
So you're OK
with that behavior?

1:03:08.664 --> 1:03:10.374
With getting blowjobs?

1:03:10.415 --> 1:03:12.626
Yeah, so long
as he's not blowing my baby,

1:03:12.668 --> 1:03:14.419
I'm pretty sure
I'm cool with it.

1:03:14.461 --> 1:03:15.629
-Wow!
-He's a doula.

1:03:15.671 --> 1:03:17.005
-Wow.
-Not the Pope.

1:03:17.047 --> 1:03:18.841
Yeah, I know he's not the Pope.

1:03:18.882 --> 1:03:21.468
I'll have that image
in my mind forever.

1:03:21.510 --> 1:03:25.639
Do I not have a right
to feel pleasure, Silvio?

1:03:25.681 --> 1:03:28.016
Do I not have the right to heal?

1:03:28.058 --> 1:03:29.685
Perhaps if you weren't
so dead set

1:03:29.726 --> 1:03:31.436
on denying pleasure
to yourself,

1:03:31.478 --> 1:03:33.564
you wouldn't so harshly
judge those of us

1:03:33.605 --> 1:03:35.107
who allow ourselves to feel it.

1:03:35.148 --> 1:03:38.986
Yeah. Blah, blah.
Psychology, psychology.

1:03:39.027 --> 1:03:40.654
Yeah, walk away.

1:03:40.696 --> 1:03:43.198
DEB: God, you are being
such a fucking baby right now.

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:46.034
Be that as it may,
it is him or me, baby.

1:03:46.076 --> 1:03:47.369
I'm sorry, what?

1:03:47.411 --> 1:03:50.831
-That is totally unfair.
-I don't care.

1:03:56.336 --> 1:03:57.671
I have...

1:03:59.590 --> 1:04:01.925
I didn't even wanna have
this baby in the first place.

1:04:01.967 --> 1:04:03.760
-Deb.
-No. I let you talk me into it

1:04:03.802 --> 1:04:06.346
with all your fucking bullshit
about geriatric pregnancies

1:04:06.388 --> 1:04:08.015
-and this and that.
-Deb, Deb.

1:04:08.056 --> 1:04:10.601
You were the one who said that
I was getting past my prime,

1:04:10.642 --> 1:04:12.394
that I was getting
a bit long in the tooth.

1:04:12.436 --> 1:04:13.896
Oh, come on now.
That was a joke.

1:04:13.937 --> 1:04:16.190
Well, it fucking hurt! OK?

1:04:16.231 --> 1:04:18.233
I still have a life
that I wanna live.

1:04:18.275 --> 1:04:20.944
I still have things I wanna do
in this world, you asshole.

1:04:20.986 --> 1:04:23.197
I had a basketball career!

1:04:23.238 --> 1:04:27.826
No, you make fun of that,
but that means something to me.

1:04:27.868 --> 1:04:29.536
So you wanna do this
all over again,

1:04:29.578 --> 1:04:30.746
you wanna have another baby,

1:04:30.787 --> 1:04:33.415
but you wanna do it
on your terms this time.

1:04:33.457 --> 1:04:35.375
But at whose expense?
At my expense.

1:04:35.417 --> 1:04:37.711
Everything is at my expense!

1:04:37.753 --> 1:04:41.465
And so now you won't even let me
keep my doula that you hired.

1:04:43.175 --> 1:04:45.511
That I love anyways
despite his body odor

1:04:45.552 --> 1:04:49.097
and his borderline
inappropriate sexual dalliances

1:04:49.139 --> 1:04:50.891
with my best friend.

1:04:53.268 --> 1:04:58.148
This is so not cool, man.
You cannot make me choose.

1:05:10.827 --> 1:05:12.538

I'm sorry.

1:05:12.579 --> 1:05:13.705
DEB: Oh, thanks!

1:05:25.717 --> 1:05:28.345
-I know you like green.
-Thank you.

1:05:49.533 --> 1:05:51.743
I just wanna say to both of you
that I'm really sorry.

1:05:51.785 --> 1:05:54.705
I think
I'm just a little stressed out.

1:05:54.746 --> 1:05:57.165
I have to get up
really early tomorrow.

1:05:57.207 --> 1:06:00.502
-For what?
-To pick up Will.

1:06:00.544 --> 1:06:04.214
-Oh, at the airport?
-No, in Taos.

1:06:06.216 --> 1:06:07.718
In Taos?

1:06:07.759 --> 1:06:10.179
Wait, were you driving? That's,
like, a thousand miles away.

1:06:10.220 --> 1:06:11.597
When are you gonna be back?

1:06:11.638 --> 1:06:14.433
Well, I mean,
you knew about it.

1:06:14.474 --> 1:06:16.476
Tomorrow's the first day
of my window.

1:06:16.518 --> 1:06:19.479
I did not know about
this.

1:06:19.521 --> 1:06:21.023
Yes, you did.
We talked about it.

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:24.484
You talked. You said, "Oh,
it's just the first day of..."

1:06:25.777 --> 1:06:26.987
I thought we talked about it.

1:06:27.029 --> 1:06:28.739
Oh, my God,
you're doing it again.

1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:31.325
-Doing what?
-You're fucking doing it again.

1:06:31.366 --> 1:06:32.326
Everything is cool.

1:06:32.367 --> 1:06:34.328
There's snowcones
and here you are,

1:06:34.369 --> 1:06:37.456
you are taking advantage of good
feelings to pull one over on me?

1:06:37.497 --> 1:06:39.499
No, I'm not doing that at all.

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:42.794
Don't lie.
Have some respect for yourself.

1:06:42.836 --> 1:06:45.547
Deb, OK.
We're talking about my son here.

1:06:45.589 --> 1:06:48.258
-He's my son.
-You know, this is your son.

1:06:49.551 --> 1:06:51.386
You mean you found out the sex
behind my back?

1:06:51.428 --> 1:06:53.347
Oh, my God, so what?

1:06:53.388 --> 1:06:54.765
Did you know
at the baby shower?

1:06:54.806 --> 1:06:58.060
The painting that I gave you?
That is so embarrassing.

1:06:58.101 --> 1:07:00.062
You really fucking suck, man.

1:07:00.103 --> 1:07:03.607
You know, you just cannot ever
make me the priority, can you?

1:07:03.649 --> 1:07:06.276
I cannot do this with you
anymore!

1:07:11.448 --> 1:07:14.159
(FIRE CRACKLES)

1:07:18.789 --> 1:07:22.626
We should burn some hair
or something. Toenails.

1:07:22.668 --> 1:07:24.837
Maybe do a Wiccan ritual.

1:07:24.878 --> 1:07:26.922
If I had the toenails
of my enemies,

1:07:26.964 --> 1:07:29.258
I would burn them
to make them suffer.

1:07:29.299 --> 1:07:32.678
Silvio probably left some
lying around.

1:07:32.719 --> 1:07:34.638
In fact, I know he did.

1:07:36.974 --> 1:07:39.810
-What's that wine taste like?
-Tastes like wine.

1:07:39.852 --> 1:07:42.729
Does it taste like getting raped
in the face by an oak branch?

1:07:42.771 --> 1:07:44.064
Based on the one time

1:07:44.106 --> 1:07:47.150
that happened to me,
yes, very similar.

1:07:47.818 --> 1:07:49.236
Gimme that.

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:54.741
Thank you.

1:07:56.535 --> 1:07:59.830
No, I don't want any looks or
attitude or judgment from you.

1:07:59.872 --> 1:08:01.206
KATHERINE:
I didn't say anything.

1:08:01.248 --> 1:08:03.458
I know you didn't say anything,
but I know you're thinking it

1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:04.877
and you're gonna
say something later.

1:08:04.918 --> 1:08:07.171
And all of the recent science
suggests

1:08:07.212 --> 1:08:09.381
that a little bit of alcohol
here and there

1:08:09.423 --> 1:08:11.758
does not harm the baby, OK?

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:13.135
And for Christ's sakes,

1:08:13.177 --> 1:08:16.930
my mom smoked and drank her way
through the entire pregnancy,

1:08:16.971 --> 1:08:19.099
and look at me. I'm fine, right?

1:08:19.892 --> 1:08:22.644
Yeah, if you say so.

1:08:22.685 --> 1:08:25.479
You gonna
give that back to me or...?

1:08:25.522 --> 1:08:26.899
Oh, no, this is mine now.

-Deb, is that you?
-DEB: Yeah.

is what that is.

-Are you OK, ma'am?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

all the time.

1:09:11.151 --> 1:09:14.363

your house, dear one.

Should we...

-Should she come inside?
-Yes.

if you mean Silvio, uh...

1:09:47.437 --> 1:09:50.064
Then I don't know.

to some art opening, I guess.

the magic of the rocks,

all three rocks
had to be together.

could the magic be used.

But when they were,

the red rock
could control people's actions.

could control people's emotions.

1:35:43.368 --> 1:35:45.370
Here, Silvio,
rub it, rub it, rub it.

1:35:45.412 --> 1:35:46.997
SILVIO: OK.

1:35:47.039 --> 1:35:49.374
(SASCHA LAUGHS) You did it, Deb.

1:35:49.416 --> 1:35:51.210

1:35:51.251 --> 1:35:53.003

-Ohh...
-(BABY CRIES)

1:35:55.506 --> 1:35:56.673
Deb.

1:36:02.763 --> 1:36:04.306
-GRACIE: Call an ambulance.
-What?

1:36:04.348 --> 1:36:07.559
GRACIE: Call an ambulance now.
Now! Now!

1:36:11.021 --> 1:36:12.773

1:36:13.982 --> 1:36:15.526
-GRACIE: Deb, I got you.
-SASCHA: Deb.

1:36:15.567 --> 1:36:16.860
GRACIE: I got you. Come on, Deb.

1:36:18.862 --> 1:36:20.906
MAN: The tree is a tree.

1:36:20.948 --> 1:36:22.616
(ECHOING) The tree is a tree.

1:36:28.372 --> 1:36:30.707
Rejoice in her now
in God's name.

1:36:42.094 --> 1:36:43.470
(SILVIO WHISPERS) Deb.

1:37:08.245 --> 1:37:09.663
SILVIO: Deb?

1:37:10.956 --> 1:37:13.250
-(GROANS SOFTLY)
-Are you waking up?

1:37:16.670 --> 1:37:18.505
(WEAKLY) Where's the baby?

1:37:18.547 --> 1:37:22.342
-What'd you say, honey?
-(WEAKLY) Where's my baby?

1:37:23.010 --> 1:37:24.678
She's right here.

1:37:28.891 --> 1:37:30.767
You... you want her?

1:37:31.935 --> 1:37:33.520
Did you say "she"?

1:37:35.230 --> 1:37:36.690
Uh-huh.

1:38:05.177 --> 1:38:07.054
(CAN OPENS)

1:38:09.306 --> 1:38:12.017
Stout helps the milk come in.

1:38:12.059 --> 1:38:13.977
Yeah, don't mind if I do.

1:38:14.686 --> 1:38:16.188
(DEB CHUCKLES)

1:38:17.397 --> 1:38:18.815
How you feeling?

1:38:20.150 --> 1:38:22.069
High as fuck.

1:38:22.110 --> 1:38:24.530
OK, well, maybe let's put
a pause on the stout.

1:38:24.571 --> 1:38:28.033
No. Rude.

1:38:38.836 --> 1:38:43.173
-I feel ashamed.
-What? Why?

1:38:43.215 --> 1:38:46.301
Because after all that,
I just ended up at the hospital.

1:38:47.845 --> 1:38:50.097
Oh, you just need someone
to blame.

1:38:50.138 --> 1:38:53.642
Let's get Dr. Zonkowski in here.
This is all his fault.

1:38:53.684 --> 1:38:55.519
SASCHA: Dr. Gregory Zonkowski.

1:38:55.561 --> 1:38:58.355
Excuse me, Nurse?
Can you get Dr. Zonkowski?

1:38:58.397 --> 1:39:00.065
We're having a reckoning in here

1:39:00.107 --> 1:39:03.777
and we're gonna need him
to blame, OK?

1:39:03.819 --> 1:39:05.904
That'll make you feel better.

1:39:05.946 --> 1:39:07.906
(GROANS) God.

1:39:09.157 --> 1:39:10.659
(EXHALES)

1:39:10.701 --> 1:39:13.537
That was... That was hard.

1:39:17.332 --> 1:39:19.251
That was the easy part.

1:39:23.797 --> 1:39:25.174
What is he talking about?

1:39:25.215 --> 1:39:27.176

1:39:39.438 --> 1:39:40.689
Gimme my beer.

1:40:25.776 --> 1:40:27.653
KATHERINE:
C'mon, give it all to me.

1:40:27.694 --> 1:40:29.821
I wanna be impregnated
right the fuck now.

1:40:29.863 --> 1:40:33.534
SASCHA: I serve at the pleasure
of my mistress!

1:40:33.575 --> 1:40:36.119

(KATHERINE LAUGHS)

1:40:43.585 --> 1:40:46.797
-Can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

1:40:46.839 --> 1:40:48.173
Is it actually OK for women

1:40:48.215 --> 1:40:50.425
to drink alcohol
during their pregnancy

1:40:50.467 --> 1:40:54.096
and, like, do all that shit,
like, eat ceviche and shit?

1:40:54.137 --> 1:40:55.305
'Cause I've been doing my...

1:40:55.347 --> 1:40:57.641
You know what doula
translates to?

1:40:57.683 --> 1:40:59.852
No, I don't know.

1:40:59.893 --> 1:41:02.938
The one who reminds you
that everyone is a free person

1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:05.816
and can do whatever they want.

1:41:05.858 --> 1:41:09.152
SASCHA: But that doesn't mean
that they should.

1:41:09.194 --> 1:41:12.114
KATHERINE:
Hmm, I didn't know that.

1:41:12.155 --> 1:41:13.740
SASCHA: Yeah.
