00:37.404 --> 00:38.894
Sick Bay to the Captain.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.496
This is the Doctor speaking.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.097
You've brought us out of stasis.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.369
l assume you have news.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.274
Yes.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.040
Our sensors show
your vital signs are normal.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.205
How are you feeling?

00:48.281 --> 00:50.715
We're fine.
How long were we in stasis?

00:50.784 --> 00:52.718
A total of 17 days.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.185
That long?

00:54.254 --> 00:57.052
l wanted to exhaust every
possibility of finding a cure.

00:57.123 --> 00:58.249
And?

00:58.324 --> 01:02.055
l regret to inform you
that l have been unsuccessful.

01:02.128 --> 01:05.655
l have not been able to develop
a counteragent for the virus,

01:05.732 --> 01:08.496
and l have no other options
to explore.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.799
What about keeping us
in stasis aboard Voyager?.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.566
Something
in the planet's environment

01:13.640 --> 01:15.904
is shielding you
from the effects of the virus.

01:15.975 --> 01:18.967
lf you leave, you risk
a recurrence of the disease,

01:19.045 --> 01:20.569
which would undoubtedly
prove fatal.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.808
The only option l can think of
at the moment

01:22.882 --> 01:24.975
is contacting the Vidiians.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.882
They have sophisticated
medical technology.

01:26.953 --> 01:29.387
lt's possible
they might be able to help.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.856
We'll take it under advisement,
Doctor.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.825
Thank you for your efforts.
Janeway out.

01:33.893 --> 01:34.951
What do you think?

01:35.028 --> 01:36.290
lt's risky.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.762
The Vidiians have never shown
any willingness to help us.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.663
lt's more likely
they'd attack Voyager

01:40.733 --> 01:42.894
and try to harvest body parts
from the crew.

01:42.969 --> 01:43.936
Agreed.

01:44.003 --> 01:44.992
l just want to make sure

01:45.138 --> 01:47.265
we're not overlooking
a possible alternative.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.001
Could we live with ourselves,

01:49.075 --> 01:51.805
knowing we'd sent Voyager
into that kind of danger?

01:55.415 --> 01:57.042
Janeway to Tuvok.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.549
l'm here, Captain.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.815
You must be aware
of the Doctor's report.

02:01.888 --> 02:02.912
Yes.

02:02.989 --> 02:07.016
l'm turning over command
of the ship to you

02:07.093 --> 02:08.185
on a permanent basis.

02:08.261 --> 02:11.196
Your orders are to resume
a course for the Alpha Quadrant.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.732
And regardless
of the Doctor's suggestion,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.860
you are not to make contact
with the Vidiians.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.063
l understand.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.471
l'll prepare a message
for the crew.

04:12.218 --> 04:15.710
So we're just going
to abandon them on this planet?

04:15.788 --> 04:18.188
Those were Captain Janeway's
express orders.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.555
But you're Captain now.

04:19.625 --> 04:20.820
You can rescind them.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.360
To what end?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.362
l can't believe
we haven't been able

04:24.430 --> 04:26.295
to find a cure
for an insect bite.

04:26.366 --> 04:29.028
The Doctor hasn't deactivated
himself for a month.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.694
He's tried everything.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.930
He's searched every database,

04:32.038 --> 04:34.097
attempted
the most drastic research.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.538
You can't fault him.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.975
l can tell you the morale
of the crew is going to suffer

04:39.078 --> 04:40.841
if we leave them behind.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.710
Not if, Mr. Neelix.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.272
When we leave them behind.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.783
The decision has been made.

04:45.852 --> 04:46.784
We will, of course,

04:46.853 --> 04:48.980
provide them
with everything they'll need

04:49.055 --> 04:50.989
for their survival and comfort.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.684
l am arranging
for a modular shelter

04:52.759 --> 04:54.590
to be transported
to the surface.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.754
They'll have all the technology
they need--

04:56.829 --> 04:59.992
weapons, tricorders,
a replicator.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.524
You talk as though
it were a camping trip.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.196
They have to spend the rest
of their lives down there.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.863
That is not a certainty.

05:06.939 --> 05:10.102
Captain Janeway intends to
continue researching the virus.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.110
She is an able scientist,

05:12.178 --> 05:14.612
and may eventually be able
to effect a cure.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.343
They have a type-9 shuttlecraft
at their disposal,

05:17.417 --> 05:19.442
if it becomes possible
for them to leave the planet.

05:19.519 --> 05:23.683
A type-9 shuttlecraft has
a top speed of warp 4.

05:23.756 --> 05:27.852
lt won't take them more than...
oh, about 700 years to get home.

05:27.927 --> 05:31.454
l am not certain what it is
you expect me to do, Lieutenant.

05:31.531 --> 05:35.558
l guess, clearly,
something you can't do,

05:35.635 --> 05:38.832
which is to feel as rotten
about this as we do.

05:38.905 --> 05:43.171
You are correct that l am unable
to experience that emotion.

05:43.242 --> 05:46.109
And frankly, l fail to see
what the benefit would be.

05:47.413 --> 05:50.143
lf there is nothing more,
you are all dismissed.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.826
Janeway to Tuvok.

06:07.900 --> 06:08.867
Yes, Captain?

06:08.968 --> 06:10.401
We've received the transport.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.700
We'll check it over and let you
know if we're missing anything.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.106
l will remain in orbit
until l hear from you.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.905
And, after that, we can still
remain in communication

06:18.978 --> 06:20.377
for approximately 36 hours.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.437
l'll contact you
before the day is over.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.743
Janeway out.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.376
lt looks like they transported
the contents of the whole ship.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.147
We may have to be here
for a while.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.520
Petri dishes, protein analyzer,
DNA sequencers.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.456
Everything l need
for my research is here.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.391
Do you really think
you can find a cure?

06:35.461 --> 06:37.588
lt may take a while,
but, yes, l do.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.393
lf l can find a specimen
of the insect that infected us,

06:40.466 --> 06:42.730
l can begin analyzing
protein cofactors.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.531
That might give us
the information we need

06:44.604 --> 06:46.265
to find out what it is
in this environment

06:46.339 --> 06:48.307
that's keeping us
from being sick

06:48.374 --> 06:49.466
and how to replicate it.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.971
Does it matter
which way these things go?

06:55.047 --> 06:56.207
l guess it depends
whether you're

06:56.282 --> 06:57.840
in a beige mood or a gray mood.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.282
That's not much of a choice.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.819
Couldn't Starfleet have come up

07:00.887 --> 07:02.115
with something
a little more cheerful?

07:02.188 --> 07:04.019
Like polka dots?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.819
l was thinking more
of a tasteful pinstripe,

07:05.892 --> 07:07.587
something in blues and greens.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.319
Well, l suggest we put

07:10.396 --> 07:12.523
the gray on the outside
and the beige inside.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.530
l like that.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.464
l've always looked better
in beige.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.162
Actually, it might
be kind of interesting,

07:17.236 --> 07:18.225
roughing it for a while.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.396
''Roughing it''?

07:19.472 --> 07:20.598
Let's see.

07:20.673 --> 07:23.699
We have shelter, furniture,
research equipment,

07:23.776 --> 07:26.176
tricorders, a replicator.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.337
lt's too rough for me.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.471
We don't have a bathtub.

07:28.548 --> 07:29.480
A bathtub?

07:29.549 --> 07:30.481
l love a bath.

07:30.550 --> 07:31.915
lt's my favorite way
of relaxing.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.578
Captain, l'm sure you can learn
to love the sonic shower.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.815
You know, Chakotay,
it occurs to me,

07:36.889 --> 07:39.551
we aren't exactly
in a command structure anymore.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.422
Maybe you should call me
Kathryn.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.391
Give me a few days on that one,
okay?

07:49.735 --> 07:51.703
This diagnostic report
looks like it was written

07:51.771 --> 07:53.898
by a first-year Academy cadet.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.565
There are mistakes.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.106
lt's incomplete.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.840
l'm sorry, Lieutenant.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.472
l guess l've been distracted.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.107
We've all been distracted,
Ensign.

08:05.184 --> 08:06.344
That's no excuse.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.182
Yes, ma'am.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.048
l can't get anything done here.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.592
Nobody can concentrate.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.525
l know how they feel.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.064
l'm not feeling
so terrific myself,

08:19.131 --> 08:21.156
but l don't let that
get in the way of my work.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.328
B'Elanna...

08:30.710 --> 08:33.907
l've been talking with some
of the Starfleet crew.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.313
They're not happy
about what happened.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.351
l was wondering...

08:39.418 --> 08:40.783
how are the Maquis taking it?

08:40.852 --> 08:43.048
How do you think
they're taking it?

08:43.121 --> 08:46.785
This isn't a Starfleet issue,
Harry.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.019
lt's affecting everyone.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.358
Then why don't we
do something about it?

08:50.429 --> 08:52.192
Do what?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.926
l don't know.

08:56.068 --> 08:59.128
lt seems like we shouldn't
just accept this.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.331
Well, that's all well and good,

09:00.406 --> 09:02.931
but, frankly, l can't think
of anything else we can do.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.842
lf you have any ideas,
l'll listen.

09:05.912 --> 09:09.109
Otherwise, l think we should
take a deep breath and move on.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.363
Catch anything?

09:24.430 --> 09:26.091
Just the same ones as yesterday,

09:26.165 --> 09:29.191
and they don't seem to carry
the pathogen that's infected us.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.394
Where have you been?

09:30.469 --> 09:31.436
Oh, in the woods.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.471
For the past two days,

09:32.538 --> 09:34.335
you've been spending
a lot of time in the woods.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.874
ls something going on
l should know about?

09:35.975 --> 09:36.907
Uh, not yet.

09:36.976 --> 09:37.908
Not yet?

09:37.977 --> 09:39.239
What's that supposed to mean?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.280
lt means, when it's time
for you to know, l'll tell you.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.644
Don't l even get hints?

09:42.715 --> 09:44.808
l'm building something.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.011
Building?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.485
What could you be building?

09:48.554 --> 09:50.784
And why can't you tell me?

09:50.856 --> 09:52.483
You can't stand it, can you?

09:52.558 --> 09:54.185
You're like a little kid,
wheedling.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.784
Tuvok to Janeway.

09:55.861 --> 09:57.556
Janeway here.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.360
We're about to move
out of communications range.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.594
How are you faring?

10:04.503 --> 10:06.061
We're doing quite well.

10:06.138 --> 10:09.232
l'd like to speak
to the crew now.

10:09.308 --> 10:13.108
Your com link has been
put through to the entire ship.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.678
This is Kathryn Janeway.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.417
l've never liked
saying good-bye,

10:25.491 --> 10:26.788
so l'll make this brief.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.495
But l want you all to know
that serving as your Captain

10:30.563 --> 10:34.158
has been the most extraordinary
experience of my life.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.669
No Captain could ask more
than what this crew has given--

10:37.737 --> 10:41.366
bravery, compassion
and strength of character.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.273
But l think what l'll miss most
is the fun.

10:44.343 --> 10:47.744
The times we joked together,
the games on the holodeck.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.475
l'll remember the laughter
more than anything.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.278
Although Commander Chakotay
and l won't be with you

10:52.351 --> 10:54.319
for the rest of your journey,

10:54.387 --> 10:57.754
we know that you'll be the same
steadfast crew for Mr. Tuvok

10:57.823 --> 10:59.620
as you have been for us.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.923
We wish you a safe
and a speedy journey home.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.963
Our thoughts will be with you.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.022
Janeway out.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.932
Thank you, Captain, Commander.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.970
l am sure l speak
for the entire crew when l say

11:13.072 --> 11:16.667
we will always remember
your grace and courage.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.505
And l would like to add,

11:18.577 --> 11:20.943
it has been an honor
serving with you.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.743
Live long and prosper.

11:29.722 --> 11:34.750
Kathryn Janeway's Personal Log,
Stardate 49690.1.

11:34.827 --> 11:38.820
Day 24 of our stay on the planet
we've named New Earth.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.695
As yet, l've been unable
to make any progress

11:40.766 --> 11:42.996
in finding a cure
for our illness,

11:43.135 --> 11:45.035
but a soak
in the tub Chakotay built

11:45.104 --> 11:48.096
always helps me focus
on possible solutions.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.937
Chakotay, are you there?

11:50.009 --> 11:51.943
No, l left an hour ago.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.206
l was thinking.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.441
Maybe looking
for protein cofactors

11:56.515 --> 11:58.039
is the wrong approach.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.242
Even if l can't find

11:59.318 --> 12:01.650
a specimen of the insect
that infected us...

12:01.721 --> 12:03.450
l could try to learn something

12:03.522 --> 12:07.014
about the biomolecular evolution
of this planet's ecosystem.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.890
Can't hurt to give it a try.

12:12.998 --> 12:13.930
Chakotay!

12:13.999 --> 12:14.931
What?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.024
Someone's in the woods.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.236
Over there.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.540
lt looks like
some kind of primate.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.812
l've detected primate
life-signs here,

12:33.886 --> 12:35.319
but l've never seen one.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.582
Hello.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.227
Are you hungry?

12:43.295 --> 12:45.889
ls that why you came here?

12:49.034 --> 12:50.433
l'm Kathryn.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.993
He's Chakotay.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.333
We've had to move
into your neighborhood,

12:54.406 --> 12:56.465
but l hope we can be friends.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.243
Oh. Maybe he'll come back.

13:03.315 --> 13:05.374
Looking for a pet?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.782
No. Looking for a clue

13:06.852 --> 13:09.286
about primate physiology
on this planet.

13:09.355 --> 13:12.017
They must have to contend
with insect bites, too.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.556
Well... excuse me.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.974
Maybe we should be out
looking for other primates.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.382
l might be missing
something important.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.388
Kathryn...

13:47.827 --> 13:49.089
the Doctor worked for weeks

13:49.161 --> 13:51.288
trying to find a treatment
for this disease.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.352
Yes.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.898
You've been at it
12 hours a day,

13:53.966 --> 13:55.558
seven days a week
since we got here,

13:55.634 --> 13:57.602
and we're still
no closer to a cure

13:57.670 --> 13:59.865
than we were the day
we were infected.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.874
l'm not sure
what you're getting at.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.907
My people have a saying.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.573
''Even the eagle
must know when to sleep.''

14:10.649 --> 14:13.516
Maybe it's time
we both considered that.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.553
You mean quit.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.587
Give up.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.646
Why do you have
to see it as defeat?

14:18.724 --> 14:20.487
Maybe it's simply...

14:20.559 --> 14:23.687
accepting what life
has dealt us,

14:23.762 --> 14:25.593
finding the good in it.

14:30.469 --> 14:34.428
There may be a day when l'll
come to that, Chakotay, but...

14:34.506 --> 14:37.304
l'm a long way
from it right now.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.310
l need to keep looking.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.988
Acting Captain's Log,
supplemental.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.586
After six weeks, the decision

14:58.664 --> 15:01.326
to leave Captain Janeway
and the First Officer behind

15:01.400 --> 15:03.561
still seems to weigh heavily
on the crew.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.028
Captain Tuvok?

15:07.106 --> 15:08.266
Yes, Ensign?

15:08.340 --> 15:12.572
l'm picking up a convoy
on long-range sensors.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.476
lt's Vidiian, sir.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.377
Distance?

15:16.448 --> 15:19.110
Approximately 1.5 light-years.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.449
Lieutenant, alter course
to a different heading.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.682
l don't want to risk
their detecting us.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.286
Sir, the Vidiians...

15:28.360 --> 15:29.384
Yes?

15:29.461 --> 15:31.088
They're within hailing range.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.687
We could ask them
if they know anything

15:32.765 --> 15:34.232
about the Captain's illness.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.665
You're aware
that Captain Janeway

15:35.734 --> 15:38.931
specifically told us not
to risk contacting the Vidiians?

15:39.038 --> 15:43.134
Yes, but it's not like we went
out of our way to find them.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.802
We would just be
taking advantage

15:45.878 --> 15:48.369
of an opportunity
that's presented itself.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.974
That bit of sophistry is not
terribly persuasive, Ensign.

15:52.051 --> 15:57.990
Sir, how can we turn our backs
on this chance to do something?

15:58.057 --> 15:59.786
Don't we have to try?

15:59.858 --> 16:02.850
Don't we owe that to the Captain
and the Commander?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.623
The matter is closed, Ensign.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.028
Return to your station.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.069
What's wrong
with the rest of you?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.162
You know l'm right.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.399
Ensign Kim.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.169
We have a chance to help them.

16:17.242 --> 16:18.709
How can we ignore that?

16:18.777 --> 16:21.575
Ensign, you are
relieved of duty.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.614
Leave the Bridge at once,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.114
or l will have you
put in the brig.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.142
Harry...

16:41.500 --> 16:43.434
Proceed on the altered course,
Lieutenant.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.481
Excuse me, Ensign Kim.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.982
Could we?

16:59.051 --> 17:00.678
Sure. Have a seat.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.148
We just wanted you to know,

17:05.223 --> 17:07.351
we heard what happened
on the Bridge.

17:07.425 --> 17:08.654
And we think
you're absolutely right.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.354
We've got to contact
the Vidiians.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.363
lt's a risk, but it's worth it.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.365
That's what l think,

17:14.433 --> 17:16.731
but Captain Tuvok's
made his decision.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.464
Two Ensigns and a crewman
won't change his mind.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.300
There are a lot more
who agree with us.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.567
A lot.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.165
Really?

17:24.242 --> 17:25.733
Everyone we talk to
can't believe

17:25.810 --> 17:27.403
that Tuvok won't
give this a try.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.106
Come on.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.653
Did you hear what happened
this morning?

17:36.722 --> 17:37.689
Sure did.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.418
Three weeks ago,
you said if l had an idea

17:40.492 --> 17:42.357
about what to do, you'd listen.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.692
l'm listening.

17:44.763 --> 17:48.460
ls there something going on
that l should know about?

17:48.534 --> 17:50.502
Have a seat, Neelix.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.833
We might have come up
with the biggest morale booster

17:52.905 --> 17:54.065
you could possibly imagine.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.774
Come in.

18:10.556 --> 18:11.921
Could l have a moment, sir?

18:15.527 --> 18:17.995
lt's 0100 hours, Ensign.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.054
Don't you have
the early shift this morning?

18:20.132 --> 18:22.327
Yes, sir, but this is important.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.301
Very well.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.737
First of all,
l want to apologize

18:31.810 --> 18:33.641
for my behavior yesterday.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.339
Apology accepted.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.508
l understand that this is
a difficult situation for you.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.619
l'd like to suggest a plan.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.882
lt's something a lot of people
have helped to develop.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.653
We have
two big bargaining points

18:48.727 --> 18:50.922
when it comes to dealing
with the Vidiians.

18:50.996 --> 18:54.659
First, there's the woman
Doc treated-- Danara Pel.

18:54.733 --> 18:55.791
They were very close,

18:55.868 --> 18:57.927
so l'm sure she'd help us
if she could;

18:58.003 --> 19:00.369
and then there's B'Elanna.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.408
Her DNA might lead to a cure
for the phage.

19:03.475 --> 19:07.434
We could offer them some--
in exchange for their help

19:07.513 --> 19:10.038
with a cure
for the Captain and Chakotay.

19:10.115 --> 19:14.677
Those are, as you say,
points in our favor,

19:14.753 --> 19:16.812
but there is also the fact
that we

19:16.889 --> 19:18.720
were recently responsible
for the destruction

19:18.790 --> 19:22.658
of a Vidiian ship,
an act which killed over 300

19:22.728 --> 19:23.956
of their people.

19:24.029 --> 19:27.192
That alone makes it unwise
for us to contact them.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.729
Sir...

19:31.803 --> 19:33.031
l think you should know

19:33.105 --> 19:35.665
how many people on this ship
disagree with you.

19:35.741 --> 19:39.575
Everyone l talked to thinks
we should give this a try.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.044
The people you talked to

19:41.113 --> 19:43.911
do not have the responsibility
of commanding this vessel.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.916
l do.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.418
The safety of this crew
is paramount,

19:48.487 --> 19:51.354
and l must do whatever l can
to ensure that safety.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.256
But if we're willing
to take that risk in order

19:54.326 --> 19:55.384
to help the Captain...

19:55.460 --> 19:59.920
Ensign, l'm going to say this
once and once only.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.466
lf you ever question
my orders again,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.866
you will be relieved
of duty permanently.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.598
The next words

20:06.672 --> 20:10.472
l expect to hear from you
are, ''yes, sir.''

20:15.447 --> 20:16.414
Yes...

20:16.481 --> 20:18.108
sir.

20:33.298 --> 20:36.392
l'm going to check the
insect traps in beta-4.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.096
Oh, what are you up to now?

20:40.739 --> 20:41.899
Making headboards.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.373
Headboards?

20:43.442 --> 20:46.377
l've noticed you sometimes
sit up in your bed to read.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.846
Figured you might as well
have a comfortable backrest.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.940
That's very thoughtful
of you, Chakotay.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.382
You've done so many things

20:53.452 --> 20:55.044
to make our lives
easier here.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.883
The cooking, for example.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.388
l hate to cook.

21:01.226 --> 21:05.094
But what l do makes you
uncomfortable, doesn't it?

21:06.465 --> 21:07.625
Every time l do something

21:07.699 --> 21:11.260
that adds a personal touch
to the shelter, you resist it.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.167
Sometimes it feels...

21:15.240 --> 21:17.265
as though you've given up.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.242
That you're focused
on making a home here

21:19.311 --> 21:21.779
instead of finding a cure
that will let us leave.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.940
l can't sacrifice the present

21:24.016 --> 21:26.348
waiting for a future
that may never happen.

21:26.418 --> 21:30.252
The reality of this situation
is that we may never leave here.

21:30.322 --> 21:33.689
So, yes, l'm trying
to make a home--

21:33.759 --> 21:38.025
something that's more
than a plain gray box.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.698
Someday l may have to let go.

21:42.768 --> 21:46.465
But not today, okay?

21:46.538 --> 21:49.336
l tried a new glucose
bait in the traps.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.273
l have a feeling

21:51.343 --> 21:53.106
this might be the day
l make a breakthrough.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.496
Hello?

22:13.565 --> 22:14.964
Chakotay?

22:48.467 --> 22:49.866
Hello again.

22:53.238 --> 22:56.469
Well, you certainly
cover a lot of territory.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.305
Or are you following me?

23:02.814 --> 23:04.304
Do you understand me?

23:07.519 --> 23:09.316
There.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.253
Know what that is?

23:11.323 --> 23:13.382
That little insect just might be

23:13.458 --> 23:15.688
what gets me
out of your backyard.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.626
What do you think of that, huh?

23:25.303 --> 23:26.497
What is it?

23:31.476 --> 23:33.501
What's happened to the sky?

23:35.580 --> 23:39.277
lf you're suggesting l should
get out of here, l agree.

23:56.401 --> 23:57.595
Oh!

24:03.508 --> 24:04.702
Oh!

24:11.149 --> 24:12.514
Kathryn!

24:14.019 --> 24:15.680
Kathryn.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.278
Are you hurt?

24:17.355 --> 24:20.188
No. l couldn't keep my balance
and carry the case.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.282
Give it to me.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.156
What's happening?

24:23.228 --> 24:25.753
lt seems to be some
kind of plasma storm.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.822
Our tricorders
don't recognize it,

24:27.899 --> 24:29.833
but it sure packs a wallop.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.115
Come in.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.520
Do you have a moment?

24:52.591 --> 24:54.422
Of course.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.858
Please sit down.

24:55.927 --> 24:59.761
l'd like to talk to you...
about my father.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.923
Your father?

25:01.032 --> 25:03.159
He was a very wise man.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.966
More than anyone,
he shaped the person l am.

25:07.038 --> 25:08.266
lf it hadn't been for him,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.808
l would have never questioned
my people's beliefs.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.741
l would have never
left our city.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.506
l would never have met
all of you.

25:14.579 --> 25:16.604
Then we owe him a debt.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.707
lt is difficult to imagine
this journey without you.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.719
When he died,
l had just turned one year old.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.914
l didn't know
how l'd get through

25:24.990 --> 25:27.083
the rest of my life without him,

25:27.158 --> 25:28.853
but then l started
working with you

25:28.927 --> 25:30.827
and l didn't miss him
so much anymore.

25:32.063 --> 25:34.531
l am honored by the comparison.

25:34.599 --> 25:35.827
As Captain,

25:35.901 --> 25:38.096
the well-being of your crew
is important to you.

25:38.169 --> 25:39.898
Of course.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.407
Their emotional well-being

25:43.475 --> 25:45.306
as well as
their physical safety?

25:46.678 --> 25:50.512
l cannot allow myself to become
hostage to their feelings.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.881
Tuvok, they are suffering
because of this.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.747
Maybe you don't know
what it's like.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.845
lf you are suggesting

25:57.923 --> 25:59.788
that l am not sensitive
to the situation,

25:59.858 --> 26:02.190
nothing could be further
from the truth.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.725
l have lost a valued friend.

26:06.798 --> 26:10.234
l am not immune to the effects
of that loss.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.497
Then try to imagine
what it's like

26:12.571 --> 26:15.165
for those of us
who feel things deeply.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.435
A lot of the crew
are on the Bridge,

26:17.509 --> 26:19.067
hoping you'll talk to them.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.392
None of you can appreciate

26:37.462 --> 26:39.657
what it means to be
in command of a ship

26:39.731 --> 26:42.666
until that responsibility
rests squarely on your shoulders

26:42.734 --> 26:44.895
as it does on mine.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.530
lt has been suggested
that l take an action,

26:47.606 --> 26:49.938
which would require me
to disobey an order,

26:50.041 --> 26:53.670
and knowingly put this crew into
a life-threatening situation.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.976
ln general, l believe it
demonstrates faulty leadership

26:57.048 --> 27:00.415
to be guided by the emotions
of a distraught crew.

27:00.485 --> 27:04.854
However, as Captain,
l must not ignore

27:04.956 --> 27:08.119
the sensibilities
of those l command.

27:08.193 --> 27:11.060
We will contact the Vidiians.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.121
This is my decision
and mine alone.

27:14.199 --> 27:18.135
You are all absolved
of responsibility in the matter.

27:18.203 --> 27:21.331
l will accept any consequences
which may ensue.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.671
Lieutenant, set a course
for the Vidiian convoy.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.812
Mr. Kim, let me know
when we're within hailing range.

27:53.071 --> 27:55.301
Oh! Oh, no!

28:04.215 --> 28:05.739
Let's check outside.

28:05.817 --> 28:08.547
Maybe some of the insect traps
are still intact.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.703
None of this
is salvageable either.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.546
There's no way l can
continue to do my research.

28:45.623 --> 28:47.090
l'm sorry.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.398
Well, that's one way
of letting go.

29:00.939 --> 29:05.035
Captain's Log, Stardate 49694.2.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.941
We have contacted
the Vidiian convoy

29:07.011 --> 29:08.638
with encouraging results.

29:08.713 --> 29:11.204
They have promised to
communicate with Dr. Danara Pel

29:11.282 --> 29:13.807
and ask if she will help us.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.410
Sir, the Vidiians
are hailing us.

29:16.488 --> 29:17.716
On screen.

29:19.624 --> 29:21.455
Hello, Lieutenant.

29:21.526 --> 29:22.857
Doctor Pel,

29:22.927 --> 29:24.827
l didn't expect
to see you this quickly.

29:24.896 --> 29:27.524
When l heard what happened, l
boarded the first ship l could.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.328
Tell me about this illness.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.665
They were infected by a virus
after being bitten by insects

29:32.737 --> 29:35.331
on a planet approximately
70 light-years from here

29:35.406 --> 29:37.874
in a system
with a yellow dwarf star.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.035
The third planet
in a system of seven?

29:40.111 --> 29:41.043
Yes.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.044
l know it well.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.512
There's a particular kind

29:43.581 --> 29:45.913
of burrowing insect
that carries the disease.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.748
Years ago, we developed an
antiviral agent to combat it.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.651
Can we get some from you?

29:50.722 --> 29:53.748
Of course. Our Captain said
we could rendezvous with you.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.554
He's transmitted
the coordinates.

29:56.528 --> 29:57.426
l have them, sir.

29:57.495 --> 29:58.928
Thank you, Doctor.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.396
We appreciate your help.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.025
l'm glad l can be of assistance.

30:03.101 --> 30:05.194
Estimated time
to the coordinates?

30:05.270 --> 30:07.670
Approximately 20 hours.

30:07.739 --> 30:10.333
Until then, l want
a series of battle drills.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.876
We must be ready
for whatever comes.

30:14.946 --> 30:15.935
l've been thinking...

30:16.047 --> 30:18.345
there's plenty of wood
available here.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.680
l could probably add
rooms to the shelter.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.413
Give us a little more
living space.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.954
How would you mill it?

30:24.022 --> 30:25.990
l could do a certain
amount with a phaser,

30:26.057 --> 30:28.321
but l was actually
thinking of logs.

30:28.393 --> 30:30.452
As in log cabin?

30:30.528 --> 30:32.655
l built a few of them
when l was growing up.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.631
My father thought it was
important that l learn how.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.635
When l was young, my parents
took us on backpacking trips.

30:38.703 --> 30:39.692
They thought we should all

30:39.771 --> 30:41.329
keep a connection
to our pioneer roots.

30:41.406 --> 30:44.341
l hated it--
no bed, no replicator...

30:44.409 --> 30:46.741
-No bathtub.
-No bathtub.

30:46.811 --> 30:50.474
l guess l was always a child
of the 24th century.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.608
Well...
maybe those camping trips

30:53.685 --> 30:55.516
helped prepare you
for life here.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.054
Oh, no.

30:57.121 --> 30:59.021
Life here is much better
than that.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.857
l think that's the first time

31:02.927 --> 31:05.418
l've heard you say anything
positive about being here.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.293
Well, hello there.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.270
l haven't seen you in a while.

31:14.339 --> 31:15.499
Where have you been?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.535
Do you expect him to answer you?

31:18.610 --> 31:19.668
Not really.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.211
l just sense
intelligence in him,

31:21.279 --> 31:23.076
and l could swear
he came to warn me

31:23.147 --> 31:24.341
about the plasma storm.

31:24.415 --> 31:25.575
Come here, fella.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.117
Come on.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.455
l doubt that he
can be domesticated--

31:32.523 --> 31:33.888
at least not very easily.

31:36.227 --> 31:40.254
Well, we have plenty of time.

31:40.331 --> 31:43.095
The rest of our lives.

31:46.037 --> 31:47.504
That's a long time.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.071
At least l hope so.

31:52.310 --> 31:53.937
Well, l can't give you
orders anymore,

31:54.012 --> 31:56.242
but l suggest we get
back to work.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.372
Aye, aye, Captain.

32:08.459 --> 32:11.155
l guess l'm not used
to that kind of work.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.399
My knots are getting knots.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.866
Here, let me help.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.856
Oh, that feels good.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.919
l've had a lot
of practice at this.

32:43.995 --> 32:47.522
My mother used to get
sore necks all the time.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.624
l was the only one she'd trust
not to make it worse.

33:14.592 --> 33:15.718
That's much better.
Thank you.

33:18.129 --> 33:21.690
Well... l'm going
to go to bed now.

33:21.766 --> 33:22.926
l'll see you in the morning.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.468
Sleep well, Kathryn.

33:25.536 --> 33:27.800
Yes.

33:27.872 --> 33:29.396
You, too.

34:25.696 --> 34:26.663
Got something.

34:26.731 --> 34:30.292
Vidiian ship,
bearing 325 mark 5.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.699
Hail them.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.402
They aren't responding.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.235
Trying
on alternating frequencies.

34:36.306 --> 34:39.174
l'm reading a second ship,
177 mark 5.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.609
l've got it.
Now a third.

34:41.679 --> 34:42.976
They're surrounding us.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.311
None of them are answering hails

34:45.382 --> 34:46.940
and their weapons are powered.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.246
Red Alert.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.695
We have to talk about this.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.272
All right.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.140
l think we need to define
some parameters...

35:15.213 --> 35:17.374
about us.

35:17.448 --> 35:21.475
l'm not sure l can...
define parameters.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.050
But l can tell you a story--

35:26.124 --> 35:28.991
an ancient legend
among my people.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.454
lt's about an angry warrior

35:34.532 --> 35:35.464
who lived his life

35:35.533 --> 35:37.262
in conflict
with the rest of his tribe--

35:37.335 --> 35:39.462
a man who couldn't find peace,

35:39.537 --> 35:41.630
even with the help
of his spirit guide.

35:44.375 --> 35:48.334
For years, he struggled
with his discontent.

35:48.412 --> 35:51.381
But the only satisfaction
he ever got

35:51.449 --> 35:54.145
came when he was in battle.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.743
This made him a hero
among his tribe,

35:56.821 --> 36:00.279
but the warrior still longed
for peace within himself.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.758
One day, he and his war party

36:02.827 --> 36:05.955
were captured
by a neighboring tribe

36:06.030 --> 36:08.225
led by a woman warrior.

36:08.299 --> 36:11.530
She called on him to join her

36:11.602 --> 36:14.571
because her tribe was too small
and weak to defend itself

36:14.639 --> 36:15.731
from all its enemies.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.866
The woman warrior
was brave and beautiful

36:18.943 --> 36:20.308
and very wise.

36:21.712 --> 36:24.203
The angry warrior
swore to himself...

36:25.950 --> 36:27.679
that he would stay by her side,

36:27.752 --> 36:31.313
doing whatever he could
to make her burden lighter.

36:31.389 --> 36:34.222
From that point on,
her needs would come first.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.222
And in that way...

36:40.565 --> 36:43.432
the warrior began to know...

36:43.501 --> 36:45.128
the true meaning of peace.

36:50.241 --> 36:52.402
ls that really...

36:52.476 --> 36:54.910
an ancient legend?

36:59.884 --> 37:01.511
No.

37:03.521 --> 37:06.046
But that made it easier to say.

37:36.854 --> 37:38.082
Shields down to 58 percent.

37:38.155 --> 37:41.215
Rearm the forward phaser
array and fire at will.

37:41.292 --> 37:42.384
Firing.

37:43.861 --> 37:46.455
Shields down to 47 percent.

37:46.530 --> 37:48.464
Sir, there are just
too many of them.

37:48.532 --> 37:49.794
Load aft torpedo bays.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.601
Torpedoes armed.

37:52.670 --> 37:53.694
Fire number one.

37:59.410 --> 38:00.274
Report.

38:00.378 --> 38:01.811
They're still coming.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.572
Fire number two.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.149
Tuvok to Engineering.

38:07.218 --> 38:08.242
Torres here, sir.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.310
Listen carefully.

38:15.426 --> 38:17.053
She has a broken arm.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.720
Set it
with the osteogenic stimulator.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.457
l think there's someone
on the monitor.

38:20.531 --> 38:21.498
This way.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.625
Odd. Why wouldn't they
just use the com line?

38:26.270 --> 38:27.737
l don't think this is coming
from our ship.

38:27.805 --> 38:28.829
Shmullus...

38:28.906 --> 38:30.874
Shmullus, can you hear me?

38:32.209 --> 38:33.176
Danara.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.508
Shmullus,
l have to do this quickly.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.342
l'm on one of the Vidiian ships.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.441
Do they know
you're contacting me?

38:40.518 --> 38:41.576
Are you in any danger?

38:41.652 --> 38:44.587
No. Everyone's too focused
on the battle.

38:46.090 --> 38:50.618
Oh, Shmullus, l swear l didn't
know they planned to attack.

38:50.695 --> 38:53.630
l thought we were on
an errand of mercy.

38:53.698 --> 38:54.630
l believe you.

38:54.699 --> 38:56.496
l have the antiviral serum here.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.296
lf you could use your
transporter to get it to your...

38:58.369 --> 38:59.301
Our shields are up.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.735
We can't transport anything
through them.

39:01.806 --> 39:03.797
l don't know what else
to suggest.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.502
All right.
l'll see what l can do.

39:06.577 --> 39:08.477
Maybe we can lower the shields

39:08.546 --> 39:10.070
long enough
to transport the serum.

39:10.147 --> 39:12.012
Sick Bay to Bridge.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.485
This is Tuvok.

39:15.553 --> 39:16.781
We're rather busy here, Doctor.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.822
Doctor Pel is on
one of the Vidiian ships.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.379
lf we can drop
our shields briefly,

39:20.458 --> 39:21.823
we can beam aboard the serum.

39:21.892 --> 39:24.224
Keep this com line open, Doctor.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.126
When you hear me
order the shields down,

39:26.197 --> 39:28.631
you must complete a site-to-site
transport yourself.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.530
We will be busy
with the Vidiians.

39:30.601 --> 39:31.863
Understood.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.130
Bridge to Engineering.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.193
Report.

39:34.271 --> 39:35.863
We're ready to eject
the antimatter container.

39:35.973 --> 39:37.634
Stand by for my command.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.699
Here is the sequence of events.

39:39.777 --> 39:42.644
We will drop shields
to transport the medicine.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.907
At the same moment,

39:43.981 --> 39:45.915
the antimatter container
will be ejected.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.143
As soon as it's clear,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.686
Mr. Kim will detonate it
with a photon torpedo.

39:49.754 --> 39:53.155
Simultaneously, Mr. Paris
will jump to full impulse,

39:53.224 --> 39:55.283
so that we will not take
the brunt of the explosion.

39:55.359 --> 39:57.418
ls everyone clear on this?

39:57.495 --> 39:59.656
Timing is
of the utmost importance.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.823
We won't get a second chance.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.023
Understood.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.192
Aye, sir.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.292
We're ready down here.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.836
Doctor?

40:06.904 --> 40:08.064
l've set up
to make the transport.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.197
Stand ready, then.

40:12.510 --> 40:15.274
Lower shields.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.280
lnitiating transport.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.714
Ejecting
the antimatter container...

40:19.784 --> 40:21.149
now.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.150
We've got it.

40:25.222 --> 40:26.985
Raise shields.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.082
Mr. Kim, Mr. Paris?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.593
Go.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.094
Firing torpedo.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.701
Report.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.170
The Vidiian ships
are all disabled, sir.

40:42.239 --> 40:43.467
They're not pursuing.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.532
Ready to go to warp, sir.

40:46.577 --> 40:47.805
Set a course for the planet

40:47.878 --> 40:50.176
where we left the Captain
and Commander Chakotay.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.407
Warp 6.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.143
Aye, aye, sir.

41:17.675 --> 41:18.801
How are they coming?

41:21.245 --> 41:22.712
Very nicely.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.271
We should have vine-ripened
Talaxian tomatoes

41:25.349 --> 41:26.976
in a couple of months...

41:27.051 --> 41:29.815
unless this planet has
the equivalent of tomato bugs.

41:29.887 --> 41:31.684
Oh, they're awful.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.986
l would never have thought
of you as a gardener.

41:35.059 --> 41:38.256
Hmm. l grew up around farmers.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.594
My parents insisted we learn
some basic gardening skills.

41:41.665 --> 41:42.927
Did you hate that
as much as camping?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.160
Of course.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.226
Who wanted to muck around
in the dirt

41:46.303 --> 41:48.669
when you could be studying
quantum mechanics?

41:49.740 --> 41:54.200
But... l find it
very satisfying now,

41:54.278 --> 41:57.076
watching the seeds sprout
and grow.

41:59.450 --> 42:00.974
lf your tomatoes
could spare you for a minute,

42:01.085 --> 42:03.610
l'd like your opinion
on something in the house.

42:03.654 --> 42:05.087
You've come
to the right person.

42:05.155 --> 42:06.452
l always have an opinion.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.650
Really?

42:16.834 --> 42:18.165
What do you think?

42:18.235 --> 42:19.600
A boat.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.501
You said you wanted
to explore the river?

42:21.572 --> 42:22.937
l think l could build this.

42:23.007 --> 42:25.134
We could go on a camping trip.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.700
l'm not sure we could fit
the bathtub in the boat.

42:27.778 --> 42:29.268
Well, that's all right.
l'll have the river.

42:30.514 --> 42:31.913
Do you hear that?

42:31.982 --> 42:33.779
Yes.

42:37.254 --> 42:38.881
...to Captain Janeway.

42:38.956 --> 42:40.514
Do you read me?

42:40.591 --> 42:45.187
This is Tuvok calling Captain
Janeway and Commander Chakotay.

42:45.262 --> 42:47.594
Please respond.

42:47.665 --> 42:50.133
This is Janeway.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.725
Captain, it's good
to hear your voice.

42:52.803 --> 42:53.895
We have news.

42:53.971 --> 42:55.199
What is it?

42:55.272 --> 42:56.705
We have medicine
which we believe

42:56.774 --> 42:58.742
will effectively treat
your condition.

42:58.809 --> 43:01.972
We plan to be in orbit
within 30 hours.

43:16.860 --> 43:17.849
Ready?

43:27.004 --> 43:29.302
There you are.

43:31.008 --> 43:33.340
At least l get to say good-bye.

43:36.246 --> 43:39.340
Feel free to use the house.

43:52.863 --> 43:54.990
Janeway to Voyager.

43:55.065 --> 43:56.532
Two to beam up.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.412
Welcome back, Captain.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.880
Commander.

44:13.951 --> 44:15.213
The Doctor tells me

44:15.285 --> 44:17.719
you contacted the Vidiians
after all.

44:17.788 --> 44:19.756
l disobeyed your order, Captain.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.223
l am prepared to accept
the consequences.

44:22.292 --> 44:24.886
lf l didn't know you better,

44:24.962 --> 44:28.454
l'd say your decision
was almost... emotional.

44:28.532 --> 44:30.363
Thank you all.

44:30.434 --> 44:31.594
Well, we've lost time
with all this.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.931
Let's see if we can make
some of it up.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.231
Mr. Paris, warp 8.

44:34.304 --> 44:35.066
Aye, Captain.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.106
Commander, we'll need

44:36.173 --> 44:37.401
to review
the ship's systems.

44:37.474 --> 44:39.704
l'll handle propulsion,
environmental and communication.

44:39.777 --> 44:40.835
You'll be responsible

44:40.911 --> 44:42.879
for sensors, weapons
and transporters.

44:42.946 --> 44:43.913
Aye, Captain.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.881
l'll have a report to you
by 1800 hours.

44:46.917 --> 44:48.145
Check with phaser maintenance.

44:48.218 --> 44:49.446
See if they solved that problem

44:49.520 --> 44:50.987
with the prefire
chamber temperature.

44:51.055 --> 44:52.079
Yes, ma'am.

44:52.156 --> 44:53.953
l'll see to it.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
