WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:06.070
And then came the Third Day
of Christmas...

00:06.773 --> 00:09.765
and still no one had
made a present for Santa.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.176
Whom shall I ask to
help me, boys and girls?

00:13.246 --> 00:14.474
I know.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.179
Ask the reindeer on your left hand.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.276
I'd love to help...

00:21.654 --> 00:24.646
but I have my hooves full as it is.

00:27.327 --> 00:31.024
I get it. His hooves are full.
He don't have no hands, I get it.

00:31.364 --> 00:35.061
Hey, G, I did not see that coming.
This is dope, right, Ash?

00:35.602 --> 00:36.967
- Ashley!
- I'm awake.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.699
I don't know why I bother.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.074
It's impossible to compete
with tawdry entertainment...

00:44.144 --> 00:47.170
like MTV, Nintendo...

00:47.247 --> 00:49.442
the new children on the block.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.911
Thanks a lot, Ash. Now I'll never
know how the story ends.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.153
I really wanted to know
what Santa got for Christmas.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.217
He doesn't get an actual gift, Will.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.956
He gets the love of all the little children
in the world.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.760
Really? What a gyp.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.726
Come on, Will.
Everyone knows there's no Santa Claus.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.404
Wait a minute, there is no Milli Vanilli...

01:20.480 --> 01:22.914
but there definitely is a Santa Claus.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:34.854 --> 02:37.880
Okay, Ash, let's write our letters
to Santa Claus.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.159
Here, you can help me with my list.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.854
How do you spell "Vanessa Williams"?

02:44.531 --> 02:47.557
Don't you have anything better to do
with Christmas vacation...

02:47.634 --> 02:49.124
than writing a silly letter?

02:49.269 --> 02:52.534
What are you gonna do with your
vacation? Play with your friends?

02:52.605 --> 02:54.266
I wish I had someone to play with...

02:54.340 --> 02:56.706
but every year my friends
all go out of town...

02:56.809 --> 02:58.106
and I'm stuck here all alone.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.703
You can still have fun while you're here.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.375
I'm going to. I've decided to learn
a new word every day.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.909
Ashley, that's boring.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.579
Really? I think it's very autodidactic.

03:11.524 --> 03:15.221
Christmas vacation is finally here.
God help me, I do love it so.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.025
I thought you liked school, Carlton.

03:18.097 --> 03:21.533
Ash, I think Bel-Air Academy
is one of the best schools in the country.

03:21.601 --> 03:26.038
Its academics and sports program
are excellent, and the faculty is first-rate...

03:26.105 --> 03:29.734
but around December 10, it starts to get
a little old. Know what I mean?

03:31.177 --> 03:34.510
Carlton, we got a problem.
Your sister, 10 years old...

03:34.581 --> 03:36.879
and doesn't know
the meaning of Christmas.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.747
I know the meaning of "undulate."

03:40.386 --> 03:44.413
I don't know where this Christmas thing's
going, but I've got bigger fish to fry.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.926
I've got to raise $600 more
for my Glee Club ski trip.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.621
Give you $1 if you shave your head.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.262
I've booked the Alligaroos
to sing at a bunch of Christmas parties.

03:55.335 --> 03:59.362
If we make enough money,
on December 26 we'll all be...

04:00.607 --> 04:02.472
Imitating Jerry Lewis?

04:03.042 --> 04:04.976
I've got to rehearse now.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.035
Guys, let's use this room.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.542
Let's start with our opening number.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.580
Five, six, five, six, seven, and...

04:30.703 --> 04:31.863
Hold it!

04:31.938 --> 04:34.429
What the bloody hell kind of song is that?

04:36.809 --> 04:38.276
What do you mean?

04:38.344 --> 04:41.802
A little kid sees his mom
tongue-wrestling with Santa Claus?

04:42.081 --> 04:45.073
Will, it's his father
dressed up like Santa Claus.

04:46.719 --> 04:50.450
Why'd he dress up like... I get it.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.047
I dress up like Santa Claus.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.958
You dress up like the Easter Bunny.
That makes me sick.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.328
We're putting together a program
for Jonathan's parents' party tonight.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.390
Jonathan's stepfather
is a record producer...

05:01.467 --> 05:03.799
and he asked us not to do
tired old Christmas carols.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.235
Here's our program.

05:06.773 --> 05:07.967
Wait a minute.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.268
<i>You Don't Bring Me Flowers...</i>

05:10.343 --> 05:14.370
<i>People Who Need People,
The Way We Were.</i>

05:14.447 --> 05:16.881
Who's coming down the chimney,
Barbra Streisand?

05:18.184 --> 05:20.152
You've been to my parents' parties?

05:21.921 --> 05:25.084
That would be fantastic. All right.

05:25.291 --> 05:29.284
Also, I want to send a box
of the fancy chocolate-covered pretzels...

05:29.362 --> 05:31.159
to Mr. Patrick Swayze.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.625
Right. The card should read:

05:33.700 --> 05:38.296
"Pat, saw these and immediately
thought of you. Love, Hilary. XXX."

05:38.838 --> 05:43.332
Send the same thing to Kevin Costner,
Michelle Pfeiffer and Sting.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.937
Great, thanks.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.105
That takes care of the A-list.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.276
Now, should I send the box of pears
or the meat thermometer...

05:54.354 --> 05:55.651
to Steve Guttenberg?

05:58.257 --> 06:02.819
Hilary, I hate to inject some reality
into these proceedings...

06:02.895 --> 06:04.692
but who you trying to fool, baby?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.664
What do you mean?

06:07.734 --> 06:11.261
You always walk around fronting
like you know all these famous people.

06:11.337 --> 06:12.497
You don't know nobody.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.872
Will, you are so jaded and skeptical.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.808
You remind me so much of Judd Nelson.

06:21.948 --> 06:25.406
Philip, we'll spend an hour
at your office party, then we'll come home.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.283
- I have papers to grade.
- Okay, but first things first.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.788
Do you remember the names
of all my partners' wives?

06:30.857 --> 06:31.915
Yes.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.222
- Who is George Meyer's wife?
- Eunice.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.464
That was last year.
The new wife's name is Kelly.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.266
Kelly? Walter's secretary?

06:44.537 --> 06:49.065
- Now, who is Jack Fitzgerald's wife?
- Doris.

06:49.709 --> 06:54.009
The correct answer is Heather,
formerly the muffin-cart girl.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.276
Wait a minute. How many new wives
are going to be at this party?

06:59.352 --> 07:02.515
Let's put it this way, Vivian.
You're the only repeat.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.158
Hold up.
You guys going to a Christmas party?

07:07.226 --> 07:11.822
- It's just an office Christmas party.
- I remember ours back in Philly.

07:12.899 --> 07:16.130
The building would be filled
with the sounds of Christmas.

07:16.202 --> 07:19.228
Jingle bells and singing and laughing.

07:19.305 --> 07:22.468
Then at the end of the evening,
the traditional police sirens.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.003
Those were the days.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.312
I'll just go bring the car around.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.949
Aunt Viv, does this neighborhood
do anything special for Christmas?

07:33.019 --> 07:34.145
Not really.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.950
Last year, President Reagan's
Secret Service agents...

07:37.023 --> 07:40.151
dressed up as Santa and warned
everyone to keep their distance.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.488
That was kind of festive.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.593
Aunt Viv, this is terrible.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.326
People in Bel-Air don't know
how to celebrate Christmas.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.698
- I'm worried about Ashley.
- What do you mean?

07:49.769 --> 07:53.000
Growing up in Bel-Air,
she never had a real Christmas.

07:53.072 --> 07:57.008
There's no sledding, there's no caroling...

07:57.076 --> 08:00.512
there's no winos making
snow angels on the front lawn.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.643
You don't even decorate the living room.

08:05.718 --> 08:10.382
Yes, we do. We've already started.
The poinsettias, the red candles...

08:10.456 --> 08:12.686
and here's the beautiful crystal nativity...

08:12.758 --> 08:15.022
your uncle gave me
for Christmas years ago.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.597
Where's little baby Jesus?

08:20.967 --> 08:23.435
- Right there.
- That little disk?

08:24.770 --> 08:28.536
There are more decorations coming.
A wonderful shop in Beverly Hills...

08:28.608 --> 08:32.169
comes to the house, sets up the tree
and decorates it for us.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.174
Do they open your presents
and wear your sweaters, too?

08:36.215 --> 08:39.446
If you want to show Ashley
a little more of the Christmas spirit...

08:39.519 --> 08:42.249
why don't you go to the shop,
pick up the decorations...

08:42.321 --> 08:45.848
and you and Ashley
can decorate it yourself, okay?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.620
All right, then.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.890
This is going to be hype.
Have fun at the office Christmas party.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.833
Thanks, I'm looking forward
to meeting all the new wives.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.871
I hope they bring their Barbie dolls.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.574
Will, were you vociferating for me?

09:04.143 --> 09:05.838
I got to get back to you on that.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.710
You want to go to Beverly Hills with me
and get the decorations?

09:09.782 --> 09:12.478
- Okay.
- We can sing Christmas songs all the way.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.019
Great. Here's one Carlton taught me.

09:24.797 --> 09:25.855
Hi.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.926
Merry Christmas.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.669
Aren't these figures outstanding?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.934
They're beyond outstanding,
they're deeply beyond.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.631
They're hand-carved.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.677
We import them from Poland.

09:40.346 --> 09:43.110
We're looking for
some Christmas decorations.

09:43.182 --> 09:46.549
Let me show you something
we're doing now that's deeply happening.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.019
It's a Caribbean Christmas tree.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.651
It's very big in London, it's beyond big.

09:54.727 --> 09:58.686
It's all about very hot oranges
and very intense yellows.

09:59.665 --> 10:03.533
I feel it's a very vibrant tree,
and I feel it's a very important tree.

10:06.806 --> 10:10.401
We're just picking up the decorations
for my mother, Mrs. Banks.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.309
Yeah, she phoned and told me...

10:13.379 --> 10:16.507
you'd be putting them up
yourselves this year, which is fine.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.642
You'll save yourself a little money,
which is a good thing...

10:19.719 --> 10:23.985
because the '90s
are going to be all about restraint.

10:29.495 --> 10:32.055
Is this the wreath for the door?

10:32.198 --> 10:36.692
Yeah. Let's talk about
that wreath for a moment, if you will.

10:37.436 --> 10:41.873
Last year, I was so deeply into
the distant salmons and the sandy beiges.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.808
But this year I went
more with the muted roses...

10:44.877 --> 10:48.574
with these little arrogant touches
of celadon and periwinkle.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.145
I think it worked out quite nice.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.548
Let's try something wild here, you know?

10:58.624 --> 11:02.492
Do you have anything red or green...

11:02.561 --> 11:06.429
or, I don't know,
maybe something like a Santa Claus?

11:08.267 --> 11:09.529
It's been done.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.232
Excuse us.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.705
These decorations are wack.
We'll save Aunt Viv a lot of money...

11:21.781 --> 11:24.045
and buy them somewhere else. Let's go.

11:24.784 --> 11:28.185
Excuse me.
You forgot your box of decorations.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.790
No, you see, we're going to do
our own decorations this year.

11:31.891 --> 11:36.351
It's going to be about arrogant little elves
and rambunctious reindeer...

11:36.796 --> 11:39.321
and little men in red suits.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.424
I think it will be deeply, deeply dope.

11:48.941 --> 11:52.206
We should've left
that stupid office party an hour earlier.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.178
I still have 30 papers to grade.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.714
We're both busy, but we
can't work in the car...

11:56.782 --> 11:59.751
so why don't we take this time
to relax a bit?

12:00.953 --> 12:02.147
You're right.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.847
Look how nicely they decorated
the house on the corner.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.694
Those white lights on the tree outside.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.992
Just the right touch of lights.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.028
A little goes a long way, you know.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.528
God, I used to love
Christmas when I was little.

12:18.604 --> 12:21.038
Now it just rushes by in one big blur.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.702
Christmas is more for kids.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.540
You know, even though we're busy...

12:26.612 --> 12:28.910
I think we should do
something nice for Will.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.711
Must be hard for him spending
Christmas in a strange place.

12:31.784 --> 12:35.481
Yeah, you're right, sweetheart.
We'll do something nice for him.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.114
Surprise!

13:06.318 --> 13:08.582
- Ashley, sweetie.
- Where's Will?

13:10.022 --> 13:13.389
- Aren't you surprised, Mommy?
- Where is Will?

13:13.993 --> 13:17.121
I had so much fun today with Will,
you can't believe it.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.895
Surprise!

13:21.967 --> 13:23.832
Look, it's Will.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.268
Will, what happened
at the Christmas shop?

13:27.339 --> 13:30.502
Aunt Viv, they were trying to rip you off.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.101
So me and Ashley went down
to the Pick 'n' Grab.

13:46.192 --> 13:49.628
Hello. Yes, this is Philip Banks.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.727
You saw our lights.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.569
The blinking Frosty the Snowman
is riling your attack dogs.

13:59.538 --> 14:00.971
That's wonderful.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.565
Our neighbors are furious.
We must take down the lights.

14:03.642 --> 14:08.409
Uncle Phil, I bet there's a lot of neighbors
that love those decorations.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.380
I mean, certainly anyone
who possesses good taste.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.019
Banks residence.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.016
Brother, you got a problem
with my lights?

14:22.394 --> 14:24.624
Why don't you come tell me
that to my face, then?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.494
You can do whatever you want to do.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.261
It's your world, squirrel.
I'm just trying to get a nut.

14:32.004 --> 14:35.371
What? We can do this.
That was clever, Trevor.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.102
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.438
Yeah, all right.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.279
Madam, sir.

14:42.681 --> 14:45.809
A group of your neighbors
have assembled on the front lawn.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.651
They're looking at your Christmas
decorations and growing enraged.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.814
They are threatening
to burn Frosty in effigy.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.959
We'd better get out there.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.493
Geoffrey, thanks for helping us
put up those Christmas decorations.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.093
I'd have never had the guts
to climb up on that roof...

15:05.170 --> 15:06.933
with that reindeer strapped on my back.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.673
Anything in the name of Christmas,
Master William.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.344
Your aunt and uncle
didn't suspect anything, did they?

15:13.412 --> 15:14.401
No.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.516
Still, I think it's best we avoid eye contact
for the rest of the evening.

15:20.686 --> 15:21.880
10-4.

15:29.495 --> 15:33.158
- Should I talk to them? Or do you want to?
- No, I'll give it a try.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.496
- Dad, can I offer a suggestion?
- Sure.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.467
They're our neighbors and they're upset.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.972
It's up to us to make sure
that this doesn't ruin their Christmas.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.373
There's only one way to do that.
I think we should write a few checks.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.644
Sit down, Carlton.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.272
As you wish, Father.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.448
I'll have to tell them we'll take
the decorations down as soon as we can.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.513
Can't we leave some of them up?

15:58.590 --> 16:01.058
I don't know, maybe we can reach
a compromise.

16:01.126 --> 16:05.495
Everybody, in keeping
with the spirit of the season...

16:05.564 --> 16:07.998
I think we can discuss this rationally.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.833
Property values in this neighborhood
must be vigorously protected.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.065
Isn't that right, Mr. Uesato?

16:14.139 --> 16:17.973
I'm afraid potential buyers
aren't too crazy about the Kmart look.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.879
You know dear, there are wonderful
services that will come...

16:21.947 --> 16:23.642
and decorate your house for you.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.014
But this year our daughter
and nephew decided...

16:26.085 --> 16:27.450
to do the decorating themselves.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.319
I see. Are they very angry with you
over something?

16:33.959 --> 16:35.085
No, why?

16:35.160 --> 16:39.790
This reminds me of the summer
my daughter Amanda turned 15...

16:39.865 --> 16:41.765
and tried to burn our house down.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.395
Master William.

16:45.237 --> 16:47.671
There is a gentleman
in the foyer who claims...

16:47.740 --> 16:50.334
you had some harsh words
with him on the phone.

16:50.476 --> 16:53.104
Oh, yeah? That chump is here?
Send him in.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.937
Fighting doesn't solve anything.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.948
Aunt Viv, ain't gonna be no fight.

16:57.016 --> 17:01.316
I can tell by the sound of this guy's voice
on the phone, I could take him in a minute.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.654
Mr. Evander Holyfield.

17:15.067 --> 17:19.026
The undisputed
Heavyweight Champion of the World.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.646
Nice champion.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.180
I recognize your voice.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.623
You're the chump I talked
to on the telephone.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.785
Phone? I ain't talked to you on no phone.

17:44.530 --> 17:47.465
- Evander.
- Hilary.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.091
You know her?

17:53.205 --> 17:55.435
Where were you last night
at Bruce Willis' party?

17:55.507 --> 17:59.068
I'm not speaking to Bruce.
I'll tell you about it later.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.217
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't know you lived here.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.255
Frankly, I saw the lights
and I thought they were...

18:10.355 --> 18:11.720
a little tacky.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.124
Look!

18:16.428 --> 18:19.397
I didn't mean for everybody
to get so upset.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.164
You might as well just
take all the lights down.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.725
- Ashley.
- It's okay, Dad.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.040
Now, come on. The house looks dope.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.874
Who cares what they think?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.710
Bet you Santa thinks it's nice.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.547
I know you're trying to get me
into the Christmas spirit...

18:40.619 --> 18:42.587
but I'm just not into it.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.288
All those people are in a bad mood...

18:45.557 --> 18:48.253
none of my friends
are around to play with.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.451
I'm going to go up to my room...

18:50.529 --> 18:53.464
learn some new word
and wait until New Year's.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.560
That was great. Who are you guys?

19:23.629 --> 19:25.324
- Hi, I'm Mark Driscoll.
- How you doing?

19:25.397 --> 19:27.729
Every year, I take
the neighborhood kids around...

19:27.799 --> 19:29.266
to look at the Christmas lights.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.632
They choose one house
as the best-decorated...

19:31.703 --> 19:34.069
then sing carols
for the people who live there.

19:34.139 --> 19:37.768
- This year, you guys won.
- We drove all over.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.210
Yeah, and usually this neighborhood
is a complete dud.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.178
We weren't even going to come here...

19:45.284 --> 19:47.411
until Jimmy saw the house
from the freeway.

19:51.723 --> 19:55.523
I tell you what, we've got cookies
and hot chocolate inside. Come on in.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.517
All right, let's go.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.022
- Thanks. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.393
Ashley, I seem to remember you saying...

20:06.471 --> 20:09.440
you wanted some friends
and there they are.

20:09.841 --> 20:12.139
Still don't believe
that there's a Santa Claus?

20:15.514 --> 20:17.812
I'm glad we cleared up this little matter.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.750
I assume the lights will
be down by tomorrow.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.379
Wait. I've changed my mind.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.515
- I want the lights to stay up.
- Fight the power, Ashley.

20:30.095 --> 20:32.495
I love them. They're beautiful.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.927
I'm not the only one who thinks so.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.163
Will thinks so, too,
and so do all these kids.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.234
And besides, it's Christmas.

20:40.706 --> 20:44.369
When I look at the lights and the reindeer
and the decorations...

20:44.443 --> 20:47.844
it makes me feel very ebullient.

20:49.648 --> 20:50.774
Yeah, me, too.

20:52.684 --> 20:56.017
Ashley's right.
What are we arguing about here?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.420
When we were kids,
we used to all love Christmas.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.958
And now we take things too seriously.

21:01.026 --> 21:04.291
Personally, I think the lights
are kind of neat.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.197
I guess they're really not hurting anybody.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.326
And the kids really like them.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.893
We shouldn't be fighting. It's so barbaric.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.570
Then we're all agreed?

21:21.647 --> 21:25.981
I think those decorations are totally
inappropriate for a home in Bel-Air.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.986
Madam, another of your neighbors
has arrived.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.318
Great, that's all we need.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.824
Excuse me.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.662
Hello, everybody. Hi, there, Hilary.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.399
Thanks for the pretzels.

21:45.470 --> 21:49.497
I'm sorry to bother you, neighbor.
I just want to say that...

21:49.641 --> 21:53.702
I greatly admire your wonderful
Christmas decorations...

21:53.779 --> 21:57.306
and I just wanted to say that
because Nancy won't let me...

21:57.382 --> 21:59.179
do anything fun to our house.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.879
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- It's a pleasure.

22:02.954 --> 22:06.617
A few of our neighbors came to tell us
about our lights, too.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.660
What were you saying, Mr. Grey?

22:11.063 --> 22:14.897
I was just saying they were
absolutely magnificent, Mr. President.

22:14.966 --> 22:19.630
- That's what I think.
- This is what Christmas is all about.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.869
Now comes the magic moment.
Everybody gather around the TV.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.876
Will, what are you doing?

22:25.944 --> 22:28.071
This is one of our Christmas traditions.

22:28.146 --> 22:31.274
I like to watch out for
this certain commercial.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.442
A commercial?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.917
You know the one where it's all snowy...

22:34.986 --> 22:38.012
and the little jolly Santa is
riding on a Norelco shaver?

22:40.425 --> 22:42.120
I love that commercial.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.855
And that Christmas beer commercial...

22:43.929 --> 22:47.524
with the horses with the furry feet
are pulling the sleigh through the snow.

22:47.599 --> 22:50.568
I loved that commercial where
the little covered wagon...

22:50.635 --> 22:53.035
is being chased by the dog
across the kitchen floor.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.169
He's on the shaver!

23:03.305 --> 23:09.241
