00:47.867 --> 00:49.696
It's alive!

01:08.069 --> 01:11.297
- Man, Greg is really pissin' me off.
- Big Greg or little Greg?

01:11.336 --> 01:13.961
- Little Greg in Accounting.
- Yeah, he's a prick.

01:14.002 --> 01:15.628
To 25 years of marriage.

01:15.669 --> 01:16.896
To evil!

01:16.936 --> 01:20.834
To 30 days of sobriety.

01:20.870 --> 01:22.768
Oh, crap.

01:22.803 --> 01:25.894
¤ When you wake up in the morning
what's the first thing that you see? ¤

01:25.936 --> 01:28.835
¤ It's your morning wood ¤

01:28.871 --> 01:30.461
¤ Morning wood ¤

01:30.504 --> 01:32.697
Well, hello, morning wood!

01:36.438 --> 01:38.870
Billy, were you playing
with your morning wood?

01:38.905 --> 01:39.928
No.

01:39.972 --> 01:43.268
No need to be embarrassed, honey.
Your dad has morning wood, too.

01:43.305 --> 01:44.930
¤ Look around your neighborhood ¤

01:44.972 --> 01:47.768
¤ Everybody has morning wood ¤

01:47.806 --> 01:49.431
Hello, I'm Bruce Campbell...

01:49.472 --> 01:52.870
and I can't start my day
without waxing my morning wood.

01:52.906 --> 01:53.929
Morning wood.

01:53.973 --> 01:56.496
From the makers
of slow dance chubby.

01:56.540 --> 01:59.199
If Bill Gates offered you
a billion dollars...

01:59.240 --> 02:02.434
to be his ass slave for a year,
would you do it?

02:02.473 --> 02:03.905
No way! Never.

02:03.940 --> 02:05.929
Ass slave?
Are you kidding me?

02:05.974 --> 02:08.532
OK.
Mike, how much would it take...

02:10.174 --> 02:12.164
for someone
to run over your nuts?

02:14.142 --> 02:15.472
Two million dollars.

02:15.508 --> 02:16.769
Done!

02:17.575 --> 02:19.768
Now, I'm gonna
get the money, promise?

02:19.809 --> 02:21.638
Of course, dude.
You rule.

02:26.443 --> 02:28.908
It's heavier than I thought!

02:32.109 --> 02:33.837
I can do a nut transplant...

02:33.877 --> 02:36.502
but it'll cost exactly two million dollars.

02:36.543 --> 02:37.532
Oh, man.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.940
- Plus tax.
- Oh, man!

02:39.977 --> 02:41.136
Welcome home, dude.

02:41.177 --> 02:45.439
You're a legend to us, hombre,
but everyone else thinks you're nuts.

02:45.477 --> 02:47.376
Nuts! Get it?

02:47.412 --> 02:49.877
It took me a month
to come up with that.

03:08.047 --> 03:09.979
Oh, my God!

03:10.013 --> 03:12.172
Damn it, doctor,
what did you do to me?

03:12.213 --> 03:14.543
I'm sorry, Mike,
all we had to transplant...

03:14.580 --> 03:16.637
were the nuts of a serial killer.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.646
No!

03:18.680 --> 03:22.443
Idle Nuts,
starring Jessica Alba.

03:22.481 --> 03:26.573
You know, I'd want to attack you with
my nuts even if they weren't possessed.

03:26.615 --> 03:28.047
Thanks?

03:29.448 --> 03:31.676
Also starring Seth Green.

03:31.715 --> 03:35.375
I'm a pot smokin' corpse,
bottle in my head!

03:35.416 --> 03:37.314
Gotta stop the madness!

03:47.150 --> 03:50.117
Hi, I'm Bill Gates.
I heard you take insane bets...

03:50.151 --> 03:53.913
and wondered if you'd be
my ass slave for a billion dollars?

03:53.950 --> 03:55.416
I'll get my coat.

03:57.518 --> 04:01.575
They said it could never happen,
but they were wrong.

04:05.918 --> 04:09.544
Shiver with fear
as the abomination runs amok.

04:09.585 --> 04:12.415
Giant midget. Run!

04:15.986 --> 04:21.214
Tremble with terror
when the creature cannot be stopped.

04:32.821 --> 04:36.185
Witness the beast
devouring everything in his path.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.287
Nothing is beyond his reach...

04:56.257 --> 04:59.018
- Yes, a mermaid!
- This hook hurts.

04:59.057 --> 05:00.648
Now give me my three wishes.

05:00.690 --> 05:04.588
What the hell are you talking about?
There's a hook in my face!

05:04.624 --> 05:07.250
You mean
mermaids don't grant wishes?

05:07.291 --> 05:09.655
That's genies, you ass.

05:09.691 --> 05:14.783
Oh, man. I've wasted
the last 20 years of my life.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.122
However, I happen to be a genie...

05:20.159 --> 05:23.250
who only looks like a mermaid.

05:23.292 --> 05:24.690
What a twist.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.020
I'm Bruce Wayne.

06:01.896 --> 06:03.328
My knee!

06:20.231 --> 06:24.925
I'm so bored, Falkor.
Is anything going on tonight?

06:24.964 --> 06:28.056
Nothing, Atreyu.
Nothing.

06:28.098 --> 06:29.257
What's Bastian up to?

06:29.298 --> 06:31.423
"And then the boy took a big crap. "

06:31.465 --> 06:34.125
Hey, I'm taking a big crap.

06:35.832 --> 06:38.526
Everyone in Fantasia's doing nothing.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.032
It's like we've been hit
by a nothing storm!

06:41.067 --> 06:44.363
I think it's time
for a neverending party!

06:52.001 --> 06:55.092
¤ Friday night ¤

06:55.134 --> 06:57.692
¤ Boring as can be ¤

07:00.201 --> 07:03.168
¤ Buy some booze ¤

07:03.202 --> 07:07.964
¤ Every cheap 40 ¤

07:08.002 --> 07:09.969
¤ Call up all the crazy... ¤

07:10.002 --> 07:13.366
Those look like big, strong hands.

07:13.402 --> 07:15.868
- Don't they?
- Can you open this for me?

07:17.703 --> 07:18.895
Spray it all over me!

07:22.270 --> 07:26.294
We are so...

07:26.337 --> 07:28.326
wasted.

07:28.371 --> 07:30.394
Say my name, Bastian.

07:30.438 --> 07:32.836
Say my name!

07:40.839 --> 07:43.270
This party is ending right now!

07:44.906 --> 07:47.236
West side.

07:47.273 --> 07:51.069
¤ Neverending party ¤

07:57.107 --> 07:58.697
Good evening, Omaha.

07:58.740 --> 08:01.764
And oma how are ya?
It's flu season.

08:01.808 --> 08:03.296
Ross Hathaway has the story.

08:03.340 --> 08:06.171
Flu season means
trips to the pharmacy, missed work...

08:06.208 --> 08:08.696
and kids coming home
with crusty shirt sleeves.

08:08.741 --> 08:11.503
But surprisingly,
giant robots are the hardest hit.

08:11.542 --> 08:14.599
The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
offer great health insurance.

08:14.642 --> 08:17.608
But even a Ranger
can get the flu and call in sick.

08:18.775 --> 08:22.469
Being a Zord down
really leaves the Rangers in a bad way.

08:22.509 --> 08:25.498
Also effected was Voltron.

08:25.543 --> 08:28.771
And the menacing Devastator.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.734
We now take you to our eye in the sky...

08:32.775 --> 08:34.708
for today's live car chase.

08:34.744 --> 08:37.403
Officers are in pursuit
of a white sports car...

08:37.443 --> 08:40.672
which failed to yield
for a routine traffic stop.

08:40.710 --> 08:44.073
Good Lord! The sports car
now appears to be on fire!

08:44.111 --> 08:48.510
No, it's a smoke screen!
I've never seen anything like this.

08:48.545 --> 08:50.704
More later as the story develops.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.677
Now, shocking amateur news footage...

08:52.711 --> 08:55.576
acquired by this program
so that we may shock you with it.

08:55.612 --> 08:58.271
- Give me that!
- No! Help, police!

08:58.312 --> 09:02.006
There's no need to fear.
Underdog is here!

09:02.046 --> 09:05.842
Holy fucking shit balls!
You're a talkin' dog!

09:05.879 --> 09:07.505
A talking dog? Really?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.342
Great ass fucking Moses!

09:09.380 --> 09:12.347
Can you speak?
Can you say something, doggie?

09:14.314 --> 09:17.246
OK. There's no need...

09:17.281 --> 09:19.770
He talks! He really talks!

09:19.815 --> 09:21.576
A fucking talking dog!

09:23.215 --> 09:24.578
That's it... holy...

09:24.614 --> 09:26.944
- The dog can fly!
- And it flies!

09:26.981 --> 09:30.345
And now, the weather
with chief meteorologist Paris Hilton.

09:30.382 --> 09:32.871
- It's hot.
- My ear is saying something to me.

09:32.916 --> 09:35.609
There's new developments
in that freeway police chase.

09:35.649 --> 09:38.115
The sports car is now
tailgating a semi truck.

09:38.149 --> 09:41.445
Holy... He's apparently
got himself an accomplice...

09:41.483 --> 09:44.472
But wait a minute, there he is.
He's back on the road.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.078
Oh, my God!

09:49.117 --> 09:51.140
He just destroyed that helicopter...

09:51.184 --> 09:53.673
with some sort of ground-to-air missile!

09:53.717 --> 09:57.809
Apparently, that was the traffic helicopter
from our associates at Channel 5.

09:57.851 --> 10:00.716
Our hearts go out
to their entire news team.

10:00.752 --> 10:03.912
Once loveable, the Shirt Tales
are causing controversy...

10:03.952 --> 10:06.282
at the local zoo
with their new T-shirts.

10:06.319 --> 10:10.547
Look, man, you can't reach kids these days
with crap slogans like "hug me. "

10:10.586 --> 10:11.574
Yeah!

10:11.619 --> 10:14.585
If it grows in the ground,
it was meant for me.

10:14.619 --> 10:16.051
That's right, sweetheart.

10:16.087 --> 10:18.519
What can I do?
Every time I chase them...

10:18.554 --> 10:21.520
the Shirt Tales take off
in that fucking flying car of theirs.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.986
Son of a bitch!

10:23.021 --> 10:26.817
I'm just getting word that police
are closing in on the killer sports car.

10:26.854 --> 10:31.116
Why don't motorists realize
they just can't outrun the police?

10:31.154 --> 10:33.518
Unless they have a speedboat...

10:33.555 --> 10:35.885
like the one
he's taking off in right now!

10:35.922 --> 10:39.184
Ladies and gentlemen, we're getting
word of panic throughout the city.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.188
We turn to our internet expert for more.

10:41.222 --> 10:44.814
A new worm is deleting
not only the porn on people's hard drives...

10:44.856 --> 10:47.617
but all the porn
on the internet entirely.

10:47.656 --> 10:50.487
We're now seeing live footage
from downtown Boston...

10:50.523 --> 10:52.988
where social order
has completely broken down.

10:53.023 --> 10:55.319
I was only halfway done.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.013
Halfway done!

10:58.057 --> 11:01.921
We now take you to the White House,
where a press conference is underway.

11:01.957 --> 11:05.720
My fellow Americans, I give you my word
that the United States of America...

11:05.758 --> 11:09.952
will find, capture, and punish those
responsible for this great national tragedy.

11:09.991 --> 11:13.185
And if the perpetrators are listenin',
I have only this to say.

11:13.225 --> 11:15.657
It's not funny, man.
Give us back our porn.
