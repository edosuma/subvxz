WEBVTT

00:16.842 --> 00:19.976
Careful, Luca, these guys
ripped off enough nitroglycerin

00:20.020 --> 00:21.586
to make that thing
a mobile bomb.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.501
Good thing
we're in a mobile tank.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.115
You said this was a simple job
for some friends of yours.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.204
There wasn't supposed
to be a guard on duty!

00:30.247 --> 00:31.596
I'll get us
out of this.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.250
Just keep driving.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.743
Chris, Luca, you guys okay?

00:47.786 --> 00:49.745
We're Code 4. Betty took most

00:49.788 --> 00:51.616
of the hit for us, but I think
we're out of this fight.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.966
Get her back <i>
to HQ to get fixed up.</i>

00:54.010 --> 00:55.751
<i>We'll take it from here.</i>

00:55.794 --> 00:59.276
- 24-
- David, I got eyes on you and the van from the airship.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.062
That van has more barrels,
and our ride does not

01:02.105 --> 01:03.846
have the same armor
Black Betty does.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.201
Whoa!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.727
<i>He's headed south</i> <i>
into oncoming traffic!</i>

01:43.190 --> 01:45.105
We got to get 'em
out of the city.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.150
Deacon, rally the backup

01:47.194 --> 01:49.457
to the 4th Street Bridge.
I've got an idea.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.677
<i>Get this thing down</i> <i>
on the ground in front of him.</i>

01:52.721 --> 01:55.680
<i>We need to turn him around.</i>

02:23.273 --> 02:25.754
I think we lost them.

02:33.196 --> 02:36.460
Deacon, he's crossing <i>
the bridge, heading your way.</i>

02:36.504 --> 02:37.940
- 30-
- David. We're in position.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.160
We got eyes on the van now.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.040
This is the LAPD.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.563
We have you surrounded.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.262
Exit the van, get on the ground,

02:55.305 --> 02:57.133
and spread your arms and legs.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.702
This is my fault.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.399
I took the job.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.140
I lost my cool.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.448
I'll fix this, Charlie.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.971
I'm the big brother.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.581
Supposed
to take care of you.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.236
Look, we're both idiots, okay?

03:13.280 --> 03:16.631
I repeat,
get out of the van now.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.376
Get down on the ground now.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.857
I have something to say,
and you better listen,

03:25.901 --> 03:27.772
or I'll take down this whole
bridge and everyone on it!

03:27.816 --> 03:29.687
You will not be told again.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.646
Drop your weapon,
get on your knees.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.125
Put your hands
behind your head.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.257
Duff, what the hell
are you doing, man?

03:34.301 --> 03:35.476
Get down on the ground,
Charlie!

03:35.519 --> 03:36.999
Just listen to me. I got this!

03:43.048 --> 03:44.180
I acted alone!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.703
My brother didn't know

03:45.747 --> 03:47.792
what he was driving me to do.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.881
None of this is his fault!

03:56.801 --> 03:59.151
We've got a jumper!

04:00.414 --> 04:03.373
Hold your fire!

04:03.417 --> 04:04.853
I love you, Charlie.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.253
Duff!

04:16.473 --> 04:18.388
I got you.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.880
Where do y'all think
you're going?

04:31.923 --> 04:33.534
The photographer
from the police commission's

04:33.577 --> 04:35.231
been in my office
all night,

04:35.275 --> 04:38.147
waiting to take a team photo
for the new LAPD website.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.802
Oh, was that today?
'Cause I got plans.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.934
Yeah, I got to get home
- to an ice bath, doctor's orders.
- Yeah.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.415
Commander, my team's earned
a night to put their feet up.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.112
We'll take the photo tomorrow,
I promise.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.680
All right, first thing
in the morning, no excuses.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.769
Later.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.076
It's the third time
you've put the photo off, Hondo.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.947
Police commission's getting
a little impatient.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.819
They should be happy that
I agreed to do it at all.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.517
- They just want 20-
- Squad because we check all the boxes

05:00.561 --> 05:01.779
on their diversity
bingo card.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.172
Okay, well...

05:03.215 --> 05:05.392
regardless, you did
a hell of a job tonight.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.524
- Whole team did.
- Thank you, sir.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.791
Morning, baby.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.098
Where do you think
you're going?

05:16.141 --> 05:17.795
You know it's your turn
to make breakfast.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.232
Two unis out of Hollywood missed
a dispatch call last night.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.365
Their cruiser was just found,
and they weren't in it.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.627
Oh, my God.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.412
Yeah, Hicks is calling
everybody in.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.804
I'm sorry I got to run.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.633
Can I make it up
to you tonight?

05:29.677 --> 05:31.418
Mmm.
Sergeant Harrelson,

05:31.461 --> 05:33.507
this'll be six nights
in a row I've slept over.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.987
We're trying to make
a baby, remember?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.076
The last time I checked,
you can't do it

05:38.120 --> 05:40.078
from separate beds.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.559
I love you.
I love you.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.609
Hondo, wait.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.742
The local news just posted
about your missing officers.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.875
They found
their body cams.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.746
There's a video.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.922
Officer Lumbard? Birch?

05:57.966 --> 05:59.968
Or is it the other way around?

06:00.011 --> 06:02.362
Sorry, it's easy to mix
- the two of you up.
- Hondo, his voice.

06:02.405 --> 06:05.539
Both white,
both new to the force.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.976
- And both abusing your power.
- What is this?

06:08.019 --> 06:10.195
My name is Daniel Harrelson.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.806
A lot of you may know me
as the officer

06:11.849 --> 06:14.156
who blew the whistle
on the LAPD last summer.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.592
I'd like to tell you
that it made a difference,

06:15.636 --> 06:17.202
but guess what.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.944
There's still a lot
of bad cops out there.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.558
Take these two.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.429
Been on the beat for
a little over a year,

06:26.473 --> 06:28.344
and they've already got a list
of complaints against them.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.781
Does the LAPD care?

06:30.825 --> 06:32.522
I'm out of patience.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.959
Cops need to be held accountable
for their actions.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.571
You don't see me hiding my face.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.532
I'm done waiting on the
department to clean itself up.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.146
What the hell is this?

06:48.190 --> 06:51.019
Okay, that's you.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.847
But that can't be you.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.457
- That video is fake.
- But it was taken off

06:54.501 --> 06:56.459
of a real LAPD body cam.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.463
Someone's setting me up, Nichelle.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.465
I was here with you all night.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.380
I know, but the whole world
is gonna see this.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.555
What are you gonna do?

07:10.125 --> 07:11.561
You have to call
your boss.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.302
He'll sort this out,
keep you safe.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.043
No, I can't.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.306
Hicks'll bench me.
He might even have to arrest me.

07:17.349 --> 07:19.395
But you have an alibi.
I'll tell them... The word

07:19.439 --> 07:21.789
of my girlfriend ain't gonna
hold up against video evidence.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.269
Or at least not till
this thing gets debunked.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.882
Hondo?

07:27.925 --> 07:30.667
Two police cars just pulled
into your driveway.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.714
What if..? Do they think
you really did this?

07:33.757 --> 07:35.672
Baby, I got to go.
I got to leave right now.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.457
- What? No.
- Look, if someone's

07:37.500 --> 07:38.980
really trying to set me up, it
might only be the beginning.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.677
I can't be tied to a desk

07:40.721 --> 07:42.374
or sitting in a cell waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.202
You'll be safe
with the officers.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.683
Just tell them the truth.
Everything's gonna be okay.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.294
Where are you going?

07:49.338 --> 07:51.340
To find out who the hell's
behind this.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.386
Thanks for coming.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.996
How bad is it?

08:39.040 --> 08:41.346
Every cop in L.A.'s got
a picture of your face.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.739
Unis just picked
up Nichelle.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.306
And they're going through
your house right now.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.395
- Are you sure this is the play?
- Someone's trying to ruin

08:46.438 --> 08:48.528
my life, Deac-- I got
- to figure out who and why.
- All right.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.052
Well, in that case, you're
gonna need a way to get around.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.750
Take Annie's car.
Don't scratch it.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.491
You don't want her
coming after you, too.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.798
I'm sorry I pulled you
into this.
Hey, stop.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.713
We'll always have
your back.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.370
Deacon, you called in the team?

09:06.807 --> 09:09.113
None of you should
be here right now.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.593
The second you get to HQ,

09:10.637 --> 09:12.334
they're gonna question you
about my whereabouts.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.988
I'm not letting any of you
lose your job because of me.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.380
Sorry, boss. When somebody
messes with you,

09:15.424 --> 09:16.904
they mess with all of us.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.819
Besides, whoever actually
killed those officers,

09:18.862 --> 09:20.124
- they're still out there.
- Rest of LAPD's looking

09:20.168 --> 09:21.952
for you, we need
to be looking for them.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.000
All right, then.
What do we know?

09:26.043 --> 09:27.915
Unis found Lumbard
and Birch's cruiser

09:27.958 --> 09:29.786
in a Denny's parking lot,
about 5:00 a.m.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.136
Car was untouched,
no sign of a struggle.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.399
Dash cam showed the two of them
arriving about midnight.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.140
- Grabbed some food.
- Someone knew their patterns

09:36.184 --> 09:37.707
and then grabbed them
on their break.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.579
About an hour after the
cruiser was found, their body

09:39.622 --> 09:42.190
cams were dropped
- at a local news station.
- One was wiped clean,

09:42.233 --> 09:43.844
and the other had
the video of you on it.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.367
So whoever made
this fake video

09:45.410 --> 09:47.151
actually put it
on an LAPD body cam?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.240
I got a friend
who might be able to tell us

09:49.284 --> 09:51.547
how someone could do that.
She's not exactly...

09:51.591 --> 09:54.506
law-abiding, but she's probably
not gonna call the cops

09:54.550 --> 09:55.943
- the second she sees your face.
- All right, great.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.205
She's who I visit first.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.336
Well, hold on,
you're not going alone.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.729
What'd I just say, Street?

09:59.773 --> 10:01.601
I ain't dragging anybody
else down with me.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.777
That's too bad 'cause
she's my contact-- I'm going.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.434
Fine.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.045
The rest of you check
on Lumbard and Birch.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.003
There's got to be a reason
they were targeted.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.050
Hey?

10:17.051 --> 10:18.574
Thanks.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.925
All of you.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.979
You're late. Follow me.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.503
Now, I'm not gonna ask you
where you're coming from

10:34.546 --> 10:36.853
because I don't want to have to
put you in the position to lie.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.768
Sir, I can honestly say
I have no idea

10:38.812 --> 10:40.596
- where Hondo is right now.
- Well, keep it that way.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.773
Now, obviously, I know it
can't be Hondo in that video,

10:43.817 --> 10:46.080
but since dropping this
morning, this execution

10:46.123 --> 10:48.604
has been shared by every
major news station.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.388
Now a lot of people think
Hondo's a cop killer.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.390
- All right, I've got 20-
- Squad working on finding out

10:52.434 --> 10:54.479
how the video was made
and who made it.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.743
Well, whoever it was
did their homework.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.789
Now, Lumbard and Birch
were not shy about voicing

10:59.833 --> 11:02.574
their unhappiness with some
of the city's social programs.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.272
Now, just, you know,
cop venting,

11:04.315 --> 11:05.577
but they called Hondo out

11:05.621 --> 11:07.405
a few times,
and they were not fans.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.103
Yeah, makes it look
like Hondo has motive.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.018
- What about the rest of 20-
- Squad?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.715
Internal Affairs is
gonna grill us.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.238
All right,
I'll stall IAD

11:14.282 --> 11:16.066
as long as I can,

11:16.110 --> 11:18.721
but there is a highly trained
LAPD sergeant on the run,

11:18.765 --> 11:20.854
so I don't know how long I'm
gonna be able to hold them off.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.638
So whatever Hondo's doing,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.509
he needs to do it faster.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.735
Thanks for helping us, Elyse.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.519
Anything for you, Jimbo.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.913
I mean, you gave me a way to
pay rent that didn't involve

11:36.957 --> 11:39.176
email scams or
credit card fraud.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.048
I, uh, convinced Elyse
to become

11:41.091 --> 11:43.964
our go-to cybercrimes expert
in Long Beach back in the day,

11:44.007 --> 11:46.096
before that was
a real job.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.751
When it did become a real job,
LBPD wouldn't hire someone

11:48.795 --> 11:51.145
with a criminal record,
and they just let me go.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.799
Don't worry,
I made my investments

11:52.842 --> 11:54.452
in crypto early, so...

11:54.496 --> 11:56.454
I am set for life.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.282
All about pro bono
hacktivism now.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.807
Okay, don't tell
us about that.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.591
We're already in the middle
of one felony today.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.028
Fair enough. I've already
downloaded the video.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.074
It's, uh, definitely a deepfake.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.598
Phony media that uses
artificial intelligence

12:09.641 --> 12:11.600
to study photos and videos
of a person,

12:11.643 --> 12:14.342
and then creates a new video
of that person doing something

12:14.385 --> 12:17.084
- they've never done before.
- How can you tell this is a deepfake?

12:17.127 --> 12:19.216
When in doubt, look at the eyes.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.436
AI hasn't quite mastered replicating

12:21.479 --> 12:22.872
blinking yet--
just doesn't get it.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.874
This video, however,
is incredibly tight.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.398
Deepfakes are generated
frame by frame.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.531
You slow 'em down enough...

12:30.880 --> 12:33.404
...you can catch a funky one.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.232
My pops always told me
to only believe what

12:35.276 --> 12:36.668
you can see with your own eyes,
now we can't even do that.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.453
Tech's only
getting better.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.542
Pretty soon, even I won't be
able to tell the difference.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.022
Good luck prosecutingsomeone

12:42.065 --> 12:43.893
with video evidence
in a few years.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.939
Y-You're telling me
any keyboard cowboy

12:45.982 --> 12:47.331
in his mom's basement

12:47.375 --> 12:48.942
with the right software
can do this?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.421
It takes a little bit
more than that.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.423
You need
a baseline video.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.251
Real footage of someone

12:54.295 --> 12:55.862
who looks like your subject
for the program to manipulate.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.342
So there's an original video
out there without me in it.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.692
How did they make it
look like me?

13:00.736 --> 13:02.694
Let me see your phone.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.263
Deepfakes require
a ton of modeling data.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.526
Images and other media

13:08.570 --> 13:11.051
of the subject they're copying.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.314
In this case, you.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.882
The more, the better.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.362
Here.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.321
Someone installed
spyware onto your phone.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.410
Your photos and videos were
being linked

13:22.453 --> 13:23.846
to another computer in the city.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.543
How could someone do
that without me knowing?

13:25.587 --> 13:27.241
A real pro just needs to be
- on the same Wi-
- Fi as you.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.069
Can you find out where
his data's going?

13:29.112 --> 13:31.419
It'll take me a few hours,
but no one can hide from me.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.420
Text Street if you find
something, please.

13:32.463 --> 13:33.595
Yeah, of course.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.510
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.605
Any luck finding anything
on Lumbard or Birch?

13:43.648 --> 13:45.302
The temperature around
here is ice-cold.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.565
I hit up every cop I know
who may have crossed paths

13:47.609 --> 13:49.437
with them over
the last year.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.091
Most ignored my calls, but the
ones who picked up were more

13:51.134 --> 13:52.962
interested in trashing
Hondo than sharing intel.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.964
My old shift commander
runs their division now.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.748
I figured he'd at least have
a few other suspects

13:56.792 --> 13:59.012
for us to chase down. Nope.
He thinks Hondo's a killer

13:59.055 --> 14:00.840
and I'm a traitor
for saying otherwise.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.538
How is it so many cops actually
believe Hondo's guilty?

14:03.581 --> 14:05.409
Because they want to believe
it-- they've been waiting

14:05.453 --> 14:07.498
for an excuse to turn on him,
and now they have it.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.891
Take it you're getting
the silent treatment, too?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.153
I was, so I
got creative.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.807
You know Wells from Evidence?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.461
Turns out he's got a new puppy.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.897
I promised to house-train
and dog-sit it

14:14.941 --> 14:16.507
on his next vacation, so...

14:16.551 --> 14:18.205
he slipped me this.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.902
It's a copy of all
the data from Lumbard

14:19.946 --> 14:21.686
and Birch's squad car--
GPS, dash cams,

14:21.730 --> 14:23.645
radio calls, everything.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.125
LAPD's already been
through it, though.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.648
They were looking for things
that pointed to Hondo.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.867
We're looking
for who really killed them.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.655
You're putting a lot on the
line, riding with me today.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.918
- I appreciate it.
- Well, it's been a while

14:35.962 --> 14:37.659
since I've played hooky
from SWAT.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.879
Wouldn't want people to think
I lost my bad-boy edge.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.970
Seriously, though?

14:44.013 --> 14:46.015
I'm a different man

14:46.059 --> 14:48.888
than the one who joined, and
I have you to thank for that.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.194
Everything you've done,

14:51.238 --> 14:54.545
even kicking me off
for a hot minute,

14:54.589 --> 14:57.984
you did it to make me
a better officer.

14:58.027 --> 15:00.160
I'll always have
your six, man.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.292
No questions asked.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.390
Any idea who might
be behind all this?

15:13.434 --> 15:15.001
Been thinking about
that all morning.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.176
You put away
countless criminals.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.307
Who's got
the biggest grudge?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.222
- That's a long list, kid.
- Yeah.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.658
But this isn't just
some corner kid

15:20.702 --> 15:22.269
that you put away
for five to ten.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.574
This deepfake?

15:23.618 --> 15:25.489
Someone
with serious resources

15:25.533 --> 15:27.187
is targeting you.

15:27.230 --> 15:30.103
I mean, that kind of hate,
that's next level.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.800
Are you sure this hacker friend
of yours knows what she's doing?

15:31.843 --> 15:32.844
Yeah, these things take time.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.629
Elyse is the best, though.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.631
As soon as she finds out where
your hacked phone data's going,

15:36.674 --> 15:38.111
she'll let me know.
We just...

15:38.154 --> 15:40.200
need to hold out
a little longer.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.595
No surprises on Lumbard and
Birch's abandoned cruiser GPS.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.467
They didn't go anywhere
out of the ordinary.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.208
Same with the dash cam footage.
They're unis.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.079
Lots of sitting around, waiting
for the action to happen.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.994
Hey, check this out,
I've been going through

15:52.038 --> 15:54.605
the logs on the cruiser's
automatic license plate reader.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.390
One plate keeps popping up
over and over,

15:56.433 --> 15:57.565
almost 50 times.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.001
And every time
on the rear camera.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.742
Almost as if... Someone's following them,

16:00.785 --> 16:02.744
learning their routine,
just like Hondo said.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.789
Plate belongs
to Pasha Kulpa.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.748
No criminal record,
but it looks like he owns

16:06.791 --> 16:08.315
five apartment buildings
in the Valley.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.578
Which is usually code for
"I'm up to super shady stuff

16:10.621 --> 16:12.275
and need to hide it."Hold on,
he's got a federal file.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.842
Looks like he's got ties

16:13.885 --> 16:15.278
to organized crime
in Eastern Europe,

16:15.322 --> 16:16.845
and the Feds suspect
he's running

16:16.888 --> 16:18.368
his own small outfit
here in L.A.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.674
What's this Kulpa guy
got to do with Hondo?

16:19.717 --> 16:21.981
What do you say we find out?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.335
This lot's registered as Kulpa's
current business address.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.990
Luca, right.
Chris, left. Tan, door.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.475
Pasha Kulpa! LAPD!

16:52.098 --> 16:54.752
Clear!

16:59.714 --> 17:01.803
That's a lot
of computer power for a site

17:01.846 --> 17:03.544
that hasn't even
broken ground yet.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.199
Kulpa was just here-- the
computer's still logged in.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.030
My name is Daniel Harrelson...

17:11.073 --> 17:12.683
This must be
the original video,

17:12.727 --> 17:14.337
the one they manipulated
to look and sound like Hondo.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.470
Kulpa probably
edited the video here.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.254
This is proof
that the Hondo video's fake.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.864
I'm done

17:19.908 --> 17:22.824
waiting for the department
to clean itself up.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.049
That good?

17:30.092 --> 17:32.051
Yeah, we're good.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.751
The gunshots were fake.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.622
But that's still the real
Lumbard and Birch,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.755
which means... They might still be alive.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.368
Elyse couldn't narrow it
down to the exact room,

17:45.412 --> 17:47.153
but whoever hijacked your phone,

17:47.196 --> 17:49.894
their I.P. address puts them
somewhere inside this hotel.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.551
Go talk to the front desk.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.336
See if you can get
a list of recent guests.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.468
I'm gonna hang back.
- I don't want to be spotted.
- Okay.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.833
You must be the man of the hour.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.096
A.J.:Maybe you need
a permanent reminder

18:17.139 --> 18:18.880
of who's in charge here.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.623
You took my son.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.407
And you'll pay greatly for it.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.979
Hondo.

18:31.022 --> 18:34.156
Took you long enough to find me.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.636
I've been waiting
for you.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.116
Arthur Novak.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.682
You're supposed
to be in prison.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.207
Money and connections go
a long way in Mexico.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.078
You left me with both.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.949
No, I checked on you.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.603
You were serving real time.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.736
Hey, Hondo? Hondo?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.868
I spent six months

18:50.912 --> 18:52.740
in a filthy cell,

18:52.783 --> 18:54.785
fighting
to stay alive every day,

18:54.829 --> 18:57.527
mourning my boy every night.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.704
But eventually I got
my hands on a phone.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.185
And from there,
access to my accounts.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.796
After that,
it was just a matter of time

19:05.840 --> 19:08.712
until I paid
the right people off.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.454
Or otherwise brought 'em
into check.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.717
- You should've stayed down there.
- I'm not worried.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.372
I'm a free man, Hondo.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.287
Can't say
the same for you.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.075
Don't worry about her
alerting the police.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.513
I called them the second
I saw you outside.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.080
They should be here
any moment now.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.430
Why don't you sit?

19:30.473 --> 19:31.953
Have a drink
with me.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
You won't find wine
like this in prison,

19:35.261 --> 19:36.784
I promise you.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.357
That weak-ass deepfake
ain't gonna hold up.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.749
You should've never shown
your face,

19:45.793 --> 19:47.142
'cause now I'm coming for you.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.926
The deepfake was just
the beginning.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.973
Look forward
to seeing you again.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.149
Sergeant Harrelson,
show us your hands!

19:54.193 --> 19:56.325
Do not make
this difficult.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.979
On your knees.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.328
On your knees!

20:21.002 --> 20:23.874
I just gave my official
statement to the chief.

20:23.918 --> 20:27.008
I'm no longer a suspect thanks
to the footage y'all found.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.271
Tech team verified it--
it's the original video.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.664
- I'm a free man.
- Yeah.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.232
Okay, guys, this
ain't over yet.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.103
Lumbard and Birch
are still missing.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.800
They could be alive,
barely hanging on

20:36.844 --> 20:38.367
and counting on us
to find 'em.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.282
But first...

20:40.326 --> 20:43.285
there's something
I need to tell y'all.

20:43.329 --> 20:46.288
I wasn't straight with you
about what happened last summer

20:46.332 --> 20:47.724
- in Mexico.
- The man at the hotel.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.292
Arthur Novak--
he and his son ran

20:50.336 --> 20:52.294
the town I was staying in
like crime bosses.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.513
And when they threatened
an innocent family,

20:53.556 --> 20:54.731
I had to step in.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.298
Novak retaliated.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.995
And kidnapped
a young woman.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.955
I led a rescue mission,
but things went sideways.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.176
I had to kill Novak's son
to save her life.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.790
That's why he's
coming after you.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.705
All of this is
some kind of revenge play.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.402
First it was the deepfake,

21:13.446 --> 21:14.882
and now he's holding
these two officers' lives

21:14.925 --> 21:15.970
over my head.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.975
We're sorry you had to go
- through this, Hondo.
- Deacon, I don't need sympathy.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.498
I need your help

21:22.542 --> 21:24.195
to find Lumbard and Birch.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.242
Okay.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.810
Novak has help.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.028
A guy named Pasha Kulpa.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.334
Looks like
the two go way back.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.988
There's matching arrests
here for robbery,

21:34.031 --> 21:35.772
theft and assault all over
Europe going back to the '80s.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.079
Makes sense-- we know Kulpa
helped make the deepfake.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.950
Dude even has a cameo
in the video we found.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.126
All right, so we double down
on our sweep for Kulpa.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.476
We find him,
we find the officers.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.478
We find the officers,
we find Novak.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.870
I'll hit up
his business properties.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.350
Luca and I'll take
known associates.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.395
Yeah.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.874
Where are you going, Hondo?

21:50.918 --> 21:52.833
Novak's confident
that he's safe in the U.S.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.096
I'm gonna prove him wrong.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.707
Yeah, well, Novak wasn't lying.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.535
His record in Mexico's
been cleared.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.232
Now, I don't know
who he paid off,

22:01.276 --> 22:03.234
but he's a free man
south of the border.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.932
What about
his Interpol charges?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.455
The whole reason he was
hiding out in Mexico

22:06.499 --> 22:08.239
- was to avoid extradition.
- True.

22:08.283 --> 22:09.893
But until a federal warrant
comes down,

22:09.937 --> 22:11.460
LAPD can't touch him.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.680
The man kidnapped
two of our officers, Commander.

22:13.723 --> 22:14.768
Well, there's nothing
tying Novak to that

22:14.811 --> 22:15.899
besides your suspicion, Hondo.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.640
Now, look,

22:17.684 --> 22:19.381
I'm working
on getting the warrant.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.643
I just need you to sit tight.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.210
I-I can't "sit tight"

22:22.253 --> 22:23.385
when two people are in danger
because of me.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.691
You don't have a choice.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.257
I'm pulling you
out of the field.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.694
As of right now, you're
officially benched.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.173
I don't want you
leaving the building.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.697
The chief cleared me.
You can't do this!

22:30.740 --> 22:32.263
You ran, Hondo!

22:32.307 --> 22:34.831
The chief and the commission
are furious!

22:34.875 --> 22:37.573
You're lucky that's
all I'm doing is benching you.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.054
It wasn't that simple.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.751
I know.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.579
I'm on your side.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.755
I just need you
to sit tight

22:45.799 --> 22:48.845
until this thing's over,
all right?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.159
Hello?

22:58.202 --> 23:00.596
Has your day
turned a corner, Hondo?

23:00.640 --> 23:03.643
Where's Lumbard and Birch,
you son of a bitch?

23:03.686 --> 23:05.993
Mind your temper when speaking
to me.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.125
You shouldn't be
so hostile with the man

23:08.169 --> 23:10.040
holding their lives in his hand.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.000
- So they are alive?
- Yes.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.524
A little thirsty, but breathing.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.744
Look, you want to come
at me, then come at me.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.441
But leave those officers
out of this.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.096
Your savior complex runs deep,
doesn't it?

23:22.139 --> 23:24.751
You want to be a hero
to everyone.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.448
All communities.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.972
Black and blue.

23:29.016 --> 23:31.584
Shame no one will trust you
after this morning.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.760
I've been cleared of everything
that was on your damn deepfake.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.457
Doesn't matter much, does it?

23:35.501 --> 23:37.807
The first headline
always lives on,

23:37.851 --> 23:39.853
well past a retraction.

23:39.896 --> 23:42.290
Your name's been sullied.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.640
You'll always be viewed skeptically,

23:44.684 --> 23:46.512
suspiciously from now on.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.427
Well, I guess you got
what you wanted then.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.211
You don't need
Lumbard and Birch.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.169
I have so much more to take.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.997
I rotted in that hellhole

23:54.041 --> 23:56.739
for six long months
planning this.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.350
Your reputation is
just the start.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.659
You took my son
and my freedom from me,

24:03.703 --> 24:05.966
and I won't stop

24:06.009 --> 24:09.273
until I've taken away
everything you love.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.239
I was rewatching the raw
footage and found something.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.633
A reflection
in the camera's side mirror.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.722
I think they accidentally
captured a sign

24:22.765 --> 24:24.027
wherever they filmed this.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.159
So it was edited
out of the deepfake,

24:25.202 --> 24:27.248
but...

24:33.733 --> 24:36.083
Skilling Electric--
it's a defunct power plant.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.954
It's been abandoned for years.
Perfect place to lay low.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.522
Could Novak and Kulpa still be
there with Lumbard and Birch?

24:40.566 --> 24:41.915
With every cop in the city
looking for 'em?

24:41.958 --> 24:43.525
Makes sense
to stay in one place.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.745
Okay, I'll call Deac. Let's
go find those officers, man.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.924
Baby, hey.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.060
Does this mean...?I'm good.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.672
We're good, at least as far
as the police are concerned.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.849
They treat you
all right downtown?

25:02.892 --> 25:04.851
They stuck me
in a room like this,

25:04.894 --> 25:06.548
left me alone
for the most part.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.550
But don't worry about me.
Are you okay?

25:08.594 --> 25:10.770
No, not really.

25:10.813 --> 25:12.380
Arthur Novak is in L.A.

25:12.423 --> 25:13.860
He's the one who set me up.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.340
Novak? From Mexico?

25:16.384 --> 25:17.994
Some kind of vendetta.
He told me

25:18.038 --> 25:19.561
he wants to hurt
the people I love.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.302
That's why you had me
brought here.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.999
Yeah, thankfully,
my mom and pops

25:23.043 --> 25:24.566
are out of town right now,
and Darryl's staying

25:24.610 --> 25:26.307
with Leroy just to be safe.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.135
Hopefully this all ends soon.

25:28.178 --> 25:29.658
My team's out chasing
a lead right now.

25:29.702 --> 25:30.833
Why aren't you with them?

25:31.878 --> 25:33.532
Because I'm benched.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.490
And maybe I deserve it--
I chose to run.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.840
- I chose to keep Novak a secret.
- You told me.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.581
- That meant something.
- But just you.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.018
Not my squad. This was
supposed to stay down there.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.412
I thought it was finished,
and I was wrong.

25:44.455 --> 25:45.848
You are putting
a lot of blame on yourself

25:45.892 --> 25:47.720
for something
a bad man is doing to you.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.591
I know you're Superman,

25:49.635 --> 25:51.680
but you can't always take on
all of the burden yourself.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.769
That's the responsibility that
comes with being a team leader.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.424
<i>Team</i> leader.
You know better than anyone

25:56.467 --> 25:58.948
that SWAT isn't
about any one person.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.430
Lean on the people
around you.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.432
I love that you're open with me,

26:04.475 --> 26:06.739
but you also need to be open
with your team.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.089
They're your family, too.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.528
Novak wasn't talking
about you or my family

26:13.572 --> 26:15.530
when he said he was gonna go
after the people I love.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.968
Nichelle, I got to call Deacon.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.912
This is the car
from the deepfake.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.479
Blood all over the back seat.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.612
This must be what they brought
Lumbard and Birch in.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.309
Doesn't mean they
didn't leave.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.440
All right,
perimeter's clear.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.181
Let's check inside.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.795
It's a trap!

27:07.626 --> 27:08.801
Luca!

27:14.545 --> 27:17.331
Let me see, let me see!

27:17.374 --> 27:19.246
- Bullet didn't go through.
- I'm okay.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.769
We can't stay here.
We need better cover.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.379
They left this car
for us to find

27:22.423 --> 27:23.903
in the best spot to pin us down.
There's nowhere to go!

27:26.166 --> 27:27.689
That garage door.
That's our target.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.299
We'll use the car as cover.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.388
Tan, Street, you stay on
the bumper. Luca, you good?

27:31.432 --> 27:32.825
Yeah, I'm good.
You and Chris with me

27:32.868 --> 27:34.304
on the passenger-side
door. Let's move!

27:34.348 --> 27:35.436
Yeah. Go! Go!

27:42.312 --> 27:44.053
Luca, you stay low.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.664
Keep your head down.
We're getting you out of here.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.540
On my call. Push!

28:11.777 --> 28:13.213
The shots were coming
from the roof.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.132
I see movement.
They're on the run!

28:19.175 --> 28:20.742
Go after those shooters.
I'll stay with Luca,

28:20.786 --> 28:21.917
call for backup.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.704
LAPD! Don't move!

28:28.489 --> 28:30.317
Last man.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.372
They're headed for the exit!

28:52.992 --> 28:54.515
No!

28:59.302 --> 29:00.608
- 26-
- David.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.784
The shooters got away.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.617
How's Luca?
He's fine.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.054
- Just a bad bruise.
- This was Novak's plan.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.013
He left that clue in the mirror
for us to find,

29:14.056 --> 29:16.102
knowing I would get benched
and be forced to watch him

29:16.145 --> 29:18.626
ambush my team
- from the sidelines.
- Yeah, but we got one up on him.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.280
- We're all okay.
- For now.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.847
Novak's still out there,
and I'm done waiting

29:21.890 --> 29:23.457
- for his next move.
- You're gonna have to.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.502
You're not allowed to leave HQ.I don't care.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.766
Nobody else needs to get hurt
- because of my mistakes.
- Hondo.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.116
Try and stop me, Deacon.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.903
Hey, Hondo? Hondo, Hondo.
Think about it. Think about it.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.427
This is exactly
what Novak wants you to do.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.473
Get out of my way, Street.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.695
I know you won't
walk out that door.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.349
Novak may want
you to go rogue,

29:46.393 --> 29:47.437
but that's 'cause
he doesn't know

29:47.481 --> 29:49.091
how good a cop you are.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.839
I said that to you
once upon a time, didn't I?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.667
Right after I found
my brother dead.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.712
I was ready to burn down
half of Long Beach,

30:01.756 --> 30:03.236
but you stopped me.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.847
Hondo,

30:05.891 --> 30:09.372
I have watched Novak
get to you all day.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.287
Now, I know that you're mad,

30:11.331 --> 30:13.899
but you are smarter than him.

30:13.942 --> 30:17.032
Show Novak
that he doesn't know you,

30:17.076 --> 30:19.556
that you cannot be manipulated.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.647
Hondo, talk to us.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.089
I should've told everyone
about Novak.

30:31.481 --> 30:33.222
Truth is,

30:33.266 --> 30:35.311
I still regret taking off
in the first place,

30:35.355 --> 30:37.400
but I thought
I needed to be alone.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.404
But when I was
at my lowest point...

30:42.928 --> 30:45.017
...I just wished that all of you
were down there with me

30:45.060 --> 30:46.496
to have my back.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.325
I told you
we'd always have your back.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.894
We were there for you
this morning,

30:52.938 --> 30:54.722
and we're still here for you
right now.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.725
- Can't stop 20-
- Squad.

30:57.768 --> 31:00.467
And Novak is about
to find that out the hard way.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.338
Street, you said that Novak

31:02.382 --> 31:04.427
would probably want me
to take off on my own.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.344
Let's give him what he wants.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.216
I got an idea.

31:10.259 --> 31:13.045
Federal warrant for Arthur Novak
has been approved.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.003
Wow, that was quick.
Thanks, Commander.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.005
Oh, I got to scream
at an FBI director.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.746
- No thanks necessary.
- Hmm.

31:18.789 --> 31:19.834
You ready?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.880
Yeah.
Okay.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.713
This is an unexpected surprise.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.802
First you take a shot
at my name,

31:31.846 --> 31:32.934
and then you take
shots at my team.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.327
I'm done with your games, Novak.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.763
Why don't you quit
being a coward

31:35.806 --> 31:37.069
and just take your shot
at me already?

31:37.112 --> 31:38.635
What's your hurry?

31:38.679 --> 31:41.638
Your team dodged a bullet. Impressive.

31:41.682 --> 31:45.207
But now it's my turn
to make the next move,

31:45.251 --> 31:48.167
and I plan to take my time
executing it.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.082
Time's the one thing
you don't have.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.606
A warrant's just been green-lit
for your arrest on U.S. soil,

31:52.649 --> 31:55.304
so right now every airport
and checkpoint in the state

31:55.348 --> 31:56.958
is getting a copy
of your face.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.742
You've overstayed
your welcome.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.527
So, any chance you had
of slipping out of this country

32:00.570 --> 32:01.615
has vanished.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.791
This is valuable information.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.185
No doubt
you want something in return.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.056
Lumbard and Birch.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.102
This isn't about them.
It never was.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.495
Still trying to be a hero.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.280
So predictable.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.064
So,

32:16.108 --> 32:17.718
what do you propose?

32:17.761 --> 32:19.241
A trade.

32:19.285 --> 32:21.940
The officers for a way out.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.811
You name the location.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.769
You bring me
Lumbard and Birch alive,

32:25.813 --> 32:28.120
and I'll drive you
across the border myself.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.905
You're safe in Mexico.
Live to fight another day.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.907
It's tempting.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.432
But I think we're past the point
of trusting each other.

32:36.476 --> 32:37.956
Novak, all that matters to me

32:37.999 --> 32:39.435
is getting
those officers home safe.

32:39.479 --> 32:42.525
You've done your damage, man.
You ruined my rep.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.788
Is burying me really worth
going back to prison

32:44.832 --> 32:46.094
for the rest of your life?

32:52.100 --> 32:54.015
I'll text you an address

32:54.059 --> 32:56.539
and bring the boys in blue.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.021
Meet me there in an hour.

33:00.065 --> 33:03.024
Come unarmed. And, Hondo,

33:03.068 --> 33:04.504
if you're not alone,

33:04.547 --> 33:07.550
I'll put a bullet
in both of their brains

33:07.594 --> 33:09.596
without hesitation.

33:09.639 --> 33:12.512
Novak, we started this thing,
just the two of us.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.601
I'm-a finish it
the same way.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.953
How'd you know Novak
would take the bait?

33:18.997 --> 33:21.477
'Cause once he gets me alone,
he's gonna kill me.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.002
That's been his plan
the entire time.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.483
Whose idea was it
to send Hondo unarmed

33:27.527 --> 33:29.485
without comms
or tracking of any kind?

33:29.529 --> 33:33.185
His. We can't risk having Novak
sweep Hondo for bugs.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.751
If he finds out
what we're planning,

33:34.795 --> 33:36.057
first he'll kill Hondo,
and then he'll kill

33:36.101 --> 33:37.537
- Lumbard and Birch.
- TAN:Luca,

33:37.580 --> 33:38.973
you sure you're up for this?
Oh, I've had

33:39.017 --> 33:40.366
bigger bruises
wrestling with Terry as a kid.

33:40.409 --> 33:43.064
No way I'm skipping
the chance to help Hondo.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.558
What the hell's going on?
Where's Novak?

33:58.601 --> 34:01.300
- Where's Lumbard and Birch?
- Arthur is a very careful man.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.432
- You have fooled him once before.
- He said

34:03.476 --> 34:05.956
he was gonna meet me here.
- We had a deal.
- The deal still holds.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.742
We're just rendezvousing
at a different location.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.745
If you want to see
those officers alive,

34:11.788 --> 34:13.268
you'll get in.

34:54.962 --> 34:57.573
Where's Lumbard and Birch?

34:58.618 --> 35:00.141
As you can see,

35:00.185 --> 35:03.057
I found my own way
out of the country.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.407
Suppose that means
our deal is off.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.844
I don't need you after all.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.552
You killed my son, Daniel.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.250
This is how
it was always going to end.

35:22.294 --> 35:25.732
I didn't come all this way
not to avenge my boy.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.430
But first?

35:43.706 --> 35:46.144
I want to see you suffer
one last time.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.846
And you call me predictable,
Novak?

35:52.889 --> 35:55.196
I knew there was no way
you were gonna leave

35:55.240 --> 35:56.763
without your pound
of flesh.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.591
And I also knew
about this airstrip.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.245
It took some digging,

36:00.288 --> 36:01.724
but did you know
that your boy Pasha

36:01.768 --> 36:03.204
used to run drugs out of here?

36:03.248 --> 36:05.250
So I figured if you were gonna
kill me and bounce,

36:05.293 --> 36:06.816
this is where it would be.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.383
But that's why my team
headed straight over here

36:08.427 --> 36:09.602
after our phone call.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.953
All they needed to move in
were those missing officers.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.172
Well, that...

36:27.141 --> 36:28.577
Go. Go, go.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.191
It's Lumbard and Birch.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.193
Street, Tan,
lay us some cover fire.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.503
We're getting
- you guys out of here!
- Let's go.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.592
Come on. Get over here. Come on.

36:45.942 --> 36:48.380
Arthur! What are you doing?

36:48.423 --> 36:49.859
Getting myself

36:49.903 --> 36:51.557
out of here!

36:57.171 --> 36:58.303
Novak's on the move.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.479
Drop your weapons!

37:39.996 --> 37:41.389
It's over, Novak.

37:43.043 --> 37:46.002
I can still finish
what I came here to do.

37:46.046 --> 37:48.309
Nah, I don't think you can.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.006
It'll never happen.

37:52.226 --> 37:55.360
They'll drop you before you even
get close to raising that gun.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.019
All right.
You know how this goes.

38:03.063 --> 38:06.284
Arthur Novak,
you're under arrest.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.851
If you couldn't beat me
one-on-one in Mexico,

38:08.895 --> 38:10.636
how the hell did you
think you could do it

38:10.679 --> 38:12.028
with my team behind me?

38:24.954 --> 38:27.130
Nichelle.

38:29.263 --> 38:30.351
Hey.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.837
Baby, we're safe.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.056
Novak's gonna answer
for decades of crime.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.928
We never have to
see him again.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.974
Today was different, Hondo.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.368
I know the realities
of your job,

38:47.412 --> 38:48.891
but today...

38:50.415 --> 38:52.504
Today was the first time

38:52.547 --> 38:54.506
you walked out that door
and I worried

38:54.549 --> 38:56.682
it'd be the last time I saw you.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.512
I know.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.166
And I'm sorry, Nichelle.
I'm so sorry.

39:04.559 --> 39:07.954
But I can't tell you
you won't feel this way again.

39:07.997 --> 39:11.044
It's the one promise
I can never make you.

39:12.611 --> 39:15.135
Does that make you
rethink anything

39:15.178 --> 39:17.572
about starting
a family together?

39:19.008 --> 39:21.402
Do you think I'd let
that stupid son of a bitch

39:21.446 --> 39:22.838
get what he wants?

39:22.882 --> 39:24.753
I ain't going nowhere.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.408
I love you so much.

39:31.847 --> 39:34.459
I just wanted to clear the
air before you went home.

39:34.502 --> 39:35.851
It goes without saying,

39:35.895 --> 39:38.114
but you've been restored
to active duty.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.203
- I'm sorry for what went down.
- I just want to put

39:40.247 --> 39:42.554
- this whole mess behind me.
- You know I had to bench you.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.469
If you crossed paths
with one overzealous rookie

39:44.512 --> 39:45.992
who missed the memo
about the deepfake...

39:46.035 --> 39:47.602
- Sure. I get it.
- Yeah.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.604
Novak knew I would run.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.214
He counted on it.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.347
- Mm-hmm.
- Sir, I am sorry

39:53.391 --> 39:55.305
that I didn't trust you enough
- to come in.
- I'm not gonna pretend

39:55.349 --> 39:56.916
that I understand
what it felt like

39:56.959 --> 39:58.700
to be in your shoes
at that moment.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.920
But the next time
you're framed for murder

40:00.963 --> 40:03.009
and your commander calls,

40:03.052 --> 40:05.446
pick up the damn phone.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.187
Deal.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.457
What's all this?

40:16.501 --> 40:18.067
I know you ain't waiting on me
to go home.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.591
Well, after
everything today,

40:19.634 --> 40:21.462
we thought
- you might need a beer.
- I know I do.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.377
- Luca and I got a full fridge.
- Yeah.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.639
It's been forever
since the whole squad's

40:24.683 --> 40:26.989
hung out.
What do you say, Hondo?

40:30.950 --> 40:32.952
You guys saved my life today.
You know that?

40:34.519 --> 40:36.912
You had my back from the moment
this thing went down.

40:36.956 --> 40:39.349
You risked your jobs
and your lives all for me.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.090
Come on, boss. It
was nothing, man.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.570
Nah.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.616
It's not nothing, Luca.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.489
Every one of you stepped up
without ever doubting me.

40:48.533 --> 40:49.838
The only reason

40:49.882 --> 40:51.144
I survived is because I had

40:51.187 --> 40:52.493
this group of officers
behind me.

40:52.537 --> 40:53.842
And you always will.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.583
That's right.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.759
There's no one else
we'd rather follow into a fight.

40:57.803 --> 40:58.847
CHRIS:Yeah.

40:58.891 --> 41:00.153
We'll follow you anywhere.

41:00.196 --> 41:02.590
- That's what 20-
- Squad's all about.

41:07.639 --> 41:10.859
Just know how much
I appreciate all of you.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.775
All right.

41:13.819 --> 41:15.168
Enough of the kumbaya.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.909
Hell yeah. Let's get changed
and go get some drinks.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.867
- Let's do it!
- Hey, unless you're driving me home,

41:18.911 --> 41:20.956
I'm gonna need
- Annie's keys back.
- Oh, that's right.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.306
I'm so sorry, but I've been
waiting here all day.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.352
I only need one photo
for the LAPD website.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.007
Can we please
- just get this over with?
- I got shot today,

41:28.050 --> 41:29.704
- so I'm not good.
- Yeah, I got to pick up my wife and kids.

41:29.748 --> 41:32.185
More plans tonight... Yeah, I'm not photo-ready.

41:32.228 --> 41:34.535
Ice bath again.
- I got to do it every day.
- Guys, guys, guys. Nah, nah, nah.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.581
Not this time.
Let's give her a break. Come on.

41:36.624 --> 41:37.669
Let's show this city

41:37.712 --> 41:38.713
what the best SWAT team

41:38.757 --> 41:39.758
in the LAPD looks like.

41:39.801 --> 41:40.889
Three, two, one.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.325
Everyone say "Roll SWAT"!

41:42.369 --> 41:43.805
Roll SWAT!
