00:39.831 --> 00:41.249
Kareem Abdul-
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.420
-Cap?
-Come on!

00:49.340 --> 00:51.259
-Easy. Jack, hurry it up.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.969
Chick
Fourth quarter of
this rubber game five,

00:53.052 --> 00:54.929
and the Lakers, who were
looking spectacular

00:55.013 --> 00:56.765
on the strength of
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's

00:56.848 --> 00:58.266
stellar performance,
are now shell-shocked

00:58.349 --> 01:00.310
and, friends,
they're playing like it.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.103
The 76ers staging
a furious comeback here

01:02.187 --> 01:04.522
since Kareem went down at
the end of the third quarter,

01:04.606 --> 01:06.691
taking their first
lead of the second half.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.903
They're controlling the pace,
they're killing us inside.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.237
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. I'm fine.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.989
Tape it up!
I'll play! Let's go!

01:13.072 --> 01:14.949
Leave him alone!

01:15.033 --> 01:16.534
-Tape it up!
-Don't you
touch that tape!

01:16.618 --> 01:18.870
No, she's right.
We need to get him
across the street

01:18.953 --> 01:21.456
-for an X-ray right now.
-Give him
a shot or something.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.917
-He's carrying us out there.
-Pat,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.628
if that ankle is broken
and he plays on it,

01:26.711 --> 01:27.837
it's gonna end his career.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.007
Hey, could we have
a minute here, please?

01:31.090 --> 01:34.427
-Pat
We gotta do something.
-Get the fuck out! Get out!

01:38.681 --> 01:39.808
I'm proud of you.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.060
You are more connected
than you've ever been,

01:42.143 --> 01:45.104
and that is
a beautiful thing.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.232
But you don't have to run
your body to the ground

01:47.315 --> 01:48.399
just for a game.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.568
Hey. It's only basketball.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.739
Not this time.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.076
-I want this.
-Say it louder.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.955
I want it!

02:02.038 --> 02:03.998
Six minutes to go
in the fourth quarter.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.500
Lakers down by 11,
and Kareem

02:05.583 --> 02:08.419
is back on the court,
playing with ferocity.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.464
Let's go, Lakers!

02:11.548 --> 02:13.925
It's good! And what
a great sign that is

02:14.008 --> 02:15.718
for the Lakers.
Cheeks out ahead,

02:15.802 --> 02:18.471
splits the defenders,
but Kareem is
running in on defense.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.598
And Kareem with the block!

02:20.682 --> 02:21.808
Taking it the other way.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.060
Kareem is in the post,
triple-teamed...

02:24.143 --> 02:26.396
Oh my! You're gonna
need a lot more Sixers

02:26.479 --> 02:28.356
to stop the big man tonight.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.066
-Slam dunk!
-Aah!

02:30.149 --> 02:32.026
-And just like that, the
Lakers are back in it, folks.
-Yes!

02:32.110 --> 02:34.612
And Kareem's ankle may be
hurting him but, oh Lord,

02:34.696 --> 02:36.489
he is showing no
sign of it tonight.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.074
-Under a minute now,

02:38.157 --> 02:40.702
Sixers watching this one
slip-sliding away.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.916
-Lakers win! Lakers win!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.168
And now, they'll head
back to Philadelphia

02:49.252 --> 02:50.587
with a three-games-to-two lead.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.131
And they are just
one game away from glory.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.717
Folks, you are looking at
the children of destiny.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.176
And just when things
looked bleak,

02:57.260 --> 02:59.888
the captain returns
to save his team.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.931
Earvin
Bring it here, baby,
bring it here!

03:02.015 --> 03:04.642
-You a monster, Cap!

03:04.726 --> 03:06.936
-One more!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.981
Earvin, I'm going
to need your help.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.108
Oh, shit.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.360
Abdul-
Fuck, I'm really hurt.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.070
Yeah, I got you.

The organization now saying

04:50.373 --> 04:51.833
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
is questionable

04:51.916 --> 04:53.626
for Game six in Philadelphia.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.132
Jerry
Remember I was telling you
a while ago about swans?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.720
About how they do
all the hard work

05:03.803 --> 05:05.847
of paddling below the surface?

05:08.016 --> 05:11.227
Well, it's funny. There's
something else about them.

05:11.310 --> 05:16.566
The one and only time in
their entire lives they sing...

05:16.649 --> 05:18.901
is right before they die.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.030
Their swan song.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.532
It's true.
Up until then,

05:24.615 --> 05:27.994
it's nothing but ugly squawks
and honks, but then,

05:28.077 --> 05:30.455
right at the very end...

05:31.456 --> 05:33.499
they make something beautiful.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.128
-Music.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.298
-Frank
Are you alright in there?
-Yeah.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.842
Oof! You look greener
than goose shit.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.135
Thanks, Frank.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.888
Good to see you, too.
Claire.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.140
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.768
What, you mean Kareem?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.686
Well, him, too.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.564
We're gonna close it out
in Philly tomorrow. Watch.

05:56.647 --> 06:00.068
Just please don't tell me
I'm about to lose my shirt.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.360
Or mine.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.445
Uh, not this time.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.238
Playoff revenues
exceeded our projections,

06:04.322 --> 06:07.784
and next-year
season ticket sales
are off the charts.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.410
Jackpot!

06:09.494 --> 06:11.746
Now, let's go pay those
bastards off and breathe.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.748
Great work, Claire.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.708
We just need a signature.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.251
Yep.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.212
Claire
Not yours.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.089
Your treasurer.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.509
Until you appoint someone new,

06:24.592 --> 06:26.803
we can't make anything
official with the bank.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.933
Got it. Understood, ahem.
Thank you, Claire.
I'm gonna...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.937
-get right on that.
-Of course. Thank you.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.858
So who you thinkin'?

06:43.277 --> 06:46.114
Hey, Jean Bean.
There you are. Get that door?

06:46.197 --> 06:48.950
Got something I wanna
pick your brain about.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.119
Spent all night at Grandma's.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.620
Sorting through her things.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.747
I really appreciate
you doing that.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.707
You're a good girl.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.168
Jeanie
You know, I was thinking...

06:59.252 --> 07:01.921
I don't need to go
to Philadelphia with you.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.799
I can just stay here in town
and get Grandma's things

07:04.882 --> 07:07.009
squared away before
you come back.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.637
Just so you don't
have to worry about it.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.556
I mean, it'd be a bummer
to miss the game, but--

07:11.639 --> 07:12.807
Would you do that?

07:14.183 --> 07:16.394
I could not
do that right now.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.646
Sure. Yeah, of course.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.691
-I mean, probably be game seven.

07:21.774 --> 07:25.069
Well, not if we're lucky.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.654
I tell you, Jeanie,
it was so nice

07:26.737 --> 07:29.115
seeing you with your brothers
at the funeral.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.162
Just having the whole family
together like that was...

07:41.252 --> 07:43.045
Here's the thing.

07:45.464 --> 07:48.885
We have a seat that's
opened up at the company,

07:48.968 --> 07:51.637
and it was your grandma's seat.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.223
Treasurer, and...

07:57.810 --> 08:00.146
I need your help, Jeanie.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.151
Of course, Dad.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.112
I need you to take those
two brothers of yours

08:08.196 --> 08:10.323
around this office,

08:10.406 --> 08:12.533
and see how they spark to it.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.577
You know, and then tell me

08:14.660 --> 08:17.246
who you think would be
the better pick.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.586
'Cause, you know,
what's the point of
having a family business

08:23.669 --> 08:26.464
if we don't get some family
in here, you know?

08:28.090 --> 08:29.967
Yeah.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.514
Yeah, right.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.483
They just get so weird
around me and competitive...

Sports Host
In a decision that should
delight fans across the nation,

08:50.154 --> 08:52.240
the NBA today has
selected Larry Bird

08:52.323 --> 08:54.575
of the Boston Celtics
Rookie of the Year,

08:54.659 --> 08:57.578
beating out the year's
other rookie sensation,
Magic Johnson,

08:57.662 --> 09:00.915
-who currently finds him--

09:00.998 --> 09:03.960
-Rule number one, fucker.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.171
If you're thinking
you ain't up to it,
you ain't.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.883
Ooh... Big tube.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.469
Bet I look good on that.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.721
Won't be on there tomorrow.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.224
Be me up there,
winning me a ring.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.600
Don't matter none.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.560
Ain't against me,
nobody gives a shit.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.645
Says who?

09:22.728 --> 09:25.606
I'm in your head, ain't I?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.692
Ah...

09:27.775 --> 09:29.443
-I get your ass next year.
-Nope.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.822
If you actually believed that,
I wouldn't be here.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.283
-Nice try, though.
-Man, fuck off.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.784
Larry
Make me.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.619
Except you can't, can you?

09:38.703 --> 09:39.954
'Cause I'm better than you.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.415
Better player.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.624
Better man.

09:43.708 --> 09:47.086
-I know that's right.
-Got that right.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.838
-You a asshole.
-At least I'm real.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.298
Mm-hmm.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.925
Mm-hmm? Fuck you.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.635
Fuck you. Fuck all y'all.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.345
I ain't believing
none of this shit!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.514
You just fucking with my mom,
playing tricks and shit!

09:58.597 --> 10:00.558
I'ma go out there and win
me a ring! And you ain't!

10:00.641 --> 10:03.436
None of y'all gonna
be nowhere close!

With Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
questionable

10:10.067 --> 10:11.319
for game six in Philadelphia,

10:11.402 --> 10:13.696
the rookie sensation
Magic Johnson may find...

10:13.779 --> 10:16.115
There's the motherfucker
we take out first.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.326
...considerably
under-manned...

10:18.409 --> 10:19.910
Put that shit down!

10:19.994 --> 10:22.413
And put on some
motherfucking pants!

10:22.496 --> 10:24.081
Ain't y'all junkies

10:26.417 --> 10:27.752
Kareem is out for game six.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.837
That mean the Lakers gonna
need theyself a big man.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.049
I got my agent reaching out
to Westhead and them right now.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.175
So, clean this place up,

10:34.258 --> 10:35.843
and get your asses
the fuck outta here.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.053
I got to get my shit packed.

Here we go! Here we go!
That's them.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.352

Turn it off.

...not to mention
minus Jabbar--

10:49.607 --> 10:51.650
-This is Spencer.
-Agent
Hiya, Spence! Listen.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.194
I, uh, I got bad news.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.196
I talked to the Lakers,
and, uh...

10:55.279 --> 10:56.530
They're not interested.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.574
And you, and you
talked to him yourself?

10:58.657 --> 11:01.327
-Westhead?
-Yeah, it was him.
You know,

11:01.410 --> 11:04.538
he says-- he says you're not
the right fit right now.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.624
-I hear.
-But listen, I'm gonna
keep on pushing him,

11:06.707 --> 11:08.834
and, uh, you just sit
tight there, okay?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.586
We good.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.840
So, you-you back on
the team or what?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.594
The hit is on.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.971
We'll ice those motherfuckers
when they're back from Philly.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.139
Oh, hell yeah!

11:22.223 --> 11:24.141
You're here for
Paul Westhead, right?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.602
-Yes.
-Okay. That's me.

11:27.686 --> 11:30.147
-Go get 'em. Okay?
-I will.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.399
Thanks.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.443
I'm proud of you!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.362

11:36.445 --> 11:38.906
Jack Mc
That makes one of us.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.033
Glad I caught you
before the big trip.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.493
Jack...

11:43.786 --> 11:46.455
What are-- what are
you doing here?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.707
I brought you something.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.751
Don't worry, it won't bite.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.129
My notes on Philly.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.507
I schemed for this.
A starting five without Kareem.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.259
In case it came up.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.638
Jack...

12:06.016 --> 12:08.269
I hate how all this happened.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.355
I mean, all of it.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.608
Look, I want you to know
I-I'm leaving next year,

12:14.692 --> 12:16.402
no matter what happens.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.196
Time for me to do
my own thing, right?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.490
This is your thing.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.701
You started this.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.580
Then finish it.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.917
Besides, I don't need you
out there competing with me

12:32.001 --> 12:34.170
for a coaching job.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.629
Got some place in mind?

12:35.713 --> 12:38.299
Wherever I can come back
and kick your ass.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.553
-I can't wait.
-McGood luck!

12:43.179 --> 12:45.055
Coach.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.855
Let's go.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.982
Host 1
What's there even
to talk about?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.442
Without Kareem in the lineup,

12:56.525 --> 12:58.944
the Lakers are going to lose
this game in Philadelphia.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.490
-This series is going seven.
-HostGone-zo! Bye-bye!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.325
Host
The only question
in my mind is

13:04.408 --> 13:06.076
does Magic Johnson
have what it takes

13:06.160 --> 13:08.621
-to even make it a contest?
-HostYes, yes!

13:08.704 --> 13:11.165
This is what I've been saying!
On the money.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.125
-There's no chance--

13:21.175 --> 13:22.718
-What's up, Cheryl?
-Hi.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.887
-Where the big fella?
-He wants to talk to you.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.389
Have your driver follow me
to the parking lot.

13:33.145 --> 13:37.942
-I'll keep the hounds away.
You two can have a chat.
-Aight.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.986
What's up, Cap?
Feeling like John Shaft,

13:41.070 --> 13:43.781
you all up in here like
a spooky movie people.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.533
Yeah, figured it
was best to lay low

13:45.616 --> 13:47.117
with all those
buzzards circling.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.494
You good to go then?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.455
I'm out, Buck.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.710
Well, you heal up then.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.380
-We still may be needing
you game seven--
-Buck.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.423
I'm out.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.134
And you're the only one
who knows.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.595
For now.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.934
Damn.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.983
Look, Buck...

14:20.109 --> 14:22.236
before this season,

14:22.319 --> 14:25.573
I thought I was done with ball.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.908
Biding my time,
cashing my paycheck.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.413
Then, this kid comes along.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.873
Smiley motherfucker.
Whitest teeth you ever saw.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.836
All grins and high-up fives,
and hugs.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.548
First time he gave me one,
made my nuts draw up

14:42.631 --> 14:45.467
-tighter than a cat
inside a mouse hole.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.972
Thought you was
gonna punch me out.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.640
I wanted to.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.644
Remember what you told me

14:55.728 --> 14:58.105
when I said
we still got 81 to go?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.735
You keep on winning games,
I'm gonna give you 81 more hugs.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.247
You owe me one more.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.462
Maybe we screwed up
cuttin' Haywood.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.256
Ask me, he put a mojo
on the team 'cause
we gave him the boot.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.299
Fuck Wood, man.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.675
Had his head been on,

15:26.759 --> 15:27.843
he'd be there to back me up,

15:27.926 --> 15:29.011
instead of y'all fucking

15:29.094 --> 15:30.346
bitch-ass motherfuckers.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.348
Shit, Wood's juju probably
comin' for me next.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.183
You the big man now, buddy.
Why don't you go ahead

15:34.266 --> 15:35.684
and sit down in
the big man's seat?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.144
Jim
Hell no. When Cap find out,

15:37.227 --> 15:38.979
most likely from
your snitchin' ass,

15:39.063 --> 15:41.273
my ass end up gettin'
karate-chopped
to fuckin' death.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.691
-Fuck you.
-Fuck me?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.401
The team seems
to be in good spirits.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.236
-Heard it was a dicey practice.
-Any truth to the rumors

15:46.320 --> 15:48.155
of bringing back Haywood for
the remainder of the series?

15:48.238 --> 15:50.324
Is Kareem gonna be able to
come back for game seven?

15:50.407 --> 15:52.576
-And what if he doesn't?
-Paul Guys,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.078
we're gonna take this
one game at a time.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.914
Yeah. Who said
we need a game seven?

15:56.997 --> 15:59.041
-Have a drink, relax.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.418
-We'll talk after
the flight. Yep.
-How is Nixon's finger?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.045
-Love you guys. Love you.
-Thanks.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.339
Flight
...drinks service
will begin shortly.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.924
Well, I guess, uh,

16:07.007 --> 16:10.719
if we lose, at least we did
that on our own, huh?

16:10.803 --> 16:13.347
Won't give Jack any credit.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.558
-Ain't over yet.
-Aight, all you
peoples, listen up!

16:22.439 --> 16:25.526
-Someone take that thing
away from him.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.115
You sound like a dying bird.
Nigga, why you so happy?

16:31.198 --> 16:34.535
-Shit, is big man coming back?
-You lookin' at the big man
right here.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.537
-Hey, fellas.
-What?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.664
We closing out in Philly.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.249
-Me at center.
-Center?

16:40.332 --> 16:43.627
Listen, I played center
back in high school.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.505
Maybe I ain't as big as Jones
or Chocolate Thunder,

16:46.588 --> 16:47.923
but I ain't no pipsqueak.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.508
And can't neither one
of them keep up with me

16:49.591 --> 16:50.467
speed-wise neither.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.219
Ooh, I'll be spinnin'
in the post,

16:52.302 --> 16:54.304
drivin' and kickin' to Norm

16:54.388 --> 16:56.265
or Silk for the jay.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.433
-For real?
-Get the fuck outta here.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.059
Let them try
and match up with that.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.853
Yo, I ain't trying
to fuck up the party,

17:00.936 --> 17:04.273
but what six-nine guard
supposed to do against
two seven-footers?

17:04.356 --> 17:05.232
Exactly.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.609
Send they ass home to mama.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.241
Come on, Coach! What you say?

17:14.324 --> 17:16.285
We don't have time
to practice it.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.871
They won't neither, Coach.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.081
They're gonna pound us
in the paint all night.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.584
Or we can, uh,
race 'em off the court.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.961
-No way.
-Look, I-I wish we had
a better option, too,

17:26.044 --> 17:29.465
-but if we go seven
and Kareem's not back--
-"The gloomy shade of death."

17:31.341 --> 17:33.719
-That means we're fucked then.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.434
Okay.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.727
Okay?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.061
Okay.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.146
-Okay!

17:44.229 --> 17:47.608
Hey, hey, fellas.
I know 33 ain't with us,

17:48.692 --> 17:50.319
but you got 32.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.904
Now y'all have no fear.

17:51.987 --> 17:55.115
Magic motherfuckin' Johnson
be here.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.703
-There's a time...

18:01.955 --> 18:04.082
Players
When you find...

18:07.002 --> 18:08.754
Yeah, there you go!

18:15.093 --> 18:16.303
What's that?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.349
It's what Jack would do.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.354
Well, fuck.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.629
Right this way over here.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.550
Over here?
These seats blow.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.884
You know what?
This is a mind game.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.177
They're trying to
get under our skin.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.720
Just don't let 'em razzle you.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.681
-Go get yourself some beers.
-Jimmy Thank you.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.724
Johnny -
You sure? I can pay.
-David - Dr. Buss!

19:02.808 --> 19:04.476
-Man of the moment!
-David. Oh yeah.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.855
Listen, I'm sorry
to hear about Kareem.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.148
It's alright.
I like proving
the doubters wrong.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.485
Commissioner not here yet or...

19:13.569 --> 19:15.153
-Uh, stuck in traffic.
-Ah.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.698
Tell the man the truth.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.658
You'll see him
in LA on Sunday,

19:19.741 --> 19:22.786
-giving that shiny trophy
to the Sixers.
-Red!

19:23.996 --> 19:25.956
I'm touched!
You showed up as a fan?

19:26.039 --> 19:28.041
I'm just here for my award.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.418
Exec of the Year.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.502
Bill here's Coach of the Year.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.547
Hell, with Bird,
we got the Triple Crown.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.591
Wow! Isn't that something?

19:35.674 --> 19:39.011
You guys have won everything
that doesn't count!

19:39.094 --> 19:40.470
For now.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.930
You boys enjoy your popcorn.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.558
Yeah. Enjoy your plaque!

19:44.641 --> 19:45.809
I'll see you, David.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.352
-Got you a beer, Dad.
-Thank you, Jim.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.354
And don't sweat him, alright?
He's jealous.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.273
He's a loser.
It's not even the right sport.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.443
-Triple Crown...
-Yeah. He's miserable.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.405
-Good to see you guys!
-Yeah, you, too.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.908
-You wanna sit in the middle?
-Nah, nah. This is good.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.162
Brent Musburger
Well, here we are.

20:05.245 --> 20:08.123
Game six of the 1980
NBA World Championship,

20:08.206 --> 20:11.084
moments away,
the formidable
Philadelphia 76ers--

20:11.168 --> 20:14.463
-Narrator
And lo! The Israelites

20:14.546 --> 20:17.341
have reached
the Promised Land.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.009
Behold that land

20:19.092 --> 20:21.303
with thine eyes.
But, Moses...

20:21.386 --> 20:24.222
Come on,
let's change the channel.
It's time.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.226
-I can't, babe.
-Yes, you can.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.771
You got them there.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.648
And they need your
vibes right now.

20:36.234 --> 20:39.112
...formidable
Philadelphia 76ers

20:39.196 --> 20:42.282
versus the nimble
Los Angeles Lakers.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.159
Live from Spectrum Arena,
Philadelphia.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.286
Sparks are in the air
tonight for game six.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.289
The Lakers undermanned
but with a chance
to take it all tonight,

20:49.373 --> 20:50.999
and, folks, we now
know Coach Westhead

20:51.083 --> 20:52.626
has decided
to go small tonight.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.253
Without their big man,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

20:55.337 --> 20:57.422
Magic Johnson listed
as the starting center.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.341
He can't hope to match up
physically with the size

20:59.424 --> 21:01.843
and strength
of Darryl Dawkins
and Caldwell Jones.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.848
-Jerry.
-Oh shit. Fuck, fuck, Bill!

21:06.932 --> 21:08.642
Fucking runnin' up
on me like that for!

21:08.725 --> 21:10.060
Yeah.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.856
-Oh. Now, we're talkin'.
-Mm-hmm.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.743
They sound pretty worked up!

21:26.827 --> 21:29.579
-Just another game, right?
-Right.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.872
We got a plan, gentlemen.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.000
They may be bigger,
but we've got the speed.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.543
That means we're
pushing that ball

21:34.626 --> 21:36.211
every chance we get.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.527
This is our game.
We got here as a team.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.030
We're gonna finish as a team.
Team on three.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.740
-One, two, three! Team!
-Team!

22:04.823 --> 22:07.868
Here comes the tip...

22:09.161 --> 22:11.872
What you smiling for,
Young Blood?

22:11.955 --> 22:15.208
Just can't believe I'm about
to take a ring from Dr. J.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.339
What's up, fool?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.842
Hey, take it easy on me
in that paint!

22:25.218 --> 22:28.221
I got the tip.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.475
-What's he doing?
-Magic wants--
He wants the tip.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.435
Chones, let him in.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.936
Rook, what the fuck
you thinkin'?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.438
I be feelin', baby,
I be feelin'.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.315
And look at this.
Magic Johnson

22:38.398 --> 22:40.150
is stepping into
the center circle.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.568
The 20-year-old rookie

22:41.651 --> 22:43.278
is not just hoping to fill
the captain's shoes, Keith.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.030
He's actually gonna
jump center for it.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.074
Fuck's he doing?
What the fuck is he doing?!

22:47.157 --> 22:49.576
No! J-Jones has got
five fuckin' inches on him!

22:49.659 --> 22:51.745
Our kid's got bigger balls.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.998
I can't fuckin' watch this!
I can't. I can't. I can't.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.750
Fuckin' walk,
just fuckin' take a hike.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.628
-Hey, hey, hey!

23:03.006 --> 23:05.384
-Musburger
Well, here we are.

23:05.467 --> 23:08.053
Game six of the 1980
NBA World...

23:08.136 --> 23:10.138
Can't nothing jump
like a monkey.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.390
You'll wipe that
smile off next year.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.226
Shut the fuck up.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.646
-The ball
is in center court...

23:17.729 --> 23:18.980
He's there.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.691
I ain't.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.821
Alright...

23:28.198 --> 23:30.951
Hey, what's he
like in person?

23:31.034 --> 23:33.203
-Earleatha, right?
-Mm-hmm.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.247
-Yeah, I heard you went to MSU.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.541
I mean, you must
know Magic, right?

23:41.169 --> 23:43.004
No. Can't say I do.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.007
All I'm sayin',
the boy ain't hard enough
to play the center!

23:46.091 --> 23:47.968
-Simple as that!
-But he played center
in high school.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.803
Mr.
Tell you right now,
you wouldn't know hard

23:49.886 --> 23:51.680
if you the only dick

23:51.763 --> 23:53.140
in a hotel room full of pussy!

23:53.223 --> 23:55.725
Man, we in for a treat, y'all!

23:55.809 --> 23:56.935
Game's starting!

23:57.018 --> 23:58.812
Musburger
Do not adjust your TV.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.647
This is actually happening.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.482
-Junior's stepping up.
-Doing too much,

24:02.566 --> 24:05.026
-that's what he's doing.
-What the heck
do you know?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.862
Watch your mouth, Earl,

24:06.945 --> 24:09.364
or else you're gonna have to
watch your butt at halftime.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.866
-Ooh!
-Tell him, Mama!

24:10.949 --> 24:12.325
You heard the woman.
Now, look!

24:12.409 --> 24:13.869
Settle down.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.791
Let's go, Magic!
Let's go!

24:28.800 --> 24:30.051
Jones wins the tip.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.054
Dawkins secures it.
Tapped away by Magic.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.140
Jim Chones back to Magic
on the break.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.766
Long pass down the court.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.894
Hits Wilkes in stride,
lays it up and in.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.438
And just like that,
these Lakers take the lead.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.818
...back the other way.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.696
Long baseball pass to Hollins
for the open jumper.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.573
And flat. It's no good.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.742
Nixon with the rebound.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.410
Quick pass around the horn.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.580
Magic on the block,
pounding with the big man.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.790
Floats up a skyhook,
and it's good!

25:00.874 --> 25:03.418
Abdul-
That's my skyhook!
I taught him that!

25:03.501 --> 25:05.378
Move over, Houdini.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.673
I see you, Buck!
I taught him that! Let's go!

25:08.757 --> 25:10.842
Oh, man.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.594
The doctor makes his move.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.222
Oh, that's no good.
And Chones with the rebound
to Norm.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.182
-- Let's go!
-- Back to Magic,

25:17.265 --> 25:20.268
with a snazzy dribble!
Hits Wilkes...

25:20.352 --> 25:21.478
Slam dunk!

25:21.561 --> 25:24.064
Lakers out to
an eight-point lead.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.650
Cheeks to Erving
for the jumper.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.236
Good!
Johnson answers quickly

25:29.319 --> 25:30.737
with an offhand
layup of his own.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.031
And, friends, this Philly crowd
is getting restless.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.658
They're itching
in their seats.

25:34.741 --> 25:37.118
And that's the Doctor
with the cure.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.037
And here comes
the slug-fest.

25:44.834 --> 25:48.338
I think I, uh, might go
check on the commissioner.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.258
Jay? Call New York,

25:51.341 --> 25:53.051
get O'Brien on a helicopter.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.511
And make sure
they've got a stage

25:54.594 --> 25:56.137
in case we're giving
out a trophy.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.347
Uh, is-is there a trophy?

25:57.430 --> 25:58.974
I need a quarter.
You got a quarter?

25:59.057 --> 26:01.268
Erving under the backboard
at the baseline.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.937
-- Shit.
-- Unbelievable!

26:04.020 --> 26:07.357
And a scintillating
start for the Lakers
in that first quarter,

26:07.440 --> 26:09.067
but the Sixers
are hanging tough.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.152
This is gonna be
a doozy of a contest,
friends.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.246
Just fuckin' take it.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.040
Fucking walk in there.
Keep fucking walking...

26:28.003 --> 26:29.087
Motherfucker...

26:35.385 --> 26:37.929
This just...
fuckin' sucks.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.765
Fuck.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.896
-What is it? What happened?
What happened?
-Philly tied it up.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.232
No! Fuck!
God-fuckin'-dammit!

26:49.316 --> 26:52.277
I knew it! Fuck, I knew it!

26:52.360 --> 26:54.738
Goddammit!

26:54.821 --> 26:56.906
Under a minute to go here
in the half. A dead heat.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.992
Lakers 60, Sixers 58.

26:59.075 --> 27:03.204
Collins out ahead of
the Lakers with a clear
path at the basket.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.374
And just like that,
the teams stay knotted up.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.294
You get to sit down!
And you suck! And you suck!

27:09.377 --> 27:10.879
-Come here! Come on!
-I'll fuck you up!

27:10.962 --> 27:13.465
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.222
Norm from the corner.
No good.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.766
And it looks right now
like these Lakers

27:22.849 --> 27:24.059
have come back
down to earth.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.477
The crowd
is right back in it.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.146
Last seconds of the quarter,
Magic with the steal.

27:28.229 --> 27:31.024
-Magic from the half-court
at the buzzer.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.026
In and out!
And that may be

27:33.109 --> 27:34.694
the only place he's missed
the mark tonight.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.613
But the lead he has built
has slipped away.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.282
And you can feel
a frustration creeping in
for these Lakers.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.910
...right out the gate, but the
Sixers absorb the onslaught

27:41.993 --> 27:44.037
and come out
tied at the half.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.580
Bill
Well, you have
to ask yourself,

27:45.663 --> 27:47.374
was that Magic
and the Lakers' best shot?

27:48.833 --> 27:50.585
They're doing great.

27:50.668 --> 27:53.922
-Don't listen to that.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.465
Dr. J is here to prove

27:55.548 --> 27:57.008
that his reign
is nowhere near over.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.511
But Magic's
rookie performance
does not disappoint.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.472
And, oh look,
there's the rookie
owner of the Lakers

28:02.555 --> 28:04.682
taking in his team
with his two sons.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.477
Both chips off the old block,
I'm sure. I'll--

28:19.155 --> 28:22.117
If you're looking for the game,
you're in the wrong arena.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.870
Why aren't you in Philly?

28:25.954 --> 28:29.082
Uh, someone had to clean out
my grandmother's things, so...

28:29.165 --> 28:31.334
It's just a lot for my dad.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.422
Your brothers didn't volunteer?

28:35.505 --> 28:39.092
No. They'd just, uh,
steal the silverware.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.306
My grandma was so smart.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.184
So tough.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.478
But I think she gave
the best of it away.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.150
But I don't want to be like her.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.736
I want to be like you.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.709
You never will.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.964
You're going to be him.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.263
We have the feed up on
satellite if you want.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.851
Maude made chili.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.662
-Lon - Uh, excuse me?
-- What is it?

29:49.746 --> 29:51.539
Uh, I'm supposed to
give this to, uh, Magic.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.916
Yeah, what is it?

29:52.999 --> 29:55.001
It's the vote totals
for Rookie of the Year.

29:55.084 --> 29:56.836
He asked me to get them.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.922
He wanted to know
how much he lost by.

29:59.005 --> 30:02.008
Alright, alright.
I'll tell him myself.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.973
Alright, gentlemen, listen up.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.101
One more message from the Bard.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.480
"If we are marked to die,

30:17.106 --> 30:19.901
"we are enough

30:19.984 --> 30:22.195
"to do our country loss.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.031
"And if to live...

30:25.114 --> 30:27.325
"oh, if to live,

30:27.408 --> 30:30.245
"the fewer men,
the greater share of honor.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.747
"For he who hath

30:32.830 --> 30:37.126
"no stomach to this fight,
let him depart!

30:37.210 --> 30:40.380
"We would not die
in that man's company

30:40.463 --> 30:43.716
"that fears his fellowship
to die with us!

30:45.009 --> 30:46.344
"We few...

30:47.053 --> 30:48.596
"We happy few...

30:50.890 --> 30:53.017
We band of brothers..."

30:54.561 --> 30:55.937
Let's kill those fuckers!

30:58.064 --> 30:59.274
Alright, here we are,

30:59.357 --> 31:00.733
beginning of round two,
all knotted up.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.194
And who is going to make
this game their own?

31:03.278 --> 31:05.488
We've seen marvels
out of Magic so far,

31:05.572 --> 31:08.074
but if the Lakers want to beat
this veteran Sixers squad,

31:08.157 --> 31:11.119
he is going to have to find
a new offensive gear.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.079
Hey, it's EJ the DJ.
Watch this!

31:13.162 --> 31:15.039
Chones with the inbound
pass to Magic.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.666
Magic behind the back.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.752
Beautiful spin move.
Long pass down to Norm.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.170
Nixon with a lovely layup.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.047
And the Lakers draw
first blood out of the half.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.133
-- Yeah, y'all!
-- Magic back
in the paint now,

31:25.216 --> 31:26.801
bodying up Erving,
giving the Doctor

31:26.884 --> 31:28.511
a taste of his own medicine.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.929
Nixon to Magic.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.097
Slam dunk!

31:31.180 --> 31:33.433
Coming to you live
and direct!

31:34.559 --> 31:36.894
Magic battling for a rebound,

31:36.978 --> 31:39.355
taking it back the other way.
Fools the Doctor!

31:39.439 --> 31:41.649
Hits Norm in the corner.
Back to Magic.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.693
And Magic, eyes in
the back of his head tonight.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.695
Back to Norm, driving,
lays it up and in.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.698
and, oh my!
Time out, Sixers.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.241
You've seen Magic
at point guard,

31:50.325 --> 31:52.201
you've seen Magic at forward,
you've seen Magic at center.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.412
Pretty soon, you might
see Magic play a position

31:54.495 --> 31:56.456
that nobody's even
invented yet, Keith.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.625
Magic down the middle,
bounce pass to Jamaal.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.376
Here's Magic,
behind his back to Chones.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.587
Spies a wide-open Holland.
Swish!

32:02.670 --> 32:04.339
Magic puts 'em in
the popcorn machine.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.215
On the block,
pounding with the big man.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.843
And giving it right back
and more--

32:08.926 --> 32:10.094
Magic says, give me that ball!

32:10.178 --> 32:12.096
Put up, back it in,
by who else?

32:12.180 --> 32:15.141
Magic Johnson.
Boy, I tell you, this kid
is everywhere, folks.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.355
Lakers up 10 in the quarter,

32:20.438 --> 32:21.606
and the game all on the back

32:21.689 --> 32:23.650
of an astonishing performance
by Magic Johnson.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.777
-They are one quarter
away from a ring.
-Oh, fuck! Yes!

32:25.860 --> 32:27.320
But can he keep this up
for 12 more minutes

32:27.403 --> 32:28.905
without running out of steam?

32:28.988 --> 32:31.157
Don't! No-- Don't say
a fuckin' word, Bill!

32:31.240 --> 32:33.993
Don't! You know better!
Don't say another fuckin' word!

32:34.077 --> 32:36.245
-I'm gonna take a fucking...
-The other way!

32:36.329 --> 32:38.956
-I'm gonna take a walk!
-Yeah, you do that.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.750
It's working, Bill!

32:40.833 --> 32:43.670
And at the end of three,
it's Lakers 93...

32:43.753 --> 32:45.380
Baby, they're gonna win it!

32:45.463 --> 32:47.215
Do you want something
from the kitchen?

32:47.298 --> 32:48.758
I'm having champagne.

32:48.841 --> 32:51.469
Not only without their big man
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

32:51.552 --> 32:54.138
but also without power forward
Spencer Haywood,

32:54.222 --> 32:57.934
who was shouldering
a lot of the weight down there
in the post for this team.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.686
The Lakers
are just 12 minutes

32:59.769 --> 33:03.106
and one quarter of basketball
away from the Promised Land,

33:03.189 --> 33:06.776
their first championship
in eight years.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.904
-One, two, three...
-Team!

33:27.130 --> 33:29.215
Lakers 10 ahead with
what could become

33:29.298 --> 33:32.969
a comfortable lead if
they keep the pressure on.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.722
Sixers gotta
come out swinging,
and they do, folks.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.557
Erving with
a fast cut to the rim,

33:37.640 --> 33:39.642
reminding everyone
why he's the Doctor.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.811
And where was
Magic on that play?

33:41.894 --> 33:43.479
Erving asking
for the ball again,

33:43.563 --> 33:44.605
this time in the corner.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.566
D up! D up!

33:46.649 --> 33:49.736
Who peels Magic off
like a banana!

33:49.819 --> 33:53.740
And just like that,
the Sixers
cut this lead in half.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.409
And Magic Johnson
is looking winded, friends,

33:56.492 --> 33:59.078
like the Doctor may have
found a cure for him.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.958
Sixers have no quit in them,
I'll tell you that right now.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.461
Come on, keep
a foot on their throats.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.129
Don't let these guys back in it.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.756
Oh! And Erving
with a clean pick

34:09.839 --> 34:11.090
leaving Magic in the dust.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.258
And if you're Paul Westhead,

34:12.341 --> 34:13.926
this is exactly what
you were afraid of.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.846
He's been out there
in high gear for
every minute of this game.

34:16.929 --> 34:20.141
And even at the ripe old age
of 20, that will take a toll.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.809
Nixon trying to
muster up some offense

34:21.893 --> 34:23.478
for the struggling Lakers.
Misses badly.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.896
Jones with the rebound.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.194
You're alright! Get back!

34:31.277 --> 34:33.529
Cheeks running the break.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.115
-To Erving... Good!

34:36.199 --> 34:38.493
And the Sixers have
cut this deficit to one.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.994
I'll tell ya, these
Lakers are starting

34:40.077 --> 34:42.663
to look like a car
without an engine.

34:44.832 --> 34:47.585
Just over three minutes
and 30 seconds to go
in this game.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.545
Lakers clinging to
a three-point advantage,

34:49.629 --> 34:51.631
Magic Johnson has
been carrying the team,

34:51.714 --> 34:54.133
but now he's looking like it,
friends, walking this ball

34:54.217 --> 34:55.760
up the court
just to get some air.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.011
And he walks
right into a trap!

34:57.094 --> 34:59.055
Dawkins, Hollins,
Cheeks surrounding him.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.850
Magic throws the ball away...

35:02.934 --> 35:06.187
-Goddammit!
-right into the hands
of Julius Erving!

35:06.270 --> 35:09.148
And just like that, the Sixers
trail by only one point.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.403
-God, they're--
-The crowd
is going wild

35:14.487 --> 35:17.073
and now, they can taste it.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.699
Magic Johnson looking tired,

35:18.783 --> 35:21.661
looking absolutely exhausted
out there, and frustrated.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.163
-Let's just hope not beaten.
Time out, Lakers!

35:28.084 --> 35:29.710
Did you call that time out?

35:29.794 --> 35:31.337
No. He did.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.635
Time out, Lakers.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.262
-Sorry, I know.
-No, no, no, no, no.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.555
Fuck that, fuck that.
We got this.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.765
Ain't got nothing left.
I'm spent, Norm.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.393
You ain't alone, Buck, okay?

35:45.476 --> 35:46.602
Hey. Fucking look at me.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.062
You've been doin'
everything out here,

35:48.145 --> 35:49.897
but we got you.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.567
I got you.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.861
Let's go and win
this fucking game.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.320
-Okay? Yeah? Alright.
-Yeah.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.864
Let's go. Let's take it home.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.199
Magic has played
every minute here tonight,

36:00.283 --> 36:01.701
and he looks out of gas.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.286
We've been
wondering all year

36:03.369 --> 36:05.913
when this kid was
gonna hit the wall.
This may be it.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.874
It's looking more and more
like it's gonna take

36:07.957 --> 36:09.917
-a lot more than magic.
-You can say that--

36:10.001 --> 36:11.419
And I'll tell ya,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.087
these guys look like
they've been in a war,

36:13.170 --> 36:16.007
the two of them.
This whole team is exhausted.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.926
Nixon...
He's got stones for legs,

36:19.010 --> 36:21.345
and Nixon bringing him
over back to the bench,

36:21.429 --> 36:22.889
and he is tired,
I'll tell you.

36:22.972 --> 36:24.557
Magic has had
an amazing night,

36:24.640 --> 36:25.975
spectacular performance,

36:26.058 --> 36:27.351
but when push comes to shoves

36:27.435 --> 36:28.895
in these
high-pressure situations,

36:28.978 --> 36:30.229
you want experience
driving the team

36:30.313 --> 36:32.064
when there's
a championship at stake.

36:32.148 --> 36:35.234
You cannot hear yourself
think in this arena.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.403
I bet they can hear this
crowd way back in LA.

36:37.486 --> 36:39.405
I'll tell ya,
if Kareem can't come back

36:39.488 --> 36:40.907
for that game seven,

36:40.990 --> 36:43.201
this could be the Lakers'
last best chance.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.295
Breathe! Breathe!
I know that we are tired!

36:54.378 --> 36:57.298
But this is what we trained for!

36:57.381 --> 37:00.009
McKinney miles, gentlemen!

37:00.092 --> 37:02.261
Okay? Two minutes!

37:02.345 --> 37:03.971
Two minutes to glory!

37:04.055 --> 37:05.973
We are gonna win this thing!

37:06.057 --> 37:10.269
We're gonna win it! Okay?
You believe that! Believe it!

37:10.353 --> 37:13.397
We finish this
together right now!

37:13.481 --> 37:14.941
Hands in!

37:15.024 --> 37:17.610
Champs on three!
One, two, three...

37:17.693 --> 37:19.195
Champs!

37:19.278 --> 37:20.613
Come on!

37:25.284 --> 37:27.203
Come on, let's do it!

37:32.124 --> 37:34.460
Sixty-three to three.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.004
What?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.801
The rookie vote.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.511
Bird won.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.846
-Sixty-three to three.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.479
Ball!

38:44.739 --> 38:46.532
Magic pushing against Erving.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.034
Cooper cutting to the basket.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.702
Magic with the alley-oop.

38:49.785 --> 38:50.911
Ooh!

38:53.622 --> 38:55.541
What the--

38:55.624 --> 38:58.794
God fucking arrest him!
That wasn't a f--

38:58.878 --> 39:00.546
That's Michael Cooper
down on the floor,

39:00.629 --> 39:02.089
and this does not look good,
I tell you.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.592
-There's Jack Curran going out.
-I won't fuckin' calm down!

39:04.675 --> 39:06.719
Not good.
Boy, I'll tell you,
he is really hurt.

39:06.802 --> 39:09.138
He may be out cold.
Team's gathered around,

39:09.221 --> 39:10.389
and this could not come,

39:10.473 --> 39:12.308
boy, this could not come
at a worse time.

39:12.391 --> 39:13.517
Coop, Coop!

39:14.351 --> 39:15.352
Fuck, man.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.273
-Jack Curran
Mike? Mike?

39:19.356 --> 39:21.358
Hey, Mike? Mike?

39:21.442 --> 39:23.611
-Do you know where you are?

39:25.863 --> 39:27.865
Home...

39:27.948 --> 39:30.284
Pasadena?

39:30.367 --> 39:32.078
Shit, Philly. Yeah.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.830
Nah, Coop. You right at home.

39:34.914 --> 39:38.084
Now, go in your living room
and sink a free throw.

39:39.418 --> 39:40.753
-Yeah?
-Okay.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.797
-Cool?
-Okay.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.300
If he's unable to
shoot this foul shot,

39:46.384 --> 39:48.135
the Sixers can pick anyone

39:48.219 --> 39:49.637
from the Lakers' bench
to shoot,

39:49.720 --> 39:52.139
including our own
hands of stone
Mark Landsberger.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.308
There you go, Coop,
there you go!

39:57.561 --> 39:58.896
Watch your toes!

40:09.657 --> 40:11.534
-Let's go!
-Come on, Coop.

40:12.284 --> 40:14.703
Sink it!

40:33.889 --> 40:36.183
Michael Cooper with
the shot of his life,

40:36.267 --> 40:38.018
and he drops it.
If he can make
the second shot,

40:38.102 --> 40:39.854
they're gonna
put up by three.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.315
Coop. There you go.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.692
Let's get this next one.
Let's go.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.152
One more! One more!

40:48.654 --> 40:50.447
Come on, Coop.

40:50.531 --> 40:53.409
And the Lakers are looking
for a little cushion here.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.369
-He's got it.
Lakers up three.
-Yes!

40:55.452 --> 40:56.871
Still a one-possession game,
- 26 left.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.373
But the Lakers can't go
celebrating too soon, Keith.

40:59.456 --> 41:01.250
Now, they've got to get
a stop right here.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.626
Back on D!

41:02.710 --> 41:04.587
Jones looking for
an open man.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.297
Norm. Norm!

41:06.380 --> 41:07.882
Finds him with
a long in-bounds pass

41:07.965 --> 41:10.301
to a wide-open Dawkins
at center court.

41:10.384 --> 41:13.387
-- Norm!
Intercepted by Norm Nixon!

41:13.471 --> 41:15.598
Go! Go! Go!

41:15.681 --> 41:17.725
Moves it quickly
up ahead to Magic!

41:19.268 --> 41:20.895
Driving to the basket...

41:21.937 --> 41:23.439
Magic muscles in.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.276
Erving rushing in
to meet him at the rim...

41:28.277 --> 41:29.945
Slam dunk!

41:33.782 --> 41:35.951
Yes! Yes!

41:36.035 --> 41:37.369
Yeah!

41:37.453 --> 41:39.663
-Yes!
-Slam dunk!

41:39.747 --> 41:41.248
Right over Julius Erving!

41:50.507 --> 41:52.426
That might be the dagger,
and the Lakers know

41:52.509 --> 41:53.636
they've got this thing won.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.055
The bench, the entire bench
is up screaming.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.604
Hey, Paul! Paul Westhead!
Give me five.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.397
There's 39 seconds
left, Chick.

42:06.232 --> 42:06.941
Oh shi--

42:09.735 --> 42:12.696
Oh! Thank you, Jesus!

42:12.780 --> 42:14.740
Gimme five! Atta baby!

42:16.951 --> 42:18.744
And this game is in
the refrigerator, friends.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.246
The door is closed.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.581
The lights are out,
the eggs are cooling,

42:22.665 --> 42:24.041
the butter's getting hard.

42:24.124 --> 42:25.626
And the Jell-O is jiggling!

42:25.709 --> 42:26.961
Young
Left corner!

42:27.044 --> 42:29.630
Right block! A, B!

42:29.713 --> 42:32.174
Earvin Johnson Sr.:
Junior! Keep your head up!

42:32.258 --> 42:33.175
Look straight ahead.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.593
Don't show him
where you wanna go.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.595
Young
Woo! Last few seconds

42:36.679 --> 42:38.514
of the fourth quarter

42:38.597 --> 42:40.683
to see which team wins.

42:40.766 --> 42:43.686
Fades left!
Goes right at the fake--

42:48.691 --> 42:51.568
And it's official!
The Lakers win

42:51.652 --> 42:54.363
the 1980 NBA
World Championship.

42:54.446 --> 42:57.950
That makes Magic Johnson,
a mere 20 years of age,

42:58.033 --> 42:59.952
the youngest champion
of all time,

43:00.035 --> 43:01.787
and, boy,
does this kid deserve

43:01.870 --> 43:04.415
to be enjoying
every minute of it.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.375
There's always other nights!

43:06.458 --> 43:08.252
Enjoy this one.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.513
Dr. Buss?

43:19.596 --> 43:21.098
We need to beat the rush
down to the stage.

43:21.181 --> 43:23.600
Come on. It's time for
your moment in the sun.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.439
One second, Dave.

43:31.066 --> 43:33.527
Jessie
Don't be a sore winner,
Gerald.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.448
You promised me a smile.

43:39.074 --> 43:40.659
It's not fair.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.330
You're talking to yourself,
Gerald.

43:59.219 --> 44:01.013
Man
Alright, if you can get
Kareem all set,

44:01.096 --> 44:03.640
-we'll be calling you
back in a minute.
-Yes. He will be ready.

44:03.724 --> 44:07.311
-Baby, they're gonna
call you in a minute

44:07.394 --> 44:11.357
for the broadcast because
you just won the MVP Award.

44:13.359 --> 44:16.028
I'm so proud of you.

44:16.111 --> 44:17.988
Just a magical,
magical night,

44:18.072 --> 44:19.698
led by a 20-year-old rookie

44:19.782 --> 44:21.992
who was playing basketball
in high school

44:22.076 --> 44:24.370
-just two short years ago.
-I can't believe it.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.789
Without question now,
without any question at all,

44:26.872 --> 44:29.541
the greatest game
ever played in the NBA.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.835
Winning a world championship,
on the road,

44:31.919 --> 44:35.089
in one of the most hostile
arenas in all of sports.

44:35.172 --> 44:36.924
-Yeah!
-Fuck, yeah!

44:49.019 --> 44:51.146
Congratulations, Norm.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.482
-Thank you!
-Congratulations.

44:53.565 --> 44:55.025
Earvin! Got a minute?

44:55.109 --> 44:56.985
Congratulations, Earvin.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.487
-Mr. Stern!
-Listen, uh,

44:58.570 --> 44:59.696
we have a little problem.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.073
What, you gonna take it back?

45:01.156 --> 45:02.741
Not that. I promise.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.993
"SPORT Magazine,"
you know the publication.

45:05.077 --> 45:07.830
They sponsor our series MVP.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.790
And see, the writers voted

45:09.873 --> 45:12.251
to award it to Kareem.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.128
That's great! He deserve it!

45:14.211 --> 45:16.422
-We ain't here weren't for him.
-Of course.

45:16.505 --> 45:18.257
Except he isn't here.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.467
Wait, they can't get
him on the phone?

45:20.551 --> 45:22.219
Well, we could,

45:22.302 --> 45:24.805
but remember what we
talked about at dinner?

45:26.557 --> 45:28.976
I think you proved it
to the world tonight.

45:29.059 --> 45:31.645
The man of the moment is you.

45:31.728 --> 45:35.274
So, you want me to
accept it for Kareem?

45:35.357 --> 45:37.776
I want you to accept it.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.611
Darth Vader wins
Rookie of the Year,

45:39.695 --> 45:41.947
but you're the last
man standing.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.783
With a trophy of his own.
In every living room.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.368
Hell of a story,
don't you think?

45:48.203 --> 45:51.248
-Maybe next year,
he strikes back.

45:51.331 --> 45:52.750
Maybe you defend the title.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.085
Tune in and find out.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.173
But I'm gonna need an answer.

46:08.223 --> 46:09.600
That whole combination going

46:09.683 --> 46:11.727
with you and Magic.
It's fantastic.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.228
-Thank you, Mr. Sharman.
-Okay, Coop.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.354
Really proud of you guys.

46:14.438 --> 46:15.772
Alright? Do it again next year.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.858
-Of course. Of course.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.402
Excuse me a minute.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.570
Psst.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.659
Get your ass in there.

46:27.743 --> 46:30.829
No, this one ain't mine, Bill.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.665
It would have been if we lost,
though, wouldn't it?

46:36.335 --> 46:38.754
-What about the next one?
-Huh?

46:38.837 --> 46:41.048
What about the next one?

46:41.131 --> 46:43.842
Oh... What about it?

46:43.926 --> 46:45.344
Fellow knows me pretty well

46:45.427 --> 46:47.095
thinks that the front office

46:47.179 --> 46:49.723
might be my sweet spot.

46:52.851 --> 46:54.228
What?

46:56.688 --> 46:58.273
Monday.

46:58.357 --> 47:00.692
Bright and early
after the parade.

47:01.818 --> 47:03.612
We start next season.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.375
Larry O'
Well done, gentlemen! Jerry--

47:16.458 --> 47:18.544
-There he is!

47:34.935 --> 47:36.395
Hey!

47:36.478 --> 47:38.397
-Fucking helicopter,
it's a death trap.
-I know! I know!

47:38.480 --> 47:41.024
-What are you gonna do?
-Alright, Hot Rod.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.317
Thank you very much.

47:42.401 --> 47:44.486
I'm here with
the commissioner of the NBA,

47:44.570 --> 47:47.656
Larry O'Brien.
Very happy owner of the Lakers,

47:47.739 --> 47:49.241
a couple of players. Larry,

47:49.324 --> 47:51.868
why don't you present
the trophy to Jerry Buss?

47:51.952 --> 47:53.161
Well, I'm happy to do it.

47:53.245 --> 47:56.540
We just finished the greatest
season in NBA history,

47:56.623 --> 47:59.459
and I think the greatest
series in NBA history.

47:59.543 --> 48:02.796
It is my great honor to
present this world trophy

48:02.879 --> 48:05.841
to the owner of
the new world champion

48:05.924 --> 48:07.801
Los Angeles Lakers.

48:07.884 --> 48:10.637
He's a rookie himself,

48:10.721 --> 48:12.806
Dr. Jerry Buss!

48:14.057 --> 48:15.309
There you go. That's yours!

48:15.392 --> 48:17.060
That's permanent! You keep that!

48:18.395 --> 48:20.814
Well, you've been
an NBA owner all of one year,

48:20.897 --> 48:24.192
already you're a champion,
must be on top of the world.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.657
-Hoo! Yeah. Uh...

48:30.741 --> 48:33.535
I tell you, I have never
had a group of men

48:33.619 --> 48:35.621
like this team do so much...

48:36.121 --> 48:37.623
uh...

48:37.706 --> 48:40.083
minute by minute, week by week,

48:40.167 --> 48:41.877
month by month. Uh...

48:41.960 --> 48:44.254
-We played, what, 108 games?

48:45.422 --> 48:48.967
And these guys gave
everything they had.

48:49.051 --> 48:51.345
Well, this is the end result,

48:51.428 --> 48:53.805
so thank you, guys!
Thank you!

48:57.809 --> 49:00.520
Well, where do
you go from here?

49:04.733 --> 49:07.110
Now, I guess we do it
all over again!

49:07.194 --> 49:10.489
O'
Hey! That's what
I'm talking about!

49:11.990 --> 49:14.242
Go ahead!
Everyone who said
we couldn't do it,

49:14.326 --> 49:17.579
you can go ...

49:17.663 --> 49:18.997
And there you have it.

49:19.081 --> 49:21.541
Colorful owner Jerry Buss
and his champion Lakers...

49:21.625 --> 49:23.585
Baby, they're gonna call soon.
Okay? Don't worry.

49:23.669 --> 49:25.796
Moments from now,
we will be bringing to you

49:25.879 --> 49:28.799
the presentation of this
year's "SPORT Magazine"
Finals MVP.

49:28.882 --> 49:30.967
And, of course,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

49:31.051 --> 49:33.762
was this year's scoring leader.
But, tonight,

49:33.845 --> 49:36.723
tonight was all about
the rookie sensation.

49:36.807 --> 49:38.725
And so, we take you
to our own Bill Russell

49:38.809 --> 49:42.562
to present the award to
Earvin "Magic" Johnson.

49:42.646 --> 49:46.233
-Congratulations, Earvin.
-Thanks, Mr. Stern.

49:46.316 --> 49:48.443
Thanks, Bill.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.529
And, you know...

49:50.612 --> 49:53.031
we couldn't have done none
of this without Kareem.

49:53.115 --> 49:56.159
-He the man on his team.
-I'm sure he's watching.

49:57.619 --> 49:59.413
Well, he couldn't be here,

49:59.496 --> 50:01.665
so I knew I had to take over,

50:01.748 --> 50:04.000
get the job done.

50:05.585 --> 50:07.129
But,

50:08.171 --> 50:10.340
you know, I'm glad of that.

50:11.591 --> 50:13.885
'Cause I love to win.

50:13.969 --> 50:17.055
And I guess I proved
a few things to them doubters.

50:17.139 --> 50:19.599
-Magic is a winner.
-There's some

50:19.683 --> 50:22.853
great players who have
never won a championship.

50:22.936 --> 50:24.604
How many more do you want?

50:24.688 --> 50:28.066
Oh, about 20.

50:28.150 --> 50:31.069
-You okay?

50:36.658 --> 50:39.453
Well, I'll tell you what.
It beats the booby prize.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.246
At least you made the cut.

50:41.329 --> 50:44.666
-Those fucking jokers
forgot my name.
-Next year.

50:45.542 --> 50:46.960
We make this our own.

50:48.044 --> 50:50.839
Next year.

50:51.548 --> 50:53.341
Quiet in here.

50:53.425 --> 50:55.427
'Cause it's unbelievable.

50:57.095 --> 50:59.681
Well, you must be
used to it by now.

50:59.765 --> 51:03.268
-All this winning.
-Yeah.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.982
I just don't want it to end.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.944
Me neither.

51:17.199 --> 51:18.366
Hm.

51:30.879 --> 51:33.548
Abdul-
Spence! You here?

51:36.635 --> 51:38.011
-Spence!

51:39.846 --> 51:42.098
-Haywood -
Don't move, motherfucker.
-Abdul-- Jesus...

51:42.182 --> 51:44.518
It's just me, Spence.

51:44.601 --> 51:46.436
I've been calling.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.522
I came to say congratulations.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.441
-We won.
-Fuck you.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.318
I ain't win shit. You won.

51:53.401 --> 51:55.237
You motherfuckers
kicked me to the curb,

51:55.320 --> 51:56.780
and you got the nerve
to come in here,

51:56.863 --> 51:58.824
talking about congratulations?

51:58.907 --> 52:01.034
-I'm here now.
-Why?

52:01.117 --> 52:04.412
Because I don't wanna read
about it in a newspaper that

52:04.496 --> 52:07.165
-they found you in an alley.
-It ain't gonna be in no alley,

52:07.249 --> 52:09.709
But it is gonna be by my terms.

52:09.793 --> 52:13.380
-You'd be killing
the wrong man, Spence.
-Nigga, you don't know me.

52:13.463 --> 52:16.466
I know Spencer Haywood.

52:16.550 --> 52:19.010
Yeah? Spencer Haywood
ain't shit!

52:19.094 --> 52:22.055
-I don't believe that.
-Like hell, nigga.

52:22.138 --> 52:23.723
You know exactly what I am.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.350
You figured out my trick!

52:25.433 --> 52:28.520
That's why my Black ass ain't
drinking bubbly right now

52:28.603 --> 52:30.021
with the rest of the team.

52:30.105 --> 52:32.315
'Cause you know I ain't shit.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.025
Nigga, you know I ain't shit,

52:34.109 --> 52:36.236
and I ain't gonna never be shit!

52:36.319 --> 52:37.571
Just the same!

52:37.654 --> 52:39.447
Just like I always been!

52:39.531 --> 52:42.158
-Always!
-I know someone told you that.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.743
That's what I am.

52:47.038 --> 52:48.748
-No.
-Look at me.

52:53.628 --> 52:54.921
Look at her.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.464
Is your daughter beautiful?

52:56.548 --> 52:58.174
Look at your daughter.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.930
-Is she beautiful?
Is your daughter beautiful?
-I can't.

53:04.014 --> 53:06.057
-That ain't me.
-It is.

53:06.141 --> 53:08.935
Half of that beauty
comes from you.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.145
It's yours.

53:10.228 --> 53:13.315
A beautiful Black man.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.025
My beautiful brother.

53:15.817 --> 53:18.445
It's too late.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.906
-It's not.
-I can't.

53:20.989 --> 53:24.075
I can't. I can't. I can't
live like this anymore.

53:24.159 --> 53:26.661
I fucked up.

53:29.706 --> 53:33.001
-You're a champion.

53:41.009 --> 53:43.136
Norman
Whoo, cowboy Cap!

53:43.219 --> 53:45.347
-Hey, Cap.
-We're good.

53:46.806 --> 53:48.433
Congratulations.

54:11.623 --> 54:14.209
City's out there
throwing you a party.

54:14.292 --> 54:15.919
Oh, that's their party.

54:16.002 --> 54:18.213
Is this the paperwork?

54:18.296 --> 54:20.382
This is the old paperwork,

54:20.465 --> 54:22.300
and this is the new.

54:23.134 --> 54:25.720
Just needs a signature.

54:31.434 --> 54:33.186
How's that look to you?

54:35.689 --> 54:37.857
Like we need to talk
about a raise.

54:39.192 --> 54:40.819
Looking forward to it, Claire.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.155
Me, too.

55:00.630 --> 55:03.174
You remember what I was
saying about swan songs?

55:04.092 --> 55:06.302
Well...

55:06.386 --> 55:09.180
I went through about
80 million bucks this season.

55:11.599 --> 55:14.352
But I got a few grand
left in the bank...

55:15.353 --> 55:16.980
fresh line of credit...

55:17.939 --> 55:20.442
and the best team in basketball.

55:20.525 --> 55:23.653
So, swan songs?

55:24.946 --> 55:26.740
This ain't mine.

55:28.783 --> 55:31.661
Watch me paddle, motherfuckers.

55:31.745 --> 55:33.913
Got something for ya!

55:35.290 --> 55:36.958
Whoo!

55:38.460 --> 55:39.836
Yeah!
