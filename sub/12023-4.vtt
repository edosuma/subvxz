Male narrator: Tonight
on Ice Road Truckers...

00:04.724 --> 00:06.358
She's cracking up big
time under me here.

00:06.360 --> 00:09.227
Narrator: The Canadians
battle thin ice.

00:09.229 --> 00:11.730
We're right in her now.

00:11.732 --> 00:14.867
Narrator: And in Alaska,
rookies run wild.

00:14.869 --> 00:16.903
I'm gonna take out the top dogs.

00:16.905 --> 00:19.806
Narrator: As everyone
guns for the top spot.

00:19.808 --> 00:22.610
It's gonna be like a
rocket ship to Prudhoe.

00:22.612 --> 00:25.713
As far as I'm concerned, you're
not qualified to be here.

00:25.715 --> 00:27.816
Narrator: But when mother
nature strikes...

00:27.818 --> 00:31.688
We're going to get into a blow, then
there's going to be zero visibility.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.790
Narrator: Nobody's
making it home.

00:34.792 --> 00:37.559
We're not going to
get through this.

00:39.697 --> 00:42.365
I'm stuck here.

Narrator: In Fairbanks...

01:21.444 --> 01:22.911
Going into dispatch.

01:22.913 --> 01:24.979
It's about 5:30 in the morning.

01:24.981 --> 01:27.615
Go see what they got for me
to bring to Prudhoe today.

01:27.617 --> 01:30.318
Narrator: Eager rookie, Austin
Wheeler is first through

01:30.320 --> 01:31.920
the door at dispatch.

01:31.922 --> 01:33.354
You got me some paperwork?

01:33.356 --> 01:33.388
You got me some paperwork?

01:33.422 --> 01:35.990
Hey, it's too early in the morning
for this shit, Austin.

01:35.992 --> 01:38.359
I'm ready to go, man.

01:38.361 --> 01:41.396
Little mini-excavator for
our mini-heavy-hauler.

01:41.398 --> 01:43.131
Yes.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.567
Hell yeah, it's
only 18,000 pounds.

01:45.569 --> 01:47.769
It's going to be like a
rocket ship to Prudhoe.

01:47.771 --> 01:48.437
All right.

01:48.439 --> 01:49.104
Stay out of trouble.

01:49.106 --> 01:51.173
All right, see ya.

01:51.175 --> 01:54.944
Narrator: Since the season
began, Austin's been enrolled

01:54.946 --> 01:56.847
in the school of Jack Jessee.

01:56.849 --> 01:57.648
You're Austin?

01:57.650 --> 01:58.315
Yes, sir.

01:58.317 --> 02:01.719
[Laughs]

02:01.721 --> 02:05.857
Narrator: But the 23-year-old
hasn't been impressed with the ace.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.493
Well, he's a douche bag for
sitting in Coldfoot while I

02:08.495 --> 02:10.228
loaded up the truck by myself.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.063
[Honking]

02:12.065 --> 02:15.968
Narrator: Today, Austin's running
solo, getting his first

02:15.970 --> 02:20.005
taste of freedom and a
chance to set his own pace.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.073
I'm gonna shoot up to
Prudhoe one day, spend the

02:22.075 --> 02:25.911
night, jet back the next day,
and go straight back up.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.114
Just keep hammering them out.

02:28.116 --> 02:31.183
There are some more experienced
people in my way of being the

02:31.185 --> 02:34.554
load count champ, but that's not
gonna stop me because I know

02:34.556 --> 02:37.590
that, you know, in
here I can do it.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.926
Well, everything
checks out good.

02:39.928 --> 02:42.729
Let's, uh, let's
get out of here.

02:42.731 --> 02:46.767
My goal is to be jacking
the load count.

02:46.769 --> 02:49.736
Narrator: Hauling an
18,000-pound load of excavation

02:49.738 --> 02:55.076
equipment, Austin's
first out of the yard.

02:55.078 --> 02:58.246
Who decides to show up for work?

02:58.248 --> 03:00.081
Jack Jessee.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.082
We'll give him a honk.

03:01.084 --> 03:03.718
[Honking]

03:03.720 --> 03:10.092
Just showing up to work an hour after
I do, that's the way I like it.

03:10.094 --> 03:15.397
Narrator: But this morning, Jack's got
more on his mind than getting a load.

03:15.399 --> 03:17.700
I think Austin came in
a little too strong.

03:17.702 --> 03:21.003
If he thinks he can handle this
without any instructions, I

03:21.005 --> 03:25.241
mean, he should probably turn around
and go back to wherever he came from.

03:26.710 --> 03:32.515
Narrator: - After struggling to rein
in the rookie... - Man, Austin?

03:32.517 --> 03:34.751
Hammer down, boys.

03:34.753 --> 03:38.322
[Honking]

03:38.324 --> 03:42.059
Narrator: Jack's taking
his concerns to the boss.

03:42.061 --> 03:46.730
So, Austin, I think we need to
talk about him a little bit.

03:46.732 --> 03:49.533
Really?

03:49.535 --> 03:52.035
I think he's trying to
do too much too fast.

03:52.037 --> 03:53.503
He's getting in too
big of a hurry.

03:53.505 --> 03:57.507
Separated the convoy by 30
miles at one point, and he

03:57.509 --> 03:58.775
just-- He ran off and left me.

03:58.777 --> 04:00.577
Like, it's not sinking in.

04:00.579 --> 04:01.978
He's just getting
ahead of himself.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.713
I don't want him to
learn bad habits.

04:03.715 --> 04:06.116
I appreciate your opinion.

04:06.118 --> 04:07.951
If I think the guy is a problem
on the road, I don't have any

04:07.953 --> 04:10.754
problem pulling him off there,
but I just don't believe that's

04:10.756 --> 04:12.289
the case with Austin right now.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.090
I think he's got what it takes.

04:14.092 --> 04:16.826
Maybe you better go out and get
in your truck and take your

04:16.827 --> 04:21.231
load, and I'll worry about
getting Austin up the road.

04:23.267 --> 04:26.069
All right.

04:26.071 --> 04:28.071
Jack and Austin didn't get along
real well, didn't hit it

04:28.073 --> 04:29.605
off right away.

04:29.607 --> 04:33.310
Not that I disagreed with Jack,
but the bottom line is, Austin's

04:33.312 --> 04:35.045
got the skill to
handle the big stuff.

04:35.047 --> 04:35.712
He's proved that.

04:35.714 --> 04:39.550
Um, maybe Jack's threatened by
that, I don't know, but I have

04:39.552 --> 04:42.753
to be fair to all my drivers,
give 'em all a fair shot.

04:44.188 --> 04:47.824
Narrator: With the veteran's
doubts falling on deaf ears,

04:47.826 --> 04:51.862
Jack hooks up to his load of
lumber and a pick-up truck.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.634
I went in there and
said my piece.

04:56.636 --> 04:59.136
I don't know if he was listening
that well or not, but Austin

04:59.138 --> 05:01.605
doesn't have near the miles that
I do, and I know Lane ain't got

05:01.607 --> 05:04.909
near the miles
that I do, if any.

05:04.911 --> 05:07.478
Lane wants me to step up and
lead the pack this year, but if

05:07.480 --> 05:11.316
nobody's going to listen
to me, why bother?

05:15.187 --> 05:21.960
Narrator: 250 miles up the road...
after spending the night in

05:21.962 --> 05:25.930
Coldfoot, Darrell Ward is
already halfway to Prudhoe Bay

05:25.932 --> 05:30.101
with a 28,000-pound load
of portable heaters.

05:30.103 --> 05:32.237
I'm headed north.

05:32.239 --> 05:35.173
It started snowing, and, you
know, what I got to watch for

05:35.175 --> 05:38.076
is somebody else getting
crossways in the road and me

05:38.078 --> 05:41.447
coming up on 'em and not seeing
'em, you know, or they could be

05:41.449 --> 05:48.119
on my side of the road because they're
not as capable of doing this as I am.

05:48.121 --> 05:50.855
Narrator: Just two weeks into
the season, Darrell's tied

05:50.857 --> 05:52.823
for the lead in the load count.

05:52.825 --> 05:55.025
Farther north I go,
the worse she gets.

05:55.027 --> 05:57.760
Narrator: And the Montana
legend isn't about to let a

05:57.762 --> 06:02.398
mistake knock him
from the top spot.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.201
You know, this road could be
a little slick today, uh, I

06:05.203 --> 06:08.771
just, uh-- and I got this load
that I'm afraid is going to move

06:08.773 --> 06:12.942
around on me, so I
will take it easy.

06:21.252 --> 06:26.789
I just keep an eye on everything
and make sure it's good.

06:29.059 --> 06:30.493
Whoo-hoo, whoop-tada!

06:30.495 --> 06:32.095
I'm ready to roll.

06:32.097 --> 06:35.165
Rock and roll.

06:35.167 --> 06:40.270
It's a good feeling when
they realize what I can do.

06:40.272 --> 06:42.972
You know, I'm doing my job.

06:42.974 --> 06:44.675
They're happy with it.

06:44.677 --> 06:45.709
Awesome.

06:45.711 --> 06:47.377
Make me feel good.

06:47.379 --> 06:49.813
Narrator: Holding a half day's
lead on the rest of the

06:49.815 --> 06:53.517
pack, Darrell's
approach is paying off.

06:53.519 --> 06:54.384
I'm killing it.

06:54.386 --> 06:56.353
I'm gonna to take
out the top dog.

06:56.355 --> 06:59.889
I'm going to be
the new top dog.

07:03.427 --> 07:08.564
Narrator: 2,400 miles to the
southeast in Manitoba, Canada...

07:10.500 --> 07:13.736
We got 16 fresh water tanks
going to St. Theresa Island.

07:13.738 --> 07:15.304
What if I poop in one?

07:15.306 --> 07:19.042
Then we have 15 fresh water
tanks and one sewage tank.

07:19.044 --> 07:21.411
[Both laughing]

07:21.413 --> 07:23.746
Narrator: Back from their first
trip and anxious to get

07:23.748 --> 07:29.185
in another run, Hugh and Rick
are turning and burning.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.720
Sir, you may want to
Polar Bearize those.

07:31.722 --> 07:32.921
Yeah?

07:32.923 --> 07:36.158
Today, they're heading 300
miles north, hauling

07:36.160 --> 07:39.994
freshwater tanks to the
village of St. Theresa.

07:39.996 --> 07:44.065
I do 'em tight, he does
'em Polar Bear tight.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.000
Let's roll.

07:50.573 --> 07:52.841
Yeah, apparently they got more
loads going up this year

07:52.843 --> 07:56.379
than any other year so far
that need to get up the roads.

07:56.381 --> 07:58.915
Narrator: But with warm weather
wreaking havoc on the

07:58.917 --> 08:04.621
winter roads, melting sections
could shut down without warning.

08:04.623 --> 08:08.458
I guess we're kind of taking a gamble,
but it's just the way this game goes.

08:08.460 --> 08:15.399
It's the risk or the gamble I took when
I turned the key and headed out here.

08:15.401 --> 08:18.636
Narrator: 50 miles north of
town, Hugh and Rick reach the

08:18.638 --> 08:23.107
entrance to the
St. Theresa winter road...

08:23.109 --> 08:27.311
And so far, luck
is on their side.

08:27.313 --> 08:30.415
[Honking]

08:30.417 --> 08:32.683
Oh, they had a big snow bank
across the front of the road

08:32.686 --> 08:36.354
here and, uh, they just opened
it up, and I think we're the

08:36.356 --> 08:38.856
first two trucks on it.

08:38.857 --> 08:40.791
It's gonna be rough in here.

08:40.793 --> 08:45.596
Narrator: But first on the road
also means first on the ice.

08:45.598 --> 08:46.363
We'll see what we hit.

08:46.365 --> 08:49.700
This is supposed to be the roughest
son of a bitch they got out here.

08:49.702 --> 08:53.403
Narrator: If they can
get there in one piece.

08:59.243 --> 09:03.213
It's pretty fucking rough.

09:03.215 --> 09:04.481
We're down to about fucking

09:04.483 --> 09:09.586
20 kilometers an hour here,
'cause it's that rough.

09:09.588 --> 09:11.421
The winter road's just
like the autobahn.

09:11.423 --> 09:13.357
You can go as fast as you want
if you can hang on to the

09:13.359 --> 09:16.560
fucking steering wheel.

09:25.737 --> 09:30.407
Narrator: As they clear
the next rise...

09:30.409 --> 09:37.581
A two-mile stretch of virgin
ice appears up ahead.

09:37.583 --> 09:41.018
Okay, we are just edging
onto the lake right now.

09:49.527 --> 09:55.499
There's a good reminder that this is
a fucking dangerous, dangerous job.

09:55.501 --> 09:59.637
There's a big excavator
in the water.

09:59.639 --> 10:02.706
Don't fuck around,
respect shit.

10:09.614 --> 10:12.916
She's a-crackin'.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.622
Narrator: In the unseasonably
warm weather, ice

10:18.624 --> 10:21.458
is fragile and quick to crack.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.761
Let me know when
I'm good to come.

10:23.763 --> 10:25.896
Got it, 10-4.

10:25.898 --> 10:29.099
Narrator: The plan is to cross
one at a time to increase

10:29.101 --> 10:32.503
their chances of staying dry.

10:32.505 --> 10:34.638
[Over CB] How does it look
up there, Polar Bear?

10:34.640 --> 10:35.406
Very thin.

10:35.408 --> 10:38.909
Very thin.

10:38.911 --> 10:42.012
With me just crawling across
here like this, the cracks

10:42.014 --> 10:44.981
right beside my window here are
opening up at least an inch,

10:44.983 --> 10:46.883
two inches right there.

10:46.885 --> 10:49.186
Oh, so she's thin?

10:49.188 --> 10:51.589
Yeah, 10-4.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.103
You just watch these
cracks shoot across.

11:06.105 --> 11:08.439
There's no cracks, and then all
of a sudden there's cracks.

11:08.441 --> 11:10.808
And look at that, cracks.

11:13.812 --> 11:15.780
[Laughing] Oh, fuck.

11:19.518 --> 11:22.120
Okay, you can probably
come on if you want.

11:22.122 --> 11:24.355
10-4-ski.

11:24.357 --> 11:26.657
Yeah, she's cracking up big
time under me here, like,

11:26.659 --> 11:29.894
there's cracks shooting all
over the place and they are up

11:29.896 --> 11:33.764
to about an inch wide when I'm
doing it, so just go slow.

11:33.766 --> 11:34.699
10-4.

11:34.701 --> 11:37.668
This is ice road trucking now.

11:52.784 --> 11:53.951
It's what we do.

11:53.953 --> 11:57.989
We're jumping into a bunch
of shit this time around.

11:57.991 --> 12:00.559
You could never stop
with a load on this.

12:00.561 --> 12:02.794
You'd go down.

12:02.796 --> 12:07.132
Narrator: Halfway across and
100 feet from the bottom, the

12:07.134 --> 12:11.970
ice under Hugh's rig is
starting to fracture.

12:11.972 --> 12:14.305
See we're just cracking
the fuck out of this.

12:14.307 --> 12:16.307
Holy fuck.

12:18.943 --> 12:21.311
Big time, big time.

12:23.747 --> 12:29.619
[Ice cracking]

12:30.554 --> 12:31.988
Oh, fuck, yeah.

12:31.990 --> 12:33.690
We're right in her now.

12:33.692 --> 12:34.924
We're sinking.

12:34.926 --> 12:36.259
Hold on!

12:40.694 --> 12:44.697
[Ice cracking]

12:44.699 --> 12:47.801
Narrator: In Manitoba, Canada...

12:49.436 --> 12:51.671
See, we're just cracking
the fuck out of this.

12:51.673 --> 12:53.472
Holy fuck.

12:53.474 --> 12:55.374
Narrator: Hugh and Rick are
headed to the village of

12:55.376 --> 13:02.315
St. Theresa, hauling a load of water
tanks over 100 feet of water.

13:02.317 --> 13:06.586
Oh, fuck, yeah, we're
right in her now.

13:06.588 --> 13:07.787
Sinking.

13:07.789 --> 13:09.688
Hold on!

13:16.262 --> 13:17.962
Holy fuck!

13:23.101 --> 13:25.937
Fell through back
there a little bit.

13:28.908 --> 13:33.344
You just respect the ice, and
you'll make it through there.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.114
Yee haw!

13:36.116 --> 13:37.782
Whoo!

13:37.784 --> 13:42.454
[Laughs]

13:42.456 --> 13:45.490
Well, that was kind of bad
coming through there.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.961
Well, we made it off another one
there, buddy, and we're-- we're

13:48.963 --> 13:50.829
still here, sink or swim.

13:50.831 --> 13:50.862
Still here, sink or swim.

13:50.897 --> 13:54.433
I don't know, I'm
still not there yet.

13:54.435 --> 13:56.135
You've got it.

13:56.137 --> 13:57.503
Stay to the right.

13:57.505 --> 13:59.638
You see that hole that's
sittin' down there.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.074
Yeah, that's a big 10-4.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.852
This separates the
men from the boys.

14:33.738 --> 14:36.340
I'm clear, buddy.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.576
That's pretty fucking trippy,
watching them cracks open up, eh?

14:39.578 --> 14:42.979
Yeah, you know you're, uh,
you're pretty fucking green ice

14:42.981 --> 14:45.715
when you're out
there doing that.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.691
Narrator: 2,400 miles to the
northwest in Fairbanks...

14:53.725 --> 14:56.727
I hate to say it, but my life's
in another man's hands right now.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.831
Narrator: South Carolina native,
Ronald "Porkchop" Mangum

14:59.833 --> 15:05.404
is on his way to answer for what
could be a career-ending mistake.

15:05.406 --> 15:09.474
Last trip, porkchop failed to
properly hook up his trailer...

15:09.476 --> 15:11.643
[Metal scraping]

15:11.645 --> 15:13.178
Son of a bitch!

15:13.180 --> 15:18.616
Putting Carlile's 3-1/2 million
pound oil rig move in jeopardy.

15:18.618 --> 15:22.954
Trailer jaws weren't locked in place all
the way and she fell to the ground.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.390
I screwed up and I screwed up big
time as far as dropping that trailer.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.925
I hope everything works
out pretty good.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.527
We'll just have
to wait and see.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.161
I don't want to go
home a failure.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.331
I miss my wife and kids, but
I don't want to go home yet.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.467
Narrator: With his dream of
making big money in Alaska on

15:37.469 --> 15:41.571
the line, Porkchop reports
to the boss's office.

15:41.573 --> 15:42.371
How you doing?

15:42.373 --> 15:43.739
Mind if come in and talk to you?

15:43.741 --> 15:44.406
Have a seat.

15:44.408 --> 15:45.073
Yes, sir.

15:45.075 --> 15:45.107
Yes, sir.

15:45.141 --> 15:48.043
Why don't you close
that door too?

15:52.782 --> 15:55.084
The other night in Prudhoe when
you were getting ready to go

15:55.086 --> 15:58.655
out on the ice, it sounds like
you didn't do a complete check

15:58.657 --> 16:01.791
on your fifth wheel and ended
up dropping the trailer out

16:01.793 --> 16:03.026
there in the yard, huh?

16:03.028 --> 16:07.063
Yes, sir, I'm completely
guilty as charged.

16:07.065 --> 16:09.065
I can't be there
to do it for you.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.835
I can't expect your driver/trainer
to be there and do it for you.

16:11.837 --> 16:14.971
He shouldn't have to tell you to do the
basic steps of being a truck driver.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.907
You've got to start the truck,
you know, you've got get it

16:16.909 --> 16:18.742
hooked up to the trailer, you've
got to make sure you're hooked

16:18.744 --> 16:21.478
up, and then you got to make sure
your load is tied down, right?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.314
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
you don't do any one

16:24.316 --> 16:28.050
of those steps, then-- then
you're not qualified to be here.

16:28.052 --> 16:31.220
In 15 years, I've never had it happen,
and I'm embarrassed about it.

16:31.222 --> 16:34.691
Okay, well that doesn't
fix the problem.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.960
I guess I'm to the point where
we need to take a little break

16:36.962 --> 16:42.166
here and, uh, get back together in a
couple days and we'll revisit it, okay?

16:44.669 --> 16:47.204
I just got out of a meeting
with Lane, got my ass-chewing

16:47.206 --> 16:48.973
like I figured I
was going to get.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.509
He probably wanted to jump
across the desk and rip my head

16:51.511 --> 16:59.117
off and stomp on me, but for the most
part I think he was very reserved.

16:59.119 --> 17:04.390
Yeah, I just got done talking to Porkchop,
had him back in the office again.

17:04.392 --> 17:07.693
Pretty much a common
thing these days.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.161
I'm going to do a
little thinking.

17:09.163 --> 17:11.763
He's going to do a
little thinking.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.336
You know, I'm not sure he's got a
future at Carlile, because I'm

17:16.338 --> 17:19.306
not sure it's gonna work.

17:22.877 --> 17:26.780
Narrator: 100 miles north...

17:26.814 --> 17:27.981
We're hauling ass!

17:27.983 --> 17:30.083
[Honking]

17:30.085 --> 17:34.520
23-year-old Dalton newcomer,
Austin Wheeler, is making good

17:34.522 --> 17:37.790
time on his first solo trip.

17:37.792 --> 17:43.229
We got a full tank of gas, a four-pack
of Red Bull, and a pound of beef jerky.

17:43.231 --> 17:47.299
We're going as fast
as the law allows.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.338
Narrator: Determined to stay
ahead of former mentor, Jack

17:53.340 --> 17:57.476
Jessee, Austin is setting
an aggressive pace.

17:57.478 --> 17:59.478
We're gonna pass.

18:04.651 --> 18:08.121
[Honking]

18:08.123 --> 18:10.223
It's so nice to be
by myself finally.

18:10.225 --> 18:13.794
I feel like I won't get slowed
down at all today and nothing's

18:13.796 --> 18:17.865
out there to stop me.

18:19.534 --> 18:22.870
Narrator: - But as he speeds north...
- Hey, you know, it's pretty

18:22.872 --> 18:27.107
bad; I'm dying up here
with 105,000 pounds.

18:27.109 --> 18:31.112
Narrator: The radio comes to
life with a call for help.

18:31.114 --> 18:32.580
Where's Austin at?

18:32.582 --> 18:34.449
I could use a little push here.

18:34.451 --> 18:38.821
Don't you worry, I'll be
there before you know it.

18:38.823 --> 18:41.524
Well, there's another Carlile
driver up ahead of us here

18:41.526 --> 18:46.830
that-- He's kind of heavy, and, uh,
he's slowing way down on the hills.

18:46.832 --> 18:50.400
Asked if I can give him a little
push up to Gobbler's Knob.

18:50.402 --> 18:54.537
I don't mind helping
another driver out.

18:54.539 --> 18:57.974
Narrator: When push-trucking,
the front truck does the

18:57.976 --> 19:02.345
steering while the back truck
provides the extra power, but

19:02.347 --> 19:08.918
if either driver loses control,
they'll both end up in the ditch.

19:11.421 --> 19:13.989
There's definitely a lot of
things that can go wrong when

19:13.991 --> 19:15.291
you're push-trucking.

19:15.293 --> 19:16.925
You don't know what's
in front of you.

19:16.927 --> 19:21.963
You're trusting the driver in front
of you to steer you on the road.

19:25.968 --> 19:28.971
All right, I got you, I'll
start speeding up here.

19:31.775 --> 19:33.008
You don't want to hit him hard.

19:33.010 --> 19:38.482
It ruins front ends on trucks
and bumpers on trailers.

19:38.484 --> 19:41.017
Hang on.

19:51.327 --> 19:56.364
Narrator: 150 miles north
of Fairbanks... [Honking]

19:56.366 --> 20:00.035
Haul road rookie Austin Wheeler
is about to rear-end another

20:00.037 --> 20:02.971
big rig... on purpose.

20:02.973 --> 20:04.406
You don't want to hit him hard.

20:04.408 --> 20:09.345
It ruins front ends of trucks
and bumpers on trailers.

20:09.347 --> 20:11.914
Hang on.

20:22.927 --> 20:28.031
The reason why you're pushing is to
help get that weight up the hill.

20:34.104 --> 20:37.306
Narrator: With the two trucks
locked in, Austin's at the mercy

20:37.308 --> 20:41.677
of the 50-ton rig
riding his bumper.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.918
When you're push-trucking,
you don't steer.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.422
The front truck steers for you,
you just keep your foot in it.

20:57.192 --> 21:01.496
You want to try to be a little faster
than the driver that you're pushing.

21:01.498 --> 21:06.166
There's an art to push-trucking,
they just don't let anybody do it.

21:06.168 --> 21:08.636
All right, I'm backing off you.

21:08.638 --> 21:10.304
[On CB] 10-4.

21:18.846 --> 21:21.415
I just sat back and
enjoyed the ride, man.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.516
I sure appreciate it.

21:22.518 --> 21:26.387
I'm going to have to, you know, buy
you a cup of coffee or something now.

21:26.389 --> 21:31.091
Make it a Coke and you got it.

21:31.093 --> 21:34.995
Narrator: While Austin struts
his stuff, 300 miles to the

21:34.997 --> 21:39.534
- north...
- A little chilly.

21:39.536 --> 21:43.204
Narrator: Darrell Ward's
already reached Prudhoe Bay.

21:43.206 --> 21:46.808
After delivering his load of
heaters, he's hoping to score a

21:46.810 --> 21:49.511
backhaul and the extra
pay that comes with it.

21:49.513 --> 21:51.279
What you got for me?

21:51.281 --> 21:53.214
I got a triple stack here.

21:53.216 --> 21:54.048
A triple stack?

21:54.050 --> 21:56.818
Yeah.

21:56.820 --> 21:58.720
How heavy is it?

21:58.722 --> 21:59.988
Heavy enough for a backhaul.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.122
Heavy enough for a backhaul?

22:01.124 --> 22:02.724
It's a paying backhaul.

22:02.726 --> 22:05.060
- All right-- - Be careful there
on Atigun, it's blowing.

22:05.062 --> 22:05.861
Is it blowing?

22:05.863 --> 22:06.528
Yep.

22:06.530 --> 22:07.996
Thanks.

22:11.567 --> 22:15.136
Narrator: Still half a day
ahead of the competition...

22:15.138 --> 22:20.909
All right, get her hooked up, man,
get southbound towards Fairbanks.

22:20.911 --> 22:23.445
Narrator: The Dalton newcomer's
lead has earned him

22:23.447 --> 22:26.348
a coveted bonus on
his return trip.

22:26.350 --> 22:27.950
I got three trailers here.

22:27.952 --> 22:30.386
They're needing them back in
Fairbanks so they can get some

22:30.388 --> 22:32.322
freight moved back
up here, you know?

22:32.324 --> 22:34.724
I was the only that made it here,
so I'm the one that got--

22:34.726 --> 22:36.593
That got trailers to go back.

22:36.595 --> 22:40.497
Right on, we're good
to rock and roll.

22:44.169 --> 22:47.170
You know, I don't think they're ever
going to send me back with nothing.

22:47.172 --> 22:50.373
I think they-- they really
like what I do, you know.

22:50.375 --> 22:54.144
They know that if-- You know,
everything I take is-- It arrives

22:54.146 --> 22:57.314
in the same condition it left in,
you know, and it gets there

22:57.316 --> 23:01.185
on time, so they said, "Give
those flatbeds to Darrell, we

23:01.187 --> 23:02.820
need 'em here and we
need 'em here now.

23:02.822 --> 23:07.024
He's the man that'll
get 'em to us."

23:07.026 --> 23:09.459
When you love to be out here on
the road more than you want to

23:09.461 --> 23:13.496
be at home, I guess maybe I was
meant just to be a single man

23:13.498 --> 23:17.900
and doing what I love
to do, and this is it.

23:21.405 --> 23:25.075
Narrator: 2,400 miles
to the southeast...

23:26.478 --> 23:28.112
Oh, fuck!

23:28.114 --> 23:30.515
Narrator: Hugh and Rick are
battling their way towards

23:30.517 --> 23:36.622
St. Theresa with two loads
of much-needed water tanks.

23:36.624 --> 23:41.493
Fuck!

23:41.495 --> 23:44.162
Narrator: The first drivers
on a newly-opened stretch of

23:44.164 --> 23:49.434
rough road, they are taking their
worst beating of the season.

23:53.673 --> 23:56.609
That's a bit of a rodeo over on
that fucking corner, wasn't there?

23:56.611 --> 23:57.643
That's a 10-4.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.411
It's a little bit of a rodeo
on this whole fucking road.

23:59.413 --> 24:01.647
[Laughs]

24:03.217 --> 24:05.185
[Laughs]

24:06.987 --> 24:10.256
Good thing I wore
my party tie today.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.336
Oh, jeez.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.103
[Laughs]

24:24.105 --> 24:26.606
I knew it was coming.

24:26.608 --> 24:29.142
Once you get her hoppin',
you can't get her stoppin'.

24:29.144 --> 24:31.144
[Chuckles]

24:38.185 --> 24:41.021
Narrator: Despite the rugged
conditions, Hugh and Rick are

24:41.023 --> 24:44.524
finally nearing
their destination.

24:48.296 --> 24:51.498
Okay, hold on.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.368
Narrator: But as they
reach the final turn...

24:54.370 --> 24:56.103
You gotta be joking.

24:56.105 --> 24:59.405
Narrator: The veterans
have run out of road.

24:59.407 --> 25:01.541
Hey, motherfucker, you on here?

25:01.543 --> 25:02.876
Hello, hello, hello.

25:02.878 --> 25:06.646
Hey, we're at-- We're at our
turnoff here for fuck sakes,

25:06.648 --> 25:09.015
and the road's closed.

25:09.017 --> 25:13.887
Narrator: At a standstill, Hugh phones
the buyer to figure out a plan.

25:13.889 --> 25:15.555
Hello, this is, uh, Hugh.

25:15.557 --> 25:20.861
We got a couple loads of water
tanks here, 16 fresh water tanks.

25:20.863 --> 25:27.101
Th-they were supposed to go to
St. Therese, but the road's not open.

25:27.103 --> 25:28.369
Okay.

25:28.371 --> 25:30.939
Okay, thanks, bye.

25:30.941 --> 25:33.574
Narrator: With no word of how
long the melting road will

25:33.576 --> 25:37.011
remain closed, the order is...

25:37.013 --> 25:40.881
Dump the load and
head back to town.

25:43.350 --> 25:44.651
Pretty unique hand bomb.

25:44.653 --> 25:46.786
We always wanted to do it,
and here's our chance.

25:46.788 --> 25:51.492
Wait, wait, wait-- Go.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.795
One more.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.164
There's four.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.565
[Laughs]

25:58.567 --> 25:59.833
That's good.

25:59.835 --> 26:00.500
[Grunts]

26:00.502 --> 26:01.768
[Grunts]

26:03.837 --> 26:05.338
Oh!

26:05.340 --> 26:11.411
[Laughs]

26:11.413 --> 26:16.483
Yeah, baby!

26:16.485 --> 26:17.150
Yeah!

26:17.152 --> 26:19.586
[Laughs]

26:19.588 --> 26:21.588
[Indistinct yelling]

26:35.169 --> 26:37.204
We, uh, had to hand
bomb these tanks off.

26:37.206 --> 26:39.506
Uh, hopefully they're in the
right spot, but, uh, at this

26:39.508 --> 26:41.241
point...[Scoffs]

26:41.243 --> 26:43.677
They're so light, they can
put 'em behind a snowmobile.

26:43.679 --> 26:45.913
Tow 'em in.

26:45.915 --> 26:48.082
Hell of a job,
Mr. Rowland, hell of a job.

26:48.084 --> 26:52.186
I always wanted to do it, now I've done it,
now I hope I never have to do it again.

26:52.188 --> 26:54.889
I agree.

26:54.891 --> 26:57.191
Narrator: With empty trailers,
Hugh and Rick pull

26:57.193 --> 27:01.262
away from only their second
loads of the season.

27:01.264 --> 27:05.266
That's... Not heard of for the
truck driver-- Hey, push your

27:05.268 --> 27:06.601
load off on the
side of the road.

27:06.603 --> 27:08.937
No, that's definitely a first.

27:08.939 --> 27:11.105
[Honking]

27:13.275 --> 27:14.842
Narrator: - Coming up...
- We're going to get into a

27:14.844 --> 27:17.244
blow that is going to
be zero visibility.

27:17.246 --> 27:20.114
Narrator: Winter's wrath
takes hold of the haul road.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.003
We're not going to get through this.

27:25.013 --> 27:29.850
Narrator: 50 miles South
of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska...

27:29.852 --> 27:31.985
Yeah, she's blowing
hard up here.

27:31.987 --> 27:34.988
Narrator: Darrell Ward is still
leading the pack with his

27:34.990 --> 27:37.991
triple-trailer backhaul.

27:37.993 --> 27:38.725
It started snowing.

27:38.727 --> 27:39.593
It's snowing pretty hard.

27:39.595 --> 27:41.562
I don't know, we've picked
up a couple inches.

27:41.564 --> 27:46.033
Narrator: But with every mile,
conditions are getting worse.

27:46.035 --> 27:51.205
That's not a good sign, when they're
sending that big boy up here.

27:51.207 --> 27:54.575
You can see the wind's starting
to pick up here already.

27:54.577 --> 27:58.079
We're going to get into a blow that
is going to be zero visibility.

27:58.081 --> 28:00.448
It's going to be terrible, these
roads are going to be slick.

28:00.450 --> 28:04.252
You know, I just come up behind the biggest
road grader you ever seen in your life.

28:04.254 --> 28:08.156
Big old "V" blade on the front,
winged up, and, you know, he's

28:08.158 --> 28:10.225
headed up here for a reason.

28:10.227 --> 28:14.997
Narrator: Two miles
ahead of Darrell...

28:14.999 --> 28:19.369
Carlile's Phil Kromm
is also pushing south.

28:19.371 --> 28:24.575
Freezing rain, blowing snow, and,
uh, it's a really kind of a

28:24.577 --> 28:27.911
tough day to be leaving town
with not knowing exactly what

28:27.913 --> 28:31.915
we're going to find out here.

28:31.917 --> 28:35.852
[On CB] We're liable to get our
asses handed to us up there.

28:35.854 --> 28:37.320
Yeah, copy that.

28:37.322 --> 28:39.589
Looks like once we get up
towards the top, we are gonna

28:39.591 --> 28:41.658
get in it a bit.

28:41.660 --> 28:44.461
It's liable to be pretty bad.

28:44.463 --> 28:47.163
Yeah, it's liable
to be real bad.

28:47.165 --> 28:52.501
We're probably going to
fight it all the way over.

28:52.503 --> 28:55.404
This stuff's really picking up
and moving, so I'm gonna go

28:55.406 --> 28:57.607
and see if we can
bust through it.

28:57.609 --> 29:04.180
Narrator: Up ahead, severe winter
weather is taking control.

29:04.182 --> 29:08.450
Packing 80-mile-per-hour winds
and heavy drifting snow, the

29:08.452 --> 29:12.855
storm is quickly
plugging up the road.

29:12.857 --> 29:17.793
In these conditions, trucks can
easily become stranded, trapping

29:17.795 --> 29:23.031
drivers for days in brutal
sub-zero temperatures.

29:30.974 --> 29:33.376
[On CB] We get up the other side,
and it just keeps getting

29:33.378 --> 29:35.779
worse and worse and worse.

29:35.781 --> 29:41.251
[On CB] Hey, Mike, this is
bullshit-- I ain't doing this.

29:41.253 --> 29:42.786
Everybody's turning around.

29:42.788 --> 29:45.455
Yep, Slope Mountain camp for me.

29:45.457 --> 29:51.127
Everybody's going back to slope
mountain camp, turning around.

29:54.732 --> 29:59.402
Narrator: - After an hour fighting the
weather... [On CB] - Darrell?

29:59.404 --> 30:00.904
Yes, sir.

30:00.906 --> 30:03.706
We gotta back 'em in right here
in this little pullout on

30:03.708 --> 30:06.408
top, drop 'em, and
go down to the camp.

30:06.410 --> 30:10.145
Narrator: Both drivers
decide to call it quits.

30:10.147 --> 30:13.081
They're saying it's
really, really nasty.

30:15.651 --> 30:18.286
It's changing fast.

30:18.288 --> 30:21.288
10-4.

30:23.758 --> 30:26.827
Narrator: - Trapped in the violent storm...
- We're going to drop our

30:26.829 --> 30:29.930
trailers here and go back
to Slope Mountain camp.

30:29.932 --> 30:33.099
We're not going to
get through this.

30:33.101 --> 30:36.036
Narrator: Darrell and Phil
drop their loads and run for

30:36.038 --> 30:39.005
cover at a nearby DOT camp.

31:26.859 --> 31:28.960
Pretty rough out there.

31:28.962 --> 31:31.896
I'm always one to want to push
through it, but sometimes you've

31:31.898 --> 31:38.403
got to throw in the towel, you
know, and admit a little defeat.

31:38.405 --> 31:43.775
Narrator: - 130 miles to the South...
[On CB] - We can only go

31:43.777 --> 31:46.611
30 mile an hour on this stretch.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.547
Narrator: Austin Wheeler is
running into the same storm that

31:49.549 --> 31:53.184
stopped Darrell and
Phil in their tracks.

31:53.186 --> 31:56.053
The roads just really suck
right now, once we got to the

31:56.055 --> 31:57.622
other side of Atigun Pass.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.056
The roads are just fucked.

31:59.058 --> 32:00.725
The wind's blowing really hard.

32:00.727 --> 32:02.693
You can barely see.

32:02.695 --> 32:06.230
The road's drifting really bad
with snow, so you just got to be

32:06.232 --> 32:07.564
careful going through here.

32:07.566 --> 32:11.768
Narrator: Running solo, Austin had
hoped to fly up the Dalton...

32:11.770 --> 32:13.603
We've got trucks off the road
here and trucks trying to pull

32:13.605 --> 32:15.771
them out.

32:15.773 --> 32:19.742
Narrator: But the winter weather
has slowed him to a crawl.

32:19.744 --> 32:22.177
There's a truck in the ditch
up here, one of our own, so

32:22.179 --> 32:27.582
we'll probably stop and see
if we can help him out.

32:27.584 --> 32:31.019
Narrator: A fellow Carlile
driver lost track of the road

32:31.021 --> 32:35.157
and wound up buried in the
ditch, backing up the Dalton.

32:35.159 --> 32:36.492
Hey, Austin.

32:36.494 --> 32:39.695
You and Jack think you
can pull me back?

32:39.697 --> 32:42.031
I'm not with Jack,
I'm by myself.

32:42.033 --> 32:44.401
I don't know, we can try.

32:44.403 --> 32:47.671
Okay Austin, come on up.

32:47.673 --> 32:50.807
Narrator: And with traffic at
a standstill, the only way

32:50.809 --> 32:55.112
through is for Austin to quickly
free the rig, before they all

32:55.114 --> 32:59.049
become hopelessly
trapped on the road.

33:01.419 --> 33:05.323
I'm going to try and help this
guy get out of the ditch.

33:24.243 --> 33:26.979
Oh, my God!

33:33.386 --> 33:36.021
Let me know when you're ready.

33:36.023 --> 33:38.624
All right, bud.

33:38.626 --> 33:40.760
Here we go.

33:45.999 --> 33:48.434
Hang on.

33:48.436 --> 33:50.903
Here we go again.

34:01.882 --> 34:05.285
You've gotta be kidding me.

34:05.287 --> 34:07.821
Come on!

34:07.889 --> 34:14.728
Narrator: 150 miles South of Coldfoot...
[Honking]

34:14.730 --> 34:17.398
Narrator: Jack Jessee is headed
towards the storm with a

34:17.400 --> 34:20.201
load of timber and
a pick-up truck.

34:20.203 --> 34:24.804
That dry river slide
is gonna be a bitch.

34:24.806 --> 34:25.973
Excellent.

34:25.975 --> 34:29.710
Need a little excitement
for the night.

34:29.712 --> 34:32.045
So I just talked to another
driver, said there was a big

34:32.047 --> 34:35.248
weather front moving through,
right around the Arctic Circle.

34:35.251 --> 34:38.619
It might get very
interesting tonight.

34:38.621 --> 34:44.058
So regardless of how early or
how late you get out of town,

34:44.060 --> 34:49.096
when the weather kicks up, it's
definitely going to slow you down.

34:53.601 --> 34:56.904
Narrator: On top of the massive
storm bearing down...

34:56.906 --> 35:01.209
[On CB] Hey, Jack, you got
a bad tire on your rear.

35:01.211 --> 35:03.811
Narrator: Jack's got
other problems.

35:03.813 --> 35:05.813
Oh, fuck.

35:08.750 --> 35:14.322
Uh, your rear tandem tire--
Outer is wobbling pretty bad.

35:14.324 --> 35:16.491
Uh, thanks a lot.

35:22.330 --> 35:26.566
That back one, it does
seem a little screwed up.

35:28.903 --> 35:34.341
Narrator: The frozen Dalton's hard
miles wreak havoc on equipment.

35:34.343 --> 35:39.180
If a loose wheel goes unnoticed,
it can break free,

35:39.182 --> 35:44.184
sending a 150-pound projectile
into oncoming traffic at over

35:44.186 --> 35:47.488
50 miles an hour.

35:55.164 --> 35:58.199
We're blocking this part of the
road here, but when you got

35:58.201 --> 36:01.169
to stop, you got to stop.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.715
I can see where it's
already lopsided.

36:12.717 --> 36:14.717
Look at that.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.454
That's what it's doing.

36:20.691 --> 36:23.026
I'm not really sure
what happened.

36:23.028 --> 36:27.697
Loose lug nuts, broken stud right
there, wheel's separating.

36:27.699 --> 36:30.133
Well, right now, we're
definitely at a standstill.

36:30.135 --> 36:32.769
I can't go down the road with
this thing wobbling like this.

36:32.771 --> 36:36.072
Narrator: Stuck on the side of
the road with a storm bearing

36:36.074 --> 36:41.978
- down... -So I'm pretty well stuck where
I'm at until I get this problem fixed.

36:41.980 --> 36:45.248
Narrator: The haul
road ace is stranded.

37:01.133 --> 37:02.967
Narrator: On the side
of the haul road...

37:02.969 --> 37:03.734
I don't know what happened.

37:03.736 --> 37:07.172
Lug nuts got loose, shrank,
came-- It doesn't matter.

37:07.174 --> 37:10.809
Narrator: Jack Jessee is at a
standstill with a busted trailer

37:10.811 --> 37:13.312
and a storm on the way.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.781
Can't have these things even
free-rolling, even if I took

37:15.783 --> 37:17.449
the weight off, 'cause it's
still going to break those

37:17.451 --> 37:22.387
studs, so I think what I'm going
to end up doing is, I'll go down

37:22.389 --> 37:24.389
the road with no wheel.

37:26.592 --> 37:31.062
Narrator: Desperate to get
back underway, Jack's plan is

37:31.064 --> 37:36.467
to remove the tires and turn
his big rig into a 16-wheeler.

37:36.469 --> 37:37.468
Okay.

37:40.272 --> 37:44.542
I'm hoping that chain can
pick the whole trailer up.

37:44.544 --> 37:46.377
See what happens.

37:49.313 --> 37:50.781
[Grinding]

37:52.317 --> 37:55.052
[Grinding]

37:55.054 --> 37:58.455
[Grunts]

37:58.457 --> 38:00.057
And the last one.

38:00.059 --> 38:03.660
We got her.

38:03.662 --> 38:09.499
And the cavalry arrived...
just as soon as I got done.

38:09.501 --> 38:10.868
There's one.

38:10.870 --> 38:13.103
Guys showed up right when I
really needed the help the

38:13.105 --> 38:14.671
most to load these tires up.

38:14.673 --> 38:15.772
All right guys, thanks!

38:15.774 --> 38:16.573
Yep, you're welcome.

38:16.575 --> 38:17.641
See you later.

38:17.643 --> 38:21.512
I say we go trucking now!

38:21.514 --> 38:24.682
People see you riding down the
road with no wheels out there,

38:24.684 --> 38:26.584
then they know
you've had problems.

38:26.586 --> 38:29.320
But they also know you fixed
them and you overcome them.

38:29.322 --> 38:32.490
Narrator: Jack's back on the
road, but the fix cost him

38:32.492 --> 38:38.763
precious time, and with a storm
raging up ahead, Jack's calling

38:38.765 --> 38:40.866
it a night in Coldfoot.

38:40.868 --> 38:44.236
It's definitely not the way
I want to end a long day.

38:44.238 --> 38:48.941
Narrator: While the
veteran packs it in...

38:48.943 --> 38:52.511
Austin's still determined
to reach Prudhoe Bay.

38:52.513 --> 38:53.913
Here we go again.

38:53.915 --> 38:58.184
Narrator: He's fighting to
clear a 105,000-pound tanker

38:58.186 --> 39:00.754
that's blocking the road...

39:03.958 --> 39:06.893
But the truck refuses to budge.

39:08.796 --> 39:13.734
I don't know if that would work.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.548
Damn this wind.

39:27.550 --> 39:32.920
Narrator: With every passing second,
blowing snow buries the big rig deeper.

39:32.922 --> 39:36.224
I might be able to pull
it out from the front.

39:36.226 --> 39:38.159
Worth a try.

39:38.161 --> 39:41.195
Narrator: And with a line of
stuck trucks building on the

39:41.197 --> 39:43.564
- road behind him...
- Okay, Bill, I'm going to try

39:43.566 --> 39:45.767
to come around you here.

39:45.769 --> 39:49.070
Narrator: Austin takes one
last shot at freeing them all

39:49.072 --> 39:50.672
from the crippling storm.

39:50.674 --> 39:55.677
Let me disconnect you
from me here-- Hold on.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.157
All right.

40:11.629 --> 40:12.963
Ready?

40:12.965 --> 40:15.131
Yup-- Yeah, I am.

40:22.707 --> 40:24.674
Come on!

40:41.958 --> 40:43.926
Wahoo!

40:52.968 --> 40:54.936
Whoo!

41:07.283 --> 41:10.552
Narrator: With the truck free and
the road cleared, Austin and

41:10.554 --> 41:15.356
the rest of the drivers are
once again rolling north.

41:18.261 --> 41:22.297
Well, the Qualcomm said
zero visibility out here.

41:22.299 --> 41:24.566
That ain't stopping us.

41:24.568 --> 41:28.370
Now I'm leading the convoy
to Prudhoe, all chained up.

41:28.372 --> 41:32.408
I ain't going to lie, I just
feel like a total badass today.

41:34.678 --> 41:38.181
Narrator: Austin's back
underway, but until he reaches

41:38.183 --> 41:45.022
Prudhoe Bay, Darrell Ward is all
alone at the top of the load count.

41:49.594 --> 41:55.699
- Back on the haul road...
- Oh, I see lights out there to the left.

41:55.701 --> 42:00.872
Narrator: Another
truck is in trouble.

42:00.874 --> 42:04.476
[On CB] Yeah, I was following
tracks, I'm almost in the tracks

42:04.478 --> 42:08.847
and it looks like the berm, you
know, is 8 feet over, but...

42:08.849 --> 42:11.649
I-I don't know what the hell it
is, but I don't think that's

42:11.651 --> 42:14.185
road over there.

42:14.187 --> 42:18.223
Narrator: The stranded driver
has lost track of the road...

42:18.225 --> 42:20.225
See if we can help him out.

42:20.227 --> 42:25.964
Narrator: And batting a thousand, Austin
decides to attempt another rescue.

42:25.966 --> 42:27.966
Here I go.

42:40.279 --> 42:48.486
Narrator: But this time, the rookie...
has run out of luck.

42:48.488 --> 42:50.788
[Sighs]

42:57.662 --> 43:01.631
I'm stuck here...
because I've been trying to

43:01.633 --> 43:05.935
play the fucking savior
and help everybody.

43:12.175 --> 43:14.643
Narrator: Next time on
<i>Ice Road Truckers...</i>
