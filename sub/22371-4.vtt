(sighs)

01:15.993 --> 01:17.984
(music playing)

02:10.547 --> 02:12.538
(Shiva growling softly)

03:06.728 --> 03:08.935
Fear not, young master Henry.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.263
You will be brave.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.067
Because you are brave.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.716
We face dire challenge and chance.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.800
Our lives...

03:44.808 --> 03:46.219
our way of life...

03:47.936 --> 03:49.552
it hangs in the balance...

03:51.022 --> 03:53.559
a fragile glass standing on a wire,

03:53.650 --> 03:55.436
high above the asphalt,

03:55.527 --> 03:59.896
as we pray for not one drop of rain
under an overcast sky.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.111
And yet, I smile.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.327
We will fight,

04:10.417 --> 04:12.658
and we will bleed...

04:13.462 --> 04:15.328
and yet I smile.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.089
We shall face men,

04:19.176 --> 04:22.214
some cornered into their roles
by circumstance,

04:22.304 --> 04:25.797
some desperate murderers
thrilled by blood.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.474
We shall end them all.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.597
As is our charge this day.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.270
As is our sorrow.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.109
And yet, I smile.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.486
We will leave our loved ones...

04:44.576 --> 04:46.692
to traverse a dangerous road.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.907
Rushing out of peace into war.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.207
And yet, I smile.

04:59.758 --> 05:03.843
For we will mine glory
from the rock of struggle this day.

05:04.763 --> 05:08.222
We will honor and protect this--
this bastion of life

05:08.308 --> 05:11.551
in a land of the dead,
and we will win.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.894
You trust the king-- we will win.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.016
I smile...

05:19.110 --> 05:21.977
I laugh...

05:22.072 --> 05:24.609
I rejoice this day...

05:24.699 --> 05:26.656
for on this day,

05:26.743 --> 05:30.236
we are joined in purpose and vision--

05:30.330 --> 05:33.448
we are of a singular heart and mind.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.829
On this day, we are one!

05:35.919 --> 05:37.535
- Yeah!
- (crowd murmuring)

05:37.629 --> 05:39.211
- Woman: Yes.
- Man: Yeah!

05:39.297 --> 05:40.662
We are one!

Ezekiel: We are one!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.676
Man #2: Yeah!

Ezekiel: We are one!

05:47.305 --> 05:49.672

12:42.762 --> 12:44.799

12:44.889 --> 12:47.472
What you need is to hurry your asses up!

If you're not out of here with those guns
by the time I round this corner,

I am gonna flay your asses!

12:52.522 --> 12:53.683

13:06.911 --> 13:09.369
- What the hell?
- What?

13:09.455 --> 13:11.537
Those are the only
.50-cal buckets we got?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.707
Got the rest in the pool.
This was just to tear 'em up.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.459
Forgot about your blade.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.583
Give it to me.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.040
It's how I can walk.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.171
You can keep the cane.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.475
I'm gonna need your help.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.058
We got a big trip ahead of us.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.689
- (groans) Where?
- Guess.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.734
The Sanctuary?

15:50.825 --> 15:52.532
That's right.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.493
The gates are down.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.446
It's surrounded by the dead.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.282
They can't get out. We can't get in.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.494
Well, maybe you can help me

16:03.588 --> 16:05.295
get our big guns over there

16:05.381 --> 16:07.918
to help remedy that situation.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.448
Yago:
Ammo's in the truck?

16:33.534 --> 16:37.402

17:07.944 --> 17:09.355
You made it this long.

17:09.444 --> 17:12.858
After pulling all the crap you did,
you're gonna lie down now?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.781
Better the dead be my end

17:14.867 --> 17:17.575

17:17.662 --> 17:19.368
Tell me...

17:19.454 --> 17:21.412
does Negan know your name?

17:24.417 --> 17:26.000
I'm Negan.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.036
Get up.

Yeah, I heard your story.

Let's go. Now. Move!

17:52.905 --> 17:55.613
You work at a circus?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.190
No.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.822
Yeah, I thought maybe, but nah.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.995
They don't treat animals
too nice at the circus.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.699
And that cat just loves you.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.834
It gave you everything, didn't it?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.504
Gave you an angle, a story.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.839
Got to hand it to you--

18:13.926 --> 18:15.837
you played your cards good.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.340
You played "your people" good.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.006
They ate that horseshit right up.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.431
Uaughs)

18:22.518 --> 18:24.634
They grew food for you.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.640
Built those walls for you.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.313
Hell, look at that.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.935
(chuckles)

18:30.026 --> 18:33.018
You got them all killed--
they're still following you.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.444
But take away that tiger...

18:35.531 --> 18:37.238
what's left?

18:37.325 --> 18:41.910

20:09.291 --> 20:10.952
We're getting into something with wheels,

Negan was hoping to have your ass

chained to the Sanctuary fence...

You, the Widow...

will do just fine.

avoid the obvious symmetry.

You have to promise. Please!

Hey, do you wanna die?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.528
I asked you
where your people are--

25:00.916 --> 25:03.203
Lower your guns now!

You were lying to us
about your friends, huh?

27:09.837 --> 27:11.919
Yeah. I was.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.837
Now, we need to end this.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.382
Okay. Walk away, lady.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.756
You're not going anywhere
with those guns.

27:19.847 --> 27:24.216
(scoffs) Nah. We are.
They got someplace to be.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.303
I've got your pal's ammo.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.980
How many bullets you got left
after all those walkers?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.397
Three? Four?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.191
Why don't you come at us
and find out?

27:34.278 --> 27:35.860
We're right here.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.489
(gunshots)

27:52.087 --> 27:54.203
Honey, let's keep talking.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.790
We got all the time in the world.

28:05.809 --> 28:09.018
Have you ever fought before?

28:09.104 --> 28:11.220
You've seen me fight.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.022
Before this.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.184
The dead.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.440
A marauder in the woods once.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.612
- You fought him?
- Yes.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.908
Me... then Shiva.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.496
I have trained for a very long time.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.244
And I have continued,

28:31.335 --> 28:33.918
from long before this till now.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.996
And I have practiced for days on end.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.502
I am ready to become what I must.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.086
"To become"?

28:45.057 --> 28:46.639
Yes.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.309
To will myself into what I must be.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.017
I was a zookeeper.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.901
I was... meek.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.693
Those weekend matinees, those nights.

29:05.160 --> 29:10.075
And then, at work,
a 500-pound tiger needed my help.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.582
And as she bled...

29:13.669 --> 29:16.957
I did not just leap into her enclosure.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.085
I was not seized by any...

29:21.176 --> 29:24.009
deep-seated instinct.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.630
They were only...

29:27.724 --> 29:30.432
a few seconds that passed...

29:30.519 --> 29:32.009
but I deliberated.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.145
I thought about doing it,

29:35.232 --> 29:39.317
weighing the risk
of approaching such a beast.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.604
And I thought about not doing it.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.404
I stood there,
considering who I'd be

29:47.494 --> 29:49.280
in either iteration.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.329
And I decided I wanted to be
the one who leapt.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.712
So, many years later...

29:59.798 --> 30:03.132
Benjamin was the one who told me
what I already knew,

30:03.218 --> 30:05.459
but couldn't hear...

30:08.307 --> 30:11.140
"if you're asked to be the hero...

30:11.226 --> 30:13.934
be the hero."

30:14.021 --> 30:16.558
I'm now ready.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.389
Finally.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.941
I've deliberated.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.861
I've made the decision on who I will be.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.823
Was it easier for you?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.949
Or have you always been this way?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.575
This strong?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.155
This brave?

30:36.543 --> 30:39.831
Or did you decide to be
who you are today?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.502
I decided.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.834
Just like you.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.924
But life decided some things, too.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.686
It does.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.065
It will.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.992
(gunfire)

31:34.643 --> 31:36.133
Are you okay?

31:36.228 --> 31:38.595
Did they get the guns?

31:38.688 --> 31:40.429
Nothing we can do about it.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.825
I've got the King.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.903
(grunting)

32:01.837 --> 32:03.748
We have to get word to Rick!

32:03.839 --> 32:06.752
If they ferry those machine guns
to the Sanctuary...

32:06.842 --> 32:08.753
(engine revs in distance)

32:11.930 --> 32:14.672
They're not getting them
to the Sanctuary.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.687
(engine revving)

34:24.187 --> 34:26.303
(screams)

34:56.678 --> 34:58.669
(leaves rustling)

35:00.432 --> 35:02.799
Rick: Hey.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.883
(grunting)

35:11.985 --> 35:14.693
(panting)

35:22.537 --> 35:24.653
We got the guns.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.197
You look like shit.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.915
Let's go see if this asshole's alive.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.672
(walkers growling distance)

35:50.565 --> 35:52.522
(Ezekiel grunting)

35:56.071 --> 35:57.903
Jerry: Your Majesty!

35:57.989 --> 36:00.196
This ain't gonna work.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.524
You gotta leave me.
I'm slowing you down.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.701
No. You don't get to do that.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.948
Come on. I'm almost out of ammo.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.203
(grunting)

36:46.746 --> 36:48.862
I can't... You can't.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.743
You two have to just go.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.324
(grunts)

36:52.419 --> 36:55.252
Lower him down to me.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.366
Carol: Ezekiel!

37:26.453 --> 37:28.740
Just go! I'll hold them off!

37:28.830 --> 37:31.197
Carol: Ezekiel, we can get you away.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.077
Ezekiel: You can't!

37:33.168 --> 37:35.250
I can't leave you, Your Majesty.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.373
Come on, man, just go!

37:37.464 --> 37:40.001
- You're my king!
- No, I'm not!

37:40.091 --> 37:42.207
I'm not your King!

37:42.302 --> 37:44.043
I'm not "Your Majesty"!

37:47.223 --> 37:48.839
Look at what's in front of us!

37:49.934 --> 37:51.925
That's what's real!

37:53.021 --> 37:56.434
Go.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.891
I ain't no king!

37:59.736 --> 38:01.272
I ain't nothing.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.942
I'm just some guy.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.944
Some guy who found...

38:07.035 --> 38:08.946
(Shiva growling)

38:09.037 --> 38:10.778
Shiva...

38:13.708 --> 38:15.449
Carol: Come on.

38:23.718 --> 38:28.053
Shiva!

38:28.139 --> 38:29.721
Run, girl!

38:32.477 --> 38:34.559
- No! No!
- (growling continues)

38:40.568 --> 38:42.150
Please, Jerry!

38:43.071 --> 38:44.982
Damn it, let me help her!

38:45.073 --> 38:46.689
(flesh tearing)

38:48.076 --> 38:49.942
You can't.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.612
(walkers growling)

39:25.363 --> 39:27.570
(groans)

41:06.047 --> 41:08.038
(theme music playing)
