00:15.133 --> 00:18.567
Hi, today, you're gonna hear
some nursery rhymes

00:18.567 --> 00:21.700
- and meet some nursery rhyme
characters like...
-  ( bell ringing )

00:21.700 --> 00:24.166
- Me!
- The cow who jumped
over the moon.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.400
Watch this.
Ha ha ha!

00:25.400 --> 00:27.700
- What, what?
- Alley-oop!

00:27.700 --> 00:29.500
Whoa!

00:29.500 --> 00:32.533
( Cow groaning )

00:32.533 --> 00:36.633
Wha-- you're-you're supposed
to jump over the moon, not me!

00:36.633 --> 00:38.367
Ohh. Sorry.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.567
I just need a teensy bit
more practice.

00:40.567 --> 00:43.000
Watch for more
nursery rhyme characters

00:43.000 --> 00:45.166
on "Sesame Street."

00:45.166 --> 00:47.834
Kids:

01:13.567 --> 01:15.200

01:15.200 --> 01:17.600

01:17.600 --> 01:20.367
- Yeah, me neither,
Elmo. Ha ha ha!
- Yeah-eah-eah!

01:20.367 --> 01:22.667
Oh, hey!
Welcome to "Sesame Street."

01:22.667 --> 01:23.834
Oh, ho ho! Hi!

01:23.834 --> 01:25.967
Oh. Guess who's
coming today.

01:25.967 --> 01:27.834
- You'll never guess.
- It's Mother Goose!

01:27.834 --> 01:29.367
- Yeah!
- Yeah, the Mother Goose.

01:29.367 --> 01:31.266
It's-it's time!
It's time, everybody!

01:31.266 --> 01:32.900
It's time! Settle down,
settle down, settle--

01:32.900 --> 01:34.633
- Yay!
- Yes!

01:34.633 --> 01:37.767
And now the moment
we've all been
waiting for--

01:37.767 --> 01:40.033
that incredible
nursery rhyme writer

01:40.033 --> 01:41.934
Mother Goose!

01:41.934 --> 01:45.000
( cheering )

01:45.000 --> 01:46.834
Can someone please help me
with my book?

01:46.834 --> 01:48.467
Oh, sure.
Elmo can help you.

01:48.467 --> 01:49.667
I got it, I got it,
I got it, Elmo!

01:49.667 --> 01:50.967
I got it, I got it!

01:50.967 --> 01:54.700
Ohh! Ohh!

01:54.700 --> 01:56.934
Oh, wow! That's heavy.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.433
Okay.

01:58.433 --> 01:59.767
All right.
There's the big book.

01:59.767 --> 02:02.000
Okay.
Wow! Thank you.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.266
Well, I've written a lot
of nursery rhymes, you know.

02:04.266 --> 02:06.667
I have a talent
for telling stories that rhyme.

02:06.667 --> 02:07.900
I do it all the time.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.633
Hey! You just rhymed there.

02:10.633 --> 02:13.667
"Rhyme" and "time"
end in the same sound.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.934
I did! You're right!
I did!

02:15.934 --> 02:17.700
Yeah!

02:17.700 --> 02:19.734
Telly:
Which nursery rhyme
are you going to

02:19.734 --> 02:21.400
read for us today,
Mother Goose?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.000
Hmm.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.200
Well, I thought
I would begin by reading

02:25.200 --> 02:27.500
a rhyme about
a cow friend of mine

02:27.500 --> 02:29.066
who likes to jump
over the moon.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.500
Elmo:
Oh, oh! That's
"Hey diddle diddle!"

02:30.500 --> 02:32.100
That's
"Hey diddle diddle!"

02:32.100 --> 02:34.233
- You know it?
- Of course! Oh!

02:34.233 --> 02:36.700
That's Elmo's favorite,
Miss Mother Goose.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.967
Ooh. He's got good taste.

02:38.967 --> 02:40.266
Thank you!

02:40.266 --> 02:42.433
That's a good rhyme.
All right.

02:42.433 --> 02:43.734
( whistles )

02:43.734 --> 02:45.100
Meow!

02:45.100 --> 02:46.233
We begin.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.400
"Hey diddle diddle,
the cat and the fiddle."

02:49.400 --> 02:51.800
♪ Mraww mraww
mraww mraww ♪

02:51.800 --> 02:54.233
♪ Mraww mraww
mraww mraww ♪

02:54.233 --> 02:55.467
Mrrraww!

02:55.467 --> 02:57.100
- Ooh!
- Ha ha!

02:57.100 --> 02:59.567
- The cow...
- ( Cow panting )

02:59.567 --> 03:01.867
jumped over the moon.

03:01.867 --> 03:03.400
Oh! Oh, that's me.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.066
Hoo hoo hoo!
Here I go!

03:05.066 --> 03:06.967
Alley-oop!

03:09.900 --> 03:11.300
Ugh! Ohh!

03:11.300 --> 03:13.767
( all laughing )

03:13.767 --> 03:16.133
That was amazing.

03:16.133 --> 03:19.066
Oh, dear.
Well, good catch.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.400
Uh, thanks?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.867
The little dog
laughed to see such sport...

03:23.867 --> 03:25.033
Ha ha ha!

03:25.033 --> 03:26.100
What a sport!

03:26.100 --> 03:28.033
Hee hee hee!

03:28.033 --> 03:30.500
And the dish ran away
with the spoon.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.900
Niagara Falls,
here we come!

03:32.900 --> 03:34.200
Whee!

03:34.200 --> 03:35.767
That was unbelievable!

03:35.767 --> 03:37.433
( laughter and applause )

03:37.433 --> 03:39.400
Will you read another
nursery rhyme for us,

03:39.400 --> 03:40.834
Mother Goose?

03:40.834 --> 03:42.934
Please, oh, please,
oh, please, oh, please.

03:42.934 --> 03:44.567
I don't know.
I could.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.333
Come on, come on.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.500
- Please, please.
- Please, please, please.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.367
All:
More, more, more, more!

03:51.367 --> 03:54.033
Okay, okay.
I will, I will.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.166
( all cheering )

03:55.166 --> 03:57.100
Yay, Mother Goose!

03:57.100 --> 04:00.266
I'll read one about, uh,
a friend of mine who
was afraid of spiders.

04:00.266 --> 04:01.900
- Ooh!
- Elmo: Oh, oh,

04:01.900 --> 04:05.467
- That's
"Little Miss Muffet!"
- ( whistles )

04:05.467 --> 04:07.767
Elmo:
Miss Muffet! Ha ha ha!

04:07.767 --> 04:09.467
Yeah-eah-eah!

04:09.467 --> 04:11.600
Ahh, ahh.
All right. Here we go.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.233
Ahhheem!

04:13.233 --> 04:16.233
Little Miss Muffet
sat on a tuffet,

04:16.233 --> 04:18.433
eating her curds
and whey.

04:18.433 --> 04:20.800
Oh, that's good
curds and whey! Oh!

04:20.800 --> 04:23.633
Along came a spider,
who sat down beside her

04:23.633 --> 04:26.200
and frightened
Miss Muffet away.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.900
Hmm! Boo.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.467
Aah! Aah!
A spider!

04:29.467 --> 04:31.433
Ohh! That's too many legs!
Too many legs!

04:31.433 --> 04:34.300
Ha ha ha!
That was cool!

04:34.300 --> 04:35.600
Let's hear it
for Mother Goose

04:35.600 --> 04:37.166
and all of her characters!

04:37.166 --> 04:38.800
( all cheering )

04:38.800 --> 04:40.433
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.600
Goose, goose,
goose, goose!

04:41.600 --> 04:42.800
Telly: And now,

04:42.800 --> 04:46.166
refreshments will be served
in Hooper's store.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.734
( all cheering )

04:47.734 --> 04:50.467
Yeah-eah-eah!

04:50.467 --> 04:52.133
Refresh yourselves.

04:52.133 --> 04:55.033
Oh, oh, excuse Elmo,
Miss Mother Goose.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.066
Does Mother Goose
need help with her book?

04:57.066 --> 04:59.100
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.000
Yes, I do.
That's--

05:01.000 --> 05:02.767
that's very kind
of you, very helpful.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.300
- Elmo: Well...
- What a nice monster
you are.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.300
Thank you!

05:05.300 --> 05:06.967
I-- ha!

05:06.967 --> 05:09.800
I should write
a nursery rhyme about you.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.600
Really?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.033
Yes. What--
what's your name.

05:13.033 --> 05:14.200
Oh. Elmo.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.767
- Say it again. Eh--
- Elmo.

05:15.767 --> 05:18.500
Elmo.
Well, what a fun name.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.133
I've never written
a nursery rhyme

05:20.133 --> 05:21.500
about a monster before.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.200
I think it's going
to be a good time.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.200
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Chris, Abby!

05:26.200 --> 05:28.667
Mother Goose is going
to write a nursery rhyme

05:28.667 --> 05:30.133
about Elmo!

05:30.133 --> 05:31.467
Abby:
Wow, Elmo!

05:31.467 --> 05:33.500
- Your very own nursery rhyme!
- Yeah-eah-eah!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
Awesome, buddy.
I can't wait to hear it,

05:35.200 --> 05:36.400
but you know what?

05:36.400 --> 05:37.667
I better get going.

05:37.667 --> 05:38.800
Hooper's is getting
pretty busy there,

05:38.800 --> 05:40.100
but I will see you later.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.467
- Bye, Chris.
- Abby: Bye, Chris!

05:41.467 --> 05:42.567
See you later.

05:42.567 --> 05:43.800
Enjoy.
We have work to do.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.967
A new creation
is born today,

05:47.967 --> 05:50.734
and it is-- ohh!

05:50.734 --> 05:51.967
I've got it. Okay.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.100
Okay.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.700
- Hey diddle diddle...
- Ooh!

05:54.700 --> 05:56.467
The cat and the fiddle...

05:56.467 --> 05:59.266
the monster jumped
over the moon.

05:59.266 --> 06:01.633
Abby and Elmo:
The moon?

06:01.633 --> 06:03.266
Well, Mother Goose,
that was a wonderful rhyme.

06:03.266 --> 06:04.266
Mother Goose:
Thank you.

06:04.266 --> 06:06.834
It was very moving,
but, um,

06:06.834 --> 06:09.200
Elmo can't jump
over the moon.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.467
- He can't?
- No.

06:10.467 --> 06:11.767
Oh, I thought everyone
could jump over the moon.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.000
Not Elmo.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.200
Maybe you can if you get
a running start.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.000
Oh! That's a good idea.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.233
- Okay.
- All right.

06:18.233 --> 06:19.433
Elmo will try,
Mother Goose.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.100
Okay. Have fun.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.333
Thank you!

06:22.333 --> 06:25.567
Fly swift and strong,
my little monster.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.266
Okay. Here we go!

06:27.266 --> 06:28.700
Whoa, oh, oh!

06:28.700 --> 06:29.934
Elmo!

06:29.934 --> 06:32.567
Ha ha ha! Oh, boy.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.500
Mother Goose:
Oh, dear. Okay.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.633
- Oh, thank you.
- Mother Goose: Good as new.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.033
Well, Elmo didn't
get close to the moon,

06:38.033 --> 06:40.233
but, you know,
Mother Goose,

06:40.233 --> 06:43.600
Elmo doesn't think that
this nursery rhyme
is right for Elmo.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.900
Uh-huh.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.066
Well, maybe you can
write another

06:46.066 --> 06:47.800
nursery rhyme
for him, Mother Goose.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.400
Oh, yeah!

06:49.400 --> 06:51.300
Yes, yes,
of course I can.
I'm Mother Goose.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.667
Mother Goose.

06:52.667 --> 06:53.967
Oh-- ah-- ooh!
I've got it. Okay.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.100
- Elmo...
- Uh-huh?

06:55.100 --> 06:56.233
- My sweet.
- Yes.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.734
How do you feel
about spiders?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.700
If you were, say,
to sit on, I don't know,

06:59.700 --> 07:02.867
a tuffet and one came along,
would you be frightened away?

07:02.867 --> 07:04.233
No. Elmo loves spiders.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.367
They're cool!

07:05.367 --> 07:07.266
Ha ha ha!

07:07.266 --> 07:08.367
Okay. Scratch that.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.667
Uh-- ooh! I've got it.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.867
Hey. Little Elmo Blue,
come...

07:11.867 --> 07:14.033
♪ Blow your Horn ♪

07:14.033 --> 07:16.000
Yeah. You're red.
He's red.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.633
Uh, okay.

07:17.633 --> 07:20.500
Have you ever fallen down
and broken your crown?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.533
Whoa, oh, oh!

07:22.533 --> 07:24.533
No, but, uh, Elmo fell off his
tricycle once.

07:24.533 --> 07:26.934
Abby:
But he got right back up!

07:26.934 --> 07:28.266
Right back up!

07:28.266 --> 07:30.867
Whoo.
Guys, I'm losing it.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.533
Elmo, I...

07:32.533 --> 07:35.000
I don't know if I can write
a nursery rhyme about you.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.200
I don't know anything
about you, really.

07:38.200 --> 07:43.700
Oh, well, um,
that's okay, Mother Goose.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.367
Thank you for trying.

07:45.367 --> 07:48.500
I'm sorry.
I did my best.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.867
Ooh.

07:49.867 --> 07:52.100
- Uh, Mother Goose?
- Yes?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
I could tell
you about Elmo.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.300
He's my friend.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.633
You could? Really?

07:56.633 --> 07:58.000
I think that would
be very helpful.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.300
- Oh!
- Okay.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.633
Tell me everything
you know.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.967
Well, um--
well, he's very kind.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.333
Ooh, yes!
Oh, you're right.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.500
He tried to help me
with my book.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.767
Mm-hmm. Go on.

08:06.767 --> 08:07.967
Yeah, he did.
Um-- oh!

08:07.967 --> 08:09.433
He really likes
to share. Yeah.

08:09.433 --> 08:10.867
Ooh! I love that.

08:10.867 --> 08:13.266
He lets me hold his
little baby David doll
all the time.

08:13.266 --> 08:14.433
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.600
So he shares.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.367
- Ohh! Abby!
- What?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.166
I feel a rhyme
coming on.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.200
- You do?!
- Okay.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.667
The inspiration
has struck.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.133
Ow! It feels like
a stomach ache.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.900
Ooh! Okay! Oh!

08:25.900 --> 08:27.300
Where's my pen?

08:27.300 --> 08:29.533
Boy, this is exciting!
Ha ha ha!

08:29.533 --> 08:30.767
Welcome back,
everybody.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.400
Welcome back.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.734
Mother Goose has just
written a new nursery rhyme,

08:36.734 --> 08:38.533
and we are going
to be the first ones

08:38.533 --> 08:41.500
to hear it.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.567
Boy, Elmo wonders
what it's gonna be about.

08:43.567 --> 08:46.033
Oh, you'll see.

08:46.033 --> 08:47.233
It's my world premiere,

08:47.233 --> 08:51.133
and I think it might
be my best yet.

08:51.133 --> 08:55.066
It's about
a monster called Elmo.

08:55.066 --> 08:57.066
Bu-- Elmo?

08:57.066 --> 08:59.200
Oh, but Elmo thought
that Mother Goose

08:59.200 --> 09:01.433
couldn't write
about Elmo.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.700
Well, I thought so, too,
but that's because
I didn't know enough

09:03.700 --> 09:06.000
about you, Elmo,
but your friend Abby

09:06.000 --> 09:08.834
was kind enough to tell me
some of the things that

09:08.834 --> 09:13.100
make you special,
and it was a lot,
enough for a long rhyme.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.367
Let's go.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.600
Okay!

09:15.600 --> 09:18.467
Ah-ah-ah-hem.

09:18.467 --> 09:20.400
"Hey diddle donster."

09:20.400 --> 09:22.934
Hey diddle donster,
Elmo's a monster

09:22.934 --> 09:25.000
who's as kind as kind
can be.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.500
- Aww.
- Wow.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.333
Hey diddle donster,
a red furry monster

09:29.333 --> 09:32.033
who's helpful, uh,
to you and me.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.467
Ooh!

09:33.467 --> 09:36.400
He's great at sharing
and riding his trike.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.800
Cat: Mraww.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.867
He's the kind of monster
you got to like.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.100
( all laughing )

09:42.100 --> 09:44.934
Mother Goose:
Hey diddle donster,
Elmo's a monster

09:44.934 --> 09:47.033
- who likes to play pretend.
- Elmo: That's true.

09:47.033 --> 09:50.133
Hey diddle donster,
a red furry monster

09:50.133 --> 09:52.767
I'd like
to call my friend.

09:52.767 --> 09:55.467
All: Aww!

09:55.467 --> 09:58.000
That was so sweet.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.567
Chris:
Now, see, that is
my favorite nursery rhyme.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.233
Abby:
Me, too!

10:02.233 --> 10:03.333
Thank you,
Mother Goose,

10:03.333 --> 10:06.166
for making a nursery rhyme
about Elmo.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.367
Elmo loves it!
Ha ha ha!

10:08.367 --> 10:11.967
Yeah! It had so many things
that make Elmo special in it.

10:11.967 --> 10:13.800
Elmo:
Oh, oh, mother goose!

10:13.800 --> 10:15.834
Elmo would love
to be your friend.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.533
Oh, good! I'd love
to be your friend, too,

10:18.533 --> 10:21.834

to find out more
about you, Elmo.

about nursery rhymes.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.433

I'm kind of an expert,

didn't see that.

wondering about today.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.200
more about them.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.934
Hey, hey, hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend Smartie!

21:00.934 --> 21:02.900
Let's call her together.

Hi, Smartie.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.667
Oh, Smartie looks great!

I dressed up as
my favorite nursery rhyme.

♪ Twinkle, twinkle,

21:19.300 --> 21:20.700
( both laughing )

21:20.700 --> 21:22.467
Well, that's perfect,
Smartie,

21:22.467 --> 21:25.700
because Elmo wants to learn
all about nursery rhymes.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.433
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:28.433 --> 21:31.433
All:
We look it up!

21:31.433 --> 21:34.567
Getting the story
on nursery rhymes.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.900
Smartie:
A nursery rhyme is
a short poem or a song

21:36.900 --> 21:39.700
that rhymes
and can tell a story.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.867
Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.533
Jack jumped
over the candlestick.

Three pieces of this
puzzle are missing.

22:23.433 --> 22:26.633
Let's see if we can
put them in their right place.

22:26.633 --> 22:28.166

22:35.300 --> 22:37.834
Elmo:
Now how about this piece?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.300
Kid:
It's part of the wall.

22:46.266 --> 22:48.166
Oh, that's weird.
It's not fitting.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.100
Kid:

22:55.600 --> 22:58.667
Wow. Elmo really loves
nursery rhymes.

22:58.667 --> 23:02.133

Elmo wonder even more.

23:02.133 --> 23:05.233
Does Mr. Noodle have
a favorite nursery rhyme?

23:05.233 --> 23:06.500
Let's ask him!

23:22.767 --> 23:25.800

has lost something.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.066
Elmo:
Little Bo Peep
lost her luggage?

23:49.066 --> 23:52.700
No! Elmo doesn't think
that's right, Mr. Noodle.

23:52.700 --> 23:55.500

24:03.734 --> 24:07.033
Those pancakes do look
light and fluffy, Mr. Noodle,

24:07.033 --> 24:09.867
