00:12.273 --> 00:14.318
- No, that's-
- Get out of the store.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.667
- You don't belong here.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.756
Take your kids and
get out of the store.

[fist punches]

00:21.195 --> 00:23.197
Get out of the store,
you don't belong here.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.850
[all yelling]

00:24.894 --> 00:27.070
- You put your hands
on my goddamn son.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.593
- Let's go do it outside.

00:28.637 --> 00:31.248
- That's not your
seed, that's my seed.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.162
- Oh, we'll take it outside.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.164
- Here are the cops, come here.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.165
[all yelling]

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- You ever gonna stop,

00:36.732 --> 00:38.690
you're gonna get
arrested right now.

00:38.734 --> 00:39.996
- Don't touch my things.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.519
- [Officer] Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.520
- What is the problem?

00:42.564 --> 00:43.521
What's going on here?

00:43.565 --> 00:44.696
- We are under attack.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.784
They're looting and rioting.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.090
- Who are they?

00:47.134 --> 00:48.091
- The Blacks

00:48.135 --> 00:49.701
all of the Blacks.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.094
- Is this what y'all
called in as a riot?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.617
- [Together] Yes!

00:52.661 --> 00:53.618
[all yelling]

00:53.662 --> 00:55.142
- Stop, stop, stop.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.274
- And I know you're
not taking me to jail

00:57.318 --> 00:59.102
'cause this bitch
slapped my son.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.147
- Her son is a thief.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.626
- They're all thieves.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.106
They come here
every day, stealing,

01:03.150 --> 01:05.500
taking away from us
inch by inch by inch.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.937
- Man, they fightin'
Jovan and he only 12.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.547
- These people, they come
in here causing trouble.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.201
- Oh, shut the fuck
up, motherfucker.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.029
You are the one
that slapped my son.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.030

01:14.074 --> 01:16.554
[all yelling]

01:18.600 --> 01:20.123
- Look, look, how about this.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.907
Everybody's fightin',
everybody's disorderly,

01:21.951 --> 01:23.170
everybody's going to jail.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.911
[all yelling]

01:25.955 --> 01:27.521
Sit down! Sit down!

01:28.958 --> 01:31.700
- Man, I can't
believe this, man.

01:37.836 --> 01:40.143
[gentle music]

01:48.282 --> 01:51.110
[mind statics]

01:56.551 --> 01:59.206
[Jay screaming]

02:03.819 --> 02:06.082
- Okay, I'm up, I'm up.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.039
Oh, I'm up.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.655
Okay, asshole.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.193
[door closes]

02:32.239 --> 02:32.978
[Jay gasps]

02:33.022 --> 02:33.849
Jesus?

02:35.067 --> 02:36.895
- I live here, remember?

02:36.939 --> 02:38.680
- I didn't know
that you were here.

02:40.116 --> 02:41.944
- What I look like?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.206
I know how night work on you.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.165
I come home.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.645
I ain't got no
curfew, but I pull up.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.823
[refrigerator slams]

02:51.867 --> 02:54.348
[Darrell scoffs]

[utensils clank]

03:15.282 --> 03:18.328
[knife chops loudly]

03:20.765 --> 03:22.202
- What time did you get here?

03:26.771 --> 03:30.688
- I don't know, mom, but
you were sound asleep.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.086
- Darrell, if you come
in creeping at night,

03:37.129 --> 03:39.131
then it's like you were not here

03:39.175 --> 03:41.046
and I need you here
to get to sleep.

03:42.787 --> 03:43.918
- I'm a grown man, Jay.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.358
- What does that have to
do with me needing you?

03:48.402 --> 03:52.971
You know if you'd trust me
more, we'd both feel better.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.976
- Darrell, you didn't
even get in the bed.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.283
How could you not
get in the bed?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.285
- I went to sleep on
the couch last night.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.026
You know you get when
you get restless in bed

04:04.069 --> 04:06.028
and I ain't trying
to get my ass kicked.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.683
- Darrell, they are coming at me

04:08.726 --> 04:10.337
from every angle.

04:10.380 --> 04:15.124
When I'm awake, it's
Ruth, it's mom, it's you.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.779
When I'm asleep, it's Beth.

04:17.822 --> 04:18.867
- But I'm right here.

04:20.346 --> 04:21.173
- Sometimes.

04:28.877 --> 04:29.443
- Okay.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.273
So how about this?

04:33.316 --> 04:35.318
No curfew, but I promise

04:35.362 --> 04:37.102
to brave the field of battle

04:37.146 --> 04:40.236
and hop in the bed no
matter how jacked up it is.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.936
- Darrell, when
I'm going through

04:44.980 --> 04:46.242
the thick of it,

04:46.286 --> 04:49.376
can you just at least
please come home early.

04:49.419 --> 04:53.293
Look, I don't need you to be
home at 6 p.m. for dinner,

04:53.336 --> 04:56.165
but at least, come on,
just give me something.

04:56.207 --> 04:58.472
Give me some touch by 10.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.996
I'm not asking all the time.

05:01.039 --> 05:04.260
Just when things are thick.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.307
- But that's the thing.

05:07.350 --> 05:10.092
Things are always thick for you.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.182
Even when there's
no real problem,

05:13.225 --> 05:14.488
you find something
to worry about.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.146
Look, remember that time

05:21.190 --> 05:23.366
you were convinced I
was trying to kill you?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.281
- Oh.
- Because-

05:25.325 --> 05:27.065
- Oh, yeah, yeah, whatever,
that was a tough month then.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.158
Couch, huh?

05:34.116 --> 05:35.204
- Come on.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.515
[Jay sighs]

05:41.558 --> 05:46.563
Yeah.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.089
Innocent until
proven guilty, right?

05:52.439 --> 05:54.049
- I am sorry.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.832
I didn't mean to treat you like-

05:55.877 --> 05:56.443
- A liar.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.402
But you did, yeah.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.452
[phone buzzes]

06:08.411 --> 06:13.373
- It's just, my
head is just cloudy

06:14.939 --> 06:16.245
and all the nightmares
are starting

06:16.288 --> 06:19.074
to feel more and more
real and like I can't,

06:19.117 --> 06:20.902
I can't figure out-

06:20.945 --> 06:22.164
- What the fuck is this?

06:25.428 --> 06:26.951
- It's protection.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.955
I, maybe I've been
freaking out because

06:30.999 --> 06:32.261
of these nightmares

06:32.304 --> 06:34.132
and I just got that
totally in case.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.917
- Yeah, but what
has that got to to

06:35.960 --> 06:36.657
with you hiding a
knife in the couch?

06:38.267 --> 06:40.008
I mean, if you need
protection, you can come to me.

06:40.051 --> 06:43.011
- Darrell, you're not
even here at night.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.534
I don't know if
somebody's gonna come

06:44.578 --> 06:46.362
through that back door
or through the front door

06:46.406 --> 06:48.146
or through the window.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.887
- Have you been
taking your pills?

06:49.931 --> 06:51.062
- Yes.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.150
- As prescribed?

06:52.194 --> 06:53.413
- Yes.
- Without liquor.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.203
[Darrell scoffs]

07:01.246 --> 07:03.988
You dancing with the devil
all by yourself in your head.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.687
- I hate when you call me crazy.

07:08.036 --> 07:08.558
- I didn't call you crazy.

07:08.602 --> 07:09.603
- In my head?

07:11.692 --> 07:14.129
- All right, I'm sorry, Jay.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.652
I didn't mean it.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.306
It's just, I just
wanna make sure

07:17.349 --> 07:19.221
you taking care of yourself.

07:19.264 --> 07:22.006
[Jay exhales]

07:23.225 --> 07:24.182
- Who keeps calling you?

07:25.314 --> 07:26.141
- It's work.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.099
- Let me see the phone.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.101
- Damn.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.581
Why can't you just
trust a nigga?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.104
- Because sometimes a
nigga can't be trusted.

07:35.063 --> 07:35.629
- You trippin'.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.068
Take this, put this for before
one of us kill ourselves.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.244
[phone buzzes]

07:42.287 --> 07:43.245
Yo.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.115
What's good?

07:46.204 --> 07:47.205
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.177
[door closes]

08:02.220 --> 08:04.092
[Jay sighs]

08:04.135 --> 08:06.224
- Lyin' ass motherfucker.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.226
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Judge.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.576
- See you later.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.273
- Morning, Judge.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.579
- Morning, Barbara.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.015
I assume you have
a plan for today.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.320
- Indeed I do.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.280
Ali is all anybody
can talk about.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.455
- [Jay] Hmm.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.110
- The Arabs painting Black folk

08:22.153 --> 08:24.155
as perpetual criminals.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.461
- Then there's
Reverend Opportunity

08:25.505 --> 08:27.463
in his ugly ass suits.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.160
You would think a guy
ripping off his flock

08:29.204 --> 08:30.205
would dress much better.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.076
- Right?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.338
Anywho, when I saw both
groups up in that hallway,

08:34.383 --> 08:37.299
I went in there with
a couple of officers,

08:37.342 --> 08:39.082
put then in neutral corners.

08:39.126 --> 08:40.389
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.086
- I'm not having another
bloody Monday in here.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.087
Plus we got press coming.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.786
We need some press.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.050
Who's doing traffic court today?

08:49.093 --> 08:51.052
- Judge Graves.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.488
- Damn, that means
Spangler's doing housing.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.098
Okay, this is what I need.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.578
I need Spangler to take traffic

08:55.622 --> 08:57.362
in Graves' courtroom and Graves

08:57.406 --> 08:59.451
to take the housing
docket in your courtroom.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.716
- You know neither one of
them is going to like that.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.326
- If they bark-
- I know.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.197
- Send them straight to you.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.503
- Why the switch?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.070
- You know how thick
traffic court is.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.115
Spangler's so much faster.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.726
Hey, with all Talid bracket,

09:12.769 --> 09:14.771
have you had time to get ready
for Graves' dinner tonight?

09:14.815 --> 09:16.338
- Yeah, I'll be ready.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.253
I just gotta put
this to bed first.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.211
- Every time things settle
down, something new happens.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.257
- Yeah, tell me about it.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.563
The Talids swear the Smiths
are pulling a Jessie.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.434
- A Jessie?

09:25.477 --> 09:27.262
- Yeah, you know.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.524
The notes that the Smiths
found in front of their house?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.091
Well, the Talids are saying

09:30.134 --> 09:31.048
that the Smiths put
it there themselves

09:31.092 --> 09:32.484
and are blaming them.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.311
- Oh, dear Lord.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.096
Okay.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.272
Well, Judge, this is
where I drop you off.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.230
Have a great day and I
will see you tonight.

09:39.274 --> 09:39.840
- Yeah.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.504
Hey, Jean, did you print out all

09:52.548 --> 09:55.159
that Steele stuff
that I asked for?

09:55.203 --> 09:56.421
- Yes, I did.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.598
It's on your desk, I-
- Oh, here it is.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.688
- Judge, why don't you
let me just clean off-

10:01.731 --> 10:04.734
- No, no, because if
you move anything,

10:04.778 --> 10:05.909
it'll confuse me.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.869
- But you can't find
anything right now.

10:08.912 --> 10:11.349
- Why don't you just let
me run things my way.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.527
- Okay.

10:17.225 --> 10:17.791
- Jean.

10:20.794 --> 10:21.621
I'm sorry.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.685
[keys click]

10:42.729 --> 10:44.208
- So, how did she
become a judge?

10:44.252 --> 10:47.516
Well, if you guys seen
her face, she's hot.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.214
But hot doesn't mean competent.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.694
And you want a competent judge

10:51.738 --> 10:53.609
to handle a criminal
case, you know.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.046
So, women voted for her
because she's one of them

10:56.090 --> 10:58.222
and Black people
voted for her because

10:58.266 --> 10:59.789
she's also one of them.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.225
You know, she's already
killed one woman already

11:01.269 --> 11:03.314
and now one of the
most explosive cases

11:03.358 --> 11:05.186
that's rocked this
entire community has

11:05.229 --> 11:06.404
been placed on her doorstep.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.884
That's not a good thing

11:07.928 --> 11:09.669
and I don't see
this playing well.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.643
- Good morning, Judge.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.123
- [Judge 2] Barbara.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.821
- Your 9 a.m. docket
is set and ready to go.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.128
- And how are you
this morning, Barbara?

11:34.171 --> 11:36.086
Rumor's still flying I see?

11:36.130 --> 11:38.045
- Well, she did burn
down your house.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.220
- [Judge 2] It was
three weeks ago.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.743
- Still interesting.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.658
You're lucky, though.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.312
This Ali thing has pushed
you out of the news cycle.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.401
- Yeah, but everyone here-

11:47.576 --> 11:49.056
- Can you blame them?

11:49.099 --> 11:50.187
She's still calling.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.538
- Indeed she is.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.714
Have a good day.

11:54.757 --> 11:55.976
Everybody.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.200
[all laughing]

12:08.292 --> 12:10.642
- Howard what are you doing
in Spangler's chambers?

12:10.686 --> 12:12.993
- Barbara's working
some logistic magic

12:13.036 --> 12:16.518
and she put Ruth in
my room to do traffic

12:16.561 --> 12:18.694
and I'm doing housing.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.350
It appears that I
don't move as quickly

12:22.393 --> 12:24.439
as she wants me to.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.267
- Docket over already?

12:26.310 --> 12:29.705
- No, I have them working
on some plea deals.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.751
I've got about
another hour to go.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.363
So, what's new with you?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.582
- Nothing.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.062
- You sure?

12:39.106 --> 12:40.585
- I am.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.763
- Have you contained
your situation?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.286
- Working on it.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.722
- According to the
clerk's office,

12:46.766 --> 12:47.854
you need to work harder.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.812
- They live for that nonsense.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.248
- You haven't changed

12:51.292 --> 12:52.075
your mind about pressing
charges, have you?

12:52.119 --> 12:53.642
- Oh, hell, no.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.209
Last thing I want is a
criminal case opening up

12:55.252 --> 12:56.688
the doors to my love life.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.429
Besides.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.517
- You're not done
with her, are you?

12:59.561 --> 13:01.302
[Judge chuckles]

13:01.345 --> 13:03.304
You like that crazy shit.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.261
- Hey, shh.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.178
I like women who do
unexpected things.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.659
- Leave Jay alone.

13:10.702 --> 13:11.660
- I never said-

13:11.703 --> 13:12.661
- You don't have to.

13:12.704 --> 13:13.488
I got eyes on you.

13:14.881 --> 13:15.882
Ruth, Ruth.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.147
- How's my housing docket
going there, Howard?

13:20.190 --> 13:21.975
- Business as usual.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.541
Everybody's outraged
at the city danes

13:23.585 --> 13:26.066
to make them keep
their houses up.

13:26.109 --> 13:29.112
And how are my traffic
court citizens?

13:29.156 --> 13:31.071
- Indignant as always.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.768
Some days I like
the suspects better

13:32.812 --> 13:33.943
than the citizens.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.771
Traffic court is the worst.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.294
- No argument there.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.601
- And I've gotten stuck
there twice this week.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.472
- You got a complaint, make it.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.996
- I'm not complaining.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.780
We all hate traffic court.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.262
Just saying, I got
stuck twice this week.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.090
- Because I'm too slow.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.656
That's where you wanna
end that sentence, right?

13:51.700 --> 13:52.832
- Okay, children,
let's to argue.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.268
Things are what they are.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.269
We're making this thing work

13:55.312 --> 13:56.400
the best way we can.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.099
Thank you.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.147
I wish you wouldn't
work her up like that.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.888
- You were standing right here.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.672
She started it.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.457
- Howard.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.807
- Y'all too damn serious,
that's your problem.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.463

years and I'm outta here.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.707

15:29.058 --> 15:30.451
- This is not the judge we had.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.453
I want the judge we had.

Who you get after that

can I help you?

15:45.466 --> 15:46.858
- No, Your Honor.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.295
- What do mean no?

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
She asked you if there's
something, tell her.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.343
- Ali, I'm telling
you this won't work.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.521
I apologize, Your Honor.

15:57.565 --> 16:01.525
My client here is
concerned that, well-

16:03.005 --> 16:04.528
- I'll be biased
'cause I'm black.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.444
- My apologies, Your Honor.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.272
- No need to apologize.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.057
It's human nature to
treat your own better

16:11.100 --> 16:12.710
than you would treat others

16:12.754 --> 16:15.757
and, obviously, anyone
in Mr. Talid's position

16:15.800 --> 16:17.541
would think that.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.152
He's just bold enough to say it.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.633
- So, you admit
you're prejudice.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.635
- Well, that's the
thing, Mr. Talid.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.811
We all are.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.248
But no one wants to admit it.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.466
But if you don't admit it,

16:29.510 --> 16:31.164
then you adjust for it.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.861
- So, we'll get the other judge.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.254
- No, no.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.429
- Don't worry.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.996
I double check all of my actions

they can't let me be.

stop coming over.

a cosmetic complaint.

about this technology here.

imply, I just thought.

this, kindergarten?

22:08.283 --> 22:09.066
- I have a project, yes.

22:09.110 --> 22:09.937
- Ooh.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.983
How's it going in there?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.943
- As smooth as can be
expected, I suppose,

22:15.986 --> 22:19.120
but I'm being sent
to get envelopes.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.991
- Envelopes, why?

22:21.035 --> 22:24.299
- Judge Johnson is flying away,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.301
just left of center today.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.000
- Well, she and Graves
must be sipping out

22:30.044 --> 22:32.307
the same cup, 'cause
he's on one, too.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.135
- Really?

22:34.178 --> 22:36.137
Maybe we need to be
sipping out the cup.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.486
- Now you're talking.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.969
- Well, thank you.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.536
- I need two envelopes.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.407
Don't ask me because
I don't know.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.453
- Okay, and what
can I do for you?

22:47.496 --> 22:49.063
- I need to schedule
a housing docket

22:49.106 --> 22:51.065
at someone's house.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.066
- What?

22:52.109 --> 22:53.415
- It's Ms. Felix.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.591
Graves wants to direct
the repairs in person.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.159
- If it gets her
out of our hair,

22:58.202 --> 22:59.900
I will figure it out.

22:59.943 --> 23:02.032
Tell him I'll put
some orders together.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.338
- Okay, good luck with whatever

23:03.382 --> 23:05.035
you got going on over there.

23:05.079 --> 23:05.906
- Same to you.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.916
- Thank you, Jean.
- You're welcome.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.440
- Now, don't go
anywhere, please.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.185
Hand this to Prosecutor Meeks

23:24.228 --> 23:25.273
and this to Mr. Bale.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.234
Now, I've come to a verdict,

23:30.278 --> 23:31.410
which I've put in
a piece of paper

23:31.453 --> 23:33.194
and put in those envelopes,

23:33.237 --> 23:35.065
which Jean has just
handed to counsel.

23:35.109 --> 23:38.460
Uh, excuse me, Mr.
Prosecutor, do not open that

23:38.504 --> 23:39.940
until I say.

23:39.983 --> 23:40.549
Thank you.

23:42.290 --> 23:46.033
Now, I did that because
I want you to know

23:46.076 --> 23:49.166
that what I'm about to do
does not affect the verdict.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.300
- Well, I want my verdict.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.171
You can do whatever else
you want after that.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.086
- I could.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.047
But then I'll lose everybody

24:00.090 --> 24:01.570
and I don't want that.

24:01.614 --> 24:05.400
[courtroom chatters]
- Quiet!

24:10.013 --> 24:11.537
- What is this?

24:11.580 --> 24:13.626
- A courtroom,
mine, have a seat.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.630
Thank you, Mr. Talid.

24:22.591 --> 24:27.553
Now, I'm gonna ask all
of you the same question.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.431
[phone buzzes]

25:00.194 --> 25:02.457
- I'd like to talk
to Detective Edwards.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.113
- So, let me summarize
what we've just learned.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.550
In response to what you saw

25:08.594 --> 25:11.205
as a young boy's
failure to respect you

25:11.248 --> 25:13.468
while inquiring
about a cinnabun,

25:13.512 --> 25:16.036
you lobbed a rolling pin
in his direction, correct?

25:17.690 --> 25:18.691
That was a question.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.129
- Yes, but-

25:22.172 --> 25:24.087
- And, you, Jalisa,
do you let your kids

25:24.131 --> 25:25.567
come at your crooked?

25:28.352 --> 25:31.138
So, what did Jovan
call Mr. Talid?

25:33.096 --> 25:34.533
- A desert rate.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.273
- The whole thing.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.232
- A motherfucker falafel
eating desert rate.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.494
- Oh.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.365
So, a 12-year-old comes

25:41.409 --> 25:43.585
at you and calls you a fried
chicken eatin' N-I-G-G-A,

25:43.629 --> 25:45.108
what you gonna do, hmm?

25:45.152 --> 25:47.110
Not that it was right and okay

25:47.154 --> 25:49.025
for you to lob that rolling pin.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.594
But you came in there swinging

25:52.638 --> 25:54.596
and you brought who with you?

25:57.425 --> 25:59.209
- Jordan and Gerard.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.690
- Knowing full well that
Jordan is on probation.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.694
As soon as last week's
conviction makes it

26:05.738 --> 26:07.609
through the system,

26:07.653 --> 26:08.784
they gonna violate you.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.180
How long is your tail, Jordan?

26:15.312 --> 26:16.139
- It's a year.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.620
- So you about to do a year

26:18.664 --> 26:21.231
because a 12-year-old
child, your son,

26:21.275 --> 26:23.625
decided that he wanted
to call this man a name

26:23.669 --> 26:27.150
and all the adults lost
their frickin' minds.

26:27.194 --> 26:30.284
And, you, Fatima,
talkin' about some,

26:30.327 --> 26:33.156
oh, Black people can't
control themselves.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.117
Did you or did you
not smack Jalisa,

26:37.160 --> 26:40.163
even when the police were
standing right there?

26:40.207 --> 26:42.296
- I have the right
to defend myself.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.558
- The police were already there.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.690
That wasn't self-defense.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.430
That was you just being mad.

26:47.780 --> 26:48.607
Jean.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.787
Thank you, Jean.
- You're welcome.

26:56.571 --> 26:59.661
- The whole point of
this entire exercise is

26:59.705 --> 27:04.274
to make you feel as foolish
as you look, all of you.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.453
Now, for three weeks,

27:09.497 --> 27:12.805
you have been exchanging
racial epitaphs,

27:12.848 --> 27:14.545
vandalizing property
and I get it.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.897
This nonsense didn't
occur inside of a vacuum.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.682
Most everyone believes

27:20.726 --> 27:23.206
that it's inevitable that
things like this will occur

27:23.250 --> 27:25.687
when you have two
competing cultures

27:25.731 --> 27:27.080
within close proximity.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.038
But here's the thing.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.695
History is destined
to repeat itself

27:33.739 --> 27:36.916
if we do not make a
conscious decision

27:36.959 --> 27:38.744
to do better.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.310
- This doesn't fix anything.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.661
- Sit your foul ass down
before I make change.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.404
This fixes nothing
because you are committed

27:47.448 --> 27:49.189
to the proposition
of leaving here

27:49.232 --> 27:51.104
and doing the exact same thing.

27:51.147 --> 27:54.237
All of you are wrong.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.238
Don't you see that?

27:57.153 --> 27:58.807
Do you not see it, Fatima?

28:01.157 --> 28:03.812
Nod yes, 'cause I ain't
taking any other answer.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.729
Now, you can fight
amongst yourselves

28:07.773 --> 28:09.078
if you want to and feed

28:09.122 --> 28:10.776
the corrections
corporations of America,

28:10.819 --> 28:12.691
but just remember this.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.519
You are Black and you are Brown.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.738
You'll be the first to go

28:16.782 --> 28:18.435
and you stay the longest.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.962
Or, you can figure out a way

28:23.005 --> 28:25.268
to do business together.

28:25.312 --> 28:26.574
Get money.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.794
Establish generational wealth.

28:30.491 --> 28:33.320
Whatever it is, get
past your feelings

28:33.363 --> 28:35.278
and move on to what's important.

28:38.804 --> 28:39.805
You keep this up

28:41.110 --> 28:42.329
and you will go to jail.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.113
Know that.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.290
And when you do,

28:52.165 --> 28:53.557
I want you to envision this.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.386
What's this Jordan?

28:57.736 --> 28:58.954
- It's a cinnamon roll.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.828
- Jalisa, your son
wanted to buy one.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.744
You wanted to sell it to him.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.485
But because, oh, somebody
called somebody a name,

29:08.529 --> 29:11.010
you got seven people now
with criminal records,

29:11.053 --> 29:12.968
spent thousands now
on attorney fees

29:14.143 --> 29:15.666
and Jordan might
be doing a year.

29:16.929 --> 29:17.756
For this.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.065
So,

29:26.068 --> 29:26.982
I find you guilty.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.029
$250 fine.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.075
30 days suspended.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.208
Same probation conditions
as everybody else.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.299
Which, if you ask me
is coupe de grace.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.519
Anybody read their
probation conditions?

29:49.091 --> 29:51.441
- We have to come
here every week?

29:51.485 --> 29:53.356
- See, now you can
all come together

29:53.400 --> 29:54.314
and hate me.

29:55.881 --> 29:56.838
Just know this.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.710
I am going to keep it up

29:59.754 --> 30:02.017
until I am satisfied
that you all

30:02.061 --> 30:03.627
are no longer keeping it up.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.068
- What just happened.

30:09.111 --> 30:12.506
- Ooh [coughs].

30:12.549 --> 30:13.420
Shit.

30:15.901 --> 30:16.815
Goddamn.

30:19.426 --> 30:20.862
- nigga, I smell
your stinkin' ass

30:20.906 --> 30:22.951
all the way in the room.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.779
- You ate the same
sandwich as me.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.302
Give it 20 minutes.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.129
You gonna take the
same shit, watch.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.522
- Hey, Michael.

30:30.741 --> 30:31.917
I know you hear me, man.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.883
Look, man, I appreciate
the sandwich and all,

30:41.927 --> 30:44.494
but you really gotta get
the fuck up outta here.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.629
- You sound parched.

30:48.672 --> 30:49.891
You need a drink.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.023
Don't worry about it.

30:51.066 --> 30:51.850
I know where the cups are.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.335
- Come on.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.467
- Okay, okay.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.340
[glasses clink]

31:06.647 --> 31:07.474
Cheers.

31:08.823 --> 31:09.868
No cheers.

31:09.911 --> 31:10.738
Okay, mm.

31:14.350 --> 31:16.004
- So how often do you do this?

31:16.048 --> 31:18.877
I mean, you in here
like this your spot.

31:18.920 --> 31:19.747
- All the time.

31:21.488 --> 31:22.532
Well, I mean, nigga, you
know where I live, bruh.

31:22.576 --> 31:23.446
Can you blame me?

31:24.926 --> 31:26.797
- Richard to be trippin'
like a motherfucker.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.103
- Man, it's not even him.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.322
I mean, don't get me wrong like,

31:29.365 --> 31:30.801
he be going on his little trips,

31:30.845 --> 31:32.325

start runnin' around,

31:32.368 --> 31:34.109
blowin' smoke for
about an hour or two,

31:34.153 --> 31:38.722
but shit, one time, look,
don't tell Mom, all right, but-

31:40.637 --> 31:43.075
- nigga, you 28, talkin'
about don't tell Mom.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.511
- As I was sayin', aight,

31:45.991 --> 31:47.949
you know that situation
that got you locked up?

31:47.993 --> 31:49.951
Yeah, yeah, that one.

31:51.387 --> 31:52.911
Ever since then, I've had

31:52.954 --> 31:54.869
to keep me a little
stash of Johnny Black

31:54.913 --> 31:57.002
on the low for him, you
know what I'm sayin'?

31:57.045 --> 31:58.699
Give him a little sip of that,

31:58.742 --> 32:00.005
shit, he drink his self quiet.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.312
- Don't he got a bad liver?

32:03.356 --> 32:05.924
- Mm, yeah, that's why
I said don't tell Mom.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.882
- nigga, that's your pops.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.798
- Okay, and, do not try
to romanticize fatherhood

32:10.841 --> 32:13.018
just 'cause you ain't
got no daddy, aight.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.543
- So, let me get this straight.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.328
You over there
poisoning your father

32:19.372 --> 32:21.548
to keep hi quiet,
then why are you here?

32:22.462 --> 32:23.680
- Look, it's not him.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.204
It's the women.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.554
Aight, I got Mom
in one ear barking

32:27.597 --> 32:29.338
about me having this
bitch up in the house

32:29.382 --> 32:31.253
and why I ain't got
no fuckin' 9 to 5.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.125
Then I got Tenisha
in this year barking

32:33.168 --> 32:35.257
about the shut that
bitch the fuck up

32:35.301 --> 32:36.519
and why we need money.

32:36.563 --> 32:39.783
A nigga just wanna, hoo.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.090
- Damn.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.224
That's crazy.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.749
So, a guy over there
completely out of his mind,

32:48.792 --> 32:50.446
and he easier to talk
to than the women.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.274
- Right.

32:52.318 --> 32:55.103
- Look, man, I feel you and
all, but this right here

32:55.147 --> 32:55.974
ain't gonna fly.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.108
- You sure about that?

33:00.152 --> 33:01.022
- nigga, what you mean?

33:02.632 --> 33:04.243
[glass clinks]

33:04.286 --> 33:05.853
You know your homie,
Tamar, like to gossip

33:05.896 --> 33:07.028
like a little bitch, right?

33:08.247 --> 33:09.639
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:09.683 --> 33:10.858
You know your little sweet thing

33:10.901 --> 33:12.860
at the High Bar, mm-hmm.

33:12.903 --> 33:13.904
I know all about it.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.733
Oh, and what's the other one,

33:16.777 --> 33:19.258
the little redhead chick,
what's her name, Gina?

33:19.301 --> 33:21.173
Gina or some shit, Gina
with the big titties.

33:21.216 --> 33:24.045
Whoo, boy, you are
crazy for that one.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.916
I ain't gonna lie.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.048
I was hatin' on you for
a little bit on that one.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.484
I was hatin' just a little bit.

33:28.528 --> 33:29.485
But listen, bruh.

33:30.921 --> 33:33.141

be runnin' around doing

sister not feel nothin',

33:36.101 --> 33:38.233
you trippin', okay?

33:39.321 --> 33:42.063
All I gotta do is, you know,

33:42.107 --> 33:43.586
bring up a little fact

33:43.630 --> 33:45.153
that, you know, you
be over here showering

33:45.197 --> 33:47.155
throughout the
days gettin' fresh,

33:48.591 --> 33:50.202

incident in there.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.161
Shit, your life's starting

33:53.205 --> 33:54.902

up like mine, ain't it?

33:54.945 --> 33:56.425
[Michael laughs]

33:56.469 --> 33:57.513
- Well, you just
about bitch enough

33:57.557 --> 33:58.514
to do it, ain't you?

33:58.558 --> 34:00.908
- Ah, bitch or clever.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.086
Look, how about this.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.828
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

34:07.871 --> 34:09.656
Anytime I wanna come
over here and hang out,

34:09.699 --> 34:11.092
I'll give you a ring.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.138
Make sure you not
over here washing off

34:13.181 --> 34:15.792
any evidence or anything
like that, okay, how's that.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.101
Hey, man, lighten up.

Don't be so uptight, okay?

key you took from me,

peace for both of us.

tacos in the fridge?

to get back to them.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.688
- So, what I realized
in that moment is

34:42.732 --> 34:44.734
that yes, Graves is right.

34:44.777 --> 34:47.955
Everything can be
solved with a candy bar.

34:53.264 --> 34:55.049
And who would've known

34:56.181 --> 34:59.140
and that is classic
Howard Graves.

34:59.184 --> 35:03.144
So, what I realized is
that Graves' candy bars

35:03.188 --> 35:07.061
that he always carries
around munching on

35:07.105 --> 35:09.803
is actually a metaphor
for his kindness

35:09.846 --> 35:11.239
and his sweetness

35:11.283 --> 35:15.113
and that is classic
Howard Graves.

incorrigible [laughs]

35:29.257 --> 35:32.173

35:32.217 --> 35:34.654
Ladies, okay, so then
that tells me one

35:34.697 --> 35:36.830
of two things.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.572
Ladies, either we need to
start buying better shoes

35:39.615 --> 35:42.792
or fellows, y'all need to
step y'all game up [laughs].

35:44.751 --> 35:49.190
But in all seriousness,
Howard Graves everyone.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.237
[attendees applaud]

35:59.331 --> 36:00.767
I love you.

36:00.810 --> 36:01.985

36:07.991 --> 36:09.645
- You in trouble now.

36:09.689 --> 36:13.040
- That was wonderful, sis.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.043
You were talking about stuff

36:16.086 --> 36:17.958
I had forgotten about years ago.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.874
And when you string out

36:20.917 --> 36:23.703
the stuff like that the way
you did, I'm impressive.

36:25.313 --> 36:28.098
- You certainly are.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.709
Let me brush your
shoulders off for you.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.667
- All right, thank you.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.931
- Oh, my God, I can't believe

36:34.975 --> 36:36.846
that they're back together.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.196
She burned down his house.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.111

36:42.722 --> 36:45.028
That may be the smartest
thing she ever did.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.291
- Well done, Jay.
- Thank you.

36:46.334 --> 36:49.163
- Very, very well done.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.341
Our girl did a great
job tonight, didn't she?

36:53.385 --> 36:56.736
- Well, first off, she's
not a girl, she's a queen.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.216
- That's just an expression.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.741
Like, you know, better than sex,

37:01.784 --> 37:03.308
that was also an expression

37:03.351 --> 37:08.226
and I'm sure not a
commentary on your abilities.

37:12.404 --> 37:14.275
- If y'all don't
put your dicks away.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.018
- You should listen to your man.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.239
He's giving you
some good advice.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.155
- It's just, it's just a joke.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.200
- Well, it wasn't funny.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.288
- At all.

37:27.332 --> 37:30.291
- My apologies, ladies.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.945
Shall we get to work and mingle.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.252
We have some votes to secure.

37:38.821 --> 37:41.302

37:41.346 --> 37:44.827
- Oh, I know what
you're trying to do.

37:44.871 --> 37:48.091
And there's no way in
hell she's joining us.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.267
- Well, certainly not.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.398
She's not the type to do that.

37:52.226 --> 37:53.227
- Unlike me?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.012
- [laughs] Well.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.278
- You don't really think
she's gonna want you

38:01.453 --> 38:02.976
when she has that.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.067
- You know what I can
get a woman to do.

just gonna sit back

38:10.853 --> 38:13.160

38:13.203 --> 38:15.162

38:15.205 --> 38:18.296
- Hypothetically
speaking, what the fuck

38:18.339 --> 38:20.515
could you do about it if I did?

38:23.257 --> 38:25.215
- You of all people should know

38:25.259 --> 38:27.043
what I'm capable of.

38:31.091 --> 38:33.136
- Denise, I do believe you and I

38:33.180 --> 38:37.140
are in for some
interesting times.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.891

You were amazing.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.461
- It felt good.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.507
- And all that worrying you did.

- For nothing, right?

38:57.291 --> 38:58.423
No.

38:59.511 --> 39:02.122
It makes all the sense
in the world now,

39:02.165 --> 39:03.515

the middle of it.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.456
- Did I say that out loud?

39:33.240 --> 39:34.415

39:34.459 --> 39:35.416

thinking something

39:35.460 --> 39:37.200
