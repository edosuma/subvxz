WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.240
This programme contains
some strong language

00:04.240 --> 00:08.480
We think Dardis is alone. The house
is abandoned. I'll lead my team in
for a hard knock through the window.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.760
We've arrested Dardis.
Show me your hands now!

00:10.760 --> 00:12.400
He's not a murderer.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.440
Is he?

00:16.520 --> 00:19.400
Did your husband ever mention
Goliath? He was an assassin.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.800
Are you sure you've never
heard of it before?

00:21.800 --> 00:24.480
What do you make of this?
A sort code of some kind?

00:24.480 --> 00:29.120
If you turn the numbers around,
you get the 21st of February, 1998.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.200
This could point
to the Goliath case.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.560
As far as we're concerned,
Pat Keenan was Goliath.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.640
Pat Keenan is dead,
so Goliath is dead.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.840
The M24 rifle. A trained sniper
will aim at the chest from distance.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.720
Dardis fits the bill.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.440
And seeing as how you made this
mess, it's up to you to sort it out!

00:52.440 --> 00:54.680
This is a targeted attack, Rob.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.640
There's at least a dozen pairs
of eyes on what you do next.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.920
I like spending time with you. I do,
too. That's... That's pretty great.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.440
I know where the gold is.
I helped Colin move it.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.800
And then you killed him.
The man lost his nerve.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.920
But you don't know
where the gold is.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.040
I am very good at keeping secrets.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.040
Are we ready?

01:47.320 --> 01:50.040
The time by the interview room clock
is 6:15pm.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.680
This interview is taking place at
PSNI Dunfolan in an interview room.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.160
Also present are... DCI Brannick.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.800
For the recording, can you
state your full name, please?

01:58.800 --> 02:00.440
Olivia Foyle.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.080
AJ Boyd, solicitor.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.200
Mrs Foyle, I would like to remind
you, you are not under arrest

02:05.200 --> 02:07.680
and you are free to leave
the station at any time.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.480
You have the right to legal advice

02:09.480 --> 02:12.160
and your solicitor, Mr Boyd,
is here for that purpose.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.480
You are here in connection with the
murder of your husband, Colin Foyle,

02:15.480 --> 02:17.320
and, as explained to your solicitor,

02:17.320 --> 02:19.720
we would like to speak
to you about your movements.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.840
Do you understand? I do.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.720
I want to begin by saying that
you've brought my client here,

02:25.720 --> 02:27.880
on the day before
her husband's funeral,

02:27.880 --> 02:32.240
in a clear attempt to catch her
in a state of emotional distress.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.880
She wouldn't be here
unless we had reason.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.560
It's OK. Please, ask the questions.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.480
Mrs Foyle, approximately 48 hours
after the murder of your husband,

02:40.480 --> 02:43.280
you were pictured entering
this storage facility.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.960
Yes. It's a wee bit strange,
don't you think?

02:46.960 --> 02:49.200
You find out your husband
has been murdered

02:49.200 --> 02:50.800
and this is the first place
you go to.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.520
I had my reasons.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.000
Storage unit 174 at the time
contained two large rifle cases,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.800
one sheet of hessian sacking
and one M24 sniper rifle.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.320
The same as the rifle
that was used to kill your husband.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.280
This is two evenings before,
when your husband was killed.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.800
We believe this man
to be Robert Dardis.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.640
The tracksuit, jacket and cap

03:14.640 --> 03:16.880
match those we know
were in his possession.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.080
And we think this is
the other M24 sniper rifle.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.600
May I ask how you came
by this information?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.040
No.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.400
Right, well...

03:27.360 --> 03:30.600
..what you are neglecting to say
is that there are three units

03:30.600 --> 03:33.000
in that facility,
all rented by Colin Foyle.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.240
Units 174, 175 and 176.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.520
Yes, we're aware of that.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.680
I knew about two of those units.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.160
We used them to store stuff
while we were moving homes,

03:45.160 --> 03:46.520
but Colin did the paperwork.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.240
I mean, how could I possibly
have known about this?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.880
What were you doing there, then?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.960
I keep my jewellery there and...

03:57.960 --> 04:01.400
..just after Colin was killed
I was reminded of a ring

04:01.400 --> 04:04.320
that he'd got me just shortly
after getting together

04:04.320 --> 04:06.440
and I went to retrieve it.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.480
Hm. You dismissed your family
liaison officer the day before.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.600
Do you not think
that looks suspicious?

04:13.600 --> 04:15.720
I wasn't thinking
about how it looked.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.760
Do you have footage
of my client entering unit 174?

04:24.320 --> 04:28.640
The facility only has cameras
at the main entrances and exits
and on the perimeter walls.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.240
Do you have footage
of my client entering

04:31.240 --> 04:35.240
or leaving the building with
the aforementioned rifle cases?

04:36.480 --> 04:37.880
No.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.720
Then I think we're done here.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.600
Have you any idea why your husband
would keep these sniper rifles?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.120
Honestly...

04:45.120 --> 04:46.640
..no, I don't.

04:48.720 --> 04:53.120
I was only married to him
for 18 months and...

04:53.120 --> 04:55.480
..now, unfortunately,

04:55.480 --> 04:58.880
it seems that I didn't know
all there was to know.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.680
Is it true Rob Dardis
killed my husband?

05:09.680 --> 05:13.840
With a weapon your husband knew
about, it seems. Will that be all?

05:13.840 --> 05:16.160
Actually, there's one more thing
you could help us with.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.960
Er, no, I... No, no, sh.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.280
Please, go ahead.
Ask your questions.

05:23.120 --> 05:27.120
Robert Dardis rented a car,
a black BMW, from his employers.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.880
They had fitted GPS vehicle
trackers in all their fleet.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.960
We believe Dardis disabled his.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.400
But a fuel card he used
on the job flagged him

05:34.400 --> 05:37.000
at several locations close
to clients of your husband.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.680
We were led to believe
he only drove you.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.240
Could you tell us
who was making these journeys?

05:44.480 --> 05:46.440
Colin. My husband.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.800
He was driven by Dardis?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.880
Yes, that's right.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.400
So he didn't drive only you?

05:54.400 --> 05:55.920
No, not all the time.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.000
Why didn't you tell us that before?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.160
Well, you never asked me.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.920
Your husband knew how to drive.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.800
What was he doing
riding with Dardis?

06:08.600 --> 06:12.880
A few months ago, Colin asked Rob
to take him on certain trips.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.880
How come?

06:16.840 --> 06:21.600
Well, I assumed it was
so that he could appear important.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.120
You know, a man with a driver.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.320
Thank you.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.040
Any news from Niamh? Found a
footprint, sir, by the safe house.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.920
It might be of interest.
You were good in there.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.240
Thanks, sir. Not that we're ever
going to make anything stick.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.720
Not with a lawyer like that.
Justice is a rich man's game.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.640
Or woman's.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.040
I'll see you in the morning.
Stay out of trouble.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.520
I'll try, sir.

07:17.880 --> 07:25.280
BELL TOLLS

07:56.520 --> 08:00.200
Because God has chosen
to call our brother, Colin,

08:00.200 --> 08:02.560
from this life to himself,

08:02.560 --> 08:06.120
we commit his body to the earth.

08:06.120 --> 08:11.600
For we are dust
and unto dust we shall return.

08:11.600 --> 08:16.040
But the Lord Jesus Christ
will change our mortal bodies

08:16.040 --> 08:21.440
to be like his in glory,
for he is risen from the dead.

08:45.280 --> 08:49.840
ALARM RINGS

08:53.920 --> 08:55.280
Shit!

08:57.640 --> 08:59.760
Where are you supposed to be?
At Strangford.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.120
The boss is going to kill me. I mean
your da. Your da's going to kill me.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.760
Want me to have a word? No.
No, no, no, no. Absolutely not.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.560
So does that mean this isn't...

09:10.560 --> 09:12.320
..going to happen again?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.560
Are you mad?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.120
Are you OK?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.560
I'm grand.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.360
You're a buck eejit, Birdy.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.800
Mm. Go. Get ready. Yeah, yeah. Ow!

09:37.560 --> 09:40.640
If your life is measured by
the people who attend your funeral,

09:40.640 --> 09:43.560
Colin Foyle must be
pretty fucked off.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.160
Huh! Good performance from her.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.760
Maybe.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.520
Still no sign of Dardis? No.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.920
She knew about those rifles.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.040
That was a hell of
an interrogation yesterday.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.960
I have a job to do.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.920
Oh, if only you'd always
come on that strong, Tom.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.560
Your, erm...

10:41.800 --> 10:44.480
..junior officer, he's a sweet boy.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.560
What about him?

10:47.560 --> 10:50.280
The questions he was asking
about Dardis driving Colin,

10:50.280 --> 10:51.960
it made me think.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.520
Wherever he took Colin,

10:55.520 --> 10:57.880
just a couple of days
before he was murdered,

10:57.880 --> 10:59.800
something happened at that meeting.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.640
How do you know? Well, he came back
like the wind was kicked out of him.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.280
Any suggestion as to what it was?

11:06.240 --> 11:07.520
No.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.480
But there was...

11:10.480 --> 11:13.760
Well, there was tension
between Dardis and Colin.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.840
About what?
They didn't elaborate, but...

11:18.800 --> 11:21.840
..maybe whatever it was
came to a head that trip.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.760
Look, this is why
I didn't want to...

11:27.880 --> 11:29.800
..name Dardis to you.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.760
I didn't want to seem
like I was framing him.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.000
So why are you telling me this now?

11:36.240 --> 11:38.000
Cos we have a deal.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.720
And even if we don't...

11:42.720 --> 11:47.000
..the foundation and secret of
a good relationship, Tom, is trust.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.600
Hm.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.840
My address.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.000
In case you think of anything else.

12:04.880 --> 12:05.920
Thank you.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.320
DCI Tom Brannick.
Stephen Foyle. Louise.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.880
Your mother?

12:36.880 --> 12:38.720
That's right.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.840
I'm sorry.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.520
To lose both parents
within a couple of years.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.800
Aye, it's tough.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.600
Olivia telling you all about us,
was she?

12:48.600 --> 12:51.240
You don't think too kindly of her?

12:51.240 --> 12:53.040
What?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.720
Did I say something wrong?
Oh, not at all.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.920
Just that woman and her lies. Easy!

12:57.920 --> 13:00.440
You can't trust her
as far as you can kick her.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.440
And I could give her some boot.
Louise.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.200
The man's a police officer.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.200
Please, don't hold back
on my account.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.480
What did she tell you
about her life before this?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.520
In New York? Aye.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.120
Have you had the same version
more than once?

13:23.440 --> 13:26.440
She said that's where
she met your da. Did she?

13:26.440 --> 13:28.480
They met in a bar in Dublin.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.000
He was near the end of caring
for our mum.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.960
Olivia was glamorous,
offered some escape.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.320
Glamorous is one word for it.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.760
She knows her effect, that woman.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.640
She plays on it.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.440
And imagine her ego in
a small community like this.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.400
She made sure all the men knew
who she was, that's for sure.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
Bunch of retirees looking at her

13:51.400 --> 13:53.680
like the last power tool
in the shop.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.080
He did go to New York to see her,
not long after Mum died.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.120
Aye. We thought, what harm
could it do, you know? Aye.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.960
She didn't hang about.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.840
We barely had time to talk to him
before they were married.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
He proposed to her, though, eh?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.480
He said as much. 

14:10.480 --> 14:12.280
And maybe it's true.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.200
He was all about doing things
the right way.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.600
But he was not the one calling
the shots in that relationship.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.400
I had heard that something went on

14:21.400 --> 14:23.880
around her departure
from her firm in New York.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.280
We've an investigator
looking into it over there.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.160
Have they found anything?

14:29.160 --> 14:32.000
The whole thing is shrouded in NDAs.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.000
Look, I know you weren't here
when your father was murdered,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
but I have to ask you this.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.240
Were you aware
of his criminal activity?

14:49.840 --> 14:53.000
You're not going to be asked
to testify against him now.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
We were aware, aye.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.120
Did you know what he was doing? No.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.640
It's Northern Ireland.
We don't talk about what we
don't want to talk about.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.360
ANSWER MACHINE: You've reached
Chensey Cohen Associates.
Please leave a message.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.320
Good morning, this is Detective
Chief Inspector Tom Brannick

15:25.320 --> 15:27.560
from the Police Service
of Northern Ireland.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.720
I'm hoping to talk to someone
about a former employee of yours,

15:30.720 --> 15:32.680
a Miss Olivia Deegan.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.720
Erm, we're five hours ahead here,

15:34.720 --> 15:37.600
but if someone could give me
a call back I'd appreciate it.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.360
Have you got pictures
of everyone in attendance?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.840
Aye. We've cross-checked
each person with former

15:44.840 --> 15:48.000
and active paramilitary members,
organised crime affiliation,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.840
to see if anyone raises a red flag.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.200
OK.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.000
Do you think we should treat
his kids with suspicion?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.160
Neither of them was in the country.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.920
Aye, but they could have
hired someone to do it.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.000
But why now, after all this time?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.440
Nah, doesn't feel right.
I'd stick with what we know.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.920
Birdy?

16:08.920 --> 16:11.040
Sir. Where were you?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.240
Erm... I slept in. Sorry, sir. Hm.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.120
Thought you grew up on a farm.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.280
Up with the sunrise and all that.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.440
Erm, sir?

16:20.440 --> 16:23.560
I need to find out the last time
Dardis used his fuel card.

16:23.560 --> 16:27.040
How do I do that? What's your login?

16:27.040 --> 16:29.680
Well, it's against the guidelines

16:29.680 --> 16:32.120
to share login information
with another officer, sir.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.280
Of course it is. Sorry.
Can you look into it, eh?

16:36.520 --> 16:38.040
Oh, excuse me.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.160
Erm, yeah, just see
if you can find out

16:41.160 --> 16:44.680
if he refuelled close
to any of Colin's clients.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.720
Sir?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.880
What's this about a footprint?

16:50.880 --> 16:54.120
Erm, we found it at the back
of the safe house.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.320
It's a match for the one we found
beside Colin Foyle's body.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.960
Is it Dardis?

16:58.960 --> 17:01.120
Doesn't match the footwear
he had on,

17:01.120 --> 17:03.080
but it might give us an accomplice?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.760
What size?

17:04.760 --> 17:06.720
10.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.160
It'll be a man, then, most likely.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.880
Tom!

17:11.880 --> 17:13.400
Let me know.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.000
Forensics have confirmed traces
of banknotes in Colin Foyle's car.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.760
Looks like he was handling
large quantities of cash.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.520
And with the high value cash
robberies in Armagh recently,

17:25.520 --> 17:29.600
I shared our results
with detectives there
to see if there's a connection.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.600
Right. So we need to look harder
at who Colin Foyle was working for.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.560
We don't need to bash the heads
of organised crime, Tom.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.400
It's a murder investigation,
pure and simple.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.760
Sit down.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.800
Did you get lucky?

17:49.760 --> 17:52.000
Did I get... Why would you say that?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.400
You did!
Shut up. Shut up! How did you know?

17:57.640 --> 17:59.600
I'm good at my job!

18:01.360 --> 18:03.800
Any joy? Birdy got lucky, sir.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.600
No. Erm...

18:06.680 --> 18:09.400
Billy Bird.
Do we need to have a talk?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.680
Sir?

18:13.760 --> 18:14.920
Was she family?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.640
What? Well, you never know
with farmers.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.680
There's laws against
that kind of thing.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.040
Oh, aye.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.520
Erm...

18:25.520 --> 18:28.440
The last time Dardis
used his fuel card

18:28.440 --> 18:31.400
was two days before
Colin Foyle was shot.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.880
Erm...

18:32.880 --> 18:36.320
The closest client of Foyle's to
there is a Mrs Lauren Fitzpatrick.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.720
What's her line of work?
She's a jeweller, sir.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.120
I thought Foyle's clients were
all high-ranking business types?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.760
Mostly they are.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.440
I mean, we don't know that he
definitely went to see her.

18:46.440 --> 18:50.200
To make sure of that,
we'd have to have either
Foyle's or Dardis' phones.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.800
And any sign of Dardis'
other phone? Not yet.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.000
A jeweller could be a conduit
for high value items.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.440
Let's go talk to her.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.400
We've been spotted.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.680
Excuse me!

19:35.720 --> 19:38.040
Can I help you? Hello there.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.400
PSNI.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.560
Come on in.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.760
Mrs Fitzpatrick?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.320
Miss.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.240
This about the motorbikes?

19:51.240 --> 19:52.840
No. Should be.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.680
They fly up and down here
like it's the Ulster Grand Prix.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.040
No, we're here to talk
to you about Colin Foyle.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.040
That's a sad business.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.600
I've been one of his clients
since the beginning.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.040
How long is that? 35 years.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.960
Older than you.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.160
Someone shot him, is that right?
Aye.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.560
You don't seem surprised.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.640
I'm beyond that, love.
He was a good man.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.120
Good accountant.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.080
He'll be missed.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.280
Did he come to see you last week?
He did.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.160
Talked me through my books.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.960
And that was it?

20:31.960 --> 20:33.400
I reckon so.

20:35.160 --> 20:40.200
He, erm... He was driven here by
someone from Belfast Executive Cars.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.800
Can't say that I noticed that.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.440
The driver was a man
called Robert Dardis.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.800
Right.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.280
Do you know him? Dardis, you say?

20:51.280 --> 20:54.280
No. Come away from that, love,
I don't want you touching things.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.520
Did Mr Foyle ever buy any items
of value off you with cash?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.680
Or did he ever agree
to sell items you made?

21:03.680 --> 21:06.000
No. He was just my accountant.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.880
Did you ever make anything
for Mrs Foyle? Which one?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.560
The new one.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.280
Hm. No, I did not.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.080
Hm. Really?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.840
That's strange.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.600
Why do you say that?

21:21.600 --> 21:25.320
Ah, we'd heard talk that
she'd married him for money.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.760
SHE CHUCKLES

21:26.760 --> 21:29.920
God forbid the police are relying
on County Down gossip!

21:32.400 --> 21:33.840
What's this?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.480
That?

21:36.480 --> 21:38.720
Well, it's a piece of material.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.120
What are you doing?

21:40.120 --> 21:41.920
That's my property!

21:45.160 --> 21:46.880
Those red stripes.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.960
Very distinctive, eh? Mm.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.800
And this oil mark.
What do you think that is?

21:52.800 --> 21:56.240
I don't know. Whatever tool it was
wrapped in. What's this about?

21:56.240 --> 22:00.240
Two rifle cases were recovered
from a storage facility
in Dunfolan yesterday.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.920
One of them had
a sniper rifle inside it

22:02.920 --> 22:06.440
and beside it was a bit of hessian
sacking very much like this.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.560
The other rifle is missing.
I don't know anything about that.

22:11.120 --> 22:15.120
Niamh. Miss Fitzpatrick, we will be
conducting an Article 20
search of the premises,

22:15.120 --> 22:19.200
which is permitted when it is
authorised by an officer of the
rank of inspector or above.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.920
Now hold your horses...

22:20.920 --> 22:24.800
Lauren Fitzpatrick,
I am arresting you in connection
to the murder of Colin Foyle.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.120
Sir!

22:32.520 --> 22:35.680
The tool is called
a single-stage reloading press.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.720
The boxes contain primers.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.760
The cannister contains gunpowder.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.880
Your jeweller is making ammunition.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.920
What kind? Any kind she wants.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.680
She just needs the old cartridge
and then with the crucible

22:47.680 --> 22:49.840
she has the facility
to create a new bullet.

22:49.840 --> 22:53.600
Why would you do that? It's cheaper.
It means you don't need a supplier.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.880
You can use the same casings
again and again.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.080
Forensically, it can be
easier to spot,

22:58.080 --> 23:01.600
but if you're good enough you know
what the telltale signs will be.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.880
She's an old pro. Looks like it.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.760
She won't give us anything.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.560
At least we can connect Dardis
to the murder. That's not nothing.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.080
Yeah, but we don't have Dardis.
Just dead ends.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.520
Leah's going up
to the Dardis house crime scene.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.400
I said I'd go with her. Grand.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.800
Niamh?

23:30.760 --> 23:32.560
Don't beat yourself up about it.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.960
You would,
if you were the one who lost him.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.120
We shouldn't have let him go in
the first place. Remember that.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.640
Tom.
I'd like to come and talk to you.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.120
It'll be strictly
between you and me.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.560
Do we understand each other?

24:05.560 --> 24:07.480
Oh, yeah, of course. When?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.320
I'll be there in ten minutes.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.600
What, Lauren Fitzpatrick,
the jeweller?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.440
Yeah. What do you know about her?

24:17.440 --> 24:19.440
Oh, Colin wouldn't talk about her.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.120
I asked her once to do
a commission for me,

24:22.120 --> 24:24.920
and he said he didn't think
she'd be interested.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.560
I was almost jealous.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.160
Anyway, this doesn't give us
very much, does it?

24:30.160 --> 24:33.240
Because Dardis disconnected
the GPS tracker on his BMW,

24:33.240 --> 24:35.800
all we have to go on
are any ANPR cameras

24:35.800 --> 24:37.840
that would have picked him up.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.880
Erm, he didn't always drive
the BMW, you know, Dardis.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.440
What?

24:44.440 --> 24:46.960
The last couple of times
I saw him with Colin,

24:46.960 --> 24:49.600
he was in a silver car, a Mercedes.

24:59.440 --> 25:04.440
He said us staying was like a way
for her to find a way back home.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.920
Mummy.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.920
Staying in the house?

25:08.920 --> 25:11.440
No, just in the area, I think.
The country.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.600
And that upset you?

25:19.920 --> 25:22.440
Is that because you
hold on to hope...

25:23.400 --> 25:25.040
..like he does?

25:25.040 --> 25:27.760
Because you don't have
that resolution?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.920
Tell you what it is.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.120
It's like...

25:36.560 --> 25:38.200
..home itself...

25:39.440 --> 25:42.600
..has become like a weight,
you know.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.560
Like an anchor.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.920
And not in a good way.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.440
Cos, no matter how hard I try,
and I do try...

25:53.720 --> 25:55.680
..I can't get away from it.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.520
It's not like I want
to be away from Daddy.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.040
But at the same time...

26:07.080 --> 26:08.800
..my life here,

26:08.800 --> 26:10.640
you know, the place...

26:12.880 --> 26:14.840
..it's never going to let me go.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.160
It's always...

26:21.040 --> 26:23.640
It's always going to keep
pulling me back down.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.800
It's like I've no choice.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.960
So he did take out a different car?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.040
A silver Mercedes?

26:36.240 --> 26:38.600
Can I take the registration number,
please?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.280
Mm-hm.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.440
OK. Thank you.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.080
You managed to get away.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.040
Yeah, I've got time for lunch.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.400
Thanks for meeting me here.
No bother.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.200
Just wanted you to see it.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.480
To know.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.760
What are you thinking?

29:02.120 --> 29:04.040
I think you're brave...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
..talking to someone, like.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.040
You do? Aye.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.200
If my daddy were
to find out about us,

29:14.200 --> 29:17.160
could you not tell him
about this place?

29:17.160 --> 29:18.280
Course.

29:18.280 --> 29:22.160
I just don't think he'd understand
me needing to speak
to somebody else.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.600
We've no plans for him to find out
about us now, though, right?

29:31.960 --> 29:36.000
Well, when would be
a good time, Birdy?
No, that's not what I'm saying...

29:36.000 --> 29:38.640
Is it easier for you to get out if
my daddy doesn't know? Is that it?

29:38.640 --> 29:40.400
No, I'm not going to...

29:40.400 --> 29:42.760
I don't want to get out. I...

30:23.480 --> 30:26.120
The silver Mercedes
is on an ANPR camera

30:26.120 --> 30:28.360
turning into Royal Down Yacht Club.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.160
I also checked with
the executive car service.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.880
The vehicle was booked by Dardis.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.520
Did Colin own a boat? No.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.440
What about his clients?
Oh, I'm sure one of them does.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.600
Excuse me?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.120
Hi. Sorry, are you
the club chairman?

31:23.120 --> 31:25.320
Erm, no, no, I'm not,
I'm the secretary.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.920
Oh, well, you look like you
should be the club chairman.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.960
Can I help you with anything?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.280
Erm, yes. Erm, well...

31:32.280 --> 31:36.640
Like a total eejit I'm here because
I don't know where else to go

31:36.640 --> 31:38.320
and I want to buy a yacht.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.040
People do sell their yachts here.
Do they?

31:41.040 --> 31:42.480
Oh, great!

31:42.480 --> 31:45.600
I thought you were going to send me
off to a yacht shop or something.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.400
Oh, God, how stupid do I sound?!
You don't sound stupid.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.160
You are sweet. What kind
of yacht are you looking for?

31:51.160 --> 31:53.360
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.920
Tony. Tony, lovely to meet you.

31:55.920 --> 32:00.800
Erm, well, I'm hoping to surprise
my boyfriend, you see.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.200
OK. Mm.

32:02.200 --> 32:06.080
And like a proper novice,
I'm thinking style over substance.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.880
Nothing wrong with that.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.400
Oh, Tony, you're officially
my new best friend!

32:11.360 --> 32:14.360
I suppose, if I knew what types
of boats you had here,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.280
maybe I could look them up,

32:16.280 --> 32:19.880
or even if I could contact
the owners directly?

32:19.880 --> 32:21.320
You could do that, right enough.

32:21.320 --> 32:22.760
Oh, Tony.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.600
Tony, Tony, Tony!

32:24.600 --> 32:27.240
Oh, no, no, I couldn't...
No, you must.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.480
Call it a finder's fee.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.200
We're in this together now.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.920
You get a better view
from over there.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.160
Our camera's position in the eves?

32:37.160 --> 32:41.080
Aye. Whoever threw the petrol bomb
did it from around here.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.680
Multiple routes of escape.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.520
Either way down the alley.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.800
Through any of these gardens.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.960
Through those bushes, at a push.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.200
Still nothing from
the surrounding houses?

32:58.320 --> 33:01.320
No-one saw the petrol bomb
being lit, no? No.

33:01.320 --> 33:04.800
And no-one else has cameras?
Not that we're aware of.

33:07.120 --> 33:11.600
Let's say the intention of
the attacker was to hit the shed.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.880
Nice and combustible.
Sends out a clear warning.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.280
Why throw it from all
the way over there?

33:17.280 --> 33:18.880
You might miss.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.360
Unless you knew
where the camera was.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.560
A list of everyone
who owns a boat here.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.240
I'm impressed.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.520
I have my ways.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.080
Birdy, it's me.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.080
Can you look again at the
concealed camera footage we have

33:58.080 --> 34:01.080
from the Dardis house
the night it was petrol bombed?

34:01.080 --> 34:04.320
We need to make absolutely sure
there's nothing we've missed.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.600
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS

34:27.880 --> 34:29.680
You just got a message.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.120
I'll check it later.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.520
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.160
I swear.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.880
You don't know that.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.360
Aye, I do.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.080
Anyone?

34:58.080 --> 34:59.320
Erm...

34:59.320 --> 35:00.560
Yeah.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.280
Noel Timoney.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.760
He's not a client of Colin's.
He's his solicitor.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.960
Why would Colin be
coming to see him?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.720
I'll look into it.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.120
OK, I'll see you tomorrow.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.480
That's the hope.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.280
CAR HORNS BEEP

36:02.760 --> 36:05.160
We've been tracking
the movements of Colin Foyle,

36:05.160 --> 36:07.960
and it appears he met up with you
at Royal Down Yacht Club

36:07.960 --> 36:09.960
on Thursday the 10th.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.640
I can neither confirm nor deny that.

36:13.640 --> 36:14.960
Hm.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.440
You're his solicitor.
You saw him on the day he died.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.160
You may have been
the last person to see him alive.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.160
How do you think that looks to us?

36:22.160 --> 36:23.560
Well...

36:24.520 --> 36:27.880
..he did come to the yacht club,
aye. We had a drink.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.560
Why have you not come forward
with this before?

36:30.560 --> 36:33.680
There wasn't anything unusual
about our meeting.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.520
What did you talk about?

36:36.720 --> 36:38.360
We caught up.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.640
Family, old acquaintances.
I'm sure you can imagine.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.360
So no official business?

36:45.880 --> 36:48.600
Would you prefer to talk about this
at the station?

36:50.840 --> 36:55.600
He wanted to make an amendment to
his will and a payment to someone.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.000
To who?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.720
I can't disclose that.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.560
One of your clients changes his
will on the day he is murdered

37:04.560 --> 37:06.760
and you don't think to tell anyone?

37:08.040 --> 37:09.880
You have to understand,

37:09.880 --> 37:12.800
conversations about Colin's will
weren't irregular.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.560
He was a very thorough man.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.360
What was the amendment?

37:17.320 --> 37:19.920
I'd certainly need some
official documentation

37:19.920 --> 37:22.280
if I was going to show you that,
DCI Brannick.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.520
Until probate is granted, only
the executors are allowed to see it.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.280
I understand.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.280
Detective Chief Inspector Brannick?

37:35.280 --> 37:37.200
Yes. Thanks for calling me back.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.600
You wanted to know about
Olivia Deegan? That's right.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.840
And I'd love to help you,
but we have a lot of legal issues

37:43.840 --> 37:46.480
surrounding her departure
from our firm.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.680
Any information
you can share with me

37:49.680 --> 37:52.680
would be extremely useful
to an ongoing investigation.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.600
What did she do this time?

37:59.200 --> 38:01.800
I can't disclose that.
No, of course you can't.

38:01.800 --> 38:05.160
Erm, I shouldn't have said that.
Please, forget I said that.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.760
Listen, I'll have a word
with our lawyers here

38:07.760 --> 38:10.280
and see if there's anything
we can do to help you out.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.240
Much appreciated. Thank you.

38:12.240 --> 38:15.440
No problem. We're always on
the side of law enforcement.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.520
Noel Timoney said
that your father requested

38:26.520 --> 38:29.440
that something be added to his will
on the day he died.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.160
Have you any idea what it was?

38:32.480 --> 38:35.160
To be honest, Tom, we haven't
finished going through it.

38:35.160 --> 38:38.000
But I'll let you know
if we find anything of interest.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.240
Thanks. We just checked
the headlines, so we did.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.680
Made sure she wasn't
getting the lot.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.240
And she isn't? No, thank Christ!

38:48.240 --> 38:50.080
Actually, she's, erm...

38:51.240 --> 38:53.080
She's been written out of it.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.320
Oh. Noel says she agreed to it.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.240
But that doesn't sound right.

39:00.720 --> 39:04.680
Is that why you're having her
investigated? For when she objects?

39:04.680 --> 39:07.640
She's got a move up her sleeve,
we know it.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.720
And we need to be prepared for that.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.240
This is the fire starting
on the Dardis shed.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.960
You can see the petrol bomb
coming over the fence here.

39:28.520 --> 39:31.720
Do you think whoever did this
knew where our cameras were?

39:33.680 --> 39:35.480
I suppose it's possible.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.720
But Dardis would have known
where they were.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.600
He could have tipped someone off.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.040
Hm.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.040
Keep looking.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.480
The hessian sacking found
in your workshop

40:35.480 --> 40:38.560
has a long oil mark
running down the centre.

40:38.560 --> 40:43.640
Our analysis shows that oil to be
a match for the type of gun oil

40:43.640 --> 40:45.920
found in the recently recovered
M24 rifle.

40:45.920 --> 40:49.560
It's not the murder weapon, Lauren,
but it's the same type of rifle.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.360
Do you know where
the missing one is?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.760
No comment.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.680
Would you say that could be a rifle?

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
No comment. Do you know who that is?
No comment.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.120
But you do make ammunition. No...

41:11.920 --> 41:13.560
No comment?

41:19.200 --> 41:21.920
A concealed cabinet
in your workshop...

41:21.920 --> 41:23.920
That's never a good start.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.560
..containing a single-stage
loading press,

41:26.560 --> 41:28.880
primers and gunpowder.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.360
Our investigators say
that these items,

41:31.360 --> 41:33.760
along with the crucible
in your workshop,

41:33.760 --> 41:37.160
and certain moulds they have found,
present enough forensic evidence

41:37.160 --> 41:40.960
to suggest that you have been
casting and reloading ammunition.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.360
How long were you a member
of Real Republican Youth?

41:48.320 --> 41:49.760
Oh, aye.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.200
We have you being let off for a
caution at a demonstration in 1995.

41:53.200 --> 41:56.400
You were sticking up posters
saying "Disband the RUC".

41:57.840 --> 41:59.720
Know your audience, Lauren.

42:00.680 --> 42:04.040
No comment. Is that where you
were recruited as an armourer?

42:05.320 --> 42:08.080
No comment. Do you know who
killed Colin Foyle? No comment.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.000
Did you kill Colin Foyle?
No comment.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.360
Did you make the ammunition for the
murderer of Colin Foyle? No comment.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.040
Did someone come to collect
the ammunition from you?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.480
Did this man...

42:22.280 --> 42:24.880
..leave the piece
of hessian sacking behind

42:24.880 --> 42:26.680
that covered the murder weapon?

42:26.680 --> 42:28.360
No comment.

42:28.360 --> 42:31.280
How many times did you speak
to Robert Dardis? No comment.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.840
Lauren.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.040
Now we have the machinery
you used to make the ammunition...

42:56.720 --> 42:59.280
..how many other shootings
do you think ballistics

42:59.280 --> 43:01.120
will be able to connect you to?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.960
How many murders?

43:09.000 --> 43:11.160
I'd say you're going to prison,
Lauren.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.160
How you answer these questions
right now...

43:16.120 --> 43:19.440
..might just determine for how long.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.920
No comment.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.760
Please tell me you've something.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.320
The bomber...

43:44.280 --> 43:45.440
..was wearing a watch.

43:48.080 --> 43:51.240
That doesn't narrow things down.
But it might be a smartwatch.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.440
Can you track a signal?

43:54.440 --> 43:57.440
No, not unless we know
the phone it's tied to.

43:58.760 --> 44:01.440
So not much use, then.
Maybe more luck here.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.760
The matching footprints,
the gumboot.

44:05.720 --> 44:08.320
One by Colin Foyle's body,
the left footprint,

44:08.320 --> 44:11.920
and one in the garden where Dardis'
safe house was, the right footprint.

44:11.920 --> 44:13.280
Mm-hm.

44:13.280 --> 44:16.720
But we know Dardis' right foot
is in a protective brace.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.000
He couldn't have made this print
by the safe house.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.840
So this is the accomplice, then?

44:21.840 --> 44:23.200
Maybe.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.160
Have you checked
DC Ruddy's footwear?

44:27.160 --> 44:29.200
Yeah, nothing that matches. Argh!

44:29.200 --> 44:31.760
There's something
we're not seeing here.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.760
It does look like...

44:37.280 --> 44:41.080
What? Well, the difference between
the two...the two footprints.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.720
This one is worn away
and this one looks...looks new.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.760
So the accomplice favours
a particular brand,

44:49.760 --> 44:53.640
disposes of the contaminated ones
from the Foyle murder,

44:53.640 --> 44:56.360
buys a new pair to get Dardis.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.760
Unless...

45:05.280 --> 45:06.960
Doesn't matter.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.360
Boss?

45:48.360 --> 45:49.760
Sir.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.600
Inform the DCS.

46:25.520 --> 46:28.800
The hallmarks on
the gold are American.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.040
Made it easier to identify.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.840
Someone high up got on the phone
to the US

46:34.840 --> 46:37.600
and now they want us
to talk to the FBI.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.480
FBI?
Don't go all culchie on us, Tom.

46:41.480 --> 46:44.760
We don't want to scare them off
with our banjos and our buck teeth.

46:50.640 --> 46:54.920
Jackie. Niall, how are you?
Good. Come in.

46:54.920 --> 46:57.760
Sit yourselves down.
We'll get this call up and running.

47:09.720 --> 47:12.040
Assistant Director Paula Halcrow,

47:12.040 --> 47:14.960
this is Detective Chief
Superintendent Jackie Twomey

47:14.960 --> 47:16.720
and his team.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.720
How are you, Paula?

47:18.720 --> 47:20.800
I'm fine, thank you for asking.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.600
This is DCI Tom Brannick
and DS Niamh McGovern.

47:24.600 --> 47:29.320
They're running the investigation
that discovered the gold.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.920
Hm, nice job.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.920
Can I ask you, Paula,
what is your interest in this?

47:33.920 --> 47:36.480
I mean, it's not every day
we get dolled up

47:36.480 --> 47:38.760
to sit in front of the FBI.

47:38.760 --> 47:40.520
Hm, of course.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.760
What you found was one
of a consignment

47:43.760 --> 47:46.840
of eight 400 ounce gold bars
that were stolen in transit

47:46.840 --> 47:49.800
on their way to the Federal Reserve
in Boston in 1998.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.000
How are you with ounces? Mm...

47:55.000 --> 47:58.320
Sorry, Paula, could you give us
that in metric, please?

47:58.320 --> 47:59.360
Sure.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.800
That's 12 and a half kilos per bar.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.760
100 kilos in total.

48:05.760 --> 48:09.560
And so, in terms of cash,
how much are we talking about?

48:09.560 --> 48:12.160
Current value is $6 million.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.640
That's £4.5 million, I believe.

48:16.120 --> 48:19.240
Who stole it? They never
apprehended the perpetrators.

48:19.240 --> 48:22.160
But I spoke to our office in Boston
and they believe

48:22.160 --> 48:25.880
a criminal organisation called
the Savage Family are responsible.

48:25.880 --> 48:28.120
Is that their name
or their reputation?

48:28.120 --> 48:29.960
I think they trade off both.

48:29.960 --> 48:33.200
They're an Irish-American
crime family,

48:33.200 --> 48:35.440
strong links to your part
of the country.

48:35.440 --> 48:39.360
Used to work closely with
the Irish Northern Aid Committee,
but it says here that...

48:39.360 --> 48:41.280
Is that the same as NORAID? Aye.

48:41.280 --> 48:44.920
..the Savages disagreed with
the Committee's support
of the peace process.

48:44.920 --> 48:47.560
So do we think that the gold
was intended for the IRA?

48:47.560 --> 48:52.040
The same as all the other money
the Irish-American community
sent this way to fund terrorism?

48:52.040 --> 48:54.080
That's what we believe, yes.

48:54.080 --> 48:57.680
But there's no evidence to suggest
that it ever got to them?

48:57.680 --> 48:59.880
According to information
we received,

48:59.880 --> 49:01.680
the gold never reached the IRA.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.480
It was hijacked in transit.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.200
How did you learn that?

49:05.200 --> 49:06.960
We had an informant.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.640
You had? We...

49:10.640 --> 49:12.280
..mislaid him.

49:12.280 --> 49:14.480
Happens to the best of us, Paula.

49:14.480 --> 49:16.800
And the Savage Family?

49:16.800 --> 49:18.640
Are they still active?

49:18.640 --> 49:20.160
Absolutely.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.840
They've made a name for themselves
over the past 20 years.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.800
Doing what?

49:24.800 --> 49:28.040
They have a wide portfolio
of interests.

49:28.040 --> 49:31.240
Jesus, you make them sound
like an investment bank.

49:31.240 --> 49:34.000
They're one of the major players
in organised crime

49:34.000 --> 49:38.440
in the north-eastern United States,
so pretty close.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.240
I like this woman. Hm.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.680
Paula, would you be able
to keep an eye on them?

49:44.680 --> 49:48.760
You know, and let us know if anybody
is making noises about us over here?

49:48.760 --> 49:50.840
I can put the word out, sure,

49:50.840 --> 49:54.080
but beyond that you're talking
about a major redistribution

49:54.080 --> 49:57.880
of time and resources,
neither of which we have right now.

49:57.880 --> 49:59.920
So what do you want from us?

49:59.920 --> 50:02.360
We'd like to know
when you find our gold.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.600
And when you do,
you can return it to us.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.720
It would be much appreciated.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.080
Is that everything?

50:11.080 --> 50:13.080
Yes. Thank you, Paula.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.080
Speak again soon, hopefully.

50:15.080 --> 50:18.600
I hope so too. Thank you all.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.480
Get back to Lauren Fitzpatrick.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.840
Tell her we're going to
extradite her to the FBI

50:23.840 --> 50:25.680
unless she gives us something.

50:25.680 --> 50:28.920
Make it sound like we're picking out
her jumpsuit for Guantanamo.

50:28.920 --> 50:32.200
And you had a go at me for using
social services as a threat?

50:32.200 --> 50:34.120
Yeah, but I'm not bluffing.

50:36.880 --> 50:39.560
Colin brought it to me,
wrapped in the hessian sacking.

50:40.520 --> 50:42.560
He asked what I could do with it,

50:42.560 --> 50:45.240
whether there was a way
I could turn the gold into money.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.280
He thought I could melt it down.

50:47.280 --> 50:50.760
I looked at it and I knew
straight away what it was.

50:50.760 --> 50:53.200
The hallmarks and serial numbers.

50:54.240 --> 50:57.520
I was meant to have seen this gold
20 years before.

50:57.520 --> 51:00.760
I'd been expecting it then, but...

51:00.760 --> 51:01.800
..it never came.

51:04.280 --> 51:07.360
I told Colin I wouldn't do it.
It wasn't his gold to be selling.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.480
He didn't listen?

51:11.440 --> 51:13.280
He said he knew that.

51:13.280 --> 51:15.800
Said the man who owned
the gold was a client of his.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.960
But I knew that to be nonsense.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.840
It was meant for the IRA.

51:20.840 --> 51:24.520
So did you tell any of your
IRA contacts from back then?

51:25.840 --> 51:27.320
No.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.560
Why not?

51:30.400 --> 51:32.480
Colin was spooked enough.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.320
He gave me the bar, told me
to get on with turning it into cash

51:38.320 --> 51:40.400
while he went to check
some things out.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.720
After that, I didn't hear from him.

51:45.040 --> 51:46.680
Then he was shot.

51:46.680 --> 51:48.560
Leaving you with the gold?

51:50.160 --> 51:51.480
Aye.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.960
And you thought you'd keep it.

51:56.600 --> 51:59.320
The IRA no longer exist, after all.

52:03.840 --> 52:07.360
This client of Colin's...

52:07.360 --> 52:10.280
..the one he said owned the gold,
did he say who it was?

52:11.400 --> 52:13.040
An assassin.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.920
Say that again.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.160
Colin learned this assassin
was dead.

52:18.160 --> 52:20.680
That's why he thought
he could steal the gold.

52:22.880 --> 52:26.240
Who was it? The assassin?

52:26.240 --> 52:28.120
A man named Pat Keenan.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.520
Shot by your lot.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.680
Colin said you'd been looking
for him for a long time.

52:52.160 --> 52:53.600
Hello?

53:03.960 --> 53:05.640
Got your message.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.760
Did you really find the gold?

53:09.760 --> 53:11.240
One bar.

53:14.040 --> 53:15.680
We're in this together now.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.400
The gold belonged to Goliath.

53:38.720 --> 53:39.760
Here.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.960
I don't know how many times
I have to say this...

54:02.120 --> 54:04.000
..but Goliath is dead.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.440
I understand what you're saying,
sir, but what if we're wrong?

54:08.480 --> 54:10.480
What if he's still out there?
