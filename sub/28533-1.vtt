Get out of the road.

08:33.659 --> 08:36.498
You're gonna be killed
if you're not careful.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.332
What are you?

08:40.690 --> 08:41.523
Crazy?

12:17.690 --> 12:18.940
Time to play?

12:22.832 --> 12:24.082
Time to play.

13:06.980 --> 13:09.268
What are these people doing?

13:09.270 --> 13:11.388
Tim, I don't know.

13:11.390 --> 13:14.296
They look crazy, don't
mess with them, alright?

13:14.298 --> 13:15.898
No no, I got this, I got this.

13:17.050 --> 13:19.528
Hey, can we get out of the road?

13:19.530 --> 13:21.010
People have places to be.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.373
Well hello there,

13:26.418 --> 13:27.353
ladies.

13:30.330 --> 13:33.708
I kinda need you all to move
out of the road, like now.

13:33.710 --> 13:38.503
Who told you you
could drive on our road?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.330
Why are you doing this?

13:43.730 --> 13:45.748
Sir, I got a couple bucks
in my pocket if you need it,

13:45.750 --> 13:47.648
but I'm not interested in buying anything.

13:47.650 --> 13:50.443
You want us to get out of your way?

13:51.980 --> 13:53.333
Beg us.

13:55.980 --> 13:57.118
Can we move?

13:57.120 --> 14:00.518
We move when we want to move.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.908
We stop when we want to stop.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.978
And we dance when we want to dance.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.830
You guys aren't too bright, are ya?

14:14.590 --> 14:15.423
Can we move?

14:19.880 --> 14:22.553
You don't own me.

14:24.390 --> 14:26.108
Okay, where's the mom at?

14:26.110 --> 14:28.223
Is she as ugly as the rest of you guys?

14:29.300 --> 14:30.473
See you soon.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.830
You little thick up there too, buddy?

14:36.740 --> 14:37.723
These your kids?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.700
Real nice what you're
teachin' 'em out here.

14:42.920 --> 14:43.751
Where's the mom?

14:43.753 --> 14:44.803
She as ugly as you are?

14:47.480 --> 14:48.953
Isaiah, I miss Mom.

14:51.170 --> 14:54.473
You better not let Pa
hear you say that, Meg.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.223
Mom's gone.

14:59.810 --> 15:00.723
Pa killed her.

15:02.218 --> 15:04.418
No, you're a liar.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.578
You're a liar, Pa loved
Mom, he wouldn't do that.

15:07.580 --> 15:08.993
I heard them arguing.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.928
Mom said she was leaving him.

15:11.930 --> 15:15.357
She ran out the front
door and Pa ran after her.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.888
He picked up his ax.

15:17.890 --> 15:21.708
Isaiah, Pa loved Mom,
he wouldn't do that.

15:21.710 --> 15:24.588
You don't know anything, you don't know.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.153
I saw him kill her.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.653
He hit her in the back of the head.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.753
She fell down and then he,

15:33.823 --> 15:34.658
he killed her.

15:36.861 --> 15:37.803
He killed her.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.693
I'm gonna go ask Pa where Mom is.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.418
Stop, this has gotta end.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.648
- Are you serious?
- Come on, now, man.

15:56.650 --> 15:57.538
- Really?
- Look what

15:57.540 --> 15:58.371
you've done.

15:58.373 --> 15:59.317
Look what you did.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.148
Yeah, that's gonna cost a
lot of money to clean this car.

16:05.150 --> 16:07.273
Appreciate it, man.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.743
Backwoods hillbillies,
get out of the road.

16:16.750 --> 16:19.393
There we go, let's speed it up.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.830
Pa, where's Mom?

16:59.980 --> 17:00.813
Gone.

17:01.710 --> 17:04.063
She's gone and she ain't coming back.

17:05.369 --> 17:10.369
Ungrateful, I spent 20
years in those mines

17:10.380 --> 17:13.483
putting a roof over your
head and food on the table.

17:14.579 --> 17:17.907
I miss Mom, she used to sing to me

17:17.910 --> 17:20.038
to help me fall asleep, and...

17:20.040 --> 17:21.468
She's gone, I said.

17:21.470 --> 17:23.538
What are you, stupid?

17:23.540 --> 17:25.308
Do you hear me?

17:25.310 --> 17:29.464
She's gone and she ain't coming back.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.721
I'm sorry.

17:30.723 --> 17:33.078
I'm sorry, I still love you the best.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.873
I'm sorry, I'll never
mention her again, I'm sorry.

17:42.081 --> 17:43.403
Don't you fret none.

17:45.570 --> 17:46.923
Daddy still loves you.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.003
There's gonna be some changes around here.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.493
Yeah, there's gonna be some big changes.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.588
I'm tired of bein' walked on,

17:59.590 --> 18:02.393
I'm tired of people lookin'
down at me and mine.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.403
Morning, Jon.

18:25.991 --> 18:27.216
How's it going?

18:27.218 --> 18:29.233
What do you care, you writin' a book?

18:30.160 --> 18:32.548
No sir, just trying to be friendly.

18:32.550 --> 18:35.268
Sheriff, me and you
ain't never been friends.

18:35.270 --> 18:39.753
So why don't you run along and
be friendly to somebody else?

18:40.900 --> 18:42.393
You drinkin' again, Jon?

18:50.230 --> 18:51.063
Nope.

18:52.940 --> 18:53.773
Okay.

18:55.881 --> 18:57.888
Thought I'd just check
to see how you, Karen,

18:57.890 --> 19:00.598
and the kids were doin', hadn't
seen you in town in a while.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.278
Yeah, we got everything
we need right here.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.623
We don't like to be around
you self-righteous fools.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.593
Jon,

19:13.350 --> 19:14.833
you weren't always like this.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.748
I remember when we were kids.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.458
Yeah, we ain't kids no more, Sheriff.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.138
And I ain't tryin' to hold hands

19:22.140 --> 19:25.313
with you and skip down memory lane.

19:26.470 --> 19:28.648
Don't you worry about me and mine.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.598
What you better worry about is that

19:30.600 --> 19:33.039
pretty little girl of
yours I see out alone

19:33.041 --> 19:36.468
- all the time at night.
- Is that a threat?

19:36.470 --> 19:38.388
Better be careful, Sheriff.

19:38.390 --> 19:40.418
Boogeyman might just snatch her up.

19:40.420 --> 19:41.988
Is that a threat?

19:41.990 --> 19:45.195
You as much as look at her,
Jon, that's the end of ya.

19:45.197 --> 19:47.728
If you as much as look at her.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.033
Get off my property.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.033
We're gonna be the reason
they're afraid of the dark.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.423
Pa, Pa.

20:10.030 --> 20:11.193
You know what, girl?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.843
You're just like your mother.

20:15.050 --> 20:17.840
You talk way too much.

20:33.210 --> 20:35.323
Time to hunt.

20:57.617 --> 21:01.700
I see you in there.

21:04.900 --> 21:09.303
Come out, we just want
to play a game with you.

21:19.493 --> 21:22.993
You all are no fun, why don't you open up?

21:29.914 --> 21:33.581
Some people just don't
know how to have fun.

21:36.973 --> 21:38.505
- Hello?
- Tim.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.860
Tim, it's the crazy
clowns out on the road.

21:40.862 --> 21:42.353
We know you're in there.

21:42.355 --> 21:43.361
How did they find us?

21:43.363 --> 21:44.868
I don't know, I told
you not to mess with them.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.003
I didn't think they would come here.

21:47.005 --> 21:49.793
Well what if they hurt the baby?

21:49.795 --> 21:52.216
The baby, what about us?

21:52.218 --> 21:53.409
Us?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.099
Tim, that's the big one?

21:57.101 --> 21:58.351
He's got an ax.

22:15.220 --> 22:18.803
Little pig, little pig,

22:21.069 --> 22:21.902
let me in.

22:54.757 --> 22:57.793
Come out, come out wherever you are.

23:04.460 --> 23:07.304
The girl is mine.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.873
You say we're monsters.

23:46.050 --> 23:49.243
You say we have no soul.

23:53.180 --> 23:56.993
You hate us, you fear us.

24:00.470 --> 24:03.920
Oh, you look like you took
quite a fall there, pal.

24:03.922 --> 24:05.043
How are you feeling?

24:08.300 --> 24:09.133
What's that?

24:10.343 --> 24:12.023
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.224
Why don't we have a little
taste of it, shall we?

24:16.226 --> 24:20.223
I hope you're ready.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.483
This part is going to tickle a lot.

24:29.070 --> 24:30.093
It'll be okay.

24:34.527 --> 24:35.610
Go on, do it.

24:49.390 --> 24:53.908
In case you haven't noticed,
my sister loves to slice.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.310
Let's do it again, shall we?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.183
Ooh, beautiful.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.868
You're not going anywhere, buddy,

25:03.870 --> 25:05.233
you're staying right here.

25:06.210 --> 25:09.323
Go on, keep doing it, don't stop now.

25:16.830 --> 25:17.893
Don't stop now.

25:24.910 --> 25:26.343
At least he knows manners.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.543
Do it again.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.701
Hmm, looks like he's
not gonna answer me now.

25:37.703 --> 25:38.534
Why don't we show him what happens

25:38.536 --> 25:40.328
when he doesn't answer us.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.163
Again.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.828
Yes, you're just making
this harder on yourself.

25:51.830 --> 25:53.458
Stop struggling.

25:53.460 --> 25:56.663
You are all just weak sheep.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.063
Baa baa sheep.

26:07.479 --> 26:08.323
Baa baa sheep.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.280
The wolf is at the door.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.187
Not a whole lot of room
to hide in here, huh?

26:26.500 --> 26:29.048
Let me ask you, how'd you end up

26:29.050 --> 26:31.553
with that piece of human trash, anyway?

26:33.270 --> 26:37.433
Let me guess, dad died
when you were young,

26:40.020 --> 26:45.020
mom workin' all the time,
had to pack your own lunch.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.553
Guess, are you a peanut
butter and jelly girl?

26:51.400 --> 26:52.613
Feel free to answer.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.728
Then you went off to college

26:56.730 --> 26:58.533
'cause you made such good grades,

27:01.350 --> 27:05.543
met Mr. Wonderful and his red sports car.

27:18.660 --> 27:22.843
So Prince Charming there
swept you off your feet.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.497
Then all the sudden.

27:40.030 --> 27:42.033
It's just a matter of time, girl.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.590
Isaiah, Meg, come here.

27:52.470 --> 27:53.513
Pa needs us.

28:05.094 --> 28:05.927
Help.

28:07.792 --> 28:10.166
I'm coming, are you okay?

28:10.168 --> 28:14.145
Here, I got the baby, I
got the handcuff keys.

28:14.147 --> 28:16.451
We gotta get out of here, downstairs.

28:16.453 --> 28:18.573
There's a gun in the bedroom.

28:18.575 --> 28:20.791
Okay but here, let me put your sock on.

28:20.793 --> 28:22.431
It's gonna help with the bleeding.

28:28.670 --> 28:29.963
They're in the bedroom.

28:31.780 --> 28:33.783
The fool has a gun.

28:36.130 --> 28:41.130
Isaiah, show her how weak he really is.

29:04.729 --> 29:06.143
Shoot him, protect your
family and shoot him.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.436
I knew you wouldn't be

29:22.438 --> 29:24.238
brave enough to protect your family.

29:25.570 --> 29:28.298
It's a real shame, I can only imagine

29:28.300 --> 29:31.793
how your poor child must
feel when you're older.

29:41.650 --> 29:43.291
Take her baby.

29:45.039 --> 29:47.116
Please don't take my baby.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.164
Please don't.

29:51.834 --> 29:56.292
Please don't take my baby.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.047
Please don't take my baby, please.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.882
Please don't take him.

30:03.808 --> 30:05.975
Please don't hurt my baby.

30:21.627 --> 30:23.543
Bring him back alive.

30:26.573 --> 30:28.438
I have plans for him.

32:33.877 --> 32:37.617
You're crazy, you're all crazy.

32:37.619 --> 32:39.523
Why are you doing this to us?

32:40.770 --> 32:42.763
You're all alone, little girl.

32:44.570 --> 32:46.218
Your husband done jumped out the window

32:46.220 --> 32:49.613
and left you alone with us crazy people.

32:50.909 --> 32:53.451
He loves us, he will be back for us.

32:53.453 --> 32:56.218
Yeah he loves you so much he jumped

32:56.220 --> 32:59.293
out the window and left you here to die.

33:01.300 --> 33:04.043
You're right, though, he'll be back.

33:06.068 --> 33:11.068
He'll be back when Isaiah hunts
him down and drags him back.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.953
- No.
- He left you!

33:16.850 --> 33:19.728
He left you and your baby here to die.

33:19.730 --> 33:22.518
Girl, are you stuck on stupid?

33:22.520 --> 33:23.723
Open your eyes.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.190
We haven't harmed you or your baby.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.308
Well?

34:14.310 --> 34:15.413
Am I gonna be a daddy?

34:16.520 --> 34:17.353
No.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.947
I mean, the doctor said it was gonna be

34:19.949 --> 34:21.672
a one in a million chance.

34:22.815 --> 34:25.578
But, I mean, I wanna try to be that one.

34:25.580 --> 34:28.447
Listen, when I married
you two years ago,

34:28.449 --> 34:30.838
I married you for better or for worse.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.253
I love you, with or without a child.

34:35.820 --> 34:38.047
I just feel I want a child,

34:38.050 --> 34:41.038
a little you and me running
around here, y'know?

34:41.040 --> 34:43.078
Don't wish that on us.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.018
Y'know, I wanna have you a son.

34:45.020 --> 34:47.958
I know you want a son, like right?

34:47.960 --> 34:48.893
I just want you.

34:53.149 --> 34:55.791
You're the best husband
a girl could ask for.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.892
I know, maybe now's
not the time for a son.

35:04.330 --> 35:07.843
So you tell me, who is the real villain?

35:09.720 --> 35:11.143
Are you sure it's us?

36:49.810 --> 36:51.238
Come out and fight me like a man.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.274
Are you a coward?

37:20.110 --> 37:21.003
Like a man?

37:26.711 --> 37:29.628
What do you know about being a man?

37:33.370 --> 37:36.733
You ran away and left
your defenseless baby.

37:41.748 --> 37:44.003
I'll, I'll kill you.

37:44.900 --> 37:45.823
Kill me?

37:47.949 --> 37:52.900
You're no killer, I know
killing, I know pain.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.923
You're soft, you're pathetic.

37:59.410 --> 38:00.690
You're a parasite.

38:03.893 --> 38:05.890
You're a worm under my foot.

38:09.460 --> 38:14.225
You were born with a
silver spoon but no balls.

38:44.310 --> 38:46.738
You can have the
baby, you take the wife.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.038
Have fun, buddy, you can have it all.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.193
Please, please don't kill me, please.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.043
The real villains don't wear makeup.

38:57.680 --> 39:02.063
They wear three piece suits
and sell their family for $1.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.273
I know who I am.

39:10.050 --> 39:11.773
I am the pain I feel inside.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.703
Your soul is black as midnight.

39:25.209 --> 39:29.326
I think it's time, Pa has plans for you.

39:35.142 --> 39:39.285
Hm, I wonder what I
should do with him now.

39:39.287 --> 39:40.837
That's a pretty bad wound, boy.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.538
No, Pa told me he was going

39:45.540 --> 39:47.428
to do it and he'd take care of it.

39:47.430 --> 39:48.528
I don't think Pa would mind

39:48.530 --> 39:50.853
if I just left a few more scratches.

39:52.210 --> 39:56.177
Oh, just mm, I would love to do some more.

39:58.399 --> 40:02.538
Pa will be angry, I don't
know what he might do

40:02.540 --> 40:03.790
after what he did to Mom.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.770
I would love to do more to
the last of your pretty face.

40:11.530 --> 40:13.430
I don't think Pa would mind if just.

40:20.030 --> 40:23.347
Still though, you're being loads of fun.

40:27.623 --> 40:28.673
Have all the fun, Pa.

40:31.340 --> 40:32.193
Not fair.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.110
Maybe after Pa is finished
with him, he'll give it to me.

40:43.590 --> 40:45.707
Just for once, I want to do something.

40:48.030 --> 40:48.863
Still.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.733
It's a shame, really.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.104
He gets to have all the
fun, I just get to watch.

41:13.007 --> 41:14.090
Fun for once.

41:16.691 --> 41:19.550
I'm sure he won't mind
if I do a few first.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.497
Make a few lacerations here

41:35.845 --> 41:36.678
or here.

41:39.160 --> 41:39.993
Maybe even here.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.553
No.

41:52.105 --> 41:55.272
I suppose I should take him to Pa now.

42:00.110 --> 42:01.988
Pa, I got him.

42:01.990 --> 42:04.078
He was running away and I caught him.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.893
I did just like you
said, I didn't kill him.

42:07.985 --> 42:10.368
You mean you caught him
running back to the house

42:10.370 --> 42:14.101
to save his precious wife and baby.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.828
Right, Isaiah?

42:16.830 --> 42:19.763
No Pa, he was running
hard in the other direction.

42:23.220 --> 42:26.017
He wasn't trying to
save nobody but himself.

42:41.724 --> 42:42.557
Get up.

43:00.390 --> 43:01.223
Kill him.

43:05.972 --> 43:07.892
- Kill him.
- No, please

43:07.894 --> 43:11.077
don't make me do this,
please don't make me do this.

43:11.079 --> 43:13.162
I'm begging you, I can't.

43:15.334 --> 43:16.501
I can't do it.

43:19.094 --> 43:20.122
What are you doing?

43:27.784 --> 43:30.201
Please don't make me do this.

43:34.365 --> 43:38.903
Kill him or Isaiah will kill your baby.

43:42.170 --> 43:45.838
Isaiah, if she hasn't killed him

43:45.840 --> 43:49.049
in five seconds, kill the baby.

43:49.051 --> 43:52.459
I can't, please
don't make me do it, please.

43:52.461 --> 43:54.461
- 1,001.
- No.

43:56.393 --> 43:58.770
- 1,002.
- Kill him!

43:58.772 --> 44:00.730
No, I can't do it.

44:00.732 --> 44:01.565
1,003.

44:02.899 --> 44:05.123
Oh, please don't hurt the baby.

44:05.125 --> 44:07.641
1,004, last chance, do it.

46:55.293 --> 46:57.293
Welcome to the family.

48:06.060 --> 48:11.060
Enoch, my son, you are
the hope for a new world.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.133
A better world.

48:14.720 --> 48:19.343
The world we live in is
full of sheep, blind sheep,

48:20.486 --> 48:22.777
ripe for the picking by the wolves.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.813
You will protect the
sheep from the wolves.

48:28.110 --> 48:29.733
You will be their shepherd.

48:30.930 --> 48:34.963
You will continue my work
way after I am dead and gone.

48:35.960 --> 48:39.288
I am teaching you the way of the strong,

48:39.290 --> 48:40.673
the way of the lion.

48:41.970 --> 48:44.518
The sheep drive their motorized coffin

48:44.520 --> 48:46.913
to work as slaves for the rich.

48:47.930 --> 48:51.823
To fight for the scraps thrown
from their master's table.

48:53.350 --> 48:55.978
Only to work until their bodies can work

48:55.980 --> 48:59.813
no longer for their cruel overlords.

49:01.330 --> 49:04.448
And then they are put
six feet into the dust

49:04.450 --> 49:07.790
where their loved ones cry tears of blood

49:08.840 --> 49:12.310
and the rich laugh and count their gold.

49:14.190 --> 49:17.633
You, Enoch, you will be their savior.

49:18.880 --> 49:21.143
You will save them from themselves.

49:22.340 --> 49:24.628
You will save them from their lust

49:24.630 --> 49:27.093
of the rich man's gold and silver.

49:28.650 --> 49:31.183
You will sit in judgment of the rich.

49:32.250 --> 49:36.793
You will be their judge
and their executioner.

49:38.730 --> 49:43.163
You, Enoch, will be the swift
and brutal hand of justice,

49:44.100 --> 49:47.693
making the rich bleed for their sins.

49:49.110 --> 49:53.393
You will not die for the
sheep, you will kill for them.

49:54.660 --> 49:58.333
Avenging them against the
evil men who love money.

49:59.780 --> 50:03.393
By doing this, Enoch, you will
cleanse the world of greed.

50:04.680 --> 50:08.118
You will cleanse the world
of the hatred and strife

50:08.120 --> 50:12.283
between brothers and sisters
caused by the man of sin.

50:13.930 --> 50:16.508
This evil was brought by the rich

50:16.510 --> 50:19.763
so that they could profit
from the death of the poor.

50:21.630 --> 50:26.630
Enoch, my son, the quest
before you is a holy quest

50:26.910 --> 50:31.910
against Satan himself, a quest
that will right the wrongs

50:32.380 --> 50:34.973
of the serpent and his children,

50:36.440 --> 50:40.283
a quest to expose their
lies to the whole world,

50:41.580 --> 50:45.168
a quest to light a fire so massive

50:45.170 --> 50:49.697
and so intense that
all the world will burn

50:50.650 --> 50:52.853
to cleanse it of the men of evil.

50:54.550 --> 50:57.788
By your hand, Enoch, blood will flow

50:57.790 --> 51:00.013
through the world like a great river.

51:02.880 --> 51:07.880
By your hand, my son, all
of the world will be saved.

54:12.014 --> 54:14.588
Are you okay, you okay?
