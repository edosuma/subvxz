WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.375
-<i>Previously on</i> The Recruit:
-Why am I here?

00:08.458 --> 00:10.958
Because I can't show up in Belarus
empty-handed.

00:11.041 --> 00:12.791
If I have to testify

00:12.875 --> 00:15.583
about how I allowed rockets
in the hands of terrorists,

00:15.666 --> 00:19.083
you're gonna have to testify about
how you ended up on a cartel drug train.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.500
That would be bad.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.083
At the moment, I need you,
and you need me.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.666
Unless you've gone
and told the lawyer too much.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.041
-I know you're sleeping with him.
-He's a useful tool.

00:28.125 --> 00:29.666
Have you ever been in love?

00:29.750 --> 00:32.541
Here I am, invested in the guy
that you could be

00:32.625 --> 00:34.625
if you just got your shit together.

00:34.708 --> 00:37.166
-You're breaking up with me?
-This thing you do

00:37.250 --> 00:40.458
where you stumble through serious stuff
and hope it works out,

00:40.541 --> 00:42.291
it's too 20-something for me.

00:42.916 --> 00:46.708
The case officer that told an asset
your former nickname is Xander Goi.

00:46.791 --> 00:48.500
I went to Vienna. Next thing I know,

00:48.583 --> 00:50.875
someone tries to kill me
on the way to the airport.

00:50.958 --> 00:51.916
Fuck!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.708
-Do you know who I need to bribe?
-Lev Orlova.

00:54.791 --> 00:57.791
Definitely don't have enough money.
Can you un-sanction a Swiss bank account?

00:57.875 --> 01:00.166
The only way to unlock
is to get it excluded by the bank.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.875
Who do I have to talk to about that?

01:01.958 --> 01:03.583
I want a date with your roommate.

01:03.666 --> 01:07.291
I will release the sanctions for one hour,
that's the only way they go unnoticed.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.458
The asset had a child that died. I didn't
wanna give Dawn emotional leverage.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.333
I just don't trust Dawn Gilbane.

01:12.416 --> 01:14.416
I agree. Which is why I'm sending you.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.125
I'm sending you to Geneva
to backstop Hendricks.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.541
We'll drop you in Italy
where you'll continue on by car.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.083
You excited? You're going home.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.750
First, we need to survive the journey.

01:35.541 --> 01:38.041
I promise to bring it back
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:38.125 --> 01:39.458
It's a reference book.

01:39.541 --> 01:42.166
It can't leave the library
under any circumstances.

01:42.250 --> 01:45.291
Okay, then is there any way
I can stay past closing?

01:45.375 --> 01:48.750
The exam is tomorrow, and this is
the book the professor always quotes.

01:48.833 --> 01:52.125
Which is really frustrating, because
it's 40 years old and out of print.

01:52.208 --> 01:53.250
No exceptions.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.500
-You've got four minutes till we close.
-Please.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.625
-Three minutes. You're wasting time.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.000
Hi.

02:16.125 --> 02:16.958
Hey.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.000
I'm Owen.

02:18.083 --> 02:18.916
What?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.916
I'm Owen. I'm in your contract law class.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.750
I've never seen you before in my life.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.583
Really?

02:26.666 --> 02:27.791
Here, hold on.

02:31.625 --> 02:32.500
How about now?

02:37.875 --> 02:38.833
Okay.

02:38.916 --> 02:40.750
Yeah. Whatever.

02:47.541 --> 02:49.500
You know, you could just take the book.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, that would be stealing.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.541
We're studying to be lawyers.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.083
Those two don't go together.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.958
You're gonna return it tomorrow, right?

02:57.041 --> 03:00.416
So technically it's just borrowing
a book from a library,

03:00.500 --> 03:03.208
which is kind of
the whole point of a library.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.166
Hey.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.625
We're closing. I'll need that book back.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.333
Come on, really?

03:20.083 --> 03:22.583
You should live a little.
What's the worst that could happen?

03:22.666 --> 03:27.208
Uh, academic probation,
expulsion, charges of theft?

03:27.291 --> 03:31.125
Come on.
No, that would not happen.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.500
None of those things.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.125
Okay, look, dude.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.250
Owen.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.500
If this is an attempt to hit on me,
I'm not interested.

03:37.583 --> 03:41.875
It's not. I'm just trying to help a fellow
student, and you seem super stressed.

03:41.958 --> 03:42.791
I'm fine.

03:42.875 --> 03:43.916
You sure?

03:48.166 --> 03:49.208
-Please?
-No.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.375
Law library.

03:58.458 --> 04:01.208
Hey, I hate to ruin your night,

04:01.291 --> 04:03.875
but there's a dude in one of
the study carrels pleasuring himself.

04:03.958 --> 04:05.708
-What?
-Yeah, super grotesque.

04:05.791 --> 04:07.541
He's got a shirt over his head
for some reason

04:07.625 --> 04:10.000
and he's working that thing
like he's trying to start a fire.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.291
You need to get back here now,
before there's a janitorial issue.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.625
Have a blessed night.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.291
Get the book.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.166
Come on, get the book.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.500
Get the book.

04:35.875 --> 04:36.916
Lift it up.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.208
-I can't believe I just did that.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.541
Why did I do that?

04:42.625 --> 04:44.416
Well, you had a need.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.250
Okay, if we all just start running around,
breaking the rules because of our needs,

04:48.333 --> 04:50.291
it'll be the end of civilization.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.500
Clearly you're new
to this being a rebel thing,

04:52.583 --> 04:54.375
but I live here and, trust me,

04:54.458 --> 04:57.250
borrowing a reference book is not
gonna lead to the end of civilization

04:57.333 --> 04:58.500
as we know it.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.375
But if you're super wracked with guilt,
I'll take the book,

05:03.458 --> 05:05.666
come back, return it tomorrow. No biggie.

05:07.166 --> 05:10.000
So you wanted me to steal it
so you could use it?

05:10.083 --> 05:11.041
What?

05:11.125 --> 05:12.875
No, absolutely--

05:13.583 --> 05:15.208
Yeah. I mean, a little bit.

05:15.291 --> 05:18.333
But now that we've crimed together,
we might as well study together.

05:18.416 --> 05:21.083
-I promise I'm not gonna hit on you.
-Yeah, right.

05:23.375 --> 05:24.375
Seriously, okay?

05:24.458 --> 05:28.708
I will park my ass in the friend zone
for the rest of the semester.

05:28.791 --> 05:32.166
I will be the best study partner
you've ever had in your entire life

05:32.833 --> 05:34.333
and then I'll hit on you.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.083
Deal?

05:39.791 --> 05:40.625
Deal.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.375
I don't wanna be your boy toy.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.125
But that's just ego talking.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.791
It's the perfect cover.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.791
Young, hot, stupid.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.833
Fine, but when we get to Geneva,
I'm gonna go shopping.

06:02.916 --> 06:05.000
Hit a spa, gonna get my nails done.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.208
Don't be annoying.

06:09.875 --> 06:13.291
You know, this is a uniquely
dangerous moment for us, Owen.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.666
Geneva's a Russian mafia playground.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.458
You think the Russians
are gonna know you're in town?

06:19.541 --> 06:22.833
I think we need to get in, get my money,
and get out before we find out.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.416
I'd feel more confident if Xander Goi
wasn't running the operation.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.791
Just forget Goi.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.875
From now on,
we can only rely on each other.

06:31.416 --> 06:34.000
As long as our interests align.

06:34.791 --> 06:37.041
That's what you said way back when,

06:37.125 --> 06:38.833
when I asked if I could trust you.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.416
Are you saying that's changed?

06:45.125 --> 06:47.875
I think we're way past interests aligning.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.000
We are tied to each other.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.250
Whether you like it or not.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.291
Where's Owen?

07:11.750 --> 07:13.208
Out of town.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.500
Do you know where?

07:14.583 --> 07:16.833
I don't know, probably somewhere cold.

07:16.916 --> 07:18.458
He stole my winter jacket.

07:18.541 --> 07:19.833
Who? A jealous ex?

07:19.916 --> 07:21.833
No, Owen.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.791
Hannah's trying to figure out
where he went.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.000
Ah! Geneva.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.208
Oops, I think that was
supposed to be a secret.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.416
I was helping him
with the foreign sanctions issue.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.083
He sounded pretty stressed about it.
Said it was a life-or-death thing.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.458
-Don't answer.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.375
Hi, Mom.

07:45.458 --> 07:48.291
<i>I'm in your neighborhood</i>
<i>and I thought I could drive you to work.</i>

07:48.375 --> 07:49.875
Oh, that's nice.

07:49.958 --> 07:52.416
But I'm actually just walking out
the door right now.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.375
<i>Great, I'm ten minutes away.</i>
<i>Maybe 20. See you downstairs.</i>

08:20.166 --> 08:23.666
-What are you doing?
-Hey, just relax, boy toy.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.791
Your cover is literally arm candy,

08:25.875 --> 08:30.250
so if I want to squeeze your arm
or I want to grab your ass...

08:31.208 --> 08:32.666
then you will love it.

08:32.750 --> 08:36.500
When this is all over,
I'm gonna file a complaint with HR.

08:37.375 --> 08:38.916
Good luck with that.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.416
The eagle has landed.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.625
The eagle?

08:49.708 --> 08:51.333
More like the idiot.

08:52.041 --> 08:55.375
Yeah, sort of lacks
an operational panache.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.541
<i>Plus, we're here to support Hendricks.</i>

08:57.625 --> 08:59.708
<i>If he's successful,</i>
<i>that's good for the agency.</i>

08:59.791 --> 09:00.625
Checking in.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.458
<i> Yeah, but it's bad for us.</i>

09:03.541 --> 09:05.458
I mean, if he pulls this off,

09:05.541 --> 09:07.083
he's gonna be untouchable,

09:07.166 --> 09:10.666
and if he finds out we're spying on him,
he's gonna bury us.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.458
Even though Nyland sent us?

09:12.541 --> 09:16.041
Don't be naïve.
General Counsel has no allegiance to us.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.375
Which is why
we have to look out for ourselves.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.916
You hang the failures on Hendricks

09:22.000 --> 09:25.583
and pin the victories on us.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.291
I like that. Up top.

09:35.666 --> 09:39.000
Welcome to Geneva. I'll be your
operational support while you're here.

09:39.083 --> 09:39.916
We heard.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.958
Xander, you remember Max Meladze.

09:42.041 --> 09:45.875
Hey, revealing a CO's real name
is a fucking breach of protocol.

09:45.958 --> 09:48.375
So is trying to kill an agency lawyer.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.833
I didn't try to kill an agency lawyer.

09:50.916 --> 09:52.250
Yes, you did, Xander,

09:52.333 --> 09:55.708
because you thought I gave Owen
kompromat on you, which I didn't.

09:55.791 --> 09:58.916
And I still haven't,
but I will if you give me a reason to.

10:00.416 --> 10:02.125
There's no need for threats.

10:02.208 --> 10:06.041
Well, threats is what got me here
so I think I'll stick with them.

10:07.208 --> 10:11.458
But, hey, look, if you play nice,
then we all win, no?

10:13.041 --> 10:13.875
Fine.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.708
Let's go over the plan.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.125
Sure thing.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.875
Tomorrow, we go to the Bank of Geneva

10:19.958 --> 10:21.916
and access one
of Max's sanctioned accounts,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.625
which will magically be unsanctioned
between 10 and 11 a.m.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.500
Now, once the money is secure,

10:26.583 --> 10:29.666
Max will reach out to Lev Orlova
and set a meeting

10:29.750 --> 10:32.791
so she can buy her way out
of the Russian mafia doghouse.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.208
And then I get to go home
and sleep for a week.

10:37.541 --> 10:38.916
You make it sound easy.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.041
No, I'd say it's uncomplicated,
though I am sure that that will change.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.958
Does Kirill know I'm here?

10:46.916 --> 10:48.250
The local mafia boss.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.666
If he doesn't, he will.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.208
Half the staff is on his payroll.

10:54.041 --> 10:57.250
So keep a low profile
until you hit the bank in the morning.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.375
All goes well,
you're wheels up by lunchtime.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.375
Hm.

11:01.916 --> 11:02.833
Oh...

11:03.375 --> 11:06.458
Uh, a flash cable came for you
at the consulate.

11:09.958 --> 11:10.833
Thanks.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.083
You think he bugged the place?

11:27.791 --> 11:29.500
I know he bugged the place.

11:45.916 --> 11:49.000
I gotta go to the consulate.
Can I trust you to stay out of trouble?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.541
Absolutely not.

11:51.625 --> 11:52.958
Max, seriously.

11:53.041 --> 11:57.375
Take a bath, order room service,
go to the spa. I'll be right back, okay?

11:58.166 --> 11:59.166
Yes, sir.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.875
-Hello?
-Max found all your cameras.

12:27.958 --> 12:30.125
My 5-year-old niece
could've hid them better.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.875
You don't have a niece.

12:31.958 --> 12:33.583
<i>How the fuck do you know that?</i>

12:33.666 --> 12:35.458
Have you been in my file, Goi?

12:35.541 --> 12:37.125
<i>Like you haven't been in mine.</i>

12:37.208 --> 12:39.541
We're competing for the same promotion.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.583
Oh, please. It's no competition.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.208
You're a house pet. I'm a predator.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.458
The job's gonna be mine,

12:46.541 --> 12:48.916
so you should really just
try not to fuck up my op.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.708
I love your confidence,

12:50.791 --> 12:54.458
but the job requires a smooth operator,
not a blunt instrument.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.791
Yo, yo!

12:55.875 --> 12:56.708
Hey!

12:56.791 --> 12:58.500
-Looking good, DG.
-Thank you.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.625
Head upstairs.

12:59.708 --> 13:02.958
There's beer in the mini-fridge.
Don't touch my gluten-free bread.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.916
Mission planning meeting in 30.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.125
Copy that.

13:06.791 --> 13:08.291
-<i>Was that Standish?</i>
-Yeah.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.000
His team just landed.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.000
<i>We'll be ready for our part,</i>
<i>so don't fuck up yours.</i>

13:13.083 --> 13:14.500
Big hug.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.125
So how's work?

13:19.958 --> 13:21.000
Fine.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.375
Why did you pick me up
with a coffee and a pastry?

13:23.458 --> 13:25.375
Did our cat die?

13:26.916 --> 13:28.625
How are things with Jeff?

13:29.375 --> 13:32.708
Well, he invited me
to his sister's wedding this weekend.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.583
So I guess that's a thing.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.833
Wonderful.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.500
I like him for you.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.041
Okay, now I know you're up to something.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.291
What's going on?

13:42.375 --> 13:44.000
Jeff is special assistant

13:44.083 --> 13:46.708
to the president
for economic policy, right?

13:48.458 --> 13:49.291
Yeah.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.666
There's something Jeff could help me with
since he works at the White House.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.791
-It requires some delicacy.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.541
So I feel it's better coming through you.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.291
I need to know who attended
an appropriations meeting

14:01.375 --> 14:03.750
with the chief of staff last Thursday.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.333
Are you asking me to spy for you?

14:06.833 --> 14:08.250
I'm asking for a favor.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.666
I have a new client. He needs to know
if his competition was in the same room.

14:11.750 --> 14:15.625
No, I don't feel comfortable
using my boyfriend as an informant.

14:15.708 --> 14:18.958
That's how things work in Washington.
Access and favors.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.083
How do you think you got your job?

14:29.083 --> 14:30.583
Pretty quiet around here.

14:30.666 --> 14:31.833
I hadn't noticed.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.625
Really? Kitchens, Ebner
and Hendricks all out of the office?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.875
-That's gotta be related, right?
-I don't know and I don't care.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.791
Wait. Why do you?

14:39.875 --> 14:42.000
Because unlike the rest of you cowards,

14:42.083 --> 14:45.083
I would rather be in the know
if there's a shitstorm coming.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.916
Uh, pass.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.833
I would much rather step out
into the street and get hit by a bus

14:49.916 --> 14:51.875
than get a cancer diagnosis.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.958
-Quick death, you know what I mean?
-Mm.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.583
Except death is never quick around here.

15:02.041 --> 15:02.875
No, no.

15:02.958 --> 15:05.916
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

15:10.583 --> 15:11.541
<i>What?</i>

15:11.625 --> 15:14.083
It's Owen, I'm in a SCIF at the consulate,
you wanted to talk?

15:14.166 --> 15:15.291
Yeah, hi, Owen.

15:15.375 --> 15:19.625
I just wanted to have a little chitty-chat
about how monumentally fucked we are.

15:19.708 --> 15:22.000
Why? What's happening now?

15:22.083 --> 15:25.166
Well, apparently our missing rockets
have been traced

15:25.250 --> 15:28.916
from Lázaro Cárdenas
to the Port of Tangier.

15:29.541 --> 15:30.375
Uh-huh.

15:30.458 --> 15:33.541
<i>Which means they are most likely</i>
<i>headed to South Sudan.</i>

15:35.416 --> 15:37.375
Let me put this into perspective for you.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.291
It's basically where a fuck ton
of terrorists call home, Owen.

15:40.375 --> 15:41.500
Okay, that's bad.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.916
But you said
the missiles were deactivated.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.166
Wake up, Owen.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.125
Their operational functionality
means jack squat.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.666
If the press gets ahold of this,

15:49.750 --> 15:51.416
<i>it's game over for us.</i>

15:51.500 --> 15:53.958
<i>"CIA gives missiles to terrorists."</i>

15:54.041 --> 15:56.250
Front page, above the fold!

16:00.041 --> 16:01.541
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

16:04.375 --> 16:05.208
<i>Owen?</i>

16:05.291 --> 16:07.208
Janus, shut up and let me think.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.833
You need to make it more confusing.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.458
What?

16:19.541 --> 16:23.375
<i>The scandal, Janus.</i>
<i>Americans don't do complicated.</i>

16:23.458 --> 16:26.750
It's why Watergate's still talked about,
but Iran-Contra isn't, right?

16:26.833 --> 16:30.166
People still aren't sure
what drug-dealing rebels in Nicaragua

16:30.250 --> 16:31.958
<i>have to do with hostages in Lebanon.</i>

16:32.041 --> 16:36.541
So if you think that this thing
is really gonna go sideways,

16:36.625 --> 16:40.041
you need to figure out how to attach
as much nonsense to it as possible

16:40.125 --> 16:42.791
<i>so</i> The New York Times
<i>can't write an easy headline.</i>

16:44.208 --> 16:47.291
That is the stupidest...

16:48.375 --> 16:51.458
most potentially genius thing
you've ever thought of.

16:51.541 --> 16:55.541
I know. Now, muddy the waters enough,
and no one will be able to get traction.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.333
While you're doing that,
try to get those rockets back.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.958
Missiles, actually.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.375
Missiles, whatever.

17:03.916 --> 17:05.041
Fuck you.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.000
Who is it?

17:25.083 --> 17:26.416
The concierge, madame.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.625
I have the gift you sent me to get.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.500
-Is it the model with GPS in it?
-Yes.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.791
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

17:38.875 --> 17:40.083
No. Thank you.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.250
Whatever you have on tap.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.458
Hi.

18:21.541 --> 18:22.791
Tequila and lime, please.

18:22.875 --> 18:23.958
On the rocks.

18:34.458 --> 18:35.291
Thanks.

18:39.666 --> 18:40.875
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:40.958 --> 18:41.958
How's it going?

18:42.416 --> 18:43.666
Um...

18:44.250 --> 18:45.583
-Better now.
-Mm.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.250
Yeah. I hear that.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.333
I'm Owen.

18:51.708 --> 18:52.541
Marta.

18:55.666 --> 18:56.625
Rough day?

18:57.625 --> 19:00.166
Mm... I mean,

19:00.250 --> 19:02.833
rough enough that I'm drinking alone
at 5:00 on a Tuesday.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.416
But you're not drinking alone.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.625
Not anymore.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.500
-Cheers.
<i>-Skál.</i>

19:11.583 --> 19:13.416
Yeah, <i>skál. </i>You from Geneva?

19:15.083 --> 19:18.166
No, just for now, while I finish school.

19:19.166 --> 19:20.041
I see.

19:20.125 --> 19:20.958
You?

19:21.833 --> 19:23.250
In town for a meeting.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.791
And then back to America?

19:26.875 --> 19:28.916
-Oh, wow, it's that obvious?
-No.

19:29.791 --> 19:30.625
No, it's good.

19:30.708 --> 19:34.958
I love an American accent.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.666
Well, I mean I like...

19:39.291 --> 19:40.833
whatever you got going on.

19:41.458 --> 19:42.708
Swedish?

19:42.791 --> 19:43.708
Icelandic.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.708
Does that make you a Viking?

19:46.791 --> 19:49.416
Because kissing a Viking
has always been on my bucket list.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.666
Only kissing?

19:59.541 --> 20:03.250
So, what do you do
that requires a meeting in Geneva?

20:03.333 --> 20:05.875
I'm a boy toy.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.625
Just a stupid inside joke.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.333
I'm supporting a friend.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.541
Oh...

20:11.625 --> 20:14.250
Actually, less of a friend,
more of a work...

20:15.125 --> 20:17.125
colleague-slash-evil nemesis.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.375
It's all...

20:18.458 --> 20:19.958
a fucking gray area.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.583
I'm, like, hanging on by my fingertips.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.333
Okay.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.541
That's, um...

20:28.458 --> 20:30.791
She sounds like a lot.

20:30.875 --> 20:31.750
Well, she's, uh--

20:37.541 --> 20:39.500
I never said "she."

20:41.500 --> 20:43.125
I just assumed.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.833
Handsome guy like you.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.166
Holy shit, I know what's going on here.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.833
-I should hope so.
-No, no, no, you--

20:54.875 --> 20:57.666
The accent, the flirting,
the leading questions.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.458
You're a foreign agent.

21:02.125 --> 21:02.958
What?

21:03.458 --> 21:06.625
Yes, you're trying
to get kompromat on me, right?

21:06.708 --> 21:08.875
We go upstairs, we fool around,
you get the sexy photos,

21:08.958 --> 21:10.791
and boom, you blackmail me.

21:11.708 --> 21:13.625
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.125
Come on. I'm not mad.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.333
Why would I be mad? This is awesome.

21:20.958 --> 21:23.625
I've got to go, sorry.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.916
-What? No.
-Yeah, this just got weird.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.958
No, no, no, don't leave, come on.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.625
You were really convincing.
You had me for two sec--

21:30.708 --> 21:32.791
It's my first time being sexpionaged, I--

21:34.958 --> 21:36.708
My first time being sexpionaged.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.208
Everything okay at the consulate?

21:53.458 --> 21:54.291
Oh, yeah.

21:55.458 --> 21:56.500
Yeah, it's fine.

21:56.583 --> 22:00.166
Just another case that I'm working.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.583
-Mm.
-All quiet at the hotel?

22:04.291 --> 22:05.500
Yeah, all quiet.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.250
I can't believe you did this for 10 years.

22:31.375 --> 22:34.916
Yeah. It's already starting
to trigger my PTSD.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.500
The extreme boredom...

22:37.416 --> 22:40.250
combined with the fear that
at any moment things could go haywire,

22:40.333 --> 22:41.625
destroy your career.

22:42.458 --> 22:45.083
Yeah, but you're a lawyer now, remember?

22:45.958 --> 22:47.875
You're not in charge of this op.

22:47.958 --> 22:50.750
We're just here to make sure
that McWeeny doesn't screw up.

22:51.791 --> 22:53.916
Oh, that steak looks so good.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.333
They clearly have
the hots for each other.

23:02.166 --> 23:04.125
You think they're sleeping together?

23:04.208 --> 23:05.625
Not necessarily.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.875
But it's not a good sign
for Owen's neutrality.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.750
Have you ever slept with an asset?

23:11.833 --> 23:15.166
Sure. But I never got
emotionally involved with any of them.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.166
Them?

23:23.375 --> 23:25.583
How come you never made a pass at me?

23:29.208 --> 23:31.416
Are we seriously gonna have
this conversation

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
in this moldy-ass camper van?

23:33.583 --> 23:34.583
Yeah.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.875
I've never had a relationship
that didn't end ugly.

23:42.583 --> 23:46.416
I guess I like you too much
to screw us up.

23:58.166 --> 23:59.541
What are you doing?

23:59.625 --> 24:03.125
-I am documenting Owen's infractions.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.333
In case we need
to make a case against him.

24:05.416 --> 24:06.750
You mean destroy him.

24:06.833 --> 24:08.666
Oh, tomato, tomahto.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.083
I got you something.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.916
Since you'll be rid of me soon,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.375
I wanted you to have something
to remember me by.

24:54.791 --> 24:56.041
Wow, um...

24:56.833 --> 24:57.791
Thank you.

24:58.666 --> 25:03.291
I mean, this is like the nicest thing
that anyone's ever gotten for me.

25:05.791 --> 25:06.791
Try it on.

25:23.333 --> 25:24.333
Yeah. It's great.

25:24.416 --> 25:25.958
-It looks good.
-Yeah?

25:28.791 --> 25:31.375
I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.791
No, you got me here.

25:39.416 --> 25:41.375
So, what's going home look like?

25:42.208 --> 25:45.041
Best case scenario, this all goes to plan.
What's your life?

25:45.125 --> 25:47.625
Where do you live? What do you do for fun
on a Saturday night?

25:47.708 --> 25:48.583
Don't do that.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.500
Do what?

25:52.750 --> 25:55.708
There's no point in asking me
questions like that

25:55.791 --> 25:58.416
when I know
they'll just end up in my file.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.041
No, they wouldn't.

26:06.083 --> 26:10.750
Owen, if push came to shove

26:10.833 --> 26:14.666
and you knew you had something to gain
from telling the agency my secrets,

26:14.750 --> 26:15.666
you would.

26:16.333 --> 26:20.041
So I'm doing you a favor by not sharing.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.708
Is that you saying you're never gonna
tell me what you have on Goi?

26:26.791 --> 26:28.458
No, fuck that guy.

26:32.166 --> 26:35.333
When Xander was stationed in Belarus,
he was having an affair...

26:36.000 --> 26:37.541
with Kirill's wife.

26:37.625 --> 26:38.708
Damn.

26:39.791 --> 26:41.416
I didn't think he had it in him.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.000
I mean, clearly Kirill
doesn't know, right?

26:47.083 --> 26:49.583
Kirill knew his wife was having an affair,

26:49.666 --> 26:50.958
but he didn't know who with.

26:51.041 --> 26:53.666
He tortured a few people hunting for it.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.875
Offered a bounty
when that didn't work out.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.916
Yeah, well,
no wonder Xander's scared of you.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.583
You could have him killed and fired.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.750
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

27:08.833 --> 27:11.291
-Will you get us dessert?
-Yeah, sure.

27:45.916 --> 27:46.750
Who are you?

27:46.833 --> 27:48.625
Kirill sent me.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.166
-To kill me?
-No.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.000
Liar. Say goodbye to your brain.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.750
Wait. I swear.

27:53.833 --> 27:57.791
He asked me to find out
what the fuck you're doing in Europe.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.250
You're coming for him?

28:00.166 --> 28:01.208
Well, I wasn't.

28:01.291 --> 28:03.583
But now I feel a little bit upset.

28:03.666 --> 28:05.625
You can tell your boss
I came here in peace,

28:05.708 --> 28:07.916
but I can just as easily go to war.

28:08.708 --> 28:11.333
If Kirill wants to ask me
any more questions,

28:11.416 --> 28:13.750
he can call me on your phone, okay?

28:38.041 --> 28:39.375
Let's forget dessert.

28:41.583 --> 28:42.416
Let's go.

28:53.125 --> 28:55.458
I-- I'll take the couch, I guess.

28:56.583 --> 29:00.083
Hey, do you mind if I get
into the bathroom really quick

29:00.166 --> 29:02.541
before you commandeer the whole--? What?

29:04.791 --> 29:05.666
Max.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.541
I need this.

29:09.583 --> 29:10.708
You need this.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.166
Stop letting me be the one instinct
that you don't follow.

30:41.750 --> 30:42.666
Here, babe.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.291
Gotta replenish those electrolytes.

30:53.666 --> 30:56.625
Oh! That was awesome.

30:57.583 --> 30:58.416
Yeah.

31:03.750 --> 31:04.583
Jeff?

31:05.333 --> 31:06.208
Yeah?

31:08.166 --> 31:09.250
Never mind.

31:09.708 --> 31:11.500
No. What's on your mind?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.083
It's just a work thing.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.625
Lay it on me. Maybe I can help.

31:20.208 --> 31:23.583
Okay, well, we have a meeting
with a big potential client,

31:23.666 --> 31:27.166
but the partners are keeping it
really hush-hush.

31:27.250 --> 31:30.166
All I know is that this person attended
an appropriations meeting

31:30.250 --> 31:31.833
with the chief of staff last week.

31:32.833 --> 31:36.208
There were a few people
in that meeting with Kevin.

31:37.583 --> 31:39.708
-Do you know anything else?
-No.

31:40.875 --> 31:43.416
And I normally wouldn't ask...

31:44.500 --> 31:47.583
but I just feel like
I'm falling behind at work,

31:47.666 --> 31:50.166
and I need to get the partners' attention.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.083
Okay.

31:55.166 --> 31:59.666
It was Bill Connelly
and Tracy Jimenez from JPMorgan,

31:59.750 --> 32:02.833
and Lucinda Jackson from Vanguard.

32:03.333 --> 32:06.708
Okay, I'll research all of them and wait
to see who walks through the door.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.375
-Thank you.
-I'm sure you'll do great.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.500
Just so you know,

32:34.416 --> 32:37.041
I never reported
that you lost your daughter.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.708
Some things are none of their business.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.166
Thank you.

32:59.208 --> 33:00.208
Get some sleep.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.125
We have a big day tomorrow.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.750
Here we go.

33:51.291 --> 33:54.666
Okay, we have 59 minutes to get this done,

33:54.750 --> 33:58.125
then I'm on a plane to D.C.,
and you are back in the game.

33:59.125 --> 34:01.791
Do I detect a little sadness
in your voice?

34:02.416 --> 34:03.625
Going to miss me?

34:04.875 --> 34:06.958
No. Are you gonna miss me?

34:08.166 --> 34:09.000
No.

34:10.833 --> 34:13.583
Hi, we're here to see Markus Fischer.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.416
-Please?
-<i>Morning.</i>

34:16.500 --> 34:18.291
-Morning.
-How may I be of service?

34:19.500 --> 34:22.416
I need to withdraw some money
from my account.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.416
Certainly. I'll need the account number
and your access code to begin.

34:41.375 --> 34:44.416
I'm afraid I'm unable to access
the account. It's been frozen.

34:47.208 --> 34:51.375
Uh, no, that account has been
unfrozen actually, trust me.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.708
You can check again.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.000
Sir, the account has been
sanctioned by the United States.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.958
Not only can I not access it,
but protocol demands

34:58.041 --> 35:01.458
that I notify the OFAC that an attempt
was made to access the account.

35:01.541 --> 35:02.666
No. Don't do that.

35:02.750 --> 35:06.083
Please, give me two minutes.
I gotta make a call. I'll be right back.

35:06.166 --> 35:09.083
-Sir, I'm afraid that the--
-Two minutes. Relax.

35:09.875 --> 35:10.916
I promise.

35:14.791 --> 35:15.791
<i>What did you do?</i>

35:16.541 --> 35:18.291
I may have messed up the times.

35:18.375 --> 35:19.750
-You got the time wrong?
-Yeah.

35:19.833 --> 35:22.333
-I gave you a fucking watch last night.
-Hey, whoa.

35:22.416 --> 35:25.041
I assumed when Linus
gave me the time window

35:25.125 --> 35:27.000
that he converted it to Geneva.

35:27.083 --> 35:31.500
Now I'm thinking he meant 10 a.m. in D.C.,
so we're about six hours early.

35:31.583 --> 35:35.208
-You need to fix this.
-I'm going to. Sit tight.

35:44.583 --> 35:45.833
Something's wrong.

35:48.125 --> 35:48.958
Where's Max?

35:49.791 --> 35:52.833
Shit! I knew this was
going to go sideways.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.916
<i>Your call has been--</i>

36:35.458 --> 36:37.583
-What's wrong?
-<i> Nothing.</i>

36:40.166 --> 36:41.625
But you sound stressed.

36:41.708 --> 36:44.958
-Is there a problem at the bank?
-<i>No. I'll call you when it's done.</i>

36:45.041 --> 36:46.916
I gotta keep this line clear.

36:53.625 --> 36:55.083
-It's him.
-He's calling.

36:55.583 --> 36:58.375
-Pick up, pick up. Just pick it up.
-Pick it up? What am I--?

36:59.375 --> 37:00.625
Hello?

37:01.125 --> 37:03.416
Hey, man, sorry to call you so early.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.625
I need you to get me out of a jam.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.291
What's up?

37:08.375 --> 37:10.375
I mixed up the times
on my sanction window,

37:10.458 --> 37:13.000
and I can't get in touch with my OFAC guy.

37:13.583 --> 37:16.250
Think you could go over to my place
and see if he's there?

37:16.958 --> 37:18.541
<i>He's dating my roommate.</i>

37:18.625 --> 37:22.958
-Uh, yeah, man, no can do.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.541
Yeah, I got some kind of stomach bug.

37:25.625 --> 37:28.000
Gotta stay within five feet of the john.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.958
Okay, thanks. Feel better.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.458
Salazar.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.291
Hey, it's me.

37:56.583 --> 37:59.208
Oh, this isn't a sad attempt
at a booty call, is it?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.708
No. No, I'm in Geneva.

38:03.791 --> 38:06.666
Okay, well, if you're not calling
to get back together, what do you need?

38:06.750 --> 38:11.166
I need you to go over to my place,
see if my roommate Terence is there,

38:11.250 --> 38:13.750
<i>and if his OFAC boyfriend</i>
<i>is sleeping over.</i>

38:13.833 --> 38:16.916
-Yeah, I'm not doing that.
<i>-Please? I--</i>

38:17.666 --> 38:18.750
I fucked up.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.000
<i>I need help.</i>

38:24.083 --> 38:25.541
What's your address?

38:43.250 --> 38:44.375
Good morning.

38:44.458 --> 38:45.625
Owen isn't here.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.250
Oh, I know. Owen sent me.

38:47.750 --> 38:48.875
What's going on?

38:48.958 --> 38:50.541
Which one of you is Linus?

38:50.625 --> 38:53.666
Owen needs to speak with you.
There's been an issue in Geneva.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.583
Okay. Shit, just give me a minute.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.375
Is Owen okay?

39:01.458 --> 39:03.250
I'm not allowed to disclose that.

39:03.333 --> 39:05.041
You are at my house
at 4:00 in the morning.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.458
I need to know he's okay.

39:11.041 --> 39:12.125
He is, for now.

39:12.916 --> 39:15.166
But knowing him, it won't last.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.750
He'll find another shark tank
to dive into.

39:18.291 --> 39:20.333
No, there's nothing I can do.

39:21.041 --> 39:23.958
Once an account has been flagged,
it can't be unfrozen.

39:24.041 --> 39:27.375
-You'll have to figure something else out.
-<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

39:31.500 --> 39:35.708
-We could rob the bank.
-No, we're not fucking robbing a bank.

39:35.791 --> 39:37.666
You're right, Swiss banks are fortresses.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.458
Croatian banks are doable.

39:40.958 --> 39:43.291
What? I don't see you
coming up with any ideas.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.583
Owen, where are you going?

40:04.125 --> 40:05.041
Move.

40:11.583 --> 40:12.791
What the hell?

40:18.958 --> 40:20.333
Hey. What's up?

40:20.875 --> 40:24.500
Wow, I guess Nyland
really doesn't think I can finish the job.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.500
-We were sent as a backstop.
-To help you.

40:26.583 --> 40:30.041
Bullshit. Nobody sends lawyers to help.

40:30.125 --> 40:33.166
You're here to blame Owen
if this thing goes sideways, which it has.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.041
That's it.
I'm gonna silver-lining this shit

40:35.125 --> 40:37.250
by taking full advantage
of your clandestine experience

40:37.333 --> 40:39.125
in overcoming
the fuck out of this obstacle.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.625
Move over, we're getting in.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.250
-Where are you going?
-Owen needs us.

40:57.250 --> 41:01.333
No, if he's in real trouble, the CIA
will do what's called an exfiltration.

41:01.416 --> 41:03.333
Terence, he's not a spy, he's a lawyer.

41:03.416 --> 41:06.958
Even if he was one,
you know he's allergic to asking for help.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.166
So you want to fly to Geneva
to rescue him?

41:10.250 --> 41:12.833
Hannah, it's been two years
since you guys broke up.

41:12.916 --> 41:14.875
I'm not-- It is not about that.

41:14.958 --> 41:18.208
You and I are the only people
who give a shit about him.

41:18.291 --> 41:20.833
If we don't look out for him, no one will.
So get packed.

41:20.916 --> 41:22.958
I booked us two first-class tickets
on the 6 a.m.

41:23.041 --> 41:26.416
-Car is picking us up in 20 minutes.
-I have work.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.375
Yeah, in a windowless office
that smells like sadness.

41:29.458 --> 41:34.000
Whereas first-class seats turn into beds,
you get warm cookies during takeoff,

41:34.083 --> 41:36.875
and I think you get free drinks
during the whole flight.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.416
-Okay, I'll call in sick.
-Uh-huh.

41:44.750 --> 41:47.500
So you screwed up the time zones?

41:47.583 --> 41:51.250
Yes. It's hilarious, but it's not relevant
to the problem that we're facing now.

41:51.333 --> 41:53.750
Okay? We need to get Max's money
out of that account.

41:54.291 --> 41:56.583
What the actual fuck is going on?

42:00.083 --> 42:02.791
Kitchens?
What the hell are you doing in my op?

42:02.875 --> 42:05.708
-Did Dawn send you to backstop me?
-No, I'm with OGC.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.666
We were sent to backstop Hendricks.

42:07.750 --> 42:10.375
By inserting yourself in my operation
without notifying me?

42:10.458 --> 42:12.166
Hi, Violet Ebner. You wanna climb in,

42:12.250 --> 42:15.166
so the world doesn't see
into our covert clown car?

42:20.708 --> 42:23.708
Owen screwed up.
The accounts are still frozen.

42:25.375 --> 42:28.125
-I need to call Dawn and fill her in.
-On what?

42:28.208 --> 42:31.708
The fact you lost control of your
operation, or you never fucking had it?

42:32.666 --> 42:34.875
What if we go in there
and say that we're the IRS

42:34.958 --> 42:38.125
and working a tax evasion case,
and we need access to the account?

42:38.208 --> 42:39.041
For what?

42:40.166 --> 42:42.916
To withdraw money owed
as back taxes to the government.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.666
No, that's a shit idea.

42:44.750 --> 42:47.958
And impersonating an employee
of the United States is a federal crime.

42:48.041 --> 42:50.041
Technically, we are federal employees.

42:50.125 --> 42:51.875
This isn't some regional bank
in the sticks.

42:51.958 --> 42:54.791
It's the vaults where the Nazis
hid stolen Vermeers.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.375
Security is tight. They check credentials.

42:57.458 --> 42:59.916
Oh, my God. How did we lose
the Cold War to you people?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.041
No, we're making this too complicated.

43:02.125 --> 43:05.250
We work at the fucking CIA.
What is the entire mandate of the agency?

43:06.166 --> 43:07.958
-Fuck over China.
-Fuck over China.

43:08.041 --> 43:10.083
To gather intelligence.

43:10.750 --> 43:13.708
Exactly, and to use that intelligence
to get leverage.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.291
There's gotta be something
on this banker or that bank

43:16.375 --> 43:18.750
that we can use as leverage
to get Max's money.

43:18.833 --> 43:23.000
I have something,
but it can only be used as a threat.

43:23.083 --> 43:25.000
I'm a rock star at threatening.

43:25.666 --> 43:26.541
What is it?

43:29.416 --> 43:32.708
-Hi, we back.
-Sir, as I explained earlier--

43:32.791 --> 43:35.666
Yes, I remember quite clearly,
but now is a bit different.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.708
I need you to give us
access to her account.

43:37.791 --> 43:41.291
Otherwise, we are gonna have
to do something about this one.

43:43.500 --> 43:46.125
We know that you're using
that account to launder money

43:46.208 --> 43:50.041
for a criminal conglomerate
that has ties to a, shall we say,

43:50.125 --> 43:51.750
terrorist organization.

43:51.833 --> 43:54.666
Unless you want the rest of the world
to know about that,

43:54.750 --> 43:57.000
which you don't,
you'll do the typie-typie thing

43:57.083 --> 43:59.708
and print out a banker's check
for the entirety of her account.

44:00.541 --> 44:01.541
Hm...

44:02.916 --> 44:04.750
If you know about this account,

44:05.250 --> 44:09.541
it means that you are from
an intelligence agency monitoring it.

44:09.625 --> 44:14.541
I'm going to assume CIA,
since you're American.

44:15.291 --> 44:17.583
But here's what I also know.

44:17.666 --> 44:22.333
The CIA wouldn't burn that account
by exposing it, because then...

44:23.250 --> 44:26.041
they wouldn't be able to follow
the money going through it.

44:26.125 --> 44:30.000
Which means that you are an empty threat.

44:30.083 --> 44:32.333
So kindly get lost.

44:32.416 --> 44:34.125
Enough of this bullshit.

44:34.666 --> 44:36.916
His people might not be
able to burn that account,

44:37.000 --> 44:41.541
but my people will literally
burn you alive when they find out

44:41.625 --> 44:44.625
that you have become an asset for the CIA,

44:44.708 --> 44:48.416
helping monitor all that
criminal and terrorist activity

44:48.500 --> 44:50.250
that runs through your bank.

44:50.333 --> 44:51.666
That's a lie.

44:52.250 --> 44:56.916
Who cares? All we have to do is let it
be known that you're friends of ours,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.041
and you'll end up dead
in a Swiss alleyway,

44:59.125 --> 45:02.208
which is actually
the nicest of all alleyways.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.958
Hey, would you mind
holding that for a second?

45:06.041 --> 45:08.375
-Sure.
-Thank you so much.

45:08.458 --> 45:10.416
But dead is dead, right?

45:10.500 --> 45:12.625
So why don't you just do
what we're asking you to do,

45:12.708 --> 45:14.916
and live a much longer,
healthier, happier life?

45:16.791 --> 45:20.291
Even if I wanted to,
I can't give you access to her account.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.791
It was locked the second
I tried to access it earlier.

45:22.875 --> 45:25.666
Oh, I have a safety deposit box.

45:27.208 --> 45:30.000
He could open it, give us access to it.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.125
Yes. That I can do.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.083
Please.

45:54.083 --> 45:56.291
Hi, Jeff.
I can't really talk right now. I--

45:56.375 --> 45:58.458
-<i>I got fired.</i>
-What?

45:58.541 --> 46:00.958
<i>They think I've been leaking</i>
<i>sensitive information.</i>

46:01.041 --> 46:03.875
<i>I can't help it that I'm excited</i>
<i>to tell people about my job.</i>

46:03.958 --> 46:05.833
<i>I got walked out by a Marine.</i>

46:05.916 --> 46:08.208
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

46:08.291 --> 46:09.208
What's wrong?

46:10.333 --> 46:11.708
I got Jeff fired.

46:11.791 --> 46:12.958
What? How?

46:13.041 --> 46:15.833
<i>You didn't tell anyone</i>
<i>about our conversation, did you?</i>

46:16.791 --> 46:18.166
No, of course not.

46:18.666 --> 46:20.416
<i>I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.</i>

46:20.500 --> 46:22.333
-Actually, Jeff--

46:31.708 --> 46:33.958
-<i> Good morning.</i>
-You got Jeff fired?

46:34.041 --> 46:36.500
<i>Kevin Mills asked me</i>
<i>to help him find the leak.</i>

46:36.583 --> 46:39.250
I know I wasn't entirely
forthcoming with you.

46:39.333 --> 46:40.916
You lied to my face.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.333
I knew you wouldn't help me
if I told you the truth.

46:43.416 --> 46:45.875
That is such bad parenting.

46:45.958 --> 46:48.791
<i>Sweetheart, sometimes we all</i>
<i>have to put on our big girl pants</i>

46:48.875 --> 46:50.916
<i>and do unpleasant things</i>
<i>for the greater good.</i>

46:51.000 --> 46:55.416
Now, the chief of staff to the president
owes me a huge favor, and I owe you one.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.541
Everybody wins.

46:56.625 --> 46:58.083
Except Jeff.

46:58.166 --> 47:00.708
<i>Omelets and eggs, darling.</i>
<i>Eggs and omelets.</i>

47:05.500 --> 47:08.750
I'm a weak and horrible person,
and I'm going to hell.

47:11.625 --> 47:14.166
-Can I ask you something?
-I know what you're gonna say.

47:14.250 --> 47:16.750
And, no, this trip
is not about Owen, okay?

47:16.833 --> 47:17.791
It's really about me.

47:17.875 --> 47:21.083
I'm running away from all the things
I need to confront in my own life.

47:21.166 --> 47:25.000
My awful family, my dehumanizing job,
my really fucked-up moral compass.

47:25.083 --> 47:27.000
I'm feeling lost and afraid,

47:27.083 --> 47:29.291
and going to save Owen
is giving me a sense of purpose

47:29.375 --> 47:33.083
at a time that I need to feel like
a living, breathing human being again.

47:33.708 --> 47:36.916
I was just going to ask if I could give
your airplane pajamas to Linus.

47:37.583 --> 47:39.750
But, yeah, all that stuff is pretty true.

47:49.750 --> 47:53.125
Return it to the spot when you're done,
and please, never come back.

47:59.916 --> 48:02.500
-Uh, where's the money?
-There isn't any.

48:03.500 --> 48:05.416
-Diamonds?
-No.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.041
So how is this gonna help you
buy your way back in?

48:08.125 --> 48:10.541
Because this is equally as valuable.

48:10.625 --> 48:12.833
What is it, bearer bonds?
Stock certificates?

48:12.916 --> 48:13.958
Kompromat.

48:15.791 --> 48:19.125
-Here, take this.
-No, I'm good. Thanks, you can have it.

48:19.208 --> 48:21.083
No, I already have one.

48:21.166 --> 48:23.583
Took it off Kirill's guy
when I beat him up last night

48:23.666 --> 48:25.750
-in the bathroom in the restaurant.
-You did--?

48:27.125 --> 48:31.000
-Is that why we skipped dessert?
-Yeah. Take the gun.

48:31.083 --> 48:32.041
Fuck.

48:45.958 --> 48:47.125
What was her name?

48:50.125 --> 48:51.208
Karolina.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.416
You wanna take it?

48:56.750 --> 48:57.625
No.

48:58.458 --> 48:59.333
Put it back.

49:00.166 --> 49:03.541
I'm gonna call Kirill, arrange a meet.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.875
-It's Max.

49:16.958 --> 49:18.708
We need to meet.

49:22.458 --> 49:23.875
We're on for tonight.

49:24.500 --> 49:28.166
-What are we gonna tell the others?
-Nothing. Find the back door, sneak out.

49:28.250 --> 49:31.458
No, no, no. Hold on.
The whole point of having a support team

49:31.541 --> 49:36.333
is so that they can be there to help us,
so we don't get... killed.

49:36.833 --> 49:39.250
Okay, trust me.
Owen, I was an asset for ten years,

49:39.333 --> 49:41.875
and I learned the hard way
you don't tell anyone anything

49:41.958 --> 49:45.000
-unless you absolutely have to.
-Sounds like a convenient way to do

49:45.083 --> 49:47.166
whatever you want
without asking permission.

49:47.250 --> 49:51.333
You can't honestly tell me that you think
your co-workers wouldn't sell you out

49:51.416 --> 49:53.750
if they thought it'd help their career.

49:58.791 --> 50:02.875
Never give anyone
the opportunity to betray you.

50:03.750 --> 50:06.166
Rather apologize after you survive

50:06.250 --> 50:08.708
than die because you trusted
the wrong person.

50:12.708 --> 50:15.250
-Let me see your phone.
-Why?

50:21.791 --> 50:22.625
Wait.

50:24.250 --> 50:28.041
There. You can put it back in
once we've done the deal with Kirill.

50:45.125 --> 50:46.000
They're gone.

50:46.916 --> 50:49.958
According to the banker,
they accessed her safe deposit box

50:50.041 --> 50:53.000
-30 minutes ago and split out the back.
-Oh, my...

51:01.625 --> 51:03.916
A lot of people
want you dead, Max.

51:07.708 --> 51:11.083
And yet, I'm still here.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.083
Who is this?

51:15.666 --> 51:16.625
A killer.

51:21.541 --> 51:23.375
He looks like a child.

51:24.125 --> 51:26.083
What better disguise?

51:28.625 --> 51:29.916
It won't matter.

51:31.125 --> 51:33.833
He can't save you
if I decide to end your life.

51:34.541 --> 51:39.583
Well, then you will never
find out who slept with Stasia.

51:40.541 --> 51:41.791
Max, you can't.

51:44.833 --> 51:47.625
You knew who was with my wife
and you never told me?

51:48.708 --> 51:50.625
It wasn't to my advantage then.

51:53.333 --> 51:54.208
The bounty.

51:55.208 --> 51:57.166
Is it still 2 million euros?

51:59.541 --> 52:00.583
It is.

52:01.583 --> 52:04.291
How do I know
that what you'll tell me is true?

52:05.708 --> 52:06.541
Well...

52:10.458 --> 52:12.250
I have pictures.

52:13.375 --> 52:14.791
Of the two of them.

52:16.458 --> 52:17.500
Together.

52:18.208 --> 52:19.791
For hours.

52:28.166 --> 52:29.333
Do we have a deal?

52:31.375 --> 52:32.291
Pay her.

52:32.375 --> 52:33.208
No.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.833
Send it to Lev.

52:36.875 --> 52:40.000
Consider it a down payment
for a future conversation.

52:49.875 --> 52:52.916
I intend to make amends,
so I can come home.

52:53.458 --> 52:56.375
You know there are people
who will never welcome you back,

52:57.083 --> 52:59.208
no matter how much money you offer.

53:00.041 --> 53:00.916
I know.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.125
That's what I have him for.

53:14.083 --> 53:15.458
What did you just do?

53:15.541 --> 53:17.250
What I had to, to survive.

53:20.791 --> 53:22.708
I'm so close to going home.

53:27.250 --> 53:29.333
Max, you better be fucking in here.

53:35.291 --> 53:37.708
-I am so dead.

54:24.458 --> 54:25.375
We gotta go.

54:32.041 --> 54:33.375
What the hell is this?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.083
-Is that Owen?
-What? Where?

54:41.166 --> 54:43.166
Hannah? Hannah, wait. Hold up.

54:46.916 --> 54:47.750
No.

55:00.208 --> 55:01.750
I think I just saw Hannah.
