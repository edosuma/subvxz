01:22.666 --> 01:24.001
- Good evening.

01:25.044 --> 01:26.921
What can I do for ya?

01:28.089 --> 01:30.299
- [Kiya] I want some milk.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.053
- You want some milk?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.641
- [Kiya] I want some milk.

01:41.018 --> 01:41.811
- Okay.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.606
I'll go get you some milk.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.068
What kind of milk do you want?

01:49.068 --> 01:51.070
You want whole milk?

01:51.070 --> 01:53.155
Skim milk, chocolate milk?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.057
What is this?

02:23.519 --> 02:27.731
Is this some kind of weird
internet prank video thing?

02:31.777 --> 02:35.114
I take it you don't
really want the milk.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.118
Cool mask by the way.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.873
Did your mommy make that for ya?

02:50.004 --> 02:50.796
Look.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.133
Little buddy.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.138
You wanna buy something...

03:00.139 --> 03:02.141
Buy something, but
if not I'm gonna have

03:02.141 --> 03:04.143
to ask you to leave.

03:04.143 --> 03:08.230
I'm not supposed to have
customers in here after 11.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.988
Seriously though,
what's with the mask?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.745
What, you don't talk?

03:23.913 --> 03:25.206
I want some milk.

03:26.665 --> 03:29.084
That the only thing you say?

03:33.172 --> 03:36.175
Look, if you're waiting for
me to do something stupid

03:36.175 --> 03:38.677
so you can get it on camera,

03:38.719 --> 03:42.014
forget about it, it's
not gonna happen.

03:44.642 --> 03:45.559
This is it!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.188
Feast your eyes.

03:57.655 --> 03:58.447
Fuck it.

03:59.782 --> 04:02.076
I'm bored, I'll play along.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.037
What do you want me to do?

04:05.079 --> 04:08.499
What's gonna make
the best video?

04:08.540 --> 04:11.210
You want me to bark like a dog,

04:12.169 --> 04:14.672
or do some kind of weird dance?

04:15.631 --> 04:16.839
Act like I got Tourettes?

04:16.882 --> 04:19.426
Fucking shit, fuck
pussy face ass

04:20.469 --> 04:21.887
cheek dick fuck!

04:25.224 --> 04:26.225
What about...

04:28.227 --> 04:32.314
Crazy straw man, look at all
the straws, straws, straws!

04:39.280 --> 04:40.572
You're welcome.

04:41.907 --> 04:42.908
Show's over.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.080
I think I've been
more than patient

04:48.122 --> 04:52.251
and accommodating, it's
really time for you to go.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.213
I mean it please.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.299
Stop, I'm serious, stop,
would you get that thing

04:58.340 --> 05:00.259
out of my fucking face?

05:02.136 --> 05:04.305
(whimpering)

05:06.724 --> 05:07.725
Please just.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.437
Wait, all right, just,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.105
there's not a lot
in the register,

05:13.147 --> 05:15.065
but you can have
it, all right, just,

05:15.107 --> 05:16.817
I'm gonna get a bag.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.195
I won't call the cops,
I won't tell anybody.

05:20.237 --> 05:24.408
I'll just stay here all night
until the shift is over.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.785
And it's fine, okay, just,

05:26.827 --> 05:29.288
will you say something please?

05:29.288 --> 05:30.122
Please!

05:33.292 --> 05:36.253
You want me to
get on the ground?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.800
You don't have to
do this, okay, just,

05:41.842 --> 05:44.887
you can just go and then
that's it, it's over.

05:44.928 --> 05:45.721
Come on,

05:47.306 --> 05:49.308
you don't have to do, you
don't have to do this,

05:49.308 --> 05:51.685
I haven't seen your face,
I haven't seen your face,

05:51.727 --> 05:54.188
I haven't seen your face,
and the money's right there.

05:54.229 --> 05:58.567
Just please, I have a
family, I have a family.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.194
I have a baby, I have a baby.

06:00.235 --> 06:04.323
My wife (whimpering),
and a baby.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.325
Please, please, please.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.619
(urinating)

06:13.499 --> 06:15.709
(sobbing)

06:16.710 --> 06:20.339
(dramatic classical music)

06:25.677 --> 06:28.013
(laughing)

06:29.640 --> 06:32.476
Give me the fucking thing!

06:32.518 --> 06:34.853
(shouting)

06:52.204 --> 06:54.373
The fuck, what the fuck is this?

06:54.373 --> 06:55.749
Is this a fucking toy?

06:55.791 --> 06:58.460
What is this, a
fucking fake gun?

07:16.395 --> 07:18.397
- Oh shit, holy shit, holy shit,

07:18.439 --> 07:20.065
holy fucking shit.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.201
(laughing)

07:31.243 --> 07:33.829
(chaotic music)

07:57.769 --> 08:00.981
(dysfunctional music)

08:45.192 --> 08:47.653
(gentle music)

08:55.494 --> 08:58.497
(mysterious music)

09:47.546 --> 09:49.047
Holy shit.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.550
(tense music)

10:04.563 --> 10:05.480
Holy shit.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.828
- What we have here
is a perfect example.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.497
And this is exactly why
our forefathers drafted

10:22.539 --> 10:24.374
the Second Amendment, pow!

10:24.416 --> 10:25.584
See this here?

10:25.584 --> 10:26.793
That's what's called
sanity and that's why

10:26.835 --> 10:28.587
I'm sitting pretty at home.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.964
That other guy, he's
pissing his pants

10:31.006 --> 10:34.801
while at the mercy of
some tween cunt rag.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.094
- This shit is nuts.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.429
I don't know if
it's fucking real.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.097
- So scary with your
cool little mask

10:39.139 --> 10:40.599
and your dumb looking gun.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.267
- It's a performance, you
know, it's a performance.

10:42.309 --> 10:46.229
- Fucking shit fuck pussy
face ass cheek dick fuck!

10:46.271 --> 10:47.606
- I don't even know what
to say about all this.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.691
- This dude pissed himself.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.276
- How you gonna pee yourself?

10:51.318 --> 10:54.154
You know there's a camera,
what the fuck, dude?

10:54.196 --> 10:55.822
- I don't know if
it's corporate America

10:55.864 --> 10:57.074
trying to fuck with our brains.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.660
- Vanna and I loved your video.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.952
- She wasn't really
gonna hurt him

11:00.994 --> 11:04.748
but he got so scared
that he peed on himself.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.333
- Who does that to a person?

11:06.375 --> 11:08.210
- I'm really hoping
that was a fake gun.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.712
- I usually, I don't condone
this type of bullshit

11:10.754 --> 11:12.506
but it's just too
good to pass up,

11:12.547 --> 11:13.882
so I gotta see some crazy shit.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.468
- Straws, straws,
straws, straws!

11:16.510 --> 11:18.637
- That was insane.
- I'm the straw man.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.722
I'm the straw man.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.641
- Kudos to that chick.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.976
- You think you're the
only one with this, man

11:25.018 --> 11:26.645
what's up, girl?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.313
- [Man] Take some
money, take some money,

11:28.355 --> 11:31.066
I'm the straw man,
take some money.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.275
(laughing)

11:32.317 --> 11:34.236
- You have a girl
holding you at gunpoint

11:34.277 --> 11:36.613
has more balls than
you do, hombre.

11:36.655 --> 11:40.659
♪ Making people wet their pants

11:40.659 --> 11:42.661
♪ Kiya

11:42.661 --> 11:46.081
(voices speaking at once)

11:54.673 --> 11:57.509
- This is a dramatic
presentation.

12:02.681 --> 12:06.685
- Bonjour you sexy humans
and extra terrestrials.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.604
Burt Waldon here.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.734
I've been seeing way too much
of these attention starved

12:13.775 --> 12:15.777
whore bag on my feed.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.488
I mean what the actual fuck?

12:18.530 --> 12:22.701
Congratulations, Kiya, you've
made some deadbeat townie cry

12:22.701 --> 12:25.620
and piss himself while
bringing joy to the lives

12:25.662 --> 12:28.749
of bumble fuck incest
ridden hillbillies

12:28.790 --> 12:30.500
with your fake gun.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.128
Fake.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.713
Just like you.

12:34.713 --> 12:38.383
You're just another
fame obsessed junkie

12:38.425 --> 12:40.719
trying to make the
biggest splash you can

12:40.719 --> 12:44.890
before you shit out a
kid and die of cancer.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.726
Here's the cold
hard truth, Kiya.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.104
You're just as insignificant now

12:51.146 --> 12:53.523
as you were yesterday as
you will be in a week.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.484
You're a nobody, nobody.

12:55.525 --> 12:59.112
Everything about you
is fabricated because
you're garbage.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.739
You're absolute garbage.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.493
Putrid, grotesque,
and plague inducing.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.745
Here's my advice to you.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.956
Do us all a favor
and slit your wrist.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.506
We're all running out
of clean water and oil.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.759
Be the bigger person here

13:21.718 --> 13:23.762
and remember go vertical.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.900
- [Man] Once cancer
cells appear,

13:36.942 --> 13:40.320
they soon develop
into a clump of tissue

13:40.362 --> 13:44.074
that lives at the expense
of the entire body.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.598
(mysterious music)

14:29.160 --> 14:31.496
(rustling)

14:38.378 --> 14:40.714
(rustling)

15:01.109 --> 15:02.485
- Turn that off.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.494
- [Kiya] Huh?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.747
- I don't want that on me.

15:15.874 --> 15:16.875
- [Kiya] Why?

15:20.754 --> 15:23.214
- If you don't turn that off...

15:32.307 --> 15:34.100
You're not being safe.

15:46.571 --> 15:50.784
- If I stop recording, will
you get pancakes with me?

16:00.919 --> 16:03.922
(mysterious music)

17:08.319 --> 17:10.946
(tense music)

18:22.060 --> 18:24.687
(bell dinging)

18:34.531 --> 18:36.866
(slurping)

18:52.090 --> 18:53.091
Hi.

18:53.091 --> 18:53.925
- Hi.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.847
- Tell me a story.

19:00.014 --> 19:00.765
- Story?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.767
- Yeah, tell me a story.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.104
- All right.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.110
This one time,

19:13.903 --> 19:17.907
I don't know, I think
that one's kind of boring.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.122
Can we just, I'd
rather just sit here.

19:25.999 --> 19:26.791
- Nope.

19:30.211 --> 19:34.424
Actually first, if you
could be any kind of animal,

19:35.758 --> 19:38.428
what kind of animal
would you be?

19:41.931 --> 19:42.724
- Like a?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.312
Maybe something in the water.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.355
Something big.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.027
And just floating around.

19:55.153 --> 19:58.114
Like maybe one of
those big things,

19:59.407 --> 20:01.409
they swallow everything.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.163
It has fish on its back.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.581
- A whale shark.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.084
That's the biggest
kind of shark.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.587
Do you think you'd
be a whale shark?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.172
- I wouldn't mind.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.968
- Okay tell me a story.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.471
I like your beard.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.265
Now tell me your story.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.852
- If I tell you a story...

20:36.694 --> 20:38.488
Can we just eat after?

20:39.781 --> 20:40.949
- Yeah.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.992
- Give me a second here.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.206
- Okay I have to pee,
so you think on it.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.916
Think on it real hard,
think of your best story

20:49.958 --> 20:51.542
and then I'll come
back and I'll sit here

20:51.584 --> 20:54.545
and I'll drink this
coffee and I'll listen.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.589
I'm really good at that.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.462
(ominous music)

22:11.998 --> 22:14.917
(mysterious music)

24:12.785 --> 24:16.998
(waves crashing)
(seagulls culling)

24:42.064 --> 24:44.442
(baby crying)

24:56.787 --> 24:59.624
(soft music)

24:59.665 --> 25:02.460
(phone ringing)

25:07.924 --> 25:09.467
- [Marshall] Yeah, front desk.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.844
- Do you remember me?

25:11.886 --> 25:14.472
- [Marshall] What do you mean?

25:14.472 --> 25:17.934
- I checked in a
couple of hours ago.

25:17.975 --> 25:20.478
Do you remember
what I look like?

25:20.520 --> 25:25.483
- [Marshall] Real pretty,
young face, yeah I remember.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.443
- How young?

25:27.485 --> 25:29.529
- [Marshall] Not too young.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.490
- Are you sure?

25:34.075 --> 25:35.493
- [Marshall] Um.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.496
- Do you want to fuck me?

25:50.132 --> 25:51.509
Okay, okay, okay.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.252
(mysterious music)

26:37.054 --> 26:39.849
(buttons beeping)

26:46.230 --> 26:48.816
(phone ringing)

27:07.585 --> 27:10.588
(knocking on door)

27:53.506 --> 27:55.299
- Can I see your face?

28:00.471 --> 28:01.263
- No.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.435
- I can live with that.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.608
What's going on with
all the plastic?

28:17.780 --> 28:19.865
- In case we make a mess.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.960
- Who's that little guy?

28:34.672 --> 28:37.007
- [Kiya] He doesn't have a name.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.510
- What's the raw deal?

28:39.552 --> 28:41.929
- Why did you come to my room?

28:43.681 --> 28:45.391
- I don't know,

28:45.433 --> 28:46.225
I guess I

28:49.687 --> 28:53.190

that later, I don't know.

They've been there
for some time.

51:14.739 --> 51:16.824
- [Man] What are we
going to do about them?

51:16.866 --> 51:18.034
- [Man] Who knows?

51:18.034 --> 51:20.703
- [Man] Then they
really are there.

51:20.745 --> 51:23.039
- [Man] I thought you
were convinced of that.

51:23.039 --> 51:24.248
- [Man] I am.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.417
- [Man] We've had
contact with them.

51:26.459 --> 51:28.044
- [Man] Contact, how?

51:28.044 --> 51:29.420
- [Man] Radio.

51:29.462 --> 51:30.963
- [Man] They speak our language?

51:31.005 --> 51:32.465
- [Man] Well not quite.

51:32.507 --> 51:35.051
We receive messages
from their spaceships.

51:35.051 --> 51:38.805
For awhile it came in as
just a lot of jumbled noise.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.640
- [Man] And now sir?

51:40.681 --> 51:43.059
- [Man] Well since they
first tried contact with us

51:43.059 --> 51:46.145
by radio, we've developed
a language computer.

51:46.187 --> 51:50.399
A machine that breaks down
any language to our own.

51:54.070 --> 51:57.073
(mysterious music)

51:58.157 --> 51:59.075
- Hey.

52:05.081 --> 52:07.083
What's with your room?

52:09.752 --> 52:11.420
- [Marshall] My room?

52:12.630 --> 52:15.424
- Swirling vortex
in your ceiling.

52:18.594 --> 52:19.929
- I don't know.

52:25.685 --> 52:27.145
I just stare at it.

52:34.110 --> 52:36.112
Passes the time I guess.

52:50.710 --> 52:52.587
- Are you scared of me?

52:58.342 --> 52:59.135
- Shit.

53:01.846 --> 53:05.975
You might be the best thing
that ever happened to me.

53:10.229 --> 53:11.439
See, he knows.

53:13.191 --> 53:16.194
(breathing heavily)

54:16.295 --> 54:20.508
(bizarre music)
(static humming)

54:37.358 --> 54:41.654
- Okay Sally G says,
OMG, a rainbow done pool

54:41.696 --> 54:43.864
out of his mouth.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.741
You should attach
a GoPro to a dildo

54:45.783 --> 54:47.576
and ram it up his ass.

54:48.828 --> 54:50.496
- What's a GoPro?

54:50.538 --> 54:52.832
- It's a little camera.

54:52.873 --> 54:55.710
- Sally G says to
attach a little camera

54:55.751 --> 54:57.878
to a dildo and
shove it up my ass?

54:57.920 --> 54:59.839
- Sure sounds that way.

55:02.341 --> 55:04.719
(laughing)

55:04.760 --> 55:06.262
- How big's a GoPro?

55:06.262 --> 55:07.263
- It's tiny.

55:07.263 --> 55:09.098
- Well like how big?

55:13.269 --> 55:15.479
Fuck Sally G, what's next?

55:17.565 --> 55:21.902
- Tim Tim, Tim Tim says, he
looks like a piece of shit,

55:21.944 --> 55:23.279
he probably has AIDS.

55:23.279 --> 55:25.781
You should gut him and
toss him in the river.

55:25.823 --> 55:28.159
Wear rubber gloves, faggot.

55:29.285 --> 55:31.537
- You know what, fuck Tim Tim.

55:31.579 --> 55:33.873
He's got two first names.

55:33.914 --> 55:36.208
(laughing)

55:43.299 --> 55:44.925
- You know a lot of
people are saying

55:44.967 --> 55:46.427
I should shoot you.

56:10.785 --> 56:12.578
- You won't shoot him.

56:15.331 --> 56:16.874
- [Marshall] What?

56:17.666 --> 56:19.585
- This ends right here.

56:23.255 --> 56:24.048
- Burt.

56:25.424 --> 56:26.342
- Who?

56:27.343 --> 56:28.344
- Shoot him.

56:34.809 --> 56:36.519
- Answer me honestly.

56:38.187 --> 56:39.688
If you weren't you.

56:42.358 --> 56:45.236
Would you want to
see me shoot you?

56:54.120 --> 56:55.371
I can't ask you.

56:57.331 --> 57:01.836
You're the guy being shot, of
course you're gonna say no.

57:01.877 --> 57:04.380
- You shoot me, you're fucked.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.304
(shouts)

57:13.722 --> 57:15.766
They're gonna lock
your ass up forever.

57:15.808 --> 57:17.393
Just go home.

57:17.393 --> 57:21.355
They'll give you community
service and a book deal.

57:21.397 --> 57:22.565
- You think so?

57:22.606 --> 57:24.900
- Yeah, you haven't
done anything

57:24.942 --> 57:27.528
that a pretty girl
can't get away with.

57:27.570 --> 57:30.573
Cash out while you still
have the chance to.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.324
It's for the view.

57:32.366 --> 57:34.410
- What if there's more to see?

57:34.410 --> 57:37.246
(gun cocking)

57:37.288 --> 57:38.873
Okay, are you ready?

57:41.417 --> 57:42.251
- Go.

57:45.087 --> 57:45.838
Go!

57:45.880 --> 57:48.424
(tense music)

57:50.217 --> 57:51.010
- Bang.

57:52.428 --> 57:56.557
(gun firing)
(screaming)

57:58.517 --> 57:59.435
Marshall.

58:01.437 --> 58:02.396
I missed.

58:03.439 --> 58:05.608
(laughing)

58:07.401 --> 58:09.111
Okay, okay.
- Oh shit.

58:12.072 --> 58:13.449
- Okay, stay still.

58:13.449 --> 58:16.452
- Wait.
(gun firing)

58:23.501 --> 58:25.920
(screaming)

58:28.005 --> 58:28.923
- Marshall.

58:30.424 --> 58:31.717
- God!
- Marshall.

58:33.052 --> 58:36.055
(Marshall groaning)

58:39.141 --> 58:40.601
I forgot to record.

58:48.108 --> 58:49.568
You're doing great.

58:59.495 --> 59:02.248
(gun firing)

59:02.289 --> 59:05.209
(breathing heavily)

59:06.418 --> 59:08.754
(groaning)

59:08.796 --> 59:09.588
Marshall.

59:11.006 --> 59:12.675
Marshall, talk to me.

59:12.716 --> 59:13.509
- I can't.

59:15.010 --> 59:16.136
I feel weird.

59:16.178 --> 59:17.429
- You have to, you have to,

59:17.471 --> 59:19.848
you're gonna pass
out, talk to me.

59:19.890 --> 59:22.601
- [Marshall] Something...

59:22.643 --> 59:23.519
Feel.

59:25.312 --> 59:27.022
- Don't touch it,
stop touching it,

59:27.064 --> 59:28.482
you're gonna make it worse.

59:28.524 --> 59:31.819
- [Marshall] Shit. (groans)

59:31.860 --> 59:34.488
Jesus, pushing,
something's pushing.

59:34.530 --> 59:37.449
I feel like my arm
is giving birth.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.159
- [Kiya] Marshall,
you're bleeding, okay?

59:39.201 --> 59:41.245
We're gonna fix it, nothing
is coming out of your arm.

59:41.287 --> 59:44.206
We need to think
positive thoughts.

59:45.249 --> 59:46.959
Snow days, hedgehogs,

59:47.835 --> 59:49.336
coming.
- Coming.

59:49.378 --> 59:51.755
- Sushi.
- Coming, I like sushi.

59:51.797 --> 59:53.007
I like sushi.

59:53.048 --> 59:54.383
- Michael Jackson, Froot Loops,

59:54.425 --> 59:56.927
Michael Jackson
eating Froot Loops,

59:56.969 --> 59:59.555
don't touch it,
stop touching it.

59:59.555 --> 01:00:02.016
- [Marshall] There's an
eel coming out of my arm!

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:03.559
- [Kiya] What?

01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:04.560
- [Marshall] There's an
eel coming out of my arm.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.603
- [Kiya] That's impossible,

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.187
there's no fucking eel
coming out of your arm.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.773
- [Marshall] (groans) I
can feel it, I can feel it,

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.066
I can see it.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.568
- [Kiya] Marshall,
it's not an eel.

01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:15.404
(groaning)

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:17.781
Oh my god, it's a fucking eel,

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:21.619
you have a fucking eel
coming out of your arm!

01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:26.582
It is, it is, let
it out, let it out!

01:00:26.582 --> 01:00:27.875
- [Marshall] It's
going, it's going!

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.043
- [Kiya] Is it going?

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.503
(screaming)

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.470
- Unfortunately in
life, there are times

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:42.598
when someone receives
such a significant injury

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:45.142
that a tourniquet may
have to be applied.

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.394
Hello, I'm Captain Jim Johnson

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:50.648
and today I'm gonna show you
how to apply a tourniquet.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.817
So Lisa here appears to
be in quite a bit of pain

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.612
and I can see that there's
bleeding from the arm.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:59.615
So real quick, I wanna do
a head to toe assessment

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:03.410
to see if there are any
more serious wounds.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:12.795
So Lisa, are you
experiencing any pain

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.631
aside from the
wound in your arm?

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:23.263
Everything is gonna
be okay, Lisa.

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:26.642
We're gonna get you help and
we're gonna stop the bleeding.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:30.771
Take a wide bandage or some
other type of cloth material

01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:33.232
and place it right
above the wound.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.067
Make an overhand knot,

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.319
make it tight.

01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:40.989
Next place a pen over that knot

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:45.077
with another overhand knot.

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:50.916
Tight.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:56.672
Next, rotate that pen

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.886
until the bleeding stops.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.683
Just know that
applying a tourniquet

01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:12.479
is a last resort and may
result in Lisa losing her arm.

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:16.692
Congratulations you may have
just saved someone's life.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:24.700
- [Kiya] Okay, I think we're
in tourniquet territory.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.702
- [Marshall] Good god.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.706
- You are losing a lot of blood.

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:31.707
- No shit.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.918
I'm gonna end up with
a stub for an arm

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.628
if I'm lucky.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.589
Listen, get me a
god damn tourniquet

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.716
and bring me to a hospital.

01:02:42.718 --> 01:02:43.844
- Are you experiencing
any other pain

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:44.803
besides the bullet wound?

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.722
- Fuck you, fuck you.

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:48.140
Listen, I'm gonna
die in this tub

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.934
if you don't get
your shit together.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:51.769
Oh shit.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.733
Things are getting
really narrow.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.943
- Look, you are
not going to die.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:02.738
I am not taking
you to a hospital.

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:10.746
- Just drop me off and go.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:17.169
(mysterious music)

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.219
- Marshall.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.305
Marshall, Marshie!

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:29.681
Marshall, shit!

01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:32.267
Marshall, Marshall.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:34.061
Shit!

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:36.814
Marshall.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.776
(gurgling)

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.999
(static humming)

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.940
- What did I tell you?

01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:21.984
97 cents in a paper bag.

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:29.825
- Tell me a story.

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:44.506
Come on.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.764
- You're a little shit.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:58.770
- You got one?

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.942
- I guess.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:07.738
- I'm excited.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.248
- Well don't get your hopes up.

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.131
It was like, um, five years ago.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:32.888
Everybody was waiting
for the storm to hit.

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:40.896
I thought I had enough time to

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.273
board up my motel

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:44.900
so I left my house

01:05:49.738 --> 01:05:51.740
and I left my kid there.

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:54.910
Well it turns out,

01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:58.914
the storm rolled
in early and I...

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:08.924
I got stuck in the
flood and I couldn't get

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:10.092
back in time.

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.974
The whole town was under water.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:21.728
The house got hit pretty bad.

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:26.817
Lift the whole roof up.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:30.779
(static drowning out Marshall)

01:06:46.962 --> 01:06:49.840
It was the worst
thing I ever did.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.097
She...

01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:00.976
She's probably your age now.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:06.356
I don't know, have you even
graduated high school yet?

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:16.908
- [Kiya] Have you
ever done this before?

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:25.000
- [Marshall] I can't see you.

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:31.465
- It's...

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:34.468
It's...

01:07:43.769 --> 01:07:45.562
- [Marshall] Hey, hey.

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:47.981
Hey Kiya.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:51.777
Kiya.

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:54.654
- Huh?

01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:01.953
- [Marshall] Do
you hear traffic?

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:04.790
- A little.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:11.088
- [Marshall] Do you think
the front door's open.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.053
Where's the rat?

01:08:22.057 --> 01:08:22.933
- Oh no.

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:26.103
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:27.770
- [Marshall] What?

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.066
- I think he ran.
- He ran?

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.488
Well go get him.

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:40.742
(bell tolling)

01:09:14.568 --> 01:09:15.569
- I got him.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.689
- Hey, just so you know,

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:56.151
I could've fucked you.

01:10:24.179 --> 01:10:26.681
(soft music)

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.208
(phone ringing)

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.228
(siren wailing)

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:29.911
(gentle music)

01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:23.965
(somber classical music)

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:04.339
- [Burt] You're just
another fame obsessed junkie

01:13:04.339 --> 01:13:06.341
trying to make the
biggest splash you can

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:10.095
before you shit out a
kid and die of cancer.

01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:01.396
(doorbell rings)

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:03.333
(Burt shouts)

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.477
(laughing)

01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:50.004
(grunting)

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:16.781
(breathing heavily)

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:26.624
(gagging)

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:29.002
(coughing)

01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:32.690
(seagull culling)

01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:07.493
(eerie ominous music)
