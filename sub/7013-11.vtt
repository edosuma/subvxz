00:06.705 --> 00:10.574
Why would <i>Sports Illustrated</i> even publish
an issue that's not a swimsuit issue?

00:12.045 --> 00:14.843
You know who should
do a swimsuit issue? <i>Playboy.</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:19.074
Why would you put
clothes on a centerfold?

00:19.152 --> 00:21.916
Sometimes I get tired
of all the complete nakedness...

00:21.988 --> 00:24.286
and I like to be teased a little.

00:24.357 --> 00:28.191
Yeah, there's a lot more going on
up here than you know about.

00:28.261 --> 00:32.287
I think there's some stuff going on in there
that you don't know about.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.992
You guys should have come
to the arboretum with us.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.300
We saw plants and trees
from all over the world.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.671
There was a bush from Morocco.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.676
Smelled like chocolate chip cookies.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.611
Ah, that is the perfect bush.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.041
Thanks for taking me
to the arboretum. It was fun.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.144
Yeah, what a great day.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.782
What a <i>horrible</i> day!

01:00.860 --> 01:03.727
I don't mind looking
at some trees, okay?

01:03.797 --> 01:07.597
When they put little signs on them,
with little Latin names-

01:07.667 --> 01:09.760
It makes me want to harm myself.

01:09.836 --> 01:13.363
- So the missus took you out for some girl fun, huh?
- ( Clicks On )

01:13.440 --> 01:17.467
See, Donna is hot, but she is mean.

01:17.544 --> 01:20.638
My girlfriend Nina?
Just hot.

01:20.713 --> 01:24.114
You know, Fez, you talk a lot about this Nina chick,
but none of us have ever seen her.

01:24.184 --> 01:28.052
Yeah, we're actually starting to suspect
that she is some creepy alter-ego...

01:28.121 --> 01:30.589
you visit late at night
in front of the mirror.

01:30.657 --> 01:34.388
Oh, no, I don't do that anymore.

01:34.461 --> 01:37.089
But Nina is the real deal.
Kelso saw her at the D.M.V.

01:37.163 --> 01:39.256
Uh, there were a lot of girls there.

01:39.332 --> 01:44.099
She could have been the one with the lazy eye
that does the vision test.

01:44.170 --> 01:49.574
Lazy-eye Lizzie? No way.
She wouldn't even look at me.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.381
Nina, my friends don't believe that you're
my girlfriend, even though I Frenched you.

02:00.553 --> 02:04.683
Girlfriend? I don't
know if we're there yet.

02:04.757 --> 02:09.558
I mean, I like you and all, it's just that
all the guys at the D.M.V. seem great...

02:09.628 --> 02:13.622
until you find them in your apartment
wearing your hot curlers.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.691
Warren.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.733
I want to get to know you better,
meet your friends...

02:20.807 --> 02:22.968
make sure they're not puppets.

02:23.042 --> 02:27.172
Warren.

02:27.247 --> 02:31.911
So, if they are not puppets,
then would you be my girlfriend?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.579
Mmm, it would definitely help.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.714
- ( Chuckles )
- Are these lines open or not?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.487
- Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
- That was very unprofessional.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.807
Fictional? Does this hickey
look fictional?

03:34.747 --> 03:38.478
Huh, looks too small to be
from the vacuum cleaner, like last time.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.521
Wait, let me see.

03:42.589 --> 03:45.854
Small, blotchy and uneven.
Ah, this girl's an amateur.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.523
Let me see.
Small, blotchy and unpleasant.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.827
Yeah, this girl's a Jackie.

Well, Fez, I am thrilled
that you found a girl...

'cause I was startin' to worry.

But you've proven me and the experts
from <i>Reader's Digest</i> wrong!

04:10.550 --> 04:13.144
When I introduce her to everybody,
I just want it to be special.

04:13.219 --> 04:17.952
Oh! Let's have a formal
dinner party tomorrow.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.219
You know, it was at a dinner
party that I first realized...

04:20.293 --> 04:23.785
Red Forman was more than
just a boy with great hair.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.098
Sounds good, Miss Kitty.

04:27.166 --> 04:31.125
You might be a little past your prime,
but your mind is still sharp.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.973
Oh, actually tomorrow
night's not gonna work...

04:39.045 --> 04:41.013
I thought we might
go see Laser Floyd.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.049
Well, you tell this fellow Floyd
that you have a dinner party.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.679
No, Mom, Laser Floyd's not a guy...

04:47.754 --> 04:51.121
Laser Floyd is Pink Floyd music-
with lasers!

04:52.525 --> 04:55.756
Lasers, like in <i>Star Wars.!</i>

04:55.828 --> 04:58.296
Mrs. Forman, we'll be here.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.628
Wait. You'd rather go
to a formal dinner party?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.964
Sure! Sounds great.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.937
And, uh, don't forget, Mrs. Forman.
You can count Steven and me in.

05:06.005 --> 05:09.805
Yeah, I've been looking for an excuse
to buy him a shirt with buttons.

05:09.876 --> 05:15.371
Since it's a special occasion,
you're all allowed one sip of wine.

05:16.883 --> 05:20.910
Great! It'll be like Communion,
but without the fun of church.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.452
So, Steven, you know,
I was thinking of getting you...

05:25.525 --> 05:29.621
a pair of beige corduroys
and maybe a blue blazer for the party.

05:29.696 --> 05:33.325
Oh, don't forget
the matching scarf and gloves.

05:34.901 --> 05:38.393
This way, I'll be nice and toasty
when hell freezes over.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.910
Uh-oh,Jackie. Looks like Steven
doesn't wanna wear his big-boy clothes.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.741
No, I don't wanna go. You should have
asked me before you said I would.

05:51.818 --> 05:56.846
Steven! I am your girlfriend.
I speak for you now!

05:56.923 --> 06:01.883
Well, then, tell yourself I said to bite me,
'cause I'm not going.

06:03.563 --> 06:06.964
Oh, you are <i>so</i> going!
So just bite yourself!.

06:09.836 --> 06:12.396
- <i>( Door Slams )</i>
- Man, do you believe that crap?

06:12.472 --> 06:15.873
Tell me about it. Donna wants to go
to a dinner party, we go to a dinner party.

06:15.942 --> 06:19.002
If she wants to go to the arboretum,
<i>bang,</i> I'm in a room full of trees.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.445
God, I hate trees.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.542
So tall and arrogant.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.746
So why don't you just not go?

06:28.821 --> 06:32.348
- Oh, it's just one day.
- Not for you, man. You're engaged.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.121
It's Latin for ''screwed for life.''

06:36.129 --> 06:39.064
Oh, my God, you're right.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.123
And I have no choice.
I have to do what she says...

06:41.200 --> 06:43.395
or she won't let me
touch her naughty places.

06:44.937 --> 06:48.134
- Hyde, this is extortion!
- You're tellin' me?

06:48.207 --> 06:51.665
I'm bein' shaken down by a 95-pound brunette
with pink toenails.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.410
Kitty? I know this change of life
has upset you...

06:58.484 --> 07:01.578
but we just bought wine
the other day.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.986
What are you doing,
brushin' your teeth with the stuff?

07:06.058 --> 07:08.583
Red, it's not for me.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.788
Well, this one is.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.899
We're having a dinner
party tomorrow night.

07:15.968 --> 07:20.302
No, can't do it.
<i>Battle of the Network Stars</i> is on!

07:22.041 --> 07:26.944
See, once a year, they make
TV stars compete at things they're not good at.

07:27.013 --> 07:30.915
I look forward all season
to watching Ed Asner try to paddle a canoe.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.953
Makes me feel superior.

07:36.022 --> 07:40.186
Well, you shouldn't feel superior,
because you know what I know about Ed Asner?

07:40.259 --> 07:44.218
Ed Asner would come to my dinner party,
'cause he knows how to treat a woman.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.755
Did you say ''dinner party''?
( Chuckles )

07:47.834 --> 07:50.769
See, I thought you-
Oh, screw it, I'll be there.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.836
What's this about a party?

07:55.908 --> 08:00.709
Oh, well, we're having a party
tomorrow night for Fez and Nina.

08:02.215 --> 08:06.515
- I invited all the kids.
- I'm a kid.

08:06.586 --> 08:10.545
Well, it's for couples only.
You can come if you bring a date.

08:10.623 --> 08:13.524
Well, it's too late
to find a date. I mean-

08:13.593 --> 08:16.255
Yeah, I'm sweet looking,
but I'm no miracle worker.

08:19.165 --> 08:23.295
Well, maybe if you stop jumping
from girl to girl, you wouldn't be alone.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.633
You're no Frank Sinatra, you know!

08:27.707 --> 08:31.507
You know, you used to be nice,
but you've changed, lady!

08:39.552 --> 08:41.679
Guys, I really want
Nina to like me...

08:41.754 --> 08:44.587
so please, avoid
the following topics:

08:47.193 --> 08:51.527
my addiction to candy...

08:51.597 --> 08:54.327
the fact that I have needs...

08:56.068 --> 08:59.435
and my use of Alberto
VO5 Hot Oil Treatment.

09:02.241 --> 09:05.608
Wait. Fez, what does she care
what you use on your hair?

09:05.678 --> 09:07.703
Oh, I do not use it on my hair.

09:11.384 --> 09:16.014
Well, heard about your
secret couples party.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.579
And I'm glad I'm not goin',
'cause I hate parties.

09:18.658 --> 09:21.491
Hey, man, I'm only goin'
'cause Donna's makin' me.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.495
At this rate, the only way
I'll see Laser Floyd is...

09:23.563 --> 09:26.361
if they project it on a leaf
canopy at the arboretum.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.331
So, don't go to the party.
Act tough, Forman.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.167
- I'm not tough.
- That's why I said ''act.''

09:34.907 --> 09:36.841
No one's making me go,
that's for sure.

09:36.909 --> 09:42.347
Oh, that is it, Steven. As your girlfriend,
I am ordering you to go to this party.

09:42.415 --> 09:48.012
And as your boyfriend, I'm ordering you to
take your bossy mouth and flap it elsewhere.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.954
If you flap it at me,
I'll go with you.

09:53.025 --> 09:57.689
You hear that, Steven?
Michael wants to go to the party with me.

09:57.763 --> 10:01.221
- I'm not going to the party.
- Fine.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.393
Michael, I would love
to go to the party with you.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.835
Kick-ass!
I love parties!

10:16.175 --> 10:18.905
Okay, now.
These are called...

10:18.978 --> 10:22.311
after-dinner conversation cards.

10:22.381 --> 10:24.713
Let's try one!
( Laughs )

10:26.885 --> 10:29.854
''If you were a bird,
where would you fly?'' Donna?

10:31.323 --> 10:34.349
Um, south?

10:36.562 --> 10:39.656
I don't know, I'm nervous.
I feel like I'm on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

10:41.000 --> 10:44.561
If I were a bird,
I'd fly to Laser Floyd.

10:44.636 --> 10:48.800
I'd fly to Tahiti,
'cause the girls there don't wear tops!

10:50.542 --> 10:52.942
Wait, but then I'd want
to change back to myself...

10:53.012 --> 10:55.572
because no lady wants
to make it with a bird.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.847
Wait, can I be a monkey?

11:04.957 --> 11:08.188
Okay. Nina!

11:08.260 --> 11:12.162
I'd fly to my favorite place,
the D.M.V.!

11:14.967 --> 11:17.663
I was just going to say that!

11:19.304 --> 11:22.705
Red, we haven't
heard a peep out of you.

11:22.775 --> 11:25.972
If I was a bird,
I'd fly into a ceiling fan.

11:34.019 --> 11:37.887
( Gasps ) Steven, you came,
just like I thought you would.

11:37.956 --> 11:40.356
- You buckled!
- No, I got hungry.

11:40.426 --> 11:42.917
You're in my seat.

11:45.764 --> 11:48.631
Damn, Hyde, now everyone
knows it's a clip-on!

11:53.405 --> 11:56.806
Since you two work at the D.M.V....

11:56.875 --> 11:59.901
how about you make this
parking ticket disappear?

12:01.447 --> 12:04.177
We can't fix this.
You parked in a fire lane.

12:04.249 --> 12:07.082
Oh, Nina, please.
( Laughing )

12:07.152 --> 12:11.248
We're his guests.
I will take care of it, little buddy.

12:12.891 --> 12:15.359
- No, Fez, he broke the law.
- Broke the law?

12:15.427 --> 12:19.124
- I was just getting some milk.
- What if there was a fire?

12:20.466 --> 12:22.900
Then I'd pour my milk on it.

12:25.704 --> 12:30.573
Okay. Okay, let's try another card.

12:30.642 --> 12:35.272
Um, ''If you could
be anyone's shoe...

12:35.347 --> 12:37.872
whose shoe would you be?''

12:37.950 --> 12:42.148
I wouldn't want to be Red's shoe,
'cause I think it's about to go in someone's ass.

12:44.056 --> 12:48.755
That's it! I'm watching
<i>Battle of the Network Stars.</i>

12:48.827 --> 12:52.490
I'm with you.
Have fun with Mr. Clip-on.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.498
Yeah, you know what?
Me too.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.263
- You're leaving?
- There are lasers going off right now!

12:58.337 --> 13:03.297
Perfectly synchronized lasers! And all of a sudden,
you're, like- like, Lady Dinner Rolls...

with her naughty places!

13:06.845 --> 13:08.779
I'm going too.
Apparently...

13:08.847 --> 13:10.974
we can eat a man's food,
but we cannot fix his ticket!

13:13.819 --> 13:16.447
Well, what happened
to my dinner party?

13:16.522 --> 13:19.889
I'm sorry, Mrs. Forman, but Marilu Henner
only gets on the trampoline once a year...

13:19.958 --> 13:22.222
and I'm not gonna miss it.

13:27.866 --> 13:31.597
Where the hell does Eric get off
acting like I make him do stuff?

13:31.670 --> 13:34.696
It not like I wanted us to come
to this dinner party either!

13:34.773 --> 13:37.071
I only did because...

13:37.142 --> 13:39.201
well, you're all menopause-y
now, and you scare me!

13:39.278 --> 13:41.712
Right, you came for me.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.806
Just like I slaved over
a pot roast for all of you.

13:44.883 --> 13:46.908
You want a definition of Hell?

13:46.985 --> 13:50.887

13:50.956 --> 13:54.119

13:54.193 --> 13:56.718
And you know why?
It's right there in front of us, girls.

13:56.795 --> 14:00.424
- Women are giving.
- I'm not giving!

14:01.433 --> 14:03.367
I'm here for me.

14:03.435 --> 14:05.699
Steven is the one who should
think about others.

14:05.771 --> 14:08.205
- I mean, how could he just ditch me?
- Well,Jackie...

14:08.273 --> 14:10.605
it might have to do with
trying to boss him around...

14:10.676 --> 14:14.407
- then showing up with Kelso.
- She's right.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.413
I know she's right.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.915
But you're not a part of the group,
and I don't like you, so zip it!

14:21.186 --> 14:23.211
( Cheering On TV)

14:23.288 --> 14:28.385
Man, look at you guys, all forced to hide
in the basement because of your women.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.121
<i>( Eric )</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

14:30.195 --> 14:33.756
I'm not hiding from anyone.
I finally set Donna straight.

14:33.832 --> 14:37.393
Alls you did was babble about
lasers and naughty places.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.100
Man, I thought
you were having a stroke.

14:41.173 --> 14:45.075
Whatever, man. You caved
just likeJackie wanted.

14:45.143 --> 14:47.236
I didn't cave.
Just wanted to make sure...

14:47.312 --> 14:49.837
''Don Juan el Tardo'' here
kept his hands off her.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.511
Then how do you explain the necktie?

14:53.585 --> 14:55.883
I just came from a business meeting.

14:57.489 --> 15:03.189
At least he's putting up a fight.
You just gave up. Like France.

15:07.099 --> 15:11.399
Oh, get off his back, little buddy.
You were at the party too.

15:11.470 --> 15:16.669
Hey, I fought the good
fight for 30 years.

15:16.742 --> 15:20.906
Now I just agree with what Kitty
wants to do, so I can go to sleep.

15:24.816 --> 15:27.250
And I'm not your ''little buddy.''

15:28.420 --> 15:33.119
Yeah, you're all doomed.
That's funny.

15:33.191 --> 15:37.560
No, we're not all doomed.
One man here still has a chance.

15:37.629 --> 15:40.689
One man can take
a stand for all of us.

15:40.766 --> 15:42.757
And that man's name is-

15:42.834 --> 15:46.770
Well, we can't pronounce his
real name, so we call him Fez!

15:49.608 --> 15:55.012
I don't want to take a stand, I just want Nina
to be my girlfriend and give me nooky!

15:55.147 --> 15:57.638
Fez, come on.
Give it a try!

15:57.716 --> 16:00.446
It'll be like <i>Battle of the Network Stars.</i>
Think about it.

16:03.488 --> 16:07.390
Welcome back to
the <i>Battle of the Gender Stars...</i>

16:07.459 --> 16:12.089
- where it's the gals with 50 points!
- ( Cheering )

16:12.164 --> 16:15.622
And the guys with zero.

16:16.635 --> 16:18.569
But the guys still have a chance...

16:18.637 --> 16:24.098
'cause the final event is
conveniently worth 51 points.

16:24.176 --> 16:27.475
You guys are pathetic!

16:27.546 --> 16:31.209
Wow, that's some
tough talk,Jamie Farr.

16:31.283 --> 16:35.845
I'm switching to the gals' team. I can do that,
because I wear a dress on <i>M.A.S.H.</i>

16:38.190 --> 16:40.920
Okay, now let's meet
our contestants.

16:40.992 --> 16:45.452
- Representing the gals: the lovely Nina!
- <i>( Women Cheering )</i>

16:45.530 --> 16:48.931
- And representing the guys: the lovely Fez!
- <i>( Eric ) Yes.</i>

16:54.039 --> 16:56.200
Fighters, go!
( Blows Whistle )

16:59.411 --> 17:01.436
( Red )
Make that dame eat some mud!

17:01.513 --> 17:05.381
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
We're going antiquing all weekend!

17:05.450 --> 17:08.214
Oh, like hell we are.

17:11.623 --> 17:14.285
( Cheering )

17:17.095 --> 17:19.222
I hate antiquing.
Let's do this thing!

17:19.297 --> 17:23.700
That's right.
Gentlemen, let's go get our cojones back!

17:26.070 --> 17:28.266
I gotta see this.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.969
- Hey, man, you coming?
- Nah, I still have my cojones.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.982
My lonely, lonely cojones.

17:40.585 --> 17:45.716
Oh, look who it is. You bake a brownie,
and the bastards come running.

17:45.791 --> 17:49.693
I'm afraid your brownies are powerless now.
Fez has something to say. Fez.

17:49.761 --> 17:51.695
- Can I have a brownie?
- Fez!

17:51.763 --> 17:55.699
Oh. Right, right, right, right.

17:55.767 --> 17:59.897
Nina, I insist you take care of Red's ticket,
because I am in charge.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.674
- Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
- Okay. ( Chuckles )

18:04.876 --> 18:08.710
- Man, what the hell?
- I have needs.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.707
Nina, if I do everything you want,
would you be my girlfriend?

18:13.785 --> 18:16.185
Can't say no to that!
( Chuckles )

18:17.355 --> 18:21.815
I cannot believe it!
I have a girlfriend!

18:23.695 --> 18:25.686
So when do we do it?

18:30.602 --> 18:34.060
- I am not speaking to you.
- <i>( Sets Down Dinnerware )</i>

18:35.407 --> 18:38.535
Well, at least it will be
quiet enough to go to sleep.

18:42.681 --> 18:47.243
Okay, Donna, when we came up here,
Fez was supposed to- Donna?

18:49.821 --> 18:52.688
Oh, crap.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.191
Hey, Steven, look.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.024
Remember how you said
that I was bossy?

18:58.096 --> 19:00.223
Well, I think you were right.

19:00.298 --> 19:03.859
So, from now on, if I want you
to do something, I'll ask first.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.665
- Well, I just-
- Shh, I'm talking!

19:06.738 --> 19:11.698
( Gasps )
I am so sorry. There I go again.

19:13.211 --> 19:16.044
Okay, here's
what I wanted to say:

19:16.114 --> 19:19.880
Would you like to go with me
to the Girl Scout Alumni Pancake Breakfast?

19:23.922 --> 19:28.154
Jackie, I'd rather put on a dress and slow dance
with Kelso on <i>Soul Train.</i>

19:31.963 --> 19:34.022
But since you asked nicely, I'll go.

19:34.099 --> 19:37.193
Yea! Oh, uh, Steven, don't
forget to bring a spatula...

19:37.269 --> 19:39.203
because I signed you up
as a flipper.

19:41.640 --> 19:46.100
Hey, the flipper better be the guy
who judges the Alumni Bikini Contest!

19:47.812 --> 19:50.110
It's not.

19:50.181 --> 19:52.547
- Donna-
- Wait, let me guess.

19:52.617 --> 19:55.177
- <i>( Door Closes )</i>
- Laser Floyd, Laser Floyd...

19:55.253 --> 19:58.086
arboretum, dinner roll, Laser Floyd.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.125
- Okay, listen.
- No, you listen.

20:01.192 --> 20:03.126
I don't know
what's wrong with you-

20:03.194 --> 20:07.358
if it's genetic, or if you took a pill
from your mother's cabinet-

20:07.432 --> 20:11.630
But I'm through doing stuff for you,
because you don't appreciate it.

20:11.703 --> 20:15.901
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You're doing stuff for <i>me?</i>

20:15.974 --> 20:18.340
Yeah!

20:18.410 --> 20:20.776
I went to that dinner party
to make your mother happy...

20:20.845 --> 20:23.040
and I went to the arboretum
because you wanted to.

20:26.318 --> 20:30.880
I wanted to? All I said was,
''Look, the arboretum.''

20:30.956 --> 20:36.053
W- It sounded like you wanted to go.
I hate trees!

20:37.395 --> 20:40.296
I mean, ''Ooh, show me trees!''
Does that sound like me?

20:44.135 --> 20:48.162
- No. Look, I'm sorry.
- ( Sighs )

20:48.239 --> 20:52.198
I just- I thought you were gonna
make me do girlie crap...

20:52.277 --> 20:54.472
for the rest of my life.

20:54.546 --> 20:58.004
Eric, come on. You know me
way better than that.

20:58.083 --> 21:02.110
Yeah, you're right.

21:02.187 --> 21:06.681
So, would you like to go see
Laser Floyd next weekend?

21:06.758 --> 21:10.023
Oh, we can't. I signed us up for this class:
''Quilting for Couples.''

21:12.697 --> 21:14.892
( Laughing )

21:17.135 --> 21:19.365
- ( Chuckling ) I'm kidding!
- ( Gasps )

21:19.437 --> 21:21.428
It's just for men.

21:29.314 --> 21:32.283
And the canoeing champion
for this year's...

21:32.350 --> 21:36.480
<i>Battle of the Network Stars</i>
is... Red Forman!

21:37.756 --> 21:41.886
- My team!
- Thanks,Jamie Farr.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.724
And I'd like to give
a special thanks to Ed Asner.

21:44.796 --> 21:48.254
Ed, thanks for paddling
your canoe like a girl.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.894
Where's your spunk now,
you big pansy? ( Laughing )

21:52.305 --> 21:58.432
