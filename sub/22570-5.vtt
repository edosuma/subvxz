WEBVTT

00:05.433 --> 00:07.533
They're in that same spot again.

00:09.567 --> 00:11.633
They've definitely
found something.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.067
There's something going on.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.733
Is it ready?

00:17.767 --> 00:19.700
Light's on.

00:19.733 --> 00:22.367
All right. Give me the control.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.533
(Whirring)

00:25.567 --> 00:28.500
All right. Gently does it.

00:28.533 --> 00:32.500
I'm lifting off
in a three, two, one.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.733
Up she goes.

00:44.133 --> 00:47.133
How do you make it steady?
Stop it going up.

00:47.167 --> 00:49.200
Just let go of the joystick.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.767
Still going up?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.333
Yep. Just try flicking it down.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.133
(Click)

00:57.867 --> 00:59.667
Still going up, is it?

00:59.700 --> 01:02.567
Yep.
Yeah, that's really high now.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.132
How high is it supposed to go?

01:04.167 --> 01:06.533
Well, how am I supposed
to know? It's not responding.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.267
How do you make it come down?

01:08.300 --> 01:10.133
Here, let me see.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.667
- Can you see it?
- Only just.

01:15.667 --> 01:18.800
No. No, I'm losing it.
It's gone.

01:18.833 --> 01:20.433
No. No, yeah, yeah, there!

01:20.467 --> 01:22.433
No.

01:23.533 --> 01:25.400
No, I can't see it.

01:27.467 --> 01:29.033
(Sighs)

01:29.067 --> 01:32.700
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

01:32.733 --> 01:35.600
So that's it, is it? It just
keeps going until it's in orbit?

01:37.433 --> 01:39.233
(Exhales)

01:39.267 --> 01:40.767
How long do the batteries last?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.367
20 minutes.

01:44.767 --> 01:47.033
I thought you said
you could fly these things?

01:47.067 --> 01:48.200
I never said that.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.100
Well, why did you keep
letting it go up?

01:50.133 --> 01:52.233
I tried everything.
It just wasn't responding.

01:52.267 --> 01:53.833
It just kept going up and up.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.733
You can tell that to the
insurance company.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.033
Why me?

01:57.067 --> 02:00.633
Because, Paul, you're the one
that said he could fly these.

02:00.667 --> 02:02.600
- (Crashing thud)
BOTH: Whoa!

02:12.267 --> 02:17.133
* Will you search
the lonely earth for me?

02:17.167 --> 02:21.700
* Climb through the briar
and bramble?

02:21.733 --> 02:25.700
* I'll be your treasure

02:26.833 --> 02:30.067
* I'm waiting for you

02:31.433 --> 02:35.367
* I'm waiting for you

02:39.200 --> 02:40.700
See QI this week?

02:40.733 --> 02:42.000
Yeah.

02:42.033 --> 02:46.267
Never thought I'd say this, but
I think I prefer Toksvig to Fry.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.100
Controversial.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.833
Oh, don't you think
she's better?

02:49.867 --> 02:52.533
I'm not prepared to stick
my neck out that far, mate.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.700
She's certainly doing
a good job.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.433
Big shoes to fill, literally.

02:58.467 --> 02:59.567
Why literally?

03:01.133 --> 03:03.233
Stephen Fry's got big feet.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.233
Yeah, but she doesn't literally
have to wear his shoes.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.200
Well, actually,
they've got a rule...

03:08.233 --> 03:10.233
Who's this?

03:10.267 --> 03:12.333
- All right?
- Morning.

03:12.367 --> 03:15.067
Metal detectors, are you?

03:15.100 --> 03:16.600
You could say that.

03:16.633 --> 03:19.800
Are you one of them?
One of the solar people.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.667
Tree clearance.
Getting rid of nuisance trees.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.400
That's quite a slogan.

03:24.433 --> 03:26.467
Your life must be
filled with joy.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.200
- Eh?
- Nothing.

03:28.233 --> 03:30.100
Not getting rid of
this one though.

03:30.133 --> 03:33.067
- This one's going, yeah.
- What? Why?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.167
What nuisance
is this one causing?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.367
Shadow.

03:39.167 --> 03:40.267
One small patch?

03:40.300 --> 03:44.433
Yeah, you see the sun,
see, it travels through the sky

03:44.467 --> 03:47.567
and that patch covers
half an acre in a day.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.333
That's a lot of sunlight
all wasted on a tree.

03:51.367 --> 03:52.600
See ya.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.500
That's depressing.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.733
Shouldn't we do something
about it?

04:00.767 --> 04:03.033
Like what? Save the tree?

04:03.067 --> 04:05.100
Well, shouldn't we? I mean...

04:05.133 --> 04:07.267
we don't want the tree
to be cut down.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.767
No.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.700
So we should probably
try and save it.

04:12.067 --> 04:15.167
So how do you save a tree?

04:15.200 --> 04:18.233
Well, traditionally, you chain
yourself to it, don't you?

04:18.267 --> 04:19.800
One of us chains ourself
to the tree

04:19.833 --> 04:22.400
and the other one goes
and gets the press.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.433
Yeah. (Chuckles)

04:24.467 --> 04:26.433
I don't know.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.467
It's...a bit embarrassing.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.433
Huh. Yeah.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.033
(Beeping)

05:00.800 --> 05:02.267
Bat box.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.400
What's that?

05:05.433 --> 05:07.733
Bat box is what we need
to save that tree.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.567
Whack a bat box up there,
bats start roosting.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.500
Boom. They can't touch it.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.533
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.367
It's the same as
Great Crested Newts.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.267
You can have
a muddy puddle essentially

05:18.300 --> 05:20.500
but as soon as one of those
slippery bastards rocks up,

05:20.533 --> 05:23.233
it becomes a Site of Special
Scientific Interest.

05:23.267 --> 05:25.400
Scourge of the developer.

05:25.433 --> 05:29.233
All right, well, you should get
onto that then. Build a bat box.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.667
Yeah. Maybe I will.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.333
Oh, I wish I had a shed.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.233
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, mate. I forgot.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.067
What did you do
with your tools?

05:41.100 --> 05:43.600
Well, they're in crates
in the garage going rusty.

05:46.833 --> 05:50.300
You didn't wipe 'em with an oily
rag before you put 'em away?

05:50.333 --> 05:53.733
Well, yeah, obviously.
I was being dramatic.

05:53.767 --> 05:56.067
Oh. (Laughs)

05:56.100 --> 05:58.833
I see. (Laughs)

05:58.867 --> 06:00.367
What you got?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.333
Carpet stair rod holder.

06:02.367 --> 06:05.233
Yeah.
I've had a couple of them.

06:05.267 --> 06:07.633
Must have been a flight
of stairs here somewhere.

06:31.167 --> 06:33.567
Er...hello? (Knocks)

06:33.600 --> 06:35.000
Toni?

06:37.167 --> 06:38.500
Hi, Kate. What you doing here?

06:38.533 --> 06:41.500
- Which is the front door?
- Come down this end.

06:46.267 --> 06:48.367
Oh, don't I need to say
something?

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
Like, to be invited on board.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.267
You're thinking of vampires.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.167
Oh.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.167
- Ooh!
- Go on.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.800
Thanks.

07:03.367 --> 07:04.767
This place is amazing.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.767
Thanks. It was my grandparents'.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.233
No way.
How long have you lived on it?

07:09.267 --> 07:11.033
About three years.

07:11.067 --> 07:12.467
And it makes my dad heave.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.433
He hasn't even got this far.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.067
He doesn't even like
looking at it from dry land.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.367
(Laughs) You know he's
only ever seen the sea once?

07:19.400 --> 07:20.600
He told me that.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.633
Don't expect beach holidays.

07:22.667 --> 07:26.333
I'm not expecting anything.

07:26.367 --> 07:29.533
I'm gonna move out of my dad's
flat. Find my own place.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.700
Why? He likes you being there.

07:31.733 --> 07:34.433
Yeah, I know.
That's why I've stayed so long.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.367
He's afraid I'm gonna
disappear again,

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
which is why
I haven't told him yet.

07:38.433 --> 07:39.667
So why are you telling me?

07:39.700 --> 07:42.633
I just want you to know that
I won't be around all the time.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.233
I won't be in your way.

07:44.267 --> 07:47.567
You've never been in my way.
That's not fair, Kate.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.533
Don't do anything on my account
because I don't even know

07:50.567 --> 07:52.467
if your dad and I
are still seeing each other.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.233
Please don't break up
with my dad.

07:54.267 --> 07:55.833
- He thinks the world of you.
- Kate.

07:55.867 --> 07:59.267
He let Maggie stay because
he's a kind and decent guy.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.600
Did he send you here?

08:00.633 --> 08:03.033
Yeah. He said,
"Nip down and tell Toni

08:03.067 --> 08:04.567
that I'm a kind
and decent guy."

08:04.600 --> 08:06.433
No, of course not.
I just felt bad

08:06.467 --> 08:09.400
because I let her in the flat.
I didn't know who she was.

08:09.433 --> 08:11.833
Look, Kate, I don't wanna
discuss it with you.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.300
Your dad and I will either
sort it out or we won't,

08:14.333 --> 08:17.600
but I don't need advice or
character references, thanks.

08:17.633 --> 08:20.533
I know he's a decent guy. That's
why I'm going out with him.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.633
- So you've not broken up?
- Shut up, please!

08:22.667 --> 08:24.733
I don't wanna
talk about it with you.

08:24.767 --> 08:27.767
I feel like I'm back at sixth
form talking about boyfriends.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.200
I'm too old for this.

08:29.233 --> 08:32.433
All right. I'll back off.
I've said my bit.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.500
I just worry about him,
you know?

08:34.533 --> 08:36.133
I know.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.100
(Exhales) I love your ship.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.299
It's a boat really.

08:43.332 --> 08:45.500
I love it. I'll see ya.

09:16.733 --> 09:18.633
Steve, can I find
a safe home for this?

09:18.667 --> 09:21.467
What's that, a porcupine?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.833
Porcupine? You serious?
It's a hedgehog.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.167
Thought hedgehogs were flat.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.233
The squashed dead ones
are flat.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.333
The live ones are spherical.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.767
All right, Richard Attenborough.

09:32.567 --> 09:33.733
It's David.

09:33.767 --> 09:37.033
Oh, I'm sorry.
Been calling you Andy.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.700
(Distant chatter)

10:13.667 --> 10:15.367
Grab this, will you, mate?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.800
Sorry, mate. I'm not actually...

10:16.833 --> 10:19.033
Come on! It's killing me.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.667
(Gentle clattering)

11:52.733 --> 11:55.433
- Hello.
- Hey.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.733
What's in the crate?

12:02.333 --> 12:04.533
Please step away
from the crate.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.500
Kate came to see me.
Did she tell you?

12:15.533 --> 12:18.333
To your place? What for?

12:18.367 --> 12:21.500
To tell me what a swell
prince of a guy you are.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.633
Hmm. I'm not that great.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.600
That's what I said.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.733
- She come aboard?
- Yep.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.367
- Did she puke?
- Nope.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.833
- Turn a pallid yellow?
- No.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.500
Not hereditary, then.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.100
The reason I let Maggie stay

12:40.133 --> 12:43.033
was cos I don't have
any feelings for her any more.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.233
I could just treat her
as a guest.

12:45.267 --> 12:49.133
But...with you,
I'd want it to be just us.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.767
OK. That's quite sweet.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.533
Yeah? Shall I go on?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.267
See what happens.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.367
Well, that was it, really.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.700
Kate's got her own room.
She wouldn't disturb us.

13:06.733 --> 13:08.533
Well, that's not it, is it?

13:08.567 --> 13:11.400
I mean, the thing is,
would we disturb her?

13:11.433 --> 13:13.600
Huh?

13:13.633 --> 13:15.700
- You know?
- Not really.

13:15.733 --> 13:19.367
Well, it's...a question
of acoustics.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.033
Acoustics?

13:22.067 --> 13:24.500
Oh, God, you know,
soundproofing.

13:24.533 --> 13:28.267
The thought of...Kate
hearing any goings on.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.567
(Laughs)

13:29.600 --> 13:31.733
Don't laugh.
It's hard enough as it is.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.700
You know what I mean,
it's awkward.

13:33.733 --> 13:35.533
So what are you thinking?
Egg boxes?

13:35.567 --> 13:37.567
I was thinking egg boxes,

13:37.600 --> 13:39.733
cos there's a stack of 'em
in the warehouse.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.633
Big sheets of 'em.

13:44.767 --> 13:46.600
I...I can't tell her to leave.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.067
I just can't do it.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.833
You know what? I think
she might be ready to go,

13:54.867 --> 13:57.300
but she thinks you'll be upset.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.433
- What makes you think that?
- She told me.

14:00.467 --> 14:04.133
She told me she was gonna start
looking for a place of her own.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.300
Where? Here?

14:06.333 --> 14:07.700
Oh, close by. Yeah.

14:07.733 --> 14:10.600
Oh, well, that's...
that's different.

14:10.633 --> 14:13.067
I mean, if...if she wants to.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.733
I just didn't want it
to come from me but...

14:18.400 --> 14:22.100
I...I could help her to look for
a place, if it's around here.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.700
She doesn't have much stuff,
she doesn't need much space.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.500
And then what?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.667
You...you could move in.
If you want.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.033
OK. Do you want?

14:34.267 --> 14:35.667
I do.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.200
I'm not selling my boat though.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.433
You don't have to.

14:38.467 --> 14:41.200
I'll be able to find a tenant,
although it is very small.

14:41.233 --> 14:44.600
Well, look, you know,
let's see if...

14:44.633 --> 14:47.633
Kate can find somewhere
for herself

14:47.667 --> 14:51.767
and then... you could
advertise for a tenant.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.333
That's probably
the obvious thing to do.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.200
Yes. Yes, I think so.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.267
Cheers, Ray.

15:15.567 --> 15:17.333
(Phone vibrates)

15:21.567 --> 15:23.600
Phone!

15:23.633 --> 15:25.467
The thing is,
there's this house.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.400
I found this house and I think
it could be amazing.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.400
(Phone vibrates)

15:30.433 --> 15:31.800
Who's that?

15:31.833 --> 15:33.367
Da-da.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.233
- Hello?
- ..there's this house.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.467
Are you on your way back?
Are you on your way home?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.833
I found this house and I think
it could be amazing.

15:39.867 --> 15:43.033
- Andy?
- I found this amazing place.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.633
- Andy?
- I've found a house.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.667
- I've found a house.
- Let's listen to Daddy

15:47.700 --> 15:50.433
- talking to himself.
- I found this house, Becky.

15:50.467 --> 15:55.500
I've found this...
Becky, I've found a house.

15:55.533 --> 15:59.100
I found this house and I think
it could be within our means.

15:59.133 --> 16:00.400
There's a lot of work
to do on it

16:00.433 --> 16:01.800
but I could do the work myself.

16:01.833 --> 16:04.200
In fact,
I think that's what I wanna do.

16:04.233 --> 16:07.200
The only thing is,
I've quit my job.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.600
I have to tell you at this
point, though, Becky.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.433
Not, "at this point",
that's stupid.

16:11.467 --> 16:15.033
I have to come clean, Becky.
I quit my job.

16:15.067 --> 16:18.100
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.267
- Hello?
- (Over mobile) Hello?

16:25.300 --> 16:27.733
- Anybody home?
- (Over mobile) Anybody home?

16:33.133 --> 16:34.733
- What?
- What?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.533
- Hello?
- Hello?

16:49.367 --> 16:51.700
- Have a nice day?
- Have a nice day?

16:56.067 --> 16:58.800
- And my mum knew?
- Yeah.

17:00.133 --> 17:01.667
That doesn't make it all right.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.200
- Half makes it all right.
- No, it doesn't.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.433
Wait till you see this house -
that will make it all right.

17:06.467 --> 17:08.567
- So tell me what it's like.
- No.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.700
I wanna know
your first impression.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.700
But you have to imagine
what it could be,

17:12.733 --> 17:15.833
so don't look at the holes in
the roof or the broken window.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.032
- So my second impression?
- Yeah, your second impression.

17:19.067 --> 17:21.067
How can we afford a house?

17:21.099 --> 17:22.767
It's an auction
and there's no reserve,

17:22.800 --> 17:25.733
so we just take what we got
and bid what we can afford.

17:25.767 --> 17:28.433
- We haven't got anything.
- We've got some savings.

17:28.467 --> 17:31.467
Andy, we've got ten grand.
That buys a deposit on a flat,

17:31.500 --> 17:34.633
not a three-bedroom cottage
in half an acre of land.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.567
Well, if we don't try
we'll never know.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.767
You're a dreamer.

17:39.800 --> 17:44.133
You may say I'm a dreamer,
but I'm not the only one.

17:44.167 --> 17:46.733
- I hope some day...
- I get it.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.300
Imagine.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.500
Oh, Andy, what have you
fallen in love with?

17:52.533 --> 17:56.100
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I mean, it...it could be.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.633
Who's gonna do the work? You?

17:58.667 --> 18:00.467
- Yeah.
- Single-handed?

18:00.500 --> 18:03.133
Single-handed, baby.
That's what I wanna do.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.667
I'll be a full-time hobbyist.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.633
I'll take Stan to school,
I'll pick him up,

18:06.667 --> 18:09.167
and I'll build us a house
with roses round the door.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.200
I haven't seen you so enthused
since we got back from Africa.

18:12.233 --> 18:14.700
So, what?
You'd give up archaeology?

18:14.733 --> 18:17.233
Yeah. For a couple of years
I would.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.400
And then I'll have time
to fix the shingles,

18:19.433 --> 18:21.233
I'll have time to fix the door.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.333
I'll have time to oil the hinges
and to mend the windows...

18:24.367 --> 18:26.400
Shut up. I get it.
Go and find Stan.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.800
There could be bear traps
or a hidden well.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.700
I'd pay extra
for a hidden well.

19:13.467 --> 19:16.133
Froggy, froggy! Froggy!

19:20.867 --> 19:23.200
So, you been to
an auction before?

19:23.233 --> 19:26.033
No, I but I see 'em every day
on TV.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.533
Homes Under the Hammer,
Property Lottery,

19:28.567 --> 19:30.133
Auctions-Auctions-Auctions.

19:30.167 --> 19:32.633
- You got the Auctions Channel?
- No.

19:34.300 --> 19:37.267
Well, all you need
is confidence.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.733
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

19:38.767 --> 19:42.300
- So, how much cash you got?
- About 12 grand.

19:42.333 --> 19:46.633
Bloody hell. Well, you're gonna
need more than confidence then.

19:46.667 --> 19:50.267
Here, you fancy moving
onto a house boat?

19:50.300 --> 19:53.133
Well, that would be a brilliant
move with a two-year-old.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.833
Toni's looking for a tenant
so she can move in with me.

19:55.867 --> 19:57.267
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.667
So if you hear of anyone looking
for somewhere.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.333
What about Kate?

20:02.367 --> 20:06.533
Good idea. Yeah. I'll ask her
if she knows anyone.

20:08.833 --> 20:13.500
Wait a minute! I've come up with
an even better idea.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.733
- I am a genius.
- Go on.

20:15.767 --> 20:18.233
Kate could move
onto the narrow boat

20:18.267 --> 20:20.400
and they could do
a straight swap.

20:20.433 --> 20:23.100
That is a good idea.
I wish I'd thought of that.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.633
Yeah. Yeah.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.100
She doesn't get seasick
like me,

20:27.133 --> 20:30.367
doesn't have much stuff,
and she loves the boat.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.367
Like I say,
I wish I'd thought of that.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.333
Housing problem fixed.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.400
Looks like I've come up
with the perfect solution.

20:37.433 --> 20:40.600
Couldn't come up with a few
grand for me, could you?

20:40.633 --> 20:44.300
Yeah. We just gotta find it.
A pot of gold.

20:45.367 --> 20:46.700
We've got a week.

20:49.467 --> 20:51.667
Oh, bollocks.

20:51.700 --> 20:55.600
We're too late.
They've...sealed it off.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.400
Damn!

20:58.433 --> 21:00.833
They must have come
some time after we left.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.700
If only we'd got here
before they put this up.

21:03.733 --> 21:06.767
Ah, well. At least we tried.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.300
Hang on.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.000
What?

21:11.667 --> 21:13.433
There's no-one around
for miles.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.267
What you saying?

21:17.300 --> 21:20.067
I don't know. It's just...

21:20.100 --> 21:21.433
Oh, nothing, nothing.

21:21.467 --> 21:25.233
No, go on.
What are you thinking?

21:25.267 --> 21:27.033
I reckon
I could get under that tape.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.767
What...?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.667
I know, you're right.
It's stupid.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.467
No. No, I reckon
you're on to something.

21:46.667 --> 21:49.667
Keep watch.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.267
(Chirps)

22:27.800 --> 22:29.367
Done?

22:38.133 --> 22:40.500
LANCE: Felt good, didn't it,
being an activist.

22:40.533 --> 22:44.067
ANDY: We were like Ninjas,
environmental Ninjas.

22:44.100 --> 22:46.567
Yeah. So, er...
when do the bats turn up?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.300
I don't know. Tonight?

22:49.333 --> 22:51.700
Oh, well, you reckon
they'll move straight in?

22:51.733 --> 22:53.533
I haven't really
thought about it.

22:53.567 --> 22:56.067
I suppose it takes a while
for them to find the boxes.

22:58.167 --> 23:01.133
Oh, here we are, look.
24-hour bat helpline.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.333
Shut up, there isn't.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.767
There bloody is, look.
Bat Action Trust.

23:04.800 --> 23:09.233
After hours our calls are
redirected to bat volunteers.

23:09.267 --> 23:10.767
Do it.

23:15.533 --> 23:17.300
Hello. Er...

23:18.567 --> 23:20.367
I'm on hold.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.100
Busy time.

23:22.133 --> 23:24.533
Oh, it's ringing.

23:24.567 --> 23:26.267
- (Interference buzzing)
- Ah!

23:28.700 --> 23:30.567
Paul, turn your phone off!

23:30.600 --> 23:33.800
- Paul!
- (Phone buzzing)

23:33.833 --> 23:36.700
Can you switch your phone
to aeroplane mode, please?

23:36.733 --> 23:39.100
It's interfering with my Arado.

23:41.767 --> 23:44.567
Hello? 24-hour bat
helpline. How can I help?

23:44.600 --> 23:47.433
Oh, yes. I've got
a bat question for you -

23:47.467 --> 23:49.200
er...a bat query for you.

23:49.233 --> 23:50.733
Oh, I'll certainly
do my best to help.

23:50.767 --> 23:53.700
What's the nature
of your bat enquiry?

23:53.733 --> 23:56.767
Yeah. Well, basically,
we've installed a bat box.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.233
How soon can we expect
the bats to turn up?

23:59.267 --> 24:02.600
Well, ideally you want to plant
some wildflowers

24:02.633 --> 24:05.033
that will attract the insects
and invertebrates

24:05.067 --> 24:06.467
upon which the bats feed.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.100
Or, as we like to say,
provide bed and breakfast.

24:09.133 --> 24:11.533
(Chuckles)
Yeah, bed and breakfast.

24:11.567 --> 24:14.100
Well, we haven't got time
for any of that.

24:14.133 --> 24:16.433
What's the quickest
we could expect them to...

24:16.467 --> 24:18.533
What's the world record?

24:18.567 --> 24:21.100
- Can you hurry up, please?
- It's the bat phone.

24:21.133 --> 24:23.100
Why has it come through to you?

24:23.133 --> 24:25.067
I'm further up the list
than you are.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.833
Yep. Well,
it's entirely possible

24:26.867 --> 24:29.333
the bats may have already
used the tree to roost.

24:29.367 --> 24:32.033
Look, I got a missed call.
It's supposed to be for me.

24:32.067 --> 24:33.600
Let me speak to him.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.033
And where's this tree situated?

24:37.067 --> 24:38.800
Let me speak to him.

24:38.833 --> 24:40.133
But that's...

24:41.700 --> 24:43.133
Hello there.

24:43.167 --> 24:45.433
Bat Action Trust.
24-hour bat helpline.

24:45.467 --> 24:46.800
You're through to Philip Peters.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.767
Sorry about that. A bit of
a mix-up with the switchboard.

24:49.800 --> 24:54.200
You're now through to
a more senior member. Hello?

24:56.533 --> 24:59.567
Hmm, nobody there.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.733
What? No. What?

25:02.767 --> 25:07.067
You're not telling us that
you two are the...the bat man.

25:07.100 --> 25:10.467
Oh, I see.
Another hoax call, is it?

25:10.500 --> 25:11.700
You pull that stunt

25:11.733 --> 25:15.667
with one of the other emergency
services, you get arrested.

25:15.700 --> 25:19.133
- Come on, Paul.
- No.

25:19.167 --> 25:22.567
- Pardon?
- No, Phil. This looks real.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.400
I think these guys
need our help.

25:24.433 --> 25:26.367
Let me see your bat credentials.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.067
It's genuine.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.167
Where's this tree?

25:40.200 --> 25:41.633
Back up there.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.233
- Could be bats there already.
- Yeah?

25:45.267 --> 25:47.600
- Yeah. A good area for bats.
- How do we find out?

25:47.633 --> 25:49.700
I'll have to come back,
bring my detector.

25:52.733 --> 25:54.267
Bat detector.

25:54.300 --> 25:57.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The-the... hold on.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.633
Found a way we can be useful
to you, have we?

26:01.667 --> 26:04.600
- Oh, here we go.
- What do we get out of it?

26:04.633 --> 26:06.567
- What do you mean?
- You get to save a tree.

26:06.600 --> 26:11.067
- The Bat Action Trust...
- Oh, B-A-T, I just got that.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.300
Oh, that's clever. Is that
another one of yours?

26:13.333 --> 26:16.600
The Bat Action Trust gives
Paul and I the authority

26:16.633 --> 26:18.800
to slap a temporary
preservation order

26:18.833 --> 26:20.433
on any tree we want.

26:20.467 --> 26:22.500
Providing, of course,
we both agree

26:22.533 --> 26:24.600
that it is of special interest.

26:24.633 --> 26:29.700
So, I shall ask again,
what do we get out of it?

26:29.733 --> 26:31.233
What do you want?

26:32.567 --> 26:34.400
We want that field.

26:40.167 --> 26:42.000
Sly bastards.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.633
We can't.

26:44.667 --> 26:47.267
Oh... I couldn't stand it.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.800
Imagine if he was to find
the rest of my hoard

26:49.833 --> 26:52.033
with his crappy Arado.

26:52.067 --> 26:55.700
No. I'd rather nobody found it.

26:55.733 --> 26:58.267
Well, nobody will have
a chance in a week.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.467
Maybe it's time to open it up,
get everybody down here,

27:01.500 --> 27:03.400
next weekend,
before we lose it.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.400
Oh, I don't know.

27:05.433 --> 27:07.600
A week to find it, mate.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.300
Oh, I know it's there.

27:12.433 --> 27:14.533
Under our feet.

27:14.567 --> 27:18.733
Under the lonely earth...
waiting for us.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.033
(Soft tinkling)
