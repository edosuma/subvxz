Political Animals...

00:03.708 --> 00:04.875
ELAINE: <i>You gave T.J. money</i>
<i>for that nightclub,</i>

00:04.943 --> 00:06.410
didn't you?
I thought that if he

00:06.478 --> 00:08.745
had something
that he was proud of that...

00:08.813 --> 00:10.414
he could stay clean this time.

00:10.482 --> 00:11.448
DOUGLAS:
We had a deal.

00:11.516 --> 00:13.550
We had a deal, and you
can't even go...

00:13.618 --> 00:15.586
Stop. What's the point, huh?
...one day without getting high.

00:15.653 --> 00:17.421
I am considering running
for president again.

00:17.489 --> 00:18.555
It's crucial nothing leaks out

00:18.623 --> 00:20.524
before we're ready.

00:20.592 --> 00:22.826
Nobody takes me seriously.
You want to be taken seriously?

00:22.894 --> 00:24.161
Take yourself seriously.

00:24.229 --> 00:25.429
SUSAN:
<i>This is how it works, Douglas.</i>

00:25.497 --> 00:27.331
You help me by giving me

00:27.398 --> 00:29.933
everything I need to know
about your mother's plan.

00:30.001 --> 00:31.468
I owe you now.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.339
Those of us in the Republican
Caucus are united,

00:35.406 --> 00:37.341
and we'll camp out in the House
Chambers over Christmas

00:38.008 --> 00:39.776
if we have to,
but we're not gonna make

00:39.844 --> 00:41.711
the American people
pay for a huge new entitlement

00:41.779 --> 00:43.012
they don't want.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.647
What a putz.
I think he's very attractive.

00:44.715 --> 00:45.882
Yeah, he is.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.617
T.J.:
And he's smart, too. Graduated

00:47.685 --> 00:49.652
<i>summa cum laude</i> from Stanford.
How do you know that?

00:49.720 --> 00:51.554
He had that spread
in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

00:51.622 --> 00:52.756
MARGARET:
"Best abs

00:52.823 --> 00:54.691
on the Hill,"
or something like that.

00:54.759 --> 00:56.392
If only his political opinions

00:56.460 --> 00:58.695
were as toned as his six pack.

00:58.763 --> 00:59.929
Eight pack.

00:59.997 --> 01:01.364
Is that even possible?
T.J: Yep.

01:01.432 --> 01:03.399
Oh, yeah, sweetheart.
You know, it doesn't take

01:03.867 --> 01:06.135
a <i>summa</i> from Stanford
to see that child poverty

01:06.203 --> 01:08.104
in this country is a tragedy.

01:08.172 --> 01:09.238
That douche bag Reeves
is the worst.

01:09.306 --> 01:10.339
I'm not Garcetti's biggest fan,

01:10.407 --> 01:12.175
but it shows how
truly screwed up

01:12.242 --> 01:13.943
this country is
when a first-termer

01:14.011 --> 01:15.178
like Sean Reeves can just stick

01:15.245 --> 01:16.646
his finger in the eye
of the President.

01:16.713 --> 01:17.647
MARGARET:
As far as I'm concerned,

01:17.714 --> 01:19.949
he can put it
wherever he wants.

01:20.017 --> 01:21.384
ELAINE:
T.J., look at this.

01:21.451 --> 01:22.418
Do you remember?

01:22.486 --> 01:24.320
You made this in, uh,

01:24.388 --> 01:26.155
Ms. Bea's third grade
art class.

01:26.223 --> 01:28.424
I've got to get going.

01:28.492 --> 01:29.625
But we just got started.

01:29.693 --> 01:31.227
I have the N.A. meeting.

01:31.295 --> 01:33.262
Okay.

01:33.330 --> 01:35.898
I am so proud
of what you're doing.

01:37.434 --> 01:38.634
I love you, Mama.

01:38.702 --> 01:40.303
I love you, too.

01:45.642 --> 01:47.777
(playing gentle melody)

01:50.047 --> 01:52.481
MAN:
I love it when you play.

01:54.418 --> 01:58.254
God, I can't stay.

01:58.722 --> 02:01.023
We reconvene in an hour.

02:01.091 --> 02:02.758
Still deliberating?

02:02.826 --> 02:03.892
What are you holding on for?

02:03.960 --> 02:05.394
The bill goes way too far.

02:05.462 --> 02:07.229
It gives municipalities
carte blanche

02:07.297 --> 02:09.131
to take kids away from
their parents without enough

02:09.199 --> 02:10.566
judicial review--
that's child endangerment,

02:10.633 --> 02:11.934
not child protection.
Either you just

02:12.002 --> 02:14.837
made me want to switch parties,
or have sex again.

02:14.904 --> 02:17.740
Well, there'll be plenty
of time for that.

02:17.807 --> 02:20.175
We could be here through Christmas...
(phone rings)

02:28.785 --> 02:30.653
My wife.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.421
She's pretty.

02:32.489 --> 02:33.589
Bet you and her

02:33.657 --> 02:35.624
were king and queen
of the prom.

02:35.692 --> 02:37.493
(groans) Oh, God, no.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.695
We were nerds.

02:39.763 --> 02:41.296
Couple of corn-fed,

02:41.364 --> 02:42.731
football loving Methodists.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.901
Was it love at first sight?

02:45.969 --> 02:49.238
I didn't know what
love at first sight was...

02:49.305 --> 02:51.140
till you.

02:53.742 --> 02:56.044
Flirting with me
at a grocery store.

02:56.111 --> 02:58.246
You were shameless...
I had a wedding ring on.

02:58.314 --> 03:00.181
Extra point.

03:00.249 --> 03:02.350
Besides...

03:02.418 --> 03:04.218
I knew you were
checking me out.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.158
Don't you have to leave?

03:10.225 --> 03:11.960
Uh-uh. They can
start without me.

03:12.027 --> 03:14.696
T.J:
<i>Last December...</i>

03:14.763 --> 03:16.731
<i>that's the last time</i>
<i>I was really happy.</i>

03:16.799 --> 03:19.567
Six months clean.

03:19.635 --> 03:21.970
Longest period of time
I'd gone without using

03:22.037 --> 03:24.238
since I was a kid
in the White House.

03:24.306 --> 03:25.573
The fishbowl, you know?

03:26.041 --> 03:27.241
As they call it...

03:27.309 --> 03:30.311
The bubble around
the President's family.

03:30.379 --> 03:33.948
All the eyes, the judgments,
the expectations...

03:34.016 --> 03:37.318
made me feel very alone.

03:37.386 --> 03:38.919
My twin brother could handle it,

03:38.987 --> 03:40.721
but me, not so much.

03:40.789 --> 03:42.590
So...

03:43.057 --> 03:45.225
booze, weed, pills...

03:45.293 --> 03:47.361
made me feel a lot better.

03:47.429 --> 03:49.730
And then I found coke.

03:49.798 --> 03:53.367
And then everything
fell by the wayside.

03:53.435 --> 03:56.270
So my life's...

03:56.337 --> 03:58.372
been pretty much a blur.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.574
Highs...

04:00.642 --> 04:02.443
and lows.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.378
Mostly lows.

04:06.047 --> 04:07.614
I know there's no cure
for this thing,

04:07.682 --> 04:10.417
but there's recovery.

04:12.220 --> 04:13.620
Good share, man.

04:16.391 --> 04:18.791
DOUGLAS:
<i>I didn't know you had kids.</i>

04:18.860 --> 04:20.661
It's my sister's place.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.963
I just locked her
in her bedroom.

04:23.031 --> 04:24.398
Figuratively.

04:25.166 --> 04:26.399
She's infatuated with you.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.902
Remember when you
were on the cover of <i>People?</i>

04:28.969 --> 04:31.538
She had that taped to her mirror
for way too long.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.274
You live with your sister?

04:34.341 --> 04:36.442
It's temporary.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.477
Don't ask, okay?

04:37.545 --> 04:39.145
(soft chuckle)

04:39.213 --> 04:41.114
So...

04:41.182 --> 04:42.515
the run for the White House.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.750
Right.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.387
You do all the asking.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.622
Catch me up on the campaign.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.257
Fundraising, your father's
potential involvement

04:51.325 --> 04:52.392
What campaign?

04:52.459 --> 04:53.593
In the last three weeks

04:53.661 --> 04:55.528
we've flown over 25,000 miles,

04:55.596 --> 04:57.163
<i>crossed every time zone.</i>

04:57.231 --> 04:59.866
<i>My mother's schedule has</i>
<i>included almost everything</i>

04:59.934 --> 05:01.801
<i>except campaigning</i>
<i>for the Presidency.</i>

05:03.537 --> 05:05.638
Well, that was exciting.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.106
Can we go home now?

05:07.174 --> 05:09.676
Is Garcetti finished
keeping me on ice?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.077
Our primary strategy...

05:11.145 --> 05:12.345
three days after we touch down,

05:12.413 --> 05:13.546
we will be up and running.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.781
I'll start rounding up
high-level donors,

05:14.848 --> 05:16.583
give us the leverage
to jump into the primaries

05:16.650 --> 05:18.284
on our own schedule.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.020
Wow. Let's go home.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.188
I'll need that list of donors.

05:22.256 --> 05:24.791
And about your father,
was it your decision

05:24.858 --> 05:26.359
to hire him a publicist?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.261
Mindy Meyers.
Word is

05:28.329 --> 05:29.762
she was brought in
to help rehabilitate

05:29.830 --> 05:31.864
his image
as a reckless womanizer.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.067
Let's be honest,
there's only one...

05:34.134 --> 05:36.603
Elaine Barrish.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.438
And she was...

05:43.477 --> 05:45.711
...and she still is

05:45.779 --> 05:48.447
the love of my life.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.020
Next question.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.054
(TV clicks off)

05:55.122 --> 05:56.355
WOMAN:
If half my clients

05:56.423 --> 05:57.490
stuck to the script like that,

05:57.557 --> 05:59.692
I would be one happy publicist.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.595
You got so choked up,
misty-eyed.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.063
Who knew you had it in you?

06:04.931 --> 06:05.831
Mark my words,
Mr. President,

06:05.898 --> 06:07.766
there will be a tear bump.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.469
A "tear bump?"
Christ sakes.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.205
I'm the man who looked
the Russians in the eye,

06:13.272 --> 06:15.474
and convinced them
to get rid of 5,000

06:15.541 --> 06:17.209
nuclear warheads.
About your son's

06:17.276 --> 06:19.110
club opening this weekend...
you're not going.

06:19.178 --> 06:22.314
I have to be there for him.
And one picture of some drunk coed

06:22.381 --> 06:23.982
with her arm draped around you,
and everything

06:24.050 --> 06:25.484
we've worked for goes to shit.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.853
Now it is your job

06:27.920 --> 06:30.422
to be a good, little boy,
Mr. President.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.357
And it's my job to show
the world

06:32.425 --> 06:34.259
what a good boy you can be.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.229
So is your father going?

06:37.296 --> 06:39.464
To your brother's club opening?

06:39.532 --> 06:41.333
Of course.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.101
Whole family's going.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.070
You don't think that's
bad press waiting to happen?

06:45.137 --> 06:46.505
T.J.'s under supervision.

06:47.072 --> 06:49.707
I got him a 24-hour chaperone
to keep him on the level.

06:49.775 --> 06:51.109
Who's keeping you
on the level through all this?

06:51.176 --> 06:53.244
Anne. My fiancée.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.413
She's, uh, a real trooper.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.581
She must be.

06:56.648 --> 06:59.117
She agreed to sit down
with Georgia Gibbons

06:59.184 --> 07:00.852
to do a puff piece
on her company.

07:00.919 --> 07:03.488
Georgia is the journalist...
I know

07:03.555 --> 07:04.589
who she is.

07:04.656 --> 07:06.457
Look, I will hold my nose,

07:06.525 --> 07:08.226
and slip you a few
political details,

07:08.293 --> 07:09.694
but stop prying into
my family life.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.229
That wasn't part of our deal.

07:11.296 --> 07:13.598
Yeah...
"Somebody has to put

07:13.665 --> 07:15.466
our family first,
we can't take another run."

07:15.534 --> 07:19.370
"Full access" means
full access.

07:20.138 --> 07:22.306
Unless you want me
to tell your mother

07:22.373 --> 07:23.440
how you betrayed her

07:23.508 --> 07:25.709
by coming to me
in the first place.

07:28.213 --> 07:29.713
(clears throat)

07:31.249 --> 07:33.283
You need the full story

07:33.351 --> 07:35.352
or else you already would have
run the scoop.

07:35.420 --> 07:36.954
Why you want it
so badly, Ms. Berg,

07:37.021 --> 07:39.456
I don't know, and I don't care.

07:39.524 --> 07:41.158
Now what I do know is

07:41.226 --> 07:44.695
whatever deal we have,
whatever this is...

07:44.763 --> 07:46.730
you need me
as much as I need you.

PAULINE: <i>At 10:16this
morning, Zulu time,</i>

08:29.307 --> 08:30.874
Naval Station Coronado
intercepted

08:30.942 --> 08:33.275
an emergency distress call

08:33.344 --> 08:35.111
from the Chinese
nuclear submarine

08:35.179 --> 08:37.380
<i>Gui-Lin.</i>
The signal faded quickly,

08:37.448 --> 08:38.682
and 38 seconds later,

08:38.749 --> 08:40.450
the station's hydrophones heard

08:40.518 --> 08:41.885
this...

08:41.953 --> 08:44.020
(deep, muffled scraping)

08:44.087 --> 08:45.755
She bottomed out.

08:45.823 --> 08:48.425
Hard. 13 nautical miles
off San Diego.

08:48.492 --> 08:49.960
COLLIER:
Not surprising really.

08:50.027 --> 08:53.096
The Chinese are spying on us
every way they can.

08:53.164 --> 08:54.731
How many men aboard?
About 100, sir.

08:54.799 --> 08:57.434
So 100 men are trapped

08:57.501 --> 08:59.502
in a sub at the bottom
of the ocean,

08:59.570 --> 09:02.839
getting slowly cooked
by nuclear radiation?

09:02.907 --> 09:04.674
So good to have you back,
Elaine.

09:04.742 --> 09:06.776
The whole country

09:06.844 --> 09:09.446
just about fell apart
while you were overseas.

09:09.513 --> 09:10.981
Forget the crew.

09:11.048 --> 09:13.483
It's San Diego we should
be worried about.

09:13.551 --> 09:15.785
How fast can the Chinese
dispatch a rescue?

09:15.853 --> 09:16.820
In all likelihood, they won't.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.321
The distress call was sent

09:18.389 --> 09:20.223
from depth.
It makes the signal weak.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.458
Such that we can hear it

09:21.525 --> 09:23.193
13 miles away,
but the Chinese can't.

09:23.261 --> 09:25.629
And even if they did...

09:25.696 --> 09:27.497
Chinese can't send
surface ships that close

09:27.565 --> 09:30.267
to our shores without
giving themselves away.

09:30.334 --> 09:32.168
We have to tell them.
COLLIER: Tell them?

09:32.236 --> 09:34.537
COLLIER:
In hell. We wait.

09:34.605 --> 09:37.674
Getting our hands on that sub
will be a major victory

09:37.742 --> 09:38.975
for counter-espionage.

09:39.043 --> 09:41.344
We are talking about 100
of their men

09:41.412 --> 09:43.980
dying slowly from
radiation poisoning,

09:44.048 --> 09:46.616
and you think
letting that happen

09:46.684 --> 09:48.285
is the proper course
of action here?

09:48.352 --> 09:50.186
Elaine...
GARCETTI: Ethics aside,

09:50.254 --> 09:52.322
the Chinese are the world's
second superpower.

09:52.390 --> 09:53.723
Our relationship with them

09:53.791 --> 09:56.259
is the key global partnership
of this century.

09:56.327 --> 09:58.895
Now their boys are in trouble
and we know about it.

09:58.963 --> 10:00.497
I'm sure they'd appreciate
a heads up.

10:00.564 --> 10:02.232
Thank you, sir.
Elaine, you run

10:02.300 --> 10:03.933
back channel on this,
but be cautious.

10:04.001 --> 10:05.869
You'll be telling them
we know they were spying.

10:20.818 --> 10:21.718
Who are you?

10:21.786 --> 10:23.520
I'm, uh, Gunner Cox.

10:23.587 --> 10:24.754
T.J.'s sober partner.

10:24.822 --> 10:26.323
Oh.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.358
Keeping him on the
straight and narrow.

10:28.426 --> 10:29.993
Hmm.

10:30.061 --> 10:32.228
In my day we'd call you
a party pooper.

10:32.296 --> 10:34.030
This place is amazing.

10:34.098 --> 10:36.499
It's like it's right out
of a magazine or something.

10:36.567 --> 10:39.803
That's because it's right
out of a magazine.

10:39.870 --> 10:40.837
Oh, this is...

10:40.905 --> 10:42.472
Gunner.
Please to meet you.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.174
It's very reassuring
to us that you're here.

10:44.241 --> 10:45.775
(door opens)

10:45.843 --> 10:47.310
Ooh. I'm all right.
Sorry, my phone's

10:47.378 --> 10:48.745
been on fire with
the opening night.

10:48.813 --> 10:50.046
Okay, so here's the plan.

10:50.114 --> 10:51.381
We're all gonna convene
here and shuttle over

10:51.449 --> 10:52.515
to the club together.

10:52.583 --> 10:53.683
We'll do the whole
red carpet thing,

10:53.751 --> 10:54.918
and then we'll have
dinner around 10:00.

10:54.985 --> 10:58.121
First of all,
Mother and I don't eat at 10:00.

10:58.189 --> 11:00.123
There's not enough Maalox
in the whole world.

11:00.191 --> 11:01.558
Which is why I spoke to Martin.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.360
So he's gonna set up a
buffet here for everybody.

11:03.427 --> 11:04.527
(phone ringing) Oh, Jesus.

11:04.595 --> 11:06.029
Sorry, I got to get this.

11:06.097 --> 11:07.197
Things fall apart
when I'm not there!

11:07.264 --> 11:08.732
Hello.
(door sliding open and shut)

11:08.799 --> 11:10.934
That is a whole lot of pep.

11:13.971 --> 11:15.972
(indistinct chatter)

11:17.341 --> 11:19.109
What's going on?
Fred said he needed me.

11:19.176 --> 11:21.311
We might have had a
breakthrough on the House vote.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.747
The Child Protection Bill.
I thought that was dead.

11:23.814 --> 11:27.884
Uh, could you folks, uh, give me
and the secretary a moment?

11:27.952 --> 11:29.185
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.353
(sighs)

11:30.421 --> 11:32.489
Elaine, have a seat, please.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.192
Uh, look, uh,

11:36.260 --> 11:38.495
we're gonna get the votes, uh,

11:38.562 --> 11:40.497
just not the way we wanted.

11:41.264 --> 11:43.432
We're gonna turn Sean Reeves,

11:43.500 --> 11:45.568
who turns a dozen other
Republicans our way.

11:45.635 --> 11:46.869
How?

11:46.937 --> 11:48.904
Well, uh, it would seem

11:48.972 --> 11:53.642
that the congressman
from Ohio is a... homosexual,

11:53.710 --> 11:56.245
and neither his constituents
nor his wife

11:56.313 --> 11:57.980
would react very well
to that news.

11:58.048 --> 12:00.249
Fred,

12:00.317 --> 12:02.284
your tactics disgust me.

12:02.352 --> 12:03.786
When the president

12:03.854 --> 12:04.920
hears about this...
Please.

12:04.988 --> 12:06.088
You think he doesn't know?

12:06.156 --> 12:10.059
Look, it just dropped
in our lap, and you know

12:10.127 --> 12:12.962
they'd do the same to us if
they had us by the short hairs.

12:13.029 --> 12:14.663
We're supposed to be better
than they are.

12:14.731 --> 12:17.199
Our party has been trying
to pass a bill like this

12:17.267 --> 12:18.667
for two decades!

12:18.735 --> 12:22.037
You have a lot of your own
blood, sweat and tears in it.

12:22.105 --> 12:24.273
And I'm keeping my distance now.

12:24.341 --> 12:26.342
You're already involved.

12:38.020 --> 12:42.524
Congressman Reeves is having
an affair with your son,

12:42.592 --> 12:43.959
Thomas.

12:44.026 --> 12:45.193
(sighs)

12:45.261 --> 12:47.229
I know your son has had

12:47.296 --> 12:49.297
some problems in the past.

12:49.365 --> 12:52.834
Hate for him to get caught in
some kind of scandal, not that

12:52.902 --> 12:54.369
it has to come to that.

12:54.437 --> 12:55.670
I just, uh...

12:56.706 --> 12:58.673
Thought you should know.

13:05.814 --> 13:08.349
ELAINE:
<i>Li Bao.</i>

13:08.417 --> 13:10.952
Madam Secretary.
So good to see you.

13:11.019 --> 13:12.754
(speaking Mandarin)

13:14.356 --> 13:16.224
(speaking Mandarin)

13:16.291 --> 13:19.660
Forgive me for putting you
out of a job

13:19.728 --> 13:20.828
for just a few minutes,

13:20.896 --> 13:22.997
but my old friend
and I speak several languages,

13:23.065 --> 13:25.233
and it's fun to practice them.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.467
Yes, it is.

13:26.535 --> 13:28.469
(speaking French)

13:28.537 --> 13:30.438
(speaking French)

13:36.078 --> 13:38.045
(laughs)

14:25.127 --> 14:28.629
And then you say, uh,
"It sounds better in English."

14:28.697 --> 14:31.365
You must let sleeping dogs lie.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.468
(laughs)

14:33.535 --> 14:35.937
Always so good to see
you, Madam Secretary.

14:37.973 --> 14:39.974
Your trip was very
much appreciated.

14:48.883 --> 14:51.217
GUNNER: <i>This is the first
time I've seen you nervous.</i>

14:51.285 --> 14:53.052
Who are you trying to impress?

14:53.120 --> 14:54.254
You, Gunner.

14:54.321 --> 14:56.089
I've been hot
and bothered all day

14:56.157 --> 14:57.924
thinking about your balls
tickling my thigh.

14:57.992 --> 14:59.759
So, listen,
can you just park it out

14:59.827 --> 15:01.427
in the car for a few?

15:01.495 --> 15:02.896
Calm down. It's not...

15:02.963 --> 15:05.298
I'm gonna do blow
in the lobby of the Wrigley.

15:08.302 --> 15:10.270
(quietly):
Jesus.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.555
How long has it been going on?

15:28.622 --> 15:31.090
Six months.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.225
He's married, T.J.

15:32.293 --> 15:33.393
I know that, Mom.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.128
So, what were you thinking?

15:35.196 --> 15:36.596
I wasn't thinking anything.

15:36.664 --> 15:38.431
It just kind of happened.

15:38.499 --> 15:40.200
You're gonna let them do this?

15:40.267 --> 15:41.701
Come after us
like some kind of witch hunt?

15:41.769 --> 15:44.704
I think what they're doing is
the lowest form of politics,

15:44.772 --> 15:46.973
but the congressman created
this situation for himself.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.242
It's-it's not a situation.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.444
Whatever it is,
you have to stop it.

15:51.512 --> 15:52.912
No.
Yes.

15:52.980 --> 15:55.181
Because if you think coming out
in the White House was tough...

15:55.249 --> 15:56.883
Oh, don't.

15:56.951 --> 15:58.718
...wait till the press
gets a hold of this.

15:58.786 --> 15:59.853
They will string you up

15:59.920 --> 16:01.521
for every right-wing
weirdo in the country.

16:01.589 --> 16:03.756
Right. That's the last
thing you need right now.

16:03.824 --> 16:04.691
This is 'cause
Sean's a Republican.

16:04.758 --> 16:06.192
How about that?
Oh, come on!

16:06.260 --> 16:08.061
If he was a hot young Democrat
congressman they were after...

16:08.128 --> 16:09.295
That's ridiculous.
...you would have destroyed them.

16:09.363 --> 16:10.496
You are having an affair

16:10.564 --> 16:12.398
with a closeted married man.

16:12.466 --> 16:14.467
That is what concerns me.
You don't know him.

16:14.535 --> 16:16.469
He's trapped in his
marriage, in his life.

16:16.537 --> 16:18.238
He's gonna leave her.

16:18.305 --> 16:19.439
He's a politician.

16:19.506 --> 16:21.608
If he was going to leave her,
he would have done it.

16:21.675 --> 16:23.243
This is my territory.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.745
I was married
to your father, remember?

16:25.812 --> 16:27.413
I'm in love with him, Mom.

16:27.481 --> 16:30.015
I never thought this
was gonna happen to me.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.651
I feel like a different person
when we're together.

16:32.719 --> 16:34.787
And I haven't been high
in six months.

16:34.855 --> 16:37.289
Not even an aspirin.
You are tying your sobriety to this asshole.

16:37.357 --> 16:38.457
You are in so much trouble.

16:38.525 --> 16:39.925
Then help us.

16:39.993 --> 16:42.094
You can't let them
threaten him like this.

16:42.162 --> 16:43.262
You got to stop them.

16:43.330 --> 16:44.864
Oh, come on.
I'm... I'm sorry.

16:44.931 --> 16:47.166
I can't, and I won't.

16:47.234 --> 16:49.034
You're the most important woman
in the world,

16:49.102 --> 16:51.303
and you can't help me?!
I'm trying to help you.

16:51.371 --> 16:53.139
That is what I'm doing.

16:53.206 --> 16:54.840
You just can't see it!

16:54.908 --> 16:56.375
T.J!

16:56.443 --> 16:58.444
(door slams)

17:03.349 --> 17:05.282
T.J.?

17:05.351 --> 17:08.086
Sean.

17:08.154 --> 17:10.055
(laughs) Hi.

17:10.123 --> 17:11.423
Wow.

17:11.491 --> 17:13.525
Oh. Uh, you...

17:13.593 --> 17:16.094
You look... great.

17:16.162 --> 17:17.762
(laughs) Thank you.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.865
Yeah.

17:19.932 --> 17:22.434
Hey, I, um...

17:22.502 --> 17:23.868
I heard some things.

17:23.935 --> 17:25.936
I was a little concerned.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.675
Total rumors.

17:32.044 --> 17:33.979
Well, mostly.

17:34.046 --> 17:36.381
Yeah, well, I-I wish we
could talk more, but...

17:36.449 --> 17:38.517
No. I'm slammed, too.

17:38.584 --> 17:40.585
I'm opening a nightclub.

17:40.653 --> 17:43.188
Oh, you know, I, um...
I read about that.

17:43.256 --> 17:45.157
You should come.

17:45.224 --> 17:46.658
Yeah, I'd-I'd like that.

17:46.726 --> 17:48.560
I'll... I'll have my
secretary call for details.

17:48.628 --> 17:50.295
I always knew you'd be

17:50.363 --> 17:53.031
running this town
one of these days.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.102
(sighs)

17:59.606 --> 18:00.772
Listen, thanks for trying,
Elaine.

18:00.840 --> 18:01.940
We've done everything we can.

18:02.008 --> 18:03.742
We can rescue them ourselves...

18:03.810 --> 18:05.911
The president's decided
to respect the wishes...

18:05.979 --> 18:08.380
We can't just give up
on a hundred lives.

18:08.448 --> 18:12.351
Spare us the morality talk when
you're plotting a coup d'état.

18:12.418 --> 18:15.053
A what?

18:15.121 --> 18:17.155
Come on.

18:17.223 --> 18:19.291
You're planning to unseat us.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.425
It's been obvious

18:20.493 --> 18:22.160
since you forced
the president's hand

18:22.228 --> 18:23.395
on Iran just

18:23.463 --> 18:25.430
to rehabilitate
your philandering husband.

18:25.498 --> 18:28.333
My ex-husband, Fred,
and I don't have to stand here

18:28.401 --> 18:29.835
and listen to this crap.

18:29.903 --> 18:32.271
You think we don't know about
his little trip to Jubal Jacobs?

18:32.338 --> 18:34.606
Now he's on TV
blubbering like a baby?

18:34.674 --> 18:37.075
Come on, Elaine.
We're not idiots.

18:37.143 --> 18:39.111
Well... I thought you
might have the decency

18:39.178 --> 18:40.779
to resign first, but no.

18:40.847 --> 18:43.315
You want to attack us
from inside the gates.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.983
It's sedition.

18:45.651 --> 18:50.054
What Fred is responding to is
the idle chatter around town,

18:50.122 --> 18:53.324
so I'll chalk up his
accusation to loyalty

18:53.392 --> 18:54.659
to you.

18:54.727 --> 18:56.394
It's out of the same loyalty

18:56.462 --> 18:58.162
that I am here reminding you

18:58.230 --> 19:01.332
of how strongly you feel
about saving these men.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.868
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

19:05.638 --> 19:06.538
Your loyalty.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.339
Listen, Elaine,

19:08.407 --> 19:10.041
it's done.

19:10.109 --> 19:11.609
Those boys are now
a Chinese problem.

19:11.677 --> 19:13.611
And if they're dropping it,

19:13.679 --> 19:15.480
I think we should, too.

19:16.682 --> 19:18.550
ANNE:
<i>All my experience</i>

19:18.617 --> 19:19.817
was in Southern California...
Mm-hmm.

19:19.885 --> 19:22.153
...so it... it took me
a while to adjust

19:22.221 --> 19:24.322
to Washington's more
traditional aesthetic.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.825
Right. Well, D.C. is
certainly discovering you.

19:27.893 --> 19:31.228
You were just hired by RG3, the
Redskins' rookie quarterback.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.398
8,600 square feet to be
completed by the fall

19:34.466 --> 19:36.367
and the start of
the NFL season.

19:37.034 --> 19:39.336
How would that conflict with
your fiancé's schedule?

19:39.403 --> 19:41.204
Oh, he already works
all the time.

19:41.272 --> 19:43.373
Yeah. His hours as his
mother's chief of staff

19:43.441 --> 19:44.608
must be pretty grim, huh?

19:44.675 --> 19:46.009
Yeah.

19:46.077 --> 19:48.044
The campaign's only gonna
make it worse, right?

19:48.112 --> 19:49.846
Times ten.

19:49.914 --> 19:52.182
So, will your wedding
take place before

19:52.250 --> 19:53.950
or after the formal
announcement?

19:54.018 --> 19:55.986
What announcement?

19:56.053 --> 19:58.121
Elaine's campaign
for president?

19:58.189 --> 20:01.324
Which you just said will
make Douglas even busier.

20:03.361 --> 20:04.728
(laughs)

20:04.796 --> 20:07.731
Would you like to see my designs
for Robert's home theater?

20:07.799 --> 20:09.065
No, I want to talk

20:09.133 --> 20:11.034
about how your future
mother-in-law plans

20:11.102 --> 20:13.203
to run for president in
the Democratic primary.

20:13.271 --> 20:17.040
I shouldn't have said...
whatever I said.

20:17.108 --> 20:19.910
Uh, I would like to make that
off the record.

20:19.977 --> 20:21.878
That's not how it works.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.079
You have to call
"off-the-record"

20:23.147 --> 20:24.281
before you say something.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.116
But don't worry.
No one will find out.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.584
I won't use your name...

20:27.652 --> 20:30.887
if you just nod "yes" or "no"
when I ask a simple question.

20:30.955 --> 20:33.557
Okay.

20:33.624 --> 20:36.293
Has Elaine Barrish discussed
with her family her intentions

20:36.360 --> 20:38.829
to run for president
in the upcoming primary?

20:41.833 --> 20:43.033
(laughs)

20:44.200 --> 20:45.868
DOUGLAS:
<i>She got it on record?</i>

20:45.936 --> 20:47.069
Look, she tricked me, Douglas.

20:47.137 --> 20:48.971
I didn't even know
what I was saying

20:49.039 --> 20:50.105
until I'd already said it.

20:50.173 --> 20:51.273
But it's on record?

20:51.341 --> 20:53.375
Look, I... I tried
to take it back, okay?

20:53.443 --> 20:54.576
I should have never

20:54.644 --> 20:56.578
talked to her. Your
mom's gonna hate me

20:56.646 --> 20:58.781
even more than she already does.
My mother does not hate, you,

20:58.848 --> 21:01.050
okay, and this is not
your fault, Annie.

21:01.117 --> 21:02.751
It's that bottom feeder's.

21:02.819 --> 21:04.720
Listen, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

21:04.788 --> 21:06.121
hey, hey.

21:06.189 --> 21:08.123
I know how to fix it.

21:08.191 --> 21:09.291
You do?
Mm-hmm.

21:09.359 --> 21:11.126
Now, go get ready
for T.J.'s opening,

21:11.194 --> 21:13.329
and please put on
that sexy, green dress

21:13.396 --> 21:15.731
that makes me want
to tear it off you.

21:21.338 --> 21:22.905
Where are you?
My apartment.

21:22.973 --> 21:23.939
Nice elephants.

21:24.007 --> 21:25.274
Thanks. Listen...

21:25.342 --> 21:26.408
Sure you don't want to give me
the full Skype tour?

21:26.476 --> 21:27.643
Georgia got Anne
to spill the beans

21:27.711 --> 21:28.644
about my mother's run
for the White House.

21:28.712 --> 21:30.779
Jesus, Douglas!
I warned you.

21:30.847 --> 21:31.981
Georgia ambushed her, okay?

21:32.048 --> 21:33.582
It was a very sophisticated line
of questioning.

21:33.650 --> 21:35.117
Georgia doesn't even know
how to spell sophisticated.

21:35.185 --> 21:36.552
Well, it's done, okay?

21:36.619 --> 21:40.255
And now you need to stop it,
or else, we're both screwed.

21:41.558 --> 21:43.525
(sighs)

21:45.562 --> 21:47.529
(sighs)

21:54.337 --> 21:56.738
(chuckles)
Make yourself at home, Bud.

21:56.806 --> 21:58.473
I'm here for
T.J.'s dinner.

21:58.541 --> 22:00.442
Whoa.

22:00.509 --> 22:01.643
Admiral Taft

22:01.711 --> 22:02.911
was right.

22:02.979 --> 22:04.479
You look fantastic

22:04.547 --> 22:06.314
for a woman who's just
been around the world,

22:06.382 --> 22:08.350
not to mention getting
called into the sit room

22:08.417 --> 22:09.384
your first day back.

22:09.452 --> 22:12.220
Yeah, I just assumed.

22:12.288 --> 22:13.822
No, why else
would you be rubbing elbows

22:13.889 --> 22:15.156
with the commander
of the Pacific fleet?

22:15.224 --> 22:17.158
You know the rules, Bud.

22:19.328 --> 22:22.197
Heard you paid a visit to
the Chinese embassy, too.

22:23.264 --> 22:25.466
I saw the DCM.

22:25.533 --> 22:28.602
Oh, a back-channel meeting
between the Chinese DCM

22:28.670 --> 22:29.837
and the American
secretary of state.

22:29.904 --> 22:31.138
Whatever

22:31.206 --> 22:35.643
is going on must be
as delicate as an ass pimple.

22:35.710 --> 22:38.045
Please tell me we didn't sink
one of their ships.

22:38.113 --> 22:39.079
We didn't sink one
of their ships.

22:39.147 --> 22:41.415
But one of their
ships went down.

22:41.483 --> 22:43.617
So, the only reason a downed
Chinese vessel would matter--

22:43.685 --> 22:45.653
if it was close to our waters.

22:47.622 --> 22:50.858
Chinese got a downed sub
near our shore.

22:50.925 --> 22:52.292
Holy son of a bitch.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.328
(scoffs)

22:55.764 --> 22:57.698
You are something.

22:57.766 --> 23:01.402
God forbid one of their sons
was stuck down there.

23:01.469 --> 23:02.536
Crew's still alive?

23:02.604 --> 23:03.504
Not for long.

23:03.571 --> 23:06.974
Baking in nuclear radiation.

23:07.042 --> 23:09.410
And Garcetti won't lift
a greasy finger.

23:09.477 --> 23:10.778
This is perfect.

23:12.313 --> 23:14.982
To get your campaign out of
the barn, you need a reason

23:15.050 --> 23:17.117
to leave that administration.

23:17.185 --> 23:19.019
All right, now, with
Elaine Barrish in charge,

23:19.087 --> 23:21.155
America is a country
that saves lives,

23:21.222 --> 23:24.458
even if they are Chinese.

23:24.526 --> 23:26.660
Now, that could be
the narrative of your exit.

23:26.728 --> 23:27.695
No, it can't.

23:27.762 --> 23:30.297
The situation
is classified, Bud.

23:30.365 --> 23:34.435
Yeah, well, these things
have a way of leaking out.

23:34.502 --> 23:35.869
No one can know about this,

23:35.937 --> 23:38.272
Bud, I mean it,

23:38.339 --> 23:41.375
and you've done
enough leaking for this week.

23:41.443 --> 23:43.610
Oh, you saw that, huh?

23:43.678 --> 23:47.114
Honestly, I can't remember
the last time I saw you cry.

23:47.182 --> 23:48.515
Who is she--

23:48.583 --> 23:51.218
this flack you must have hired?

23:51.286 --> 23:53.087
No man alive
could get you to cry

23:53.154 --> 23:55.355
on national television.

23:55.423 --> 23:59.460
Has to be a woman, obviously
someone you're sleeping with.

23:59.527 --> 24:02.129
Mindy Meyers.

24:02.197 --> 24:05.566
Ah, she swears I'll
get a bump out of it.

24:05.633 --> 24:08.869
Bud, first rule of D.C.--

24:08.937 --> 24:11.171
never hire anyone from L.A.

24:11.239 --> 24:13.107
(sighs)
Is this because Jubal said

24:13.174 --> 24:15.909
you can't be involved
in my campaign?

24:16.777 --> 24:18.444
No, it doesn't matter
what the polls say.

24:18.512 --> 24:20.046
We're still divorced.

24:20.114 --> 24:21.047
We always had

24:21.115 --> 24:22.448
our ups and downs.

24:22.516 --> 24:25.318
Are you that desperate to get
back in the White House?

24:25.386 --> 24:26.319
I told you

24:26.387 --> 24:29.022
I wasn't giving up on you,

24:29.089 --> 24:32.492
and I will follow you
wherever you go, Sugar.

24:36.230 --> 24:38.765
T.J. will be home soon.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.664
Congratulations.

24:51.732 --> 24:52.865
Anne Ogami.

24:52.933 --> 24:54.734
It's an angle no one
else thought to take.

24:54.802 --> 24:56.335
Good work.
How do you know about that?

24:56.403 --> 24:57.537
I'm deep inside
the Hammond camp.

24:57.604 --> 24:59.005
Have been for weeks.

24:59.073 --> 25:01.808
What I hear you have
is too thin to run.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.342
I have enough, Susan.
See, that's the problem.

25:03.410 --> 25:04.677
It's my story, not yours.

25:04.745 --> 25:06.479
I have a prior claim.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.081
I'm, I'm light-years
ahead of you.

25:08.148 --> 25:12.452
Now, if that were true,
you'd have published already.

25:13.487 --> 25:15.788
(chuckles)

25:15.856 --> 25:19.092
Journalism is about
quality, not speed.

25:19.159 --> 25:22.762
People come to this paper,
they read at length

25:22.830 --> 25:25.732
about something important
to American political life.

25:25.799 --> 25:27.567
Takes 'em all of breakfast
to get through it,

25:27.634 --> 25:28.835
and when they're done,

25:28.902 --> 25:31.237
they are better informed
citizens of a democracy.

25:31.305 --> 25:33.172
300,000 people read this paper.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.410
When I post, I'll get
ten million direct views.

25:37.478 --> 25:40.146
Elaine Barrish is running,
and I broke it.

25:41.114 --> 25:42.147
And you'll be a blogger

25:42.215 --> 25:44.883
who broke a headline,

25:44.951 --> 25:47.152
not a journalist who
reported a story.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.353
You'll get views, of course,

25:48.421 --> 25:50.222
but neither you nor this
paper will get an ounce

25:50.289 --> 25:52.157
of prestige from it.

25:52.225 --> 25:55.527
A story takes effort, time.

25:55.595 --> 25:56.762
It takes reporting.

25:56.829 --> 26:00.699
Look, I can include the
Anne stuff in my piece.

26:00.767 --> 26:01.900
You'll have contributed.

26:01.968 --> 26:03.935
I'll have contributed
to your glory maybe.

26:04.003 --> 26:05.937
That's not good enough.

26:06.005 --> 26:08.974
There is nothing to stop me from
running this story right now.

26:09.042 --> 26:12.444
I'll get Alex to give you
an additional reporting credit.

26:12.512 --> 26:14.413
No.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.481
You'll bring me
in on it completely.

26:17.149 --> 26:18.683
No way.
You teach me the longer game,

26:18.751 --> 26:21.986
and when we publish,
we split the credit 50-50.

26:22.054 --> 26:23.087
I get half the byline.

26:23.155 --> 26:24.856
That's not going to happen.

26:24.923 --> 26:25.857
So you'd rather

26:25.924 --> 26:28.493
I just upload that
tonight, then?

26:28.560 --> 26:30.928
Tell you what.

26:30.996 --> 26:31.929
Saturday's dead

26:31.997 --> 26:33.364
for traffic.

26:33.432 --> 26:37.035
I'm much better off posting this
first thing Monday morning.

26:45.177 --> 26:46.477
MARGARET:
Anne, be careful

26:46.545 --> 26:47.912
getting out of the limo

26:47.980 --> 26:50.181
'cause those photographers
love to get a beaver shot.

26:50.249 --> 26:52.016
Thanks, Margaret.
You know,

26:52.084 --> 26:54.118
I'd like to argue, but in
fact she's probably right.

26:54.186 --> 26:55.119
I am.

26:55.187 --> 26:56.387
(laughter)

26:56.455 --> 26:58.556
Would you make me another
martini, please? Sure.

26:58.624 --> 27:00.692
Mother.
Well, he's on payroll.

27:00.759 --> 27:02.660
As a sober partner.
Happy to.

27:02.728 --> 27:04.228
Just don't sen
me for oxycodone.

27:04.296 --> 27:05.463
That was my beast.

27:05.531 --> 27:06.831
MARGARET:
Oh, charming.

27:06.899 --> 27:08.833
Chill it
till my teeth hurt, huh?

27:08.901 --> 27:09.901
(laughter)

27:10.668 --> 27:12.069
Guys, I just,

27:12.137 --> 27:15.039
um... I just want
to tell you guys

27:15.106 --> 27:17.241
how much tonight means to me.

27:19.277 --> 27:20.644
I know you all had
doubts, but...

27:22.247 --> 27:24.148
I really feel
like this is the beginning

27:24.215 --> 27:26.750
of a whole new,
good chapter of my life,

27:26.818 --> 27:28.085
so...

27:28.153 --> 27:31.789
About tonight, son,
I'm afraid I can't go.

27:32.791 --> 27:35.392
DOUGLAS:
Mindy Meyer

27:35.460 --> 27:37.494
got you crying
on Letterman tonight?

27:37.562 --> 27:39.563
Well, this has nothing
do with her.

27:39.631 --> 27:40.998
I wouldn't anymore
attend this thing

27:41.066 --> 27:42.800
than I'd watch someone toss

27:42.867 --> 27:45.602
a baby seal
into the jaws of an orca.

27:45.670 --> 27:47.004
Bud.
That's about

27:47.072 --> 27:49.673
as much chance as T.J. has,
keeping straight in a nightclub.

27:49.741 --> 27:50.741
(sighs)

27:51.709 --> 27:53.343
Tell me, when did you decide
to write me off?

27:53.410 --> 27:54.610
You have a serious problem,

27:54.678 --> 27:57.213
son, and you just keep adding
fuel to the fire.

27:57.281 --> 27:58.881
Oh, well, maybe if I was
a pussy-hound like you,

27:58.949 --> 27:59.882
then I'd get
a little compassion.

27:59.950 --> 28:01.217
You never believed in me.

28:01.285 --> 28:02.986
Ever since I came out,
ever since...

28:03.053 --> 28:03.987
Oh, w-what?

28:04.054 --> 28:06.189
You think I care
who you sleep with?

28:06.256 --> 28:10.126
T.J. you could have married
your childhood sweetheart

28:10.194 --> 28:11.928
and done it missionary
style for 50 years.

28:11.996 --> 28:13.062
You'd still be an addict.

28:13.130 --> 28:14.364
Okay, Bud, you've
made your point.

28:14.431 --> 28:15.598
You are not going.

28:15.666 --> 28:18.101
Now, if you'd just
stuck with the piano...

28:18.168 --> 28:20.603
With this club, I finally have
something that's mine.

28:20.671 --> 28:22.038
Yours?

28:22.106 --> 28:23.940
You couldn't squeeze the money
from me or your mama,

28:24.008 --> 28:25.641
so you went running to Dougie.

28:25.709 --> 28:27.076
(scoffs)

28:27.144 --> 28:29.112
So much for our little secret?

28:29.179 --> 28:30.680
I did not say anything,
I swear to you.

28:30.748 --> 28:31.948
GUNNER:
Could I just say something?

28:32.016 --> 28:33.383
MARGARET:
Oh, Jesus.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.418
Bad idea, sweetie.
Now, these past three weeks,

28:35.486 --> 28:38.421
T.J. has been really
committed to his sobriety

28:38.489 --> 28:40.289
and he's doing an excellent
job with the club.

28:40.357 --> 28:41.290
I think you guys

28:41.358 --> 28:42.425
would be really
impressed to see

28:42.493 --> 28:43.559
the guest list that
are coming tonight,

28:43.627 --> 28:44.927
and it's all because
of your son.

28:44.995 --> 28:46.963
Well, and who, pray tell?

28:47.031 --> 28:49.699
Henry Kissinger, Desmond Tutu?

28:49.767 --> 28:51.334
Bud.
Um, what's-his-name

28:51.402 --> 28:53.736
- from <i>The Voice,</i> uh,
the congressman from Ohio. - No,

28:53.804 --> 28:55.805
oh, Gunn-- oh, no.

28:55.873 --> 28:58.274
Sean Reeves?

28:58.342 --> 28:59.876
Yeah, that-that's him.

28:59.943 --> 29:01.210
Really?

29:02.246 --> 29:05.281
That's what all this is about?

29:05.349 --> 29:09.252
That's why you're buzzing
100 million miles an hour?

29:09.319 --> 29:10.319
Are you two together?

29:10.387 --> 29:11.320
Of course not.

29:11.388 --> 29:12.588
Just let me explain.

29:12.656 --> 29:14.157
I...
No, I think

29:14.224 --> 29:16.692
this once I agree
with your father.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.895
Going tonight is
a really terrible idea.

29:18.962 --> 29:21.497
Wow, you, you always manage
to abandon me

29:21.565 --> 29:22.732
when I need you the most.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.301
When did this become my fault?

29:25.369 --> 29:27.837
He's the one who cheated
on his wife behind her back.

29:27.905 --> 29:29.839
He's the one who said

29:29.907 --> 29:32.341
he loved you
and then disappeared

29:32.409 --> 29:33.743
when it got tough.

29:33.811 --> 29:35.111
I'm the one who found you...

29:37.314 --> 29:39.282
...barely alive.

29:41.919 --> 29:45.421
I hope you're not expecting me
to thank you for that.

29:46.924 --> 29:48.891
Because I never will.

29:52.495 --> 29:54.396
DOUGLAS:
All right,

29:54.464 --> 29:56.498
well, I think it's time
that we all head out.

29:56.566 --> 29:59.468
No, no, no, no,
stay, all of you.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.036
No one really gives a shit.

30:01.104 --> 30:03.072
Come on.

30:04.941 --> 30:07.276
Every time

30:07.344 --> 30:10.479
I have stood by
and lifted you up

30:10.547 --> 30:11.814
and made excuses

30:11.881 --> 30:14.883
for you, and it hasn't worked,

30:14.951 --> 30:17.553
not once.

30:17.621 --> 30:19.521
I'm done, sweetheart.

30:19.589 --> 30:21.590
I am spent.

30:23.627 --> 30:28.597
(voice breaking): I hope
tonight is a huge success.

30:55.334 --> 30:57.268
Holy shit.

30:57.336 --> 30:59.937
Just stay out
of any TV shot, okay?

31:00.005 --> 31:00.972
Okay.

31:11.083 --> 31:14.919
How could they do this--
your mother's cronies?

31:14.987 --> 31:17.388
This is my life, my career,

31:17.456 --> 31:18.890
anything I've ever cared
anything about.

31:18.957 --> 31:21.459
I mean, God,
they're destroying everything.

31:21.527 --> 31:24.162
Sean, I know it sucks,
but this is an opportunity

31:24.229 --> 31:26.164
for you to finally b-be free.

31:26.231 --> 31:28.766
There's no more sneaking
around, no more being hidden.

31:28.834 --> 31:29.767
Hey,

31:29.835 --> 31:32.570
I know, I know
this is a scary thing.

31:32.638 --> 31:33.771
I went through the same thing.

31:33.839 --> 31:36.774
Oh, come on.

31:36.842 --> 31:38.042
You came out as a kid.

31:38.110 --> 31:39.510
You weren't
blackmailed into it.

31:39.578 --> 31:40.912
You had your, your
mother, your father,

31:40.979 --> 31:42.914
the whole country rallying
around your courage.

31:42.981 --> 31:44.549
You think this country
is gonna applaud me

31:44.616 --> 31:47.385
for breaking my wife's heart,
huh, for lying to everyone?

31:48.520 --> 31:52.790
You can do this,
Sean, I promise.

31:52.858 --> 31:53.958
We can do this together.

31:54.026 --> 31:54.959
Come here.

31:55.027 --> 31:56.227
Don't touch me!

31:57.929 --> 31:59.797
Yeah, we had
sex, T.J.

31:59.864 --> 32:01.799
Big deal.

32:01.866 --> 32:04.168
I was lonely, and,
yeah, it felt good,

32:04.235 --> 32:05.569
especially if I
kept my eyes closed

32:05.637 --> 32:07.171
and it was fine while
it was happening,

32:07.238 --> 32:09.840
but I always left here
feeling disgusted with myself.

32:09.908 --> 32:11.241
No, y-y-you don't mean that.

32:12.209 --> 32:13.343
I'm not like you, all right?

32:13.410 --> 32:15.812
I've got a life, a career.

32:15.879 --> 32:17.947
I'm not some pathetic
American punch line.

32:19.450 --> 32:21.584
This life of yours-- or
whatever you want to call it--

32:21.652 --> 32:24.687
may be okay for you,
but I want more.

32:24.755 --> 32:26.723

32:30.661 --> 32:32.895

32:32.963 --> 32:35.898
If it ain't the man of the hour.

32:35.966 --> 32:38.000
Good-looking on the VIP pass.

32:38.068 --> 32:39.702
Please, you're
my guest of honor.

32:39.770 --> 32:42.038
All right.
But you been out of the game.

32:42.106 --> 32:45.074
Might want to take it slow.

SUSAN:
<i>Georgia Gibbons won't</i>

32:55.719 --> 32:57.253
back off the story.

32:57.321 --> 33:00.690
She's determined to break your
mother's run for the presidency.

33:00.758 --> 33:01.891
Isn't she your second source?

33:01.959 --> 33:03.693
Not for the kind
of reporting she does.

33:03.761 --> 33:06.295
I'll have to run my story
first-- not the piece

33:06.363 --> 33:09.198
I wanted, but at least it will
appear in an actual newspaper.

33:09.266 --> 33:10.533
What do I tell my mother?

33:10.601 --> 33:12.101
Tell her to draft
her letter of resignation.

33:12.169 --> 33:13.870
Otherwise, Garcetti's gonna
read about it in the <i>Globe.</i>

33:13.937 --> 33:16.038
That girl is smarter

33:16.106 --> 33:17.840
than she lets on.
She actually tried

33:17.908 --> 33:19.642
to bully me
into sharing a byline.

33:19.710 --> 33:21.210
(chuckles) And you said no?

33:21.278 --> 33:23.246
Uh, yeah.
Are you kidding me?

33:23.313 --> 33:25.481
You... you'd rather kill
my mother's campaign

33:25.549 --> 33:26.816
than share a credit?

33:26.884 --> 33:29.152
You would be derailing
a woman's first real shot

33:29.219 --> 33:30.753
at the presidency.
Aren't you getting

33:30.821 --> 33:32.121
a little ahead
of yourself here?

33:32.189 --> 33:33.656
My mother can win.

33:33.724 --> 33:35.892
Okay? I've seen how her numbers
stack up against Garcetti's.

33:35.959 --> 33:37.960
If you can just
keep a lid on this

33:38.028 --> 33:40.129
long enough for us
to build an organization.

33:40.197 --> 33:41.130
Why would I do that?
Because...

33:41.198 --> 33:44.834
you want her to win.
You want her to win!

33:44.902 --> 33:46.302
You could've killed her campaign

33:46.370 --> 33:47.470
weeks ago.

33:47.538 --> 33:49.105
Because after all those years

33:49.173 --> 33:51.073
of tearing her down,
she has finally

33:51.141 --> 33:54.043
become the politician
that you want her to be.

33:54.111 --> 33:56.913
Jesus, Douglas, I'm gonna blush.

33:56.980 --> 34:00.917
You don't just want her to win
for noble reasons.

34:00.984 --> 34:03.219
You live with your sister.

34:03.287 --> 34:05.788
Look at all you sacrifice
for your career.

34:05.856 --> 34:07.356
And for what?

34:08.123 --> 34:10.159
So that you could have
some ancient Pulitzer

34:10.226 --> 34:12.060
collecting dust in the
lobby of the <i>Globe?</i>

34:12.128 --> 34:14.263
Tell me you don't
want a shiny new one

34:14.330 --> 34:16.431
to place right next to it.

34:16.498 --> 34:20.302
You want it as bad as I want to
be White House Chief of Staff,

34:20.370 --> 34:21.703
and like it or not,

34:21.771 --> 34:23.871
in order for our dreams
to come true,

34:23.940 --> 34:26.041

It's a rocket ship.

34:39.956 --> 34:41.924
Come here, buddy.

34:41.991 --> 34:43.692
It's way past your bedtime.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.726
Do me a solid, okay?
Okay.

34:45.795 --> 34:47.429
Get your mommy to tuck you in?
Okay.

34:47.496 --> 34:48.530
Kiss?

34:49.197 --> 34:50.498
All right.
I love you.

34:50.565 --> 34:51.800
Good night, Trevor.
Good night.

34:53.068 --> 34:54.835
You want to talk to me?

34:54.904 --> 34:56.871
Come on in.

35:02.478 --> 35:04.579
It's been obvious for some time

35:04.647 --> 35:07.749
that I am out of step
with this administration.

35:07.817 --> 35:11.853
And what happened today
made that even more clear.

35:11.921 --> 35:15.290
I am running against you.

35:15.357 --> 35:19.260
I've reached out to a few
donors and done some polling,

35:19.328 --> 35:22.597
and I will resign in 48 hours,

35:22.665 --> 35:27.268

those men together.

35:29.571 --> 35:32.440
The president who leaves those
sailors on the ocean floor

35:32.507 --> 35:34.008
deserves to be dethroned,

35:34.076 --> 35:38.045
and you know that
better than anybody.

35:38.113 --> 35:41.549
The people chose you
to lead this country,

35:41.616 --> 35:44.285
not Collier, not me.

35:44.353 --> 35:45.619
You.

35:50.859 --> 35:54.261
I ought to fire you right
on the spot, you know that?

35:54.329 --> 35:56.197
You won't.

36:05.741 --> 36:07.942
Knowing you're
gonna run against me,

36:08.009 --> 36:10.878
that gives me
a hell of an advantage, Elaine.

36:10.946 --> 36:13.948
And don't for one minute
think I won't use it. Good.
