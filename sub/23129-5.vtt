00:03.170 --> 00:04.160
- Previously on Being Human:

00:04.230 --> 00:05.698
- I'm like you.
I'm a wolf,

00:05.770 --> 00:06.840
- Push!

00:06.900 --> 00:08.129
(Caroline screaming)

00:08.200 --> 00:10.009
- She's perfect.

00:11.740 --> 00:14.380
- What do you think?
- How did you pull it off? Club?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.078
Getting the
vampires in line?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.403
- Someone like me can be
a pretty smart fighter.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.414
- You can change
the way you look?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.117
- I can control what people see.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.557
- Oh my God!

00:26.620 --> 00:29.282
The house! The '70s!

00:29.360 --> 00:30.759
I'm travelling through time.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.855
- If you really love this girl,

00:32.930 --> 00:35.228
the best thing you can do
is break up with her.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.223
- I have been lying to you.

00:37.300 --> 00:40.099
Because I am a vampire.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.032
(Laughing)

00:44.570 --> 00:47.335
(Laughing)

00:47.410 --> 00:49.606
- Oh! Oh my God, your face!

00:49.680 --> 00:50.772
(Laughing)

00:50.850 --> 00:53.114
- You're laughing, all right.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.670
I wasn't exactly
expecting this.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.412
- I didn't expect you

00:57.490 --> 00:59.254
to tell me that you're Dracula.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.254
- Kat, I'm telling
you the truth.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.395
- Oh, you really believe this.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.667
- It's not a question
of what I believe.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.289
It's a question of what is.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.269
I am a vampire.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.333
- OK.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.569
- So--50, you can
ask me questions. You--

01:19.640 --> 01:21.130
Say something.
Say anything.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.144
- It's gonna be OK.

01:23.210 --> 01:25.349
We're gonna get help.

01:25.410 --> 01:26.775
- Help...

01:26.850 --> 01:28.909
- We're gonna talk
to a professional and--

01:28.980 --> 01:31.483
- OK, no more talking.
Listen, listen, listen...

01:33.460 --> 01:34.484
(Inhaling deeply)

01:34.560 --> 01:35.618
What do you hear?

01:35.690 --> 01:37.488
- Nothing.
I don't hear anything.

01:40.730 --> 01:42.494
I don't hear your heartbeat.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.559
That's because
I don't have one.

01:50.970 --> 01:52.404
- No, there's gotta be--

01:52.480 --> 01:54.300
- Kat, OK. Kat,
Kat, listen to me.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.529
I'm gonna do something...

01:56.780 --> 01:59.715
and I just need
you to trust me, OK?

02:00.820 --> 02:02.584
Trust me.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.158
Kat, it's still me.

02:18.870 --> 02:22.238
- (Kat): Have you killed people?
Are you a killer?

02:22.310 --> 02:23.732
(Sobbing)

02:23.810 --> 02:25.460
- I love you.

02:25.540 --> 02:26.871
- How can I trust you?

02:28.680 --> 02:30.307
(Paper rustling)

02:30.380 --> 02:31.302
How many?

02:35.020 --> 02:37.990
Jeff, my ex, went missing
right after you met him.

02:38.050 --> 02:40.917
- Oh God, Kat, no!
No, no, no. No.

02:40.990 --> 02:43.630
I don't do that anymore.
That's not me anymore.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.798
That isn't gonna
do you any good.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.669
- Who else knows
what you are?

02:50.730 --> 02:52.835
- Just the people
I live with, Kat,

02:52.900 --> 02:55.232
just Josh and Nora and Sally.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.699
- Who's Sally?

02:57.910 --> 02:59.605
(Sighing)

02:59.680 --> 03:03.002
** Tl meet with him... *

03:03.080 --> 03:04.969
- Tell me what you're feeling.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.575
* The last time... *

03:06.650 --> 03:08.243
You can be honest with me.

03:10.550 --> 03:12.757
* The last time... *

03:12.820 --> 03:14.458
- Scared.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.525
I feel scared.

03:17.590 --> 03:18.523
- That's...

03:19.600 --> 03:20.795
That's normal.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.692
It's a crazy
situation.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.898
- I'm not scared
of the situation.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.836
* Dance like this... *

03:26.900 --> 03:28.595
It's you.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.260
I'm scared of you.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.507
- OK.

03:36.610 --> 03:39.409
Um, if you need me
to go, I can--

03:39.480 --> 03:41.471
- Yes, please go.

03:41.550 --> 03:44.941
* A golden thread I spin *

03:46.660 --> 03:51.427
* I dance like this... *

03:51.490 --> 03:53.549
- For how long?

03:55.060 --> 03:57.324
* For me... *

03:57.400 --> 03:58.561
Um...

04:00.800 --> 04:02.461
OK.

04:02.540 --> 04:06.306
* Whoa *

04:07.610 --> 04:09.442
* Whoa *

04:13.580 --> 04:15.275
* Whoa *

04:19.420 --> 04:23.926
* I'll meet with him *

04:25.430 --> 04:27.797
* The last time **

04:31.970 --> 04:33.631
- (Nora and Andrew): Hi!

04:33.700 --> 04:36.465
- Thanks for stopping by!
Come on in!

04:36.540 --> 04:38.429
- We wanted to check
up on your guys!

04:38.510 --> 04:40.103
See how baby April's doing.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.808
See if she's gotten any cuter,
not that that's possible.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.575
- AR

04:44.650 --> 04:47.017
- Josh, Nora, this
is Mark and Wendy.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.969
- We have heard
a lot about you guys.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.587
- Nice to meet you!
- No, no, bring it in for a hug.

04:51.650 --> 04:52.856
Come on, buddy!

04:52.920 --> 04:54.081
So good to meet you guys!

04:54.160 --> 04:55.855
There's nothing
to worry about, buddy.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.979
We're Howlers like you.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.926
- Mark and Wendy
were attacked with us.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.752
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Wow!

05:01.830 --> 05:03.696
- There's nothing
to be sorry about.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.067
There's worse things to be.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.768
(Giggling)

05:06.840 --> 05:08.990
- It's weird though, when
we stumble upon each other.

05:09.070 --> 05:11.129
- Do you stumble
on a lot of us?

05:11.210 --> 05:12.700
- I don't stumble.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.430
I look for
people like us.

05:14.510 --> 05:15.807
We feel it's important

05:15.880 --> 05:17.769
to have a sense
of community.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.443
- No, not always.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.648
- Where'd you find this guy?

05:21.720 --> 05:22.744
(Both laughing)

05:22.820 --> 05:24.140
(Laughing)

05:24.220 --> 05:25.642
- We gotta go.
- Yes, yeah.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.814
- It was so great
seeing the baby!

05:27.890 --> 05:29.380
It was lovely
to meet you guys.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.552
- You too!

05:30.630 --> 05:31.756
- Bye, guys!

05:31.830 --> 05:32.922
- Bye!
- Thanks again!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.490
We'll see you around!
- Sure.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.891
- Let me see her!

05:35.960 --> 05:38.167
Oh my God,
she's so big!

05:38.230 --> 05:40.938
- So, I know Mark's
a little intense,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.503
but he's actually
really sweet.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.731
- Yes.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.471
- Your baby is perfect!
- I know!

05:46.540 --> 05:48.770
- Look at her, oh my gosh!

05:48.840 --> 05:50.569
Uh, here, we got you...

05:50.650 --> 05:51.947
- Open it!

05:52.010 --> 05:54.047
- It's just kind of
a supply grab bag.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.817
- Put together by 2 people
who have no children,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.187
so it's fairly half-assed.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.911
- Why don't you open it?

05:59.990 --> 06:04.086
- Here we go, sweetie. There.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.026
You really didn't
need to do this.

06:06.090 --> 06:08.092
- Oh, we wanted to!

06:09.500 --> 06:12.162
- Oh my gosh!

06:12.230 --> 06:13.493
- A little wolf on it.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.436
- This is adorable!

06:15.500 --> 06:19.539
Thank you so much!
You really... This is...

06:19.610 --> 06:21.169
- Are you OK?

06:21.240 --> 06:24.505
- Things are just
happening really fast.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.115
Just a little...
overwhelmed.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.444
- That's totally
understandable.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.490
- We've been thinking about
having kids for so long.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.688
Just been thinking
about everything

06:35.760 --> 06:37.580
that goes into
being pregnant

06:37.660 --> 06:41.790
and arguing over nursery colours
and organizing a baby shower.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.897
We didn't get to do any of that.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.119
I know, it sounds stupid.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.668
- (Josh and Nora): No, no!

06:46.740 --> 06:48.469
- Not at all!

06:48.540 --> 06:49.803
(Baby babbling)

06:49.870 --> 06:51.838
Why don't you let me
throw you a shower?

06:51.910 --> 06:53.139
- What?

06:53.210 --> 06:54.803
- Yes! I'm throwing
you a shower.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.769
- It's a good idea!
- No!

06:56.850 --> 06:58.841
- No, we've taken
advantage of you already.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.516
- Just give us a couple weeks
to throw it together.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.184
- Seriously?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.888
- Yes, we would love to.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.858
- OK! Thank you!
That'd be great!

07:12.900 --> 07:14.527
- (Nora):
Oh, we're idiots!

07:14.600 --> 07:16.694
We're idiots,
we're idiots, we're idiots!

07:16.770 --> 07:19.068
- Nora, seriously!
It's barely a baby shower.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.861
It's just you, me, alpha Mark
and what's-her-name.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.101
- And her name
is Wendy.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.865
And take it easy on Mark.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.772
- No!
- You've only met him once!

07:26.840 --> 07:27.910
- He's the worst!

07:27.980 --> 07:29.948
He was trying to dominate me!

07:30.010 --> 07:31.739
- No, he wasn't!
- Yes, he was!

07:31.810 --> 07:33.710
- If he tries that here...
- Oh my God!

07:33.780 --> 07:34.713
- What's going on?

07:34.780 --> 07:35.713
- Last minute

07:35.780 --> 07:37.043
werewolf baby shower.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.818
- Well, not exactly last minute.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.881
It's tonight, so...

07:42.960 --> 07:44.724
- That's all right.
I'll clear out.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.724
- No, I was gonna invite you.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.290
- It's OK. I'm
not really up for it.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.523
Nora, actually, have
you talked with Kat?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.898
- Uh, not since
she called to yell at me

07:53.970 --> 07:57.065
and announced that she's
moving out of my apartment.

07:58.870 --> 08:01.100
I think she's broken up
with all of us, Aidan.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.204
(Nora sighing)

08:02.280 --> 08:03.600
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:04.810 --> 08:06.744
Look, I know you're sad, OK?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.811
But I've been thinking
a lot about this

08:08.880 --> 08:16.880
and I want you to look
at it this way:

08:42.419 --> 08:43.909
This is the first time
you've been dumped...

08:43.990 --> 08:45.947
she won't cry before
hanging up the phone.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.910
- Oh, poor lonely boy
and his broken heart.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.151
You're pathetic!

08:50.230 --> 08:52.028
- I know!

08:52.090 --> 08:53.251
- Go see what's-her-name.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.695
- Kick down the door.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.125
- Give her neck
the old snapperoo.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.623
- I mean, that's what
gets you off, right?

08:58.700 --> 09:00.691
That's your--
That's your thing.

09:00.770 --> 09:03.740
- They might have been nice
when they were alive,

09:03.810 --> 09:05.869
but as ghosts, they're
ratched-ass bitches.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.704
They're fine!
- What did you do?

09:07.780 --> 09:10.169
- I banished them
from the house! You're welcome!

09:10.250 --> 09:11.900
- You shouldn't
have done that!

09:11.980 --> 09:13.869
- I couldn't stand
here and watch them

09:13.950 --> 09:15.111
talk to you like that!

09:15.180 --> 09:17.786
- I deserve this.
I really do.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.887
- I guess it doesn't
matter where they are,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.382
because they
couldn't torture you

09:21.460 --> 09:23.019
as much as you
torture yourself!

09:23.090 --> 09:25.787
- You don't understand
what I did, what I am!

09:25.860 --> 09:27.794
That's exactly
what Kat is afraid of.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.294
That is exactly what--

09:30.470 --> 09:31.619
Sally?

09:36.840 --> 09:39.730
- All right, I'm heading out.
Is everything on this list?

09:39.810 --> 09:41.278
- Don't forget the mixed nuts.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.069
- Yeah!
- They're key.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.869
- Can you keep an eye on my
sp--spana--skanakopita?

09:45.950 --> 09:48.339
My, uh, spanako--
spanakopita.

09:48.420 --> 09:52.857
Because phyllo dough
is, like, angel skin.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.115
(Doorbell buzzing)

09:54.190 --> 09:55.851
- Don't say I got
the time wrong.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.921
- No, no.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.921
(Grunting)

10:02.000 --> 10:03.126
- Hey.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.725
- Hi!

10:04.800 --> 10:05.824
(Sighing)

10:05.900 --> 10:07.868
- Guess who's super sober?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.205
(Sighing)

10:14.110 --> 10:15.430
- When did you get out?

10:15.510 --> 10:17.399
- A week and a half ago.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.845
- And you didn't call us?

10:18.910 --> 10:20.674
- I still had
a lot to figure out.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.218
Didn't want to dump that on you,

10:22.280 --> 10:24.089
so I went home
and dumped it on Mom.

10:24.150 --> 10:26.209
- Oh, great! Yeah,
how did that go?

10:26.290 --> 10:28.258
- Well, exactly as well
as you might think.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.788
- Yeah.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.919
- Which is why
I'm here to use you

10:31.990 --> 10:33.424
and your couch.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.026
I just need a place to crash
for a couple of days.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.465
I've got a
studio lined up--

10:37.530 --> 10:39.123
- Of course you're
staying here.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.759
- Thank you.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.968
- After we sprint to
the grocery store real quick.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.769
Do you mind?

10:44.840 --> 10:47.275
- Why am I sprinting?
- We're hosting a baby shower.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.375
- Oh!

10:48.440 --> 10:49.805
- In an hour and a half.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.802
- Oh.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.676
- With champagne.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.371
- We didn't know
you were coming!

10:55.450 --> 10:58.886
- It's OK. It's all good.
I can be around the stuff.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.714
It's a baby shower!

11:00.790 --> 11:03.725
That's a party I can
actually handle. Babies!

11:03.790 --> 11:05.485
- Yeah.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.052
** You told me words *

11:08.130 --> 11:12.124
* That will never expire *

11:14.040 --> 11:16.805
* Watch what my body says *

11:16.870 --> 11:20.408
* When you're caught
being a liar *

11:22.410 --> 11:26.847
*T'll fire words
as staccato sounds *

11:26.920 --> 11:30.185
* Grinding my teeth,
shoulders tightly wound **

11:30.250 --> 11:33.754
- You know, it's a real bad idea
to be following me, Kenny!

11:35.490 --> 11:36.924
(Scoffing, tut-tutting)

11:39.900 --> 11:42.767
- You know, I've been calling
you for over a week now.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.320
Why haven't you
been answering?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.925
- I don't know
where she is.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.832
- What are you talking about?

11:47.900 --> 11:52.133
- The mysterious vampire hunter.
I haven't seen her, all right?

11:52.210 --> 11:54.429
- No, that's...
That's not why I was calling.

11:54.510 --> 11:56.774
I just thought we were...

11:56.850 --> 12:00.047
I don't know,
reconnecting or something.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.440
I just wanted to hang out.

12:02.550 --> 12:05.042
- You caught me on a weird day.

12:06.190 --> 12:08.158
- What is it, junkie stuff?

12:08.220 --> 12:11.155
Roomie stuff?
Romance stuff?

12:13.130 --> 12:14.200
Romance stuff.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.819
- Kat and I broke up.

12:15.900 --> 12:16.867
- So you're what?

12:16.930 --> 12:18.364
You're doing the whole,

12:18.430 --> 12:20.398
"I'm gonna walk around
sad, thinking about her

12:20.470 --> 12:23.030
"while I try not to think
about her," sort of thing?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.306
- What the hell do you
know about it, Kenny?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.872
- Fine, that's a good point.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.578
It's not very easy
to entice a girl

12:28.640 --> 12:31.473
to sit in a hospital and watch
a movie through a glass barrier.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.148
But I have watched
enough television

12:35.220 --> 12:38.190
to know what people deal with
when going through breakups.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.220
- What do people deal with
when going through a breakup?

12:41.290 --> 12:44.555
- Well, I nailed the whole "sad
walk around town," didn't I?

12:44.630 --> 12:46.382
(Scoffing)

12:46.460 --> 12:47.495
Now you got step 2.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.119
- What's step 2?

12:49.200 --> 12:50.998
- Drown your sorrows!

12:51.070 --> 12:53.289
- No, uh-uh. I'm not going
to a blood den, Kenny!

12:53.370 --> 12:54.997
- No, no, no!
You don't have to.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.061
I have got a fridge
packed with bagged stuff.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.029
Just in case you
ever came over.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.432
- Bagged stuff?

13:01.510 --> 13:03.046
- Yes.

13:03.110 --> 13:06.375
(Siren wailing in distance)

13:07.650 --> 13:09.049
Yes!

13:09.120 --> 13:10.042
- Come on!

13:10.120 --> 13:11.485
- OK, I'm coming!

13:15.320 --> 13:17.584
- She's so cute!

13:17.660 --> 13:19.321
Look at those cheekies!

13:19.390 --> 13:21.290
- I know!

13:21.360 --> 13:22.498
- And she's a werewolf?

13:22.560 --> 13:24.494
- Just like the rest of us!

13:26.630 --> 13:30.510
- I didn't mean that
to sound like an insult.

13:30.570 --> 13:35.030
I'm an alcoholic. I have no
idea why I said that either.

13:35.110 --> 13:36.339
- Champagne?

13:36.410 --> 13:37.809
- Yes!

13:38.680 --> 13:40.614
(Knocking on door)

13:40.680 --> 13:44.218
- Josh, there is something
I should tell you. I...

13:44.290 --> 13:45.314
- Hi!
Hey!

13:45.390 --> 13:46.983
- Welcome! Come on in!

13:47.060 --> 13:48.619
Look at
that present!

13:48.690 --> 13:50.055
- (Wendy):
Hi, everybody!

13:50.130 --> 13:52.451
- Wow! You brought
a big, big gift.

13:52.530 --> 13:55.090
- It's just a little something
for the new parents.

13:55.160 --> 14:00.234
- Yeah, and you brought 2 cases
of beer and 2 other couples.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.008
- More on the way.
Nothing to worry about.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.435
They're like us. It's cool.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.205
- Is it though, Mark?

14:06.270 --> 14:08.409
- Of course!
Of course it's cool.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.278
It's, you know,
the more the merrier!

14:10.350 --> 14:13.012
Uh, let's find
a spot in the fridge

14:13.080 --> 14:14.115
for all this beer!

14:15.750 --> 14:17.388
- Do you know these people?

14:17.450 --> 14:18.520
- Not really, no.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.558
- So Mark just
invites them over?

14:20.620 --> 14:23.555
What's that about? Is it
some kind of weird power thing?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.088
- Actually, it's more
like a pack gathering.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.049
And I asked him
to invite them over.

14:28.130 --> 14:30.019
I'm thinking about
joining the pack.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.262
- Whoa, that's
a huge mistake, man!

14:32.330 --> 14:35.038
Things go sideways
real fast in a group.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.034
And now you have
April, it's like...

14:37.110 --> 14:38.430
- Exactly, when
it was just us,

14:38.510 --> 14:40.205
I could tell myself
if we laid low,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.237
stayed under
the vampire radar...

14:42.310 --> 14:44.404
And if something happened,
I would step up.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.142
But I got a kid now,
and that changes everything.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.972
I would give my 2 eyes
to protect her.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.610
Like it or not,
there's safety in numbers.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.079
- But you are safe.
Things are quiet now!

14:54.160 --> 14:56.288
That virus wiped
most of the vampires out!

14:56.360 --> 14:58.454
The ones left are
trying to keep the peace!

14:58.530 --> 14:59.679
Trust me.
I know this!

14:59.760 --> 15:01.489
- They are already growing.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.198
And if they gain force,

15:03.270 --> 15:05.921
how long do you think
that peace will last?

15:07.270 --> 15:08.635
I'm joining the pack, Josh.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.668
And if you cared
about your safety,

15:10.740 --> 15:11.662
Nora's safety,

15:11.740 --> 15:13.378
you would too.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.681
(Doorbell buzzing)

15:26.590 --> 15:28.354
- Hey!
- Hi!

15:31.430 --> 15:33.250
- Hey, you make
the deviled eggs?

15:33.330 --> 15:35.025
- Yeah.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.098
- Perfection.
You are an artist.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.593
- Did someone buy
the baby her first beer bong?

15:42.670 --> 15:44.638
- Hey! Where did you go?

15:44.710 --> 15:48.533
- I just spent, uh,
4 days in 2001.

15:48.610 --> 15:51.580
- 4 days? That's a lot
longer than usual, right?

15:51.650 --> 15:54.176
- Oh, and it's longer
than I would have liked.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.547
I was with 16-year-old you.

15:55.620 --> 15:56.769
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

15:56.850 --> 15:58.648
And 16-year-old Julia.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.417
You were discovering your
bodies for the first time.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.151
- Seriously?

16:03.230 --> 16:06.052
- "Um, I'm ready to
discover your body, Julia."

16:06.130 --> 16:07.154
Those were your words.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.254
- Is that what I said?

16:08.330 --> 16:09.320
- Yeah.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.765
- Is that how
I said it too?

16:10.830 --> 16:13.663
That's interesting that
you watched us having sex.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.334
- If it makes you feel any
better, I was impressed!

16:16.400 --> 16:18.368
- I can't do this
right now!

16:18.440 --> 16:20.272
I have a house
full of wolves.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.536
- All these people are wolves?
- Yeah!

16:22.610 --> 16:24.305
- Good! You should
make friends!

16:26.210 --> 16:28.372
- I mean, he's sweet.
- Is that Emily?

16:28.450 --> 16:31.647
- Yeah, yeah.
Fresh out of rehab.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.210
- Well, good,
she was a mess.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.397
(Guests howling, laughing)

16:43.470 --> 16:46.064
- Hey! How you
holding up?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.200
(Sighing)

16:47.270 --> 16:49.136
- Well, I've had
4 panic attacks,

16:49.200 --> 16:51.669
uh, but otherwise,
I'm rock-and-roll solid.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.230
I'm S O SO I ry I

16:53.310 --> 16:54.436
I didn't mean for this

16:54.510 --> 16:55.500
to turn into The Howling.

16:55.580 --> 16:56.729
- It's not the werewolves.

16:56.810 --> 16:58.300
- It should be
the werewolves.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.541
They're frigging sketchy!

16:59.610 --> 17:01.169
- It's all of the alcohol,

17:01.250 --> 17:03.139
the delicious,
delicious alcohol.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.086
I want to put it
inside of me.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.446
- OK, I'm pulling
the plug.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.589
- No, no!

17:07.660 --> 17:08.582
- I'm gonna do it.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.150
I want them out anyway.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.289
- Josh, I'm not gonna
be that person. It's OK.

17:12.359 --> 17:13.849
- I just wanna
keep you strong.

17:13.930 --> 17:15.853
- I am strong, for real.

17:15.930 --> 17:17.261
(Women laughing)

17:19.270 --> 17:20.635
- Could we keep it reasonable?

17:20.700 --> 17:22.531
There's a baby in
here...somewhere.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.160
- Yeah! Yeah, you
should turn that down.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.435
(Scoffing, sniffling)

17:26.510 --> 17:28.398
- Hey...

17:28.480 --> 17:29.538
- I'm fine.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.669
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go...

17:31.750 --> 17:33.616
- I'm gonna turn down
that music.

17:36.620 --> 17:40.318
- Josh, I think
she's bluffing! Josh!

17:40.390 --> 17:43.223
- Hey, everyone! I'd like
to make a little toast.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.587
I promise it'll be quick.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.628
Uh...

17:46.690 --> 17:49.330
To baby April,

17:49.400 --> 17:53.189
a wolf born not out of
violence, but out of love.

17:53.270 --> 17:56.570
She's a sign of
a happy future,

17:56.640 --> 18:00.133
a future without
fear or violence.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.474
A future where we don't
have to spend our lives

18:02.540 --> 18:04.247
looking over our shoulders,

18:04.310 --> 18:06.142
waiting for a leech
to attack on a whim.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.349
A future where
we're strong.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.641
And I know some of you think
that time has already come,

18:12.720 --> 18:17.226
that the vamps preach
coexistence and, uh, and peace.

18:17.290 --> 18:22.899
No. We know them to be soulless
liars and vicious animals

18:22.960 --> 18:24.325
that have no resp--

18:33.540 --> 18:35.736
(Guests whispering)

18:37.580 --> 18:39.776
- Werewolf dance party!

18:39.850 --> 18:44.720
- All right! Get some!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah!

18:44.790 --> 18:47.213
* Shake it
Let me hear you now *

18:47.290 --> 18:48.758
- Break it down!

18:48.820 --> 18:51.551
(* Trust by Generationals *)

18:51.630 --> 18:54.952
- ** People don't say what
they're covering up *

18:55.030 --> 18:58.330
* And are you staring
at a loaded gun? *

18:58.400 --> 18:59.925
* Are you gonna
give you... *

19:00.000 --> 19:01.536
- I like you happy!

19:01.600 --> 19:02.761
- (Slurring): Hey!

19:02.840 --> 19:03.966
What's not to
be happy about?

19:04.040 --> 19:04.962
I'm eternally young!

19:05.040 --> 19:06.735
I'm devilishly handsome!

19:06.810 --> 19:09.199
And aside from a crippling
addiction to blood,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.203
I'm top-shelf catch, baby!

19:11.280 --> 19:12.543
(Laughing)

19:12.610 --> 19:14.749
And I'm dancing with
a beautiful woman.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.549
- Hmm...

19:16.620 --> 19:18.839
Well, I wish you could
spin me or dip me,

19:18.920 --> 19:22.220
because ghost dancing, not
so much fun as it could be!

19:22.290 --> 19:24.486
- Well, then it looks
like we have no choice!

19:24.560 --> 19:25.857
We'll have to
do the curtain.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.819
- What's that?
- Are you ready for it?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.823
- Of course I am!
- Let's do the curtain!

19:29.900 --> 19:31.459
- Oh my God!

19:31.530 --> 19:36.730
- Whoa! Oh!
Did you see that?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.007
- Yeah! I feel, like,
slightly violated!

19:39.070 --> 19:41.004
- Uh-oh!
- And now it's a party!

19:41.080 --> 19:42.809
- Yeah! Whoo!

19:42.880 --> 19:44.700
- * If you can't see it... *

19:44.780 --> 19:46.874
- What's up?

19:46.950 --> 19:48.748
- * And you're making
it up as you go... *

19:48.820 --> 19:53.360
So, full moon tomorrow.
That's pretty intense, huh?

19:53.420 --> 19:56.879
You got the whole "heightened
sense" thing going on.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.519
- * My friend Olivia **

19:58.590 --> 20:00.251
Sorry to bug you.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.764
- That kid's pushing it.

20:03.830 --> 20:06.595
And please explain to me
how you live with this one.

20:06.670 --> 20:09.594
- Well, it's a pretty
simple explanation, Mark.

20:09.670 --> 20:10.660
I just do.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.765
Aidan's like
a brother to me.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.035
- That's some
family you have.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.406
- What about Kenny?
Isn't he, like, their king?

20:18.480 --> 20:19.675
- I vouch for Aidan.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.616
If he vouches for him,
then it's cool.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.990
And I'm 80% sure they
don't use the term "king."

20:24.050 --> 20:25.643
- I got a term for them.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.313
- You know what, Mark?

20:27.390 --> 20:29.415
If you've got such
a problem with my friends,

20:29.490 --> 20:31.982
why don't you take all
these uninvited people

20:32.060 --> 20:33.653
and get the hell
out of my house?

20:33.730 --> 20:35.755
(* Rock *)

20:35.830 --> 20:36.854
- We'll stay.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.571
(Sighing)

20:54.050 --> 20:55.370
- You're OK.

20:55.450 --> 20:56.474
(Sighing)

20:56.550 --> 20:57.711
You're OK.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.582
You're gonna be OK.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.021
You knew coming here
would be weird.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.892
(Sniffling)

21:11.100 --> 21:12.499
You can deal.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.068
I should just call my sponsor.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.575
- Yeah, yeah, you should
call your sponsor.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.630
(Scoffing)

21:22.710 --> 21:24.405
- What do you say?

21:24.480 --> 21:26.505
"Hey! I'm at a
werewolf baby shower

21:26.580 --> 21:28.378
"thrown by my werewolf brother,

21:28.450 --> 21:30.817
"and I'm jonesing
for a vodka-cranberry."

21:30.890 --> 21:34.087
- OK, Emily, normally
I would ask your permission,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.787
but you can't hear me,

21:35.860 --> 21:37.919
so that's why I'm about
to put a spell on you

21:37.990 --> 21:39.685
where you can
hear me and see me.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.659
OK.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.498
(Whispering in Latin)

21:56.740 --> 21:59.903
Can you not
see me or hear me?

22:04.890 --> 22:06.949
How did that not work?

22:11.090 --> 22:12.956
(* Jazz *)

22:23.910 --> 22:25.765
(Laughing)

22:25.840 --> 22:28.810
OK, so, something about
that spell worked.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.902
- That place is
the cat's pyjamas!

22:32.980 --> 22:35.813
- Stick with us, kid!
We know all the hot spots.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.109
Ain't that right, Aidan?

22:37.180 --> 22:38.989
- Whatever you say, fella!

22:39.050 --> 22:41.917
Whatever you say.
- Well, why are we leaving?

22:41.990 --> 22:44.027
- Whoa! Aidan Capone!

22:44.090 --> 22:47.458
- I wanna keep dancing!
The band was on fire!

22:47.530 --> 22:49.999
- I don't care about
the band or the dancing.

22:50.060 --> 22:50.993
- Oh!

22:51.070 --> 22:52.663
- I just wanna be with you.

22:52.730 --> 22:55.199
- Oh, I see! So, where
are you taking us?

22:55.270 --> 22:56.431
A necking party?

22:56.500 --> 22:57.433
(Laughing)

22:57.510 --> 22:58.659
- Sure!

22:58.740 --> 23:00.799
You can call it
a necking party.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.441
- Right this way, my dear!

23:06.950 --> 23:08.645
- This can't end well.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.018
(Women laughing)

23:19.960 --> 23:21.792
You'd get in a fight
with a vampire,

23:21.860 --> 23:23.225
and the stakes would go away,

23:23.300 --> 23:26.224
and then front kicks
and sweepings of the legs.

23:26.300 --> 23:29.235
There he is! There's
the man of the hour.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.802
Good to see you!

23:30.870 --> 23:32.907
- It's good to see
you too! Are you having fun?

23:32.970 --> 23:35.177
- Hell yeah!
- Yeah, good times!

23:35.240 --> 23:38.141
Why didn't you say you were
having a full-blown party?

23:38.210 --> 23:40.008
- Well, because
I wasn't intending

23:40.080 --> 23:41.570
to have a full-blown party.

23:41.650 --> 23:43.880
Andrew actually invited
the pack here, so...

23:43.950 --> 23:46.544
You didn't mention that
you'd crash with a plus-one.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.610
No offense.

23:47.690 --> 23:48.816
- I can explain.

23:48.890 --> 23:49.812
We were at Kenny's,

23:49.890 --> 23:51.119
it was cool, then oops!

23:51.190 --> 23:52.988
I dranked all
the bagged blood.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.494
(Laughing)

23:54.560 --> 23:55.857
It's not a big deal.
It's fine.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.591
We were just
gonna come back here.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.490
We were just gonna
get some refills.

23:59.570 --> 24:00.992
- Are you OK?

24:01.070 --> 24:01.992
- Yeah!

24:02.070 --> 24:03.560
- What's going on?

24:03.640 --> 24:05.199
I've never seen you
like this before.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.965
- No, I'm good.
I'm totally fine.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.269
- How much
have you had?

24:08.340 --> 24:10.206
- I don't know,
Mom, a ton?

24:10.280 --> 24:11.839
God, Josh!
- Hey, hey!

24:11.910 --> 24:13.742
I don't want things
to get out of hand.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.914
- It's gonna get out
of hand! Put it up!

24:16.980 --> 24:18.618
Down low.
It's cool!

24:18.690 --> 24:20.715
Hey, you're not the
only one that needs

24:20.790 --> 24:22.781
to howl at the moon
every now and then!

24:22.860 --> 24:25.124
You know what? I've been
through enough lately.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.487
Do I need a lecture?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.794
Buddy, seriously though,
I think maybe he's right.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.668
Maybe we should go.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.295
- Well, wait a second. Come on.

24:35.370 --> 24:38.237
Get that... Get that
buzzkill out of your mind.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.209
- I'm just...

24:41.280 --> 24:44.306
(* Butterflies by Belasco *)

24:44.380 --> 24:48.817
<i>** 1 cut the wings
off an angel's *</i>

24:48.880 --> 24:53.556
* Butterfly, I hope
she cries for you and I *

24:53.620 --> 24:56.214
* Life is hard
Do or die *

24:56.290 --> 24:57.849
* Ain't got *

24:58.990 --> 25:00.253
* Nothing left **

25:01.960 --> 25:04.725
I'm just not
feeling it anymore.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.666
You know what?
Look at these people.

25:06.730 --> 25:08.198
- Mm-hmm.
- Look at the couples.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.261
Every one of them is a monster.

25:10.340 --> 25:14.072
Every one of them is as
dangerous and damaged as I am.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.131
But they get love.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.304
They get to be with
someone. What do I get?

25:18.380 --> 25:20.007
Well, hmm...

25:20.080 --> 25:21.616
Glad you asked me, son.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.149
I get to either be
with someone like me,

25:24.220 --> 25:25.779
and that ends in disaster,

25:25.850 --> 25:27.181
(Imitates explosion)

25:27.250 --> 25:30.823
Or I get to be alone
or I get to live a lie.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.153
Those are
my choices, right?

25:32.230 --> 25:35.757
- What, you don't want
me to compel you? Hmm?

25:35.830 --> 25:37.992
I will do it!
- No, I don't.

25:38.070 --> 25:42.132
However, what if you
got specific, surgical,

25:42.200 --> 25:44.862
and just pluck a memory
out of my brain?

25:44.940 --> 25:46.032
Could you do that?

25:46.110 --> 25:47.839
You know, like
you were saying.

25:47.910 --> 25:50.333
Could you wipe a person from
my mind? Could you do that?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.674
- Probably. I mean,
I am pretty awesome.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.310
- Well, then that's it.
That's what we're gonna do.

25:55.380 --> 25:58.315
We're just gonna go in and we
are going to erase Kat from my--

25:58.390 --> 26:00.188
It's, like, I never met her.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.218
And that's what
we're gonna do, Kenny.

26:02.290 --> 26:03.382
(Sniffling)

26:03.460 --> 26:04.825
Kenny?

26:04.890 --> 26:06.881
- Kenny.
- Astrid.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.849
- Oh my God!

26:10.430 --> 26:12.319
(* Jazz *)

26:14.040 --> 26:16.031
Tell me something.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.809
Is this not one of
the most beautiful evenings

26:19.870 --> 26:21.634
that you've ever seen?

26:21.710 --> 26:24.407
- One of the most beautiful
moustaches I've ever seen!

26:24.480 --> 26:26.847
Oh man, I can't wait
to bust your balls

26:26.910 --> 26:28.969
about this pervy
John Waters look, you perv!

26:29.050 --> 26:30.814
- Where is this
joint, anyway?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.289
I hate this neighbourhood!

26:32.350 --> 26:33.317
- It's tucked away

26:33.390 --> 26:34.687
so the fuzz can't see it.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.355
- Yeah, um, uh...

26:38.430 --> 26:40.125
Well...

26:40.190 --> 26:42.124
What do
you think?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.725
- I think you're
a real boob!

26:43.800 --> 26:44.722
- Wait a second!

26:44.800 --> 26:46.620
- Where's the party at?

26:48.340 --> 26:50.399
- Don't do this, Aidan.
This is not you!

26:50.470 --> 26:52.905
- I assure you, the
party is right here.

26:52.970 --> 26:54.301
- Don't make me fireball you!

26:56.440 --> 26:59.080
Oh God, magic
doesn't work here!

27:01.180 --> 27:03.274
(Women screaming)

27:03.350 --> 27:04.943
- Aidan!
- Shhh!

27:05.020 --> 27:06.112
(Screaming)

27:06.190 --> 27:09.057
- Please! Please! Please!

27:09.120 --> 27:13.057
- Aidan, don't!
- Please, please! Are you done?

27:13.130 --> 27:14.996
- Aidan!

27:15.060 --> 27:15.993
(Screaming)

27:16.060 --> 27:17.130
(Moaning)

27:19.370 --> 27:22.795
- What do we have here? Dessert?

27:22.870 --> 27:24.269
(Whimpering)

27:28.540 --> 27:29.769
(Breathing heavily)

27:29.840 --> 27:32.070
- ** Ain't she sweet... *

27:32.150 --> 27:33.447
Dibs.

27:33.510 --> 27:36.810
* She's walking
down the street *

27:36.880 --> 27:38.939
* So I ask you
very confidentially... *

27:39.020 --> 27:40.146
- You gotta run!

27:40.220 --> 27:42.780
- * Ain't she sweet? *

27:42.860 --> 27:45.124
* Ain't she nice? *

27:45.190 --> 27:48.797
* Looked her over
once or twice *

27:48.860 --> 27:51.067
* Yes, I asked you
very conf-- **

27:51.130 --> 27:52.359
- Aidan!

27:54.900 --> 27:56.436
- This is awkward.

27:58.270 --> 28:00.432
I'm afraid you must
have me mistaken

28:00.510 --> 28:02.171
for someone else,

28:02.240 --> 28:04.846
for as you can surely see,
madam, I am the devil.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.809
- No!

28:07.880 --> 28:09.314
(Both grunting)

28:10.420 --> 28:12.286
(Screaming)

28:12.350 --> 28:13.442
(Gasping)

28:13.520 --> 28:15.852
- Hey, Henry!

28:15.920 --> 28:20.426
Oh, this old bird's tough,
but she's worth the work!

28:20.490 --> 28:23.926
(Both laughing)

28:32.140 --> 28:34.006
- There she is!

28:34.080 --> 28:36.378
Hey, sweetheart,
first you bail on me,

28:36.440 --> 28:39.478
and then Kenny wanders off,
and I have no idea where he--

28:39.550 --> 28:41.473
Are you OK?

28:41.550 --> 28:43.882
- Yeah, I was in the '20s.

28:43.950 --> 28:44.940
- No way! The '20s!

28:45.020 --> 28:46.545
That's some good music,

28:46.620 --> 28:48.156
and the speakeasies!

28:48.220 --> 28:49.517
- Something's not right!

28:49.590 --> 28:51.080
When I use the magic,

28:51.160 --> 28:52.924
I'm gone a few minutes,
maybe an hour.

28:52.990 --> 28:55.550
But tonight, 2 days,
and now 2 weeks.

28:55.630 --> 28:57.394
- Oh my God, quantum leap!

28:57.460 --> 29:01.340
- Aidan, just listen! What
if I can't get myself out?

29:01.400 --> 29:03.198
I can't use spells there.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.261
What if I'm
stuck there forever?

29:05.340 --> 29:08.435
- OK, listen. I don't care
about time travel or magic.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.069
I just wanna get with you.

29:12.510 --> 29:14.547
That was awkward.
- I'm gonna walk off now.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.247
Yeah, away...
from you.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.242
- OK.

29:32.430 --> 29:35.468
- Hey, Aidan's
inappropriately young friend!

29:35.540 --> 29:38.601
Do your parents even care
that you're going to strip clubs

29:38.670 --> 29:40.604
and getting hammered
with werewolves?

29:40.670 --> 29:42.479
Do you even have parents?

29:42.540 --> 29:46.101
- It's not for me. It's for
a girl, a very pretty girl.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.341
Her name is Astrid.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.048
- Of course it is.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.986
- Astrid, there's
no more ale.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.382
Do you want a lager instead?
- Sure.

29:53.450 --> 29:56.488
- All right,
lager it is.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.120
- Oh my God! Your face!

29:59.190 --> 30:02.558
- No, no, no! It's OK, it's OK!
Just look at me! Look at me!

30:02.630 --> 30:04.359
Listen to me!
- Josh, help!

30:04.430 --> 30:07.491
- Hey! What the hell's going on?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

30:07.570 --> 30:11.063
- His face... I didn't know what
he was. I don't know what he is!

30:11.140 --> 30:12.210
- What were you doing?

30:12.270 --> 30:13.362
- I was getting a beer.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.635
That's it. I promise.

30:14.710 --> 30:16.269
- But you don't
drink beer, do you?

30:16.340 --> 30:17.501
- Hey! Leave him alone.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.650
- Stay out of this.

30:18.710 --> 30:20.303
- It's a misunderstanding.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.518
Let's hear him out, OK?

30:21.580 --> 30:23.218
- We know what he was up to.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.987
- Everybody,
just calm down, OK?

30:25.050 --> 30:27.246
- I think we should
get the baby some place safe.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.879
- I wasn't
gonna drink her, OK?

30:28.960 --> 30:30.257
- What?
- I swear.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.186
- Someone get something
sharp and wooden.

30:33.430 --> 30:34.454
- Get off me!
- Hey!

30:34.530 --> 30:36.225
- Josh, you gotta hear me out.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.324
(Both grunting)

30:37.400 --> 30:39.164
(Bone cracking,
screaming)

30:39.230 --> 30:40.265
- Kenny!

30:42.200 --> 30:43.599
(Both grunting)

30:43.670 --> 30:45.263
No!

30:46.740 --> 30:48.208
(Grunting)

30:50.580 --> 30:51.604
- No, I got this!

30:52.710 --> 30:54.519
(Both grunting)

30:54.580 --> 30:56.412
(Both grunting)

30:56.480 --> 30:58.448
- (Josh):
Aidan, stop!

30:58.520 --> 31:01.353
(Both grunting)

31:02.590 --> 31:04.649
Aidan, get him!

31:04.730 --> 31:07.358
- No, no, no, no, no!

31:07.430 --> 31:09.398
- I didn't even do anything!

31:09.460 --> 31:11.167
- (Aidan): Come on!
- Sorry!

31:11.230 --> 31:12.561
(Groaning)

31:14.170 --> 31:15.990
(Breathing heavily)

31:18.770 --> 31:22.377
- That kid is supposed
to represent the peace?

31:22.440 --> 31:26.570
- It was a mistake, Mark!
Kenny wasn't gonna do anything!

31:26.650 --> 31:29.620
- He's a time bomb, Josh.
And you know it.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.341
- Caroline, don't.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.616
- I'm sorry, Josh, but
after what happened here,

31:33.690 --> 31:36.318
it's pretty obvious
we need to stick together.

31:36.390 --> 31:37.357
- Let's go.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.649
- Andrew...

31:41.630 --> 31:43.029
(Sobbing)

31:46.170 --> 31:48.093
(Insects chirping)

31:50.540 --> 31:51.939
- Is Emily OK?

31:54.810 --> 31:56.733
- I don't know.
I really don't.

31:56.810 --> 31:59.279
- Josh, I have to
tell you something.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.978
(Inhaling deeply)

32:02.050 --> 32:05.418
- It was you, wasn't it? You
did--you did something to her.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.083
You made her see something?

32:07.150 --> 32:08.686
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.649
- I'm really sorry.
She was so alone.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.427
I wanted her to see me.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.197
I wanted her to speak to me.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.694
(Inhaling deeply)

32:17.100 --> 32:18.226
- OK.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.529
- Please don't
walk away.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.238
- I don't understand.
- I'm sorry!

32:21.300 --> 32:23.496
I wanted to help! She
needed somebody to talk to.

32:23.570 --> 32:26.130
- I know your intentions
were good. I'm sure,

32:26.210 --> 32:28.406
They always are, but...

32:28.480 --> 32:32.269
Let's just forget
the deep, deep damage

32:32.350 --> 32:34.375
that you leave behind.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.111
(Sighing)

32:36.180 --> 32:38.387
It's not all you.
It's just, it's...

32:39.850 --> 32:41.454
It's been a long night.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.758
I'm gonna go to bed.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.128
- I can help her.
I can help Emily.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.455
- How?

32:49.530 --> 32:51.259
- I know that
I have to be careful

32:51.330 --> 32:52.559
about how
I use the magic,

32:52.630 --> 32:55.133
because there are
growing consequences.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.339
But there are spells
that I can try on Emily,

32:57.400 --> 32:58.538
spells that curb cravings

32:58.610 --> 33:01.602
or to make her
forget about tonight.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.307
I owe her that.

33:04.410 --> 33:06.071
- After everything...

33:08.180 --> 33:10.740
I-I'm gonna
call it a night.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.051
- Hey.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.190
- Hey.

33:17.260 --> 33:18.523
- How's Emily?

33:18.590 --> 33:20.684
- Oh God! Um...

33:22.230 --> 33:23.220
White-knuckled?

33:23.300 --> 33:24.324
(Sighing)

33:24.400 --> 33:26.198
- Is there anything I can do?

33:26.270 --> 33:30.389
- Yeah, you can lay here
and feel useless with me.

33:30.470 --> 33:31.631
(Sighing)

33:31.710 --> 33:32.734
- God, what a night!

33:32.810 --> 33:34.278
- Mmm, tell me about it.

33:34.340 --> 33:36.229
(Sighing)

33:36.310 --> 33:39.610
- I was just thinking
about Andrew and Caroline

33:39.680 --> 33:41.648
and the whole pack thing.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.113
I get it.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.452
They want their
baby to be safe.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.124
<i>- I know.</i>

33:51.190 --> 33:55.195
If we had a kid, I would
do anything to protect him.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.225
- Yeah, it's important to...

34:01.700 --> 34:04.067
feel like you
belong somewhere...

34:05.540 --> 34:07.668
have that,
you know, strength...

34:08.880 --> 34:10.632
that you get with family.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.806
- We have a family, though...

34:16.219 --> 34:18.813
Aidan, Sally, Emily.

34:20.550 --> 34:22.813
They're beyond dysfunctional

34:22.889 --> 34:27.452
and I wanna smother them
with a pillow half the time,

34:27.530 --> 34:29.418
but they're our family.

34:31.429 --> 34:33.467
- You know what I mean.

34:33.530 --> 34:34.793
- Yeah.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.301
Good night!

34:43.480 --> 34:44.800
- Good night.

34:46.750 --> 34:51.380
(Siren wailing in distance)

34:51.449 --> 34:53.543
** Cut your cards *

34:53.620 --> 34:58.729
* Burn the letters
you were given *

34:58.790 --> 35:02.226
* In every word,
they swore... *

35:02.300 --> 35:04.268
- Kat, I need to talk--

35:04.330 --> 35:06.298
- No! Stop it,
you're scaring me!

35:06.370 --> 35:07.963
- We need to talk.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.465
- Come inside.

35:12.540 --> 35:15.874
* And children... *

35:15.940 --> 35:17.578
- I love you.

35:18.810 --> 35:21.450
And I need you to love me.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.779
- I love you, Aidan.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.342
- Forever.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.479
I want you to
be with me forever.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.860
- Of course. Forever.

35:32.930 --> 35:35.649
* Then you would howl *

35:35.730 --> 35:39.769
* Down that road *

35:39.830 --> 35:43.539
* Where all your brothers *

35:43.600 --> 35:48.470
* And your sisters wouldn't go *

35:48.540 --> 35:51.976
* Dream of girls *

35:52.050 --> 35:57.580
* That made you feel 15 *

35:57.650 --> 36:00.517
* With the palest skin *

36:00.590 --> 36:04.288
* And her mother's sympathy *

36:04.360 --> 36:08.524
* But that trail
remains unseen **

36:19.340 --> 36:23.709
-I am. I'm...
gonna crash with a friend.

36:23.780 --> 36:25.748
- You know, you don't
have to leave.

36:25.810 --> 36:28.245
- Yeah, I--I kind of do.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.015
- Listen, last
night, it--it--

36:30.080 --> 36:32.310
That kind of thing
never happens!

36:32.390 --> 36:33.516
It's not like that!

36:33.590 --> 36:36.389
It rarely
happens here.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.349
- Maybe so, but...

36:39.990 --> 36:43.756
Look, it--it's like every time
I'm around, things go haywire.

36:43.830 --> 36:45.696
And there was a time where,

36:45.770 --> 36:48.762
I don't know, I might
have rolled with that,

36:48.840 --> 36:50.899
but--but now I've
gotta admit to myself,

36:50.970 --> 36:52.734
I'm too fragile
to roll with anything.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.529
- I knew it. I knew as soon
as you found out about me.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.578
I knew it would
eventually push you away.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.573
- Josh...

36:59.710 --> 37:01.542
I love you.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.419
And I'll love you
no matter what you are.

37:04.490 --> 37:07.585
But this is
about me, what I am.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.456
- OK.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.290
- This isn't goodbye.
- I know.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.435
- Goodbye.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.535
(Laughing)

37:36.880 --> 37:38.075
(Aidan sighing)

37:41.120 --> 37:45.921
- Wow! How has Josh not
freaked out and cleaned up yet?

37:45.990 --> 37:47.685
(Sniffing)

37:47.760 --> 37:49.956
- He's dealing
with Emily stuff.

37:52.170 --> 37:56.368
- Oh! Right,
yeah. Is she OK?

37:56.440 --> 37:58.363
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.568
- Do you have, like,
a cleaning spell?

38:00.640 --> 38:04.372
You know, maybe get, like, a
broom to dance across the floor.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.077
- Yeah, you know,

38:06.150 --> 38:08.949
I'm really gonna try to pick
my spots with the magic stuff.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.079
I'm afraid of getting
stuck in the past

38:11.150 --> 38:12.811
and witnessing terrible stuff,

38:12.890 --> 38:15.018
like my friends
murdering innocent people

38:15.090 --> 38:16.057
like it's a game.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.525
- Hold on,

38:18.590 --> 38:20.388
you said something
about the '20s,

38:20.460 --> 38:22.349
that you were
with me in the '20s.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.057
Were you with me in the '20s?

38:25.670 --> 38:27.092
Oh no!

38:27.170 --> 38:29.798
No, Sally, that was
just such a long time ago!

38:29.870 --> 38:32.362
- You were laughing
while you did it!

38:32.440 --> 38:34.329
One time you were singing!

38:35.440 --> 38:36.976
I always knew you killed, Aidan.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.702
I just had no idea
how much you enjoyed it.

38:39.780 --> 38:43.410
I could have told you that last
night, but you didn't care.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.790
You were just trying
to "get with me."

38:45.850 --> 38:47.113
- Oh!

38:47.190 --> 38:48.954
- I could really
milk this, you know.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.455
I could make you cringe
whenever I wanted to!

38:51.530 --> 38:52.725
- Yes, you could.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.997
- I'm gonna give you
a pass, though,

38:55.060 --> 38:58.394
because you're going
through a rough patch.

38:58.470 --> 39:02.759
But honestly, Aidan, after
spending time with the old you,

39:02.840 --> 39:06.538
I wonder if you don't deserve
to go through this pain.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.907
More, even.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.802
(Sighing)

39:09.880 --> 39:12.872
I don't like when
you lose control.

39:12.950 --> 39:15.578
- Look, you have
to know that that...

39:17.020 --> 39:19.114
it isn't who I am.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.817
That guy from the past --

39:20.890 --> 39:22.710
that guy from last night --

39:22.790 --> 39:24.451
that--that isn't me.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.680
(Sighs)

39:26.760 --> 39:28.819
- I always wondered
why you tried so hard

39:28.900 --> 39:30.459
to do the right thing.

39:30.530 --> 39:33.693
Now I know what you were
trying to make up for.

39:36.570 --> 39:38.607
You're a good man.

39:39.940 --> 39:41.476
Please stay that way.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.507
(Car horns honking)

39:47.580 --> 39:49.912
(* Autumn All the Time
by Sugarplastic *)

39:49.980 --> 39:53.746
** I said hello to you *

39:57.060 --> 39:59.757
* It's all or nothing **

40:01.130 --> 40:03.849
- (Kenny): Hey!
- Hey!

40:03.930 --> 40:06.024
- Hair of the dog?
- Um...

40:06.100 --> 40:08.159
- Wait, that's not
offensive, is it?

40:08.230 --> 40:09.698
- I'm not sure.

40:09.770 --> 40:11.829
- It looks like
the night worked out

40:11.910 --> 40:13.162
for some of us.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.504
- Oh, uh, Astrid, Aidan.
Aidan, Astrid.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.900
- Hey!
- Hi!

40:16.980 --> 40:19.142
What about every other night?

40:19.210 --> 40:21.042
Are you ready for
the flack you'll catch

40:21.110 --> 40:22.180
from both sides?

40:22.250 --> 40:23.615
- Well, Astrid's above

40:23.680 --> 40:24.943
all that gang war stuff.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.217
Besides, she's worth
the flack.

40:28.290 --> 40:30.850
Anyways, um,
you know the memory thing?

40:30.920 --> 40:33.059
I can still do that,
if you really want to.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.690
You know, wipe Kat
right out of your head?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.819
- Uh, thank you, I'm good.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.789
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40:39.870 --> 40:42.032
I think this breakup...

40:43.940 --> 40:47.729
Well, it's the cleanest split
that I've ever had.

40:47.810 --> 40:50.507
I mean, no one disappeared,

40:50.580 --> 40:53.709
no one died
or turned to dust.

40:53.780 --> 40:55.714
You know, it's just normal...

40:55.780 --> 40:56.941
(Snickers)

40:57.020 --> 40:59.182
...human.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.560
- You were in_
a lot of pain last night.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.179
- Yeah.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.683
And I think I need to
carry that pain around with me,

41:05.760 --> 41:06.750
for a little while.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.960
- Yeah.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.668
I just hope it's not too chilly
in the morning, you know?

41:20.740 --> 41:21.969
Hey...

41:22.040 --> 41:23.906
Is--is this
the worst idea ever?

41:23.980 --> 41:25.709
I mean, what are
we doing?

41:25.780 --> 41:27.544
I mean, should we leave?

41:27.610 --> 41:30.944
