00:03.712 --> 00:05.631
STEVE: You know that
printing press that makes our calendars?

00:05.631 --> 00:07.799
I bought it! I have big plans
for the calendars.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.595
- We're being sued
for racially discriminatory practices.

00:11.595 --> 00:15.057
This guy says that we turned him away
for not having a VIP card.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.808
- It's not true. Are you serious?

00:16.808 --> 00:19.478
There are no VIP cards.
They do not exist.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.479
IRENE:
I don't know which is worse,

00:20.479 --> 00:23.440
what you did or the fact
that you lied about it!

00:23.440 --> 00:25.150
- Chippendales is gonna be

00:25.150 --> 00:27.402
on The Phil Donahue Show.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.865
- Please welcome Mr. Chippendales himself,
Mr. Nick De Noia.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.825
STEVE: I forbid you from going
on national television

00:33.825 --> 00:35.369
to take credit for my creation.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.579
- Is that what I'm doing, Steve?
I'm stealing credit?

00:37.579 --> 00:38.914
- That is exactly what you are doing!

00:38.914 --> 00:40.457
- You wanna see taking credit, asshole?

00:40.457 --> 00:42.626
I will show you taking credit.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.546
STEVE: You know, most parents
would be extremely proud of me.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.421

Maybe next time, fellas, maybe.

03:08.814 --> 03:09.606
Sage!

03:09.606 --> 03:10.858
- Hi!
- I told you.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.319
What do you think?
- Bravo.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.904
NICK: Ah, you're too kind.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.489
- Oh, my God, that was so good.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.283
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart. Mwah.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.828
- Nick De Noia, you have
outdone yourself yet again.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.371
- Well, if you like that,
wait till you see

03:24.371 --> 03:25.747
what I cooked up for the closer.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.499
You ain't seeing nothing yet.
- Well done!

03:27.499 --> 03:29.960
Keep it up and I might have
to give you a pay raise.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.712

03:33.088 --> 03:34.965
Steve Banerjee.
CALVIN: Calvin Klein.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.093
- I'm a great admirer of your success
in the business world.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.929
And, Ms. Shields,
your advertising campaign

03:40.929 --> 03:43.056
for Mr. Klein's jeans, oh,

03:43.056 --> 03:45.517
those jeans look wonderful on you.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.604
- Settle down, Steve. [laughs]

03:48.604 --> 03:51.148
Steve is, uh... what would you
call yourself, Steve?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.524
- Oh, you know what you would call me.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.235
- I know what I would call you.
- Yes. [laughs]

03:55.235 --> 03:56.778
Come on, you remember my title.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.530
- Why don't you tell them, Steve?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.075
- I am the owner and creator
of Chippendales.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.410
- Oh.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.624
It's a great show.
BOTH: Thank you.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.793
- It really was.
BOTH: Thank you.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.883
NICK: God, I've had it!

04:17.883 --> 04:19.760
That's the third fucking time in a month.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.303
- Well, why'd he say
he was here this time?

04:21.303 --> 04:22.387
- He didn't.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.140
Stopped even bothering to make excuses.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.809
- It's really sad, the insecurity.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.602
- I know.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.188
- Oh, did I tell you
about Valerie Bertinelli last weekend?

04:31.188 --> 04:32.648
- Oh God, what?

04:32.648 --> 04:34.775
- So, she and I are in the VIP,

04:34.775 --> 04:38.445
and we're, you know, partying,
and, uh, and who comes in?

04:38.445 --> 04:42.866
"Oh, oh, Miss Bertinelli,
I, I am a big fan of you

04:42.866 --> 04:46.328
and your hit CBS
television comedy program."

04:46.328 --> 04:48.997
- Oh, my God, it's fucking mortifying.
[woman giggling]

04:48.997 --> 04:50.541
- Very sad.
- Oh, my God!

04:50.541 --> 04:51.959
Nick De Noia!

04:51.959 --> 04:54.628
- Hey, Mr. Chippendale.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.046
- Well, hello.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.841
[woman laughing]
WOMAN: Oh, my God!

05:00.217 --> 05:03.637
[pedestrians murmuring]

05:05.347 --> 05:07.933
- This is my fucking moment.
Don't you see it?

05:07.933 --> 05:09.309
- Nick.
- You cannot.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.395
- I am a brand now, people will follow.

05:11.395 --> 05:14.147
I launch U.S. Male,
they will follow me there.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.108
DENISE: Why?
- Why?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.609
DENISE: Yes, why?

05:17.609 --> 05:20.821
Why now when you're
finally making money,

05:20.821 --> 05:22.030
you're the toast of the town?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.491
- Because I can't fucking stand the guy.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.161
- Well, so he drops in a few times
a month, uninvited,

05:28.161 --> 05:29.913
and makes you miserable.
NICK: Mm.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.290
Mm!
- You know, my brother, Eddie,

05:31.290 --> 05:32.624
does the same exact thing.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.918
- You know, Otis was right.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.379
Three thousand miles,
not nearly far enough.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.174
[Nick sighs]
- What about 10,000 miles?

05:41.884 --> 05:44.636
- What?
BRADFORD: Or 20,000 miles?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.764
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, what are you talking about?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.474
- I'm talking about a tour.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.186
A Chippendales tour.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.023
DENISE: That's actually
not a terrible idea, Bradford.

05:56.023 --> 05:56.690
BRADFORD: Thank you.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.776
Yeah, you know,
it's a different city every night.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.237
- Not a Banerjee in sight.
[Bradford chuckles]

06:02.237 --> 06:04.698
- I have a friend who used to manage
the road company of Evita,

06:04.698 --> 06:07.201
and he said it was heaven.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.410
The theater takes care of everything.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.412
They put you at the nicest hotels.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.580
They--
DENISE: They pay for your dinner.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.166
- Yes, they take you to dinner.
They're flying you first class.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.293
They treat you like kings, Nick.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.878
DENISE: And we would still have
the New York office.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.421
We could come and go as we please.
BRADFORD: Yeah.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.883
- A little west coast tour here,
a European leg there.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.470
- Yeah, it'd be like having
a country house to escape to.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.139
- Except the country house is
the whole fucking world.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.768
[chuckles]
You're kind of smart.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.478
- Yeah, I am.
[Denise chuckles]

06:37.564 --> 06:39.483
CHERYL: What are you doing? I mean--
- IRENE: I know.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.277
- Hi.
- We have a problem.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.446
[bag thuds]
- Hello, Cheryl.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.032
What is your problem?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.534
- Well, in a word, you.

06:48.534 --> 06:49.868
- You missed your deposition.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.371
- I tried, but my flight was canceled.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.622
I told you--
CHERYL: Uh, you shouldn't have been

06:53.622 --> 06:54.957
in New York in the first place.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.792
Not six weeks before trial.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.043
- I had business to attend to.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.295
- More important than
the 13 people suing you

07:00.295 --> 07:01.338
for racial discrimination?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.715
- Thirteen?
- Yeah, two more just joined.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.466
Mazel.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.596
- This is just a blatant money grab.
- No, this is a class-action lawsuit.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.098
- You have to take this seriously, Steve.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.391
This could destroy us financially.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.143
- Cases like this,
damages can run into the millions.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.855
- And we don't have enough cash reserves
to sustain a hit like that.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.648
- Revenue has never been higher.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.191
IRENE: And neither have expenses.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.944
The renovations,
the constant trips to New York,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.946
the fines, the overcrowding, the--

07:26.738 --> 07:28.407
Oh God, the blocked exits.

07:28.824 --> 07:32.327
We are single-handedly keeping
the LAFD in business.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.121
- I mean, you're their number one donor.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.708
- I can think of one major expense
we could get rid of.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.002
CHERYL: Hey, I am the best money
that you ever spent.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.087
Certainly better than
your fucking humidor.

07:42.087 --> 07:45.007
- Oh, you mean the centerpiece
of our soon-to-open VIP section?

07:45.007 --> 07:47.926
- Who is smoking cigars here?
- Nobody yet 'cause it's not open.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.637
But once it opens,
it's an option for people to have.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.889
CHERYL: Are you kidding?
IRENE: Steve!

07:53.515 --> 07:54.725
I ran the numbers.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.145
If we lose this case,

07:58.145 --> 08:00.606
we don't have sufficient working capital
to maintain operations.

08:00.606 --> 08:01.815
We're gonna lose the club.

DARRELL [over phone]:
Oh, hey. Good, you're there.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.765
So, time's getting tight and--
STEVE: Who is this?

08:35.432 --> 08:37.226
DARRELL:
Darrell, from the print shop.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.603
I've been calling and calling.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.231
I really need your sign-off
on those proofs.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.942
STEVE: I'm busy,
can't you just sign it yourself?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.818
DARRELL:
Uh, it really needs to be your signature.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.403
STEVE: Okay, fine, I'll be there tomorrow.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.905
DARRELL:
Yeah? Great!

08:49.905 --> 08:51.281

09:09.049 --> 09:10.217
Check it out.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.302
Look how nice that is.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.388
Eighty-pound white gloss text stock.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.056
Super high contrast,
it's really gonna pop.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.307
- Where do I sign?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.976
- Oh. Sure, yeah.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.855
You're a busy man. [chuckles]

09:24.189 --> 09:25.524
Here.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.233
Yep.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.988
Here are the proofs.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.365
- Yep.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.702
Looks good.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.792
Actually.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.962
[pen scratching]

09:48.630 --> 09:49.464
[pen clicks]

09:50.591 --> 09:52.092
Nice round number.

09:52.092 --> 09:52.926
- Uh--

09:53.552 --> 09:54.511
- Is that a problem?

09:55.470 --> 09:58.056
- I mean, uh, no, no, it's--

09:58.056 --> 09:59.391
- Thank you.
- Uh--

10:02.311 --> 10:04.271
[door opens]
Oh shit.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.612
- What are you doing here?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.200
- There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.952
- You know phones work, right?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.372
- I just thought it'd be better in person.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.209
I'm hungry.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.085
You feel like grabbing a bite?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.632
STEVE: So what's the catch?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.091
[chuckles]

10:33.634 --> 10:34.551
- The catch?

10:35.636 --> 10:36.803
There is no catch.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.057
This is what's commonly known
as a win-win.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.810
- So I get half the profit?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.729
- Fifty-fifty, even-stevens.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.397
- And I do not have to put up a dime?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.398
- Or lift a finger.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.195
All you have to do, sit back,
let the checks roll in.

10:53.654 --> 10:58.325
And it instantly expands
the brand, nationally.

10:58.951 --> 10:59.701
Internationally.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.827
[chuckles]

11:03.121 --> 11:04.790
Think of what it'll do for the calendar.

11:04.790 --> 11:08.460
I mean, what's... Swedish for November?

11:11.296 --> 11:12.923
- The whole world?

11:12.923 --> 11:14.299
- Why not?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.884
