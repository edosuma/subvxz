WEBVTT

00:02.041 --> 00:03.401
WOMAN:
<i>Oh, Billy...</i>

00:03.501 --> 00:06.109
Please don't leave me alone.

00:06.209 --> 00:07.692
(<i>screaming</i>)

00:07.792 --> 00:09.150
BILLY:
Guess who.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.067
WOMAN:
Oh!

00:11.167 --> 00:13.025
(<i>gasps happily</i>)

00:13.125 --> 00:13.942
Is it really over?

00:14.042 --> 00:16.900
BILLY:
Yes, Sally May, it is.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.983
SALLY MAY:
Really and truly?

00:19.083 --> 00:19.983
BILLY:
I'm here now,

00:20.083 --> 00:24.899
and as long as I'm with you,
everything is gonna be A-OK.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.359
SALLY:
Promise?

00:26.459 --> 00:27.776
BILLY:
Promise.

00:27.876 --> 00:28.900
You're my hero, Billy.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.859
And I think
you're swell, Sally May.

00:31.959 --> 00:35.125
(<i>romantic music swells</i>)

00:54.459 --> 00:55.359
Cole?

00:55.459 --> 00:57.734
Phoebe. Hi.

00:57.834 --> 00:58.899
Just a little trick

00:58.999 --> 01:02.401
I learned
from the demon of illusion.

01:02.501 --> 01:03.317
But what...

01:03.417 --> 01:04.899
...Am I doing in here?

01:04.998 --> 01:07.109
Uh, I wasn't sure
how you'd react.

01:07.209 --> 01:09.359
I thought
this might be a safer way

01:09.459 --> 01:15.000
of letting you know
I was back... for good.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.609
PRUE:
So, um, I had a really good

02:16.709 --> 02:17.899
time tonight, Justin.

02:17.999 --> 02:18.692
Did you?

02:18.792 --> 02:19.734
I mean, really?

02:19.834 --> 02:22.899
The reason I ask is you
seem kind of quiet.

02:22.999 --> 02:25.899
Uh, no, it's just
that, you know,

02:25.999 --> 02:27.526
I've got a lot
on my mind

02:27.626 --> 02:29.899
with Piper getting
married and everything.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.526
Sure.

02:31.626 --> 02:33.567
Of course, if I was
the paranoid type,

02:33.667 --> 02:36.192
I'd be thinking
it was because of me.

02:36.292 --> 02:37.567
Don't be ridiculous.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.109
So, uh, are we still on
for lunch tomorrow?

02:40.209 --> 02:41.942
Yeah, pick me up
at 1:00?

02:42.042 --> 02:43.734
It's a date.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.334
Okay.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.067
Good night.

02:53.167 --> 02:55.751
G'night.

03:09.999 --> 03:10.370
Hey.

03:10.380 --> 03:14.484
Gee, Prue, it's only 9:00,
and your date's already over?

03:14.584 --> 03:15.900
How very Disney of you.

03:16.000 --> 03:16.692
(<i>forced laugh</i>)

03:16.792 --> 03:18.567
Justin has a meeting
early in the morning.

03:18.667 --> 03:19.983
PIPER:
I see. So, did
you decide

03:20.083 --> 03:22.942
if you're going to invite
him to the wedding?

03:23.042 --> 03:24.859
No. I'm stalling.

03:24.959 --> 03:25.692
I mean,

03:25.792 --> 03:27.734
you know, he's a
nice guy, he's sweet,

03:27.834 --> 03:29.899
but he's just
so predictable.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.526
You know,
there's no mystery,

03:31.626 --> 03:33.442
no savoir faire.

03:33.542 --> 03:36.899
You know, besides,
a wedding invite

03:36.999 --> 03:38.484
definitely makes
a statement.

03:38.584 --> 03:40.692
That he can tie a bowtie?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.899
No, that the
relationship is serious.

03:42.999 --> 03:44.651
You know, that it's
going somewhere.

03:44.751 --> 03:45.899
All that
built-in romance,

03:45.999 --> 03:47.899
mingling with the family,
hidden tensions...

03:47.999 --> 03:52.125
Hmm, all the more reason to have
a nice, simple, private wedding.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.859
Nice, try mister.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.651
Okay, wedding
planner--

03:56.751 --> 03:57.651
tomorrow at 11:00.

03:57.751 --> 04:00.401
No getting out of it,
no orbing out of it,

04:00.501 --> 04:01.401
nothing.

04:01.501 --> 04:03.375
Don't even try it.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.109
I don't know.

04:29.209 --> 04:29.899
I just don't want her

04:29.999 --> 04:31.442
to set herself up
for a big disappointment.

04:31.542 --> 04:32.734
I mean, how do you have
a normal wedding

04:32.834 --> 04:34.359
when a ghost will be presiding
and the groom's dead?

04:34.459 --> 04:37.442
Leo, don't even try
and figure it out, all right?

04:37.542 --> 04:38.899
It's the Cinderella complex.

04:38.999 --> 04:39.900
Every girl
goes through it.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.567
I've been dreaming of this day
my entire life.

04:43.667 --> 04:44.899
Piper's wedding?

04:44.999 --> 04:46.109
No, mine.

04:46.209 --> 04:48.192
I mean, I'm the oldest.
I'm supposed to do

04:48.292 --> 04:49.025
everything first.

04:49.125 --> 04:49.899
I'm supposed to talk first

04:49.999 --> 04:54.067
and get braces and get
a boyfriend and find a husband.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.025
PIPER:
Hey, Prue?

04:56.125 --> 04:58.067
Can I borrow
your lipstick?

04:58.167 --> 04:58.859
What?

04:58.959 --> 04:59.859
Lipstick.

04:59.959 --> 05:00.899
I'm out. Do you mind?

05:00.999 --> 05:04.542
Sure, knock yourself out.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You're welcome.

05:22.667 --> 05:23.662
Listen, speaking
of Phoebe, don't you

05:23.672 --> 05:24.899
think it's time you
let her off the hook

05:24.999 --> 05:26.899
a little? I mean,
she came clean about Cole.

05:26.999 --> 05:29.818
Leo, you can't just
pretend to vanquish a demon

05:29.918 --> 05:30.899
and then two months later say,

05:30.999 --> 05:33.317
"Gee, guys,
I'm sorry, I didn't."

05:33.417 --> 05:34.245
I know, but for what it's worth,

05:34.255 --> 05:36.567
I don't think she wants him back
in her life any more.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.275
Maybe not, but that doesn't mean

05:38.375 --> 05:40.999
he's not gonna try
and kill us again.

05:42.250 --> 05:45.999
(<i>squeaking</i>)

06:05.459 --> 06:06.876
Dantalian.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.667
Priestess Dantalian.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.125
Were you successful?

06:19.918 --> 06:22.275
She's as beautiful
as you said she'd be.

06:22.375 --> 06:26.401
You're certain
this has touched her lips?

06:26.501 --> 06:27.484
Absolutely.

06:27.584 --> 06:29.459
I watched her all night.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.983
Not to be ungrateful,

06:33.083 --> 06:35.776
but what do you get

06:35.876 --> 06:38.734
out of making Prue
Halliwell my wife?

06:38.834 --> 06:41.899
I'm a humble servant
of the Source, Zile.

06:41.999 --> 06:43.209
I get nothing...

06:43.999 --> 06:45.899
...other than
the benefits we all reap

06:45.999 --> 06:47.359
whenever good is turned to evil.

06:47.459 --> 06:49.484
Still, for all the unions
you've consecrated,

06:49.584 --> 06:51.651
it seems you should
get something.

06:51.751 --> 06:52.899
Especially
for this one.

06:52.999 --> 06:57.792
There is a spoil...

07:00.167 --> 07:01.776
...that intrigues me.

07:01.876 --> 07:03.317
The Halliwell <i>Book of Shadows</i>

07:03.417 --> 07:07.484
is said to be
the most magical of all tomes.

07:07.584 --> 07:08.899
The witches'<i>Book of Shadows?</i>

07:08.999 --> 07:11.025
That shouldn't be
too hard to get.

07:11.125 --> 07:14.692
This one is.

07:14.792 --> 07:15.900
Evil can't touch it.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.275
Although turning Prue evil

07:18.375 --> 07:20.609
should turn her sisters
and their Book

07:20.709 --> 07:22.818
evil, as well.

07:22.918 --> 07:24.609
Their magic's interconnected.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.651
Well, then I'll get
it for you myself.

07:26.751 --> 07:29.234
As a token
of my gratitude.

07:29.334 --> 07:32.025
First things first.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.526
Getting the witch here

07:34.626 --> 07:37.317
so I can perform
the ceremony,

07:37.417 --> 07:39.983
that's what this potion is for.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.651
Kiss her

07:41.751 --> 07:43.484
and it paralyzes her.

07:43.584 --> 07:45.899
After I bind you
in marriage,

07:45.999 --> 07:47.150
she'll fall into a deep sleep

07:47.250 --> 07:50.501
where the transformation
to evil will occur.

08:04.042 --> 08:05.442
PIPER:
<i>Okay, so the more</i>

08:05.542 --> 08:06.900
traditional the better,

08:07.000 --> 08:07.899
as far
as I'm concerned.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.899
The wedding march
starts and I come

08:09.999 --> 08:10.899
down the stairs...

08:10.999 --> 08:11.983
So no flower girl?

08:12.083 --> 08:14.900
Uh... I don't know.
Do I?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.567
Well, unless you want to ask
Kate down the street.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.234
LEO:
Great idea.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.317
Maybe she can bring some
of her fairy friends.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.692
Or trolls, even better.

08:22.792 --> 08:23.899
Trolls?

08:23.999 --> 08:24.983
PRUE:
Uh, right.

08:25.083 --> 08:25.942
Trolls, uh...

08:26.042 --> 08:27.859
our father's side
of the family

08:27.959 --> 08:28.983
is very short.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.899
Right, let's skip
the flower girl.

08:30.999 --> 08:31.651
(<i>quietly</i>):
Right.

08:31.751 --> 08:32.899
WOMAN:
Well, I think we
should at least

08:32.999 --> 08:34.317
dress the banister
with garlands.

08:34.417 --> 08:34.994
Maybe even carry

08:35.004 --> 08:38.025
the floral theme all
the way to the altar.

08:38.125 --> 08:38.609
Oh...!

08:38.708 --> 08:40.818
How many guests are
you planning on?

08:40.918 --> 08:43.234
Uh... let me think.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.776
50? 60?

08:44.876 --> 08:46.899
60? Like who?

08:46.999 --> 08:47.899
Well, there's all

08:47.999 --> 08:49.776
the people
from P3,

08:49.876 --> 08:52.692
friends and Darryl and Dad, Mom.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.983
Uh... Mom?

08:55.083 --> 08:55.609
Piper, I don't

08:55.709 --> 08:57.818
really think
that you can count her.

08:57.918 --> 08:58.692
MAN:
We'll have to

08:58.792 --> 08:59.609
if she's going to eat.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.692
Oh, trust me, she
won't be eating.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.526
I thought your mother passed on.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.899
Mm-hmm.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.150
Right, she did. Um...

09:06.250 --> 09:07.899
I just meant
I hope

09:07.999 --> 09:09.818
she's there in spirit.

09:09.918 --> 09:10.120
Oh.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.567
You're right,
that doesn't count.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.484
Now, have you thought
about what hors d'oeuvres

09:14.584 --> 09:16.025
you'd like, by any chance?

09:16.125 --> 09:16.899
Um...

09:16.999 --> 09:18.150
Pigs in a blanket?

09:18.250 --> 09:21.899
(<i>laughing</i>)

09:21.999 --> 09:23.442
Leo, I was, I was hoping

09:23.542 --> 09:25.609
for something
a bit more elegant.

09:25.709 --> 09:26.899
(<i>phone ringing</i>)

09:26.999 --> 09:27.942
I'll get that.

09:28.042 --> 09:29.899
Excuse us.

09:29.999 --> 09:32.109
We still need to place
the ice sculpture.

09:32.209 --> 09:32.776
Hello?

09:32.876 --> 09:34.859
What is the matter
with you?

09:34.959 --> 09:35.609
Why are you doing this?

09:35.709 --> 09:38.942
Because this is a disaster
waiting to happen, that's why.

09:39.042 --> 09:42.442
Ah, well,
keep that up and it will be.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.275
Piper, I love you,

09:44.375 --> 09:45.942
and I want nothing
more for you

09:46.042 --> 09:47.734
than to have your
dream wedding,

09:47.834 --> 09:49.317
but you are kidding
yourself with this.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.776
We don't need wedding planners,
we just need us.

09:51.876 --> 09:54.526
You may not need wedding
planners, but I do.

09:54.626 --> 09:56.899
I don't want to have
to worry about anything,

09:56.999 --> 09:58.192
and therefore,
if I have to fight

09:58.292 --> 09:58.995
a demon in
the morning,

09:59.005 --> 10:01.859
I know that the flowers
will still be there on time.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.067
It's not the flowers
I'm worried about,

10:03.167 --> 10:06.234
it's the guests, as in how do
we explain everything to them?

10:06.334 --> 10:08.859
I mean a whitelighter
marrying a witch

10:08.959 --> 10:10.150
is hardly
traditional.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.417
Obviously.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.192
Okay, Justin, uh, I'll
meet you there. Bye.

10:18.292 --> 10:19.401
Hey, Phoebe.

10:19.501 --> 10:20.526
I'm running late for school.

10:20.626 --> 10:21.245
Okay. Do you want a ride?

10:21.255 --> 10:22.651
Isn't Justin picking you up
for lunch?

10:22.751 --> 10:24.942
Well, his car broke down,
so I'm meeting him there.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.359
And I thought that, uh,
we could talk, you know?

10:27.459 --> 10:30.025
Try and put this whole
Cole situation behind us.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.999
I gotta go.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.859
Okay, tell me
the truth.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.192
Do you think
I'm overdoing it

10:37.292 --> 10:39.651
with the wedding stuff?

10:39.751 --> 10:40.899
Hello?

10:40.999 --> 10:42.692
Uh, okay, why is Phoebe

10:42.792 --> 10:44.359
going to school
without her books?

10:44.459 --> 10:48.192
Okay, why is Prue
not answering Piper's question?

10:48.292 --> 10:49.317
Maybe because she doesn't want

10:49.417 --> 10:51.899
both of her sisters
not speaking to her.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.234
Um, okay, I have
to go meet Justin.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.899
Can I have my lipstick back?

10:55.999 --> 10:56.412
What lipstick?

10:56.422 --> 10:59.442
The one that you borrowed
last night at the club.

10:59.542 --> 11:00.818
Wasn't me.

11:00.918 --> 11:05.192
Right. I must have gotten you
confused with another Piper.

11:05.292 --> 11:06.359
Uh. Huh.

11:06.459 --> 11:07.651
Okay, you have fun

11:07.751 --> 11:09.275
with what's
going on here,

11:09.375 --> 11:10.526
'cause it looks great.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.250
Okay, bye.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
Cole?

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
Phoebe?

11:47.999 --> 11:50.709
I knew you'd know
where to find me.

11:53.501 --> 11:56.275
That is for ruining
my favorite movie.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.234
And, oh, yeah,
my life, too.

11:58.334 --> 12:00.275
Phoebe...
I don't want
to hear it, Cole.

12:00.375 --> 12:01.776
I'm over you.

12:01.876 --> 12:04.150
I want nothing
to do with you any more.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.818
I don't believe that.

12:05.918 --> 12:06.287
Oh, yeah?

12:06.297 --> 12:08.692
Well, believe it, because
if I ever see you again,

12:08.792 --> 12:09.983
I'm gonna do what
I should have done

12:10.083 --> 12:12.359
a long time ago, which is
vanquish your sorry ass.

12:12.459 --> 12:14.567
Apparently distance
hasn't exactly

12:14.667 --> 12:16.692
made the heart
grow fonder.

12:16.792 --> 12:18.859
Huh.

12:18.959 --> 12:19.899
Phoebe, wait.

12:19.999 --> 12:20.818
Hey!

12:20.918 --> 12:21.621
Look, I took a huge risk

12:21.631 --> 12:23.025
coming out in the open
and contacting you.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.125
Least you can do is hear me out.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.567
I've been
hiding this whole time,

12:32.667 --> 12:34.442
shimmering from realm
to realm to realm

12:34.542 --> 12:35.899
to keep the Source
from realizing

12:35.999 --> 12:38.417
you didn't
vanquish my sorry ass.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.818
You're the only one
who knows I'm alive.

12:40.918 --> 12:42.899
Actually, that's not true.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.526
I couldn't keep

12:43.626 --> 12:46.317
lying to my sisters,
I had to tell them.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.899
Okay.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.317
That's okay.

12:49.417 --> 12:50.484
I understand.

12:50.584 --> 12:52.959
As long as you didn't tell Leo.

12:53.792 --> 12:54.484
Oh, for God's sake, Phoebe.

12:54.584 --> 12:56.442
Why don't you just
put an ad in the paper,

12:56.542 --> 12:57.329
tell the whole damn world?

12:57.339 --> 12:59.999
You know what,
maybe I should have.

13:04.959 --> 13:08.918
I've risked my life
for you, Phoebe-- my soul.

13:09.918 --> 13:12.442
I've put myself in more danger
coming back here

13:12.542 --> 13:13.899
than you could possibly imagine.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.859
Because I want to try
and figure out a way

13:15.959 --> 13:17.359
to make this work between us.

13:17.459 --> 13:20.109
Good and evil
can't work together.

13:20.209 --> 13:21.109
We did before.

13:21.209 --> 13:22.983
I learned from my mistake.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.501
So did I.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.734
Phoebe, I can suppress
my demonic half

13:26.834 --> 13:30.751
just like I suppressed my human
half before we met.

13:31.709 --> 13:32.899
I can be good.

13:32.999 --> 13:33.776
You've seen that.

13:33.876 --> 13:37.999
And if you know I can,
then why can't we be together?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.999
It's too late.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.234
(<i>classical music
 playing softly</i>)

13:59.334 --> 14:03.999
(<i>low, indistinct
conversation</i>)

14:07.125 --> 14:08.442
Hey.

14:08.542 --> 14:09.067
Hey.

14:09.167 --> 14:09.900
Sorry about my car.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.899
Thanks for meeting me here.

14:10.999 --> 14:15.067
Oh, that's okay.
It's not a, uh... problem.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.317
What?

14:16.417 --> 14:18.734
Nothing.

14:18.834 --> 14:21.275
You know, I really should sell
that old thing,

14:21.375 --> 14:24.899
but I don't know--
I kind of like having something

14:24.999 --> 14:25.899
not so predictable

14:25.999 --> 14:27.859
in this day and age.

14:27.959 --> 14:29.818
Know what I mean?

14:29.918 --> 14:30.287
Right.

14:30.297 --> 14:34.526
So, you don't think of yourself
as predictable?

14:34.626 --> 14:35.818
Me?

14:35.918 --> 14:36.899
Pardon me.

14:36.999 --> 14:37.734
Beringer

14:37.834 --> 14:38.859
private reserve.

14:38.959 --> 14:40.709
Yes, thank you.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.192
Predictable?

14:43.292 --> 14:44.899
Hardly.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.526
Right.

14:46.626 --> 14:48.999
(<i>clears throat</i>)

14:50.417 --> 14:51.651
Hey, Justin.

14:51.751 --> 14:52.234
Hey.

14:52.334 --> 14:53.526
What are you doing here?

14:53.626 --> 14:55.999
I'm picking up Prue for lunch.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.109
PHOEBE:
Piper?

15:00.209 --> 15:02.150
Is something wrong?

15:02.250 --> 15:03.234
I'm not sure.

15:03.334 --> 15:05.899
What's up?
Where's Prue?

15:05.999 --> 15:06.609
I don't know.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.234
At the restaurant,
I guess.

15:08.334 --> 15:09.899
Supposedly meeting Justin.

15:09.999 --> 15:11.859
No, I told her
I'd pick her up here.

15:11.959 --> 15:12.913
Okay, so you didn't call
this morning

15:12.923 --> 15:16.317
and tell her that your car broke
down and you'd meet her there?

15:16.417 --> 15:18.167
No.

15:20.334 --> 15:21.359
(<i>chuckling</i>)

15:21.459 --> 15:21.983
Oh, no, no,

15:22.083 --> 15:23.983
I have to work this afternoon.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.899
Well, so your photograph's
a little fuzzy.

15:26.999 --> 15:27.776
Call it avant-garde.

15:27.876 --> 15:29.375
(<i>phone ringing</i>)
Oh.

15:29.999 --> 15:31.999
How important can it be?

15:36.125 --> 15:37.150
What?

15:37.250 --> 15:40.401
Can I ask you a favor?

15:40.501 --> 15:41.776
Sure.

15:41.876 --> 15:44.900
Last night when we kissed
good-bye it was...

15:45.000 --> 15:47.067
I don't know... not great.

15:47.167 --> 15:48.776
Yeah.

15:48.876 --> 15:49.899
How about we try it again?

15:49.999 --> 15:52.918
See if we can't do it
a little better?

15:54.501 --> 15:54.899
Come on.

15:54.999 --> 15:58.375
What's the worst
that could happen?

16:23.876 --> 16:26.999
Where am I?

16:29.209 --> 16:30.942
I can't move.

16:31.042 --> 16:33.000
My apologies.

16:44.501 --> 16:46.776
It's true--

16:46.876 --> 16:50.334
Every bride is beautiful
on her wedding day.

17:07.334 --> 17:08.608
Find her?

17:08.709 --> 17:09.651
Not yet.

17:09.751 --> 17:11.150
We're screwed.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.999
Not yet.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.898
Leo, what did you find out?

17:16.999 --> 17:18.067
Nothing.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.898
Okay, now we're screwed.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.692
PIPER:
Nothing on the map,

17:21.791 --> 17:22.442
nothing in the Book.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.858
Leo, somebody must
know something.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.317
Well, the Elders support your
shape-shifting warlock theory,

17:26.416 --> 17:28.567
but they can't get a clear
read on the situation.

17:28.667 --> 17:31.484
Wait, so Prue's vanished
from your radar

17:31.584 --> 17:33.899
and something's jamming theirs?

17:33.999 --> 17:35.234
Something like that.

17:35.334 --> 17:35.994
But she can't
be dead;

17:36.004 --> 17:38.818
they'd be able to sense that no
matter how evil is interfering.

17:38.918 --> 17:41.942
Okay, then what's going on?
What are we up against?

17:42.042 --> 17:43.734
PIPER:
Something
powerful enough

17:43.834 --> 17:45.442
to keep us from finding her.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.609
LEO:
Well, you knew as

17:46.709 --> 17:47.818
your powers grew,
evil's would, too.

17:47.918 --> 17:50.067
Yeah, so powerful that we can't
figure out who they are,

17:50.167 --> 17:51.899
let alone how to fight them--
that sucks!

17:51.999 --> 17:53.359
All right, what we
need to figure out

17:53.459 --> 17:55.359
is why a warlock
wants Prue alive.

17:55.459 --> 17:57.899
Well, it can't just be
for her powers.

17:57.999 --> 17:58.818
I mean they wouldn't

17:58.918 --> 18:00.899
need to keep her alive
to get them.

18:00.999 --> 18:03.651
Unless it's an upper level
warlock which wants...

18:03.751 --> 18:04.942
...All of our powers.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.899
PIPER:
But we still have
the same problem--

18:06.999 --> 18:08.818
no idea how to find her.

18:08.918 --> 18:13.250
It's too bad you vanquished
that demonic bounty hunter.

18:13.999 --> 18:15.359
Could've helped.

18:15.459 --> 18:19.042
Right.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.899
Where are you going?

18:22.999 --> 18:25.150
I have a hunch.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.292
Wait for me.

18:35.292 --> 18:38.317
Shall we begin?

18:38.417 --> 18:40.275
I'm ready.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.501
I hope so.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.818
In the beginning,
we were damned,

18:47.918 --> 18:50.818
and through damnation
we found freedom,

18:50.918 --> 18:52.899
power, and purpose.

18:52.999 --> 19:00.734
As I unite you today,
I remind you of those gifts.

19:00.834 --> 19:02.899
And, in your union,

19:02.999 --> 19:08.275
may these gifts increase,
so your powers may grow

19:08.375 --> 19:10.609
in the service of

19:10.709 --> 19:12.818
evil.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.125
So be it.

19:15.834 --> 19:20.109
How long before her
transformation is complete?

19:20.209 --> 19:21.317
Sundown.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.692
Can you wait that long?

19:22.792 --> 19:24.899
ZILE:
For the power
of the Charmed Ones?

19:24.999 --> 19:28.125
I can wait a few hours.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.959
Let me be the first
to congratulate you.

19:43.667 --> 19:46.899
(<i>laughs quietly</i>)

19:46.999 --> 19:47.818
(<i>groggily</i>):
Why?

19:47.918 --> 19:51.899
Because I'm tired of bestowing
great power on others.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.818
The Halliwell
<i>Book of Shadows</i>

19:53.918 --> 19:59.150
is the key to unbelievable
power... for me.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.192
Evil will spread

20:00.292 --> 20:02.776
from this sister
to the other two

20:02.876 --> 20:03.983
and from them to the Book

20:04.083 --> 20:07.234
and once the Book is evil,
it'll be mine.

20:07.334 --> 20:09.067
And I will be

20:09.167 --> 20:10.667
unstoppable.

20:12.751 --> 20:14.942
But know this--

20:15.042 --> 20:21.459
I will enjoy killing all of you.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.899
Cole? Cole?!

20:29.999 --> 20:32.234
Please, if you can
hear me, I...

20:32.334 --> 20:33.150
I was beginning

20:33.250 --> 20:35.192
to think
I'd never see you again.

20:35.292 --> 20:36.526
I'm not here because of us.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.275
I need you to help me,
and if you do,

20:38.375 --> 20:39.899
it doesn't change anything
between us.

20:39.999 --> 20:41.192
You have to know that.

20:41.292 --> 20:44.375
Hmm.

20:45.584 --> 20:46.692
I'm listening.

20:46.792 --> 20:47.899
Prue was taken

20:47.999 --> 20:49.067
by a warlock.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.651
Do you know which one?

20:50.751 --> 20:52.526
We think he's
a shape-shifter,

20:52.626 --> 20:54.734
but the weird thing is
is nobody from our side

20:54.834 --> 20:56.859
can get a read
on where he's hiding her.

20:56.959 --> 20:57.899
Well, that doesn't make sense.

20:57.999 --> 20:59.401
Warlocks don't have
that kind of power.

20:59.501 --> 21:01.776
He must be working with
somebody that does.

21:01.876 --> 21:03.692
Certain dignitaries have

21:03.792 --> 21:07.899
the power to shield
their activities:
demonic judges,

21:07.999 --> 21:12.359
dark priests, anyone who
needs privacy for rituals.

21:12.459 --> 21:13.899
What kind of rituals?

21:13.999 --> 21:15.067
To accomplish what?

21:15.167 --> 21:15.983
It's hard to say.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.025
It could be anything.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.567
They may want your Book.

21:18.667 --> 21:19.900
We all want your Book.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.818
Really?

21:21.918 --> 21:23.459
I wanted the Book...

21:24.292 --> 21:25.192
...at first.

21:25.292 --> 21:28.275
Well, how can we find out
who wants it now?

21:28.375 --> 21:29.317
I could check around

21:29.417 --> 21:34.042
but I'd risk demons finding out
I was still alive.

21:34.501 --> 21:38.109
I'm sure there's still a huge
bounty on my head.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.609
I want my sister back.

21:40.709 --> 21:43.109
No matter the cost?

21:43.209 --> 21:47.209
I want my sister back.

21:53.876 --> 21:57.899
I'm doing this for you--

21:57.999 --> 21:59.999
know that.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.692
Now I'm really confused.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.899
Me, too. I, uh...

22:14.999 --> 22:19.375
I don't... I don't know
where that came from.

22:21.834 --> 22:22.899
Okay.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
Uh, I better go.

22:25.417 --> 22:29.401
Listen, if you don't hear back
from me,

22:29.501 --> 22:30.651
I, um...

22:30.751 --> 22:32.999
I got caught.

22:42.042 --> 22:44.483
(<i>footsteps approaching</i>)

22:44.583 --> 22:47.942
I thought you said there
was nothing in the Book.

22:48.042 --> 22:53.067
Well, now there's
just a whole bunch
of weirdness in it.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.192
Look.

22:54.292 --> 22:55.483
Hemlock killing spell?

22:55.583 --> 22:56.859
That doesn't belong in here.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.318
But it does have possibilities.

22:59.418 --> 23:00.318
Piper...

23:00.418 --> 23:02.692
I'm sorry. I-I don't know

23:02.792 --> 23:04.126
what I was...

23:06.500 --> 23:09.399
LEO:
Piper?

23:09.499 --> 23:12.625
In here. Somehow.

23:15.334 --> 23:16.399
You blinked.

23:16.499 --> 23:19.901
I did not!
Only warlocks do that.

23:20.001 --> 23:20.775
Piper, you did it.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.318
Hey.
Where have you been?

23:23.418 --> 23:25.609
Uh... brainstorming.

23:25.709 --> 23:27.151
How's it going here?

23:27.251 --> 23:29.192
Your sister's blinking.

23:29.292 --> 23:32.650
I-I'm... I'm sorry, what?

23:32.750 --> 23:34.026
Okay, I admit,

23:34.126 --> 23:35.399
it was definitely weird,

23:35.499 --> 23:36.650
but it was kind of fun.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.399
I was... I was in there,

23:37.499 --> 23:40.399
and I was thinking
about the kitchen,
and then suddenly,

23:40.499 --> 23:41.525
boom, here I was.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.151
That is so cool.

23:43.251 --> 23:45.650
Except that it's
a warlock's power.
PHOEBE:
So what?

23:45.750 --> 23:47.151
They're always trying to get
one of ours.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.734
It's about time
we get one of theirs.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.399
Try it, Pheebs.

23:50.499 --> 23:51.567
PHOEBE:
Okay, what do I do?

23:51.667 --> 23:54.709
Just think?
And blink.

24:00.376 --> 24:02.499
Catch us if you can!

24:08.209 --> 24:11.399
Have you tried it yet, Leo?
It's a real head rush.

24:11.499 --> 24:13.359
Do you realize
how serious this is?

24:13.459 --> 24:14.442
You're blinking.

24:14.542 --> 24:15.276
The Book is changing.

24:15.376 --> 24:17.483
Maybe we're blinking
<i>because</i> of the Book.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.650
The Book is changing
because of you.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.650
It is an extension of you.

24:20.750 --> 24:24.359
Huh. I should care
about that...

24:24.459 --> 24:26.625
but I don't.

24:28.625 --> 24:29.442
This is what
I was afraid of.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.775
Whoever's got Prue is
somehow reaching you, too.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.859
Okay, Leo, I can tell
this really upsets you,

24:33.959 --> 24:36.026
but I got to tell you,
I really like this whole

24:36.126 --> 24:38.399
"think it and it happens" deal--
I mean, just think

24:38.499 --> 24:40.775
of the time we could save
not chanting.
Mm-hmm.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.859
Piper, Phoebe,
you have to fight this.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.567
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)
Oh!

24:44.667 --> 24:48.109
Or we could
answer the door.

24:48.209 --> 24:49.067
For Prue's sake, stop!

24:49.167 --> 24:53.109
Don't tell me what to do.

24:53.209 --> 24:54.442
Ooh...

24:54.542 --> 24:56.567
Phoebe, I need your help.

24:56.667 --> 25:00.067
I am so tired of helping people.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.151
So glad you're home--
we have some new floral sketches

25:02.251 --> 25:06.399
we'd like you to see.
LEO:
Now's not really a good time.

25:06.499 --> 25:08.026
They're welcome to come in, Leo.

25:08.126 --> 25:10.151
I've revisited the dinner menu,
Piper,

25:10.251 --> 25:11.859
and you are going
to be thrilled.

25:11.959 --> 25:15.292
I have some dynamic
choices that I...

25:15.499 --> 25:18.500
I want pigs in blankets.

25:21.959 --> 25:24.525
(<i>laughing</i>)

25:24.625 --> 25:27.026
WOMAN:
It's nice
to see a bride

25:27.126 --> 25:28.442
who still has a sense of humor

25:28.542 --> 25:30.192
this close
to the big day.

25:30.292 --> 25:31.399
No.

25:31.499 --> 25:35.459
I want pigs in blankets!

25:37.499 --> 25:39.734
(<i>woman screams, gasps</i>)

25:39.834 --> 25:42.399
(<i>Phoebe laughing</i>)

25:42.499 --> 25:44.792
(<i>grunting, squeaking</i>)

25:45.376 --> 25:46.775
Marie seems very scared.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.525
PIPER:
I always had her pegged
as an ice queen.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.917
Oh! What a great idea.

25:52.499 --> 25:53.667
(<i>gasps</i>)

25:56.499 --> 25:59.318
Now,<i>there</i> is a freezing
power with kick!

25:59.418 --> 26:00.984
Have you guys lost
your minds?

26:01.084 --> 26:02.399
PHOEBE:
Oh, Leo,
get on board.

26:02.499 --> 26:05.318
Whatever it is,
this is fabulous.

26:05.418 --> 26:06.650
You can't imagine
the freedom,

26:06.750 --> 26:08.525
the power.
Phoebe, that is
evil talking.

26:08.625 --> 26:09.442
You have to fight it.

26:09.542 --> 26:10.901
What did you ever see in him?

26:11.001 --> 26:14.734
I don't know-- he is kind of
a stick in the mud, isn't he?

26:14.834 --> 26:15.567
Oh,

26:15.667 --> 26:17.500
another great idea.

26:18.167 --> 26:19.499
May I?

26:19.917 --> 26:21.334
Be my guest.

26:21.792 --> 26:22.942
All right, think about

26:23.042 --> 26:24.959
the power of evi...

26:26.209 --> 26:27.399
Oh.

26:27.499 --> 26:28.151
Mm.

26:28.251 --> 26:31.650
Oh... Look at all the fun
we've been missing.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.499
And this is just the beginning.

26:35.418 --> 26:38.399
See you, Leo.

26:38.499 --> 26:40.667
(<i>oinking</i>)

26:48.499 --> 26:52.667
(<i>creatures screeching
 in distance</i>)

26:57.834 --> 27:02.376
Just the beginning.

27:09.499 --> 27:13.318
(<i>grunting quietly</i>)

27:13.418 --> 27:13.942
Uh!

27:14.042 --> 27:16.026
Oh, you know,
it's your wedding.

27:16.126 --> 27:17.817
Shouldn't the
first kill be yours?

27:17.917 --> 27:19.109
(<i>pig squeals, grunts</i>)

27:19.209 --> 27:20.901
This is too easy.
It's boring.

27:21.001 --> 27:22.399
I want to do something

27:22.499 --> 27:24.399
bigger.
Count me in.

27:24.499 --> 27:28.442
You know, if what's happening
to us is happening to Prue...

27:28.542 --> 27:32.026
...Then the power of three
can be truly amazing.

27:32.126 --> 27:34.167
We have to find her.

27:34.499 --> 27:38.376
But first we need
to clean house.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.499
(<i>exhales</i>)

27:44.917 --> 27:47.859
I'm sorry, uh... (<i>snorts</i>),
what were you saying?

27:47.959 --> 27:50.126
You're fired!

27:52.334 --> 27:54.750
(<i>both yell, grunt</i>)

27:56.583 --> 27:57.609
(<i>laughs</i>)

27:57.709 --> 27:58.817
(<i>sighs</i>)

27:58.917 --> 28:00.026
Oh, no!

28:00.126 --> 28:02.692
What are we gonna do
with the stick in the mud?

28:02.792 --> 28:06.459
Wait! I think we can
have some fun with it.

28:10.499 --> 28:12.817
What happened
to Craig and Marie?

28:12.917 --> 28:14.734
Oh, they flew right out of here.

28:14.834 --> 28:16.442
Scared the hell out of 'em.

28:16.542 --> 28:18.399
Leo, we need to find Prue.

28:18.499 --> 28:21.442
Good, Phoebe, focus on that--
it'll help you resist the evil.

28:21.542 --> 28:22.859
Uh, the only thing
we're resisting is

28:22.959 --> 28:25.775
the desire to rip you to pieces
and have you for lunch.

28:25.875 --> 28:27.276
PIPER:
But if you help us

28:27.376 --> 28:29.151
find Prue,
we'll leave you alone...

28:29.251 --> 28:31.399
for the moment.
(<i>ethereal whoosh</i>)

28:31.499 --> 28:32.525
Oh...

28:32.625 --> 28:33.734
Oh, Leo, ignore them.

28:33.834 --> 28:34.442
What do they know?

28:34.542 --> 28:36.650
They're backing a losing team.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.734
They're revoking my assignment.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.984
What? They can't do that.

28:41.084 --> 28:42.984
You haven't done
anything wrong...

28:43.084 --> 28:44.234
yet.

28:44.334 --> 28:45.192
You did.

28:45.292 --> 28:46.399
You gave in to evil.

28:46.499 --> 28:48.026
You've relinquished
your right

28:48.126 --> 28:50.418
to a whitelighter.

28:52.667 --> 28:55.750
I'm sorry.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.609
Well...

28:57.709 --> 29:01.399
Oh, no. He's gone.

29:01.499 --> 29:03.026
We're free!

29:03.126 --> 29:03.984
Yes.

29:04.084 --> 29:05.399
No more obeying the rules,

29:05.499 --> 29:08.399
considering the consequences,
none of that crap!

29:08.499 --> 29:09.400
Time to find Prue

29:09.500 --> 29:11.109
and go for broke.
Where are you going?

29:11.209 --> 29:15.067
Well, I can't wreak havoc
dressed like this.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.499
Oh.

29:23.042 --> 29:24.234
(<i>gasps</i>)

29:24.334 --> 29:26.399
Phoebe.
Cole.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.399
You're okay.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.984
(<i>sighs</i>):
Yeah...

29:29.084 --> 29:29.859
barely.

29:29.959 --> 29:31.399
Any demons spot you?

29:31.499 --> 29:32.817
Just one.

29:32.917 --> 29:33.399
Oh, no.

29:33.499 --> 29:36.359
No worries-- he won't be
telling anybody anything.

29:36.459 --> 29:40.399
The big bad Belthazor
strikes again.

29:40.499 --> 29:43.109
Not anything I'm proud of.

29:43.209 --> 29:46.499
Why not? You should be.

29:52.334 --> 29:55.192
(<i>clears throat</i>):
Phoebe, if what
I found out is true,

29:55.292 --> 29:56.276
Prue's in serious trouble.

29:56.376 --> 29:57.901
She's been forced
to marry a warlock.

29:58.001 --> 30:01.109
Figures that bitch would
steal Piper's thunder.

30:01.209 --> 30:03.901
(<i>chuckles</i>):
You don't understand.

30:04.001 --> 30:05.109
A high-level priestess

30:05.209 --> 30:07.442
named Dantalian
is rumored to have
married them,

30:07.542 --> 30:10.026
and she's got the power
to turn Prue evil

30:10.126 --> 30:12.400
and... turn you evil, too.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.567
That's what's...

30:13.667 --> 30:15.692
happening here.

30:15.792 --> 30:16.901
So?

30:17.001 --> 30:19.875
Isn't that the way
you want me?

30:24.499 --> 30:25.109
No...

30:25.209 --> 30:26.734
That is not how
I want you to be.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.442
It's not how
I want <i>us</i> to be.

30:28.542 --> 30:33.234
Our only chance is if
we're both... good.

30:33.334 --> 30:34.609
Love is love.

30:34.709 --> 30:39.650
There's no such thing
as evil love, it's just
gratification, lust.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.901
You know what, Cole?

30:41.001 --> 30:43.901
Your human half
is kind of preachy.

30:44.001 --> 30:46.609
I think I want Belthazor back.

30:46.709 --> 30:48.734
He's not coming back.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.917
Oh, no?

30:54.001 --> 30:57.959
I... want... Belthazor!

31:00.418 --> 31:02.499
(<i>growls</i>)

31:03.499 --> 31:06.067
(<i>exhales</i>):
That's more like it.

31:06.167 --> 31:07.984
(<i>knocking</i>)
PIPER:
Phoebe?

31:08.084 --> 31:09.109
What are you doing?

31:09.209 --> 31:12.192
Dantalian's coming
for your Book.

31:12.292 --> 31:14.917
You better be ready.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.359
What's going on in here?

31:18.459 --> 31:20.942
Nothing, unfortunately.

31:21.042 --> 31:22.525
I heard voices.

31:22.625 --> 31:23.650
Oh, did you?

31:23.750 --> 31:26.318
Um, I had a premonition.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.442
Must've gotten pretty loud.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.109
I guess.

31:30.209 --> 31:31.399
We got to go.

31:31.499 --> 31:33.399
The high priestess
that has Prue,

31:33.499 --> 31:35.775
supposedly she's coming here.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.001
High prie...

31:38.875 --> 31:41.483
Must have been
a hell of a premonition.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.650

32:01.667 --> 32:04.625
It's time.

32:24.418 --> 32:26.151
That was easy.

32:26.251 --> 32:28.399
Too easy.

(<i>grunts</i>)

32:29.667 --> 32:32.334
(<i>gasps</i>)

32:38.792 --> 32:41.334
Where's our sister?

32:41.917 --> 32:43.859
I can help you.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.650
I can teach you evil.

32:45.750 --> 32:46.399
You're new at it.

32:46.499 --> 32:48.567
You don't know how
to realize it's
full potential.

32:48.667 --> 32:52.192
I don't know, I think
we're getting the hang of it.

32:52.292 --> 32:53.817
Want to see?

32:53.917 --> 32:55.109
Where's Prue?

32:55.209 --> 32:59.817
Kill me,
and you'll never see her again.

32:59.917 --> 33:00.942
PIPER:
Hm.

33:01.042 --> 33:02.609
So maybe we should just...

33:02.709 --> 33:05.292
torture you instead!

33:06.334 --> 33:08.542
(<i>Dantalian screaming</i>)

33:09.001 --> 33:12.917
Why don't you just shatter
her hand and see what happens.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.959
(<i>Dantalian panting</i>)

33:19.959 --> 33:21.499
Last chance.

33:22.499 --> 33:23.399
Fine.

33:25.459 --> 33:26.399
Ow.

33:26.499 --> 33:29.026
(<i>Dantalian gasping</i>)

33:29.126 --> 33:29.775
Now...

33:29.875 --> 33:30.817
the really weird thing is,

33:30.917 --> 33:32.442
we could do that
to the other hand,

33:32.542 --> 33:35.692
and then go down
to your feet...

33:35.792 --> 33:36.859
Actually, we
could work up,

33:36.959 --> 33:39.276
piece by piece,
all the way to her head.

33:39.376 --> 33:42.334
Where is Prue?

33:44.583 --> 33:49.292
I just couldn't leave
like that, Piper.

33:50.418 --> 33:51.959
Oh!

33:53.001 --> 33:54.442
What's going on?

33:54.542 --> 33:57.442
Well, you just
helped her to escape.

33:57.542 --> 34:00.499
<i>That's</i> what's going on.

34:05.709 --> 34:07.499

Not any more.

34:37.958 --> 34:40.667
Not after this.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.817
(<i>eerie voice whispering</i>)

34:46.917 --> 34:48.376
(<i>gasps</i>)

34:49.376 --> 34:52.817
Welcome to my hell.

34:52.917 --> 34:54.442
So what are we
supposed to do now?

34:54.542 --> 34:56.609
I don't know.
Kill innocents?

34:56.708 --> 34:57.901
No, I mean about Prue.

34:58.001 --> 34:59.901
How are we supposed
to find her without the Book?

35:00.001 --> 35:03.984
Shouldn't you be mourning
the loss of your beloved Leo?

35:04.084 --> 35:05.234
Oh, Phoebe, I'm serious.

35:05.334 --> 35:07.109
That was one
pissed-off priestess,

35:07.209 --> 35:08.151
and if she kills Prue,

35:08.251 --> 35:11.026
she takes the evil power
of three along with her

35:11.126 --> 35:12.359
and we won't stand a chance.

35:12.459 --> 35:13.151
Good point.

35:13.251 --> 35:14.750
We have to find Prue.

35:15.459 --> 35:16.567
Wait a minute.

35:16.667 --> 35:17.399
We're warlocks, right?

35:17.499 --> 35:20.318
We should be able to
blink wherever we want.

35:20.418 --> 35:21.817
But we don't know
where to blink to.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.525
We don't have
to know where.

35:23.625 --> 35:25.067
Just to who.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.234
To Prue.

35:26.334 --> 35:28.400
I mean, isn't that how
Leo's orbing power worked?

35:28.500 --> 35:30.318
Yeah, but his power
was jammed.

35:30.418 --> 35:31.318
He couldn't find her.

35:31.418 --> 35:33.318
That's because he was good.

35:33.418 --> 35:34.834
And we're evil.

35:36.126 --> 35:38.483
"Through this book,
weave this spell,

35:38.583 --> 35:40.984
"create the pain
of heaven to hell

35:41.084 --> 35:44.026
may she suffer.."
Whoa.

35:44.126 --> 35:46.042
We there yet?

35:46.709 --> 35:48.399
Prue.
Too late.

35:48.499 --> 35:49.483
I've got the Book.

35:49.583 --> 35:51.234
Yeah, well, you know
it takes a while

35:51.334 --> 35:52.650
to learn how to use it.
Trust us.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.399
How about, in the meantime,

35:54.499 --> 35:56.567
I freeze your head
and shatter it?

35:56.667 --> 35:58.026
"Exmor dimpress anamatoom."

35:58.126 --> 36:03.667
I may not be powerful enough
to fight you yet, but they are.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.399
PIPER:
Whoa, Prue...

36:09.499 --> 36:10.276
Hey, hi.

36:10.376 --> 36:11.234
You don't look
so good.

36:11.334 --> 36:12.901
Oh, but that's a great dress.

36:13.001 --> 36:15.875
DANTALIAN:
Zile, Prue,
eliminate them.

36:16.750 --> 36:17.692
Prue, ignore her.

36:17.792 --> 36:18.817
Come on,
come with us.

36:18.917 --> 36:19.817
We're your sisters.

36:19.917 --> 36:22.834
I'm his wife, not your sister.

36:32.499 --> 36:35.109
All right,
I'll take that as a "no."

36:35.209 --> 36:39.151
Okay, we have to figure out
a way to get Prue on our side

36:39.251 --> 36:39.734
and fast.

36:39.834 --> 36:41.709
How about we get her a divorce?

36:51.499 --> 36:52.901
Don't want to shatter

36:53.001 --> 36:55.667
the wrong sister now, do you?

36:59.084 --> 37:00.399
I love you.

37:00.499 --> 37:01.775
You, too.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.359
Welcome to planet Narcissus.

37:04.459 --> 37:05.483
Wait a minute--

37:05.583 --> 37:07.901
Cole said that evil can't love.

37:08.001 --> 37:08.692
Cole?!

37:08.792 --> 37:10.399
Uh, never mind.
The point is

37:10.499 --> 37:12.499
she didn't say
"I love you, too."

37:18.126 --> 37:20.583
Uh, she's the warlock,
freeze her!

37:23.499 --> 37:25.399
Well, shatter her,
hurry!

37:25.499 --> 37:26.734
No!

37:26.834 --> 37:28.792
Die!

37:32.376 --> 37:33.483
What's going on?

37:33.583 --> 37:36.499
I think we're back.

37:37.459 --> 37:38.817
All of us.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.542
(<i>squeals</i>)

37:44.167 --> 37:45.026
The Book is back, too.

37:45.126 --> 37:48.334
Let's go do something
good with it.

37:53.709 --> 37:55.399
"Powers of light,
magic of right,

37:55.499 --> 37:58.500
cast this blight
into forever's night."

38:00.167 --> 38:04.376
(<i>wailing</i>)

38:06.459 --> 38:07.276
Well,

38:07.376 --> 38:09.399
that was the wedding from hell.

38:09.499 --> 38:10.525
Although...

38:10.625 --> 38:13.984
I guess I was the first
to get married, after all.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.483
Oh, no-- Leo.

38:16.583 --> 38:17.399
What?

38:17.499 --> 38:20.499
We killed him.

38:33.917 --> 38:35.483
(<i>sobbing</i>)

38:35.583 --> 38:38.359
Oh, Leo.

38:38.459 --> 38:40.084
(<i>sobs</i>)

38:52.499 --> 38:55.984
Oh, thank God you're okay.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.376
Actually, it had more to do
with what you guys did.

39:00.376 --> 39:01.692
Vanquishing Zile broke the bond

39:01.792 --> 39:05.399
and reversed all
the evil you had done.

39:05.499 --> 39:06.399
PHOEBE:
I just hope

39:06.499 --> 39:07.984
the wedding planners
don't remember

39:08.084 --> 39:08.859
what we did to them.

39:08.959 --> 39:09.942
Unfortunately, they will.

39:10.042 --> 39:13.499
But I doubt they'll
believe what happened.

39:14.126 --> 39:17.399
And, unfortunately, you will.

39:17.499 --> 39:19.067
PHOEBE:
Oh, yeah, Leo,

39:19.167 --> 39:20.692
sorry we killed you.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.399
It's okay, Phoebe.

39:22.499 --> 39:26.399
It wasn't the real you--
or you, Piper.

39:26.499 --> 39:27.399
PRUE:
Wasn't it?

39:27.499 --> 39:30.775
I mean, on some level,
it was me, I felt it.

39:30.875 --> 39:31.399
They didn't just

39:31.499 --> 39:35.359
plant evil inside of me
or us for that matter.

39:35.459 --> 39:38.399
There had to be something there
for them to turn to begin with.

39:38.499 --> 39:40.399
LEO:
That doesn't make
you evil, Prue.

39:40.499 --> 39:43.499
You have to choose to be evil
voluntarily.

39:44.499 --> 39:45.901
Well, I got to admit it--

39:46.001 --> 39:47.318
it was kind of fun.

39:47.418 --> 39:48.650
Phoebe.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.067
Well, it was fun for a while.

39:50.167 --> 39:52.109
I mean, to be able to
do whatever we wanted,

39:52.209 --> 39:54.817
whenever we wanted,
with no consequences.

39:54.917 --> 39:56.192
My fiancÃ© being

39:56.292 --> 39:58.442
shattered into
a gazillion pieces

39:58.542 --> 40:00.525
is a kind of
consequence.

40:00.625 --> 40:01.399
Thank you.
Mm.

40:01.499 --> 40:05.459
Still, I kind of understand
what Phoebe's saying.

40:06.625 --> 40:08.875
Wait, you do?

40:09.750 --> 40:12.942
Oh, am I detecting
a thaw in our rift?

40:13.042 --> 40:15.775
All I'm saying is
if evil weren't enticing,

40:15.875 --> 40:17.067
why would there be any?

40:17.167 --> 40:17.578
I mean, you know,

40:17.588 --> 40:19.692
to pretend that
we're never attracted to it is,

40:19.792 --> 40:22.399
it's like pretending
that it just doesn't exist.

40:22.499 --> 40:23.483
Uh-oh.
Something tells me

40:23.583 --> 40:24.859
Cole's name is about
to be brought up.

40:24.959 --> 40:26.817
Look, I definitely
do not like the fact

40:26.917 --> 40:29.692
that you lied to us
about vanquishing him.

40:29.792 --> 40:30.567
But I have to admit

40:30.667 --> 40:32.399
after taking a trip
down the dark side,

40:32.499 --> 40:35.399
I sort of understand it
a little bit better.

40:35.499 --> 40:36.276
The problem now

40:36.376 --> 40:40.525
is that I realize that Justin
is just so boring.

40:40.625 --> 40:42.399
LEO:
Well, scratch
one name

40:42.499 --> 40:43.650
off the wedding guest list.

40:43.750 --> 40:47.026
Actually, scratch them all.

40:47.126 --> 40:48.234
I cave.

40:48.334 --> 40:48.942
Our lives are just

40:49.042 --> 40:50.192
way too bizarre
to have

40:50.292 --> 40:51.942
any sort of normal wedding.

40:52.042 --> 40:53.650
I don't know
what I was thinking.

40:53.750 --> 40:54.400
Phoebe, by the way,

40:54.500 --> 40:58.276
you never mentioned where you
got that premonition from.

40:58.376 --> 40:59.650
What premonition?

40:59.750 --> 41:02.499
The one that told us
about Dantalian?

41:02.875 --> 41:04.442
The one that saved our butts?

41:04.542 --> 41:06.400
Right.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.525
Um, you know, something tells me

41:07.625 --> 41:10.399
that you wouldn't believe me
if I told you, anyway,

41:10.499 --> 41:12.984
so, let's just say

41:13.084 --> 41:17.001
I got in touch
with my evil side.

41:17.499 --> 41:20.376
Something that
I will never do again.

41:38.499 --> 41:40.276
How'd it go?

41:40.376 --> 41:42.650
Everything's back
to normal again.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.483
Good.

41:44.583 --> 41:47.399
Yeah.

41:47.499 --> 41:50.418
Good.

41:51.792 --> 41:53.499
It's not enough, is it?

41:54.499 --> 41:54.942
What I did

41:55.042 --> 41:57.399
doesn't change your mind
about us, does it?

41:57.499 --> 42:00.067
No.

42:00.167 --> 42:00.775
Why not?

42:00.875 --> 42:03.192
It's too complicated.

42:03.292 --> 42:03.829
Oh, don't give me that.

42:03.839 --> 42:06.567
If nothing else, let's at least
be honest with each other.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.084
We owe that.

42:09.834 --> 42:11.499
Uh...

42:12.667 --> 42:15.499
I love you.

42:16.959 --> 42:19.399
And I will always love you.

42:19.499 --> 42:21.667
Nothing can change that.

42:22.917 --> 42:26.192
It's just...

42:26.292 --> 42:28.399
the temptation, it's too much.

42:28.499 --> 42:31.234
And I can't take
that risk

42:31.334 --> 42:33.399
for me or my sisters.

42:33.499 --> 42:36.399
Phoebe, I'm telling you,
I'm not evil any more.

42:36.499 --> 42:38.499
Maybe not
on the surface.

42:39.792 --> 42:43.625
And maybe not even
in your heart.

42:45.167 --> 42:51.109
But somewhere inside of you...

42:51.209 --> 42:53.499
you will always be.

42:54.834 --> 42:57.750
And you can't ever change that.

43:09.709 --> 43:12.001
Good-bye.

43:15.917 --> 43:17.709
I'm not giving up, Phoebe.

43:20.126 --> 43:21.709
(<i>door opens</i>)

43:23.917 --> 43:24.942
(<i>door closes</i>)

43:25.042 --> 43:27.499
(<i>softly</i>):
I'm not going away.
