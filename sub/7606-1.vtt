00:46.390 --> 00:47.982
Oh, my God.

00:48.159 --> 00:50.423
You are single-handedly ruining my life.

00:50.595 --> 00:52.085
You have to be kidding me.

00:52.263 --> 00:54.697
- We're serious about this, Massie.
- So am I.

00:54.866 --> 00:56.007
I already
made plans.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.593
This party isn't just a party.

00:58.769 --> 01:00.896
It's the last party
before winter break's over.

01:01.072 --> 01:04.269
Forget being the event of the season,
it's the event of all four.

01:04.441 --> 01:06.342
The Lyons are gonna be here for dinner.

01:06.510 --> 01:07.534
The Lyons?

01:07.712 --> 01:10.203
Are the tigers and bears coming too?
Oh, my.

01:10.381 --> 01:12.781
Massie, we talked about this weeks ago.

01:12.950 --> 01:15.942
You remember Jay?
My best friend from business school?

01:17.154 --> 01:19.554
He's moving up here from Florida
with his family.

01:20.491 --> 01:23.790
They have a son, Todd,
a daughter, Claire. She's your age?

01:24.095 --> 01:26.825
They'll stay out in the guesthouse
until they find a place.

01:26.998 --> 01:29.831
Does any of this
even ring the smallest of bells?

01:30.001 --> 01:31.696
Uh, no.

01:32.169 --> 01:35.332
- You'll be at dinner and you'll be pleasant.
- Mom.

01:35.506 --> 01:37.974
You always said I should honor
my commitments, right?

01:38.342 --> 01:40.742
Well, I made a verbal commitment
to Shelby Rexler...

01:40.912 --> 01:43.176
...that I would be at her party tonight.

01:43.648 --> 01:45.377
I'm not discussing this anymore.

01:45.549 --> 01:47.779
- Dad.
- You heard your mother.

01:47.952 --> 01:51.479
Mom, if I miss this,
it'd be starting the second semester...

01:51.656 --> 01:53.521
...on the completely wrong foot.

01:53.691 --> 01:58.321
Worse than the wrong foot.
It'd be like wearing the wrong outfit.

02:02.266 --> 02:04.393
Bean, tell me this isn't happening.

02:04.902 --> 02:06.927
This is my worst nightmare.

02:07.104 --> 02:09.572
Worse than the one
where my Amex was rejected.

02:09.740 --> 02:12.174
Worse than the one
where I lost my Prada bag.

02:12.944 --> 02:14.741
And look.

02:15.780 --> 02:19.079
I already had my outfit picked out
and everything.

02:20.885 --> 02:24.878
If I have to miss this,
everyone has to miss this.

02:30.127 --> 02:31.185
Hey.

02:31.362 --> 02:33.296
Put the brush down.
I'm getting Dylan.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.758
I was just about to call you.
I'm in a wardrobe crisis.

02:38.936 --> 02:41.496
- Hey, Dyl.
- Hey, Alicia. Ow!

02:41.672 --> 02:43.435
- I'll get Kristen.
- She's school shopping.

02:43.607 --> 02:45.370
She's already called me three times...

02:45.543 --> 02:47.738
...to ask if we need
a compass and a protractor.

02:47.912 --> 02:49.812
- What did you tell her?
- To get a life.

02:51.148 --> 02:54.675
Mass, look, I can't talk right now.
Did you get a compass and a protractor?

02:54.852 --> 02:56.615
Who cares?
P.S. Leesh and Dyl on the line.

02:56.787 --> 02:57.811
- Hey, girlies.
- Hi.

02:57.989 --> 02:59.684
- Hey.
- Okay.

02:59.857 --> 03:04.760
So, what I'm about to tell you
is gonna score me major gossip points.

03:04.929 --> 03:10.299
Like Shelby Rexler did not chop her hair off
to look more like Keira Knightley.

03:10.468 --> 03:13.164
- She has head lice.
- Ew! Gross.

03:13.337 --> 03:15.134
I know. I say we bag the party.

03:15.306 --> 03:18.400
There's no way I'm trading
my Frédéric Fekkai for Nix.

03:18.576 --> 03:21.636
But it's an 8th-grade party
and we're the only 7th graders invited.

03:21.812 --> 03:23.643
Please, I'm not gonna be caught dead...

03:23.814 --> 03:26.476
...at a party thrown by anyone
under the age of 15.

03:26.650 --> 03:28.618
It's worse than wearing Crocs.

03:28.786 --> 03:32.779
- Wait, head lice and Crocs?
- No one's actually wearing Crocs, Dyl.

03:32.957 --> 03:36.324
Actually, I think Shelby has a pair
in orange.

03:36.494 --> 03:37.620
Ew!

03:37.795 --> 03:39.456
- Forget it, I'm out.
- Me too.

03:39.630 --> 03:41.461
Me three.

03:41.632 --> 03:43.691
That's what I thought.

03:51.709 --> 03:54.507
Mass, the Lyons will be here soon.
You might wanna change.

03:54.678 --> 03:56.976
Can I change the fact
that they're gonna be here?

03:57.148 --> 03:58.775
Look, I'll make a deal with you.

03:58.949 --> 04:01.417
If you adjust your attitude,
be nice to Claire...

04:01.585 --> 04:05.180
- Who's Claire?
- The Lyons' daughter.

04:05.356 --> 04:09.122
Be nice to her and I'll let you go
to the end of Shelby's party.

04:09.293 --> 04:12.126
Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

04:12.296 --> 04:14.856
Now, go get changed.

04:20.671 --> 04:21.695
Bean.

04:23.441 --> 04:24.840
Bean, chill.

04:47.064 --> 04:49.931
Dad, how many people live here?

04:50.101 --> 04:51.728
Is this really our new house?

04:59.810 --> 05:03.871
Bean, what's one step worse
than a fashion don't?

05:06.517 --> 05:08.451
A fashion don't-even-think-about-it.

05:08.619 --> 05:09.745
They're here.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.649
I'm not even ready yet.

05:11.856 --> 05:13.221
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:13.390 --> 05:16.882
Oh, look. Hey.

05:17.061 --> 05:18.085
You made it.

05:18.262 --> 05:19.854
Good to see you.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.464
- How are you, buddy?
- Oh, you got so big.

05:29.740 --> 05:31.037
What do you think, Bean?

05:32.076 --> 05:33.839
Perfect, right?

05:36.881 --> 05:38.746
Oh, so good to see you.

05:41.652 --> 05:43.916
There she is, perfect timing.

05:44.655 --> 05:47.886
- This is our daughter, Massie.
- Hi, my parents told me all about you.

05:48.726 --> 05:50.250
Mine barely mentioned you.

05:51.962 --> 05:53.987
Except to say how fun and cool you are.

05:58.169 --> 06:00.637
Uh, hello?
She's a dog, not a baseball glove.

06:04.708 --> 06:05.834
Hey, come here.

06:06.010 --> 06:08.274
Sorry, he must have forgotten
to take his meds.

06:08.779 --> 06:10.303
Meds?

06:10.481 --> 06:12.813
That was a joke.

06:15.119 --> 06:16.143
Funny.

06:17.655 --> 06:20.021
Good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

06:23.827 --> 06:26.159
This is delicious.

06:33.537 --> 06:35.767
Claire helped pick that out.

06:39.176 --> 06:40.302
Sorry.

06:44.215 --> 06:45.648
It's for your charm bracelet.

06:45.816 --> 06:48.148
Really?
I never would've guessed, thanks.

06:50.354 --> 06:53.721
I remember your mom wrote
in a Christmas card one year...

06:53.891 --> 06:55.882
...that you wanted to be a singer?

06:56.060 --> 06:57.493
Right, when I was 7.

07:02.233 --> 07:04.827
Um. Thanks.

07:05.002 --> 07:07.527
So, Claire,
I hear you're a straight-A student.

07:07.705 --> 07:10.071
She was in the top three
in her science fair.

07:10.241 --> 07:13.210
And she won the district
spelling bee contest last year.

07:13.444 --> 07:15.002
Wow.

07:15.179 --> 07:16.578
That's very impressive, Claire.

07:16.747 --> 07:19.215
Why don't you tell Claire
about Octavian Country Day?

07:19.383 --> 07:21.283
Massie just loves OCD.

07:21.452 --> 07:23.249
- Right, Massie?
- Oh, right.

07:23.420 --> 07:27.015
Um, small classes,
nice teachers for the most part.

07:27.191 --> 07:29.386
There's only one problem. No boys.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.187
Who says that's a problem?

07:31.362 --> 07:32.852
The girls who go there, Dad.

07:36.900 --> 07:40.631
- Mr. Lyons, let me get that for you.
- Sure.

07:44.842 --> 07:46.537
You complete me.

07:46.710 --> 07:48.610
Ew.

07:50.347 --> 07:51.507
Excuse me.

07:57.721 --> 07:59.382
- They were still eating.
- Please.

07:59.556 --> 08:02.389
- You promised I could go to the party.
- A party?

08:02.559 --> 08:05.619
Thanks, Claire.
Maybe Claire would like to go with you.

08:05.796 --> 08:08.230
Oh, I'm up for, you know...

08:09.433 --> 08:11.094
Whatever.

08:13.437 --> 08:15.530
Sweetie, are you okay?

08:15.706 --> 08:16.900
Um...

08:17.074 --> 08:19.804
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.274
I don't feel so well.

08:24.415 --> 08:26.383
Night, Massie.
I hope it's nothing serious.

08:26.550 --> 08:29.451
Get some sleep, honey.
I'm sure it'll be gone in the morning.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.713
I seriously hope so.

08:31.889 --> 08:34.221
Did you see her clothes
and her shoes and her hair?

08:34.390 --> 08:36.951
I swear,
she looked straight out of a magazine.

08:37.126 --> 08:38.150
She is pretty cute.

08:38.328 --> 08:40.558
Could we go shopping
for the first day of school?

08:40.731 --> 08:43.393
What about the clothes we bought
before we left Florida?

08:43.567 --> 08:47.435
T.J. Maxx isn't gonna cut it here, Mom.
It's, like, designer everything.

08:48.806 --> 08:51.274
Please? I just wanna fit in.

08:51.442 --> 08:52.841
I really want her to like me.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.241
She's gonna like you because you're you,
not because of what you wear.

08:59.216 --> 09:00.740
All right, fine.

09:00.918 --> 09:02.909
I suppose we could use
a new sweater or two.

09:03.087 --> 09:04.554
It is pretty cold up here.

09:04.722 --> 09:07.555
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

09:20.003 --> 09:21.595
On your right.

09:21.772 --> 09:24.707
Hey, watch where you're going.

09:30.581 --> 09:33.049
Hey, isn't there a law
against texting and riding?

09:35.786 --> 09:37.515
- I'm Chris Abeley.
- I'm...

09:37.688 --> 09:39.246
Massie Block. I know who you are.

09:39.423 --> 09:40.447
- Really?
- Sure.

09:40.624 --> 09:44.025
I used to come to your parents'
charity auction practically every year.

09:44.194 --> 09:47.493
- I wonder why we've never met.
- I've been MIA the past couple of years.

09:47.664 --> 09:50.098
- In a boarding school in Connecticut.
- Sounds cliché.

09:50.267 --> 09:51.859
Yeah, so is getting kicked out.

09:52.035 --> 09:53.866
I'm back at Briarwood for high school.

09:54.037 --> 09:55.061
A bad boy, huh?

09:55.239 --> 09:57.799
I guess that explains
why you're on a private trail.

09:57.975 --> 10:00.569
Yeah, I must have made
a wrong turn somewhere.

10:01.278 --> 10:02.711
Or the right one.

10:04.014 --> 10:06.380
I should go.
I'll let you have your trail back.

10:06.550 --> 10:09.246
Oh, no, it's okay.
I love having guests, really.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.947
Maybe I'll see you back here.
I was thinking of riding again on Saturday.

10:13.157 --> 10:15.648
Sure. Maybe you'd wanna ride together?

10:15.826 --> 10:17.259
Sure, it's a date.

10:26.170 --> 10:29.071
Did you hear that, Brownie? It's a date.

10:36.914 --> 10:38.677
What about this?
- Mom.

10:38.849 --> 10:41.875
"At OCD, fashion is a fine art
and true form of self-expression."

10:42.052 --> 10:43.917
Okay, okay.

10:47.024 --> 10:48.651
These are perfect.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.785
Those are nice. Let's see.

10:53.597 --> 10:55.792
Ooh, 62 dollars.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.430
"Excellence isn't encouraged,
it's expected."

10:59.002 --> 11:01.129
- Expected, Mom.
- I'm sorry, honey.

11:01.305 --> 11:04.001
With the move and everything,
this is just too expensive.

11:04.174 --> 11:06.108
Well, can I just look next door?

11:06.944 --> 11:09.777
I'm not gonna buy anything,
I just wanna look for ideas.

11:12.282 --> 11:15.217
All right, fine, five minutes.
But then we're going to Old Navy.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.979
- They have a sale on turtlenecks...
- Okay, thanks, Mom.

11:49.553 --> 11:50.952
But they look great.

11:51.121 --> 11:54.090
- Well, I'm not getting you a size six.
- But I am a size six.

11:54.258 --> 11:57.989
Well, when you're a size four again,
I'll get you the pants.

11:58.161 --> 12:00.129
In every color.

12:05.302 --> 12:07.998
- Moms, they just don't get it.
- Right?

12:08.171 --> 12:09.832
Weren't they kids once too?

12:11.608 --> 12:13.974
I don't think they have a four
in this whole store.

12:14.144 --> 12:17.204
What about these? These are fours.

12:20.384 --> 12:23.615
If I try and fit into these,
I won't be able to breathe.

12:25.355 --> 12:27.186
Why don't you switch the tags?

12:27.357 --> 12:30.292
Then, your mom thinks you're buying
a four when you're buying a six.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.621
Then your mom's happy
and you can exhale.

12:34.164 --> 12:35.495
You're brilliant.

12:35.666 --> 12:37.327
- I'm Dylan.
- Claire.

12:38.502 --> 12:41.027
- We walked in on some dude.
- Trying on women's clothes.

12:41.204 --> 12:42.831
- No.
- Come on.

12:43.006 --> 12:46.635
Oh, nice meeting you, Claire.
And thanks.

12:55.586 --> 12:58.646
Since excellence is expected.

13:05.395 --> 13:08.262
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:17.474 --> 13:21.001
"Good girls go to Orlando.
Bad girls go to Miami."

13:22.412 --> 13:24.175
Where do ugly girls like you go?

13:26.149 --> 13:29.516
Claire, Mrs. Block said
that you can go to school with Massie.

13:31.021 --> 13:34.115
You should meet the driver
in front of the house at 7:30.

13:36.393 --> 13:40.022
Their driver's going to
take me to school?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.027
You must be Claire.

13:45.202 --> 13:46.829
Hi, Isaac.

13:47.604 --> 13:49.231
Thanks.

13:59.549 --> 14:01.278
Wow.

14:04.154 --> 14:07.021
God, Claire, you scared me.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.283
You shouldn't sneak up on people
like that.

14:09.459 --> 14:10.824
Sorry.

14:10.994 --> 14:12.427
Oh, it's fine.

14:12.596 --> 14:15.497
Do you mind sitting in the back?
We have to pick up a few more.

14:15.666 --> 14:17.634
Oh, sure.

14:35.285 --> 14:38.982
Relax, Claire. This isn't Epcot.

14:39.156 --> 14:42.489
I swear, celebs are getting more DUIs
than Ksubi jeans.

14:43.093 --> 14:48.087
Hm. Moschino dress, Alice and Olivia
jacket, Michael Kors handbag.

14:48.265 --> 14:50.426
Adorable, 8.5.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.500
Thank you.

14:59.443 --> 15:00.637
- Wait.
- Dylan?

15:00.811 --> 15:02.210
Claire, right?

15:02.379 --> 15:04.813
- You two know each other?
- From the mall.

15:04.981 --> 15:07.108
Claire had that brilliant idea
about the pants.

15:07.284 --> 15:09.479
When my mom was being a jerk
to the 10th degree.

15:09.653 --> 15:12.918
And then Dylan's friends came out
and started screaming about some guy.

15:13.090 --> 15:14.557
Yeah, those are my friends too.

15:14.725 --> 15:18.991
And FYI, that story's more last week
than white skinny jeans.

15:19.162 --> 15:21.926
Claire's the girl I told you about.

15:22.099 --> 15:23.726
The one living in my guesthouse...

15:23.900 --> 15:27.336
...because her parents
can't afford anything else right now.

15:29.973 --> 15:31.338
Gummi Feet?

15:31.508 --> 15:35.501
- Thanks, but I don't eat sugar.
- And I don't eat feet.

15:51.962 --> 15:53.953
- Hey.
- What's up, <i>chica?</i>

15:54.131 --> 15:57.589
Hey, girl.
Vintage Ralph Lauren, 9.

15:57.768 --> 16:00.396
Well, you're a 10. You look amazing.

16:00.570 --> 16:03.232
- Just wait till tomorrow.
- Why?

16:03.406 --> 16:07.740
Because you get better-looking
every day.

16:11.948 --> 16:13.347
Hey, guys.

16:13.517 --> 16:17.078
Somebody call the fashion police.
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

16:20.390 --> 16:21.789
Finally.

16:50.620 --> 16:55.023
Seriously, Kris, when is your mom
gonna let you wear what you want?

16:55.192 --> 16:56.216
My question first.

16:56.393 --> 16:59.726
One, why does it smell
like first-class airline food?

16:59.896 --> 17:03.161
I started the Circle diet today. Sorry.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.667
And two, who's the stowaway?

17:08.038 --> 17:10.131
Oh, my God.
Has she been there the whole time?

17:10.707 --> 17:12.571
That's Claire.

17:13.210 --> 17:14.233
Do we like her?

17:14.778 --> 17:16.301
No.

17:36.099 --> 17:37.760
Isaac?

17:38.802 --> 17:41.600
Claire, sorry.

17:42.038 --> 17:43.835
Thanks.

18:13.370 --> 18:15.463
Hey, Mass.
We missed you guys Saturday night.

18:15.639 --> 18:18.665
The party was completely unbloggable
without you.

18:18.842 --> 18:19.866
I know.

18:20.043 --> 18:23.012
We heard
you had some unexpected visitors.

18:24.347 --> 18:27.373
Oh, my God, Jenna Dressler's
wearing her Chihuahua shirt again.

18:28.184 --> 18:30.118
Hey, you guys.
How was your winter break?

18:30.287 --> 18:33.188
Massie, I heard you have an NBF
from Florida.

18:33.356 --> 18:37.053
False. If I had a new best friend,
she'd be here right now.

18:37.227 --> 18:39.991
- She is so off my top eight.
- She was in your top eight?

18:45.335 --> 18:46.461
Ow!

18:46.636 --> 18:49.469
Juicy Couture sweat suit.
No punch backs.

18:49.639 --> 18:52.437
Wait, I lost an earring.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.975
Nobody move!

18:55.645 --> 18:58.808
I need to retrace. Fan out, people.

19:09.392 --> 19:11.417
Hey, look out.

19:13.363 --> 19:15.024
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

19:15.198 --> 19:16.790
Are you okay?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.224
I'm so sorry.

19:18.501 --> 19:19.559
I was rushing.

19:20.136 --> 19:23.469
My sister, she forgot her thermos
so I had to run all the way back here.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.335
And I didn't even...

19:26.576 --> 19:27.975
Are you sure you're okay?

19:28.979 --> 19:30.310
I'm sure.

19:31.114 --> 19:32.376
I'm Chris Abeley.

19:32.682 --> 19:35.412
I'm Claire Something.

19:36.086 --> 19:38.418
Nice to meet you, Claire Something.

19:49.933 --> 19:52.458
- What are you doing?
- Uh, anger management much?

19:52.635 --> 19:55.103
Hello! I can't wear one earring.
I'll look like Johnny Depp.

19:55.305 --> 19:56.863
- But wasn't that a diamond?
- Ugh!

19:57.040 --> 20:00.737
Hey. Uh...
Do you guys know where Room 41 is?

20:02.078 --> 20:06.014
Yeah, um, turn around
and go out these double doors.

20:06.182 --> 20:07.206
Take a cab to JFK...

20:07.384 --> 20:10.148
...and get on the next flight
to wherever you came from.

20:10.487 --> 20:12.478
Latte, anyone?

20:12.856 --> 20:14.323
I don't get it. What's going on?

20:14.491 --> 20:17.324
Claire, did I invite you to my BBQ?

20:17.494 --> 20:21.191
- Um. No.
- Then why are you all up in my grill?

20:24.067 --> 20:26.126
I don't get it.
Why are you being like this?

20:26.536 --> 20:29.266
Like what, Claire? What am I being like?

20:30.073 --> 20:31.438
Like...

20:32.175 --> 20:34.143
I don't know, a bitch?

20:37.213 --> 20:38.441
What did you just call me?

20:39.749 --> 20:41.512
Nothing. I mean...

20:42.318 --> 20:43.808
Nothing.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.418
- I can't believe she just said that.
- She called you a bitch to your face.

20:54.597 --> 20:56.997
- Mass, what are you gonna do to her?
- I don't know.

20:57.167 --> 21:00.568
All I know is that Claire Lyons
should consider herself done, done...

21:00.737 --> 21:01.897
...and you know else?

21:02.072 --> 21:03.539
Done.

21:20.523 --> 21:22.855
Do you need a personal invitation
to come in?

21:23.226 --> 21:25.694
Give me your e-mail,
I'll send you an Evite.

21:26.029 --> 21:27.997
Sorry I'm late. I got a little lost.

21:28.164 --> 21:29.791
And you are?

21:29.966 --> 21:32.560
- I'm Claire, I'm new.
- I'm Vincent, I'm old.

21:32.735 --> 21:35.602
But you know what they say,
32 is the new 22.

21:36.573 --> 21:38.507
My likes include Broadway musicals...

21:38.675 --> 21:40.939
...piña coladas
and taking long walks in the rain.

21:41.511 --> 21:44.139
And my dislikes are...
Now, what were they again?

21:44.314 --> 21:46.942
Oh, yeah, tardiness.

21:48.418 --> 21:50.352
There's a seat by the window.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.551
And Miss Rivera,
this isn't the changing room at Saks.

21:53.723 --> 21:55.418
Make room.

21:55.925 --> 21:58.120
Claire, I've seen paint dry faster.

21:58.294 --> 22:00.626
Chop, chop. Chop squared, please.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.890
Okay, you have your materials
in front of you.

22:03.066 --> 22:07.628
You have 15 minutes
to paint this as still life.

22:19.582 --> 22:22.107
I think I'm gonna use some of that too.

22:23.486 --> 22:26.922
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Is there a problem, ladies?

22:27.090 --> 22:28.114
- No.
- No.

22:54.584 --> 22:57.246
Do you think I could start over?
I'm not good at this yet.

22:57.420 --> 23:00.116
Commit to your work, Miss Lyons.
This is a lesson for life.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.884
Once you start something,
you need to stick with it.

23:05.361 --> 23:07.352
Oh, my God. Miss Lyons.

23:07.797 --> 23:10.960
Here's a pass to the nurse.

23:11.134 --> 23:12.795
And take your books with you.

23:12.969 --> 23:14.664
- I feel fine.
- Just go.

24:05.121 --> 24:07.385
Hey, Claire. You look a little lost.

24:07.557 --> 24:10.287
- I'm supposed to go to the nurse's office.
- Easy.

24:10.493 --> 24:13.553
Follow this hall all the way down,
past the main office and gym.

24:13.730 --> 24:16.665
Take a right at the band room.
It's the first door on the right.

24:16.833 --> 24:20.269
Be sure to be loud when you go in.
Nurse Adele's a little hard of hearing.

24:20.436 --> 24:23.371
- Thanks, Dylan, I really appreciate it.
- My pleasure.

24:36.119 --> 24:38.212
Breathe into your power house.

24:38.388 --> 24:40.253
In...

24:40.623 --> 24:43.251
...and out.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.926
Nurse Adele?

24:48.031 --> 24:51.194
Nurse Adele's office
is on the other side of the school...

24:51.367 --> 24:52.959
...by the art wing.

24:53.136 --> 24:54.228
But I was just there.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.466
Ladies.

25:09.118 --> 25:11.245
Re-center.

25:14.891 --> 25:16.654
Can I help you with something, dear?

25:17.260 --> 25:21.321
Um. I don't know.
I'm not really sure why I'm here.

25:21.497 --> 25:23.362
Vincent told me to come.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.664
Don't worry. Got your period.

25:29.205 --> 25:30.934
No, I didn't. What?

25:32.008 --> 25:34.340
Look at the back of your jeans.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.440
How is this possible?

25:40.850 --> 25:42.977
- I don't...
- Be right back.

25:51.227 --> 25:54.594
Alicia, red paint.

25:54.764 --> 25:57.995
Don't worry, dear.
This is also the lost and found.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.499
Go through
and pick out something you like.

26:00.670 --> 26:02.103
- Really?
- Really.

26:02.271 --> 26:03.295
Whatever you want.

26:03.473 --> 26:07.034
These girls want nothing to do
with last season's clothes, trust me.

26:42.645 --> 26:44.010
Hey, cool top.

26:44.614 --> 26:46.673
I had the same one but I lost it.

26:49.485 --> 26:52.784
Looks like someone went shopping
at Nursestrom's today.

26:52.955 --> 26:55.753
Seven's so three years ago.

26:55.925 --> 27:01.989
<i>Loser, loser, double loser, whatever,</i>
<i>as if, get the picture, duh.</i>

27:05.535 --> 27:08.436
- Ow! What the...?
- Juicy hoodie, no punch backs.

27:08.604 --> 27:10.663
Now, lean in. I've got major gossip.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.172
- How many points is it worth?
- None, it's about me.

27:13.342 --> 27:15.503
Why didn't you tell us in the car?

27:17.847 --> 27:20.441
- There is a reason I was MIA yesterday.
- MIA?

27:20.616 --> 27:24.416
Missing in Armani?
I was being asked out on a date.

27:24.587 --> 27:26.680
- By a boy?
- As opposed to who?

27:26.856 --> 27:29.518
- Yes, a boy, a Briarwood boy.
- No.

27:29.692 --> 27:32.593
- Yes, he's a freshman in high school.
- Shut up.

27:32.762 --> 27:33.888
His name's Chris Abeley.

27:34.063 --> 27:36.361
We have to do some major recon
after school today.

27:36.532 --> 27:38.625
No, I don't know.
I have a ton of homework.

27:38.801 --> 27:42.897
You cannot be stressed out about school.
It's only the first day after winter break.

27:43.072 --> 27:45.734
I have to come up with
the Women in the Workforce project.

27:45.908 --> 27:48.206
I have to have a business plan
and a budget.

27:48.377 --> 27:50.311
It's worth, like, 60 percent of my grade.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.938
Does anyone wanna trade
for something edible?

27:54.617 --> 27:56.278
Ask her.

27:59.188 --> 28:01.122
You guys, I feel bad.

28:01.491 --> 28:03.482
Maybe we could pull up a chair?

28:06.963 --> 28:09.625
That was Clairious.

28:24.247 --> 28:27.444
Okay, so I called Isaac to meet us
here at Briarwood at 4:30.

28:27.617 --> 28:29.915
- So we have to hurry.
- Tell that to Chris Abeley.

28:30.086 --> 28:32.350
By the way, micro-mini?
So not good for spying.

28:32.522 --> 28:34.717
Quiet.
Hey, what happened to the diet?

28:34.891 --> 28:36.984
I'm starving.
It's either this or my left arm.

28:37.159 --> 28:38.183
It's 4:15.

28:38.361 --> 28:40.921
- Chris Abeley will be here, don't worry.
- Who's worried?

28:41.097 --> 28:44.225
Hear about the New York City field trip
to the Museum of Modern Art?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.994
Vincent's taking
the whole seventh grade.

28:49.071 --> 28:50.197
It's Chris Abeley.

28:50.373 --> 28:52.068
There's Chris Abeley.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.843
I want to, but I don't know.

28:55.278 --> 28:56.302
Oh...

28:56.479 --> 28:57.969
- My...
- God.

29:01.417 --> 29:03.317
Look at him, look at him, look at him.

29:07.957 --> 29:10.983
He's coming this way.
Chris Abeley is coming this way.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.185
Get down.

29:14.163 --> 29:16.688
I got at least three or four hours
of homework tonight.

29:16.866 --> 29:19.357
- Really? You do?
- Yeah, it's not even funny.

29:20.870 --> 29:22.599
Shh!

29:32.014 --> 29:34.539
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

29:43.726 --> 29:46.320
Hey, how was your first day?

29:46.495 --> 29:47.757
Good.

29:52.468 --> 29:55.335
- Hey, whose clothes are those?
- Oh.

29:55.504 --> 29:57.301
Massie's. You know Massie.

29:57.473 --> 30:00.499
She keeps, like, three changes
of backup clothes in her locker.

30:00.676 --> 30:03.042
She wanted me to be dressed
more like her.

30:03.946 --> 30:05.743
Oh.

30:05.915 --> 30:08.782
Well, maybe we should return
your new jeans, then, huh?

30:08.951 --> 30:10.851
You can't.

30:11.020 --> 30:15.081
I spilled paint all over them in art class.
I'm sorry, Mom, I know you spent a lot.

30:15.257 --> 30:17.054
Oh, no, come on, honey, that's okay.

30:17.226 --> 30:19.456
I mean, it's just pants.
It's no big deal.

30:20.863 --> 30:23.058
I'm just glad you and Massie
are hitting it off.

30:24.266 --> 30:25.528
<i>I hate her.</i>

30:25.768 --> 30:27.201
Claire.

30:27.370 --> 30:31.170
She sits there like this perfect,
wide-eyed, innocent goody two-shoes.

30:31.340 --> 30:33.535
Meanwhile,
she's trying to be BFFs with Dylan...

30:33.709 --> 30:36.041
...and she's throwing herself
at Chris Abeley behind my back.

30:36.212 --> 30:40.273
You can't just drive into someone else's
town and live in someone else's house...

30:40.449 --> 30:42.940
...and try to take over
someone else's friends, right?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.350
I mean, what's next?

30:51.527 --> 30:55.429
She's gonna change her last name to Block
and move into my bedroom?

30:58.534 --> 31:00.764
I may live on 4.6 acres of property...

31:00.936 --> 31:03.996
...but there is no way
that it's big enough for me and...

31:11.981 --> 31:14.575
Can't believe your lips are still red
from those cherries.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.980
I know. Aren't they luscious?

31:17.153 --> 31:20.850
Whatev.
I just wish my lip gloss lasted that long.

31:21.023 --> 31:24.322
Actually, if you could sell that,
you could make a fortune.

31:24.493 --> 31:29.430
Lipstick that lasts 24 hours.
You can even wake up pretty.

31:30.599 --> 31:33.864
Oh, my God, that's it, Massie.
That's what I can do for my project.

31:34.036 --> 31:36.004
A makeup company.
You guys could help me.

31:36.505 --> 31:39.099
- Hey, yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm so smart.

31:39.275 --> 31:40.799
That really is a good idea.

31:40.976 --> 31:43.308
Conversation
between the taco and burrito, nacho.

31:43.479 --> 31:46.107
Anyways, we could make
everything ourselves, all natural.

31:46.282 --> 31:49.149
And edible. When you get bored of a color,
you could eat it.

31:49.318 --> 31:50.342
I heart that.

31:50.519 --> 31:53.283
We could sell it on that field trip
to New York on Saturday.

31:53.456 --> 31:56.789
- The whole class will be there.
- You guys, we need a great name.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.584
What about Homeworks?

31:58.761 --> 32:00.922
Because we make it at home.

32:01.097 --> 32:02.826
And it works.

32:03.365 --> 32:04.559
Homeworks?

32:04.734 --> 32:09.228
That makes us sound like losers who don't
have any friends and never go out, like:

32:14.477 --> 32:15.671
What about Glambition?

32:19.849 --> 32:22.317
It'll do until I think of something better.

32:22.485 --> 32:24.316
Oh, my God. We're gonna be so rich.

32:24.487 --> 32:27.012
Oh, please. We already are.

32:27.189 --> 32:29.384
- To Glambition.
- To Glambition.

32:43.105 --> 32:45.005
FYI, Claire.

32:45.174 --> 32:47.642
There are more girls than those girls
in this school.

32:47.810 --> 32:48.834
Go find them.

33:05.494 --> 33:07.428
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

33:18.307 --> 33:19.467
Is that real?

33:20.142 --> 33:22.110
I got this at CVS for a buck 20.

33:22.278 --> 33:23.506
Oh, well, you never know.

33:23.679 --> 33:26.648
For all I know,
those Picassos on the wall could be real.

33:26.816 --> 33:28.340
They are.

33:30.753 --> 33:32.243
I'm Layne.

33:32.421 --> 33:33.445
Claire, right?

33:33.622 --> 33:35.556
Yeah, you're new around here.
Word travels fast.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.589
Oh. Oatmeal?

33:37.760 --> 33:39.557
No, thanks. I'm trying to cut back.

33:42.398 --> 33:46.334
One day here and you're already dressed
like a pure Massie-chist.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.129
You guys friends?

33:50.773 --> 33:52.263
Um...

33:52.441 --> 33:53.772
Yeah, we kind of are.

33:55.177 --> 33:58.943
I didn't realize the Pretty Committee
was taking applications for new members.

34:02.685 --> 34:04.118
Hey, cool bag.

34:04.286 --> 34:06.345
It's a stereo. Fifty bucks, Spencer Gifts.

34:18.467 --> 34:20.992
- Oh, my God. That is so gross.
- What is she doing?

34:33.014 --> 34:35.279
Are you sure it's okay for you
to be sitting here?

34:35.451 --> 34:37.885
Massie looks pissed.

34:38.053 --> 34:40.817
She's fine. I told her, you know...

34:41.389 --> 34:43.620
...I can't hang out with only her
all the time.

34:48.764 --> 34:52.563
Yeah. She seems really jealous.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.661
I'll text her later.

34:56.938 --> 34:59.499
This is kind of random,
but you have plans Friday night?

34:59.675 --> 35:00.869
None.

35:01.043 --> 35:04.501
Hey, maybe we could watch a movie
or listen to my bag...

35:04.680 --> 35:06.580
...or something.

35:07.049 --> 35:08.812
That would be great.

35:16.859 --> 35:18.850
Hi there, everybody.
- Oh, hi.

35:19.028 --> 35:21.997
So, Claire, you're coming
to the sleepover Friday night, right?

35:22.164 --> 35:24.758
- I'm sorry?
- Massie's having all the usual suspects.

35:24.934 --> 35:26.902
Dylan, Alicia, Kristen.

35:27.269 --> 35:28.566
She wants me to come?

35:28.737 --> 35:30.364
Of course.
- I'll go.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.864
Sorry, Todd, no boys.

35:34.944 --> 35:36.343
- Wow, I'd love to come.
- Great.

35:36.512 --> 35:39.174
- Seven o'clock.
- Sounds great.

35:40.582 --> 35:43.517
- Maybe I'll invite my friends over too.
- You have friends?

35:44.420 --> 35:46.217
Don't you?

35:47.256 --> 35:48.655
I'm really sorry, Layne.

35:48.824 --> 35:52.885
My parents have to go out Friday night,
so I have to babysit my little brother.

35:53.062 --> 35:55.758
Maybe we can hang out another time?

35:57.700 --> 36:00.100
Great. Bye.

36:03.672 --> 36:05.367
- Yeah?
- I like it.

36:05.541 --> 36:06.974
- Isn't it awesome?
- Not.

36:07.142 --> 36:08.541
No.

36:09.345 --> 36:12.644
Seriously, this is, like,
'60s/medieval.

36:12.815 --> 36:14.612
- That's really cute.
- Seriously?

36:14.783 --> 36:17.081
- Check it out.
- For sure.

36:17.252 --> 36:18.276
- Ew.
- Ew.

36:18.454 --> 36:20.649
Get rid of it. It's nasty.

36:21.490 --> 36:23.117
Oh, God, no.

36:23.292 --> 36:24.987
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

36:25.160 --> 36:27.492
- Yeah, I...
- Well, you know...

36:27.663 --> 36:28.891
What are you doing here?

36:29.865 --> 36:31.423
I'm here for the sleepover.

36:34.136 --> 36:35.728
Hey, Claire.

36:36.171 --> 36:37.468
Okay, girls, break's over.

36:37.639 --> 36:40.767
Clothes you're donating
need to go in these boxes for the auction.

36:40.943 --> 36:42.035
What auction?

36:42.211 --> 36:45.009
We host the OCD auction
to raise money for scholarships.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.512
I know one local charity
that could use a donation.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.310
Massie, kitchen, now.

36:51.253 --> 36:53.983
- Hey, let's go down to the cabana.
- Yeah.

37:00.796 --> 37:03.424
Mom. How could you do this to me?

37:03.599 --> 37:05.863
I told you
if you didn't invite Claire, I would.

37:06.035 --> 37:08.936
- I didn't think you actually meant it.
- Just try to be nice.

37:09.104 --> 37:12.699
I did, but, Mom, you should see
how she treats me at school.

37:12.875 --> 37:16.311
She's not this nice, sweet, innocent girl
everyone makes her out to be.

37:16.478 --> 37:19.106
I know you, and there are always
two sides to your story.

37:19.281 --> 37:21.511
It'd be nice
if you took my side for a change.

37:21.683 --> 37:24.481
You need to take Bean for a walk.

37:39.802 --> 37:42.896
Um... I'm going down to the cabana.

37:43.338 --> 37:44.896
That's where we sleep.

37:45.074 --> 37:46.336
Come if you want.

37:48.510 --> 37:50.034
Or not.

37:51.113 --> 37:52.580
Okay.

38:02.191 --> 38:05.251
Okay, would you rather be A,
a friendless loser...

38:05.427 --> 38:08.260
...or B, a person with tons of friends
who secretly hate you?

38:08.430 --> 38:09.727
Oh, easy. B.

38:09.898 --> 38:10.922
Definitely B.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.863
B all the way.

38:14.636 --> 38:15.898
Claire, what do you think?

38:16.071 --> 38:17.971
Would you rather be a friendless loser...

38:18.140 --> 38:20.802
...or a person with tons of friends
who secretly hate you?

38:20.976 --> 38:22.534
Um...

38:22.711 --> 38:25.009
I guess I'd rather be the friendless loser.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.011
Congrats, you got your wish.

38:28.117 --> 38:29.914
- Harsh.
- I was kidding.

38:30.452 --> 38:32.579
Claire, ever play Truth or Dare?

38:32.754 --> 38:34.016
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

38:34.189 --> 38:36.783
- No, yeah, that would be...
- Remember that one time when we...?

38:36.959 --> 38:39.860
- Are you just gonna stand there all night?
- I have a good idea.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.791
- Okay.
- Right, that one, that one.

38:41.964 --> 38:43.591
Okay, someone ask me first.

38:43.765 --> 38:44.857
My house. Me first.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.364
Okay.

38:46.535 --> 38:47.729
Truth or dare?

38:47.903 --> 38:50.428
- Mm. Truth.
- Okay.

38:50.606 --> 38:51.868
Have you ever kissed a boy?

38:52.040 --> 38:54.600
No, you guys, that's stupid.
We already know the answer.

38:54.776 --> 38:59.213
No, but ask me after the auction
and the answer will be a definite yes.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.474
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

39:02.284 --> 39:04.548
Okay, Claire, truth or dare?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.415
- Dare.
- Who do you like?

39:09.558 --> 39:13.187
Um... I like a lot of people.
I like my parents, my friends...

39:13.362 --> 39:16.957
Not just like. "Like" like,
like more-than-a-friend like.

39:17.933 --> 39:19.264
I don't know.

39:19.434 --> 39:23.131
If you had to pick.
Someone here in Westchester.

39:24.573 --> 39:27.064
Well, I guess I don't really know anyone.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.611
Okay, there was
this skateboard guy, Chris.

39:35.784 --> 39:38.912
He's got this shaggy blond hair,
deep blue eyes, scar above his...

39:39.087 --> 39:40.281
You mean Chris Abeley?

39:40.656 --> 39:43.352
That's the guy Massie
was just talking about kissing.

39:43.525 --> 39:45.652
Wait, is he your boyfriend?

39:46.195 --> 39:47.526
Wow, Claire.

39:47.696 --> 39:50.790
You in accelerated math? You're good
at putting two and two together.

39:50.966 --> 39:55.232
Guys, stop talking about school.
It's really stressing me out.

39:55.404 --> 39:57.031
Can we just go to bed?

40:06.949 --> 40:09.247
Oh, my God. Claire, was that you?

40:09.418 --> 40:10.680
How embarrassing.

40:16.325 --> 40:20.022
Funny, Leesh, I thought it was the sound
of your boobs rubbing together.

40:20.195 --> 40:22.186
Snap.

40:23.465 --> 40:25.558
Let's just go to sleep.

40:46.755 --> 40:48.848
Claire, wait.

40:49.658 --> 40:51.023
You don't have to go.

40:51.193 --> 40:52.922
Have to?

40:53.095 --> 40:54.653
I want to.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.661
Fine. Whatever.

41:03.805 --> 41:07.036
Should we make our lip gloss
with lavender oil or peanut oil?

41:07.209 --> 41:08.437
Or this recipe has both.

41:08.610 --> 41:10.737
Not peanut. Massie's allergic.

41:10.912 --> 41:14.177
Please. Nothing touches these lips
but MAC and...

41:14.349 --> 41:15.873
- Chris Abeley.
- Exactly.

41:16.051 --> 41:17.882
No, I mean Chris Abeley, he's here.

41:18.053 --> 41:19.486
What?

41:22.924 --> 41:25.324
Hey, Claire.
- Hey, glad you could make it.

41:25.494 --> 41:26.791
Oh, Claire, meet my brother.

41:27.329 --> 41:28.956
Chris. We've met.

41:29.131 --> 41:31.463
We had a little run-in
on the first day of school.

41:32.934 --> 41:35.425
If you're looking for your girlfriend,
she's up there.

41:35.871 --> 41:37.896
My girlfriend lives across town.

41:38.407 --> 41:40.375
- But I thought your girlfriend was...
- Fawn.

41:40.542 --> 41:43.340
Yeah, she's perfect, she's beautiful...

41:43.512 --> 41:45.571
...and they've been together
since 7th grade.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.516
It's sickening.

41:49.117 --> 41:51.085
Chris, if you wanna go riding,
we gotta go.

41:51.253 --> 41:54.416
Oh, Chris, wait.
It's just something in your hair.

42:03.165 --> 42:04.564
There.

42:04.733 --> 42:06.200
Got it.

42:06.368 --> 42:10.828
Isaac!

42:15.610 --> 42:16.941
Hey.

42:17.612 --> 42:19.102
Hey.

42:19.481 --> 42:22.541
So how could you come to my house
and not bother to say hi?

42:22.718 --> 42:25.482
Sorry. My dad, he was in a hurry.

42:25.654 --> 42:28.817
How could you have not told me
Layne's your sister? I love Layne.

42:28.990 --> 42:31.686
- Really? Since when?
- Since always.

42:31.860 --> 42:35.591
- We should invite Layne riding sometime.
- Yeah, Layne doesn't really ride.

42:35.764 --> 42:37.994
I could teach her. I'm a great teacher.

42:38.166 --> 42:40.634
Patient and compassionate and...

42:40.802 --> 42:42.133
- And modest.
- Yeah, that too.

42:42.304 --> 42:43.771
We should all hang out sometime.

42:43.939 --> 42:45.406
What are you doing with my hat?

42:45.574 --> 42:47.701
I'm gonna donate it
at the auction on Saturday.

42:47.876 --> 42:49.707
- Better not.
- You'll just have to come.

42:49.878 --> 42:52.176
Actually,
the day of the auction's my birthday.

42:52.347 --> 42:55.111
Oh. What better place to celebrate?

43:15.137 --> 43:17.833
Layne, you're just the person
I wanted to see.

43:18.573 --> 43:20.336
- I am?
- Mm-hm.

43:20.509 --> 43:23.000
I have so much to tell you.

43:24.846 --> 43:27.679
Layne. Layne.

43:28.450 --> 43:29.917
Layne.

43:30.085 --> 43:33.179
I tried to MySpace you last night,
but it didn't go through.

43:33.355 --> 43:37.052
The thing is, I don't really have time
for friend requests right now...

43:37.225 --> 43:40.422
...because I'm really busy, you know,
babysitting my brother.

43:40.595 --> 43:42.153
But your brother's 15.

43:42.330 --> 43:43.820
Layne.

43:43.999 --> 43:47.435
Layne, are we still on
for manis and pedis after school?

43:47.602 --> 43:49.035
For suresies.

43:52.474 --> 43:54.942
Whoa. Wait a sec. You and Massie?

43:55.110 --> 43:57.101
Since when do you
wanna be friends with her?

43:57.279 --> 43:59.645
Everyone wants to be friends
with Massie.

43:59.815 --> 44:02.909
Isn't that why you lied to me
and ditched me for her sleepover?

44:04.386 --> 44:05.785
Yeah.

44:05.954 --> 44:07.546
That's what I thought.

44:07.889 --> 44:09.789
Hey, Mass, wait up.

44:09.958 --> 44:12.017
Hey, Massie, wait up. Massie.

44:12.194 --> 44:13.889
Layne, enough with the all caps.

44:14.062 --> 44:15.290
Stop yelling.

44:16.498 --> 44:18.398
I told you not to talk to me at school.

44:19.100 --> 44:22.900
- But I thought we were friends now.
- We are.

44:23.071 --> 44:24.868
Secret friends. Top-secret.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.268
Okay?

44:28.477 --> 44:30.502
Okay.

44:30.679 --> 44:32.271
Hi.

44:32.447 --> 44:34.176
Why were you talking to Layne Abeley?

44:34.349 --> 44:36.783
I was yelling at her for getting oatmeal
on my Fendi.

44:36.952 --> 44:37.976
Enough about Layne.

44:38.153 --> 44:40.781
I'm calling an emergency
Glambition meeting after school.

44:40.956 --> 44:44.153
The field trip is in six days
and we haven't made our lip gloss yet.

44:44.326 --> 44:46.590
I've actually got somewhere to be
after school.

44:46.761 --> 44:49.491
Does it involve
someone named Chris Babely?

44:49.664 --> 44:51.689
Oh, you could say that.

44:51.867 --> 44:52.891
Listen, tell you what.

44:53.068 --> 44:56.629
Meet at my house at 5, tell the girls.
What I have to do shouldn't take long.

44:56.805 --> 44:58.739
- Okay. Bye.
- All right, bye.

44:59.007 --> 45:00.599
Layne!

45:02.143 --> 45:05.135
Layne, come on,
your water's getting cold.

45:05.714 --> 45:07.511
Sorry, this is her first time.

45:08.250 --> 45:10.343
Do you have
any <i>US Weeklys</i> around here?

45:12.220 --> 45:13.881
Okay.

45:14.823 --> 45:16.848
FYI, you're only supposed to pick one.

45:17.792 --> 45:21.888
I think it'd be cool to have a different color
on each finger and toe, don't you?

45:22.063 --> 45:25.191
Ah! Okay, hot. It's hot.

45:25.367 --> 45:26.425
You'll get used to it.

45:26.601 --> 45:29.434
Just stick your feet in and relax...

45:29.604 --> 45:31.094
...quietly.

45:31.273 --> 45:35.801
Okay. All right. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

45:38.847 --> 45:41.975
So tell me about Chris.
Are you two close?

45:42.150 --> 45:44.846
Yeah, we're like besties.
We tell each other everything.

45:46.655 --> 45:49.146
- So has he mentioned me?
- No.

45:54.229 --> 45:55.992
That tickles.

46:10.478 --> 46:12.241
We're having a private meeting.

46:13.648 --> 46:14.842
If Mass ever shows.

46:18.687 --> 46:20.712
Claire, are you a bird?

46:20.889 --> 46:21.947
No.

46:22.123 --> 46:24.489
Then why is your suit so cheap?

46:24.659 --> 46:26.684
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

46:26.861 --> 46:30.262
Actually, Leesh,
it's an original Astrid from Brazil.

46:30.432 --> 46:32.195
I'm surprised you couldn't tell.

46:32.367 --> 46:33.527
I've heard of Astrid.

46:34.202 --> 46:36.727
I read a whole article about her
in <i>Teen Vogue.</i>

46:37.172 --> 46:38.264
You mean, him?

46:39.741 --> 46:41.641
Seriously, what is taking Massie so long?

46:41.810 --> 46:44.278
This project is worth
a bazillion percent of my grade.

46:44.446 --> 46:47.540
If I fail,
I'm stealing her tweezers for a month.

46:48.617 --> 46:51.279
Would it kill you to have a little fun
while you waited?

46:51.453 --> 46:54.047
With you? Probably.

47:00.895 --> 47:02.726
That was sweet.

47:04.532 --> 47:06.227
You guys should really come in.

47:08.436 --> 47:11.667
Why not?
It's not like we're doing anything.

47:39.501 --> 47:40.798
What's going on?

47:42.270 --> 47:43.965
I thought we were having a meeting.

47:44.139 --> 47:46.334
Well, we were,
but you were an hour late.

47:46.508 --> 47:49.238
I wasn't late, I was lost.

47:49.411 --> 47:51.276
Thank God
Chris Abeley was a Boy Scout...

47:51.446 --> 47:54.347
...or I swear I would've never made it
out of the woods.

47:54.516 --> 47:56.609
I seriously could've died out there.

47:56.785 --> 47:59.151
- Thank God you're safe.
- What if something happened?

47:59.320 --> 48:01.754
We would've never finished our project.

48:01.923 --> 48:03.515
Nice suit, Claire.

48:03.692 --> 48:05.182
It's an original Astrid.

48:05.360 --> 48:09.956
Unless Astrid means bargain-basement,
chain-store, low-rent knockoff...

48:10.432 --> 48:11.922
...I don't think so.

48:29.918 --> 48:31.852
Hey. What's up?

48:32.020 --> 48:33.578
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

48:33.755 --> 48:34.779
Claire, Claire.

48:36.758 --> 48:38.316
What's wrong? What happened?

48:38.827 --> 48:40.192
Nothing.

48:40.762 --> 48:42.286
Did something happen at the pool?

48:44.833 --> 48:46.027
Was it Massie?

48:47.969 --> 48:49.732
- What did she do?
- I told you, nothing.

48:49.904 --> 48:51.872
If it's nothing,
then why are you so upset?

48:54.109 --> 48:57.601
Either you tell me what's going on here
or I'm gonna go find out for myself.

48:57.779 --> 48:59.974
Mom, no, please. You can't do that.

49:00.148 --> 49:02.946
It was a stupid misunderstanding.
It was nothing.

49:03.118 --> 49:05.712
I'll talk to Massie about it.
It'll be cool, really.

49:05.887 --> 49:08.287
Why don't you go talk about it
right now?

49:08.723 --> 49:11.214
After dinner, once my homework's done.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.184
Fine, after dinner.

49:13.361 --> 49:15.886
Either you talk to Massie
or I'm gonna talk to her mom.

49:16.064 --> 49:17.497
Okay?

49:28.943 --> 49:30.433
Hi, Mrs. Block. Is Massie home?

49:30.879 --> 49:33.177
No, honey, she's not. Can I help you?

49:33.982 --> 49:36.416
I just needed to talk to her
about pre-algebra.

49:36.584 --> 49:39.451
She just took Bean for a walk.
You're welcome to wait for her.

49:39.621 --> 49:40.781
Okay.

51:16.985 --> 51:19.510
I didn't realize <i>Peter Pan</i>
was holding auditions today.

51:19.687 --> 51:21.587
I hope you get the part.

51:51.753 --> 51:54.347
Ew. What are you wearing?

51:54.522 --> 51:57.787
What are you wearing? I thought
we were going all <i>Teen Vogue-</i> ish today.

51:57.959 --> 52:00.257
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Leesh.

52:05.133 --> 52:06.828
Come on, Bean.

52:28.523 --> 52:30.184
Hey.

52:30.358 --> 52:31.382
- Todd.
- Don't mind me.

52:31.559 --> 52:32.583
What are you doing?

52:32.760 --> 52:34.785
What are you doing?

53:26.948 --> 53:30.782
Even Mary-Kate knew
when her boho look had run its course.

53:30.952 --> 53:32.544
Laundry day.

53:35.957 --> 53:37.788
Bean.

53:37.959 --> 53:42.293
Bean. Bean.

53:42.463 --> 53:44.294
Bean.

53:44.932 --> 53:47.196
Where are you, Bean?

53:47.368 --> 53:50.667
Shh. No barking and no pooping.

53:52.807 --> 53:54.536
I'll be back soon.

54:08.756 --> 54:10.383
Man, I can't believe this.

54:13.694 --> 54:15.161
Todd, stop doing that.

54:15.329 --> 54:18.025
She's got, like, a gazillion pictures.

54:18.199 --> 54:20.963
Don't you think she'd have one
without her annoying friends?

54:21.135 --> 54:25.196
Don't worry. If this works, Massie will be
without her annoying friends soon enough.

54:25.373 --> 54:28.638
- And put the pictures back.
- "Put the pictures back."

54:34.082 --> 54:36.277
<i>Kris, you still there?</i>

54:37.518 --> 54:38.576
<i>Always.</i>

54:38.753 --> 54:40.448
<i>Doing homework?</i>

54:41.355 --> 54:44.688
<i>Glambition.</i>
<i>I've just gotta get an A, Mass.</i>

54:44.859 --> 54:46.417
<i>What if you don't?</i>

54:47.095 --> 54:48.960
<i>You don't wanna know.</i>

54:49.130 --> 54:50.791
<i>Parents?</i>

54:50.965 --> 54:52.262
<i>Everything.</i>

54:52.433 --> 54:54.298
<i>What do you mean?</i>

54:54.869 --> 54:56.632
<i>Forget it.</i>

54:57.538 --> 54:59.472
<i>No, tell me.</i>

55:00.808 --> 55:02.935
<i>Secret for a secret?</i>

55:04.712 --> 55:06.236
<i>No.</i>

55:07.381 --> 55:08.814
<i>Come on.</i>

55:08.983 --> 55:12.009
<i>I have something</i>
<i>that I haven't told anyone.</i>

55:14.088 --> 55:16.454
<i>Okay, you first.</i>

55:17.058 --> 55:19.583
<i>Okay. You know how I've</i>
<i>been hanging with Chris Abeley?</i>

55:19.760 --> 55:23.389
<i>Well, I've been hanging with Layne too.</i>

55:23.564 --> 55:25.828
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

55:26.300 --> 55:28.928
<i>And I actually like her.</i>

55:29.871 --> 55:32.396
<i>Oh, my God times two.</i>

55:32.807 --> 55:34.832
<i>Okay, your turn.</i>

55:35.343 --> 55:38.278
<i>Okay, but you can't tell.</i>

55:38.446 --> 55:41.438
<i>You know how I'm always worried</i>
<i>about grades?</i>

55:41.616 --> 55:44.312
<i>It's not just because</i>
<i>I have strict parents.</i>

55:44.485 --> 55:47.045
<i>It's because I have poor parents.</i>

55:47.221 --> 55:49.849
<i>I'm on a scholarship at OCD.</i>

55:50.658 --> 55:53.354
<i>Oh, my God times three.</i>

55:53.528 --> 55:56.520
<i>But you live in the Montador building.</i>

55:58.099 --> 56:00.966
<i>No, we live in</i>
<i>the apartment building next door.</i>

56:01.135 --> 56:03.865
<i>You better not tell.</i>
<i>Not even for gossip points.</i>

56:04.038 --> 56:05.062
Bean.

56:05.239 --> 56:06.263
<i>Massie, promise.</i>

56:06.440 --> 56:07.839
Bean, are you in here?

56:08.009 --> 56:10.409
It's Massie. She's back, she's coming.

56:10.578 --> 56:12.808
Go, go under the bed. Go.

56:12.980 --> 56:15.005
Bean.

56:24.659 --> 56:27.389
<i>Seriously, you can't tell the other girls.</i>

56:27.562 --> 56:29.154
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

56:29.330 --> 56:30.991
<i>What I just told you.</i>

56:31.165 --> 56:32.393
<i>Huh?</i>

56:32.567 --> 56:33.898
<i>Nice. Forget it, Mass.</i>

56:42.243 --> 56:45.371
We have to do something.
We can't stay under here all night.

56:45.546 --> 56:48.743
- You have to go out there.
- No way.

56:48.916 --> 56:52.647
You can play the "creepy little brother
crushing on the hot neighbor" angle.

56:55.790 --> 56:58.350
Todd, I'm serious. Help.

56:58.526 --> 57:02.394
If I do this, you owe me bigtime.

57:12.039 --> 57:14.906
Oh, my God!
What are you doing in here?

57:15.076 --> 57:16.873
Wait, this isn't the guesthouse?

57:18.779 --> 57:21.043
Oh, my God. Mom.

57:21.215 --> 57:22.477
Mom.

57:23.317 --> 57:25.649
What is going on?

57:27.688 --> 57:28.814
Thank God.

57:28.990 --> 57:30.423
Thank me.

57:36.130 --> 57:37.154
What's that?

57:37.331 --> 57:39.458
A letter to the West Law
neighborhood security.

57:39.634 --> 57:43.502
I'm thinking of filing a restraining order
against that prepubescent monkey boy.

57:43.671 --> 57:45.866
Why don't you talk
to your new BFF about it?

57:46.040 --> 57:48.008
After all, the monkey freak's her brother.

57:48.175 --> 57:50.166
Claire's not my BFF.

57:50.344 --> 57:52.539
Kristen asked her
to sign up for squash with us.

57:52.713 --> 57:56.672
She gave me her extra racket.
What was I supposed to do, ignore her?

57:57.084 --> 57:58.949
Yeah. That's what we always do.

57:59.120 --> 58:01.816
And since when can't you afford
your own racket?

58:01.989 --> 58:03.718
Nice, Mass, that's real nice. Thanks.

58:03.891 --> 58:04.915
Thanks a lot.

58:05.092 --> 58:06.616
What?

58:07.094 --> 58:10.063
Remind me
not to go on the scale anymore.

58:10.231 --> 58:13.428
If you're gonna weigh yourself,
take off that tent you call a skirt.

58:13.601 --> 58:14.932
It must weigh 15 pounds.

58:15.102 --> 58:17.798
Which is nothing compared
to my thunder thighs, right?

58:17.972 --> 58:19.234
What is everyone's problem?

58:19.407 --> 58:21.739
Who are you
and what have you done with my friends?

58:21.909 --> 58:24.901
By friends, do you mean us or Layne?

58:25.846 --> 58:27.814
I'm not friends with Layne Abeley.

58:27.982 --> 58:29.244
Hey, guys, what's going on?

58:29.417 --> 58:32.215
What's going on is a spot in our foursome
just opened up.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.883
- Wanna join us, Claire?
- But I thought you already had four.

58:36.824 --> 58:37.882
Not anymore.

58:42.096 --> 58:43.222
Whoa, you...

58:43.397 --> 58:47.561
Wait a sec.
You guys are choosing Claire over me?

58:49.203 --> 58:50.864
Well?

58:56.477 --> 58:57.944
I'm in.

59:01.515 --> 59:02.948
Oh, my God. Did you see?

59:03.117 --> 59:05.244
I know. It was just...
- Yeah.

59:05.419 --> 59:07.751
She's such a loser now.

59:07.922 --> 59:10.413
Thank you.
- I know.

59:10.591 --> 59:11.717
She really deserves it.

59:11.892 --> 59:12.950
I'm not fat, am I?

59:21.369 --> 59:23.599
Oh, my God, wait. Oh, my God.

59:24.472 --> 59:25.803
Hey, Mass.

59:26.140 --> 59:28.836
There's an empty seat here
if you wanna sit with us, you know?

59:29.009 --> 59:31.534
Um... No, that's okay.

59:31.712 --> 59:34.476
- Have you seen Jenna or Tricia?
- I said that you could sit...

59:34.648 --> 59:37.549
The only place I wanna sit
is with my friends.

59:37.718 --> 59:40.983
I wouldn't be caught dead sitting with you.
I don't even like you.

59:42.256 --> 59:43.780
God, you really are a bitch.

59:43.958 --> 59:46.688
Sorry, <i>no comprende.</i> I don't speak loser.

59:47.595 --> 59:48.960
<i>No hablas</i> bitch.

59:49.597 --> 59:51.565
Mass, there's a free seat right here.

59:58.406 --> 01:00:00.306
Love the look.

01:00:13.687 --> 01:00:15.450
Where is everyone?

01:00:15.623 --> 01:00:18.456
They're in detention. Let's just go.

01:00:22.229 --> 01:00:24.026
Oh, wait. There they are.

01:00:24.198 --> 01:00:25.756
I'm so excited.

01:00:25.933 --> 01:00:28.163
We have to go shopping there.

01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:30.400
Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:30.571 --> 01:00:33.301
That's gonna be so much fun.

01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:35.498
Yeah.

01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:37.337
Can we just go?

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.488
Okay. We need a dressing room.

01:00:48.656 --> 01:00:51.921
You said you already had
a totally slutty dress to wear to the auction.

01:00:52.092 --> 01:00:54.026
I do. These are for you.

01:00:55.796 --> 01:00:57.559
I can't.

01:00:58.032 --> 01:01:00.364
I spent all my allowance
on that new Chloé handbag.

01:01:00.534 --> 01:01:03.094
The one Lindsay Lohan
was carrying in that accident.

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.794
So I'll pay.

01:01:05.673 --> 01:01:06.833
You'd buy me a dress?

01:01:07.007 --> 01:01:09.066
Actually,
one of my three best friends will.

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:11.400
Dylan, Kristen or Massie?

01:01:11.579 --> 01:01:13.740
No, try Visa, MasterCard or Amex.

01:01:13.914 --> 01:01:17.042
Oh, and this is for you.

01:01:17.218 --> 01:01:18.708
- Your cell?
- I upgraded.

01:01:18.886 --> 01:01:20.945
- iPhone.
- I can't take your cell phone.

01:01:21.121 --> 01:01:22.520
Why? I'm not using it.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.352
I've erased all my info,
so you can totally make it yours.

01:01:25.526 --> 01:01:27.790
We can't hang with you
if we can't reach you.

01:01:27.962 --> 01:01:29.930
When we're done,
let's go back to my house.

01:01:30.097 --> 01:01:32.588
- I don't know. I have to be home by 5.
- Make it 7.

01:01:32.766 --> 01:01:34.666
Trust me. It'll be worth it.

01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:45.902
- Okay. Oh, my God.
- Okay, wait.

01:01:47.281 --> 01:01:49.146
Just shake it off. We shake it off.

01:02:03.197 --> 01:02:04.858
Oh, my God.

01:02:05.032 --> 01:02:07.466
- Here.
- Put it on.

01:02:10.571 --> 01:02:12.505
- You look good.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:12.673 --> 01:02:14.436
It's cute.

01:02:16.443 --> 01:02:17.671
I think it's pretty.

01:02:21.348 --> 01:02:22.975
- I love it.
- That's the one.

01:02:24.985 --> 01:02:27.112
Oh, my God.

01:02:29.924 --> 01:02:31.619
Okay.

01:02:48.542 --> 01:02:51.534
Thanks, Leesh. Today was seriously,
like, the greatest day ever.

01:02:51.712 --> 01:02:53.043
Where have you been?

01:02:53.213 --> 01:02:54.544
We have been worried sick.

01:02:54.715 --> 01:02:56.580
I called Layne, Massie.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.911
I sent your father out
to look for you.

01:02:59.386 --> 01:03:01.047
You called Massie? What did she say?

01:03:01.221 --> 01:03:04.315
She said you were probably out
with Dylan, Alicia and Kristen.

01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:06.322
- Claire.
- What?

01:03:06.493 --> 01:03:07.983
We were shopping. Big deal.

01:03:08.162 --> 01:03:11.393
It's a big deal
when you are over two hours late.

01:03:11.565 --> 01:03:13.430
I needed a dress for the auction.

01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:15.068
Oh, what, from BCBG?

01:03:15.235 --> 01:03:16.566
We can't afford that.

01:03:16.737 --> 01:03:18.432
It's fine, Mom. Alicia paid.

01:03:18.606 --> 01:03:20.904
- No, Claire, that is not fine.
- Then what is?

01:03:21.075 --> 01:03:23.873
For me to wear overalls
or some lame bathing suit?

01:03:24.044 --> 01:03:27.104
We're not in Florida anymore, Mom.
The Gap doesn't cut it here.

01:03:27.281 --> 01:03:30.375
- Neither does your attitude.
- Well, sue me for trying to fit in.

01:03:31.385 --> 01:03:34.047
You're not hanging out
with those girls anymore.

01:03:34.221 --> 01:03:35.415
Mom, you can't do that.

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:36.613
Oh, yes, I can.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:40.021
If you continue with this attitude,
you will not be needing a dress...

01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:43.095
...to go to that auction,
because you will not be going.

01:04:58.972 --> 01:05:00.599
Yes.

01:05:06.914 --> 01:05:08.609
So it's all in there.

01:05:08.782 --> 01:05:10.511
There's also four different flavors.

01:05:10.684 --> 01:05:13.118
Alicia, Kristen, Dylan and Massie.

01:05:13.287 --> 01:05:16.017
But you can get rid of the Massie
if you want.

01:05:17.357 --> 01:05:20.417
Are you seriously trying
to make me feel bad for you or something?

01:05:20.594 --> 01:05:21.788
You should feel bad.

01:05:21.962 --> 01:05:25.659
You guys ditched me for no reason,
and worse, for Claire.

01:05:25.833 --> 01:05:31.100
That's like turning down, I don't know,
Justin Timberlake for K-Fed.

01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:32.499
It's just wrong.

01:05:32.673 --> 01:05:35.369
You're the one who decided
to become buddy-buddy with her.

01:05:35.542 --> 01:05:36.566
Since when?

01:05:36.744 --> 01:05:39.144
Since you started hanging out
and watching her DVDs.

01:05:39.313 --> 01:05:41.975
The only thing I've watched
are her chronic bad hair days.

01:05:42.149 --> 01:05:44.481
You told Alicia
right after you called Dylan fat.

01:05:44.952 --> 01:05:46.385
I never called Dylan fat.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.911
Yes, you did, two nights ago.

01:05:49.089 --> 01:05:51.023
No, I didn't, at least not to her face.

01:05:51.191 --> 01:05:52.658
Look, I'll prove it. See?

01:05:52.826 --> 01:05:54.885
She called me right after, 10:01.

01:05:55.062 --> 01:05:57.496
Two nights ago at 10:01,
I was out looking for Bean.

01:05:57.664 --> 01:05:59.393
I missed the beginning of <i>The Hills.</i>

01:05:59.566 --> 01:06:02.262
But that doesn't make any sense.
Dylan said you IM'd her.

01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:05.872
- Well, I didn't.
- Like you don't remember what I told you.

01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:09.202
- What you told me when?
- The night after, when we were IM'ing.

01:06:09.376 --> 01:06:11.105
When you were mad at me
for no reason?

01:06:11.278 --> 01:06:13.178
Which, by the way, was totally selfish...

01:06:13.347 --> 01:06:16.111
...considering I waited an hour
for Chris Abeley to show.

01:06:16.283 --> 01:06:19.275
- When were you waiting for Chris Abeley?
- Like, until 10:00.

01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:22.945
- We were IM'ing before that.
- No, I wasn't!

01:06:28.228 --> 01:06:30.025
But maybe someone else was.

01:06:35.769 --> 01:06:37.862
Claire, it's for you.

01:06:39.339 --> 01:06:42.638
- Hello?
- Hey, Claire, it's Kris.

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.607
Hey. Hold on a sec.

01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:48.214
Todd, hang up the phone.
I can hear you breathing.

01:06:48.982 --> 01:06:51.280
Actually, it's not Todd, it's me.

01:06:51.451 --> 01:06:53.043
- Dylan?
- And me.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:56.087
Oh, hey, Leesh.
Wow, I've never been on a four-way before.

01:06:56.256 --> 01:06:59.089
- Fun.
- <i>Actually, it's a five-way.</i>

01:06:59.259 --> 01:07:02.820
Fun's over.
We know what you did, Claire.

01:07:02.996 --> 01:07:05.226
Hijacking my IM, so not cool.

01:07:05.799 --> 01:07:09.326
So here's a little message for you.

01:07:30.157 --> 01:07:33.456
Leesh. My mom will freak
if she sees your feet on the counter.

01:07:34.862 --> 01:07:38.389
Okay, here.

01:07:39.099 --> 01:07:40.896
I'm excited. They're so cute.

01:07:41.068 --> 01:07:42.558
Oh, my God.

01:07:42.736 --> 01:07:45.671
Okay, ready? One, two, three, go.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.264
Okay.

01:07:48.809 --> 01:07:50.140
- Oh, my God.
- What is this?

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.504
Oh, my God. Adorable.

01:07:51.678 --> 01:07:53.805
I figured they're so much cuter
than lab coats.

01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:55.005
Agreed.

01:07:55.182 --> 01:07:56.809
Oh, look, it says Glambition.

01:07:56.984 --> 01:07:59.179
- I heart this.
- It says our names. Awesome.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.188
Okay, girls.
Where's the bottles, the recipes?

01:08:02.956 --> 01:08:05.516
Okay. Recipe number one.

01:08:05.692 --> 01:08:09.219
Two tablespoons of honey,
three to four drops of peanut oil...

01:08:09.396 --> 01:08:10.590
...four ounces of vanilla.

01:08:10.764 --> 01:08:13.358
- I need an honest opinion.
- Your butt doesn't look big.

01:08:13.533 --> 01:08:14.693
Please, I know.

01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.399
The day of the auction
is Chris Abeley's birthday.

01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:20.870
As his practically girlfriend,
I need to do something really memorable.

01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:23.134
I am now opening the floor
to suggestions.

01:08:24.144 --> 01:08:27.078
- Oh, I know. You should bake him a cake.
- What?

01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:30.978
My mom always says the best way
to a boy's heart is through his stomach.

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:33.783
No, no.
How about you be in a cake and jump out?

01:08:33.953 --> 01:08:35.921
- And jump out. Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.

01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:38.488
- Please, that's ridiculous.
- More than ridiculous.

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:39.683
Ridunkulous.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:43.488
Yeah, but it would be kind of cool
to wear a cute little outfit or something.

01:08:43.663 --> 01:08:45.756
You know, when you jump out.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.591
You know what?
I'm gonna do that and something better.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.402
God, I'm a genius.

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:57.099
Do you have a problem, Stare?

01:08:57.277 --> 01:08:59.541
No, my mom wanted to borrow an egg.

01:08:59.712 --> 01:09:02.648
An egg? Sure.

01:09:03.517 --> 01:09:05.006
Here you go.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.613
Catch.

01:09:21.335 --> 01:09:24.167
I am so back.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.602
Hey, what happened?

01:09:27.774 --> 01:09:30.004
Claire, wait a minute.

01:09:31.645 --> 01:09:32.669
Claire, what's wrong?

01:09:32.845 --> 01:09:34.211
Leave me alone.

01:09:34.381 --> 01:09:37.179
No, Claire. I let it go last time.

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:38.841
Tell me what's wrong.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.544
Everything.

01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:45.214
This school, this house,
my clothes, Massie, everything.

01:09:47.094 --> 01:09:49.028
She hates me, Mom. She hates me.

01:09:49.196 --> 01:09:52.131
She's been making my life miserable
since the day we came.

01:09:52.299 --> 01:09:55.564
At first, you know,
I just wanted her to like me.

01:09:55.736 --> 01:09:58.671
But then I was just hoping
that she'd stop picking on me.

01:09:58.839 --> 01:09:59.931
I tried everything.

01:10:00.107 --> 01:10:02.974
And I did some things
I shouldn't have done.

01:10:03.844 --> 01:10:06.472
I thought it was the only way.

01:10:06.646 --> 01:10:09.342
I thought it was the only way to...

01:10:09.516 --> 01:10:11.541
To what?

01:10:12.486 --> 01:10:16.115
Oh, Claire, listen to me.
You can't make someone like you.

01:10:16.857 --> 01:10:19.121
You're not in charge
of other people's feelings...

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:21.157
...or their actions, just yours.

01:10:22.262 --> 01:10:25.891
Maybe some of your actions
weren't so great either.

01:10:28.869 --> 01:10:30.359
You wanna tell me what you did?

01:10:30.537 --> 01:10:34.098
I can't. You wouldn't understand.

01:10:35.142 --> 01:10:37.042
Right, because I was never 12.

01:10:39.613 --> 01:10:40.637
Oh, honey.

01:10:40.814 --> 01:10:44.045
Whatever you did,
you have to make it right.

01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:47.778
But whatever it is, I guarantee you,
it's not as bad as you think.

01:10:48.321 --> 01:10:49.515
It's worse.

01:10:50.524 --> 01:10:54.290
Be yourself, Claire,
not who people want you to be.

01:11:06.206 --> 01:11:07.298
Can I sit here?

01:11:16.349 --> 01:11:20.046
Listen, Layne, I'm sorry for everything.

01:11:20.854 --> 01:11:23.618
For ditching you for the sleepover.

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:26.850
For pretending to be friends with Massie.

01:11:28.829 --> 01:11:33.562
I don't know how to explain it,
it's just I wanted to be a part of them.

01:11:33.733 --> 01:11:36.566
To be a part of that group.

01:11:37.404 --> 01:11:42.467
And the more they excluded me,
the more important it became.

01:11:44.111 --> 01:11:46.545
The way people treat them...

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.016
...the way that they can have anything
they want whenever they want...

01:11:52.018 --> 01:11:55.385
...well, I guess I just wanted that too.

01:11:58.558 --> 01:12:01.493
I have no idea
what makes them so special.

01:12:01.661 --> 01:12:03.822
They just are.

01:12:04.598 --> 01:12:06.589
It's because they believe that they are.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.434
So other people do too.

01:12:10.303 --> 01:12:14.831
Even me sometimes.

01:12:17.344 --> 01:12:19.505
Can I please have your attention?

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:22.705
Excuse me.

01:12:24.317 --> 01:12:25.477
Thank you.

01:12:25.652 --> 01:12:29.588
Now, who's ready
for a revolutionary line of cosmetics?

01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:33.622
Something that tastes
as good as it looks.

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:39.758
I present to you Glambition.

01:12:39.933 --> 01:12:43.300
And now, our esteemed
and ridiculously hot president...

01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:44.630
...Kristen Gregory.

01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:50.908
"Glambition is a new line
of beauty products...

01:12:51.077 --> 01:12:53.307
...made entirely
of all-natural ingredients.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.947
Over the next few weeks...

01:12:55.115 --> 01:12:57.413
...we will introduce to you
our entire line...

01:12:57.584 --> 01:12:58.915
...of body scrubs...

01:12:59.085 --> 01:13:01.178
...creams, glitters and cheek tints.

01:13:01.655 --> 01:13:03.919
Today, for the very low price...

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:07.491
...of one for $6 and two for $ 10...

01:13:07.661 --> 01:13:09.754
...we are launching
our flavored lip gloss...

01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:12.490
...which comes in four flavors:
mint, cherry...

01:13:12.666 --> 01:13:14.190
...vanilla and raspberry.

01:13:14.367 --> 01:13:18.599
Also known as Dylan, Alicia, Kristen...

01:13:18.772 --> 01:13:20.501
...and Massie."

01:13:20.674 --> 01:13:24.701
And you better hurry,
we expect the Massies to sell out real fast.

01:13:25.779 --> 01:13:29.146
Oh, sorry, Layne,
we don't sell oatmeal flavor.

01:13:31.651 --> 01:13:34.347
I wish she'd swallow her tongue.

01:13:45.665 --> 01:13:46.689
It stings.

01:13:46.866 --> 01:13:48.493
My lips.

01:13:50.303 --> 01:13:51.736
Oh, my God.

01:13:55.442 --> 01:13:56.670
My lips are burning!

01:13:56.843 --> 01:13:57.867
Mine too.

01:13:58.044 --> 01:13:59.739
My lips are on fire.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.612
It looks like Jenna's lips got a boob job.

01:14:02.782 --> 01:14:04.147
This is not funny.

01:14:04.317 --> 01:14:05.579
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.

01:14:05.752 --> 01:14:08.084
What's the problem?
- Oh, my God, I need water.

01:14:08.255 --> 01:14:09.984
Okay, girls, please settle down.
We need to...

01:14:12.559 --> 01:14:14.026
I want my money back.

01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:15.218
Oh, my God.

01:14:15.395 --> 01:14:17.226
My dad's gonna sue you.

01:14:17.397 --> 01:14:18.455
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:14:18.632 --> 01:14:20.031
I'm gonna fail. Do something.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.499
Okay, okay.
Is anyone here allergic to peanuts?

01:14:26.673 --> 01:14:27.935
Me, I am.

01:14:29.376 --> 01:14:32.812
They made their makeup with peanuts?
That's the most common allergy ever.

01:14:32.979 --> 01:14:36.039
Everyone says they're popular,
no one says they're geniuses.

01:14:46.893 --> 01:14:48.656
Layne, your oatmeal. I need it.

01:14:48.828 --> 01:14:49.852
Okay.

01:14:50.497 --> 01:14:52.294
Everybody, listen up.

01:14:52.832 --> 01:14:54.129
I have oatmeal.

01:14:54.301 --> 01:14:55.962
We don't need oatmeal. We need help.

01:14:56.136 --> 01:14:57.194
Yeah, help us.

01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.201
Since when do you help the
Pretty Committee?

01:14:59.372 --> 01:15:02.569
Since everyone's lips are inflating
to the size of Jessica Simpson's.

01:15:02.742 --> 01:15:04.209
This will help.

01:15:04.377 --> 01:15:06.038
Here you go.

01:15:08.315 --> 01:15:10.374
Take it. I know it's gross, take it.

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.887
Thank God.

01:15:15.288 --> 01:15:18.086
Thank you so much, Claire.
I don't know what I would've done.

01:15:18.258 --> 01:15:20.488
My lips are my best feature.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.423
Claire, hey.

01:15:24.064 --> 01:15:26.760
I just wanted to say thanks
for saving the day.

01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:28.929
Yeah, who would've thought?

01:15:29.102 --> 01:15:32.265
Zero to hero,
even if it was just for a few minutes.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.964
Looks like you made some friends.

01:15:35.542 --> 01:15:37.806
Look, you don't have to be nice
to me now.

01:15:37.977 --> 01:15:40.445
I wasn't going to, it's just...

01:15:40.613 --> 01:15:42.080
I'm glad I told you my secret...

01:15:42.248 --> 01:15:44.182
...instead of Massie.

01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:46.876
Kris, could use your help back here.

01:15:47.053 --> 01:15:49.112
After all, you are Glambition's president.

01:15:49.289 --> 01:15:50.950
This was all your idea.

01:15:52.192 --> 01:15:53.659
I guess I'll see you around.

01:15:53.827 --> 01:15:55.260
Yeah. See you.

01:15:59.065 --> 01:16:02.034
So I'm thinking...

01:16:02.202 --> 01:16:06.036
...oatmeal flavor might be a bestseller.

01:16:12.779 --> 01:16:14.644
Yes. Oh, hey, how are you?

01:16:14.814 --> 01:16:18.250
It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.

01:16:18.418 --> 01:16:20.750
I'm so sorry.

01:16:21.654 --> 01:16:23.849
Oh, beautiful. Great to see you.

01:16:24.023 --> 01:16:25.388
How are you?

01:16:25.558 --> 01:16:28.049
Good to see you. All right, have fun.

01:16:30.663 --> 01:16:33.325
Very good. Very good.

01:16:36.603 --> 01:16:38.093
Layne.

01:16:38.938 --> 01:16:41.930
- Wow, you look awesome.
- Oh.

01:16:42.475 --> 01:16:44.875
Does everyone party like this
in Westchester?

01:16:45.044 --> 01:16:48.411
Well, no one throws a party
like the Blocks.

01:16:49.015 --> 01:16:50.039
Oh, hey.

01:16:50.216 --> 01:16:51.376
Hey.

01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:52.813
Hey, happy birthday.

01:16:52.986 --> 01:16:55.216
Thanks.
Claire, this is my girlfriend, Fawn.

01:16:55.388 --> 01:16:57.015
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.418
- Hey, Fawn.
- Hi.

01:16:58.591 --> 01:17:01.719
- All right, we'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

01:17:03.163 --> 01:17:04.357
Wow.

01:17:04.531 --> 01:17:06.294
Not even Massie could compete with her.

01:17:06.466 --> 01:17:07.956
She's beautiful.

01:17:08.134 --> 01:17:09.601
Yeah.

01:17:09.769 --> 01:17:12.670
Speaking of Massie...

01:17:13.306 --> 01:17:15.240
It looks so awesome.

01:17:18.011 --> 01:17:19.273
Ta-da!

01:17:19.446 --> 01:17:21.346
Oh, my God. Where'd you get that?

01:17:21.514 --> 01:17:22.845
- That's so cute.
- Really cute.

01:17:23.016 --> 01:17:24.210
You look amazing.

01:17:24.384 --> 01:17:26.750
Yeah, Chris Babely
is seriously gonna freak.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.889
A hundred dollars says tonight
you're getting your first kiss.

01:17:30.056 --> 01:17:31.887
And maybe my second and third too.

01:17:32.959 --> 01:17:34.221
Oh, my God. That's too cute.

01:17:34.394 --> 01:17:35.827
That's adorable. Oh, my God.

01:17:35.995 --> 01:17:39.089
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:17:39.265 --> 01:17:44.066
And sold for $ 15,000. Thank you.

01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:49.273
I wish we could bid on something.

01:17:49.843 --> 01:17:53.108
Think there will be anything
that goes for under 20 bucks?

01:17:54.247 --> 01:17:55.475
Oh, hey.

01:17:55.648 --> 01:17:57.775
We'll start the bidding at $ 12,000.

01:17:57.951 --> 01:17:59.816
Still no Massie.

01:17:59.986 --> 01:18:03.149
Maybe the wicked witch of Westchester
is dead.

01:18:03.556 --> 01:18:05.456
I'll be right back.

01:18:06.092 --> 01:18:07.923
Alicia, these are yours.

01:18:08.094 --> 01:18:09.118
The dresses.

01:18:09.295 --> 01:18:11.263
My parents thought
I should give them back.

01:18:11.431 --> 01:18:13.626
And your cell phone's in there too.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.564
By the way,
nice job trying to oust Massie.

01:18:16.736 --> 01:18:18.328
You got closer than I ever did.

01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:23.533
Sold for $ 17,500 to the lucky lady.

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:24.904
- Thank you.
- Hey, Dylan.

01:18:25.645 --> 01:18:28.205
For what it's worth,
you would've rocked that miniskirt.

01:18:28.381 --> 01:18:30.110
Before we wrap up our auction...

01:18:30.283 --> 01:18:31.716
Thanks.

01:18:32.285 --> 01:18:33.980
Please save some room for dessert...

01:18:34.153 --> 01:18:35.518
Where's Massie?

01:18:35.688 --> 01:18:37.849
- because we have
a very special birthday presentation.

01:18:38.024 --> 01:18:39.958
Chris Abeley, this one's for you.

01:18:56.509 --> 01:18:58.704
I think it'd be nice if someone...
- What the...?

01:18:58.878 --> 01:19:02.314
...said a few words about Chris.
- Claire Lyons, I'm gonna kill you!

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:06.314
I think I'd like Fawn, Chris's girlfriend...

01:19:06.486 --> 01:19:07.646
...to please come up.

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.845
Chris's girlfriend, Fawn, come up here.

01:19:12.725 --> 01:19:15.558
Fawn? Girlfriend?

01:19:18.298 --> 01:19:19.492
Um...

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:22.066
I really don't know what to say.

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:25.295
Chris and I met back in the seventh grade,
you know.

01:19:25.471 --> 01:19:28.929
- I wasn't really that interested...
- Massie, it's safe to come out now.

01:19:29.475 --> 01:19:32.000
I was like, whoa.

01:19:32.178 --> 01:19:33.304
He has a girlfriend?

01:19:33.479 --> 01:19:36.209
When he didn't hit me in the face
with a dodge ball...

01:19:36.382 --> 01:19:37.679
...I knew he was the one.

01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:39.374
Happy birthday, babe.

01:19:39.552 --> 01:19:41.577
I love you.

01:19:44.290 --> 01:19:46.383
I think I'm gonna barf.

01:19:53.433 --> 01:19:57.096
Is it possible to actually die
of embarrassment?

01:19:57.604 --> 01:20:00.630
If it were, I'd be dead a long time ago.

01:20:05.878 --> 01:20:08.574
They fall off all the time, the charms.

01:20:08.748 --> 01:20:10.443
Mm-hm.

01:20:10.617 --> 01:20:12.278
Um...

01:20:12.452 --> 01:20:15.387
Thanks, you know,
for helping me back there.

01:20:15.555 --> 01:20:17.216
You didn't have to do that.

01:20:18.424 --> 01:20:19.857
I know.

01:20:20.793 --> 01:20:23.125
Then why did you?

01:20:23.496 --> 01:20:25.054
Because I'm not you.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.768
That was you, right,
who sent the oatmeal text?

01:20:29.936 --> 01:20:31.426
Yeah.

01:20:31.604 --> 01:20:32.696
Why?

01:20:32.872 --> 01:20:35.238
You could've been the hero.
Why'd you let me?

01:20:35.975 --> 01:20:38.000
I don't know. I wanted to.

01:20:38.177 --> 01:20:42.045
Come on, what about all the other times
you've tried to make my life miserable?

01:20:42.215 --> 01:20:43.409
You don't get it, Claire.

01:20:43.583 --> 01:20:45.312
You're right, I don't.

01:20:45.485 --> 01:20:48.716
Look how quickly my friends
were willing to ditch me for you.

01:20:48.888 --> 01:20:51.584
Yeah, so, what,
you have to be mean to me?

01:20:52.592 --> 01:20:56.653
I mean, come on.
You're, like, a major threat.

01:20:59.432 --> 01:21:03.926
Me? To who, you?

01:21:04.103 --> 01:21:06.333
Are you kidding me?

01:21:07.106 --> 01:21:09.597
Hey, the singing stopped.

01:21:11.177 --> 01:21:13.270
Well, I better go find the girls.

01:21:13.446 --> 01:21:15.710
It's not really a party without me.

01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:19.409
This is going to sound totally weird,
but can I take your picture?

01:21:19.585 --> 01:21:21.143
It's for my brother.

01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:24.485
How can you two be related?
He's such a little creep.

01:21:24.657 --> 01:21:26.022
I know.

01:21:35.334 --> 01:21:36.858
Here.

01:21:37.036 --> 01:21:39.436
And for the record, I'd pick A too.

01:21:40.173 --> 01:21:41.197
What's A-2?

01:21:42.208 --> 01:21:43.835
I'd rather be a friendless loser...

01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:46.604
...than have a bunch of friends
who secretly hate me.

01:22:40.099 --> 01:22:41.327
Did you have fun tonight?

01:22:41.934 --> 01:22:43.231
Actually, I did.

01:22:44.203 --> 01:22:45.761
Who gave you the flower?

01:22:45.938 --> 01:22:47.735
Believe it or not, Massie did.

01:22:48.808 --> 01:22:51.436
Not sure how long it'll last,
but I'm hoping for a while.

01:22:52.145 --> 01:22:54.739
Are you talking about the flower
or Massie?

01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:57.109
Both.

01:27:15.207 --> 01:27:17.198
