We're on the set of Lisa Ann's

01:20.623 --> 01:24.877
"Big Titted Cougars."

01:24.919 --> 01:28.881
Whew. Shocker that I would

01:24.919 --> 01:28.881
be in a cougar movie.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.425
[Man]

01:28.923 --> 01:31.425
What's the difference with

01:28.923 --> 01:31.425
a cougar and a MILF?

01:31.467 --> 01:34.345
My take is,

01:31.467 --> 01:34.345
a cougar and a MILF:

01:34.386 --> 01:37.181
MILF is supposed to be

01:34.386 --> 01:37.181
a "mom that I'd like to fuck."

01:37.222 --> 01:39.183
So I think that would

01:37.222 --> 01:39.183
make you a mom, right?

01:39.224 --> 01:42.311
I think a cougar is

01:39.224 --> 01:42.311
the same older seductress,

01:42.353 --> 01:43.771
but with no kids.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.397
So I'm glad to say

01:43.813 --> 01:45.397
I'm a cougar,

01:45.439 --> 01:48.860
or I'm a MILF with no kids,

01:45.439 --> 01:48.860
whatever you prefer.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.111
[Lisa Ann]

01:48.901 --> 01:51.111
I feel like if you can't

01:48.901 --> 01:51.111
succeed in porn,

01:51.153 --> 01:53.739
you kind of can't

01:51.153 --> 01:53.739
succeed anywhere.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.783
'Cause it's really

01:53.781 --> 01:55.783
not that difficult.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.703
It's a skill we all have.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.703
You're fucking for a living.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.287
People are like,

01:58.744 --> 02:00.287
"How are you the best?"

02:00.329 --> 02:04.124
Like, um, "I showed up

02:00.329 --> 02:04.124
on time every time."

02:04.166 --> 02:06.836
It's pretty hard

02:04.166 --> 02:06.836
to fail out of porn,

02:06.878 --> 02:09.463
but it seems like

02:06.878 --> 02:09.463
everybody does it.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.757
My last goal

02:09.505 --> 02:11.757
in my retirement letter

02:11.799 --> 02:12.967
was to write this book,

02:13.009 --> 02:14.969
and it'll be

02:13.009 --> 02:14.969
one year on Tuesday.

02:15.011 --> 02:17.304
So I did reach

02:15.011 --> 02:17.304
all of my goals.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.514
This is it.

02:18.556 --> 02:21.266
This is so exciting.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.896
Whoa. Okay.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.397
I don't want to hurt anything.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.816
I'm gonna open it

02:26.438 --> 02:28.816
very carefully.

02:28.858 --> 02:32.820
Now, everyone, this is

02:28.858 --> 02:32.820
so fucking dope.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.488
[gasps]

02:34.530 --> 02:36.115
Oh, look.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.744
Oh!

02:42.413 --> 02:44.456
My first two years

02:42.413 --> 02:44.456
I was under contract

02:44.498 --> 02:46.542
with a company called

02:44.498 --> 02:46.542
Metro Home Video.

02:46.584 --> 02:49.253
And being under contract

02:46.584 --> 02:49.253
was an ideal situation for me

02:49.294 --> 02:50.671
because I wanted

02:49.294 --> 02:50.671
to feature dance.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.924
Back then, when you were

02:50.713 --> 02:52.924
the contract star,

02:52.965 --> 02:55.927
they made these glamorous

02:52.965 --> 02:55.927
posters and fliers for you,

02:55.968 --> 02:57.720
and they gave you

02:55.968 --> 02:57.720
as many as you wanted

02:57.762 --> 03:00.098
to go out on the road

02:57.762 --> 03:00.098
and use as marketing materials.

03:00.139 --> 03:02.182
You know, in the '90's

03:00.139 --> 03:02.182
when I started shooting,

03:02.224 --> 03:05.352
I was unaware

03:02.224 --> 03:05.352
that all of the movies

03:02.224 --> 03:05.352
a contract girl shoots

03:05.394 --> 03:07.479
are sold to cable,

03:05.394 --> 03:07.479
and cable was still

03:07.521 --> 03:09.565
a very big place where

03:07.521 --> 03:09.565
these companies made money.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.400
Cable didn't buy interracial.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.987
So I was unable

03:11.442 --> 03:14.987
to do interracial

03:11.442 --> 03:14.987
when I was under contract.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.530
People were telling me

03:15.029 --> 03:16.530
all day long, like,

03:16.572 --> 03:19.033
"If you do interracial,

03:16.572 --> 03:19.033
it's going to ruin your career.

03:19.075 --> 03:20.952
"No one's going to hire you

03:19.075 --> 03:20.952
as a feature dancer.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.453
You're going

03:20.993 --> 03:22.453
to make less money."

03:22.494 --> 03:25.998
I don't really think we should

03:22.494 --> 03:25.998
be choosing color of skin

03:26.040 --> 03:29.085
because we should be showing

03:26.040 --> 03:29.085
everyone the sexual experiences

03:26.040 --> 03:29.085
that we are having,

03:29.127 --> 03:31.754
and, of course, if there's

03:29.127 --> 03:31.754
couples that are interracial,

03:31.796 --> 03:33.631
they might want

03:31.796 --> 03:33.631
to watch interracial porn.

03:33.672 --> 03:36.175
And for you to not put that

03:33.672 --> 03:36.175
out for them, and they're

03:33.672 --> 03:36.175
a fan of yours,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.094
now they have

03:36.216 --> 03:38.094
an opinion to form.

03:38.136 --> 03:41.973
It's a mainly-- It's, of course,

03:38.136 --> 03:41.973
a mainly white business,

03:42.014 --> 03:44.642
all the company owners

03:42.014 --> 03:44.642
and the agents,

03:44.683 --> 03:47.061
and they all are

03:44.683 --> 03:47.061
secretly racist.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.396
So they all tell these girls

03:47.103 --> 03:49.396
not to do this.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.149
And then I'm the one

03:49.438 --> 03:51.149
telling these girls,

03:51.190 --> 03:53.525
"I've done more interracial than

03:51.190 --> 03:53.525
regular scenes, and I'm good."

03:53.567 --> 03:56.320
But it's a fear factor

03:53.567 --> 03:56.320
for a young girl,

03:56.361 --> 03:59.157
and of course, when you look up

03:56.361 --> 03:59.157
to your agent, he's been

03:56.361 --> 03:59.157
teaching you things,

03:59.198 --> 04:00.699
you're gonna

03:59.198 --> 04:00.699
believe what he says.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.952
Then when they finally do

04:00.741 --> 04:02.952
do interracial,

04:02.994 --> 04:04.954
when they're not getting enough

04:02.994 --> 04:04.954
work doing other things,

04:04.996 --> 04:06.580
they get paid more money for it.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.249
Going to the post office myself.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.543
'Cause I want you all

04:09.291 --> 04:11.543
to get your books.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.213
And I want you to enjoy them.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.673
And I want to hear

04:14.254 --> 04:16.673
book reports, essays.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.760
So, if you want to put

04:16.714 --> 04:19.760
the boxes just down,

04:19.802 --> 04:21.303
and I'll put 'em in.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.931
I'll just have you photograph

04:21.345 --> 04:23.931
me putting 'em in here.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.100
Oh, shit. I just took a photo.

-[man chuckles]

04:26.142 --> 04:27.643
-Of nothing.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.313
All right.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.440
How many do you think

04:31.355 --> 04:33.440
I can put in at a time?

04:37.028 --> 04:38.403
More than that.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.992
Don't jam it up.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.992
Don't jam it up.

04:43.034 --> 04:45.953
These boxes took some getting

04:43.034 --> 04:45.953
used to making, you know

04:43.034 --> 04:45.953
what I mean?

04:45.995 --> 04:48.455
Like, the first ten, there's

04:45.995 --> 04:48.455
so much tape on them.

04:48.497 --> 04:51.625
Then I got a system going,

04:48.497 --> 04:51.625
you know.

04:55.213 --> 04:56.380
What does that mean?

04:59.466 --> 05:03.137
Is it stuck?

04:59.466 --> 05:03.137
Is it full?

05:03.179 --> 05:05.764
What do we do now?

05:03.179 --> 05:05.764
Is there another one?

05:05.806 --> 05:09.810
Yeah, the "Paylin" movie

05:05.806 --> 05:09.810
pretty much single-handedly

05:05.806 --> 05:09.810
changed my entire life.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.813
So I have fans coming in

05:09.852 --> 05:12.813
not because they're porn fans,

05:12.855 --> 05:14.648
just 'cause they

05:12.855 --> 05:14.648
thought that was hysterical.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.901
I have people that, like,

05:14.690 --> 05:16.901
walk up to me now places,

05:16.942 --> 05:19.528
and they're like, "Right on,"

05:16.942 --> 05:19.528
you know, "That was funny."

05:19.570 --> 05:22.073
So it's just--

05:19.570 --> 05:22.073
It broke a barrier for me.

[Man]

05:22.114 --> 05:24.075

Did you think

05:24.116 --> 05:25.617
it was gonna go...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.078
That big? No.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.289
2008 I was on set

05:27.119 --> 05:30.289

05:30.330 --> 05:32.750
and during my downtime

05:30.330 --> 05:32.750
I was checking my messages,

05:32.791 --> 05:35.044
and it was Drew from Hustler,

05:32.791 --> 05:35.044

if we could use your phone

06:01.279 --> 06:05.449
to call the Kremlin.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.619
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas,

06:05.490 --> 06:08.619
I don't speak Russian.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.038

-How you say?

06:11.080 --> 06:13.665
-Tow truck.

Well, in the spirit

06:13.707 --> 06:15.918
of foreign relations,

06:15.960 --> 06:19.588
I'm sure there's no harm in me

06:15.960 --> 06:19.588
letting the two of you in.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.673
Come on in.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.971
You know, the business

06:24.343 --> 06:26.971
lashed out at me.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.181
Girls thought

06:27.012 --> 06:29.181
I stole that scene

06:29.223 --> 06:31.350
because someone else got

06:29.223 --> 06:31.350
the phone call at my agency,

06:31.391 --> 06:33.185
but I insisted I did it.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.813
It was really weird

06:33.227 --> 06:35.813
how when you get popular,

06:35.854 --> 06:37.689
people who were

06:35.854 --> 06:37.689
nice to you last week

06:37.731 --> 06:40.567
just, like, venomously hate you

06:40.609 --> 06:42.402
and are talking about you

06:40.609 --> 06:42.402
behind your back.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.280
And at that point I realized,

06:44.322 --> 06:46.198
"Okay, well,

06:44.322 --> 06:46.198
I'm gonna have this,

"It's that Sarah Palin girl.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.562
of my fucking life."

07:17.604 --> 07:18.856
Like, it's go time.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.565
We're gonna be on the road

07:18.897 --> 07:20.565
every weekend.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.318
We're gonna do

07:20.607 --> 07:22.318
47 weekends a year.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.986
We're gonna do

07:22.360 --> 07:23.986
crazy personal appearances.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.445
We're gonna do tons of PR.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.073
Everyone was offering me

07:25.487 --> 07:28.073
these opportunities, you know?

07:28.115 --> 07:31.243
I remember getting invited

07:28.115 --> 07:31.243
to go to a couple good nude

07:28.115 --> 07:31.243
movie premieres,

07:31.285 --> 07:33.037
getting to go to some events.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.830
Those are great

07:33.078 --> 07:34.830
photo opportunities for me.

07:34.872 --> 07:38.334
And I knew that that is

07:34.872 --> 07:38.334
the way to stay relevant,

07:38.376 --> 07:40.419
to brand yourself

07:38.376 --> 07:40.419
to different fans,

07:40.460 --> 07:43.630
and to get yourself going

07:40.460 --> 07:43.630
out there in a social scene,

07:43.672 --> 07:45.216
in a different light

07:43.672 --> 07:45.216
with your clothes on.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.509
The more gigs I could do

07:47.551 --> 07:50.221
where it wasn't just about me

07:47.551 --> 07:50.221
fucking or being naked,

07:50.262 --> 07:52.806
the more I could

07:50.262 --> 07:52.806
cross-pollinate

07:52.848 --> 07:56.310
and start to get into what was

07:52.848 --> 07:56.310
gonna be my reality one day,

07:56.352 --> 07:58.520
being dressed.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.992
All these shows are on Sirius,

08:09.573 --> 08:11.992
so Sirius will hit me up,

08:12.034 --> 08:13.535
and one of the shows

08:12.034 --> 08:13.535
will hit me up and say,

08:13.577 --> 08:15.454
"Hey, so and so's coming

08:13.577 --> 08:15.454
through. Can you make it over?"

08:15.495 --> 08:16.872
'Cause they know

08:15.495 --> 08:16.872
I'm that close.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.790
So I just get a shower,

08:16.914 --> 08:18.790
get dressed and go over.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.294
These are opportunities for me

08:18.832 --> 08:22.294
that are priceless, right?

08:22.336 --> 08:25.881
And everyone just treats me

08:22.336 --> 08:25.881
like, I'm part of the family

08:22.336 --> 08:25.881
'cause I work there,

08:25.923 --> 08:28.675
and I have my own name badges,

08:25.923 --> 08:28.675
and they don't have to worry

08:25.923 --> 08:28.675
about security at all.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.969
And I feel like

08:28.717 --> 08:30.969
this little job

08:31.011 --> 08:34.681
has become the biggest

08:31.011 --> 08:34.681
opportunity of my life.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.975
Okay. I'm gonna put this

08:34.722 --> 08:36.975
plan in motion.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.518
It's gonna be a one-year plan.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.479
I'm gonna produce

08:38.559 --> 08:40.479
this many movies

08:40.520 --> 08:43.523
so I have this much content

08:40.520 --> 08:43.523
for my Web site once I retire.

08:43.565 --> 08:47.403
I was starting

08:43.565 --> 08:47.403
to plant the seeds

08:43.565 --> 08:47.403
that I wanted a sports show.

08:47.445 --> 08:51.156
I was already working for Sirius

08:47.445 --> 08:51.156
at that time out here in LA

08:51.198 --> 08:54.076
doing a very fun, sexy show

08:51.198 --> 08:54.076
called "Stripper Town."

08:54.118 --> 08:57.037
And by September 9th, 2013,

08:57.079 --> 08:59.415
I started my very

08:57.079 --> 08:59.415
first show with Sirius.

08:59.457 --> 09:01.959
"Lisa Ann Does Fantasy." It was

08:59.457 --> 09:01.959
my very first sports show.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.545
You know, I said

09:02.000 --> 09:05.545
to my girlfriend today, I was

09:02.000 --> 09:05.545
explaining this to her,

09:05.587 --> 09:07.381
and I said, "You know,

09:05.587 --> 09:07.381
you have kids and I don't.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.383
It's like being a proud parent.

09:09.425 --> 09:12.094
"When you're watching fantasy

09:09.425 --> 09:12.094
and one of your players does

09:09.425 --> 09:12.094
what you expected,

09:12.136 --> 09:13.471
"or even more

09:12.136 --> 09:13.471
than you expected,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.639
you feel like a proud parent."

09:15.680 --> 09:18.016
[Man]

09:15.680 --> 09:18.016
If a girl wants to get

09:15.680 --> 09:18.016
into the adult business now,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.435
what do you tell her?

09:19.477 --> 09:21.728
Um, I'd talk with her

09:19.477 --> 09:21.728
about why.

09:21.770 --> 09:25.232
You know, is she getting into

09:21.770 --> 09:25.232
the business 'cause she wants

09:21.770 --> 09:25.232
to explore herself sexually?

09:25.274 --> 09:29.194
She feels that she is more

09:25.274 --> 09:29.194
unique than someone else?

09:29.236 --> 09:32.072
Is she just

09:29.236 --> 09:32.072
a paycheck performer?

09:32.114 --> 09:34.699
If so, what is she looking

09:32.114 --> 09:34.699
to do, big picture?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.201
Because some girls think,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.201
you know,

09:36.243 --> 09:39.037
"I'm gonna work for a year

09:36.243 --> 09:39.037
or two and make some money

09:39.079 --> 09:41.706
and put it aside and then

09:39.079 --> 09:41.706
I'll do something else."

09:41.748 --> 09:44.543
And I'm like, "Yeah, you're not

09:41.748 --> 09:44.543
doing something else.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.338
You're gonna have at any

09:44.584 --> 09:47.338
other job, someone's gonna

09:44.584 --> 09:47.338
know what you've done."

09:47.379 --> 09:51.342
You have to be done with

09:47.379 --> 09:51.342
the business before the business

09:47.379 --> 09:51.342
is done with you.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.427
And, to many people,

09:53.469 --> 09:56.596
I've seen the business

09:53.469 --> 09:56.596
be done with them

09:53.469 --> 09:56.596
before they were ready,

09:56.638 --> 09:57.848
and it's devastating.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.808
Since I retired,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.808
I made a promise

09:59.850 --> 10:02.019
that I would read

09:59.850 --> 10:02.019
at least one book a week.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.314
And I feel like my brain

10:02.060 --> 10:05.314
was starting to go to mush

10:05.356 --> 10:08.484
because it was so easy to be

10:05.356 --> 10:08.484
the most successful porn star

10:05.356 --> 10:08.484
in the business

10:08.526 --> 10:12.863
because all I had to do

10:08.526 --> 10:12.863
was follow some really

10:08.526 --> 10:12.863
basic instructions.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.866
I don't think I could ever

10:12.904 --> 10:15.866
walk away from being

10:12.904 --> 10:15.866
Lisa Ann the porn star.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.536
I don't think there's a country

10:15.907 --> 10:18.536
that I could move to

10:18.577 --> 10:19.995
where it would be possible.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.247
I have to accept

10:20.037 --> 10:22.247
that what I put out there,

10:22.289 --> 10:24.375
and the amount of years

10:22.289 --> 10:24.375
that I put it out there,

10:24.416 --> 10:26.668
and the willingness

10:24.416 --> 10:26.668
that I put it out there,

10:26.710 --> 10:29.880
there's something to accept

10:26.710 --> 10:29.880
in return for the security

10:26.710 --> 10:29.880
that I've given myself,

10:29.921 --> 10:32.716
the way that I've been able

10:29.921 --> 10:32.716
to live, the adventures

10:29.921 --> 10:32.716
that I've had.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.344
The sidebar is, sure,

10:32.757 --> 10:35.344
everyone knows who I am,

10:35.386 --> 10:37.054
and everyone feels

10:35.386 --> 10:37.054
comfortable to approach me.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.223
You gotta understand something.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.642
There's a comfort when a guy

10:39.264 --> 10:42.642
sees me that's much different

10:42.684 --> 10:44.811
than when he sees a football

10:42.684 --> 10:44.811
player or basketball player.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.438
He has masturbated to me.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.982
When he looks at me,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.982
and we make eye contact,

10:49.024 --> 10:51.151
and that twinkle happens,

10:49.024 --> 10:51.151
and he remembers

10:49.024 --> 10:51.151
all those moments,

10:51.193 --> 10:53.195
it's a feeling,

10:51.193 --> 10:53.195
it's an adrenaline rush,

10:53.237 --> 10:54.446
it's a thing, right?

10:54.488 --> 10:57.908
I have to be so aware

10:54.488 --> 10:57.908
that I put it out there.

10:57.949 --> 11:01.328
Who would I be to say,

10:57.949 --> 11:01.328
"No, I don't want any of you

10:57.949 --> 11:01.328
to talk about this anymore.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.205
I want this to go away.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.205
I'm no longer her."

11:03.247 --> 11:04.998
I'm still her.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.998
I was naked.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.751
There's no shield

11:05.040 --> 11:07.751
I was wearing that

11:05.040 --> 11:07.751
covered me from being me.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.712
And I used my real name,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.712
so, you know.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.470
[lively chattering]

11:18.512 --> 11:20.556
[Woman]

11:18.512 --> 11:20.556
I am in porn, yes,

11:20.598 --> 11:23.141
but I'm also in

11:20.598 --> 11:23.141
the transgender industry,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.018
which is a very small niche.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.273
So in order for one to be able

11:25.060 --> 11:29.273
to excel and have an exit plan,

11:29.314 --> 11:31.442
you have to produce,

11:29.314 --> 11:31.442
you have to direct.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.485
You have to take control

11:31.483 --> 11:33.485
of your own brand

11:33.527 --> 11:36.196
and be able to dictate

11:33.527 --> 11:36.196
your own future.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.074
So, with that said,

11:36.238 --> 11:39.074
that's why I've worked so hard

11:39.116 --> 11:41.785
to get these accolades

11:39.116 --> 11:41.785
and be able to brand myself

11:41.826 --> 11:43.412
as a top performer.

11:43.454 --> 11:47.999
And eventually

11:43.454 --> 11:47.999
be able to develop

11:43.454 --> 11:47.999
my own modeling agency,

11:48.041 --> 11:50.794
and get in and get out, right?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.130
And have a family of my own.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.923
So, I'm 25 now,

11:54.965 --> 11:56.467
so I got a couple

11:54.965 --> 11:56.467
more years to go

11:56.508 --> 11:59.553
before I definitely want

11:56.508 --> 11:59.553
to have children of my own.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.282
have my life to live over--

12:20.324 --> 12:22.367
What would you do?

13:17.589 --> 13:20.718

13:45.283 --> 13:47.244
"Of course not."

13:45.283 --> 13:47.244
So I sat down,

13:45.283 --> 13:47.244
we read the scene.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.329
And I'm chewing up the script,

13:49.371 --> 13:51.498
you know, I'm having

13:49.371 --> 13:51.498
a great time with this.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.208
And after the guy leaves,

13:53.250 --> 13:54.376
he leans over,

13:53.250 --> 13:54.376
he said,

13:54.418 --> 13:57.212
"Would you like

13:54.418 --> 13:57.212
to play the role?"

13:57.254 --> 14:03.260
A lead role in a real movie?

13:57.254 --> 14:03.260
Well, I guess so.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.929
I said, "Can I cook too?"

14:03.301 --> 14:05.929
He said, "Yeah."

14:05.970 --> 14:07.681
He said, "I'll pay you

14:05.970 --> 14:07.681
100 a day for acting,

14:07.723 --> 14:09.349
and 45 a day to cook."

14:09.391 --> 14:12.561
That was a killing for us

14:09.391 --> 14:12.561
in those days, let me tell you.

14:12.603 --> 14:16.481
So we went toddling out

14:12.603 --> 14:16.481
to some place in New Jersey.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.900
And so help me, Your Honor,

14:16.523 --> 14:18.900
I think it was New Jersey.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.362
It could have been New York.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.362
I have no idea where it was.

14:22.404 --> 14:26.991
It was a big old deserted farm,

14:22.404 --> 14:26.991
with a big old barn.

14:27.033 --> 14:31.037
And they moved the film

14:27.033 --> 14:31.037
equipment into the barn,

14:31.079 --> 14:33.582
and we lived in the barn,

14:31.079 --> 14:33.582
and we shot in the barn,

14:33.624 --> 14:35.751
and we got in the cars

14:33.624 --> 14:35.751
and we went home.

14:35.793 --> 14:39.170
And that's how I did

14:35.793 --> 14:39.170
"The Devil in Miss Jones."

14:39.212 --> 14:44.175
I have no idea why

14:39.212 --> 14:44.175
"The Devil in Miss Jones,"

14:44.217 --> 14:48.388
a fuck film, let's face it,

14:44.217 --> 14:48.388
a porno, a pornographic film,

14:48.430 --> 14:50.641
resonated as it did

14:50.682 --> 14:55.353
with such a great range of

14:50.682 --> 14:55.353
American society of that time.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.189
But for some reason, boy,

14:55.395 --> 14:58.189
it just splashed over

14:58.231 --> 15:03.654
into something that Judith Crist

14:58.231 --> 15:03.654
dubbed "porn chic."

15:03.695 --> 15:05.823
If you touch me, I can get off.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.492
We'll get off together.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.492
[panting]

15:08.533 --> 15:12.287
If you just...

15:08.533 --> 15:12.287
just put your cock in me.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.915
Would you like to put

15:12.329 --> 15:15.915
your cock in me?

15:12.329 --> 15:15.915
Then we can get off.

15:15.957 --> 15:20.128
[laughs]

15:15.957 --> 15:20.128
People were going as couples

15:20.170 --> 15:23.173
to see hardcore

15:20.170 --> 15:23.173
pornographic films,

15:23.214 --> 15:24.299
to see sex films.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.637
I mean, nice couples.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.931
At the time, I had no idea

15:28.679 --> 15:31.931
that anyone I knew,

15:31.973 --> 15:34.142
much less anyone that

15:31.973 --> 15:34.142
I was related to

15:34.184 --> 15:35.935
would ever see this film.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.481
And, um, they did.

15:39.523 --> 15:40.774
[chuckles]

15:40.816 --> 15:43.151
And I had to say,

15:40.816 --> 15:43.151
"Yeah, that was me."

15:43.193 --> 15:46.488
"Yes, brother dear,

15:43.193 --> 15:46.488
that was your sister."

15:46.530 --> 15:50.074
It was a moment of truth

15:46.530 --> 15:50.074
in my life.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.288
And I said,

15:52.661 --> 15:55.288
"How's Mom taking it?"

15:55.330 --> 15:57.165
And he said,

15:55.330 --> 15:57.165
"Well, you know Mom.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.084
She rolls with any punch

15:57.207 --> 16:00.084
that comes her way,"

16:00.126 --> 16:01.920
and she did, you know.

16:03.963 --> 16:10.011
Uh, she never said

16:03.963 --> 16:10.011
"I forgive you."

16:10.053 --> 16:15.183
But she almost said,

16:10.053 --> 16:15.183
"I understand" before she died.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.397
I didn't exactly

16:17.895 --> 16:20.397
exit the business.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.566
The business

16:20.438 --> 16:22.566
kind of exited me.

16:22.607 --> 16:26.361
Every film I made was the last

16:22.607 --> 16:26.361
film I was ever gonna do.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.446
I never sought out the films.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.533
People would call me and ask me

16:28.488 --> 16:31.533
if I would work, if I was busy.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.159
And I usually would say,

16:33.201 --> 16:37.038
"Well, I don't really want to,

16:33.201 --> 16:37.038
but okay, one more."

16:37.080 --> 16:41.543
So I got this very good job,

16:37.080 --> 16:41.543
and it was a nine-to-five job

16:41.585 --> 16:42.836
and took up my time.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.547
Now and then I would

16:42.878 --> 16:45.547
get a call to do a film,

16:45.589 --> 16:49.050
and I would take

16:45.589 --> 16:49.050
a week's vacation

16:49.092 --> 16:51.052
and run off and do a film.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.138
And one day, my boss

16:51.094 --> 16:54.138
called me in and said,

16:54.180 --> 16:57.726
"Are you going off

16:54.180 --> 16:57.726
to do one of those films?"

16:57.768 --> 17:00.270
And I said, "Well, yeah."

17:00.311 --> 17:02.689
He said, "It's been brought

17:00.311 --> 17:02.689
to my attention

17:02.731 --> 17:06.568
"that some of the board

17:02.731 --> 17:06.568
of directors are aware

17:06.609 --> 17:08.569
that you have done

17:06.609 --> 17:08.569
some of these films."

17:08.612 --> 17:12.198
And I said, "This is

17:08.612 --> 17:12.198
the last one, I promise."

17:12.240 --> 17:14.952
He said, "Oh, okay.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.952
I'll tell them that."

17:14.992 --> 17:18.329
And it was.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.329
[laughs]

17:18.371 --> 17:21.290
I don't know what

17:18.371 --> 17:21.290
today's adult films are.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.586
I presume

17:21.332 --> 17:24.586
it's all on the Web.

17:24.627 --> 17:29.299
Or on video tape

17:24.627 --> 17:29.299
or cassettes or some media.

17:29.340 --> 17:33.720
I doubt if there are

17:29.340 --> 17:33.720

17:29.340 --> 17:33.720

17:39.643 --> 17:42.646

17:39.643 --> 17:42.646
and dumped the popcorn.

By and large,

17:49.360 --> 17:52.781
it's been a delightful trip.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.784
I now and then

17:52.823 --> 17:55.784
get the feeling,

17:55.826 --> 17:59.454
yeah, there's probably a big

17:55.826 --> 17:59.454
waterfall somewhere

17:59.496 --> 18:00.831
there in the distance.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.416
I can kind of hear it

18:00.872 --> 18:03.416
rumbling now and then,

18:03.458 --> 18:06.628
but what am I gonna

18:03.458 --> 18:06.628
do about it?

18:06.670 --> 18:09.130
The things I am

18:06.670 --> 18:09.130
most grateful for

18:09.172 --> 18:11.675
are having met

18:09.172 --> 18:11.675
the love of my life--

18:11.716 --> 18:14.218
not everybody gets to do that--

18:14.260 --> 18:16.721
and having not only met

18:14.260 --> 18:16.721
the love of my life,

18:16.763 --> 18:19.975
having him feel

18:16.763 --> 18:19.975
the same way about me,

18:20.017 --> 18:22.853
so that we could

18:20.017 --> 18:22.853
build a life together

18:22.894 --> 18:25.981
in this absolutely

18:22.894 --> 18:25.981
delightful little paradise

18:26.023 --> 18:27.899
that we get to call home,

18:27.941 --> 18:30.735
here under the glorious

18:27.941 --> 18:30.735

18:35.949 --> 18:38.910
In my world-- I'm also

18:35.949 --> 18:38.910
a psychic reader for a living--

18:38.952 --> 18:41.454
so, we don't have time lines

18:41.496 --> 18:44.290
because time is infinite

18:41.496 --> 18:44.290
in my world.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.751
So there's no exit or entrance.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.714
It's just all a big giant

18:46.793 --> 18:50.714
conglomeration of joy and love.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.757
So, no, I don't have

18:50.755 --> 18:52.757
an answer to that question.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.386
But I plan to dance, perform,

18:56.427 --> 18:59.347
dance with snakes and play,

18:56.427 --> 18:59.347
until I feel

18:59.389 --> 19:01.683
that my heart tells me

18:59.389 --> 19:01.683
to do something different.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.852
So, it could be infinite,

19:03.894 --> 19:05.478
it could be tomorrow,

it could be yesterday,

21:52.854 --> 21:54.064
-Good job.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.064
-Thank you, sir.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.733
Congratulations, recruit.

21:56.774 --> 21:57.901
Thank you.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.070
Good job.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.070
Mmm.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.655
Then, when you get on

22:00.111 --> 22:02.655
the outside, it's like,

22:00.111 --> 22:02.655
"Wait a minute.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.949
"This was reality.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.949
I need a job."

22:04.991 --> 22:06.701
I fell into the porn industry

22:06.743 --> 22:09.370
and it was just

22:06.743 --> 22:09.370
one gig after another.

22:09.412 --> 22:13.708
-[rapid gunfire]

22:09.412 --> 22:13.708
-[plane engines roaring]

22:13.750 --> 22:16.502
Around the time

22:13.750 --> 22:16.502
when I was working,

22:16.544 --> 22:19.089
I couldn't recall

22:16.544 --> 22:19.089
if I got it there.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.632
I couldn't even tell you if

22:19.130 --> 22:21.632
I got it before I left.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.593
We just don't know

22:21.674 --> 22:23.593
'cause I worked so much

22:23.634 --> 22:26.763
at that period of time

22:23.634 --> 22:26.763
when I was infected.

22:26.804 --> 22:31.101
But I remember I wasn't feeling

22:26.804 --> 22:31.101
as hot when I got to Brazil

22:31.142 --> 22:33.477
at this one particular

22:31.142 --> 22:33.477
time I was working.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.980
We were doing a huge orgy.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.566
It was probably my

22:36.022 --> 22:38.566
second orgy when I got there.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.235
I was so tired and exhausted.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.153
I thought it was

22:40.277 --> 22:42.153
just I was overworked.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.115
Learning how this virus works,

22:45.156 --> 22:48.118
that's probably at the time

22:45.156 --> 22:48.118
where I was probably infected

22:48.159 --> 22:49.702
and didn't even know.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.871
It's hard to conclude

22:49.744 --> 22:51.871
and come to a conclusion

22:51.913 --> 22:53.998
where I got it.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.998
That's the problem.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.792
That's the gray area.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.501
I just-- You know,

22:55.833 --> 22:57.501
if I had a condom,

22:57.543 --> 22:59.837
this probably

22:57.543 --> 22:59.837
wouldn't have happened.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.923
Period. This probably

22:59.879 --> 23:01.923
wouldn't have happened.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.638
You know, I'm not thinking

23:06.219 --> 23:08.638
this stuff would ever happen.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.057
The porn industry, this would

23:08.679 --> 23:11.057
never-- I would never get this.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.559
But the way my

23:11.099 --> 23:13.559
career ended was

23:13.601 --> 23:15.603
my family was in the church.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.316
I get diagnosed, same time,

23:19.357 --> 23:21.025
it's all over

23:19.357 --> 23:21.025
the news in Detroit.

23:22.319 --> 23:24.237
So people

23:22.319 --> 23:24.237
finding out right there.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.365
But for some reason,

23:27.406 --> 23:28.992
the church

23:27.406 --> 23:28.992
was smart enough--

23:29.033 --> 23:30.534
I haven't seen these

23:29.033 --> 23:30.534
people in years--

23:30.576 --> 23:32.495
now keep in mind,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.495
I was gone for years.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.789
I've been gone from home,

23:34.831 --> 23:37.917
and these people

23:34.831 --> 23:37.917
protected me even then.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.045
They stood up for me

23:39.460 --> 23:41.045
even then.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.880
I didn't know

23:41.087 --> 23:42.880
till I heard later.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.927
They stood up by me even then.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.937
If it wasn't for the individuals

23:54.433 --> 23:57.937
I've met in my past,

23:57.979 --> 24:00.898
I still had that memory, like,

23:57.979 --> 24:00.898
all these Navy SEALs that I met

24:00.940 --> 24:03.193
or military guys that I met

24:00.940 --> 24:03.193
that did martial arts.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.236
They groomed me.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.236
I just brought that back.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.072
Brought that back home

24:05.278 --> 24:08.072
and just got off my ass.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.574
Got off the couch one day.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.574
Get back in the gym.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.370
'Cause, you know, I can't

24:10.616 --> 24:13.370
help nobody if I ain't

24:10.616 --> 24:13.370
helping myself.

24:13.411 --> 24:16.539
'Cause being a public speaker,

24:13.411 --> 24:16.539
you gotta be able to back up

24:13.411 --> 24:16.539
what you're preaching.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.292
You know, they don't want

24:16.580 --> 24:19.292
to look at somebody

24:16.580 --> 24:19.292
that's all falling apart,

24:19.334 --> 24:22.086
typical stigma

24:19.334 --> 24:22.086
of being a positive.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.214
"Oh, this guy looks sickly."

24:22.128 --> 24:24.214
Fuck that.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.798
You know, I gotta do it, man.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.550
You gotta get out

24:25.840 --> 24:27.550
and do something.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.260
You know? And keep giving.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.471
As much as I can

24:29.302 --> 24:32.471
while I still got time

24:29.302 --> 24:32.471
on the clock.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.392
And I got a lot more work

24:32.513 --> 24:35.392
to do. You know?

24:35.433 --> 24:37.018
Who knows?

24:35.433 --> 24:37.018
Maybe somebody will see me,

24:37.060 --> 24:39.187
and just do the same to help

24:37.060 --> 24:39.187
somebody else, that's all.

24:39.229 --> 24:41.939
-Help, that bar?

24:39.229 --> 24:41.939
-Yup.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.442
Rich Piano showed me that.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.442
Just do the quick shit.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.027
[laughing]

24:46.069 --> 24:48.029
[James]

24:46.069 --> 24:48.029
A lot of times when

24:46.069 --> 24:48.029
you've diagnosed,

24:48.071 --> 24:49.447
people, you know,

24:48.071 --> 24:49.447
we get in denial.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.990
I've been there.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.990
You don't wanna do nothing.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.533
Ah, just give up.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.533
You can't.

24:52.575 --> 24:56.787
Just like cancer, any kind

24:52.575 --> 24:56.787
of illness that you get,

24:56.829 --> 24:58.373
man, you gotta get up

24:56.829 --> 24:58.373
and move on.

24:58.415 --> 25:02.043
You get better by doing

24:58.415 --> 25:02.043
something for yourself,

24:58.415 --> 25:02.043
you know?

25:02.085 --> 25:05.255
I'll tell anybody else,

25:02.085 --> 25:05.255
we all survivors

25:02.085 --> 25:05.255
when it comes to this.

25:05.296 --> 25:09.217
You know, this is not

25:05.296 --> 25:09.217
gonna be a tragedy for me.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.301
It's a beginning.

25:13.346 --> 25:17.475
I regret that

25:13.346 --> 25:17.475
I didn't get out at the time

25:13.346 --> 25:17.475
when I was supposed to.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.685
'Cause there was one period

25:17.516 --> 25:19.685
I did get out. I quit.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.813
I just didn't want to do it.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.813
You know, my morals kicked in.

25:22.855 --> 25:27.318
And then somebody called me back

25:22.855 --> 25:27.318
with a decent budget.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.362
And we could probably

25:27.360 --> 25:29.362
get you in a contract.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.863
I jumped on it.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.950
I should have got out.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.995
That's what I regret.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.995
I didn't make that move.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.831
Far as anything else, I miss

25:38.037 --> 25:40.831
the travels and the people.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.750
Behind the scenes, the crew.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.711
You know, I met some really

25:42.792 --> 25:45.711
interesting people that

25:42.792 --> 25:45.711
opened my eyes.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.671
There is good people

25:45.753 --> 25:47.671
in the industry.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.006
There is a lot

25:47.713 --> 25:49.006
of good people.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.050
But you can't talk, you know?

25:51.092 --> 25:52.843
You go against

25:51.092 --> 25:52.843
the grain, you're out.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.097
That was their income.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.097
Like anybody else, we're

25:52.885 --> 25:56.097
all making a living.

25:56.139 --> 26:00.143
But being able to stand up

25:56.139 --> 26:00.143
against that,

26:00.184 --> 26:02.312
the first one in history

26:00.184 --> 26:02.312
to stand up against...

26:02.353 --> 26:05.440
I think to go so hardcore

26:02.353 --> 26:05.440
against the industry,

26:05.482 --> 26:08.692
to show that they had some

26:05.482 --> 26:08.692
things that were wrong

26:05.482 --> 26:08.692
and then address it...

26:10.278 --> 26:12.029
I don't regret that.

26:12.071 --> 26:16.409
Because you can't save

26:12.071 --> 26:16.409
everybody, but I can try.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.702
They're not gonna like it,

26:16.451 --> 26:18.702
but I'll keep trying.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.712
In California, there is

26:26.627 --> 26:28.712
a push right now,

26:28.754 --> 26:30.507
primarily from one organization,

26:30.548 --> 26:33.717
to try and force performers

26:30.548 --> 26:33.717
to wear condoms

26:33.759 --> 26:36.387
amongst other safety gear,

26:33.759 --> 26:36.387
at all times.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.264
And the truth of the matter is

26:38.306 --> 26:40.641
there are negative

26:38.306 --> 26:40.641
effects of condoms.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.601
But we're not allowed

26:40.683 --> 26:42.601
to talk about them

26:42.643 --> 26:45.688
because it's so difficult

26:42.643 --> 26:45.688
to get people to use them

26:42.643 --> 26:45.688
in the first place.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.399
You can imagine that's not

26:45.729 --> 26:48.399
a very popular topic.

26:48.441 --> 26:51.777
The truth of the matter is

26:48.441 --> 26:51.777
when people use condoms,

26:51.819 --> 26:53.488
as compared

26:51.819 --> 26:53.488
to not using condoms,

26:53.530 --> 26:56.157
it's been tested with people

26:53.530 --> 26:56.157
within the same partner,

26:56.199 --> 26:58.784
that condom use does

26:56.199 --> 26:58.784
increase the presence

26:58.826 --> 27:01.329
of three different types

26:58.826 --> 27:01.329
of bacteria, at least,

26:58.826 --> 27:01.329
in the vagina,

27:01.371 --> 27:04.040
and also causes erythema,

27:01.371 --> 27:04.040
or a reddening in the vulva,

27:04.081 --> 27:06.584
which is consistent

27:04.081 --> 27:06.584
with more tearing.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.295
So if the performers

27:06.625 --> 27:09.295
are testing,

27:09.337 --> 27:11.130
and they know

27:09.337 --> 27:11.130
that they're clean,

27:11.172 --> 27:12.840
by using condoms,

27:11.172 --> 27:12.840
they're probably

27:12.882 --> 27:15.134
increasing their risk

27:12.882 --> 27:15.134
of bacterial infection.

27:15.176 --> 27:18.762
So they actually have a really

27:15.176 --> 27:18.762
good ground to argue against

27:18.804 --> 27:21.015
the use of condoms,

27:18.804 --> 27:21.015
especially in the context,

27:21.057 --> 27:22.600
in the way that

27:21.057 --> 27:22.600
they're using them.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.686
Because there is some associated

27:22.641 --> 27:25.686
increased risk with it.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.022
However, you can

27:25.728 --> 27:28.022
imagine the knee-jerk

27:28.064 --> 27:30.233
to that kind of response.

27:30.274 --> 27:34.028
Especially, you know, I work

27:30.274 --> 27:34.028
with a lot of HIV researchers.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.447
We do not want

27:34.070 --> 27:36.447
to have this conversation.

27:36.489 --> 27:40.618
Just because it's so difficult

27:36.489 --> 27:40.618
to get people who aren't being

27:36.489 --> 27:40.618
tested like the performers are

27:40.659 --> 27:42.412
to use condoms

27:40.659 --> 27:42.412
in the first place.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.163
We would hate

27:42.453 --> 27:44.163
to discourage their use

27:44.205 --> 27:45.956
amongst those type of folks.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.042
But I think amongst performers,

27:48.084 --> 27:50.836
it's probably very reasonable

27:48.084 --> 27:50.836
to let them make that decision.

28:02.848 --> 28:07.186
This painting is the quickest

28:02.848 --> 28:07.186
painting I've ever done.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.146
My boyfriend and I were--

28:09.188 --> 28:11.232
You know how you get in

28:09.188 --> 28:11.232
little spats, little fights?

28:11.274 --> 28:13.234
We were fighting

28:11.274 --> 28:13.234
and I went to bed,

28:13.276 --> 28:16.279
and I couldn't sleep.

28:13.276 --> 28:16.279
I was furious with him.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.739
And I got up, it was

28:16.320 --> 28:18.739
three o'clock in the morning,

28:18.781 --> 28:21.700
and I came down and I grabbed

28:18.781 --> 28:21.700
my biggest canvas that I had,

28:21.742 --> 28:24.287
and just let it all out.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.913
That's how most

28:24.328 --> 28:25.913
of my paintings go.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.916
You know, I don't have any

28:25.955 --> 28:28.916
training, it's just what I feel.

28:28.958 --> 28:31.210
So, this one

28:28.958 --> 28:31.210
is called "Mad Love."

28:31.252 --> 28:32.836
[laughs]

28:32.878 --> 28:35.172
And it's actually

28:32.878 --> 28:35.172
one of my favorites.

28:44.807 --> 28:48.144
Grr. Arf. Arf.

28:44.807 --> 28:48.144
Give it up.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.438
[Ginger Lynn]

28:48.185 --> 28:50.438
I'm originally from

28:48.185 --> 28:50.438
Rockford, Illinois.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.983
And there are two things

28:50.480 --> 28:53.983
that came out of Rockford

28:50.480 --> 28:53.983
that are famous.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.235
Cheap Trick, and Ginger Lynn.

28:56.277 --> 29:00.239
[rock music playing]

29:07.163 --> 29:10.207
Porn, it had gone from

29:07.163 --> 29:10.207
the place where

29:10.249 --> 29:12.627
you sat in a theater

29:10.249 --> 29:12.627
in your raincoat and jerked off

29:12.669 --> 29:16.172
to you bought a VCR, and you

29:12.669 --> 29:16.172
got a Ginger Lynn movie.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.967
I was one of the first girls

29:20.009 --> 29:22.428
that didn't look like

29:20.009 --> 29:22.428
I did what I did.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.306
I became

29:22.470 --> 29:25.306
so well known so quickly.

29:25.348 --> 29:28.392
A lot of mainstream actors

29:25.348 --> 29:28.392
knew who I was.

29:28.434 --> 29:32.062
They were as excited to meet me

29:28.434 --> 29:32.062
as I was to meet them.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.649
I was, you know,

29:32.104 --> 29:34.649
their first porn.

29:38.361 --> 29:41.155
-In the '80s when it was

29:38.361 --> 29:41.155
cool to be a porn star...

29:38.361 --> 29:41.155
-[Man] Yeah.

29:41.197 --> 29:44.325
...and celebrities

29:41.197 --> 29:44.325
wanted to meet you,

29:44.367 --> 29:47.786
I went to lunch

29:44.367 --> 29:47.786
with my attorney,

29:47.828 --> 29:49.455
and Milton Berle...

29:50.707 --> 29:52.542
I'm 21 years old,

29:52.583 --> 29:54.251
I'm sitting in

29:52.583 --> 29:54.251
this old Hollywood,

29:54.293 --> 29:57.838
dark wood,

29:54.293 --> 29:57.838
red leather seat restaurant,

29:57.880 --> 30:01.300
and I'm in between

29:57.880 --> 30:01.300
my attorney and Milton Berle,

30:01.342 --> 30:05.638
and Milton Berle unzips his

30:01.342 --> 30:05.638
pants and whips his dick out.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.224
Just whips it right out

30:05.680 --> 30:08.224
in the restaurant

30:08.265 --> 30:10.309
right in front of me.

30:10.351 --> 30:13.354
And I'm trying

30:10.351 --> 30:13.354
to maintain eye contact,

30:13.396 --> 30:15.690
but it's very difficult.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.690
I kept looking down at it.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.693
He never tried anything,

30:15.732 --> 30:18.693
didn't try to touch me,

30:18.735 --> 30:20.986
didn't play with it,

30:18.735 --> 30:20.986
he just whipped it out

30:21.028 --> 30:23.947
and let it hang the whole

30:21.028 --> 30:23.947
dinner-- the whole lunch.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.366
[Man]

30:23.989 --> 30:25.366
Are the stories true?

30:25.408 --> 30:28.035
Oh, it's huge! It's huge!

30:28.077 --> 30:30.621
He would give John Holmes

30:28.077 --> 30:30.621
a run for the money.

30:30.663 --> 30:34.375
Big, huge, honkin' dick.

30:30.663 --> 30:34.375
[laughs]

30:34.417 --> 30:39.838
I started my adult film career

30:34.417 --> 30:39.838
December 9th, 1983.

30:39.880 --> 30:44.051
I turned 21 five days later

30:39.880 --> 30:44.051
on December 14th.

30:44.093 --> 30:47.638
I filmed until

30:44.093 --> 30:47.638
February 11th 1986.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.015
But the thing I remember

30:47.680 --> 30:50.015
about that last day--

30:50.057 --> 30:52.351
It was a couple weeks

30:50.057 --> 30:52.351
before I quit,

30:52.393 --> 30:53.477
I woke up,

30:53.519 --> 30:55.479
and most days I would

30:53.519 --> 30:55.479
wake up and go,

30:55.521 --> 30:57.690
"Yes! I'm going to have

30:55.521 --> 30:57.690
sex with this person today!

30:57.732 --> 30:59.776
"I'm gonna fuck that person,

30:57.732 --> 30:59.776
eat this pussy,"

30:59.817 --> 31:01.318
and I would be so excited.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.154
I woke up this

31:01.360 --> 31:04.154
one particular morning

31:04.196 --> 31:05.782
and I said to myself,

31:05.823 --> 31:08.909
I don't want to fuck today.

31:05.823 --> 31:08.909
I'm done."

31:08.951 --> 31:11.829
So, I was under contract

31:08.951 --> 31:11.829
with Vivid Video at the time.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.497
I went into Vivid and said,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.497
you know,

31:13.539 --> 31:15.458
I talked to the owner and said,

31:15.499 --> 31:19.169
"My head's not in the right

31:15.499 --> 31:19.169
place and I can't do this."

31:19.211 --> 31:21.589
He said, "Cool, I understand.

31:21.631 --> 31:23.215
"Is there any way

31:21.631 --> 31:23.215
that you could finish

31:23.257 --> 31:25.384
"your last two

31:23.257 --> 31:25.384
films under contract?"

31:25.426 --> 31:27.303
And I said yes.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.180
And February 11th,

31:27.344 --> 31:30.180
I came home,

31:30.222 --> 31:32.224
and my boyfriend

31:30.222 --> 31:32.224
had taken our bathtub

31:32.266 --> 31:36.520
and filled it with gallons

31:32.266 --> 31:36.520
and gallons and gallons of milk

31:36.562 --> 31:38.272
and white rose petals.

31:38.314 --> 31:42.276
And I had a cleansing bath that

31:38.314 --> 31:42.276
I was done with the business.

31:42.318 --> 31:46.071
And there was something

31:42.318 --> 31:46.071
really romantic about that.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.282
It was like,

31:46.113 --> 31:48.282
it really was a cleansing.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.451
And not that there's anything

31:48.324 --> 31:50.451
bad about what I did,

31:50.493 --> 31:53.412
but I was moving on

31:50.493 --> 31:53.412
to another phase of my life.

31:53.454 --> 31:55.581
When I quit, I didn't think

31:53.454 --> 31:55.581
about the big picture.

31:55.623 --> 31:56.707
What am I gonna do next?

31:56.749 --> 31:58.334
I owned a house

31:56.749 --> 31:58.334
in Beverly Hills.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.960
I had a mortgage to pay.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.842
I guess I would say yes,

32:05.883 --> 32:08.135
I did always want to be in

32:05.883 --> 32:08.135
the entertainment business

32:08.177 --> 32:10.929
without really realizing it.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.098
And I am now.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.142
So I broke into

32:13.140 --> 32:15.142
the mainstream arena.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.603
I worked on dozens of films.

32:17.645 --> 32:20.022
I've got a new film coming out

32:17.645 --> 32:20.022
called "Lost Souls."

32:20.063 --> 32:22.399
-Oh, wow.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.399
-Should be out for Halloween.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.276
Another film.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.779
I have a very small role in

32:24.318 --> 32:26.779
the Coen Brothers new film

32:24.318 --> 32:26.779
"The Big Lebowski."

32:26.821 --> 32:28.572
-What else?

32:26.821 --> 32:28.572
-Oh, wow.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.949
"Wing Commander: Prophecy"

32:28.614 --> 32:30.949
with Mark Hamill

32:28.614 --> 32:30.949
will be out for Christmas.

32:30.991 --> 32:34.286
And "God's Lonely Man"

32:30.991 --> 32:34.286
with Justine Bateman

32:30.991 --> 32:34.286
will be out soon.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.788
Wow!

32:35.830 --> 32:39.166
This is gonna sound awful.

32:35.830 --> 32:39.166
I was having really shitty sex.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.711
I couldn't find a lover

32:39.208 --> 32:41.711
that could satisfy me

32:41.752 --> 32:43.671
to save my life for years.

32:43.713 --> 32:46.173
I just wanted

32:43.713 --> 32:46.173
to get fucked good.

32:46.215 --> 32:49.092
I just really wanted--

32:46.215 --> 32:49.092
I wanted to have sex with girls.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.594
I wanted to get fucked by boys.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.638
I wanted to--

32:50.636 --> 32:52.638
I wanted good sex.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.516
So I went to Vivid,

32:52.680 --> 32:55.516
I went to Wicked,

32:55.558 --> 33:00.062
and I went to VCA,

32:55.558 --> 33:00.062
and made exorbitant requests.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.022
Making a comeback,

33:00.103 --> 33:02.022
this is what I want.

33:02.064 --> 33:04.650
Get all three of the companies,

33:02.064 --> 33:04.650
made me an offer,

33:04.692 --> 33:06.819
and I decided

33:04.692 --> 33:06.819
to go with VCA.

33:06.861 --> 33:08.696
And there's a film I did

33:06.861 --> 33:08.696
called "Taken."

33:08.738 --> 33:12.449
The director was Veronica Hart.

33:08.738 --> 33:12.449
She came to me and she said,

33:12.491 --> 33:15.369
"Ginger, you know, I just don't

33:12.491 --> 33:15.369
think this is gonna happen.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.955
"And I think you're the only

33:15.411 --> 33:17.955
actress that can pull this off.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.707
"I want to make it into a porn,

33:19.749 --> 33:21.876
and I want you

33:19.749 --> 33:21.876
to be the star in it."

33:21.918 --> 33:23.794
I won best actress for

33:21.918 --> 33:23.794
that film that year.

33:23.836 --> 33:27.965
And it's the only

33:23.836 --> 33:27.965
best actress award I've won

33:23.836 --> 33:27.965
that I thought I deserved.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.300
I'd become an actress.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.971
A lot of people

33:32.344 --> 33:33.971
that get into porn,

33:34.012 --> 33:35.681
there is no life after porn.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.641
They don't know

33:35.723 --> 33:37.641
what to do with themselves.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.603
And if you're known as

33:37.683 --> 33:40.603
a sex object your whole life

33:40.644 --> 33:42.563
and sex is all you know,

33:42.605 --> 33:44.565
where do you go?

33:42.605 --> 33:44.565
How do you apply for a job?

33:44.607 --> 33:48.235
You know, I've been fucking

33:44.607 --> 33:48.235
on film for the last 30 years?

33:48.277 --> 33:50.863
And it's important that you

33:48.277 --> 33:50.863
think about your future.

33:50.905 --> 33:54.283
You think about what's

33:50.905 --> 33:54.283
going to happen afterwards.

33:54.324 --> 33:55.868
I've been really lucky with--

33:55.910 --> 33:57.661
you know,

33:55.910 --> 33:57.661
I started three Web sites

33:57.703 --> 34:01.331
as well as doing my paintings

34:01.373 --> 34:03.375
and everything,

34:01.373 --> 34:03.375
I have my auction site.

34:03.417 --> 34:06.503
Ginger Lynn Auctions dot com,

34:03.417 --> 34:06.503
Ginger Lynn dot com,

34:06.545 --> 34:09.757
and my art site, which is

34:06.545 --> 34:09.757
Ginger Lynn Art dot com.

34:09.799 --> 34:12.802
So I've always got a lot

34:09.799 --> 34:12.802
of different eggs in the basket

34:12.842 --> 34:15.012
and things to fall back on.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.513
'Cause it scares me.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.431
You know, I don't want to be 60

34:18.474 --> 34:20.935
and have nothing to show

34:18.474 --> 34:20.935
what I've worked for.

34:23.771 --> 34:27.733
I did a half-a-dozen films

34:23.771 --> 34:27.733
in, like, 2005.

34:29.652 --> 34:32.529
I wouldn't recommend anybody

34:29.652 --> 34:32.529
get into the business today.

34:32.571 --> 34:36.199
I just wouldn't.

34:32.571 --> 34:36.199
It's changed so much.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.702
I had been cast on a film,

34:38.744 --> 34:41.621
and there was somebody else

34:38.744 --> 34:41.621
doing a scene before me,

34:41.664 --> 34:45.458
very famous, very well known

34:41.664 --> 34:45.458
actress in the business,

34:45.501 --> 34:47.043
good friend of mine.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.630
And she was

34:47.085 --> 34:49.630
sitting on the sofa,

34:49.672 --> 34:51.924
and there was her costar

34:49.672 --> 34:51.924
on the other end of the sofa.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.592
This is before filming.

34:53.634 --> 34:56.386
I used to get in trouble

34:53.634 --> 34:56.386
on every single set.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.181
Once my makeup was done,

34:56.428 --> 34:59.181
I'm on you.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.391
I'd be sucking your dick,

34:59.222 --> 35:01.391
I'd be kissing you, you know,

35:01.433 --> 35:03.060
and then have to redo my makeup.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.355
I'd get in trouble all the time

35:03.101 --> 35:06.355
because I wanted to be there.

35:06.396 --> 35:10.985
These two people sat

35:06.396 --> 35:10.985
on opposite ends of the sofa

35:06.396 --> 35:10.985
on their phones.

35:11.027 --> 35:14.154
And then they called, you know,

35:11.027 --> 35:14.154
"We're ready for you on set,"

35:11.027 --> 35:14.154
and they just went and fucked.

35:14.196 --> 35:17.574
There was no connection,

42:56.241 --> 42:57.826

43:05.917 --> 43:08.253
and she's like...

43:05.917 --> 43:08.253
"Eh," right?

43:08.295 --> 43:10.297
So, they said, "Okay, Johnnie.

43:10.339 --> 43:12.674
"Get back up off the pussy

43:10.339 --> 43:12.674
and walk back through

43:10.339 --> 43:12.674

43:12.715 --> 43:15.260
They pick Marilyn up

43:12.715 --> 43:15.260
and bring her over on the side

43:15.302 --> 43:18.054
and put smelling salts

43:15.302 --> 43:18.054

43:15.302 --> 43:18.054

43:18.096 --> 43:20.682

43:18.096 --> 43:20.682
"Marilyn, are you all right?"

43:20.723 --> 43:22.309
And she looked at me, she goes,

43:22.351 --> 43:25.562
"Oh, Johnnie, oh..."

43:22.351 --> 43:25.562
She says, "Oh, Johnnie." I go...

43:25.603 --> 43:28.023
I go, "What happened?"

43:25.603 --> 43:28.023
She says, "I don't know."

43:28.064 --> 43:30.984
She says, "I came and then

43:28.064 --> 43:30.984
I went somewhere."

43:31.026 --> 43:32.735
And I go, "Jesus Christ!"

43:32.777 --> 43:36.448
So now, I'm back on Broadway

43:32.777 --> 43:36.448
doing "Jesus Christ Superstar."

43:36.490 --> 43:38.492
I get a call.

43:38.534 --> 43:40.536
"How you doing? Yeah."

43:38.534 --> 43:40.536
from the Mitchell Brothers.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.454
They say, "You know

43:40.577 --> 43:42.454
you're the star of this movie."

43:42.496 --> 43:44.039
I go, "What you talking

43:42.496 --> 43:44.039
about, man?"

43:44.080 --> 43:45.957
I said, "I'm in theater,

43:44.080 --> 43:45.957
I'm doing legitimate theater.

43:45.999 --> 43:48.043

43:48.084 --> 43:49.711
They go,

43:48.084 --> 43:49.711
"Yes, you are."

43:49.752 --> 43:51.171
I go, "What are

They go, "We got a $50,000 check

44:10.732 --> 44:15.028
It made it real for society,

44:10.732 --> 44:15.028
and they went, "What?"

44:15.070 --> 44:16.446
I get off the plane, man,

44:16.488 --> 44:19.074

44:26.373 --> 44:29.209

44:29.251 --> 44:32.421
So I get the award for

44:29.251 --> 44:32.421
the best erotic film ever shot

44:32.462 --> 44:34.047
and all that stuff.

44:34.089 --> 44:37.008
And I come back home

44:34.089 --> 44:37.008
to the United States,

44:37.050 --> 44:39.386
and I figure that's it, right?

44:39.428 --> 44:41.304
I figure, "Okay,

44:39.428 --> 44:41.304
I'm finished with that."

44:41.346 --> 44:43.265
But then all

they want me

44:50.980 --> 44:53.275
That was cool.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.652
Then after that me and Marilyn

44:53.316 --> 44:55.652

44:55.693 --> 44:58.113
"Inside Marilyn Chambers,"

and her

44:58.154 --> 45:00.156
"Resurrection of Eve."

45:00.198 --> 45:03.701
Later on, when I used to go

45:00.198 --> 45:03.701
to the erotic film awards,

45:03.743 --> 45:06.121
all the brothers would see me,

45:03.743 --> 45:06.121
they'd go like this.

they wouldn't be there.

45:11.751 --> 45:13.420
I opened the door for them.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.298

down on Market Street,

Market Street

45:27.225 --> 45:30.145
in San Francisco.

45:30.186 --> 45:33.148
I was doing a reenactment

45:30.186 --> 45:33.148
of "the Green Door"

45:33.189 --> 45:35.358
for a live audience.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.903
Meanwhile, they got

45:35.400 --> 45:38.903
seven cops in the audience.

45:38.945 --> 45:40.989
And when I pull out my dick

45:38.945 --> 45:40.989
and go to do it,

45:41.030 --> 45:44.534
they all, cops just came in

45:41.030 --> 45:44.534
and busted me. Took me to jail.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.536
Of course the Mitchells got me

45:44.576 --> 45:46.536
out insto-presto.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.330
But then I went

45:46.578 --> 45:48.330
before the court.

45:48.371 --> 45:51.458
So we had to moved it up

45:48.371 --> 45:51.458
to the California Supreme Court.

45:51.500 --> 45:55.712

45:51.500 --> 45:55.712

46:00.425 --> 46:03.470

46:03.512 --> 46:06.431
So, I go before

46:03.512 --> 46:06.431
the Supreme Court.

46:06.473 --> 46:08.308
So, they call me up

46:06.473 --> 46:08.308
and they go,

46:08.350 --> 46:10.893
"Okay, Johnnie, what you

46:08.350 --> 46:10.893

46:10.935 --> 46:14.564
gray hair and their soft dicks.

46:14.606 --> 46:18.694

Which would you rather

46:30.413 --> 46:33.958

46:34.000 --> 46:38.796
Of course, they can't say.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.796
They gotta say the latter,

46:38.838 --> 46:40.882

46:40.923 --> 46:44.386
And my testimony helped change

46:44.427 --> 46:47.805
the sexual mores

46:44.427 --> 46:47.805
of this country.

46:49.307 --> 46:54.771
It made it legal for human

46:49.307 --> 46:54.771
beings to go to a store

46:54.812 --> 46:59.067
and rent

46:54.812 --> 46:59.067

46:59.108 --> 47:02.862
And I helped make that thing

46:59.108 --> 47:02.862
a reality in this country.

47:02.904 --> 47:05.657
So, I freed a lot

47:02.904 --> 47:05.657
of dicks and pussies.

47:05.699 --> 47:07.576
That's how I feel

47:05.699 --> 47:07.576
about it. Know what I mean?

47:07.617 --> 47:10.078
Real talk. That's real talk.

47:13.289 --> 47:17.919

One night,

47:25.719 --> 47:30.181
the lead singer in the show

47:25.719 --> 47:30.181
had laryngitis.

47:30.223 --> 47:32.267

49:35.973 --> 49:39.686
and how it can develop.

49:39.728 --> 49:41.521
and I'm really into, like,

49:41.563 --> 49:44.315
pushing the boundaries

49:41.563 --> 49:44.315
of future porn,

49:44.357 --> 49:46.526
of, like, I don't know,

49:44.357 --> 49:46.526
technologies and stuff.

49:46.568 --> 49:48.236
I'm really into, like,

49:46.568 --> 49:48.236
virtual reality porn

49:48.277 --> 49:49.821
and stuff like that

49:48.277 --> 49:49.821
at the moment.

49:49.863 --> 49:51.489
So, yeah, I'm happy

49:49.863 --> 49:51.489
with what I'm doing,

49:51.531 --> 49:54.200
but eventually I want

49:51.531 --> 49:54.200
to direct and produce films.

49:54.242 --> 49:55.911
And basically

49:54.242 --> 49:55.911
push the boundaries

49:55.952 --> 49:58.621
of what's out there at

49:55.952 --> 49:58.621
the moment technology-wise.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.165
You know? I'm doing a bit with

49:58.663 --> 50:01.165
360 video work at the moment,

50:01.207 --> 50:02.751
just testing and stuff.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.711
And hopefully, I think,

50:02.792 --> 50:04.711
that's got a lot of prospect.

50:04.753 --> 50:07.714
But, yeah, porn's

50:04.753 --> 50:07.714
one of them worlds, man.

50:07.756 --> 50:10.049
It's ever-evolving

50:07.756 --> 50:10.049
and, you know,

50:10.091 --> 50:11.593
all the new technologies

50:10.091 --> 50:11.593
are always found,

50:11.634 --> 50:13.595
and some come and some go.

50:13.636 --> 50:15.764
And I'm just grateful

50:13.636 --> 50:15.764
to be where I am

50:15.805 --> 50:18.391
and kind of progressing

50:15.805 --> 50:18.391
with it, you know what I mean?

50:18.433 --> 50:21.394
So, hopefully one day,

50:18.433 --> 50:21.394
I'll be able to direct

50:18.433 --> 50:21.394
and produce films

50:21.436 --> 50:23.980
and find another

50:21.436 --> 50:23.980
big dick kid like me

50:21.436 --> 50:23.980
and change his life, man.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.190
That's all I want to do.

50:27.316 --> 50:30.695
[electronic music playing]

50:49.380 --> 50:51.674
[Brittany Andrews]

50:49.380 --> 50:51.674
What's the difference between

50:49.380 --> 50:51.674
a boy toy, a slave,

50:51.716 --> 50:54.427
and a fuck buddy

50:51.716 --> 50:54.427
and a boyfriend?

50:54.469 --> 50:57.430
I've actually had

50:54.469 --> 50:57.430
to try to explain this

50:54.469 --> 50:57.430
to my shrinks before.

50:57.472 --> 50:59.140
[laughs]

50:59.181 --> 51:02.393
Slave boys, they enjoy

50:59.181 --> 51:02.393
the fetter side of things.

51:02.435 --> 51:07.189
Fuck buddies are people that

51:02.435 --> 51:07.189
would be boyfriends

51:07.231 --> 51:08.858
if they were better.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.318
[laughs]

51:10.359 --> 51:12.695
And then boyfriends are people

51:10.359 --> 51:12.695
that you have,

51:12.737 --> 51:17.867
you know, spiritual, sexual,

51:12.737 --> 51:17.867
emotional relationships with,

51:17.909 --> 51:20.202
and, you know, you're

51:17.909 --> 51:20.202
intimate and vulnerable,

51:20.244 --> 51:21.913
and all of that

51:20.244 --> 51:21.913
kind of fun stuff.

51:21.955 --> 51:23.957
And the boy toys are just

51:21.955 --> 51:23.957
supposed to shut the fuck up,

51:23.999 --> 51:26.626
be cute and pretty and do

51:23.999 --> 51:26.626
as mistress mommy tells them to.

51:33.424 --> 51:40.056
I always wanted a smooth-running

51:33.424 --> 51:40.056
machine of a business,

51:40.097 --> 51:41.599
like that was

51:40.097 --> 51:41.599
always my goal.

51:41.641 --> 51:43.434
I remember, like,

51:41.641 --> 51:43.434
asking people, like,

51:43.476 --> 51:45.436
"How do you get into porn?

51:43.476 --> 51:45.436
How do you get into porn?"

51:45.478 --> 51:48.773
And then I ended up

51:45.478 --> 51:48.773
doing a photo shoot

51:48.815 --> 51:51.818
with High Society

51:48.815 --> 51:51.818
and Cherry Magazine in Jamaica.

51:51.860 --> 51:54.988
And who was my roommate?

51:51.860 --> 51:54.988
Jenna Jameson was.

51:55.030 --> 51:58.074
So, she's like,

51:55.030 --> 51:58.074
"You need to move to LA

51:55.030 --> 51:58.074
and live with me,

51:58.115 --> 51:59.659
and I'll hook you up."

51:59.701 --> 52:02.161
And, you know, I was taking

51:59.701 --> 52:02.161
care of my mother at that time.

52:02.203 --> 52:04.205
And I told my mom

52:02.203 --> 52:04.205
that we were

52:04.246 --> 52:06.582
gonna be moving

52:04.246 --> 52:06.582
to Hollywood, Florida.

52:06.624 --> 52:10.294
So I'm in Jamaica

52:06.624 --> 52:10.294
and I call my mom up,

52:10.336 --> 52:12.588
and I'm like, "Mom,

52:10.336 --> 52:12.588
we're moving to Hollywood!"

52:12.630 --> 52:14.966
And she's like, "Yeah, I know."

52:12.630 --> 52:14.966
I'm like, "Scratch."

52:15.008 --> 52:17.426
[laughs]

52:15.008 --> 52:17.426
"Hollywood, California."

52:17.468 --> 52:18.678
She's like, "What?"

52:18.720 --> 52:21.806
I was 23 and I decided

52:18.720 --> 52:21.806
to open up,

52:21.848 --> 52:24.517
you know,

52:21.848 --> 52:24.517
a 5,000 square-foot studio,

52:24.559 --> 52:26.185
make it a rental facility.

52:26.227 --> 52:28.270
And I started

52:26.227 --> 52:28.270
right after that

52:28.312 --> 52:30.606
my first Web site

52:28.312 --> 52:30.606
and then, you know,

52:30.648 --> 52:32.483
decided to do a whole

52:30.648 --> 52:32.483
network of them

52:32.525 --> 52:34.443
and all different

52:32.525 --> 52:34.443
kinds of fetishes.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.112
It was called

52:34.485 --> 52:36.112
"The Niche Bitch."

52:36.153 --> 52:37.864
I had the Niche Bitch network.

52:37.906 --> 52:39.323
And it went from there.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.576
Then the whole gonzo thing

52:39.365 --> 52:41.576
kind of started

52:41.617 --> 52:44.037
when you started having, like,

52:41.617 --> 52:44.037
digital cameras.

52:44.079 --> 52:46.915
And everybody else

52:44.079 --> 52:46.915
used to call it,

52:46.956 --> 52:51.544
um, the actual civilian

52:46.956 --> 52:51.544
term for it... [laughs]--

52:51.586 --> 52:53.588
"civilian" meaning you people--

52:53.629 --> 52:56.674
...um, non porn stars,

52:56.716 --> 52:58.342
uh, it was called Pro-Am.

52:58.384 --> 53:01.470
Which really all it meant was

52:58.384 --> 53:01.470
there was a bunch of idiots

53:01.512 --> 53:02.972
that used to be porn stars

53:03.014 --> 53:05.558
that had picked up a camera,

53:03.014 --> 53:05.558
myself included...

53:05.600 --> 53:07.309
[laughs]

53:07.351 --> 53:09.104
...but mostly it was all guys.

53:09.145 --> 53:12.398
Because, once again, it was

53:09.145 --> 53:12.398
a very, very

53:12.440 --> 53:15.443
boys' school business

53:12.440 --> 53:15.443
back then.

53:15.484 --> 53:19.196
I mean, it was all Italian mafia

53:15.484 --> 53:19.196
that did distribution,

53:19.238 --> 53:21.950
and it was all Jewish mafia

53:19.238 --> 53:21.950
that did production,

53:21.991 --> 53:25.870
and women were not allowed

53:21.991 --> 53:25.870
to kind of get in there,

53:25.912 --> 53:27.747
especially distribution,

53:25.912 --> 53:27.747
you know.

53:27.789 --> 53:31.793
So, but anyways,

53:27.789 --> 53:31.793
there was a film,

53:31.834 --> 53:34.087
I think it was called "Erocity,"

53:34.129 --> 53:39.550
where I was raping

53:34.129 --> 53:39.550
the fuck out of this

53:34.129 --> 53:39.550
guy's ass in my dungeon,

53:39.592 --> 53:42.637
and it was really hilarious

53:42.678 --> 53:44.680
because I broke

53:42.678 --> 53:44.680
my discipline horse.

53:44.722 --> 53:48.726
And I just kept pounding that

53:44.722 --> 53:48.726
motherfucker into the ground.

53:48.768 --> 53:51.771
And it was so funny

53:48.768 --> 53:51.771
'cause the director

53:48.768 --> 53:51.771
afterwards was like,

53:51.813 --> 53:54.649
"You didn't miss a beat."

53:51.813 --> 53:54.649
[laughs]

53:54.690 --> 53:58.694
And I'd always have, you know,

53:54.690 --> 53:58.694
these soirée affairs,

53:58.736 --> 54:02.239
and I'd have a curator with

53:58.736 --> 54:02.239
all these fetish kind of art,

54:02.281 --> 54:04.325
and I'd have these

54:02.281 --> 54:04.325
custom-made outfits,

54:04.366 --> 54:05.743
and I'd have an open bar.

54:05.785 --> 54:08.496
And then, you know, I'd be

54:05.785 --> 54:08.496
double-fisting somebody

54:08.537 --> 54:11.207
in the dungeon downstairs.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.417
And, you know, my mom

54:11.248 --> 54:13.417
would be upstairs,

54:13.459 --> 54:15.670
and she's like,

54:13.459 --> 54:15.670
"I'm so proud of my daughter."

54:15.711 --> 54:18.214
And they're like, "Do you know

54:15.711 --> 54:18.214
what she's doing downstairs?"

54:18.255 --> 54:20.008
"I don't care. I'm just

54:18.255 --> 54:20.008
very proud of her."

54:20.049 --> 54:23.719
[laughs]

54:20.049 --> 54:23.719
I know I'm hypocritical

54:23.761 --> 54:27.056
'cause I'm a dominatrix

54:23.761 --> 54:27.056
and I beat the shit

54:23.761 --> 54:27.056
out of men,

54:27.098 --> 54:30.226
but I just feel like it's

54:27.098 --> 54:30.226
appropriate doing it to a man

54:27.098 --> 54:30.226
but not a woman.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.269
Call me cray-cray,

54:30.267 --> 54:32.269
it's the feminist in me.

54:36.565 --> 54:38.776
-Sam?

54:36.565 --> 54:38.776
-Yeah?

54:38.818 --> 54:41.988
How about you come over here

54:38.818 --> 54:41.988
and sit besides me on this couch

54:42.030 --> 54:47.368
and show me some of that

54:42.030 --> 54:47.368
Sam Slate private dick?

54:47.409 --> 54:48.744
Thought you'd never ask me.

54:50.329 --> 54:52.748
[both moaning]

54:54.876 --> 54:57.003
I feel like now

54:54.876 --> 54:57.003
when I watch porn,

54:57.045 --> 54:58.713
it's like, you know,

54:57.045 --> 54:58.713
fucking her in the ass,

54:58.754 --> 55:00.256
and choking her

54:58.754 --> 55:00.256
and, you know,

55:00.297 --> 55:03.259
having as many cocks

55:00.297 --> 55:03.259
as you possibly can,

55:03.300 --> 55:06.095
and it's all this spit

55:03.300 --> 55:06.095
and put her head in the toilet.

55:06.137 --> 55:09.224
And I am not down

55:06.137 --> 55:09.224
with that program.

55:09.265 --> 55:11.893
So when I had

55:09.265 --> 55:11.893
originally retired,

55:11.934 --> 55:15.104
because all porn stars, we come

55:11.934 --> 55:15.104
back and we... [laughs]

55:15.146 --> 55:16.814
That's what we do,

55:15.146 --> 55:16.814
we leave and we come back.

55:16.856 --> 55:18.941
But when I originally retired,

55:18.983 --> 55:24.113
I had no problem doing it

55:18.983 --> 55:24.113
because the business that I knew

55:24.155 --> 55:28.659
where you actually had sex,

55:24.155 --> 55:28.659
like, on beds and desks,

55:28.701 --> 55:31.204
and, you know, and it was like,

55:28.701 --> 55:31.204
you were having sex.

55:31.246 --> 55:33.581
It was, like, good.

55:31.246 --> 55:33.581
[laughs]

55:33.622 --> 55:37.710
Now, oh my God, I need to do

55:33.622 --> 55:37.710
a sitz bath afterwards.

55:37.752 --> 55:39.795
I mean, they freaking kill you.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.965
It's like, it's all about

55:39.837 --> 55:42.965
pounding you into the next room,

55:43.007 --> 55:44.425
and choking you.

55:44.466 --> 55:46.010
They don't do

55:44.466 --> 55:46.010
that shit to me.

55:46.052 --> 55:48.345
Because I will turn around

55:46.052 --> 55:48.345
and clock the motherfucker.

55:48.387 --> 55:50.639
'Cause I am a dominant woman

55:48.387 --> 55:50.639
and I'm older.

55:50.681 --> 55:52.850
Respect your elders, beyotch.

55:52.892 --> 55:54.602
[laughs]

55:56.312 --> 55:58.773
I had been retired

55:56.312 --> 55:58.773
for quite a few years

55:58.814 --> 56:00.858
and a director

55:58.814 --> 56:00.858
contacted me,

56:00.900 --> 56:03.945
not knowing that I had

56:00.900 --> 56:03.945
been retired.

56:03.986 --> 56:06.447
And he's like, "Oh, you know,

56:03.986 --> 56:06.447
I was wondering, you know,

56:06.488 --> 56:08.407
"I had a scene that I

56:06.488 --> 56:08.407
wanted you to be in."

56:08.449 --> 56:09.992
[chuckles]

56:10.034 --> 56:12.328
And I was like, "Okay, well,

56:10.034 --> 56:12.328
what's the name of the film?"

56:12.369 --> 56:13.537
And he's like, "Golden Girls."

56:13.579 --> 56:15.248
I'm like,

56:13.579 --> 56:15.248
"You're a fucking jerkoff!"

56:21.129 --> 56:24.340
Dude calls me back, like,

56:21.129 --> 56:24.340
a year later and he goes,

56:24.381 --> 56:26.383
"I got your comeback film."

56:26.425 --> 56:29.386
I'm like, "Get the fuck

56:26.425 --> 56:29.386
outta here. [laughs]

56:29.428 --> 56:32.307
Didn't think I'd be hearing

56:29.428 --> 56:32.307
from you again," and...

56:35.310 --> 56:37.853
Do you want a piece

56:35.310 --> 56:37.853
of me, you little bitch?

56:38.896 --> 56:40.189
What?

56:40.231 --> 56:42.275
"Sex and the City,"

56:40.231 --> 56:42.275
I want you to play Samantha.

56:42.317 --> 56:44.902
I'm like,

56:42.317 --> 56:44.902
"Dude, I like you, man."

56:44.944 --> 56:48.864
So, I got to do

56:44.944 --> 56:48.864
that particular movie,

56:48.906 --> 56:51.284
and I had realized

56:48.906 --> 56:51.284
it had been a while

56:51.326 --> 56:53.328
since I'd been on camera.

56:53.369 --> 56:56.789
I had maybe done, like, two

56:53.369 --> 56:56.789
anal scenes in my entire life.

56:56.831 --> 56:58.249
So I said I would

56:56.831 --> 56:58.249
do an anal scene.

56:58.291 --> 57:00.001
But I'm not a pro at this.

57:00.042 --> 57:03.629
God bless all of the men

57:00.042 --> 57:03.629
out there that think that,

57:03.671 --> 57:06.174
you know, there's not a lot

57:03.671 --> 57:06.174
of preparation that

57:03.671 --> 57:06.174
goes into this.

57:06.215 --> 57:09.510
Let me tell you something,

57:06.215 --> 57:09.510
there... there needs to be.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.887
Oh, you dirty, naughty boy.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.765
-You wanna fuck my ass?

57:11.929 --> 57:14.765
-Yeah, I wanna fuck that ass.

57:14.807 --> 57:16.225
Oh, yeah.

57:16.267 --> 57:18.644
Shove that big cock in my ass.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.604
It's like, 10:00 a.m.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.604
and you're having, like,

57:20.646 --> 57:23.191
a 20-inch cock shoved

57:20.646 --> 57:23.191
into your ass, right?

57:23.232 --> 57:26.235
And, you know, I haven't had

57:23.232 --> 57:26.235
anything in my own booty

57:26.277 --> 57:28.279
for, like, a long time.

57:28.321 --> 57:30.614
I'm in the bathroom

57:28.321 --> 57:30.614
talking to a girlfriend of mine.

57:30.656 --> 57:32.908
"Allison, something

57:30.656 --> 57:32.908
happened to my ass."

57:32.950 --> 57:34.369
She's like, "What are

57:32.950 --> 57:34.369
you talking about?"

57:34.410 --> 57:36.037
I'm like, "There's something

57:34.410 --> 57:36.037
wrong with my ass."

57:36.078 --> 57:37.454
She's like, "What are

57:36.078 --> 57:37.454
you talking about?"

57:37.496 --> 57:39.165
I'm like, "No, there's

57:37.496 --> 57:39.165
really something, like,

57:39.207 --> 57:42.710
"like, I think my ass

57:39.207 --> 57:42.710
flipped inside out or-- Yeah."

57:42.751 --> 57:44.879
And she's like,

57:42.751 --> 57:44.879
"What are you talking--"

57:44.920 --> 57:48.090
I'm like...

57:44.920 --> 57:48.090
(whining) "Something's

57:44.920 --> 57:48.090
wrong with my ass."

57:48.132 --> 57:49.884
And so, sure enough,

57:49.925 --> 57:51.593
I go back on set, you know,

57:51.635 --> 57:54.096
and I'm like, got my legs

57:51.635 --> 57:54.096
together and I'm scooting in,

57:54.138 --> 57:56.849
and they're like,

57:54.138 --> 57:56.849
"Uh, are you okay?"

57:56.891 --> 57:58.642
And I'm like, "Um...

58:00.269 --> 58:01.854
Something happened to my ass."

58:01.896 --> 58:04.565
And they're like,

58:01.896 --> 58:04.565
"Oh, not a big deal.

58:04.606 --> 58:06.108
You're just rosebudding it."

58:06.150 --> 58:08.819
I'm like,

58:06.150 --> 58:08.819
"What is rosebudding it?"

58:08.861 --> 58:12.114
And they're like, "Well,

58:08.861 --> 58:12.114
it's when you have a prolapse,

58:12.156 --> 58:13.949
"you know, like,

58:12.156 --> 58:13.949
your ass, like, prolapsed.

58:13.991 --> 58:16.827
"It flips inside out." Right?

58:16.869 --> 58:19.580
And I'm like,

58:16.869 --> 58:19.580
"Oh, no, this is not good."

58:19.621 --> 58:21.165
They're like,

58:19.621 --> 58:21.165
"Oh, don't worry about it.

58:21.207 --> 58:23.751
"There's like a ton of girls

58:21.207 --> 58:23.751
in the industry

58:23.792 --> 58:26.087
"that have permanent rosebud.

58:26.128 --> 58:30.674
"There's like a whole prolapse

58:30.716 --> 58:35.430
And I'm like, "No..."

58:35.471 --> 58:39.141
The next time

58:35.471 --> 58:39.141
I did an anal scene,

58:35.471 --> 58:39.141
I prepared for a month.

58:39.183 --> 58:40.768
[laughs]

58:40.809 --> 58:42.603
[Man]

58:40.809 --> 58:42.603
Have you put any restrictions

58:42.644 --> 58:44.521
on what you're willing

58:42.644 --> 58:44.521
to do on video?

58:44.563 --> 58:46.690
Um, at this point

58:44.563 --> 58:46.690
in time I have.

58:46.732 --> 58:52.113
I won't do any anals

58:46.732 --> 58:52.113
or gangbangs,

58:52.154 --> 58:53.530
and that's pretty much it.

58:53.572 --> 58:55.532
And the only reason is, is...

58:55.574 --> 58:57.034
[clears throat]

58:57.076 --> 59:00.955
...it's more, like, a business

58:57.076 --> 59:00.955
thing than anything else.

59:00.996 --> 59:04.083
I figure I have to have

59:00.996 --> 59:04.083
something left

59:04.125 --> 59:06.627
when... to market

59:04.125 --> 59:06.627
a little bit later on.

59:06.668 --> 59:11.299
So, you'll probably see me

59:06.668 --> 59:11.299
doing it a little bit later,

59:06.668 --> 59:11.299
but not quite yet.

59:11.340 --> 59:12.967
Gonna make you wait for it.

59:13.008 --> 59:14.385
[Man]

59:13.008 --> 59:14.385
Do you do it off camera?

59:14.427 --> 59:16.929
Oh, definitely. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

59:14.427 --> 59:16.929
Mm-hmm. Definitely.

59:16.971 --> 59:18.473
Well, I don't know

59:16.971 --> 59:18.473
about gangbangs.

59:18.514 --> 59:21.016
I don't really usually get into

59:18.514 --> 59:21.016
a gangbang situation

59:21.058 --> 59:22.435
all that often.

59:22.477 --> 59:24.520
Um, but anal sex,

59:24.561 --> 59:28.023
I do try get it in

59:24.561 --> 59:28.023
every once in a blue moon.

59:28.065 --> 59:29.566
[laughs]

59:29.608 --> 59:32.403
[Andrews]

59:29.608 --> 59:32.403
I'd been producing

59:29.608 --> 59:32.403
and directing for 15 years,

59:32.445 --> 59:34.363
and I thought,

59:32.445 --> 59:34.363
"Well, you know what?

59:34.405 --> 59:36.532
"Why don't I understand

59:34.405 --> 59:36.532
the theory

59:36.573 --> 59:39.868
"of what I've actually been

59:36.573 --> 59:39.868
doing for the last 15 years."

59:39.910 --> 59:42.330
So I moved to New York

59:42.371 --> 59:46.667
and I started going to

59:42.371 --> 59:46.667
the New York Film Academy.

59:46.708 --> 59:50.796
I did two years of producing,

59:46.708 --> 59:50.796
one year of directing.

59:50.838 --> 59:53.549
It was funny 'cause they would

59:50.838 --> 59:53.549
go on my IMDB page

59:53.590 --> 59:57.636
and, you know, there's these

59:53.590 --> 59:57.636
19-year-old film school boys,

59:57.678 --> 01:00:00.722
and they're like, "Oh my God!

59:57.678 --> 01:00:00.722
You have 1,000 credits?"

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.016
[laughs]

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.561
"Your IMDB page is so big

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.561
and massive and huge.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.563
"Wow!" You know.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.525
So yeah, when I realized that

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.525
independent filmmaking was

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.525
not going to continue

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:14.278
making me the rich bitch

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:14.278
that I'm used to being...

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:14.278
[laughs]

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.281
[electronic music playing]

01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:19.033
Maybe I should DJ?

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.035
Workaholic slash

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.035
rave chick girl.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.620
Work my ass off, work hard,

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.620
play hard kind of thing.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.502
I was always billed out

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.502
as the porn star DJ.

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:31.170
But then I've also been

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:31.170
in "Playboy" magazine,

01:00:31.212 --> 01:00:33.255
so also "Playboy" DJ.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:39.512
And, you know, now I get

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:39.512
to just be a talented

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:39.512
scam artist DJ.

01:00:39.554 --> 01:00:45.934
I've not had any issue

01:00:39.554 --> 01:00:45.934
with my past being negative.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.811
It's actually been

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.811
the exact opposite.

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.939
I've utilized all

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.939
the tools and connections

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.358
and things like that

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.528
in whatever new businesses

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.528
that I start now.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.779
I am very happy that I was

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.575
a part of

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.575
the "golden age of porn."

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:03.202
Very happy.

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:03.202
'Cause, you know what?

01:01:03.244 --> 01:01:05.079
I don't know if I

01:01:03.244 --> 01:01:05.079
could do it nowadays.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.457
I really don't know

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.457
if I could.

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:15.548

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:22.846
[Man]

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:22.846
Most men involved

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:22.846
in the industry,

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.224
outside of most of the talent,

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:27.476
I don't think

01:01:25.266 --> 01:01:27.476
they're pro-women.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.894
I don't think they like women.

01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:33.857
I think that they get off on

01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:33.857
having power over women.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.568
But it also creates money,

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.070
so, you know,

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.070
that's my opinion.

01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:40.573
I don't think it's...

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:44.577
It's far from the most honorable

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:44.577
industry that ever existed.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.248

to keep doing it,

01:01:57.131 --> 01:02:00.301
but, I mean, if something

01:01:57.131 --> 01:02:00.301
else comes up,

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:01.927
that'd be cool too, but...

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:04.179
I want to eventually, like,

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:04.179
hire people to do it for me,

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.682

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.682
anymore, you know what I mean?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.603
Like, have my own site

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.603
and pay girls to do stuff.

01:02:10.645 --> 01:02:12.605
Or men.

01:02:10.645 --> 01:02:12.605
So that I don't have to, like--

01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:14.315
I can be, like,

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.471
[Man]

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.471
Are there certain aspects

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:48.098
of this kind of work

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:48.098
that you dislike?

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.934
Yeah, but the likes

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.934
outweigh the dislikes.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.944
[Man]

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.944
What's going on in the life

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.944
of Chasey Lain?

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.489
[Lain]

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.489
Right now I'm out here working.

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.073
I do two weeks on,

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.073
two weeks off.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.410
And I'm giving some love to

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.410
Dennis here at the BunnyRanch.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:09.911
There it is.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.706
And a lot of love

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.706
to a lot of fans out there?

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:16.168
Yeah. Anybody can come,

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:16.168
swing on by and we'll have

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:16.168
a good time.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.753
There you go.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.753
So, are you--

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.005
Are you still doing movies

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.005
or are you done with that?

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.674
[Chasey]

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.674
Mmm, I don't know

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.674
if I'm done with it.

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:22.966
I'm not shooting right now.

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.009
[Man]

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.009
Okay.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:39.400
[Lain] Off and on,

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:39.400
I went to the BunnyRanch

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:39.400
for a minute and worked.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.860
I don't have

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.860
any problem with Dennis.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:44.821
It's just that it's not for me,

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:47.199
'cause it's really

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:47.199
way far out of town,

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:50.661
and I don't like

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:50.661
the money split there.

01:03:50.703 --> 01:03:52.538
They take half of everything

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.873
and then charge you

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.873
for room and board

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:57.418
and different stuff as well.

01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:02.631
And it gets real slow

01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:02.631
during Christmas

01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:05.259
'cause it gets real cold there

01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:05.259
and it snows and stuff.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.513
So sometimes there would be

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.513
days, two, three, four days

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:12.015
and not one person

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:12.015
would walk in the door.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:16.311
So you end up having

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:16.311
to stay a little bit longer

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:16.311
than you would have

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.564
'cause you're upside down

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.564
to the house.

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:21.942
'Cause every day

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:21.942
that you're there,

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:21.942
they charge you room and board

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.611
and this and that.

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:27.531
The adult business

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:27.531
and the escort business

01:04:27.573 --> 01:04:28.949
are two separate businesses.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:30.492
They want nothing

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:30.492
to do with each other.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:33.203
In fact, years back,

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:33.203
if you were escorting,

01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:35.956
you were blackballed

01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:35.956
in the adult industry.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.958
They would never

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.958
hire you again on set

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.627
if they found out

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.627
you were escorting.

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:42.546
You're supposed

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:42.546
to be untouchable

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:42.546
when you're doing film.

01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:45.132
And so that means not

01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:45.132
everybody can get to you

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:47.008
to shoot you or...

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.470
not everybody could get

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.470
to you to have sex with you.

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:52.931
Otherwise, why would you

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:52.931
buy the video?

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:55.058
The video has to be the only

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:55.058
place they can get it

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.310
or it won't sell.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.815
My free time,

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.815
I like to spend shopping.

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:01.940
[giggles]

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:07.446
With my son.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:07.446
Or, um...

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:09.824
Relaxing. I like my horses

01:05:09.865 --> 01:05:11.325
and, you know.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.910
[Man]

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.910
Are you a clothes girl?

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.910
Or are you a shoes girl?

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:15.788
I'm shoes. I'm shoes.

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.623
-You have a big collection?

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.623
-I'm a shoes girl.

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:18.874
I do.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:22.503
Huge. 800 or so pair.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.839
Any particular brand

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.839
in particular?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.632
Not in particular.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:29.635
It's every brand. Every pair.

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:34.264
My contracts

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:34.264
progressively got better

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:34.264
throughout the years.

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:37.100
Dancing progressively

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:37.100
got better too.

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:41.021
I got a base pay and then

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:41.021
I got two rooms and two tickets.

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.858
'Cause I didn't share a room

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.858
with my roadie.

01:05:43.899 --> 01:05:47.235
And I don't take a split

01:05:43.899 --> 01:05:47.235
on merchandise either.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.864
Some of the clubs want to take,

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.864
like, half your money.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.450
Yeah, I had my own toy line,

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:55.118
and I had my own line

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:55.118
of realistics,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.121
vibrators, and love gels, so.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:01.458
They molded my hands,

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:01.458
my face, my crotch,

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.919
my feet...

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.962
my whole body,

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.962
I guess.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:11.343
There were 25 products

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:11.343
out on the market.

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:15.222
I would get checks

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:15.222
every two, three months

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:18.016
for like, 60,000

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:20.185
and stuff like that.

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:24.439
I'm old school.

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:24.439
You absolutely know

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:24.439
that gonzo's not my favorite.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.359
It's something

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.359
with a script

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.359
and a plot.

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.695
[Man]

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.695
But see, most people

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.695
would be surprised

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.739
that'd you want

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.739
to have a script and...

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.867
It's so much easier

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.867
to go by a script,

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:37.077
and you're going to work

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:37.077
to pretend to do something,

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.370
to be something, to do.

01:06:38.412 --> 01:06:41.122
I mean, it's an entire act,

01:06:38.412 --> 01:06:41.122
so why not?

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.208
I mean, yeah, of course

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.208
I'd like to have a script,

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.961
something to actually do,

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.961
work on.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.506
Not just... plop up

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.506
camera there.

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:52.300
That takes all the mad

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:52.300
movie magic out of it.

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.387
Yeah, the Internet wasn't around

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:58.223
when I first got

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:58.223
into the business,

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:02.436
and then it destroyed

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:02.436
the business pretty much.

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:05.898
People can just

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:05.898
look at the Internet and get

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:05.898
whatever they want for free.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.234
There's no need to put

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.234
any kind of production value

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.234
into anything.

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:11.737
There's no need to pay

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:11.737
an extra penny for anything

01:07:11.779 --> 01:07:16.324
when it's being shoved

01:07:11.779 --> 01:07:16.324
down your throat for free.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.828
The same opportunities

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.828
are not available now

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.747
that were then.

01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:23.624
I produced

01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:23.624
an all-girls line

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.500
for Vivid

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.500
called "Chasin' Pink"

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.962
and my budgets were $30,000.

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:31.632
I mean, that was

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:31.632
considered gonzo.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:34.885
My "gonzo,"

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:34.885
my $30,000 "gonzo."

01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:36.303
[laughs]

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.764
I mean, have you seen

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.764
the stuff that's up there?

01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:41.809
I mean, I uh...

01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:41.809
Last time I checked,

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:46.647
Bang Brothers didn't have

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:46.647
a whole elaborate setup.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.816
It's different now.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.816
I mean, they shoot something

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.901
in their living room

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.901
and throw it on the Internet

01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:52.360
and then now

01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:52.360
they're a porn star.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.613
Well, it's not really

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.613
paying your dues.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:57.157
But okay.

01:07:58.492 --> 01:08:00.953
What would you like to do

01:07:58.492 --> 01:08:00.953
after adult films?

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.832
Is there life

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.832
after adult films?

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:07.125
[laughs]

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:07.125
I don't know.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:09.294
I don't think so, but...

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:13.089
Right. Um, next question.

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:16.091
How would you judge

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:16.091
the future of porn in general?

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:22.349
I think the future of porn...

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:28.270
Well, my Lord, it's the oldest

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:28.270
profession that there is,

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:31.066
so I pretty much think

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:31.066
it's just gonna get better.

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:35.737
Yeah, it would take money

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:35.737
to do another scene.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:39.198
I mean, the companies now

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:39.198
just aren't really paying.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.118
If I wanted to shoot

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.118
every day, I could.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.830
I'm just not interested

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.830
in shooting every day

01:08:44.872 --> 01:08:50.919
because I don't really like

01:08:44.872 --> 01:08:50.919
to do interracial scenes

01:08:44.872 --> 01:08:50.919
too much.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.880
I don't want to shoot anal.

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:55.631
And so, that's mostly

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:55.631
what they're shooting

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:57.384
and I'm just not interested

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:57.384
in shooting that.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:59.970
And so, I don't.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:04.140
I mean, I've done adult

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:04.140
for a long, long time.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:07.853
I mean, there's other things

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:07.853
that can be done

01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:09.770
that I'm also interested in

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.273
that I would like to do

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.027
since the adult business

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.027
doesn't exist anymore.

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:17.278
Since... Let it go to bed.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.697
-It's for you.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.697
-Oh!

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.242
-Hello?

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.242
-Allison?

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:23.827
[Lain]

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:23.827
Fame is real.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.997
Fame is fun.

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:33.127
I made it so I'd get recognized

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:33.127
when I go to the grocery store.

01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:40.218
Everybody's your

01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:40.218
best friend when...

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.636
[laughs]

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.013
...when you're a star.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.144
A person who is paid for sex

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:53.064
doesn't necessarily have

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:53.064
any negative repercussions

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:53.064
from that act.

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.901
And some of the things

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.901
people have investigated,

01:09:55.943 --> 01:09:58.737
for example, are things like

01:09:55.943 --> 01:09:58.737
post-traumatic stress disorder,

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:00.321
anxiety disorders.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.075
And while they may occur more

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.075
frequently in that population,

01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:05.744
there's no evidence that

01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:05.744
their receiving sex for money

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:08.580
caused that problem for them.

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:12.333
Let's say I'm some

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:12.333
unemployed guy or something

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.629
in the middle of the country

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.629
living in a trailer park,

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.673
but I have

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.673
the ware-for-all to be able

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.673
to save $100 a week up

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.550
so that on

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.550
my birthday next year,

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:24.805
I can buy my favorite hooker

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:24.805
or porn star for an hour.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:28.934
Okay, she just fell

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:28.934
off that pedestal,

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:28.934
in my opinion.

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:32.604
And she became less valuable

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:32.604
to the industry.

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:36.191
As soon as someone

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:36.191
can have you

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.235
for a price

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.235
outside the industry,

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.571
your value to the industry

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.571
goes down.

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:46.284
However, the models use

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:46.284
our industry and our sites

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.746
and the scenes

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.746
as advertising

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:54.042
that they're still

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:54.042
an active adult film star.

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:57.045
[Sins]

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:57.045
People think that once you do

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:57.045
a porn, it's like over with,

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:58.505
but it's really not.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.133
Once you do porn, it actually

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.133
opens up a door to...

01:11:01.175 --> 01:11:03.802
I walk around,

01:11:01.175 --> 01:11:03.802
and I'm walking

01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:05.095
in the like street

01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:05.095
the other day,

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.848
and I was just crossing

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.848
the like, road.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.017
I'm crossing the road

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.017
and a guy yells out

01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:13.145
by car, "I fucking hate you,

01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:13.145
Donny Sins. You son of a bitch."

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:14.521
I'm like,

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:14.521
"Who are you?"

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.690
He's like, "I watched you

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.690
on Dogfart the other day.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.942
"You were fucking

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.942
this blonde chick that I love

01:11:18.984 --> 01:11:20.861
and I never got

01:11:18.984 --> 01:11:20.861
to fuck her before."

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.697
And you're like...

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.697
It opens up avenues for you,

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.697
you know what I mean?

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:25.949
And then it's funny enough

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:25.949
that he cursed me out

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.868
and then offered me

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.868
a fucking ride down the street.

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.161
And I'm like,

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.161
"No, I'm fine.

01:11:29.203 --> 01:11:30.912
It's a nice day.

01:11:29.203 --> 01:11:30.912
I would rather walk."

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:34.249
[beeping]

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.846
Okay, red light's on.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.846
We're recording.

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:52.517
All right.

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:54.728
I have no idea

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:54.728
if this is even working.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.938
I don't know

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.938
what the hell I'm doing.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.149
I just want to make

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.149
a tape, okay?

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:02.318
So, here's me.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.071
Hope you like it.

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:07.699
Sit back, relax, and enjoy

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:07.699
the feature presentation.

01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:08.825
Shit.

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:10.202
This thing on?

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:11.912
How the hell

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:11.912
am I gonna shut it off?

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:18.210
[Howard Stern]

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:18.210
And Tabitha, what about you?

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:18.210
You're in porno.

01:12:18.252 --> 01:12:19.878
What age did

01:12:18.252 --> 01:12:19.878
you start doing porno?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.214
[Tabitha]

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.214
I started at 25.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.214
I'm 31.

01:12:22.256 --> 01:12:24.299
-[Stern] You're 31 years old---

01:12:22.256 --> 01:12:24.299
-[Woman] 25 is a late start!

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.884
[Stern]

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.884
You're a late starter, yeah.

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.844
[Man]

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.844
The way she started,

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.844
I said, "How did you start?"

01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:29.096
She said she was

01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:29.096
a bored housewife.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:30.222
-Yes.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:30.222
-Really?

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:32.015
-You were a married woman.

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:32.015
-Yes, I was.

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.392
And you were sitting at home.

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.392
Did you watch a lot of porno

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.392
at home?

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:35.518
No, I've only seen--

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.812
I only saw half a porno

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.812
my whole life.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.273
[Tabitha]

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.273
I'd have to say

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.273
that Howard Stern

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:42.109
has been a very big part

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:42.109
of my career.

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:46.238
He helped me brand

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:46.238
Tabitha Stevens.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.990
And it's a great opportunity.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:52.702
And I have to laugh

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:52.702
because I always hear,

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:56.164
"Did you have to sleep

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:56.164
with Howard to be on

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:56.164
that many times on his show?"

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:58.292
And no, never.

01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:01.169
I've never, ever

01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:01.169
had sex with Howard Stern.

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:04.505
I've never, ever, ever had sex

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:04.505
with Howard Stern.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:07.759
Or anyone from his show,

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:12.097
unless it was

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:12.097
a Wack Pack member, okay?

01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:13.348
There you have it.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.143
The truth coming

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.143
from my mouth to your ears.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.477
[laughs]

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:27.028
I like, when

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:27.028
I'm going on a set,

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.488
I like to know

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.488
what I'm going to do.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.740
I like to know

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.740
who I'm going to do.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.951
I like to know this

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.951
on the porno set.

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:36.579
-Mm-hmm.

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:36.579
-I like to know what time

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:36.579
I'm going to be finished

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.206
and I like to be

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.206
treated with respect.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:39.833
That's all there is.

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:42.294
I mean, that's the one thing.

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:42.294
If you treat me with respect,

01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:45.339
I'll treat you

01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:45.339
with 100 times more respect.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.924
That's all it is.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.924
It's just that.

01:13:49.134 --> 01:13:51.636
In 1993, I got married.

01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:55.223
And I married a guy

01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:55.223
who was a super-cool guy.

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:57.017
Did very well for himself.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.936
I was a stripper

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.936
when I first met him,

01:13:59.978 --> 01:14:01.855
and then I quit obviously.

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:03.315
And I became a housewife.

01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:05.359
And I was very bored.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.695
The first video that I shot

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.695
was called "Rolling Thunder."

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.488
It was by Vivid Entertainment.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.282
Racquel Darrian

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.282
was on the box cover

01:14:12.324 --> 01:14:14.784
and my scene

01:14:12.324 --> 01:14:14.784
was with Bobby Vitale.

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:17.745
And it was supposed to

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:17.745
be a girl, but it ended up

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:17.745
being a boy/girl.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.497
They switched it

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.497
on my last minute.

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:22.334
So, of course I didn't tell

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:22.334
my husband at the time that.

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:25.461
But I remember--

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:25.461
this is the funniest thing--

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.089
being nervous

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.089
about my dialog.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.966
The sex I knew I could do,

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:31.509
'cause I knew I had a...

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:32.844
You know, I was

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:32.844
real good at that.

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:34.012
I kinda still am.

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:36.014
But anyway.

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:39.893
But my thing was,

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:39.893
what if I don't get

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:39.893
my lines right?

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.144
And I told them that.

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.146
And they're like,

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.146
"You're gonna be fine."

01:14:43.188 --> 01:14:45.065
After my scene was over,

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.608
well, I was on a desk.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.569
I was supposed to be

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.569
playing a secretary.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:51.112
-[Man] Imagine that.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:51.112
-With Bobby Vitale.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.322
And when I got up,

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:54.032
there were phone numbers

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:54.032
imprinted on my ass.

01:14:54.074 --> 01:14:55.242
[laughs]

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:56.617
And I couldn't figure out

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:56.617
what it was.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:57.911
Like, "Oh, my God,

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:57.911
who did this?"

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.537
But, yeah, so it was

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.537
kind of interesting.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:01.248
But then I got divorced

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:01.248
right after that.

01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:04.792
I had my mom get all

01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:04.792
my stuff out of my house,

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.586
you know, got divorced,

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:08.838
and that was it.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.798
Never looked back.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.261
I just couldn't see

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.261
myself being an extension

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.261
of somebody else's life.

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:16.179
I mean, he was successful

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:16.179
in what he did

01:15:16.221 --> 01:15:17.597
and he was a great provider,

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:20.434
and again, I have nothing

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:20.434
against the guy whatsoever.

01:15:20.475 --> 01:15:22.602
But here's the thing.

01:15:20.475 --> 01:15:22.602
It's like that was his thing.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:24.562
I needed to find my thing

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.940
and it ended up

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.940
porn was my thing.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.234
I just call it

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.234
ass-fucking, myself.

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:30.985
When I got into the business,

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.863
I was told

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.863
one really important thing.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:36.366
Pace out your career.

01:15:36.408 --> 01:15:39.535
If you want any kind

01:15:36.408 --> 01:15:39.535
of longevity,

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:41.788
don't do anal scenes

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:41.788
right away.

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.415
Give it a couple of years.

01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:45.792
Don't do

01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:45.792
a double penetration

01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:45.792
right away.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.585
Wait for interracial.

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:48.836
That was a big thing.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.380
Okay, well,

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.380
I didn't know.

01:15:50.422 --> 01:15:51.672
Here I come

01:15:50.422 --> 01:15:51.672
into a business.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.425
I didn't know anybody

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.425
in the porn business.

01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:55.135
So, I paced my career.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:57.220
It took me what,

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:57.220
about a year and a half,

01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.180
two years to do

01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.180
my first anal scene?

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.516
Think I've done eight

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.516
anal scenes my entire career.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.559
Maybe eight to ten?

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.228
Double penetration.

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:08.189
I did that...

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:08.189
three years later?

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:09.816
So, I took my time with it.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:12.444
It took me 17 years

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:12.444
before I did my first

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:12.444
interracial scene.

01:16:12.486 --> 01:16:14.654
So, I took my time

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.531
so that I wasn't burnt out

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.408
and people weren't burnt out.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.536
Are you following me again?

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:27.000
Told you to stop following me.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.293
[Man]

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.293
No, no, wait.

01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:30.920
[Stevens]

01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:30.920
I think nowadays

01:16:30.962 --> 01:16:34.257
that the day

01:16:30.962 --> 01:16:34.257
of the contract is over.

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:35.967
And that was

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:35.967
a big deal for us.

01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:37.385
That was a totally big deal

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:40.596
because you use that contract

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:40.596
to get on box covers.

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:41.889
You needed those box covers

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.224
so you could go

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.224
on the road dancing.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:45.435
You made a lot of money

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:45.435
feature dancing.

01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:48.229
Now, I do know that nowadays

01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:48.229
girls still go on the road.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:51.107
What happened to being

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:51.107
in those bigger movies

01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:53.151
where you could be

01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:53.151
the only girl on the box cover?

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:56.571
Now everybody's on the box cover

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:56.571
with gaping assholes.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.614
I don't think that's attractive.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:02.160
Back then it was classier

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:02.160
than I think it is now.

01:17:02.202 --> 01:17:06.164
And I think that girls

01:17:02.202 --> 01:17:06.164
are doing things nowadays

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:07.999
that they probably

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:07.999
wouldn't really want to do,

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:11.169
like the double anals

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:11.169
or the double vag.

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.879
Because they want

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.879
to make the money

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.466
and because there's

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.466
so much competition.

01:17:16.508 --> 01:17:18.385
But the art of it

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.512
is when you're suckin' it,

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.512
you gotta twist it.

01:17:20.554 --> 01:17:22.055
You gotta twist it

01:17:20.554 --> 01:17:22.055
at the top.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.473
Remember that,

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.473
Dave, for later.

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:26.059
Twist, jerk it,

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:26.059
and twist it and lick it

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.268
and go down and up.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:28.562
But don't do it in my teeth.

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:30.688
I mean, they hurt.

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:30.688
These are really good teeth.

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:31.814
See? They're really good.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.733
We're all in the sex business.

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:35.360
And I've heard this said before.

01:17:35.402 --> 01:17:36.736
We're all hoes on this bus

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.405
when it comes to work.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:42.617
I've heard that now

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:42.617
girls are getting

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:42.617
into the porn business

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.785
so that they can

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.785
become escorts.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.329
That's what's happening now.

01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:49.332
I'm not against it.

01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:49.332
Not one bit.

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:51.376
So, that's why

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:51.376
you really don't see

01:17:51.418 --> 01:17:54.546
the age of

01:17:51.418 --> 01:17:54.546
the porn star anymore.

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:57.382
I think that

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:57.382
there are a very few.

01:17:57.424 --> 01:18:00.468
You still have

01:17:57.424 --> 01:18:00.468
your Jessica Drakes

01:17:57.424 --> 01:18:00.468
of the world.

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.179
But you look at Jessie today,

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.179
and I mean, who else

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.179
after Jessie?

01:18:03.221 --> 01:18:04.889
I don't really know many girls

01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:07.267
that are now the porn star.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.811
And now I think

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.811
that's the way

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.811
they're doing it, is to...

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.564
And I'm not knocking the girls.

01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:15.442
Hey, if that's how they want to

01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:15.442
make their money, that's fine.

01:18:15.483 --> 01:18:17.235
Again, be safe about it.

01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:19.487
But I think they're

01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:19.487
coming in the industry

01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:19.487
to make a little name,

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:24.117
and then they go out there

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:24.117
and make probably even more

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:24.117
money being an escort.

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:30.665
So have you ever wondered

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:30.665
why I'm so at ease

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.959
with the adult business

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.836
and when you were

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.836
doing movies and whatnot?

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.506
I kind of have an idea,

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.506
but what is it?

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:41.134
Well, it's that...

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:44.178
I understand

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:44.178
the entertainment value.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.557
I understand that there's rarely

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.557
true passion involved.

01:18:47.599 --> 01:18:48.891
And that at the end of the day,

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:52.145
it's a job

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:52.145
as most jobs are.

01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:53.854
[laughing]

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.025
[Man]

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.025
Rolling.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.820
Cut.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.072
All right. I'm gonna

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.072
get a wide shot

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.072
and I'll come back there.

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:04.532
And rolling.

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.576
[Orona]

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.576
And the reality of it is,

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.576
is it's hard work.

01:19:06.618 --> 01:19:07.994
It's entertainment.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.788
I knew that you, like anybody

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.788
in the adult business

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:14.334
has to produce work.

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:16.711
When I decided

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:16.711
to hang it up,

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.797
with my career,

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.797
I'd have to say

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:23.092
it was pretty much

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:23.092
a joint decision about that.

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:24.927

looked me square

01:27:54.228 --> 01:27:56.313

a porn star,

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.995

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:29.805
being heavily tattooed

01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:34.476

and then pain pills

01:28:52.286 --> 01:28:58.042
came into play.

01:28:58.084 --> 01:29:00.961
Vicodin, absolutely

I thought I was gonna lose her.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.119

she suffered so,

01:30:15.161 --> 01:30:18.664
so deeply.

Everything I tried,

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.545

To replace Sunny...

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:32.511
was all I wanted to do,

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:32.511
was get her back

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.347
and get her

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.347
in her arms again,

01:30:34.388 --> 01:30:37.057
and we just

01:30:34.388 --> 01:30:37.057
didn't have the power.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.852

as far as power and money,

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:43.605
and, you know.

He's an unworthy father and...

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:51.446
I finally have the nerve

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:51.446
to call a suicide hotline.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.157

01:30:57.036 --> 01:31:01.207
And funny but sad,

01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:04.084
the woman picks up the phone

01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:04.084
and she says,

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:07.963
"We're really sorry,

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:07.963
but the doctor's not in."

01:31:08.005 --> 01:31:10.757

crying at this point

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:20.184
and right then and there,

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:20.184
I said, "Okay.

01:31:20.226 --> 01:31:22.936
Enough is enough.

thought I was

to looking on the Internet

make my next move.

01:33:12.796 --> 01:33:14.589
You know.

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:17.092
So far...

I don't.

I don't have it.
