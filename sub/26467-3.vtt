00:02.040 --> 00:03.520
<i>Previously on</i>
The Flash...

00:03.600 --> 00:06.160
<i>We have a kid who defied
the laws of physics</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:07.879
to hang out with her parents.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.075
Melt.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.456
<i>- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:13.616
The only time you need
your mother

00:13.640 --> 00:14.680
is when you're in trouble.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.239
My father's
death certificate.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.640
The M.E.
who signed off on it,

00:17.720 --> 00:19.313
he doesn't exist.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.936
<i>Now I know why she never
wants to leave</i>

00:20.960 --> 00:23.191
her dad's side
and never wants to be by mine.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.596
I just lost my speed.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.280
<i>Sounds like an insect.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.840
Like a cicada.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
Who's Cicada?

00:44.240 --> 00:45.594
<i>As a kid</i>

00:45.680 --> 00:47.558
<i>there was a part
of the Flash Museum</i>

00:47.640 --> 00:50.030
<i>that always scared me.</i>

00:50.640 --> 00:51.994
<i>I guess it's normal
for children</i>

00:52.080 --> 00:53.560
<i>to be afraid of monsters.</i>

00:56.560 --> 00:59.837
<i>But this monster
was different.</i>

01:01.800 --> 01:03.757
<i>No one knows where
he came from,</i>

01:03.840 --> 01:05.718
<i>how he got his powers,</i>

01:05.800 --> 01:07.280
<i>who he is.</i>

01:07.360 --> 01:09.795
<i>All that's known is his alias,</i>

01:09.920 --> 01:12.071
<i>and the last sound his
victim's hear.</i>

01:13.520 --> 01:15.830
<i>But that's not
what makes him scary.</i>

01:15.920 --> 01:18.037
What makes him scary is...

01:18.120 --> 01:20.271
you never catch him.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.355
We never catch him?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.119
Supergirl, The Legends,

01:28.200 --> 01:30.556
even The League tried,
but no one was successful.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.496
Probably 'cause he can dampen
everybody's powers

01:32.520 --> 01:35.035
with that magic friggin'
dagger.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.032
Not all superpowers
are meta-humans though.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.077
- What about...
- Green Arrow?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.839
Yeah, he tried too once,
but...

01:40.920 --> 01:43.879
So we're dealing with
a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.391
Amazing.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.153
What else do you know
about him?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.152
Just that he...

01:51.240 --> 01:52.560
he's early.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.915
What do you mean he's early?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.640
In my history,
Cicada's first victim

01:56.760 --> 01:58.558
was a meta-human named
Floyd Belkin.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.717
And he never killed Gridlock
or Block.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.280
They're completely different
victims.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.555
Because the timeline changed.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.711
Yeah,
and now they're both dead...

02:05.800 --> 02:07.280
because of me.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.919
Okay, there's no telling

02:09.000 --> 02:10.673
the ripple effect
of this change

02:10.759 --> 02:12.560
or what kind of future Nora's
gonna return to.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.040
We gotta catch this guy fast.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.874
You mean catch the guy
that future us can't catch?

02:16.960 --> 02:18.997
Right, I thought beating
The Thinker was hard.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.956
Guys, it's Joe.
CCPD needs help downtown.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.696
- Okay, I got it.
- No, I'll... I'll do it.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.000
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.096
You guys stay here
and deal with

02:27.120 --> 02:28.554
the meta serial killer.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.393
Okay, guys, look,
we've got this.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.358
Let's just canvass
some crime scenes,

02:32.440 --> 02:34.432
interview some witnesses,
and see if there's any

02:34.520 --> 02:37.877
common acquaintances
between Gridlock and Block.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.110
I have a plan.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.193
You... you've got
a plan already?

02:42.280 --> 02:44.112
I know how to fix this.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.990
Now nobody try nothing funny.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.437
This baby is solar
with a zero carbon footprint.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.398
I spent a week
in the sun charging

02:59.480 --> 03:02.234
with U, V, A, B, and C!

03:02.320 --> 03:04.118
So y'all stay put.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.080
Hey. Hey!

03:06.160 --> 03:09.073
I told you,
I brought my own bags.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.119
- Sorry.
- Apology accepted.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.960
<i>Don't forget
the other kind of greens.</i>

03:21.360 --> 03:22.919
What the hell?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.918
<i>Fear not, good citizens.</i>

03:29.000 --> 03:31.469
Elongated Man is here.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.714
Why do I feel like
you're focusing

03:36.800 --> 03:38.314
on the wrong thing?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.119
I just saved you...

03:40.240 --> 03:41.754
okay, if you're gonna...

03:41.840 --> 03:43.120
just don't post... don't post...

03:43.200 --> 03:44.429
I saw you post it.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.354
So your plan is
to contact Herr Wells?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.352
Yes, that's my plan.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.480
I know in the future you guys
never bring in a Wells

03:52.520 --> 03:53.840
to help you catch Cicada.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.475
So if you want a different
result this time...

03:56.560 --> 03:58.392
I try something new.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.759
It's a great idea.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.230
- 'Cept it's not.
- What?

04:03.320 --> 04:04.913
It's a terrible idea.
If you're looking

04:05.000 --> 04:07.515
for cooperation, trust me,
this is not your guy.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.996
He is just an asshat.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.309
That was way harsh, Cisco.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.517
- I'm sorry, I'm being harsh?
- Yes.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.000
Go ahead, call him.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.117
See if you don't get
a steaming pile of side-eye.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.600
Okay.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.871
Yah?

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
The Flash.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.233
Wait for it.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.994
- I love The Flash.
- What?

04:30.120 --> 04:33.272
Oh, you Barry Allen, yah?
With the zoom, zoom,

04:33.360 --> 04:35.795
and defy the physics laws
and gravity.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.276
Always with some style
and grace, yah.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.397
Thanks, man.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.040
Das Kinder Flash.
Child of the Flash.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.555
Obviously, you have
your father's moral fiber, yah.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.674
And your mother's smarts,
and classic beauty.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.877
- Oh, my God. Stop.
- Thank you, Herr Wells.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.872
No, don't thank him.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.633
Don't fall for this ruse.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.110
Clearly this guy
is putting on an act.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.236
He's a charlatan.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.750
But you hurt me,
stab me in the back,

05:01.840 --> 05:03.593
this guy who must be Cisco.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.558
- You know who I am.
- Hey, don't be rude.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.074
All right, look.
Hey, I'm sorry.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.600
We need your help catching

05:08.680 --> 05:11.354
a meta-human serial killer.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.033
Yeah,
I have heard of this Cicada.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.476
Of course, the message already
from Kinder Flash.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.631
Unfortunately,
I'm otherwise occupied,

05:17.720 --> 05:19.200
unable to assist you
at this time.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.680
- You can't?
<i>- Nein.</i>

05:20.760 --> 05:22.080
But, I have done one better

05:22.160 --> 05:23.514
and called someone who can.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.956
This man is a legend,
this man is

05:26.040 --> 05:29.158
the greatest detective
in all the Multiverse.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.152
So I've attached
his coordinates

05:31.240 --> 05:32.656
- if you want to look at them.
- Okay.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.797
- Yah, do you see it?
- Got 'em.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.872
- Good.
- Cisco.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.456
Cisco what?
You want me to breach him here?

05:38.480 --> 05:40.676
- Yeah.
- Hello? I just got Benihana'd.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.160
- Hurts a little bit.
- Sorry.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.976
Why don't we just breach him
here the old fashioned way?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.469
Hey, man, thank you for this.
This is great.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.836
Privilege and an honor
to help The Flash, yah,

05:48.920 --> 05:51.879
and Kinder Flash,
and Iris Flash, yah.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.235
Bye, Kinder Flash.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.959
Bye, Herr Wells.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.400
Nice guy.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.656
What are you talking about,
man?

05:57.680 --> 05:59.399
- He's awesome.
- He's not...

05:59.480 --> 06:01.073
You know what?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.640
Let's just turn on
the extrapolator

06:02.720 --> 06:04.473
and get this master detective
out here.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.354
Well...

06:20.640 --> 06:23.030
I imagined your Earth
would be colder.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.949
Harrison Sherloque Wells

06:28.040 --> 06:29.360
at your service.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.152
I'm here to catch your killer.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.837
Barry, what is he doing?

07:08.920 --> 07:10.536
I don't know.
Maybe it's some kind

07:10.560 --> 07:12.313
- of CSI kit?
<i>- Et voilÃ .</i>

07:12.400 --> 07:14.960
Shh.
Just let him...

07:15.040 --> 07:17.953
Mmm.
That's the stuff.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.355
And now we can begin.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.794
- Tea?
- That's right.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.400
We've been watching you
for 20 minutes.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.234
You're welcome.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.960
- Cannot rush excellence.
- This is a waste of time.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.555
Thank you very much for coming,
Cumberbatch.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.997
I'm sure you would like it
if I took my leave, right?

07:33.080 --> 07:35.993
Could have more time to recover
from your recent heartbreak.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.639
What are you talking about?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.552
Subcutaneous
under-eye bruising,

07:39.640 --> 07:41.916
which indicates
you've been crying.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.992
Flaky skin,
which indicates dehydration,

07:44.080 --> 07:46.390
probably from
alcohol consumption.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.439
Alcohol plus crying
can only mean one thing.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.318
You have been dumped.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.595
Wrong, detective.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.751
- I have not been dumped.
- Oh, no?

07:54.840 --> 07:57.674
It was a mutual decision,
okay?

07:57.760 --> 07:59.960
Cynthia and I, we reached
a decision together as a team.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.440
Sure.
Of course.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.318
Okay, and I haven't been
sobbing.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.518
In fact, I can't remember
the last time I cried about it.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.398
Excuse me.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.911
You are the resident speedster,
I presume?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.320
How did you...
Who favors stopping

08:14.400 --> 08:15.720
on his right heel?

08:15.800 --> 08:18.395
Can tell from the wear and tear
on your footwear.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.598
It's uneven.
A trait that you have inherited

08:21.680 --> 08:23.399
from your father.
Although you do share

08:23.520 --> 08:25.056
a little bit more body language
with your mother,

08:25.080 --> 08:26.639
who's been touching
her left shoulder

08:26.720 --> 08:28.840
since I came around here.
What are you hiding from me?

08:28.920 --> 08:30.070
Excuse me?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.719
I am not hiding anything.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.871
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Yes, you are, but what?

08:33.960 --> 08:36.998
You have touched it, like...

08:37.080 --> 08:38.753
it's something there,
then gone again,

08:38.840 --> 08:40.876
something removed.
A tattoo, right?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.429
Yes, perhaps from
a former lover?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.920
Okay!
You know what?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.437
I think that this Sherloque
has proven himself

08:48.520 --> 08:51.558
and that we should start
finding Cicada.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.109
Excellent.
Let's find Cicada.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.760
But first,
the question of my fee.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.990
You're charging us?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.549
This service is not free,
right?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.279
I don't work for charity.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.919
Can already tell
the young doctor here

09:04.000 --> 09:06.276
is expecting to hire me
for another case.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.714
I saw you glance at your purse,

09:07.800 --> 09:09.256
and I'm happy to assist you
in that mystery.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.158
But first,
I think we can all agree

09:11.240 --> 09:15.280
that a villain
of Cicada's caliber...

09:15.360 --> 09:18.239
will require a substantial fee.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.913
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.232
Shrap, that's a lot of money
even from when I'm from.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.993
I'm very expensive,
but very worth it.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.719
What do you think?

09:27.680 --> 09:30.639
I mean, we could sell off
some of S.T.A.R. Labs stock.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.191
- Yes! We have an agreement.
- Yeah.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.033
Do you hear that?

09:36.120 --> 09:38.430
Sounds of these frantic steps,
we're being approached

09:38.520 --> 09:41.752
either by a tall,
sensitive man, or...

09:41.840 --> 09:43.479
a frightened baby giraffe.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.911
I got... I got a problem here,
guys, and I...

09:47.000 --> 09:48.120
- Hey.
- Hello, baby giraffe.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.197
Harry, how are you?

09:50.280 --> 09:52.556
This is Sherloque Wells.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.600
Loque.
Sherloque. "L-O-Q-U-E."

09:56.680 --> 09:58.876
Sherloque.
I'm French.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.456
- "Sher-lowk" here is...
- Loque.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.120
Is gonna help us find Cicada.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.669
Oh, cool,
so you're like a detective.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.116
Oh, detective, the fans.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.271
Who should I make
the autograph out to?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.999
Little baby giraffe.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.037
Uh, no, no, no.
I'm... I'm... listen.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.440
I'm a detective as well.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.796
Yeah. Yeah.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.954
Ah, well...

10:22.040 --> 10:23.560
That's right, well,
you're a detective.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.472
What... what have you solved
recently?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.796
Most recently?
I uncovered the case

10:27.880 --> 10:29.553
of the stolen Chevy.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.834
Of Impala.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.718
Funny.
Hmm.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.110
Very funny
from the looks of things.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.240
- Whoa.
- Okay,

10:39.320 --> 10:40.515
so I saved all these hostages

10:40.600 --> 10:42.831
and... and all anybody can talk
about is this picture,

10:42.920 --> 10:45.799
and it turned into a meme.
And... and... it's...

10:45.880 --> 10:48.190
this is... I just... I don't think
anybody in this city

10:48.280 --> 10:49.873
takes me seriously.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.231
Oh, there's 14 million people
in this city.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.360
Only 500,000
have reposted this.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.238
Yeah.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.233
So, uh... Cicada?

11:01.320 --> 11:02.390
Cicada, yes.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.994
I've reviewed your evidence

11:04.080 --> 11:05.719
and I know
where to find your killer.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.156
So, shall we? Let's get this
done before dinner, right?

11:08.240 --> 11:09.594
All right, <i>allons-y.</i>

11:09.680 --> 11:11.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.520
Not so fast, baby giraffe.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.479
Two detectives
only complicates matters.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.075
Especially when only one
is a master.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.117
So why don't you stay put?

11:21.240 --> 11:24.517
You can... bite the leaves.
Everyone else, come with me.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.959
You okay?
Hmm?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.474
Oh, yeah.
I'm...

11:32.560 --> 11:34.358
Yeah, I'm... I'm great.
I just got shut down

11:34.440 --> 11:36.671
by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.433
You know Cicada's
not the only mystery

11:38.520 --> 11:39.954
around here that needs solving.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.193
Yeah.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.437
<i>Mom, I know it sounds crazy,</i>

11:46.520 --> 11:50.719
but we think someone forged
Dad's death certificate.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.837
Have you any proof?

11:52.920 --> 11:56.834
No, well, yes, sort of.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.798
It's complicated, but

11:58.880 --> 12:01.156
I just thought you should know.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.038
- Unless I already knew.
- I didn't say that.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.560
It's why you're here,
isn't it?

12:07.640 --> 12:09.199
If this is some elaborate,

12:09.280 --> 12:10.760
possibly nefarious cover-up,

12:10.840 --> 12:12.160
it must be Mom's doing.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.390
It's not like she's ever

12:13.480 --> 12:14.800
had your best interests
at heart.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.957
You always do this.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.216
<i>I just want to know the truth.</i>

12:18.240 --> 12:20.471
I think I deserve to know that.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.199
Is...

12:22.280 --> 12:23.396
my dad even really...

12:23.480 --> 12:25.199
Caitlin, your father is dead.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.078
And if you care about
my feelings at all,

12:27.160 --> 12:29.959
you'll just let this be.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.631
Thanks, mom.
Pleasure as always.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.837
Don't become obsessed
with the past.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.311
Your father had that flaw.
It nearly led to his ruin

12:41.400 --> 12:43.119
even before his death.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.197
I trust you know the way out.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.238
I'm sorry we came

12:53.320 --> 12:54.800
all this way for no reason.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.191
No, I'm impressed.
Your mom is a really good liar.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.511
Yeah, I know she forged
this death certificate.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.434
I just...
She's never gonna tell us why.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.113
We've hit a brick wall.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.793
Ah, but where you see a wall

13:06.880 --> 13:10.430
this detective sees
a brick door with no handle.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.070
What I mean is I know exactly
how to get what we came for.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.056
- You sure he's in there?
<i>- I'm certain.</i>

13:24.080 --> 13:26.436
Now, your evidence,
while slight,

13:26.520 --> 13:28.671
was enough to build
a psychological profile.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.956
This is a man hiding
in the shadows.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.151
<i>This is someone
who's been pushed</i>

13:33.240 --> 13:35.118
<i>to the peripheries of society,</i>

13:35.200 --> 13:37.157
and then now he sits alone

13:37.240 --> 13:39.436
<i>waiting for the moment
to strike.</i>

13:39.520 --> 13:42.080
All this,
plus the census data

13:42.160 --> 13:45.073
cross-referenced with
the location of his attacks,

13:45.160 --> 13:48.949
and the profile narrows
to one name...

13:49.040 --> 13:51.032
David Hersch.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.554
Nora's plan might
actually work.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.359
Or it will work.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.519
Once inside, you should find
a small booby trap.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.920
I found it.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.798
I'm on it.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.519
<i>Here is the critical part.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:12.159
It's a decoy.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.310
Sorry.
I got caught off-guard.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.675
Not so tough without
your dagger, huh?

14:45.880 --> 14:47.314
We got him.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.834
<i>That's ridiculous!</i>

15:15.920 --> 15:18.435
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

15:18.560 --> 15:20.153
<i>You don't got anything on me!</i>

15:20.240 --> 15:22.232
- Well, he sounds angry.
- Yeah.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.039
Forensics examined
Hersch's hideout

15:24.120 --> 15:25.480
and they found evidence
linking him

15:25.560 --> 15:27.119
to several anti-government
bombings.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.998
He's been doing it for a while.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.958
- So we got him.
- I don't know.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.997
They didn't find
any sign of his dagger

15:33.080 --> 15:34.080
or his mask.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.556
Dad, one CSI to another,

15:36.640 --> 15:38.632
look at the facts, okay?

15:38.720 --> 15:41.792
Sherloque is the best detective
in the Multiverse.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.473
His profile led us
to David Hersch,

15:43.560 --> 15:44.896
and we found evidence
that David Hersch

15:44.920 --> 15:46.115
is a mass murderer.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.590
What are the chances
that this isn't our guy?

15:48.680 --> 15:51.036
- I mean, maybe.
- Come on, we should celebrate.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.376
Okay, I'm gonna gather
everyone up,

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
mix some drinks,

15:53.480 --> 15:54.720
and we can have our first party

15:54.800 --> 15:56.256
- in the new lounge.
- I don't know, Nora.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.714
I...

16:00.960 --> 16:03.873
Detective Joseph West.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.030
What do you want?

16:05.120 --> 16:08.670
To finish what I started.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.070
The meta-human called Vibe.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.073
Call him here now.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.873
I can't.
I don't even know him.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.998
You were saying?

16:24.080 --> 16:27.869
Yes, I mean, he helps CCPD,

16:27.960 --> 16:30.953
but it's not like I have
a Vibe phone

16:31.040 --> 16:32.759
so I can just call him up.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.991
He's just a masked do-gooder

16:35.080 --> 16:36.719
that shows up at crime scenes.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.995
This could be a crime scene.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.638
<i>When you said you had
a plan, Ralph,</i>

16:50.720 --> 16:52.056
I didn't think you meant
breaking and entering

16:52.080 --> 16:54.959
into my mother's company
files.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.880
Reinforced steel.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.429
It's times like this
I really miss Killer Frost.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.113
Oh, don't you worry.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.316
Ralphie's got it.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.595
Okay.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.672
Yep.
Almost there.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.031
Hang on.
Yeah, almost got it.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.792
Oh, my God.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.394
- What is it?
- Lasers.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.550
Room's filled with lasers!

17:21.640 --> 17:23.551
Holy snakies.
Oh, my God.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.920
It's like
a Rubik's Cube of pain.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.229
I don't know the code.

17:26.319 --> 17:27.753
Try something

17:27.839 --> 17:29.160
that your mother would...

17:29.200 --> 17:31.112
Caitlin!
There's gotta be something.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.429
Got it.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.874
You okay?

17:35.960 --> 17:38.395
Nothing a gallon of Aloe
won't fix.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.516
Ooh.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.636
Look for the name
Thomas Snow.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.794
Jackpot.

17:54.880 --> 17:55.880
What is that?

17:55.960 --> 17:58.919
It's a game my dad
and I used to play.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.038
He would teach me
the periodic table, but...

18:02.120 --> 18:03.554
he would let me make up

18:03.640 --> 18:05.711
my own fictional compounds
and elements.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.075
Nerd-onium?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.152
He used to say it's
what made us so smart.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.751
We used to have
so much fun together.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.514
Catching bugs in the backyard,

18:17.600 --> 18:21.560
looking at constellations
through a telescope we built.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.200
He taught me so much
about science and life.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.157
Maybe he still has something
left to teach you.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.678
- What is it?
- It's a letter from my dad.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.314
Saying...

18:39.400 --> 18:40.754
goodbye.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.280
It's a suicide note.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.989
Alcohol, thank you
very much. <i>Merci.</i>

18:54.480 --> 18:55.914
- There he is.
- Hey.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.593
Dad, we're all set
to celebrate...

18:57.680 --> 18:59.034
No, hey, um.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.316
Actually, Hersch isn't Cicada.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.309
<i>What?</i>

19:03.400 --> 19:04.629
He has to be.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.189
No, I checked Cicada's
boot print from

19:07.280 --> 19:09.237
both the Block and Gridlock
crime scenes

19:09.320 --> 19:11.039
and it's three sizes larger
than Hersch's.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.120
It's not him.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.793
Well, of course it's him.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.593
It's always Hersch.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.115
Every time I capture Cicada
it's always the same man.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.112
Wait a minute,
you've caught this guy before?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.715
37 times.
I've captured 37 Cicadas,

19:22.800 --> 19:24.200
37 different Earths,

19:24.280 --> 19:25.919
and every time I try
to capture him,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.754
the trail always leads back
to that Earth's David Hersch.

19:28.840 --> 19:32.675
So this psychological profile
that you created,

19:32.760 --> 19:35.434
you just made it up?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.193
Not the first time.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.552
Now the next 36,
then I just trot it out there.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.880
You know,
to impress the client,

19:41.920 --> 19:43.639
and then...
Skip to the end.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.640
And here I thought you were just
a bad detective,

19:45.720 --> 19:47.279
but you're not a bad detective.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.953
You're just a lazy one.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.720
I'm not lazy.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.154
I'm efficient, right?

19:53.240 --> 19:54.959
- Anyway, that's not the point!
- Ow!

19:55.040 --> 19:57.635
The point's simply
that there's no reason

19:57.720 --> 20:00.110
for the Cicada of this Earth
to be anyone other

20:00.200 --> 20:02.032
than David Hersch.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.635
Well,
there may be one reason.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.675
What's that?

20:06.760 --> 20:08.160
The timeline.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.152
Yes, since Nora got here

20:10.240 --> 20:12.630
things have changed a bit.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.949
Yeah.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.997
Oh, <i>mais non,</i> you must...

20:16.080 --> 20:17.753
how can you not tell me this?

20:17.840 --> 20:19.320
How am I expected to operate

20:19.400 --> 20:21.000
when you don't give me
all the variables?

20:21.080 --> 20:22.719
I don't know,
but what we can expect

20:22.800 --> 20:24.519
is a refund, so...

20:24.600 --> 20:26.273
Yeah.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.319
Oh, no, no, no.
That money is long gone.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.616
What do you mean "it's gone"?

20:30.640 --> 20:32.552
You spent all that money
in one day?

20:32.640 --> 20:33.960
- Right.
- On what?

20:34.040 --> 20:35.440
My ex-wife-ves..

20:35.520 --> 20:38.160
Ex-wives.
Seven marriages.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.913
Five wives.
Lots of alimony.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.753
That's not the point!
The point is simply

20:41.840 --> 20:43.832
this is not my fault.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.400
It's your fault.
She is to blame.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.517
Timeline variance.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.717
Dad.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.056
You're not gonna
let Hersch off the hook

20:53.080 --> 20:54.719
because of a boot print.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.553
<i>He's a meta.</i>

20:56.640 --> 20:58.518
How do we know
what this guy can do?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.353
That's the other thing.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.736
Hersch has
no dark matter readings.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.989
He's not a meta.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.992
All right, remember.
From one CSI to another,

21:05.080 --> 21:07.640
we have to look at the facts,
right?

21:07.720 --> 21:09.120
We got the wrong guy.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.476
No, not this time.
You know what we should do?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.176
We should throw him in
the pipeline for safe keeping

21:13.200 --> 21:15.431
until he talks.
I'm gonna go get him.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.159
Hey, what are you...
no, you're not.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.074
We're not gonna kidnap
a suspect in police custody.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.496
If you don't see
what's wrong with that,

21:21.520 --> 21:23.239
you can sit this one out.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.119
Well,
guess we're back to square one

21:28.200 --> 21:30.192
with Cicada.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.350
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:31.880 --> 21:34.759
Let's hope it's not too late
to save his next victim.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.435
You have a lovely family,
Detective West.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.830
By not giving me what I want,

21:50.920 --> 21:53.230
by putting your life in danger,

21:53.320 --> 21:56.757
you're gambling
their future with you.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.560
If you knew what I know,

21:59.640 --> 22:01.472
you'd cherish them more.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.677
I'm not luring Vibe
into a death trap.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.792
You can threaten me
all you want.

22:05.880 --> 22:06.950
I'm not afraid.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.319
I believe you.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.120
But you should be.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.396
Still swirling
around up there?

22:36.840 --> 22:39.196
I just don't get Nora.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.317
I mean, I thought our training
was sinking in.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.869
She defeated Block.
She was really making progress.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.236
And next thing I know,
she wants to break into CCPD

22:46.320 --> 22:48.960
and kidnap a suspect
in police custody.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.077
I mean, it's like she wants to

22:51.160 --> 22:53.800
make Hersch Cicada.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.432
Barry, you really don't get
why she's obsessed?

22:59.680 --> 23:01.592
- Wait. Should I?
- Think about it.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.478
She's been hearing about
the ripple effects

23:03.560 --> 23:05.472
on the timeline
since she got here

23:05.560 --> 23:08.075
and at first they were
relatively small,

23:08.160 --> 23:09.594
but now...

23:09.680 --> 23:11.797
- Cicada and...
- It's not so small.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.111
He's one of the worst
serial killers in history,

23:14.200 --> 23:16.795
and now because of Nora...

23:16.880 --> 23:18.872
he's here early.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.798
And an entirely different
person.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.678
With an entirely different
set of victims.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.752
That is a huge weight
to bear for someone

23:24.880 --> 23:27.236
who just wanted to spend time
with a dad she never knew.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.830
She feels really guilty, Barry.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.754
She wants to try
to fix her mistakes,

23:33.840 --> 23:36.400
whatever that takes.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.040
Sounds like another speedster
I know, actually.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.191
Nora says there's an emergency
in the pipeline intake.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.439
Are you sure that...

23:51.520 --> 23:52.954
Sherloque.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.032
Yeah.
What happened?

23:56.400 --> 23:58.471
As far as I can tell
it looks like

23:58.560 --> 23:59.630
he was in the wrong place

23:59.720 --> 24:01.598
when this fusion cell
went critical.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.400
I think it wasn't placed
in its cradle properly.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.030
- Vaporized into ash.
- What a way to go.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.793
- Shenanigans.
- Good grife!

24:09.880 --> 24:11.758
I call shenanigans.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.116
You see,
these cells right here,

24:14.200 --> 24:16.669
they run in a redundant
cascade circuit.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.114
That's how they power
the pipeline

24:18.200 --> 24:20.795
in the first place,
so if one of them blew

24:20.880 --> 24:22.599
they all would have blown.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.751
Yeah, the whole pipeline
would have exploded.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.514
Exactly right.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.159
- Ugh.
- Mm.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.756
Darjeeling, oolong.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.513
Tea leaves.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.160
Barry, be a dear
and check the building

24:37.240 --> 24:39.118
for a weasel in a pork pie hat,

24:39.200 --> 24:41.920
about yay tall,
smells vaguely of poutine.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.472
Whoa. Tell me...

24:50.560 --> 24:52.756
who died?

24:52.840 --> 24:54.718
Found him with this.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.800
Of course you did.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.280
So you thought you could
just leave

24:57.360 --> 24:59.238
to another Earth
without paying us back?

24:59.320 --> 25:01.835
Worked on my fourth wife...

25:01.920 --> 25:03.991
and my sixth.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.753
- Same woman.
- Oh.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.910
Okay, Cisco,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.753
<i>maybe it's time to have a talk</i>

25:08.840 --> 25:10.752
about a little place called
debtor's prison.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.479
Come with me.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.791
All right.
You make me miss Herr Wells.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.916
Come with me.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.151
I'm... I'm taking you!

25:18.240 --> 25:19.913
You okay?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.071
Yeah, yeah.
It's just...

25:22.160 --> 25:24.516
for second I thought me
inviting Sherloque here

25:24.600 --> 25:27.672
got him killed,
and I just, um...

25:27.760 --> 25:30.070
at least that's one thing
that's not my fault.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.519
Hey, I wanted
to talk to you actually.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.839
I think I understand
how you're feeling.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.397
Sometimes our powers are
so extraordinary

25:43.520 --> 25:46.911
it makes our mistakes
feel amplified,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.275
especially guilt.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.357
Yeah,
but I should feel guilty.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.632
I've never messed up
this badly before,

25:53.720 --> 25:55.518
and I can't stop thinking
about it.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.432
That's just 'cause you care.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.318
<i>It's okay.
It's a good thing.</i>

25:59.400 --> 26:00.959
But...

26:05.400 --> 26:08.199
Nora, if every time
you make a mistake

26:08.280 --> 26:09.760
you just rush in to fix it

26:09.840 --> 26:12.071
you're only gonna
make things worse.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.629
Trust me,
I know that better than anyone.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.040
You just gotta have
a little more patience.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.157
Take a moment.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.596
Think before you act.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.240
Fix the problem the right way,
all right?

26:27.320 --> 26:29.232
Okay.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.038
<i>Listen, Caitlin, I'm sorry.</i>

26:35.120 --> 26:36.120
For what?

26:36.200 --> 26:39.398
For all of this.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.631
Just I-I felt like
a complete joke

26:41.720 --> 26:44.679
after that hostage thing,
and then... Sherloque shows up

26:44.760 --> 26:46.160
and everybody swoons

26:46.240 --> 26:49.119
over his so-called
"Master Detective-ness."

26:49.200 --> 26:51.396
You were nice enough
to invite me along,

26:51.480 --> 26:53.915
and I pushed you...

26:54.000 --> 26:57.038
into that, and...

26:57.120 --> 26:58.474
I'm really sorry.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.313
Ralph, this thing
you pushed me into

27:00.400 --> 27:02.631
gave me something
I've never had before.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.915
Your first felony?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.231
No.
Closure.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.832
It may not be pretty,
but I finally know the truth,

27:11.920 --> 27:14.480
and that means everything.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.233
So, for my book,

27:16.360 --> 27:18.920
you're the best detective
a girl could ask for.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.920
Hey, you never told me
what the code was

27:25.960 --> 27:28.395
on your mom's Resident Evil
laser grid of death.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.836
It was my birthday.

27:50.640 --> 27:54.190
All this
and not even a scream.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.000
You've experienced pain before,

27:57.080 --> 28:00.232
but not more than me.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.632
<i>No, Cecile, don't.</i>

28:05.720 --> 28:07.712
<i>No.
That's what he wants.</i>

28:07.800 --> 28:10.156
I didn't want to do this.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.119
Not to a family man.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.510
But I will.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.037
Time to make a decision,
Detective West.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.032
While there's still
some of you left.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.955
No, no, no!

28:40.160 --> 28:41.913
What's wrong?

28:56.760 --> 28:58.274
He took Cisco!

29:04.720 --> 29:06.576
- Cicada took Cisco.
- What do you mean took him?

29:06.600 --> 29:07.856
- Took him where?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

29:07.880 --> 29:09.656
They jumped into a breach right
when I got here.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.160
But a breach
could take them anywhere.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.800
Cisco, can you hear me?

29:13.880 --> 29:16.440
Guys, can you hear me?

29:17.521 --> 29:19.193
Cisco, where are you?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.389
I don't know.
My breach fritzed out

29:22.480 --> 29:23.994
and spat us out in
a forest somewhere.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.276
Can you breach out?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.080
It's not working.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.554
Cicada's dampening
his powers.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.336
Without a satellite
I can't pinpoint his location.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.635
I mean, in this state alone

29:43.760 --> 29:45.399
there's over
14 million acres of forest.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.976
All right, Black Forest
and Roanoke are closest.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.400
I'll start there.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.278
We're not gonna find him
in time, are we?

29:50.360 --> 29:52.591
<i>Well, before you give up,</i>

29:52.680 --> 29:54.160
- what kind of trees?
- What?

29:54.240 --> 29:56.914
In the forest,
what kind of trees, ask him.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.595
Cisco,
what kind of trees are they?

29:59.680 --> 30:02.149
I don't know!
I'm in a forest!

30:03.880 --> 30:06.111
<i>What kind of trees,
little one?</i>

30:06.240 --> 30:08.118
<i>- Pine trees, I think.</i>
- Good.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.277
Some of them have
pointy leaves.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.079
Ah, pointy...

30:12.160 --> 30:13.958
ash trees, of course.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.470
<i>All right, now I need
you to hold your breath.</i>

30:16.560 --> 30:18.358
What? Why?

30:18.440 --> 30:19.794
<i>Because I need
to hear the forest,</i>

30:19.920 --> 30:21.832
So, shh.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.234
Crickets.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.676
You hear this?
Assuming that's field crickets.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.638
They live in the soil.
Anyway, cross-reference

30:33.720 --> 30:35.712
field crickets
with a high concentration

30:35.800 --> 30:37.280
of pine trees, ash trees,

30:37.360 --> 30:38.999
in an open field,
and you have...

30:39.080 --> 30:41.640
- Kolins Woods.
<i>- On my way!</i>

31:07.240 --> 31:09.118
<i>Barry,
you got to get out of there!</i>

31:13.960 --> 31:16.077
<i>I have to help him.</i>

31:16.160 --> 31:18.038
Barry?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.437
<i>It takes time
to hone your skills, Nora.</i>

31:25.520 --> 31:27.512
<i>You can'tjust skip rungs
on the ladder</i>

31:27.600 --> 31:28.760
<i>orjump right
to the big stuff,</i>

31:28.800 --> 31:30.075
<i>that's not how it works.</i>

31:30.160 --> 31:33.278
<i>Take a moment.
Think before you act.</i>

31:33.360 --> 31:35.955
<i>Fix the problem the right way.</i>

31:37.320 --> 31:38.993
I got it.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.116
I can fix this.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.793
I've thought this through.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.195
I won't mess it up this time.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.794
I promise.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.037
I trust you.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.349
Go.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.633
All these years
in Central City

31:57.720 --> 32:00.952
spent defending metas
instead of ending them.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.192
Those days end now.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.556
Starting with you.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.399
Use this!

32:17.680 --> 32:19.751
Hey, Michael Myers,

32:19.840 --> 32:21.718
dampen this.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.552
No. No. No. No.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.478
<i>Cisco's gone.</i>

32:36.560 --> 32:37.960
Oh, my God...

33:29.520 --> 33:31.079
Cisco?

33:51.840 --> 33:53.194
He's alive.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.112
<i>He's alive.</i>

33:57.760 --> 33:58.876
Hey, man.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.915
Sorry.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.110
Your daughter.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.237
She remembered there's more
than one way to

34:10.320 --> 34:12.391
open a breach.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.708
Figured Cicada
wouldn't give up

34:13.800 --> 34:14.995
until Vibe was dead,

34:15.080 --> 34:17.914
so we gave him what he wanted.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.911
Thanks, fangirl.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.469
You saved my life.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.152
I did good?

34:24.239 --> 34:25.754
You did great.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.560
It's almost like
you're really dead.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.552
Yeah.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.989
I almost really was.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.960
How the hell are
we gonna catch this guy?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.196
Not with our powers.
We know that at least.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.634
We don't know
much else either.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.518
Variations in the timeline,
they've...

34:53.600 --> 34:55.512
shifted the elements,
complicated the equation.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.273
- Now...
- Not all those elements

34:57.360 --> 34:58.874
are bad though.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.616
You could be the new element
that saves us.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.200
You could be the reason
we catch Cicada.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.590
I must admit,
Miss Nora here pulled

35:04.680 --> 35:06.273
the rug right under
from Cicada.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.919
Oof, <i>allez hop,</i> huh?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.713
Very impressive.
Yeah, that's the only

35:09.800 --> 35:11.096
fake death we're gonna see
around here

35:11.120 --> 35:12.395
'cause you're sticking around

35:12.480 --> 35:13.880
until you pay us back
every cent.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.336
<i>Well, I have to say,
the prospect</i>

35:15.360 --> 35:16.794
of another mystery with Cicada

35:16.880 --> 35:18.234
puts a little pep in my step.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.959
Also, that breach device
you use to get

35:20.040 --> 35:21.269
in and out of places,
I suppose

35:21.360 --> 35:22.794
that's under lock and key
right now?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.096
That's at the bottom
of the ocean

35:24.120 --> 35:25.349
as far as you're concerned.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.590
Well, then I'm staying!

35:26.680 --> 35:27.816
<i>- Great!
- Course you are.</i>

35:27.840 --> 35:29.115
I'm watching you, Holmes.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.336
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Well, you'll learn a lot.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.635
- Good for you.
- Ow.

35:31.720 --> 35:32.915
All right, shall we,
sidekick.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.200
I'll sidekick your face.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.880
Something tells me
those two are gonna be

35:35.960 --> 35:38.520
just great friends.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.512
So...

35:40.600 --> 35:43.479
You guys up for
a family dinner night?

35:46.360 --> 35:47.714
Sure.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.634
Yeah.
And then maybe after

35:50.720 --> 35:53.235
we could help you
move into the loft.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.936
I know you've been kind of
cooped up here,

35:54.960 --> 35:57.555
and now that Sherloque
is gonna need a place to stay

35:57.640 --> 36:00.075
I thought you could...

36:00.160 --> 36:02.959
crash with us.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.680
I think it's a great idea,
Nora.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.315
Okay, thanks, yeah.
Thanks.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.474
Let me get my purse.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.313
- Okay.
- This will be good.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.760
I think it could be
just the thing

36:16.800 --> 36:18.678
to bring you two closer
together.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.038
I really hope so.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.154
Hey.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.594
Taking Cisco out
for some drinks

36:38.680 --> 36:40.160
in memoriam of Vibe.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.835
- You wanna come?
- I'm okay, but thank you.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.673
Anything you want
to talk about?

36:44.760 --> 36:47.912
My dad wasn't really
the letter writing type.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.176
I feel like he would have found
some other way to tell me.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.296
No luck with his work notes?

36:51.320 --> 36:52.913
No, I mean,
these molecular models

36:53.000 --> 36:54.639
are gibberish.
There's gaps everywhere

36:54.720 --> 36:57.440
and some of these compounds
don't even exist.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.159
It's like his mind
was the first to go.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.640
But, maybe I should
just listen to my mom

37:02.720 --> 37:04.712
and forget about the past.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.040
Well...

37:08.120 --> 37:09.793
You left this behind.

37:11.080 --> 37:14.039
Sometimes the past
is worth remembering.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.118
Thank you.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.949
<i>They don't exist</i>

37:34.040 --> 37:36.111
because they're not
supposed to.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.313
So this is all
I could remember

38:24.400 --> 38:25.993
about Cicada.
It's not much, but...

38:26.080 --> 38:27.520
No. No. No, this is...
this is great.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.800
I mean,
every little bit we get

38:28.840 --> 38:30.274
helps build a profile on him.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.556
I will comb over this
in the morning.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.200
You should go be
with Cecile right now.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.634
Feel better.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.589
Wait. There's...
there's one more thing.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.115
He made these comments

38:42.200 --> 38:43.350
about family

38:43.440 --> 38:44.999
and cherishing them.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.640
<i>And then the way he picked up
Jenna's blanket,</i>

38:47.760 --> 38:50.355
and I got this feeling

38:50.440 --> 38:52.750
when I looked in his eyes.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.832
What... what kind of feeling?

38:54.920 --> 38:58.038
I think Cicada's a father.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.153
Hello, Orlin.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.513
Any progress?

39:30.720 --> 39:32.712
She's not coming out of it.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.672
Let me see it.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.314
It's not healing.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.756
Doesn't matter.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.718
You can't keep doing this.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.836
You have to stop.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.832
Not until I'm finished.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.473
Oh, hi.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.880
I'm just looking for my purse.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.952
I'm about to have dinner
with my parents.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.309
It's on the chair.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.516
In the Cortex.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.478
By the mannequin.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.552
Right.
Thanks.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.393
Well, enjoy the couch.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.675
Nora.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.070
Can you help me with something?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.958
I've been wondering...

40:55.040 --> 40:57.157
You. You've traveled back
into all these

40:57.240 --> 40:59.436
great moments of your parent's
lives, right?

40:59.560 --> 41:02.359
Some wonderful, some dangerous.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.870
Most not as dangerous as...

41:04.960 --> 41:07.270
punching a falling satellite,
right?

41:07.400 --> 41:08.629
And yet...

41:08.720 --> 41:11.076
that is the moment
when you made

41:11.160 --> 41:13.880
the decision to act,

41:13.960 --> 41:16.077
altering the course
of history forever.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.112
That decision...

41:20.320 --> 41:21.913
did you come to it on your own?

41:27.360 --> 41:28.953
Of course you did!

41:29.040 --> 41:30.872
Right?
No, of course you did.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.110
You're XS!

41:32.200 --> 41:34.237
The temptation...

41:34.320 --> 41:36.152
was too much, I'm sure.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.720
It was.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.918
Well, please,

41:41.000 --> 41:42.832
forgive me.
You have a dinner to go to.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.354
Good night.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.594
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
