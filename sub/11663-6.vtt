(mellow music playing)

01:07.233 --> 01:10.000
I'm making dinner.
What would you like to eat?

01:10.066 --> 01:13.900
A thick T-bone steak, corn on the cob,
and pecan pie for dessert.

01:15.266 --> 01:16.734
Now ask me what I can chew.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.100
I'll start soaking the cornflakes now.

01:22.467 --> 01:26.266
You'll never guess
who was just on the phone.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.967
The real phone,
or your farmer-in-the-dell phone?

01:29.967 --> 01:34.166
I haven't had a Farmer in the Dell phone
since I was 50.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.700
-Who called?
-Jerry Kennedy.

01:38.767 --> 01:43.433
-Jerry Kennedy, the newscaster?
-He's coming for his daily planner.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.900
I took it home from work by mistake.

01:45.967 --> 01:49.867
Boy, was I embarrassed when I showed up
for handball with Walter Cronkite.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.767
If you ever run into Walt,

01:55.834 --> 01:58.467
don't tell him he looks like
captain kangaroo.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.467
Miami's most glamorous
anchorman's coming here?

02:02.533 --> 02:04.667
I'm going to freshen up.

02:04.734 --> 02:08.333
If his bottom half
is as good as his top half, I'm in love.

02:10.667 --> 02:14.300
The timing of Jerry's visit
works out perfectly.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.100
His birthday's in two weeks,

02:16.166 --> 02:18.867
and the office is giving him
a surprise roast.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.600
I need some things to kid him about.

02:22.667 --> 02:25.467
I can get away with it
'cause he considers me a good friend.

02:25.533 --> 02:28.667
Why not tease him about
his taste in friends?

02:28.734 --> 02:32.066
-(doorbell chimes)
-That must be Jerry now.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.934
Now remember the roast.
I really want to nail him.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.400
Keep your eyes peeled
for any oddities or quirks.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.934
Hi. It's me Stan.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.867
There's one. What do I win?

02:50.900 --> 02:52.367
Stanley, want do you want?

02:52.433 --> 02:57.100
I know you're still mad at me, but I've
got big news I thought you'd like to hear.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.300
You've misjudged me.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.000
Dorothy...

03:03.667 --> 03:05.500
I'm seeing a psychiatrist.

03:05.567 --> 03:08.533
I've discovered that the old Stan
really wasn't Stan.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.867
He was merely a Stan trying to be the Stan
everyone thought Stan should be.

03:12.934 --> 03:14.600
Hey, I've been there.

03:17.467 --> 03:20.266
But now, with some help,
I'm becoming a new Stan.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.000
Great. I'll take a <i>People</i> magazine
and a <i>Morning</i><i>Herald.</i>

03:25.133 --> 03:29.900
Ma, he is not a newsstand.
He's a new Stan.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.200
-Then you can see the change?
-I'm waiting for the change.

03:36.266 --> 03:37.900
That was a 5.

03:39.133 --> 03:43.533
Look, Stan-- old Stan, new Stan,
tastes great, less filling Stan...

03:44.300 --> 03:48.133
The point is I am not interested.
Good luck in therapy.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.567
-Dorothy, I don't think you quite get it.
-I get it perfectly.

03:51.633 --> 03:54.400
You're going to therapy
to try to win me back.

03:54.467 --> 03:59.233
You're wasting your time,
not to mention $100 an hour.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.300
110. This guy's got
the little beard and everything.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.266
Dr. Halperin's working with me
on something called closure.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.800
I'm not trying to win you back.
I'm trying to get over you.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.700
Go around her. It takes less time.

04:14.066 --> 04:17.000
He feels if you'd join me at a session,

04:17.066 --> 04:19.934
I might work through
my attachment sooner.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.200
-What do you say?
-(doorbell chimes)

04:21.266 --> 04:24.800
I'd have to give it some thought.

04:25.467 --> 04:27.734
-Jerry, hello.
-Hello, Rose.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.767
-Sorry about all this.
-No need to be sorry.

04:30.834 --> 04:33.867
I acknowledged my problem,
and I'm seeing somebody about it.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.633
Goodbye, Stan.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.233
He's our mailman.

04:41.567 --> 04:44.000
We've allowed him to get
a little too close.

04:44.734 --> 04:47.767
-Jerry, meet my friends. Dorothy.
-How do you do?

04:47.834 --> 04:52.233
-And her mother Sophia.
-Ma, you recognize our guest?

04:52.300 --> 04:53.433
Of course I do.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.533
The only man you've had in your bedroom
after 11:00 since we moved here.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.266
I'll get your planner.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.667
Watch this, Dorothy.
He won't even know I'm fishing for info.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.166
You know, Jerry, when I was a little girl,

05:08.233 --> 05:11.166
my father misplaced his daily planner,
too.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.834
We were on the way to the state fair.

05:13.900 --> 05:18.700
Speaking of state fairs,
is it true that you're cheap?

05:23.133 --> 05:26.200
Oh, my goodness. We have company.

05:31.867 --> 05:35.133
I'm just so embarrassed
to be seen in this old thing.

05:36.433 --> 05:38.734
Don't worry, Blanche.
The dress covers most of it.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.133
Jerry, meet my roommate,
Blanche Devereaux.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.867
-And, Blanche, this is--
-You don't have to tell me.

05:48.934 --> 05:53.000
"From the gulf coast to the Atlantic.
From the keys to the Okefenokee.

05:53.066 --> 05:57.166
With the 11:00 news,
this is Jerry Kennedy."

05:57.233 --> 05:58.767
Well, I'm flattered.

05:58.834 --> 06:01.700
From the pit of my stomach
to the porcelain of the bowl...

06:05.300 --> 06:08.600
There isn't an evening
I miss your broadcast.

06:08.667 --> 06:13.033
I just loved that in-depth location piece
you did on the homeless.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.633
My agent said if I hadn't
called them "bums,"

06:16.700 --> 06:18.133
I would've won a Peabody.

06:19.633 --> 06:20.633
Wow.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.567
So, Jer, uh...

06:23.033 --> 06:24.834
ever dress up like a horse?

06:29.333 --> 06:32.100
Well, not so far,
but thank you for asking.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.600
I'll just grab my day planner
and skedaddle.

06:35.667 --> 06:40.467
You don't want to skedaddle yet.
Have a drink before you go.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.934
Sorry. I never drink and skedaddle.
Besides, I have to stay sharp.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.133
I've got a handball game
with captain kangaroo.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.400
Are you suggesting another time?

06:54.467 --> 06:56.133
Just name it. I'll be there.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.066
-Well, uh--
-Tomorrow at 2:30. Empire lounge.

06:59.133 --> 07:02.433
-Why not? See you there.
-Oh, Jerry...

07:03.834 --> 07:05.633
do it just once for us.

07:06.934 --> 07:08.100
Well, ok.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.900
This is Jerry Kennedy
saying good night. And remember...

07:11.333 --> 07:13.800
wherever there's news, I'll be here.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.567
(serene music playing)

07:25.300 --> 07:26.233
(door opens)

07:29.800 --> 07:31.400
Ohh!

07:36.166 --> 07:38.500
Mmm-mmm!

07:41.934 --> 07:45.867
Oh, my, my, my, my, my!

07:46.667 --> 07:49.500
Why do I feel the need to bathe?

07:52.100 --> 07:53.400
So, how was it, Blanche?

07:53.467 --> 07:58.133
You might as well ask me to describe
the glory of the Smokey mountains

07:58.200 --> 08:02.800
-rising from the mist of dawn.
-They went to a sleazy motel.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
Or the colors of the monarch butterfly

08:06.667 --> 08:10.166
spreading its wings as it
emerges from the cocoon.

08:10.233 --> 08:12.767
She got him to pay for half the room.

08:14.900 --> 08:19.967
Or the sturdy cypress reaching heavenward,
tall and mighty and proud.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.333
That one, I think,
is pretty self-explanatory.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.100
(doorbell chimes)

08:31.166 --> 08:32.767
Who can that be?

08:32.834 --> 08:35.233
It's Jerry coming back
for his good-night kiss.

08:35.300 --> 08:38.233
Sometimes you're so busy buttoning up,
you forget.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.433
How do you do?

08:41.500 --> 08:43.734
I'm Millicent Kennedy,
Gerald's mother.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.066
How do you do?

08:45.133 --> 08:48.700
I'm looking for the cheap jezebel
who's ruining my Gerald's life.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.800
Blanche, company.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.100
Blanche Devereaux?

08:56.166 --> 08:59.066
I'm telling you to keep your hands
off my baby.

08:59.133 --> 09:03.200
He's very special.
Nobody can care for him like I can.

09:03.266 --> 09:06.533
Excuse me, but I haven't
heard any complaints.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
Oh?

09:07.667 --> 09:10.667
Did you know that Gerald
is afraid of clowns?

09:11.133 --> 09:14.467
Or that he can't go to the bathroom
except at home?

09:15.533 --> 09:17.934
So that's why there's
that look on his face

09:18.000 --> 09:19.934
right before they get to the weather.

09:22.567 --> 09:26.400
Just leave my dumpling alone, understand?
Or else.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.233
Blanche, why did you let her go?

09:31.300 --> 09:34.400
She's the perfect person to ask
if there's anything about Jerry

09:34.467 --> 09:36.400
I could make fun of at the roast.

09:38.767 --> 09:42.400
(calm music playing)

09:50.233 --> 09:53.033
We'll tell you our problem
if you tell us yours.

09:56.200 --> 10:01.100
That really won't be fair.
Now they know what's wrong with us.

10:02.567 --> 10:05.600
The sooner we do this,
the sooner you're rid of me.

10:06.233 --> 10:09.934
-Stanley.
-Ah, doc, you shaved the little beard.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.533
It's still 110, Stan.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.867
You must be Dorothy. Please, come in.

10:18.734 --> 10:21.300
I've heard only good things about you,
doctor.

10:21.367 --> 10:22.433
You want a hug?

10:23.767 --> 10:25.233
Maybe later.

10:27.533 --> 10:32.033
Doc, before you get started,
I just want to say that I love this woman.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.333
Although she's angry,
I believe she loves me.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.767
Please help us two
put this crazy marriage back together.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.433
(calm music playing)

10:42.133 --> 10:46.133
Put the marriage back together, you told
me we were coming here for closure.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.333
Stan, I'm confused, is this true?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.800
Doc, we're both men.
Let's not do this to each other.

10:51.867 --> 10:52.867
Stanley...

10:52.934 --> 10:55.233
Okay, okay, I lied,
but so what? You never have?

10:55.300 --> 10:59.033
Only once, Stanley. The night I told you
it was good for me too.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.967
(laughing)

11:03.367 --> 11:05.400
You said she didn't
have a sense of humor.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.867
Stan, it sounds to me like

11:08.934 --> 11:11.967
you're going to extreme measures
to make some kind of point.

11:12.033 --> 11:13.700
Just come out with it.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.500
Come home, mama bear.
Papa bear gets so cold sleeping alone.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.567
Couldn't you just medicate him?

11:25.233 --> 11:26.233
I would love to,

11:26.300 --> 11:28.734
but I'm not allowed to write prescriptions
for six months.

11:30.266 --> 11:31.734
Please, sit down, Stan.

11:33.700 --> 11:38.133
People, you may not believe it,
but these issues are not insurmountable.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.533
Not like that couple in the waiting room.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.100
Major problems in the sack.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.133
Doctor, that's confidential.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.066
-You shouldn't be telling us that.
-I know, but I like you.

11:50.266 --> 11:52.333
Stan, you have to ask yourself

11:52.400 --> 11:55.734
why you want a woman
who doesn't want you around.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.333
Well, I think I can answer that, doctor.
There's no other kind.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.700
You told me that when you were a boy,
your mother didn't want you around.

12:05.767 --> 12:09.033
So my mother didn't love me.
What's that got to do with anything?

12:11.834 --> 12:15.333
Sophia may not want me around,
but she loves me.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.166
-You hear what you said?
-I said you love me.

12:18.233 --> 12:19.567
You said "Sophia."

12:20.066 --> 12:25.700
-You meant me, but you said Sophia.
-You made that slip last session.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.300
-Who's Sophia?
-My mother.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.900
Calling Dr. Freud.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.567
I can't say anything definitively,

12:32.633 --> 12:35.333
but there's strong evidence
Stan doesn't actually love you.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.934
-I don't?
-He doesn't?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.066
That's correct.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.333
A theory is that he's neurotically
obsessed with you.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.567
Dorothy, we could build on that.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.467
Actually, he's obsessed with your mother.

12:47.533 --> 12:53.200
You're saying his desire to be with me
is really his desire to be with my mother?

12:53.266 --> 12:54.533
Wild, huh?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.600
It's all subconscious.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.533
Sophia represents Stan's own mother

12:58.600 --> 13:00.934
who passed away
before they could resolve things.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.200
This is rougher than the session
when I thought I loved you.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.166
I still have the flowers.

13:12.066 --> 13:16.266
To achieve closure, you need to hear
Sophia, that is, your own mother,

13:16.333 --> 13:17.500
tell you she loves you.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.300
There's not much we can do
without Sophia.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.400
-Can you get her to come?
-I don't know what to say.

13:24.467 --> 13:27.867
No one's ever asked me
to bring her along before.

13:30.033 --> 13:31.700
I'll do what I can.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.834
-Doc, you're a miracle worker.
-All part of being professional.

13:36.166 --> 13:37.967
Now, who's my 3:00?

13:38.500 --> 13:41.700
Great.
Mr. "I'm scared of the dark" is next.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.066
Want to hit the lights on the way out?

13:46.700 --> 13:50.100
(mellow music playing)

13:51.333 --> 13:54.033
Jerry is not a mama's boy.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.367
In fact, he and I came
to a major understanding.

13:57.433 --> 14:00.066
He and his mother aren't
going to see any other girls?

14:03.133 --> 14:07.500
Jerry is simply a man who happens
to be sensitive to his mother's needs.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.400
Ma, Blanche is right.

14:09.467 --> 14:12.533
Jerry's aware his mother
is getting on in years,

14:12.600 --> 14:16.900
he's concerned about her happiness, and
he's chosen to live at home with her...

14:17.333 --> 14:20.900
because he can't go
to the bathroom anyplace else.

14:29.667 --> 14:33.433
Here's my opening. Listen.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.500
"Good evening, everyone.

14:35.867 --> 14:38.867
I hope you enjoyed
your Cornish game hen."

14:42.100 --> 14:46.433
-What... what's so funny about that?
-I didn't set it up.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.200
See, we're serving Cornish game hen.

14:49.266 --> 14:52.200
Oh, well, now that you've explained it.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.066
This still doesn't say anything
about Jerry.

14:56.133 --> 15:00.367
I've drawn a blank.
I even called his brother.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.800
They haven't spoken since Jerry
was arrested for public nudity.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.133
Damn it.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.934
There's just nothing funny
about that clown-fearing mama's boy.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.467
He's not, and to prove it,

15:14.533 --> 15:19.667
he's bringing his mother here tomorrow
to stand up to her in front of me.

15:19.734 --> 15:21.200
Good for you, Blanche,

15:21.266 --> 15:23.967
but if confronting
Mrs. Kennedy doesn't work...

15:24.266 --> 15:27.300
the three of you might
consider joint therapy.

15:27.367 --> 15:30.166
Therapy's a wonderful idea.

15:30.433 --> 15:34.266
Oh, I remember St. Olaf's
most famous psychotherapists...

15:35.066 --> 15:38.500
the Freud brothers. Sigmund and Roy.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.500
They had a best seller,

15:43.567 --> 15:46.600
<i>If I have all the cheese I want,</i>
<i>why am I still unhappy?</i>

15:48.133 --> 15:51.467
Ma, all I know
is you wouldn't believe the progress

15:51.533 --> 15:53.233
that Stanley is making.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.600
I was going to invite you
to one of his sessions.

15:57.667 --> 16:01.533
A psychiatrist? Please.
We didn't need psychiatrists.

16:01.834 --> 16:06.133
You had a problem, you fought, you drank,
you got a little on the side.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.266
You dealt with it.

16:07.734 --> 16:12.934
(serene music playing)

16:23.433 --> 16:25.567
Wait a minute.
This isn't splash mountain.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.367
Ma, we're not going
to splash mountain.

16:31.633 --> 16:35.567
I want you to meet Dr. Halperin.
He's Stan's psychiatrist.

16:35.633 --> 16:38.633
-Mrs. Petrillo, I've heard about you.
-Lies. All lies.

16:39.734 --> 16:42.333
Yes, I wanted a boy,
but slowly I learned to accept her.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.200
-I meant it's nice to meet you.
-Oops.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.300
Please, sit down.

16:49.367 --> 16:52.033
Ma, as you know,
Stan's been having difficulty

16:52.100 --> 16:53.300
making it on his own.

16:53.367 --> 16:58.367
Dr. Halperin believes you can help him
in his struggle to separate from me.

16:58.433 --> 16:59.500
Sure, I can.

16:59.967 --> 17:02.433
Stay away from my daughter
or I'll have your legs broken.

17:04.133 --> 17:07.734
Ma, try to be serious.
Where are you going to get the $400?

17:11.533 --> 17:12.600
Rough guess.

17:14.066 --> 17:17.633
Without going into psychological detail,

17:18.100 --> 17:19.834
I believe Stan's clinging to Dorothy

17:19.900 --> 17:22.300
is really a suppressed longing
for his mother's love.

17:22.734 --> 17:26.200
My theory is that subconsciously
he's transferred that longing to you.

17:26.266 --> 17:27.667
And if you're wrong?

17:29.266 --> 17:31.333
I owe the parking guys a round of drinks.

17:34.033 --> 17:37.767
Tell Stan you love him.
He'll be out of our lives forever.

17:37.834 --> 17:40.033
You don't love him. How am I supposed to?

17:41.100 --> 17:44.266
-I'll give you $1,000.
-Sonny boy!

17:46.367 --> 17:48.200
That's enough, the both of you.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.333
This isn't the way it should be.

17:50.967 --> 17:54.333
If it isn't real, what does it mean?

17:54.834 --> 17:58.834
What, you're surprised? Love you? Sure.

17:58.900 --> 18:02.433
I love you for knocking up my daughter
when she was 17,

18:02.500 --> 18:06.767
for sponging off Sal and me,
for cheating on Dorothy left and right.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.600
Oh, yeah. I love you.

18:09.667 --> 18:13.033
I always haven't been the best son-in-law,

18:13.100 --> 18:16.834
but I've got good memories,
the four of us watching TV

18:16.900 --> 18:20.233
on that ugly green sofa
Sal bought from his boss...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.767
summer weekends on the jersey shore.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.000
It hasn't been all bad.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.767
Dorothy, help me out here.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.266
-Dorothy?
-I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

18:33.133 --> 18:35.600
If I have hurt somebody, I am sorry.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.600
I've hurt myself worse.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.400
Sophia... I did the best I could.

18:41.867 --> 18:43.500
I suppose you did.

18:43.567 --> 18:47.567
Can't you find it anyplace in your heart
to forgive me?

18:47.633 --> 18:50.033
Anyplace in your heart when you loved me?

18:50.500 --> 18:51.867
Have you loved me ever?

18:54.233 --> 18:57.200
There was that one morning
at St. Francis hospital...

18:57.266 --> 18:59.033
us peeking through
the maternity window

18:59.100 --> 19:01.233
when they wheeled Dorothy
and little Michael out.

19:01.734 --> 19:04.834
There was a whole happy future
in your smile.

19:06.033 --> 19:07.667
I suppose I did.

19:09.367 --> 19:10.867
Suppose I do.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.100
I do love you, Stan.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.133
I love you, Ma.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.934
Aw, this is great...

19:19.967 --> 19:22.066
but this is just the first step.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.066
Doctor, you are a genius. I feel great.

19:26.133 --> 19:29.300
Let's go to dinner and celebrate.
How does Chinese sound?

19:29.367 --> 19:31.367
I love Chinese food.

19:31.433 --> 19:35.066
-A celebratory dinner to bury the hatchet.
-Who invited you?

19:39.300 --> 19:40.667
Don't wait up.

19:40.934 --> 19:43.934
(serene music playing)

19:50.700 --> 19:54.133
You know, I cannot remember...

19:54.800 --> 19:59.433
when I had a sponge cake
quite so... moist.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.800
-Extremely moist.
-The moistest.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.233
I found the tea rather moist as well.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.834
What, I can't be uncomfortable, too?

20:16.166 --> 20:18.700
Well, I'm in the mood for another slice.

20:18.767 --> 20:23.500
Gerald, do you really feel
you need another slice?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.700
Oh, maybe you're right, mother.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.233
The television camera
does exaggerate the pounds.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.467
I don't see where a little sliver
would hurt.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.800
Finally some action.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.700
-Well, Blanche, I really shouldn't.
-Yes, Jerry, you should.

20:36.767 --> 20:37.967
No, he shouldn't.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.934
He's watching his refined-sugar intake.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.266
This cake is sweetened
with natural fruit juices.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.533
No, he shouldn't.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.066
His cross-country
skiing machine is in the shop.

20:49.133 --> 20:52.533
Yes, he should. He gets plenty...
and I mean plenty of exercise with me.

20:56.967 --> 20:58.767
Checkmate. Hand the guy a fork.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.500
Well, maybe I shouldn't.

21:02.567 --> 21:05.533
I mean, this darned girdle
is tight enough as it is.

21:07.734 --> 21:11.567
-Rose, did you catch that?
-I sure did, my friend.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.166
"Darned girdle."

21:13.734 --> 21:15.867
The man refuses to curse.

21:18.166 --> 21:23.567
Blanche, if you're going to insist
on contradicting every opinion I have,

21:23.633 --> 21:26.767
I won't allow Gerald
to continue seeing you.

21:26.834 --> 21:30.767
Allow me?
Mother, this is where it stops.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.600
See what happens?
You put sugar in his tea.

21:34.667 --> 21:38.133
-It's not sugar. It's you!
-Mama's boy, huh?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.233
I'm a grown man.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.567
I'm going to love the woman I want
whether she has your approval or not.

21:44.633 --> 21:47.867
Put this man's picture on a can of stew.

21:47.934 --> 21:51.400
You've shown me the light.
How can I repay you?

21:51.467 --> 21:53.233
Hawaii. Big island.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.900
Mother, you'll have to live
with your prejudices.

21:57.967 --> 22:02.066
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to be with the woman I love.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.033
-Oh, Jerry!
-I'm going back to Christina.

22:07.233 --> 22:08.567
Thanks again, Blanche.

22:09.233 --> 22:11.233
Gerald, wait!

22:11.300 --> 22:14.900
We don't like Christina. Remember?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.700
(door shuts)

22:17.467 --> 22:20.333
Blanche, honey, you ok?

22:20.400 --> 22:23.133
Why do these things keep happening to me?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.233
Why do I let them keep happening?

22:25.934 --> 22:30.133
I'm tired of getting all dressed up,
looking gorgeous, going out...

22:30.567 --> 22:32.633
only to lose out in the end.

22:34.033 --> 22:38.367
On the other hand, I am dressed up,
and I do look gorgeous,

22:38.433 --> 22:42.567
and... it is gringo night
at Hernando's hacienda.

22:44.467 --> 22:47.266
Oh, but I don't think I ought to go.
I'm just so vulnerable.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.100
Does anybody know how to say vulnerable
in Spanish?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.867
Oh, never mind.
I'll say it with my eyes.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.600
Adios.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.600
I said it before. I'll say it again.
Sluts just heal quicker.

23:11.934 --> 23:16.400
(theme music playing)
