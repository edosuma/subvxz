WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.749
CARTER: Previously on
Eureka...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.626
I think I need to
go away for a while.

00:06.423 --> 00:07.208
Boo!

00:07.382 --> 00:09.247
Eh! Holly!
Did I scare you?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.166
You're out.
And you're here.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.888
ZANE: She's dying again.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.341
Gentlemen.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.173
Uh-huh.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.841
Henry and Zane think
this bio-printer thing

00:19.019 --> 00:21.385
could actually
print you a body.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.138
Marry me, Jack.
Right now.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.603
I think she might like
a ring at some point.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.452
ALLISON: Cancun?

00:39.623 --> 00:41.033
CARTER: No.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.246
(GASPS) It's Fiji,
isn't it?
(CHUCKLING)

00:48.423 --> 00:49.333
You'll see. You'll see.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.714
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
you planned this.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.215
Yeah, I am awesome.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.092
So, is it, like,
right on the water?

00:54.263 --> 00:55.878
Ah. Only steps away.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.175
Jack, the airport
is the other way.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.890
I know.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.198
We're here.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.068
We're where?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.370
Our honeymoon cottage.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.415
Huh?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.244
It's great, huh?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.542
Surprise!

01:32.092 --> 01:35.801
Uh, Jack, you said
we were going somewhere
private and romantic.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.802
Yeah. And it's just
10 minutes out of town.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.470
(CHUCKLES) Okay, Jack.
Seriously, what is this?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.939
This is our home
away from home.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.941
I guess it was
Sheriff Cobb's cabin,

01:52.112 --> 01:53.773
and I got it, apparently,
when I got the job.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.984
I haven't had occasion
to use it until now, but...

01:57.618 --> 02:00.610
I thought we were going
to a resort in Fiji.

02:01.705 --> 02:05.539
Well, I heard that
you love my rugged
everyman quality.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.624
I don't remember
saying rugged.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.660
But this definitely is.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.050
I know it needs some work,

02:17.804 --> 02:20.637
but I've been
fixing it up,
and I want you

02:22.017 --> 02:23.598
to choose the details.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.758
(CHUCKLES) Wait.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.143
So, you want me to work
on my honeymoon?

02:27.314 --> 02:30.226
(CHUCKLES)
No. It's nesting.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.024
I also brought wine
and, and champagne,

02:33.195 --> 02:35.857
and a gourmet gift
basket from Vincent.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.521
lt's... lt's, uh...

02:42.537 --> 02:43.913
It's going to be fun.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.881
You put a lot of thought
into this, didn't you?

02:56.051 --> 02:57.461
I did.
(BELT CLASPS)

02:58.095 --> 02:59.301
Yeah.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.763
Look, Allie, um...

03:05.686 --> 03:07.347
My first marriage failed

03:07.521 --> 03:09.887
because I didn't
put down roots.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.265
I'm not going to
let that happen again.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.441
And this...

03:19.950 --> 03:21.110
Oh.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.609
...is how we're
going to build

03:24.204 --> 03:25.319
our future.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.701
Jack.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.953
(SIGHS)

03:35.090 --> 03:36.170
They're perfect.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.426
A trip lasts a week.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.431
This is going to
last a lifetime.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.850
I guess Fiji can wait.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.453
FARGO: Better speak up now
if you want anything changed.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.284
Oh, I'm not picky.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.370
Two arms, two legs...

04:13.378 --> 04:15.414
A face would be nice.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.922
Oh, your face is the last
thing to get bio-printed.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.963
So, Holly's Z-waves
will act as a bridge

04:22.137 --> 04:24.594
from her neural pattern
on the memory lattice

04:24.765 --> 04:27.222
to the photonic
microprocessor
in her new brain.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.472
And as soon as the
body's complete,

04:28.643 --> 04:29.894
then we can
start the transition.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.143
Yes. But once we begin,
we can't reverse the process

04:32.314 --> 04:34.475
or we'll lose what's
left of Holly for good.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.640
Well, then,
it has to work.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.433
Grace, thanks again
for being here.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.273
We couldn't have
done this without you.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.153
How could I stay away?

04:42.324 --> 04:45.612
Well, you know, when you
transfer someone's
digital consciousness

04:45.786 --> 04:48.823
to an organic form,
you get the expert.

04:48.997 --> 04:49.952
Now, me?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.114
Um... l'mjust
glad you're home.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.949
Me, too.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.457
HENRY: Holly? Fargo?
We're almost there.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.462
One body, coming up.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.045
I'll take mine
well done, please.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.133
What do you think?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.008
lt's...

(COUGHS)

05:45.136 --> 05:46.125
CARTER: So.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.886
It's got character.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.426
Right? I mean,
you see the potential.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.133
| see moss.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.643
And that scrapes right off.
Here. Come here.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.184
I want you to choose
a color for the main room.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.273
Are there other
rooms to paint?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.151
Not yet, no. But we
can expand, eventually.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.824
Jack.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.159
This place is charming.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.945
(CHUCKLES) Really.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.373
But I think it might be
easier if we
started from scratch.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.784
You want to tear it down?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.499
Listen, the engineers
at G.D., they can design

06:21.673 --> 06:24.585
a pop-up cabin to our
exact specifications.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.499
No paint required.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.548
Yeah, but where's
the romance in that?

06:30.765 --> 06:34.974
I want us to polish
this diamond in the rough,
with our bare hands.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.061
(SIGHS)

06:38.523 --> 06:39.899
What is it?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.985
Okay, well, can I
at least get some

06:45.155 --> 06:46.941
gloves or a hazmat suit?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.946
(GIGGLING)
Great. Yes. Great.
And you know what?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.903
If you use
your imagination...

06:51.870 --> 06:53.610
See, this place

06:54.539 --> 06:55.574
is a palace.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.739
I mean, if, if you
can look past the...

06:57.918 --> 06:59.533
Oh! Oh! Ah!

07:02.505 --> 07:03.711
(CHUCKLING) Are you...

07:03.882 --> 07:05.793
You need any help,
Your Highness?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.424
You okay?
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. No, yeah.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.051
It's a safe.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.132
Wow. Buried treasure.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.178
Great. Now, we can
buy a new floor.

07:16.353 --> 07:20.187
Yeah. Let's crack
this puppy open.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.360
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.438
Yeah, that's, uh,
really high tech.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.400
Oh, I don't need high tech.
I'm old school.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.236
Jack, it's titanium.
That's not going to work.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.616
Oh!

07:33.787 --> 07:34.947
(CHUCKLES)

07:35.121 --> 07:37.112
Yeah, good job,
Old School.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.199
l was just marveling
at the significance of
what we are attempting.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.289
Holly is a one
in a billion.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.047
Like Henrietta Lacks
and the discovery of
the immortal HeLa cell.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.332
I mean,

07:48.510 --> 07:51.001
we are about to give her

07:51.388 --> 07:53.800
new life.
ZANE: Now, I'm nervous.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.134
Good. You should be.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.593
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

07:56.768 --> 07:58.224
So. Shall we?

07:58.603 --> 07:59.718
Okay.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.935
(CONSOLE BEEPS)

08:01.106 --> 08:03.813
Holly, we're ready
whenever you are.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.065
This is it.

Doug, what if
it doesn't work?

08:11.533 --> 08:12.898
This could be sayonara.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.737
Adios. The end.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.196
It won't be.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.202
We still have so much
to do together.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.705
Go to Alaska and see
the northern lights.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.287
Go to CERN and make fun
of their tiny little
Hadron Collider.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.372
Can't miss that.
No.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.208
We're going
to do it all.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.880
Trust me.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.392
Okay. I'm ready.

Just hang on, Fargo.

No. No, no.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.901

Clear the interface.
Restore her neural pattern.

you we can't do that.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.437
Just do something.

I don't know
what went wrong.

definitely downloaded.

I'd keep her safe.

old case files.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.655
Well, why would
Sheriff Cobb have
them locked up here

11:02.829 --> 11:03.818
instead of at
the office?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.578
Maybe he wanted
to keep them private.

to go back to town

those files, lwould

12:33.544 --> 12:36.832
prepared the town
for your change in
corporeal circumstances.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.088
Ah, yes. Don't want
to spook the villagers.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.254
You guys, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.004
lt hardly seems
enough, but, um...

12:46.432 --> 12:47.547
Thank you.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.341
From the bottom of
my brand new heart.
Thank you. Thank you.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.010
(CHUCKLING)

12:56.234 --> 12:57.565
Doug?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.696
Are you okay?
You haven't said a word.

13:02.824 --> 13:06.612
Uh, why don't we, um,
double-check her diagnostics?

13:09.914 --> 13:10.949
What's wrong?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.955
Do | not look
like myself?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.325
No, you...

13:16.129 --> 13:17.289
You look perfect.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.455
| just can't believe
you're here.
I mean, for real.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.212
Whoa. Be careful.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.843
I can do it.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.298
Oh.
No, I've got you.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.268
Yeah. You do.

13:38.693 --> 13:39.978
What case files?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.735
They were locked away.
Hidden in Sheriff Cobb's
old cabin.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.112
That's weird, because
we kept all active
cases in the office.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.399
Well, maybe he was afraid
that someone would find out.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.737
Find out what?

13:48.911 --> 13:50.117
Sheriff Cobb
was investigating

13:50.288 --> 13:54.122
the formation of an
espionage consortium
right here in Eureka.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.577
Spies?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.833
I mean, um...

13:58.463 --> 13:59.623
Vinspresso?

14:00.590 --> 14:02.421
No, uh, thanks.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.960
Police matter, Vin.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.761
Mmm.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.086
Right.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.763
Let me see.
Okay.

14:12.894 --> 14:13.758
Exciting stuff,

14:13.936 --> 14:15.927
but this just
scratches the surface.

14:16.105 --> 14:20.018
I checked out all of
other Jo's case files when
we jumped into this timeline,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.479
and l... She made no mention
of this investigation.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.359
Obviously,
it was top secret.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.647
But maybe you can
solve the case now.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.277
We already did.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.659
Beverly Barlowe
was the spy.
Case closed.

14:31.829 --> 14:32.739
Maybe.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.326
But Sheriff Cobb suspected
a spy consortium.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.116
So, yes,
Beverly Barlowe is gone.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.875
But...

14:40.046 --> 14:42.128
Who was she
working with? Huh?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.590
There's only one
way to find out.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.548
CARTER: This is great.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.054
But I think we're going
to need more buckets.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.975
No, we need
a new roof.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.056
Yeah, well, it's on
the to-do list.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.721
Oh, oh, oh. I forgot.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.309
What?
I forgot.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.350
Kai;

15:03.528 --> 15:04.643
Uh, I think we're going
to need something

15:04.821 --> 15:05.776
a little more heavy
duty than lipstick.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.279
It's not lipstick.
It's a COPA-Cabana.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.486
Really? I thought, I was
hoping we'd be in more of
a Barry White sort of mood.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.198
No, Jack. It's a Compact
Portable Automatic Cabana.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.112
I packed it so that we
could use it on the beach.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.666
No. No A! furniture.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.793
I saw Fargo once almost
get swallowed by his MU-Tent.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.454
So, I think, I think...
I've got this covered.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.792
Yeah. I'm going with this.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.753
No, no, no, no.
I can fix this.

15:27.927 --> 15:32.261
This is a T-A-R-P.
Tarp, right?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.469
And if we tack this up
above our little
love nest, we will be fine,

15:35.643 --> 15:37.679
and this won't
devour you whole.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.891
Yeah. If you want any
devouring in your future,

15:41.065 --> 15:42.851
I would hurry up, Sheriff.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.359
Where's my hammer?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.861
Sheriff Cobb was
definitely onto something.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.569
Beverly Barlowe
is his star suspect.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.239
Well, what about
the other names?

15:56.414 --> 15:58.871
l cross-referenced
all the G.D. employees
with his investigation,

15:59.041 --> 16:02.784
and they've either
already left Eureka
or been redacted.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.669
Well, maybe it really is
a closed case, after all.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.711
Uh...

16:16.559 --> 16:17.890
Not yet.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.223
So, are you
ready for me?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.103
CARTER: I'm ready.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.353
Hi.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.744
Well, this wasn't
exactly what I pictured
for our honeymoon,

16:38.915 --> 16:42.248
but I do like the
sound of the rain.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.747
Mmm-hmm.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.805
This isn't such
a bad place.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.637
It has potential.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.437
Oh, oh, oh.
Baby, are you okay?

17:13.616 --> 17:14.776
I'm okay.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.111
Here, take...

17:20.373 --> 17:23.160
Well, you said
you liked the rain.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.005
This body is super bendy.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.461
Yeah, I can see that.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.378
Um, and you should
probably start referring
to it as my body.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.092
Oh. Right.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.008
I'm just glad all
my parts are working.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.186
Test my grip.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.278
Can you feel it?

17:51.445 --> 17:52.981
Oh, I can feel it.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.486
Excellent.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.822
How about this?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.206
Lips definitely working.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.038
We should make sure.
Just in case.

Quiet, quiet,

Who?

18:19.557 --> 18:20.717
Them.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.052
They trapped us in
a computer construct.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.933
No. No, Holly.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.265
Not anymore. We got out.
All of us. Remember?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.850
No, you just
think you did.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.140
None of this is real.

We have to get
out of here.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.246
Well, we're still here.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.829
Yeah. And...

18:51.255 --> 18:53.246
It looks like it
stopped raining.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.174
Oh, I know it was
a rough night,

18:57.345 --> 18:58.960
but the sun is out.
It's a new day.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.878
What do you say we...

19:01.057 --> 19:04.345
We make some
breakfast in bed
and just start over?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.600
I'll make
some coffee.
Okay.

So, no coffee.
No shower.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.418
FARGO: She doesn't remember
what happened last night.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.632
I put her to
bed,ﬁnaHy,

19:42.807 --> 19:44.798
and she woke up,
back to normal.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.964
Normal?

19:46.143 --> 19:48.555
Dude, she has a serious case
of the munchies right now.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.185
But I guess
that stands to reason,

19:50.356 --> 19:52.847
because she's been through
some pretty extreme
experiences lately.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.731
So, there's bound
to be some confusion. But...

19:54.902 --> 19:56.233
No, no. It was
more than that.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.066
She really believed we
were still in virtual Eureka.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.481
Mmm.
God, I missed
Vincent's food.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.366
Is there anything
better than eating
when you have a body?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.153
Well, oh, well,
except for, you know...

20:08.457 --> 20:09.742
Now it's awkward.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.532
So, when can
I get out of here?

20:11.711 --> 20:12.700
Let me just tell you,

20:12.878 --> 20:15.540
there is nothing like dying,
to make you hungry to live.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.296
Uh, we'll get you out
of here as soon as we can.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.922
We just want to make
sure that you're okay.
Mmm.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.128
Why don't you...

20:20.302 --> 20:21.883
Okay, that's...

20:22.930 --> 20:26.013
I'm afraid to let her leave
before we know she's stable.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.765
All right. Well,
let's help with the
transition, then. Um...

20:28.936 --> 20:30.847
Why don't you bring in
some of her favorite things?

20:31.021 --> 20:33.353
Uh, some music, photos,
your dorky little D&D game.

20:33.524 --> 20:34.684
That is not dorky.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.021
Really? Yeah,
it is, actually.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.107
Whatever. It will help
her feel comfortable.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.271

20:42.450 --> 20:43.360
Hmm?

20:43.534 --> 20:44.944

Oh, oh.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.863

20:53.002 --> 20:54.742
Where did you get this?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.755
Sorry, Henry.
It's classified.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.296
Do you know
what it is?

data storage device.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.848

21:10.019 --> 21:11.975
why don't I, uh,

21:12.146 --> 21:14.762
scan it and get
some specs?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.191
Thanks.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.610

to have Grace back in town.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.518
Yeah. You have no idea.

Whoa. That was quick.

21:22.907 --> 21:23.771
Huh.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.860
It's made of lithium
niobate crystal

21:26.035 --> 21:29.402
for an optical data
storage system.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.237
Optical data?

21:31.415 --> 21:32.165
Hologram.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.370
(GASPS) Maybe they
used the disks
for secret communiques.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.408
They?

21:36.962 --> 21:37.917
Uh...

21:38.672 --> 21:39.798
For example.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.501
You really need
an off-switch.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.211
What's going on, Jo?

21:43.385 --> 21:46.297
We think we may
have uncovered

21:47.014 --> 21:49.300
evidence of possible
espionage in Eureka.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.506
Really?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.722

of D&D?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.079
Oh, no.

Hey, there.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.371
Hey.
You left early.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.128
Yeah. I promised
Jo that I would,

22:21.298 --> 22:23.675
uh, get, uh,
this up and running.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.758
What does she
want with that?

22:26.929 --> 22:30.092
Well, she's come into
possession of a old
optical data disk

22:30.266 --> 22:32.803
and she needs
something to play it on.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.342
Really?
Mmm.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.938
Apparently, it was part
of an unsolved investigation
by Sheriff Cobb.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.475
He, uh, suspected
spies among us.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.562
But that would have
been, like, years ago.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.731
Yeah, but considering
our recent experience

22:48.909 --> 22:50.900
with Beverly Barlowe
and Senator Wen,

22:51.078 --> 22:53.660
espionage is still
something that we need
to take seriously.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.867
Oh, of course. I...

22:57.918 --> 23:02.252
So, um, I guess you are
just too busy, then,
to have breakfast with me.

23:02.756 --> 23:06.248
Um... It has been years.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.383

23:09.179 --> 23:11.636
oh-so-many breakfasts.

Freaking sticky thing.

the engineering lab.

a PhD to fix this.

Okay.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.573
You know what?
I'm your better half now.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.114
Or, at the very least,
your other half,

23:38.292 --> 23:40.658
and I think
you should let me...

23:41.003 --> 23:43.460
Protect and
provide a little.

23:44.089 --> 23:44.839
Like...

23:47.384 --> 23:48.715
This.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.922

Oh, I'm impressed.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.712
That's nothing.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.976
Oh. I feel better already.

Oh.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.365
Oh.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.287

24:37.685 --> 24:38.845
Jack.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.101
G.D. is huge.
Holly could be anywhere.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.811
Jo and Andy
are on their way.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.147

to freak if they see her
back from the dead.

lt's Global Dynamics.
They've seen worse.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.151
I never should have
left her alone.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.065
Fargo, we'll find her.
Let's just split up.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.360
We can cover more
ground that way. All right?

24:57.538 --> 24:58.823

25:00.165 --> 25:02.542
This hard drive hasn't
been used for years.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.417
I'm not quite sure
what kind of image
we're going to get.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.088
Let's give it a shot.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.459
This is so exciting.
Who's it going to be?

25:09.633 --> 25:11.419
At ease, Deputy.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.175
All right.
Here we go.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.851
Can you make it
any clearer?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.429
Well, I can try.

Oh!

a cold case,
but now, it's red hot.

Excuse me.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.710
What are you doing?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.796
I heard there was
a spy among us.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.005
Would you keep it down?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.670
This is an active
investigation.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.839
Is it true that when
Henry repairs the disk,

26:00.017 --> 26:03.350
you'll expose the spy who
sabotaged the hard drive?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.726
Where are you
getting this?

26:04.897 --> 26:07.183
I am the eyes
and ears of this town.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.688
And the mouth, apparently.

a right to know.

got you cleaned up.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.830
Right? And Vince
has outdone himself.

He's got homemade croissants,
he's got champagne,

26:27.503 --> 26:29.835
he's got some sort of seafood
something or other. It's...

26:30.005 --> 26:31.870
Sounds delicious.
Bring it on.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.758
We catch our breakfast.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.176
What?

26:45.354 --> 26:47.094
Doesn't that
sound like fun?

26:47.272 --> 26:51.436
Huh? I saw a reel
and a rod in the shed.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.817
(CHUCKLES) Now,
you want to fish?
Sure.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.318
I saw a bush.
We could get the berries.

Jack, I am
tired and hungry.

Allie.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.585

27:20.764 --> 27:22.846
Really. Because I know
that this is what you want.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.552
But this is our honeymoon.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.308
Did you ever even
stop and consider
what I wanted?

27:27.479 --> 27:29.515
Of course. You wanted
a romantic getaway.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.897
No, I want a roof.
I want running water,

27:32.067 --> 27:33.682
maybe even room service.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.226
I don't know,

27:35.404 --> 27:37.065
I don't think that's
unreasonable to ask.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.400
No, it's not unreasonable.
It's just not me.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.031
Well, this isn't me.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.075
Jack, this place
is unbearable.

to keep it old school.

Fine.

dropping out.

You can't drop out
of our honeymoon.

This is a disaster.

You're right.

28:02.723 --> 28:03.678
It is.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.806
I'm going to
call a travel agent.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.265
Okay?

28:11.440 --> 28:14.807
l'm... I'm going to book us
some place tropical.

and no ants.

28:19.740 --> 28:24.450

was do something romantic,

28:25.287 --> 28:28.074

She didn't even
try to explain.

That she was involved
with Beverly and Senator Wen?

think she'd betray her

after the Astraeus was found,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.223

needs time to adjust?

keep on breaking down.

she could lose touch
with reality for good.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.298

37:14.733 --> 37:16.269
You ready?
No.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.726
But do l have
a choice?

37:29.372 --> 37:31.033
Her BP's dropping.
Her pulse ox, too.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.287
She can get through.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.833
Zane, it's too
much for her.
Shut it down.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.494
We have to
see it through.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.174
(WHIMPERING)

37:50.685 --> 37:51.765
She's stabilizing.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.403
What now?

38:04.949 --> 38:07.440
Now, we wait to see who
she is when she wakes up.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.169
You came back.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.175
(SIGHS)

38:27.055 --> 38:28.716
You're my wife.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.554
I'm sorry you
found out this way.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.935
I never wanted you
to find out at all.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.515
Grace,

38:38.733 --> 38:41.099
you've got to help me.
I mean...

38:42.278 --> 38:44.018
How did you even
get involved?

38:44.197 --> 38:45.482
It doesn't,
It doesn't matter now.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.863
No, it does matter to me.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.739
I mean, I... You have to
tell me what happened.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.026
Were you coerced?
Did Beverly's people
threaten you?

38:51.204 --> 38:52.535
NO.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.498
No. l...

38:56.167 --> 39:00.877
There was a time when
I believed in their
mission to monitor G.D.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.709
But when their tactics
became destructive, I quit.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.748
While you were stealing
classified information.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.667
After sharing
information years ago.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.131
Yeah, but who knows
what Beverly took

39:09.305 --> 39:10.294
and adapted to
steal the Astraeus?

39:10.473 --> 39:11.849
I mean, you saw what
it did to those people.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.392
l was Captain of that ship.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.346
Those people were
my crew, Henry.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.556
Because Senator Wen
appointed you.
No.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.062
I had no idea that
she was working with Beverly,

39:20.233 --> 39:22.349
much less what
they were planning.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.108
Then who else
was involved?

39:26.906 --> 39:29.113
There was someone
on that disk that
you tried to destroy.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.364
And I can restore it.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.821
Henry, please.
Don't do that.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.653
VVhy?

39:39.627 --> 39:41.333
Who are you protecting?

39:48.428 --> 39:49.668
You.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.639
You introduced me
to Beverly Barlowe.

39:57.562 --> 40:01.726
We both shared classified
information together.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.976
You taught me
everything I know.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.857
HOLLY: l have to write
about this for the
G.D. archives,

40:12.035 --> 40:13.115
but I need a good title.

40:13.286 --> 40:16.323
How about
"The Second Coming
of Holly Marten?"

40:17.415 --> 40:18.700
Or is it the third?

40:18.875 --> 40:20.365
Nah, that sounds pretentious.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.749
And borderline offensive.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.081
I'll stick with
something scientific.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.416
Oh. Hey, sleepyhead.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.798
It's about time
you woke up.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.714
How are you?

40:34.098 --> 40:35.599
Fully present
and accounted for.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.132
ZANE: Her vitals are strong.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.516
Neurotransmitters
are healthy.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.142
There's no signs
of degeneration.

40:40.313 --> 40:41.598
She's back.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.263
Well, when can she
get out of here?

40:43.441 --> 40:46.183
Soon. But let's
just lay low

40:46.361 --> 40:47.692
and make sure everything's
still working properly.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.193
All right?

40:51.407 --> 40:54.240
I know one thing
that's working properly.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.960
Amen for that.

41:16.808 --> 41:20.471
Why in the world would
you come back to
the house of horrors?

41:20.645 --> 41:21.634
(CHUCKLES)

41:21.813 --> 41:24.020
Well, given what the
other couples in town
are going through,

41:24.190 --> 41:25.350
this didn't look half-bad.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.891
Are you kidding?
It was fully awful.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.234
True.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.232
But...

41:33.658 --> 41:37.150
I look at what Fargo was
willing to do for Holly

41:37.328 --> 41:40.786
and what Henry is going
through for Grace.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.251
And what you
tried to do for me.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.836
And all I could think is

41:50.008 --> 41:53.466
that any place is
the right place,
as long as I'm with you.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.137
I've got
a surprise for you.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.847
lt's... I'm going
to be installing
a solar-heated shower.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.057
I know, it's a
little high tech,

42:09.235 --> 42:11.351
but I think it's good.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.692
Okay. Well, as long
as we don't lose the
rugged everyman quality.

42:14.866 --> 42:15.946
You know how
much I love that.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.653
I do, I do.
I think we're fine,

42:17.827 --> 42:20.068
because this roof isn't
going to fix itself.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.737
Well, then, I better go
strap on my tool belt
so I can help you.

42:22.915 --> 42:26.043
Although, wait.
There is one thing you
have to promise me.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.620
Next trip,

42:28.379 --> 42:29.585
Fiji.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.329
Okay.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.996
Subtitling : C.M.C.
