00:06.167 --> 00:08.933
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.967 --> 00:11.900
Andy's springtime plans
come crashing down.

00:13.233 --> 00:15.933
ANDY: Fuckin-A man.

00:15.967 --> 00:19.333
NARRATOR:
An elusive creature puts
the Hailstones on high alert.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.700
AGNES:
Look, right in front of you.

00:21.733 --> 00:24.000
NARRATOR:
Glenn's quest for fire
gets choked.

00:25.533 --> 00:29.367
NARRATOR:
And Sue's dream for Kavik
is buried under ice.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.367
SUE:
I cannot replace that part.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.900
The hardware store
is a hell of a long ways away.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.067
AGNES: One, two, three. Go!

00:50.100 --> 00:52.100
We're down here in Kotzebue.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.533
It looks like it's going to be
a good day for oogruk hunting.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.433
One, two, three. Go!

00:58.233 --> 01:00.467
One, two, three. Go.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.333
Today, we'll be going out
with my cousin Victor's boat

01:03.367 --> 01:04.867
and he'll be driving
us out there.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.067
Ready?

01:09.067 --> 01:10.867
NARRATOR: This time of year

01:10.900 --> 01:14.800
the Hailstones turn their
attention to hunting
bearded seals, or oogruk,

01:14.833 --> 01:17.300
Alaska's largest species
of ice seal,

01:17.333 --> 01:19.600
and an essential resource
for the family.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.633
Jump in, Jon, jump in.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.767
(LAUGHS)

01:25.800 --> 01:27.767
I know Chip really wants
to be out here with us,

01:27.800 --> 01:31.133
but he really can't because
only the native people
can do this hunt.

01:31.167 --> 01:33.033
So, I've chosen my son Jon

01:33.067 --> 01:36.000
and my oldest daughter Tinmiaq
and they'll be joining.

01:36.033 --> 01:39.033
Hopefully, they'll be
oogruk out there,
if we're lucky. (CHUCKLES)

01:39.767 --> 01:41.400
Son, get the other one.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.567
NARRATOR: Seal hunting
is an Inupiat tradition

01:43.600 --> 01:45.800
that has lasted
for thousands of years,

01:45.833 --> 01:48.367
but in order to regulate
seal populations

01:48.400 --> 01:49.567
hunting laws prohibit

01:49.600 --> 01:52.600
non-natives from taking part
in the harvest.

01:52.633 --> 01:55.733
Okay, put that box
of shotgun shells in.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.333
It's gonna get splashed.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.933
Put that thermos bottle down.

01:58.967 --> 02:01.733
And make sure
your strings are pulled in
some for the anchor.

02:01.767 --> 02:04.933
And put your life jacket on.

02:04.967 --> 02:08.000
NARRATOR: Catching a seal
would provide the Hailstones
with meat and oil

02:08.033 --> 02:11.500
that will help them survive
the extreme cold of winter.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.233
AGNES: When we render
down the blubber

02:16.267 --> 02:19.767
we use it as our oil
when we dip our frozen foods
or our dried foods in,

02:19.800 --> 02:21.933
and that's usually
a real delicacy,

02:21.967 --> 02:23.233
and it gives us energy,

02:23.267 --> 02:26.333
so pretty much everything goes
with seal oil up here.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.800
(AGNES SPEAKS)

02:43.633 --> 02:44.867
(JON SPEAKS)

02:51.333 --> 02:52.500
(AGNES SPEAKS)

02:56.200 --> 02:58.067
(JON SPEAKS)

02:58.100 --> 02:59.133
(AGNES SPEAKS)

03:01.067 --> 03:02.133
It's right there.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.967
-Right there! Right there!
-Right there,
it's still bubbling.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.267
Next time, throw it, son,
so it stick.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.967
Right there, it's blood.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.133
On that side.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.933
It already sink?

03:21.767 --> 03:23.400
Right around there. Yeah.

03:24.033 --> 03:25.433
(JON SPEAKS)

03:27.867 --> 03:30.167
You never let go
of your harpoon, that's why.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.700
NARRATOR: Once the seal is
shot or punctured,

03:33.733 --> 03:35.900
it must be pulled
to the boat quickly,

03:35.933 --> 03:37.700
or it will sink to the bottom.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.467
Jon's failure
to harpoon this one
is a costly mistake.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.433
-(JON SPEAKS)
-(AGNES SPEAKS)

03:45.467 --> 03:46.900
Straight down.

03:46.933 --> 03:49.000
Aye yai yai yai yai.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.333
That was a seal, though.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.933
JON: It is quite a bit
challenging with
all the ice gone.

03:55.967 --> 03:58.300
Usually, you'd get
for sure shots or just

03:58.333 --> 04:01.767
a whole bunch
of oogruk are sleeping
or relaxing in the sun.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.700
But with all the ice gone,
now we have to
chase out some seals,

04:04.733 --> 04:07.633
and hopefully shoot them,
harpoon them,

04:07.667 --> 04:09.833
and get them into the boat
without sinking them.

04:09.867 --> 04:12.067
We've done it before,
we can do it again.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.967
SUE: So, I am fighting
for my way of life

04:19.000 --> 04:21.433
and I have every reason
to believe I will succeed.

04:21.467 --> 04:23.800
But I might not.
It's the roll of the dice.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.067
You ready to get out there?

04:37.100 --> 04:39.900
NARRATOR: For Sue Aikens,
the spring season means that

04:39.933 --> 04:41.667
Kavik River Camp
will soon be open

04:41.700 --> 04:45.500
to house scientists,
pilots, and travellers
passing through the tundra.

04:47.300 --> 04:51.300
But a lack of running water
could shut her down
before camp even opens.

04:53.933 --> 04:56.267
SUE: It's around the end
of May and I haven't
had running water

04:56.300 --> 04:59.367
since the beginning of
late September, early October.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.467
People come here,
stay with me

05:03.500 --> 05:04.900
to check out the tundra.

05:06.133 --> 05:08.533
Part of the services
is having running water.

05:08.567 --> 05:12.433
Water to do dishes, laundry.
Water to clean yourself.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.533
Now, you're just gonna
straighten this line out.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.167
Yeah, and then
we'll pull it back that way.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.967
Once we get it
straightened out.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.600
I have to have this filter,

05:19.633 --> 05:22.600
so I can filter
and run that water today.

05:22.633 --> 05:25.233
Because that river could flood
as early as tomorrow.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.067
When that happens
the water is silty

05:28.100 --> 05:29.633
and I can't put it
through my filters.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.267
If I wait till it's silty,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.967
I can have
all the water in the world
running down the river,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.967
but it's useless to me
and my guests.

05:37.267 --> 05:40.300
So I've gotta get it now
while it's clean and healthy.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.467
Then I can get it in,
filter it, treat it.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.767
I need to clear all this snow
so I can run a line,

05:48.800 --> 05:50.733
from the river
back to my camp.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.100
NARRATOR: With approximately
10 acres of land

05:54.133 --> 05:55.333
and a mile of waterline

05:55.367 --> 05:57.633
still buried
under five feet of snow,

05:57.667 --> 05:59.233
an essential piece
of the puzzle

05:59.267 --> 06:00.667
has yet to be found.

06:01.967 --> 06:05.833
My filter piece,
it is somewhere under the ice.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.000
Fuck me.

06:10.267 --> 06:11.833
That part is essential.

06:11.867 --> 06:13.900
Without it, I cannot
hook up to the pump.

06:13.933 --> 06:17.033
The importance of that piece,
it's the first piece
that goes into the water

06:17.067 --> 06:19.233
and sucks the water
into the pump,

06:19.267 --> 06:22.867
the pump pushes it
through the line, and voila,
I have water in camp.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.333
And I cannot replace
that part.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.900
'Cause the hardware store
is hell of a long ways away.

06:29.633 --> 06:32.567
The piece I need, the coupler,

06:32.600 --> 06:36.033
is on the end
of a long length.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.433
I am gonna guess
it's somewhere out here.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.200
Otherwise, I've just got
10 million acres

06:41.233 --> 06:42.300
to choose from.

06:45.667 --> 06:48.233
GLENN: I expect,
and I hope to die out here.

06:48.267 --> 06:49.500
That's my plan.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.000
Just not anytime soon.

07:02.967 --> 07:04.633
Firewood is important
out here.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.433
I spend a lot of time
cutting wood,

07:06.467 --> 07:07.833
all through the year.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.367
It's one of the bigger jobs
I have to do.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.200
And I don't have
any other source of heat

07:12.233 --> 07:13.467
other than a wood fire.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.833
I use it for
heating hot water.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.200
And I have a fire going
24 hours a day

07:18.233 --> 07:19.667
through the winter.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.267
And in the spring
and in the summer,

07:21.300 --> 07:22.500
I still use a fire.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.900
I couldn't live out here
without a fire.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.633
NARRATOR: A wilderness purist,

07:29.667 --> 07:32.167
Glenn forgoes
the use of power tools.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.033
He sets out equipped
with only an axe and his rifle

07:35.067 --> 07:36.933
for protection
from bears and wolves

07:36.967 --> 07:38.333
that lurk in the forest.

07:43.467 --> 07:45.333
GLENN:
This looks like a good area
to cut some trees.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.600
There're enough dead trees
in close in proximity

07:47.633 --> 07:49.400
that I can build a pile
right here.

07:49.433 --> 07:52.067
This forest is all
white spruce through here

07:52.100 --> 07:54.533
and I only cut dead ones
for firewood.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.700
And I've depleted
all the dead trees

07:56.733 --> 07:59.433
within three or 400 yards
in my camp,

07:59.467 --> 08:01.433
so I have to come quite
a ways now to get wood.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.933
Looks like a good one
to start on right here.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.967
I spend a lot of time
cutting firewood.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.333
It's a big part of
my life out here.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.067
This is the only way
I have to heat,

08:15.100 --> 08:16.867
and it's the only way
I have to cook,

08:16.900 --> 08:19.100
it's the only way I have
to get hot water.

08:25.267 --> 08:26.900
The Arctic is an environment

08:26.933 --> 08:30.433
where people could
never live without fire.

08:30.467 --> 08:33.767
That's why if I have a problem
and can't cut firewood,

08:33.800 --> 08:35.867
it can become a real issue.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.100
Cutting trees with an axe
is quite a bit of work.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.900
But I like that
it keeps me in shape.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.300
There. (SIGHS)

08:44.233 --> 08:46.967
A lot of people don't realise
how much you can get done

08:47.000 --> 08:49.100
with a simple hand tool

08:49.133 --> 08:52.167
because they grew up
in a world that
was all mechanised

08:52.200 --> 08:54.867
and they never learned
how to use tools like this

08:54.900 --> 08:56.333
or how to work like this.

08:58.033 --> 09:00.800
One hazard
of cutting trees with an axe

09:00.833 --> 09:02.767
is cutting yourself
with the axe.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.867
And that's why I like having
a good clean area

09:05.900 --> 09:07.233
around where I'm working.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.000
In the wintertime,
when it's cold

09:10.033 --> 09:12.867
I go through about
a quart of wood every month.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.300
And in the summer,
I still need
quite a lot of wood

09:17.533 --> 09:19.367
just for cooking
and heating water.

09:22.033 --> 09:23.767
Oh, I broke my axe.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.200
Damn.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.567
I just cracked my axe handle.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.133
It split right down
lengthwise.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.967
I'm gonna have to put
a new handle on that.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.200
And that will take
a little while,

09:36.233 --> 09:37.633
it takes some work.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.300
But that's the kind of thing

09:39.333 --> 09:40.900
you deal with
all the time out here.

09:40.933 --> 09:42.600
When things go wrong
you just fix them up

09:42.633 --> 09:44.433
and start working again.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.667
ANDY: We do have
time lengths on certain
aspects of our lives

09:49.700 --> 09:51.700
and we want to maximise that
while we can

09:51.733 --> 09:53.100
and then set ourselves up

09:53.133 --> 09:54.767
to being
in a different frame of mind

09:54.800 --> 09:56.000
when we get
a little bit older.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.000
You know, living out here
it's all about
planning for the future,

10:12.033 --> 10:14.167
and planning for the winter.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.833
Summer is nothing,
but preparing for winter.

10:18.167 --> 10:19.767
My goal in the next day here

10:19.800 --> 10:22.733
is to mill enough lumber up
to build a greenhouse.

10:22.767 --> 10:25.300
Let's just see what
20 feet from here is

10:25.333 --> 10:26.500
towards the house.

10:26.533 --> 10:28.733
I think I'm gonna build it
about 20 feet wide

10:28.767 --> 10:30.333
by 38 feet long.

10:30.367 --> 10:31.467
Then I'll be stretching

10:31.500 --> 10:33.167
a reinforced plastic
over that.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.500
Basically 80%
of our yearly food

10:36.533 --> 10:37.767
comes from our garden

10:37.800 --> 10:39.200
so it's pretty
essential for me

10:39.233 --> 10:42.233
to get this green house built
in the next day or two.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.867
I'm a week-and-a-half
to 2 weeks behind right now

10:44.900 --> 10:47.300
and that's not
making me feel real happy.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.000
Our season is very short.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.967
So, if I don't get these
plants into the ground

10:53.000 --> 10:54.067
in the next couple days

10:54.100 --> 10:55.533
it's really gonna
affect our harvest

10:55.567 --> 10:56.833
at the end of the year.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.067
Okay, let's just see if
we're somewhat square here.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.367
We're noticing
the climate change is making

11:06.400 --> 11:09.333
colder, wetter
midsummers for us,

11:09.367 --> 11:11.833
which really cuts in
on our growing season.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.900
So this greenhouse...

11:16.000 --> 11:18.600
Is our response to
climate change in this area

11:18.633 --> 11:22.200
by producing, uh, more food
in a controlled environment.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.167
Damn.

11:25.767 --> 11:27.100
First try.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.400
I don't know how I did that.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.200
We're getting close
to the point of actually

11:39.233 --> 11:41.000
standing up and framing
the greenhouse.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.433
We're gonna stand up
the centrepiece first

11:44.467 --> 11:47.100
and brace it
and then we'll stand up
the other wall.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.267
I've got all my pieces cut.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.467
We'll found out if
I measured right (CHUCKLES)

11:51.500 --> 11:52.700
in a little while.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.800
Here comes the rain.

12:01.133 --> 12:02.367
Right now,
the race against time

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
is to try and get as
much done

12:04.033 --> 12:05.700
before the storm
kicks us inside.

12:05.733 --> 12:07.767
And I'm hoping
we can get about another

12:07.800 --> 12:09.500
half an hour's
worth of work in

12:09.533 --> 12:10.967
before we're chased inside.

12:17.167 --> 12:20.033
KATE: Andy has got
the work ethic of an ant.

12:20.067 --> 12:23.000
He never stops.
He never gives up.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.700
He can work, and work,
and work, and work, and work

12:26.733 --> 12:28.200
until he just collapses.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.233
I admire that.

12:31.133 --> 12:33.667
-Okay.
-So I just drop it, right?

12:43.333 --> 12:44.533
Whoa!

12:51.733 --> 12:53.767
Something is just
really fucked up here.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.100

long tape measure?

12:56.133 --> 12:58.833

this stupid thing here.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.800

in measuring the foundation

13:10.233 --> 13:12.467

and they just don't look like

13:14.600 --> 13:15.900

13:17.000 --> 13:18.600
You know, according to
this level here

13:18.633 --> 13:20.800
it's showing it's out like

13:20.833 --> 13:23.400
eight inches at least.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.700
Right here, on this peg here.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.033
Outside, we're measuring
outside corners

13:35.067 --> 13:36.633
on all of these.

13:37.933 --> 13:39.700
This one's two inches short.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.233
It's a fuckin foot.
That's what it is.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.367
All right,
I'm done for the night.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.100
Fuck this. I'm fed up with it.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.300
GLENN: I'm a little
less dependent on culture

14:06.333 --> 14:08.300
than your average person today

14:08.333 --> 14:10.800
and I'm a little more
connected to nature.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.200
I was out cutting wood tonight
and I broke my axe handle.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.267
You just have to know
how to fix it

14:25.300 --> 14:26.900
and you just have to have
a few tools,

14:26.933 --> 14:29.200
you have to have a new handle,
which I've got.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.900
I'm just gonna saw it off.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.033
Now I have to put
a new handle on this head.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.767
I enjoy maintaining
my own tools out here.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.333
It's nice to feel independent.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.033
When you're using a tool that
you put together yourself,

14:55.067 --> 14:57.400
you know, you have a different
relationship to it,

14:57.433 --> 15:00.033
you feel more connected to it

15:00.067 --> 15:02.400
than one you bought
that was already assembled.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.433
The nearest place
where I can get any supplies

15:07.467 --> 15:10.300
is down in Fairbanks
a couple of hundred miles
south of here.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.367
So I have to plan carefully

15:13.400 --> 15:15.867
and make sure
when I go to Fairbanks,

15:15.900 --> 15:17.633
I get everything I need

15:17.667 --> 15:19.467
because I sometimes
stay out here

15:19.500 --> 15:21.367
for very long periods of time.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.200
I often ask people,

15:25.233 --> 15:27.167
"What's the longest
you've ever been

15:27.200 --> 15:28.433
without seeing anybody?"

15:28.467 --> 15:30.567
And a lot of people tell me
about 24 hours.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.000

15:32.033 --> 15:33.300
Which I find interesting.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.767
This winter I went
four-and-a-half months

15:37.800 --> 15:38.967
without seeing anybody,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.300
but there aren't
a whole lot of people

15:40.333 --> 15:42.700
that want to live
the way I want to live
out here.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.467
I'm not anti-social.

15:45.233 --> 15:46.567
I'm just anti-cultural.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.200
I don't care
for the way of life

15:50.233 --> 15:53.367
down in modern society
so I choose to live out here.

15:59.767 --> 16:02.600
Okay, my axe is already to go,
that's my favourite axe,

16:02.633 --> 16:04.867
and I got it all tuned up
just the way I like it,

16:04.900 --> 16:07.600

24:58.800 --> 25:01.567
And summer just
stretches on for a long time.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.900
That's the way it is out here.

25:02.933 --> 25:04.567
It's a whole
different sensation

25:04.600 --> 25:05.900
that goes on in your head.

25:05.933 --> 25:07.700
A whole different experience
of time.

25:18.367 --> 25:19.800
That's the wood
I'm gonna use

25:19.833 --> 25:23.633
for heating my camp,
cooking my food...

25:26.167 --> 25:27.633
Heating my water
to take a bath,

25:27.667 --> 25:29.167
and do my laundry.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.033
That's my fuel out here.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.633
Out here you do
what nature requires.

25:35.667 --> 25:36.733
Nobody tells you

25:36.767 --> 25:38.133
you gotta get up
and go to work today

25:38.167 --> 25:39.800
so you can pay
your heating bill.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.933
Out here you realise
you need wood

25:41.967 --> 25:43.233
'cause it's getting cold.

25:43.267 --> 25:45.400
And you haven't got enough
to keep the fire going.

25:46.367 --> 25:47.600
That's what
motivates you out here,

25:47.633 --> 25:49.833
is what actually
has to be done for you,

25:49.867 --> 25:51.733
not what somebody else
needs you to do for them.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.067
Living out here
keeps you in shape

25:56.100 --> 25:57.233
and I enjoy that.

25:58.567 --> 25:59.800
I've had
a lot of people tell me

25:59.833 --> 26:01.600
that they would love
to live out here,

26:01.633 --> 26:03.133
but I don't think many of them

26:03.167 --> 26:04.833
would stay long
if they really did it.

26:06.333 --> 26:10.633
Physically, living out here
is damn hard work.

26:10.667 --> 26:13.933
But psychologically,
it's hell of a lot better

26:13.967 --> 26:15.467
than the way
people have to live

26:15.500 --> 26:16.967
down in civilisation today.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.133
ANDY: We don't have to chase
the all mighty dollar
living out here.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.967
That's not
our focus in life at all.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.033
Our focus is to have
a really high quality of life,

26:28.067 --> 26:29.500
and live the way
we want to live.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.733
I'm feeling pretty good.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.400
I think everything's gonna
start coming together now.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.467
Got a good night sleep.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.767
Reset my foundation
this morning.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.833
I think we're going to start
cranking on it now.

26:52.233 --> 26:54.333
After we get this secured,

26:54.367 --> 26:57.867
the next step is gonna be to
get the side walls framed up,

26:57.900 --> 26:59.067
and cut the rafters in.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.833
That's really gonna
tie everything together.

27:00.867 --> 27:02.167
(ENGINE REVVING)

27:02.200 --> 27:03.867
There's really no hard part.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.833
It's just all in the hoping

27:05.867 --> 27:08.200
that nothing slips
and moves on you.

27:10.267 --> 27:11.867
He just had some time
to think about it,

27:11.900 --> 27:13.167
change a few things.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.300
If you took a tour
of our property,

27:17.333 --> 27:18.800
and you can see
all the buildings,

27:18.833 --> 27:20.033
and all the structures

27:20.067 --> 27:23.700
that have gone up from dishes
to windmills to showers.

27:23.733 --> 27:27.133
I don't think one has gone
completely smooth. (CHUCKLES)

27:30.933 --> 27:33.700
ANDY: This is the main
hard part to get done.

27:33.733 --> 27:36.400
Kate doesn't have the strength
to lift up these heavy beams,

27:36.433 --> 27:39.000
but we were able to get it
started with the bulldozer

27:39.033 --> 27:40.933
and then use leverage
to push it up

27:40.967 --> 27:42.600
a little bit at a time.

27:42.633 --> 27:44.467
I'm rocking now.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.133
Or I should say,
we're rocking now.

27:52.233 --> 27:54.833
-What?
-Not this right here.

27:58.367 --> 27:59.800
Just pull it tight like that.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.100
Oh! Fuckin-A man!

28:06.767 --> 28:08.133
(SIGHS)

28:11.900 --> 28:13.567
That really fucking
pisses me off.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.700
-I didn't do that.
-Yeah, you did.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.233
You pulled on
the fucking string too hard.

28:23.267 --> 28:24.800
KATE: I never even had
my hand on the string.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.367
You're the one
that tugged the string.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.433
-Okay.
-You said, "Pull it tight like
this" and you yanked it.

28:29.467 --> 28:31.233
-So don't look at me!
-Okay.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.933
(ANDY LAUGHS)

28:35.600 --> 28:37.033
I wonder how many
more fucking things

28:37.067 --> 28:39.700
we can do to fuck
this whole project up.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.767
You gotta be
fucking kidding me, man.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.500
Why do it once
when you can do it
four fucking times?

28:50.467 --> 28:53.567
Fucked up fucking project
I ever worked on around here.

28:55.833 --> 28:57.033
This whole fucking thing

28:57.067 --> 28:59.133
is turning into
a big fucking quagmire.

29:02.967 --> 29:05.767
GLENN: I'd rather die up
on one of these mountains
if I had to.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.233
But I'm not planning to.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.633
This is the best way of life
for me to live

29:11.667 --> 29:13.433
and I'm going to do it
as long as I can.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.700
NARRATOR: A stockpile of wood

29:21.733 --> 29:23.900
means that Glenn
can afford a luxury

29:23.933 --> 29:25.467
he doesn't have often.

29:26.967 --> 29:28.667
The ability to do laundry.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.333
Now, when I'm down
in Fairbanks

29:34.367 --> 29:36.200
I do my laundry
at the Laundromat,

29:36.233 --> 29:38.467
and I never get excited
about going to the Laundromat.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.100
But I really enjoy
doing laundry out here.

29:40.133 --> 29:41.300
I got a great view.

29:43.567 --> 29:45.567
The birds are singing.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.833
I can't think of a better way
to spend the afternoon.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.833
My philosophy is
keep your technology simple,

29:51.867 --> 29:53.167
things won't go wrong.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.400
There's not much
that can go wrong

29:54.433 --> 29:56.267
with this washing machine
right here.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.200
I really don't like to do
useless exercise

30:05.233 --> 30:06.533
where you just running around,

30:06.567 --> 30:08.833
like a hamster in one of those
little wheels

30:08.867 --> 30:10.100
they got in the hamster cage.

30:10.133 --> 30:13.233
I like to get my exercise
doing useful jobs.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.967
Step two,
put it through the old ringer.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.200
This ringer here
used to be my mom's.

30:24.233 --> 30:26.100
She brought this 50 years ago.

30:26.133 --> 30:29.200
How many washing machines
that were brought today
will be running in 50 years?

30:31.933 --> 30:34.167
This ringer
does have limitations.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.867
Down around 30 below,
it starts to freeze.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.433
Thirty below
is about the limit

30:38.467 --> 30:39.867
for doing laundry out here.

30:40.833 --> 30:42.667
Okay, all that's left
is to hang it up.

30:46.133 --> 30:49.467
Laundry's all done,
probably be dry by tonight.

30:50.467 --> 30:52.067
If I was in town
I'd still be on the road

30:52.100 --> 30:53.367
headed to the Laundromat.

30:57.267 --> 30:59.767
SUE: Well, it's not that
I don't want to
look you in the eye,

30:59.800 --> 31:01.733
I can't afford to
look you in the eye.

31:01.767 --> 31:04.300
I watch my horizon endlessly.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.400
The only warning I get
is paying attention.

31:16.867 --> 31:18.967
NARRATOR: With the opening
of camp approaching,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.833
Sue is expecting a shipment
of 5,000 pounds of food

31:21.867 --> 31:23.267
to feed her guests.

31:25.367 --> 31:26.533
(BOB SPEAKS)

31:28.200 --> 31:29.700
Hey, buddy, how are you doing?

31:29.733 --> 31:31.700
(BOB SPEAKS)

31:31.733 --> 31:34.600
Doing good. It is...
Yeah, we don't have
any wind down here.

31:34.633 --> 31:36.667
It's calm as anything.

31:36.700 --> 31:38.767
You got about a mile
of clean runway going.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.067
BOB: Okay.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.033
Bob is shuttling our food
out of Prudhoe Bay.

31:44.067 --> 31:47.300
5,000 pounds is gonna
get us through September,

31:47.333 --> 31:49.400
but it's for all the hunters,
and bird people,

31:49.433 --> 31:50.933
everybody that comes
to the camp,

31:50.967 --> 31:52.433
so we have something to eat.

31:54.067 --> 31:56.467
All right, buddy,
I will be out there
in just a jiffy.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.600
BOB: Okay.

32:01.033 --> 32:02.400
Time to get some groceries.

32:06.233 --> 32:07.600
All right, time to unload.

32:10.867 --> 32:12.800
SUE: This is the first
load of goods

32:12.833 --> 32:15.000
that I've been able
to get in this year.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.900
You know, when I'm here
for about the nine
or 10 months by myself,

32:17.933 --> 32:19.300
I eat game meat.

32:19.333 --> 32:21.933
Grocery store is too far away.
I have to supply myself.

32:21.967 --> 32:24.267
But when people are here
it would be illegal

32:24.300 --> 32:25.567
for me to feed them game meat.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.800
That's hunting for profit
and that's against the law.

32:27.833 --> 32:29.667
So I have to bring in
store-bought food.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.200
And it cost me well over
three bucks a pound

32:33.233 --> 32:34.467
to get up here.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.933
It cost me 70 bucks an hour

32:35.967 --> 32:37.533
plus 5% of the total

32:37.567 --> 32:39.033
to get somebody
to shop for it,

32:39.067 --> 32:41.433
so a gallon of milk
by the time I get it here

32:41.467 --> 32:42.833
is about 50 bucks.

32:42.867 --> 32:45.033
And it's a couple of
100 bucks a day
to keep it cold.

32:45.067 --> 32:48.633
So, by the time
I pour it for you
it's about 25 bucks a glass.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.533
But you can't run a business
or live here by mistake.

32:50.567 --> 32:51.867
It's a conscious choice.

32:57.633 --> 33:01.133
This area here is dry storage.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.200
I try to project
how many people do I think

33:03.233 --> 33:04.433
I'm gonna get.

33:04.467 --> 33:06.100
What do I think
they're going to eat?

33:06.133 --> 33:07.733
It's a guessing game.

33:07.767 --> 33:10.100
But I try to be
as accurate as I can...

33:11.067 --> 33:13.567
...and then I order it
from town.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.300
I can tell you damn near
everything that I ordered

33:15.333 --> 33:16.767
didn't come in right, but...

33:22.967 --> 33:25.100
All right, the rest of that
goes in the dry.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.400
I gotta call him
and let him know that,

33:26.433 --> 33:28.600
yeah, there should be
a ton more in the freeze.

33:29.867 --> 33:33.733
When you've only got
550 pounds of 5,000,

33:33.767 --> 33:35.133
I've got a lot missing.

33:35.167 --> 33:37.867
It's $1,000 or $2,000
worth of meat.

33:37.900 --> 33:42.067
Steaks, chicken, ribs,
burger, bacon,

33:42.100 --> 33:43.933
you know, nobody wants to
lose all that stuff.

33:43.967 --> 33:47.167
And sometimes things happen,
but people spend a good penny,

33:47.200 --> 33:49.300
and maybe save
their whole lives
for one trip up here.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.733
So, it's up to me to give them

33:51.767 --> 33:54.133
the most I possibly can
for their trip.

33:54.167 --> 33:56.667
High quality, high fun.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.000
When I get less than that,
I'm not happy.

33:59.033 --> 34:02.067
So, I need to verify
that it's there.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.933
Hopefully, there is
more freeze over there.

34:05.667 --> 34:06.700
(BOB SPEAKS)

34:06.733 --> 34:07.833
Hey, buddy, are you there?

34:07.867 --> 34:09.600
(BOB SPEAKS)

34:09.633 --> 34:13.033
SUE: Yeah, you were saying
that you thought you brought
all the freeze and chill?

34:13.067 --> 34:14.867
Oh, okay,
I just wanted to make sure

34:14.900 --> 34:16.600
'cause I thought you said
you'd brought it all,

34:16.633 --> 34:19.467
and I was going to say,
"Holy cow,
I'm missing a lot of stuff."

34:19.500 --> 34:21.433
Well, all right buddy,
I sure appreciate it,

34:21.467 --> 34:23.700
and you sure fly safe,
and I'll see you
when you land.

34:25.233 --> 34:27.633
Cool. Yeah, he had said
that he brought it all out.

34:27.667 --> 34:30.200
But when he got back there
they made another delivery

34:30.233 --> 34:32.300
and there's four more coolers
coming soon.

34:36.600 --> 34:37.833
Might be dead?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.600
The compression
is not coming on at all, Sue.

34:41.733 --> 34:43.033
-Yeah.
-SUE: Dead?

34:43.067 --> 34:45.133
-Dead.
-Awesome.

34:45.167 --> 34:46.633
-That is so cool.
-RICKY: Yeah.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.567
SUE: Well, welcome to
the world of being an owner.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.933
RICK: Yeah.

34:52.967 --> 34:55.267
You know, when I'm ordering,
I know here.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.267
How much space do I have,

34:57.300 --> 35:00.000
how many mouths
do I gotta feed,
what can I fit in,

35:00.033 --> 35:01.233
at what kind of turn around

35:01.267 --> 35:04.100
on the products so that
they still at top quality.

35:04.133 --> 35:08.300
And so I ordered in to fill
all my different fridges,

35:08.333 --> 35:09.767
but I plugged it in and...

35:11.267 --> 35:13.967
This little guy
has to go back to town,
he's dead.

35:15.733 --> 35:18.800
Well, I have to pay somebody
$70 an hour to shop for it,

35:18.833 --> 35:20.667
and then 10% of that bill,

35:20.700 --> 35:22.733
and then another $700
to come in.

35:24.033 --> 35:25.233
Here we go.

35:25.267 --> 35:27.967
So a 1960's fridge
is gonna end up costing me

35:28.000 --> 35:29.500
probably $3,000.

35:31.567 --> 35:33.933
But I don't live my life
dwelling on the negative.

35:33.967 --> 35:37.467
I look for the next challenge
and this thing is a behemoth

35:37.500 --> 35:39.133
with how much it uses power.

35:39.167 --> 35:41.733
Here's a chance
for me to be more efficient.

35:41.767 --> 35:45.300
I will ring up
a more eco-friendly
piece of equipment.

35:45.333 --> 35:46.800
It's had a happy life,
you know,

35:46.833 --> 35:48.600
get it out the door,
and get a new one in.

35:48.633 --> 35:50.767
So when the plane comes in,

35:50.800 --> 35:54.700
for me to run a business,
having a bunch of people
in and out,

35:54.733 --> 35:56.467
I gotta have
another working fridge.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.667
(BOB SPEAKS)

35:59.700 --> 36:01.567
I mean, you can't plan
for everything.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.300
But that's the wonderful life
of being an owner

36:03.333 --> 36:04.800
and just the complication

36:04.833 --> 36:06.267
of choosing to live
in the Arctic,

36:06.300 --> 36:07.633
and it's a choice.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.300
You know,
I came here fully knowing that
it's a son of a gun

36:10.333 --> 36:11.667
to try to get
anything out here.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.600
And it's just another day
in the park, Kaczynski.

36:14.633 --> 36:15.733
(LAUGHS)

36:24.200 --> 36:25.867
AGNES: Sometimes we don't
always have money

36:25.900 --> 36:27.033
to go to the store.

36:27.067 --> 36:28.800
So we pretty much rely on

36:28.833 --> 36:31.300
mostly subsistence living
out here.

36:47.167 --> 36:48.933
This is the seal
we just got back with

36:48.967 --> 36:50.400
from our seal hunt.

36:51.867 --> 36:54.533
It takes two, three seals
to make up for the oogruk,

36:54.567 --> 36:56.467
but this is a good start.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.733
We can just go on ahead
and start taking it apart.

37:02.233 --> 37:04.533
NARRATOR:
The process of harvesting
seal meat and oil

37:04.567 --> 37:06.700
has been perfected
over centuries

37:06.733 --> 37:09.533
and passed down to Agnes
from her ancestors.

37:11.567 --> 37:13.600
AGNES: You wanna try
and keep the meat

37:13.633 --> 37:17.333
with the meat,
and keep the oil with the oil.

37:17.367 --> 37:19.700
When you start to mix the meat
with the blubber

37:19.733 --> 37:22.400
it always gets kind of rancid
a little too quickly

37:22.433 --> 37:26.500
so you've gotta try and do it
nice and slowly, and careful.

37:37.433 --> 37:40.100
Now that we're done
cutting up all the blubber,

37:40.133 --> 37:42.567
and making
little tiny strips like this,

37:42.600 --> 37:45.933
all we do is
put this in the porch.

37:45.967 --> 37:48.700
That way every time
we walk around the house,

37:48.733 --> 37:49.900
the bucket will shake

37:49.933 --> 37:51.667
and it'll let
the bubbles rise up

37:51.700 --> 37:53.600
and we have to stir it
everyday.

37:53.633 --> 37:55.467
And by the next couple of days

37:55.500 --> 37:57.900
it should be
from blubber to oil.

37:57.933 --> 38:00.100
And then, we'll be able to
put the black meats

38:00.133 --> 38:02.667
that are dried
into the bucket of oil

38:02.700 --> 38:04.600
and then that would
preserve it

38:04.633 --> 38:06.633
throughout the summer.

38:06.667 --> 38:09.100
I guess I took
most of the blubber off.

38:09.133 --> 38:11.767
All I have to do now
is wash it up, soak it

38:11.800 --> 38:14.000
so all the blood
and the yellow oils

38:14.033 --> 38:15.333
come off of it.

38:15.367 --> 38:18.233
Then we'll stretch it
and then I'll start tanning it

38:18.267 --> 38:20.267
because we're wanting
to make a vest.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.567
We were wanting to make it
out of ringed seal

38:22.600 --> 38:24.400
so here's our ringed seal.

38:26.700 --> 38:30.033
A few ribs from the seal
and the black meat

38:30.067 --> 38:32.533
that I want to hang
until, like, tomorrow

38:32.567 --> 38:35.033
when it dries up
a little bit more

38:35.067 --> 38:37.500
and then after that
I'll strip it.

38:37.533 --> 38:39.833
The first step is to
have this piece dry up.

38:46.067 --> 38:48.200
And by tomorrow,
say afternoon,

38:48.233 --> 38:50.200
it should be ready.

38:50.233 --> 38:52.667
I'm now done with
my seal hunting adventure.

38:53.267 --> 38:55.200
One big bloody mess.

38:55.233 --> 38:56.800
The mess of success.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.467
ANDY: The reason
we live out here

39:00.500 --> 39:03.567
is 'cause we don't have people
telling us how to do things.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.900
And that's what
freedom brings you.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.867
KATE: Just as important as
living out here

39:19.900 --> 39:23.700
and living off the grid,
we also live off the code.

39:24.567 --> 39:25.800
Come on up.

39:25.833 --> 39:28.700
The written code of cities,
and towns, and hamlets.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.100
And, there are no permits
to be had.

39:31.133 --> 39:34.600
There are no building codes.
We can build what we want.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.133
Don't have to ask
anyone's permission
to do anything.

39:39.867 --> 39:41.500
You live by your own dream

39:41.533 --> 39:45.100
and I think that's
the most amazing way to live.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.900
May not be
the easiest way to live,

39:47.933 --> 39:50.100
but, boy,
it's the freest way to live.

39:50.133 --> 39:52.700
ANDY: (CHUCKLES)
God, that was stupid.

39:54.567 --> 39:56.500
KATE: Well, it wasn't
that hard to fix.

39:56.533 --> 39:59.033
ANDY: No, just made me
feel like a real moron.

40:01.467 --> 40:02.700
It's gonna be this one.

40:06.633 --> 40:07.967
ANDY: It's a little bit
different than the way

40:08.000 --> 40:09.467
most people would
build a greenhouse.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.400
Most people go
very light framing,

40:11.433 --> 40:13.200
very light structures.

40:13.233 --> 40:16.033
But I'm trying to build this
greenhouse very stout

40:16.067 --> 40:19.667
because I plan on this lasting
many, many years for me.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.533
-Yay!
-The worst is over.

40:22.167 --> 40:23.767
The hard part.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.800
A little bit of problems
pulling one wall up,

40:25.833 --> 40:28.167
but it all came together good.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.067
And so we got her
all framed up

40:30.100 --> 40:31.767
and ready to stretch
some plastic on it,

40:31.800 --> 40:33.067
and throw the plants in,

40:33.100 --> 40:35.167
and start growing
our winter food source.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.867
Just in the final stages here.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.300
Everything is looking
really good.

40:40.333 --> 40:44.333
There you go,
now pull it down until it hits
the very bottom.

40:44.367 --> 40:45.800
This material probably
would have cost

40:45.833 --> 40:49.567
well over $1,000
if I was to go out and buy it.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.133
This whole greenhouse
is probably only gonna cost me

40:52.167 --> 40:57.533
about $25 in gas
and $120 in plastic.

40:57.567 --> 41:02.067
So, for $150, I'm gonna get
a 20 by 30-foot greenhouse.

41:02.100 --> 41:05.433
You can't do that
doing it any other way.

41:05.467 --> 41:08.500
We can build it anyway
we design it in our heads.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.167
We have the freedom
and independence here

41:10.200 --> 41:12.267
to do things anyway we want.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.600
And that's why
we like it here.

41:13.633 --> 41:15.467
All right!

41:15.500 --> 41:18.867
KATE: It's 100 degrees
in the back of the cabin
right now.

41:18.900 --> 41:21.133
ANDY: Sounds like a good time
to go into a hot greenhouse

41:21.167 --> 41:23.500
and start planting to me.

41:23.533 --> 41:26.100
In the back if my mind
I'm always thinking
I'm getting older,

41:26.133 --> 41:28.600
I don't have a lot of years
left of this hard work in me,

41:28.633 --> 41:30.133
and so when I'm 70,

41:30.167 --> 41:33.233
I'm not gonna be able to
go out and do the things
I can even do now.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.800
So we're thinking and planning

41:35.833 --> 41:37.700
on how we can set
our life up here

41:37.733 --> 41:40.000
so that we can live
the rest of our lives,

41:40.033 --> 41:42.000
basically, live to be
old people out here

41:42.033 --> 41:44.100
and still be able to do
the things we need to do.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.200
I got a lot of satisfaction
out of building this.

41:50.233 --> 41:52.800
I felt really good
when I pounded
that last nail in.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.767
And then every time
I walk in here,

41:54.800 --> 41:56.633
I'm gonna remember
every log that I cut.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.700
It'll remind me
of all the goofy things

41:58.733 --> 42:00.433
that happened
while we were building it.

42:00.467 --> 42:01.567
Most of the times

42:01.600 --> 42:03.333
it's all about the trials
and tribulations,

42:03.367 --> 42:05.167
and screw-ups,
and close calls,

42:05.200 --> 42:07.300
and near death experiences.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.600
Those are the exciting things
to talk about

42:09.633 --> 42:10.933
so if you don't have
that in your life,

42:10.967 --> 42:12.933
you're not living much,
you know.

42:12.967 --> 42:15.400
This is one of
the most important projects
of the summer.

42:15.433 --> 42:18.133
It's truly,
the most wonderful
miracle in life

42:18.167 --> 42:21.667
is to watch something grow,
and that you helped.

42:21.700 --> 42:25.233
It means more to me than
I can possibly put into words.

42:27.533 --> 42:28.700
(ANDY SIGHS)

42:29.500 --> 42:30.767
KATE: Stop now!

42:30.800 --> 42:31.967
(ANDY EXCLAIMING)
