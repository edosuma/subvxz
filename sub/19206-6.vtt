WEBVTT

00:00.016 --> 00:01.391
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.416 --> 00:02.655
Young Money, baby!

00:02.680 --> 00:05.130
That's totally insulting.
You know that, right?

00:05.155 --> 00:06.375
So, you're hunger striking?

00:06.400 --> 00:08.233
I'm camping in front of the BSU

00:08.269 --> 00:09.664
<i>and refusing to eat.</i>

00:09.689 --> 00:11.956
All I can really offer is my support.

00:12.004 --> 00:13.970
Regina: <i>Luca and I are together.</i>

00:14.006 --> 00:15.005
Oh. Wow.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.276
It's unreal!

00:16.300 --> 00:17.652
What is he, like, 25?

00:17.677 --> 00:19.677
I think we should take the summer,

00:19.945 --> 00:21.878
- see what happens.
- Mingo.

00:21.914 --> 00:22.913
That was the president.

00:22.948 --> 00:24.677
He wants to meet with us

00:24.702 --> 00:26.825
to address the rest of our demands.

00:26.850 --> 00:27.884
- Yes!
- Whoo!

00:27.920 --> 00:30.575
Bay: I've done this
before dozens of times.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.144
In another country. You're
not ready for a chair.

00:33.169 --> 00:34.791
Bay: <i>Rip off designs?</i>

00:34.816 --> 00:37.067
<i>Some do, but not Noelle.</i>

00:40.766 --> 00:44.701
The first few days, I
just had chicken broth,

00:44.736 --> 00:46.803
and then I had an apple last night,

00:46.838 --> 00:49.631
and my taste buds practically exploded!

00:49.656 --> 00:51.708
(both chuckle)

00:51.922 --> 00:53.322
Hey, look at that.

00:54.642 --> 00:56.165
It's gotta feel good.

00:56.579 --> 00:58.048
It really does.

00:58.501 --> 01:01.618
Did you hear Dean Peterson resigned?

01:01.653 --> 01:03.053
They said he had an opportunity

01:03.088 --> 01:05.956
in the private sector, but
we all know what that means.

01:05.991 --> 01:08.959
Yeah, they're finally
taking us seriously.

01:08.994 --> 01:11.476
There's a lot of work still to be done,

01:11.501 --> 01:14.264
but things are starting to change.

01:14.967 --> 01:15.966
(Iris sighs)

01:16.001 --> 01:17.934
And then, some things never change.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.628
(Australian accent) G'day, ladies.

01:19.653 --> 01:20.841
Hey, Mingo.

01:20.866 --> 01:22.083
Iris, hey.

01:22.108 --> 01:24.514
- Uh, how are you?
- I'm fine.

01:25.545 --> 01:27.744
I... I hear you're eating again.

01:27.769 --> 01:28.785
You want me to...

01:28.810 --> 01:31.537
throw another shrimp
on the barby for ya?

01:32.918 --> 01:34.884
I have to get to BSU.

01:35.099 --> 01:36.585
I'll see you later.

01:39.858 --> 01:41.155
You okay?

01:41.405 --> 01:42.759
Yeah, of course.

01:42.794 --> 01:45.905
It's only my favorite day
of the whole damn year.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.839
- The Kangaroo Krawl?
- It's an all-day pub crawl.

01:48.867 --> 01:50.535
We go to the best 12 bars,

01:50.560 --> 01:52.102
drink two beers at each one

01:52.137 --> 01:53.496
all in the name of school spirit.

01:53.521 --> 01:55.672
Totally unsanctioned, of course.

01:55.707 --> 01:56.773
Go Roos.

01:56.808 --> 01:59.075
Last man standing is
crowned Kangaroo King.

01:59.111 --> 02:02.012
Everybody has to buy him his
drinks for the rest of the year.

02:02.047 --> 02:05.439
So, what do you say? You want in?

02:05.464 --> 02:08.872
Oh, pfft, I wish I could,

02:08.898 --> 02:10.997
but Professor Marillo hooked me up

02:11.023 --> 02:13.623
with a volunteer job at
the Student Health Center

02:13.659 --> 02:16.140
for extra credit, so I gotta work.

02:16.165 --> 02:17.507
What, on a Saturday?

02:17.532 --> 02:18.604
Oh, no, I'm excited.

02:18.629 --> 02:21.470
I'm looking forward to
getting back in the trenches.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.835
But, um, hey, we should
hang out next weekend.

02:25.871 --> 02:28.251
Yeah, I'd love that, um...

02:28.807 --> 02:33.062
but I'm actually, uh, going
to Georgetown to see Amy.

02:33.469 --> 02:34.502
Right.

02:35.847 --> 02:39.065
But, uh, best of luck with the new job.

02:39.090 --> 02:40.957
Yeah. Thanks.

02:41.614 --> 02:42.825
See ya.

02:45.534 --> 02:46.699
Toby: I mean, I just figured

02:46.724 --> 02:49.066
with all the millions
of anchors and dragons

02:49.091 --> 02:50.794
that everybody copied off of each other.

02:50.829 --> 02:52.128
No, it's, like, the number one

02:52.164 --> 02:53.958
unwritten rule in the ink world.

02:53.983 --> 02:55.310
Stealing someone else's tattoo

02:55.335 --> 02:57.318
is a sure way to get your ass kicked.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.427
Besides, Noelle represents herself
as being completely original.

03:00.452 --> 03:02.170
She's all about non-conformity.

03:02.195 --> 03:04.327
She never even duplicates her own work.

03:04.616 --> 03:06.767
Well, then I'd say you've got a problem,

03:06.803 --> 03:09.103
because these look awfully similar.

03:09.891 --> 03:11.791
What am I gonna do?

03:11.920 --> 03:14.954
Well, I guess it's like you said,

03:15.302 --> 03:17.123
you gotta kick her ass.

03:19.148 --> 03:21.248
Nurse Reed: <i>Now, I need to
remind you, as a volunteer,</i>

03:21.273 --> 03:23.050
you are not allowed to touch patients.

03:23.086 --> 03:24.118
Of course. I understand.

03:24.153 --> 03:26.695
You're here to observe and
assist the physician on duty.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.607
In this case, Dr. Jackson.

03:28.632 --> 03:30.421
Sorry, did you say Dr. Jackson?

03:30.446 --> 03:32.026
Mm-hmm. He runs a free clinic downtown

03:32.061 --> 03:34.617
- and fills in for us on Saturdays.
- (door opens)

03:34.642 --> 03:35.863
There he is.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.835
Dr. Jackson: <i>Daphne, Daphne!</i>

03:39.860 --> 03:41.045
Go to the drug lockup.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.632
<i>Get me a tetanus vial and syringe.</i>

03:42.657 --> 03:44.703
<i>No oxycodone was prescribed yesterday,</i>

03:44.728 --> 03:46.335
<i>nor the day before. Did you take it?</i>

03:46.360 --> 03:48.140
I will never do
anything like that again.

03:48.165 --> 03:49.631
I can't tolerate stealing.

03:49.656 --> 03:51.879
I have to let you go.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.751

04:03.602 --> 04:06.266
Are you seriously trying to
front like I ripped you off?

04:06.291 --> 04:07.940
All I'm saying is that
they look pretty similar.

04:07.972 --> 04:09.539
So what? You're my apprentice.

04:09.574 --> 04:10.946
- What's yours is mine.
- What?

04:10.971 --> 04:12.608
Says who? I've never even heard of that.

04:12.644 --> 04:15.228
One of the many reasons you're
an apprentice and not an artist.

04:15.253 --> 04:17.531
"Many reasons"? What reasons?

04:17.557 --> 04:19.548
First of all, you're
not from around here,

04:19.584 --> 04:20.683
and it shows.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.300
Actually, half of my family
is from East Riverside.

04:23.325 --> 04:25.847
Really? Well, I grew up
here, went to school here.

04:25.872 --> 04:28.131
My first job was at Sam's Thrift Store

04:28.156 --> 04:29.872
on Hamilton Avenue. Do you know it?

04:30.695 --> 04:31.928
Didn't think so.

04:31.963 --> 04:32.962
And sadly,

04:32.997 --> 04:35.598
your rich girl vibe
is cramping my style.

04:35.906 --> 04:38.187
You know what, if I am
good enough to steal from,

04:38.212 --> 04:39.750
then I'm good enough
to have my own chair.

04:39.775 --> 04:42.399
- You really think you're ready?
- I know I'm ready.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.216
Okay.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.377
Congratulations, you've got one.

04:49.188 --> 04:51.048
Wow. Thank you...

04:51.073 --> 04:53.824
The rental fee is 300 bucks every week.

04:54.143 --> 04:55.826
- Every week?
- Every Friday.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.129
Anything you make
beyond that, I get 20%.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.620
- Got it.
- And let's be clear,

05:00.645 --> 05:03.144
if you can't score any clients
or don't make any money,

05:03.169 --> 05:04.802
you still owe me 300 bucks a week.

05:04.837 --> 05:06.993
Oh, and when it comes to clients,

05:07.018 --> 05:08.908
don't even think about pinching mine.

05:12.392 --> 05:13.778
So your name and date,

05:13.813 --> 05:15.493
and make sure you list any allergies.

05:15.518 --> 05:17.228
That's really important.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.675
Miss Vasquez.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.973
I'd forgotten you were
going to school here.

05:25.998 --> 05:28.746
- Hi, Dr. Jackson.
- So, you're our student volunteer?

05:29.473 --> 05:30.692
I know what you're gonna say,

05:30.717 --> 05:31.829
that you don't want to work with me,

05:31.864 --> 05:33.764
but I just want you to
know that I got my life...

05:33.800 --> 05:35.132
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.196
You've got the wrong idea.

05:37.221 --> 05:39.356
It's good to see you.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.806
But you fired me.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.014
Well, you didn't really
give me a choice about that.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.754
Doesn't mean I liked it.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.371
You were going through a hard time.

05:47.396 --> 05:49.213
You just lost your father.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.182
Angelo was it?

05:51.217 --> 05:52.850
And now look at you.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.256
You're pre-med.

05:54.281 --> 05:56.181
I'm sure he'd be very proud.

05:57.788 --> 05:59.497
- Thank you.
- So, let's move on.

05:59.522 --> 06:03.194
Now, tell me what you know
about this Kangaroo Krawl.

06:03.577 --> 06:05.442
It's a bunch of guys

06:05.467 --> 06:07.849
trying to out-drink
each other all day long.

06:07.874 --> 06:10.034
I have a feeling we're gonna be slammed.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.357
I need you to bring your "A" game.

06:15.513 --> 06:17.074
<i>(sultry music playing)</i>

06:18.208 --> 06:20.013
- (doorknob rattles)
- Hey, honey.

06:20.038 --> 06:21.145
Hey, hey.

06:21.170 --> 06:23.003
- What do you want for lunch?
- (music stops)

06:23.529 --> 06:25.207
I thought you went to the store.

06:25.232 --> 06:27.504
I did, and I'm back.

06:27.529 --> 06:29.329
Okay.

06:29.364 --> 06:31.693
- Did I interrupt something?
- Ha! No, no, no, no.

06:31.718 --> 06:34.833
I just, you know, I...
just checkin' scores, yeah.

06:35.712 --> 06:36.952
Huh. Okay, lunch.

06:36.977 --> 06:38.243
Tuna salad or BLT?

06:38.268 --> 06:39.901
Tuna salad! Great!

06:39.926 --> 06:41.557
Tuna salad it is.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.113
So given the current profit margin

06:49.138 --> 06:51.565
and the fact that we can
amortize some of the costs

06:51.590 --> 06:53.963
of running one location
by opening another,

06:53.988 --> 06:56.902
all the numbers seem to
point in the same direction.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.293
Expansion.

07:00.633 --> 07:01.676
I love it.

07:01.701 --> 07:04.445
Duplicate your profits,
duplicate your success.

07:04.470 --> 07:06.012
It's a solid plan.

07:06.037 --> 07:09.324
Good, because I've already made
an appointment with the bank

07:09.349 --> 07:11.871
to talk about a small business loan.

07:14.031 --> 07:15.164
What?

07:15.189 --> 07:18.061
I may be able to help you
get there a little faster.

07:18.217 --> 07:19.952
Really? How?

07:19.977 --> 07:21.850
Uh, I know a private investor

07:21.875 --> 07:23.293
who might be interested
in getting involved.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.444
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

07:25.469 --> 07:27.436
Yeah, he's been looking
for smart investments,

07:27.461 --> 07:30.041
and I think your business
plan is exactly that.

07:30.455 --> 07:32.424
Want me to get into it?

07:32.635 --> 07:35.142
That would be amazing!

07:35.167 --> 07:36.541
Thank you!

07:37.003 --> 07:38.092
Aw.

07:38.823 --> 07:40.639
- You got it.
- (chuckles)

07:42.000 --> 07:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:52.428 --> 07:54.303
Wow. (clears throat)

07:54.328 --> 07:56.128
That is delicious!

07:56.856 --> 07:58.689
What'd you put in there?

07:58.714 --> 08:00.647
Tuna and mayonnaise.

08:00.672 --> 08:02.199
Same as always.

08:02.224 --> 08:05.125
Well, it's just... fantastic.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.495
It's better today.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.574
(chewing loudly)

08:07.599 --> 08:09.183
Okay, John, we're not doing this.

08:09.503 --> 08:10.714
Not doing what?

08:10.739 --> 08:13.363
We have been married for 25 years.

08:13.388 --> 08:17.120
We should be able to have an
adult conversation about sex.

08:17.186 --> 08:19.613
Honey, I'm not judging you.

08:19.951 --> 08:22.636
It's important to have
an active fantasy life.

08:22.644 --> 08:24.578
I'm a herotica novel author.

08:24.613 --> 08:27.234
I literally wrote a book about it.

08:27.812 --> 08:29.328
Okay.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.515
Maybe you interrupted
something private...

08:33.655 --> 08:35.547
and if you insist on talking about it,

08:35.572 --> 08:36.623
we can talk about it.

08:36.658 --> 08:37.924
Okay.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.304
Good.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.859
So...

08:42.258 --> 08:44.413
what kinds of things
were you looking at?

08:47.039 --> 08:48.755
I take it back. I can't do this.

08:48.780 --> 08:51.077
(sighs) I... I just want you to know...

08:51.102 --> 08:53.811
You're reading way too much
into this, sweetie, okay?

08:53.836 --> 08:55.444
We've both been really busy.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.780
You got that new job...

08:56.805 --> 08:59.556
What does that have to do with it?

09:00.472 --> 09:01.566
You have to have noticed

09:01.591 --> 09:03.526
we both have not had
much time for each other.

09:03.551 --> 09:04.815
Of course I have.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.620
I was just, you know, waiting it out.

09:06.645 --> 09:08.932
Right! Summer's coming and, you know,

09:08.957 --> 09:10.893
we'll get back into the swing of things.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.011
John, it's April.

09:15.149 --> 09:18.232
Can we please just not
talk about this right now?

09:27.782 --> 09:30.321
I'm Dr. Jackson and
this is Daphne Vasquez,

09:30.346 --> 09:32.235
our student volunteer.

09:32.359 --> 09:33.925
Hi there.

09:33.950 --> 09:35.133
Hey.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.626
I'm Ally.

09:37.078 --> 09:38.977
I'm just a part-time
student. Is that okay?

09:39.002 --> 09:40.618
Yeah, all students are covered.

09:40.643 --> 09:42.922
Ouch. How'd that happen?

09:42.947 --> 09:45.396
This guy came out of nowhere
covered in spikes and chains

09:45.421 --> 09:47.169
like an extra from a <i>Mad Max</i> movie.

09:47.194 --> 09:49.394
Yet another victim
of the Kangaroo Krawl.

09:49.419 --> 09:51.667
And that's gonna need stitches.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.856
Uh, and I don't see a temperature.

09:53.881 --> 09:55.489
Why don't you go ahead and take it?

09:55.525 --> 09:57.067
Uh, the nurse said I couldn't...

09:57.092 --> 09:59.860
As long as I'm supervising, it's fine.

10:00.852 --> 10:03.077
Don't worry, you're in good hands.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.171
The patient's had open heart surgery

10:05.196 --> 10:06.702
and is still on blood thinners,

10:06.727 --> 10:08.049
so what do we do?

10:08.074 --> 10:11.609
Um, we use an adhesive
after stitches to...

10:11.634 --> 10:14.171
- prevent further bleeding.
- Mm-hmm. Very good.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.765
I learned from the best.

10:15.790 --> 10:18.005
- 98.6.
- Excellent.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.930
We'll have you out of here in a second.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.952
You know, this isn't the kind of thread

10:37.977 --> 10:39.444
I like to use.

10:39.669 --> 10:42.178
Uh, Daphne, will you ask
the nurse practitioner

10:42.203 --> 10:44.103
to come in and finish up?

10:44.128 --> 10:45.573
Of course.

10:53.394 --> 10:55.260
Ally's all stitched up.

10:55.296 --> 10:57.262
- She's good to go.
- Great.

10:57.297 --> 11:00.040
Well, let's get her back here
in a week and take them out.

11:00.065 --> 11:02.173
Dr. Jackson, is everything okay?

11:02.653 --> 11:04.586
- What do you mean?
- I just...

11:04.697 --> 11:06.237
your hands.

11:06.272 --> 11:07.469
Oh, that.

11:07.494 --> 11:10.719
Um, I forgot to take my arthritis pills.

11:10.744 --> 11:12.143
When you get to be my age,

11:12.178 --> 11:15.079
your medicine cabinet
looks like a candy store.

11:18.151 --> 11:19.560
Oh, no.

11:21.271 --> 11:22.509
Hey.

11:22.534 --> 11:23.800
What happened?

11:23.825 --> 11:26.457
Uh, you know, we were
leaving the Loosey Goosey

11:26.492 --> 11:28.392
and somebody got out a rugby ball.

11:28.428 --> 11:29.896
Uh...

11:30.063 --> 11:31.778
that looks like it could be dislocated.

11:31.803 --> 11:32.966
Does it hurt a lot?

11:32.991 --> 11:35.747
No, it's not that bad, actually.

11:35.872 --> 11:37.670
How many beers have you've had?

11:37.695 --> 11:39.914
In pints or schooners?

11:39.939 --> 11:42.555
Okay, let's get you into an exam room.

11:42.580 --> 11:43.959
Ooh, look at us,

11:43.984 --> 11:45.795
back at the scene of the crime.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.117
Remember? First date,

11:47.142 --> 11:48.289
- where we lost the, you know...
- Oh, I remember.

11:48.314 --> 11:49.313
- ... in the...
- Yeah, no, shh.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.038
- Mingo, just...
- All I'm saying is, this place

11:51.063 --> 11:52.834
- should give me a punch card.
- I'm... I'm working.

11:53.253 --> 11:55.353
So you're talking about a
cross-hatching detail like this.

11:55.388 --> 11:58.289
Yes, exactly, but I'll come back
tomorrow with one of my boys.

11:58.324 --> 11:59.357
I wanna see if they think it's dope.

11:59.392 --> 12:00.491
Uh, can I be honest?

12:00.516 --> 12:02.149
Uh, this is your tattoo.

12:02.174 --> 12:04.429
It only matters if you think it's dope,

12:04.454 --> 12:06.024
and I can see it in your eyes.

12:06.049 --> 12:07.582
- You love it.
- (chuckles)

12:07.690 --> 12:09.773
Yeah, you're right. Uh,
you... you have time right now?

12:09.798 --> 12:12.003
Uh, yeah, I think I can fit you in.

12:12.038 --> 12:13.671
- (chuckles)
- Kathryn: Hi, honey!

12:13.696 --> 12:15.183
John: Hey, there she is!

12:15.208 --> 12:17.108
We just got your text,
and we wanted to come by

12:17.143 --> 12:18.175
and congratulate you in person.

12:18.211 --> 12:19.326
First day with your own chair,

12:19.351 --> 12:21.310
- that's a big deal!
- (shutter clicks)

12:21.514 --> 12:23.114
- Your first day?
- No!

12:23.149 --> 12:25.416
Well, yes. Just...

12:25.451 --> 12:27.990
Can you guys hold on just one second?

12:28.154 --> 12:29.627
Um, yes.

12:29.652 --> 12:31.422
It is my first day here
at Bombshell Betty's,

12:31.448 --> 12:35.024
but before this, I was an
established tattoo artist in China.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.644
I've inked hundreds of people.

12:36.669 --> 12:39.121
I... I just realized I...
I'm expecting a delivery

12:39.146 --> 12:41.294
and I gotta sign for it. I'll come back.

12:43.184 --> 12:44.349
[gasps]

12:44.374 --> 12:45.480
Kathryn: Oh, hello!

12:45.505 --> 12:47.678
- You must be Noelle.
- Mom, please don't.

12:47.703 --> 12:50.274
Hi, I'm Kathryn Kennish. I'm Bay's mom.

12:50.309 --> 12:52.609
Hey, John Kennish.
Got a great place here.

12:52.634 --> 12:54.344
It's so nice to meet you.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.213
Where do you guys live again?

12:56.248 --> 12:58.348
- Mission Hills.
- Oh, wow.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.117
I hear it's beautiful over there.

13:00.152 --> 13:03.120
We like it. I love your
wallpaper. It's so cool.

13:03.155 --> 13:04.254
Honey, our reservation's in 10 minutes.

13:04.290 --> 13:05.817
We should probably go.

13:05.842 --> 13:07.842
- Oh, it's our date night.
- Oh.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.833
Um, okay, thanks for coming by, guys.

13:09.858 --> 13:11.153
- See you later. Appreciate it.
- Bye, honey.

13:11.178 --> 13:12.195
- John: Bye.
- Bay: Bye. Okay.

13:12.231 --> 13:14.169
We're so proud of her.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.567
(laughs dryly)

13:16.655 --> 13:19.716
Now, which one of them
is from East Riverside?

13:21.347 --> 13:23.622
(groans, chuckles)

13:24.896 --> 13:27.754
Admit it, you miss these guns.

13:27.779 --> 13:30.414
- (crack)
- (yelps, grunts)

13:30.449 --> 13:31.448
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:31.483 --> 13:32.966
Good, good.

13:32.991 --> 13:34.051
Ow.

13:34.086 --> 13:35.452
All right, you're gonna
be sore for a while.

13:35.487 --> 13:37.387
- You think?
- I'm gonna give you a painkiller

13:37.423 --> 13:39.022
and an anti-inflammatory,

13:39.058 --> 13:41.764
but don't take them
until you've sobered up.

13:42.213 --> 13:45.373
Now go home and take it
easy for the rest of the day.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.856
Do you want some help
getting back to the dorm?

13:53.963 --> 13:55.963
I'm not going back to the dorm.

13:55.988 --> 13:57.625
It's down to me and the last five guys.

13:57.650 --> 13:59.845
Mingo, you could've
seriously hurt yourself.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.483
It's crazy out there.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.678
It's only gonna get worse.

14:02.703 --> 14:04.389
Okay, spare me the lecture, Red.

14:04.414 --> 14:07.014
You know, not all of us
want to work all the time.

14:07.039 --> 14:08.710
College is supposed to be fun.

14:08.746 --> 14:10.579
You're taking it too far.

14:10.614 --> 14:12.384
Yeah, 'cause that's what I do, right?

14:12.409 --> 14:15.095
That's who I am. I'm the party guy.

14:15.282 --> 14:18.032
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna win this damn thing.

14:21.374 --> 14:22.890
Mingo, wait!

14:30.804 --> 14:32.015
There you go.

14:35.691 --> 14:37.450
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:37.686 --> 14:39.153
So many choices.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.211
Well, if you ask me,
they're all delicious,

14:41.247 --> 14:42.865
but I'm biased.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.586
Latte with soy.

14:44.621 --> 14:46.922
Can I request a specific mug?

14:46.958 --> 14:48.170
That's the whole idea.

14:48.195 --> 14:49.787
I'll take the one with the surfboard.

14:49.812 --> 14:52.318
Ah, my favorite in
the entire collection.

14:52.343 --> 14:55.311
It's from a sleepy little
surfing town called Sayulita.

14:55.336 --> 14:56.584
You can watch the fishermen

14:56.608 --> 14:58.542
bring in their haul
at the end of the day,

14:58.577 --> 15:00.197
sit right down on the beach,

15:00.222 --> 15:02.089
and watch them peel your shrimp for you.

15:02.114 --> 15:04.381
The most amazing <i>paletas</i> in the world.

15:04.650 --> 15:05.946
You've been there?

15:05.971 --> 15:07.696
Well, I'm from Nayarit.

15:07.721 --> 15:09.419
Oh. (chuckles)

15:09.454 --> 15:12.024
God, why did you let me go on like that?

15:12.049 --> 15:14.008
(chuckles) Can you blame me?

15:14.033 --> 15:17.194
A pretty woman telling me how
much she likes my home state?

15:19.147 --> 15:20.330
<i>A Sayulita.</i>

15:20.365 --> 15:21.694
<i>A Sayulita.</i>

15:24.540 --> 15:25.757
You're early.

15:25.782 --> 15:27.270
- You're never early.
- (chuckles)

15:27.306 --> 15:28.863
There's always a first.

15:28.888 --> 15:30.788
You two know each other?

15:31.859 --> 15:34.162
Regina, this is Manuel.

15:35.943 --> 15:37.180
My father.

15:40.780 --> 15:42.068
Hi.

15:46.959 --> 15:49.997
Why didn't you tell me you
were meeting your dad here?

15:50.022 --> 15:51.355
This wasn't the plan.

15:51.390 --> 15:53.023
I was gonna tell you
everything beforehand,

15:53.059 --> 15:54.325
but he got here first.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.818
You could've texted me!

15:55.843 --> 15:56.950
I'm sorry.

15:56.975 --> 15:58.598
Okay? I... I told him
about the Cracked Mug

15:58.623 --> 15:59.849
as a possible investment.

15:59.874 --> 16:01.530
- He wanted to see it right away.
- Wait,

16:01.555 --> 16:03.920
your dad is the investor?

16:03.945 --> 16:05.911
We really should've
talked about this first.

16:05.947 --> 16:09.379
I... I don't even know
how he feels about us.

16:09.717 --> 16:11.479
Well, the thing is, I haven't...

16:11.504 --> 16:13.542
exactly told him we're dating.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.419
- Why not?
- I didn't want it to cloud his judgment

16:15.444 --> 16:16.645
about your business plan.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.987
- Well, he's gonna find out eventually.
- No, of course he will,

16:19.012 --> 16:21.026
but first I want him to
form an unbiased opinion,

16:21.051 --> 16:24.129
and once he's done that,
I'll tell him all about us.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.809
I... I really don't
feel good about this.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.768
I need you to trust me.

16:28.803 --> 16:32.142
Look, you asked me to keep our
relationship a secret from your family

16:32.167 --> 16:34.000
until you felt the time was right.

16:34.025 --> 16:36.518
Now I'm asking for the same in return.

16:37.023 --> 16:38.284
All right.

16:42.650 --> 16:45.705
Bay: I'm... so sorry,
Noelle's booked then.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.229
Um...

16:47.970 --> 16:49.642
You know, we have another artist

16:49.667 --> 16:51.970
who just started working here, if y...

16:52.111 --> 16:54.378
You want Noelle.

16:54.403 --> 16:55.853
I get it.

16:55.878 --> 16:57.345
Thanks. Bye.

16:58.399 --> 17:00.158
Uh, hi. Can I help you?

17:00.183 --> 17:02.158
Yeah, I'm looking to get a tattoo.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.659
Okay.

17:03.684 --> 17:05.780
Great. Well, do you want to
check out some of our portfolios,

17:05.805 --> 17:07.296
get some inspiration?

17:07.320 --> 17:09.154
No, I... I know what I want.

17:11.992 --> 17:13.130
Hm!

17:13.155 --> 17:15.381
- It's nice.
- My dad had the same one.

17:15.406 --> 17:17.608
Growing up, he always
told me stories about it.

17:18.890 --> 17:20.856
He died in Iraq.

17:21.002 --> 17:22.957
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:23.037 --> 17:24.652
I've been thinking about
this for a long time,

17:24.676 --> 17:27.237
and I want it in the
same place he had it.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.637
Uh... okay.

17:29.662 --> 17:31.160
Y... I need to see some I.D.

17:31.185 --> 17:32.354
You have to be 18.

17:32.379 --> 17:34.129
I'm 18. I got I.D.

17:37.547 --> 17:39.896
Says here you're 250 pounds.

17:39.921 --> 17:41.787
I lost a lot of weight.

17:42.548 --> 17:44.795
Look, I... I'll pay cash.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.521
Whatever you charge.

17:49.105 --> 17:50.663
(sighs)

17:53.369 --> 17:54.883
Okay, let's set you up.

17:55.664 --> 17:57.731
All the couches and tables

17:57.756 --> 17:59.783
are from local East
Riverside manufacturers.

17:59.808 --> 18:01.082
Dad, I actually gotta run.

18:01.107 --> 18:03.495
Um, Regina can answer your questions.

18:03.810 --> 18:06.679
- Is that cool?
- Go. I'll call you later.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.287
- Bye, Regina.
- Bye, Luca.

18:09.312 --> 18:10.850
Thank you for everything.

18:11.748 --> 18:13.775
The vibe in here is very comfortable.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.221
People must stay all day.

18:15.246 --> 18:16.744
Isn't that bad for profits?

18:16.769 --> 18:19.658
Well, long-term loyalty is
better than short-term profits.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.667
I mean, that's what I've found.

18:21.692 --> 18:24.660
I understand why Luca sees so
much potential in this place.

18:24.685 --> 18:25.931
Thank you.

18:25.967 --> 18:27.572
I'm gonna take your
proposal home with me

18:27.597 --> 18:29.134
and have a closer look at the numbers.

18:29.159 --> 18:31.747
Please. That would be great.

18:31.772 --> 18:33.126
Uh...

18:34.159 --> 18:36.634
I hope I'm not being too forward, but...

18:37.401 --> 18:39.301
I'd love to take you to dinner.

18:40.409 --> 18:41.475
Oh.

18:41.510 --> 18:43.284
- Uh...
- Oh.

18:43.309 --> 18:44.478
(chuckles)

18:44.513 --> 18:46.413
I'm sorry, I overstepped.

18:46.448 --> 18:47.972
I'm a little rusty at this.

18:47.997 --> 18:50.801
I haven't dated much since my wife died.

18:51.179 --> 18:53.901
No, I'm sorry, um...

18:53.926 --> 18:56.223
Gosh. This is...

18:57.163 --> 19:00.293
I'm actually dating your son.

19:02.231 --> 19:03.491
Oh.

19:04.968 --> 19:07.293
I'm sorry. Um, we
should've told you earlier.

19:07.336 --> 19:11.257
I just think Luca wanted to get
your unbiased opinion of the place.

19:11.945 --> 19:13.265
Right.

19:13.421 --> 19:15.898
And even if I was single,

19:15.923 --> 19:17.257
I don't think it would be appropriate

19:17.282 --> 19:19.506
to mix business with pleasure.

19:20.249 --> 19:21.448
I don't understand.

19:22.037 --> 19:25.693
Well, you're thinking of investing
in my business, aren't you?

19:27.648 --> 19:30.725
My son hasn't been
honest with either of us.

19:31.162 --> 19:32.766
I'm not the investor.

19:32.791 --> 19:34.491
Luca is.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.006
Change the dressing in three hours.

19:40.031 --> 19:42.479
More ointment and then re-cover, okay?

19:42.504 --> 19:44.371
Yeah. Thanks.

19:47.024 --> 19:49.420
Hey, anything blow up while I was away?

19:49.593 --> 19:51.484
- What's up?
- That's 300.

19:51.509 --> 19:53.375
My week already paid in full.

19:59.939 --> 20:01.064
(doorknob rattles)

20:01.719 --> 20:03.130
Hey, Dr. J.

20:03.155 --> 20:05.796
Uh, this prescription you
wrote for Greg Shamingo,

20:05.821 --> 20:08.228
isn't Ketalar an anesthetic?

20:08.263 --> 20:11.306
- I didn't give him Ketalar.
- I gave him ketorolac.

20:16.338 --> 20:18.238
Um, good catch.

20:18.263 --> 20:20.273
I'll write your friend
a new prescription.

20:20.309 --> 20:22.609
Mingo could have ended
up in the hospital.

20:22.645 --> 20:24.137
It's a common mistake.

20:24.162 --> 20:26.246
Now come on, we've got
a ton of patients to see.

20:26.281 --> 20:28.649
But Dr. J, if something's
affecting your abilities...

20:28.684 --> 20:30.285
Then what?

20:30.609 --> 20:33.654
Then... y... you need to...

20:33.689 --> 20:35.933
I don't know, talk to someone.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.624
Okay, now you're out of line.

20:37.660 --> 20:40.191
See, I made one mistake.
It's not the end of the world.

20:40.216 --> 20:42.652
And you of all people
should understand that.

20:49.552 --> 20:53.504
Sounds to me like Dr. J
should be thanking you.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.090
Yeah. I mean, it's a good thing

20:55.115 --> 20:57.573
that you were there
to catch his mistake.

20:57.598 --> 21:00.050
He's right. What if it happens again

21:00.075 --> 21:02.411
and someone really does gets hurt?

21:03.356 --> 21:05.289
He could've told everyone

21:05.325 --> 21:07.170
about what I did at the clinic.

21:07.195 --> 21:09.964
He could've ended my medical
career right then and there,

21:09.989 --> 21:13.323
and now, I might be the one ending his.

21:14.353 --> 21:15.994
Maybe not.

21:16.151 --> 21:19.138
You know, when I decided
to be a stay-at-home dad,

21:19.173 --> 21:23.609
I thought that I was
saying goodbye to music.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.083
But, you know, Carlton and I,

21:26.108 --> 21:27.480
we go into the studio

21:27.515 --> 21:29.898
and we just jam, and...

21:30.518 --> 21:32.228
he totally loves it.

21:33.595 --> 21:36.489
And I know it's not exactly
the same thing, but...

21:36.524 --> 21:38.814
But you're still playing your music.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.806
You're still doing what you love.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.241
Exactly.

21:47.064 --> 21:48.539
Announcer on TV: <i>67 seconds</i>

21:48.564 --> 21:50.369
<i>- to make up two points.</i>
- Gotta make that.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.673
<i>Have three guys that can
shoot the basketball...</i>

21:52.698 --> 21:54.048
<i>It's go time! Can they...</i>

21:54.072 --> 21:56.595
Hey! What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

21:57.528 --> 22:01.173
I've got something
better for you to look at.

22:01.198 --> 22:02.888
Wow.

22:02.924 --> 22:04.735
You don't think I was
gonna let our date night end

22:04.760 --> 22:06.853
with you falling asleep on the couch?

22:06.878 --> 22:10.009
Ooh. Well, you know, I...

22:10.688 --> 22:12.525
Wow. (chuckles)

22:12.550 --> 22:14.704
Hey, sweetie, look, you know,
wait, we gotta be careful.

22:14.729 --> 22:16.509
The kids could walk in.

22:16.534 --> 22:17.813
Nope, nobody's here.

22:17.838 --> 22:20.187
I made sure that we have
the house to ourselves

22:20.212 --> 22:22.562
for the next two hours.

22:22.587 --> 22:26.555
Listen, sweetie, I really want
to watch this game. It's... mm!

22:26.580 --> 22:28.113
It's Big Ten Pac-12.

22:28.149 --> 22:29.352
Record it.

22:29.377 --> 22:31.835
But it's not the same as live.

22:33.087 --> 22:35.154
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

22:35.189 --> 22:36.689
Now I know why you felt

22:36.724 --> 22:38.157
the need to do your independent study.

22:38.192 --> 22:39.460
Oh, no, no. Wait a second!

22:39.485 --> 22:41.568
- No, that's not it!
- I'm throwing myself at you,

22:41.593 --> 22:43.404
and you would rather watch TV.

22:43.507 --> 22:47.032
O... okay, look, Kathryn, I...

22:47.696 --> 22:49.335
lately, I've...

22:49.360 --> 22:52.148
I... I've been having
a little trouble...

22:52.601 --> 22:54.537
with my equipment.

22:54.562 --> 22:55.749
Equipment?

22:57.945 --> 22:59.812
- Oh.
- When you walked in on me,

22:59.847 --> 23:01.847
I was just looking at
things, thinking that maybe

23:01.882 --> 23:03.882
I could jump-start
the engine. That's it.

23:03.918 --> 23:06.030
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- No, please. Don't do that, please.

23:06.055 --> 23:07.558
No pity. I have a plan.

23:07.583 --> 23:09.023
I am gonna start eating more salads,

23:09.058 --> 23:10.527
I wanna start swimming again,

23:10.552 --> 23:12.308
I wanna get the blood pumping.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.347
And you're gonna see Dr. Hughes, right?

23:15.278 --> 23:17.311
- Um...
- What?

23:17.336 --> 23:18.866
Sweetie, he's a doctor. Okay?

23:18.901 --> 23:20.422
He'll just want to give me pills.

23:20.447 --> 23:23.468
- This can work itself out.
- Let me get this straight,

23:23.493 --> 23:25.773
you're having performance issues,

23:25.798 --> 23:28.732
which you were all too happy
to blame on my new job...

23:28.757 --> 23:30.244
which is not okay, by the way...

23:30.279 --> 23:32.693
and you won't do what
you need to do to fix it

23:32.718 --> 23:34.883
because you're gonna have
to talk to another man

23:34.908 --> 23:36.445
about your sexual problems?

23:36.480 --> 23:38.047
I told you, I am handling this.

23:38.072 --> 23:40.522
Newsflash, John, you're getting older.

23:40.547 --> 23:41.687
We both are.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.334
I crank the air conditioning
down to 65 degrees every night

23:44.359 --> 23:46.318
because I'm having hot flashes.

23:46.343 --> 23:49.244
It's called menopause.

23:50.199 --> 23:52.504
And unlike you, I can say things.

23:52.529 --> 23:54.132
Out loud.

23:55.238 --> 23:56.911
We're both changing,

23:56.936 --> 23:59.073
but I'm the one standing
here in a nightgown.

23:59.108 --> 24:01.075
You decide what's more important:

24:01.110 --> 24:04.895
your fragile male ego or our marriage.

24:08.356 --> 24:09.950
Luca: When my mom died,

24:09.986 --> 24:12.987
I inherited her
family's ranch in Mexico.

24:13.022 --> 24:14.989
I sold it off last year.

24:15.024 --> 24:17.057
And my dad advises me
on my business moves,

24:17.093 --> 24:18.773
so I wanted his opinion.

24:18.798 --> 24:20.961
(sighs) Why didn't you ever tell me?

24:20.997 --> 24:24.398
Well, from my experience, it could
change the way some people see me.

24:24.591 --> 24:26.623
- I understand.
- Well, just to be clear,

24:26.656 --> 24:29.114
it's not never-work-again money.

24:29.139 --> 24:31.172
Just enough for a few investments,

24:31.208 --> 24:33.740
which is why I'm
taking business classes.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.332
And very smart.

24:35.520 --> 24:39.371
I know you'll make your mother
and her family very proud.

24:39.396 --> 24:44.051
Well, I happen to think we
will make them very proud.

24:44.087 --> 24:47.355
- Luca...
- Look, I'm ready to do this.

24:47.391 --> 24:49.574
Let's go into business together.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.260
(chuckles) Thank you.

24:53.185 --> 24:54.655
It's...

24:54.680 --> 24:56.913
a lot to think about.

24:56.938 --> 24:59.075
I just need some time
to think it through.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.368
Of course.

25:00.404 --> 25:02.404
I'm just excited.

25:02.538 --> 25:05.545
You know, the potential
here is off the charts.

25:05.588 --> 25:09.241
I mean, just think where we
could be in a few short years.

25:09.784 --> 25:11.146
(sighs)

25:17.753 --> 25:18.919
Noelle: Bay?

25:19.837 --> 25:22.993
You the one who tattooed
my 15-year-old kid?

25:27.110 --> 25:28.680
I am so sorry.

25:28.719 --> 25:32.172
Your son, who by the
way said you were dead,

25:32.197 --> 25:33.977
he also said that he was 18.

25:34.002 --> 25:35.383
I... I checked his I.D.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.459
You know how easy it
is to get a fake I.D.?

25:38.128 --> 25:39.274
Actually, yes, I do.

25:39.299 --> 25:40.572
Sir, it's her first day.

25:40.597 --> 25:41.830
Good for her.

25:41.865 --> 25:43.504
I spent my entire life

25:43.529 --> 25:45.429
trying to keep him from
joining a street gang!

25:45.454 --> 25:48.447
Everyone in the neighborhood
knows and respects that.

25:48.472 --> 25:51.439
Then you go and tattoo a
gang sign right on his arm?

25:51.475 --> 25:52.528
A gang sign?

25:52.553 --> 25:54.489
I wanna know what
you're gonna do about it.

25:55.912 --> 25:57.812
If a rival gang sees this,

25:57.848 --> 25:59.238
he could end up dead!

25:59.263 --> 26:00.910
She can fix it.

26:03.787 --> 26:05.523
Right. I can.

26:05.945 --> 26:07.234
Come on. Sit.

26:09.119 --> 26:11.953
Okay, just hold still.

26:32.816 --> 26:33.893
Okay.

26:37.611 --> 26:39.913
So you can just tattoo that?

26:39.999 --> 26:41.044
Yes.

26:41.069 --> 26:43.139
You will never know
the gang sign was there.

26:44.265 --> 26:45.335
Do it.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.624
Um...

26:48.967 --> 26:50.565
(sighs) Okay.

26:51.795 --> 26:54.608
So Dr. Hughes is going to be in Aruba

26:54.633 --> 26:56.132
for the next three weeks?

26:56.157 --> 26:58.483
Ugh. Yeah, okay.

26:58.934 --> 27:01.155
I... I'll call back. Thank you.

27:01.261 --> 27:03.436
- Coach K.
- Hey.

27:03.577 --> 27:05.796
- You catch the end of that Illini game?
- No.

27:05.821 --> 27:07.834
Their star forward snapped
his Achilles tendon.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.131
Ooh, that is rough.

27:09.156 --> 27:11.089
You know, that's a long recovery period.

27:11.114 --> 27:12.499
Treated a guy in my unit for that.

27:12.524 --> 27:15.400
Took him a year and a half
to get full movement back.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.397
- See ya.
- Yeah, that's right,

27:17.422 --> 27:19.856
you were a medic. Luca?

27:19.881 --> 27:21.530
Hey, hey, listen, I was wondering

27:21.555 --> 27:24.156
if I could get your
advice about something.

27:24.181 --> 27:26.778
- Sure thing.
- Lately...

27:26.803 --> 27:30.805
things have not been
going so smoothly...

27:31.146 --> 27:32.912
down below.

27:34.269 --> 27:37.996
In baseball terms, I've
been in kind of a slump.

27:38.021 --> 27:39.504
Slump?

27:39.529 --> 27:41.090
Imagine stepping up to the plate,

27:41.115 --> 27:44.589
and instead of a nice, solid
piece of wood in your hands,

27:44.614 --> 27:46.654
you're swinging a garden hose.

27:46.690 --> 27:47.689
Got it.

27:47.724 --> 27:49.348
- Thank God.
- (chuckles)

27:49.373 --> 27:51.703
Well, first of all, it
happens all the time.

27:51.728 --> 27:54.596
I mean, not to me, but to lots of guys.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.012
A few of the college guys I know

27:56.037 --> 27:58.324
swear by this herbal supplement.

27:58.349 --> 28:00.349
- Really?
- Yeah! I mean,

28:00.374 --> 28:01.769
when you binge drink as much as they do,

28:01.794 --> 28:04.089
sometimes you need a little
boost to get things going.

28:04.114 --> 28:06.097
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'll text you the name of it.

28:06.122 --> 28:07.472
Thank you so much. That's great.

28:07.497 --> 28:08.780
No problem.

28:10.102 --> 28:11.324
And Luca?

28:12.964 --> 28:15.582
- We take this to our graves.
- (snorts)

28:23.282 --> 28:24.532
(knocks)

28:24.871 --> 28:26.804
What can I do for you?

28:30.720 --> 28:32.204
What's this?

28:32.229 --> 28:34.195
Professor Marillo's email.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.677
She has a lot of sway in
the science department.

28:36.873 --> 28:38.673
And why do I need it?

28:39.718 --> 28:42.990
Sooner or later, you're gonna
hang up your stethoscope,

28:43.037 --> 28:46.145
but it doesn't have to mean
that you're done with medicine.

28:46.817 --> 28:50.590
They're just handing out teaching
positions now, is that it?

28:50.615 --> 28:52.821
I happen to know the
administration is serious

28:52.856 --> 28:54.504
about diversifying the faculty,

28:54.529 --> 28:56.956
and we have adjunct
professors all the time

28:56.981 --> 28:58.879
that don't have half as
much experience as you do.

28:58.917 --> 29:01.573
It's a nice thought, but I'm 75.

29:01.598 --> 29:04.246
You don't start a new career at my age.

29:05.669 --> 29:07.735
"No one's gonna hand you a ladder.

29:07.771 --> 29:10.572
"You want it bad enough,
you gotta build your own."

29:11.499 --> 29:12.975
Did I say that?

29:14.178 --> 29:15.477
Yeah, you did.

29:15.804 --> 29:18.216
Look, I wouldn't be pre-med right now

29:18.241 --> 29:20.175
if it weren't for you.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.843
There are a lot of students here

29:21.868 --> 29:23.945
who need that kind of inspiration.

29:34.154 --> 29:38.089
I guess sometimes you
push a little too hard

29:38.468 --> 29:40.070
when you just want to get back to being

29:40.095 --> 29:42.289
the person you used to be.

29:51.114 --> 29:52.161
Regina: <i>I have to say</i>

29:52.186 --> 29:54.516
I'm shocked he's got money.

29:54.551 --> 29:56.518
Is it possible you're overthinking it?

29:56.553 --> 29:59.341
A young man wants to
invest in your cafe.

29:59.366 --> 30:01.789
I think you should consider it.

30:01.825 --> 30:04.099
But is it weird that he didn't tell me?

30:04.124 --> 30:05.489
If there's one thing I know about men,

30:05.514 --> 30:08.208
it's they all think they
have a good reason to lie.

30:08.233 --> 30:10.716
- (knock on door)
- Oh, hold on.

30:14.905 --> 30:17.206
- Manuel? Hi, come on in.
- Hi.

30:17.231 --> 30:19.333
I'm sorry to just show up.
Luca gave me your address.

30:19.358 --> 30:20.842
I wanted to get these back to you.

30:20.877 --> 30:23.811
Oh, um, Manuel, this is Kathryn.

30:23.847 --> 30:26.434
Kathryn, this is Manuel, Luca's father.

30:26.505 --> 30:27.538
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:27.563 --> 30:29.949
You didn't have to come all this way.

30:29.974 --> 30:32.648
- I was hoping to speak with you.
- Oh.

30:32.673 --> 30:33.755
I think I'll turn in.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.758
- Nice to meet you, Manuel.
- Likewise.

30:37.541 --> 30:41.509
Um, I imagine that you have questions.

30:41.765 --> 30:44.219
Actually, I think
investing in the Cracked Mug

30:44.244 --> 30:45.928
is a smart business decision.

30:45.953 --> 30:47.502
Thank you.

30:47.537 --> 30:50.055
But as a father,

30:50.080 --> 30:53.024
I have very serious concerns
about your relationship.

30:54.326 --> 30:57.860
Well, I'm afraid that's up to Luca.

30:58.193 --> 31:00.922
Luca is my only child.

31:00.947 --> 31:03.294
I want him to have
everything he wants in life...

31:03.414 --> 31:05.213
including a family.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.567
But Luca doesn't want kids.

31:07.592 --> 31:11.105
I'm sure he says that now,
probably believes it too, but...

31:11.130 --> 31:13.403
what happens in five or 10 years

31:13.436 --> 31:15.231
when he changes his mind?

31:15.864 --> 31:17.498
Luca's an adult,

31:17.534 --> 31:20.114
and as an adult, he can
make his own decisions.

31:20.969 --> 31:22.368
That's true.

31:22.888 --> 31:26.848
But I think deep down, you
know I'm right about this.

31:30.665 --> 31:32.168
(door opens)

31:32.681 --> 31:33.913
(door closes)

31:34.851 --> 31:35.850
(students cheering)

31:43.701 --> 31:45.057
Mingo!

31:45.082 --> 31:47.081
(cheering continues)

31:47.276 --> 31:48.495
What are you doing here?

31:48.520 --> 31:50.884
Someone said they saw you
coming up here with your bike.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.032
Yeah.

31:52.057 --> 31:53.801
It's down to me and the
guy who won last year.

31:53.837 --> 31:56.283
Whoever does the craziest stunt wins.

31:56.308 --> 31:57.947
They call this run The Body Bag.

31:57.972 --> 31:59.674
Come on, put your bike down.

31:59.709 --> 32:00.846
You've had way too much to drink.

32:00.871 --> 32:03.136
Are you kidding me? I'm
about to win this thing.

32:03.161 --> 32:05.121
You're about to kill yourself.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.517
You don't understand.

32:10.498 --> 32:12.319
You'd rather have
people think you're crazy

32:12.344 --> 32:14.115
than think you're racist.

32:15.119 --> 32:18.204
Look, I know you're upset
about the Lil Wayne thing,

32:18.229 --> 32:20.595
but this is not the way to get past it.

32:23.058 --> 32:24.891
I'm a little dizzy.

32:25.702 --> 32:26.969
You need to sit down.

32:26.994 --> 32:28.180
Come on.

32:31.755 --> 32:33.574
(students booing)

32:37.888 --> 32:39.630
People hate me.

32:40.227 --> 32:41.226
Not true.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.161
Guys that have known me for three years

32:43.186 --> 32:44.521
cross to the other side of the quad

32:44.546 --> 32:45.853
just so they don't have to talk to me.

32:45.889 --> 32:49.254
And then Iris... I mean, she moved
out of the dorm because of me.

32:49.279 --> 32:51.492
I think an apology might help.

32:51.613 --> 32:54.205
I was trying to.

32:54.230 --> 32:57.269
You asked if she wanted
another shrimp on the barby.

32:57.294 --> 32:59.608
I... I know, I know,
I... I just got nervous.

32:59.633 --> 33:02.007
I wish I could take it all back.

33:02.872 --> 33:04.806
But to Iris and to everybody else,

33:04.841 --> 33:06.421
I'll always just be that racist guy

33:06.446 --> 33:08.515
who dressed up like Lil Wayne.

33:10.469 --> 33:12.299
I don't see you that way.

33:15.435 --> 33:17.463
You're a great guy, Mingo.

33:18.855 --> 33:20.057
Yeah.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.756
So great that when you went to China,

33:21.791 --> 33:24.057
you didn't call me for 10 months.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.662
I thought we weren't talking.

33:27.697 --> 33:28.784
(sighs)

33:29.828 --> 33:32.562
It doesn't mean I didn't miss you.

33:33.693 --> 33:34.807
Really?

33:37.531 --> 33:40.155
I thought about you every single day.

33:59.562 --> 34:01.429
You have a girlfriend.

34:01.464 --> 34:02.563
Maybe I shouldn't.

34:03.457 --> 34:05.152
But you do.

34:06.793 --> 34:08.960
Daphne, you get me.

34:10.051 --> 34:12.380
Like no one ever has.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.435
Are you gonna break up with her?

34:24.661 --> 34:26.650
Then we can't do this.

34:51.928 --> 34:53.914
No charge for the extra work.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.835
And here's your money back.

35:03.865 --> 35:07.005
That was crazy.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.068
Some quick thinking on your part.

35:09.093 --> 35:10.389
- Nice save.
- Thanks.

35:10.414 --> 35:12.616
But seriously, never again.

35:12.641 --> 35:15.124
One, you should've known
that was a gang symbol,

35:15.149 --> 35:17.049
something you learn if you grow up here.

35:17.054 --> 35:19.522
And two, that kid was clearly underage,

35:19.547 --> 35:21.089
no matter what his I.D. said.

35:21.125 --> 35:23.131
Yeah, it was a pretty bad fake.

35:23.774 --> 35:25.141
You knew?

35:25.735 --> 35:27.162
That guy was pissed!

35:27.198 --> 35:29.829
- I mean, he could've had my...
- The pressure got to me.

35:29.854 --> 35:32.034
I needed a client, I
had to get your money.

35:32.069 --> 35:34.790
But I... I crossed a line,

35:34.815 --> 35:37.133
and I'm really, really sorry.

35:39.222 --> 35:40.776
I get it.

35:41.581 --> 35:42.878
You do?

35:43.402 --> 35:44.699
Yeah.

35:44.949 --> 35:47.925
You're in a jam, you needed a way out.

35:47.950 --> 35:49.402
It happens.

35:51.472 --> 35:53.970
Same deal when I borrowed your phoenix.

35:56.882 --> 35:59.212
- But... you said...
- Yeah, look,

35:59.797 --> 36:01.930
it was a crazy, busy day.

36:01.966 --> 36:03.993
The customer wanted
something fresh, and...

36:04.018 --> 36:05.117
I was spent.

36:05.142 --> 36:08.853
I do the five-hour trek back from
Marion every Tuesday before work,

36:08.878 --> 36:12.697
but this time, I was
just... more beat than usual.

36:13.142 --> 36:14.776
What's in Marion?

36:15.636 --> 36:16.740
My nieces.

36:17.295 --> 36:19.264
My deadbeat little
brother's never met them,

36:19.289 --> 36:20.897
but their mum's got her hands full,

36:20.922 --> 36:23.256
so I try to give her a
little break when I can.

36:24.170 --> 36:26.029
That is really cool of you.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.033
Yeah.

36:28.522 --> 36:31.764
Anyway, I'm sorry about your phoenix.

36:31.789 --> 36:34.186
I'm not proud of it, but...

36:35.232 --> 36:37.296
Tuesdays can be tough.

36:39.837 --> 36:41.513
It's okay.

36:42.655 --> 36:44.232
Yeah?

36:47.064 --> 36:48.209
Cool.

36:51.967 --> 36:54.901
But I still need that
300 bucks by Friday.

36:56.418 --> 36:57.481
(sighs)

36:58.069 --> 37:00.403
- Kathryn: Morning.
- John: Hey, sweetie.

37:02.802 --> 37:04.059
You drank all the coffee?

37:04.094 --> 37:05.753
I didn't make coffee.

37:05.778 --> 37:06.778
This is tea.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.378
Since when do you drink tea?

37:08.403 --> 37:09.965
It's an herbal supplement.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.896
Tastes like it came
out of a rain gutter,

37:11.921 --> 37:14.046
but it's supposed to help
with the... (clicks tongue)

37:14.071 --> 37:15.207
you know.

37:15.232 --> 37:17.031
Luca told me about it.

37:18.175 --> 37:20.730
You talked to Luca about it?

37:20.755 --> 37:22.912
- Mm-hmm.
- You told our daughter's

37:22.937 --> 37:25.057
other mother's 25-year-old boy-toy

37:25.082 --> 37:27.246
about our sexual problems?

37:27.271 --> 37:29.171
He's not gonna tell Regina.

37:30.762 --> 37:32.503
- Right?
- He might.

37:32.528 --> 37:34.473
Oh, then I would have to kill him.

37:34.498 --> 37:36.562
Oh, my God, John, you might have to.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.184
(chuckles)

37:38.692 --> 37:39.995
Honestly, thank you.

37:40.030 --> 37:41.930
- Well...
- That couldn't have been easy.

37:42.004 --> 37:43.104
No.

37:43.318 --> 37:44.598
Hey...

37:45.616 --> 37:47.583
remember when you were in the pros,

37:47.837 --> 37:49.938
I used to come visit you on the road,

37:49.973 --> 37:52.806
and we'd hole up in those luxury hotels

37:52.831 --> 37:55.054
with the thousand-thread count sheets?

37:55.079 --> 37:57.493
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

37:57.517 --> 37:59.717
We were unstoppable back then.

37:59.752 --> 38:01.552
Mm-hmm.

38:02.985 --> 38:04.947
Yeah, it was frustrating.

38:06.559 --> 38:09.729
I still feel like I am
that 25-year-old kid...

38:10.720 --> 38:13.658
and then I get in front
of a mirror. (chuckles)

38:13.683 --> 38:15.025
Hey...

38:16.236 --> 38:19.205
I still see that 25-year-old kid.

38:24.893 --> 38:26.993
- Mm.
- Mm.

38:27.761 --> 38:30.185
Oh, my goodness,

38:30.550 --> 38:33.517
we should go see if this tea is working.

38:33.748 --> 38:34.796
Really?

38:35.588 --> 38:38.156
Yeah, 'cause I think it is.

38:39.171 --> 38:40.658
I'll go get the nightgown.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.426
Okay.

38:47.095 --> 38:49.274
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:49.299 --> 38:51.258
I just found out there's a pizza place

38:51.283 --> 38:53.852
two blocks from campus
that's closing down.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.507
- Okay.
- The square footage is right.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.194
It could be perfect
for another Cracked Mug.

38:59.402 --> 39:00.749
Uh...

39:01.709 --> 39:03.609
Come. Let's sit.

39:08.588 --> 39:12.490
I was up all night thinking.

39:14.035 --> 39:16.098
Every time I've gone into business,

39:16.123 --> 39:18.504
I did it with someone else's help.

39:19.532 --> 39:21.634
But this time around,

39:21.659 --> 39:25.196
I think I need to do it by myself.

39:27.219 --> 39:28.327
Oh.

39:28.352 --> 39:31.386
Look, your support and enthusiasm

39:31.411 --> 39:32.843
mean the world to me.

39:32.879 --> 39:37.313
If anything, you pushed me
to actually make this happen.

39:38.227 --> 39:39.450
But...

39:39.766 --> 39:43.615
this time, I need to do it on my own.

39:49.630 --> 39:52.496
Well, I can't say I'm not disappointed.

39:52.970 --> 39:54.700
But, um...

39:57.934 --> 40:00.838
know I'm in your corner
every step of the way.

40:04.462 --> 40:06.062
(footsteps)

40:09.057 --> 40:10.348
Hey.

40:10.394 --> 40:12.799
Um, Ally, right?

40:12.824 --> 40:15.379
Is everything okay?
Did you pop a stitch?

40:15.488 --> 40:17.394
No. Um...

40:18.007 --> 40:19.793
Can I talk to you?

40:21.052 --> 40:22.584
Sure.

40:28.501 --> 40:30.534
(sighs) The thing is...

40:32.872 --> 40:34.526
I know who you are.

40:34.754 --> 40:36.721
I looked you up a while ago.

40:37.577 --> 40:40.315
(sighs) I couldn't believe
we went to the same school,

40:40.340 --> 40:42.722
but I didn't know you
worked at the clinic.

40:44.081 --> 40:45.851
Probably should've said
something yesterday,

40:45.876 --> 40:47.394
but I didn't know how.

40:48.521 --> 40:50.117
I don't understand.

40:52.068 --> 40:54.203
You know I had open heart surgery.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.495
It was actually a heart transplant.
