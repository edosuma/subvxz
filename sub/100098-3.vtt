00:01.080 --> 00:02.080
<i>The Dark Army.</i>

00:02.160 --> 00:03.216
<i>They're following me,</i>

00:03.240 --> 00:04.800
<i>and they're probably
following you, too.</i>

00:05.280 --> 00:07.715
<i>Mr. Alderson needs
to be kept on a short leash</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:10.156
and trained not
to bite his master.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.556
If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

00:12.640 --> 00:14.040
<i>Whiterose loses everything.</i>

00:14.120 --> 00:16.589
<i>You have to have
a contact at the bank.</i>

00:16.680 --> 00:18.751
I need everything
you have on Susan Jacobs.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.256
I'm in, whether
you like it or not.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.478
<i>You want me to request
that the entire Deus Group</i>

00:23.560 --> 00:25.950
<i>gather without
even a pretext?</i>

00:26.040 --> 00:28.430
I'm resigning
as CEO of E Corp.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.319
<i>I played my hand.
Now we wait.</i>

00:31.400 --> 00:32.516
<i>Fernando Vera.</i>

00:32.600 --> 00:34.000
DJ, shoot
the cocksucker.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.936
<i>He showed up at your building
a couple months ago.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:39.792
The CTO position
is worthless.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.395
When the time is right,
we'll expose them.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.513
There's something about this.
I can feel it. I know him.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.256
<i>I actually think he might
have been involved.</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:48.840
<i>- Whiterose?
- Who is she?</i>

00:49.440 --> 00:50.556
<i>Who is Whiterose?</i>

00:50.640 --> 00:52.120
<i>Who is Whiterose?</i>

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
<i>Who is Whiterose?</i>

01:00.480 --> 01:04.872
IBM will pay the shareholders
a cash dividend of 22 Yuan

01:05.000 --> 01:09.392
per depository share and this payment will
bring the total annual cash dividend

01:09.480 --> 01:12.598
to 44 Yuan
per depository share.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.559
And along with our purchase agreement,
we're also willing

01:15.640 --> 01:18.553
to offer your government
a discount on tech licensing fees.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.837
Director Zhang is quite taken
by your generous offer.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.316
Excellent. We look forward to a long
and prosperous partnership.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.750
Uh...

02:00.040 --> 02:01.713
The feeling is mutual.

02:04.240 --> 02:09.520
Thank you, Director Zhang, for paving
the way for IBM's first facility in Asia.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.552
<i>John Carpenter's</i> The Thing.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.597
<i>Now playing in theaters.</i>

03:55.280 --> 03:57.920
<i>USA,
the great American network.</i>

04:37.520 --> 04:38.636
Hmm?

07:46.840 --> 07:49.799
I will be wearing this
the day my project is shipped.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.552
The day we begin to
build a new world.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.278
Please have it
pressed and ready.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.834
Minister Zhang,
it's too early to celebrate.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.276
We have a number
of issues to discuss.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.794
There's Freddy Lomax,

08:05.880 --> 08:09.032
the cartoon character you call
a lawyer who committed suicide.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.758
The person
he met with escaped

08:11.840 --> 08:15.151
after compromising Grand Central's
surveillance system.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.680
And?

08:17.600 --> 08:21.071
Gaining access to Grand Central
is no easy feat.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.710
We've been waiting for Elliot Alderson's
next move and this could be it.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.114
But the fact that
this has coincided

08:27.200 --> 08:29.954
with Phillip Price's
abrupt resignation request...

08:31.000 --> 08:34.038
Well, it's like
you always say,

08:34.720 --> 08:37.599
there is no such thing
as a coincidence.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.715
Very well.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.635
Refuse Price's demands
and keep on digging.

08:45.720 --> 08:49.680
Additionally, keep constant surveillance
on Elliot Alderson.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.314
We will figure this out,
Minister Zhang.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.117
It will just require
some patience.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.040
No.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.559
Minister Zhang?
Did you say something?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.398
Give Phillip Price
what he wants.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.870
I'm sorry?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.870
Let him know that we will
arrange a Deus Group meeting

15:00.000 --> 15:01.275
to confirm a successor.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.831
- But, sir...
- Schedule the meeting for tomorrow.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.070
Tomorrow?

15:05.600 --> 15:08.559
If there's one way
to disrupt a man's plans,

15:08.640 --> 15:11.075
it is to destabilize
his timeline.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.037
If they are indeed
planning something together,

15:14.120 --> 15:16.430
we will not wait for them
to make a mistake.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.839
We will force them
into one.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.512
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.752
There's no way we'll be able to get
the Deus Group together so quickly.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.550
I have been trying to ship
my project to the Congo

15:29.640 --> 15:33.236
for the last 302 days
and counting.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.597
Anything that will disrupt
that will no longer be tolerated.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.469
I have officially
run out of patience.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.637
This rash behavior will only
come back to haunt you.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.200
When Phillip Price resigns,

15:46.280 --> 15:48.317
you will have
no CEO at E Corp...

15:48.400 --> 15:49.754
Wellick.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.070
I'm sorry?

15:53.360 --> 15:56.956
Call Mr. Wellick and
offer him the CEO position.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.190
Tell him you are
speaking for Whiterose.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.315
I have no doubt
that he will accept.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.913
<i>You ever play
Russian Roulette?</i>

16:33.000 --> 16:35.913
<i>They say once you've pulled
that trigger, it changes you.</i>

16:36.000 --> 16:39.994
<i>You can't go back to who you were
before you heard the infamous click,</i>

16:40.080 --> 16:41.958
<i>the sound
of cheating death.</i>

16:42.480 --> 16:44.915
<i>We've been lucky so far,
but I can't shake the feeling</i>

16:45.000 --> 16:47.576
<i>that there's a barrel pointed at us
and we're running out of chances</i>

16:47.600 --> 16:49.956
<i>to get that
empty chamber.</i>

16:50.040 --> 16:54.319
<i>I'm not sure what's taking Vera so long
to come at us with bullets fully loaded.</i>

16:54.400 --> 16:57.996
<i>Every time I try to talk to Elliot
about it, he puts up a wall</i>

16:58.120 --> 17:01.033
<i>like he's flat-out throwing me
a forbidden error,</i>

17:01.120 --> 17:03.555
<i>denying me the chance
to even bring it up.</i>

17:04.520 --> 17:07.160
<i>But Vera's gonna find us
sooner or later,</i>

17:07.240 --> 17:09.835
<i>and I just hope we see him coming
when he does.</i>

17:15.440 --> 17:16.920
Oh, shit.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.069
Krista.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.593
- Give me a second.
- Sure.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.555
I've tried calling you.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.359
Elliot, I thought
I made myself clear.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.557
Yeah, I got your letter.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.233
I just wanted
to talk to you.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.470
You know
that can't happen.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.791
I explained that in the letter
as politely as I could.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.236
You don't understand,
I'm doing better.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.710
I'm finally
talking to Mr. Robot

17:42.800 --> 17:45.793
just like you always
said I should.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.873
We cannot have contact anymore.
Do you understand that?

17:48.960 --> 17:52.636
I just want you to know that I'm
finally making some real progress.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.030
I don't feel safe
around you!

18:09.600 --> 18:10.954
Leave me alone,

18:11.800 --> 18:13.996
or I'll be forced
to take legal action.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.630
I wasn't asking you
to treat me again.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.239
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping me.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.514
You okay?

18:35.800 --> 18:36.800
Yeah.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.074
Olivia Cortez was Susan Jacobs's
contact at Cyprus National Bank.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.070
She's the Deus Group's
only US account manager,

19:01.200 --> 19:03.840
since they wanna make their presence
here as minimal as possible.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.796
She's our way in.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.800
I don't see any
Cyprus National Bank accounts.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.877
You know how these banks make their
lackeys use on-prem work boxes

19:14.960 --> 19:18.032
that are closed loop and
near impossible to exploit remotely.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.760
We'll have to get physical
access to her laptop.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.550
- Kinda makes sense.
- What?

19:29.480 --> 19:31.233
That you made this
your HQ.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.711
It's where it all started.
No better place to plan how it'll end.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.559
It's just
an abandoned office

19:38.640 --> 19:40.472
I knew had
a ten-gig fiber link.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.117
Please. I know you have a soft
spot for this nerd factory.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.960
Where are you going?

19:49.080 --> 19:54.200
Olivia's iCal says her ex-husband's got
her kid tonight and she's got a date.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.796
Should give me enough time to check out
her place and get on her machine.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.554
Whoa! You think I'm your little
research monkey?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.712
We agreed I'd handle
the bank contact

20:03.800 --> 20:05.871
and you'd deal with
the SS7 license.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.873
That was before I knew
we needed physical access.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.155
Now you're gonna stay here
and get the cell service permissions.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.357
No, thanks. I'm gonna stick
with the plan.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.674
You can spend your Christmas Eve
here watching rats fuck.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.998
I'mma go out
and do this B and E.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.518
Will you talk some sense
into her?

20:27.240 --> 20:30.631
Darlene, this is not
your run-of-the-mill break-in.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.951
This is
a Deus Group contact.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.430
Yeah, I get it, dude,
it's dangerous.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.035
But, you know, this whole protective
older brother act's gotten beyond lame.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.919
I'm telling you,
this is too...

20:43.000 --> 20:46.152
Risky? Perilous?
Treacherous?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.119
Hazardous to
my health?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.056
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.230
You're not going.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.277
- You're hurting me.
- I know.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.672
- Is this you or...
- It's me.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.153
What's happening
to you?

21:16.800 --> 21:19.713
You wanted to work with me,
this is the way it is.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.200
If there's a problem,
don't be here when I get back.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.070
And here I thought things
were better after yesterday.

21:28.840 --> 21:33.198
But, as per usual, it's one step forward
and four fucking leaps back.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.715
Nothing's ever gonna
change with you, is it?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.639
No, it's not.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.957
I should've never opened my door
when you came back into town.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.318
<i>There's no word for it,
you know?</i>

22:18.680 --> 22:21.559
<i>There's orphan,
widow, widower.</i>

22:23.880 --> 22:26.111
<i>So, what do you call someone
who's lost everyone?</i>

22:28.320 --> 22:32.792
<i>Mom, dad, sister,
girlfriend, friends.</i>

22:34.200 --> 22:35.554
<i>A survivor?</i>

22:35.640 --> 22:39.111
<i>Or a walking time bomb?</i>

22:40.800 --> 22:43.190
<i>Elliot thinks the more
he restricts everyone's access,</i>

22:43.280 --> 22:44.999
<i>the less vulnerable
he'll be.</i>

22:46.280 --> 22:48.840
<i>But there's a trade-off
that he's forgetting.</i>

22:48.920 --> 22:52.072
<i>If you block everyone, then what's
the point of being here?</i>

22:52.160 --> 22:55.676
<i>Of doing all this?
Of existing?</i>

22:55.760 --> 22:58.514
I'm sure that's her personal,
but check it anyway.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.117
There's nothing on
Cyprus National Bank,

24:39.200 --> 24:42.637
but I've learned more than I wanna know
about this Evan dude she's on a date with.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.712
His name's Evan,
for fuck's sake.

25:02.840 --> 25:03.976
He's into snowboarding,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.118
social media influencing,
and Reiki.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.519
Classic Evan.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.958
- What'd you find?
- That.

25:14.040 --> 25:18.239
I got her credentials, but without
her security fob, we don't have shit.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.296
You check the closet.
I'll take the nightstand...

25:21.320 --> 25:23.596
She'll have it on her.
It's bank protocol.

25:23.680 --> 25:26.400
How do you know she doesn't get
sloppy sometimes and leave it behind?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.949
You read the same
shit on her I did.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.351
She's a single mom who spent three years
in night school to get this job.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.874
Someone like that
isn't gonna risk

25:34.960 --> 25:37.555
the best gig they've ever had
by being sloppy.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.752
So, we install a listener
on her machine, wait for her to log in.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.878
It's the holidays. She isn't
logging in any time soon,

25:43.960 --> 25:48.034
and even if she did, we'd only have
60 seconds to swipe the code.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.919
Okay, we phish her,
get her to log in,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.515
catch the RSA code,
then we're all good.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.159
If she doesn't
take the bait?

25:56.040 --> 25:57.838
We don't have time
to chance it.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.194
Well, if you have any ideas,
I'm all fucking ears.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.874
Looks like
he stood her up.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.034
Okay.
She's leaving.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.435
Let's go back
and regroup.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.399
I found a bottle of oxy
in her apartment.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.436
So?

26:49.400 --> 26:52.518
She's an addict
who's supposedly gone straight.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.356
Her custody agreement says
if she gets caught using again,

26:57.440 --> 26:59.033
she loses her kid.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.792
So, what do you want to do
with that information, exactly?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.798
You know
how this works.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.280
- Hang on, kiddo.
- What for?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.511
Why don't you try
a little small talk?

27:12.600 --> 27:15.399
Keep her here for a while, grab the fob,
and then punch in the code.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.358
There's no time
for small talk.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.713
Not when
we already own her.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.469
I'm sorry.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.636
Excuse me?

27:38.920 --> 27:40.639
You're gonna wanna
sit back down.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.834
What are you
talking about?

27:44.400 --> 27:46.119
'Cause I'm gonna
buy you a drink.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.390
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

27:50.520 --> 27:52.671
This is a waste of time
we don't have.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.195
I'm Elliot.
Now you know me.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.476
I'm gonna take off, actually.
It's been a long day.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.199
Okay,
I'll come clean.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.117
I couldn't help but notice
you were stood up.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.600
Now, it's none of my business,
but the guy's clearly a sack of shit

28:08.680 --> 28:11.195
to leave you alone on Christmas Eve
and if you'd let me,

28:11.280 --> 28:14.159
I'd like to apologize for those
of us who've done you wrong

28:14.240 --> 28:15.754
by buying you a drink.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.914
Another round?

28:29.200 --> 28:32.352
Why not?
It's Christmas.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.720
You're up.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.589
Here you go, Juanito. Tell your mama
I packed it special for her.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.680
Merry X-mas.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.395
Tell me you brought tidings of joy
about my dude, Elliot.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.196
Come on, bruh. What was so important
about this motherfucker anyway?

29:44.440 --> 29:46.079
You know why
we came back here, right?

29:49.720 --> 29:50.790
Well, do you?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.633
So, you could be
king of New York.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.176
And in order for our kingdom
to be built, I need a brilliant...

29:55.200 --> 29:56.236
Architect.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.320
I know.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.160
Yeah, see? You totally get it.
You just be sellin' yourself short.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.595
Hey, listen here, bruh.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.236
Look, I may not
be no architect,

30:07.320 --> 30:10.438
but let me tell you something,
I'm loyal to the bone.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.591
So, lemme just get my gun,
put it to his head,

30:12.680 --> 30:14.216
and make him give you
what the fuck you want.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.311
How many times
I gotta explain it?

30:18.240 --> 30:20.232
I don't want Elliot
to be my prisoner.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.073
A visionary like him
don't work like that.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.595
I want him to be my partner.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.518
Now, reflect

30:29.880 --> 30:31.473
and gimme something
I can use.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.717
Come on, bruh.
This kid is aloof.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.830
I may be able to catch him
around his hood sometimes,

30:36.920 --> 30:40.197
but, for the most part,
he riding solo and giving up nothin'.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.320
What do you mean
"for the most part"?

30:45.480 --> 30:47.836
Well, see?
You gotta be more detailed.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.274
The devil is in that shit.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.594
Well, I did see him arguing
with this lady though, right?

30:53.680 --> 30:54.909
And she seemed
pretty mad.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.793
- Mad how?
- I dunno. Mad.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.514
Details, bruh.
Be specific.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.034
Was she crying?

31:02.120 --> 31:03.918
Was her nipples hard?

31:04.400 --> 31:06.392
Did a vein pop outta
her forehead?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.280
Man, make the connection.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.793
Tell me you at least
took some fucking pics.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.556
Yeah, man, of course.
I got you. Look.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.429
Right there.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.829
You see?
She's pissed, so what?

31:26.480 --> 31:28.437
Look, bruh, we wastin' our time
with this.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.479
If we took the risk
to get back here,

31:31.560 --> 31:34.598
I mean, shit, we might as well
put it to good use, baby.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.716
Hey, kid.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.960
Tell me what you see.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.271
He feels bad
because she's yelling.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.319
Like when my mom is mean to me.
It makes me sad.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.155
Like him.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.596
How come this fucking little kid
sees it, and you don't?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.480
This ain't about her.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.550
Her anger legit,
no doubt,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.552
but the shit you need to see
is on him.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.479
She hurt him.
Not no superficial pain neither,

32:29.560 --> 32:32.997
we're talking the stab
in your heart kind.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.953
She our girl.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.038
She knows something
I gotta know.

32:45.320 --> 32:49.519
Sorry, bruh. Guess I just need someone
a little more detail-oriented.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
No, please...

33:03.880 --> 33:09.035
So, we already know
why I'm here on Christmas Eve.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.959
What's your sob story?

33:15.160 --> 33:19.120
I don't know. I guess I don't have
anywhere else to be.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.790
No family?

33:23.960 --> 33:26.555
My sister and I
got into a big fight.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.393
My mom died
yesterday.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.709
Oh, my God.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.594
I'm so sorry.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.469
For what?

33:40.960 --> 33:42.189
For your...

33:43.600 --> 33:45.956
You know, the thing
about your mom dying?

33:48.640 --> 33:50.199
Oh.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.511
No, we weren't
that close.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.550
Yeah, I kinda have
the same deal with my dad.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.870
I mean, we used to
be pretty tight,

34:05.960 --> 34:07.997
but not as close as
my mom and me.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.594
She was amazing.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.835
She died, too,
back in Colombia.

34:19.719 --> 34:20.995
I took it really hard.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.192
I kinda put my dad through
a lot of shit after that and...

34:27.080 --> 34:28.958
Well, we don't
have to get into it.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.989
Okay.

34:46.560 --> 34:50.634
I'm addicted
to morphine.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.717
Well, do you have
some on you?

34:59.040 --> 35:01.839
I'm kidding.
Oh, my God, your face.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.674
Now I feel bad.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.155
No, no, that's, that's okay.
I deserved that.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.079
So, how long
you been clean?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.958
Almost nine months now.

35:18.280 --> 35:22.877
Well, no, not if you count
the heroin I did two days ago.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.792
But I didn't really want it.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.509
Did someone hold you down
and force you to do it?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.236
Yeah.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.393
But I'm clean now.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.832
Are you crazy
or something?

35:44.720 --> 35:46.279
I guess so.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.152
I'm not like most people.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.915
Yeah, I'm starting
to pick up on that.

36:03.960 --> 36:04.960
Olivia?

36:06.240 --> 36:08.436
Evan. From OkCupid?

36:10.840 --> 36:12.752
I'm sorry, I have no idea
who you are.

36:14.720 --> 36:15.949
Isn't this you?

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
Nope.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.233
This is totally you.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.391
Look, it's getting late.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.199
Well, nice to
meet you, Elliot.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.312
Well, you did better
than I thought you would.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.677
Uh... Just looking
for some aspirin.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.356
Shit.
Here, let me help.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.119
All this crap.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.474
It's not
what you think.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.592
Look, earlier,
when I told you

39:39.680 --> 39:41.911
that I put my dad through
some shit when my mom died?

39:45.120 --> 39:46.634
It was because of this.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.714
I was really fucked up
after my mom got killed.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.073
Murdered, actually.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.672
I never say that
to anyone.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.593
It totally wrecked me

40:24.680 --> 40:26.751
and I couldn't
pull myself out of it.

40:28.200 --> 40:31.159
And then one day,
someone gave me a pill and...

40:35.160 --> 40:36.958
That was that.
It was

40:37.720 --> 40:40.713
like my way out of
that black hole.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.069
But it led me
right into another one.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.194
One that hurt
a lot less...

40:58.280 --> 41:00.112
...for a while, anyway.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.554
A reminder.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.757
If I hate myself enough
to start using again,

41:22.840 --> 41:24.513
I might as well
kill myself.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.800
There it is.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.560
The moment I tell you
I'm crazy, too.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.440
I get it.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.913
I know what it's like.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.555
What?

42:02.600 --> 42:04.034
Hating yourself.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.759
I almost did it once.

42:29.720 --> 42:31.120
What stopped you?

42:34.880 --> 42:38.032
I promised a kid I'd take him
to go see <i>The Martian.</i>

42:44.560 --> 42:46.074
Yeah, of course.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.038
You know,
you can't scare me.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.760
Well, there's a lot more crazy
where that came from.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.670
But I think that's
enough for tonight.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.576
<i>Who knew
Olivia would be the one</i>

43:24.600 --> 43:27.160
<i>to override Elliot's
attempts to deny access?</i>

43:30.080 --> 43:31.639
<i>Now he's gotten
the message.</i>

43:34.760 --> 43:36.672
<i>Letting people in
doesn't have to hurt.</i>

43:51.000 --> 43:52.912
Why are you stopping?
We gotta get to Allsafe.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.312
That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.114
Dark Army?

44:00.880 --> 44:01.880
It's gotta be.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.999
You think Olivia
ratted us out?

44:05.920 --> 44:07.673
No. We got
outta there clean.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.193
This is a trap.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.616
We've been off their radar
for months,

44:11.640 --> 44:14.235
all of a sudden Whiterose takes
interest in us again?

44:14.320 --> 44:16.630
What if she's trying
to find out about our plan?

44:19.320 --> 44:21.277
Then let's show her
we don't have one.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.272
We'll just go home
and act normal.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.439
<i>Here's our turn again.</i>

44:45.000 --> 44:47.231
<i>Loading a bullet
into a chamber,</i>

44:48.400 --> 44:50.039
<i>spinning the cylinder,</i>

44:51.000 --> 44:52.593
<i>and then...</i>

44:57.280 --> 44:58.714
<i>...the trigger.</i>

44:59.720 --> 45:02.713
<i>Question is, are we getting
that friendly click</i>

45:03.520 --> 45:05.477
<i>or is it the end
of the game?</i>

45:06.880 --> 45:09.714
That's it.
We cannot go in there.

45:10.760 --> 45:13.355
- Let's make a run for it.
- Run where?

45:13.480 --> 45:15.119
They're outside, too.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.669
What do we do?

45:22.960 --> 45:25.680
Exactly what we'd do
if we had nothing to hide.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.272
<i>Like I said before,</i>

45:33.360 --> 45:35.431
<i>letting people in
doesn't have to hurt,</i>

45:36.440 --> 45:37.760
<i>but it can.</i>

45:38.680 --> 45:41.832
<i>Especially if they're the type
of person that doesn't ask,</i>

45:41.920 --> 45:43.559
<i>that just
forces their way in</i>

45:44.480 --> 45:46.233
<i>whether you want them to
or not.</i>

45:49.720 --> 45:50.720
Elliot.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.656
I've come with the news
we've been waiting for.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.990
They wanna make me
CEO of E Corp.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.759
Are you hearing me? The offer
came directly from Whiterose.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.157
What's this...
What are you doing?

46:03.520 --> 46:05.876
This is exactly
what we've been waiting for.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.476
We're on the inside,
it's time to take them down.
