WEBVTT

00:04.296 --> 00:06.256
<i>Man, sometimes I'm just going about my day</i>

00:06.757 --> 00:12.054
<i>and there's a sound or a smell,
and I'm back there.</i>

00:12.763 --> 00:15.974
And I don't mean like a memory.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.810
I mean I'm really fucking back there...

00:20.479 --> 00:21.688
hurting those people.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.442
So these types of flashbacks
you're describing, super common.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.611
That's our brain's way
of processing trauma.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.863
Yeah, my brain is an asshole.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.741
Your brain's a whole boardroom full
of assholes.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.327
You got the judge. You got the critic.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.372
You got that guy in the back of the room
who's saying "Eat more hot wings,"

00:38.372 --> 00:40.916
even though you just had a huge dinner.
I hate that fucking guy.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.794
To ever move forward,
you're gonna have to...

00:47.965 --> 00:50.217
I'm sorry. All I can think
about right now are hot wings.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.018
Morning. What are you guys up to?

01:00.018 --> 01:02.354
Doing the work, like you said.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.147
How's that going?

01:04.147 --> 01:05.399
It sucked donkey dick.

01:06.108 --> 01:09.278
I just told my daughter
about the Parkinson's.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.404
How did it go?

01:11.154 --> 01:17.661
Well, she's flying down here next week
to make sure I get the best possible care.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.415
So it's kinda donkey dickish.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.126
At least you're facing the pain.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.045
It's important.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.131
'Cause if you don't face the pain,

01:29.131 --> 01:34.344
eventually it'll come back and get you
when you least expect it.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.765
- Are you talking to me or Sean?
- I'm talking to Sean.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.727
- 'Cause you're looking directly at me.
- I can look anywhere I want.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.481
You're doing a great job, kid.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.609
Thanks.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.236
Still Sean.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.116
So needy. Jesus.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.578
- But that one was for me, Paul.
- Yep.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.243
Schwing.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.042
Sorry. It's just, Rick, I like you,

02:47.042 --> 02:49.586
but the eye contact is, like, so dramatic.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.714
I feel like I'm in a--
like a perfume commercial or something.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.134
It's all good. We can loosen it up.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.762
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah. All right.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.808
You okay?

03:02.808 --> 03:06.603
I snorted, which I don't think
I've ever done before.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.272
Sorry.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.941
Maybe you should just kiss my neck.
I love that.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.068
- Just kiss it.
- Okay. Let's go to the neck.

03:13.068 --> 03:13.986
Let's go to it.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.739
- Do you like it? Yeah?
- No.

03:19.283 --> 03:23.912
I'm sorry, it's not you. I was thinking
about how, like, grody lip bacteria is.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.206
It's actually kinda gross,
when you really think about it,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
'cause it's, like, a whole ecosystem.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.919
Well, thank you so much.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.713
Oh, wow. Okay.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.382
You shook hands?

03:35.382 --> 03:39.720
Yes, I know. That's usually something
that I reserve for after sex.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.054
What a nice gesture.

03:41.638 --> 03:45.225
May I say that I'm flattered
that you chose to call me about this?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.936
<i>Yeah, all my other girls know Nico.</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:50.022
I can't have him hearing I'm trying to

03:50.022 --> 03:52.274
take all these dudes
to pound town right now, you know?

03:52.274 --> 03:54.902
All I heard was
that I'm one of your girls.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.153
<i>This guy was so hot.</i>

03:56.153 --> 03:57.237
I just couldn't--

03:58.447 --> 04:00.699
God, why is there no female version
of "get it up"?

04:00.699 --> 04:03.076
Because "juiced" was stolen by steroids.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.705
- What the fuck is wrong with me?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

04:06.705 --> 04:10.083
You tried to have morning sex.
Who has sex in the morning?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.586
<i>You're not trying to trick him
into marrying you.</i>

04:13.504 --> 04:14.338
Okay.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.464
Liz is picking me up again.

04:17.089 --> 04:17.925
Liz.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.053
She raw dogged me at the cheese store.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.514
What do you think raw dogging means?

04:24.473 --> 04:27.184
To talk to somebody
that doesn't want to talk to you.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.102
No.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.647
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Liz.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.106
I have something for you.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.317
For me?

04:35.317 --> 04:36.235
Gummy bears?

04:36.235 --> 04:39.780
My Pilates instructor's cousin's aunt
has Parkinson's,

04:39.780 --> 04:43.408
and she says these really helped
with anxiety and tremors.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.369
Well, as long as it's scientific.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.454
"Stankadelic."

04:47.454 --> 04:51.041
Look, best-case scenario, it helps.

04:51.041 --> 04:55.128
Worst-case scenario, you get a little high
and you buy another one of those hats.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.506
Just don't take it after drinking

04:57.506 --> 04:58.549
or you'll vom.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.093
- Hey, Liz.
- Yeah.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.803
One more thing.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.223
Don't raw dog me again, all right?

05:07.766 --> 05:08.809
But--

05:08.809 --> 05:11.770
- What does he think that means?
- I don't know

05:11.770 --> 05:13.981
but he says it so confidently.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.238
Wow. You finally bought it.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.990
Tell us.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.034
- We will react correctly this time.
- That's right.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.578
I'm gonna ask Charlie to marry me!

05:27.578 --> 05:28.787
Yeah!

05:30.622 --> 05:32.291
I believe you!

05:32.958 --> 05:36.587
- Wow. You little monogamous slut! Wow!
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.963
So, how you gonna do it, man?

05:37.963 --> 05:40.048
Okay, I'm gonna invite
all of our friends someplace,

05:40.048 --> 05:42.134
and then I'm gonna pop the question
in front of them.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.218
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.429
If he says yes, surprise engagement party.

05:45.429 --> 05:48.223
- What are you gonna do if he says no?
- Then I have all my friends there

05:48.223 --> 05:49.308
to console me.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.727
Either way, I'm the center of attention.

05:52.895 --> 05:57.316
Unfortunately our place
isn't big enough for a party.

05:58.942 --> 06:02.446
If only I knew somebody
with a house, you know?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.616
Why didn't you just say
we'd have the party here?

06:05.616 --> 06:09.745
I don't know. This place hasn't
had much of a party vibe lately.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.749
And honestly, I'm not sure I'm ready
to open our house up to the world yet.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.042
But we're doing so much better.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.210
We? Like--

06:17.503 --> 06:19.796
Like, "we" like each of us as individuals

06:19.796 --> 06:22.007
or "we" like a daddy-daughter unit?

06:22.007 --> 06:24.301
I see your face.
I shouldn't have said "daddy."

06:24.301 --> 06:26.303
Father. Father-daughter unit.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.348
I get it. You don't like it
when I say "unit".

06:29.348 --> 06:30.724
- Nope.
- Got it.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.394
Come on. You and Mom used to throw parties
all the time. Mom loved parties.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.563
Pulling the mom card, huh?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.277
- Okay, fine. Yes, let's do it.
- Really?

06:42.277 --> 06:43.820
Oh, wow.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.538
Wait, so how do surprise
engagement parties work anyways?

06:52.538 --> 06:53.664
Here's how it's gonna work.

06:53.664 --> 06:57.167
Charlie thinks the party is because
you won Therapist of the Year.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.212
Wow, that's insane.
How would they even judge that, Bri?

07:00.212 --> 07:02.047
- Yeah, that's why it's insane.
- Uh-huh.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.050
He thinks I'm coming over early
to help you set up. Much better.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.053
So, when he arrives, that's your cue
to sit down at the piano.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.389
And then you'll start to play.

07:10.389 --> 07:13.016
- Great.
- And I will sing our song,

07:14.059 --> 07:16.854
- "You Are So Beautiful."
- Thanks, but what's the song?

07:16.854 --> 07:18.355
"You Are So Beautiful."

07:19.481 --> 07:21.275
You were doing a bit, but I missed it.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.610
I'm off. Should we postpone?

07:23.610 --> 07:24.820
Don't. Hey, you're panicking.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.655
Breathe, breathe, breathe, Bri. Come on.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.367
Everything goes your way, right?

07:31.702 --> 07:34.580
See? This is why
you're Therapist of the Year.

07:46.758 --> 07:47.801
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.053
Do you think anyone would care
if I skipped this party?

07:50.053 --> 07:51.263
What's your deal?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.724
My deal is old people asking me
what I do for a living.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.475
- So?
- Oh, yes.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.686
I'm currently unemployed,

07:57.686 --> 07:59.897
and I'm living
in my therapist's pool house

07:59.897 --> 08:02.858
because my violent outbursts
put me in jail.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.153
But how are you, Alice?
How was your summer?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.615
My mom suddenly died,
so I spent it scream-crying.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.367
- Sounds very fun. We went to Maine.
- Yeah.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.329
You should still come.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.498
I mean, If somebody asks you
a tough question,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.918
I'll just change the subject.
I've got your back.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.879
Okay.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.341
- Go get dressed.
- I am dressed.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.261
I'll go get dressed.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.062
Who the fuck shows up early to a party?

08:40.687 --> 08:43.023
Hey. You're the first to arrive.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.566
Wanted to beat the traffic.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.194
I had to rush putting up my hair

08:47.194 --> 08:48.904
so I could hear that joke again.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.658
Come on. I haven't made that joke before.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.784
Have I, Jimmy?

08:57.788 --> 08:59.164
Wanted to beat the traffic.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.834
Well, someone's
gotta get the party started.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.752
Yeah. Come on in.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.134
You see? Even Jimmy hates the joke.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.596
- You gave him sad face.
- Ugh, it's just face. Come on in.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.681
Ugh.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.432
Hey, Dad.

09:20.686 --> 09:25.065
Wow. You look... so beautiful.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.149
Thanks.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.070
Okay, do you think you can stop
before you overdo it?

09:32.114 --> 09:34.616
- You look like a princess.
- Why?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.702
- Let's go get a drink.
- So pretty.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.662
- Hey, Liz.
- Hi!

09:38.662 --> 09:40.205
Hey, Liz's husband.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.501
- You look amazing.
- She doesn't like that.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.878
You look like a princess.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.921
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- What the fuck?

09:48.505 --> 09:51.842
Almost everyone I invited said yes.
Only two noes. Bernadette Peters--

09:51.842 --> 09:53.218
- He's never met her.
- Right.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.303
It still stung.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.430
And the other no is Paul.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.266
He says he has something important
to do tonight.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.565
How you doin'?

10:48.565 --> 10:51.527
So, what have you been up to lately, Sean?

10:55.572 --> 10:56.949
Hey, what was it like in the '70s?

10:56.949 --> 10:58.325
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.619
Okay, well, put your seat belts on

11:00.619 --> 11:04.248
because this guy had a perm.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.500
I was pretty groovy.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.628
Also, we didn't use seat belts.
It's the truth.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.046
Nobody cared.

11:11.046 --> 11:15.050
The number one candy in the country
was a pack of candy cigarettes.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.426
Kids loved 'em.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.595
It was amazing. I had a motorcycle.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.013
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

11:20.639 --> 11:21.473
Jimmy.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.308
- Hey! Oh, my gosh. Hey.
- Hey.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.269
- It's been forever.
- Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.020
Yeah. We haven't seen you
since the funeral.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.357
Eric. I'm sorry. He's an idiot.
How are you?

11:31.567 --> 11:32.609
I'm doing pretty good.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.069
- Glad to hear it.
- Really?

11:34.611 --> 11:37.990
- You and Tia were such an amazing couple.
- Indeed.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.910
- It's so great to see you.
- Oh, my God. You too.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.038
- Is Nico here too?
- We actually got divorced.

11:45.038 --> 11:49.585
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.587
- No, no, no.
- No, no. It's good.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.338
Hey, that's a lot of noes.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.091
- That's a lot of noes. We're good.
- No.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.801
She loved you so much.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.348
You were so great together.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.896
You two were such an inspiration.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.443
Look at that. I'm fresh out.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.236
Another tequila, please.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.782
Make it two. I don't think
I was ready for a party.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.576
People are fucking idiots.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.870
God, you are preaching to the "choi-choi."

12:28.248 --> 12:32.336
I went out with three dudes last week,
all hot as shit, okay?

12:32.336 --> 12:34.463
And I couldn't lady-get-it-up
for any of 'em.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.673
I've been trying to think
of a term for that.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.342
Last night we had Mexican food

12:38.342 --> 12:40.719
and I came up with "guac the taco."

12:40.719 --> 12:42.763
Oh, no. I don't like that.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.350
Look, maybe I'm just
not a sexual person anymore.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.770
You know you're being batshit, right?
Libidos change.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.979
Here you go, hon.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.524
Derek, remember when I used to
want to fuck all the time?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.151
Yes. The salad days.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.905
Now, my sex window
is between 3:00 and 3:20 p.m.,

12:59.905 --> 13:02.366
and Derek needs not
to have annoyed me that day.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.701
- Okay.
- It does not happen often.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.079
I think it's Charlie.

13:07.079 --> 13:10.290
- Should we hide?
- Not that kind of surprise, Liz's husband!

13:14.044 --> 13:16.213
I thought you were busy tonight.
Why are you here?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.882
- I don't know.
- Okay. Come in.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.009
Come on.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.636
Look who's here, everyone.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.847
- She tried to kill me.
- What?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.723
She tried to kill me.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.892
Liz, can you...

13:28.892 --> 13:30.519
- I didn't-- Hi, hi, hi.
- Nah. Uh-uh.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.854
- I didn't try to kill him.
- Okay.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.105
All right. Come on. Come on.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.231
- Come with me.
- I'm leaving.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.233
- No. Don't go. Come on in.
- No, you can stay.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.401
- No, I'm--
- Come on.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.236
- Come stay. Let's get some food.
- Get a plate.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.905
- Yeah. We're gonna get a plate.
- Jesus Christ.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.491
3:00 to 3:20
is a really tight window, Derek.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.159
Yeah, tell me about it.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.001
Jimmy.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.878
Ben! Hey, Ben, Ben, Ben.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.465
- Good hug. Good hug.
- Shh. Don't say anything.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.885
Hey, have you met
my new girlfriend, Kiara?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.053
Nope.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.848
Hey. Wow. Hi. Hello. Good to meet you.

14:08.432 --> 14:12.269
How did you guys
make this meaningful soul connection?

14:12.269 --> 14:13.437
Funny story.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.230
We met in church.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.108
That is a funny story.
You're right. You called it.

14:18.108 --> 14:22.196
Well, it's good to see you, Kiara,
for the first time ever.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.447
Nice meeting you.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.118
<i>We're actually jealous of your marriage.</i>

14:28.118 --> 14:31.163
Truth be told, Kim and I are
kind of relieved this year is over with.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.582
It's been a rough stretch for us.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.460
Bet that doesn't happen when you have
a therapist in the family.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.711
You'd be surprised.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.762
I can't believe I used to do this for fun.

14:46.762 --> 14:50.307
Yeah, pot has gotten
much stronger since the '70s.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.059
Who's this fucking guy?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.727
Let's do this.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.980
- That's much better.
- Yeah.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.649
I am so parched.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.150
What can we get you to drink?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.861
- A Popsicle?
- Go get Paul a Popsicle.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.156
- What if they don't have any Popsicles?
- Then go get one from the house.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.241
One of my good ones?

15:08.116 --> 15:09.117
Fine.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.788
That waiter's a dick.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.873
Hey. How's Cheech doing?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.166
Not good.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.126
This is on you too, you know.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.087
What did I do?

15:20.087 --> 15:23.507
You told me
I had to tell Meg that I had Parkinson's.

15:24.258 --> 15:28.512
And now she's flying down here tomorrow
to take charge of my care.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.392
You know, I've been wanting
to spend more time with her,

15:34.142 --> 15:35.143
but she's so busy.

15:35.143 --> 15:39.690
And then I tell her that I'm sick,
and she drops everything

15:39.690 --> 15:41.775
because she feels she has to.

15:42.401 --> 15:43.944
It's emotional blackmail.

15:43.944 --> 15:49.241
Like you springing this proposal
on Charlie in front of all these people.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.078
- No, my thing is not emotional blackmail.
- Uh-huh.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.122
Is it?

15:55.122 --> 15:57.082
It's not not that.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.502
- See?
- Oh, my God.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.254
- What are you laugh--
- Sorry.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.714
I'm sorry. I took a gummy too.

16:03.714 --> 16:04.673
Oh, my God.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.927
No. Remember? We talked.

16:08.927 --> 16:13.348
Ties are for wearing, remember?
We talked a lot about the tie.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.684
I like tequila with Sprite.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.478
- Gas station margarita, huh?
- Yeah.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
- Gaby! Hey.
- Hey.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.815
- Can I freshen your drink?
- No,

16:21.815 --> 16:23.442
I think I need to slow down, actually.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.194
This is my friend, Kiara.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.445
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:26.445 --> 16:27.988
She helped me through a tough time.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.448
I used to be a sex worker.

16:30.449 --> 16:33.076
We mostly played Uno, though,
'cause I couldn't get an erection.

16:33.076 --> 16:33.994
Oh, my God.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.580
- We also watched <i>Top Chef.</i>
- That's true.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.916
But I'm retired.
Now I let Ben pay for everything.

16:38.916 --> 16:42.753
Ben? You're trying to tell me
you can lady-get-it-up for that guy?

16:42.753 --> 16:44.546
You mean grease the peach?

16:44.546 --> 16:46.173
Now, that I like. That--

16:46.673 --> 16:49.635
Liz. Grease the peach.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.094
Love it.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.188
- Ain't they cute?
- Too far.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.107
I told you, though, old people love
talking about themselves, it's like--

17:04.608 --> 17:05.442
Hello?

17:06.527 --> 17:07.528
Pull over.

17:07.528 --> 17:10.321
- Uh-oh, pull over.
- What the fuck?

17:12.741 --> 17:14.535
Seems like you're drinking.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.994
- Yeah, it's not that big of a deal, Dad.
- It isn't?

17:16.994 --> 17:21.708
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Do you need water? Like--

17:24.586 --> 17:25.796
What's up?

17:25.796 --> 17:30.551
I understand that you are trying
to look cool

17:30.551 --> 17:32.302
- in front of Sean.
- I'm not trying to look cool.

17:32.970 --> 17:36.223
I'm not trying to look cool
in front of Sean.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.684
Sweetie, angel,

17:40.561 --> 17:43.230
I know that you think
that he is beautiful...

17:45.232 --> 17:46.650
I heard it.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.027
I heard it when you whispered.

17:53.699 --> 17:54.700
Okay.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.201
- Hey.
- Yes?

17:56.201 --> 17:57.870
What did you just say to her, man?

17:58.579 --> 18:00.873
I said,
"How fast can you run up the stairs?"

18:03.125 --> 18:04.126
That's cute.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.758
- Hi.
- What the hell was that?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.051
I don't know.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.096
What's the problem?

18:17.598 --> 18:21.476
I've had a lot of fucking people
come up to me at this stupid party

18:21.476 --> 18:26.648
and tell me that... Tia and I were
some sort of perfect couple.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.235
Gaby, we were not.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.864
<i>At the end,
we were fighting about everything.</i>

18:33.864 --> 18:37.951
When I left to visit my mom,
you forgot to pick up Alice from school.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.788
I did not forget! I was late.
Stop saying I forgot. I was late.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.541
My God, Jimmy, you don't even know
what's going on around this house.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.710
You are so obsessed with your work.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.796
You know, it would be great if, for once,
I was the person who got to leave.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.133
Are we back here again?
Then go to work, Tia. Jesus Christ.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.468
Keep your voice down.

18:54.468 --> 18:57.221
<i>I think I'm feeling
like a fucking fraud, Gab.</i>

18:57.221 --> 18:58.305
<i>You're not a fraud.</i>

18:58.305 --> 19:02.100
Now, you and I both know that
no relationship is perfect, all right?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.644
That's how we make our living.

19:04.144 --> 19:09.191
It was shitty for months before Tia died.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.406
I'm sorry that you're so unhappy,
I truly am,

19:16.907 --> 19:21.995
but I'm really sick of being your excuse
for why you're not happy with your life.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.207
Yeah, I'm sick of it too.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.629
<i>The last party we had here,
she had a look on her face.</i>

19:31.255 --> 19:32.965
<i>I fucking saw it.</i>

19:32.965 --> 19:35.467
I don't think that
she loved me anymore, Gaby.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.137
I'm not even sure that she liked me.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.557
She was thinking of leaving me, Gab.

19:41.557 --> 19:44.935
This is all based on some fucking look?
Are you serious, man? Really, all of this?

19:44.935 --> 19:47.855
Yes, it's about a look. It's the
worst fucking look I ever saw in my life.

19:47.855 --> 19:51.233
Okay, listen, I know you guys had
a rough patch. I know about that.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.194
But she was not thinking about
leaving you. She would've told me.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.238
- She would not have told you.
- Yes, she would have.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.448
She knows you and I were close.
She would not have told you.

19:58.448 --> 20:03.704
You have to listen to me, seriously.
Tia fucking loved you. I mean it.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.039
Prove it.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.208
Prove it?
How the fuck am I supposed to prove it?

20:08.792 --> 20:09.793
Exactly.

20:14.298 --> 20:18.218
You are acting like it's a bad thing to
expect your kids to come through for you.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.847
Fuck that.
I'm gonna text my eldest, Matthew.

20:23.432 --> 20:27.311
"I'm sad and blue, and if you
don't call me, I'll be so, so mad."

20:27.311 --> 20:28.478
Send.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.110
Decline.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.154
Baller move.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.656
Look, I wiped their butts,
I looked over their homework,

20:39.656 --> 20:43.619
I went to all their long-ass,
boring baseball games.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.703
I love baseball.

20:44.703 --> 20:45.787
Baseball's awful.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.583
I was there for them,
so they better be there for me.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.792
I've earned it.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.544
Well, I didn't earn it.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.506
She was so little
when her mom and I split.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.550
I should've been there for her,
but I wasn't.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.178
Okay, it sounds like you fucked up.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.223
She's showing up for you anyway.

21:05.140 --> 21:09.520
If I were you, I wouldn't be feeling
sorry for myself. I'd be feeling grateful.

21:11.980 --> 21:12.814
Yeah.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.733
Good. Done.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.779
I need something crunchy
and cheese-flavored.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.113
Derek?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.573
- Who's Derek?
- The waiter.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.033
Derek?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.876
Hey, wanna talk about it?

21:33.877 --> 21:35.879
- Nope.
- Cool. Neither do I.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.723
Okay.
This song will definitely cheer you up.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.733
Charlie, you're finally here!

21:56.733 --> 21:58.527
I stopped to buy Jimmy a card.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.864
So nice.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.450
Ow. What is happening?

22:05.450 --> 22:07.160
All will be revealed.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.413
Where the fuck is Jimmy?

22:11.456 --> 22:13.125
Hey-oh. Here we go. Ready?

22:13.959 --> 22:16.170
Jimmy, now. It's showtime.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.671
I'm here.

22:22.593 --> 22:23.969
Okay. All right.

22:25.554 --> 22:26.597
Charlie,

22:27.556 --> 22:29.391
tonight is a celebration,

22:30.142 --> 22:31.935
but it's not what you think.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.021
Okay. Ready?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.107
Here we go.

22:45.115 --> 22:50.537
<i>You are so beautiful</i>

22:55.375 --> 22:57.294
Come on. A little faster.
Here we go, buddy.

22:58.587 --> 23:01.965
- <i>To me</i>
- <i>To me</i>

23:03.217 --> 23:08.263
- <i>You are so beautiful</i>
- <i>You are so beautiful</i>

23:08.263 --> 23:10.516
Not a duet.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.269
- <i>To me</i>
- <i>To me</i>

23:14.269 --> 23:16.271
- <i>Can't you see?</i>
- <i>Can't you see?</i>

23:19.733 --> 23:23.987
- <i>You're everything I hoped for</i>
- <i>You're everything I hoped for</i>

23:25.197 --> 23:31.370
<i>You're everything I need</i>

23:31.370 --> 23:32.579
Oh, my God.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.128
I threw up.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.005
We know, bud.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.508
Okay, we're gonna need a minute to re--

23:46.468 --> 23:48.512
- Oh, my God.
- Holy schnikes.

23:49.263 --> 23:53.183
Never mind. Everything's ruined.
Yeah, tha-- Party's over.

23:53.767 --> 23:54.685
Wasn't that nice?

23:54.685 --> 23:58.021
Okay. Everybody needs to look away.
Come on.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.231
- Gaby?
- What?

23:59.231 --> 24:01.650
- I threw up.
- I know. I saw it, and I can smell it.

24:01.650 --> 24:02.651
Let's go, wiener.

24:02.651 --> 24:05.529
- I'm too high for this shit.
- I'm not high enough.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.496
Poor Jimmy. And on his big night.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.875
Fuck Jimmy.
This was supposed to be our big night.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.878
That was supposed to be
a surprise proposal.

24:21.962 --> 24:26.049
This whole night was hell to plan.
Barely anybody helped me.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.385
Bernadette Peters sent
an obvious form email

24:28.385 --> 24:31.138
that she probably sends to all
the gay guys who invite her to parties,

24:31.138 --> 24:35.142
and then Jimmy turned into the girl
from the goddamn <i>Exorcist.</i>

24:35.642 --> 24:39.062
What a giant fucking disaster.

24:40.939 --> 24:41.940
Yes.

24:43.442 --> 24:47.112
Yes? Yes,
it's a giant fucking disaster, or...

24:49.323 --> 24:50.324
I will marry you.

24:52.034 --> 24:53.827
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:58.332 --> 25:00.459
Wait, I was supposed to
show you this first.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.214
It's beautiful.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.427
Put it on.

25:12.179 --> 25:13.347
Congratulations.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.391
You want some advice about
how to keep your marriage together

25:16.391 --> 25:18.685
and keep your daughter
from becoming estranged?

25:18.685 --> 25:19.978
- No, I don't--
- You know--

25:19.978 --> 25:22.022
Stay open, stay open.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.358
If your defenses come up, you're fucked.

25:25.317 --> 25:27.027
But two vulnerable people

25:27.027 --> 25:30.906
will always find a way to connect.

25:33.116 --> 25:37.079
Sean, I'm fine.
You don't have to stay. Go have fun.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.707
I am having fun. This is fun.
I'm with you.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.634
And where is this?

25:52.553 --> 25:55.889
- Alice.
- I'm sorry. It's cool, it's cool.

25:55.889 --> 25:58.058
- I just thought--
- Hey, you're just a kid.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.063
I should go.

26:03.564 --> 26:05.732
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- I'm gonna go.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.693
- It's okay.
- I really didn't--

26:14.575 --> 26:17.870
No, no, no, no, fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

26:24.543 --> 26:25.544
Fuck!

26:28.797 --> 26:29.798
Hello?

26:30.841 --> 26:31.758
Hi.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.635
You good?

26:34.428 --> 26:36.889
- I feel great.
- Good. Okay, good.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.182
- I gargled.
- Yeah.

26:38.182 --> 26:41.018
- I showered, and I took a bath.
- Yeah.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.312
- Good.
- I might've fallen asleep in there.

26:43.312 --> 26:46.023
I think you did.
You've been up here for an hour, so...

26:46.023 --> 26:48.275
- Oh, good. Maybe everyone forgot.
- No. Oh, my God.

26:48.275 --> 26:51.278
- It was just a murder scene down there.
- Fuck.

26:51.278 --> 26:55.407
Anyway, now that you seem to be coherent
and better,

26:55.908 --> 27:00.787
maybe you might wanna munch on this shit.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.750
That was my birthday.
It was two weeks before Tia died.

27:05.626 --> 27:08.253
Look at the love in her eyes.
She's, like, obsessed with you.

27:08.962 --> 27:12.424
You're so worried about a look?
How about that look?

27:13.842 --> 27:16.762
And you know what?
It's fucking baby-bitch bullshit

27:16.762 --> 27:18.597
that you think that
she wouldn't have told me.

27:18.597 --> 27:21.350
I knew it all, Jimmy,
and not just, like, the good stuff.

27:21.350 --> 27:26.021
She told me about how you didn't
pull your weight when Alice was born.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.649
- Yeah.
- She told me about that couple

27:28.649 --> 27:32.361
you guys almost hooked up with
at that alien-themed bar in Reno.

27:32.361 --> 27:34.363
- Oh, ye-- That was...
- What?

27:34.363 --> 27:35.447
...gonna be fun.

27:35.447 --> 27:38.450
I'm just saying if she was gonna
leave you, she would've told me.

27:38.450 --> 27:43.121
All right? So you gotta stop torturing
yourself with this shit, you know?

27:43.121 --> 27:46.917
I honestly think
that this is just another thing

27:46.917 --> 27:49.086
that's easier for you to focus on

27:50.003 --> 27:52.172
other than the sad fact that Tia is gone.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.301
But Jimmy, she loved you

27:57.344 --> 27:58.428
so much.

27:59.346 --> 28:00.597
This photo's the proof.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.769
- Thanks. Thanks so much.
- Of course.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.688
- Come here.
- It's all so fucking stupid.

28:07.688 --> 28:11.692
No, it's okay. Come here. It's good.

28:14.695 --> 28:16.738
Thanks. You're an amazing friend.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.699
No, I know. No shit.
