<i>Fall in the Midwest</i>

00:06.306 --> 00:08.765
<i>means one thing</i>
<i>and one thing only-- football.</i>

00:08.911 --> 00:11.346
<i>And with Axl playing college</i>
<i>ball for the first time,</i>

00:11.480 --> 00:12.855
<i>the pressure was on.</i>

00:13.482 --> 00:14.515
All right.

00:14.674 --> 00:16.302
We got to get this thing
in the end zone.

00:16.536 --> 00:18.292
You go right.
I'm gonna go left.

00:18.376 --> 00:20.619
- Got it!
- Ready?! Break!

00:20.744 --> 00:22.714
Let's go, freshmen!

00:22.794 --> 00:25.636
The thing is, Axl had gone from
<i>a big man on a small campus</i>

00:25.731 --> 00:28.341
<i>to a small man</i>
<i>on a bigger campus.</i>

00:28.421 --> 00:29.418
Here you go, freshman!

00:33.154 --> 00:34.694
So, Hutch, where are you from?

00:34.745 --> 00:36.187
Chicago.
How about yourself?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.908
Uh, a few towns thataway.

00:38.891 --> 00:40.290
I couldn't stay
forever, though.

00:40.434 --> 00:43.546
Had to break out,
test my stuff in the real world.

00:43.646 --> 00:44.977
- Ah, I feel you.
- Yeah.

00:45.075 --> 00:47.174
I already killed it back home,
so I had to move on.

00:47.317 --> 00:48.354
- Mm.
- I was so awesome,

00:48.468 --> 00:50.863
it was like I walked around
my high school in slow motion.

00:50.944 --> 00:51.668
Hmm.

00:51.763 --> 00:52.811
Prom king!

00:52.943 --> 00:54.137
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:54.247 --> 00:55.606
Oh, I can see that.

00:55.733 --> 00:57.033
- You're a good-looking guy.
- Mm.

00:57.127 --> 00:58.897
I'd hit that if I was into
hitting that kind of thing.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.058
Thanks, man.

01:00.156 --> 01:02.726
So, you liking college?

01:02.858 --> 01:04.430
Hells yeah.
What's not to like?

01:04.522 --> 01:06.077
Yeah. Same here, man.

01:06.581 --> 01:08.415
Time of my life.

01:12.819 --> 01:14.978
Hey. Don't eat that.
It's for the trick-or-treaters.

01:15.192 --> 01:16.360
Licorice menorahs?

01:16.458 --> 01:17.804
Yeah, well, when I buy
the good stuff,

01:17.887 --> 01:19.334
we eat it all before Halloween.

01:19.437 --> 01:21.354
So this way, none of us
will be tempted.

01:21.665 --> 01:22.811
Yeah.

01:22.911 --> 01:24.102
Gross, right?

01:25.775 --> 01:26.912
So, where's Brick?

01:27.004 --> 01:28.837
I got sick of him
not emptying the dishwasher,

01:28.930 --> 01:30.005
so I finally punished him.

01:30.092 --> 01:31.337
I made him go to a party.

01:31.553 --> 01:33.695
Wow. Pretty rough
for just the dishwasher.

01:33.772 --> 01:34.858
Well, he pushed me too far.

01:34.958 --> 01:35.963
I told him
if he doesn't shape up,

01:36.095 --> 01:37.729
he's getting a playdate.

01:37.941 --> 01:39.224
Well, that was horrible.

01:39.321 --> 01:40.745
Maybe next time,
you listen to your mom.

01:40.923 --> 01:42.717
No, it was
a new kind of horrible.

01:42.861 --> 01:44.355
I mean, at the few
elementary-school parties

01:44.444 --> 01:45.340
I was invited to,

01:45.497 --> 01:47.111
boys would run around
and be stupid,

01:47.283 --> 01:48.556
but now there's boys and girls,

01:48.681 --> 01:50.363
and everyone just hangs out
in the basement.

01:50.469 --> 01:51.794
Every time I turned up
the lights to read,

01:51.879 --> 01:53.773
someone would just
dim them down again.

01:53.965 --> 01:55.180
Next time I go to a party,

01:55.274 --> 01:57.003
I'm bringing
my itty-bitty book light.

01:57.377 --> 01:59.001
Ah--
well, you know, Brick,

01:59.085 --> 02:00.585
you're at that age
where boys and girls

02:00.706 --> 02:02.287
are starting
to notice each other.

02:02.410 --> 02:03.957
You just might not
be there yet.

02:04.070 --> 02:05.924
Oh, I'm there.
I'm definitely there.

02:06.133 --> 02:07.270
- You are?
- Big time.

02:07.405 --> 02:09.149
There's this one girl
I really like-- Harper.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.700
Really?
Oh, wow, Brick!

02:11.802 --> 02:13.370
So, what is it
that you like about her?

02:13.469 --> 02:14.586
Is she into books, like you?

02:14.737 --> 02:16.876
No, over the summer,
she got her boobs.

02:18.369 --> 02:19.582
Oh.

02:20.004 --> 02:23.045
So, uh, was she at the party?
Did you try to talk to her?

02:23.222 --> 02:24.461
Not exactly,

02:24.604 --> 02:26.192
but I kind of stared at her
for an hour

02:26.290 --> 02:29.165
until she got creeped out,
so I'm definitely on her radar.

02:29.682 --> 02:30.610
Brick, you can't just

02:30.766 --> 02:32.469
stare at someone
when you like 'em.

02:32.577 --> 02:34.999
You kind of have to,
you know...

02:36.651 --> 02:38.897
Jump in anytime, dad.

02:39.528 --> 02:41.541
Well, when I was your age
and I liked a girl,

02:41.655 --> 02:43.943
I would ride my bike
by her house.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.810
Yeah, I don't know
if people do that anymore.

02:45.984 --> 02:46.863
From what I've gleaned,

02:46.949 --> 02:48.911
they do more communicating
through social media--

02:48.993 --> 02:50.982
you know, texts, tweets,
and whatnot.

02:51.141 --> 02:53.253
They also don't use words
like "Gleaned."

02:53.366 --> 02:55.010
That's perfect for you,
Brick--

02:55.095 --> 02:56.960
no eye contact, all words.

02:57.118 --> 02:59.907
Yeah. I guess that might be
more apropos.

03:00.088 --> 03:01.774
But don't say "Apropos"!

03:02.838 --> 03:03.863
We really should
redo the basement

03:03.968 --> 03:06.080
- so he'll have someplace to live.
- Mm.

03:06.443 --> 03:08.812
Throw him down!
Get that pin!

03:08.918 --> 03:10.295
The fighting hens will...

03:10.394 --> 03:11.766
- ...cleanse your sin!
- ...peel your skin!

03:11.859 --> 03:13.173
...kick him in the mouth!

03:13.453 --> 03:14.488
You know what?

03:14.590 --> 03:17.747
Wrestlerettes isn't just about
well-thought-out cheers

03:17.854 --> 03:22.034
that people spent a lot of time
coming up with.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.869
It's about chemistry.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.856
There is only one way
to fix this.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.873
- Hemlock? - Quit because we suck?
- Prayer circle?

03:28.998 --> 03:32.941
No.
Team bonding sleepover.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.334
Mandatory!

03:37.765 --> 03:39.946
Axl, why did you take
all my stuff out?

03:40.060 --> 03:41.228
God, you are so selfish.

03:41.392 --> 03:44.220
You have all week to relax
and do all the laundry you want.

03:46.171 --> 03:48.023
How many uniforms do you own?

03:48.146 --> 03:50.410
They're hazing him, Frankie.
Making him do their laundry.

03:50.499 --> 03:52.081
Brings the team
closer together.

03:52.511 --> 03:54.375
Okay.
I don't get men at all.

03:54.524 --> 03:56.079
Yeah, I'm with you. This is really--

03:56.180 --> 03:57.134
Oh.

03:57.576 --> 03:58.364
Ohh.

03:59.060 --> 04:00.826
- What are you doing?
- Every time I get a text from a senior,

04:00.932 --> 04:02.197
I got to hop on one foot.

04:02.334 --> 04:05.326
- But they're not even here.
- Oh, they'll know.

04:08.857 --> 04:09.936
Hey, Brick.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.189
Hey, you never told me
what happened

04:11.280 --> 04:13.291
with that Harper girl, hmm?

04:13.390 --> 04:14.440
Did you ever e-mail her?

04:14.564 --> 04:16.151
- Uh-huh.
- You did?!

04:16.264 --> 04:17.380
Did she write you back?

04:17.466 --> 04:18.915
Yep.
About five days ago.

04:19.004 --> 04:20.110
Are you serious?

04:20.202 --> 04:21.434
So, what did she say?
What did you say?

04:21.574 --> 04:23.262
Nothing.
I haven't answered back.

04:23.624 --> 04:26.548
Brick, you can't leave her
hanging for five days.

04:26.646 --> 04:27.626
Mike, tell him.

04:28.008 --> 04:29.143
I gave him the bike idea.

04:29.234 --> 04:30.405
That's my best stuff.

04:30.488 --> 04:31.527
Hey, she's online.

04:31.599 --> 04:33.413
Good. This is good.
You got to message her.

04:33.511 --> 04:35.543
Tell her you're sorry.
You forgot to get back to her.

04:35.657 --> 04:36.615
Okay.

04:37.318 --> 04:41.229
"Sorry I didn't
get back to you.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.317
I forgot."

04:42.437 --> 04:43.530
Wait.
Don't say you forgot.

04:43.615 --> 04:45.976
It sounds like you don't care.
Make up a good excuse.

04:48.092 --> 04:49.758
"Sorry I didn't
get back to you.

04:50.047 --> 04:52.470
I had diarrhea."

04:52.727 --> 04:53.548
Send?

04:53.657 --> 04:54.671
Wait. Did you
just hit "Send"?!

04:54.858 --> 04:56.084
Mike,
he just hit "Send."

04:56.187 --> 04:57.242
Smooth, Brick.

04:57.322 --> 04:58.317
Might as well pull the plug.

04:58.396 --> 04:59.516
There's no coming back
from that.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.132
What? No, we're okay.

05:01.206 --> 05:02.970
Come on,
this is totally fixable.

05:03.028 --> 05:04.730
You just got to make sure
she knows it was a joke.

05:04.810 --> 05:06.880
Why are we hopping?
How much hopping did I miss?

05:06.995 --> 05:09.549
Brick's talking to a girl,
and mom's losing her mind.

05:09.755 --> 05:11.565
Oh.

05:11.642 --> 05:13.589
Got it. Hit her with a "jk"
and a smiley face.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.043
Go.
Typety, type, type!

05:17.214 --> 05:18.641
She said, "Ha."

05:18.741 --> 05:19.920
- Yes! - Good job, mom.
- Yay!

05:20.006 --> 05:21.904
All right.
Now you got her on the hook.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.178
Now you just got to
reel her in.

05:23.274 --> 05:24.732
Tell her you enjoyed
seeing her at school today.

05:24.811 --> 05:25.860
Ask if you can take her
to lunch.

05:25.935 --> 05:27.769
Oh, my God. Brick, don't listen
to anything these people say.

05:27.853 --> 05:29.094
I mean, look who they ended up with.

05:29.953 --> 05:31.511
She asked
what I'm doing right now.

05:31.588 --> 05:32.924
Oh, boy.
Okay, come on, guys.

05:32.993 --> 05:34.658
- What's he doing? What's he doing?
- I got this.

05:34.773 --> 05:36.938
You absolutely
do not got this. Wait.

05:37.080 --> 05:37.975
Quick, open a side window

05:38.097 --> 05:39.553
and pull up
kickinitteenstyle.com.

05:39.650 --> 05:41.536
- Their teen text tutor is very good.
- Oh, my God!

05:41.664 --> 05:42.705
Tell her you're putting
your baseball cards

05:42.784 --> 05:44.067
in your bike spokes.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.536
- No, no, you're playing charades
with your family. - Hello!

05:46.702 --> 05:48.123
Who in this room
has actually kissed anyone

05:48.241 --> 05:50.191
in the past 10 years
besides a gross mom?

05:50.282 --> 05:51.456
Brick, the correct response

05:51.549 --> 05:53.687
to "What are you doing?"
is "Nothin'."

05:53.817 --> 05:56.053
All lowercase, and don't you
dare put a "G" on the end.

05:58.612 --> 06:00.363
She said, "Cool."

06:00.491 --> 06:02.153
- Boom! It's on!
- Mmm. - Whoo!

06:02.254 --> 06:04.372
- Okay, okay. - Okay, what's
next? Got to keep it rolling.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.440
I'm gonna ask her
if she's read "Planet Nowhere."

06:06.549 --> 06:07.326
No!

06:07.419 --> 06:08.653
How about
her feelings on fonts?

06:08.742 --> 06:09.659
No!

06:10.200 --> 06:11.529
Don't I want her to know
the real me?!

06:11.621 --> 06:13.105
- No! - No! - No!
- Oh, God, no!

06:14.713 --> 06:16.262
She said,
"Are you still there?"

06:16.356 --> 06:18.401
We're losing her!
Come on, ticktock, people.

06:18.484 --> 06:19.665
The clock's running out.

06:19.818 --> 06:21.849
Can I ask her to go to
the Halloween dance with me?

06:23.436 --> 06:25.808
Huh.
What do you guys think?

06:25.896 --> 06:27.417
I like it.
It's a gutsy move.

06:27.478 --> 06:29.671
It's a little risky.
What if he scares her off?

06:29.743 --> 06:31.306
He already told her
he has diarrhea.

06:31.389 --> 06:32.623
He has nothing to lose.

06:32.972 --> 06:34.834
So, we're all in agreement?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.813
We're doing this?
We're going for it.

06:37.061 --> 06:39.249
We are going for it, people!

06:39.339 --> 06:40.582
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

06:40.692 --> 06:45.943
"Will you go
to the dance with me?"

06:46.089 --> 06:47.408
Sending?
I'm sending!

06:49.000 --> 06:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:57.648 --> 06:58.785
She said, "Yes"!

07:00.029 --> 07:01.734
Yeah! All right!

07:01.818 --> 07:03.225
- All right!
- Whoo!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.067
Okay, well,
I think we can all agree

07:11.160 --> 07:13.588
that trust falls
were a failed experiment.

07:13.695 --> 07:16.131
So, what do you guys
want to do?

07:16.856 --> 07:17.962
We could have a séance.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.998
Ooh!
Very Halloween-y.

07:21.122 --> 07:22.197
I like it!

07:22.410 --> 07:23.660
Becky, get the lights.

07:24.734 --> 07:27.180
So... what do we do?

07:27.292 --> 07:28.441
Uh, let's hold hands.

07:29.353 --> 07:31.780
Okay, first, we need to call
the spirit of a dead person.

07:31.889 --> 07:34.124
It's your house, so you should
probably make the call.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.749
Okay. Uh...

07:37.250 --> 07:38.979
Oh, spirits.

07:39.145 --> 07:40.415
I know this is your busy season

07:40.542 --> 07:42.048
with Halloween
coming up and all,

07:42.178 --> 07:43.360
but if it's cool with you,

07:43.553 --> 07:46.629
we would like to contact
the spirit of...

07:46.951 --> 07:49.124
Christopher Columbus!

07:49.244 --> 07:50.803
Christopher Columbus?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.470
He discovered America,
you guys,

07:52.656 --> 07:54.949
and I just love America
so much!

07:55.947 --> 07:59.092
Oh, spirits,
if Christopher Columbus

07:59.225 --> 08:01.464
is in the room with us
right now,

08:01.664 --> 08:05.103
please give us a sign--
any sign.

08:05.192 --> 08:06.704
Hear our call.

08:06.794 --> 08:09.887
Show us your spirit is here.

08:23.046 --> 08:24.475
'Sup?

08:26.233 --> 08:27.666
What's going on?

08:27.849 --> 08:30.012
I used to be able to land a girl
just with a "'Sup?"

08:30.094 --> 08:31.001
I once scored a barista

08:31.106 --> 08:32.833
with a wink
and a "What's kickin'?"

08:36.378 --> 08:38.414
You know what I miss?
I miss being cool.

08:38.511 --> 08:39.860
Yeah. Me, too.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.300
Hey, baby.
How's it going?

08:44.456 --> 08:45.637
You know what we got to do?

08:45.939 --> 08:46.701
What, go back to high school

08:46.820 --> 08:47.999
and pretend
we're still seniors?

08:48.118 --> 08:48.964
No.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.905
We got to throw a party
and let the hotties come to us.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.264
Yes, that's a genius plan,
my friend-- genius plan.

08:54.392 --> 08:58.161
Hey, ladies--
Halloween party, Willard 305!

08:58.518 --> 09:00.026
Tell your friends!

09:00.580 --> 09:03.295
So then, we're holding hands
for the séance, and I say,

09:03.448 --> 09:06.851
"If Christopher Columbus
is in the room right now"--

09:06.960 --> 09:09.308
Hang on.
Christopher Columbus?

09:09.975 --> 09:12.126
I'm 16, mom. I don't know
a lot of dead people.

09:12.314 --> 09:14.687
Anyway, we asked his spirit
for a sign.

09:14.792 --> 09:18.548
And all of a sudden,
I see the <i>Santa Maria</i>

09:18.666 --> 09:20.830
sail across our wood paneling.

09:21.075 --> 09:23.060
Check the liquor cabinet.

09:23.469 --> 09:26.243
Dad, this really happened.
I'm serious.

09:26.512 --> 09:29.107
I was sitting right there,
and I looked over at the wall,

09:29.228 --> 09:31.490
and there it was--
the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

09:31.861 --> 09:34.523
You sure it wasn't
the <i>Niña</i> or the <i>Pinta</i>

09:34.633 --> 09:36.126
or the Never Happened-a?

09:36.226 --> 09:39.622
Anyway, it was sort of light
and glowing and it sailed

09:39.736 --> 09:41.413
from the commemorative
royal baby goblet

09:41.522 --> 09:43.987
all the way to dad's
cornhole trophy.

09:44.216 --> 09:45.720
Who'd have thought?

09:45.836 --> 09:47.082
My very first séance,

09:47.158 --> 09:49.869
and I see an actual sign
from the beyond.

09:51.282 --> 09:52.874
I must be really good at it.

09:53.031 --> 09:54.908
- Mm.
- Mm.

09:56.145 --> 09:56.926
We might want to clear out

09:57.057 --> 09:58.625
the other half
of the basement for her.

10:00.921 --> 10:03.066
<i>So, Axl and Hutch threw</i>
<i>their first college party,</i>

10:03.173 --> 10:05.759
<i>and sure enough,</i>
<i>it was a huge success...</i>

10:06.146 --> 10:08.066
<i>right after they left</i>
<i>to make a snack run.</i>

10:08.274 --> 10:10.098
Oh, check it out.
Told you it would work.

10:10.626 --> 10:12.011
Pardon us--
our party.

10:12.093 --> 10:12.946
- Excuse us.
- You're welcome.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.162
Party hosts coming through.

10:14.373 --> 10:15.071
Oh!

10:16.562 --> 10:18.385
- Whoo!
- Hey, hey, you can't go in there.

10:18.503 --> 10:19.697
Oh, no, no, no, it's my party.

10:19.801 --> 10:21.279
I don't think so.
This is a football party.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.853
I know. We're football players.
Remember us?

10:23.937 --> 10:25.640
Yesterday, you made us
drink out of a mop bucket.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.065
Yeah, we just went out
to get some chips.

10:27.173 --> 10:28.618
Hey, hey, hey!
We got chips!

10:30.606 --> 10:31.562
Yeah!

10:32.236 --> 10:32.990
Oh, oh, come--

10:33.308 --> 10:35.586
You're seriously gonna keep me
out of my own party?!

10:35.730 --> 10:37.490
Oh, man!

10:37.888 --> 10:39.673
There's a hot chick
sitting right on my bed!

10:39.917 --> 10:41.460
Oh, and we got a slutty nurse!

10:41.580 --> 10:43.994
- What?
- And a slutty Alice In Wonderland!

10:44.157 --> 10:47.178
I don't even know what that is,
but it's definitely slutty.

10:54.556 --> 10:56.090
Hey.
I'm off to the dance.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.379
What are you supposed to be?

10:58.868 --> 11:00.001
Well, I'm a bookmark.

11:00.199 --> 11:01.501
Brick!

11:02.208 --> 11:03.088
I thought we agreed

11:03.179 --> 11:04.982
you were going to be
a gangster, remember?

11:05.101 --> 11:06.692
We talked about how cool
you'd look in a fedora

11:06.781 --> 11:08.611
and how much Harper
would like it.

11:08.748 --> 11:09.899
Yeah, but then I decided

11:10.001 --> 11:12.259
what sixth grader
doesn't love a bookmark?

11:12.406 --> 11:13.786
So, any
last-minute advice

11:13.896 --> 11:15.812
before I head off
to my first dance?

11:15.904 --> 11:16.744
Whoop!

11:16.830 --> 11:19.281
Just... just...

11:19.397 --> 11:20.934
Good luck.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.156
Trick or treat!

11:28.248 --> 11:29.395
Oh, come on.
You guys seriously

11:29.506 --> 11:31.854
ate all the licorice menorahs?

11:32.074 --> 11:34.931
The whole point
of buying this crap candy

11:35.016 --> 11:36.305
is so that we wouldn't eat it!

11:36.408 --> 11:37.974
We are the worst family ever!

11:38.049 --> 11:39.214
Trick or treat!

11:39.281 --> 11:40.754
Quick, hit the lights.
We got to hide.

11:42.522 --> 11:44.082
Mom, mom, I have to tell you
what happened today.

11:44.325 --> 11:45.333
Tell me in the laundry room!

11:45.453 --> 11:46.743
We're hiding from
the trick-or-treaters.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.482
Come on, open the door!

11:49.583 --> 11:50.883
So, at school today,

11:51.021 --> 11:52.963
I was telling everyone in class
about how I saw

11:53.080 --> 11:55.292
the ghost of the <i>Santa Maria</i>
<i>appear on our paneling.</i>

11:55.458 --> 11:56.195
Whoa.

11:56.262 --> 11:57.494
You told people about this?

11:57.699 --> 11:58.486
Yeah.

11:58.579 --> 12:00.138
So, then my biology teacher
said--

12:00.252 --> 12:02.809
- You told your teacher, too?
- Of course.

12:02.949 --> 12:04.717
I wanted to get
his scientific opinion

12:04.832 --> 12:07.090
on this supernatural phenomena.

12:07.249 --> 12:08.699
Anyway, I am getting

12:08.812 --> 12:11.260
so many different reactions
to this story.

12:12.458 --> 12:13.683
You know what?

12:13.824 --> 12:16.309
This would make a great article
for the student paper.

12:16.430 --> 12:17.736
I'm gonna go
jot down some notes.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.714
- Trick or treat!
- Belly crawl!

12:19.829 --> 12:21.049
I see you!

12:21.222 --> 12:23.094
Trick or treat!

12:23.726 --> 12:24.959
Open up!

12:25.947 --> 12:27.789
Okay, you got to stop her.

12:27.966 --> 12:28.829
From what?

12:28.926 --> 12:30.664
From sounding like an idiot,
Frankie.

12:30.753 --> 12:33.149
She's telling people she saw
Christopher Columbus on our wall.

12:33.247 --> 12:34.489
So what? She's excited.

12:34.572 --> 12:36.186
- Who cares?
- I care.

12:36.366 --> 12:39.234
It'd be fine if she was 5,
but she's 16 now.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.411
She's got to grow up, or people
are gonna think she's nuts.

12:41.568 --> 12:43.939
Okay, yes,
she's a little innocent

12:44.037 --> 12:45.478
compared to other girls
her age,

12:45.561 --> 12:47.463
but you should be happy
about that.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.036
She's sweet and trusting
and open to everything.

12:51.135 --> 12:52.751
That's what makes her Sue.

12:52.853 --> 12:55.390
Look, I don't want to change her.
I just want to protect her.

12:55.485 --> 12:56.893
I'm her dad.
That's my job.

12:57.096 --> 12:59.681
She can be herself
all she wants at home.

12:59.765 --> 13:02.826
But in public, she's just
got to dial down the Sue

13:02.921 --> 13:04.201
a little bit, you know?

13:04.306 --> 13:07.237
That's all-- just so people
don't laugh at her.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.013
Fine, we'll talk to her.

13:10.094 --> 13:11.605
I just want to be sensitive.

13:11.774 --> 13:15.491

of the "Tooth Fairy"

13:23.632 --> 13:24.529
starring the rock.

13:24.613 --> 13:26.267
It's funny, 'cause he's big
and he's a tooth fairy.

13:26.344 --> 13:30.057
No! I want to go to my party
in my room right now!

13:31.195 --> 13:32.912
I mean, eventually,
I do want to watch that movie,

the front of the house.

14:13.204 --> 14:14.979
It's a pumpkin crime scene
out there.

14:16.312 --> 14:18.968
So, how was the dance?
Did you talk to Harper?

14:19.081 --> 14:21.031
Come on, spill it.
Mama wants some deets.

14:21.114 --> 14:22.893
Well, she came up to me
and said "Hi."

14:23.026 --> 14:24.635
At that point,
I got sort of nervous,

14:24.764 --> 14:26.013
so my hands started to shake.

14:26.202 --> 14:28.161
Soon the shaking spread
to my whole body.

14:28.321 --> 14:30.811
I tried to stop it, but that's
when the dizziness set in.

14:31.005 --> 14:32.296
It's weird--
you always hear people say

14:32.406 --> 14:35.033
the room started spinning,
but it really did.

14:35.254 --> 14:37.289
I think that's about the time
I bit my tongue,

14:37.448 --> 14:38.906
'cause I tasted my own blood.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.592
At least I think
that was my blood--

14:40.694 --> 14:41.549
it could have been hers.

14:41.628 --> 14:43.229
I clawed her face pretty good
on the way down.

14:43.334 --> 14:44.204
The way down?

14:44.308 --> 14:45.719
Yeah, I took out
the whole snack table.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.389
Anyway, when I came to,

14:47.491 --> 14:49.198
I was getting oxygen
from the paramedics.

14:49.317 --> 14:51.142
Apparently, I banged my head
on the punch bowl.

14:51.241 --> 14:53.288
They said I'm supposed to
sleep upright tonight

14:53.391 --> 14:56.000
and you need to check my pupils
once an hour.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.711
Clearly, I am not ready
for a real relationship.

14:59.822 --> 15:01.001
Oh, well. We tried.

15:03.550 --> 15:04.520
Oh.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.552
They said I'm supposed to
sleep upright tonight

15:06.649 --> 15:08.782
and you need to check my pupils
once an hour.

15:09.455 --> 15:11.323
Did I mention that already?

15:12.545 --> 15:13.434
Hmm.

15:23.476 --> 15:26.778
Guess we're the last ones.
We should probably go.

15:26.888 --> 15:29.498
Oh. Uh, hey,
you can't leave yet.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.046
You haven't even
been to the beach.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.165
Uh, would you care to take

15:32.260 --> 15:34.821
a moonlit stroll on the sand?

15:39.786 --> 15:41.795
Okay, maybe I've had
too many jello shots,

15:41.891 --> 15:44.164
but this is really cool!

15:44.292 --> 15:47.377
We should go get our bikinis!

15:51.917 --> 15:52.934
Oh, my God.
Seriously?

15:53.013 --> 15:54.179
This is not happening!

15:54.245 --> 15:55.832
Okay, you know what?
That's it. We're done.

15:55.954 --> 15:59.439
No more jumping or flapping
or playing jockstrap gas mask.

15:59.518 --> 16:00.566
We are taking back our cool!

16:00.647 --> 16:01.521
Oh, yeah, we are.

16:01.609 --> 16:03.143
And besides, how are they
even gonna know?

16:03.272 --> 16:04.225
Uh, yeah.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.392
Pbht!

16:05.819 --> 16:08.096
So, you were saying something
about bikinis.

16:09.371 --> 16:12.301
Oh, God, no. No, no!

16:12.434 --> 16:14.702
No! Aah!

16:14.796 --> 16:17.283
- Ladies, we'll be right back.
- Come on!

16:17.383 --> 16:19.113
These boots
were made for walking!

16:20.357 --> 16:22.125
Yo, dude, that pirate girl
was totally into you.

16:22.215 --> 16:22.969
I could tell.

16:23.075 --> 16:23.801
Thanks, man.

16:23.872 --> 16:25.046
You were killing it
with that cowgirl.

16:25.123 --> 16:26.744
Yep! We're back!

16:26.830 --> 16:28.328
We are definitely back.

16:28.409 --> 16:29.288
High five!

16:34.324 --> 16:35.879
- I'll get you later.
- Yeah.

16:40.446 --> 16:42.997
Hey, guys, what do you think
about this for a headline?

16:43.128 --> 16:45.772
"The night I asked
Christopher Columbus for a sign

16:45.864 --> 16:47.386
and got the <i>Santa Maria,</i>

16:47.496 --> 16:50.390
AKA The Sue-ance,
colon,

16:50.519 --> 16:52.604
I'm not kidding.
It really happened.

16:52.691 --> 16:54.240
Dot, dot, dot--
it's true.

16:54.366 --> 16:55.728
I'm totally serious."

16:56.323 --> 16:57.914
I had another one,
but it was too long.

16:58.077 --> 16:59.764
Sue, uh,
before we hit the sack,

16:59.851 --> 17:02.176
we kind of wanted to
talk to you about all this.

17:02.924 --> 17:05.083
We know you think you saw...

17:05.637 --> 17:07.857
something,
a-and that's great.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.750
What's not so great is...

17:09.939 --> 17:12.818
the... you know,
telling people.

17:13.284 --> 17:14.079
Why not?

17:14.171 --> 17:15.502
'Cause it sounds a little nuts.

17:15.627 --> 17:17.461
But that's why
I have to tell people,

17:17.588 --> 17:19.800
because it's so unbelievable.

17:20.390 --> 17:22.767
You guys were supposed to check
my pupils an hour ago.

17:23.096 --> 17:23.769
Oh.

17:26.342 --> 17:27.549
You're fine.

17:28.449 --> 17:31.212
I'm telling you,
I saw the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

17:31.346 --> 17:34.180
It was white and glowing
and sailed right across

17:34.291 --> 17:35.950
the paneling
in our family room.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.330
Okay, Sue, let's be honest.

17:37.445 --> 17:39.257
That could be a million things.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.663
- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know-- the Moon, a shadow,

17:41.813 --> 17:43.803
the headlights of a car
coming up the street.

17:43.921 --> 17:47.333
Dad, headlights don't look like
the ships of famous explorers.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.561
Honey, we all think
we've seen strange things.

17:50.712 --> 17:53.314
You know, when I was little,
I looked out my window,

17:53.425 --> 17:55.639
and I swear to God, I saw a UFO

17:55.707 --> 17:58.013
beam our trash can
up into the spaceship.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.840
Really? Wait.
Can I quote you for my article?

17:59.938 --> 18:01.846
No, no-- the point is,

18:02.002 --> 18:04.238
even though it seemed
very real at the time,

18:04.393 --> 18:05.701
I know it wasn't.

18:05.803 --> 18:07.543
Well, that might be because
time is a circle,

18:07.647 --> 18:09.142
but it's also sometimes a line.

18:09.315 --> 18:11.506
See, you're either experiencing
something in the past

18:11.602 --> 18:13.050
that you would have experienced
in the future,

18:13.210 --> 18:15.235
or you're remembering something
that already happened

18:15.342 --> 18:16.814
that you haven't seen yet.

18:17.218 --> 18:19.312
Also, did you know
that you can taste colors?

18:21.467 --> 18:23.308
You guys, I know what I saw.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.746
Yeah, well, sometimes our mind
plays tricks on us.

18:26.845 --> 18:27.952
Like one time, I woke up,

18:28.059 --> 18:30.621
and saw an old woman
sitting at the end of my bed.

18:30.983 --> 18:32.030
But you don't hear me
talking about it.

18:32.215 --> 18:34.975
What?
You never told me that.

18:35.284 --> 18:36.387
'Cause there's nothing to tell.

18:36.495 --> 18:39.035
Well, obviously,
there's something to tell.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.019
Eh, it was nothing.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.677
She was sitting there.
She looked straight at me.

18:41.778 --> 18:43.972
We stared at each other
for a minute. End of story.

18:44.050 --> 18:45.421
What did she look like?

18:45.853 --> 18:46.588
I don't know.

18:46.683 --> 18:48.694
She was wearing an old-timey
robe kind of thing.

18:48.788 --> 18:50.045
But that's not my point.
My point is

18:50.157 --> 18:51.895
that it didn't happen,
and that's--

18:51.983 --> 18:53.806
So, you don't know who it was?

18:53.964 --> 18:54.757
No.

18:54.831 --> 18:57.432
I mean, she looked like
my grandma, but...

18:57.516 --> 18:59.408
- Your grandma?!
- Yeah.

18:59.489 --> 19:01.159
She was wearing
kind of a big pin.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.676
A pin?

19:02.776 --> 19:04.066
You mean like the one
in every single picture

19:04.167 --> 19:06.114
I have ever seen
of your grandmother?

19:06.225 --> 19:07.532
Did she say anything?

19:07.606 --> 19:09.116
No, just...

19:09.221 --> 19:12.566
Well, she said, uh,
"Everything's gonna be okay,"

19:12.760 --> 19:15.307
- but that was really it.
- Oh, my God!

19:15.350 --> 19:17.619
Now I totally believe
I saw the <i>Santa Maria!</i>

19:17.883 --> 19:19.820
No-- look,
what I'm saying is,

19:19.924 --> 19:22.293
my grandma was probably
just on my mind.

19:22.481 --> 19:24.262
So I was thinking about her.
That's all.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.199
Or your dead grandmother
came to see you

19:26.312 --> 19:27.479
in the middle of the night.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.210
Frankie, it never happened.

19:29.292 --> 19:31.206
And you know how I know?
Because she's dead.

19:31.551 --> 19:33.497
It was just my mind
playing tricks on me,

19:33.588 --> 19:35.020
and I don't go around
telling people about it

19:35.117 --> 19:37.097
because it sounds insane.

19:37.183 --> 19:39.299
No, it sounds incredible!

19:39.598 --> 19:43.257
I mean, there are so many
beautiful, amazing things

19:43.357 --> 19:46.464
that happen every day
that sound crazy.

19:46.711 --> 19:47.544
Think about it.

19:47.659 --> 19:49.979
If I had to explain the miracle
of how babies are born

19:50.076 --> 19:53.638
to someone who didn't know,
wouldn't I sound insane?

19:53.741 --> 19:54.655
Yeah, but--

19:54.737 --> 19:55.665
And stars.

19:55.784 --> 19:57.648
I read that
when a star explodes,

19:57.789 --> 20:00.357
the dust they find
is the same thing

20:00.446 --> 20:05.013
that makes up humans, animals,
the entire universe.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.383
How amazing is that?

20:06.516 --> 20:10.448
The same stardust is
in everything and everyone--

20:10.563 --> 20:13.907
me, you,
even Christopher Columbus.

20:14.021 --> 20:15.361
You know, in his day,

20:15.473 --> 20:17.451
some people still thought
the world was flat.

20:17.563 --> 20:20.493
Columbus said it was round,
and people thought he was crazy.

20:20.707 --> 20:22.648
Look, I know there's
always gonna be doubters,

20:22.767 --> 20:24.499
but it just takes someone
who thinks,

20:24.661 --> 20:26.249
"Why can't it be true?"

20:26.397 --> 20:30.248
to truly change the world,
and I am one of those people.

20:30.461 --> 20:34.431
So how can you sit there
on this planet made of stardust

20:34.527 --> 20:36.161
that was once thought
to be flat

20:36.296 --> 20:39.691
and still not think
anything is possible?

20:40.861 --> 20:42.253
Because it isn't.

20:42.514 --> 20:44.157
Now let's go. It's late.
Time for bed.

20:50.808 --> 20:53.912
<i>That night, as everyone</i>
<i>drifted off to sleep,</i>

20:54.710 --> 20:57.791
<i>what Sue had said</i>
<i>was in all our minds...</i>

21:00.945 --> 21:02.574
<i>...some more than others.</i>

21:23.073 --> 21:24.546
<i>Was it headlights?</i>

21:25.039 --> 21:26.910
<i>The ghost of the</i> Santa Maria?

21:27.472 --> 21:29.563
<i>Or even a little bit</i>
<i>of stardust?</i>

21:30.128 --> 21:31.223
<i>Who knows?</i>

21:32.241 --> 21:33.694
<i>Anything is possible.</i>
