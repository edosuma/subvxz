00:02.044 --> 00:04.170
Previously on Lost:

00:05.714 --> 00:08.800
The plane was loaded with heroin.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.428
- He said he found it in the jungle.
- Where?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.931
- It's just a statue.
- Just a statue?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.603
Where is Charlie?

00:20.688 --> 00:24.941
What's this?
Because this was in your little statue.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.693
I didn't know.

00:26.777 --> 00:30.405
If it's sealed up inside a statue,
how would I know?

00:35.119 --> 00:37.995
- You lied to me.
- I'm sorry.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.832
- I can't have you around my baby.
- Claire...

00:40.916 --> 00:43.668
I don't want you
sleeping anywhere near us.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.257
Voltron.

01:36.972 --> 01:40.266
Where are my presents?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.644
Right over here, Charlie.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.619
It's a piano.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.914
- This is mine?
- Yes.

02:02.998 --> 02:06.167
Father Christmas
must've known how talented you are.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.257
You're special, love.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.886
Someday you're gonna get us out of here.
All of us.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.306
Now...

02:21.141 --> 02:23.893
Go on. Play us a tune.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.563
Come on, baby brother.

02:29.024 --> 02:33.110
You can't save your family
if you don't play.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.114
Come on, play.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.701
Play me a tune.
Come on, now, let's hear it.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.581
He ain't saving no one.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.960
Music will never get you anywhere,
Charlie boy.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.297
- You need a trade.
- Dad?

02:54.842 --> 02:57.718
Do it, baby bro. Save us.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.721
Save us, Charlie. Save us.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.619
Aaron?

03:30.752 --> 03:33.087
It's OK. It's all right.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.666
Sun. Have you seen Claire and the baby?
They've gone.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.294
- They're right over there.
- Is Aaron OK?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.254
Yes, he's fine. Charlie, he's...

05:12.145 --> 05:14.146
It's OK.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.736
Hey.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.993
I made Aaron some nappies this morning.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.329
I'll just put those there.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.957
Thanks.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.880
Has he been asking about me?

05:39.965 --> 05:42.425
Charlie, don't.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.349
I'm sorry.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.352
I should have told you about the statue,

05:53.437 --> 05:55.438
and what was in it.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.693
I just wish things could get back
to the way they were before.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.320
There is no "before."

06:05.073 --> 06:07.783
We were strangers on a plane
and became friends.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.618
Now Locke's your friend, huh?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.502
Please, Charlie.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.422
Just for now, give me some space, OK?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.593
Space.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.145
See you, mate. Take care of your mum.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.623
- Charlie?
- Hey.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.337
What are you doing up?
You should be lying down.

07:01.421 --> 07:06.050
I just needed to see her again.
Isn't she brilliant?

07:08.512 --> 07:11.597
She's beautiful, Karen.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.016
I named her Megan.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.146
Where's Liam?

07:22.317 --> 07:26.320
- He's not here.
- It wasn't his fault.

07:26.404 --> 07:30.074
We were leaving Dresden. I was in a cab.
He was in a van with the gear.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.244
It blew a tire
on the way to the airport.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.872
He missed his flight.
But he's on the next plane.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.959
- He'll be here soon.
- But he's OK?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.587
He's great. He's a dad.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.570
For the... Liam.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.823
Unbelievable.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.826
Liam?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.831
Wake up. Oi!

08:18.915 --> 08:23.335
What the hell's wrong with you?
What the hell are you doing?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.255
- Baby brother.
- You're supposed to be cleaning up.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.634
Get up.
I told Karen you missed your flight.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.596
She's alone at the hospital
and you're here fixing.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.224
I'm cool.
I just needed to get right, that's all.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.977
Don't worry. I left you some.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.691
Get right? Why don't you get up?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.861
Take a shower, get dressed,
get to the hospital?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.947
All right. I'm on it.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.577
By the way, you have a daughter.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.332
Her name's Megan.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.544
After Mum?

09:06.630 --> 09:09.173
After Mum.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.134
Now clean yourself up.
You're a sodding father now.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.932
Easy. That's good. That was good.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.893
- One more.
- Sawyer.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.021
When you were over there
across the island,

09:24.105 --> 09:26.440
how well did you get to know
those Tailies?

09:26.524 --> 09:30.778
- Well enough. Why?
- That Libby chick seems pretty cool.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.699
I mean, is she?

09:35.784 --> 09:39.286
You got a little love connection
brewing over there, Jabba?

09:40.830 --> 09:44.583
- No. I'm just asking.
- I hear you asking.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.337
Forget it.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.384
What's with you? You're acting
like you're in junior high.

09:59.349 --> 10:04.103
What do we have here?
Ana Lucia's getting the $20 tour.

10:04.187 --> 10:08.190
That's the third time I've seen them
walking out of the jungle.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.445
What do you suppose they're doing?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.572
You just do your exercises.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.748
Bloody hell.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.100
The baby!

10:44.853 --> 10:46.562
Help!

10:50.066 --> 10:52.109
The baby!

11:01.911 --> 11:03.871
Aaron.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.594
I'm coming. It's OK.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.017
Just hang on.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.111
I got you. It's all right. It's OK.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.989
You're OK now. You're safe.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.786
It's OK.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.919
Mum?

11:52.003 --> 11:53.545
Claire?

11:53.630 --> 11:57.549
- He's in danger. You have to save him.
- You have to save the baby.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.135
Only you can save him.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.904
- What are you doing?
- What?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.990
What are you doing, man?

12:22.075 --> 12:25.661
- What's going on?
- What are you doing with the baby?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.921
I don't know.

12:36.548 --> 12:40.217
Help! Somebody took my baby!
Aaron's gone.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.719
It's OK. We're over here.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.265
Is he all right?

12:48.518 --> 12:51.854
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.445
He's OK, though. I had this dream...

13:19.966 --> 13:23.719
Stick? I don't know, dude.
Don't I need 21? I think I should hit.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.891
- But I got a six. I'm gonna bust.
- How do you know that?

13:28.975 --> 13:32.227
I don't. But you gotta assume
that I'm gonna bust.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.896
Why?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.905
Well, well,
look who's off to the Laundromat.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.868
Go on.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.331
I'm sure you've got a load
you need to drop in, Jethro.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.125
I'm kind of waiting for my moment.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.670
Well...

13:59.923 --> 14:03.175
Your moment is now, Hoss.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.678
Hey, Libby.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.020
Hey, yourself.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.746
Hey, John. Talk to you for a second?

14:33.581 --> 14:35.541
What is it?

14:35.625 --> 14:38.418
I take it you heard about
what happened last night?

14:38.503 --> 14:42.506
You taking the baby out of Claire's tent
in the middle of the night?

14:42.590 --> 14:45.551
- I heard.
- It was a big misunderstanding.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.011
I was sleepwalking.
I don't know how or why.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.931
Is there something you want from me?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.475
I was hoping
you could speak to Claire for me.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.894
Put in a good word.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.646
Are you using?

14:58.940 --> 15:01.358
- What?
- Heroin. Are you using again?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.488
Kate sees a horse, nothing.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.491
Pretty much everybody's seen Walt
in the jungle.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.868
When it's Charlie, it must be the drugs.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.247
It's funny,
you didn't answer the question.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.624
You remember the plane?

15:17.709 --> 15:21.837
We burned it. Eko and me.
We burned the whole thing.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.674
The heroin, the statues.
It's all gone, destroyed.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.137
- All of them?
- All of them.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.271
Trust is a hard thing to win back.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.898
Claire needs time.

15:41.983 --> 15:45.027
You should leave her
and the baby alone for a while.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.341
Can you do this? You look green.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.635
Sod off. I'm fine.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.304
Let's give this another go, shall we?

16:12.388 --> 16:16.183
Get it together.
Lest you forget, we need this.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.268
Tea.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.688
- So, you lads ready?
- We're ready. Let's go.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.733
- Let's try not to blow it this time.
- You good?

16:24.817 --> 16:28.195
We've only 20 minutes
till we're in overtime. Get it right.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.955
All right.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.833
- Camera. Rotate on the eight count.
- Rolling.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.543
Hold the product up.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.837
- Butties diapers, take 53.
- Playback.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.799
- Mark it.
- And action.

17:00.603 --> 17:06.650
You all, every butties

17:07.068 --> 17:08.859
- Acting like...
- Cut.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.864
- It's all right.
- That's it. We're wrapped.

17:12.949 --> 17:16.201
No. Mate. Hang on. Wait.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.915
- What are you doing?
- Let's not waste any more time.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.669
You were only hired as a favor
to your lawyer. I wanted Dirt Spigot.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.755
Come on, mate. Give us another chance.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.758
You want another chance?
Take my advice.

17:31.843 --> 17:34.845
Ditch that one. He's a bloody disaster.

17:37.390 --> 17:41.893
I'm not ditching anyone.
He's my brother.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.355
Right. Well, then, I guess you're fired.

17:47.442 --> 17:51.403
Is this washer and dryer
newer than everything else in here?

17:51.487 --> 17:54.573
It washes clothes.
That's all I need to know.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.326
Finally. Someone who keeps it simple.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.912
Look at this.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.874
I got it in some of
the abandoned luggage.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.002
You think I can pull this off?

18:10.131 --> 18:11.965
Let me give you a hint.

18:12.049 --> 18:17.304
When a girl asks that kind of question,
she's looking for validation.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.641
Do I know you from somewhere?

18:25.021 --> 18:27.355
You mean other than the flight?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.776
- The flight...
- Turn around.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.570
Turn around. I'm gonna try it on.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.947
- Sure, go ahead.
- No peeking.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.624
I cannot believe you don't remember
stepping on my foot.

18:45.708 --> 18:49.336
- I did?
- Yes, you did. And it was hard.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.839
I remember you were
the last one on the flight,

18:52.924 --> 18:56.176
and you were all sweaty
and you had headphones on

18:56.260 --> 19:01.139
and crunch, you stepped on my foot.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.017
Turn around.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.527
- What do you think?
- It's awesome.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.739
Thanks.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.833
What are you doing?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.918
I'm marking trees.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.421
Why?

19:35.424 --> 19:38.760
Because these are the ones I like.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.141
Did you tell Locke
you gave me a statue from the plane?

19:45.226 --> 19:47.978
Why would I do that?

19:48.062 --> 19:51.940
He knows, man.
That bald wanker knows something.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.403
Is something wrong?

19:56.487 --> 19:59.698
Apart from me losing my mind?
No. Everything's peachy.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.158
Why would you say
you are losing your mind?

20:02.243 --> 20:05.078
How about the fact
that I've been sleepwalking?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.372
Stealing babies from their cribs?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.751
And the vivid dreams
that make me feel like I'm awake

20:11.836 --> 20:15.088
until, of course, I wake up.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.720
What are your dreams about?

20:21.804 --> 20:24.472
Variations of Aaron
being in mortal peril.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.685
Trapped in a piano.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.729
Drifting out to sea.

20:30.813 --> 20:34.399
There's the flying dove, and Claire
and my mum dressed as angels

20:34.483 --> 20:36.651
telling me I need to save the baby.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.242
What?

20:45.494 --> 20:50.206
Have you ever considered
that these dreams mean something?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.251
Like what?

20:53.336 --> 20:56.129
What if you do need to save the baby?

21:04.013 --> 21:06.514
- I have to talk to her.
- Now's not a good time.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.226
- She'll wanna hear this.
- Tell me and I will tell her.

21:10.311 --> 21:15.231
- Not now.
- Please. Aaron's in danger.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.484
- What?
- The baby's in danger.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.904
I've been having these dreams.
I know what they mean now.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.949
We have to baptize Aaron.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.242
- What?
- We can do this. Eko's a priest.

21:26.327 --> 21:30.455
- It's time to go.
- Wait. We have to baptize Aaron.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.708
He's in danger. We've got to do this.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.900
Here. For when it rains.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.153
Thanks.

22:14.458 --> 22:18.586
When are you gonna tell me
what happened in the jungle?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.756
I already did.
Pull it tighter, or it'll sag.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.346
You told me what that guy said.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.434
You didn't tell me
what made you turn around.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.894
What made you come back.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.063
He had a gun at Kate's head.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.279
You hitting that?

22:45.740 --> 22:50.744
- What?
- Plane crash. You both survived.

22:50.828 --> 22:54.330
Nice beach. She's hot, you're hot.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.207
That's what people do.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.879
I'm not "hitting that."

24:28.634 --> 24:30.635
Hey.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.515
Karen kicked me out, man.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.519
What?

24:42.231 --> 24:44.732
What happened?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.319
She thinks I'm dangerous.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.908
Why would she think that?

24:55.244 --> 24:58.997
Because I dropped her. I dropped Megan.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.171
Liam, it's all right.

25:07.298 --> 25:10.049
We've got no money. We've got nothing.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.180
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll get through this.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.849
Yeah? How's that?

25:19.018 --> 25:21.019
I'm writing again.

25:21.103 --> 25:25.648
I got a new song.
It's about two brothers.

25:25.733 --> 25:29.861
- Who should've been butchers.
- Don't say that. This is a good one.

25:29.945 --> 25:34.449
I feel like this might be the one.
Listen to this.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.039
Nice, man.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.166
- This could work.
- It's good, right?

26:25.251 --> 26:30.046
We could make it work.
Write all night, just like the old days.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.218
So, baby brother,

26:36.095 --> 26:39.138
you got any?

26:41.475 --> 26:44.477
I'm disappointed in you.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.651
- You followed me?
- How long you been coming out here?

26:52.194 --> 26:54.237
You've got the wrong idea, man.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.198
You said you destroyed them
and yet here they are.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.576
I came to finish the job,
to get rid of these.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.996
Very convenient,
now that I've found them.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.623
What are you doing?

27:05.708 --> 27:08.376
There was a time when I let you choose

27:08.460 --> 27:12.505
whether or not
you were gonna do this to yourself.

27:14.216 --> 27:18.094
- Now I'm making that choice for you.
- You don't believe me?

27:18.178 --> 27:21.055
Give them to me right now.
I'll destroy them.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.017
I'll throw them in the sodding wind.

27:24.101 --> 27:27.186
I know I lied. Just wait.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.232
Remember all those talks we had?
You and me?

27:31.317 --> 27:34.193
You said
everything happens for a reason.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.447
This island tests us.

27:37.531 --> 27:41.159
That's what this is. This is my test.
That's why these are here.

27:41.243 --> 27:44.579
These are here
because you put them here.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.747
Wait.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.835
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tell Claire?

27:51.712 --> 27:54.172
You can't. If she sees them, I'm done.

27:54.256 --> 27:57.050
She'll never trust me again,
and she has to.

27:57.134 --> 28:01.804
It's about the baby.
Aaron's in danger.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.809
You have to believe me.

28:06.894 --> 28:10.229
You've given up the right
to be believed.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.289
Hey.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.415
Hi.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.877
- How's our boy?
- He's good.

28:35.172 --> 28:38.383
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.718
Do you think Aaron and I

28:40.803 --> 28:44.138
could stay in the bedroom
in the hatch for a while?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.727
Alarm goes off every hour and a half.

28:49.812 --> 28:54.148
It's not the best place for a baby
to sleep through the night.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.859
Yeah, sure.

28:59.696 --> 29:03.491
How about if I move my stuff down here,
set up right next to your tent?

29:05.160 --> 29:07.412
That'd be great. Thanks.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.915
Then consider it done.

29:12.668 --> 29:17.505
You don't know anything
about baptism, do you?

29:17.589 --> 29:20.675
Not a whole lot. Why?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.760
Charlie came by my tent before.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.306
He told me Aaron had to be baptized.

29:31.145 --> 29:33.146
That he was in danger.

29:35.858 --> 29:41.112
My understanding is baptism is about
making sure children get into heaven,

29:41.196 --> 29:43.197
should anything happen.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.785
Call it spiritual insurance.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.625
There isn't any danger. Charlie just...

30:01.467 --> 30:04.719
Charlie just feels
like he has to save the baby

30:04.803 --> 30:07.305
because he can't save himself.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.852
- I'll see you tonight.
- OK.

31:00.442 --> 31:03.152
Charlie, can you give us a hand?

31:03.237 --> 31:05.738
Now's not a good time, Sayid.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.824
Let's lift this.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.910
I got it.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.754
- Fire!
- Where?

31:22.714 --> 31:25.967
Grab tools, containers for sand,
anything you have.

31:26.051 --> 31:29.262
If we don't stop it now,
it'll burn right through the camp.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.684
Stay here with Aaron.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.400
We need to cut a fire break right here.
Form a bucket line.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.236
Some of you people, down to the water.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.530
Sawyer.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.199
You're heading them off. Right here.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.566
Liam?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.778
My piano.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.907
What's going on?

32:34.703 --> 32:36.954
Where's my piano?

32:37.039 --> 32:38.831
I sold it.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.709
You what?

32:42.336 --> 32:44.295
- Wait.
- Get off me.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.922
Where's the money?
Is it up your sodding arm?

32:47.007 --> 32:49.133
I'm clean. I haven't used in two days.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.261
Two days? Happy anniversary.

32:52.346 --> 32:56.349
- How long you been clean?
- Where's the money?

32:56.433 --> 32:59.393
She was gonna leave me.
She was gonna take Megan.

33:00.437 --> 33:04.273
- What did you do?
- Karen's got an uncle in Australia.

33:04.358 --> 33:07.610
He's gonna get me a job.
There's a rehab clinic in Sydney.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.196
I just needed the money to get us there.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.325
I have to do this.

33:14.409 --> 33:18.663
I have to take care of myself,
for them, for my family.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.584
I'm your family.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.170
Wait. Will you just wait?

33:26.254 --> 33:29.006
- I can't.
- What about the band?

33:29.091 --> 33:31.092
What about the song?

33:34.096 --> 33:36.681
Try to understand. I have to go.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.849
I have to.

33:38.934 --> 33:44.563
I'll give you a call
when things settle down for me.

33:44.648 --> 33:49.276
For you? What about me?
What about my family?

33:49.361 --> 33:51.737
What about my family?

34:21.143 --> 34:24.061
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what I have to do.

34:24.146 --> 34:28.899
- He's got my baby. Stop it.
- It's all right. It's not...

34:28.984 --> 34:30.192
Help! Help!

34:30.277 --> 34:33.027
Somebody, help! He's got my baby!

34:34.781 --> 34:37.992
Come on, please. Stop.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.909
I just want to save him.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.204
- Charlie!
- It's all right.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.625
Give me the baby.

34:49.963 --> 34:53.757
Eko, tell them.
Tell them what you told me.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.135
That the baby has to be baptized.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.721
This is not the way.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.142
Give him to me.

35:03.226 --> 35:07.480
Who the hell are you?
Aaron's not your responsibility.

35:07.564 --> 35:11.025
Where were you when he was born?
When he was taken?

35:11.109 --> 35:14.820
You're not his father.
You're not his family.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.782
Neither are you.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.456
I have to do this. I need to.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.959
I'm not gonna hurt him.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.170
You're hurting me.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.204
I'm sorry.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.546
You need stitches.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.561
Try to be still.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.700
I started the fire.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.287
Yeah, I know.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.415
I was desperate.

37:31.499 --> 37:35.252
I need to know you're never gonna
do anything like this again. Ever.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.258
I know what this looks like,
what people think.

37:42.344 --> 37:45.930
It doesn't matter now, but I didn't use.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.644
I wanted to.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.813
I really wanted to.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.983
But I didn't.

38:00.195 --> 38:03.238
That's not what I asked.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.201
It's not gonna happen again.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.415
Charlie told me you're a priest.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.921
He said you told him
that I had to have...

39:01.006 --> 39:03.549
I did not tell Charlie
to do what he did.

39:04.426 --> 39:07.428
I'm sorry if he misunderstood me.

39:10.807 --> 39:14.059
But do you think
the baby has to be baptized?

39:15.228 --> 39:17.354
Do you know what baptism is?

39:18.857 --> 39:21.066
It's what gets you into heaven.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.867
It is said that when
John the Baptist baptized Jesus,

39:29.951 --> 39:35.164
the skies opened up
and a dove flew down from the sky.

39:35.248 --> 39:38.042
This told John something,

39:38.126 --> 39:40.836
that he had cleansed this man
of all his sins,

39:40.920 --> 39:43.422
that he had freed him.

39:46.176 --> 39:48.719
Heaven came much later.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.306
I haven't been baptized.

39:54.267 --> 39:59.354
Does that mean if you do it to Aaron
and something happened to us,

40:00.774 --> 40:03.192
that we wouldn't be together?

40:07.155 --> 40:10.199
Not if I baptize you both.
