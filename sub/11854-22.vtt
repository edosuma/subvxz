WEBVTT

00:06.625 --> 00:09.709
(male #1)
'Keep those arms out
of that water, private!'

00:10.959 --> 00:13.083
I do not want to see
your elbows touch!

00:13.166 --> 00:14.709
Do you understand?

00:14.792 --> 00:17.083
Sir, I can't! Uh..

00:17.166 --> 00:18.625
(male #1)
'"Can't?"'

00:20.834 --> 00:22.917
Can't is not in your vocabulary!

00:23.792 --> 00:25.417
'Failure is not an option'

00:26.667 --> 00:29.000
Failure is not an option,
Private Kasher.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.750
Do you understand me?

00:30.834 --> 00:31.875
Sir, yes, sir.

00:31.959 --> 00:33.417
Sixty seconds!

00:33.500 --> 00:34.417
Go!

00:34.500 --> 00:36.333
59, 58

00:36.417 --> 00:40.583
(all)
57, 56, 55

00:40.667 --> 00:43.041
'54..'

00:45.625 --> 00:48.000
Private Kasher?

00:48.083 --> 00:48.959
Private Kasher!

00:53.166 --> 00:54.500
'Private Kasher?'

01:24.458 --> 01:26.000
It's the tenth time
you checked that thing.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.959
Well, she was supposed
to call at nine.

01:28.041 --> 01:29.041
Elisa.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.667
It's 9:07.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.834
Well, she's
seven
minutes late.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.834
That a regular thing?

01:35.917 --> 01:36.959
Elisa calling in?

01:37.041 --> 01:38.875
No, no. It's a..

01:38.959 --> 01:40.542
Yeah, I mean..

01:40.625 --> 01:43.083
...she was doing so good,
and then I don't know.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.542
I don't know
what's happening.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.667
Where were you?

01:50.083 --> 01:51.542
(Will)
Lil.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.125
Questioned documents
kicked this one over.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.750
- Wants us to take a look.
- 'Cold job?'

01:54.834 --> 01:56.166
(Will)
'Doesn't match any live
ones.'

01:56.250 --> 01:59.000
It was mailed
anonymously into
homicide.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.750
Letterhead's from the
Wilkes
Military Academy for boys.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.458
The boot camp boarding
school in Roxborough?

02:03.542 --> 02:05.750
Mm-hmm. State run,
scared straight
central.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.875
Parents who can't
control their bad
boys

02:07.959 --> 02:09.250
'dump 'em there.'

02:09.333 --> 02:11.417
- What is it?
- Some kind of list.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.458
"The plan."

02:12.542 --> 02:14.125
"Number one, ignore.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.291
"Number two, reward.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.500
Number three, secret."

02:16.583 --> 02:17.709
"Number four, test.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.208
Number five,
escalate. Six.."

02:21.041 --> 02:23.000
Destroy."

02:23.083 --> 02:24.542
(Scotty)
'What the
hell?'

02:24.625 --> 02:26.250
It could be some
kind of shorthand?

02:26.333 --> 02:27.709
Question is what for?

02:27.792 --> 02:29.917
Mailed in homicide.
What else?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.083
Documents went over it?

02:31.166 --> 02:32.375
No fingerprints.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.291
Sender didn't even
spit on the seal.

02:35.375 --> 02:38.583
"May 15, 1999. Nash."

02:38.667 --> 02:41.458
Well, maybe Nash is the writer.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.291
Or the victim.

03:15.834 --> 03:16.792
So the doer's feelin' the guilt.

03:16.875 --> 03:17.959
Mails it in.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.750
Or some bystander finds it.

03:19.834 --> 03:20.917
Wants to do the right thing.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.166
It could be a frame job.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.875
Why send it five
years after the fact?

03:23.959 --> 03:27.250
Problem is, we got no murders
in the hundred some years

03:27.333 --> 03:29.583
'Wilkes Military
Academy's been around.'

03:29.667 --> 03:31.959
No body with a Nash toe tag.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.709
Wasn't classified as a homicide.

03:33.792 --> 03:34.959
"Accidental death.

03:35.041 --> 03:37.792
"Wilkes Military Academy,
May 15, 1999.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.458
Nash Cavanaugh.
Thirty five years old."

03:41.291 --> 03:43.333
(Lilly)
Hmm...drowning.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.333
Well, guy was liquored up good.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.250
"Blood alcohol content .30."

03:47.333 --> 03:50.250
Questioned documents took
a stab at who sent this plan
in?

03:50.333 --> 03:52.709
Uh, handwriting analysis
suggests a kid wrote it.

03:52.792 --> 03:55.875
Other than that, we got nothin'.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.500
A night duty sergeant

03:57.583 --> 03:59.792
James Creighton, found the body.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.375
Maybe we start with him.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.709
Cavanaugh's death was
classified as
accidental.

04:07.792 --> 04:09.709
We conducted our
own
investigation.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.458
And now, we're
conducting ours.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.166
Well, Sergeant Creighton was

04:14.250 --> 04:15.917
the duty sergeant
on rounds that night.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.500
Tell them what
you know, Creighton.

04:17.583 --> 04:20.166
Sir, yes sir. I found
Lieutenant Cavanaugh at 0600.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.667
Negative vital signs.
No response to CPR.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.625
Creighton was in Iraq.

04:24.709 --> 04:26.041
'Earned the bronze star.'

04:26.125 --> 04:30.333
- Ever seen this, colonel?
- No.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.625
How about you,
Sergeant Creighton?

04:35.125 --> 04:36.375
I never seen that, ma'am.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.667
Ignore, reward, secret

04:37.750 --> 04:38.834
test, escalate, destroy.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.166
That mean anything
to you, colonel?

04:40.250 --> 04:41.875
Nothing at all.

04:41.959 --> 04:44.792
(Scotty)
'Were you aware that Nash
was a drinker, colonel?'

04:44.875 --> 04:47.458
[scoffs]
It never
interfered
with his duties

04:47.542 --> 04:48.959
Lieutenant was respected.

04:49.041 --> 04:51.041
- Knew how to deal with slop.
- "Slop?"

04:51.125 --> 04:52.792
(male #2)
'Kids who come here.'

04:52.875 --> 04:55.709
Drug addicts, hoodlums,
cons in the making.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.583
Nash turned slop into men.

04:57.667 --> 05:00.166
(male #1)
Can't is not in your
vocabulary!

05:00.250 --> 05:02.750
Failure is not
an option, Private Kasher.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.458
Do you understand me?

05:06.125 --> 05:07.625
Sixty seconds!

05:07.709 --> 05:11.083
59, 58, 57

05:11.166 --> 05:14.542
56, 55, 54.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.083
'Private Kasher!'

05:17.166 --> 05:18.500
Private!

05:19.709 --> 05:22.125
Is there a problem
here, lieutenant?

05:22.208 --> 05:23.542
No, sir.

05:23.625 --> 05:24.792
Then carry on.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.333
Private LaSalle,
get him out of there.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.291
Dismissed.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.250
'Passed.'

05:41.333 --> 05:44.417
- But I didn't do it, sir.
- You never will.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.417
Please, just give me one
more chance, sir, please.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.625
I can do it.
I know I can,
sir!

05:49.709 --> 05:50.917
Please!

05:52.375 --> 05:54.166
One more chance, sir.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.291
Please, I can do it.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.583
I know I can.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.417
Please, sir.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.542
"From the child, comes
forth the soldier."

06:10.458 --> 06:11.917
'Cavanaugh made that happen.'

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
By almost drowning a child?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.792
[scoffs]
Private Jerry Kasher

06:15.875 --> 06:17.709
was and always
will be a bad seed.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.667
Not even Cavanaugh
could change that.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.458
This Private Kasher, he
ever
make any threats on Nash?

06:22.542 --> 06:25.291
No. But he threatened
other cadets.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.250
How?

06:26.333 --> 06:27.625
Torching their bunks..

06:27.709 --> 06:29.375
...with them in it.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.458
Private Kasher's
got 30-some hours

06:32.542 --> 06:33.792
to walk off before graduation.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.083
- Private Kasher!
- 'Walk off?'

06:36.166 --> 06:38.083
(Creighton)
'Tour of punishment.
Front and center!'

06:40.417 --> 06:42.250
You need some
weaponry 101, private?

06:42.333 --> 06:43.583
No, sir.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.125
Detective Rush, Valens.
Philadelphia homicide.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.291
These people are here
to ask you some questions.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.458
Answer them.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.250
Gung-ho jarhead.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.875
We're here about
Nash Cavanaugh.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.333
Gung-ho jarhead number two.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.458
We hear you had a beef
with him in swimming class.

07:05.542 --> 07:06.709
Almost drowned you.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.667
Guy just wanted me to
be all that I could be.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.208
Got you pretty pissed off.

07:10.291 --> 07:11.834
(Scotty)
'Pissed off enough
to wanna kill him?'

07:11.917 --> 07:13.834
That's not how it was.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.500
I just wanted another chance.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.208
I can do it, sir.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.083
One minute, sir.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.041
I can do it. Look.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.625
Go.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.875
Time.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.458
Didn't think you
had it in you, buddy.

08:02.542 --> 08:04.417
You proved me wrong.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.709
And for that,
you get the prize.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.750
(Lilly)
'What was the prize?'

08:12.834 --> 08:14.875
His respect.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.166
Nash was proud of me.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.417
And that was important to you.
Him bein' proud of you?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.750
Only time anyone ever was.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.166
So what changed?

08:23.250 --> 08:25.750
- 'With what?'
- With you.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.667
Nothin'.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.375
Nothin' changed.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.500
My folks, uh, mailed
me one way, parcel post

08:35.583 --> 08:37.792
no return address
to this armpit.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.500
I was always trouble.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.250
Kid's gone to the dark side.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.375
But back in the
day,
it sounds like

08:47.458 --> 08:49.166
he kinda worshipped Nash.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.750
Didn't hate him.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.625
Well, maybe Nash
had other enemies?

08:52.709 --> 08:54.583
Could be.
The guy was a hard ass.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.750
(Will)
'Got a hold of Private
Kasher's medical records.'

08:56.834 --> 08:58.250
Might shine a different light.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.041
Few weeks prior
to Nash's death

09:00.125 --> 09:02.375
multiple visits
to the infirmary.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.125
- Kid was throwin' up drunk.
- "Drunk?"

09:05.208 --> 09:06.500
He was 13 years old.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.291
Half the academy's
students enter the school

09:08.375 --> 09:09.959
with drug and alcohol problems.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.834
The place is on 24/7 lock-down.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.625
No way those kids can get booze.

09:13.709 --> 09:15.458
But an adult could.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.125
And we know who our resident
drinker on campus was.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.417
Nash Cavanaugh.

09:23.166 --> 09:24.500
Where'd you get
the alcohol, Jerry?

09:24.583 --> 09:27.709
Boozehound Nash, he
ever pass on the love?

09:27.792 --> 09:29.417
- What do you mean?
- Where'd you get the booze?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.750
Maybe you were sippin'
a nip from the Nash stash?

09:31.834 --> 09:33.792
That the real reason you
wanted to get in good with
him?

09:33.875 --> 09:35.333
He gave it to me!

09:35.417 --> 09:37.375
I never asked for it!

09:39.458 --> 09:41.083
That was the prize.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.875
Didn't mean
to scare you, buddy.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.500
Yes, sir.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.417
I mean, no, sir.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.500
I'm not scared.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.583
'Course, you're not.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.041
For what you did today.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.041
- Your reward.
- Sir?

10:08.125 --> 10:09.625
You're a man now.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.667
You made me proud,
being a winner out there.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.417
'You passed go.'

10:13.500 --> 10:15.834
Collect your reward.
Drink up.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.291
Ah.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.166
Not just anyone
gets this reward.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.250
I save it for the winners.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.417
For my special boys
like you, Jerry.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.375
Thank you.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.000
I mean it, sir.

10:38.667 --> 10:41.417
Let's keep this our
secret, okay, buddy?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.834
Just you and me.

10:43.917 --> 10:45.875
Sir, yes, sir.

10:45.959 --> 10:47.500
Our secret.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.041
Your secret?

10:51.125 --> 10:54.417
Ignore, reward...secret.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.834
It's the plan.

10:57.917 --> 11:01.875
Nash ignored you in the pool,
rewarded you with the booze

11:01.959 --> 11:04.125
made you keep a secret.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.458
What other secrets
did he make you keep?

11:07.625 --> 11:12.709
Drawing you in...
keeping things quiet. Why?

11:12.792 --> 11:15.917
What kind of secrets
do a 35-year-old man

11:16.000 --> 11:17.875
and a boy have?

11:17.959 --> 11:21.000
It wasn't a murderer's plan,
was it? It was a
pedophile's--

11:21.083 --> 11:23.917
He deserved to die
for what he did to me!

11:24.000 --> 11:25.500
Sit down.

11:26.875 --> 11:29.166
I did it. I killed him.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.333
- You killed him.
- 'Yeah.'

11:35.500 --> 11:38.542
I killed that sick pervert.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.917
- 'By yourself?'
- I did it.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.709
- Did you write the plan?
- Yes!

11:42.792 --> 11:44.959
What did you
do with it?

11:46.375 --> 11:48.875
Answer us. What did
you do with the plan?

11:48.959 --> 11:51.125
Ripped it up.
Threw it away.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.792
That a fact.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.834
If Jerry didn't send us
the plan, then who did?

12:03.917 --> 12:05.000
He confessed to
the murder, Lil.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.208
We got to call the DA.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.583
Nah, I don't buy it, boss.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.041
The kid was an 80-pound

12:09.125 --> 12:10.291
weakling in 1999.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.834
'No way he drowned a 200-pound'

12:11.917 --> 12:14.000
'adult male on his own.'

12:19.959 --> 12:21.208
Won't change his story.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.542
At least now we got motive.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.166
Victim was a pedophile
with a plan.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.500
For waging physiological
warfare on a 13-year-old
boy.

12:27.583 --> 12:28.583
Pedophiles are prolific.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.041
Nash would've
had other victims.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.041
Maybe Jerry
had an accomplice.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.166
Academy's infirmary records.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.083
Colonel gave them up
without a warrant.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.166
Real cooperative guy.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.166
Elisa? What's wrong?

12:41.250 --> 12:42.458
Medical records of 7th graders

12:42.542 --> 12:45.000
in Nash's swim class, 1999

12:45.083 --> 12:46.333
same year as Jerry.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.333
I checked for symptoms
of sexual abuse.

12:48.417 --> 12:49.834
All I came up with was this.

12:49.917 --> 12:51.333
Private R.J. Holden

12:51.417 --> 12:54.166
reported by a night duty
sergeant for bed-wetting.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.125
Started when he was
in Nash's swim class.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.834
Bedwetting at age 13?

12:57.917 --> 13:01.000
Could've been a symptom
of stress, or sexual abuse.

13:01.083 --> 13:04.125
Night duty sergeant who
reported it, James Creighton.

13:04.208 --> 13:07.166
Well, we'll go back to him,
see if he knows about R.J.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.667
I got to...I-I got to go.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.208
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.959
Uh, hey, I'm-I'm sorry, boss.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.834
Just go, Scotty.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.959
(male #3)
'Alpha Company all
present and accounted for!'

13:23.041 --> 13:24.917
How long has Elisa
been out of the hospital?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.166
A month, two.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.542
(male #3)
'The six P's, and don't you'

13:27.625 --> 13:28.542
'ever forget them!'

13:28.625 --> 13:30.792
Prior preparation prevents

13:30.875 --> 13:32.291
'piss poor performance!'

13:32.375 --> 13:33.917
Grandma's slow,
but she's old!

13:34.000 --> 13:35.583
Sergeant Creighton?

13:39.959 --> 13:42.041
Lieutenant Stillman,
Philadelphia
homicide.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.291
- Sir.
- Sergeant.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.166
We're here about
Cadet R.J.
Holden.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.583
The bedwetting report
you filed when he was
13.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.875
Yes, ma'am.
I surely remember that.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.250
Sergeant, what was the nature

13:50.333 --> 13:52.834
of R.J.'s relationship
with Nash Cavanaugh?

13:52.917 --> 13:54.000
Relationship, sir?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.583
Lieutenant Cavanaugh
abused at least

13:55.667 --> 13:58.166
one boy at this
school...sexuall
y.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.375
Did you know about
that, sergeant?

14:01.458 --> 14:02.959
No, ma'am, I did not.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.083
Did you ever talk to R.J.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.542
about the bed-wetting problem?

14:05.625 --> 14:07.792
It's not my duty to talk
about the problem, sir.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.333
Then what was
your duty,
sergeant?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.500
To end it.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.250
Piss the sheets

14:13.333 --> 14:15.291
you walk the yard, private.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.083
Don't you go all
crybaby on me now.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.917
Do I look like
your mama, private?

14:21.208 --> 14:22.750
He grabbed me.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.041
- What?
- He grabbed me.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.291
What are you
talking about?

14:30.125 --> 14:31.834
Lieutenant Cavanaugh..

14:34.166 --> 14:35.750
...he grabbed my..

14:37.083 --> 14:39.166
...my thing.

14:40.709 --> 14:42.959
- Are you a faggot?
- Sir?

14:43.041 --> 14:45.291
- Are you a faggot?
- No, sir.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.375
I asked you
a direct question

14:46.458 --> 14:47.750
I expect a direct
answer, private!

14:47.834 --> 14:50.041
Are you or are
you not a faggot?

14:51.375 --> 14:53.458
I am not a faggot, sir.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.417
So we don't have
a problem then

14:55.500 --> 14:57.041
do we, Private Holden?

14:58.250 --> 14:59.792
No, sir.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.125
Disciplining
the plebes was my
job.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.792
I did what I thought was best.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.333
Disciplining them?

15:07.417 --> 15:10.208
Sergeant, R.J. was a
13-year-old
boy asking for help.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.834
Is that the approach that
earned you the bronze star?

15:17.166 --> 15:18.542
These boys are liars

15:18.625 --> 15:20.333
'cheats and drunks.'

15:20.417 --> 15:21.667
Slop, sir.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.959
Just like I was when
I came here as a boy.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.291
The bronze star, sir?

15:26.375 --> 15:28.375
The academy earned that.

15:28.458 --> 15:29.959
Made me a man.

15:30.041 --> 15:34.125
What Nash did to R.J., did
that make him a man,
sergeant?

15:37.125 --> 15:38.417
(Scotty)
'Elisa?'

15:48.375 --> 15:49.709
Elisa?

15:52.583 --> 15:53.875
'El?'

16:07.417 --> 16:08.583
Can't say I remember
that conversation

16:08.667 --> 16:10.875
with Sergeant Creighton.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.375
Sorry, ma'am.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.291
You told him that Lieutenant
Cavanaugh touched you, R.J.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.709
Like I said, don't
recall the convo.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.667
What about the bed-wetting?

16:19.750 --> 16:20.792
You recall that, R.J.?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.959
Now that would be memorable.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.041
Can't say I do, ma'am.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.875
Your file's got the records--

16:26.959 --> 16:28.750
Then someone made a mistake.

16:28.834 --> 16:31.333
- I don't think so.
- So blondes think now, ma'am?

16:31.417 --> 16:33.542
Watch your tone, son.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.917
Best defense is a good
offense, right, R.J.?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.041
(R.J.)
'Whatever, ma'am.'

16:38.125 --> 16:40.709
Take the focus off of you.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.875
What Nash did to you.

16:42.959 --> 16:45.792
R.J., we know about Jerry.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.125
Jerry?

16:48.125 --> 16:50.208
And what Nash did to him.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.750
- 'From this.'
- "Ignore, reward, secret."

16:56.834 --> 16:59.500
What can you tell
us
about number four?

16:59.583 --> 17:02.125
"Test." How'd he test you?

17:05.333 --> 17:07.583
You were 13 years old, R.J.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.875
What Nash Cavanaugh
did to you was wrong.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.917
I'll tell..

17:16.000 --> 17:17.959
...you.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.417
Alright.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.041
Sit down, son.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.166
I'm not a fag.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.917
It's alright, R.J.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.125
I'm not a fag.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.291
<i>(Nash)</i>
<i>Got to make sure you get in</i>

17:39.375 --> 17:40.625
'some extra hours of practice.'

17:40.709 --> 17:41.792
(R.J.)
'Yes, sir.'

17:41.875 --> 17:42.917
'Meet's coming up in a week.'

17:43.000 --> 17:43.959
And you are going to make

17:44.041 --> 17:45.959
the top ten this time, buddy.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.417
But we have got
to keep this on the
DL.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.291
We don't want anyone to
think
I'm playing favorites here.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.500
Sure. I mean, yes, sir.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.458
Just like the beer

17:57.542 --> 17:59.917
this is our secret.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.083
Just you and me.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.959
You haven't told anyone
about that, have you?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.208
No, sir.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.542
Of course, you haven't.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.291
Or I would've heard.

18:13.291 --> 18:14.834
'You passed the test.'

18:14.917 --> 18:17.166
'Keeping our secrets.'

18:17.250 --> 18:19.500
'You got an A-plus, buddy.'

18:27.917 --> 18:30.667
You didn't think I was
gonna hurt you, did you?

18:30.750 --> 18:33.250
Of course, you didn't.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.583
Now give me a big smile.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.959
Number four..."test."

18:46.083 --> 18:47.792
Make sure they don't run..

18:49.709 --> 18:50.875
...and I didn't.

18:50.959 --> 18:53.083
Tell me about number five.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.166
"Escalate."

18:56.250 --> 18:58.959
He'd show me porn magazines.

18:59.041 --> 19:02.667
Tell me, "you can touch
yourself if you want.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.041
I won't tell."

19:07.083 --> 19:09.166
He used them on other boys too.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.250
That's how me and..

19:11.333 --> 19:13.000
You and Jerry?

19:15.625 --> 19:17.583
- I don't know any Jerry.
- 'Jerry Kasher.'

19:17.667 --> 19:18.792
I don't know any Jerry.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.083
'You were in
the same swim class.'

19:20.166 --> 19:21.125
It was me, okay?

19:21.208 --> 19:22.250
I drowned that son of a bitch!

19:22.333 --> 19:23.959
I killed Nash!

19:28.834 --> 19:30.959
And I don't know any Jerry.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.750
R.J. says he doesn't know Jerry.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.542
Jerry says he doesn't know R.J.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.542
But both are confessing
to the murder.

19:38.625 --> 19:42.542
And neither of them seem to
know this plan was sent to us.

19:42.625 --> 19:43.959
A school that size, boss

19:44.041 --> 19:46.041
these kids had
to know each
other.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.000
Well old enough to
talk about sexual abuse?

19:48.083 --> 19:49.667
Kids came from
different worlds, Lil.

19:49.750 --> 19:53.083
Popular athlete, loser
outcast.
Nothing in common.

19:53.166 --> 19:57.083
- 'Except Nash's swim class.'
- Hey, handwriting's back.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.125
Neither Jerry or R.J.'s
matched the plan.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.875
So there was
a boy number three?

20:01.959 --> 20:03.208
Nash being Nash

20:03.291 --> 20:04.917
no telling how many
boys wanted him dead.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.250
Well, maybe this
third kid holds the key

20:06.333 --> 20:09.458
how Jerry and R.J.
are connected.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.917
I'll lean on Jerry
again. Short fuse.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.291
Guess who I just
had a chat with?

20:26.500 --> 20:29.000
'Private R.J. Holden.'

20:29.083 --> 20:30.834
'He told.'

20:30.917 --> 20:32.834
What are you talking about?

20:32.917 --> 20:35.125
Number five.

20:35.208 --> 20:36.500
"Escalate."

20:38.083 --> 20:39.417
The magazines Nash used.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.458
No wonder you wanted
to kill him. I would too.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.166
- R.J. told you about that?
- Mm-hmm.

20:45.250 --> 20:48.375
And that you, Jerry,
were the ringleader.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.041
'He said you thought up
the murder all on your own--'

20:50.125 --> 20:52.166
It was Dominic's
idea, not mine!

20:52.250 --> 20:54.166
It was all Dominic!

20:56.417 --> 20:57.917
Sit down.

20:59.417 --> 21:00.917
Sit down.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.834
So Dominic wrote the plan, huh?

21:07.917 --> 21:10.125
'How'd you guys
find each other?'

21:14.250 --> 21:16.208
'You were just kids, you know.'

21:16.291 --> 21:17.500
'What happened..'

21:22.250 --> 21:24.375
...it wasn't your fault.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.041
He..

21:28.083 --> 21:30.208
...started with the drinks.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.875
That was our secret.

21:34.959 --> 21:37.333
'Then came the night swims.'

21:38.333 --> 21:40.375
'Then the magazines and..'

21:41.166 --> 21:42.750
...other things.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.667
And by that time I'd
kept so many secrets

21:49.750 --> 21:51.750
I couldn't tell the truth.

21:51.834 --> 21:53.917
Then tell the truth now.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.250
Dominic..

22:01.166 --> 22:03.000
...was the only one
of us who had guts.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.917
How did Dominic
find you and R.J.?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.500
I..

22:08.625 --> 22:11.250
...took one of
Nash's magazines..

22:12.917 --> 22:14.458
'...and showed it around.'

22:14.542 --> 22:17.208
And you know, I didn't...
mean anything by it.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.750
I just..

22:20.250 --> 22:22.417
I wanted the other
kids to like me.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.250
Her boobs are huge!

22:31.333 --> 22:33.542
'Like balloons.'

22:33.625 --> 22:34.959
I love boobs.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.333
Yo, I didn't see Miss April yet!

22:57.417 --> 22:59.458
'You're rippin' her booty, man.'

22:59.542 --> 23:01.625
(male #4)
'What the hell?'

23:07.041 --> 23:10.041
That's when we knew.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.125
And that's when
you made the plan.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.750
To do to Nash..

23:15.834 --> 23:18.959
...what he did to us.

23:19.041 --> 23:22.083
'"Ignore. Reward.'

23:22.917 --> 23:24.709
'"Secret.'

23:24.792 --> 23:26.792
'"Test.'

23:26.875 --> 23:28.583
"Escalate.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.458
Destroy."

23:40.500 --> 23:41.875
(Lilly)
'Dominic LaSalle.'

23:41.959 --> 23:44.667
'Also in Nash's swim class.'

23:44.750 --> 23:46.041
(John)
'Lil, you take
him in Interview A.'

23:46.125 --> 23:48.834
'You two split up
Jerry and R.J.'

23:48.917 --> 23:51.667
I'm here as Dominic's guardian.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.500
I'd like to observe.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.959
John, show the colonel
to observation, please.

24:09.792 --> 24:12.417
Not exactly chomping at
the bit to take down another
kid

24:12.500 --> 24:14.542
especially when
the guy deserved to die.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.083
- Amen.
- We got our jobs to do.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.875
Let's go.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.208
Wish I had called in sick today.

24:25.709 --> 24:27.041
Yeah, me too.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.166
Scotty, is she okay?

24:32.250 --> 24:35.041
Uh, she's...gone.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.959
- What?
- She-she's not anywhere.

24:37.041 --> 24:39.166
Not any of the places
she goes to when she
gets

24:39.250 --> 24:41.834
you know, like this, the
library, the park, her
sister's.

24:41.917 --> 24:43.500
All day, I'm
driving.
I can't find her.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.208
Scotty, call it in,
get some help.

24:45.291 --> 24:46.959
I can't call it in.
They'll make her go
back.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.083
And I promised her
she'd-she'd
never have to go back.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.542
- I promised. I..
- Okay.

24:50.625 --> 24:52.500
I can't do that to her.

24:52.583 --> 24:53.542
Alright. It's going
to be alright.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.083
Playing stickball on my block.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.208
That's the first
time I seen her.

24:58.291 --> 25:00.500
Fourteen years old.

25:00.583 --> 25:04.125
Oh, man...just kickin'
it on a hot summer
night.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.083
Whew!

25:08.166 --> 25:09.125
That's the only place Elisa

25:09.208 --> 25:11.792
ever felt...normal, you know?

25:13.333 --> 25:15.375
I gotta find her.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.750
Are you sure you
want my handwriting?

25:28.834 --> 25:30.417
Hmm?

25:30.500 --> 25:33.458
[chuckles]
Don't you want to
play bad cop
first?

25:33.542 --> 25:35.834
'Knock me around some?'

25:35.917 --> 25:37.417
Write.

25:41.417 --> 25:43.917
I confess.
I wrote the
plan.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.291
And you sent it to us.

25:46.375 --> 25:49.083
- Why?
- Boredom.

25:49.166 --> 25:52.709
Military environments thrive
on the cultivation of it.

25:52.792 --> 25:56.208
[chuckles]
Makes warfare that
much more of a rush.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.625
- Really?
- You should know.

26:00.709 --> 26:03.834
Dreary police academy drills.

26:03.917 --> 26:06.250
Then you get to kill.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.709
What a thrill.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.000
I wouldn't know.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.875
Maybe you will.

26:11.959 --> 26:13.959
Like you do?

26:14.041 --> 26:16.083
We killed that pervert.

26:17.041 --> 26:18.959
- "We?"
- Me and my two buddies.

26:19.041 --> 26:21.917
What "two buddies," Dominic?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.625
Me, myself and I.

26:23.709 --> 26:26.709
(Will)
Your friends are
putting the job on you.

26:26.792 --> 26:28.583
Jerry, Dominic.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.959
You want a deal,
you better jump in
fast.

26:31.041 --> 26:33.166
Your wife still
flog the bishop?

26:34.458 --> 26:37.667
Or did she stop doing
that a hundred years ago?

26:37.750 --> 26:40.041
My wife's dead.

26:40.125 --> 26:42.500
Nine years ago.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.625
Tell me about the plan.

26:47.583 --> 26:49.667
Dominic figured it out.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.750
What Nash was doing.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.166
His plan.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.166
(Dominic)
What he did to you
at the pool, Jerry

26:58.250 --> 26:59.834
he did that to all of us.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.458
'It's like his plan all along.'

27:02.542 --> 27:04.000
I don't get it.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.625
Number one, "ignore."

27:06.709 --> 27:08.333
He ignored us in different ways

27:08.417 --> 27:10.834
made us beg for attention.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.834
- Then he rewarded us.
- With the beer.

27:12.917 --> 27:14.291
That was number two in his plan.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.667
- He made me keep it a secret.
- Me too.

27:16.750 --> 27:20.125
'Cause it was number
three, keeping secrets.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.709
Then he made real sure

27:22.792 --> 27:24.542
we never told on him.

27:24.625 --> 27:27.375
- I didn't. Did you?
- No.

27:27.458 --> 27:28.500
Shh.

27:29.542 --> 27:31.041
(Jerry)
Kinda like a test.

27:31.125 --> 27:34.041
Right. Number four, "test."

27:34.125 --> 27:35.250
Right.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.250
'Made sure we never told anyone'

27:37.333 --> 27:39.917
'so he could do other
things and not get caught.'

27:40.000 --> 27:41.792
Like show us those magazines.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.625
(Dominic)
That was number
five. "Escalate."

27:44.709 --> 27:46.542
What does that escalate mean?

27:46.625 --> 27:49.166
To make things worse.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.208
Then, the final thing.
Number six.

27:52.291 --> 27:55.375
We know what that is.
You don't have to say it.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.750
Number one, ignore.

28:04.834 --> 28:07.542
No one show up at
swim class tomorrow.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.041
We do to him..

28:10.125 --> 28:13.417
...step...by step

28:13.500 --> 28:15.458
exactly what he did to us.

28:16.625 --> 28:19.542
So after you skipped out
on Nash's swim class

28:19.625 --> 28:21.083
what happened?

28:21.166 --> 28:22.458
Number two.

28:24.417 --> 28:26.875
Whoever he came to first.

28:26.959 --> 28:29.500
Whoever he picked.

28:29.583 --> 28:32.375
That kid would be
the bait, the reward.

28:34.250 --> 28:37.542
I was just holding my breath.

28:38.458 --> 28:40.333
Hoping it wouldn't be me.

28:42.834 --> 28:45.500
(Nash)
'Private LaSalle,
why were you not in class?'

28:45.583 --> 28:47.208
(Dominic)
'I got busy.'

28:47.291 --> 28:48.750
(Nash)
'Excuse me?'

28:48.834 --> 28:51.625
I said...I got busy.

28:51.709 --> 28:54.333
Wanna see what I
got so busy with?

28:56.291 --> 28:58.667
Got it for tonight.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.625
For the pool.

29:00.709 --> 29:03.542
Will you bring some beer...sir?

29:04.750 --> 29:06.375
Number two.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.500
"Reward."

29:10.583 --> 29:13.792
You were it.

29:13.875 --> 29:16.000
R.J. and Jerry are talking.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.792
Time's a-wastin'.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.000
You're playing your hand
badly, Detective Rush.

29:22.083 --> 29:25.125
[chuckles]
See, in poker..

29:26.542 --> 29:29.166
...like business or warfare..

29:31.291 --> 29:34.250
...the optimal strategy
is not to have one.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.834
'Or, rather, not to show it.'

29:36.917 --> 29:39.709
You wear yours
like a bad dye job.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.667
Game's over, Dominic.

29:47.041 --> 29:48.959
You already confessed
to the murder.

29:49.041 --> 29:51.417
So there's something
that happened that night..

29:51.500 --> 29:54.375
...that you don't wanna give up.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.375
I wonder what that is.

29:58.834 --> 30:00.959
Number three, "secret."

30:02.834 --> 30:04.125
What was the secret?

30:04.208 --> 30:06.709
Dominic was gonna
get Nash in the pool..

30:08.125 --> 30:10.250
...like he did to us.

30:11.125 --> 30:13.333
Promise to do..

30:14.500 --> 30:16.583
...things with him.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.458
And then..

30:19.542 --> 30:21.667
...and then
everything went wrong.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.458
(Dominic)
'Ready to get in?'

30:26.542 --> 30:29.875
Nah. I'm a little
too tired, buddy.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.417
Maybe some other time.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.417
But..

30:37.500 --> 30:38.792
...but I got a secret.

30:40.083 --> 30:45.000
A real good secret...
for us...in the pool.

30:45.083 --> 30:47.500
Like I said...
maybe some other time.

30:50.667 --> 30:52.583
So the plan fell apart.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.834
Nash left.

30:54.917 --> 30:57.959
No. He didn't.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.500
You got him
back in the
pool?

31:05.709 --> 31:07.792
'How'd you do that?'

31:09.166 --> 31:10.792
'How'd you do that, R.J.?'

31:10.875 --> 31:13.542
How did you get Nash
into the pool, Jerry?

31:14.625 --> 31:16.333
'How'd you do it?'

31:30.750 --> 31:32.125
<i>(Lilly)</i>
<i>Dominic..</i>

31:33.709 --> 31:35.875
...whatever you had to do..

31:37.750 --> 31:40.041
...it wasn't your fault.

31:40.125 --> 31:42.417
- 'What you did..'
- Number four.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.792
"Test."

31:46.875 --> 31:48.625
Make sure that he doesn't run.

31:48.709 --> 31:50.834
But I couldn't
let the plan fail.

31:50.917 --> 31:52.959
So I begged him.

31:54.375 --> 31:57.291
"Please," I said.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.750
"Please."

32:00.917 --> 32:03.041
Like I said, some other time.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.375
Please?

32:11.583 --> 32:12.875
Please?

32:19.750 --> 32:21.792
Only if you smile.

32:31.792 --> 32:35.375
(Lilly)
Number six. "Destroy."

32:35.458 --> 32:38.125
"From the child,
comes forth the soldier."

32:41.000 --> 32:43.417
That's what he would
say when he was done.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.333
And I would just
go away in my mind.

32:53.166 --> 32:56.709
Not this time. Not this time.

33:00.458 --> 33:03.083
(Nash)
'"From the child,
comes forth the soldier."'

33:05.625 --> 33:07.375
(Nash)
'Isn't that right, buddy?'

33:12.959 --> 33:14.625
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

33:14.709 --> 33:17.041
(Jerry)
Don't let your elbows
touch the water, private.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.875
Sixty seconds! Go!

33:18.959 --> 33:21.166
(R.J.)
'Can't is not in
your vocabulary, cadet.'

33:21.250 --> 33:24.083
- Failure is not an option!
- You're special!

33:24.166 --> 33:27.166
A real winner! My special boy!

33:27.250 --> 33:28.917
You like this, don't you?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.750
Don't pretend
you don't like it!

33:30.834 --> 33:33.583
Destroy, destroy, destroy!

33:39.875 --> 33:41.458
Somebody's coming.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.083
They shouldn't go away for this.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.583
(John)
'Hmm, they confessed
to murder one.'

33:53.667 --> 33:55.083
'What are you gonna do?'

33:55.166 --> 33:58.375
Maybe the guy slipped, fell
and hit his head, boss.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.834
- I could see that.
- Accidental death.

34:00.917 --> 34:03.583
(Lilly)
'My pen ran out in there,
didn't get that last part.'

34:03.667 --> 34:06.083
(John)
'I think we could all use
a scotch right about now.'

34:06.166 --> 34:08.417
- 'Anyone hear from Scotty?'
- 'Not me.'

34:08.500 --> 34:10.083
(Jerry)
'You sent it in,
you friggin' rat!'

34:10.166 --> 34:13.500
- Hey, hey, hey, knock if
off!
- 'You friggin' liar!'

34:15.834 --> 34:17.083
Gun!

34:18.250 --> 34:20.000
- Don't shoot.
- Don't you touch me!

34:20.083 --> 34:21.750
- 'Dominic.'
- 'Alright put it down,
son.'

34:21.834 --> 34:23.083
(Lilly)
'Dominic, listen to me.'

34:23.166 --> 34:24.625
- 'Don't shoot.'
- 'Dominic.'

34:24.709 --> 34:27.125
- Dominic, put the gun down.
- Don't nobody touch me!

34:27.208 --> 34:28.959
(Lilly)
Listen to me.

34:29.041 --> 34:30.667
'Dominic, listen to me.'

34:31.792 --> 34:34.959
It's gonna be okay,
I promise you.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.166
I promise you, Dominic.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.834
'It's going to be okay.'

34:40.250 --> 34:42.750
- Put the gun down.
- Listen, I wrote it.

34:43.959 --> 34:46.291
I

34:49.625 --> 34:51.166
But I didn't send it.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.834
Put the gun down.

34:52.917 --> 34:54.417
(Lilly)
'Dominic!'

34:56.250 --> 34:57.667
I didn't send it.

34:57.750 --> 35:00.166
(Lilly)
'No, Dominic!'

35:01.333 --> 35:02.375
No!

35:08.166 --> 35:11.291
I talked to the hospital.
It's looking bad.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.583
They can't say
for sure right now.

35:15.375 --> 35:18.583
If Dominic didn't
send the plan..

35:18.667 --> 35:20.333
...then who did?

35:20.417 --> 35:22.875
It's over, Lil. Let's go home.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.917
(Scotty)
I've been looking
for you all day.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.250
Everywhere I'm looking
for you. God, Elisa.

35:48.333 --> 35:50.959
- I'm sorry.
- You okay?

35:52.458 --> 35:55.750
- Hey. Talk to me.
- They came back, Scotty.

35:57.458 --> 35:58.709
The giants.

35:58.792 --> 36:00.125
I know what you're
thinking, I know you think

36:00.208 --> 36:02.458
that I didn't take
my meds, but I did.

36:04.709 --> 36:05.709
And they still came back.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.041
Well, we'll get stronger meds.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.250
We'll talk to the doctor,
see what he has to say--

36:08.333 --> 36:09.834
That's what we did last time.

36:09.917 --> 36:13.166
'That's what we do all the
time
and it doesn't get better.'

36:14.333 --> 36:16.291
Maybe it just doesn't.

36:26.542 --> 36:28.375
I'm gonna go stay at
my sister's for a while.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.959
If that's what you
want to do, do it.

36:30.041 --> 36:32.583
I don't know what
else to do. Do you?

36:37.166 --> 36:39.750
Shirts two,
skins zero.

36:41.709 --> 36:43.250
There ain't no skins.

36:43.333 --> 36:45.250
I mean, don't you see that?
<i>look!</i>

36:45.333 --> 36:48.125
I meant before
when we were kids.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.291
Let's go, Elisa.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.333
Skins make a comeback

36:50.417 --> 36:51.917
in the last inning.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.709
- Do you remember?
- No.

36:54.792 --> 36:55.917
'Triple play.'

36:56.000 --> 36:58.417
'Scored by Scotty Valens.'

37:08.333 --> 37:10.000
I don't remember.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.333
I do.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.291
- That was a long time ago.
- Not so long ago, Scotty.

37:20.583 --> 37:22.959
'Not so long ago.'

37:34.083 --> 37:36.458
Dominic's in the ICU.

37:36.542 --> 37:38.083
No word yet.

37:38.166 --> 37:42.083
Last thing he said before
he shot himself was..

37:42.166 --> 37:45.583
...he didn't send
the plan. Then who did?

37:45.667 --> 37:47.875
Was there someone else in on
this besides the three of you?

37:47.959 --> 37:50.208
- No, just us.
- But someone else knew.

37:50.291 --> 37:52.583
We lost it that night.

37:52.667 --> 37:53.667
The plan?

37:53.750 --> 37:54.959
It was in
Dominic's
pocket.

37:55.041 --> 37:56.667
He stuck everything
in his pockets.

37:56.750 --> 37:57.834
Dumbass.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.208
(R.J.)
And then it was gone after..

38:03.792 --> 38:05.834
...the pool.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.250
'It was gone.'

38:15.333 --> 38:16.709
Where'd it go?

38:16.792 --> 38:18.625
- What?
- The plan. It was here.

38:18.709 --> 38:20.542
You put in your pocket?

38:20.625 --> 38:22.792
- You dumbass!
- Shh!

38:24.166 --> 38:26.625
Okay, it's okay.

38:26.709 --> 38:29.125
Listen up, here's what we do.

38:29.208 --> 38:33.333
Never tell.
No matter what happens.

38:33.417 --> 38:36.625
If we're ever caught,
each man takes the fall.

38:36.709 --> 38:39.542
By himself. Alone.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.750
Like a soldier.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.917
- Never tell.
- Never tell.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.750
Never tell.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.417
He went back to
the pool that night

38:57.500 --> 38:59.375
Dominic, to look for it.

38:59.458 --> 39:00.417
Did he find it?

39:00.500 --> 39:02.667
We never talked about it.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.250
Like it never happened.

39:06.625 --> 39:09.208
And after a while,
it felt like it never did.

39:31.834 --> 39:33.917
He should have this.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.750
Not me.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.959
'For what he did, they all did.'

39:39.041 --> 39:41.375
Took more guts than I ever had.

39:44.458 --> 39:47.333
"From the child,
comes forth the soldier."

39:48.458 --> 39:50.709
That's what Nash always said.

39:52.709 --> 39:54.041
After.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.250
You were a lifer at the academy.

40:03.709 --> 40:06.500
In Nash's swim class, long ago.

40:06.583 --> 40:09.125
Not so long ago.

40:09.208 --> 40:12.375
You were the duty
sergeant that night.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.250
You found Nash's body.

40:17.959 --> 40:19.291
And the plan.

40:19.375 --> 40:25.500
The world had to know
what he did to them. To me.

40:25.583 --> 40:28.500
That's why you sent it in.
But why now, Creighton?

40:29.834 --> 40:31.667
It's the last class
of Nash's victims.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.000
The last to bear witness.

40:33.083 --> 40:35.291
Nash's secret would
go away with them.

40:38.750 --> 40:41.333
- You couldn't let that
happen.
- I didn't let that happen.

40:41.417 --> 40:44.041
No...you didn't.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.083
Why are you here?

40:52.542 --> 40:54.959
You let these boys go,
I'll tell you.

40:55.041 --> 40:56.875
Depends on what
you have to tell me.

40:58.583 --> 41:01.959
I watch..

41:02.041 --> 41:04.041
...boys.

41:04.125 --> 41:06.417
Just like Nash did, I watch boys

41:06.500 --> 41:09.375
and I know..

41:09.458 --> 41:11.542
...that I'm becoming him.

41:12.458 --> 41:15.208
Please put me away.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.125
Stop me and let them
have their lives.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.000
Let them become...men.

41:22.166 --> 41:25.417
- Just let them go.
- How can I?

41:26.625 --> 41:29.667
- They killed a man.
- No, they didn't.

41:33.709 --> 41:35.417
(Dominic)
'Somebody's coming.'

41:43.417 --> 41:45.667
Creighton!

41:45.750 --> 41:47.417
Creighton.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.542
Creigh..

41:49.542 --> 41:51.375
Creigh. Creigh. Creigh.

42:03.417 --> 42:05.917
Creigh. Creigh. Creigh.
