WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.295
Hey.

00:03.337 --> 00:04.463
What are we watching?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.047
A documentary

00:04.505 --> 00:06.047
on eye surgery.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.466
They're reattaching

00:06.089 --> 00:07.466
a retina.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.050
MAN:

00:07.508 --> 00:09.050
The procedure involves

00:09.092 --> 00:11.512
making small incisions

00:09.092 --> 00:11.512
into the wall of the eye

00:11.553 --> 00:13.054
to allow the introduction

00:11.553 --> 00:13.054
of instruments

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
(drill whirring)

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
into the vitreous cavity.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.433
Is there

00:15.098 --> 00:16.433
anything else on?

00:16.475 --> 00:17.935
Dad, this is

00:16.475 --> 00:17.935
interesting.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.353
I might be a

00:17.977 --> 00:19.353
doctor someday.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.896
You're right,

00:19.394 --> 00:20.896
you're right.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.231
The draining of the vitreous,

00:20.938 --> 00:23.231
the clear, gel-like fluid

00:23.273 --> 00:25.066
that fills

00:23.273 --> 00:25.066
the back of the eye...

00:25.108 --> 00:27.945
Ah! Uh, I'm going

00:25.108 --> 00:27.945
to go read.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.659
WOMAN:

00:30.739 --> 00:33.659
Kiki beats the heat

00:30.739 --> 00:33.659
in a red chiffon teddy.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.076
You don't want to watch

00:33.701 --> 00:35.076
a lingerie calendar shoot

00:35.118 --> 00:36.286
with your dad.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
I want you out of this house

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
in 30 seconds.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.951
Let's show some hustle.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.411
We've got time.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.205
When we're really late, our

01:17.452 --> 01:20.205
lunches are on the front lawn.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.127
Mom, Reese...

01:26.169 --> 01:27.838
Go, go, go, go!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.838
(grunts)

01:27.880 --> 01:30.131
Okay, I'm doing dry

01:27.880 --> 01:30.131
cleaner, mechanic

01:30.173 --> 01:31.132
and post office.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.593
You're doing groceries and DMV,

01:31.174 --> 01:32.593
right?

01:32.634 --> 01:33.761
Right.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.761
You got the cable bill?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.429
Great. Bye, guy.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.645
Did I just say

01:41.184 --> 01:43.645
"Bye, guy" to you?

01:43.687 --> 01:45.022
I'm pretty sure you did.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.815
"Guy?" I-I-I called you "guy"?!

01:46.857 --> 01:48.067
How can that happen?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.651
I've never done that before.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.612
Hal, it's a lapse; it

01:49.693 --> 01:51.612
doesn't mean anything.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.321
"Guy"?!

01:51.653 --> 01:53.321
Hal, it happens.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.156
Let's get one thing clear.

01:55.198 --> 01:59.160
In no way, shape, or form

01:55.198 --> 01:59.160
do I think of you as a guy.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.203
You are a gorgeous,

02:00.245 --> 02:02.163
exciting, feminine goddess

02:02.205 --> 02:06.167
that I still don't know

02:02.205 --> 02:06.167
what I've done to deserve.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.878
Do you understand that?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.838
Yes.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.052
Let's do this walking.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.388
Okay, just for

02:16.386 --> 02:18.388
argument's sake,

02:18.430 --> 02:21.850
let's say Dr. Bombay was

02:18.430 --> 02:21.850
one of the MASH surgeons.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.184
I'd still want

02:21.892 --> 02:23.184
Hawkeye operating

02:23.226 --> 02:25.646
on my perforated aorta.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.648
It's experience

02:25.687 --> 02:27.648
that counts.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.441
Think about it.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.152
(thunder crashing)

02:34.488 --> 02:36.824
Will you hurry up

02:34.488 --> 02:36.824
with those dishes?--

02:34.488 --> 02:36.824
my bubbles are evaporating.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.826
Eric, you're not

02:36.865 --> 02:38.826
going to believe this.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.203
I swear I just saw

02:38.867 --> 02:42.203
Commandant Spangler

02:42.245 --> 02:43.580
standing outside

02:42.245 --> 02:43.580
the window.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.206
That's not even funny,

02:43.622 --> 02:45.206
Francis.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.459
There are some things

02:45.248 --> 02:47.459
you just don't joke about,

02:47.501 --> 02:50.253
and that hook-handed maniac

02:47.501 --> 02:50.253
is at the top of the list.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.212
But he was so real.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.007
It was like being back

02:51.254 --> 02:53.007
at military school.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.341
I know.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.051
For a long time, I saw him

02:54.382 --> 02:56.051
every time I shut my eyes.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.386
You just have to remember

02:56.093 --> 02:58.386
we escaped

02:58.428 --> 02:59.429
from that hellhole.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.514
We made it out

03:00.555 --> 03:02.141
and found better lives

03:00.555 --> 03:02.141
for ourselves.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.142
Now, let's get

03:03.182 --> 03:04.225
these dishes done.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.602
We still have

03:04.267 --> 03:05.602
to snake out the toilets

03:05.644 --> 03:07.104
before we can

03:05.644 --> 03:07.104
call it a night.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.649
(thunder crashing)

03:12.275 --> 03:14.235
Hey, guys, wait up!

03:14.277 --> 03:16.113
(panting)

03:16.905 --> 03:19.198
(clattering)

03:20.450 --> 03:22.243
Hi.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.705
I'm Dewey.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.247
You smell terrible.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.749
I like you.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.961
Maybe you could

03:28.876 --> 03:30.961
come home with me.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.296
Dewey, you're not allowed

03:31.003 --> 03:33.296
to have a dog, remember?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.256
We want you

03:33.338 --> 03:35.256
to be miserable.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
That's right, son,

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
it's our job to make sure

03:37.300 --> 03:39.553
we're as unfair

03:37.300 --> 03:39.553
as possible to you.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.304
Don't listen

03:39.594 --> 03:41.304
to them, Dewey.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.098
I've studied the

03:41.346 --> 03:43.098
matter thoroughly,

03:43.140 --> 03:45.350
and I'm convinced you

03:43.140 --> 03:45.350
can get away with it.

03:45.392 --> 03:49.270
All you have to do

03:45.392 --> 03:49.270
is hide me. Hmm.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.775
I'll call you Marshmallow.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.946

Well, you're off work

04:21.595 --> 04:23.304
in five minutes,

04:23.346 --> 04:25.724
and I am here to whisk you away

04:23.346 --> 04:25.724
for a night of romance.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.309
Oh, honey, that's so sweet,

04:25.766 --> 04:28.309
but I can't.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.938
I've got to cover

04:28.351 --> 04:30.938
for Craig tonight.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.355
Why?!

04:32.397 --> 04:33.732
Oh, he's sick as a dog.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.317
Come on! You know that guy's

04:33.774 --> 04:36.317
the biggest faker in the world.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.319
The last time

04:36.359 --> 04:38.319
he was out with the flu,

04:38.361 --> 04:42.116
we saw him jumping up and down

04:38.361 --> 04:42.116
in the window on  The Today Show.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.325
That doesn't mean

04:42.157 --> 04:44.325
I wasn't sick.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.327
You didn't happen to tape that,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.327
did you?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.955
I set my timer wrong.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.330
Oh, honey,

04:49.372 --> 04:50.540
I'm so sorry.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.210
After all the trouble

04:50.582 --> 04:53.210
you went through.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.795
No. It's no big deal.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.422
Really, it wasn't any trouble.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.968
Thanks again

04:59.382 --> 05:00.968
for the ride home.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.343
Wow.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.429
So, this is

05:02.385 --> 05:04.429
what it would have been like

05:04.471 --> 05:05.806
to go to my prom.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.349
All I wanted was

05:05.847 --> 05:08.349
a nice evening with my wife.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.350
I even dug up

05:09.392 --> 05:10.644
the wedding vows

05:10.685 --> 05:13.272
I never was able

05:10.685 --> 05:13.272
to read to her.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.355
What happened?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
Oh, she went into labor

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
with Francis

05:16.399 --> 05:17.985
in the middle of the ceremony.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.155
I was going to read

05:18.026 --> 05:21.155
them to her tonight.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.532
God... now I feel awful.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.160
Don't worry

05:24.574 --> 05:26.160
about it, Craig.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.162
It's not your fault.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.371
No, I really feel awful.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.749

05:53.228 --> 05:54.604
Are you awake?

05:54.646 --> 05:56.023
(Marshmallow whining)

05:56.064 --> 05:58.566
Oh, honey,

05:56.064 --> 05:58.566
I'm so sorry about tonight.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.652
Listen, tomorrow night,

05:58.608 --> 06:00.652
I'm going to fix us

06:00.694 --> 06:02.403
such a special dinner--

06:00.694 --> 06:02.403
just the two of us.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.613
We'll lock the boys

06:02.445 --> 06:03.613
in the garage,

06:03.655 --> 06:05.406
open a bottle of wine--

06:03.655 --> 06:05.406
it'll be great.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.701
(Marshmallow whining)

06:07.742 --> 06:11.370
Oh, I know, honey, I know.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.458
That's all I have.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.669
(whining)

06:23.050 --> 06:25.177
(sighing)

06:44.403 --> 06:45.530
Is the roast

06:44.403 --> 06:45.530
medium rare?

06:45.572 --> 06:46.907
Did you put the

06:45.572 --> 06:46.907
wine in the fridge?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.533
Mom, my roast

06:46.948 --> 06:48.533
is perfect.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.451
I never even knew

06:48.575 --> 06:50.451
we had fancy silverware.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.453
When was the last time

06:50.493 --> 06:52.453
you used this?

06:52.495 --> 06:53.621
The night you were conceived.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.748
You want more details?

06:54.789 --> 06:55.749
No.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.749
Good.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.709
Thank you so much

06:55.790 --> 06:57.709
for your help!

06:57.751 --> 06:59.753
Now, get in your room,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.753
and don't make a peep

06:59.794 --> 07:00.921
for the next

06:59.794 --> 07:00.921
five hours.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.421
Move!

07:05.008 --> 07:07.468
(Marshmallow whining,

07:05.008 --> 07:07.468

07:07.510 --> 07:08.678
He's not a dog.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.264
He's just pretend.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.140
What's for dinner?

07:10.305 --> 07:12.140
(door closes)

07:12.182 --> 07:14.559
A dog? Busted!

07:14.601 --> 07:16.561
Please don't tell Mom! Please!

07:16.603 --> 07:17.771
Do you have

07:16.603 --> 07:17.771
a death wish?

07:17.812 --> 07:19.314
Just let me have him one night.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.648
I love him, and he loves me.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.649
Please, please!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.484
Okay, Dewey, relax.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.652
We won't tell.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.322
Thank you!

07:27.364 --> 07:28.740
So, when do we tell?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.742
As soon as

07:28.782 --> 07:30.742
Dad gets home.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.119
It'll be funnier.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.079
I couldn't sleep at all

07:32.160 --> 07:34.079
last night.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.415
Me, too. It's like there's

07:34.121 --> 07:36.415
something creepy in the air.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.624
SPANGLER:

07:36.456 --> 07:37.624
Francis!

07:41.169 --> 07:42.503
Commandant Spangler.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.172
(pans clattering)

07:45.257 --> 07:46.716
What are you doing

07:45.257 --> 07:46.716
in Alaska?

07:46.758 --> 07:49.510
I've come for  you,  Francis!

07:49.552 --> 07:53.432
I've been searching for you

07:49.552 --> 07:53.432
for months.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.600
Me? Why?

07:55.642 --> 07:58.145
Why?!

07:58.186 --> 08:01.189
Because...

08:01.231 --> 08:06.320
after 32 years as an educator

08:01.231 --> 08:06.320
and disciplinarian,

08:06.361 --> 08:08.029
your  desertion

08:08.071 --> 08:09.448
stood out as my

08:09.489 --> 08:11.532
only failure--

08:11.574 --> 08:14.035
a  failure  that...

08:14.077 --> 08:17.331
haunted my every waking moment.

08:17.372 --> 08:20.541
I began to see  your face

08:20.583 --> 08:23.544
and those of other

08:20.583 --> 08:23.544
young cadets who didn't

08:23.586 --> 08:26.965
deserve the wrath that I poured

08:23.586 --> 08:26.965
down on their innocent souls.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.217
There was a lawsuit.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.553
Charges were filed.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.389
Disgrace.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.476
I can't even remember the fire.

08:37.517 --> 08:42.147
But I  do  remember the  cause

08:42.189 --> 08:43.564
for all of my

08:43.606 --> 08:45.484
suffering.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.821
I saw the  stupid,  grinning face

08:49.863 --> 08:55.076
of the one person responsible

08:49.863 --> 08:55.076
for all of my suffering.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.371
Who?

08:57.412 --> 08:58.579
(quavering yell):

08:57.412 --> 08:58.579
Die!

08:58.621 --> 09:01.582
Die!

09:01.624 --> 09:03.584
Die!

09:03.626 --> 09:04.836
Die...

09:03.626 --> 09:04.836
Sir, cut it out.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.380
Your hooks are cold.

09:06.421 --> 09:10.550
(drunken sobbing)

09:22.854 --> 09:25.023
And then

09:22.854 --> 09:25.023
Dewey and Marshmallow

09:25.065 --> 09:26.607
killed the evil dragon,

09:26.649 --> 09:28.609
rescued the

09:26.649 --> 09:28.609
poodle princess

09:28.651 --> 09:30.695
and flew all the

09:28.651 --> 09:30.695
way back home.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.615
And they got medals

09:30.737 --> 09:34.615
and big, red capes,

09:34.657 --> 09:36.826
and everybody

09:34.657 --> 09:36.826
loved them.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.620
(whines)

09:39.662 --> 09:41.581
Are you okay?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.126
Marshmallow.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.254
(grunts)

09:45.168 --> 09:47.254
Whoa.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.755
(gasping)

09:50.924 --> 09:52.633
Marshmallow, stop!

09:52.675 --> 09:55.303
LOIS: Boys, I thought I told you

09:52.675 --> 09:55.303
to stay in your room!

09:55.345 --> 09:56.888
Marshmallow, hide!

10:02.519 --> 10:04.729
(growling softly)

10:07.148 --> 10:08.733
I don't understand it!

10:08.775 --> 10:10.527
An entire roast

10:10.569 --> 10:11.945
with your bare hands?!

10:11.986 --> 10:15.656
T-th-the, the

10:11.986 --> 10:15.656
salad, the potatoes,

10:11.986 --> 10:15.656
t-the green beans?!

10:15.698 --> 10:17.951
What do you

10:15.698 --> 10:17.951
have to say for yourself?!

10:17.992 --> 10:19.327
I was hungry, I guess.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.579
This is great.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.662
Let's tell them

10:20.620 --> 10:21.662
about the dog

10:21.704 --> 10:23.331
and really nail

10:21.704 --> 10:23.331
his coffin shut.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.458
Not yet; I

10:23.373 --> 10:24.458
have a hunch.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.377
An entire stick of butter?!

10:27.419 --> 10:28.669
(sotto voce):

10:27.419 --> 10:28.669
Now! Let's tell them now!

10:28.711 --> 10:30.713
Wait for it,

10:28.711 --> 10:30.713
wait for it.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.299
Wait a second.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.510
How could you eat... a candle?

10:35.552 --> 10:36.677
I like candles.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.679
I think they're good.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.889
That's it!

10:39.931 --> 10:43.643
You are going to the hospital

10:39.931 --> 10:43.643
and getting your stomach pumped.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.774
(phone ringing, indistinct

10:48.398 --> 10:49.774
announcement over P.A.)

10:49.816 --> 10:51.692
All right, young man.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.694
I think you're empty.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.363
Well?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.615
He's fine.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.782
We didn't find

10:56.656 --> 10:57.782
any candles,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.326
but we did find

10:57.824 --> 10:59.326
some marbles

10:59.367 --> 11:01.536
and the waistband to

10:59.367 --> 11:01.536
a pair of underpants.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.703
Don't ask.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.914
Thank you, Doctor.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.125
All right, Dewey,

11:04.956 --> 11:07.125
this is the end.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.502
You and your brothers

11:08.543 --> 11:10.711
are now officially

11:08.543 --> 11:10.711
in the red zone.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.380
But...

11:10.753 --> 11:12.380
Red zone, mister!

11:12.422 --> 11:13.714
Now, tomorrow night

11:13.756 --> 11:15.758
I am taking your mother out

11:13.756 --> 11:15.758
on an emergency date.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.346
It will be a beautiful,

11:15.800 --> 11:19.346
romantic, magical evening

11:19.387 --> 11:21.598
that we need very badly,

11:21.640 --> 11:23.724
and nothing

11:21.640 --> 11:23.724
is going to derail it

11:23.766 --> 11:25.684
on penalty of death.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.480
Good.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.941
Do you want your army man?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.778
Okay.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.531
So, how's he doing?

11:37.572 --> 11:39.199
I was up with

11:37.572 --> 11:39.199
him all night.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.408
It got pretty wild

11:40.450 --> 11:43.537
but I think he's

11:40.450 --> 11:43.537
doing better now.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.579
I want to die!

11:44.621 --> 11:47.541
Why can't I just die?

11:47.582 --> 11:48.833
Stop talking

11:47.582 --> 11:48.833
like that, sir.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.628
This is just

11:48.875 --> 11:51.628
a momentary setback.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.005
I have nothing to live for.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.633
Mother no longer

11:54.047 --> 11:56.633
acknowledges me.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.843
I have no friends, no money.

11:58.885 --> 12:03.640
I won't even tell you how I paid

11:58.885 --> 12:03.640
for my journey up here.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.808
If it means anything

12:03.682 --> 12:05.808
to you, sir,

12:05.850 --> 12:08.019
you taught me

12:05.850 --> 12:08.019
how to be a man.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.272
I have no idea

12:08.061 --> 12:11.272
who you are.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.691
You don't remember me?

12:12.731 --> 12:13.858
After all that

12:12.731 --> 12:13.858
time at Marlin,

12:13.900 --> 12:15.776
the hell that you

12:13.900 --> 12:15.776
put me through,

12:15.818 --> 12:17.445
you don't even

12:15.818 --> 12:17.445
remember me?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.990
Cadet Dudley?

12:21.032 --> 12:23.076
No! Eric!

12:23.117 --> 12:25.579
I just spent the last

12:23.117 --> 12:25.579
ten hours cradling you!

12:25.620 --> 12:28.164
Sir, this is because

12:25.620 --> 12:28.164
you're not feeling useful.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.957
Look, I've talked

12:28.206 --> 12:29.957
to some people

12:29.999 --> 12:32.252
and I think I may

12:29.999 --> 12:32.252
have found you a job.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.794
A what?

12:33.836 --> 12:34.837
It'd be with

12:33.836 --> 12:34.837
the Interior Department.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.673
You'd be helping

12:34.879 --> 12:36.673
the environment,

12:36.715 --> 12:37.798
working with people--

12:37.840 --> 12:39.842
you would be making

12:37.840 --> 12:39.842
a real difference.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.802
I can do that.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.639
Thank you, son.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.015
And please, thank that girl

12:46.057 --> 12:48.767
for rocking me in her arms

12:46.057 --> 12:48.767
all night long.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.779
(retching)

13:04.867 --> 13:06.202
All right,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.202
who's ready

13:06.244 --> 13:08.663
for a fantastic

13:06.244 --> 13:08.663
night on the town?

13:08.705 --> 13:09.664
Oh...

13:09.706 --> 13:11.082
Hal, they're beautiful.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.333
Just give me

13:12.375 --> 13:15.295
two minutes to freshen up

13:12.375 --> 13:15.295
and I'll be ready to roll.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.838
Just stay put, Dewey.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.132
You're doing great.

13:19.173 --> 13:22.843
We've been in here

13:19.173 --> 13:22.843
for  three hours.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.847
Hey, I'm just looking out

13:22.885 --> 13:26.847
for your best interest.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.433
Okay, Dad just

13:26.889 --> 13:28.433
came home.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.226
Let's tell them now

13:28.475 --> 13:30.226
so it ruins their date.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.145
Or, we can wait till

13:30.268 --> 13:32.145
they come home

13:32.186 --> 13:33.563
and they might

13:32.186 --> 13:33.563
be drunk.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.022
This is true.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.232
All right, boys--

13:36.274 --> 13:37.942
your father and I

13:36.274 --> 13:37.942
are leaving now.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.153
I left the number for the

13:37.984 --> 13:40.153
restaurant on the counter.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.280
(retching in other room)

13:40.194 --> 13:42.280
If we get a call,

13:40.194 --> 13:42.280
it better be from the coroner.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.240
(toilet flushing)

13:42.322 --> 13:44.240
Nothing is going to ruin

13:42.322 --> 13:44.240
this night!

13:44.282 --> 13:49.329
M'lady, your

13:44.282 --> 13:49.329
carriage awaits.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.956
(giggling)

13:53.916 --> 13:55.710
Well, I'm out of here.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.919
Back at 10:00?

13:56.961 --> 13:57.878
Sounds good.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.589
Dewey, you and

13:57.920 --> 13:59.589
your dopey dog

13:59.631 --> 14:01.257
are on your own

13:59.631 --> 14:01.257
for an hour or two.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.384
Nope.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.384
What are you talking about?

14:03.426 --> 14:04.761
Did something

14:03.426 --> 14:04.761
happen to the dog?

14:04.803 --> 14:06.513
Oh, he's fine.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.513
He's just busy destroying

14:06.554 --> 14:07.888
your comic book collection.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.847
What?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.103
(snarling)

14:15.021 --> 14:16.690
That's it.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.775
You're getting rid

14:16.731 --> 14:18.775
of that thing right now!

14:18.817 --> 14:20.151
And  you're  going

14:18.817 --> 14:20.151
to pay for this!

14:20.193 --> 14:22.570
I don't think so.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.570
Oh, I

14:20.193 --> 14:22.570
think so.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.572
(barking)

14:24.614 --> 14:25.865
(gasping)

14:26.949 --> 14:28.117
(barking)

14:28.159 --> 14:30.704
Sit!

14:30.745 --> 14:31.912
(growling)

14:31.954 --> 14:33.998
I wasn't talking to him.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.835
(growling continues)

14:44.759 --> 14:46.553
Ever since

14:44.759 --> 14:46.553
the day I was born,

14:46.594 --> 14:49.556
you guys

14:46.594 --> 14:49.556
have been  torturing me.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.726
I remember you trying to switch

14:49.597 --> 14:52.726
me for another baby at the park.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.812
I remember you telling me

14:52.767 --> 14:55.812
the tooth fairy was a vampire.

14:55.854 --> 14:56.937
I remember every

14:56.979 --> 14:59.232
wet Willie,

14:56.979 --> 14:59.232
every booger sandwich,

14:59.273 --> 15:00.817
every stink hat...

15:00.859 --> 15:01.942
Dewey, we're sorry.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.945
...every waffle butt,

15:01.984 --> 15:04.945
every chester backster

15:04.987 --> 15:07.031
and every purple nurple!

15:07.073 --> 15:08.032
And now

15:08.074 --> 15:09.576
you're going to  pay.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.951
(barks)

15:10.993 --> 15:12.829
Dewey, this isn't

15:10.993 --> 15:12.829
going to work.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.038
Mom and Dad will be home

15:12.871 --> 15:14.038
in a few hours,

15:14.080 --> 15:17.124
that dog will be gone,

15:14.080 --> 15:17.124
you'll be in trouble,

15:17.166 --> 15:19.126
and we'll kick your ass

15:17.166 --> 15:19.126
for the next ten years.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.127
I know.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.880
So we'd better get started.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.172
What do you want?

15:24.215 --> 15:25.884
Everything.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.969
I want everything.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.599
Hal, this place

15:29.011 --> 15:32.599
is beautiful.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.474
It's so romantic.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.017
Everything is

15:33.516 --> 15:35.017
fabulous.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.977
Yes, it is fabulous.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.020
Look, they have

15:38.062 --> 15:39.188
your favorite-- oysters!

15:39.230 --> 15:40.607
We'll have to order

15:39.230 --> 15:40.607
some of those.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.483
Actually,

15:40.648 --> 15:42.483
I had a big batch

15:42.525 --> 15:43.984
of oysters for lunch.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.361
You did?

15:45.403 --> 15:46.654
Where did you

15:45.403 --> 15:46.654
get oysters?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.615
A guy has a cart

15:46.696 --> 15:48.615
outside the building.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.410
Besides, I am dying

15:48.656 --> 15:52.410
to try this plain broth--

15:52.452 --> 15:53.703
they're famous for it.

15:53.745 --> 15:54.995
For their broth?

15:53.745 --> 15:54.995
What are you talking about?

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
Is that your friend Suzy

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
from work?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
Who, that fat old man?

15:59.041 --> 16:02.002
Never mind.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.002
I'm just so excited to be here.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.379
Excuse me, sorry.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.547
Please,

16:04.589 --> 16:05.924
could you turn the air

16:04.589 --> 16:05.924
conditioning like

16:05.965 --> 16:07.007
10-15 degrees colder?

16:07.049 --> 16:09.009
Okay.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.387
Okay...

16:11.429 --> 16:14.098
Hal... what are

16:11.429 --> 16:14.098
you up to?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.683
I'll never tell.

16:15.725 --> 16:16.935
I love this.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.729
I'm having such

16:16.976 --> 16:19.729
a great time.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.273
Me, too.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.734
Excuse me.

16:24.776 --> 16:25.985
Hurry back.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.531
(shuddering)

16:30.573 --> 16:32.199
Excuse me.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.326
I need your help.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.829
Here-- here's $20.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.038
Go and buy me some medicine--

16:35.870 --> 16:38.038
some cold medicine--

16:38.080 --> 16:39.833
and serve it to me

16:38.080 --> 16:39.833
in a champagne glass.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.042
But I-I...

16:39.874 --> 16:42.042
Just stop talking and go!

16:42.084 --> 16:44.044
(moaning)

16:44.086 --> 16:46.172
DEWEY:

16:44.086 --> 16:46.172
Pencils down.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.468
Who wants to read

16:47.298 --> 16:50.468
their essay first?

16:51.719 --> 16:54.013
Marshmallow,

16:51.719 --> 16:54.013
why don't you choose?

16:55.765 --> 16:57.642
(barks)

16:57.684 --> 16:59.519
"50 reasons why Dewey

16:59.560 --> 17:00.561
"is the greatest

16:59.560 --> 17:00.561
brother

17:00.603 --> 17:01.771

17:01.813 --> 17:03.272

17:01.813 --> 17:03.272
chunk of garbage."

17:03.314 --> 17:05.483
Is that what we were

17:03.314 --> 17:05.483
supposed to be writing about?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.110
From the top.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.738
"50 reasons why Dewey is the

17:08.152 --> 17:10.738
greatest brother in the...

17:10.780 --> 17:11.906
Stop.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.367
Something's not right.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.037
Wait.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.166
There.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.292
Continue.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.377
(doorbell rings)

17:24.418 --> 17:27.087
Nobody move.

17:24.418 --> 17:27.087
(knocking on door)

17:27.129 --> 17:29.465
CRAIG:

17:27.129 --> 17:29.465
Hello?! I know

17:29.507 --> 17:30.717
someone's home.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.886
I saw shapes moving

17:30.758 --> 17:32.886
on the curtain!

17:32.927 --> 17:35.221
Marshmallow, guard.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.599
Hey, sport,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.599
is your dad home?

17:38.641 --> 17:39.976
No, they went to a restaurant,

17:40.018 --> 17:41.936
but they said  you

17:40.018 --> 17:41.936
should go over...

17:41.978 --> 17:43.479
Well, I just came

17:41.978 --> 17:43.479
to drop off some pants.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.147
They got out...

17:43.521 --> 17:45.147
Craig, help!

17:45.189 --> 17:46.566
REESE:

17:45.189 --> 17:46.566
Help up, please!

17:46.607 --> 17:47.567
Dewey's gone crazy.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.526
He's holding us prisoner.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.069
(Marshmallow growls)

17:52.446 --> 17:55.115
I'm sorry you had to see this.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.117
(Marshmallow growls)

17:57.159 --> 17:59.119
Number 12...

17:59.161 --> 18:01.497
his twinkling eyes.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.707
To us.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.000
To us.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.125
You know, Lois...

18:05.167 --> 18:07.336
LOIS (thinking):

18:05.167 --> 18:07.336
Don't pass out.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.129
No! No, keep it together.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.424
Smile, smile! Laugh!

18:11.465 --> 18:13.133

18:13.175 --> 18:15.053

18:13.175 --> 18:15.053
You're going to throw up.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.346
Okay, if it comes to it,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.346
aim for the ice bucket.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.139

18:32.403 --> 18:35.656

18:35.698 --> 18:39.159
Marshmallow, if anyone moves,

eat  them.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.160
This is insane.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.162
We've got to do something.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.163
I'm Moe.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.331
We don't have

18:43.205 --> 18:44.331
a choice.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.959
I say at the

18:44.373 --> 18:45.959
count of three,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.586
we split up and all run

18:46.000 --> 18:48.586
for different doors.

Are you nuts?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.170
He might get one of us.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.464
MALCOLM:

18:50.212 --> 18:51.464
Yeah, but two of us

18:51.505 --> 18:52.882
will get away

18:51.505 --> 18:52.882
and go for help.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.176
I'm willing if you are.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.176
I can't sing anymore.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.179
Ready? On three.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.347
One...

19:00.389 --> 19:01.808
two...

19:01.849 --> 19:03.059
three.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.560
Go, go, go, go, go,

19:03.101 --> 19:04.560
go, go, go, go!

19:04.602 --> 19:05.603
Go, go, go, go!

19:04.602 --> 19:05.603
(barking)

19:05.645 --> 19:07.105
No. Good dog! No, no!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.273
(screaming)

19:07.146 --> 19:09.273
Ah! Ooh! Not the face!

19:09.315 --> 19:11.191
(screaming)

19:11.233 --> 19:12.192
Craig's a good guy.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.028
He always comes

19:12.234 --> 19:14.028
through for us.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.029
I couldn't find

19:15.071 --> 19:16.447
any rusty scissors,

19:15.071 --> 19:16.447
so we're going to have

19:16.489 --> 19:18.407
to use...

19:18.449 --> 19:19.575
Where is he?

19:19.617 --> 19:21.243
He should have

19:19.617 --> 19:21.243
been back by now.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.286
Look at this,

19:21.285 --> 19:22.286
my palms are sweaty.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.164
Would you calm down?

19:22.328 --> 19:25.164
Here he comes.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.293
So?

19:29.335 --> 19:34.007
(slurring):

19:29.335 --> 19:34.007
For some reason, I was fired.

19:34.048 --> 19:37.510
I don't believe it,

19:34.048 --> 19:37.510
he's drunk again.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.512
You're just going to have

19:37.551 --> 19:39.512
to face it, Francis--

19:39.553 --> 19:41.221
there's no hope

19:39.553 --> 19:41.221
for this guy.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.890
The only thing that ever

19:41.263 --> 19:42.890
made him remotely happy

19:42.932 --> 19:46.019
was tormenting

19:42.932 --> 19:46.019
and bullying helpless students.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.728
Without that, he's nothing.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.026
You call that a collage?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.401
Is it an  insult

19:54.443 --> 19:55.862
to the craft.

19:55.903 --> 20:00.116
I can see paste coming up over

19:55.903 --> 20:00.116
the top of the Popsicle stick.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.701
I'm sorry, I have arthritis.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.660
That's it.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.245
You have just lost pudding

20:05.287 --> 20:07.247
for the whole group.

20:07.289 --> 20:12.503
Feel free to thank

20:07.289 --> 20:12.503
Mrs. Meekitjuk after I leave.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.259
I feel like dancing.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.012
Me, too.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.789
Oh, darling,

20:47.329 --> 20:48.789
there's something

20:48.831 --> 20:50.166
I've wanted

20:48.831 --> 20:50.166
to say to you

20:50.208 --> 20:51.291
for the longest time.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.168
Uh-huh?

20:52.210 --> 20:55.922
I have to go

20:52.210 --> 20:55.922
to the hospital.

20:55.963 --> 21:00.593
Oh, Hal, you don't know

20:55.963 --> 21:00.593
how happy that makes me.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.304
REESE:

21:01.385 --> 21:04.304
What do you think?

21:04.346 --> 21:05.347
One more can?

21:05.389 --> 21:07.391
No, we don't want

21:05.389 --> 21:07.391
to spoil him.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.351
Besides,

21:07.433 --> 21:09.351
he probably has to go

21:09.393 --> 21:10.770
to the bathroom now.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.147
Who wants to go out

21:10.811 --> 21:13.147
in the front yard?

21:13.189 --> 21:16.025
I'll remember  this,  too.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.485
"And how can words

21:16.067 --> 21:18.485
describe how I feel

21:18.527 --> 21:20.738
on this, the day

21:18.527 --> 21:20.738
of our marriage?"

21:20.780 --> 21:24.033
"You are my day, my night,

21:20.780 --> 21:24.033
the sun in my sky.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.702
You are the Duran

21:24.075 --> 21:26.702
to my Duran."

21:26.744 --> 21:29.329
Oh, Hal.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.708
"Her name is Lois and

21:29.371 --> 21:32.708
she dances on the sand

21:32.750 --> 21:35.586
just like that river twisting

21:32.750 --> 21:35.586
through a dusty land..."
