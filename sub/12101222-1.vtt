Tunnelen 2019 (The Tunnel)

00:36.344 --> 00:41.287
There are over 1100 tunnels in Norway.
Most people have no emergency room.

00:41.755 --> 00:47.031
The tunnel security is based on that
everyone has a responsibility to get themselves out.

00:47.998 --> 00:51.553
Since 2011, Norway has had
Eight large tunnel fires.

00:51.578 --> 00:55.717
Just coincidence and helplessness
has made no one dead.

00:55.742 --> 01:00.060
This movie is inspired
of these events.

01:36.742 --> 01:39.064
Dad won't come.

01:40.780 --> 01:45.972
He's busy with Ingrid.
I'll probably have a new family soon.

Keep focus and smooth speed,
so you're not stuck.

03:32.503 --> 03:36.198
Easy to see.
I have to look down to change.

03:48.904 --> 03:53.457
Ivar? Have you lost control completely?
in the back?

03:53.482 --> 03:59.452
No, the damn ass just flew out
out of the column and past you.

03:59.477 --> 04:02.657
- You have to stop him.
- I don't see him.

04:02.682 --> 04:06.778
- He could stop him before the tunnel.
- We'll see how far he comes.

04:06.803 --> 04:10.372
It is mirrorless about 500 meters.

04:13.422 --> 04:17.851
- How's it going down there?
- Some people have started coming.

04:17.875 --> 04:21.971
Children are hearing and looking and happy.

04:21.997 --> 04:27.772
- Did you hear the storm hit the Christmas tree?
- No! Did it?

04:28.615 --> 04:33.807
Hi. It was Christian.
Have you talked to Elise?

04:34.984 --> 04:39.039
No.
It got really good last week.

04:39.064 --> 04:44.324
Now it's just two days left.
We drop it. I'm not doing anything.

04:44.349 --> 04:48.278
- I like to be alone.
- Not on Christmas Eve.

04:48.303 --> 04:53.830
I want you to be there.
I'll take it with Elise tonight.

04:55.048 --> 05:00.697
Something's been going on.
I have to put it on. We hear.

05:04.829 --> 05:07.677
Silverfish? No, that's wrong.

05:07.702 --> 05:12.728
I didn't sell an apartment
I knew there were silver fish.

05:13.613 --> 05:17.667
Hey!
Are you bringing me up on the wall again?

05:17.692 --> 05:20.581
You can't drive in the column.

05:20.606 --> 05:25.534
Was it a column? I'm in a hurry.
I had to make it to the Christmas ending.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.961
- Hello. Is it good?
- Yes.

05:32.344 --> 05:36.108
Can't you just pull me up?
What do you take before that?

05:36.133 --> 05:40.685
Can't wait, many are waiting. I can
Call a citizen, but it will take time.

05:40.710 --> 05:44.181
- Sure.
- You're with the boy at your own risk?

05:44.206 --> 05:47.971
Right.
But how long does it take?

Just a little paperwork left.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.525
I do not think so.

06:34.034 --> 06:40.460
- Do you open the road?
- Now it's black asphalt all the way.

06:40.485 --> 06:44.873
- Did you see the drive by the Chair?
- It should be nice, Stein.

06:44.898 --> 06:49.299
We have to get people home for Christmas, okay?
That's how we do it.

06:50.475 --> 06:53.406
- Do you check the technology room?
- Yes.

06:53.431 --> 06:55.960
Come on, d�!

07:12.370 --> 07:15.552
You have a new message.

07:15.577 --> 07:19.171
Hi dad.
I'm standing at my mother's grave.

07:19.196 --> 07:23.224

08:08.982 --> 08:12.369

09:56.833 --> 10:01.888
It should be more snow. Tea cups should
not through the tunnel until tonight.

11:01.519 --> 11:04.700
Hi. Can I go to Bergen?

11:04.725 --> 11:08.904
I'm not allowed to bring passengers

- It might miss us.

11:47.309 --> 11:50.903

We've done it before.

11:50.928 --> 11:55.442
It's a pure ride. You know
how fast the weather changes up there.

11:55.467 --> 11:59.105

I made 50 liters to your market.

Do you know when he's coming?

13:59.095 --> 14:03.372
He's on his way. I just talked

14:05.964 --> 14:10.434
It's not very snowy this year, is it?
You promised it to your Christmas market.

14:10.459 --> 14:14.263
Do not pull the climate card.
It's a lot of snow.

14:14.288 --> 14:17.275

So long ago, I was expecting you.

15:45.407 --> 15:50.058

- But you did come here.

15:54.481 --> 15:58.577
How long can you hold your breath now?

15:58.602 --> 16:02.422
New record? Take my time.

16:05.928 --> 16:09.665
I'm not ten years older. Shut off.

16:11.049 --> 16:14.618
Sharpen it. Stop.

Hey! Are you hungry?

16:23.370 --> 16:28.340

- He wants to be funny.

16:28.365 --> 16:33.044
- I'm trying to beat Elise.
- You're not even around.

16:33.069 --> 16:36.347
Before I invite you to a Christmas lunch?

16:38.397 --> 16:43.243
No thanks.
- You wanna talk to me about something?

16:43.268 --> 16:48.750
Yes. We can take it now.

16:49.594 --> 16:55.120
Ingrid and I talked a little about Christmas.
It would have been nice if ...

16:59.251 --> 17:02.862
... we celebrated all three together.

17:05.702 --> 17:09.757
You have no others
to celebrate Christmas with, Ingrid?

17:09.781 --> 17:13.601
- No I have not. But...
- Are you pregnant?

17:16.817 --> 17:18.637
No.

17:22.810 --> 17:27.046
- It was just a suggestion.
- So now I get a new mom?

17:29.263 --> 17:35.482
- You never talk about Mom again.
- We can talk a lot more about mom.

17:35.507 --> 17:38.911
Do you think
l just forget mommy?

17:42.127 --> 17:45.404
We shouldn't forget Mom.

17:50.492 --> 17:53.271
We should never forget Mom.

17:55.029 --> 17:58.349
You and I will never forget Mom.

so is that what you are bringing forward?

18:13.262 --> 18:18.372
It's just "Ingrid, Ingrid, Ingrid"
continuously. Damn it!

18:19.382 --> 18:24.907
- Elise? Where are you going now?
- You and Ingrid can do that!

18:35.157 --> 18:37.271

19:03.170 --> 19:06.907
Just saw you,
Then we take the ticket late.

19:13.328 --> 19:18.132
No, it was a youth. We hope

- I hate you!

19:47.377 --> 19:50.655
Now you stop! Nobody hates anyone.

19:52.997 --> 19:57.468
- It's not just your hamster.
- You said Harry was just mine.

19:57.493 --> 20:01.712
We'll share him. Can you say
that the hamster is for both, Mom?

20:01.737 --> 20:06.250
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Do you have alvedon?

20:06.275 --> 20:11.426
- No, I have diabetes tablets.
- It doesn't help with Christmas dinner.

- Is that the gasoline you drive?

26:20.366 --> 26:23.129
Close tunnel. Close tunnel.

26:23.154 --> 26:24.975

26:27.608 --> 26:31.579
You know how often I've been driving here
since I moved here?

26:31.604 --> 26:36.797
Wait. That's bad coverage. We're driving
in the tunnel now. No, wide open.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.293

- It doesn't! I'm stuck, Tom!
- You have to get out.

27:45.407 --> 27:49.711
Okay, Tom. We take it easy.
The tunnel is 9 km long.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.514
Did you drive in from the east or west?

27:54.854 --> 27:58.827
Tom, do you see an emergency phone
or a fire extinguisher near you?

27:58.852 --> 28:03.447
- Take it down, and I'll see where you are.
- I drove in from afar.

28:03.472 --> 28:08.734
- I'm looking for a truck.
- No, you can't go past anyone.

28:08.759 --> 28:11.663
Hall? Do you hear me?

28:14.503 --> 28:19.529
But what did you do now?
It's not my truck! VND!

28:22.953 --> 28:26.050
Tom, they go. I'll try again.

28:26.075 --> 28:29.796
Back, so you come around me and out.

28:29.821 --> 28:34.542
Now I have closed the tunnel,
but don't get the driver.

28:34.567 --> 28:38.954
- Do you know he was in the tunnel?
- 2-3 kilometers a mile.

28:38.979 --> 28:43.547
- But it could be more.
- I call the ambulance and the police.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.877
V�STSIDAN, 4 KM IN

28:55.337 --> 28:59.947
- Is that a column?
- No, it's probably an accident.

29:01.082 --> 29:04.776
- We'll be sitting there all Christmas.
- All right with me.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.935
We go out and see what has happened.

29:15.901 --> 29:18.873
Don't we have a camera in the tunnel?

29:18.898 --> 29:23.716
No, just a webcam
at the column boom.

29:29.387 --> 29:35.704
VTS, Egil Ramsvik.
Yes. The cave tunnel is closed.

29:38.462 --> 29:40.019
In 12.11

29:40.044 --> 29:44.239
We have no overview
About the damage so far.

29:50.076 --> 29:53.145
Tom, are you there?

29:55.362 --> 30:01.415
Marius? He drove in from 12/11.
When did you get the alarm about the accident?

30:01.440 --> 30:05.410
- We got the alarm 12.14.
- That's three minutes later.

30:05.435 --> 30:09.614
We don't know how long after the accident
he called and how fast he drove.

30:09.639 --> 30:12.459
3.5 min reaction time ...

30:13.678 --> 30:17.830
He keeps the speed limit
he goes 2-3 km in.

30:21.710 --> 30:25.890
Sierra 0-1 responds.
Stange fire truck goes out.

30:25.915 --> 30:29.803
- Come as soon as you can.
- We can be there in 50 minutes.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.466
It has been a tanker accident
in the tunnel. It doesn't burn.

30:33.491 --> 30:36.755
But we have to get up
the local fire truck to the tunnel.

30:36.780 --> 30:41.375
Is Stange on the move? They've got stuff.
We don't have a shit on the west side.

30:41.400 --> 30:45.496
Yes, they do,
but you need on the west side.

30:45.521 --> 30:48.383
- Hall�?
- Come on, H�kon!

30:52.805 --> 30:56.749
- Testing! Do you hear me?
- Yes!

30:57.343 --> 31:03.825
We will hear the tradition faithfully in Vik
sing Christmas in the fifth grade.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.736
Christian.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.716
According to the contingency plan
Stange has the responsibility.

31:14.741 --> 31:20.975
- It's a damn sight on the top side.
- Then we'll be the first man up.

31:24.940 --> 31:28.454
I think she needs
before you talk to her.

31:28.479 --> 31:31.992
I'm sorry, I'm not getting it.

31:32.017 --> 31:34.754
Yes, you get it.

31:37.388 --> 31:41.248
- You bring it to me.
- It's a pure ride.

31:44.046 --> 31:47.852
- Christian.
- He chased you. Take it.

31:47.877 --> 31:51.154
- No, forget it.
- Stop!

31:52.581 --> 31:55.260
- Stone.
- You're not giving up.

31:55.285 --> 32:00.563
The Relief Corps needs you.
A tanker truck has crashed in the tunnel.

32:01.903 --> 32:05.750
- A new message.
- Hi, Elise, it's Dad.

32:05.775 --> 32:12.468
I don't decide, we do.
I'm out now and going in.

32:13.434 --> 32:15.215
Hi there.

32:16.390 --> 32:18.627
I have no cover.

32:21.759 --> 32:26.036
- It must be an accident.
- Can't we just go out?

32:33.332 --> 32:35.861
- Hi dad.
- Hello.

32:36.786 --> 32:40.259
- Aren't you Christmas?
- I called him.

32:40.284 --> 32:43.462
We need the best on the job now.

32:43.487 --> 32:47.584
We're gonna get the fire truck up
to the tunnel.

32:47.609 --> 32:51.663
I've talked to the police
and they have at least an hour there.

32:51.688 --> 32:54.203
We do it ourselves.

32:54.228 --> 32:57.908
Have you talked to the fire department
in Stange? Are they informed?

32:57.933 --> 33:02.444
The traffic center called me,
so I do as they say.

33:02.469 --> 33:08.854
Ivar! It sounds like a rescue effort
and I have commanded her now.

33:08.879 --> 33:12.032
Stein, you drive the leader car.

33:31.316 --> 33:34.996
- Where's the rest of your crew?
- Just working.

33:35.021 --> 33:40.074
If it gets serious up there
So I need you.

33:40.099 --> 33:42.502
Get dressed.

33:46.592 --> 33:51.204
KNOW, INFART �ST

33:55.043 --> 33:58.806
Whether it should be a column
then it blows wide.

33:58.831 --> 34:02.094
After all, the distance was up
when we drove up.

34:02.119 --> 34:07.005
- Sara says she's in charge.
- Damn shit.

34:07.030 --> 34:11.501
If you don't stop, I'll throw you out,
so you go all the way to grandma!

34:11.525 --> 34:13.847
You can't, Mom!

34:15.856 --> 34:18.744
- Aren't we just gonna do that?
- No.

34:18.768 --> 34:21.839
- Do we have power?
- We have plenty of power.

34:23.223 --> 34:25.293
Mia. Mia.

34:27.094 --> 34:29.498
Amen, my God!

34:32.755 --> 34:35.326
Damn, it's small!

34:42.163 --> 34:46.815
- Where's the tanker?
- Right, I think. On the west side.

34:48.782 --> 34:52.795
- What is it?
- A fire extinguisher was just taken down.

34:52.820 --> 34:56.623
- On the west side? Does that mean?
- No.

34:56.649 --> 35:00.994
Fire ventilation is started
when someone takes down a fire extinguisher.

35:01.020 --> 35:06.114
- The sensors show if it is burning.
- Okay. It doesn't burn.

35:06.139 --> 35:10.458
But I want to know
exactly the tanker was big.

35:10.927 --> 35:13.455
Yes? That's right.

35:15.671 --> 35:17.992
Come on, Tom.

35:22.831 --> 35:25.929
The fire ventilation was just started.

35:25.954 --> 35:30.799
- How far from Stange fire station?
- I'll check. Hang on.

35:30.824 --> 35:34.476
FJ�LLKROG, �STSIDAN

35:37.483 --> 35:44.659
A guy had to help someone who had
off the road. Here we go.

35:44.684 --> 35:49.627
I will fix it. Yes.
Yes, that's true.

35:51.304 --> 35:55.150
- I want brown Christmas!
- Now it's all red.

35:55.175 --> 35:58.827
Which expert did you talk to?
Pest Control?

36:00.253 --> 36:07.235
Okay. How many silverfish
have you found? 3-4 pieces or?

36:08.869 --> 36:10.968
Okay.

36:10.993 --> 36:14.505
But do you know what we're doing now? Damn!

36:14.530 --> 36:20.749
- I want brown Christmas!
- Now Joseph is going to drink that hard liquor.

36:20.774 --> 36:25.260
Then God doesn't want to hear about it anymore
jullsk. Do you understand? It will be fine.

36:35.842 --> 36:38.662
VSTSIDAN

36:43.252 --> 36:47.404
- They seem to struggle.
- It's a vintage car card.

36:48.913 --> 36:53.052
Christian? Have you heard more
from the traffic control center?

36:53.077 --> 36:55.729
No, not yet.

36:58.946 --> 37:03.346
Back as firefighter again.
Why did you end up with it?

37:04.648 --> 37:08.135
I promised Mona
to take care of Elise.

37:17.801 --> 37:21.689
- They can't do it. They had to go out.
- I'll tell them.

37:21.714 --> 37:26.643
No, no, no filmmaking.
You have to drive out. Run out.

37:26.668 --> 37:31.611
Don't film. Nine must-haves are
in your cars and drive out loud.

37:32.454 --> 37:36.481
Girls, nothing filmmaking.
Get into your cars.

38:18.825 --> 38:23.795
- Everyone in the bus!
- It doesn't sound good.

38:23.820 --> 38:28.430
- What was it for audio?
- Get in the bus, everyone. Come on!

38:36.307 --> 38:39.128
Stay in your places.

38:49.378 --> 38:51.159
Running!

39:19.765 --> 39:24.735
- Hall�? Do you hear me?
- Why don't you ride the bus?

39:24.760 --> 39:29.106
- I can't get in here.
- Back then, right now.

39:29.130 --> 39:33.476
- You must expect it.
- Listen to her! She's right!

39:33.501 --> 39:36.765
- Just kill it!
- We all die if we stop.

39:36.790 --> 39:40.608
Is anyone here?
It's burning in the tunnel.

39:42.493 --> 39:44.688
What is it?

39:45.573 --> 39:48.879
- Is it all right?
- Yes, the rash on several sensors.

39:48.904 --> 39:52.540
- The tanker?
- Probably. But I do not know.

39:52.565 --> 39:54.970
Wait a bit.

39:59.059 --> 40:03.905
We have multiple sensors
in the tunnel, both east and west.

40:03.930 --> 40:06.778
- So it's burning now?
- Undoubtedly.

40:06.803 --> 40:11.772
Alarm rescue and air alarms
ambulance. How high is the tunnel?

40:11.797 --> 40:14.476
950 meters above sea level.

40:14.501 --> 40:18.640
Stange fire truck is not coming
on the east side.

40:18.665 --> 40:23.012
- What's going on?
- They're not coming up on the top.

40:23.037 --> 40:26.813
The press is calling and calling.
What should I say?

40:27.531 --> 40:32.182
- Traffic center west.
- We're in the middle of the Storfjellet tunnel ...

40:52.715 --> 40:54.687
What did they say?

40:54.712 --> 40:58.851
It's burning in a car longer in.
It's quiet.

40:58.876 --> 41:03.777
Let's just go for recycling
and then we come out here.

41:05.537 --> 41:08.508
Is it dangerous?

41:08.533 --> 41:12.809
No, that's good.
That's good. It's going so well.

41:13.986 --> 41:16.056
Mom, look.

41:19.730 --> 41:21.802
Oh my God!

41:29.886 --> 41:32.817
- Shut the door!
- He's passionate, we have to ...

41:32.842 --> 41:34.538
Just wait.

41:42.916 --> 41:45.028
- What are we doing now?
- Do not know.

41:48.076 --> 41:50.549
Out! Everyone out of the car - now!

41:50.574 --> 41:54.587
Out! G� with mom!
Go to Mom, Go to Mom.

41:54.612 --> 41:57.543
- Mom!
- I've got you.

41:57.568 --> 42:01.554
- Dad, Dad.
- David!

42:02.605 --> 42:04.510
Dad!

42:16.465 --> 42:19.772
- Did you get the one I got?
- Yes.

42:19.797 --> 42:24.683
- Have any of them seen Elise?
- Yeah, I saw her in the swimming pool.

42:24.708 --> 42:28.234
- Okay.
- There is total chaos in the tunnel now.

42:29.078 --> 42:33.272
Have you seen it here?
It is total chaos.

42:36.029 --> 42:38.268
Thousand thanks.

42:41.233 --> 42:46.495
- Hall�? Stein? Where are you?
- We're on our way up to the tunnel.

42:46.520 --> 42:50.032
- It may take a few hours.
- What's going on?

42:50.057 --> 42:54.335
Nobody knows. No one has come up.
You haven't seen Elise?

42:57.301 --> 43:00.856
Can you drive past and just check?

43:00.881 --> 43:06.905
Yes. Yes absolutely.
Be careful, Stein.

43:29.185 --> 43:34.212
- Damn it. What's going on here?
- A tanker truck.

43:49.750 --> 43:52.263
I go and see them.

43:52.288 --> 43:56.216
- What should I do?
- Open the emergency locker.

43:56.241 --> 44:00.312
The crew from Vik
It's on the west side.

44:06.524 --> 44:10.078
- Okay! Crowbar!
- Comes!

44:10.103 --> 44:13.451
- Are there more people in there?
- Do not know. It was horrible.

44:13.476 --> 44:17.862
- There are a lot of people in there.
- You have to come in and help them.

44:17.887 --> 44:21.915
Yes, we should.
- Kurt, take him who is there.

44:41.115 --> 44:44.586
There are a lot of people in the tunnel.
Are the fans?

44:44.611 --> 44:48.167
The fire ventilation is on the west.

44:48.192 --> 44:49.997
Against us?

44:50.022 --> 44:55.075
According to the contingency plan
evacuation will take place from Stange.

44:55.100 --> 44:58.240
- Entry �st.
- They have all the equipment.

44:58.265 --> 45:02.569
- Are they in place on the other side?
- There was an avalanche on the other side.

45:02.595 --> 45:05.733
They're working their way through the snow now.

45:05.758 --> 45:08.396
- On this side, is it just us?
- Yes.

45:08.421 --> 45:11.325
- When did it start?
- I'm not getting in touch.

45:12.417 --> 45:18.777
- It never worked out here.
- Get the fans, so we go in.

45:30.024 --> 45:33.220
THE STYLE, �STSIDAN

45:38.766 --> 45:41.821
Come back so we can change plows!

45:41.846 --> 45:45.318
- Are they coming in?
- No, the smoke goes straight towards them.

45:45.343 --> 45:51.021
- We're gonna blow the fans to East.
- But does it burn in the east or in the west?

45:51.046 --> 45:53.020
Oh, no doubt.

45:53.045 --> 45:58.806
He may have entered a maximum of 3 km before
he ran into the wall. Probably less.

45:58.831 --> 46:02.842
But a fire extinguisher was taken down
2 km on the west side.

46:02.867 --> 46:05.770
Where does the smoke come out first?

46:08.154 --> 46:12.333
Out: 12.52, exit �st.

46:12.358 --> 46:14.790
12.52 exit �st.

46:14.815 --> 46:18.119
- Exit where do you go?
- We don't know, no witnesses.

46:18.144 --> 46:22.157
- The smoke is out there too.
- We don't know where that is.

46:22.182 --> 46:26.570
No one saw the accident, but I'm sure
because it burns 2-3 km into the east.

46:26.595 --> 46:30.081
Those trying to get out to the west
He was caught in the smoke.

46:31.632 --> 46:33.397
300 bar.

46:33.422 --> 46:36.725
They want to know exactly where it is burning
before they turn to the fans.

46:36.750 --> 46:41.346
- It's easy for them to see.
- There are people in there.

46:41.371 --> 46:45.815
You're in control here.
Ivar and I go in and do some searching.

46:47.616 --> 46:52.502
You have 10 minutes in, 10 minutes out.
You take no risks in there.

46:52.527 --> 46:57.914
HRS Rescue 8. We're flying west
about the tunnel in standby position.

46:57.939 --> 47:00.427
Roger.

47:03.724 --> 47:07.918
Hey, it's Elise.
I can't answer right now.

47:21.041 --> 47:23.096
It's okay.

47:23.121 --> 47:26.885
Bring it here,
so you don't lose the signal.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.189
Okay. We're going in.

48:05.539 --> 48:07.485
Merry Christmas.

48:14.364 --> 48:17.934
- What are you doing?
- Self-help.

48:27.808 --> 48:32.169
- Anyone come and help us?
- No one can drive into the smoke.

48:34.635 --> 48:37.331
We have to get out ourselves.

48:47.164 --> 48:53.134
- David, you must call.
- But nothing works.

48:53.159 --> 48:57.520
But you must do it!
Come on, please.

49:01.566 --> 49:04.622
Damn, there's no covering.

49:04.647 --> 49:09.216
- But fuck it, damn it!
- Stay there.

49:10.725 --> 49:12.753
Dad.

49:18.466 --> 49:21.605
- Dad!
- Right. Take care of your sister!

49:21.630 --> 49:24.991
- Mom!
- David! David!

49:28.458 --> 49:30.154
Mother!

49:39.238 --> 49:43.001
- Follow me.
- I can not see anything.

49:43.026 --> 49:45.513
I check the car.

49:49.853 --> 49:54.379
Christian to Stein.
Do you get a rash?

50:02.091 --> 50:06.187
No temperature rise.
The fire is getting longer.

50:06.212 --> 50:09.697
Going a long way eastward.

50:10.250 --> 50:12.238
Ivar?

50:18.158 --> 50:21.879
- What the hell?
- I told you to stop feeding me.

50:21.904 --> 50:25.667
Just breathe calmly.
Okay? We'll go in longer.

50:25.692 --> 50:29.429
- Longer in?
- We need to go in, Ivar.

50:30.272 --> 50:34.216
Yes. No, I can't do it anymore.

50:34.683 --> 50:36.921
Handset off

50:40.346 --> 50:44.580
- Help me!
- Who are you?

50:45.631 --> 50:51.934
- Anatol Kaminski, driver.
- Do you see the fire, Anatol?

50:51.959 --> 50:57.928
I saw the idea explode. Big
explosion. My face melted.

50:57.953 --> 51:05.226
- Where's the fire?
- Tom and I drove a maximum of 2 km.

51:06.361 --> 51:10.456
I can't go anymore.
No air inside.

51:10.481 --> 51:14.994
Listen to me, Anatol.
Find a car and stay there.

51:15.019 --> 51:18.671
Run ac: n on recycling.

51:24.260 --> 51:29.438
Okay, everyone. Listen up.
The fire is now confirmed by a witness.

51:29.463 --> 51:32.395
2 km in front, 7 km in front.

51:32.419 --> 51:36.279
- Are we completely safe?
- Yes. I win the fans now.

51:39.244 --> 51:41.440
Good.

51:56.810 --> 51:58.590
Sara!

52:04.220 --> 52:06.209
Martine!

52:13.877 --> 52:15.782
Sara!

52:18.748 --> 52:21.179
My husband is dead!

52:21.204 --> 52:25.897
My husband is dead.
Have you seen two girls?

52:26.990 --> 52:28.852
Stein?

52:29.737 --> 52:33.972
Do you hear me?
Do you have any problems inside?

52:35.023 --> 52:36.887
Ivar?

52:38.852 --> 52:42.215
Hell. Come out.

52:51.799 --> 52:54.660
Take water.

53:02.746 --> 53:05.011
- Are you okay, Ivar?
- Yeah.

53:05.037 --> 53:07.341
- Water?
- It's okay!

53:07.366 --> 53:10.756
Give him a few minutes.

53:10.781 --> 53:15.042
Do you change tub? It's tough in there,
but no heat.

53:15.067 --> 53:18.539
They've been waiting for the fans
and sends the smoke from us.

53:18.564 --> 53:22.618
- Are the fans at max now?
- Yes, 4 meters a second.

53:22.643 --> 53:25.713
They can go on and on.

53:29.346 --> 53:32.873
- Ivar!
- You don't see a shit in there!

53:38.211 --> 53:42.931
We should have gone with the others.
They're probably out of the tunnel now.

53:42.956 --> 53:46.678
- We're going. Come on.
- It's 4-5 km to walk.

53:46.703 --> 53:49.675
- We quit.
- What the hell do you know about that?

53:49.700 --> 53:53.421
- Let the adults talk.
- I know the tunnel inside and out.

53:53.446 --> 53:57.432
- Dad works here.
- Look at what she has to say.

54:00.731 --> 54:06.007
Father who is in heaven,
hallowed was your name ...

54:17.838 --> 54:21.103
- Open up, fan.
- Don't open.

54:21.128 --> 54:22.991
Open, fan!

54:28.787 --> 54:31.356
Help me.

54:38.235 --> 54:40.265
Lean back.

54:43.939 --> 54:48.575
- I gotta go out, I gotta go out now!
- You can't go out in that smoke now.

54:48.600 --> 54:50.712
Move!

54:52.014 --> 54:54.694
Okay, okay, sir!

54:54.719 --> 54:59.995
I know a room where we can breathe.
Where we can seek protection.

55:05.833 --> 55:12.135
... a traffic accident with a tanker truck
inside the Storefjellet tunnel.

55:12.160 --> 55:16.881
- What kind of fuel is in the tanker?
- I can't comment on that now.

55:16.906 --> 55:20.809
It is the first time imaginable.
People are on their way home for Christmas.

55:31.724 --> 55:35.418
Laila, we're going now. Laila, we're going now.

55:36.595 --> 55:38.777
Are you coming?

55:38.802 --> 55:43.022
- There's a room 100-200 meters away.
- We can't go any further.

55:43.047 --> 55:46.476
- We can wait for help there.
- We gotta get out!

55:46.501 --> 55:51.903
Listen to me! They're down, breathe
through the shirt and just follow me.

55:55.909 --> 55:58.562
ENABLE SENSORS

56:18.429 --> 56:22.706
Hello Hello.
I'll fix it here. I will fix it.

56:24.756 --> 56:27.602
Yes, I spend all Christmas on it.

56:27.627 --> 56:32.140
The extent and number of people affected
nor can I comment on it.

56:32.164 --> 56:35.567
What are you doing?
What are you up to ?!

56:39.658 --> 56:43.546
Do you understand what is going on?

56:43.571 --> 56:47.500
People are fighting for life.
You and I got away -

56:47.525 --> 56:52.662
- maybe because of an idiot like you.
Don't waste time unlocking your son.

56:52.687 --> 56:58.462
He's alive. You are alive.

57:04.300 --> 57:07.979
... keep your distance. The tunnel is closed
in both directions.

57:08.004 --> 57:12.323
We will return to it when we have
a better picture of what happened. Thanks.

57:17.663 --> 57:24.131
It's burning in the Storfjelltunnel
and a tanker truck is involved.

57:24.156 --> 57:30.556
This is a movie from just before
the fire broke out from someone who came out.

57:39.224 --> 57:43.542
Come on. Respond. Respond.

57:49.172 --> 57:52.061
- Reply.
- Hello.

57:52.086 --> 57:56.223
Stein? Elise is in the tunnel.

57:56.248 --> 57:59.388
She's in the tunnel.

57:59.413 --> 58:02.343
- What the hell in the tunnel?
- I saw a clip on TV.

58:02.368 --> 58:06.671
No one had filmed any inside.
She was standing outside the express bus.

58:06.696 --> 58:10.725
I am one hundred percent looking for
that she was.

58:12.941 --> 58:16.428
She got on the bus to Oslo.

58:40.915 --> 58:42.929
Damn!

58:42.954 --> 58:45.440
Go to the cave

58:49.029 --> 58:53.265
- What's going on? Are we going in?
- Yes.

58:55.107 --> 58:58.178
Elise is in the tunnel.

58:59.645 --> 59:03.284
- Do you take fire blankets and water?
- How many blankets?

59:03.309 --> 59:06.419
- As many as you can carry. Come on.
- Sure.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.971
- What the hell is he up to?
- Elise.

59:22.996 --> 59:26.066
- Elise is in the tunnel.
- Oh, my God.

59:36.942 --> 59:40.288
Hall?
Hi. My name is Elise Berge.

59:40.313 --> 59:43.701
We got off the bus
and on the way to a room in the tunnel.

59:43.726 --> 59:47.405
- What room? Stop in the bus.
- A technology room.

59:47.430 --> 59:51.568
The cave is called it. Can you say hello
Stein Berge that we are in the Cave?

59:51.593 --> 59:57.521
The cave? Who is Stein Berge?
Is he a firefighter?

59:57.546 --> 01:00:01.283
Elise? Hello, when are you there?

01:00:17.901 --> 01:00:19.334
SPEED FLASH

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:23.745
- What are you doing, Ivar?
- I put the fans on max.

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:26.300
Calm, calm, calm.

01:00:27.974 --> 01:00:31.863
- It's not safe for them to endure it.
- Stein's in there now.

01:00:31.887 --> 01:00:36.247
They are made for it. It stays high.
Make a choice, like!

01:00:57.488 --> 01:01:01.056
Come back, Stein. Stein!

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:08.409
Come on!

01:01:08.434 --> 01:01:11.990
- It's a lot of smoke here!
- Yes, but much more out there.

01:01:12.015 --> 01:01:16.832
Now, yes. In a few minutes
so it's just as bad inside.

01:01:17.718 --> 01:01:20.620
Oh my God.

01:01:33.744 --> 01:01:36.273
It's airy. Hr.

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:42.543
Okay but...

01:01:42.568 --> 01:01:46.887
There are more of you who need air.

01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:08.500
Stein? Do you hear me?
Come out again!

01:03:08.525 --> 01:03:09.667
CAVE

01:03:09.692 --> 01:03:13.800
I continue to the engineering room.
I'm in the middle of the tunnel now.

01:03:16.684 --> 01:03:20.613
- Hall�?
- Traffic center ...

01:03:20.638 --> 01:03:25.705
- Hall�? Hello, who is it?
- Can I talk to my mom?

01:03:27.465 --> 01:03:30.270
- Mom.
- Hall�?

01:03:30.295 --> 01:03:36.264
- Hello. Who are you?
- Sara. Don't you find us soon?

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:41.508
Hello Sara. My name is Andrea.
Do you have your parents nearby?

01:03:41.533 --> 01:03:46.629
We can't find them.
It's just a lot of smoke.

01:03:46.654 --> 01:03:51.998
- We can't breathe!
- We? Who are we, Sara?

01:03:52.023 --> 01:03:59.241
- Martine. My little sister.
- Hello. Listen to me now.

01:03:59.266 --> 01:04:04.195
You have to find a car
and go into it. Do you understand?

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.609
- Sara, is there a car?
- She said we have to find a car.

01:04:08.634 --> 01:04:14.603
Yes, any car. Get in
in it and shut the doors directly.

01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:18.888
It is easier to breathe in there.
And don't go out.

01:04:18.913 --> 01:04:22.594
Do you hear me, Sara?
Don't get out of the car.

01:04:22.619 --> 01:04:25.550
Is it long? I can not see anything.

01:04:25.575 --> 01:04:32.252
Sara, I know how it is now.
It's totally okay to be scared.

01:04:32.277 --> 01:04:36.580
I was also a long time ago,
but it went well.

01:04:36.605 --> 01:04:40.964
Just listen to me, okay?
Then it will go well.

01:04:43.181 --> 01:04:48.319
Sara? Are you there? Do you hear me?

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:52.579
- Yes.
- We can go to the postman. Dr.

01:04:53.838 --> 01:04:57.267
Hall? Martine?

01:04:57.292 --> 01:05:02.845
- Who's the "postman"? Sara?
- Martine, wait!

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.024
Brevbrare

01:05:33.508 --> 01:05:36.645
- It's empty.
- Huh?

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:40.948
- It's empty on air.
- Huh?

01:05:42.207 --> 01:05:45.734
- No it...
- Yes.

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:53.671
- I'm going now.
- Huh? Where are you going?

01:05:53.696 --> 01:05:56.584
Wait, I'm coming along.

01:05:56.609 --> 01:06:00.788
- Hall�? Hey!
- Wait, I'm coming! Wait!

01:06:00.813 --> 01:06:03.800
No!

01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:11.987
S� hell!
If you open the door now ...

01:06:12.012 --> 01:06:14.290
Move!

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.593
What's the plan?

01:07:11.493 --> 01:07:14.314
In here!

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.288
Do you think anyone will find us here?

01:07:43.255 --> 01:07:46.075
Dad's coming.

01:07:47.293 --> 01:07:50.598
Have you talked to him?

01:07:50.623 --> 01:07:53.885
How does he know where we are?

01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:57.190
After all, you left without saying anything.

01:08:07.814 --> 01:08:13.824
NRK Day News looks extra
about the fire in the Storfjelltunneln.

01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:18.029
That's great smoke development
and the cows are long.

01:08:18.054 --> 01:08:21.912
According to several sources
the express bus is in the tunnel.

01:08:23.548 --> 01:08:27.477
- Sogndal fire truck is on the way.
- We're ready now.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:31.473
We must wait
until it is safe to enter.

01:08:31.497 --> 01:08:36.649
- Wait? We have to go in now.
- Yeah, we're just waiting for green light.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:44.600
Stein, do you hear me?
Stein? We're not going in, Stein!

01:09:09.002 --> 01:09:14.113
It was your mom who taught me
to swim. Did you know that?

01:09:17.452 --> 01:09:21.174
Do you call it swimming?

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:24.935
I call it dog swimming.

01:09:31.023 --> 01:09:34.051
Are you a racist or are you?

01:09:36.642 --> 01:09:40.420
And you keep a nice memory,
I remember.

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:45.372
Funny and sad.

01:09:47.674 --> 01:09:51.366
I never did.

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:56.571
You don't know that until you've tried.

01:09:57.871 --> 01:10:01.025
I hope you don't.

01:10:11.525 --> 01:10:13.872
Where's Stein?

01:10:13.897 --> 01:10:15.913
He has run in.

01:10:15.938 --> 01:10:18.619
- Even?
- Yes.

01:10:18.644 --> 01:10:22.214
- Did he drive himself?
- Yes.

01:10:25.677 --> 01:10:31.480
- Why are they doing nothing?
- We're moving in now.

01:10:31.504 --> 01:10:35.768
- No no. You're not going in, Ivar.
- You no longer decide.

01:10:35.793 --> 01:10:39.057
I understand you want to go in,
but Sogndal is coming soon.

01:10:39.082 --> 01:10:42.636
- Soon? It's too late.
- You're not going in there.

01:10:42.661 --> 01:10:45.481
- You don't decide.
- You ...

01:10:48.821 --> 01:10:51.767
I just got you, Ivar.

01:10:55.982 --> 01:10:59.011
Sogndal wants to talk to you.

01:11:15.712 --> 01:11:19.364
Martine! Sara!

01:11:21.998 --> 01:11:24.776
Never hear?

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:30.145
Elise!

01:11:40.521 --> 01:11:42.508
Elise!

01:11:43.976 --> 01:11:46.795
Elise!

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:04.361
Elise!

01:12:38.172 --> 01:12:40.410
Elise.

01:12:42.627 --> 01:12:46.430
- Hello.
- Hey Hey hey.

01:12:46.455 --> 01:12:50.012
My girl.

01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:55.437
Okay. Breathe in that hair.
S. Breathe. So yeah.

01:13:01.984 --> 01:13:04.510
Here! Put it on.

01:13:05.312 --> 01:13:07.425
Here!

01:13:10.348 --> 01:13:12.697
Breathe.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:16.943
Findings of five survivors
in the engineering room 5 km into the tunnel.

01:13:16.968 --> 01:13:19.816
Evacuees out west now.

01:13:19.841 --> 01:13:23.826
I hear you, Stein. Elise d�?

01:13:24.793 --> 01:13:28.056
- Did you find Elise?
- Elise is one of them.

01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:30.111
She's alive.

01:13:50.934 --> 01:13:57.278
Five survivors found in the tunnel.
Stein Berge, citizen / firefighter -

01:13:57.303 --> 01:14:01.996
- is the only operative
in the tunnel now.

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:07.434
- Christian, Relief Corps.
- Hi, it's Andrea on VTS.

01:14:07.459 --> 01:14:11.097
Do you have contact
with Stein Berge in the tunnel?

01:14:11.122 --> 01:14:14.900
Yes, I have him on the radio.

01:14:18.449 --> 01:14:20.895
Come on!

01:14:22.653 --> 01:14:26.123
- Stein, right here at the traffic center.
- Stein.

01:14:26.148 --> 01:14:30.787
- Stone? Andrea at the traffic center.
- I'm listening.

01:14:30.811 --> 01:14:33.784
Do you take out two girls? 8-9 years old?

01:14:33.809 --> 01:14:38.279
- G�. - There are no children here.
- Someone called ten minutes ago.

01:14:38.305 --> 01:14:43.398
An emergency phone in the tech room.
At the Grotto. Where you found Elise.

01:14:43.423 --> 01:14:47.978
I told the girls to go
nearest car. They haven't gone that far.

01:14:48.003 --> 01:14:52.682
They are all alone.
Can you do a search?

01:14:52.707 --> 01:14:54.902
Stein?

01:14:57.619 --> 01:15:00.022
Sara and Martine.

01:15:00.866 --> 01:15:03.768
Sara and Martine.

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:21.001
Into the camper van! in!

01:15:25.799 --> 01:15:29.701
- You have to wear the mask.
- It's empty on air.

01:15:32.876 --> 01:15:38.262
- Rafa, can you drive a car? This car?
- Yes.

01:15:38.287 --> 01:15:41.314
Don't you go out?

01:15:42.157 --> 01:15:45.228
Rafa runs out.

01:15:46.862 --> 01:15:50.250
I've paved the road.
Just follow the middle line.

01:15:50.275 --> 01:15:54.538
- But we can wait for you here.
- No. You...

01:15:54.563 --> 01:15:57.633
- You're driving Elise out.
- Okay.

01:15:59.474 --> 01:16:04.278
But I can't lose you now.
Please, don't.

01:16:04.303 --> 01:16:08.121
There are two girls in here.
I can't go out without researching.

01:16:11.253 --> 01:16:13.576
Dad.

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:17.821
I'm getting out of the car.

01:16:18.997 --> 01:16:22.649
You can do it right here. You can do it.

01:16:29.569 --> 01:16:32.001
I had to get the masks back.

01:16:32.026 --> 01:16:35.221
I need your mask!
I need your mask.

01:16:37.104 --> 01:16:39.576
- Give it to me. You will be out soon.
- Dad!

01:16:39.601 --> 01:16:42.281
Rafa!

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:44.628
- K�r.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:16:46.052 --> 01:16:48.082
Dad!

01:17:13.527 --> 01:17:17.054
Rafa? F� out the others, okay?

01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:21.216
What the hell are you doing ?!

01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:24.756
I have to help Dad.

01:17:27.137 --> 01:17:29.527
- Take it here.
- Thanks.

01:17:29.552 --> 01:17:34.495
I'll teach you to swim properly
when we come out. See you out there!

01:17:35.921 --> 01:17:37.244
Now we go!

01:17:58.023 --> 01:18:01.219
Sara! Martine!

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:30.760
Hall? Hall?

01:18:30.785 --> 01:18:35.464
- It's Stein Berge.
- Have you found Sara and Martine?

01:18:35.489 --> 01:18:39.583
I've searched all the cars here.
They aren't here.

01:18:39.608 --> 01:18:42.912
Are you looking?
They can't have gone that far.

01:18:42.937 --> 01:18:48.506
There are not that many opportunities
right now. I have to get out.

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:52.238
Go to the postman ...

01:18:52.263 --> 01:18:57.232
Stein! See a mail truck there?
They would go to the postman, they said.

01:18:57.257 --> 01:19:01.478
There is no mail car here.
I gotta go. I had to go out.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.823
Wait. Stein.

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:11.109
Bring. See a Bring Car?
A green Bring car?

01:19:12.119 --> 01:19:18.726
Stein? Stein? Stein!

01:19:38.091 --> 01:19:40.664
Take it!

01:19:41.339 --> 01:19:43.702
Sara?

01:19:44.877 --> 01:19:48.265
- Martine? Martine?
- You're not going in!

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:51.944
- Watch her.
- They're not there. They aren't here.

01:19:57.198 --> 01:19:59.685
Come, come, come.

01:20:10.769 --> 01:20:13.740
Is it okay?

01:20:13.765 --> 01:20:17.736
I told them to stand there.
I told them to stop.

01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:21.982
They do everything they can to find them.
Okay? They look.

01:20:22.007 --> 01:20:26.035
I told them to stop.

01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:31.848
Have you seen my girls?

01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:35.760
Sleep, Mia, calm down! Get rid of him!

01:20:35.785 --> 01:20:40.130
- Look here.
- I've lost my kids.

01:20:40.155 --> 01:20:43.268
We'll find your children.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.195
Where's Elise?

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.567
Stein walked in
to find two girls.

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:07.022
Elise went after him.

01:21:07.047 --> 01:21:10.242
She went after?

01:21:25.029 --> 01:21:28.557
Sara! Martine!

01:21:51.876 --> 01:21:54.406
Hey!

01:22:01.494 --> 01:22:04.174
Light the door. Come on.

01:22:04.199 --> 01:22:06.478
Come on!

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:27.831
Hi. Are you Sara?
Are you okay? Look here.

01:22:32.379 --> 01:22:35.241
We need oxygen.

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:43.274
I've lost my kids.

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:59.967
Oh my God.

01:23:05.014 --> 01:23:06.876
Dad!

01:23:11.882 --> 01:23:15.659
Okay. Come on.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:29.603
Come, come, come, come.

01:23:46.057 --> 01:23:48.127
Come on.

01:24:24.061 --> 01:24:31.001
At a press conference just said
Transport Minister Reidar Viksen ...

01:24:31.928 --> 01:24:35.400
What's going on?

01:24:35.424 --> 01:24:38.521
We're just waiting.

01:24:38.546 --> 01:24:41.449
Jump in.

01:25:09.599 --> 01:25:12.295
Hi, Mona.

01:25:21.339 --> 01:25:24.768
Dad.

01:25:24.793 --> 01:25:27.555
- G� with mom.
- No, Mom's not here anymore.

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:31.110
It's just me and you.
Mom's dead.

01:25:34.366 --> 01:25:37.478
- You have to take the girls out.
- Dad ...

01:25:39.402 --> 01:25:43.307
- G�.
- No, come on.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:52.838
You can do it.

01:25:54.888 --> 01:26:02.288
- G�.
- Dad, come on. Dad, come on.

01:26:05.544 --> 01:26:07.948
Hall?

01:26:12.454 --> 01:26:16.300
Hall? Snlla.

01:26:16.324 --> 01:26:18.813
There are two little girls here.

01:26:25.691 --> 01:26:27.705
Fire and rescue on the road.

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:34.006
Many people think the road should have
closed today because of the storm.

01:26:36.431 --> 01:26:40.111
- Is there anything out there?
- Elise, do you hear me? Where are you?

01:26:40.136 --> 01:26:43.648
Dad's in here!

01:26:43.673 --> 01:26:50.073
Ivar! - Elise, it's Ingrid.
Do not stay there for years. We are coming in now!

01:26:57.910 --> 01:27:00.730
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:08.512
Ivar?

01:27:09.898 --> 01:27:11.718
Kr!

01:27:13.852 --> 01:27:16.714
Elise, we're coming now.

01:27:23.633 --> 01:27:27.271
Strange fire truck right.
We're getting through the avalanche on the chair.

01:27:27.296 --> 01:27:30.408
We are at the entrance first
in about ten minutes.

01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:39.358
Dad?

01:27:41.826 --> 01:27:44.811
Look. I broke your record.

01:27:47.569 --> 01:27:50.430
You thought you could beat me.

01:27:51.439 --> 01:27:53.261
Dad.

01:27:54.354 --> 01:27:58.174
Elise, press twice
if you hear me!

01:28:17.872 --> 01:28:20.901
I can not see anything.

01:28:27.863 --> 01:28:31.099
Look at the road.

01:28:34.482 --> 01:28:37.468
Oh my God. Shit.

01:28:44.138 --> 01:28:46.652
Stay here.
Whistle and blink every minute.

01:28:46.677 --> 01:28:48.650
- Ivar, I'm going along.
- You work for me.

01:28:48.675 --> 01:28:52.646
So you do as I say.
You're staying here with Ingrid, okay?

01:28:52.671 --> 01:28:55.700
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not working for you!

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:10.144
Elise!

01:29:12.652 --> 01:29:14.889
Elise!

01:29:21.726 --> 01:29:24.088
Elise!

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.478
Elise!

01:30:00.813 --> 01:30:03.132
Ingrid!

01:30:03.976 --> 01:30:07.337
Move is, move is.

01:30:08.305 --> 01:30:13.207
Stein? Stein? Stein? Do you hear me?

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.199
Ivar, the mask. Ivar! He breathes.

01:30:26.411 --> 01:30:28.219
- That's good.
- Mom.

01:30:28.244 --> 01:30:30.592
We had to get out!

01:30:30.617 --> 01:30:34.478
Take a look, take a look!

01:30:39.732 --> 01:30:41.887
G!

01:30:48.557 --> 01:30:52.377
Get away! Hey!

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.529
Dad.

01:31:08.954 --> 01:31:11.108
No! No!

01:31:25.979 --> 01:31:28.091
Dad!

01:31:32.806 --> 01:31:34.877
Dad!

01:31:38.132 --> 01:31:40.287
Dad?

01:31:57.032 --> 01:31:59.519
- Stone!
- Dad?

01:32:04.482 --> 01:32:09.634
Stein? Okay. Okay.

01:32:10.394 --> 01:32:13.130
Lift him.

01:32:14.306 --> 01:32:18.082
Are you okay?
Okay. Up here.

01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:21.330
Where was Ivar?

01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:30.987
Ivar ...? Ivar?

01:32:39.823 --> 01:32:42.211
- Dad.
- Ivar?

01:32:42.236 --> 01:32:46.014
Dad, come on.

01:32:48.564 --> 01:32:52.369
- Dad, come on!
- Stein, we have to get out now!

01:32:52.394 --> 01:32:55.172
Come on now!

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:18.648
INFART �ST

01:33:36.933 --> 01:33:40.030
The road is there even if you don't see it.

01:33:40.055 --> 01:33:45.040
Keep focus and smooth speed.
Otherwise, you get stuck.

01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:18.923
No one is calling anymore.

01:34:25.094 --> 01:34:28.066
- I was so scared.
- It's fine with us.

01:34:28.091 --> 01:34:32.977
- We're not inside the tunnel.
- It's on the news all the time.

01:34:33.002 --> 01:34:38.280
We didn't come that far. I dared
Don't drive over the mountain in the storm.

01:34:39.663 --> 01:34:43.385
No one lights his lamp
and puts its door on it.

01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:48.269
All the hearts and doors of us
Bethlehem is holding tight.

01:36:05.371 --> 01:36:09.023
There is someone who wants to talk to you.

01:36:11.033 --> 01:36:16.126
- Stone.
- Hi, Stein. Did you get the girls out?

01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:19.179
Wait a bit.

01:36:29.845 --> 01:36:32.167
Hi.

01:36:35.383 --> 01:36:39.535
It is someone who is very happy
want to talk to you.

01:36:44.082 --> 01:36:46.736
Sara, is that you?

01:36:51.949 --> 01:36:55.768
Yes, it was good to hear. Yes Yes.

01:38:13.786 --> 01:38:16.189
Come on.

01:38:18.156 --> 01:38:20.894
Dad. Come on.

01:39:18.975 --> 01:39:23.121
THE END
