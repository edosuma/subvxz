WEBVTT

00:20.454 --> 00:22.256
(knocking)

00:22.290 --> 00:24.325
Avery Ryan?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.426
Yes?

00:25.459 --> 00:27.128
I'm Jessica Turing.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.830
I believe you and I are

00:29.863 --> 00:32.066
in love with the same man.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.303
Uh...

00:37.271 --> 00:40.274
Jessica...

00:40.308 --> 00:42.576
Andrew is deeply devoted to you.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.312
Normally I wouldn't
doubt that,

00:44.345 --> 00:45.479
but things have changed

00:45.513 --> 00:47.315
since Andrew's visit here
a few weeks ago.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.616
He's working late a lot.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.750
Isn't interested
in discussing

00:49.783 --> 00:52.453
the final details
of our wedding.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.455
I've noticed
the two of you talk

00:54.488 --> 00:56.590
more than you ever have
over text and e-mail.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.459
I realize he's

00:58.492 --> 01:00.128
your ex-husband, but I thought
you had both moved on.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.495
I'm sure that Andrew

01:01.529 --> 01:04.098
shared with you that he's been
the victim of a hack.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.135
That someone filed a false
death certificate in his name.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.470
And it takes a lot
of work to clear that up.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.339
You know that he's
our main witness

01:11.372 --> 01:13.341
in this case
against this hacker?

01:13.374 --> 01:16.877
How convenient for you.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.380
I'm not sure I like what
you're implying with that...

01:19.413 --> 01:20.614
Then I'll be more direct.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.384
I love Andrew and I want you
to stop communicating with him.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.819
I imagine there are plenty
of people on your staff

01:25.853 --> 01:29.223
qualified to handle
any business regarding the hack.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.259
I'm gonna marry him, Avery.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.662
Please don't get in the way.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.730
I'll see myself out.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.135
(phone rings)

01:44.705 --> 01:47.541
Avery Ryan.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.145
So that means
somebody must've

01:51.179 --> 01:53.381
compromised
the government servers.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.416
I'll be there
in a half an hour.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.488
The NSA, CIA,
Homeland Security,

02:00.521 --> 02:02.456
Department of Defense
and the FBI.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.258
Each of us were sent e-mails

02:04.292 --> 02:05.859
explaining the Federal
Government Office

02:05.893 --> 02:08.562
of Personnel Management
has been hacked.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.564
Gentlemen, there's still a
possibility that this is a hoax.

02:10.598 --> 02:11.865
MAN: We can assure
you it's not.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.601
The hackers sent proof.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.336
Attached to each e-mail is a PDF

02:15.369 --> 02:17.738
of our own SF-86 file

02:17.771 --> 02:19.773
with every personal detail
included.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.542
This is the document
that government employees

02:21.575 --> 02:24.445
fill out when applying
for top secret clearance.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.946
The form contains health
and financial records.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.549
Details on drug use,
sexual preference,

02:28.582 --> 02:29.883
psychological issues.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.353
Information on friends,
spouses and family members.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.188
MAN 2:
Which is a particular
concern to the CIA.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.889
That's all anybody
needs to impersonate

02:35.923 --> 02:39.293
or blackmail any
of my agents in the field.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.594
MAN 3:
President's concerned
that additional government

02:40.628 --> 02:42.430
documents have been compromised.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.465
And servers also house files,

02:44.498 --> 02:48.402
such as Social Security numbers,
fingerprints and credentials

02:48.436 --> 02:50.704
of over 21 million
federal employees.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.806
In which case, our entire
government is vulnerable.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.942
MAN 2:
How long until you know
the extent of the hack?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.610
Or even who's behind it?

02:56.644 --> 02:57.711
No threats or demands
have been made.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.979
No individual or group

02:59.012 --> 03:01.382
has come forward
claiming responsibility.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.451
Until we know
what devices were used,

03:03.484 --> 03:04.885
the point of intrusion,

03:04.918 --> 03:06.454
the motive,
all that I can tell you

03:06.487 --> 03:09.723
is our target is
incredibly smart and tenacious.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.325
We've instructed
intelligence to review

03:11.359 --> 03:12.560
any cyber chatter
they've detected

03:12.593 --> 03:14.695
over the past few months
from the usual suspects.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.764
China, Russia,
North Korea,

03:16.797 --> 03:18.466
Iran.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.234
As Head of Homeland Security,
I recommend that we proceed

03:20.268 --> 03:21.835
with the belief that the hackers
breached the entire system.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.904
RYAN:
We'll need to notify
all other agencies.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.474
Immediately disconnect
from the OPM servers,

03:26.507 --> 03:29.009
so no further theft
or damage can occur.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.345
I will have my team
start working on patching

03:31.379 --> 03:33.647
its vulnerability
and tracking down this target.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.649
Homeland Security can assist
in any way that you need.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.751
Director,
we've got this covered.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.321
Do know that the Department
of Defense is on alert.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.656
If any of our foreign
adversaries are involved,

03:42.690 --> 03:44.925
Congress will consider
their actions an act of war.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.668
Guys?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.904
Two hours ago,

03:56.937 --> 03:59.273
the U.S. government was hacked.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.775
Wh-Where's Elijah?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.277
I don't know.
I'll text him.
No, I got it.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.912
You get everybody else in here

04:04.945 --> 04:06.980
whoever's not already here.
Yeah.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.416
Got to take
a rain check on tonight.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.450
Text you later?

04:09.483 --> 04:10.484
Yeah.
Okay.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.920
Where you going?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.322
It's my last day

04:14.355 --> 04:15.923
since the hacker for
hire program is over.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.658
Nelson's decided to stay.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.059
He even has plans
for Quantico.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.595
But I don't have that option.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.631
Until the judge hands
down my sentence...

04:23.664 --> 04:26.033
No, you're staying here.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.035
Look, I don't have
the authority to-to do this,

04:28.068 --> 04:31.705
but I don't want you going
anywhere until I tell you to.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.707
We need you here, okay?

04:33.741 --> 04:34.742
Now, go.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.976
Get back to work.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.086
(groans)

04:46.119 --> 04:47.388
Yeah, I got it.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.389
(grunts)

04:48.422 --> 04:49.390
(phone buzzing)

04:49.423 --> 04:51.024
You should get that.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.693
It was buzzing in the car.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.628
They can leave a message.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.798
Listen, Dad, this
whole mess with Nina?

04:57.831 --> 05:01.068
It's my problem,
not yours.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.704
Are you telling
me to butt out?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.506
Yeah.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.475
(laughs)

05:07.508 --> 05:10.378
Come on, showing up
at her bar to confront her?

05:10.411 --> 05:11.712
Eh...
What were you thinking?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.080
(laughs)

05:15.148 --> 05:18.719
And promise me you will show up
to your chemo treatments,

05:18.752 --> 05:21.489
so you don't end up
back in the hospital.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.727
I'm not gonna live much longer.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.061
You know that.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.830
Dad, come-- look, come on.
(stammers)

05:29.863 --> 05:32.600
It's true.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.103
Uh...

05:42.876 --> 05:44.712
I love you, son.

05:44.745 --> 05:48.482
You make me very proud.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.950
Ah...
Dad, please.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.852
Sounds like you got to go.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.822
Yeah.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.357
Come here.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.568
(sniffles)

06:08.969 --> 06:11.405
(sighs)

06:47.475 --> 06:48.642
KRUMITZ:
Okay, here we go.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.078
All the e-mails were sent
from the same e-mail accounts.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.681
And... this IP address
looks legit.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.815
All right, no proxies?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.049
No evidence of spoofing?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.685
No, it didn't even
scrub the e-mail headers.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.152
Not a very sophisticated hack.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.220
Yeah, but our target
had to be somebody

07:00.253 --> 07:01.855
skilled enough to know how

07:01.889 --> 07:03.957
to evade intrusion detection
to break into the OPM.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.859
Then why would they
leave a digital trail

07:05.893 --> 07:07.628
that is so easy to track?

07:07.661 --> 07:08.862
RUSSELL:
Their mistake.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.963
Let's take advantage of it.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.465
Can you get a name and address

07:11.499 --> 07:12.466
from the service provider?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.534
Sure can.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.535
(mumbles)

07:14.568 --> 07:15.803
Here you go.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.038
Arlington, Virginia.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.607
Call them, tell them
to meet Krumitz in tactical.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.642
All right.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.145
Daniel?

07:25.178 --> 07:26.246
You're Krumitz, come on!

07:26.279 --> 07:29.149
Oh, right.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.026
Gentlemen,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.828
the e-mail that each
of you received

07:40.861 --> 07:42.062
came from a device in the home

07:42.095 --> 07:45.098
of Robert and Margo Hazelton.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.600
NELSON:
Margo Hazelton
is a Chinese national.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.735
Husband is

07:47.768 --> 07:50.003
an engineer who frequently
travels to China for work.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.071
I hacked the target's
e-mail accounts.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.973
Same ones
that sent the PDFs.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.742
I discovered over 150 messages

07:54.775 --> 07:58.078
offering a lot of money
for the OPM files.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.047
RUSSELL:
The Hazeltons are looking
to sell the information.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.516
In the wrong hands...
National security nightmare.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.552
This is Snowden all over again.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.853
(door slams open)
FBI!

08:05.886 --> 08:07.154
What the hell is this!?
Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

08:07.187 --> 08:09.189
On your knees!
On your knees!
You can't break into my house!

08:09.222 --> 08:12.125
Robert, why are they here?
We haven't done anything wrong!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.127
Look, can you just tell us
what this is about?!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.029
What are you looking for?!
Are there any other
computers in the house?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.798
Uh (stammers)
our son's room!

08:17.831 --> 08:19.199
Uh, Jake, upstairs.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.601
Look, he's only 13.
Let me go with you...

08:20.634 --> 08:21.835
Stay where you are!

08:21.869 --> 08:23.170
Our daughter's upstairs, please!

08:23.203 --> 08:25.606
Please, you'll scare her!
I want to call
a lawyer right now!

08:27.107 --> 08:28.275
Computer's clean.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.777
Jake!
Emma!

08:29.810 --> 08:32.279
(yells in Chinese)

08:35.315 --> 08:38.552
Oh, that's genius!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.655
It's mineral oil.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.691
Jake's who we're after.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.058
What?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.159
Yeah.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.897
See, the hard drive's missing
from this computer.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.098
Jake hacked the OPM.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.800
You're telling me
U.S. government secrets

08:52.833 --> 08:54.768
are in the hands of
a 13-year-old kid?

08:54.802 --> 08:55.969
Yeah.

09:00.273 --> 09:06.647
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

09:08.381 --> 09:14.855
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

09:14.888 --> 09:18.125
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:18.158 --> 09:22.162
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:22.195 --> 09:26.233
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:26.266 --> 09:30.037
* And miles...

09:30.070 --> 09:32.806
* Oh, yeah.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.752
(heavy pounding)

09:58.932 --> 10:00.300
Are you Wizard?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.869
Achilles?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.372
(chuckles)
The movie Troy, right?

10:05.405 --> 10:08.676
Yeah, just thought it was cool.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.977
(laughs)

10:10.010 --> 10:11.144
You bring the hard drive?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.180
Yeah.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.347
Oh, that's just Echo.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.382
It's all good.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.650
He's a friend.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.286
Come on, show
me what you got!

10:25.225 --> 10:27.394
MUNDO: Oil trail leads to
the garage and out the driveway,

10:27.427 --> 10:28.796
and the kid's bike
is missing.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.030
So we can rule out
a kidnapping.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.198
Locals put out a BOLO.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.633
I'm thinking he's got a buyer
for this hard drive already.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.937
(phone buzzes)

10:36.970 --> 10:39.039
CTOC?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.110
No. Um...

10:43.143 --> 10:44.778
Krumitz, tell me about Jake.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.714
What can help us find him?
This kid's brilliant.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.015
Right. At something
other than hacking?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.216
'Cause he led us right to him.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.350
Yeah, I can't really
figure that part out.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.186
But this kid is
really, really smart.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.456
This computer's processor
and RAM overclocked.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.792
Means it operates at a higher
clock speed and voltage

10:58.826 --> 10:59.993
than the manufacturer
planned.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.161
But that can cause
the computer to overheat

11:01.194 --> 11:02.362
and you'll fry the components.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.265
So Jake built this cooling
system inside this fish tank,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.267
filled it up with mineral oil

11:07.300 --> 11:08.301
because it doesn't
conduct electricity.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.436
13 years old.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.270
I mean, that is knowledge.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.305
Krumitz, I appreciate
your admiration,

11:12.339 --> 11:15.108
but this genius is out there
selling top security secrets.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.177
We need to find him.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.179
Yeah, I see myself in Jake.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.048
Okay.
No, what I mean is,

11:21.081 --> 11:23.250
I didn't have just one computer.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.853
I built others and
I backed up my hard drive.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.289
So let's take a look
at the home network,

11:29.322 --> 11:31.324
see what other devices
are connected.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.327
We confiscated
the mom's tablet

11:34.361 --> 11:35.829
and the dad's laptop,

11:35.863 --> 11:38.031
but the... what is this
other device there? JBC?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.067
JBC...

11:40.100 --> 11:41.334
Jake's backup computer.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.335
There's a backup drive.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.871
It's gotta be here.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.338
We can find it
using an app

11:45.372 --> 11:47.808
that makes
wireless signals visual.

11:47.841 --> 11:48.876
Come on.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.916
No...

12:08.428 --> 12:09.429
I got it!

12:23.543 --> 12:25.278
GARDNER: Do they know
where their son is?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.880
RYAN: No idea.
Jake's cell phone's off.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.049
They gave me the number
of some of his friends.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.550
I'll make some calls.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.252
But Jake's parents
are scared and worried.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.353
They don't know
any more than we do.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.387
And you believe them?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.389
Yes, I do.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.858
(laughs)

12:37.891 --> 12:39.392
Are you aware that the Hazeltons

12:39.426 --> 12:40.961
hosted a Chinese
foreign exchange student

12:40.994 --> 12:42.362
for two years?

12:42.395 --> 12:43.363
A student that returned
to his country

12:43.396 --> 12:44.531
and subsequently was arrested?

12:44.564 --> 12:45.532
I think the Hazeltons

12:45.565 --> 12:46.566
are very generous people.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.836
And for the record,
that student was arrested

12:48.869 --> 12:51.972
for leading
a pro-democracy demonstration.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.074
Jake Hazelton's a 13-year-old
domestic terrorist.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.309
How can you be sure that
the parents aren't involved?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.812
I was told the mother screamed
the children's names

12:58.846 --> 13:00.113
when the SWAT team
moved upstairs.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.114
That was her warning.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.215
That's when Jake knew
to grab that hard drive

13:02.249 --> 13:04.351
and get out of the house.
Well, then what happened?

13:04.384 --> 13:07.855
He slipped past
our well-trained SWAT team

13:07.888 --> 13:10.057
that was surrounding
the house?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.424
Clearly, Jake was not there
when we arrived.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.827
That doesn't rule out
the parents' involvement.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.196
It's okay. I rule out
the parents' involvement.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.197
Under whose authority?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.903
What is your issue,
Director Gardner?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.505
It was your Cyber Division,
Agent Ryan,

13:25.538 --> 13:27.174
that recommended
the course of action

13:27.207 --> 13:28.541
to prevent this kind of breach,

13:28.575 --> 13:30.177
and it clearly failed!

13:30.210 --> 13:31.945
And now you
seem to want

13:31.979 --> 13:33.947
to operate here
with a great deal of autonomy.

13:33.981 --> 13:38.085
First of all, the Cyber Division
recommended protection updates

13:38.118 --> 13:40.287
that were denied because of
budgetary restrictions.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.322
Secondly, hackers
are innovative.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.591
They always find a way.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.994
I earned my autonomy.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.628
It is not "Agent Ryan,"

13:48.661 --> 13:51.131
it is "Deputy Director Ryan."

13:51.164 --> 13:53.033
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:53.066 --> 13:56.870
I have a 13-year-old national
security threat to find.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.356
Hey, Emma.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.590
Hi.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.426
My name's D.B. Russell.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.894
I want to ask you
a few...

14:21.929 --> 14:23.063
Boy, that...

14:23.096 --> 14:24.464
Does that hurt?

14:24.497 --> 14:25.565
What?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.600
Well, it looks like
you've got a...

14:27.634 --> 14:29.069
Excuse me.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.070
That's crazy.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.238
You got a...

14:32.505 --> 14:34.607
Have you seen this trick before?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.076
Yeah.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.344
Okay. (chuckles)

14:37.377 --> 14:40.213
I used to be better at it.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.949
Hey.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.616
You're worried about
your parents, aren't you?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.587
Don't be. They're gonna be fine.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.922
They're just helping us out.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.058
What about Jake?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.626
Well, we're looking
for Jake, actually.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.128
Do you know where he is?

14:55.162 --> 14:56.196
No.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.230
Okay.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.532
Maybe he hurt him.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.468
Who hurt Jake?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.437
Who you talking about, Emma?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.539
The Wizard.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.012
RAMIREZ:
The back-up drive confirms
that Jake is responsible

15:12.045 --> 15:13.646
for the OPM hack.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.148
I'm on the OPM site right now.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.449
That vulnerability has
already been patched.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.517
Wait a minute,
we just recovered the code.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.618
How's that possible?

15:18.651 --> 15:19.619
Jake must've patched it.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.487
Why would he do that?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.155
Because he's a white hat.

15:22.189 --> 15:22.990
Not quite, Krummy.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.958
He did run off
with the hard drive.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.460
That sounds a little gray to me.
Yeah, I'm with Raven.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.429
Jake reached out to a lot
of people about the breach.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.731
Check out
this hacker forum.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.200
See, this is how
it all starts.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.567
You execute your
first big hack,

15:34.601 --> 15:36.203
you start bragging
about it...

15:36.236 --> 15:37.637
and nobody believes
you actually did it.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.639
And then you gotta prove it.
I mean, you can either

15:39.672 --> 15:41.208
share the code
or sell the exploit

15:41.241 --> 15:42.575
and you got everybody on
the forums taking about it,

15:42.609 --> 15:44.044
calling you a genius,

15:44.077 --> 15:45.078
and by that time,
you're in.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.246
You're hooked.
Black hat.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.715
You know, we don't all have
to cross to the dark side.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.117
Okay.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.751
All right. Here we go.
White hat theology.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.753
My experience
isn't just textbooks

15:53.786 --> 15:55.088
and computer
science classes.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.489
I was just like the both of you.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.757
I was curious. Bored.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.192
You know,
when I was 13 years old,

15:59.226 --> 16:00.593
I started messing
around online,

16:00.627 --> 16:02.595
and one day I found myself
inside a bank's network.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.098
Right there.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.200
All the money
I could possibly ever want

16:07.234 --> 16:08.601
right in front of my face.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.371
You didn't take anything?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.572
Nothing.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.742
I was satisfied
by the thrill

16:15.775 --> 16:17.177
of getting behind the site.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.411
You do realize
that's called hacking, right?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.447
I mean, it... it is a crime.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.015
It's what you do afterwards

16:22.049 --> 16:23.316
that makes all the difference.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.153
Jake patched the vulnerability
on the OPM's site.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.720
That's why it was so easy for us

16:27.754 --> 16:30.090
to trace the hack and the
e-mails back to his computer.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.524
He thought he was fixing
the problem.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.160
We're the ones
who decided he was a criminal.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.494
Krumitz, the kid was sending

16:34.527 --> 16:36.196
threatening messages
to the government.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.098
No, he sent proof that
he did it to the government

16:38.131 --> 16:39.599
so they would know
the system was vulnerable.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.201
The intrusion
was patched

16:41.234 --> 16:42.269
after the e-mails were sent.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.072
Jake got no response,
so he just did it himself.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.073
Or he did it to make

16:46.106 --> 16:47.274
his drive more valuable.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.608
He'd get a lot of money.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.709
He's on the run, Krummy.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.178
No, he's scared.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.445
Wouldn't you be?

16:52.479 --> 16:53.580
RUSSELL:
Hey, guys,

16:53.613 --> 16:56.316
anything on that drive about
someone named "the Wizard"?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.784
Yeah, I did see that handle.

16:57.817 --> 16:58.818
Actually, there
was one message

16:58.851 --> 17:00.387
from a Wizard715, and he says,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.155
"You're getting
lots of attention.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.523
Let's take this conversation
offline."

17:03.556 --> 17:05.425
That means there's a chance

17:05.458 --> 17:06.693
that Jake had conversations

17:06.726 --> 17:09.429
with this Wizard in a...
in a private forum.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.331
Is there any way,
anything we can do,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.399
to identify him?

17:12.432 --> 17:13.366
On a private hacker's forum,

17:13.400 --> 17:14.567
activity's
untraceable.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.769
They use spoofed addresses
or the site is usually hosted

17:16.803 --> 17:18.205
on a computer in
another country.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.440
What about legacy footprints?

17:20.473 --> 17:21.208
That might work.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.276
Guys. Sharing?

17:23.310 --> 17:24.677
Digital evidence
that you leave behind

17:24.711 --> 17:25.812
on the Internet
and forget about.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.314
Digital exhaust.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.381
KRUMITZ:
Somewhere on the Internet,

17:28.415 --> 17:29.449
the Wizard may have
used that handle

17:29.482 --> 17:30.950
without anonymizing himself.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.486
Yeah, it's like a burglar
wiping his fingerprints
from a crime scene,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.322
but then forgetting to wipe 'em
off the doorknob when he leaves.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.424
Thank you. Now you're
speaking my language.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.391
Locard's Principle.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.327
Every contact
leaves trace...

17:40.360 --> 17:41.328
even online.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.795
Now, do me a favor. Get...

17:44.764 --> 17:47.167
Um...

17:47.200 --> 17:48.301
Do that legacy thing.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.637
Quickly. Please. Thanks.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.306
You're on a plane tonight?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.742
The red-eye.
I know it's unexpected.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.411
But I got a call and
they need me to start tomorrow.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.846
Greer, I...

17:59.879 --> 18:01.748
I wasn't kidding
when I asked you to join me.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.852
A plane ticket?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.687
You didn't strike me
as the e-ticket type.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.722
Come to Paris
with me, D.B.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.724
Greer, I...
Stop saying my name.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.693
In fact, don't say
anything more.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.730
If you're there at the airport
tonight, great.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.568
If you're not... I get it.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.205
I just don't know how else to
tell you how I feel about you.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.476
You're blushing.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.211
Is that what this is?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.280
Mm-hmm.

18:34.647 --> 18:38.451
I also sent you
a boarding pass in a text.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.452
(knocking at door)

18:39.486 --> 18:40.887
D.B., we found
a legacy footprint.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.889
Someone with the email address
Wizard715@fasttapsmail.com

18:42.922 --> 18:46.326
listed a phone number
on Craigslist

18:46.359 --> 18:47.594
posted three years ago.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.329
We got a location
on the cell phone.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.930
Um, get Elijah
on the phone.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.299
I'll be right there.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.833
I'm so sorry.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.905
Go.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.885
(labored breathing)

19:16.223 --> 19:17.790
MUNDO:
Call 911!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.526
Do you have the hard drive?

19:19.559 --> 19:20.793
Achilles has it.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.262
Jake? Achilles is Jake?

19:22.295 --> 19:23.396
Where is he?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.432
You have to save him.
He ran off with the hard drive.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.834
Echo went after him.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.302
And he'll kill him for it.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.618
MUNDO:
Gerald Fenwick, aka Wizard,
died in surgery.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.653
Traces of blood and skin
found underneath his fingernails

19:46.686 --> 19:49.889
were a DNA match in CODIS
to Jeffrey Stevens,

19:49.922 --> 19:52.225
aka Echo.
We found Jake's bike at the gym,

19:52.259 --> 19:54.394
and his fingerprints
also place him at the scene.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.396
Fingerprints.
Jake had priors?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.365
No, his parents
volunteered his toothbrush

19:58.398 --> 19:59.766
and we lifted partials
that were a match

19:59.799 --> 20:01.501
to what we pulled at the scene.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.669
And where do we think
Jake is now?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.770
MUNDO:
He's on the run.

20:03.803 --> 20:04.904
Not from us, but from Echo,

20:04.937 --> 20:06.373
who will not hesitate

20:06.406 --> 20:07.807
to kill Jake for
that hard drive.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.908
It's possible
Jake was working with Echo

20:08.941 --> 20:09.942
and Wizard got in the way.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.678
That's an unlikely scenario .

20:11.711 --> 20:13.012
There's been no
prior communication

20:13.045 --> 20:14.281
between Jake and Echo,

20:14.314 --> 20:15.482
either on e-mail or on forums.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.285
Foreign intelligence chatter
just revealed that earlier today

20:18.318 --> 20:20.520
somebody brokered a deal to sell
the OPM documents to Russia.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.954
MUNDO:
All right. Well,
we recovered Wizard's laptop.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.656
Hopefully, it'll provide
the answer to that question

20:23.690 --> 20:25.258
and where Jake is headed.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.997
Something happened at that gym
that Wizard was not expecting.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.532
Besides getting shot?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.000
You know,
a 13-year-old doesn't go

20:34.033 --> 20:36.303
to meet a stranger
in an abandoned building

20:36.336 --> 20:37.437
if they don't feel safe.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.272
There were no
signs of struggle

20:39.306 --> 20:41.274
between Wizard and Jake
at the scene.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.809
You know what
I'm thinking?

20:42.842 --> 20:45.678
Wizard had a plan
and Echo had another.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.353
WIZARD:
Wow. (laughs)

20:53.386 --> 20:54.421
Wow, this... this is it!

20:54.454 --> 20:55.822
This is everything
from the OPM.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.956
You did it, kid!

20:56.989 --> 20:58.691
You really did it.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.293
JAKE:
Didn't mean to.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.193
It just kind of happened.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.995
I sent an e-mail explaining
what happened,

21:03.029 --> 21:04.864
but nobody wrote back.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.467
It's good that you reached
out to the community.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.068
How much do you think
we can get for the hard drive?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.069
(chuckles):
What?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.871
This is serious stuff, man.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.474
We gotta give this to the FBI,
so the kid

21:14.507 --> 21:15.475
can be a genius

21:15.508 --> 21:16.976
and a hero.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.645
No.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.847
(chuckles)
What do you mean, no?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.950
I mean no.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.385
Run, Achilles!

21:31.891 --> 21:34.861
(groaning)

21:34.894 --> 21:36.363
(panting)

21:37.930 --> 21:40.333
(sighs)

21:43.436 --> 21:44.537
I can't access
Wizard's laptop.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.072
What?

21:46.105 --> 21:48.341
Thought you said
that Tableau 3

21:48.375 --> 21:49.576
could crack any code.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.778
Wizard doesn't have his name
for nothing.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.613
He likes bells and whistles.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.948
His laptop is equipped
with a biometric lock

21:55.982 --> 21:57.917
and liveness detection.

21:57.950 --> 21:58.985
Meaning we need his fingerprint.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.020
Yeah, but not just his print--
we need him alive.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.054
The print has to be alive.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.756
The scanner
on Wizard's laptop

22:03.790 --> 22:04.824
considers three things.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.494
One, that the fingerprint
being scanned is a match

22:07.527 --> 22:08.595
to the device's owner.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.662
Two, that it's human skin.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.997
And three, an active pulse.

22:11.030 --> 22:11.964
Meaning without Wizard,

22:11.998 --> 22:13.900
we can't unlock the laptop.
Okay, all right,

22:13.933 --> 22:15.802
so that means we need to
bring him back to life, right?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.905
Bring his laptop. Let's go.

22:18.938 --> 22:19.839
What?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.341
How is he gonna bring him
back to life?

22:23.410 --> 22:25.912
I have no idea.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.705
Did you do this a lot
at your old job?

22:52.739 --> 22:53.706
This,

22:53.740 --> 22:55.908
and many things

22:55.942 --> 22:57.444
far more gruesome, actually.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.078
Let's hope that, uh,

22:59.111 --> 23:00.947
Wizard here was right-handed,

23:00.980 --> 23:02.915
or I'm gonna have to start
all over again.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.016
You sure that's gonna work?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.785
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.720
We need his fingerprint,

23:07.754 --> 23:11.023
and Raven's
only requirements were

23:11.057 --> 23:13.460
that it be human skin--

23:13.493 --> 23:14.494
which this is--

23:14.527 --> 23:15.962
and an active pulse.

23:15.995 --> 23:16.896
Yeah, but it's not alive.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.598
I know, I know, but

23:18.631 --> 23:22.068
the scanner here determines life
based on blood flow

23:22.101 --> 23:24.103
and, uh,
fluctuations in life

23:24.136 --> 23:25.805
underneath the skin

23:25.838 --> 23:27.807
created by a pulse,

23:27.840 --> 23:31.010
and I, D.B. Russell,
am alive and have a pulse.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.779
Shall we do this?
Let's do it.

23:32.812 --> 23:33.780
Oh, I hope this works.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.814
All right.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.816
No match.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.651
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.019
I'm guessing Wizard
is a thumb man.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.187
Try his thumb.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.459
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.127
Look at that.
(chuckles)

23:48.160 --> 23:49.228
Look at that.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.897
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.040
(sighs)

24:03.009 --> 24:05.077
Oh, my God, I love this one,

24:05.111 --> 24:07.547
but do you think it's gonna
be enough for 120 people?

24:07.580 --> 24:09.816
Really?

24:09.849 --> 24:11.484
Hey.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.720
RYAN:
Andrew, um...

24:13.753 --> 24:16.556
(sighs)
This is never gonna be easy.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.927
(sighs) Jessica came to see me.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.496
It doesn't, it doesn't matter,

24:23.530 --> 24:24.997
but what does matter

24:25.031 --> 24:26.699
is that she is right.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.168
We can't be friends.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.572
I don't, I don't understand.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.041
I want to be more than friends.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.744
And I know that I didn't fight
for our marriage

24:37.777 --> 24:38.978
when Hannah died,

24:39.011 --> 24:42.148
and I know I let you walk out
of my life three weeks ago,

24:42.181 --> 24:44.283
when I should have been saying
all of this.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.918
And I know this is wrong

24:45.952 --> 24:48.621
to be doing this over the phone

24:48.655 --> 24:51.057
in the middle of a really,
really stressful day.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.859
I mean...

24:52.892 --> 24:55.562
(sighs) I mean, me.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.996
I-I'm...

24:57.029 --> 24:58.998
having a really stressful day.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.668
But, Andrew,

25:01.701 --> 25:03.570
this is right.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.839
We are right.

25:08.307 --> 25:11.210
(chuckles)

25:11.243 --> 25:13.245
I want to try again.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.585
I want you back.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.620
Chocolate or carrot cake?

25:20.653 --> 25:21.688
(sighs)

25:21.721 --> 25:23.590
Chocolate.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.957
What?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.092
Uh...

25:26.125 --> 25:27.226
Uh, Avery, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.695
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.830
(sighs)

25:30.863 --> 25:32.832
Uh, sure.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.300
(sighs)

25:36.035 --> 25:38.270
(sighs)

25:40.773 --> 25:42.308
(chuckles)

25:42.341 --> 25:43.943
(sighing)

25:55.354 --> 25:56.923
(Krumitz sighs)

25:56.956 --> 25:58.991
Elijah.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.895
I recovered
the private messages

26:02.929 --> 26:04.831
between Jake and Wizard
from Wizard's laptop.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.098
Jake doesn't know
Wizard's dead.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.134
Okay, how's that important?

26:08.167 --> 26:09.736
Because Jake is still
communicating with Wizard,

26:09.769 --> 26:11.037
or whoever
he thinks Wizard is,

26:11.070 --> 26:12.271
and he's actually
getting messages back.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.873
Echo.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.274
He stole Wizard's phone--
he's pretending to be him.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.643
Yeah, they've set up
a meeting time

26:16.676 --> 26:18.077
to exchange the hard drive,

26:18.110 --> 26:19.879
4:00 p.m.
Where?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.347
That's the problem--
I don't know where.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.749
The message just says,

26:22.782 --> 26:24.851
"meet where Wizard spent
his summers as a kid."

26:24.884 --> 26:26.018
That's it, that's all I got.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.186
All right.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.587
We got 45 minutes
to figure that out.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.898
Just got a hit on the BOLO.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.633
Jake Hazelton was spotted
at an Internet café

26:40.667 --> 26:42.201
in Adams Morgan.
That's about 20 minutes away.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.102
Is he still there?

26:43.135 --> 26:44.403
MUNDO: I don't think so.
Raven's pulling up

26:44.436 --> 26:45.905
the surveillance footage now.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.406
RAMIREZ: Screen one,
that's Jake in the café

26:47.439 --> 26:48.340
at 3:04 p.m.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.710
Can we get closer to see
who he's texting?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.311
No, I tried that, but
the picture gets grainy.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.345
My guess is
it's the fake Wizard,

26:53.379 --> 26:54.847
Echo.
NELSON: Well,
we tried calling his phone,

26:54.881 --> 26:56.182
but we can see from the footage

26:56.215 --> 26:57.349
he's got it in airplane mode.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.218
I mean, he doesn't
want anyone to find him.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.854
Yeah, it means he's using hot
spots to communicate via Wi-Fi.

27:01.888 --> 27:02.922
But we can't track
or reach him

27:02.955 --> 27:05.424
unless we know the Wi-Fi network
he's signed on to.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.893
There's gotta be some way
to warn him

27:06.926 --> 27:08.194
that the man he's about to meet

27:08.227 --> 27:09.896
is not Wizard, but Echo.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.163
Well, maybe we can use
the surveillance footage

27:11.197 --> 27:12.198
to determine
the meet location.

27:12.231 --> 27:15.101
All right, Jake left the café
at around 3:00.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.769
He's on foot,
he's no longer on his bike.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.304
Chances are he's not gonna take
public transportation.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.371
That's too risky.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.173
Okay, so let's do
a little geographic profiling.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.309
On foot, Jake could, what?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.044
Travel a radius

27:25.077 --> 27:26.746
about three miles.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.247
So use the café
as the epicenter.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.281
All right.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.785
(sighs) Nice try, D.B.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.053
But, uh, it's not
getting us anything.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.322
Do we know where Wizard
spent his summers?

27:36.355 --> 27:37.824
Did we get anything
off of his devices?

27:37.857 --> 27:39.091
Nothing.
RAMIREZ:
Wait a minute,

27:39.125 --> 27:41.427
there might be one way
we could find Jake,

27:41.460 --> 27:43.796
but we'd have to force
Jake's phone onto a network.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.197
KRUMITZ: Okay, okay, I like
where you're going with that.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.934
That might work, but the phone
will only connect

27:47.967 --> 27:49.035
to a Wi-Fi network
it already trusts.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.202
Wait a minute, are you guys
talking about forcing

27:50.236 --> 27:52.471
the phone to connect to Wi-Fi?

27:52.504 --> 27:55.174
His phone can connect, even
though it's in airplane mode?

27:55.207 --> 27:57.076
Yeah, but we'd have
to rename every Wi-Fi network

27:57.109 --> 27:58.811
inside the three-mile radius

27:58.845 --> 28:00.346
to that trusted network.
Yeah, but how many thousands

28:00.379 --> 28:01.948
of routers are there
in Adams Morgan?

28:01.981 --> 28:03.182
I mean, we don't need
to reassign them all.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.216
Just enough to blanket the area.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.818
KRUMITZ:
Okay.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.386
I got Jake's mom's phone.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.488
Their home Wi-Fi network
is Hazelton Home.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.390
Right, the phone will recognize
that name and connect.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.225
But it's gonna take some hacking

28:13.259 --> 28:14.493
to rename the signals
in our radius.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.028
Let's go.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.329
All right.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.831
D.B., you're here
at home base.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.933
Elijah, Krumitz,
we're going to Adams Morgan.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.434
We find anything,
we'll reach out.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.003
Okay, let's do this.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.416
All right,
we're in the three-mile radius.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.856
NELSON:
Guys, we're at 50%.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.758
No sign of Jake's phone.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.399
D.B., Jake's phone
just connected

28:53.432 --> 28:55.001
to one of the Wi-Fi networks.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.803
All right, can we find
his location?

28:56.836 --> 28:58.237
With Wi-Fi, we can call him
on the Internet.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.006
That's great, Raven.
Do it, pull it up.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.173
Put it on speaker.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.944
D.B., we're just going
in circles here.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.145
You guys have
to give us something.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.881
Avery, we're trying to reach
Jake right now on his phone.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.316
Got him on speaker.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.188
Mom?

29:16.222 --> 29:18.090
No, Jake, this is D.B. Russell

29:18.124 --> 29:19.258
with the FBI.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.492
Look, d-don't hang up.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.561
Jake, you haven't done
anything wrong.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.998
We just need you to tell us
exactly where you are right now.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.566
Is there anyone else there
with you?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.535
Avery, we've got Jake on the
line; we're talking to him now.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.270
No, I'm waiting.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.438
I'm at the community...

29:32.471 --> 29:33.572
Oh, no!

29:33.605 --> 29:35.007
(panting)

29:36.208 --> 29:38.177
Help!

29:38.210 --> 29:39.578
Help, please!

29:39.611 --> 29:40.980
Help!
Jake?

29:41.013 --> 29:43.149
Help me, please! Help!
Jake?

29:43.182 --> 29:44.350
Come on, please, please!
All right, all right.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.185
So that means that Echo
is with him right now.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.587
He said community.
Community something. Find it.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.022
Somewhere in Adams Morgan.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.892
Avery, look for signage
with the word community.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.326
Raven, you've gotta give us
something more than that.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.929
Avery, his phone
is still live,

29:56.963 --> 29:58.931
but we've lost Jake.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.166
We're running out of time.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.567
Two shots were just fired,
Avery.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.435
Get us a location now!

30:03.469 --> 30:04.470
Hey, hey, guys, guys,

30:04.503 --> 30:07.139
D.C. has
a gunshot locator system.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.141
It detects and gets the location
of gunshots

30:09.175 --> 30:10.476
using acoustic sensors.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.111
We need authorized access
to that site.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.913
RYAN: Don't worry about that
right now!

30:13.946 --> 30:14.881
Hack it if you need to.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.182
Do it, pull it up right now.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.116
Raven, focus on Adams Morgan.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.951
RUSSELL: Find the last
sensor recordings.

30:18.985 --> 30:22.121
Use time and distance
between the sensors.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.090
Where they intersect
will be our location. Go.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.491
NELSON:
Okay, we got it, we got it.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.459
RUSSELL: Avery, go to
Adams Morgan Community Pool.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.105
RYAN: Raven, send units

30:39.138 --> 30:40.239
to the location.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.440
Set up a roadblock.
No one goes in or out.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.475
MUNDO: Nelson, we're gonna need
SWAT backup.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.877
All right,
I'm calling Dispatch now.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.578
Hey, Jake? Jake?

30:48.547 --> 30:50.549
More gunshots
were just fired, Avery.

30:54.020 --> 30:54.987
Stop!

30:55.021 --> 30:56.889
(groans)

31:24.083 --> 31:26.085
(tires squealing)

31:36.728 --> 31:37.930
Go, go, go!

31:37.964 --> 31:39.365
We got a runner!

31:39.398 --> 31:40.599
Go, go!

31:49.675 --> 31:51.477
(grunting)

31:53.545 --> 31:55.081
Where's Jake Hazelton?

31:55.114 --> 31:56.348
He's dead!

32:00.352 --> 32:01.453
KRUMITZ:
He's in the water!

32:01.487 --> 32:03.956
RYAN:
Got it! Got it!

32:03.990 --> 32:04.490
Go, Krummy!

32:10.629 --> 32:11.663
SOLDIER:
Come on.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.633
I got him.
I got him. Got him.

32:14.666 --> 32:15.667
RYAN:
Come on, come on!

32:18.404 --> 32:20.139
Okay...
Okay. Got his head.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.740
RYAN:
Okay.
(coughing)

32:21.773 --> 32:23.009
He's breathing!
He's breathing!

32:23.042 --> 32:24.143
I'm Deputy Director
Avery Ryan.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.112
We're from the FBI.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.413
You're safe.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.048
We're gonna get you
to a hospital.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.649
Krummy, he's gonna make it!
You did great!

32:30.682 --> 32:32.251
(gasping):
Okay...

32:32.284 --> 32:33.319
(laughs)

32:33.352 --> 32:34.620
(splutters)

32:45.197 --> 32:46.232
Dang, D.B.!

32:46.265 --> 32:48.267
Smooth with all
the ladies, huh?

32:48.300 --> 32:50.036
Yes, I am.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.643
Yes, I am.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.415
A job well done.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.217
RYAN: What happens
to Jake now?

33:05.251 --> 33:08.620
Well, we can protect him
under Responsible Disclosure.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.257
Well, that will make Agent
Daniel Krumitz very happy.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.393
Jake went to Wizard
because he needed help.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.062
They wanted to do
the right thing.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.297
Well, thank you, Avery.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.798
You make us look good.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.667
KRUMITZ: Yeah! I mean,
I went right in.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.901
It was, like,
just instant, so...

33:22.934 --> 33:25.471
I really, I feel like
I want to do a little
less tech stuff,

33:25.504 --> 33:27.306
and a little more, like,
take down the bad guy,

33:27.339 --> 33:28.374
rescue-type stuff...
Is that right?

33:28.407 --> 33:29.408
MAN: Elijah Mundo.
Yes.

33:30.576 --> 33:31.610
You've been served.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.315
Well, what is it?

33:40.319 --> 33:42.388
A restraining order
from Nina Moore.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.689
I'm having you banned
from this hospital.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.457
I'm just trying
to help you.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.592
I don't want your help!

33:48.094 --> 33:51.163
I want you to leave!
Stay out of my life!

33:51.197 --> 33:53.699
Enough is enough.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.609
Raven, before you leave, I...

34:03.642 --> 34:06.212
No, Avery, please,
let me go first.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.116
This is really hard.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.220
I love my job...

34:14.253 --> 34:17.323
and everyone here
is my family.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.628
What happens next is in
the hands of the judge,

34:22.661 --> 34:26.098
and I can only
hope that I...

34:26.132 --> 34:27.466
I-I get time served.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.201
And then what?

34:29.235 --> 34:31.437
Well, I'll still
have a record,

34:31.470 --> 34:33.272
so there's no chance for
me to go to Quantico.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.606
Private sector, maybe?

34:34.640 --> 34:37.709
Raven, you don't have to be
an agent to work here.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.112
You can be a consultant.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.684
I want you to know
I really believe in you.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.292
(sighs heavily)

35:03.235 --> 35:04.503
Hi.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.172
What's going on?

35:07.906 --> 35:10.542
You know, when you...
you're young and you,

35:10.576 --> 35:12.544
you wish you were
older because...

35:12.578 --> 35:13.745
you could do
whatever you wanted?

35:13.779 --> 35:15.281
Uh-huh.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.216
And then you-you
get older and then

35:17.249 --> 35:19.485
you wish you were
younger because,

35:19.518 --> 35:21.653
if you knew then
what you know now,

35:21.687 --> 35:23.689
you-you could've done
anything you wanted.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.391
Uh-oh.

35:25.424 --> 35:26.492
What?

35:26.525 --> 35:27.793
What you're saying...

35:27.826 --> 35:29.661
strangely makes
sense to me.

35:29.695 --> 35:33.165
Good, because I'm... I'm
staring at that moment

35:33.199 --> 35:35.434
in my life, right now,
where I could...

35:35.467 --> 35:37.703
do what really
makes me happy.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.706
Right now.

35:40.739 --> 35:43.542
But I'm gonna need you to
accept my resignation, Avery.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.314
(voice breaking):
What?

35:48.347 --> 35:52.251
I have loved every single
second that I have spent

35:52.284 --> 35:54.486
at Cyber Division.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.324
You know, I'm done with bodies
and DNA and epithelials

35:58.357 --> 36:02.261
and Bluetooth devices
and pi boards.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.262
I'm just done.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.463
Oh, come on!

36:04.496 --> 36:05.864
It's Greer, isn't it?
(laughing)

36:05.897 --> 36:07.766
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.801
I have a seat
on a red-eye

36:09.835 --> 36:12.204
that could change my life.

36:15.741 --> 36:16.742
Aw...

36:20.946 --> 36:22.348
I'm gonna come back
in two months

36:22.381 --> 36:23.615
and do this the right way,
I promise you.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.517
Okay.
Okay.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.628
Chocolate!

36:39.265 --> 36:41.267
(laughing)

36:42.268 --> 36:44.236
You poured your heart
out to me

36:44.270 --> 36:45.671
and I said chocolate.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.507
I don't care what you say
as long as you're here!

36:48.540 --> 36:49.941
(groaning happily)

36:52.744 --> 36:55.247
You're not gonna
marry her, right?

36:55.281 --> 36:56.648
Right.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.419
I'm yours.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.667
I'm sorry, Elijah.

37:15.701 --> 37:16.835
Nina-- whoa, whoa.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.604
Put the gun down.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.938
I realize the restraining order
was a bad move

37:19.971 --> 37:20.939
and I knew you'd be mad.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.674
That's not what I wanted.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.242
I just wanted
to be your friend.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.244
MUNDO:
I know that, so...

37:26.278 --> 37:27.313
why-why don't you
just put the gun down,

37:27.346 --> 37:29.715
and we'll talk about it.
No, I don't want to do that.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.549
I've already tried
to talk to you,

37:30.582 --> 37:32.318
but you don't answer
my phone calls

37:32.351 --> 37:33.919
anymore, and you don't
come to the bar,

37:33.952 --> 37:35.987
and all you do
is you push me away!

37:37.055 --> 37:38.824
(gunshots)

37:38.857 --> 37:40.292
Stay down. Stay down.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.729
He's losing
a lot of blood.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.631
RYAN:
D.B.!

37:47.366 --> 37:49.000
You're gonna make it,
do you hear me?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.035
You're gonna make it!

37:51.603 --> 37:52.838
Stay with me!
I'm right here!

37:52.871 --> 37:54.840
D.B., D.B.!
Do you hear me?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.308
You're gonna make it!

37:56.342 --> 37:57.743
MUNDO: He saved me.
She was gonna kill me.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.910
He saved my life.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.446
MICHAELS: Parking garage of
the FBI Building, Level B.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.713
We need help
right away!

38:01.747 --> 38:02.914
NELSON:
You'll be okay.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.984
RYAN:
D.B.!

38:06.017 --> 38:08.354
D.B.! D.B.!

38:08.387 --> 38:10.822
(echoing):
D.B.!

38:17.062 --> 38:18.897
KRUMITZ: Now, if you can
think outside the box,

38:18.930 --> 38:20.732
have mad hacking skills,

38:20.766 --> 38:22.668
and write code with
your eyes closed,

38:22.701 --> 38:25.404
you could have a future at
the FBI Cyber Division.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.105
You could be part of
the first class

38:27.138 --> 38:28.340
of the Young
Apprentice Program.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.475
And I was just kidding about

38:29.508 --> 38:30.476
writing code with
your eyes closed,

38:30.509 --> 38:31.677
unless you can do it.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.360
Ah, ah!
(laughs)

38:48.394 --> 38:49.361
(laughing)

38:49.395 --> 38:50.762
Ah!
Go, girl, go!

38:50.796 --> 38:52.030
RYAN: Go! Go!

38:52.063 --> 38:53.432
(laughing)
Go!

38:53.465 --> 38:54.700
You look lovely.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.103
MUNDO: What, are they
taking anybody these days?

38:58.136 --> 38:59.337
(Nelson laughs)

38:59.371 --> 39:01.373
RAMIREZ: Look at you!
MUNDO: There's no height
requirement.

39:01.407 --> 39:02.974
What?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.376
I still can't believe
they gave you a gun.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.012
Hey, man, I'm a graduate
of Quantico.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.147
Agent Brody Nelson.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.148
Sound good, don't it?
It does, it does.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.451
I know.
Yes, it does.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.752
Ah! Avery!

39:13.785 --> 39:15.954
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.690
RYAN: I'm so proud
of you, Brody Nelson.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.691
Oh, no, you didn't!

39:19.725 --> 39:20.926
Yes, I did.
Oh, damn!

39:20.959 --> 39:23.028
Bam, bam, ow! Look at that!
That's my boy!

39:23.061 --> 39:24.796
Check me out.
This is unbelievable,
that you let this happen.

39:24.830 --> 39:25.664
Look at that.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.033
Hey, man, I am an official
FBI agent.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.402
You already packing?
Geez, Louise!
(everyone laughing)

39:30.436 --> 39:31.670
Oh, oh, oh!

39:31.703 --> 39:34.005
Since, uh, since Raven
is a consultant now

39:34.039 --> 39:36.041
and I'm an FBI agent, does that
mean I get to boss her around?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.176
What?!
Absolutely not!

39:38.209 --> 39:39.244
Why not?
(scoffs)

39:39.277 --> 39:41.813
There's no way! She could
beat you up with a gun!

39:41.847 --> 39:43.449
(all laughing)

39:43.482 --> 39:44.249
RAMIREZ:
Man...

39:44.282 --> 39:46.852
I wish D.B. was here
to see this.

39:46.885 --> 39:47.853
Yeah, me, too, baby.
Yeah.

39:47.886 --> 39:48.887
Oh, thank you.

39:50.489 --> 39:54.426
And he would never believe
FBI Agent Brody Nelson.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.761
Aw, come on.
Right?

39:55.794 --> 39:57.128
Brody Nelson
with a gun.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.731
I don't think any of us
really believe that it's
actually happening.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.033
D.B. had faith
in me, okay?

40:02.067 --> 40:03.034
MUNDO:
Not that much faith.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.636
KRUMITZ:
To your face, maybe.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.906
(everyone continues
chatting, laughing)

40:14.613 --> 40:16.114
LATIMORE:
Wait a second...
(laughs)

40:16.147 --> 40:17.449
You're still
carrying around

40:17.483 --> 40:20.218
that cane for sympathy,
aren't you?

40:20.251 --> 40:22.621
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Mm-hmm.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.189
And it's working, too.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.224
I'm getting extra pastries
wherever I go.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.793
Oh!
And...

40:27.826 --> 40:29.795
free French lessons at Lulu's.

40:29.828 --> 40:30.929
(laughs)

40:30.962 --> 40:32.163
Well, let me
hear a little.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.467
(with French accent):
Ho-ho!

40:35.501 --> 40:37.135
Ho-ho!
That's all I got.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.004
(both laughing)

40:39.037 --> 40:41.507
I will drink to that.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.012
Mmm!

40:48.013 --> 40:49.981
I'm gonna lay some
French on him.

40:50.015 --> 40:53.585
(speaking hesitant French)

40:59.825 --> 41:01.126
(both laughing)

41:01.159 --> 41:02.728
That was very good.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.863
Thank you.
I've been practicing.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.766
So this is what happily
ever after looks like.

41:07.799 --> 41:08.800
Mm-hmm.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.002
How do you like it?

41:11.036 --> 41:13.705
It-it-it's better
than my wildest dreams.

41:16.542 --> 41:17.809
Come here.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.181
(Latimore laughs)
Oh, my.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.517
(both laughing)

41:25.551 --> 41:26.518
RUSSELL:
Oh, la-la.

41:26.552 --> 41:27.719
(both laughing)

41:27.753 --> 41:29.755
LATIMORE:
Aw, enchanté.

41:29.788 --> 41:30.856
RUSSELL:
You're something else.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.190
