WEBVTT

00:27.527 --> 00:29.904
We're here! We're here!

00:29.988 --> 00:31.322
Took you long enough.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.867
Oh, you know, your dad.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.370
Well, Kelly and I set up everything.
We did the tables and chairs.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.455
So, y'all can relax.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.831
You should've told us, we could've helped.

00:39.914 --> 00:43.752
-I told him to, but he--

00:43.835 --> 00:46.755
-Yeah, yeah.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.592
Didn't get dressed up? That's okay.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.844
All righty then.
Oh, look, this is perfect.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.429
You get the tripod I gave you guys?

00:56.014 --> 00:57.974
-That's okay. I have one in the truck.
-Oh, okay.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.642
-I'll take the photo.
-No, no, no.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.560
No, I got it.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.478
-Yep.
-Oh, no.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.521
No, you're not gonna want a photo
in a couple of years

01:03.605 --> 01:05.440
with some random girl Gus was dating.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.357
-All right.
-Yeah, we do.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.528
I mean, not in that way,
but we want you, too.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.571
Let her take it.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.532
All right, everybody, happy 40th!

01:14.616 --> 01:16.534
Happy 40th!

01:17.077 --> 01:19.913
All right, there you go.
Okay.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.748
Perfect. Good, good.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.000
I'm gonna put the music on, Mom.
-Oh, thank you.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.711
-Yeah.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.755
Where did you get that?
This is called a 40-50.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.549
When we went into the party store...
They got 30-40. I went 40-50.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.968
-Yeah. I, oh, wow. Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.595
-Hey.
-Jesus!

01:35.678 --> 01:37.430
Sorry, I knew that was gonna happen.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.474
I was, like,
"I'm gonna scare her right here, so..."

01:39.557 --> 01:42.101
What do you want?
-Um...

01:42.977 --> 01:46.105
I just wanted to apologize
about last night,

01:46.189 --> 01:48.691
-the stuff that was said.
-I'm gonna go back to LA.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.984
What?

01:50.068 --> 01:52.112
I'm looking for flights
on my phone right now.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.447
-I'm gonna fly out in a few hours.
-Come on...

01:54.531 --> 01:58.368
-I hope they have that good potato salad.
-Oh, they always have potato salad.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.912
-Hey. Hi.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.039
We've been watching your <i>Witchita</i> show.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.084
Spooky stuff! Spooky, spooky stuff.

02:06.167 --> 02:10.463
Well, I'm glad you like it.
Um... Uh...

02:10.547 --> 02:13.216
-Sorry, this is my girlfriend Mickey.
Hello!

02:13.299 --> 02:14.551
-This is my...
-Hi, there.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.971
...Uncle Pat and Aunt Jo right there.
Yeah.

02:21.266 --> 02:26.396
So, yeah... Everybody's in there,
and I'll be in there soon.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.356
All right, okay...

02:28.439 --> 02:30.817
-We'll see you soon.
-See you soon. Okay, bye.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.402
Bye.
-Bye.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.614
So this is what you're doing?

02:36.698 --> 02:40.493
You're just threatening to break up
and leave now,

02:40.577 --> 02:42.620
because of what?
Because of a stupid fight?

02:42.704 --> 02:46.374
See, you still don't get it.
It wasn't stupid.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.961
You said I was unstable,
and you didn't see a future for us.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.046
Okay, look... When I heard you say that right now,

02:53.715 --> 02:57.302
I think maybe there has been
some sort of misunderstanding

02:57.385 --> 02:59.846
-or misinterpretation of what I said--
-No.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.557
It wasn't a fucking TS Eliot poem, Gus.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.976
It didn't need interpretation.
I knew what you meant.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.562
Look, this is very--

03:07.645 --> 03:10.440
This is insane, okay?
We haven't ever talked about this before.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.441
I don't even know my...

03:11.524 --> 03:13.693
God damn it! Fucking shit! Hey! -Hey, Gus!
-Hi.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.906
-Hello.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.325
Oh, this is my girlfriend Mickey.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.952
And this is my cousin Lisa
and her family. Hi, guys.

03:23.036 --> 03:27.040
I've already seen her all over Facebook,
so I feel like I know her already.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.501
-Oh, yeah, sure.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.630
No, I don't think there's a TV. Sorry.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.715
-Mom, you said there'd be a TV!
-You lied!

03:35.798 --> 03:37.383
No, nobody lied. Let's go.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.761
Hey!

03:39.844 --> 03:42.931
I gotta get outta here, 'cause I cannot
be the welcoming committee, okay?

03:43.014 --> 03:44.515
-I'm going back to LA.
-You can't do this.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.392
-You can't do this to me.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.770
Because this is gonna be
fuckin' hell, okay?

03:48.853 --> 03:51.397
Being trapped here with my family
and pretending everything's okay,

03:51.481 --> 03:53.191
while you and me are falling apart?

03:54.943 --> 03:55.944
Please?

03:57.153 --> 03:58.571
Fine, I will stay for this party,

03:58.655 --> 04:02.075
but then I am leaving afterwards,
and you can stay here until the--

04:02.158 --> 04:03.493
Oh, my God.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.830
Can we just go in there?
'Cause I can't say hi to another person.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.793
They gone?
-No.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.712
-Go.
-Okay. They make you use their caterer

04:17.924 --> 04:19.259
-when you rent this place, though.
-Oh, yeah.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.094
It's a real sweet print, isn't it?

04:21.177 --> 04:23.680
-Isn't it sweet!
-This is just so tender.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.891
The beams on Tower 7
were demolished diagonally, okay?

04:26.975 --> 04:30.144
-When you do a regular demolition...
-Okay.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.564
-Mm-hmm.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.860
-Hello.
-Hi.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.529
I watched your witch show.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.780
What'd you think?

04:40.863 --> 04:45.535
I mean, I could do without
the devil worshiping and the paganism.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.245
And then one morning, we wake up,

04:47.328 --> 04:49.580
and our entire world is being run
by one government.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.542
You think so?
-Mm-hmm

04:52.625 --> 04:55.628
The only real obstacle
to selling recreational vehicles

04:55.712 --> 04:57.547
is that people consider it a luxury.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.799
That's partly a problem with the name.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.844
"Recreational." So what you do is,
you convince people,

05:02.927 --> 05:05.430
and I was telling you this earlier,
that it's a necessary luxury.

05:05.513 --> 05:09.267
That's how you hook 'em,
and then that's how you bring 'em in.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.435
All right, excuse me.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.063
I am just so proud of all my children.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.984
The dealerships
and the charities and the art shows

05:18.067 --> 05:20.320
and the teaching...
No, Gussie, your movie.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.905
Don't forget. That, too.

05:22.989 --> 05:27.744
I'm for the creative stuff, for sure,
but there's nobility in education.

05:27.827 --> 05:31.581
Teachers are heroes,
like a firefighter or a soldier, I think.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.874
Hmm.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.835
Okay, everybody, listen up!

05:36.252 --> 05:41.174
First of all, let's give it up for
Mr. and Mrs. Victoria and Mark Cruikshank.

05:43.885 --> 05:48.890
I mean, come on. Forty years!
I mean, seriously, folks?

05:50.475 --> 05:54.020
But, you know, a lot of people
probably don't know this...

05:54.103 --> 05:57.398
Mom and Dad, when they first got hitched,
did not have a honeymoon.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.192
Aww.
-Yeah. No honeymoon.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.235
-Sorry.
-They wanted to go to Hawaii,

06:01.319 --> 06:06.783
but instead, like they always did,
they sacrificed and pinched pennies,

06:06.866 --> 06:10.620
so they could provide a better life
for their family and their children.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.456
Well, Mom and Dad,

06:14.248 --> 06:16.334
I believe you've sacrificed enough.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.634
Aww!
-So, as an anniversary gift from me,

06:24.717 --> 06:28.012
Kelly, Nina and your future grandson,
of course,

06:28.096 --> 06:31.766
I think it is finally time
for you two to say aloha to Hawaii.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.309
-Oh!
-Yeah, you're going to Hawaii.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.602
-Oh!

06:34.685 --> 06:37.355
-Mom, Dad, get your butts up here!

06:37.855 --> 06:40.024
-We have a whole lei thing we want to do.
You're kidding, right?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.442
No.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.071
Was there an e-mail chain
I missed?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.030
No.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.242
Oh, honey. Oh, thank you.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.409
Aw!

06:53.204 --> 06:56.415
It's just this is a surprise to me, too.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.000
Wait. He didn't tell you?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.044
It's fine. I mean,
we can barely pay our mortgage.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.212
-But it's fine.
-Oh.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.715
-Kelly! Kelly, come here.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.468
I'm sorry.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.847
-Come on, honey. Come on, honey. Let's...

07:10.930 --> 07:13.307
Does anyone have a camera?
-His stupid shoes.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.101
What a pig in shit.

07:15.184 --> 07:18.229
-This is too much. It's too much, Ken.
-Say aloha.

07:20.606 --> 07:24.193
-Wow, very thoughtful, Ken.
-Well, they deserve it.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.736
Dude, what's wrong with you?

07:26.195 --> 07:29.490
What? No, I mean,
I wanted it to be a surprise, so...

07:29.574 --> 07:31.325
You made us look like losers.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.494
We could've pitched in
and given that together.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.873
But you guys spend your money
and travel here. That's your gift.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.126
I live here, so this is my gift.
I didn't want to burden you.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.836
It's too big.

07:41.919 --> 07:45.381
We should've done one of those
gift-from-the-kids kind of things.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.385
Yeah. Like, when we got them TiVos.
It was, like, $13 each.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.180
Okay... Gus, back me up here.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.390
You know what I'm doing here.
It's just a nice gesture.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.767
Yeah. No, it's very nice.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
It's good,
but I see where they're coming from.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.855
-A little bit, yeah.

08:00.938 --> 08:04.734
I thought you guys would be happy that
Mom and Dad finally get to go to Hawaii,

08:04.817 --> 08:06.444
but, all right,
just make it about yourselves.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.695
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.363
You're such a dick, do you know that?

08:09.447 --> 08:11.199
Oh, Andrew, we don't talk like that.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.451
-Okay, Drew, cut it.
-But he is a dick.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.869
He didn't even tell us about this gift.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.330
We couldn't pitch in if we wanted to.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.790
I didn't want to make you feel stupid.
I was doing it as a surprise.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.042
Don't do this to me again. Stop it!

08:30.927 --> 08:34.847
Well, uh, don't worry, Mom and Dad.
The three of us,

08:34.931 --> 08:37.058
we actually chipped in for a present, too,
and um... we're gonna pay for your magazines
on the flight to Hawaii.

08:41.103 --> 08:44.357
But just on the flight there, okay,
not the flight back. We can't afford that.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.945
-Oh! And we also got you this napkin.
Oh.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.240
It's the paper napkin year, right?
Forty years, yeah?

08:52.323 --> 08:53.491
Oh, who's this now?

08:54.909 --> 08:58.746
Hey, I'm an old man with my white hair.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.375
Hey, stop all this fightin' and fussin'.

09:02.458 --> 09:06.671
Y'all sound like me and Hillary
after she found out about Monica.

09:06.754 --> 09:11.467
I did not know
Ken was going to give that present.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.483
-My family, I told you they're insane.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.193
God. Did you see what Gus did?

09:29.277 --> 09:34.240
Like, every time shit gets weird,
he fuckin' turns into Jerry Seinfeld.

09:35.116 --> 09:39.579
Oh, he's really gotten super neurotic
since the whole Ridley Scott thing.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.373
You guys talking about Ken's insane gift?

09:42.456 --> 09:44.792
No, I was telling Mickey
about Ridley Scott.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.961
-Don't.
It's not that big of a deal.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.672
Okay, I don't know
how much Gus has told you,

09:49.755 --> 09:52.258
but when he first got to LA,
he was hot shit.

09:53.009 --> 09:53.843
Yeah.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.261
-Yeah. Totally.

09:55.344 --> 09:58.055
He wrote this script that everyone saw,

09:58.139 --> 10:01.976
and he took all these cushy meetings
with important people.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.103
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah. It was nuts.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.897
And he got a job
as Ridley Scott's assistant,

10:06.981 --> 10:10.484
but also to develop stuff with him.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.569
-He was set.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.155
-Yeah, it was so promising.
-Yeah.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.657
Until...

10:16.741 --> 10:19.910
Okay, so, I don't know what happened,
but he got in his head

10:19.994 --> 10:22.997
about his career not moving fast enough.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.666
This is, like, a few months in only.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.378
And so he sent Ridley
an e-mail saying, like,

10:29.879 --> 10:33.799
"I need you to take me more seriously,"
and on and on and on.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.635
-Yeah.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.637
That's ballsy. I like it.

10:37.720 --> 10:43.768
But the e-mail also included
a long exchange he had with our mom,

10:43.851 --> 10:46.103
and it said how he should word it.

10:46.187 --> 10:50.066
He was asking her all these questions
about what he should say in the e-mail,

10:50.149 --> 10:52.610
and that was all in there,
and the e-mail was just at the top.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.153
-Uh-oh.
-It was... yeah.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.072
-Yeah. So...
-Oh.

10:56.155 --> 11:00.284
And, of course,
Ridley sends it to everyone he knows,

11:00.368 --> 11:05.206
like directors, agents, managers,
studio execs, and he's like,

11:05.289 --> 11:09.710
"Look what my little assistant sent me
from his mommy."

11:10.544 --> 11:12.171
Did you guys see the e

11:12.254 --> 11:14.715
-Yeah, it's so bad. It's...
-It's awful.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.218
At one point, he even says,
"Thanks, Mommy."

11:17.301 --> 11:18.386
-Like, yeah.
-No.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.596
Oh, my God. Mom's hammered.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.141
I'm gonna give her the rest of my tequila
and see how fucked up she gets.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.560
Jesus!

11:27.478 --> 11:29.688
What? Last time she got hammered,

11:29.772 --> 11:32.733
she pushed Dad in the Rasmussens' pool.
It was awesome.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.527
You want to see that, right?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.153
I'm gonna go get some cake.

11:36.779 --> 11:40.741
No, I don't want to see that.
That's, like, deeply sad.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.078
Uh...

11:44.703 --> 11:47.081
-"China Doll" by David Bowie.
-Very good.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.000
-I'm cleaning up the cake.
-I see.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.298
Did you want a drink, honey?
No. Not right now.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.591
Okay.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.218
-Hey.
-Mmm.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.555
Everything okay?
-It's great. I'm having so much fun.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.474
-Oh, no, I'm good. This is my spot.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.437
I can see everybody and look at...
Oh, there's Mickey! Hey, Mickey!

12:09.520 --> 12:12.356
Get over here! There's my girl!

12:12.440 --> 12:13.691
-Come here.
-Okay.

12:13.774 --> 12:17.069
You're my girl.
Come on over here.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.612
Here she comes.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.449
Oh, Mickey, look at you.

12:22.032 --> 12:26.370
Mark and I were just talking,
and we decided that you're our favorite.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.247
-Oh, no.
That's true.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.040
It's very sweet of you.

12:30.124 --> 12:34.295
Of all the girls that Gussie brought home,
you are number one best.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.631
Really, so much better than that...
What's her name? Natalie.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.427
-Boom. Shots fired, Natalie.
-Well, Natalie was a bitch.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.512
-Let's just admit it.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.266
You know, I mean, I could tell, Gussie.
Moms always can tell.

12:47.349 --> 12:51.145
-Okay, Vicks, let's take it easy.
Um... Uh...

12:51.228 --> 12:54.273
Theresa.
-Yes.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.650
-I don't know about that.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.069
That seems like an oversimplification.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.740
Come on. The thing about Theresa was,
she was just boring.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.366
-Hmm.
-You'd say to her,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.869
"Oh, so, where are you from?"

13:06.952 --> 13:10.915
And she'd say, "Lansing."
Or wherever. And that was it.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.166
Hmm.
-Um...

13:15.127 --> 13:17.087
-Yeah, well, it's true.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.673
-Mickey's the very best.
-She's the number one best.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.218
The number one.
You have to grab on to this one.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.637
-This is the one to hold on to.
-I will.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.971
I'm not letting her go!

13:26.055 --> 13:27.806
My dad is leaving.
We should probably go say goodbye.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.143
Sure, let's go say bye to Daddy.
Here we go.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.110
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.701
-Fuck this.
Hey.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.828
Where you goin'?

13:49.912 --> 13:51.330
-Going to the airport.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.958
-Come on.
-I'm going to the airport!

13:54.041 --> 13:56.961
You lie to me so much.
I know about the whole Ridley Scott thing.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.964
Okay, look. It was late at night,
all right?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.841
I wasn't keeping track
of my e-mails. It was very confusing.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.467
I was forwarding stuff and was confused!

14:03.551 --> 14:05.761
Dude! Why wouldn't you tell me that?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.723
'Cause it's not a great seduction story,
Mickey, okay?

14:09.807 --> 14:11.308
On our first date, I'm not gonna go,

14:11.392 --> 14:14.061
"Hey. Just so you know,
I embarrassed myself in front of

14:14.144 --> 14:16.146
-half of--"
-Give me the keys.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.149
-Wait. You're just going to take the...
-Yeah.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.484
Give me the keys.

14:23.028 --> 14:23.863
-Thank--
-No.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.030
What

14:25.114 --> 14:26.615
-Give me the keys.
-I don't want to--

14:26.699 --> 14:28.868
Give me the key!
-Stop it.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.911
Gus.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.456
You think that I'm not ready
to be a mother,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.750
but you behave like a little baby.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.085
You've got all these lies,

14:38.168 --> 14:40.421
and you run and you hide,
and you keep secrets.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.132
You were engaged.
The whole Ridley Scott thing.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.342
And you tell your parents
you go to church?

14:45.426 --> 14:47.011
You're making it sound worse than it is.

14:47.094 --> 14:50.222
I'm just trying
to make people happy. Okay?

14:50.306 --> 14:52.099
So I lie and hide a little bit.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.269
I don't think there's anything super wrong
with that, Mickey.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.063
It's your whole family.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.566
Yeah, my family's nuts,
but we put it all out there.

15:00.649 --> 15:04.111
You don't even know my family, okay?
They're way deeper than that.

15:04.194 --> 15:08.866
You can't just come in and, like, "Oh,
two days, I sum up your whole family."

15:08.949 --> 15:10.367
Maybe I didn't want you to come with me,

15:10.451 --> 15:12.703
and it had nothing to do
with me and my family, okay?

15:15.122 --> 15:17.124
Is that what you're saying?
-Yeah, maybe.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.418
Maybe it was you. Maybe I didn't want
to bring you because you,

15:19.501 --> 15:21.420
not because of me,
not because of my family,

15:21.503 --> 15:23.380
not because we're keeping secrets.

15:23.464 --> 15:27.343
Or whatever Eugene O'Neill drama
you have in your head right now.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.595
All right. Cool.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.514
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.520
Go. I don't care.

15:40.439 --> 15:44.693
Can you just go in and say goodbye
to everybody?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.905
Just make up an excuse or something,
so I don't have to feel stupid.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.908
Yeah, I can do that.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.377
I just need a minute, okay?

16:17.017 --> 16:18.978
Uh... Hey, everybody...

16:19.061 --> 16:22.731
Sorry, bad news,
but Mickey's gotta leave town

16:22.815 --> 16:24.358
and go to the airport now.

16:24.984 --> 16:25.901
Wait, what?

16:26.527 --> 16:29.697
Yeah, something just came up at work,
and I gotta go.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.576
Actually, Mickey,
you don't have to do that. Uh...

16:35.411 --> 16:36.912
She's just being polite.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.875
She's upset with me
because I've been lying to her

16:41.959 --> 16:44.920
and hiding things from her and all of you.

16:45.004 --> 16:50.092
Really, just things that I'm super
embarrassed about or ashamed of.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.637
You know that movie I've been making
with Arya?

16:54.471 --> 16:56.181
Uh, she dropped out.

16:56.932 --> 17:02.646
She dropped out of the whole thing.
So now I'm just super in debt,

17:02.730 --> 17:05.566
and the only thing I have to show for it

17:05.649 --> 17:09.570
is a two-minute sizzle reel.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.116
-It's...

17:15.200 --> 17:16.285
nothing.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.203
It's...

17:18.704 --> 17:20.080
it's really...

17:20.873 --> 17:22.750
uh, nothing.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.212
Look,
my point was I just blew it with Arya.

17:28.797 --> 17:33.552
Honestly, I think I blow every
work opportunity I've ever been given. I blew it with Ridley Scott
and the director of <i>Liberty Down...</i>

17:39.975 --> 17:42.269
and I'll never be a writer on <i>Witchita</i>

17:42.352 --> 17:45.272
because the one time
I was invited in the writers' room,

17:45.355 --> 17:49.651
I flipped out and threw
a woman's computer across the desk. So...

17:49.735 --> 17:51.695
-Whoa, I didn't know that.
-Yeah. Me neither.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.198
Oh, yeah. No, I mean, it's nothing new.

17:54.281 --> 17:58.327
I mean,
I have serious anger control problems.

17:59.119 --> 18:04.500
Last month, I was driving my car,
and I had a serious case of road rage,

18:04.583 --> 18:09.838
and I lost control of my car.
I spun around, and I hit some cars and...

18:11.173 --> 18:13.467
I didn't tell anybody about it.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.261
You threw a woman's computer?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.305
Mom, you gotta keep up with me

18:18.388 --> 18:21.141
'cause I'm just gonna
roll right through these, okay?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.811
Uh, I don't think I believe in God.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.523
When I was nine,
I threw up in Mom's purse.

18:28.732 --> 18:32.152
You guys remember Natalie, right,
my ex

18:32.694 --> 18:37.616
She pretended to cheat on me
so that I would break up with her.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.327
But I didn't,
so she just had to break up with me.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.995
Hmm...

18:42.079 --> 18:44.081
Dad, I don't like sports.

18:44.164 --> 18:49.545
I just pretend to like sports so that
you and me have something to connect over.

18:50.546 --> 18:56.176
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I guess
what I'm just saying is that...

18:57.052 --> 19:01.390
You know, I try.
I try to pull a fast one on all of you

19:01.473 --> 19:04.935
and make you think I'm the perfect son

19:05.018 --> 19:09.273
or the perfect brother, but, uh...

19:10.858 --> 19:12.609
I'm a... I'm a fuck-up.

19:14.862 --> 19:19.158
And the only thing I really got going
for me is Mickey.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.705
But I'm fucking that up, too...

19:26.081 --> 19:29.376
'cause I told her last night that
she's not ready to have a family, but...

19:32.171 --> 19:33.422
I'm wrong.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.135
I'm the person who's not ready
to have a family and...

19:39.178 --> 19:41.722
it's just easier for me to go,

19:42.598 --> 19:45.434
"Mickey's the crazy one.
I'm the healthy one."

19:47.561 --> 19:48.979
But I'm the crazy one.

19:58.655 --> 20:03.118
All righty then. Good to know.
Can we finish cleaning up and go home?

20:08.165 --> 20:11.335
Okay, thank you. I...

20:32.731 --> 20:34.942
-I'm sorry. That was awful.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.527
That was awesome.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.072
-Yes.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.492
I mean, I've had some
intense conversations with my parents.

20:43.575 --> 20:48.664
I have never gotten as honest as that.
That was brave. It took guts.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.667
I feel so fucked up right now.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.935
Ugh.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.482
Ah! Feels good.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.944
Ah!

21:20.279 --> 21:21.780
Home.

21:24.741 --> 21:28.578
Mmm. Things got
kind of heavy back there in...

21:29.871 --> 21:31.456
Jesus, what's it called?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.583
-Brookings. Yeah.
-Brookings. Yeah.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.505
-But we got out of there alive.
-Yeah. Big time.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.676
Tell me about our future.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.054
Okay.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.309
Well, we move in together.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.102
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

21:52.185 --> 21:56.690
And then we get a little doggie.

21:56.773 --> 22:00.819
-Oh, I like that. A beagle.
-Yeah.

22:01.570 --> 22:08.160
Then, we get into couples therapy.

22:08.952 --> 22:14.458
-Get nice and sharp and strong.
-Yeah, yeah. And then...

22:16.960 --> 22:23.216
then we get married
and have babies.
