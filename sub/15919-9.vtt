00:00.078 --> 00:01.931
(Mary Jane) Previously
on Being Mary Jane...

00:01.940 --> 00:03.265
I had a really great
time tonight.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.931
Now I'm looking forward
to the next time.

00:04.941 --> 00:06.681
Well, then I'll try to
step it up the next time.

00:06.691 --> 00:08.251
Good night.
- Hi, Daddy.

00:08.253 --> 00:10.159
Where's--where's your mom?
- She went out.

00:10.174 --> 00:11.307
(Patrick) I'm over
here at Tracy's.

00:11.317 --> 00:13.260
I knock on the door to find
D'Asia all by herself.

00:13.262 --> 00:14.955
I want to get her to school,
but my car won't start,

00:14.957 --> 00:16.268
so if I could please
use your car,

00:16.270 --> 00:18.179
I'd greatly appreciate it.
- Sure. No problem.

00:18.181 --> 00:20.900
I've given up too much of what I
want in the Talk Back segment,

00:20.902 --> 00:23.168
but I finally figured out what
direction I want to take the show.

00:23.170 --> 00:26.926
Kara says you want to make
Talk Back Talk Black.

00:26.942 --> 00:29.848
Yeah, all black everything.

00:30.208 --> 00:31.573
(Mary Jane) According to the U.S.
Department

00:31.583 --> 00:33.073
of Health and Human Services,

00:33.083 --> 00:35.031
human trafficking is
the second-largest

00:35.041 --> 00:36.824
criminal industry
in the world today,

00:36.834 --> 00:39.281
only behind drug trafficking.

00:39.291 --> 00:42.323
300,000 people are trafficked
annually in the U.S.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.073
These numbers and these
facts are staggering.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.198
Here to shed light on
those dark statistics

00:47.208 --> 00:49.699
is my guest, founder
of Bridget's Dream,

00:49.709 --> 00:51.156
an organization committed

00:51.166 --> 00:53.782
to helping trafficking
victims become survivors

00:53.792 --> 00:55.407
and learn to dream again.

00:55.417 --> 00:56.824
Leah Albright-Byrd,
welcome to the show.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.448
Thank you for having me.

00:58.458 --> 01:01.156
As horrible as that
300,000 number is,

01:01.166 --> 01:03.365
the truth is, the majority of
them are women and children.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.364
Is that correct?
- Yes. That's correct.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.949
In fact, the average age
of entry in our country

01:07.959 --> 01:09.490
is 12 to 14.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.907
I think many Americans
believe that sex trafficking

01:11.917 --> 01:14.615
is something that happens to
women in other countries,

01:14.625 --> 01:16.407
but the enslavement and
rape of young girls

01:16.417 --> 01:19.198
is happening right here,
in our land of the free.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.907
Yes, that's absolutely true,

01:20.917 --> 01:23.490
and as long as we continue
to think that it's a problem

01:23.500 --> 01:27.240
that's only impacting those
from other parts of the world,

01:27.250 --> 01:31.615
we overlook that 75% of the
victims in our country

01:31.625 --> 01:34.573
are American citizens,
and of that 75%,

01:34.583 --> 01:37.198
88% are minorities.

01:37.208 --> 01:38.532
(Mary Jane) And there
are people like you

01:38.542 --> 01:40.115
and Jada Pinkett Smith

01:40.125 --> 01:42.907
who are screaming at the top of
their lungs about this issue

01:42.917 --> 01:46.156
and how it affects American
children, especially our girls.

01:46.166 --> 01:48.699
In fact, you were an
advocate for the passing

01:48.709 --> 01:50.240
of Prop 35 in California,

01:50.250 --> 01:53.115
groundbreaking legislation
that helps protect victims.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.657
Please, explain the impact

01:54.667 --> 01:56.907
that the new law will have
on the state of California.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.073
Sure.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.949
So now that Prop
35 has passed,

01:59.959 --> 02:02.281
it will ensure
that prison terms

02:02.291 --> 02:04.240
for human traffickers
are increased.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.073
It also requires
those who've been

02:06.083 --> 02:09.240
convicted of human trafficking
to register as sex offenders,

02:09.250 --> 02:12.907
and lastly, it mandates
law enforcement training

02:12.917 --> 02:15.573
for every law enforcement
officer throughout the state

02:15.583 --> 02:18.073
with a goal and an objective

02:18.083 --> 02:20.323
of making sure that
those officers are able

02:20.333 --> 02:21.573
to better identify victims

02:21.583 --> 02:24.073
and not treat children
as criminals.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.240
(Mary Jane) I know
your organization,

02:25.250 --> 02:27.156
Bridget's Dream,
which you founded,

02:27.166 --> 02:29.156
is an organization
that provides support

02:29.166 --> 02:31.073
for survivors of trafficking.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.532
But was it a personal mission?

02:32.542 --> 02:34.782
Yes, it was definitely
a personal mission.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.949
I am a survivor myself.

02:36.959 --> 02:40.532
So my exploitation happened
between the ages of 14 and 18,

02:40.542 --> 02:42.407
after I ran away from home,

02:42.417 --> 02:45.156
and there are so many
kids that are vulnerable.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.907
There's about 2.8 million
runaway American youth a year,

02:48.917 --> 02:52.198
and so during my exploitation

02:52.208 --> 02:54.156
and while I was on the
streets, I met a young lady.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.615
Her name was Bridget Gray,

02:55.625 --> 02:57.240
and unfortunately,

02:57.250 --> 02:59.865
she did not get out the
way that I was able to.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.448
And so while I was in
my recovery process,

03:02.458 --> 03:03.782
she was murdered,

03:03.792 --> 03:06.782
and she then became the
inspiration for the work

03:06.792 --> 03:08.365
that we now do.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.407
(Mary Jane) I mean, I've
heard stories of parents

03:10.417 --> 03:12.115
selling their own children--

03:12.125 --> 03:15.573
that our foster care system
actually feeds this nightmare.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.740
How do we help our
young girls and boys

03:17.750 --> 03:19.699
avoid being trafficked
altogether?

03:19.709 --> 03:20.949
Well, the main thing
is education.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.782
So we have to educate
them, for one,

03:22.792 --> 03:24.073
about their vulnerabilities.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.448
It's our job to
protect our children,

03:26.458 --> 03:28.073
and we have to make
sure that they know

03:28.083 --> 03:29.573
some of the risk factors

03:29.583 --> 03:32.073
and they know the tactics and
the recruitment strategies

03:32.083 --> 03:33.615
that traffickers use.

03:33.625 --> 03:36.281
Lastly, it's also really
important that we educate them

03:36.291 --> 03:38.490
about internet safety.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.073
I think social media
is a phenomenal tool

03:41.083 --> 03:42.573
that we have as a society,

03:42.583 --> 03:45.281
but it's also a tool that
traffickers are using

03:45.291 --> 03:47.240
to recruit children.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.490
Well, now, what specifically
are some of the tactics?

03:49.500 --> 03:51.532
Well, it's not uncommon
with social media

03:51.542 --> 03:54.490
to equate your
social media success

03:54.500 --> 03:56.699
with the number of friends
or followers that you have,

03:56.709 --> 03:58.615
and so a lot of times,
kids are just accepting

03:58.625 --> 04:01.198
friend requests from people
that they do not know.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.365
They don't know that this is a
person who's targeting them,

04:04.375 --> 04:06.907
and so pimps take
advantage of that.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.198
Traffickers take
advantage of that.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.824
They create profiles and
request these kids,

04:10.834 --> 04:12.448
and then recruit
them that way.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.490
Leah Albright-Byrd, thank you
so much for being here today.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.281

We're on at 2:00.

Just say it, Kara.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.240
I already did.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.865
Are you still gonna have time
to meet with the producers?

05:22.875 --> 05:25.073

- Great.

07:21.625 --> 07:25.073
(Lance) What about a piece on
school shooting classifications?

07:25.083 --> 07:26.740
If a shooting is labeled
a gang shooting,

07:26.750 --> 07:28.073
it doesn't make the news,

but if it's deemed
a school shooting,

entry point for a discussion

29:29.544 --> 29:31.832
like the one I hope
to have today--

29:31.842 --> 29:34.050
a news item, a
documentary, a book,

29:34.052 --> 29:37.249
or a radical act that allows
us to take a deeper dive

29:37.259 --> 29:39.207
into a topic like
black women's beauty.

29:39.217 --> 29:40.957
I missed my window
on this subject

29:40.967 --> 29:43.373
when Psychology Today
published an article

29:43.383 --> 29:46.456
that brought into question
black women's beauty.

29:46.466 --> 29:48.456
They didn't say that
we were not beautiful.

29:48.466 --> 29:50.498
They said we were
straight-up ugly.

29:50.508 --> 29:51.999
They did.

29:52.009 --> 29:56.581
Psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa
actually tried to prove

29:56.591 --> 29:59.124
scientifically that we
were less attractive.

29:59.134 --> 30:01.082
See, I just knew
that this story

30:01.092 --> 30:02.456
was going to be all
over the news,

30:02.466 --> 30:05.915
but what happened next is
what astonished me more.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.207
The story came and went.

30:07.217 --> 30:08.915
I mean, sure, some
black women bloggers

30:08.925 --> 30:11.290
wrote eloquent, angry
essays, and me and you--

30:11.300 --> 30:12.790
we tweeted about
it, Michaela,

30:12.800 --> 30:14.040
but that was about it.

30:14.050 --> 30:15.456
The article was taken down,

30:15.466 --> 30:17.498
but no one rattled the
cages for black women

30:17.508 --> 30:19.207
except black women.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.331
So maybe Satoshi
was an entry point

30:21.341 --> 30:23.373
to the deeper issues
I was looking for.

30:23.383 --> 30:25.832
Uh-oh, Mary Jane, where
are you going with this?

30:25.842 --> 30:27.373
Hold on to your hats.

30:27.383 --> 30:28.581
(Mary Jane) I mean, forget
if we're ugly or not.

30:28.591 --> 30:30.040
Maybe it's worse.

30:30.050 --> 30:32.873
Maybe black women are
invisible to our own men,

30:32.883 --> 30:34.082
or even worse than that,

30:34.092 --> 30:36.790
black women are just not
worth fighting for.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.082
Mark, does an attack like this
do more damage to black women

30:40.092 --> 30:42.165
than the silence of black men?

30:42.175 --> 30:43.707
If we're going to be
honest, we've been dealing

30:43.717 --> 30:45.707
with 200 years of these
kinds of attacks, right.

30:45.717 --> 30:48.873
So this is not anything
new or unusual.

30:48.883 --> 30:50.790
What I think is
really at the--

30:50.800 --> 30:53.623
what's really egging black women
on at this period in time

30:53.633 --> 30:55.207
is this feeling of betrayal--

30:55.217 --> 30:58.373
that black men did not close
ranks around them, right.

30:58.383 --> 31:01.581
That black male silence was
complicit in the attacks

31:01.591 --> 31:03.999
that came from this
particular magazine.

31:04.009 --> 31:05.540
Black women, historically,

31:05.550 --> 31:08.540
have always closed ranks
around black male issues.

31:08.550 --> 31:10.498
Black women should expect
the same kind of support

31:10.508 --> 31:11.790
from black men.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.040
India, your hits,
Video, and Brown Skin,

31:14.050 --> 31:15.540
and I Am Not My Hair--

31:15.550 --> 31:16.999
they were all new anthems

31:17.009 --> 31:19.665
that ushered in a new
millennium for black women.

31:19.675 --> 31:21.456
Does that movement
still exist?

31:21.466 --> 31:23.373
It's certainly not the
mainstream movement.

31:23.383 --> 31:24.623
We turn on television,

31:24.633 --> 31:26.373
and we know what the
mainstream movement is,

31:26.383 --> 31:27.957
and it's actually
the polar opposite

31:27.967 --> 31:30.082
of the socially
responsible message

31:30.092 --> 31:31.415
that we're talking about,

31:31.425 --> 31:33.581
that was so popular in
the early millennium.

31:33.591 --> 31:35.456
But...

31:35.466 --> 31:38.498
I meet children of
that legacy every day.

31:38.508 --> 31:41.373
I've been in the music
industry for 15 years,

31:41.383 --> 31:44.373
and just in the last 3
years, I meet grown women--

31:44.383 --> 31:46.373
25, 26, who say,

31:46.383 --> 31:47.415
"I grew up on your music,"

31:47.425 --> 31:49.707
and they do things
like, "My hair--"

31:49.717 --> 31:51.124
this is because of you."

31:51.134 --> 31:53.373
When you were
writing these hits

31:53.383 --> 31:56.623
that spoke so eloquently to
black women and our struggle,

31:56.633 --> 31:58.915
collectively, did
you feel beautiful?

31:58.925 --> 31:59.873
Did you feel empowered?

31:59.883 --> 32:02.249
Were you empowered?

32:02.259 --> 32:05.581
Or were they more like
mantras that you were--

32:05.591 --> 32:07.456
would hope to
sort of catch on,

32:07.466 --> 32:10.373
to hype women up to actually
believe that about ourselves?

32:10.383 --> 32:12.999
That is a multitiered
question for me,

32:13.009 --> 32:16.581
because I was so young.
I was in my early 20s,

32:16.591 --> 32:19.124
and I did--
I felt good about myself.

32:19.134 --> 32:20.873
I didn't think I was
perfect, obviously.

32:20.883 --> 32:23.999
I had my issues, but I
felt good about myself,

32:24.009 --> 32:27.498
but I started, just as I was
coming into the public eye--

32:27.508 --> 32:30.873
started seeing that other people
didn't think I was beautiful.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.623
And so I would say, "I'm this.
I'm not that."

32:33.633 --> 32:35.540
I'm not the average
girl from your video."

32:35.550 --> 32:36.581
Like, I would say-- right?

32:36.591 --> 32:37.665
Mm-hmm.

32:37.675 --> 32:39.707
At the core of those songs,

32:39.717 --> 32:42.373
it's really about self-worth,

32:42.383 --> 32:43.957
self-definition,

32:43.967 --> 32:45.373
and why would you
allow anyone else

32:45.383 --> 32:47.540
to be the authority on you?

32:47.550 --> 32:50.456
Now, you know, one could argue
that the horrific comments

32:50.466 --> 32:52.124
made in Psychology Today--

32:52.134 --> 32:53.999
comments that were
then co-signed

32:54.009 --> 32:56.373
by black men's silence--
could leave black women

32:56.383 --> 32:58.456
with a post-traumatic
stress disorder.

32:58.466 --> 32:59.999
Is that why it meant so much

33:00.009 --> 33:02.790
that Lupita Nyong'o
won the Oscar

33:02.800 --> 33:04.832
or graced the cover of People
Magazine's Most Beautiful issue

33:04.842 --> 33:06.373
or cover of Vogue,

33:06.383 --> 33:08.249
or that she's starring in
the highly-anticipated

33:08.259 --> 33:09.498
new Star Wars movie?

33:09.508 --> 33:10.957
Michaela, shed some
light on that.

33:10.967 --> 33:13.415
It's insane, this discussion
that we're having.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.373
When you think about
it-- look at us.

33:15.383 --> 33:16.873
Look at how beautiful we are.

33:16.883 --> 33:18.540
Look at all the
colors in your skin,

33:18.550 --> 33:19.707
and all the colors in your skin,

33:19.717 --> 33:22.581
and all the colors
in Lupita's skin.

33:22.591 --> 33:25.581
This is what makes
black girls magic--

33:25.591 --> 33:27.124
like, that all of us can say,

33:27.134 --> 33:29.915
"We are sisters with this
plethora of beauty."

33:29.925 --> 33:31.540
Our hair can change shape

33:31.550 --> 33:34.207
and sizes with a hot
comb and some water.

33:34.217 --> 33:35.873
It shape shifts, then.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.915
We can be all these things,

33:37.925 --> 33:39.373
but we've become--

33:39.383 --> 33:40.873
they've become battlegrounds.
Right?

33:40.883 --> 33:42.456
The things that make
us so beautiful--

33:42.466 --> 33:44.748
no other group of
women can say this--

33:44.758 --> 33:46.040
can say that you
and I are sisters,

33:46.050 --> 33:47.456
where our skin is different.

33:47.466 --> 33:48.873
Our hair is different,
but we're together.

33:48.883 --> 33:50.124
Mm-hmm.
- But there's a--

33:50.134 --> 33:51.623
there's a whole
community of people

33:51.633 --> 33:53.540
trying to debunk our beauty.

33:53.550 --> 33:55.707
So there's a--
there's an insanity around it,

33:55.717 --> 33:57.873
and people like Lupita
and the First Lady

33:57.883 --> 33:59.748
start to be a salve
on this idea.

33:59.758 --> 34:01.165
But we have to--

34:01.175 --> 34:02.915
we have to say that we're magic.

34:02.925 --> 34:06.623
We have to say that our skin
is beautiful in all its hues

34:06.633 --> 34:08.373
and continue that conversation,

34:08.382 --> 34:10.706
because the other one
is relentless.

34:10.717 --> 34:12.915
And that's why the silence
from black men on this issue

34:12.925 --> 34:16.540
is complicit with the attacks
from Psychology Today.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.998
Too often, we've seen examples
of black women

34:19.009 --> 34:21.415
who go out on a limb
to not only support themselves,

34:21.425 --> 34:24.081
but also to nurture
and take care of the men

34:24.092 --> 34:25.623
and the boys
in their families.

34:25.632 --> 34:28.373
Very often, black men
will only go to the doctor

34:28.382 --> 34:29.831
to get a prostate exam

34:29.842 --> 34:32.456
because some woman more than
encouraged him to do that.

34:32.466 --> 34:35.373
We do not see that same kind
of encouragement

34:35.382 --> 34:38.206
amongst black men
for the lives of black women.

34:38.217 --> 34:40.748
Ask a black man,
"What is a fibroid?"

34:40.757 --> 34:43.040
We all--we all know
what prostate cancer is, right?

34:43.050 --> 34:44.456
Right. Yeah.

34:44.466 --> 34:46.998
And almost 80%
of all black women at some point

34:47.009 --> 34:50.623
suffer some--from some aspect
of fibroid disease.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.790
You'd be hard-pressed
to think of any disease

34:52.800 --> 34:56.206
that affected 80% of black men
that every black woman

34:56.217 --> 34:57.665
and girl in America wouldn't
know about.

34:57.675 --> 34:58.999
Say that.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.581
But our problem
is our problem,

35:00.591 --> 35:03.040
but your problems
are also our problems.

35:03.050 --> 35:04.957
We have to right the ship
on that.

35:04.967 --> 35:06.832
So what is beauty?

35:06.842 --> 35:09.207
Do we leave it up to the masses
to shape our imagery,

35:09.217 --> 35:11.249
or do we define it
for ourselves?

35:11.259 --> 35:12.915
Ultimately,
it comes down to having

35:12.925 --> 35:16.082
the self-worth and confidence
to stand in your own skin

35:16.092 --> 35:18.082
and fully embrace who you are.

35:18.092 --> 35:19.790
(Mary Jane on TV) I mean, how can
we expect others to see our worth

35:19.800 --> 35:21.915
when we continue
to dim our own light?

35:21.925 --> 35:24.373
The culture at large may not
see eye to eye on this topic,

35:24.383 --> 35:28.456
but having the discussion is
a part of the healing process.
