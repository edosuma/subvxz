WEBVTT

00:03.833 --> 00:06.301
Why do I have to move?
This is a city street!

00:06.303 --> 00:08.229
Because you're obstructing
pedestrian traffic.

00:08.230 --> 00:09.642
Now, if you don't move
across the street,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.577
I'm gonna have to write you up
for disorderly conduct.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.579
Oh, I <i>am</i> disorderly,
and I'm gonna be disorderly

00:14.581 --> 00:16.648
until my son's killer is found.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.183
Go ahead and
look at me!

00:18.185 --> 00:20.252
I'm a mother whose
son was killed,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.187
and these cops around
here don't give

00:22.189 --> 00:24.189
a good damn!
You. Hey.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.957
Look at me.
Are you a detective?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.259
Yeah, I'm a detective. Why?

00:27.261 --> 00:30.195
Well, I want you and all your
detective friends to know

00:30.197 --> 00:32.296
that I'm gonna stand
out here every day

00:32.299 --> 00:33.598
until someone
listens to me

00:33.600 --> 00:35.167
and finds out who
killed my boy,

00:35.169 --> 00:36.635
because I deserve
to know who...

00:36.637 --> 00:38.470
Okay. What's your
boy's name, ma'am?

00:38.472 --> 00:41.440
Amir Christopher Brown, and
it's been a hundred and for...

00:41.442 --> 00:43.442
146 days. I can see
the sign, ma'am,

00:43.444 --> 00:46.478
and I can hear you screaming--
I'll take a look at it.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.202
You'll "take a look"?

00:47.226 --> 00:48.881
What does that even mean,
you'll "take a look"?

00:48.882 --> 00:51.049
It means I'll take a look at it.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.952
It better mean you are going
to get justice for Amir,

00:53.954 --> 00:56.354
because tomorrow
is 147 days,

00:56.356 --> 00:59.091
and I will still be out
here demanding justice

00:59.093 --> 01:01.760
for my son!

01:01.762 --> 01:02.761
You gonna hit me?

01:02.763 --> 01:03.962
I didn't call
no cops!

01:03.964 --> 01:07.099
(all shouting)

01:07.101 --> 01:08.233
Central, 12-David, 10-84.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.335
Hey. Hey. Back up.
Hey! Back it up!

01:10.337 --> 01:11.636
(indistinct shouting)

01:11.638 --> 01:12.971
- Hey, calm down. Hey, calm down.
- Hey, hey.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.006
- What... Will you tell me what happened?
- He's a psycho!

01:15.008 --> 01:16.174
Calm down! Look, calm down!

01:16.176 --> 01:18.276
Get off me, man.
We got this.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.679
- Can you give us a hand with the crowd?
- Yeah, you got it. Eddie!

01:20.681 --> 01:22.280
Eddie, hey. All right,
everybody just back it up.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.448
Step back. Step back.
Step back.

01:23.450 --> 01:24.816
JANKO:
Please...

01:24.818 --> 01:26.084
(woman screams)

01:26.652 --> 01:28.019
Hey! You good?

01:28.021 --> 01:29.688
I'm good! Go, go.

01:30.389 --> 01:31.490
Hey! Police! Stop!

01:31.492 --> 01:32.390
Let's cut him off.

01:32.392 --> 01:35.193
♪ ♪

01:35.195 --> 01:36.194
Stop!

01:36.196 --> 01:37.395
Hold it right there!

01:37.397 --> 01:38.230
Police!

01:38.232 --> 01:40.732
Hey! Police!

01:45.538 --> 01:47.272
(Eddie shouts)

01:47.274 --> 01:49.040
DUNLEEVY:
Stop!

01:49.042 --> 01:50.475
Hey!

01:53.679 --> 01:55.147
(grunts)

01:57.150 --> 01:59.217
Eddie! Eddie!

02:00.486 --> 02:02.587
(gasping)

02:02.589 --> 02:05.757
You hit? Where you hit?
Where you hit?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.325
Where you hit?

02:11.564 --> 02:13.098
Didn't go through.
It didn't go through.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.332
It didn't go through.
You're all right.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.100
You're okay. Hang tight.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.735
MILLER:
He's hit!

02:19.238 --> 02:21.206
JAMIE:
Call a bus. Call a bus!

02:21.208 --> 02:24.309
Hey! Hey, Dunleevy, hey.
10-13.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.510
10-13, officer down.
Gunshots fired.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.912
Officer down!

02:26.914 --> 02:28.180
Hey, you all right?

02:28.182 --> 02:30.182
Hey, talk to me.
Dunleevy, stay with me.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.583
Hey, Andrew.
Hey, talk to me.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.785
Hey. Stay with me,
all right, bud?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.187
I remember this case.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.255
Amir Brown--
he was shot outside a nightclub

02:37.257 --> 02:38.824
in the, uh, Village, right?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.993
Yeah, at 3:00 a.m. on October 3
outside Bar Sixteen.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.729
Two shots to the chest
with a .45-caliber.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.699
What the hell are you doing?
You snooping around my case?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.968
Well, I didn't know
it was your case anymore.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.004
What are you talking about?
It's been open for 146 days,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.339
you haven't cracked it,

02:54.341 --> 02:56.241
and we got a mom who's
wondering who killed her son.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.610
Ah, she got to you, too, huh?
Let me tell you something,

02:58.612 --> 02:59.606
her son was a dirtbag.

02:59.630 --> 03:02.229
I didn't know we only
closed cases on vics we like.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.883
Son of a bitch. Why don't I take some
of your cases, would you like that?

03:04.885 --> 03:07.853
You couldn't, because I,
unlike you, close my cases.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.487
- Hey.
- Hey!

03:09.489 --> 03:10.956
You got a real problem, man.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.358
(shouting)
Break it up.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.492
Get your hands off me.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.560
You're a jag-off!

03:15.562 --> 03:17.329
Get off me!

03:19.031 --> 03:21.066
This is our squad!

03:22.335 --> 03:23.802
My case.

03:23.804 --> 03:28.039
GARRETT: Officer Andrew John Dunleevy
was shot and killed

03:28.041 --> 03:31.042
at approximately 9:45 a.m. today

03:31.044 --> 03:33.945
without provocation
and while performing his duties

03:33.947 --> 03:36.815
as a New York City
police officer.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.149
He was...

03:38.151 --> 03:41.353
on the job for five years
and was...

03:41.355 --> 03:44.122
an exemplary police officer.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.092
Our hearts and prayers and
gratitude for his service

03:47.094 --> 03:50.095
go out to his widow
Stephanie and his...

03:50.097 --> 03:51.830
children, Jason and Anne.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.166
Officer Edit Janko
was also hit with gunfire.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.435
Her bulletproof vest
saved her life.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.105
She is recovering
from blunt force trauma

04:00.107 --> 04:01.573
in the E.R.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.941
The shooter...

04:02.943 --> 04:06.511
Malcolm James, 21,
of East New York,

04:06.513 --> 04:09.447
is in custody
at this time.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.916
We'll take questions.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.317
Helen.

04:12.319 --> 04:15.220
Commissioner, what do we know
about the reason for the attack?

04:15.222 --> 04:18.723
Officers Dunleevy, Miller,
Reagan and Janko responded

04:18.725 --> 04:22.594
to a 911 call
about a domestic disturbance.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.896
Malcolm James, by all accounts,

04:24.898 --> 04:28.333
fired first and without warning.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.401
Robert.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.069
Has Malcolm James
made a statement?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.571
- Well...
- At this time, we know that

04:33.573 --> 04:37.042
the police responded
to a 911 call,

04:37.044 --> 04:39.978
which resulted
in this young man being pursued

04:39.980 --> 04:41.680
by our officers.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.548
And in answer to
your question,

04:43.550 --> 04:45.350
the investigation
is ongoing.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.851
Madame Mayor,
you're saying

04:46.853 --> 04:49.788
police were chasing the subject
at the time of the shooting?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.156
The suspect was running
from the cops?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.959
Perhaps he felt threatened.
We don't know.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.294
And as soon as we
ascertain the details...

04:56.296 --> 04:58.997
Then we will issue
a joint press release.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.231
But, Madame Mayor,
are you saying that

05:00.233 --> 05:01.666
Malcolm James fired because

05:01.668 --> 05:02.867
he was scared for his life?

05:02.869 --> 05:06.404
Listen, anyone,
especially a minority,

05:06.406 --> 05:08.306
being chased by police

05:08.308 --> 05:10.608
would be afraid for their life.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.577
So did he shoot at cops...
(reporters clamoring)

05:12.579 --> 05:15.080
GARRETT:
Hey, let's bring it back.

I don't think I even
need to be here.

05:58.427 --> 06:00.094
Hey.

06:00.096 --> 06:03.564
I got shot on patrol
in the vest once-- it hurt.

06:03.566 --> 06:05.833
Felt like
a sledgehammer hit me.

06:05.835 --> 06:07.901
Yeah, there's that.

06:07.903 --> 06:10.471
We got the shooter.

06:11.306 --> 06:12.940
I can I.D. him.

06:12.942 --> 06:14.742
He's not going anywhere.

06:14.744 --> 06:17.611
And neither are you until
the doctor says so. Copy?

06:17.613 --> 06:19.947
Copy that, sir.

06:19.949 --> 06:21.815
Good.

06:23.084 --> 06:24.184
(takes deep breath)

06:24.186 --> 06:27.454
And... you should
know one thing.

06:29.057 --> 06:32.359
My partner did
everything by the book.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.566
Thank you for that.

06:40.535 --> 06:42.136
And you should know

06:42.138 --> 06:46.340
that you can have your pick
of assignments after this.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.544
I'm happy exactly
where I am.

06:53.448 --> 06:55.115
Okay.

07:00.989 --> 07:02.623
Be well.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.358
Thank you, Commissioner.

07:11.900 --> 07:13.333
Just show me where he is.

07:13.335 --> 07:15.436
Don't tell me where
I can and cannot go.

07:16.771 --> 07:18.272
You said you'd
look into

07:18.274 --> 07:19.076
Amir's murder?

07:19.100 --> 07:20.708
Look, she said she had
an appointment with you.

07:20.709 --> 07:23.143
Sure. She has an appointment.

07:23.145 --> 07:25.712
Honestly, it's fine.

07:27.282 --> 07:28.982
So?

07:28.984 --> 07:30.651
So, why don't you have a seat.

07:30.653 --> 07:31.819
Please.

07:31.821 --> 07:34.021
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

07:34.023 --> 07:35.789
We were just looking
at the circumstances

07:35.791 --> 07:36.957
around your son's murder.

07:36.959 --> 07:38.659
Oh, I can tell you
the circumstances.

07:38.661 --> 07:39.827
It's that my son

07:39.829 --> 07:41.495
has a record,
and we don't live

07:41.497 --> 07:42.896
on the Upper East Side.
- Okay.

07:42.898 --> 07:44.131
Just hold on a minute.

07:44.133 --> 07:45.766
No, <i>you</i> hold on a minute.

07:45.768 --> 07:48.068
A cop was shot this morning,

07:48.070 --> 07:51.004
and his killer was behind
bars before lunchtime,

07:51.006 --> 07:53.974
because every single cop wanted
to catch the guy who killed him.

07:53.976 --> 07:55.175
What I want

07:55.177 --> 07:59.613
is for you to pretend that
my son wore a uniform.

07:59.615 --> 08:00.647
Listen...
Pretend my son

08:00.649 --> 08:03.550
was part of your NYPD <i>family.</i>

08:03.552 --> 08:04.785
Listen to me.

08:04.787 --> 08:07.154
I'm already going out
on a limb here, okay?

08:07.156 --> 08:09.122
Poking around
another detective's case

08:09.124 --> 08:10.824
because you asked me to.

08:10.826 --> 08:13.126
And your attitude about cops
is making me look like

08:13.128 --> 08:14.761
an even bigger ass.

08:14.763 --> 08:17.431
Now, could you just
tone it down, please?

08:17.433 --> 08:18.966
Please?

08:21.736 --> 08:23.003
Okay.

08:23.005 --> 08:24.538
Okay.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.476
Why don't we start...

08:29.478 --> 08:32.212
with you telling us whatever
you can about your son's murder.

08:32.214 --> 08:36.817
Amir was at that club with his
best friend, Jordan Robles.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.653
What, y-you're not
gonna write this down?

08:39.655 --> 08:42.022
Tell us the story first, please.

08:42.024 --> 08:45.292
They were out celebrating
Jordan's birthday.

08:45.294 --> 08:48.262
Jordan said he saw
the guy who shot Amir.

08:48.264 --> 08:50.297
He even identified him.

08:50.299 --> 08:51.765
He identified him

08:51.767 --> 08:53.467
to police?
- Yes.

08:53.469 --> 08:56.436
To police, who did nothing.

09:02.844 --> 09:04.111
Hey.

09:04.113 --> 09:06.847
Officer Janko, come on,
let's blow this joint.

09:06.849 --> 09:08.181
Jamie, hi.

09:08.183 --> 09:09.616
Came to drive you home.

09:10.552 --> 09:12.119
Hi.

09:12.654 --> 09:14.054
Hi.

09:14.056 --> 09:15.088
Jamie, Barry.

09:15.090 --> 09:16.123
Barry, Jamie.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.491
Hi.

09:17.493 --> 09:18.625
I'm Eddie's...
- Partner.

09:18.627 --> 09:20.427
Yeah, yeah, I know.
She told me all about you.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.929
Good to go?

09:21.931 --> 09:23.964
Yeah. Barry offered
to drive me home.

09:23.966 --> 09:25.165
Oh.

09:25.167 --> 09:26.466
So thanks anyway, Jamie.

09:26.468 --> 09:27.601
No problem.

09:27.603 --> 09:29.269
So, I'll grab the car,
pull up out front?

09:29.271 --> 09:30.237
Great.

09:30.239 --> 09:32.039
Good meeting you.
- Yeah.

09:35.043 --> 09:36.243
Barry.

09:36.245 --> 09:37.744
Yeah. I told you about him.

09:37.746 --> 09:39.746
He's, uh, the guy
who ghosted me.

09:39.748 --> 09:41.315
Turned out he
stopped calling me

09:41.317 --> 09:43.216
because I-I talked
about you too much.

09:43.218 --> 09:44.718
Oh, that's that guy.
- Yeah.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.020
He reached back out to me.

09:47.022 --> 09:49.089
Uh-huh.
And I explained to him

09:49.091 --> 09:50.757
that I only
talk about you so much

09:50.759 --> 09:52.626
'cause you're,
like, my work husband.

09:52.628 --> 09:55.062
I'll just... I'll see you.

09:56.197 --> 09:58.198
Okay.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.867
♪

10:00.869 --> 10:03.270
We was just having a fight...

10:03.272 --> 10:05.172
and she called the cops.

10:05.174 --> 10:06.673
That's it.

10:06.675 --> 10:07.995
I didn't do nothin' wrong.

10:07.996 --> 10:09.762
Except for kill
a police officer.

10:09.764 --> 10:10.819
We didn't need no cops there.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.833
Then why did your
girlfriend call 911?

10:12.834 --> 10:16.202
She was being dramatic, is all.

10:16.204 --> 10:17.770
Can you explain

10:17.772 --> 10:19.372
why you had an illegal weapon

10:19.374 --> 10:21.507
and opened fire on
the police officers?

10:21.509 --> 10:23.009
(knocking)

10:23.644 --> 10:24.977
Thank you.
Stop talking.

10:24.979 --> 10:27.313
Don't say another word.
What are you doing?

10:27.315 --> 10:30.249
I am advising my client
to stop answering questions.

10:30.251 --> 10:31.851
I'm his defense attorney.

10:38.158 --> 10:39.625
Jack?

10:39.627 --> 10:40.926
What the hell are you doing?

10:40.928 --> 10:42.228
My job.

10:42.230 --> 10:45.631
Oh, your job now is
to defend cop killers?

10:45.633 --> 10:49.068
Look, Erin,
it's an 18-B case,

10:49.070 --> 10:51.003
and it happens to be
my turn.

10:51.005 --> 10:53.673
Very sorry that we can't
all be perfect like you.

10:53.675 --> 10:56.075
At least I still
have scruples,

10:56.077 --> 10:57.777
and didn't sell
my soul for money.

10:57.779 --> 10:58.978
Right, because you just
sold your soul

10:58.980 --> 11:00.479
for a place at
family dinner, right?

11:00.481 --> 11:02.315
Because to sit
at that table,

11:02.317 --> 11:03.849
you have to subscribe
to Reagan's law,

11:03.851 --> 11:06.285
that all cops are
absolutely infallible.

11:06.287 --> 11:08.020
They may not be
infallible, Jack,

11:08.022 --> 11:11.290
but that father and husband
who devoted his life to service

11:11.292 --> 11:13.125
did not deserve
to be shot dead

11:13.127 --> 11:15.027
because he responded
to a call for help.

11:15.029 --> 11:16.962
Yeah, and the Erin
that I knew in college

11:16.964 --> 11:19.532
still believed that everybody
deserved a defense.

11:19.534 --> 11:21.434
'Cause in case
you haven't looked lately,

11:21.436 --> 11:23.235
justice still wears
a blindfold, Erin.

11:23.237 --> 11:25.037
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that, Jack,

11:25.039 --> 11:28.841
as you defend a thug who
just left two kids fatherless.

11:37.704 --> 11:39.350
Pat Russo wants
a meeting with you.

11:39.352 --> 11:40.819
Why's the PBA
getting involved?

11:40.821 --> 11:42.520
'Cause your cops are
pissed off, boss.

11:42.522 --> 11:44.774
GARRETT: My inbox is
exploding with requests

11:44.776 --> 11:46.676
for a response
to the mayor's remarks.

11:46.678 --> 11:48.344
How do you want
to handle this?

11:50.948 --> 11:54.283
I was wondering when
you were gonna chime in.

11:54.285 --> 11:57.920
Something occurred to me today.

11:57.922 --> 12:00.356
You are the only member
of this department

12:00.358 --> 12:02.225
to have presided over
a line of duty death

12:02.227 --> 12:04.327
as both the commissioner...

12:04.329 --> 12:06.329
and as
a fallen officer's father.

12:06.331 --> 12:09.465
(taps desk)
Meaning?

12:09.467 --> 12:13.836
That maybe you should hold off
meeting with the mayor, until...

12:13.838 --> 12:15.171
Until I'm calm.

12:18.475 --> 12:20.443
That'll be never.

12:21.845 --> 12:23.446
She's here, isn't she?

12:23.448 --> 12:25.147
I can make an excuse.

12:25.149 --> 12:27.650
(sighs)

12:27.652 --> 12:29.018
Let's have her.

12:33.790 --> 12:35.591
Try to remember
this is her first time

12:35.593 --> 12:37.059
dealing with a cop
shooting, Frank.

12:37.061 --> 12:39.729
Maybe you should let her talk
instead of you, boss.

12:46.970 --> 12:48.237
Madame Mayor.

12:52.342 --> 12:53.809
Thank you, Baker.

12:57.381 --> 12:59.348
Please.

12:59.859 --> 13:01.326
I know what you're
going to say.

13:01.328 --> 13:03.428
- No, you don't.
- I didn't choose my words right.

13:03.430 --> 13:06.031
Part of our job is
to choose our words right.

13:06.033 --> 13:07.532
I wasn't going
to place blame

13:07.534 --> 13:09.368
without a full
investigation.

13:09.370 --> 13:12.504
No one asked you
to open an investigation.

13:12.506 --> 13:14.906
Other people have that job.
Raising questions

13:14.908 --> 13:17.376
is essential at
getting at the truth.

13:17.378 --> 13:19.945
You can say I'm
biased against cops.

13:19.947 --> 13:21.380
I can say you're
biased for them.

13:21.382 --> 13:23.915
Oh, I am well aware
of an unearned bias

13:23.917 --> 13:25.150
against cops.

13:25.152 --> 13:28.487
I am also aware
of my bias towards cops,

13:28.489 --> 13:30.355
which is very well earned.

13:31.591 --> 13:34.926
Look...

13:34.928 --> 13:37.229
every case, every shooting
needs to be taken

13:37.231 --> 13:38.397
on its own merits.

13:38.399 --> 13:39.531
You didn't do that.

13:39.533 --> 13:42.401
I didn't say Officer Dunleevy
was at fault!

13:42.403 --> 13:45.971
You suggested the perp fired
because he felt threatened.

13:45.973 --> 13:47.873
I was trying to make sure

13:47.875 --> 13:50.909
there was no question
of wrongdoing.

13:50.911 --> 13:53.979
And in the process,
made cops into the bad guys.

13:53.981 --> 13:56.882
I was simply raising questions.

13:59.752 --> 14:01.019
Do you know where I was

14:01.021 --> 14:03.588
when my police officers
were getting shot?

14:03.590 --> 14:04.823
What does that have to do
with anything?

14:04.825 --> 14:06.892
In a meeting about use of force

14:06.894 --> 14:09.728
being at a record low.

14:13.533 --> 14:16.134
What am I supposed to do
with that, Frank?

14:16.136 --> 14:19.638
Well, I would like you
to put on an NYPD uniform

14:19.640 --> 14:21.239
and 20 pounds of equipment

14:21.241 --> 14:22.674
and a gun belt

14:22.676 --> 14:25.143
and run up six flights of stairs
to save a woman

14:25.145 --> 14:28.580
who is being beaten
by her boyfriend, and then,

14:28.582 --> 14:29.981
I would like you

14:29.983 --> 14:31.883
to be raked over the coals
for your effort.

14:31.885 --> 14:35.654
And then, when you have
that frame of reference,

14:35.656 --> 14:38.557
maybe we can talk.

14:38.559 --> 14:40.392
You think I should apologize.

14:40.394 --> 14:43.261
I think there are 35,000 cops
out there

14:43.263 --> 14:46.798
who have taken an oath
to service and self-sacrifice,

14:46.800 --> 14:49.468
and you called that service
into question.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.536
What do you think?

14:55.374 --> 14:58.343
I think I'm sick of this.

14:59.178 --> 15:03.281
(door opens, closes)

15:04.617 --> 15:06.718
Hey, Raines. Hey.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.053
What do you want?

15:08.055 --> 15:11.456
(sighs) Look, I know
I may have overstepped.

15:11.458 --> 15:12.457
You think?

15:12.459 --> 15:14.392
Okay, I did.

15:14.394 --> 15:16.328
But something
doesn't add up here.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.729
Hey, it's your case now.

15:17.731 --> 15:19.798
Not about the case. About you.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.867
Look, in the last year,
there's only one detective

15:21.869 --> 15:23.068
in the entire city

15:23.070 --> 15:24.669
with more felony collars
than me.

15:24.671 --> 15:26.004
And that's you.

15:26.006 --> 15:27.606
Yet you had a positive I.D.

15:27.608 --> 15:29.908
on the shooter,
and you didn't arrest him. Why?

15:29.910 --> 15:31.743
I did arrest the shooter.
Corey DaSilva.

15:31.745 --> 15:33.145
Then why the hell
is the case still open?

15:33.147 --> 15:35.013
We got a description
from Amir's friend.

15:35.015 --> 15:36.815
Brought him to the precinct
to get his statement,

15:36.817 --> 15:38.049
but one of the uniforms

15:38.051 --> 15:40.152
had already picked up DaSilva.
As soon as the witness

15:40.154 --> 15:42.187
saw DaSilva at the precinct,
he I.D.'d him as the shooter.

15:42.189 --> 15:44.089
(laughs): Then why the hell'd
you let him go?

15:44.091 --> 15:46.558
Because your sister
made me release him.

15:52.698 --> 15:54.800
Why the hell would
you release a killer?

15:54.802 --> 15:56.535
Good afternoon to you, too.

15:56.537 --> 15:57.969
Can you be more specific?

15:57.971 --> 15:59.404
Corey DaSilva.

15:59.406 --> 16:00.472
That was, uh,

16:00.474 --> 16:01.840
that was the Brown case.

16:01.842 --> 16:03.141
The Amir Brown case.

16:03.143 --> 16:04.576
I remember that case.

16:04.578 --> 16:07.078
- Amir's friend I.D.'d the shooter.
- Yeah, but DaSilva

16:07.080 --> 16:08.880
was already in the back seat
of the squad car

16:08.882 --> 16:10.415
when he was identified

16:10.417 --> 16:11.783
as the shooter.
So what?

16:11.785 --> 16:12.884
So identifying him

16:12.886 --> 16:14.486
while he's in the back seat
of a police car,

16:14.488 --> 16:15.754
already handcuffed,

16:15.756 --> 16:17.589
is suggestive. There's no way
I'd get a conviction.

16:17.591 --> 16:19.791
He identified him
as the shooter!

16:19.793 --> 16:20.959
Who the hell cares

16:20.961 --> 16:22.928
where it happened?
You still got to arrest the guy

16:22.930 --> 16:24.229
and put him before the judge!

16:24.231 --> 16:26.464
Let him decide
the technicalities.

16:26.466 --> 16:27.966
To what end, Danny?

16:27.968 --> 16:29.301
You and I both know
the detective

16:29.303 --> 16:31.102
should've thrown DaSilva
in a lineup.

16:31.104 --> 16:32.137
Why don't you just shut up.

16:32.139 --> 16:33.205
No, you shut up!
Hey! Hey!

16:33.207 --> 16:34.172
Don't tell me to shut up.

16:34.174 --> 16:35.540
I just told you to shut up.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.775
All right, stop it, guys!

16:36.777 --> 16:37.876
Stop it!

16:37.878 --> 16:40.412
You couldn't find any evidence
to corroborate?

16:40.414 --> 16:42.480
We got a warrant
for his apartment

16:42.482 --> 16:44.416
hoping to find the gun,
but it was clean.

16:44.418 --> 16:47.385
Oh, it was clean.
So you just walk away!

16:47.387 --> 16:49.621
Nobody walked away!
It's an open case,

16:49.623 --> 16:51.723
and it's your detective
who screwed it up!

16:51.725 --> 16:54.259
Why don't the two of you
take a walk down to the precinct

16:54.261 --> 16:56.628
and talk to
Amir Brown's mother,

16:56.630 --> 16:58.630
who stands outside in the cold
every single day

16:58.632 --> 17:01.967
just trying to get justice
for her dead son.

17:07.473 --> 17:08.740
Hello?

17:08.742 --> 17:09.974
Hey, Eddie, it's me.

17:09.977 --> 17:11.776
- Jamie?
- I texted you.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.345
Come on,
let's go get a couple drinks.

17:13.347 --> 17:16.181
- Um, I can't tonight.
- Come on.

17:16.183 --> 17:17.749
We should drink to your health.
Don't leave me hanging.

17:17.751 --> 17:19.150
I'm sorry, Jamie.

17:19.152 --> 17:21.019
Tonight's
really not a good night,

17:21.021 --> 17:23.221
but can I take a rain check?

17:24.123 --> 17:26.324
All right, sure. You got it.

17:53.252 --> 17:54.786
(knock at door)

17:54.788 --> 17:56.254
I told your assistant

17:56.256 --> 17:57.355
it was a no-go.

17:57.357 --> 17:58.890
Yeah, I got the message.
But you haven't heard

17:58.892 --> 18:00.525
what I'm proposing yet.

18:00.527 --> 18:02.560
Unless you're proposing
that Malcolm James pleads guilty

18:02.562 --> 18:06.064
and agrees to life in prison,
then it's a no-go.

18:06.066 --> 18:08.133
Listen, I know how you feel
about cop killers,

18:08.135 --> 18:09.401
and I feel the same way.

18:09.403 --> 18:12.537
But I also believe that everyone
deserves a fair trial.

18:12.539 --> 18:15.240
Oh, he'll get a fair trial,
and then he'll get life.

18:15.242 --> 18:18.243
Yeah, well,
there may be bigger fish here.

18:18.245 --> 18:20.378
What are you talking about?

18:20.380 --> 18:24.249
The 911 call that brought cops
to the location

18:24.251 --> 18:26.451
wasn't a domestic disturbance.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.686
It was staged.

18:27.688 --> 18:29.220
What? Why?
The real reason

18:29.222 --> 18:31.589
for the call
was to get cops to come

18:31.591 --> 18:32.857
to the housing project

18:32.859 --> 18:34.826
so that he could shoot
one of them.

18:34.828 --> 18:37.262
For what purpose?
New directive

18:37.264 --> 18:38.596
from the Double Treys.

18:38.598 --> 18:40.298
In order to join the gang,

18:40.300 --> 18:42.801
you have to shoot
a uniformed cop.

18:44.904 --> 18:47.105
(indistinct chatter)

18:57.016 --> 19:00.185
That must be the part of
the job that sucks the most.

19:04.056 --> 19:06.491
I don't know how he does it.

19:08.527 --> 19:12.464
And I know there's nothing
I can say or do

19:12.466 --> 19:16.134
that can really help, but...

19:18.938 --> 19:21.172
Thank you.

19:22.975 --> 19:24.843
If there's anything you need,

19:24.845 --> 19:26.878
please don't hesitate to ask.

19:28.681 --> 19:33.018
I think you would have been
really proud to know my husband.

19:34.820 --> 19:37.288
I'm sure of that.

I've had a lot of practice.

20:57.270 --> 20:59.305
Half the guys outside the
church turned their back

20:59.307 --> 21:00.706
when Mayor Dutton spoke.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.108
It's already all over the news.

21:02.110 --> 21:04.143
And if I didn't have
to sit inside beside you,

21:04.145 --> 21:05.745
I would've turned my
back on the mayor, too.

21:05.747 --> 21:09.315
Back when I wore this uniform,
it would've been unthinkable.

21:09.317 --> 21:13.586
Now with where cops stand,
not so much.

21:13.588 --> 21:16.288
I didn't sign up
to get trashed by the mayor.

21:17.491 --> 21:19.492
Ah, she was just pandering
to the media.

21:19.494 --> 21:21.060
She spoke out of
turn. I get it.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.495
But I do think
she did a good job

21:22.497 --> 21:24.463
speaking about Officer
Dunleevy today.

21:24.465 --> 21:26.766
Well, you know who I think
does a good job?

21:26.768 --> 21:28.367
The people who are
victims of crimes

21:28.369 --> 21:30.534
but can't find anyone
to hear their story.

21:30.558 --> 21:31.805
Like who?

21:31.806 --> 21:33.639
All right, you made
your point, Danny.

21:33.641 --> 21:34.974
DANNY:
I'm just saying,

21:34.976 --> 21:37.343
it's got to be very frustrating
for an everyday person

21:37.345 --> 21:39.545
like Janay Brown to see
her son get murdered

21:39.547 --> 21:41.714
a-and nobody will do
a damn thing about it.

21:41.716 --> 21:42.915
The charges weren't dropped

21:42.917 --> 21:44.683
because she wasn't
important enough.

21:44.685 --> 21:46.052
What are we talking about here?

21:46.054 --> 21:48.120
A murder about five months ago.

21:48.122 --> 21:49.355
The perp was identified

21:49.357 --> 21:50.890
while sitting
in the back of a patrol car,

21:50.892 --> 21:52.591
so we couldn't move forward.

21:52.593 --> 21:55.061
She's right. The I.D.
would've gotten thrown out.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.930
Yeah, but you could be damn sure
if Janay Brown was a-a cop

21:57.932 --> 22:00.633
or a friend of the mayor,
the case wouldn't be

22:00.635 --> 22:02.968
sitting around in a file
collecting dust somewhere.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.537
Somebody'd be working it.
What about you?

22:04.539 --> 22:06.238
I am working it.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.940
Well, then she did
find someone.

22:07.942 --> 22:10.509
Someone who's like a dog
with a bone.

22:11.711 --> 22:12.711
That's good, right?

22:12.713 --> 22:15.014
In a detective, it is.

22:25.459 --> 22:26.725
DANNY:
Hey.

22:26.727 --> 22:27.927
You on dish duty again?

22:27.929 --> 22:29.061
I thought it was Erin's turn.

22:29.063 --> 22:30.596
Yeah. Lost a bet.

22:30.598 --> 22:32.098
Again?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.766
She must be on a roll.

22:33.768 --> 22:35.401
That or I'm in a slump.

22:35.403 --> 22:38.037
Well, I kind of got that idea
at dinner.

22:38.039 --> 22:39.505
It's fine.

22:39.507 --> 22:40.940
Just frustrated is all.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.908
Me, too. I'm sure Erin is, too.

22:42.910 --> 22:44.710
Well, Erin doesn't have
to look a victim's mother

22:44.712 --> 22:45.911
in the eyes every day.

22:45.913 --> 22:49.415
I'm pretty sure she has
her own version of that.

22:49.417 --> 22:52.184
Fair enough.

22:52.186 --> 22:55.554
It's just I...
keep promising myself

22:55.556 --> 22:57.123
I'm not gonna let these cases
get to me.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.257
Then a case like this

22:58.259 --> 22:59.558
comes along,
like this one...

22:59.560 --> 23:00.926
I do the same thing.

23:00.928 --> 23:03.395
Promise myself I'm not gonna
get sucked into the politics

23:03.397 --> 23:05.264
and all of a sudden
I'm in the mud.

23:05.266 --> 23:07.933
Well, I guess it's a sucky week
for both of us.

23:07.935 --> 23:11.303
Not when you compare it
to your victim...

23:13.640 --> 23:15.975
...or my officer.

23:17.611 --> 23:19.979
ERIN:
So let me get this straight.

23:19.981 --> 23:23.816
The shooting of Officer Dunleevy
was part of a gang initiation.

23:23.818 --> 23:26.252
Yeah. You got to shoot a cop.

23:26.254 --> 23:27.253
Any cop?

23:27.255 --> 23:28.687
Any cop

23:28.689 --> 23:30.156
wearing an NYPD uniform.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.892
And it was necessary to get
into the Double Treys?

23:32.894 --> 23:36.829
I swear to God, I just wanted
to shoot him, not kill him.

23:36.831 --> 23:41.066
Well, I'm sure Mrs. Dunleevy
will be comforted by that.

23:41.068 --> 23:42.601
He's answered
all your questions.

23:42.603 --> 23:44.336
You can put him back in holding.

23:44.338 --> 23:46.172
Thank you.

23:50.844 --> 23:52.578
(door closes)

23:52.580 --> 23:56.282
Malcolm will get murder two,
25 years instead of life.

23:56.284 --> 23:58.417
I'll go after Martinez,
the leader of the Double Treys,

23:58.419 --> 23:59.518
for murder one.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.620
Sounds like a plan.

24:01.622 --> 24:03.822
And, Jack, I'm sorry
I judged you so harshly

24:03.824 --> 24:05.324
when you first took the case.

24:05.326 --> 24:06.926
That's okay.

24:06.928 --> 24:08.327
Kind of used to it.

24:10.263 --> 24:15.334
Got to admit, you usually accuse
first, ask questions later.

24:15.336 --> 24:17.903
Guilty.

24:17.905 --> 24:21.340
And, Jack, there is a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

24:23.476 --> 24:27.680
When you were in the hospital
after you were stabbed,

24:27.682 --> 24:30.349
you keep a wedding photo of us
in your wallet. Why?

24:30.351 --> 24:32.985
Oh, I haven't, uh,

24:32.987 --> 24:35.154
haven't gone through the photos
in my wallet in years.

24:36.189 --> 24:39.158
Just, uh, lazy, I guess.

24:45.465 --> 24:47.700
(door closes)

24:47.702 --> 24:51.136
So we know who the shooter is,
but we can't arrest him?

24:51.138 --> 24:52.638
It's hard enough
to find one witness.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.039
Now we're gonna have to find
another one.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.874
And on a case
that's five months old.

24:55.876 --> 24:57.576
Do we got the security footage?

25:06.019 --> 25:08.420
What happens
when you zoom in?

25:08.422 --> 25:10.656
TARU already had a crack at it.
It's too blurry.

25:10.658 --> 25:12.358
There aren't even any markings
on his sweatshirt

25:12.360 --> 25:15.060
or jeans. Nothing.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.597
What about the time stamp?

25:18.599 --> 25:21.367
It's, uh, 3:05 a.m. Why?

25:23.903 --> 25:25.571
Oh.

25:25.573 --> 25:27.072
Is that bull's-eye
Jack Boyle?

25:27.074 --> 25:30.342
No. He actually redeemed
himself this time.

25:32.078 --> 25:34.380
You ever wonder what would
have happened if you two...

25:34.382 --> 25:36.181
No.

25:36.183 --> 25:37.816
No regrets?

25:37.818 --> 25:40.352
No. You don't regret the great
relationships that failed.

25:40.354 --> 25:42.588
You regret the ones you never
followed through on.

25:42.590 --> 25:44.089
Mm-hmm.

25:44.091 --> 25:45.357
How's Eddie?

25:45.359 --> 25:47.493
I think this whole thing
scared me more than her.

25:47.495 --> 25:49.795
Well, that's understandable
given the history.

25:49.797 --> 25:50.963
She was even fighting

25:50.965 --> 25:53.032
the doctor at the hospital
about staying overnight.

25:53.034 --> 25:54.967
Well, that's just
survivor's guilt.

25:54.969 --> 25:56.635
I'm feeling
pretty guilty, too.

25:56.637 --> 25:59.171
It's not your fault.

25:59.173 --> 26:00.506
There's no way
you could've known.

26:00.508 --> 26:04.276
I'm feeling guilty
because when I saw

26:04.278 --> 26:08.013
Dunleevy lying there and...

26:08.015 --> 26:09.748
I knew he was dead

26:09.750 --> 26:11.684
and she wasn't,

26:11.686 --> 26:16.288
I actually thought to myself,
I'm glad it's him and not Eddie.

26:17.891 --> 26:19.758
That tell you anything?

26:19.760 --> 26:21.894
That I care about my partner?

26:23.730 --> 26:25.531
What if it was Eddie?

26:25.533 --> 26:27.966
It wasn't. Is there something
that you're trying to say?

26:27.968 --> 26:31.670
Maybe. I'm not sure
you want to hear it.

26:31.672 --> 26:33.439
Try me.

26:33.441 --> 26:36.408
I've seen you
guys together

26:36.410 --> 26:41.113
and what I see is more
than just patrol partners.

26:41.115 --> 26:42.948
Okay, what is it
you think you're seeing?

26:42.950 --> 26:44.883
I think what everyone sees.

26:44.885 --> 26:48.620
Two people who seem
to belong together.

26:48.622 --> 26:50.656
There's a line in the sand.
- Why?

26:50.658 --> 26:52.224
Because you guys are partners?

26:52.226 --> 26:53.826
Starting with that, yeah.

26:53.828 --> 26:56.228
Well, I always thought
it was a line in the sand

26:56.230 --> 26:58.130
because it's so easy to erase.

26:58.132 --> 26:59.832
Consider this.

26:59.834 --> 27:03.802
What if it was Eddie
that had been killed?

27:03.804 --> 27:06.972
Is there anything you would
regret for the rest of your life

27:06.974 --> 27:08.907
'cause you never told her?

27:08.909 --> 27:11.176
♪ ♪

27:15.115 --> 27:17.383
If you remember anything,
please, just give me a call.

27:17.385 --> 27:20.052
Okay? Thank you.

27:20.054 --> 27:21.387
(women laughing)

27:21.389 --> 27:24.189
Ladies. Good evening.

27:24.191 --> 27:26.158
Detective Reagan, NYPD.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.293
Was wondering if any of you
recognize this man.

27:28.295 --> 27:30.629
- No.
- He was murdered on this block

27:30.631 --> 27:33.499
about five months ago,
right around this time of night.

27:33.501 --> 27:35.334
- Here?
- Yeah.

27:35.336 --> 27:36.468
Wondering if you
might've saw something

27:36.470 --> 27:37.436
or could recall anything.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.471
No. Sorry.
- All right.

27:39.473 --> 27:41.440
If you think of anything at all,
please give me a call.

27:41.442 --> 27:42.608
My number's at the bottom.

27:42.610 --> 27:44.476
Okay. Thank you.

27:44.478 --> 27:46.178
Get home safe.

27:46.180 --> 27:49.381
He was kind of cute.
(laughs)

27:49.383 --> 27:50.849
One of them thought
you were cute.

27:50.851 --> 27:52.251
Guess that's what happens

27:52.253 --> 27:53.652
when it's 3:00 a.m.
and you're drunk.

27:53.654 --> 27:55.320
What the hell are
you doing out here?

27:55.322 --> 27:57.322
I could ask you
the same question.

27:57.324 --> 27:59.825
What do you think, coming
back here at the same time

27:59.827 --> 28:02.127
to the same street,
gonna find a Good Samaritan

28:02.129 --> 28:04.496
that's gonna break
open our case?

28:04.498 --> 28:05.564
Maybe I will.

28:05.566 --> 28:06.698
And it's not your case.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.534
You dropped the
ball, remember?

28:08.536 --> 28:10.736
Excuse me, sir.

28:10.738 --> 28:12.638
Sir.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.306
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective...

28:14.308 --> 28:15.741
Detective ABETEMARCO.

28:15.743 --> 28:17.109
Detective Abbot
and Costello.

28:17.111 --> 28:19.244
There was a murder out here
around five months ago.

28:19.246 --> 28:21.180
I already talked to the cops
when it happened.

28:21.182 --> 28:22.981
Okay, well, I'm
recanvassing the area.

28:22.983 --> 28:24.116
ABETEMARCO:
<i>We're</i> recanvassing.

28:24.118 --> 28:25.918
Did you see anything?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.419
I heard a gunshot.

28:27.421 --> 28:28.487
When I came out,

28:28.489 --> 28:29.988
I saw a guy lying
in the street.

28:29.990 --> 28:31.623
Another one running away
with a gun in his hand.

28:31.625 --> 28:33.625
You see his face?
He had a hood up.

28:33.627 --> 28:35.828
Which way'd they run?
He ran that way.

28:35.830 --> 28:38.430
That way up the street?
Did he stop at all?

28:38.432 --> 28:39.631
Yeah. He stopped about halfway
up the block.

28:39.633 --> 28:41.633
Whereabouts?
- By the hydrant.

28:41.635 --> 28:43.202
DANNY:
The hydrant? Okay.

28:43.204 --> 28:45.237
Do you have any idea why he
stopped? Did he do anything?

28:45.239 --> 28:46.371
I'm not a mind reader.

28:46.373 --> 28:48.073
It was dark,
like tonight.

28:48.075 --> 28:49.741
I couldn't see,
but he just kept going.

28:49.743 --> 28:51.743
Okay. Thank you.

28:51.745 --> 28:53.779
Hey, any idea
why he killed that kid?

28:53.781 --> 28:56.215
Well, I'm not
a mind reader.

29:01.454 --> 29:03.121
Ah.

29:05.158 --> 29:06.391
Thinking what
I'm thinking?

29:06.393 --> 29:08.293
I sure hope I ain't

29:08.295 --> 29:10.929
thinking what
you're thinking.

29:23.810 --> 29:26.812
Why is that when the two of you
try to work together,

29:26.814 --> 29:28.647
it always ends
in you-know-what?

29:28.649 --> 29:29.781
I told you to wear boots.

29:29.783 --> 29:31.149
I didn't think
it'd be like this.

29:31.151 --> 29:33.085
What? Disgusting?
Smelly? Slimy?

29:33.087 --> 29:35.454
Do you mind stepping aside?
Thank you.

29:36.222 --> 29:38.357
Who said police work
was glamorous?

29:38.359 --> 29:39.525
Actually, no one ever.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.393
- Ugh.
- We're pariahs in our own precinct.

29:41.395 --> 29:44.129
Now we have to go through
a year's worth

29:44.131 --> 29:45.330
of smelly sewage?
- (coughs)

29:45.332 --> 29:46.765
Remind me again
why we're doing this.

29:46.767 --> 29:48.634
Because him and my
sister screwed up.

29:48.636 --> 29:50.469
- You know what I like about you?
- What?

29:50.471 --> 29:51.436
Nothing.

29:51.438 --> 29:53.972
Why are you even here?

29:53.974 --> 29:55.307
To get you off my case.

29:55.309 --> 29:56.241
Why are you here?

29:56.243 --> 29:57.809
(coughs)
I'm here so Janay Brown

29:57.811 --> 29:59.044
doesn't have
to add another day

29:59.046 --> 30:01.647
to her son's poster.

30:01.649 --> 30:03.949
Ooh. And...

30:06.252 --> 30:08.220
...to find the murder weapon.

30:08.222 --> 30:09.788
There you go.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.941
- And what do you suggest I do, Garrett?
- I suggest

30:22.942 --> 30:25.129
you make sure we don't have
our cops turning their back

30:25.131 --> 30:26.597
on the mayor.
- You mean order it?

30:26.599 --> 30:27.631
Whatever it takes.

30:27.633 --> 30:28.599
Well, that's not the message

30:28.601 --> 30:30.568
I want them
to receive right now.

30:30.570 --> 30:32.336
Well, what message
are you looking to send?

30:32.338 --> 30:34.438
That it's open season
on the mayor?

30:34.440 --> 30:36.607
- She brought this on herself.
- Maybe.

30:36.609 --> 30:38.976
But in case you haven't noticed,
the press is making this

30:38.978 --> 30:41.278
about you versus her.
- Look, I get it.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.846
I-I'd like to give her my back,
too, but...

30:42.848 --> 30:45.616
But how you feel
and how you act

30:45.618 --> 30:46.917
need to be two
different things.

30:46.919 --> 30:48.519
Cops don't get to have a voice?

30:48.521 --> 30:50.187
Boss, when I first started
on this job,

30:50.189 --> 30:52.489
you told me how I feel
is not the point;

30:52.491 --> 30:54.925
how I understand the job
<i>is</i> the point.

30:54.927 --> 30:57.361
Are you really gonna throw
my words back at me?

30:57.363 --> 30:58.662
Yep.

30:58.664 --> 31:00.064
I don't need to tell you
that you make decisions

31:00.066 --> 31:01.966
all the time that you hate.

31:01.968 --> 31:03.801
This is not a policy decision,
Garrett.

31:03.803 --> 31:05.235
It's about a fallen officer.

31:05.237 --> 31:06.804
Right now,
it's about this department

31:06.806 --> 31:09.573
and how it's being portrayed and
what message we want to send.

31:09.575 --> 31:10.774
The message is simple.

31:10.776 --> 31:12.843
Don't trash cops.

31:12.845 --> 31:16.413
That message
has been sent, boss.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.821
(whirring)

31:27.025 --> 31:28.292
Hi.

31:28.294 --> 31:29.994
- Hi.
- The, uh...

31:29.996 --> 31:32.129
the sentencing hearing
for Malcolm James

31:32.131 --> 31:33.664
is set for tomorrow at 10:00.

31:33.666 --> 31:36.100
And you came all the way
down here to tell me that?

31:36.102 --> 31:40.904
No, I came down here
to tell you that I lied.

31:40.906 --> 31:43.273
What are you talking about?

31:45.410 --> 31:47.745
The reason I carry
our wedding photo...

31:49.581 --> 31:52.383
Um... uh, it's kind of
the same reason

31:52.385 --> 31:55.552
that I carry a picture
of Nicky when she was six.

31:55.554 --> 31:57.021
I'd come home,

31:57.023 --> 32:01.025
and she would run--
I mean, run--

32:01.027 --> 32:03.260
into my arms full force,

32:03.262 --> 32:05.829
and she would wrap
herself around me.

32:05.831 --> 32:08.499
And I didn't know it then,

32:08.501 --> 32:10.968
but that was
the time of my life.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.970
And the wedding photo?

32:12.972 --> 32:16.607
Uh, we were in love

32:16.609 --> 32:20.644
and everything was great

32:20.646 --> 32:25.115
and it was like we were exactly
where we were supposed to be.

32:26.951 --> 32:30.054
And then life got in the way.

32:30.056 --> 32:31.689
Yeah, then the, uh,

32:31.691 --> 32:34.958
the divorce and
everything else aside,

32:34.960 --> 32:38.562
that day was a, was a
pretty great memory.

32:38.564 --> 32:40.130
Except for Aunt Edna.

32:40.132 --> 32:42.399
(both laugh)

32:42.401 --> 32:46.804
Yeah... Well, she gave everyone
something to talk about.

32:46.806 --> 32:49.273
Oh, and something to see.
I haven't quite forgotten it.

32:49.275 --> 32:51.275
Yeah, she retired
the tassels after that.

32:51.277 --> 32:53.844
Well, I should hope so.
She was 80.

32:53.846 --> 32:56.013
(laughs)

32:59.284 --> 33:01.318
We work well together.

33:04.823 --> 33:07.725
We're-we're good partners.

33:07.727 --> 33:09.560
You can't deny that.

33:11.362 --> 33:14.231
You're the best partner
I ever had,

33:14.233 --> 33:17.601
and the worst partner
I ever had.

33:18.570 --> 33:20.704
You want to focus on the
first part of that?

33:20.706 --> 33:23.107
(chuckles)

33:23.109 --> 33:24.675
What are you doing tonight?

33:24.677 --> 33:27.911
Mm...

33:27.913 --> 33:29.713
Um...

33:29.715 --> 33:33.517
I am running off to a little
island for some R and R.

33:33.519 --> 33:35.686
Ah, let me guess, Staten Island?

33:35.688 --> 33:38.388
Mm-hmm. I need to be
at Danny's by 8:00.

33:38.390 --> 33:41.191
Okay.

33:56.908 --> 33:58.475
DANNY:
153 days

33:58.477 --> 34:00.577
is a long time.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.648
You can retire that number.

34:06.184 --> 34:09.620
We arrested Corey DaSilva
for the murder of your son.

34:12.090 --> 34:13.857
Oh, my God.

34:13.859 --> 34:15.859
The charges are gonna
stick this time.

34:15.860 --> 34:18.462
We got the gun he used,
his prints are on it.

34:31.976 --> 34:35.179
It's been about 11 months
since I lost my wife.

34:35.181 --> 34:37.815
So you know?

34:37.817 --> 34:39.783
Yeah, I know.

34:44.922 --> 34:47.357
Maybe you can take
some of that energy

34:47.359 --> 34:49.693
and turn it into something
positive for Amir.

34:49.695 --> 34:50.928
What do you mean?

34:50.929 --> 34:54.598
My wife started doing
family game nights

34:54.600 --> 34:56.900
once a month
before she died.

34:56.902 --> 34:59.269
It was open invitation,
anyone in the family could come.

34:59.271 --> 35:03.507
And each game night, somebody
else got to pick the game.

35:03.509 --> 35:06.577
First game night
after she died, it was...

35:08.646 --> 35:10.080
...it was painful.

35:10.082 --> 35:13.217
I wanted to do it...

35:13.219 --> 35:16.587
you know,
keep doing it

35:16.589 --> 35:20.557
'cause it's what she
would've wanted and...

35:20.559 --> 35:22.326
I'm glad I did.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.661
Maybe you can
think of something

35:24.663 --> 35:26.296
that Amir would've
wanted you to do

35:26.298 --> 35:30.334
and continue doing,
even without him.

35:30.336 --> 35:34.037
Yeah.

35:37.041 --> 35:40.711
I think he'd say,
"You're a pretty good

35:40.713 --> 35:44.014
damn detective."

35:44.016 --> 35:47.184
And I'd agree.

36:05.036 --> 36:06.203
You're back.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.438
Hey. Uh, no,

36:08.440 --> 36:11.141
just... just,
uh, paperwork.

36:11.143 --> 36:14.611
And I-I had to get
fitted for a new vest.

36:18.049 --> 36:19.983
How you doing?

36:19.985 --> 36:23.220
I'm sore. I'm good.

36:24.956 --> 36:25.923
You miss me?

36:25.925 --> 36:28.592
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I did. Yeah.

36:28.594 --> 36:29.793
Having you gone
has actually gotten me

36:29.795 --> 36:30.861
thinking about a lot of things.

36:30.863 --> 36:33.430
(chuckles)
What were you thinking about?

36:33.432 --> 36:35.265
Hey.

36:35.267 --> 36:37.734
Eddie, you almost...
Oh, hey.

36:37.736 --> 36:39.703
- Hey.
- How you doing? Good?

36:39.705 --> 36:40.737
Good, yeah. You?

36:40.739 --> 36:42.172
Yeah. Good.

36:42.174 --> 36:45.008
Maybe we could all
go grab a bite to eat.

36:45.010 --> 36:46.643
Um, you're not working
a double, are you?

36:46.645 --> 36:48.812
No, but I...
We can't tonight.

36:48.814 --> 36:50.580
Why not?

36:50.582 --> 36:53.016
I only got two tickets
to <i>Springsteen on Broadway.</i>

36:53.018 --> 36:54.284
Oh, my God, are you serious?

36:54.286 --> 36:55.986
Tonight. Fourth row.

36:55.988 --> 36:57.854
I have been trying to
get tickets to that forever.

36:57.856 --> 37:00.057
I know. Anyway...

37:00.059 --> 37:02.326
Uh, sorry, maybe we can
do dinner another night?

37:02.328 --> 37:03.694
Yeah, sure, no problem.

37:03.696 --> 37:06.630
Great. I'll get us a cab,
meet you outside.

37:06.632 --> 37:07.664
Okay.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.633
Good seeing you.

37:09.635 --> 37:11.268
What were you gonna say?

37:11.270 --> 37:13.437
Uh, it was nothing.
You should get going.

37:13.439 --> 37:16.606
No. Tell me.
I really want to know.

37:16.608 --> 37:19.409
Just that...

37:19.411 --> 37:23.046
I hope you come back soon,
and enjoy that show

37:23.048 --> 37:24.982
because I'm jealous.

37:26.017 --> 37:28.418
All right?

37:46.237 --> 37:50.474
There's no winning.
- Nope.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.476
You're a winner
in one room

37:52.478 --> 37:55.212
and the next room,
they want to string you up.

37:55.214 --> 37:56.713
It's a vibrant city.

37:56.715 --> 37:58.148
Look.

37:58.150 --> 38:01.485
You win the job,
but then you have to do the job.

38:01.487 --> 38:04.621
And it's not so much
about winning as managing--

38:04.623 --> 38:06.423
the losses, the expectations.

38:06.425 --> 38:08.792
I hate the job, Frank.

38:08.794 --> 38:10.594
Well, I kind of gathered that.

38:10.596 --> 38:12.029
I mean, I didn't
even win it.

38:12.031 --> 38:14.765
It's not like I pointed
my life at it.

38:14.767 --> 38:17.134
Well, some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

38:17.136 --> 38:19.136
some have greatness
thrust upon them.

38:19.138 --> 38:20.804
Churchill?
Shakespeare.

38:20.806 --> 38:24.207
I'm feeling like
none of the above.

38:26.677 --> 38:29.479
I'm genuinely sorry
to hear that.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.680
I am.

38:30.682 --> 38:32.349
It's...

38:32.351 --> 38:34.684
It just isn't me.

38:34.686 --> 38:36.386
I never wanted to be mayor.

38:36.388 --> 38:38.622
I liked being public advocate,

38:38.624 --> 38:42.626
fighting for the underdog,
opening schools...

38:42.628 --> 38:45.295
The mayor can have
a hand in that, too.

38:45.297 --> 38:48.865
All I've done lately
is put my foot in it

38:48.867 --> 38:51.668
and piss off a lot of people,
including you.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.403
I don't hold a grudge.

38:53.405 --> 38:55.205
Your cops do.

38:55.207 --> 38:57.074
Ah, they'll forget about it.

38:57.076 --> 38:59.076
Part of what we love most
about the job

38:59.078 --> 39:01.211
is there's always
a fresh pain in the ass

39:01.213 --> 39:02.879
just around the corner.

39:02.881 --> 39:05.582
I do not want to be
the target of protests.

39:05.584 --> 39:07.651
I want to be
the one leading them.

39:09.954 --> 39:11.888
You're thinking about quitting.

39:13.925 --> 39:16.560
I'll stay until the election.

39:20.798 --> 39:24.501
You are one of the most genuine,

39:24.503 --> 39:27.037
honest people I've ever met.

39:28.372 --> 39:32.109
Total pain in my ass,
but you are a good guy.

39:32.111 --> 39:35.245
Thank you, I think.

39:35.247 --> 39:36.913
Except for you,

39:36.915 --> 39:39.549
there is nothing

39:39.551 --> 39:41.651
about this job
I'm going to miss.

39:41.653 --> 39:43.520
Not even the
free transportation?

39:43.522 --> 39:46.990
The first thing I do
after the election

39:46.992 --> 39:50.060
is I'm gonna take a walk
in Central Park by myself.

39:51.996 --> 39:55.599
Well, maybe I'll ask the
police commissioner to join me.

39:58.436 --> 40:02.439
He's very good
at ditching his detail.

40:02.441 --> 40:05.509
I'll miss working
with you, Frank.

40:05.511 --> 40:07.511
And Madame Mayor...

40:09.113 --> 40:12.048
I will miss working for you.

40:12.050 --> 40:15.552
How come I always felt it was
the other way around?

40:27.765 --> 40:29.699
Um... January.

40:29.701 --> 40:30.767
This is so easy.
- Uh...

40:30.769 --> 40:31.868
- New Year's, New Year's.
- Winter.

40:31.870 --> 40:33.069
What comes
after New Year?

40:33.071 --> 40:35.038
Oh, this is easy.
New Year's Day.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.640
No. What you do... New Year...

40:36.642 --> 40:38.441
Oh, resolutions.

40:38.443 --> 40:39.509
New Year's resolution!

40:39.511 --> 40:40.944
Resolutions.
- Yes!

40:40.946 --> 40:43.380
We win this round, we win the
whole thing, so pay attention.

40:43.382 --> 40:44.948
NICKY: Okay, just go, you're making me nervous.
- Okay, okay.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.783
So... y-y-you type
on this thing.

40:46.785 --> 40:48.451
An iPad?
- NICKY: A phone?

40:48.453 --> 40:50.720
No. You, like, type, like,
a project, like a book.

40:50.722 --> 40:52.522
- What?
- It's a... you put it on your lap.

40:52.524 --> 40:53.456
- Oh.
SEAN: Laptop?

40:53.458 --> 40:54.491
NICKY:
No, computer.
