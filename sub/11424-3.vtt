We're good. We're good.

Here we go here. I need
something to put here.

[Air hissing]

25:27.424 --> 25:29.358
Yes.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.526
Come on.

25:32.929 --> 25:36.265
Oh-oh, whoa. Who is that?

25:36.267 --> 25:37.799
- Who is that?!
- Come on!

25:41.338 --> 25:44.173
Guys! Let's go!

25:58.389 --> 25:59.921
Get off. I got it. I got it.

25:59.923 --> 26:01.556
Come on!

26:03.193 --> 26:04.993
Come on, guys. Come on.

26:09.399 --> 26:10.999

Push it through.

26:14.004 --> 26:15.536
Push it through.

26:15.538 --> 26:17.739
Pope, it's not gonna fit. Let's just go.

26:17.741 --> 26:19.273
- They're coming, man.
- We're gonna make it bigger.

26:19.275 --> 26:20.775
Use the saw, make it bigger.

26:20.777 --> 26:22.243
You want me to cut this
wire? I'm not gonna cut...

26:22.245 --> 26:24.445
I want you to cut the
wire. You will cut the wire!

26:24.447 --> 26:26.981
- Come on, they're coming!
- They're coming, Pope!

26:26.983 --> 26:28.149
Let's go!

[Power tool whirring]

26:37.927 --> 26:39.793

[Groans]

27:15.329 --> 27:17.630
That's your brilliant idea?!

27:17.632 --> 27:19.398
A goddamn burrito?

27:19.400 --> 27:20.933
We got through it, didn't we?

27:20.935 --> 27:22.701
That's what you're doing now?

27:22.703 --> 27:24.370
You're going behind my
back, running shit for Marco now?

27:24.372 --> 27:26.272
- Is that it?
- It was a gift!

27:26.274 --> 27:27.807
Just because you can't see the strings,

27:27.809 --> 27:29.408
it doesn't mean there aren't any!

27:29.410 --> 27:30.910
Flush it!

27:30.912 --> 27:32.912
When's Smurf gonna pay us again?

27:32.914 --> 27:34.180
- Craig, we...
- Do you know?

27:34.182 --> 27:36.415
We have to be smart right now. Smart!

27:36.417 --> 27:37.516
Don't you see that?

27:37.518 --> 27:39.351
She destroyed the watches.

27:39.353 --> 27:42.421
She's barely giving
us enough to live on.

27:42.423 --> 27:45.557
Flush it. I'm not driving till you do.

27:45.559 --> 27:49.828
Craig, flush it!

27:49.830 --> 27:51.263
I can sell it to Renn.

27:51.265 --> 27:54.667
We can pocket the
cash, and no one has to know.

27:54.669 --> 27:58.904
You've got Cath and Lena.

27:58.906 --> 28:00.572
Baz.

28:04.144 --> 28:06.144
What was she wearing?

28:06.146 --> 28:08.414
Um, she had j-jean shorts

28:08.416 --> 28:11.517
and a little, like, a
pink... a pink hoodie.

28:11.519 --> 28:13.084
Do you have a recent photograph?

28:13.086 --> 28:15.887
We may need something to circulate.

28:15.889 --> 28:17.423

What do you think, J?
We split this two ways.

29:03.903 --> 29:05.202
Deran can keep the porn.

29:05.204 --> 29:06.267
[Laughs mockingly]

29:06.411 --> 29:08.038
Yeah, if you had
actually cased the place...

29:08.040 --> 29:10.140
The job was solid. We had time.

29:10.142 --> 29:13.010
I'm sorry. You're on parole, idiot.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.845
You get caught, it's a twenty-year bid.

29:14.847 --> 29:15.880
I was looking out for you.

Yeah.

29:23.155 --> 29:25.189
He's just as stupid as you are, man.

29:25.191 --> 29:26.757
What? You really
want to go back to prison

29:26.759 --> 29:28.324
for... for... for 10 grand?

Some of us aren't
looking to suck off Mommy's tit

29:30.929 --> 29:33.129
for the rest of our lives.

29:33.131 --> 29:34.631
You could have fooled me.

Go ahead.

- Okay, J.
- If you really want to.

29:53.852 --> 29:55.251
Deran, you should thank him.

Oh, yeah? You should say, "Thank you, J,

29:57.456 --> 30:00.188
for actually having some genuine balls."

30:00.190 --> 30:03.191
Go on. It can't be that hard.

Say, "Thank you, J, for
actually having some balls."

actually having some balls.

Shut up, Pope!

Where is she?

She's in my room. We're playing dress-up.

30:29.219 --> 30:31.219
Are you out of your mind?

30:31.221 --> 30:33.456
You kidnapped my child.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.989

30:34.991 --> 30:36.891
a grocery store all by herself.

30:36.893 --> 30:38.192
Krystal was right there.

30:38.194 --> 30:40.628
The only thing your
friend Krystal is good for

30:40.630 --> 30:44.031
is finding drunk assholes to
beat the shit out of her.

Forgive me for
trying to protect my family.

30:46.870 --> 30:49.236
Not your family. Mine.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.805
We don't belong to you.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.675
You know, no matter how
much you take from us,

30:53.677 --> 30:56.711
you never really did want to
be a part of this family.

pimply-faced little girl

like a homeless puppy.

as she grows a pair of tits.

you always dreamed of.

anything the other day.

dad was a selfish prick.

36:18.062 --> 36:21.797
Well, um, I missed two hours of work,

36:21.799 --> 36:23.633
and the asshole docked my pay,

and my daughter had to
sleep in a bar, so...

Let's go. Prove it.

38:17.579 --> 38:20.647
Let's see it. Prove it, man.

38:20.649 --> 38:22.882
Let's go! Let's see what he got!

38:22.884 --> 38:24.517
There you go.

38:25.954 --> 38:27.721
[Both inhale deeply]

39:13.301 --> 39:16.502
[Dramatic music plays]

39:47.500 --> 39:49.667
[Coughing]

39:57.776 --> 40:00.177
[Panting]

40:15.365 --> 40:18.332
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

40:24.607 --> 40:27.475
I don't think the pills are working.

40:27.477 --> 40:31.245
At least he's not naked in
the backyard howling at the moon.

40:31.247 --> 40:32.580
Are you sure he's eating the food?

40:32.582 --> 40:33.549
He's eating.

40:33.706 --> 40:35.182
'Cause he's
complaining about his stomach.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.617
I lowered the dose.

40:36.619 --> 40:39.353
It takes a few days to kick in.

40:43.993 --> 40:46.126
So what happened with Cath?

40:46.128 --> 40:49.062
You know how she is.

40:49.064 --> 40:54.201
The girl's never been smart enough
to see the big picture.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.703
I was only trying to make
things easier for her,

40:56.705 --> 40:58.571
like we always have.

40:58.573 --> 41:02.041
This time she seemed...

41:02.043 --> 41:04.377
What?

41:04.379 --> 41:06.346
Never mind.

41:06.348 --> 41:08.448
No. What? She almost seemed what?

41:08.450 --> 41:11.685
Ungrateful.

41:23.565 --> 41:25.665
Hey, is Nicky here?

41:27.602 --> 41:29.369
It's a little late, don't you think?

41:29.371 --> 41:31.337
Yeah, I'm sorry. I, um...

41:31.339 --> 41:32.939
I just wanted to give her this.

41:32.941 --> 41:35.641
She thought she lost it, so...

41:35.643 --> 41:39.145
Look, Josh, I don't feel comfortable

41:39.147 --> 41:41.147
with you giving Nicky expensive gifts.

41:41.149 --> 41:42.432
I mean, I don't know where you got that,

41:42.434 --> 41:44.116
and frankly, I
don't really want to know.

41:44.118 --> 41:45.718
It was just...

41:45.720 --> 41:48.387
It was my mom's.

41:48.389 --> 41:51.690
It's the only nice
thing she really ever had.

41:53.494 --> 41:56.195
I'm sorry. I'll go get her.

41:56.197 --> 41:57.529
No. It's okay. Um...

41:57.531 --> 42:00.099
I got to go, so could you...

42:00.101 --> 42:02.634
Just tell her I'll see her around.

42:14.982 --> 42:17.215
[Video-game gunfire]

42:22.789 --> 42:24.189
Where is he?

42:24.191 --> 42:26.724
- Who?
- J.

42:26.726 --> 42:28.826
How should I know?

42:28.828 --> 42:30.595
Oh, I got the rent from Tao.

42:30.597 --> 42:32.898
He said he's sorry it was so late.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.966
His backpack is gone!

42:34.968 --> 42:37.568
All his clothes are gone!

42:37.570 --> 42:39.336
Now, what the hell happened?!

42:39.338 --> 42:41.438
I won't ask you again.

42:44.911 --> 42:46.476
[Door creaks]

42:48.948 --> 42:50.647
[Television chatter]

43:13.872 --> 43:15.672
[Television chatter continues]

43:21.112 --> 43:22.512
[Sighs]

43:29.287 --> 43:31.688
[Breathing deeply]

43:34.827 --> 43:37.093
Just do it already.

43:44.202 --> 43:46.102
[Breathes deeply]

44:18.335 --> 44:22.938
I tracked your phone. I
do it with all the boys.

44:24.475 --> 44:28.710
I thought it might be
better for everybody if I left.

44:28.712 --> 44:32.647
Your uncles play rough,
baby. They always have.

44:34.985 --> 44:37.319
Where are you headed?

44:41.158 --> 44:45.160
My mom used to know a
guy who lived in Stockton.

44:45.162 --> 44:47.496
She talked about him sometimes.

44:47.498 --> 44:52.034
You know that my mom
was a junkie, too, right?

44:52.036 --> 44:54.669
Sometimes she was great.

44:54.671 --> 45:00.174
She told me my father was
a piece of sea glass.

45:00.176 --> 45:03.144
Mine was a tree.

45:03.146 --> 45:08.649
So you think this guy in Stockton
might be your dad?

45:10.119 --> 45:11.713
I don't know.

45:15.358 --> 45:17.624
Do you know who my dad is?

45:22.165 --> 45:25.666
Your mom always had a
lot of guys around, J.

45:28.704 --> 45:32.940
I just know she only loved one of them.

45:32.942 --> 45:36.742
I tried to make him feel
like a part of the family.

45:36.744 --> 45:39.579
I could take him in, I
could make him my son,

45:39.581 --> 45:42.682
but I could not make him her brother.

45:47.755 --> 45:49.155
Baz.

45:58.933 --> 46:00.600
[Door opens]

46:00.602 --> 46:02.569
<i>Man: ...between the
crew chief and the driver</i>

46:02.571 --> 46:04.036
<i>and, of course, the spotter,</i>

46:04.038 --> 46:06.306
<i>especially in a wide-open
facility like this one.</i>

46:06.308 --> 46:08.174
<i>You talk about how slick it's gonna be.</i>

46:08.176 --> 46:11.110
[Television chatter]

46:11.112 --> 46:12.644
[Door closes]

46:17.351 --> 46:19.651
No more running away, okay?

46:39.440 --> 46:40.672
Mom?

47:02.029 --> 47:05.396
Hey, it's late. You should sleep.

47:05.398 --> 47:07.632
Yeah, I'm really not that tired.

47:09.670 --> 47:11.235
Yeah, it's this house.

47:11.237 --> 47:12.971
As soon as we moved out,

47:12.973 --> 47:15.439
Lena started sleeping through the night.

47:18.145 --> 47:21.111
Listen, don't worry about Deran, man.

47:21.113 --> 47:24.048
That dude talks big,
but that's all it is.

47:24.050 --> 47:26.150
It's just talk.

47:28.221 --> 47:32.523
All right. I'll see you. Get some sleep.

47:32.525 --> 47:35.593
I shot her up the day she died.

47:37.930 --> 47:40.698
She couldn't find a vein.

47:40.700 --> 47:43.367
That sometimes happened.

47:43.369 --> 47:47.505
She asked me to do it, so I did.

47:47.507 --> 47:49.674
Right in her foot.

47:52.778 --> 47:56.113
Well, it's not your fault, man.

47:56.115 --> 47:59.216
Your mom was a wreck.

47:59.218 --> 48:01.384
She did that shit to all of us.

48:03.555 --> 48:05.789
Hey.

48:05.791 --> 48:08.692
That's not on you.

48:23.776 --> 48:25.275
Sleep.

48:58.643 --> 49:00.476
