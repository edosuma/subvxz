00:16.459 --> 00:17.894
As the Clone War

00:17.928 --> 00:20.829
scorches its destructive path
across the galaxy,

00:20.864 --> 00:24.233
it is the Jedi
who bring order to the chaos.

00:24.268 --> 00:27.904
Though as the war progresses, the
number of Jedi have declined,

00:27.938 --> 00:30.572
and new younglings are harder to find.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.809
When a youngling is located, they
are brought to the Jedi Temple

00:33.843 --> 00:38.347
and learn quickly that their true
family is now the Jedi Order.

00:38.382 --> 00:40.383
The trials are hard.

00:40.417 --> 00:41.717
Tests must be passed.

00:41.751 --> 00:44.820
But none is as important
as The Gathering.

00:44.854 --> 00:49.392
It is then that a Jedi's path
will truly begin.

00:52.262 --> 00:54.430
Hurry, younglings.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.335
You have proved to be
the top of your class.

00:59.369 --> 01:02.538
And so now is the time
of The Gathering.

01:02.572 --> 01:06.842
For a Jedi, there is no greater
challenge or honor.

01:09.413 --> 01:12.548
What is The Gathering, Padawan Tano?

01:12.582 --> 01:22.591
Petro, Ganodi, Byph,
Katooni, Zatt, and Gungi,

01:22.625 --> 01:26.695
the time has come for you
to build your own lightsabers.

01:26.729 --> 01:28.197
I knew it.
That's so wizard.

01:28.231 --> 01:29.999
Whoa!
I knew it.

01:30.033 --> 01:35.271
Be warned: this is no simple task,
and many perils lie ahead of you.

01:35.305 --> 01:40.476
Where we are going, there is no
place more sacred to the Jedi.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.644 --> 02:17.413
Not the most hospitable place.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.882
I think that's the point.

02:38.735 --> 02:40.702
It's a dead end.

02:42.906 --> 02:47.510
Younglings, outstretch your
hands and focus the Force.

02:47.544 --> 02:51.447
Together, and only together,
can we enter.

03:28.218 --> 03:29.385
Now hurry.

03:29.419 --> 03:32.088
The sun has already risen,
and we must begin.

03:47.104 --> 03:49.938
Master Yoda.

03:49.973 --> 03:54.743
The Force made physical, a Jedi is.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.946
Comes great responsibility
with that, yes?

03:59.749 --> 04:02.951
Protect others, how does a Jedi, hmm?

04:05.021 --> 04:07.456
Build your own lightsaber, you shall.

04:07.491 --> 04:11.527
But first, harvest your crystal,
each one of you must.

04:11.561 --> 04:13.095
- See, I told you.
- Yoda, wow.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.696
- No, I told you.
- No, I told you.

04:15.898 --> 04:19.235
The heart of the lightsaber,
the crystal is.

04:19.269 --> 04:23.939
Focuses the Force
from the Jedi, it does.

04:53.670 --> 04:59.542
If Jedi you are to become, enter
the crystal cave, you must.

04:59.576 --> 05:06.415
Trust yourself, trust each
other, and succeed, you will.

05:07.517 --> 05:11.787
Once you have found your
crystal, do not remain inside.

05:11.821 --> 05:18.026
As daylight ends, the door will freeze
over again, and you will be trapped.

05:18.061 --> 05:19.495
For how long?

05:19.529 --> 05:20.962
For one rotation.

05:20.997 --> 05:24.266
There will be nothing
anyone can do for you.

05:24.301 --> 05:26.702
How will we know
which crystal to pick?

05:26.736 --> 05:29.738
Only you can know which one is yours.

05:29.772 --> 05:30.806
Now, hurry.

05:46.523 --> 05:49.358
How do they expect us
to find our crystals

05:49.392 --> 05:51.993
when the whole place
is made up of ice?

05:52.028 --> 05:54.196
I don't see the big deal, though.

05:54.231 --> 05:56.298
I could easily last a night in here.

05:56.366 --> 06:00.369
From my calculations, taking into
account the planetary movements

06:00.403 --> 06:06.475
in this system, um... the sun
only rises on Ilum every 19 days.

06:06.509 --> 06:09.177
That's a very long night.

06:09.212 --> 06:12.348
Well, I don't know about you
lot, but enough with the chatter.

06:12.382 --> 06:15.150
I'm gonna be the first to get
my crystal and get out of here.

06:15.184 --> 06:16.918
Petro, wait.

06:16.953 --> 06:19.221
Maybe we should stay together.

06:19.256 --> 06:20.623
No, thank you.

06:20.657 --> 06:21.990
You're on your own.

06:23.293 --> 06:24.293
Come on.

06:24.327 --> 06:25.728
We need to keep moving.

06:29.165 --> 06:32.268
You're right.
He is selfish.

06:46.186 --> 06:48.921
Ugh!
Which way now?

06:48.955 --> 06:52.758
We don't have much time, and we
have no idea where the crystals are.

06:52.793 --> 06:54.994
We need to break into groups.

06:55.028 --> 06:56.262
What?
No.

06:57.864 --> 06:59.731
Are we Jedi or cowards?

06:59.766 --> 07:02.835
On the count of three, close
your eyes and point to a door,

07:02.869 --> 07:04.904
and that's the direction
each of us will go.

07:05.972 --> 07:09.809
One, two, three.

07:16.883 --> 07:18.750
Uh, sorry, Byph.

07:18.785 --> 07:20.286
Looks like you're on your own.

07:22.555 --> 07:25.891
Byph, your instincts
told you to go that way.

07:25.926 --> 07:28.861
You have to follow your instincts.

07:31.464 --> 07:34.066
You shouldn't be
afraid of monsters, Byph.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.168
You're a Jedi.

08:01.127 --> 08:03.495
That must be a crystal.

08:26.786 --> 08:28.888
I don't think this is the right way.

08:29.956 --> 08:32.791
We'd better go back.

08:32.825 --> 08:33.825
Wait.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.494
Up there!
Look!

08:35.528 --> 08:39.063
Something's flashing.

08:39.131 --> 08:41.066
I can't see anything.

08:41.134 --> 08:43.235
Why can't you see it?

08:43.270 --> 08:45.470
Maybe because it's your crystal.

08:45.505 --> 08:48.307
They said only we would know.

08:48.341 --> 08:49.942
You'll have to climb.

08:49.976 --> 08:51.210
But up there?

08:51.244 --> 08:54.446
It's... it's just so high.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.815
I can't do that.

08:56.849 --> 08:59.584
I believe in you.

08:59.619 --> 09:02.454
What if I get up there
and there's nothing?

09:02.488 --> 09:05.991
Well, that's a risk
you'll have to take.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.526
Hey, you're lucky.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.130
I haven't even seen anything
resembling my crystal yet.

09:11.164 --> 09:12.864
Good luck.

09:21.241 --> 09:22.707
A whistling?

09:22.742 --> 09:24.343
I can't hear anything.

09:35.588 --> 09:37.722
You think it's your crystal?

09:42.929 --> 09:44.296
Gungi, no.

09:44.331 --> 09:45.831
You'll never make it.

09:45.865 --> 09:48.233
You'll freeze to death if you fall in.

09:48.268 --> 09:50.369
You need to be patient.

09:50.403 --> 09:53.472
See how the sun is setting
and moving away from the lake?

09:53.506 --> 09:56.942
Just like the door we came
through, it's freezing over again.

09:56.977 --> 10:00.245
Once the water freezes over,
you will have very little time

10:00.280 --> 10:02.214
to get your crystal and get out.

10:04.650 --> 10:05.985
Now excuse me.

10:06.019 --> 10:07.453
I have a crystal to find.

10:07.487 --> 10:09.388
And I'm running out of time.

10:09.422 --> 10:12.024
Good luck, Gungi.

10:49.896 --> 10:52.164
This whole thing is ridiculous.

10:52.198 --> 10:54.666
I don't even think
there are any crystals.

10:54.700 --> 10:55.934
You hear me?

10:55.968 --> 10:59.571
You just have us walking in
circles until we freeze to death!

10:59.605 --> 11:02.041
I'm never gonna find a crystal, never!

11:03.343 --> 11:05.544
Whoa!

11:14.820 --> 11:16.922
Now what?

11:20.793 --> 11:23.762
Looks like I'm the first back
with my crystal.

11:23.796 --> 11:25.330
That wasn't so hard.

11:25.365 --> 11:26.965
And the others?

11:26.999 --> 11:28.400
Who knows?

11:28.435 --> 11:31.136
I didn't want to gloat,
since I found mine so quickly.

11:33.206 --> 11:35.507
Show us.

11:43.183 --> 11:45.551
A crystal you have found.

11:45.585 --> 11:47.219
Water you have brought.

11:47.253 --> 11:49.254
But that's impossible.

11:49.289 --> 11:51.690
It was my crystal.
I was sure of it.

11:51.724 --> 11:53.092
Mm.

11:53.126 --> 11:55.227
So certain were you.

11:55.261 --> 11:58.163
Go back, and closer you must look.

11:58.198 --> 12:01.133
But the door is already half closed.

12:01.167 --> 12:03.435
Then you better hurry.

12:23.389 --> 12:25.690
Oh!

12:28.361 --> 12:30.596
You can do this, Katooni.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.264
You can do it.

12:35.335 --> 12:36.635
That's impossible.

12:36.669 --> 12:41.039
It's saying there's crystals
everywhere, but I can't see anything.

12:41.073 --> 12:42.207
Where?

12:42.242 --> 12:43.742
Which way?

12:43.776 --> 12:44.743
Ah!

12:44.810 --> 12:46.512
You're useless!

12:46.546 --> 12:48.514
Stupid, useless, dumb thing.

12:48.548 --> 12:51.049
You can't even find
a simple small crystal.

13:20.813 --> 13:22.614
There's so many.

13:22.649 --> 13:26.751
How am I supposed to know
which one is mine?

13:26.786 --> 13:31.290
It's hopeless, hopeless.

14:19.994 --> 14:23.130
Well, that's going to take too long.

15:03.338 --> 15:06.540
I... I'm not afraid.

15:06.575 --> 15:08.809
I can do this.

15:08.876 --> 15:11.112
I'm a Jedi.

15:11.146 --> 15:15.082
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force will guide me.

15:40.509 --> 15:42.243
I'm running out of time.

15:42.277 --> 15:44.145
Where is it?

15:46.281 --> 15:48.415
Come on, Zatt.

15:48.450 --> 15:53.354
You're gonna have to trust yourself
instead of relying on technology.

15:53.388 --> 15:55.088
You can do it.

16:00.895 --> 16:02.696
I can feel it.

16:02.730 --> 16:04.331
It's close.

16:04.366 --> 16:06.300
I can sense it.

16:06.334 --> 16:08.068
I can sense it.

16:13.908 --> 16:15.376
That must be it.

17:48.737 --> 17:49.703
Ah!

17:51.172 --> 17:52.606
Oh, great.

18:05.687 --> 18:07.087
Oh, no.

18:07.155 --> 18:08.855
It's a dead end.

18:10.725 --> 18:12.259
Is anyone there?

18:12.294 --> 18:13.727
Can you hear me?

18:13.762 --> 18:14.861
Great.

18:14.896 --> 18:18.165
I have my crystal, but I'll
never get out of this place.

18:25.006 --> 18:26.407
Well done, Gungi.

18:26.441 --> 18:28.542
But two still remain.

18:36.751 --> 18:39.653
Ugh!
I'm running in circles.

18:39.688 --> 18:42.556
Petro!
Petro!

18:44.426 --> 18:45.392
Katooni?

18:45.427 --> 18:47.260
Petro!
I'm trapped.

18:47.295 --> 18:49.196
Can you help me get out?

18:49.230 --> 18:51.565
I...
I can't.

18:51.599 --> 18:53.667
I still haven't found my crystal.

18:53.702 --> 18:55.769
Petro, you can't leave me.

18:55.804 --> 18:58.439
I... I have to go.

18:58.473 --> 19:00.207
Petro, no!

19:01.643 --> 19:04.277
Petro!
Petro!

19:07.549 --> 19:09.450
Will they make it, Master?

19:09.484 --> 19:11.885
We should help them.

19:11.919 --> 19:13.987
Left the cave, you have.

19:14.021 --> 19:16.824
Help them, you will not.

19:19.694 --> 19:20.694
Come on!

19:39.781 --> 19:40.848
Katooni.

19:40.882 --> 19:41.882
Katooni!

19:41.916 --> 19:42.983
Petro?

19:43.017 --> 19:44.017
Petro!

19:44.051 --> 19:45.118
There's no time.

19:45.152 --> 19:46.487
Put your hand on the ice.

19:46.521 --> 19:48.021
Together, we can break it.

20:04.739 --> 20:06.673
I knew you'd come back.

20:06.708 --> 20:09.610
Come on!
The doors are closing.

20:09.644 --> 20:11.244
Petro?

20:11.279 --> 20:12.813
Go ahead.

20:12.847 --> 20:15.582
I think I see something.

20:15.617 --> 20:16.750
But it's too late.

20:16.785 --> 20:17.785
Trust me.

20:17.819 --> 20:18.786
Go.

20:36.871 --> 20:39.706
I have my crystal,
but Petro is still inside.

20:39.741 --> 20:43.209
Give up on your friend, do not.

20:57.258 --> 20:58.358
Petro!

20:58.392 --> 20:59.560
You made it.

20:59.594 --> 21:01.562
How did he break the ice?

21:01.596 --> 21:04.130
Only water made solid was the door.

21:04.165 --> 21:06.700
Easy to break if you have the will.

21:07.902 --> 21:11.271
You-you said we would be trapped.

21:11.305 --> 21:15.776
Not by the cave you
were but by your mind.

21:15.810 --> 21:17.243
Lessons, you have learned.

21:17.278 --> 21:20.881
Find courage, you did... -

21:20.915 --> 21:26.419
Hope, patience...

21:26.454 --> 21:32.860
Trust, confidence, and selflessness.

21:32.894 --> 21:34.528
Yes?

21:36.764 --> 21:42.202
Take your crystals back to the temple
and keep them safe, young Jedi.

21:42.269 --> 21:45.438
- Yes!
- So exciting.

21:45.473 --> 21:48.375
- Yay!
- All right!
