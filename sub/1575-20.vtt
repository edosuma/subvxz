Let's put on some Sade
and make a pillow fort.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.166
I'm in.

10:30.250 --> 10:34.542
This is the first day of
the rest of my super-chill life.

10:37.041 --> 10:40.291
And this is the last day
of my super-chill life.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.667
Ah, so many memories.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.750
Why, there was that one time

10:45.834 --> 10:49.667
when my dad installed
an alarm system at the house.

10:53.917 --> 10:57.291
STAAN, confirm
the house is safe.

10:59.709 --> 11:02.709
- All clear.
- Oh.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.083
What the hell was that?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.583
What are you doing, girl?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.333
You gonna sit down?

11:09.417 --> 11:11.542
No? Just crouching?

11:11.625 --> 11:13.208
Oh, my God!

11:13.291 --> 11:15.750
What is coming out
of the back of this dog?

11:15.834 --> 11:17.375
Gross!

11:17.458 --> 11:20.458
There's a man walking his dog
on our lawn.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.458
What if he's using the dog
to case our house?

11:23.542 --> 11:27.792
I read the Moroccan army
uses monkeys to test land mines.

11:27.875 --> 11:31.709
STAAN, protect us against
small animals and Moroccans.

11:31.792 --> 11:32.792
Affirmative.

Come out, come out.

11:42.709 --> 11:44.500

12:08.959 --> 12:11.917

12:12.000 --> 12:14.125

a defensive driving class

12:14.208 --> 12:15.875
in 1994.

12:15.959 --> 12:19.000
That's right before
the Oklahoma City bombing.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.959

a coincidence.

12:35.834 --> 12:36.750
Yes.
