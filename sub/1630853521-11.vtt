00:01.566 --> 00:02.524
<i>Previously on</i> All Rise...

00:02.524 --> 00:04.352
How did it go
with your parents?

00:04.352 --> 00:06.484
I didn't get to s-- Well,
I wasn't allowed to see them.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.746
Collier. You look great.

00:07.746 --> 00:09.270
Why haven't you told them

00:09.270 --> 00:10.749
that the divorce papers
were signed?

00:10.749 --> 00:12.490
I wanted to make
sure you were okay first.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.144
Our boy Brandon's in trouble.
He's being set up.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
- You gotta make this go away.
- Your Honor,

00:15.624 --> 00:17.104
I need to get you
to your chambers.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.235
- Why? What's happening?
- No time.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.454
Seriously?

00:20.846 --> 00:22.587
Ugh.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.459
I said drop the gun.
Now!

00:26.200 --> 00:27.984
I will be there
every stop of the way, okay?

00:27.984 --> 00:29.855
- I love you, Em.
- I love you, too.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.466
I told him
he had to wait in here,

00:31.466 --> 00:32.989
but he insisted
on finding you. And--

00:32.989 --> 00:34.860
- No, no, no, no.
- I lost him in the crowd.

00:34.860 --> 00:35.992
Help!

00:35.992 --> 00:37.080
I've got you, Lola.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.433
Oh my god, Ness.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.565
Can you hear me?

00:43.565 --> 00:44.609
Just stay with me. Okay?

00:48.309 --> 00:50.963

01:37.793 --> 01:39.664
I have a joke for you.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.318
A defense attorney
tells her client,

01:41.318 --> 01:44.800
"I've got good news,
and bad news."

01:44.800 --> 01:46.715
The client says,
"What's the bad news?"

01:46.715 --> 01:49.587
The lawyer says, "The bad news
is they found your blood

01:49.587 --> 01:51.111
and fingerprints
all over the crime scene."

01:51.894 --> 01:52.982
"What's the good news?"

01:54.418 --> 01:55.637
"Your cholesterol is 140."

02:00.816 --> 02:02.296
You're a tough crowd,
Miss Johnson.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.866
Hurry up and get outta here
so we can hang out more, okay?

02:10.260 --> 02:13.002
Ness's parents went back
to the hotel to get some rest.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.482
They should
be back in a few hours.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.746
If she comes out of this--

02:17.746 --> 02:22.577
When she gets out of this,
I hope she's still fearless.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.190
Yeah, and hangs
onto that idealism.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.107
All right, I gotta get to work.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.430
Geez, they're going
crazy out there

02:49.430 --> 02:51.736
over your Native American
Land Use case.

02:51.736 --> 02:54.522
Conservative pundits
are on this thing 24/7,

02:54.522 --> 02:57.873
so Bravo put a senior DDA
on a simple vandalism case.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.962
Simple, yes,
but how do you feel about

02:59.962 --> 03:01.355
gettin' back in that court room?

03:01.355 --> 03:03.008
Well, work helps me
take my mind off

03:03.008 --> 03:05.707
of the Teddy and Ness of it all.

03:05.707 --> 03:09.406
I just came from her
and she's the same.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.016
Please, any good news?

03:11.016 --> 03:12.583
Uh, well, I got another crack

03:12.583 --> 03:15.195
at beating Luke
in 802 today, so.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.066
Um, Mark.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.070
Are you kidding me?

03:21.070 --> 03:22.941
- Oh, gross.
- What? Have you not fallen

03:22.941 --> 03:25.074
victim to the HOJ's
pigeon problem, yet?

03:25.074 --> 03:29.034
Oh. Pro-tip, my friend.
Carry an umbrella. Mm-hmm.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.472
Would you mind helping
me pack up Teddy's desk?

03:31.472 --> 03:34.823
Sure. I miss his endless
explanations already.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.522
After two weeks,
it's the first day back

03:38.522 --> 03:40.568
for many of us.

03:40.568 --> 03:44.136
Nothing I say or do
will erase the violence

03:44.136 --> 03:47.183
that we experienced, but we're
doing everything that we can

03:47.183 --> 03:50.665
to ensure that something
like this never happens again.

03:50.665 --> 03:53.885
Extra security,
and extended trauma counseling.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.714
I am petitioning
to keep both of those in place.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.935
We are a family. We have
to take care of each other.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.806
And, if you
have any suggestions,

04:01.806 --> 04:03.373
don't hesitate to speak out.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.246
Um, I have one.
Can we all get raises?

04:09.031 --> 04:11.381
I really wish
I could make that happen.

04:11.381 --> 04:15.037
Look, if we can find humor in
all of this, then we can heal.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.169
It will just take some time.

04:17.169 --> 04:20.216
The only silver lining
is that we now have

04:20.216 --> 04:22.784
a deeper understanding
of the suffering that comes

04:22.784 --> 04:25.352
with being
the victims of violent crime.

04:25.352 --> 04:29.486
And it is my hope
that we will use this

04:29.486 --> 04:31.706
to become more caring

04:31.706 --> 04:34.926
and dedicated
to our very important work.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.895
I'm not gonna
lie to you Miss Carmona,

04:46.895 --> 04:48.679
this is a tough case.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.160
Prosecution will say
that this is a felony vandalism.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.031
Cut and dry.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.382
They've got dozens of eye
witnesses and video footage

04:55.382 --> 04:57.645
of you bulldozing
through a university building.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.299
It doesn't matter
what anyone saw.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.126
This isn't about that.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.998
Well, the only things
that we can lean on are

05:02.998 --> 05:05.043
the extraordinary
circumstances under which

05:05.043 --> 05:06.828
you committed the act,
but I can't guarantee

05:06.828 --> 05:08.656
that the judge will admit
that background

05:08.656 --> 05:10.135
on a vandalism case.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.267
Look, they're here.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.882
Creator, in the name
of our ancestors,

05:17.882 --> 05:21.364
please give Mr. Luke Watkins
the strength and wisdom he needs

05:21.364 --> 05:25.020
to fight for justice for me
and the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.762
Please give him words
that will help the jurors look

05:27.762 --> 05:29.677
into their hearts
to find understanding.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.201
And please, heal his wounds.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.430
All rise!

05:47.216 --> 05:49.392
You may be seated.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.308
On the record,
People v. Moir Carmona.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.005
- It means "moon."
- Miss Carmona,

05:54.005 --> 05:55.529
please don't speak out in court.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.269
Mr. Watkins, your motion?

05:57.269 --> 05:59.097
Your Honor,
Miss Carmona allegedly borrowed

05:59.097 --> 06:00.882
construction equipment
that ended up

06:00.882 --> 06:02.710
through the wall
of an unoccupied build site.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.407
Thank God it was unoccupied.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.453
I am moving
to admit the historical context

06:06.453 --> 06:08.933
on which my client, a member
of the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe,

06:08.933 --> 06:11.632
was acting. Otherwise,
she won't receive a fair trial.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.851
The defendant plowed
through the university's

06:13.851 --> 06:16.506
nearly complete science center
causing extensive damage.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.813
- It is that simple.
- It is not that simple.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.076
The building
is on sacred Tongva land.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.773
Land that my client
has been fighting tooth

06:22.773 --> 06:25.559
and nail to protect
since its planning stages.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.256
Your Honor,
any probative value

06:27.256 --> 06:29.563
of admitting the sites
history is outweighed

06:29.563 --> 06:31.347
by the prejudice
it would cause in the jury.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.044
It is immaterial to the case.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.351
Allowing it is essentially
setting up a trial

06:35.351 --> 06:37.701
within a trial over
what is a land rights issue.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.964
This is a claim of right issue,
Your Honor.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.966
Oh, come on. It's not like the
defendant's laptop was stolen.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.620
and she stole it back.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.492
This is not a theft
related case, Your Honor.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.058
Mr. Watkins?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.799
It's worse.
The defendant's people

06:48.799 --> 06:50.975
have worshipped
there for thousands of years.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.151
A sacred site was stolen.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.066
And, if someone walked
into your backyard

06:55.066 --> 06:58.026
and build a shed, you have
the right to knock it down.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.680
You can't vandalize
something on your own property.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.561
Teddy.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.564
Hey, Mr. Callan.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.174
I'm sorry Your Honor,
but the screws

07:16.174 --> 07:17.872
in my ribs set off security.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.482
But, I sorted it all out,
don't you worry.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.266
Are you sure you should be here?

07:21.876 --> 07:23.181
Yeah. I'm okay.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.358
Very well, then.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.926
Why don't we let you
get settled before we resume.

07:28.926 --> 07:32.887
And, I am very happy to see
you're okay Mister Biswas.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.063
- Thank you.
- What are you doin' here?

07:35.063 --> 07:37.369
You made me second chair
on this case three weeks ago.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.849
Other than
the hardware in my ribs

07:38.849 --> 07:40.503
and some antibiotics,
I'm doing great.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.939
Your mom told me you quit.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.637
She said the job
was too dangerous.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.639
My mom no longer has final say
over my life.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.250
That includes forbidding
tattoos and piercings.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.557
Okay, let's resume.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.821
I have given both council's
arguments consideration.

07:53.821 --> 07:58.565
Since the Gabrielino-Tongva
Tribe has long claimed rights

07:58.565 --> 08:01.568
to the land on which
San Vicente University sits,

08:01.568 --> 08:03.831
the court will allow
the jury to hear

08:03.831 --> 08:06.050
the property's history
and let them determine

08:06.050 --> 08:08.183
its relevance
to the alleged offense.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.924
The defense motion is granted.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.275
I'm paying 60 grand
a frickin' year

08:13.275 --> 08:16.147
at San Vicente University
just to have my research,

08:16.147 --> 08:18.236
which will save humanity, derailed.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.238
'Kay, which Indian's
gonna pay me back--

08:20.238 --> 08:21.370
Hey!

08:24.504 --> 08:27.507
Which Indian is gonna
pay me back for that, huh? Huh?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.470
I'll never get
into med-school now. You pricks.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.211
Order. Order.

08:37.952 --> 08:41.346
Outbursts like that will not
be tolerated in this courtroom.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.784
Court is in recess.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.759
Oh hey! Carmichael.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.979
I've been
in the minority on two cases

09:04.979 --> 09:06.589
that the court repealed
this month, so it's nice

09:06.589 --> 09:08.330
to be out for a little
mocha Monday.

09:08.330 --> 09:13.553
Well, the nice won't
last too long. Take that.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.990
Everything all right,
Carmichael?

09:15.990 --> 09:19.820
I've-- I've been a little
on edge about a lot of things,

09:19.820 --> 09:21.909
but mostly
I'm just concerned about

09:21.909 --> 09:24.476
everyone else working
at this courthouse.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.695
How is Ness?

09:28.132 --> 09:31.092
Wise words this morning,
Judge Carmichael.

09:31.092 --> 09:34.748
And I am with the extra
security and trauma counseling.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.577
Our people need
to process their feelings.

09:41.189 --> 09:44.366
So--
How was that Native American

09:44.366 --> 09:46.760
land case I've been
reading so much about?

09:46.760 --> 09:48.631
Complicated.
When it came to seizing

09:48.631 --> 09:50.415
the Native American's land,
there was no due process

09:50.415 --> 09:52.374
and the defense
is arguing that it's key

09:52.374 --> 09:54.158
to determining
if this was vandalism.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.552
Well, the constitution
does forbid depriving

09:56.552 --> 09:58.423
any person of life,
liberty, or property

09:58.423 --> 09:59.947
without due process of law.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.036
So, one could argue allowing

10:02.036 --> 10:03.646
history is necessary
in this case.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.648
Judge Carmichael,
the Native Americans

10:05.648 --> 10:07.824
had no concept
of land ownership.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.957
So, if someone doesn't know
their rights,

10:09.957 --> 10:12.046
it's okay to violate them?

10:12.046 --> 10:14.309
Your trial could spur
on protests against

10:14.309 --> 10:17.225
one hundred years
of settled LA property law.

10:17.225 --> 10:20.576
My only job is to give
this defendant a fair trial.

10:20.576 --> 10:23.231
Then, you should
welcome the tribe

10:23.231 --> 10:26.451
when they come for your house
in Baldwin Hills.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.588
Now, how does
he know where I live?

10:39.116 --> 10:40.770
- Emily.
- Hi.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.772
Hi. We never had
the chance to talk.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.383
How are you holding
up after... everything?

10:45.383 --> 10:48.604
I'm good. I wasn't the one
who was injured, you know?

10:48.604 --> 10:50.737
It was Luke.
He's the recovery champ.

10:50.737 --> 10:54.610
He is. But, our whole
department could use help.

10:54.610 --> 10:58.396
How do you feel about doing some
work for the PD's office again?

10:58.396 --> 11:01.530
- Wow, Carol, uh--
- Walk with me.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.314
I've got a hundred dollar bet
with Jerome

11:03.314 --> 11:05.577
from security to get
in 10,000 steps a day

11:05.577 --> 11:08.232
and I've only got 423.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.278
Okay. Great.

11:11.627 --> 11:15.022
Just a few more steps to go.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.328
So, do we have a deal?

11:19.026 --> 11:22.812
Look, if it is just temporary
and part-time, then okay, okay.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.901
You know,
free council initiative

11:24.901 --> 11:26.686
doesn't have room
for me yet, anyway.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.296
Also, I lost the office

11:28.296 --> 11:30.037
that I was using
at Autobahn and Quinn's

11:30.037 --> 11:32.169
to a lawyer who makes
$800 an hour.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.824
$800 an hour? Damn!

11:34.824 --> 11:36.739
Emily, I'm gonna
find a way for you

11:36.739 --> 11:39.002
to bring holistic law
to the PD's office.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.917
Well, you know Carol,
it's gonna take money.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.789
It's gonna take real money.

11:42.789 --> 11:46.706
Okay, can you get funding
from the board of supervisors?

11:47.271 --> 11:48.316
If you help me.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.276
Give me a desk away from Andy
and away from a vent,

11:52.276 --> 11:54.583
'cause I'm not gonna freeze my
ass off in that office anymore.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.933
And, and you got a deal.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.979
Ah, I'm overjoyed.

11:58.979 --> 12:02.025
And breathless.
You'll be working with Watkins.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.592
That a problem?

12:03.592 --> 12:06.290
- Mm-mm.
- Hey, Watkins. Join us.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.118
Come on. Step lively.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.033
Emily, your first assignment
will be as co-council

12:10.033 --> 12:12.035
on Luke's Native American case.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.472
Wait. What? Emily's back?

12:14.472 --> 12:16.648
Uh, for a little while. Um--

12:18.259 --> 12:20.435
You sure it's a good idea
the two of us to be--

12:20.435 --> 12:22.002
Carol, can I speak to you
for a sec?

12:27.050 --> 12:29.661
I just won a murder trial,
I don't need co-council.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.533
You'll check your egos
at the door.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.709
This case is unique,
the media's all over it

12:33.709 --> 12:35.842
and the PD's office cannot
look outgunned

12:35.842 --> 12:37.713
against Callan
and the boy wonder.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.367
All right. Well,
this is just for appearances.

12:39.367 --> 12:43.850
Yes. So, smile.
Emily, meet your co-council.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.383
Almost 1,000.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.602
Jerome, you are not
going to out-step me.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.952
All right, everybody
get to work.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.222
This is our worst
meeting place, yet.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.270
I know how much
you care about Ness.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.707
Is Robin coming?

13:17.318 --> 13:21.801
No. Speaking of Robin, there
is something I need to tell you.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.325
I'm listening.

13:24.325 --> 13:27.850
That day, we were all
just so happy to be alive,

13:27.850 --> 13:29.547
I know I was,

13:29.547 --> 13:33.029
and something
unexpected happened.

13:33.029 --> 13:37.294
I kinda kissed Andre.

13:37.294 --> 13:41.298
The whole nightmare was over
and I was feeling emotional,

13:41.298 --> 13:42.865
it was crazy.

13:42.865 --> 13:43.953
Whoa.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.088
- Does Robin--
- No! No.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.048
And it is just eating me up.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.615
Yeah, Lola, it's been two weeks.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.530
I know.

13:55.530 --> 13:59.839
And I don't know if
I'm just feeling guilty or what,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.798
but there's this weird
vibe between Robin and I.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.107
Look, I'm gonna
tell him, tonight.

14:07.107 --> 14:10.414
I just, I don't
even know where to start.

14:12.547 --> 14:13.678
Do what you'd tell me.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.246
Start with the truth.

14:19.597 --> 14:20.772
That's him.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.136
Are you family?
I'm Dr. Rios.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.922
I am.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.532
- Would you mind stepping out?
- Yeah.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.493
So, we're running tests
to see if Miss Johnson

14:45.493 --> 14:47.147
still has internal bleeding.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.583
We need to be prepared
for the worst.

14:52.369 --> 14:55.111
- Look at me, Dr. Rios.
- Yeah.

14:55.111 --> 14:58.419
This is Vanessa Johnson,
but you can call her Ness.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.421
And she just passed the bar.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.640
She is funny, she is tenacious

15:02.640 --> 15:05.034
and she is going
to make one hell of a lawyer

15:05.034 --> 15:06.906
one day
because she is a fighter.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.604
And she is fighting
right now with everything

15:09.604 --> 15:11.911
that she has, so I need
for you to do the same.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.710
And, how long
did this sitting go on for?

15:28.710 --> 15:32.235
A full month. The administration
was exceedingly patient

15:32.235 --> 15:34.194
with this unprecedented disruption.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.718
Including allowing
the protestors a steady stream

15:36.718 --> 15:39.808
of pizza
and cannabis deliveries.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.943
President Mayfield,
despite the leniency

15:43.943 --> 15:46.032
the university showed,
what happened?

15:46.032 --> 15:49.165
Our now former student
disrespected herself

15:49.165 --> 15:54.344
and this institution by causing
$250,000 worth of damage.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.780
Thank you. No further questions.

15:59.871 --> 16:04.354
Hey, um, San Vicente U has
been taken to court many times.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.052
She knows her way
around the witness stand.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.488
- You may want to--
- Pardon me

16:07.488 --> 16:09.620
for interrupting you two.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.970
Cross examination.

16:11.927 --> 16:12.972
I got this.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.671
President Mayfield,

16:16.671 --> 16:19.239
is it true you open
every university meeting

16:19.239 --> 16:21.676
and event
with a land acknowledgement

16:21.676 --> 16:24.461
thanking the Tongva
for the use of their land?

16:24.461 --> 16:26.724
Land acknowledgments
are very common these days

16:26.724 --> 16:28.726
as gestures of respect.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.120
Like calling you sir
doesn't mean I'm your butler.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.646
President Mayfield,
what do you think about

16:35.646 --> 16:37.344
reparations for slavery?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.215
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.391
Sustained. Please get
to your point, Mr. Watkins.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.046
Would you agree
that seizure of personhood

16:44.046 --> 16:47.093
and ancestral land
are both tragic and similar?

16:47.093 --> 16:49.095
I'd like to answer this one.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.706
Young man,
you can strain to make

16:51.706 --> 16:55.797
parallels with slavery, but
San Vicente's student body today

16:55.797 --> 16:59.192
is 68% students of color.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.890
The defendant's actions
deprived her classmates

17:01.890 --> 17:06.677
of an education at a high-tech
facility vital to their success.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.463
Makes you wonder if
she partook of more than pizza.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.306
Mr. Sepulveda
as an elder and a medicine man

17:26.306 --> 17:29.352
of the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe,
how did you help the university?

17:29.352 --> 17:31.789
I offered a blessing
at a ground-breaking ceremony

17:31.789 --> 17:33.704
for the new science center.

17:33.704 --> 17:36.751
I also helped design
the Golden Eagle Monument.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.579
In the time
that you were affiliated

17:38.579 --> 17:41.060
with the university, did
you ever voice any objections

17:41.060 --> 17:42.496
over the construction
on the property?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.367
No, the opposite.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.849
I prayed to my ancestors
who dwell on that sacred ground

17:47.849 --> 17:52.027
and they told me these men are
not the ones who stole our land,

17:52.027 --> 17:54.377
but scholars
who are to be welcomed.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.901
The university
has been a respectful steward.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.515
Young miss Carmona should not
have destroyed that building.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.386
No further questions.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.954
- Let me take the crossing.
- That's not the plan.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.130
I can make that jury wanna
get out their own bulldozers.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.784
You trust me?

18:09.784 --> 18:12.439
Cross-examination,
or are you two consulting

18:12.439 --> 18:14.354
the ruins over this one?

18:19.010 --> 18:21.839
Mr. Sepulveda,
you're the founder and president

18:21.839 --> 18:25.626
of the Tongva fund, which
offers blessings at universities

18:25.626 --> 18:27.106
and commercial
construction sites.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.455
Things of that nature.
Is that correct?

18:28.455 --> 18:29.847
Yes.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.067
In fact, I counted 32 developers

18:32.067 --> 18:34.330
who paid you
approximately $200,000

18:34.330 --> 18:35.766
in the last year alone.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.073
And that's to, what?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.901
Assuage the public's guilt

18:39.901 --> 18:41.468
over stealing
Native American lands

18:41.468 --> 18:43.426
and giving developers good PR.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.646
Objection, Your Honor.
Leading. What is this?

18:45.646 --> 18:47.474
Sustained.
Be careful, Miss Lopez.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.040
The US Government
has not recognized you

18:49.040 --> 18:50.955
as a tribe, why is that?

18:50.955 --> 18:53.349
Our 2,000 members can't
get along well enough to agree

18:53.349 --> 18:55.395
on a meeting date
to fight for it.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.397
Wait. Wait.

18:57.397 --> 19:00.878
So, you don't speak
for the entire Tongva tribe

19:00.878 --> 19:02.706
any more than Miss Carmona does?

19:02.706 --> 19:04.752
- Objection, Your Honor. Leading.
- I'm an elder. And I--

19:04.752 --> 19:07.276
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Thank you.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.765
This monument
really is impressive.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.332
When you said
you were taking me out,

19:19.332 --> 19:21.725
this is not what I envisioned.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.032
I got sandwiches from
your favorite sandwich shop.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.600
Vinegar chips. Extra pickles.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.429
- I pulled out all the stops.
- Yeah.

19:29.429 --> 19:34.085
Mark, I got one piece
of good news. Collier.

19:34.085 --> 19:38.046
His lupus is in remission.
Maybe for good.

19:38.046 --> 19:42.224
So, I think I'm ready
to take a very long break

19:42.224 --> 19:44.008
from being in touch with him,

19:44.008 --> 19:46.924
and I'm submitting
the divorce paperwork

19:46.924 --> 19:48.187
first thing in the morning.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.239
After all the insanity, I wanted
to give you some space, but--

19:59.502 --> 20:01.548
Let's set up
our wedding registry.

20:01.548 --> 20:04.028
Air fryer. I need to know
what the hype is about.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.422
Right?

20:09.947 --> 20:11.384
Mm.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.037
Damn.
Mm-hmm.

20:13.037 --> 20:16.432
Whoever made these noodles,
I salute you.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.609
And award you
the pad Thai medal of honor

20:19.609 --> 20:22.264
because this place is yummy.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.352
So good.

20:24.614 --> 20:29.619
So, I wanted to um,
talk about something.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.751
Me too.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.189
I know weren't supposed
to talk about

20:34.189 --> 20:36.235
the "L word" until
after I fully recovered.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.630
Right. Because, you know,
if we talk about it,

20:40.630 --> 20:41.718
then we might--

20:43.894 --> 20:45.287
we might, um--

20:49.291 --> 20:51.902
And you know,
court would be awkward tomorrow.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.339
We could talk
about it real quick

20:53.339 --> 20:54.949
and then we can go back to it.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.125
Well, that's tempting, um--

20:59.823 --> 21:02.826
Oh.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.480
Could you pass the spring rolls?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.568
Sure.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.791
Oh. This is a problem.
This is not good.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.749
We're gonna have
to seriously debate over this

21:12.749 --> 21:16.710
because, um, there's--
there's one left.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.844
I'll have it.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.629
Oh, so you're just gonna take
the whole thing?

21:22.629 --> 21:23.760
Mm-hmm.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.328
Not gonna share at all?

21:31.507 --> 21:34.118
You did not
just grab the spring roll

21:34.118 --> 21:35.555
- It's mine!
- from me like that!

21:38.775 --> 21:39.820
I will share.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.216
I thought I was gonna lose you.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.806
I hope you're hungry, 'cause--
Shh.

22:11.547 --> 22:12.722
Bailey's sleepin'.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.078
Where are you goin'?

22:21.078 --> 22:23.820
Bailey and I are gonna
head up early to my parents.

22:23.820 --> 22:27.041
You can come down after your
trial on Friday like we planned.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.738
I don't understand.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.784
Bailey is the Tasmanian Devil
on the plane.

22:33.743 --> 22:34.788
I saw you...

22:35.963 --> 22:37.051
and Andre,

22:38.357 --> 22:41.272
the day of that HOJ breech,
in your chambers.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.154
I ran up them stairs,
two stairs at a time,

22:53.154 --> 22:54.851
afraid that you might be hurt.

22:56.636 --> 22:57.680
To see that.

22:58.768 --> 23:02.424
I've been tryin'
to stand by you Lola.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.428
After everything
you've been through, I--

23:10.780 --> 23:11.912
Robin, I am...

23:12.869 --> 23:13.957
I am so--

23:15.698 --> 23:18.919
I am sorry from-- from...

23:20.573 --> 23:23.967
the depths of my being.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.360
I am sorry.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.277
I was in shock.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.628
I can't stop seeing it
in my head.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.938
So...

23:37.938 --> 23:41.594
I'm gonna
take Bailey and--

23:46.686 --> 23:49.689
Robin, can we just talk?

23:49.689 --> 23:54.389
Can we, please? Can we just
talk about this, please?

23:54.389 --> 23:55.651
- We're talking--
- Robin.

23:55.651 --> 23:56.739
I--

23:59.263 --> 24:00.526
I love you.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.224
Robin, I love you.

24:04.138 --> 24:07.750
I need some time, Lola.

24:10.231 --> 24:13.843
You know, what I do know
is that shock or no shock,

24:13.843 --> 24:17.456
you don't grab the closest
person and lock lips with them.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.504
C'mon. How long
has that been goin' on?

24:22.504 --> 24:26.334
No. No. Nothing.
Nothing is going on.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.467
Then why did
I have to bring it up to you?

24:28.467 --> 24:30.251
Before you brought it to me?

24:35.517 --> 24:36.997
You're right.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.523
You're right,
but please, just...

24:42.742 --> 24:46.310
do not leave, please.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.272
Don't punish me
by taking my child, please.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.057
I'm not taking your child.

24:54.057 --> 24:58.714
Our child is going
to see her grandparents.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.847
I'm not the bad guy here, Lola.

25:03.850 --> 25:04.894
I'll get it.

25:05.678 --> 25:06.766
I always do.

25:22.825 --> 25:26.873
Again, we highly advise
against you testifying.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.615
- We're in a good spot.
- But this is my story to tell.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.792
Your defense centers around
the history of the land.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.576
We have an expert.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.100
All those old guys
flapping their lips on TV,

25:37.100 --> 25:39.407
they're calling me
a crazy radical.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.322
But, if I could
just explain what happened

25:41.322 --> 25:42.976
to my people,
they'll understand why I did it.

25:42.976 --> 25:46.022
If you get on that stand,
you have to show remorse.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.546
They tried
to wipe us off the face

25:47.546 --> 25:49.286
of the Earth
and I should apologize?

25:49.286 --> 25:51.550
Moon, think about your future.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.943
I am fighting
to get the university

25:53.943 --> 25:55.815
to let you graduate.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.644
We can win
without your testimony,

25:58.644 --> 26:00.384
but we could lose with it.

26:01.472 --> 26:02.952
It's up to me though, right?

26:02.952 --> 26:06.956
Okay, but it will
get personal and ugly.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.133
How long have you been fighting

26:10.133 --> 26:11.700
the building project,
Miss Carmona?

26:11.700 --> 26:12.788
Since freshman year.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.923
I collected signatures, met
with university board members,

26:16.923 --> 26:18.489
the city council.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.143
No one would pay attention.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.231
Then, what did you do?

26:21.231 --> 26:23.059
I organized the sit-in.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.366
I thought if we could
just educate the public

26:25.366 --> 26:27.324
about our culture,
they'd understand.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.370
The site is sacred.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.329
Place of creation.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.722
And how did your sit-in go?

26:33.722 --> 26:35.594
Hundreds of people came out.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.379
Tribe members,
professors, students.

26:38.379 --> 26:39.989
We got national news coverage.

26:39.989 --> 26:43.253
And the university,
with their Tongva statue,

26:43.253 --> 26:45.168
how did they respond
to your protest?

26:45.168 --> 26:49.346
They hired gardeners to stink us
out by spreading fertilizer.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.087
Objection. Speculation.
Move to strike.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.785
They're allowed
to seed the lawn.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.134
Sustained and stricken.

26:55.788 --> 26:58.747
And what happened
when the protesters dispersed?

26:58.747 --> 27:00.357
I thought, "This is it.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.142
"You know,
if I don't do something now,

27:02.142 --> 27:04.361
"my ancestral land
will be disrespected forever."

27:04.361 --> 27:06.886
Miss Carmona,
are you sorry for the damage

27:06.886 --> 27:09.628
that you did to that building?

27:14.197 --> 27:15.721
You know, I grew up in LA.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.549
Ran around the mall.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.683
Snuck seconds on Costco samples
like any other kid.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.600
But, other kids didn't
have to bike down the street

27:25.600 --> 27:27.297
where their ancestors
were dragged

27:27.297 --> 27:29.473
screaming from their beds.

27:29.473 --> 27:33.869
Or go to school where children
were murdered, women raped.

27:33.869 --> 27:37.046
You know we learn in school
that in the 1700s,

27:37.046 --> 27:39.222
Father Serra
built a beautiful mission

27:39.222 --> 27:40.963
right where
the university is today.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.704
But what they didn't teach us

27:42.704 --> 27:46.099
was that it was built
by my enslaved ancestors.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.579
And Father Serra carried a whip.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.192
So, no.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.237
No, I'm not sorry.

28:01.418 --> 28:05.640
Okay. Well, that was something.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.468
Order, everyone.

28:07.468 --> 28:10.079
Request a recess now.
Request a recess now.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.254
I still have more questions.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.737
Uh, Your Honor, we'd like
to request a short recess.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.739
The people still need
to cross examine the witness.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.654
I understand
the people want to address

28:19.654 --> 28:21.438
Miss Carmona's
testimony swiftly,

28:21.438 --> 28:25.660
but the witness needs time
to collect herself.

28:25.660 --> 28:28.184
Court is in recess
for lunch until 1:30.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.886
This is great.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.452
Now the jury's gonna spend
all of lunch

28:35.452 --> 28:37.846
thinking the ancestors
sent that pigeon.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.283
You know what? Maybe they did.

28:42.459 --> 28:43.983
We're cutting a deal.
- Wait! What?

28:43.983 --> 28:45.462
The jury is sympathetic
to the defendant.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.160
How can you be sure of that?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.988
When you've been doing
this as long as I have,

28:48.988 --> 28:50.685
you know when a deck is stacking
against you.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.252
You know my people,
the other Indians,

28:52.252 --> 28:53.732
endured a century
of colonialism.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.907
I'm sympathetic, too.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.606
Misdemeanor with restitution,
we all go home.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.303
We'll talk to our client.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.740
Uh, is it too late to suggest

29:01.740 --> 29:03.350
arm wrestling
to settle this deal?

29:03.350 --> 29:05.352
Seriously, how you doing?

29:05.352 --> 29:07.746
Hangin' in there. Thanks.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.052
And Callan, I'd win.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.706
Sling and all. Yeah.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.667
- So?
- It's totally within reason.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.669
Do we take the deal?

29:18.669 --> 29:21.498
I was just explaining that
the restitution will be high,

29:21.498 --> 29:23.936
but we can get them to reduce
the amount significantly.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.764
But, then
I'd have to plead guilty.

29:27.461 --> 29:30.377
Moon, you do not want
to be cross-examined

29:30.377 --> 29:32.031
by DDA Callan, okay?

29:32.031 --> 29:34.773
Or bow-tie boy for that matter.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.210
Also, it is a good deal.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.647
And, Moon, if were convicted
of a felony,

29:39.647 --> 29:41.518
your life will take
a very bad turn.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.957
No, no. What I did was right.

29:48.699 --> 29:51.311
I could use a good smudging
right now.

29:55.054 --> 29:56.533
No deal.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.884
Okay. Well,
that was a good talk.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.192
All right pal, you're up next.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.804
Mark, I usually have to fight
you to question a key witness.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.762
I just think that you should--

30:07.762 --> 30:09.459
Because we can't have
a white guy playing hardball

30:09.459 --> 30:11.331
with a little
Native American girl?

30:11.331 --> 30:14.421
Teddy! You can call her out
on things that I can't.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.169
Miss Carmona,
your Tongva lineage

30:23.169 --> 30:24.735
is on your father's side,
is that correct?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.737
Yes, my great-grandfather
was Tongva.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.391
He lived near the Cahuenga Pass.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.002
It's the 101 freeway now.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.613
So, that would make you,
what, one eighth Tongva?

30:32.613 --> 30:36.573
Yes, but you are trying
to make me sound non-native.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.924
The missionaries
forced my people to assimilate.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.578
Would you tell the jury which
tribal roles you're listed on?

30:44.886 --> 30:47.323
Answer the question,
Miss Carmona.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.891
- None.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't hear--

30:49.891 --> 30:52.241
- I'm not on any tribal role.
- Let me get this straight,

30:52.241 --> 30:54.200
you can't produce
a single document

30:54.200 --> 30:55.854
that proves you're Tongva.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.247
Well, the US government
uses records

30:58.247 --> 31:00.771
from the Catholic mission
to determine our heritage.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.382
When they put bounties
on our heads

31:02.382 --> 31:04.558
in the 1800s,
people hid their background.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.603
I had a word
with your estranged mother.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.736
Is it true you weren't even
raised with Tongva traditions?

31:08.736 --> 31:11.304
My father died when I was six.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.480
I didn't know about
my heritage 'til high school,

31:13.480 --> 31:14.916
but then I learned everything
that I could.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.962
Did you organize
a campus-wide protest

31:16.962 --> 31:18.964
against plastic-wear
your sophomore year

31:18.964 --> 31:20.704
and a fight
for gender neutral bathrooms

31:20.704 --> 31:22.489
- as a junior?
- Yeah. So?

31:22.489 --> 31:24.360
Did you ever think
you might be a cause junkie?

31:24.360 --> 31:27.320
Objection. Argumentative. 352.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.669
Sustained and stricken.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.627
Anything else, Mr. Biswas?

31:30.627 --> 31:32.586
I think we've heard enough
from this witness.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.284
Miss Carmona, you may step down.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.422
Hey, call me whatever you want,

31:42.422 --> 31:43.858
but you're nothing
but a white man's lackey.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.340
Some of us
don't have the privilege

31:47.340 --> 31:48.776
of putting
on a brown person's identity

31:48.776 --> 31:50.734
whenever we feel
like it, Leslie.

31:50.734 --> 31:53.128
Oh sorry, it's legally Moir now.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.391
- Mr. Biswas.
- It's not cool nowadays,

31:55.391 --> 31:57.002
unless you're being prosecuted.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.568
Mr. Biswas, that's enough.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.182
Please, say nothing.

32:09.666 --> 32:12.669
Hey, Callan. I thought
you'd still be in there.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.628
It's in the jury's hands now.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.196
Oh. It's Collier.

32:18.632 --> 32:21.287
Two minutes. I'm so sorry.

32:21.678 --> 32:22.766
Okay?

32:26.466 --> 32:28.511
Okay. Did you take
your medication this morning?

32:29.860 --> 32:31.732
Okay, well try lying
down for a little bit.

32:31.732 --> 32:32.863
I--

32:35.518 --> 32:39.000
Okay, um, I will stop by
this weekend.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.088
I gotta go.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.440
Why do I feel like I'm living
in some tawdry French film?

32:51.099 --> 32:52.753
Be right with you.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.930
Well, Look at you.

32:56.757 --> 32:57.845
Mom.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.032
Oh.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.817
This is coffee these days, huh?
Oh, boy.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.951
A lot's changed since we moved
to the Linden community.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.912
Mom, I'm so touched
you're here--

33:21.912 --> 33:23.131
Mom.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.873
Why-- Mom? Mom!

33:25.873 --> 33:27.005
Why are you here?

33:27.744 --> 33:28.876
Well,

33:30.182 --> 33:31.792
I brought your father
to a big city hospital

33:31.792 --> 33:33.446
so they can help him.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.535
Wait, he's there now?

33:35.535 --> 33:38.451
What's wrong?
Why didn't you call me?

33:38.451 --> 33:41.584
Mom, I tried to visit
several times.

33:41.584 --> 33:42.890
They wouldn't let me in.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.152
Honey, the assembly, they ruled

33:44.152 --> 33:45.632
that it was a spiritual malady,

33:45.632 --> 33:49.201
and uh, we consulted
with Guru Young.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.072
Who's been dead for 35 years.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.292
Would you consult an old VHS?

33:54.075 --> 33:55.120
Yes.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.775
And the only reason
that I am here

33:58.775 --> 34:02.040
is because
your father's getting worse.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.650
So, I broke him out.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.652
Are they holding you
against your will?

34:05.652 --> 34:07.001
No, I used the wrong words.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.003
I'm sorry
I'm not as smart as you.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.614
Honey. Honey, you loved
living at the Linden Community.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.225
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.661
- No, I didn't
- Yes, you did.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.054
No, I didn't.
That's why I left.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.707
- You did.
- Mom, I haven't been there

34:17.707 --> 34:19.622
since I was a kid
because it drives me crazy.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.276
You had a ball.
You didn't wear shoes.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.887
Okay. It's all right
if you don't have Nikes

34:23.887 --> 34:26.673
and frothy drinks, but mom,
there's no medical care.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.979
Think.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.723
You know, things are just--
They're just stricter now.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.684
Has the jury reached a verdict?

34:38.815 --> 34:40.295
We have, Your Honor.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.644
Foreperson, please hand
the verdict form

34:41.644 --> 34:42.776
to the bailiff.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.346
- Your Honor.
- Thank you.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.354
As to count one,
a violation of penal code

34:55.354 --> 34:57.573
section 594, vandalism,

34:57.573 --> 35:00.489
we the jury find
the defendant not guilty.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.062
Thank you.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.630
Congratulations, Moon.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.808
I don't understand.
The law is crystal clear.

35:14.808 --> 35:16.723
Juries disregard the evidence

35:16.723 --> 35:19.378
and follow their own beliefs
more often than you'd think.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.336
Makes my insides throb.

35:21.336 --> 35:22.946
Do medicine men
make house calls?

35:24.861 --> 35:26.733
And so, I worked a little bit

35:26.733 --> 35:29.866
of my holistic law magic
on Moon's suspension.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.216
And?

35:31.216 --> 35:33.218
And, I got her the internship

35:33.218 --> 35:36.090
that she wanted at the Bureau
of Indian Affairs in DC.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.961
Amazing.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.094
So she gets to graduate
and the school is thrilled

35:40.094 --> 35:44.272
that she won't be setting foot
on campus again, so win-win.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.882
Speaking of winning,

35:45.882 --> 35:49.364
what do you think
about teaming up again?

35:49.364 --> 35:51.061
I think it's not a bad idea.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.587
Come here.

35:54.587 --> 35:55.979
Oh, so sorry.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.198
- It's okay.
- You okay?

35:57.198 --> 35:58.547
Mm-hmm.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.462
You wanna go celebrate,

36:00.462 --> 36:04.466
and talk about the--
the thing...

36:05.337 --> 36:06.381
with an L?

36:07.426 --> 36:10.211
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.647
Let's go talk about the thing.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.434
With an L.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.355
Here we are.

36:23.355 --> 36:28.142
Oh boy.
That was a steep hill.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.144
Well, the doctor said
that early stage

36:30.144 --> 36:32.668
congestive heart failure is
very treatable with medication.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.366
You'll be able
to handle it in no time.

36:34.366 --> 36:36.063
No. No more doctors.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.065
I gotta get back
to the community.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.589
As a professor,
it was theory,

36:40.589 --> 36:43.549
but now, I am creating
the ideal society.

36:43.549 --> 36:45.246
Dad! Please!

36:45.246 --> 36:48.249
I will not die in a world
of trickledown economics,

36:48.249 --> 36:50.817
and plastic thingies.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.949
- Okay.
- Your father is just hungry.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.342
Help yourself to the fridge.

36:54.342 --> 36:55.996
Thank you.
- Yeah.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.304
Where are you going?

36:59.304 --> 37:01.784
- Mom. Where are you going?
- Shh.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.265
His heart is going to boom
if he knows I'm going

37:04.265 --> 37:05.832
back to the community
without him. So, shh.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.442
No, no, no, no, no.

37:07.442 --> 37:08.965
You cannot leave me
here with him, okay?

37:08.965 --> 37:10.315
I did not sign up for this.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.665
Sherri. Sherri,
the way you left.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.362
You broke his heart.

37:14.362 --> 37:15.581
So, you can fix it.

37:17.887 --> 37:20.716
Sherri, where do you keep
the kimchi?

37:30.552 --> 37:32.250
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.469
Process your feelings.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.170
Yes.

37:40.170 --> 37:46.133
It's the HOJ attack,
but also Robin and Bailey

37:46.133 --> 37:50.180
are in Detroit and I'm going
home to an empty house.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.965
Aw. When are
you gonna join them?

37:53.619 --> 37:55.838
I don't know if I am.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.538
Oh.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.498
We're going to need
a whole bottle.

38:03.498 --> 38:08.460
Excuse me. Um,
bottle of the same. Thank you.

38:08.460 --> 38:12.202
So, they acquitted
that Native American girl.

38:12.202 --> 38:15.162
You steered that trial straight

38:15.162 --> 38:17.904
into jury nullification
like a cruise ship

38:17.904 --> 38:20.123
by allowing the history
of the university land.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.734
I did no such thing.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.257
Oh, gloves down.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.389
Uh, wine's here.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.042
Enjoy your Merlot.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.394
Pigeons got him.
Should we tell him?

38:32.266 --> 38:33.833
Nah!

38:35.661 --> 38:39.969
Do you think my personal beliefs
influenced this case?

38:39.969 --> 38:43.712
Judges can only rely
on their own sense of fairness.

38:43.712 --> 38:46.846
It's inevitable that
our humanity comes into play.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.812
- What?
- It's Ness.

38:57.900 --> 38:58.945
I'll get the check.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.076
You go.

39:00.076 --> 39:01.208
Thank you.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.216
Pads in place, Charging.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.784
Pause CPR. Clear.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.396
Okay, continue CPR.

39:17.485 --> 39:20.532
<i>♪ You sidelined me
like a tiger ♪</i>

39:20.532 --> 39:22.708
Close the curtain.
Charging again.

39:22.708 --> 39:23.839
Continue CPR.

39:25.624 --> 39:29.802

39:31.107 --> 39:32.195

39:36.852 --> 39:39.464
Dead? What do you mean dead?

39:40.508 --> 39:43.946
No, that's-- that's impossible.

39:45.426 --> 39:48.821

39:50.431 --> 39:53.913

39:57.220 --> 39:59.092
<i>♪ But you're never gonna call ♪</i>

39:59.092 --> 40:00.963
I should have taken
Collier's call more seriously.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.532
I could've
checked on him sooner.

40:04.532 --> 40:07.361
He said he was better.
I can't believe he's gone.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.887
With everything
that's happened and now this?

40:15.848 --> 40:20.330

40:22.332 --> 40:27.294

40:43.223 --> 40:47.532
That's right, Ness.
You're gonna be okay.

40:55.931 --> 40:59.369
