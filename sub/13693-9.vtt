WEBVTT

00:17.232 --> 00:19.109
He looks in a bad way.

00:22.111 --> 00:25.365
Of all
the beasts in the world,
it had to be you, Big Eric.

00:30.203 --> 00:33.874
DUNCAN: He's well
off the beaten track.
Where's he come from?

00:33.957 --> 00:37.002
-Duncan, bullets.
-Bullets?

00:37.084 --> 00:39.421
-Bullets.
-You've got them.

00:39.504 --> 00:44.300
-If I had them, would I
be asking you for them?
-Do you want me to get some?

00:44.384 --> 00:47.971
No, son, I'm going to sit here
and wait till
the beast comes to me.

00:48.055 --> 00:50.849
Then I'm going to put
him out of his misery
with a few harsh words.

00:50.932 --> 00:52.141
(DUNCAN SNIGGERING)

00:52.225 --> 00:53.477
Go!

02:09.594 --> 02:15.267
-What on earth
are you playing at?
-No, I think it's all right.

02:15.350 --> 02:21.815
Okay, back, back, back, back,
back. Back, back,
keep coming, keep coming.

02:21.898 --> 02:23.984
Whoa, stop, stop! Stop there.

02:26.569 --> 02:29.030
Have you ever
reversed in before?

02:31.992 --> 02:33.785
One very big haggis.

02:33.869 --> 02:35.996
Do you know how much
this fridge unit's costing us?

02:36.079 --> 02:38.331
And he nearly
slams it into the wall.

02:39.624 --> 02:41.960
-What are you grinning at?
-You.

02:42.043 --> 02:45.129
And how deep down
I know you're enjoying
every minute of this.

02:45.213 --> 02:48.632
Could you plug this
into the kitchen
for me, please?

02:48.716 --> 02:50.385
Be careful with the haggis.

02:50.469 --> 02:54.514
You know, I quite like you
when you're in
your organising mode.

02:58.393 --> 03:00.395
-Who's that?
-Don't know.

03:05.275 --> 03:08.570
Are you lost?
Can we help at all?

03:08.652 --> 03:12.032
I'm looking for this man.

03:12.115 --> 03:13.950
LEXIE: It's Golly, isn't it?

03:17.537 --> 03:23.126
Golly's up on the hills
somewhere. It might be
sometime before he's back.

03:23.209 --> 03:25.169
Where?

03:25.253 --> 03:29.841
-Well, they're headed
to Raglan Glen, up there.
-Thanks.

03:29.925 --> 03:34.262
-It'd be nice to know
who's asking for him.
-Paul Bowman.

03:34.346 --> 03:38.433
-And how do you know Golly?
-I don't.

03:40.435 --> 03:43.062
Archie, I need to get a number
off you for the band.

03:43.146 --> 03:45.440
-Hang on a minute.
-Morning, Archie.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.443
-Morning.
-Morning, Archie.

03:49.528 --> 03:50.946
Morning.

04:03.166 --> 04:06.044
I've been helping you organise
the Gillie's
Ball for years now.

04:06.128 --> 04:09.381
Ah, but this year
you're the host.
And with Irene gone...

04:09.463 --> 04:13.260
Well, it's just a traditional
ball, so it's gonna be
the same as it was last year

04:13.343 --> 04:16.137
and the year before that
and the year before that.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.224
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

04:19.307 --> 04:23.562
Right. Oops.
Right here would be good.

04:23.645 --> 04:26.064
And then the waitresses
can serve drinks
as the guests come in.

04:26.148 --> 04:28.442
Oh, would you like any help
in the kitchen?

04:28.525 --> 04:30.819
Things aren't
that bad just yet.

04:30.901 --> 04:34.239
Don't worry, everything's
in hand. Honestly.

04:34.322 --> 04:36.241
-Morning.
-Morning.

04:36.324 --> 04:39.745
I thought
the boarders of the old jardin
might need a haircut.

04:39.828 --> 04:41.788
That's very kind of
you to offer, Kilwillie.

04:41.872 --> 04:45.625
Oh, no. I didn't mean...
I meant you could
borrow it, that's all.

04:45.709 --> 04:48.378
Really no need.
Andrew lent me his
just the other day.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.171
-Oh.
-Trust it did the job?

04:50.254 --> 04:52.965
It certainly did and now
you're here,

04:53.049 --> 04:55.802
Kilwillie, do you
want to stay and be a
helper, too?

04:55.885 --> 04:58.095
Could you define
helper a bit more clearly?

04:58.179 --> 05:02.768
Well, to begin with, all those
chairs have got to be moved
round the tables and then...

05:02.851 --> 05:05.269
Thing is I've got...

05:05.353 --> 05:11.443
Oh, well, you know me.
Always ready to
lend a helping hand.

05:11.526 --> 05:14.905
I'm sorry, Molly, but...

05:14.988 --> 05:17.115
(WHISPERING) Who
the dickens is he?

05:17.199 --> 05:20.702
-Andrew, as I said.
-Andrew.

05:22.287 --> 05:23.455
Right!

05:31.338 --> 05:34.590
You should leave
a few of these unshelled.
It really sets the plates off.

05:34.674 --> 05:37.094
Isn't there something else
you could be getting on with?

05:37.177 --> 05:42.265
No, no, no. I've kept
the whole day clear for you.

05:42.348 --> 05:46.395
I even told Golly and Duncan
I couldn't go
stalking with them.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.896
Hmm, I wonder
what he's doing back.

05:54.361 --> 05:57.739
Give me one minute, okay?

05:57.823 --> 05:59.783
Take your time.

06:08.207 --> 06:10.794
I thought you
were up on the hill.

06:10.877 --> 06:14.588
No, boss, I'm here.

06:14.673 --> 06:18.593
-I was just wondering why.
-Saw Big Eric.

06:18.677 --> 06:21.638
Injured. Pretty bad.

06:21.721 --> 06:24.349
-Are you sure it was him?
-Yeah.

06:24.433 --> 06:28.185
I think one of the younger
stags gave him more than he
bargained for in a rut.

06:28.270 --> 06:30.772
Golly thinks we should
put him out of his misery.

06:30.856 --> 06:34.860
-So why didn't you
just take the shot?
-Um...

06:37.612 --> 06:40.407
Dunc,
what are you looking for?

06:40.490 --> 06:41.782
Ammunition.

06:48.790 --> 06:52.543
-Boys,
I've got a job for somebody.
-BOTH: Certainly.

06:52.627 --> 06:55.714
There's a box in the attic
with all
the table decorations.

06:55.797 --> 07:01.052
-BOTH: I'll go.
-Oh, on second thought,
it's really a two-man job.

07:01.136 --> 07:05.265
-What sort of box?
-Oh, I'm not sure really.
A small box I think.

07:05.347 --> 07:08.393
-But it's very heavy.
-We'll find it I'm sure,
dear Molly.

07:08.477 --> 07:11.645
-It could be
under some things.
-We'll be back in a trice.

07:11.729 --> 07:15.567
-So it's a small
box under some things?
-Yes.

07:20.697 --> 07:23.199
-Molly.
-Yes?

07:23.282 --> 07:27.788
I just wanted to be absolutely
sure... Everything in
the garden's rosy, isn't it?

07:27.871 --> 07:31.874
Well, apart from the
Rosamundi having a touch...

07:31.958 --> 07:34.795
No,
no, no, I meant between us.

07:34.878 --> 07:38.964
-After the proposal.
-Oh, of course.

07:39.049 --> 07:42.803
Because we did agree that we
wouldn't let it stop us being
chums, didn't we?

07:42.886 --> 07:48.392
As far as I'm concerned,
Kilwillie,
nothing will ever change.

07:48.475 --> 07:52.896
-Where is the attic?
-Top of the house, dear boy.
It usually is.

07:58.693 --> 08:00.862
(GRUNTING)

08:00.946 --> 08:02.781
Okay.

08:02.864 --> 08:04.408
Good.

08:04.491 --> 08:06.784
Okay, give me your
hand and I'll pull you up.

08:06.867 --> 08:11.665
I'm fine.
I have scaled Ben Nevis.
I think I can manage this.

08:11.748 --> 08:15.836
I was in the Himalayas
about five years back.
You ever climbed there?

08:15.919 --> 08:17.713
Well, not recently.

08:24.845 --> 08:27.305
Well, pull, man, pull!

08:29.808 --> 08:34.061
-So he definitely
has to be culled?
-Well, from what Duncan says.

08:34.145 --> 08:38.817
It's silly, but it feels
like losing one of the family.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.446
I better get going. The sooner
I'm gone, the sooner I'll
be back to help.

08:42.528 --> 08:45.949
She so wants this
evening to be a success,
but honestly, Archie,

08:46.032 --> 08:49.119
I could have
never coped on my own
like she's trying to do.

08:49.202 --> 08:53.248
Well, just do what you can.
She'll thank you
for it in the end.

09:02.589 --> 09:07.012
-Molly, did Archie leave
the number for the band?
-Was he supposed to?

09:08.597 --> 09:09.890
(SIGHING)

10:19.875 --> 10:25.048
Do you know, I think our
search will be more
profitable at the other end.

10:25.132 --> 10:27.926
-Perhaps we
should admit defeat.
-Nonsense!

10:28.009 --> 10:31.096
If you knew Molly half as well
as I do, you'd know that

10:31.179 --> 10:33.682
defeat is not a word in her
vocabulary.

10:35.183 --> 10:38.145
You're rather close
to Molly, aren't you?

10:38.228 --> 10:42.690
Perhaps none so close,
though I say it myself.

10:42.773 --> 10:45.402
-And she never
mentioned me to you?
-No.

10:47.154 --> 10:48.572
Good grief!

10:48.655 --> 10:52.284
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just... I'm sorry.

10:52.367 --> 10:57.497
Yes, well,
perhaps we should concentrate
on the matter in hand.

10:57.581 --> 10:59.708
Not that one.

11:05.714 --> 11:07.340
So now what?

11:09.092 --> 11:11.803
Simply have to open
it from this side.

11:23.190 --> 11:26.485
BOTH: Help! Help!

11:26.568 --> 11:29.321
Help! Help!

11:33.325 --> 11:35.786
There is a track, you know,
if you want to stay on it.

11:35.869 --> 11:39.372
Sorry, I'll bring him up
once we've got Big Eric.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.421
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

11:46.505 --> 11:48.423
(ENGINE REVVING)

11:52.093 --> 11:54.178
Do you think we're a
bit stuck?

11:54.261 --> 11:57.098
I think there's
a distinct possibility.

11:57.182 --> 11:59.101
(ENGINE REVVING)

12:05.732 --> 12:07.733
Twenty cases.
Ten red, ten white.

12:07.817 --> 12:10.237
Right. I don't actually want
it here, though.

12:11.696 --> 12:14.699
That's fine, if you
just put them... Thanks.

12:14.783 --> 12:17.536
I need this wine
lifted out to the marquee...

12:22.416 --> 12:23.959
Molly?

12:24.751 --> 12:25.919
Molly?

12:26.711 --> 12:29.631
Molly? Molly?

12:31.133 --> 12:32.509
(EXPLOSION)

12:32.592 --> 12:34.052
(GASPING)

12:36.972 --> 12:39.391
WOMAN: Anybody home?

12:39.474 --> 12:42.852
Oh, Molly,
I know we're early, but I...

12:46.231 --> 12:48.108
I'm afraid the haggis is off.

13:06.001 --> 13:07.793
ARCHIE: How bad is he?

13:07.877 --> 13:10.964
He'll not make it
through another winter,
that's for sure.

13:11.048 --> 13:14.885
And we need to do it today,
I will not let
the beast suffer.

13:14.967 --> 13:19.305
-Well, I'd like to be
the one who takes the shot.
-Of course.

13:19.389 --> 13:21.641
Right, let's get started.

13:24.519 --> 13:28.315
Oh, before I forget,
you don't know
a Paul Bowman, do you?

13:28.398 --> 13:30.192
Never heard of him.

13:30.275 --> 13:34.571
Well, I met him earlier
and we just passed
him in the Land Rover.

13:34.654 --> 13:37.574
Where is the Land Rover?

13:37.657 --> 13:40.118
Um, it's a wee bit stuck.

13:41.912 --> 13:46.583
Duncan, if you were a stag,
we would have
you culled by now.

13:46.666 --> 13:49.376
-Bowman you said?
-Yeah.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.338
No, never heard of him.

13:53.924 --> 13:57.927
-Have I got it all?
-Yeah, there,
you look as good as new.

13:59.513 --> 14:03.183
You know, I always
remember the first time
we came here,

14:03.266 --> 14:08.646
Zara and Archie racing through
here, her in her best frock
and him in his short trousers.

14:08.730 --> 14:12.609
-Mother.
-What was it you used to play?
Kiss, chase.

14:12.692 --> 14:14.402
(CHUCKLING)

14:14.486 --> 14:18.614
-Oh, aye?
And did he ever catch you?
-He was the one running away.

14:21.243 --> 14:25.956
There we are.
Yes, my late husband,
Gerald, and I, we...

14:26.039 --> 14:31.086
We always hoped that Zara
and Archie might have, um...
Never mind.

14:31.169 --> 14:32.629
How is your husband?

14:32.713 --> 14:36.967
Still running but he
lets me catch him sometimes.

14:37.050 --> 14:40.845
Zara, bless her,
has given up chasing.
Haven't you, poppet?

14:42.930 --> 14:45.808
-Sorry about
the early arrival.
-It's fine.

14:45.892 --> 14:49.271
-Isn't it, Lexie?
-Absolutely.

14:49.353 --> 14:51.398
Zara may have given
up on the man hunt,

14:51.480 --> 14:54.234
but I thought if I
was finally going
to find a new husband,

14:54.317 --> 14:57.612
I should get along early
to avoid disappointment.

15:00.114 --> 15:05.912
-ZARA: We're not
in your way, are we?
-No. Not at all

15:05.996 --> 15:09.249
I know from all the functions
I've arranged, just when you
think it's all in hand,

15:09.332 --> 15:11.960
that's when
the little problems
seem to pop up out of nowhere.

15:12.043 --> 15:13.669
Don't they just.

15:16.465 --> 15:19.467
We do so always love
coming to visit Glenbogle.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.804
And we love having you.
You mustn't leave
it so long next time.

15:22.888 --> 15:26.808
And I can see Archie's
done well for himself
with you, Lexie.

15:26.892 --> 15:31.313
Perhaps you should have a word
with Zara later, pass on your
secret for success.

15:31.396 --> 15:33.648
Well, then it wouldn't
be a secret any more.

15:33.731 --> 15:36.359
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got flowers to sort out,

15:36.443 --> 15:39.571
wine to move and
a kitchen to de-haggis.

15:42.699 --> 15:47.286
One can never have
too much time to get
ready for these occasions.

15:47.369 --> 15:49.122
Clearly not.

15:49.206 --> 15:53.376
And as you can see, Molly,
Zara is not blessed with
Lexie's natural beauty.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.754
Look, if a girl is going to
catch the right chap, she's

15:55.836 --> 15:58.548
got to have the right face to
do it with.

15:58.632 --> 16:02.385
And if you haven't
got one of your own,
paint it on.

16:03.929 --> 16:07.015
I think that Zara has
a very nice natural look.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.475
(FAINT SHOUTING)

16:08.558 --> 16:11.436
Can I hear someone calling?

16:19.361 --> 16:21.029
Just the wind.

16:26.076 --> 16:28.578
Help! Help!

16:33.458 --> 16:36.461
Maybe bouncing around
isn't such a good idea.

16:36.545 --> 16:41.007
But somebody's bound to cross
the landing sooner or later,
then they'll hear.

16:41.091 --> 16:45.637
Or maybe they'll see you
when you come
crashing through the ceiling.

16:45.721 --> 16:48.682
-What exactly
are you implying?
-Nothing.

16:48.764 --> 16:51.810
Well, I may be a little stout
but I think it's
a bit off to point it out.

16:51.893 --> 16:54.187
That's not what I meant.

16:54.271 --> 16:57.774
Nanny always said I was built
for carrying responsibilities.

16:57.858 --> 16:59.735
Nanny?

17:02.445 --> 17:04.865
(SIGHING)

17:04.948 --> 17:08.993
And, just for the record,
I am only a few pounds heavier

17:09.077 --> 17:13.915
than the official
national average
for my height and build.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.877
I just happen to be
three inches shorter.

17:19.253 --> 17:23.508
We have guests
and some assistance
would be appreciated.

17:23.592 --> 17:27.054
-Ah, that box there I wanted.
-Oh, and I thought we'd...

17:27.137 --> 17:29.723
(SHOUTING IN PAIN)

17:29.806 --> 17:32.267
I do hope that
isn't too painful.

17:41.234 --> 17:45.571
Worse things in
the world than being guardian
to all this, wouldn't you say?

17:45.655 --> 17:48.575
I can't believe I ever thought
I could live away from here.

17:48.657 --> 17:53.119
Ach, well, sometimes in our
lives we are after
different things, son.

17:56.999 --> 18:00.252
Remind me never to take
this for granted, Golly.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.387
Caring, gentle, understanding,
you could have been a nurse,
couldn't you?

18:08.469 --> 18:11.598
-Me? I doubt it.
-You have all the qualities.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.517
(GASPING)

18:13.600 --> 18:17.478
-Sorry.
-Didn't feel a thing.

18:17.562 --> 18:22.359
Molly, I've got
a jolly large splinter.

18:22.441 --> 18:24.903
-Where?
-Just there. It's huge.

18:24.986 --> 18:27.572
Oh, Kilwillie,
don't be such a baby.

18:29.866 --> 18:32.035
-Broken?
-Just bruised.

18:32.119 --> 18:36.789
-Oh, well, never mind.
-Would you like me to
take a look at your splinter?

19:18.247 --> 19:22.627
Okay, son. A good
clean shot to the heart.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.425
(GUN FIRING)

19:28.508 --> 19:31.470
What are you doing?
I had the perfect shot.

19:46.108 --> 19:48.445
I'm told you're
looking for me.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.411
If you're the man in
this photo, then yes.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.540
-Megan.
-My mother.

20:05.670 --> 20:08.173
-Duncan.
-Aye?

20:08.255 --> 20:13.344
Away and see if you can drive
Big Eric up to the point
on the hill there.

20:13.428 --> 20:17.515
In 10 minutes, we'll cross to
the trees and see if we can
get a clear shot.

20:20.102 --> 20:23.522
-You'll be
upwind of him there.
-Just do it, Duncan.

20:41.456 --> 20:46.210
I knew there was a chance you
would come up here some day,
but not this way.

20:48.004 --> 20:51.091
I found this in Mum's things.

20:51.173 --> 20:55.679
Three weeks ago I
came home from leave
to find her dying.

20:55.762 --> 20:58.305
Alone in her flat.

20:58.389 --> 21:02.352
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

21:02.436 --> 21:05.479
It's from me solicitors.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.274
Read it.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.860
Read it.

21:23.540 --> 21:29.921
"We acknowledge your desire to
keep independence and sole
responsibility for the child.

21:30.005 --> 21:34.091
"The Glenbogle
estate representing
the interests of the father."

21:40.514 --> 21:43.226
He's your son.

21:43.309 --> 21:47.481
My mother didn't want anything
from you back then
and neither do I.

21:47.564 --> 21:52.360
-It's not that simple.
-All I came here for
is to see my father.

21:52.444 --> 21:56.656
See the man who walked into my
mother's life 30 odd years ago
and left her with a son.

21:56.740 --> 22:01.285
-I said it's not that simple.
-Then tell me
you're not my father.

22:01.369 --> 22:04.789
Tell me that and I'll
leave here and not come back.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.758
We've got a stag to shoot.

22:14.840 --> 22:18.095
Golly,
you have to deal with this.

22:18.178 --> 22:20.513
There's a storm
away in the mountains.

22:20.596 --> 22:24.643
I want us
finished and off the hill
before it decides to blow.

22:37.989 --> 22:41.076
Thank you. There you go.

22:42.411 --> 22:44.663
-Here we are.
-Oh!

22:44.746 --> 22:47.207
-Help yourselves.
-Oh, that's splendid.

22:47.290 --> 22:49.376
KILWILLIE: An army
marches on its stomach.

22:49.459 --> 22:54.088
You shouldn't have gone to all
this trouble. You have enough
to do as it is.

22:54.171 --> 22:56.133
I feel dreadful
about the haggis.

22:56.216 --> 22:58.677
The best thing you can do
is take care of our guests.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.179
-Roger.
-Making the haggis is
the last thing I needed.

23:01.262 --> 23:04.890
I don't know when
I'm gonna have time
to decorate this hall.

23:04.975 --> 23:06.308
(MOLLY SIGHING)

23:06.393 --> 23:09.354
I knew I was right
to get here early.

23:09.438 --> 23:12.107
Please tell me he's single.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.984
-I'm not sure.
-You must know.

23:14.067 --> 23:15.986
Er, widowed I think.

23:18.196 --> 23:21.282
Now he would fit rather nicely
alongside my fireside.

23:21.365 --> 23:24.828
Oh, I shouldn't set your cap
at just the one chap until

23:24.910 --> 23:27.372
you've seen all the available
candidates.

23:27.456 --> 23:29.915
Yes,
I'm sure you're right, dear.

23:32.127 --> 23:34.504
You seem to have
forgotten my lemon.

23:34.588 --> 23:36.256
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:36.338 --> 23:38.592
I'll forgive you.

23:38.675 --> 23:40.135
Just this once.

23:54.483 --> 23:59.029
The last ball we gave
had a Damien Hirst theme.
It looked absolutely fabulous.

23:59.112 --> 24:02.449
Oh, I'm sure it did.

24:02.532 --> 24:06.578
-You've got quite
a gift for interior design.
-Oh, thank you, Molly.

24:06.661 --> 24:07.996
I meant Zara.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.415
Well, one doesn't like
to blow one's own trumpet.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.377
If I didn't blow mine,
nobody else would.

24:20.550 --> 24:25.889
Oh, would you come into the
hall for a moment? I've had
an idea. Excuse us, Kilwillie.

24:44.281 --> 24:49.579
I know things have to be
dealt with, but not up here,
not like this.

24:49.663 --> 24:53.250
Why are you so scared
of admitting the truth?

24:53.333 --> 24:56.545
I'm not planning on
claiming the family jewels.

25:00.841 --> 25:02.217
Talk to me.

25:09.223 --> 25:12.477
Then I got
the answer I came for.

25:12.561 --> 25:14.979
-Golly, you can't just
let him go like this.
-Get out of my way.

25:15.062 --> 25:16.898
-No.
-I've never had a father

25:16.982 --> 25:20.277
and I don't
particularly want one.

25:20.360 --> 25:24.406
-Not one like him,
that's for sure.
-I'm not your father, Paul.

25:26.490 --> 25:28.326
Hector MacDonald was.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.872
You and Archie are brothers.

25:37.461 --> 25:40.130
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

25:42.090 --> 25:44.593
Kilwillie, could you go down
to the cellar for me, please,

25:44.676 --> 25:46.595
and see if you can find
something special?

25:46.678 --> 25:49.388
-You know, for the toasts.
-Course.

25:49.473 --> 25:51.600
(SIGHING) Warm work that.

25:51.683 --> 25:56.271
Well, if you get too hot,
you could always
take your shirt off.

25:56.354 --> 25:59.691
I think perhaps
he needs a hand,
these bottles can be heavy.

26:06.740 --> 26:09.743
You do realise that
the hunting season
finishes today?

26:09.826 --> 26:15.165
Oh, don't worry dear, I plan
to have my stag stuffed and
mounted by midnight.

26:22.339 --> 26:26.760
As far as
Hector was concerned,
Molly had left him.

26:26.843 --> 26:31.765
Poor woman felt trapped up
here, no friends,
nothing, different world.

26:31.848 --> 26:35.142
She felt she had to get away,
she went back to London.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.228
Hector had no idea
if she would
ever be coming back.

26:37.312 --> 26:39.731
Oh,
so he ran off to my mother?

26:39.815 --> 26:41.650
Look...

26:41.733 --> 26:46.238
I'm not trying to
excuse Hector's actions,
no more did he.

26:46.321 --> 26:52.369
Lived with the shame of it
all his days but the man was
shattered, Molly had left.

26:52.452 --> 26:53.995
He disappeared.

26:56.039 --> 27:00.210
I tracked him down to
Edinburgh, it's where that
photo was taken.

27:00.293 --> 27:06.633
Anyway, by the time he got
back here it was all over
between them. And then...

27:06.717 --> 27:08.468
Megan discovered
she was pregnant.

27:08.552 --> 27:10.679
He wanted to do the right
thing by her, wanted to make

27:10.762 --> 27:13.598
sure that she wanted for
nothing,

27:13.681 --> 27:18.937
but she found out that he was
married, she didn't want to
know him any more.

27:21.564 --> 27:23.525
I was sworn to secrecy.

27:25.485 --> 27:30.490
And the family solicitors
drew a line under the matter
with that letter.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.287
I don't believe this.

27:35.370 --> 27:38.038
Hector made me swear, Archie.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.875
My father owned all this.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.085
So everything I have
ever known is a lie, is it?

27:43.170 --> 27:45.589
You are still Hector's son.

27:45.672 --> 27:47.674
And so is he.

27:47.758 --> 27:52.054
If I hadn't come here,
no one would
ever have told me.

27:52.137 --> 27:55.222
That was the way your
mother wanted it to be.

27:57.308 --> 27:59.644
(PANTING)

27:59.728 --> 28:02.481
What are you doing?

28:02.564 --> 28:05.442
I got him round to
exactly where you wanted him.

28:05.525 --> 28:08.819
You had the perfect shot,
why didn't you take it?

28:13.824 --> 28:17.913
I came up here
to shoot Big Eric
and that's what I'm gonna do.

28:17.995 --> 28:21.041
Archie.

28:21.124 --> 28:25.252
-Does somebody want to
tell me what's going on?
-Not now, Duncan.

28:35.930 --> 28:39.601
I can't believe
the girls from the pub
aren't even here yet.

28:43.104 --> 28:45.649
-What have you done?
-Oriental chic.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.532
-This is my hallway.
-Molly asked if I could help.

28:53.615 --> 28:55.867
MOLLY: Well, you said you
didn't have time to decorate

28:55.950 --> 28:57.911
the hall, so I asked Zara to
do it.

28:57.994 --> 29:00.539
This is very now,
I can assure you.

29:03.250 --> 29:06.795
When the guests arrive,
this will be
the first thing that they see.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.213
Mmm-hmm.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.428
This isn't Glenbogle.

29:14.510 --> 29:17.472
This isn't me.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.515
KILWILLIE: Well, I...

29:19.598 --> 29:22.644
I suppose we could
lose some of the candles.

29:25.647 --> 29:26.898
Lexie.

29:38.117 --> 29:40.370
We should try and drive him
across the glen.

29:40.454 --> 29:43.789
Keep ourselves well below
the skyline.

29:43.873 --> 29:48.420
-Nah, he's heading for cover.
-No,
no, he'll not leave the herd.

29:48.503 --> 29:52.423
(SCOFFING) He's hurt.
He wants cover.

29:54.092 --> 29:56.136
I think Duncan's right.

30:00.849 --> 30:02.267
(BELLOWING)

30:04.436 --> 30:07.396
If he makes it to those trees,
you'll not get a shot.

30:07.480 --> 30:13.361
Nah, we've been
keeping him moving all day,
he's tired.

30:13.445 --> 30:18.366
We should let him make it to
the trees, then we can take
the shot on our terms.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.959
Okay. Let's do it.

30:40.304 --> 30:42.015
Can I talk to you?

30:43.683 --> 30:45.351
We're losing light.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.030
(SIGHING) Oh, dear, no.

30:57.114 --> 30:59.116
Far too demure.

30:59.199 --> 31:01.117
(LAUGHING)

31:01.201 --> 31:06.665
Well, he's obviously
seen a thing or two,
but I like worldly men.

31:06.747 --> 31:09.583
I'm surprised you've not
taken a shine to him, Molly.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.212
-Me?
-Now that you're a free agent.

31:12.295 --> 31:16.717
It must have crossed
your mind. Go on, admit it.

31:16.799 --> 31:19.553
No, well, I mean...

31:19.635 --> 31:24.850
Yes, well, just don't go
trying anything this evening.
I've got first dibs.

31:24.933 --> 31:29.521
(SIGHING) Aha, the black.

31:29.603 --> 31:33.190
Black, black, black, the
black, the black, the black.

(GROWLING PLAYFULLY)

31:37.779 --> 31:42.909
No, the booking was for today,
not for next week.

31:42.993 --> 31:47.122
But, Dougal, I've got
over a hundred guests,
I need those girls.

31:48.749 --> 31:52.501
A wedding, oh, right, well,
you're sorry and I'm stuffed.

31:54.754 --> 31:56.381
Oh, Lexie.

32:25.368 --> 32:27.412
I remember my first stag.

32:29.372 --> 32:30.665
I was 13.

32:32.959 --> 32:35.003
I didn't want to come.

32:37.381 --> 32:41.842
But there was no way my father
was gonna have a son
who couldn't stalk.

32:46.556 --> 32:49.476
I was never supposed
to be the oldest son.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.772
This isn't my place.

32:58.235 --> 33:00.486
Jamie should be here, not me.

33:24.553 --> 33:26.346
Someone has unplugged it.

33:26.430 --> 33:29.516
I can't risk serving food to
guests that's been lying
around unchilled.

33:29.599 --> 33:32.728
-Where was it plugged in?
-In the kitchen.

33:35.021 --> 33:37.648
-By the food mixer?
-Yes.

33:37.733 --> 33:40.402
Well,
I'm sure it'll be all right.

33:40.484 --> 33:45.240
Okay, there you go.
Just don't come blaming me
when the salmonella kicks in.

33:50.328 --> 33:53.623
No chance of a snack,
is there, to keep us going?

(PLATTER CRASHING)

Okay, just breathe in,
hold it, let it out slowly
when you squeeze the trigger.

Archie?

34:51.972 --> 34:54.684
Okay, son, take the shot.

Clean shot.

35:10.658 --> 35:12.119
Perfect shot.

35:14.037 --> 35:16.957
I'll go and get
the pony from the shelter.

35:39.521 --> 35:41.481
We may share a father,

35:44.109 --> 35:47.027
but I only have one brother.

35:47.111 --> 35:49.406
And he died 16 years ago.

36:01.877 --> 36:03.336
MOLLY: Lexie?

36:15.598 --> 36:18.935
Okay, okay, you were right.
I took on too much.

36:22.314 --> 36:28.236
Lexie, darling, this evening
isn't about the food
we eat, or the decor,

36:28.320 --> 36:30.781
it's about you and Glenbogle
and saying thank you to

36:30.864 --> 36:33.867
everybody for a wonderful
season.

36:35.619 --> 36:38.830
I just wanted it to be
as good as it always is.

36:41.583 --> 36:46.338
Well, things don't
always have to be the same
to be good, do they?

36:46.420 --> 36:48.298
No, I suppose not.

36:52.176 --> 36:58.016
Well,
maybe it's time for something
a bit more Lexie MacDonald.

37:04.313 --> 37:06.024
Shall I gather the troops?

37:06.108 --> 37:09.820
This is gonna be one Gillie's
Ball that Glenbogle
will not forget.

37:09.903 --> 37:12.905
Okay, Kilwillie, could you
clear the front of the house,

37:12.989 --> 37:14.574
please, of any vehicles that
are there?

37:14.658 --> 37:18.661
Andrew, could you set up
some car parking
spaces in the field?

37:18.745 --> 37:21.832
-Mmm-Hmm.
-I could help him.

37:21.915 --> 37:27.713
Oh, but, hadn't he better go
with someone who knows
the layout of the estate?

37:27.796 --> 37:32.174
Okay, yup, well, Merilyn and
Zara, could you both
come with me, please?

37:43.019 --> 37:44.855
Keeping an eye on me?

37:56.908 --> 37:59.202
DUNCAN: Eric ended up

eh, Golly?

37:59.285 --> 38:03.749
Yeah, well done, son.
You were right
and I was wrong.

I'll just deny it.

you're gonna tell me
what's going on?

You'll find out soon enough.

38:35.989 --> 38:38.033
I don't want my
mother knowing about this.

38:38.116 --> 38:42.286
I don't think it's something
you're going to be
able to keep from her.

38:42.370 --> 38:44.413
Why not? You kept it
from me for long enough.

38:44.498 --> 38:47.917
And that was wrong.
Look how hurt
you've been by it.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.798
It was wrong, Archie.

38:52.881 --> 38:55.550
I want him away
from Glenbogle.

It's late, son.
He's nowhere to go.

rush in and ruin it.

-You are so clever.

39:47.977 --> 39:50.021
I wish I'd thought of it.

I want your word that you
won't cause any trouble.

Hi. While you've been out
having fun all day, we have
been working very hard.

40:19.634 --> 40:23.555
-Yeah, Paul.
-Lexie. I see you got Golly.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.849
So, are you gonna
come and join us, Paul?

40:25.931 --> 40:29.686
-I don't think so.
-No arguments.

40:29.770 --> 40:32.022
-I'd better be off.
-Lexie!

Archie, tell Paul
that he's got to come
and join in the fun.

it's compulsory at
a Lexie MacDonald event.

gillie for the ball.

better and better.

wanted to find my father

a room in the village.
