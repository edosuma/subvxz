<i>We are also going
to be talking...</i>

00:42.626 --> 00:45.378
<i>with Kim Alexander on following
the money trail.</i>

01:17.286 --> 01:20.079
Getting broken in by Senor
Rape-ez here, huh?

01:20.164 --> 01:22.123
Yeah? You having a good day?

01:22.207 --> 01:23.400
- Yeah.
- I'll break it down

01:23.440 --> 01:24.125
for you, alright?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.085
All you really need to know is...

01:26.170 --> 01:28.629
among this whole sea
of brown skin...

01:28.714 --> 01:31.466
a Mexican man hates a Honduran,

01:31.550 --> 01:33.509
just like a Guatemalan
hates a Salvadoran.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.678
They're really not all the same.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.348
Everybody's dealin' dope,
twenty-four/seven.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.517
It's an open-air supermarket.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.604
Everybody's got a woodstick
for the LAPD.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.814
Typical, onionhead gangbanger.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.358
It'll be a Mexican. You know.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.569
A Patuso or a Fuego.
And all this shit,

01:51.653 --> 01:53.696
it all derives from something
real important,

01:53.781 --> 01:57.617
like what little berg in the CuliacÃ¡n
Uncle Juanito comes from.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.286
How many fuckin' coyotes
the dirty little hamster

02:00.370 --> 02:02.872
bred with on his journey up
here to the promised land.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.081
What about the scandal?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.002
The scandal's bullshit.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.049
Two dickhead cops got embroiled

02:13.133 --> 02:15.551
in some fuck up.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.553
Ratted out an entire
sweet division...

02:17.638 --> 02:19.889
to save their own wretched asses.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.392
The D.A.'s office is running
scared, afraid to file,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.020
afraid not to exonerate
en-fucking-masse.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.732
Now you got a lot of hopped-up
Rodney King wannabe beaners

02:29.817 --> 02:31.984
making whoop-de-doo of their own,

02:32.069 --> 02:34.946
with get-out-of-jail-free cards
and a pile of county cash.

02:35.030 --> 02:41.911
This used to be a glorious soldier's
department. Now it's... you.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.541
What's funny?

02:46.625 --> 02:48.835
Private Hatchet woman over
here is inquiring

02:48.919 --> 02:50.461
about the scandal of the century.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.256
You didn't touch your fries.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.633
What? Oh.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.240
I had a couple of them, but
I got a cholesterol thing.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.178
Why, you want them?

02:59.263 --> 03:02.098
No, you want them. Finish it.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.978
I can't... I don't
eat French fries.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.354
Well, then you shouldn't
have ordered them.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.482
Finish those fries.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.611
Dave hates wasting food.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.946
You never see him eat, but...

03:17.030 --> 03:18.614
he hates wasting food.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.157
If you keep going like this,

03:20.242 --> 03:23.870
you're gonna look like a crackhead.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.038
<i>Munch, munch,
cowgirl. C'mon.</i>

03:26.123 --> 03:28.332
A very attractive crackhead,
mind you.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.959
<i>You makin' eyes at me?</i>

03:30.043 --> 03:31.377
You want one?

03:31.461 --> 03:32.879
No, no, no. You're doin' good.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.672
I stay healthy.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.008
Finish those fries if you
wanna make probation.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.176
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.346
Your dad ever discipline you?

03:43.307 --> 03:45.016
Huh?

03:46.101 --> 03:47.643
No, sir.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.937
I never met my father.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.649
You never met him. Why?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.818
He wasn't around.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.120
<i>General!</i>

04:06.204 --> 04:07.872
<i>You guys make a great couple.</i>

04:07.956 --> 04:09.415
<i>I was just bull-shitting you.</i>

04:10.459 --> 04:11.834
Thanks, boss.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.795
There you go. Eat up. Eat up.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.469
You aim for the shortest wetback,
you watch him skedaddle...

04:21.553 --> 04:25.348
plow the dice and the Schlitz
Malt Liquor cans...

04:25.432 --> 04:27.224
and hit your siren in farewell.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.768
Let's see what we've got.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.229
Wooo!

04:33.482 --> 04:34.440
Green cards!

04:42.491 --> 04:44.367
Yeah, you'll get the hang of it.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.078
- Aren't you worried?
- About?

04:47.162 --> 04:49.914
You'll get a 128?

04:49.998 --> 04:54.627
Okay, listen. This is the most
important thing I've told you so far.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.964
Everything you learned at
the Academy is bullshit.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.716
An Illegal is just a sick bird.

05:00.801 --> 05:05.596
This is some military occupation,
kid. Emergency law.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.057
Alright, let's have some fun.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.900
What went on here?

05:17.985 --> 05:20.903
Caught him boosting
ephedrine and propyl alcohol.

05:21.947 --> 05:22.655
What happened?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.739
Ow.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.573
He hit you?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.866
Yeah.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.995
You hit him? Tough guy?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.206
Step outside, will you?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.834
- Outside?
- Yeah, outside.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.504
Hey, will you step out, too?

05:38.588 --> 05:41.799
- I don't know, sir.
- Now!

05:41.883 --> 05:44.176
And shut that door behind you.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.188
Nice tat.

05:59.901 --> 06:04.030
Now, you're cooking crank
out of somebody's garage.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.323
I don't know where that
garage is, but you do.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.618
Now where oh where could
that damn garage be?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.788
I don't see it, but you do.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.749
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

06:17.294 --> 06:21.881
Okay, so now you have petty
theft, assault...

06:21.965 --> 06:23.758
I'm sure you have at
least four priors.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.802
That's a violation and mandatory
bullet, compadre.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.680
Now, you give me that address,
and it all goes away.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.020
What's the address?

06:36.104 --> 06:39.982
I don't want to hurt
you. I don't. I like you.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.864
- You don't know anything?
- Don't know, nothin'.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.450
Tell me where it is. C'mon.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.411
I don't know where it fuckin'
is. I don't fuckin' know!

07:02.005 --> 07:04.340
That's your man.

07:04.424 --> 07:08.260
- What?
- Meth lab. 41 East Cesar Chavez.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.846
That's it? No explanation, Dave?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.807
- Hey, Dave, question?
- Yeah?

07:12.891 --> 07:15.017
Circuit Court appeals for illegal
search and seizure.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.103
Give me a precedent.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.981
Cuthbert versus Ingleside County,
Virginia, 1966. Look it up.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.067
You have all those cases memorized?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.820
Sure, and if I don't, I make it up.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.989
...takes place in this
great, great country of ours. C'mon.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.720
<i>But let's imagine if you will
what might be happening</i>

07:31.760 --> 07:33.077
<i>out there beyond America,</i>

07:33.161 --> 07:36.789
<i>beyond our word, because I'm
sure this will leave you</i>

07:36.873 --> 07:38.624
<i>simply breathless.</i>

07:38.708 --> 07:40.543
<i>It's my opinion that when we hear</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:43.295
<i>of some bizarre or repugnant
or deviant story</i>

07:43.380 --> 07:45.422
<i>like the one you are
about to hear, well,</i>

07:45.507 --> 07:47.675
<i>it's not that the world suddenly...</i>

08:03.024 --> 08:05.192
- Hey, ladies.
- Dave.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.486
- Hey, babe.
- Any wine for me?

08:07.571 --> 08:10.823
- Dinner's at 6:30.
- I'll be there.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.043
Daddy!

08:23.128 --> 08:24.420
Hey.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.798
- How are my girls?
- Great.

08:27.883 --> 08:31.927
Yeah? No hello, Helen?

08:33.597 --> 08:37.725
- Hey, Date Rape.
- Don't call me that.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.400
<i>Something about it that's...</i>

09:07.672 --> 09:10.549
What's up, monkey?

09:10.634 --> 09:12.885
Helen has a question.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.348
Maybe you have a question.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.476
We both have a question.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.521
Helen's studying genetics
in school,

09:24.606 --> 09:26.273
and since our moms are sisters...

09:26.358 --> 09:29.735
and you're our dad, we
were just wondering...

09:29.819 --> 09:31.528
if we were inbred.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.240
It's not funny!

09:34.324 --> 09:37.701
No, sorry. Sorry.

09:37.786 --> 09:42.498
No, I married your moms consecutively,
not concurrently...

09:42.582 --> 09:48.128
which makes you and Helen first
cousins and sisters, half.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.840
It's all perfectly legal

09:51.925 --> 09:55.469
and genetically up to insurance
industry standards.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.390
You're not gonna turn into
mongoloids any time soon,

09:59.474 --> 10:01.058
if that's what you're asking.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.811
You're not inbred. You
know what you are?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.897
You're native.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.520
- It's sad.
- They're dead. They can't

10:08.560 --> 10:09.191
commit suicide.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.818
Is this a new TV show?

10:10.902 --> 10:12.778
No. I'm trying
to make it up.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.364
It sounds like it.
The ghosts are depressed?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.366
No. I was thinking
about maybe making it

10:17.450 --> 10:19.159
a graphic novel or something.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.078
You could do that.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.122
- Suicidal ghosts.
- I would like to see that.

10:23.206 --> 10:28.460
They want out. So these people,
who I think are actually...

10:28.545 --> 10:33.215
Barbara, where's the olives?
There's no olives.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.175
I'm sorry. I don't know.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.761
I think we're out, I'll look,
but I think we're out.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.222
They're complete barbarians.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.057
And they have just as many
problems as we do.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.726
Why do you let her put
that on the wall?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.769
Helen's poster?

10:45.854 --> 10:47.646
Yeah, that little collage.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.523
It's amazing. She's been
working hard on it.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.192
She's worked on that thing
for three weeks.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.240
- It's amazing, is
it? It is amazing.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.156
- It's quite something.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.116
I think it should
be in a museum.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.451
That's what I think.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.915
Don't you tell your mother
you learned that from me.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.126
Here, give me your plate, Marg.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.337
And that's not okay
if that's a bowl.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.050
May I sleep with you tonight?

11:19.387 --> 11:23.098
I have sketching to do. Please.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.560
So that's not a no, is it?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.771
That would be a very
nice way to say no.

11:28.855 --> 11:33.484
What about a nice way to say yes?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.986
What about after your sketching?

11:36.071 --> 11:40.324
No, no...

11:40.408 --> 11:42.159
I'm gonna be up all night.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.996
Aunt Bee, is there
any more broccoli?

11:46.081 --> 11:49.124
Are you asking for more vegetables?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.418
Only broccoli because I
like eating the stems.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.504
Helen, I'm curious about
that artwork you have...

11:53.588 --> 11:56.173
on the wall there.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.342
- What is it?
- What kind of a mother are you?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.386
- She's a broccoli hoarder.
- What does it mean?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.012
What does it mean...

12:02.097 --> 12:04.640
Yeah, what does that
mean? That collage?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.100
It's these little bits of paper,

12:06.184 --> 12:08.018
and you cut them out

12:08.103 --> 12:11.563
and you glue them together
and make another picture.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.316
Okay, so you have a
man's head and...

12:14.401 --> 12:18.904
a woman's heel digging
into his head and

12:18.988 --> 12:21.323
stepping on his mouth and...

12:21.408 --> 12:23.560
- It's art, Dave. It's art.
- We can be grateful

12:23.600 --> 12:24.326
that he noticed.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.162
...a naked woman with the blood
flowing from her vagina.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.373
Alright. Okay.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.280
- You have the C word prominently
displayed.

12:31.320 --> 12:31.792
- Alright.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.129
You have eyes. That's great.
What's the problem?

12:35.213 --> 12:38.132
What is the problem?
What is the problem?

12:38.216 --> 12:40.467
- Oh, let it be, would you?
- Margaret?

12:40.552 --> 12:42.469
Do you like her collage?

12:42.554 --> 12:43.887
I'll ask it. What is it?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.097
It just needs more color.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.515
More color.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.350
Like rainbows.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.645
Honey, how's your spaghetti?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.814
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.232
That's good.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.819
How is yours?

12:58.903 --> 13:01.488
It's very good, thank you.
You should try some.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.740
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.286
Do you want to cuddle later?

13:08.997 --> 13:11.039
I have a boyfriend.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.541
Cheat on him.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.877
Like you cheat on your taxes?

13:17.255 --> 13:19.798
I don't cheat on my taxes.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.009
Okay? You can't cheat on something

13:22.093 --> 13:24.678
you never committed to.

13:24.762 --> 13:29.099
How do you know how much you
pay for taxes anyway?

13:29.184 --> 13:33.770
I think I'm gonna go take a
walk, look for some olives.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.940
Come on. Would you sit and
have something to eat?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.901
He wouldn't be
like this if you guys

13:38.985 --> 13:39.902
weren't so hard on him.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.697
It's the truth.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.532
No, it's not the truth.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.409
He is too hard
on you, but still...

14:06.137 --> 14:09.056
And where
you go? That's right.

14:14.938 --> 14:19.316
Dave Brown's just too plain
a name for someone like me.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.527
What, you don't have a moniker?

14:21.611 --> 14:26.031
You don't have a moniker? Like
something your cop buddies call you?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.866
You know the lingo.

14:27.951 --> 14:32.287
Yeah, my brother was on the
San Berdoo Sheriff's.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.628
I got a little thing for cops.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.798
You don't have it for your brother?

14:42.882 --> 14:46.260
What, no! No!

14:48.096 --> 14:51.056
Nice!

14:53.476 --> 14:57.104
That was a very, very impressive...

14:57.188 --> 14:58.939
No, thank you. I don't smoke.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.858
- You don't smoke?
- No. I don't need it.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.277
Then that wasn't as impressive

15:03.361 --> 15:04.945
as it would have been.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.655
No, it was still a very
impressive trick.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.740
No smoking in here, sir.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.201
Jesus Christ.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.538
You used to let me smoke in here.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.581
Poor little rose.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.623
That's for you.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.085
Wow. I didn't get you anything.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.296
That's okay. You'll
think of something.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.970
So come on, tell me.
What's your moniker?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.805
What does it matter?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.724
Could tell me all I need
to know about you.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.685
You know, maybe a little bit more.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.065
Come on. Don't be shy. What
is it? Let me guess.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.235
Is it...

15:45.320 --> 15:46.653
"Roughhouse" Dave?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.698
Yeah? Or...

15:49.782 --> 15:51.116
I like that.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.785
Or "Bang Bang" Brown?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.831
"Date Rape" Dave.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.168
Why is that?

16:01.252 --> 16:03.295
Rumor from when I worked
Hollywood Sex...

16:03.379 --> 16:06.465
and I can't confirm it
and I won't deny it.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.093
So tell me.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.349
Maybe I killed a bad
guy, maybe I didn't.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.268
Either way, he got what he paid for

16:18.353 --> 16:21.480
and he'll never hurt another
woman ever again.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.819
Is that your foot?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.448
Yeah.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.664
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

16:38.748 --> 16:43.043
Okay, Do it again, do it
again, do it again.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.503
Woo!

17:34.846 --> 17:36.888
Oh, well.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.018
Hey, what's your fucking problem?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.352
Ow!

18:41.704 --> 18:44.748
<i>Brown was videotaped
severely beating a motorist</i>

18:44.832 --> 18:47.125
<i>named Shondell Parmallee in
what civil rights groups</i>

18:47.210 --> 18:49.961
<i>are calling "old school
L.A.P.D. Brutality"</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:53.089
<i>"revisited, revived,
and regurgitated."</i>

18:53.174 --> 18:55.801
<i>Local activists have launched
new attacks on the L.A.P.D.</i>

18:55.885 --> 18:58.053
<i>For its "culture of
racial misconduct"</i>

18:58.137 --> 19:00.180
<i>while Officer Brown remains
on limited duty</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:02.224
awaiting <i>possible disciplinary
action</i>

19:02.308 --> 19:04.684
<i>and pending civil lawsuits.</i>

19:04.769 --> 19:08.605
<i>The Shondell-gate matter is in the
early stages of investigation,</i>

19:08.689 --> 19:10.982
<i>as opposed to the Rampart Scandal,</i>

19:11.067 --> 19:13.610
<i>which as you know is a longstanding</i>

19:13.694 --> 19:18.448
<i>highly complex and
multifaceted issue</i>

19:18.533 --> 19:20.867
<i>- of great social import.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.954
<i>That's Bill B. For you. He got "highly
complex", "multifaceted"</i>

19:24.038 --> 19:26.456
<i>and "great social import"
into one sentence,</i>

19:26.541 --> 19:30.001
<i>and he didn't say a damn thing.</i>

19:30.086 --> 19:31.670
<i>I'll say this though.</i>

19:31.754 --> 19:33.463
<i>Our citizens are sick and tired.</i>

19:33.548 --> 19:35.340
Yeah?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.884
<i>...of the old way of
doing business.</i>

19:37.969 --> 19:39.886
How was your day?

19:39.971 --> 19:43.598
- Good. You?
- Pretty good.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.892
Is Helen still mad at me?

19:45.977 --> 19:49.437
I don't know. What are we watching?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.357
Just...

19:52.441 --> 19:55.151
yeah.

19:59.574 --> 20:00.657
Hey, did you do your homework?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.535
No.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.619
Great idea.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.708
How about we make this
a homework-free day?

20:09.792 --> 20:12.210
Not that you'll tell your mom.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.546
And we'll just watch television.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.172
Okay.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.133
What do you want to watch?
Is this good?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.726
<i>Jab it in and turn it.</i>

20:27.810 --> 20:29.853
<i>Suction. Suction!</i>

20:29.937 --> 20:32.939
<i>Now. Now!</i>

20:33.024 --> 20:34.858
<i>Where the hell is the blood?</i>

20:34.942 --> 20:38.069
<i>Grab that clamp and
push it back hard.</i>

20:38.154 --> 20:40.155
<i>- I can't.
- Come on!</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:45.035
No justice, no
peace! No justice, no peace!

21:05.306 --> 21:08.016
Hey, Dave.
Man of the hour.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.580
Date Rape?

21:33.918 --> 21:36.044
Thanks for making
us look good, Dave.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.212
You're the man! Good job!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.588
Thank you.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.341
Thighs apart, heads up.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.426
Have a nice day.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.436
What's the word, Chief?

21:55.606 --> 21:57.023
Close the door.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.235
What should I say?

22:00.319 --> 22:03.530
I'll say whatever I need to.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.701
Have you thought about retirement?

22:09.954 --> 22:13.164
No.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.500
In fact...

22:15.584 --> 22:18.336
if you force me to retire
and file on me,

22:18.421 --> 22:23.216
I'll plead not guilty, take it to
trial, and represent myself.

22:23.300 --> 22:28.263
I'll be playing to a mentally
deficient jury, so I'll lose

22:28.347 --> 22:31.016
though I'll work Vietnam
for all it's worth.

22:31.100 --> 22:36.062
I'll have PTSD, DDT,
TNT, Agent Orange

22:36.147 --> 22:38.523
and the Creeping Chinese
Crud before it's over,

22:38.607 --> 22:41.985
not to mention 24 years on the job.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.195
I'll draw a fine and a
suspended sentence.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.407
Court TV will broadcast
the whole thing.

22:47.491 --> 22:51.244
I'll have my own show on Fox
News inside one week.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.496
You'll be my first guest.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.123
So you have thought about it?

22:55.207 --> 22:59.294
I don't intend to retire,
Miss Confrey.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.379
All right.

23:01.464 --> 23:04.591
You know, Rampart has
become a shitstorm

23:04.675 --> 23:08.178
of such epic proportions,
legally and financially.

23:08.262 --> 23:11.681
We have bullshit police
brutality complaints

23:11.766 --> 23:14.350
bullshit felony evidence plants,

23:14.435 --> 23:17.103
wrong door fuck-ups,
we have them all.

23:17.188 --> 23:20.857
I have a ton of testimony,
solicited and unsolicited,

23:20.941 --> 23:24.069
that is ambiguous, if not
downright indecipherable.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.197
The county's going bankrupt
paying out lawsuit money.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.240
The D.A.'s office and L.A.P.D.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.784
Are hemorrhaging prestige,

23:30.868 --> 23:32.577
and many hardened criminals

23:32.661 --> 23:35.371
are out on the street way
before they should be.

23:35.456 --> 23:41.377
And now, Dave, we have
you to deal with.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.589
And we can't afford you.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.760
So how do we solve a problem like
Dave Brown? You tell me.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.179
I was under attack.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.599
I went after the suspect.
End of story.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.852
The tape doesn't show everything.
They never do.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.522
- I had to neutralize him.
- The tape shows you,

24:00.606 --> 24:02.857
brutally beating a man
almost to death.

24:05.402 --> 24:09.948
I think on his part it was assault
with a deadly weapon.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.200
You think he drove into
you on purpose?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.577
It was an assault with
a deadly weapon.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.621
- I got out of the car,
- It was an accident.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.200
- It was a collision.
- I intended to help

24:18.240 --> 24:18.832
that gentleman.

24:18.916 --> 24:22.085
He opened the door into me and ran.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.671
A lot of cops would have shot
him and got a medal.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.048
I took it easy on him, and
now I'm here before you.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.176
I don't think what we saw was
taking it easy on anyone.

24:30.261 --> 24:33.012
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but nine out of ten cops

24:33.097 --> 24:34.973
would have shot him right there.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.433
Do you admit that you overreacted?

24:37.518 --> 24:40.770
You seem to have everything
under control here,

24:40.855 --> 24:43.940
and I do appreciate
the opportunity.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.900
Just remember which side you're on.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.849
You're wearing a courtroom suit

25:17.933 --> 25:19.851
and you have litigator eyes.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.311
You here for me?

25:23.314 --> 25:25.064
No.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.276
Dave.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.069
Linda.

25:31.906 --> 25:35.408
Gordy!

25:35.492 --> 25:36.868
Isn't there a game on?

25:36.952 --> 25:38.369
I can't find the clicker.

25:38.454 --> 25:39.579
Yeah.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.042
Tell me you're not a lawyer.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.418
Okay, I'm not a lawyer.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.882
Are you selling something? Art?
Insurance? Pharmaceuticals?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.967
- What about real estate?
- Great.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.260
That's good.

25:54.345 --> 25:57.138
Yep. I'm in from Phoenix.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.891
My 87-year-old husband.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.320
He's taking a six-hour nap,
I'm taking a five-hour walk.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.394
How's that work for you?

26:03.479 --> 26:05.313
- Perfect.
- Good.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.066
- I am looking to refinance.
- That's good.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.860
Gordy.

26:10.945 --> 26:14.656
Anyway, thank you for
talking to me.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.783
Yeah, well, I figure I'll be safe.

26:16.867 --> 26:20.119
Everybody's watching
your every move.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.663
Now they're watching you.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.456
Maybe I like being watched.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.834
Well, I'm watching you.

26:30.547 --> 26:33.716
You are the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen...

26:35.052 --> 26:36.427
in this bar.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.272
What are you doing?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.608
I gotta go.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.193
Sneaking out on me?

27:34.278 --> 27:36.571
- You don't have to go.
- I gotta go.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.532
Come here. Give me that purse.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.409
I gotta go.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.203
- You don't have to go anywhere.
- I gotta go. I do.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.049
Okay, I gotta go. I have to go.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.633
You have to stay.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.188
- What's the matter?
- Jesus! Hartshorn.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.814
You too famous for me
all of a sudden?

28:11.899 --> 28:15.151
It's all deliberate provocation.

28:15.235 --> 28:20.198
They predicted your response,
and you fell for it.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.949
And who are "they?"

28:22.034 --> 28:26.079
"They?" They who don't like you.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.455
And why me?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.707
Because they don't like you.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.459
Look, what do I know?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.879
Maybe it's a coincidence
the camera was there.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.216
Look, if this is the gang
fucks, I don't mind.

28:38.300 --> 28:43.888
Or generic criminal scum, bogus
lawsuit settlement scum.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.306
Press scum.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.475
I can deal with scum.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.686
But if this is Rampart, L.A.P.D.,

28:50.771 --> 28:52.939
some fucking girly politician

28:53.023 --> 28:54.690
setting me up as a shit magnet

28:54.775 --> 28:57.235
to take the heat off
the fucking scandal,

28:57.319 --> 28:58.736
I gotta go deep into this.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.072
Look, what can I do?

29:01.156 --> 29:04.826
I am just a law-abiding retiree

29:04.910 --> 29:06.661
enjoying his golden years.

29:06.745 --> 29:11.165
Fuck you with the Mickey
Cohen routine, old man.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.584
You've got your fingers
in more Department twat

29:13.669 --> 29:15.795
han any active cop I know.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.589
Now, milk your contacts.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.426
I've got cash left from
the Harris job.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.219
Thanks for that, by the way.

29:23.303 --> 29:26.889
You could just stop
beating people up.

29:29.309 --> 29:32.145
This isn't your father's
L.A.P.D., you know.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.815
I know.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.360
It's more fun than a
barrel of monkeys.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.363
It is a barrel of monkeys.

29:45.367 --> 29:50.788
I'll get through it. I always do.

29:50.873 --> 29:55.001
You know, when you first
came in the Department,

29:55.085 --> 29:59.881
I wasn't certain whether you
were the dumbest rookie ever

29:59.965 --> 30:03.176
or the most bull-headed.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.345
I'm still debating it.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.848
That's what my old man
said about you,

30:08.932 --> 30:11.267
you were the most bullheaded
man he ever met.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.485
I should have filed
Murder One on you

30:20.569 --> 30:22.278
for that date-rape shooting.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.113
I would've booked him on
eleven counts of rape,

30:24.198 --> 30:27.283
Sodomy One, penetration with
a foreign weapon, etc.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.952
Gentlemen, can we talk about
the present circumstances?

30:30.037 --> 30:31.662
Fourteen years, tops.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.748
I'd say your punishment
breached legal status

30:33.832 --> 30:35.833
as well as moral code.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.377
"The law must acknowledge and
occasionally accommodate..."

30:38.462 --> 30:45.259
"the extraordinary vicissitudes of
justice." Judge D.T. Eagleton, 1946.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.636
I don't know that quote.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.471
You went to Cal State.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.639
At least I passed the bar.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.432
Knock it off.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.184
Barely, I'm told. Hence, politics.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.061
Should I break out the
milk and cookies here?

30:55.145 --> 30:58.105
Can we actually talk about
the possibility

30:58.190 --> 31:00.149
of your holding a press
conference together,

31:00.234 --> 31:02.235
addressing what's happened
with Mr. Parmallee,

31:02.319 --> 31:05.530
issuing an apology, and moving on?

31:05.614 --> 31:07.698
It would help if I'd done
something wrong.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.450
You've done nothing wrong.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.577
Someone planted a camera in my way.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.496
Maybe it's you, maybe
it's someone smart...

31:13.580 --> 31:16.123
definitely smarter than me,
because I don't stop to see

31:16.208 --> 31:19.043
if there's a photographer nearby

31:19.127 --> 31:21.504
when I do the people's dirty work.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.880
So you can't see yourself taking
any responsibility that

31:23.920 --> 31:24.840
moves us beyond this?

31:24.925 --> 31:28.302
No, because the only thing
that's wrong here

31:28.387 --> 31:31.305
is that a camera caught him
doing "police work."

31:33.308 --> 31:35.393
Is this a fucking joke to you?
You think it's funny?

31:35.477 --> 31:37.645
What is funny and peculiar
to me is how this office

31:37.729 --> 31:40.022
spends all its time going
after decent cops.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.902
Did you do it?

31:44.987 --> 31:47.280
Do what?

31:47.364 --> 31:50.920
Without admitting guilt or
complicity, did you actually

31:50.960 --> 31:52.118
kill that rapist?

31:52.202 --> 31:54.120
Alleged rapist?

31:54.204 --> 31:55.580
Did you do it?

31:58.208 --> 31:59.375
I don't live in the past.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.712
Is that a yes?

32:02.796 --> 32:07.008
Let me rephrase. If you were to have
done it, could you tell me why?

32:07.092 --> 32:10.803
So women would love me.

32:10.887 --> 32:14.807
I don't think that could
be the reason.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.143
I'm curious why you're so curious.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.230
We can talk about it this weekend.

32:21.315 --> 32:24.108
Give me a call.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.235
Brown, I have your number.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.530
I bet you do.

32:32.075 --> 32:36.412
<i>The stupidest trade
in the history of sports...</i>

33:20.248 --> 33:21.415
What did you do to the Captain?

33:24.211 --> 33:26.170
Come on, let's get back
to homework, hon.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.880
You have anything you
want to say to me?

33:27.964 --> 33:29.590
As in what?

33:29.675 --> 33:31.342
Why am I still collecting
a paycheck?

33:32.552 --> 33:34.804
Shondell skipped town.

33:34.888 --> 33:38.808
His nerves are shot. And that civil
lawsuit is still going forward.

33:38.892 --> 33:42.228
Someone upstairs is pulling
strings for you.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.021
Close the door.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.276
Shoot.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.029
<i>Close the door
with you on the outside.</i>

33:52.114 --> 33:55.116
I'm L.A.P.D. And I want
to stay L.A.P.D.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.868
That's the most important
thing for me.

33:57.953 --> 33:58.953
Why?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.913
Why what?

34:00.997 --> 34:03.874
I'm just asking. What if we
negotiated a settlement?

34:03.959 --> 34:07.294
Why is staying a cop the
most important thing?

34:07.379 --> 34:11.132
Because I'm a hard-charging
dutiful motherfucker,

34:11.216 --> 34:15.761
and I want to explicate the L.A.P.D.'s
somewhat hyperbolized misdeeds

34:15.846 --> 34:18.848
with true panache, regardless
of my alleged transgressions.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.141
Capiche?

34:21.226 --> 34:23.893
In other words, I have nowhere
else to go, so...

34:23.978 --> 34:27.022
if I get canned by the Department,
I swear to God,

34:27.107 --> 34:29.567
I'll study for the bar this
time, and come back here

34:29.650 --> 34:31.985
and work as your token fascist.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.993
Well...

34:39.077 --> 34:41.161
we'll need a retainer.
That's standard.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.081
- You're so cute.
- No, you're cute.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.784
- Have you seen my pick?
- No.

36:01.868 --> 36:04.119
- Are you still mad at me?
- Yeah.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.621
Why? What did I do?

36:05.705 --> 36:06.664
Whatever.

36:13.463 --> 36:16.715
You didn't even finish it.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.883
I just quit.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.927
Right.

36:20.011 --> 36:24.598
Hey. You remember when we used
to make up songs together?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.267
You know, like that one...

36:26.351 --> 36:28.394
<i>"I am you and you are me"</i>

36:28.478 --> 36:32.064
<i>- "We were always meant to be"</i>
- No.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.942
<i>"You are me and I am you"</i>

36:35.026 --> 36:37.640
<i>- "And we were meant
to see it through." - No.</i>

36:38.196 --> 36:40.155
You have to remember that.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.199
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.034
Let's take a walk.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.245
No, I'm busy.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.084
How long you been standing there?

36:54.880 --> 36:58.424
"You are me, I am you..."

37:06.057 --> 37:07.474
Get out.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.269
Get out, Dave.

37:42.052 --> 37:43.719
Yeah?

37:43.803 --> 37:47.056
Hey. Back in town?

37:48.642 --> 37:51.769
Yeah, it was fun.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.188
What do you mean, "the truth?"

38:02.906 --> 38:05.366
So you were lying
about everything?

38:05.450 --> 38:08.410
Dave, we were playing with
each other. C'mon.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.371
I liked the way you moved,
okay? That was it.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.791
It's like a John wayne thing
or something. I don't know.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.835
And I like to suck cock. So sue me.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.257
It seemed like a fine idea
at the time, didn't it?

38:22.342 --> 38:24.843
And you were asking for it, Dave.

38:24.928 --> 38:26.512
"Tell me you're not
a lawyer." I did.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.058
There's something you're
not telling me.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.852
What, that I hate the scum that
I represent? Okay, I told you.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.729
And when I was at the
D.A.'s office,

38:35.814 --> 38:37.856
at least I got to see
these guys go down.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.441
That's not it.

38:39.526 --> 38:43.362
Dave, I help criminals go free

38:43.446 --> 38:46.699
with County cash in their fuckin'
pockets because L.A.P.D. Fucks up.

38:46.783 --> 38:50.786
And 8 times out of 10, they're
right back at Rampart again.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.747
You're giving me a
closing statement.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.459
- You came looking for me.
- No, I didn't.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.379
What is it you're not telling me?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.047
You're either lying to me

39:02.132 --> 39:03.757
or you're withholding.
This is what I do.

39:13.518 --> 39:19.023
The guy that you killed,
the date-rape guy...

39:19.107 --> 39:22.480
I'm a defense attorney. And
I'm not supposed to, but

39:22.520 --> 39:24.028
I respect what you did.

39:30.452 --> 39:31.952
I'm sorry.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.084
No proof I killed anyone.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.048
I have daughters.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.969
I'm sorry.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.311
Can I sleep with you tonight?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.238
Yes.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.769
Nice surprise.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.482
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.735
Was she any good?

40:49.197 --> 40:49.947
She was.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.577
I've got to talk to you.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.246
Can't it wait?

40:57.330 --> 40:58.872
No.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.793
I'm kind of busy right now.

41:02.877 --> 41:06.380
We've got to put the houses
on the market.

41:06.464 --> 41:10.968
You've got to start thinking about
finding another place to live. Okay?

41:18.393 --> 41:21.311
No. That's not okay.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.732
You've got to do it.
This isn't working.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.317
You can't do that.

41:27.402 --> 41:28.986
Everybody living on
top of each other?

41:29.070 --> 41:31.363
You know it isn't working
as well as I do.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.491
- We've got to...
- You can't do that.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.244
We gotta go our own ways.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.205
You can't make the decisions
for us anymore.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.291
You've got to let us go.

41:42.375 --> 41:47.421
That's not acceptable. We've got
to keep everybody together.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.883
This is gonna blow over,
I promise you.

41:50.967 --> 41:54.845
We've been trying to keep us
together for a long time.

41:54.929 --> 41:58.098
But we've got to know
when we're licked.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.150
You've got to let us go.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.485
- Don't say that.
- You've got to let us go.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.362
I'll never let you go.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.866
- That's what I mean.
- I'll never let you go.

42:19.078 --> 42:22.164
<i>"You won't see me no more"</i>

42:22.248 --> 42:24.875
<i>" 'Cause I'm gonna stay
down here in L.A."</i>

42:26.628 --> 42:28.503
They all know someone like
me is more dangerous

42:28.588 --> 42:30.923
on the witness stand
than on the streets.

42:31.007 --> 42:32.758
Right?

42:32.842 --> 42:34.801
You gave them only one option.

42:34.886 --> 42:38.055
Top brass is gonna try to bury
the beating and the scandal

42:38.139 --> 42:40.599
and keep you as the sideshow.

42:40.683 --> 42:45.896
Keep the press guessing while they
investigate it into oblivion.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.774
Just stick to the "assault with
a deadly weapon" routine,

42:48.858 --> 42:50.525
and they won't touch you.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.986
I hope you're right.

42:53.071 --> 42:57.282
Meanwhile, I'm hemorrhaging cash.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.576
I know that twitch.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.669
Okay.

43:11.798 --> 43:14.508
There's gonna be a high-stakes
card game

43:14.592 --> 43:18.971
at the Crystal Market tonight.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.265
You didn't hear it from me, buddy.

43:21.349 --> 43:25.269
Thanks, Hart. You don't know
how much this means to me.

43:25.353 --> 43:30.023
I was gonna mention
it before, but...

43:30.108 --> 43:33.944
You know, man, the shape
you're in, jeez...

43:36.406 --> 43:40.158
I hate to see you bled
dry like that.

43:42.328 --> 43:44.496
How you doing?

43:46.332 --> 43:48.583
Are you okay?

43:48.668 --> 43:50.711
I'm fine.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.504
You're hanging in there.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.256
- Hanging in there.
- You're hanging in there.

43:54.340 --> 43:57.426
- You keeping it going.
- Yeah.

44:55.401 --> 44:59.529
Yeah, I'm in on this one, too.

44:59.614 --> 45:00.864
What have you got?

45:00.948 --> 45:02.074
I'm in on this one.

45:02.158 --> 45:05.619
Twenty on that one.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.466
Shut the fuck up!

45:19.550 --> 45:22.928
Don't even look up!
Look the fuck down!

45:23.012 --> 45:24.721
Stop moving, motherfuckers!

45:26.432 --> 45:27.641
Look the fuck down!

46:06.472 --> 46:09.266
No, fuck! I got kids, man, please!
Don't fucking kill me!

46:09.350 --> 46:10.684
Take off your mask.

46:10.768 --> 46:11.893
Take off your mask!

46:11.978 --> 46:13.603
Alright, man!

46:13.688 --> 46:15.480
Please don't fucking shoot
me, man! Please!

46:18.401 --> 46:19.860
Get some money out of there.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.445
Put it in your fucking pocket!

46:21.529 --> 46:24.156
Hurry up, goddamnit!

46:24.240 --> 46:26.783
Go! Go!

47:24.634 --> 47:27.469
<i>Brown is embroiled in a
high-stakes card game robbery</i>

47:27.553 --> 47:28.803
<i>that he apparently...</i>

47:32.683 --> 47:34.768
Is this a two
box or a three box.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.311
I can't remember what you said.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.612
That's the part that gets
me the most upset, Mom,

47:45.696 --> 47:47.239
is when you keep saying sorry.

47:47.323 --> 47:49.366
I know, I just feel bad.

47:49.450 --> 47:53.161
Why do you feel bad? You didn't
do anything. What did you do?

47:53.246 --> 47:54.996
That's the point. I
didn't do anything.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.404
I'm sorry about the reporters.

48:27.488 --> 48:29.489
Do you have cancer?

48:32.743 --> 48:35.745
Because if you don't, I'm done.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.373
We're done.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.335
He fired at me three times.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.921
I returned fire in self-defense.

48:45.006 --> 48:48.258
It was self-defense.
I swear to God.

48:53.472 --> 48:57.559
You need rest. You need to eat.

48:57.643 --> 49:01.646
I didn't know about the
card game. I swear.

49:05.401 --> 49:07.569
You need to set up shop
someplace else.

49:07.653 --> 49:11.114
Right now.

49:11.198 --> 49:13.491
I talked to Barb.

49:26.589 --> 49:29.758
Big Jim.

49:29.842 --> 49:33.428
The hookers that work the
bar weekends, your call.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.055
I notify Central Nightwatch
or I don't.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.391
You can't keep doing this, Dave.

49:38.476 --> 49:42.437
A fifth of scotch, a room
and a wake-up call.

49:42.521 --> 49:44.272
I could lose my job.

49:44.357 --> 49:46.816
At least you'll be on the outside.

49:58.287 --> 50:01.247
Your bun boy honked a Vice cop
at the Pink Parrot last night.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.416
He's got a parole hold, so no bail.

50:03.501 --> 50:06.086
Lorazapam and Phenobarb,
and it all goes away.

51:46.061 --> 51:49.230
We've taken a look at
your team's report.

51:49.315 --> 51:50.815
It's a pretty extensive package.

51:50.900 --> 51:53.943
Not germane to the issue, sir.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.279
I'd like the event to
be judged ad hoc.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.990
Empirical knowledge often
distorts the content

51:59.074 --> 52:02.535
of the act under scrutiny, sir.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.037
You're not making this easy.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.164
And you're not making friends here.

52:06.248 --> 52:10.043
I have all the friends I need at
this stage in my life, sir.

52:10.127 --> 52:13.004
Describe the events that
led up to your use

52:13.088 --> 52:15.048
of deadly force, Officer Brown.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.550
You're alive.
And an individual named...

52:17.635 --> 52:21.679
Jose Lancha Macias is dead.

52:21.764 --> 52:23.473
Now how did that occur?

52:28.395 --> 52:31.397
At approximately 2350
hours, I was parked

52:31.482 --> 52:34.943
near the southeast corner of Ewing
Street and Echo Park Avenue.

52:35.027 --> 52:37.237
A man approached my patrol
car and stated

52:37.321 --> 52:41.324
that he thought he had seen suspicious
men in the adjacent alley.

52:41.408 --> 52:46.037
The alley in question was just
to the west of my location.

52:46.121 --> 52:49.958
At this time, I observed an
unknown suspect with a gun

52:50.042 --> 52:53.294
chasing another man who
appeared to be unarmed.

52:53.379 --> 52:57.382
I identified myself verbally and began
chasing the man with the gun.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.325
Get on past me.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.590
Who tipped you to the game?

53:40.467 --> 53:43.052
You know I can't
give you that, Dave.

53:43.137 --> 53:47.557
You got a tip. I improvised.
There's a man dead.

53:47.641 --> 53:49.058
How do you feel about that?

53:49.143 --> 53:51.978
The streets smell cleaner already.

53:52.062 --> 53:56.357
L.A.P.D. Is back in town, and
it's called Dave Brown.

53:56.442 --> 53:58.902
Where's your gratitude?

54:15.377 --> 54:17.045
Glad I could help.

54:17.129 --> 54:19.255
I need to know.

54:19.340 --> 54:21.883
Forget it, I can't. I don't play
games, I don't name names.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.763
Shh yourself, goddammit!

54:30.309 --> 54:33.603
That's the way I handle
it. You understand?

54:33.687 --> 54:36.105
Yeah. It's a good motto.

54:37.775 --> 54:41.861
What are the odds they go and I go

54:41.946 --> 54:45.740
the same night to take
that game down?

54:45.824 --> 54:47.325
What are the odds?

54:47.409 --> 54:51.162
You handled it, Dave. Hurray.

54:52.623 --> 54:54.540
I could have got killed myself.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.042
You didn't.

54:59.254 --> 55:02.840
I don't know how much more
of this shit I can take.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.690
Jesus Christ!

55:18.774 --> 55:20.566
Where were you? I left
you six messages.

55:20.651 --> 55:24.779
I'm not your fucking girlfriend.
My battery died.

55:24.863 --> 55:26.656
I nearly got killed the other night

55:26.740 --> 55:29.867
while you were out looking
for a bone to chew on.

55:29.952 --> 55:31.786
Where the hell were you?

55:41.255 --> 55:42.672
Fuck you.

55:47.886 --> 55:50.805
You're insane, Dave. You're insane.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.516
Well, guess what, Linda? It
takes one to know one.

55:56.854 --> 56:00.273
I want the truth.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.400
You came after me that night.

56:02.484 --> 56:05.653
Of course I fucking did. You're
the man of my dreams, right?

56:05.738 --> 56:07.947
Who the hell are you working for?

56:08.032 --> 56:09.824
You watch too much television.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.659
I told you I'm on your side!

56:11.744 --> 56:13.578
I'm not working for
anyone or anybody.

56:13.662 --> 56:15.413
- You're paranoid.
- You're breaking my heart.

56:15.497 --> 56:17.915
Yeah? You broke into
my fucking house.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.835
I located your security flaw.

56:20.919 --> 56:23.463
- Fuck you.
- Your pool gate was open.

56:25.299 --> 56:26.674
Should I leave?

56:26.759 --> 56:29.552
Yeah.

56:42.232 --> 56:43.816
I'm sorry.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.109
I'm a mess.

56:53.744 --> 56:56.037
Will you sleep with me?

56:56.121 --> 56:58.164
Just tonight?

57:07.966 --> 57:11.427
No. You drink too much.

57:11.512 --> 57:13.054
Really?

57:16.058 --> 57:21.813
You're great in the sack, Linda,
but you lie to be liked.

57:21.897 --> 57:24.398
Is that right?

57:24.483 --> 57:25.817
That's right.

57:25.901 --> 57:27.568
Yeah, well, guess what?

57:27.653 --> 57:30.196
It takes one to know one.

57:40.457 --> 57:42.083
You're a bitch. You know that?

57:42.167 --> 57:42.792
Yeah.

58:06.984 --> 58:11.320
General?

58:13.824 --> 58:16.576
General!

58:16.660 --> 58:17.994
Get over here, now!

58:31.884 --> 58:33.634
How are you doing?

58:33.719 --> 58:34.802
Doing okay. How're you?

58:36.930 --> 58:40.099
I'm good.

58:41.268 --> 58:43.352
How are you?

58:45.606 --> 58:47.690
- Didn't we just go through this?
- Yeah.

58:51.820 --> 58:53.988
Hey... look at me.

58:54.072 --> 58:57.033
Look me right in the eye.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.747
Did you see anything
unusual lately?

59:02.831 --> 59:04.290
No.

59:04.374 --> 59:05.708
Anything around the Crystal Market?

59:05.792 --> 59:06.876
I said no. I didn't see shit.

59:08.295 --> 59:09.503
- You sure?
- Yeah.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.382
- You positive?
- Not a damn thing.

59:20.474 --> 59:22.099
Fancy.

59:24.853 --> 59:26.562
Go ahead, take two.

59:28.607 --> 59:30.524
What the hell happened
to your head?

59:39.284 --> 59:40.910
Watch that beard.

59:42.788 --> 59:45.790
Don't want to see you
go up in smoke.

59:49.586 --> 59:52.672
Two dickhead cops

59:52.756 --> 59:54.924
broke flashlights on me.

59:55.008 --> 59:56.676
Ow!

59:56.760 --> 59:58.094
Fuck! Don't do that!

59:58.178 --> 59:59.637
Just keeping the streets safe.

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.353
I'm not hurting anybody.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.523
If I sell a little, smoke a little,

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.233
it's no big deal to nobody.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:14.944
I'm nobody. I'm nothing.
I'm nobody. Nobody.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.159
They got fucking niggers
slinging golf balls

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:23.995
up and down these streets.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:29.333
All talk, cavi, cavi, cavi, cavi.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.627
Want to crack my head open.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.589
Asshole cops.

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:39.468
Give me a sip.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.435
Give me a sip.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:00:59.905
Here.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:04.952
Call this lawyer, sue the L.A.P.D.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.455
Linda.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:11.500
Is she hot? Linda... Fentress?

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:13.169
And blonde all over.

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:14.837
Fuck, yeah.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.672
Why, your thing still working?

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:22.261
No. Not really.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.722
But a starving man eats
the best pussy.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.894
Are we brothers?

01:01:32.064 --> 01:01:34.940
You're my brother.

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.155
Keep it...

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.074
brother.

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.461
- Hey, man.
- Can I help you?

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:59.006
Let me get a number six.

01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:00.716
A number six.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.601
Okay. It'll be five minutes.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.915
You fucking with me?

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.291
What?

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:39.713
I'm listening. What are you, I. A?

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:42.049
Man, I'm just sitting here
trying to get my shrimp.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:44.760
Is that what you're gonna
say next time I spot you?

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.516
Here we go. Here we go.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.560
Kyle Timkins, D.A. Investigator.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:55.521
You say both robbers escaped?

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.898
That's kind of hard to believe.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:02.903
Also, there's a big gap between
the time the neighbors

01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:05.990
say they heard the shots and
you reported the incident.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:09.535
Also, it's kind of strange

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.871
that you would be in that location
without your radio.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:17.877
Why isn't the Robbery Unit on this when
both robbers did indeed escape?

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:21.255
- Your recent misconduct...
- Perceived misconduct.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:26.969
Perceived misconduct brings into
question your mental state

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:28.220
on the night of the incident.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.930
That's why I'm here.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.433
Listen, uh, Jack...

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.852
No, I'm Kyle.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:37.438
Listen, Jack...

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:41.692
you got this assignment because
I'm controversial

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.737
and your ancestors were
stolen from Africa.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.520
You got this assignment to
cover the Department on

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.159
perceived racial bias

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:54.455
pertaining to Shondell J. Parmallee
and other shit-faced scum.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:57.333
You're mad as hell, and
you want me to know it.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.585
But while you're playing gumshoe,

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:02.671
bear in mind that I
am not a racist.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:06.926
Fact is, I hate all people equally.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:11.555
And if it helps, I've slept
with some of your people.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.682
You want to be mad at someone,

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.352
try J. Edgar Hoover.
He was a racist.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:19.188
Or the Founding Fathers,
all slave-owners.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:22.733
Me, I'm just doing my job.

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:28.113
All that may be true, but we're
not here talking about me.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.448
We're here talking about you. Okay?

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.080
Officer Hoover?

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:39.750
I've got another question.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:43.212
Why are you still with
the Department?

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.339
After all the shit that's going on,

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:50.594
the scandal, the Mayor, the
D.A., the Chief of Police,

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:52.763
why do they still have you around?

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:58.519
Must be because I'm innocent.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.274
Nice to meet you, Kyle.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.076
You all have seen how every
wannabe gangbanger

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.620
walking down the street being
pulled down by their dogs.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:18.706
Hey, Boss! Boss! Get him!

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.669
Get him, Boss! Boss, what did
I say? Sit tight. Hey, Boss!

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:26.171
Dave.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.217
Stay up late last night?

01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:33.178
Of course.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.224
How you feeling?

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:39.351
Good, good, good.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:43.022
Just waiting for the pits
to eat a protestor.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:46.692
You know you're being watched?

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.986
What do you mean?

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.238
Good boy! There he goes.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:53.073
There he goes.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.423
I'm glad you found me.

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:12.676
It wasn't hard. I just wanted
to see for myself.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.847
Mom says you're deeper in the shit.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.141
Those are my words, not hers.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.435
Well...

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:24.229
people keep telling me that.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.899
Well, maybe it's true, then.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.108
Yeah, I am.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.735
You took a cab, right?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.195
Tell me you didn't take a bus

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.197
out here to the goddamn jungle.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.908
It's the Barrio, Dad. It's
not the fucking jungle.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.840
- And yes, I took a bus.
- I told you, babe,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.702
I don't want you...

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:40.371
Don't call me "babe."

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:41.955
I don't want you straying
east of La Brea...

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.499
It's disgusting.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:49.588
How is... How's school?

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.803
It sucks.

01:06:57.889 --> 01:07:00.140
It's full of...

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:04.019
"candy-assed future fags
and dykes, like me."

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.941
Those are your words, not mine.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.984
I never said that.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:16.949
How's it going at home?

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:24.415
Margaret's onto you. She's angry.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:27.626
Guess that's something every Dave
Brown daughter has to go through.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:34.383
You're a dinosaur, Date-rape.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:40.389
You're a classic racist,
a bigot, a sexist.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:46.687
A womanizer, a chauvinist,
a misanthrope,

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.315
homophobic clearly, or maybe
you don't like yourself.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.989
How long did it take you
to rehearse that?

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:30.104
Well, say something.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.689
Don't touch me, say something!

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.154
Why don't I drive you home?

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:41.867
No, I don't want to go home.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.618
They're having an open house.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.997
I don't want to be there.
I want to be at Jo's.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.832
Joe/Joseph or Jo/Josephine?

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.542
I'll just take the bus!

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.046
Helen... I'm kidding!

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:12.231
Yeah.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.983
<i>Your phone is
tapped. Don't say a word.</i>

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:18.862
<i>Jesus, the shit I have to take
care of because of you.</i>

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:20.781
<i>You're just like your father, Dave.</i>

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.616
<i>You think you're smarter
than you are.</i>

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.412
Every shooting testimony contains
inconsistencies.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.122
Otherwise, you wouldn't have a job.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.834
No man who ever shoots
and kills another man

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.502
is entirely cogent in the moment.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:37.130
No plan survives contact
with the enemy.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.300
Did you learn that with the
first man you killed?

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.261
I learned that serving my country

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.263
as a non-electric pop-up target

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:48.350
in an often misunderstood crusade
for liberty and justice

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.103
turned puppet show for politicians.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.437
Called Vietnam.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:53.897
Known as the Vietnam war.

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:55.399
Can we not go to Vietnam today?

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.025
Let's fast-forward to the present.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.403
Why are you looking
to hang me? Why me?

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.489
I know you're setting me up.
Blago's got it in for me.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:06.493
Answer my question. Of all the
truly rotten cops out there

01:10:06.578 --> 01:10:08.579
why are you after the
one guy who gets it?

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:11.081
"The one cop who gets it"?

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.792
- Are you in on this?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.378
Let me remind you that
several years ago

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:21.425
you killed an alleged serial
date-rapist premeditatively.

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:24.094
Did you know that he had a wife
and three small children?

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:27.014
She had a nervous breakdown
after his death,

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.892
and ended up in an insane asylum,
where she spent nine years

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.394
until she cut her wrists with
a disposable razor blade.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:35.606
The kids were raised, by the
way, in foster homes.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:38.840
Two of them alleged that they
were sexually abused by

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.152
their foster fathers.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.112
So please don't come
in here whining.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.907
You've got a lot of nerve.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:53.540
Up this time. And something
to make it hard.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.602
Watch it, man.

01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:47.190
I mean, I feel like...

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.907
Dave, what are you doing here?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:03.790
Listen, my lawyers are burning
through my money

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:07.419
and we're gonna have to
tighten our belts.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.255
We're gonna have a trial
date soon, so...

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.549
what are you even doing here, Dave?

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:15.218
I came to talk to you about this.

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:16.887
You don't live here any more.

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.847
You can't walk in like
you still live here.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.765
Oh, for God's sakes.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.185
You know what I think?

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.020
I think you were a dirty
cop from day one.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.605
Okay.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.232
You were a dirty cop
with a dirty mind

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:32.444
and you dirtied all of
us up by default.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.946
I think you think you can
just ride this out,

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.949
thinking you can go back
to your fucking.

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:41.080
- You've got to go.
- Tough guy, law and

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.329
order bullshit.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:44.873
It's over, Dave. It's over.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.541
You know what happened to you?

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.668
- Just let him go.
- First the bar. And then

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:50.503
- the women and the booze.
- Cathy.

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:55.050
- You're a selfish man, Dave!
- Come on.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:56.801
It's not worth it. Just let him go.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.929
You were a bad husband.
You're a bad father.

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.722
- You're a bad lay.
- Why are you doing this?

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.515
Just let him go.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.559
This "man keeping family
together" bullshit?

01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:08.563
It's fucked the girls
up forever. Forever.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:11.191
Helen is out here. Can you stop?

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:14.736
You don't know one thing
about your girls.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.655
You are a fraud, Dave.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.240
That's enough.

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:21.326
- You're a fraud.
- You've got to go.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.286
Okay.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.251
It's okay.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.545
Bye.

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:49.813
Come on. Everything's
okay. Let's go inside.

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.108
I'm sorry, honey.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.632
Damn it.

01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.220
I'm thirsty.

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.055
I'll bet you are.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.057
Come on, just give me a pull.
Just give me a pull.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.809
Get your fucking hand
out of the car.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:32.480
Come on. You're my brother.
Just a sip. A sip.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.775
Give me a smoke.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.195
Give me a smoke. I want a cigarette.
Give me a cigarette.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.364
No.

01:17:41.449 --> 01:17:42.657
Yeah. Come on, give me a drink.

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:43.575
Sober up.

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:51.708
Linda's a good woman. She's taken
really good care of me.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.877
We're gonna take all your
asshole friends down.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.090
Can you spot me a fiver?
I don't feel so hot.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.009
Sell your wheelchair.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:04.721
Fuck you, white skin. I got robbed.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.605
I need a blanket.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.070
Five bucks, please.
Just five bucks.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:22.697
Do I look like Santa Claus to you?

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:24.949
No, you don't look like Santa
Claus. You're my brother.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.242
Us vets got to stick
together, don't we?

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.036
I'm not your brother.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.996
- I don't have a family.
- Yes you are. Yes you do.

01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:32.415
I'll pay you back.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.959
I'll pay you back when Linda
and I make a killing.

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:37.587
- Stop saying her name.
- Linda.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.464
You stop saying her name, okay?

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.007
You say her name one more time,

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:42.967
I'll hurt you.

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.053
You don't get it. We're
gonna be rich as shit.

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:51.142
I'm gonna go around the world,

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:52.644
around the world.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.896
Around the world. Around the world.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.816
I'm gonna tell my story and they're
gonna fucking pay me.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.818
I'm gonna be on talk shows.
I'm gonna have a suit.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:02.487
- What did you tell her?
- I told her everything.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:03.880
- Tell me exactly what
you told her.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.739
- I told her my plan...

01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:07.992
about we're gonna get a
big house together...

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.286
somewhere in Northern California

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:12.539
on a lot of property where
anybody can come

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.416
who needs a place, has a place

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.084
where you can shower,
you can hang out,

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:17.585
or you can get your head right.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.003
All my friends are gonna be there,

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.338
so you should definitely come.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:21.756
And Linda will make us eggs.

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:23.466
What about the Crystal Market?

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:26.511
- I told her everything.
- Everything?

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.929
Everything.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:30.849
Come on, give me a drink.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:35.145
Get the fuck out of here!

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.299
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:09.179
Why, are you afraid of something?

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:11.639
Will you come inside? Come
on. It's raining.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:15.351
Yeah, I can see that. I'm already
in. What does it matter?

01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:19.147
What are you doing?

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.190
General told you.

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:23.610
Who?

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:27.906
He saw me shoot that man in the Crystal
Market and drop a piece on him.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.824
Baby, I don't want to hear this.

01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:31.534
It's raining. Come inside.

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:33.870
He got roughed up by the
L.A.P.D. That's all.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.247
You gonna believe him over me?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.416
- What?
- Get in the pool.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.293
I'm not getting in the
fucking pool. No.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:43.254
If you're on my side, get
in the fucking pool.

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.131
No. You're crazy. I'm going in.

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:46.716
Get in the fucking pool.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.635
I'm going in. You make
the next move.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.429
- Get in the pool.
- Don't fucking touch me. Get off.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:53.932
Don't go inside. Get in this pool.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:57.560
No.

01:20:57.645 --> 01:20:59.562
- Come here.
- No.

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:01.356
- Don't.
- Get in this pool.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.565
No.

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:03.608
You bitch.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.360
Come in.

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:11.699
You think you can take me down?

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:14.702
I don't need you! I
don't need anyone!

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.375
I'm just a fucking cop!

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:24.546
I'm a fucking soldier!
I'm dispensable!

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.090
There're a lot of other
cocks to suck!

01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:31.386
You're heartless,
Linda! You played me!

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:35.098
I hate you! I fucking hate you!!

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:39.978
Are you even
listening, you bitch?!

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.063
Get in this fucking pool!

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.153
Discrepancies and inconsistencies.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.613
Ah, Jesus.

01:21:50.698 --> 01:21:52.782
Dave, I've got six card players,

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:56.953
all of them claiming that
it was a no weapons game.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:58.997
Four of them heard the shots.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:02.250
All of them claim it was
two sets of three pops,

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:03.960
all at the same clip,

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:08.256
which indicates you fired
your weapon first.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.010
Right? Now, I traced
the gun right back

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.387
to this station right here.

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:17.015
Ballistics show that
the gun was involved

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:19.684
in another officer shooting.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.436
Alright?

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.521
So I'm sweating the cop
that sold you the gun,

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:26.983
because not only can I prove
that his shooting was dirty,

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:28.693
I can prove that your
shooting was dirty,

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:31.904
just like I can prove you're dirty.

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:35.366
I got two eyewitnesses
that saw your ass

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:37.035
outside of that Crystal Market

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.037
right before it jumped off.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:41.122
So go home and pack a bag.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:43.124
Make sure there's a
wetsuit in there

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.585
because I'm sending your
ass up the river.

01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:48.713
Come on, baby.

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.465
I've been up river, motherfucker,

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.675
when you were still sucking
on your mama's tit.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.554
My mother died when I was born,
you racist son-of-a-bitch.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:05.021
You save that Grand wizard
shit for the jury.

01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:50.525
I need you to help me put
a leash on Kyle Timkins.

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.735
Help you?

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.612
That's all I do is help.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:58.658
I am not the help.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:00.952
Crystal Market.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:03.705
Again with the market.

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:06.791
No, still with the market.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:11.045
You're covering for someone
who's trying to bury me.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:15.091
I'm not sure I understand
the rules, okay?

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:17.885
The rules change.

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:21.139
The laws change. The people change.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:24.225
They accommodate. They adapt.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.685
But not you.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:28.354
Why is that?

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:31.441
Explain to me exactly what happened
at the Crystal Market.

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:33.860
I've got to get away from you.

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:40.032
I've got a business to
protect, contacts.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:43.077
I don't know you. I don't know...

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:49.041
Put that away.

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.377
Why me, Hart? Why me?

01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:56.340
Stop whining. Why you?
Why me? Why anybody?

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.633
You set me up.

01:24:57.718 --> 01:25:00.303
You set yourself up, Dave.

01:25:01.889 --> 01:25:06.309
Give me the gun.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:03.449
Call an ambulance.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:01.048
Hey.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:03.885
Come in.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:05.553
What was that noise?

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:07.471
Oh, the lock.

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:12.476
Come on. Come in. Get out
of the hallway. Please.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:13.811
Come on.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:21.027
Hey, what a surprise.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:22.653
Do you want to give it to him?

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:24.906
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I'm fine.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:37.752
These are for you.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:40.087
Thank you.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:42.590
- How are you?
- Good.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:43.966
Yeah?

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:58.356
So tell me... what have
you been up to?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.569
Nothing. We just came by
to drop off the clothes.

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:05.821
Oh. Okay.

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:11.535
You found me.

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:14.622
How did you do that?

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:22.129
There was a caller I.D.

01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:23.839
What?

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:26.300
Caller I.D. You called
the house from here.

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:32.431
That's good police work.

01:28:32.516 --> 01:28:34.809
Yeah, it was really hard.

01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:38.729
So...

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:39.814
here you are.

01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:45.653
Come on in. Don't be afraid.
You want to sit?

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:46.904
No.

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:48.364
Can I get you a soda?

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.825
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah?

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:53.327
Okay.

01:28:53.412 --> 01:28:54.704
You don't want anything?

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:56.414
No, I'm good.

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:07.591
You look beautiful, both of you.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.061
Your face looks red.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.733
Too much sun.

01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:26.027
It means he's been drinking.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.906
Haven't you?

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:32.283
What?

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.869
You've been drinking.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:38.956
I was just...
Yeah, a little bit.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:42.168
A little bit.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:45.838
Okay. Wow.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:51.802
- Do you wanna go?
- Yeah.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.096
I don't know.

01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:56.265
We're gonna go.

01:29:56.349 --> 01:29:58.976
You want to talk a little bit?

01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:00.728
No, that's fine.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:03.230
Hey. Hey.

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:05.232
I know why you came.

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:07.651
To drop off the clothes.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.320
Let's go. Come on.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.781
You want to know if it's true.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:16.994
Every bad thing you've
heard about me?

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:24.043
You want me to give you some
way out so it doesn't

01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:26.670
hurt so much.

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:35.763
There's no way out.

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:38.641
Every single thing you heard

01:30:38.725 --> 01:30:43.104
and more, it's all true.

01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:50.528
I can never... change.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:08.462
But I want you to know

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:17.221
I never hurt any good people.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:23.686
What about us?

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:28.566
No, that's not what I mean, Helen.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:31.527
I don't understand
what you do mean.

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:35.489
Have I hurt you?

01:31:38.368 --> 01:31:40.536
I didn't mean to.

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:44.665
We have to go, okay?

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:46.250
Hey.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.670
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Hey. Come on.

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:54.967
Hey! Hey, come here!

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.598
- Come back to the room.
- What are you doing?

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:04.435
I love you, monkey. You
know that, right?

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:05.853
I'm not letting you do this.

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:08.397
I'm gonna get you a soda, okay?

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:10.274
- I'll get you a soda.
- No.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:13.277
Will you come back? Monkey,
come back to the room.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:28.495
What's on your mind, Hoover?

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:36.628
This is Officer David D. Brown

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:39.715
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:41.467
This statement is made
of my own free will.

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:45.137
During my twenty-four
year police career

01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:48.807
I employed brutal and coercive
methods at whim.

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:54.646
And... created racial animus

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:57.149
with reckless disregard for the law

01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:59.693
that I was sworn to uphold
as a police officer.

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:04.406
On April 15th, 1987,

01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:09.661
I murdered a business acquaintance
of mine, Karl Joseph Huneck

01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:13.720
and rationalized the act
as a morally sound expression

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.084
of street justice

01:35:15.168 --> 01:35:18.295
against a man who I knew to
be a serial date-rapist.

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:23.092
I was legally sane at the
time I committed the act.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:29.306
Over the years, I've killed many
men. Bad guys, all of them.

01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:31.517
And if there are one
or two exceptions

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:34.353
I can only assume they ended up
on the wrong end of my gun

01:35:34.437 --> 01:35:37.147
to satisfy some karmic breech.

01:35:37.232 --> 01:35:40.442
This statement is proffered
lucidly.

01:35:40.527 --> 01:35:42.903
I am not in a state of duress.

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:44.780
Okay.

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:52.496
I'll give you this tape
if you cut me a deal.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.957
I don't want your tape.

01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:57.668
What?

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:01.422
That's not the confession I want.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:04.508
You want that fucking Crystal Market
case. You're a fucking idiot.

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:10.264
Next time I see you, I'm
putting cuffs on you.

01:36:11.891 --> 01:36:14.143
Are you out of your mind?

01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:18.021
Timkins! Take what you've got,
which is a good case.

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:19.731
It's the wrong confession.

01:36:19.816 --> 01:36:24.653
Take the fucking tape.
You fucking idiot.

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:29.324
Take this fucking tape!

01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:34.204
You're a fucking idiot, Timkins!

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:40.252
Fucking idiot.

01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:07.738
But this one has
something in her ear.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:10.407
Oh!

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:11.658
Watch.

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:15.537
- Where did it go?
- You get to keep it.

01:37:15.622 --> 01:37:20.167
Where will it say? Oh, 1882.

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:23.587
1882? That's
pretty valuable.

01:37:25.507 --> 01:37:28.509
Really? That's so sweet of
you. Oh, my goodness.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:29.843
Where you going?

01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:30.928
Smoke.

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:32.846
- What?
- Smoke.

01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:33.680
What did she say?

01:37:34.305 --> 01:37:40.374
