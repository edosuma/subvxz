WEBVTT

00:01.603 --> 00:03.536
That's not right.

00:03.538 --> 00:05.271
That's so unreasonable.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.240
Yeah, well, if you're going
to be like this,

00:07.242 --> 00:09.442
then I don't want to talk
to you right now, either.

00:09.444 --> 00:12.245
Okay. I love you. Bye.

00:12.247 --> 00:15.014
Amazon customer support?

00:15.016 --> 00:17.283
No, my mother.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.286
Guess who she's insisting
we invite to our wedding.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.988
Jesus?

00:21.990 --> 00:23.923
If only.

00:23.925 --> 00:25.925
My brother.

00:25.927 --> 00:28.061
Wait a minute.
You didn't invite your brother

00:28.063 --> 00:29.529
to your own wedding?

00:29.531 --> 00:31.965
He tormented me
my whole childhood.

00:31.967 --> 00:33.066
I don't think
I should reward

00:33.068 --> 00:34.400
that type of behavior

00:34.402 --> 00:35.902
with a slice of wedding cake
in the shape

00:35.904 --> 00:37.670
of the Millennium Falcon.

00:37.672 --> 00:39.706
Try again.

00:39.708 --> 00:42.542
A slice of wedding cake
in the shape of a cake.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.679
Look, he may have been mean
to you when you were kids,

00:46.681 --> 00:48.815
but you're both grown men now.

00:48.817 --> 00:50.717
That's right.
I'm a grown-up,

00:50.719 --> 00:53.253
and if I don't want to invite
him to my wedding, then I won't.

00:53.255 --> 00:54.888
Okay.

00:54.890 --> 00:55.877
Except I have to 'cause
my mommy's making me.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.938
Okay, so each welcome bag
gets a schedule of events,

01:26.014 --> 01:28.080
a map, and
chocolate from me.

01:28.082 --> 01:31.417
And from Sheldon,
a bottle of Purell...

01:32.520 --> 01:34.921
...the number for Poison
Control in case someone

01:34.923 --> 01:36.389
accidentally drinks the Purell,

01:36.391 --> 01:38.424
and a laminated

01:38.426 --> 01:41.027
table of elements because
the American school system

01:41.029 --> 01:43.129
is a failure.

01:43.131 --> 01:45.832
How many out-of-town guests
are there gonna be?

01:45.834 --> 01:47.099
I'm actually not sure.

01:47.101 --> 01:49.035
Turns out Sheldon
didn't invite his brother.

01:49.037 --> 01:52.004
Mm. Now it's starting
to sound like a wedding.

01:52.006 --> 01:54.841
And his mom said she won't come
if his brother's not there.

01:54.843 --> 01:57.477
Ooh, now it's starting to sound
like a good wedding.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.112
WOLOWITZ:
Hey, Bernie. Hey.

02:00.114 --> 02:03.049
How do you know
if someone has pink eye?

02:03.051 --> 02:06.486
Um, their eye would be red,
swollen and probably oozy.

02:06.488 --> 02:08.420
Okay, thanks.

02:08.423 --> 02:10.223
Both kids have pink eye.

02:10.225 --> 02:11.324
Oh, no.

02:11.326 --> 02:12.792
You stop right there.

02:12.794 --> 02:14.360
I'm getting married in a week;

02:14.362 --> 02:16.062
you are not giving me pink eye.

02:16.064 --> 02:17.330
I don't have pink eye.

02:17.332 --> 02:19.599
Hey! Hey. Hey.

02:19.601 --> 02:21.267
Step away from the bride.

02:21.269 --> 02:24.403
(chuckles): Okay.
I'll go back upstairs.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.172
Get in the shower and then take
those clothes and burn them.

02:26.174 --> 02:28.674
Yeah, and all the rest
of your clothes!

02:29.711 --> 02:32.011
Ah, worth a shot.

02:34.549 --> 02:38.417
So am I gonna be, like, the only
single guy at Sheldon's wedding?

02:38.419 --> 02:39.719
No.

02:39.721 --> 02:41.254
There-There'll be a lot
of single people there.

02:41.256 --> 02:44.357
Stuart, Amy's great-aunt...

02:44.359 --> 02:46.926
Although, Stuart's already
friended her on Facebook,

02:46.928 --> 02:49.495
so, better move quick.

02:49.497 --> 02:51.297
I got to find a date.

02:51.299 --> 02:53.132
I don't want to be
that sad single friend

02:53.134 --> 02:54.634
that everyone looks at
with pity.

02:54.636 --> 02:58.504
Uh, I'm-I'm afraid
that ship may have sailed.

03:00.074 --> 03:01.340
Leonard,

03:01.342 --> 03:03.142
you have a brother,
right?

03:03.144 --> 03:04.210
Yes.

03:04.212 --> 03:05.278
Is he the worst?

03:05.280 --> 03:07.079
Is he an unspeakable
abomination?

03:07.081 --> 03:09.882
Does the very thought of him
make your skin crawl?

03:09.884 --> 03:12.218
Well, he laughs
at his own jokes,

03:12.220 --> 03:13.953
but otherwise he's okay.

03:13.955 --> 03:15.655
Sheldon, what's going on?

03:15.657 --> 03:18.457
I'm trying to invite
my stupid brother to my wedding

03:18.459 --> 03:19.959
and he's avoiding my calls.

03:19.961 --> 03:22.161
You don't know he's
avoiding your calls.

03:24.432 --> 03:26.198
(line ringing)

03:26.200 --> 03:27.967
GEORGE JR.: Hey, you've reached
George Cooper.

03:27.969 --> 03:30.036
Please leave a message,
unless this is Sheldon again,

03:30.038 --> 03:32.471
in which case, please try me
on my other number,

03:32.473 --> 03:35.875
1-800-suck-it.

03:38.146 --> 03:39.211
See?

03:39.213 --> 03:41.013
And I know that's not
a real number

03:41.015 --> 03:43.015
because why would it be
toll-free?

03:44.085 --> 03:45.685
Sheldon, you tried.

03:45.687 --> 03:47.019
What more could you have done?

03:47.021 --> 03:48.854
Hey, why didn't you invite
him in the first place?

03:48.856 --> 03:51.357
You don't know what it was like
growing up with him.

03:51.359 --> 03:54.427
I get it; I grew up
with lots of brothers.

03:54.429 --> 03:56.395
My brother Adoot was
especially mean.

03:56.397 --> 03:58.164
Really? I've never
heard you mention Adoot.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.799
Yeah, sure I have.

03:59.801 --> 04:01.934
He's the one who left the door
open when we were kids,

04:01.936 --> 04:03.869
and my pet mongoose ran away.

04:04.772 --> 04:07.974
Stupid Adoot.

04:07.976 --> 04:10.776
Look, uh, short of getting
on a plane and flying there,

04:10.778 --> 04:12.778
what does your mother
expect you to do?

04:16.117 --> 04:17.416
I kept saying no.

04:17.418 --> 04:20.486
H-H-How am I here?

04:21.656 --> 04:22.788
Hey, did I tell you?

04:22.790 --> 04:24.056
- I found a date.
- To the wedding?

04:24.058 --> 04:25.491
Uh, to coffee.

04:25.493 --> 04:28.461
But if things go well,
Sheldon and Amy's wedding.

04:28.463 --> 04:30.529
Aren't you worried
it's a little intense

04:30.531 --> 04:33.065
to ask someone you just met
to go to a wedding?

04:33.067 --> 04:35.635
(sighs)
I'm running out of time.

04:35.637 --> 04:37.269
Wh-Wh-Why can't there be
a service where you can

04:37.271 --> 04:40.873
just pay someone to be
your date for the evening?

04:43.077 --> 04:44.543
Like an escort service?

04:44.545 --> 04:47.113
No, no, no. Y-You wouldn't
be paying for sex.

04:47.115 --> 04:48.481
I mean, obviously if
things went well,

04:48.483 --> 04:51.283
it could lead to sex,
but, but the money is for,

04:51.285 --> 04:53.352
like, you know, her time
and companionship.

04:53.354 --> 04:57.456
Oh, I get it...
an escort service.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.058
Stop saying that.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.459
Stop meaning it.

05:02.163 --> 05:04.130
WOLOWITZ: Hey, Raj, remember
when you borrowed

05:04.132 --> 05:05.965
my VR goggles the other day?

05:05.967 --> 05:07.500
Yeah.

05:07.502 --> 05:10.136
(sighs)
Probably shouldn't have done that.

05:15.910 --> 05:19.078
So, wait, y-your
brother is Dr. Tire?

05:19.080 --> 05:20.546
Yes, and, apparently,

05:20.548 --> 05:22.715
it only takes half a semester
of community college

05:22.717 --> 05:25.384
to get that
particular doctorate.

05:25.386 --> 05:27.953
We passed three
of these stores on the way here.

05:27.955 --> 05:31.524
Why did you say he's just
"some loser who sells tires"?

05:31.526 --> 05:33.192
You're right,
that was unfair.

05:33.194 --> 05:35.394
He's a loser who
sells more tires

05:35.396 --> 05:37.563
than anyone in Texas.

05:40.101 --> 05:42.101
Oh, excuse me.

05:42.103 --> 05:43.402
Uh, we're looking
for a Georgie Cooper.

05:43.404 --> 05:46.305
One second, I'll check to see
if the doctor's in.

05:47.141 --> 05:49.241
He is not
a doctor.

05:49.243 --> 05:53.212
(scoffs) There's only
one doctor here and it's me.

05:53.214 --> 05:54.714
I'm also a doctor.

05:54.716 --> 05:56.115
Do you want to wait
in the car?

05:56.117 --> 05:59.351
I wanted to wait
in California.

05:59.987 --> 06:03.189
So, is this Georgie?

06:03.191 --> 06:04.990
Yes.

06:04.992 --> 06:06.592
And what is
he even using

06:06.594 --> 06:08.794
that stethoscope
to listen to?

06:08.796 --> 06:11.163
I don't know, small leak?

06:11.165 --> 06:14.533
All right,
that makes sense.

06:16.003 --> 06:18.671
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:18.673 --> 06:19.572
Hello, Georgie.

06:19.574 --> 06:21.273
It's just George now.

06:21.275 --> 06:23.409
Fine, George.

06:23.411 --> 06:25.678
No, I don't like it-- Georgie.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.546
I see you haven't
changed one bit.

06:27.548 --> 06:30.082
Thank you, that is
a nice thing to say.

06:31.119 --> 06:32.184
Hey, I'm Leonard.

06:32.186 --> 06:35.087
I'm here for-for
no reason.

06:35.089 --> 06:37.656
What do you want, Sheldon?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.291
Why aren't you returning
my phone calls?

06:39.293 --> 06:40.760
You're supposed to
be the smart one;

06:40.762 --> 06:43.195
you figure it out.

06:43.197 --> 06:44.630
He's not <i>that</i> kind
of smart.

06:44.632 --> 06:46.465
You might want
to give him a hint.

06:47.502 --> 06:49.301
We haven't talked

06:49.303 --> 06:51.370
in over ten years, and now
that you need something,

06:51.372 --> 06:53.105
you think you can just
show up at my store?

06:53.107 --> 06:54.507
Well, let's just
drop everything

06:54.509 --> 06:56.208
to accommodate Sheldon.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.943
Nice try,

06:57.945 --> 07:00.179
but I am not a gullible
little boy anymore.

07:00.181 --> 07:03.115
I can recognize sarcasm.

07:03.117 --> 07:04.583
Okay. You're right.

07:04.585 --> 07:05.851
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

07:05.853 --> 07:07.052
Tell me what you need.

07:07.054 --> 07:08.921
Your wish is my command.

07:08.923 --> 07:10.389
That's better, thank you.

07:13.795 --> 07:15.961
(Skype ringing)

07:17.765 --> 07:19.298
Oh, my God.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.537
Yeah, I got it, too.

07:24.539 --> 07:27.773
Wow. You really can't keep
your hands off Howard, can you?

07:27.775 --> 07:30.709
I know, I have a problem.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.345
I just wanted to make sure
you and Amy didn't get it.

07:33.347 --> 07:35.781
(quietly):
Well, I didn't get it.

07:37.118 --> 07:40.152
You infected me a week
before my wedding.

07:41.489 --> 07:43.989
What am I supposed
to do about this?

07:43.991 --> 07:46.559
Wear a veil?

07:46.561 --> 07:48.594
(laughs)

07:48.596 --> 07:50.563
It's not funny.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.499
Look at what
you've done to me!

07:53.501 --> 07:55.100
Ah, hey.

07:55.102 --> 07:57.770
Could you just, like,
not touch my computer

07:57.772 --> 08:01.006
or... like, anything
else. I just, ugh,

08:01.008 --> 08:03.442
I don't want to look like that
in your wedding photos.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.379
There aren't gonna be
any wedding photos.

08:07.381 --> 08:09.281
My fiancé's a germophobe.

08:09.283 --> 08:10.549
If he finds out
I'm contagious,

08:10.551 --> 08:12.718
he'll never
come back from Texas.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.621
What if we tell him the theme
of the wedding is <i>Walking Dead</i>

08:15.623 --> 08:18.624
and this is our zombie makeup?

08:18.626 --> 08:19.925
That'll probably work.

08:19.927 --> 08:21.360
We'll call that plan B.

08:23.497 --> 08:26.398
Oh, well... (clears throat)

08:26.400 --> 08:28.901
Turns out this is gonna
come in handy after all.

08:31.873 --> 08:34.006
Hold up.
I-I'm confused.

08:34.008 --> 08:35.875
You didn't want me
at your wedding,

08:35.876 --> 08:37.376
but now
that Mom won't come,

08:37.378 --> 08:38.611
you want me there.

08:38.613 --> 08:40.913
I know you don't
hear this a lot,

08:40.914 --> 08:42.648
but that is exactly right.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.483
Good job.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.353
Not helping, Sheldon.

08:47.355 --> 08:49.121
Listen here,

08:49.123 --> 08:50.990
you want me at your wedding,

08:50.992 --> 08:52.858
all you got to do is ask nicely.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.994
(sighs)

08:54.996 --> 08:57.162
- Georgie.
- George.

08:57.164 --> 08:59.331
(groans)

09:00.234 --> 09:04.003
I would like you
at my wedding.

09:04.005 --> 09:05.838
Thank you, Sheldon.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.539
That is so nice to hear.

09:08.676 --> 09:11.110
But I would rather swallow
a pregnant wildcat

09:11.112 --> 09:14.313
and crap out
a litter of kittens.

09:16.017 --> 09:18.951
It is fitting that
you got into tires,

09:18.953 --> 09:21.253
because you are tiresome.

09:22.089 --> 09:24.290
Sheldon, come on.

09:25.359 --> 09:26.425
Was that too mean?

09:26.427 --> 09:29.261
No, not too mean,
not too good either.

09:32.899 --> 09:35.033
No, Mother.
That's not fair.

09:35.535 --> 09:37.301
But he told...

09:37.303 --> 09:39.403
Yes, ma'am.

09:39.405 --> 09:41.239
But I said...

09:41.241 --> 09:43.274
Yes, ma'am.

09:43.276 --> 09:45.209
Good-bye.

09:45.211 --> 09:47.145
What'd she say?

09:47.147 --> 09:49.247
She's not getting
in the middle of it because

09:49.249 --> 09:52.183
we "boys need
to work it out ourselves."

09:52.185 --> 09:53.885
Oh, maybe it's fine if

09:53.887 --> 09:55.453
she doesn't come to the wedding.

09:55.455 --> 09:56.854
I've got Amy now,

09:56.856 --> 10:00.424
and she can do everything
a mom can do and more.

10:00.426 --> 10:02.627
Say that to her
on the wedding night.

10:02.629 --> 10:04.729
Really spice things up.

10:04.731 --> 10:07.331
This is all Georgie's fault.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.901
My whole childhood,
he was mean to me.

10:09.903 --> 10:12.570
Sorry. I know what it's like
to live with a bully.

10:12.572 --> 10:14.906
Your brother bullied you?

10:14.908 --> 10:17.975
Oh, I was talking about Penny,
but sure, yeah.

10:17.977 --> 10:19.610
Once, when I was eight,

10:19.612 --> 10:21.245
I was going to dress
as my favorite scientist

10:21.247 --> 10:24.415
for Halloween, and
Georgie threw my costume away.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.516
I had to wear a sheet

10:25.518 --> 10:27.552
and go as a ghost.

10:27.554 --> 10:29.387
Scared myself all night long.

10:31.324 --> 10:33.724
Well, look, we don't fly
out until the morning.

10:33.726 --> 10:36.627
Why don't I try and talk to him,
give it one more shot?

10:36.629 --> 10:39.397
All right.

10:39.399 --> 10:41.332
But if he says,

10:41.334 --> 10:44.202
- "Nerd says what," don't answer him.
- What?

10:44.204 --> 10:46.037
You are a lamb to the slaughter.

10:49.242 --> 10:51.142
So, how was
your date?

10:54.347 --> 10:57.982
It was going well until my eye
dripped in her latte.

10:59.853 --> 11:02.353
We're so sorry
we ruined your date.

11:02.355 --> 11:04.388
Oh, boo-hoo.

11:05.558 --> 11:06.858
His date got ruined.

11:06.860 --> 11:09.760
I'm about to get married,
and look at me.

11:09.762 --> 11:11.762
It looks like it's
getting better.

11:11.764 --> 11:12.997
Oh, does it?

11:12.999 --> 11:16.601
Does it look like that
with your two clear eyes?

11:18.338 --> 11:20.705
I'm sorry. Are you mad
that I <i>don't</i> have pink eye?

11:20.707 --> 11:22.440
What do you think?
BOTH: Yes!

11:25.278 --> 11:27.278
Uh-huh. Okay.
(knocking)

11:27.280 --> 11:30.581
Okay. Uh, uh,
listen, I hear you.

11:30.583 --> 11:34.252
I know they're pricey,
but these are the Dallas Cowboys

11:34.254 --> 11:36.120
of tires, okay?

11:36.122 --> 11:37.688
And we're talking
the Troy Aikman Cowboys,

11:37.690 --> 11:39.891
not that pretty boy Tony Romo.

11:41.027 --> 11:42.593
All right. Good call.

11:42.595 --> 11:44.295
You won't regret it.

11:44.297 --> 11:46.597
Boom!
(laughs)

11:46.599 --> 11:48.199
Wow. That was impressive.
Yeah.

11:48.201 --> 11:50.301
Well, it's easy
when you love your product

11:50.303 --> 11:52.403
and hate Tony Romo.

11:52.405 --> 11:53.938
(laughs)

11:53.940 --> 11:55.706
Yeah, that guy's the...

11:55.708 --> 11:58.809
Actually, I don't,
I don't know who that guy is.

11:58.811 --> 12:02.280
If you are here about
Sheldon's wedding, don't bother.

12:02.282 --> 12:05.182
Come on. I-I know
you two have your differences.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.184
You mean pretty much everything
about us?

12:07.186 --> 12:09.086
Well, not everything.
(laughs)

12:09.088 --> 12:13.057
You're both tall, you
have the same last name.

12:13.059 --> 12:16.327
Maybe I shouldn't have
started this like it was a list.

12:16.329 --> 12:19.263
You have no idea
what you are talking about.

12:19.265 --> 12:22.300
Ooh, there--
that-that was very Sheldon.

12:24.070 --> 12:27.605
Look, I-I'm sure he was not
the easiest brother to have,

12:27.607 --> 12:29.040
but it wasn't easy
for him either,

12:29.042 --> 12:31.008
with you picking on him
all the time.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.610
(laughing)

12:32.612 --> 12:35.546
Picking on him?
Is that what he told you?

12:35.548 --> 12:37.148
Well, what about the time

12:37.150 --> 12:39.383
you threw away
his Halloween costume?

12:39.385 --> 12:43.654
Well, yeah, 'cause he was gonna
dress as some girl scientist.

12:44.824 --> 12:47.024
Madame Curie?

12:48.227 --> 12:50.661
Oh, I didn't know
she was a madam.

12:52.332 --> 12:55.366
Come on. He was still gonna get
beat up for wearing that dress.

12:55.368 --> 12:56.968
Well, didn't you sit on his head

12:56.970 --> 12:58.836
while he tried
to watch <i>Star Trek?</i>

12:58.838 --> 13:01.973
Well, yeah,
but that was hilarious.

13:01.975 --> 13:04.575
That is pretty hilarious, yeah.

13:04.577 --> 13:06.310
Look, I mean,

13:06.312 --> 13:08.446
I always looked out
for him at school.

13:08.448 --> 13:09.947
I drove him everywhere.

13:09.949 --> 13:12.249
I apologized to people
when he was rude.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.218
Yeah. I've
done all that.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.053
I've also removed all

13:16.055 --> 13:18.089
the red balloons
from his Lucky Charms

13:18.091 --> 13:20.591
because they weren't "Irish enough."
- All right.

13:20.593 --> 13:22.293
So you know
what I'm talking about.

13:22.295 --> 13:23.761
And has he ever thanked you?

13:23.763 --> 13:26.297
Not in so many words,

13:26.299 --> 13:28.666
or any words.

13:28.668 --> 13:31.302
Would it kill him
to actually say it?

13:32.171 --> 13:36.073
No. No, it wouldn't kill him.

13:37.276 --> 13:39.243
Leonard,

13:39.245 --> 13:42.246
you know how
I got the money

13:42.248 --> 13:45.116
to open up my
first store?

13:45.118 --> 13:47.151
I busted my ass for it,

13:47.153 --> 13:50.154
'cause all the extra money
that we had had to go to Sheldon

13:50.156 --> 13:52.223
so he could go to
college and he could go

13:52.225 --> 13:54.291
study in Germany.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.961
And do you know
what he's never said to me?

13:56.963 --> 13:59.964
<i>Danke schon?</i>

14:00.700 --> 14:03.234
It's, uh, "thank you" in German.

14:03.236 --> 14:06.070
Do you need me
to sit on your head?

14:06.072 --> 14:08.639
Nope.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.641
After all my sacrifices,

14:10.643 --> 14:13.911
guess which kid
my mom is the most proud of.

14:15.782 --> 14:17.748
If it makes you feel any better,

14:17.750 --> 14:20.951
my mom's most proud
of Sheldon, too, so...

14:21.721 --> 14:22.953
Leonard,

14:22.955 --> 14:24.488
you want a beer?

14:24.490 --> 14:26.524
Yeah, I would love a beer.

14:26.526 --> 14:28.292
There you go.

14:28.294 --> 14:30.661
Thanks. Can you open it for me?
No, it's a twist-off.

14:30.663 --> 14:32.630
I know.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.074

14:41.541 --> 14:43.474
Hey!

14:43.476 --> 14:46.777
I got all the beads
to the other side.

14:48.081 --> 14:50.114
It's not a puzzle, Penny.

14:50.116 --> 14:52.883
Do you really want
to be touching that?

14:52.885 --> 14:54.885
Do you know how
many sick kids...?

14:54.887 --> 14:57.688
You know, never mind.
Knock yourself out.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.090
(phone chimes)

14:59.092 --> 15:01.759
Bernadette says
they're checking the kids now.

15:01.761 --> 15:03.928
You know, maybe
we didn't <i>all</i> need to come.

15:03.930 --> 15:06.997
Hey, whatever kind of pink eye
their kids have, I have,

15:06.999 --> 15:08.666
and I need to know.

15:08.668 --> 15:11.102
And if it's viral, I'm screwed.

15:11.104 --> 15:14.338
Maybe not. You know, I know it's
not traditional wedding attire,

15:14.340 --> 15:16.907
but how about
a welder's mask?

15:16.909 --> 15:18.142
KOOTHRAPPALI:
If you know

15:18.144 --> 15:20.544
a welder, that could be
your "something borrowed."

15:21.914 --> 15:23.080
(door opens)

15:23.082 --> 15:24.915
Great news! It's bacterial!

15:24.917 --> 15:26.083
- Yeah! - Yeah.
- Yes!

15:26.085 --> 15:27.551
- Yeah. - Yes.
(whooping)

15:27.553 --> 15:29.153
What are you doing?!
Wash your hands!

15:29.155 --> 15:31.322
Oh.
Not you.

15:34.227 --> 15:36.093
Hello. Room service?

15:36.095 --> 15:39.497
I'm calling about
the club sandwich on your menu.

15:39.499 --> 15:41.866
No, I-I don't want one.

15:41.868 --> 15:44.201
I just want you
to spell it correctly.

15:45.605 --> 15:48.606
Unless the "club"
is the Poor Typing Club.

15:48.608 --> 15:50.307
Okay.

15:50.309 --> 15:55.746
Now let's discuss
this 15% "gratooty"?

15:56.816 --> 15:59.783
Yeah-- well, that was rude.

15:59.785 --> 16:02.553
Someone just lost
their gratooty.

16:02.555 --> 16:03.721
(sighs)

16:03.723 --> 16:07.224
Sheldon, you need
to apologize to your brother.

16:07.226 --> 16:09.226
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

16:09.228 --> 16:11.595
Like that, but nicer,
and that way.

16:11.597 --> 16:14.398
I have nothing
to apologize for.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.500
(scoffs)
I told you this was a bad idea.

16:16.502 --> 16:18.235
Sometimes you
can't patch a tire.

16:18.237 --> 16:20.337
You just got to
buy a new one.

16:20.339 --> 16:21.839
Actually, that's
always the case.

16:21.841 --> 16:24.475
Never patch, buy new.

16:24.477 --> 16:27.845
While I appreciate
your folksy tire wisdom,

16:27.847 --> 16:30.548
I don't appreciate what
you're putting Mom through.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.216
What would you know
about what Mom's been through?

16:32.218 --> 16:33.384
You were never home.

16:33.386 --> 16:34.485
Yeah, this is good.

16:34.487 --> 16:36.420
- Get it all out.
- Not now! - Shut up!

16:36.422 --> 16:39.156
You went away to
college after Dad died.

16:39.158 --> 16:40.858
Who do you think took
care of everything?

16:40.860 --> 16:44.695
Mom did. Mom <i>always</i>
took care of everything.

16:44.697 --> 16:47.331
Mom was a mess, Missy
was a dumb teenager.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.466
I had to look
after both of 'em.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.068
I talked to Mom
all the time.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.037
If she was upset,
she would have told me.

16:53.039 --> 16:55.706
She was protecting
you, you idiot,

16:55.708 --> 16:57.474
just like everyone
always does.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.510
If things were bad,

16:59.512 --> 17:00.578
then why didn't you tell me?

17:00.580 --> 17:03.113
Because <i>I</i> was
protecting you, too.

17:03.115 --> 17:04.815
(sighs)

17:06.285 --> 17:08.051
You're my baby brother, Sheldon.

17:08.054 --> 17:10.988
I know life has been
hard for you,

17:10.990 --> 17:14.925
but that don't mean it's been
easy for the rest of us.

17:16.929 --> 17:20.864
I suppose I didn't think about
how it was for everyone else.

17:20.866 --> 17:22.866
No, that's all right.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.569
I know you didn't.

17:26.472 --> 17:28.739
I'm sorry.

17:29.575 --> 17:31.742
Thank you.

17:31.744 --> 17:34.912
And it would
mean a lot to me

17:34.914 --> 17:37.514
to have my big brother
at my wedding.

17:41.153 --> 17:43.354
I wouldn't miss it.

17:49.328 --> 17:52.296
(voice breaking): Is it me,
or did we just patch a tire?

17:55.201 --> 17:58.502
He said, "Never patch."
Do you even listen?

18:03.738 --> 18:06.573
(Skype ringing)

18:06.575 --> 18:10.844
Hey, how's it going?

18:10.846 --> 18:12.479
Really good.

18:12.481 --> 18:14.781
Georgie's going to come
to the wedding.

18:14.783 --> 18:16.282
Oh, that's great!

18:16.284 --> 18:18.254
Why aren't you looking
at the camera?

18:18.255 --> 18:22.958
Oh, you know, I'm just working
on my peripheral vision.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.760
Well, that is nonsense.

18:24.762 --> 18:27.195
Your peripheral vision is fine.

18:27.197 --> 18:29.298
Are those women's magazines
making you feel bad

18:29.300 --> 18:31.300
about yourself again?

18:31.302 --> 18:35.971
Yup, that is what's happening.

18:35.973 --> 18:39.041
I have told you before,
those women are airbrushed

18:39.043 --> 18:42.644
to make it <i>look</i> like
they have good vision.

18:42.646 --> 18:45.013
Hey, I-I was thinking,

18:45.015 --> 18:47.249
now that you and your brother
made up,

18:47.251 --> 18:49.017
there's no reason to rush home.

18:49.019 --> 18:50.852
Maybe you and Leonard could,

18:50.854 --> 18:52.921
could stay for, uh...

18:52.923 --> 18:57.592
two to three more
fun-filled days there.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.529
That's a great idea!

19:00.531 --> 19:02.264
Hey, Leonard, good news.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.834
We <i>do</i> have time to visit the
Museum of the American Railroad!

19:06.837 --> 19:09.838
I'd say no,
but what's the point?

19:15.379 --> 19:17.879
Ooh. You might not want
to get too close.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.915
Pink eye.

19:19.917 --> 19:23.151
Me, too!

19:24.054 --> 19:25.687
- Bacterial?
- Yeah.

19:25.689 --> 19:28.290
Same!
(laughs)

19:28.292 --> 19:30.525
I-I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

19:30.527 --> 19:32.928
would you be interested in
going to a wedding with me?
