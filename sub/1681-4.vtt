WEBVTT

00:02.928 --> 00:05.306
Barney is crazy if he thinks
this is gonna work.

00:04.263 --> 00:05.222
I think it's
gonna work.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.432
I hope it doesn't work.

00:06.515 --> 00:07.975
Shh. Here he comes.

00:11.687 --> 00:14.398
You there, what's your name?
Excuse me?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.567
Your name, woman,
what's your name?!

00:16.650 --> 00:18.110
Cindy.
I knew it.

00:18.193 --> 00:20.154
You're the Cindy,

00:20.237 --> 00:22.448
the one who can change
everything,

00:22.531 --> 00:25.117
or spell our inevitable doom.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.328
Now listen to me, Cindy.

00:27.411 --> 00:28.746
I am Barney Stinson,

00:28.787 --> 00:32.040
and I am on an urgent mission
from the future.

00:32.082 --> 00:33.250
The future?

00:33.292 --> 00:35.669
The future, and I can
prove it to you.

00:35.711 --> 00:37.921
In exactly four seconds,
the woman at that booth

00:38.005 --> 00:39.715
is going to slap that man.
(clears throat)

00:41.967 --> 00:44.136
Ow! What the hell?

00:44.219 --> 00:45.929
Wow.
In a few minutes,

00:46.013 --> 00:48.599
the young me from your time

00:48.641 --> 00:50.934
is going to come
through that door.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.478
Now, Cindy,

00:52.519 --> 00:57.483
I know this sounds insane,
but in order to save the planet,

00:57.566 --> 01:00.319
you need to sleep with him
tonight.

01:00.402 --> 01:01.445
What? I...

01:01.528 --> 01:04.281
Sleep with Barney Stinson
tonight,

01:04.364 --> 01:05.949
in whatever way he wants it,

01:06.033 --> 01:10.120
or he won't be able to find
the solution to global warming

01:10.162 --> 01:11.955
that saves the human race.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.165
What are you talking about?

01:13.248 --> 01:15.250
I have no time to explain.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.670
I have to get back
to the reality accelerator

01:17.711 --> 01:20.839
before the vortex closes.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.133
Only you can save us, Cindy.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.344
I must away!

01:25.386 --> 01:28.222
Okay, guys, the movers
are coming in 14 hours.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.891
We gotta get back upstairs
and finish packing.

01:30.975 --> 01:32.977
You guys still
aren't finished packing?

01:33.018 --> 01:34.353
How is this taking so long?

01:34.436 --> 01:36.188
Hey, all the great memories
of our 20s

01:36.271 --> 01:37.481
took place in that apartment.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.525
It's not like throwing
stuff in a box.

01:39.608 --> 01:40.526
You start to reminisce.

01:40.609 --> 01:41.944
Not me. The key?

01:41.986 --> 01:43.445
Throw stuff out and never
look back.

01:43.487 --> 01:45.906
I'm moving to Japan.
It took me a half hour to pack.

01:45.948 --> 01:48.409
A half hour?
Well, it would have taken
me 20 minutes,

01:48.450 --> 01:49.868
but a friend called me in tears.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.663
Moving is really
emotional, okay?

01:52.746 --> 01:53.706
It is.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.332
I mean, everything is changing.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.376
I'm gonna be living
in New Jersey with Stella,

01:57.418 --> 01:59.211
you guys will be in
your new place.

01:59.294 --> 02:01.463
You're starting a new job
in Tokyo.

02:01.547 --> 02:03.632
It's the end of an era.

02:03.716 --> 02:06.093
I think we should have a toast,
but not our usual crap.

02:06.176 --> 02:09.054
Hey, uh, Wendy,
your most expensive
bottle of scotch.

02:09.138 --> 02:13.267
That's 50-year-old
Glen McKenna, and it's $2,500.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.644
Excellent. A bottle of that
with beer chasers,

02:15.686 --> 02:17.479
and what do you think,
cancel the scotch?

02:17.521 --> 02:19.440
ALL:
Yeah.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.318
Vodka rocks.

02:22.401 --> 02:24.111
It's not gonna work.

02:24.153 --> 02:27.448
Oh, my God, you're...
Oh, my God!

02:28.615 --> 02:29.616
Can I buy you a drink?

02:31.285 --> 02:33.829
I suppose I have time
for one drink

02:33.912 --> 02:37.583
and 45 minutes to an hour
of some other activity,

02:37.666 --> 02:39.460
but after that,
I have to get back

02:39.543 --> 02:42.254
to a top-secret research project
I'm working on.

02:42.338 --> 02:44.173
Global warming?

02:44.214 --> 02:47.801
My God, how did you know that?

02:47.802 --> 02:50.102

03:02.107 --> 03:03.525
Hey, look at this.

03:03.609 --> 03:06.195
A photo from the first day
we moved into this place.

03:06.278 --> 03:07.988
BOTH:
Aw...

03:08.072 --> 03:10.115
So many great memories.

03:10.199 --> 03:13.118
See? That is exactly the type
of crap you should be trashing.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.246
So you don't keep
any photos?

03:16.288 --> 03:19.291
No, they're like love letters
or yearbooks or someone's ashes.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.918
They just take up space.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.796
Besides, Stella's not gonna
let you keep half of this junk.

03:23.879 --> 03:24.797
Why wouldn't she?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.632
(both chuckle)

03:26.715 --> 03:28.801
Oh, Ted, oh, sweetie.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.427
Okay, here's the thing
that guys only learn

03:30.511 --> 03:32.304
after they move in
with a woman.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.390
All of your stuff is stupid.

03:34.473 --> 03:35.849
Like what?

03:35.891 --> 03:39.561
Um, like anything you bought
at a Renaissance Faire.

03:39.645 --> 03:42.147
Hey, hey, there's not enough
mead in the world

03:42.189 --> 03:43.983
to make me get rid
of my flail.

03:44.066 --> 03:45.651
Oh, hey, uh, Ted,

03:45.734 --> 03:47.695
since we're clearly not getting
our security deposit back,

03:47.778 --> 03:49.989
I thought maybe you could
reimburse me for my half.

03:50.072 --> 03:51.031
Wait a second--
why should I

03:51.115 --> 03:52.491
have to pay more than you?

03:52.574 --> 03:54.994
Because you treated this
apartment the way John Bonham

03:55.077 --> 03:56.996
treated his central nervous
system.

03:57.079 --> 03:58.664
That's not true.

03:58.747 --> 04:00.708
Exhibit A.

04:02.751 --> 04:03.919
Hey.
Hey.

04:03.961 --> 04:04.920
What's that?

04:05.004 --> 04:08.173
A 1986 World Book
encyclopaedia.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.009
It's exactly the one
I grew up with.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.510
Encyclopaedia?

04:11.552 --> 04:14.555
Oh, you think it should
be pronounced encyclo-pee-dia.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.016
It's a common mistake.

04:17.099 --> 04:18.726
But if you look at that squished
together "ae" symbol

04:18.809 --> 04:20.560
in this here encyclopaedia,

04:20.644 --> 04:22.855
you'll learn that
it's a ligature derived

04:22.938 --> 04:25.482
from the Anglo-Saxon
rune ash...

04:29.611 --> 04:33.824
You know, you're gonna have
to paedia for that.

04:35.159 --> 04:37.286
But you never did.

04:37.369 --> 04:39.455
And then there's Exhibit B.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.419
Good morrow, fair gentles.

04:45.461 --> 04:47.880
Look what I won
at the Renaissance Faire.

04:47.921 --> 04:52.092
Ooh!

04:52.176 --> 04:54.678
And you're also responsible
for any damage Robin did

04:54.720 --> 04:55.804
when she was your girlfriend.

04:55.846 --> 04:57.765
Whoa. What damage did I cause?

04:57.848 --> 04:59.975
Do you remember that night
when you drank

05:00.017 --> 05:02.311
the 12'er of Molson
and you got all super Canadian?

05:05.189 --> 05:07.733
(Canadian accent):
Stanley Cup, game six, eh?

05:07.816 --> 05:09.568
The Rangers are

05:09.610 --> 05:12.279
about to be sorry they ever
played shinny with the Canucks.

05:12.321 --> 05:13.614
Hey, hey, Robin.
Yeah?

05:13.656 --> 05:14.740
I'll give you 20 bucks if you

05:14.823 --> 05:16.408
can shoot it through
this front door.

05:16.450 --> 05:20.245
Oh, you're nuttier than
a Tim Horton's maple log.

05:20.329 --> 05:22.289
Timmy Ho!

05:22.373 --> 05:26.919
That's it, Robin.
Give me the stick.

05:27.002 --> 05:28.545
I'll give you summer teeth.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.714
Some are here, some are there.

05:30.756 --> 05:33.133
Robin, give me the stick,

05:33.217 --> 05:34.927
Take off, hoser.

05:35.010 --> 05:36.011
GUYS:
Whoa!

05:36.095 --> 05:37.012
That's it!

05:37.096 --> 05:38.013
Hey, hey!

05:38.097 --> 05:39.014
Get her, boys, get her!

05:39.098 --> 05:40.015
Scrap?! I'll scrap!

05:40.099 --> 05:41.642
Guys, come on!
For America.

05:41.684 --> 05:45.437
All right, break it,
break it up!

05:45.521 --> 05:47.523
Ted, no!

05:47.606 --> 05:50.025
You never break up a girl fight!

05:50.109 --> 05:53.487
Never! (groans)

05:54.488 --> 05:56.448
Entirely Barney's fault.

05:56.490 --> 06:01.745
As, by the way, is the big
scorch mark over the fireplace.

06:01.787 --> 06:04.915
<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, to understand
the story of the scorch mark,</i>

06:04.957 --> 06:07.459
<i>I first need to tell you
the story of the intervention</i>

06:07.543 --> 06:08.544
<i>for our friend Stewart.</i>

06:08.585 --> 06:09.545
What's going on?

06:09.628 --> 06:13.507
Stewart, this is
an intervention.

06:13.549 --> 06:16.760
The alcohol changes
you, Stewart.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.263
It makes you a
different person.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.391
And I'm in love with
the man that I married.

06:22.474 --> 06:24.810
Thank you.

06:24.893 --> 06:28.564
(voice breaking):
This is just the push I need.

06:28.647 --> 06:31.066
I love you guys.

06:31.150 --> 06:35.821
Hey, hey!
There's the birthday boy.

06:35.904 --> 06:38.657
Time to let the party monster
out of its cage, Stewie!

06:38.741 --> 06:39.992
No!

06:40.075 --> 06:41.493
Come on, buddy.

06:41.577 --> 06:43.996
People don't want to see
Bruce Banner, dude.

06:44.079 --> 06:45.581
They want to see the Hulk.

06:45.622 --> 06:49.043
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk... What?

06:49.126 --> 06:52.046
Oh...

06:52.129 --> 06:55.633
(chuckles)

06:55.716 --> 06:57.968
That's what I get for skimming
the E-vite.

06:59.386 --> 07:02.097
<i>TED:
Later that day, we celebrated</i>

07:02.181 --> 07:03.390
<i>our first successful
intervention.</i>

07:03.474 --> 07:06.435
I am really proud of us
for helping Stewart.

07:06.518 --> 07:09.396
Yeah, what an amazing
honest, human moment.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.523
I agree. Yay us.

07:11.607 --> 07:14.652
Marshall, are you really gonna
keep wearing that hat?

07:14.693 --> 07:16.236
Yeah, it's been two weeks,
Marshall.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.906
Two awesome weeks...

07:18.947 --> 07:22.618
and heck, yeah,
I'm gonna keep wearing it.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.041
Hey.

07:29.124 --> 07:31.418
Marshall,

07:31.460 --> 07:33.545
this is
an intervention.

07:34.838 --> 07:36.465
It's about the hat.

07:36.548 --> 07:39.218
Huh? No...

07:39.259 --> 07:41.178
I have it under control, okay?

07:41.220 --> 07:44.014
I can take it off
whenever I want to.

07:44.056 --> 07:46.100
Dear Marshall,

07:46.141 --> 07:49.395
I do not like
that stupid hat.

07:49.478 --> 07:52.064
I want to beat it
with a bat.

07:52.147 --> 07:54.817
Or maybe stab it
with a fork.

07:54.858 --> 07:57.152
It makes you look
like such a dork.

07:57.236 --> 08:00.030
<i>TED:
After that,
interventions became</i>

08:00.114 --> 08:01.949
<i>a pretty regular thing
around our apartment.</i>

08:02.032 --> 08:03.534
Shh.

08:06.662 --> 08:07.746
(English accent):
Cor blimey.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.289
This is a nice bloody surprise.

08:09.373 --> 08:10.958
What's this about then?

08:11.041 --> 08:12.584
Lily...

08:12.668 --> 08:16.255
it's about the weird
fake English accent.

08:16.338 --> 08:18.048
Oh, bollocks.

08:20.009 --> 08:21.468
Oh... (clears throat)

08:23.012 --> 08:25.889
Spray tan?

08:27.266 --> 08:29.393
(sobbing):
They reel you in with a coupon,

08:29.476 --> 08:31.312
and then you just get hooked.

08:31.353 --> 08:33.981
Oh, we know, sweetie, we know.

08:34.023 --> 08:36.650
No, no, no, no--
this is a new sweater.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.321
What?

08:40.404 --> 08:41.697
The magic tricks.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.116
Specifically, those
involving fire.

08:44.198 --> 08:46.493
Magic tricks?

08:46.577 --> 08:49.246
Guys, interventions are
supposed to help people,

08:49.330 --> 08:52.041
not attack every little thing
you don't like about them.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.711
I'm sorry, but that
really steams me.

08:55.794 --> 08:57.546
That really burns me up!

08:59.048 --> 09:02.593
I mean, I am filled
with a white-hot rage!

09:02.676 --> 09:04.678
(growling)

09:07.931 --> 09:08.974
(all scream)

09:09.016 --> 09:10.517
Thank you.

09:11.894 --> 09:13.187
Oh, shoot.

09:13.270 --> 09:14.980
I smell hair!
I smell hair!

09:15.064 --> 09:16.815
<i>TED:
And that's the story
of the scorch mark.</i>

09:16.857 --> 09:18.150
Wait, that's weird.

09:18.192 --> 09:19.568
When I was going
through the closet,

09:19.652 --> 09:21.737
I thought I saw
the intervention banner.

09:22.738 --> 09:23.989
S-So?

09:24.073 --> 09:26.575
So, the banner burned up.
Why is there a new one?

09:28.118 --> 09:30.120
And there are sealed letters
here from all of you

09:30.162 --> 09:31.413
that say "Ted."

09:31.497 --> 09:33.749
Were you guys planning
an intervention for me?

09:33.791 --> 09:36.251
Oh, that--
that was stupid.

09:36.335 --> 09:38.045
Yeah, just, just forget
about that.

09:38.087 --> 09:39.797
Wh-What was it for?
The Crocs?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.841
The hair product?
Not Stella.

09:44.134 --> 09:46.178
Oh, my God,
this was about Stella.

09:46.220 --> 09:49.556
I just said "Not Stella."

09:49.640 --> 09:52.643
So maybe it was about
your poor listening skills, Ted.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.311
What?
It's out of control. See?

10:04.418 --> 10:05.627
Ted, we do.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.212
We're all really happy
for you.

10:07.296 --> 10:09.464
Yeah. Like I said,
it was stupid.

10:09.548 --> 10:11.383
Well, obviously, it wasn't,
because we agreed

10:11.466 --> 10:13.260
not to have any more
stupid interventions

10:13.343 --> 10:14.511
at our intervention
intervention.

10:15.846 --> 10:19.308
We're having
too many interventions.

10:19.349 --> 10:23.645
So, what was your big, serious
oblem with me and Stella?

10:23.729 --> 10:24.813
Yes!

10:24.897 --> 10:27.149
Yes! In everyone's face!

10:27.190 --> 10:28.525
You all said

10:28.609 --> 10:29.943
the "future Barney" thing
wouldn't work.

10:30.027 --> 10:31.486
<i>You told me I was crazy.</i>

10:31.570 --> 10:34.072
<i>My shrink told me I was crazy.</i>

10:34.114 --> 10:35.657
Well, who's the narcissist

10:35.741 --> 10:38.702
with severe attachment disorder
now, Dr. Grossbard?!

10:40.704 --> 10:42.623
Intervention banner?
What's that for?

10:42.706 --> 10:45.792
Stella.
Ah.

10:46.877 --> 10:49.171
"Ted, I cannot stand idly by..."

10:49.213 --> 10:50.714
You've just been
carrying that around?

10:50.797 --> 10:51.840
Please, Ted?

10:53.008 --> 10:55.344
"I cannot stand idly by
while you make

10:55.385 --> 10:58.472
"the biggest mistake any man
can make-- getting married.

10:58.513 --> 10:59.848
"Mark my words,

10:59.932 --> 11:02.017
"this whole thing is gonna go

11:02.059 --> 11:03.727
up in flames!"

11:05.187 --> 11:06.647
Oh, damn!

11:06.730 --> 11:08.857
I put the flame cue too early.

11:08.941 --> 11:11.401
I had so many more
important things to say, and...

11:11.443 --> 11:13.445
The point is, Ted,

11:13.487 --> 11:16.698
marriage is stupid.

11:17.699 --> 11:19.117
Every year, there are

11:19.159 --> 11:21.870
a million new hot 22-year-olds

11:21.912 --> 11:24.957
walking into bars,
and call me "glass half full,"

11:25.040 --> 11:27.042
but I think
they're getting dumber.

11:27.084 --> 11:30.087
Oh, come on, Barney,
even you aren't still gonna be

11:30.170 --> 11:32.005
hitting on 22-year-olds
when you're 80.

11:33.382 --> 11:35.676
I accept that challenge.
What challenge?

11:35.717 --> 11:39.555
To prove to you that
I will be exactly this awesome

11:39.638 --> 11:43.892
when I'm 80, I will hook up
with a 22-year-old

11:43.976 --> 11:45.894
while in my old-man makeup.

11:45.978 --> 11:48.313
I didn't remotely
challenge you to that.

11:49.481 --> 11:50.899
I mean, I definitely
want to see it.

11:50.941 --> 11:53.277
But I didn't remotely
challenge you to that.

11:53.318 --> 11:55.362
I want to hear
the other letters.

11:55.445 --> 11:57.239
Ted, this is ridiculous.

11:57.322 --> 11:58.907
W-We changed our minds.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.242
And suppose
you change them back?

12:00.325 --> 12:02.119
Lily, come on,
let's hear yours.

12:02.202 --> 12:04.246
(sighs)

12:06.915 --> 12:10.085
"Gilbert's reading skills have
improved drastically since..."

12:10.168 --> 12:13.130
Wait, this is a letter
I meant to send home

12:13.213 --> 12:15.299
with one of
my kindergarteners.

12:15.382 --> 12:16.550
Uh-oh.

12:16.592 --> 12:18.927
Gilbert,
are things moving too fast

12:19.011 --> 12:21.013
between you and a girl
named Stella?

12:21.096 --> 12:23.223
I wish.

12:26.101 --> 12:28.478
Robin, could I hear yours?

12:31.899 --> 12:34.359
(sighs)

12:34.443 --> 12:35.485
"Dear Ted,
it's 'encyclo-pee-dia,'

12:35.569 --> 12:38.071
not 'encyclo-pay-dia.'

12:38.113 --> 12:39.281
"Why do you always
say things

12:39.323 --> 12:41.408
"in the most pretentious
way possible?

12:41.450 --> 12:43.577
"It makes you sound douchey--

12:43.619 --> 12:46.246
and that's 'douchey,'
not 'douch-ay.'"

12:46.288 --> 12:47.748
Yeah, you already read that one

12:47.789 --> 12:49.082
at my pronunciation
intervention.

12:49.124 --> 12:51.293
Where's the letter
about Stella?

12:51.376 --> 12:53.045
I didn't write one--
I-I'm your ex-girlfriend;

12:53.128 --> 12:56.048
I figured anything I said on
the subject would sound catty.

12:57.049 --> 12:58.675
Plus, I'm hotter than her,

12:58.717 --> 13:00.844
so who cares?

13:00.886 --> 13:02.512
Marshall?

13:02.554 --> 13:05.182
Dude, it's water
under the bridge...
Please.

13:06.225 --> 13:07.476
(sighs)

13:12.314 --> 13:16.652
"Dear Ted, Stella seems
like a wonderful person.

13:18.612 --> 13:21.156
"But you don't know her
well enough to get married.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.616
"You certainly

13:22.658 --> 13:24.034
"don't know her well enough

13:24.117 --> 13:27.329
"to commit to raising
a seven-year-old with her.

13:27.412 --> 13:30.457
"You're not
"doing her, her child

13:30.541 --> 13:33.627
"or yourself any favors
by rushing into this.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.838
Just give it some more time."

13:38.048 --> 13:40.008
Dude, that was months
ago, all right?

13:40.050 --> 13:42.052
That was before we
got to know Stella

13:42.094 --> 13:45.889
and see how awesome
she is and what a great
couple you guys are.

13:45.973 --> 13:48.517
That's why we decided not
to even have that intervention.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.519
Thank you.
Because I-I really need you guys

13:50.602 --> 13:52.104
to be on board with this.

13:52.145 --> 13:54.856
And we are.
And we hope you're
not mad at us.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.275
Course not.

13:56.316 --> 13:59.236
I mean, it's not like
what you said was crazy.

13:59.319 --> 14:01.822
Y-You had a lot
of valid concerns.
Yeah,

14:01.905 --> 14:04.491
but concerns we have
completely moved on from.

14:04.575 --> 14:06.034
But you had a point.

14:06.118 --> 14:09.329
I mean, this whole thing
has moved pretty fast.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.623
Well, you know what?
Maybe that's because, uh,

14:11.707 --> 14:13.333
when it's right,
yojust know.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.335
Yeah, I guess,
but-but we are still,

14:15.419 --> 14:17.170
you know, getting
to know each other.

14:17.212 --> 14:19.047
And, Lily, maybe
you're right.

14:19.089 --> 14:22.092
Maybe Stella won't like
any of my stuff.

14:22.175 --> 14:24.845
Like the robot cookie jar.

14:24.928 --> 14:26.513
This was, like,
the first thing

14:26.555 --> 14:28.348
we bought for this place,
remember?

14:28.432 --> 14:30.058
Of course I do.

14:30.142 --> 14:32.561
(robot voice):
Marshall, my sensors indicate

14:32.644 --> 14:36.690
that your pecan sandy levels
are dangerously low.

14:36.773 --> 14:40.277
Ah. My collection
of James Bond movies.

14:40.319 --> 14:42.321
Remember? We watched
them all in order,

14:42.362 --> 14:44.907
and then Lily spoke
in that weird English accent

14:44.948 --> 14:46.241
for, like, the next month?

14:46.325 --> 14:47.868
It was sophisticated.
No.

14:47.951 --> 14:49.077
Nope.
No.

14:49.119 --> 14:52.372
Oh!
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.

14:52.414 --> 14:54.917
My elephant lamp.

14:54.958 --> 14:56.376
The English phone booth.

14:56.418 --> 14:57.920
My sombrero!

14:58.003 --> 14:59.254
(laughs)

14:59.338 --> 15:01.882
Ted, what are you doing?

15:01.924 --> 15:03.300
Unpacking.

15:12.655 --> 15:15.157
No, no, Ted,
stop unpacking.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.659
You're just freaking out.

15:16.742 --> 15:18.452
I'm not ready for all
the responsibility.

15:18.494 --> 15:20.746
<i>And-And I'm certainly
not ready to be a step-dad</i>

15:20.788 --> 15:22.122
<i>to a seven-year-old.</i>

15:22.164 --> 15:25.167
I mean, if I get married
and move to the suburbs,

15:25.250 --> 15:27.544
in the blink of an eye,
I've become an old man!

15:29.421 --> 15:32.007
Why, hello, young lady.

15:32.049 --> 15:35.761
You want a butterscotch candy?

15:35.844 --> 15:37.930
What do you mean,
"nothing in common"?

15:38.013 --> 15:39.682
We're both seniors.

15:41.517 --> 15:43.352
(cackling)
(laughs)

15:43.435 --> 15:44.812
You're cute.

15:44.853 --> 15:46.313
How old are you?

15:46.355 --> 15:49.608
83. How old are you?

15:49.650 --> 15:50.609
Thirty-one.

15:50.651 --> 15:53.320
(groans):
Oh-oh...

15:53.362 --> 15:54.822
Okay,

15:54.863 --> 15:56.115
Ted has officially snapped.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.492
There are moving men
coming in ten hours.

15:58.575 --> 16:01.120
His fiancé–‘ is waiting for him
in New Jersey.

16:01.203 --> 16:02.621
We have to do something.

16:02.705 --> 16:04.540
I got this.

16:07.251 --> 16:08.460
Hey, bud?

16:08.544 --> 16:09.753
Hey.

16:09.837 --> 16:11.714
Why don't you come
here for a minute.

16:11.755 --> 16:13.132
What?

16:13.215 --> 16:16.343
Look, I want you to know
this is all totally normal.

16:16.385 --> 16:19.722
Big transitions can be
scary, and cold feet--

16:19.805 --> 16:21.807
well, they're just
part of the deal.

16:21.849 --> 16:25.519
So... how about you
give me the knife?

16:26.562 --> 16:28.188
Give me the knife.

16:28.272 --> 16:29.356
Come on.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.485
So I can start unpacking, too.

16:33.569 --> 16:35.821
I'm staying here right by
your side forever, buddy!

16:35.904 --> 16:37.072
Yeah!
Yeah!

16:37.114 --> 16:38.532
Marshall!
Lily,

16:38.615 --> 16:40.659
our lives have
been good here.

16:40.743 --> 16:42.995
That's why we've been
putting off packing.

16:43.078 --> 16:45.247
Because subconsciously,
we both know that

16:45.331 --> 16:46.582
it would be stupid to leave.

16:46.665 --> 16:48.542
It's safe and warm here.

16:48.584 --> 16:49.668
There's a bar downstairs,

16:49.752 --> 16:51.170
and a cookie robot
in the kitchen.

16:51.253 --> 16:53.172
This is my home,
and I'm never leaving!

16:53.213 --> 16:54.465
Listen to you!

16:54.548 --> 16:56.967
You sound like that
fat, dweeby kid at camp.

16:57.051 --> 16:58.969
"Mom, Dad, I want to come home.

16:59.053 --> 17:01.764
The cool kids are playing
keep-away with my inhaler."

17:01.847 --> 17:03.849
I can't believe
my dad read that letter

17:03.891 --> 17:05.392
at our wedding.
Marshall, you can't

17:05.476 --> 17:06.852
do this to Lily.

17:06.894 --> 17:08.395
Yes, I know your new place
has had some problems,

17:08.479 --> 17:10.606
with the slanted floors
and the nearby

17:10.647 --> 17:11.940
sewage treatment plant,

17:11.982 --> 17:13.858
but you're gonna
turn it into a great home.

17:13.942 --> 17:15.569
Tell him, Lily.

17:15.653 --> 17:18.113
It's a black hole
where dreams go to die.

17:18.196 --> 17:19.406
I'm not moving, either.

17:19.448 --> 17:21.659
Oh, come on!
Yes!

17:21.742 --> 17:22.910
Okay, you guys finish unpacking.

17:22.951 --> 17:24.411
I'm gonna go
bake some cookies

17:24.453 --> 17:26.747
to fill
R2-Sweet Tooth.

17:26.789 --> 17:29.166
Oh, my God, look at you cowards!

17:29.249 --> 17:31.502
So afraid of any kind of change.

17:31.543 --> 17:33.879
So terrified of anything new.

17:33.921 --> 17:35.381
So-so desperate to cling

17:35.422 --> 17:37.216
to anything
comfortable and familiar.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.051
I can't move to Japan.

17:39.134 --> 17:41.303
Yes!
Whoa!

17:41.345 --> 17:42.304
What was I thinking?

17:42.346 --> 17:43.764
It's so far away.

17:43.847 --> 17:45.224
And I don't speak the language.

17:45.307 --> 17:46.558
(crying):
I didn't even have

17:46.642 --> 17:49.687
any good pictures of you guys.
Oh, sweetie.

17:49.770 --> 17:50.813
Everybody says

17:50.854 --> 17:52.147
change is so great, right?

17:52.231 --> 17:53.857
But what's so great
about change?

17:53.941 --> 17:56.026
Hey, who wants
to walk down to our

17:56.110 --> 17:57.945
same old bar,
sit in our regular booth

17:58.028 --> 17:59.196
and order the usual?!

17:59.279 --> 18:02.324
Yeah!
The usual!
My favorite!

18:05.119 --> 18:06.912
Oh, my God.

18:06.954 --> 18:08.414
(disgusted groan)

18:12.001 --> 18:13.794
Well, well, well.

18:13.877 --> 18:14.962
I believe

18:15.045 --> 18:18.132
someone owes me $200.

18:18.215 --> 18:20.718
Barney, this was
never a bet-- nobody...

18:20.801 --> 18:24.471
This proves that I will be
this awesome when I'm 80.

18:24.513 --> 18:26.515
Arthritis five.

18:28.851 --> 18:30.978
I'm moving to New Jersey.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.604
What?
And you and
Marshall

18:32.646 --> 18:35.607
should move to your new place,
and Robin should go to Japan.

18:35.649 --> 18:36.650
Why?

18:36.734 --> 18:37.776
Because we're gonna get older

18:37.818 --> 18:39.069
whether we like it or not,

18:39.153 --> 18:40.654
so the only
question is

18:40.738 --> 18:43.282
whether we want
to get on with our lives

18:43.365 --> 18:46.452
or desperately cling to the past
and end up like that.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.162
You mean awesome?

18:49.163 --> 18:50.622
I'm 80, dude,

18:50.706 --> 18:53.250
and I'm making out
with a 22-year-old.

18:54.585 --> 18:56.587
<i>(French accent):
Take me to your
place, cheri.</i>

18:56.670 --> 18:59.256
I want to see your
World War II medals.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.759
<i>(chuckles):
In a minute, mon petite.</i>

19:01.842 --> 19:03.927
All right, so that
doesn't count.

19:04.011 --> 19:05.429
What? Why?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.513
She's French--
that's like

19:06.555 --> 19:08.015
playing tennis
with the net down.

19:09.016 --> 19:10.517
You know what?

19:10.559 --> 19:12.102
I'll cover the security deposit.

19:12.144 --> 19:13.687
I'm glad to, because...

19:13.771 --> 19:15.439
every dent in that place

19:15.522 --> 19:17.650
represents a memory
that I'll cherish forever.

19:17.691 --> 19:19.193
But on one condition:

19:19.276 --> 19:22.613
we all put aside ten bucks
every week for the next year,

19:22.696 --> 19:25.991
and we come back here and we
buy that 50-year-old scotch,

19:26.075 --> 19:27.951
and we toast
the incredible

19:27.993 --> 19:29.953
life-changing year
we've all had.

19:29.995 --> 19:32.498
(quietly):
Get out of our booth.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.210
Me with my new family,

19:36.251 --> 19:39.046
Marshall and Lily in their
new apartment, and Robin

19:39.088 --> 19:41.256
as the number one
English-speaking journalist

19:41.340 --> 19:42.549
in the Pacific Rim,

19:42.633 --> 19:43.842
visiting us

19:43.926 --> 19:46.387
here in New York
to celebrate this day--

19:46.470 --> 19:48.097
the day we closed

19:48.180 --> 19:49.682
an incredible chapter
in our lives,

19:49.723 --> 19:51.517
only to open up a new one.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.643
Mm.

19:52.685 --> 19:53.978
Um, I think I
left my cell...

19:54.019 --> 19:55.270
Get out of here.

19:57.982 --> 20:00.734
<i>NARRATOR:
And one year later,
that's exactly what we did.</i>

20:00.818 --> 20:02.653
And so let's raise a glass

20:02.736 --> 20:05.656
of $2,500 scotch
to one hell of a year.

20:05.739 --> 20:07.408
Mm.

20:09.243 --> 20:10.911
Amazing.
Mm-mm!

20:10.953 --> 20:12.663
That's unbelievable.

20:12.746 --> 20:15.582
It's kind of smoky,
with a hint of aged cedar and...

20:15.666 --> 20:18.168
Do you guys taste the difference
and ten-dollar scotch?

20:18.252 --> 20:19.336
Not at all.
No difference.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.629
I want to cut mine
with Red Bull.

20:20.713 --> 20:23.841
Oh, Wendy, can you
take a picture?

20:23.882 --> 20:26.218
<i>NARRATOR:
A lot of things
did change that year,</i>

20:26.302 --> 20:28.762
<i>but some things
stayed the same.</i>

20:28.846 --> 20:30.431
So, uh, what do you say

20:30.514 --> 20:32.641
we move this party
upstairs to the apartment?

20:32.683 --> 20:34.226
Yeah.
Great idea.

20:34.310 --> 20:36.145
I got the scotch.

20:42.549 --> 20:44.217
What the...?

20:45.718 --> 20:48.513
Barney, this is
an intervention.

20:48.555 --> 20:51.933
(old man voice):
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

20:52.016 --> 20:54.185
Enough with
the "old man" bit.

20:54.269 --> 20:57.021
What about the old sand pit?

20:57.105 --> 20:58.648
Let it go.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.150
"Let It Snow"?

21:00.191 --> 21:02.110
I love that old ditty!

21:03.403 --> 21:05.905
I'm getting my flail.

21:05.947 --> 21:08.116
You're setting sail?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
