01:41.393 --> 01:43.895
This way! Take it!

02:05.083 --> 02:06.292
More pressure!

02:15.885 --> 02:17.679
Reposition those rigs!

03:09.314 --> 03:11.308
IC from Ladder 42,
we are on side two...

03:11.408 --> 03:14.394
Jack! Jack!

03:14.494 --> 03:15.896
Everybody, listen up.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.398
The battalion chief says
we've got a report of people...

03:18.498 --> 03:20.400
...trapped on the 12th floor or above.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.612
He says the place is full of grain dust,
which could explode at any time.

03:23.712 --> 03:26.790
So everybody keep together,
maintain radio contact.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.909
Check that
on the three side of the building.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.996
Is that all right? You got that?
Roger, IC. Three side of the building.

03:33.096 --> 03:36.541
Why does it always have to be
the 12th floor?

03:36.641 --> 03:38.593
Why can't they be on the fourth?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.513
Let's move it, Grandpa.
Come on.

03:44.099 --> 03:47.594
Ladder 49 to Command.
We're on the 12th floor.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.979
Commencing search.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.810
I'm getting too old for this shit.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.696
Lenny! Lenny!
Take Jack.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.490
Ray!
All right, Cap.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.617
- Come on, Jack.
- Copy that.

04:04.995 --> 04:09.416
This is Baltimore City Fire Department!
Can anybody hear me?

04:11.292 --> 04:12.585
Fire Department!

04:12.711 --> 04:15.088
Baltimore City Fire Department.
Can anybody hear me?

04:15.213 --> 04:19.209
Fire Department!
Anybody here?

04:19.309 --> 04:20.719
Hello?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.311
Fire Department!

04:35.191 --> 04:38.103
Hey! Jack!

04:38.203 --> 04:39.487
He's over here!

04:47.495 --> 04:49.289
I got a pulse.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.492
Ladder 49, Portable three to Portable one.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.369
We found one of 'em.
He's alive.

04:54.469 --> 04:56.705
We're bringing him out.
Jack, get his hands.

04:56.805 --> 04:58.790
Portable one to Portable three.

04:58.890 --> 05:00.250
Copy that. We got one, too.

05:00.350 --> 05:02.594
We'll meet you at the stairwell.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.092
Give us a hand here!
Breathe through my mask.

05:09.192 --> 05:10.802
Go ahead, just take a breath
outta my mask.

05:10.902 --> 05:12.304
I got him! I got him!
Ladder 49 to Command.

05:12.404 --> 05:13.638
I got his legs.

05:13.738 --> 05:16.099
Be advised we have
two trapped occupants.

05:16.199 --> 05:17.484
We're bringing 'em down the stairs now.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.486
Where's Phil?
What?

05:19.611 --> 05:20.604
Phil.

05:20.704 --> 05:22.781
Cap, they said there was two of 'em.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.900
He was with us.
They said there were only two.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.903
On this level!
On this floor. Over there.

05:28.003 --> 05:31.698
I'm gonna go look for him.
Jack! You stay in radio contact.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.792
Ok.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.717
Fire Department!

05:43.301 --> 05:44.719
Aah!

06:06.783 --> 06:10.787
Portable three to Portable one.
Explosion blocked my rear exit.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.491
Looking for alternative,
but still searching for a victim on level 12.

06:14.591 --> 06:17.919
Ladder 49, Portable one to Portable three.
We copy, Jack.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.210
Hey! Hey!

06:25.310 --> 06:27.212
Come on. Get up!

06:27.312 --> 06:29.514
Can you stand?
Come on, let's go.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.303
Come on.

06:35.403 --> 06:37.188
Ladder 49, Portable one to Portable three.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.982
Jack, you all right?
Yeah. I got another one.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.311
Portable three to Command.
Be advised I have the victim.

06:43.411 --> 06:45.989
We're moving toward side one,
the roll-up door.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.491
Get a bucket up there
and I'll drop him down!

06:48.616 --> 06:50.694
Command, do you copy?

06:50.794 --> 06:53.488
Copy that. We are repositioning truck 51.

06:53.588 --> 06:54.706
Come on!

07:03.298 --> 07:05.300
Nice and easy.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.098
Hey! Come on, get it up here! Up!

07:14.517 --> 07:16.686
Truck 51 to Ladder 49 Portable.

07:16.811 --> 07:21.107
We're right underneath you.
Bring him down, Jack. Bring him down.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.695
What's your name? Phil?
Yeah, it's Phil.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.689
Here, Phil, can you hold this?

07:27.789 --> 07:29.991
Can you hold this against your face?

07:33.703 --> 07:37.207
Listen to me. I'm gonna
tie you off right now, all right?

07:41.503 --> 07:44.589
Nice and easy.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.167
Portable three to Command,
ready to lower the victim down.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.710
All right, Phil, now listen to me.

07:48.810 --> 07:50.754
Take this off.
Listen to me.

07:50.854 --> 07:53.090
I'm gonna start lowering you
down now right into the bucket.

07:53.190 --> 07:55.183
Now trust me.
Keep your eyes on me, Ok?

07:55.308 --> 07:58.395
You keep your eyes on me.
I got you. Trust me.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.392
Hey, Phil, you look at me.

08:03.492 --> 08:05.435
You look at me and stay right there.

08:05.535 --> 08:08.279
I can't do this.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.190
I'm right here.
You could do it, Phil.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.993
I can't do this.
Yes, you can. I'm gonna help you.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.287
I got guys on the ground.
Trust me, Phil. Trust me.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.408
Please, I can't.
You have to go.

08:19.508 --> 08:21.084
Now, I'm not leaving till you leave.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.087
And you're going, Phil.
Down! Get down!

08:24.212 --> 08:26.999
Go down. I got you.
I promise. I got you.

08:27.099 --> 08:28.591
Go. You just look right here.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.597
Aah! Uh...

08:45.400 --> 08:47.902
You got 30 feet, Jack.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.791
Stay right here, partner!
Stay right here!

09:01.916 --> 09:03.793
Jack, you got ten, 15 feet.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.879
Bring him down.
Bring him down.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.887
Aah!

09:53.802 --> 09:55.720
Aah!

10:22.497 --> 10:24.082
We got heavy black smoke up here.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.494
We got a four-by-four hole cut.
We can't get in there yet.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.997
Ladder 12, this is Ladder 6.
We need the big booster.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.506
Bring in a big line.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.448
Hey. You the new rookie?

11:05.548 --> 11:07.450
Uh, yeah, I'm looking for, uh, Captain...

11:07.550 --> 11:09.294
Hey, yo, Frank. What's up?
What's up, Tommy?

11:09.419 --> 11:11.788
Drop your bag.
Uh, take the spiral staircase.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.790
Look for the door
that says 'Captain's Office.'

11:13.890 --> 11:15.884
Thanks.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.050
What's up?
Any breakfast?

11:24.150 --> 11:25.894
Yeah, in the kitchen.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.695
You're the rookie, right?
Yeah.

11:45.789 --> 11:49.292
Uh, probationary firefighter
Jack Morrison reporting, sir.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.587
Sir?

11:55.006 --> 11:56.800
Sir?

12:02.806 --> 12:04.800
Your shift started at seven, son.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.602
Uh, well, sir, I was already here.
Ah, save it. Sit down.

12:11.690 --> 12:15.102
Now, let me tell you somethin', boy.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.896
Engine 33 is the busiest...

12:17.996 --> 12:20.899
...and most disciplined firehouse in the city.

12:20.999 --> 12:24.285
No room for slackers.
You got that?

12:24.411 --> 12:25.904
I know that, sir.

12:26.004 --> 12:28.081
We get over 4,000 calls a year.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.791
That's a lot of action.

12:29.916 --> 12:33.294
Gotta be willing to go the extra mile.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.381
Are you, Jack?
Are you willing to go the extra mile?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.717
Well, yes, sir.
I don't think so.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.504
I can.

12:42.604 --> 12:45.390
Sorry, Cap.
Uh, Father Hogan's here.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.303
Uh, I'll go last. I'll go last.
Let him go first.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.889
Go ahead. Go ahead, Jack.

12:52.989 --> 12:56.985
Yeah, so, Jack... Ok.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.487
Welcome to, uh, Engine 33.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.439
Good to have you onboard, son.
Get out.

13:01.539 --> 13:03.283
Well, thank you, sir.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.787
Hey. Ray Gauquin.
How are you?

13:07.912 --> 13:10.790
Jack Morrison.
Good to meet you.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.243
Uh... so, the captain...

13:13.343 --> 13:15.295
He's a great guy.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.010
Uh, right down here.
You can use this one.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.889
This one?
Yeah.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.508
You Catholic?
Yeah.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.894
Most of the guys are.
Uh... we have a thing here.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.479
A priest comes around twice a year.

13:32.604 --> 13:36.266
We all go to confession.
In this job, you need it.

13:36.366 --> 13:39.986
I mean, you get enough fires, you find God.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.196
Yeah.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.111
A good confession now, son.
'Bless me, Father...'

13:48.211 --> 13:50.789
Uh, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.158
It's been, uh...

13:53.258 --> 13:55.911
...seven years since my last confession.

13:56.011 --> 13:59.706
Seven years is a long time.
Yes, Father.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.500
All right, where do we start?

14:01.600 --> 14:06.596
Theft? Robbery?
Fraud? Taxes?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.892
Well, you know.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.020
Taxes? Always taxes.

14:14.688 --> 14:19.109
How 'bout sex?
Lmpure thoughts?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.312
Well, yes, quite a bit.

14:22.412 --> 14:24.564
Try to cut back.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.566
Are you married?
No.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.611
Are you a virgin?
No, Father.

14:29.711 --> 14:32.414
Oh, you think it's funny to
fornicate with loose women?

14:34.582 --> 14:36.868
What? Wait a minute.

14:36.968 --> 14:38.795
No, you wait a minute.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.000
You come across any more loose women,
you let me know.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.501
Tommy Drake.
Jack Morrison.

14:44.601 --> 14:46.503
Hey, man. Don Miller.
Good to meet you.

14:46.603 --> 14:47.887
Dennis Gauquin.
Hey.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.799
My older and, as you
can see, uglier brother.

14:50.899 --> 14:52.634
Frank McKinney.
Father.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.394
Lenny Richter. Father Lenny Richter.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.979
Pleasure to meet you.
Good sport.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.105
Cap.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.399
You think we'll get
something today or what?

15:07.499 --> 15:10.118
I don't know, kid.
I think you put a hex on us.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.905
Uh, did you report a fire, ma'am?

15:14.005 --> 15:15.991
I burned some bread
in the oven, that's all.

15:16.091 --> 15:18.535
Oh, well,
can we come in and check, please?

15:18.635 --> 15:21.296
You put one foot in here,
this dog'll tear your ass off.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.384
Get in there, probie.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.189
Come here.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.393
Yeah?

15:43.493 --> 15:45.987
What the hell's this?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.782
What?
Are you stupid?

15:51.409 --> 15:54.287
There's no paper.
Yeah, it's right there.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.706
It's not on the holder.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.202
Why don't you use your hand?
You're used to it.

16:00.302 --> 16:02.420
Hey, who asked your opinion?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.307
Get outta the bathroom.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.489
Oh, God...! Goddamn it.

16:37.589 --> 16:40.701
All right, who's the wise guy?
All right.

16:40.801 --> 16:44.087
Interrupting my sh...
Goddamn it!

16:45.505 --> 16:47.590
All right, somebody's gonna pay for this!

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
We got one, rook!

16:57.809 --> 16:59.811
Come on, come on!

17:47.484 --> 17:50.395
About three more blocks.
Right after North Avenue.

17:50.495 --> 17:52.197
All right, Cap.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.091
Move out of the way, asshole!

18:18.515 --> 18:21.051
How you feelin', kid?
It's your first fire.

18:21.151 --> 18:24.187
Are you ready to break your cherry?

18:27.982 --> 18:32.112
That one. Grab that plug!
Got you, Cap.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.081
Three-story brick building.
Flames showing second and third floor.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.419
Go! Go! Go! Go!

18:50.005 --> 18:52.007
Go, go, go!

18:57.595 --> 18:59.681
Your helmet!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.604
Slow down. Slow down.

19:14.704 --> 19:16.489
You're getting tangled up.
Let it go, let it go.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.442
Single line, single line.
Come on. Let it go.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.286
All right, there you go.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.991
Go in low.
All right, stop here.

19:26.091 --> 19:30.086
Stop, stop.
Charge the line!

19:30.211 --> 19:31.296
Charge it!

19:36.885 --> 19:38.336
All right.

19:38.436 --> 19:40.680
Go! Go!

19:43.391 --> 19:46.394
Over the side!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.188
Slow down!
Slow... slow down!

19:48.313 --> 19:49.481
Whoa. Whoa.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.192
Huh?
Go!

19:54.819 --> 19:57.697
Keep goin'!

19:58.615 --> 20:00.492
Jesus Christ!
They're just rats.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.495
Come on, let's go.
Cap... Huh?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.789
Go!

20:09.584 --> 20:11.703
Hey, Cap...
Ignore it! Go!

20:11.803 --> 20:13.505
Ok.
Just keep goin'.

20:23.682 --> 20:26.510
Drop it. Drop it.
Drop down.

20:26.610 --> 20:28.520
Ok, Ok...
This is it.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.058
You ready? Move it in!
Come on, move it!

20:33.158 --> 20:35.560
What?
No, not yet. Not yet.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.487
When? When?

20:37.612 --> 20:40.907
Move in. Now, now!
I got it, Cap, I got it!

20:44.494 --> 20:47.080
Easy, easy. Hit it! Hit it!
Ok! Ok!

20:48.415 --> 20:50.083
I'm with ya,
I'm with ya.

20:50.208 --> 20:54.004
Hit it high.
Hit it high!

20:55.588 --> 20:58.000
I'm trying, I'm trying!
Good.

20:58.100 --> 21:01.302
Move in. Now, now!
That's it.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.888
Aah!

21:04.014 --> 21:05.890
It's all right. Get up!

21:06.016 --> 21:07.183
Get up!
I'm Ok, I'm Ok!

21:07.308 --> 21:09.185
Here! Here!
Come on, I got it.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.314
I'm doin' it, Cap!

21:15.316 --> 21:18.144
Up! Up! Hit it high!
Hit it high!

21:18.244 --> 21:21.564
Hit it high!
Easy. Easy.

21:21.664 --> 21:23.900
Hit it! Hit it!
Ok!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.618
Ok!

21:35.003 --> 21:36.880
You did it, man. Good job.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.882
Whoo!

21:39.007 --> 21:41.009
Hey, how 'bout that?

21:43.303 --> 21:45.096
She go easy on you?

22:12.207 --> 22:14.701
Get me up to speed.
We've got a 20-story building.

22:14.801 --> 22:17.704
Most of it concrete.
Most of the fire's on the top eight floors.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.499
And after that explosion on 12,
one of our guys went missing.

22:20.599 --> 22:23.593
Jack Morrison, Ladder 49.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.796
Any radio contact with him?
None.

22:25.896 --> 22:28.181
Anybody with him?
The others of Ladder 49 made it out.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.509
They're in the stairwell with the victims.

22:30.609 --> 22:32.052
You reported this?
Yes, sir.

22:32.152 --> 22:35.097
Ok. Deputy Chief One to communications.

22:35.197 --> 22:37.099
I'm on location assuming command.

22:37.199 --> 22:38.892
Strike out a fourth alarm.

22:38.992 --> 22:42.145
Ok, shut down all exterior operations.

22:42.245 --> 22:45.281
Get your asses in there
and find him. Go, go, go.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.695
Command to Ladder 49.
Jack, come in.

22:49.795 --> 22:52.580
Command to Ladder 49.
Jack, come in.

22:56.084 --> 22:59.955
Command to Ladder 49.
Jack, come in.

23:00.055 --> 23:02.298
Jack, come in.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.596
Ladder 49, Morrison to Command.

23:10.015 --> 23:14.019
Jack. Jack, it's Kennedy.
How you holdin' up?

23:16.479 --> 23:18.431
Chief, the floor collapsed.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.817
I don't know.
I'm pretty busted up.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.780
Do you know where you are?

23:28.491 --> 23:31.444
No. I was on 12 when it gave way.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.530
I was on 12.

23:33.630 --> 23:36.366
How you doin' on air?

23:36.466 --> 23:39.711
Tank is no good. Air's out.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.716
Ok, hold tight.
We got units comin' in after you.

23:46.217 --> 23:48.211
Hey, Mike.

23:48.311 --> 23:52.299
Mike, the vic get out?
Did he get in the bucket?

23:52.399 --> 23:54.301
That's affirmative, Jack.
He made it.

23:54.401 --> 23:58.104
He's gonna be Ok.
You did a great job.

23:59.898 --> 24:02.484
Jack, switch to a different channel.
Try eight.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.403
Switch to a different channel.
Try eight.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.941
Hey, Mike... imagine me getting myself...

24:10.041 --> 24:13.286
...trapped in here like some dumb rookie.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.580
You should've taught me better.

24:16.581 --> 24:21.503
Well, what do you expect? I did the best
I could with what I had to work with.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.300
No. No academy fire was ever that hot.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.010
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?

24:37.110 --> 24:39.012
Nothing compares, right?
Nothin'.

24:39.112 --> 24:40.313
I can't believe it.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.984
Hey, we need ketchup.
Right.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.987
Maybe more.
Ok.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.204
That's it.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.086
I'm goin' in.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.338
Uh, excuse me. Hi.

25:13.438 --> 25:15.507
Hi.
So, can I ask you a question?

25:15.607 --> 25:18.184
Sure.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.186
Now, who are these for?

25:20.311 --> 25:22.480
For us.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.808
Really?
Yeah.

25:24.908 --> 25:26.643
Um, you can't eat these.

25:26.743 --> 25:28.144
Why not?

25:28.244 --> 25:30.563
These, these are,
these are for fat, lonely girls...

25:30.663 --> 25:32.991
...who stay at home at night watching TV.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.402
Lasagna is for the fat girls?
Yes!

25:35.502 --> 25:39.080
Lieutenant, right?
Yeah, that's right.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.994
Lieutenant Jack Morrison.

25:44.094 --> 25:45.587
Hey.
Hey.

25:45.712 --> 25:49.791
I'm Captain Dennis Gauquin.

25:49.891 --> 25:52.093
Uh, Cliff's Crab Shack,
you ever heard of that?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.962
No.
Best seafood in town.

25:54.062 --> 25:56.181
That's what you need.
Oh, really?

25:56.306 --> 25:59.092
Sorry, we can't do it.
We already planned dinner.

25:59.192 --> 26:01.686
Thanks, though.
Yeah.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.605
Ok.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.101
Hey, you know where the ketchup is?

26:08.201 --> 26:10.896
Maybe.

26:10.996 --> 26:14.199
All right, can you show me?
Sure.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.284
Ok.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.903
Ketchup, huh?
Been fightin' fires all day.

26:18.003 --> 26:19.579
I need some help finding the ketchup.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.907
Sorry. The captain's been
under a lot of pressure.

26:22.007 --> 26:25.585
We had a big fire today and I think
the, uh, smoke probably went to his head.

26:25.710 --> 26:29.089
It doesn't seem to be his head
that's the problem, Lieutenant.

26:29.214 --> 26:30.882
That's funny.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.503
Hey, I'm Jack Morrison.

26:34.603 --> 26:37.339
Yeah.
He told me, remember?

26:37.439 --> 26:40.509
Oh, yeah, that's right.

26:40.609 --> 26:43.804
So, you guys usually pick up girls
in the supermarket, for fun or...?

26:43.904 --> 26:49.484
Well, usually I just throw 'em over
my shoulder and carry 'em down a ladder.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.779
Sort of a Tarzan-Jane thing?

26:58.118 --> 26:59.611
It was nice to meet you.
I should get going.

26:59.711 --> 27:01.413
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.713
Bye.
Bye.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.884
Eight o'clock.

27:15.010 --> 27:17.004
What?
Cliff's.

27:17.104 --> 27:19.014
With those girls?

27:21.182 --> 27:24.135
You mean, like if you lock yourself out?
Yeah.

27:24.235 --> 27:26.429
Well, if you lock yourself out...

27:26.529 --> 27:28.932
...and you say that you
left the stove on, yeah...

27:29.032 --> 27:32.310
...the fire department
has to come let you in.

27:32.410 --> 27:34.354
But we try to stop people from doing that...

27:34.454 --> 27:36.990
...by knocking down their door
with an ax. Right, Jack?

27:40.201 --> 27:43.288
Wanna go outside for a smoke?
Oh, more than anything.

27:43.413 --> 27:44.531
Let's go.
You guys Ok?

27:44.631 --> 27:46.408
We're goin' outside for a smoke.

27:46.508 --> 27:48.918
Bye. Behave.

27:59.804 --> 28:03.133
So, what do you do?

28:03.233 --> 28:06.603
I work in a jewelry store
where people make their own jewelry.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.807
Did you make those?
Do you make your bracelets?

28:10.907 --> 28:14.644
I made this one, and I made this.

28:14.744 --> 28:16.696
It's nice.

28:18.281 --> 28:21.651
So, what's that called?
Would you be, like, an artist?

28:21.751 --> 28:24.404
No, I just help people make jewelry.

28:24.504 --> 28:27.582
It's just a job for now.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.202
Do you like what you do?

28:30.302 --> 28:32.245
Yeah, I love it.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.247
Yeah? Why?

28:34.347 --> 28:38.460
'Cause you'll just be sittin' around like this,
and all of a sudden that gong goes off.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.887
You go tearing out of the firehouse,
go down the street...

28:41.012 --> 28:43.006
...and fight your way into some building...

28:43.106 --> 28:47.010
...dealing with that heat,
helping people, you know.

28:47.110 --> 28:50.689
Saving people.
It's an amazing feeling.

28:52.691 --> 28:56.194
I can't even imagine what it must feel like
to save someone's life.

28:56.319 --> 28:58.988
I mean, how many people
do you think you've saved?

28:59.114 --> 29:03.193
Well...
Look, actually, I'm...

29:03.293 --> 29:05.404
I'm not a lieutenant.
I just...

29:05.504 --> 29:08.407
We were just screwing around.
I actually just started, uh...

29:08.507 --> 29:10.659
You suck.
Yeah, I got my first fire today, though.

29:10.759 --> 29:13.912
But I did. I got my first fire.
It was amazing.

29:14.012 --> 29:16.498
Captain Dennis sent them over.

29:16.598 --> 29:18.792
Thank you.
Thanks.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.293
I hate you.

29:20.393 --> 29:22.295
He's gonna be Chief Dennis
in another hour.

29:22.395 --> 29:25.465
You suck!
Is he even a fireman?

29:25.565 --> 29:29.302
No, he's a truckie. He's a step man.
Truckies are search and rescue.

29:29.402 --> 29:33.314
He actually goes in and pulls people out,
you know. Dennis has saved people.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.984
Are you a steppie, too?

29:36.109 --> 29:38.486
Not a steppie, a truckie.
Oh, Ok.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.689
But, no, I'm on the engine.
I'm a pipe man.

29:40.789 --> 29:45.201
I actually hold the nozzle
and put the fire out.

29:49.414 --> 29:51.916
That's cool.

29:53.084 --> 29:55.495
I think it's amazing what you guys do.

29:55.595 --> 29:58.498
I mean, you go into burning buildings...

29:58.598 --> 30:01.167
...when everyone else is running out.

30:01.267 --> 30:04.804
I mean...
I couldn't do that.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.309
It's the job.

30:14.189 --> 30:17.192
What's goin' on, guys?
Not much, man.

30:40.215 --> 30:44.511
Nice. Nice one, guys.
How you doin'?

30:45.595 --> 30:47.305
Jack Morrison! Phone call!

30:47.514 --> 30:49.299
Jack Morrison! Phone call!

30:49.399 --> 30:52.594
Some woman named Linda claiming you
to be the father of her child.

30:52.694 --> 30:54.187
Ohh!

30:57.899 --> 31:01.319
Hello.
Hey, how you doin'?

31:03.196 --> 31:05.281
No. Uh, yeah.

31:08.994 --> 31:12.998
Uh, fires, no.
But I did have a goose.

31:14.582 --> 31:16.994
A goose in my locker.
It was huge.

31:17.094 --> 31:19.496
Crapped all over my stuff.

31:19.596 --> 31:22.332
Come on, Jack, you startin'
a phone-sex business here?

31:22.432 --> 31:24.167
Go ahead and tell her you love her, Jack.

31:24.267 --> 31:27.303
Hey, look, I gotta go.
Can I call you later?

31:30.682 --> 31:33.810
Ok. Bye.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.890
Aw!
Sweet stuff.

31:38.990 --> 31:41.317
Sweet stuff!

31:46.281 --> 31:48.491
Irish Car Bomb?
Come on, Mike.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.493
Don, you want one?

31:57.000 --> 32:00.503
Linda! Linda!
Hey!

32:03.506 --> 32:05.709
Hey, hold up.
This must be the lovely Linda.

32:05.809 --> 32:07.294
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Frank, Linda.

32:07.394 --> 32:08.595
This is Don.
Hey, Linda.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.888
Hi.
And Tommy.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.798
How you doin'?
I think you know him.

32:11.898 --> 32:15.010
Uh-huh. Margarita sends her love.
Ah, Margarita.

32:15.110 --> 32:16.595
That's Captain Kennedy.
How do you do?

32:16.695 --> 32:19.306
Hi. I've heard a lot about you.
Yeah?

32:19.406 --> 32:22.601
Yeah, you wear really sexy boxers, right?
With red love hearts on them?

32:22.701 --> 32:23.810
Oh, gosh.

32:23.910 --> 32:26.988
A little too tight.
Ah, sit, have a seat.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.149
What are you...?
I had to.

32:29.249 --> 32:31.902
Linda, have you ever had one of these?
No, don't do it.

32:32.002 --> 32:33.787
What is this?
Oh, it's an Irish Car Bomb.

32:33.912 --> 32:35.580
Yeah. Here, you put it in like this...

32:35.705 --> 32:37.991
...let it drop right in there,
and chug it all at once.

32:38.091 --> 32:40.794
Are you doing one?
You're gonna love it. Ready? You ready?

32:40.919 --> 32:42.704
Oh, it's gonna make me sick.
Come on. Now...

32:42.804 --> 32:44.289
One, two, three.

32:44.389 --> 32:47.667
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink...

32:47.767 --> 32:50.387
Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

32:50.512 --> 32:52.305
Go, go, go, go!

32:58.186 --> 33:00.480
Wow.

33:00.605 --> 33:02.641
Oh, my God.

33:02.741 --> 33:05.102
What was that?

33:05.202 --> 33:07.987
I'm going to be so sick tomorrow.

33:08.113 --> 33:09.564
Ohh!

33:09.664 --> 33:12.283
Let's get another shot!

33:20.291 --> 33:22.369
I think I gotta slow down a bit.

33:22.469 --> 33:24.788
No, you gotta get wasted at a shift party.
That's tradition.

33:24.888 --> 33:30.168
No, no, no, Jack, the lady knows her
limitations. Let her go. Send her home.

33:30.268 --> 33:32.295
Are you calling me a lightweight?

33:32.395 --> 33:33.680
Yeah.
Lightweight.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.890
Ohh!
Stand back!

33:36.016 --> 33:39.803
Ok. Last one to empty their glasses
runs naked around the bar.

33:39.903 --> 33:41.262
We got a challenge!
Oh, we got a race here!

33:41.362 --> 33:42.806
We got a challenge.
Ok, Ok.

33:42.906 --> 33:45.392
All right. Loser takes off all their clothes.

33:45.492 --> 33:46.601
Call it.

33:46.701 --> 33:49.404
Ready, on three.
One, two, three.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.942
No, no, no.
What the hell is that?

33:54.042 --> 33:57.988
I said last to empty their glass.
Did I say anything about drinking it?

33:58.088 --> 34:00.490
Tom, the lady's right, Tommy.
Ohh.

34:00.590 --> 34:03.084
See, oh, we got a cute one here now, huh?

34:03.209 --> 34:05.086
Take it off! Take it off!
I was very clear.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.088
Take it off!
Take it off!

34:07.213 --> 34:08.706
Take it off!
Take it off!

34:08.806 --> 34:10.717
Take it off!
Take it off!

34:35.199 --> 34:37.118
Take that.

34:51.091 --> 34:54.511
Oh, please kill me.

35:06.189 --> 35:09.309
I like this.
Hm?

35:09.409 --> 35:12.104
Oh. My mom gave it to me.

35:12.204 --> 35:14.230
You know what this is?
Mm-mm.

35:14.330 --> 35:16.783
It's a Claddagh ring.

35:16.908 --> 35:19.995
You know, if it's pointed down...

35:20.120 --> 35:22.706
...then it means that you're free.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.586
And if it's pointed up
towards your heart...

35:30.380 --> 35:33.216
...then it means that you
belong to someone.

36:10.003 --> 36:12.455
Clear.

36:12.555 --> 36:14.883
Come on, Lenny.
Let's go.

36:17.594 --> 36:19.304
Go.

36:25.685 --> 36:27.596
Oh, God.

36:27.696 --> 36:30.307
Jack!

36:30.407 --> 36:31.892
Jack!

36:31.992 --> 36:34.895
IC, Ladder 12.
Requesting air rescue to deploy.

36:34.995 --> 36:38.064
Jack.

36:38.164 --> 36:41.910
Oh, God. Oh, God.

36:47.582 --> 36:49.501
Jack!

36:50.794 --> 36:52.212
Oh, God.

36:53.505 --> 36:57.092
I need a goddamn progress report,
Ladder 49.

37:01.179 --> 37:03.006
Ladder 49 to Command.

37:03.106 --> 37:05.967
Be advised we have
structural collapse inside.

37:06.067 --> 37:08.395
There's a huge amount of debris.
There's no way around it.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.889
I don't care what your problem is.
Just keep goin'.

37:10.989 --> 37:13.058
We're gonna need
some equipment up here.

37:13.158 --> 37:15.193
Equipment's on its way.
Copy that, Chief.

37:17.987 --> 37:19.280
IC from Ladder 42.

37:19.406 --> 37:22.693
We are on side two,
awaiting instructions. Over.

37:22.793 --> 37:25.203
Lenny. Lenny!

37:30.208 --> 37:32.585
Cap, how are we gonna
get through all this?

37:35.213 --> 37:38.000
Squad 47 here!
What do you need?

37:38.100 --> 37:39.592
We need that equipment over here!

37:39.718 --> 37:42.212
You got it!
Give me a saw!

37:42.312 --> 37:43.805
Come on!

37:47.809 --> 37:50.186
We need to shore this.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.188
Come on, we gotta shore this up!

38:07.996 --> 38:09.497
Clear!

38:12.417 --> 38:14.502
Watch your heads through here!

38:25.680 --> 38:27.682
Jack!

38:32.604 --> 38:34.890
Uh, Ladder 49, uh, this is...

38:34.990 --> 38:36.850
Aah!

38:36.950 --> 38:39.402
Son of a bitch!
We got a flare!

38:59.214 --> 39:01.333
May the Lord bless you
with many happy years together...

39:01.433 --> 39:04.002
...so that you may enjoy
the rewards of a good life.

39:04.102 --> 39:07.005
And after you have loyally
served in His kingdom on Earth...

39:07.105 --> 39:10.050
...may He welcome you into
the kingdom in heaven. Amen.

39:10.150 --> 39:12.302
And may Almighty God bless you
in the name of the Father...

39:12.402 --> 39:15.389
...and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

39:15.489 --> 39:17.190
Amen.
Amen.

39:17.315 --> 39:19.317
You may now kiss the bride.

39:22.904 --> 39:25.490
I now present Mr. And Mrs. Jack Morrison.

39:53.810 --> 39:56.805
Your husband's an excellent firefighter.

39:56.905 --> 39:59.349
Look after him for me, will you?

39:59.449 --> 40:01.309
I'll help him look after himself.

40:01.409 --> 40:03.486
Even better.

40:03.611 --> 40:05.613
Whoa.

40:07.991 --> 40:10.201
Teach Jack this stuff.

40:24.090 --> 40:28.211
All right, this next song
goes out to our newlyweds...

40:28.311 --> 40:30.589
...by special request.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.757
Uh, Frank, Don...

40:32.857 --> 40:36.303
I need you up here, uh,
immediately, please.

40:36.403 --> 40:38.313
Whoo!
Come on, guys.

40:42.817 --> 40:45.111
Come on, get up here, man!
Come on up here right now.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.490
Uh!

40:48.615 --> 40:49.783
Jack. Jack.

40:49.908 --> 40:51.109
Hey, Jack, get up here!

40:51.209 --> 40:53.111
Here we go.
No, no, you goin', you goin'.

40:53.211 --> 40:56.498
We'll be right back. Come on, buddy.

41:12.681 --> 41:16.309
Come here and sit down.
Join the club.

41:19.312 --> 41:22.190
Well, honey, we aren't
sitting far enough away.

42:28.298 --> 42:30.383
How you doin'?

42:32.093 --> 42:34.179
Captain Kennedy?
You the new rookie?

42:34.304 --> 42:35.797
Yeah.
Jack Morrison.

42:35.897 --> 42:37.507
Keith Perez.
Office is back there.

42:37.607 --> 42:41.186
Thanks. How you guys doin'?
What's up?

42:49.110 --> 42:51.396
Welcome to Engine 33.
Ok, all right.

42:51.496 --> 42:54.407
Thank you. Thank you, Captain.
All right. See ya.

42:58.286 --> 43:01.198
So, Keith, you Catholic?

43:01.298 --> 43:03.492
Yeah.

43:03.592 --> 43:06.912
Are you a virgin?
No, Father.

43:07.012 --> 43:09.998
So you think it's funny to
fornicate with loose women?

43:10.098 --> 43:12.884
Uh, no, no, not at all.

43:13.009 --> 43:16.388
Well, if you wanna have sex,
you should get married.

43:16.513 --> 43:18.799
I can't.
Why?

43:18.899 --> 43:23.053
It's not allowed.
What do you mean, it's not allowed?

43:23.153 --> 43:26.890
Well, the church doesn't allow two men
to get married, Father.

43:26.990 --> 43:28.983
Excuse me?

43:29.109 --> 43:31.194
I'm gay.

43:34.781 --> 43:36.942
Hey, how did you know that?
Yeah, we got him, baby!

43:37.042 --> 43:39.285
Ohh, really?
What?

43:39.411 --> 43:41.989
Did you tell him?

43:42.089 --> 43:43.581
What's up with that?

44:28.585 --> 44:31.087
God, it's like they're having a love affair.

44:32.380 --> 44:36.209
Girls. Green beers.
Here we go. Green beer.

44:36.309 --> 44:39.254
I'm good.
What?

44:39.354 --> 44:41.089
I'm good. I'm not drinking.
You can have it.

44:41.189 --> 44:43.758
Uh, Linda, it's Saint Paddy's.
It's Ok.

44:43.858 --> 44:46.186
I'm not gonna drink.
I'm just gonna grab a Coke from the bar.

44:46.311 --> 44:48.605
What, are you pregnant?

44:51.816 --> 44:53.985
What? You're kidding.

44:54.110 --> 44:55.604
Baby, I was gonna tell you later tonight...

44:55.704 --> 44:56.938
...but I wanted to surprise you.

44:57.038 --> 44:58.899
You're kidding? No!
Linda's pregnant.

44:58.999 --> 45:01.284
Linda's pregnant.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

45:01.409 --> 45:03.787
Turn down the music!
No more drinks for Linda.

45:03.912 --> 45:06.498
Doubles for Jack.
He's gonna be a father!

45:13.296 --> 45:15.090
Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!

45:15.215 --> 45:17.592
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack! Jack!

45:17.717 --> 45:20.504
Drinks are on Jack!
Drinks are on me!

45:20.604 --> 45:22.389
Drinks are on Jack!

45:28.019 --> 45:29.896
Uh-oh.

45:36.695 --> 45:39.489
Keep your money.
Save it for the baby.

45:39.614 --> 45:41.108
Hey, you know, Jack,
you can't have a baby...

45:41.208 --> 45:42.784
...without a shower.

45:48.081 --> 45:49.916
Great.

45:54.713 --> 45:56.498
Eighteen hundred block of Suffolk Street...

45:56.598 --> 45:58.208
...between Lafayette and Harris Place.

45:58.308 --> 45:59.801
Investigator reported smoke in the area.

46:04.014 --> 46:05.515
Charge the line!

46:08.601 --> 46:12.313
I'm getting too old for this shit.
You got that right.

46:16.985 --> 46:21.064
All right, let's see if
this fire's walking on us.

46:21.164 --> 46:22.607
Dennis, cut a hole in that roof.

46:22.707 --> 46:25.151
Ray, open up that skylight.
Yes, sir.

46:25.251 --> 46:29.906
Engine 15 to Engine 12,
uh, switch to Command channel.

46:30.006 --> 46:32.450
This is bullshit, man.
A two-story dumpster.

46:32.550 --> 46:34.002
Let it burn.

46:36.212 --> 46:38.331
This whole block is vacant.
Let it all burn.

46:38.431 --> 46:40.592
Stop your bitchin', little brother.

46:40.717 --> 46:42.886
We'll be back next week.

46:43.011 --> 46:44.296
Hey, Ray, I got an idea.

46:44.396 --> 46:47.807
Why don't you stop talking
and start doing...

46:50.810 --> 46:52.979
Ray?
Dennis!

46:53.104 --> 46:55.482
Aah!

46:55.607 --> 46:57.984
Dennis!

46:58.109 --> 46:59.694
Dennis!

46:59.819 --> 47:02.230
Man down!
Dennis!

47:02.330 --> 47:03.782
Man down!

47:04.616 --> 47:06.201
Tommy! Get the door!

47:10.705 --> 47:13.500
Mayday! Mayday!
Firefighter down!

47:13.708 --> 47:16.795
Mayday! Mayday!
Firefighter down!

47:16.920 --> 47:19.831
Come on! More line!
I need more line!

47:19.931 --> 47:22.501
Evacuate now!
Evacuate now!

47:22.601 --> 47:24.594
Activate the alarm!
Come on! Evac!

47:24.719 --> 47:28.014
Evac! It's comin' down!
I need more line!

47:34.396 --> 47:37.691
No! We can get him!
It's no good. It's no good!

47:37.816 --> 47:39.818
It's no good!

47:55.083 --> 47:58.586
Yep. Marlene keeps
askin' me to come home.

47:58.795 --> 48:02.207
She's cryin'. Thankin' God
I wasn't up on that roof.

48:02.307 --> 48:05.218
I just wanna go home
and hold my kids.

48:08.513 --> 48:11.099
This is it.
Let's line up, guys.

48:16.312 --> 48:20.266
I want you guys to take
as much time off as you need.

48:20.366 --> 48:22.110
Ok?

49:08.907 --> 49:12.786
Nothin' like this
has ever happened in this house before.

49:12.911 --> 49:16.990
It was the beams.
Never saw a roof go down so quick.

49:17.090 --> 49:19.084
It shouldn't have happened.

49:21.419 --> 49:23.246
What do you mean?

49:23.346 --> 49:26.216
He wasn't paying attention.

49:30.720 --> 49:34.591
What? Are you saying
it was Dennis's fault?

49:34.691 --> 49:37.185
Just shut up and wash
them dishes, rookie.

49:37.310 --> 49:40.980
You know, you're real good
at pickin' on rookies, man.

49:41.106 --> 49:43.108
Fuckin' asshole.

49:49.614 --> 49:52.701
Hey! Hey!

49:54.119 --> 49:57.288
What the hell's goin' on here?

49:57.414 --> 49:58.415
Huh?

50:01.418 --> 50:04.287
I come back from tellin'
a mother that her son is dead...

50:04.387 --> 50:06.707
...and this is goin' on in my house.

50:06.807 --> 50:08.800
In my house!

50:10.093 --> 50:13.046
We deal with this by sticking together.

50:13.146 --> 50:17.133
We take it.
We learn from it.

50:17.233 --> 50:19.135
And we get back on the goddamn truck.

50:19.235 --> 50:21.429
And that's how we honor Dennis!

50:21.529 --> 50:23.481
You got that?

50:25.608 --> 50:28.111
Anybody think of lowerin' the flag?

50:29.779 --> 50:31.489
Do it.

50:49.299 --> 50:50.834
Gathering our prayers together...

50:50.934 --> 50:54.004
...let us pray now in the way
that Jesus taught us.

50:54.104 --> 50:57.007
Our Father, who art in heaven...

50:57.107 --> 50:59.092
...hallowed be Thy name.

50:59.192 --> 51:01.553
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

51:01.653 --> 51:03.889
...on Earth as it is in heaven.

51:03.989 --> 51:06.391
Give us this day our daily bread...

51:06.491 --> 51:08.852
...and forgive us our trespasses...

51:08.952 --> 51:11.988
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us;

51:12.113 --> 51:17.569
...and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

51:17.669 --> 51:19.738
Eternal rest grant to him, O Lord.

51:19.838 --> 51:21.990
And let perpetual light shine upon him.

51:22.090 --> 51:24.409
May he rest in peace.

51:24.509 --> 51:28.789
May his soul and the souls
of the faithful departed...

51:28.889 --> 51:32.008
Detail, present arms!

51:35.220 --> 51:39.015
Color guard, present arms!

52:27.981 --> 52:31.643
Detail, order arms!

52:31.743 --> 52:34.904
Color guard, order arms!

53:19.699 --> 53:22.410
You don't think that might fall apart?

53:23.411 --> 53:25.413
Well, I hope not.

53:32.420 --> 53:34.881
So I'm thinking about changing jobs.

53:36.007 --> 53:37.300
What do you mean?

53:39.511 --> 53:42.889
Uh, goin' to search and rescue.
Move the truck.

53:44.391 --> 53:47.811
Does that mean you'd
be taking Dennis's place?

53:50.188 --> 53:53.191
Oh, no, you can't think that way.

53:55.902 --> 53:58.196
Well, would you?

54:12.711 --> 54:15.706
Hey, Cap, this stuff is great.

54:15.806 --> 54:18.591
That's my grandfather.

54:18.717 --> 54:20.711
And, uh, that's his helmet.

54:20.811 --> 54:24.798
These are my dad's.
That's him.

54:24.898 --> 54:27.968
One of these he got,
uh, after he passed away.

54:28.068 --> 54:30.303
This one.

54:30.403 --> 54:33.098
It's a Medal of Valor.
Yeah.

54:33.198 --> 54:34.816
So, what's goin' on?

54:35.817 --> 54:40.188
Oh, there's something I wanted
to talk to you about. Um...

54:40.288 --> 54:43.491
I was thinkin' about
transferring to the truck.

54:44.701 --> 54:47.362
Well, jeez, what the hell
you want to do that for?

54:47.462 --> 54:50.699
You're an engine man.
Truck's a whole different thing.

54:50.799 --> 54:54.586
You know... no water
between you and the fire.

54:54.711 --> 54:57.706
No hose line to guide you out
if you get lost in the smoke.

54:57.806 --> 54:59.883
It's not a good idea.

55:01.009 --> 55:03.211
Yeah, I know all that, Cap.

55:03.311 --> 55:05.680
I love being on the pipe.
It's just...

55:05.805 --> 55:08.183
It's just what?

55:09.601 --> 55:12.103
It's what I want, Mike.

55:21.404 --> 55:24.991
Well... you know, give it a try.

55:27.285 --> 55:29.287
But you gotta tell me somethin'.

55:29.412 --> 55:32.908
If this isn't for you, you tell me right away.

55:33.008 --> 55:34.793
You promise?

55:34.918 --> 55:37.212
Yes, sir.

55:42.801 --> 55:44.719
Oh, my God.

55:46.304 --> 55:48.890
Somebody!

55:52.436 --> 55:54.438
It's over there.

55:59.359 --> 56:01.945
Can you see me?

56:02.070 --> 56:05.157
Stay down! Stay down!
We're comin' to get you!

56:05.657 --> 56:08.861
I got this.
I'll try not to drop you.

56:08.961 --> 56:11.655
You're not afraid
of heights, are you, Jack?

56:11.755 --> 56:13.040
All right, let's gear up.

56:13.165 --> 56:14.491
Number ten this side, hold your position.

56:14.591 --> 56:17.044
Hold your position.
Do not attempt.

56:17.169 --> 56:19.755
Here, grab this.

56:22.758 --> 56:24.752
All right.
Check your rigs.

56:24.852 --> 56:26.470
Put that around your leg.

56:29.556 --> 56:30.966
Take your time.
Do your buckles.

56:31.066 --> 56:32.768
All right, tighten that.

56:34.561 --> 56:37.648
You got it?
Hey, Lenny, grab the rope.

56:37.773 --> 56:40.517
It's comin'.
Here's your end.

56:40.617 --> 56:42.736
Thanks.

56:42.861 --> 56:44.647
Help!

56:44.747 --> 56:48.742
All right, I got it goin' through.
You're cinched.

56:51.161 --> 56:54.657
Make sure that's tight.
You cool with this?

56:54.757 --> 56:56.659
Yeah.

56:56.759 --> 56:58.335
Stay down!

57:00.254 --> 57:02.256
You ready?

57:03.840 --> 57:05.842
All right, hold on, Jack.

57:05.968 --> 57:10.256
Ladder 49 to Command.
We got a man comin' over the top.

57:10.356 --> 57:11.848
All right, Tommy, nice and easy.

57:11.974 --> 57:14.843
Oh, God, it's hot!

57:14.943 --> 57:17.596
Try not to look down, Jack.

57:17.696 --> 57:20.266
Thanks, Lenny.

57:20.366 --> 57:21.808
You got it, man.

57:21.908 --> 57:24.102
Lenny!
All right, give me a foot.

57:24.202 --> 57:26.446
Nice and easy, guys.
No race.

57:29.950 --> 57:32.160
All right, Tommy, let it down.

57:33.453 --> 57:35.364
All right, hold on, Jack.

57:35.464 --> 57:38.367
How much further?
About 25 feet.

57:38.467 --> 57:41.336
25 feet, Tommy.

57:41.461 --> 57:43.839
Oh, God! Oh!

57:43.964 --> 57:47.050
We got you, Jack.
You're good.

57:47.759 --> 57:50.637
Come on. Down!

57:55.475 --> 57:57.436
Keep it comin'.

57:57.561 --> 58:00.272
Uh, yeah, Bob, we're on
the scene in chopper seven.

58:03.567 --> 58:06.812
Hey! Hey! I'm here!

58:06.912 --> 58:09.064
Down! Down!

58:09.164 --> 58:11.241
You almost there?

58:11.366 --> 58:13.744
About 15 feet!

58:13.869 --> 58:15.612
Hey! Hey, I'm here!

58:15.712 --> 58:17.539
I'm coming for you.
Just wait!

58:17.664 --> 58:18.540
Down!

58:18.665 --> 58:20.868
All right, keep it comin'!

58:20.968 --> 58:22.453
Almost!

58:22.553 --> 58:24.338
We've got a burning building...

58:24.463 --> 58:26.665
...in downtown on Calvert Street.

58:26.765 --> 58:29.051
A lot of flames, a lot of smoke.

58:29.176 --> 58:30.461
I'm right here!

58:30.561 --> 58:32.755
Down! Down a few more feet!

58:32.855 --> 58:34.548
No, wait! Wait!

58:34.648 --> 58:37.092
You stay there, all right?
Wait. Wait till I'm set!

58:37.192 --> 58:39.144
Just wait till I'm set.

58:39.269 --> 58:41.055
Ok, stop! Stop!

58:41.155 --> 58:42.723
All right, ho, ho, ho, ho!

58:42.823 --> 58:45.442
Your eyes start to burn
and the heat from the flames...

58:45.567 --> 58:47.144
Get over!

58:47.244 --> 58:49.071
Just wait! Just wait!

58:52.950 --> 58:53.951
Hold it, Tommy!
Hold it!

58:54.868 --> 58:55.953
Oh, there they go!

58:58.664 --> 59:00.658
Calm down! Calm down!

59:00.758 --> 59:02.751
Calm down or you'll kill us!
Oh, God.

59:02.876 --> 59:04.336
I swear to God I'll drop you.

59:07.965 --> 59:10.000
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Close your eyes.

59:10.100 --> 59:11.502
Close your eyes.
Put your head against me.

59:11.602 --> 59:12.794
Ok, Ok.
All right?

59:12.894 --> 59:14.463
I'm gonna push off this window.

59:14.563 --> 59:16.465
It's gonna be Ok.
You just stay calm, Ok?

59:16.565 --> 59:18.058
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Stay calm.

59:20.352 --> 59:23.855
Agh, jeez! Jeez!
Oh, God.

59:38.870 --> 59:41.323
Oh, he shatters the glass!

59:41.423 --> 59:44.660
They're inside now.
We're gonna try and get this guy's name.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.670
Let's go, come on!

59:48.463 --> 59:50.465
Oh, God.
You got him?

59:53.051 --> 59:53.844
Is he in?

59:53.969 --> 59:56.346
Give him some slack.

59:56.471 --> 59:57.639
He's in.

59:57.764 --> 59:59.049
Let's get in closer, Jerry.

59:59.149 --> 01:00:00.350
See if we can get in closer for a look.

01:00:01.476 --> 01:00:03.854
He's off-line.

01:00:18.535 --> 01:00:20.245
Hon?

01:00:22.247 --> 01:00:23.749
Whoa, hey.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.453
Hello.

01:00:27.553 --> 01:00:29.663
Hey, baby.
How was your shift?

01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:31.673
Hi, baby.
It was great.

01:00:32.758 --> 01:00:35.636
Been drinking?

01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:39.139
Yes, I had a few drinks with the boys.

01:00:41.642 --> 01:00:43.644
What's the matter?

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:47.439
I saw you on the news, Jack.

01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:01.245
Linda, what is wrong?

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:05.749
I saw you on the news, Jack.
Dangling from a rope!

01:01:05.874 --> 01:01:08.452
How could you tell me
that it's not dangerous?

01:01:08.552 --> 01:01:10.913
I didn't say it wasn't dangerous.
When we talked about it...

01:01:11.013 --> 01:01:12.548
I asked you,
and you said it wasn't dangerous.

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:14.667
I said it wasn't any more dangerous
than being on the engine.

01:01:14.767 --> 01:01:16.460
I never said it wasn't dangerous.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.055
Do you see me right now?
Do you?

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.560
'Cause this isn't just about us.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:30.357
Have you thought about that?

01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:37.948
Don't.

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:40.692
Don't.

01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:42.744
I'm sorry.
I'm scared.

01:01:42.869 --> 01:01:45.864
I can't sleep.
I keep having that dream...

01:01:45.964 --> 01:01:52.045
...about the red car turning up in front of
the house when you don't come home.

01:01:52.838 --> 01:01:54.756
I'm sorry.
Don't.

01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:04.266
I saved that man today.

01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:25.245
Did I miss it?
They just took her to the delivery room.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.372
Is she Ok?
She's fine.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.442
Aah! Aah!

01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:09.716
Hey, Chief.

01:04:09.816 --> 01:04:11.844
Yeah, Jack, go ahead.

01:04:11.944 --> 01:04:13.804
Chief, it's getting pretty unstable in here.

01:04:13.904 --> 01:04:16.273
I got all sorts of shit
falling down around me.

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:22.062
I understand.
Now, Jack, listen up.

01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:23.447
Ok.

01:04:23.572 --> 01:04:26.366
Can you identify anything around you?

01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:36.952
There's a sliding access door to my left.

01:04:37.052 --> 01:04:39.046
But I can't get to it.
There's too much debris.

01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:43.459
Chief, the problem is every floor
eight through eleven are identical.

01:04:43.559 --> 01:04:48.756
Well, look, if the collapse happened here,
and he's anywhere near this control room...

01:04:48.856 --> 01:04:50.349
...if we can get him in here,
it could buy us some time.

01:04:50.474 --> 01:04:53.302
My best guess is that he's
right about here in this area.

01:04:53.402 --> 01:04:55.804
And if he can break through this wall
and get into the control room...

01:04:55.904 --> 01:04:58.349
Right, right. And if my guys
can get through the debris...

01:04:58.449 --> 01:05:01.352
...they can meet here,
and go down the back stairwell.

01:05:01.452 --> 01:05:03.445
Might work, Chief.

01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:06.357
Ok, now, look, Jack,
this is very important.

01:05:06.457 --> 01:05:09.902
Right behind you there's a wall.
Behind that wall is a control room. Ok?

01:05:10.002 --> 01:05:12.655
If we can break through that wall,
we can buy some time.

01:05:12.755 --> 01:05:14.665
Can you do that?

01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:17.751
I'll give it a shot.

01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:22.957
Where do you need us, Chief?

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:25.000
I need two men up there on eight,
helping Ladder 17.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.844
And I need a two-and-a-half-inch
supply line right now up on eight.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.547
Go.
Copy that, Chief.

01:05:29.647 --> 01:05:32.967
Ladder 49,
I need a situation report.

01:05:33.067 --> 01:05:36.512
The progress is that
we're working on it, Chief.

01:05:36.612 --> 01:05:38.264
I need another blade!

01:05:38.364 --> 01:05:40.148
Sir, there's no way to tell.
It's tough.

01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:42.851
All hands are working.
Just keep at it.

01:05:42.951 --> 01:05:43.944
Copy. Go.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:46.146
Just give me another saw.
We need a saw!

01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:47.864
Get me a saw!

01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:37.641
Gotta make a wish first.

01:07:37.766 --> 01:07:39.468
I wish for a Barbie car.

01:07:39.568 --> 01:07:41.937
No, you're not supposed
to say it out loud.

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:44.064
But won't I get it now?

01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:48.644
Blow out the candles, baby.
We'll open your presents in a minute.

01:07:48.744 --> 01:07:50.737
Yay, Katie!

01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:53.649
Happy birthday.

01:07:53.749 --> 01:07:54.950
Sorry I'm late.

01:07:55.075 --> 01:07:57.152
This is for the birthday girl.
This is for Nicky.

01:07:57.252 --> 01:07:58.537
You shouldn't have.

01:07:58.662 --> 01:08:00.447
I didn't want him to be jealous, you know.
Thank you.

01:08:00.547 --> 01:08:01.665
Hey, happy birthday.

01:08:07.963 --> 01:08:09.673
What?
You want a hot dog?

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:12.342
You want a burger, no?

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.444
Dog-pile on Daddy.

01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:32.854
Cute.

01:08:32.955 --> 01:08:34.948
Very cute.
Cute?

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:37.158
You know what I love about this place?

01:08:37.743 --> 01:08:43.457
Sitting here at night, watching
the romantic lights of the oil refineries.

01:08:44.249 --> 01:08:45.868
Beauty and the Beast is a hell of a book.

01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:49.246
It's good. I haven't read it before.
Put the kids to sleep.

01:08:49.345 --> 01:08:52.957
Good night.
You ever consider baby-sitting full time?

01:08:53.058 --> 01:08:55.919
What do you think I do at the firehouse?

01:08:56.019 --> 01:08:57.136
Good night.
Good night.

01:08:57.261 --> 01:08:58.971
Night, Mike. Thanks.
You're welcome.

01:09:02.475 --> 01:09:05.770
I think we're alone now.

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:12.019
You all right with that?
Yep.

01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:14.313
Hon, shouldn't you have left by now?

01:09:14.412 --> 01:09:16.240
Yeah, I can't find my keys.
You seen 'em?

01:09:16.365 --> 01:09:18.651
Yeah, they're by the door,
where you left them.

01:09:18.751 --> 01:09:21.536
Where I left them?
I left them there?

01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:23.656
Oh, hey, Dad?
Yeah.

01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:25.908
Can we take PJ to the game on Saturday?

01:09:26.008 --> 01:09:28.452
Game on Saturday?
Yeah, definitely.

01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:31.046
If it's Ok with his parents, yeah.

01:09:32.256 --> 01:09:33.749
Did you forget?

01:09:33.849 --> 01:09:35.551
No, the guys planned a fishing trip.

01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:38.462
I completely forgot.
I'll take him.

01:09:38.562 --> 01:09:40.555
No, no, I want to.
It's fine.

01:09:48.772 --> 01:09:51.358
What is it?
It's a tree.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.739
Yeah, it is a tree, isn't it?
It's pretty.

01:09:57.864 --> 01:09:59.741
You want to put it up on the fridge?

01:09:59.866 --> 01:10:01.652
Show it to your mama.
Love you guys.

01:10:01.752 --> 01:10:03.820
See ya tomorrow.
Bye, hon.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.365
All right, buddy, I'm off.
Ok.

01:10:06.465 --> 01:10:08.867
What's the matter? Need tightening?
Yeah, I think so.

01:10:08.967 --> 01:10:12.963
All right, well, I'll take a look at it
when I get back from work.

01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:36.353
Engine 33, Engine 13...

01:10:36.453 --> 01:10:38.739
Truck 49, Truck 16,
Battalion Chief six...

01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:41.358
...respond to box alarm 33-4
for alarm bell sounding...

01:10:41.458 --> 01:10:44.445
...at the BG & E Power Plant
on Broening Highway.

01:10:44.545 --> 01:10:47.948
Units on box alarm 33-4,
alarm system is active...

01:10:48.048 --> 01:10:50.250
...with possible steam leaks
and pipe ruptures.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.836
Units are to exercise extreme caution.

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:56.548
They say the parents got to dress up.
I'm not gonna do it like last year...

01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:58.842
...where I go looking like a fool,
'cause you got nothin' on.

01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:01.045
Are you dressin' up?
What do you think?

01:11:01.145 --> 01:11:03.138
Yeah, you better.

01:11:40.676 --> 01:11:41.843
That can't be good.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.051
Tommy, check out downstairs.

01:11:49.151 --> 01:11:50.561
All right.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.962
Ok, let's go. Come on.
Come on, let's go!

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:38.851
Cap, let's find Tommy
and get the hell outta here.

01:12:38.951 --> 01:12:42.062
Hey! Over here!
I'm coming!

01:12:42.162 --> 01:12:45.149
Tommy!
Hey, Jack.

01:12:45.249 --> 01:12:47.651
Did you find anyone?
No, nobody.

01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:50.245
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:55.042
Tommy!

01:13:10.265 --> 01:13:12.468
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

01:13:12.568 --> 01:13:15.354
You're going in the chopper,
Tommy. Taking you to Gilford.

01:13:20.776 --> 01:13:24.355
We got you, partner.
You're gonna be all right.

01:13:24.455 --> 01:13:29.159
Tommy, we're puttin' you on the chopper
and taking you to Gilford!

01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:32.863
Oh, shit.

01:13:32.963 --> 01:13:35.165
Ok, let's go!

01:13:44.049 --> 01:13:46.260
Ok, back off, guys.

01:14:06.071 --> 01:14:08.865
How were they?
Angels.

01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:14.947
What's wrong?

01:14:15.047 --> 01:14:17.658
I hurt myself at work.

01:14:17.758 --> 01:14:19.701
You Ok?

01:14:19.801 --> 01:14:21.962
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:25.549
We'll be up in a second.

01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:28.752
Come on, Nicky.
Head upstairs and brush your teeth.

01:14:28.852 --> 01:14:31.471
Hey, Nick, did you brush your teeth?

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:42.441
What's going on? You Ok?

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:50.949
No fever.
You got a little tummy ache?

01:14:52.576 --> 01:14:55.537
Hey, Dad?
Yeah.

01:14:55.662 --> 01:14:59.166
Does steam really melt your face away?

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:03.787
Who told you that?
Joey Costo.

01:15:03.887 --> 01:15:09.051
He said that Alex's dad's face
melted away 'cause of steam.

01:15:11.136 --> 01:15:14.139
Uh, yeah, well, steam can burn your skin.

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.143
But new skin grows back in its place.

01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:23.148
Tommy's face got burned,
but his skin will grow back.

01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:29.446
Does it hurt?

01:15:32.449 --> 01:15:34.451
Yeah, when it happens.

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:39.873
I don't want you getting hurt anymore, Dad.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.045
Well, we're trained not to get hurt, Nick.

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:49.708
And long before you were
even born, I was trainin'.

01:15:49.808 --> 01:15:53.254
But, uh, you know,
sometimes things do go wrong...

01:15:53.354 --> 01:15:56.298
...like with me and Alex's dad.

01:15:56.398 --> 01:16:00.143
But, you know, we're not afraid,
because we do it to save people.

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:02.721
You know, it's worth it
to save people, isn't it?

01:16:02.821 --> 01:16:04.557
Yeah.
And you know, if things do go wrong...

01:16:04.657 --> 01:16:07.768
I got your uncle Mike and all
my friends at the firehouse.

01:16:07.868 --> 01:16:10.237
You know they'd never let
anything happen to me.

01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:12.239
Yeah.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.694
Can you do me a favor?
Mm-hmm.

01:16:17.794 --> 01:16:22.950
You tell Joey Costo that Alex's dad
got burned trying to save people...

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:25.786
...and that he's gonna be Ok.

01:16:25.886 --> 01:16:28.463
Will you do that for me?

01:16:36.638 --> 01:16:38.757
Hi. Can I help you?
Yeah, Tommy Drake's room.

01:16:38.857 --> 01:16:40.976
Room five, right down there.

01:17:10.464 --> 01:17:12.049
You're not gonna go in?

01:17:12.174 --> 01:17:15.135
There was a nurse inside, and I thought
maybe I oughta come back another time.

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:20.057
No, it's fine. You can go in now.
She's almost done with his dressing.

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:28.015
Oh, excuse me.

01:17:28.115 --> 01:17:29.516
How's he doing?

01:17:29.616 --> 01:17:31.852
We have him on medication
to control the pain.

01:17:31.952 --> 01:17:35.064
He's over the worst.
Ok.

01:17:35.164 --> 01:17:39.076
We'll leave you alone for a few minutes.
Thank you.

01:17:41.453 --> 01:17:43.822
Jack, how are you, man?

01:17:43.922 --> 01:17:46.875
I'm doing fine, buddy.
How are you doin'?

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.963
Doctor says I'm gonna make it.
Yeah.

01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:56.176
You know what I have?
They put dead men's skin on me.

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:08.855
Marlene wants to bring the kids by...

01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:12.568
...but I don't want her to.

01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:17.072
Hey. Of course she wants to bring the kids.
They wanna see you.

01:18:18.448 --> 01:18:20.450
I'm scared, Jack.

01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:27.541
I was their hero, you know?
I was their hero.

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:30.452
Kids, they don't forget things like this.

01:18:30.552 --> 01:18:34.047
I don't know, man. Maybe it would've been
best if I just didn't make it. You know, I...

01:18:34.172 --> 01:18:39.052
Hey. Don't say that.
Don't say that.

01:18:42.347 --> 01:18:46.844
Hey, Tommy, you know, this is one of
the best burn centers in the country.

01:18:46.944 --> 01:18:49.146
You know?

01:18:49.271 --> 01:18:53.150
I don't think your kids loved
you 'cause of your looks.

01:18:54.151 --> 01:18:56.153
They miss their dad.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.950
I don't know.

01:19:08.665 --> 01:19:10.667
How did he look?

01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:14.338
Good.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:21.545
Is he in a lot of pain?

01:19:21.645 --> 01:19:26.467
They're medicating him,
Linda, so, you know...

01:19:26.567 --> 01:19:29.144
I'd like to go see him.

01:19:32.064 --> 01:19:34.149
Why?

01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:36.568
Because he's our friend.

01:19:37.236 --> 01:19:39.071
Do what you want.

01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:41.657
Are you telling me
you don't want me to go?

01:19:42.366 --> 01:19:45.903
No, I don't want you to go.
Why?

01:19:46.003 --> 01:19:47.947
'Cause you're gonna see him,
and you're gonna get freaked out.

01:19:48.047 --> 01:19:50.866
It's gonna be more for you to worry about.

01:19:50.966 --> 01:19:55.162
More for me to worry about
or more for you to worry about, Jack?

01:19:55.262 --> 01:19:57.122
Linda, don't tell me you don't worry.

01:19:57.222 --> 01:20:00.050
You're always talkin' about being honest.
Be honest.

01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:05.264
Are you trying to pick a fight?
I'm not trying to pick a damn fight.

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.647
I'll tell you the job, good ones.

01:20:13.772 --> 01:20:15.849
A big office, secretary.

01:20:15.949 --> 01:20:18.894
Too much paperwork, though.

01:20:18.994 --> 01:20:21.355
Oh, you have got to cheer up.

01:20:21.455 --> 01:20:23.857
Hey, Jack, stop your pouting.
Everybody's got to work Christmas.

01:20:23.957 --> 01:20:25.951
Ho-ho-ho!

01:20:26.076 --> 01:20:27.444
Ah, here's trouble.
Ho-ho-ho!

01:20:27.544 --> 01:20:30.247
Ho! Ho-ho!

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:37.170
77 and a Sea Breeze, dear?

01:20:38.463 --> 01:20:41.341
Get it? 'Deer.'

01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:49.258
What's eating you?

01:20:49.358 --> 01:20:52.644
Hey, Santa, who is this?
That's not Mrs. Claus.

01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:57.850
'Cause I met Mrs. Claus,
and that is definitely not her.

01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:02.154
Yeah, well, maybe I have to come
slide down your chimney tonight.

01:21:07.451 --> 01:21:09.745
What the hell are you doin'?

01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:18.954
I'm Ok. I'm Ok.

01:21:19.054 --> 01:21:20.289
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:21:20.389 --> 01:21:22.249
He had it comin'.
I'm gonna kick his ass!

01:21:22.349 --> 01:21:25.252
This isn't about Lenny.
What's wrong with you?

01:21:25.352 --> 01:21:27.346
Huh?
Nothing.

01:21:32.976 --> 01:21:36.146
We gotta talk. Come on,
let's get some coffee.

01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:38.649
I kicked his ass, didn't I?
Yeah, you did.

01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:46.657
You want anything else?
No, thank you.

01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:54.373
Did we calm down?

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:06.760
So, you still love the job like you used to?

01:22:12.849 --> 01:22:14.260
Look, you've been through a lot.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.554
What can I say? I mean,
you lost your best friend...

01:22:16.654 --> 01:22:19.439
...you've been through some bad fires.

01:22:20.566 --> 01:22:23.060
You seen a lot of buddies hurt.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.862
It festers. It does.

01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:29.449
How are Linda and the kids?

01:22:32.244 --> 01:22:34.947
You know, it's tough.

01:22:35.047 --> 01:22:36.990
Yeah, it is tough.
See, I never had that problem...

01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:39.042
...because when I was married...

01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:41.119
...my wife hated me being a firefighter.

01:22:41.219 --> 01:22:44.047
We were divorced nine months later.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.843
But you're different.
You're a good father.

01:22:47.968 --> 01:22:51.346
You worry.
But you should worry.

01:22:53.056 --> 01:22:55.759
You know, maybe it's time
for a change of scenery.

01:22:55.859 --> 01:22:57.936
Yeah, what does that mean?

01:22:59.646 --> 01:23:01.890
Well... I was thinking...

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:04.560
...there's this, uh, job down at headquarters.

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:09.448
There's this aide's position
that I can put your name in for.

01:23:10.574 --> 01:23:13.485
Are you saying I need to
get out of the firehouse?

01:23:13.585 --> 01:23:16.747
Well, I'm saying that
you should ask yourself that question.

01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:19.658
Maybe go home, talk to Linda.

01:23:19.758 --> 01:23:22.544
You know, be honest with yourself.

01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:26.457
There's nothing wrong with moving on.

01:23:26.557 --> 01:23:28.675
I did it.

01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:32.971
So, what did he say?

01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:37.059
Mike offered to take me
with him as an aide.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.937
What does that mean for us?

01:23:41.772 --> 01:23:45.059
Well, I'll be home nights,
unless they call me in.

01:23:45.159 --> 01:23:49.154
And, uh, 70 cents an hour increase in pay.

01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:54.243
No fighting fire.

01:23:57.246 --> 01:23:59.665
Is that what you want?

01:24:05.337 --> 01:24:09.458
I don't know.
Um... You know?

01:24:09.558 --> 01:24:15.088
Things have been... so crazy lately and...

01:24:15.188 --> 01:24:19.260
You know, the kids are scared,
and I see you upset...

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.772
...and, uh, you know, it's my fault.

01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:28.151
So this is about me
and the kids again, is it?

01:24:47.754 --> 01:24:51.758
Look, we've been married ten years.

01:24:52.843 --> 01:24:56.463
And what you do is hard for me sometimes.

01:24:56.563 --> 01:24:58.966
And I do get scared.

01:24:59.066 --> 01:25:01.059
But I deal with it.

01:25:02.352 --> 01:25:04.646
'Cause I'm proud of you, baby.

01:25:16.742 --> 01:25:19.036
You know, Mike asked me tonight...

01:25:19.161 --> 01:25:22.247
...if I still love the job the way I did.

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:30.255
And, for the first time in my life,
I didn't know what to say.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.842
...from midnight
through the current hour...

01:25:33.967 --> 01:25:35.961
...how this has been progressing
on into our area.

01:25:36.061 --> 01:25:38.347
And you can see just at the midnight hour...

01:25:38.472 --> 01:25:41.550
...in and around the immediate
Baltimore metro area...

01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:43.344
...we already have winter storm warnings...

01:25:43.444 --> 01:25:46.772
Man, we're gonna get six calls tonight.
Doubt it.

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:50.768
They're gonna bullshit all night,
you're gonna tell me.

01:25:50.868 --> 01:25:52.686
Mm, tell you...

01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:56.315
Firebox 13-13.
Please respond, 0-1-Charlie-1.

01:25:56.415 --> 01:25:59.576
Engine 13, Engine 52,
Engine 8 and 6...

01:27:09.146 --> 01:27:10.939
Lenny! Lenny!

01:27:11.064 --> 01:27:13.559
You'll ladder up to the third floor.

01:27:13.659 --> 01:27:16.445
I got it! I got it! Go!

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.950
Over here!

01:27:22.075 --> 01:27:24.361
What's going on?
It's frozen!

01:27:24.461 --> 01:27:26.455
Our pipe's running low.

01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:29.041
Don! Don!

01:27:29.166 --> 01:27:31.160
We got a frozen plug.
We gotta pump it to 'em.

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.836
Comin' at ya.

01:27:34.463 --> 01:27:35.456
You Ok?
Yes.

01:27:35.556 --> 01:27:38.550
How old are you, son?
Nine.

01:27:38.675 --> 01:27:41.503
Hey, buddy, where's your mom and dad?
Shopping.

01:27:41.603 --> 01:27:43.756
They leave you alone?

01:27:43.856 --> 01:27:45.974
I... I was with Jenny.

01:27:46.767 --> 01:27:48.761
Who's Jenny?

01:27:48.861 --> 01:27:51.563
My cousin.
She was baby-sitting.

01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:54.441
Where do you live?
Which apartment? Show me.

01:27:57.569 --> 01:27:59.154
Top one?

01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:34.056
Hello? Fire Department!

01:28:34.156 --> 01:28:36.149
Hello!

01:28:51.373 --> 01:28:53.375
Hello!

01:28:54.668 --> 01:28:56.670
Fire Department!

01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:09.558
Anybody hear me?
Fire Department!

01:29:19.943 --> 01:29:21.737
Hello!

01:29:22.237 --> 01:29:25.365
Anybody there? Hello!

01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:45.761
Hello? Hello!

01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:00.043
Help!

01:31:00.168 --> 01:31:02.546
Help!

01:31:05.465 --> 01:31:08.635
Help! Can anybody hear me?

01:31:12.556 --> 01:31:15.267
Jack!
Help!

01:31:19.354 --> 01:31:20.347
Hey!

01:31:20.447 --> 01:31:22.558
Hey!

01:31:22.658 --> 01:31:25.018
Right here!
Jack!

01:31:25.118 --> 01:31:26.562
Hey, we're over here!

01:31:26.662 --> 01:31:30.574
Jack!
Right here, right here!

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.662
Grab her legs! Let's go!

01:31:49.843 --> 01:31:51.470
Got her?

01:32:00.562 --> 01:32:02.806
All the way down, all the way down.

01:32:02.906 --> 01:32:05.275
All the way down.
Go, go, go, go.

01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:14.743
One, two, three, four, five.

01:32:14.868 --> 01:32:19.039
Go. One, two, three, four, five.

01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:23.661
Go. One, two, three, four, five.

01:32:23.761 --> 01:32:25.246
Come on, breathe.

01:32:25.346 --> 01:32:28.457
One, two, three, four, five.

01:32:28.557 --> 01:32:32.636
Go. One, two, three, four, five.

01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:34.555
Go.

01:32:40.435 --> 01:32:42.437
I got somethin'!

01:32:52.072 --> 01:32:54.858
Good job.
Thank you.

01:32:54.958 --> 01:32:56.868
Nice work, guys.

01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:00.864
Jack, you're bleeding.
Huh?

01:33:00.964 --> 01:33:02.950
You're bleeding.
Get it treated.

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:05.244
Your shift's over.
Merry Christmas.

01:33:05.344 --> 01:33:06.962
Lenny!

01:34:28.043 --> 01:34:30.704
On the night of Christmas Eve,
Baltimore firefighters...

01:34:30.804 --> 01:34:33.249
Jack Morrison and Leonard Richter...

01:34:33.349 --> 01:34:35.459
...entered a blazing apartment block...

01:34:35.559 --> 01:34:38.462
...despite enormous danger to themselves...

01:34:38.562 --> 01:34:40.756
...and saved a young girl's life.

01:34:40.856 --> 01:34:42.849
Now, normally I'd present the medals...

01:34:42.975 --> 01:34:45.553
...but today we have someone
more important...

01:34:45.653 --> 01:34:48.355
...and certainly better looking:
Jenny Buckley.

01:34:54.069 --> 01:34:55.946
Firefighter Jack Morrison.

01:35:11.253 --> 01:35:13.463
Congratulations, Jack.
Thank you, sir.

01:35:14.965 --> 01:35:16.758
Thank you.

01:35:18.844 --> 01:35:20.637
You're welcome.

01:35:29.146 --> 01:35:32.649
Firefighter Leonard Richter.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.145
Come on. Come on!

01:36:27.371 --> 01:36:28.747
Aah!

01:36:36.838 --> 01:36:38.840
We're through!
Come on, let's go!

01:36:38.966 --> 01:36:40.759
Give me your hand.

01:36:53.564 --> 01:36:56.567
Come on, this way!
Let's go!

01:37:00.654 --> 01:37:03.740
We got a rebar! Come on!

01:37:05.367 --> 01:37:07.452
Come on!
We need equipment up here!

01:37:21.049 --> 01:37:24.052
All units report to the 11th floor now.

01:37:50.245 --> 01:37:52.873
Jack. It's me, Jack.

01:37:55.459 --> 01:37:57.461
Chief, I'm through the wall.

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.254
Coming down!

01:38:07.354 --> 01:38:10.349
Oh, God!
Get down!

01:38:14.937 --> 01:38:18.774
Is everybody all right?
Ladder 49 to Command.

01:38:20.275 --> 01:38:22.561
We're through the debris.

01:38:22.661 --> 01:38:24.521
And conditions deteriorating rapidly!

01:38:24.621 --> 01:38:26.899
Ladder 49, there's a control room
straight ahead.

01:38:26.999 --> 01:38:29.151
Jack's in there.
You keep going. Just keep going.

01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:31.370
Jack, they're on their way.

01:38:39.836 --> 01:38:41.455
Command, stand by.
I see a door.

01:38:41.555 --> 01:38:43.958
I see a door!

01:38:44.058 --> 01:38:45.751
Jack, they're getting close.

01:38:45.851 --> 01:38:48.637
You just hang on there, Jack.
Just hang on.

01:38:56.144 --> 01:38:59.147
Come on, guys!
There's the door.

01:38:59.273 --> 01:39:00.599
Jack, hold on!
We're right here!

01:39:00.699 --> 01:39:02.651
Open it up!
Hold on, Jack!

01:39:07.739 --> 01:39:09.575
Open the door!
Come on, let's go!

01:39:20.043 --> 01:39:22.337
Close it! Close it!

01:39:25.674 --> 01:39:27.793
Ladder 49 to Command!

01:39:27.893 --> 01:39:30.137
The room is blast over.
We can't get in!

01:39:30.262 --> 01:39:31.713
It's fully engulfed, Chief!

01:39:31.813 --> 01:39:33.966
We're attempting to find
another way to get to Jack!

01:39:34.066 --> 01:39:36.143
We have a lot of falling debris here.

01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:38.854
We have falling debris!
We need help.

01:40:02.669 --> 01:40:05.047
Jack, talk to me.

01:40:05.172 --> 01:40:07.166
Jack, talk to me.

01:40:07.266 --> 01:40:09.960
Mike, it's too late.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:14.139
Listen to me.
It's no good.

01:40:15.557 --> 01:40:17.559
Pull 'em out.

01:40:32.157 --> 01:40:34.159
Mike...

01:40:37.037 --> 01:40:39.990
...tell Linda I love her...

01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:43.252
...that I loved her from the second I saw her.

01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:47.172
Do you hear me?

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.842
Yeah, I hear you.

01:40:55.264 --> 01:40:58.350
Promise to take care of my kids.

01:41:00.435 --> 01:41:04.265
Tell them that I'm always with them.

01:41:04.365 --> 01:41:06.441
You tell... you tell them that.

01:41:06.567 --> 01:41:08.569
You hear me?

01:41:17.536 --> 01:41:19.955
I will.

01:41:41.351 --> 01:41:46.064
Command to all units.
Evacuate the building immediately.

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.412
Truck 16 checking in here, Chief.

01:42:08.512 --> 01:42:10.339
Uh, all units reporting clear.

01:42:10.464 --> 01:42:13.342
The building's clear.
We're all out.

01:42:13.467 --> 01:42:15.969
Copy that.

01:43:53.859 --> 01:43:56.145
It's never an easy thing...

01:43:56.245 --> 01:43:58.947
...saying goodbye to a brother firefighter.

01:43:59.072 --> 01:44:00.949
It's not.

01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:04.945
And this time particularly
is difficult for me...

01:44:05.045 --> 01:44:08.449
...because I watched Jack grow into a...

01:44:08.549 --> 01:44:13.620
...well, into one of the finest
firefighters I've ever known.

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:18.250
He joined this department
because he wanted to help people.

01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:21.253
Who knows how many homes are
still standing because Jack was there...

01:44:21.353 --> 01:44:24.056
...or how many lives were spared?

01:44:27.059 --> 01:44:29.561
He gave his life for that cause.

01:44:31.647 --> 01:44:34.066
We'll never forget you, Jack.

01:44:34.942 --> 01:44:37.945
And we're better for having known you.

01:44:42.366 --> 01:44:44.451
But I make you this one promise:

01:44:44.576 --> 01:44:47.821
Tomorrow, when that bell rings...

01:44:47.921 --> 01:44:50.540
...we will be back on the truck...

01:44:50.666 --> 01:44:53.543
...because you were
the bravest of the brave.

01:44:54.753 --> 01:44:57.047
People are always asking me...

01:44:57.172 --> 01:45:00.342
...how is it that firefighters
run into a burning building...

01:45:00.467 --> 01:45:02.962
...when everyone else is running out?

01:45:03.062 --> 01:45:06.048
Well, Jack, you answered that question...

01:45:06.148 --> 01:45:08.551
...by saving another man's life.

01:45:08.651 --> 01:45:11.562
Your courage is the answer.

01:45:16.775 --> 01:45:19.861
And today we will be as brave as you...

01:45:21.446 --> 01:45:26.243
...by not mourning you,
but by celebrating your life.

01:45:26.368 --> 01:45:29.538
So I'd like everyone to stand up
and celebrate the life...

01:45:29.663 --> 01:45:31.540
...of Jack Morrison.

01:45:39.965 --> 01:45:41.967
Thank you.
