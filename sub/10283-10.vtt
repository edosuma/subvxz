WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.773
Previously on ER:

00:05.773 --> 00:07.708
I'm not saying he's not
a great guy,

00:07.708 --> 00:08.776
he is, but do you know him?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.178
Under what
circumstances

00:10.178 --> 00:12.513
would a prisoner
be transferred

00:12.513 --> 00:14.115
from one state
to another?

00:14.115 --> 00:15.316
Your ex?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.550
I'm going to be
the new ER chief.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.651
You know,
when I withdrew my name

00:17.651 --> 00:19.353
I was hoping
they'd pick you.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.621
I'm going to make sure
you work harder

00:20.621 --> 00:22.423
than any other
volunteer up in here.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.825
So no more going out
for donuts and chasing skirts.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.827
Stay in the game, K.J.
Otherwise, they win.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.028
Would you like to...?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.165
LUKA:
Here's to discretion.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.232
Propriety.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.334
Maturity.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.735
Well...

00:40.774 --> 00:43.644
( whistling "Jingle Bells" )

00:43.644 --> 00:45.079
How's it going, Louie?

00:45.079 --> 00:47.281
I got two more sidewalks
to clear

00:47.281 --> 00:51.219
and a Furbie doll
to find.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.753
Hey, Louie.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.524
No way.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.359
Merry Christmas,
buddy.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.227
Thank you.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.461
Hey, Dr. Kovac.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.463
How's your mom doing?

01:02.463 --> 01:04.197
One more treatment,
then she's out.

01:04.197 --> 01:08.569
Well, maybe this
will cheer her up.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.770
Thank you.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.210
Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho! Ho!

01:16.210 --> 01:17.845
GIRL:
I want one.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.781
You look like you've been
naughty.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.850
No? There you go.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.819
Ho-ho!

01:25.819 --> 01:28.189
Well, look what
the reindeer dragged in.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.158
This is for you,
Frank.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.193
Wow. Last time
I got a present
in this hospital

01:32.193 --> 01:34.728
is when that helicopter
fell on Romano.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.829
For you.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.165
Oh, wow, a neon
stethoscope.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.666
Thanks, Santa Kovac.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.601
What about me?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.871
'N Sync's Greatest Hits?
You didn't?!

01:43.871 --> 01:45.473
I mean,
I was hoping you didn't.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.175
I love this love.
Bear tickets.
Thanks, man.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.276
Just one?

01:48.276 --> 01:49.410
Looks like it's
you and me, man.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.212
Okay, and now
the bonus.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.247
Since it's Christmas Eve,
we're only going to need

01:53.247 --> 01:55.749
a skeleton crew tonight, so I'm
letting three support staff

01:55.749 --> 01:58.519
and one resident home
with pay.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.720
I did the manual
disimpaction.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.422
I did a pelvic
on a 300-pounder.

02:01.422 --> 02:05.226
I debrided maggots
out of a diabetic ulcer,
you wankers.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.461
This is going to jinx us
into a night of trauma hell.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.729
Okay, Rock-Paper-Scissors.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.799
Neela and Morris,
you're first.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.367
No, this is sheet metal.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.468
Morris, you're out.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.569
Pratt.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.872
Ray.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.310
You suck.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.212
Thank you, thank you,
and thank you.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.713
Michael and I are
going to Jamaica

02:25.713 --> 02:27.381
and I have tons
of packing to do.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.217
What, somebody
giving lap dances

02:29.217 --> 02:30.618
and I wasn't
even invited?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.353
Santa's sending
people home.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.256
"'N Sync."
I didn't know
you were gay.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.325
Evil elf.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.659
It's the thought
that counts.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.661
Maybe you could think
about calling Jodie back,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.230
getting her off
my freaking back.

02:42.230 --> 02:42.896
She did not
call again.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.232
Eight times.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.767
Look, is there any way

02:46.767 --> 02:48.269
to, like, change
the main number?

02:48.269 --> 02:50.604
Maybe you could work
from somewhere

02:50.604 --> 02:53.707
with a different extension,
like Cambodia.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.249
Ah! Hi.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.616
Oh, hi.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.984
Sorry I'm late.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.886
I had to pick up the cake
for the Christmas party.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.255
No problem.
Come here.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.996
Oh, wow.
That's for me?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.498
Yeah. Open it.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.867
Now?
Yeah.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.269
I can't.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.736
Oh, tomorrow morning then.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.505
Okay.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.476
Are we spending
Christmas together?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.478
That's what you said last night.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.280
No, I didn't.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.382
You probably don't remember
other things you said.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.649
Shut up.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.655
I never said anything about us.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.291
We should.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.425
We should?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.761
Okay.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.697
I should change.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.998
I'll help.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.807
Is Alex playing
hockey again?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.442
They just don't move you

04:01.442 --> 04:03.344
from out of state
for no reason.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.413
Make sure that coach
doesn't bench him
this year.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.314
He's got skills.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.482
Are you listening to me?

04:08.482 --> 04:10.451
Yes.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.452
I need to see
him, Sammy.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.686
Steve...

04:12.686 --> 04:14.422
It'd really help me
right now.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.824
I want to know why
you were moved
to Illinois?

04:16.824 --> 04:20.827
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.768
Do you still have the guitar
that I gave Alex?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.337
Yeah.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.538
The DVD player,
camcorder?

04:30.538 --> 04:31.805
Yes.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.576
People might come
looking for those.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.512
People with warrants.

04:38.512 --> 04:41.449
Unbelievable.

04:41.449 --> 04:44.652
You are such
a piece of crap.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.086
I'll explain
everything to Alex.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.388
No, you won't.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.656
Don't call
and don't write.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.990
I've changed, Sam,
I really have.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.459
God is helping me.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.893
Oh, yeah? Hell of a job
he's doing.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.462
He's making me see things

04:54.462 --> 04:55.463
that I've done wrong.
Sam, please?

04:55.463 --> 04:57.431
Merry Christmas, jerk-off.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.074

Tamara Gordon, 30,
altered restrained MVC

05:50.784 --> 05:52.486
with passenger space intrusion.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.722
OLBES:
Tachy to 110,
good BP, sats 97%.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.123
Frontal hematoma,
breath sounds clear.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.625
I'm Dr. Kovac.
How are you doing, Tamara?

05:57.625 --> 05:58.792
I'm okay.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.893
Do you remember
what happened?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.595
TAMARA:
Bring the green one...

06:01.595 --> 06:02.963
Other driver
skidded on black ice.
Let her tell me.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.466
Tamara?
Tamara?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.701
Ah, she's seizing!

06:07.701 --> 06:08.936
Two of ativan.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.170
Could be an
intra-cranial bleed.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.905
Let CT know we'll
be up there

06:11.905 --> 06:13.874
as soon as seizure
stops.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.043
I need background
singers for the party tonight.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.177
Ooh, I'll do it.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.712
I want someone
to have my back,

06:18.712 --> 06:19.613
not stab me in it.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.449
Baby, I got your back.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.951
I'm looking for somebody
who can sing, sing.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.519
I can sing sing.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.020
Seriously, I got soul.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.589
I'm super bad.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.991
Haleah takes her Christmas gig
very seriously.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.926
I grew up in a
Baptist church.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.528
I'm holding auditions
in the lounge.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.763
You're welcome
to sign up.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.465
And so are you,
Dr. Weaver.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.499
Yeah. For the tenth
year in a row,

06:38.499 --> 06:39.833
I think I'll pass.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.935
75-year-old male,
cough times two days,

06:41.935 --> 06:43.604
no significant history,

06:43.604 --> 06:44.605
afebrile,
vitals normal.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.939
Exam?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.107
Good breath sounds.
Otherwise, unremarkable.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.509
X ray?

06:48.509 --> 06:49.777
Normal heart,
lung fields clear.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.712
Your dispo?

06:51.712 --> 06:52.913
I was about to send
him home,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.214
but he started
complaining

06:54.214 --> 06:55.916
of severe
epigastric pain.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.518
Did you check
amylase and lipase?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.052
Yeah. Not back yet.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.755
All right.
Let's see how
he's doing.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.957
Doc, am I going
to lay here all day

07:03.957 --> 07:05.659
just like a piece of herring?

07:05.659 --> 07:08.496
I sure hope not,
Mr. Goldstein.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.798
I'm allergic to pickled fish.
Dr. Clemente.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.966
Oh, Doc, do I look pale?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.702
I feel like I'm pale.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.570
You know,
let me check you out

07:16.570 --> 07:17.838
so you can go home
right away.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.206
Can you see if my
cell count is back

07:19.206 --> 07:20.541
on my lizard-breeder's LP?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.675
Sure.
Thank you.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.511
Pupils equal and sluggish.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.079
Tamara, you were
in a car accident.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.515
Do you know
where you are?

07:27.515 --> 07:28.616
In a hospital?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.017
Heart rate's 127.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.752
Okay, hang a liter
of NS.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.954
Tamara, can you
tell me today's date?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.055
Chest wall stable.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.089
Christmas Eve.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.090
Good.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.594
December 24, Chicago.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.062
Breath sounds okay.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.531
1986.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.066
Still post-ictal.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.836
Tamara, do you have
any medical disorder:

07:48.836 --> 07:49.870
Seizures?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.272
Tamara?

07:52.272 --> 07:53.707
Tamara?!

07:53.707 --> 07:56.143
Tamara!
She's not responding.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.210
It could be
subclinical seizure.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.646
Another two of ativan.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.581
Radiology says
CT's negative.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.249
Sat's only 86.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.617
Okay, crank up
the O2.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.652
Guys, she's hyponatremic.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.253
Hypotonic saline,
25 cc's.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.287
We don't keep that
in here.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.656
Got to go
to the drug lockup.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.890
Go get it, then.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.559
I can't leave.
I'm the only nurse.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.793
Guys, she's
going apneic.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.061
Okay, bag her
through it.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.563
You guys need
an extra hand in here?

08:15.563 --> 08:16.664
Where are
the other nurses?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.131
Oh, well,
we're a little light,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.800
seeing as Santa Claus
sent half of 'em home.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.007
ABBY:
Hey, you out of here?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.241
I'm a little nervous.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.577
Well, it's a honeymoon,
Neela.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.778
You're going
to have fun.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.912
I'm not worried
about that.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.080
Oh, right,
you hate to fly.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.582
Oh, it's not
that either.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.783
I've got my Xanax
and a sleeping mask.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.717
So what is it?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.019
We're stopping
at his parent''
for Christmas dinner

08:39.019 --> 08:40.220
before we go.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.955
Ah. Do they know
you're married?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.890
I heard Michael
tell them on the phone.

08:43.890 --> 08:44.925
And?

08:44.925 --> 08:46.259
Then I heard a dial tone.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.294
We need to confer.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.796
ABBY:
Confer?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.799
I have some
department chief business

08:51.799 --> 08:54.001
to go over with you
in lockup.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.269
I'm checking
LP results for Clemente.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.639
Clemente can wait.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.341
You guys seem cozy.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.910
Yeah.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.077
We're spending
Christmas together.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.713
Really?

09:05.713 --> 09:08.081
Look up.
You got to kiss.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.349
Kiss?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.619
Britney and Madonna did it.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.187
Perverts start young
these days.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.757
Hyponatremia
is the condition

09:16.757 --> 09:18.659
in which the sodium
concentration of the blood

09:18.659 --> 09:20.227
is abnormally low.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.030
It does weird things to
the fluid balance of the body

09:23.030 --> 09:24.632
that can cause serious
problems like seizures.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.233
How'd she get this?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.235
Well, a lot of things
can cause it.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.003
Any vomiting,
diarrhea?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.238
No.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.306
Do you take
diuretics, laxatives?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.642
No.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.710
Okay.
Creatinine's normal.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.078
Kidney's seem
to be working all right.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.681
How long before
I can go home?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.182
Oh, you're not
going home.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.383
I mean,
at least not tonight.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.218
But I'm fine.

09:45.218 --> 09:48.188
You need to be admitted.

09:48.188 --> 09:52.660
I got two kids
that are expecting gifts

09:52.660 --> 09:53.661
under the tree tomorrow.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.796
Okay, I understand,

09:55.796 --> 09:57.364
but we need to work this up
to find out

09:57.364 --> 09:58.832
why your sodium's so low

09:58.832 --> 10:01.769
so that this
never happens again.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.037
No. I can't do this to my kids.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.642
So whose kitchen
are you dirtying up tomorrow?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.010
I don't know.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.712
I hadn't really
given it much thought.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.880
Guess what I got you?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.081
Give me a hint.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.050
Um, it's small.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.787
Small. A necklace.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.889
It's not jewelry.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.324
Hey, our hyponatremia lady
is signing out AMA.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.893
She can't.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.260
Then maybe you want
to come and stop her.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.729
Okay, I'll be right out.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.430
Luka.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.232
Yeah?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.736
You're going to love
what I got you.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.369
You didn't get me
anything.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.705
Yes, I did.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.806
No, you didn't.
I did, too.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.073
Keep guessing.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.809
All right. Not jewelry.
Sparkplugs.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.276
Right.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.377
A glass frog.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.713
How did you know?

10:45.713 --> 10:46.880
I'm not even close?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.849
Listen, page me
when you have a clue.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.250
Okay.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.057
Well, just come over

10:57.057 --> 10:58.191
when you're done
with your mother's.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.760
I don't care how late it is.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.729
You know,
I got a stocking for you.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.197
Actually, I have two-- They're
fishnets and I'm gonna...

11:04.197 --> 11:05.365
Ooh, I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.900
You're late.
I got tied up.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.368
Uh-huh.
Well, the phones
still work.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.838
Sorry, I had to drop
my kid off at a friend's house

11:10.838 --> 11:12.740
and then I had to take care
of some personal stuff.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.374
Get in line. You know my
linebacker just called.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.743
He was supposed
to spend the weekend
with me.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.844
I think he's
flaking out.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.745
Linebacker, huh?

11:17.745 --> 11:19.079
He plays for Cincinnati.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.381
Hey, our ice skater's back
from Radiology.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.016
All right, I'll pick up
her films.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.852
Six-year-old female,
single GSW to the abdomen.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.086
Shallow resps, tachy in
the 150s, Bp at 150 palp.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.354
Access?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.488
In the left tibia.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.489
It hurts.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.859
Please, you got to help her!

11:31.859 --> 11:32.826
Good breath sounds.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.827
How'd this happen?

11:33.827 --> 11:35.128
We were buying garlands

11:35.128 --> 11:36.764
and a bullet came through
the window.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.397
There was a dead guy
at the scene.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.999
700 cc's en route.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.133
Trauma One.
Let's go.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.401
What's her name?
Danielle.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.503
Daniell, we're going
to fix you up, okay?

11:43.503 --> 11:44.972
Oh, lost the carotid.
No pulse.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.940
Does that mean
that she's dying?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.912
Satinksy.
Cross clamping the aorta.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.280
400 cc NS bolus

11:53.280 --> 11:55.315
and call for two more units
of O-neg.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.283
Cordis
introducer.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.384
Chest is dry.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.987
WEAVER:
Hold compressions.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.289
ABBY:
Still no pulse.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.524
Another epi and get
ready with atropine.

12:04.524 --> 12:08.028
CBC and trauma panel,
type and cross for four.

12:08.028 --> 12:11.164
Belly's full of blood.
Notify the O.R.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.033
Subclavian's in,
threading easily.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.267
Check for pulses
with compressions.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.003
WEAVER:
She's got a carotid.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.138
She needs a foley.
O.R.'s ready.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.011
I've got the blood bank,
two units.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.946
PRATT:
Make it four and tell
them to rush it.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.080
Hey, Chuny, page
Olivia Evans.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.448
She's at the
social worker party.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.083
See if she can come
down for this woman.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.287
CAROLERS:
* Joy to the world

12:34.287 --> 12:37.424
* The Savior reigns

12:37.424 --> 12:39.860
* Let Earth
receive... *

12:39.860 --> 12:40.961
Eight candles!

12:40.961 --> 12:43.296
And we get gifts
with each one.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.365
What the hell
is Kwanza anyway?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.100
It's a made-up thing
like Flag Day.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.235
Who you calling
made-up, fat boy?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.536
Yeah, fat boy!

12:49.536 --> 12:50.971
Is her husband okay
with her leaving?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.339
BARNETT:
I get the impression

12:52.339 --> 12:53.841
she generally makes
the decisions.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.442
Never heard
that one before.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.544
Repeat electrolytes
aren't even back yet.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.979
How about the UA?

12:58.979 --> 13:01.381
Uh, it's normal,

13:01.381 --> 13:03.016
but we still don't know
what the cause is.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.119
Mrs. Gordon,
do you understand

13:06.119 --> 13:08.288
that you'll be leaving
against medical advice?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.157
Honey, why don't you
go get the car.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.992
I'll meet you
out front.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.160
It's okay, just go.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.062
You shouldn't
go home yet.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.163
I feel much better.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.065
Hyponatremia is serious.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.532
You need to stay here
and be monitored.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.235
I thought you fixed me
with that saline stuff.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.404
No, no,
the fix could be temporary.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.538
If your sodium
falls again,

13:25.538 --> 13:26.974
you could have
another seizure.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.008
KOVAC:
Or worse.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.477
It's Christmas.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.113
Severe hyponatremia
can cause a coma,

13:33.113 --> 13:35.482
permanent brain
damage, even death.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.250
We got an MVA rolling in.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.952
I'll meet you
in a second.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.892
We need to figure out
why this is happening.

13:44.892 --> 13:47.460
That's the only way
for us to help you.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.929
You can't help me.

13:52.432 --> 13:57.070
Three months ago, I went to
the doctor for a stomachache,

13:57.070 --> 13:59.907
I walked out a cancer patient.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.541
Ovarian.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.545
I'm sorry.

14:05.545 --> 14:09.316
It had already spread
to the liver and the lungs.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.252
Five year survival,
less than five percent.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.955
All the more reason
for you to stay.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.256
You can't fight this

14:16.256 --> 14:18.591
if you don't
take care of yourself.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.560
I don't want to fight this.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.230
Treatment
means surgery,

14:23.230 --> 14:26.499
chemo, months in a hospital bed.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.435
I don't want that.

14:28.435 --> 14:32.339
I don't want my kids
to remembering me

14:32.339 --> 14:38.278
as this weak, bald, dying woman.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.314
I can devote
my remaining time

14:41.314 --> 14:46.954
to some futile fight
or to my family.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.224
I'm choosing my family.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.195
What does your
husband want?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.097
He doesn't know.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.035
Look, after the holidays,
I'll tell him.

15:03.370 --> 15:07.407
But right now... I'm going home.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.348
I already told you:
it happened so fast.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.616
No license plate,
nothing?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.986
No.
Why don't you give her a break.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.088
I'll call you
if anything changes.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.522
Thanks.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.991
He asked me if I
saw the guy's face

15:23.991 --> 15:25.058
and I didn't, so...

15:25.058 --> 15:26.994
It's okay. It's okay.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.395
They're trying
to stabilize her.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.230
We want to get her up to surgery
as soon as possible.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.398
Oh, that's good.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.533
Here are her things.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.074
I told her Santa wouldn't
bring her anything

15:41.074 --> 15:42.509
unless she
wrote it all down.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.478
We're doing everything we can.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.048
Neighborhood's
always been dangerous.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.682
When I moved to New York,

15:49.682 --> 15:53.520
I asked my mom to come live
with us but she wouldn't.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.255
Do you want me
to call her,

15:55.255 --> 15:56.556
arrange to have her
meet you here?

15:56.556 --> 15:59.059
Her diabetes--
she can barely walk.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.627
Well, is there anyone else?
A friend or family...?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.395
My husband.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.364
He's flying in tonight,

16:04.364 --> 16:07.634
but he doesn't
know about this.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.037
Is there anything
I can get you?

16:10.037 --> 16:12.139
I should try
Jason again.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.075
Maybe I can catch him
during the layover.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.209
Thanks.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.120
Yeah, hey, this is Dr. Kovac
from the ER,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.288
looking for a repeat
sodium level

16:28.288 --> 16:29.556
on a patient:
Tamara Gordon.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.358
Dr. Kovac, are you
auditioning today?

16:31.358 --> 16:32.459
I'm not sure yet.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.693
Hey, schizo.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.528
Mickey Goldstein's labs
are back.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.563
What about you,
Dr. Clemente?

16:36.563 --> 16:38.498
Are you a singer?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.567
* Deck the halls
with boughs of holly *

16:40.567 --> 16:42.135
*Fa-la-la-la-la...
Very nice.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.303
Abby's short
on baked goods,

16:43.303 --> 16:45.605
so maybe you can
help her out there.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.474
Okay, Good news.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.743
All your blood tests
came back completely normal.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.179
Bad news.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.346
I feel like
there's a truck

16:53.346 --> 16:54.414
parked on my spleen.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.582
Well, you can
go home now.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.483
Merry Christmas.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.650
Wait a minute, my cough.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.551
What about
this terrible cough?

16:58.551 --> 17:00.220
Don't worry about it.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.521
It's probably just
a little virus, that's all.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.290
Virus? Well, can a virus
cause chest pain?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.559
What chest pain?

17:06.559 --> 17:09.096
Oh, terrible massive pressure,
right here.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.463
Oh, the pain.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.763
Why didn't you tell
the other doctor about it?

17:11.763 --> 17:13.599
It just started
a little while ago.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.535
Mm-hmm.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.673
You still stuffing
that suit?

17:20.673 --> 17:22.375
I went to buy
some Kinte cloth

17:22.375 --> 17:24.111
but the salesgirls used it all

17:24.111 --> 17:25.345
to wipe themselves.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.679
That's why I kicked
your ass.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.815
How did you guys
get started in this anyway?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.317
Some "employee" complained

17:30.317 --> 17:32.485
that our company
only celebrates Christmas,

17:32.485 --> 17:34.754
so the boss decided
to throw a PC holiday party

17:34.754 --> 17:36.256
to show
how we all get along.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.690
EVE:
That sounds
like a plan.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.693
Santa, how do you handle
one of those on your lap?

17:40.693 --> 17:42.629
Oh, we break out
the big Santa for that one.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.164
Okay, that's enough.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.798
Maybe I should
bring her a leg tomorrow.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.767
You don't stop talking,
I'm gonna shove a leg...
Eve...

17:47.767 --> 17:49.769
You're a real
nutcracker.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.139
You want to help me
jingle my bells?

17:52.139 --> 17:53.540
You know, instead of pissing
all over everyone else,

17:53.540 --> 17:54.674
piss in that, okay?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.709
I'm in too much pain
to walk.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.479
I need
a urine sample-- now!

17:59.479 --> 18:01.581
Crit's 31.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.715
Hold compressions.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.151
I've got
a weak pulse.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.318
All right, that's what
I want to hear.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.154
Let's get a BP.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.589
All right,
tube position looks good.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.590
What's the delay?

18:10.590 --> 18:11.591
Surgery's here.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.592
Where's Dubenko?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.261
On vacation.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.528
I'm Dr. Albright.
I'm covering for him.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.164
PRATT:
Bullet in right upper quadrant.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.631
Cross clamped the aorta
for traumatic full arrest.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.167
ALBRIGHT:
You told us
almost an hour ago

18:20.167 --> 18:21.901
you were redlining this patient
to the O.R.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.636
We've got a whole team scrubbed
and waiting.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.837
She hasn't been stable enough
to move.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.639
Didn't have a pulse.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.575
Be more discriminating when
you use the word "redline."

18:28.575 --> 18:29.576
We hear it, we
drop everything

18:29.576 --> 18:31.178
and run to the O.R.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.180
You don't redline
a pulseless patient.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.881
Yeah, well, the important thing
is she has a pulse now,

18:34.881 --> 18:37.184
She's bradying down.
so let's go.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.718
And we just lost
that pulse.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.353
Resume compressions.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.189
Wow, you have a real
three-ring circus in here.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.890
Dr. Albright,
I don't think we've met.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.693
I'm Dr. Weaver, chief of staff.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.561
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.662
I'm the surgical Chief resident.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.664
Just got back
from a VA rotation.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.899
Good for you.
Epinephrine, point two.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.334
Type-specific
blood is up.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.702
PRATT:
Hang a unit.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.237
Give us a call when
you know what's going on.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.505
I know what's going on.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.906
We can't hold the O.R.
for a dead kid.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.274
She's not dead.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.609
Uh-huh.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.579
What the hell?

19:06.579 --> 19:08.548
She's a bitch, but
unfortunately, she's right.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.217
Let's get
the mom in here.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.219
All right, I'm going in
with an atrial line.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.821
14 gauge
and four more units.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.757
CAROLERS:
* Noel, noel

19:17.757 --> 19:20.527
* Noel, noel...

19:22.695 --> 19:24.297
Hey.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.665
Merry Christmas, Doctors.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.699
Merry Christmas.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.368
You're letting her
go home?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.602
You saw her sodium level.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.404
She needs to be home.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.406
She could develop
central pontine
myelinolysis.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.707
She could start
seizing again.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.477
We'll re-check her level
in the morning.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.380
She promised to come back after
her kids open their presents.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.449
You're not gonna believe this.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.850
Joe just called.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.352
He wants to spend Christmas
at his mother's.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.553
That could be fun.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.654
Without me.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.889
Well, maybe

19:49.889 --> 19:51.724
it's a family tradition.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.560
You guys can spend New Year's
together.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.727
I guess.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.896
* We wish you a merry
Christmas *

19:56.896 --> 20:00.467
* We wish you
a merry Christmas... *

20:00.467 --> 20:02.269
Isn't this cute?

20:02.269 --> 20:03.503
Ray Charles,
Stevie Wonder

20:03.503 --> 20:06.473
and Roy Orbison
together at last.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.774
What did you just say?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.942
My bad, Roy Orbison
wasn't blind.

20:09.942 --> 20:10.977
He just wore
the glasses.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.912
You sit down.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.681
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.849
You're ruining
our performance!

20:16.849 --> 20:18.818
You guys sound great.
Keep going.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.020
Yeah, and don't
yell at me again

20:21.020 --> 20:22.689
or you won't see any gifts
under the tree.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.524
Oops, my bad! You
won't see 'em anyway.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.525
( laughing )

20:32.332 --> 20:34.701
Ho, ho, ho, you
piece of crap.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.504
Resume compressions.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.539
Another atropine
and stand by with epi.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.508
She's had eight rounds
of meds, Pratt.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.042
Bring her mom in.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.911
Just five more minutes.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.614
The cardiac line might help us
catch up with her blood loss.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.015
I'm getting her now.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.583
I'll go get her.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.791
Is she okay?

20:58.791 --> 21:01.461
I'll let you guys talk.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.663
Would you like to come in
and see your daughter?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.765
Are you finished?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.000
How is she doing?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.337
Danielle's condition
is very serious.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.604
But you're helping her.
I can see that.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.939
We've given
her fluids,

21:12.939 --> 21:14.507
we've give her medicines,

21:14.507 --> 21:16.476
we've even opened up
her chest,

21:16.476 --> 21:18.511
but her heart's just not
beating on its own.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.847
What are you saying?

21:20.847 --> 21:23.950
Nadine, please,
come with me...
No. Just go back in there

21:23.950 --> 21:25.452
and you help her.

21:25.452 --> 21:29.756
It would be good for her
to have you there.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.392
Just hearing your voice.
( sobbing )

21:32.392 --> 21:34.427
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.635
MARQUEZ:
Sat's are not coming up.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.970
It's getting harder
to bag her.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.506
Up the rate.
Watch your pressures.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.608
PRATT:
It's okay, you
can get close.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.486
Hey, sweetie.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.955
You have been
so strong today.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.559
She responded
to the calcium?

22:06.559 --> 22:09.061
We've given her medications

22:09.061 --> 22:10.897
to try to restart
her heart,

22:10.897 --> 22:12.399
but nothing's working.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.934
She lost
too much blood.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.539
They've been working
real hard

22:19.539 --> 22:21.040
to keep you here.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.814
Remember how I told you
God does things for a reason?

22:27.814 --> 22:32.819
Well, maybe he just wants
you with him real bad right now.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.955
I want you to know...

22:40.860 --> 22:44.864
I want you to know
that it's okay to let go.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.534
See, God doesn't want you
to be in any pain--

22:47.534 --> 22:49.035
neither does Mommy.

22:49.035 --> 22:53.840
Daddy and I,
we love you

22:53.840 --> 22:57.009
so much.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.947
We will always love you.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.949
So...

23:02.949 --> 23:06.819
don't be afraid.

23:06.819 --> 23:10.156
Don't be afraid.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.824
It's all right.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.160
Rate's coming up.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.928
She's got a pulse.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.798
Epi infusion, point one cc
per kilo.

23:18.798 --> 23:19.866
What's happening?

23:19.866 --> 23:21.000
Her heart's beating again.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.469
WEAVER:
Package her up.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.703
Let's go.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.971
I want her fired.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.473
Things got a little
out of hand.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.507
She poured pee on me!

23:27.507 --> 23:28.841
At least it was your pee.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.042
Oh, you think
that's funny?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.611
These guys saw
what happened.
Saw it?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.945
We can still smell it.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.581
What'd you have for lunch,
asparagus fries?

23:34.581 --> 23:35.882
We didn't
see it, Santa.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.784
No, but you heard it.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.620
Yeah, and it sounded
good, you fat bastard.
( laughing )

23:40.620 --> 23:41.688
Dr. Clemente?

23:41.688 --> 23:43.490
Yeah, what's up?

23:43.490 --> 23:44.657
Nice going, Santa.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.925
That nurse boss
you got there

23:45.925 --> 23:48.227
threw urine on me.
I want her fired.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.696
Eve did what?

23:49.696 --> 23:51.698
Yeah, these guys were really
out of control.

23:51.698 --> 23:52.765
Eve told them
to be quiet,

23:52.765 --> 23:54.000
but they wouldn't listen.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.168
So she pours pee on me?!
I want her fired!

23:56.168 --> 23:57.637
Oh, crap.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.106
Hey, you listening to me?

24:00.106 --> 24:03.676
Dr. Clemente,

24:03.676 --> 24:05.177
your East Coast
squeeze is here.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.679
Tell her I'm with
a patient.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.681
She's kind of a looker,

24:08.681 --> 24:10.249
in an interstate off-ramp
kind of way.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.818
Please, Frank,
please, please.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.820
Hey...

24:13.820 --> 24:16.088
I need some help with this.
Where you going?

24:16.088 --> 24:18.090
Take it to Kovac.
He's the boss, right?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.895
I talked to the cops.
The store owner I.D.'d the kids.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.196
He's seen them
around before.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.598
They're going
to pick them up now.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.099
NADINE:
Good. That's good.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.835
PRATT:
What the hell are
you talking about?

24:28.835 --> 24:30.737
You're supposed to be holding
a room for my GSW.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.038
Tell them this kid
can' wait.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.540
I don't care.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.074
The kid can't wait.
Her chest is open.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.743
She's got a pulse.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.245
Two minutes and that's it.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.149
The O.R.'s full.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.752
They're going to take her
as soon as they can.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.920
Now! They're going
to take my child now.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.188
or else I'll move her
to another hospital.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.757
She's not stable
enough to move.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.158
I want you to call
Shriner's or Children's.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.594
Look, if they don't call
back within two minutes,

24:54.594 --> 24:58.164
I'll take her up myself.
I promise, okay?

24:58.164 --> 25:04.971
( off-key ):
* Holy infant,
so tender and mild *

25:04.971 --> 25:12.879
* Sleep in heavenly peace

25:12.879 --> 25:16.883
* Sleep
in heavenly peace. *

25:16.883 --> 25:20.653
( off-key ):
* Silent night

25:20.653 --> 25:24.724
* Holy night

25:24.724 --> 25:28.027
* All is calm

25:28.027 --> 25:31.764
* All is bright

25:31.764 --> 25:39.005
* Round young virgin,
mother and child... *

25:39.005 --> 25:46.178
( off-key ):
* Holy infant
so tender and mild *

25:46.178 --> 25:52.752
( voice cracking ):
* Sleep in heavenly peace

25:52.752 --> 25:57.857
* Sleep
in heavenly peace. *

25:59.325 --> 26:00.660
* Jingle bells, jingle...

26:00.660 --> 26:01.628
( clearing throat )

26:01.628 --> 26:03.029
* Jingle bells...

26:03.029 --> 26:05.031
What...
how did it go?

26:05.031 --> 26:06.232
Remember Debbie Allen from Fame?

26:06.232 --> 26:07.967
Yeah.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.670
Yeah, well, Haleh makes her
look like Mother Teresa.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.138
HALEH:
Next!

26:17.209 --> 26:18.778
You punched
a patient.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.046
He's lucky
I didn't have a gun.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.147
You can get
suspended for this.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.682
Oh, the guy's a moron.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.651
He's a moron who wants
to call his lawyer.

26:24.651 --> 26:25.652
Good, I'll punch
him too.

26:25.652 --> 26:26.886
Now, keep the splint dry.

26:26.886 --> 26:30.022
Watch for any pain,
numbness, discoloration.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.924
And remember, just 'cause
Santa's reindeer can fly,

26:31.924 --> 26:33.225
doesn't mean
you can, okay?

26:33.225 --> 26:34.293
Eve...

26:34.293 --> 26:35.828
I'm busy. Walk with me.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.029
Eve, hold on.
What?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.698
You have to go over there
and apologize.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.232
You want me to say
I'm sorry

26:40.232 --> 26:42.001
to some jerk who was
teasing blind kids?

26:42.001 --> 26:44.170
I want you to apologize
so we can salvage
this situation.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.171
And if I don't?

26:45.171 --> 26:46.739
You can lose your job!

26:46.739 --> 26:48.675
Listen, Dr. Kovac, you may
have gotten a gold star

26:48.675 --> 26:50.009
and become chief
of the department,

26:50.009 --> 26:51.911
but I hate
to break it to you--

26:51.911 --> 26:54.146
only the nursing
supervisor can fire me.

26:56.749 --> 27:00.687
Okay, we've got no signs of
ischemia or LVH or arrhythmias.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.722
So, what have I got?

27:02.722 --> 27:04.156
You've got absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.391
Wait a minute,
what about the headache?

27:05.391 --> 27:07.393
What headache?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.061
This terrible pounding
between my eyes?
You've got pounding, yeah?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.763
Yeah, it keeps me
awake all night.
Mm-hmm.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.832
And it's worse
during the day.
Right.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.366
You know, I'm starting
to smell something.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.135
Yeah, I smell something.
Yeah, me, too.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.804
What is that?
I don't know, bull crap maybe.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.238
Oh, geez.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.140
Come on, Mickey, first you
say it's your stomach,

27:21.140 --> 27:22.775
then your heart,
then your head. Come on.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.076
Look, I just can't
go home.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.712
Well, you got no choice, okay?

27:25.712 --> 27:27.947
I need these beds
for really sick patients.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.916
Look, I need this bed.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.884
Yeah, well, you know, you've
wasted enough tax dollars.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.119
Come on, just go
home to your wife.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.353
Just go.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.889
My wife died
about four years ago.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.257
So what--
you're tired of spending

27:38.257 --> 27:39.258
Christmas alone?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.760
Tired of watching

27:40.760 --> 27:41.861
Miracle on 34th Street
by yourself?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.362
Yeah, especially
in living color.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.897
Right.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.833
How long you going
to keep me waiting?

27:49.736 --> 27:52.438
I've got... I've got
a patient here, okay, Jodie?

27:52.438 --> 27:53.472
Please, do you mind?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.241
You're signing him out.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.276
No, I'm not signing him out.
He's really sick.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.779
He's got Ohniatis
Muchgotow.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.114
He got it in Brazil,
right, Mickey?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.049
Yeah, right, Brazil.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.917
I never heard of that.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.186
That's right, because you're
an ICU nurse, that's why.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.454
And this is
a toxicology problem.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.256
In fact, he needs
to be admitted

28:10.256 --> 28:12.491
and watched tonight,
and especially tomorrow.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.760
Haleh.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.161
Haleh, please.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.329
Yeah, I've called
you 20 times.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.165
Right, and I haven't answered
you back for a reason.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.067
What's up?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.301
That's why I'm here--

28:22.301 --> 28:23.369
because I wanted
to see you in person.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.004
Breathe normally.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.106
Go back. Go back
to Jersey, go back
to your husband.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.374
Just leave me alone.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.309
My husband is not
going to find me,

28:30.309 --> 28:31.811
so why don't you just relax.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.979
Your husband's a cop, okay?

28:32.979 --> 28:34.046
And don't tell me to relax.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.849
Dr. Clemente, do you need me?

28:36.849 --> 28:38.785
Haleh, yes, I do.

28:38.785 --> 28:41.821
Mr. Goldstein needs
to be signed in and needs
to be observed for...

28:41.821 --> 28:43.890
Systemic Ponderosa.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.925
Systemic Ponderosa.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.059
What?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.928
You heard me.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.429
Just write it down.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.964
( softly ):
I'll explain
it to you later.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.065
Jodie, please.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.168
Come on.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.938
Hurry up.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.807
Have you witnessed
violent behavior before?

29:00.807 --> 29:02.274
I never said
she was violent.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.144
Angry?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.179
She's very good
at her job.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.448
Today was just, a...
a hard day.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.083
Ms. Taggart...

29:11.083 --> 29:12.518
Look, I don't feel comfortable
evaluating her.

29:12.518 --> 29:13.986
She's my boss.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.554
That's part
of management, Sam.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.523
That's what everyone
keeps telling me,

29:17.523 --> 29:20.126
but I don't understand why you
can't just bring her in here

29:20.126 --> 29:21.994
instead of talking
about her behind her back.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.362
I will talk to her,

29:23.362 --> 29:25.464
but we believe in
360 evaluation here

29:25.464 --> 29:27.900
from supervisors, peers
and subordinates.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.970
So I expect you
to be honest with me.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.072
After she punched Santa
and poured the urine on him,

29:33.072 --> 29:34.106
what did she do?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.342
She went to lunch.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.845
Okay.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.412
Thank you for your time,

29:40.412 --> 29:42.314
Ms. Taggart.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.250
So what happens now?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.552
Well, this is grounds
for immediate termination.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.120
Oh, come on.

29:48.120 --> 29:52.024
You can't fire Eve
on Christmas Eve.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.026
Look, it was good
between us, okay?

29:54.026 --> 29:56.062
Actually, actually,
okay, it was great.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.429
But that was for awhile.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.031
God, you look good.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.566
Jodie, you're
married, okay?

30:00.566 --> 30:02.168
Which is something that
you deliberately omitted

30:02.168 --> 30:03.335
when we first met.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.571
You knew.
No, I didn't know.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.406
Okay, at first, at first.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.141
Okay, but you know what?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.409
It doesn't matter now,

30:10.409 --> 30:12.945
because I can't stop
thinking about you.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.313
Jodie, Jodie, stop it,
stop it.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.048
I want you to hop
on the first plane

30:16.048 --> 30:18.050
and get the hell
out of here, okay?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.919
Before your husband
comes here and puts
a bullet in my ass.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.520
Just tell me the truth.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.588
Don't you miss it?

30:22.588 --> 30:24.190
No, not at all.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.525
You never think about it?
You never think about us?

30:26.525 --> 30:28.527
No, I don't think
about us.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.964
See, I think...
that whenever I called,

30:31.964 --> 30:32.932
you wanted me to call.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.533
That's such bull.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.102
I think that whenever
you heard

30:36.102 --> 30:40.006
my voice, you sprung
to attention.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.608
Oh, come on,
don't be ridiculous.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.443
And you went
into a room,

30:44.443 --> 30:46.612
and you saluted
your little soldier.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.882
Big soldier.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.517
I know.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.585
But, see, I'm here
now, baby.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.956
( passionate moaning )

31:03.662 --> 31:05.097
Systolic's up to 83.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.498
The art line's
a little hinky.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.967
If the waveform
looks blunted,
try repositioning.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.335
This is probably
a waste of time,

31:09.335 --> 31:10.569
but it's a good opportunity

31:10.569 --> 31:11.971
for the residents
and medical students

31:11.971 --> 31:13.639
to get a look at
fresh young organs.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.341
This is a child.
Keep that in mind.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.176
Yeah, I'll see you
when you get here, honey.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.510
They're taking her
up to surgery.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.212
Anesthesia will have
some more questions for you.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.347
Thank you.

31:21.347 --> 31:22.949
Danielle's a fighter.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.183
They're going to take
good care of her.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.952
Thank you.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.019
Nice work.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.587
Thanks.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.091
Hey.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.525
Hey, is she going to make it?

31:33.525 --> 31:34.626
Not sure yet.

31:34.626 --> 31:35.627
Did they find
those shooters?

31:35.627 --> 31:37.496
Still looking.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.166
I'm going to come back later.
I need to go out for awhile.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.167
Where you going?

31:41.167 --> 31:43.669
Come see.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.237
You know, when
they find these jerks,

31:45.237 --> 31:46.405
the cops will make
them come here,

31:46.405 --> 31:48.407
make them see
what they've done.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.112
What's all this?

31:53.112 --> 31:55.414
It's a vigil
for Danielle.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.984
But she's not dead.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.019
They're praying
to keep her that way.

32:00.019 --> 32:00.987
Really?

32:00.987 --> 32:03.289
Really.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.524
Not bad, Olivia,
not bad, baby.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.560
Pratt! Our little girl
brady-ed down in the elevator.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.496
Lost her pulse.
Brought her back to Trauma One.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.664
Tell them to keep praying.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.010
( sniffling )

32:31.517 --> 32:33.485
Hey.
Oh.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.023
I just can't believe it.

32:37.023 --> 32:40.326
On Christmas.

32:40.326 --> 32:43.162
I know. I'm so sorry.

32:43.162 --> 32:46.465
I just tried so
hard, you know?

32:46.465 --> 32:49.101
And now I... it...
it's all nothing

32:49.101 --> 32:50.436
You're gonna be fine.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.603
Don't talk like that.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.439
You know how hard
it is out there.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.774
Yeah, but you're experienced.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.344
Hospitals are always looking
for good nurse managers.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.246
What?

33:02.414 --> 33:06.285
What are you
talking about?

33:06.285 --> 33:07.553
What are you talking about?

33:07.553 --> 33:09.655
My boyfriend
just dumped me.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.457
Oh.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.624
Wait a minute.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.293
What did you...?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.427
Am I getting fired?

33:15.427 --> 33:17.729
Uh... I didn't say that.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.731
Answer me!
Am I getting fired?

33:26.438 --> 33:28.407
I've gotta get
back to work.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.076
What?! Oh, of course.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.110
What did I expect?

33:31.110 --> 33:32.211
Jodie, come on.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.445
I'm setting up a
new life here.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.081
I want as little
drama as possible.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.315
You can understand
that, can't you?

33:36.315 --> 33:37.783
Mm-hmm.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.651
Bobby hit me.

33:39.651 --> 33:40.819
What?

33:40.819 --> 33:42.654
Broke a rib.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.390
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.657
But you didn't say anything.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.459
Look, why didn't you
go to the police?

33:47.459 --> 33:50.462
He is the police.
All they would've done is

33:50.462 --> 33:51.730
come over, give Bobby
a high five and then

33:51.730 --> 33:54.100
had a beer with him.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.101
I left him.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.435
Mm-hmm.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.704
Vic, I'm not going back.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.408
Now...

34:02.408 --> 34:05.344
I'm at the Marriott.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.813
If you want
to call me, do,

34:08.813 --> 34:11.117
and if you don't...

34:11.117 --> 34:12.451
then you can have
a nice holiday.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.362
( sighing ):
Oh, my God...

34:24.362 --> 34:25.831
At least she's saving
on long distance.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.367
Come on, Frank.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.400
Was that Jodie?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.869
How do you know her name?

34:30.869 --> 34:32.538
Because she calls Frank
about eight times a day

34:32.538 --> 34:34.172
and I talk to her
about three.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.174
That's great.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.175
Must've been.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.176
Your fly is down.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.543
Hey, Abby.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.512
There's a snowplow
accident coming in.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.148
I'm making Croatian
bread and a turkey.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.181
What are you cooking?

34:43.181 --> 34:44.516
Cooking...

34:44.516 --> 34:46.818
Do you have amnesia from
the last time we dated?

34:50.856 --> 34:53.159
I thought that little girl
was gonna die hours ago.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.592
I guess she's not
ready to go yet.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.527
Is that them?

34:56.527 --> 34:57.863
We got confessions.

34:57.863 --> 34:58.864
Thanks for
bringing them.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.532
You're welcome.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.401
Hey, what are we doing here?

35:02.401 --> 35:04.436
What, you taking us
to the morgue or something?

35:04.436 --> 35:05.504
Somewhere even better.
This way.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.214
What happened?

35:15.214 --> 35:16.815
She was fine until
we tried to move her.

35:16.815 --> 35:17.649
Holding compressions.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.687
She's down on the right.
Tension pneumo.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.490
Chest tube tray and
14 French for Dr. Pratt.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.557
I got the heart.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.558
What's happening?

35:26.558 --> 35:27.893
Her lung collapsed.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.628
We're inserting a tube
to reinflate it.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.430
Nadine.
PRATT:
Betadine.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.364
They found them?

35:32.364 --> 35:33.499
Yes. They're outside.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.833
Is it still okay
if we bring them in?

35:34.833 --> 35:36.368
I don't want to be
in here for that.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.669
I need to be able
to see my daughter.

35:37.669 --> 35:38.770
Okay. Yeah, we can have you go

35:38.770 --> 35:39.938
wait in the hall.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.540
I'll come get
you in a minute.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.310
Hey, nice shot, guys.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.777
We didn't shoot no girl.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.513
No, you didn't mean to,
but your bullet went through

35:47.513 --> 35:49.781
that other guy
and landed here.
Nah, dawg.

35:49.781 --> 35:50.782
Yeah, dawg.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.484
Right into her belly.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.220
Ripped through her liver, her
intestines and her spleen--

35:54.220 --> 35:56.755
tube-- Took out countless
veins and arteries

35:56.755 --> 35:58.624
along the way, causing
her abdomen to fill up

35:58.624 --> 36:00.459
with blood.
She's bleeding out so fast

36:00.459 --> 36:01.527
we had to crack her chest open.

36:01.527 --> 36:02.828
Yo, get us out of here.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.596
No, no. Stay. Admire your work.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.265
You know, your
one shot is probably

36:06.265 --> 36:07.633
gonna kill
this little girl,

36:07.633 --> 36:09.635
and if she lives, well...
think about it. What if

36:09.635 --> 36:11.703
this was your little sister
lying here, having to have

36:11.703 --> 36:13.739
her intestines removed
and crap into a bag

36:13.739 --> 36:14.773
for the rest of her life?

36:14.773 --> 36:16.742
Pratt.
Answer me.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.744
Come on, man.
And while
you're laying

36:18.744 --> 36:20.846
in that jail cell,
I want you to remember what

36:20.846 --> 36:22.648
you did to this
little girl.

36:22.648 --> 36:23.949
And for what?
A dime bag?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.351
'Cause somebody
looked at you wrong?

36:25.351 --> 36:26.852
All right, let's get
them out of here.

36:26.852 --> 36:27.853
Her name's
Danielle Hopkins.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.288
She's six years old!

36:32.724 --> 36:35.561
Hey... You got me fired?

36:35.561 --> 36:36.695
I don't have anything
to do with you, remember?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.330
Check with the nursing
supervisor.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.266
Yeah, I just did.
She said I had to clear out

36:40.266 --> 36:41.267
within the next two hours.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.268
You know it's Christmas.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.702
You'll be missed.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.271
Bite me.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.273
Don't make me call Security.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.974
Oh, no, it's fine, I'm leaving
on my own, but you know,

36:48.974 --> 36:50.909
I tried to do
something good here.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.811
I tried to elevate
this stupid ER,

36:52.811 --> 36:55.947
and instead of getting praise,
I get fired on Christmas Eve?!

36:55.947 --> 36:58.284
Screw yourselves.
You all suck.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.785
Eve, come on.
Calm down.
Oh, you,

36:59.785 --> 37:01.520
you, behind my back,
trying to get my job.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.854
Merry Christmas, Judas.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.301
They've controlled
the bleeding.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.968
Vitals are good.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.305
It looks like she's
gonna pull through this.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.043
I always wanted a girl.

37:25.043 --> 37:29.415
I thought it would
be easier, safer...

37:29.415 --> 37:31.317
Those guys are gonna pay
for what they did.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.651
I don't want
them to pay.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.453
I want them to stop.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.588
We turn our backs
on these kids,

37:36.588 --> 37:39.325
we don't educate them and then
we wonder why this happens.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.363
People have choices.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.632
Some people don't know they do.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.003
Is it over?

37:52.003 --> 37:53.672
Not bad for
your first shift.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.341
Cleared the board
and an employee.

37:55.341 --> 37:56.408
I didn't have
a choice.

37:56.408 --> 37:57.643
Yeah. I gotta go
get Henry.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.944
I'll see you at Ike's.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.045
Hey, what's up?

38:00.045 --> 38:01.413
Nothing.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.349
I'm gonna go
play my game.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.485
Thank you so much

38:06.485 --> 38:08.654
for having a play
date on Christmas Eve.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.522
I can take 'em on New
Year's if you want.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.524
You know, Sam,
I don't think so.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.393
What's wrong?
Is there a problem?

38:14.393 --> 38:17.629
Alex keeps telling Willie
his father's dead.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.631
That's not true.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.534
And now he's telling Willie
his dad's gonna die, too.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.836
I'm sure he's just
joking around.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.005
Sam, Alex needs help,

38:27.005 --> 38:29.074
and until you get
that for him, I'd prefer

38:29.074 --> 38:30.509
he not hang out with Willie.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.377
Heather.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.378
I'm sorry.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.583
Anything I can do?

38:37.583 --> 38:39.551
Uh... thanks, I got it.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.724
Alex?

38:45.724 --> 38:47.759
What's up?

38:50.061 --> 38:52.664
Why did you tell Willie
that your father is dead?

38:56.468 --> 38:57.469
Hey, answer me.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.407
I don't need him.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.074
So that's like being dead.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.810
Come on. Your dad
has problems,

39:04.810 --> 39:06.412
but he loves you.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.414
You know that.
I know you love him.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.482
If he loved me, he'd call.

39:10.482 --> 39:13.419
He can't call you, Alex,

39:13.419 --> 39:15.454
but he misses you.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.855
No, he doesn't.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.457
You're just lying for him.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.666
( jazz combo playing )

39:34.606 --> 39:40.078
* Have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

39:40.078 --> 39:43.915
* Let your heart be light

39:43.915 --> 39:57.463

will be out of sight... *

* Make the Yuletide gay

40:08.540 --> 40:17.215

will be miles away... *

40:17.215 --> 40:23.589
* Here we are,
as in olden days *

40:29.828 --> 40:34.500
* Faithful friends
who are dear to us *

40:34.500 --> 40:39.838
* Gather near to us once more

40:39.838 --> 40:41.239
* Yeah, they do

40:41.239 --> 40:44.209
( instrumental break )

41:03.194 --> 41:08.867
* Have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

41:08.867 --> 41:14.072
* Make the Yuletide gay

41:14.072 --> 41:25.150
* From now on our troubles

41:25.150 --> 41:29.555
* Here we are
as in olden days *

41:29.555 --> 41:33.825
* Happy golden days
of yore... *

41:33.825 --> 41:34.860
Hey.
Hi.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.897
What's this?

41:38.897 --> 41:41.199
I brought you
a present.

41:48.574 --> 41:49.741
Wow.

41:51.577 --> 41:52.611
Thank you.

41:52.611 --> 41:53.612
You're welcome.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.048
This beats what I got you.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.885
Open yours.

42:08.694 --> 42:09.995
A compass?

42:11.630 --> 42:13.064
I know it's corny.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.734
It seems we're always
finding each other.

42:16.935 --> 42:19.738
It's beautiful.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.178
Can we talk?

42:29.247 --> 42:31.617
Yeah, sure.

42:31.617 --> 42:32.651
You okay?
Yeah.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.722
Maybe go outside
for a minute?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.642
Okay.

42:56.642 --> 42:58.009
I don't know how
to say this.

42:58.009 --> 42:59.310
What?

42:59.310 --> 43:01.713
Well, it's just that
these past few weeks

43:01.713 --> 43:03.314
have been really, you know,

43:03.314 --> 43:06.051
I-I couldn't have
imagined it better.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.318
For me, too.

43:07.318 --> 43:08.954
Yeah. I haven't
laughed so much

43:08.954 --> 43:10.922
or felt so good in a
really, really long time,

43:10.922 --> 43:12.891
and I don't want to do
anything to ruin that.

43:12.891 --> 43:13.992
Hey, you won't.
I promise.

43:13.992 --> 43:15.226
Luka.

43:15.226 --> 43:17.128
Yeah?

43:17.128 --> 43:18.664
Oh, man.

43:18.664 --> 43:19.731
What?

43:19.731 --> 43:21.166
I'm pregnant.

43:21.166 --> 43:25.904
* Hang a shiny star
upon the highest bough *

43:25.904 --> 43:30.375
* Sing it, child

43:30.375 --> 43:40.852
* And have yourself
a Merry little Christmas now. *
