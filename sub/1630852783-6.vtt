Morning, you.

Hey.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.959
Ready to go in five?

02:28.960 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.719
I'll drive.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.039
Do you mind if I do?
I, uh, I just need my car today.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.040
Liv's asked me to run some errands.
Sure.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.799
Hello, guys.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.960
Hey. Hi. Hiya.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.839
You don't mind if I hog some of
your desk space today, do you?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.480
Uh, no, that's fine.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.639
There you go.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.079
Liv, I've a meeting in town in an hour.
Can we go through the schedule first?

03:21.080 --> 03:24.240
Especially the launch event timings.
Yeah, sure.

Hello, yes.

Well, let me have
a word with him first. Yeah.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.120
Liv… What?

03:58.400 --> 04:02.079
Oh, God, is it bad news? Oh, no.
It's not about the launch.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.280
It's…Elliot.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.800
It's been complicated.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.919
I told you

04:12.920 --> 04:15.639
not to get involved with Elliot.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.680
But you ignored me.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.879
He's scary.
What the hell are you talking about?

04:21.880 --> 04:24.119
He has this way of…

04:24.120 --> 04:27.720
…scaring you into doing things
that you don't want to do.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.840
And making you give up
the things you do.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.639
No, no, no, no, no.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.839
You lied to me for weeks
until he gave you an ultimatum

04:37.840 --> 04:40.519
because you didn't want to be
called out on your bullshit.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.919
That's not true. And now, today,

04:42.920 --> 04:45.640
the day before the launch,
you want to do this?

04:46.600 --> 04:50.159
Why…why don't you just take a massive
shit in my dinner too, while you're at it?

04:50.160 --> 04:52.239
He was doing the same with Chloe.
OK, OK.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.519
You need to stop
your creepy obsession with Chloe.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.360
She was trying to leave him.
Oh, my God… That night!

05:01.320 --> 05:04.280
She had a caravan
she was trying to get to.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.479
I have known Elliot

05:13.480 --> 05:15.320
since I was 15.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.400
And he is basically family.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.079
So whatever it is
you're trying to do,

05:22.080 --> 05:23.320
stop.

I've got a picture here somewhere.

Hello, everyone. Hey.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.959
The guy's put it up already.

That's amazing.
Incredible, isn't it?

Oh. That was this one.

her strong suit, seemingly.

do you have them?

06:28.040 --> 06:30.280
Er, not on me, no.

Not even your driver's licence?
I always forget that.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.560
Right. Well, can you
bring it tomorrow, please?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.760
Sure. No problem.

going to tell me about this?

What do you mean?
Why would you smash my phone?

06:52.280 --> 06:55.719
I-I don't know what you're talking
about. And why do you always lie to me?

06:55.720 --> 06:59.799
You smashed your phone. I don't know what you
mean. What did you think you'd find on it?

06:59.800 --> 07:01.880
I didn't smash your phone.
I… Pull over.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.720

Anyway, Mum won't be back
until at least midweek,

so there's no rush at all. I just
need to get my head together.

so much better after a stay there.

you know, away. Away from people.

Hello, you.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.360
Rich popped down to get Mum's keys. He's going
to spend a couple of days at hers in the country.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.519
Oh, nice.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.680
Glass of wine? Yeah.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.199
Have you seen the…?

10:24.200 --> 10:26.440
Yeah. It's amazing.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.759
Thank you.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.319
Cheers.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.440
Cheers.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.879
Right, I'd better go and get the key
before I forget.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.600
Thanks, man.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.919
Did you see what he did
with my car keys?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.359
Rich?

10:54.360 --> 10:59.079
Rich? I'm not sure… It's fine. I need you to
take me now. We need to go before he gets back.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.919
I don't know what you mean. I just need
to get out of here. I'll explain later.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.440
OK? Please. I said I'd have dinner
with Elliot. I don't… Rich!

11:09.120 --> 11:10.680
I can't.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.640
Fuck! You knew.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.760
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you fucking do!

11:20.640 --> 11:24.519
I thought you cared about her. Why the fuck didn't
you show up? I told you, I got high, I forgot.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.359
Fuck off, Rich!

11:26.360 --> 11:28.599
Fuck off! You didn't forget
because you got high.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.560
You needed to forget, that's why
you got high. I couldn't…

11:33.040 --> 11:36.199
OK, yeah, yeah. OK, fine. Yeah.
You owe him a lot.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.440
Great.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.360
What the fuck?!

11:41.640 --> 11:43.999
Is everything all right?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.040
Everything OK?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.240
Rich? Hm.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.520
Keys. Mm, thanks.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.440
What's going on? No…

12:00.520 --> 12:03.079
Oh, man, I don't know.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.720
I'm just…
I'm just a fuck-up, aren't I?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.879
Don't. Come on.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.479
Are you telling me the place you
went wasn't worth the money?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.399
Is that it? Hm?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.960
Fuck off.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.960
No. No.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.800
You're going to be fine.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.920
Something to eat?

12:40.440 --> 12:41.799
Sasha…

12:41.800 --> 12:44.080
About today in the car.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.600
You know I didn't mean it, right?

12:49.880 --> 12:51.560
I'm sorry.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.680
I'm sorry.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.800
Please. I messed up.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.960
I love you.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.200
I don't want you to be scared of me.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.080
How are you feeling?

14:24.680 --> 14:26.760
Like it's a big day.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.640
It is.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.799
I can't. He's got my car keys.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.359
I need to go without anyone
noticing.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.559
The speech should be at 5pm,
so I can slip out.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.679
Be careful, OK? OK.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.320
Thank you.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.040
Sasha?

15:21.160 --> 15:22.800
Ready? Ready.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.479
What's in there? Er, a gift. I'll
hold on to it until after tonight.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.319
You're so sweet.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.559
Oh, can I pop back in?
Come on, we need to go.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.920
I won't be long. Sasha, we're late.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.400
BUZZ OF CHATTER

15:54.760 --> 15:58.439
Good to be here. Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.880
Thank you.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.799
Sasha, can I borrow you a second?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.600
Em… Can we have one
for the team? Sure.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.080
OK, everyone. Say cheese.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.639
Hey.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.880
Hey.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.239
Must have been very stressful
getting all this ready.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.280
Yeah.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.880
You OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

16:40.280 --> 16:45.320
It's just…Liv said that you and El
have been having some problems.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.400
Anyway, if you want to talk…
What are you doing?

16:54.240 --> 16:56.399
Sorry, what do you mean? Fuck off.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.440
I know you tell Elliot everything.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.439
You knew how scared she was.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.959
Chloe? You knew she wanted to leave.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.199
Right.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.800
You think I don't want to leave
sometimes?

17:10.480 --> 17:14.799
Marriage is hard. And yes, Elliot's a handful
and they had a very tricky relationship,

17:14.800 --> 17:17.320
but so what?
Welcome to the fucking club.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.239
What's going on? What? Phil looked
like you'd just punched him in the face.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.160
I don't know.
Maybe Livia's rubbing off on me.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.920
Could I have your attention, please?

17:43.320 --> 17:46.679
Hello, everyone. It's my pleasure
to welcome you all here

17:46.680 --> 17:50.719
to Elliot Fairbourne's Bristol North
by-election campaign launch.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.240
Without further ado,
Elliot Fairbourne!

17:58.560 --> 18:00.679
Thank you, thank you.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.200
I want to take a moment to thank you
all for being here today.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.119
I'm honoured to be the candidate
for this by-election.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.679
This is a beautiful city,
a unique city.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.159
It never surprises me that
Bristol… What are you doing?

18:15.160 --> 18:18.639
Have you seen the gift bag
for Elliot? Sash, not right now.

18:18.640 --> 18:23.119
Have you seen it? Ssh! Its diversity and
sense of community have shaped my character

18:23.120 --> 18:27.319
and my beliefs. Its culture
and rebellious spirit

18:27.320 --> 18:29.400
are a continuous inspiration.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.720
Sasha!

18:33.680 --> 18:34.960
Sasha!

18:36.400 --> 18:39.199
What are you doing?
Do you know where the gift bag is?

18:39.200 --> 18:44.039
I think Livia put it in the side room with all
the coats and bags. Get it later. I need to go!

18:44.040 --> 18:47.120
What the fuck? What's the matter
with you? Just let me go.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.799
Your one job today is
to not mess this up for El.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.639
If you pull a disappearing act
right now, he'll be off his A-game

18:54.640 --> 18:57.639
and I'll have to clear that up.
My mum's sick. I need to be with her.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.760
She's not sick.
OK, so now you're a doctor?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.719
Please just come back in.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.639
I hate doing this. You'd think the
last one dying would be enough.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.719
Jesus Christ, this is Chloe again?
I'm just saying let me go.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.399
What do you know about Chloe?
I don't know. I don't know!

19:12.400 --> 19:13.879
I just know she was trying to

19:13.880 --> 19:17.759
fucking leave and no-one would let
her! She was always threatening to leave!

19:17.760 --> 19:20.599
She was a privileged housewife who
never worked a day in her fucking life.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.000
She didn't actually want to leave. And she
didn't actually want to die. It was theatrics.

19:26.360 --> 19:30.479
Yeah. I've had enough
of people sanctifying her.

19:30.480 --> 19:34.359
Sure, apparently she was mentally ill, so
now nobody can say a bad word about her,

19:34.360 --> 19:36.200
but she wasn't a fucking saint!

19:37.160 --> 19:39.360
There's two sides to every story.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.199
That makes a lot more sense now.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.159
Is that who the gift bag's from?
He's got nothing to do with it.

19:50.160 --> 19:54.479
Is everything OK? No, mate. You've got
a lot of fucking nerve showing up here.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.580
I've got a lot of nerve? I know
exactly what you're doing here.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.080
Becky? Yeah, sorry, I'm…

20:08.600 --> 20:10.440
And your…

20:15.040 --> 20:17.080
What kind of person does that?

20:18.040 --> 20:21.080
Tracks down the grieving friends
of a dead girl?

20:22.520 --> 20:24.560
But that's…that's not what…

20:25.880 --> 20:27.719
That's… You stole her life

20:27.720 --> 20:30.360
because of some stupid rejection
when you were 17.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.870
No wonder you tried to convince
yourself we did something wrong.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.240
Fuck.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.319
Sorry I've dragged you into all this.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.799
It's OK.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.040
You're out. This is good.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.040
I don't understand why…

21:39.960 --> 21:43.280
Don't you agree with them?
What? That you're crazy?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.639
I mean, I need help, right?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.600
Just a little bit.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.520
We should bounce. Now.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.439
You might want to make yourself
scarce for a bit. Yeah?

22:00.440 --> 22:04.680
We can go to London or… London? Yeah,
yeah, I got a job interview next week.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.479
And if I get it…

22:07.480 --> 22:09.080
I don't know.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.560
I'd be down for a move.
I fucking hate it here.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.840
Maybe.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.720
You do know that Becky and Sasha
are the same person, right?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.559
Do you want something?

22:30.560 --> 22:32.839
I don't know. A new personality?

22:32.840 --> 22:35.279
Would you like
some ketchup with that?

22:35.280 --> 22:37.239
Can I get a cheeseburger, please?

22:37.240 --> 22:38.680
OK.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.760
Can I have a cheeseburger
and a Coke?

23:32.080 --> 23:35.119
And you don't know
where she was going? No.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.320
Her parents? That's where she
ended up anyway. She got a taxi.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.120
What is it? I don't know.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.279
Becky, look…

23:59.280 --> 24:01.799
You're right here. OK?

24:01.800 --> 24:05.400
I just need to do one more thing.
Why?! She called me!

24:09.600 --> 24:11.440
She called me.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.759
She had a caravan, a whole plan.
That's not someone who wants to die.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.879
Becky, her mom saw her jump.
Just let it go.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.639
Yeah, so what happened at her
parents' house for her to do that?

24:20.640 --> 24:23.640
I need to talk to them now
or I'll never know! No, you won't!

24:25.200 --> 24:27.239
Look, this is what happens.

24:27.240 --> 24:31.960
When people die, they leave behind
a whole lot of questions.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.639
We can go to London tomorrow. God…

24:36.640 --> 24:39.759
What…? It's too late.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.440
OK? Look, sometimes…

24:43.400 --> 24:45.799
…it is just too late.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.240
Either I'm right or they are.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.080
About me.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.760
I'm such a fucking idiot.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.880
Can I, um…

25:10.840 --> 25:12.960
Can I drop you off somewhere?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.720
No, I can get a taxi.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.240
Good luck.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.480
Hello?

26:47.480 --> 26:48.520
Hi.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.400
Uh…it's Becky. Green.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.000
We-we thought about getting in
touch.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.640
It's funny she called you, isn't it?

27:01.600 --> 27:04.040
Had she reached out before? No.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.720
You two were so sweet.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.599
What was that thing you used to do?
You'd pick any old bus to get on.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.679
Yeah, we saw so many random suburbs.
Do you remember, Jim?

27:16.680 --> 27:18.959
You wanted some sort of adventure,
I think.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.240
Yes. A pretty strange way
to go about it.

27:22.400 --> 27:26.799
I always… I always appreciated
you being there for her.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.800
You know, coming to stay
when she needed you.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.239
Hey…

27:34.240 --> 27:37.759
Well, it was nice of you to drop by.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.519
Um, how is…um…

27:40.520 --> 27:42.000
Tiger?

27:43.040 --> 27:46.199
Tiger. Oh, she died a few years ago.
Got run over.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.399
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
We got her daughter, Pebble.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.119
Could I meet her?

27:52.120 --> 27:53.640
Hello!

27:55.640 --> 27:59.319
Her dad must have been an ugly
street tabby or something! Aww!

27:59.320 --> 28:01.040
Hello.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.240
There you are.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.920
Ange, I'm so sorry.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.160
Bless you.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.240
Ange…

28:20.480 --> 28:22.359
What…

28:22.360 --> 28:25.160
What happened…that night?

28:26.600 --> 28:30.439
I can't stop thinking about it.
She showed up, distressed,

28:30.440 --> 28:33.359
saying lots of things
that didn't make sense. Like what?

28:33.360 --> 28:36.799
Like she wanted to leave.
All sorts of things.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.240
We knew from her husband that
she'd been on a downward spiral.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.639
He was a saint,
the way he looked after her.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.759
They were childhood sweethearts.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.879
Anyway, she went to bed
and her husband arrived.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.560
In the night,
we realised she was gone.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.000
I drove around for ages, looking.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.199
We arrived just as she jumped.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.440
What…

29:03.840 --> 29:07.120
I just… I…I can't believe that.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.200
I should have known.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.599
It was like she'd given up.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.120
Like the light had gone out
of her eyes.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.520
Ange, I'm so sorry. Oh, Becky.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.160
There's nothing
any of us could have done.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.359
Could I…

29:37.360 --> 29:39.399
Could I see her room?

29:39.400 --> 29:41.280
Of course you can.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.600
CHLOE: Becky, I don't know
how to start this.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.240
I'm so sorry. I've been
so lonely at the new school.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.440
I think about you every day.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.440
I had to make new friends.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.840
If I didn't, I'd be lonely forever.

32:26.960 --> 32:30.010
I think you all could have got on
if I'd brought you together.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.359
I should have told you
about the party.

just show people what they want to see.

He doesn't understand.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.880
He doesn't want me
to send this letter.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.830
Sometimes he gets angry when I do
things he doesn't think are right.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.560

35:09.440 --> 35:11.880
Yeah, yeah. No, but where?

35:13.120 --> 35:14.560
Proxford.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.160
By the old pier.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.600
She was heading to see me…

35:22.640 --> 35:25.680
Ange, what did she say to you?
That night.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.800
She asked me not to say
where she was.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.319
But…when he called,

35:34.320 --> 35:37.840
he was so upset. So scared.

35:38.880 --> 35:42.919
They…they'd been looking everywhere
for her. They thought she was in town.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.519
That's what she wanted them
to believe.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.479
What did you see when you got there?
I don't know.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.440
I called out her name and she turned
and walked towards me.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.719
And then he called to her
and she turned and she ran.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.760
He ran after her.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.959
Then I don't know.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.000
She wasn't planning to jump.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.680
I don't think so.

36:10.640 --> 36:14.559
Ange, did you even see her jump?
I don't know. I don't know any more.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.199
I don't…

36:16.200 --> 36:18.759
He pushed her. No.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.639

No. Didn't he? No!

36:21.640 --> 36:23.719
He did! No.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.360
No, I don't…

Please open the door, Becky!

50:34.680 --> 50:36.200
Stop! Stop!

51:28.640 --> 51:31.879
ELLIOT: Don't fucking say that! Do
you hear me?

51:31.880 --> 51:34.839
Don't fucking say that!
I FUCKING HATE YOU!

51:34.840 --> 51:37.000
I FUCKING HATE YOU!

51:51.760 --> 51:53.800
PHONE BUZZES

52:37.800 --> 52:42.039
What the fuck?! What the fuck?!
What the fuck?! I'm OK! It's OK!

52:42.040 --> 52:45.390
What the fuck are you doing here?
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.960
How did you find it?

52:52.200 --> 52:54.200
The same way you did.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.040
Fuck.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.480
Did you post that video?

53:14.440 --> 53:15.480
Yeah.

53:18.240 --> 53:21.359
Well, you certainly learnt
a thing or two about PR.

53:21.360 --> 53:23.400
It's a shitshow.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.400
He's in serious trouble.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.800
I just don't know
what to think any more.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.200
It's a fucking nightmare.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.840
I know.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.360
He's my friend.

54:04.600 --> 54:08.040
ELLIOT: Hey, love. I wish you
wouldn't put your phone on silent.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.279
Listen, I…I don't think
you should come tonight.

54:12.280 --> 54:14.559
I know you're not feeling
very sociable.

54:14.560 --> 54:17.679
And Liv's being a bit of a bitch
about the IVF stuff,

54:17.680 --> 54:20.319
saying something about
you can't be trusted with Noah,

54:20.320 --> 54:23.999
doubting if you'll make a good mum.
I told her I didn't want to talk about it.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.959
Also, our kid won't be
such a nightmare.

54:26.960 --> 54:29.519
Anyway, I'll see you at home later?

54:29.520 --> 54:32.320
Call me to say you got this.
I love you.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.520
I never said that. Look, I know.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.520
He told me Chloe thought…

54:45.600 --> 54:48.640
…Noah's problems were
because of my parenting.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.840
Right now, I just feel like…

54:57.520 --> 54:59.759
…everyone I've ever known

54:59.760 --> 55:02.400
might be pretending
to be somebody else.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.840
You baby-sat my kids.

55:12.640 --> 55:13.680
Sorry.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.520
There's something wrong with me.
Bullshit!

55:21.680 --> 55:23.520
You made choices.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.600
I did too. I know that.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.560
God, this place is disgusting.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.480
I've got a new phone.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.400
Thanks.
