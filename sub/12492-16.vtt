WEBVTT

00:08.280 --> 00:10.980
So we need an act for the talent show.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.450
Or we could study
for our s.A.T.S.

00:13.450 --> 00:15.120
And start checking out colleges.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.390
We do have our futures to think about.

00:17.390 --> 00:19.550
Something fresh.

00:21.290 --> 00:24.030
Hey, guys. We're just passing
through, so don't mind us.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.560
Oh, I never mind seeing you, teddy.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.730
What about me?

00:27.730 --> 00:30.070
You I mind.

00:30.070 --> 00:31.700
If you could move it along...

00:31.700 --> 00:33.670
We're trying to work on our
act for the talent show.

00:33.670 --> 00:36.240
Oh, you know,
I'm the m.C. This year.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.240
Well, I hope you don't mind second place,

00:38.240 --> 00:41.010
Because spencer and I are
doing a dance act together.

00:41.010 --> 00:42.880
Still wasting your time with spencer?

00:42.880 --> 00:46.350
Take away his good looks, his height
and his talent, and what have you got?

00:46.350 --> 00:48.450
You.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.460
I think we're done here.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.690
Man, I would love to beat that spencer.

00:55.690 --> 00:57.960
Yeah, we've got to come up
with something good.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.430
For the talent show, man.

01:00.430 --> 01:02.230
I got it.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.300
We go old school and
do a ventriloquist act.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.840
Oh, a ventriloquist is a guy
with a talking puppet, right?

01:06.840 --> 01:08.340
Right, a dummy.

01:08.340 --> 01:11.270
Oh, one small problem...
there's two of us.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.880
Although.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.810
One of us could be the dummy.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.880
- Like you.
- Or you.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.550
- Or you.

Jo, if you're gonna make fun of my
poster, I don't want to hear it.

02:28.050 --> 02:30.050
I'm not gonna make fun of your poster.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.850
I'm just gonna tell you it looks stupid.

02:32.860 --> 02:34.660
To ahead and vote for dylan.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.230
I can't vote for dylan.
He's an ear-picker.

02:38.230 --> 02:41.430
At least he's given his nose a break.

02:41.430 --> 02:45.370
You know, gabe, you're gonna
need the girl vote to win,

02:45.370 --> 02:48.270
Which, lucky for you, I can deliver.

02:48.270 --> 02:50.770
- How would you do that?
- We shoot a campaign video,

02:50.770 --> 02:52.570
Post it on the class website.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.780
And we'll put your baby sister in it.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.580
Girls go nuts over babies.

02:56.580 --> 02:59.450
I don't get it, but they do.

02:59.450 --> 03:02.450
Why do you want to help me?
I thought we were enemies.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.920
Gabe, let's not put labels
on our relationship.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.020
We both know it's complicated.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.030
No kidding.

03:10.030 --> 03:13.430
I had this dream last week where you...

03:13.430 --> 03:16.500
Yeah, it's complicated.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.280
Okay, probably something like this.

03:32.850 --> 03:33.880
Got it.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.550
Cool.
Now you do it.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.650
Okay.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.060
So?

03:46.060 --> 03:47.530
Really good,

03:47.530 --> 03:49.460
But you're not doing what I showed you.

03:49.470 --> 03:52.530
I know. I feel like it needs
something more, right?

03:52.540 --> 03:54.170
Or less.

03:54.170 --> 03:58.070
Actually I've been working on
some moves of my own, so...

04:04.380 --> 04:06.480
I call this one
"the hacky sack."

04:06.480 --> 04:08.350
Hacky hacky.

04:08.350 --> 04:11.090
Hacky hacky hacky hacky hacky sack!

04:16.230 --> 04:18.630
What do you think?

04:18.630 --> 04:22.400
What else have you got?

04:22.400 --> 04:25.970
Well...

04:25.970 --> 04:27.800
Everybody knows jazz hands, right?

04:27.800 --> 04:28.940
Right.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.410
Check out these bad boys.

04:31.410 --> 04:36.010
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow!

04:36.010 --> 04:37.750
Pow!

04:40.250 --> 04:42.020
Exploding jazz hands.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.490
Fantastic.

04:49.230 --> 04:53.500
All right, first we want to
show you as a strong leader.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.160
So act strong.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.140
How does that look?

05:02.770 --> 05:06.410
What am I looking at?

05:06.410 --> 05:10.610
Just make a fist and say,
"I will fight for you."

05:10.610 --> 05:11.810
Okay.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.450
I will fight for you!

05:13.450 --> 05:15.780
Perfect. Now let's see
the softer side of gabe...

05:15.790 --> 05:19.250
The loving brother.
Chase the kid around.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.230
Ready?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.130
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.100
Aww, the baby's absolutely adorable.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.340
People are gonna love her.

05:35.340 --> 05:38.170
Now get her out of here.

05:42.350 --> 05:45.750
Now let's meet gabe the wise leader.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.750
Okay.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.520
Should I do this?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.220
No.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.830
- Just answer these questions.
- Okay.

05:59.830 --> 06:02.230
Gabe, how would you feel
about a longer recess?

06:02.230 --> 06:04.700
I think it's a great idea.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.500
Some of the teachers think we should
have more homework. Thoughts?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.500
That's a terrible idea.

06:09.510 --> 06:11.970
The amount of homework we do now is good.

06:11.970 --> 06:15.140
And finally, new playground
rules... pro or con?

06:15.140 --> 06:19.050
I don't like them at all.
There's safety and there's fun.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.550
You can't have them both.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.550
Loving it.
Now y,

06:22.550 --> 06:24.890
"I'm gabe duncan
and I approve this message."

06:24.890 --> 06:28.960
I'm gabe duncan and I approve this message.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.230
Awesome.
We're done.

06:30.230 --> 06:31.790
You want to play a video game?

06:31.790 --> 06:33.630
Until the election

06:33.630 --> 06:36.630
I think it's best
we keep this professional.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.040
- Or you could be the dummy.
- Or you could be the dummy.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.540
- Or you could be the dummy.
- We could do this all day.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.340
We have been doing this all day.

06:46.340 --> 06:49.040
Well, I can't be the dummy

06:49.050 --> 06:51.710
'cause I'm not comfortable with you
putting your hands up my shirt.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.380
You didn't feel that way last week.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.380
When you had that itch you couldn't reach.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.920
All right, then what if we're both dummies?

06:57.920 --> 07:01.360
Fine, we're both dummies.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.760
I don't know what's been going on in here,

07:03.760 --> 07:07.200
But you two just made a breakthrough.

07:11.670 --> 07:15.600
Hey, ivy, you got a minute?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.910
You found out teddy can't dance, right?

07:17.910 --> 07:21.380
She's awful.
I don't want to embarrass myself.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.510
In front of the whole school.
What am I gonna do?

07:23.510 --> 07:25.510
You gotta tell it to her straight.

07:25.510 --> 07:27.720
Just rip the bandage off and say,

07:27.720 --> 07:30.190
"girl, you stink."

07:30.190 --> 07:32.250
You know, that kind of honesty.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.160
Might be better
coming from the best friend.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.930
You're funny.

07:37.930 --> 07:40.200
Fine.
I'll do it.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.160
I'll just be honest with her.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.300
I sprained my ankle.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.900
Oh, no.
What happened?

07:46.900 --> 07:49.340
I was trying to practice
some of your dance moves.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.340
And then I slipped.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.680
Mm, too much hacking on the sacky?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.480
Exactly.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.650
And right before the talent show.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.920
Talk about bad timing.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.220
You poor thing, come in.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.760
Have a seat.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.160
I'm gonna put your foot up.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.730
Can I get you anything?
Are you hungry?

08:16.730 --> 08:19.230
- A little.
- You know what you need?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.970
Some homemade chicken soup.

08:22.970 --> 08:27.010
Mm, chicken soup.

08:27.010 --> 08:29.410
For the chicken.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.549
Jo just put the campaign
video on the website.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.220
- You want to watch it?
- Sure, honey.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.800
How well do you really know gabe duncan?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.270
I will fight you!

08:50.270 --> 08:52.270
He hates babies.

08:55.070 --> 08:58.440
Gabe, how would you feel
if there was no more recess?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.480
I think it's a great idea.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.810
Really?

09:02.810 --> 09:05.480
And what's your opinion
about less homework?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.320
That's a terrible idea.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.820
The amount of homework we do now is good.

09:13.790 --> 09:17.460
And finally, how do you feel about girls?

09:17.460 --> 09:19.260
I don't like them at all.

09:20.430 --> 09:21.900
Gabe duncan...

09:21.900 --> 09:25.000
No recess, more homework, hates girls,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.670
Especially baby girls.

09:28.970 --> 09:32.410
I'm jo keener and I want
to be your president.

09:34.140 --> 09:38.680
I'm gabe duncan and I approve this message.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.060
Okay, I know it looks bad.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.660
But...

09:50.660 --> 09:52.690
But what?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.380
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:12.380 --> 10:16.180
You're probably wondering why I'm
running on my sprained ankle.

10:16.190 --> 10:18.920
Yeah, I kind of was.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.890
It healed.

10:21.890 --> 10:23.060
Really?

10:23.060 --> 10:25.390
Then why do you still have your crutches?

10:25.390 --> 10:29.900
Lots of good questions here.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.200
Spence, what's going on?

10:32.200 --> 10:35.000
All right, look, I faked the injury.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.940
Because there is a problem.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.970
- With what?
- With our dancing.

10:38.970 --> 10:41.940
Oh, spence, not everybody
gets the exploding jazz hands.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.350
The first time out.
It's a process.

10:44.350 --> 10:46.650
The problem wasn't me.

10:46.650 --> 10:47.880
Oh.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.020
It's no big deal.
Lots of people can't dance.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.820
And you're one of them.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.420
For your information, I'm a great dancer.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.160
- Teddy, I'm just being honest.
- Oh, like you were about your ankle?

10:58.160 --> 11:00.900
No, you know what?
I'm gonna find myself a new partner...

11:00.900 --> 11:03.130
- Someone who appreciates my talent.
- Teddy, come on.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.200
I even knitted you special
socks to keep your toes warm,

11:06.200 --> 11:09.770
'cause that's another thing
I'm good at... knitting.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.880
My class is this way.

11:20.970 --> 11:24.180
I'm so glad we decided to
forget the ventriloquist act.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.010
Yeah, what were we thinking?
Juggling is so much easier.

11:27.010 --> 11:29.150
- Okay, throw first.
- No, you throw first.

11:29.150 --> 11:35.520
- No, you throw first.
- No, you throw first.

11:38.690 --> 11:41.530
Emmett, do you want to dance
with me in the talent show?

11:41.530 --> 11:42.860
- Yes.
- Great.

11:42.860 --> 11:45.230
Let's go to the basement and rehearse.

11:45.230 --> 11:48.430
Whoa whoa, wait, emmett.
What just happened here?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.640
Teddy just asked me to dance with her.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.370
Let's not question it.

11:52.370 --> 11:54.510
So you're just leaving me hanng?

11:54.510 --> 11:57.610
Don't look at it that way.
You and I are like best buds.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.610
We've been through thick and thin together.

11:59.610 --> 12:01.850
- You know I will always
be there... - Emmett!

12:01.850 --> 12:04.150
See ya.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.720
Pow pow pow pow pow!

12:10.720 --> 12:12.930
Pow!

12:14.790 --> 12:17.500
What do you think?
And be honest.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.230
I love it.
Duh.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.740
Really? 'Cause spencer
said I was a bad dancer.

12:25.740 --> 12:27.270
Let's not talk about spencer.

12:27.270 --> 12:29.310
He's in the past.
It's emmett time.

12:29.310 --> 12:31.110
So which of my moves should we start with?

12:31.110 --> 12:34.280
Actually I'm thinking that we should
save your moves till the end.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.620
You don't start a fine meal
off with dessert, right?

12:36.620 --> 12:38.250
Right.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.120
So I'll just start dancing,
do whatever it is I do...

12:41.120 --> 12:42.920
The meat and potatoes...

12:42.920 --> 12:45.560
And then you can bring it home
with the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.790
- The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
- A little less crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.500
- The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
- A little less.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.460
- CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
- More. Right.

12:51.460 --> 12:54.970
- CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.
- There you go.

12:56.540 --> 12:59.040
Hey, how did it go today, honey?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.210
Well, one kid said he'd vote for me.

13:01.210 --> 13:04.580
Then he found his glasses
and realized I wasn't jo.

13:04.580 --> 13:08.410
We have to do something
about this jo person.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.950
You don't have to do anything.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.520
No, I do, I do,

13:11.520 --> 13:13.550
Because nobody attack my babies.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.950
Now bob, I want you
to go over to jo's house.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960
And punch her dad in the face.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.790
If he's anything like jo...
no, thanks.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.730
Once again I am the one.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.760
Who has to do the butt-kicking
around here.

13:25.770 --> 13:28.470
Honey, would you relax?
Nobody needs to kick anything.

13:28.470 --> 13:31.640
That's right.
I've got a plan and I need your help.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.540
There, you see?
He's got a plan.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.340
Yes.

13:35.340 --> 13:38.080
Would you stop stretching?
Let's go.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.080
I'm not stretching.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.650
I'm stuck.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.230
Hey, I think we can really take this thing.

13:54.230 --> 13:57.200
Look who we're up against... the
magician, the roller skaters,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.700
The stilt walker, the kid with the tuba.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.940
It's a sousaphone or as he
pronounces through his braces,

14:02.940 --> 14:04.440
Shooshaphone.

14:15.550 --> 14:19.150
That was erwin and his sousaphone,

14:19.150 --> 14:22.590
Playing, believe it or not,

14:22.590 --> 14:24.460
"party in the u.S.A."

14:28.030 --> 14:31.530
And now please welcome
the dance stylings of...

14:31.530 --> 14:34.200
Locomotion!

15:18.080 --> 15:19.710
Emmett!

15:21.250 --> 15:24.250
- Are you okay?
- Get away from me.

16:05.990 --> 16:09.030
Thank you, locomotion...

16:09.030 --> 16:11.600
And friends.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.830
And now for our next act.

16:14.830 --> 16:17.570
- Did anyone survive that?
- I'm still here.

16:17.570 --> 16:21.070
Please give it up for master ventriloquist.

16:21.070 --> 16:22.740
P.J. Duncan!

16:25.510 --> 16:28.480
Hi, everybody.
I'm p.J.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.820
This is charlie.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.420
Say hello, charlie.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.090
I was hoping to get by on cuteness.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.190
How are we doing so far?

16:50.370 --> 16:52.600
And as your president
I promise to represent you.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.470
To the best of my abilities.
I also promise to fight.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.480
For more recess and less homework.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.250
And of course, I don't hate girls.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.250
Like some candidates.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.250
Named gabe duncan.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.490
Thank you.

17:12.790 --> 17:16.329
Before I begin, I would like to say
something about this campaign.

17:16.329 --> 17:19.060
Now a lot of things
have been said about me.

17:19.069 --> 17:22.569
And even though they aren't
true, I'm okay with that.

17:22.569 --> 17:27.010
But when somebody starts
attacking my family...

17:29.580 --> 17:32.380
That's where I draw the line.

17:32.380 --> 17:35.910
Now I could stand here.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.650
And tell you who I really am,

17:38.650 --> 17:41.520
But I'd rather show you.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.630
I love all my kids equally,

17:46.630 --> 17:48.830
But if I had to pick a favorite,

17:48.830 --> 17:50.830
It would be gabe.

17:52.170 --> 17:55.530
I changed the oil in your truck, dad.

17:57.170 --> 18:00.210
Without being asked...
classic gabe.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.610
He's just so loving and so caring,

18:03.610 --> 18:06.210
Especially with his baby sister charlie.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.910
In fact, gabe was the most excited.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.150
About charlie's arrival.

18:12.350 --> 18:15.250
And he made it himself.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.760
Gabe's the kind of guy you
want to have a root beer with.

18:22.630 --> 18:25.000
We'll stay up all night if we have to,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.200
But I'm gonna make sure you pass that test.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.200
Don't you have to rescue stray animals.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.570
And find them good homes?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.340
Did that before school.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.570
Classic gabe.

18:38.210 --> 18:40.680
Gabe's not only sweet and kind,

18:40.680 --> 18:45.250
He also has an amazing fashion sense.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.990
This one...
fun and playful.

18:48.990 --> 18:52.590
This one is off the hook!

18:56.700 --> 19:01.230
And they all lived happily ever after.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.440
Mwah.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.440
Gabe duncan...

19:05.440 --> 19:07.670
Family first.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.720
Gabe, gabe, gabe, gabe!

19:35.540 --> 19:38.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.370
I just wanted to say...

19:39.370 --> 19:41.270
I know what you're gonna say.

19:41.270 --> 19:43.910
You saw the talent show and now
you want to say "I told you so,"

19:43.910 --> 19:47.110
Because you were right.
I can't dance.

19:47.110 --> 19:49.250
Actually I was going to apologize.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.250
For lying about my ankle.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.620
Oh, okay.
Go ahead then.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.720
I'm sorry for lying about my ankle.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.060
I'm sorry I lied about those socks.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.420
What?

19:59.430 --> 20:01.660
I didn't actually knit them myself.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.800
I can't knit.
Or dance.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.930
Hey, if I wanted a dancing
knitter, I'd date my aunt betty.

20:07.930 --> 20:10.170
- So we're good?
- We're great.

20:10.170 --> 20:12.170
Emmett...

20:12.170 --> 20:14.940
Get away from me!

20:21.280 --> 20:24.720
Hey, charlie. So yesterday
was the school talent show.

20:24.720 --> 20:28.590
And I hold in my hand
the winning check for $25.

20:28.590 --> 20:31.020
Which is made out to pj duncan.

20:31.020 --> 20:34.130
Yeah, the one that's based
on your cuteness, charlie.

20:34.130 --> 20:36.730
And mine.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.930
Anyway, I on the other hand owe the school.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.730
Some money for damages.

20:40.730 --> 20:43.170
And erwin said he'll "shee" me in court.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.970
So my advice is,

20:44.970 --> 20:47.840
If someone ever tells you you're
bad at something you love,

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
Don't give up.
Just make sure.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.480
You don't do it
in front of the whole school.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.150
And if I ever offer
to teach you how to dance,

20:55.150 --> 20:58.020
Well, good luck, charlie.

21:01.850 --> 21:04.060
Gabe, lunch.

21:05.830 --> 21:08.030
All clear.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.860
Gabe, really, is all this necessary?

21:12.870 --> 21:16.540
Yes, it is.
I'm the president.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.870
Of room 12.

21:17.870 --> 21:21.470
Today room 12,

21:21.470 --> 21:24.610
Tomorrow room 14.

21:24.610 --> 21:28.350
They're painting room 12,
so we're moving to room 14.

21:28.350 --> 21:30.150
Just eat your sandwich.

21:33.950 --> 21:37.060
Gabe, you got a little something on your...

21:38.560 --> 21:40.060
Oh, whoa

21:40.060 --> 21:43.500
Gabe, would you tell the secret
service man to get off your brother?

21:43.500 --> 21:47.900
Mom, what did I say
about bossing me around?

21:47.900 --> 21:49.000
Oh, you wouldn't.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.200
Take her down!

21:52.540 --> 21:55.270
How are you doing, dad?

21:56.080 --> 21:57.640
I'm fine.
