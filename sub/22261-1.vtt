Someone else was smuggling a phone inside.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.417
Shoves it up his hole.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.875
And he found a way in.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.833
Someone starts calling.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.708
Thing vibratin' off his G-spot.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.583
She sees his boner.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.792
He's so fuckin' embarrassed

03:15.083 --> 03:16.792
Best off not dealin' here, lads.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, we know.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.143
'Cause he murdered the Dixon brothers

03:19.167 --> 03:20.567
for dealing in Marigold last month.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.625
You don't read the papers, no?

03:22.708 --> 03:24.417
Parts of them were in Angle Glyn.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.750
[Cobbie] Bleeding psychopath.

03:25.833 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, you know what?

03:27.083 --> 03:29.667
We should fuckin' whack him and take over.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.083
Then we'd be the bosses.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.847
Do you think he just
walked into this game?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.583
Thirty years him and his crew
are goin' for.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.458
That fella has bodies all over.

03:37.542 --> 03:39.342

One hundred years old.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.833
All you need is a bit of
wee lads and a flash cam.

03:49.917 --> 03:52.000
Boobs like that,
they bounce all over your cock.

03:52.625 --> 03:54.545
Boobs like that bounce

03:55.125 --> 03:56.685
You're wrong you little pussy, Glenner.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.184
Just 'cause you haven't got the artillery

03:58.208 --> 03:59.375
for a woman like that.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.250
[moaning]

04:01.333 --> 04:02.875

04:19.458 --> 04:20.708

04:21.916 --> 04:25.083
[mumbling indistinctly]

04:27.792 --> 04:28.875
[door buzzing]

04:28.958 --> 04:32.125
Hey, man, I'm sick of
waitin' in line for a handout.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.292
Look at Derra and his crew.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.625
They got the flash cars, flash mots.

04:37.708 --> 04:38.750
All that shit.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.375
That could be ours.

04:40.458 --> 04:41.625
It's not that easy.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.375
Yeah, why not?

04:43.542 --> 04:46.000
All we need is a bit of start-up cash.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.667
My brother's on with Flicko.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.458
He starting to sell with some brown.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.985
Went to collect me welfare this

Yeah, there's been information,

05:12.667 --> 05:14.875
you've been working as a DJ.

05:14.958 --> 05:17.398
Your benefits have been cut off
until the team can look at it.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.917
What? It's a hobby.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.792
We only do one gig a week.

05:22.667 --> 05:23.976
[Clerk] And don't declare it income.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.292
You wanna appeal it,

05:25.375 --> 05:27.018
you can fill out the
application file on the website.

05:27.042 --> 05:28.442
That's a load of bleeding bollocks.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.643
Get the fuck outta here, Connolly,
and mind your own business.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.893
What are you evicting them for?

05:58.917 --> 06:00.268
[officer] 'Cause his junky dad
didn't pay the rent.

06:00.292 --> 06:01.792

06:17.500 --> 06:19.083
Get the boat, you tart.

06:19.167 --> 06:20.000

06:20.167 --> 06:21.333
Giddyup, go on. Go on.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.417
- Catch you later, Sarah.
- [Sarah] Bye, babe.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.708
One more and she'll be stabbin'.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.125
- Stop that.
- Who's in there?

06:28.208 --> 06:29.250
No one.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.958
Jason, put me down! Stop it.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.458
Little blue-eyed boy. Ain't ya?

06:49.458 --> 06:52.167
Really? Gonna lend?

06:54.625 --> 06:56.417
I know you got welfare today.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.708
[Jason] No, they cut me off for DJing.

07:00.042 --> 07:01.583
What are ya gonna do for money now?

07:03.875 --> 07:05.167
Don't know.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.333
Maybe I'll just spin.

07:07.625 --> 07:11.250
My friend Jared said he'd set me up
in one of the top clubs on Murbay.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.250
What about me?

07:13.708 --> 07:15.375
I'm starting college soon, Jay.

07:18.167 --> 07:20.167
I didn't say you had to go, did I?

07:24.083 --> 07:26.083
Have you got 50 or what?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.917
In the drawer, there.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.042
What do you need that for?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.250
Gigging up at the black is why.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.750
Need somethin' in me pocket.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.750
Might go, myself.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.250
Yeah?

07:50.750 --> 07:51.917

07:53.250 --> 07:55.250
Okay. See ya up there, so.

08:00.583 --> 08:01.750
You all right?

08:24.250 --> 08:25.250
Hi, kiddo.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.500

- Jay.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.417
I thought you were at Sarah's.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.208
What was Derra Murphy doing here?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.000
Just collecting.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.417
Collecting?

08:54.708 --> 08:57.292
Ma don't tell me you took a
loan off that big dirtbag?

08:57.375 --> 08:58.542
I had to, Jason.

08:58.708 --> 08:59.768
I'm up to me neck in bills here.

08:59.792 --> 09:01.272
We'd be homeless if I don't pay them.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.125
Why didn't you ask me for money?

09:03.208 --> 09:04.208
'Cause you have no money.

09:05.583 --> 09:08.375
Look. I'm gonna go to Murbay, Ma.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.500
I could earn a fortune out there DJing.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.875
It's all right.
I'm on track to pay it back.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.250
Money coming into the
credit union tomorrow.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.809
No, listen, I'm gonna to talk to Derra.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.875
- I'll solve this, all right?
- No, Jay.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.309
You stay out of this, do you hear me?

09:20.333 --> 09:21.917
I don't want you involved.

09:26.167 --> 09:28.583
[dance music playing]

09:57.250 --> 10:01.000
Hey, hey, give it up for our DJ, Jason!

10:01.083 --> 10:03.333
[all cheering]

10:12.667 --> 10:14.958
Jay, who knows what the

10:15.042 --> 10:17.208
[laughing] I'm pushin'

10:17.292 --> 10:19.042
[Jason] Relax, man.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.958
For your plate, of course.

10:23.042 --> 10:24.458
A fucking mad, crack boss.

10:24.542 --> 10:25.667
I mean fuck, lads.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.792
I can't feel me face.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.851
Hit that. Slap right there.
Nothing. Fucking nothing.

10:28.875 --> 10:29.875
How many did you take?

10:29.958 --> 10:30.958
[Dano] Three, I think.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.351
What? I told you to take one.
We have to sell the rest of 'em.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.083
Well, Micka's selling half my bag already.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.625
Loads of bleeding puntas in here.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.583

10:38.667 --> 10:40.309
What you mean "what"?
Where's the fuckin' big bag I gave you?

10:40.333 --> 10:41.667
Where's the big bag?

10:41.750 --> 10:44.708

Primrose, saved some border.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.000
Raking 'em in the car park.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.625
All right, so. You see Sarah 'round?

13:15.708 --> 13:16.792
Shut up, yourself.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.375
I just got a fuckin' break. Come on.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.292
It's everywhere you can.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.875

13:22.083 --> 13:23.458

13:23.542 --> 13:24.667
Where the fuck ya going?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.726
I'm heading over to
Blacker to meet the girls.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.125
And who's this fuckin' Nigerian?

13:28.375 --> 13:29.726
[Christina] Whacker, please, not tonight.

13:29.750 --> 13:32.292
I'm Irish born and bred,
pal, yeah, and I'm proud of it.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.042
Hey you, don't be getting fucking lippy.
Keep ya mouth shut.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.351
He's selling me a few yokes, is all.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.476
- He's selling a few of his?
- Yeah.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.917
So he's dealing on my patch?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.208
Argh!

13:41.125 --> 13:43.292
Don't ever let me catch you
selling the Primrose again!

13:43.375 --> 13:44.417
You fuckin' hear me?

13:44.500 --> 13:45.660
[Christina] Don't! Leave him.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.042
[Christina] He did nothing!

13:47.125 --> 13:48.125
Give me that.

13:48.167 --> 13:50.417
Bingo. They're mine now you
little fuckin' windbag.

13:50.917 --> 13:51.917
[Cobbie] Shit.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.833
Who wants a taste?

14:02.458 --> 14:03.875
[Kim] Smoke?

14:03.958 --> 14:05.500
Cheers.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.375
[Kim] Heard you're a dealer now.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.208
Why, you're buyin'?

14:09.750 --> 14:12.458
Ain't you married to the
biggest dealer in Darndale?

14:12.875 --> 14:14.917
No, not married.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.208
Derra doesn't want me takin' them.

14:17.292 --> 14:18.333
Okay.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.083
How many do you want?

14:22.583 --> 14:24.125
[bag crinkling]

14:24.208 --> 14:26.208
That's plenty.

14:26.292 --> 14:27.708
How much?

14:27.792 --> 14:29.708
They're on the house.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.167
Okay.

14:32.875 --> 14:33.875
Cheers.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.250
From London, are ya?

14:37.625 --> 14:40.500
I was brought up there
but my parents are Irish.

14:40.792 --> 14:44.083
We moved back here when I was 18.

14:44.167 --> 14:46.458
You're Jay Connolly, ain't ya?

14:46.625 --> 14:48.292
Jay, yeah.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.167
I knew I recognized your face.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.708
Your dad Teddy was good friends
with Derra.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.375
I remember you when you were this size.

15:00.708 --> 15:01.958
How old are you now?

15:02.042 --> 15:03.042
Twenty-four.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.208
[laughing]

15:05.500 --> 15:07.792
[Kim] You look about 30.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.125
Cheers.

15:09.292 --> 15:11.667
That's what happens when
you live around here.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.667
I'm nearly old enough to be your mother.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.042
Well, age is only a number
and you look about 30, so.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.625
That makes us even, love.

15:19.708 --> 15:23.000
You sure know how to
charm a girl, don't ya, Jay?

15:23.583 --> 15:24.750
Jay, man.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.309
Cob said they're gettin'
hopped down on Primrose.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.250
Come on, let's fuckin' go man.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.333
Go go, now!

15:32.417 --> 15:33.917
There he is, lads.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.417
[Glenner] Ah, Cobbie man, what happened?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.417
Fuckin' Marco Kelley.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.417
He bust me nose and took the big bag, Jay.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.333
That was all our yokes.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.792
I'm gonna carve his fuckin' face off, Jay.
All right?

15:48.875 --> 15:50.143
[Jason] What are you doin' with that?

15:50.167 --> 15:51.417
Get that away.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.375
Now.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.851
But Jay, man, he took everything we have.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.101
He fuckin' needs to get cut up.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.958
Get it the fuck away, now!

15:57.708 --> 15:58.875
Let's go get it back.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.958
[Dano] Come on, man.

16:02.958 --> 16:04.333
[techno music playing]

16:05.750 --> 16:06.792
Hey, wanker.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.125
You think you're hard?

16:08.208 --> 16:09.792
Right now, you and me. Come on.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.375
No fucking problem, pal.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.125
Turn him out, Jay.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.875
[Dano laughing]

16:15.958 --> 16:17.792
[Dano] Shut him up, Jay.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.458
[tyres screeching]

16:20.750 --> 16:22.833
You're a fucking dead man!

16:22.917 --> 16:24.083
[Dano] Oh shit.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.708
[gun firing]

16:26.625 --> 16:28.792
[people yelling]

16:29.333 --> 16:30.500
[gun firing]

16:38.125 --> 16:41.417
Yeah, give us a 16 inch there with ham.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.250
Cheese, paprika?

16:43.333 --> 16:45.625
Those little sprinkly
things you put on there.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.375
So the Whacker got whacked?

16:47.750 --> 16:49.208
Serves him right for running.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.708
Someone took the big bag off him, though.

16:51.792 --> 16:52.958
Let's find out who.

16:53.042 --> 16:55.792
What's that Mexican stuff you have?

16:56.208 --> 16:58.458
The green thing and it's
all hot and spicy and all.

16:58.542 --> 16:59.792
You throw that on top, will ya?

16:59.875 --> 17:01.958
Fucking jalapeños.

17:02.042 --> 17:03.208
Yeah.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.166
What you mean you won't
deliver to Darndale?

17:06.250 --> 17:07.851
I'm out there making a
bleeding masterpiece.

17:07.875 --> 17:10.208
- You're not gonna bring it to me?
- [laughing]

17:10.291 --> 17:12.750
What the fuck am I gonna have for me tea?

17:12.833 --> 17:14.583
[laughing]

17:14.833 --> 17:15.958
Oh, really?

17:17.750 --> 17:19.416
Wilson won't pay.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.000
Why not?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.541
Said he doesn't have it.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.791
That's a bleeding lie. 'Course he has it.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.333
You're too fucking soft
Cobbie, you know that?

17:27.416 --> 17:28.541
Yeah, Dano. Listen.

17:29.375 --> 17:30.750
What's the excuse?

17:30.833 --> 17:31.667
Doesn't have 'em.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.375
Said, "Jay can go fuck himself."
He's not paying you a cent.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.333
What did I say to you, Jay?

17:36.417 --> 17:38.917
Collecting payment ain't as
easy as Dano thinks it is.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.292
What you mean, not easy?

17:40.542 --> 17:43.833
Just put a hatchet to his fucking neck
then watch the little cunt pay.

17:44.458 --> 17:45.750
Who was in the gaff?

17:46.167 --> 17:48.083
Just him and his ma, we think.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.292
Jay, you can't storm this
guy in broad daylight, man.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.000
His ma and all is in the place.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.333
Too right, we can.

17:55.417 --> 17:56.833
She's a dirty smack head.

17:56.958 --> 17:58.208
My job, if it's gonna.

17:58.292 --> 18:00.292
That's the way shit runs
in this game, Glenner.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.167
You teach that little bitch
a lesson he won't ever forget.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.167
Look, Jay, leave. Forget about it.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.542
Can't let it happen again, man.

18:06.708 --> 18:07.792
No.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.542
I'll get it now, all right?

18:10.625 --> 18:11.667
Come on.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.292
Do we not need better carvers for this?

18:30.375 --> 18:32.458
I want this little shit bag
to look me in the eye.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.417
What about the pigs, Jay?

18:34.500 --> 18:37.292
Who's gonna call the pigs
in the fucking jungle?

18:37.833 --> 18:38.917
[pounding on door]

18:41.875 --> 18:42.958
Who's there?

18:43.042 --> 18:44.442
Open up, it's your son's mate, Jay.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.375
- Who?
- [Wilson] Don't open it, Ma.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.976
Just open the fucking door,
you junky bitch,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.125
or we smash it in.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.684
[Jason] Open up else or we're coming in.

18:50.708 --> 18:53.250
Listen you little bitch,
open this fucking door.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.333
[screaming]

18:54.500 --> 18:56.583
[yelling indistinctly]

18:56.750 --> 18:57.958
[Jason] Get the fool.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.000
Where's me fucking money, Wilson?

19:03.333 --> 19:05.167
I want it now. Where's the money?

19:05.250 --> 19:06.292
Don't hurt him, please!

19:06.375 --> 19:10.083
Shut the fuck up, you junky bitch,
or I'll rip the hair out your skull!

19:10.167 --> 19:11.208
Are you disrespecting me?

19:11.292 --> 19:12.934
I wasn't disrespecting you, pal.
I wouldn't do that on ya.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.018
- What'd you say to Cobbie?
- I don't remember. I was stoned.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.442
You don't remember?
You were taking a piss, you little prick.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.083
You were stoned on our brand.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.476
You want me to talk to chief
for non-payment

19:20.500 --> 19:22.140
and then your dad'll have to pay it back.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.625
No, Jay, please, his dad's in prison.

19:24.708 --> 19:25.750
I'll pay you the money.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.375
I have a little girl upstairs.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.083
I don't want her to see that.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.167
- Who's upstairs?
- Me daughter.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.375
- She's only 11.
- Glenner, go up and check.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.167
[Janice] How much did he owe ya?

19:36.333 --> 19:38.726
Look, it's not about the money, Janice.
He's disrespectin' me big time.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.393
- Here.
- Word or you'll get a little nail.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.777
[Janice] It's all the money we have.
Here, take it, take it.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.375
Don't sell it to him any more, big Jay.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.458
Shit.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.863
Give us our money. Give us that.

25:23.917 --> 25:27.833
[Dano] I danced on his head, boys, yeah?

25:27.917 --> 25:29.625
Stompin' on him, we was.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.667
And he was bawling his eyes out.

25:31.750 --> 25:32.750
Begging for his life.

25:32.833 --> 25:34.333
"Please, please, I got a family."

25:34.417 --> 25:36.375
Boom. Knocked him out cold.

25:36.458 --> 25:37.833
Cleaned the fucking place out.

25:37.917 --> 25:38.917
Didn't we, Jay?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
[laughing]

25:40.125 --> 25:42.375
And he was calm as a
bleeding daisy and all.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.625
Wasn't he Jay, yeah?

25:43.708 --> 25:44.893
[Glenner] Calm as a daisy, Dano.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.667
You're a bleedin' sap, you know that?

25:46.750 --> 25:49.143
Yeah, I guarantee it didn't
even go down like that, Jay. Did it?

25:49.167 --> 25:50.727
Didn't I go down on your ma last night?

25:50.833 --> 25:51.958
So, fuck you, anyway.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.208
All I can say is fair play, lads.

25:57.292 --> 26:00.250
Takes balls to do that. Seriously.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.250
Three grand.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.083
So much for 20 fucking Gs, Dano.

26:03.167 --> 26:04.292
Yeah, but with that, Jay,

26:04.375 --> 26:06.583
we can buy a heap of brown off Flicko.

26:07.375 --> 26:09.000
So you wanna be selling brown, Jay?

26:09.083 --> 26:10.833
[Cobbie] Why not?

26:10.917 --> 26:12.583
Tellin' you, it's bad news, man.

26:13.208 --> 26:15.292
My word of alloy, I fucking hate brown.

26:15.417 --> 26:17.750
No, seriously it's not my
negativity you're taxed with.

26:17.833 --> 26:19.625
Now, shut the fuck up. It's blood money.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.333
Ya mean good money, Glenner.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.750

26:22.833 --> 26:26.125
You whine all day like

26:26.500 --> 26:28.333

I guarantee you we would
sell more fucking CDs

26:38.833 --> 26:40.583

26:44.083 --> 26:46.000

You can get rid of 'em.

27:12.417 --> 27:15.083
[women clamouring indistinctly]

27:16.458 --> 27:19.875

Ah, yeah, I'm not fucking listening

28:42.208 --> 28:44.375
Now, come on, Maura, put this CD on.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.750
[Dano] That's a new track.
That just dropped.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.178
I have to say,
I don't mind that one better.

28:50.750 --> 28:51.958
It's a good, little track.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.125
Oh!

28:54.208 --> 28:57.208
That killer one is taking over.

28:57.292 --> 28:59.792
[dance music playing]

29:06.625 --> 29:08.417
[whooping]

29:48.375 --> 29:51.208

[Dano] Go faster, will ya?

29:54.375 --> 29:56.625

30:00.292 --> 30:02.250
Give us a shock. Get over there.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.292
Oh, for fuck's sake. Bollocks.

30:04.458 --> 30:06.101
[Dano] You fucking wench.

Why you fucking come here?

30:07.875 --> 30:08.875
Fuck's sake!

30:09.000 --> 30:11.708
Don't fucking shout at me
'cause you can't get it fucking up.

30:11.792 --> 30:13.143
It usually works, you know it does!

30:13.167 --> 30:14.542
It never fucking works for me.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.833
Shut the fuck up, will ya?

30:16.958 --> 30:18.500

See ya later, Jay.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.417
[food sizzling]

31:41.125 --> 31:43.167
[Dano] All right, Jay,

31:43.250 --> 31:44.500
Shut the fuck up, will ya?

31:44.583 --> 31:45.708
I wasn't with her.

31:45.958 --> 31:48.917
What, are you scared of Derra finding out?

31:49.042 --> 31:51.250
Snap box make it a nice one here.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.542
Let me explain something to you.

31:53.625 --> 31:57.458
In the jungle,
there's only room for one big cock.

31:57.917 --> 32:01.125
If you want to be the king,
you have to ride his missus.

32:01.875 --> 32:04.125
Says the man who couldn't
even get a hard-on last night.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.250
You fuck off.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.333
Ah, no, man, it's those bleeding yokes.

32:07.417 --> 32:08.958
Me dick shrivelled up like a raisin.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.083
Yeah, look.

32:12.333 --> 32:15.083
That little, gnarly bollocks making
damn sure not to come near us.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.958
They have our yokes, Jay.

32:17.042 --> 32:19.708
They only kept walking
'cause Micka got a slap-off.

32:19.792 --> 32:21.333
Go and get them.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.820
That there's a command on a row.
What do you want me to do?

32:24.875 --> 32:25.917
So?

32:26.500 --> 32:28.292
Want me to go and get them?

32:28.375 --> 32:29.500
- No, no.
- Are you sure now?

32:29.583 --> 32:30.667
Yeah, I'll talk to him.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.083
All right, all right. Go on then.

32:34.458 --> 32:35.833
Hey, what's up, bro?

32:38.625 --> 32:40.458
You got that bag of yokes for me, pal?

32:42.625 --> 32:43.708
What bag?

32:45.417 --> 32:48.125
The bag, you know,
that was on Whacker when you clipped him.

32:48.208 --> 32:50.667
What are you talking
about, you fucking idiot?

32:50.750 --> 32:52.250
My bro clipped no one.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.083
Well, Jay Connolly's over there

32:54.375 --> 32:56.708
and he wants his bag back, you know?

32:56.792 --> 32:58.458
Before things get heavy.

32:58.542 --> 32:59.667
What are you gonna do?

32:59.958 --> 33:02.250
He'll kick your face in
and they'll do nothing.

33:02.333 --> 33:03.667
Kick my what in?

33:09.125 --> 33:10.500
What's up?

33:10.875 --> 33:12.458
These boys won't give the bag back.

33:12.583 --> 33:15.375
Did I fucking say I
wouldn't give it back? Hmm?

33:17.458 --> 33:19.542
Just don't have it on me here and now.

33:19.667 --> 33:20.833
Where is it?

33:21.917 --> 33:23.083
It's at the cabin.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.042
I'll tell you what, Jay.

33:30.125 --> 33:34.000
You send your man around
and I'll give youse it back.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.583
That all right with you, big man?

33:37.375 --> 33:40.208
Sounds good. Come on, let's go.

33:41.583 --> 33:42.583
Go on.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.958
Cheeky little fucker.
Like to box him in, the cunt.

33:55.042 --> 33:56.458
Shut your mouth, that.

33:56.625 --> 33:58.000
I'm sick of listening to ya.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.458
What?

33:59.542 --> 34:01.167
If you're gonna do something, do it.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.309
Jay, what can I do?
The man's a fucking lunatic.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.518
He whacked Whacker for nothin'.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.000
Grow a set of fucking balls.

34:10.792 --> 34:11.809
[Sean] Is that ready, Mum?

34:11.833 --> 34:13.375
Yup, I'm just finishing up.

34:16.667 --> 34:17.708
Here.

34:19.708 --> 34:20.875
Thanks, Mum.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.333
Did you think about that course?

34:24.625 --> 34:26.042
- Yeah.
- And?

34:27.125 --> 34:29.708
I don't know. What's the point, like?

34:29.958 --> 34:33.000
The point is you need
to sort yourself out.

34:33.292 --> 34:35.684
What are you going to do, hang around here
for the rest of your life?

34:35.708 --> 34:37.833
Okay, Ma, I'll think about it.

34:41.125 --> 34:42.292
Stop, Ma.

34:51.375 --> 34:54.833
You touch this fucking car again,
you're fucking dead.

34:55.167 --> 34:57.083
I have Derra's money.

34:57.375 --> 35:01.292
I want the weekly payments with interest
and I want 200 for that window.

35:03.542 --> 35:05.458
That's everything my family owes you.

35:05.667 --> 35:08.167
Tell Derra I don't want him or you
coming near this gaff again.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.250
Where'd you get this?

35:13.917 --> 35:17.542
You're lucky I didn't
tell Derra about this.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.833
- Hello, Sarah.
- I've come for Jay.

35:22.917 --> 35:24.667
[Angela] He's in there, love.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.250
Sarah, what's up?

35:47.333 --> 35:48.875
I'm pregnant, Jay.

35:49.417 --> 35:50.542
What?

35:51.542 --> 35:52.792
You're serious?

35:53.708 --> 35:54.768
You're on the pill, aren't you?

35:54.792 --> 35:56.125
Yeah.

35:56.208 --> 35:57.448
So, how the hell did it happen?

35:57.583 --> 35:58.958
I don't know.

35:59.083 --> 36:01.283
- I think I missed a day here or there.
- Here or there?

36:09.792 --> 36:11.125
[Sarah] For fuck's sake, Jay.

36:13.375 --> 36:15.792
Sarah, wait! Sarah.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.583
Sarah.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.417
- Sarah, love.
- Leave me alone, Jay.

36:19.542 --> 36:21.125
- Hey, look.
- Go away.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.500
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

36:24.250 --> 36:26.125
I didn't mean it, I was just in shock.

36:27.042 --> 36:28.583
I'm gonna be a dad.

36:28.667 --> 36:31.208
I'm over the moon. All right?

36:31.458 --> 36:32.458
Come here.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.167
That beautiful face,
look at them little dimples.

36:36.250 --> 36:37.500
One and a half.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.500
[man] Call Tim and tell him
to get a fucking half ounce.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.750
[chattering indistinctly]

37:01.708 --> 37:04.458
[engine starts]

37:06.458 --> 37:08.250
You won't regret this, Jay, trust me.

37:08.667 --> 37:11.417
Should have done this years ago.
We'd be millionaires by now.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.917
[Jason] How would you know?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.226
[Dano] Deco used to buy gear off him

37:14.250 --> 37:16.330
before he legged it over
here to get away from Derra.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.250
Him and his younger brother, Johnny.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.292
They were nut jobs back home.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.083
These lads are big time.

37:22.167 --> 37:23.792
I don't give a fuck who they are.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.958
All right, Jay, I'm just saying.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.875
[Flicko] So, what can I do youse for?

37:30.542 --> 37:32.792
Want to buy some brown off you, Flicko.

37:34.042 --> 37:35.167
You mean tea?

37:35.375 --> 37:37.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tea.

37:37.583 --> 37:38.833
[Flicko] How much?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.500
Whatever Derra buys.

37:41.458 --> 37:44.042
I thought Derra Murphy looked
after the tea in Darndale.

37:44.417 --> 37:47.292
[Dano] I'm sure he wouldn't
mind us moving a few ounces.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.250
So, who the fuck are these two?

37:50.333 --> 37:51.667
Relax, will ya?

37:51.750 --> 37:53.893
This is Deco Collins' little brother
and his mate, Jay.

37:53.917 --> 37:54.934
They're looking for tea bags.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.250
What the fuck is Deco courting?

37:56.375 --> 37:58.055
You just let them in here out of the blue?

37:58.375 --> 37:59.476
They could be fucking
rats for all you know.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.125
No one's a fucking rat.

38:01.208 --> 38:03.458
Don't get all power on me now,
Johnny, right?

38:03.542 --> 38:05.083
You're getting too friendly, bro.

38:05.167 --> 38:07.792
What happened to the rules? No strangers.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.458
Look, I told ya, I know the lad.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.167
Now get out of the fucking room

38:13.250 --> 38:15.375
and let me do a bit of
bleeding business, all right?

38:17.750 --> 38:19.250
Sorry about that, lads.

38:19.417 --> 38:20.458
Is he all right, Flicko?

38:20.708 --> 38:22.500
Yeah, yeah, he's cool.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.018
Just gets these tantrums
every now and again.

38:24.042 --> 38:25.417
He'll be all right.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.542
Look lads, I'll do this for youse

38:29.167 --> 38:30.667
because I knew your brother, Dano.

38:30.875 --> 38:34.917
You're not to tell anybody
where you got it from.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.458
I don't want word getting
back to Derra, all right?

38:37.542 --> 38:38.750
No worries, Flicko.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.250
Yeah? Here.

38:43.083 --> 38:44.500
Appreciate this, pal.

38:47.708 --> 38:49.458
I'll get Johnny to count this.

38:49.542 --> 38:51.125
He's good with numbers.

38:51.375 --> 38:52.792
Back in a minute.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.833
I got a little problem now, Jay.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.458
What?

39:01.542 --> 39:03.292
It's not exactly two grand on the button.

39:03.750 --> 39:04.917
What do you mean?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.875
It's a few hundred short.

39:07.042 --> 39:08.518
Look, I told Jenny I would sharpen,
all right?

39:08.542 --> 39:10.101
But I had some lovely, fucking cherries.

39:10.125 --> 39:12.208
They're trying to buy 'em, man,
you know what I mean?

39:12.292 --> 39:15.208
So you spent all our money
on sessions now?

39:15.417 --> 39:17.097
Well, you took most
of the payoff to Derra.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.292
So what happens when he sees we're short?

39:19.375 --> 39:22.125
I'm just saying, nothing.
Play it cool, yeah.

39:22.792 --> 39:24.226
[Flicko] Johnny's counting
the money there, lads.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.375
Another couple of minutes.

39:26.792 --> 39:29.375
Yeah, Flicko,
Dano has got something to tell ya.

39:30.333 --> 39:31.750
Yeah? What's that, Dano?

39:37.125 --> 39:39.125
- What was supposed to be in that?
- [Flicko] What?

39:39.208 --> 39:41.048
- What was supposed to be in that?
- Two grand.

39:41.083 --> 39:42.833
Well, it's short!

39:43.250 --> 39:45.976
I told you he's a fucking rat.
Coming in here, trying to fucking rip us.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.458
Hey, I'm no fucking rat, all right?

39:47.542 --> 39:48.934
You're nothing but a dirty fucking rat!

39:48.958 --> 39:52.833
You call me a rat one more fucking time,
I'll box the head off ya.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.375
Oi, shape up, you!

39:54.458 --> 39:56.917
Let's go, girls! Come on!

39:57.000 --> 39:59.250
[yelling] Let go!

39:59.542 --> 40:00.542
Let him go.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.167
- [screaming indistinctly]
- Let him go.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.250
Get the fuck back.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.667
Get the fuck out!

40:06.875 --> 40:09.958
[both yelling indistinctly]

40:10.500 --> 40:12.750
You'll get fucking whacked Watch!

40:12.917 --> 40:14.292
Fuck off, now!

40:14.375 --> 40:16.625
Fucking ball in his hands.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.375
What was that?

40:18.458 --> 40:19.458
Relax.

40:20.333 --> 40:24.083
Now, we'll have to wait for the kid
to get back from school.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.351
Then I'll send him up to Darndale Park

40:28.375 --> 40:29.833
to meet youse later on, all right?

40:32.792 --> 40:33.912
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:36.958 --> 40:39.333
Listen, we appreciate it, Flicko.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.167
[Flicko] I can deal with him in the
future. Just let us know, yeah?

42:55.292 --> 42:56.167
Look at that.

42:56.250 --> 42:57.333
Put your fucking hand down.

42:57.417 --> 42:58.292
[Dano] A corn cob, that, bro.

42:58.375 --> 42:59.292
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

42:59.375 --> 43:00.917
What you feed that, dog food?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.833
You boys are looking awful suspicious.

43:03.042 --> 43:04.184
I think a drug search is warranted.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.375
What you reckon, Jack?

43:05.458 --> 43:06.667
[Jack] Absolutely.

43:07.458 --> 43:09.250
Get your fucking hands off me.

What's the money for, boys?

This isn't the Sheridan brothers,
are we, Jason?

Funny fucker, aren't ya?

You won't be so funny when the bailiffs
come to evict you and your ma, will ya?

43:33.375 --> 43:36.208
And we're gonna have to
confiscate this money, Jack.

43:36.292 --> 43:37.500
I think that's it, Ray.

43:37.583 --> 43:38.708
You can't do that.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.000
Who says we can't do it?

43:40.083 --> 43:41.917
We can do what we fucking want.

43:44.375 --> 43:46.375
Got a problem there, officers?

43:46.458 --> 43:48.042
Routine drug search.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.792
Have they committed an offense?

43:49.917 --> 43:51.375
Stay out of it, Sheridan.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.542
Because if they haven't,

43:53.833 --> 43:56.667
the law says it's illegal to search them.

43:56.917 --> 44:00.458
And I'm sure my solicitor will verify that
when I send them this video.

44:00.542 --> 44:01.417

44:56.208 --> 44:58.000
Where you going?

44:58.667 --> 45:00.875
I told you, I'm going
for a drink with Jenny.

45:02.125 --> 45:03.875
All right, go on, so.

45:03.958 --> 45:05.375
Have a nice night.

45:05.583 --> 45:06.667
[Kim] Okay.

45:08.792 --> 45:11.500
Dad, I need to talk to ya after dinner.

45:12.292 --> 45:13.434
Yeah, we're playing poker, like.

45:13.458 --> 45:14.726
We'll have a game of poker,
we'll shout then.

45:14.750 --> 45:16.292
I don't like poker.

45:16.500 --> 45:18.125
No, he just loves playing with his knob.

45:18.208 --> 45:20.458
[laughing]

45:21.583 --> 45:23.833
Look, don't mind them.
They're only wankers.

45:23.917 --> 45:24.917
Sit down.

45:26.875 --> 45:28.333
What's up?

45:28.625 --> 45:30.625
Remember that fella I was
telling you about? Jay?

45:30.708 --> 45:31.917
He sells the grass?

45:32.125 --> 45:33.750
I don't give a fuck about grass.

45:33.833 --> 45:35.917
He can eat the grass for all we care.

45:36.167 --> 45:39.208
Well, him and his mates
are selling brown now.

45:40.250 --> 45:41.792
- Jay who?
- Connolly.

45:43.250 --> 45:44.250
Who's that?

45:44.333 --> 45:45.583
Angela's son.

45:45.833 --> 45:47.833
Teddy, her man, topped
himself off in the lake.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.250
What's he selling?

45:51.417 --> 45:53.750
I don't know. But they're making money.

45:53.833 --> 45:55.153
That's that little bollocks I met

45:55.208 --> 45:56.667
when I was out collecting.

45:56.917 --> 45:59.000
You'll want to watch him.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.000
Tell you what you do, son.

46:02.292 --> 46:03.792
You keep an eye on this fella.

46:03.875 --> 46:07.625
He gets any big ideas,
you let me know, will ya?

46:07.917 --> 46:08.958
Can I shoot him?

46:11.750 --> 46:12.875
No.

46:19.542 --> 46:22.375
[motorcycle revs]

46:33.000 --> 46:34.833
How ya getting on?

46:35.417 --> 46:36.417
What?

46:37.333 --> 46:38.667
Don't play the fool.

46:38.750 --> 46:40.292
You're selling gear.

46:40.542 --> 46:41.750
Do you know who I am?

46:42.750 --> 46:44.167
Don't know what you're on about.

46:45.458 --> 46:46.893
My dad will bury the
whole fucking lot of youse,

46:46.917 --> 46:48.708
if he finds out you're selling here.

46:49.083 --> 46:51.167
Sean, you're what, 22 maybe?

46:51.250 --> 46:52.792
But you look about 12.

46:52.917 --> 46:54.143
Just because you look like a little bitch

46:54.167 --> 46:56.333
doesn't mean I'll spank you
like a little bitch.

46:56.875 --> 46:59.875
My dad'll blow your fucking head off,
he hears you speaking to me like that.

47:00.917 --> 47:02.875
Yeah, your dad, your dad.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.240
But you'll do nothin', will ya?

47:05.125 --> 47:06.917
Don't put your fucking hands on me.

47:07.167 --> 47:08.518
There'll be petrol bombs
thrown through every window

47:08.542 --> 47:10.292
in your fucking gaff.

47:12.250 --> 47:14.250
[Glenner] Come on, Jay. Forget about him.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.458
[Dano] Come on, fuck off.

47:23.542 --> 47:25.792
Let's get out of here, yeah?

47:25.875 --> 47:27.542
Fucking little rats.

47:31.458 --> 47:32.458
[Jason] All right, Ma?

47:32.667 --> 47:33.750
[Angela] Hey, love.

47:36.125 --> 47:37.500
Have something for ya.

47:37.625 --> 47:38.708
Yeah?

47:41.417 --> 47:42.458
What's this?

47:42.792 --> 47:43.917
[Jason] Have a look.

47:50.792 --> 47:52.272
Something you want to tell me, Jason?

47:52.458 --> 47:53.708
What, Ma?

47:54.375 --> 47:57.875
First you pay off all
my bills, and now this?

47:57.958 --> 47:59.958
I told ya, I'm doing well now.

48:01.542 --> 48:03.292
Don't tell me you're dealing.

48:03.542 --> 48:04.851
Don't bring that on us,
not after what happened

48:04.875 --> 48:06.542
with your father and the drugs.

48:06.708 --> 48:09.125
Ma, it wasn't the drugs
that killed my dad, all right?

48:09.208 --> 48:11.042
I didn't think I raised
a drug dealer, Jason.

48:11.125 --> 48:12.958
Aw, for fuck's sake,
I'm not a drug dealer.

48:13.458 --> 48:14.978
I told you, I'm getting more gigs now.

48:15.042 --> 48:16.958
- You're a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

48:17.042 --> 48:18.042
You're a liar.

48:18.083 --> 48:19.750
I'm not a liar, Ma. I'm doing well.

48:19.833 --> 48:22.042
I'm doing gigs and making money.

48:22.167 --> 48:24.708
Then swear. Swear it on his grave.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.375
I swear on my dad's grave
I'm not a drug dealer, Ma.

48:34.417 --> 48:36.000
I'm sorry, love.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.208
I never should've thought that about ya.

48:43.042 --> 48:44.042
Do you know what?

48:44.125 --> 48:46.125
You're gonna make a great father,
do you know that?

48:55.833 --> 48:57.750
Jay, I fucking love you bra,
seriously, man.

48:57.833 --> 48:59.083
Come on, will ya?

48:59.208 --> 49:00.250
I mean it.

49:00.458 --> 49:01.833
Youse looked out for me in school

49:01.917 --> 49:04.083
and I fucking appreciate it.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.417
You're welcome, bro.

49:06.667 --> 49:07.787
Feeling's mutual, all right?

49:07.833 --> 49:09.233
We're making serious cash out here.

49:09.292 --> 49:11.083
I know Dano talks a lot of shit.

49:11.417 --> 49:12.726
We don't want to go to Spain for it.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.125
We should stay here with us, man,

49:14.208 --> 49:16.292
and watch the money flow in.

49:16.417 --> 49:18.250
I'm fucking panicking.

49:19.667 --> 49:22.167
It's a relief for me, anyways.

49:23.375 --> 49:25.792
Heads up. Trouble, careful.

49:26.875 --> 49:28.792
Cosmopolitan, please.

49:31.792 --> 49:33.875
I hear you got a new car.

49:35.125 --> 49:37.625
Things are going well, yeah.

49:39.833 --> 49:42.375
You know, I can't stop thinking
about that night at Dano's.

49:44.750 --> 49:48.083
It's like we've got some
unfinished business.

49:48.167 --> 49:49.667
You're not worried about Derra?

49:50.417 --> 49:53.125
I stopped worrying
about him a long time ago.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.208
Lads are waiting.

50:05.667 --> 50:08.208
- Fucking Cobbie deal a nice grand.
- I ain't heard this.

50:08.292 --> 50:09.750
No, it's a true story.

50:09.833 --> 50:12.250
[Glenner] This fella is
sitting in the fucking local pub

50:12.667 --> 50:16.042
and the postman walked in
with a package for the barman.

50:16.125 --> 50:17.268
It delivered him on the bike.

50:17.292 --> 50:18.208
He still has his helmet on.

50:18.292 --> 50:20.708
This fella turns around, sees the dude
walking in the door,

50:20.875 --> 50:22.542
all black, black helmet on.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.667
Dives off the stool behind the bar.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.917
Pissed himself,
he literally pissed himself.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.250
- He thought he was getting assassinated.
- [laughing]

50:30.625 --> 50:34.583
Oh, boys, we're the lions
of Dublin now, look at this.

50:34.792 --> 50:36.042
This is the life!

50:36.125 --> 50:38.042
You want a shot, ladies? Shots are on me.

50:38.125 --> 50:39.042
Yeah, shots are on Dano.

50:39.125 --> 50:40.875
Jayo, you want a shot, too?

50:40.958 --> 50:41.958
[laughing]

50:42.042 --> 50:44.208
Collect that bag of yokes
off the Dempsies yet?

50:44.292 --> 50:45.292
What, what?

50:45.375 --> 50:47.792
Did you get that bag of yokes
off the Dempsies yet?

50:47.917 --> 50:49.750
- Oh, well, not yet.
- Why not?

50:50.292 --> 50:51.417
What you mean, why not?

50:51.500 --> 50:53.292
I'mma go, boys yeah, fuck off.

50:53.375 --> 50:55.042
You think I'm pricking around here, now?

50:55.125 --> 50:56.625
Getting off me face, having fun?

50:56.708 --> 50:59.042
Come here. Come here.

50:59.125 --> 51:02.083
Come here. I'm not playing
around any more, all right?

51:02.167 --> 51:05.833
- Do you understand that?
- All right, Jay, for fuck's sake.

51:07.250 --> 51:08.583
Only joking around, Jay is.

51:08.875 --> 51:10.750
I'm not fucking joking around.

51:10.833 --> 51:11.833
Do you hear me?

51:12.000 --> 51:13.160
- You f...
- I'm fucking-what?

51:13.417 --> 51:15.250
What? I'm dead fucking serious.

51:15.333 --> 51:17.293
[Dano] I'll do it, Jay.
[Jason] Do you understand?

51:17.333 --> 51:18.542
- Yeah.
- Yeah? That's it.

51:18.625 --> 51:20.333
Now shut the fuck up.

51:24.292 --> 51:26.500
Thank fucking God!

54:18.125 --> 54:21.333
Got that bag of yokes for me, then?

54:21.542 --> 54:22.625
Yokes?

54:24.167 --> 54:25.351
Bag, you know, you said in the chippy

54:25.375 --> 54:27.167
you'd give it back if I come over.

54:29.875 --> 54:33.333
Mecka, what bag
is this cunt talking about?

54:33.542 --> 54:35.458
I don't fucking know.

54:36.583 --> 54:37.684
He's a wee half man, isn't he?

54:37.708 --> 54:39.167
Aye.

54:39.250 --> 54:42.875
The bag was on Whacker
and you fucking whacked him, yeah?

54:42.958 --> 54:43.958
Whacked?

54:45.042 --> 54:47.292
Who the fuck did I whack?

54:47.542 --> 54:49.309
Are you going around saying
I fucking murdered someone,

54:49.333 --> 54:51.167
you daft cunt?

54:51.250 --> 54:52.893
You've been talking to
the guards, haven't ya?

54:52.917 --> 54:55.333
I can fucking smell it on ya.

54:56.792 --> 54:58.958
Where's your fucking bodyguard, eh?
Where's Jay?

54:59.042 --> 55:01.708
Look, an owt, just connected.

55:01.792 --> 55:04.750
You can fuck with me if you want,
but not with Jay, all right?

55:06.917 --> 55:09.083
I can fuck with ya, can I?

55:09.417 --> 55:12.875
Fucking needle dick! [laughs]

55:12.958 --> 55:14.708
Don't you fucking touch those pants.

55:14.917 --> 55:16.726
You pull those up
and I'll chop your fucking cock off.

55:16.750 --> 55:19.333
Now walk out, fucking walk out.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.750
[laughing]

55:26.750 --> 55:28.583
- See ya, Dano.
- Yes.

55:39.667 --> 55:41.208
[Sarah] Where is he?

55:41.542 --> 55:43.375
Sarah, I was trying to...

55:43.458 --> 55:44.583
What the fuck?

55:44.750 --> 55:46.083
Stop it! Stop it!

55:46.167 --> 55:48.542
You were in a club last night
with Derra Murphy's bird.

55:48.625 --> 55:49.833
Sarah, who told you that?

55:49.958 --> 55:51.875
Roisin, she saw youse together.

55:51.958 --> 55:53.208
[Jason] Roisin's a little liar.

55:54.208 --> 55:56.417
[Sarah] Don't lie to me,
Jason, don't even lie to me!

55:56.792 --> 55:58.167
Were you with her?

55:58.250 --> 56:00.333
Look, Sarah, honestly, I wasn't with her.

56:00.417 --> 56:01.333
We're finished, Jay.

56:01.417 --> 56:02.958
I don't want to see you ever again.

56:07.958 --> 56:09.375
Is it true, Jason?

56:09.458 --> 56:10.458
Aw, Sarah.

56:14.708 --> 56:15.917
Sarah!

56:16.083 --> 56:18.583

57:21.083 --> 57:23.708
Don't know what the fuck
Jay was thinking, man.

57:23.792 --> 57:25.167
Stinky binder.

57:25.250 --> 57:27.042
It's fucking Jay, what do you think?

57:27.375 --> 57:29.333
Shit, think if Derra finds out.

57:29.417 --> 57:31.250
Exactly, if Derra finds out.

57:31.458 --> 57:32.958
Derra's not gonna do nothing.

57:33.250 --> 57:34.792
We all stick together, you know?

57:34.875 --> 57:36.143
You sound like fucking Dano now,

57:36.167 --> 57:37.792
he's not gonna do nowt.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.893
You're listening to him too
much, man, I'm telling ya.

57:39.917 --> 57:40.917
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.167
Look at that. Look at
what I made in a few days.

57:43.375 --> 57:44.792
Look at that watch.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.708
Fresh cob, girls when we want,
sessions when we want,

57:48.792 --> 57:50.208
drugs when we want.

57:50.292 --> 57:53.083
Fuck, you can even get your round finished
with that few quid.

57:53.167 --> 57:54.375
I want the dessert.

57:54.833 --> 57:56.958
Treat yourself well.

57:57.042 --> 57:58.875
Yeah, your watch is ugly, I can see.
Carry on.

57:58.958 --> 58:00.542
Yeah, yeah. Don't be jealous.

58:04.250 --> 58:05.417
Wake up, wake up, Jay!

58:05.500 --> 58:06.583
What's up?

58:06.667 --> 58:08.000
Those fucking Dempsies, Jay.

58:08.083 --> 58:08.917
What happened?

58:09.000 --> 58:10.520
I went to go fucking get the bag back.

58:10.708 --> 58:13.208
Evers wouldn't hand it over
and he bleedin' jocked me, Jay,

58:13.292 --> 58:15.643
jocked me in front of everyone.
Everyone was fucking laughing at me.

58:15.667 --> 58:17.387
Well, you shut up and get in there,
will ya?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.167
[laughing]

58:35.625 --> 58:38.125
[engine revs]

58:43.958 --> 58:44.958
Fuck!

58:50.542 --> 58:53.042
[engine revs]

59:00.042 --> 59:01.208
Put it down!

59:04.125 --> 59:05.792
Put it fucking down.

59:06.917 --> 59:08.833
[engine revs]

59:16.333 --> 59:18.167
[shouting indistinctly]

59:25.875 --> 59:28.125
Come on, take it all!
I'm fucking sorry, Jay!

59:36.958 --> 59:39.875
Oh, that's some good green, boys.

59:41.917 --> 59:44.750
[engine sputters]

59:48.125 --> 59:49.917
My dad wants to talk to you, Jason,

59:50.000 --> 59:51.833
about your little drug empire.

59:52.167 --> 59:53.208
What are you on about?

59:54.083 --> 59:55.483
Just be at me gaff at four o'clock.

59:55.958 --> 59:57.250
Fuck off, you little whipper.

59:58.167 --> 59:59.667
Be there or else, Jay.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.208
Fuck that little queer.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.333
I knew this was gonna
happen sooner or later.

01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:13.417
No, we'll bleedin'
walk there and take over.

01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:16.833
You agree, Jay? It won't be long
before he gets one of us.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:18.268
What are you two muppets on about?

01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:20.875
He's not gonna be whacking anyone.

01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:23.292
What are you gonna do, Jay?

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.375
I'll meet him, see what he wants.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.833
Can't go to that meeting, Jay,
not without being strapped, at least.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.692
He wouldn't invite me over
to his gaff just to get rid of me.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.184
I'll see youse after I meet him, yeah?

01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.500
I'm telling ya, don't go to
that meeting, Jay.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.542
Dano's talking sense for a change, Jay.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:41.250
That meeting is a bad idea, man.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:13.167
Jay, what are you doing here?

01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:15.125
Derra called me over.

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:16.833
- Why?
- No idea.

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:19.917
You all right?

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:21.292
Yeah.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:24.792
Yeah, he's in the back garden.

01:01:24.917 --> 01:01:26.583
Go straight through.

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:46.708
I had this dog 13 years.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:50.458
Like a child to me.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.958
This morning, the van runs over its head.

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.250
Crushed his little skull to pieces.

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:00.583
Sorry to hear about that.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:02.667
No need for you to be sorry.

01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:05.500
The driver's gonna be sorry.

01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:07.750
Where you gettin' that gear from?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.375
Can't tell ya.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.300
My man likes to keep
things low-key, you know?

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:12.458
His business is private.

01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:19.250
Have a seat.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.417
I've been selling gear
in Darndale for 30 years.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:38.292
A few years ago, my best mate
stole a couple of ounces on me.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.875
So you know what I did?

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.792
I blew his fucking kneecaps off.

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:47.583
Now, you know why I'm telling you this?

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:50.917
'Cause if I blew off
my best mate's kneecaps,

01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:55.042
what do you think I'm going to do
to some yofler going around selling gear

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:57.167
trying to make a fool of me?

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.018
I'm not trying to make a fool out of you.

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:01.083
Just trying to help me family out.

01:03:01.417 --> 01:03:02.542
Oh, yeah.

01:03:03.667 --> 01:03:05.309
Yeah, you've a child on
the way with young Sarah,

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:06.833
isn't that it?

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:08.458
Congratulations.

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:12.500
I was best mates
with your dad, did you know that?

01:03:13.042 --> 01:03:15.125
I heard something like that.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.958
Used to go robbing cars together.

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:21.958
Then I got into selling gear
and he got into using it.

01:03:22.208 --> 01:03:24.083
Ran a big, hefty bill on me.

01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:27.375
Tried to warn him.

01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:29.875
But there's no talking
to a fucking addict, is there?

01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:31.458
Yeah, well, I'm no addict.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:34.292
I'll do whatever it takes
to look after my family.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:35.458
Okay.

01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:37.667
I respect that.

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:42.042
So here's what I'm gonna do.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:44.625
I'm gonna let you sell on Buttercup.

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.792
But you're gonna buy off me.

01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:49.375
You're gonna give me 30%

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.667
of everything you make
like everybody else does.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:54.708
And I want the name of your supplier.

01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:01.792
I'm giving you a way out, son.

01:04:03.167 --> 01:04:04.667
Take it.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:07.917
You won't be living in Buttercup
for very long.

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:09.732
In fact, you won't be living at all.

01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:15.375
Don't fuckin' move.

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:17.333
Here's how it's gonna go down.

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:20.208
I'm gonna buy whatever the fuck I want,
sell to whoever I want,

01:04:20.292 --> 01:04:21.812
and you're gonna do fuck all about it.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:25.042
[laughing]

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:32.208
You're nothing
but a bleeding cardboard gangster.

01:04:32.292 --> 01:04:34.542
[laughing]

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.559
You want this
in your fucking mouth, do ya?

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.292
No, what'd he say. If you pull it, use it.

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:42.125
You little fucking wimp, ya.

01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:44.542
Get the fuck out of this gaff.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.042
We're gonna get ya.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.333
That's a fucking head case.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.042
He pulled that thing out on you, Derra?

01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:52.167
He's just trying to act hard, that fella.

01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:53.583
Let me plug him, Dad.

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:55.250
Please.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:56.917
Ya hear him?

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.708
You couldn't plug
a bleedin' television set in,

01:04:59.792 --> 01:05:01.042
for fuck's sake.

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:03.375
[laughing]

01:05:04.542 --> 01:05:06.292
That's a very sinister plan.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:14.500
Here's another one.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:16.458
- Yeah, what you want?
- Two.

01:05:23.625 --> 01:05:25.792
Yeah, there's that
whacked man with the look.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:28.667
You get the fuck outta here,
before I break ya.

01:05:30.083 --> 01:05:31.167
Fucking smack heads, man.

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:35.958
Hey, Murphy!

01:05:36.042 --> 01:05:39.333
In there? Kim, are you fucking in there?

01:05:39.417 --> 01:05:40.708
I know you're in there.

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:42.875
You're out there riding my fella?

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.417
Jason Connolly, haven't ya?

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.042
Did you all hear that?

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:51.667
Kim Murphy's out there riding
my fella, Jason Connolly.

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:52.917
Do you know what?

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.792
You can fucking have him, you dirty slag!

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.000
- How are you, Jay?
- All right.

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:10.250
- What are you looking for?
- Just the one.

01:06:12.417 --> 01:06:13.893
Shall we go on a session this weekend?

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:15.877
If I'm not recording
my new album, I'll come down.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.480
Can I get a listen to that, actually?

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.792
Thought you got told already.

01:06:28.875 --> 01:06:30.792
Who's your daddy after today, huh?

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:32.792
The fuck you gonna do?

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:34.250
What the fuck?

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:41.917
Jay, come on quick, it's Cobbie!

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.500
Come on, quick! There, Cobbie!

01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:50.167
Fuck out of the way!

01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:52.708
Cob, man.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:53.958
Fuck.

01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:57.250
- You okay, man? Please, listen to me.
- Jay, fucking do something.

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.167
Cobbie, please.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.958
Call an ambulance, Dano.

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.000
Dano, call the fucking ambulance!

01:07:04.042 --> 01:07:06.292
Cobbie, Cobbie, wake up.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.500
[crying]

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:16.833
[Derra] You must love
to make a show of me, do ya?

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:34.083
How the fuck is he?

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.458
Is he fucking dead?

01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:38.042
Oh, so you finally showed your face.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.130
He was fucking laying there,
wasn't he, Glenner?

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:41.292
[Glenner] Answer me, Jay.

01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:43.375
Yeah, he's dead.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.500
[Glenner] Who killed him?

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:48.000
Why, what will you do, Glenner?

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.851
You'll do fucking nowt, you useless fuck.

01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:51.667
Oh, yeah? This is your fucking fault.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:53.390
You're the reason we're involved in this!

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:55.208
You're the reason!

01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:56.792
Get the fuck back, the two of ya!

01:07:56.875 --> 01:07:58.958
Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.875
It was Sean Murphy, okay?

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.542
Who the fuck else would it be?

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:12.125
What are you gonna do, Jay?

01:08:12.208 --> 01:08:15.167
We're gonna grab him
outside his pa's gaff.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.667
Bring him somewhere.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.917
And blow his fucking head off, yeah?

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:29.167
You sure you want to do this, Jay?

01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:32.042
Fucking course, he is.

01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:34.350
What, we just let him get away
with killing our best fucking mate?

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.625
Is that it, Glenner?

01:08:35.832 --> 01:08:39.875
Look, Glenner, just get the fuck out, man.

01:08:39.957 --> 01:08:40.957
We don't need you.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:46.292
No, Sean deserves to get it. I'm in.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.832
- Are you sure?
- I'm fucking sure. I'm in.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:50.667
Let's go.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.792
Jason?

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:01.750
Jason, Jason, what are you gonna do?

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.542
You're not going to do nothing stupid, eh?

01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:05.309
I didn't raise you like that, Jason.

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:06.875
Not now, Ma.

01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:09.332
Well, if you do something bad,
it'll come back at ya.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.707
Do you hear me?

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:14.707
All right, Jason?

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:17.582
Letter from the bailiff.

01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:19.475
You and your mother have
to be out of the property

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.667
in seven days.

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.707
Yeah, and by the time you take the house,

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:26.917
I'll be living up in Marabel like a king.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.582
Yeah, dream on, Connolly.

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:45.292
[Dano] There he fucking is!

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:46.917
Go, go, go, go!

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:56.708
[yelling indistinctly]

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.417
Get it moving!

01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:39.542
[Sean] My dad's gonna fucking kill youse.

01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:41.768
[Glenner] Your dad's never gonna
find you or your bones.

01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:42.934
[Sean] I didn't mean to kill him.

01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:44.042
[Dano] Changing your tune.

01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:47.292
Not so fucking hard now, are ya?

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:49.292
[Sean] Let me fucking go!

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.125
[Glenner] Shut your mouth, will ya?

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:01.500
[Dano] Down the hill! Move!

01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:08.583
[Jason] All right with you.

01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:10.833
[Sean] Jay, I'm sorry.

Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.333
Please, Jay, man, I beg ya.

01:11:19.417 --> 01:11:20.583
I'm too young to die.

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:21.792
[Jason] So was Cobbie.

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.250
[Sean] I know.

01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:25.125
[Glenner] Jay, think
about this for a minute.

01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:27.458
[Dano] He's out there killing
our best fucking mate.

01:11:28.625 --> 01:11:31.125
[Sean crying] I'll tell him
to stop all this for you.

01:11:31.292 --> 01:11:33.625
Just give me one chance.

01:11:34.417 --> 01:11:36.017
[Dano] Don't fucking listen to him, Jay!

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.000
Blow his head off, now.

01:11:38.958 --> 01:11:40.458
[Sean] Don't kill me.

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:43.542
Because if my dad finds out,
he'll come after you, Jay.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.333
And he's gonna find out.

01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:49.917

What's the story?

01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:54.833
He was seen being pulled into a car
by fucking Jay Connolly.

01:12:54.958 --> 01:12:55.958
I fucking knew it.

01:12:56.458 --> 01:12:57.583
Did you go in the house?

01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:58.833
Nobody there.

Now he's gonna meet little Spaniards.

01:20:02.708 --> 01:20:04.042
One last chance, that's it.

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:06.542
