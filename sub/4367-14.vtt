00:01.813 --> 00:04.198
You are being watched.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.434
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.436 --> 00:10.738
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.157
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.159 --> 00:15.025
but it sees everything...

00:15.027 --> 00:18.162
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.164 --> 00:21.799
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.801 --> 00:23.367
We don't.

00:23.369 --> 00:27.555
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:27.557 --> 00:30.141
You will never find us.

00:30.143 --> 00:32.343
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.345 --> 00:35.479
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:41.971 --> 00:45.106
Hey, yo, pick right,
pick right.

00:45.108 --> 00:47.608
Your mama just called, Opie,
told me to take you to school.

00:47.610 --> 00:50.878
Yeah, did you get
your popcorn ready, man?

00:50.880 --> 00:54.315
'Cause I'm
about to put on a show.

00:54.317 --> 00:56.083
- Oh, yes!
- Hell, no.

00:56.085 --> 00:57.368
You might have blocked that
if you hadn't tripped

00:57.370 --> 00:58.836
on your skirt, Bigfoot.

00:58.838 --> 01:00.338
You lucky you're funny.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.590
You said our latest number
dropped out of college?

01:02.592 --> 01:05.710
Logan Pierce left Caltech
after his sophomore year, yes.

01:05.712 --> 01:07.712
He had other aspirations.

01:07.714 --> 01:10.297
No layups, no layups.
Get that weak stuff out of here.

01:16.022 --> 01:17.355
No way, son, that was a foul.

01:17.357 --> 01:19.757
Ain't no fouls out here.

01:19.759 --> 01:22.226
Guessing it wasn't to become
a professional athlete.

01:22.228 --> 01:24.311
Been real.

01:24.313 --> 01:27.431
I gotta jet though.
I got a date with your girl.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.816
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

01:28.818 --> 01:30.568
Make it rain!

01:32.739 --> 01:35.740
Later, bitches!

01:36.625 --> 01:39.109
Who the hell is this guy?

01:41.280 --> 01:44.215
Pierce is not just
a college dropout.

01:44.217 --> 01:48.952
He's a self-made billionaire
with a genius IQ.

01:48.954 --> 01:52.456
Started
a social networking site

01:52.458 --> 01:54.125
called friendczar.com

01:54.127 --> 01:56.127
with his best friend
from college.

01:56.129 --> 01:58.679
Thought you invented
social networking, Finch.

01:58.681 --> 02:00.398
Pierce perfected it.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.435
His site has just shy
of a billion users.

02:04.437 --> 02:06.237
Pierce's Chief Engineer

02:06.239 --> 02:08.138
and Front Man
for friendczar.com,

02:08.139 --> 02:13.527
his longtime business partner
Justin Ogilvy

02:13.529 --> 02:16.414
is the money
and marketing guru.

02:16.416 --> 02:17.665
And they started
the company together?

02:17.667 --> 02:19.350
That's right.

02:19.352 --> 02:22.203
It would certainly not be
in Ogilvy's best interest

02:22.205 --> 02:23.871
to have Pierce
turn up dead now.

02:23.873 --> 02:27.458
They're taking Friendczar
public in 72 hours.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.594
We need ears on Pierce.
I couldn't clone his phone.

02:30.596 --> 02:32.179
Wouldn't matter if you could.

02:32.181 --> 02:34.048
Pierce changes phones
twice a day

02:34.050 --> 02:36.934
to avoid corporate espionage.

02:36.936 --> 02:38.636
Looks like he's supposed
to attend

02:38.638 --> 02:40.004
a charity auction tonight.

02:40.006 --> 02:42.056
Promised the press
a sound bite.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.307
And your plan is?

02:43.309 --> 02:45.342
Classic black,

02:45.344 --> 02:48.946
satin notch lapel,
bespoke, of course.

02:48.948 --> 02:52.149
And I assume you know
how to tie one of these?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.430 --> 03:06.864
You following up
on the anonymous tip?

03:06.866 --> 03:08.299
Yeah.

03:08.301 --> 03:09.633
You really think
a cop killed Davidson?

03:09.635 --> 03:11.385
I think a lot of cops
have reason

03:11.387 --> 03:13.170
to want an IAB detective dead.

03:13.172 --> 03:17.207
Then I realized
Davidson wasn't the only cop

03:17.209 --> 03:19.176
who went missing last year.

03:19.178 --> 03:21.312
Detective Stills.

03:21.314 --> 03:23.547
Didn't you two
work together in the 51st?

03:23.549 --> 03:25.048
Long time ago.

03:25.050 --> 03:28.385
Two cops go missing,
their bodies never found.

03:28.387 --> 03:31.355
Something's not right.

03:34.994 --> 03:36.861
- Carter.
- Detective.

03:36.863 --> 03:38.662
I'm emailing you the details

03:38.664 --> 03:41.999
of several lawsuits
involving Logan Pierce.

03:42.001 --> 03:44.451
Plaintiffs with a history
of violence,

03:44.453 --> 03:45.636
prior convictions.

03:45.638 --> 03:47.404
Uh, what exactly did you mean

03:47.406 --> 03:49.423
by "several lawsuits"?

03:49.425 --> 03:51.125
200, but I've already
prioritized them.

03:51.127 --> 03:52.510
And no, there's no need
to thank me.

03:52.512 --> 03:55.045
Ugh.

04:02.504 --> 04:04.905
Bear.

04:04.907 --> 04:07.591
<i>Go get it.</i>

04:11.596 --> 04:13.230
<i>Go get it.</i>

04:15.318 --> 04:18.536
I'm, uh, feeling
a little out of place here.

04:18.538 --> 04:20.404
Don't worry, I'll talk you

04:20.406 --> 04:23.908
through any difficult encounters
that may arise.

04:32.784 --> 04:34.418
Finch, I got eyes on Pierce

04:34.420 --> 04:36.286
and his partner Justin Ogilvy.

04:36.288 --> 04:38.556
Best friends for over a decade.

04:38.558 --> 04:40.724
They've known each other
since Caltech.

04:40.726 --> 04:42.927
Who's the third guy
in Pierce's circle?

04:42.929 --> 04:46.063
That would probably be
Jeremy Campbell,

04:46.065 --> 04:47.932
Pierce's lawyer.

04:47.934 --> 04:50.634
Friendczar is his firm's
only client.

04:50.636 --> 04:53.470
So I wake up,
I'm bruised, I'm scratched.

04:53.472 --> 04:56.106
I call Justin
from her dorm room.

04:56.108 --> 04:58.242
Yeah, no hello,
no good morning.

04:58.244 --> 05:00.644
Just, "Justin,
I think I got beat up

05:00.646 --> 05:03.146
- by a girl in bed and..."
- I did.

05:03.148 --> 05:05.282
"I think
I kind of enjoyed it."

05:05.284 --> 05:06.533
I loved it.

05:06.535 --> 05:08.035
Remember that
you're John Wiley,

05:08.037 --> 05:09.653
hedge fund manager.

05:09.655 --> 05:11.989
What about John Rooney,
asset manager?

05:11.991 --> 05:13.424
No, no,
he's a single-digit millionaire.

05:13.426 --> 05:16.043
John Wiley is valued
at over 100 million.

05:16.045 --> 05:20.431
Exactly how much money
do you have?

05:20.433 --> 05:22.299
Uh-oh.

05:22.301 --> 05:25.269
Pierce, Justin.
You're both looking rich.

05:25.271 --> 05:29.440
Ben, you are looking... mature.

05:29.442 --> 05:31.058
Hey.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.310
I feel a cold coming on.

05:33.312 --> 05:35.012
But wait,
isn't your little charity thing

05:35.014 --> 05:37.398
working on a cure for that?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.516
You're thinking of cancer.

05:39.518 --> 05:41.735
Ben and Cynthia Kamin,

05:41.737 --> 05:45.706
whose social networking site
connectroid.com

05:45.708 --> 05:49.493
was devalued by half
when Friendczar debuted.

05:49.495 --> 05:52.713
Kamin's pretending
to make nice.

05:54.466 --> 05:56.967
Finch, I think Pierce
just made me.

05:56.969 --> 05:59.386
Just mention
the carried interest loophole.

05:59.388 --> 06:00.421
You'll be fine.

06:02.058 --> 06:03.590
I haven't seen you
at one of these things before.

06:03.592 --> 06:04.758
What's your story?

06:04.760 --> 06:07.645
John Wiley, hedge fund manager.

06:07.647 --> 06:10.347
How's that carried interest
loophole treating you?

06:10.349 --> 06:12.816
I'm sorry.
I thought you were interesting.

06:12.818 --> 06:15.436
My mistake.

06:15.438 --> 06:16.937
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:16.939 --> 06:18.989
please take your seats
for the auction portion

06:18.991 --> 06:20.324
of tonight's event.

06:20.326 --> 06:22.326
I didn't make
a good first impression.

06:22.328 --> 06:23.610
Only because I didn't realize

06:23.612 --> 06:25.062
that we were dealing
with a one percenter

06:25.064 --> 06:27.164
who finds
other one percenters tedious.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.083
We'll start the bidding tonight

06:29.085 --> 06:31.618
with our most coveted item,
a collection of letters

06:31.620 --> 06:33.871
handwritten by Albert Einstein.

06:33.873 --> 06:36.507
We'll start the bidding
for the letters at $1 million.

06:36.509 --> 06:38.542
Who will start at $1 million
for our opening bid?

06:38.544 --> 06:41.512
$1 million right here.
Looking for 1.5.

06:41.514 --> 06:43.130
I've got $1 million,
looking for 1.5.

06:43.132 --> 06:44.264
1.5 in the back,
looking for 2.

06:44.266 --> 06:45.966
1.5 looking
for $2 million.

06:45.968 --> 06:48.085
I've got 1.5. I need
$2 million for these letters.

06:48.087 --> 06:49.803
Kamin's bidding against Pierce.

06:49.805 --> 06:51.055
$2 million, anyone?

06:51.057 --> 06:54.641
$2 million right here,
looking for 2.5.

06:54.643 --> 06:57.111
$2,501,000 right here,
looking for 3.

06:57.113 --> 06:59.262
You know, I think these letters

06:59.264 --> 07:02.116
are worth much more
than a piddly 3 mil.

07:02.118 --> 07:04.935
You could do better.
Am I right, Kamin?

07:04.937 --> 07:06.487
5 million.

07:06.489 --> 07:10.657
We've got $5 million,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:10.659 --> 07:13.377
That's too rich
for Kamin's blood.

07:13.379 --> 07:16.446
Anybody else?

07:16.448 --> 07:18.582
Hmm?

07:18.584 --> 07:20.501
I'm so sorry, Finch,
but this guy

07:20.503 --> 07:22.786
is too used to getting
his own way.

07:22.788 --> 07:24.638
10 million.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.090
$10 million,
ladies and gentlemen!

07:26.092 --> 07:27.641
We've got $10 million
going once.

07:27.643 --> 07:29.676
Mr. Reese,
this is not petty cash.

07:29.678 --> 07:32.396
We've got 10 million
going twice.

07:32.398 --> 07:34.598
Sold, right there to
the gentleman for $10 million.

07:41.356 --> 07:44.825
I'm sorry.
Maybe next time.

07:44.827 --> 07:46.243
No apology necessary.

07:46.245 --> 07:48.779
I was just driving up
the price for charity.

07:50.750 --> 07:51.815
Well...

07:51.817 --> 07:54.752
Excuse me.

07:57.539 --> 07:59.289
Finch, Pierce just got a text.

07:59.291 --> 08:02.843
He's on the move.

08:07.098 --> 08:10.100
- Get your ass in here.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:14.189 --> 08:17.474
I thought you had a cold.

08:22.113 --> 08:24.815
Pierce is not just encroaching
on Kamin's business.

08:24.817 --> 08:26.617
He's encroaching on his wife.

08:26.619 --> 08:28.068
Oh, dear.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.620
Where is Mr. Pierce?

08:29.622 --> 08:31.238
I know Pierce and I
were supposed to give you

08:31.240 --> 08:33.123
a sound bite in time
for the 11:00 news,

08:33.125 --> 08:35.525
but he's indisposed
at the moment.

08:35.527 --> 08:37.160
The one tip I can give you

08:37.163 --> 08:38.544
is that the Friendczar IPO

08:38.547 --> 08:40.363
will break records
and make history.

08:40.365 --> 08:42.198
- Thanks.
- Is Pierce avoiding us?

08:42.201 --> 08:43.717
How many shares
are you planning to sell?

08:43.719 --> 08:45.419
The board knows
Pierce only listens to you.

08:45.421 --> 08:47.504
Get him to pull himself
together.

08:47.506 --> 08:50.874
Get this company
some good press.

08:50.876 --> 08:52.810
That's Sinclair Melbourne,

08:52.812 --> 08:55.095
VC and chairman
of the Friendczar board.

08:55.097 --> 08:56.897
This was a one-time slipup,
Sinclair.

08:56.899 --> 08:59.183
It won't happen again.

08:59.185 --> 09:01.435
Sir, your letters.

09:01.437 --> 09:05.355
Ah.
You can keep 'em.

09:08.443 --> 09:12.062
Finch, Pierce just
left the auction,

09:12.064 --> 09:13.247
but his car's not here.

09:13.249 --> 09:14.448
Pierce is gone.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.900
What?
He has no mode of transport.

09:19.872 --> 09:21.905
Is that a helicopter?

09:21.907 --> 09:23.257
It's against the law
to take off

09:23.259 --> 09:26.426
from a rooftop in Manhattan.

09:26.428 --> 09:29.680
Finch, how do we keep up with
a guy who breaks all the rules?

09:47.264 --> 09:49.065
I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

09:49.067 --> 09:50.566
I turned off my phone.

09:50.568 --> 09:52.101
I'm working
on a new heuristic algorithm.

09:52.103 --> 09:56.222
Harold.

09:56.224 --> 09:59.742
Something happened
this morning.

10:04.064 --> 10:05.748
Current estimates
for casualties

10:05.750 --> 10:08.501
from both attacks
are very grave,

10:08.503 --> 10:10.653
estimated at about 200...

10:10.655 --> 10:13.840
Was it a plane?

10:13.842 --> 10:16.175
Two planes.

10:16.177 --> 10:18.911
Countless bodies
have yet to be uncovered

10:18.913 --> 10:20.463
because they
are buried under about...

10:20.465 --> 10:22.165
In terms
of civilian casualties...

10:22.167 --> 10:25.735
We started IFT
to change the world.

10:25.737 --> 10:28.971
Our suits got nicer,

10:28.973 --> 10:31.507
our scotch more expensive.

10:31.509 --> 10:35.144
We changed, but the world
stayed the same...

10:35.146 --> 10:38.114
until today.

10:41.402 --> 10:42.819
If we don't change the world,

10:42.821 --> 10:47.457
someone else will, so...

10:47.459 --> 10:51.444
what are we gonna do to stop
the guys who did this?

11:05.676 --> 11:07.176
Finch, looks like
our billionaire

11:07.178 --> 11:09.178
might be having a breakdown.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.963
Pierce appears to be
even more erratic

11:10.965 --> 11:12.265
than your typical billionaire.

11:12.267 --> 11:13.616
Nice legs.

11:13.618 --> 11:15.017
The closest thing
he has to a routine

11:15.019 --> 11:17.437
is a weekly visit
to a dry cleaner.

11:17.439 --> 11:19.272
- Where are you?
- I'm at work.

11:21.476 --> 11:24.077
Hmm. Where's Pauly?

11:24.079 --> 11:27.697
He got a full scholarship
to the Brooklyn Law Center.

11:27.699 --> 11:32.085
So I guess you will be needing
my ticket then.

11:32.087 --> 11:34.036
Did you use the, uh--

11:34.038 --> 11:38.424
CO2 process, yes,
of course, Mr. Pierce.

11:38.426 --> 11:39.842
I guess you ran out
of clean suits.

11:39.844 --> 11:41.594
Yeah.

11:41.596 --> 11:43.045
I'm actually more
of a jeans and t-shirt

11:43.047 --> 11:44.330
kind of guy.

11:44.332 --> 11:45.681
I only have one suit.

11:45.683 --> 11:49.185
A good suit is like
the perfect woman.

11:49.187 --> 11:52.972
Once you find the right one...

11:52.974 --> 11:54.807
nothing else will do.

11:54.809 --> 11:57.843
How very eccentric of you.

11:59.446 --> 12:01.731
- Your card.
- Course.

12:01.733 --> 12:04.534
Have a nice day.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.454
Mr. Reese, I switched
Pierce's titanium card

12:08.456 --> 12:10.239
for one
with a listening device.

12:10.241 --> 12:11.690
I also hacked
his online calendar.

12:11.692 --> 12:12.959
He'll be heading
back to the office

12:12.961 --> 12:17.163
for a round
of Friendczar depositions.

12:18.248 --> 12:20.383
Friendczar
destroyed my business.

12:20.385 --> 12:22.468
They ruined my reputation.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.170
No one returns my calls.

12:24.172 --> 12:26.806
And I can forget raising
any venture capital funds.

12:26.808 --> 12:28.724
Friendczar is aggressive
about purchasing

12:28.726 --> 12:30.893
and absorbing
small start-ups.

12:30.895 --> 12:32.711
And if a small CEO tries to go

12:32.713 --> 12:33.980
toe-to-toe with them,

12:33.982 --> 12:35.815
he gets sued
for patent infringement,

12:35.817 --> 12:37.383
no matter how bogus the suit.

12:38.603 --> 12:40.386
Could you tell me
why Logan Pierce

12:40.388 --> 12:42.138
can't even look the man
he's suing in the eye?

12:42.140 --> 12:43.523
'Cause he's asleep.

12:43.525 --> 12:46.242
Hmm?

12:53.033 --> 12:55.918
You didn't violate our patents,
we screwed up.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.703
We'll help you raise the venture
capital funds you lost.

12:57.705 --> 13:01.507
Uh, thank you.

13:01.509 --> 13:02.842
Who's next?

13:02.844 --> 13:04.410
Emily Morton's lawyers
are here.

13:04.412 --> 13:05.962
Mm, great.

13:05.964 --> 13:07.580
According to Detective Carter,

13:07.582 --> 13:09.915
Ms. Morton sold Friendczar
her matchmaking site,

13:09.917 --> 13:11.584
alchementary.com.

13:11.586 --> 13:13.970
They promised her they'd launch
her site worldwide,

13:13.972 --> 13:16.222
and instead, they made sure
it never saw the light of day.

13:16.224 --> 13:17.940
I see lawyers but no client.

13:17.942 --> 13:19.525
Our client is unable to appear

13:19.527 --> 13:21.811
due to
extenuating circumstances.

13:21.813 --> 13:23.262
A frivolous lawsuit
doesn't qualify

13:23.264 --> 13:25.231
as extenuating circumstances.

13:25.233 --> 13:26.532
But intimidation does.

13:26.534 --> 13:28.117
Hey, we have a board meeting
at 1:00.

13:28.119 --> 13:30.286
The board can meet me
on Coney Island.

13:30.288 --> 13:32.989
They have got
these bacon-wrapped hot dogs.

13:32.991 --> 13:35.575
Crispy on the outside,
juicy on the in.

13:35.577 --> 13:37.210
It's your basic
kosher nightmare.

13:37.212 --> 13:38.461
But you know what they say.

13:38.463 --> 13:40.997
"What happens
on Coney Island--"

13:40.999 --> 13:43.015
well, I guess nothing good
really happens on Coney Island,

13:43.017 --> 13:44.884
except for these dogs.

13:44.886 --> 13:46.669
What a lunatic.

13:46.671 --> 13:48.087
If we don't get ahold
of Ms. Morton,

13:48.089 --> 13:49.788
we're gonna have
to drop the lawsuit.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.407
Finch, Emily's missing,

13:51.409 --> 13:53.175
and her lawyer just implied
she's being intimidated.

13:53.177 --> 13:55.177
Right before her suit
goes to trial.

13:55.179 --> 13:57.179
The timing
is a little too perfect.

13:57.181 --> 13:58.598
Maybe Pierce and his partner

13:58.600 --> 14:02.168
had something to do
with her disappearance.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.686
- Pierce?
- Hmm?

14:03.688 --> 14:05.187
Two days
before your company's IPO,

14:05.189 --> 14:06.689
and you're streaking
across Tribeca?

14:06.691 --> 14:08.074
Tell me, Sinclair,

14:08.076 --> 14:09.575
do you buy
all your shirts pre-stuffed,

14:09.577 --> 14:11.409
or do you just fill 'em out
that way?

14:14.148 --> 14:15.615
Come here.

14:15.617 --> 14:17.333
Get your partner
back in the game,

14:17.335 --> 14:19.452
or I'm gonna call
an emergency board meeting.

14:19.454 --> 14:20.920
When you build
a viable web server

14:20.922 --> 14:22.371
using the LAMP stack, Sinclair,

14:22.373 --> 14:23.873
you're free to run the company.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.258
In fact, let's put it
before the board--

14:25.260 --> 14:27.126
you or me.

14:27.128 --> 14:28.494
That's what I thought.

14:28.496 --> 14:31.681
Lunchtime, bitches.

14:31.683 --> 14:33.466
Finch, even his own company's

14:33.468 --> 14:36.302
having trouble
curbing Pierce's behavior.

14:36.304 --> 14:37.553
Glad to hear we're not alone.

14:46.364 --> 14:48.364
Pierce is headed
to Coney Island.

14:48.366 --> 14:51.117
I'm on it.

14:55.122 --> 14:56.522
Something's not right.

14:56.524 --> 14:58.074
Normally Pierce drives fast,

14:58.076 --> 15:00.660
but he drives with precision.

15:00.662 --> 15:01.911
This is Logan Pierce.

15:01.913 --> 15:03.879
I have a slight problem
with my car.

15:03.881 --> 15:05.798
I can't slow down.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.416
Pierce's car won't decelerate.

15:07.418 --> 15:09.468
Most modern vehicles
can be hacked into.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.920
If you can get
within 10 meters,

15:10.922 --> 15:12.972
I should be able
to infiltrate the bluetooth,

15:12.974 --> 15:16.225
then access
the engine control unit.

15:17.978 --> 15:20.479
Whoa!

15:22.316 --> 15:24.483
Finch, he blew a light.
I lost him.

15:24.485 --> 15:25.985
No matter.
I'm in.

15:25.987 --> 15:28.487
Someone has hacked
into the car's ECU

15:28.489 --> 15:29.622
and installed malware,

15:29.624 --> 15:30.823
locked the car in third gear

15:30.825 --> 15:33.242
at 50 miles an hour.

15:33.244 --> 15:34.944
Hello, hello?
Is anybody there?

15:34.946 --> 15:36.562
My accelerator's stuck.

15:36.564 --> 15:38.164
I can't downshift.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.333
Communications
and emergency services.

15:40.335 --> 15:42.234
I understand
that you can't decelerate.

15:42.236 --> 15:44.036
I'll do my best
to remedy your problem.

15:44.038 --> 15:45.671
Remedy faster, Sherlock.

15:45.673 --> 15:47.340
I'm kinda hosed right now.

15:47.342 --> 15:48.874
Mr. Reese, do you have eyes
on Pierce?

15:48.876 --> 15:50.459
Yes, he's about ten seconds out

15:50.461 --> 15:52.795
from a catastrophic accident.

15:52.797 --> 15:54.463
You don't stop him, Finch,

15:54.465 --> 15:56.799
there's a cargo truck
that will.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.444
Finch, you saved him.

16:23.126 --> 16:24.980
Take me to the city.

16:26.964 --> 16:29.382
I can't protect someone
we can't keep up with.

16:29.384 --> 16:30.916
Well, what do you have in mind?

16:30.918 --> 16:35.304
A different tactic.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.592
Mr. Pierce,
there's a John Wiley to see you.

16:39.594 --> 16:40.893
Tell him I'm a busy man.

16:40.895 --> 16:43.596
If he objects,
have security show him out.

16:55.308 --> 16:58.327
I'll make this quick.

16:58.329 --> 17:02.248
I have it on good authority
that your life's in danger.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.501
And normally I'd just
follow you around,

17:05.502 --> 17:07.453
help behind the scenes,
but--

17:07.454 --> 17:09.171
well, you've got too much money

17:09.173 --> 17:12.174
and too many resources.

17:12.175 --> 17:13.742
I can protect you,
but only if you

17:13.744 --> 17:16.994
let me stick with you
for the next 48 hours.

17:29.843 --> 17:33.279
Sounds like fun.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.484
See, I knew
you were interesting.

17:53.357 --> 17:55.058
The freight train
just left for Des Moines.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.944
The machine will be
at the facility in ten days.

17:59.548 --> 18:02.082
I've been thinking
about you wanting

18:02.084 --> 18:03.833
to make a difference,
help people.

18:03.835 --> 18:05.285
You know, we can do that now.

18:05.287 --> 18:07.186
We could invest
in clean water initiatives,

18:07.188 --> 18:10.156
sustainable farming.

18:10.158 --> 18:12.191
We built the single
most powerful technology

18:12.193 --> 18:14.461
known to man--

18:14.463 --> 18:18.631
a machine that knows
when someone needs help.

18:18.633 --> 18:22.302
And you just gave it away.

18:22.304 --> 18:24.471
We had our chance, Harold.

18:24.473 --> 18:27.974
Well, we built it,
and it saves lives.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.392
Not enough lives.

18:29.394 --> 18:31.311
We've been over this, Nathan.

18:31.313 --> 18:32.595
The machine is gone.

18:32.597 --> 18:35.932
What if we could
still access it?

18:35.934 --> 18:37.984
We decided
we weren't going to play God.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.219
We weren't going to build
a back door.

18:40.221 --> 18:43.857
We decided a lot of things
the last seven years.

18:43.859 --> 18:47.777
And that one,
I'm the least proud of.

18:47.779 --> 18:49.395
We did what we set out to do.

18:49.397 --> 18:52.832
Now, either we move on
to the next thing together,

18:52.834 --> 18:56.536
or <i>we</i> don't.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.909
You decide.

19:13.104 --> 19:15.805
Alchementary uses
and advanced algorithm

19:15.807 --> 19:17.724
to predict
if the relationship will last,

19:17.726 --> 19:19.359
and not just
romantic relationships.

19:19.361 --> 19:22.612
Uh, business, friendships,
you name it.

19:22.614 --> 19:24.981
Logan Pierce and Justin Ogilvy

19:24.983 --> 19:28.034
promised to launch
Alchementary.

19:28.036 --> 19:31.204
I am going to make sure
they keep their promise.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.713
Hey, Pierce, buddy.

19:40.715 --> 19:44.084
Before you go, about tonight.

19:44.086 --> 19:46.669
Party. New York stock exchange.
Potential investors.

19:46.671 --> 19:48.388
Right, right.
I'll be early.

19:48.390 --> 19:49.939
And make sure there's
an extra invitation

19:49.941 --> 19:51.558
for Mr. Wiley here.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.427
Is this the guy who outbid you
at the charity auction?

19:54.429 --> 19:56.012
We're considering a merger.

19:56.014 --> 19:57.514
And you think
that's a good idea,

19:57.516 --> 19:59.298
partnering with a guy
you just met?

19:59.300 --> 20:00.850
Oh, I think it's ideal.

20:00.852 --> 20:03.103
I haven't had time
to learn all his flaws yet.

20:03.105 --> 20:05.738
See you at the party, bitches.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.524
Mr. Reese,
Emily Morton vowed

20:07.526 --> 20:10.309
to make Pierce
launch her technology,

20:10.311 --> 20:12.328
a technology
that would seriously compete

20:12.330 --> 20:13.663
with Friendczar.

20:13.665 --> 20:15.198
Pretty sure Pierce
is the victim,

20:15.200 --> 20:16.566
not the perpetrator.

20:16.568 --> 20:18.701
Someone already
made an attempt on his life.

20:18.703 --> 20:21.588
Someone with hacking skills.

20:21.590 --> 20:25.558
Someone like
a missing software engineer.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.210
Why get the exact same car

20:27.212 --> 20:29.328
when your old one
didn't even have a scratch?

20:29.330 --> 20:31.264
'Cause it's unparalleled.

20:31.266 --> 20:33.883
I don't collect toys,
just the best of what I need.

20:33.885 --> 20:37.020
One car. One watch.

20:37.022 --> 20:39.505
2 mil, charts the phase
and the orbit of the moon,

20:39.507 --> 20:41.174
tells time to the nanosecond,

20:41.176 --> 20:43.893
and I don't have to wind it.

20:43.895 --> 20:46.813
For $2 million,
I certainly hope not.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.689
Welcome to my humble abode.

20:56.691 --> 20:59.292
You call this humble?

20:59.294 --> 21:01.461
Single malt scotch,
neat, right?

21:01.463 --> 21:02.962
That's what you had
at the auction.

21:02.964 --> 21:04.164
No, thanks.

21:04.166 --> 21:07.333
That's impressive though.

21:07.335 --> 21:09.586
Knowing people is my business.

21:09.588 --> 21:10.970
I thought your business was

21:10.972 --> 21:14.057
schmoozing investors
for your IPO.

21:14.059 --> 21:18.211
My watch might not be able
to tell time to the nanosecond,

21:18.213 --> 21:19.596
but you're late.

21:19.598 --> 21:21.648
I have better things to do.

21:23.384 --> 21:26.385
Finch, Pierce is missing
his own party.

21:26.387 --> 21:27.720
Just as well.

21:27.722 --> 21:29.772
Pierce won't be safe
in public now.

21:29.774 --> 21:33.026
Check your phone.

21:33.028 --> 21:34.644
Friendczar's IPO is predicted

21:34.646 --> 21:36.663
to reach
record-breaking numbers.

21:36.665 --> 21:38.281
Do you think
you'll make history?

21:38.283 --> 21:40.366
Well, with stock this
overvalued, how could we not?

21:40.368 --> 21:41.951
You know, personally, Janet,
I'd wait to buy

21:41.953 --> 21:43.903
for at least a day or two
till after the stock dips.

21:43.905 --> 21:46.172
You know what I mean?

21:46.174 --> 21:48.124
The board called
an emergency meeting.

21:48.126 --> 21:52.795
Pierce is no longer
CEO of Friendczar.

21:56.051 --> 21:57.433
Who died?

21:57.435 --> 21:59.719
Oh, God.
Don't tell me it was me.

21:59.721 --> 22:02.438
The board thinks
they can do your job after all.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.924
You're out.

22:04.926 --> 22:08.094
Well, here's to unemployment.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.375
I don't feel very good.

22:22.377 --> 22:24.043
Pierce?

22:24.045 --> 22:25.662
Pierce.

22:25.664 --> 22:27.463
Sit back, sit back, sit back.

22:27.465 --> 22:29.582
You're having a reaction.

22:29.584 --> 22:32.085
Are you allergic to anything?

22:32.087 --> 22:35.288
Naproxen.

22:35.290 --> 22:36.506
Mr. Reese,
what's going on?

22:36.508 --> 22:37.924
The scotch, it was spiked.

22:47.269 --> 22:49.302
Pierce is going
into anaphylactic shock.

22:49.304 --> 22:51.237
- Sending an ambulance.
- There's no time.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.805
I need to get air
into his lungs.

22:52.807 --> 22:54.907
Relax.

22:54.909 --> 22:56.809
Look at me.
You're going to be okay.

23:07.321 --> 23:10.456
Is Pierce all right,
Mr. Reese?

23:11.592 --> 23:13.293
Yes.

23:13.295 --> 23:16.963
But he's gonna have
one hell of a hangover.

23:28.843 --> 23:31.561
You saved me.

23:31.563 --> 23:32.979
In the Chinese culture,
you'd be responsible

23:32.981 --> 23:34.647
for me for life.

23:34.649 --> 23:39.319
Glad neither one of us
is Chinese then.

23:40.237 --> 23:42.538
Who has access to your house?

23:42.540 --> 23:46.292
Just a hundred or so
of my closest friends.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.328
I like people.

23:48.330 --> 23:50.079
I like to party.

23:50.081 --> 23:51.964
Who knows you're allergic
to naproxen?

23:51.966 --> 23:53.082
I don't know, I didn't develop

23:53.084 --> 23:54.533
the allergy till recently.

23:54.535 --> 23:55.968
Why are you doing this?

23:55.970 --> 23:57.503
Did somebody
put you up to this?

23:57.505 --> 24:00.256
Is this penance
for some deep, dark mistake?

24:00.258 --> 24:03.142
Spoken like a man
who's made his fair share.

24:03.144 --> 24:05.678
I--
mistakes don't interest me.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.147
I don't look back.
You keep moving.

24:08.149 --> 24:09.548
It's the only way
to stay alive.

24:09.550 --> 24:11.184
Philosophy makes sense,

24:11.186 --> 24:15.855
coming from a kid whose parents
went bankrupt.

24:16.940 --> 24:20.576
Knowing people
is my business too.

24:22.746 --> 24:24.864
Well, my dad
owned a little camera shop.

24:24.866 --> 24:27.617
And, um...

24:27.619 --> 24:30.870
he made most of his money
developing film.

24:30.872 --> 24:34.407
And he insisted
on staying the course,

24:34.409 --> 24:38.211
all the way until the point
that film became extinct.

24:38.213 --> 24:40.346
And then he tried
to sell digital cameras,

24:40.348 --> 24:41.798
but by then it was too late

24:41.800 --> 24:43.549
because everyone had one
in their phone.

24:43.551 --> 24:45.968
It's like he didn't even
see it coming.

24:45.970 --> 24:48.888
When the business failed,
we lost everything.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.923
And you think
if you're constantly evolving,

24:50.925 --> 24:52.275
this won't happen to you?

24:52.277 --> 24:53.759
Of course it'll happen.

24:53.761 --> 24:55.361
But if you accept
change is inevitable,

24:55.363 --> 24:58.564
it doesn't crush you
when it does.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.452
Every technology ages, John.

25:02.454 --> 25:04.654
The only thing
that never gets old

25:04.656 --> 25:07.940
is connecting with people.

25:07.942 --> 25:11.160
That's what everyone wants,

25:11.162 --> 25:12.945
a real connection.

25:12.947 --> 25:15.548
Well, you might wanna consider

25:15.550 --> 25:18.418
losing a couple hundred
of your closest friends.

25:18.420 --> 25:20.619
Mm-hmm.

25:23.123 --> 25:26.625
I think you've had
enough excitement for one night.

25:26.627 --> 25:29.896
I'm gonna rest my eyes

25:29.898 --> 25:33.649
and give you a break.

25:37.154 --> 25:39.155
I've put the billionaire
to bed, Finch.

25:39.157 --> 25:42.325
We need to meet.

25:43.894 --> 25:45.644
Nice night for a walk.

25:45.646 --> 25:47.280
Why didn't you bring Bear?

25:47.282 --> 25:48.815
Bear didn't wanna come.

25:48.817 --> 25:51.534
I read that
if there's anxiety in the home,

25:51.536 --> 25:54.454
it can make your pets
become upset.

25:54.456 --> 25:57.039
Have you been
under any excess stress?

25:57.041 --> 26:00.042
You mean besides being locked
in an 11x13 in Rikers

26:00.044 --> 26:01.961
and wearing a bomb vest
around Manhattan?

26:01.963 --> 26:03.629
Not really.

26:03.631 --> 26:07.683
Whoever poisoned Pierce
had access to his home.

26:07.685 --> 26:09.268
We need to move him.

26:09.270 --> 26:11.437
My thinking exactly.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.722
I'll have Detective Carter

26:12.724 --> 26:16.275
examine the decanter
for prints.

26:16.277 --> 26:18.644
You can escort our friend
to the safe house.

26:18.646 --> 26:20.679
Time to wake the billionaire.

26:20.681 --> 26:22.648
I'm awake.

26:22.650 --> 26:25.318
And just who are you?

26:42.048 --> 26:43.415
You don't wanna tell me
who you are?

26:43.417 --> 26:47.002
That's okay.
I already know.

26:47.004 --> 26:49.121
Tell me, how did you make
a bug small enough

26:49.123 --> 26:50.756
to fit inside this?

26:50.758 --> 26:52.391
Your voice too.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.093
You hacked
into my car's computer

26:54.095 --> 26:58.180
and you remotely accessed
the accelerator and the brakes.

26:58.182 --> 27:00.265
So I guess that makes you
the brains of the operation.

27:00.267 --> 27:01.483
No offense.

27:01.485 --> 27:02.818
And judging
by your bespoke suit,

27:02.820 --> 27:05.671
you're also the bank.

27:05.673 --> 27:07.039
And there's you, John.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.941
You took out
my security guard Zvi.

27:08.943 --> 27:12.861
He's a former Mossad agent
and an expert in Krav Maga.

27:12.863 --> 27:14.396
So what is it, John?

27:14.398 --> 27:17.583
Former Special Ops?
Ex-CIA?

27:17.585 --> 27:22.004
And you,
just a very rich hacker?

27:22.006 --> 27:24.823
As far as you're concerned,
Mr. Pierce,

27:24.825 --> 27:26.542
we don't exist.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.761
But that's
what's most impressive.

27:28.763 --> 27:30.713
John, I've been looking
into you.

27:30.715 --> 27:32.548
And I'm not talking about
your bogus hedge fund cover.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.600
You and your partner here
don't seem

27:34.602 --> 27:35.851
to have a digital footprint.

27:35.853 --> 27:37.219
So I have to ask myself,

27:37.221 --> 27:40.172
how is this possible
in this information age?

27:40.174 --> 27:42.391
People with that kind
of anonymity,

27:42.393 --> 27:44.109
that's true power.

27:44.111 --> 27:45.694
So you see, I know who you are.

27:45.696 --> 27:47.512
The only thing I don't know

27:47.514 --> 27:49.198
is why you do what you do.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.449
Let me remind you,
Mr. Pierce,

27:50.451 --> 27:53.235
that we saved your life twice.

27:53.237 --> 27:55.621
Now, you wanna keep on
butting into our affairs?

27:55.623 --> 27:56.855
Or do you want to live?

27:56.857 --> 27:58.540
No need to get testy.

27:58.542 --> 28:00.993
I was just making small talk.

28:00.995 --> 28:02.544
So what's the plan?

28:02.546 --> 28:04.663
I'm afraid
that you can't trust anyone.

28:04.665 --> 28:07.532
We've arranged to take you
to a safe house nearby.

28:07.534 --> 28:09.551
You don't want anyone
to find me,

28:09.553 --> 28:11.587
but you're keeping me
in the city?

28:11.589 --> 28:14.840
You know a better place?

28:28.554 --> 28:30.189
Where exactly is this place?

28:30.191 --> 28:31.490
We just flew ten hours.

28:31.492 --> 28:34.693
You can't wait one more minute?

28:37.330 --> 28:40.582
So what do you think?

28:40.584 --> 28:42.451
You said you had a safe house.

28:42.453 --> 28:44.336
- Yeah.
- This is a bar.

28:44.338 --> 28:46.238
No, this--
this is a bomb shelter

28:46.240 --> 28:48.874
made into a bar,
and it is totally safe.

28:48.876 --> 28:51.043
Sit, please.

28:51.045 --> 28:54.763
Come on.
Come on.

28:54.765 --> 28:58.383
This is good.

29:00.553 --> 29:02.604
What are we doing here?

29:02.606 --> 29:05.257
Do you like pierogies?

29:05.259 --> 29:06.642
I have it
on very good authority

29:06.644 --> 29:08.727
they have the best
in the world, so--

29:08.729 --> 29:13.398
You flew me
halfway across the world

29:13.400 --> 29:15.600
for fried dumplings?

29:19.272 --> 29:21.974
Double-fried.

29:23.743 --> 29:26.044
Yeah.

29:28.781 --> 29:30.999
Bear, look.

29:31.001 --> 29:35.471
Mmm.

29:42.429 --> 29:43.729
_

29:45.432 --> 29:47.015
Detective, you're just
the person I wanna speak to.

29:47.017 --> 29:50.352
Any closer to discovering
who poisoned Logan Pierce?

29:50.354 --> 29:52.688
Got a partial print
off the decanter,

29:52.690 --> 29:54.156
sent it through AFIS.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.825
Came up with a match
with 11 points in common.

29:56.827 --> 29:58.143
The guy's prints
weren't on file

29:58.145 --> 30:01.330
because he's an officer
of the court.

30:04.818 --> 30:07.085
Mm-hmm.

30:07.087 --> 30:08.537
Mmm.

30:08.539 --> 30:10.539
- Might wanna slow down.
- Hmm?

30:10.541 --> 30:12.958
I can't protect you
from a heart attack.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.594
You know,

30:15.596 --> 30:17.930
you need to enjoy life.

30:17.932 --> 30:19.681
Who knows how to enjoy life

30:19.683 --> 30:21.333
as much as you, Pierce?

30:21.335 --> 30:23.385
How did he find us?

30:23.387 --> 30:25.837
<i>He</i> got a text from Pierce.

30:25.839 --> 30:27.389
I think you actually
take pleasure

30:27.391 --> 30:28.974
in making me schlep after you.

30:28.976 --> 30:31.143
These couldn't wait?

30:31.145 --> 30:32.844
- What?
- I thought we agreed.

30:32.846 --> 30:34.897
- No friends.
- Well, he's also my lawyer.

30:34.899 --> 30:37.115
You know, and the board
forced me out.

30:37.117 --> 30:38.617
And in doing so,
they relinquished

30:38.619 --> 30:40.068
my non-compete clause,

30:40.070 --> 30:42.020
which is good,
'cause I am officially

30:42.022 --> 30:44.373
looking for a new job.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.325
Mr. Reese,
something you should know.

30:46.327 --> 30:48.544
Campbell's prints
were on the decanter of scotch.

30:48.546 --> 30:50.462
The board made Pierce
take a medical exam

30:50.464 --> 30:52.214
for his corporate insurance.

30:52.216 --> 30:54.199
His lawyer filed the paperwork.

30:54.201 --> 30:56.752
You spiked his alcohol.

30:56.754 --> 31:00.372
You read about his allergy
on his insurance application.

31:00.374 --> 31:04.676
You tried to kill him.

31:04.678 --> 31:07.095
Jeremy?

31:07.097 --> 31:08.564
Is that true?

31:08.566 --> 31:10.682
No, that's absurd.

31:10.684 --> 31:13.068
You're my best client,
my only client.

31:13.070 --> 31:14.436
Pierce plans
to switch law firms

31:14.438 --> 31:15.904
after the IPO is released.

31:15.906 --> 31:17.155
Why would I want you dead?

31:17.157 --> 31:19.191
Maybe because your only client

31:19.193 --> 31:21.559
is looking for a new attorney.

31:21.561 --> 31:25.948
Was I talking to you?

31:25.950 --> 31:28.166
Who the hell
do you think you are?

31:28.168 --> 31:30.869
You might wanna keep
your hands to yourself.

31:30.871 --> 31:32.170
You threatening me?

31:32.172 --> 31:33.422
Aah!

31:34.758 --> 31:37.575
Aah!

31:37.577 --> 31:41.246
Yo, Pierce, are we missing
all the fun?

31:43.266 --> 31:44.883
Uh...

31:44.885 --> 31:46.435
Full disclosure, I might have

31:46.437 --> 31:48.753
mentioned our little trip
to one or two people.

31:48.755 --> 31:50.555
I mean, you can't expect me

31:50.557 --> 31:52.274
to be all business, can you?

31:52.276 --> 31:55.760
If you're not gonna
take your safety seriously,

31:55.762 --> 31:59.698
why should I?

31:59.700 --> 32:02.734
Oh, come on.
Relax, dude.

32:02.736 --> 32:04.620
Join the party!

32:04.622 --> 32:06.905
Campbell's no longer
a threat, Finch.

32:06.907 --> 32:08.240
Pierce has got enough friends.

32:08.242 --> 32:10.075
He doesn't need our help.

32:22.006 --> 32:23.588
Hey, you want a coffee
or something?

32:23.590 --> 32:25.924
No, I'm good, thanks.

32:25.926 --> 32:29.027
What you doing here, anyway?

32:29.029 --> 32:32.964
Somebody made two cops
disappear without a trace.

32:36.486 --> 32:38.070
Probably not the kind of stuff

32:38.072 --> 32:42.324
you wanna leave
lying around your desk, huh?

32:42.326 --> 32:43.975
Been thinking
about the billionaire,

32:43.977 --> 32:45.777
his own lawyer
trying to do him in.

32:45.779 --> 32:47.446
My heart breaks for him.

32:47.448 --> 32:50.648
I'm glad you got my back.

32:56.923 --> 33:00.592
You got a point, Fusco?

33:00.594 --> 33:02.210
Carter, there are some things
you should know about me.

33:02.212 --> 33:04.129
- Some mistakes I've made--
- No.

33:04.131 --> 33:07.132
We're not doing that.

33:07.134 --> 33:10.802
You don't get
to share that with me.

33:10.804 --> 33:13.772
Now you say you've changed,
so I'm gonna trust you.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.524
But if those mistakes you made

33:15.526 --> 33:18.110
come back to haunt you,
you will not

33:18.112 --> 33:21.480
expect me to cover for you.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.281
Now we may be partners,

33:23.283 --> 33:25.367
and we might even be friends,

33:25.369 --> 33:29.237
but, um, I'm still a cop.

33:29.239 --> 33:31.623
Understood?

33:31.625 --> 33:34.826
Yeah, I hear you.
Loud and clear.

33:49.926 --> 33:52.227
I'll be home in 12 hours
to help with the next number.

33:52.229 --> 33:53.812
I'm afraid that'll be too late.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.347
The next number's
already come up,

33:55.349 --> 33:56.765
only it's not new.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.567
Someone we've helped before?

33:58.569 --> 34:00.519
Someone
we're currently helping.

34:00.521 --> 34:01.987
Logan Pierce.

34:01.989 --> 34:04.272
There's another threat
against him,

34:04.274 --> 34:07.225
or else someone
is conspiring with the lawyer.

34:07.227 --> 34:08.493
All I know for certain

34:08.495 --> 34:10.728
is that Pierce
is in immediate danger.

34:10.730 --> 34:15.199
I'm headed back
to the club now.

34:15.202 --> 34:18.235
No need. I was able to hack
Pierce's credit card account.

34:18.237 --> 34:19.737
His card was just used

34:19.739 --> 34:23.257
at the Grand Vishera Hotel
in St. Petersburg.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.210
I'm sending you the address.

34:25.212 --> 34:28.547
It's right over the bridge.

34:29.931 --> 34:33.717
Pierce, it's John.

34:41.761 --> 34:43.645
Stop right there.

34:43.647 --> 34:45.730
He warned me
someone would come.

34:45.732 --> 34:48.366
I've called security, get out.

34:48.368 --> 34:50.534
Emily, what are you doing here?

34:52.105 --> 34:55.106
I said get out, now!

34:55.108 --> 34:56.774
Mr. Reese,
what's going on?

34:56.775 --> 34:59.411
Emily Morton.

34:59.413 --> 35:03.048
She's alive and appears
to be a pretty good...

35:03.050 --> 35:06.885
shot.

35:06.887 --> 35:10.255
What do you mean, he warned you
someone else would come?

35:11.925 --> 35:14.726
Who's he?

35:18.548 --> 35:21.783
Pierce put you up
at this hotel, didn't he?

35:24.403 --> 35:26.855
Finch, Emily's not
working against Pierce.

35:26.857 --> 35:30.275
She's working with him.

35:32.578 --> 35:34.112
I haven't seen Pierce
since he came

35:34.114 --> 35:36.314
by my apartment
about a week ago.

35:36.316 --> 35:39.201
Said someone was on to us,
told me to pack a bag,

35:39.203 --> 35:42.153
so I could finish Alchementary.

35:42.155 --> 35:44.623
We planned to announce
our project tomorrow.

35:44.625 --> 35:47.025
Emily's technology
will cannibalize

35:47.027 --> 35:49.511
Friendczar's business.

35:49.513 --> 35:51.546
It seems the person
closest to Pierce

35:51.548 --> 35:54.466
is the one
with the most to lose.

35:57.336 --> 35:59.104
Justin?

35:59.106 --> 36:01.857
Is that you, buddy?

36:03.676 --> 36:06.645
Hey.

36:11.734 --> 36:15.287
Well, I guess
we're breaking up the company.

36:15.289 --> 36:16.688
Sorry, Pierce.

36:16.690 --> 36:19.074
But you brought this
on yourself.

36:37.587 --> 36:39.671
- No, no, no!
- Give us a minute.

36:43.493 --> 36:46.878
Always knew a woman
would come between us.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.496
Just didn't think it'd be

36:48.498 --> 36:50.298
'cause you liked
her technology better.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.550
Emily didn't break us up,
Justin, you did.

36:52.552 --> 36:55.687
You know, she actually
reminds me of you,

36:55.689 --> 36:59.340
how you used to be--

36:59.342 --> 37:02.644
passionate, principled.

37:02.646 --> 37:04.979
Before you decided
we need to bully

37:04.981 --> 37:06.681
and bury our competition.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.650
I didn't hear you objecting.

37:08.652 --> 37:09.901
That's 'cause you
weren't listening to me.

37:09.903 --> 37:11.453
How many times did I tell you

37:11.455 --> 37:13.037
I don't wanna
run a business like that?

37:13.039 --> 37:14.989
You didn't wanna
<i>run</i> a business at all,

37:14.991 --> 37:16.691
left me to do everything.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.693
I thought maybe
you'd gone off the deep end,

37:18.695 --> 37:20.528
parading around town
half-naked,

37:20.530 --> 37:23.581
taking board meetings
at Coney Island.

37:23.583 --> 37:26.384
Then I realized,

37:26.386 --> 37:28.419
if the board pushed you out,

37:28.421 --> 37:30.805
your non-compete clause
would be null and void,

37:30.807 --> 37:33.341
and you could take
Emily's technology public.

37:33.343 --> 37:34.726
Emily's idea's better.

37:34.728 --> 37:36.728
It's what people want,
the perfect match

37:36.730 --> 37:39.514
in love and friendship,
even business.

37:39.516 --> 37:41.349
What do you know about friends?

37:41.351 --> 37:46.104
All your friends want you dead.

37:53.395 --> 37:57.282
Even your new pal's left you.

37:57.284 --> 38:00.001
Dump him.

38:03.707 --> 38:06.508
No, no!

38:09.095 --> 38:13.581
No! Wait, wait!

38:13.583 --> 38:14.599
Wait!

38:27.646 --> 38:31.199
I had 'em right
where I wanted 'em, you know?

38:31.201 --> 38:34.319
You need to get
new friends, Pierce.

38:34.321 --> 38:37.789
I couldn't agree
with you more, man.

38:47.416 --> 38:50.251
Now either we move on
to the next thing together,

38:50.253 --> 38:51.786
or <i>we</i> don't.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.320
You decide.

38:54.529 --> 38:57.159
_

38:57.759 --> 39:00.176
_

39:05.045 --> 39:07.853
_

39:45.007 --> 39:47.275
Today Justin Ogilvy,
the co-founder

39:47.277 --> 39:49.644
of friendczar.com,
was brought up on charges

39:49.646 --> 39:52.647
for attempting to murder
his partner Logan Pierce

39:52.649 --> 39:54.215
in what can only be described
as a bizarre case.

39:54.217 --> 39:56.183
Some friendships
aren't made to last.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.785
The Friendczar IPO
has continued

39:57.787 --> 40:00.154
its downward slump
after an announcement

40:00.156 --> 40:02.373
that Logan Pierce
is launching a new company

40:02.375 --> 40:04.525
that's in direct competition
with Friendczar.

40:04.527 --> 40:08.246
Pierce is partnering with
software engineer Emily Morton

40:08.248 --> 40:11.249
and surprisingly, Ben Kamin,
his former rival.

40:11.251 --> 40:15.887
Thanks, Janet, now turning
our attention to the weather.

40:18.674 --> 40:21.592
All right, Chewie,
prepare to get posterized.

40:21.594 --> 40:23.311
You know, I heard
your mother sat on her iPhone,

40:23.313 --> 40:25.880
and it turned to an iPad.
Is that true, man?

40:25.882 --> 40:28.266
Is it true?

40:28.268 --> 40:30.501
Come on now.

40:30.503 --> 40:32.186
I could go all day.

40:32.188 --> 40:33.888
Next bucket gets
the other guy's car.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.940
Or in your case, your bike,

40:35.942 --> 40:37.608
or metrocard, whatever.

40:37.610 --> 40:39.243
Bet's a bet.

40:39.245 --> 40:41.195
Whoa, thief!
You are a thief.

40:41.197 --> 40:42.897
We said check the ball.
You guys hear--

40:42.899 --> 40:44.332
you heard me say
check the ball, right?

40:44.334 --> 40:45.833
No, that's ball game,
what you said.

40:45.835 --> 40:47.919
I'm just kidding, showboat.

40:47.921 --> 40:52.239
I'm a man of my word.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.841
Man, you crazy.

40:53.843 --> 40:56.377
Yeah, I've heard that.

41:06.889 --> 41:10.391
You got some game.

41:10.393 --> 41:12.060
You're full of surprises.

41:12.062 --> 41:13.561
- You're one to talk.
- Yeah?

41:13.563 --> 41:15.730
Partnering with Kamin,
your competition.

41:15.732 --> 41:17.598
The guy's a straight shooter,
you know?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.934
Plus, Emily's software
said we're totally compatible,

41:19.936 --> 41:22.286
not so much
with his wife though.

41:22.288 --> 41:24.572
One thing I don't get--

41:24.574 --> 41:26.774
you warned Emily about Ogilvy.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.160
And you knew he was after you.

41:29.162 --> 41:30.661
Why didn't you tell me?

41:30.663 --> 41:32.113
Haven't you heard?

41:32.115 --> 41:35.550
I have a reckless disregard
for my own safety.

41:35.552 --> 41:38.803
You just wanted to see
how I worked.

41:41.607 --> 41:43.641
You know,
I finally figured it out,

41:43.643 --> 41:46.761
why you do what you do.

41:46.763 --> 41:48.813
Altruism.

41:48.815 --> 41:52.817
How's that working out for you?

41:54.686 --> 41:57.522
Just a little thank-you.

41:57.524 --> 42:00.074
So I guess
you will be moving on

42:00.076 --> 42:01.642
to your next hapless stranger?

42:06.615 --> 42:08.666
I can at least give you a lift.

42:08.668 --> 42:12.837
Actually, I, uh--

42:12.839 --> 42:17.158
I think I'll take the subway.

42:20.879 --> 42:23.631
What are we doing here, Finch?

42:23.633 --> 42:24.966
Do we have another number?

42:24.968 --> 42:27.051
No, a date.

42:27.053 --> 42:28.853
You got me a date?

42:28.855 --> 42:30.805
Not you. Bear.

42:30.807 --> 42:32.390
He needs a friend.

42:32.392 --> 42:34.275
Hello.

42:34.277 --> 42:36.477
Go.

42:38.615 --> 42:40.698
Good thinking, Finch.

42:47.239 --> 42:50.792
Our billionaire gave me
a little something.

42:55.914 --> 42:59.634
Well--

42:59.636 --> 43:03.704
Tells time to the nanosecond.

43:12.347 --> 43:14.899
That was
a very expensive watch.

43:14.901 --> 43:17.551
Not to mention, a gift.

43:17.553 --> 43:21.823
A gift equipped with GPS.

43:23.692 --> 43:27.495
A cunning billionaire
with unlimited resources.

43:27.497 --> 43:31.582
Our friend is just
curious enough to be dangerous.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.597
