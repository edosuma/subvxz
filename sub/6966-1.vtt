00:40.340 --> 00:41.800
Lunchtime!

00:42.759 --> 00:46.263
The longer you animals bark,
the colder your lunch gets.

00:46.471 --> 00:49.141
Come on, move it out.
You too, down there!

00:49.474 --> 00:50.392
Hey, turkey!

01:06.825 --> 01:08.452
"You schmuck.

01:08.660 --> 01:12.497
Do you think I'd be stupid enough
to kill myself?" Kill myself?

01:38.440 --> 01:39.524
Come on!

01:46.365 --> 01:47.991
Here he comes.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.334
Francis, the lock.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.669
Let go of the handle.

01:58.877 --> 02:00.837
I don't have the handle! Open it!

02:01.046 --> 02:02.214
Jake, up!

02:02.422 --> 02:04.675
Come on, move! Get on!

02:06.343 --> 02:07.219
Thanks, Mama.

02:54.266 --> 02:56.894
Okay, you guys.
Let's try the victory pyramid.

02:57.769 --> 02:59.062
Okay, let's go.

03:01.356 --> 03:03.400
Come on. Put your arms up.

03:03.734 --> 03:05.485
Smile. Good, we got it!

03:23.003 --> 03:25.964
Turn that TV off.
I can't hear myself think.

03:26.131 --> 03:27.633
Yeah, right, Dad.

03:35.057 --> 03:37.184
Is the water going down, son?

03:37.643 --> 03:40.103
- Nope.
- Is it going down now?

04:11.843 --> 04:13.512
Wow, a police chase!

04:19.851 --> 04:21.060
Oh, shit!

04:31.488 --> 04:32.864
What are we doing here?

04:33.073 --> 04:34.825
Trust in your mother, boys.

04:35.033 --> 04:38.370
Throw her into four-wheel drive
and hold on to your hats.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.045
Bummer!

05:28.754 --> 05:32.299
Nothing exciting ever happens
around here anyway.

05:32.507 --> 05:33.926
Who needs the Goon Docks?

05:34.927 --> 05:38.388
Who needs this house?
I can't wait to get out of here.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.058
Really?

05:41.850 --> 05:45.270
No, I was just trying to delate
myself. No, no....

05:48.690 --> 05:50.067
Dictate myself.

05:50.275 --> 05:52.486
That's delude yourself, dummy.

05:52.861 --> 05:54.279
That's what I said.

06:01.536 --> 06:02.871
Thanks, Brand.

06:04.289 --> 06:06.166
I know how you feel, wimp.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.253
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.094
Adopted wuss.

06:17.219 --> 06:17.719
I'm no adopted wuss!

06:18.929 --> 06:20.847
I'll kill you, Brand!

06:23.517 --> 06:24.768
It's Mouth.

06:25.727 --> 06:27.104
Hey, Mikey.

06:27.896 --> 06:29.523
Yo, Mikey.

06:30.107 --> 06:32.943
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?

06:33.777 --> 06:35.946
- What's going down?
- Get your foot off the table.

06:36.154 --> 06:38.532
You got it. What's going down, guys?

06:39.324 --> 06:41.118
What's the matter with you guys?

06:41.326 --> 06:44.037
What's the matter? What is this?
A nuclear Saturday?

06:44.246 --> 06:45.622
Come on, guys.

06:45.831 --> 06:47.958
This is our last weekend together.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.960
Last Goonie weekend.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.629
We gotta be going out in style.

06:53.463 --> 06:56.633
Cruising the coast,
sniffing some lace...

06:56.842 --> 06:59.803
...downing the brews, but no!

07:00.012 --> 07:03.223
The one older brother had to go
and screw it up.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.812
Flunking your driver's test?
I don't know what to do with you.

07:09.187 --> 07:11.148
You guys, let me in!

07:11.356 --> 07:12.482
Jerk alert.

07:13.025 --> 07:14.651
It's Chunk.

07:15.527 --> 07:18.739
I just saw the most amazing thing
in my entire life!

07:18.947 --> 07:20.699
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.

07:21.199 --> 07:22.534
Come on!

07:23.118 --> 07:24.202
Do it.

07:24.536 --> 07:25.704
Come on!

07:26.246 --> 07:27.080
Do it!

07:34.713 --> 07:36.256
Cut it out, Mouth.

07:37.966 --> 07:39.384
Get out.

08:06.870 --> 08:09.289
Thanks a lot.
You, guys, you won't believe me.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.208
I'm telling the truth.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.292
You turd!

08:12.501 --> 08:14.169
- Flunked your driver's test.
- Shut up.

08:14.378 --> 08:18.423
Listen, you'll never believe me.
There was two cop cars, okay?

08:18.632 --> 08:21.635
They were chasing this four-wheel
deal, a real neat ORV.

08:21.843 --> 08:25.889
Bullets flying everywhere. It was
the most amazing thing I ever saw!

08:26.098 --> 08:29.726
More amazing than when
Michael Jackson used your bathroom?

08:29.935 --> 08:33.522
More amazing than when you saved
those old people from that fire?

08:33.730 --> 08:37.484
More amazing than when you ate your
weight in Godfather's pizza?

08:37.693 --> 08:42.239
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to
my house to use the bathroom.

08:42.447 --> 08:43.573
But his sister did.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.120
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.582
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.

08:57.796 --> 08:59.506
- Open the door!
- Mikey!

08:59.715 --> 09:00.591
The screen door!

09:06.096 --> 09:10.183
Hey! I bet you guys thought l
was gonna drop it, huh?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.644
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.062
- You idiot!
- Oh, my God!

09:16.273 --> 09:19.693
Look, it's not broken.
It's perfect.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.654
- Oh, my God!
- What?

09:22.863 --> 09:26.116
- That's my mom's most favorite piece!
- What?

09:26.992 --> 09:28.452
Oh, my God.

09:28.619 --> 09:30.787
- You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Shut up!

09:30.996 --> 09:31.830
Shut up, Mouth.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.666
- Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
- No.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.920
Certainly. It's where Motown started.

09:38.128 --> 09:40.172
Also got the country's
highest murder rate.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.467
That's where we move to when we
lose our house tomorrow.

09:43.675 --> 09:46.720
Shut up. It'll never
happen. My dad'll fix it.

09:46.929 --> 09:48.722
Yeah, sure he will.

09:49.139 --> 09:51.725
If he gets his next 400 paychecks
by tomorrow.

09:51.934 --> 09:54.478
That's wrong, Brand.
It won't happen!

09:58.232 --> 09:59.733
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.777
Hi, hi!

10:02.569 --> 10:03.987
I see Data dropped by.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.573
Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you?

10:07.157 --> 10:09.701
Boys, this is Rosalita.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.455
She'll help with the packing until
my arm's better.

10:15.999 --> 10:19.503
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word
of English...

10:19.711 --> 10:22.172
...and I know some of you took
Spanish in school.

10:22.714 --> 10:25.968
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak
perfect Spanish.

10:26.176 --> 10:30.264
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad
to communicate with Rosalita.

10:30.472 --> 10:33.225
You're a lifesaver, Clark.
Come with us, will you?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.102
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.

10:35.310 --> 10:39.147
Mikey, no more potato chips.
Hello, Mikey.

10:39.356 --> 10:40.274
It's Brand, Ma.

10:45.195 --> 10:46.029
What?

10:49.658 --> 10:51.034
I wonder if she'll notice.

10:51.201 --> 10:52.452
That's what I said!

10:52.661 --> 10:54.705
Of course. She notices everything.

10:54.913 --> 10:57.207
Pants and shirts are in the second.

10:57.374 --> 11:01.420
Just throw them all into boxes.
Forget the suitcases.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.171
Can you translate that?

11:03.380 --> 11:06.758
- Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
- That's wonderful.

11:19.730 --> 11:21.064
Look. How's that?

11:21.273 --> 11:24.276
You idiot!
You glued it on upside down!

11:24.484 --> 11:27.529
If God meant it that way,
you'd be pissing in your faces.

11:27.738 --> 11:28.906
Looks fine to me.

11:29.114 --> 11:34.119
Rosalita, this is the attic.
Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.

11:34.328 --> 11:35.871
That's why it's always open.

11:48.342 --> 11:53.096
This is my supply closet. You'll
find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.

11:53.305 --> 11:56.266
I'd like the house clean
when they tear it down.

11:56.475 --> 11:58.310
Clark, can you translate?

12:08.654 --> 12:12.449
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be
very happy here.

12:12.616 --> 12:16.745
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do.
You're so fluent in languages.

12:19.706 --> 12:23.669
You're so fluent in Spanish.
That was so nice of you.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.796
"Nice" is my middle name.

12:25.963 --> 12:28.715
I'm taking Rosalita
to the supermarket.

12:28.924 --> 12:30.842
I'll be back in about an hour.

12:31.051 --> 12:36.306
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has
asthma, I don't want him in the rain.

12:36.515 --> 12:38.350
He should be in a plastic bubble.

12:38.559 --> 12:40.852
I'm serious. That's not funny.

12:41.061 --> 12:45.524
He takes one step outside, and you
are in absolutely the deepest...

12:45.732 --> 12:46.775
Shit, Ma.

12:46.984 --> 12:49.778
I don't like that language,
but that's what you'll be in.

12:49.987 --> 12:51.947
- And you, Data...
- "Data".

12:52.155 --> 12:54.908
- Use the back door from now on.
- All right.

12:56.159 --> 12:57.494
What is that?

12:57.995 --> 12:59.413
Oh, shit. What?

13:00.664 --> 13:02.124
What is that?

13:03.333 --> 13:05.502
That is a mess.
I want it cleaned up, boys.

13:05.711 --> 13:08.380
- Oh, yeah. Sure!
- You got it.

13:09.172 --> 13:11.717
One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.927
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.

13:20.142 --> 13:22.603
You want a breathing problem?
You got one.

13:22.811 --> 13:25.314
What'll happen to the stuff
in the attic?

13:25.522 --> 13:27.357
My dad's giving it back
to the museum...

13:27.524 --> 13:31.111
...or the new assistant curly...
Curney...

13:31.528 --> 13:32.571
- Curator.
- Wait, guys.

13:32.779 --> 13:37.534
Maybe there's stuff up there for us
that we can keep from the oldsiders.

13:37.743 --> 13:39.912
Maybe there's some rich stuff!

13:42.414 --> 13:45.208
No! It's my dad's responsibility,
you guys.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.252
The museum's probably got a list.

13:47.461 --> 13:49.546
Listen to me! That's his stuff!

13:55.719 --> 13:59.306
Look at this. I didn't know Dad
had all this stuff up here.

14:00.224 --> 14:03.727
- Great! Look at that! Neat!
- I love it.

14:03.936 --> 14:06.521
Come on, guys!

14:06.730 --> 14:09.066
My dad doesn't want you up here.

14:09.233 --> 14:13.153
You heard what my mom said
about not wanting anybody up here.

14:13.362 --> 14:17.741
I cannot believe you actually have
something this cool in your house.

14:17.908 --> 14:19.284
You guys, my mom said...

14:19.493 --> 14:21.703
Guys, stop. Put down
the outfit, okay?

14:21.912 --> 14:25.499
This is great. We only have Hanukkah
decorations in our attic.

14:25.707 --> 14:27.876
I don't care what you have in your...

14:32.256 --> 14:34.091
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.843
Come on, Mikey. It's cool!

14:37.052 --> 14:39.721
I got you right where I want you!

14:39.930 --> 14:44.226
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up
and you always break something.

14:44.434 --> 14:45.352
Mikey!

14:45.561 --> 14:47.396
Come here and make me feel
like a woman.

14:47.604 --> 14:50.065
Come on, give me a nice, wet,
lickery kiss.

14:52.109 --> 14:55.070
I gotcha! Get out from there,
you're ruining the painting!

14:55.279 --> 14:58.115
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.

15:03.579 --> 15:05.372
- Hey, Mikey?
- What?

15:05.581 --> 15:07.165
What is all this stuff?

15:07.374 --> 15:09.209
The museum did some...
Where'd you get this?

15:09.418 --> 15:12.087
- Right there.
- They did a show. A retropactum.

15:12.421 --> 15:15.883
- Retrospective.
- I said that. Don't contradict me.

15:16.091 --> 15:20.429
It was about the history of Astoria,
and these are the rejects.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.390
Kind of like us, the Goonies.

15:23.599 --> 15:24.892
I'm not a reject.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.811
Take that off.
You'll get me in trouble.

15:28.437 --> 15:30.814
- You know how this works?
- What?

15:31.356 --> 15:32.858
Laser beams!

15:34.651 --> 15:38.155
Mouth, when you drop something,
put it back up...

15:39.072 --> 15:40.240
What's this?

15:41.325 --> 15:42.284
Wait a second.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.092
Chunk!

15:59.760 --> 16:00.677
I didn't touch it.

16:00.844 --> 16:02.262
I know. Get over here.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.102
Hold this.

16:09.311 --> 16:10.854
Why me, Mike?

16:11.063 --> 16:13.774
Thanks for taking us up here.
There's a real big ball...

16:13.982 --> 16:15.400
...and it's got this thing...

16:21.698 --> 16:23.116
What are you doing?

16:23.325 --> 16:24.201
Mike found a map.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.663
And look. That says "1632".

16:27.871 --> 16:29.122
Is that a year?

16:29.331 --> 16:31.333
No. It's your top score
on Pole Position.

16:31.541 --> 16:34.545
Yes, it's a year.
It's a map of our coastline.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.631
What's all that Spanish junk
right there?

16:37.839 --> 16:40.551
Mouth, you said you can translate.
Translate.

16:40.759 --> 16:41.843
Yeah, translate it.

16:43.387 --> 16:47.224
"Ye intruders beware.

16:47.432 --> 16:49.977
Crushing death and grief...

16:51.186 --> 16:55.691
...soaked with blood
of the trespassing thief".

16:55.899 --> 16:57.943
This map is old news.

16:58.151 --> 17:02.614
Everybody went looking for that
when our parents were our age.

17:02.823 --> 17:04.741
Haven't you heard of him?
What's his name?

17:04.907 --> 17:07.368
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.955
One-Eyed Willy!

17:11.164 --> 17:15.460
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.005
Dad'll do anything
to put you to sleep.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.884
No! See, One-Eyed Willy
stole a treasure once.

17:22.092 --> 17:24.928
And it was full of rubies
and emeralds...

17:25.137 --> 17:26.096
And diamonds?

17:26.305 --> 17:30.309
And diamonds. Then he loaded it
onto his ship...

17:30.517 --> 17:32.644
...and sailed away into the sunset.

17:32.853 --> 17:35.314
Until the British king found out
about it...

17:35.522 --> 17:39.026
...and sent out his whole armada
to go after him.

17:39.234 --> 17:42.905
It took them a couple of weeks
to catch up with Willy.

17:43.113 --> 17:45.908
Then there was a whole big war...

17:46.116 --> 17:49.453
...between the armada
and Willy's ship, the Inferno.

17:49.661 --> 17:51.538
During the firefight, there were...

17:51.747 --> 17:54.541
...guns and cannons bursting
here and there.

17:54.750 --> 17:59.171
Then Willy fled, because he knew
he'd get killed if he stayed around.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.632
And then he got into this cave...

18:01.798 --> 18:04.676
...and the British blew up
the walls around him.

18:04.885 --> 18:07.554
He got caved in,
and he's been there ever since.

18:07.763 --> 18:08.764
- Forever?
- Forever.

18:08.972 --> 18:09.973
And ever?

18:10.474 --> 18:11.808
Trapped.

18:14.102 --> 18:16.063
You sound as corny as Dad does.

18:16.647 --> 18:19.191
My dad tells the truth.
Know what he said?

18:19.399 --> 18:23.362
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for years.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.573
They were digging tunnels and caves.

18:26.782 --> 18:28.700
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

18:28.909 --> 18:32.412
Setting booby traps so anybody who
tried to get in would die.

18:32.621 --> 18:34.373
Then he killed all his men.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.333
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?

18:36.541 --> 18:38.252
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.170
Wait a minute.

18:40.379 --> 18:43.715
If he killed all his men,
how did the map get out?

18:43.924 --> 18:48.220
My dad said one of the guys must
have gotten out with the map.

18:48.554 --> 18:52.516
- Hey, Mikey, I believe you.
- I don't believe you at all.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.895
What did you break this time, Chunk?

18:59.439 --> 19:01.441
Hey, you guys, look at this.

19:01.650 --> 19:02.859
You ever hear of this guy?

19:03.068 --> 19:05.654
Chester Copperpot.
Look what it says.

19:05.862 --> 19:10.867
"Chester Copperpot, missing while
in pursuit of local legend.

19:11.201 --> 19:15.539
Reclusive scavenger claims,
'l have the key...

19:15.706 --> 19:19.126
...to One-Eyed Willy".

19:19.334 --> 19:22.212
Wow, do you guys realize
what we could do?

19:22.421 --> 19:26.758
Nobody ever found nothing.
Why would this map be in this attic...

19:26.967 --> 19:29.720
...when it could be in some
safe-deposit box, right?

19:29.928 --> 19:34.725
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't
find it, how would we find it?

19:35.309 --> 19:37.561
But what if? You guys...

19:37.769 --> 19:42.316
...what if this map can lead
to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?

19:42.524 --> 19:43.984
We wouldn't have to leave
the Goon Docks.

19:44.192 --> 19:45.319
Come on, Mike.

19:45.527 --> 19:48.989
I don't want to go on any more
of your Goonie adventures.

19:51.325 --> 19:53.952
Where are you going?
You don't want to do this?

19:59.583 --> 20:01.585
1 632.

20:05.881 --> 20:06.924
Jerk alert.

20:07.132 --> 20:07.966
Can I help you?

20:08.175 --> 20:11.428
Hello, little guys.
I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.

20:11.637 --> 20:14.014
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.

20:14.223 --> 20:15.766
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.

20:16.391 --> 20:17.893
Is your mommy here?

20:18.268 --> 20:22.272
No, she's down at the market buying
Pampers for all us kids.

20:24.441 --> 20:25.734
Papers.

20:25.984 --> 20:30.447
Well, you can give these papers to
your father to read through and sign.

20:31.031 --> 20:33.325
We'll be by to pick them up
in the morning.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.743
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:39.331 --> 20:41.792
- What is that?
- It's Dad's business.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.126
But what is it?

20:43.335 --> 20:45.671
I told you it was Dad's business.

20:47.339 --> 20:49.216
Look at them smiling.

20:50.008 --> 20:54.263
They can't wait till tomorrow
to foreclose on whatever it's called.

20:54.471 --> 20:55.931
Trash the Goon Docks.

20:56.139 --> 20:58.183
I hope they make our house
a sand trap.

20:58.392 --> 21:00.435
And never get their balls out.

21:02.145 --> 21:05.482
You know, I think they made me
lose my appetite.

21:33.886 --> 21:36.680
Come on, before you catch a real cold.

21:41.977 --> 21:43.312
You're sure of yourself.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.397
The foreclosure is a definite.

21:49.484 --> 21:51.737
Oh, God, am I depressed.

21:53.363 --> 21:57.659
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich
stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.

21:57.868 --> 21:59.995
Then he could sleep at night...

22:00.203 --> 22:02.664
...instead of sitting up
figuring how we can stay.

22:02.873 --> 22:04.458
- Me too.
- Me three.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.168
Forget any adventures, limp lungs.

22:06.376 --> 22:10.088
If I let you out, Mom will ground
me, and I've got a date with Andy.

22:10.297 --> 22:13.050
You're dreaming, dude. No way.

22:13.258 --> 22:17.304
Her mom has to drive, and then you
gotta make it with her and her mom.

22:17.512 --> 22:19.181
- Shut up, Mouth.
- Yeah, Mouth.

22:19.389 --> 22:21.058
Shut up, Data.

22:23.602 --> 22:24.728
Jesus!

22:27.272 --> 22:32.236
What'll we do about that country club?
It's killing our parents.

22:33.070 --> 22:34.947
If we don't do something...

22:35.155 --> 22:37.950
...there'll be a golf course
where we're standing.

23:16.780 --> 23:19.074
Brand, how far can you stretch that?

23:19.283 --> 23:21.159
It's not that hard.

23:22.619 --> 23:23.787
Get off me, Chunk.

23:23.996 --> 23:26.540
- Get off me!
- I got you.

23:36.758 --> 23:37.634
What are you doing?

23:38.135 --> 23:41.138
It took his 376 lawn mowing jobs
to pay for it.

23:41.305 --> 23:42.890
It's his favorite thing in the world.

23:43.098 --> 23:45.100
Now it's his flattest.
Let's go!

23:45.309 --> 23:49.313
I'll hit you so hard, when you wake
your clothes will be out of style!

24:09.082 --> 24:11.501
Mom. You've got to let me
out of here.

24:12.336 --> 24:15.464
Can't you learn how to exercise
like a normal kid?

24:15.672 --> 24:20.385
Look! You're hyperventrilicating.
Where's your brother?

24:20.928 --> 24:22.221
Mom!

24:22.429 --> 24:24.056
What's wrong with you people?

24:24.264 --> 24:25.515
Rosalita, come here.

24:25.724 --> 24:28.101
You gotta let me out of here.
Rosalita!

24:30.520 --> 24:33.690
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of this.

24:40.155 --> 24:41.865
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hi, Dad!

24:42.074 --> 24:44.117
Hey, wait for me!

24:50.624 --> 24:55.337
If you don't bring your brother home,
I'll commit Hare Krishna!

24:55.546 --> 24:56.964
That's hara-kiri, Ma.

24:57.172 --> 25:00.342
- That's exactly what I said.
- What?

25:00.551 --> 25:04.805
My new tires!
They popped my new tires, the son of...

25:05.222 --> 25:06.348
I'm gonna kill...

25:10.352 --> 25:12.479
- My bike! My bike!
- I owe you one.

25:12.688 --> 25:14.565
He's got my bike! I want my bike!

25:17.568 --> 25:20.737
Gold Rock Beach is around
this next curve.

25:20.946 --> 25:23.115
I have a feeling about this.

25:23.323 --> 25:26.577
Every time you have feeling,
we get in trouble.

25:26.785 --> 25:30.247
You're the one who always gets us
in trouble, 00-Negative.

25:30.455 --> 25:32.499
I'm James Bond, 007, not 00-Negative.

25:32.708 --> 25:36.336
I'm hungry. When my stomach growls,
there's trouble.

25:36.545 --> 25:37.629
Shut up, Chunk!

25:38.547 --> 25:43.552
You made me go up this big
hill and said give me a Twinkie.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.471
I'll be late for dinner,
and my mom'll yell at me.

25:46.680 --> 25:50.726
She's not gonna let me eat dinner,
and she's gonna punish me!

25:52.352 --> 25:55.606
Anybody got a candy bar?
A Baby Ruth?

25:58.066 --> 26:00.444
I can't believe it. That's it.

26:00.611 --> 26:03.447
Those three rocks out there.
One, two, three.

26:16.210 --> 26:21.548
Troy! You touch that mirror again,
and I'll smack you in the face.

26:23.217 --> 26:24.301
There's Brand.

26:24.509 --> 26:26.303
Like the bike.

26:26.553 --> 26:27.971
What is he doing?

26:28.180 --> 26:30.140
No wonder he can't get a license.

26:32.184 --> 26:33.644
Oh, no.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.819
Brand, can we give you
a ride somewhere?

26:43.028 --> 26:45.572
No. Thanks anyway.

26:46.907 --> 26:49.159
Walsh, let us give you a little ride.

26:49.785 --> 26:51.870
Hold on. Here we go!

26:52.537 --> 26:54.414
- Troy!
- Let go of my arm!

26:57.834 --> 26:58.669
Oh, no.

27:05.008 --> 27:06.051
Let go of my hand!

27:07.761 --> 27:08.929
Oh, my God!

27:09.137 --> 27:10.722
So long, sucker!

27:24.695 --> 27:26.530
- Forget it!
- Come on!

27:28.574 --> 27:31.577
- This better be it, Mikey.
- Shut up, Chunk.

27:36.623 --> 27:37.457
Guys?

27:40.335 --> 27:42.754
I think I have a match.
I'm sure of it.

27:42.963 --> 27:47.175
The lighthouse, the rock and
the restaurant all fit the doubloon.

27:47.718 --> 27:51.430
That must mean the rich stuff
is near the restaurant.

27:51.722 --> 27:53.348
Wait a second.

27:53.724 --> 27:57.686
Mouth, I need you to translate.
I don't understand Spanish.

27:58.395 --> 28:00.355
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

28:02.858 --> 28:04.902
- What's that?
- 10 times 10.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.069
A hundred.

28:06.236 --> 28:07.446
"Stretching feet...

28:07.654 --> 28:10.407
...to nearest northern point".

28:10.616 --> 28:15.412
- Which way is north?
- "That's where you'll find the treat".

28:17.456 --> 28:18.415
That's it!

28:18.624 --> 28:19.708
- That's north.
- Near the restaurant.

28:21.585 --> 28:26.131
One, two, three, four,
five...

28:26.340 --> 28:29.718
...six, seven, eight, nine....

28:37.851 --> 28:39.811
Wait a minute. Somebody's there.

28:45.609 --> 28:47.903
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.

28:48.111 --> 28:50.948
Right to the restaurant.
The rich stuff is there.

28:51.156 --> 28:53.659
I don't know about it, Mikey.

28:55.077 --> 28:56.495
It's getting late.

28:56.703 --> 28:59.915
That's a summer place.
Why is it open in the fall?

29:00.123 --> 29:05.045
There's nothing to be scared of.
Two customers went inside the place.

29:05.254 --> 29:08.507
What if they're not customers?
What if they're drug dealers?

29:08.715 --> 29:10.634
Drug dealers?

29:12.010 --> 29:16.974
Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers don't wear polyester rags.

29:21.019 --> 29:23.855
Mikey, Mikey!
That sounded like gunshots.

29:24.064 --> 29:28.485
Not the kind you hear in movies,
but real ones. They're gonna kill us.

29:28.694 --> 29:31.780
Turn off your brain.
Somebody dropped a pot.

29:31.989 --> 29:32.990
Yeah, a pot!

29:34.575 --> 29:38.161
Are you sure, Mikey?
Because if you're sure, I'm sure.

29:38.370 --> 29:41.832
If it's not the pots,
they might try to kill us.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.793
They're gonna kill us!

29:46.461 --> 29:48.422
Chunk, shut up!

29:58.390 --> 30:01.643
Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!

30:02.352 --> 30:03.228
Damn it!

30:03.770 --> 30:04.855
What's that?

30:05.063 --> 30:06.857
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

30:09.192 --> 30:11.445
The cook is carrying something
to the kitchen.

30:11.653 --> 30:13.322
Yeah, food.

30:13.697 --> 30:14.823
Don't let them see us.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.293
ORV.

30:27.336 --> 30:28.587
Bullet holes.

30:30.214 --> 30:31.757
Bullet holes?!

30:38.972 --> 30:39.723
Shut up, Chunk.

30:44.228 --> 30:48.357
This is a summer restaurant? I bet
it hasn't been open in 10 summers.

30:48.565 --> 30:51.360
How long you boys been at that window?

30:51.693 --> 30:56.031
Long enough to see you need about
400 roach motels in this place.

30:57.241 --> 31:01.078
How am I supposed to create
with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!

31:10.546 --> 31:13.632
Jake, these boys are customers.

31:27.771 --> 31:28.480
Boys...

31:29.773 --> 31:31.525
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?

31:35.404 --> 31:37.239
She's gonna cook you something.

31:37.823 --> 31:39.366
What do you want?

31:40.742 --> 31:42.744
- Lots of water.
- Water, water, water.

31:42.911 --> 31:45.581
Four waters. Is that all?

31:45.873 --> 31:47.207
No.

31:47.499 --> 31:49.710
I want veal scallopini.

31:49.918 --> 31:52.629
I want a good fettucini Alfredo.

31:53.380 --> 31:57.050
A bottle of fettucine, 1981.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.263
The only thing we serve is tongue.

32:06.935 --> 32:08.729
You boys like tongue?

32:13.609 --> 32:14.818
That's all?

32:18.280 --> 32:19.489
Sit down!

32:23.035 --> 32:24.578
Are you all right, Chunk?

32:26.163 --> 32:27.748
Hey, guys.

32:28.457 --> 32:32.252
What happened to the two guys
in the polyester who came before us?

32:32.461 --> 32:35.297
- What happened to them?
- What is it? Spit it out.

32:35.464 --> 32:37.799
You guys, if we don't
get out of here soon...

32:38.008 --> 32:41.220
...there's gonna be
some kind of hostage crisis.

32:43.180 --> 32:46.934
Out in the garage, ORV,
four-wheel drive...

32:47.142 --> 32:49.269
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba...

32:49.478 --> 32:53.607
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D.
on all your bullshit stories.

32:55.317 --> 32:56.318
Here's your water.

32:56.526 --> 32:58.737
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.

32:59.029 --> 33:00.030
I mean "ma'am".

33:00.239 --> 33:01.949
This is supposed to be water?

33:02.157 --> 33:04.034
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!

33:04.243 --> 33:05.953
Where's the men's room, please?

33:06.161 --> 33:07.788
- Can't you hold it?
- No.

33:07.996 --> 33:12.042
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place
you want to go to the bathroom in.

33:12.501 --> 33:14.044
Why not?

33:14.336 --> 33:16.964
Because they might have
daddy longlegs in them.

33:17.172 --> 33:20.175
- But I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Like dead things, Mikey.

33:20.384 --> 33:23.428
Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?

33:23.637 --> 33:26.515
- Killer dead things. Big. Please.
- Lady, please!

33:26.682 --> 33:29.393
- Downstairs, first door on the right.
- Thank you.

33:29.601 --> 33:32.521
- Stay to the right!
- Please, Mikey, dead things.

33:32.729 --> 33:34.231
Stay to the right!

33:34.523 --> 33:36.900
I know it's to the right, thank you.

33:41.572 --> 33:45.242
I know you're down here,
One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.

33:46.410 --> 33:49.413
I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy.
I know you're down here.

33:52.875 --> 33:55.210
Oh, man, that stinks.

33:58.881 --> 34:00.465
What the hell is that?

34:18.775 --> 34:21.737
You're ruining it!
Look at the feast I made you.

34:21.945 --> 34:24.447
Look at the feast I made you.
Want to eat it?

34:24.656 --> 34:28.952
Have some. You'll get something.
You don't leave me any choice.

34:29.161 --> 34:30.871
You don't leave me any choice!

34:33.581 --> 34:36.752
You're just like Mom and Francis.
You never let me finish.

35:26.635 --> 35:30.764
Why can't you stay at home?
I'm taking you out of here right now.

35:30.973 --> 35:32.391
Let's get out of here!

35:33.475 --> 35:35.060
Get out of here!

35:36.895 --> 35:38.438
And stay out!

35:46.488 --> 35:48.031
Kids suck.

35:50.450 --> 35:53.036
I swear on my life, they've got it.

35:53.245 --> 35:56.373
An It! A giant It!
They got it chained to the wall!

35:56.582 --> 36:00.294
- The parts were all mixed around.
- Like your brain?

36:02.629 --> 36:04.006
Say goodbye to your pals.

36:04.089 --> 36:04.631
Hey, look at that.

36:06.008 --> 36:08.594
- Ma, why'd you have to shoot him?
- He's a fed.

36:08.802 --> 36:12.681
We could've taken him to the side
of a road and shot him in the brain.

36:12.848 --> 36:16.310
- Bring him over here, Francis.
- Don't give me "over here".

36:16.852 --> 36:19.062
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?

36:19.271 --> 36:20.898
Restaurant trash. Yeah.

36:21.106 --> 36:23.775
You sure? That big? That much?

36:23.984 --> 36:27.154
There were bullet holes
in the car this big.

36:27.362 --> 36:30.073
Mikey, come on,
our parents are worried.

36:30.282 --> 36:35.120
- It's dinnertime. Let's go home.
- Home? What home?

36:35.329 --> 36:38.373
In a couple more hours
it ain't gonna be home anymore.

36:38.582 --> 36:41.376
Come on, guys, this is our time.

36:41.585 --> 36:44.755
Our last chance to see
if there really is any rich stuff.

36:47.049 --> 36:48.425
We've got to.

36:50.636 --> 36:52.054
Get down, guys. Get down.

36:56.558 --> 36:58.352
Oh, shit!

36:58.560 --> 37:01.897
You guys scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack!

37:02.105 --> 37:06.235
- You look better from behind, Mouth.
- Want to see something really scary?

37:06.443 --> 37:08.362
How did you get here?

37:08.570 --> 37:12.157
We followed you guys.
We were out driving with Troy.

37:12.574 --> 37:15.994
- Sorry about your face.
- It's okay, I was born with it.

37:16.203 --> 37:19.331
- I'm kidding.
- Anyway, he was being a jerk.

37:19.540 --> 37:22.668
Tilting the mirror
so he could look down my shirt.

37:22.876 --> 37:26.255
- So I elbowed his lip.
- You elbowed his lip?

37:27.881 --> 37:29.591
- It's locked.
- Thank God!

37:29.800 --> 37:30.801
Wait a minute!

37:31.009 --> 37:34.680
You know, I got some naked pictures
of your mom, taking a bath.

37:35.264 --> 37:36.848
- Want to buy them?
- What?!

37:37.057 --> 37:38.684
Real cheap.

37:42.062 --> 37:43.564
Thanks, Chunk.

37:46.066 --> 37:49.319
- Wait here. I'll get my brother.
- You'll get in trouble.

37:49.528 --> 37:52.698
- Just don't leave, all right?
- No way I'm staying here.

37:56.869 --> 37:59.955
Shut up! We got to get
to the lowest point of the floor.

38:00.163 --> 38:02.541
Lowest point, nothing.
Let's go. Now!

38:04.960 --> 38:07.045
Oh, my God!

38:08.422 --> 38:10.257
- No, Brandon.
- Mikey!

38:18.682 --> 38:20.893
- Oh, my God.
- It was disgusting.

38:21.101 --> 38:24.313
It jumped out from the bushes.
I swear it almost killed us.

38:24.521 --> 38:28.191
Please? What if we find something?
A few more minutes won't hurt.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.402
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.

38:30.611 --> 38:34.406
- Brand, give them a few minutes.
- Listen to your big brother.

38:34.615 --> 38:37.201
As long as you stay here with me.

38:38.285 --> 38:41.747
- She knows what she's talking about.
- She's a dame!

38:54.593 --> 38:57.012
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.265
That's the It.

39:00.891 --> 39:02.726
Sounds like Kong.

39:03.185 --> 39:04.895
Part of it's human.

39:05.395 --> 39:07.731
Come on. Want to see it?

39:08.190 --> 39:10.817
Don't worry.
It's chained to the wall.

39:28.335 --> 39:30.837
- I don't want to go.
- Why not? It's chained.

39:31.004 --> 39:33.549
- Why not? It's chained.
- You wanted to go.

39:33.757 --> 39:35.884
- Yeah, I wanted to go.
- So let's go.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.596
I don't want to see it.

39:57.698 --> 40:00.617
- Shame, shame!
- I know your name.

40:00.826 --> 40:03.036
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.

40:03.245 --> 40:06.039
That's disgusting.
No, I can't even look.

40:06.748 --> 40:08.959
Get me up, guys!

40:09.167 --> 40:11.920
One, two, three.

40:12.421 --> 40:13.714
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

40:13.881 --> 40:17.926
Can't you smell it, guys?
One-Eyed Willy really is down here.

40:18.927 --> 40:20.804
We're walking right above...

40:21.013 --> 40:23.640
I'm gonna build one like this one.

40:23.849 --> 40:25.225
Water.

40:26.226 --> 40:28.687
- Come on, we can do it.
- No, wait a minute.

40:29.187 --> 40:34.067
Right about here must've been when we
said we gotta get to the lowest spot.

40:34.568 --> 40:37.195
What are you two talking
to each other about, Mikey?

40:38.030 --> 40:41.742
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to lose your fist!

40:41.909 --> 40:44.244
What are you doing? Give me that.

40:44.411 --> 40:47.623
There's nothing buried there.
This is the 20th century!

40:47.831 --> 40:50.792
- The map says there is.
- Get off it! There's nothing...

40:51.001 --> 40:52.920
Lookit! I got an idea.

40:53.128 --> 40:56.924
Let's put chocolate all over the floor
and let Chunk eat through it.

40:57.132 --> 41:00.594
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.

41:00.761 --> 41:04.389
And I can't stand no more!
I got it! I got it! I got it!

41:06.016 --> 41:08.560
- I don't got it.
- You klutz.

41:09.019 --> 41:10.771
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.

41:10.938 --> 41:12.564
This is ridiculous.

41:12.773 --> 41:16.109
I feel like I'm babysitting,
except I'm not getting paid.

41:16.818 --> 41:18.362
- Listen to that.
- What?

41:22.741 --> 41:25.953
Sounds like my grandfather
taking a leak. Thrillsville.

41:26.161 --> 41:27.371
No, it's deep.

41:27.579 --> 41:31.792
Like there's a hole
or a passageway. Real deep.

41:32.376 --> 41:33.627
Get out of the way.

41:34.503 --> 41:37.172
- Brand is being so sweet to me.
- Oh, come on!

41:39.258 --> 41:41.510
You're in the clouds,
and we are in a basement!

41:45.722 --> 41:47.975
I told you!

41:48.183 --> 41:49.768
Told you! I told you!

41:52.604 --> 41:55.774
I can feel the air.
There's something down there.

41:55.983 --> 41:57.943
It might be a treasure or something.

42:01.154 --> 42:02.948
Hey, this is working, guys.

42:05.659 --> 42:08.036
- Brand, careful!
- Are you okay?

42:08.245 --> 42:10.372
I told you there was a passageway.

42:10.706 --> 42:13.542
- It's the start of the tunnel.
- Look.

42:25.012 --> 42:26.638
Fifty-dollar bill.

42:26.847 --> 42:28.140
Fifty-dollar bill. Fifty-dollar bill?

42:29.433 --> 42:31.143
Did he say, "Fifty-dollar bill"?

42:31.351 --> 42:32.227
Fifty-dollar bills!

42:34.313 --> 42:38.191
Hundreds of them!
We have money to save the Goon Docks!

42:45.657 --> 42:46.950
Quiet!

42:47.534 --> 42:49.912
They're fake. They're bogus.
They're phony.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.831
I knew these people
were from the ozone.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.084
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!

42:56.335 --> 42:59.504
- I recognize these people.
- Look, it's the Fratellis.

42:59.713 --> 43:02.341
- He was upstairs!
- The guy who tried to sing.

43:02.549 --> 43:04.384
You guys never listen to me.

43:04.593 --> 43:07.721
I said there would be trouble,
but you didn't listen.

43:07.930 --> 43:11.183
You guys are crazy.
You guys are self-destructive.

43:11.391 --> 43:14.519
There's a funny farm
with your names written all over it.

43:14.728 --> 43:16.939
But I'm getting out of here. But...

43:18.607 --> 43:20.359
I smell ice cream.

43:23.570 --> 43:24.863
They got Swenson's.

43:25.530 --> 43:28.784
They got Pralines and Cream.
And they got Mississippi Mud.

43:28.992 --> 43:31.036
And they got Chocolate Eruption!

43:31.703 --> 43:33.872
And they got apple!

43:34.373 --> 43:35.707
And they got grape!

43:35.916 --> 43:39.753
They got grape and Super-Duper
Chocolate Eruption and...

43:39.962 --> 43:41.171
What, what?

43:52.391 --> 43:53.850
It's a stiff!

43:57.980 --> 43:59.231
The door!

44:13.537 --> 44:16.081
- Somebody's been here. Door's open.
- Shut it.

44:16.290 --> 44:18.917
- I'm gonna leave the lights on.
- Calm down.

44:23.964 --> 44:25.424
Pizza.

44:26.842 --> 44:28.427
Pepperoni.

44:29.887 --> 44:33.181
- Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again.
- You want your pepperoni?

44:35.100 --> 44:37.352
Let's kill each other
over the pepperoni.

44:37.561 --> 44:40.355
Put that gun away now!

44:40.856 --> 44:42.608
You always take his side.

44:42.816 --> 44:44.026
That's right.

44:48.530 --> 44:49.740
Put him back.

44:56.121 --> 44:58.749
- Okay, close the door.
- We can go, guys.

45:01.835 --> 45:03.962
Mikey? Mikey, come on.

45:05.297 --> 45:07.341
The fireplace is the only way out.

45:07.549 --> 45:10.510
- You guys will never get out that way.
- What?

45:14.556 --> 45:16.642
It all starts here.

45:24.149 --> 45:26.485
Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!

45:28.987 --> 45:31.323
Stay. Stay.

45:31.532 --> 45:34.409
Guys, come here!
He's in here! Oh, shit.

45:34.618 --> 45:36.995
- Come on, let's go.
- Faster, guys.

45:39.790 --> 45:42.459
- Half the pepperoni was mine.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

45:42.668 --> 45:45.837
Help! Help! Help! Guys!

45:46.046 --> 45:49.007
- Come on, you idiots!
- Okay, Ma.

45:50.342 --> 45:52.844
- I'll make sure it's safe.
- Shut up.

45:53.053 --> 45:55.472
- Safe.
- Shut up and go.

45:55.681 --> 45:57.099
Hurry up!

46:00.018 --> 46:03.021
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!

46:10.946 --> 46:12.781
I'll show you that piece that...

46:13.073 --> 46:15.659
He says that all the time.
Watch your head, Ma.

46:15.868 --> 46:17.953
- I can't find Chunk.
- Where's Chunk?

46:20.205 --> 46:22.499
- Where's Chunk?
- Chunk's up there.

46:23.417 --> 46:26.378
- Look at this piece over here.
- Leave it alone, Jake.

46:26.879 --> 46:30.215
Ma, I don't want him to touch it.
I worked two hours on it...

46:30.424 --> 46:32.551
- You worked one.
- Shut up!

46:33.760 --> 46:37.598
Someone's been here. The cooler's
broken. Go check your brother.

46:37.806 --> 46:40.976
- It could've been a tremor, Ma.
- I'll show you a tremor.

46:42.644 --> 46:44.187
I'll go check the brother.

46:44.396 --> 46:47.941
If he broke his chains,
I'm not getting any more from the zoo.

46:48.150 --> 46:50.402
- Ma, just don't upset yourself.
- Hurry up!

46:53.071 --> 46:54.364
Gesundheit.

46:58.827 --> 47:00.245
I'm cold.

47:02.623 --> 47:05.125
Chunk. Chunk, come here.

47:06.877 --> 47:08.921
What are you doing down there?

47:12.424 --> 47:13.759
Go get the police.

47:13.967 --> 47:17.179
We're in serious shit here.
You gotta get the police.

47:17.387 --> 47:18.847
Don't worry, I can do it.

47:19.389 --> 47:21.308
Go, get out of here.

47:25.270 --> 47:26.939
Watch it... Oh, the window.

47:31.318 --> 47:33.445
- Did you see him, guys?
- Where's Chunk?

47:33.654 --> 47:36.740
- He went to get the police.
- Go, the Fratellis are there.

47:36.949 --> 47:38.825
He's getting the police. Move!

47:39.034 --> 47:41.411
See, Ma?
There was nothing to worry about.

47:41.620 --> 47:44.748
I knew he couldn't break them chains.

47:44.957 --> 47:45.916
Get the body.

47:47.084 --> 47:50.087
We've been walking forever.
How much further is it?

47:50.295 --> 47:52.005
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.

47:52.214 --> 47:54.800
Now I dropped my glasses.
I can't see a thing.

47:55.008 --> 47:56.468
Oh, my God.

47:56.677 --> 47:59.137
- I found your glasses. Sorry.
- You broke them.

47:59.346 --> 48:01.223
You broke my glasses!

48:01.431 --> 48:05.227
Listen, I'm the oldest,
so I'm in charge. First, we'll...

48:05.561 --> 48:07.521
Data, do you have a light?

48:07.688 --> 48:11.066
I said I was in charge.
Data, do you have a light?

48:12.150 --> 48:15.487
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.

48:17.030 --> 48:18.907
Bully Blinders!

48:19.283 --> 48:22.327
- All right, Data... Ow!
- Isn't that neat?

48:22.536 --> 48:27.291
One day I was walking home with it,
and two big guys stopped me...

48:27.583 --> 48:31.420
Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you.
Watch out. Data!

48:31.628 --> 48:32.921
Come on, turn it off.

48:33.130 --> 48:38.093
Oh, Data. The only problem is
the batteries don't last so long.

48:38.594 --> 48:43.181
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we
can get out that way. Let's go.

48:43.473 --> 48:47.311
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I like the dark. I love it.

48:47.519 --> 48:50.689
But I hate nature. I hate nature!

48:51.064 --> 48:53.692
Wait a sec! Hold it!

48:53.942 --> 48:56.570
Stop! I'm just a kid!

48:59.323 --> 49:02.326
- What seems to be the problem?
- Mister, I need a ride.

49:02.576 --> 49:05.495
My friends and I had
a run-in with disgusting people.

49:05.704 --> 49:09.458
You might've heard of them, the
Fratellis. We found their hideout.

49:09.666 --> 49:14.671
Could you take me to the sheriff?
I can describe all three of them.

49:38.278 --> 49:39.404
Will you...

49:42.616 --> 49:46.245
What the hell? He's only a kid.
Can't you handle a kid, even?

49:48.539 --> 49:50.958
- Does it work, guys?
- Yeah!

49:52.125 --> 49:56.838
I can't see. Mouth, your father's
a plumber. What are these pipes?

49:57.297 --> 49:59.925
These look like water pipes, guys.

50:00.133 --> 50:01.802
Gas pipes.

50:02.719 --> 50:06.640
Drainage. Maybe... Wait a minute.
Shut up for a minute!

50:06.848 --> 50:11.311
These pipes must lead to a building
or something. A foundation.

50:11.478 --> 50:15.524
So maybe if we bang on them hard
enough, if we make enough noise....

50:51.226 --> 50:52.644
How are you, Duke?

50:52.853 --> 50:54.813
- Hey, Gene, how are you?
- Great.

51:26.887 --> 51:28.847
Reverse pressure!

51:35.354 --> 51:36.521
Daddy!

51:36.730 --> 51:37.689
- Let's...
- Get out of...

51:37.898 --> 51:39.775
- Here!
- Like now!

51:42.527 --> 51:43.987
Go, go, go!

52:02.047 --> 52:04.550
First, we start with
the pudgy little fingers.

52:04.758 --> 52:07.261
Then the plump little hands.

52:07.427 --> 52:09.888
Then the fleshy arms.

52:11.765 --> 52:13.976
Now, tell me where your friends are.

52:14.184 --> 52:15.185
In the fireplace.

52:15.394 --> 52:16.520
Don't lie to me!

52:16.728 --> 52:20.399
Honestly. We found a map
over at Mikey's dad's place...

52:20.607 --> 52:23.735
...that said there was
buried treasure under here.

52:23.944 --> 52:26.697
Don't give us none of
your bullshit stories, huh?

52:27.698 --> 52:30.200
Spill your guts. Tell us everything.

52:30.409 --> 52:31.702
Everything?

52:32.286 --> 52:33.245
Everything.

52:34.580 --> 52:37.249
Okay, I'll talk.

52:37.958 --> 52:40.919
In 3rd grade,
I cheated on my history exam.

52:41.128 --> 52:44.756
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's
toupee and glued it on my face...

52:44.965 --> 52:47.342
...when I played Moses
in my Hebrew school play.

52:47.551 --> 52:52.389
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister
down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

52:53.724 --> 52:56.852
Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?

52:57.060 --> 52:58.061
Oh, brother.

52:58.312 --> 53:02.107
Look, a lantern. Somebody must
have been here before us.

53:02.316 --> 53:04.359
- Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.

53:04.568 --> 53:06.069
Look at these cigarettes.

53:11.283 --> 53:16.121
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

53:16.330 --> 53:18.624
If I'd been smart,
he'd still be looking.

53:18.832 --> 53:21.001
- Listen to her.
- What's wrong with her?

53:21.335 --> 53:23.629
- Andy, it's okay.
- Is she all right?

53:28.800 --> 53:32.429
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

53:32.638 --> 53:34.181
You've got a great body.

53:34.389 --> 53:38.227
How many years do I have before l
get fat? Before my hair falls out?

53:38.435 --> 53:40.354
Before I look like him?

53:44.566 --> 53:49.029
Then my mom sent me
to a summer camp for fat kids.

53:49.238 --> 53:52.574
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts
and I pigged out...

53:52.783 --> 53:54.117
...and they kicked me out!

53:57.871 --> 54:00.332
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.

54:02.042 --> 54:04.962
This is one of your tricks,
right, One-Eyed Willy?

54:07.631 --> 54:11.635
You must be really hiding something
to go through all this trouble.

54:11.885 --> 54:15.138
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!

54:15.347 --> 54:16.640
Don't be afraid.

54:19.726 --> 54:23.480
He's dead for sure.
I think he's Chester Copperpot.

54:23.689 --> 54:25.023
- Chester who?
- Who?

54:25.232 --> 54:28.485
Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?

54:28.694 --> 54:31.196
The last guy to look
for the rich stuff...

54:31.405 --> 54:34.366
...he went in,
but he never came back out.

54:34.575 --> 54:36.618
That was back in 1935.

54:36.827 --> 54:41.290
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

54:41.498 --> 54:43.000
How will we get out?

54:43.250 --> 54:45.627
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?

54:45.836 --> 54:48.338
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?

54:48.839 --> 54:50.549
We can't be sure it's him.

54:50.757 --> 54:51.800
I know it's him.

54:52.009 --> 54:55.095
I bet his I.D. is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.

54:57.681 --> 54:59.141
Lou Gehrig?

54:59.725 --> 55:02.895
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.

55:09.026 --> 55:11.361
It is Chester Copperpot.

55:12.446 --> 55:14.990
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.

55:15.199 --> 55:17.367
We're gonna get killed too.

55:17.826 --> 55:19.369
Hey, look at this.

55:19.745 --> 55:20.913
Candles.

55:23.916 --> 55:27.085
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?

55:27.711 --> 55:29.796
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

55:30.005 --> 55:33.842
That's what I said. I'll set booby
traps in case anyone follows us...

55:34.051 --> 55:36.345
...like the Fratellis.
We'll hear them coming.

55:36.553 --> 55:38.222
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.

55:38.430 --> 55:40.682
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.

55:40.891 --> 55:44.645
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!

55:44.853 --> 55:46.730
God, these guys....

55:49.733 --> 55:54.613
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton
of One-Eyed Willy or something.

55:54.821 --> 55:56.740
Give me that. Give me this thing.

56:03.580 --> 56:06.083
Oh, God! There's no way out of here.

56:06.375 --> 56:08.335
No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.

56:10.796 --> 56:12.714
Hey, guys, now that we've got...

56:16.677 --> 56:19.054
Look at this. See what I found?

56:30.524 --> 56:32.150
Guys, freeze. Don't move.

56:32.359 --> 56:35.946
Don't move. You guys,
don't move back there! Don't move!

56:36.154 --> 56:37.698
- What?
- Freeze!

56:41.577 --> 56:43.328
Run, you guys, run!

56:48.959 --> 56:50.836
Holy shit!

57:15.527 --> 57:17.196
Man, that was close.

57:17.404 --> 57:20.199
Wait, listen. Sounds like
somebody's down there.

57:29.166 --> 57:30.250
Shut up and listen.

57:30.459 --> 57:32.753
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Or the Fratellis.

57:32.961 --> 57:36.757
- Or Chunk got the police.
- Or one of Willy's booby traps.

57:41.553 --> 57:44.306
God put that rock there for a purpose.

57:44.514 --> 57:47.809
I'm not so sure you should
move it or anything.

57:49.686 --> 57:50.979
Hello?

57:54.942 --> 57:56.068
Bats!

58:03.367 --> 58:04.952
Save me! They're in my hair.

58:05.160 --> 58:07.496
Help! Rabies! Rabies!

58:09.831 --> 58:11.291
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!

58:13.502 --> 58:18.382
But the worst thing I ever done,
I mixed up fake puke at home...

58:18.590 --> 58:23.178
...and I went to this movie theater,
hid the puke in my jacket...

58:23.387 --> 58:26.014
...climbed up to the balcony...

58:26.223 --> 58:29.101
...and then I made a noise like this...

58:38.527 --> 58:40.946
And then I dumped it over the side...

58:41.572 --> 58:44.283
...on all the people
in the audience. Then...

58:44.491 --> 58:46.577
Then this was horrible.

58:46.827 --> 58:51.331
All the people started getting sick
and throwing up on each other.

58:51.540 --> 58:54.585
I never felt so bad in my entire life.

58:54.793 --> 58:56.461
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.

58:56.670 --> 58:58.171
Hit puree.

58:58.630 --> 59:00.215
No, I'm too young!

59:01.008 --> 59:03.677
No! I want to play the violin!

59:03.886 --> 59:06.179
- Not my hand!
- Do I get the truth?

59:06.680 --> 59:09.683
Do I get the truth,
or do you get juiced?

59:11.685 --> 59:14.021
- What was that noise?
- Fireplace blew.

59:14.229 --> 59:17.774
The kid's not kidding, Ma.
There's a tunnel down there.

59:19.193 --> 59:22.446
Watch your hair!
They're going for the hair!

59:23.822 --> 59:24.948
Watch your veins, Ma!

59:25.157 --> 59:28.994
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!

59:29.203 --> 59:30.370
Run! They're coming after you!

59:32.122 --> 59:35.834
Hey, If we keep going this
far down, we'll reach China.

59:36.043 --> 59:38.670
Maybe I can go see
my auntie or something.

59:41.048 --> 59:43.050
This could get dangerous, Andy.

59:43.258 --> 59:45.594
- You might want to hold my hand.
- Thank you.

59:47.679 --> 59:50.057
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, neat!

59:50.265 --> 59:51.975
- That's beautiful.
- Guys, look!

59:52.184 --> 59:54.144
It's a beautiful waterfall!

01:00:21.421 --> 01:00:24.800
- Wow! It's a giant piggy bank!
- We're rich!

01:00:25.008 --> 01:00:26.009
We found it!

01:00:26.218 --> 01:00:30.013
- Gold and silver all over the place!
- It's gold, we did it!

01:00:30.222 --> 01:00:31.431
Hold the lantern.

01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:34.017
Coins! Rich stuff.

01:00:34.601 --> 01:00:36.395
What year was the map made?

01:00:36.562 --> 01:00:37.563
I don't know.

01:00:37.771 --> 01:00:41.984
Probably a couple hundred years
before President Lincoln.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:44.444
George Washington.

01:00:45.863 --> 01:00:50.075
- Martin Sheen.
- That's President Kennedy, you idiot!

01:00:50.284 --> 01:00:53.537
Well, same difference! I mean,
he played Kennedy once.

01:00:53.745 --> 01:00:56.373
That's smart. I'm glad
you're using your brain.

01:00:56.582 --> 01:00:59.877
- At least I have a brain!
- You're so stupid, Mouth.

01:01:00.085 --> 01:01:01.670
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

01:01:02.754 --> 01:01:04.882
Shut up! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.427
This isn't gold. This is
a wishing well. Look.

01:01:08.594 --> 01:01:11.513
Hey, it must be the old
Moss Garden wishing well.

01:01:11.722 --> 01:01:16.518
I used to believe when you threw
money in, it turned into your wish.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:19.271
- I'll take two of your coins.
- That's not fair.

01:01:19.479 --> 01:01:24.484
- Wait, wait, wait, you can't do this.
- Why?

01:01:24.735 --> 01:01:27.029
Because these are
somebody else's wishes.

01:01:27.237 --> 01:01:29.615
They're somebody else's dreams.

01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:33.952
Yeah, but you know what?

01:01:34.745 --> 01:01:37.623
This one, this one right here...

01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:40.459
...this was my dream, my wish.

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:44.463
And it didn't come true.
So I'm taking it back.

01:01:44.755 --> 01:01:46.757
I'm taking them all back.

01:01:49.968 --> 01:01:53.722
Come on, One-Eyed Willy, what does
this have to do with the map?

01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:56.225
Is this another one of your tricks?

01:01:56.558 --> 01:01:59.436
Maybe we should keep him alive
in case he isn't lying.

01:01:59.645 --> 01:02:03.148
Good idea, Jake. Put him in
with your brother.

01:02:03.357 --> 01:02:04.358
Okay, Ma.

01:02:05.108 --> 01:02:06.235
Come on, kid.

01:02:08.111 --> 01:02:10.405
- You dropped something.
- What's that?

01:02:13.242 --> 01:02:15.953
- Holy shit.
- We found it on the map.

01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:18.330
It has to do with the buried treasure.

01:02:18.539 --> 01:02:21.083
Jake, look at the date on it.

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:23.377
This is an authentic doubloon.

01:02:23.585 --> 01:02:25.212
Give it to me.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.922
I told you so.

01:02:27.172 --> 01:02:32.135
See, you guys? You never believed me.
I said there was gonna be buried...

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.810
Troy, how far you got with Andy?

01:02:40.018 --> 01:02:41.603
All the way, buddy?

01:02:42.145 --> 01:02:44.314
You guys are so immature. Grow up.

01:02:44.523 --> 01:02:47.150
- Come on, tell us.
- Really.

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:50.070
Put it this way:
I didn't make it with her yet.

01:02:50.279 --> 01:02:52.364
And I stress "yet".

01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:57.244
What the hell?

01:02:57.536 --> 01:03:01.164
- What'd you wish for?
- To make it with Andy.

01:03:05.419 --> 01:03:07.379
Hey, who's down there?

01:03:08.505 --> 01:03:10.340
Hey, guys, it's Troy!

01:03:12.426 --> 01:03:13.594
Sounds like Andy.

01:03:13.802 --> 01:03:15.137
Andy!

01:03:15.888 --> 01:03:16.972
Is that you?

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.934
Yeah, it's me. We're stuck down here.
Please send down the bucket.

01:03:21.143 --> 01:03:24.062
What the hell are you doing
at the bottom of a well?

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:29.276
Don't ask stupid questions! We're
stuck! Just send down the bucket!

01:03:30.152 --> 01:03:33.447
See, guys? Wishes do come true.

01:03:34.781 --> 01:03:36.992
All right, my hearties, follow me!

01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:45.292
Don't worry. I brought you more food.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.628
Why are you locking me in here?

01:03:47.836 --> 01:03:50.047
- You're not too tight.
- Yes, it is.

01:03:50.255 --> 01:03:52.591
If you get out, I'll break your legs.

01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:55.052
What are you doing?

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.013
If you sit too close to the TV,
you'll screw up your eye.

01:03:59.097 --> 01:04:00.849
Jake, leave him alone!

01:04:07.105 --> 01:04:08.899
Come on! Let me out.

01:04:17.824 --> 01:04:21.787
Hi, sir. My name's Lawrence.

01:04:22.037 --> 01:04:24.623
Sometimes people call me Chunk.

01:04:35.259 --> 01:04:37.302
Help! Let me out of here!

01:04:37.636 --> 01:04:39.137
Who knows what we'll find.

01:04:39.346 --> 01:04:40.597
Okay, let's go.

01:04:40.806 --> 01:04:44.643
Whoa, look at this.
Look how deep it is down there.

01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:46.019
Jake, you first.

01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:47.980
I ain't gonna go first.

01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:51.316
- Go!
- Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.

01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:53.360
Troy, throw the bucket down.

01:04:54.736 --> 01:04:57.656
Hey, you guys, I'm the smallest.
I want to go first.

01:04:57.823 --> 01:05:02.452
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I call
the shots. Andy goes first.

01:05:02.661 --> 01:05:04.371
Chester Copperpot.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.498
Chester Copperpot.

01:05:06.957 --> 01:05:08.292
Chester Copperpot!

01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:10.377
Don't you see?

01:05:10.919 --> 01:05:15.007
Don't you realize? He was a pro!
He never made it this far.

01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:18.260
Look how far we've come.
We've got a chance.

01:05:18.677 --> 01:05:21.471
Chance at what, Mikey?
Getting killed?

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.685
Look, if we keep going, someone's
really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.

01:05:27.019 --> 01:05:28.562
We've got to get the police.

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:30.355
Maybe Chunk got the police.

01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:31.773
Maybe Chunk is dead.

01:05:31.982 --> 01:05:36.320
Don't say that. Never say that.
Goonies never say "die"!

01:05:37.487 --> 01:05:41.074
I'm not a Goonie. I want to go home.

01:05:43.202 --> 01:05:46.038
I forgot. But still!

01:05:46.705 --> 01:05:50.667
Don't you realize?
The next time you see the sky...

01:05:51.877 --> 01:05:53.962
...it'll be over another town.

01:05:54.922 --> 01:05:57.132
The next time we take a test...

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.762
...it'll be in some other school.

01:06:03.347 --> 01:06:07.142
Our parents, they want
the best of stuff for us.

01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:10.562
Now they got to do
what's right for them.

01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:13.732
Because it's their time. Their time!

01:06:14.233 --> 01:06:15.275
Up there.

01:06:16.026 --> 01:06:20.280
Down here it's our time.
It's our time down here.

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:25.702
That's all over the second
we ride up Troy's bucket.

01:07:07.035 --> 01:07:08.704
Andy!

01:07:09.371 --> 01:07:10.998
You Goonie!

01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:14.084
Spread it around.

01:07:15.127 --> 01:07:17.713
You try to make your frosting
look rugged.

01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:19.548
Chocolate.

01:07:21.633 --> 01:07:24.261
Chocolate.

01:07:26.138 --> 01:07:29.141
Want a candy bar?
Look, I got a Baby Ruth.

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:30.601
Sir?

01:07:33.145 --> 01:07:37.816
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Baby Ruth.

01:07:38.025 --> 01:07:39.568
I'm gonna throw it to you.

01:07:49.828 --> 01:07:52.956
I'm sorry, sir!
I tried to give it to you.

01:07:53.165 --> 01:07:54.541
Oh, I'm sorry!

01:07:55.167 --> 01:07:58.629
I'm really sorry.
I'll get you a... I'll get you a...

01:08:19.733 --> 01:08:23.694
Jeez, mister, you're even hungrier
than I am.

01:08:27.032 --> 01:08:30.536
Booby traps. It's only booby traps.
Why you being such a sissy?

01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:32.162
Freaking kids.

01:08:39.545 --> 01:08:42.714
- Kids must've cleaned him out.
- Right before they ate him.

01:08:42.923 --> 01:08:43.966
Stupid.

01:08:48.386 --> 01:08:50.180
Follow them size fives.

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.100
Sloth.

01:08:55.769 --> 01:08:56.770
Chunk.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.231
Sloth.

01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:01.942
Chunk.

01:09:42.316 --> 01:09:46.153
Man, you smell like Phys. Ed.

01:09:47.654 --> 01:09:51.033
Mouth, hold this. Translate this.

01:09:52.326 --> 01:09:54.328
"Copper bones.

01:09:55.704 --> 01:09:57.664
Westward foams.

01:09:59.917 --> 01:10:01.084
Triple stones".

01:10:01.293 --> 01:10:03.170
This must be copper bones.

01:10:06.715 --> 01:10:08.091
Oh, sorry.

01:10:13.472 --> 01:10:15.891
Wow. Look at that.

01:10:17.184 --> 01:10:19.019
Triple stones!

01:10:19.478 --> 01:10:22.940
We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
We're right behind you.

01:10:23.148 --> 01:10:25.692
Why couldn't I have had a sister?

01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:28.570
A little sister instead
of that?

01:10:32.282 --> 01:10:34.743
No, that's too big.
Try the middle one.

01:10:34.952 --> 01:10:37.037
- You guys are crazy.
- No, the middle one!

01:10:37.663 --> 01:10:40.082
- It fits, Mikey! It fits!
- We got it!

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:42.960
- We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
- Which way do we turn?

01:10:43.168 --> 01:10:44.753
West. Counterclockwise.

01:10:44.962 --> 01:10:45.921
Counterclockwise.

01:10:46.171 --> 01:10:48.966
Try it, Mikey. Try it. Yeah, yeah!

01:10:54.513 --> 01:10:55.973
What the hell is that?

01:11:02.354 --> 01:11:04.064
It's gonna fall on us!

01:11:07.985 --> 01:11:10.320
It's one of Willy's tricks. Move!

01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:31.425
- He's gone.
- Oh, no.

01:11:31.633 --> 01:11:33.510
- Truly, truly gone.
- Don't be dead.

01:11:35.012 --> 01:11:39.182
Pinchers of Peril. You guys, I've
been saved by my Pinchers of Peril.

01:11:39.808 --> 01:11:42.728
He's alive! He's alive!

01:11:47.399 --> 01:11:50.861
You guys, I'm in another room!

01:11:51.236 --> 01:11:54.239
Hello, sheriff? I'm at
the Lighthouse Lounge...

01:11:54.406 --> 01:11:57.409
...and I want to report,
well, a murder.

01:11:57.618 --> 01:12:01.163
Wait a minute. Just hold on here.
Is that you again, Lawrence?

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.125
Sheriff, look, this time I'm telling
you the truth.

01:12:05.334 --> 01:12:09.129
I'm locked inside the Fratellis'
basement with this guy.

01:12:10.088 --> 01:12:12.466
Rocky Road?

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.053
Like the time 50 Iranian terrorists...

01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:18.639
...took over the Sizzler
steak houses?

01:12:18.847 --> 01:12:22.351
Sloth, get back here. Hold on.
Sloth, what are you doing?

01:12:22.601 --> 01:12:27.231
Like the prank about creatures that
multiply when you throw water on them?

01:12:27.648 --> 01:12:32.361
Sloth! Sloth!
Sloth's going into the fireplace!

01:12:34.238 --> 01:12:35.322
Lawrence?

01:12:36.073 --> 01:12:39.535
- No, Sloth, it's just your echo.
- Echo!

01:12:39.993 --> 01:12:42.454
No, I'll show you!
Don't go down there!

01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:45.249
It's all dark down there, Sloth.

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.960
It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.

01:12:52.172 --> 01:12:53.924
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.927
Pee break. Who's got to go?

01:12:57.302 --> 01:12:58.303
- Me.
- Me.

01:12:58.512 --> 01:12:59.930
- Me.
- Me.

01:13:00.472 --> 01:13:01.473
Me.

01:13:01.974 --> 01:13:06.311
This is the little boys' room and
that tunnel's the little girls' room.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.771
Let's go.

01:13:09.815 --> 01:13:11.608
Brand, where you going?

01:13:11.817 --> 01:13:13.402
This is the men's room.

01:13:16.697 --> 01:13:19.074
- Where you going?
- The men's room, Mikey.

01:13:19.283 --> 01:13:21.451
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:35.257
Yeah, Mikey's been through here
all right.

01:13:48.187 --> 01:13:50.647
Andy, this is not the time
nor the place.

01:13:50.856 --> 01:13:53.692
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

01:13:53.901 --> 01:13:55.903
Brand! Brand!

01:13:56.361 --> 01:13:58.655
Go see what she's ragging about,
will you?

01:14:12.377 --> 01:14:14.504
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here...

01:14:14.713 --> 01:14:17.299
...with my eyes closed.

01:14:41.365 --> 01:14:44.785
- Wrong way, lover-boy. It's this way.
- Thanks.

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:53.001
Okay, you kissed, now tell.

01:14:55.045 --> 01:14:56.713
There's something weird.

01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:58.632
What? What is it?

01:14:59.424 --> 01:15:01.093
Does Brand wear braces?

01:15:03.762 --> 01:15:05.722
Why are you laughing?

01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:08.892
Stef, it was beautiful.

01:15:10.435 --> 01:15:12.437
Next time, kiss him
with your eyes open.

01:15:12.646 --> 01:15:15.691
It's a whole different experience.

01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:18.110
Be careful. There's a hole, I think.

01:15:18.318 --> 01:15:20.320
I think Brand was standing in it.

01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:25.534
Ma, after we dump the kids, how do we
get out? I ain't left no trail.

01:15:25.742 --> 01:15:28.912
They're right around here.
I can smell their bubble gum.

01:15:29.121 --> 01:15:32.958
Ma, look. Give you three guesses
who left this rope.

01:15:33.584 --> 01:15:34.751
You all right?

01:15:52.144 --> 01:15:54.396
What, are you crazy? They're here!

01:15:54.938 --> 01:15:57.399
They're here? They're here.
They're here!

01:15:58.233 --> 01:16:01.111
Quiet. Right down there.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.114
This way. This way! This way!

01:16:04.323 --> 01:16:06.116
Come on, right through here!

01:16:06.325 --> 01:16:10.954
Let's go, follow me. Data, come on,
don't fall behind. Let's go!

01:16:16.835 --> 01:16:18.128
Come on!

01:16:18.795 --> 01:16:21.256
- Watch your step, Ma.
- Watch your own.

01:16:25.677 --> 01:16:26.678
Oh, God.

01:16:32.517 --> 01:16:33.852
- What is this?
- Keep going.

01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:36.855
- Oh, great.
- It looks like a boat mast.

01:16:40.526 --> 01:16:42.903
Jerk alert!

01:16:58.377 --> 01:17:00.170
Somebody's coming.

01:17:01.213 --> 01:17:02.256
You there, Ma?

01:17:02.464 --> 01:17:03.674
Hurry up.

01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:08.428
- Data, hurry up!
- Don't be a fool, Data, come on!

01:17:08.679 --> 01:17:13.433
- I got a great idea. Slick shoes!
- Slick shoes? Are you crazy?

01:17:19.815 --> 01:17:21.817
Data, come on!

01:17:22.317 --> 01:17:24.736
Good enough. I can see
their flashlight!

01:17:28.156 --> 01:17:34.079
Hi, fellas. Remember me?
We just want to get out of here.

01:17:39.626 --> 01:17:41.420
Stop or I'm gonna shoot!

01:17:47.634 --> 01:17:50.554
- You'll start a cave-in!
- What do you think that was?

01:17:50.721 --> 01:17:53.557
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:17:53.765 --> 01:17:56.560
Hurry up with that flare!
It's pitch-black!

01:18:00.355 --> 01:18:02.524
- Do you have a match?
- No.

01:18:02.733 --> 01:18:04.109
I'll light it on the lamp.

01:18:04.318 --> 01:18:05.944
- Cross now!
- Wait a minute!

01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:08.572
- Don't push, Jake!
- I'm not!

01:18:14.244 --> 01:18:16.330
Sweetheart, are you okay?

01:18:16.747 --> 01:18:18.582
No.

01:18:18.957 --> 01:18:22.961
These are all solid. Look at this.
All solid.

01:18:23.212 --> 01:18:24.922
What is that?

01:18:27.925 --> 01:18:28.926
It's disgusting.

01:18:34.681 --> 01:18:35.682
Wow.

01:18:36.475 --> 01:18:37.935
Gnarly.

01:18:38.185 --> 01:18:40.229
That's atrocious, you guys!

01:18:40.437 --> 01:18:42.981
Help him! Help him! Hurry up!

01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:51.532
What are you doing?

01:18:52.115 --> 01:18:55.827
Stop playing around! They're getting
away! What's the matter with you?

01:18:56.662 --> 01:19:00.415
"To move on, play the tune...

01:19:00.749 --> 01:19:02.834
...as each note is said.

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:07.297
If you make too many mistakes...

01:19:08.465 --> 01:19:12.219
...ye will surely be...

01:19:12.427 --> 01:19:13.929
- Be what?
...muerto".

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.723
- What is that? Come on.
- Dead.

01:19:16.932 --> 01:19:18.892
Oh, God!

01:19:21.478 --> 01:19:24.189
We gotta play the bones
to get out of here?

01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:25.941
Exactly.

01:19:26.608 --> 01:19:29.027
- They're on the bridge.
- Hurry up!

01:19:29.444 --> 01:19:34.449
- Look! There are notes on this.
- Andy, you took piano lessons.

01:19:34.658 --> 01:19:37.870
- I was 4 years old.
- You want to live to be 17?

01:19:38.078 --> 01:19:39.496
- Hit it!
- What're you doing!

01:19:39.663 --> 01:19:42.666
Finding middle C. This isn't
like my mother's Steinway.

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:44.960
Do something, hurry!

01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:48.797
This first chord, I think, is....

01:19:49.631 --> 01:19:50.841
Go on, Andy!

01:19:56.805 --> 01:19:59.057
My God, it's working!
You did it!

01:20:00.267 --> 01:20:04.062
- Way to go, Andy! Way to go!
- It's all coming back to me. Okay.

01:20:06.064 --> 01:20:07.107
A.

01:20:08.358 --> 01:20:12.112
- C sharp, D.
- Remember the lessons, play it right!

01:20:35.802 --> 01:20:40.224
They're coming, guys. They're
down there! They're coming out!

01:20:40.474 --> 01:20:43.185
- What should I do?
- All right!

01:20:47.898 --> 01:20:49.024
They're coming.

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:55.364
You guys, they look really pissed off!

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.334
- What were you thinking?
- I hit the wrong note.

01:21:07.543 --> 01:21:11.129
- I'm not Liberace, you know.
- Listen, you're doing fine.

01:21:11.338 --> 01:21:15.133
Andy, I believe in you.
Goonies always make mistakes.

01:21:15.342 --> 01:21:17.135
Don't make any more.

01:21:18.303 --> 01:21:19.763
Where was I?

01:21:20.222 --> 01:21:21.765
- A, A flat.
- Play it!

01:21:31.483 --> 01:21:34.069
Hey, you guys, they're gone!
They're not here!

01:21:57.551 --> 01:22:01.805
I can't tell if it's an A sharp
or a B flat.

01:22:02.598 --> 01:22:05.475
If you hit the wrong note,
we'll all be flat.

01:22:18.864 --> 01:22:19.740
Oh, my God!

01:22:25.412 --> 01:22:26.705
Go! Go!

01:22:27.289 --> 01:22:28.874
Oh, my God!

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:31.960
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

01:22:32.794 --> 01:22:34.046
Let's go!

01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:37.090
- Brand, wait!
- What?

01:22:37.758 --> 01:22:39.301
- What are you doing?
- The map!

01:22:39.551 --> 01:22:40.761
Let's get out of here!

01:22:42.095 --> 01:22:43.055
Damn it!

01:23:30.978 --> 01:23:34.147
Oh, shit!

01:23:35.691 --> 01:23:37.276
Geronimo!

01:23:45.492 --> 01:23:48.537
- Are you okay, Mouth? Andy?
- Are you okay, Stef.

01:23:48.787 --> 01:23:49.788
What?

01:23:51.248 --> 01:23:55.794
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow!

01:24:10.809 --> 01:24:12.102
Oh, my God!

01:24:13.687 --> 01:24:14.688
Oh, God!

01:24:15.022 --> 01:24:17.524
- Follow me.
- It's too....

01:24:19.193 --> 01:24:20.402
I can't do it, Mama.

01:24:25.741 --> 01:24:26.825
Idiot!

01:24:31.872 --> 01:24:33.332
Hold on, you guys.

01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:36.752
The water's really shallow.

01:24:44.301 --> 01:24:45.636
You okay, Data?

01:25:19.086 --> 01:25:21.213
You really think there's a treasure?

01:25:21.421 --> 01:25:23.465
Andy, this whole ship's a treasure.

01:25:25.509 --> 01:25:26.927
Mikey, look!

01:25:29.972 --> 01:25:31.431
Don't worry. It's just a skeleton.

01:25:37.604 --> 01:25:38.897
There's gotta be gold.

01:25:42.651 --> 01:25:44.361
Data. Data's okay.

01:25:51.493 --> 01:25:52.870
Data's okay.

01:25:53.078 --> 01:25:57.666
Data's quite tired of falling!
And Data's tired of skeletons!

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.961
- Why didn't you use the stairs?
- Use the stairs!

01:26:01.169 --> 01:26:02.170
Stairs!

01:26:02.921 --> 01:26:06.633
The stupid guys tell me to use
the stairs when Data's falling.

01:26:06.842 --> 01:26:10.387
- If Data's hurt, nobody cares anymore.
- Data's okay.

01:26:12.139 --> 01:26:15.142
Then some guy tells me
I have stupid inventions.

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:18.020
I've been spending
months and months...

01:26:18.228 --> 01:26:20.689
...studying on them
and inventing them. God!

01:26:25.485 --> 01:26:28.071
- Don't touch that.
- Why not? He's dead.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.949
- Have some respect.
- Put that down.

01:26:31.158 --> 01:26:32.951
How many ships were there?

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.788
- Billions.
- Billions? Billions?!

01:26:37.748 --> 01:26:40.918
Watch where you step, all right?
Don't slip. Don't...

01:26:48.508 --> 01:26:50.552
Mouth, translate.

01:26:50.761 --> 01:26:54.806
Translate nothing. It's a sketch
of the cannonball chamber.

01:26:55.015 --> 01:26:56.016
Where's the gold?!

01:26:56.225 --> 01:26:59.728
Where's the gold, Mikey?!
I'm tired of these games!

01:27:05.025 --> 01:27:06.568
I set off another trap.

01:27:09.947 --> 01:27:13.742
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Are you guys okay?

01:27:14.493 --> 01:27:15.327
Oh, my God!

01:27:15.661 --> 01:27:16.662
It's Willy.

01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:20.082
Break through.

01:27:38.267 --> 01:27:40.978
- What's up there?
- It's all right, Brand.

01:27:41.186 --> 01:27:43.272
- Just give me a second.
- Okay.

01:28:17.431 --> 01:28:19.933
I know how these guys must've died.

01:28:28.483 --> 01:28:31.570
It's Willy. One-Eyed Willy.

01:28:41.496 --> 01:28:42.581
Hi, Willy.

01:28:44.666 --> 01:28:48.670
I'm Mike Walsh.
You've been expecting me...

01:28:49.504 --> 01:28:50.756
...haven't you?

01:28:51.882 --> 01:28:53.592
I made it. I beat you.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.262
I got here in one piece so far.

01:29:08.482 --> 01:29:12.277
That's why they call you
One-Eyed Willy, One-Eyed Willy.

01:29:15.239 --> 01:29:17.824
We have a lot in common, huh, Willy?

01:29:20.494 --> 01:29:22.204
You know something, Willy?

01:29:23.163 --> 01:29:24.831
You're the first Goonie.

01:29:34.883 --> 01:29:35.884
Hi, guys.

01:29:37.219 --> 01:29:40.389
How's it going? This is Willy.

01:29:40.889 --> 01:29:42.349
One-Eyed Willy.

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.351
Say hi, Willy.

01:29:46.103 --> 01:29:49.314
Those are my friends, the Goonies.

01:29:51.525 --> 01:29:53.151
How long have you been there?

01:29:53.902 --> 01:29:56.655
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.

01:30:19.344 --> 01:30:21.805
What are you staring at?
Let's go, load up!

01:30:22.014 --> 01:30:24.016
Anything that fits in your pockets.

01:30:24.224 --> 01:30:25.559
Except that.

01:30:26.059 --> 01:30:28.770
- Why?
- That's Willy's.

01:30:30.105 --> 01:30:32.232
Save that for Willy. Anything else.

01:30:41.408 --> 01:30:43.202
Bye-bye, marbles.

01:30:44.077 --> 01:30:46.413
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:30:46.705 --> 01:30:49.082
Hurry up! Those creeps are
still after us.

01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:53.212
- That's right! What will we do?
- I don't know. Who cares?

01:30:54.379 --> 01:30:56.381
- I got an idea.
- What is it?

01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.091
I saw it on The Hardy Boys.

01:30:58.717 --> 01:31:01.386
We leave a trail of jewels
into one cave...

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.096
...and we hide in another.

01:31:03.722 --> 01:31:06.767
When the Fratellis go into that cave,
we make a run for it.

01:31:06.975 --> 01:31:09.228
Now that sounds like a great idea!

01:31:10.604 --> 01:31:13.732
- Outside!
- Okay, this is war!

01:31:13.941 --> 01:31:15.984
- Data, don't do anything!
- No!

01:31:16.193 --> 01:31:17.444
I said, outside!

01:31:17.653 --> 01:31:21.114
- We won't be taken alive, matey!
- What do you mean "we"?

01:31:21.323 --> 01:31:22.491
Get Data!

01:31:22.699 --> 01:31:24.952
It's not funny! She's got a gun!

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:26.620
Come on, snap to.

01:31:26.828 --> 01:31:29.289
- Oh, I love that.
- Come on!

01:31:35.128 --> 01:31:37.005
Sneaking up on me, huh?

01:31:38.715 --> 01:31:40.968
I know what I'm doing.

01:31:51.812 --> 01:31:52.771
I'm all right.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.065
Data's just unhappy.

01:31:56.608 --> 01:31:57.985
Pinchers of Power.

01:31:58.151 --> 01:32:01.613
- Get it off me!
- Let me help you, brother.

01:32:07.244 --> 01:32:08.620
- My gun!
- That's it!

01:32:08.829 --> 01:32:12.457
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Let's go!

01:32:19.923 --> 01:32:21.300
Empty your pockets!

01:32:21.508 --> 01:32:24.428
Hurry up, empty your jewels! Come on!

01:32:30.559 --> 01:32:34.313
You're so quiet all of a sudden.
Aren't you called Mouth?

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.155
Oh, my God.

01:32:45.407 --> 01:32:46.867
Is that all?

01:32:49.745 --> 01:32:52.456
Oh, my God.

01:32:55.209 --> 01:32:56.501
You gross old witch.

01:32:58.754 --> 01:33:03.091
You want to play pirate?
We'll play pirate. March!

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.678
- Keep going, smarty.
- I can't swim with my hands tied.

01:33:06.887 --> 01:33:09.056
We'll play pirates. Walk the plank!

01:33:09.264 --> 01:33:11.016
Get out on that plank.

01:33:11.225 --> 01:33:14.853
- Say goodbye to your little friends.
- Brand!

01:33:20.234 --> 01:33:21.360
Get out of the way.

01:33:24.947 --> 01:33:26.156
Who's next?

01:33:33.247 --> 01:33:35.582
Ow, will you stop pushing me?!

01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:39.545
- You're pulling my hair!
- You get that girl away from me.

01:33:39.878 --> 01:33:41.838
Go join your friends, you weasels.

01:33:42.047 --> 01:33:43.882
Hey, you guys!

01:33:50.806 --> 01:33:52.933
Sloth! How'd he get out?

01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:56.436
Sloth, save them!
Save them, it's Mouth and Stef!

01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:11.743
- Chunk.
- No, it's Captain Chunk.

01:34:12.119 --> 01:34:13.412
Give me the sword.

01:34:14.663 --> 01:34:18.417
Captain Chunk says let's get the hell
out of here!

01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:39.855
The rope.

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:44.484
Jump rope, Slothy.

01:34:44.693 --> 01:34:48.030
- What do you mean, "jump rope"?
- You know, jump rope.

01:35:11.178 --> 01:35:12.513
We're in deep shit now.

01:35:12.721 --> 01:35:14.264
Oh, shit.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.312
- Remember we went to the Bronx Zoo?
- Don't start that.

01:35:20.521 --> 01:35:24.483
- They wanted to leave you. I said no.
- We never been to the Bronx Zoo!

01:35:24.691 --> 01:35:29.821
Remember how they bought Francis a
toupee instead of fixing your teeth?

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:33.992
- I don't wear a hairpiece!
- You rotten bastard!

01:35:45.712 --> 01:35:48.298
Here, grab on to the rock. Come on.

01:36:06.275 --> 01:36:09.528
- What happened to your braces?
- I don't wear braces.

01:36:11.864 --> 01:36:13.824
Mikey, that little...

01:36:14.783 --> 01:36:16.410
Heave-ho!

01:36:20.372 --> 01:36:22.916
- I won't sing no more.
- Just put us down safely!

01:36:23.125 --> 01:36:24.459
I won't sing anymore.

01:36:24.877 --> 01:36:27.629
Hey, you guys!

01:36:31.717 --> 01:36:33.343
Mama.

01:36:34.136 --> 01:36:36.180
Come to Mama, baby. Come on.

01:36:41.685 --> 01:36:42.728
Ma...

01:36:42.936 --> 01:36:45.397
...you've been bad.

01:36:47.274 --> 01:36:49.526
Slothy, I may have been bad.

01:36:49.735 --> 01:36:54.156
I may have kept you chained in
that room. But it was for your good.

01:36:57.326 --> 01:36:59.536
Aw. I used to sing to you.

01:37:02.873 --> 01:37:04.541
When you were a little boy.

01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:18.013
Fall!

01:37:19.598 --> 01:37:20.724
Break!

01:37:21.475 --> 01:37:22.518
Fall!

01:37:23.101 --> 01:37:24.436
I only dropped you once.

01:37:25.771 --> 01:37:27.356
Well, maybe twice.

01:37:30.442 --> 01:37:31.777
Put me down.

01:37:40.202 --> 01:37:42.120
- I don't mind dying.
- Calm down.

01:37:42.329 --> 01:37:43.580
- We'll be okay.
- Sure.

01:37:50.546 --> 01:37:54.341
I gotta rot with you through eternity?
I don't want to rot with you!

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:04.226
Sloth, this is the guys.
Guys, this is Sloth.

01:38:05.686 --> 01:38:10.357
Brand, we can't go. We can't leave
all that gold. That's our future.

01:38:10.566 --> 01:38:14.528
If we stay here, we got no future.
We'll come back for it later.

01:38:14.736 --> 01:38:16.822
- All that rich stuff.
- Come on!

01:38:18.198 --> 01:38:19.825
Mama, just let us down easy.

01:38:21.994 --> 01:38:24.288
Not the sword!
Don't do that, we're gonna...

01:38:29.751 --> 01:38:31.086
- You all right?
- Yeah. You?

01:38:31.295 --> 01:38:32.337
Yeah.

01:38:34.089 --> 01:38:35.674
Will you get up?!

01:38:37.217 --> 01:38:38.635
Let's go find the gold.

01:38:39.845 --> 01:38:41.013
Head for the light.

01:38:48.812 --> 01:38:50.898
Thank you, Mr. Willy.

01:38:51.273 --> 01:38:52.733
Thank you.

01:38:53.192 --> 01:38:54.818
You've made my day.

01:38:55.777 --> 01:38:58.322
This is a real treat.

01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:04.578
What the hell is this?

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.789
- Another one of those booby traps!
- Booby trap!

01:39:08.749 --> 01:39:09.750
Get out of here!

01:39:09.958 --> 01:39:11.627
What booby traps?

01:39:11.877 --> 01:39:14.254
Booby traps!
Didn't you see the movie?

01:39:14.463 --> 01:39:16.256
Leave it. Let's get out.

01:39:16.548 --> 01:39:18.175
Look, you guys, daylight.

01:39:18.383 --> 01:39:21.470
There's been a cave-in before.
Maybe we can get through.

01:39:21.678 --> 01:39:23.180
I can't see. Got a light?

01:39:23.388 --> 01:39:25.766
I got the last candle. Mikey, get it.

01:39:26.934 --> 01:39:28.769
Is there a way out or what?

01:39:29.228 --> 01:39:31.438
This is a funny candle. It sparkles.

01:39:31.647 --> 01:39:33.982
- It's not a candle, it's dynamite!
- Dynamite!

01:39:59.758 --> 01:40:01.927
Women and children first!

01:40:02.469 --> 01:40:05.013
- You guys, push.
- Push.

01:40:05.222 --> 01:40:06.723
What about the loot?

01:40:06.932 --> 01:40:08.684
What about our lives?

01:40:19.778 --> 01:40:21.738
Can you do it? Come on, hurry.

01:40:23.031 --> 01:40:24.324
Go!

01:40:27.286 --> 01:40:28.412
Hurry up.

01:40:31.415 --> 01:40:33.584
Sloth! Help us!

01:40:43.177 --> 01:40:45.262
Sloth love Chunk!

01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:48.015
I love you too. You'll get crushed.

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:51.685
Sloth, help!

01:40:55.898 --> 01:40:57.816
Come on, Sloth!

01:41:35.729 --> 01:41:38.524
Well, I'll be damned.
It's them goobers.

01:41:39.066 --> 01:41:40.817
They weren't here a minute ago.

01:41:41.026 --> 01:41:44.112
- But they're here now. Call Harvey.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:44.321 --> 01:41:46.490
- Here!
- Over here!

01:41:55.374 --> 01:41:56.667
Get the camera.

01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:03.924
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

01:42:04.466 --> 01:42:06.468
I guess we're kind of in deep sh...

01:42:10.806 --> 01:42:12.724
Look, you're a mess.

01:42:22.818 --> 01:42:25.863
- Look what we brought you.
- Oh, pizza!

01:42:26.071 --> 01:42:29.116
- Your favorite.
- Everything's on it.

01:42:29.324 --> 01:42:32.744
- We were in the tunnels.
- It's good to hear your voice.

01:42:32.953 --> 01:42:34.705
- I lost my glasses.
- It's okay.

01:42:34.913 --> 01:42:36.206
Can I take piano lessons?

01:42:36.415 --> 01:42:38.709
- You'll get ammonia.
- It's pneumonia, Ma.

01:42:38.917 --> 01:42:40.794
Get these pants off.

01:42:42.379 --> 01:42:43.881
Hold it right there.

01:42:47.092 --> 01:42:48.218
That's great, Dad.

01:42:48.427 --> 01:42:50.137
Just watch this.

01:42:57.102 --> 01:42:58.061
He's just like his dad.

01:43:08.947 --> 01:43:11.909
I just wanted to say thank you...

01:43:12.117 --> 01:43:14.536
...for offering to save
my life and everything.

01:43:14.745 --> 01:43:17.915
- What, what, what?
- I wanted to say thank you.

01:43:18.123 --> 01:43:20.959
Wow. "Thank you". A real moment.

01:43:21.168 --> 01:43:24.796
Your voice is kind of nice when
your mouth isn't screwing it up.

01:43:25.005 --> 01:43:26.423
Yeah, well, thanks.

01:43:26.632 --> 01:43:29.927
And you know, your looks
are kind of pretty...

01:43:30.844 --> 01:43:33.096
...when your face doesn't screw it up.

01:43:33.305 --> 01:43:34.389
I'm just kidding.

01:43:36.475 --> 01:43:37.809
Hey, Mikey.

01:43:39.978 --> 01:43:43.273
You know, you're a great
little kid... Person.

01:43:43.857 --> 01:43:46.401
You keep kissing girls
the way you do...

01:43:46.610 --> 01:43:48.695
...the parts of you
that don't work so good...

01:43:48.904 --> 01:43:51.323
...they'll catch up
to the ones that do.

01:44:04.086 --> 01:44:05.963
- What?
- Let her mother worry.

01:44:11.051 --> 01:44:12.594
Oh, who needs it?

01:44:14.012 --> 01:44:14.721
It's the Fratellis!

01:44:16.014 --> 01:44:18.809
- Thank God you're here.
- We need your help.

01:44:22.479 --> 01:44:24.606
You're all under arrest. Let's go.

01:44:27.067 --> 01:44:28.068
Don't shoot him!

01:44:29.444 --> 01:44:33.156
- Look out, kid.
- No! Don't shoot him!

01:44:33.365 --> 01:44:37.035
Get them out of here.
You don't know what you're doing.

01:44:37.578 --> 01:44:39.121
These are the bad guys!

01:44:39.329 --> 01:44:40.998
Those are the bad guys!

01:44:42.249 --> 01:44:45.335
Put him down, Sloth.
Put him down. It'll be all right.

01:44:49.506 --> 01:44:50.591
Come on, Mama.

01:44:50.799 --> 01:44:54.094
You have no idea who I am.
You want to lose your job?

01:45:00.559 --> 01:45:02.728
You're gonna live with me now.

01:45:04.521 --> 01:45:06.607
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:45:08.567 --> 01:45:10.235
Because I love you.

01:45:11.069 --> 01:45:14.656
- I love you, Chunk.
- Oh, I love you, Sloth.

01:45:17.034 --> 01:45:19.244
Walsh, today's the day,
so let's get this over with.

01:45:20.204 --> 01:45:21.371
Irving?

01:45:21.914 --> 01:45:25.000
- I'm sorry, Irene.
- Come on, we don't have all day.

01:45:25.542 --> 01:45:28.003
There's 50 houses
to tear down after yours!

01:45:28.545 --> 01:45:30.380
- Ease off, Brand.
- Punk!

01:45:32.007 --> 01:45:34.009
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.470
Sorry, Dad.

01:45:36.887 --> 01:45:39.097
We had our hands on the future.

01:45:39.306 --> 01:45:42.059
But we blew it to save our own lives.

01:45:42.226 --> 01:45:43.477
Sorry.

01:45:44.394 --> 01:45:47.940
That's all right. You and Brand
are safe with your mom and me.

01:45:48.732 --> 01:45:51.735
That makes us
the richest people in Astoria.

01:45:55.697 --> 01:45:59.451
You're looking at the richest people
in Astoria. Now sign it.

01:46:09.419 --> 01:46:11.755
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.

01:46:23.225 --> 01:46:24.852
What's she saying, Mouth?

01:46:28.897 --> 01:46:30.649
- No pen.
- No pen?

01:46:30.858 --> 01:46:32.276
No write.

01:46:34.069 --> 01:46:35.445
No sign!

01:46:36.321 --> 01:46:37.865
Don't sign!

01:46:43.912 --> 01:46:46.248
- What's in the bag?
- What is it?

01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:00.637
Dad! It's my marble bag!
The Fratellis forgot to check it.

01:47:00.804 --> 01:47:05.434
I put the jewels in it.
We don't have to leave the Goon Docks!

01:47:05.642 --> 01:47:10.647
There'll be no more signing today
or ever again!

01:47:13.483 --> 01:47:15.861
Are those jewels real?
How'd you find them?

01:47:16.069 --> 01:47:17.613
Were your lives in danger?

01:47:17.821 --> 01:47:20.449
- The octopus was scary.
- Octopus?

01:47:20.657 --> 01:47:23.452
- It was dangerous.
- Walking the plank was scariest.

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:24.786
Walking the plank?

01:47:24.995 --> 01:47:28.540
- Then we found the pirate ship.
- That and the pirate's treasure.

01:47:28.749 --> 01:47:31.585
- We were chased by the Fratellis.
- That's enough.

01:47:31.793 --> 01:47:35.172
- Telling more stories, Lawrence?
- No, this time it's for real.

01:47:35.339 --> 01:47:37.299
How do you think we got the gold?

01:47:38.425 --> 01:47:41.011
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:47:41.678 --> 01:47:43.847
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

01:47:53.315 --> 01:47:55.317
Folks, we're at Cauldron Point...

01:47:55.526 --> 01:47:58.487
...and what appears
to be a pirate ship....

01:48:18.048 --> 01:48:19.383
Bye, Willy.

01:48:20.926 --> 01:48:22.135
Thanks.
