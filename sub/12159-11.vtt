IN CHRISTMAS TREES.

I'M GONNA GO
MAKE SOME DECORATIONS.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.030
GOOD IDEA.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.364
IT'S KIND OF
A SMALL TREE,

00:32.366 --> 00:33.899
BUT IT JUST MAKES THE PRESENTS
YOU PUT UNDER IT LOOK BIGGER.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.068
IT'S A TRICK YOUR MOM AND I USED
DURING THE LEAN YEARS.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.636

OKAY?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.671

TO "SPEECHLESS"?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.769
YOUR MOM AND I
REALLY WOULD LIKE YOU

01:10.771 --> 01:12.738
TO HAVE THE WEDDING
AT ST. MARK'S.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.541

A DIFFERENT VENUE IN MIND.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.544

TO GET MARRIED IN ESTES PARK,

UNDER A TREE
IN THE FOREST.

ALREADY HAS THAT VENUE BOOKED.

IN MULTICULTURAL CEREMONIES.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.923
THERE'S GONNA BE CHANTING
AND DRUMS AND DIDGERIDOOS.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.925
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
20 GRAND, THOUGH.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.527
SOUNDS LIKE...
ABOUT 8 BUCKS

01:35.529 --> 01:37.529
AND THE LONGEST AFTERNOON
OF MY LIFE.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.198
SO, LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.400
YOU'RE TRYING TO
BRIBE US WITH A CHECK

01:41.402 --> 01:42.734
TO DO A CHURCH WEDDING?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.470
IS THAT
WHAT JESUS WOULD DO?

01:44.472 --> 01:47.072
JESUS DIDN'T HAVE
A CHECKING ACCOUNT.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.475
BUT HE WASN'T AGAINST
HANDING OUT LOAVES AND FISH

01:49.477 --> 01:51.810

IN THE SEATS.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.745

A VERY GENEROUS OFFER,

03:43.924 --> 03:45.991
LAST YEAR
WAS THE NON-TINSEL YEAR.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.094
I REMEMBER BECAUSE
THERE WAS NO TINSEL ON THE TREE.
