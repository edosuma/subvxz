01:01.195 --> 01:03.797
Nuclear war could quite possibly

01:03.897 --> 01:06.367
finish off
civilization altogether.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.146
Climate change
left to run its own course

01:18.246 --> 01:21.315
could also finish us off.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.488
The existential issue

01:27.588 --> 01:31.792
is whether we can foresee
what needs to be done

01:31.892 --> 01:34.228
and get it done
in time to matter.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.002
We are always in a race

01:42.170 --> 01:45.639
between what our intelligence
can do for us

01:47.475 --> 01:50.644
and what our intelligence
does to us.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.454
Drought and food shortage...

02:00.554 --> 02:02.656
A just-released report
from the Pentagon...

02:02.756 --> 02:06.194
climate change and the challenges
it's creating for the military.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.828
The latest report says
global warming

02:07.928 --> 02:10.631
is driving weather
to new levels of extremes.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.267
A growing threat
to national security.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.742
The predicted consequences
of a warming world

02:21.842 --> 02:23.511
are already with us.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.446
Climate change
and natural disasters

02:25.546 --> 02:29.283
can cause humanitarian crises,
population migrations.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.487
Scarcity of water, food,
and space

02:33.587 --> 02:36.657
could lead to failed states,
instability,

02:36.757 --> 02:39.427
and potentially radicalization.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.296
Senator, there's no question
that environmental security

02:42.396 --> 02:45.866
can have a dramatic affect
on overall security

02:45.966 --> 02:48.068
both in individual states
and regionally.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.672
Never before have so many people
fled war and persecution.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.543
This is climate change
far beyond the melting ice caps.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.786
Global climate change,
while not new to history,

03:05.886 --> 03:08.256
is new to the modern world.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.827
It can significantly
add to the challenges

03:13.927 --> 03:15.263
of global instability:

03:15.296 --> 03:17.765
Hunger, poverty, and conflict.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.968
The effects of climate change

03:21.068 --> 03:24.104
are far-reaching
and unpredictable,

03:24.272 --> 03:27.508
demanding our attention
and strategic thinking.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.278
The U.S. department of defense

03:30.311 --> 03:34.348
is preparing to adapt to these
21st century challenges.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.663
The intersection
of climate change

03:49.763 --> 03:51.299
and the security of nations

03:51.365 --> 03:55.836
will become a defining reality
in the years ahead.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.307
We cannot ignore the costs
of inaction

03:59.373 --> 04:03.311
and we cannot leave these
massive security concerns

04:03.377 --> 04:07.315
to the next generation.

04:07.381 --> 04:11.519
We are now in the age
of consequences.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.568
Think about it from
a military perspective.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.870
When I was leading
paratroopers in Afghanistan,

04:29.970 --> 04:32.606
if 98, 99% of my intelligence

04:32.706 --> 04:35.909
told me that I was driving
my platoon down a road

04:36.009 --> 04:38.178
and that two miles
down that road

04:38.346 --> 04:39.112
there's an ambush
waiting for me.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.916
I don't get to say,
"yeah, but there's that 1%"

04:43.016 --> 04:44.352
that says
that there's no ambush,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.053
so to hell with the other 99%.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.221
"We're gonna
keep going down the road."

04:48.356 --> 04:52.626
I mean, that's negligence
on an unfathomable scale.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.227
That's the debate
we're having right now

04:54.428 --> 04:55.228
with regard to climate.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.230
The overwhelming consensus

04:57.365 --> 05:00.368
is we are facing a massive risk.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.370
Climate change is happening.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.238
We've got to decide whether
we're going to act on it or not.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.608
And that choice
has consequences.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.583
Climate change impacts
the basic resources

05:15.683 --> 05:19.387
that are necessary
for humans to survive

05:19.453 --> 05:24.091
and for nations to continue.

05:24.191 --> 05:28.261
As we see our resources
stressed significantly,

05:28.396 --> 05:30.464
we're gonna see some
unprecedented changes

05:30.564 --> 05:32.833
that we have to prepare for.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.268
The risks of climate change

05:35.403 --> 05:38.071
impact on every facet of life.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.409
They impact on every facet
of national security

05:41.475 --> 05:43.911
and of international security.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.480
That makes instability.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.884
That makes conflict
much more likely.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.525
The first time I thought about
climate change and violence

05:57.625 --> 06:00.428
was in Afghanistan
while researching opium Poppy

06:00.494 --> 06:03.664
from which heroin is made.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.566
Every time
I interviewed farmers,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.435
they said, "part of why
we grow this crop"

06:07.501 --> 06:09.670
is because
it's drought-resistant."

06:09.770 --> 06:11.304
Turns out Afghanistan

06:11.439 --> 06:13.040
is going through the worst
drought in living memory,

06:13.140 --> 06:16.844
and Poppy uses one fifth
the amount of water

06:16.944 --> 06:19.547
that wheat uses.

06:19.647 --> 06:23.551
The Karzai government
were eradicating Poppy.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.986
The Taliban, on the other hand,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.521
said to the farmers,

06:27.621 --> 06:31.525
"we will defend your right
to grow this crop."

06:31.625 --> 06:34.862
Even in that conflict which
has this elaborate history,

06:34.962 --> 06:38.131
there is a climate aspect.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.568
It's always a question
of how climate change

06:40.668 --> 06:43.771
interacts with other
pre-existing problems.

06:49.810 --> 06:54.081
If you have an area
that is already unstable

06:54.181 --> 06:58.018
and then has the additional
challenge of sea level rise,

06:58.118 --> 06:59.587
extreme weather events,

06:59.687 --> 07:01.789
water shortages
or food shortages

07:01.889 --> 07:04.892
or a disaster
that makes people move,

07:04.992 --> 07:07.895
then you can start seeing
conflict situations.

07:10.698 --> 07:13.100
It's all
the underlying conditions.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.636
Climate change is the stimulus
or the catalyst

07:15.736 --> 07:19.740
that can cause all of that
to agitate and become conflict.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.862
From my perspective
as a former member

07:41.962 --> 07:43.230
of the United States military

07:43.330 --> 07:45.533
and 30 plus years
of service in uniform,

07:45.599 --> 07:50.203
climate change is what we call
an accelerant to instability.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.006
It is what's causing
a lot of the conflict

07:53.106 --> 07:55.108
or helping assist the conflict

07:55.208 --> 07:56.610
that's going on
around the world.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.379
And you can see that
on the front pages

07:59.547 --> 08:01.549
of the paper
virtually every day.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.251
If you look
around the world today,

08:39.352 --> 08:41.589
we can already see
conflict and climate in play

08:41.621 --> 08:43.857
right under the headlines
that we're reading.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.593
The international red cross

08:45.626 --> 08:48.195
is now designating
Syria's deadly conflict

08:48.295 --> 08:50.898
to be a full-blown civil war.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.467
Think about relationships
we don't often look at.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.136
The civil war in Syria,

08:56.236 --> 08:58.138
now going on for years,

08:58.238 --> 09:00.641
hundreds of thousands dead,

09:00.741 --> 09:03.611
the entire region
is in chaos as a result.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.220
A new study finds
climate change exacerbated

09:13.320 --> 09:15.288
the worst drought ever
in modern Syria

09:15.388 --> 09:19.092
as a consequence
of human interference.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.628
Professor Richard Seager

09:20.694 --> 09:22.262
says that a three-year drought

09:22.362 --> 09:24.865
played a huge role
in pushing the Syrian people

09:24.965 --> 09:26.767
into an all-out civil war.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.871
This is the first study
that quantitatively

09:30.971 --> 09:34.141
draws a connection
between climate change

09:34.241 --> 09:38.011
and the onset of a conflict.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.648
Syria began to experience

09:40.714 --> 09:42.515
a serious multi-year drought

09:42.650 --> 09:44.852
in the winter of 2006, 2007.

09:44.952 --> 09:49.757
And that drought lasted
for three consecutive years.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.060
Farming families just
cannot survive on the land

09:53.160 --> 09:55.763
when a drought lasts that long.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.565
As people try to feed
their families and can't,

09:58.666 --> 10:00.868
they've got to go somewhere.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.103
The drought caused
a large number

10:03.203 --> 10:04.772
of young Syrian
men in particular

10:04.872 --> 10:07.274
to leave farmland
and go to the cities.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.076
Damascus, Aleppo,

10:09.176 --> 10:12.045
one and a half plus
million people had to move.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.215
That has a major
destabilizing impact

10:15.315 --> 10:16.950
when people have
to pick up and leave

10:17.050 --> 10:19.953
whether it's because of conflict
or resource scarcity.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.521
As anyone can tell you,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.390
a bunch of unemployed
young men in a major city

10:23.490 --> 10:25.826
is not a recipe
for social stability.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.703
Now Syria had already absorbed

10:35.803 --> 10:37.738
about a million
and a half refugees

10:37.838 --> 10:41.274
from Iraq who were fleeing
the civil war there.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.976
Those numbers combined such

10:43.076 --> 10:45.278
that the population
of Syrian cities

10:45.378 --> 10:49.016
grew by about 30% or more.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.185
That rate of migration
is absolutely catastrophic.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.321
It drove food prices up,

10:54.421 --> 10:56.323
it drove apartment prices up,

10:56.423 --> 10:57.858
strained the health system,

10:57.958 --> 11:01.461
all leading to the kinds
of conditions of discontent

11:01.729 --> 11:03.630
to the all-out civil war

11:03.731 --> 11:06.433
that is still going on now.

11:06.533 --> 11:10.738
When we analyzed all the
precipitation data we could get,

11:10.838 --> 11:13.106
we found that we just
couldn't attribute

11:13.206 --> 11:15.575
such a long and serious drought

11:15.743 --> 11:18.278
to natural climate
variability alone.

11:18.378 --> 11:22.282
That particular drought was
two to three times more likely

11:22.382 --> 11:26.253
because of climate change.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.121
We of course did not say

11:28.221 --> 11:32.860
drought was the sole cause
of the Syrian civil war.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.430
It's the confluence
of multiple causes coming in,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.833
with climate being one of them.

11:43.771 --> 11:46.106
Climate change
is all about the water.

11:46.206 --> 11:51.078
So we have climate change
leading to rainfall variability.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.915
We don't necessarily know
when the water is gonna come.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.917
We can't predict
that we're gonna get

11:57.017 --> 11:59.787
the same amount of water
as we used to get,

11:59.853 --> 12:02.422
and that is going to have
a huge impact

12:02.522 --> 12:06.393
on whether or not
we can grow food.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.628
So in the case of Syria,

12:08.796 --> 12:10.263
we're talking about
how climate change

12:10.363 --> 12:12.132
impacts water resources,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.034
how that impacts food resources,

12:14.134 --> 12:16.870
and what that means
for what people do for a living,

12:16.970 --> 12:20.507
whether it's farm, herd animals,

12:20.607 --> 12:23.310
or join a terrorist
organization.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.282
This is a city draped in black

12:29.382 --> 12:32.652
and a city raging with anger.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.987
This is Isis,

12:34.087 --> 12:36.256
the Islamic state
of Iraq and Syria.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.691
As people moved
into those cities in Syria,

12:38.826 --> 12:40.994
they were unemployed,
didn't have a source of food.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
They needed
to feed their families.

12:43.196 --> 12:46.299
ISIL promised them
both those things

12:46.399 --> 12:49.302
despite the philosophy
behind their organizations,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.939
people want to survive first.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.207
Isis was pre-existing
in the region

12:54.307 --> 12:58.278
and would have existed even there
had not been a drought in Syria,

12:58.378 --> 13:02.850
but once the Syrian society
began to unravel,

13:02.916 --> 13:05.152
every actor within that region

13:05.252 --> 13:08.488
saw an opportunity
to try to use the crisis

13:08.588 --> 13:12.525
to advance
their pre-existing agenda.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.962
Isis has certainly
taken advantage

13:15.062 --> 13:16.729
of scarce water resources,

13:16.864 --> 13:18.866
creating leverage
over local populations.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.868
Isis has just taken over a dam

13:20.901 --> 13:21.969
near the key city of Ramadi,

13:22.069 --> 13:23.403
shutting it down
and preventing water

13:23.503 --> 13:25.105
from reaching two key towns.

13:25.205 --> 13:30.077
Their goal, to quote
"kill people of thirst."

13:30.177 --> 13:32.880
They're securing access
to river towns.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.481
They're securing access
to water supplies,

13:34.581 --> 13:36.183
and it's driving their strategy.

13:36.283 --> 13:39.286
Water becomes
an instrument of war

13:39.386 --> 13:42.522
for these people
who are looking to take over.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.024
You control the water,

13:44.124 --> 13:46.293
you control the livelihood
of the people.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.531
Climate change is gonna impact
the amount of water.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.967
It'll impact
who controls the water.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.969
That'll impact the instability.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.939
The climate change that
we're gonna be experiencing

13:59.039 --> 14:01.574
over the next few years
is way in excess

14:01.674 --> 14:04.011
of what we've experienced
up to now.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.014
And I think the Syria case
is a real wake-up

14:07.114 --> 14:09.016
for what
the consequences can be,

14:09.116 --> 14:11.919
and this is really early on
in this game.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.021
It's in the U.S.
national interest

14:14.121 --> 14:16.924
to ensure that there's
a stability globally.

14:17.024 --> 14:20.127
Those are things
that can come home to us.

14:47.955 --> 14:48.956
You can always look at Syria

14:48.989 --> 14:50.357
and say, "well, it's Isis,"

14:50.457 --> 14:51.491
or, "well, it's Assad."

14:51.591 --> 14:53.426
Yes, it is Isis.
Yes, it's Assad.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.463
But there's a backdrop
which has to do with climate.

14:58.966 --> 15:03.270
That's gonna happen
over and over and over again.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.006
Each time we'll have a different
political or ideological story to tell,

15:06.106 --> 15:07.440
each time it'll be true,

15:07.540 --> 15:10.677
and each time the underlying
factor will be climate.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.524
When you talk about
climate change,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.426
it's a national
security challenge

15:26.526 --> 15:27.995
in the broadest possible sense,

15:28.095 --> 15:31.098
in that these changing
weather patterns over time

15:31.198 --> 15:33.666
are going to affect
the way we live.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.268
They're going to affect
our food supply,

15:35.368 --> 15:39.039
our water supply, the heat
of the environment we live in.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.409
Security in the broadest sense

15:42.509 --> 15:45.112
is about all the things
that we care about day to day.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.048
Are you safe?
Can you feed your family?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.517
Can your children go to school?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.252
When you talk about
climate change

15:52.352 --> 15:55.588
as a national security challenge
in the military sense,

15:55.688 --> 15:57.657
you're talking about
how does it affect

15:57.757 --> 15:59.659
what the military has to do?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.495
The missions it goes on,

16:02.595 --> 16:05.332
or support here at home.

16:05.432 --> 16:09.102
How does it affect what they need
to be ready for in the future?

16:12.039 --> 16:15.042
We all know
that human activities

16:15.108 --> 16:17.377
are changing the atmosphere

16:17.477 --> 16:22.049
in unexpected
and in unprecedented ways.

16:26.519 --> 16:31.358
I first saw the effects on national
security and national defense

16:32.059 --> 16:36.663
in Somalia in the early '90s.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.632
The essential nature
of that conflict

16:39.732 --> 16:42.702
was originally caused by drought

16:42.802 --> 16:46.973
and a lack of food,
simply stated,

16:47.074 --> 16:50.077
and we began to see
a major trend.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.912
Climate change
is one of the variables

16:53.080 --> 16:54.281
that must be considered

16:54.381 --> 16:57.384
when thinking about
instability in the world.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.489
I'd like to turn now
to Sherri Goodman.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.924
She served as deputy
undersecretary of defense

17:05.092 --> 17:06.259
for environmental security.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.261
Like many of you probably now,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.430
you want to work on
the big issues of the day.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.931
That's what I wanted to do,

17:12.098 --> 17:14.101
so I was in the field
of national security.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.737
Nuclear weapons and arms control
were the big challenges,

17:17.837 --> 17:19.239
but it was actually
during an era

17:19.339 --> 17:22.108
when environmental issues
began to be implemented

17:22.175 --> 17:24.411
in places like
the defense department.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.213
At the turn of the century,

17:26.313 --> 17:28.181
there began to be recognition

17:28.281 --> 17:30.950
that there was a nexus between

17:31.118 --> 17:33.453
what's happening
in climate change

17:33.553 --> 17:36.423
and national security.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.496
We've seen this estimation
of climate change

17:43.596 --> 17:45.232
as a significant risk

17:45.332 --> 17:47.600
since the early days of the George W.
Bush administration.

17:47.700 --> 17:52.139
The very first report from the
department of defense was in 2003

17:52.239 --> 17:54.507
and identified the potential
national security implications

17:54.607 --> 17:56.476
of abrupt climate change.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.247
I was asked to take on
this challenge directly

18:00.347 --> 18:03.150
in about the 2006 time frame,

18:03.250 --> 18:05.051
and so I gathered the nation's

18:05.152 --> 18:07.254
leading retired
military officers.

18:07.354 --> 18:11.158
As a group, we are not your
traditional environmentalists.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.226
CNA's military advisory board

18:13.326 --> 18:16.296
is a group of senior retired
admirals and generals

18:16.396 --> 18:19.166
from all five services that
have changed the conversation.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.568
The view of the military
advisory board

18:21.668 --> 18:25.305
is that we can't wait until
we have absolute certainty.

18:25.405 --> 18:29.008
If we wait,
we might wait too long.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.744
We released our initial report

18:31.844 --> 18:34.647
"national security and
the threat of climate change"

18:34.747 --> 18:36.349
in 2007.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.518
We realized that climate change

18:38.618 --> 18:41.554
would be a threat multiplier
for instability.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.791
People become desperate because
they have extreme weather

18:44.891 --> 18:46.493
and the seas are rising

18:46.593 --> 18:49.296
and there are floods in one
area and droughts in another.

18:49.396 --> 18:53.266
Fragile states become
more unpredictable.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.202
That was definitional.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.769
When that study came out,

18:56.869 --> 19:01.040
it really set a baseline for how
to talk about this issue.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.575
One of the key recommendations

19:02.675 --> 19:04.211
of the CNA report

19:04.311 --> 19:07.046
was to incorporate the
consequences of climate change

19:07.214 --> 19:09.048
into a national
intelligence estimate.

19:09.216 --> 19:12.118
In 2008, the idea
that came out of that report

19:12.219 --> 19:14.287
was climate change exacerbated

19:14.387 --> 19:16.088
existing societal tensions.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.258
Social tensions
and economic costs

19:18.358 --> 19:20.760
could lead to state
or regional instability

19:20.860 --> 19:22.662
threatening U.S. interest.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.431
It could contribute to inter-

19:24.531 --> 19:27.634
and more likely
intrastate conflicts.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.870
Climate change as a threat
to national security

19:30.970 --> 19:32.605
worked its way
into the highest-level

19:32.705 --> 19:35.308
strategic document produced
by the department of defense.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.976
The quadrennial defense review,

19:37.076 --> 19:38.878
the Pentagon's
bedrock strategic document,

19:38.978 --> 19:41.314
has consistently identified
climate change

19:41.414 --> 19:43.816
as an accelerant
of instability or conflict.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.452
It was really the first time

19:45.552 --> 19:48.488
that climate change was
addressed at that level.

19:48.588 --> 19:52.359
We now see this signed out
by the secretaries of defense.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.727
The climate change
adaptation road map

19:54.827 --> 19:57.764
identified climate change
as posing immediate risks

19:57.864 --> 19:59.566
to national security.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.370
2014, we found that
the risks of climate change

20:03.470 --> 20:05.204
are continuing to accelerate

20:05.305 --> 20:09.776
and that they are now
a catalyst for conflict.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.143
We've turned the corner,

20:11.244 --> 20:13.246
and we really see
that climate change

20:13.346 --> 20:16.683
is one of the big issues
of the 21st century.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.403
I can remember once
getting in a discussion

20:36.503 --> 20:39.772
with a career civilian
at the department of defense

20:39.872 --> 20:41.274
who was expressing concern

20:41.374 --> 20:42.909
about talking
about climate change

20:43.009 --> 20:45.445
and said we have to use language

20:45.545 --> 20:47.480
that doesn't, you know,
offend people,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.449
that doesn't say
this is really happening.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.284
And I just looked at him
and I said,

20:51.384 --> 20:54.220
"that's incompatible
with U.S. government policy,"

20:54.321 --> 20:56.289
and I, you know,
cited all these reports,

20:56.389 --> 20:57.924
and said, "you need to look"

20:58.024 --> 20:59.692
at what your own
government is saying

20:59.792 --> 21:01.794
"and work from that."

21:06.533 --> 21:08.635
We're gonna begin by recognizing

21:08.735 --> 21:09.969
where admiral David Titley

21:10.069 --> 21:13.373
was a member of CNA
military advisory board.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.708
Whenever you're ready,
please begin.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.444
I'm here today
not only representing

21:17.544 --> 21:19.779
my views on security
implications of climate change,

21:19.879 --> 21:23.249
but on the collective wisdom
of 16 admirals and generals.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.685
Sir, our collective,
bottom-line judgment

21:25.785 --> 21:28.388
is that climate change
is an accelerating risk

21:28.488 --> 21:30.457
to our nation's future.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.759
These serious impacts
to our security

21:32.859 --> 21:34.461
will only continue to increase

21:34.561 --> 21:36.763
in both frequency
and consequence.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.898
Failure to think about
how climate change

21:38.998 --> 21:41.668
might impact our globally
interconnected systems

21:41.768 --> 21:45.004
and all elements
of U.S. power and security

21:45.104 --> 21:47.607
is frankly a failure
of imagination.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.800
There's a tendency to separate

22:13.900 --> 22:17.437
thinking about domestic events
from international events

22:17.537 --> 22:20.473
as if that was a real barrier.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.511
What we do in this country

22:24.611 --> 22:27.046
has a strong impact on people
elsewhere in the world

22:27.146 --> 22:28.681
and vice versa.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.417
So you really have
to start looking

22:30.450 --> 22:33.586
at reciprocal interactions
between events

22:33.686 --> 22:35.888
in different parts of the world.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.563
When it comes to something
like climate change,

22:43.663 --> 22:46.966
you begin to worry
about phenomena

22:47.066 --> 22:48.568
that you weren't counting on

22:48.668 --> 22:51.904
kicking in at some
indeterminate level.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.909
Russia is on fire.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.811
More than 500 wildfires

22:58.911 --> 23:01.514
raging across
the drought-plagued country.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.149
The heat wave
has ravaged farm land

23:03.249 --> 23:04.984
and destroyed crops over an area

23:05.084 --> 23:06.453
the size of Portugal.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.455
This disaster could destroy

23:08.555 --> 23:11.290
one of the nation's
biggest exports, wheat.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.960
In 2010, there was
a major drought

23:14.060 --> 23:15.327
which led to heat waves

23:15.462 --> 23:17.664
in Russia and Ukraine
and in China,

23:17.764 --> 23:21.333
which really devastated the
wheat crop in those countries.

23:21.468 --> 23:25.004
It's the worst drought
in 200 years.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.106
China's in a crisis,

23:27.206 --> 23:29.476
but this is one
for the world to watch.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.544
Commodity traders have reacted

23:31.644 --> 23:32.745
to the fires and drought

23:32.845 --> 23:34.514
by pushing up the price of wheat

23:34.614 --> 23:36.583
to a 23-month high.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.585
China, Russia started buying

23:38.685 --> 23:40.587
a lot of wheat
on the global food market,

23:40.687 --> 23:44.356
drove the prices up
significantly.

23:44.491 --> 23:47.393
Because food is traded globally,

23:47.494 --> 23:49.328
food prices can be influenced

23:49.496 --> 23:51.998
by what's going on
all over the world.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.601
If you are buying bread

23:54.701 --> 23:58.037
in Damascus or in Cairo,

23:58.137 --> 24:02.174
that grain has been traded
on an international market,

24:02.274 --> 24:04.611
so it is sensitive
to climate fluctuations

24:04.711 --> 24:07.680
from Kansas,
the Southern Australia,

24:07.780 --> 24:11.651
and in Uruguay and Argentina.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.687
What happens globally matters.

24:16.923 --> 24:20.426
Globalization is inherently
unpredictable.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.628
Since agricultural commodities

24:21.728 --> 24:24.230
are all in one
global market now,

24:24.330 --> 24:26.165
what China does
when it panic-buys

24:26.265 --> 24:29.435
is it affects markets
all over the world.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.704
Large shocks
on the global food supply

24:31.804 --> 24:34.106
will always affect
the most vulnerable people,

24:34.206 --> 24:37.677
because when the prices are being
determined internationally,

24:37.777 --> 24:41.113
the food will go to those people
who have the most money.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.749
Inevitably,
the poorer of the world

24:42.849 --> 24:46.819
will be the ones who bear
the brunt of any shortfall.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.990
Now, Egypt is one
of those countries

24:51.090 --> 24:54.961
that's heavily dependent
on the global food market.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.564
With a population
of more than 80 million,

24:57.597 --> 24:59.899
the demand for daily bread
is high.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.570
It has made Egypt the world's
largest importer of wheat.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.572
In a number of areas
around the country,

25:05.638 --> 25:08.007
the price of wheat went up 300%.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.576
In a country that has to import

25:09.642 --> 25:11.578
more than half
the wheat it needs,

25:11.611 --> 25:14.146
flour has started to look
like gold dust.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.583
Russia stopped exporting wheat

25:16.683 --> 25:18.685
to the middle east
during that period.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.853
Due to abnormally high
temperatures and drought,

25:20.953 --> 25:23.690
I believe it is reasonable
to introduce

25:23.790 --> 25:26.926
a temporary ban on grain
and wheat product exports

25:27.026 --> 25:30.997
from the territory
of the Russian Federation.

25:31.097 --> 25:34.033
When they cut that wheat off,

25:34.133 --> 25:36.402
things became very unstable.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.078
This is what
popular uprising looks like.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.783
Protesters demanding
bread and freedom

25:50.883 --> 25:54.286
and calling for government
officials to step down.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.122
If you either don't have food

25:56.222 --> 25:59.859
or you have food but now you have
to pay a whole lot more for it

25:59.959 --> 26:02.261
and you don't have
that disposable income,

26:02.361 --> 26:04.631
it becomes a huge threat.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.465
You're probably
gonna do something about it.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.869
These protests seem to be
a kind of chain reaction

26:09.969 --> 26:12.839
across the middle east.

26:12.939 --> 26:16.542
For decades, anger has simmered
throughout the Arab world...

26:16.643 --> 26:18.144
anger over corrupt governments,

26:18.244 --> 26:19.946
poverty, and a lack of freedom.

26:20.046 --> 26:23.650
It's not just this very simple
"if a, then b."

26:23.716 --> 26:26.352
Climate change can be
one of the causes

26:26.452 --> 26:28.487
in kind of
a chain of events scenario

26:28.688 --> 26:30.156
like in the Arab spring

26:30.256 --> 26:34.727
that exacerbates an already
volatile political situation.

26:35.995 --> 26:39.799
Central Cairo, a battlefield.

26:39.899 --> 26:43.169
Bullets were flying
around Tahrir square.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.007
Protesters looted weapons

26:48.107 --> 26:50.142
and turned them on police.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.281
The sudden shocks
of climate change

26:55.381 --> 26:59.852
can lead to disruptions
and collapses.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.155
So you're gonna have
fragile social systems

27:03.255 --> 27:05.825
that just need one more shock

27:05.925 --> 27:08.861
to tip them over the edge
into a different configuration,

27:08.961 --> 27:10.763
into social breakdown, into war.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.043
We have had,
for a couple of generations,

27:24.143 --> 27:28.180
a sense that food
is not part of politics.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.983
This is short-term, I'm afraid.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.352
The problems
that we're having now

27:33.452 --> 27:35.154
are unfortunately
a small fore taste

27:35.254 --> 27:37.556
of what can happen because
of the interdependence

27:37.724 --> 27:40.092
of climate, economics,
and politics.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.799
It's generally the case

27:46.899 --> 27:50.169
that all societies
seem to have trouble

27:50.269 --> 27:53.205
thinking about the middle
and the long-term future.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.910
Since there is a history
of catastrophe,

27:58.010 --> 28:00.312
when we look at ourselves
in the present day,

28:00.412 --> 28:03.315
history is the only opportunity
that we have for perspective.

28:08.755 --> 28:11.758
When we look back
into the historical record,

28:11.858 --> 28:14.060
we actually see that
the collapse of civilizations,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.895
places like Angkor Wat,

28:15.995 --> 28:18.364
where whole political
systems crumbled,

28:18.464 --> 28:20.032
those things
seem to have occurred

28:20.132 --> 28:22.601
right at the same time
that really large-scale

28:22.769 --> 28:24.036
global climatic changes
were occurring.

28:24.136 --> 28:27.907
The tong dynasty and
the classic Maya civilization

28:28.007 --> 28:30.176
collapsed at almost
exactly the same time

28:30.276 --> 28:32.779
on opposite sides
of the pacific ocean.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.781
There was this large-scale event

28:34.881 --> 28:36.916
that led to systematic
drying and warming

28:37.016 --> 28:38.384
throughout both
of these regions,

28:38.484 --> 28:42.688
and two great
civilizations fell.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.657
There was a really coherent,
vivid picture

28:45.792 --> 28:48.027
about how human society
around the world

28:48.127 --> 28:49.128
and throughout time

28:49.228 --> 28:52.631
has been interacting
with the climate.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.101
Anywhere we look,
we see the same thing.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.703
It's probably one of the most
repeated findings

28:57.804 --> 29:01.841
in the last several years
in the field.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.976
Past societies could observe
crop failure,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.312
but they didn't know how
to explain it.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.915
What gives us a chance
is that we can observe

29:09.015 --> 29:11.383
not only local symptoms
of a problem like crop failure.

29:11.483 --> 29:14.053
We can also observe the entire
globe and draw conclusions.

29:14.153 --> 29:17.289
The question is whether we decide
we're gonna do that or not.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.537
Today I want to speak to you

29:31.637 --> 29:32.939
about the national
security risks

29:33.039 --> 29:36.843
posed by a changing climate.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.011
Just last month,
the administration issued

29:39.111 --> 29:42.849
its 2015
national security strategy.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.384
The strategy
includes climate change

29:45.484 --> 29:48.454
as one of eight
top strategic risks

29:48.554 --> 29:51.390
along with a catastrophic attack

29:51.490 --> 29:52.959
on the United States soil

29:53.059 --> 29:56.929
and the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.

29:57.029 --> 30:01.033
Climate change, once considered
an issue for a distant future,

30:01.133 --> 30:05.071
has moved firmly
into the present.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.739
We saw this
dramatically happen here

30:07.840 --> 30:10.843
in the United States
with super storm Sandy.

30:12.879 --> 30:15.982
The storm surge went over
a 12 1/2 foot wall

30:16.082 --> 30:19.118
protecting a electrical system

30:19.218 --> 30:24.090
and immediately plunged
lower Manhattan into darkness.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.228
Without electricity,

30:29.328 --> 30:31.163
our transportation
and health sectors

30:31.263 --> 30:33.966
began to collapse.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.939
We can see from events
over the last few years

30:40.039 --> 30:43.175
the increasing not only severity
of natural disasters,

30:43.275 --> 30:47.947
but the unpredictability
of their consequences.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.049
As our world becomes
more interconnected,

30:50.149 --> 30:53.319
as disasters happen in different
and unpredictable ways,

30:53.419 --> 30:56.322
they cause cascading impacts
through our communities,

30:56.422 --> 30:59.258
through our societies,
through our infrastructure.

31:01.593 --> 31:05.364
The potential for what we call
cascading disasters

31:05.464 --> 31:06.966
are much closer to home.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.939
We're seeing in the west
of the United States

31:13.039 --> 31:15.141
unprecedented drought...

31:18.044 --> 31:21.247
Which sparks forest fires.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.152
At the same time,
we might need to be responding

31:26.252 --> 31:29.956
to increased activity
in the arctic.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.959
We might be seeing
sea level rise in Florida

31:33.059 --> 31:34.493
and on the east coast

31:34.593 --> 31:37.964
interact with major storms
that might become more intense.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.467
And as we go forward
as the climate changes,

31:41.567 --> 31:45.671
we might see those things start
to happen simultaneously.

31:45.771 --> 31:48.407
Are we ready to deal
with multiple disasters

31:48.507 --> 31:50.809
at the same time
within the United States?

31:50.977 --> 31:53.045
That's an open question.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.184
We've also got to think about

31:58.284 --> 32:00.119
the security
of our bases at home.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.488
Norfolk, Virginia,
is where the vast majority

32:02.588 --> 32:06.125
of the U.S. Navy's Atlantic
combat capability is based.

32:06.225 --> 32:10.096
It's also at extreme risk
of sea level rise.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.264
The Hampton roads
region of my state

32:12.364 --> 32:14.533
is home to the largest naval
installation in the world,

32:14.633 --> 32:16.135
naval station Norfolk.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.704
Studies show
that the main Norfolk road

32:18.804 --> 32:20.839
into the largest naval base
in the world

32:21.007 --> 32:23.842
by 2040 will be inundated
by daily tides,

32:24.010 --> 32:25.377
not even storm surges.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.346
They're already raising
the level of the piers.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.115
At the level they're at,
they're not gonna be able

32:29.215 --> 32:31.417
to service the ships
that are coming in.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.186
This is our largest
naval base in the world.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.423
There's serious
considerations here.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.126
The welfare of Norfolk
has global implications

32:40.226 --> 32:41.893
because of the power
that is projected

32:42.028 --> 32:44.263
from that place
around the world.

32:44.363 --> 32:47.099
It's not just the case
where you'll deploy these forces

32:47.199 --> 32:49.101
in a particular conflict,

32:49.201 --> 32:50.402
but you'll also
have to deploy them

32:50.502 --> 32:52.138
to respond to catastrophic
weather events,

32:52.238 --> 32:54.040
and the prime example that I use

32:54.140 --> 32:58.044
is typhoon Haiyan
in the Philippines.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.447
We sent some 14,000
soldiers, sailors, airmen,

33:01.547 --> 33:04.550
and marines in response
to that catastrophic event.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.087
We were the only country
that's capable of doing that,

33:08.187 --> 33:09.588
of deploying
that amount of forces,

33:09.688 --> 33:11.190
that amount of distance.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.125
As the sea levels rise,

33:13.225 --> 33:15.061
as the storm surges increase,

33:15.127 --> 33:16.762
as the rain rates increase,

33:16.862 --> 33:18.897
it then becomes
a capacity issue.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.899
How much of that can you do

33:21.067 --> 33:23.435
before you start impacting
other missions?

33:23.535 --> 33:25.171
Every two weeks
the U.S. military

33:25.271 --> 33:26.505
now is getting
a disaster response.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.241
So those same sailors
leave Norfolk, Virginia,

33:29.341 --> 33:31.910
challenged by climate change,
challenged by sea level rise,

33:32.078 --> 33:33.112
sail halfway around the world,

33:33.212 --> 33:35.081
respond to a series of disasters

33:35.147 --> 33:36.382
that are related
to extreme weather events

33:36.482 --> 33:39.185
in the heavily populated
pacific rim,

33:39.285 --> 33:41.620
and on the way home they may
steam through the middle east

33:41.720 --> 33:43.189
where a civil war in Syria

33:43.289 --> 33:46.092
and now in other parts
of the region continues to rage,

33:46.158 --> 33:47.926
that in many ways
was accelerated by a drought

33:48.094 --> 33:49.195
that was worse because
of climate change.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.230
So they're seeing
the impacts of this

33:51.330 --> 33:53.599
from the time they'd get on the
boat and go on the deployment

33:53.699 --> 33:56.568
to the time they get home.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.805
We're gonna have to make an increasingly
difficult series of choices.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.240
We're already
making those choices

34:01.340 --> 34:03.209
about where to go
and where to use resources,

34:03.309 --> 34:06.112
when to respond and when not to.

34:28.867 --> 34:32.371
80% of New Orleans
underwater right now.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.507
I said, "we was planning on
leaving tomorrow if we could."

34:38.543 --> 34:41.179
There's no question
that communities

34:41.280 --> 34:45.717
that have fewer resources
are going to suffer more.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.353
If you look in this country,

34:47.453 --> 34:49.855
the effects
are going to be uneven.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.790
Some places
are going to experience

34:51.889 --> 34:56.462
more dramatic effects
than others.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.164
People trapped in buildings

34:58.197 --> 34:59.531
that have come down around them.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.169
They have made desperate calls
to 911 asking for help,

35:03.202 --> 35:06.272
asking for rescue,
but the rescuers can't get out.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.207
People are now
living in parking garages.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.075
Others picked up what they could

35:10.176 --> 35:12.344
and moved to higher ground
on the interstate,

35:12.444 --> 35:15.347
refugees in their own home town.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.882
We don't have transportation.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.817
I mean, we living
paycheck to paycheck.

35:18.917 --> 35:22.188
It ain't like we're just able
to get up and just leave.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.224
Those people who ignored
the evacuation orders

35:25.324 --> 35:28.460
are simply going to have to wait
and rescue themselves.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.762
Thousands of evacuees

35:30.862 --> 35:33.499
sought refuge
inside the super dome,

35:33.599 --> 35:36.202
only to be subjected
to an unspeakable

35:36.268 --> 35:39.037
breakdown of law and order.

35:39.205 --> 35:42.774
What Katrina shows is
that climate-related events

35:42.874 --> 35:46.745
can create massive distress
on a scale of a whole urban area

35:46.845 --> 35:48.214
and that that massive distress

35:48.280 --> 35:50.216
can involve the collapse
of state structures.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.251
You would never, never imagine

35:52.351 --> 35:54.786
what you saw in the convention
center in New Orleans.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.223
They are just left behind.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.893
There's nothing offered to them
for the last four days.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.295
They got children out here!

36:03.395 --> 36:05.063
They got pregnant
women out here!

36:05.231 --> 36:06.698
They won't even bring water!

36:06.798 --> 36:08.234
They won't bring food!

36:08.334 --> 36:12.271
You gotta go steal water
to drink to survive out here.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.105
One can try to bracket that off

36:14.240 --> 36:15.807
as some kind
of exceptional event,

36:15.907 --> 36:19.077
but in fact Katrina is
a perfectly normal demonstration

36:19.278 --> 36:21.347
of what actually happens.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.781
Drop.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.115
If the weather gets to the point

36:24.250 --> 36:26.084
where it can break down
city governments,

36:26.285 --> 36:27.486
and let's say it happens

36:27.586 --> 36:29.255
to two or three city governments
at the same time

36:29.355 --> 36:31.290
and federal authorities
are not only unwilling

36:31.390 --> 36:35.093
but unable to assist,
then you get hurricane Katrina

36:35.294 --> 36:36.295
on a national scale.

36:36.395 --> 36:39.865
We want help!
We want help!

36:39.965 --> 36:42.568
We want help!

37:18.470 --> 37:21.773
We've built society
on this implicit assumption

37:21.873 --> 37:25.477
of climate stability.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.381
Within bounds, we know
what we're gonna get.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.186
We know when to plant.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.656
We know about how much
rain is gonna come.

37:41.460 --> 37:44.763
Because we built our society
on this climate stability

37:44.863 --> 37:47.533
and that stability is changing,

37:47.633 --> 37:51.169
all these things
that we take for granted,

37:51.337 --> 37:54.673
they're not just givens anymore.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.052
Across the Sahel,
the crops have failed.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.822
Hunger is stalking
tens of millions.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.791
People are abandoning
their livestock

38:12.891 --> 38:15.193
and moving to wherever
they can find water.

38:15.361 --> 38:18.630
Relief workers fear if more
help doesn't come soon,

38:18.730 --> 38:20.566
millions will starve.

38:22.568 --> 38:25.270
The Sahel is
the semi-arid region

38:25.371 --> 38:27.506
that stretches
from the Atlantic ocean

38:27.606 --> 38:29.675
all the way over to Ethiopia.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.210
It's the transition zone
between the Sahara

38:32.378 --> 38:34.145
and the more humid,
forested conditions

38:34.380 --> 38:37.215
further south.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.217
That is a very
drought-prone region.

38:39.385 --> 38:43.389
There's a lot of people making
their livelihood off agriculture,

38:43.455 --> 38:45.591
and whenever there are droughts,

38:45.691 --> 38:48.460
it leads a lot of people
to migrate.

38:56.768 --> 39:00.839
The Sahel is already
a major conflict zone,

39:00.939 --> 39:05.477
both with Islamic militants
and also nationalists.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.418
This is the heart
of the problem in many ways.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.986
Climate change
arrives in a world

39:15.086 --> 39:17.689
that has already
been destabilized.

39:17.789 --> 39:22.528
Darfur, the world's worst
humanitarian crisis.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.898
More than 2 million people
forced to flee their homes

39:26.998 --> 39:30.536
in what's widely portrayed
as an ethnic conflict.

39:30.636 --> 39:34.272
But climatic changes
may also be a factor.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.342
This is a region
where water's getting scarcer

39:37.443 --> 39:39.445
and arable land shrinking,

39:39.511 --> 39:41.513
pitting Arab nomadic grazers

39:41.613 --> 39:44.516
against the predominantly
black farmers.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.855
A lot of the violence that is now
accelerated by climate change

39:49.955 --> 39:53.525
actually has its roots in these
older, deeper conflicts.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.128
The drought exacerbated

39:57.228 --> 39:59.565
existing societal cleavages.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.734
There it was Muslim
and Christian.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.637
It was the herders
versus the agrarians.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.439
In every case, climate change

40:07.539 --> 40:09.207
acted as a threat multiplier.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.514
The numbers from Darfur
are staggering.

40:15.614 --> 40:20.486
Since 2003, an estimated 400,000
people have been killed.

40:20.952 --> 40:24.623
Another 2 1/2 million have been
forced into refugee camps

40:24.723 --> 40:28.093
in neighboring
countries like Chad.

40:30.128 --> 40:34.332
Drought and hunger have
made communities vulnerable.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.402
Coups and rebellions
have made it unstable.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.605
This fragile state
is now threatened

40:39.705 --> 40:42.708
by poverty and neglect.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.544
Climate change unfolds
on the landscape,

40:45.644 --> 40:47.913
making their lives harder.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.516
But the poverty
that was originally there

40:50.616 --> 40:54.152
makes the response
to climate change worse.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.757
A staggering 30 million people

40:58.857 --> 41:01.627
are thought to survive
on lake Chad's ecosystem.

41:01.727 --> 41:04.863
But what was once
of the world's largest lakes

41:04.963 --> 41:09.735
has in just 40 years
shrunk by 90%.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.704
Lake Chad, where
boko haram fighters

41:12.804 --> 41:16.174
have launched recent attacks.

41:16.274 --> 41:19.811
Water scarcity has caused
migration and instability

41:19.911 --> 41:24.650
which boko haram has been able
to take advantage of.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.953
Where there is already
instability,

41:28.053 --> 41:30.756
extremists thrive.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.691
More than a million people

41:32.791 --> 41:35.794
have been forced to flee from
boko haram's wave of terror.

41:39.765 --> 41:42.333
When you look at the modeling
that's being done now

41:42.568 --> 41:44.570
for north Africa,

41:44.670 --> 41:47.773
we see significantly
more drying.

41:47.873 --> 41:51.142
We see significant
precipitation decline

41:51.242 --> 41:53.712
well beyond what it is now.

42:05.657 --> 42:06.958
Africa's a place where

42:07.058 --> 42:09.795
very large numbers
of people need more land.

42:09.895 --> 42:13.632
At the same time, something like
half of the unused arable land

42:13.732 --> 42:15.667
in the world is in Africa.

42:17.268 --> 42:21.607
Is colonialism taking root
in Africa once again?

42:21.707 --> 42:22.908
Some of the countries
on that continent

42:23.008 --> 42:24.776
may be the poorest in the world,

42:24.876 --> 42:26.612
but the lush farmlands
are the envy

42:26.678 --> 42:30.048
of richer nations
with infertile soil.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.483
We've already seen
in the not-so-distant past

42:32.618 --> 42:34.820
how China,
when there's a drought,

42:34.920 --> 42:38.624
will panic-buy
agricultural commodities.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.459
What if things were much worse?

42:41.627 --> 42:42.794
What if that same country

42:42.894 --> 42:44.696
thought that it doesn't
just need to panic-buy,

42:44.796 --> 42:49.100
it needs to buy or lease
vast territories?

42:49.200 --> 42:51.502
This is a scenario
which could unfold gradually

42:51.637 --> 42:54.673
without anyone
really seeing it coming.

42:54.773 --> 42:57.142
Slowly, slowly, slowly,
China controls,

42:57.242 --> 42:59.177
at least legally,
an awful lot of territory

42:59.277 --> 43:02.213
beyond its borders.

43:02.313 --> 43:05.817
Whether one wants to moralize
and call that a land grab,

43:05.917 --> 43:08.519
you can get a situation
where the local people

43:08.654 --> 43:10.121
could have another idea.

43:25.036 --> 43:26.872
If you're Chinese authorities,

43:26.972 --> 43:30.676
you would rather have
instability in Africa

43:30.742 --> 43:33.845
than instability at home.

43:51.830 --> 43:55.801
We take our lifestyle
as being a fixed point

43:55.901 --> 43:57.703
and then if anything's
going to change,

43:57.736 --> 43:59.971
it's gonna be something else,

44:00.071 --> 44:03.909
preferably something far away.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.748
In the United States,
although we've done the most

44:09.848 --> 44:11.817
to promote global warming,

44:11.917 --> 44:14.219
we're gonna get hit by it
after other people

44:14.319 --> 44:18.323
are gonna be hit by it.

44:18.423 --> 44:19.991
In advanced societies,

44:20.091 --> 44:23.361
we're very vulnerable
to confusing lifestyle

44:23.461 --> 44:25.997
with life itself.

45:00.766 --> 45:04.269
As the situation in Syria
has deteriorated sharply,

45:04.369 --> 45:07.438
Jordan's Za'atari camp
for Syrian refugees

45:07.538 --> 45:09.975
is now the size of a city.

45:15.947 --> 45:17.282
After leaving the army I worked

45:17.382 --> 45:19.450
with refugees on the ground
in the middle east,

45:19.550 --> 45:22.220
in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon,

45:22.320 --> 45:24.422
having seen what happens
when millions of people

45:24.522 --> 45:26.257
uproot and leave a place,

45:26.357 --> 45:27.893
the impact it has on them,

45:27.993 --> 45:31.797
the impact it has on the country
they've taken refuge in,

45:31.863 --> 45:33.965
this has major consequences.

45:34.065 --> 45:37.903
That on a massive scale where
whole nations are on the move

45:38.003 --> 45:40.305
may be what we're facing
in certain climate scenarios.

45:43.574 --> 45:44.810
The world is in the grips

45:44.910 --> 45:45.911
of the worst refugee crisis

45:46.011 --> 45:47.813
since the second world war.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.981
The vast majority
of those refugees

45:50.081 --> 45:53.284
are hosted by some of
the world's poorest countries.

45:57.823 --> 46:00.191
This camp is just overwhelmed

46:00.291 --> 46:02.894
by the amount
of people coming here.

46:05.130 --> 46:08.266
For the refugees, it's been
a litany of killings,

46:08.366 --> 46:11.169
kidnappings, hunger,
and economic chaos.

46:12.838 --> 46:14.739
The U.N.'S refugee agency

46:14.840 --> 46:18.509
estimates the current total
at almost 60 million.

46:18.609 --> 46:21.679
Shockingly, half are children.

46:21.847 --> 46:23.949
We don't have the resources

46:24.049 --> 46:27.585
to support all the victims
of conflict around the world.

46:27.685 --> 46:31.556
We are no longer
able to pick up the pieces.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.226
The loss of livelihood

46:35.326 --> 46:38.897
is definitely
a human security risk.

46:38.997 --> 46:40.298
In certain situations,

46:40.398 --> 46:43.334
it can become an international
security risk.

46:50.876 --> 46:54.512
A desperate search for nearly
1,000 people feared dead

46:54.612 --> 46:56.181
after a ship
packed with migrants

46:56.281 --> 46:58.216
capsized in
the Mediterranean sea.

46:58.316 --> 47:01.953
It is the latest in a string
of deadly migrant boat sinkings.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.722
Refugees fleeing Isis
and other militants

47:04.890 --> 47:06.892
trying desperately
to cross into Europe.

47:06.992 --> 47:08.293
Italy's coast guard and Navy

47:08.393 --> 47:11.262
rescued 11,000 people
from the Mediterranean

47:11.362 --> 47:13.899
in the last week alone.

47:13.965 --> 47:16.534
Europe is suffering
a major migration crisis

47:16.634 --> 47:19.037
because of
the conflicts in Syria,

47:19.137 --> 47:22.140
the wider middle east,
and east Africa.

47:22.240 --> 47:25.343
They've been arriving
by the boatloads

47:25.443 --> 47:27.212
on European shores daily.

47:27.312 --> 47:30.081
Now the head of the U.N.'S
refugee agency

47:30.181 --> 47:33.084
is calling the migrant crisis
in the Mediterranean

47:33.184 --> 47:35.753
total chaos.

47:35.921 --> 47:37.222
They're willing
to risk their lives

47:37.322 --> 47:39.790
and their family lives
to get to Europe.

47:39.991 --> 47:41.192
That's pretty desperate.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.429
It's a refugee crisis

47:44.529 --> 47:48.833
with no precedent
in the European union's history.

47:48.934 --> 47:51.836
As their numbers spiral
along with the death count,

47:51.937 --> 47:54.973
Europe is under
acute pressure to act.

47:57.242 --> 47:59.844
Tensions are at boiling point.

47:59.945 --> 48:01.479
Macedonia closed its border.

48:01.579 --> 48:04.649
Special forces fired
stun grenades into the crowd.

48:04.749 --> 48:07.352
The E.U.'S response
has been criticized

48:07.452 --> 48:11.957
as at best incoherent and at
worst callous and inhumane.

48:12.023 --> 48:14.960
We're gonna put in more fencing,
more resources.

48:14.993 --> 48:16.995
The politics
of the armed lifeboat

48:17.095 --> 48:18.863
refers to an acknowledgement

48:18.964 --> 48:20.265
that, yes, there is a crisis,

48:20.365 --> 48:23.969
but, no, we are not
all in it together.

48:24.002 --> 48:28.006
We have to keep the victims
of this crisis out

48:28.106 --> 48:32.410
so we can carry on as before
on the other side of the wall.

48:35.180 --> 48:39.617
What's alarming
is the behavior of people

48:39.717 --> 48:43.088
in extreme circumstances

48:43.188 --> 48:45.223
taking the risks they do.

48:48.159 --> 48:52.263
People in countries
where instability was reigning,

48:52.363 --> 48:56.267
they feel that they have
no other choice.

48:56.367 --> 48:59.104
With the continuing turmoil
in the middle east,

48:59.204 --> 49:02.440
the number of desperate people
willing to risk everything

49:02.540 --> 49:04.209
is expected to rise.

49:13.184 --> 49:14.352
Okay?

49:15.053 --> 49:17.122
When we really step back,

49:17.222 --> 49:19.224
people are pretty much the same.

49:19.324 --> 49:23.394
We want adequate food,
adequate shelter,

49:23.494 --> 49:25.196
safe water.

49:25.296 --> 49:29.034
If you have large numbers
of displaced people

49:29.100 --> 49:32.070
and their needs
are not being met,

49:32.170 --> 49:35.640
then this becomes
a potential for instability.

50:23.888 --> 50:26.591
Who is a climate refugee
and who is an economic refugee?

50:26.691 --> 50:29.060
It's impossible to say.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.529
The two things
are bound up together.

50:34.332 --> 50:38.069
Most climate refugees
are not displaced

50:38.169 --> 50:41.072
so clearly by climate change.

50:41.172 --> 50:43.308
Rather it's a mix of forces

50:43.408 --> 50:46.644
that drives them off the land.

50:46.744 --> 50:48.079
Under international law,

50:48.179 --> 50:52.083
there is no status
of climate refugee.

50:52.183 --> 50:54.285
Part of this is political.

50:54.385 --> 50:55.786
Because if there were,

50:55.886 --> 50:57.388
then it would compel nations

50:57.488 --> 51:00.491
to accept climate migrants
as asylees.

51:04.662 --> 51:07.765
The longer
that climate change goes on,

51:07.865 --> 51:09.767
the more that we feel it,

51:09.867 --> 51:11.469
the more that we experience it,

51:11.569 --> 51:15.140
people are gonna
wanna come north.

51:15.240 --> 51:19.043
The only border which is real
is the atmosphere.

51:19.144 --> 51:21.212
Everything else is permeable.

51:46.671 --> 51:49.507
Linear thinking says
that if you have

51:49.607 --> 51:52.277
a change of a certain magnitude
in a system,

51:52.377 --> 51:57.182
you can predict the change
in its output.

51:57.215 --> 52:00.017
Non-linearity says
relatively small changes

52:00.185 --> 52:03.954
can lead to very large
and unpredictable circumstances

52:04.189 --> 52:07.057
on the output side.

52:07.192 --> 52:10.195
Let's suppose that the rate
of which the climate is changing

52:10.261 --> 52:12.663
is not linear but is on a curve

52:12.763 --> 52:14.232
that's getting very steep.

52:16.767 --> 52:19.704
Take the rate at which
arctic ice is melting,

52:21.839 --> 52:25.610
the rate at which
the glaciers are retreating.

52:25.710 --> 52:28.045
At the beginning
of these processes,

52:28.213 --> 52:29.447
you create a graph.

52:29.547 --> 52:31.616
If I start measuring over time,

52:31.716 --> 52:34.952
I keep on discovering
things are happening faster

52:35.220 --> 52:38.055
than you might expect.

52:38.223 --> 52:39.690
And all of our old projections

52:39.790 --> 52:43.428
turn out to be
excessively conservative.

52:50.601 --> 52:52.370
I worry about a discrepancy

52:52.470 --> 52:53.671
between the rate at which

52:53.771 --> 52:56.241
we set out
to deal with these things

52:56.307 --> 52:58.843
and the rate at which
they are occurring.

53:04.315 --> 53:05.383
What keeps me up at night

53:05.483 --> 53:06.884
is a problem
of compounding risk.

53:06.984 --> 53:08.586
A good example is Bangladesh.

53:12.022 --> 53:16.361
Bangladesh is probably the
ground zero of climate change.

53:16.461 --> 53:18.663
The impacts are going
to be more severe

53:18.763 --> 53:21.131
in Bangladesh
than many other countries

53:21.266 --> 53:23.734
where they have
smaller population size.

53:26.271 --> 53:29.374
In a climate scenario
where sea level rise occurs,

53:29.474 --> 53:31.376
especially if it occurs rapidly,

53:31.476 --> 53:32.910
there's a real risk

53:33.010 --> 53:35.413
that a large portion
of the Bangladeshi population

53:35.513 --> 53:36.881
is gonna have to move.

53:39.350 --> 53:41.852
The sea level will continue
to rise in the coming years,

53:41.952 --> 53:45.690
because there is melting
at a faster rate than ever.

53:45.790 --> 53:49.360
If there is a one-meter
sea level rise,

53:49.460 --> 53:52.997
Bangladesh will lose about
20% of its land mass.

53:55.300 --> 53:57.868
We are going to see a very large

53:57.968 --> 54:01.406
climate refugee population.

54:01.506 --> 54:03.441
Researchers have
estimated the numbers

54:03.541 --> 54:05.610
to be about 30 million.

54:07.378 --> 54:11.416
This is a humanitarian crisis
of epic proportions.

54:13.484 --> 54:16.421
Where are these refugees
going to go?

54:18.989 --> 54:22.660
India has already
unilaterally fenced Bangladesh

54:22.760 --> 54:24.795
on all three sides.

54:28.333 --> 54:29.934
A ten-foot, double-sided,

54:30.034 --> 54:34.505
razor-wire-topped, what may be
the world's first climate fence.

54:34.605 --> 54:38.175
It's inspired by Israel's wall
in the west bank,

54:38.343 --> 54:41.612
and it's manned by 80,000
Indian guards.

54:41.712 --> 54:44.148
Death can be the penalty
for crossing it

54:44.349 --> 54:45.816
or even going near it,

54:45.916 --> 54:48.353
with hundreds of unarmed
villagers killed

54:48.386 --> 54:53.157
along what is now one of the most
dangerous frontiers in the world.

54:54.024 --> 54:55.693
There are other reasons
for India to build that fence,

54:55.793 --> 54:58.363
but probably the most pressing
and strategic reason

54:58.396 --> 55:01.699
is to forestall
that climate migration.

55:01.799 --> 55:04.602
No factor can be excluded

55:04.702 --> 55:06.871
from the impacts
of climate change.

55:06.971 --> 55:11.241
We have got to see the
consequences of the consequences.

55:11.376 --> 55:14.044
We are going to see
multiple stressors

55:14.144 --> 55:17.382
coming at one point at one time.

55:17.415 --> 55:20.184
Stress on the water sector,
food sector,

55:20.385 --> 55:23.053
physical infrastructure,

55:23.153 --> 55:26.457
that could lead
to a state collapse.

55:27.658 --> 55:29.894
It will be a problem
of the magnitude

55:29.994 --> 55:32.897
that will destabilize
not only Bangladesh,

55:32.997 --> 55:37.234
but it will severely impact
on international stability,

55:37.402 --> 55:40.805
having consequences
beyond imagination.

55:44.842 --> 55:47.845
We don't now have the luxury,
and we probably never will,

55:47.945 --> 55:50.415
of sort of isolating
one driver of a situation

55:50.515 --> 55:53.451
and saying, "okay, let's solve
for that driver."

55:55.620 --> 55:57.555
We're always going to be
dealing with a layer cake

55:57.655 --> 55:59.490
of inter-connected problems.

56:02.427 --> 56:03.861
So if you have
a climate-change scenario

56:03.961 --> 56:06.831
that's sufficient to raise
the sea level in Bangladesh,

56:06.931 --> 56:09.434
what is that
temperature spike doing

56:09.534 --> 56:10.735
to the Himalayan ice caps

56:10.835 --> 56:12.770
that supply
the annual water cycle

56:12.870 --> 56:15.105
for most of
the agricultural production

56:15.205 --> 56:18.543
in the Asian-pacific region?

56:18.643 --> 56:21.746
So now you've got potential
drought and food scarcity

56:21.846 --> 56:23.681
in one area that's intersecting

56:23.781 --> 56:27.552
with flooding and massive
refugee flows in the other area.

56:31.922 --> 56:34.725
What's the political
situation when it happens?

56:36.894 --> 56:40.465
If India and China are continuing
to have a border dispute

56:40.531 --> 56:42.567
during this period of time,

56:42.667 --> 56:45.703
that border dispute just got
a lot more serious.

56:45.803 --> 56:47.672
This is something
that could place

56:47.772 --> 56:49.974
massive stress
on the international system.

56:53.911 --> 56:56.481
It's these compounding
risk factors,

56:56.547 --> 56:57.748
these compounding dynamics

56:57.848 --> 56:59.684
that I think ought
to really concern us.

57:03.621 --> 57:05.523
If you look at issues
of water flow

57:05.623 --> 57:07.592
from the Himalayan plateau,

57:07.692 --> 57:09.727
there are countries that
are on the receiving end

57:09.827 --> 57:12.830
of those flows of water
that are nuclear-armed.

57:15.700 --> 57:19.604
If the supply of water
becomes increasingly tight,

57:19.704 --> 57:24.509
then if somebody decides
to build a dam on their side,

57:24.542 --> 57:26.944
that can look to somebody
on the losing end

57:27.044 --> 57:28.913
like an act of war.

57:35.085 --> 57:39.389
The risk of any conflict
in the modern world

57:39.590 --> 57:41.792
is magnified by the fact

57:41.892 --> 57:46.030
that at the end
of a chain of escalation,

57:46.130 --> 57:48.432
you might arrive at countries

57:48.533 --> 57:51.602
that have weapons
of mass destruction.

58:33.578 --> 58:37.948
Our entire way of life
is based on fossil fuels.

58:41.886 --> 58:44.755
Everything that you use
and touch in your daily life

58:44.855 --> 58:47.024
in this highly-advanced economy

58:47.124 --> 58:50.795
is moved to you
using that single source.

58:56.801 --> 58:59.637
There's absolutely a link

58:59.737 --> 59:03.941
between the way we use energy
and our security.

59:08.345 --> 59:12.449
Oil is a globally-traded
commodity.

59:12.617 --> 59:15.152
Events around the world
impact the supply

59:15.252 --> 59:17.688
and the price here at home.

59:17.788 --> 59:19.624
When Geo-political
decisions are made,

59:19.657 --> 59:22.459
the price can go down,
the price can go up.

59:22.627 --> 59:25.162
Many of our relationships
with autocracies

59:25.262 --> 59:28.398
have been based in part
on assuring the supply

59:28.633 --> 59:32.002
of fossil fuels.

59:32.102 --> 59:33.771
We spend a tremendous
amount of time

59:33.871 --> 59:37.875
keeping that
global supply flowing,

59:37.975 --> 59:38.943
protecting it.

59:41.245 --> 59:42.713
The threats are being ramped up

59:42.813 --> 59:44.481
over a vital oil shipping route

59:44.649 --> 59:46.316
which Iran
is threatening to block.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.484
The strait of Hormuz

59:47.652 --> 59:48.953
links the oil-producing states

59:49.053 --> 59:51.488
of Bahrain, Kuwait,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia,

59:51.656 --> 59:53.090
and the United Arab Emirates.

59:53.190 --> 59:56.493
That's about 40% of the world's
oil that's shipped.

59:56.661 --> 59:58.663
It's a major artery.

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.497
We spend $85 billion a year

01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:02.700
defending strategic
choke points,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.769
places like the straits
of Harmuz near Iran

01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:06.003
or the straits of Malacca

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:08.806
in the heavily-contested
south China sea.

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:11.075
Real disruption would have

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.811
catastrophic consequences
for our economy.

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:17.514
Energy and natural resources

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.183
creates the arena for conflict

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:22.586
and defining what the playing
field will look like.

01:00:22.687 --> 01:00:26.791
Climate change
is in that mix of causes.

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:30.695
In some cases,
it's changing the map itself.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.663
Melting ice caps in the arctic

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.932
have ignited a military buildup.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:38.035
The arctic circle
is believed to contain 30%

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.270
of the world's
undiscovered natural gas

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.539
and 15% of its oil.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.575
As the ice melts,
it opens up resources.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:47.611
It opens up trade routes.

01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:49.146
It opens up land claims

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:52.282
that could become
more contentious.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:55.185
Russia is making
a very bold move,

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:58.055
planting its flag
on the arctic sea floor.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.157
Russia is holding
military exercises

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:02.392
involving tens
of thousands of troops.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:06.163
It's disputed territory with
the United States and Canada.

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:10.801
Many fear a 21st-century
cold war in the frozen waters.

01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:17.742
I'm honored to welcome three
former secretaries of state.

01:01:17.842 --> 01:01:21.111
We've started a project
on the arctic.

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:23.080
There's a new ocean
being created there.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.350
That hasn't happened
since the last ice age.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:30.220
There are big melts all over
the world taking place.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.289
The climate's changing.

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:34.825
And there are consequences.

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:40.931
If you say there's no connection
between security and climate,

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.934
or between oil
and our national security,

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.302
if you served
in these conflicts,

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.871
if you fought a war
in the middle east,

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:48.072
if you fought
in a burning oil field,

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:51.141
you might have a different view.

01:01:53.778 --> 01:01:54.945
Convoy be advised,

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.314
border patrol vehicle
on the left-hand side.

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:01.919
My first deployment,
I was a young lieutenant

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:05.222
with an infantry unit in Iraq

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:06.423
south of Baghdad

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.092
in an area that was saturated

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:10.828
with improvised
explosive devices.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:16.834
It came to be known
as the triangle of death.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:18.803
That American military unit

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:20.437
on the ground
in Iraq or Afghanistan

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:22.639
has got to rely on a fuel supply

01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:23.841
that comes a great distance

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.944
at risk and cost to reach them.

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:28.913
Every day, a logistics convoy

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:30.680
would have to leave
Baghdad airport

01:02:30.815 --> 01:02:34.084
and drive to our
forward operating base.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.921
We were taking the fuel from
the previous day's delivery,

01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:39.089
putting it in a bunch
of Bradley fighting vehicles,

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:42.459
going out to escort the convoy
in with that fuel,

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:44.061
using a lot of the fuel,

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.830
and then putting
the next day's fuel

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:47.898
right in the Bradleys
to do all over again.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:51.035
We took this highly
capable combat force

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.437
and turned it into, basically,
a self-licking ice cream cone.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:12.022
Is hit.
Is down.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.891
Almost every day,

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:16.426
that convoy was attacked.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:39.449
Next, we're going to hear
from Mr. Michael Breen,

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:40.951
who is the executive director

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.287
of the Truman
national security project.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:44.889
- Welcome, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. chairman.

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:46.356
Chairman Marquis,
ranking member Brasso,

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.758
thank you for the opportunity
to testify today.

01:03:48.893 --> 01:03:51.028
Although we find ourselves in a
considerably better position

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:53.097
with regard to energy
than that of several years ago,

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.966
the lack of diversified
energy sources around the world

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:57.401
continues to create
vulnerabilities

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.470
for the United States
and our allies.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.108
In addition, climate change makes our
current energy system unsustainable,

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:08.913
creating cascading risks
and impacts around the globe.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.614
The U.S. should place
greater emphasis

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:14.919
on efficiency along with the
development of renewable sources,

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:17.988
and more resilient
distributed energy systems.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:21.926
The department of defense

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:23.928
is one of the largest
customers in the world,

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:26.530
so when the department
invests in technologies

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.797
that are still very immature,

01:04:27.932 --> 01:04:29.199
they're taking a very long view

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:30.935
of what they're going to need
in the future.

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:33.270
Those long-term investments
do have a great benefit

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.205
often for the civilian economy.

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:37.641
If the military had settled
on compass technology

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.209
as the perfect answer
to navigation,

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:41.078
we never would have had GPS.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:42.446
So to stay ahead of the curve,

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.348
we have to keep investing.

01:04:44.448 --> 01:04:47.517
And one of the things
I get asked in hearings

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.254
defending the budget is,
"is this the right time

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:54.158
to be investing in stuff
like alternative energy?"

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:59.029
And my response is,
"we can't afford not to now."

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.364
Secretary of the Navy

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:02.299
Ray Mabus took part
in signing a contract

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.235
for the largest biofuel
purchase in government history.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.071
In the next ten years,
the air force academy

01:05:07.171 --> 01:05:09.439
plans to generate
all of their own electricity

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:13.377
through renewable sources.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:16.981
I'm encouraged that the military
is continuing to contribute

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:20.985
to the development
of new technologies,

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:24.454
but I don't think we can
be complacent about this.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:25.990
Our military in the U.S.,

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.657
every military,
is ultimately in the business

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:31.996
of preventing, hopefully,
or prosecuting and winning wars,

01:05:32.997 --> 01:05:36.833
and war is a destructive
human activity.

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.369
Militaries are not
gonna solve this for us.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:42.339
An armored division is not
gonna defeat climate change.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:47.011
You don't wanna turn
to your military

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:49.646
to solve what are really
civil society problems.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:53.050
That's a dangerous game.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:57.154
They do need to understand
how it all fits together,

01:05:57.254 --> 01:06:00.590
because that's gonna affect
what they need to be ready for,

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:05.129
but that doesn't mean
it's their mission to fix it.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.414
What keeps me up at night

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:28.385
is the possibility
that we'll have a world

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.288
where the risks associated
with climate change

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:35.959
are so dire and so
potentially unmanageable

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:39.196
that governments
start acting in ways

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.731
that are authoritarian.

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:49.073
That's a world
that I don't wanna live in.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:53.277
That's a world I don't want
my children to live in.

01:06:53.377 --> 01:06:56.213
And it's a world
that we see in these scenarios

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:59.349
that the United States
military produces.

01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:08.125
We're at war with the most
dangerous enemy

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.526
that has ever faced mankind

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.096
in his long climb
from the swamp to the stars,

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:14.364
and it's been said
if we lose that war

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:17.234
and in so doing lose
this way of freedom of ours,

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.436
history will record
with the greatest astonishment

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.338
that those
who had the most to lose

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:23.707
did the least
to prevent its happening.

01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:31.215
We spent billions of dollars
of our GDP during the cold war

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:35.185
to reduce the threat
of nuclear attack,

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:40.157
which is low probability
but very high consequence.

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:44.694
Now we face risks
from climate change

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:49.199
that are arguably as severe
and of higher probability,

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.670
and yet there is
in some quarters

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.306
a reluctance to face up
to the challenges

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.542
and build a resilient society.

01:08:01.245 --> 01:08:03.347
Whether it's threats
from nuclear weapons

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:05.349
or international
terrorist organizations,

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:08.585
any percentage is unacceptable.

01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:13.690
When you think
about climate change

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.392
as a risk-management issue,

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:18.728
then all of the actions
we need to take

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.198
are going to be on the table.

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:24.834
If we don't, then we're
going to have to make

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.537
some very, very
difficult choices.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.211
Where can we make ourselves
more resilient?

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.380
Where can we make ourselves
more prepared?

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.015
Where can we act now
in order to mitigate

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:40.584
the consequences of decisions

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:42.618
that were made since
the industrial revolution?

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.830
There's a difficult truth
we've gotta face here.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:57.567
As we've seen rising
awareness of the problem,

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:01.671
we've continued to accelerate
our contribution.

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:09.746
Reversing that may be

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.747
the most difficult
collective-action problem

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:13.716
we've ever faced.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.055
I do think the biggest threat
is climate change

01:09:19.223 --> 01:09:21.591
and its national
security aspects.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:25.729
Our problem is that not everything
can be handled militarily,

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:29.233
and that we also have
a short attention span.

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:32.502
These are very
long-term problems.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:35.305
This is a whole
of society issue.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:39.243
We have to address it
in all of our institutions.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:42.612
That means
all aspects of government.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:46.149
It means the resources
and the political will.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.518
It is a matter of cooperating,

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:49.953
and if you look at these issues,

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:52.356
it will require
American leadership

01:09:52.456 --> 01:09:56.260
within a system that other
countries play a part in.

01:09:58.462 --> 01:09:59.896
We have to lead.

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:01.398
The industrialized countries,

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:02.899
we're the ones who are doing

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:05.101
the vast majority of
the polluting here in the world.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.770
We gotta step up to this.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:10.574
Every aspect of national
security is about managing risk.

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.242
Our politicians in my opinion

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:13.777
should take a lesson
from the military.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:17.614
They should start prudent
action to reduce emissions.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:20.750
Congress won't lead
on this issue,

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.453
but they can be led.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.291
That's why I continue to go
around and talk about this issue.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:32.095
We need to find policy solutions

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:35.865
that can deal with it.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.768
One of the things that I find
personally really distressing,

01:10:38.868 --> 01:10:41.338
having worked
for Republicans and democrats,

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:44.341
is that something that should be
a point of convergence

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:46.376
has become so divisive.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:48.612
This polarization has allowed us

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:52.749
to not really address
what we really need to do.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:56.453
Resilience and improving
our ability to respond,

01:10:56.553 --> 01:10:59.656
those are the least
that we should be doing.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:02.992
That's, in military parlance,
the first line of defense.

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:10.334
One of the first things
they ever taught me

01:11:10.434 --> 01:11:11.668
as a combat leader

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.337
was choosing to do nothing
is a choice.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:15.238
Inaction is as much
of a decision

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:16.440
as any other course of action,

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.975
and it carries
those consequences.

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.757
It's a very dangerous thing

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:37.861
to decide that there is one
and only one line of events

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.496
heading into the future

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:43.633
and one and only one best
response for dealing with that.

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:50.707
When systems become invested
in an old way of thinking,

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:54.511
there is a moment
when those structures

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.446
start to break down.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:59.215
The system resists
the idea of change

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:00.684
to a certain point,

01:12:00.784 --> 01:12:03.286
and then the weight
of collective experience

01:12:03.387 --> 01:12:05.522
says "something's
not working here."

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:07.090
We need a change."

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:13.296
I don't think you get
to that moment by slow degrees.

01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:17.667
I think it occurs
like an avalanche.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:20.203
And there comes a moment
when you have to know

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:22.772
when to change course.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.712
Even as we spend
all of our time talking

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:31.981
about what humans are capable
of doing in a negative sense,

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:34.217
we don't know the limits
of what we're capable of doing

01:12:34.418 --> 01:12:35.452
in a positive sense.

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:39.523
We haven't found that either.

01:12:39.623 --> 01:12:41.758
The general drift
is in the wrong direction.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.828
We have an awful lot of things
that we should be afraid of.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:47.096
The window of action is closing.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.566
But there wouldn't be any point
talking about all of this

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:51.468
if we didn't have
the knowledge which we do,

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:53.002
if we didn't have
the tools which we do,

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.472
and if we didn't have
unpredictable potential,

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:58.107
which we also do.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.977
What people need
more than a fright

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:05.148
is some credible description
of a way out of the problem.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.924
Energy independence
fundamentally

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:17.360
is about the ability
to meet our energy needs

01:13:17.461 --> 01:13:21.465
from within our own borders
indefinitely.

01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:25.101
There's no more
American concept than that,

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:28.104
and that means taking control
of our energy future

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:31.641
and investing in alternatives
to our current system.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.816
The flip side
of the climate threat

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:43.186
is the energy
and resilience opportunity.

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:49.893
The more diversified we are
in our energy sources,

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:52.095
from a whole array of renewables

01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:54.030
to innovative technologies,

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.666
the sounder and stronger
and more secure we will be.

01:13:59.503 --> 01:14:00.537
One of the things we've seen

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:02.506
is a whole generation
of veterans

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:04.708
who have come back
from the conflicts

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:06.375
in Iraq and Afghanistan

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.513
with a very deep, personal
understanding of this challenge.

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:13.950
We've seen returning veterans

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.919
go into the renewable
energy industry,

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:20.757
installing solar panels
and starting companies.

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:23.527
They see not only
the technology of the future,

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:25.529
but they also see a mission.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:28.532
They see a continuation
of public service

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:29.899
that drove them
to raise their hand

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.168
and volunteer to put on
the uniform in the first place.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:39.208
We did not end the Stone age
because we ran out of stones.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.677
We found something better.

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:45.214
Winston Churchill
is alleged to have said

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:48.852
that Americans can always be
counted on to do the right thing

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.888
after exhausting
every other possibility.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.558
We're getting towards
the end of exhausting

01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:57.060
all those other possibilities.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.795
The response to climate change

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:03.667
involves a type
of industrial revolution.

01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:07.737
We need to leave behind
the technologies

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.138
based on fossil fuels

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:13.577
and shift towards
a clean-tech renaissance.

01:15:14.578 --> 01:15:18.481
The path forward already exists.

01:15:18.582 --> 01:15:22.586
If you look at the rate at which
the technology is improving,

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:27.456
this actually
is an economic boon.

01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:29.258
Doing what we should proactively

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:30.594
to deal with climate change

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.629
becomes part of the solution set

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:34.163
to what we should
be doing proactively

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:36.866
to deal with the economic
strength of the country.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.671
These are the plays
that are gonna define

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.473
the 21st century either way.

01:15:44.608 --> 01:15:47.276
We'll improve our security and
we'll improve our way of life.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.245
We'll improve our economy.

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:52.081
We may also head off one
of the largest risks we face.

01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:55.318
The most important thing
is for people to see

01:15:55.418 --> 01:16:00.189
how actually tangible and, like,
within possible grasp

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:03.026
this change is.

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:53.342
I don't think that humanity
is guaranteed a pass

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:57.013
out of the problems that
it is creating for itself.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:05.221
If we fail, then it is possible
that we can never again,

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:08.557
at any price,
obtain the kind of future

01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:12.128
that we may be able to secure
for ourselves if we succeed.

01:17:17.701 --> 01:17:21.705
The technological means
are in hand.

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:24.974
The wealth exists.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:27.276
The question always is
is whether or not

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:30.046
the wisdom exists.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:46.062
In any strategic system,

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:49.332
time is the most
precious resource.

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:55.805
It's the one thing
that cannot be replenished.
