00:01.101 --> 00:02.159
Previously on The O.C. :

00:02.335 --> 00:05.702
It took the investigators six months
to find Volchok.

00:05.872 --> 00:09.706
-Ryan, this may be the only chance we get.
-He's not gonna get away.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.339
Did you kill him?
That was the plan, right? The real plan?

00:13.513 --> 00:15.003
Taylor, you got married.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.411
I am now Madame Taylor Townsend
de Montmorand.

00:17.584 --> 00:20.280
I can't have you running around
like Miss Clockwork Orange.

00:20.453 --> 00:23.752
Do you really think that Dr. Roberts
is at that conference by himself?

00:23.923 --> 00:26.892
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I needed somebody to talk to.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.392
Talk to Seth.
Tell him what you're going through.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.120
You came here with this secret...

00:31.297 --> 00:33.993
...but you've spent the whole time
telling me what's wrong.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.862
You're the one avoiding, avoider.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.560
You still thinking about Marissa.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.034
I mean, you cheated on her.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.173
You're gonna
convince her to go to Mexico?

00:41.341 --> 00:43.400
Let my dad help.
You didn't mean to kill her.

00:43.576 --> 00:44.941
You can't keep running.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.511
-Seth set me up.
-He called. He was worried.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.343
After everything our families have been
through, you put our kids in danger.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.509
At least you still have all your kids.

00:53.686 --> 00:55.085
You did the right thing, Seth.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.519
You mean betraying my friend
by ratting him out?

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:16.209 --> 01:20.077
-He hasn't spoken to us in days.
-Well, us he can ignore.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.646
When Ryan doesn't speak to Seth,
that's when I worry.

01:22.816 --> 01:27.014
-It's like he's turning into an island.
-Right in the path of Hurricane Julie.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.553
Since we got back,
things haven't been the same.

01:29.722 --> 01:34.182
Tell me about it.
I've been banned from your house.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.921
-Your parents have been mad at me before.
-It's never been this bad.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.995
We're excluding her from Thanksgiving.

01:41.668 --> 01:45.331
When you send our kids on a murder
mission, you get knocked off the list.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.439
House rules.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.098
Hey, I was just calling
to say happy Thanksgiving.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.645
Well, I use the term "happy" loosely.

01:53.813 --> 01:58.045
It's actually shaping up
to be kind of an awkward Thanksgiving.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.446
Filled with silence....

02:17.637 --> 02:20.162
Thing is, Ryan and l
have never been in a fight before.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.332
But I got a feeling
things will blow over today.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.809
Because they have to. It's Thanksgiving.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.040
It's Thanksgiving.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.050
You just watch. This family's
gonna come together for the holidays.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.653
That's what we Cohens do.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.052
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.828
-Coffee?
-Sure.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.567
Should be ready any second.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.643
I hate to miss this spirited discussion,
but I gotta take this.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.579
Hello?

03:16.329 --> 03:18.092
Where are you?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.605
Okay, enough of this.
No more tiptoeing, no more silences.

03:27.774 --> 03:31.608
It is Thanksgiving and this family is gonna
get over what happened and move on.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.178
-I don't know if it's that easy.
-No one said it was.

03:34.347 --> 03:38.010
But this family is gonna work together
and make Thanksgiving dinner.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.744
You two. Grocery store. Together.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.288
-I've gotta pick up Summer.
-You can go before.

03:45.458 --> 03:50.486
List. Here. And when you get back,
we're gonna cook this bird together.

03:50.663 --> 03:53.029
Including you. No surfing, no golf.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.531
-You got it. I do have to go to the office.
-Sandy.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.398
I'll only be gone a few hours
and when I'm back, I'm yours.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.732
Great.
Now you can all change and wash up.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.876
But you report for duty in one hour.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.712
Ryan, are you gonna be okay?

04:07.880 --> 04:11.316
Because if you can't put your anger
about Volchok aside, even for today...

04:11.484 --> 04:14.920
-...then there's no point to any of this.
-No, I'm not angry.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.452
I just wish he was dead.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.489
It's me.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.167
-Are you still there?
-Yeah.

04:33.873 --> 04:34.931
I'm here.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.934
Thanks for coming.

05:36.402 --> 05:39.894
To be honest with you,
I didn't know where else to go.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.304
Hitched a ride into town.
Slept on the beach last night--

05:43.476 --> 05:46.240
I'm not your friend. I'm your lawyer.

05:46.412 --> 05:51.008
And I'll help you get through this.
But the less you talk, the better.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.679
All right?

05:59.759 --> 06:02.887
-I brought you a bagel.
-A bagel?

06:03.062 --> 06:05.189
I asked for an egg-white omelet
and cantaloupe.

06:05.365 --> 06:09.233
I said you could hide out in my room.
I did not say there will be room service.

06:09.402 --> 06:13.566
Seth. One day when I'm no longer sleeping
under your bed, you're gonna miss me.

06:14.073 --> 06:18.066
And when will that be? Because you made it
sound like this was a temporary thing.

06:18.244 --> 06:21.213
I know. I know.
You think it would be healthier for me...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.611
...to confront my fear and face my mom.

06:23.783 --> 06:27.378
More like Summer's coming home, and
I was hoping we could get it on up here.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.145
-You understand.
-Right. Of course.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.119
You guys need alone time together.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.850
Like you said, your relationship
is hanging by a thread.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.756
-I didn't say that.
-Really?

06:36.929 --> 06:38.556
You didn't?

06:40.666 --> 06:44.432
I must've dreamt it. Since I've been
on the run, my dreams have been so vivid.

06:44.604 --> 06:47.004
Last night, I dreamed
that Gerard Depardieu and l...

06:47.173 --> 06:49.403
-...were teammates on The Amazing Race.
-Back up.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.736
Is this about your trip to Brown
last week?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.379
Did something happen with Summer?

06:54.547 --> 06:57.983
No, of course not.
No, she's still the same old Summer.

06:58.384 --> 07:03.447
She might not smell like the same old
Summer, but inside she's still the same girl.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.054
I wouldn't know.
I feel like we've barely spoken in weeks.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.129
Seth, you guys are gonna be fine.

07:12.298 --> 07:15.062
Just think,
she's on her way here right now.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.661
-I don't think I'm coming.
-I've been looking forward to seeing you.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.104
I just got back.
I've got a lot to tell you.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.608
-Well, tell me now.
-No, I want you here.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.370
-It's Thanksgiving.
-Exactly.

07:27.547 --> 07:31.313
Millions of turkeys being slaughtered
so us Americans can get even fatter.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.952
-I like turkey.
-I know you do.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.611
I just--
I don't think I can support this holiday.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.281
-I think I'm gonna to sit this one out.
-You wanna tell me what's going on?

07:41.527 --> 07:44.155
I don't know. I'm just not up for it.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.924
-ls that a dog?
-Hold on a second.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.135
Kaitlin, what is that thing
doing in my house?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.606
Well, nothing now.

07:57.777 --> 08:01.008
Although a few minutes ago,
she kind of took a tinkle in your den.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.978
Get that thing out of here.
Take it back wherever you got it.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.618
I found her at the pier.
And I'm not taking her back.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.515
I mean, she totally fits in my purse.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.849
Does your mother know
that you have this thing?

08:11.023 --> 08:14.686
Well, yesterday
she almost sucked her up in the vacuum.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.520
I guess to her the dog is invisible.
Like me.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.868
Oh, by the way,
I think your Varvatos are cashed.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.029
You're sorry?

08:27.707 --> 08:30.005
This was a $700 dollar pair of shoes.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.871
Oh, I forgot to ask you.
How'd your conference go?

08:40.219 --> 08:43.017
-Thought so.
-Sorry about that, sweetheart.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.181
It's all right.
Dad, it sounds like you're in the loony bin.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.190
Sometimes I think I am.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.558
You need me there, don't you?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.893
-Desperately.
-All right. I'll see you in six hours.

08:54.066 --> 08:58.469
-Love you.
-You too. Bye. Crap.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.198
I know it's Thanksgiving.
You're a private investigator.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.399
Can't you find a guy and eat turkey?

09:03.576 --> 09:06.010
-Julie.
-Call me back in five, will you?

09:06.178 --> 09:09.670
-Hi. Sorry. Do you want a waffle?
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.076
I've been trying to talk to you
ever since I got back from my trip.

09:13.252 --> 09:17.279
Why don't we spend the morning together?
We can go for a walk on the beach.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.617
Maybe without our cell phones.

09:19.792 --> 09:23.125
-No. I'm sorry. I have to cook.
-Cook? We were going to the Cohens'.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.526
Well, we're not.
Kirsten's turkey is always dry.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.825
And Sandy with his speeches
about family...

09:28.000 --> 09:29.228
...I'd just as soon eat in.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.564
-Nothing in there.
-Then I'll go to the market.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.866
Can I have my cell phone, please?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.347
Thank you.

09:45.318 --> 09:49.778
-We're gonna have to talk eventually.
-Yeah, yeah. After the holidays, of course.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.254
So what's next?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.329
Parsley.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.834
Wow, this trip to the grocery store
has been a real success.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.802
I'm sure silent cart-pushing is what my mom
envisioned when she sent us here.

10:06.973 --> 10:10.465
What do you expect? Me to get over
everything because we're buying parsley?

10:10.643 --> 10:12.110
It's more than a garnish, Ryan.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.802
-It's a good omen.
-Yeah.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.742
Speaking of omens.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.415
-Julie.
-Ryan.

10:19.585 --> 10:22.452
Hello, Julie, I wanted to thank you
for that travel tip.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.490
Ensenada turned out to be
the perfect vacation spot for the Cohens.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.627
-We may get a time-share.
-Save it, Seth.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.989
I already got the lecture from your dad.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.599
Ryan, would you care to join me
in the samples?

10:35.034 --> 10:36.729
I'll get the sweet potatoes.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.893
We've got two types of Gouda.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.299
This is the Beemster.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.270
And this is the Old Amsterdam.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.270
It's delicious.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.410
So the Pl swears he'll have a location
for Volchok by Monday.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.517
-What do we do until then?
-Just wait, I guess.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.518
I'll call you. We'll make a plan.
Until then, act normal.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.613
Thank you.

10:57.790 --> 11:02.193
Hey, Sandy, I was just wondering when
you were gonna be home to help me with....

11:02.361 --> 11:03.953
Oh, my God.

11:04.897 --> 11:08.389
-Taylor, I thought you were in France.
-I am. I was.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.229
In fact, what am I doing here
when Gay Paree beckons?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.201
-Au revoir.
-Hold on.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.665
When a kid is stealing stuffing
in my kitchen...

11:17.843 --> 11:19.811
...that's usually a sign
something's wrong.

11:21.313 --> 11:25.181
I would talk to you, Mrs. Cohen,
but this is simply too private.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.313
I'll make you a plate of food.

11:28.487 --> 11:29.749
Living room?

11:31.290 --> 11:33.622
The only important thing
is Sandy can't suspect us.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.261
He needs to feel like we've
moved on, we've let go.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.897
Yeah, well, that's gonna be kind of hard.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.498
He knows I haven't given up on Volchok.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.931
I kind of got into it this morning.

11:44.103 --> 11:48.699
Then you need to go smooth things over.
Smile, apologize, lie, whatever it takes.

11:49.141 --> 11:52.975
Ryan, you wanna get this son of a bitch
just as badly as I do.

11:53.145 --> 11:56.672
That's a really hard thing to do with
Sandy Cohen watching your every move.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.750
All right.
I'll stop by his office on my way back.

12:01.921 --> 12:04.822
Oh, Ryan? One more thing.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.787
Do you know how to cook a turkey?

12:09.028 --> 12:10.552
Never mind.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.890
You got married?

12:12.064 --> 12:16.626
His name was Henri-Michel
and I met him outside the Place des Vosges.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.896
He wooed me for a few whirlwind weeks,
and the next thing I knew...

12:20.072 --> 12:22.267
...I was in his family's chapel
in Burgundy...

12:22.441 --> 12:26.571
...tipsy off a 1 953 Château Margaux, and
vowing to love him until death do us part.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.807
I can't believe this is happening.
Taylor, you're usually so responsible.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.217
Well, needless to say, it was une erreur.

12:33.619 --> 12:37.214
Now he won't agree to an annulment.
He is a stubborn man.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.482
Sexy. And well-endowed.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.326
But stubborn.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.759
So I came home
and I'm just too afraid to tell my mom now.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.091
I've known your mom for a long time.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.234
She might be tough, but she's your mom.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.494
Which means that she loves you
no matter what.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.161
That's so sweet and totally wrong.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.366
-You think you're underestimating her?
-No.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.376
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I just had the best idea.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.912
You could tell her.
Now that we're like sisters--

13:03.082 --> 13:04.982
No, that's your job.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.957
Okay. I will talk to her,
but I am not doing your dirty work.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.028
-I'll just put her in the right frame of mind.
-That's great.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.927
She's in charge of the Turkey Trot.
At the Yacht Club?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.261
-She'll be there all afternoon.
-I can't today.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.596
I have a thousand things to do, Taylor.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.599
Okay, fine. I will talk to her today.
But you're gonna have to help me cook.

13:31.777 --> 13:35.304
Oh, Kirsten,
I will be the best sous-chef ever.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.411
You just watch.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.223
-Hey.
-Hi.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.860
Hi.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.991
Here, I sprung for roses.

13:57.403 --> 14:01.032
The cheapskate in me wanted to get you
carnations, but it's a special occasion.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.402
-lt is?
-Yeah. You're here.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.773
Not just for a whirlwind comic book
intervention, for an actual visit.

14:06.946 --> 14:11.076
-Well, it's only for three nights.
-It's longer than you think.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.277
Thanks, Greg.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.818
So I'm gonna go see the DA,
enter your guilty plea...

14:22.995 --> 14:25.555
...and we can settle on a charge
and sentence tonight.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.221
So I'll still be doing time.

14:28.067 --> 14:31.161
For what you did? Yeah. I'd say so.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.862
That Seth kid said....

14:34.039 --> 14:36.837
-He said that you would help me.
-I am helping you.

14:37.009 --> 14:40.376
Helping turn you over so you can get
the punishment you deserve.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.245
You made a lot of mistakes.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.612
But you turned yourself in
and that was the right thing to do.

14:46.785 --> 14:51.848
After a while, being in Mexico
and running all the time...

14:52.024 --> 14:53.889
...it started to feel like
prison anyway.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.323
That's guilt for you.

14:56.495 --> 14:57.553
Follows you around.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.294
But you're here now.

15:02.468 --> 15:06.564
So we'll find a hotel room for you
while I work things out with Hoades.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.333
I really appreciate this.

15:09.508 --> 15:13.842
Well, the sooner you're off the street,
the sooner Ryan can start his life again.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.578
-Yeah, I just want it all to be over.
-Oh, me too.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.582
You have no idea.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.029
You know
where Sandy Cohen's office is?

15:31.196 --> 15:33.460
Yeah, it's inside to the left.
But you missed him.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.224
-I did?
-He just left with a client.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.096
Poor guy's working on Thanksgiving.

15:52.184 --> 15:55.244
No. No, no, no. Kirsten, here. Let me.

15:55.421 --> 15:58.652
You wanna just lightly kiss the bird.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.348
-Like so.
-I see.

16:01.193 --> 16:02.956
Hey, did you know Taylor
was in town?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.586
Hello, Ryan. I know, you must be confused
as to why I'm here, but in time--

16:06.765 --> 16:08.926
-Do you know where Sandy is?
-He called.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.966
-He had errands to run.
-He say where?

16:11.704 --> 16:13.968
-No. Is everything okay?
-It's fine. I'll be back.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.368
I was hoping you'd help with dinner.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.443
Okay, but only for a while.
My dad needs me back in crazytown.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.512
Wanted you to witness the magic
of a Cohen family Thanksgiving.

16:22.681 --> 16:24.672
-Even if only for a few moments.
-All right.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.717
-Hey, Ryan, look who showed up.
-Hey, Atwood.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.945
See, there's magic everywhere.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.857
-Gourds. It needs gourds.
-Hi, guys.

16:35.427 --> 16:39.295
-Hi, Summer. It's good to see you.
-You too.

16:39.465 --> 16:43.663
Welcome home. Did you bathe in a creek?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.634
-Taylor, what are you doing out?
-I came clean to your mom.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.670
Now I'm helping her
throw Thanksgiving.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.473
Taylor, now that Seth and Summer are here
we'll go talk to your mother.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.172
Taking on Veronica Townsend?
That's a death wish.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.375
Why don't you just baste the turkey?

17:01.420 --> 17:04.719
But just very lightly
with the little brush thing and not--

17:04.890 --> 17:07.154
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.186
Gosh, I haven't been in this house
in so long.

17:13.365 --> 17:19.497
Well, the house misses you. So do l.
In fact, upstairs has been asking for you.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.229
Oh, really?

17:21.406 --> 17:24.898
-Well, I gotta get back to my dad's house.
-Give me five minutes.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.635
Promise?

17:27.746 --> 17:29.680
Keep me honest.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.680
Ten.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.287
How's dinner coming?

17:39.458 --> 17:42.916
Fantastic. You wouldn't happen to know
how to cook a turkey, would you?

17:43.095 --> 17:45.757
-You've never cooked a turkey?
-Well, Jimmy always did it.

17:45.931 --> 17:49.094
And after we broke up,
then we ended up at the Cohens.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.600
Right, and the reason
we're not going there is?

17:52.871 --> 17:54.805
Get that, will you?

18:08.187 --> 18:09.552
-Hey, Ryan.
-ls Julie home?

18:09.721 --> 18:13.487
-She is, but I'd rather you didn't bother her.
-I just need a minute of her time.

18:13.659 --> 18:17.288
I've been saying the same thing for six
months. You can talk after the holiday.

18:17.463 --> 18:20.626
I don't think you really understand
what's going on here.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.926
No, you're right, I don't.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.229
I don't understand all the phone calls...

18:25.404 --> 18:28.066
...why we're not having dinner
with your family tonight.

18:28.907 --> 18:32.172
All I know is, I was once very excited
about my life with this woman...

18:32.344 --> 18:34.175
...and it all seems to be disappearing.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.941
I get it. I'm sorry.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.084
Tell your family
I say happy Thanksgiving.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.092
I said burgundy candles, not orange.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.492
Now, you go get them or I'll send
a 91 1 page to my guy at the lNS.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.257
Okay. Off you go.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.494
-You sure you don't wanna come with me?
-No.

18:58.670 --> 19:02.299
My stomach's kind of doing that
flip-floppy thing it does every time I see her.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.647
Kirsten Cohen, what a surprise.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.784
Have you been doing Pilates? You look thin.
And I love your hair.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.943
Thanks, Veronica.
Actually, I just came by to help.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.554
You can help with the candles.

19:22.361 --> 19:25.228
So this is your first holiday
without Taylor.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.388
-That must be hard for you.
-lt is.

19:27.566 --> 19:31.263
You know,
I tell my clients that I'm a mother first.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.631
And a sports agent second.

19:35.641 --> 19:39.441
Could you make those
a little bit more parallel? Like....

19:39.611 --> 19:42.580
No, just-- Maybe I should just do it.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.149
I feel the same way about being a mom.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.115
You love your children no matter what.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.256
-Even if they disappoint you.
-Of course, and you would know.

19:51.423 --> 19:55.484
With the shooting and the car accident
and Seth burning down the Newport Group--

19:55.661 --> 19:57.891
Actually, I was talking about you
and Taylor.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.093
Right. And I love Taylor unconditionally.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.524
You know, a wise woman once said:

20:03.702 --> 20:07.194
"lf you love until it hurts, there can be
no more hurt, but only more love."

20:07.372 --> 20:09.567
You know who said that? The mother.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.902
Mother Teresa.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.907
Oh, my God, Taylor.
What are you doing here?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.414
Hi, Mom, I need to talk to you.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.176
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.380
You'll be fine.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.396
We only have a few minutes.
You have to do yoga?

20:34.566 --> 20:38.058
I've been on a plane all day.
I'm trying to reverse the blood flow.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.867
Fresh oxygen to the brain
gives you clarity and peace of mind.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.271
I can't believe
you had no reaction to my tattoo.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.309
I told you to get that thing removed.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.538
Yeah, I'll get it removed.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.811
-Did it hurt?
-Whatever.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.317
I was with my Marine buds.
I barely felt a thing.

20:55.487 --> 20:58.615
-I bet you cried.
-Like a baby. Glad you're home.

20:59.391 --> 21:00.619
Me too.

21:13.572 --> 21:16.336
-What's wrong?
-I just-- I get upset when I think about...

21:18.944 --> 21:21.879
...all of the food that an American
consumes during Thanksgiving...

21:22.047 --> 21:24.743
...when so many people go without.
We need to do something.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.907
-We gotta go. Gotta go somewhere.
-Go where?

21:27.085 --> 21:29.246
The soup kitchen.
We're gonna feed the homeless.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.981
Do we have to? We're feeding Ryan,
he was homeless once.

21:32.157 --> 21:34.819
-Hey, you can go or you can stay.
-Summer, how you doing?

21:34.993 --> 21:37.427
Better than the 2.8 billion
below the poverty level.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.622
Are you okay with that statistic?
I don't think so. I have to go.

21:42.801 --> 21:46.328
Who knew, out of all you kids, she'd
turn out to be the young Sandy Cohen?

21:46.505 --> 21:48.336
Had to rub off on someone.
Be back soon.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.508
Hey. Honey.

21:56.682 --> 21:59.082
I thought we were gonna be
having dinner as a family.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.412
Here I am being driven crazy
by Taylor Townsend.

22:01.586 --> 22:04.020
I got news.
Volchok came to see me today.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.089
-"Volchok" Volchok?
-He turned himself in.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.522
I put him in a hotel
while Hoades finishes.

22:08.694 --> 22:12.289
-I figure we'll tell Ryan after the holiday.
-After he's already in jail.

22:12.464 --> 22:15.297
-So he can't get at him.
-Yeah, the thought did cross my mind.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.027
Don't bother asking where he is,
I'm not gonna tell you.

22:18.203 --> 22:20.671
Look, you stopped me
from going after him, that I get.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.069
-But to defend him?
-I'm not defending him, Ryan.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.539
I'm negotiating
the terms of his surrender.

22:25.711 --> 22:27.736
He's gonna get every bit
of what he deserves.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.508
Ryan, Sandy and I would only do
what's best for you.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.316
-You wanna do what's in my best interest?
-Always.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.583
Leave me alone.

22:37.155 --> 22:38.918
Ryan.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.480
Come on, wait.

22:56.174 --> 22:59.507
-Hi. You're friends with Volchok, right?
-Used to be.

23:00.312 --> 23:03.338
No one's seen Volchok for months.
Don't know where he is.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.779
He's back.
I need to find out where he's staying.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.111
I don't know.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.776
-lf he called, it would be Heather.
-Got her number?

23:09.955 --> 23:13.288
-Haven't talked. Might not be in town.
-I'm gonna need that number.

23:31.109 --> 23:32.337
Hey.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.205
-Just for the record, that night--
-I don't wanna talk about it.

23:36.415 --> 23:40.010
Look, at the first stop light,
I jumped out and I tried to find help...

23:40.185 --> 23:42.380
...and when I got back,
Volchok was gone.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.090
-Just needed you to know that.
-I just need to find the guy.

23:49.027 --> 23:51.587
Like I told you on the phone,
I don't know where he is.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.492
Must've called,
told you he was back.

23:53.665 --> 23:56.225
He thinks that I'm gone too. And I was.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.869
I'm only home to see my mom
for Thanksgiving.

23:59.037 --> 24:02.336
-I shouldn't even be talking to you--
-I'm not gonna call the cops.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.244
You know, I spoke to him a few of months
after the accident...

24:06.411 --> 24:09.073
...and he sounded pretty messed up.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.143
Good. Thanks for meeting me.

24:12.317 --> 24:17.550
Look, maybe you should try
to put it behind you.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.019
Just let him go.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.282
Good advice.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.301
-Hello?
-Any luck?

24:30.469 --> 24:34.166
No. I've been to the Bait Shop, the diner.
Can't find him anywhere.

24:34.372 --> 24:37.239
I just feel strange to be cooking
with all this going on.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.742
-Maybe we should call dinner off.
-No, keep it going.

24:40.912 --> 24:44.871
-I got another idea where he might be.
-Call me as soon as you--

24:45.050 --> 24:47.018
I gotta go.

24:48.920 --> 24:53.619
-What happened?
-She called me irresponsible and stupid.

24:53.792 --> 24:58.855
Then she said I would never be truly thin
because I have a naturally large thorax.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.827
Oh, Taylor. That's awful.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.627
And the worst part is-- Oh, my God.

25:03.802 --> 25:06.669
These are like cardboard.
You're gonna wanna add some cream.

25:06.838 --> 25:11.935
You know, the worst part is, she said
I'm no longer welcome in her house.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.044
I am le vagabond.

25:15.714 --> 25:18.308
-You can stay here.
-Forever?

25:18.750 --> 25:23.949
Well, no, for one night.
But we'll find somewhere for you to stay.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.822
Thank you, Kiki.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.794
And I am so sorry
that after all you've done for me...

25:30.962 --> 25:34.329
...I abandoned ship during
the crucial hour before Thanksgiving.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.234
Now, let's see
how you're doing with those pies.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.836
Did you smash the pecans finely
like I told you to?

25:41.006 --> 25:43.907
-I skipped the pecan pie.
-You skipped the pecan?

25:44.075 --> 25:47.533
Well, one pumpkin will be fine.
There's only five of us.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.304
You may wanna rethink that.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.582
We invited over some friends.
Love the Cohen open-door policy.

25:55.687 --> 25:56.779
These aren't friends.

25:56.955 --> 26:01.119
We were trying to help out at the soup
kitchen and they had enough volunteers.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.592
Like such a thing exists.
Just follow me to the family room.

26:06.998 --> 26:10.525
-I really need to use your toilet.
-It's the first one on the left.

26:11.136 --> 26:12.535
Take these matches.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.267
-I'm next.
-All right. You're next.

26:16.441 --> 26:18.170
Sorry.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.773
-They can't stay.
-I can't tell them to go.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.919
Summer will have a nervous breakdown.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.487
You know, I used to volunteer at the Y,
teaching personal hygiene.

26:31.656 --> 26:35.422
I could run through the basics.
That means I wouldn't be able to help here.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.323
-Really? That sounds great.
-Okay.

26:37.495 --> 26:40.953
They stay, you keep them in one place,
you keep them occupied.

26:41.499 --> 26:42.898
Okay....

26:43.068 --> 26:48.665
Who here has not seen
Battlestar Galactica season one?

26:48.840 --> 26:50.637
I missed the season finale.

26:50.809 --> 26:54.176
-Get ready to have your mind....
-Don't worry, Kiki. I got your back.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.445
-Julie.
-I thought you weren't speaking to me.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.087
I'm not calling to make peace.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.154
-I'm looking for Ryan.
-Ryan?

27:05.323 --> 27:08.190
-You told me to stay away from him.
-Oh, come on.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.261
He called you as soon as he found out
I had Volchok in custody.

27:14.332 --> 27:15.697
Volchok is in custody?

27:16.935 --> 27:18.368
So you really didn't know, huh?

27:19.204 --> 27:23.163
-No. No, I didn't.
-He turned himself in this morning.

27:23.341 --> 27:26.777
I already spoke to the DA.
It should be a done deal by tonight.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.446
So it's really over.

27:30.615 --> 27:32.207
I sure as hell hope so.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.676
Julie?

27:37.555 --> 27:39.216
Julie.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.460
Mom, are you okay?

27:46.631 --> 27:48.360
I don't know.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.860
Well, do you wanna lie down
or something?

27:54.372 --> 27:57.136
Lay in the dark with nothing
but my thoughts to distract me?

27:57.308 --> 27:59.367
No, Kaitlin, that is not what I wanna do.

28:01.212 --> 28:04.909
Okay. Never mind.
I'll just go find my dog.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.980
She's having a meltdown. Good luck.

28:12.724 --> 28:16.057
-Julie, you look pale. Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

28:16.227 --> 28:19.924
I have a turkey to cook, potatoes to mash,
and that's all I have to think about.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.828
Just think about the task at hand.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.561
Will you get out? You're in the way.
I have to baste.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.700
Nobody registered by that name.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.847
Close. But he's not here.

28:37.615 --> 28:40.277
-So I'll keep looking.
-Why don't you come with me?

28:40.452 --> 28:42.579
So you can give me one of your lectures?

28:42.754 --> 28:44.016
Oh, we're beyond all that.

28:44.889 --> 28:49.952
-All right. So what are you doing here?
-Why don't you find out? Come on.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.865
There aren't enough chairs.
Darryl needs one.

28:59.037 --> 29:00.971
Summer, can we talk--?

29:01.139 --> 29:02.128
Hey. Yeah.

29:02.307 --> 29:04.605
I'm gonna make a seating area
out of cushions.

29:04.776 --> 29:05.868
Summer, we need to talk.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.945
I can't talk, I have to mash these potatoes.
Hand me the cream.

29:09.114 --> 29:12.811
No. No more distraction tactics.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.713
You and I both know
what's going on.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.087
These are ruined.
I'm going to the store.

29:21.159 --> 29:22.717
You have any baking soda?

29:22.894 --> 29:26.887
Get that dog out of my house right now, or
so help me God, I will have it put to sleep.

29:27.065 --> 29:30.296
God. You would, wouldn't you?

29:32.237 --> 29:35.172
-Kaitlin, where are you going?
-To the Cohens.

29:35.340 --> 29:38.138
They don't hate the whole family, Mom.
Just you.

29:38.309 --> 29:42.040
Fine. Don't come crying to me
when Kirsten's turkey tastes like rubber.

29:42.981 --> 29:46.144
Julie. Julie.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.185
Julie. Listen to me.

29:49.687 --> 29:52.212
Listen to me.
I love you but you are acting insane.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.484
I am not insane, okay?
What's insane is how I used to be.

29:55.660 --> 29:59.118
When all I would do was hang out
with my best friend and go tanning...

29:59.297 --> 30:02.198
...and go shopping and braid her hair
and talk on the phone--

30:02.367 --> 30:05.200
Summer, stop. Let's be honest.
That's what this is all about.

30:05.370 --> 30:08.806
Marissa, it's all about her.
Stop running away and let yourself grieve.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.032
-My keys.
-Stop running away from me.

30:11.209 --> 30:12.198
I'm not running away.

30:12.377 --> 30:15.175
I didn't realize how late it was.
My dad's probably freaking.

30:15.346 --> 30:17.337
I'm sorry I said it. Just, please don't go.

30:17.515 --> 30:21.042
You're the one who walked away, Neil.
You had the affair, remember?

30:22.554 --> 30:25.887
Nothing happened with Gloria.
I told you, I needed somebody to talk to.

30:26.057 --> 30:28.048
Well, you can talk to her
all you want now.

30:28.226 --> 30:29.955
When I get back, I want you out.

30:30.628 --> 30:35.531
-It's my house.
-We'll see about that. Bye, Neil.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.964
Bye.

30:51.616 --> 30:52.878
He's in there.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.751
Hoades needs time to file the charges,
so I put him up here.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.917
Room 1 02.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.922
If this is some kind of dare,
I'm gonna take it.

31:07.966 --> 31:08.955
I trust you.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.118
Been waiting a long time for this, I bet.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.352
So what are you waiting for?

31:43.902 --> 31:47.065
-You drove away! You just left her there!
-Do it! Kill me!

31:47.238 --> 31:50.696
I want it to be over, okay?
I don't care anymore.

31:51.342 --> 31:52.536
I just want it to be over.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.437
I just want it to be over.

32:06.991 --> 32:09.357
-Just wait for their call, all right?
-All right.

32:09.527 --> 32:11.620
-They still in there?
-Yeah.

32:11.796 --> 32:13.457
-We should go in.
-Give him a minute.

32:21.472 --> 32:23.531
You didn't try to help.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.335
You didn't even stop.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.408
I got scared.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.574
I freaked. I....

32:34.752 --> 32:36.777
And she died.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.814
On the side of the road.

32:40.992 --> 32:44.018
I think about that night every day.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.761
That's all I think about.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.531
I wish I could take it back--

32:50.702 --> 32:52.602
I don't wanna hear
about how bad you feel.

32:54.105 --> 32:56.005
Tell me why you did it.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.176
-Does it matter?
-lt matters to me.

33:00.078 --> 33:01.670
I don't know.

33:01.846 --> 33:03.370
Okay?

33:04.449 --> 33:05.780
I mean....

33:06.484 --> 33:08.145
I was coming after you.

33:10.088 --> 33:15.151
You got the girl, I didn't.
And that was hard for me to handle.

33:18.363 --> 33:19.853
I just....

33:20.631 --> 33:23.099
I wanted you to pull over.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.566
And it all just-- It got out of control.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.799
So, what?

33:31.609 --> 33:32.837
It was all an accident?

33:36.647 --> 33:38.444
A mistake?

33:39.217 --> 33:42.118
I know that doesn't change anything.

33:43.221 --> 33:45.985
So if you wanna finish this...

33:48.659 --> 33:50.388
...I'm not gonna fight back.

33:51.729 --> 33:54.254
I'm not doing you any favors.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.865
You live with what you did.

34:03.641 --> 34:04.869
It's over.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.623
-I'm proud of you.
-I'm sorry.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.818
-You hungry?
-Starving.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.362
Well, let's go. Hoades, you got this?

34:27.532 --> 34:29.523
We'll take him in.
Call you after I'm done.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.126
All right, thanks.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.890
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:07.171 --> 35:08.160
Where's my dad?

35:09.273 --> 35:10.262
Gone.

35:11.876 --> 35:12.900
Kaitlin?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.136
Gone.

35:23.087 --> 35:25.521
We can't go on like this anymore,
can we?

35:27.525 --> 35:28.651
No.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.401
I got her voicemail.
I'm gonna go over there.

35:42.573 --> 35:46.031
I don't think you should.
In fact, I am turning your ringer off.

35:46.210 --> 35:50.146
-Don't. My girlfriend's freaking out.
-That's exactly what she should be doing.

35:50.548 --> 35:54.644
Seth, she needs to face what happened
on her own before you can help her with it.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.219
Hey. You guys, your mom says
you're ready for dinner.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.650
Okay.

36:00.525 --> 36:03.426
You wanna cut the bird? I'm hungry.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.620
-We're gonna wait for the rest of the family.
-We're here.

36:06.797 --> 36:09.322
Finally. Are you okay?

36:09.867 --> 36:13.234
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Thank God you're home.

36:15.306 --> 36:18.332
Honey, who are these gentlemen
at the table?

36:18.509 --> 36:20.340
It's a long story, Dad.

36:20.745 --> 36:24.340
-Could you pass the gravy?
-Sure, buddy.

36:26.551 --> 36:29.816
Hey, didn't I defend you
a couple of years ago for a B and E?

36:30.821 --> 36:32.846
Yeah. Now I remember.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.855
I called you Crazy Eyebrow Man.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.220
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

36:38.729 --> 36:42.495
-Old client of mine, how do you like that?
-Yeah, it's pretty wild, Dad.

36:42.667 --> 36:43.929
You wanna hear wild?

36:44.769 --> 36:48.967
I am 90 percent sure that's my dog.

36:49.140 --> 36:53.236
Okay, there's no way that this is your dog.
This is little Julie.

36:55.179 --> 36:56.669
That's Savage.

36:57.415 --> 37:01.749
Baby, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

37:01.919 --> 37:03.181
Come here.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.024
Okay, this cannot be happening.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.184
The Lord giveth and he taketh away.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.393
That's Job 1 :21.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.965
Oh, but I'm no longer religious.
But as a child, I went to bible school...

37:17.134 --> 37:20.069
...and then all of those quotes
just kind of stuck with me.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.036
You are a total freak show.

37:23.774 --> 37:26.766
-lt is so awesome.
-lsn't it, though?

37:30.915 --> 37:35.079
Hey, it's me.
I'm heading back to Providence.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.845
Look, everything you said was true.

37:37.021 --> 37:41.822
And I need to deal with it,
but I need to do it on my own.

37:43.027 --> 37:46.394
I'm sorry I'm such a mess. It's just....

37:47.298 --> 37:49.630
I miss my friend.

37:50.368 --> 37:54.065
But I'll call you as soon as I get my head
screwed on, okay?

37:54.238 --> 37:56.399
I love you.

37:57.441 --> 38:01.172
-Did you reach him?
-I left a message.

38:03.014 --> 38:07.747
I know I didn't like Seth when I met him,
but I got to admit, he's grown on me.

38:09.053 --> 38:11.351
I think you two are gonna be fine.

38:11.522 --> 38:13.513
Thanks for seeing me off.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.318
Of course.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.393
It's so crazy.

38:17.561 --> 38:20.621
To think the next time you come home,
I might not be living here.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.733
Yeah. Are you gonna take that job
in Seattle?

38:24.101 --> 38:26.296
Well, the offer came at the perfect time.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.870
The hospital is famous
for being wonderfully quirky.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.667
It's called Seattle Grace.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.338
Is the stepmonster gonna go with you?

38:33.844 --> 38:35.937
She'll visit.

38:36.113 --> 38:38.479
But we'll take it slow, I promise.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.517
I'm really sorry
that you and Julie broke up.

38:41.686 --> 38:45.520
Yeah, it's not the Thanksgiving
that I had in mind.

38:46.457 --> 38:50.291
It's too bad, because I think
that you and I could both use it, huh?

38:52.997 --> 38:56.160
-You know, I could take a later flight.
-Really?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.859
Yeah, it's not too late
to have Thanksgiving.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.635
What did you have in mind?

39:06.777 --> 39:07.766
I love Chili's.

39:09.714 --> 39:12.205
You and me both, Dad.

39:16.020 --> 39:20.047
-Are we expecting somebody?
-I invited a few of my cousins over.

39:20.224 --> 39:24.422
-I hope that's cool.
-It's cool. I'll handle it.

39:29.533 --> 39:30.932
Hi.

39:32.336 --> 39:36.033
Julie, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
We're having Thanksgiving.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.075
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.471
I don't think
I've heard you say that before.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.612
I don't think I ever meant it.

39:52.857 --> 39:54.347
Well, come on in.

40:06.537 --> 40:10.098
-Sandy, why don't you pull out a chair?
-No.

40:18.716 --> 40:19.876
Go ahead.

40:44.675 --> 40:45.903
Tell me about her.

40:46.744 --> 40:47.733
What?

40:50.114 --> 40:54.175
Anything. Just tell me about her.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.934
I remember the first time I saw her.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.163
She was....

41:17.508 --> 41:21.638
She was wearing this white top thing
and I think she had jeans on.

41:23.914 --> 41:27.281
She was standing
at the bottom of the driveway.

41:28.185 --> 41:30.210
And I thought....

41:33.557 --> 41:34.990
I thought she was really hot.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.425
Really hot.

41:41.465 --> 41:43.194
She gave me this smile.

41:47.438 --> 41:49.702
It was a beautiful smile.
