00:01.500 --> 00:03.834
<i>This is the story of how I died...</i>

00:03.869 --> 00:07.214
<i>and went to heaven!</i>

00:07.339 --> 00:09.439
<i>Okay, so the Kingdom of Corona,
to be exact,</i>

00:09.475 --> 00:12.209
<i>but hey, let's not get hung up
on semantics.</i>

00:12.244 --> 00:14.111
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

00:14.146 --> 00:17.114
<i>a single drop of sunlight
fell from the heavens...</i>

00:17.149 --> 00:18.381
<i>You know what?</i>

00:18.417 --> 00:21.151
<i>I'm just gonna give you
the rapid-fire shorthand here.</i>

00:21.186 --> 00:24.187
<i>The sundrop created a golden
flower with healing powers,</i>

00:24.223 --> 00:27.457
<i>creepy, old, Mother Gothel sang a song
to said flower to regain her youth.</i>

00:27.493 --> 00:30.360
<i>Yada, yada, yada, the queen
got sick, flower healed queen,</i>

00:30.395 --> 00:33.497
<i>queen gave birth to Rapunzel, who was born
with the flower's magical healing powers,</i>

00:33.532 --> 00:36.433
<i>and everything was all flying
lanterns and cheering subjects,</i>

00:36.468 --> 00:39.302
<i>until... Gothel stole the princess</i>

00:39.338 --> 00:42.272
<i>and kept her locked in a tower
for 18 long years.</i>

00:42.307 --> 00:44.541
<i>Then the princess was rescued</i>

00:44.576 --> 00:48.078
<i>by a dashing, steely-eyed,
suave, smoldering,</i>

00:48.113 --> 00:50.213
<i>devilishly charming rogue.</i>

00:50.249 --> 00:52.282
<i>Now, some people might
have called him a thief,</i>

00:52.317 --> 00:56.286
<i>but I always preferred the term
"misunderstood good guy."</i>

00:56.321 --> 00:58.355
<i>You see, it wasn't always easy
for young Eugene.</i>

00:58.390 --> 01:00.457
<i>Raised as an orphan
on the rough streets of...</i>

01:00.492 --> 01:03.093
<i>Hey, Eugene. Focus?</i>

01:03.128 --> 01:04.294
<i>Huh? Oh, right. Sorry.</i>

01:04.328 --> 01:06.463
<i>So, the beautiful
young maiden, that's you,</i>

01:06.532 --> 01:09.232
<i>and the handsome rogue,
that's me, made a deal.</i>

01:09.268 --> 01:12.068
<i>We followed some lanterns,
I saved you from Gothel,</i>

01:12.104 --> 01:14.237
<i>you saved me from... death,</i>

01:14.273 --> 01:17.240
<i>and then you got arguably the world's
most overly dramatic haircut.</i>

01:17.276 --> 01:19.142
<i>- And then...
- And then,</i>

01:19.178 --> 01:21.244
<i>I was reunited with my long-lost family.</i>

01:21.280 --> 01:24.147
<i>But that is where our new story began.</i>

01:24.183 --> 01:25.382
<i>Six months had passed,</i>

01:25.417 --> 01:28.185
<i>I was loving life
inside the Kingdom of Corona,</i>

01:28.220 --> 01:31.221
<i>and my coronation
to officially become princess</i>

01:31.256 --> 01:32.489
<i>had finally come.</i>

01:32.524 --> 01:34.457
<i>We all had a few surprises that day.</i>

01:34.493 --> 01:36.459
<i>Didn't we, sunshine?</i>

01:36.495 --> 01:38.094
<i>Laugh it up, frog.</i>

01:38.130 --> 01:39.396
<i>Now, I know what you're all thinking.</i>

01:39.431 --> 01:41.431
<i>Yes, Eugene and I did get married.</i>

01:41.466 --> 01:43.300
<i>But make no mistake,</i>

01:43.335 --> 01:46.336
<i>getting to the wedding day
and our happily ever after</i>

01:46.371 --> 01:49.539
<i>would be the biggest adventure
we would ever face.</i>

01:49.575 --> 01:51.107
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

01:59.351 --> 02:00.450
They're gaining on us.

02:03.121 --> 02:04.254
There's more of them!

02:04.289 --> 02:06.089
Good. It'll keep things interesting.

02:11.230 --> 02:13.129
Man, these guys are persistent.

02:13.165 --> 02:15.098
So am I. I'll meet you at the wall.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.399
Sounds like a challenge.

02:16.435 --> 02:18.034
Think you can keep up?

02:18.070 --> 02:20.170
Oh, it's not me you have to worry about.

02:20.205 --> 02:21.238
Uh-oh.

02:22.274 --> 02:24.174
They're your problem now.

02:26.411 --> 02:27.444
Oh, great.

02:31.149 --> 02:32.415
Okay, Max, follow my lead...

02:32.451 --> 02:34.184
Oh, log, log, log!

02:38.357 --> 02:41.358
Ooh, good thing
the ground broke his fall.

02:44.529 --> 02:47.464
- Huh?
- Whoa, bunny crossing!

02:47.499 --> 02:50.367
Careful Fidela, watch out,
watch out. Cute little bunnies.

02:59.444 --> 03:01.278
You're not getting away this time!

03:01.313 --> 03:03.146
Hiya!

03:03.181 --> 03:04.314
Sorry.

03:04.349 --> 03:06.249
We're almost there.

03:06.285 --> 03:07.450
Oh, come on!

03:12.357 --> 03:14.291
Whoo-hoo!

03:22.267 --> 03:24.334
Looking good, Cap.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.276
Huh?

03:42.187 --> 03:47.324
Pascal, look at that view.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.328
Haha!

03:54.199 --> 03:56.499
Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking.

03:56.535 --> 03:58.535
Now, it may have seemed like you won,

03:58.570 --> 04:00.270
but you gotta take
into account that my hair

04:00.305 --> 04:02.238
is actually longer than yours now,

04:02.274 --> 04:04.174
so we gotta factor in wind resistance.

04:04.209 --> 04:06.343
Hmm. Wow.

04:06.502 --> 04:10.437
Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?

04:12.250 --> 04:15.352
Yes. Yes, I have.

04:17.221 --> 04:18.454
The game's over, Your Highness.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.224
The welcoming ceremony
is about to begin.

04:21.259 --> 04:24.194
Well, I think we showed
those guards who's boss.

04:24.229 --> 04:28.331
Now, what do you say we go
make you an official princess?

04:28.367 --> 04:31.201
Oh, is that today?

04:31.236 --> 04:33.036
Haha, very funny.

04:33.071 --> 04:34.504
Now come on, we better get
you back to the castle.

04:34.539 --> 04:38.475
Ooh, maybe I can squeeze in
a royal massage.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.510
Before my daily trim, of course.

04:43.444 --> 04:46.411
I know, Pascal.
We'll get out there soon.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.320
Ha. Race you back to the castle.

06:07.032 --> 06:08.164
I'm glad you think so, Raps,

06:08.200 --> 06:11.067
'cause this welcoming ceremony
is just the beginning.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.269
Tomorrow's the festival,
followed by the royal banquet,

06:13.305 --> 06:16.039
and that's all before the
actual coronation on Sunday.

06:16.074 --> 06:19.142
Oh, come on, really?

06:19.177 --> 06:21.478
Look, Rapunzel, I know this
princess thing is new to you,

06:21.513 --> 06:24.247
but you've got to at least
try to act the part.

06:24.282 --> 06:25.448
Trust me, Cassandra,

06:25.484 --> 06:28.251
I know how important this is to my dad.

06:33.125 --> 06:35.391
Good. We have guests
from all over the world.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.260
I want them to know that they are safe.

06:37.295 --> 06:39.429
Everything for my little girl's
coronation weekend

06:39.464 --> 06:42.031

but all of Corona.

07:06.391 --> 07:09.292
Don't worry, Dad. I won't let you down.

07:09.327 --> 07:12.362
But while we're on the whole

07:12.397 --> 07:15.999
I mean, all these royal
activities are great,

07:16.034 --> 07:18.168
but do you think I might be able

07:18.203 --> 07:20.003
to catch a little downtime soon?

07:20.038 --> 07:22.372
I know this is all new,
but you'll adjust.

Just introducing myself

09:20.325 --> 09:22.992
to the most important
people in the world.

09:23.028 --> 09:25.094
Representing my mom, dad,

09:25.130 --> 09:27.397
and the entire kingdom.

09:27.432 --> 09:30.066
We got this.

09:51.556 --> 09:53.589
Lady Caine, what is it?

09:54.626 --> 09:58.661
Time to pay our respects
to our beloved royals.

10:03.535 --> 10:06.402
We're good at making
people feel welcome.

10:06.438 --> 10:10.640
This is completely doable... ish.

10:25.657 --> 10:27.590
Your Highness, I present

10:27.625 --> 10:31.361
Dame Elizabeth Van Hoskins of Rochester.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.665
Get in here!

10:35.700 --> 10:38.568
So nice to meet you.

10:46.411 --> 10:50.380
Um, perhaps you should refrain
from the bear hugs, sweetheart.

10:50.415 --> 10:54.450
Oh, no bear hugs. Gotcha. Sorry.

10:54.486 --> 10:59.722
I present Lieutenant Commander
General James Rutherford-Carver III.

10:59.758 --> 11:02.525
Phew. That's kind of a mouthful.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.360
Is it okay if I call you Jimmy?

11:04.396 --> 11:06.396
I'd prefer you didn't.

11:06.431 --> 11:07.630
Well, um...

11:07.665 --> 11:09.699
Welcome all the same then.

11:09.734 --> 11:13.336
I present the Duchess of Quintonia.

11:13.371 --> 11:16.672
Wow, can I just say, I love your hair.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.541
I used to have
really long hair too, but...

11:18.576 --> 11:21.344
This is a handwoven coiffure

11:21.379 --> 11:24.380
weft from the finest silk
and Vacuna fabrics.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.582
It designates high social status.

11:26.618 --> 11:28.651
You think you'd know that.

11:28.686 --> 11:32.622
Uh, still. Nice to meet you.

11:32.657 --> 11:36.426
Sadly not nice enough
to wear shoes, I'm afraid.

11:37.829 --> 11:39.562
Really.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.368
Sorry.

11:55.847 --> 11:58.815
So, I think we learned
something very valuable today.

11:58.850 --> 12:01.384
There's a time and place for bear hugs.

12:03.788 --> 12:05.421
Hey, are you okay?

12:05.457 --> 12:08.391
Yeah, great. Why wouldn't I be?

12:09.661 --> 12:12.328
It's just...

12:12.363 --> 12:15.631
Eugene, is all this everything
you dreamed it would be?

12:17.535 --> 12:20.503
Rapunzel, you are my dream.

12:20.538 --> 12:22.405
So as long as you're with me,

12:22.440 --> 12:25.308
that answer's always gonna be yes.

12:25.343 --> 12:26.509
Why? Don't you feel the same way?

12:26.544 --> 12:27.743
No... Ye-Yes!

12:27.779 --> 12:29.445
I mean, of course I do!

12:29.481 --> 12:33.483
I love you with all my heart, Eugene.

12:34.686 --> 12:36.619
Look, I know this has got be weird.

12:36.654 --> 12:39.455
No one's expecting you
to take it all in overnight.

12:39.491 --> 12:41.624
But believe me, I've been
all around the world

12:41.659 --> 12:43.426
and it doesn't get any better than this.

12:43.461 --> 12:46.596
This castle, our friends,
your family, each other.

12:46.631 --> 12:47.797
What else could you possibly want?

12:49.767 --> 12:51.334
Nothing.

12:52.403 --> 12:53.469
Time to go!

12:56.407 --> 12:58.541
How's that water feeling, Fitzherbert?

12:58.576 --> 13:01.544
Dark and icy.

13:01.579 --> 13:03.312
Just like you.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.681
Come on, Rapunzel, it's time to head in.

13:05.717 --> 13:07.650
You don't want to be
exhausted for tomorrow.

13:07.685 --> 13:10.286
Right! My morning off!

13:11.789 --> 13:13.456
Sorry!

13:18.663 --> 13:20.429
Man, she scares me.

13:32.644 --> 13:36.779
The princess, Rapunzel,
will spend her day about town!

13:59.771 --> 14:00.736
Oh!

14:24.329 --> 14:25.361
Let me guess.

14:25.396 --> 14:27.496
Big day on the town
wasn't all you hoped it'd be?

14:27.532 --> 14:30.466
It was... interesting.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.302
Uh huh, I bet.

14:33.338 --> 14:36.639
I just wish my dad would let me
get out and see the real world.

14:36.674 --> 14:38.708
You know, if you really wanted,

14:38.743 --> 14:40.476
I could get you in and out of here

14:40.511 --> 14:43.312
before anyone even knew
that we were gone.

14:44.415 --> 14:46.649
Uh, you mean sneak me out?

14:46.684 --> 14:47.783
Exactly.

14:47.819 --> 14:50.453
What you do when no one's
looking is your business.

14:52.890 --> 14:55.758
The royal banquet is ready
to receive the princess now.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.593
Cheer up, Raps.

14:57.629 --> 14:59.762
Hey, maybe your dad got someone
to chew your food for you.

15:14.445 --> 15:16.646
I'm in charge of the seating charts.

15:16.681 --> 15:18.280
One of the perks of the job.

15:19.450 --> 15:21.651
I don't understand why
you are so upset, sweetheart.

15:21.686 --> 15:23.653
I said you could do whatever you wanted.

15:23.688 --> 15:24.854
That's exactly what you did.

15:24.889 --> 15:29.525
Hmm, you didn't say anything
about a battalion tagging along.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.760
Why would I need to?

15:30.795 --> 15:32.361
You're royalty,

15:32.397 --> 15:34.296
making a public appearance.

15:34.332 --> 15:35.765
But, Dad...

15:35.800 --> 15:38.467
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dukes and Duchesses,

15:38.503 --> 15:39.635
Barons and Baronesses,

15:39.671 --> 15:43.406
Marquis and, you know,
the female version of those,

15:43.441 --> 15:45.775
may I share a moment
of history with you.

15:45.810 --> 15:48.511
Princess, would you join me up here?

15:52.517 --> 15:54.717
Tonight, we celebrate
our love for the princess.

15:54.752 --> 15:57.353
I, for one, can think of no better way

15:57.388 --> 15:59.689
to celebrate the love I have
for this woman than this.

16:03.361 --> 16:05.594
Oh, Eugene!
Wait. Did you drop something?

16:05.630 --> 16:06.729
No.

16:11.436 --> 16:14.470
Rapunzel, from the moment
I first met you

16:14.505 --> 16:17.440
and you knocked me out
with that frying pan,

16:17.475 --> 16:18.574
I knew it was love.

16:18.609 --> 16:20.643
You're my light, you're my best friend

16:20.678 --> 16:22.645
and I want to be
your partner in all things.

16:24.582 --> 16:27.616
I can't wait to laugh
with you and share with you.

16:27.652 --> 16:29.618
I see us raising our children here,

16:29.654 --> 16:31.387
and our children's children,

16:31.422 --> 16:33.656
and celebrating banquets
of our own in this very hall

16:33.691 --> 16:38.694
for many, many, many,
many years to come.

16:38.730 --> 16:41.464
I want to ride our horses
out to the Corona wall together

16:41.499 --> 16:44.300
each and every morning
until we're both very,

16:44.335 --> 16:46.769
very old and gray.

16:46.804 --> 16:48.771
I love you, Rapunzel,

16:48.806 --> 16:52.475
and I want to spend the rest
of our lives here together.

16:52.510 --> 16:55.344
Here? In this...

16:55.379 --> 16:57.546
castle forever?

16:57.582 --> 16:59.315
I mean, unless you want to rent,

16:59.350 --> 17:01.250
but I hardly see how
we're going to top this.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.519
<i>And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you here,</i>

17:03.554 --> 17:05.721
<i>and it doesn't get any better
than this, this castle...</i>

17:05.757 --> 17:09.525
<i>Princesses need
to be protected at all times.</i>

17:09.560 --> 17:12.528
Rapunzel? Rapunzel?

17:12.563 --> 17:15.631
I've... Wow!

17:15.665 --> 17:19.335
I love you, Eugene, but...

17:19.369 --> 17:20.536
but I can't!

17:20.570 --> 17:22.505
Just not, not now.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.374
Um, I need some air.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.386
Oh, I feel horrible about Eugene.

17:37.421 --> 17:39.588
I... I do love him,

17:39.624 --> 17:41.657
and I wanna marry him someday...

17:41.692 --> 17:43.392
but not like this!

17:44.495 --> 17:46.595
Ugh! I need to get out and clear my head

17:46.631 --> 17:49.398
without a fleet of guards tailing me.

17:49.433 --> 17:50.733
Say no more.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.537
Whoa!

17:56.808 --> 17:58.474
Where's the war?

17:58.509 --> 18:01.410
Well, when your dad is
captain of the guards,

18:01.445 --> 18:04.280
you tend to collect stuff.

18:15.526 --> 18:18.694
I have a feeling
this is going to be fun.

18:18.729 --> 18:20.663
Pascal, I need you to stay here

18:20.698 --> 18:23.299
and make sure no one knows I'm gone.

18:31.409 --> 18:33.897
The princess's lady-in-waiting
made it expressly clear...

18:33.922 --> 18:35.377
Lady in wait...

18:35.413 --> 18:37.346
What? You mean Cassandra?

18:37.381 --> 18:39.682
First off, calling Cassandra
a "lady" anything,

18:39.717 --> 18:41.717
is being incredibly generous.

18:41.752 --> 18:43.652
Secondly, come on, Stan.

18:43.688 --> 18:46.455
It's me, your buddy, Eugene.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.390
Eugene the fiend.

18:48.426 --> 18:50.726
You know Rapunzel would want
to talk to me if you let me in.

18:50.761 --> 18:52.661
Sorry, Eugene, orders are orders.

18:52.697 --> 18:56.699
All right. Just doing your job.
I respect that.

18:56.734 --> 18:59.301
You sure there's no way to let me in?

19:05.309 --> 19:06.575
Rapunzel?

19:08.346 --> 19:09.645
Rapunzel?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.650
There you are, um...

19:14.685 --> 19:16.619
Look, Rapunzel, I am sorry.

19:16.654 --> 19:19.588
I am sorry, I should never have
put you on the spot like that.

19:20.691 --> 19:22.691
But I want you to know, I meant it.

19:22.727 --> 19:25.361
I want to marry you, I love you.

19:26.764 --> 19:29.732
It's okay, you're still upset,
I understand.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.601
You're not ready to say it back yet.

19:32.637 --> 19:34.370
Totally cool.

19:35.573 --> 19:37.673
Oh man, that is a good pillow!

19:37.708 --> 19:38.741
What is that, goose down?

19:38.776 --> 19:40.442
Some kind of down?

19:40.478 --> 19:42.378
Horse hair? Alpaca?

19:43.714 --> 19:45.514
Sorry, look...

19:45.549 --> 19:47.750
I know there's still a ton of
details we need to figure out...

19:47.785 --> 19:49.652
and I may have jumped the gun a little.

19:49.687 --> 19:51.420
It's just that...

19:51.455 --> 19:54.356
growing up poor and alone...

19:54.392 --> 19:56.525
I got used to having nothing.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
But now with you,

19:58.596 --> 20:00.496
I finally have something,
you know? We have something.

20:00.531 --> 20:01.764
Something that is amazing.

20:01.799 --> 20:04.566
And I guess tonight I was just
trying to keep it that way.

20:04.602 --> 20:06.769
And I thought that's what
you wanted too,

20:06.804 --> 20:08.704
but I guess I was wrong.

20:11.475 --> 20:14.410
Oh come on, say something.

20:14.445 --> 20:15.678
Ooh!

20:18.783 --> 20:21.717
Fantastic. I just poured
my heart out to a frog.

20:21.752 --> 20:24.386
Okay, where did she go?

20:24.422 --> 20:27.323
Pascal, you do realize that if
the king finds out she's gone,

20:27.358 --> 20:28.557
we're all going to be
in big trouble right?

20:30.394 --> 20:31.727
I'm aware it's not protocol, Pete,

20:31.762 --> 20:34.663
I just happen to think it
highlights my mustache.

20:34.699 --> 20:37.399
Hey, Stan, great look!

20:37.435 --> 20:39.335
I mean it really brings out the stache!

20:40.805 --> 20:43.639
All right, you got us all here.

20:43.674 --> 20:45.541
What's this plan of yours?

20:45.576 --> 20:47.743
Oh, it's not my plan, boys.

20:47.778 --> 20:50.512
It's Lady Caine's plan.

20:50.548 --> 20:52.381
Did he say Lady Caine?

20:52.416 --> 20:56.352
See, 18 years ago the princess
was taken from Corona,

20:56.387 --> 20:59.521
and it was because of her
the king unfairly cracked down

20:59.557 --> 21:03.525
on all those he considered undesirable.

21:03.561 --> 21:04.660
Us.

21:04.695 --> 21:06.695
Yeah, so?

21:06.731 --> 21:09.498
Gentleman, Lady Caine is promising

21:09.533 --> 21:12.368
not only to make you all rich,

21:12.403 --> 21:14.703
but is offering you the opportunity

21:14.739 --> 21:17.339
to exact revenge on the king

21:17.375 --> 21:19.675
and his precious little princess.

21:21.479 --> 21:23.545
So, who's in?

21:32.656 --> 21:35.491
Is that a secret passage?

21:35.526 --> 21:38.761
It was before you announced it
to the whole castle.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.629
Rapunzel?

21:40.664 --> 21:42.798
Rapunzel?

21:42.833 --> 21:45.367
Rapunzel, are you in there?

21:46.704 --> 21:48.737
Is who in there, Eugene?

21:48.773 --> 21:50.639
Huh? Uh, no one.

21:50.674 --> 21:53.550
This is just part of my nightly routine.

21:53.586 --> 21:55.511
You know? Yeah, checking
the castle for intruders,

21:55.546 --> 21:57.184
keeping an eye on Rapunzel,
like I promised.

21:57.209 --> 21:59.448
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, is anyone in there?

21:59.483 --> 22:00.909
No? Good!

22:00.934 --> 22:02.075
See?

22:02.099 --> 22:04.697
- The system works, really well I think...
- Eugene...

22:04.722 --> 22:06.688
Where is Rapunzel?

22:08.334 --> 22:10.526
Uh, ah... in her room of course.

22:10.561 --> 22:12.436
Good. I'd like to speak with her.

22:12.471 --> 22:14.471
You can't!

22:14.507 --> 22:16.507
I mean, you can, obviously...

22:16.542 --> 22:18.509
you can do whatever you want.
You're the king!

22:18.544 --> 22:22.312
A very large, intimidating, beardy,

22:22.348 --> 22:25.482
yet clearly understanding, King.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.618
It's just, she's still upset

22:27.653 --> 22:29.720
and she said she needed time alone.

22:29.755 --> 22:32.523
I was only trying to respect that.

22:32.558 --> 22:35.459
But, like I said, you are the king,

22:36.829 --> 22:40.531
the very sweet and non-hostile king.

22:41.634 --> 22:45.769
Well, maybe she does need
some time to herself,

22:45.805 --> 22:49.573
but when you see her please tell
her that I am looking for her.

22:49.608 --> 22:52.342
Sir, about the whole proposal earlier.

22:52.378 --> 22:54.445
That didn't go quite as I had hoped.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.757
We'll discuss that later, son,

22:57.128 --> 22:59.175
much later.

22:59.393 --> 23:02.394
Right, we both have bigger fish to fry.

23:07.357 --> 23:09.390
That was so fun!

23:09.426 --> 23:11.492
I'd like to take this
opportunity to remind you that

23:11.528 --> 23:14.395
we're supposed to be sneaking out.

23:14.431 --> 23:16.364
Cass, I think you'll discover that

23:16.399 --> 23:18.499
I can be pretty sneaky when I need to...

23:20.637 --> 23:22.303
Nightly patrols.

23:22.339 --> 23:23.605
We can get by them if we time it right.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.241
Wait, how did you know they were coming?

23:27.277 --> 23:29.477
I have eyes in the sky.

23:34.250 --> 23:36.351
That is amazing.

23:36.386 --> 23:38.252
You have your own owl.

23:38.288 --> 23:39.253
What's his name?

23:40.357 --> 23:41.322
Owl.

23:45.495 --> 23:46.561
Max!

23:46.596 --> 23:49.197
Yeah, when he heard
I was sneaking you out of here

23:49.232 --> 23:51.399
he insisted he come along.

23:51.434 --> 23:52.667
And between you and me,

23:52.702 --> 23:55.269
I think he's got something
for you know who.

23:56.439 --> 23:59.307
Hmm, it'll be our secret.

24:20.497 --> 24:22.363
Oh honey, stop beating yourself up.

24:22.399 --> 24:24.332
Rapunzel just needs some space.

24:24.367 --> 24:27.635
Nobody said dealing with
teenagers would be easy.

24:27.671 --> 24:29.570
Teenager or not, Ariana,

24:29.606 --> 24:31.606
she will be queen one day.

24:31.641 --> 24:34.242
I have to prepare her for that.

24:39.315 --> 24:40.648

26:54.317 --> 26:56.184
Just remember,

26:56.219 --> 26:59.287
no one can ever know I took you
outside the walls of Corona.

26:59.322 --> 27:02.323
Don't worry!
No one is going to find out.

27:10.433 --> 27:12.366
Whoa! Whoa, Max.

27:12.402 --> 27:14.535
All right, this looks dangerous.
Can you...

27:14.571 --> 27:17.438
can you stay here
and watch Fidela for me?

27:27.417 --> 27:30.218
So, what did you want to show me?

27:31.387 --> 27:34.188
Believe me, it's better
if you see it for yourself.

27:38.428 --> 27:40.528
They're beautiful.

27:40.563 --> 27:42.230
What are they?

27:42.265 --> 27:44.398
Don't know. They just
kind of sprouted up here

27:44.434 --> 27:45.633
about a year ago.

27:45.668 --> 27:47.568
And watch this...

27:47.604 --> 27:51.205
Uh, you might want to
stand back for this one.

27:53.243 --> 27:54.308
Wow!

27:54.344 --> 27:55.509
They're unbreakable.

27:55.545 --> 27:57.511
Want to know the weirdest part?

28:03.353 --> 28:05.386
This is where they found
the miracle flower

28:05.421 --> 28:07.221
that saved your mom.

28:07.257 --> 28:08.389
And me.

28:47.263 --> 28:48.262
Wait! What is...

28:48.298 --> 28:50.598
Get to the horses as fast as you can
and don't look back, Rapunzel.

28:56.439 --> 28:58.472
Don't stop, Rapunzel. Keep going!

29:13.589 --> 29:15.523
Um, Cassandra!

29:15.558 --> 29:17.491
Keep moving, Rapunzel. We need to get...

29:17.527 --> 29:19.327
Whoa! What?

29:26.625 --> 29:27.892
What happened?

29:27.916 --> 29:29.587
I have no idea,

29:29.688 --> 29:31.021
but we'll have to deal with it later.

29:31.056 --> 29:32.923
Let's go!

29:48.673 --> 29:49.739
Help!

29:49.775 --> 29:51.942
Cassandra! My hair!

30:31.984 --> 30:33.850
Whoa!

31:12.124 --> 31:13.690
Ahh!

31:15.661 --> 31:16.827
Cassandra!

31:16.862 --> 31:18.528
Whoa!

31:25.738 --> 31:27.726
See? I told you I'd get you in and out

31:27.751 --> 31:28.939
without anyone knowing.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.281
Piece of cake.

31:30.332 --> 31:31.575
Piece of cake?

31:31.610 --> 31:33.953
Uh, did you see the 70 feet of

31:33.978 --> 31:35.129
"my father's going to kill me,"

31:35.164 --> 31:36.964
growing from my head?

31:36.999 --> 31:38.966
One problem at a time please.

31:42.972 --> 31:44.071
We've got a problem.

31:44.106 --> 31:45.973
Because of the coronation,
they've doubled security

31:46.008 --> 31:47.174
at the gates today.

31:47.210 --> 31:48.943
And there's no other way in?

31:48.978 --> 31:51.866
Sure, if you want to walk in the
front door in broad daylight.

31:54.729 --> 31:57.275
Hmm, maybe we don't need the front door.

32:13.535 --> 32:15.335
I told him it wasn't protocol, sir.

32:27.349 --> 32:29.750
Okay, quick, hand me the scissors.

32:31.387 --> 32:32.653
So what do we wanna do here?

32:32.688 --> 32:34.688
Maybe a bob? How about some layers?

32:34.723 --> 32:36.356
Just cut it!

32:40.629 --> 32:41.762
Uh-oh.

32:41.797 --> 32:43.630
Uh-oh? Why uh-oh?

32:43.666 --> 32:45.532
There shouldn't be any uh-ohs.

32:46.702 --> 32:47.701
Uh-oh.

32:47.736 --> 32:49.569
Was your hair always this strong?

32:49.605 --> 32:50.882
What? No!

32:50.907 --> 32:52.539
Try again.

32:57.033 --> 32:59.067
We're gonna need a plan B.

33:02.451 --> 33:03.417
Cover your eyes.

33:06.455 --> 33:07.587
Ha!

33:20.803 --> 33:22.436
Forget it.

33:22.471 --> 33:24.571
It's just like those stupid
rocks. It's unbreakable.

33:24.606 --> 33:26.440
We can't forget it!

33:26.475 --> 33:28.342
Today is my coronation.

33:29.511 --> 33:32.312
Hey, sunshine, are you in there?

33:32.348 --> 33:33.680
You can't let Eugene see you.

33:33.716 --> 33:34.781
What? Why?

33:34.817 --> 33:36.583
He can't know anything about last night.

33:36.618 --> 33:37.851
I told you, Rapunzel.

33:37.886 --> 33:40.554
If it gets out that I took you
outside Corona, I'm done for.

33:40.589 --> 33:41.788
But I trust Eugene.

33:41.824 --> 33:43.423
Well, I don't.

33:43.459 --> 33:45.492
My dad will have me
taken off princess detail.

33:45.527 --> 33:47.794
We'll never see each other again.

33:47.830 --> 33:49.696
Oh come on, we've been
looking for you all night.

33:54.403 --> 33:55.702
Hey, are you okay in there?

33:55.738 --> 33:56.770
I can hear you, you know?

33:56.805 --> 33:58.505
Rapunzel!

34:00.376 --> 34:01.408
Rapunzel?

34:02.778 --> 34:04.277
Rapunzel?

34:05.381 --> 34:06.713
Stand back!

34:06.749 --> 34:09.716
Are you ok... Holy hair!

34:18.494 --> 34:20.494
Surprise!

34:20.529 --> 34:23.362
Whoa! Ooh, mama! Ha!

34:23.399 --> 34:25.364
Okay! Okay.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.733
This is new, I mean, no! Not new.

34:26.768 --> 34:28.435
Right? Because we've
seen this, obviously.

34:28.469 --> 34:29.936
That whole magic thing
is involved again.

34:29.972 --> 34:32.371
It was magic right? Actually, you
know what? You don't need to tell me.

34:32.408 --> 34:34.440
I'm just going to go ahead and say
your hair magically grew back.

34:34.476 --> 34:36.476
I'm not going to ask how. Obviously
you don't want to tell me

34:36.512 --> 34:38.411
or else you wouldn't have
to tried to hide it from me.

34:38.447 --> 34:39.545
So, I won't ask how it grew back,

34:39.581 --> 34:40.781
but tell me please,
how did it grow back?

34:40.815 --> 34:42.681
Don't answer that. The important
thing is you're okay.

34:42.717 --> 34:45.619
You're okay, right? Because as long as
you're okay, I don't care what happened.

34:45.654 --> 34:47.387
But I mean, I care, obviously I care,

34:47.422 --> 34:48.722
but I'm sure there is
a reasonable explanation.

34:48.757 --> 34:50.456
Where is the war?

34:50.492 --> 34:51.591
That you'll share when you're ready.

34:52.661 --> 34:54.428
Thank you for understanding.

34:54.463 --> 34:56.329
Oh, come one, really?

34:56.364 --> 34:57.731
I thought we trusted
each other, Rapunzel.

34:57.766 --> 35:00.734
We do! I do, it's just...

35:00.769 --> 35:02.536
Fine, fine, fine. You know what?

35:02.571 --> 35:04.337
I can't make you tell me what happened,

35:04.373 --> 35:07.274
but obviously you're keeping
something from me.

35:07.309 --> 35:09.376
But whatever it is,
I just want you to know

35:09.411 --> 35:12.512
you should never feel like you
have to hide anything from me.

35:17.719 --> 35:19.619
You don't hide things
from the people you love.

35:19.655 --> 35:21.588
Ever.

35:21.623 --> 35:22.689
Rapunzel, honey.

35:22.724 --> 35:24.591
Hide your hair, woman!

35:24.626 --> 35:25.692
You gotta hid your hair.

35:25.727 --> 35:27.594
Rapunzel?

35:27.629 --> 35:29.696
May I come in, sweetheart?

35:32.668 --> 35:34.734
You can't! I'm...

35:34.770 --> 35:36.570
brushing my teeth!

35:36.605 --> 35:38.371
Oh, good.

35:38.407 --> 35:40.607
But I can still come in, can't I?

35:40.642 --> 35:43.376
Believe me Mom, you do not want to.

35:43.412 --> 35:44.544
Morning breath.

35:44.580 --> 35:47.581
Wouldn't wanna expose you to that.

35:47.616 --> 35:50.350
That's ah, very thoughtful of you.

35:50.385 --> 35:54.421
Um, Dad and I want you to join
us on the terrace for breakfast.

35:54.456 --> 35:55.789
Um, I don't know.

35:55.824 --> 35:59.593
There's a lot of stuff
I have to do to get ready.

35:59.628 --> 36:01.495
Rapunzel, well,

36:01.530 --> 36:04.297
your father has something very
important to share with you.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.600
He's... he's been waiting all night.

36:06.635 --> 36:09.536
Yeah, sure, um...

36:09.571 --> 36:11.738
I will meet you there in a minute?

36:13.642 --> 36:16.276
The coronation is in two hours!

36:16.311 --> 36:18.578
How am I suppose to cut this hair?

36:22.551 --> 36:24.618
I might have an idea.

36:26.722 --> 36:30.690
So, Rapunzel, ready for the big day?

36:30.726 --> 36:34.461
You bet! Already
into the princess spirit.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.464
The bigger the wig,
the better the princess, right?

36:37.499 --> 36:40.081
So Dad, Mom said you wanted to talk.

36:40.106 --> 36:42.435
Yes... Rapunzel, last night,

36:42.471 --> 36:44.404
your mother and I had a discussion.

36:45.607 --> 36:47.741
I know that I'm not
always able to separate

36:47.776 --> 36:49.609
the man from the king

36:49.645 --> 36:51.511
and separating the father from the king

36:51.547 --> 36:53.713
has proven even more difficult.

36:55.384 --> 36:57.450
Sweetheart, I know this

36:57.486 --> 36:59.753
new life is hard to get used to,

36:59.788 --> 37:01.621
and I'm sure that sometimes you wish

37:01.657 --> 37:02.656
I would get out of your hair.

37:04.393 --> 37:05.559
Ooh, sorry.

37:05.594 --> 37:07.527
It's a little, um, dry out here.

37:07.563 --> 37:09.362
Anyone else dry?

37:09.398 --> 37:10.730
Rapunzel,

37:10.766 --> 37:13.366
you are going to be queen someday.

37:13.402 --> 37:16.403
A great queen with a
magnificent kingdom.

37:16.438 --> 37:18.305
But you know better than anyone else

37:18.340 --> 37:20.307
what a dangerous and evil place

37:20.342 --> 37:22.275
the world can be.

37:22.311 --> 37:23.677
And the barrier keeping
us safe from that

37:23.712 --> 37:26.446
is sometimes more fragile
than it appears.

37:26.481 --> 37:28.515
When that evil rears its ugly head

37:28.550 --> 37:31.451
it is my job to protect Corona from it.

37:31.486 --> 37:34.588
And one day, that will be
your responsibility.

37:34.623 --> 37:36.723
And I must teach you how to carry it.

37:36.758 --> 37:39.426
But that is many, many years away.

37:39.461 --> 37:42.562
Until that burden is imposed on you,

37:42.598 --> 37:44.631
I'm asking that you trust me

37:44.666 --> 37:47.300
that I know how to
keep danger as far away

37:47.336 --> 37:48.735
from you and this kingdom

37:48.770 --> 37:50.570
as is humanly possible.

37:50.606 --> 37:52.305
Do you understand?

37:52.341 --> 37:54.474
It was until last night that I realized

37:54.509 --> 37:57.444
that my methods may have at times seemed

37:57.479 --> 37:59.779
strict or unfair or...

37:59.815 --> 38:02.382
Does this mean I can have
more time to myself

38:02.417 --> 38:05.318
without having half the royal
guard over my shoulder?

38:05.354 --> 38:07.354
Well, this means I'm willing

38:07.389 --> 38:09.589
to reconsider those methods.

38:09.625 --> 38:11.324
But I make no promises.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.460
I can work with that.

38:16.431 --> 38:18.264
Well, I should go.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.600
I have a lot of princessing up to do.

38:23.739 --> 38:25.705
You're right, Arianna.

38:25.741 --> 38:28.508
Teenagers are a whole new frontier.

38:30.379 --> 38:31.411
How are ya?

38:41.356 --> 38:42.522
Oh, come on!

38:42.557 --> 38:44.391
What is going on with Rapunzel?

38:44.426 --> 38:45.592
I mean, is it something I did?

38:45.627 --> 38:46.726
Probably.

38:46.762 --> 38:49.729
And since when did she
start keeping secrets from me?

38:49.765 --> 38:52.532
Hey, Fitzherbert, I need to get
this done before the coronation,

38:52.567 --> 38:54.567
so do you mind throwing your
pity party someplace else?

38:54.603 --> 38:56.603
Look, Cassandra,

38:56.638 --> 38:59.305
I know you don't like me for Rapunzel...

38:59.341 --> 39:00.440
Oh, that's not true.

39:00.475 --> 39:01.708
I don't like you for anyone.

39:01.743 --> 39:03.410
I just want what's best for her.

39:03.445 --> 39:04.678
You don't say!

39:04.713 --> 39:06.680
Of course! I want her to feel safe.

39:06.715 --> 39:09.649
I want her to be taken care of
and I want her to be happy here.

39:09.685 --> 39:12.452
Funny, you seem to have
a pretty good handle

39:12.487 --> 39:13.687
on the things you want.

39:18.593 --> 39:20.274
Oh, don't you start.

39:25.634 --> 39:27.180
Hi, honey.

39:27.205 --> 39:28.735
Oh, hi Mom.

39:28.770 --> 39:31.337
You left so quickly after breakfast I...

39:31.373 --> 39:33.573
I didn't have a chance
to give this to you.

39:33.608 --> 39:37.644
I know it's a little early
for a coronation gift but...

39:37.679 --> 39:40.714
I thought you might like to see it now.

39:44.619 --> 39:46.453
18th of July...

39:46.488 --> 39:51.624
We embarked on a safari to the most
remote plains of the third continent.

39:51.660 --> 39:53.293
21st of May...

39:53.328 --> 39:55.628
Had to take shelter in a hidden cave

39:55.664 --> 39:58.331
to escape the fury of a violent storm.

39:58.366 --> 39:59.599
12th of April...

39:59.634 --> 40:03.303
Helped villagers rebuild
their war torn homes.

40:03.338 --> 40:05.538
Mom, is this yours?

40:05.574 --> 40:08.408
Did you actually do all this?

40:08.443 --> 40:09.642
Rapunzel,

40:09.678 --> 40:11.745
before I met your father,

40:11.780 --> 40:14.380
I was so much like you.

40:14.416 --> 40:17.751
I had no idea what I was
supposed to have in this world.

40:17.786 --> 40:21.788
So I went out and found my own way.

40:24.726 --> 40:27.427
You're father is right about one thing,

40:27.462 --> 40:29.562
You will be queen someday,

40:29.598 --> 40:31.498
but only you get to decide

40:31.533 --> 40:33.333
what kind of queen you'll be.

40:33.368 --> 40:36.469
And no one can tell you the
best way to make that decision.

40:36.505 --> 40:38.805
But how can I if...

40:38.840 --> 40:40.540
Wait...

40:40.575 --> 40:42.675
- are you suggesting that I should...
- Honey...

40:42.711 --> 40:45.478
find a way to fill those pages.

40:45.514 --> 40:47.547
I only ask that you be safe,

40:47.582 --> 40:50.583
be smart, and above all...

40:50.619 --> 40:52.418
be true to yourself.

40:56.491 --> 40:58.558
<i>Plus est en vous?</i>

40:58.593 --> 41:00.560
<i>Plus est en vous.</i>

41:00.595 --> 41:03.563
It means, "There is more in you."

41:17.646 --> 41:19.479
This would have been so much easier

41:19.514 --> 41:20.680
with the other girls helping,

41:20.715 --> 41:21.815
but they're such gossips,

41:21.850 --> 41:23.650
half the kingdom would know
about your hair by now.

41:23.685 --> 41:25.518
Are you sure you can't see it?

41:26.621 --> 41:29.489
Are you sure you can pull this off?

41:37.732 --> 41:39.732
I have to, Cassandra.

41:39.768 --> 41:41.801
Just be careful you don't trip on this.

41:41.837 --> 41:45.371
It's not the dress I'm worried about.

41:45.407 --> 41:47.774
How do people walk in these things?

41:47.809 --> 41:49.676
Whoa!

41:49.711 --> 41:51.344
Just relax.

41:51.379 --> 41:53.479
This is going to be fine.

41:53.515 --> 41:55.615
I can't wait any longer.

41:55.650 --> 41:57.750
This better work, Pocket.

41:57.786 --> 41:59.786
Don't you worry, boys.

41:59.821 --> 42:02.622
Lady Caine will not disappoint.

42:07.696 --> 42:08.761
Okay.

42:19.407 --> 42:20.373
Wow.

42:28.617 --> 42:30.450
Whoa!

42:30.485 --> 42:31.651
Whoa!

42:35.423 --> 42:36.656
Oh, whoa!

42:36.691 --> 42:39.525
How embarrassing for her.

42:39.561 --> 42:41.728
This is going to take forever.

42:53.475 --> 42:56.342
Hello? Can anyone help me?

42:56.378 --> 43:00.413
Silly me, I must've taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

43:00.448 --> 43:02.415
I'll be glad to help you, madam.

43:02.450 --> 43:06.352
Oh, you're too kind!

43:12.360 --> 43:13.760
Hey, Madam Poppycock?

43:13.795 --> 43:15.495
The party's upstairs.

43:16.731 --> 43:19.599
Meet Lady Caine.

43:19.634 --> 43:22.402
You're a lot stronger than you look.

43:23.505 --> 43:25.338
I'm a lot of things.

43:27.575 --> 43:29.676
Let the show begin.

43:29.711 --> 43:32.612
I'm gonna need you to step back
into that cell, pronto.

43:34.783 --> 43:38.484
That there is a nice suit.

43:42.278 --> 43:44.211
The wearer of this crown

43:44.247 --> 43:46.755
is a shining example of the promise

43:46.783 --> 43:48.372
that is Corona,

43:48.397 --> 43:50.151
an ambassador of goodwill

43:50.186 --> 43:52.053
to those visiting from afar,

43:52.088 --> 43:54.155
and an inspiration

43:54.190 --> 43:56.157
to those fortunate enough

43:56.192 --> 43:58.793
to live within her borders.

43:58.828 --> 44:02.096
But above all, the chief
responsibility of the crown

44:02.131 --> 44:05.633
is to keep the people of Corona safe

44:05.668 --> 44:07.462
from dangers, near and far.

44:07.670 --> 44:09.704
And their are many.

44:09.739 --> 44:11.906
This mandate is not to be taken

44:11.941 --> 44:13.541
- lightly.
- Go find Max.

44:13.576 --> 44:16.844
There will come a day when
the walls that surround Corona

44:16.880 --> 44:20.448
are threatened by malfeasance. A day...

44:20.483 --> 44:23.484
- Attention, please!
- Lady Caine?

44:36.900 --> 44:38.833
Release my guests immediately.

44:38.868 --> 44:40.835
What's the matter, Fred?

44:40.870 --> 44:43.704
Am I ruining your
little girl's perfect day?

44:43.740 --> 44:45.473
The duchess?

44:45.508 --> 44:48.809
Oh honey, I am no duchess.

44:48.845 --> 44:50.478
I don't understand.

44:50.513 --> 44:52.713
Of course you wouldn't, Rapunzel.

44:52.749 --> 44:55.616
But try to follow along.

44:55.652 --> 44:58.719
This is all your fault.

44:58.755 --> 44:59.820
What?

44:59.856 --> 45:03.624
You see, after your
untimely disappearance,

45:03.660 --> 45:06.827
Your father locked up every
criminal in the kingdom,

45:06.863 --> 45:09.697
including a simple petty thief.

45:09.732 --> 45:11.866
My father...

45:11.901 --> 45:13.734
I saw him thrown into a cage

45:13.770 --> 45:15.570
and hauled off like some animal,

45:15.638 --> 45:16.837
never to be seen again.

45:17.907 --> 45:20.875
So, I thought I'd come back

45:20.910 --> 45:22.643
and return the favor.

45:28.718 --> 45:30.585
Load 'em up, boys.

45:34.958 --> 45:37.692
Your turn, Your Majesty.

45:38.928 --> 45:40.628
Oh come now,

45:40.663 --> 45:44.865
you didn't think we'd leave our
prized pig in the pen, did you?

45:44.901 --> 45:46.467
Dad?

45:46.502 --> 45:47.635
Rapunzel, stay back.

45:47.670 --> 45:49.804
- But...
- No. There's nothing you can do.

45:49.839 --> 45:53.641
As your father and your king,
I command you to stay put.

45:55.945 --> 45:58.946
Don't be a hero, pretty boy.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.592
Sorry, Dad...

46:11.628 --> 46:13.494
I can't stay put.

46:13.529 --> 46:14.862
Rapunzel!

46:27.644 --> 46:29.443
That's my girl!

46:29.479 --> 46:31.812
Let them go!

46:37.553 --> 46:39.920
It's amazing what
you can hide under those wigs,

46:39.956 --> 46:41.622
isn't it, Princess.

46:41.658 --> 46:43.924
Come on, let's move out!

46:50.566 --> 46:52.833
Ugh, now you're just making me angry.

46:52.869 --> 46:55.736
Good, because I'm just getting started.

46:57.974 --> 47:01.609
Get those people back here, now!

47:01.644 --> 47:03.577
Rapunzel, your hair!

47:03.613 --> 47:04.845
I know, we'll talk about it later.

47:04.881 --> 47:07.748
Please get somewhere safe
and take care of Mom.

47:07.784 --> 47:09.817
- Rapunzel!
- That's my cue...

47:09.852 --> 47:11.519
Yeah!

47:11.554 --> 47:13.688
Well, my last day on princess duty.

47:13.723 --> 47:15.556
Might as well go down fighting.

47:21.531 --> 47:22.863
Leave them alone.

47:27.570 --> 47:28.903
So, you sure you can handle yourself?

47:28.938 --> 47:30.571
Oh, I'll manage.

47:37.647 --> 47:39.847
Get that door open, now!

47:59.902 --> 48:02.570
Aw... cute.

48:23.559 --> 48:24.625
Rapunzel!

48:38.541 --> 48:39.607
Thanks, blondie.

48:51.590 --> 48:53.857
Haha! Now this feels good.

49:08.607 --> 49:10.540
Stay down!

49:12.578 --> 49:15.579
You have no idea
who you are dealing with.

49:15.614 --> 49:18.448
Believe me, I've dealt with much worse.

49:21.787 --> 49:23.520
You think this is over?

49:23.555 --> 49:25.655
Ha! I promise you,

49:25.691 --> 49:26.857
I'll be back.

49:28.727 --> 49:30.660
Oh... Lady Caine.

49:30.696 --> 49:32.629
It's impolite to leave
in the middle of a party.

49:32.664 --> 49:35.432
You think you'd know that.

49:46.678 --> 49:48.678
Nice to see ya. Thanks for coming!

49:48.714 --> 49:49.880
Nice suit, buddy.

49:49.915 --> 49:51.648
Happy Coronation Day folks.

50:03.862 --> 50:06.863
So I'm trying to understand this.

50:06.899 --> 50:08.832
You snuck out last night

50:08.867 --> 50:10.867
went beyond the walls of Corona,

50:10.903 --> 50:13.904
where you touched a mysterious rock,

50:13.939 --> 50:17.574
that somehow caused your hair to return?

50:17.609 --> 50:18.775
Yes.

50:18.811 --> 50:20.677
And you acted alone?

50:20.712 --> 50:22.813
Look, I know you're angry,

50:22.848 --> 50:25.715
but can't you see? I'm okay!

50:25.751 --> 50:27.617
I'm more than okay, I...

50:27.653 --> 50:29.820
Rapunzel...

50:31.790 --> 50:33.690
There's something I need to tell you.

50:34.893 --> 50:36.560
I love you.

50:38.530 --> 50:41.531
The night you were taken,
a part of me died,

50:41.567 --> 50:43.500
the best part of me.

50:43.535 --> 50:46.903
For 18 long and agonizing years I swore

50:46.939 --> 50:50.640
that if somehow,
someway, by some miracle

50:50.676 --> 50:54.611
the fates decided to show mercy
and return you to me,

50:54.646 --> 50:57.714
I would never let anything
happen to you again.

50:57.749 --> 50:59.950
And now that this has returned,

50:59.985 --> 51:03.787
the very reason you were snatched
away from me in the first place,

51:03.822 --> 51:06.857
I'm afraid I'm left
with no choice, sweetheart.

51:09.661 --> 51:10.760
As of tonight,

51:10.796 --> 51:13.497
I'm forced to exercise
my martial right as king

51:13.532 --> 51:16.500
to forbid you from leaving the walls
of this kingdom without my consent.

51:16.535 --> 51:18.502
- Father!
- And know this...

51:18.537 --> 51:21.738
This is the last we will
speak of mystical rocks

51:21.773 --> 51:24.841
or magic of any kind to anyone.

51:24.877 --> 51:26.510
Is that understood?

51:27.679 --> 51:30.714
There is so much more
to me than you think.

51:45.697 --> 51:46.930
Come in.

51:46.965 --> 51:50.700
I believe somebody ordered room service?

51:50.736 --> 51:53.870
Eugene, how did you know?

51:53.906 --> 51:56.573
Ah, I had a feeling.

51:56.608 --> 51:58.575
Look, I just wanted
to clear some stuff up.

51:59.945 --> 52:01.745
I haven't had a chance to apologize for

52:01.780 --> 52:04.514
putting you on the spot
with that proposal.

52:04.550 --> 52:06.750
Well looking back,
storming out of the room

52:06.785 --> 52:09.819
probably wasn't the best reaction.

52:09.855 --> 52:13.623
So I'm sorry.

52:13.659 --> 52:15.926
No, don't apologize.

52:15.961 --> 52:19.896
Look I'll admit, I don't quite
understand why you said "no."

52:19.932 --> 52:23.934
But I promise to do
everything I can until I do.

52:25.537 --> 52:26.670
Thanks, Eugene.

52:26.705 --> 52:28.538
In the mean time,

52:28.574 --> 52:31.875
we'll stay right here
and take things slowly.

52:31.910 --> 52:33.743
I miss this.

52:35.514 --> 52:37.781
Hey, promise me one more thing.

52:37.816 --> 52:38.915
Anything.

52:38.951 --> 52:41.851
That you'll be patient with me.

52:41.887 --> 52:43.820
Absolutely.

52:45.557 --> 52:46.723
Good night, Rapunzel.

52:46.758 --> 52:48.525
