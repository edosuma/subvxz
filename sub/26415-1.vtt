00:34.975 --> 00:38.176
(Chainsaw revving)

00:45.709 --> 00:58.839
(scared mumbling)

00:58.841 --> 01:00.842
(Frightened shouting)

01:08.840 --> 01:10.939
Pull it out!

01:10.941 --> 01:12.942
C'mon, you're not doing it
right!

01:18.609 --> 01:20.608
He can't breathe! (Laughter)

01:22.008 --> 01:24.209
You're hurting me! You're
hurting me!

01:24.441 --> 01:27.905
Hey, I'm fucking serious! I'm
serious, I'm fucking done here!

01:27.907 --> 01:31.405
We'll talk about you going home
after you stop fucking breathing!

01:31.407 --> 01:32.740
I want to go home.

01:32.742 --> 01:35.373
- Oh, he's scared!
- No no no, please! No!

01:35.375 --> 01:37.506
I've made a mistake, I don't
want to...

01:37.508 --> 01:40.276
(Shower noises)

02:04.807 --> 02:06.807
(dark ominous music)

02:28.441 --> 02:30.375
(phone ringing)

02:37.974 --> 02:38.973
Hello?

02:38.975 --> 02:41.176
(voice distorted)
Can you be ready tomorrow?

02:41.374 --> 02:42.406
Yes.

02:42.408 --> 02:44.575
Good. Your mission awaits you.

02:49.474 --> 02:51.475
(Highway sounds)

02:58.374 --> 03:00.375
(dark ominous music)

04:00.241 --> 04:02.241
(Radio Man 1)
I 100% agree with you.

04:03.773 --> 04:07.472
(Radio Man 2) (overlapped talking)
why we like physical media so much

04:07.474 --> 04:09.771
is in that era, which we've
lost,

04:09.773 --> 04:13.772
whether you were the big budget
Hollywood multimillion dollar movie

04:13.774 --> 04:16.774
or the super low budget Roger
Corman film...

04:19.475 --> 04:21.476
(Phone ringing)

04:23.773 --> 04:24.771
Hi.

04:24.773 --> 04:27.175
(Erica on phone)
Allie? Thank God! Where are you?

04:27.574 --> 04:29.508
Don't worry, I'm fine.

04:29.774 --> 04:31.838
(Erica on phone) No, listen to me.
You're not fine!

04:31.840 --> 04:35.738
I know exactly what I'm doing.
You just have to trust me.

04:35.740 --> 04:38.838
(Erica on phone) I don't know if I can trust
you, because you're off your medication.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.742
(Erica on phone)
I know you are.

04:41.274 --> 04:43.473
(pills rattling in bottle) I've
got them right here.

04:43.475 --> 04:45.476
(Erica on phone)
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

04:45.740 --> 04:49.941
(Erica on phone) I didn't mean for it
to go so far. Just come home, please?

04:52.773 --> 04:56.208
I love you. Okay?

04:56.841 --> 04:59.875
I know I've never said that
before, but I do.

05:00.573 --> 05:02.574
I wanna be deserving of you.

05:02.773 --> 05:04.774
You have nothing to be scared
of.

05:05.573 --> 05:09.607
I'm the one who's scared. I'm the one
who's been scared for so many years.

05:09.807 --> 05:11.342
Not after today.

05:12.741 --> 05:14.738
(Erica on phone) Allie, just stop.
Wherever you are, just turn ar...

05:14.740 --> 05:16.741
(Allie hangs up phone)

05:58.506 --> 06:00.507
(car engine shuts off)

06:02.375 --> 06:06.405
My name is Allison Bell. I'm making this video
as a stipulation before entering Perdition.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.939
I cannot say where I am, but I can say
that I am here of my own free will.

06:09.941 --> 06:13.305
Anything that happens inside Perdition
is done with my full consent.

06:13.307 --> 06:18.439
I release Perdition and it's staff of any
responsibility for whatever may occur during my visit.

06:18.441 --> 06:19.440
(Allie hangs up phone)

06:19.442 --> 06:21.442
(Phone rings)

06:22.774 --> 06:24.305
I'm here.

06:24.307 --> 06:27.705
(The Voice) Leave your phone and keys
in the car. The back door is unlocked.

06:27.707 --> 06:33.841
Proceed to the ladies' room, you'll find a
release form there. Sign it. (hangs up)

06:49.841 --> 06:51.972
(Girl)
God, this place is a shithole.

06:51.974 --> 06:53.972
(Zachary)
Yeah, I think that's the point.

06:53.974 --> 06:56.474
(Girl) I'm so fucking jealous
I didn't get picked.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.972
(Zachary)
I'll call you when I'm done.

06:58.974 --> 07:01.175
(Girl)
Love you.

07:05.506 --> 07:07.706
(Zachary) Fucking wicked, huh?
(Allison) Yeah.

07:07.708 --> 07:09.340
(Zachary)
So this is it?

07:09.342 --> 07:10.871
(Allison)
I think so.

07:10.873 --> 07:12.874
(Zachary) Zachary.
(Allison) Allison.

07:15.341 --> 07:17.341
(Zachary)
Let the fun begin.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.742
(Zachary) I can taste
the asbestos already.

07:34.407 --> 07:36.407
There's a light down here.

07:44.974 --> 07:46.806
You ever do this before?

07:46.808 --> 07:48.808
No, you?

07:49.374 --> 07:51.539
First time.

07:51.541 --> 07:53.472
(Allison)
I'm supposed to go in there.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.839
How do you know?

07:54.841 --> 07:56.842
He told me.

08:00.874 --> 08:02.874
Wow.

08:17.807 --> 08:19.807
Shouldn't you read that first?

08:20.275 --> 08:22.276
What's the fun in that?

08:47.807 --> 08:49.541
(gags)

08:49.841 --> 08:52.240
Oh, I'm not doing that.

08:52.242 --> 08:53.475
(scoffs)

08:54.407 --> 08:56.408
I will.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.542
Oh Jesus, it's real.

09:07.007 --> 09:09.208
(Zachary gagging)

09:22.873 --> 09:24.874
(Zachary retching)

09:29.608 --> 09:31.607
(stall door closing)

09:36.974 --> 09:39.175
What is it?

09:50.774 --> 09:52.775
(Allison)
Put these on.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.508
Cute.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.672
How do I look?

10:23.674 --> 10:25.642
(Laughter)

10:26.640 --> 10:28.274
(Door opens)

10:29.274 --> 10:31.275
(Zachary) Get off of me!
(Allison) No!

10:31.608 --> 10:33.608
(Zachary) Get off of me!
(Allison screams)

10:37.673 --> 10:39.674
(ominous electronic music)

10:43.641 --> 10:45.642
(Zachary)
Just watch it, alright?

10:46.407 --> 10:48.408
Easy, buddy.

10:48.641 --> 10:50.642
Fuck you, man!

11:10.574 --> 11:15.872
(Erica) Somebody please help me!
She's dying, I need your help!

11:15.874 --> 11:18.441
Oh my God! Come on baby!

11:19.608 --> 11:21.608
(Therapist)
Do you know why you're here?

11:23.841 --> 11:27.871
Because female maintenance puts me
in close proximity to razor blades?

11:27.873 --> 11:32.372
(Therapist) Yes. That is why you
are here at this very moment.

11:32.374 --> 11:36.272
But why are you back here, after
all these years?

11:36.274 --> 11:38.805
I don't know how you want me to
answer that.

11:38.807 --> 11:41.941
Because I'm fucked up? I don't
know.

11:42.841 --> 11:47.372
You have unresolved issues. No
one can blame you for that.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.504
But if you don't want to end up
back here, or worse,

11:51.506 --> 11:53.807
you have to deal with them. Head
on.

12:16.407 --> 12:18.706
(Zachary) What the fuck
are they doing? Where-

12:18.708 --> 12:20.708
(Allison)
Shh. I can't hear.

12:32.507 --> 12:35.341
(Reporter speaking excitedly in
Japanese)

12:44.440 --> 12:46.440
(alarm blaring)

13:07.674 --> 13:09.675
(reporter continues in Japanese)

13:17.974 --> 13:23.674
(altered voice over speakers) Your
souls belong to Perdition now.

13:35.507 --> 13:39.508
(White Skull)
Sit down. Sit the fuck down!

13:39.840 --> 13:41.842
Stay.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.742
Good little doggy! (laughs)

14:14.940 --> 14:16.942
(ominous violins)

14:20.440 --> 14:23.474
(The Voice)
Welcome... to Perdition.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.942
Am I being videotaped right
now?

14:26.506 --> 14:30.340
(The Voice) You've seen our videos.
Of course you are.

14:30.573 --> 14:34.905
Every moment of your experience
is being documented.

14:34.907 --> 14:38.905
So those Chinese people... is that
what they're here for?

14:38.907 --> 14:41.906
(The Voice) They're Japanese.
And they're from

14:41.908 --> 14:45.571
Gashadokuro, you will treat
them with the utmost respect.

14:45.573 --> 14:47.575
So is the world gonna see this?

14:48.708 --> 14:50.707
(The Voice)
I chose you for this night.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.175
So consider it an honor.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.407
Why are you here?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.771
I told you in my interview.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.474
(The Voice)
No, you told me what scares you.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.471
That's not what I'm asking.

15:02.473 --> 15:04.774
I have unresolved issues.

15:05.541 --> 15:07.808
A fear. A darkness.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.607
And you want us to what?

15:10.874 --> 15:12.871
Literally scare the hell out of
you?

15:12.873 --> 15:14.571
I guess.

15:14.573 --> 15:17.307
Any moron can scare you. It's
easy.

15:17.507 --> 15:19.607
(loud horn)

15:21.507 --> 15:23.538
Is that was this is gonna be?

15:23.540 --> 15:27.940
Cheap tricks? Because that's gonna
get really boring really fast

15:28.540 --> 15:30.542
Boring?

15:31.373 --> 15:33.906
You have no idea where you are
right now.

15:33.908 --> 15:34.972
No one does.

15:34.974 --> 15:38.774
We could be dangerous people.
Could be killers.

15:39.474 --> 15:40.606
(scoffs)
Really?

15:40.608 --> 15:42.972
You have a website and a YouTube
channel.

15:42.974 --> 15:45.341
How dangerous can you be?

15:45.973 --> 15:48.539
I will be many things.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.542
But boring will not be one of
them.

15:51.306 --> 15:53.439
Masks don't scare me.

15:53.441 --> 15:55.941
Oh, we all wear masks,
Allison.

15:56.708 --> 15:57.905
Even you.

15:57.907 --> 16:00.808
It's what's underneath that
scares us.

16:05.641 --> 16:07.640
(metallic knock)

16:11.506 --> 16:13.508
(keys tapping)

16:17.307 --> 16:19.870
(The Voice on recording)
What scares you, Allison?

16:19.872 --> 16:21.638
(Allison on recording)
I don't know if things scare me.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.471
(The Voice) Maybe I'm not being clear.
What limits you?

16:24.473 --> 16:26.475
What holds you back from living?

16:27.307 --> 16:29.404
I'm extremely claustrophobic?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.641
(The Voice) Lots of people
hate small spaces, Allison.

16:32.474 --> 16:35.674
It's like being afraid of the
dark, or spiders.

16:36.407 --> 16:38.642
Unless it comes from a real
trauma.

16:39.574 --> 16:41.542
What else?

16:42.340 --> 16:46.871
(Allison) This might sound
weird, but..winter.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.272
(The Voice)
You're scared of the winter?

16:49.274 --> 16:51.372
(Allison)
No, I'm not scared of winter.

16:51.374 --> 16:53.375
But it reminds me of my
childhood.

16:54.741 --> 16:57.575
And I don't like to remember my
childhood.

16:58.641 --> 17:00.504
(The Voice)
Too many bad memories?

17:00.506 --> 17:02.507
(Allison)
Yeah, you could say that.

17:20.641 --> 17:22.608
(clearing throat)

17:30.907 --> 17:33.475
(scary ambient sounds)

18:00.840 --> 18:02.807
(groaning sounds)

18:06.406 --> 18:08.407
Hello?

18:09.907 --> 18:11.908
(crunching sound)

18:12.541 --> 18:14.004
Who's in here?

18:14.006 --> 18:16.207
(growling)

18:22.474 --> 18:24.474
Who's there?!

18:26.574 --> 18:28.575
I'm not scared of you!

18:40.274 --> 18:43.541
(Red Skull) The darkness
fucks with your mind.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.770
It plays tricks on the mind.

18:45.772 --> 18:47.773
It doesn't take long.

18:48.474 --> 18:52.675
(speaking Japanese)

18:53.707 --> 18:55.505
(translator) Tonight, you
have two people going

18:55.507 --> 18:58.275
through Perdition:
Zachary and Allison.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.707
Why did you choose them,
specifically?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.307
All I can say is you'll see.

19:03.507 --> 19:05.938
It was a decision I came to very
carefully.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.004
And after tonight, people will
be talking

19:08.006 --> 19:11.340
about their visit for a very
long time.

19:16.007 --> 19:18.238
(ominous violins)

19:18.240 --> 19:20.240
(creaking sounds)

19:23.607 --> 19:25.607
(whispers)

19:37.641 --> 19:39.641
(doorknob rattles)

19:43.340 --> 19:45.340
(ominous whispers)

19:50.541 --> 19:52.541
(loud bang, doorknob rattles)

19:55.974 --> 19:58.175
(Allison screams)

19:58.373 --> 20:00.374
(sinister laughter)

20:09.241 --> 20:11.241
(White Skull)
Repeat after me:

20:12.340 --> 20:16.275
"I belong to Perdition now!"

20:17.241 --> 20:20.271
(Zachary and Allison)
I belong to Perdition now.

20:20.273 --> 20:22.274
I relinquish all control

20:22.973 --> 20:26.440
of my mind and my body

20:26.773 --> 20:28.937
to Perdition.

20:28.939 --> 20:31.439
I relinquish all control of

20:31.441 --> 20:33.441
my mind and my body

20:33.907 --> 20:35.175
to Perdition.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.438
(White Skull)
I am nothing now.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.404
I'm just a plaything

20:39.406 --> 20:41.407
of Perdition.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.238
I am nothing now.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.870
I'm just a plaything

20:46.872 --> 20:48.873
of Perdition.

20:50.340 --> 20:54.340
(White Skull)
Do with me whatever you wish.

20:55.907 --> 20:59.837
(Zachary and Allison)
Do with me whatever you wish.

20:59.839 --> 21:01.838
With enthusiasm!

21:01.840 --> 21:04.508
Do with me whatever you wish!

21:07.607 --> 21:09.606
Now take off your clothes.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.670
What?

21:11.672 --> 21:14.307
(scoff)
No.

21:16.407 --> 21:18.407
Take off your clothes!

21:18.973 --> 21:21.174
No.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.940
(Door opens)

21:27.006 --> 21:29.207
(intense drum starts)

21:29.640 --> 21:31.641
(Allison)
You bitch!

21:43.373 --> 21:45.374
(Zachary)
Alright!

21:45.639 --> 21:49.474
(White Skull) Well, you don't wanna do
it yourself, I gotta do it for you!

21:55.572 --> 21:57.573
(White Skull)
Put those on.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.274
(Red Skull)
Take off everything.

22:00.707 --> 22:03.874
(White Skull)
Take off the goddamn underwear.

22:04.373 --> 22:06.340
(intense drum beat resumes)

22:08.806 --> 22:10.806
All of it.

22:15.273 --> 22:17.274
Now put those on.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.506
See, that wasn't so hard, now
was it?

22:25.273 --> 22:27.274
(crow cawing)

22:30.306 --> 22:32.307
(phone ringing)

22:50.306 --> 22:52.541
Babe. Not right now.

22:52.740 --> 22:55.805
(Erica) Just keep reading.
I won't bother you.

22:55.807 --> 22:56.738
(kissing)

22:56.740 --> 22:58.774
Seriously, I don't feel like it.
I'm sorry.

22:59.607 --> 23:01.637
Don't do this to me.

23:01.639 --> 23:03.640
I'm not asking for much.

23:04.706 --> 23:06.871
I'm in love with an android.

23:06.873 --> 23:08.607
Don't be a bitch.

23:08.806 --> 23:10.806
Two months we haven't had sex.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.540
Does that sound normal to you?

23:14.673 --> 23:17.574
We're young. We have our own
place.

23:18.573 --> 23:21.239
We could be doing it all day,
every day,

23:21.241 --> 23:23.241
but I'm not asking for that.

23:23.441 --> 23:26.441
I'm just asking for a little bit
of passion.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.341
Occasionally.

23:30.772 --> 23:32.840
Not once in a quarter.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.439
(kissing)

23:41.340 --> 23:42.671
Don't! Get off me!

23:42.673 --> 23:44.673
What the fuck?

23:45.806 --> 23:47.806
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
Listen, I get it.

23:53.707 --> 23:55.870
You don't have to explain
yourself to me.

23:55.872 --> 23:57.873
You know it's not you.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.175
I know.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.274
Still doesn't make it easy.

24:10.374 --> 24:11.841
(Erica)
I'm gonna go out.

24:19.807 --> 24:22.407
(muffled sexual moans)

24:33.806 --> 24:35.806
(Skull Clown)
You move you die.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.340
(door locks)

24:40.772 --> 24:42.773
(muffled sexual moans continue)

24:46.540 --> 24:50.941
(Red Skull) You love your girlfriend,
but her touch disgusts you.

24:51.973 --> 24:53.339
(Allison on recording)
No.

24:53.341 --> 24:54.341
(Red Skull)
No?

24:55.306 --> 24:58.439
Well, it's touch itself that
disgusts you.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.174
One of our basic needs as
humans.

25:01.606 --> 25:03.506
(electronic sliding door
opening)

25:18.973 --> 25:21.174
(electronic beeps)

25:21.840 --> 25:23.841
(Peep Show Girl) Don't be shy.

25:39.273 --> 25:40.638
(man)
Hey.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.937
(man)
did you cut yourself?

25:41.939 --> 25:43.737
(Peep Show Girl)
Just give in.

25:43.739 --> 25:45.740
I know you want to.

25:50.739 --> 25:52.737
(Peep Show Girl)
If you don't,

25:52.739 --> 25:54.740
something bad's gonna happen.

26:03.540 --> 26:05.907
(electronic cutting noise)

26:11.640 --> 26:13.640
(beeping)

26:19.472 --> 26:21.439
(sexual moaning)

26:29.840 --> 26:31.841
(Allison gasps)

26:35.539 --> 26:37.571
Stop!

26:37.573 --> 26:39.574
(Skull Clown)
(sinister laughter)

26:43.505 --> 26:45.940
(Skull Clown) (Laughing)
Night Night! You're next!

26:49.506 --> 26:51.506
(heavy breathing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:55.472 --> 26:57.504
(over intercom Zachary being
hurt)

26:57.506 --> 26:58.638
(Zachary)
Allison!

26:58.640 --> 27:01.474
(Peep Show Girl) Just do what I
do, or you'll suffer.

27:02.673 --> 27:04.674
You both will.

27:06.672 --> 27:08.673
(pleasured moaning)

27:10.806 --> 27:12.806
(strange noises in background)

27:35.506 --> 27:37.506
(Allison)
Stop!

27:37.840 --> 27:38.841
Stop.

27:39.673 --> 27:40.674
No!

27:42.272 --> 27:42.940
(gasping)
Stop.

27:43.773 --> 27:45.806
(Skull Clown)
(menacing laughter)

27:49.872 --> 27:51.873
(Skull Clown)
(heavy breathing)

28:39.740 --> 28:41.740
(Peep Show Girl)
Look at me!

28:44.672 --> 28:46.673
Are you ready?

28:56.372 --> 28:58.373
(female moaning)

29:03.939 --> 29:05.908
(female scream)

29:18.373 --> 29:20.374
(door unlocking)

29:24.406 --> 29:26.407
(speaking Japanese)

29:29.740 --> 29:32.740
(translator) Would you
allow us to see your face?

29:37.639 --> 29:39.640
(ominous string music)

29:49.440 --> 29:51.439
(speaking Japanese)

30:10.506 --> 30:12.240
(speaking Japanese)

30:41.505 --> 30:43.506
(car starting)

30:56.472 --> 30:57.473
(engine stops)

31:05.272 --> 31:06.403
(strange electronic music)

31:06.405 --> 31:08.406
(Reporter speaking Japanese)

31:24.506 --> 31:26.507
(dog barking)

31:31.540 --> 31:34.274
You told me there weren't gonna
be any dogs!

31:34.972 --> 31:38.207
(Red Skull) And for some reason,
you believed us.

31:38.573 --> 31:40.573
First one to find the exit wins.

31:41.406 --> 31:42.403
Believe me.

31:42.405 --> 31:43.473
(creepy moan)

31:43.673 --> 31:45.673
you don't want to lose.

31:46.006 --> 31:48.207
Twenty second head start, kids.

31:48.872 --> 31:50.206
Dog follows.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.270
Get going.

31:52.272 --> 31:54.304
(horn blowing)

31:54.306 --> 31:56.306
(alarm wailing)

32:21.740 --> 32:23.740
(horn blowing)

32:26.938 --> 32:29.741
(Allison) Hey! Wait!

32:38.473 --> 32:40.473
(muffled emergency broadcast)

32:53.405 --> 32:54.506
Zachary!

32:56.239 --> 32:58.239
(White Skull shrieking)

33:13.439 --> 33:15.439
(dog barking in distance)

33:28.740 --> 33:32.207
(White Skull) Help me! Help me,
help me, help me!

33:39.272 --> 33:41.273
(dog growling)

34:00.640 --> 34:02.640
(dog barking)

34:15.639 --> 34:17.641
(dog whimpering)

34:42.505 --> 34:44.507
Looks like Zachary won.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.607
And so, he'll be rewarded.

34:49.306 --> 34:51.306
Which means you lose.

34:52.472 --> 34:54.473
(uptempo electronic music)

34:55.804 --> 34:57.870
(Monkey Suit)
It's a madhouse!

34:57.872 --> 35:00.003
Say it! Say it!

35:00.005 --> 35:02.339
It's a madhouse! It's a fucking
madhouse!

35:02.540 --> 35:04.541
Say it! Say it!

35:07.938 --> 35:09.304
(cheerful asian music)

35:09.306 --> 35:11.307
(reporter speaking Japanese)

35:27.872 --> 35:29.873
(sinister laughing)

35:30.906 --> 35:32.907
(clown scream)

35:38.771 --> 35:40.772
(terrified) No! No!

35:41.372 --> 35:43.374
No, no, no! Please, no!

35:43.573 --> 35:45.471
No, I promise I'll be good!

35:45.473 --> 35:47.474
No, I can't! No!

35:48.372 --> 35:50.936
(Red Skull) It's exactly why
you're going to.

35:50.938 --> 35:52.307
Please! Please!

35:54.439 --> 35:56.471
(Allison) No!

35:56.473 --> 35:58.474
Shhh.

35:58.972 --> 36:01.339
(young Allison) Dad! Let me out,
please!

36:01.905 --> 36:03.869
Let me out, I promise I'll be
good!

36:03.871 --> 36:05.872
Dad! No! Please!

36:06.606 --> 36:08.571
(Red Skull) The more you scream,

36:08.573 --> 36:10.574
the worse it gets.

36:11.273 --> 36:13.274
That, I promise you.

36:13.973 --> 36:16.174
(scared whisper) No, no.

36:16.939 --> 36:17.873
No!

36:18.671 --> 36:20.673
(terrified screaming)

36:24.005 --> 36:26.303
Let me out!

36:26.305 --> 36:28.307
(pounding on coffin)

36:34.339 --> 36:36.339
(ominous heavy metal music)

36:54.339 --> 36:56.339
(stabbing)

36:56.706 --> 36:58.703
What the hell is this?

36:58.705 --> 36:59.838
(Allison) It's Jack Rabe's new
movie.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.541
That underground filmmaker from
Ohio I told you about?

37:07.872 --> 37:09.873
(screaming on TV)

37:11.705 --> 37:13.804
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:13.806 --> 37:14.873
What?

37:15.672 --> 37:17.370
(Allison) Geez, it's just a
movie.

37:17.372 --> 37:18.406
Is it?

37:18.805 --> 37:20.503
(Allison) Yes, Erica.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.403
Watching horror doesn't make me
deranged,

37:22.405 --> 37:23.704
which is how you make me feel.

37:23.706 --> 37:25.907
This isn't horror. This is
different.

37:26.706 --> 37:29.605
And when you go after dark shit
like this...

37:31.306 --> 37:33.307
I've seen it happen before.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.673
I'm only trying to help, okay?

37:38.906 --> 37:40.603
(Allison) I don't need your
help.

37:40.605 --> 37:42.303
Do you wanna end up back in the
hospital?

37:42.305 --> 37:43.903
Is that what you want?

37:43.905 --> 37:45.636
(Erica) This is fucking dark
shit, Allie.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.872
Rape, torture, beheadings?

37:48.938 --> 37:49.971
What are you doing?

37:49.973 --> 37:51.303
- Put those down!
- I am!

37:51.305 --> 37:53.307
(Allison)
Quit being a fucking bitch!

37:56.772 --> 37:58.640
Get your fucking hands off me!

38:02.472 --> 38:04.474
Please don't go!

38:05.273 --> 38:07.304
(Allison screaming)

38:07.306 --> 38:09.307
Let me out!

38:12.339 --> 38:14.306
(heavy metal music)

38:24.605 --> 38:26.605
(Woman)
Help me! Help me!

38:37.473 --> 38:38.739
(Masked Man)
Let's just do it.

38:38.939 --> 38:40.940
Let's just do it. You're so
beautiful.

38:42.405 --> 38:44.406
- Help me.
- I need.

38:53.472 --> 38:55.439
(Woman screaming)

38:59.905 --> 39:01.907
(stabbing and squelching)

39:05.973 --> 39:08.174
(heavy metal music on radio)

39:15.639 --> 39:17.640
(phone ringing)

39:20.273 --> 39:21.340
Hello?

39:22.439 --> 39:23.872
(Red Skull)
Hello, Allison.

39:24.739 --> 39:25.904
Hi.

39:25.906 --> 39:28.840
(Red Skull) I just finished
watching your submission.

39:29.705 --> 39:31.672
I think you're an excellent
candidate.

39:32.872 --> 39:34.240
Really?

39:35.871 --> 39:36.771
That's great.

39:37.905 --> 39:39.937
(Red Skull)
I need a letter from your doctor

39:39.939 --> 39:41.940
stating you're in good mental
and physical condition.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.374
Can you do this?

39:44.972 --> 39:47.173
Yeah. That's no problem.

39:49.340 --> 39:51.339
(Red Skull)
What scares you, Allison?

39:54.340 --> 39:56.340
I don't know if things scare me.

39:56.806 --> 39:58.806
(Red Skull)
Maybe I'm not being clear.

39:59.805 --> 40:01.339
What limits you?

40:01.772 --> 40:04.270
What holds you back from living?

40:04.272 --> 40:06.274
(slow piano jazz music)

40:11.505 --> 40:14.636
(Therapist) I went to the website
of this Perdition place.

40:14.638 --> 40:15.736
Checked it out.

40:15.738 --> 40:17.736
Honestly, Allison,

40:17.738 --> 40:20.572
I don't see any therapeutic
value in it.

40:21.373 --> 40:23.371
Now, you asked me to look at the
website,

40:23.373 --> 40:25.374
consider this as a therapy
option.

40:25.973 --> 40:27.436
I looked at it.

40:27.438 --> 40:29.438
I read everything on that
website,

40:29.906 --> 40:31.907
and I have considered this
carefully.

40:32.439 --> 40:34.439
My answer is no.

40:34.973 --> 40:37.174
I strongly urge you not to go.

40:38.605 --> 40:41.604
And I absolutely cannot write
you a letter

40:41.606 --> 40:43.206
of mental health.

40:45.672 --> 40:47.936
You have made significant
progress

40:47.938 --> 40:50.003
over the past decade in the wake

40:50.005 --> 40:52.640
of traumatic events in your
life.

40:53.938 --> 40:56.271
You've moved back into the
world.

40:56.273 --> 40:57.537
You have an apartment,

40:57.539 --> 40:59.636
you're in a good relationship.

40:59.638 --> 41:01.669
Don't throw it all away

41:01.671 --> 41:03.536
over a dumb haunted house.

41:03.538 --> 41:04.805
(Allison)
It's not dumb.

41:05.404 --> 41:06.539
It's what I want.

41:06.805 --> 41:07.839
It's what I need.

41:09.871 --> 41:12.239
This infatuation with horror

41:12.471 --> 41:14.370
has the potential to derail

41:14.372 --> 41:15.740
all your progress.

41:16.372 --> 41:18.605
Horror is no better than
pornography.

41:18.972 --> 41:20.337
It's smut,

41:20.339 --> 41:21.805
dressed up as entertainment.

41:22.371 --> 41:24.605
It serves no greater purpose.

41:25.371 --> 41:27.572
It's death, on sale.

41:28.539 --> 41:30.540
And on sale cheap.

41:35.738 --> 41:37.740
(Therapist)
Allison?

41:39.939 --> 41:41.206
Allison?

41:42.239 --> 41:43.273
Allison?

41:45.438 --> 41:46.470
I'm going to forget we

41:46.472 --> 41:48.273
ever had this conversation.

41:49.339 --> 41:51.539
Do I have to schedule another
evaluation?

41:52.273 --> 41:54.473
(Allison)
No, Dr. Nicholas, we don't.

41:55.005 --> 41:56.207
Okay.

41:56.572 --> 41:58.436
You forget about this.

41:58.438 --> 42:00.004
You'll thank me.

42:00.006 --> 42:01.839
(Allison knocking on coffin
door)

42:12.305 --> 42:13.306
(Allison screams)

42:27.240 --> 42:28.640
(Creature growling)

42:28.906 --> 42:30.907
(Allison)
Leave me alone!

42:56.739 --> 42:58.706
(Hainey)
The dog's alive! Yeah!

42:58.938 --> 43:01.338
John Hainey, thirty-eight years
old.

43:02.239 --> 43:04.906
Been with Perdition for... geez.

43:05.438 --> 43:07.537
Going on ten years now.

43:07.539 --> 43:08.640
This is Russell.

43:10.973 --> 43:12.438
This is pretty boy, Floyd.

43:12.639 --> 43:13.504
Prop gun.

43:13.506 --> 43:15.673
I used to work in special makeup
effects.

43:15.973 --> 43:17.636
Underground films, mostly.

43:17.638 --> 43:18.706
(speaking Japanese)

43:19.672 --> 43:20.769
(translator)
You play how many characters?

43:20.771 --> 43:21.570
Three.

43:21.572 --> 43:24.240
Beanie, Psycho Clown, and
Gorilla.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.536
Now, the Gorilla is obviously
the one closest

43:26.538 --> 43:27.803
to my own personality.

43:27.805 --> 43:28.869
When I first started,

43:28.871 --> 43:30.536
I was what we call White Skull.

43:30.538 --> 43:31.903
That's the entry-level position.

43:31.905 --> 43:33.173
Mainly grunt work.

43:33.571 --> 43:34.603
But after a year of that,

43:34.605 --> 43:36.302
I graduated character work.

43:36.304 --> 43:37.971
This gives me more of an
opportunity

43:37.973 --> 43:39.540
to express myself artistically.

43:47.472 --> 43:48.806
(speaking Japanese)

43:49.238 --> 43:50.171
(translator)
Tell us your name.

43:50.173 --> 43:52.306
Phil Cutter. Been with Perdition
ten years.

43:53.372 --> 43:54.903
(translator) What made you
want to scare people?

43:54.905 --> 43:56.470
(Cutter)
I served eight tours,

43:56.472 --> 43:58.236
Iraq and Afghanistan,

43:58.238 --> 44:00.336
and uh saw some bad shit,

44:00.338 --> 44:02.173
and this is therapy for me.

44:04.571 --> 44:05.769
(translator)
How did you meet Bob?

44:05.771 --> 44:07.336
(Cutter)
He was a struggling screenwriter

44:07.338 --> 44:08.503
when I met him.

44:08.505 --> 44:09.937
He was writing a Vietnam script,

44:09.939 --> 44:11.971
something for a military
advisor.

44:11.973 --> 44:14.004
He was a friend of a friend so I
helped out.

44:14.006 --> 44:16.004
The script went nowhere, but uh

44:16.006 --> 44:18.269
that was our first
collaboration,

44:18.271 --> 44:20.672
and uh, he's an interesting guy.

44:24.005 --> 44:26.672
(translator) What unique
skills do you bring Perdition?

44:29.405 --> 44:31.406
(ominous slow electronic music)

45:31.705 --> 45:33.705
What do you want from us?

45:34.805 --> 45:36.805
What?

45:39.405 --> 45:41.004
Now listen carefully.

45:41.006 --> 45:42.569
It's a simple question.

45:42.571 --> 45:44.539
What do you

45:45.671 --> 45:46.739
want from us?

45:47.872 --> 45:49.873
I don't know what you mean.

46:03.872 --> 46:05.540
What do you

46:06.371 --> 46:07.506
want from us?

46:08.006 --> 46:10.539
I want you to push me to my
limits!

46:14.439 --> 46:15.540
(scoffs)

46:17.871 --> 46:19.172
(Allison whimpers)

46:49.605 --> 46:52.273
(Zachary) What are you-what are
you doing to her?

46:53.304 --> 46:54.604
What are you doing to her?!

46:54.606 --> 46:55.639
Stop!

46:59.405 --> 47:01.470
What do you want from us,
Allison?

47:01.472 --> 47:04.639
Stop! I want you to stop!

47:06.539 --> 47:08.506
That's the wrong answer.

47:20.404 --> 47:22.004
What do you want from us,
Allison?

47:22.006 --> 47:23.839
I felt like I was drowning!

47:24.639 --> 47:25.940
You can't do this!

47:30.539 --> 47:31.837
(Zachary)
Stop it!

47:31.839 --> 47:33.903
Stop it, you're gonna kill her!

47:33.905 --> 47:35.172
(muffled groans)

47:40.339 --> 47:41.870
What do you want from us?

47:41.872 --> 47:43.337
(coughing)
I want you to make me

47:43.339 --> 47:44.603
face my fears!

47:44.605 --> 47:45.672
What fears?

48:04.005 --> 48:05.272
(sobbing)
Daddy.

48:11.438 --> 48:13.940
Stop, something's wrong with
her! Stop!

48:16.772 --> 48:18.536
Allison. Allison, listen to me!
Listen to me,

48:18.538 --> 48:20.705
you're having a panic attack,
okay?

48:21.539 --> 48:23.502
I'm gonna say a sequence of
numbers,

48:23.504 --> 48:25.670
and I want you to repeat them
back to me,

48:25.672 --> 48:26.907
do you understand?

48:27.438 --> 48:29.337
Now listen, here we go, here we
go

48:29.339 --> 48:31.336
2, 5, 4,

48:31.338 --> 48:33.472
6, 0, 8, 9.

48:34.605 --> 48:36.670
Six, oh, eight.

48:36.672 --> 48:37.673
Yeah

48:38.672 --> 48:39.873
(speaking Japanese)

48:40.605 --> 48:41.904
(translator)
What's happening?

48:41.906 --> 48:43.337
(Red Skull)
Don't worry.

48:43.339 --> 48:44.969
It's all under control.

48:44.971 --> 48:47.772
It's okay. 6, 8, 4,

48:48.238 --> 48:50.238
1, 3, 7, 2.

48:50.671 --> 48:52.672
(crying)
6, 8, 5

48:53.271 --> 48:55.273
...no, 4, 4...

48:56.906 --> 48:59.173
Calm down, calm down. it's
okay.

48:59.805 --> 49:01.870
(crying)
one

49:01.872 --> 49:03.373
(soothing sounds)

49:04.338 --> 49:06.338
Take it easy. It's alright.

49:07.839 --> 49:08.905
It's alright.

49:17.439 --> 49:18.503
Stop. Stop!

49:18.505 --> 49:20.405
Let go of me! Help!

49:20.871 --> 49:22.505
Stop! Let go!

49:23.739 --> 49:24.740
Get off of him!

49:25.605 --> 49:28.203
Why'd you say "Daddy"?

49:27.239 --> 49:28.870
Because I'm fucked up, okay?

49:28.872 --> 49:30.873
Now we're getting somewhere.

49:31.971 --> 49:33.273
Why are you here?

49:33.738 --> 49:35.570
To see what I'm capable of!

49:35.572 --> 49:36.536
Yeah, why?

49:36.538 --> 49:38.540
- 'Cause I'm afraid.
- Of what?

49:39.238 --> 49:41.236
That I'll never amount to
anything!

49:41.238 --> 49:42.171
Chill Hipster brain,

49:42.173 --> 49:43.970
come up with that shit all on
your own?

49:43.972 --> 49:45.369
- No.
- Yeah

49:45.371 --> 49:45.406
Yeah, then where'd you hear it?

49:47.605 --> 49:49.470
From my parents.

49:49.472 --> 49:51.604
Sounds like they know you pretty
well.

49:51.606 --> 49:52.939
What else they have to say?

49:53.904 --> 49:55.705
That I'm not strong enough.

49:55.938 --> 49:57.272
That I'm weak.

49:57.671 --> 49:58.872
I'm... I'm

49:59.471 --> 50:01.473
- (sobbing) a loser!
- Keep going!

50:01.938 --> 50:02.938
(Allison)
Hey!

50:03.672 --> 50:05.473
Oh, you ready to talk now?

50:06.372 --> 50:07.373
Yeah.

50:07.739 --> 50:08.740
(Cutter)
Alright.

50:10.805 --> 50:12.938
You ready to tell me what I
wanna hear?

50:15.738 --> 50:16.739
Yeah.

50:17.539 --> 50:18.706
Well I'm all ears.

50:21.339 --> 50:22.803
(Red Skull)
Oh, shit!

50:22.805 --> 50:24.805
Did you see that?

50:25.937 --> 50:26.938
(Cutter)
Fuck!

50:43.805 --> 50:44.872
(laughter)

50:51.639 --> 50:53.336
(Cutter)
I got a treat for you, honey.

50:53.338 --> 50:55.338
No! No! No!

50:58.639 --> 50:59.706
(Allison scared)
No!

51:08.605 --> 51:09.906
No! No!

51:24.272 --> 51:25.737
(gasping)
I'm drowning!

51:25.739 --> 51:27.872
(Cutter)
Shut up and drown, then!

51:38.338 --> 51:39.339
(gasping)

51:47.770 --> 51:50.406
(Red Skull)
Tell me about your father.

51:50.605 --> 51:51.606
Go to Hell!

51:51.971 --> 51:53.569
I'm not playing.

51:53.571 --> 51:54.868
Why should I tell you?

51:54.870 --> 51:57.703
You're just some fucking loser
in a mask!

51:57.705 --> 51:58.706
(Cutter chuckles)

52:14.371 --> 52:15.506
I can't help you.

52:22.638 --> 52:23.839
(8 mm camera sound)

52:39.771 --> 52:41.302
(White Skull)
Fuck!

52:41.304 --> 52:42.936
God, this mask can go fuck
itself,

52:42.938 --> 52:44.469
I'm tired of this thing.

52:44.471 --> 52:45.470
You know, I shoulda been

52:45.472 --> 52:46.473
fucking Peep Show Girl.

52:47.737 --> 52:48.935
I'm way hotter than that bitch

52:48.937 --> 52:50.637
anyway and then she just comes
in like,

52:50.639 --> 52:52.436
"I'm Hainey's wife!

52:52.438 --> 52:54.338
I should be Peep Show Girl!"

52:54.804 --> 52:56.305
Fucking stupid bitch.

53:01.738 --> 53:02.739
(Nell)
What's wrong?

53:05.705 --> 53:06.705
You okay?

53:10.404 --> 53:11.405
Look at me.

53:13.638 --> 53:14.804
Who's your sister?

53:18.606 --> 53:19.405
Who loves you?

53:23.472 --> 53:24.872
You bet your ass I do.

53:34.938 --> 53:37.473
We're gonna get outta here soon,
okay?

53:37.738 --> 53:38.739
Just temporary.

53:40.004 --> 53:41.206
Grab a gun.

53:49.571 --> 53:50.838
I love the way I look.

53:52.539 --> 53:53.639
(classical music)

54:22.671 --> 54:23.672
Help!

54:31.671 --> 54:32.672
Help me!

54:34.338 --> 54:35.339
Help!

54:38.471 --> 54:39.839
(serene opera singing)

55:31.704 --> 55:32.704
You see this?

55:33.937 --> 55:36.506
That there is Boticelli's map of
hell

55:39.271 --> 55:40.272
Now, Perdition,

55:41.338 --> 55:42.339
that's my hell.

55:43.938 --> 55:45.303
For the time,

55:45.305 --> 55:46.306
yours too.

55:46.937 --> 55:47.938
See,

55:48.472 --> 55:50.305
the crime that got me here,

55:51.371 --> 55:52.871
well, that was cowardice

55:53.371 --> 55:54.437
Didn't even get me to

55:54.439 --> 55:56.373
the top of the first circle.

55:57.737 --> 55:58.771
Now see I'm...

55:59.705 --> 56:01.639
I'm just outside the gates,
right there.

56:03.472 --> 56:04.472
So,

56:04.904 --> 56:05.905
every day,

56:07.771 --> 56:09.539
I have to pay for my sins.

56:10.704 --> 56:11.705
My family

56:12.838 --> 56:14.639
would go on vacation in
New Jersey every summer.

56:16.305 --> 56:17.405
Wild Wood.

56:18.404 --> 56:20.738
My mom, my dad,

56:22.304 --> 56:23.571
and my brother Joey.

56:24.638 --> 56:25.702
See, Joey,

56:25.704 --> 56:27.803
he was two years older than me.

56:27.805 --> 56:28.936
His favorite ride was...

56:28.938 --> 56:30.536
was always the haunted houses.

56:30.538 --> 56:32.239
I'm scared to hell of it,

56:33.504 --> 56:34.602
he would tease me.

56:34.604 --> 56:36.237
Until I eventually agreed

56:36.239 --> 56:37.502
to go on the ride with him.

56:37.504 --> 56:38.535
But even then, I just, I just

56:38.537 --> 56:40.302
still just, I closed my eyes

56:40.304 --> 56:41.672
the entire ride, right.

56:42.738 --> 56:44.502
But the scariest one of them all
was

56:44.504 --> 56:45.905
called the Pit of Doom.

56:46.871 --> 56:47.872
One night,

56:48.471 --> 56:49.738
while we were there,

56:50.004 --> 56:51.206
it burned.

56:52.238 --> 56:54.871
Joey and I were on that ride
when it went down.

56:56.604 --> 56:58.239
Halfway through the ride,

56:59.271 --> 57:00.272
we stopped.

57:02.239 --> 57:03.306
Lights went out.

57:05.470 --> 57:06.804
Smoke was everywhere.

57:07.239 --> 57:08.472
The place it, it...

57:09.470 --> 57:11.471
was engulfed in seconds, really

57:11.870 --> 57:15.206
but a man with a flashlight came
by.

57:16.604 --> 57:17.605
Found us.

57:18.239 --> 57:20.003
He pulled us out of the car.

57:20.005 --> 57:22.536
He told us, told us to hold
hands.

57:22.538 --> 57:24.273
"Don't let go!" he said.

57:24.937 --> 57:26.172
So he held mine,

57:27.339 --> 57:28.272
and I held Joey's.

57:29.437 --> 57:32.337
He lead us through this, this
burning maze.

57:32.339 --> 57:33.402
Searching for a way out

57:33.404 --> 57:34.702
but we couldn't breath,

57:34.704 --> 57:35.936
and we couldn't see.

57:35.938 --> 57:38.435
It was then that Joey's hand

57:38.437 --> 57:39.804
slipped from my grasp.

57:41.972 --> 57:43.501
And I didn't

57:43.503 --> 57:45.504
say. A thing.

57:47.604 --> 57:49.704
I was too afraid, hmmm? Yeah.

57:50.972 --> 57:52.539
So I just kept moving on,

57:53.338 --> 57:54.769
kept getting pulled forward,

57:54.771 --> 57:56.669
and then it wasn't until we were
outside

57:56.671 --> 57:59.337
when they realized that Joey was
no longer

57:59.339 --> 58:00.505
behind me.

58:03.339 --> 58:04.804
By then it was too late.

58:07.338 --> 58:08.672
Place was an inferno.

58:08.871 --> 58:10.505
They didn't blame me though.

58:11.737 --> 58:13.438
I was just a kid, right?

58:15.904 --> 58:17.671
I could've said something.

58:18.470 --> 58:20.704
I could've done something.

58:23.304 --> 58:24.538
I let Joey die,

58:25.604 --> 58:27.371
because I was too afraid.

58:29.404 --> 58:30.539
Because I

58:30.938 --> 58:32.472
wanted to stay alive.

58:39.371 --> 58:40.739
What did he do to you?

58:41.938 --> 58:43.239
I don't remember.

58:43.637 --> 58:44.638
How bad was it?

58:46.570 --> 58:47.671
(chains rattling)

58:57.403 --> 58:58.538
Allison.

58:59.838 --> 59:01.273
Answer the question.

59:03.239 --> 59:04.405
(sobbing) I can't.

59:05.537 --> 59:06.538
I can't.

59:07.571 --> 59:08.639
Please, I can't.

59:13.238 --> 59:15.173
Okay. Then back under you go.

59:19.371 --> 59:21.205
(unintelligible whispering)

01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:26.568
(door banging)

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:27.835
(Man)
Let me in!

01:00:27.837 --> 01:00:29.804
Open this door right now!

01:00:30.671 --> 01:00:31.771
(angered yelling)

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:34.338
Right now!

01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:36.605
(Young Allison)
Leave me alone.

01:00:37.704 --> 01:00:38.705
(muffled sobbing)

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.204
(ominous music, unintelligible
whispering)

01:00:53.637 --> 01:00:54.805
(monster growling)

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:28.935
(Young Allison screams)

01:01:28.937 --> 01:01:31.735
(Man) What did I tell you
about locking the door?

01:01:31.737 --> 01:01:32.603
(more screaming)

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:33.605
Get up!

01:01:33.972 --> 01:01:35.504
(terrified screaming)

01:01:36.737 --> 01:01:37.903
(thuds)

01:01:37.905 --> 01:01:39.535
(Allison's Father)
Take it off now!

01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:41.536
Is that why you had that door
locked?

01:01:41.538 --> 01:01:42.936
(Allison's Father)
Take it off!

01:01:42.938 --> 01:01:44.671
(thuds and screams)
That's right cry!

01:01:45.605 --> 01:01:48.868
(Therapist) How did you process
your mother's passing?

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:50.805
How do you think I processed it?

01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:52.603
I was ten.

01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:53.736
It sucked.

01:01:53.738 --> 01:01:55.438
Cancer's a bitch, right?

01:01:56.637 --> 01:01:58.568
I was under the impression your
mother

01:01:58.570 --> 01:01:59.969
took her own life.

01:01:59.971 --> 01:02:02.171
That's one way to see it, sure.

01:02:02.972 --> 01:02:04.702
But that's not how I saw it.

01:02:04.704 --> 01:02:05.839
How do you see it?

01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:08.638
She was just desperate for a way
out.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.702
The cancer was there, alright.

01:02:11.704 --> 01:02:14.235
Not something you could see
under a microscope but,

01:02:14.237 --> 01:02:16.538
it was there, eating away at
everything.

01:02:18.905 --> 01:02:19.906
He let it in.

01:02:20.972 --> 01:02:22.635
(Therapist)
Your father?

01:02:22.637 --> 01:02:23.638
The monster.

01:02:26.303 --> 01:02:28.504
And how did he react to her
death?

01:02:31.604 --> 01:02:34.402
I know you don't want to discus
these things

01:02:34.404 --> 01:02:37.435
but these issues should've been
dealt with earlier.

01:02:37.437 --> 01:02:39.301
I was hospitalized for two
years,

01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:41.003
I think I dealt with them.

01:02:41.005 --> 01:02:42.205
Not properly,

01:02:43.205 --> 01:02:45.739
or you wouldn't be back here,
now would you?

01:02:47.404 --> 01:02:48.404
He drank more.

01:02:48.971 --> 01:02:50.839
And that's saying something.

01:02:51.303 --> 01:02:53.736
(Therapist)
And how did this behavior

01:02:53.738 --> 01:02:55.372
affect you at the time?

01:02:56.371 --> 01:02:57.739
It's hard to remember.

01:02:58.938 --> 01:02:59.939
But it's there.

01:03:02.004 --> 01:03:03.371
It's always there.

01:03:05.438 --> 01:03:06.438
What is?

01:03:07.804 --> 01:03:08.805
The weight.

01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:12.872
The gnashing in my stomach.

01:03:14.637 --> 01:03:16.271
The poison in my veins.

01:03:16.972 --> 01:03:18.639
And it's his blood, too.

01:03:19.937 --> 01:03:22.903
And it's black, and it's vile!

01:03:22.905 --> 01:03:25.336
And the more I have to fucking
think about it,

01:03:25.338 --> 01:03:28.605
the more I want to scratch my
fucking eyes out!

01:03:33.338 --> 01:03:34.338
Very good.

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:39.171
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:42.636
(Cutter)
Why'd you pick her?

01:03:42.638 --> 01:03:45.235
(Bob) I told you, she looked
better than anyone else.

01:03:45.237 --> 01:03:47.769
(Cutter) There's something
you're not telling me.

01:03:47.771 --> 01:03:50.402
(Bob) Can't reveal all
my secrets, can I?

01:03:50.404 --> 01:03:52.335
(Cutter)
She broke my nose, man!

01:03:52.337 --> 01:03:54.804
And you're just gonna what. cry
about it?

01:03:55.504 --> 01:03:57.235
How about I break your nose,
fucker,

01:03:57.237 --> 01:03:58.369
and we see how much you like it?

01:03:58.371 --> 01:04:00.336
You know how the game is played.

01:04:00.338 --> 01:04:02.437
I'm the only one who knows all
the cards.

01:04:03.237 --> 01:04:04.736
If you don't like it, then don't
play.

01:04:04.738 --> 01:04:05.936
There's something wrong with
her.

01:04:05.938 --> 01:04:08.935
(Bob) Look, this is her
paperwork, right here, okay?

01:04:08.937 --> 01:04:10.469
There's a fucking doctor's note
in there,

01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:11.903
read it if you don't believe me.

01:04:11.905 --> 01:04:12.936
(Cutter)
Get rid of her.

01:04:12.938 --> 01:04:14.536
(Bob)
You know I can't do that,

01:04:14.538 --> 01:04:15.902
not with the crew here.

01:04:15.904 --> 01:04:17.268
(Cutter)
Send her home.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.571
I need her here tonight.

01:04:21.471 --> 01:04:22.472
And right now,

01:04:23.438 --> 01:04:25.539
she's putting on one hell of a
show, okay?

01:04:25.938 --> 01:04:27.572
(Bob)
Don't you get it?

01:04:28.237 --> 01:04:31.338
I'm trying to take us to the
next fucking level.

01:04:31.604 --> 01:04:33.504
Everything is riding on this.

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:36.535
Perdition, it should be the
best.

01:04:36.537 --> 01:04:38.568
And we should be enjoying the
splendors of the best,

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:42.535
But no, I have fourteen fucking
dollars in my name,

01:04:42.537 --> 01:04:45.269
and I'm eating macaroni and
fucking cheese!

01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:47.836
(Cutter) And you can't help
but pick the most unstable,

01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:49.437
batshit crazy bitch you could
find, right?

01:04:49.738 --> 01:04:52.436
And you poke around in that
fragile brain of hers,

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:54.872
just to see what fireworks might
go off?

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:58.803
(Cutter) What happened
to helping people, Bob?

01:04:58.805 --> 01:05:01.572
If you don't like how I'm
running things,

01:05:02.337 --> 01:05:03.338
then go.

01:05:04.538 --> 01:05:05.906
Nobody's stopping you.

01:05:06.437 --> 01:05:08.237
You're paying for my nose.

01:05:09.638 --> 01:05:10.639
Send me a bill.

01:05:12.537 --> 01:05:16.271
Get to the back of the fucking
line like everyone else.

01:05:18.271 --> 01:05:20.437
(Cutter)
Perdition is gonna fail.

01:05:21.605 --> 01:05:23.771
And you're a shitty
screenwriter.

01:05:25.637 --> 01:05:26.802
Excuse me?

01:05:26.804 --> 01:05:28.237
Yeah, you heard me.

01:05:30.804 --> 01:05:31.805
Ah!

01:05:34.438 --> 01:05:35.438
Stay down, Bob.

01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:42.272
What're you doing? Get outta
here!

01:05:47.537 --> 01:05:48.771
(Allison screaming)

01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:52.635
We ain't fuckin' actors, okay?

01:05:52.637 --> 01:05:54.838
This ain't playtime. This is
real.

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:57.672
(speaking Japanese)

01:05:58.838 --> 01:06:01.738
(translator)
When you say "real," you mean?

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:04.772
Real means real.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.237
Do you speak English, you stupid
bitch?

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:10.505
(speaking Japanese)

01:06:11.337 --> 01:06:13.302
The fuck are you guys saying?

01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:15.372
What the fuck are you
even doing here?

01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:18.372
Goddamnit, get outta here!

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:33.935
(Rene on phone)
Hello?

01:06:33.937 --> 01:06:35.839
(Bob)
Hey, um, it's me.

01:06:36.904 --> 01:06:39.336
(Rene) I know it's you.
What do you want?

01:06:39.338 --> 01:06:41.438
Um... is Taylor there?

01:06:42.504 --> 01:06:44.337
(Rene)
He's doing homework.

01:06:44.605 --> 01:06:47.372
Look, I just wanted to, you
know, say hi.

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.402
Tell him I love him.

01:06:49.404 --> 01:06:50.535
(Rene)
We're kinda busy over here,

01:06:50.537 --> 01:06:52.301
we don't have all the free time
you do.

01:06:52.303 --> 01:06:54.336
I'll tell him you called, okay?

01:06:54.338 --> 01:06:58.368
Look, Rene, um, I need to talk
to Taylor, okay?

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:00.502
Just have a heart here, okay?

01:07:00.504 --> 01:07:02.172
It's been like, a month.

01:07:03.704 --> 01:07:05.571
(Rene)
It's not a good time.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.604
Well, when...

01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:10.238
When is a good time?

01:07:11.571 --> 01:07:16.236
(Rene) You're two months behind
on child support. Two months!

01:07:16.238 --> 01:07:17.336
Look, I know. Okay,

01:07:17.338 --> 01:07:19.336
but I... I miss him.

01:07:19.338 --> 01:07:20.870
(Rene)
I know, I know,

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:24.335
Taylor needs food Bob. Taylor
needs clothes.

01:07:24.337 --> 01:07:25.867
Taylor needs health insurance.

01:07:25.869 --> 01:07:27.536
He's falling behind on his
reading,

01:07:27.538 --> 01:07:28.868
and now I have to pay for a
tutor.

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:30.704
Do you have money for that?

01:07:32.936 --> 01:07:34.002
No.

01:07:34.004 --> 01:07:35.402
(Rene)
No, of course not.

01:07:35.404 --> 01:07:36.469
You never have money.

01:07:36.471 --> 01:07:39.739
You can talk to Taylor when you
pay what you owe.

01:07:40.471 --> 01:07:42.338
Look, I'm his father, Rene.

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:43.738
(Rene) Then act like it!

01:07:44.937 --> 01:07:45.938
Anything else?

01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:50.572
Yeah.

01:07:52.437 --> 01:07:53.768
Go fuck yourself!

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.835
(Rene)
Nice. So nice. Scumbag.

01:07:55.837 --> 01:07:58.472
Rene, no, Rene, just let me
speak to...

01:08:07.303 --> 01:08:08.304
(ominous music)

01:08:34.304 --> 01:08:35.904
(Nell)
Move fucker!

01:08:48.904 --> 01:08:50.767
The next game is called, "Run."

01:08:50.769 --> 01:08:52.901
(Zachary) I don't wanna play.
It's freezing!

01:08:52.903 --> 01:08:54.703
(Nell)
I don't wanna play!

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:57.272
I didn't fucking ask you, pansy!

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:03.372
Are you scared?

01:09:04.438 --> 01:09:05.505
It's not loaded.

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:18.238
Think again.

01:09:21.935 --> 01:09:24.504
Ain't no use in crying, little
baby!

01:09:25.935 --> 01:09:27.937
It ain't gonna do you no good!

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:30.501
(muffled voice on walkie talkie)

01:09:30.502 --> 01:09:31.505
(Nell)
Shit!

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:33.969
(Hainey on walkie)
Nell pick up.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:34.835
Go.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.868
(Hainey)
Is everything okay over there?

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:36.935
She's got a gun!

01:09:36.937 --> 01:09:39.335
(Hainey)
10-9, I didn't get that.

01:09:39.337 --> 01:09:40.868
I said we're having fun!

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:41.871
(Hainey)
10-4.

01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:44.270
Turn that shit off.

01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:47.667
(Nell)
As I was saying,

01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:49.737
the next game is called, "Run."

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.468
The object of the game is

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:53.270
to not fucking get caught.

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:55.438
If you get caught, you lose.

01:09:56.437 --> 01:09:58.538
I'd suggest not getting caught.

01:10:01.503 --> 01:10:02.505
Now run.

01:10:03.804 --> 01:10:05.539
(intense electronic music)

01:10:05.736 --> 01:10:07.668
(Nell)
Run, little piggies!

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.638
Run!

01:10:09.237 --> 01:10:10.238
(gunshots)

01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:18.272
(gunshot)

01:10:39.371 --> 01:10:41.338
(Nell)
Let's go huntin', sis.

01:10:43.403 --> 01:10:44.539
(heavy breathing)

01:11:22.636 --> 01:11:24.336
They're gonna fucking kill us.

01:11:24.338 --> 01:11:25.338
Quiet!

01:11:27.304 --> 01:11:28.505
(whooping in the distance)

01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:30.837
Did you hear that?

01:11:32.903 --> 01:11:34.904
(whooping and howling)

01:11:44.003 --> 01:11:45.204
Gotcha, baby!

01:11:46.537 --> 01:11:47.738
(Zachary screaming)

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.501
(crow cawing)

01:11:49.503 --> 01:11:51.670
- (Hainey) Bum a smoke, man?
- Yeah.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:53.703
Cathy picking you up?

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:57.337
(Hainey) Yeah, she'll be
here in a few minutes.

01:12:23.437 --> 01:12:25.369
(Hainey)
Think we ever go too far?

01:12:25.371 --> 01:12:26.372
What's too far?

01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:28.602
Fucking people up forever.

01:12:28.604 --> 01:12:29.604
(scoffs)
No.

01:12:30.603 --> 01:12:32.435
We haven't gone that far.

01:12:32.437 --> 01:12:33.437
Not yet.

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.468
It's too much white noise now.

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:38.368
That's why we have to keep going
harder and harder.

01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:39.935
(Bob) Otherwise, we're
just gonna be forgotten

01:12:39.937 --> 01:12:41.371
and... I don't know.

01:12:42.569 --> 01:12:43.937
Like we never existed.

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.336
(Bob)
I was first.

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:30.501
They all stole it from me.

01:13:30.503 --> 01:13:33.470
These... these damn movie studios

01:13:33.704 --> 01:13:34.902
fuckin' franchises,

01:13:34.904 --> 01:13:37.002
these East Coast hipster
perverts.

01:13:37.004 --> 01:13:39.301
These fuckin' horror directors,

01:13:39.303 --> 01:13:40.735
and they got nothin' better to
do.

01:13:40.737 --> 01:13:43.401
(Hainey) You got to remember
why you started this.

01:13:43.403 --> 01:13:45.804
Not to be the best. Not for the
money.

01:13:46.737 --> 01:13:47.935
You did it because there's not

01:13:47.937 --> 01:13:48.801
a night that goes by

01:13:48.803 --> 01:13:50.938
that you don't wake up in a cold
sweat.

01:13:51.769 --> 01:13:53.538
You're fuckin' scarin' me.

01:13:54.337 --> 01:13:56.801
You're in the right place.
(Cathy) John!

01:13:56.803 --> 01:13:59.802
- You smokin' again?
- God no! Swear to God, no!

01:13:59.804 --> 01:14:01.235
(Cathy)
Get your ass in here.

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:02.671
(Hainey)
Gotta go, man.

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:09.670
(car door closes)

01:14:20.737 --> 01:14:21.738
Stop!

01:14:22.769 --> 01:14:24.172
(Nell)
Turn around.

01:14:26.569 --> 01:14:27.601
Guess what?

01:14:27.603 --> 01:14:28.604
You won!

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:33.235
(Nell) Yup. So that means
you get to keep your life.

01:14:33.237 --> 01:14:36.336
And this little turd over here
gets to fuckin' die!

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.001
Allison, don't let them kill me!

01:14:38.003 --> 01:14:39.737
They're not gonna kill you.

01:14:40.637 --> 01:14:42.205
Because this is fake.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:44.501
Yeah.

01:14:44.503 --> 01:14:45.504
You're right.

01:14:45.837 --> 01:14:47.570
We're not gonna kill him.

01:14:47.804 --> 01:14:48.802
Because...

01:14:48.804 --> 01:14:49.804
you are.

01:14:51.604 --> 01:14:53.838
Point the fucking gun at his
head.

01:14:55.736 --> 01:14:56.738
No.

01:14:57.502 --> 01:15:00.001
What? You think this fuckin' boy

01:15:00.003 --> 01:15:02.002
is any different from all the
other men

01:15:02.004 --> 01:15:04.237
that have used and abused you?

01:15:04.936 --> 01:15:06.603
Oh c'mon, Allison.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:10.701
This little fucker's gonna go
off to college,

01:15:10.703 --> 01:15:12.803
and the first party he comes to,

01:15:13.237 --> 01:15:16.603
he's gonna find some drunk,
unsuspecting girl,

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.634
he's gonna get her alone,

01:15:18.636 --> 01:15:20.435
he's gonna fucking rip her
panties off,

01:15:20.437 --> 01:15:22.734
stick her face in the couch
cushion,

01:15:22.736 --> 01:15:25.171
and fucking rape her.

01:15:25.971 --> 01:15:27.902
(Zachary)
I'd never do that, Allison,

01:15:27.904 --> 01:15:29.935
I swear to God, I swear!

01:15:29.937 --> 01:15:30.801
Liar.

01:15:30.803 --> 01:15:32.271
He's a fucking liar!

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:34.935
You gonna let that happen,
Allison?

01:15:34.937 --> 01:15:37.500
She's gonna have to live with that
for the rest of her goddamn life

01:15:37.502 --> 01:15:38.868
and you're gonna let that
happen?!

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:40.701
Are you gonna fucking do
something about him

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.336
and kill him right now?

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.668
(whispering)
Do it. Do it, Allison.

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:46.767
Do it!

01:15:46.769 --> 01:15:48.835
Allison, I can blow your brains
out

01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:49.934
a fucking killer...

01:15:49.936 --> 01:15:50.938
Do it!

01:15:55.603 --> 01:15:56.703
The fuck?

01:15:57.536 --> 01:15:58.835
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:15:58.837 --> 01:16:00.404
- What the fuck!
- Oh no!

01:16:00.737 --> 01:16:01.738
(scream)

01:16:02.904 --> 01:16:03.934
I gave them the wrong...

01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:05.002
I gave her the right gun!

01:16:05.004 --> 01:16:06.467
He's dead!

01:16:06.469 --> 01:16:08.935
(Nell) I gave her the right gun! I
gave her the wrong fucking gun,

01:16:08.937 --> 01:16:10.301
what the fuck?!

01:16:10.303 --> 01:16:11.701
This is a fucking fake gun!

01:16:11.703 --> 01:16:12.934
He's not supposed to be dead!

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:14.368
I didn't fucking do this!

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:16.205
I gave her the gun!
(Allison) Somebody help!

01:16:19.904 --> 01:16:20.902
(Allison)
Help!

01:16:20.904 --> 01:16:22.204
Please!

01:16:22.469 --> 01:16:24.470
- Help me!
- Hurry the fuck up!

01:16:25.302 --> 01:16:27.236
- Please!
- Come on, come on! Get her!

01:16:27.238 --> 01:16:28.538
Get her! Fuck!

01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:31.537
Fuck! What the fuck happened!

01:16:37.402 --> 01:16:38.404
(door opens)

01:16:41.637 --> 01:16:43.735
Did you do the dishes, sweetie?

01:16:43.737 --> 01:16:44.738
Yes, Daddy.

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:49.738
Something you wanna tell me?

01:16:50.937 --> 01:16:51.938
No, Daddy.

01:16:57.836 --> 01:16:59.303
'Cause I, uh,

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.871
found a bowl that was missing
from the...

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:04.871
cupboard.

01:17:08.536 --> 01:17:11.204
And, uh, the funny thing is,

01:17:11.703 --> 01:17:13.002
I found it

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:14.671
in the trash can.

01:17:15.636 --> 01:17:17.268
It was all shattered,

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.503
and, uh, some blood

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.670
next to the trash can.

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:23.538
I dropped it from the sink.

01:17:24.769 --> 01:17:25.771
It broke.

01:17:34.503 --> 01:17:35.838
Did you cut yourself?

01:17:36.904 --> 01:17:38.871
(ominous music and heartbeats)

01:17:40.637 --> 01:17:41.638
(stabbing)

01:17:46.269 --> 01:17:47.271
(gurgling)

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:52.400
(Bob) Where's the body?
(Nell) It's still there.

01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:54.367
(Bob)
You left the body in the woods?

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:56.400
(Nell) What, I don't know
what the fuck to do with it!?

01:17:56.402 --> 01:17:58.002
(Bob) What if somebody... (Nell)
You want me to fucking go get it?

01:17:58.004 --> 01:18:00.404
(Nell)
Fine. Fuck, I'll go get it!

01:18:02.369 --> 01:18:03.500
(Bob) Bring the body here,

01:18:03.502 --> 01:18:05.570
and I'll figure out what to do.

01:18:13.937 --> 01:18:16.370
The straps are for your own
safety.

01:18:17.369 --> 01:18:19.204
So you don't hurt yourself.

01:18:19.536 --> 01:18:20.570
Where's Zachary?

01:18:21.804 --> 01:18:23.334
Allison, that was an accident.

01:18:23.336 --> 01:18:24.534
No, we need to call the police.

01:18:24.536 --> 01:18:25.538
No, just...

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.234
No police.

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:29.734
We kil-we killed him.

01:18:29.736 --> 01:18:32.368
Yeah, and you pulled the
trigger, okay?

01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:34.234
So just... no... police.

01:18:34.236 --> 01:18:35.401
It's m-murder.

01:18:35.403 --> 01:18:36.500
Don't

01:18:36.502 --> 01:18:37.534
say that.

01:18:37.536 --> 01:18:39.304
Don't ever say that again.

01:18:40.537 --> 01:18:41.601
It was an accident.

01:18:41.603 --> 01:18:43.835
There's no one to blame.
No one needs to find out.

01:18:43.837 --> 01:18:44.838
No.

01:18:45.303 --> 01:18:46.400
No.

01:18:46.402 --> 01:18:47.404
We killed him!

01:18:49.636 --> 01:18:50.638
(Bob)
Allison.

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:53.171
I'm not going to go to jail.

01:18:54.402 --> 01:18:55.670
I'm not gonna lose

01:18:55.904 --> 01:18:57.703
what little I have left.
Not for him.

01:18:57.970 --> 01:18:59.435
And not for you, okay?

01:18:59.437 --> 01:19:01.471
And I will bury you

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.171
both.

01:19:03.503 --> 01:19:04.937
Before I let it happen.

01:19:05.936 --> 01:19:07.270
Don't...

01:19:08.236 --> 01:19:09.236
test me.

01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:11.703
Now,

01:19:12.670 --> 01:19:14.237
what are we gonna do?

01:19:17.769 --> 01:19:20.537
You know, maybe I know
someone who can

01:19:22.236 --> 01:19:24.470
change your perspective on
things.

01:19:30.903 --> 01:19:31.905
(Allison)
Help!

01:19:32.803 --> 01:19:33.938
Somebody help me!

01:19:37.502 --> 01:19:39.670
(Allison on TV)
Somebody help me!

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:43.771
(Bob)
Are you ready?

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:45.571
(Allison)
Somebody!

01:19:46.869 --> 01:19:47.904
Then go.

01:19:48.937 --> 01:19:50.236
It's your time.

01:19:56.303 --> 01:19:57.403
(straps rattling)

01:20:04.502 --> 01:20:05.567
Help me!

01:20:05.569 --> 01:20:06.603
Help me, please!

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:09.838
Please, we need to call the
police! Please!

01:20:10.804 --> 01:20:13.434
I don't know what you want from
me!

01:20:13.436 --> 01:20:14.603
Please let me go!

01:20:20.937 --> 01:20:21.938
(ominous music)

01:20:30.736 --> 01:20:32.270
No! No! No!

01:20:32.603 --> 01:20:33.603
Wha-Get awa-

01:20:33.837 --> 01:20:34.835
No!

01:20:34.837 --> 01:20:35.838
No!

01:20:36.403 --> 01:20:37.371
No!

01:20:37.769 --> 01:20:38.934
(Allison screaming)

01:20:38.936 --> 01:20:41.204
(Allison's Father) Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.867
I'm sorry I had to wear the
mask.

01:20:43.869 --> 01:20:45.235
They made me.

01:20:45.237 --> 01:20:46.269
No!

01:20:46.271 --> 01:20:48.803
It was the only way I could
come and see you.

01:20:50.437 --> 01:20:51.938
I know I did bad to you.

01:20:52.436 --> 01:20:54.235
- No!
- I wasn't right in the head then.

01:20:54.237 --> 01:20:55.868
After Mom died,

01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:58.267
it was the booze, it was never
me!

01:20:58.269 --> 01:20:59.271
Never me.

01:21:00.337 --> 01:21:01.671
And I did my time.

01:21:02.703 --> 01:21:05.770
And you know I paid for what I
did to you.

01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:08.738
Fuck you! You didn't pay for
shit!

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:12.301
I can't let you run away again.

01:21:12.303 --> 01:21:13.304
No!

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:15.837
We can go back to the way it
was.

01:21:16.269 --> 01:21:18.436
Remember? You remember?

01:21:18.904 --> 01:21:21.837
Remember how good I used to make
you feel?

01:21:24.703 --> 01:21:25.703
I remember.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.571
I think about it every day.

01:21:29.269 --> 01:21:30.336
And every night.

01:21:30.937 --> 01:21:32.734
(Allison screaming in anger)

01:21:32.736 --> 01:21:33.738
(stabbing)

01:21:50.436 --> 01:21:52.236
(Allison's Father)
No. No!

01:21:53.637 --> 01:21:56.468
(Allison)
This is for every time you ever

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:59.671
tortured and degraded me.
You evil fucking piece of shit!

01:22:10.636 --> 01:22:12.637
(panicked Japanese)

01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:25.671
(door opening)

01:22:26.369 --> 01:22:27.703
(reporter whimpering)

01:22:59.804 --> 01:23:01.601
(Zachary)
Damn fake blood got in my eye

01:23:01.603 --> 01:23:04.537
when that squib went off, stings
like hell.

01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:06.371
What the fuck?

01:23:09.336 --> 01:23:10.337
Allison.

01:23:12.002 --> 01:23:13.204
Liar.

01:23:14.803 --> 01:23:15.803
Look.

01:23:16.935 --> 01:23:20.237
Don't do anything you're
gonna regret, okay? Yeah?

01:23:21.237 --> 01:23:22.604
I'm in on it, alright?

01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:26.301
I've been in on it from the start,
I'm part of the crew, okay?

01:23:26.303 --> 01:23:28.738
But this is, this is all just
part show.

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:30.704
Part of the experience.

01:23:31.303 --> 01:23:33.234
Like bringing my father here,

01:23:33.236 --> 01:23:34.770
part of the fucking show?

01:23:35.002 --> 01:23:37.936
I don't know anything about your
father, alright Allison? Okay?

01:23:38.868 --> 01:23:39.870
You're a liar.

01:23:40.503 --> 01:23:41.869
I fucking trusted you!

01:23:43.569 --> 01:23:44.571
Listen. Okay.

01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:47.604
You need help, Allison.

01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:50.869
Alright, so, why don't we
put the bat down?

01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:53.837
We both call 911 together?

01:23:57.269 --> 01:23:58.271
Please.

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:04.471
Allison, stop, this isn't real!

01:24:11.469 --> 01:24:15.170
(Zachary)
I'm sorry! Allison. I'm sorry!

01:24:16.902 --> 01:24:17.904
(hard thuds)

01:24:23.569 --> 01:24:24.571
Fuck you!

01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:34.304
That...

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:35.901
felt good.

01:24:35.903 --> 01:24:36.904
(foot steps)

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.571
Allison, you, uh...

01:25:09.936 --> 01:25:10.937
y-you did it.

01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:15.304
You-You survived Perdition.

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:17.571
Look, um,

01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:19.702
I'm proud of you,

01:25:19.704 --> 01:25:20.704
but, uh,

01:25:21.269 --> 01:25:22.267
now it's just,

01:25:22.269 --> 01:25:23.271
now it's time to just-

01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:24.737
put down the bat, and-

01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:26.869
and go home, okay?

01:25:27.503 --> 01:25:28.504
It's over.

01:25:29.836 --> 01:25:31.371
Now Allison, Allison just-

01:25:32.269 --> 01:25:34.567
just put it down okay.
No, no, no! Wa-Wa-Wait!

01:25:34.569 --> 01:25:35.571
(thud)

01:25:45.936 --> 01:25:47.204
(Bob) Oh my god...

01:25:48.269 --> 01:25:49.470
Allison, look just...

01:25:50.769 --> 01:25:53.604
just stop before you do anymore
harm, okay?

01:25:55.436 --> 01:25:57.570
You're having a mental
breakdown.

01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:03.437
No, Bob. I'm having a
breakthrough.

01:26:04.735 --> 01:26:05.737
(stabbing)

01:26:09.802 --> 01:26:10.903
(phone vibrating)

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:23.571
Oh God!

01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:49.337
(Taylor on the phone)
Daddy?

01:26:51.403 --> 01:26:52.203
Taylor.

01:26:53.603 --> 01:26:55.235
(Taylor)
Mommy didn't want me to call,

01:26:55.237 --> 01:26:57.234
but she's in the shower,
so I took her phone.

01:26:57.236 --> 01:27:01.503
I just wanted to tell you that I
miss you and that I love you a lot.

01:27:02.436 --> 01:27:03.436
I love you, too

01:27:04.635 --> 01:27:05.637
Listen.

01:27:08.537 --> 01:27:12.503
I'm always gonna love you.
I'm sorry for everything.

01:27:15.503 --> 01:27:17.770
(Taylor)
Why are you crying, Daddy?

01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:22.703
(Taylor)
Daddy? Daddy?

01:27:39.736 --> 01:27:42.271
That pretty little map
on the bottom of your mask?

01:27:43.369 --> 01:27:46.370
I knew what that was
before you said a word.

01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:50.837
Do you know what's at the bottom
of hell?

01:27:51.935 --> 01:27:53.336
Charlatans.

01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:55.504
And con artists.

01:27:57.403 --> 01:27:59.204
That's all you'll ever be.

01:28:01.369 --> 01:28:02.736
(Bob groaning in pain)

01:28:11.269 --> 01:28:12.271
(Bob) Oh God!

01:28:57.602 --> 01:28:58.569
Go.

01:29:11.636 --> 01:29:12.869
(labored breathing)

01:29:36.336 --> 01:29:37.436
It's just us now.

01:29:40.536 --> 01:29:41.537
Don't worry.

01:29:42.636 --> 01:29:43.869
It will all be over soon.

01:29:52.436 --> 01:29:53.667
(soft piano music)

01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:54.670
Shhh.

01:30:56.402 --> 01:30:57.403
Goodbye, Daddy.

01:31:24.902 --> 01:31:26.270
It happened again.

01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:28.271
I know.

01:31:29.936 --> 01:31:31.204
I don't like it.

01:31:32.902 --> 01:31:33.904
It feels wrong.

01:31:35.302 --> 01:31:36.304
It feels ugly.

01:31:38.602 --> 01:31:40.400
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:31:40.402 --> 01:31:42.603
I'm gonna get us both out of
here.

01:31:43.836 --> 01:31:44.837
Okay, mom.

01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:47.636
Don't call me that.

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:49.503
I'm your sister, okay?

01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:54.271
Okay.

01:32:34.902 --> 01:32:35.903
(thud in snow)

01:32:49.369 --> 01:32:50.770
This is my exit video.

01:32:51.868 --> 01:32:54.435
Tonight was important for me.

01:32:55.802 --> 01:32:56.937
Filled with fear.

01:32:57.869 --> 01:32:58.870
Vengeance.

01:33:00.836 --> 01:33:02.837
Acceptance.

01:33:03.236 --> 01:33:04.236
Death.

01:33:04.935 --> 01:33:05.937
Rebirth.

01:33:07.736 --> 01:33:10.403
It was... It was truly beautiful.

01:33:13.536 --> 01:33:15.203
I survived Perdition

01:33:19.268 --> 01:33:20.270
(phone beeps)

01:33:33.268 --> 01:33:35.233
(Morg) I'm flipping starving!
(Nell) I swear to God,

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:37.266
if I open this thing and
there's dog feces in it,

01:33:37.268 --> 01:33:38.536
I'm gonna fart in your mouth.

01:33:41.301 --> 01:33:42.637
(ominous electronic music)

01:33:44.235 --> 01:33:45.536
(Morg)
Who the hell is that?

01:33:48.602 --> 01:33:50.569
(Nell)
Turn off your lights, asshole!

01:33:51.268 --> 01:33:52.302
(engine revving)

01:33:55.768 --> 01:33:58.302
(car hitting bodies)
