00:01.575 --> 00:03.664
(Male announcer)
This season on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:04.320 --> 00:06.289
18 hopefuls
came to Los Angeles

00:06.421 --> 00:08.906
looking for their shot
at culinary stardom.

00:09.798 --> 00:11.116
(Announcer on pa)
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11.183 --> 00:12.900
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> chefs.

00:13.661 --> 00:15.685
(Announcer) But chef Ramsay
quickly brought the chefs

00:15.700 --> 00:16.989
back down to Earth.

00:18.122 --> 00:19.662
None of you are stars!

00:19.896 --> 00:21.188
(Announcer)
And put them to the test.

00:21.266 --> 00:22.860
Let's go!
(Announcer) In a variety of ways.

00:22.928 --> 00:23.762
[Shouting]

00:23.830 --> 00:25.430
[Squeals]

00:26.804 --> 00:27.765
[Bleep]. Stop!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.233
[Gasps]

00:29.300 --> 00:30.868
[Cheers and applause]

00:30.936 --> 00:32.101
Wow.

00:32.725 --> 00:34.038
Touchdown!

00:34.105 --> 00:35.039
[Wails]

00:36.294 --> 00:37.842
Wellington, perfect.

00:38.061 --> 00:40.198
Whoo!
Blue Team, let's go then.

00:40.331 --> 00:40.778
[Cheering]

00:40.846 --> 00:42.377
(Announcer)
They were rewarded...

00:42.939 --> 00:44.280
[All exclaiming]

00:44.903 --> 00:46.137
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

00:48.380 --> 00:49.171
[All cheer]

00:49.211 --> 00:50.319
Red Team!

00:50.379 --> 00:52.829
(Announcer) This season, however,
did have an abundance of meltdowns.

00:53.071 --> 00:56.054
- Ohh!
- I'm not doing it anymore!

00:56.328 --> 00:57.527
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:57.539 --> 00:59.555
I don't work with people
that speak English!

00:59.629 --> 01:00.618
Damn it!

01:01.118 --> 01:01.764
[Sighs]

01:02.254 --> 01:04.298
(Announcer)
And explosive confrontations.

01:04.391 --> 01:05.982
You gonna quit,
then just quit now.

01:06.029 --> 01:08.059
You ain't gonna talk to me
that type of way, I know that!

01:08.071 --> 01:09.499
Nooo!
I'm sick of this!

01:09.703 --> 01:11.941
You need to work
on your attitude!

01:12.127 --> 01:14.203
(Announcer) In this, the most
competitive season yet...

01:14.413 --> 01:15.276
Give me your chef jacket.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.953
(Announcer) It was hard
for the eliminated chefs

01:16.959 --> 01:17.812
to say good-bye.

01:17.962 --> 01:19.557
Please give me
another shot, chef.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.258
Good night and good luck.

01:21.487 --> 01:23.590
(Announcer)
But now, only four remain.

01:23.843 --> 01:26.915
Tonight, one of those four
will win Hell's Kitchen

01:27.005 --> 01:28.389
and claim the position
of head chef

01:28.457 --> 01:30.396
at BLT Steak
in New York City.

01:31.214 --> 01:32.697
Will it be Paul the pit bull,

01:32.757 --> 01:34.855
a junior sous chef
from davie, Florida?

01:34.915 --> 01:36.188
The cod and the bass!

01:36.422 --> 01:38.875
(Announcer) He was definitely the
most intense chef of the year.

01:38.943 --> 01:40.964
I will [Bleep] slap you
across the [Bleep] face.

01:41.345 --> 01:42.783
He can't [Bleep]
cook scallops!

01:43.011 --> 01:44.605
He can't get
the [Bleep] risotto out!

01:44.671 --> 01:45.313
Agh!

01:45.731 --> 01:48.045
(Announcer) Paul dropped the
ball early in the competition.

01:48.076 --> 01:50.054
Paul! It's [Bleep] raw.

01:50.263 --> 01:52.258
It's our first table!

01:52.759 --> 01:54.047
I'm struggling, Paul!

01:54.126 --> 01:55.748
Pink chicken! Get out!

01:56.474 --> 01:58.109
[Bleep]! Aagh!

01:58.151 --> 02:00.130
(Announcer) But he never
stopped believing in himself.

02:00.172 --> 02:01.847
I had the worst service
of my life.

02:01.858 --> 02:03.087
<i>I have</i>
<i>enough determination</i>

02:03.099 --> 02:04.705
to make sure it won't
[Bleep] happen again!

02:04.819 --> 02:05.991
My fire isn't out!

02:06.149 --> 02:08.411
(Announcer) He rallied back
with strong performance...

02:08.453 --> 02:10.073
Paul, you win the challenge.
Congratulations.

02:10.169 --> 02:11.262
(Announcer)
After performance...

02:11.288 --> 02:12.912
Paul, that's nicely
garnished there.

02:13.057 --> 02:14.086
(Paul)
Redemption!

02:14.206 --> 02:15.662
Spelled P-A-U-L.

02:15.728 --> 02:17.301
(Announcer)
And now is one of the favorites.

02:17.585 --> 02:20.433
Can Paul's dogged determination
bring him to victory?

02:20.497 --> 02:21.872
Tonight's service
is gonna solidify

02:21.904 --> 02:23.683
why I'm gonna win
<i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:23.887 --> 02:25.484
Announcer: Tommy, the wild card,

02:25.756 --> 02:27.427
(Announcer) A line cook
from Brewster, New York.

02:27.558 --> 02:29.100
Come on! Focus.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.848
(Announcer)
Tommy made an immediate mark.

02:30.915 --> 02:32.686
- The tattoo on the forehead.
- Says "rock & roll."

02:32.926 --> 02:34.208
So I've gotta
take you serious.

02:34.407 --> 02:35.432
I'd appreciate it
if you did.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.483
(Announcer) Although he often
played the comedian...

02:37.519 --> 02:38.816
I can see the sky!

02:38.840 --> 02:39.822
<i>Elise, you all right?</i>

02:39.830 --> 02:40.743
Look like you
got a bone to pick.

02:41.016 --> 02:42.048
Hey!

02:43.124 --> 02:44.922
(Announcer) His unique
dishes were impressive.

02:45.078 --> 02:46.992
I've never thought about
using quail egg on lamb.

02:47.004 --> 02:48.658
- That actually works quite well.
- Thank you.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.244
I'm definitely more tuned in
than people think I am.

02:50.252 --> 02:52.040
(Announcer) And in the
last couple of services,

02:52.042 --> 02:53.649
he made his voice heard
in the kitchen.

02:53.803 --> 02:55.397
Will, you put up plates,
followed by me.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.406
I knock down the puree.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.813
Pauly, you tail me
with the carrots.

02:57.823 --> 02:58.226
- All right.
- Very nice, Tommy.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.805
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

02:59.833 --> 03:01.514
(Announcer)
But will this unorthodox chef

03:01.521 --> 03:03.063
be able to rock and roll

03:03.080 --> 03:04.230
all the way to victory?

03:04.508 --> 03:06.499
I'm gonna have my eye
on the prize, believe you me.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.224
And not just my lazy eye.
My good eye.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.563
Three Wellington,
one New York strip.

03:10.596 --> 03:13.494
(Announcer) Will, the machine,
A sous chef from New Jersey...

03:13.521 --> 03:15.156
I'm a technician
when it comes to culinary.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.297
- I do it and I do it right.
- That is delicious.

03:17.358 --> 03:19.068
(Announcer) Proved to
be an unstoppable force

03:19.072 --> 03:19.850
right from the start.

03:19.945 --> 03:20.848
Let's do this!

03:21.029 --> 03:21.962
(Announcer)
Leading the Blue Team

03:21.970 --> 03:24.188
to one challenge win
after another.

03:24.398 --> 03:25.880
Will, you win the challenge.

03:25.928 --> 03:26.566
<i>Good job.</i>

03:26.890 --> 03:28.659
You've cooked the burger...
Perfect.

03:28.719 --> 03:29.745
[Applause]

03:29.949 --> 03:31.211
The winner of the challenge:

03:31.241 --> 03:32.659
Will, great job.

03:33.007 --> 03:35.434
(Announcer) And driving the blue
kitchen with his brash style.

03:35.661 --> 03:37.075
Just frickin' pay attention
to what you're doing!

03:37.164 --> 03:38.403
Guys, pick it up!

03:38.560 --> 03:40.528
Keep pumpin' it till
the last [Bleep] ticket's out.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.367
(Announcer)
Can will win the coveted title

03:42.379 --> 03:43.815
he desperately desires?

03:44.031 --> 03:45.469
I am ready
to kill 'em all

03:45.469 --> 03:47.080
and sort the bodies out
later on.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.794
It looks like it's been
chewed by your dog!

03:49.968 --> 03:51.524
(Announcer)
Elise, the fighter.

03:51.536 --> 03:53.519
A line cook from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania...

03:54.102 --> 03:56.010
I need another sea bass,
the right way!

03:56.047 --> 03:57.051
(Announcer)
Came out swinging.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.007
You scared?

03:58.047 --> 03:59.106
No! No!

03:59.167 --> 04:00.302
Shut up!
I'm talking.

04:00.748 --> 04:02.282
(Announcer)
And one chef in particular

04:02.288 --> 04:03.901
drew the full force
of her fury.

04:04.015 --> 04:05.897
Start packing [Bleep]
every dinner service,

04:05.944 --> 04:07.807
'cause I'm gonna make sure
your ass is going home.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.084
You don't have to yell at me.
I'm right here.

04:10.096 --> 04:11.174
You better
get out of my face.

04:11.182 --> 04:12.575
(Announcer) Never afraid
to speak her mind...

04:12.643 --> 04:14.231
I'm fighting for my life
right now.

04:14.243 --> 04:15.518
(Announcer)
Elise also had the talent

04:15.530 --> 04:17.045
to back up her big mouth.

04:17.087 --> 04:18.430
Who's gonna lead
the Red Team?

04:18.634 --> 04:20.276
- I am, chef.
- Let's go, then!

04:20.378 --> 04:21.694
Let's go, ladies!

04:21.869 --> 04:23.859
(Elise) I see myself as
a natural-born leader.

04:23.921 --> 04:25.766
I do have a big mouth,
but I know how to use it.

04:25.775 --> 04:26.986
We have got to do this.

04:27.010 --> 04:29.137
I am not sending
nobody home hungry.

04:29.148 --> 04:30.615
(Announcer)
Can the last woman standing

04:30.640 --> 04:31.935
be the last chef standing?

04:31.953 --> 04:33.129
I'm gonna kick
some serious ass

04:33.196 --> 04:34.918
'cause they're not even
gonna see it coming.

04:34.932 --> 04:37.223
(Announcer) Four top-skilled
competitors remain.

04:37.524 --> 04:38.801
Tommy, talk to me!

04:38.925 --> 04:40.845
(Announcer) But only one
can be crowned the winner.

04:41.308 --> 04:42.971
Don't interrupt me,
and I'll [Bleep] tell you!

04:43.044 --> 04:44.240
(Announcer)
Whose dream will come true?

04:44.282 --> 04:45.998
I'm sorry,
but I have standards,

04:46.016 --> 04:46.979
and that is not it.

04:47.256 --> 04:49.221
Are you deliberately trying
to [Bleep] me here or what?

04:49.311 --> 04:50.611
(Announcer)
Find out right now...

04:50.679 --> 04:52.762

04:54.893 --> 04:57.447
(Announcer) On the season finale

06:06.060 --> 06:08.349
<i>- Wow.</i>
(Elise) - Whoo!

06:10.958 --> 06:13.626
Who is the weakest chef?

06:15.604 --> 06:17.644
- Jennifer is.
- Jennifer, chef.

06:17.667 --> 06:18.954
I'd have to say it's Elise.

06:20.178 --> 06:22.931
All personal [Bleep] set
aside, you can cook.

06:23.051 --> 06:23.648
Thank you.

06:23.689 --> 06:25.950
And the people that actually
cook should [Bleep] stay.

06:26.370 --> 06:29.100
I'm back. I'm here.
Whoo-whoo!

06:29.698 --> 06:30.138
You know?

06:30.370 --> 06:32.198
That wasn't me
doining something...

06:32.203 --> 06:35.078
Me doing anyone a favor.
The truth.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.475
That was me being real.

06:37.725 --> 06:39.751
Don't give a hug?
You gonna be mad at me.

06:39.805 --> 06:42.494
I'm not mad at you,
but I *** them a hug

06:42.565 --> 06:43.235
That was real.

06:43.297 --> 06:45.033
Come on, I don't get one?
I got your back.

06:45.082 --> 06:45.942
(Elise)
No, you don't.

06:51.293 --> 06:53.110
(Announcer) Making it this
far in the competition

06:53.146 --> 06:54.881
is an impressive achievement.

06:55.009 --> 06:56.495
Gordon: - Good morning.
(All) - Good morning, chef.

06:56.537 --> 06:59.243
(Announcer) But chef Ramsay isn't
about to let the final four

06:59.320 --> 07:00.765
rest on their laurels.

07:00.805 --> 07:03.148
I think is really important at this stage
of the competition

07:03.166 --> 07:05.039
that you constantly
get inspired.

07:05.081 --> 07:07.947
<i>And your next challenge</i>
<i>will inspire you.</i>

07:07.984 --> 07:10.596
In fact,
not just the challenge

07:10.896 --> 07:14.738
but the judges will be
even more inspiring.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.678
<i>Would you like to meet</i>
<i>the judges?</i>

07:16.780 --> 07:17.739
(All)
Yes, chef.

07:17.866 --> 07:18.951
<i>I think you should.</i>

07:19.475 --> 07:22.474
Please welcome
judge number one...

07:22.576 --> 07:24.065
Oh, my God!

07:24.191 --> 07:26.490
Gordon: - Elise
(Elise) - No way!

07:27.110 --> 07:28.736
(Gordon) Your son, Chris Jr.,

07:28.940 --> 07:32.037
your husband Chris and
your aunt Deloris.

07:35.503 --> 07:36.416
Say "hi, mama."

07:36.435 --> 07:38.219
It felt really good
to see my son.

07:38.255 --> 07:39.934
Words can't express
how much I've missed him

07:39.946 --> 07:40.889
througout this journey.

07:41.184 --> 07:43.042
It seems like
he's grown up so much

07:43.060 --> 07:43.916
since I've been away,

07:43.928 --> 07:46.128
and he's motivation
for me being here.

07:46.513 --> 07:48.533
Ready for your next vip?

07:49.602 --> 07:50.927
- Tommy...
- Oh...

07:51.078 --> 07:54.056
Your mom  Diana, and
your girlfriend Kaitlin.

07:54.344 --> 07:55.894
[Bleep].
Holy [Bleep].

07:55.954 --> 07:56.485
[Applause]

07:56.904 --> 07:58.244
Gimme a kiss.

07:59.362 --> 08:00.365
<i>Easy, Tommy.</i>

08:01.217 --> 08:02.701
Easy, Tommy.
Tommy, is s a family show!

08:03.399 --> 08:04.887
Tommy's girlfriend is
really pretty.

08:04.905 --> 08:07.175
I mean, I'm not saying
that I didn't expect it,

08:07.295 --> 08:08.961
but I didn't expect that.

08:09.514 --> 08:12.121
- Hell yeah!
- Here's your brother Chris.

08:14.393 --> 08:15.583
God, I missed you.

08:16.107 --> 08:17.074
So proud of you, baby.

08:17.135 --> 08:18.396
Oh, my God!
So proud of you.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.177
Will, here's your mother
Michelle

08:20.929 --> 08:22.225
and your wife Tara.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.459
Ahhh...

08:27.204 --> 08:28.771
- I miss you so much.
- How are you?

08:28.783 --> 08:31.328
To actually see my wife
and my mother, I mean...

08:31.929 --> 08:34.909
Absolutely crazy and insane
and inspiring.

08:35.197 --> 08:37.938
I'll leave you alone
for a couple of minutes. Enjoy.

08:38.135 --> 08:39.823
My wife and my mother
are in my head

08:39.830 --> 08:42.361
every minute of every
[Bleep] hour of every day.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.533
I look at your picture
every single day.

08:48.192 --> 08:49.160
Oh, [Bleep] Tommy.

08:49.265 --> 08:51.062
Tommy's girlfiend is 19,
so that's the joke.

08:51.537 --> 08:53.377
I love you so much.
I love you.

08:53.715 --> 08:55.160
I think we might have got married
when I go home.

08:56.337 --> 08:58.034
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

08:58.731 --> 09:00.977
Tommy. Psst.
Your mom's there.

09:03.638 --> 09:05.141
For God's sake, man!

09:05.176 --> 09:06.294
I'm getting yelled at here.

09:09.318 --> 09:11.960
I've been up every time
they had the opportunity.

09:12.122 --> 09:13.552
Just because of you.

09:13.632 --> 09:16.150
I've had a lot of highs,
and I've had a lot of lows.

09:16.438 --> 09:18.958
Lows, like, where I thought
I was gonna go home.

09:18.972 --> 09:20.354
- I love you, mommy.
- I love you too.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.692
This is crazy. I can't
believe you're here.

09:23.812 --> 09:24.867
I can't believe
I'm here either.

09:24.935 --> 09:26.782
It's been the hardest thing
in the world

09:26.812 --> 09:28.848
not to be able
to go see my brother.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.048
My brother is my best friend,

09:30.283 --> 09:32.291
100% what I just needed
right now

09:32.303 --> 09:33.752
is my brother
to walk through the doors.

09:33.868 --> 09:35.076
How's that for inspiration?

09:35.316 --> 09:37.812
- Very inspiring, chef.
- Amazing, chef.

09:39.455 --> 09:42.008
Okay, families, first of all
I'd like to say a big thank you.

09:42.152 --> 09:43.403
But unfortunately,
it's timtoto go.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.304
I don't want
to say good-bye.

09:45.430 --> 09:47.189
Tommy, wrap up the homework.

09:47.898 --> 09:49.364
- Paul, please.
- Yes, chef.

09:49.484 --> 09:51.135
Elise, say good-bye
to your lovely family.

09:51.219 --> 09:52.165
I love you.
I love you.

09:53.017 --> 09:54.012
Chris, take it easy.

09:54.401 --> 09:55.259
Love you, baby.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.975
Tommy get back over there.

09:59.617 --> 10:01.821
My head is in a totally
different realm right now.

10:02.218 --> 10:04.865
I am ready to beat the [Bleep]
out of people...

10:05.069 --> 10:07.629
Kill 'em all and
sort the bodies out later on.

10:10.553 --> 10:12.003
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

10:17.319 --> 10:20.255
(Announcer) The chefs have just
had a brief but satisfying visit

10:20.261 --> 10:21.353
with their loved ones.

10:21.568 --> 10:23.154
Now it's time to get
back to business.

10:23.195 --> 10:25.157
(Announcer) Now, seeing how
they are the final four,

10:25.263 --> 10:26.915
chef Ramsay has decided
to cook up

10:26.948 --> 10:28.785
one of his most
difficult challenges.

10:29.022 --> 10:31.248
This is your next challenge.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.047
- Ooh.
(Gordon) - It's time for

10:33.241 --> 10:34.953
"taste it, now make it."

10:35.981 --> 10:38.205
<i>You're all gonna have</i>
<i>35 minutes</i>

10:38.709 --> 10:40.499
to duplicate this dish.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.912
The chef that comes closest
to recreating this dish

10:43.916 --> 10:45.300
<i>will clearly win the challenge.</i>

10:45.394 --> 10:47.388
The winner gets to spend
the rest of the day

10:48.467 --> 10:49.282
with your family.

10:50.030 --> 10:51.717
<i>(Tommy)</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

10:52.271 --> 10:53.886
I'm, like, super nervous
right now.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.592
Everything's on the line today
with this challenge.

10:55.645 --> 10:56.998
I just want to spend
the afternoon

10:56.993 --> 10:58.487
with the most beautiful woman
in the world.

10:58.597 --> 11:00.165
I'm bringing everything I have.

11:00.251 --> 11:01.784
- Are you ready?
(All) - Yes, chef.

11:01.915 --> 11:04.634
35 minutes.
Your time starts now.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.804
(Announcer) In the "taste
it, now make it" challenge,

11:06.882 --> 11:09.550
each chef must recreate
chef Ramsay's dish

11:09.574 --> 11:12.462
from sight, smell,
touch, and taste.

11:12.576 --> 11:13.318
What is that?

11:13.342 --> 11:14.954
(Announcer) However,
they get no information

11:14.961 --> 11:17.176
about the ingredntnts
or the recipe.

11:18.098 --> 11:19.505
(Elise)
I can't figure it out.

11:20.408 --> 11:21.619
(Announcer) While it's
important for the chefs

11:21.638 --> 11:23.827
to analyze every component
of the dish.

11:23.929 --> 11:27.048
Identifying the main protein
is absolutely critical.

11:27.202 --> 11:28.056
[Sighs]

11:28.087 --> 11:29.732
The battle within myself
was the fish.

11:29.744 --> 11:31.855
I could not tell
if it was cod or Halibut.

11:31.914 --> 11:33.201
I was, like, ugh!

11:33.251 --> 11:34.649
"I know it's one of
these two for sure,

11:34.664 --> 11:36.156
but I just don't know."

11:36.398 --> 11:37.923
<i>One little tip...</i>
<i>You can cook</i>

11:37.934 --> 11:39.105
two different sorts of fish,

11:39.199 --> 11:40.942
and drop one
with two minutes to go.

11:43.660 --> 11:44.352
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Come on, Elise.</i>

11:44.372 --> 11:45.964
I see your beasty
little eyes

11:45.967 --> 11:47.243
watching everybody
like a hawk.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.997
Stop worrying about everybody
else... worry about your dish.

11:50.036 --> 11:51.400
Looking at the fish,
tasting the fish,

11:51.490 --> 11:53.671
I'm 99% sure
that it's monkfish.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.188
So, I'm gonna look by the Gordon,
die by the Gordon

11:56.190 --> 11:57.897
And I'm gonna go with
what I feel.

11:58.295 --> 11:58.770
Whoo!

11:58.787 --> 12:01.197
(Announcer) Will and Tommy
have decided on monkfish

12:01.249 --> 12:03.142
while Elise is going
with Halibut.

12:03.318 --> 12:04.759
Paul is still unsure,

12:04.790 --> 12:06.885
but has narrowed it down
to two choices.

12:07.372 --> 12:09.860
The only think I was really
reserved about, was the cooked fish

12:10.159 --> 12:11.742
That was the hardest thing
to determine

12:11.761 --> 12:15.260
because cod and monkfish
look similar, so I seared both.

12:15.649 --> 12:17.572
I just wanted to be
100% sure.

12:18.293 --> 12:19.424
14 minutes to go.

12:20.328 --> 12:22.456
So I'm trying to figure out
what the ham is

12:22.623 --> 12:24.143
wrapped around the fish.

12:24.194 --> 12:26.058
It was not salty enough
to be prosciutto.

12:26.323 --> 12:28.875
I grabbed the serrano ham
because it was the least salty.

12:29.275 --> 12:30.840
I think I have
a damn good palate.

12:32.592 --> 12:33.844
I look over at Tommy,

12:33.857 --> 12:35.946
and I was, like,
that's definitely not it.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.534
I was, like, what the [Bleep]
is he doing?

12:38.096 --> 12:39.971
(Announcer) While Tommy
believes that chef Ramsay

12:39.985 --> 12:41.811
used serrano ham
in his dish,

12:41.878 --> 12:45.439
Will, Elise, and Paul have all
opted to use prosciutto.

12:45.772 --> 12:47.693
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Four minutes. Step up a gear.</i>

12:47.760 --> 12:49.361
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, all of the final four

12:49.386 --> 12:52.887
have chosen mushrooms,
kale, and cream

12:52.912 --> 12:54.546
to garnish their entrees.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.731
15 seconds.
Start plating, guys.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.028
<i>(Elise)</i>
<i>Behind, behind.</i>

12:58.856 --> 13:00.548
Five, four,

13:01.304 --> 13:04.209
<i>three, two, one.</i>

13:04.555 --> 13:05.999
<i>And stop, guys. Let's go.</i>

13:06.102 --> 13:07.707
All right. Is everybody
happy with their dish?

13:07.875 --> 13:08.776
(All)
Yes, chef.

13:08.809 --> 13:10.844
Okay, let's start off
with Tommy.

13:10.989 --> 13:12.690
- Oh, jeez, I hate going first.
- Let's go.

13:12.732 --> 13:14.872
I can't stand going first.
It's the worst in the world.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.637
I shouldn't have put my dish
close to the chef.

13:16.637 --> 13:17.967
I should have scooted
to the back.

13:18.147 --> 13:20.446
Right, tell me what you did.
Fish... what did you use?

13:20.552 --> 13:22.269
- I used monkfish.
- Monkfish?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.094
<i>Why monkfish?</i>

13:24.151 --> 13:25.874
<i>I tasted it, and then</i>
<i>just looked at it,</i>

13:25.917 --> 13:28.349
and then took
the best guess I had.

13:28.896 --> 13:30.290
And you wrapped the monkfish
in what?

13:30.486 --> 13:32.115
Um, I believe
it's a serrano.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.945
Mmm. The sauce.

13:35.073 --> 13:36.329
<i>Cooked down some cream.</i>

13:36.379 --> 13:37.683
That's kale underneath.

13:37.713 --> 13:39.760
- Not bad. All right.
- Was I close?

13:39.852 --> 13:41.519
I'll let you know.
Back oththe line, thank you.

13:41.874 --> 13:44.843
Okay, Elise.
Uh, fish... what is it?

13:45.113 --> 13:46.121
Halibut.

13:47.028 --> 13:48.061
<i>Interesting.</i>

13:48.082 --> 13:49.782
<i>I've got one Halibut,</i>
<i>one monkfish.</i>

13:49.853 --> 13:52.076
- And it's wrapped in?
- Prosciutto.

13:52.921 --> 13:54.405
<i>- Okay. Thank you.</i>
- Yeah.

13:54.497 --> 13:55.942
- Will.
- Yes, chef.

13:56.134 --> 13:58.546
- The fish... what is it?
- I did a monkfish.

13:58.583 --> 13:59.833
- Monkfish?
- Yes, chef.

14:00.061 --> 14:01.317
Were you copying Tommy?

14:01.829 --> 14:02.839
Not at all, chef.

14:03.013 --> 14:04.398
What did you wrap
the monkfish in?

14:04.466 --> 14:05.599
<i>Prosciutto.</i>

14:06.333 --> 14:08.134
And monkfish was your first...

14:09.011 --> 14:10.457
Was my one and only
choice of fish.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.401
- It tastes good. I'll let you know.
- Thank you.

14:12.412 --> 14:13.622
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Thank you, chef.

14:13.776 --> 14:15.165
All right, Paul.
Yes, chef.

14:15.827 --> 14:16.642
Let's go.

14:16.748 --> 14:18.110
I cooked off
two pieces of fish.

14:18.128 --> 14:19.712
I cooked off a monkfish
and a cod.

14:20.325 --> 14:22.462
- So what is this fish?
- This is the cod.

14:22.618 --> 14:23.824
- Cod. Okay.
- Yes.

14:24.087 --> 14:26.611
Confidence level super high
because I think it's cod.

14:26.753 --> 14:29.202
I don't think it was monkfish.
It didn't look the same.

14:29.571 --> 14:31.572
It might have been Halibut,
but I mean, I was confident

14:31.582 --> 14:32.727
it wasn't monkfish.

14:33.060 --> 14:34.693
And the cod's wrapped in...

14:34.888 --> 14:36.089
- Prosciutto.
<i>- Really?</i>

14:36.734 --> 14:38.458
Okay, we've got two monkfish,

14:38.661 --> 14:40.266
<i>one Halibut, and one cod.</i>

14:40.365 --> 14:42.788
You all got mushrooms,
you all used kale,

14:42.988 --> 14:44.423
you all got cream.

14:44.469 --> 14:45.727
That's about where
it stops, huh?

14:45.842 --> 14:47.865
Now, Tommy...
Yes.

14:48.006 --> 14:51.308
You are the only one
who used sorrano ham.

14:51.381 --> 14:52.376
Is that good or bad?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.177
It wasn't right.

14:54.439 --> 14:56.190
Prosciutto was the right
ingredient.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.912
Congratulations,
all three of you.

14:58.101 --> 15:00.171
- Tommy, game over, big boy.
 - Damn it!

15:01.528 --> 15:04.677
Okay, the person with the dish
that is closest

What?

15:54.510 --> 15:56.411
- What'd he say?
- Going to the Dodger game, son.

15:56.478 --> 15:58.007
Nice.

15:58.047 --> 16:00.381
I would have loved to have
spent the day at the Dodger game

16:00.414 --> 16:01.516
with my wife
and my mother.

16:01.541 --> 16:02.906
So I have nobody to blame
but myself.

16:02.923 --> 16:04.204
It doesn't mean Paul
was better than me,

16:04.228 --> 16:05.384
it's just that
I screwed myself.

16:06.053 --> 16:07.163
Look what cod got you.

16:07.235 --> 16:08.336
Exactly!

16:08.563 --> 16:11.583
This right here is the greatest
reward I could possibly get.

16:11.706 --> 16:13.754
To go sit and watch baseball
with my brother,

16:13.911 --> 16:16.913
and just come back here ready
to kick [Bleep] everyone's ass.

16:17.130 --> 16:19.092
<i>The rest of you,</i>
<i>today...</i>

16:19.953 --> 16:21.862
Is moving day
in Hell's Kitchen.

16:22.061 --> 16:23.921
I need everything
moved out.

16:24.145 --> 16:25.278
Oh, no, come on.

16:25.701 --> 16:27.307
<i>No, don't do that to me.</i>

16:28.234 --> 16:29.643
Everybody up to the dorms.
Well done.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.271
- Enjoy the game. Yes?
- Yes, chef.

16:31.723 --> 16:33.589
- Enjoy it with your brother.
- Well done, Pauly.

16:45.492 --> 16:46.551
Hey, guys.

16:46.569 --> 16:48.226
- Hello.
<i>- Welcome, welcome.</i>

16:48.460 --> 16:50.906
- Welcome to Dodger Stadium...
- Thank you.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.963
Which I call blue heaven
on Earth.

16:53.231 --> 16:54.117
Awesome.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.983
Which one of you
is the chef?

16:56.061 --> 16:56.996
I am, sir.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.819
You know how to make
pasta vizule?

16:58.850 --> 17:00.171
I can make some pasta vizule.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.220
- Tommy Lasorda...
- Go on in. Let's go.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.925
The epitome, the icon
of Dodgers baseball.

17:07.954 --> 17:09.545
This is a once
in a lifetime thing.

17:09.555 --> 17:11.750
I don't think I've ever stood
on a major league field before.

17:11.842 --> 17:12.972
You deserve it, buddy.

17:12.992 --> 17:14.997
(Paul) Me and my brother
are huge Yankee fans,

17:15.023 --> 17:17.554
but the second you walk onto
the field in Dodger Stadium,

17:17.609 --> 17:19.642
yo you feel the history.

17:19.666 --> 17:22.185
You feel the presence
of greatness.

17:22.186 --> 17:25.223
You feel the legends that have
walked on that field.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.660
<i>- How you guys doing?</i>
- How you doing?

17:26.690 --> 17:27.924
- How's everything?
- I'm great.

17:27.951 --> 17:28.962
- How are you?
- Wow.

17:28.995 --> 17:30.094
- This is awesome.
- What's happening?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.641
<i>Where you guys from?</i>

17:31.915 --> 17:33.495
South Florida, but
originally from New York.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.033
Oh, yeah? You too?

17:35.081 --> 17:36.875
<i>Huge Yankee fans,</i> <i>we are.</i>
Uh-oh.

17:36.887 --> 17:39.559
I met the Yankee legend himself,
Don Mattingly!

17:39.593 --> 17:41.843
The only thing missing
was his awesome moustache.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.156
- Very nice, man.
- Well, nice to meet you guys.

17:43.171 --> 17:44.941
- Nice to meet you too, sir.
- All right.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.002
We'll try to get a "w"
for you guys tonight.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.087
- Hopefully.
- Thank you.

17:47.217 --> 17:48.881
- Take care. Good luck.
- Thank you.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.583
- Good luck to you.
- Awesome.

17:50.651 --> 17:52.452
I shook Don Mattingly's hand.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.787
He wished me good luck
in this competition!

17:55.547 --> 17:57.723
That's it. It does not get
any better than this.

17:57.791 --> 18:00.737
That is the pinnacle
of greatness in Paul's book.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.882
I can't stop smiling.

18:03.031 --> 18:05.003
<i>That made my whole trip</i>
<i>right there.</i>

18:05.067 --> 18:06.179
Now I have to go and win.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.611
<i>- Now go and win.</i>
- I gotta go and win.

18:07.649 --> 18:09.178
(Announcer)
While Paul enjoys some face time

18:09.199 --> 18:10.460
with major league legends...

18:10.498 --> 18:11.945
(Elise)
This room is kinda nasty.

18:12.039 --> 18:13.258
(Announcer)
Back in Hell's Kitchen,

18:13.285 --> 18:16.146
the losers come face to face
with a major league mess.

18:16.168 --> 18:17.716
Oh, hell no, dude.

18:17.899 --> 18:19.408
I'm gonna start
in the other room.

18:19.479 --> 18:21.261
Breaking down the dorms
is pretty [Bleep] gross

18:21.291 --> 18:23.698
because females are
disgusting creatures.

18:24.161 --> 18:26.190
Oh, [Bleep].
For real, dude!

18:26.236 --> 18:27.703
- Oh, my God!
<i>- What?</i>

18:27.742 --> 18:29.467
<i>Whose bed was this?</i>
<i>Jennifer.</i>

18:29.555 --> 18:31.122
<i>And whose bed was that?</i>

18:31.175 --> 18:33.296
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer, Jennifer and Jennifer.

18:33.551 --> 18:34.838
<i>(Will)</i>
<i>You guys are nasty!</i>

18:34.888 --> 18:36.988
Cheeseburgers and roast beef
sandwiches under the bed.

18:37.013 --> 18:38.793
And, like, this is the girls
we're talking about.

18:38.823 --> 18:40.717
They're the most
grimy ladies.

18:41.444 --> 18:43.095
Oh, what the [Bleep]
is that?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.081
There's, like, a [Bleep] stain
under this one.

18:45.097 --> 18:46.856
Why don't you smell it, Tommy?
Tell us what it is.

18:46.878 --> 18:49.538
Elise, give it a taste.
You have the best palate.

18:51.509 --> 18:53.775
This is a great day
for the Niedermann brothers.

18:53.843 --> 18:55.262
It definitely is.

18:56.713 --> 18:59.564
(Announcer over pa) And now here to
throw out the first pitch this evening,

18:59.841 --> 19:01.483
Gordon Ramsay.

19:01.988 --> 19:03.650
Yeah, chef!
Yeah!

19:04.174 --> 19:07.225
Like, of all the people that can
come and throw a first pitch,

19:07.345 --> 19:08.564
it's gonna be chef.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.296
(Announcer over pa)
All right, Gordon.

19:09.339 --> 19:10.881
Time for you
to bring the heat.

19:12.783 --> 19:15.563
[Cheers and applause]

19:15.631 --> 19:18.028
I didn't think I would have
ever saw chef in Dodger Blue

19:18.042 --> 19:19.680
instead of chef white,
but you know what,

19:19.774 --> 19:21.866
he looked good in Dodger blue,
I ain't gonna lie.

19:26.175 --> 19:27.013
Hey, chef!

19:27.177 --> 19:30.110
You cannot go to a baseball game
without a famous Dodger dog.

19:30.177 --> 19:31.458
Yes?
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

19:31.467 --> 19:33.020
- Now, enjoy.
- Ah, thank you, chef.

19:33.033 --> 19:34.300
- How are you, buddy?
- Good, chef.

19:34.318 --> 19:35.254
- Are you enjoying it?
- Yes.

19:35.416 --> 19:36.539
What an afternoon.

19:36.564 --> 19:37.923
See what happens when
you win a challenge?

19:37.945 --> 19:38.284
Yeah.

19:38.301 --> 19:39.536
- Best wishes.
<i>- Thank you, chef.</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:40.853
Good to see you, buddy.
Yes? Good to see you.

19:40.878 --> 19:42.111
- Likewise. Enjoy the game.
- Yes, chef.

19:42.129 --> 19:43.994
It didn't bounce. Remember.
It didn't bounce.

19:45.174 --> 19:46.692
- Take care, guys.
<i>- Take it easy, chef.</i>

19:46.760 --> 19:48.994
Beers, hot dogs,
bros, and baseball.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.401
You can't beat that
with a stick.

19:55.693 --> 19:57.535
(Announcer) It's a big
day in Hell's Kitchen,

19:57.603 --> 19:59.478
and the chefs
are busy preparing

19:59.502 --> 20:02.104
for the most important dinner
service of their lives.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.734
That's mascarpone.
No, that's butter.

20:04.143 --> 20:05.443
That's mascarpone.

20:07.757 --> 20:09.255
Oh, you're right.
I thought it was butter.

20:09.279 --> 20:10.546
I think Tommy
has made it this far

20:10.571 --> 20:13.448
because of his ability
to take the back seat

20:13.490 --> 20:15.017
and to be bossed around.

20:15.052 --> 20:17.188
But now there's four of us,
and Tommy's next.

20:19.758 --> 20:21.323
Let's go, guys, yeah?

20:21.379 --> 20:24.347
Okay, tonight is
all about leadership.

20:25.045 --> 20:28.396
Each of you will have a turn
to run the pass.

20:29.575 --> 20:32.525
Tonight is the dinner service
that is gonna determine

20:32.681 --> 20:34.917
who makes it
to the final two.

20:36.571 --> 20:38.708
For half of you here,
it's over.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.260
I honestly can't believe that two
people are going home tonight.

20:41.294 --> 20:43.147
I mean, this makes everything
that much more real.

20:43.475 --> 20:46.328
The biggest day
of your cooking career

20:46.799 --> 20:48.043
<i>is about to start.</i>

20:48.275 --> 20:49.975
Got it? (All) Yes, chef.

20:50.150 --> 20:51.742
Go on your stations, yeah?

20:51.971 --> 20:53.003
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

20:53.412 --> 20:54.600
Okay, James, let's go.

20:54.637 --> 20:56.534
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Yes, chef.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.602
(Announcer) There is clearly a lot
riding on tonight's dinner service.

21:08.670 --> 21:11.137
When it's over, two chefs
will be going home,

21:11.170 --> 21:13.615
and two chefs will be
moving on to the final.

21:13.636 --> 21:14.584
Here we go.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.351
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
will provide a series

21:16.367 --> 21:17.596
of quality-control tests

21:17.624 --> 21:20.492
to challenge the chefs when they're
leading the kitchen at the pass.

21:20.887 --> 21:22.215
First up is Paul.

21:22.437 --> 21:24.179
- Paul, you with me?
- Yes, chef.

21:24.224 --> 21:26.156
- Run the hot plate. Let's go.
- Yes, chef.

21:26.212 --> 21:28.218
Appetizers... four scallops
and a risotto

21:28.246 --> 21:30.264
followed by two Wellington,
a sea bass, and a cod.

21:30.287 --> 21:31.521
- Heard that.
- Yes, chef.

21:31.829 --> 21:33.268
Five minutes
on the first risotto.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.715
Pauly is gonna be on top.

21:34.773 --> 21:37.263
I'm gonna show you why
I'm a big deal tonight.

21:37.787 --> 21:40.198
- Scallops.
- Risotto's up.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.933
Service, please.
Go. Quick.

21:42.174 --> 21:44.308
How long on the two
Wellingtons, cod, and bass?

21:44.603 --> 21:46.412
I can rock.
You tell me when you want it.

21:46.413 --> 21:48.118
Garnish.
30 seconds on that garnish.

21:48.149 --> 21:50.159
Let's go.
Tommy, how long on the fish?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.415
- Let's go, Tommy.
<i>(Paul)</i><i>- Tommy...</i>

21:54.583 --> 21:56.412
How long's it gonna be,
Tommy?

21:57.069 --> 21:59.036
I love Tommy to death,
but in the kitchen,

21:59.183 --> 22:00.613
he doesn't [Bleep] talk!

22:00.642 --> 22:02.075
Tommy, how long
on the fish?

22:02.387 --> 22:04.249
A minute and a half.
Minute and a half heard.

22:04.273 --> 22:05.621
A minute out.
Waiting on fish, chef.

22:05.644 --> 22:07.118
Cod's coming, chef.

22:10.226 --> 22:12.126
- Chef, I think this is under.
- It's raw.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.251
- Tommy, this fish is raw.
- What's up?

22:14.364 --> 22:16.183
Tommy, one more minute
in the oven.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.887
Throw it right back in the oven,
I'll plate everything else.

22:17.958 --> 22:20.622
(Announcer) As Paul works to
recover from Tommy's raw fish,

22:20.922 --> 22:23.779
he's about to face
chef Ramsay's first sabotage

22:23.840 --> 22:26.509
as chef Scott puts shrimp
instead of lobster

22:26.576 --> 22:27.976
in the capellini.

22:28.044 --> 22:30.177
Two capellini?
Capellini right now.

22:34.023 --> 22:35.721
Okay, come here, you. Come here.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.358
Yes, chef.

22:36.786 --> 22:38.467
It's shrimp. It's <i>shrimp.</i>

22:38.485 --> 22:40.305
Oh, it is shrimp.
It's not lobster.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.185
Chef Scott sent me
capellini with shrimp

22:42.224 --> 22:43.190
instead of lobster.

22:43.222 --> 22:44.822
You win some,
you lose some.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.355
It's how you bounce back
that makes you the chef you are.

22:47.379 --> 22:48.988
- What's the matter with them?
- They're shrimp.

22:49.015 --> 22:50.849
- Oh, really?
- Don't let it happen again, all right?

22:50.884 --> 22:53.081
(Announcer) Despite failing his
first quality control test...

22:53.100 --> 22:54.522
Server, please.

22:54.550 --> 22:56.914
Paul is doing a solid job
leading the kitchen,

22:56.938 --> 22:59.640
and pushes food out
to the diners at a steady pace.

22:59.707 --> 23:01.907
- Wow.
- Cheers.

23:02.030 --> 23:04.632
(Announcer) But back in the kitchen,
one more test awaits him,

23:04.668 --> 23:06.502
and his name is...
Tommy!

23:06.570 --> 23:09.602
I need one cod right now
to finish the table. How long?

23:10.050 --> 23:12.098
- Now?
- I'd say, uh...

23:12.285 --> 23:14.290
- Tommy, talk!
- Pauly was too antsy.

23:14.350 --> 23:15.753
He's calling... where's this?
Where's this? Where's this?

23:15.770 --> 23:17.740
Like, literally, I'm opening
my mouth to answer him,

23:17.762 --> 23:19.195
and he won't give me
a chance to speak.

23:19.319 --> 23:20.989
He's just frantic
and yelling for everything.

23:21.003 --> 23:22.704
One cod. I need it right now.
How long?

23:22.962 --> 23:23.919
Um...

23:24.584 --> 23:25.950
- Tommy!
- It's coming.

23:26.096 --> 23:29.217
One cod.
How long, Tommy?

23:29.349 --> 23:31.451
If they're already flustered,
it's not gonna do no point

23:31.483 --> 23:33.229
in screaming and yelling
at somebody.

23:33.244 --> 23:34.329
That's not leadership.

23:34.487 --> 23:36.209
- How long?
- Right, uh...

23:36.307 --> 23:38.334
- Tommy, talk to me!
- I'm listening to you.

23:38.361 --> 23:40.112
But you're not <i>talking</i>
to me!

23:40.309 --> 23:42.486
- I've answered you 1,000 times.
- No, you haven't!

23:46.384 --> 23:48.104
(Announcer)
Tonight, chef Ramsay is testing

23:48.127 --> 23:50.692
the final four's leadership
abilities running the pass.

23:51.091 --> 23:53.107
Right now,
Paul is in the hot seat.

23:53.201 --> 23:55.792
But with Tommy now
struggling on the fish station,

23:56.426 --> 23:57.726
Paul has lost his cool,

23:57.843 --> 24:01.289
and the kitchen, for the first time
tonight, it's a bit of a standstill.

24:01.401 --> 24:02.378
- Tommy, talk to me!
- I'm listening to you.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.986
But you're not <i>talking</i>
to me!

24:05.040 --> 24:06.617
(Tommy)
I've answered you 1,000 times.

24:06.649 --> 24:08.306
- No, you haven't!
- Two [Bleep] minutes!

24:08.398 --> 24:10.570
- Ah [Imitates explosion].
- Thank you!

24:10.601 --> 24:12.315
There's a difference
between asking for something

24:12.339 --> 24:13.881
and totally
bitching somebody out.

24:14.018 --> 24:15.015
Elise, can you
run this up?

24:16.622 --> 24:17.371
Thank you.

24:17.528 --> 24:20.400
(Announcer) With Tommy's cod finally
going out into the dining room...

24:20.501 --> 24:23.250
<i>- I apologize.</i>
<i>- Thank you ever so much.</i>

24:23.272 --> 24:25.082
(Announcer) Paul's turn
at the pass is over.

24:25.121 --> 24:27.666
- Okay, good.
- Thank you, chef.

24:28.188 --> 24:30.536
(Announcer) And it's time for
the next chef to be tested.

24:30.665 --> 24:32.123
Tommy, let's go!

24:32.201 --> 24:34.328
Chef Ramsay's been
on my case since I got here

24:34.390 --> 24:35.550
about being a quiet guy.

24:35.562 --> 24:37.464
Now I get to be loud guy
and prove to him

24:37.491 --> 24:39.335
that I can work the pass.
I'm excited.

24:39.366 --> 24:40.578
- Let's go.
- All right.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.660
Take the tickets with you.
Come on, let's go.

24:43.502 --> 24:44.943
All right, we got six top.

24:45.205 --> 24:48.056
Two mussel, two scallop,
one lobster capellini,

24:48.088 --> 24:49.807
- and one risotto.
(All) -  Yes, chef.

24:50.069 --> 24:53.326
I'm articulate and thorough when I
speak to my team when I'm on the line.

24:53.386 --> 24:54.920
Tommy, read me back
those apps again.

24:55.714 --> 24:57.363
Two mussels, two scallops...

24:57.430 --> 24:59.172
- I need the whole order.
- What?

24:59.210 --> 25:00.945
The whole big top.
I'm giving it to you right now.

25:00.982 --> 25:02.557
Don't interrupt me,
and I'll [Bleep] tell you!

25:03.849 --> 25:05.116
Hold on.
Let me look.

25:05.657 --> 25:08.659
Two mussel, two scallop,
one cap, one risotto.

25:08.671 --> 25:10.895
- Thank you.
- We two minutes out on that?

25:11.270 --> 25:12.301
Hold on one second.

25:12.463 --> 25:14.420
I didn't know what the hell
was going on.

25:14.488 --> 25:16.322
[Indistinct] For the scallops?
The con... what?

25:16.390 --> 25:17.898
What the [Bleep]
did you just say?

25:17.925 --> 25:19.393
[Garbled gibberish]
Okay!

25:19.507 --> 25:21.108
Got it?
<i>It's already out there.</i>

25:21.199 --> 25:22.728
(Tommy) How the hell did
that get over there?

25:22.760 --> 25:25.376
(Announcer) While Tommy attempts
to keep it together on the pass,

25:25.454 --> 25:27.756
out of the dining room,
James is about to deliver

25:27.792 --> 25:30.025
the next planned sabotage
of the night.

25:30.312 --> 25:31.174
Order in, four top.

25:31.175 --> 25:32.535
All right. Thank you, James.

25:32.585 --> 25:34.801
Coming in. Entrees are
one sea bass, one welly,

25:34.856 --> 25:36.790
one filet, and one cod.

25:37.175 --> 25:39.345
What?
What is a filet?

25:40.282 --> 25:41.570
Uh, no.
Good question.

25:41.601 --> 25:43.940
So why don't you go ask him and then come
back to me with the order, all right?

25:43.971 --> 25:45.861
There's no filet on the menu,
Tommy. Come on.

25:45.966 --> 25:47.747
Read them out
inin your mind first

25:47.763 --> 25:49.100
before you call them out.
<i>All right.</i>

25:49.123 --> 25:49.914
Hey, James.
Yes, chef.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.585
Who's making me read
[Bleep] here?

25:51.974 --> 25:53.357
Let me change that for you.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.535
(Announcer) It's an hour
into dinner service...

25:55.557 --> 25:57.758
They are coming. I do apologize
for the wait.

25:57.872 --> 25:59.630
(Announcer) And with a little
help from his chefs...

25:59.689 --> 26:01.423
Chef, walking up.
Walking with garnish.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.464
(Gordon) - Let's go.
- Thank you, Pauly.

26:03.506 --> 26:05.779
(Announcer) Tommy has managed
to push out appetizers...

26:05.842 --> 26:06.779
Thank you.

26:06.847 --> 26:09.248
Whoa. Yeah!
It's perfect.

26:09.316 --> 26:11.951
(Announcer) And is ready to
move his brigade on to entrees.

26:12.019 --> 26:13.391
All right.
Three wellys, one strip.

26:13.419 --> 26:14.549
A minute and a half
on garnish?

26:14.568 --> 26:16.720
No. You have two and half
minutes out on me,

26:16.740 --> 26:18.551
which means you got
two minutes out on garnish.

26:18.596 --> 26:20.789
Yeah, that's what I said.
You said a minute and a half.

26:23.129 --> 26:24.588
I don't think Tommy
did so hot,

26:24.619 --> 26:26.818
but we picked up the slack, and
we did what we needed to do.

26:26.849 --> 26:28.774
- You want it now?
- Yeah, bring it to me now.

26:28.775 --> 26:29.481
Walking.

26:30.183 --> 26:32.291
(Announcer) Despite Tommy's
uneven leadership...

26:32.442 --> 26:34.042
Put the food up.
Put your food up.

26:34.439 --> 26:35.617
Go. Complete these.

26:35.643 --> 26:37.305
Entrees are leaving
the kitchen.

26:37.342 --> 26:38.408
Mmm.

26:38.476 --> 26:39.565
Slow down.

26:39.592 --> 26:40.989
Slow the [Bleep] down
over there.

26:41.042 --> 26:43.710
Announcer: And is now time for someone
else to take over.

26:44.054 --> 26:45.950
Elise, you,
on the hot plate.

26:46.171 --> 26:48.277
She's gotta put her money
where her mouth is now.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.934
This is it, sweetheart.
Put up or shut up.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.420
You drive the tickets.

26:51.488 --> 26:53.422
That's what's going now.
Fire away. Let's go.

26:53.443 --> 26:55.473
Yes, chef.
Let me get your attention.

26:55.504 --> 26:57.260
Walking in I need one scallops,
one risotto.

26:57.279 --> 26:59.515
- How long to the window?
- Six minutes.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.397
- All right.
- Six minutes heard.

27:01.465 --> 27:03.374
I can run a kitchen,
I'm a great leader,

27:03.405 --> 27:05.136
and I'm gonna kick
some serious ass

27:05.155 --> 27:06.627
'cause they're not even
goa a see it coming.

27:06.641 --> 27:07.808
Scallops walking.

27:08.039 --> 27:09.406
(Announcer)
Elise is off and running.

27:09.639 --> 27:11.674
But what she doesn't know
is that a sabotage

27:11.690 --> 27:14.112
- awaits her at the pass.
- Let's go.

27:15.552 --> 27:16.878
Taste that.

27:17.664 --> 27:19.653
It's not even cauliflower,
it's potato puree.

27:19.654 --> 27:20.172
Yes, it is.

27:20.219 --> 27:22.691
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>- Why'd you put it on, then?</i>
 - Sorry, chef.

27:22.730 --> 27:23.715
I thought it was
cauliflower puree.

27:23.746 --> 27:25.089
You just tasted it.
Mm-hmm.

27:25.123 --> 27:26.465
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

27:26.503 --> 27:28.312
Look at me.
Talk to me.

27:29.427 --> 27:30.986
Oh, come on.

27:31.712 --> 27:34.313
I am very hard on myself,
and I can become emotional

27:34.361 --> 27:36.096
when something means
so much to me.

27:36.164 --> 27:37.838
You can't stop.
Come on!

27:37.885 --> 27:40.366
But I was, like, "damn that, I
refuse to shed a tear tonight."

27:40.434 --> 27:42.252
So right now I'm looking
for one sea bass,

27:42.276 --> 27:44.059
two Wellington... how long?

27:44.113 --> 27:45.604
One minute out, chef.
One minute out.

27:45.623 --> 27:46.543
<i>One minute on that.</i>

27:46.573 --> 27:47.542
I picked myself up,

27:47.569 --> 27:50.114
I dusted myself back off,
and we got the ball rolling.

27:50.152 --> 27:52.026
<i>(Elise)</i> <i> -  Potato puree.</i>
- Yep. Coming right up.

27:52.065 --> 27:53.924
(Announcer) Just as Elise
gets back on track,

27:53.955 --> 27:55.722
she's about to be tested again.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.783
Chef Scott has replaced
the potato mash

27:57.811 --> 27:59.470
with parsnip puree.

28:00.265 --> 28:02.677
(Man) Three sea bass and a new
York strip next. Yes, Will?

28:03.086 --> 28:05.006
This isn't mash.
This is parsnip.

28:05.007 --> 28:05.571
You sure?

28:05.610 --> 28:06.965
- Yes. Positive.
- Where did that come from?

28:06.983 --> 28:08.495
I don't know.
<i>You don't know?</i>

28:08.589 --> 28:10.862
- Well spotted. Hey, a great catch.
- Thank you.

28:10.947 --> 28:13.034
(Announcer) After rebounding
with her quality control,

28:13.065 --> 28:14.828
Elise is looking to set
a high standard

28:14.844 --> 28:16.311
for her turn at the pass.

28:16.535 --> 28:17.768
These look like [Bleep].

28:17.802 --> 28:19.524
- Tommy.
- What's up?

28:19.577 --> 28:21.945
Is this for real?
Look at it.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.574
It looks like it's been
chewed by your dog.

28:24.642 --> 28:27.010
Elise was trying to be a little
miniature chef Ramsay.

28:27.078 --> 28:29.646
There's only one chef Ramsay,
and one big mouth.

28:29.714 --> 28:31.448
I need another sea bass
the right way.

28:31.515 --> 28:32.649
Get it together.

28:32.717 --> 28:34.717
It'll be cooked right, babe.

28:34.785 --> 28:36.252
For real?

28:36.319 --> 28:38.721
First of all,
don't call me <i>babe.</i>

28:38.789 --> 28:40.790
Second of all,
give me some sea bass

28:40.858 --> 28:44.160
that ain't [Bleep] up.
Thank you.

28:44.228 --> 28:47.063
I'm sorry, but I have standards,
and that is not it.

28:47.131 --> 28:49.464
Good job. Great standards.
Thank you, chef.

28:49.531 --> 28:51.366
This is good. Quality
control perfect... let's go.

28:51.433 --> 28:52.400
I need my carrots yesterday!

28:52.468 --> 28:53.334
Right now.
Okay.

28:53.402 --> 28:56.104
Service!

28:59.175 --> 29:02.177
Bass, please.
And I'm looking for beignets.

29:02.245 --> 29:04.879
It felt good up there.
Once I got a rhythm

29:04.946 --> 29:06.947
of how the tickets
were supposed to go,

29:07.015 --> 29:07.714
I was, like,
I really like this.

29:07.783 --> 29:08.883
Potato puree, please.

29:08.950 --> 29:10.384
I'm dying in the window.

29:10.451 --> 29:11.752
Elise, you want me to slice?

29:11.820 --> 29:13.187
Slice.
<i>Slicing.</i>

29:13.255 --> 29:14.755
<i>(Elise)</i>
<i>Thank you, will.</i>

29:14.823 --> 29:16.090
This is my home right here.

29:16.158 --> 29:17.858
I was, like, ooh,
I like the feeling!

29:17.926 --> 29:19.760
That looks good. Service!

29:19.828 --> 29:22.028
Elise brought her game.

29:22.096 --> 29:24.597
(Gordon) Double check.
Let's go. Service mpmplete.

29:24.665 --> 29:25.731
The only thing I could do is
do everything in my power

29:25.800 --> 29:26.499
to make sure she doesn't win.

29:26.566 --> 29:28.201
I'm done? Okay.

29:28.269 --> 29:30.036
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Let's go, will.</i>

29:30.104 --> 29:31.337
Yes, chef.
<i>Well done, Elise.</i>

29:31.405 --> 29:32.672
Thank you, chef.
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

29:32.739 --> 29:34.240
We're going there...

29:34.308 --> 29:36.142
One sea bass, a couple wellys,
one New York strip. Yes?

29:36.210 --> 29:37.843
From there, [Indistinct]
Capellini, one scallops.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.912
Entree at the window.
Let's go.

29:39.979 --> 29:40.946
It's you telling them.
You're not asking them.

29:41.014 --> 29:43.148
All right, guys, listen up.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.817
Picking up one sea bass,
one cod, one welly, one strip.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.518
<i>- How long?</i>
- Four minutes.

29:46.585 --> 29:49.288
Four minutes heard.
Three and a half on garnish.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.422
Tonight is all about leadership.
It's all about being a leader.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.524
You can put me anywhere
in the kitchen,

29:52.591 --> 29:54.325
and I will succeed...
You know what I'm saying?

29:54.392 --> 29:56.194
(Announcer)
Will is off to a strong start,

29:56.261 --> 30:02.099
but chef Scott it preparing
his first quality control test.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.968
Chef, can you take that back

30:04.036 --> 30:05.136
and give me a beef
and not a lamb?

30:05.204 --> 30:07.004
- Which one's the lamb?
- That's the lamb.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.206
Thank you very much. And that's
not strip, that's hanger.

30:09.273 --> 30:10.006
Appreciate it,
though, chef.

30:10.074 --> 30:12.275
Good. Well-spoeded.

30:12.343 --> 30:14.311
(Announcer) Will has passed
chef Ramsay's first test.

30:14.378 --> 30:16.612
But his greatest test
may be in front of him.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.248
- Elise.
<i>- What?</i>

30:18.316 --> 30:22.185
How long on spinach?
It's coming right now.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.354
Why is there raw pasta
in the spinach?

30:24.421 --> 30:26.555
<i>(Elise)</i>
<i>You want me to do it over?</i>

30:26.622 --> 30:28.257
Yeah, I would love you
for you

30:28.325 --> 30:29.758
to do that spinach over,
please.

30:29.826 --> 30:31.160
(Gordon)
Good. Well spotted.

30:31.228 --> 30:32.895
What's raw pasta
doing in there?

30:32.963 --> 30:34.629
I don't know how
that got in there, sir.

30:34.697 --> 30:36.999
Elise, I think she's
a really, really shady female,

30:37.067 --> 30:39.201
and the second
she gets a chance,

30:39.269 --> 30:40.935
she's gonna stick a knife
right in your back.

30:41.003 --> 30:43.404
I just asked you to do
the spinach over 30 seconds ago.

30:43.472 --> 30:45.907
Why would you just take it
and put it onto another plate?

30:45.975 --> 30:47.508
Why are you being
an [Bleep]?

30:47.576 --> 30:49.377
I'm not. But I just asked you
to do it over 30 seconds ago.

30:51.546 --> 30:53.647
30 seconds for more.

30:53.715 --> 30:56.284
[Bleep]. Why would you put black
pepper in the [Bleep] potatoes?

30:56.352 --> 30:59.119
Are you deliberately trying
to [Bleep] me here or what?

30:59.187 --> 31:01.054
That was an accident.
<i>How was that an accident?</i>

31:01.122 --> 31:02.222
It's not [Bleep] day one!

31:02.290 --> 31:03.891
He's, like, "oh,
it's all about me,

31:03.958 --> 31:05.292
and you're trying
to [Bleep] me."

31:05.360 --> 31:06.693
I was like, nobody gives
a [Bleep] about you.

31:06.761 --> 31:08.561
Ready to slice anytime.
Sauce is ready.

31:08.629 --> 31:10.964
Don't try to [Bleep] me like this.
<i>I'm not.</i>

31:11.032 --> 31:11.765
You're the one that's trying
to [Bleep] me.

31:11.832 --> 31:13.665

31:25.612 --> 31:27.679
Yeah, I know.
If I had garnish,

Everybody stopped talking

through chef Ramsay's

32:24.153 --> 32:25.186
quality control test.

32:25.254 --> 32:26.555
But after battling
with Elise,

32:26.623 --> 32:28.056
his brigade
is in a bit of a funk.

I have no idea why people
weren't answering me.

32:36.665 --> 32:38.900
I just expect people
to answer me when I talk.

32:38.967 --> 32:40.301
But I definitely think that
Elise was down

32:40.368 --> 32:42.303
to sabotage me
the entire time.

<i>Come on, guys, let's go.</i>
<i>How long on three Wellingtons,</i>

- Paul, a minute, 30, slice the meat.
- Yes, chef.

Tommy, a minute, 15,
I want the fish. All right?

32:55.082 --> 32:57.684
(Elise) Will did a lot of
barking up on that pass.

32:57.752 --> 32:59.252
He needs to learn
some motivational techniques

32:59.320 --> 33:00.987
because he has zero.

33:01.055 --> 33:03.490
You're spotting the quality
control brilliantly.

is the team working for you.

Turn the [Bleep] out.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.946
Tonight was tough.

33:41.684 --> 33:43.385
And everybody had
their ups and downs.

33:44.504 --> 33:46.743
All of you
go back to the dorm

Get out of here.

33:58.885 --> 34:00.486
That was definetly
the biggest service so far.

34:00.544 --> 34:02.858
Probably the most important
of my life as a young chef.

34:03.046 --> 34:04.148
I'm happy about it.

34:04.171 --> 34:06.456
I think it went well
as a whole.

34:08.217 --> 34:10.083
I didn't think I did bad.
You think I did that bad?

34:11.887 --> 34:14.442
But honestly, do you guys
think I did all right?

34:15.558 --> 34:17.436
I thought I did decent,
right?

34:19.547 --> 34:21.659

as good as I thought.

Tough crowd.

34:24.514 --> 34:27.237

a good job tonight.

Hey, Elise.

Nothing I've done here

ever will be.

<i>I got respect for you.</i>

Because you're a tough chick,

and you want what you want.
You know what I'm saying?

34:40.539 --> 34:43.083
I feel like will feels now
that it's a competition.

He feels that I did
a good enough job tonight

34:45.518 --> 34:47.554

and he's scared.

34:47.621 --> 34:48.754
