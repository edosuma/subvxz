01:06.150 --> 01:07.486
This week alone,

01:07.487 --> 01:09.794
Shredder's probe modules
have surfaced here,

01:09.795 --> 01:11.499
here and here.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.636
Meaning what ?

01:12.637 --> 01:15.344
Meaning if we can
figure out a pattern,

01:15.345 --> 01:16.514
we might get a fix

01:16.515 --> 01:19.591
on the exact location
of the Technodrome.

01:19.592 --> 01:21.095
Like, all I care is

01:21.096 --> 01:23.537
it's down there, and we're up here.

01:23.538 --> 01:25.476
For now.

01:25.477 --> 01:27.216
But you never know what kind 
of scheme

01:27.217 --> 01:29.222
tin grin is cooking up next.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.961
You are right, Leonardo.

01:30.962 --> 01:32.900
Constant vigilance is the best 
weapon

01:32.901 --> 01:34.639
against tyrants.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.381
Still worried about
Shredder's next move, I see.

01:37.382 --> 01:38.919
Well, give your brains a rest

01:38.920 --> 01:41.661
and help me decide where
I should spend my vacation.

01:41.662 --> 01:43.500
Oh, a little r 'n' r, huh ?

01:43.501 --> 01:45.606
Yes, but these places
look so lovely

01:45.607 --> 01:48.081
I just can't make up my mind.

01:48.082 --> 01:51.592
To journey without a point is 
pointless.

01:51.593 --> 01:53.666
I hear Florida is nice this time 
of year.

01:54.903 --> 01:56.608
Hey, what's that shaking ?

01:56.609 --> 01:59.985
Talk about bad vibes.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.657
Do you suppose

02:01.658 --> 02:04.166
Krang is causing another 
earthquake ?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.502
We'd better get topside

02:05.503 --> 02:07.710
and find out what's going on.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.181
Come on, turtles !

02:09.181 --> 02:13.829
Wait for me !
I smell a news story.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.736
These are the sewers, you know.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.827
Like, how are we gonna find

02:23.828 --> 02:26.503
what's causing all this shaking ?

02:26.504 --> 02:30.549
I don't think that will be
too hard, Michelangelo.

02:33.325 --> 02:36.635
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

02:36.636 --> 02:40.580
Holy guacamole !
It's humongous !

02:40.581 --> 02:42.018
A dinosaur !

02:42.019 --> 02:44.660
It's a real, live dinosaur !

02:44.661 --> 02:46.967
A diplodocus, to be exact.

02:46.968 --> 02:50.044
They were, uh, are plant eaters.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.016
Huge, but harmless.

02:52.017 --> 02:55.393
Dude, you've got a really weird 
definition

02:55.394 --> 02:56.698
of harmless.

02:56.699 --> 02:59.975
Harmless or not, we've
got to stop that thing.

02:59.976 --> 03:02.851
Turtle power !

03:02.852 --> 03:05.559
He's what you might call
a cockeyed optimist.

03:06.864 --> 03:09.037
Let's scare it toward the river.

03:09.038 --> 03:11.143
I hate to be a spoil sport,

03:11.144 --> 03:13.485
but exactly how do we do that ?

03:13.486 --> 03:15.290
Yeah, I left my nuclear bazooka

03:15.291 --> 03:16.661
in my other shell.

03:16.662 --> 03:19.001
Get out !
Yeah, get out !

03:19.002 --> 03:21.844
Get out of here !
Go on !

03:30.138 --> 03:32.645
Boy, he really hung me out to dry.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.078
I think he wants to get down 
and party.

03:43.079 --> 03:45.552
Yeah, well, a 20-ton dinosaur

03:45.553 --> 03:47.558
can't party in the middle of the city.

03:50.903 --> 03:54.079
Watch out !
Runaway tail !

03:57.525 --> 03:58.995
Now what ?

03:58.996 --> 04:01.034
We've got to go after it.

04:01.035 --> 04:02.606
Like, how come ?

04:02.607 --> 04:03.944
'Cause if we didn't,

04:03.945 --> 04:06.117
it wouldn't be much of an episode.

04:06.118 --> 04:07.321
Oh, right.

04:08.793 --> 04:10.833
It's gone.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.604
Vanished completely.

04:12.605 --> 04:16.315
Well, at least he won't
be hard to follow.

04:20.262 --> 04:22.000
Help !

04:23.105 --> 04:25.613
Hey, way to go, Michelangelo.

04:25.614 --> 04:29.123
You solved the mystery
of the disappearing dinosaur.

04:29.124 --> 04:30.461
Forget about that !

04:30.462 --> 04:32.032
How about solving the case

04:32.033 --> 04:34.239
of the terrified turtle ?

04:34.240 --> 04:37.183
Where do you think it leads ?

04:37.184 --> 04:39.590
I don't know,
but we're going to find out.

04:39.591 --> 04:41.931
I was afraid he might say that.

04:47.114 --> 04:49.689
You incompetent imbeciles !

04:49.690 --> 04:51.427
Instead of that silly deplodocus,

04:51.428 --> 04:53.434
Why didn't you send up
something fierce

04:53.435 --> 04:55.138
to deal with the turtles...

04:55.139 --> 04:57.982
Like, a... Tyrannosaurus Rex ?

04:57.983 --> 04:59.453
Gee, boss,

04:59.454 --> 05:02.796
it ain't easy getting dinosaurs 
to obey.

05:02.797 --> 05:07.646
Yeah, they're all
muscle and no brains.

05:07.647 --> 05:09.485
I won't say it.

05:09.486 --> 05:10.655
It's too easy.

05:11.659 --> 05:12.795
What is it, Krang ?

05:12.796 --> 05:15.336
Stop that petty bickering

05:15.337 --> 05:17.543
and get on with what you came for !

05:17.544 --> 05:20.352
I'm still not certain
why you probed us up

05:20.353 --> 05:22.291
to this subterranean prehistoria ?

05:22.292 --> 05:24.699
I told you before...

05:24.700 --> 05:26.639
We need that crystal.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.548
Its radiation can
recharge our power cells,

05:29.549 --> 05:32.557
if we can cross the jungle

05:32.558 --> 05:35.032
and take possession of it.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.741
Simple.
We'll use one of

05:37.742 --> 05:40.382
the antigravitation skimmers.

05:40.383 --> 05:44.896
Really ? You're
in for a few surprises.

05:44.897 --> 05:48.140
Krang, you mustn't worry so much.

05:48.141 --> 05:49.277
You'll put lines

05:49.278 --> 05:51.785
in that handsome face of yours.

05:53.859 --> 05:56.299
All right, Shredder,

05:56.300 --> 05:58.473
Find out the hard way.

05:58.474 --> 06:00.679
It's your funeral.

06:03.990 --> 06:07.233
We're approaching
the crystal now, Krang.

06:08.238 --> 06:10.477
This will be a piece of cake.

06:13.053 --> 06:14.691
What's going on here ?

06:14.692 --> 06:17.600
Krang, the skimmer is losing power !

06:17.601 --> 06:19.774
I tried to warn you.

06:19.775 --> 06:21.378
The crystal's radiation

06:21.379 --> 06:24.522
canceled out the antigravity rays.

06:24.523 --> 06:26.394
I tried to tell you.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.568
But would you listen ?

06:28.569 --> 06:30.474
No !

06:36.494 --> 06:39.435
A piece of cake, someone said ?

06:39.436 --> 06:42.812
It looks more like
a mud pie to me !

06:45.188 --> 06:48.431
Sometimes I really crack myself up.

06:48.432 --> 06:52.142
I'm so glad you're amused, Krang.

06:52.143 --> 06:53.480
Have you figured out a way

06:53.481 --> 06:54.617
to get the crystal ?

06:54.618 --> 06:58.262
Rest assured,
I'm working on it.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.904
I don't believe it.

07:00.905 --> 07:03.478
A prehistoric world.

07:03.479 --> 07:05.518
Still in
The dinosaur stage.

07:05.519 --> 07:08.327
Sealed off
For millions of years.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.199
But how did
We get here ?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.874
I got a hunch one of
Shredder's modules

07:12.875 --> 07:14.847
Broke through
The outer chamber.

07:14.848 --> 07:15.884
Uh-oh,
Here comes

07:15.885 --> 07:18.191
One of their flying
Welcome wagons.

07:32.337 --> 07:34.108
Now i know

07:34.109 --> 07:37.586
What an anchovy
On my pizza feels like.

07:48.622 --> 07:50.895
Is that
What i think it is ?

07:50.896 --> 07:52.332
It sure is.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.640
A tyrannosaurus rex--

07:54.641 --> 07:56.345
The most
Ferocious flesh-eater

07:56.346 --> 07:57.750
That ever lived.

07:57.751 --> 08:00.324
Maybe this one's
A vegetarian.

08:03.435 --> 08:05.942
So much for that idea.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.198
Looks like they're
Fighting over lunch.

08:13.199 --> 08:15.807
I wonder if they'll fight
This hard over the check ?

08:15.808 --> 08:18.749
Let's not wait
Around to find out.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.164
Everybody ok ?

08:23.165 --> 08:26.741
I'll let you know as soon as my
Pulse catches up to me.

08:27.946 --> 08:29.183
Now what ?

08:29.184 --> 08:30.620
Whatever it is,

08:30.621 --> 08:32.058
Be ready for it !

08:34.366 --> 08:37.842
All right ! It's
The colossal fossil.

08:37.842 --> 08:40.284
It's ok.
He won't hurt us.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.457
Unless he climbs
Into our laps.

08:43.895 --> 08:45.935
Hey,
Chill, dude.

08:45.936 --> 08:47.741
That tickles.

08:47.742 --> 08:50.550
I think he likes you,
Michelangelo.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.505
This is great.

08:57.506 --> 08:58.976
Nobody's going
To mess with us

08:58.977 --> 09:01.016
While we're on
Dippy' back.

09:01.017 --> 09:02.153
Dippy ?

09:02.154 --> 09:04.159
Yeah, dippy
The diplodocus.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.330
Look !

09:05.331 --> 09:08.372
It look like a bunch
Of shredder's modules !

09:08.373 --> 09:09.410
You were right,
Donatello,

09:09.411 --> 09:11.382
They did break
Through the crust.

09:11.383 --> 09:13.790
Let's kick some shell.

09:13.791 --> 09:15.328
Hang on, guys.

09:15.329 --> 09:18.371
The diplodocus express
Is on its way.

09:24.625 --> 09:27.500
Since we can't
Use the skimmers

09:27.501 --> 09:29.004
To reach
The crystal,

09:29.005 --> 09:31.112
We'll just have
To do it on foot.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.284
All right, mutants,
Into the jungle.

09:33.285 --> 09:35.625
Sure thing, banana.

09:35.626 --> 09:38.502
That's bwana.
Now, move it.

09:43.819 --> 09:47.195
Every day,
The same boring image.

09:47.196 --> 09:50.941
Maybe i should think
About subscribing to cable.

09:50.942 --> 09:53.348
Wait. What's this ?

09:53.349 --> 09:54.552
The turtles !

09:54.553 --> 09:56.892
How did they get there ?

09:56.893 --> 09:58.364
No matter.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.105
I'll send
Those interfering reptiles

10:01.106 --> 10:03.079
A welcoming committee.

10:18.562 --> 10:20.400
Faster, my slaves.

10:20.401 --> 10:21.906
Faster !

10:21.907 --> 10:24.313
At last, a fortress

10:24.314 --> 10:28.025
That even the turtles
Cannot overwhelm.

10:31.904 --> 10:34.144
And should they try,

10:34.145 --> 10:37.354
They'll be
In for a few surprises.

10:45.715 --> 10:47.786
Rock soldiers.

10:47.788 --> 10:49.960
And they're headed
Straight for us !

10:49.961 --> 10:51.231
Hey, no problem.

10:51.232 --> 10:52.769
Dippy will
Take care of them.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.421
That blasted dinosaur.

10:58.422 --> 11:00.427
I'll show him

11:00.428 --> 11:03.469
Who's the dominant
Life form around here.

11:12.566 --> 11:15.274
Tar !

11:15.275 --> 11:16.645
Yeah,
And we're, like,

11:16.646 --> 11:18.350
Sinking deeper.

11:18.351 --> 11:19.788
Don't give up.

11:19.789 --> 11:21.293
Maybe someone
Will come along

11:21.294 --> 11:22.497
And pull us out.

11:22.498 --> 11:24.503
Right.
Like some archaeologist,

11:24.504 --> 11:26.777
50 million
Years from now.

11:28.182 --> 11:29.854
Dippy,
All is forgiven.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.461
Just get us
Out of this.

11:34.836 --> 11:36.741
Thanks, big guy.

11:36.742 --> 11:38.715
Oh, and i thought

11:38.716 --> 11:41.590
Melted mozzarella
Was gooey.

11:47.109 --> 11:48.746
Hey, where's
Michelangelo ?

11:49.851 --> 11:51.923
Now you know
What you'll get

11:51.924 --> 11:53.862
If you cross a turtle
With a turkey.

11:53.863 --> 11:57.207
That is
Oh so humoroso.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.614
Following dinosaurs
Into large holes

11:59.615 --> 12:01.821
Wasn't a very smart plan.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.159
Donatello's right.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.131
Even with
Dippy's help,

12:05.132 --> 12:07.238
We can't keep up
With those modules.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.039
So much for dinosaurs.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.045
Now down to business.

12:20.046 --> 12:23.556
Rock steady, bebop,
Get that crystal.

12:23.557 --> 12:25.462
All right, boss.

12:33.455 --> 12:35.260
You clumsy cretins.

12:35.261 --> 12:37.467
It's too slick,
Boss. 

12:37.468 --> 12:39.774
We can't climb it.

12:39.775 --> 12:42.516
Ooh,
I got a idea.

12:44.122 --> 12:46.295
Neat idea.

12:46.296 --> 12:48.267
Stop, stop, stop !

12:49.473 --> 12:51.143
Look at that !

12:51.144 --> 12:54.053
Those look
Like laser beams.

12:54.054 --> 12:56.126
Yeah. Either
These dino dudes

12:56.127 --> 12:58.634
Are putting on
A light show or...

12:58.635 --> 13:00.139
Or shredder
And his gang

13:00.140 --> 13:02.011
Are up to
Their old tricks.

13:02.012 --> 13:04.686
Let's go, dippy. Mush.

13:09.068 --> 13:13.080
You idiots could have
Blasted it to pieces !

13:13.081 --> 13:15.855
Now, treat that
Crystal gently.

13:15.856 --> 13:18.196
Almost got it, boss.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.470
Watch it !

13:26.556 --> 13:28.060
Got it !

13:28.061 --> 13:30.568
And we've got you,
Shredder !

13:30.569 --> 13:32.976
The turtles !

13:32.977 --> 13:35.951
Even in the lost world
I can't lose you.

13:35.952 --> 13:38.961
This microwave ray
Will assure them

13:38.962 --> 13:41.067
Of a warm reception.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.722
The lava !
It's melting !

13:49.729 --> 13:53.240
There's never an ice age around
When you need one.

13:56.451 --> 14:00.830
Help !

14:03.573 --> 14:07.351
Rock steady, bebop,
Follow me.

14:07.352 --> 14:10.862
And i wanted
To watch the turtles

14:10.863 --> 14:12.801
Get their lava lumps.

14:15.210 --> 14:19.556
This way, dippy.
You can do it.

14:19.557 --> 14:21.797
Atta boy.
Way to go.

14:21.798 --> 14:25.074
You did it !
Hooray, dippy !

14:25.075 --> 14:26.445
We made it !

14:26.446 --> 14:27.581
But just barely.

14:27.582 --> 14:29.855
I'm a mere shell
Of my former self.

14:29.856 --> 14:31.026
Quick, donatello !

14:31.027 --> 14:33.701
Shredder and his henchmutants
Are getting away !

14:33.702 --> 14:36.276
You heard him, dippy.
Huh ?

14:39.787 --> 14:44.234
It's the crystal
That was up there.

14:48.415 --> 14:49.918
Oh, more than that.

14:49.919 --> 14:53.664
I've got a feeling that
Crystal's a source of life

14:53.665 --> 14:55.937
To the creatures here
In this prehistoric world.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.613
Without it,
They just might perish.

15:00.186 --> 15:03.495
So, like, what
Are we waiting for ?

15:03.496 --> 15:06.003
Yeah.
Let's get it back.

15:16.169 --> 15:19.947
Here it is, krang--
Your precious crystal.

15:19.948 --> 15:22.355
Well,
It's about time.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.093
Shredder,

15:24.094 --> 15:27.203
This crystal
Is exactly like you.

15:27.204 --> 15:29.477
You mean
It's flawless ?

15:29.478 --> 15:32.219
No. I mean
It's cracked !

15:32.220 --> 15:33.724
A crack ? Where ?

15:33.725 --> 15:35.228
Right there.

15:35.229 --> 15:37.737
Shredder, you
Metal-faced moron,

15:37.738 --> 15:39.911
This ruins
Everything.

15:39.912 --> 15:41.917
A crack like this
Will distort

15:41.918 --> 15:44.759
The crystal's
Molecular harmonics.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.537
Its entire energy flow
Will be flawed.

15:48.538 --> 15:50.042
This is all your fault.

15:50.044 --> 15:52.383
I told you to
Handle it carefully.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.520
But, boss,

15:53.521 --> 15:56.228
You was the one
Who dropped it.

15:56.229 --> 15:57.633
Quiet, you idiot !

15:57.634 --> 16:00.977
Stop your squabbling,
All of you !

16:00.978 --> 16:02.983
I see once again

16:02.985 --> 16:07.430
I'll have to save
Your pathetic posteriors.

16:14.755 --> 16:17.696
Poor thing. He's really
Taking this hard.

16:17.697 --> 16:18.933
Really.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.441
It's like he's got a heavy
Relationship going

16:21.442 --> 16:23.883
With that glowing
Disco ball.

16:23.884 --> 16:25.287
But why does
Shredder and krang

16:25.288 --> 16:26.490
Want the crystal ?

16:26.491 --> 16:27.494
They're probably planning

16:27.495 --> 16:29.166
To use
Its special properties

16:29.167 --> 16:31.172
To power up
The technodrome.

16:31.173 --> 16:33.145
That means we've got
To break into

16:33.146 --> 16:35.352
That fortress of krang's
And get it back.

16:35.353 --> 16:37.258
How do we get
In there ?

16:37.259 --> 16:39.599
That's a good question,
April.

16:41.271 --> 16:44.214
A little more
To the right.

16:44.215 --> 16:46.521
Don't you have
Anything better to do

16:46.522 --> 16:48.059
Than comment ?

16:48.060 --> 16:49.597
Actually, no.

16:49.598 --> 16:52.005
I've already set up
Foot and rock soldier patrols

16:52.006 --> 16:53.308
Around the fortress.

16:53.309 --> 16:55.047
Good idea.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.656
I'm surprised
You thought of it.

16:59.429 --> 17:01.836
Now what ?

17:01.837 --> 17:05.346
Someone or something's
Pounding on the hull.

17:05.347 --> 17:06.684
Whoever it is,

17:06.685 --> 17:08.925
Tell them
We don't want any.

17:11.634 --> 17:13.773
We're not getting
Anywhere this way.

17:13.775 --> 17:14.777
I'm not surprised.

17:14.778 --> 17:16.849
The walls
Are 3 feet thick

17:16.851 --> 17:18.119
And pure titanium.

17:20.829 --> 17:23.404
Nice try, dippy,
But no cigar.

17:23.405 --> 17:27.684
I hate to admit it,
But we turtles need help.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.974
What's that rumbling noise ?

17:34.975 --> 17:37.382
For once, it's not
Michelangelo's stomach.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.665
Oh, what's going on ?

17:42.666 --> 17:45.005
I think i know.
Watch.

18:00.689 --> 18:04.100
Looks like dippy
Called in heavy hitters !

18:05.437 --> 18:08.212
They're busting in.

18:08.213 --> 18:12.426
Impossible. No one can
Break into this place.

18:15.536 --> 18:18.512
Krang !
Use the laser cannons !

18:18.513 --> 18:22.089
I can't. I need
All the power here.

18:24.632 --> 18:27.273
Turtle power !
Turtle power !

18:37.639 --> 18:41.952
It's every mutant
For himself !

18:41.953 --> 18:44.828
Try to beat
A strategic retreat,

18:44.829 --> 18:46.701
But with dignity.

18:50.012 --> 18:52.285
What a
Glorious mess.

18:52.286 --> 18:54.124
Exactamundo.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.130
Just like
My bedroom.

18:56.131 --> 18:58.136
Come on, we've got
To stop krang

18:58.137 --> 19:00.645
Before he uses
That crystal.

19:07.434 --> 19:08.736
It's fixed.

19:08.737 --> 19:10.141
Now to use it

19:10.142 --> 19:13.852
To recharge the
Technodrome's power cells.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.090
Never mind
The crystal.

19:15.091 --> 19:16.595
We've got
Bigger problems.

19:16.596 --> 19:19.671
What could be
Bigger than this ?

19:23.986 --> 19:25.757
I rest my case.

19:26.829 --> 19:29.469
Don't touch
That dial, dude !

19:29.470 --> 19:31.977
You're too late,
Turtles.

19:31.978 --> 19:34.485
I'm recharging
The technodrome

19:34.486 --> 19:36.993
At this very moment.

19:38.499 --> 19:40.738
Haven't you heard,
Brain bag ?

19:40.739 --> 19:42.076
It's never too late.

19:46.524 --> 19:48.897
Wee shah ooh baah !

19:48.898 --> 19:51.104
It ain't going
To be that easy,

19:51.105 --> 19:53.077
Shell backs !

19:56.254 --> 19:58.427
Quick.
Grab the crystal.

19:58.428 --> 19:59.965
Not so fast, turtles.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.206
You must still
Deal with me.

20:02.207 --> 20:04.446
Turtles fight
With honor.

20:04.447 --> 20:07.623
Yes,
But i fight dirty.

20:11.569 --> 20:13.307
I got it !

20:13.308 --> 20:15.415
Yeah, you mean
You had it.

20:15.416 --> 20:18.257
Hey ! Pass interference !

20:18.258 --> 20:20.664
To me, rocky !
I'm open !

20:25.113 --> 20:33.638
Intercepted in the end zone
By the green machine.

20:33.639 --> 20:36.547
Cowabunga !

20:38.622 --> 20:40.293
They're getting away !

20:40.294 --> 20:43.737
Correction--
They've gotten away.

20:43.738 --> 20:46.746
And it's back to the
Technodrome for us.

20:46.747 --> 20:50.224
Shredder,
You're benched !

20:50.225 --> 20:53.200
Oh, i was afraid
You'd say that.

20:57.448 --> 20:58.885
There, good as new.

20:58.886 --> 21:01.727
This tar
Makes a perfect patch.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.132
Thanks for the help, dippy.

21:03.133 --> 21:05.807
Now that the crystal
Is back where it belongs,

21:05.808 --> 21:08.716
It's time for us to head
back up to the surface.

21:08.717 --> 21:10.355
So long, big fella.

21:12.663 --> 21:13.665
Poor dippy.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.504
He's really gonna miss us.

21:15.505 --> 21:17.778
Hey, April, maybe you ought to

21:17.779 --> 21:19.751
come back here for your vacation.

21:19.752 --> 21:22.760
To a prehistoric continent ?

21:22.761 --> 21:25.135
Sure. What more could you ask for ?

21:25.136 --> 21:28.011
You've got gorgeous tropical sunsets.

21:28.012 --> 21:31.388
Yeah. And warm, loving friends.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.975
And flights leaving every half hour.

21:37.976 --> 21:39.346
Hey, come on !

21:39.347 --> 21:41.520
Let's get her back here !

21:41.521 --> 21:42.691
Help !
