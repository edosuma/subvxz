WEBVTT

00:01.029 --> 00:02.196
Attention, boys and ghouls.

00:02.231 --> 00:03.831
Nope.

00:03.866 --> 00:05.600
Every Halloween, I dress up
in an amazing costume,

00:05.601 --> 00:07.402
and you never get what I am.
<i>No, we get what you are...</i>

00:07.436 --> 00:09.837
An adult man
who enjoys dress-up.

00:09.872 --> 00:11.139
Very funny, Rosa.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.474
This year,
that won't be a problem

00:13.475 --> 00:15.877
because you're gonna
pick my costume.

00:19.448 --> 00:20.882
Uh, Ms. Pac-man's nipple.

00:20.916 --> 00:22.517
No, that's brown.

00:22.551 --> 00:23.584
Why would you know that?

00:23.619 --> 00:26.721
To be or not to be!
Not to be.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.056
Thank you.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.359
Joan of Arc.
Rod Stewart.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.360
Martha Stewart.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.695
He-man!
Master of the universe.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.697
I got it.
Gay Robin Hood.

00:36.698 --> 00:37.865
Yes!

00:37.900 --> 00:39.133
<i>That's it, that's it.</i>

00:39.134 --> 00:41.402
<i>That's what it is.</i>

01:06.528 --> 01:08.563
Oh, hey there, captain.

01:08.564 --> 01:11.065
Just curious, do you happen
to know what today is?

01:11.066 --> 01:13.601
Well, based on the fact that
yesterday was the birthday

01:13.602 --> 01:15.903
of legendary Dutch flautist
Frans Bruggen,

01:15.938 --> 01:18.573
and a week ago it was october
24th, it's say today is...

01:18.607 --> 01:19.841
It's Halloween.
Just say it's Halloween.

01:19.842 --> 01:21.008
It's Halloween.

01:21.009 --> 01:23.177
All right, and what
happened last Halloween?

01:23.178 --> 01:24.545
Oh, I listened to the CD
I bought the night before,

01:24.546 --> 01:25.980
the Frans Bruggen
birthday concert.

01:26.014 --> 01:27.715
Please stop saying Bruggen.

01:27.716 --> 01:30.118
Last year, you bet me that you
could steal my medal of valor.

01:30.152 --> 01:31.819
And you did.

01:31.820 --> 01:34.389
Consequently, I was forced to
do your paperwork for a week

01:34.390 --> 01:37.592
and to say words I thought
I'd never have to say.

01:37.626 --> 01:41.935
Jake Peralta is an amazing
detective/genius.

01:41.964 --> 01:44.232
But now it's time for round two
of our Halloween bet.

01:44.266 --> 01:45.867
This year,
I believe I'll make things

01:45.868 --> 01:47.468
more difficult for myself.

01:47.469 --> 01:51.639
Let's say, what, I'll steal
the watch right off your wrist.

01:51.673 --> 01:53.207
Or we could just not do it
at all this year.

01:53.242 --> 01:54.976
What?

01:54.977 --> 01:59.247
Sir, with all due respect,
come on, homey! No?

01:59.248 --> 02:00.648
It's not worth all the trouble,

02:00.649 --> 02:02.984
just so you might call me
an amazing captain/genius

02:02.985 --> 02:05.319
and give me one week
of overtime for free.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.088
All right, fine,
I'll double the overtime.

02:07.089 --> 02:08.156
<i>I'll triple it!</i>

02:08.190 --> 02:09.490
<i>I'll quadruple it!</i>

02:09.525 --> 02:10.525
I will five-druple it.

02:10.526 --> 02:13.175
I'll five-druple the overtime.

02:13.195 --> 02:14.195
Got his attention.

02:14.196 --> 02:16.364
He's coming back to me.

02:16.365 --> 02:17.498
Just to clarify.

02:17.499 --> 02:19.467
If you steal my watch
by midnight,

02:19.468 --> 02:20.802
I will do your paperwork
for a week,

02:20.836 --> 02:22.704
but if you fail,
you will give me

02:22.705 --> 02:26.307
five weeks of overtime for free.

02:26.341 --> 02:28.109
Correct.

02:28.143 --> 02:30.311
I'm doing a cost-benefit
analysis in my head.

02:30.345 --> 02:32.447
The benefits outweigh the costs.

02:32.448 --> 02:34.082
We have reached an accord.

02:34.116 --> 02:35.450
Accords!

02:35.484 --> 02:38.019
Handing out these safety
pumpkins to neighborhood kids

02:38.053 --> 02:40.254
is a cornerstone
in community relations.

02:40.255 --> 02:41.489
And putting them together

02:41.523 --> 02:43.891
is a boring-stone
in testing my patience.

02:43.926 --> 02:46.561
We can use an assembly line
so it'll go quicker.

02:46.595 --> 02:47.929
Ooh, that's a great idea,
Terrence.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.498
However, is there any way
I can skip doing that

02:50.499 --> 02:52.266
and instead, not do that?

02:52.301 --> 02:54.736
I have an urgent matter
to attend to.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.437
Okay, no problem.

02:56.472 --> 02:57.872
<i>Just come back and help us
when you're done.</i>

02:57.873 --> 02:58.940
Thank you.

02:58.974 --> 03:00.742
I'll leave you guys with this.

03:00.776 --> 03:05.246
One-duhl plus one-duhl equals...
Tootles.

03:06.648 --> 03:09.817
Seriously, sarge?
You're just gonna let her go?

03:09.852 --> 03:12.620
Look, a year ago, I would've
been thinking the same thing,

03:12.621 --> 03:15.356
but I've learned to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

03:15.391 --> 03:16.591
What kind of urgent matter

03:16.592 --> 03:18.226
could Gina possibly
have to attend to?

03:18.227 --> 03:19.594
She's already
checked herself out

03:19.595 --> 03:21.729
in every reflective surface
around the precinct.

03:21.764 --> 03:23.531
<i>Including my lip gloss.</i>

03:23.532 --> 03:25.867
She said she looked better
when I frowned.

03:30.539 --> 03:32.573
I was behind the door!

03:32.574 --> 03:35.209
<i>Greetings, comrades, and welcome</i>

03:35.244 --> 03:37.612
to the most important
briefing of your lives.

03:37.646 --> 03:39.013
<i>As you all know,</i>

03:39.014 --> 03:40.982
the Holt-Peralta
Halloween bet has been made,

03:40.983 --> 03:43.484
and the clock doth tick.

03:43.519 --> 03:44.819
What's with the tux?

03:44.853 --> 03:46.421
I decided to class up
this year's event.

03:46.422 --> 03:47.822
I bought it off
a disgraced magician,

03:47.823 --> 03:50.358
and it is chock-full of scarves.

03:52.261 --> 03:53.361
What? How?

03:53.395 --> 03:55.029
A real magician
never tells, young man.

03:55.064 --> 03:56.397
<i>Now, let's get started.</i>

03:56.398 --> 03:58.299
<i>I've been planning this
for three months.</i>

03:58.334 --> 04:00.668
You've all been given
a specific role and a code name.

04:00.703 --> 04:01.936
<i>Rosa, you're the dagger.</i>

04:01.937 --> 04:03.671
<i>Sarge, the hammer.</i>

04:03.672 --> 04:05.340
<i>Amy, the hall monitor.</i>

04:05.341 --> 04:07.041
Yeah, suck it!

04:07.042 --> 04:08.710
Scully and Hitchcock,
I'm just gonna call you

04:08.711 --> 04:10.011
your real names
so you don't get confused.

04:10.045 --> 04:11.846
Smart.
What?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.815
And, Boyle, as requested,
you will be the deuce.

04:13.816 --> 04:14.916
Although I still think

04:14.917 --> 04:15.950
you should reconsider
that code name.

04:15.985 --> 04:17.418
Nope, deuce.

04:17.418 --> 04:19.286
It's like ace,
but twice as cool.

04:19.321 --> 04:20.721
It is not.
It's a turd.

04:20.755 --> 04:22.323
<i>Now, because of last year,</i>

04:22.358 --> 04:23.858
the captain will suspect
that you are all helping me,

04:23.859 --> 04:25.526
so we will never get
anywhere near his watch,

04:25.527 --> 04:28.730
but the actual theft
will be pulled off

04:28.731 --> 04:33.201
by Dan McCreary, aka "fingers."

04:33.202 --> 04:35.370
How you doing?

04:35.404 --> 04:36.938
Call me "fingers."

04:36.939 --> 04:38.806
<i>Hey, I remember this guy.</i>

04:38.807 --> 04:40.241
<i>That's probably because</i>

04:40.242 --> 04:41.576
<i>you've arrested him twice
for pickpocketing.</i>

04:41.610 --> 04:43.144
<i>You have a criminal helping you?</i>

04:43.178 --> 04:44.779
That's crazy!

04:44.813 --> 04:45.947
Grow up, Amy.

04:45.948 --> 04:47.615
Now, we will all
work together as a team

04:47.616 --> 04:48.950
to move the captain
into position.

04:48.951 --> 04:51.052
Once there, fingers...
Loving that code name...

04:51.086 --> 04:52.820
<i>Will remove the captain's watch</i>

04:52.855 --> 04:55.490
and replace it
with this replica watch.

04:55.491 --> 04:58.092
Oh, that is a very dead dove.

04:58.093 --> 04:59.093
Ooh!

04:59.094 --> 05:00.628
<i>All right...</i>

05:00.663 --> 05:03.197
This replica watch.

05:03.232 --> 05:04.432
Jake, if he's been
arrested before,

05:04.433 --> 05:05.533
how do you know he's any good?

05:05.567 --> 05:07.335
Perhaps this will
answer your question.

05:07.336 --> 05:08.369
Fingers!

05:10.639 --> 05:11.706
Whoa.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.641
That's our stuff.

05:13.642 --> 05:15.209
My croissant.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.045
But where's the smoked Turkey?

05:17.079 --> 05:18.246
Check your breast pocket?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.181
Come on!

05:21.250 --> 05:23.618
<i>Let's win this bet!</i>

05:26.188 --> 05:27.488
Salutations, captain.

05:27.523 --> 05:30.592
I was wondering perchance

05:30.626 --> 05:32.894
if you would like to attend
the opera with me this Eve.

05:32.895 --> 05:34.062
<i>I'll pass,</i>

05:34.096 --> 05:36.197
choosing instead
to stay in my locked office

05:36.198 --> 05:39.901
with my watch still safely
on my wrist.

05:39.902 --> 05:41.736
<i>I had a feeling
you might say that.</i>

05:41.770 --> 05:45.473
Thusfore, I have decided
to bring the opera to you.

05:45.507 --> 05:47.642
Hitchcock, Scully!

05:47.676 --> 05:52.981
♪ Oooo fortuna ♪

05:55.384 --> 05:57.285
Now, hammer, it's time.

05:57.286 --> 05:59.921
It's hammer time.
I love life.

06:01.657 --> 06:04.197
You're up, dagger.

06:04.226 --> 06:05.226
No need for the somersaults.

06:05.227 --> 06:07.095
Disagree.

06:07.096 --> 06:10.064
<i>Hall monitor, now!</i>

06:13.102 --> 06:15.703
Okay, Boyle, and only because
you insisted I say this,

06:15.738 --> 06:16.905
it's time to drop a deuce.

06:20.576 --> 06:23.311
And now, the Jake and bake.

06:29.552 --> 06:30.852
Whoa, come on, Amy!
Not cool!

06:30.853 --> 06:31.953
That's a guy!

06:31.987 --> 06:33.855
Peralta, that's enough!

06:37.426 --> 06:39.260
<i>Sir, sir.</i>

06:39.295 --> 06:40.528
I'm so sorry.

06:40.529 --> 06:42.597
I just wanted somebody
to check my son's candy.

06:42.631 --> 06:45.500
Please, let me help you up.

06:45.534 --> 06:47.302
On behalf of the nine-nine,
I apologize.

06:47.336 --> 06:49.637
<i>Fingers has grabbed
the package.</i>

06:49.638 --> 06:51.906
I didn't mean for that
to sound so dirty.

06:51.941 --> 06:54.742
<i>I'll have someone check your
son's bag of candy immediately.</i>

06:54.777 --> 06:58.279
Clark.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.447
Thank you, sir.

06:59.481 --> 07:03.017
If you need anything,
please, contact me.

07:03.052 --> 07:04.752
I'll do that.
Thank you.

07:04.753 --> 07:05.787
<i>The replica is on the wrist.</i>

07:05.788 --> 07:07.856
Game over.

07:07.857 --> 07:09.324
I know all this was done
in the spirit of a friendly bet,

07:09.325 --> 07:10.859
but this all went too far.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.394
Am I understood?

07:13.395 --> 07:14.796
Peralta!
Yes, sir.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.098
Completely understood, sir.
I'm sorry.

07:19.134 --> 07:22.170
But not as sorry as you're
going to be at midnight,

07:22.171 --> 07:26.441
when you realize
you've lost everything.

07:29.545 --> 07:30.645
Hello there, Hank.

07:30.679 --> 07:32.547
<i>I believe a tall,
nimble-fingered man</i>

07:32.548 --> 07:34.949
named McCreary left
a package for me.

07:34.984 --> 07:37.185
Yeah, it's here. Give me a sec.
Thanks.

07:37.219 --> 07:39.554
Ooh, I'm gonna make a movie
of you receiving the watch.

07:39.555 --> 07:41.022
Here.

07:41.023 --> 07:43.057
Let me pinch your lips
and make fulsome.

07:43.058 --> 07:44.425
Don't touch my face.

07:44.426 --> 07:46.094
Fine, but if you have
dull lips, that's on you.

07:46.095 --> 07:47.795
This is Charles Boyle
for Jake action news.

07:47.830 --> 07:48.963
Thank you.

07:48.964 --> 07:49.964
Okay, open the box.

07:49.965 --> 07:52.433
Here we go!

07:52.468 --> 07:54.769
That's weird, it's just a note.

07:54.803 --> 07:56.171
"Thanks for the watch"?

07:56.172 --> 07:57.772
Oh, no!

07:57.773 --> 07:59.841
McCreary stole
the captain's watch!

07:59.875 --> 08:02.110
Breaking news, there's been
a terrible development.

08:02.111 --> 08:04.279
Not now, Charles.

08:04.313 --> 08:07.315
Good call.
Media blackout.

08:09.225 --> 08:11.060
We're okay.
It's not over yet.

08:11.094 --> 08:12.861
I still have two hours
to find fingers

08:12.862 --> 08:14.029
and get Holt's watch back.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.297
But how?
He could be anywhere.

08:15.298 --> 08:17.032
He could be in Canada by now.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.367
There are so many
forests up there.

08:18.368 --> 08:21.103
That country is one
giant hiding place.

08:21.137 --> 08:22.738
Boyle, I kinda need you to be
positive right now, okay?

08:22.772 --> 08:24.473
Yes, sorry.
Damn my mouth.

08:24.474 --> 08:26.041
All right, let's look up
McCreary's arrest records,

08:26.042 --> 08:28.711
past addresses,
known associates.

08:28.745 --> 08:30.145
Peralta.

08:30.146 --> 08:32.181
Run, deuce, run.

08:32.215 --> 08:34.249
If you'll excuse me, sir,
I have to...

08:34.250 --> 08:36.418
Make urines in de toilet.

08:36.419 --> 08:38.643
Yeah, that's how
people say words.

08:38.655 --> 08:39.888
I'd like to ask a favor.

08:39.889 --> 08:41.523
Can we please press pause
on this bet for ten minutes?

08:41.524 --> 08:42.725
Sure, or we could press
fast-forward,

08:42.759 --> 08:44.626
and I could watch you
talk like a chipmunk.

08:44.627 --> 08:47.529
Peralta, I'm very
disappointed in you.

08:47.564 --> 08:48.964
Yes, that would be very funny.

08:48.965 --> 08:50.432
How do you ruin everything?

08:50.467 --> 08:51.867
Kevin is bringing dinner for me,

08:51.868 --> 08:53.469
and I don't think he'd
appreciate this bet we made.

08:53.470 --> 08:55.571
This watch was given to me
by his father

08:55.605 --> 08:56.872
just before he died.

08:56.906 --> 08:59.508
Oh!
A death watch, cool.

08:59.542 --> 09:00.509
Please, never call it that.

09:00.543 --> 09:01.844
Copy that.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.045
Oh, you know what?

09:03.046 --> 09:04.380
You can have the ten minutes,
no problem.

09:04.381 --> 09:06.048
Love you, bye.

09:06.049 --> 09:08.217
Boyle, fingers just texted.

09:08.218 --> 09:09.585
He said he wants to meet up.

09:09.619 --> 09:11.153
Yes.
Let's get outta here.

09:11.187 --> 09:12.554
Be cool.
Holt's watching.

09:12.555 --> 09:14.762
Pretend I just said
something really funny.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.527
Get outta here.
We gotta go.

09:21.731 --> 09:23.499
Enjoy the vest and the light.

09:23.500 --> 09:28.170
You'll be so safe,
it's scary.

09:28.204 --> 09:29.204
Lame.

09:29.239 --> 09:30.973
That kid gets it.

09:30.974 --> 09:33.008
<i>Thanks for finally
joining us, Gina.</i>

09:33.009 --> 09:35.511
We had to stuff 400
of these things without you.

09:35.545 --> 09:36.712
Great seeing you guys.

09:36.713 --> 09:38.280
Unfortunately,
I cannot stay long.

09:38.281 --> 09:40.783
I just came to grab
a healthy snack.

09:40.784 --> 09:41.950
Got it.

09:41.985 --> 09:43.519
I'm still tending
to that urgent matter

09:43.520 --> 09:44.920
I was talking about earlier.

09:44.954 --> 09:46.689
Which is what exactly?

09:46.690 --> 09:50.225
Hmm, funny you should ask, you
inquisitive litter ferret.

09:50.260 --> 09:52.361
I've been practicing
my dance moves.

09:52.362 --> 09:54.930
♪ If you wanna be with me ♪

09:54.931 --> 09:56.832
♪ Baby there's a price ♪

09:56.833 --> 09:58.167
My dance troupe, floorgasm,

09:58.168 --> 10:01.670
is performing tonight in
the boooo-ty shake grand prix.

10:01.705 --> 10:04.006
Gina, what the hell?

10:04.007 --> 10:06.275
I defended you,
and your urgent matter

10:06.276 --> 10:09.578
was just practicing
for some stupid dance show?

10:09.612 --> 10:12.014
Look, I can't help it
if my life is literally

10:12.015 --> 10:13.349
a <i> step up</i> movie.

10:13.383 --> 10:14.483
Oh, is it?

10:14.484 --> 10:15.984
Then I suggest
you think of this moment

10:15.985 --> 10:17.720
as the montage
where you buckle down

10:17.721 --> 10:21.123
and take your job seriously so
your boss doesn't kill you.

10:21.157 --> 10:23.392
<i>Fine, then I suggest
you figure out</i>

10:23.426 --> 10:25.027
how to turn on
all these sprinklers

10:25.028 --> 10:27.730
'cause I'm about
to tell a story.

10:31.334 --> 10:32.868
Okay, fingers
wants us to meet him

10:32.869 --> 10:34.903
in that alley over there.

10:34.904 --> 10:36.238
<i>What's the playbook, Jakey?</i>

10:36.239 --> 10:39.775
Well, he left me that note in
the bar to try and scare me.

10:39.776 --> 10:41.777
But it only made me angry.

10:41.778 --> 10:45.114
We go in hard and tough
and take what's rightfully ours.

10:45.148 --> 10:46.982
I want $300.
Absolutely, no problem.

10:47.017 --> 10:48.283
Whatever you need.

10:48.284 --> 10:50.152
I happen to not have
any money on me though.

10:50.153 --> 10:51.353
Charles, do you have any cash?

10:51.388 --> 10:55.624
Um, I have $120,
and my lucky $2 bill

10:55.625 --> 10:57.359
that I found on
my first day of kindergarten.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.395
Okay, so that's $122.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.730
And I want your shoes.
<i>What? Fine.</i>

11:01.765 --> 11:04.133
Here.
Take my shoes.

11:04.134 --> 11:05.567
Can I please have the watch now?

11:05.602 --> 11:08.237
You already have it.
You had it all along.

11:08.238 --> 11:09.371
What?
What are you talking about?

11:09.406 --> 11:10.606
I put it in the glove
compartment of your car.

11:10.607 --> 11:11.840
Think I'm gonna walk around

11:11.841 --> 11:13.042
with a stolen
police captain's watch?

11:13.043 --> 11:14.643
I'm not an idiot.

11:14.678 --> 11:15.878
Great.
Well, I would say thank you,

11:15.879 --> 11:17.212
but even for a criminal
your customer service

11:17.213 --> 11:18.614
has been abysmal.

11:18.648 --> 11:20.115
My pleasure.
Have a good night.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.351
Let's get back to the precinct
and win this bet.

11:22.385 --> 11:23.452
<i>Jake!
Jake, your car!</i>

11:23.486 --> 11:24.653
No!
Ow, glass.

11:24.654 --> 11:25.654
No!

11:25.689 --> 11:27.061
<i>Ugh, syringe.</i>

11:27.090 --> 11:28.424
<i>Jake, you parked
in front of a hydrant.</i>

11:28.425 --> 11:29.658
<i>Stupid fire department.</i>

11:29.693 --> 11:31.527
We gotta think of a way
to catch up with that truck.

11:31.528 --> 11:33.228
Oh!
How 'bout this?

11:33.229 --> 11:35.197
Yes.
Hop in.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.867
Go!

11:38.868 --> 11:40.703
We're doing it, Boyle.

11:40.737 --> 11:42.771
We're Tokyo drifting.

11:44.221 --> 11:46.774
Gah, I can't see
the tow truck anymore.

11:46.775 --> 11:49.277
Charles, how come you're
so much slower than a car?

11:49.278 --> 11:51.612
I'm just trying not
to jostle you too much.

11:51.647 --> 11:53.981
You're the champagne of friends.

11:54.016 --> 11:55.016
Look, there's a bar up ahead.

11:55.017 --> 11:56.117
Maybe we can get a cab up there.

11:56.151 --> 11:57.385
There's still time
to get that watch.

11:57.386 --> 11:58.653
All right.

11:58.687 --> 12:00.121
Excuse me!

12:00.155 --> 12:01.555
<i>Excuse me.</i>

12:01.556 --> 12:02.990
Shoeless cop coming through.

12:04.092 --> 12:06.360
Oh, God!
Charles!

12:06.395 --> 12:07.428
Jake, where are you?

12:07.429 --> 12:09.730
Come on!
Gah!

12:09.731 --> 12:11.065
I was gonna wear this jacket

12:11.066 --> 12:12.934
to my cousin's bat mitzvah
next week.

12:12.935 --> 12:13.968
Hey!
Take it easy!

12:13.969 --> 12:15.937
Get off of me!

12:15.938 --> 12:17.605
<i>Jake, party bus.
Toot! Toot!</i>

12:17.606 --> 12:18.940
<i>Get on board.</i>

12:18.941 --> 12:21.175
Good idea, Boyle.
Ugh, get off.

12:21.176 --> 12:22.710
Ahh!
He's got my hand!

12:22.711 --> 12:24.045
Aghhh!

12:24.046 --> 12:25.279
Move!

12:26.348 --> 12:27.515
NYPD.

12:27.549 --> 12:30.184
I won't stop the party,
but I do need the bus.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.794
Let's dance, rawr.

12:39.828 --> 12:42.263
All right.
What is happening here?

12:42.264 --> 12:45.199
It's Halloween, man!
Lighten up, ha ha!

12:45.200 --> 12:47.535
It's Halloween!

12:47.536 --> 12:49.637
Halloween!

12:49.638 --> 12:52.173
Well, gotta do something
for 16 blocks.

12:52.174 --> 12:53.641
Halloween!
Halloween!

12:53.642 --> 12:56.177
Halloween!

12:57.613 --> 12:59.614
Hey, I've been looking for you.

12:59.615 --> 13:00.648
We need to talk.

13:00.682 --> 13:02.450
Can we not do this
right now, Terry?

13:02.451 --> 13:05.052
I'm in the midst
of a personal tragedy.

13:05.087 --> 13:06.554
Oh, my God.

13:06.588 --> 13:08.389
Is everything okay
with your family?

13:08.423 --> 13:11.125
Family, what?
No, this is serious.

13:11.126 --> 13:14.295
Floorgasm just came by and
danced me out of the group.

13:25.207 --> 13:26.440
It's not fair.

13:26.441 --> 13:28.643
I founded the group,
and now they wanna kick me out

13:28.644 --> 13:31.946
just because I missed
eight rehearsals in a row?

13:31.947 --> 13:35.650
I never thought I'd say this,
but floorgasm has a point.

13:35.651 --> 13:38.019
You're being
super irresponsible.

13:38.053 --> 13:39.387
You have a "baditude."

13:39.388 --> 13:40.855
That's a bad attitude.

13:40.889 --> 13:42.723
I love that.

13:42.724 --> 13:45.092
Look, I didn't want you to know

13:45.093 --> 13:46.894
because it's
so off-brand for me,

13:46.895 --> 13:48.930
but I'm missing rehearsals

13:48.931 --> 13:50.731
because I've been going
to college at night.

13:50.766 --> 13:53.868
I'm trying to finish my
bachelor's degree or whatever.

13:53.869 --> 13:56.270
Really?
That's great, Gina.

13:56.305 --> 13:57.705
I'm so proud of you.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.740
And while I generally
nail everything,

13:59.741 --> 14:02.176
I'm just having trouble
balancing my studies

14:02.211 --> 14:03.644
and my passion for dance.

14:03.679 --> 14:05.513
Plus, you're working full-time.

14:05.547 --> 14:08.149
Yeah, that actually doesn't
factor into it whatsoever.

14:08.150 --> 14:09.717
Anyway, it doesn't matter,

14:09.718 --> 14:11.752
because I'm never
gonna dance again.

14:11.753 --> 14:14.822
The world just lost an angel.

14:14.823 --> 14:16.190
You know what?

14:16.191 --> 14:17.525
I'm gonna dance
with you tonight.

14:17.526 --> 14:20.194
I'm not gonna let
those losers punish you

14:20.195 --> 14:21.762
for doing something good.

14:21.763 --> 14:23.664
School is cool.

14:23.665 --> 14:25.833
That's why it rhymes.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.502
Terry, you are the best!

14:27.503 --> 14:30.138
World, your angel has returned.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.374
Oh, God.

14:35.344 --> 14:36.644
Thanks for the ride.

14:36.678 --> 14:39.147
Tag me in those pics.

14:39.148 --> 14:41.582
Ah, hi there.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.984
I'm Jake Peralta, NYPD.

14:42.985 --> 14:45.086
You guys towed my car,
and I really need it back.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.921
Mm-hmm.

14:46.922 --> 14:48.256
Got a badge?

14:48.257 --> 14:50.057
Yeah, I sure do.

14:50.058 --> 14:51.993
What?

14:51.994 --> 14:53.427
D'oh, my badge!

14:53.428 --> 14:56.230
Those demons on the party bus
must have stolen it.

14:56.231 --> 14:57.632
If you got a license
and credit card,

14:57.633 --> 14:58.966
just pay to get it out.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.034
Oh, great.
Thank you.

15:00.035 --> 15:01.135
Finally, something goes right.

15:01.136 --> 15:02.703
It's gone horribly wrong!

15:02.704 --> 15:05.139
I don't have my I.D.
or my credit cards,

15:05.140 --> 15:07.008
but I really need that car.

15:07.009 --> 15:08.543
Please, I'm begging you.

15:08.577 --> 15:11.546
Rules are rules.
I can't do nothing for you.

15:11.547 --> 15:12.613
Don't shut it.

15:12.648 --> 15:14.882
Don't shut the window.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.651
You got it.

15:16.685 --> 15:18.352
Just gonna give up on this
and head straight home

15:18.353 --> 15:20.121
without trying anything else.

15:29.131 --> 15:30.798
Oh, look at the view
from up here.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.667
I didn't know
we lived near water.

15:33.669 --> 15:35.603
Ouch.

15:35.604 --> 15:37.071
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

15:39.174 --> 15:40.308
Perfect.

15:42.244 --> 15:43.444
Ah.

15:46.748 --> 15:48.950
I can still win this bet.

15:48.951 --> 15:51.652
I can still win.

15:51.653 --> 15:53.488
No!

15:53.522 --> 15:54.822
No!

15:54.823 --> 15:56.924
Noooo!

15:56.925 --> 15:58.226
<i>Freeze!
Don't move!</i>

15:59.261 --> 16:01.095
Oh, my God.

16:01.130 --> 16:04.198
There is a tiny chance
I may not win this bet.

16:06.774 --> 16:09.109
Talk now!

16:09.110 --> 16:10.543
You seem upset.

16:10.544 --> 16:12.779
Well, here's how the story goes.

16:12.780 --> 16:15.382
Remember that little
Halloween bet that we made?

16:15.383 --> 16:16.583
You probably
don't even remember,

16:16.584 --> 16:17.784
it was so early this morning.

16:17.785 --> 16:20.820
Anywhoozle, it turns out
the criminal I hired

16:20.821 --> 16:22.622
to lift your watch
was not trustworthy,

16:22.623 --> 16:25.292
and I ended up contracting
tuberculosis of the foot

16:25.293 --> 16:27.894
and subsequently
sing your death watch.

16:27.928 --> 16:30.397
But in the end, I like
to think this whole thing

16:30.398 --> 16:31.965
is gonna bring us
closer together.

16:31.966 --> 16:33.867
And isn't that what
it's really all about?

16:33.868 --> 16:36.336
Merry Christmas!

16:36.337 --> 16:37.470
What are you saying?

16:37.505 --> 16:39.105
My watch is right here.

16:39.140 --> 16:41.241
No, I made a switch.
That's a fake.

16:41.275 --> 16:42.976
No.

16:42.977 --> 16:44.711
This one's a fake.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.012
What?

16:46.013 --> 16:47.280
No.

16:47.281 --> 16:48.481
What?

16:48.482 --> 16:49.549
No.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.051
What?

16:52.586 --> 16:53.653
No.

16:53.654 --> 16:55.422
You were behind all this?

16:55.456 --> 16:58.358
You played me.

16:58.359 --> 17:01.494
Like Frans Bruggen
plays the flute.

17:01.495 --> 17:02.696
But how?

17:02.697 --> 17:04.396
I've been planning this this theft
for three months.

17:04.397 --> 17:09.135
I know, but I've been
planning it for a year.

17:09.136 --> 17:11.304
Last Halloween,
after you won the bet,

17:11.305 --> 17:13.740
I went back to my office
to do everyone's paperwork,

17:13.741 --> 17:15.474
but I did no paperwork.

17:15.509 --> 17:17.477
I started to plot my revenge.

17:17.511 --> 17:21.080
I began by creating
a word cloud.

17:21.115 --> 17:22.582
But how could you
possibly have known

17:22.583 --> 17:24.284
I was gonna try
and steal your watch?

17:24.318 --> 17:26.519
I knew you would try to take
something important to me.

17:26.520 --> 17:31.224
During the year, I drew
your attention to my watch.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.927
You're eight minutes late.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.862
You're 14 minutes late.

17:35.863 --> 17:40.467
You're three minutes early...
In Chicago.

17:40.468 --> 17:42.235
You annoyed me into stealing it.

17:42.236 --> 17:43.270
Exactly.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.772
Now you had a target,
but you needed a plan.

17:45.806 --> 17:47.440
Fortunately,
it walked through the door,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.309
handcuffed to Diaz.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.878
This scumbag pickpocket
is Dan McCreary.

17:51.879 --> 17:54.214
He can take anything
off of anyone.

17:54.248 --> 17:56.082
Anything?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.717
Anyone?

17:57.718 --> 18:00.120
The look on your face,
priceless.

18:00.154 --> 18:02.856
I put McCreary
into my employ immediately.

18:02.857 --> 18:04.591
Fast-forward to this morning.

18:04.592 --> 18:06.226
You commenced your plan.

18:06.260 --> 18:07.894
McCreary stole my watch,

18:07.895 --> 18:09.062
and then replaced it
with the replica.

18:09.063 --> 18:10.397
And while you celebrated,

18:10.398 --> 18:13.633
McCreary put my watch
back in my pocket.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.869
The watch never left my person.

18:15.870 --> 18:20.273
Dun-dun-duh!

18:20.274 --> 18:22.475
I can see that
you're enjoying this.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.444
Not nearly as much
as I enjoyed phase two.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.478
Phase two.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.147
While you met with McCreary,

18:27.148 --> 18:30.250
Santiago placed a fire
hydrant in front of your car,

18:30.251 --> 18:32.652
which she then towed away.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.522
Next, I had to take Charles
out of the equation.

18:35.556 --> 18:36.756
He had a badge and a gun,

18:36.757 --> 18:38.591
and he would do anything
to help you.

18:38.592 --> 18:42.228
Enter a parade of drunks
that separated the two of you

18:42.263 --> 18:45.398
long enough for Terry
to kidnap Charles.

18:45.399 --> 18:47.567
Then two bears
spilled their drinks on you

18:47.568 --> 18:49.002
and stole your wallet.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.739
Those bears?
Scully and Hitchcock.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.342
I can't pull my head off!

18:55.343 --> 18:56.743
If Terry kidnapped Charles,

18:56.744 --> 18:58.478
how did Charles tell me
to get on the party bus?

18:58.479 --> 19:00.680
Eight months ago
at a morning briefing,

19:00.681 --> 19:03.416
I told the squad
that a group of thieves

19:03.417 --> 19:05.252
was targeting party busses,

19:05.253 --> 19:07.754
so I could record
Charles saying...

19:07.755 --> 19:10.090
Jake, party bus!
Toot toot!

19:10.091 --> 19:11.191
Get on board!

19:13.728 --> 19:15.862
I knew Boyle would never
knowingly betray me.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.164
With your jacket and shoes gone,
you didn't look like a cop,

19:18.165 --> 19:19.399
but you still had your badge.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.769
That is, until you entered
the party bus.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.572
Rosa's feline dancing
distracted you

19:25.573 --> 19:28.542
as a mysterious partier
stole your badge on...

19:28.576 --> 19:30.844
Halloween!

19:30.845 --> 19:32.345
It was you in the mask!

19:32.346 --> 19:34.047
You sly son of a bitch!

19:34.048 --> 19:35.215
Well done.

19:35.249 --> 19:38.251
<i>But I do have to ask,</i> those
guys at the impound,

19:38.252 --> 19:40.186
did they really smash my car?

19:40.187 --> 19:41.388
No, in fact, I had them wash it.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.189
Good one, captain.

19:43.190 --> 19:44.925
You can't "wash a car."

19:44.959 --> 19:47.327
So how'd you convince
the whole squad to betray me?

19:47.328 --> 19:48.895
What'd you offer them?

19:48.930 --> 19:50.263
I asked them if they wanted
to embarrass you,

19:50.264 --> 19:51.431
and they instantly said yes.

19:51.465 --> 19:53.533
I'm not gonna lie,
that turns me on a little bit.

19:53.534 --> 19:54.868
Hmm.

19:54.869 --> 19:58.838
So in addition to the five
weeks of free overtime,

19:58.839 --> 20:00.807
I believe I'm owed
one more thing.

20:00.841 --> 20:02.542
Yes.
Here we go.

20:02.543 --> 20:04.778
One second.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.382
Very well.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.218
Captain Raymond Holt...
Mm-hmm.

20:11.219 --> 20:16.890
You are an amazing
police captain/genius.

20:18.526 --> 20:19.860
But be warned,

20:19.861 --> 20:22.929
I started planning next year's
heist just this minute.

20:22.964 --> 20:25.932
Good, then you're only
three months behind.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.301
You sick son of a bitch.

20:39.413 --> 20:41.815
Hey.
Don't look so sad.

20:41.816 --> 20:45.018
Floorgasm is just a rudderless
dance ship without you.

20:45.052 --> 20:46.620
I would have gone
with "flock of dum-dums."

20:46.654 --> 20:47.954
<i>I talked to the captain.</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:48.955
<i>We're all gonna pitch in</i>

20:48.990 --> 20:50.257
and help you manage your time

20:50.258 --> 20:52.826
so you can pursue
dance and school.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.362
And I'd like to volunteer
my time to tutor you for free.

20:55.363 --> 20:56.530
Mm, a hard pass on that.

20:56.531 --> 20:57.697
But I do wanna thank you guys

20:57.698 --> 21:00.100
for being so understanding
and nice.

21:00.101 --> 21:02.135
Now get your game face on.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.771
Sarge, it's time to dance!

21:04.772 --> 21:06.973
If you forget your moves,
just rip your cape off

21:06.974 --> 21:08.909
and throw me up in the air
like a pizza.

21:08.910 --> 21:10.343
<i>Put your hands together</i>

21:10.344 --> 21:14.681
<i>for the dance duo,
Mr. and Mrs. Terry Jeffords.</i>

21:14.682 --> 21:17.317
I did not agree to that name!
