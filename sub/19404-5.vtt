KNIGHTLY TRADING CARDS?

17:40.058 --> 17:41.477
AHA.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.646
THE ONLY FOOD IMPKINS
EAT IS PLUMBERRIES.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.649
THAT'S WHY THEY LIKE
THE PLUMBERRY ICE CREAM,

17:47.733 --> 17:49.943
BECAUSE OF
THE PLUMBERRIES...

17:50.027 --> 17:50.986

WHERE THEY LIVE,

18:04.792 --> 18:07.753
AND I KNOW HOW, BUT
WE ARE GONNA NEED

18:07.836 --> 18:11.590

WE STILL HAVEN'T TRIED IT,
BUT IT'S STILL REALLY GOOD.

19:17.739 --> 19:21.368
PLUMBERRY NICE.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.078

[TRINKET GASPS]

19:50.480 --> 19:51.231
{\an1}OH, NO!

19:51.315 --> 19:53.984
THERE ARE NO
PLUMBERRIES LEFT.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.903
ALL THE IMPKINS'
FOOD, IT'S GONE.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.655

19:58.739 --> 19:59.781
WE'RE SORRY, NELLA.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.410
WE MUST HAVE PICKED THEM
ALL FOR THE ICE CREAM.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.246

20:25.223 --> 20:28.644
IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT
IN THE TUB, TRINK?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.063
{\an1}THERE'S NO
ICE CREAM LEFT,

20:31.146 --> 20:33.315
BUT THERE'S PLENTY
OF PLUMBERRY SEEDS.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.484
