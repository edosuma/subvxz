00:13.940 --> 00:16.000
-What the fuck is
high fem anyway?

00:16.000 --> 00:16.910
Is this high fem?

00:16.910 --> 00:17.640
Lace?

00:17.640 --> 00:19.010
-No, that's like what
you're wearing when

00:19.010 --> 00:20.690
they find your body
in a motel room.

00:20.690 --> 00:22.480
That's not that.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.020
You know, just a
little word of advice,

00:25.020 --> 00:26.620
it kind of creeps
guys out when you

00:26.620 --> 00:28.090
bring luggage over
on the first date.

00:28.090 --> 00:29.350
-It's not luggage, it's a bag.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.350
It's just an extra bag.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.420
I don't know what
we're going to do.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.240
Is this high fem?

00:33.240 --> 00:33.940
Is this good?

00:33.940 --> 00:35.200
-No, that's Holly Hobby.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.570
ALI: I don't get it,
the high fem thing.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.270
SYD: OK.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.450
I'm low fem.

00:38.450 --> 00:39.470
Me, low fem.

00:39.470 --> 00:40.170
Right?

00:40.170 --> 00:41.160
-OK, so what am I?

00:41.160 --> 00:42.390
-You're like Middle Earth fem.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.660
-Like The Hobbit?

00:43.660 --> 00:45.360
-No, like people that
live under the subway.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.950
Like mole people fem.

00:46.950 --> 00:47.650
-OK, like that?

00:47.650 --> 00:48.950
-Mm-hmm.

00:48.950 --> 00:49.920
-OK, I won't hurt you.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.820
-That's good.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.590
Whoa.

00:54.590 --> 00:55.860
-Whoa.

00:55.860 --> 00:56.880
That is boobage.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.580
-Right?

00:57.580 --> 00:59.530
-Yeah, like spilling out.

00:59.530 --> 01:00.570
You have total cleavage.

01:00.570 --> 01:02.240
-I totally do.

01:02.240 --> 01:02.940
-OK.

01:02.940 --> 01:05.190
Yeehaw.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.280
-I like it.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.260
-I like it.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.150
All right, suck it in.

01:09.150 --> 01:10.200
You look hot as shit, Al.

01:13.610 --> 01:15.010
YOUNG ALI: Look at this.

01:15.010 --> 01:16.590
It's torture.

01:16.590 --> 01:18.850
It-- it's torture in a dress.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.240
Like I just want
to-- I-- like-- just

01:21.240 --> 01:22.770
bring me out there in a noose.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.050
I'm not doing my bat mitzvah.

01:24.050 --> 01:24.980
-What are you talking about?

01:24.980 --> 01:26.280
That-- that's a beautiful dress.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.210
YOUNG ALI: It's a terrible--

01:27.210 --> 01:28.960
-I disagree with you.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.300
-Honest, you actually
believe in God?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.610
-That has nothing to do
with your bat mitzvah.

01:34.610 --> 01:41.650
But, um-- you know I sometimes
have conflict, you know,

01:41.650 --> 01:44.970
and sometimes there's-- I
wonder if there's a-- you know,

01:44.970 --> 01:51.210
with the pain and the suffering
and-- I struggle with it.

01:57.010 --> 01:58.830
YOUNG ALI: So if
there is no God,

01:58.830 --> 02:00.980
I mean, honestly,
like everything

02:00.980 --> 02:04.080
we do-- no one sees it?

02:08.890 --> 02:10.340
MAURA: I say cancel the fucker.

02:10.340 --> 02:13.930
SHELLY: Do you have any idea how
much money we're going to lose?

02:13.930 --> 02:15.220
-I don't give a
shit about money.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.020
I care about what's right.

02:17.020 --> 02:17.850
SHELLY: It's a week away.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.450
What am I supposed to do?

02:19.450 --> 02:22.190
I lost the deposits
already, all of them.

02:22.190 --> 02:24.360
Maybe if our little
heathen in there

02:24.360 --> 02:28.520
had had a revelation
a few months ago--

02:28.520 --> 02:31.100
-Shelly, it's going to be less
money if we just cancel it now.

02:31.100 --> 02:31.930
Please?

02:31.930 --> 02:32.930
SHELLY: You know what?

02:32.930 --> 02:36.670
I already paid $3,000 for the
invitations, the postage alone.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.060
What am I supposed to do here?

02:38.060 --> 02:39.610
-You're not supposed
to do anything, Shell.

02:39.610 --> 02:40.830
It's not your bat mitzvah.

02:40.830 --> 02:43.050
SHELLY: It most certainly is.

02:43.050 --> 02:44.520
MAURA: What do
you want me to do?

02:44.520 --> 02:48.740
-I want you to be a man
and save the goddamn day.

03:37.540 --> 03:38.990
-Bueno.

03:38.990 --> 03:40.950
Bueno, me gusto.

03:40.950 --> 03:46.110
Quero que ustedes poner
esos en el truck, por favor.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.640
-Hey, babe.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.340
TAMMY: Hey!

03:48.340 --> 03:49.260
-Oh my God.

03:49.260 --> 03:50.210
TAMMY: I know, right?

03:50.210 --> 03:50.910
-Wow.

03:50.910 --> 03:52.500
TAMMY: Wow.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.410
-Oh, my God, the
pony wall's gone.

03:54.410 --> 03:55.110
TAMMY: Pony?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.360
What the hell's a pony wall?

03:56.360 --> 03:58.290
-My mum called it-- isn't
that called a pony wall,

03:58.290 --> 03:58.530
that wall-to-wall?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.200
TAMMY: I don't know but
it is now going to be

04:00.200 --> 04:02.630
called the
open-the-fuck-up railing.

04:02.630 --> 04:03.330
Awesome!

04:03.330 --> 04:04.580
-It opens it.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.540
TAMMY (SINGSONG):
Celebration weekend.

04:06.540 --> 04:07.240
What?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.380
-Yeah.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.100
Oh, right, the kids.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.380
-Magic fucking
miracle we're finally

04:10.380 --> 04:11.680
getting our custody
schedules aligned.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.380
No kids.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.160
-Yep, sounds great.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.920
We also need to go
to a talent show.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.960
Oh my God!

04:15.960 --> 04:16.660
-What?

04:16.660 --> 04:18.390
-Joshy's Michael Jackson glove.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.090
-Really?

04:19.090 --> 04:21.110
SARAH: Holy-- we
looked for this.

04:21.110 --> 04:21.940
He cried.

04:21.940 --> 04:22.640
-Uh-huh.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.010
-He used to do these
moon walk shows for me

04:25.010 --> 04:26.260
right before bedtime.

04:26.260 --> 04:30.450
[GASPS] His pirate treasure
box, this thing is cool.

04:30.450 --> 04:31.210
Did you see this?

04:31.210 --> 04:31.780
TAMMY: Mmm.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.010
-You weren't going
to throw this out.

04:33.010 --> 04:34.070
Babe, check with me.
TAMMY: Mmm.

04:34.070 --> 04:34.980
-See how it folds?

04:34.980 --> 04:36.470
I love this thing.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.670
-You look good.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.370
-Thanks.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.330
-Wow, this is far.

05:12.330 --> 05:13.810
-Almost there, little lady.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.060
DALE: We're home.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.960
ALI: Wow, you're
house is awesome.

05:31.960 --> 05:32.660
DALE: Thanks.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.360
-Nobody said you could sit down.

06:33.490 --> 06:34.820
SARAH: Do you think
it's like suspicious

06:34.820 --> 06:37.820
if I check off too many things?

06:37.820 --> 06:39.590
-No, Dr. Steve
doesn't give a fuck.

06:39.590 --> 06:40.320
He's my homeboy.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.170
-I mean, I just want to
justify, you know what I mean?

06:42.170 --> 06:42.870
DR. STEVE: Hello.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.990
JOSH: Hey, buddy.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.690
-Look at this.

06:44.690 --> 06:45.530
-Good to see you.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.310
-How are you, handsome?

06:46.310 --> 06:47.300
-Yeah, looking good.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.000
You loo-- hello?

06:48.000 --> 06:48.730
SARAH: Hi.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.140
-You're a beautiful lady.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.090
-Thank you.

06:51.090 --> 06:51.790
-Sarah.

06:51.790 --> 06:52.720
DR. STEVE: Hey.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.310
I called you guys for the hookup
for those Widespread Panic

06:56.310 --> 06:57.550
tickets and they
said it was a no-go.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.250
What's up?

06:58.250 --> 06:59.350
-I know, bro, I'm sorry.

06:59.350 --> 07:01.020
Can't help you in that
department right now.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.890
I'm just, uh-- Some
shit went down at work.

07:03.890 --> 07:04.730
-Uh-oh.

07:04.730 --> 07:05.510
-Kinda got fired.

07:05.510 --> 07:08.500
-But when I get my new label
going, it's going to be major.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.000
-Oh, let's see what we got here.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.690
Let's get down to brass tacks.

07:12.690 --> 07:14.520
Now what do you think is the
worst out of these things,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.420
cause you checked
a bunch-- anxiety,

07:16.420 --> 07:18.420
irritable bowel
syndrome, really?

07:18.420 --> 07:21.280
For such a pretty lady,
such an upset tummy.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.920
-It's sort of hard to
say, like this weekend

07:22.920 --> 07:24.850
I don't have my kids for
the first time like ever

07:24.850 --> 07:27.230
in their whole lives because
I have this recent separation

07:27.230 --> 07:29.780
and it was kind of-- but
it's like-- I-- but I--

07:29.780 --> 07:31.630
I don't really-- I mean
I don't really feel that.

07:31.630 --> 07:33.470
But I don't know like I guess
I'm like really revved up

07:33.470 --> 07:35.240
during the day and then when
I try to sleep at night,

07:35.240 --> 07:36.050
I can't get to sleep.

07:36.050 --> 07:38.250
But-- and being so funny like
I am the happiest I have ever

07:38.250 --> 07:41.450
been in my life, so this like
totally doesn't make sense.

07:41.450 --> 07:42.830
DR. STEVE: You
seem very anxious.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.530
SARAH: I do?

07:43.530 --> 07:44.230
-Yeah.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.160
I mean sexy, but anxious.

07:45.160 --> 07:45.860
SARAH: Oh, thank you.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.310
How-- how soon do I get the pot?

07:47.310 --> 07:48.840
-Oh, no, it's not pot.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.660
We call it medicine.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.800
-Fucking talent show?

07:54.800 --> 07:55.560
What?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.830
And the dude had no
talent whatsoever.

07:57.830 --> 08:01.240
W-- What-- What talent did he
acquire now that he's a chick?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.840
And why did you tell him
without talking to me?

08:03.840 --> 08:06.360
-How many fucking Little League
games has he gone to for you?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.220
How many hours has he
wasted of his life.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.260
You can give him one.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.030
-That's his job as a father.

08:11.030 --> 08:12.170
That's what he's supposed to do.

08:12.170 --> 08:12.870
-Oh my god.

08:12.870 --> 08:16.190
I forgot how much I love this.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.260
This is-- This is legal.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.660
I have a bag.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.090
-This is way stronger than
what you remember from college.

08:22.090 --> 08:23.840
You have no idea what's
in store for you.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.000
-It's called a--
What is this one?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.470
It's like Jedi Kush.

08:27.470 --> 08:28.880
We didn't have fucking names.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.660
Pink Revisions?

08:29.660 --> 08:31.210
What the fuck is that?

08:31.210 --> 08:31.910
Oh my god.

08:31.910 --> 08:32.610
I'm sorry.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.650
I'm bogarting this whole thing.

08:33.650 --> 08:34.350
Do you want some?

08:34.350 --> 08:36.990
-I'm-- I'm not--

08:36.990 --> 08:38.350
-You don't want any?

08:38.350 --> 08:40.910
-I'm trying not to pile fucked
up on top of freaked out.

08:40.910 --> 08:44.630
-You're not OK with
all this shit with dad?

08:44.630 --> 08:45.460
-I don't know what I am.

08:48.850 --> 08:51.960
-I didn't know whether you were
a leg man or a boob man, so I--

08:51.960 --> 08:54.300
-Don't talk.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.230
Just let me look at you.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.100
-What do you want me to do?

09:00.100 --> 09:02.030
-When you talk to me going,
I want you to say daddy

09:02.030 --> 09:05.420
at the end of it,
every fucking time.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.280
-What do you want
me to do, daddy?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.650
-Hike up that skirt.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.490
Let me see those panties.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.030
Pull them down to your knees.

09:19.030 --> 09:20.600
-Daddy, normally I
would object to the use

09:20.600 --> 09:21.490
of the word panties--

09:21.490 --> 09:22.750
-Shut the fuck up.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.930
You talk too much.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.630
What the fuck is all that?

09:29.630 --> 09:33.420
-Big girls have bush, daddy.

09:33.420 --> 09:35.230
-Not all of them do.

09:35.230 --> 09:36.420
We're gonna fucking fix that.

09:41.010 --> 09:46.110
-When you came in, I kinda
thought you were gonna have,

09:46.110 --> 09:52.040
you know, like a--
Is that ridiculous?

09:52.040 --> 09:53.250
-It's not stapled.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.150
I don't staple it on my head.

09:55.150 --> 09:56.770
I didn't wanna throw
you off with too

09:56.770 --> 09:58.700
much Jewiness on a first date.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.010
-I just wanna sneak a peak.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.670
Just like a little bit.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.000
Can I?

10:05.000 --> 10:05.750
Oh my god.

10:05.750 --> 10:06.780
Look at this.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.480
OK.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.180
