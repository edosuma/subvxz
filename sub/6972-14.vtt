00:49.600 --> 00:53.300
- You in charge here?
- Lieutenant Kraskow. Is the Bureau taking over?

00:53.300 --> 00:56.300
You're welcome to any help that I can give you,
but that's not why I'm here. What can you tell me?

00:56.300 --> 01:01.100
Silent alarm tripped 30 minutes ago. We think
there's one robber, armed. Probably a handgun.

01:01.100 --> 01:06.000
Definitely no pro or he would have been long gone.
A single gunshot about 20 minutes ago.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.700
Blinds are down but we think
we've got a body on the floor.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.000
- But you're not here to take over?
- Two of my agents might be in there.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.100
Skinner! Skinner!

01:16.100 --> 01:17.800
Hold it right here.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.300
- Do I know you?
- Stop this. Don't let this happen!

02:10.600 --> 02:14.600
You're in charge here, you know.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.600
It doesn't have to end like this.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.700
Yeah, it does.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.000
Son of a... Damn it!

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
Yes... Yes.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.300
Monday, 7:16 AM.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
Hello?

05:06.700 --> 05:10.000
It's coming through down there?...

05:11.600 --> 05:16.300
It's my damn waterbed.
My damn waterbed sprung a leak.

05:16.300 --> 05:22.800
I-I-I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed...
I don't know what to tell you... I-I think it was a gift...

05:25.400 --> 05:27.000
All right.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.300
- I know. I missed the meeting.
- You didn't miss the meeting.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.500
You're extraordinarily late for the
meeting. It's still going on.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.800
- What are you doing down here?
- We took a short break and I came looking for you.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.000
- What are you doing down here, Mulder?
- I'm having the best damn day of my life.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.400
Any moment I'm about to burst
into song -- "Zip a dee doo dah."

06:24.400 --> 06:27.800
My, uh, waterbed sprung a leak and
shorted out my alarm clock.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.300
My cell phone got wet and crapped out on me...

06:30.300 --> 06:36.900
...and the check I wrote my landlord to cover the, uh,
damages is going to bounce if I don't deposit my pay.

06:36.900 --> 06:40.900
- You ever have one of those days, Scully?
- Since I've been working here? Yeah.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.500
When did you get a waterbed, Mulder?

06:48.600 --> 06:53.000
Bank's just down the street.
I'll be back in ten. Cover for me, will you?

06:53.300 --> 06:55.500
When do I not?

07:08.700 --> 07:12.100
- Jerk!
- Yeah? You want some?

07:15.500 --> 07:18.600
We good?

07:19.700 --> 07:23.500
- Pam?
- Go run your errand already.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.900
Yeah. I just got to go
pick something up. No biggie.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.800
Right, Bernard. No biggie.

07:33.300 --> 07:37.000
I'll be ten minutes.
Wait here for me.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.000
- Hey, man, you need to watch it next time!
- You watch it!

07:50.700 --> 07:54.000
Right on schedule.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.800
Poor guy.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.200
You never did that before.

08:38.600 --> 08:44.900
"This is a robbery"

08:49.300 --> 08:55.100
Now, that's assuming these trends
continue well into the coming year.

08:55.100 --> 09:00.800
Um, other D.O.J. projections...

09:00.800 --> 09:06.600
...estimate a larger, uh, two to three
percent drop in the overall homicide rate...

09:06.600 --> 09:13.300
...versus the, uh, one to one and a half
percent cited in the earlier, uh, Tanner study.

09:13.300 --> 09:20.100
However, there is some dispute that the, uh,
statistical methodology in this latter study...

09:20.100 --> 09:27.300
...is not the D.O.J. preferred methodology.
In any case added variables make crime trends...

09:27.300 --> 09:32.700
...for the coming year particularly hard to predict.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.700
The unpredictable future.
Which brings us to Agent Mulder.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.900
Will he or will he not grace us with his report?

09:50.300 --> 09:53.300
May I help the next in line, please?

09:57.200 --> 10:00.200
I've got... a few transactions.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
"This is a robbery. Put the
money in the bag. No alarms."

10:25.100 --> 10:28.300
Customers, face down!
You know what this is!

10:28.300 --> 10:31.300
- Oh, God.
- You! On the floor!

10:31.300 --> 10:34.300
- Oh, God, don't shoot us!
- Shut up!

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
You're the boss.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.100
It's all right.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.600
All right, I'm the boss!
No silent alarms, no dye packs.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.900
Do it like the insurance company taught you.
Start with the counter money.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.700
Quicker you go, quicker I go.
Everybody else out here on the floor.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.300
Ahh! Leave the last one. No tricks.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
All right, come on. Come on, come on, come on!

11:09.100 --> 11:12.100
Zip a dee doo dah.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.500
All right, get your keys. Come around here.
We're going to open up the ATM.

11:33.900 --> 11:38.700
Hey, lock the doors!
You forgot to lock the front door.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.900
On the ground!

11:48.300 --> 11:52.700
- Drop it! Drop it now!
- You drop it!

11:58.100 --> 12:01.300
You drop it.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.800
Travel expense reimbursement.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.800
Who's got those figures? All I've got here
is third and fourth quarter. No?

12:18.800 --> 12:21.600
Assistant Director?

12:33.100 --> 12:34.300
Go, go, go.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.200
Go, go, go!

12:52.400 --> 12:53.900
Sir.

13:03.100 --> 13:07.500
- Who's in charge here?
- I am. Unless the Bureau's taking over.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.100
- Skinner!
- Hey, hold it!

13:09.100 --> 13:14.000
Skinner! Don't let them charge in there.
Skinner!

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Do I know you?

13:16.300 --> 13:18.400
Skinner!

13:39.200 --> 13:42.800
They're supposed to call, right?

13:42.800 --> 13:45.700
They're not going to call.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.200
- What's your name?
- Yeah.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.000
Look, I got to call you something, right?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
How about Steve?

13:59.000 --> 14:04.500
It's a nice... honest name.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.000
Steve.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.700
Bernard.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.400
I have to get my partner out of here.

14:17.400 --> 14:22.100
I am blowing this whole freaking place
right off the map if they come in here.

14:22.100 --> 14:28.100
Look, they don't know that.
Don't you realize that? They can't see you.

14:28.100 --> 14:33.200
- They don't know what your plan is.
- They better know. They damn well better figure it out.

14:33.200 --> 14:39.400
Look... just walk in front
of the door and show them.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.700
You want to get me killed!

14:51.400 --> 14:56.800
I just want everybody to live. That's all.

14:56.800 --> 15:03.400
I just... just show them.

15:04.900 --> 15:10.600
You have control over
everything that happens here.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.100
You do.

15:14.300 --> 15:18.000
And it doesn't have to end this way.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
Yeah, it does.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.700
Oh, son of a...

16:36.800 --> 16:39.200
Son of a bitch.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.900
Monday, 7:14 AM.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.200
Oh... that's great.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.400
Yeah?...

17:02.400 --> 17:05.200
It's coming through down there?...

17:06.900 --> 17:10.000
It's my damn waterbed.
It sprung a leak.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.200
Yeah, I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed.
I don't know what to tell you. I... I...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.800
I'm sorry. I mean, I...

18:00.900 --> 18:03.100
Who you calling?

18:03.100 --> 18:05.400
Nobody.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.700
What do you mean, nobody?
It's got to be somebody.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.900
It's nobody you know, Bernard. Forget it.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.000
There's something I got to do.
I want you to come.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.700
I'm not going with you.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.800
Look, I'm not asking.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.600
Pam?

18:26.400 --> 18:29.900
Don't go getting all weird on me.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.400
It'll only take a couple of minutes.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.000
Look, Bernard... just go to work.
It's not too late.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.900
I'm not going to work today.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.300
- And don't say they're going to fire me.
- I wasn't going to say that.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.800
'Cause you know what? Who cares?

18:46.800 --> 18:50.200
Like there's a big future in mopping floors.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.900
Like that's something to lose.

18:52.900 --> 18:58.400
- We lose everything.
- No, no. I got a plan.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.800
This time tomorrow, Pam...

19:01.800 --> 19:05.500
Everything will be roses.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.300
Damn it.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.100
I know. I missed the meeting.

19:41.100 --> 19:45.200
Well, not yet, but, uh, only because
it's the longest in FBI history.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.100
- What are you doing down here, then?
- Well, I came looking for you.

19:48.100 --> 19:53.800
We took a five-minute break three minutes ago.
Mulder, your cell phone's not working.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.000
- Did you oversleep?
- Scully, did you ever have one of those days...

19:56.000 --> 19:59.100
...you wish you could rewind and start
all over again from the beginning?

19:59.100 --> 20:01.200
Yes. Frequently.

20:01.200 --> 20:07.300
But, I mean, who's... who's to say that if you
did rewind it and start over again that it
wouldn't end up exactly the same way?

20:07.300 --> 20:09.800
So you think it's all just fate?
We have no free will?

20:09.800 --> 20:14.500
No, I think that we're free to be the
people that we are -- good, bad or indifferent.

20:14.500 --> 20:19.400
- I think that it's our character that determines our fate.
- And all the rest is just preordained? I don't buy that.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.500
There's too many variables.
Too many forks in the road.

20:21.500 --> 20:26.100
I meant to be on time to work this morning but my
waterbed springs a leak flooding my apartment...

20:26.100 --> 20:29.100
...and the apartment below me so that
makes me late for the meeting.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.300
And then I realize I got to write a check to
cover the damages to my landlord but, ...

20:32.300 --> 20:36.000
...as I'm walking to work, I realize that
that's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.400
So now I got to go to the bank,
which makes me even later.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.500
Since when did you get a waterbed?

20:42.500 --> 20:46.100
I might just as easily not have a waterbed
then I'd be on time for this meeting.

20:46.100 --> 20:53.600
You might just as easily have stayed in medicine and
not gone into the FBI, and then we would never have met.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.500
- Fate.
- Free will. With every choice, you change your fate.

20:56.500 --> 21:00.600
Then let's change yours.
I will deposit your check.

21:00.600 --> 21:07.600
You gather your files, go to Skinner's office, give
your report before he takes it out on both of us.

21:24.900 --> 21:28.500
"This is a holdup..."

21:44.900 --> 21:49.100
I endorsed my damn check stub.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.300
Mulder!

22:05.900 --> 22:08.700
Don't go in the bank today.

22:08.700 --> 22:13.900
- Excuse me?
- Bernard's in there. Please don't go in the bank.

22:13.900 --> 22:18.700
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?
- You pass me every day on the street. Every single day.

22:18.700 --> 22:22.900
This day, on your way to the bank. And then
you go inside, and everybody gets killed, ...

22:22.900 --> 22:26.800
...you, your partner, Bernard, everybody.

22:26.800 --> 22:31.800
- I pass you... and then we die.
- Yes. Over and over.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.200
Only... only last time you looked at me,
you looked at me like you knew me.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.200
Like you remembered.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.100
Please remember me.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.900
Don't go.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.800
Drop your weapon!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.300
Drop it.

23:07.300 --> 23:11.100
I ain't dropping nothing.
You put yours down.

23:14.500 --> 23:18.800
- I'll shoot her!
- What do you think I'll do then?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.900
Bernard...

23:28.900 --> 23:32.900
That's your name, right?

23:44.400 --> 23:48.100
Bernard, she's not dead.
You're not a murderer yet.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.100
You can end this the right way.

23:51.100 --> 23:56.900
Sir, please. Listen to them.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.600
Don't hurt anybody else.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.300
A whole lot of police are coming.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.400
You tripped the alarm.

25:25.300 --> 25:31.800
Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know.
I-I know already. I'll pay for it.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.800
Monday, 7:15.

26:05.900 --> 26:10.700
The cellular customer you are
trying to reach is not responding...

26:14.600 --> 26:16.300
Agent Scully...

26:16.300 --> 26:17.500
Yes?

26:17.500 --> 26:21.000
- Please don't go inside the bank today.
- The bank?

26:21.000 --> 26:25.600
Cradock Marine, Eighth Street
branch a block from here.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.400
I'm not following. Did-did you
get separated from your tour?

26:28.400 --> 26:33.700
I'm here to see you.
I'm begging you... please don't go this time.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.500
Don't let Mulder go, either.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.700
- Um... I'm sorry...
- Excuse me, miss?

26:39.700 --> 26:42.800
You're not supposed to be in this area.

26:44.500 --> 26:50.300
If you walk in that bank,
you'll die. Both of you.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.600
- Did I miss the meeting?
- Huh?

27:18.600 --> 27:24.200
No. No, we, uh, took a five-minute
break about, uh, three minutes ago.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.400
Uh, Mulder, your cell phone's not working.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.500
- Wow, that is so strange.
- What?

27:33.500 --> 27:37.500
I just got the weirdest sensation of déjà vu.
I've been having it all morning.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.100
- Well, that's fairly common.
- Yeah, but never to this degree.

27:40.100 --> 27:44.400
I mean, I woke up, I opened my eyes,
I was soaking wet...

27:44.400 --> 27:49.800
It's a long story but I had the distinct
sensation that I had lived that moment before.

27:49.800 --> 27:55.300
Well, you may have. Did you
do a lot of drinking in college?

27:55.300 --> 27:58.200
- I wonder what it means.
- Mulder, I don't see why it has to mean anything.

27:58.200 --> 28:03.800
Well, you know, some Freudians believe the déjà vu phenomenon
to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.900
That it represents a desire to, uh,
have a second chance to set things right.

28:08.900 --> 28:11.900
- Set what kind of things right?
- Whatever's wrong.

28:11.900 --> 28:16.100
Mulder, it's more likely that we're
talking about simple neurochemistry...

28:16.100 --> 28:19.600
A glitch in the brain's ability
to process recognition and memory.

28:19.600 --> 28:23.500
- Doesn't mean that the memory's authentic.
- Yeah? Well, but what if it were?

28:23.500 --> 28:27.200
What if you'd lived this moment
before and now you're living it again?

28:27.200 --> 28:31.000
Yeah -- so that I could right
some wrong or change fate.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.300
Well, right now I'd say you're
fated to go to this meeting.

28:34.300 --> 28:38.000
No. Actually, I'm fated to go to the bank.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.100
Mulder... what bank?

28:42.100 --> 28:46.000
- Cradock. Right down the street.
- Eighth Street.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.400
What?

28:51.000 --> 28:56.800
Some... some woman just stopped me
in the hallway not ten minutes ago.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.700
She knew both of our names...

28:58.700 --> 29:04.700
...and she warned against either of us entering
into the Cradock branch on Eighth Street.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.400
She said that we'd die.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.400
What did she look like?

29:11.400 --> 29:17.000
Five-eight, thin, green eyes, dyed hair.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.800
M-maybe you know her.
Maybe... it's just somebody pulling a prank.

29:22.800 --> 29:27.500
I'll use the ATM machine.
I don't want to tempt fate.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.000
All right, our next order of business is federal
crime projections. Who's got those figures?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.500
Uh, right here.

29:40.700 --> 29:45.700
Um, if you all could just bear
with me one second.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.500
Uh, "federal crime projections".

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE

30:30.600 --> 30:33.000
Do you remember me?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.600
You match a description. You're the, uh...

30:35.600 --> 30:39.700
You're the woman that gave a
warning to my partner, aren't you?

30:39.700 --> 30:42.800
Uh... Have we met?

30:42.800 --> 30:48.500
More times than I can count.
Right here on this sidewalk.

30:48.500 --> 30:53.600
Usually, you walk right by. You'll pass a few
minutes earlier, a few minutes later -- little details, ...

30:53.600 --> 30:58.500
...they change.
But it always ends the same.

30:58.500 --> 31:01.500
What always ends the same?

31:01.500 --> 31:04.700
I keep having this conversation.

31:04.700 --> 31:10.700
We go inside the bank... and we all die.
That's what you told my partner.

31:10.700 --> 31:15.400
Is... is something going to happen inside the bank?
Is there going to be a robbery?

31:15.400 --> 31:19.600
Every time I tell you there's going to be a
robbery you run in there to try to stop it...

31:19.600 --> 31:23.600
...and that's when things go bad.

31:25.400 --> 31:31.500
Don't you see?
We're all in Hell.

31:31.500 --> 31:35.000
I'm the only one who knows it.

31:35.100 --> 31:38.700
Something went very wrong on this
day the first time around.

31:38.700 --> 31:45.600
Something got screwed up. Things didn't
end the way they were supposed to.

31:46.100 --> 31:50.000
Now it's like a needle stuck in a groove.

31:50.500 --> 31:56.900
- You're saying this day repeats over and over again.
- Until we get it right.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.500
Till my boyfriend doesn't blow up that bank.

32:01.500 --> 32:06.500
I have tried everything to stop him.
I've hid his keys, I've drugged his coffee...

32:06.500 --> 32:10.500
I even called the police on him myself.

32:11.300 --> 32:14.100
He always gets here.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.400
He's meant to.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.900
It's you.

32:19.900 --> 32:24.300
It's you and your partner every time.

32:24.300 --> 32:28.100
If it wasn't for you, nobody would die.

32:28.100 --> 32:32.600
If what you're saying is true, how come I don't
remember it? How come you're the only one?

32:32.600 --> 32:36.100
- That's got to be 50 times you've asked me that.
- 51. What's the answer?

32:36.100 --> 32:39.000
I don't know.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.300
I just do.

32:43.500 --> 32:49.600
Be glad you don't.
Please... you can stop this.

32:49.600 --> 32:54.900
You're the variable. It has to be you.
I have tried everyone else.

32:54.900 --> 32:59.600
All I'm asking is just walk away.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.700
That's assuming these trends
continue well into the coming year.

33:06.700 --> 33:14.400
Other D.O.J.. projections estimate a larger two to
three percent drop in the overall homicide rate, ...

33:14.400 --> 33:20.700
...uh versus the, uh, one to one and a half
percent cited in the earlier Tanner study.

33:20.700 --> 33:26.100
- However, there is some dispute that...
- Um, excuse me, uh... Agent Arnold.

33:26.100 --> 33:31.400
- Um, where's Scully?
- She just left, Mulder. I assume to look for you.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.600
Uh, excuse me.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.600
Everybody, face down! You know what this is!
Give me the money.

34:00.600 --> 34:04.500
Oh, God!
Oh, God...

34:04.500 --> 34:07.500
You! On the floor!

34:07.700 --> 34:11.500
Oh, God, you're going to shoot us?
Oh, God he's going to...

34:11.500 --> 34:14.600
- Shut up!
- He's going to shoot us! Please don't kill us!

34:14.600 --> 34:19.000
- Please don't do this!
- Shut up! Give me the money!

34:19.000 --> 34:24.100
- Don't shoot us! Don't shoot us!
- Damn it, shut up!

34:26.300 --> 34:28.100
Hey! Hey!

34:28.100 --> 34:32.699
Get your hands up where I can see them!
Do it! Do it now!

34:34.199 --> 34:36.500
Drop your weapon!

34:53.900 --> 35:01.200
He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.
He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.700
Monday, 7:15 AM.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.200
I know, I know.
I missed the meeting.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.200
You didn't miss the meeting.
You're extraordinarily late for the meeting.

35:48.200 --> 35:52.000
The bank's just down the street.
Cover for me, will you?

35:59.600 --> 36:02.900
We good, Pam?

36:03.700 --> 36:09.400
- Pam?!
- I know... you just got to go pick something up. No biggie.

36:09.700 --> 36:14.000
What is with you?
Why are you always in a mood?

36:15.400 --> 36:19.000
'Cause nothing ever changes.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.800
Things are going to change.
You wait and see.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.000
I'll be ten minutes.
Wait here for me.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.600
- Hey, man, you need to watch it next time!
- You watch it!

36:57.600 --> 36:59.400
Do I know you?

36:59.400 --> 37:03.100
- Do you?
- Yeah, you just look really familiar to me.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.300
- Do I?
- Yeah.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.900
No?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.700
Uh, all right.
I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.300
May I help the next in line, please?

37:48.800 --> 37:58.800
...He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.
He's got a bomb.

38:00.400 --> 38:06.000
...estimate a larger two to three percent
drop in the overall homicide rate, uh, ...

38:06.000 --> 38:11.600
...versus the one to one and a half
percent cited in the earlier Tanner study.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.500
However, there's some dispute that the
statistical methodology in this...

38:16.500 --> 38:22.100
...latter study is not the
D.O.J. preferred methodology.

38:22.100 --> 38:28.300
In any case, added variables make
crime trends for the coming year...

38:28.300 --> 38:31.300
Excuse me.
Agent Scully?

38:36.100 --> 38:38.100
Excuse me.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.300
It's Agent Mulder, and he said it's urgent.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.500
- Mulder, where are you?
- I'm at the bank.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.600
Yeah, I know where you are,
but what's taking so long?

38:50.600 --> 38:55.500
Scully, I need you to do
something for me right now.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.800
- Ma'am, will you come with me?
- Why?

39:09.800 --> 39:12.500
- Just come with me, please.
- What's this about?

39:12.500 --> 39:15.500
My partner said you'd know.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.800
"This is a robbery. Put the money in the bag.
No alarm. No tricks."

39:27.500 --> 39:29.800
Take it.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.800
I'm a federal agent.
I don't want us all to die in here.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.400
What are you talking about?

39:36.400 --> 39:43.400
You've got a girlfriend outside
in the car and you've got a bomb.

39:43.700 --> 39:47.300
Something very bad is going
to happen here today...

39:47.300 --> 39:52.200
...and I want you to know that
I'm not going to let it happen.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.100
But if you walk out that door right now?

39:55.100 --> 39:59.300
I'm not going to stop you.
You're in charge here, Bernard.

39:59.300 --> 40:03.700
- You're damn right.
- You could change your fate.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.700
Everybody down! Now!
You know what this is!

40:19.700 --> 40:23.400
- No! Oh, God!
- Get down!

40:23.400 --> 40:26.800
If you don't believe me, ask her.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.800
- Drop it!
- Get away from her, Pam.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.200
- This isn't gonna work. You can't be in here.
- Drop it now!

40:33.200 --> 40:35.100
- You drop it.
- Listen to me, Bernard...

40:35.100 --> 40:38.500
- You get her out of here!
- You get her out of here. You're dooming her by doing this.

40:38.500 --> 40:42.500
You're making her live this day over
and over again, her, you, me, all of us.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.500
What the hell are you talking about?

40:44.500 --> 40:51.100
Every day you die in here and
every day it starts all over again.

40:51.900 --> 40:58.700
- You can't want this for her. It's Hell!
- Hell? I'm doing this for her.

40:58.700 --> 41:02.100
Listen to him, Bernard.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.400
Put your damn gun down!

41:05.900 --> 41:09.200
Put your gun down, Scully. Trust me, it's
the only way to get out of here.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.800
You got to put your gun down and let them out.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.500
He's got a bomb.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.300
Come on, Bernard. Let's go.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.400
- You son of a bitch!
- No!

42:45.300 --> 42:48.300
This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI...

42:54.800 --> 42:58.800
This never happened before.

43:29.800 --> 43:33.700
- Yeah?
- Mulder, it's me.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.700
Tuesday, 7:17.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.600
I'm late again, aren't I, Scully?

43:37.600 --> 43:41.800
No, not yet but Skinner wants to
see us in his office as soon as possible.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.300
He's asking for our report
on the robbery yesterday.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.600
I'll be there in an hour.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.000
- I'd like to hear it, too.
- Well, you were there, Scully.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
That's not what I mean.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.400
You still won't explain
what happened yesterday...

43:55.400 --> 43:59.400
How you knew that Bernard Oates
was strapped with explosives.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.200
Call it a feeling.

44:01.200 --> 44:06.400
And it was also a feeling that he had
an accomplice waiting in the car?

44:06.400 --> 44:10.400
I don't think she was an accomplice.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.900
I think she was just trying to get away.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.800
Are you okay?

44:16.800 --> 44:19.300
I'll be there in an hour.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.500
"Woman Dies in Robbery Attempt"

44:35.000 --> 44:38.700
