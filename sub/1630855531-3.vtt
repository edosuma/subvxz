WEBVTT

00:22.920 --> 00:24.280
Ahh!

00:31.680 --> 00:33.480
Take my advice, you won't look at it.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.000
I've told you.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.080
You make better coffee
when you're happier. The girls notice.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.000
I'm perfectly happy.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.480
That'll be your Lindsay texting again.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.120
I don't believe my relationship
is any concern of yours.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.120
Obviously not.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.640
Save where it intrudes on my girls'
welfare and quality of life and coffee.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.920
Oh, that's nice.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.400
Somebody's got a sense of humor,
or an interesting kink.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.200
Either way, puts a smile on your face.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.200
Last one, double Americano
with oat milk and hazelnut syrup.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.640
Well. Not on your face, Nina love.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.480
Obviously.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.520
Open up! Police!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.640
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello!

01:35.640 --> 01:37.080
What's all this then?

01:39.080 --> 01:40.520
Good morning, officer.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.440
Yes! Exactly!

01:42.800 --> 01:44.680
I'm a human police officer.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.840
Hmm. I thought you probably were.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.800
Did you? Really?

01:49.280 --> 01:50.840
Oh, wonderful.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.440
Well, you're right. I am one.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.640
Jolly good. And err, how can I help you?

01:56.640 --> 01:58.520
Well, sir.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.320
As you may know,
as a human police officer,

02:01.320 --> 02:05.120
I can unobtrusively monitor you
without raising suspicion.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.560
- Indeed you can.
- Great!

02:07.560 --> 02:10.160
Well, could I come in
and do it inside please?

02:10.280 --> 02:13.480
Only cause it's really noisy out here
and I can't hear anything.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.520
By all means.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.040
Cup of tea, officer?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.440
Umm... Yes?

02:37.840 --> 02:40.400
A human police officer would
generally accept a cup of tea.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.880
Ah! Then so shall I.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.600
To drink.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.360
Ah!

03:08.240 --> 03:11.880
You know, I think I'll just look
at mine for a while.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.000
- As you please.
- Great!

03:15.040 --> 03:20.320
I always say the best part
of a "cupperty" is looking at it.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.920
This is ridiculous!

03:25.600 --> 03:28.000
Why don't you just go by train?
You love trains.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.680
Who's this now?

03:30.680 --> 03:32.680
This is a human police officer

03:32.680 --> 03:36.120
who's just popped in
to have a quick look at a cup of tea.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.040
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.320
- Tell me, Constable--
- Inspector.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.360
Oh... You know,
you are dressed as a constable.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.560
Inspector Constable!

03:48.080 --> 03:50.160
- That's my name.
- Of course it is.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.040
First visit to Earth, is it,
by any chance?

03:56.040 --> 03:59.240
Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? Just the--

04:05.920 --> 04:07.280
Or rather, no.

04:07.280 --> 04:12.440
Obviously I've been here
for, like... 200 years.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.680
Oh! But when I said yes just then,

04:14.680 --> 04:18.000
that was an error,
which proves that I'm human.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.600
Of course.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.800
Perhaps you meant
this is your first visit to London?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.800
Yes! That's right.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.360
I was recently transferred
to London from another...

04:29.360 --> 04:30.720
human settlement.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.360
Oh yeah? Which one?

04:36.080 --> 04:37.600
Word with you, Angel, in private.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.360
But, no! But err...
I'm supposed to observe you.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.240
Oh, don't worry.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.240
We can always tell you everything
we talked about afterwards.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.200
Ah, great!

04:50.200 --> 04:51.000
Thanks!

05:06.080 --> 05:09.160
I don't know how you lot have managed
to stay in charge all this time.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.160
I'm not sure we have, have we?

05:11.720 --> 05:14.040
Where's Gabriel?
What is that angel doing here?

05:14.040 --> 05:16.240
<i>Jim</i> is in his bedroom upstairs.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.480
I told him bookshops are
always closed on a Wednesday.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.440
As for Inspector Constable,

05:20.440 --> 05:24.240
at a guess, they were sent
to verify the 25 Lazarii miracle

05:24.360 --> 05:27.200
you and I seem to have accidentally
performed together the other night.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.840
That's how you lot measure miracles?

05:28.840 --> 05:31.400
How many times it could have brought
someone back from the dead?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.800
And I'm very much afraid that...

05:33.440 --> 05:35.960
that angel out there
will establish very quickly

05:35.960 --> 05:38.840
that I lied to Heaven
about the miracle in question.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.280
Right. Well, we just need to get Nina
to do the love thing with Maggie.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.480
One fabulous kiss and we're good.
I have a plan.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.040
Excellent. Can I have the car keys?

05:46.040 --> 05:49.160
Don't you want to hear my plan?
Or, you know, go by train.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.360
Car keys, please.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.040
All done?

05:53.040 --> 05:55.640
Yes! Nothing you need to worry about.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.480
Listen, you wouldn't be interested
in humans falling in love, would you?

05:59.920 --> 06:02.960
I... I know for some members
of the police force it's a bit of a hobby!

06:02.960 --> 06:05.520
Yes! Yes, I am! Oh, especially--

06:05.520 --> 06:07.720
Maggie and Nina over the road. Ah, yes.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.880
Well, we, humans of Earth have a saying:

06:11.280 --> 06:14.880
you can only tell if people are in love
by waiting a few days

06:14.880 --> 06:17.400
because humans are
weird and that's how it works.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.760
Oh... yes! I knew that.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.120
Well, don't hesitate to ask me

06:23.120 --> 06:26.880
if you have any other questions
about love, Inspector... Constable.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.040
I'll just be here helping
to run this bookshop

06:29.040 --> 06:31.680
while my friend drives
my car to Edinburgh.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.520
- Excuse me...
- What? I'm a bit busy.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.280
Yes, I can see that.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.800
But I just needed to ask you
about your love life.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.560
Get out. Now.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.920
Now... We're going to Edinburgh.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.320
<i>From the confidential
journals of A.Z. Fell,</i>

08:40.320 --> 08:42.840
<i>Volume 603.</i>

08:43.440 --> 08:44.600
<i>Dear Diary,</i>

08:44.600 --> 08:49.280
<i>last month Crowley and I both
happened to be in Edinburgh.</i>

08:51.160 --> 08:55.880
<i>And he insisted I visit
a local graveyard at midnight.</i>

08:56.480 --> 08:59.880
<i>He had come upon something
he said that might amuse me.</i>

09:00.600 --> 09:04.640
<i>A statue of the supreme archangel himself!</i>

09:10.880 --> 09:12.520
It's depressingly accurate.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.400
It's definitely Gabriel. It's uncanny.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.120
Do you think he knows?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.760
Probably comes here to stare at it.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.120
Marveling at his own beauty.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.960
I think there's someone here.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.880
This one's mine, ya bastards!

09:30.080 --> 09:32.520
Rather strange time to be burying someone.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.640
I've got a spade.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.640
If the two of you are still here
in ten seconds, I'll use it on you.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.880
I like you!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.720
Dinnae let us stop you.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.000
Oh, this isn't good.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.120
Well, depending on the point of view.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.160
You say potato, I say excellent.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.240
My side are gonna love
a spot of bodysnatchin'.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.040
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm--

09:56.040 --> 09:59.240
- English?
- Mr... McFell.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.640
I just thought I should warn you
that digging up bodies...

10:06.120 --> 10:07.240
Well, it's wrong.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.120
He's not using it anymore.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.520
Just something for his family to cry over.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.360
Now, would you like a wee hand
with your corpse?

10:19.600 --> 10:21.640
<i>I resolved to show this young person</i>

10:21.760 --> 10:23.440
<i>the error of her ways.</i>

10:24.000 --> 10:25.120
It's not an easy job.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.280
If the watch catch you,
you'll swing for it.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.280
It's not the danger
of what you're doing.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.480
Don't you know that it's wrong?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.200
All I know is there's a surgeon
in Newington

10:34.200 --> 10:37.120
who'll give me a great big wodge of cash
for a fresh body like that one.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.120
But you don't have to do this!

10:39.120 --> 10:41.880
- You could be a bookseller.
- I can't read very well.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.960
I don't own a shop.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.080
Well... a weaver then.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.760
- Weaving! Brilliant idea.
- Aye.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.640
Though I can't quite remember
exactly where I left my loom.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.520
Farming.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.320
Bet you left your loom
on your farm, didn't you?

10:54.760 --> 10:57.960
This piss-drenched patch is
where me and my pal sleep.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.800
You alright, wee Morag?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.280
Never better, hen. Never better.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.280
Just trying to keep
wee Morag and me alive.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.280
And it doesn't hurt anyone
who isn't already dead.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.520
So you can shove your morals
up your arse, Mr. McFell.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.680
I've brought you something.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.320
Oh, come on. I've already eaten.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.520
Roasted chicken, butter potatoes,

11:17.520 --> 11:19.600
two helpings of marmalade
pudding for afters.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.800
You're a filthy liar, Elspeth McInnes.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.800
And a wee angel.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.360
Aye.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.760
What's in the barrel, hen?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.320
You didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.520
Oh, she absolutely did.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.760
Nice, fresh, body.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.280
It was just this once!

11:39.280 --> 11:42.280
I promise we can get seven,
even eight pounds for a good one!

11:42.280 --> 11:44.520
We can get a room in a proper
boarding house,

11:44.520 --> 11:45.920
not like the last one.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.600
And you'll never go to bed hungry.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.000
You're going to hell, hen.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.680
Quite right.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.400
It was wonderful to meet you, wee Morag.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.280
There is a stolen body in that barrel!

12:06.280 --> 12:09.200
- This is wicked!
- Oh, I'm down with wicked!

12:10.480 --> 12:12.640
Anyway, is it wicked?
She needed the money.

12:12.640 --> 12:13.600
That is irrelevant.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.720
Look, I am good.
You, I'm afraid, are evil.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.840
But people get a choice.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.000
You know, they cannot be truly holy

12:22.000 --> 12:25.480
unless they also get
the opportunity to be wicked.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.640
She is wicked.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.960
Yeah, that only works
if you start everyone off equal.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.800
You can't start someone off like that

12:33.800 --> 12:35.800
and expect her to do as well
as someone born in a castle.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.240
Ah, but no, no. That's the good bit.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.600
The lower you start,
the more opportunities you have.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.600
So Elspeth here has all the opportunities
because she's so poor.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.520
- That's lunacy.
- No, that's ineffable.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
Now you're getting it.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.120
Oh, that's much better.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.480
What do we do?

13:07.800 --> 13:12.840
We play classical music
that stays classical music.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.800
<i>Angel?
What are you doing?</i>

13:19.920 --> 13:20.720
Nothing.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.800
We're getting along
terribly well together.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.880
<i>You realise I could feel when you drive</i>

13:25.880 --> 13:27.560
<i>the Bentley under the speed limit.</i>

13:31.200 --> 13:33.120
- Well I'm sure you can't.
-<i>I can.</i>

13:33.480 --> 13:36.000
-<i>So put your foot down!</i>
- Alright, alright.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.120
I'm awfully sorry.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.000
It doesn't seem to want to.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.120
<i>Was that a travel sweet?</i>

13:51.760 --> 13:52.560
No.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.480
Hmmm.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.400
<i>My car does not make that noise.</i>

13:58.400 --> 14:00.040
-<i>What are you doing to it?</i>
- Nothing.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.920
<i>You've done something to the car,
haven't you? I can feel it.</i>

14:02.920 --> 14:04.680
I really don't know what you mean.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.480
<i>My car is not yellow.
It has never been yellow.</i>

14:07.480 --> 14:09.560
<i>It is not going to start being yellow now!</i>

14:10.840 --> 14:13.240
-<i>Change it back!</i>
- But it's pretty.

14:13.240 --> 14:17.040
<i>If you don't change it back right now,
I'm gonna start selling people books!</i>

14:17.440 --> 14:19.040
<i>In fact, I might even give some away.</i>

15:02.320 --> 15:04.080
Is there any news about Gabriel yet?

15:04.520 --> 15:05.560
Err, no.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.880
No news of our accursed enemy, my lord.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.760
No?

15:11.720 --> 15:15.360
- Tell me the moment we learn anything.
- Of course, Lord Beelzebub.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.320
Do you ever think,

15:24.840 --> 15:27.800
wouldn't it just be nice if someone
told you what a good job you're doing?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.560
- In hell?
- Yeah.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.600
I mean, I'm just happy
when you don't sentence me

15:32.600 --> 15:34.960
to the Dung Pits for pissing you off.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.880
I mean, a day I don't get sent
to the Dung Pits is a good day.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.400
I mean, as long as there's a day
that nobody rips out my tongue

15:40.400 --> 15:41.280
for talking too much.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.400
A day when nobody sends you
to the Dung Pits

15:44.400 --> 15:46.440
or rips out your tongue for talking too--

15:47.880 --> 15:48.880
Am I talking too much?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.680
Are you gonna rip out my tongue again?

15:53.440 --> 15:55.240
I don't care. Just be quiet.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.200
Right.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.800
- You feeling alright?
- Do you want to go to the Dung Pits?

16:34.240 --> 16:35.080
Gravity.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.640
It's, um... a thing that happens
when objects are pulled together.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.040
In this case, they're all pulled downwards

16:40.040 --> 16:42.360
because the earth is
the largest thing around.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.120
Why?

16:46.160 --> 16:47.080
Ah...

16:48.440 --> 16:50.200
Honestly, um, I don't remember.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.200
Seemed like a good idea
when we were all talking about it.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.880
So things would stay where you put them,
not just drift off.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.680
But it doesn't stay where I put them.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.600
It goes down.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.080
Except for flies, they go up.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.800
Well observed.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.480
Right, so, the plan: Operation Lovebirds.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.560
I'm gonna wait until they both happen
to be near the awning,

17:22.680 --> 17:24.680
then, sudden downpour,

17:25.320 --> 17:28.000
they're back out of the rain,
bump into each other,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.680
look into each other's eyes and vavoom.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.560
- Vavoom?
- That's the plan, yeah.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.800
I haven't done weather in ages.

17:38.320 --> 17:42.000
<i>It was with heavy heart
we arrived at Elspeth's destination.</i>

17:42.640 --> 17:46.240
<i>I was determined to thwart
her monstrous plan.</i>

17:49.640 --> 17:50.760
Doctor Dalrymple?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.560
Mr. Dalrymple, FRCSE.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.480
I'm a surgeon, not a <i>doctor.</i>

17:56.480 --> 18:00.880
I'm sorry to inform you
that this is not pickled herring.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.000
- And I'm afraid I must insist...
- What do you want?

18:04.000 --> 18:08.080
Oh, come on, Mr. Dalrymple,
it's not brain surgery!

18:23.160 --> 18:25.080
You might want to think
about washing your hands.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.720
It's gonna be all the rage in a few years,
I'm telling you.

18:28.080 --> 18:31.320
- You're a funny one, Mister--
- Oh, <i>doctor.</i> I'm not a surgeon.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.800
Of course. Doctor.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.040
<i>It would've taken a miracle</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:38.240
<i>to render that freshly
buried body unsellable.</i>

18:41.800 --> 18:45.760
Oh dear. Something smalls rather... ripe.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.720
Is this a joke?

18:49.720 --> 18:52.160
I'm awfully sorry Mr. Dalrymple.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.240
Oh what a shame.
Such a warm night I suppose.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.480
I can't use this!

18:56.480 --> 18:59.320
It was fine when I--
How did that even--

19:00.160 --> 19:02.080
I tell you what, this one's half price.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.480
I'm not paying a penny
for this... this soup!

19:06.480 --> 19:08.160
You could try fishing out the teeth?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.960
People pay good money
for a nice set of gnashers.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.960
Get this disgusting mess out of here.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.400
You did this, didn't you?

19:17.400 --> 19:19.520
Just an unexpected blessing.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.440
Would you mind?

19:38.560 --> 19:39.640
Ooh. Yeah.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.400
I did a very good thing then.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.800
Now, I don't want Elspeth
coming back here with another body.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.800
Gotta cut off the demand side of things
as well as the supply.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.800
The um, <i>doctor</i> here
and I would be ever so grateful

19:56.800 --> 19:59.760
if we could stay and discuss your work.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.520
Over a good whisky, perhaps.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.800
Doctors!

20:07.720 --> 20:11.560
Perhaps I can interest you in a wee tipple
while we discuss my work?

20:14.240 --> 20:16.240
It's terrible,
buying the bodies.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.320
But I'm trying to teach students
anatomy and basic physiology.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.560
I don't like it any more
than you do, Dr. McFell.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.280
The trouble is there are
never enough murderers.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.240
- I'm sorry?
- Murderers get hanged.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.440
No one cares if we cut up murderers.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.480
Excellent idea! More murders!
I'll drink to that.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.800
But if you're in such dire need of bodies,
why not dig them up yourself

20:39.800 --> 20:43.000
instead of making the poor
and the desperate do it?

20:45.280 --> 20:46.280
Seriously, though?

20:50.040 --> 20:53.040
You cannot possibly think
it is the best use of my time

20:53.040 --> 20:55.720
to be sneaking around in graveyards
in the wee small hours,

20:55.720 --> 20:57.520
risking grave-guns and the noose

20:57.520 --> 21:00.040
instead of teaching
and studying and saving lives.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.280
He's got a point.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.960
- You're both medical men.
- Well...

21:03.960 --> 21:07.320
What is your professional opinion
on that, Doctor?

21:09.440 --> 21:12.280
Well, in my professional opinion,

21:12.280 --> 21:14.200
that seems to be...

21:16.560 --> 21:18.720
I say that seems to me a...

21:20.160 --> 21:22.320
um... well, what do you think?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.480
Well, that's a foot.
So it's definitely not a foot.

21:27.480 --> 21:28.640
That's my point.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.760
If you two smart gentlemen
can't identify it,

21:30.760 --> 21:32.320
then what are my students to make of it?

21:32.880 --> 21:35.960
I removed this tumor
from a seven-year-old boy.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.160
Oh. Oh dear.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.320
And... Is he...?

21:43.080 --> 21:46.680
And that is why we need
a steady supply of cadavers.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.440
We need to cut.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.560
If we can't cut, we can't learn.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.680
If we can't learn more, a lot more,

21:52.680 --> 21:54.440
then how on earth
are we going to win the battle

21:54.440 --> 21:56.080
against monstrosities like this one?

21:57.440 --> 22:00.040
I'm just trying to save lives
and teach students.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.200
I either end up with a knighthood

22:03.480 --> 22:06.320
or condemned as a resurrectionist
and hanging from a rope.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.920
Aha!

22:55.400 --> 22:56.520
Hello there.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.880
Allow me to introduce myself.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.920
I'm what's known as a newspaperman.

23:01.920 --> 23:02.880
Tell me,

23:04.800 --> 23:07.480
is this the Resurrectionist public house?

23:09.160 --> 23:11.840
You'll be one of those investigative
reporters, no doubt?

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
I am!

23:13.400 --> 23:16.600
Well what can I do for you,
and err, what would you like to drink?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.400
Oh, nothing for me.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.680
I'm just here to get the skinny lowdown

23:20.680 --> 23:25.800
on that mysterious song that played itself
on your establishment's jukebox.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.240
That started last year.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.280
Give me the facts.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.480
- Well, it was a Friday evening.
- Fantastic.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.920
Just for what we ink slingers
call "atmosphere",

23:36.440 --> 23:40.720
was this chap by any chance
among those present?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.600
Listen, I serve hundreds of people a week.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.160
I'm not gonna remember some--

23:46.560 --> 23:47.520
Well, yeah.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.800
Aye, okay. I remember him.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.880
- Was he alone?
- Oh no.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.240
- Who was he with?
- Oh, I don't know.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.280
Just... just another Mason.

23:58.120 --> 23:58.920
A Mason?

23:58.920 --> 24:01.240
Ah, well, he's a Mason himself, isn't he?

24:01.240 --> 24:02.960
He was sitting with another one of them.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.360
We often get them in here.
There's a Lodge next door.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.000
It's the first time I've seen one
in a fancy grey suit though.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.240
Was he a big high-up or something?

24:14.200 --> 24:15.480
He certainly used to be.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.760
I don't want your help.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.720
But you were right!

24:31.200 --> 24:33.800
Body snatching alleviates human suffering.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.400
That is a good thing.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.120
- So I can help this time.
- I don't trust you!

24:38.640 --> 24:40.880
I don't know what you did,
but you made that happen.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.760
Aye. Tell that to the poor souls
who will not get into heaven

24:43.760 --> 24:46.000
'cause their bodies are
all chopped into wee pieces.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.240
Well, that isn't how it actually...

24:49.800 --> 24:52.200
Heaven isn't all
it's cracked up to be, you know.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.280
It's no right. I'm telling you.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.640
- Yeah.
- You said you'd help Morag!

24:57.640 --> 24:59.520
Just one body
can get us off the streets...

24:59.520 --> 25:02.200
Aye, I will help,
cause that's what pals do,

25:02.520 --> 25:04.040
but it still doesn't make it right.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.520
That's the spirit!

25:06.040 --> 25:09.680
So, um, as I was saying,
big thumbs up from me.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.560
Dig up as many bodies as you like.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.400
<i>Having realized
the error of my ways,</i>

25:14.400 --> 25:17.160
<i>I resolved to assist Elspeth and wee Morag</i>

25:17.160 --> 25:20.720
<i>in their noble quest
to decrease human suffering.</i>

25:20.720 --> 25:25.440
<i>I took time to inspect various lethal
security devices in that graveyard.</i>

25:25.800 --> 25:27.120
Most ingenious.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.800
You trip this wire, and then...

25:32.320 --> 25:33.120
Boom!

25:34.360 --> 25:37.440
So the rich can afford all this gubbins

25:37.440 --> 25:39.240
to protect their rellies
from being dug up,

25:39.240 --> 25:41.280
and the poor just have to lump it?

25:42.640 --> 25:43.720
You're okay with that, yeah?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.440
- You alright down there, hen?
- Yeah. Almost there, Morag.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.360
It's nice, fresh earth. Easy to dig.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.960
Morag!

26:04.640 --> 26:06.360
<i>Obviously the firing
of the grave-gun</i>

26:06.360 --> 26:08.440
<i>had alerted the local watchman.</i>

26:17.600 --> 26:18.680
It's the watch!

26:35.720 --> 26:37.640
Might've slightly overdone it on the hole.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.480
I am going to save her.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.640
I know it's not
technically allowed, but...

26:56.320 --> 26:58.360
This... this is all my fault.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.520
And I really can't bear it.
If that young woman...

27:02.480 --> 27:03.280
I could heal her.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.200
No, no, no. It's the right thing to do.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.040
I will brook no argu-- What are you...?

27:33.640 --> 27:34.520
Too late.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.200
Will one of you fetch the cart?

27:48.120 --> 27:49.080
Whatever for?

27:50.040 --> 27:51.280
Well, I could be wrong,

27:51.280 --> 27:55.800
but I think Elspeth's taking
wee Morag to Mr. Dalrymple.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.440
- But--
- But what?

27:59.480 --> 28:01.720
I should let her rot
in the ground while I starve?

28:02.240 --> 28:03.440
Is that what you'd have me do, Mr. McFell?

28:03.440 --> 28:06.240
Because it is certainly not
what wee Morag would want.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.520
Well no. No, of course not.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.120
I just... I...

28:11.120 --> 28:14.200
It's a bit different
when it's someone you know, isn't it?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.680
Well, it's not soup, I'll give you that.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.040
She didn't even want
to be in that graveyard.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.240
She only wanted to look after me.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.080
Well, she's done that, hasn't she?

28:36.440 --> 28:37.680
Nice and fresh.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.080
Shall we say five pounds?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.520
Five pounds?

28:41.920 --> 28:44.600
The going rate
for a fresh one's seven, even eight.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.120
You can go and knock on other doors

28:46.120 --> 28:48.240
and see if anyone out there
will give you more for her.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.120
But I'll give you five.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.480
Five. There you go.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.320
Blood money.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.520
And what are you going
to spend it on? Gin?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.480
Wine. For a toast.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.800
Here we are.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.720
Um... Hello, Elspeth.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.000
I'm so sorry about your friend.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.040
It happens. People die.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.800
They do, don't they?

29:47.800 --> 29:50.120
I bought a bottle of good wine
with the proceeds.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.080
Gin's faster. Wine's fancier.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.480
So we can all toast wee Morag.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.840
We'll toast her, then I'm going.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.120
And you can use this money to bury me

29:59.120 --> 30:01.920
Somewhere where no ghouls
will ever dig me back up again.

30:01.920 --> 30:02.960
Going?

30:03.440 --> 30:06.120
- Where are you going?
- To join wee Morag.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.560
So, can we toast her now, please?

30:12.320 --> 30:13.720
No! No, no, no, no!

30:13.720 --> 30:16.280
What did you do that for?
You'll kill yourself!

30:17.840 --> 30:19.800
Constitution of an ox.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.400
Well, I don't need
laudanum to kill myself.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.280
Aw, no dying! Enough dying.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.880
No more dying! No more dying!

30:27.880 --> 30:30.640
Dying is just... it's just...

30:30.640 --> 30:34.280
it's just... wrong!

30:34.280 --> 30:37.080
- Crowley.
- Nah! Nah!

30:37.480 --> 30:40.400
Do I sound like a goat? Neigh!

30:40.400 --> 30:45.000
<i>♪ O Flower of Scotland ♪</i>

30:45.320 --> 30:49.760
<i>♪ When will we see your likes again ♪</i>

30:49.760 --> 30:51.240
Right come on, let's get cracking.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.440
Angel! Angel.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.480
Say something that... convinces her

30:55.480 --> 30:58.640
that poverty is ineffably wonderful
and that life is worth living.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.840
Go on!

31:00.680 --> 31:02.040
Life isn't worth anything.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.120
And then monsters like me
come and dig you back up and--

31:04.120 --> 31:06.280
I have to stop you there. Crowley, I--

31:09.400 --> 31:10.200
Where are you?

31:11.120 --> 31:14.720
Don't you dare step on me!

31:14.720 --> 31:16.160
I see you!

31:16.160 --> 31:20.160
And you, you great... Hmm. Hmm.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.760
I'm small, aren't I?

31:23.760 --> 31:25.320
OK, I can do this.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.480
Stunning view.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.760
Crowley, there really is
no need for any of this--

31:59.760 --> 32:02.480
There is! There you are!

32:03.080 --> 32:05.880
You have sinned very bigly!

32:06.640 --> 32:10.840
Trying to kill yourself is... I mean...

32:10.840 --> 32:12.720
it's... it's not on!

32:13.600 --> 32:18.600
If you dare try to snuff yourself again,

32:18.600 --> 32:21.280
you are damned forever!

32:21.280 --> 32:23.840
- Unless...
- Unless?

32:23.840 --> 32:27.200
Unless... How much have you got
in your wallet?

32:29.520 --> 32:32.880
- Err, me?
- How much, Doctor McFell?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.440
About 90 guineas.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.560
Yeah, that should be enough.
Giver her that.

32:37.560 --> 32:40.640
- Ah...
- But the virtues of poverty...

32:40.640 --> 32:46.000
Ah... She is going to be
shot by a grave gun

32:46.000 --> 32:49.120
or hanged,
if she doesn't top herself first.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.680
Hey! Hmm? Gi'e her the money, angel!

32:52.680 --> 32:55.240
But what am I gonna do with 90 guineas?

32:55.240 --> 32:58.760
Buy a farm, and be good.

32:58.760 --> 33:03.360
Not just pretend good. But properly good.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.360
I promise I will. I promise.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.720
- Do you though?
- Mm.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.160
Nah, that's good enough for me.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.880
Right you are then, hen, off you pop.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.200
Laudenum, whoo-wee!

33:19.200 --> 33:20.800
Last time I do that!

33:21.400 --> 33:24.360
- Where are you?
- I'm here. I'm here.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.880
That was very kind of you, Crowley.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.920
- You saved that young woman.
- Not kind!

33:31.520 --> 33:35.480
Off my head on laudanum.
Not responsible for my actions.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.880
Will you get into trouble?

33:37.920 --> 33:40.200
Well, they'll surely
have noticed downstairs.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.480
You just did a very good deed indeed.

33:43.480 --> 33:47.000
Trust me, if hell noticed
that little display, I'd already be...

33:47.960 --> 33:49.760
Ah... I'd already...

33:53.800 --> 33:56.720
<i>And that was the last
I was to see of Crowley</i>

33:57.040 --> 33:58.600
<i>for quite some time.</i>

34:10.000 --> 34:12.280
Ah! Excuse me!

34:12.400 --> 34:14.520
I hate to be a bother,
but do either of you gentlemen

34:14.520 --> 34:18.160
happen to possess
a mobile phone that I could use?

34:21.080 --> 34:23.680
Are you entirely out of your wee mind?

34:24.840 --> 34:27.640
Err, telephone please.
I don't have all day.

34:27.640 --> 34:29.160
And I did ask nicely.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.960
Oh, I'm so scared.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.080
What will you do if we say no?

34:35.480 --> 34:38.760
I'm out of minutes.
Mostly I just use it for Twitter.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.000
And Grindr.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.920
Ah, that's very kind of you.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.760
Now, I'm afraid
I do need a little privacy.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.800
Um...

34:50.960 --> 34:52.480
Hello. Um...

34:52.880 --> 34:56.920
I'd like you to call the telephone
in my bookshop please, phone.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.160
It's on my desk.

35:13.760 --> 35:14.880
Fell's Bookshop.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.360
We probably don't have
what you're looking for

35:16.360 --> 35:18.000
and we wouldn't sell it to you if we did.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.640
<i>I think I've found some clues.</i>

35:20.760 --> 35:25.280
And do you remember the statue of Gabriel
in the graveyard in Edinburgh?

35:26.160 --> 35:28.160
<i>I'm looking at it now.</i>

35:28.600 --> 35:29.920
Mmm, good job.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.280
Oh, do you really think so?

35:32.640 --> 35:37.320
Um, Crowley...
Do you remember Dr. Dalrymple,

35:37.760 --> 35:40.280
- The one who bought, err...
- <i>Wee Morag's body.</i>

35:40.800 --> 35:43.000
Not a doctor... A mister, yes!

35:43.000 --> 35:47.160
- Yes, whatever happened to him?
- He left Edinburgh in disgrace.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.920
- And then he killed himself.
- Mmm.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.320
- And they named a pub after him.
- Pffft. Humans.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.640
- You don't let yourself get too attached.
- No.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.160
No, I suppose not. Um...

35:57.400 --> 36:00.040
You haven't actually been selling
any of the books, have you?

36:00.760 --> 36:02.000
Not a one.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.680
Oh, good.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.640
- Clue?
- Right!

36:06.640 --> 36:10.880
So... I have unearthed
some vital information.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.640
Gabriel has indeed visited the, um...

36:15.640 --> 36:17.640
establishment in question,

36:18.200 --> 36:21.160
- in company with...
- With?

36:21.960 --> 36:22.840
I don't know. Someone.

36:22.840 --> 36:26.840
<i>But he wasn't alone!
Anyway, that's a proper clue, isn't it?</i>

36:27.440 --> 36:28.960
Ooh, listen. I think it's about to happen.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.160
The awning of a new age.
I'll see you when you get back.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.080
Right.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.800
Blessings be upon you.

36:39.760 --> 36:40.680
And your phone.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.560
And Twitter and Grindr,
whatever they happen to be.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.440
My phone!

36:47.360 --> 36:50.160
Oh! Did you like it better the other way?

36:50.280 --> 36:52.960
No! Whatever you did... thank you!

36:53.280 --> 36:55.040
Ah!

36:58.200 --> 37:00.920
Okay. Okay, rain. I can do rain.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
I just wanted to say that...

37:04.560 --> 37:06.600
I'm not sure
what happened the other night.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.280
But can we talk?

37:12.080 --> 37:14.520
- We don't have anything to talk about.
- I think we do.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.520
You're upset and you're acting
as if it's my fault.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.080
I don't really know
what's going on in your life,

37:19.080 --> 37:22.040
but I know that whatever happened
the other night, I didn't lock us in.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.680
Lovely rainy rain.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.680
I don't know why you're angry with me.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.480
I'm not angry with you. It's just--

37:39.120 --> 37:40.400
It's not about you.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.520
Lindsay decided I must
have been having an affair,

37:42.520 --> 37:44.640
'cause I wasn't texting back,
and I just... I couldn't deal.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.880
That's not fair!

37:46.160 --> 37:49.080
I mean, I'd never... and we didn't!
It was the power going out.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.560
Oh come on, under the awning!

37:51.000 --> 37:52.680
Proper hard rain!

38:00.200 --> 38:03.400
I mean we're not having a...
What your partner said.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.520
I know we're not!

38:06.040 --> 38:08.320
- I suppose I owe you an apology.
- No, you don't.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.000
It's just... I'd never...

38:12.280 --> 38:13.520
I'm not that kind of person.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.320
I know. I'm not your type.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.520
You have no idea.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.440
Oh, yes. It's working.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.520
Oh! Ooh...

38:35.520 --> 38:36.560
Oh, bugger!

38:37.000 --> 38:38.440
Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger!

38:40.200 --> 38:42.040
Hmm, that could've gone better.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.160
Did they vavoom?

38:43.280 --> 38:44.960
I think it's fair to say, Jim,

38:44.960 --> 38:49.160
that vavooming was not the end result
of that particular tempest.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.560
There will come a tempest,

38:56.080 --> 38:58.840
and darkness, and great storms.

38:59.160 --> 39:02.440
And the dead will leave their graves
and walk the earth once more.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.880
And there will be great lamentations.

39:05.880 --> 39:06.640
Go on.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.920
Every day it's getting closer.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.520
What are we talking about now?

39:22.600 --> 39:24.480
Who am I? What's happened to me?

39:28.280 --> 39:29.280
Stay here.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.960
Don't open the door to anyone.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.520
Shax? Where are you?

39:48.320 --> 39:49.920
Excuse me, do you know where...

39:51.040 --> 39:54.080
You've got Gabriel hiding in the bookshop,
haven't you, Crowley?

39:54.080 --> 39:55.640
Sorry mate, I'm a stranger here myself!

39:55.760 --> 39:56.640
Oi! Pillock!

39:56.640 --> 40:00.000
- Beelzebub's not happy with you.
- Oh really? Beelzebub?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.160
Not happy?

40:01.280 --> 40:03.640
But they're always
such a little ray of sunshine!

40:04.600 --> 40:06.600
They're seriously not happy.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.480
Beelzebub knows the angel's
hiding him in there.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.840
- No, they don't.
- What makes you so sure?

40:13.080 --> 40:14.280
Because they can't?

40:14.280 --> 40:16.920
- Why not?
- Because he isn't!

40:16.920 --> 40:18.200
I'm not playing these games.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.880
I'm not stupid, Crowley.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.840
- Come on, let me in.
- Yeah. Not gonna happen,

40:25.840 --> 40:27.560
so just... excuse me.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.840
Ah, he's in there.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.680
You think so?

40:37.360 --> 40:39.480
I'm surprised you haven't popped in
for a quick poke around.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.640
You know I can't step over the threshold.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.120
Oh. Shame I can't invite you in.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.280
You're welcome to look
all you want from there.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.800
Maybe you'll spot an archangel.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.280
Hello, customer!

40:54.640 --> 40:57.600
Listen, when there's no hot water

40:57.600 --> 41:00.280
and two yellow lights
on the boiler, what is that?

41:00.280 --> 41:02.640
Oh, yeah, yeah. That happens.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.400
There's a little black tap
on a silver loop you have to turn.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.560
- It's sort of under--
- Yeah, I can find it.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.320
- And if you won't let me in...
- Not technically something I can do.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.760
Beelzebub and the Dark Council
and all the forces of Hell

41:14.760 --> 41:17.320
will declare war.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.800
- On me?
- On your friend.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.840
- Where is he by the way?
- Stocktaking.

41:24.840 --> 41:25.760
In the basement.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.280
You have no idea the trouble
you're causing, do you?

41:39.680 --> 41:42.640
No. Or yes. Or... no.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.520
Yeah. I'll tell you something Jim,

41:45.160 --> 41:47.120
or Gabriel, if you're in there somewhere.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.640
If any harm comes to Aziraphale
because of this, I will...

41:51.520 --> 41:52.320
Yes?

41:54.920 --> 41:57.320
Oh, it doesn't matter.
It's too late for that now, isn't it?

42:00.080 --> 42:01.520
It's always too late.
