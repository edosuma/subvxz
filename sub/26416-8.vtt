WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.265
I give you mercy.

00:05.614 --> 00:07.224
Previously on Z Nation.

00:07.790 --> 00:10.227
Why the big mystery
around these bizkits anyway?

00:10.271 --> 00:11.489
Nobody likes to talk about

00:11.533 --> 00:13.143
the fact that they contain
human brain matter.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.015
Well where are they getting
the brains from then?

00:15.058 --> 00:17.800
The bizkit bakery is on the edge
of the no go zone.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.019
There's the bakery.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.368
It looks abandoned.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.504
I love the smell of fresh baked
brains in the morning.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.071
I'll take Addy and 10K.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.813
We'll go to Heartland
and figure out this flour thing.

00:30.856 --> 00:31.553
Be careful.

00:51.355 --> 00:54.184
Okay, what about the video
where the cat

00:54.228 --> 00:56.969
like totally protects a toddler
from an attacking dog?

00:57.013 --> 00:59.885
Like comes like tearing around,
claws and fangs,

00:59.929 --> 01:02.584
and the dog turns tail
and scrams?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.848
We only used the internet
for ordering guns.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.939
Okay, keyboard cat?

01:09.982 --> 01:13.725
Okay, you have to have seen
keyboard cat. He was everywhere.

01:13.769 --> 01:17.120
Oh yeah. I think I heard of him.
He...like...types?

01:21.777 --> 01:25.433
What is the deal with cat videos
anyway? Dogs are way cooler.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.783
Dogs can't play piano.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.787
These fields
need to be harvested.

01:31.830 --> 01:32.918
They're going to seed.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.442
A friend of mine

01:34.485 --> 01:36.922
helped me move a group of
Talkers from here to Limbo.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.402
But I don't know how many

01:38.446 --> 01:41.057
live humans are left
to work the fields.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.153
Welcome to Heartland.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.329
What's the plan?

01:53.025 --> 01:55.202
Make contact with the locals and

01:55.245 --> 01:58.379
see what we find out about
what's in these bizkits.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.163
And then what?

02:00.729 --> 02:02.948
What's our end game here?

02:04.124 --> 02:08.128
Help George with this idea
of hers. A new country.

02:09.912 --> 02:13.437
I don't think we're the
nation

02:13.481 --> 02:16.397
More like the
tear-shit-up types.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.487
Whoever controls the supply of
bizkits controls the new world.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.794
And we want to make sure that we
got the right people in charge.

02:22.838 --> 02:23.621
Uh huh.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.188
Like George?

02:26.450 --> 02:30.019
She's a natural leader.
That's who you want in battle.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.543
Yeah, but you pick your battles.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.980
Bodies up ahead.
At least two of them.

02:38.114 --> 02:38.941
Mercied?

02:38.984 --> 02:40.551
Looks like it.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.945
Yeah, there's another one here.

02:43.424 --> 02:44.425
Then another.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.091
Farm workers.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.224
Some of them are Talkers.

03:01.833 --> 03:05.750
Looks like somebody didn't want
these bizkits to be made.

03:05.794 --> 03:09.841
Feed...us...

03:11.016 --> 03:12.235
You hear that?

03:12.279 --> 03:17.327
Feed...us...

03:24.813 --> 03:25.553
Psst.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.443
Feed...me.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.846
Feed us,

03:58.803 --> 04:00.588
please.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.028
Come out.

04:06.071 --> 04:10.162
Feed...us...

04:10.206 --> 04:12.077
bizkits.

04:23.654 --> 04:28.268
Feed...us...brains.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.316
10K! Heads up!

04:33.360 --> 04:34.361
I see them.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.884
Oh no, don't shoot.
That's a Talker.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.625
Are you sure?
He looks pretty bad.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.669
She's right.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.149
If he's still talking,

04:40.497 --> 04:42.151
he might know something.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.632
Follow my lead.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.900
I love it when she says that.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.697
We come in peace!

05:07.045 --> 05:09.657
We hear that you're hungry!

05:09.700 --> 05:12.747
But we don't have any bizkits!

05:12.790 --> 05:14.618
But we can help you!

05:14.662 --> 05:16.925
What happens when Talkers
stop talking?

05:16.968 --> 05:19.580
Umm, I'm guessing

05:19.623 --> 05:20.320
not good.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.365
We don't want to hurt you!

05:22.409 --> 05:23.932
Okay, back off! Back off!

05:23.975 --> 05:25.063
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't hurt them.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.282
I'm trying.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.024
Guys, we are drawing a crowd.
We got to get out of here.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.505
Okay, look. There's a farmhouse
in the distance.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.680
Let's make this non-lethal.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.812
On three. One. Two.

05:34.856 --> 05:35.813
Someone's coming!

05:37.641 --> 05:38.338
Doc!

05:39.164 --> 05:39.817
Yes.

05:39.861 --> 05:40.862
Get in!

05:52.961 --> 05:54.223
Good timing.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.268
We got your message from Kaya.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.792
Where you headed?

05:57.835 --> 05:59.794
Ah, farmhouse.
It's right up ahead.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.362
Good. Cuz that's about
all the gas we got left.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.712
Hey, punkin'.

06:04.755 --> 06:05.974
Hey, buddy.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.108
Poor baby.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.850
You must be starved.

06:13.982 --> 06:18.639
Well I know where you can find
some nice tasty brains.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.468
It's just waiting to be nibbled.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.688
Why don't you go after them?

06:37.005 --> 06:40.748
Well that's about all she wrote.
I think we're running on fumes.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.168
Talkers.
They're hiding in the wheat.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.040
They look hungry.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.259
But they haven't turned yet.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.391
What are they eating?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
I know! I know!

07:20.048 --> 07:21.397
Brains.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.468
Hey, buddy.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.210
So the Talkers
have been eating your brains?

07:52.254 --> 07:55.300
Everybody wants
a piece of Charlie.

07:55.997 --> 07:56.911
Hey.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.696
Charlie, what happened here?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.657
I forgot.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.485
I think they ate that part.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.616
Probably a good thing.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.183
So, buddy?

08:08.226 --> 08:10.881
Are you here alone?
Is anybody else here?

08:20.238 --> 08:22.153
I'm not sure.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.728
Hey, you.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.645
Wanna talk about what happened
to Dante?

08:39.083 --> 08:41.172
It's my fault.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.174
I shouldn't have let him go.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.436
That's not true.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.569
It is true, Doc.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.137
It is.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.618
He put his trust in me.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.707
In what I believed in.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.537
And it got him killed.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.103
What?

08:59.147 --> 09:00.148
You got Dante killed?

09:00.191 --> 09:01.192
Addy.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.238
Hey.

09:04.587 --> 09:05.936
What happened?

09:15.163 --> 09:17.426
Vigilantes got him.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.908
Killed the Captain
and his guard too.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.911
Probably the same bastards
that killed the others.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.705
I'm so sorry.

09:40.928 --> 09:44.627
They chopped him up
into pieces

09:45.193 --> 09:48.022
and put him in a trash can.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.982
He did it for me.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.075
He was still alive.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.599
Oh my god.

10:02.427 --> 10:05.605
I had to mercy him.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.044
You did right.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.524
Who would do that?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.396
Who would do that?

10:14.439 --> 10:15.615
Humans.

10:15.658 --> 10:16.616
Maybe not.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.793
Maybe Talkers.

10:19.836 --> 10:23.927
They left a sign saying, "This
is what happens to traitors."

10:23.971 --> 10:25.755
You know, Newmerica

10:25.799 --> 10:27.278
would be a much better place

10:27.322 --> 10:29.890
if you just got rid of
all of the people.

10:32.370 --> 10:36.200
Maybe the zombies got it right.
Screw everyone.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.640
Hey.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.164
Listen to me.

10:43.599 --> 10:46.471
We will find
whoever's behind this, and we

10:46.515 --> 10:48.517
will bring them to justice.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.392
I can't give up.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.267
I can't let Dante's death
be in vain.

11:01.312 --> 11:04.664

Shut your mouth.

Oh, yeah, nevermind.
Let's try to clean that up.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.420
Well I don't think
we should use that water.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.249
Yeah, no.
I got a perfect plan B.

Ow!

Well, Ms. Carver, looks like you
have me right where you want me.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.398
I should kill you right now.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.313
Put me out of my misery.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.230
Or I could make you wish
you were dead.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.886
What do you want me to do?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.019
Unbutton your shirt.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.324
Seriously?

14:07.368 --> 14:10.632
Okay. Okay.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.249
More.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.165
All right.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.558
All right.

14:38.921 --> 14:39.835
Now what?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.533
Kiss me.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.666
Thought you'd never ask,
Sundance.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.193
Finn, you bastard!
You stood me up!

14:50.237 --> 14:51.629
No!

14:51.673 --> 14:52.630
I waited two days for you.
I thought you were dead.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.981
You know how it is. Zombies.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.113
At least you're alive.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.245
Yeah,

14:58.593 --> 15:00.725
but I don't know for how long.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.076
What do you mean?

15:05.643 --> 15:06.601
What happened?

15:06.644 --> 15:08.559
Someone shot me.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.388
Finn! Finn!

15:12.737 --> 15:15.610
Okay, 10K.
This might sting a little.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.181
Yeah, that looks like
it really hurts.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.620
No, I wouldn't drink...

15:29.102 --> 15:30.581
Oh.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.463
I feel great.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.122
Well that'll take your mind
off your hand for a while.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.515
Everything okay?

15:51.559 --> 15:53.648
Just a little alcohol poisoning.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.129
He should be fine in a day
or three.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.086
Three?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.350
Maybe less if you keep that up.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.745
All right, I got you.

16:03.788 --> 16:04.876
Here.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.401
Look at that.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.837
Just relax, 10K.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.145
And if you get the spins, put
your head between your knees.

16:18.847 --> 16:22.155
Talkers are still lurking around
out there.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.330
A little help!

16:25.462 --> 16:27.377
This is my friend Finn.
He's been shot.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.988
I'm fine, really.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.382
Doc?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
Hey, you. Feeling better?

16:37.257 --> 16:39.259
Yeah, now that the bleeding
stopped.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.521
He's still alive.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.873
But he's lost a lot of blood.
So keep your eye on him.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.180
You are a very lucky man.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.529
The wound was that bad?

16:48.572 --> 16:51.401
No, I'm just a terrible doctor.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.837
Okay.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.799
Ah, my next patient.
If you'll excuse me.

16:58.974 --> 17:02.369
Okay,
how do you guys know each other?

17:02.978 --> 17:06.155
When some of my farmhands
turned Talker,

17:06.199 --> 17:07.678
Addy was part of
the network of people

17:07.722 --> 17:09.419
who helped me get them safely
to Limbo.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.814
Yeah, we just kinda hit it off.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.991
And he actually helped me save
a lot of Talkers.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.471
We're like Butch and Sundance.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.951
What happened
to the rest of the farmers?

17:21.083 --> 17:24.043
By the time I made it back,
they'd all been killed.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.305
Converted to Talkers.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.223
And Charlie?

17:30.266 --> 17:30.614
Yes?

17:31.180 --> 17:32.616
What about me?

17:32.660 --> 17:34.923
You, Charlie,

17:34.966 --> 17:36.620
volunteered to make
the ultimate sacrifice

17:36.664 --> 17:37.839
to save all your friends.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.232
I did?

17:40.146 --> 17:41.930
Yeah, you did.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.281
Been keeping the Talkers
from going full Z

17:45.325 --> 17:47.370
by feeding them tiny bits
of Charlie's brain.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.111
Oh, yeah.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.940
Had them all rounded up and calm
ready for the trip to Limbo,

17:51.983 --> 17:54.377
when someone shot me
and set them all loose.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.945
Whoever it is, they don't
want us making bizkit flour.

17:56.988 --> 18:00.427
They stole all the ingredients
we add to the flour we mill here

18:00.470 --> 18:02.820
So, do you know the
secret ingredient in it?

18:02.864 --> 18:04.561
It's not brains.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.737
But beyond that, I have no idea.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.261
Show you what's left.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.131
Please.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.705
Flour comes in here
from the mill above us.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.447
The grain is ground by power
from the water up stream.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.971
But the stream dried up the
same night as the first attack.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.582
This machine here mixes
the brain powder into the flour.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.671
Then we bag it up
and ship it out.

18:27.715 --> 18:28.803
This the brain powder?

18:28.846 --> 18:29.195
Yes'm.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.676
We put one of those in
for every 400 pounds.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.025
And they took all of it?

18:34.069 --> 18:34.722
Yep.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.550
Got a little flour left,

18:36.593 --> 18:38.900
but they took all
the added ingredients.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.341
This is a big operation.

18:45.385 --> 18:48.083
Yeah, we're pretty much
the only source in the area.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.564
Not just for bizkits,
but for all our grain.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.696
Not that much seed left.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.133
We should be getting ready
to harvest,

18:54.176 --> 18:55.482
fill these up again soon.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.701
Without water and labor,
that's not gonna get done.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.442
All of Newmerica could starve.

18:59.486 --> 19:00.835
Exactly.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.185
So,

19:03.925 --> 19:05.361
you had a fire?

19:05.405 --> 19:06.667
Yeah,
they tried to burn it down.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.321
Damn near did it too.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.236
Charlie and I came out here
to put it out,

19:10.279 --> 19:11.193
and they attacked us.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.368
That how you got shot?

19:12.412 --> 19:14.196
Yeah. Charlie got a machete
to the head.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.067
Did you get a good look at them?

19:16.111 --> 19:17.199
Not really.

19:17.243 --> 19:17.678
Come on.
You had to have seen something.

19:17.721 --> 19:18.244
Hey.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.333
He said he didn't see anything.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.161
We were being attacked
from all sides.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.729
So, if you got workers, you
think you still could harvest?

19:25.773 --> 19:26.469
Got the workers.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.211
Just got to round them up
and feed them bizkits.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.520
You're bleeding again. You've
really got to take it easy.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.914
We'll help you round up
some farmhands!

19:41.484 --> 19:44.661
I was in the goat rodeo
one time!

19:44.705 --> 19:48.404
Yippy ty ay, grape shmuckers.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.797
Oh my god.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.668
What could go wrong?

19:52.365 --> 19:53.670
Well,

19:54.497 --> 19:57.761
looks like somebody
wants to play cowboy.

19:58.849 --> 20:02.157
Let's send them a stampede.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.477
Here they come.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.956
All right, Charlie.
That's your cue.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.527
All right, you brain lovers.

20:24.571 --> 20:29.663
Come get your brains.
Come get your brains!

20:32.535 --> 20:36.844
Fresh brains!
Get your fresh brains!

20:43.764 --> 20:47.028
Hey, take a breath. Come on.

20:47.071 --> 20:47.985
I'm fine.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.251
No, you're not. You're still
in shock over Dante.

20:53.730 --> 20:57.256
Listen, there's some things
we aren't meant to see.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.477
I need you to get your head
in it.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.699
Here they come.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.446
Just like old times, huh?

21:14.490 --> 21:17.145
Like a month ago

21:17.188 --> 21:19.060
That's old for the Apocalypse.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.149
Okay, yeah, yeah.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.630
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

21:23.673 --> 21:27.373
I was worried about trying
to do this just me and Charlie.

21:29.592 --> 21:30.680
You gonna be okay?

21:30.724 --> 21:32.682
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.261
Just killing stuff
is a lot easier.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.917
I know. Keeping stuff alive,
way harder.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.355
Okay, that's him.

21:55.139 --> 21:59.535
Hot brains. Get your hot brains!

22:01.102 --> 22:04.366
How bout a little Sriracha?

22:04.410 --> 22:10.677
Woo. Now that's spicy.
Just the way you like it!

22:10.720 --> 22:13.070
Well hello, Joe. Howdy, Alma.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.464
Guess what's on the menu today?

22:15.508 --> 22:16.291
Now.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.170
Now, Charlie!

22:26.562 --> 22:27.694
Quick!

22:31.219 --> 22:32.525
Please.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.576
There, boy. There, boy.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.070
Get back here, you.

23:40.593 --> 23:41.985
Damnit, hold still!

23:42.029 --> 23:44.161
This is for your own good!

23:47.469 --> 23:50.037
Yippie-ti-yo-ki-yay.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.137
Little help!

24:07.794 --> 24:09.143
Hang on, partner!

24:09.709 --> 24:10.884
Don't mercy him!

24:10.927 --> 24:12.189
Oh yeah, that's right.

24:13.756 --> 24:14.496
Take it easy. Calm down. Calm
down. You'll get your brains.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.541
Just stop fighting!

24:15.584 --> 24:16.846
He's too far gone!

24:16.890 --> 24:17.891
All right, that's enough!

24:19.588 --> 24:20.633
Sorry.

24:23.157 --> 24:23.853
Is he dead?

24:23.897 --> 24:24.941
He was already dead.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.377
I think I just stunned him.

24:26.421 --> 24:29.729
Quick, let's tie him up
before the others come back.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.517
You know what they say.

24:35.561 --> 24:40.000
You want something done right,
you just have to do it yourself.

24:42.350 --> 24:45.484
Let's go nip this revolution
in the bud.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.359
Watch yourself.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.710
These Talkers
have almost completely turned.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.409
It's gonna take most of
Charlie's childhood memories

24:58.453 --> 25:00.542
just to get them talking again.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.155
Over here. In the shadows.

25:06.156 --> 25:07.593
I see it.

25:09.029 --> 25:11.161
That one got away.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.685
Let's get this one.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.687
I'll go this way.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.471
Hey, buddy.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.299
I know you're scared.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.823
Okay, I'm scared too.

25:21.258 --> 25:24.218
All right?
It's a scary world these days.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.094
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.443
I promise.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.146
I know it must be terrifying,

25:39.929 --> 25:42.453
being awake while dead.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.805
Hey, we have brains for you.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.590
We have a volunteer.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.723
At least I think
he's a volunteer.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.724
Charlie.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.597
He's generously donated enough
brains to keep you human

25:55.641 --> 25:57.207
till we get more bizkits.

25:57.468 --> 26:00.123
How does that sound, huh?

26:00.167 --> 26:03.300
Some delicious juicy
fresh brains.

26:04.911 --> 26:09.176
All we have to do is secure you
for your own safety, okay?

26:13.528 --> 26:14.921
Get over here, get over here.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.184
Come on.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.932
It was nice while it lasted.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.457
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.417
There you are!

26:33.461 --> 26:35.594
Come on, you.
It's for your own good.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.074
Hey Doc,
I got another one over here!

26:39.119 --> 26:44.603
We'll get you some brains, and
you'll be human-ish in no time.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.039
It's okay, ma'am.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.345
No need to be afraid.
We're not going to hurt you.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.388
Sorry, kid.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.399
I couldn't help it, man.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.272
You good?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.973
All right, let's corral
these two.

28:02.593 --> 28:05.161
All right, all right.
Easy there, partner.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.904
What is it we're doing again?

28:08.948 --> 28:12.255
We're gonna feed the Talkers
so they don't turn zombie.

28:12.299 --> 28:13.692
Right.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.956
What are we feeding them with?

28:17.870 --> 28:20.437
Well, actually, brains.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.222
Your brains.

28:24.964 --> 28:28.228
Ohh. Yeah.

28:28.881 --> 28:32.014
And I was cool with that, right?

28:32.058 --> 28:34.190
As far as we know.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.977
Okay. Well let's get started.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.674
All right, everybody, back up!
Back up!

28:39.718 --> 28:42.242
I need two lines.
One here, one here.

28:42.285 --> 28:45.332
Come on. I know you can do it.
Back up.

29:10.705 --> 29:11.706
We need to find out

29:13.099 --> 29:14.274
who's trying to cut off
the supply of these bizkits.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.798
Couldn't be Talkers.
Wouldn't make any sense.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.366
Unless you were trying
to stir up a revolution.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.935
Look, people and Talkers
are easier to manipulate

29:22.978 --> 29:24.153
when they're starving.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.547
We can't let the worst of us
win.

29:26.982 --> 29:30.116
We need to fix this country now
while we still have a chance.

29:30.159 --> 29:33.249
Dante died trying to unite
humans and Talkers.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.817
Whoever killed him
needs to be brought to justice.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.515
Look, we need Talkers
more than they need us.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.301
This world belongs to
the dead now, not us.

29:41.344 --> 29:44.043
Maybe it's not our land
to claim anymore.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.218
What?

29:46.872 --> 29:50.136
So what, we just give it all
to the zombies?

29:50.179 --> 29:51.920
The Talkers need us too.

29:52.573 --> 29:55.228
We both need each other
to survive.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.186
We can't do this alone.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.363
That's why we need
a new country.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.104
A future
we can all have a stake in.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.672
So far, this new country of
yours has done nothing

30:04.715 --> 30:07.675
except get people killed.
Including Dante.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.159
Maybe you're right.

30:14.638 --> 30:18.120
Maybe I am responsible
for Dante's death.

30:18.164 --> 30:23.299
And that is something that will
haunt me until my mercy comes.

30:23.909 --> 30:27.216
But it is not up to you
to judge me.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.611
Not everybody shares
your dreams.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.396
And certainly not
your way of doing things.

30:34.745 --> 30:36.530
Okay, this is cute.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.967
But we're on the same team here.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.317
There's no time for politics.

30:41.361 --> 30:45.887
Like it or not, we are fighting
the same fight together.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.889
We are at war.

30:47.933 --> 30:51.327
And we don't even know
who the hell we're fighting.

31:02.991 --> 31:08.736
Daisy,
give me your hand. Please do.

31:08.779 --> 31:16.091
I'm so crazy.
All on account of you.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.051
Okay, that's the last
of the medulla oblongata

31:19.094 --> 31:21.227
with a side of sriracha.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.620
How you feeling, Charlie?

31:23.664 --> 31:25.579
I'm feeling a little
light headed.

31:25.622 --> 31:26.449
Yeah?

31:27.668 --> 31:30.497
Finn? Finn,
I think I need to sit down.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.070
How's he doing?

31:38.766 --> 31:40.028
Not good.

31:40.072 --> 31:46.992
I'm so crazy-zy-zy.

31:48.689 --> 31:52.388
All on account of you.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.477
Is it time, Finn?

31:55.565 --> 31:57.567
Yeah, I think so, Charlie.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.700
We saved them all cuz of you.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.007
That's good.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.661
Can I have my mercy now?

32:04.705 --> 32:06.359
Sure, Charlie.

32:12.408 --> 32:13.757
Goodbye, Charlie.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.324
Bye, Finn.

32:16.543 --> 32:20.460
Goodbye,
whoever the rest of you are.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.157
Bye, Charlie.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.943
Have mercy.

32:27.815 --> 32:33.081
Daisy, Daisy. Give me...

32:36.911 --> 32:38.826
Mercy.

32:57.366 --> 33:03.459
Daisy, Daisy,
give me your hand. Please do.

33:03.503 --> 33:10.379
I'm so crazy.
All on account of you.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.686
I'm so crazy.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.731
Okay, that was weird.

33:20.563 --> 33:23.697
Even if we weren't under attack,
the crops would die from drought

33:23.740 --> 33:25.090
They cut off our water supply.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.961
Who controls the water?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.310
The Water Keepers.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.444
Group of First Nations people
that settled at the reservoir.

33:31.487 --> 33:32.445
They operate the dam.

33:33.968 --> 33:34.838
They cut off our flow of water
and the hydroelectricity

33:34.882 --> 33:36.753
right after the first attack.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.407
Haven't been able to
make contact with them since.

33:38.451 --> 33:39.626
I know the chief.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.803
He was a civil engineer pre-Z.
He's the one that runs the dam.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.500
He'll know what's going on.

33:44.544 --> 33:47.503
Well, we're going to go talk
to some Water Keepers.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.549
Follow the dry irrigation ditch
the whole way.

33:49.592 --> 33:50.811
It'll take you right to them.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.378
Normally, it'd be a swim
this time of year.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.684
I'll stay here,
keep an eye on the Talkers.

33:54.728 --> 33:58.514
As soon as they're ready to
travel, I'll take them to Limbo.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.734
Great plan. Nice to meet you.

34:28.892 --> 34:33.027
If you don't knock that off,
I won't hesitate to mercy you.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.812
God, I hate that song.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.077
Oh.

34:39.425 --> 34:41.818
Looky what we have here.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.267
Looks like y'all are feeling
more like yourselves.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.660
I'm gonna give Charlie
a proper burial.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.053
Pull together some supplies.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.491
We'll set off for Limbo
after dark. Safer then.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.508
Won't be long now

35:20.944 --> 35:22.816
before someone starts playing
for the other team.

35:27.429 --> 35:30.084
My hand hurts
like it was still there.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.043
Oh, there's a name for that.
Phantom limb syndrome.

35:33.087 --> 35:35.524
It's when the brain
thinks the hand is still there,

35:35.568 --> 35:37.700
so it keeps sending
these pain signals.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.138
But don't worry,
it eventually works itself out

35:40.181 --> 35:42.357
and the brain
just starts to ignore it.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.707
I don't think my brain
is ever gonna get used to this.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.580
Looks like there hasn't
been water here in a while.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.756
I just can't figure out why
the Water Keepers would just

35:49.799 --> 35:51.497
cut off the water and the power.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.282
Maybe they don't want to be a
part of George's new world order

35:54.326 --> 35:56.023
There's some truth to that.

35:56.502 --> 35:59.635
They're very independent,
and they've been burned before.

35:59.679 --> 36:03.378
But the chief's a very smart
man. Very fact oriented.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.903
He saw that the positives
outweighed the negatives.

36:06.947 --> 36:10.124
He supported the referendum.

36:10.168 --> 36:10.864
I dunno.

36:11.952 --> 36:12.779
Maybe there's trouble
at the dam.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.476
Hey, hey. Are you okay, kid?

36:14.520 --> 36:17.131
Oh yeah.
I think I'm just hungover.

36:17.523 --> 36:19.220
Man, you're burning up.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.395
Baby boy?

36:20.743 --> 36:21.962
I'm fine.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.920
You're not fine.
The kid needs antibiotics.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.661
Is there anything
back at the farm?

36:25.705 --> 36:28.186
I think we used the last of it
on Finn.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.883
The Water Keepers
will have something.

36:29.926 --> 36:33.103
Yeah, we know all about that
Native American medicine.

36:33.147 --> 36:36.803
But we were nowhere near
the Grand Canyon.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.587
Okay.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.285
If you say so.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.157
That's a distress signal.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.854
It's coming from the farm. Finn!

36:44.898 --> 36:47.988
Doc, get 10K and take cover.
We'll be right back.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.383
Finn!

37:01.610 --> 37:02.829
What happened?

37:04.265 --> 37:06.441
Two of the Talkers jumped me.
Set the others free.

37:06.789 --> 37:09.357
Okay, we'll go round them up.

37:11.054 --> 37:14.667
Hey, hey. Hang in there, baby.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.625
I lost too much blood.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.802
I'm scared, Addy.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.631
I didn't think I'd be scared.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.068
Don't be afraid. I'm right here.

37:26.983 --> 37:27.636
Shh.

37:49.005 --> 37:51.312
Hey, Alma. It's me.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.056
No.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.282
Okay, all right.

38:15.467 --> 38:16.381
George!

38:17.251 --> 38:18.383
George!

38:31.004 --> 38:33.180
I had big plans for us.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.879
Hey.
We can still do big things.

38:38.272 --> 38:38.707
Addy?

38:38.751 --> 38:39.665
Right here.

38:39.708 --> 38:40.709
Right here.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.276
Promise me you'll keep our deal.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.408
Of course.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.801
If I don't like it,
you'll mercy me.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.107
I promise.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.590
Think I'll see a white light?

38:52.504 --> 38:55.333
I don't think it works like that
anymore.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.948
It hurts.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.297
I know.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.650
I'm scared.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.566
I don't want to turn.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.439
Hey, don't fight it.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.402
I love you, Addy.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.798
I love you, Finn.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.496
It's time to go.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.481
Hey.

39:59.266 --> 40:00.485
Hi.

40:02.487 --> 40:03.226
So?

40:05.751 --> 40:07.709
Nothing hurts.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.452
Okay.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.981
I'm not afraid anymore.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.506
Eight years,

40:22.463 --> 40:25.379
every day since day one,
I've been afraid.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.599
And now I'm not.

40:31.211 --> 40:32.995
I saved you something.

40:36.651 --> 40:39.437
It's the last piece of Charlie.

40:44.572 --> 40:45.921
Thanks.

40:54.234 --> 40:56.279
We rounded up all the Talkers.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.151
Except for two.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.153
Probably the ones
that jumped you.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.155
Did he?

41:04.418 --> 41:05.724
Welcome back.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.510
Good to be back.

41:09.554 --> 41:12.339
George and I are gonna catch up
with Doc and 10K.

41:15.690 --> 41:16.909
You coming?

41:17.997 --> 41:19.999
I'm gonna stay here with Finn.

41:20.695 --> 41:23.959
Just to help him get these
Talkers back to Limbo.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.047
But after that...

41:25.526 --> 41:26.440
Sure.

41:27.572 --> 41:28.311
Love you, sis.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.574
You too.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.314
Nice to meet you, man.

41:31.358 --> 41:31.880
Pleasure.

41:31.924 --> 41:32.838
Take care.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.404
Take care of each other.

41:34.448 --> 41:35.318
You too.

41:44.284 --> 41:45.677
See you in Newmerica.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.113
Keep dreaming.

41:47.156 --> 41:48.897
Somebody has to.

41:55.164 --> 41:57.253
Where the hell are they?

42:01.736 --> 42:03.564
Damn, kid.

42:04.043 --> 42:06.872
Well it seems to be healing
okay.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.921
Look, if Warren and them
aren't back soon,

42:13.226 --> 42:16.229
we should just head to the dam
without them.

42:17.796 --> 42:19.058
How you feeling?

42:19.972 --> 42:21.408
You look better.

42:22.496 --> 42:23.628
Your fever broke.

42:24.629 --> 42:25.978
Have a sip.

42:34.769 --> 42:37.946
I sure hope these Water Keepers
are friendly.

42:42.037 --> 42:43.952
You got to be kidding.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.172
Doc?!
