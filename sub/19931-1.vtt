00:11.501 --> 00:15.000
(upbeat electronic music)

02:39.292 --> 02:40.292
- What the fuck?

02:40.292 --> 02:41.751
That joint was supposed to go to me.

02:41.751 --> 02:44.459
What, instead it went to
little Darby Crash over there?

02:44.459 --> 02:45.584
- He was cute enough.

02:45.584 --> 02:47.501
- We'll see about that.

02:54.459 --> 02:56.751
Can I borrow that?

02:56.751 --> 02:59.000
(rattling)

03:01.125 --> 03:02.626
He wasn't.

03:02.626 --> 03:04.626
You didn't get a chance to look at him.

03:04.626 --> 03:05.667
- He's my type.

03:05.667 --> 03:06.876
- You're like my little sister,

03:06.876 --> 03:08.792
only she likes guys who look rich.

03:08.792 --> 03:13.000
Men in suits, really boring men in suits.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.792
- I want a rebel, like a
guy you meet at a protest,

03:14.792 --> 03:18.459
maybe the one holding
the Molotov cocktails.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.375
- You think guys that
look like that are rebels?

03:22.375 --> 03:25.584
That jerk and you probably
have no common ground.

03:25.584 --> 03:27.167
You're ready to fuck him
because of his jacket

03:27.167 --> 03:28.375
and his patches.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.292
So this little fuck over
there probably has some

03:30.292 --> 03:32.834
overprotective investment banker father

03:32.834 --> 03:35.501
and you would get bored of
him as soon as his clothes

03:35.501 --> 03:37.834
were lying on your floor and you'd realize

03:37.834 --> 03:41.834
he wasn't the little rebel
you were looking for.

03:42.709 --> 03:45.375
(intense music)

04:04.042 --> 04:05.042
- [Ezra] Do we need to talk about murder

04:05.042 --> 04:06.876
to get your attention?

04:07.876 --> 04:11.292
- What do you think I'm a fucking killer?

04:32.792 --> 04:33.792
- Really Cat?

04:33.792 --> 04:34.834
- It's fashion.

04:34.834 --> 04:36.209
Chill out.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.584
- More like fascism.

04:37.584 --> 04:38.584
- So what?

04:38.584 --> 04:40.417
Siouxie Sioux is punk.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.209
- Actually it's for Sophie Scholl.

04:43.209 --> 04:47.167
I swear I saw that daddy
in Schöneberg last week.

04:47.167 --> 04:50.834
But I don't know, they all look the same.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.334
- What were you doing in Schöneberg?

04:52.334 --> 04:54.501
- I was buying a strap-on.

04:56.334 --> 04:58.125
That neighborhood's really great, though.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.792
- Why, so you can check
out the leather daddies?

04:59.792 --> 05:01.667
- No, because it's one of
the oldest gay neighborhoods

05:01.667 --> 05:02.834
in the world.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.250
Christopher Isherwood wrote about it,

05:04.250 --> 05:07.375
the nightclub El Dorado since 1920s.

05:07.375 --> 05:10.959
The smell of poppers
floats down the sidewalk.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.375
Plus there's all these great sex shops.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.334
And you fags don't even know about it?

05:15.334 --> 05:17.792
- It always just seemed so far away.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.626
- True, but the hustler
bars are great.

05:20.626 --> 05:21.876
And what is it, Tuesday?

05:21.876 --> 05:23.834
Nothing else is going on.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.334
We should go, like, right now.

05:29.334 --> 05:32.334
(upbeat punk music)

05:41.167 --> 05:43.209
♫ She's a pretty girl but

05:43.209 --> 05:45.250
♫ She doesn't have a fucking clue

05:47.542 --> 05:49.959
♫ What to do

05:58.751 --> 06:00.501
- I mean, it was kinda funny.

06:00.501 --> 06:01.501
You wanna know what she said?

06:01.501 --> 06:03.167
- Who has something nice to say about me?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.751
- She said you were a Nazi
with a fag on either side.

06:05.751 --> 06:08.751
- Great, just like this fucking guy.

06:09.876 --> 06:11.292
- Let's go, guys.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.042
Hi man.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.626
- It's only for men now.

06:20.626 --> 06:21.834
- What?

06:21.834 --> 06:22.751
- Men only.

06:25.792 --> 06:27.042
- This is wack.

06:28.042 --> 06:29.459
This is misogyny.

06:30.918 --> 06:32.667
This is women-hating.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.667
This is sexism.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.083
- Hey, mens only.

06:39.209 --> 06:43.250
- This is the patriarchal
system out of fucking control.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.626
- Catherine, let's just--

06:45.626 --> 06:46.959
- No, forget it.

06:48.125 --> 06:48.959
Look.

06:50.292 --> 06:54.542
I'm more of a man than
any of these little fags.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.584
And I probably have a bigger dick, too.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.250
You wanna see it?

06:59.250 --> 07:02.501
(thumping dance music)

07:26.292 --> 07:30.292
- Everyone just always
talks about your titties.

07:40.417 --> 07:43.000
Now who's gonna touch my penis?

07:45.292 --> 07:48.375
Is that a schimpfwort?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.042
- Give it a few years.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.209
(laughing)

08:10.167 --> 08:14.334
- I get a little uncomfortable
everybody's staring at us.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.709
- Is it your boyfriend?

08:25.709 --> 08:26.709
- No.

08:26.709 --> 08:27.918
- No?

08:27.918 --> 08:28.751
- Fags.

08:38.042 --> 08:40.292
So how long have you
been working here for?

08:40.292 --> 08:41.292
- [Man] Two months.

08:41.292 --> 08:42.876
- [Catherine] Yeah?

08:45.751 --> 08:47.667
- Catherine's so crazy.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.000
- We are not gay.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.459
- Sure you are.

08:52.459 --> 08:53.709
What are you doing here?

08:53.709 --> 08:54.542
- Working.

08:54.542 --> 08:55.375
- Yeah?

08:55.375 --> 08:56.209
- Mm hmm.

08:56.209 --> 08:57.792
- Fags work too.

08:57.792 --> 08:58.792
Sometimes.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.918
- [Man] But what are you doing here?

09:00.918 --> 09:02.542
- I'm a whore too.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.125
I was practically born a whore.

09:06.834 --> 09:09.250
- [Man] Wanna see my wife?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.751
- Why would I want to see your wife?

09:11.751 --> 09:13.417
- Look, my daughter.

09:14.876 --> 09:15.918
- [Catherine] Nice.

09:15.918 --> 09:16.918
- Really nice.

09:16.918 --> 09:17.959
You have children?

09:17.959 --> 09:18.792
- No.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.626
- You want children?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.417
Nice perfume.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.417
Very fruity.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.334
- Hey.

09:34.167 --> 09:36.542
(whispers)

09:36.542 --> 09:37.375
- Yeah?

10:39.042 --> 10:40.501
- Okay, we're gonna leave.

10:40.501 --> 10:41.876
- You guys are leaving.

10:41.876 --> 10:42.876
- Yes.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.876
- Together?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.834
- [Catherine] Yes.

10:45.834 --> 10:48.334
- [Ezra] Are you sure?

10:48.334 --> 10:49.959
- Have a good night, okay?

10:49.959 --> 10:50.959
- Okay.

10:50.959 --> 10:52.459
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

11:14.584 --> 11:15.751
Hey.

11:15.751 --> 11:17.334
- Hi.

11:17.334 --> 11:18.751
- Can I get you a drink?

11:18.751 --> 11:21.000
- Sure, I'll take a Radler.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.542
- You from Berlin?

11:32.542 --> 11:34.375
- No, I'm from Russia.

11:36.751 --> 11:39.584
- Things are not so good
there for queers though, huh?

11:39.584 --> 11:41.375
- No, not so good.

11:41.375 --> 11:44.042
But probably not as bad as you think.

11:44.042 --> 11:46.584
- I mean I was so moved by
the whole Pussy Riot thing

11:46.584 --> 11:49.834
and that guy, danke shoen,
the guy that nailed his balls

11:49.834 --> 11:51.626
to the ground in front of the Kremlin,

11:51.626 --> 11:53.834
so fucking amazing, right?

12:02.417 --> 12:04.584
Do you wanna do some MDMA?

12:06.751 --> 12:09.000
(laughing)

12:11.250 --> 12:14.667
This is the bar they used to hang out in.

12:17.918 --> 12:19.501
I love David Bowie.

12:20.626 --> 12:22.542
I mean he's one of these
artists that like saw

12:22.542 --> 12:23.959
into the future.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.959
Do you know Jobriath and Klaus Nomi?

12:25.959 --> 12:26.792
So good.

12:27.626 --> 12:28.459
Do you want to go to the lake?

12:28.459 --> 12:29.292
- This weekend?

12:29.292 --> 12:31.334
- No, right now.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.375
- It's raining.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.876
- It'll be sunny by the time we get there.

12:34.876 --> 12:37.459
(mellow music)

12:40.834 --> 12:43.250
♫ I would love you to use me amuse me

12:43.250 --> 12:46.584
♫ I'm chained to your insanity

12:46.584 --> 12:49.501
♫ Any day you could buy me or tie me up

12:49.501 --> 12:52.584
♫ A slave to your perversity

12:52.584 --> 12:54.292
♫ Refuse me

12:54.292 --> 12:55.584

12:55.584 --> 12:59.501

13:07.918 --> 13:10.792
♫ Take me out

13:10.792 --> 13:13.250

13:15.250 --> 13:17.792
♫ You just amaze me and daze me

13:17.792 --> 13:21.167

♫ For your troubles I'm expedient

14:31.918 --> 14:33.709
- [Ezra] You don't want
to stay for breakfast?

14:33.709 --> 14:35.292
- Sorry, I must go.

14:37.417 --> 14:38.626
But thanks for last night.

14:38.626 --> 14:39.876
It was fun, no?

14:42.792 --> 14:44.834
- Can I see you again?

14:44.834 --> 14:46.667
- Yeah, I'll text you.

14:52.209 --> 14:53.042
- Asshole.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.709
- I'm gonna make a coffee, okay?

15:02.709 --> 15:03.709
Do you want one?

15:03.709 --> 15:05.167
- Whatever.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.209
- Well do you want one or not?

15:07.209 --> 15:10.083
- Whatever, I don't care.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.584
Yes, I want coffee, thank you.

15:30.542 --> 15:33.209
(phone ringing)

15:39.042 --> 15:39.876
- Hi.

15:40.792 --> 15:41.834
- Hey.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.792
You wanna come over for breakfast?

15:43.792 --> 15:44.918
- It's 4 p.m.

15:44.918 --> 15:47.292
Call it brunch and then you've got a deal.

15:47.292 --> 15:48.292
- Okay.

15:48.292 --> 15:50.167
I'm here, just come over whenever.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.083
- Okay bye.

15:57.792 --> 15:58.626
What?

15:58.626 --> 15:59.459
- Nothing.

16:02.459 --> 16:05.459
(child jabbering)

16:05.459 --> 16:09.125
- Okay, everyone move
over for the breeders.

16:10.792 --> 16:13.417
So we went to this party.

16:13.417 --> 16:15.209
Some like Roman nightclub.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.417
But then I got home and Jayne was pissed.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.584
We had to fuck in the bathroom

16:19.584 --> 16:21.501
because she locked the bedroom door.

16:21.501 --> 16:22.792
- Both of those guys.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.167
- Not really, one of
them couldn't get it up.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.292
- I bet I know which one.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.542
- I bet you don't.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.667
It was so awkward too
because you know how small

16:29.667 --> 16:30.959
my bathroom is.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.876
But you know it's like,
Jayne and I, we're supposed

16:35.876 --> 16:39.959
to be in this free, open
relationship but I think

16:42.501 --> 16:45.375
if she knew that there were two hookers

16:45.375 --> 16:49.542
in the bathroom with me she
would have flipped her shit.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.542
You know?

16:50.542 --> 16:54.709
She probably just assumed
it was some trendy dyke.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.167
- [Ezra] What do you see in her anyways?

17:02.167 --> 17:05.666
- She's like a midwest diner beauty queen.

17:07.917 --> 17:09.416
So how was your night?

17:09.416 --> 17:10.416
- It was alright.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.416
- Yeah?

17:11.416 --> 17:12.584
- It was good.

17:12.584 --> 17:14.876
How do you know after like
the first night with someone

17:14.876 --> 17:17.041
if there was a connection?

17:18.125 --> 17:21.291
- Well what do you mean by connection?

17:22.459 --> 17:25.459
- I mean like a romantic connection.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.083
- Romantic?

17:28.083 --> 17:29.667
- [Ezra] What, you don't
believe in romance?

17:29.667 --> 17:31.334
- I didn't say that.

17:33.417 --> 17:36.000
Did he make direct eye contact?

17:40.417 --> 17:41.584
- Hard to say.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.542
It was late.

17:45.626 --> 17:46.792
- I should go.

17:47.751 --> 17:49.876
So we'll see you at Görlitzer
Park on Friday?

17:49.876 --> 17:51.083
- Yeah, you mean tomorrow.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.417
- Is it the weekend already?

17:52.417 --> 17:55.083
Feels like I never have any
time to get any work done.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.083
Okay.

17:56.083 --> 17:56.918
Bye.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.167
We understand each other,
we love each other,

18:07.167 --> 18:09.417
we don't need to always
go over and remember

18:09.417 --> 18:10.542
these negative things.

18:10.542 --> 18:12.250
Think about three days ago
when we were having sex

18:12.250 --> 18:14.292
and it was so hot, you know what I mean?

18:14.292 --> 18:15.125
(whistling)

18:15.125 --> 18:15.959
What, you like that?

18:15.959 --> 18:16.792
- Yeah.

18:16.792 --> 18:17.584
- Hold on a second.

18:17.584 --> 18:18.459
What, you like this?

18:18.459 --> 18:19.501
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:19.501 --> 18:20.375
- Do you have a girlfriend at home?

18:20.375 --> 18:21.375
- No.
- No?

18:21.375 --> 18:22.584
- No, I really like what I see.

18:22.584 --> 18:23.417
- Yeah, okay, yeah, shut up.
(slaps)

18:23.417 --> 18:24.250
- Oh.

18:25.792 --> 18:28.501
- This fucking asshole.

18:28.501 --> 18:30.501
No, I don't know, just some guy, you know,

18:30.501 --> 18:32.501
they're just rude to me.

18:33.501 --> 18:37.083
I walk down this bridge every fucking day.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.584
Jayne, don't give it to me, okay?

18:39.584 --> 18:41.334
I didn't do anything.

18:43.334 --> 18:46.292
Why are you always so
nervous and so uptight?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.209
Like, look, I understand you, okay?

18:50.792 --> 18:52.209
I understand you.

18:53.876 --> 18:57.626
I think we're just, we're trying to work

18:57.626 --> 18:59.292
as emotional beings.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.501
And that we should just be
open to whomever or whatever

19:02.501 --> 19:05.751
comes across or enlightens our desires.

19:07.501 --> 19:09.876
All we can do is hope
that it's reciprocated.

19:09.876 --> 19:11.459
And with you it is.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.792
I reciprocate your love.

19:17.334 --> 19:18.167
What?

19:19.542 --> 19:23.542
- I can't do this
non-monogamous thing with you.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.167
- I love you.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.751
I do, I love you.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.834
I respect and care and love you, okay?

19:35.083 --> 19:36.542
(sultry music)

19:36.542 --> 19:37.792
Give me a kiss.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.501
- Oh, you ruined them.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.125
(laughing)

19:55.125 --> 19:56.209
Oh, it's wet.

20:22.751 --> 20:24.459
♫ All I really really really really really

20:24.459 --> 20:26.125
♫ Really really really want to see

20:26.125 --> 20:30.125
♫ Is a total eclipse of the sun

20:32.209 --> 20:33.626
♫ All I really really really really really

20:33.626 --> 20:35.751
♫ Really really really want to see

20:35.751 --> 20:39.751
♫ Is a total eclipse of the sun

20:53.334 --> 20:56.751
♫ Says everyone

20:56.751 --> 21:00.918
♫ Just the birds are silent with surprise

21:12.417 --> 21:14.667
(giggling)

21:21.709 --> 21:23.876
♫ All I really really really really really

21:23.876 --> 21:25.334
♫ Really really really want to see

21:25.334 --> 21:29.334
♫ Is a total eclipse of the sun

21:40.292 --> 21:42.876
(soft singing)

21:46.375 --> 21:50.125
(intensifying bagpipe music)

22:05.959 --> 22:08.375
- [Catherine] She was a
crazy Nazi sympathizer.

22:08.375 --> 22:09.375
- Uh huh.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.375
- She was British.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.375
- British, yes, I know her.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.375
- She was totally in love with--

22:12.375 --> 22:15.000
- Yeah yeah yeah, she
was a very arrogant lady.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
- [Catherine] Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.834
(speaking German)

22:22.250 --> 22:23.751
- Did you know that Bette
Midler bought all the parks

22:23.751 --> 22:25.542
in New York City?

22:25.542 --> 22:27.167
- She has so much money that every park

22:27.167 --> 22:29.000
is now a Bette Midler park.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.250
- I heard you stuck seven
hits of pussy up your acid.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.250
- Oh yeah.

22:34.250 --> 22:37.292
(laughing)

22:37.292 --> 22:39.083
On the seventh day I'm
like fucking wigging out

22:39.083 --> 22:42.125
because every day for seven
days I took a hit of acid

22:42.125 --> 22:46.209
and decided okay, this is the seventh day,

22:46.209 --> 22:48.417
I put seven in my vagina.

22:48.417 --> 22:51.083
But I had recently read
a shit-ton on Babylon,

22:51.083 --> 22:53.334
the Tower of Babylon, big phallus,

22:53.334 --> 22:56.250
and that's like how you can
control people with...

22:56.250 --> 22:58.667
(whispering)

23:01.792 --> 23:03.167
(laughing)

23:03.167 --> 23:07.584
It just works perfectly with
the concept of the muse,

23:07.584 --> 23:10.501
like musing each other
instead of using each other.

23:10.501 --> 23:14.209
And I developed that after
discovering that the internet

23:14.209 --> 23:17.709
was actually my vehicle of sending love,

23:17.709 --> 23:20.125
and I can send it through my vagina,

23:20.125 --> 23:22.751
which is now accessible to everyone.

23:22.751 --> 23:24.918
(singing)

23:31.125 --> 23:34.792
♫ A caged bird doesn't sing

23:36.250 --> 23:40.959
♫ But my wings have been clipped

23:40.959 --> 23:44.709
♫ And I couldn't see a thing

23:47.626 --> 23:51.459
♫ All I needed was protection

23:53.042 --> 23:57.209
♫ And you were right there for me

23:59.334 --> 24:02.834
♫ Your love got me lifted

24:05.125 --> 24:08.209
♫ So high in the sky

24:10.876 --> 24:13.125
♫ I'm free

24:14.667 --> 24:16.751
♫ To fly

24:19.959 --> 24:23.209
'Cause it's just be shamed for so long.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.083
♫ I'm free to fly

24:30.250 --> 24:33.417
♫ Finally free to fly

24:36.667 --> 24:39.501
♫ I'm free to fly

24:41.459 --> 24:44.375
(audio distorting)

25:14.167 --> 25:17.250
(intensifying music)

26:19.667 --> 26:22.459
(murmurs and shouting from crowd)

26:22.459 --> 26:25.209
(sirens blaring)

26:39.209 --> 26:40.876
- She came 'cause she
was having a threesome

26:40.876 --> 26:42.334
with my flatmate Nick and his girlfriend.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.167
- Really?

26:43.167 --> 26:44.000
- Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.667
And like we met her and
there was just like screaming

26:45.667 --> 26:46.667
outside when we were walking.

26:46.667 --> 26:47.667
- And then when did?

26:47.667 --> 26:49.667
- Yeah it was just like
screaming from outside

26:49.667 --> 26:51.000
of the building, and we go inside

26:51.000 --> 26:53.334
and this like gazelle-looking
woman come out and it's her.

26:53.334 --> 26:54.167
- Wow.

26:54.167 --> 26:55.000
- Yeah.

26:55.000 --> 26:55.834
- I like that.

26:55.834 --> 26:56.667
- Yeah.

26:56.667 --> 26:57.501
That's how we met.

26:57.501 --> 26:59.167
- I wanna look like a gazelle.

26:59.167 --> 27:00.417
- Maybe you do.

27:01.292 --> 27:02.959
- Good.

27:02.959 --> 27:05.209
But I feel more like a horse.

27:05.209 --> 27:07.876
- But you look more
like a beautiful horse.

27:07.876 --> 27:08.876
- Okay.

27:08.876 --> 27:10.709
schöne pferde

27:10.709 --> 27:12.375
- No, not in German.

27:12.375 --> 27:14.167
(laughing)

27:14.167 --> 27:15.959
- [Ezra] That blonde boy
inside's pretty cute.

27:15.959 --> 27:17.375
- [Catherine] I thought you were over

27:17.375 --> 27:20.459
your leftist straight boy fetish.

27:20.459 --> 27:23.542
(bright dance music)

27:34.292 --> 27:37.876
♫ You loved a nation

27:37.876 --> 27:41.417
♫ Declare your need

27:41.417 --> 27:44.542
♫ You sweep my floor

27:44.542 --> 27:47.459
♫ Love that you do

28:23.083 --> 28:26.417
(shouting in megaphone)

28:33.167 --> 28:35.918
(haunting music)

28:54.626 --> 28:57.542
(thunder rumbling)

28:58.584 --> 29:00.125
- So.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.292
Tell me more about Africa.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.375
- I lived there until I was 10

29:05.375 --> 29:09.125
and I had my own horse and
I had my own little cheetah.

29:09.125 --> 29:10.125
- Really?

29:10.125 --> 29:11.125
You had a cheetah?

29:11.125 --> 29:13.542
- Yes, and it stayed with us.

29:15.209 --> 29:16.542
- Hey Sasha.

29:16.542 --> 29:18.000
- Hi.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.417
- How's it going?

29:19.417 --> 29:21.626
- I'm drinking with a friend.

29:21.626 --> 29:22.834
Let's talk later.

29:22.834 --> 29:23.667
- Okay.

29:39.709 --> 29:41.459
- So, you want to go?

29:42.501 --> 29:44.584
- [Man] Yes, let's do it.

30:04.626 --> 30:07.876
♫ It's all still there

30:10.083 --> 30:13.334
♫ Where goes the night

30:16.501 --> 30:19.000
♫ Our summers

30:20.250 --> 30:23.000
♫ Play on repeat

30:23.918 --> 30:27.167
♫ Where goes the night

30:30.918 --> 30:34.125
♫ In stealth

30:34.125 --> 30:36.792
♫ Stands a kiss

30:37.709 --> 30:40.959
♫ From an ancient time

30:44.542 --> 30:48.125
♫ The conquers gone unseen

30:49.083 --> 30:50.209
- So you're still here?

30:50.209 --> 30:52.709
- Yeah, I was waiting for you.

30:54.334 --> 30:55.501
- I'm working.

30:55.501 --> 30:56.667
- Can we talk?

30:58.542 --> 30:59.792
- What do you want to talk?

30:59.792 --> 31:00.792
I'm working.

31:08.375 --> 31:11.334
Okay look I can be done in a couple hours.

31:11.334 --> 31:13.417
Will you still be around?

31:14.501 --> 31:16.501
- Yeah, I can come back.

31:43.083 --> 31:45.292
- [Sasha] The guys at the bar can't know.

31:45.292 --> 31:47.125
- [Ezra] What are you talking about?

31:47.125 --> 31:48.709
- Look if we are going to be friends

31:48.709 --> 31:50.876
you cannot come to my work.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.375
You understand?

31:52.375 --> 31:53.209
- Okay.

32:22.792 --> 32:26.042
- My friend kicked me out of his house.

32:29.751 --> 32:32.000
- So where are you staying?

32:33.501 --> 32:34.501
- The hotel.

32:37.542 --> 32:39.918
- [Ezra] And how are you affording that?

32:39.918 --> 32:40.918
- Work more.

32:45.501 --> 32:46.918
- If you want you could
just go to my house

32:46.918 --> 32:50.417
and pass out or whatever, listen to music.

32:51.626 --> 32:52.459
- Okay.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.209
I'm tired.

32:56.167 --> 32:58.834
(Skype ringing)

33:07.375 --> 33:10.501
- Good, everything's good,
it's good to see you guys.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.792
- Mom, you have nothing to worry about.

33:24.918 --> 33:26.792
- Yeah, I think a visit's
like a really good idea,

33:26.792 --> 33:28.792
you guys'll have a really great time here.

33:28.792 --> 33:31.125
But right now I actually
have to go, it's really good

33:31.125 --> 33:32.667
to see you guys, okay?

33:34.042 --> 33:34.876
Bye.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.375
(chuckles)

33:39.584 --> 33:42.459
- Your parents sound nice.

33:42.459 --> 33:45.959
(mellow electronic music)

34:08.417 --> 34:10.458
- Did you hear that some
neo Nazis raided QB?

34:10.458 --> 34:12.000
- Bastards.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Are they okay?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.667
- Those classless brutes
should have some respect

34:14.667 --> 34:16.626
for Berlin culture.

34:16.626 --> 34:20.792
- I hope that all the dykes
kicked the shit out of them.

34:26.751 --> 34:28.542
- Since when did all these
Scandinavian artsy types

34:28.542 --> 34:29.708
become so gay?

34:32.167 --> 34:33.626
And they must have come
along with all the British

34:33.626 --> 34:36.417
dotcommers, right Conner?

34:36.417 --> 34:39.250
- I'm not even British, Catherine.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.583
- So why did you move to Berlin?

34:46.583 --> 34:48.292
- Because you know at the
end of Liquid Sky the movie

34:48.292 --> 34:51.958
the two lesbians ditch
Manhattan for Berlin.

34:53.208 --> 34:56.292
Otto knows what I'm talking about.

34:56.292 --> 34:57.709
- Ezra, don't you think we already have

34:57.709 --> 34:59.292
too many Canadians in town?

34:59.292 --> 35:01.209
- I like the Canadians.

35:03.751 --> 35:05.375
- What's your background?

35:05.375 --> 35:08.542
- My mom's from Palestine, my
dad's an Israeli German Jew.

35:08.542 --> 35:09.542
- You decided to come to Germany

35:09.542 --> 35:11.876
instead of go to the Middle East?

35:11.876 --> 35:14.292
- He wanted to indulge in his white roots.

35:14.292 --> 35:15.876
Not his brown ones.

36:29.334 --> 36:30.334
- Thank you.

36:38.584 --> 36:39.501
- You okay?

36:40.959 --> 36:41.792
- Yeah.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.375
It's my friend.

36:45.375 --> 36:47.584
He won't let me come pick my things.

36:47.584 --> 36:49.125
- Why not?

36:49.125 --> 36:51.292
- I don't know, he is mad.

36:52.584 --> 36:55.250
- Wanna go get something to eat?

36:56.459 --> 36:58.542
- I don't have any money.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.876
You don't have to go to work all week?

37:03.876 --> 37:04.709
- No.

37:06.292 --> 37:08.876
(upbeat music)

37:09.876 --> 37:11.417
(laughing)

37:11.417 --> 37:13.834
(chattering)

37:24.792 --> 37:25.792
- Mo?

37:25.792 --> 37:26.792
- Mole.

37:26.792 --> 37:27.876
- Mole!

37:27.876 --> 37:29.751
- Mole McHenry, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

37:29.751 --> 37:34.042
- Oh my god I will never be
able to adopt an Asian child.

37:34.042 --> 37:36.459
- I don't know, some people,
I just don't get their vibe.

37:36.459 --> 37:39.584
And it's kinda a creepy vibe.

37:39.584 --> 37:42.584
And it happens once every 20 people.

37:44.792 --> 37:47.042
And it's not about how they look.

37:47.042 --> 37:48.042
- Is that Ezra's?

37:48.042 --> 37:49.209
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:50.417 --> 37:52.042
- 'Cause we need an
office space but we can't

37:52.042 --> 37:54.959
find an office space 'cause
no one has an office job.

37:54.959 --> 37:57.000
- No, she was really nice, she's funny.

37:57.000 --> 37:57.834
She's got a kind of--
- Yeah.

37:57.834 --> 37:59.751

38:03.167 --> 38:04.083

- Hi.

38:06.292 --> 38:08.542
It's more Catherine's friends,
I mean there's some people

38:08.542 --> 38:12.125
and girlfriends and
stuff but I don't know.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.501
- I'm really glad I can't
speak German sometimes.

38:17.501 --> 38:19.751

38:29.959 --> 38:32.083

38:32.083 --> 38:35.709
- I love the way she says
that though, when ya fuck her.

38:35.709 --> 38:36.709
How does this guy fuck her?

38:36.709 --> 38:38.375
He fucks her.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.417
I fuck her.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.959
Fuck her.

don't be upset, don't be upset!

38:57.918 --> 38:59.834
I love you, I love you!

39:31.834 --> 39:33.334
- [Jayne] You'll wanna
be here with everybody

39:33.334 --> 39:35.125
and you'll stay all
night and you'll end up

39:35.125 --> 39:36.292

39:36.292 --> 39:37.834
- And then be like no get

you're totally unconscious.

42:05.459 --> 42:06.459

42:06.459 --> 42:08.042
- [Sasha] American.

42:08.042 --> 42:09.167
- On vacation?

42:09.167 --> 42:10.834

- No.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.250
- Works?

42:16.250 --> 42:17.667

42:19.334 --> 42:21.667

- I don't know.

42:22.792 --> 42:23.959
He likes here.

42:27.250 --> 42:30.584

Americans to move to Europe.

42:30.584 --> 42:33.667
I think all the people
want to go to America.

to her being a real woman

It's very, very difficult

48:33.792 --> 48:36.209

48:36.209 --> 48:37.626
It will be a lot of money.

48:37.626 --> 48:40.250
- I can imagine someone like
Gregg Araki directing it.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.542
- Yeah, we'll see, you
know, but first you have to

48:42.542 --> 48:44.125
write the book.

48:44.125 --> 48:48.125
I hear you are all over the
sex clubs and don't write.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.459

with a character that's trans.

48:55.667 --> 48:56.626
- Transvestite?

48:56.626 --> 48:57.834
- Transgender.

48:58.751 --> 49:00.334
- That's not commercial, you know.

49:00.334 --> 49:02.042
I think what's commercial
is I have an idea.

49:02.042 --> 49:04.959
I just read in the newspaper
there is a gay penguin couple

49:04.959 --> 49:06.792
who stole an egg from
a heterosexual couple

49:06.792 --> 49:11.417
and old people like to
see these kind of films.

49:11.417 --> 49:13.250
But first you have to write the book.

49:13.250 --> 49:15.501
Get up very early in the
morning, I mean good writers

49:15.501 --> 49:17.292
get up at four o'clock in the morning,

49:17.292 --> 49:21.959
write until late evening,
and don't sleep, you know.

49:46.542 --> 49:49.000
- Uh, aren't you a little old for this?

49:49.000 --> 49:50.959
Shouldn't you be at a dinner party?

49:50.959 --> 49:52.167
Or in bed?

49:52.167 --> 49:53.751
- You're my dinner.

49:55.501 --> 49:57.459
I'm gonna poke my heels through
that twink's eye socket if

49:57.459 --> 49:59.209
he says another word.

50:25.501 --> 50:26.459
- So what do you want?

50:26.459 --> 50:27.584
- I'll just take some MDMA.

50:27.584 --> 50:28.667
- Okay, sure.

50:31.083 --> 50:34.250
Oh wait, I think I only
got pills, is that okay?

50:34.250 --> 50:35.375
- Yeah, we'll take two.

50:35.375 --> 50:36.375
- Okay.

50:36.375 --> 50:37.792
- Oh, I mean they're super strong

50:37.792 --> 50:39.792
so I would say like
one is probably enough,

50:39.792 --> 50:42.334
definitely enough for
two like if you split it.

50:42.334 --> 50:43.334
- Okay.

50:43.334 --> 50:44.334
We'll take one then.

50:44.334 --> 50:45.584
- Oh, do you want mushrooms, too?

50:45.584 --> 50:46.709
- No thanks.

50:46.709 --> 50:48.209
- Okay, hey, then take this one,

50:48.209 --> 50:49.626
that's a present from me.

50:49.626 --> 50:52.334
I loved your last book,
by the way, it was so.

What was it called?

50:56.167 --> 50:57.250
Mainstream...

50:57.250 --> 50:58.417

white wine like classy lady.

58:07.209 --> 58:08.250

two white wines please?

have this beautiful red,

58:40.375 --> 58:44.459

so intensive I am still

58:45.876 --> 58:48.375
washing out the stains.

58:48.375 --> 58:49.709
Out of my dress.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.918
- [Sasha] So sometimes
you go out not in drag.

58:53.918 --> 58:57.000
- Sasha, look at me, and look at him.

58:58.167 --> 59:01.501
Can you believe that I will be like him?

59:03.125 --> 59:04.792
Never, never, never.

59:07.167 --> 59:08.918
It's my biggest fear.

keys for the ladies' room?

59:29.834 --> 59:33.042
- And you will spend a
lot of money on makeup.

59:33.042 --> 59:34.042
- Yes.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:30.250

01:00:32.918 --> 01:00:34.250

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.167
He's a boy.

01:00:37.584 --> 01:00:42.584
We met when I was fucking
a go-go dancer in the back.

01:00:42.584 --> 01:00:44.918
- How long have you guys been together?

01:00:44.918 --> 01:00:46.709
- Two years.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:50.125
We live together, but I'm not gay.

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:51.626
- You are not gay?

01:00:52.459 --> 01:00:54.042
- I'm not a faggot.

01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:01.250
I love Lukas.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:04.751
He is the best thing
that has happened to me.

01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:07.083
There was this woman before.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.709
She even bought me a car.

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:14.250
But I left her, I came to Berlin.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:15.918
Then here I met him.

01:01:20.709 --> 01:01:22.167
You know, sometimes it's
hard to live together

01:01:22.167 --> 01:01:25.375
with someone, to share everything.

01:01:25.375 --> 01:01:27.042
He is a mess.

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:31.209
He won't cook, won't clean,
won't do shit at home.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:33.167
I do all of it.

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:37.250
I make it nice for us, I
take care of everything.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.751
But it's worth it.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:47.542
Makes me happy in the morning
to wake up by his side.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.584
(dreamy music)

01:03:06.459 --> 01:03:08.459
(slaps)

01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:19.667
(bird cawing)

01:04:17.876 --> 01:04:19.167
- Hello.

01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:22.000
(speaking foreign language)

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.584
- Can you give me some advice?

01:04:23.584 --> 01:04:25.751
- Somebody on the street will ask you,

01:04:25.751 --> 01:04:27.834
"But you are a man!

01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:30.125
"Why do you dress like that?"

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:31.876
Then they always say well I'm in the same

01:04:31.876 --> 01:04:35.626
(speaking foreign language).

01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:40.209
♫ Don't be a bitter lemon

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.459

♫ Singing louder is what they fear

♫ You shouldn't be to trusting

♫ Those who are disgusting

01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:55.250
♫ Lying to your face

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:56.876
♫ What a disgrace

01:04:56.876 --> 01:04:59.709
God gave me the authority

amazing future.

01:05:01.959 --> 01:05:03.501
Tee hee hee.

01:05:03.501 --> 01:05:04.501
- Do you think I should--

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:07.417
- You were ready the moment you were born.

01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:09.667

(dreamy music)

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.000
- These are my friends.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:41.626
- Hello.

01:05:41.626 --> 01:05:42.876
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:44.542
- [All] Hi, welcome.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:48.792
- Cheers darling, you look fabulous.

01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:51.709
(glasses clinking)

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:58.542
- The trans mitzvah.

01:06:00.459 --> 01:06:01.667
- To Sasha.

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.083
- [All] To Sasha!

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:08.667
- I guess the best experience
I had in my transition

01:06:08.667 --> 01:06:11.542
was I once had a friend
who made a picture of me

01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:14.751
and showed it to me,
just like a normal friend

01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:16.209
would show you a picture,

01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:18.959
and was the first time
in my life when I was

01:06:18.959 --> 01:06:23.125
able to see my face and
see that finally it was me.

01:06:25.042 --> 01:06:28.459
And it's very difficult
to describe that after

01:06:28.459 --> 01:06:31.959
20 something years or
let's say 18, (laughing)

01:06:31.959 --> 01:06:36.000
you were not able to
recognize 100% yourself

01:06:39.209 --> 01:06:42.375
from your face, which I did this time.

01:06:43.334 --> 01:06:46.000
So it took me 20
something years to realize

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.918
that I was this person.

01:06:48.959 --> 01:06:50.709
That I exist.

01:06:50.709 --> 01:06:54.167
- Since people started to
see me as a male person

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:56.709
I could finally live the way I wanted to

01:06:56.709 --> 01:06:59.209
and finally have sex the way I wanted to

01:06:59.209 --> 01:07:01.125
because before it was
like for me being put

01:07:01.125 --> 01:07:03.876
in this position of being a
woman, having sex with men,

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:05.250
it was just awkward.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.918
- I've always been a woman.

01:07:06.918 --> 01:07:10.459
The thing is that people
think I'd be a man

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:11.876
'cause I'm such a butch.

01:07:11.876 --> 01:07:12.709
- Exactly.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:13.542
(laughing)

01:07:13.542 --> 01:07:15.000
- And I look like a boy a bit.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.125
But I've always been a woman,
I didn't know it earlier,

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:21.751
and I really thought I'd be
a man and I lived like that.

01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:24.417
- Trans women friends
always told me guys like me

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:26.709
don't exist, there's
only them, but one day

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.459
I found out about hormones.

01:07:28.459 --> 01:07:31.125
- Oh.
(laughing)

01:07:32.167 --> 01:07:35.584
- Speaking of hormones.
(laughing)

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:38.918
Some of us don't even have them anymore.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.667
- An older brother and I
was like he's got something

01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:46.584
in between his legs which would
grow probably a little bit

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.876
later to me as well and
I was laying in bed like,

01:07:48.876 --> 01:07:51.709
dear god, and tomorrow
I'm gonna have a penis.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:55.709
And this is how I actually
thought it works, to be.

01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:56.709
- Just pray enough.

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:58.083
- Yeah.

01:07:58.083 --> 01:08:03.000
- Pray hard enough and you
become what you really are.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.042
- Every day is a fight
but not just for us,

01:08:05.042 --> 01:08:08.125
for everybody living life is a fight.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:10.876
So you don't have to be
trans or something in between

01:08:10.876 --> 01:08:11.709
to fight.

01:08:12.584 --> 01:08:14.876
- Some people, when I say I'm
trans they don't believe it.

01:08:14.876 --> 01:08:17.834
I got to get naked or to show my scars.

01:08:17.834 --> 01:08:21.667
So by getting naked on stage
it's a way to show people

01:08:21.667 --> 01:08:25.334
that there are a lot of
different bodies and gender

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.209
and that I am one of them

01:08:27.209 --> 01:08:30.501
and that they would have
not known if I would not

01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:33.542
have shown that so it's like
a way for me to be really

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.917
myself and at the same
time playing a character

01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:37.459
so it's really fun.

01:08:37.459 --> 01:08:38.876
You should really do that.

01:08:38.876 --> 01:08:40.125
- Yes, totally.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.667
- Okay, we perform together.

01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:44.042
(laughing)

01:08:44.042 --> 01:08:45.250
- And sometimes we have also sex on stage

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:47.375
and yeah it's fun and cool,

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:48.542
you have to try it out.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:52.125
- Nothing you can do but
just follow your dreams.

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:54.375
(cheering)

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.417
(pulsing electronic dance music)

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:03.417
(singing in German)

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:15.584
♫ Either way the guys get outta hand

01:09:44.501 --> 01:09:46.751
(cheering)

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:52.876
♫ But that just passes by

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:04.918
(cheering)

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:15.751
- I loved it, thank you.

01:10:15.751 --> 01:10:16.918
- Here she is.

01:10:17.792 --> 01:10:19.417
- Hey.

01:10:19.417 --> 01:10:20.501
- Oh hey.

01:10:20.501 --> 01:10:22.167
Yeah, right on, kid.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.834
(dreamy music)

01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:33.834
- [Woman] Often cultural capital

01:10:33.834 --> 01:10:36.167
comes from economic capital.

01:10:37.417 --> 01:10:40.792
One thing transforms into the other.

01:10:40.792 --> 01:10:43.918
- [Sasha] I like writing
these poems and pictures.

01:10:43.918 --> 01:10:46.000
Sometimes they are songs.

01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:51.292
- [Ezra] You're a
hustler, you're a problem.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.209
And in Russia?

01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:57.125
- [Sasha] In my hometown
living with my mother.

01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:59.626
Sometimes I feel like a woman.

01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:06.375
I don't know.

01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:09.501
Humans just very complicated.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:12.584
- [Man] Actually, think
he came out as trans.

01:11:12.584 --> 01:11:14.918
(speaking foreign language)

01:11:14.918 --> 01:11:16.792
- [Woman] My parents took
it harder when I came out

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:20.375
as an artist than when
I came out as queer.

01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:22.751
- [Woman] Are you nervous?

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:24.334
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:34.584
- Let's just do one more, yeah?

01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:38.083
(cheery piano music)

01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:38.918
Fuck.

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:43.375
This feels really weird to me in here.

01:11:43.375 --> 01:11:44.959
- Why?

01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:46.375
You think he's gonna bomb?

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:47.459
- I hope not.

01:11:48.459 --> 01:11:51.459
(singing in German)

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.584
- Hurry up, you're gonna miss him.

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:17.042
(sniffing)

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:22.501
You have some cum on your face.

01:12:24.834 --> 01:12:26.709
Give that to me.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:29.250
This place is fucking so small.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.501
(sniffing)

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:47.959
(applauding)

01:12:47.959 --> 01:12:48.959
- Is that applause?

01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:50.292
Did we miss it?

01:12:50.292 --> 01:12:52.751
- Don't worry, there's gonna be an encore.

01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:53.584
Let's go.

01:13:18.334 --> 01:13:21.834
(upbeat electronic music)

01:13:50.375 --> 01:13:51.209
- Hey.

01:13:51.209 --> 01:13:52.042
- Hi.

01:13:52.042 --> 01:13:53.751
- Good to see you.

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:54.709
- You too.

01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:55.626
How was it?

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:57.918
- It was good.

01:13:57.918 --> 01:13:58.918
Did you miss?

01:13:58.918 --> 01:13:59.959
- Yeah, I just ran and got a coffee.

01:13:59.959 --> 01:14:03.125
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:04.375
- Oh, you got a coffee.

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:05.709
- I should have gotten you one, I'm sorry.

01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:08.167
- No, it's fine, I'm okay.

01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:09.000
Thank you.

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.501
I see an old friend of mine over there.

01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:17.751
I think I will just go
and say hi, is it okay?

01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:19.751
- Okay, yeah, we can just meet later.

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:20.918
- Okay, it's good.

01:14:20.918 --> 01:14:22.250
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

01:14:25.334 --> 01:14:27.918
(dreamy music)

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.250
Hey, Alexander.

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:36.751
- Sasha.

01:14:36.751 --> 01:14:37.584
- Hey.

01:14:38.667 --> 01:14:40.167
- Hey.

01:14:40.167 --> 01:14:41.334
How is it going?

01:14:41.334 --> 01:14:42.334
- Good.

01:14:42.334 --> 01:14:43.417
- Come, take a seat.

01:14:43.417 --> 01:14:44.584
- How are you?

01:14:46.542 --> 01:14:47.626
- Yeah, fine.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:50.667
Bad guys have more fun.

01:14:52.209 --> 01:14:53.042
- Yes.

01:14:54.334 --> 01:14:56.459
- And, what do you make here?

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.292
- I was in a meeting.

01:14:58.292 --> 01:14:59.375
- Yeah?
- Yes.

01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:03.167
- What's that called again?

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:04.167
- DOM.

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.167
- DOM.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.167
- Yeah.

01:15:06.167 --> 01:15:07.167
They are very good.

01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:09.000
- Yeah yeah.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.209
The gay Russian community in Germany.

01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:12.417
- Yeah, you should come.

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:14.626
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

01:15:14.626 --> 01:15:16.459
But sorry, not for me.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.125
- Yeah I was thinking of going to Moscow,

01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:25.876
help with the gay pride parade.

01:15:25.876 --> 01:15:27.209
- Are you crazy?

01:15:29.334 --> 01:15:32.083
They will fuck you up over there.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.751
Sasha, you were lucky
enough to make it here,

01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:36.000
why the hell would you go back?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.042
- It's important.

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:38.501
- Ah, this is crazy.

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:39.501
- I have to.

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:48.584
- Come get changed and
let's go for a drink, I pay.

01:15:48.584 --> 01:15:49.417
- Changed?

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:53.459
- Yeah.

01:15:53.459 --> 01:15:55.042
- Thanks, I'm fine.

01:15:58.209 --> 01:15:59.626
Say hi to Maxime.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:11.501
- Would you love me more
if I bought an apartment?

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:13.751
A fancy apartment?

01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:14.751
- We'll see.

01:16:14.751 --> 01:16:17.375
- What do you mean, we'll see?

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:21.459
What about if it had like
a moving camera butler.

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.667
- Be firm in affairs of the heart.

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:27.209
Don't let the past distract the present.

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:30.125
This is an excellent time
to start a new love affair,

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:32.209
new vows, or to relocate.

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:36.959
So what could relocation mean like?

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.792
- Have you guys been to Paris?

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:40.584
You would love it, all the cupcakes--

01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:42.125
(laughing)

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.709
- It's a romantic city
but I wish I spoke French,

01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:45.167
I don't speak French at all

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.959
so I was like "Bonjour,"
and they look at me

01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:48.209
and they're like, "Hello."

01:16:48.209 --> 01:16:49.751
(laughing)

01:16:49.751 --> 01:16:50.959
Like am I that American?

01:16:50.959 --> 01:16:52.334
Apparently so.

01:16:52.334 --> 01:16:54.876
- I was going to go to
Ibiza when I was DJing.

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.584
- Yeah, I love Spain.

01:16:56.584 --> 01:16:59.792
Any excuse to go to Ibiza,
any excuse to go to Spain,

01:16:59.792 --> 01:17:00.792
I'm there.

01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:03.375
(laughing)

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:04.959
- Cupcakes and men.

01:17:08.334 --> 01:17:11.125
- The tea is pink, it matches
the cupcakes, you're insane.

01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:13.083
That is incredible.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.792
- It's sinful, you know,
all these hip openers.

01:17:14.792 --> 01:17:15.626
- Hips, hips.

01:17:15.626 --> 01:17:17.876
(laughing)

01:17:22.584 --> 01:17:24.918
I mean I love cupcakes and yoga.

01:17:24.918 --> 01:17:26.042
(laughing)

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.375
This is my life.

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:32.959
- [Woman] Well you do yoga
so you can eat the cupcakes.

01:17:32.959 --> 01:17:36.167
- As much as I love sex,
I love food more, sorry.

01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:38.417
(laughing)

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:45.501
- I'm sorry but at what time should we go?

01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:47.250
- Oh, yeah, we should probably--

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.792
- I think we.

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:50.834
- [Jayne] I'm sorry, we gotta go.

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:53.042
Thank you so much for
the lovely (mumbles).

01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:54.167
- [Sasha] Oh, thank you so much.

01:17:54.167 --> 01:17:55.667
- Is this one of the mango ones?

01:17:55.667 --> 01:17:56.667
It's like orange.

01:17:56.667 --> 01:17:57.501
- [Woman] You both got mango.

01:17:57.501 --> 01:17:59.167
- Thank you so much.

01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.042
- Ciao!

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:02.876
- Cheers!

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:06.918
- [Host] God, they are so cute
together, don't you think?

01:18:06.918 --> 01:18:08.250
- [Woman] Are they together, together?

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.417
- I don't know.

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:11.542
- [Woman] What's his name now?

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.542
- [Woman] Well I hope so because
Catherine was such a bitch.

01:18:13.542 --> 01:18:14.542
- I know.

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:15.792
I think so too!

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.042
Think they're having sex now?

01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:20.209
- Like now?

01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:21.959
- That would be so hot.

01:18:21.959 --> 01:18:24.209
(laughing)

01:19:27.918 --> 01:19:29.918
- Instead he arrived
here, overstayed his visa,

01:19:29.918 --> 01:19:32.417
and now it's impossible for
me to give him permission

01:19:32.417 --> 01:19:34.417
to stay here any longer.

01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:37.042
- I mean, can you help us?

01:19:37.042 --> 01:19:38.959
Is there something we can do to fix this?

01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:41.709
- The question is what
should you have done before.

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:45.667
I mean you cannot just arrive
in a foreign country and--

01:19:45.667 --> 01:19:47.751
- There's gotta be something
that you can do for us.

01:19:47.751 --> 01:19:48.751
- I'm sorry.

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:51.792
He should have thought about it earlier.

01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:52.959
What can I do?

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:56.375
- [Jayne] Okay.

01:20:01.959 --> 01:20:03.876
- [Official] Good luck.

01:20:12.292 --> 01:20:14.542
(laughing)

01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:17.334
- No!

01:20:19.834 --> 01:20:21.709
- Oh, wait a second, wait a second.

01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:23.542
I heard about this.

01:20:23.542 --> 01:20:24.751
Do you guys want to go?

01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:26.667
- Mentor to Young Perverts.

01:20:26.667 --> 01:20:29.209
- Oh, I know this guy.

01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:30.834
He moved to Berlin a couple of years ago

01:20:30.834 --> 01:20:33.834
and in this particular
book he mentioned everybody

01:20:33.834 --> 01:20:37.584
that he met that he knew
and put us all down.

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:40.375
He exploits us all.

01:20:41.792 --> 01:20:44.876
And I do not want to be part of that.

01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:49.125
I don't think we should
grace him with our presence.

01:20:49.125 --> 01:20:50.292
- Yeah, I don't think so.

01:20:50.292 --> 01:20:52.751
(laughing)

01:20:52.751 --> 01:20:53.792
- It's a great jacket.

01:20:53.792 --> 01:20:54.792
- Oh, thank you.

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:55.792
- Where'd you get that jacket?

01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:57.459
- Actually my sister gave it to me.

01:20:57.459 --> 01:20:58.459
- Your sister.

01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:00.626
- She stayed in Berlin?
- My sister.

01:21:00.626 --> 01:21:03.334
No, she was here visiting.

01:21:03.334 --> 01:21:05.584
- 'Cause this is kinda old school Berlin.

01:21:05.584 --> 01:21:07.542
This wasn't like she was
here like a year ago, right?

01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:10.834
- She didn't buy this
in Berlin, in London.

01:21:10.834 --> 01:21:13.417
- Can't believe no one showed up.

01:21:13.417 --> 01:21:15.083
The publishers did such a crap job

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:17.876
at promoting this event.

01:21:17.876 --> 01:21:20.000
They must have something against me.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.501
Racist bitches.

01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:23.250
- Can you just enjoy yourself?

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:25.459
You're like a little nervous chihuahua.

01:21:25.459 --> 01:21:27.626
You're such a drama queen.

01:21:28.751 --> 01:21:32.250
- I'd rather be a drama queen then a doll.

01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:38.250
- Did you read that New York
Times article about Berlin?

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:42.876
- [Man] Yes, and it's true,
Berlin, it's dead, it's over.

01:21:42.876 --> 01:21:44.083
It's not happening anymore.

01:21:44.083 --> 01:21:45.417
- [Man] It's not what it used to be.

01:21:45.417 --> 01:21:47.417
- Detroit, New Orleans.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:49.375
- I'm gonna buy a house in Bucharest.

01:21:49.375 --> 01:21:51.584
I think the idea of wild dogs
roaming around the streets

01:21:51.584 --> 01:21:53.000
is very romantic.

01:21:54.167 --> 01:21:55.417
- It is romantic.

01:21:55.417 --> 01:21:56.250
- Yeah.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:57.501
- I can see it.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:00.083
- Sasha.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.709
- Ezra.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:03.542
Hi.

01:22:05.292 --> 01:22:07.584
Congratulations on your new book.

01:22:07.584 --> 01:22:08.918
- [Ezra] Thanks.

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:12.834
- You look different.

01:22:12.834 --> 01:22:14.250
- Yeah?

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.667
I could hardly recognize you.

01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:22.042
Where are you going?

01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:25.000
- [Sasha] Just having a walk.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.167
- Can I come with?

01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:28.000
- Sure.

01:22:29.542 --> 01:22:32.292
(haunting music)

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:54.000
- Do you wanna stop and smoke a cigarette?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.834
- Sure.

01:23:11.459 --> 01:23:12.876
Thanks, I'm fine.

01:23:23.918 --> 01:23:27.501
- You were never
attracted to me, were you?

01:23:32.292 --> 01:23:33.792
You were using me.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.834
- Ezra.

01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:45.209
I liked you.

01:23:49.584 --> 01:23:51.501
- It's okay, it's fine.

01:24:13.292 --> 01:24:14.125
- Ezra.

01:24:32.542 --> 01:24:33.709
Ezra, stop it!

01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:02.959
(phone rings)

01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:03.792
- Hello.

01:25:04.959 --> 01:25:08.918
- Hey, Sasha, I got an advance on my book.

01:25:08.918 --> 01:25:10.751
Can I take you out to dinner?

01:25:14.083 --> 01:25:14.918
Jayne?

01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:17.292
- Ezra.

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:20.709
- Yeah, are you with Sasha?

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:22.626
- No, Sasha's not here.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:27.584
She had to go back to Russia.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:31.751
- But.

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:34.876
- Please don't ever call here again.

01:25:34.876 --> 01:25:35.709
Twat.

01:25:49.876 --> 01:25:52.542
(phone ringing)

01:26:07.459 --> 01:26:08.292
- Hi.

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:11.209
- Hey Cat.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:14.959
Wanna go out for some bloody marys?

01:26:18.083 --> 01:26:19.834
- Maybe just one.

01:26:19.834 --> 01:26:22.876
- [Ezra] Okay, I'm coming by.

01:26:22.876 --> 01:26:25.501
- [Woman] And maybe I can access you.

01:26:25.501 --> 01:26:29.167
Your birth, your youth, your
motherhood, your old age,

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:30.083
your death.

01:26:31.459 --> 01:26:34.125
I'm ripe to access you entirely.

01:26:37.584 --> 01:26:39.375
(laughing)

01:26:39.375 --> 01:26:41.459
♫ And I told you not to come

01:30:26.459 --> 01:30:29.167
♫ In my nightlife I don't think twice

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:32.542

01:30:39.292 --> 01:30:40.918
♫ Blinded by the headlights

01:30:40.918 --> 01:30:42.584
♫ Driving past midnight

01:30:42.584 --> 01:30:45.876
♫ Looks like a still life

01:30:45.876 --> 01:30:47.584
♫ Give me something cheap

01:30:47.584 --> 01:30:49.167
♫ Not enough sleep

01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:50.834
♫ Which one do I keep

01:30:50.834 --> 01:30:54.083
♫ You are my nightlife

01:31:06.417 --> 01:31:07.751
