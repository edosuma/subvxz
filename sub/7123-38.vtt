She was trying to eat
my insides,

09:59.599 --> 10:00.930
so I'm cooking her.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.934
I know that sounds crazy,
but I had no choice.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.163
I'm operating on my lowest
survival brain function

10:05.237 --> 10:06.898
right now.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.373
What?
Aah!

10:09.442 --> 10:11.774
- Chill, man!
- No, we got to book!

10:11.844 --> 10:13.573
Go!
- MARC Y: Go where, Jake?

10:13.646 --> 10:14.544
[Laughs]

10:14.614 --> 10:17.811
I got to suck out your insides
first, right?

10:17.883 --> 10:19.748
Ah, nay-nay, bro!

10:19.819 --> 10:21.013
Time to eat.

10:21.087 --> 10:21.985
[Rumbling]

10:22.054 --> 10:24.045
Huh?
What the...

10:26.792 --> 10:28.089
FINN:
Bubblegum?

10:28.160 --> 10:29.252
Hey, guys.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.989
I saw my seismograph had gone
off the charts,

10:31.063 --> 10:33.224
so I figured you
might be in trouble, right?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.494
Yeah, but watch out
for Marceline.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.160
She's gone rabid.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.796
What?
Marceline's gonna rap for me?

10:39.872 --> 10:40.861
Aah!

10:40.940 --> 10:43.807
[Both gasp]

10:43.876 --> 10:45.036
[Sighs]
Woof.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.510
Thanks, Bonnie.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.446
That's enough low-grade red to
get me home, at least.

10:49.515 --> 10:53.178
Come on, guys. Let's go.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.243
Are you all right, PB?

10:55.321 --> 10:58.154
Did you get
the spoon of prosperity?

10:58.224 --> 11:02.092
Yeah. Here you go.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.288
ALL:
Whoa!

11:04.363 --> 11:07.526
Peeps will never
starve in my eternal empire.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.297
Sand worm, up!

11:13.606 --> 11:17.633

11:17.710 --> 11:21.510
