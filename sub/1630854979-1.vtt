02:06.648 --> 02:08.954
When do I get to go?

02:08.954 --> 02:11.218
When you know
what you're looking at.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.133
Dad, I know.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.789
One 1,000, two 1,000, three--

02:17.789 --> 02:19.835
Less than a mile away.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.927
Here, put this on.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.195
You hear it?

02:34.066 --> 02:39.071
One day, your mom and I
are gonna build one for that.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.598
-  Are you ever scared?
-  Nah.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.165
When you do something you love,

02:45.165 --> 02:46.644
there's nothing
to be afraid of.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.170
<i>BWQ, it's time.</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:52.694
Bill, you better keep
your phone on this time.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.478
-  Hey, I mean it.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.089
Wait!

02:59.440 --> 03:01.181
Wait! Dad!

03:19.503 --> 03:21.418
<i>...all the way to the ground,</i>

03:21.418 --> 03:23.638
<i>but there's definite
strong rotation</i>

03:23.638 --> 03:25.335
<i>right in the middle
of that rain,</i>

03:25.335 --> 03:27.772
<i>and that's going to be
near I-40, just after I-40,</i>

03:27.772 --> 03:30.253
<i>or near and just be,
I would say,</i>

03:30.253 --> 03:32.516
<i>uh, the first Geary exit,</i>

03:32.516 --> 03:35.911
<i>the first, that would be
Highway 281 exit</i>

03:35.911 --> 03:37.913
<i>here from Geary exit,
Gary. Thank you.</i>

03:37.913 --> 03:39.610
<i>All right, you're watching</i>

03:39.610 --> 03:41.917
<i>the storm west on Highway 33</i>

03:41.917 --> 03:44.093
<i>west of Kingfisher tornado.</i>

03:44.093 --> 03:46.443
<i>These storms
continue to intensify</i>

03:46.443 --> 03:48.271
Will, don't play with
Mommy's things.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.664
<i>...developing and circulating</i>

03:49.664 --> 03:51.318
<i>the South Central
Garfield County</i>

03:51.318 --> 03:53.015
<i>around Southwest Kingfisher
needs to be watched.</i>

03:53.015 --> 03:55.104
<i>All these are cyclonic,
and there's another one</i>

03:55.104 --> 03:57.628
<i>just due south of Greenfield
moving northeast.</i>

03:57.628 --> 04:01.502
<i>- There's the one west
-</i> Where's Daddy headed?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.463
Hey, hey, hey.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.160
Hey, buddy.
We got two of them.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.381
We're gonna figure out some
kind of seating arrangement.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.776
Sorry, Mr. Brody.
I brought my classmate.
I hope that's all right.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.604
Your funeral.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.432
And you're in
Long Horn Country now.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.001
Everything's bigger in Texas.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.742
- Roy...
-  Yeah.

04:24.742 --> 04:28.006
Put Quinn's probes
in their trunk.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.834
You take the lead.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.009
You sure?

04:31.009 --> 04:32.446
I'll ride with these guys.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.320
-  All right, go ahead.
-  Yup.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.773
<i>...hundred miles an hour</i>

04:55.773 --> 04:58.472
<i>...still on the ground
to Southeast--</i>

04:58.472 --> 05:00.604
What do you mean
my student is driving?

05:00.604 --> 05:03.346
<i>We couldn't fit.</i>

05:03.346 --> 05:07.176
OU only covers our truck
and Bill as a driver.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.570
- Do you understand?
<i>- What do you want me to do?</i>

05:09.570 --> 05:11.136
<i>He's chasing the storm,
I'm chasing him.</i>

05:11.136 --> 05:12.703
Jesus.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.401
What's your twenty?

05:19.231 --> 05:20.972
<i>...you are not
gonna see them coming.</i>

05:20.972 --> 05:23.932
<i>You're gonna have to basically
be in the barricade to...</i>

05:23.932 --> 05:26.108
Tell my husband
to answer his phone.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.502
<i>MBQ, I wish
you could see this!</i>

05:28.502 --> 05:30.330
- Dad!
- <i>It's biblical!</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:31.809
<i>Looks like a grass fire,</i>

05:31.809 --> 05:33.507
<i>the way the dirt's
being pulled in.</i>

05:33.507 --> 05:35.596
<i>Being in a car in a tornado
is a really bad idea.</i>

05:35.596 --> 05:39.643
<i>-</i> Bill, you have a phone
for a reason!

05:39.643 --> 05:43.517
We are not pulling
another storm like Joplin.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.170
-  <i>It's just
to the south of us.</i>

05:45.170 --> 05:46.694
<i>We can get ahead of her,</i>

05:46.694 --> 05:50.175
<i>and I'd say she's closer
to Hallam, Nebraska.</i>

05:50.175 --> 05:51.481
<i>No, Bill. It's more like</i>

05:51.481 --> 05:53.091
<i>if Jarrell and Joplin
had a baby.</i>

05:53.091 --> 05:55.267
<i>Just pulling
huge volumes of air.</i>

05:55.267 --> 05:56.399
Now you listen here.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.270
Forty-four. Turn North.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.142
<i>Bill, let's do what she says.
Exit here.</i>

06:00.142 --> 06:01.796
<i></i> [Quinn] Forty-four.
Turn North.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.406
-  <i>Bill, let's end this!
-</i>

06:03.406 --> 06:04.886
- Bill.
-  <i>We can't
afford to lose it!</i>

06:04.886 --> 06:07.149
<i>- Go, go, go!
-</i> Bill.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.369
It's too wide.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.284
- Bill, north now.
-  <i>Stop!</i>

06:12.284 --> 06:13.634
<i>Bill, do you copy?</i>

06:13.634 --> 06:15.375
<i>Floor it.
She's cutting you off.</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:16.854
<i>- Floor it!</i>

06:16.854 --> 06:18.900
Bill.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.032
<i>It's the type of storm
that will kill you.</i>

06:21.032 --> 06:22.425
<i>-</i> Bill.
-  <i>We're looking to southwest...</i>

06:22.425 --> 06:24.079
Bill!

06:24.079 --> 06:25.863
<i>Tornado or not,
what I can tell you</i>

06:25.863 --> 06:29.258
<i>is the whole sky is
sitting on the ground</i>

06:29.258 --> 06:30.999
<i>and it Is just churning.</i>

06:41.879 --> 06:45.622
One 1,000, two 1,000 <i>...</i>

06:45.622 --> 06:48.277
three 1,000, four...

07:14.216 --> 07:17.045
<i>...red or burgundy red hair...</i>

07:19.961 --> 07:22.354
We found one kid
about 200 yards that way.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.139
We're still looking
for the other.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.709
He most likely
had his seatbelt on.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.170
I just mopped that.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.694
Yeah, I know.
We've gotta get going.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.999
We're gonna fall behind.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.384
You all done up here?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.702
What about the second load?

09:36.271 --> 09:37.838
I don't want her to see me here.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.667
Please, Mom.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.061
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.854
Are you wearing lipstick?

09:53.854 --> 09:56.596
What? No.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.249
I gotta get eggs
when we get home.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.468
Don't worry about it.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.603
- Now, I'm gonna be late.
- Ah, that's my boy.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.648
- Aye.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.519
Oh, great.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.304
You know it always
takes two tries.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.740
- There we go.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.220
Yeah.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.354
-  Don't do that.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.268
Oh, my God.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can...

13:11.268 --> 13:13.009
Okay, okay.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.750
Okay, class, don't forget,

13:14.750 --> 13:16.839
- thermodynamic packets
are due when?

13:16.839 --> 13:18.493
- End of the week, all right?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.190
If you guys
would like to procrastinate,

13:20.190 --> 13:21.539
I'II give you
four days to do this.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.150
- You started yet?
-  Come on.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.847
- Nearly done.
- Serious?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.980
- If you help me with mine,

13:26.980 --> 13:28.546
I'll give you
another driving lesson.

13:29.547 --> 13:30.722
Deal.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.376
William Brody,

13:32.376 --> 13:34.814
could you please escort
this officer to your locker?

13:43.126 --> 13:44.693
She asked for this.

13:44.693 --> 13:48.784
I don't even know
what she's looking for.

13:48.784 --> 13:51.700
Please stay seated until
Mr. Keaton's ready for you.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.834
Yes, he was in the office.
He was being sure.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.426
-  Hey!
- William Brody!

14:22.426 --> 14:24.341
Okay. Temperature conversion,

14:24.341 --> 14:26.909
it's in the packet,
it's important.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.215
Make sure that y--

14:33.698 --> 14:35.875
- What is that?
- It's Brody.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.529
- Yeah, that's him.
- Oh, my gosh.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.074
Does Brody think
he's Spider-Man?

15:14.391 --> 15:15.871
Why's he still up there?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.177
He's gonna
get hit by lightning.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.570
- Oh, my God. Is he doing--

15:24.358 --> 15:27.796
-  I told you he's crazy.
- He is so--

15:35.108 --> 15:37.066
So you thought
it would be a good idea

15:37.066 --> 15:39.112
to get up on the roof

15:39.112 --> 15:41.418
in the middle of a thunderstorm,

15:41.418 --> 15:44.465
turn this thing on
and see what happens?

15:44.465 --> 15:46.075
It's what Dad did.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.338
Dad didn't go to college.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.949
It's just a microphone.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.909
How would you know if it works?

15:53.909 --> 15:56.216
I'm not going to be
the reason you get expelled.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.827
College is your way out,
you understand?

15:58.827 --> 16:00.785
Do you understand?

16:01.786 --> 16:02.831
Will--

16:06.095 --> 16:08.445
- For god's sake.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.422
I can't do this.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.337
It's okay.
It's all about timing.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.556
This is why people
have automatics.

16:32.556 --> 16:33.993
Okay.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.432
When I squeeze,

16:38.432 --> 16:41.826
I want you to give it gas. Okay?

16:42.653 --> 16:44.351
Yeah.

16:57.451 --> 17:01.107
See? You did it.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.894
Whoa, we're moving.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.417
-  We're moving. Okay.
-  Yeah.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.550
-  Okay, nice and slow.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.769
Turn, turn, turn...

17:15.556 --> 17:19.168
- And come to a stop.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.086
It worked.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.178
Can I ask you a question?

17:31.006 --> 17:34.401
Who goes out onto a roof
to get close to the sky?

17:39.232 --> 17:43.279
Do you ever think about
where you go when you die?

17:53.159 --> 17:55.770
-  This is not stopping.
This is not stopping!

17:58.642 --> 18:00.514
Harper, I'm--I'm so sorry.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.342
- Don't sweat it. It's okay.
- Shit.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.175
You got a pen pal in Texas?

18:59.312 --> 19:01.183
Hey.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.490
Come here. Check this out.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.811
My dad was a genius.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.603
She never understood him.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.083
Maybe you don't understand her.

19:34.216 --> 19:37.045
When I lost my mom...

19:37.045 --> 19:39.743
that's when I realized how
important she was to my dad.

19:43.617 --> 19:47.316
-  Hey! I have take-out.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.014
Hey, hey.
Mom, did you know about this?

19:50.014 --> 19:53.192
- He kept such detailed notes.
- Where did you get that?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.672
Does it- does it matter?
I mean, you could use it
for your research.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.500
Harper. I think it's time
for Harper to go.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.242
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. No.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.157
What are you so upset about?

20:02.157 --> 20:04.507
This is the best chance I've
ever had at understanding Dad.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.553
I loved your dad.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.382
I miss him every bit
as much as you do, Will,

20:09.382 --> 20:11.688
but that book,
that book is not for you.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.386
- You are better than--
- Hey, hey, what the hell?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.998
Better than what?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.913
The man who got
all your research tested?

20:18.913 --> 20:20.784
And that's why you gave up
on fieldwork, right?

20:20.784 --> 20:22.351
Too much of a chicken shit
to put yourself in real danger?

20:22.351 --> 20:25.180
No, Will. gave up fieldwork
to be your mother.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.401
And sometimes
it's okay to be afraid

20:28.401 --> 20:30.229
because I am standing
here and he's not.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.407
When you do something you love,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

20:34.407 --> 20:37.018
Yeah, yeah. I heard that before.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.281
Thanks to you,
I have no idea who my dad was.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.248
I think I'll leave, actually.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.989
Oh... yeah.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.294
-  Will, honey?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.254
Will, you awake?

21:40.908 --> 21:42.344
Will?

21:57.838 --> 22:00.319
Oh, for the love of God.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.339
Thank you, sir.

25:14.817 --> 25:17.733
State your name and business.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.343
Uncle Roy?

25:26.263 --> 25:29.136
I knew I shouldn't have
put a return address.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.791
Hey, wait!

25:31.791 --> 25:33.880
How the hell did you
even get here anyway?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.795
I just took a few--

25:35.795 --> 25:40.713
And what in the world has that
woman been feeding you, huh?

25:40.713 --> 25:44.238
You know what?
Never mind, the less know...

25:45.848 --> 25:47.763
Let me guess, you came
to be a storm chaser

25:47.763 --> 25:49.243
just like your dad.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.158
No, I never
really thought about it.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.725
Yeah, I bet you didn't.

25:54.683 --> 25:57.468
Does your mom know you're here?

25:57.468 --> 25:59.949
I'm guessing not.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.865
She's the reason I'm here.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.955
She really never
talks about him anymore.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.566
So I started reading
through the journal--

26:07.566 --> 26:09.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:09.176 --> 26:11.482
The journal
wasn't an invitation.

26:11.482 --> 26:14.834
I'm not your parent.
I'm not even really your uncle.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.749
Your dad...

26:20.535 --> 26:22.406
There was no one like him.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.191
Never will be. Including you.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.628
There. That's the speech.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.899
She cleans houses, Roy.

26:39.423 --> 26:42.035
The smartest woman
you've ever met cleans houses.

26:44.211 --> 26:47.649
I can't babysit you, kid.
It is primetime storm season

26:47.649 --> 26:51.000
and now I make a living
babysitting tourists,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.915
and--and idiots.

26:52.915 --> 26:56.266
Idiot tourists, worst of all.

26:56.266 --> 26:59.269
But here, I'll tell you what.

27:01.097 --> 27:04.971
Here. Ticket home, it's on me.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.103
And then, if your mom asks,

27:07.103 --> 27:11.673
here, you couldn't find me
or--or I'm dead.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.327
You pick.

27:40.310 --> 27:43.400
-  Van is way
bigger than you.
-  Barely.

27:58.764 --> 28:02.681
Bill, your kid is here.

28:17.434 --> 28:20.133
You so much as breathe on me,
I will shoot you.

28:24.790 --> 28:27.793
Here, check this out.

28:31.622 --> 28:32.841
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

28:32.841 --> 28:34.582
<i>All that heating at 90 degrees</i>

28:34.582 --> 28:35.757
<i>cooking all that moisture.</i>

28:35.757 --> 28:37.280
You can't get out of the pot.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.762
Once that cap goes away,
it explodes.

28:40.762 --> 28:44.810
Then you kick in
the low-level jet. Bingo.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.203
What's this do?

28:47.203 --> 28:50.903
Well, police lights
for emergencies.

28:50.903 --> 28:55.385
- Is it legal?
- No, not-not exactly.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.127
Look, he's 16,
and he doesn't have his phone.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.347
So I'm sure he's gonna
be back before dark.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.001
If he ain't here by sundown,

29:02.001 --> 29:03.872
then we'll officially designate
him a missing person.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.569
Start an investigation.

29:05.569 --> 29:08.311
So what am I
supposed to do now?

29:08.311 --> 29:09.965
All you can do is wait.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.670
Son of a--

30:18.599 --> 30:20.122
It's about damn time.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.912
Hey, remember this.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.828
Please, you are not
William Brody.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.613
Not today. You stay put.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.838
Hi. Hey, good morning, everybody.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.274
- Yeah. Good morning.
- Good morning. Finally.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.058
Uh-huh.
Good morning, Chuck.

30:43.058 --> 30:47.019
Remember, today's the last day
to get your merchandise.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.847
[Chuck[ Yeah, no thanks.
You guys charge too much.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.413
Oh, come on, Chuck.
We take cash.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.634
- We take PayPal. We take--
- Are we gonna see a tornado?

30:56.289 --> 30:58.900
- Roy speaking.
-  <i>He's with you,
isn't he?</i>

31:04.732 --> 31:06.342
<i>-</i> Yeah.
<i>-</i> Where are you, Roy?

31:06.342 --> 31:07.691
I'm getting in the car.

31:07.691 --> 31:12.522
It's, uh...
it's our last day today, Quinn.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.611
I'll--I'll get him home.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.091
<i>Just know that he's safe, okay?</i>

31:16.091 --> 31:18.398
There is no place in that
entire time zone

31:18.398 --> 31:20.095
<i>that's safe this
time of year, Roy.</i>

31:20.095 --> 31:21.618
<i>Where's the target?</i>

31:21.618 --> 31:23.142
Call you back.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.505
Take it from me.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.942
Plan the wedding for winter.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.596
Then your wife's happy

31:42.596 --> 31:44.337
'cause you'll never risk
missing your anniversary

31:44.337 --> 31:45.816
for chase season.

31:51.213 --> 31:52.693
You lost?

31:52.693 --> 31:54.956
That's my nephew.
He's just here for the night.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.958
You're paying for his seat?

31:56.958 --> 31:59.395
We're not running
a charity here.

31:59.395 --> 32:00.788
Paperwork.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.057
Just sign this.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.757
It says consent of
the parent or guardian--

32:13.757 --> 32:15.759
For god's sake,
just sign the damn thing.

32:15.759 --> 32:19.502
He doesn't talk,
his name isn't on the manifest.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.939
He was never here.

32:22.679 --> 32:23.985
Let's go.

32:31.471 --> 32:32.733
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:32.733 --> 32:34.256
please keep your arms
and your legs

32:34.256 --> 32:35.475
inside the vehicle at all times.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.824
Thank you.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.001
Don't break anything.

32:41.611 --> 32:44.397
You better buckle up.
We got an enhanced risk today.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.225
So true.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.597
He's not here, is he?

33:10.597 --> 33:12.599
We--

33:12.599 --> 33:15.254
Well, let me come with.
I can help.

33:15.254 --> 33:18.909
You're a kid. Go home. No.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.404
How's Florida?

34:18.404 --> 34:19.970
It's a whole place.

34:19.970 --> 34:22.060
They get storms there, too.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.714
-  Lightning capital
of the world.

34:24.714 --> 34:29.110
I wouldn't call them storms.
More like afternoon showers.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.243
You're gonna get
an education today, kid.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.028
Kid's probably forgot
more about meteorology

34:34.028 --> 34:35.290
than you'll ever know.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.987
-  Him?
-  Yeah.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.902
All right, kid.

34:38.902 --> 34:41.079
Explain to me where
we're going today and why.

34:42.471 --> 34:43.646
May I?

34:49.174 --> 34:50.523
Judging from that,

34:50.523 --> 34:52.916
dry line's
over the Texas Panhandle.

34:52.916 --> 34:55.615
If dew points rise, converging
winds should set things off

34:55.615 --> 34:56.920
in a few hours.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.487
Should be an explosive day.

34:58.487 --> 35:01.490
But, uh, I'm sure
you all knew that.

35:01.490 --> 35:02.796
Kid's a genius.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.103
Nice.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.887
You want to bust my balls?

35:06.887 --> 35:10.108
Let's try it again
when we're in chaos.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.719
Finding the finger of God
inside of a target zone

35:12.719 --> 35:15.156
over 100,000 miles...

35:15.156 --> 35:16.636
...that's what we do.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.899
We do follow three rules.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.596
Rule number one:

35:20.596 --> 35:23.817
always make sure you got
at least a half a tank of gas.

35:23.817 --> 35:27.299
Rule number two:
always, always, always

35:27.299 --> 35:29.127
make sure you got an escape.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.999
Generally, these storms
move to the east and the north.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.001
Wait, why "generally?"

35:34.001 --> 35:35.959
It's just typical.
It's not hard and fast.

35:35.959 --> 35:39.441
The goal is to target
the southeast corner of a cell

35:39.441 --> 35:41.095
and to lead it.

35:41.095 --> 35:43.097
That way,
all you got to worry about

35:43.097 --> 35:45.534
is driving east and south
to get out of its way.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.493
Find yourself
having to improvise

35:47.493 --> 35:49.886
and you're already
in trouble.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.540
So what's rule number three?

35:55.196 --> 35:58.199
Never get caught
in the Bear's Cage.

35:58.199 --> 36:01.071
- Never get caught in the vault.
-  Mm-hmm.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.682
The most violent tornadoes
are rain-wrapped.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.553
You won't see nothing
until you're...

36:04.553 --> 36:07.165
30 feet in the sky.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.601
No, sir.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.211
Your first time?

36:10.211 --> 36:14.172
So, uh, what happens if you get
caught in the Bear's Cage?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.174
You better find
a ditch or a pool.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.611
Ha! Bring your sunblock
and your swim trunks,

36:18.611 --> 36:20.265
if you dare.

36:28.273 --> 36:32.581
Hey, chasin' is
90 percent driving

36:32.581 --> 36:36.194
and 10 percent witnessing
the Creator's wrath.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.196
I pride myself on
getting closer to the heat

36:38.196 --> 36:40.720
than any other tour company.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.244
When you kiss it
right on the mouth.

36:58.651 --> 37:01.262
So what's the deal
with the thing?

37:01.262 --> 37:02.785
What thing?

37:02.785 --> 37:05.788
It looked like a bomb.
Will took it up on the roof.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.094
Not a bomb.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.227
Not a bomb.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.970
It can save lives.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.326
So what's the deal
with you and Will?

37:23.545 --> 37:25.721
He thought you were pretty
since the third grade.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.161
That's not it.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.467
You treat him good.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.779
I... I like the way
that he looks at the sky.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.836
- It--it's fine.
- I...

37:53.836 --> 37:55.316
If you're gonna smoke,
it's fine.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.883
I'II save it or later.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.592
Cell's developing here
pretty quick.

38:15.162 --> 38:16.990
It's telling me
it's ten miles out.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.252
I can't see shit.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.514
Just wait till
we clear the rocks.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.998
Okay, once we clear the canyon,

38:24.998 --> 38:27.217
that's when you're gonna
want to pull out your cameras.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.572
Can I help you?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.851
What are you doing, boy?

38:51.851 --> 38:53.331
It's absolutely massive.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.203
Get back there
before it starts moving.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.118
Like having a puppy in the car.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.427
Do you want to get me fired?

39:06.518 --> 39:07.997
God Almighty.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.140
Hey,
pull over here, right here.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.795
You sure?
There's no pavement there.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.623
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.973
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
- What, Frank?
What are you gonna do?

39:26.973 --> 39:28.366
Don't park in the grass.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.411
Get off the grass, Zane.
You piece of shit.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.674
Blow that out your ass, Frank.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.908
Remember,
stay away from the road.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.693
Stay tight as a group.
And when I say we go, we go.

39:51.693 --> 39:55.567
And hey,
enjoy the show.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.133
Keep him on a leash.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.840
-  Finally.

40:15.804 --> 40:19.417
See how the anvil blasts
miles out over the horizon?

40:30.558 --> 40:31.907
You feel that?

40:33.822 --> 40:36.477
That cool breeze?
You feel it?

40:38.566 --> 40:42.004
Yeah, that's her outflow.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.963
I don't remember them
being this big.

40:46.052 --> 40:49.011
Well, they get bigger.

40:49.011 --> 40:53.015
You got yourself
a classic Supercell right there.

40:53.015 --> 40:56.454
You can see her rotating from
the wall cloud below the base

40:56.454 --> 40:59.848
all the way up her updraft.

40:59.848 --> 41:03.939
Now... when the wind
turns warm from the back,

41:03.939 --> 41:06.594
that's when she's feeding,

41:06.594 --> 41:08.596
growing toward you.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.470
I should have brought my phone.

41:15.298 --> 41:18.432
Hey, Chuck,
you're boning my shot.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.794
Keep your eye on that funnel!
This thing is happening.

41:32.794 --> 41:36.363
Right now, it's just a funnel.

41:36.363 --> 41:37.799
But watch.

41:39.061 --> 41:41.673
Watch. Watch the ground beneath.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.979
Soon as you see
debris kick up...

41:45.633 --> 41:48.288
you got yourself
a bona fide tornado.

41:56.688 --> 41:57.950
It's real.

42:00.213 --> 42:01.475
Wow.

42:10.789 --> 42:13.182
This is gonna buy me a Rolex.

42:15.184 --> 42:17.622
Why aren't we closer?

42:17.622 --> 42:19.928
We got the best seat
in the house.

42:19.928 --> 42:24.672
Being in the front row
just gets you killed.

42:24.672 --> 42:28.589
- The cell to the south is
choking her off.

42:29.851 --> 42:32.332
-  Come on.
-  Let's go!

42:32.332 --> 42:34.726
- Let's go!
- Everybody in the van!

42:34.726 --> 42:37.119
- Big winds on the way.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.818
Let's go! Let's go! Get in!

42:42.908 --> 42:44.083
God.

42:51.090 --> 42:53.919
Shit.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.704
-  I'm gunning it.
It's not moving.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.099
Give it a rest.

43:03.798 --> 43:06.540
Hail core's about
to pass overhead.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.209
Two inches?

43:26.125 --> 43:27.430
Three and a half.

43:30.651 --> 43:31.957
Is it bad?

43:33.741 --> 43:35.351
It's real bad.

44:10.430 --> 44:11.910
Everybody okay?

44:15.217 --> 44:17.089
Is that a yes?!

44:17.089 --> 44:19.439
-  Yeah. We're okay.

44:19.439 --> 44:23.138
You just experienced
gorilla hail. Ha-ha.

44:26.925 --> 44:28.143
You're welcome.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.583
Did you see
the size of the hail?

44:44.246 --> 44:46.727
That's what we get
for going off the pavement.

44:46.727 --> 44:49.599
Storage is just over
the state line from Shamrock.

44:49.599 --> 44:51.427
You want me
to get the other van?

44:51.427 --> 44:53.255
Try to catch us one more
chase before sundown.

44:53.255 --> 44:55.736
Hey, listen,
I want to talk to you.

44:55.736 --> 44:57.085
I think we can get
our money back.

44:57.085 --> 44:59.174
Hey, don't even
think about it, Chuck.

44:59.174 --> 45:00.393
You're not getting your money back.

45:00.393 --> 45:02.308
You signed a waiver, remember?

45:02.308 --> 45:04.136
Hey, was hat a tornado?

45:05.746 --> 45:07.748
If it was,
we'd be deader than dead.

45:10.882 --> 45:14.363
Yes, I know. So you guys
are still in Panhandle?

45:14.363 --> 45:16.191
<i>We'll be in Liberal tonight.</i>

45:16.191 --> 45:18.759
<i>-</i> Kansas?
<i>-</i> Yeah, that's the one.

45:18.759 --> 45:20.935
<i>I should be there by lunch.</i>

45:22.502 --> 45:23.938
You're, uh...

45:23.938 --> 45:26.724
you're not mad at me, are you?
He ambushed me.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.770
<i>You have my only kid, Roy.</i>

45:29.770 --> 45:32.512
He doesn't know
how dangerous this world is.

45:33.818 --> 45:35.994
He's in good hands.

45:35.994 --> 45:38.083
Damn, girl.
Where are you coming from?

45:38.083 --> 45:40.738
Right. I'll be in touch.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.741
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.351
If you want to hit on somebody,

45:45.351 --> 45:46.874
why don't you hit on
someone your age, eh?

45:46.874 --> 45:50.617
Yeah.
You got a smoke?

45:52.837 --> 45:54.142
Oh, thanks, man.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.578
Lighter.

45:58.059 --> 46:00.453
Trade that.
Gentlemen shouldn't smoke.

46:00.453 --> 46:04.152
I was just playing around.
Where are you going?

46:04.152 --> 46:06.676
You ever been to Kansas,
Dorothy?

46:54.724 --> 46:56.596
Why didn't he listen to you?

46:58.511 --> 47:00.556
Well, Zane's changed.

47:04.169 --> 47:05.997
Every time you sell
one of those trucker hats

47:05.997 --> 47:08.260
with our name on it,

47:08.260 --> 47:09.652
does my mom get a cut?

47:12.394 --> 47:14.092
Yeah.

47:14.092 --> 47:16.050
I already knew
the answer to that.

47:17.617 --> 47:20.315
You know...

47:20.315 --> 47:22.709
one of the things
I loved most about your dad?

47:22.709 --> 47:24.842
How he could...

47:24.842 --> 47:27.279
He could look up at the sky
and know...

47:27.279 --> 47:28.846
everything
he needed to know.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.718
He didn't need
some radar on his phone.

47:35.983 --> 47:39.857
Nowadays, you download some app,

47:39.857 --> 47:43.686
run a car,
you call yourself a chaser.

47:43.686 --> 47:45.514
What's that
got to do with anything?

47:47.342 --> 47:48.822
Right after we lost your dad,

47:48.822 --> 47:51.694
your mom was
forced to bankrupt the lab.

47:51.694 --> 47:56.351
Brody Storm Labs eventually
became Brody Storm Tours...

47:57.831 --> 48:00.094
And here we are.

48:00.094 --> 48:02.705
What about Zane?

48:02.705 --> 48:04.577
You really needed
that guy as a partner?

48:06.840 --> 48:08.929
Do I look like a partner?

48:10.278 --> 48:12.890
Huh? I'm an employee.

48:14.065 --> 48:15.631
Hey...

48:15.631 --> 48:17.329
I gotta eat.

48:17.329 --> 48:18.678
So do we.

48:18.678 --> 48:21.202
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
If it helps...

48:22.900 --> 48:25.163
your name is
the only reason it's still here.

48:26.947 --> 48:28.949
It has value.
It means something.

48:28.949 --> 48:31.821
Yeah. That some crazy asshole
got two students killed.

48:38.654 --> 48:39.917
We gotta go.

48:42.963 --> 48:44.269
Come on!

49:07.335 --> 49:08.989
See that wall of cloud?

49:08.989 --> 49:10.425
Wait, that one?

49:10.425 --> 49:13.428
You dumb son of a bitch,
that one right there.

49:14.690 --> 49:16.431
Hurry up!

49:16.431 --> 49:18.564
Round the place.

49:18.564 --> 49:19.957
There's Cornshit.

49:22.481 --> 49:24.135
Hurry up.

49:24.135 --> 49:25.919
Get the mask.
Put them inside. Let's go.

49:25.919 --> 49:27.965
Okay, all right. Start it up.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.315
Took you long enough.

49:30.315 --> 49:33.231
- Pulled a two-hour turn around.
- Okay, kid. Get out.

49:35.450 --> 49:38.801
You change his diapers?

49:38.801 --> 49:41.326
Chuck is really startin' to
piss me off this year.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.657
-  Daphne, you hear me?

50:08.657 --> 50:12.139
Put it down.
You don't need that.

50:12.139 --> 50:15.534
You only get one.
You hear me? One.

50:46.478 --> 50:48.175
That's us. Let's go.

50:50.525 --> 50:52.136
Where's the kid?

50:52.136 --> 50:54.051
- I don't know.
- We gotta go, man.

51:03.756 --> 51:06.193
<i>The National
Weather Service in Warren Town</i>

51:06.193 --> 51:08.326
<i>has issued
a Tornado warning for:</i>

51:08.326 --> 51:10.502
<i>Anderson County, Norton County,</i>

51:10.502 --> 51:13.722
<i>Bolton County, Warren County...
...at 1:45 p.m.</i>

51:13.722 --> 51:15.811
Mind your manners.

51:15.811 --> 51:17.639
<i>National Weather Service
Doppler radar indicated...</i>

51:17.639 --> 51:19.424
Hey, man. You got the time?

51:19.424 --> 51:20.773
<i>...a severe thunderstorm
capable of producing a tornado</i>

51:20.773 --> 51:22.122
<i>five miles northwest.</i>

51:26.518 --> 51:29.477
- Look, he's safer here anyway.
- We can come back for him.

51:29.477 --> 51:31.349
We'll be leaving in
just a moment, folks. Yeah.

51:31.349 --> 51:35.483
There's one person in there,
a there's a whole bunch here.

51:35.483 --> 51:39.574
This is not a choice;
I will fire you.

51:55.416 --> 51:57.679
<i>...for potential shelter...</i>

51:57.679 --> 51:59.507
Don't worry.
If it was headed this way,

51:59.507 --> 52:01.988
all those chasers
would still be here.

52:30.582 --> 52:32.018
Lock that door.

52:32.018 --> 52:33.672
Lock it.

52:55.607 --> 52:57.174
Shelter.

53:06.226 --> 53:07.967
This isn't a shelter.

53:11.797 --> 53:13.799
No, no, no!

53:47.833 --> 53:49.791
Yeah, he's in here.

53:50.879 --> 53:52.403
How many--

53:52.403 --> 53:55.623
Your nephew's got a horseshoe
stuck up is ass.

53:55.623 --> 53:58.060
Probably make
the seven o'clock news.

53:59.975 --> 54:02.021
That'd be good.

54:04.545 --> 54:06.982
We're here with the son of
the legendary Storm Chaser

54:06.982 --> 54:08.288
Bill Brody, who just survived

54:08.288 --> 54:10.508
the Shamrock tornado
in a phone booth.

54:10.508 --> 54:13.685
Tell us what
happened here today.

54:13.685 --> 54:15.252
Well, yeah. Well, I-I was--

54:15.252 --> 54:16.644
Hey, everybody. I'm Zane Rogers,

54:16.644 --> 54:19.821
proud owner of
the Brody Storm Tours Company.

54:19.821 --> 54:23.085
William Brody here is set to
join the family business and--

54:23.085 --> 54:25.218
and carry on his father's work.
Am I right, son?

54:25.218 --> 54:28.090
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, you're interrupting me.

54:28.090 --> 54:29.962
You may have been able
to buy the Brody name,

54:29.962 --> 54:32.269
- but you will never be
Bill Brody.
- Oh, really?

54:32.269 --> 54:35.315
Aren't you the one that turned
his father into a hood ornament?

54:36.490 --> 54:37.883
Yeah.

54:37.883 --> 54:40.146
We are the premier
tour company in this area.

54:40.146 --> 54:41.495
hope you realize
we've been doing this

54:41.495 --> 54:43.454
for probably nigh on
about 20--

54:50.243 --> 54:51.897
You can fire me now.

54:51.897 --> 54:53.681
Hurry, hurry. Set up the shots.

54:53.681 --> 54:55.727
-  Hold on. Hold on.

54:55.727 --> 54:57.468
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:57.468 --> 54:59.296
-  Zoom in on him.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.949
- Where the hell were you?
- Huh? What?

55:00.949 --> 55:02.342
You know what I'm talking about.

55:02.342 --> 55:03.735
Do you have any idea
how scared I was?

55:03.735 --> 55:05.040
I just wanted some popcorn.

55:05.040 --> 55:08.043
You think this is a game?

55:09.523 --> 55:10.829
No.

55:15.442 --> 55:17.357
Then why'd you send me this?

55:17.357 --> 55:20.404
What? What use is it to me?

55:20.404 --> 55:22.319
I thought it was a nice gesture.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.972
No, that's bullshit.

55:28.150 --> 55:29.500
No, you need me.

55:31.589 --> 55:33.895
The hell I do.
What do I need with a kid?

55:38.857 --> 55:40.075
I'll show you.

55:51.522 --> 55:53.132
I'll be damned.

55:55.395 --> 55:56.570
She did it.

55:56.570 --> 55:58.398
I got to charge it tonight, but...

55:59.660 --> 56:01.445
I found it.

56:01.445 --> 56:02.881
Found- found what?

56:05.492 --> 56:08.060
Mom. She cracked it.

56:09.757 --> 56:11.324
All this time...

56:11.324 --> 56:13.195
Now we can hear it
coming from miles away.

56:17.199 --> 56:18.375
Wait.

56:20.115 --> 56:21.290
Hey.

56:25.251 --> 56:26.513
- Wow.

56:38.786 --> 56:40.266
Go on. Get in.

57:06.161 --> 57:07.467
I can almost smell him.

57:09.774 --> 57:13.604
My dad, his hands were so big.

57:17.346 --> 57:19.784
I'd stare at them for hours
while he drove.

57:22.003 --> 57:23.744
I'd wonder if mine
would look like that.

57:25.093 --> 57:26.530
That's what makes you a man.

57:28.662 --> 57:30.142
To be honest, Will,
I don't think that

57:30.142 --> 57:31.535
has anything to do with it.

57:44.286 --> 57:45.897
Hey, slide over.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.814
- Where are we going?
- Oh, you'll see.

58:17.537 --> 58:18.712
Keep your eyes on the radar.

58:18.712 --> 58:20.061
I'll watch the road.

58:27.634 --> 58:29.157
You got a girl?

58:32.465 --> 58:34.598
Yeah? Is she cute?

58:34.598 --> 58:36.208
She's smart.

58:36.208 --> 58:37.514
That's what I like.

58:38.950 --> 58:40.517
Cute, too, bet.

58:42.301 --> 58:43.824
Since the seventh grade.

58:53.791 --> 58:56.663
All right,
we're through it in no time.

58:57.882 --> 58:59.971
How long you two been dating?

58:59.971 --> 59:01.276
I don't know.

59:02.974 --> 59:04.323
We're just friends.

59:05.585 --> 59:06.891
That won't keep.

59:08.893 --> 59:10.329
You're a Brody.

59:17.379 --> 59:20.208
All right. You ready?

59:37.965 --> 59:40.577
Welcome to
the backside of a Supercell.

59:44.232 --> 59:46.060
This is unbelievable.

59:54.112 --> 59:55.330
Hey.

1:00:17.265 --> 1:00:19.050
You think
I'll ever see him again?

1:00:21.966 --> 1:00:23.445
I mean...

1:00:23.445 --> 1:00:25.578
when it's over for me, too.

1:00:27.319 --> 1:00:28.625
Do you think so?

1:00:33.717 --> 1:00:36.241
I'm not much of
the spiritual type. But...

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:39.592
I'll tell you what.

1:00:41.725 --> 1:00:43.988
There was this, uh...

1:00:43.988 --> 1:00:48.645
old lady in--in Shamrock.

1:00:48.645 --> 1:00:51.648
Back in '77, and she told me...

1:00:52.823 --> 1:00:54.868
she left for the bank one day,

1:00:54.868 --> 1:00:59.220
and, um, she forgot her paycheck
on the dining room table.

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:03.790
That day, a tornado
took her home, everything,

1:01:03.790 --> 1:01:06.184
everything was gone.

1:01:06.184 --> 1:01:10.188
The fridge had been tossed
about two miles on the other
side of 1-40.

1:01:12.538 --> 1:01:14.671
The only thing left standing...

1:01:16.411 --> 1:01:20.633
was that dining table,
with the check still on it.

1:01:25.116 --> 1:01:27.161
If there's
anything I've learned

1:01:27.161 --> 1:01:28.859
from all of this, it's...

1:01:30.034 --> 1:01:32.166
any law you got,

1:01:33.298 --> 1:01:34.778
it will defy it.

1:01:40.566 --> 1:01:41.872
So yeah.

1:01:44.439 --> 1:01:47.051
Yeah, I think
you'll see your dad again.

1:01:48.792 --> 1:01:51.272
Well, uh...

1:01:51.272 --> 1:01:54.232
Mom won't be
cleaning houses much longer.

1:01:54.232 --> 1:01:55.668
I'll make sure of that.

1:01:58.105 --> 1:02:02.544
The sky will always show
you something you haven't seen.

1:02:02.544 --> 1:02:05.069
It's why we feel the way we do
the morning of a chase.

1:02:07.811 --> 1:02:09.073
For me...

1:02:10.596 --> 1:02:12.903
well, that's the end of it.

1:02:12.903 --> 1:02:16.558
Well, I'm just getting started.

1:02:26.873 --> 1:02:30.007
Woo-hooo!

1:02:30.007 --> 1:02:33.793
Whoo! Whooo!

1:02:33.793 --> 1:02:35.839
- Whoo-hoo!

1:02:45.936 --> 1:02:50.070
You know, Will made me watch
every episode of <i>Storm Chasers.</i>

1:02:50.070 --> 1:02:51.898
That must have been painful.

1:02:53.204 --> 1:02:55.772
Why'd you let them film you?

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:57.774
Bill thought...

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.079
that if we raised our profile,

1:02:59.079 --> 1:03:00.777
people would
open up their pocketbooks.

1:03:02.387 --> 1:03:04.476
He was right.

1:03:04.476 --> 1:03:06.957
You're lucky, Harper.

1:03:06.957 --> 1:03:09.350
Money solves a lot of problems.

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:14.268
If I could, I'd trade it all

1:03:14.268 --> 1:03:15.835
for my dad to come
watch me play soccer.

1:03:24.670 --> 1:03:26.454
You know, a long time ago,

1:03:26.454 --> 1:03:29.457
Bill introduced me to the sky,
and I fell in love with him.

1:03:31.416 --> 1:03:33.679
He also used my science in a
whole bunch of different ways

1:03:33.679 --> 1:03:34.898
that nobody ever had
in the business.

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:36.421
I don't understand.

1:03:36.421 --> 1:03:39.293
You guys were the best at what
you did. How could--

1:03:57.311 --> 1:03:59.139
When you do something
as dangerous

1:03:59.139 --> 1:04:02.708
as going into a place where
the wind that can throw your car

1:04:02.708 --> 1:04:04.492
hundreds of yards,

1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:07.104
every ride home,

1:04:09.236 --> 1:04:11.586
you get little more numb.

1:04:11.586 --> 1:04:13.284
So the next time you go back...

1:04:15.112 --> 1:04:17.679
you want to go in further...

1:04:17.679 --> 1:04:19.551
and you want to stay longer...

1:04:20.682 --> 1:04:23.772
to satisfy some sort of...

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:26.166
<i>what, I don't know.</i>

1:04:31.476 --> 1:04:33.870
If my grad student
hadn't taken a friend,

1:04:36.655 --> 1:04:38.178
they'd be here.

1:04:39.571 --> 1:04:41.790
If they would have loaded one

1:04:41.790 --> 1:04:45.055
<i>50-pound probe into the truck
rather than two,</i>

1:04:46.099 --> 1:04:47.753
they'd be here.

1:04:47.753 --> 1:04:50.582
If they'd taken
Highway 44, they'd be here.

1:04:54.542 --> 1:04:58.111
If they had been on
any other stretch of land

1:04:58.111 --> 1:04:59.678
at that moment, they...

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:07.381
I used to think that the risk
that we took

1:05:07.381 --> 1:05:09.557
had some
sort of calling because...

1:05:18.827 --> 1:05:21.439
Because we chased
for knowledge...

1:05:22.614 --> 1:05:23.920
not thrill.

1:05:26.052 --> 1:05:29.229
I guess Mother Nature
doesn't care.

1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:35.801
Then why do it?

1:05:37.759 --> 1:05:40.719
Because somebody has to.

1:05:40.719 --> 1:05:42.503
I just don't want it to be Will.

1:06:07.659 --> 1:06:09.269
Dry line stalled.

1:06:09.269 --> 1:06:11.184
Take a look at these
lapse rates for tomorrow.

1:06:11.184 --> 1:06:12.969
Oh, you thinking about
Southwest Nebraska?

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.796
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

1:06:14.796 --> 1:06:16.276
- Hey, bud.
-  Hey.

1:06:16.276 --> 1:06:18.975
You chase today?

1:06:18.975 --> 1:06:20.498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For the first time.

1:06:20.498 --> 1:06:22.369
All right, hang on.
Give this kid a beer.

1:06:22.369 --> 1:06:23.849
- Come on in, buddy.
- Sure.

1:06:23.849 --> 1:06:25.894
Yeah, first chase,
first beer, man.

1:06:25.894 --> 1:06:27.026
Thanks, guys.

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:29.028
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

1:06:29.028 --> 1:06:31.117
You know about
the HRRR and the NAMNEST?

1:06:31.117 --> 1:06:33.076
Um, yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

1:06:33.076 --> 1:06:35.513
Okay. What about, uh,
what about CAPE values?

1:06:35.513 --> 1:06:36.993
Look, let me tell you.

1:06:36.993 --> 1:06:39.778
Okay, so at about
a thousand CAPE, all right,

1:06:39.778 --> 1:06:40.953
- you're gonna get thunderstorms.
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:40.953 --> 1:06:42.215
It's as simple as that.

1:06:42.215 --> 1:06:44.000
Today, the CAPE was 2,600

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.523
and you saw
what happened, right?

1:06:45.523 --> 1:06:49.744
All right, now look at this.
At four p.m. tomorrow...

1:06:49.744 --> 1:06:51.007
Six p.m.

1:06:52.356 --> 1:06:54.053
Eight p.m.

1:06:54.053 --> 1:06:57.709
At eight p.m., Southwest
Nebraska is forecasted to see

1:06:57.709 --> 1:07:00.929
CAPE values between
4,500 and 5,000.

1:07:00.929 --> 1:07:02.235
A loaded gun.

1:07:02.235 --> 1:07:04.498
That-that's good, right?

1:07:04.498 --> 1:07:07.719
Is it good? Son, those are
Wichita Fall numbers.

1:07:07.719 --> 1:07:09.025
Yeah.

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:10.504
The day Bill Brody
and those kids

1:07:10.504 --> 1:07:12.506
became a missile.

1:07:12.506 --> 1:07:14.030
-  Ding dong.

1:07:14.030 --> 1:07:16.119
Mr. Brody Storm Tours himself!

1:07:16.119 --> 1:07:18.121
Zane, kid here
popped his cherry today.

1:07:18.121 --> 1:07:19.774
-  No shit.
-  Yup.

1:07:19.774 --> 1:07:21.689
I'm so sorry, guys.
Thanks for the beer.

1:07:21.689 --> 1:07:23.517
Um, I--I should go.

1:07:23.517 --> 1:07:25.911
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:07:25.911 --> 1:07:29.045
You don't know who this is?

1:07:29.045 --> 1:07:31.438
You're disrespecting
his old man?

1:07:31.438 --> 1:07:34.398
This is Bill Brody's son!

1:07:35.442 --> 1:07:38.967
Wait, you're the kid?

1:07:38.967 --> 1:07:42.275
I heard that you rode one out
in a phone booth.

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:46.192
Hey, your father's a legend.

1:07:50.153 --> 1:07:53.069
This kid's parents are
the reason I started chasing.

1:07:54.026 --> 1:07:55.375
Did you know that?

1:07:56.463 --> 1:07:58.030
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1:07:58.030 --> 1:08:00.163
Wow.
The probes they engineered.

1:08:00.163 --> 1:08:02.861
Yeah. They--they still hold
the record for most intercepts.

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:05.994
Boy, your mom has some brass.

1:08:05.994 --> 1:08:07.561
We used to call her
the Mama Bear

1:08:07.561 --> 1:08:10.086
because of all the time
she spent in that Bear's Cage.

1:08:11.609 --> 1:08:13.915
Nobody collects data there
unless it's by accident.

1:08:13.915 --> 1:08:15.961
Yeah, except for the Brodys.

1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:23.795
Bill Brody did things
nobody else dared to do

1:08:23.795 --> 1:08:25.840
and he did 'em
again and again.

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:27.929
I mean, he pulled off
the moon landing

1:08:27.929 --> 1:08:29.931
with nothing more than
a high school diploma.

1:08:29.931 --> 1:08:33.152
Now how does somebody like that
ever get into money trouble?

1:08:33.152 --> 1:08:35.285
I--I don't follow.

1:08:35.285 --> 1:08:37.417
Science love scientists.

1:08:37.417 --> 1:08:38.984
Even though
your dad had your mom,

1:08:38.984 --> 1:08:40.594
he was always
gonna be an outsider.

1:08:40.594 --> 1:08:43.684
People love labels. It's easier.

1:08:43.684 --> 1:08:45.251
To them, he was...

1:08:45.251 --> 1:08:47.166
an adrenaline junkie.

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:49.473
- Just like the rest of us.
- Cheers.

1:08:49.473 --> 1:08:51.301
- Why can't you be both?

1:08:52.650 --> 1:08:53.912
Well...

1:08:53.912 --> 1:08:55.783
when you're ready
to prove them wrong,

1:08:55.783 --> 1:08:57.176
you know where to find me.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:01.702
Anyway...

1:09:03.356 --> 1:09:05.880
I need my hat here, boy.

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:09.275
I got me a van
full of new troops in the AM

1:09:09.275 --> 1:09:12.278
and I don't have
an effing driver. Gawd!

1:09:12.278 --> 1:09:14.150
Ah, I should probably
head out too, guys.

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:16.413
All right, well, hey, boys.

1:09:16.413 --> 1:09:18.023
Y'all be safe tomorrow.

1:09:18.023 --> 1:09:20.286
If those Southwesterlies
get backed by the southeast...

1:09:20.286 --> 1:09:22.114
Wake up. Whoo!

1:09:22.114 --> 1:09:23.681
Don't become friends with them.

1:09:23.681 --> 1:09:26.336
They're gonna be dead
by the end of the month.

1:09:26.336 --> 1:09:28.468
-  Son of a bitch.

1:09:28.468 --> 1:09:29.687
Hey.

1:09:30.427 --> 1:09:31.689
Hey!

1:09:32.472 --> 1:09:33.517
Wait.

1:09:36.868 --> 1:09:39.305
Why did you tel me all that?

1:09:39.305 --> 1:09:41.438
I meant everything I said.

1:09:42.656 --> 1:09:44.310
But there's a dark side to this,

1:09:44.310 --> 1:09:46.530
and your father
crossed over from time to time.

1:09:46.530 --> 1:09:48.096
Shit, we all have.

1:09:48.096 --> 1:09:51.143
But he never lost sight
of what was important.

1:09:55.974 --> 1:09:57.367
Nice watch.

1:09:58.281 --> 1:09:59.717
Battle scars.

1:10:01.284 --> 1:10:02.937
I dig it.

1:10:29.573 --> 1:10:31.357
We were all laughing.

1:10:38.756 --> 1:10:40.279
Hey.

1:10:43.630 --> 1:10:45.676
That's Bill Brody's son.

1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:50.333
It's your fan club.

1:10:53.597 --> 1:10:55.381
What's happening?

1:10:55.381 --> 1:10:57.296
Ghost of a giant, kid.

1:10:57.296 --> 1:10:58.776
Follow me.

1:11:18.448 --> 1:11:21.146
- Are you some sort of celebrity?

1:11:24.367 --> 1:11:27.370
So, what can I get you fellas?

1:11:27.370 --> 1:11:31.287
I am gonna have the world-famous
huevos rancheros, please.

1:11:32.897 --> 1:11:33.854
You know what?

1:11:33.854 --> 1:11:35.769
Make it two.

1:11:38.424 --> 1:11:43.255
I hate to be a bother,
but how bad is it gonna get?

1:11:43.255 --> 1:11:44.691
Where do you live?

1:11:44.691 --> 1:11:47.085
Well, I'm just a couple
of miles down the road.

1:11:47.085 --> 1:11:49.522
But my sister lives up in Colby.

1:11:49.522 --> 1:11:51.524
- Does she have a shelter?
- Yes, sir.

1:11:51.524 --> 1:11:52.917
Tell her to stay near it.

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:54.353
The storms are probably
going to clear

1:11:54.353 --> 1:11:56.921
to the northeast,
but best be safe.

1:12:01.012 --> 1:12:03.014
I used my dad's concept
as a guide.

1:12:10.151 --> 1:12:12.589
So, uh, when I reviewed
the models...

1:12:12.589 --> 1:12:14.634
-  Hey, new reports out.
-  ...it all clicked.

1:12:14.634 --> 1:12:16.506
-  What does it say?
-  Imperial, yeah.

1:12:16.506 --> 1:12:18.943
-  Oh, really?
-  Hey, hey,
Southwest Nebraska.

1:12:18.943 --> 1:12:20.336
Well, don't wait for us!
Let's go!

1:12:29.519 --> 1:12:32.696
No, no, no.
Your mom is meeting us here.

1:12:32.696 --> 1:12:35.263
And she's on her way.
Until then, we stay put.

1:12:35.263 --> 1:12:37.570
How does she know where I was?

1:12:37.570 --> 1:12:40.312
You're my responsibility
until you become your mom's,

1:12:40.312 --> 1:12:42.880
so sit your ass down.

1:12:44.664 --> 1:12:46.231
Don't wait, bro. Let's go.

1:12:46.231 --> 1:12:47.841
Roy Cameron.

1:12:50.627 --> 1:12:51.845
Just wait.

1:12:51.845 --> 1:12:54.152
If you taste those
huevos rancheros,

1:12:54.152 --> 1:12:55.806
it'll change your life.

1:12:55.806 --> 1:12:59.113
Hey, get outta there.
You're being a dick. Let's go.

1:12:59.113 --> 1:13:01.377
You boys ready? Let's go.

1:13:07.078 --> 1:13:10.429
Got a high roller today,
bought out the tour.

1:13:10.429 --> 1:13:12.431
Can't afford to worry about
an intercept now.

1:13:12.431 --> 1:13:15.391
Just get me within range.
I need this.

1:13:15.391 --> 1:13:18.829
And think of the story;
it'll tell itself.

1:13:18.829 --> 1:13:21.092
Okay. The next few hours,
I'm God.

1:13:21.092 --> 1:13:23.529
Whatever I say goes. All right?

1:13:23.529 --> 1:13:26.010
Have you ever heard of
plausible deniability?

1:13:26.010 --> 1:13:27.359
Every day.

1:13:27.359 --> 1:13:29.056
- I'm serious.

1:13:29.056 --> 1:13:30.928
If you're tired of
messing around,

1:13:30.928 --> 1:13:32.625
being a tour operator...

1:13:34.148 --> 1:13:35.411
give me a call.

1:13:38.457 --> 1:13:40.677
- Say hi to Kim for me.
- I will.

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:56.214
Not again.

1:14:26.070 --> 1:14:28.942
Mr. Khan,
you're in for a treat today.

1:14:28.942 --> 1:14:31.292
We've got the son of the
legendary Storm Chaser,

1:14:31.292 --> 1:14:33.207
Bill Brody,
riding along with us.

1:14:36.646 --> 1:14:40.258
Big Bill. The Dalai Lama
of storm chasers.

1:14:44.523 --> 1:14:46.177
What did he say?

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:48.571
You like history?

1:14:48.571 --> 1:14:49.876
I love history.

1:14:49.876 --> 1:14:52.879
In 1949, a guy named
Dr. Horace Byers

1:14:52.879 --> 1:14:55.273
was hired by
the government to find out why

1:14:55.273 --> 1:14:58.885
commercial airliners
were falling out of the sky.

1:14:58.885 --> 1:15:01.584
He got some fighter pilots
to fly their jets

1:15:01.584 --> 1:15:03.542
through thunderstorms
and they discovered

1:15:03.542 --> 1:15:06.502
that nearly all storms
are like lungs.

1:15:06.502 --> 1:15:08.721
One breath in, one breath out. Simple.

1:15:10.549 --> 1:15:12.420
But there was an outlier.

1:15:13.813 --> 1:15:15.511
Under the right conditions,

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:18.078
there was a particular storm
that would rotate its rain

1:15:18.078 --> 1:15:19.471
out of its throat,

1:15:19.471 --> 1:15:22.518
allowing it
to breathe in and out...

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:23.649
for hours.

1:15:23.649 --> 1:15:25.782
You know what he called it?

1:15:27.435 --> 1:15:28.654
Supercell.

1:15:31.788 --> 1:15:32.919
Good boy.

1:15:51.851 --> 1:15:54.462
Roy. Uh-huh.

1:15:57.117 --> 1:15:58.423
Hello, Roy.

1:15:58.423 --> 1:16:00.817
- He abducted me.
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

1:16:02.253 --> 1:16:03.559
You look...

1:16:05.604 --> 1:16:07.563
like a whole person still.

1:16:07.563 --> 1:16:08.868
Gee, thanks.

1:16:08.868 --> 1:16:10.217
Where's my son
before I castrate you?

1:16:10.217 --> 1:16:11.741
Really? In front of the kid?

1:16:11.741 --> 1:16:13.220
I'm 17.

1:16:14.874 --> 1:16:17.442
You're the heartbreaker
since the seventh grade.

1:16:17.442 --> 1:16:18.574
Where's my son, Roy?

1:16:40.639 --> 1:16:44.121
We haven't seen storm
as severe as this before.

1:17:16.675 --> 1:17:18.242
Does that tin can work?

1:17:25.075 --> 1:17:26.685
<i>Zane, come in.</i>

1:17:26.685 --> 1:17:28.121
<i>You got William Brody
with you?</i>

1:17:28.121 --> 1:17:30.341
<i>-</i> [William] Shit.

1:17:30.341 --> 1:17:32.299
Hey, hey, hey. Careful.

1:17:34.388 --> 1:17:36.303
Put it back in the van.
Let's go.

1:17:45.704 --> 1:17:47.271
can't believe it.

1:17:47.271 --> 1:17:49.055
You're still pulling
the same shit

1:17:49.055 --> 1:17:50.361
that you did ten years ago?

1:17:50.361 --> 1:17:51.710
Why don't you just eliminate me?

1:17:51.710 --> 1:17:54.017
You're so good at
eliminating the Brodys.

1:17:54.017 --> 1:17:55.714
You know, if it wasn't for me,

1:17:55.714 --> 1:17:58.935
Bill would have checked out
long before Wichita Falls.

1:17:58.935 --> 1:18:00.806
I took on that man's load

1:18:00.806 --> 1:18:03.679
while you stayed at home
playing keyboard cowboy!

1:18:03.679 --> 1:18:05.376
I was raising our son, Roy.

1:18:05.376 --> 1:18:07.117
But I stayed here!

1:18:07.987 --> 1:18:10.033
I was here...

1:18:10.033 --> 1:18:12.644
trying to--to
preserve something.

1:18:12.644 --> 1:18:13.906
And I gotta tell you
something, Quinn.

1:18:13.906 --> 1:18:15.778
Your son?

1:18:15.778 --> 1:18:17.867
He is one of us.

1:18:17.867 --> 1:18:20.957
You had no right to give him
that journal, Roy.

1:18:20.957 --> 1:18:22.523
He loves you, Quinn,

1:18:22.523 --> 1:18:24.874
but you can't put a collar
on a no-collar dog

1:18:24.874 --> 1:18:26.832
- and expect him to be happy.
- Hey!

1:18:27.964 --> 1:18:29.748
Shouldn't we be chasing?

1:18:32.925 --> 1:18:34.710
I'll drive my husband's truck.

1:18:40.237 --> 1:18:42.543
- You getting in?

1:19:05.784 --> 1:19:08.831
Buckle up. We're going to war.

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:12.486
So exciting to be here.

1:19:15.185 --> 1:19:17.013
So exciting to be here.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:37.337
-  Anything?

1:19:59.882 --> 1:20:02.275
I thought Imperial
was the target.

1:20:02.275 --> 1:20:04.843
Not for deployment.

1:20:04.843 --> 1:20:06.627
But we don't need to get close
with the microphone.

1:20:06.627 --> 1:20:08.891
The whole point is that we can
do it from a safe distance.

1:20:08.891 --> 1:20:11.545
Come on, son. We're cowboys,
just like your dad.

1:20:26.734 --> 1:20:29.389
The place they're going to
is very dangerous.

1:21:05.556 --> 1:21:06.949
Oh, God.

1:21:35.281 --> 1:21:37.153
Find me an East route
or we're gonna lose it.

1:21:37.153 --> 1:21:38.371
No, we're too close.

1:21:38.371 --> 1:21:40.896
We're not too close.
East route, now!

1:21:44.943 --> 1:21:47.250
It's very bumpy.

1:21:47.250 --> 1:21:49.861
There's no pavement
for another two miles.

1:21:49.861 --> 1:21:51.558
I don't need pavement.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:57.347
They feel
this is the correct route.

1:22:03.831 --> 1:22:06.530
Always follow the good air.

1:22:06.530 --> 1:22:08.967
Get your phones ready.

1:22:08.967 --> 1:22:11.578
Oh, no.

1:22:16.148 --> 1:22:18.542
They're driving recklessly.

1:22:29.814 --> 1:22:32.469
Our escape route
is around the bend,

1:22:32.469 --> 1:22:34.688
about one mile. Highway 33.

1:22:34.688 --> 1:22:36.212
Now's your chance. Let's go.

1:22:40.303 --> 1:22:41.782
We're inside.

1:22:43.915 --> 1:22:46.048
Major Tom, why don't you put
your headphones on

1:22:46.048 --> 1:22:47.745
and find me a pulse.

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:55.013
Don't be scared.

1:22:55.013 --> 1:22:58.016
We haven't lost anyone yet.

1:22:58.016 --> 1:23:00.105
Leave me alone. Yeah.

1:23:33.095 --> 1:23:35.053
Just keep your eyes
up there, you understand?

1:23:35.053 --> 1:23:36.359
Oh, no.

1:23:38.056 --> 1:23:40.754
Hey, never mind that,
it's just the RFD.

1:23:42.060 --> 1:23:43.931
Where the hell you going?

1:24:43.730 --> 1:24:44.992
Get in!

1:24:44.992 --> 1:24:46.907
And close that door!

1:24:51.869 --> 1:24:54.219
Hey, Roy. Please come in.
Do you copy?

1:24:54.219 --> 1:24:57.309
We're on a dirt road
about a mile west of Exit 33.

1:24:59.050 --> 1:25:00.356
Let's go.

1:25:00.356 --> 1:25:02.314
-  Go forward!

1:25:02.314 --> 1:25:03.620
Hey, I'm gonna push.

1:25:06.144 --> 1:25:08.407
You drive.
I'll get out and push.

1:25:08.407 --> 1:25:10.192
When I give you the thumbs up,

1:25:10.192 --> 1:25:12.107
you start to ease back.

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.412
Okay?

1:25:41.179 --> 1:25:43.181
Keep it spinning.
Keep it spinning.

1:25:49.013 --> 1:25:51.320
Come on.
Come on!

1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:53.713
-  Come on!

1:25:58.979 --> 1:26:00.111
Oh, my God.

1:26:33.144 --> 1:26:34.232
No!

1:26:34.232 --> 1:26:36.756
Get in. Get in.

1:26:36.756 --> 1:26:38.758
Reverse! Reverse!

1:26:38.758 --> 1:26:41.239
Ah! Can you even drive?

1:26:41.239 --> 1:26:43.415
I absolutely cannot!

1:26:49.639 --> 1:26:51.206
Heads down!

1:27:01.781 --> 1:27:04.349
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

1:27:04.349 --> 1:27:06.177
<i>You're in the Bear's Cage!</i>

1:27:13.184 --> 1:27:15.491
<i>We're heading down 33!</i>

1:27:15.491 --> 1:27:18.145
<i>- Which mile marker are you on?</i>
- I'm going backwards here.

1:27:18.145 --> 1:27:19.669
How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

1:27:28.634 --> 1:27:31.071
Brake! Brake!

1:27:39.166 --> 1:27:41.517
- William!
- Mom?

1:27:46.130 --> 1:27:48.088
- Mom!
-  Move over.

1:27:52.136 --> 1:27:54.094
-  <i>Follow us.</i>

1:28:01.493 --> 1:28:03.103
Where's Zane?

1:28:04.496 --> 1:28:05.845
Why were you driving?

1:28:07.673 --> 1:28:09.501
The tornado was
right on top of us.

1:28:13.375 --> 1:28:15.290
It's okay.

1:28:15.290 --> 1:28:18.249
I'm here with you now.
It's okay.

1:28:20.599 --> 1:28:21.774
Hey.

1:28:23.341 --> 1:28:24.951
It's gonna be all right.

1:28:24.951 --> 1:28:26.779
<i>South storm
ate the North storm.</i>

1:28:26.779 --> 1:28:28.564
The low-level jet
just kicked in.

1:28:31.436 --> 1:28:33.656
Well, at least
it's stopped raining.

1:28:33.656 --> 1:28:35.135
That's good, right?

1:28:35.135 --> 1:28:36.311
No.

1:28:38.835 --> 1:28:40.358
<i>We're still in the cage.</i>

1:28:40.358 --> 1:28:41.838
<i>If we get through McCook,</i>

1:28:41.838 --> 1:28:43.448
<i>we got a South route,
two miles.</i>

1:28:47.409 --> 1:28:50.325
That... that whole thing's
a tornado?

1:28:57.984 --> 1:29:00.335
Mom. Fuel, we're low.

1:29:00.335 --> 1:29:03.773
Forget the South route.
We need a shelter now.

1:29:03.773 --> 1:29:05.905
- The Victory Christian Academy,

1:29:05.905 --> 1:29:08.386
it's two blocks North,
three blocks East.

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:24.184
Where is it, Roy?

1:29:24.184 --> 1:29:25.534
Hey, over there.

1:29:25.534 --> 1:29:27.362
- Turn around! Turn around!
-  <i>On it.</i>

1:29:40.679 --> 1:29:42.377
<i>We're out of gas.</i>

1:29:43.943 --> 1:29:45.380
You all right?

1:29:50.385 --> 1:29:53.910
Harper! Take this. Get inside.

1:29:59.568 --> 1:30:01.091
Tour is over. Let's go.

1:30:01.091 --> 1:30:04.660
Please move! Let's go.

1:30:06.966 --> 1:30:08.925
-  Come on!

1:30:12.058 --> 1:30:14.452
No, no. Come on.

1:30:15.714 --> 1:30:16.889
What are you doing?

1:30:16.889 --> 1:30:18.238
Dad's journal is under the seat.

1:30:18.238 --> 1:30:19.544
What? What?

1:30:26.203 --> 1:30:27.334
Get in here!

1:30:27.334 --> 1:30:28.901
Is Will in there?

1:30:28.901 --> 1:30:30.512
There's no time for that.

1:30:30.512 --> 1:30:33.123
- No, I can't leave it.
- Look, hey! Let it go.

1:30:35.995 --> 1:30:37.170
I'm stuck.

1:30:37.170 --> 1:30:39.042
-  What?
-  I'm stuck.

1:30:43.525 --> 1:30:45.178
It's your watch! Your watch!

1:30:45.178 --> 1:30:47.050
Undo it! Undo it!

1:30:47.050 --> 1:30:48.834
- Come on. Undo it.
-  It's stuck.

1:30:48.834 --> 1:30:50.140
Will!

1:30:56.276 --> 1:30:57.974
Will!

1:30:59.541 --> 1:31:02.195
Come inside! You're gonna die.

1:31:04.284 --> 1:31:05.416
Roy!

1:31:05.416 --> 1:31:06.809
Where are you going?

1:31:11.422 --> 1:31:12.597
-  Will!

1:31:12.597 --> 1:31:14.381
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:31:14.381 --> 1:31:17.515
-  I think
I broke something.
-  You okay?

1:31:17.515 --> 1:31:19.735
You're gonna make it.

1:31:21.867 --> 1:31:23.608
Oh, my God.

1:31:27.743 --> 1:31:29.135
The pool.

1:31:34.401 --> 1:31:36.969
All right. All right.

1:31:42.758 --> 1:31:45.543
Hold your breath.
Hold your breath.

1:32:20.709 --> 1:32:22.624
On my count, ready?

1:32:22.624 --> 1:32:25.844
- One, two, three.

1:32:37.377 --> 1:32:39.249
How'd y'all plan on
getting home?

1:32:40.076 --> 1:32:41.686
I don't know.

1:32:41.686 --> 1:32:43.079
Haven't thought about it.

1:33:04.579 --> 1:33:06.406
Well, at least you know
how to drive now.

1:33:56.282 --> 1:33:57.588
I lost it.

1:33:59.503 --> 1:34:00.765
We can build another.

1:34:02.637 --> 1:34:04.639
Your dad would be proud.

1:34:06.031 --> 1:34:07.467
I did it for you.
