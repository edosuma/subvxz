WEBVTT

00:19.102 --> 00:22.063
Thanks again for driving me.
Ubers were surging.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.483
I Uber everywhere,
so I'm usually in the back.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.110
Yeah, so which one is your place?

00:27.110 --> 00:30.989
Oh, don't worry, I'll tell you.
Sorry, what was I saying?

00:30.989 --> 00:34.409
Oh, yeah, so have you heard
of portable parking?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.037
- Uh, no.
- Good.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.915
'Cause it's this idea me and the boys
have been kicking around.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.500
The problem with driving

00:42.500 --> 00:45.086
is that you always have to find parking,

00:45.086 --> 00:49.591
but with ParKing,
you can order someone to park for you.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.510
You mean like valet?

00:52.510 --> 00:54.220
No, no, ParKing.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.724
So, basically,
they come to wherever you are--

00:57.724 --> 01:00.351
Sorry, you missed the--
You have to go back.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.772
- My bad.
- Okay.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.943
- Is this it? This is your place?
- Yeah, right here.

01:08.943 --> 01:09.986
All right.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.654
Home sweet home.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.742
I like the way you drive.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.786
It's... smooth.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.455
Oh, well, thanks.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.214
So, you wanna hang out this week?

01:30.381 --> 01:33.760
Uh, you know,
I have to go to Vegas for work.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.178
- So...
- Oh, cool, okay.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.013
- Vegas. That's cool.
- Yeah.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.015
My boy lives in Vegas.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.392
- You into MMA? Mixed Martial Arts?
- Mm-mm.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.311
My boy, he's about to pop off.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.229
He's like solid.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.689
I came up with his nickname,
"The Japanese Disease."

01:46.689 --> 01:48.942
I know it sounds like--
You don't have to...

01:48.942 --> 01:49.859
Oh, it's okay.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.778
I don't want to block anybody.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.029
- Oh!
- Sorry.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.364
That's okay.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.783
Okay, well...

01:56.783 --> 02:00.703
Wanna come in? My brother's probably home,
but I have a lock on my door.

02:00.703 --> 02:04.207
Paul, could you do me a favor
and not like tell anybody about this?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.875
You have a boyfriend, huh?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.003
Uh, no. Not a boyfriend, exactly.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.880
- An ex?
- Paul, I'm married.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.340
Yeah, I...

02:12.340 --> 02:15.927
Look, you seem like
a really good kid. And, um...

02:17.178 --> 02:18.263
Come here.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.020
Fuck!

02:32.861 --> 02:34.487
Go, go, go now before, um...

02:35.238 --> 02:36.948
Before I do something stupid.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.600
Are you sure I can park here?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.227
Totally. You might get a ticket, though.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.568
I was thinking I was gonna
call that road rage lady and apologize.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.236
You want my advice?

03:15.236 --> 03:16.404
Fuck that.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.450
I mean, God blessed me
with this church gig.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.410
What would Jesus do, you know?

03:22.410 --> 03:23.745
Jesus?

03:23.745 --> 03:26.497
Jesus would thank his cousin
with a fucking table dance,

03:26.497 --> 03:28.583
some fish, some unleavened bread.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.003
Of course, man. Thank you.
Really, thank you, thank you.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.840
Yo, it's right over here.
My guy gave me the code. It's 69-69.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.841
Word.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.802
I gotta make things right
with Paul too.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.263
All he cares about is that Kayla chick.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.891
Dude, I checked out her IG.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.435
- She's fucking hot.
- Nah, man.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.355
Yo, I don't fuck with
that type of white woman.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.067
They act like they got no power,
they got all of it.

03:54.067 --> 03:54.984
You met her?

03:54.984 --> 03:56.861
I don't need to, I just know.

03:56.861 --> 04:00.156
When Paul is cleaning his room,
white devil pulling strings.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.991
What white girls you fuck with, then?

04:01.991 --> 04:03.660
- Italians, bro.
- What?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.329
Yeah, they're the same as us.
Peninsula mentality.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.373
Yo, peninsulas, that's what's up.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.415
Yeah, man.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.293
Paul thinks he's thinking for himself,
he's being incepted.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.379
- Yo, you gotta tell him.
- Dude...

04:14.379 --> 04:18.049
he doesn't do well with criticism.
I gotta change things up.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.386
- I don't wanna lose him forever.
- Here we go.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.681
Everything you need for the church.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.307
Jackpot.

04:27.016 --> 04:30.937
Whoa. Wait. So we can steal all this
and pocket the church money?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.273
God is good. Amen.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.525
Yo, we should take this too, man.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.776
It's Daewoo.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.861
Support Korean manufacturing.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.489
- Hey, you know who you are?
- Hmm.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.241
You're Korean Robin Hood.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.325
Oh, yeah?

04:44.909 --> 04:46.327
And I'm Korean Aladdin.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.291
Yeah. I like that.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.461
No, Mommy, no!
- Junie, hey...

04:55.461 --> 04:58.548
Junie, it's gonna be a family trip
and it's gonna be fun, okay?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.341
I got it.
- I don't wanna go!

05:00.341 --> 05:03.094
Sweetie, the driver is gonna take us
to a private jet.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.054
Did you bring her Rubble toy?

05:05.054 --> 05:07.390
Zuma and Cap'n Turbot
can't patrol without Rubble.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.975
I think it's under her suitcase.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.313
It's PAW Patrol. You need all the paws.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.107
- Do we have any candy to bribe her?
- Sweetie, look!

05:16.107 --> 05:17.191
Look, look!

05:17.191 --> 05:18.735
PAW Patrol's coming too!

05:19.402 --> 05:21.154
Okay. Come on, Junie, let's go.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.197
Rubble will lead us to Vegas.
- No, Mommy!

05:23.197 --> 05:24.741
- No, no, no!
Junie, stop that!

05:27.660 --> 05:29.620
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

05:29.620 --> 05:31.581
Baby, I'm so sorry.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.627
- Oh, baby. It's okay...
- Maybe we just don't go to Vegas.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.380
I'll call Jordan
and tell her it was a work emergency.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.715
Babe, stop.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.883
You gotta go.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.261
I'll hold down the fort.

05:46.304 --> 05:51.100
I really thought this would help us
refocus on one another, you know?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.268
Well...

05:52.268 --> 05:54.020
Don't worry about us.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.565
We'll do our family trips
when you iron out the deal.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.527
Any time you want to meet Toni Kukoc,
I can make that happen.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.321
- What?
- That fucker owes me.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.740
How did I not know
you have connections like this?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.992
'Cause you never fucked
with your cousin till now.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.452
It's about time we hung out.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.579
Do you think I can take him one-on-one?

06:11.579 --> 06:13.664
- I can take him.
- Yeah. That guy's old.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.666
- You got your twenties bod.
- Right?!

06:15.666 --> 06:18.836
- Yo, I fixed that.
- Oh, sick.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.047
What up?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.257
- I could beat all of y'all.
What?

06:23.257 --> 06:26.928
- Paul knows how to read? Fuck, dude.
Say hi to your cousin.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.973
- 'Sup, Isaac.
-"'Sup, Isaac"? Issac-<i>hyung,</i> bitch.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.684
I don't make these gook rules.
Get up, you bow-legged fuck.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.354
Give me a front hug.
None of that side hug.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.397
- Tip to tip, come on.
Don't say that.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.525
Oh, fuck, it's so strong.

06:40.525 --> 06:44.362
- Isaac, you want some orange juice?
- Ooh. Sunny D. "D" for Danny.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.281
- Danny, I gotta ask a favor.
- Shit. Here we go.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.076
Dude, no.
I'm not unclogging it again. No way.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.496
- Can I borrow your truck?
- What you need my truck for?

06:53.496 --> 06:56.874
- To see my girl in Vegas.
She's your girl now?

06:57.667 --> 06:58.668
Yeah.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.880
- Okay, I mean, have you even met her yet?
- Actually, we have met. So...

07:02.880 --> 07:06.008
How about a boys' trip to Vegas?
You, me and Isaac.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.594
- Boys' trip!
- I don't wanna be sad in Vegas.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.847
She hit you up
for your credit card numbers yet?

07:10.847 --> 07:14.392
- No, but she did ask me for this dick.
- Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.811
- I'm sure you saw plenty in jail.
- The fuck you say?

07:16.811 --> 07:17.979
I'm kidding!
- Hey.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.106
- What the fuck you say?
- We're good. Hey!

07:20.106 --> 07:22.817
- Hey, Isaac! Isaac! Stop, stop.
- You wanna see some fucking <i>gochu?</i>

07:22.817 --> 07:24.777
- Stop, stop.
- Fucking bitch. Apologize.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.739
- Everybody chill. It's all good.
- I'm just joking, relax.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.577
Okay. Don't say stupid shit. Goddamn.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.706
Hey, dude we got that big job
at Veronica's church.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.709
So you can, like, come help
and I'll pay you good.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.627
Pay your own way to Vegas.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.130
Okay.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.840
- Okay.
- I appreciate that.

07:47.675 --> 07:51.721
Yo, why don't we celebrate the new job?
Let's take a shot.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.266
Chosen Ones!

07:59.896 --> 08:02.064
- Do you guys want more?
- It's good.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.775
- Danny, you good, or...?
- No, come on, you fucking bitch.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.694
Let's go! Chase it with the Sunny D.

08:08.112 --> 08:11.407
- Chosen Ones, here we go!
- Chosen Ones!

08:24.754 --> 08:26.881
Jordan, this is amazing.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.800
I've never had a whole spa
to myself before.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.469
That's so cute.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.098
Make sure you get the 99 finger massage.

08:36.098 --> 08:39.936
Ten of the best masseuses in the world,
and they massage everything.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.021
Ninety-nine?

08:42.021 --> 08:44.440
I'm so sorry your family couldn't come.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.234
Junie was not having it.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.236
We usually bribe her with candy,

08:48.236 --> 08:50.696
but the doctor said
to cut down on her sugar. So...

08:50.696 --> 08:53.533
Oh. That's life, right?
- Yeah.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.245
I mean, I have more money
than actual countries.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.956
But I need to let loose
behind closed doors.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.917
Wait. You don't go out in Vegas?

09:02.917 --> 09:06.254
Honey, most of our employees
are middle class.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.465
They don't like to see me enjoying myself.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.218
That's why I have to dress down
for conferences.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.928
Smart.

09:14.428 --> 09:18.182
You have to keep up the illusion,
people always prefer it to reality.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.475
That's just the way it is.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.019
But doesn't that get tiring?

09:22.019 --> 09:24.146
Yes, it's exhausting.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.943
That's why I have a zero filter policy
with my inner circle.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.404
If I had to fake it all day,
I'd go insane.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.738
Right.

09:32.738 --> 09:36.576
Jordi, the board wants to meet
by the Jacuzzi to go over things.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.580
Amy, we should leave them to it.
All the wives are going to a show later.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.166
- Actually, I think Amy should stay. Right?
Oh.

09:45.001 --> 09:45.835
Oh.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.255
Okay, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.049
- Amy, text me later. We'll meet up.
- For sure.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.469
You still wanted to talk
to the board about the deal?

09:55.469 --> 09:59.181
Oh, it can wait. It's the first night.
I don't want to bother.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.648
Paul, grab your phone!

10:14.405 --> 10:15.823
What the fuck?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.759
Oh, shit.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.889
Chair's still on.
I dreamt I was inside my mom.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.808
Hey, what's wrong?

10:42.808 --> 10:45.436
Oh, no, Paul took the keys.

10:46.020 --> 10:46.937
What?

10:46.937 --> 10:50.191
Fuck. All that shit we took
is still in the truck.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.319
<i>Wow, so you got to meet the board?</i>

10:53.319 --> 10:54.987
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

10:54.987 --> 10:59.283
I mean, they picked my brain about like,
a lot of confidential things.

10:59.283 --> 11:03.037
Then... Oh, God, they asked me
to speak at this panel tomorrow.

11:03.037 --> 11:07.583
<i>Babe, that's amazing.
Did you discuss the offer?</i>

11:07.583 --> 11:12.421
- No, we didn't have time for that tonight.
<i>- Oh, well, you'll find a window soon.</i>

11:13.089 --> 11:15.132
<i>It's good you're getting in
good with them.</i>

11:15.132 --> 11:17.051
<i>I bet they'll let you cash out.</i>

11:17.635 --> 11:20.221
Yeah, exactly. Tomorrow for sure.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.515
<i>Oh, who's that?</i>

11:23.391 --> 11:25.601
Oh, um, it's just Jordan.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.064
Um, so is Junie doing better?

11:30.064 --> 11:32.108
<i>She's so happy to be home.</i>

11:32.108 --> 11:35.820
<i>She hugged every piece of furniture
and told them how much she loves them.</i>

11:35.820 --> 11:38.197
Oh! Did she miss me?

11:38.739 --> 11:41.367
<i>Will they let you take the jet home early?</i>

11:42.701 --> 11:43.577
What?

11:43.577 --> 11:46.747
<i>Once you convince them,
you can come home, right?</i>

11:46.747 --> 11:48.165
<i>To watch June.</i>

11:48.165 --> 11:50.376
<i>Remember I rescheduled
my men's group meeting.</i>

11:50.376 --> 11:52.795
Oh, well, honey, remember,

11:52.795 --> 11:55.965
ah, um, they invited me
to speak at that panel tomorrow.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.925
- So...
<i>- Oh, right.</i>

11:58.467 --> 12:00.594
<i>Right. Yeah, you should do that.</i>

12:01.262 --> 12:06.642
Yeah, but, you know, maybe I don't do it.
I'm not prepared and... God, my hair.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.936
I need a haircut. So...

12:08.936 --> 12:12.356
<i>Well, I support you either way.
Just let me know, okay?</i>

12:12.356 --> 12:14.358
<i>'Cause, my men's group.</i>

12:14.358 --> 12:17.111
Yeah, I'll for sure
try to come home early.

12:17.111 --> 12:21.407
Hey, is someone there, George?
It's so late.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.951
<i>Mom and I are having a sleepover.</i>

12:24.493 --> 12:26.620
<i>Amy, I used your bathroom.</i>

12:26.620 --> 12:28.914
Oh, that's great, Fumi.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.792
<i>Shoot, I gotta grab her PJs
from the dryer.</i>

12:31.792 --> 12:34.503
<i>Love you. Get lots of rest, okay?</i>

12:34.503 --> 12:37.298
<i>They're gonna let you cash out tomorrow,
I can feel it.</i>

12:38.591 --> 12:39.675
<i>Mom!</i>

13:25.179 --> 13:28.307
So, your boy, he went home?

13:28.307 --> 13:32.728
Yeah, he had to train.
Gotta put the work in to see the results.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.190
Ah. I see.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.111
So nobody knows you're here, right?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.614
You didn't tell your brother or anything?

13:43.614 --> 13:46.825
- No, I barely even talk to him.
- Cool, cool.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.247
You want to put those flowers down
or something?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.415
Oh, yeah.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.797
- Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.

14:05.928 --> 14:10.057
Just-- If we're gonna hang out,
we can't do anything physical.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.227
I have a family, you know?

14:13.227 --> 14:15.688
Yeah. I wasn't even thinking about that.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.897
Okay.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.362
So, what do you want to do?

14:24.280 --> 14:28.158
Uh, I don't know.
I was thinking of putting on a movie.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.827
- Movie?
- Yeah.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.495
- Here?
- Yup.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.165
This place is amazing.
I know we can't be seen in public,

14:35.708 --> 14:38.627
but we can do something else
that's not so boring.

14:38.627 --> 14:41.130
Well, I just can't be hung over tomorrow.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.423
You know? So...

14:42.423 --> 14:46.010
- Do you smoke?
- Oh, my God.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.471
I used to, all the time,
before my daughter was born.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.600
- Why'd you stop?
- I don't know.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.060
I don't have the time or the space.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.855
Well, you got both right now.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.528
<i>Yo, you've reached Paul.
Don't be old, just text me.</i>

15:05.112 --> 15:08.616
Yo, all my shit is in the truck.
I need it for work.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.411
We're pulling up to Vegas.
Meet us. No harm, no foul.

15:13.746 --> 15:18.000
- That little shit, he's not gonna call.
- Ugh. We could do "Find My Phone."

15:18.000 --> 15:20.628
I know his crypto passwords,
one of them has got to work.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.589
That's why you smack them <i>maknaes</i>
or they turn out like this.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.800
They never get disciplined like we do.
Parents are too tired after the first one.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.471
Their oldest always gets it worse.
Every time.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.015
Hey, remember when I got you high
for the first time,

15:33.015 --> 15:34.934
and you puked all over the motel lobby?

15:34.934 --> 15:38.938
Yeah. My parents busted out
the Kmart <i>maemae</i> for that one. That hurt.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.482
Your vomit was pretty
because you love Skittles.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.484
I used to pour the Skittles into the Coke.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.903
- Yup.
- Paul used to copy me, man.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.615
He used to look up to me.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.952
He gave me that nickname,
Korean Johnny Carson.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.579
All the motel guests
started calling me that.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.206
Like, that was so good.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.793
Yo, you know he was
making fun of you, right?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.671
What? No, dude, Johnny Carson was the man.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.881
- What are you talking about?
- To us.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.133
Paul started calling you that
after he died,

16:08.133 --> 16:11.011
when all that stuff about
his temper and narcissism came out.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.433
Sorry, I would have told you back then,
but you stopped kicking it with me.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.354
Johnny was the best to ever do it.

16:26.735 --> 16:30.239
- I feel like you were a stoner back then.
- I was.

16:30.239 --> 16:35.411
<i>♪ Where is the ritual...? ♪</i>

16:35.411 --> 16:37.746
Yeah. Break down one of my arms.

16:37.746 --> 16:43.168
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.503
Squeeze it all.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.716
Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah! That's good. Oh!

16:48.716 --> 16:51.301
You ever put Skittles in Coke?

16:52.594 --> 16:54.471
I came up with this as a kid.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.764
It's amazing.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.850
Oh, shit.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.309
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!

17:07.026 --> 17:10.946
<i>♪ That's the day ♪</i>

17:12.156 --> 17:15.159

17:17.244 --> 17:19.246

17:21.790 --> 17:23.459

17:25.294 --> 17:28.005
<i>♪ Find a cure for
Find a cure for pain ♪</i>

17:35.137 --> 17:37.848
But I wasn't sure
if it was even real.

17:38.474 --> 17:43.479
I have this faint memory of going to China
when I was 6 and eating one.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.858
They told me it was illegal in America.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.736
I never even heard of a mangosteen.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.198
It's crazy
they just brought you one like that.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.495
You must be pretty rich
to be living like this, huh?

18:00.579 --> 18:02.081
Well, I'm about to be.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.375
That's so crazy to say.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.588
I'm about to sell my business
for $10 million.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.466
- What?
- Yeah.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.761
- From plants?
- Yeah. From plants.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.890
I would have studied plants.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.269
What does that even feel like? Ten mill?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.188
I don't know yet.

18:28.148 --> 18:32.653
I have to decide if it's worth working
nonstop for another five years.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.031
Fuck, yeah.

18:36.031 --> 18:40.869
I don't even need that much.
I'll take like... I'll take a milli.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.415
That's what I would have said
in my 20s too.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.543
But, like, in different words.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.212
Well, what do you say now?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.799
Now, I say that...

18:56.051 --> 18:57.511
It's not all about you.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.182
You sound like my brother.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.188
Your brother who you hate?

19:09.189 --> 19:12.317
I didn't mean it like that.
You're like the opposite.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.528
It's just, um...

19:15.779 --> 19:19.449
He works so hard for everyone but himself,

19:20.117 --> 19:22.077
and I see how unhappy he is.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.789
Why is he so unhappy?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.544
I think he's depressed.

19:32.921 --> 19:38.677
Like, all right, like,
he regularly drives an hour and a half

19:38.677 --> 19:41.680
to what he thinks is the best Burger King,

19:41.680 --> 19:46.935
just to eat four
original chicken sandwiches, alone.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.228
The long one?

19:49.563 --> 19:50.689
I guess.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.859
I just wish he'd leave me alone.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.739
I don't need that kind of energy
around me, you know?

20:03.619 --> 20:04.745
Yeah.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.499
It is selfish
for broken people to spread their...

20:11.376 --> 20:12.544
brokenness.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.676
You know how in video games...

20:20.469 --> 20:24.848
like, when other people die,
the game keeps going,

20:25.807 --> 20:30.103
but then when you die, it's game over?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.649
I think life's like that.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.234
Mm.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.195
Deep.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.696
Fuck you.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.950
All right.

20:43.659 --> 20:48.830
So then are you the main player?

20:49.665 --> 20:50.499
Or me?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.168
We'll find out some day.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.879
Oi. Oh, fuck.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.047
I got you.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.101
- I'm sorry.
- Who's that?

21:09.685 --> 21:14.398
Uh, nobody. I don't know why
it's doing that. I'll turn it off.

21:15.023 --> 21:15.857
Sorry.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.234
It's all good.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.287
This doesn't account for vertical,
he could be on any floor.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.414
I'm not spending all night
knocking on doors.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.292
I don't know what to do.
That front desk guy wasn't any help.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.545
- We can get a room and stay.
- A room? Fuck, dude.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.965
Why spend money on a room?
When we can make money on the floor!

21:39.965 --> 21:44.094
- Fuck yeah! My hand is scorching.
- I cannot lose any more money.

21:44.094 --> 21:48.682
You won't! Not with me man.
Life lesson, always sit with the Chinese.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.935
Blackjack, craps. You ever see
Chinese people play that game?

21:51.935 --> 21:53.603
Yeah, like all the time.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.732
Those are like half-Chinese.
I'm talking about real OG Chinese.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.483
They play on the edge of the casino.

21:58.483 --> 22:03.238
- You mean like Pai gow?
- Pai gow? Pai gyo, like gyo bros.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.742
They invented that shit,
they know the game better than the casino.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.244
Then you go. I'll keep looking.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.496
Dude, I don't wanna do shit by myself.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.791
Fucking hang with me.
I'll give you half my winnings.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.960
- Happy?
- No. I gotta look for Paul.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.629
We'll find that fucker,
he's here somewhere.

22:19.629 --> 22:23.884
Paul! See, we're looking.
Let's fucking make that money, dude.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.929
- I gotta find which room he's in.
- You're gonna knock on every door?

22:29.222 --> 22:31.183
Thank you for taking the couch.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.061
No worries. I get it.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.023
- Who's that?
- It's just your pillows.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.321
Hello. Thank you so much.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.782
- Have a good evening.
- Why she gotta knock like that?

22:46.782 --> 22:50.243
All right, Paul.
Let's get you nice and cozy.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.996
I could just leave now. It's no big deal.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.749
No, it's so late. You rest up.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.711
I'll have to leave
before you wake up tomorrow.

22:59.711 --> 23:02.255
But feel free to hang out
for as long as you want.

23:02.255 --> 23:05.300
- I'll leave you some cash.
- You don't have to.

23:05.884 --> 23:06.927
I'm not a kid.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.929
You gave me the exact night I needed.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.681
It was really nice
to do what I want for once.

23:12.307 --> 23:16.812
Just... consider this a thank you.

23:18.105 --> 23:18.980
Um...

23:20.607 --> 23:22.442
I feel like a whore.

23:24.027 --> 23:27.072
Keep talking like that,
you might get to sleep in the bed.

23:31.159 --> 23:35.831
Back to reality. My brother will be
so pissed I took his truck.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.585
Seriously, you're a great guy,

23:40.585 --> 23:44.923
and you'll be able to accomplish
whatever you put your mind to.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.553
Don't let your brother get you down.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.725
I'm really glad we met.

23:57.811 --> 23:58.770
Uh...

23:59.771 --> 24:00.856
Can we hug?

24:02.482 --> 24:03.608
Sure.

24:12.450 --> 24:15.579
God! Why didn't we look for Paul?
It's okay.

24:15.579 --> 24:19.082
First few rounds:
only high-value proteins, no carbs.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.834
No fillers. Learned that from you.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.294
I have zero appetite.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.589
I know you had a rough night,
but eat something.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.717
- I never lose. I never lose.
- I know.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.427
- It's Paul's fault.
- Okay.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.888
Kayla! Where the fuck is she?!

24:32.888 --> 24:36.266
Eat this. You need something
to absorb all that alcohol.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.435
- Dude, this is what I need.
- Okay.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.938
This is what-- No one ever
looks out for me. I needed this.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.983
Sometimes I know
what I'm talking about. Okay?

24:47.194 --> 24:48.028
Mm.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.489
Uh, that's an end piece.
I'll wait for a fresh one.

24:51.489 --> 24:54.201
- I'm an end piece.
- Okay, you guys can go--

24:54.201 --> 24:56.453
- If you want it--
I'll wait for another one.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.998
You guys wait for the good one.
Don't get that one.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.167
Oh, now he shows up.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.337
Oh, hey, Paul, get your ass over here.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.381
Yo! Are you fucking kidding me?!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

25:08.381 --> 25:11.051
Paul? Paul!

25:13.136 --> 25:15.680
Fuck! Come here!
- Don't eat those!

25:16.473 --> 25:17.557
Paul!

25:19.059 --> 25:21.561
Hi, I'm checking in for Amy Lau.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.397
Oh, you're a guest of Ms. Forster.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.441
All of your treatments
are of course comped.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.860
- Oh, my God.
- What did you have in mind?

25:28.860 --> 25:32.197
Oh, I actually have a photo
of what I want.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.701
Shoot, I think I left my phone in my room.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.621
- I'll be right back.
- Okay. No problem.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.754
Fuck! Why she gotta be on the top floor?!

25:47.754 --> 25:49.798
Paul, get back here!

25:55.220 --> 25:58.056
I'll fucking kill you
for making me work out!

25:58.056 --> 26:01.017
I won't be infected
by your brokenness anymore!

26:01.017 --> 26:03.937
What? See?
That's that white devil talking!

26:03.937 --> 26:05.522
Hey, Paul!

26:14.281 --> 26:17.492
Hey, is Korean Johnny Carson
a compliment or not?

26:17.492 --> 26:20.245
- I don't know who that is!
Was it a compliment or not?!

26:20.245 --> 26:21.746
What floor are we on?

26:31.631 --> 26:32.924
Wrong floor.

26:36.094 --> 26:40.598
You... have no loyalty, Paul!

26:40.598 --> 26:43.226
I don't give a fuck!
You're still on parole.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.185
Paul!

26:48.064 --> 26:51.568
Paul! I am your brother,
you will respect me!

26:56.197 --> 27:02.454
- Paul! Paul! Paul, get back here!

27:03.079 --> 27:05.874
- It was in my room, sorry about that.
- Great.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.876
- Let's get you all set up.
- Okay.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.545
Paul! Open the door.

27:10.545 --> 27:14.007
Open the fucking door, dude!
Paul, open the door!

27:16.343 --> 27:18.178
- Fuck!

27:19.220 --> 27:20.513
Where's your girl?

27:20.513 --> 27:23.516
Penthouse suite,
while I'm losing my shirt downstairs!

27:23.516 --> 27:27.103
- What are you doing?
Oh, God. Get off of me.

27:27.103 --> 27:30.315
Back in my day, kids flap their mouths,
they get sent away.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.319
The whole family in the mission fields.
Me? I got shipped to L.A.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.864
- What the fuck are you talking about?!
- I got the keys. Let's go!

27:37.864 --> 27:40.075
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.371
Why are you even here?
Nobody even likes you.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.207
I always wondered who
called the cops on me at the motel.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.085
It was you, you fucking snake!
You fucking spineless brat!

27:50.085 --> 27:54.255
We do not want child services on us,
all right? For hitting a fucking kid.

27:54.255 --> 27:57.926
It's pathetic you have to bully me
to feel better about your shitty lives.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.553
When you die, literally no one will care.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.848
Shut your fucking mouth.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.353
You wouldn't be here without me.
You're pathetic.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.524
I can fucking take you.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.986
Get the fuck out of here.

28:27.122 --> 28:31.584
Hope you're enjoying
the 52nd Annual Forsters conference.

28:31.584 --> 28:35.296
I saw our next guest backstage
and she's got a brand-new look.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.798
You look amazing.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.218
The owner of Kōyōhaus, Amy Lau.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.138
Yes.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.848
Give it up.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.643
How do we get to the garage?

28:48.643 --> 28:52.313
They make it impossible to get out.
That's how they keep robbing us.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.651
I appreciate all the love
for Kōyōhaus. Thank you so much.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.069
What the fuck?

28:59.362 --> 29:02.449
Shit dude, "Next Gen,
First Class, Future-Proof--"

29:02.449 --> 29:05.410
- This is the new X-Men!
- That's the road rage bitch.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.121
Fuck.
Oh, my God, what are the chances?

29:08.121 --> 29:12.292
Dude, universe, bro.
It wants you to balance the karma.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.086
- Yeah, let's do this shit!
- Wait.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.254
Come on.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.425
You know, the first year
we went direct to consumer...

29:20.425 --> 29:25.388
God, I was up at 6 a.m.
every single morning

29:25.388 --> 29:27.724
making deliveries all by myself.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.852
Like, all over Los Angeles.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.438
I had just given birth to my daughter.

29:34.063 --> 29:37.609
I'd pump in the car,
and we've all been there, right?

29:39.360 --> 29:45.033
But I still made sure
to have dinner with my husband,

29:45.575 --> 29:48.787
every single night,
because it was important to me.

29:49.662 --> 29:53.249
I bought a house that I redesigned myself,

29:53.958 --> 29:57.545
and, I mean, why am I telling you this?

29:58.755 --> 30:03.551
Because I want you to know that,
despite what everybody tells you,

30:04.469 --> 30:05.804
you can have it all.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.639
- You can.
Wow.

30:09.390 --> 30:12.602
I mean, just the perfect answer. Yeah.

30:12.602 --> 30:16.105
We have time for one more question.
Yes, there in the back.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.524
Let's get them a mic.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.568
Uh, yeah.
This is a question for Amy Lau.

30:20.568 --> 30:23.112
Oh, hi, nice to meet you. Ask away.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.406
I'm just wondering
what you would do in my shoes.

30:25.406 --> 30:30.036
I was sitting in my car, and all of
a sudden, this woman starts honking at me

30:30.036 --> 30:33.331
from her fucking perfect white SUV.

30:33.331 --> 30:37.752
And then this psycho starts trolling
my business with bullshit reviews.

30:37.752 --> 30:40.338
And then she fucking tags
my truck with, "I'm a bitch."

30:40.338 --> 30:43.842
Is that normal behavior?
'Cause that fucking lady...

30:43.842 --> 30:46.845
Security, I think some drunk tourists
have wandered in.

30:46.845 --> 30:51.015
Is that what that is? Do you think
that's having it all? Fuck you!

30:51.015 --> 30:53.810
Give me the mic!
"The Last Stand" is the best <i>X-Men!</i>

30:53.810 --> 30:55.728
Wolverine cannot be circumcised!

30:56.646 --> 30:58.940
- Get the fuck off me.
Oh, okay.

30:59.607 --> 31:02.527
All right. Last tip for your business.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.573
The average consumer loves alcohol.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.116
- I mean, clearly.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.285
- They do.
- She's right.

31:13.037 --> 31:17.125
- Get off me! Let me the fuck go!
- I know Miranda! I know Miranda!

31:21.337 --> 31:23.256
- Run, Danny!
- Come on, let's go!

31:23.256 --> 31:25.008
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Shit.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.092
Come on!

31:26.593 --> 31:27.844
Get back here!

31:27.844 --> 31:29.429
Motherfuckers, come on!

31:29.429 --> 31:30.638
Goddamn it!

31:32.307 --> 31:33.975
Yes!

31:33.975 --> 31:37.687
- Oh, my. You're more fun as a blonde.
- I want to stay on.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.981
Wow, what? Really?

31:39.981 --> 31:42.400
I know you probably planned for this--

31:42.400 --> 31:46.237
No, no, Amy. I'm only here to support you.
You know that.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.780
Thank you, really.

31:47.780 --> 31:53.244
I think that this is what has been missing
in my life. You know, this feeling.

31:53.244 --> 31:57.165
Yes! Yes, yes. Amazing.
Welcome to the family.

31:57.165 --> 32:01.961
Great job with the hecklers, by the way.
That's typical Vegas riff-raff.

32:02.462 --> 32:05.798
Pains me that
that's the average Forsters consumer.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.718
Well, hey, nobody ever went broke

32:08.718 --> 32:10.553
- underestimating the intelligence...
- Amy--

32:10.553 --> 32:12.221
...of the American public, right?

32:12.221 --> 32:14.891
I don't know why
he's so mad about a truck.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.374
- Where the fuck is the garage?!
- They make it impossible!

32:44.671 --> 32:46.881
- Where are my keys?!
- I don't know, you had them!

32:46.881 --> 32:48.967
- I thought you had them!
- I don't!

32:48.967 --> 32:51.135
Fuck! Where are the keys?!

32:52.136 --> 32:53.680
Put your hands in the air!

32:54.389 --> 32:55.306
Fuck!

32:55.807 --> 32:57.850
Hands on your head. Turn around.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.478
- Get down on your knees.
Fuck!

33:00.478 --> 33:02.480
- Fuck.
Get on the ground.
