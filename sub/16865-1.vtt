01:29.721 --> 01:31.963
Oh, man.

01:32.957 --> 01:36.738
I sure could use a Rocket Pop
right about now.

01:49.807 --> 01:53.176
<i>110 degrees, no food...</i>

01:53.276 --> 01:56.313
<i>a few drops of water
if I'm lucky enough to find it,</i>

01:56.413 --> 01:59.551
<i>but it still feels good to be back home...</i>

01:59.651 --> 02:02.286
<i>if this even is home.</i>

02:02.386 --> 02:06.925
<i>I can't tell what's real anymore...
because of him.</i>

02:07.025 --> 02:10.761
<i>He's a shape-shifter
with super-human strength.</i>

02:10.860 --> 02:12.797
<i>He enslaves the dead...</i>

02:12.897 --> 02:16.177
<i>...uses them to create terror.</i>

02:16.534 --> 02:19.737
<i>He has the power to channel time,</i>

02:19.837 --> 02:22.907
<i>dimensions, even dreams.</i>

02:23.007 --> 02:25.309
<i>He was a scientist in a past life</i>

02:25.409 --> 02:28.046
<i>who crossed the threshold to a red world</i>

02:28.146 --> 02:30.532
<i>and came back changed.</i>

02:30.632 --> 02:34.452
<i>His sentinels,
the brain's sucking spheres,</i>

02:34.552 --> 02:38.122
<i>have blocked every path I've had
at finding my lost friend Mike.</i>

02:38.422 --> 02:40.557
<i>The bastards are toying with me.</i>

02:40.657 --> 02:44.027
<i>I know they're here now,
somewhere, clocking me.</i>

02:44.127 --> 02:47.495
<i>This Tall Man,
he's taken everything from me.</i>

02:47.595 --> 02:50.902
<i>My job, my best friend Jody,
and now his little brother Mike</i>

02:51.002 --> 02:53.404
<i>who I swore to protect.</i>

02:53.504 --> 02:55.440
<i>They're gone...</i>

02:55.540 --> 02:57.542
<i>and I'm alone.</i>

02:57.642 --> 02:59.910
<i>It's just me now.</i>

03:00.010 --> 03:02.324
<i>My name is Reggie.</i>

03:19.096 --> 03:21.699
<i>But it's good to be back home,</i>

03:21.799 --> 03:25.670
<i>even if I am on foot now that some
fuck-wad jacked my Plymouth 'Couda</i>

03:25.770 --> 03:28.415
<i>that I left hidden in the desert.</i>

03:29.708 --> 03:34.946
<i>So I wander, following the Tall Man's
path of destruction,</i>

03:35.046 --> 03:39.594
<i>salvaging what I can
from the remains he's left behind.</i>

05:01.766 --> 05:04.469
Hey, you! Get out of the road!

05:04.569 --> 05:06.448
Asshole!

05:09.507 --> 05:11.914
Yeah, you!

05:23.421 --> 05:25.700
Can I help you?

05:26.157 --> 05:28.487
Give a guy a ride?

05:28.587 --> 05:30.294
Where're you heading?

05:30.394 --> 05:32.831
Down the road a piece.

05:32.931 --> 05:35.309
You got any money?

05:35.867 --> 05:38.146
I got money.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.517
Fifty dollars.

05:42.774 --> 05:45.167
You got it.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.957
Hey, the fifty.

05:59.057 --> 06:01.303
Oh, yeah.

06:18.576 --> 06:20.655
Nice jacket.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.414
Nice car.

06:23.514 --> 06:27.318
You don't see too many '71 'Couda's
driving around anymore.

06:27.518 --> 06:29.261
Ha, funny thing.

06:29.361 --> 06:31.686
I had one just like it.

06:31.786 --> 06:36.527
I had to park it on a desert road
while I took care of some business.

06:36.627 --> 06:39.330
Of course, mine had a chrome-plated 9mm

06:39.430 --> 06:42.066
loaded with steel-jacketed wadcutters

06:42.166 --> 06:44.946
in the center console.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.320
Oh, that's right...

06:54.845 --> 06:57.449
...it was in the glove box.

06:58.749 --> 07:01.770
Get the fuck out of my car!

07:31.282 --> 07:33.995
Thanks a lot, asshole!

09:58.296 --> 10:00.008
Fuck.

10:41.372 --> 10:45.641
Mike, what the hell? What's... What's...

11:09.700 --> 11:12.169
Where the hell am I?

11:12.269 --> 11:16.174
- You're safe.
- Yeah, I'm safe? Oh, that's good.

11:16.274 --> 11:18.476
I'm safe.

11:19.276 --> 11:22.546
Where am I safe? Where is this place?

11:22.646 --> 11:24.625
Reggie...

11:25.916 --> 11:28.196
Reggie, you've been my rock.

11:30.687 --> 11:35.089
When Jody died, you were the guy
that took care of me, and...

11:35.189 --> 11:40.597
- I will owe you forever for that.
- But why am I here?

11:40.697 --> 11:44.035
They found you wandering in the desert...

11:44.135 --> 11:46.414
like Moses.

11:52.009 --> 11:53.822
Mike.

11:58.081 --> 12:01.852
Buddy, I've been looking
for you for so long...

12:01.952 --> 12:03.437
- and now you're here!
- Yes.

12:03.537 --> 12:06.057
You're right here.

12:06.757 --> 12:09.292
But this is not right.

12:09.392 --> 12:12.473
Not here, this is not right.

12:12.796 --> 12:15.183
It's complicated.

12:15.283 --> 12:17.662
Okay, I'm listening.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.874
Come on, spit it out, Mike!

12:23.274 --> 12:25.499
Yeah, um...

12:25.876 --> 12:28.409
There's been a diagnosis and...

12:28.509 --> 12:32.873
you have dementia.

12:37.621 --> 12:40.571
- Dementia?
- Early on-set.

12:41.391 --> 12:44.495
But there's therapies
and there are treatments

12:45.595 --> 12:48.733
- and there's this beautiful place.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, Mike.

12:48.833 --> 12:52.169
- And we're together.
- Come on! You don't believe that crap, do you?

12:52.269 --> 12:56.324
- 'Cause you're not alone...
- Nah, this is just another one of his tricks.

12:57.275 --> 13:00.734
- Yeah, I see it all now.
- Right.

13:02.012 --> 13:05.166
Okay, listen, the doctor said
I'm supposed to keep you engaged...

13:05.816 --> 13:08.764
keep your mind active.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.190
So tell me the story...

13:13.290 --> 13:15.082
from the beginning...

13:16.327 --> 13:18.119
again.

13:23.233 --> 13:26.093
<i>The story's always the same, Mike.</i>

13:26.971 --> 13:29.606
<i>I'm tracking you.</i>

13:29.706 --> 13:32.510
<i>It starts with me coming back
through one of his portals</i>

13:32.610 --> 13:34.979
<i>from God knows where.</i>

13:35.479 --> 13:38.305
<i>I find myself deep in the desert.</i>

13:42.752 --> 13:45.085
<i>I get my car back,
and I'm feeling pretty good</i>

13:45.185 --> 13:48.248
<i>when I'm driving American muscle again.</i>

13:50.027 --> 13:53.630
<i>I keep to the back roads, small towns,</i>

13:53.730 --> 13:57.802
<i>those overlooked places
that nobody would expect...</i>

13:58.402 --> 14:01.104
<i>one eye out for those spheres,</i>

14:01.204 --> 14:03.630
<i>and the other for him.</i>

14:04.942 --> 14:07.514
<i>And like all good stories,</i>

14:07.614 --> 14:10.203
<i>it starts with a girl.</i>

14:18.389 --> 14:20.614
Okay, Reg.

14:21.792 --> 14:24.388
Boy, am I glad to see you. Oh!

14:24.488 --> 14:26.822
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone I knew.

14:26.922 --> 14:29.433
You mean, you know somebody else
that drives around these parts

14:29.533 --> 14:33.787
in a black '71 Barracuda? Far out.

14:33.887 --> 14:37.003
I'm really sorry I stopped you.
I thought you were a friend of mine.

14:37.103 --> 14:39.431
Well, you look like
you could use some help.

14:39.531 --> 14:44.615
It just kinda stopped working.
Do you know anything about cars?

14:44.715 --> 14:47.717
- Do you think you...
- Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

14:47.817 --> 14:50.551
I don't think I can help you with that...

14:51.321 --> 14:54.950
but I can give you a lift
up to the next town if you want.

14:58.995 --> 15:02.950
I'm not really in the habit
of getting into cars with strangers.

15:03.050 --> 15:06.559
- Well, hi, I'm Reggie.
- I'm Dawn.

15:06.659 --> 15:09.973
Hi, Dawn.
See, now we're not strangers anymore.

15:11.308 --> 15:13.800
Let me just get my bag.

15:34.632 --> 15:36.424
Let's hit it.

16:26.183 --> 16:28.842
Well, this is it. Home sweet home.

16:29.687 --> 16:31.512
Beautiful.

16:42.332 --> 16:46.737
- Do you live here alone?
- No. Actually, I have a farmhand, Demeter.

16:46.837 --> 16:49.974
- Demeter, huh?
- My parents were Bulgarian,

16:50.074 --> 16:54.534
and when they passed away,
he just stayed on with the farm.

16:55.078 --> 16:57.103
Got it.

17:15.232 --> 17:17.034
So...

17:17.534 --> 17:20.804
I'm still trying to make sense
of this story of yours.

17:20.904 --> 17:24.307
Well, it... it is complicated.

17:24.406 --> 17:26.810
So... there's these friends of yours,

17:26.910 --> 17:29.546
and then this big dude?

17:29.646 --> 17:32.495
- The Tall Man.
- Yeah.

17:32.595 --> 17:35.152
And you guy's have been
fighting him for years?

17:35.252 --> 17:36.977
Yup.

17:37.888 --> 17:39.780
Hmm.

17:44.461 --> 17:47.130
Well, it really is an amazing story.

17:47.230 --> 17:50.057
Epic, actually.

17:52.469 --> 17:55.262
I think I'm gonna go hit the sack.

17:57.140 --> 18:01.078
Hey, uh, you know there's, uh... there's
something I've been wanting to ask you.

18:01.178 --> 18:03.847
- Yeah, what?
- Well, uh...

18:03.947 --> 18:07.284
it gets hard on the road
and I just want to...

18:07.384 --> 18:09.180
Reggie, I think I see where this is going,

18:09.280 --> 18:11.979
and now I'm starting to think that maybe
you should bunk outside with the horses.

18:12.079 --> 18:14.892
No, no, no.
Yeah, don't get me wrong, okay.

18:14.992 --> 18:16.826
I, uh...

18:16.926 --> 18:19.863
and, um, well, I...

18:19.963 --> 18:22.425
I wanted to let you know that in fact

18:22.525 --> 18:26.102
I'm going to write you a song tonight.

18:26.202 --> 18:28.522
Oh, that's really sweet, Reggie.

18:28.622 --> 18:33.500
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Now you get some rest.

18:34.444 --> 18:39.206
Oh, and, Reggie... I really hope
you find what you're looking for...

18:40.784 --> 18:43.210
or it finds you.

18:52.296 --> 18:54.554
Wow, man.

18:55.299 --> 18:57.691
I sure hope not.

19:17.320 --> 19:21.447
<i># In the warmth of your mountain cabin #</i>

19:25.061 --> 19:29.068
<i># In the glow of a new-born song #</i>

19:32.401 --> 19:35.546
<i># Put my lovin' arms around you, baby #</i>

19:39.676 --> 19:42.502
<i># And I whisper your name #</i>

19:44.681 --> 19:48.775
<i># I... I whisper your name #</i>

19:49.153 --> 19:52.155
Hey, wow.

19:52.255 --> 19:55.282
Fuck, what did she say her name was?

19:56.793 --> 20:00.000
<i># As I whisper your name #</i>

20:06.970 --> 20:09.206
Hey, Reggie?

20:09.306 --> 20:11.598
I was thinking...

20:28.859 --> 20:31.151
Sweet dreams.

21:54.211 --> 21:55.669
You!

22:05.372 --> 22:08.374
I didn't notice you there.

22:08.474 --> 22:10.883
Do I know you?

22:12.629 --> 22:14.965
Name's Jebediah...

22:15.365 --> 22:18.858
been here such a long time.

22:19.369 --> 22:23.463
And what is your name, kind sir?

22:26.243 --> 22:27.294
Reggie.

22:27.394 --> 22:29.695
What brings you to this...

22:29.795 --> 22:32.065
God-forsaken place, Reggie?

22:33.214 --> 22:38.167
Well, I'm searching for my friend
and his brother.

22:40.290 --> 22:44.494
Oh, I've lost so many friends.

22:45.394 --> 22:49.856
And I'm afraid this body of mine
is almost finished.

22:51.101 --> 22:53.396
You know, Reggie...

22:53.496 --> 22:57.173
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of bad tidings...

22:57.273 --> 23:02.636
but I believe they bring us here to die.

23:03.781 --> 23:06.874
They? What?

23:09.853 --> 23:13.613
You'll never be safe.

23:16.826 --> 23:20.464
I'm always watching you.

23:36.479 --> 23:39.205
Wow, it's really early.

23:41.418 --> 23:44.077
It's like the crack of d...

23:46.990 --> 23:49.359
Dawn, Dawn.

23:49.459 --> 23:51.718
Her name is Dawn.

24:15.219 --> 24:17.421
Hey, Dawn!

24:18.221 --> 24:22.281
How would you feel about me
hanging around here a couple of days?

24:22.960 --> 24:25.395
Sure is beautiful here.

24:33.003 --> 24:34.862
Hmm.

24:39.609 --> 24:41.445
Dawn!

24:41.845 --> 24:44.239
Hey, are you awake yet?

24:45.916 --> 24:47.775
Dawn?

25:00.230 --> 25:02.100
Dawn?

25:12.376 --> 25:14.201
No!

26:45.903 --> 26:47.327
Hey.

26:55.477 --> 26:57.246
You need to shut the hell up, dude.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.908
Settle down.

27:02.008 --> 27:04.878
No, no, no, look, look. See, eh?

27:06.623 --> 27:08.515
See?

27:10.827 --> 27:14.698
Wait, wait, wait, you... wait!
You're Dawn's farmhand, right?

27:15.898 --> 27:19.001
Demeter! You're Demeter, right?

27:19.301 --> 27:21.038
I'm Reggie.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.549
Seriously!

27:54.855 --> 27:58.205
Dude, bad news about your horse.

28:21.330 --> 28:23.933
Will you shut the fuck up, please?

28:26.169 --> 28:30.149
No, no, no! Now you fuckin' did it.

29:27.230 --> 29:29.055
No.

29:46.449 --> 29:47.941
<i>Reggie.</i>

29:51.121 --> 29:53.423
Hey, Reggie.

29:53.923 --> 29:57.016
You still with me? Where'd you go?

29:57.660 --> 29:59.307
Some place else.

29:59.407 --> 30:02.288
It's all starting to run together.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.150
Hey, you got to listen to me, Mike.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.595
There's this threat. Have you seen it?

30:16.011 --> 30:19.315
Seems like I'm the only one
that wants to stop it.

30:19.415 --> 30:22.284
Well, you told me about it several times.

30:22.384 --> 30:27.124
You know the.... grave-robbing guy
from another dimension.

30:27.724 --> 30:31.160
He does seem like
a pretty potent adversary.

30:32.060 --> 30:35.087
You should know more than anyone else.

30:37.466 --> 30:40.904
I've been thinking a lot about what you've
been saying over the last few weeks.

30:41.004 --> 30:45.541
Seriously, you know, there are
some schools of thought out there,

30:45.641 --> 30:49.178
some philosophies, religions,
some quantum physics even...

30:49.278 --> 30:54.517
that suggest the possibility
that one can be in two places at once,

30:54.617 --> 30:58.354
along some kind of shifting time stream

30:58.454 --> 31:01.514
parallel universes,
you know stuff like that.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.663
There's this one theory
called membrane theory.

31:07.763 --> 31:12.231
It's the idea that thousands of universes
are all sort of spherically stacked

31:12.331 --> 31:14.637
against one another,
and ours is just one of them.

31:14.737 --> 31:18.631
At the places
where these universes touch...

31:20.943 --> 31:23.979
Uh, I'll just send you the book.

31:24.079 --> 31:27.449
Mike, you're not listening to me.
Books, I don't need!

31:27.549 --> 31:30.943
A fucking four-barrel shotgun
is more like it!

31:31.754 --> 31:36.326
Man, you are not listening to me!
Wake up! That son of a bitch put me here!

31:36.426 --> 31:39.512
He put you here too! Wake up, man!

31:39.612 --> 31:42.665
Don't get agitated. Okay?

31:43.065 --> 31:46.135
Please, just relax.

31:46.235 --> 31:47.970
All right?

31:48.070 --> 31:51.464
It's probably time
I should bring you back.

31:52.575 --> 31:54.872
Everything's all right.

31:57.913 --> 31:59.698
<i>Everything is all right.</i>

31:59.798 --> 32:02.091
<i>Everything's all right.</i>

32:32.148 --> 32:34.407
<i>Reggie.</i>

34:02.738 --> 34:05.197
I don't know, Mike.

34:06.075 --> 34:08.411
Do I want to die here...

34:08.511 --> 34:11.728
a crazy old man in some bed...

34:12.581 --> 34:16.219
my body eventually thrown in a box

34:16.319 --> 34:18.996
and stuffed in a wall somewhere.

34:19.956 --> 34:21.851
Rotting away to nothing?

34:25.561 --> 34:28.454
Or do I want to go out on my feet...

34:31.100 --> 34:36.291
shoving four barrels of fucking hell
down their goddamn throats?

37:01.484 --> 37:04.453
Our paths cross again.

37:04.853 --> 37:09.368
You've got me in some kind
of trap here, don't you?

37:11.560 --> 37:13.329
Where the hell is this?

37:13.429 --> 37:16.388
Not where, when.

37:16.966 --> 37:19.835
The year is 1979.

37:19.935 --> 37:22.504
The funeral home where first we met.

37:22.604 --> 37:25.141
You called it Morningside.

37:25.241 --> 37:29.111
In three days, your younger self
will attend a funeral here...

37:29.611 --> 37:33.359
and events will be set in motion.

37:35.351 --> 37:37.063
Right, yeah.

37:37.163 --> 37:41.190
You've tried to thrust yourself
in my way for years now,

37:41.290 --> 37:43.192
but what has it got you?

37:43.292 --> 37:46.662
You loved ones, all gone.

37:47.763 --> 37:51.733
You slaughtered my family.

37:51.833 --> 37:54.837
You... they're all dead!

37:55.037 --> 37:57.801
None of you ever listen.

37:57.901 --> 38:01.143
When the time comes, they don't die.

38:01.243 --> 38:03.269
They come to me.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.582
And your point?

38:06.682 --> 38:09.185
You want to see your family again?

38:09.285 --> 38:11.453
I'll give them to you.

38:11.553 --> 38:14.557
Your wife, your daughter.

38:14.657 --> 38:18.694
I could return them
to you alive, healthy...

38:18.794 --> 38:21.283
if I were so inclined.

38:23.132 --> 38:24.800
Where are they?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.320
But...

38:26.420 --> 38:31.307
I would require something
from you in exchange.

38:31.407 --> 38:33.475
And that is?

38:33.875 --> 38:36.846
I have plans to make things better

38:36.946 --> 38:39.248
for everyone.

38:39.348 --> 38:42.651
Just stay out of my way.

38:42.751 --> 38:45.321
Let the plan complete itself.

38:45.571 --> 38:49.275
I want my friend Mike back,
and his brother too.

38:49.375 --> 38:51.126
No.

38:51.226 --> 38:53.896
You stay away from him.

38:53.996 --> 38:56.466
He is mine...

38:56.566 --> 38:58.857
always.

39:02.070 --> 39:05.197
Perhaps you need time
to think this over...

39:05.508 --> 39:07.243
but be quick.

39:07.343 --> 39:09.903
There's little time left.

39:49.785 --> 39:51.677
Great.

45:02.498 --> 45:04.800
Have you considered my offer?

45:04.900 --> 45:06.901
Yeah.

45:07.101 --> 45:09.627
Go back to hell.

45:10.006 --> 45:12.158
Yours or mine?

45:12.258 --> 45:15.367
One might say we're in it together.

45:22.684 --> 45:26.445
Your playthings don't work here.

45:28.356 --> 45:31.660
You could leave
this rat race if you chose...

45:32.060 --> 45:34.662
and be with your family again...

45:34.762 --> 45:37.365
but my generosity is fleeting.

45:37.465 --> 45:40.402
You will have no more chances
beyond this moment.

45:40.902 --> 45:45.197
Do you think I want
your reanimated zombies?

45:46.141 --> 45:49.711
But I will take back my friend

45:49.811 --> 45:52.014
Mike and his brother Jody.

45:52.114 --> 45:56.251
If you free them,
I'll step out of your way.

45:56.351 --> 45:58.319
Why?

45:58.419 --> 46:02.311
Why are you so obsessed
with these two friends?

46:03.592 --> 46:06.261
You could never understand.

46:06.361 --> 46:08.820
It's called loyalty.

46:09.131 --> 46:12.534
Those frail human emotions again.

46:12.634 --> 46:14.237
Do you not understand?

46:14.337 --> 46:17.639
Your kind are simply
skin sacks of water and meat.

46:17.739 --> 46:21.810
And when a few random electrons fire off
in that puny brain of yours,

46:21.910 --> 46:25.837
you're ready to annihilate yourself
for this this feeble sensation

46:25.937 --> 46:28.894
you call loyalty.

46:31.420 --> 46:33.645
Like I said...

46:34.622 --> 46:38.527
Well, I guess it's time
for me to be going.

46:38.627 --> 46:40.928
You brought this on yourself.

46:41.028 --> 46:43.531
You're an unwanted pawn in the game.

46:43.631 --> 46:45.867
Your tenacity's amused me,

46:45.967 --> 46:48.703
and I've enjoyed your despair,

46:48.803 --> 46:51.874
but my use for you is at an end.

46:52.174 --> 46:54.776
You're not even real.

46:54.876 --> 46:57.703
You're my bad dream.

48:35.410 --> 48:37.469
What you looking at, baldy?

48:39.330 --> 48:41.089
I'm not quite sure.

48:51.026 --> 48:54.302
That one... could have been you.

48:58.767 --> 49:00.592
Dawn?

49:03.204 --> 49:05.725
No, no, it can't be you.

49:05.825 --> 49:09.444
I saw you sliced and diced...
in your own bedroom.

49:09.544 --> 49:13.449
I think you got me confused with
somebody else, buddy. My name's Jane.

49:13.549 --> 49:15.440
Jane?

49:17.318 --> 49:19.987
Okay, he is clearly delusional.

49:20.087 --> 49:22.124
Exiting sector six now.

49:22.224 --> 49:24.359
Meet you at seven.

49:24.459 --> 49:28.867
Wait a minute, Dawn. Don't you remember?
I stayed at your place.

49:33.068 --> 49:36.138
I wrote you a song. Uh...

49:36.238 --> 49:39.584
<i># In the warmth of your mountain cabin #</i>

49:41.342 --> 49:43.711
<i># In the glow of a brand-new song #</i>

49:43.811 --> 49:46.048
<i># I, uh, wrap my arms around you #</i>

49:46.148 --> 49:50.385
<i># Oh, baby, yeah,
and I whisper your name #</i>

49:50.785 --> 49:54.923
Dawn. Dawn, you got
to remember that, right?

49:55.223 --> 49:57.625
I'm sorry, I don't.

49:58.658 --> 50:03.365
Okay, we've just got one survivor, and we're
gonna bring him back to the bug-out spot.

50:03.465 --> 50:04.900
- Out.
- <i>Ten-four.</i>

50:05.000 --> 50:08.183
Look... we're here to help you.

50:08.283 --> 50:10.638
You were in those bars
for a really long time,

50:10.788 --> 50:12.978
and I think you're a little disoriented.

50:13.078 --> 50:15.610
We're gonna take you back
to a place that's safe,

50:15.710 --> 50:20.114
where we can get you some food
and medical attention.

50:26.321 --> 50:30.882
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Dawn, you're not
gonna leave me with this guy, are you?

50:31.360 --> 50:32.512
Well, baldy,

50:32.612 --> 50:36.368
you can either stay here with your brain
between those two chrome things...

50:40.101 --> 50:42.727
or you can bring your ass with me.

50:44.439 --> 50:46.345
And the name's Chunk!

51:13.935 --> 51:18.373
Yeah, I had my head between
those two things for like how long?

51:18.473 --> 51:20.921
Yeah, who knows for how long?

51:21.021 --> 51:23.785
It's like they just suck
everything out of you.

51:23.885 --> 51:27.185
Your hopes, your dreams, your memories.

51:27.285 --> 51:29.710
I was in one of those things
for a while too,

51:29.810 --> 51:32.587
but I got loose
with the help of some friends.

51:32.687 --> 51:35.781
He uses it to extract the intel he needs.

51:36.659 --> 51:40.028
- He?
- They call him the Tall Man.

51:40.128 --> 51:42.364
Ever heard of him?

51:42.464 --> 51:44.966
Uh, yeah.

51:45.366 --> 51:49.790
I mean, I don't know. I think I'm losing it.
I don't know what's real anymore.

51:49.890 --> 51:52.699
Just suck it up and deal with it.

52:09.524 --> 52:11.783
Stay put.

53:32.841 --> 53:35.297
- Hold still, grandpa.
- No!

53:52.826 --> 53:55.420
I hate these little motherfuckers.

53:56.331 --> 53:58.956
Yeah, me too.

54:00.001 --> 54:02.103
Quit lagging behind, baldy.

54:02.203 --> 54:05.007
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't you think I should have a gun?

54:05.607 --> 54:07.799
I don't know if I trust you yet.

54:10.111 --> 54:12.337
Oh, what the hell.

54:14.816 --> 54:17.275
Think you can handle this?

54:22.524 --> 54:24.692
Yeah, I'm good.

54:24.792 --> 54:27.118
Let's rock, babe.

54:43.344 --> 54:46.404
What the fuck? What? Why?

55:20.916 --> 55:22.267
Mike.

55:22.367 --> 55:24.086
Reggie.

55:24.186 --> 55:26.528
Oh, man!

55:27.288 --> 55:28.319
Oh, man!

55:28.399 --> 55:31.364
I've been looking for you
for so long, man.

55:31.717 --> 55:34.342
I've been looking for you, man!

55:34.630 --> 55:37.022
Is it really you?

55:38.066 --> 55:42.453
Your guys said I...
I've been asleep for years.

55:42.903 --> 55:46.207
You've been on ice for a decade...

55:46.307 --> 55:49.410
ever since we blew him up at the desert.

55:49.510 --> 55:53.148
- You remember?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:53.248 --> 55:55.717
Everything's different now.

55:55.817 --> 55:58.409
Nothing is the same.

56:00.488 --> 56:02.941
And we have a lot of catching up to do.

56:07.395 --> 56:11.062
- Yeah.
- We got a lot of catching up to do.

56:11.162 --> 56:13.201
Come on, man!

56:13.301 --> 56:15.102
- Right, man.
- Hey!

56:15.202 --> 56:19.157
Sorry to interrupt the love fest,
but, uh, we got to get out of here.

56:21.042 --> 56:22.643
Let's go.

56:22.743 --> 56:25.069
Come on, Chunk.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.498
Mike, I really want
to thank you and the guys

56:56.598 --> 56:59.701
for saving me
from that contraption back there.

56:59.781 --> 57:03.892
Man... it really feels good
to be back home again.

57:06.487 --> 57:09.591
Well, the thing about it is, Reggie...

57:09.991 --> 57:12.984
it's really not our home anymore.

57:17.332 --> 57:19.824
It's his.

59:24.392 --> 59:25.626
- Sir!
- Oh!

59:25.726 --> 59:27.829
We need to get you back to your room.

59:27.929 --> 59:30.915
- No, no. No, get your hands off me.
- Calm down.

59:31.015 --> 59:33.234
- Calm down!
- Get your hands off me!

59:33.334 --> 59:36.194
- Calm down!
- No!

59:53.487 --> 59:55.923
What's up with these things?

59:56.023 --> 59:58.493
Sometimes it's one of us.

59:59.026 --> 01:00:02.113
One of our guys goes down,
he reanimates them...

01:00:02.213 --> 01:00:04.517
and they get a lot stronger.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.475
Let's go.

01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:14.165
Snap out of it, baldy! Come on!

01:00:22.317 --> 01:00:24.085
Yeah.

01:00:24.185 --> 01:00:26.477
Hey, hold on.

01:00:45.606 --> 01:00:47.465
Reggie?

01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:52.303
Reggie!

01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:57.174
Bring him in here!

01:00:57.274 --> 01:01:00.154
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Hey, what's going on?

01:01:00.254 --> 01:01:03.247
- He's still delirious.
- Bring him in here.

01:01:21.142 --> 01:01:23.634
Get down! Get down!

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:45.973
Sir? Are you okay?

01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:51.548
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.

01:01:53.408 --> 01:01:55.833
You have a visitor.

01:02:00.515 --> 01:02:02.517
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

01:02:02.617 --> 01:02:04.919
I need to talk to you.

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:07.310
Do you mind?

01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:12.812
Mike...

01:02:12.912 --> 01:02:15.146
I'm... I'm having a problem, Mike.

01:02:15.346 --> 01:02:19.567
Listen, I had a dream last night.

01:02:21.667 --> 01:02:24.304
I can't get oriented.

01:02:24.404 --> 01:02:26.007
I'm slipping in and out of time.

01:02:26.107 --> 01:02:28.742
One minute I'm in the desert
and then I'm talking to you.

01:02:28.842 --> 01:02:32.145
You're telling me how I got
diagnosed and in this place.

01:02:32.245 --> 01:02:36.150
- Then I'm nuts deep in a war zone, man.
- That's the whole point.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.287
Reggie, I had your dream.

01:02:39.987 --> 01:02:43.547
That whole story you told me
about last week...

01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:47.262
We even killed one of those Tall guys.

01:02:47.362 --> 01:02:50.120
We blew him up with a hearse.

01:02:52.867 --> 01:02:55.726
It was a very real dream, Reggie.

01:03:00.374 --> 01:03:04.579
<i>You went after the Tall Man,
and I found myself in the desert alone.</i>

01:03:05.279 --> 01:03:08.533
<i>Following his path of destruction.</i>

01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:14.411
<i>I went looking for you with a gaping
yellow wound in my head.</i>

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.781
<i>Did he actually put something in there?</i>

01:03:21.461 --> 01:03:23.888
<i>Or was it always there?</i>

01:03:24.966 --> 01:03:27.112
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

01:03:27.212 --> 01:03:30.909
<i>I can still feel the connection...</i>

01:03:31.009 --> 01:03:33.090
<i>to him.</i>

01:03:57.331 --> 01:04:00.357
<i>If only I could find you, Reggie.</i>

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:04.421
<i>The world had changed.</i>

01:04:11.278 --> 01:04:13.914
<i>A full-blown invasion was underway,</i>

01:04:14.014 --> 01:04:17.585
<i>an all-out attack
against the world we knew.</i>

01:04:17.885 --> 01:04:21.055
<i>Governments collapsed. Society crumbled.</i>

01:04:21.155 --> 01:04:23.258
<i>An alien virus was unleashed.</i>

01:04:23.358 --> 01:04:28.562
<i>People were sick, and eventually,
their heads would swell up until they popped.</i>

01:04:28.662 --> 01:04:33.357
<i>The body count was immense
and there was no cure.</i>

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:36.127
It's bad shit.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.211
We tracked the source of the Tall Man...

01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:47.747
and we've been fighting him ever since.

01:04:49.317 --> 01:04:51.006
But...

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:55.089
You know, I'd never stop
looking for you, Reg.

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:58.649
What a fine use of our time that was.

01:05:01.428 --> 01:05:04.998
You know what?
I cannot tolerate this anymore.

01:05:05.098 --> 01:05:07.634
I'm done. I'm out of here.

01:05:07.734 --> 01:05:11.526
I'm done, okay. Just, I...

01:05:58.952 --> 01:06:01.812
Fire in the motherfucking hole.

01:06:20.007 --> 01:06:22.266
You have a visitor.

01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:31.909
- We got to go.
- We got to leave.

01:06:34.021 --> 01:06:36.857
- Mike, where're you taking me?
- He got Jane.

01:06:36.957 --> 01:06:40.785
Chunk went after her,
but he's gonna need our help.

01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:51.127
All right.

01:06:51.973 --> 01:06:55.566
Here, put this on.

01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:59.206
We going where I think we're going?

01:06:59.356 --> 01:07:03.624
Yeah, well, just... strap down
anything that's loose.

01:07:03.951 --> 01:07:07.554
- You know this is a trap.
- Well, I...

01:07:07.654 --> 01:07:10.614
we got him just where he wants us.

01:07:31.746 --> 01:07:33.782
Boy!

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:47.918
<i>My need for you is now finished.</i>

01:07:49.763 --> 01:07:51.622
Mike!

01:07:52.133 --> 01:07:54.221
Okay, then, let her go.

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:56.737
<i>That loyalty again.</i>

01:07:56.837 --> 01:07:59.426
<i>You can use your weapons,</i>

01:07:59.526 --> 01:08:03.544
<i>but all you destroy
is this flimsy skin sack.</i>

01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:07.915
<i>There are thousands of me...</i>

01:08:08.015 --> 01:08:10.216
<i>tens of thousands.</i>

01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:14.650
<i>I'm in dimensions
you cannot possibly imagine.</i>

01:08:18.024 --> 01:08:21.895
If you're so strong and powerful,
why haven't you killed us yet?

01:08:22.095 --> 01:08:24.363
<i>You were my subject,</i>

01:08:24.464 --> 01:08:29.770
<i>and you, well, every Tall Man
deserves an amusement.</i>

01:09:14.948 --> 01:09:16.841
No!

01:09:37.737 --> 01:09:42.499
Hey, Tiny, where the fuck
do you think you're going?

01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:46.029
Hey, guys

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.622
I got this.

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:58.682
Let's go! Let's go!

01:10:09.856 --> 01:10:12.706
Uh, uh?

01:10:12.806 --> 01:10:15.175
How the hell did he get out here?

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.151
<i>Reggie.</i>

01:10:29.523 --> 01:10:31.382
Mike?

01:11:25.513 --> 01:11:27.371
No!

01:11:43.029 --> 01:11:45.699
- Good to have you back, Reg.
- We need more ammo.

01:11:45.899 --> 01:11:49.536
- You got some shells?
- I got one.

01:11:49.636 --> 01:11:51.946
Let's go.

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:25.040
- Jody?
- How's it hanging, Reg?

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.308
A little to the left, I guess.

01:12:28.408 --> 01:12:30.967
- Come on! Get in!
- Okay, okay.

01:12:32.447 --> 01:12:34.671
Haul ass!

01:13:12.786 --> 01:13:15.111
Where is everybody?

01:13:17.224 --> 01:13:19.483
Nobody made it.

01:13:21.828 --> 01:13:23.686
Damn.

01:13:24.064 --> 01:13:26.823
It's just not getting any easier.

01:13:29.368 --> 01:13:31.661
It's so good to see you, Jody.

01:13:35.943 --> 01:13:40.128
What now? Where we gonna go?

01:13:40.748 --> 01:13:43.351
We're gonna fight harder.

01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:45.310
We'll fight smarter.

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:49.890
We're gonna change tactics.
We're gonna go north where it's cold.

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:51.928
Really cold.

01:13:53.093 --> 01:13:55.886
The bastard hates the cold.

01:13:56.897 --> 01:13:58.788
Yeah.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.723
I'm just so grateful to see you both.

01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:07.464
We did miss you, Reggie.

01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:11.412
You know...

01:14:12.812 --> 01:14:15.839
it's a hell of way to start a trio.

01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:18.569
Hey, bro.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.018
Rocky, thanks for waiting around for me.

01:18:18.118 --> 01:18:21.928
Hey, little man, Mike figured
you'd be back in one piece.

01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:24.969
Damn, you left a few on the other side.

01:18:25.069 --> 01:18:27.824
That's the great thing about a fireball.

01:18:28.735 --> 01:18:32.589
Amputation and cauterization all in one.

01:18:33.339 --> 01:18:35.075
Let's get to the rendezvous.

01:18:35.175 --> 01:18:39.069
Hey! Think I can hitch a ride?

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.392
- Really?
- What?

01:18:52.492 --> 01:18:56.896
Oh, come on, Rock, don't be like that!
It's just one hand!

01:18:57.196 --> 01:18:59.756
Ah, crap!

01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:29.553
- That'll do.
- Thanks.

01:19:32.316 --> 01:19:34.541
So, Rock...

01:19:35.769 --> 01:19:38.061
you and me...

01:19:38.638 --> 01:19:41.264
you know, any chance?

01:19:44.377 --> 01:19:46.183
Well...

01:19:46.483 --> 01:19:49.123
I don't see any other guys around.

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:52.108
You'll do for right now.

01:19:53.353 --> 01:19:55.712
I can live with that.

01:19:58.424 --> 01:20:00.757
Our ride's here.

01:20:13.673 --> 01:20:18.391
- How the hell...
- Oh, for the love of god, baldy, move over.
