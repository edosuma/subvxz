WEBVTT

00:06.465 --> 00:09.301
My name is K'tano.

00:09.426 --> 00:13.597
The once first prime of Imhotep.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.766
A false god.

00:15.891 --> 00:19.436
A false god who has died
by my own hand.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.648
Now I am free.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.692
I am a free Jaffa.

00:28.153 --> 00:32.406
If you have come to this place,
then you wish to know freedom as I do.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.621
If you've come to hear me, then you know
in your heart and in your mind

00:37.746 --> 00:40.415
that the Goa'uld are not gods!

00:45.504 --> 00:48.715
Still, I am but one warrior.

00:49.216 --> 00:53.387
Only together, we are an army of warriors!

00:53.512 --> 00:56.640
An army has weapons!
An army has food!

00:56.765 --> 00:58.725
In time, we shall have weapons,

00:58.851 --> 01:04.022
and enough food and drink to sustain us
for as long as it takes to achieve victory.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.652
Until then, we have our freedom.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.698
We have our brothers and sisters.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.992
I do not say that this will be easy.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.162
There will be sacrifice.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.791
But for each of you who dies
in the name of freedom,

01:22.916 --> 01:26.378
your soul shall be sent to Kheb,

01:26.503 --> 01:28.714
the place of freedom everlasting.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.177
Until then,

01:33.302 --> 01:35.762
if you seek freedom,

01:36.805 --> 01:38.849
if you seek sanctuary,

01:39.725 --> 01:42.853
know that this place is sanctuary.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.647
This is Cal Mah.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.985
I declare this world
a free world for all Jaffa!

01:51.403 --> 01:53.947
Let no Goa'uld challenge us!

01:55.365 --> 02:00.454
The time has come for Jaffa to claim
their rightful place among the stars

02:00.579 --> 02:05.083
as warriors who live
and as warriors who die free!

02:05.584 --> 02:10.297
What say you, Teal'c? Is he not
the means to our deliverance?

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.666 --> 03:29.710
"Deliverance"?

03:30.961 --> 03:33.755
Do you know what happened
to the guys in that movie?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.966
I do not.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.429
Master Bra'tac, that's
a very strong recommendation.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.808
Yes, it is. Yet the rewards
of such an alliance would be great.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.811
- Teal'c?
- Many of our allies have fallen, General.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.940
The Tollan may be gone for ever.
The Tok'ra are severely weakened.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.068
- K'tano offers an army.
- An army that needs our help.

03:55.194 --> 03:59.364
- Have not the Jaffa helped your cause?
- Teal'c, please don't misunderstand me.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.868
You and Bra'tac have done more for us
than anyone could ask.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.954
I owe you both my life.
That's not what I'm saying.

04:06.079 --> 04:10.250
What she's saying is, if this guy's come
to us, he's gotta be pretty desperate.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.295
We shouldn't underestimate
this opportunity.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.382
An army of Jaffa challenging
the power structure of the Goa'uld...

04:17.507 --> 04:21.928
It could inspire the Jaffa. Word of its
very existence is a threat to the Goa'uld.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.264
You think the Goa'uld will let it happen?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.807
We do not.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.435
Which makes K'tano's need so great.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.230
His army is drawn
from many different System Lords.

04:31.355 --> 04:34.483
More flock to him
with each raid he makes.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.277
But an army cannot live on courage alone.

04:37.361 --> 04:41.823
Dr Jackson, tell us about this Imhotep.
This is the first I've heard of him.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.992
In the third dynasty of ancient Egypt,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.995
Imhotep was credited
as the first pyramid builder.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.039
He was deified by the Egyptians,

04:49.164 --> 04:52.793
but among the Goa'uld
he never achieved power of any kind.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.711
He was never a System Lord.

04:54.837 --> 04:59.508
Imhotep was probably an insignificant
Goa'uld from a backwater planet.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.219
Which explains how K'tano
has managed to survive.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.430
- He took out a nobody.
- Which probably only buys us time.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.226
If we don't help, the Goa'uld will
see this as the threat it really is.

05:09.351 --> 05:14.439
Imhotep may have been a minor Goa'uld,
but K'tano is a great leader of men.

05:14.565 --> 05:19.486
I believe he will lead his army to victory
over those who would deny us freedom.

05:19.611 --> 05:23.448
I've already ordered food and
medical supplies for transport.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.952
What we need to discuss is
what kind of weapons and how many.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.247
Your projectile weapons
have proven effective in battle.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.708
P- 90s, MP- 5s, SPAS- 12s...

05:32.833 --> 05:35.043
For several hundred warriors.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.879
That may take some doing.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.716
General Hammond, if we may send
a smaller number of weapons,

05:40.841 --> 05:43.927
as a gesture of good intentions.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.559
I think we owe these folks... to a point.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.104
Very well. You have a go.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.656
O'Neill, you should know that some
of the Jaffa you are about to meet

06:04.781 --> 06:08.118
you may have met before, in battle.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.038
Yeah... I thought about that.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.998
The Jaffa have long memories.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.792
That's all right because... I don't.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.300
It's... It's a... joke.

06:28.555 --> 06:32.476
Master Bra'tac, let's hope your faith
in this man is well deserved.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.978
I would stake my life on it.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.360
Ours too, apparently.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.173
I am Master Bra'tac, of Chulak.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.718
I have come with warriors of the Tauri.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.560
Hi, guys!

07:15.811 --> 07:17.229
Tek mat'ek.

07:17.813 --> 07:21.024
It means "Friends well met. "
He's saying we come in peace.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.488
- Rak'nor.
- Teal'c. Tek mat'ek.

07:28.073 --> 07:31.410
It was Teal'c who gave me
my first taste of freedom.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.833
It is because of you I am here.
Tek matte.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.294
"Tek matte" is a greeting of respect.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.171
- OK.
- I'm just saying.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.839
- I don't care.
- OK.

07:46.758 --> 07:51.638
These are among the great warriors
of the Tauri. Daniel Jackson, Major Carter,

07:51.972 --> 07:54.183
and their leader, Colonel O'Neill.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.980
Tek mat'ek.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.773
Back at ya.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.068
Back at ya.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.281
- You've come to speak with K'tano.
- Yes.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.075
He's on a mission
and will return very soon.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.494
- What is this?
- The first shipment of many.

08:14.620 --> 08:18.165
We brought food, supplies,

08:18.290 --> 08:20.334
and last...

08:25.672 --> 08:27.424
weapons.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.851
- What?
- Your gesture is appreciated but...

08:37.976 --> 08:42.313
they had hoped you would bring
staff weapons. Zat'n'ktels. True weapons.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.234
- True weapons?
- It does not matter, friend.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.529
Come. See how our numbers are growing.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.495
You see, O'Neill,

08:56.620 --> 08:59.456
these Jaffa were once
sworn mortal enemies,

08:59.581 --> 09:02.626
each serving different false gods.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.795
Now they work in harmony.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.840
Our numbers grow
with each successful campaign.

09:07.965 --> 09:11.176
And you just trust
every new arrival to your cause?

09:11.802 --> 09:16.640
Isn't it possible that some of these Jaffa
are still loyal to their gods

09:16.765 --> 09:19.434
and are acting as spies
within your ranks?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.272
A warrior of K'tano's experience

09:23.397 --> 09:27.401
can see within the very soul of
another Jaffa and know his allegiance.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.403
Kind of a leap of faith, isn't it?

09:29.528 --> 09:32.781
No more than when Teal'c went through
the rite of M'al Sharran.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.994
I saw into his heart and knew
he no longer worshipped Apophis.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.329
That's not quite the same, is it?

09:39.454 --> 09:43.083
Our ways are different
to you, O'Neill. Accept that.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.576
This discipline is called Mastaba.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.787
All of Imhotep's Jaffa
were required to master it.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.707
And now we require it of ourselves.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.233
Bashaak. Training staffs.

10:49.358 --> 10:53.320
Out of necessity, Teal'c. There are not
enough staff weapons for all.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.244
You overcommit!

11:04.331 --> 11:06.708
This young warrior's name is Tara'c.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.589
- Tek matte, Master.
- If you would allow me.

11:16.051 --> 11:20.055
The weapon is balanced,
but the warrior is not.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.853
When one overcommits, one becomes
vulnerable to counterattack.

11:26.186 --> 11:31.984
When one achieves balance in combat,
one will survive to achieve balance in life.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.576
Forgive me, Master, but K'tano teaches

11:40.701 --> 11:43.871
that one must strike with
single- minded purpose to victory,

11:43.996 --> 11:46.790
without regard for one's survival.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.589
Show me.

12:07.269 --> 12:10.480
- Hey, easy, easy, easy.
- Leave them, O'Neill.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.576
Hey!

12:24.119 --> 12:27.623
- What the hell are you doin'?
- We are training.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.417
I'd call it beatin' the crap
out of each other!

12:30.501 --> 12:33.378
The boy's symbiote
will heal his injuries, O'Neill.

12:33.504 --> 12:37.007
K'tano teaches that we must be
willing to die if we are to be free.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.969
Well, if you all die, you won't
have an army. That's kinda stupid.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.513
- Kek mattet, kree!
- What?

12:42.638 --> 12:45.432
You insult our ways, O'Neill.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.018
- He is challenging you.
- Kek mattet!

12:49.770 --> 12:51.563
Yeah, just...

12:51.688 --> 12:53.982
Easy, stick boy. I'm just here to help.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.943
K'tano returns!

12:59.279 --> 13:02.491
Where... Where are you goin'?

13:28.100 --> 13:31.436
You know, we never get this
when we come home.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.362
Jaffa!

13:40.487 --> 13:45.075
This day, three of our warriors
have fallen in the name of freedom.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.912
They fought fiercely
against Zipacna's forces,

13:49.037 --> 13:50.873
and they died bravely,

13:50.998 --> 13:54.418
and have secured for themselves
a place in Kheb.

13:54.543 --> 13:59.423
So, too, have they strengthened
our ability to fight back at the enemy.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.679
True weapons.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.560
Tek mal tiak.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.479
- Tek matte.
- You flatter me, Master Bra'tac.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.486
Ya duru Arik kek Onac.

14:22.196 --> 14:27.284
I honour he who would kill his god.
And to his brethren of the Tauri.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.787
Slayers of Ra, Hathor, Setesh, Heru-ur,

14:30.913 --> 14:33.248
Sokar, Cronus and Apophis.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.668
Well! Somebody's been keepin' score.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.341
- Colonel Jack O'Neill.
- A familiar name.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.510
Cursed by every Goa'uld.

14:44.635 --> 14:47.971
Imhotep himself declared
your days were numbered.

14:48.430 --> 14:52.601
Well, that's fine. As long as
it's a really big number.

14:53.894 --> 14:58.607
Because of you, the armies of these
fallen System Lords now swell our ranks.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.319
- We owe you thanks.
- Tek mat'ek, K'tano.

15:05.489 --> 15:09.409
- We also offer an alliance.
- Then you are most welcome.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.954
And food and supplies for your people.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.872
Glorious!

15:17.417 --> 15:21.004
And, of course, weapons.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.300
Earth weapons.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.763
Take no offence, my friend, but your
weapons are primitive by comparison.

15:32.432 --> 15:38.188
Carter, I think a little demonstration
is in order. Don't you?

15:40.357 --> 15:42.234
This weapon is called a P- 90.

15:42.359 --> 15:46.154
It carries a 50- round, top- loading
magazine of Teflon- coated ordnance

15:46.280 --> 15:49.658
with a cyclical rate of fire
of 900 rounds per minute.

15:51.159 --> 15:55.497
- Who here can handle a staff weapon?
- Rak'nor is among our best marksmen.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.548
Carter, that target.
What... 60, 70 yards down?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.050
Give or take, sir.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.513
Fire away, son.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.870
Well done. Ta'i kree.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.793
Two out of three. That's... not bad.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.256
- Carter?
- The female?

16:47.007 --> 16:50.886
- Major Carter is a formidable warrior.
- Yes, of course.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.432
Actually, hold up a second.

16:57.518 --> 17:00.437
Hey, you! In the skirt!

17:00.854 --> 17:03.524
Get that target swingin' a little!

17:09.195 --> 17:11.240
A little more!

17:14.992 --> 17:16.954
All right. Step away.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.415
When you're ready, Major.

17:34.888 --> 17:38.725
Uh, Major, demonstrate
the weapon on single- shot.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.196
This...

17:51.905 --> 17:54.241
is a weapon of terror.

17:54.366 --> 17:58.453
It's made to intimidate the enemy.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.457
This...

18:02.583 --> 18:04.126
is a weapon of war.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.628
It's made to kill your enemy.

18:06.753 --> 18:12.426
And it's capable of doing so effectively at
five times the range I just demonstrated.

18:12.551 --> 18:17.556
We've used it to win skirmishes with the
Goa'uld and the Jaffa who served them.

18:17.681 --> 18:21.059
Those of you who have
gone up against us and survived,

18:21.185 --> 18:23.520
and you know who you are,

18:23.645 --> 18:26.106
you know what I'm talking about.

18:26.231 --> 18:30.652
We accept your gifts
with gratitude... and humility.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.406
Now, let us celebrate this new alliance!

18:40.162 --> 18:43.665
- They really like doing that, don't they?
- Yes, sir.

18:50.672 --> 18:55.052
Your weapons are formidable, yes,
but they lack the endurance of a staff.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.931
- We have these.
- You provide them freely?

18:59.056 --> 19:03.227
- Isn't that the purpose of an alliance?
- It gives you power over us.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.436
How so?

19:04.561 --> 19:08.190
If K'tano does not do exactly as agreed,
you may withhold ammunition.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.068
OK, first of all, Teal'c,

19:11.193 --> 19:17.032
as long as you're a member of SG-1, you
should use the pronoun "we", not "you".

19:17.282 --> 19:21.578
And secondly, we're not holding back.
We're offering the best we've got.

19:21.703 --> 19:26.041
Now, you can either take it...
or leave it.

19:26.166 --> 19:30.796
Of course. It is only concern
for my people that I raise these questions.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.716
- Your people?
- No warrior here cannot say "my people".

19:34.842 --> 19:38.595
- As I also have done.
- Colonel O'Neill fears I may seek power.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.974
- Well, you are gathering an army.
- And I lead.

19:42.099 --> 19:45.853
But there is no warrior among us
who cannot claim Joma Secu.

19:46.979 --> 19:51.066
- Challenge of leadership.
- To determine the victor's worthiness.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.695
- To the death, I suppose.
- Of course.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.656
Of course.

20:02.035 --> 20:06.957
Yeah, well, where I come from,
we do things... a little differently.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.376
You want us to change our ways
to suit yours?

20:09.501 --> 20:13.380
- I didn't say that, but if it's no trouble...
- K'tano.

20:13.922 --> 20:18.927
Colonel O'Neill, it is my hope that
we can learn from our differences,

20:19.052 --> 20:22.139
that they bond us together,
make us stronger.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.310
Your words are wise, Master Bra'tac.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.730
Yes. Wise indeed.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.816
Tomorrow we will bond, in battle.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.988
You are familiar with
the System Lord Nirrti?

20:38.780 --> 20:41.366
- Oh, yeah.
- Tomorrow we raid a supply shipment

20:41.492 --> 20:44.536
intended for a battalion of Nirrti's Jaffa.

20:44.661 --> 20:49.208
- Join us.
- If we do, what's... in it for us?

20:50.292 --> 20:55.047
- I see you speak your mind, O'Neill.
- Yes, which is why I don't say much.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.302
A share of the spoils.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.681
Spoils are good. We like spoils.

21:06.934 --> 21:11.647
Teal'c has informed me that
you require several hours of sleep.

21:11.772 --> 21:14.483
There is no shame in doing so.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.948
Gee, thanks.

21:30.207 --> 21:32.251
- Shal met.
- Shal met.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.881
Have you chosen to join us, Teal'c?

21:38.006 --> 21:41.009
- K'tano has yet to ask.
- He will.

21:41.134 --> 21:45.222
You will take your place
as a leader in the Jaffa nation.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.809
I have long dreamed
Jaffa would one day be free.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.812
But I fear that day is farther off
than K'tano believes.

21:51.937 --> 21:54.606
We have come so far
because of you, Teal'c.

21:54.731 --> 21:58.861
K'tano could not have hoped to raise
such an army, had you not led the way.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.320
Perhaps.

22:00.445 --> 22:05.367
And we will grow even stronger now that
the Tauri have become our allies.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.412
Of that I'm not so sure.

22:08.537 --> 22:13.083
K'tano's ways are... difficult
for the people of the Tauri to understand.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.670
We shall gain our freedom
with or without them.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.256
K'tano.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.469
- Forgive me.
- There is nothing to forgive.

22:24.595 --> 22:27.306
- I do not speak for O'Neill.
- What you say is true.

22:27.431 --> 22:31.602
They are different. Cynical of our ways.
O'Neill most of all.

22:31.727 --> 22:34.938
- Yet they are my friends.
- And we are your brothers.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.317
I am not a fool, Teal'c.
I know the Tauri are strong.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.569
An alliance can make us stronger.

22:40.694 --> 22:44.948
But I abandon nothing of who and what
we are, for neither human nor Goa'uld.

22:55.501 --> 22:58.837
I guess Teal'c's staying out all night
with his new buddies.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.257
Well, he did get in
all that quality kelno'reeming.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.511
What do you think?

23:06.345 --> 23:08.388
Of K'tano?

23:09.223 --> 23:13.101
You have to admit he's got presence.
His followers are almost fanatical.

23:13.227 --> 23:15.729
- "Almost"?
- It does make them formidable.

23:15.854 --> 23:19.566
Ancient Japanese feudal lords
recognised indifference to death

23:19.691 --> 23:21.735
as a very effective tool in battle.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.988
- What's with this "Jomo Sicko" thing?
- Joma Secu.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.157
Like anybody's gonna challenge him.

23:27.282 --> 23:32.037
K'tano's collected Jaffa from six System
Lords. He must be doing something right.

23:32.162 --> 23:36.250
Well, they have no problem with dying.
I have a problem with that.

23:36.375 --> 23:41.088
With dying? Or with the fact that
they don't have a problem with it?

23:42.214 --> 23:44.258
Both. I think.

23:47.636 --> 23:51.765
Get some sleep.
We have to bond in the morning.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.748
Kree!

24:16.874 --> 24:20.210
You are surrounded!
Relinquish your weapons!

24:48.655 --> 24:50.491
- Hey!
- He does not know fear.

24:50.616 --> 24:52.659
Well, he knows stupid!

25:02.169 --> 25:04.838
Hal mak! Hold your fire!

25:07.216 --> 25:12.721
I am K'tano. If you've heard that name,
then you know that there are other Jaffa

25:12.846 --> 25:15.432
who believe that the Goa'uld
are false gods!

25:16.099 --> 25:18.685
Join us in the struggle
against our oppressors

25:18.810 --> 25:20.938
and live to see freedom!

25:31.782 --> 25:35.911
If you do not believe in freedom
for our people, brother,

25:37.412 --> 25:39.456
then shoot me now.

26:13.282 --> 26:15.951
Do you believe in him now, O'Neill?

26:36.221 --> 26:38.265
Teal'c.

26:45.606 --> 26:48.275
I'm a little concerned about K'tano.

26:49.151 --> 26:52.321
- Explain.
- Oh, you know. That stunt he just pulled.

26:52.446 --> 26:55.115
K'tano is driven by
the power of his beliefs.

26:55.240 --> 26:59.995
His beliefs are very impressive, but
his tactics could've gotten us all killed.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.957
- K'tano was successful.
- I say he got lucky.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.543
Then it appears we disagree.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.881
K'tano summons us.

27:14.468 --> 27:17.721
- Sir?
- We got a problem with Teal'c.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.890
He's buyin' into K'tano's act.

27:20.015 --> 27:25.479
You don't really think it's an act, do you?
K'tano certainly believes in this cause.

27:25.604 --> 27:29.441
I think K'tano believes
he could walk on water.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.622
The fruits of our newborn alliance.

27:44.289 --> 27:47.501
The cutting edge that is
the sword of our rebellion.

27:47.626 --> 27:50.629
Weapons- grade naqahdah, sir. A lot of it.

27:50.754 --> 27:54.550
That's quite a haul.
What are you gonna do with it?

27:54.675 --> 27:58.011
I will give you as much as is fair.
I have plans for the rest.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.265
As for the zat'n'ktels, we require them all.

28:01.390 --> 28:05.477
I will be able to offer you many times
as much once the Ha'tak arrives.

28:05.602 --> 28:09.064
- You're expecting a mothership?
- You chose your allies well.

28:09.189 --> 28:14.278
Jaffa loyal to me are staging a mutiny, as
we speak, aboard a powerful mothership.

28:14.403 --> 28:16.989
Soon they will unite with us in our cause.

28:17.114 --> 28:21.451
A mutiny? That's a little risky, isn't it?

28:24.413 --> 28:27.291
- There are always risks in war.
- But if they fail...

28:27.416 --> 28:31.211
- They will succeed as their cause is just.
- I wish it worked that way.

28:31.336 --> 28:34.923
Then they will succeed
with the strength of their resolve.

28:36.091 --> 28:39.553
Come with me to the Chaapa- ai.
See for yourself. Come.

28:57.905 --> 29:02.075
Nirrti must not learn of our raid.
She would surely hunt us down.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.244
We must cover our tracks.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.131
Tara'c.

29:19.468 --> 29:22.471
I chose you to lead this squad
of brave warriors

29:22.596 --> 29:25.891
because I know you will not fail me.

29:29.228 --> 29:33.857
Know that if you are struck down in battle,
you will live for ever in Kheb,

29:34.107 --> 29:36.860
free from Goa'uld oppression for all time.

29:53.418 --> 29:58.382
Fight your way as deeply as you can into
Nirrti's force. Show them your resolve.

29:58.507 --> 30:00.551
- Kalach Shal Tek!
- Kalach Shal Tek!

30:01.718 --> 30:04.555
Victory or death.

30:08.559 --> 30:13.313
- Sir, that's a naqahdah- enhanced bomb.
- He's sending them on a suicide mission.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.732
Jaffa, kree!

30:16.191 --> 30:18.235
Guys, wait a minute!

30:23.949 --> 30:25.617
What the hell are you doing?

30:27.494 --> 30:31.707
- You now see the strength of our resolve.
- I see the strength of your arrogance!

30:31.832 --> 30:34.209
Do not interfere in
what you know nothing about.

30:34.334 --> 30:38.297
- I know exactly what you're about.
- We are at war! It is our way.

30:38.422 --> 30:43.635
I suppose you feel all- powerful to know
how eager those boys are to die for you.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.639
- Their souls are going to a better place.
- I've heard that before.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.766
You would deny the existence of Kheb?

30:50.601 --> 30:52.728
That their souls will find paradise?

30:52.853 --> 30:56.356
What Colonel O'Neill means is,
we do things differently.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.567
Again you say your ways are different.

30:58.692 --> 31:03.572
We should abandon centuries of Jaffa
tradition and follow the ways of the Tauri.

31:04.448 --> 31:06.241
Which of us is arrogant?

31:06.366 --> 31:09.536
If we're to have an alliance,
we have to find a common ground.

31:09.661 --> 31:14.541
Soon the Ha'tak will come, and this army
will be a true force to be reckoned with.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.503
If you wish to ally yourselves
with that force,

31:17.628 --> 31:20.714
then accept us for who and what we are.

31:22.591 --> 31:25.677
If not, then leave us now.

31:27.262 --> 31:29.306
Teal'c.

31:54.498 --> 31:56.959
Expect resistance here and here.

31:58.168 --> 32:02.381
Daniel Jackson witnessed the
System Lord Yu being stabbed by Osiris.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.092
With his sarcophagus, he survived.

32:05.217 --> 32:07.803
Still, he was severely
weakened by the attack.

32:07.928 --> 32:11.682
His home world can be taken
if his personal guard can be eliminated.

32:11.807 --> 32:14.142
Now is when Lord Yu
will be most vulnerable.

32:14.268 --> 32:17.354
- Then now is the time to strike.
- Indeed.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.274
I have several loyal Jaffa among his court.

32:20.399 --> 32:23.443
Many of his Jaffa would join us
if he were to be struck down.

32:23.569 --> 32:25.362
We could commandeer his fleet.

32:25.487 --> 32:28.991
Ships filled with Jaffa
ready to flock to our cause.

32:29.116 --> 32:31.994
I have dreamed of it
but I never thought it possible.

32:35.581 --> 32:37.624
Teal'c.

32:38.167 --> 32:41.753
We're packin' up.
I'd like you to come with us.

32:42.921 --> 32:45.215
His place is here.

32:50.262 --> 32:52.306
Teal'c?

32:57.686 --> 33:00.355
K'tano has given me
a mission of great importance.

33:00.439 --> 33:04.026
- I'll bet he has.
- I have accepted this mission freely.

33:05.986 --> 33:08.030
Don't do it.

33:09.531 --> 33:12.743
Lord Yu's Stargate will be unguarded.

33:12.868 --> 33:15.996
The plan is bold enough
to succeed, O'Neill.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.211
More so if you join us.

33:24.254 --> 33:26.215
Can't do it.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.732
Why him?

33:46.652 --> 33:49.613
Teal'c's participation
will guarantee our success.

33:49.738 --> 33:53.951
Teal'c is a leader in his own right.
You might not want him around.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.954
- He will be one of our greatest warriors.
- If he lives.

33:57.079 --> 33:59.122
- He will succeed.
- Because you say so?

33:59.248 --> 34:03.961
- Because he is Teal'c.
- All right, let me see if I got this straight.

34:04.086 --> 34:08.257
You assassinate one System Lord after
another, take their ships and warriors,

34:08.382 --> 34:11.592
all of whom are willing to die for you.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.013
And this is different
than the way things are now...

34:16.473 --> 34:18.141
how?

34:18.266 --> 34:21.353
- The Jaffa will be free.
- To follow you.

34:22.062 --> 34:23.772
I grow tired of this.

34:23.897 --> 34:25.940
It is time!

34:37.327 --> 34:39.371
Teal'c?

34:42.916 --> 34:47.795
I'm not going to recommend an alliance.
Not as long as he's in charge.

34:50.174 --> 34:53.635
- We will speak of this when I return.
- I don't think so.

34:54.511 --> 34:57.556
Because if you do this,
I don't think you're coming back.

34:57.681 --> 35:00.809
When I return victorious,
will you reconsider?

35:00.934 --> 35:03.604
- Tough call.
- Trust in me, O'Neill.

35:06.064 --> 35:08.108
All of you.

35:10.277 --> 35:13.071
Teal'c, you are strong and you are wise.

35:13.197 --> 35:16.408
Upon your return you shall be
my second- in- command.

36:04.581 --> 36:09.628
Teal'c, perhaps I am not
as weak as you were led to believe.

36:10.212 --> 36:14.967
My Jaffa has brought you before me
because I wanted it so.

36:17.219 --> 36:19.179
K'tano has sent you to kill me.

36:22.432 --> 36:26.770
Your faith is not blind.
I know this of you.

36:27.729 --> 36:30.399
I am going to offer you your life.

36:30.899 --> 36:34.570
I will even allow you
to return to your rebel army.

36:36.321 --> 36:39.825
But first, there is something
you must know.

36:49.293 --> 36:52.963
O'Neill, will you not reconsider?

36:53.088 --> 36:58.552
As Bra'tac said, we are stronger together.
Can we put aside our petty differences?

37:00.888 --> 37:05.851
I'm holding you personally responsible
for whatever happens to Teal'c.

37:07.019 --> 37:09.521
- Carter, dial us outta here.
- Yes, sir.

37:40.844 --> 37:42.888
Incoming, sir!

37:46.183 --> 37:48.352
- Teal'c!
- What happened?

37:52.564 --> 37:54.024
Thanks for the update.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.276
Deceiver!

37:56.401 --> 37:58.487
We have been deceived!

37:58.612 --> 38:00.656
Deceiver!

38:01.323 --> 38:06.578
I have deceived no one. The Ha'tak is just
now entering the system. All will be clear.

38:06.703 --> 38:10.207
Lord Yu knows Cal Mah
is the location of this rebel army.

38:10.332 --> 38:13.836
He knows our numbers.
He knows you have betrayed him.

38:13.961 --> 38:16.630
The mutiny on board
Lord Yu's ship has failed.

38:16.755 --> 38:20.759
The Ha'tak you await
brings doom, not salvation!

38:20.884 --> 38:24.346
The System Lords merely bided their time
to root out all rebel Jaffa,

38:24.471 --> 38:27.558
so that they may be crushed
in one all- out attack!

38:27.683 --> 38:30.561
The betrayer has been betrayed.

38:33.772 --> 38:35.107
Joma Secu.

38:38.777 --> 38:42.364
- You challenge me?
- Joma Secu!

38:44.575 --> 38:46.451
Very well.

39:01.592 --> 39:04.386
If you intervene,
the challenge will be forfeit.

39:15.606 --> 39:19.610
- Perhaps you think I will spare you.
- This is a fight to the death. Your death.

39:19.735 --> 39:20.986
Shol'va!

39:29.828 --> 39:32.331
Is that the best you can do? Hm?

39:56.813 --> 39:58.857
Beg for mercy.

40:02.486 --> 40:04.321
I die free.

40:11.370 --> 40:14.039
You die at the hand of your god...

40:14.832 --> 40:16.917
Imhotep.

41:03.213 --> 41:05.174
He is not Jaffa.

41:05.299 --> 41:07.342
K'tano is not Jaffa!

41:08.260 --> 41:11.972
He was a Goa'uld. The Goa'uld Imhotep.

41:12.097 --> 41:17.561
He used the Jaffa's desire for freedom
against them so he could gain power.

41:20.272 --> 41:25.777
K'tano was a lie.
What brought us to Cal Mah is not.

41:26.069 --> 41:28.947
Lord Yu's ship will attack at any moment.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.117
Follow us.

41:32.409 --> 41:34.828
Leave with us if you wish to live!

41:35.287 --> 41:39.041
Follow Teal'c. He speaks the truth.

41:39.333 --> 41:42.961
And he has won the right!
You all witnessed.

41:44.213 --> 41:50.594
K'tano has been beaten in the rite of Joma
Secu! Teal'c is our rightful leader now.

41:52.429 --> 41:54.723
- Carter?
- Way ahead of you, sir.

41:58.894 --> 42:00.103
Leave with us.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.525
Leave with us if you wish to live!

42:38.725 --> 42:40.769
Teal'c, let's go.

42:46.775 --> 42:49.486
Our time will come, old friend.

42:49.611 --> 42:51.655
But not this day.
