WEBVTT

00:14.056 --> 00:15.474
We're being lied to.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.562
- Everyone has to see this.
- Everyone who?

00:20.562 --> 00:21.480
Everyone.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.066
Is it-- Would it be possible to
get this up on every computer?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.025
No.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.694
- What?
- Well, no, I mean, it's not impossible.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.363
All computer screens are controlled by IT.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.531
Now you wanna break into IT.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.908
There are signal boosters every 30 levels.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.368
Okay, which is the lowest one?

00:34.368 --> 00:36.119
I need to get out
of the Up Top and the Mids.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.788
There's one on 126.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.373
- Great, we'll go there.
- No, wait.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.542
There are security teams on every level.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.752
And unless I'm mistaken,
they're all looking for you.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.379
- There's no way--
- I can get us there.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.505
Go and give me the watch.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.298
- No, you're coming with us. Yeah.
- Like hell I am.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.508
You asked me for a computer guy

00:49.508 --> 00:51.343
who could do tricks,
and I got you the computer guy.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.469
As good as he is,

00:52.469 --> 00:54.888
Bernard is better.
And he's gonna trace it back here.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.806
Do you wanna stay?

00:56.682 --> 00:58.433
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.352
Fuck me.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.730
Danny-- Great. Real great.
All right. Fuck.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.815
Got it.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.318
- Where's the drive?
- In an apartment on 22.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.321
- Whose apartment?
- It's assigned to Patrick Kennedy.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.699
We need all raiders to 22.
All raiders to 22.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.616
Who's he? A friend of hers?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.159
- I thought you checked all--
- He's not a friend.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.703
But she did save his life.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.873
We need all raiders to 22.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.543
Knock it down.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.727
- Fuck. We gotta go now.
- Not yet! The red light's on!

01:41.727 --> 01:43.145
- They're coming.
- Shit.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.650
Go!

01:52.112 --> 01:53.280
Okay.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.448
All right. Good.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.242
Come on! Pull the hatch.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.252
How are we gonna--

02:15.511 --> 02:16.595
Go.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.933
D, you gotta move. Come on.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.524
They searched the level. She's not there.

02:28.524 --> 02:32.486
She would've been seen on the stairs.
Where is she?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.738
Mr. Sims?

02:34.738 --> 02:37.282
A message came through
from one of your agents.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.548
Deputy. Yeah, this is all my fault.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.883
When I sent you home,

02:54.883 --> 02:59.221
I thought I was clear
I expected you to stay there.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.476
- Was I not clear about that?
- No. You were.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.981
Yet you went to Nichols's apartment.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.068
You think because you taught her
a class on the Pact,

03:13.068 --> 03:14.695
a raider wouldn't tell me?

03:16.613 --> 03:17.614
No.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.869
Why did you go to Nichols's apartment?

03:22.452 --> 03:25.581
I thought if I could find out
why she said she wanted to go out,

03:26.957 --> 03:28.375
I might be able to find her.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.837
Did you find anything
that gave you some insight?

03:32.713 --> 03:33.714
No.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.886
Did you find anything
that might explain why

03:38.886 --> 03:42.264
she had you arrest me the other day...

03:44.808 --> 03:46.602
or why you agreed to it?

03:50.147 --> 03:54.610
Did you find anything that might explain
why she went to my apartment,

03:54.610 --> 03:57.654
threatening to kill my wife and my son?

04:05.996 --> 04:11.043
Deputy, I can't help
but notice your hands.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.045
You're holding your right in your left.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.007
Why is that?

04:21.220 --> 04:23.013
Okay, Danny. Gotta go in here. Move.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.223
- Okay.
- Go.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.307
Go.

04:26.892 --> 04:27.893
You okay?

04:27.893 --> 04:29.394
It almost hit me!

04:29.394 --> 04:31.480
- Okay. Where is it?
- It's this way.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.564
Okay.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.527
Here.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.241
Okay.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.832
- Okay. Shit.
- Move, I'll do it.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.880
Give me the drive.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.132
Hey. Is that a camera?

04:59.716 --> 05:00.592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.761
- Probably.
- Give me your hammer.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.848
Don't. Anywhere a camera goes dark,
they're more likely to send raiders.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.057
They're gonna send them
as soon as you plug that in.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.017
Just give me a second. Here we go.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.564
The drive just popped on 126.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.899
- Where?
- At our hub.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.025
Go get Sims.

05:20.028 --> 05:20.863
There.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.080
They found us.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.373
Well, fine then.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.461
I radioed Karins.
She'll be there in five minutes.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.797
- Oh, shit.
- What?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.090
They're linking screens.

05:45.971 --> 05:46.972
Come on.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.021
Yeah.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.906
Shut your eyes, all of you!

06:03.906 --> 06:08.035
Shut your eyes!
Turn around. Cover your faces.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.871
- Do what he says!
- Move.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.247
- Yes, sir.
- You too, Robert.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.893
What? What happened? Did it shut down?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.857
- They shut everything down.
- What? Fuck!

06:38.857 --> 06:41.276
- It's over. You gotta go. Go now.
- Okay.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.278
- Go with him.
- No. No, w-- Hey!

06:43.278 --> 06:45.906
- What about the watch?
- You fucking kidding?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.116
Fuck.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.039
What you have just seen...

06:56.375 --> 06:57.960
you will unsee.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.643
<i>This is Karins on 126.
We have two men in custody.</i>

07:14.643 --> 07:15.602
What about Nichols?

07:15.602 --> 07:19.022
<i>We have the level on lockdown.
We'll find her.</i>

07:19.982 --> 07:24.820
- Yeah, we've heard that before.
- She's smart. And she's brave.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.322
And she's not on 126 anymore.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.908
- Where is she?
- She's in the trash chute.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.286
That's how she's getting around.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.717
- Oh, shit.
- I see her.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.427
- Has she gotten out?
- <i>No, sir.</i>

07:48.427 --> 07:50.012
Go to Recycling. Get anything heavy.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.188
Nichols, get out at the next hatch!

07:59.188 --> 08:01.148
I've been told to knock you
out of the chute.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.347
- You get her?
- I'm not sure.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.099
Make sure.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.463
Get her!
Oh, my God. Get out. Get her out--

10:45.521 --> 10:47.272
- You should've come to me.
- What would you have done?

10:47.272 --> 10:49.608
- I wouldn't have brought her here.
- Where else was I supposed to take her?

10:49.608 --> 10:50.567
I don't know, but--

10:53.070 --> 10:53.987
Judicial's here.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.198
What?
Wait, how did they know she was here?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.741
I told them.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.036
There is nowhere that we could hide her
they wouldn't find.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.788
They'd tear Mechanical apart.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.208
Everybody in the Down Deep
would pay the price.

11:06.834 --> 11:07.709
You asshole.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.212
No. He's right.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.676
I'm okay.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.514
Before you let 'em in,
I need a minute with Walk.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.015
I'll try.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.823
All things considered,

11:37.823 --> 11:40.367
it would've been better
if you'd stayed in the Mids with your dad

11:40.367 --> 11:41.785
when you were 13 years old.

11:41.785 --> 11:45.205
Walk, listen to me.
There are things I need to tell you, okay?

11:46.915 --> 11:47.958
One minute, please.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.377
- She's not going anywhere.
- Shirley.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.462
Don't-- Hey!

11:52.462 --> 11:54.006
Don't.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.512
Out. You, get out.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.473
- Wait. She can't-- She can't leave.
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.852
- She hasn't left in 25 years.
- I said shut the fuck up.

12:06.852 --> 12:07.936
Rob.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.814
You, over there now.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.775
If we were alone,

12:13.775 --> 12:16.153
this would be going
very differently right now.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.863
I wouldn't have hurt your family.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.866
My son keeps asking
if the scary lady is coming back.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.285
Well, how many families do you think
ask the same about you?

12:23.285 --> 12:26.163
- Do you know what I do? Do you?
- Rob. Rob!

12:27.164 --> 12:28.790
Wait outside with your team.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.383
If you'd been able
to do what you wanted to,

12:39.176 --> 12:42.387
- you would've killed everyone in the Silo.
- People can handle the truth.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.306
I wish I shared your optimism.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.650
I'll have to put you in shackles.

12:55.859 --> 12:56.985
So I don't run again?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.320
Really more for show.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.866
I have a proposal. A deal for you.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.995
In order to prevent rebellion
and severe Judicial repercussions

13:06.995 --> 13:08.580
for your friends down deep,

13:08.580 --> 13:12.459
I need you to stop saying
you didn't ask to go outside

13:12.459 --> 13:14.753
and waive your right
to a Judicial hearing.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.643
Just tell me what happened to George.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.272
If you cooperate,
I can do better than tell you.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.058
<i>I wish I'd talked her out of it.</i>

14:11.351 --> 14:12.186
Out of what?

14:12.186 --> 14:14.396
Going after that shitty heat tape
when ours ran out.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.648
That's what pissed them off up top.

14:16.648 --> 14:20.444
I'm sure they have a long list
of things she did that pissed them off.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.614
Well, I'd better get back
to the control room.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.908
Give Knox more of the silent treatment.

14:25.908 --> 14:26.867
Shirley.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.493
He turned Jules in.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.872
You would've at least
made those assholes find her on their own.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.916
Yeah, 'cause I'm such a hero.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.126
Too scared to walk out that door.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.883
Knox had no choice.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.678
He had a choice. We all had a choice.

16:27.613 --> 16:28.614
Come on.

16:29.448 --> 16:35.120
Come on, you old fool.
You're all she's got.

16:45.547 --> 16:50.385
You're not gonna die. Just feels like it.

17:17.246 --> 17:20.582
Walker, what are you doing?

17:22.667 --> 17:23.669
Getting some air.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.771
Okay. Just wait.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.190
Wait, just--

17:45.899 --> 17:48.110
I need water. Can I have water?

18:07.713 --> 18:08.714
Okay.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.812
Dogs! Settle!

18:29.401 --> 18:30.402
Carla.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.030
Martha.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.408
You look well.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.994
I don't remember you being a liar.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.583
I never expected to see you up here again.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.918
That makes two of us.

18:48.378 --> 18:52.591
So, how are things in Supply?

18:54.426 --> 18:58.889
What? Wait, this have to do with Nichols?

19:00.474 --> 19:02.935
Is this about that fucking heat tape?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.853
It is.

19:04.853 --> 19:08.023
You know that stunt of hers
brought Judicial down,

19:08.023 --> 19:09.816
and that head of IT asshole.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.069
The one who became mayor.

19:12.069 --> 19:16.281
Why do they care so much?
Your tape is way better than theirs.

19:16.281 --> 19:22.204
Yeah, I know. Doesn't make any sense.
Unless it does.

19:29.545 --> 19:32.589
Stop. Unlock her.

19:33.757 --> 19:34.967
And leave us.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.357
If she tells anyone what she sees,
we'll have to bring them in.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.695
She won't. We made a deal.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.178
What is this? What are we doing here?

20:21.430 --> 20:22.431
Mr. Sims.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.837
I realize this is a breach
of our protocols,

20:53.837 --> 20:57.758
but I'm making an exception
for the sheriff before she cleans.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.265
Pull the surveillance of George Wilkins
on the stairs.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.314
We never had a chance.

21:13.232 --> 21:14.066
No.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.362
- How much do you wanna see?
- Go to where they stop.

21:20.906 --> 21:21.740
Volume.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.742
- <i>Keep walking.</i>
- <i>I need water.</i>

21:23.742 --> 21:26.745
We believe he deliberately stopped
in front of a camera.

21:27.663 --> 21:29.748
By then, he knew what they looked like.

21:34.545 --> 21:35.379
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

21:35.379 --> 21:37.714
- <i>Take one more step...</i>
- Go in closer.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.634
<i>...and I will be very stupid.</i>

21:40.634 --> 21:43.387
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- <i>You were ordered to take me alive?</i>

21:43.387 --> 21:46.056
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>So someone could torture me</i>

21:46.056 --> 21:48.809
<i>until I gave up the hard drive
and the people I worked with.</i>

21:48.809 --> 21:52.271
- <i>No. They just want to talk to you.</i>
- <i>You're not a good liar.</i>

21:52.271 --> 21:53.188
<i>Oh, well.</i>

21:57.568 --> 21:58.569
<i>No!</i>

22:53.540 --> 22:54.875
How we doing today?

22:55.876 --> 22:57.377
Everything's pretty calm.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.631
Hasn't been this quiet
since Holston walked.

23:04.635 --> 23:05.636
Rob,

23:06.929 --> 23:10.724
I was rash when I said
I was worried about you being my shadow.

23:12.392 --> 23:17.314
Tomorrow, when Nichols is out on the hill,
we'll have another discussion, okay?

23:34.957 --> 23:38.168
Thought you might not be eating,
so I baked you something.

23:38.168 --> 23:40.671
I'm okay. I don't have much appetite,
so I'm--

23:41.797 --> 23:43.924
You remember what we always said
when you were little?

23:43.924 --> 23:46.426
- Yeah, "At least one bite."
- "At least one bite."

23:53.851 --> 23:54.977
Mom used to make this.

23:57.521 --> 23:59.189
Dad, I--

24:00.774 --> 24:02.651
I'm sorry I blamed you for everything.

24:02.651 --> 24:07.030
No. No, we should've talked about it
a long time ago.

24:10.033 --> 24:16.665
Jules, honey, why'd you say
you wanted to go out?

24:16.665 --> 24:20.002
- Was it something I could've done?
- No, I didn't-- I...

24:32.681 --> 24:35.184
I didn't know you were such a good cook.
It's really good.

24:38.145 --> 24:39.938
Not bad for an old guy, huh?

24:52.409 --> 24:53.243
Bring him in.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.127
You can go.

25:10.511 --> 25:16.517
Lukas, owing, in part,
to your cooperation,

25:17.601 --> 25:20.646
we have Juliette Nichols in custody.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.106
What's gonna happen to her?

25:23.815 --> 25:26.235
I'd be more concerned about
what happens to you.

25:27.945 --> 25:28.946
I helped you.

25:29.738 --> 25:34.368
Yes. And in recognition of that,
you will not be sent out to clean.

25:37.204 --> 25:40.207
No, you will go to the mines.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.918
Ten years.

25:43.544 --> 25:44.586
Which is a shame,

25:45.587 --> 25:47.840
because you have so much natural talent.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.884
So much intellectual curiosity.

25:51.844 --> 25:56.265
To sit in the cafeteria
night after night alone,

25:56.265 --> 25:58.433
watching the lights in the sky.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.689
You'll see no lights in the mines.

26:05.566 --> 26:10.487
But maybe ten years of hauling iron ore
will set you straight.

26:43.812 --> 26:44.855
They smell great.

26:45.856 --> 26:50.777
Just, everyone's bringing me food, Shirl,
so-- I'm just not hungry.

26:51.862 --> 26:55.532
Walk says if you eat 'em all,
maybe you won't fit into the suit.

26:56.575 --> 26:57.951
You gotta taste at least one.

26:59.411 --> 27:02.039
- No, I don't--
- She said you should take the whole box...

27:03.874 --> 27:04.875
for luck.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.756
Yeah.

27:16.011 --> 27:16.845
Okay?

27:19.681 --> 27:24.478
Hey. I'm okay. Yeah.

27:54.633 --> 27:58.011
"You wanted the truth.
The truth is I love you.

28:00.264 --> 28:03.183
Have no fear, they're good in Supply."

28:09.147 --> 28:12.401
Hey. I just got her down.

28:14.528 --> 28:18.031
Kat, there's something I have to tell you.

28:18.031 --> 28:18.949
What?

28:19.616 --> 28:22.411
Sims knows I have the Syndrome.

28:25.873 --> 28:27.249
So what does that mean?

28:27.249 --> 28:30.294
Are you fired? Do we have to move? We--

28:30.294 --> 28:33.839
We don't have to move. And I'm not fired.

28:40.262 --> 28:43.432
The mayor and Judicial are gonna grant me
an exemption.

29:07.122 --> 29:08.123
Thank you, Sheriff.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.001
Do you mind giving us a few minutes?

29:11.627 --> 29:13.212
Mister Mayor, if you don't mind,

29:13.212 --> 29:15.714
- until it's official, I really--
- I know.

29:19.801 --> 29:24.681
He's such a stickler for the rules.
I can't officially swear him in until--

29:24.681 --> 29:25.599
Till I'm dead?

29:29.561 --> 29:30.812
He'll make a great sheriff.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.398
Probably should've been him
from the beginning.

29:35.484 --> 29:37.069
Do you regret taking the job?

29:38.195 --> 29:39.029
Not at all.

29:39.029 --> 29:42.407
You could still be in Mechanical,
tinkering with the generator.

29:43.450 --> 29:44.576
I want you to know

29:46.370 --> 29:49.540
that I take no pleasure from this.
Any of it.

29:50.290 --> 29:51.208
So quit.

29:51.792 --> 29:57.005
Well, I think about it
at least once a day.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.800
But I don't want to burden you
with my troubles.

30:00.968 --> 30:05.138
You once asked me
when your troubles started.

30:06.682 --> 30:08.350
When I stole the fucking tape.

30:08.350 --> 30:11.478
No, your troubles started at conception.

30:11.478 --> 30:14.189
Your parents weren't supposed to
have children.

30:14.773 --> 30:15.983
But accidents happen.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.611
So sending me outside,
that's your way of putting things right?

30:20.320 --> 30:21.446
Hardly.

30:22.114 --> 30:23.740
Every human life has value.

30:24.575 --> 30:27.286
You've been of great service to the Silo.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.246
But once you became sheriff

30:29.246 --> 30:31.290
and you started to look into
Wilkins's death--

30:31.290 --> 30:32.958
I outlived my usefulness.

30:32.958 --> 30:36.670
You became a mortal threat
to our survival.

30:37.713 --> 30:38.881
To our survival?

30:40.924 --> 30:44.386
You know, if this place needs
the death of George

30:44.386 --> 30:47.472
and Jahns, and Marnes,
the sheriff and his wife,

30:47.472 --> 30:49.224
there's something very wrong
with this Silo.

30:49.224 --> 30:50.893
And you know what?

30:50.893 --> 30:53.187
I don't want to be
of great service anymore.

30:56.815 --> 30:57.774
You were an engineer.

30:59.818 --> 31:01.820
You watched the gauges day and night.

31:01.820 --> 31:04.573
And if the pressure got
too high or too low,

31:04.573 --> 31:06.158
you made adjustments,

31:06.158 --> 31:08.952
because if you didn't, boom.

31:10.746 --> 31:12.372
Well, I am an engineer, too.

31:13.457 --> 31:17.336
But instead of a generator,
I keep the Silo running safely.

31:17.336 --> 31:20.923
When Allison Becker and George Wilkins
opened that hard drive,

31:20.923 --> 31:23.717
unless adjustments were made,

31:23.717 --> 31:27.804
it was just a matter of time
before everything went boom.

31:27.804 --> 31:30.641
Was my mom one of your little adjustments?

31:31.266 --> 31:33.894
That was her choice.

31:36.522 --> 31:39.942
But you know the display is a lie.

31:41.109 --> 31:44.947
So, why don't you just tell people
that it's okay to go outside?

31:45.489 --> 31:46.907
And how about the door?

31:46.907 --> 31:48.617
The massive door made of steel,

31:48.617 --> 31:50.285
at the bottom of the Silo,
that George found.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.162
Why don't you tell people about that?

31:56.583 --> 32:00.712
The Founders left us with many mysteries.

32:04.675 --> 32:07.094
It's time we both dressed
for the occasion.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.388
Congratulations, by the way.

32:09.388 --> 32:12.558
You've attracted the largest crowd
we've ever had for a clean.

32:14.184 --> 32:15.644
Even larger than Holston's.

32:19.857 --> 32:20.858
I won't clean.

32:22.484 --> 32:24.945
Nobody intends to, but they always do.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.907
As the Founders, in their wisdom,
knew they would.

32:31.827 --> 32:32.828
Which reminds me...

32:34.955 --> 32:37.165
your last request was granted.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.222
Deputy!

34:46.879 --> 34:50.047
"Juliette Nichols,
you have been charged with

34:50.047 --> 34:54.761
and convicted of violating
the cardinal law of our society.

34:56.263 --> 34:59.600
Any spoken request
to leave the Silo is granted.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.851
But it is irrevocable.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.812
You've been asked to clean

35:03.812 --> 35:06.190
and have been provided
with the materials to do so.

35:07.482 --> 35:09.651
But you cannot be forced into cleaning.

35:10.319 --> 35:15.157
Once outside the air lock,
you are outside the law.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.787
We do not know why we are here.

35:22.748 --> 35:24.791
We do not know who built the Silo.

35:26.293 --> 35:30.380
We do not know why
everything outside the Silo is as it is.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.927
We do not know
when it will be safe to go outside.

35:36.094 --> 35:40.807
We only know that
that day is not this day.

35:42.434 --> 35:43.769
Juliette Nichols,

35:43.769 --> 35:46.605
on behalf of all the people of the Silo,

35:47.439 --> 35:48.857
I hope you will clean

35:48.857 --> 35:53.195
so that we will see
the world outside our sanctuary as it is

35:53.987 --> 35:58.242
and thereby be reminded that here is safe,

35:59.743 --> 36:02.079
and there is not."

36:04.331 --> 36:08.293
Juliette Nichols, have you any last words?

36:10.838 --> 36:11.839
I'm not afraid.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.634
The display is a lie.

39:07.806 --> 39:08.807
What do we do?

39:10.392 --> 39:11.935
It won't be much longer.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.898
She'll be done
before she reaches the tree.

39:33.415 --> 39:34.416
Right on schedule.

40:09.284 --> 40:10.285
She knows.

40:11.662 --> 40:12.663
Knows what?

40:56.707 --> 40:58.125
They're good in Supply.
