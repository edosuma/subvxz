WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:01.026
Marry me, Desna.

00:01.028 --> 00:02.460
Please tell me again.

00:02.462 --> 00:04.162
I went down on my knees.

00:04.164 --> 00:06.197
And she said yes.

00:06.199 --> 00:09.000
- You know what your problem is?
- Yeah... you.

00:09.002 --> 00:10.268
You're delusional.

00:10.270 --> 00:13.754
- I hate you, Lillian!
- You mean your sister Lillian?

00:13.756 --> 00:15.105
II need help. I need help.

00:15.107 --> 00:17.080
No. I need you to
take me to the hospital.

00:17.105 --> 00:18.604
I didn't sign nothing.

00:18.606 --> 00:20.106
Well, you didn't know
you was signing somethin',

00:20.108 --> 00:21.307
but you signed somethin'.

00:21.309 --> 00:23.042
Now that your name's on the license,

00:23.044 --> 00:25.644
that means you're the only one
that can open up more clinics.

00:25.646 --> 00:27.780
But if Ruval marries you,

00:27.782 --> 00:29.515
he gets the license... when you die.

00:29.517 --> 00:31.317
You're under arrest for
money laundering and fraud.

00:31.319 --> 00:33.686
- I'm what?
- Bail is set at $500,000.

00:33.688 --> 00:34.820
I don't have that kind of money.

00:34.822 --> 00:35.921
It's taken care of.

00:35.923 --> 00:37.490
I would never betray you, Zlata.

00:37.492 --> 00:40.026
Your fiancé is not who you think he is.

00:40.028 --> 00:41.560
We must align to take him down.

00:41.562 --> 00:43.963
Are you gonna really marry Dr.
Ruval tomorrow?

00:43.965 --> 00:46.699
It's the only way to end this.

00:46.701 --> 00:49.368
All right, child.

00:49.370 --> 00:51.203
Let's get this shit over with.

00:52.874 --> 00:54.407
Be careful out there, folks.

00:54.409 --> 00:56.976
The conditions are worsening
along the Florida coast

00:56.978 --> 00:58.944
as we all brace for Hurricane Ignacia.

01:02.817 --> 01:05.684
I don't know where I
am, but I can see everything...

01:05.686 --> 01:07.920
remember everything...

01:07.922 --> 01:09.962
everything that led up

01:09.987 --> 01:11.087
to what happened.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.527
I used to love storms when I was little.

01:14.528 --> 01:16.161
I used to think they were magic

01:16.163 --> 01:18.096
and that everything
would be different after.

01:18.098 --> 01:22.167
Everything sure feels new now
after Desna's big day.

01:22.169 --> 01:26.404
Her fairytale...
except that was all a lie.

01:26.904 --> 01:29.741
You see, this is a different
kind of fairytale,

01:29.743 --> 01:32.642
and I'm still not sure
how I feel about the ending.

01:32.644 --> 01:34.036
But we're not there yet.

01:34.038 --> 01:37.415
So, we might as well start
at the "Once upon a time".

01:44.166 --> 01:46.867
Looks like Hurricane
Ignacia has been downgraded

01:46.869 --> 01:49.843
to a tropical storm
and is heading out to sea.

01:51.106 --> 01:53.073
So, all I gotta do is marry him.

01:53.075 --> 01:55.142
Zlata's gonna do the rest.

01:55.144 --> 01:57.077
Look at y'all two getting along.

01:57.079 --> 01:58.345
Something you want to share?

01:58.347 --> 02:00.581
You know what? Mind your nosey business.

02:00.583 --> 02:03.016
Damn! Is that how you
treat your bridesmaid?

02:03.018 --> 02:05.319
Fake bridesmaid. Don't ask.

02:05.321 --> 02:07.120
Where you going, Jenn?

02:07.122 --> 02:08.922
Girl, I'm moving to Tampa.

02:08.924 --> 02:11.391
Nuh! This place ain't gonna
be the same without you, girl.

02:11.393 --> 02:13.293
Exactly! What she said.

02:13.295 --> 02:15.162
Don't get me started crying.
You know I will.

02:15.164 --> 02:17.164
Well, give me some love, girl.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.533
Listen, you go put the X back in Tampa

02:19.535 --> 02:22.703
'cause if anybody can do it,
it's you with all that ass.

02:22.705 --> 02:24.671
All of this?

02:24.673 --> 02:25.839
Yes, ma'am!

02:27.343 --> 02:28.609
Look.

02:28.611 --> 02:33.580
Y'all, thank you
for backing me up on this.

02:33.582 --> 02:34.982
We are almost there.

02:34.984 --> 02:37.417
Stop. All right?

02:37.419 --> 02:39.052
Y'all close up whenever you want.

02:39.054 --> 02:42.479
I got to go meet Ruval's attorney.

02:42.992 --> 02:44.262
Girl, you sign those papers

02:44.287 --> 02:46.126
like the accessory to
murder that you are.

02:46.128 --> 02:49.463
Get it, girl!

02:49.465 --> 02:52.802
I'll miss you least of all,
Scarecrow.!

Everyone could feel the tension
in Palmetto,

03:01.176 --> 03:03.010
even the Husser boys.

03:03.012 --> 03:04.478
How's your uncle?

03:04.480 --> 03:07.114
He's ain't been the same
since Juanda got killed.

03:07.116 --> 03:08.672
Yeah, I know that life.

03:10.219 --> 03:12.634
Seeing my dad in the ground like that...

03:14.490 --> 03:16.456
kinda messed me up.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.473
I never said goodbye to mine, either.

03:19.194 --> 03:20.517
Two dead daddies.

03:25.801 --> 03:28.602
You know, your dad was quite
the legend in Biloxi.

03:28.604 --> 03:30.537
Shit, hardly remember the dude.

03:30.539 --> 03:33.040
Good businessman.

03:33.042 --> 03:34.323
Better gangster.

03:35.311 --> 03:37.326
Better than your uncle, that's for sure.

03:38.247 --> 03:40.037
Uncle Daddy's all right, man.

03:45.154 --> 03:46.553
Yeah.

03:46.555 --> 03:48.855
Must've felt real bad
after your daddy died.

03:48.857 --> 03:50.380
Yeah, no shit he did.

03:50.993 --> 03:54.695
My mama saw 'em before the
service, fighting like snakes.

03:54.697 --> 03:57.220
Then Clay found 'em bleeding out
on the lawn.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.140
Last words they ever said was hateful.

04:00.736 --> 04:03.352
Can you imagine the guilt he must carry?

04:04.707 --> 04:06.873
Clint tried to pull one over on Roller,

04:06.875 --> 04:09.776
but Desna was the one that
had to put on the real show.

04:09.778 --> 04:14.681
Whoa. You are quite the investor.

04:14.683 --> 04:16.283
I wanted it to be a surprise.

04:16.285 --> 04:18.051
My ass is surprised.

04:18.053 --> 04:20.721
- If you two need a moment...
- No, no, no. We're good.

04:20.723 --> 04:24.257
See, I think my fiancé
didn't tell me about all this

04:24.259 --> 04:25.659
'cause he thought I was a gold digger.

04:25.661 --> 04:27.661
Is that it?

04:27.663 --> 04:29.262
- Come on.
- That's what it is, isn't it?

04:29.264 --> 04:32.165
No, no, not at all.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.401
Whatever is mine is yours, my love.

04:34.403 --> 04:36.203
For the rest of our lives.

04:36.205 --> 04:37.571
For the rest of our lives.

04:37.573 --> 04:39.439
See how good she is?

04:39.441 --> 04:42.075
She finna win a lying Grammy over here.

04:42.077 --> 04:43.710
Wade, where do I sign?

04:45.000 --> 04:51.074

04:53.122 --> 04:55.021
How it go with lawyer?

04:55.023 --> 04:57.224
All the papers are signed.

04:57.226 --> 04:59.059
Are you ready for game day?

04:59.061 --> 05:03.029
About that... Can I talk to you
in private for a second?

05:03.031 --> 05:05.031
No worry. She hear nothing.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.832
She, Candy Crushing.

05:07.736 --> 05:08.869
Listen...

05:08.871 --> 05:11.571
How do you know he's not gon'
try to kill me

05:11.573 --> 05:13.306
as soon as we're married?

05:13.308 --> 05:15.776
Not going to kill you until honeymoon.

05:15.778 --> 05:19.446
Which is why you have to take
him out right after wedding.

05:19.448 --> 05:22.048
Me? Hell no! That wasn't the plan.

05:22.050 --> 05:23.517
You supposed to do it.

05:23.519 --> 05:25.152
You're only one close enough.

05:25.154 --> 05:26.253
No!

05:26.255 --> 05:27.521
- Yeah.
- Hell no.

05:27.523 --> 05:31.106
Yes, yes. Look at this baby.

05:31.693 --> 05:34.528
Been around since seventies,
but very effective.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.763
One drop in his drink. Is untraceable.

05:36.765 --> 05:38.865
I don't give a shit what it is, Zlata.

05:38.867 --> 05:41.101
I'm not doing it. That was not our deal.

05:41.103 --> 05:42.569
Your deal now.

05:42.571 --> 05:44.938
This is crossing the line.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.040
I ain't gon' murder nobody.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.341
That's your job.

05:48.343 --> 05:50.844
You don't get to choose, girlfriend.

05:50.846 --> 05:54.314
Until this is done, I am still boss.

05:54.316 --> 05:56.757
Unless you want to go back to jail.

05:57.359 --> 05:58.858
Take it!

06:08.937 --> 06:11.137
Thank you.

06:11.139 --> 06:13.339
- Yes.
- Ooh!

06:14.831 --> 06:17.801
Wait this place is fancy, y'all. Damn.

06:17.803 --> 06:20.235
Will y'all look at how these
glasses work with this jacket?

06:20.237 --> 06:23.838
I mean, everything seemed perfect,

06:23.840 --> 06:26.287
except our blushing bride's attitude.

06:26.312 --> 06:27.745
Where's your bridal glow?

06:27.747 --> 06:30.614
It's dim, okay?
Let's just get this over with.

06:30.616 --> 06:32.616
Okay, but is it bad if we
actually enjoy ourselves

06:32.618 --> 06:34.618
while we are pretending
to enjoy ourselves?

06:34.620 --> 06:36.353
- Yes.
- But I have to enjoy myself...

06:36.355 --> 06:37.888
Ms. Simms, soontobe Ruval.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.124
Welcome to Bon Ange.
Are you ready for your big day?

06:40.126 --> 06:43.861
Hell no. I'm ready for you to tell me
who the hell all these people are.

06:43.863 --> 06:46.897
'Cause we were supposed to have
the hotel to ourselves.

06:46.899 --> 06:49.066
What?

06:49.068 --> 06:50.668
It's a pharmaceutical convention.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.970
- They're on their own schedule.
- Let me tell you what.

06:52.972 --> 06:57.041
None of these people better not
be dipping in my party, okay?!

06:57.043 --> 07:00.210
We reserved the entire floor
with all the suites on it.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.845
I ain't playing around up in here.

07:01.847 --> 07:03.190
- Des, girl.
- What?

07:03.192 --> 07:04.615
Chill. I am chill, Virginia.

07:04.617 --> 07:06.750
You'll hardly notice they're here.

07:06.752 --> 07:08.686
- I better not.
- It'll be fine, Des.

07:08.688 --> 07:10.020
It's gonna be fine.

07:10.022 --> 07:11.221
And we gon' get you some edibles

07:11.223 --> 07:12.790
to go along with the champagne.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.325
- Okay?
- Better hurry.

07:14.327 --> 07:16.327
Shit. I ain't playing
with your little ass.

07:16.329 --> 07:17.728
- Move.
- Whoa.

07:17.730 --> 07:21.231
My God.
What is wrong with Bridezilla?

07:25.905 --> 07:27.538
Desna just texted me.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.406
Said it's popping off after the wedding.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.809
- Poppin' which way?
- Zlata doin' Ruval.

07:31.811 --> 07:33.877
Well, then we're gonna
do her at the wedding,

07:33.879 --> 07:36.680
and everything goes back to normal.
You know what I'm saying?

07:36.682 --> 07:39.516
Two foreign birds,
one allAmerican stone.

07:39.518 --> 07:41.852
How good is that gon' feel, baby?

07:41.854 --> 07:43.387
Me and Clint over there were reminiscing

07:43.389 --> 07:45.240
about our dead daddies.

07:46.359 --> 07:49.927
Yeah, anniversary of his death
is comin' right up on us.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.628
Yeah, you right.

07:51.630 --> 07:55.899
Hey, tell me that story again
about how him and Mom got shot.

07:55.901 --> 07:58.802
Shit, I told you that story
a thousand times, boy.

07:58.804 --> 08:00.838
Yeah, tell me again.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.576
Well, it was a pretty day.

08:05.578 --> 08:08.512
Real pretty Sunday, you know?

08:08.514 --> 08:11.615
One of them days that kind of tricks you

08:11.617 --> 08:13.384
'cause gives you no indication
of how bad things

08:13.386 --> 08:14.651
gonna become, you know?

08:14.653 --> 08:16.854
- Lot of those days?
- Yeah, there are.

08:16.856 --> 08:20.224
Sermon that day was about loss.
Believe it or not.

08:20.226 --> 08:21.625
I don't know how them priests do it.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.494
It's spooky, but they do it. They know.

08:23.496 --> 08:25.062
Somehow, they know, you know?

08:25.064 --> 08:27.431
Yeah. Shit.

08:27.433 --> 08:29.333
Must've been a hell of a sermon?

08:29.335 --> 08:31.802
Yeah, it was beautiful.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.674
And then I walk out, and I see your momma

08:38.677 --> 08:42.005
and daddy like that, lying on the lawn...

08:44.183 --> 08:45.675
full of holes.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.972
I'll never forget it.

08:56.562 --> 08:59.272
Shit, boy. Why'd you want
to talk about this.

09:02.234 --> 09:03.700
Just miss him.

09:03.702 --> 09:06.529
Each year it gets harder and
harder to remember his face.

09:07.306 --> 09:09.157
Yeah, that's grief.

09:10.209 --> 09:12.953
Grief clouds your memory
like that, you know?

09:14.146 --> 09:15.956
But he's alive, your daddy.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.543
He's living right here
in my heart and your heart.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.887
Juanda and I, we took you boys
that very night.

09:23.889 --> 09:24.988
Took y'all home.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.024
'Cause I wanted you to know
beyond a doubt

09:27.026 --> 09:31.094
that you had someone to love you
and take care of you.

09:37.803 --> 09:40.605
Now Bryce is goin' to Tampa and shit.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.941
Hell, boy, you better not go
anywhere, you know what I'm saying?

09:43.943 --> 09:46.611
Speakin' of Bryce, I gotta help him move.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.656
Later, Clay.

09:58.991 --> 10:02.526
So, that night, things
didn't just turn sideways.

10:02.528 --> 10:04.838
They turned upside down.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.602
You know what?

10:11.604 --> 10:14.438
Y'all, when's the last time
we got this dumb?

10:14.440 --> 10:17.174
When we were driving back
from Jacksonville

10:17.176 --> 10:19.276
and Jenn flashed the school bus.

10:19.278 --> 10:20.300
I knew you were gonna say that.

10:20.324 --> 10:21.879
I thought it was a
professional football team.

10:21.881 --> 10:24.948
It was a school bus. You had your
tatas up in the windshield.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.416
Ooh, girl,

10:26.441 --> 10:27.551
you better slow down.

10:27.553 --> 10:29.753
You don't want to be bloated
in your wedding dress.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.355
Then 'gram don't know it's fake.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.856
I don't give a shit about the 'gram.

10:32.858 --> 10:34.691
Well, how will Polly know what happened?

10:34.693 --> 10:37.094
I'm glad she's missing this mess.

10:37.096 --> 10:40.063
You know what? I'm about to give you
a preview of the speeches to come.

10:40.065 --> 10:41.565
It's about to make you feel
better. Watch this. Watch this.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.901
- Speeches!
- Yeah.

10:43.903 --> 10:46.270
Listen, Desna Simms.

10:46.272 --> 10:47.964
You have the biggest...

10:48.574 --> 10:51.375
tits that I've ever seen.

10:51.377 --> 10:56.556
But... But underneath that ample bosom...

10:59.585 --> 11:00.918
- Here she goes.
- Aww.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.887
Beats the most compassionate,
generous...

11:03.889 --> 11:05.956
- Okay. You know what?
- Seriously, stop.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.025
- Okay. That was beautiful.
- Aww.

11:08.027 --> 11:09.445
- That says it all.
- It will be better tomorrow.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.394
That says it all.

11:10.396 --> 11:11.495
I'll be able to do it tomorrow.

11:11.497 --> 11:12.930
- You gon' get it.
- And I will.

11:12.932 --> 11:14.464
- It'll be fine.
- A little more practice. Okay.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.999
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay, okay.

11:16.001 --> 11:17.634
- I'm next.
- Lord. Go ahead.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.704
You always give me shit
because I'm half Asian...

11:20.706 --> 11:24.174
really Vietnamese, because I
used to be a stripper...

11:24.176 --> 11:26.410
- Hey! Listen.
- Lord.

11:26.412 --> 11:28.545
And it used to get to me,

11:28.547 --> 11:31.915
but then I realized it's
because you care about me

11:31.917 --> 11:33.984
and you just want me to be better.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.218
- Yeah!
- Aww.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.287
And I love you.

11:37.289 --> 11:38.512
Okay, okay. You trying to make me cry.

11:38.536 --> 11:39.469
I don't like it.

11:39.471 --> 11:41.071
One more, one more. One more!
Here we go. Here we go.

11:41.073 --> 11:42.326
I can't believe you did that. Sit.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.561
Okay, okay, okay. All right,
all right, here we go.

11:44.563 --> 11:46.597
Shit.

11:46.599 --> 11:48.298
- You got it, Ann.
- Come on! Come on.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.100
Okay. All right.

11:50.102 --> 11:52.235
There are bad bitches
in this world, right?

11:52.237 --> 11:53.437
Amen.

11:53.439 --> 11:55.872
But once in a generation comes along

11:55.874 --> 11:58.475
a true O.G. gangster boss bitch.

11:58.477 --> 11:59.810
- Yes!
- I know, that's right.

11:59.812 --> 12:02.646
And that's you, Desna.

12:02.648 --> 12:04.281
Yes!

12:04.283 --> 12:05.549
Don't ever change.

12:05.551 --> 12:07.718
- Whoo!
- Shit, huzzah!

12:07.720 --> 12:09.853
- Yes, Ann.
- I can't. I can't.

12:09.855 --> 12:13.457
- Yes, Ann!
- Wait.

12:13.459 --> 12:15.659
I'll go talk to her. Let me.

12:19.598 --> 12:22.766
There you go. You really out?

12:22.768 --> 12:25.535
Yeah, that's the plan.
Right after the wedding.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.138
Even after stabby McRabbi?

12:28.140 --> 12:30.440
God damn it.

12:30.442 --> 12:33.910
That was my final performance
as a lowlife.

12:33.912 --> 12:36.613
I'm getting my abundance
coaching program going again.

12:36.615 --> 12:38.115
Get it, get it, baby. Get it, get it.

12:38.117 --> 12:41.585
That's right. I'ma be so
squeaky clean up in Tampa.

12:43.355 --> 12:45.856
Shit. Look at that.

12:45.858 --> 12:47.457
You remember when Pop died?

12:47.459 --> 12:49.726
Of course I do. How could I forget?

12:49.728 --> 12:51.796
You know Pop and Clay had a beef?

12:52.431 --> 12:54.549
Where is this coming from?

12:56.268 --> 12:58.368
Nah, It's nothing. Forget it.

12:58.370 --> 12:59.762
You're right.

13:01.306 --> 13:05.208
Hey. Talk to me.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.309
It's nothing, man.

13:06.311 --> 13:09.079
Come on. Big brother here.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.548
Something Clint said.
It's got under my skin.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.083
Hey, we don't know that dude.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.919
Bryce, he said his mom saw Uncle Daddy

13:15.921 --> 13:17.688
at the church when Pop got shot.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.923
And today Uncle Daddy
was goin' on all day

13:19.925 --> 13:20.818
about the sermon

13:20.843 --> 13:22.659
- that was said on that day.
- So?

13:22.661 --> 13:25.062
Uncle Daddy was supposed
to be in Gulfport.

13:25.064 --> 13:27.164
How does he know what sermon
was being said

13:27.166 --> 13:29.166
by the pastor that day?

13:29.168 --> 13:31.711
How do we even know who this man is?

13:32.638 --> 13:34.905
You know what?

13:34.907 --> 13:37.541
Uncle Daddy's been good to the both us.

13:37.543 --> 13:41.511
This whole conversation
is a nest of shit hornets

13:41.513 --> 13:43.854
I have no desire to step into.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.918
Okay, squeaky clean.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.937
I feel you.

13:52.024 --> 13:54.558
I did not sign up for this bullshit.

13:55.026 --> 13:56.159
I know. I know.

13:56.161 --> 13:58.762
And now I'm the one who gotta to kill

13:58.764 --> 14:00.831
this psychotic momma's boy.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.432
What?

14:02.434 --> 14:04.668
- When did that happen?
- Today.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.170
Zlata was supposed to do it, not me.

14:07.172 --> 14:10.474
Okay, it's gonna be all right. All right?

14:10.476 --> 14:12.242
- Did you make the call?
- Yeah.

14:12.244 --> 14:15.746
I called five times,
and I left messages, but...

14:15.748 --> 14:16.980
Okay. Okay, look.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.583
We just keep trying, all right?

14:19.585 --> 14:21.918
- Yeah.
- We got this.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.520
We... We got this.

14:23.522 --> 14:24.821
We got this.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.432
We just got to...

14:26.959 --> 14:28.759
- got to make it one more day.
- That's right.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.964
What the... My God.

14:37.102 --> 14:39.903
That bird shit was definitely a sign.

14:45.095 --> 14:46.962
What do you mean postponed?

14:46.964 --> 14:48.363
The storm took a sudden turn,

14:48.365 --> 14:50.031
and we're about to be
in the eye of the hurricane.

14:50.033 --> 14:51.333
You have to reschedule.

14:51.335 --> 14:52.968
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Unhunh.

14:52.970 --> 14:56.104
We will proceed with the wedding
as planned.

14:56.106 --> 14:57.839
Des, I don't think you're
hearing what the man's saying.

14:57.841 --> 14:59.307
He says it can't be done.

14:59.309 --> 15:01.109
Bullshit. Do you hear what I'm saying?

15:01.111 --> 15:03.578
I'm not postponing this wedding
one more day.

15:03.580 --> 15:07.382
Okay, Des. Tell us what you need.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.184
I need all the wedding shit,
I don't know!

15:09.186 --> 15:10.313
Okay. All right.

15:10.338 --> 15:12.154
I need... I need food and flowers and...

15:12.156 --> 15:13.922
- Drinks.
- I don't know!

15:13.924 --> 15:15.757
- Hey, y'all.
- Pol!

15:20.430 --> 15:22.097
What are you doing here?

15:22.099 --> 15:23.498
I couldn't miss this, Des.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.666
They let you out?

15:24.668 --> 15:26.701
Yeah, something like that.

15:26.703 --> 15:29.838
Is, Lillian here with us right now?

15:31.675 --> 15:34.009
Lillian is inside me now.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.880
You may have thought things
were going batshit,

16:11.882 --> 16:14.883
but Desna had something up her weave.

16:22.192 --> 16:24.526
The wire is in the hoodie.

16:24.528 --> 16:26.928
Swap this out for the stuff
Zlata gave you.

16:26.930 --> 16:29.231
It'll knock Ruval out
so you can get away.

16:35.439 --> 16:36.838
Is this how you make those platforms?

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
- Right, right, right.
- For a thing...

16:38.842 --> 16:41.476
- Look what I found.
- Yes.

16:43.981 --> 16:47.682
I just want to say thank you
to y'all for all of this.

16:47.684 --> 16:50.418
Tomorrow is gonna be perfect.

16:55.025 --> 16:56.291
Okay.

17:00.731 --> 17:02.631
It wasn't quite Cinderella,

17:02.633 --> 17:04.132
but will you get a look at that updo?

17:04.134 --> 17:07.435
Look how dewy and buttery she looks.

17:07.436 --> 17:11.272
I was planning on saying
traditional vows,

17:11.275 --> 17:13.407
but I really just want to speak

17:13.410 --> 17:14.976
from my heart if that's all right.

17:14.978 --> 17:18.046
- That's all right.
- All right.

17:18.048 --> 17:24.419
Gregory, you are the most
gentle man I have ever known.

17:24.421 --> 17:26.655
- You are honest.
- Wait, what?

17:26.656 --> 17:28.223
You are generous.

17:28.224 --> 17:32.160
I mean, I thought my years
of dreaming had past.

17:32.162 --> 17:33.895
Y'all know I ain't no spring chicken.

17:33.897 --> 17:36.598
She is really going for it.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.434
But you proved me wrong.

17:39.436 --> 17:44.205
I will honor and cherish you

17:44.207 --> 17:46.674
until the day you die.

17:47.411 --> 17:51.413
Desna, you had me eating out of your hand

17:51.415 --> 17:53.448
the very moment I met you.

17:53.450 --> 17:55.517
You fed me shrimp,
if I remember correctly.

17:56.987 --> 18:01.523
I have never met a woman
with as much strength

18:01.525 --> 18:03.983
and resilience as you.

18:04.628 --> 18:07.162
I will honor and cherish you,

18:07.164 --> 18:13.001
in sickness and health,
until death do us part.

18:13.003 --> 18:16.838
And just like that,
Desna's nightmare came true.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.041
I now pronounce you man and wife.

18:20.043 --> 18:22.530
- It's time for the kiss.
- You may kiss the bride.

18:22.532 --> 18:24.112
Oooh!

18:39.963 --> 18:43.031
Look at this boss bitch
really milking the moment.

18:43.033 --> 18:46.201
I knew Des could act,
but this is pure gold.

18:46.203 --> 18:48.937
Damn. Des put up hard.

18:52.809 --> 18:56.077
Let's live tonight like it's our last.

18:56.680 --> 19:01.216
I'm going to give you
everything your heart desires.

19:04.221 --> 19:05.987
Okay, that was a lot, D.

19:05.989 --> 19:07.555
Did you talk to that salon in Tampa?

19:07.557 --> 19:09.324
- I sure did.
- Yeah, what'd they say?

19:09.326 --> 19:11.493
They said, "Do you want a job?"
after they saw my work,

19:11.495 --> 19:12.827
and I was like, "why, yes, I do".

19:12.829 --> 19:15.263
Well, that sounds like
they have great taste.

19:15.265 --> 19:17.643
Thank you, baby. I'm so excited for me

19:17.668 --> 19:19.501
and you and the girls and a fresh start.

19:19.503 --> 19:22.203
And we'll be two hours
further away from my momma,

19:22.205 --> 19:24.305
and that just seems right.

19:24.307 --> 19:26.174
Wanna have fancy hotel sex?

19:26.176 --> 19:29.444
Yes. God, yes. Come on, baby, come on.

19:29.446 --> 19:31.012
I miss you.

19:31.014 --> 19:33.615
You know I went to the hospital
a bunch of times to apologize,

19:33.617 --> 19:37.419
and they said you
weren't taking any visitors.

19:37.421 --> 19:39.854
I didn't know that you got out.

19:39.856 --> 19:42.357
Yeah. They let me out for this.

19:42.359 --> 19:45.794
- Really?
- No. I snuck out in a nurse's uniform.

19:45.796 --> 19:48.563
What? You snuck out? Is it that bad?

19:48.565 --> 19:50.031
Yeah, it was dull as dirt.

19:50.033 --> 19:53.968
But I needed to be here for my girl Des.

19:54.838 --> 19:56.337
I talked to my boy.

19:56.339 --> 19:59.808
I'ma get you and little Bogdan
up out of this.

19:59.810 --> 20:03.111
- Thank you, Roller.
- It's not your fault, you know?

20:03.113 --> 20:06.081
I was a pawn, you was a pawn.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.217
We deserve better than this.

20:09.219 --> 20:11.653
Now we start fresh together.

20:13.490 --> 20:16.424
- We're good?
- Yeah, yeah. Let me use the head.

20:16.426 --> 20:18.193
Okay.

20:22.966 --> 20:27.235
There's thirsty, and then
there's Russian thirsty.

20:33.910 --> 20:36.511
Roller, what the hell
are you doing in here?

20:36.513 --> 20:37.745
Ruval could see us!

20:37.747 --> 20:40.448
D, I got to talk to you.

20:40.450 --> 20:42.083
Talk about what?

20:42.085 --> 20:44.919
I think Clay killed my father.

20:44.921 --> 20:47.222
- Wh... Wait. What?
- Yeah.

20:47.224 --> 20:48.456
Are you crazy?

20:48.458 --> 20:50.458
I don't know this man, D.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.093
Roller, wait, slow down.

20:52.095 --> 20:53.895
HHHe raised you and Bryce.

20:53.897 --> 20:57.198
He put my mom and dad in the grave.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.466
He didn't raise nothing.

20:58.468 --> 21:00.902
He's a fake, my wife's a fake,

21:00.904 --> 21:04.205
my kid's a fake, D,
your husband's a fake...

21:04.207 --> 21:06.241
Slow down.

21:07.944 --> 21:11.279
You're like the only
real thing in my life.

21:13.550 --> 21:15.650
Um, okay...

21:15.652 --> 21:16.851
Roller, look, look, look.

21:16.853 --> 21:18.720
Everything is gonna be okay, right?

21:18.722 --> 21:21.411
- Yeah.
- We'll figure it out.

21:26.163 --> 21:27.395
Come here.

21:27.397 --> 21:29.063
Mnhmnhmnhmnhmnh.

21:31.668 --> 21:33.735
Roller, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

21:33.737 --> 21:35.470
Wait. Wait!

21:35.472 --> 21:37.505
WWait. Roller, stop!

21:39.576 --> 21:41.075
Roller, st...

21:41.077 --> 21:43.578
Don't st... don't stop.

21:45.682 --> 21:46.915
Shit.

21:52.022 --> 21:55.089
May I please have scotch, neat?

21:57.661 --> 22:00.728
How do you get off?

22:00.730 --> 22:01.963
Did I say that?

22:01.965 --> 22:03.932
Yeah, you just said that.

22:03.934 --> 22:05.300
I meant "when".

22:05.302 --> 22:09.470
Any minute if this weather
gets any worse.

22:09.472 --> 22:11.372
It just got worse.

22:15.278 --> 22:17.611
Hey, Roller.

22:22.219 --> 22:24.652
Shit, where you been? We got work to do.

22:24.654 --> 22:26.884
- Ooh, I'm off duty.
- No, bullshit.

22:26.886 --> 22:29.624
We got to take out that Russian
skank now, you hear me?

22:29.626 --> 22:31.059
She's in the Presidential Suite.

22:31.061 --> 22:33.962
Soon as the shindig dies down,
that's when we move.

22:33.964 --> 22:36.664
Sure. Whatever you say.

22:36.666 --> 22:38.533
What's going on with you lately, boy?

22:38.535 --> 22:39.734
Just been thinking is all.

22:39.736 --> 22:41.703
Aw, well, that's a first.

22:41.705 --> 22:43.738
Why you always call me dumb?

22:43.740 --> 22:46.374
'Cause you act like a dumb idiot
sometimes...

22:46.376 --> 22:47.609
like a lot of times.

22:49.946 --> 22:52.347
All right, shit, you know what?

22:52.349 --> 22:54.082
You ain't dumb, but you just...

22:54.084 --> 22:56.417
you're ruled by your appetites,
you're instinctual,

22:56.419 --> 22:58.630
you're impulsive. You're like a shark.

22:58.632 --> 22:59.687
I'ma give you all some space.

22:59.689 --> 23:01.789
You stay right there, boy.

23:01.791 --> 23:04.759
I don't need no space. Now we wait.

23:11.334 --> 23:12.900
You look so beautiful, Dessie.

23:12.902 --> 23:14.435
Aw, thank you, Dean.

23:14.437 --> 23:16.838
So do you. You look so handsome.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.240
Aw, thanks. Yeah.

23:19.242 --> 23:22.343
I... I just wish this was real for you.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.950
You're real for me, Dean.

23:28.952 --> 23:33.760
- We are real, okay?
- Yeah.

23:33.762 --> 23:36.424
And it's always gon' be like that.

23:36.426 --> 23:38.393
- All right.
- Yeah?

23:38.395 --> 23:41.062
Yeah. Yeah.

23:41.064 --> 23:42.363
I... I don't want
to know about your plan,

23:42.365 --> 23:44.966
but I hope it's going well.

23:44.968 --> 23:47.368
It's going good. I promise you.

23:47.370 --> 23:50.204
Yeah. Okay, um...

23:50.206 --> 23:53.007
II'm sorry, Des. I got to go.

23:53.009 --> 23:54.709
Well, you have fun now.

23:54.711 --> 23:55.977
You...

23:55.979 --> 23:58.212
Do not let him out of that room tonight,

23:58.214 --> 24:00.114
no matter what happens. You got me?

24:00.116 --> 24:02.016
Okay. I got you.

24:02.018 --> 24:03.618
Shit's about to get real.

24:03.620 --> 24:06.721
Realer than any of us could've guessed.

24:06.723 --> 24:08.056
Shall we, Mrs. Ruval?

24:08.058 --> 24:11.526
Ooh. I like the way you say my name.

24:12.962 --> 24:15.229
It's about that time.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.689
Hey, lover.

24:34.691 --> 24:37.125
Hey.

24:39.496 --> 24:42.163
I made us some drinks.

24:44.101 --> 24:46.135
Thank you.

24:47.104 --> 24:50.705
Have I told you how beautiful
you look tonight?

24:50.707 --> 24:52.140
Only a thousand times.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.685
Well, I'll tell you a thousand more.

24:56.847 --> 24:58.272
Come.

24:58.715 --> 24:59.914
Where we going?

24:59.916 --> 25:01.683
I have another surprise for you.

25:01.685 --> 25:02.884
Yeah?

25:09.860 --> 25:13.662
"I've never seen a paper map before."

25:14.498 --> 25:16.798
I'm going to take you to an 11day cruise

25:16.800 --> 25:20.168
through the Caribbean on Matilde's Heart.

25:24.274 --> 25:27.509
I'm gonna show you beaches
that no one knows about,

25:27.511 --> 25:31.305
and we'll go as soon
as the storm clears up.

25:31.848 --> 25:34.249
That's gon' be exciting.

25:34.251 --> 25:35.984
Um...

25:35.986 --> 25:38.119
The drinks are sweating. Let me...

25:38.121 --> 25:41.389
Hey. In a minute.

25:41.391 --> 25:46.494
Desna, I've been waiting
for this moment my whole life.

25:46.496 --> 25:50.498
It is a whole situation

25:50.500 --> 25:53.468
to get out of this dress, so I'm gonna

25:53.470 --> 25:55.870
get out of it and take a quick shower.

25:55.872 --> 25:58.239
Come on. Don't be silly.

25:59.743 --> 26:02.577
I just want everything to be perfect.

26:05.048 --> 26:06.981
Okay.

26:18.795 --> 26:20.628
Come on, boy.
What are we doing in here?

26:20.630 --> 26:22.230
We need to be looking for Zlata.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.631
Tell me the truth.

26:23.633 --> 26:24.966
What... What the hell you

26:24.968 --> 26:26.167
talking about, you idiot?

26:26.169 --> 26:28.069
Call me idiot one more time.

26:28.071 --> 26:30.038
You kill your own brother?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.073
Where the hell you get that from?

26:32.075 --> 26:33.541
You killed my dad.

26:33.543 --> 26:35.463
You tell me the truth.
That's all I want to hear.

26:45.155 --> 26:46.921
Stop lying!

26:53.330 --> 26:55.472
Can't even say it, can you?

26:56.867 --> 26:59.234
I know what you did, Clay.

27:41.077 --> 27:44.412
Take that shit out of your mouth.

27:44.414 --> 27:48.116
Always did have an oral fixation.

27:48.118 --> 27:50.084
You can think of better things to suck on

27:50.086 --> 27:52.217
than that old gun, can't you, Clay?

27:55.458 --> 27:58.126
Why don't you call Toby, baby?

27:58.128 --> 28:00.261
He has such a wonderful penis.

28:05.235 --> 28:06.919
Baby...

28:09.005 --> 28:11.423
You might as well tell Roller.

28:13.076 --> 28:16.477
I can't, baby. I can't.

28:16.479 --> 28:20.390
Free yourself. We had our reasons.

28:21.251 --> 28:24.786
Go end the Russian bitch, big man.

28:24.788 --> 28:27.488
Get your boy back.

28:27.490 --> 28:30.525
There's a storm comin', Clay.

28:30.527 --> 28:33.127
Not this little baby thing
outside, but a big one.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.430
We need you strong.

28:39.035 --> 28:41.636
I'm ready to be with you though, baby.

28:41.638 --> 28:42.996
Not yet.

28:45.408 --> 28:47.642
Not yet, baby.

28:51.448 --> 28:54.115
Hey, I got the master key.

28:54.117 --> 28:55.926
What happened to you, man?

28:56.786 --> 28:58.653
Did Roller do that?

29:01.807 --> 29:03.758
Yeah. We had a disagreement.

29:04.393 --> 29:05.927
That boy's got no respect...

29:05.929 --> 29:07.862
treatin' the man
who raised him like that.

29:07.864 --> 29:09.690
It's a crying shame.

29:11.801 --> 29:13.868
Let's go find that Russian bitch.

29:23.313 --> 29:25.513
Hey, handsome.

29:25.515 --> 29:26.748
Hey.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.501
You haven't had any of your drink.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.187
I want to work up a thirst.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.825
I'm so sorry.

29:37.827 --> 29:39.127
Hello.

29:39.129 --> 29:42.096
This is Olga, Zlata's daughter.

29:42.098 --> 29:44.365
What's on your mind?

29:44.367 --> 29:46.467
Zlata and Desna are working together.

29:48.838 --> 29:50.138
I see.

29:50.140 --> 29:51.940
Desna plans to kill you any minute now,

29:51.942 --> 29:56.511
so maybe don't drink anything.

29:56.513 --> 29:59.414
Also, she loves Roller still.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.983
They do sex in toilet room after service.

30:01.985 --> 30:05.653
That's great news.
Thank you. But you know what?

30:05.655 --> 30:09.557
I just got married, and I have
to back to you next week.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.793
All right.

30:15.909 --> 30:19.251
To us. To us.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.512
I know what you're trying to do.

30:40.397 --> 30:41.763
You really did save the good stuff

30:41.765 --> 30:43.265
for the wedding night?

30:43.267 --> 30:44.733
- Don't come any closer to me.
- Or what?

30:44.735 --> 30:47.202
You don't want to find out.

30:47.204 --> 30:48.737
What happened to you, Gregory?

30:48.739 --> 30:51.039
What made you turn so cold?

30:51.041 --> 30:53.609
Now you want to get to know me?

30:53.611 --> 30:56.380
- You made me love you!
- You wanted to believe.

30:58.182 --> 30:59.681
Don't!

30:59.683 --> 31:02.150
How long have you been
in league with Zlata?

31:02.152 --> 31:03.552
What you gonna do with this?

31:03.554 --> 31:05.420
You gonna stab me? Go ahead.
Stab me! Go ahead!

31:10.361 --> 31:12.661
Even fiercer than I thought.

31:12.663 --> 31:15.107
But you know what? I love you...

31:15.966 --> 31:18.967
but I'm going to kill you
and throw your body in the sea.

31:18.969 --> 31:21.436
You lying sack of shit.

31:21.438 --> 31:22.864
Come on!

31:59.977 --> 32:01.653
Gregory!

32:03.013 --> 32:04.865
Gregory!

32:05.549 --> 32:07.576
Where are you?

32:08.519 --> 32:12.354
Gregoire!

32:23.801 --> 32:26.501
What's happening?
Whatcha drinkin', Polly bird?

32:26.503 --> 32:29.738
I will have another Remy Martin,
thank you.

32:33.110 --> 32:35.020
Cognac for the lady.

32:35.612 --> 32:39.548
Well, I hope this pairs well
with my antipsychotic.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.777
Cheers.

32:42.353 --> 32:43.919
How come we never hang out, Polly?

32:43.921 --> 32:46.588
Well, that's probably 'cause
you're a dirtySouth,

32:46.590 --> 32:49.057
sociopathic, thuglife, countryboy,

32:49.059 --> 32:52.094
meatheaded, sexist Neanderthal.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.362
Yeah, you right.

32:53.364 --> 32:54.596
Nice look, though.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.292
Honey, I'm home!

33:02.439 --> 33:04.508
No. Who shit in your pierogi?

33:05.854 --> 33:07.008
I'm fine.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.910
No, you got that crazy, gloomy,

33:08.912 --> 33:11.480
Russian thing going on.
What's happening, wifey?

33:11.482 --> 33:13.849
- It's nothing.
- Spill the tea, sugar.

33:13.851 --> 33:16.184
We ain't got all night.
Well, actually maybe we do.

33:16.186 --> 33:17.521
I did something.

33:18.856 --> 33:21.323
What did you do, sugar?

33:21.325 --> 33:24.526
I told the Haitian doctor
that Desna is going to kill him.

33:24.528 --> 33:26.828
- You did what?!
- I am sorry.

33:27.931 --> 33:30.265
Desna's not gonna kill him. Zlata is.

33:30.267 --> 33:31.500
There is new plan.

33:31.502 --> 33:34.035
He knows. She is in danger.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.938
We gotta get to her room.
Do you have your gun?

33:36.940 --> 33:38.640
Do crocodiles shit in the woods?

33:38.642 --> 33:40.475
I hope so.

33:42.179 --> 33:43.412
My God.

33:44.715 --> 33:48.583
My God. My God.

33:48.585 --> 33:50.585
Okay, okay, where could she be?

33:50.587 --> 33:52.220
We got to find her. Come on.

33:52.222 --> 33:53.348
Okay.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.133
Is it done?

34:05.135 --> 34:06.268
Somebody called him.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.536
Then outta nowhere,
he attacked me, and I...

34:08.539 --> 34:10.639
But you kill him?

34:10.641 --> 34:12.239
Yeah, but we gotta get out of here.

34:12.242 --> 34:17.112
I mean, I'm sure he got muscle
or some shit around here.

34:17.114 --> 34:18.280
Come on.

34:18.282 --> 34:20.415
Back in the room! Now!

34:20.884 --> 34:22.083
Move!

34:26.308 --> 34:27.591
Okay.

34:29.377 --> 34:31.143
Where is my son?

34:31.146 --> 34:34.214
The front desk called,
and a lady was going in labor,

34:34.216 --> 34:35.782
and Gregory tried to help her.

34:35.784 --> 34:38.784
I saw the room!
It was dripping with blood.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.786
Because she had complications.

34:40.789 --> 34:42.813
Stop the lies!

34:45.594 --> 34:48.904
Shit. You...

34:54.803 --> 34:57.270
Where is my son?

35:01.710 --> 35:03.142
Shit!

35:05.447 --> 35:06.779
She finished.

35:06.781 --> 35:10.250
Now sign over Ruval's properties.

35:10.252 --> 35:12.418
Deep breath. It's okay.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.803
Good.

35:20.028 --> 35:22.595
Des, you need to pick
your friends better.

35:22.597 --> 35:25.815
We knew this bitch
was a nope from the getgo.

35:29.137 --> 35:31.871
You pullin' the gun on me now?

35:31.873 --> 35:33.773
You're only messy part left.

35:36.344 --> 35:41.914
All your "we run the world,
girl power" bullshit...

35:41.916 --> 35:43.583
I believed it.

35:44.252 --> 35:47.687
I believed, too, to certain extent.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.622
I told you what you wanted to hear.

35:49.624 --> 35:51.291
You're thirsty for it.

35:51.293 --> 35:53.693
It was sad, really.

35:53.695 --> 35:56.329
You're a sociopath.

35:56.331 --> 35:58.831
I saw lot of bad shit...

35:58.833 --> 36:01.267
stuff I was too young to see.

36:01.269 --> 36:06.406
And who has time to stop and feel things?

36:06.408 --> 36:07.807
My way works.

36:07.809 --> 36:09.901
You don't have shit.

36:10.412 --> 36:13.713
I have very attractive
real estate portfolio

36:13.715 --> 36:15.181
thanks to dead doctor.

36:15.183 --> 36:18.251
I have thriving pain clinics.

36:18.253 --> 36:21.587
I maybe lost some coke
from Ruval. Who cares?

36:21.589 --> 36:22.989
I already have new source.

36:22.991 --> 36:26.626
Girls are processing right now
at Fond Acres.

36:26.628 --> 36:28.695
I definitely won.

36:28.697 --> 36:30.297
Did you, Zlata?

36:31.633 --> 36:33.341
On your knees.

36:34.769 --> 36:36.336
On your knees now!

36:44.979 --> 36:47.880
I am the last woman
you should underestimate.

36:47.882 --> 36:49.782
Bad move, Desna.

36:58.526 --> 37:01.561
"Sister friend".

37:07.102 --> 37:09.802
Okay.

37:31.726 --> 37:34.327
I win, bitch.

37:54.616 --> 37:57.016
Well, we found Ruval's body.

37:57.018 --> 37:59.018
He tried to kill me.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.720
Arlene, I was fighting for my life

38:00.722 --> 38:02.722
when he fell off that balcony.

38:03.658 --> 38:05.825
We found the mother, too.

38:08.396 --> 38:10.939
Did you get everything
we needed from Zlata?

38:11.666 --> 38:13.775
She confessed to everything.

38:14.736 --> 38:17.537
If this is true, then I'll have the
charges dropped in the morning.

38:17.539 --> 38:18.638
Even if she's dead?

38:18.640 --> 38:21.157
It still helps us
shut down her operation.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.343
What about the salon?

38:24.345 --> 38:27.146
Sorry Desna. The salon is ours now.

38:27.148 --> 38:29.849
Shit.

38:34.355 --> 38:37.824
Dean. Come here. Come over here.

38:40.562 --> 38:44.465
Baby, why... why did you do that?

38:44.490 --> 38:46.057
I... I just wanted to make sure
you were okay,

38:46.059 --> 38:49.060
and clearly somebody needed
to do that, sso I did it.

38:49.696 --> 38:52.029
I never wanted you involved in this,

38:52.031 --> 38:54.298
and I'm so... I'm so sorry.

38:54.300 --> 38:57.601
It was my choice. It's okay. It's okay.

38:57.603 --> 39:00.071
Dean you can't... you can't tell nobody.

39:00.073 --> 39:01.605
You hear me? Look at me.

39:01.607 --> 39:04.809
You can never tell anybody
about this, okay?

39:04.811 --> 39:08.580
I won't. III wouldn't
do anything that stupid.

39:09.294 --> 39:10.373
Okay?

39:11.484 --> 39:13.684
It felt like we lost everything that day,

39:13.686 --> 39:15.925
even the stuff
we never thought we'd lose.

39:27.967 --> 39:29.934
I love you, Polly Marks.

39:30.803 --> 39:33.229
I love you, too, Kenneth Brickman.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.119
I'm okay.

40:25.124 --> 40:28.459
Ms. Desna, Ms. Desna.

40:28.461 --> 40:31.128
Day you've been waiting on
is finally upon us.

40:31.130 --> 40:32.596
Yes, it is.

40:32.598 --> 40:35.900
I've been waiting for this day
a long time, Clay.

40:35.902 --> 40:38.436
Well, bet you have. I know you have.

40:38.438 --> 40:40.588
We're gon' make it real simple for you.

40:41.007 --> 40:44.108
We're gonna use your license
to open up more clinics.

40:44.110 --> 40:48.179
And we'll make it worth
your while on a onetime,

40:48.181 --> 40:50.139
perclinic basis.

40:51.384 --> 40:54.519
No profitparticipation.

40:55.441 --> 40:57.105
No deal.

40:58.558 --> 41:01.559
Now, Ms. Desna, I promised Clint here

41:01.561 --> 41:04.528
a piece of the pie after we got
things all squared away.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.996
First of all, I just want to say

41:05.998 --> 41:07.898
I really love what you did
at that hotel...

41:07.900 --> 41:09.784
Shh, shh, shh.

41:11.204 --> 41:14.914
I like pie. I like it a lot.

41:15.541 --> 41:18.835
The only thing that's better
than a piece of the pie

41:20.446 --> 41:22.755
is the whole pie, Clay.

41:26.919 --> 41:29.587
You need to think about what
you're saying there, Ms. Desna.

41:29.589 --> 41:31.889
I have thought about it.

41:31.891 --> 41:35.392
I thought, "What if...
What if I had a boss"

41:35.394 --> 41:38.362
that actually got me?"

41:38.364 --> 41:42.700
One who valued me, respected me.

41:42.702 --> 41:45.035
Hell, taught me something.

41:45.037 --> 41:50.674
And then I realized I know more
about running this shit

41:50.676 --> 41:52.994
than all you idiots put together.

41:54.580 --> 41:57.248
Boy, you need to get
your woman here in check.

41:58.618 --> 42:01.044
I don't take orders from you, Clay.

42:02.088 --> 42:03.754
Not anymore.

42:03.756 --> 42:06.049
She's exactly where she need to be.

42:07.827 --> 42:11.304
Whatcha got to say now, Clay?

42:12.031 --> 42:14.131
No matter what happened between
you and me, boy,

42:14.133 --> 42:15.475
we still family.

42:18.858 --> 42:20.396
Later, D.

42:29.649 --> 42:33.534
Thank you for underestimating me.

42:34.287 --> 42:36.353
That shit taught me a lot.

42:40.393 --> 42:42.585
Now get out of my face.

43:15.474 --> 43:16.786
Let's ride.

43:18.510 --> 43:22.834
It was like in that moment,
Des finally saw me.

43:23.682 --> 43:27.117
After Ruval, the cops, losing the salon,

43:27.119 --> 43:28.852
we were the only two left.

43:32.558 --> 43:34.625
Desna helped Mandy get her act together.

43:34.627 --> 43:38.495
And in return, Mandy found
Desna one more slice of pie.

43:38.497 --> 43:41.732
All right, so, I
looked into Ruval's portfolio,

43:41.734 --> 43:43.442
as you requested.

43:43.444 --> 43:46.837
- And he left this in your name.
- Wait, what?

43:52.311 --> 43:54.444
I got a casino? I got a casino!

43:54.446 --> 43:57.014
- Casino, girl!
- Want to go check it out?

43:57.016 --> 43:59.149
YYeah. Give us just a minute.

43:59.151 --> 44:01.952
All right. I'll be at the roulette table.

44:01.954 --> 44:04.187
You rich, bitch!

44:04.189 --> 44:06.757
We rich, bitch! My God!

44:06.759 --> 44:09.377
Dean is not gonna believe this.
Virginia, we got to call him.

44:09.379 --> 44:11.029
This right here is everything

44:11.054 --> 44:12.573
that I ever promised him.

44:21.907 --> 44:23.874
Shit. Des, get down.

44:29.915 --> 44:32.149
Shit, shit.

44:32.151 --> 44:34.418
Shit! Virginia!

44:34.420 --> 44:37.254
Why'd I do it? Because I love her.

44:37.256 --> 44:41.491
She's the mother I never had,
the friend I always wanted,

44:41.493 --> 44:43.717
and the sister I guess I had to earn.

44:43.719 --> 44:45.028
Somebody help me!

44:45.030 --> 44:47.598
Virginia! Help me!

44:47.599 --> 44:49.666
Never knew you loved me
this much, did you, Des?
