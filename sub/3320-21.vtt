00:02.698 --> 00:03.828
Previously onMom...

00:03.916 --> 00:05.396
[phone vibrates]Hello?

00:05.483 --> 00:06.963
BONNIE:
Christy.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.617
Where are you?

00:08.704 --> 00:10.619
Uh... uh...

00:10.706 --> 00:12.403
I'’m in jail.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.449
Oh, God.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.754
Are you okay?

00:15.841 --> 00:19.149
Yeah, just got a DUI.

00:19.236 --> 00:22.196
How could you let me
spend a night in jail?

00:22.283 --> 00:24.807
How could you lie to me
about getting loaded again?!

00:24.894 --> 00:26.156
It'’s not my fault.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.158
I was prescribed
those painkillers.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.204
I am the victim here.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.554
How'’d you blow a one-one
on the Breathalyzer?

00:32.641 --> 00:35.992
Easy, I was drinking to forget
I was hooked on painkillers.

00:41.302 --> 00:44.522
I really appreciate
you coming with me.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.350
Hey, it'’s like the old days,

00:46.437 --> 00:48.178
except you didn'’t have
to write me a note

00:48.265 --> 00:50.572
to get me out of school.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.835
Do you think your lawyer friend
knows what he'’s doing?

00:52.922 --> 00:57.013
He'’s had three DUIs himself,
and he'’s not in jail, so yeah.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.755
Good news.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.975
I took a whiz next to the
judge-- he doesn'’t remember me.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.327
Also he'’s doing this for free.

01:06.414 --> 01:09.895
So, listen, I spoke to the D.A.
and got the charges reduced

01:09.982 --> 01:11.419
from DUI to reckless driving,

01:11.506 --> 01:13.160
which means you can get
your license back,

01:13.247 --> 01:15.423
and you only have to do
20 hours of community service.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.642
20 hours?
Mm.

01:17.729 --> 01:20.515
Can'’t you go back to the men'’s
room and get it down to ten?

01:20.602 --> 01:23.735
Hey, I'’m a two-bit lawyer,
not a two-bit whore.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.998
Some might call that
"potato-potato."

01:26.086 --> 01:28.088
Trust me,
this is a good deal.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.568
All you have to do is tell
the judge you'’re very sorry,

01:30.655 --> 01:32.570
and it'’ll never happen again.

01:32.657 --> 01:35.443
But when do I get a chance
to tell my side of the story?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.532
Here'’s what you do:
go down to the park,

01:37.619 --> 01:40.491
find a homeless guy,
give him a sandwich,

01:40.578 --> 01:43.581
and while he'’s eating,
tell himyour side of the story.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.366
You'’re not taking
me seriously.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.498
No fooling you.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.587
Mom, just do what he says.But the thing is...

01:49.674 --> 01:51.633
Here comes the thing--
she always has a thing.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.723
The thing is, I was
prescribed those painkillers.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.551
Mom, Mom.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.683
"I'’m very sorry.
It will never happen again."

01:58.770 --> 01:59.989
Okay, okay.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.643
Bonnie Plunkett?Here we go.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.732
Present, Your Honor.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.952
Miss Plunkett, I see here
that you are pleading guilty

02:07.039 --> 02:08.737
to the lesser charge
of reckless driving.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.782
That'’s correct,
Your Honor.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.307
Is there anything you have
to say before I sentence you?

02:18.790 --> 02:21.532
I'’m very sorry, and it
will never happen again.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.709
But the thing is...

02:24.796 --> 02:26.494
Son of a bitch.

02:26.581 --> 02:29.018
I was prescribed highly
addictive painkillers

02:29.105 --> 02:31.151
for a back injury,

02:31.238 --> 02:33.892
so in a way,
I am the victim of Big Pharma.

02:33.979 --> 02:34.850
Say good-bye to your mother.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.088
How was school today?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.089
Fine.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.178
How was court?

02:59.396 --> 03:01.006
You told him?

03:01.093 --> 03:02.834
Why not? I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.401
Yes, you do.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.666
It'’s not Grandma'’s fault,
it'’s a big farmer.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.366
Big Pharma.

03:12.453 --> 03:13.541
That'’s what I said.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.675
Let'’s [clears throat]
change the subject.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.199
How'’d you do on your math test?

03:19.286 --> 03:21.244
I got a hundred.Way to go!

03:21.331 --> 03:24.160
That'’s also how many hours
Grandma has to pick up trash

03:24.247 --> 03:26.380
on the side of the highway.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.209
I thought we were changing
the subject.
You'’re right.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.211
Grandma also lost
her driver'’s license.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.257
Did you check under the couch?

03:34.344 --> 03:35.824
I find lots of stuff
under there.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.219
Why don'’t you go look?Okay.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.702
All right, let'’s have it.

03:44.789 --> 03:47.357
You had to give a speech.
You couldn'’t have just said,

03:47.444 --> 03:49.359
"I'’m sorry.
It'’ll never happen again."

03:49.446 --> 03:52.449
Now I have to do all the grocery
shopping, all the errands.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.451
I have to drive
and pick him up from school.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.366
I can'’t count on you
for anything.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.977
Hey, to be fair, I don'’t really
do much around here now.

03:59.064 --> 04:03.243
Hey, I make the jokes
about how much you suck.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.419
ROSCOE:
I found 37 cents!

04:05.506 --> 04:07.899
Give it to Grandma;
she'’ll need it for the bus!

04:09.684 --> 04:10.815
That'’s one of my jokes.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.863
Hi, I'’m Regina.
I'’m an alcoholic.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.430
OTHERS:
Hi, Regina.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.127
I just want to say real quick

04:18.214 --> 04:20.521
how much gratitude
is in my heart.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.392
When I woke up this morning,

04:22.479 --> 04:24.829
I opened my eyes,
still thinking I was in jail.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.963
But I was in a king-sized bed
in a million-dollar mansion,

04:28.050 --> 04:30.922
and I knew I had
one person to thank.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.924
Jesus Christ.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.320
Maybe you should
thank the person

04:37.407 --> 04:40.280
who bought the bed
and the mansion.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.282
You mean your ex-husband?

04:45.850 --> 04:46.938
That'’s all I got.

04:47.025 --> 04:47.939
Thank you.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.985
[applause]

04:50.072 --> 04:51.682
Okay, who'’d like
to go next?

04:51.769 --> 04:53.467
I'’ll go.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.382
Hi, I'’m Bonnie, and
I'’m an alcoholic.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.992
OTHERS:
Hi, Bonnie.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.299
Today, I have five days sober.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.870
What, no applause?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.698
Brrr, chilly.

05:09.831 --> 05:12.486
It'’s not easy to say this,

05:12.573 --> 05:16.141
but I lied to
you guys a lot.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.448
Even about stuff
I didn'’t have to.

05:18.535 --> 05:21.495
And I'’m not proud about that.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.498
I mean, I'’m proud of
how well-crafted the lies were,

05:24.585 --> 05:27.849
because, you know, doing
anything well is its own reward,

05:27.936 --> 05:29.677
but your trust

05:29.764 --> 05:33.507
means a lot to me,
and I'’m very sorry.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.117
It'’ll never happen again.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.640
"But the thing is..."

05:36.727 --> 05:37.902
But the thing is...

05:39.600 --> 05:41.558
...it'’s not all my fault.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.561
I mean, the doctors,
the pharmaceutical companies,

05:44.648 --> 05:46.694
the rehab centers--
they'’re all in cahoots.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.653
I would not be surprised if
my back injury was the result

05:49.740 --> 05:51.525
of showering
in a bathtub

05:51.612 --> 05:53.831
that was purposely designed
to make you fall.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.703
I don'’t mean to sound paranoid,

05:55.790 --> 05:57.531
but we might be
looking at a giant

05:57.618 --> 06:00.142
pharmaceutical-medical-plumbing
conspiracy.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.579
Are we allowed to boo?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.322
Anyway, that'’s it.

06:06.409 --> 06:09.978
Put those daisy stickers down
in your tub, otherwise they win.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.284
Okay.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.677
Who else would like to share?

06:13.764 --> 06:14.983
I would.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.550
Hi, I'’m Christy.

06:16.637 --> 06:17.725
I'’m an alcoholic.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.596
OTHERS:
Hi, Christy.

06:19.683 --> 06:23.992
I just want to say how grateful
I am to this program,

06:24.079 --> 06:27.604
because without it,
I would have murdered my mother.

06:30.041 --> 06:34.219
And, you know, people
toss around the word "murder"

06:34.306 --> 06:37.571
all too easy these days...

06:37.658 --> 06:40.356
but I really mean it.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.707
Thank you.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.143
[applause]

06:48.277 --> 06:50.018
Okay, anybody else?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.715
I'’ll go.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.587
Hi, Marjorie, alcoholic.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.197
OTHERS:
Hi, Marjorie.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.025
Well, as many of you know,

06:57.112 --> 07:00.681
I'’ve been battling cancer
for the past 18 months,

07:00.768 --> 07:03.379
and today I went
to my oncologist

07:03.466 --> 07:06.730
to get the results
of my latest scan.

07:06.817 --> 07:10.038
And I'’m happy to report
that I'’m cancer-free.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.909
[gasping]

07:11.996 --> 07:13.868
[cheering]

07:17.262 --> 07:21.223
All right, let'’s just you and me
put aside our differences

07:21.310 --> 07:24.139
and make tonight about
celebrating Marjorie'’s recovery.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.923
Hey, I'’m not the one
seething with resentment.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.230
Quite true--
you'’re too busy creating it.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.320
You'’re a carrier.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.583
You'’re patient zero
of the human resentment virus.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.629
I'’m confused.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.892
Are we setting aside
our differences, or aren'’t we?

07:39.023 --> 07:40.068
We are.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.461
Truce?Truce.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.246
There she is.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.595
Our little miracle.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.728
MARJORIE:
Thanks, guys.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.817
So now that you'’re cancer-free,
got any exciting plans?

07:49.904 --> 07:51.514
Well, I guess there'’s no reason

07:51.601 --> 07:52.994
to put off
painting the porch anymore.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.953
I could do
that for you.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.041
Really?

07:57.128 --> 07:58.782
Aw, thanks, Bonnie.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.349
That doesn'’t count
as community service, Mom.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.003
I'’m doing it out of friendship.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.005
And if she signs the forms,
yes, it does.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.836
So, how long will it take
for your hair to grow back?

08:08.923 --> 08:11.447
This is my hair.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.363
Looks great.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.498
[crying]

08:18.585 --> 08:20.543
Wendy, why are
you crying?

08:20.630 --> 08:23.024
I made a deal with God
that if he let you live,

08:23.111 --> 08:25.679
I'’d spend the rest of my life
helping the poor.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.159
Oh, honey, why is that sad?

08:28.246 --> 08:30.118
I don'’t want to do it.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.034
Everybody stop looking at me.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.212
How about a toast
to Marjorie?

08:37.299 --> 08:38.299
We don'’t have drinks yet.

08:38.386 --> 08:39.736
Fake it.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.086
Come on, everybody,
let'’s pretend.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.306
Marjorie, you are the most
amazing woman I'’ve ever known.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.221
[Bonnie clears throat]

08:46.308 --> 08:48.615
Did you really think you were
in the running for that?

08:50.965 --> 08:53.837
Even when you were sick,
you were always our rock.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.709
And I just want you to know,

08:55.796 --> 08:58.146
we all love you, and...

08:58.233 --> 08:59.582
we'’re so happy

08:59.669 --> 09:01.279
you'’re gonna stick around
with us

09:01.366 --> 09:02.454
for a long, long time.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.847
Hear, hear.Cheers.

09:12.813 --> 09:15.119
I pretended there was
alcohol in mine.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.732
Now that you'’re
on the other side of this,

09:18.819 --> 09:20.777
you should travel,
see the world.

09:20.864 --> 09:23.432
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'’m gonna do just that.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.608
My fella wants to take me
on a cruise.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.436
Ugh, those cruise
ships are awful.

09:27.523 --> 09:28.872
Nobody really cares
what you think.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.613
She just got healthy.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.049
Those things are like
floating petri dishes.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.269
Stop telling people
how to live their lives,

09:34.356 --> 09:35.879
when you can'’t even figure out
how to live your own life.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.055
I live my life just fine.

09:38.142 --> 09:41.102
Really? 52-year-old woman
without a driver'’s license,

09:41.189 --> 09:42.669
wearing an orange vest,
picking up garbage

09:42.756 --> 09:44.279
on the side of the road.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.150
Yeah, you knocked your life
out of the park.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.065
Oh, oh.
Okay, so you with the two kids

09:48.152 --> 09:49.850
and the two different dads,

09:49.937 --> 09:51.547
drops out of high school,
fails at stripping.

09:51.634 --> 09:52.853
I mean, seriously,
who fails at stripping?

09:52.940 --> 09:54.289
It'’s taking off your clothes.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.555
Oh, yeah? You want to bet which
one of us has a better life?

09:59.642 --> 10:01.513
I'’m sure you do-- you'’re
the one with a cookie commitment

10:01.601 --> 10:02.558
at Gamblers Anonymous.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.909
What the hell was that?

10:05.996 --> 10:07.345
That'’s me throwing
my imaginary drink

10:07.432 --> 10:08.346
in your face.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.478
Ooh.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.522
Stop it!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.872
Both of you, just shut up.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.614
You'’re ruining my remission.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.094
FYI, our truce is over.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.228
That was a truce?

10:27.409 --> 10:28.584
[line beeps]

10:28.671 --> 10:30.934
Hi, Marjorie, it'’s me.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.980
Maybe you'’re still asleep.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.636
Anyway, I just wanted
to apologize for last night.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.942
I'’m so happy you'’re healthy.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.292
That is the greatest news.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.644
And please know I don'’t
expect you to take sides

10:44.731 --> 10:47.298
in this thing
between me and my mother.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.475
But you get what'’s going on.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.524
Morning.

10:56.525 --> 10:57.831
Mm-hmm.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.184
Who were you
talking to so early?

11:03.271 --> 11:04.533
Marjorie.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.187
She and I are good.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.842
Mm-hmm.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.285
Seriously?

11:17.372 --> 11:19.287
I might have liked a second cup.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.420
I might have liked my youth
uninterrupted by childbirth.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.423
Now, if you'’ll excuse me,

11:25.510 --> 11:27.077
I'’m off to pick up
dirty diapers,

11:27.164 --> 11:29.514
used condoms and Big Gulps
filled with urine.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.256
And whose fault is that, Mom?

11:32.343 --> 11:34.737
I'’m assuming
long-haul truckers.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.260
It'’s never you, is it?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.914
I have never peed in a cup

11:38.001 --> 11:39.611
unless it was ordered
by the court.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.790
Before you go,

11:43.877 --> 11:45.879
tonight'’s the night
we'’re supposed to go over

11:45.966 --> 11:47.402
to Violet and Gregory'’s
for dinner.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.360
That'’s tonight?Yeah.

11:49.447 --> 11:52.059
Do we both have to go?
And by that, I mean you.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.670
I am her mother.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.846
Yes, but I'’m the one she likes.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.196
Okay, look.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.546
This is a big night for Violet.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.723
Let'’s you and I
put our differences aside

12:03.810 --> 12:05.420
and make it a good experience
for her.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.204
I can do that. Can you?

12:07.291 --> 12:08.379
You couldn'’t do it last night.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.077
Oh, so last night was my fault?

12:10.164 --> 12:11.600
Marjorie thinks so.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.822
Let me tell you
something, blondie.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.825
I may have made mistakes
in my life, but you--

12:18.912 --> 12:21.741
you sit there on your high horse
judging everybody.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.830
Not everybody, Mom. Just you.

12:23.917 --> 12:27.442
Wow, how did you become a person
with so little compassion?

12:27.529 --> 12:28.573
Easy.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.184
I spent my formative years

12:30.271 --> 12:32.403
with the most self-obsessed
woman on Earth.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.884
Oh, please, I barely saw you
when you were growing up.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.149
Oh, my God!

12:39.236 --> 12:41.151
Do you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?!

12:41.238 --> 12:43.327
I-I know our
neighbors can.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.025
All I said was

12:45.112 --> 12:47.331
if Gregory'’s mother
comes to live with them,

12:47.418 --> 12:48.898
they can say
good-bye to sex!

12:48.985 --> 12:50.421
They'’re getting married!

12:50.508 --> 12:52.772
They can say good-bye
to sex either way!

12:53.860 --> 12:56.123
I am so sorry about...

12:56.210 --> 12:58.473
Uh, y-you don'’t have
to keep apologizing.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.258
Mother-daughter relationships
are often quite challenging.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.217
Challenging?

13:03.304 --> 13:06.960
Does your mom have a rap sheet
in California, Arizona,

13:07.047 --> 13:10.746
West Virginia and-- I am not
making this up-- Micronesia?

13:12.269 --> 13:14.532
Um, n-not that I know of.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.708
Listen, we'’re so glad
you two could

13:16.796 --> 13:18.275
join us tonight.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.886
Violet worked very
hard on preparing

13:19.973 --> 13:21.844
a traditional
Shabbat dinner.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.020
Shabbat?It'’s Jewish for Friday.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.674
Right?

13:25.761 --> 13:27.110
C-Close enough.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.897
The reason we asked
you to come over,

13:30.984 --> 13:33.029
other than the joy of
getting to know you better,

13:33.116 --> 13:34.683
is, uh...

13:34.770 --> 13:36.467
Violet has some news.

13:36.554 --> 13:39.035
You'’re pregnant?

13:39.122 --> 13:40.558
Why do you always
jump to that?

13:40.645 --> 13:41.951
Oh, like you weren'’t
thinking it.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.388
Of course I was!

13:44.475 --> 13:47.043
But unlike you, I don'’t
vomit out the first words

13:47.130 --> 13:49.219
that pop into
my drug-addled brain!

13:49.306 --> 13:52.875
Hey! Clean and
sober six days.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.355
Mazel tov.

13:56.313 --> 13:59.316
I made the dean'’s list.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.362
And I hate you both.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.321
Excuse me.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.498
20 years of therapy,
and all it took

14:07.585 --> 14:09.370
was an hour and a half
with you two

14:09.457 --> 14:10.850
to make me love my mother.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.816
He certainly has
a lovely condo.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.339
Yeah.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.994
Shame we'’ll never see it again.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.738
Is there any chance
you and I can

14:29.825 --> 14:31.566
clean the slate and start over?

14:31.653 --> 14:32.915
I'’d like that.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.047
Yeah.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.352
[sighs]
Good.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.745
Me, too.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.529
How is this gonna work?

14:38.616 --> 14:41.271
Well, uh...

14:41.358 --> 14:43.578
first, I'’d say
we stop beating each other up

14:43.665 --> 14:44.927
for what'’s in the past.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.276
[groans]

14:46.363 --> 14:47.930
That'’s a tough one.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.498
I really enjoy that.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.195
I know.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.849
What are we gonna
talk about?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.416
Beats me.

14:55.503 --> 14:58.375
That "shabit" dinner
was kind of weird.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.292
Not "shabit."
Shabbat.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.077
I'’m pretty sure it'’s "shabit."

15:06.688 --> 15:08.603
Well, whatever you call it,

15:08.690 --> 15:11.388
the carrots were the only thing
on my plate that I recognized.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.306
See? We don'’t have
to pick on each other,

15:16.393 --> 15:18.265
we can pick on other people.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.570
Sure can.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.659
[laughs]

15:21.746 --> 15:24.010
You think we should circle back

15:24.097 --> 15:26.142
to Violet and Gregory'’s
and apologize?

15:26.229 --> 15:28.318
I don'’t know.
I think we should

15:28.405 --> 15:31.843
give them both
a little time to stop crying.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.194
What do you say
we stop by Marjorie'’s

15:34.281 --> 15:36.587
and apologize for ruining
the celebration last night?

15:36.674 --> 15:38.720
Yeah, definitely.

15:38.807 --> 15:39.808
Love you, Mom.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.463
Love you, daughter.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.160
[chuckles]

15:44.247 --> 15:45.727
What?

15:45.814 --> 15:47.337
I can'’t think of anything

15:47.424 --> 15:49.252
to say to you
that'’s not mean.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.476
I'’m really proud of us for
making this apology to Marjorie.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.435
It'’s smart, too-- we may have to
borrow money from her someday.

I'’m the one

No, you told me
to call everybody
