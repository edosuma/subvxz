00:14.808 --> 00:19.211
âª All alone, the broadening skies âª

00:19.211 --> 00:23.437
âª Under thee, every night, I lie âª

00:23.437 --> 00:27.837
âª Scratch and claw and grip the rails âª

00:27.837 --> 00:32.054
âª Every day, my living hell âª

00:32.054 --> 00:37.054
âª Oh God, you know I've tried âª

00:38.529 --> 00:43.529
âª I know how hard I've tried âª

00:44.212 --> 00:47.379
âª You know I've tried âª

01:05.659 --> 01:06.492
Hello?

01:06.492 --> 01:07.325
Hello, Shannon?

01:07.325 --> 01:08.250
Hi.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.083
How are you doing?

01:09.083 --> 01:09.916
I'm sleepy.

01:09.916 --> 01:12.030
Sleepy? All right.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.633
Well, I'll try and keep it simple then.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.390
Let's see. First of all, how old are you?

01:19.572 --> 01:20.772
I'm 25.

01:20.772 --> 01:25.772
25. Okay.

01:38.114 --> 01:40.947
(camera clatters)

01:46.447 --> 01:47.780
Hey.

01:59.035 --> 01:59.868
Hey.

02:02.553 --> 02:04.553
I do too. I gotta sleep.

02:07.144 --> 02:10.087
I will be checking out at three, though.

02:10.087 --> 02:14.087
Because we're going to mix the John Lennon song.

02:16.382 --> 02:18.549
What time is it right now?

02:21.487 --> 02:24.746
(country music)

02:24.746 --> 02:27.163
(baby cries)

02:30.040 --> 02:32.457
(vocalizing)

02:38.254 --> 02:40.754
(music stops)

02:54.255 --> 02:56.672
(vocalizing)

03:03.941 --> 03:06.019
Lisa.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.566
(laughing)

03:07.566 --> 03:09.165
Hurry!

03:09.165 --> 03:11.348
(laughing)

03:11.348 --> 03:14.098
(tape rewinding)

03:37.914 --> 03:40.581
(country music)

03:46.842 --> 03:49.991
Back in Lafayette.

03:49.991 --> 03:52.153
We're cruising out in the county.

03:52.153 --> 03:53.736
Indiana. Open road.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.407
The Amish part of town.

03:59.896 --> 04:00.729
See.

04:13.070 --> 04:15.073
I went to the dentist today.

04:15.073 --> 04:15.906
My fucking

04:16.993 --> 04:18.282
gums are all swollen,

04:18.282 --> 04:20.482
my whole side of my face right here is numb.

04:22.140 --> 04:25.457
But anyway, what I'm getting at is that

04:25.457 --> 04:28.410
I'm doing the video camera work here, so,

04:28.410 --> 04:29.830
and driving.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.560
Trying to keep my focus.

04:32.783 --> 04:33.866
And you know,

04:37.370 --> 04:39.050
I probably get more out of...

04:41.670 --> 04:43.583
more out of it than you do.

04:59.030 --> 05:01.480
Let's see your earrings.
Mom, mom.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.163
Oh my God, Shannon.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.330
Holy...

05:08.330 --> 05:10.920
Oh, hon, why did you have such big holes

05:10.920 --> 05:12.360
put in your ears?

05:12.360 --> 05:13.193
Am I on...

05:13.193 --> 05:14.803
Is this on?

05:21.520 --> 05:23.480
Can I have a cigarette while we're in here?

05:23.480 --> 05:25.819
If I can smoke a bowl.

05:25.819 --> 05:27.410
Hell, no.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.243
Oh, shoot, dad, give me a,

05:28.243 --> 05:29.220
do me a favor.

05:29.220 --> 05:30.070
Grab that camera.

05:37.110 --> 05:39.650
Right there is the house of a judge.

05:39.650 --> 05:42.593
He's shied me since I was about 13 years old.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.290
Here's my senior picture over there.

05:45.290 --> 05:46.123
Where's Lisa?

05:46.123 --> 05:48.110
Yeah, where'd my girlfriend go?

05:52.111 --> 05:53.160
You suck.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.313
Stop it, Shannon.

05:55.753 --> 05:56.618
Turn it off.

05:56.618 --> 05:59.368
I hate people with video cameras.

06:00.752 --> 06:02.048
Turn it off.

06:02.048 --> 06:03.460
(laughing)

06:03.460 --> 06:04.500
My girlfriend, Lisa,

06:04.500 --> 06:06.987
we've been together for like 10 years.

06:06.987 --> 06:08.270
Went to senior prom together,

06:08.270 --> 06:10.883
all that sweet Midwest bullshit.

06:11.830 --> 06:12.663
Say hi.

06:13.620 --> 06:14.540
Say hi!

06:14.540 --> 06:15.827
Hi.

06:15.827 --> 06:16.720
That's Lisa.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.753
This is her dad we're going to watch.

06:21.667 --> 06:25.917
There's another competitor right there.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.970
Look at that.

06:30.970 --> 06:33.280
He's just pulling the shit out of that thing.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.079
Good job, Shane.

06:36.079 --> 06:37.162
Good driving.

07:03.681 --> 07:06.598
(guitar strumming)

07:22.902 --> 07:26.506
âª All that I feel is the air that I breathe, âª

07:26.506 --> 07:30.131
âª All that I need are the things I don't need âª

07:30.131 --> 07:35.131
âª All that really matters is what matters to me âª

07:39.468 --> 07:41.419
I never took singing seriously until

07:41.419 --> 07:45.480
I graduated from high school and reality hit me in the face

07:45.480 --> 07:48.310
that I didn't, you know, I didn't really want to go

07:48.310 --> 07:49.420
to college.

07:49.420 --> 07:53.370
I worked in the local factory job in Lafayette.

07:53.370 --> 07:56.980
I kind of had backed myself into a corner and wanted to move

07:56.980 --> 07:58.050
out of Indiana

07:58.050 --> 08:01.733
because I just was getting into much trouble there.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.170
I also brought...

08:08.100 --> 08:09.983
some mushrooms, ladies and gentlemen.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.193
Yes, moldy ass,

08:14.770 --> 08:16.123
yucky looking mushrooms.

08:20.345 --> 08:21.178
My god.

08:24.063 --> 08:26.730
(tongue clicks)

08:28.469 --> 08:32.552
Maybe I'll see (unintelligible).

08:34.358 --> 08:35.540
Maybe I won't.

08:35.540 --> 08:38.420
Maybe you ought to just mind your own fucking business.

08:38.420 --> 08:40.120
Maybe that's what you ought to do.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.380
See, there's no one here.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.520
So you're the only person I have to talk to.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.433
I'm quite bored, and I love to talk.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.580
I was being very self destructive.

08:57.890 --> 09:00.450
I'm preparing to go get this hand x-rayed again.

09:00.450 --> 09:02.423
For the second time.

09:03.650 --> 09:07.580
First time I hurt it, I hit the wall

09:08.920 --> 09:10.783
because I gacked out a note.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.630
The second time I hurt it was just the other night,

09:14.630 --> 09:18.950
keeping myself from hitting a gacked out guitar player.

09:18.950 --> 09:22.623
Instead I hit the wall, but the pain is still subsiding.

09:24.140 --> 09:25.900
I'm going to go to Saint Elizabeth Hospital,

09:25.900 --> 09:27.063
where I was born.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.313
Get it x-rayed.

09:32.977 --> 09:37.560
You know you're supposed to wear that when you work.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.060
Well, I'm working.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.610
Being in the presence of you and mom arguing

09:43.610 --> 09:44.597
is a job.

09:44.597 --> 09:47.264
Your mother and I don't argue.

10:11.076 --> 10:13.909
Channel 17, all right.

10:17.137 --> 10:19.107
Hi, I'm Tabitha Soren, with MTV news.

10:19.107 --> 10:21.730
We've got a cyber stuff report for you, now.

10:21.730 --> 10:24.920
The Beatles 1965 classic, "A Hard Day's Night,"

10:24.920 --> 10:27.490
Has now been playing on a computer near you.

10:27.490 --> 10:29.640
"A Hard Day's Night" is the first feature film

10:29.640 --> 10:32.930
to be released on a computer CD-ROM disc.

10:32.930 --> 10:35.880
You know, MTV needs to leave the Beatles alone.

10:39.460 --> 10:42.090
Where I was raised, TV was about the only thing

10:42.090 --> 10:44.150
that I really had to show me what

10:44.150 --> 10:46.037
the outside world was about.

10:48.617 --> 10:50.731
The big bands and the small bands you

10:50.731 --> 10:54.981
wanted to see they never even came to our hometown.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.730
I wanted to see it all hands-on,

11:01.730 --> 11:05.640
and Los Angeles is definitely a place to see a lot of

11:05.640 --> 11:06.553
what's going on.

11:12.150 --> 11:13.520
I went to Hollywood searching

11:13.520 --> 11:16.650
for them dreams that everybody says comes true.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.495
(in Spanish) He's recording!

11:28.495 --> 11:29.328
Hmm?

11:29.328 --> 11:33.745
(in Spanish) He's recording.

11:36.860 --> 11:40.046
Hey Brad, what's that band you're in?

11:40.046 --> 11:41.543
I don't know yet.

11:41.543 --> 11:42.865
Okay, bye.

11:42.865 --> 11:43.698
Bye.

11:43.698 --> 11:46.615
(guitar strumming)

11:50.892 --> 11:53.060
This is Hollywood Boulevard,

11:53.060 --> 11:54.930
because we don't have snow out here,

11:54.930 --> 11:58.200
we have these things all over the streets.

11:59.123 --> 12:02.268
As you can see we can walk right out here in traffic,

12:02.268 --> 12:03.912
right out here, just about to get hit

12:03.912 --> 12:05.499
by cars and shit.

12:05.499 --> 12:08.499
(harmonica playing)

12:10.474 --> 12:14.740
âª I don't feel the sun's coming out today. âª

12:14.740 --> 12:16.859
âª It's staying in âª

12:16.859 --> 12:20.900
âª It's going to find another way âª

12:20.900 --> 12:21.767
I met Rogers and Brad, like,

12:21.767 --> 12:23.600
the first month that I moved there.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.480
We hit it off pretty good.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.303
We had a lot in common.

12:27.303 --> 12:30.339
âª I don't think I'll ever, no, Lord âª

12:30.339 --> 12:33.672
âª See the sun from here âª

12:35.286 --> 12:37.536
(cheering)

12:39.536 --> 12:41.276
Hey, Shannon.

12:41.276 --> 12:43.114
Oh, there he is.

12:43.114 --> 12:45.310
We're all from very much

12:45.310 --> 12:46.858
repressed environments

12:46.858 --> 12:48.530
(chuckling)

12:48.530 --> 12:52.927
Very small town, community backgrounds.

12:52.927 --> 12:54.330
Okay guys, here's a question.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.840
What are you each going to do with your first million?

12:56.840 --> 12:57.673
Buy lobster.

12:57.673 --> 13:00.040
I'm going to buy my lawyers off, back home.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.441
I'm going to buy this pool.

13:02.441 --> 13:03.438
(cheering)

13:03.438 --> 13:06.494
Pressure's on you, Rog.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.911
(rock music)

13:10.239 --> 13:14.187
âª Now you see, I'm watching everything I do âª

13:14.187 --> 13:16.361
âª And they're watching everything I say âª

13:16.361 --> 13:21.138
âª So they will leave me be âª

13:21.138 --> 13:24.138
âª Whoa, leave me be âª

13:25.760 --> 13:27.840
Unity is something that I've held sacred.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.310
My family was broken up, you know, when I was like 16

13:31.310 --> 13:33.220
or 17 years old.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.690
When you're getting ready to decide

13:34.690 --> 13:35.890
on what you want to do with your life.

13:35.890 --> 13:40.262
And then all of a sudden, you know, my family split up.

13:40.262 --> 13:42.530
âª Now, in my corner âª

13:42.530 --> 13:45.817
âª I got their stealing in my eyes âª

13:45.817 --> 13:48.090
âª And arms holding up my knees âª

13:48.090 --> 13:51.288
âª And, man, rocking back and forth's my life âª

13:51.288 --> 13:53.477
âª I didn't mean to feel this way âª

13:53.477 --> 13:56.287
âª When I walked into the door âª

13:56.287 --> 13:58.786
âª You then ripped away my memories âª

13:58.786 --> 14:00.991
âª And I can't remember âª

14:00.991 --> 14:03.857
âª Who I was before âª

14:03.857 --> 14:07.650
And when I left home, I left on cracked ice.

14:07.650 --> 14:08.640
I didn't care about life.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.190
I didn't care about my family.

14:10.190 --> 14:12.510
When I moved out to Los Angeles, I realized

14:12.510 --> 14:13.810
that a lot of things that I didn't care

14:13.810 --> 14:15.720
about were a lot of things that I needed to

14:15.720 --> 14:19.353
at least make me want to, you know, make it through the day.

14:19.353 --> 14:24.353
âª I only wanted to be 16 âª

14:26.394 --> 14:28.644
âª And free âª

14:32.510 --> 14:34.595
I like Shannon because he knows Axl.

14:34.595 --> 14:35.933
(laughing)

14:35.933 --> 14:37.350
Shut up!

14:37.350 --> 14:38.260
All right, here you go.

14:38.260 --> 14:39.500
This is the Record Plant.

14:39.500 --> 14:43.788
This is where me and Axl been working on vocals together.

14:43.788 --> 14:45.610
(woops)

14:45.610 --> 14:46.870
How'd you get hooked up with

14:46.870 --> 14:47.890
Guns N' Roses?

14:47.890 --> 14:49.620
He was a friend of my sister's

14:49.620 --> 14:50.980
and there's like a little tribe

14:50.980 --> 14:54.724
of people out in California from Lafayette, Indiana.

14:54.724 --> 14:55.960
I've been running around with Slash, mom.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.880
That's why I haven't been in jail.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.070
All right, Ax.

14:59.070 --> 15:00.360
You're talking to Nel Hoon,

15:00.360 --> 15:03.320
the Nel Hoon that I popped out of.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.880
Yo, Merry Christmas.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.730
I been good, haven't I, Ax?

15:06.730 --> 15:08.100
Well... (chuckles)

15:08.100 --> 15:11.540
Anyway, mother, seeing as your son has no money,

15:11.540 --> 15:12.680
no money...

15:14.800 --> 15:15.993
Hold on a second.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.250
(sighs)

15:18.250 --> 15:20.173
This was all I could give you.

15:23.891 --> 15:25.123
I love you, mom.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.150
It's Shannon!

15:27.150 --> 15:28.150
Shannon Hoon?

15:28.150 --> 15:30.240
It's Shannon Hoon, the singer for Blind Melon,

15:30.240 --> 15:32.270
the guy from the Guns N' Roses video.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.540
Hey, weren't you that guy

15:33.540 --> 15:34.934
from the Guns N' Roses video?

15:34.934 --> 15:35.950
Yeah!

15:35.950 --> 15:36.783
That's you, man?

15:36.783 --> 15:38.142
Yeah!

15:41.130 --> 15:42.200
Speaking of your whole deal

15:42.200 --> 15:43.280
with Guns N' Roses,

15:43.280 --> 15:44.113
Yeah?

15:44.113 --> 15:44.990
And "Don't Cry,"

15:44.990 --> 15:46.720
It's something that's completely separate

15:46.720 --> 15:48.250
from Blind Melon.

15:48.250 --> 15:49.625
Our music and Guns N' Roses' music

15:49.625 --> 15:51.895
is completely different.

15:51.895 --> 15:56.567
âª Holyman, you don't understand âª

15:56.567 --> 15:58.610
So, I mean, apparently, you recorded a demo,

15:58.610 --> 16:01.260
and it was almost immediately kind of, you know,

16:01.260 --> 16:02.800
people started piling on.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.750
What was that like?

16:05.225 --> 16:09.180
One of our tapes got into a lawyer's hand and he called

16:09.180 --> 16:12.023
us and wanted to legally represent us and

16:12.023 --> 16:16.270
when we, you know, we were like "There's not much to

16:16.270 --> 16:17.470
legally represent here."

16:19.490 --> 16:22.370
We barely got enough

16:22.370 --> 16:24.661
songs to even get through a showcase.

16:24.661 --> 16:27.078
(vocalizing)

16:28.190 --> 16:29.280
He's the singer.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.660
We had only written, like, what?

16:30.660 --> 16:33.826
Five songs? Is that about all we had?

16:33.826 --> 16:34.659
Yeah.

16:34.659 --> 16:36.420
So to get a deal, we were just

16:36.420 --> 16:37.283
blown away.

16:41.023 --> 16:42.750
I don't know where the good karma came from

16:42.750 --> 16:43.583
because...

16:46.030 --> 16:48.993
March 18th, we signed with the tower tribe.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.997
The beginning of the rest of their lives.

16:52.997 --> 16:55.220
It's raining out today, beautiful day

16:55.220 --> 16:57.100
in Holly-weird, California.

16:57.100 --> 16:57.933
Right up there's the sign, Jack.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.306
Get the sign, get the sign.

16:59.306 --> 17:01.007
What sign?

17:01.007 --> 17:02.007
This sign.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.306
(chattering)

17:08.293 --> 17:09.880
(champagne pops)

17:09.880 --> 17:11.630
Come on, God!

17:18.097 --> 17:19.189
What's going on over here?

17:19.189 --> 17:21.745
Brad, did you look through it?

17:21.745 --> 17:22.915
Signing it already?

17:22.915 --> 17:24.093
Yeah.

17:24.093 --> 17:25.093
This is it.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.960
Signing it all away!

17:28.960 --> 17:33.135
What a happy guy, look at him. Oh, God, he's so happy.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.552
(chattering)

17:39.960 --> 17:41.717
No more drinking for Shannon Hoon.

17:41.717 --> 17:43.300
I know! I mean...

17:49.035 --> 17:51.702
(pipe crackles)

17:53.805 --> 17:54.830
You don't do any substances?

17:54.830 --> 17:58.010
You do marijuana, like, constantly.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.810
Are you asking me or telling me?

17:59.810 --> 18:01.360
Okay, I'm asking you.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.013
You don't have to say this, we can...

18:05.013 --> 18:06.640
Well I mean, you know...

18:06.640 --> 18:07.923
Press pause.

18:07.923 --> 18:08.756
I mean, there's...

18:08.756 --> 18:10.220
Some people do some things and some people

18:10.220 --> 18:12.551
do other things. Having control of what you do

18:12.551 --> 18:14.563
is the question, you know?
Yeah, definitely.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.800
I quit drinking alcohol, like, about a year ago.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.823
It was bad for me.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.113
Yeah.

18:22.113 --> 18:23.790
There's certain things for certain people.

18:23.790 --> 18:26.490
And alcohol was something that I couldn't deal with.

18:26.490 --> 18:28.490
And neither could anybody around me

18:28.490 --> 18:32.160
and neither should they have to deal with it.

18:34.186 --> 18:35.723
You better take care of him.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.781
Believe me, we try.

18:37.781 --> 18:40.680
It's hard to, though, when you're drinking.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.890
But none of us are as bad as he is, drinking-wise, so...

18:47.614 --> 18:49.414
We don't turn into Mr. Hyde.

18:50.870 --> 18:52.232
Except on occasion.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.353
So he has a dual personality?

18:54.353 --> 18:55.430
It's my...

18:56.400 --> 18:58.593
My rage tends to come out.

19:08.793 --> 19:09.670
Feel any better?

19:09.670 --> 19:11.240
Or different?

19:11.240 --> 19:14.380
I don't have to call and apologize

19:14.380 --> 19:16.218
for the night before so often now.

19:16.218 --> 19:17.450
(laughing)

19:17.450 --> 19:18.283
So...

19:18.283 --> 19:20.550
It kind of makes it a little better.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.634
I think of how much happier my life

19:22.634 --> 19:24.280
could have possibly been.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.180
If I would've known what was going on.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.153
Yeah.

19:28.153 --> 19:30.021
I don't want to sit here and waste my time.

19:30.021 --> 19:32.621
The same way that you don't want to waste your time.

19:49.490 --> 19:50.640
What is the date today?

19:54.004 --> 19:55.212
(laughing)

19:55.212 --> 19:56.629
What?

19:58.589 --> 19:59.422
What is this, Shannon?

19:59.422 --> 20:00.697
This is two years later now?

20:01.735 --> 20:03.290
Yeah.

20:03.290 --> 20:06.457
(music playing on TV)

20:07.772 --> 20:10.900
You get your whole fucking life on video now.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.113
Nobody else, you know,

20:13.113 --> 20:15.280
before us could do that.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.820
Yeah. Well...

20:17.820 --> 20:20.123
Like now, here we are filming our life.

20:24.418 --> 20:27.168
(tape rewinding)

20:37.240 --> 20:39.190
Shannon Hoon.

20:39.190 --> 20:42.140
Live here in beautiful Seattle, Washington.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.490
We're going to find out exactly how the progress

20:44.490 --> 20:48.960
and everything like that with their album number one.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.643
Their first little creation.

20:51.721 --> 20:54.138
(rock music)

21:05.855 --> 21:09.280
(ping pong ball hitting paddles)

21:09.280 --> 21:12.420
(ping pong ball clatters)

21:12.420 --> 21:14.380
So I guess you would be considered the loser

21:14.380 --> 21:15.290
at this point, Shannon.

21:15.290 --> 21:16.123
Well, consider that you fucking-

21:16.123 --> 21:17.460
So you're the loser.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.110
Can you hear me?

21:23.110 --> 21:25.613
Do you, you need to get a mix and all that shit?

21:29.190 --> 21:31.440
(snapping)

21:34.600 --> 21:38.017
(quiet guitar strumming)

21:47.377 --> 21:52.377
âª All I can say is that my life is pretty plain âª

21:53.628 --> 21:58.628
âª I like watching the puddles gather rain âª

22:00.220 --> 22:02.759
âª And all that I can do âª

22:02.759 --> 22:06.129
âª Is just pour some tea for two âª

22:06.129 --> 22:08.783
âª And speak my point of view âª

22:08.783 --> 22:12.059
âª But it's not sane âª

22:12.059 --> 22:14.726
âª It's not sane âª

22:18.688 --> 22:20.690
Did you get it, Rick?

22:20.690 --> 22:22.911
Hi, I'm the cameraman, I'm the one that's not

22:22.911 --> 22:24.020
getting videoed that much

22:24.020 --> 22:26.460
because I'm making sure that everybody else has

22:26.460 --> 22:28.453
priceless video footage for the future.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.805
We're in New York.

22:32.805 --> 22:35.213
I shaved my eyebrows off.

22:35.213 --> 22:37.010
I'll zoom you in here, hope you can see.

22:37.010 --> 22:39.430
If you can't, don't worry about it.

22:39.430 --> 22:40.820
I'll show you later.

22:40.820 --> 22:42.620
But, we're in New York,

22:42.620 --> 22:47.043
it's the 22nd of April, 1992.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.000
Getting ready to go out to eat.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.760
I haven't taken you to New York yet.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.700
And I'm sorry I've been abusing you visually,

22:54.700 --> 22:58.363
but that's just the way it goes when I own the camera.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.430
I own the camera.

23:00.430 --> 23:03.030
So you are the watcher.

23:03.030 --> 23:04.483
So shut up and watch.

23:11.065 --> 23:12.194
There's the World Trade Center,

23:12.194 --> 23:13.930
looming in the distance.

23:13.930 --> 23:15.347
How many floors?

23:16.700 --> 23:19.163
112, or something like that.

23:19.163 --> 23:21.013
It's one of the seven modern wonders.

23:22.890 --> 23:24.393
Trump Plaza, ew...

23:25.682 --> 23:26.515
Don.

23:31.713 --> 23:34.387
What inspires you most lyrically

23:34.387 --> 23:37.054
in the process of writing songs?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.010
A lot of, a lot of different things.

23:43.010 --> 23:43.843
You know?

23:43.843 --> 23:45.460
I mean, the way it phone's sitting on a counter

23:45.460 --> 23:46.870
might inspire me.

23:46.870 --> 23:48.670
I mean, I can't, I don't know.

23:48.670 --> 23:49.670
I can't...

23:51.040 --> 23:54.520
To hear the story of someone who's been dealt

23:54.520 --> 23:56.267
a bad hand, you know,

23:57.857 --> 24:01.713
just to be sane and insane inspires me.

24:06.790 --> 24:08.230
Well, actually...

24:10.470 --> 24:11.387
He now speaks--

24:12.738 --> 24:14.862
We're at the St. Moritz hotel,

24:14.862 --> 24:17.480
across from Central Park in New York City

24:17.480 --> 24:20.917
where I've just broken my first hotel mirror.

24:21.990 --> 24:24.823
(continuous beep)

24:34.531 --> 24:35.638
(unintelligible) and the fire's burning-

24:35.638 --> 24:39.479
Holy shit. Holy shit!

24:39.479 --> 24:42.600
Over the decision a jury reached hours ago

24:42.600 --> 24:45.160
There are riots all over L.A..

24:45.160 --> 24:47.065
Police are shown in this video tape

24:47.065 --> 24:50.980
beating a black motorist, are not guilty of any crimes.

24:50.980 --> 24:52.750
The verdict was shocking because of

24:52.750 --> 24:55.940
a central piece of evidence, an amateur photographer's

24:55.940 --> 24:59.530
videotape. The Los Angeles Police beating Rodney King

24:59.530 --> 25:00.735
in March of last year.

25:00.735 --> 25:02.103
This is how we're going to tell America

25:02.103 --> 25:04.510
that our generation is conservative.

25:04.510 --> 25:05.960
Our generation is Republican.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.900
I'd like to introduce a new band that I like a lot

25:10.900 --> 25:12.250
and they've got a different style

25:12.250 --> 25:13.083
and I think you're going to like them a lot.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.480
And you're definitely going to hear about them a lot.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.923
They're called Blind Melon.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.873
Oh goodness.

25:21.450 --> 25:23.020
Probably one of the most original album covers

25:23.020 --> 25:23.853
I've ever seen.

25:23.853 --> 25:26.030
It's Glen, our drummer's sister.

25:26.030 --> 25:29.540
It was a family picture on the grand family wall.

25:32.373 --> 25:34.323
Getting ready to do a big tour, I hear.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.000
We're on our way to Missouri.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.486
It's my birthday.

25:38.486 --> 25:42.300
We're going to rock out with fucking Oz.

25:42.300 --> 25:45.636
And Alice in Chains. With Rog in the back seat.

25:45.636 --> 25:46.469
And...

25:49.630 --> 25:51.459
What, Lisa?

25:51.459 --> 25:52.824
How you doing? We're Blind Melon,

25:52.824 --> 25:53.657
we're the opening act.

25:53.657 --> 25:54.521
Go on in.

25:54.521 --> 25:56.343
Okay, thank you.

25:56.343 --> 25:58.630
Reach in like that.

25:58.630 --> 25:59.740
And then when you want to stop recording,

25:59.740 --> 26:01.790
you push fader again, and you'll see fader come

26:01.790 --> 26:03.397
up on the screen. See it?

26:03.397 --> 26:06.230
And then you push fader, fade out.

26:08.449 --> 26:10.866
(rock music)

26:30.094 --> 26:32.373
I see stars, man. I'm just like so pumped up.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.820
I just have tunnel vision.

26:33.820 --> 26:36.439
You know, like you're looking through a couple of straws

26:36.439 --> 26:39.310
and wear myself out to where I can't even breathe right.

26:39.310 --> 26:42.410
Just from my adrenaline racing through my body

26:42.410 --> 26:44.839
like a frigging freight train.

26:44.839 --> 26:47.672
(continuous tone)

26:51.630 --> 26:54.240
The best mind candy to thread the cutting edge.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.560
They may not hail from Seattle,

26:55.560 --> 26:57.627
but Blind Melon is destined to be one

26:57.627 --> 26:59.020
of the new Nirvana's.

26:59.020 --> 27:00.460
(laughing)

27:00.460 --> 27:04.400
I came here with grand delusions

27:04.400 --> 27:09.360
of backstage groupies and look where I am in the hotel.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.268
I've been eating chocolate chip cookies

27:11.268 --> 27:12.750
and then I ended up hanging out

27:12.750 --> 27:17.691
with Shannon once again in a hotel room, it was lame.

27:17.691 --> 27:20.351
(laughing)

27:20.351 --> 27:21.383
Goodnight, Rog.

27:21.383 --> 27:23.633
Goodnight, man.

27:31.550 --> 27:32.893
Christmas '92.

27:34.224 --> 27:36.474
(laughing)

27:37.716 --> 27:42.000
My dad is going, he's going to go to jail

27:42.000 --> 27:46.570
for DUIs tomorrow night. Are you there dad?

27:46.570 --> 27:47.692
And then they take your license?

27:47.692 --> 27:49.050
Yeah, then they take them.

27:49.050 --> 27:49.883
For how long?

27:49.883 --> 27:51.250
10 years.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.500
You don't need a driver's license

27:52.500 --> 27:54.086
to drive a golf cart, do you?

27:54.086 --> 27:56.930
(laughing) No. But I sure as hell

27:56.930 --> 27:58.683
can't drive a golf cart to work.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.085
Goddamn it.

28:01.085 --> 28:03.983
That'd be the talk of the town. It already is now.

28:05.489 --> 28:07.880
Everybody feels like it's safe to go out now.

28:07.880 --> 28:08.930
Yeah, mm-hmm.

28:10.911 --> 28:13.250
So you proposed to mom again last night.

28:13.250 --> 28:16.399
I did not! I just told her

28:16.399 --> 28:18.630
if she wanted to get married and have insurance,

28:18.630 --> 28:19.463
she'd have it.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.070
Well both of you are too goddamn crazy to find

28:23.070 --> 28:24.563
anybody else to love you.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.702
Do solemnly swear

28:30.702 --> 28:33.070
That I will faithfully execute the Office

28:33.070 --> 28:35.375
of President of the United States.

28:35.375 --> 28:38.027
That I will faithfully execute the Office

28:38.027 --> 28:40.183
of President of the United States.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.210
Mulholland Drive. This is where

28:50.210 --> 28:52.160
all the big stars live.

28:53.416 --> 28:54.963
Big stars.

28:54.963 --> 28:56.796
Big stars.

29:00.540 --> 29:03.260
Rogers, you're going to be out here on Sunday,

29:03.260 --> 29:05.105
and we had to binge before you got out here.

29:05.105 --> 29:08.628
'Cause I haven't binged in a long time.

29:08.628 --> 29:09.643
We were out for fucking...

29:09.643 --> 29:10.820
Too many days.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.337
You tell me that drugs aren't good sometimes.

29:26.087 --> 29:28.753
Broke my sobriety of 11 months.

29:30.874 --> 29:32.374
10 months, I mean.

29:40.694 --> 29:43.361
(clock ticking)

29:46.330 --> 29:47.580
In Lafayette.

29:48.640 --> 29:53.547
Been sent down, started drinking in L.A..

29:55.100 --> 29:55.983
Now I'm...

29:59.267 --> 30:00.986
getting my head clear.

30:00.986 --> 30:03.331
(clock ticking)

30:03.331 --> 30:06.164
(angelic singing)

30:34.610 --> 30:36.213
Been clear for a minute now.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.380
In the interview you did before

30:41.380 --> 30:43.086
you said something like, you know,

30:43.086 --> 30:45.071
you weren't really happy.

30:45.071 --> 30:47.830
Your childhood wasn't very happy.

30:47.830 --> 30:49.303
Your parents were divorced.

30:51.860 --> 30:53.400
I had a lot

30:53.400 --> 30:56.290
of problems with alcohol in my family that, you know,

30:56.290 --> 30:59.360
that ended up being a problem for me.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.980
And it's priceless success to me, worth more

31:02.980 --> 31:06.940
than any thing will ever mean to me, to be able to

31:07.880 --> 31:11.823
establish healthy relationships with members of my family.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.280
Well, I gotta go.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.113
All right.

31:17.113 --> 31:20.281
See you this afternoon. If it rains, I'll be home.

31:20.281 --> 31:22.770
I'll probably be asleep.

31:22.770 --> 31:24.330
I'll try to stay awake.

31:24.330 --> 31:27.520
I'm so annoyed right now, I can't fucking sleep.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.727
I'll see you later on, Pop.

31:28.727 --> 31:29.711
Okay, hon.

31:29.711 --> 31:30.989
Have a good one.

31:30.989 --> 31:31.822
You too.

31:34.415 --> 31:37.165
Ain't nothing good about working.

31:38.682 --> 31:39.886
Getting off.

31:39.886 --> 31:40.969
Yeah.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.780
What time is it?

31:58.887 --> 32:01.804
(guitar strumming)

32:02.856 --> 32:05.762
âª Now, as I open my eyes âª

32:05.762 --> 32:10.542
âª To start another day âª

32:10.542 --> 32:14.167
âª In a pile of puke, empty bag of excuses âª

32:14.167 --> 32:16.542
âª My love for friends and family âª

32:16.542 --> 32:18.323
âª So much I need them âª

32:18.323 --> 32:23.323
âª Under a sun that's seen it all before âª

32:24.833 --> 32:29.007
âª And my feet are so âª

32:29.007 --> 32:32.214
âª And I can't believe that I have âª

32:32.214 --> 32:36.955
âª To bang my head against the wall again âª

32:36.955 --> 32:39.072
âª Oh, well, the blows âª

32:39.072 --> 32:44.072
âª They have just a little more space between them âª

32:45.758 --> 32:50.250
âª I'm gonna take a breath and try âª

32:50.250 --> 32:53.500
âª And try again, again âª

33:05.613 --> 33:07.460
I mean, I know I'm not the only person

33:07.460 --> 33:08.410
who feels the way I feel.

33:08.410 --> 33:10.180
So it's just a matter of me

33:10.180 --> 33:13.583
being able to communicate with people through songs.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.788
Ah! The sun is out!

33:21.470 --> 33:26.470
Here comes the sun. (vocalizes)

33:30.664 --> 33:32.393
Yeah.

33:32.393 --> 33:35.632
I got playback, please.

33:35.632 --> 33:38.132
(music plays)

34:00.873 --> 34:02.990
Great video from Blind Melon.

34:02.990 --> 34:05.500
An unusual video for the hit track "No Rain"

34:05.500 --> 34:06.540
It's the feel good video of the 90's

34:07.840 --> 34:09.570
Yep, the song that's on everyone's lips

34:09.570 --> 34:11.930
is the very song that has zipped Blind Melon's album

34:11.930 --> 34:14.750
up Billboard's Top 200 chart to number seven.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.980
A pretty remarkable feat for an album that was released

34:16.980 --> 34:17.833
a year ago.

34:24.677 --> 34:27.344
(crowd singing)

34:51.860 --> 34:54.630
Things are getting really kind of crazy.

34:54.630 --> 34:57.030
We're going to put that in brainwash rotation!

35:11.021 --> 35:12.901
âª All I can say âª

35:12.901 --> 35:17.315
âª Is that my life is pretty plain âª

35:17.315 --> 35:20.065
(crowd cheering)

35:35.942 --> 35:38.025
Buenos Dias.

35:40.810 --> 35:42.510
Shannon, can we take a picture with you real quick?

35:42.510 --> 35:43.343
Yeah.

35:43.343 --> 35:45.041
Oh, cool, you're so cool. Okay.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.291
Thanks so much.

35:47.259 --> 35:48.560
Oh, my God, you're so cool.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.900
I'm so excited.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.255
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy.

35:53.255 --> 35:55.933
I'm just a regular guy, I swear to God.

35:55.933 --> 35:58.122
This is just the beginning.

35:58.122 --> 35:59.610
This track is going to last, you know

35:59.610 --> 36:01.563
hopefully two, three months long.

36:01.563 --> 36:03.880
Well, at some point when you guys get a little...

36:03.880 --> 36:06.530
get a little break, we're going to have to go in and

36:06.530 --> 36:07.840
try to lay down a few songs.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.769
'Cause I've been talking to some producer types.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.728
(laughing)

36:11.728 --> 36:12.561
You know what, Tim?

36:12.561 --> 36:13.394
I guess we'll have to try

36:13.394 --> 36:14.227
to write some more songs.

36:14.227 --> 36:15.060
I don't know if we can do it...

36:15.060 --> 36:18.493
Tim, in order to do those new songs, man, we need

36:18.493 --> 36:22.691
a new, another cash advance from capital.

36:22.691 --> 36:23.610
You do, huh?

36:23.610 --> 36:28.610
Yeah. Like non recoupable, $90,000 cash advance.

36:28.924 --> 36:30.470
(chuckling)

36:30.470 --> 36:31.750
Well, let me ask you this.

36:31.750 --> 36:32.820
See, I have this image.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.560
I have this image that I've got

36:35.560 --> 36:38.560
everybody perceiving me as, and it's really expensive,

36:38.560 --> 36:40.091
and I've run out of money.

36:40.091 --> 36:41.970
Yeah. It's hard to maintain that...

36:41.970 --> 36:44.976
that rockstar lifestyle, you have, isn't it?

36:44.976 --> 36:47.730
(laughing)

36:47.730 --> 36:48.770
You're going to be very busy

36:48.770 --> 36:49.690
over the next couple of months.

36:49.690 --> 36:52.436
Yeah, we just, we just got the Neil Young tour,

36:52.436 --> 36:54.440
Neil Young and Soundgarden.

36:54.440 --> 36:59.320
And that's definitely the rock and roll utopia tour for me.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.570
If we listen-

37:02.540 --> 37:03.760
Why that sounds like Neil Young

37:03.760 --> 37:05.343
playing my acoustic guitar.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.400
The value of that guitar is increasing exponentially

37:08.400 --> 37:09.799
right now.

37:09.799 --> 37:12.716
(guitar strumming)

37:28.191 --> 37:29.280
You know, when you have, like,

37:29.280 --> 37:30.230
one of those moments when

37:30.230 --> 37:33.870
you're watching someone play and everything is perfect

37:33.870 --> 37:35.530
to the point where you're so overwhelmed

37:35.530 --> 37:38.260
that you fucking, you just get all emotional

37:38.260 --> 37:39.860
and your eyes tear up and shit?

37:39.860 --> 37:40.693
Oh, yeah.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.030
Man, last night I was...

37:42.030 --> 37:44.276
Neil was getting ready to play "Helpless."

37:44.276 --> 37:46.177
Man, he- I mean...

37:46.177 --> 37:47.270
"There is a town,"

37:47.270 --> 37:49.637
right when he started, man, my eyes just went "whoop."

37:49.637 --> 37:52.403
Rolled right back in my head, man, I was fucking,

37:53.240 --> 37:54.073
I was tied.

37:55.017 --> 37:56.070
Fucking A.

37:56.070 --> 37:57.969
He was healing me.

37:57.969 --> 38:02.219
âª There is a town in North Ontario âª

38:05.312 --> 38:06.270
I mean, it's just...

38:06.270 --> 38:10.140
It feels good to know that that still exists.

38:10.140 --> 38:12.945
That people can still give those kind of feelings

38:12.945 --> 38:14.857
to other people, you know?

38:14.857 --> 38:16.810
And I'm sure your music

38:16.810 --> 38:19.210
does that to people too. And will do that.

38:19.210 --> 38:21.553
I mean, especially as you get old- get on.

38:22.470 --> 38:25.233
That song was written in, like, 1967, I think.

38:26.477 --> 38:27.993
That's pretty timeless.

38:27.993 --> 38:28.923
Think about that.

38:28.923 --> 38:33.900
Think about your record that was written in 1992...

38:33.900 --> 38:35.593
jacking some kid in 2010.

38:37.370 --> 38:39.020
That is pretty funny.

39:06.903 --> 39:07.797
To get you the good news before it happens,

39:07.797 --> 39:10.200
we are at 975 units.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.220
Therefore, the way sales have been,

39:12.220 --> 39:15.870
we should be Platinum by sometime tomorrow.

39:15.870 --> 39:19.090
It's been more like a waterfall now, I guess.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.471
Is it easy, now, to step back?

39:20.471 --> 39:21.740
Because when you are...

39:22.712 --> 39:25.954
That's why I've got a video camera

39:25.954 --> 39:27.760
There's so much happening now,

39:27.760 --> 39:31.100
I can't really sit back and soak it all in right now.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.453
So I'll just have to watch it and do it later.

39:38.282 --> 39:39.115
The sun was setting, we made it up here.

39:41.710 --> 39:44.937
Little pieces of time that I'll never have back.

39:46.460 --> 39:48.454
On that balcony part

39:48.454 --> 39:49.287
Don't!

39:50.320 --> 39:52.204
Don't be a stinker pot.

39:52.204 --> 39:53.037
Don't.

39:54.139 --> 39:55.434
No.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.017
Right on your face.

40:07.815 --> 40:09.850
Ooh, shh. We can't tell that.

40:09.850 --> 40:12.430
We'll tell it, you gotta protect your future.

40:12.430 --> 40:13.263
God damn-

40:13.263 --> 40:15.620
It's just, these things are just the best, man.

40:15.620 --> 40:16.640
I can put in a tape.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.273
You have no idea what's on it.

40:18.273 --> 40:21.875
You know, because it's just a collage of many things.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.208
Holy macaroni.

40:24.153 --> 40:25.236
Unbelievable.

40:26.460 --> 40:27.708
It pulls you back.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.541
Right into the moment.

40:32.675 --> 40:34.053
So, Shannon, what are you doing?

40:34.053 --> 40:35.484
I'm getting ready to deliver a pizza

40:35.484 --> 40:38.067
in front of 50,000 people nude.

40:39.803 --> 40:41.636
He's doing it.

40:49.061 --> 40:50.478
A crystal ball.

40:54.269 --> 40:56.650
I wish my girlfriend looked like that right now.

40:56.650 --> 40:58.720
I might even just call it Shannon, you know.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.125
I'm not just saying that.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.547
Totally wonderful.

41:05.770 --> 41:08.800
Mr. Jagger and Mr. Watts would like to meet the band

41:08.800 --> 41:13.070
if we're not busy, and they just so happened to

41:13.070 --> 41:16.143
catch us at a time when we really weren't that busy.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.783
It's my birthday, Glen.

41:23.073 --> 41:25.880
Have to take everybody for an actual walk over here

41:25.880 --> 41:30.410
across the Abbey Road crosswalk, so...

41:30.410 --> 41:31.243
here we are.

41:32.192 --> 41:33.963
See if you can feel the aura.

41:40.089 --> 41:42.089
(sighs)

41:43.480 --> 41:45.140
They were going this way?

41:45.140 --> 41:46.617
Oh, I went the wrong way.

41:50.195 --> 41:53.112
(guitar strumming)

41:56.535 --> 41:59.368
(harmonica plays)

42:08.507 --> 42:11.260
Do you want me to record, even in between songs?

42:11.260 --> 42:12.093
Yeah.

42:12.093 --> 42:13.707
Okay.

42:13.707 --> 42:14.770
So what shows should Lisa

42:14.770 --> 42:16.935
videotape the whole songs on?

42:16.935 --> 42:19.169
I don't know.

42:19.169 --> 42:20.780
It's fading in, and now do you turn the

42:20.780 --> 42:21.710
fader off?

42:21.710 --> 42:23.500
Now as the LE STB wide, turns to-

42:23.500 --> 42:24.370
To record.

42:24.370 --> 42:25.540
To record, okay.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.340
Now the fader automatically goes off.

42:27.340 --> 42:28.640
Okay.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.473
Fader.

42:30.510 --> 42:31.343
Fade.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.100
Why isn't it fading out?

42:34.100 --> 42:35.800
Because you can't- it's stuck.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.787
Oh, I do have to go here?

42:37.787 --> 42:40.976
No, you keep- you're just pushing the--

42:40.976 --> 42:43.120
On the count of three I want everybody to throw

42:43.120 --> 42:46.944
whatever it is they're going to throw up here, all right?

42:46.944 --> 42:48.523
So, I want to see all kinds of shoes

42:48.523 --> 42:51.614
flying from all your stinky fucking feet, all right?

42:51.614 --> 42:53.991
On the count of three, everybody now take them off.

42:53.991 --> 42:55.686
No cheating, no cheating.

42:55.686 --> 42:56.519
Ready?

42:56.519 --> 42:58.631
Is everybody ready?

42:58.631 --> 42:59.964
One, two, three.

43:01.526 --> 43:04.109
(crowd cheers)

43:12.824 --> 43:16.491
This is a song called "Holyman."

43:21.664 --> 43:24.497
Can you believe I did it?

43:25.909 --> 43:30.909
When you watch this back, I don't know.

43:30.967 --> 43:31.800
Give me the video.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.355
Give it to me, Shannon.

43:33.355 --> 43:35.005
If you're going to make fun of it

43:38.330 --> 43:40.740
put it away right now.

43:40.740 --> 43:42.703
Seriously. I'm serious.

43:50.384 --> 43:51.840
Ouch.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.673
Ouch?

43:52.673 --> 43:54.180
Did you hear my bones breaking?

43:54.180 --> 43:56.392
That was me, dummy.

43:56.392 --> 43:58.793
You're not filming anything, Shannon.

43:59.690 --> 44:00.640
The light's not on.

44:21.376 --> 44:24.376
What am I going to do today?

44:36.248 --> 44:37.522
Hey Shannon, it's Chris.

44:37.522 --> 44:38.599
I just wanted to

44:38.599 --> 44:39.943
let you know that

44:39.943 --> 44:43.250
90-- 95% that we're going to get a cover now.

44:43.250 --> 44:44.190
So it looks really good.

44:44.190 --> 44:46.763
They also need to do a session with just you.

44:47.690 --> 44:48.523
Which we will talk about that.

44:48.523 --> 44:50.481
So give me a call when you get in.

44:50.481 --> 44:51.898
See you man, bye.

44:54.469 --> 44:57.886
(indistinct chattering)

45:02.825 --> 45:04.020
Boy, I'm really disappointed.

45:04.020 --> 45:05.669
I'm sorry. I was fucking really excited about

45:05.669 --> 45:07.730
being on the cover of Rolling Stone

45:07.730 --> 45:08.920
How do they want just Shannon?

45:08.920 --> 45:09.790
I don't know.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.520
They've wanted it for a while.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.052
So is Shannon going to do it?

45:14.052 --> 45:15.060
Yes.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.096
I think he will.

45:16.096 --> 45:16.929
Yeah.

45:16.929 --> 45:17.770
I think it's totally wrong

45:17.770 --> 45:18.603
for the perception of the band.

45:18.603 --> 45:20.800
Shannon's not going to refuse to do it?

45:20.800 --> 45:22.398
I don't know, I think he should though.

45:22.398 --> 45:24.371
He's saying "Well, I'm doing what's best for the band."

45:24.371 --> 45:25.910
'Cause they're going to cut the article, right,

45:25.910 --> 45:27.268
If we're not on the cover.

45:27.268 --> 45:28.440
[Rogers] I think it's a load of crap

45:28.440 --> 45:30.956
because Soul Asylum was all the whole band,

45:30.956 --> 45:31.789
I mean, Spin Doctors--

45:31.789 --> 45:32.940
[Brad] They're saying there's been

45:32.940 --> 45:34.390
too many bands on the cover.

45:34.390 --> 45:35.223
Well, we're a band.

45:35.223 --> 45:37.368
They need to get somebody else to do a cover story on.

45:37.368 --> 45:38.535
Yeah.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.523
Today was the day.

45:55.610 --> 45:59.410
Today was the day, early this morning where Shannon finally

45:59.410 --> 46:02.240
realized that he was the driving force behind the band

46:02.240 --> 46:03.950
and was going to be on the cover of Rolling Stone

46:03.950 --> 46:05.173
because he deserved it.

46:06.208 --> 46:10.454
Then after discussing it with the end of Brad's bass,

46:10.454 --> 46:13.470
Brad decided that that was no longer the case,

46:13.470 --> 46:14.720
all for one, one for all.

46:16.930 --> 46:19.600
Shannon finally decided that

46:21.620 --> 46:25.700
the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.730
Today was the day that Shannon Hoon finally realized

46:28.730 --> 46:30.540
that the four of us are always right.

46:30.540 --> 46:31.643
And he's always wrong.

46:32.935 --> 46:34.530
It's as simple as that.

46:34.530 --> 46:35.954
I've got to hear what this guy's got to say.

46:35.954 --> 46:36.930
Brad, don't be fucking throwing your bass

46:36.930 --> 46:38.080
at that camera there, boy.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.473
Yeah...

46:39.473 --> 46:41.140
(chuckles)

46:41.140 --> 46:45.493
No, what sucks is I hit my fucking Ampeg.

46:47.340 --> 46:48.800
He did more than hit his Ampeg.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.501
I just went out and looked at his Ampeg.

46:51.501 --> 46:53.301
Now who caused all this?

46:54.640 --> 46:56.750
Rolling Stone Magazine caused all this.

46:56.750 --> 46:57.650
Because they just see the band

46:57.650 --> 47:01.270
as commodities and products and marketing.

47:01.270 --> 47:02.880
They don't realize there's real human beings

47:02.880 --> 47:04.683
with real feelings involved.

47:09.350 --> 47:10.610
I'm nervous.

47:10.610 --> 47:11.523
Are you Rodgers?

47:17.716 --> 47:19.966
(laughing)

47:29.634 --> 47:31.559
Oh, no!

47:31.559 --> 47:33.017
Shannon's got a roll.

47:33.017 --> 47:34.150
(laughing)

47:34.150 --> 47:36.483
I'd been doing my drinking.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.433
Kept it at the maximum.

47:42.398 --> 47:46.867
âª Rolling Stones âª

47:46.867 --> 47:48.437
âª Stone âª

47:48.437 --> 47:50.631
âª Five copies for my mother âª

47:50.631 --> 47:52.381
500. 500.

47:53.876 --> 47:58.043
âª On the cover of a Rolling Stone âª

48:00.223 --> 48:02.473
(laughing)

48:04.609 --> 48:07.158
Are you filming him?

48:07.158 --> 48:08.402
Is that thing on?

48:08.402 --> 48:09.235
Mm-hmm.

48:09.235 --> 48:10.700
I thought you said it was fucked up.

48:10.700 --> 48:12.063
Well, I'm trying to play--

48:12.063 --> 48:13.200
I feel like I'm at camp.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.230
I just got a weird flashback of a thing at camp.

48:16.230 --> 48:17.780
Well, I'm pissed because

48:17.780 --> 48:19.510
I'm playing some tapes back

48:20.670 --> 48:22.060
from a long, long time ago.

48:22.060 --> 48:24.000
And, like, while they're in play mode

48:24.000 --> 48:26.893
and I'm watching, watching them back through here,

48:27.940 --> 48:30.957
the screen just starts breaking up and starts--

48:45.500 --> 48:48.167
(pee splashing)

49:07.360 --> 49:09.451
Wait, hold on a second.

49:09.451 --> 49:11.213
I'll get it. I'm going to get it.

49:11.213 --> 49:12.847
Can I have one of those earrings?

49:12.847 --> 49:15.012
Man, everything's-

49:15.012 --> 49:16.391
Can I have your necklace?

49:16.391 --> 49:17.531
No way.

49:17.531 --> 49:19.098
My mom gave me that.

49:19.098 --> 49:20.837
Melon head till I'm dead.

49:20.837 --> 49:22.257
Damn.

49:22.257 --> 49:23.273
That's commitment.

49:24.657 --> 49:27.588
I saw you on TV.

49:27.588 --> 49:29.380
(in Spanish) Hello! We are Blind Melon,

49:29.380 --> 49:32.177
and this is our video, "No Rain."

49:33.060 --> 49:33.893
She's in Milwaukee.

49:33.893 --> 49:34.726
You know what?

49:34.726 --> 49:35.563
People like you need to get out of here.

49:35.563 --> 49:36.960
You're a fucking smart ass.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.303
I'm fucking security (unintelligible)

49:38.303 --> 49:41.386
(indistinct arguing)

49:43.989 --> 49:45.480
You ain't going to do nothing to me, man.

49:45.480 --> 49:47.340
You're not gonna do one thing to me.

49:47.340 --> 49:48.403
Not one thing.

49:49.580 --> 49:53.113
Not one thing. Not one thing you fucking--

49:53.113 --> 49:57.101
So, I'm sitting here, in the courtroom.

49:57.101 --> 50:00.101
I'm not sure what's going to happen.

50:02.410 --> 50:05.420
No rain is probably one of the best self-esteem videos

50:05.420 --> 50:06.310
I've ever seen.

50:06.310 --> 50:08.520
And I think that's why a lot of people really love it is

50:08.520 --> 50:10.470
because this little girl who was just doing her stuff

50:10.470 --> 50:13.870
and thought she was so much in her glory and her pride

50:13.870 --> 50:17.200
of just being herself was laughed at until that moment

50:17.200 --> 50:18.033
of revelation.

50:18.033 --> 50:19.467
When she looks through the gates and she goes,

50:19.467 --> 50:21.690
"Man there's people just like me."

50:21.690 --> 50:22.523
It's cute.

50:22.523 --> 50:23.470
It is cute.

50:23.470 --> 50:24.380
I hate cute.

50:25.338 --> 50:26.400
Cute is killing you.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.233
I can tell.

50:27.233 --> 50:28.154
I don't really...

50:28.154 --> 50:29.486
A bee!

50:29.486 --> 50:30.899
Cheryl!

50:30.899 --> 50:32.060
A bee.

50:32.060 --> 50:32.893
Oh, no.

50:32.893 --> 50:33.726
Boy.

50:33.726 --> 50:34.684
The bee.

50:34.684 --> 50:36.465
Bigger than the band.

50:36.465 --> 50:37.957
Ladies and gentlemen.

50:37.957 --> 50:39.757
Blind Melon.

50:39.757 --> 50:41.300
(crowd cheering)

50:41.300 --> 50:44.133
(slow rock music)

50:56.148 --> 50:59.608
âª All I can say âª

50:59.608 --> 51:03.691
âª Is my life, it's pretty lame. âª

51:04.753 --> 51:07.900
I think people are analyzing it way too deep.

51:07.900 --> 51:08.733
You know what I mean?

51:08.733 --> 51:11.803
That's the problem with, with a lot of things, you know

51:11.803 --> 51:14.400
is that like day to day, I'm asked to

51:14.400 --> 51:16.668
analyze how I got to where I'm at and you know,

51:16.668 --> 51:20.220
not really paying attention to it is the beauty of it,

51:20.220 --> 51:21.800
you know? And then all of a sudden you're asked to

51:21.800 --> 51:24.240
analyze it, (unintelligible)

51:24.240 --> 51:25.670
So, you know, I mean, I don't want to figure

51:25.670 --> 51:27.534
out how I got to where I'm at.

51:27.534 --> 51:30.701
(marching band plays)

51:36.840 --> 51:38.340
As quickly as it might have come,

51:38.340 --> 51:40.923
it can be gone that soon.

51:45.950 --> 51:47.660
This is just a timeframe we're dealing with.

51:47.660 --> 51:50.263
We're not going to be here for forever.

51:58.380 --> 52:01.027
I like writing music and I like doing things like this,

52:01.027 --> 52:03.040
but at the same time, it's like

52:03.940 --> 52:06.430
there's other things that I have just as

52:06.430 --> 52:09.033
much enthusiasm doing.

52:25.220 --> 52:27.408
What do you want to do?

52:27.408 --> 52:29.208
I want to get into film.

52:38.046 --> 52:39.120
It's just that all this,

52:39.120 --> 52:40.800
everything is so serious now.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.520
It takes up too much time.

52:52.977 --> 52:55.720
A year in legal violations began in January

52:55.720 --> 52:57.590
with the arrest of Ted Nugent

52:57.590 --> 52:59.730
who violated Cincinnati's fire code

52:59.730 --> 53:02.410
by shooting a lit arrow onstage.

53:02.410 --> 53:05.600
David Lee Roth was arrested for possession of marijuana.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.410
Shannon Hoon was caught with his pants down

53:07.410 --> 53:09.320
and charged with indecent exposure

53:09.320 --> 53:12.170
for urinating onstage during a Vancouver concert.

53:12.170 --> 53:13.941
We wanted important things for people

53:13.941 --> 53:15.358
to get mad about.

53:16.544 --> 53:17.377
I don't know.

53:17.377 --> 53:18.600
What do you want to do?

53:18.600 --> 53:20.600
I'll take whatever someone doesn't want.

53:22.660 --> 53:23.493
How's that?

53:24.388 --> 53:26.170
I've got to fucking wait here.

53:26.170 --> 53:28.095
I scored some smack.

53:28.095 --> 53:30.595
I ended up getting some smack.

53:33.490 --> 53:37.510
Doing the pee thing, you know, tells...

53:43.450 --> 53:44.650
That's what we're doing.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.530
That's what we're doing.

53:50.707 --> 53:53.330
Tuesday 9:43 PM.

53:53.330 --> 53:55.310
Shannon, this is Lisa, again.

53:55.310 --> 53:57.030
This is third time I've called you

53:57.030 --> 53:58.373
wondering where you're at.

53:59.307 --> 54:00.140
I don't know.

54:00.140 --> 54:01.570
Just trying to get ahold of you.

54:01.570 --> 54:02.430
Didn't get to talk to you

54:02.430 --> 54:04.780
for the last couple of days at all, really.

54:04.780 --> 54:08.150
If you're around, you can call me later tonight.

54:08.150 --> 54:09.860
End of message.

54:09.860 --> 54:11.563
Hello, this is Chris Jones.

54:11.563 --> 54:12.460
Just thought I'd call and

54:12.460 --> 54:13.970
see if you were still alive today.

54:13.970 --> 54:16.710
We're up to a 1.1 million records sold.

54:16.710 --> 54:18.240
So, I just thought I'd give you a little bit of

54:18.240 --> 54:20.240
business news so you can feel great today.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.720
That's it, brother.

54:21.720 --> 54:24.910
Shannon, it's your mom just calling to say hi.

54:24.910 --> 54:26.163
Talk to you later. Bye.

54:27.476 --> 54:29.263
Been trying all day to get you.

54:29.263 --> 54:32.475
This is about the millionth time I've called.

54:32.475 --> 54:34.616
Don't know where you could be.

54:34.616 --> 54:35.740
I'm not going to call you anymore.

54:35.740 --> 54:39.310
You can call me. You know. Bye.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.977
Message discarded.

54:51.247 --> 54:52.963
Been a very lazy boy.

54:54.200 --> 54:55.887
I didn't tape anything in L.A.,

54:57.030 --> 55:00.490
nothing on the Christmas show with

55:02.040 --> 55:07.000
Porno for Pyros, Smashing Pumpkin tests, Cranberries,

55:07.000 --> 55:11.820
Cracker, Henry Rollins read "The Night Before Christmas,"

55:11.820 --> 55:14.070
which was the highlight of the whole evening.

55:17.010 --> 55:17.843
That's all.

55:19.940 --> 55:21.690
I can only tell you about it because

55:21.690 --> 55:24.090
I didn't videotape any of it.

55:24.090 --> 55:24.923
Sorry.

55:27.556 --> 55:30.223
(train rolling)

55:50.353 --> 55:53.020
(child singing)

55:58.009 --> 56:01.081
âª Frosty, the snowman âª

56:01.081 --> 56:04.414
âª Was a very, very soul âª

56:07.273 --> 56:11.190
Hi, look at you. You look adorable.

56:13.774 --> 56:17.024
Are you taking a picture for me, too?

56:17.881 --> 56:18.799
Hurry!

56:18.799 --> 56:19.976
Oh, the train?

56:19.976 --> 56:20.809
No.

56:21.929 --> 56:24.428
Where are you going?

56:24.428 --> 56:26.345
Hurry, Uncle Shannon!

56:27.971 --> 56:29.260
Alrighty.

56:29.260 --> 56:30.440
No, this way!

56:30.440 --> 56:32.589
What's down there?

56:32.589 --> 56:37.303
There's a ugly beast who will eat you up.

56:37.303 --> 56:38.920
There's a big ugly beast,

56:38.920 --> 56:39.873
gonna eat me up?

56:41.015 --> 56:43.705
Uh oh, we've got to be quiet.

56:43.705 --> 56:45.527
Shh...

56:45.527 --> 56:47.777
Make sure the big ugly beast doesn't hear us.

56:49.794 --> 56:54.794
âª Fade away âª

56:54.806 --> 56:57.279
âª Oh, you know, I never thought âª

56:57.279 --> 57:02.279
âª I'd lay in the shade âª

57:02.547 --> 57:06.898
âª I was much too clever âª

57:06.898 --> 57:11.898
âª But one of these days I'll sever you some truth âª

57:15.429 --> 57:17.980
âª Yeah âª

57:17.980 --> 57:21.480
âª And then I'll sever you âª

57:22.992 --> 57:25.325
(vocalizes)

57:30.688 --> 57:33.180
It's New Year's Eve.

57:33.180 --> 57:35.430
Happy New Year's everybody.

57:40.912 --> 57:41.745
Woo-wee!

57:44.584 --> 57:45.417
Woo-wee!

57:51.774 --> 57:55.274
What are you looking at out there, Crouse?

57:56.295 --> 57:57.910
Okay, so, right now in Japan

57:57.910 --> 58:00.120
people are paying attention to the kind of music

58:00.120 --> 58:05.120
by Pearl Jam, and of course by yours and Nirvana,

58:05.280 --> 58:08.100
or, you know, what we call alternative sound.

58:08.100 --> 58:11.273
What do you think about their music?

58:12.573 --> 58:13.447
I think that bands like Nirvana

58:13.447 --> 58:18.050
and Pearl Jam have really helped a lot of people

58:18.050 --> 58:19.623
deal with whatever it is

58:19.623 --> 58:21.743
that a young person deals with today.

58:24.340 --> 58:26.340
Music is a very therapeutic thing.

58:26.340 --> 58:27.900
That's what I'm attracted to.

58:27.900 --> 58:30.750
People get therapeutic value from listening to it.

58:30.750 --> 58:33.290
Some people get it from playing it, it's a fix,

58:33.290 --> 58:35.300
and it helps get a lot of things out of you

58:35.300 --> 58:36.383
and helps you bleed.

58:43.030 --> 58:46.540
We wish you good health and

58:47.500 --> 58:50.290
more happiness and even more big success

58:50.290 --> 58:51.793
for many years to come

58:51.793 --> 58:53.126
for Blind Melon.

58:58.808 --> 58:59.940
And final question.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.660
I've noticed that...

59:01.660 --> 59:04.552
religion has been a heavy theme in your music.

59:04.552 --> 59:08.930
Songs like "Soak the Sin," and "Holyman," "Change,"

59:08.930 --> 59:11.980
Is this something that affects you deeply?

59:11.980 --> 59:13.490
I believe there's...

59:13.490 --> 59:17.040
I believe in God, I don't believe in religion.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.550
I mean, everybody finds themselves

59:18.550 --> 59:19.750
sitting alone, talking to someone

59:19.750 --> 59:21.733
at some point in time.

59:23.810 --> 59:25.589
I get tired of talking to the mirror

59:25.589 --> 59:28.006
every now and then, you know?

59:39.929 --> 59:42.346
Here, Shannon, make a wish.

59:47.205 --> 59:48.905
I have one more wish I gotta make.

59:55.550 --> 59:57.290
So what do you think has been the

59:57.290 --> 59:59.840
happiest moment in your life?

1:00:01.538 --> 1:00:03.538
The happiest moment...

1:00:09.592 --> 1:00:11.592
is probably yet to come.

1:00:13.097 --> 1:00:15.106
Oh. What do you think

1:00:15.106 --> 1:00:19.023
has been the hardest thing? The hardest moment?

1:00:30.719 --> 1:00:32.370
The day after that girl took

1:00:32.370 --> 1:00:34.453
a flying leap in Detroit.

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:38.370
We got done playing

1:00:39.380 --> 1:00:42.810
over at Saint Andrew's Hall, which is right there.

1:00:42.810 --> 1:00:46.910
And we've seen all these people down here on the corner

1:00:46.910 --> 1:00:49.987
we realized there was a girl that was 20 floors up,

1:00:49.987 --> 1:00:52.810
on the hotel edge up here.

1:00:52.810 --> 1:00:55.560
Police were called, they blocked this whole street off,

1:00:57.299 --> 1:00:59.170
and she jumped.

1:00:59.170 --> 1:01:00.013
Hit the street.

1:01:04.570 --> 1:01:05.403
Man, what'd y'all do

1:01:05.403 --> 1:01:06.247
when you went back to the-

1:01:06.247 --> 1:01:07.520
It was silent.

1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:11.590
We left the show, you know, we didn't stay.

1:01:11.590 --> 1:01:15.323
We canceled our after show thing, and we left.

1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:21.753
Why?

1:01:23.469 --> 1:01:25.036
(clears throat)

1:01:25.036 --> 1:01:26.513
I don't know why.

1:01:28.737 --> 1:01:31.607
You're sort of ashamed that you've seen it.

1:01:31.607 --> 1:01:33.357
You know what I mean?

1:01:37.790 --> 1:01:39.730
You wonder, you just wonder all these questions.

1:01:39.730 --> 1:01:44.041
You're bombarded with a million questions on

1:01:44.041 --> 1:01:46.117
"why," you know, "why this?"

1:01:46.117 --> 1:01:49.687
"Why that?" "If this," you know? "If that?"

1:01:51.473 --> 1:01:52.330
You know? And it's something that...

1:01:52.330 --> 1:01:54.883
that makes you grow somewhere.

1:01:54.883 --> 1:01:55.716
Yeah.

1:01:55.716 --> 1:01:56.549
It's just right now,

1:01:56.549 --> 1:01:59.187
I can't pinpoint where, you know...

1:01:59.187 --> 1:02:00.080
You think there's a song

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:02.480
that could come out of this?

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:05.538
I wouldn't even know where to begin. There's...

1:02:05.538 --> 1:02:08.088
It's definitely something that I will never forget.

1:02:16.648 --> 1:02:18.513
âª I can't tell you âª

1:02:18.513 --> 1:02:23.480
âª How many ways that I have sat and viewed my life today âª

1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:27.308
âª But I can tell you that I can't seem to find âª

1:02:27.308 --> 1:02:30.735
âª An easy way âª

1:02:30.735 --> 1:02:33.771
âª So if I see you walking hand in hand in hand âª

1:02:33.771 --> 1:02:37.495
âª With a three-armed man âª

1:02:37.495 --> 1:02:40.920
âª I'll understand âª

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:45.920
âª Should have been in my shoes yesterday âª

1:02:47.799 --> 1:02:51.549
âª Been in my shoes yesterday âª

1:02:59.196 --> 1:03:00.982
(clapping)

1:03:00.982 --> 1:03:02.163
Excellent. Live Blind Melon,

1:03:02.163 --> 1:03:04.420
and that song is yet untitled.

1:03:04.420 --> 1:03:05.300
Why do we even pay-

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:09.090
why do people imitate what they see on television?

1:03:09.090 --> 1:03:11.810
And why does the Jackson family get to hand out awards?

1:03:11.810 --> 1:03:14.240
And why do billions of people go to see "Ace Ventura: Pet

1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:15.940
Detective?" Why?

1:03:15.940 --> 1:03:17.800
Our first guests, we're just going to

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:19.830
get right to them because they're such a hot band.

1:03:19.830 --> 1:03:20.959
This is Blind Melon.

1:03:20.959 --> 1:03:23.709
(crowd cheering)

1:03:25.457 --> 1:03:28.278
When this bizarre real life movie continues.

1:03:28.278 --> 1:03:30.010
It's not going to hold me!

1:03:30.010 --> 1:03:31.766
On the scoreboard, they're running a clock,

1:03:31.766 --> 1:03:33.570
it's up to one minute and seven seconds.

1:03:33.570 --> 1:03:35.753
Turn it into positive energy, Tanya.

1:03:35.753 --> 1:03:38.800
Oh, God. Front cover of TIME right there.

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.510
Whether it's a costume, or-

1:03:40.510 --> 1:03:43.460
More on the life and work of John Candy.

1:03:43.460 --> 1:03:46.122
Several short stories and 1000 poems,

1:03:46.122 --> 1:03:48.160
Charles Bukowski dead at 73.

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:49.680
Not a pretty day on Wall Street,

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:51.662
stock prices have fallen sharply-

1:03:51.662 --> 1:03:53.167
(laughing)

1:03:53.167 --> 1:03:55.167
Best New Artist.

1:04:05.630 --> 1:04:06.547
Blind Melon

1:04:07.420 --> 1:04:09.470
And the Grammy goes to...

1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:18.290
Toni Braxton.

1:04:18.290 --> 1:04:19.403
No!

1:04:19.403 --> 1:04:20.856
(groaning)

1:04:20.856 --> 1:04:22.939
(crying)

1:04:31.277 --> 1:04:34.030
You know, man, we are so fucking alternative

1:04:34.030 --> 1:04:35.627
we couldn't even win a Grammy.

1:04:35.627 --> 1:04:36.460
Yeah.

1:04:36.460 --> 1:04:37.293
That's cool.

1:04:37.293 --> 1:04:38.570
That's why we didn't win.

1:04:38.570 --> 1:04:39.620
That's really cool.

1:04:41.862 --> 1:04:44.279
(rock music)

1:04:45.698 --> 1:04:46.586
(crowd cheering)

1:04:46.586 --> 1:04:48.794
It's all done. It's all done.

1:04:48.794 --> 1:04:50.627
The whole tour's done.

1:04:54.489 --> 1:04:56.572
Come on, Mr. Sun, get up.

1:04:57.547 --> 1:05:00.490
Come on, Mr. Sun, pop up.

1:05:00.490 --> 1:05:02.550
Oh, oh, you're right there.

1:05:02.550 --> 1:05:03.777
You're right there on the edge

1:05:03.777 --> 1:05:07.033
of the Goddamn fucking horizon, get up.

1:05:08.225 --> 1:05:10.402
Give me another day. Give me another day.

1:05:10.402 --> 1:05:13.985
Give me another day. Give me another day...

1:05:15.011 --> 1:05:16.311
What is your first name?

1:05:16.311 --> 1:05:17.348
Shannon.

1:05:17.348 --> 1:05:18.800
Shannon? You must be Irish.

1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:19.633
Yeah.

1:05:19.633 --> 1:05:20.466
I knew he was smart.

1:05:20.466 --> 1:05:21.870
Oh, my God. He's Irish.

1:05:21.870 --> 1:05:23.219
I knew he was smart.

1:05:23.219 --> 1:05:24.700
Are you saving your money?

1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:26.908
Yeah, I'm a fairly simple person.

1:05:26.908 --> 1:05:28.257
Well, you come from Indiana.

1:05:28.257 --> 1:05:31.213
Yeah, and it don't take a lot of money to live.

1:05:31.213 --> 1:05:32.860
I just, I want to have some kids.

1:05:32.860 --> 1:05:34.470
That's the only thing I want to do.

1:05:34.470 --> 1:05:36.840
Kid, save your fucking money. I'm gonna talk

1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:39.470
like a beast to you. Save your fucking money.

1:05:39.470 --> 1:05:40.681
Listen, here's what you do.

1:05:40.681 --> 1:05:43.001
The world is cruel!

1:05:43.001 --> 1:05:44.226
Cruel, cruel world.

1:05:44.226 --> 1:05:45.195
Here's what you do.

1:05:45.195 --> 1:05:47.263
Take a tip from us, we were all millionaires one time.

1:05:47.263 --> 1:05:49.502
Look at us now, we're bums.

1:05:49.502 --> 1:05:51.360
You're laughing. It's true.

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:52.193
Shannon.

1:05:52.193 --> 1:05:53.920
The most important thing in this world

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:57.263
is to take it easy, don't sweat it, and enjoy it.

1:05:57.263 --> 1:06:00.013
(waves crashing)

1:06:10.297 --> 1:06:12.880
That almost made it out here!

1:06:34.667 --> 1:06:37.417
(waves crashing)

1:07:08.583 --> 1:07:10.666
Kurt Cobain died today.

1:07:14.688 --> 1:07:15.938
Killed himself.

1:07:17.956 --> 1:07:20.643
I think a lot of people

1:07:20.643 --> 1:07:25.643
including his little baby girl, probably, are hurting.

1:07:28.733 --> 1:07:29.813
Don't you think?

1:07:31.033 --> 1:07:33.920
Kurt Cobain's body was found. He is dead.

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:36.753
A single shotgun blast to the head.

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:39.960
Not the answer. Definitely not the answer.

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:42.923
Your questions, 741-0997, your comments. Hello!

1:07:48.650 --> 1:07:51.390
Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain, extraordinarily gifted

1:07:51.390 --> 1:07:53.236
singer, songwriter, and guitarist was found

1:07:53.236 --> 1:07:54.069
dead in Seattle.

1:07:54.069 --> 1:07:57.267
Obviously very difficult for most people to understand,

1:07:57.267 --> 1:08:00.127
why someone who had all his dreams come true

1:08:00.127 --> 1:08:02.993
could still be in such incredible pain.

1:08:14.450 --> 1:08:16.700
I want to hear...

1:08:16.700 --> 1:08:17.770
Hear it from the beginning?

1:08:17.770 --> 1:08:20.211
Yeah. See how it's just-

1:08:20.211 --> 1:08:21.116
âª I'll pull the trigger âª

1:08:21.116 --> 1:08:24.155
âª Make it all go away âª

1:08:24.155 --> 1:08:26.938
âª I'll make it all go away âª

1:08:26.938 --> 1:08:30.105
âª Make it all go away âª

1:08:31.180 --> 1:08:32.280
Wait hold on, you know what?

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:33.270
Stop. Stop for a minute.

1:08:33.270 --> 1:08:35.120
Let me think about this for a second.

1:08:36.170 --> 1:08:38.400
So I sit and I think about...

1:08:56.939 --> 1:08:59.022
(groans)

1:08:59.952 --> 1:09:02.514
(mirror squeaks)

1:09:02.514 --> 1:09:06.847
You know, you just have this self-realization thing.

1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:11.454
I couldn't sleep.

1:09:11.454 --> 1:09:15.080
And I couldn't sleep for, for like, almost

1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:17.120
like a day and a half, two days, because

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.340
I was just thinking about all these problems

1:09:19.340 --> 1:09:20.510
I had encountered through my life

1:09:20.510 --> 1:09:22.920
that I never really dealt with that I swept

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:25.550
under this mental rug in my head, you know?

1:09:25.550 --> 1:09:28.040
And like I thought about, I thought about how

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:31.480
I wanted to get where I'm at now and how happy I would be.

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:35.773
How much I wanted to do music enough to leave my home.

1:09:37.900 --> 1:09:39.070
And I thought about this feeling

1:09:39.070 --> 1:09:42.490
that I would have when I got to a certain point.

1:09:42.490 --> 1:09:45.420
And when I got to that point, I wasn't happy.

1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:47.097
That feeling that I thought I was going to have

1:09:47.097 --> 1:09:50.959
for all those years wasn't there, and I didn't know why.

1:09:50.959 --> 1:09:54.340
And then all of a sudden for like 48 hours

1:09:54.340 --> 1:09:55.240
I'm going back through my life,

1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.173
and I'm thinking about all these things that I did wrong

1:09:57.173 --> 1:09:59.210
how I could've dealt with them.

1:09:59.210 --> 1:10:01.103
What are you videotaping?

1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:03.233
I have the freedom to do this.

1:10:03.233 --> 1:10:04.510
I know, I'm just asking a question

1:10:04.510 --> 1:10:06.420
I'm not stopping you from videotaping, I'm just asking-

1:10:06.420 --> 1:10:08.320
I know. You can't stop me from videotaping

1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:10.770
because I am an American citizen.

1:10:10.770 --> 1:10:12.941
Congratulations. Why are you videotaping?

1:10:12.941 --> 1:10:15.608
(phone ringing)

1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:18.930
And then you kind of almost

1:10:18.930 --> 1:10:21.080
take yourself back to the frame of mind you were in

1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:23.486
right before. Do you know what I'm talking about?

1:10:23.486 --> 1:10:24.890
You're scaring me, okay.

1:10:24.890 --> 1:10:26.388
But listen, you kind of

1:10:26.388 --> 1:10:28.290
take yourself back to that frame of mind.

1:10:28.290 --> 1:10:30.760
You can actually almost feel the same nervous feeling

1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:32.597
that you had before you did whatever it was

1:10:32.597 --> 1:10:34.560
you did that wasn't right.

1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:37.250
And then you think about how you could have handled it.

1:10:37.250 --> 1:10:39.270
And by doing that, man, it's like, you almost just

1:10:39.270 --> 1:10:40.330
relived it.

1:10:40.330 --> 1:10:42.210
You almost relived it.

1:10:42.210 --> 1:10:43.700
I was overwhelmed.

1:10:43.700 --> 1:10:44.930
I was so overwhelmed.

1:10:44.930 --> 1:10:47.717
If I had waited until I was 50

1:10:47.717 --> 1:10:50.783
before I realized these things, at least you realize it.

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:05.390
Hi, Lisa. It's Domenique calling.

1:11:05.390 --> 1:11:08.630
I was checking in with you to see how Shannon's doing,

1:11:08.630 --> 1:11:10.679
and what's going on and all that other stuff.

1:11:10.679 --> 1:11:12.187
If you want to leave a message

1:11:12.187 --> 1:11:15.293
if you're in now, my man. Let's party! Later.

1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:23.620
Landy, I just got out of rehab. I can't.

1:11:23.620 --> 1:11:24.800
I wish I could.

1:11:26.804 --> 1:11:28.373
I just need to know if it's cool with you

1:11:28.373 --> 1:11:30.316
if I give Mike McCready your phone number.

1:11:30.316 --> 1:11:32.316
He is in rehab and he is

1:11:34.306 --> 1:11:36.970
frightened about when he comes out and he was kind of hoping

1:11:36.970 --> 1:11:39.601
maybe he could talk to you about it.

1:11:39.601 --> 1:11:41.290
Hey Shannon, this is McCready again,

1:11:41.290 --> 1:11:43.007
just calling to see what's up.

1:11:43.007 --> 1:11:45.621
Just been kind of going up and down today,

1:11:45.621 --> 1:11:48.121
having some weird emotions and

1:11:48.121 --> 1:11:50.028
I don't know, I just wanted to call and see what's up.

1:11:50.028 --> 1:11:54.889
If you have any of the same kind of feelings and stuff.

1:11:54.889 --> 1:11:56.213
Damn. What a friendly message.

1:11:56.213 --> 1:11:58.270
Hey, Hoon, this is Lyle. Just calling to see what

1:11:58.270 --> 1:12:00.470
was up. Hadn't heard from you.

1:12:00.470 --> 1:12:01.870
Heard they finally turned you loose,

1:12:01.870 --> 1:12:03.180
and just wanted to give you a call.

1:12:03.180 --> 1:12:05.090
If I don't hear from you, I guess I will

1:12:05.090 --> 1:12:06.783
see you in Amsterdam.

1:12:07.967 --> 1:12:09.610
It's next weekend.

1:12:09.610 --> 1:12:11.933
Well, take it easy man. Talk to you later. Bye.

1:12:13.241 --> 1:12:14.979
Hey Shannon Hoon, it's Paul Cummings.

1:12:14.979 --> 1:12:16.530
I wanted to make sure you got your plane tickets

1:12:16.530 --> 1:12:18.440
and that kind of stuff.

1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:21.257
All right, we'll see you in a couple of days!

1:12:23.626 --> 1:12:24.940
Give it a lot of light?

1:12:24.940 --> 1:12:25.773
Okay.

1:12:27.420 --> 1:12:29.037
Okay.

1:12:29.037 --> 1:12:29.954
Oh, gosh...

1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:36.840
Okay. So, will the little green ever grow back?

1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:38.780
I mean, I don't even care about the distortion

1:12:38.780 --> 1:12:40.980
of the shape, I just want it to live.

1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:42.820
So, okay. Thank you very much.

1:12:42.820 --> 1:12:43.653
Bye-bye.

1:12:49.410 --> 1:12:51.300
First he said it sounded really bad.

1:12:51.300 --> 1:12:52.570
And then he changed his tune

1:12:52.570 --> 1:12:55.870
because you said that if I can bend, you know what I mean?

1:12:55.870 --> 1:12:59.810
If he bends and he just doesn't break

1:12:59.810 --> 1:13:01.390
like if the limbs just don't break off.

1:13:01.390 --> 1:13:03.700
He said, then there's probably still life.

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:04.533
Right.

1:13:05.580 --> 1:13:07.990
Wow, I wonder what happened, then, I mean...

1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:12.990
My sister's talking to her about the plant.

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:17.460
And she's lying. Saying she watered it,

1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:19.697
when it's quite obvious that she didn't.

1:13:24.115 --> 1:13:26.303
The ordeal has sapped her energy,

1:13:26.303 --> 1:13:29.452
and the pain from the bite in her back leg is obvious,

1:13:29.452 --> 1:13:32.920
as she keeps it from touching the other one.

1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:34.413
She is totally vulnerable.

1:13:38.290 --> 1:13:40.573
Well, why don't you fucking help her?

1:13:43.116 --> 1:13:44.843
In concert news, Blind Melon has bailed out of the

1:13:44.843 --> 1:13:46.920
final two and a half weeks of it's current

1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:49.820
European tour, apparently because singer Shannon Hoon,

1:13:49.820 --> 1:13:52.470
feeling somewhat depleted after a month long rehab stint

1:13:52.470 --> 1:13:54.530
for alcohol and drug abuse, feels the band

1:13:54.530 --> 1:13:56.307
isn't quite up to par right now.

1:13:56.307 --> 1:13:57.890
"I don't feel it's right for our fans to pay

1:13:57.890 --> 1:13:59.970
for something they might not want to see and hear,"

1:13:59.970 --> 1:14:02.020
he says. Blind Melon is still scheduled

1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:04.020
to do some opening act dates with the Rolling Stones

1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:05.140
later this summer.

1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:07.843
Yeah. We canceled our European tour.

1:14:11.263 --> 1:14:13.430
I'm just tired of playing.

1:14:14.830 --> 1:14:16.980
Yeah. We're getting along all right, but...

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:20.993
No.

1:14:22.561 --> 1:14:25.311
(toilet flushes)

1:14:37.273 --> 1:14:39.679
Will I see a beluga at all?

1:14:39.679 --> 1:14:40.512
Huh?

1:14:40.512 --> 1:14:42.016
Will I see a beluga?

1:14:42.016 --> 1:14:44.416
A beluga?
Did you see that?

1:14:44.416 --> 1:14:48.749
I don't know, they said there are belugas in here.

1:14:50.501 --> 1:14:51.497
This is kind of a rude question,

1:14:51.497 --> 1:14:53.689
but it comes straight from the mouth of my

1:14:53.689 --> 1:14:57.242
13 year old nephew. Who, when the subject of Blind Melon

1:14:57.242 --> 1:14:59.897
came up over the holidays, said

1:14:59.897 --> 1:15:01.730
"Oh, one-hit wonders."

1:15:02.768 --> 1:15:04.597
Well, you know what?

1:15:04.597 --> 1:15:05.473
The way you want to think of it

1:15:05.473 --> 1:15:09.160
and the way your 13 year old kid wants to think about it

1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:12.580
is entirely up to you and your 13 year old child.

1:15:12.580 --> 1:15:15.300
If you don't embrace it it's not going to break my heart.

1:15:15.300 --> 1:15:17.990
You know, how come they always put the lights

1:15:17.990 --> 1:15:19.360
right on that side?

1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:22.500
Because I'm not the star.

1:15:22.500 --> 1:15:23.703
Who is the star?

1:15:23.703 --> 1:15:25.937
There's no stars here.

1:15:25.937 --> 1:15:28.587
I read some juicy stuff in the Rolling Stone.

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:33.210
Jesus. Alcohol and smashing things in hotel rooms

1:15:33.210 --> 1:15:35.293
and urinating on Canadian crowds?

1:15:37.010 --> 1:15:38.140
To make your first record

1:15:38.140 --> 1:15:40.220
and have it start doing well,

1:15:40.220 --> 1:15:42.860
people are going to now see us

1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:46.633
mature in a very microscopic situation.

1:15:51.966 --> 1:15:54.750
A lot of people are offended because they believed

1:15:54.750 --> 1:15:57.730
in what MTV portrayed us to be all about.

1:15:57.730 --> 1:15:59.300
No one is going to know what I'm about

1:15:59.300 --> 1:16:01.660
from one video...

1:16:01.660 --> 1:16:02.640
and a bee girl

1:16:03.812 --> 1:16:05.133
and a cute little story.

1:16:07.761 --> 1:16:09.800
And it's up to the individual to realize

1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:11.550
how much it has to do with reality.

1:16:17.013 --> 1:16:19.680
You can't believe everything you're watching.

1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:20.583
So wake up.

1:16:28.007 --> 1:16:31.757
(helicopter blades whirring)

1:16:37.420 --> 1:16:38.420
Wow.

1:16:42.716 --> 1:16:45.170
230 to 250,000 people here now.

1:16:45.170 --> 1:16:48.060
If there's not at least 500,000 people here by Sunday,

1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:49.460
we're going to be surprised.

1:16:59.767 --> 1:17:02.267
(blues music)

1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:09.991
Five minutes before the biggest show of his career,

1:17:09.991 --> 1:17:12.800
Shannon Hoon is playing with his video camera.

1:17:18.825 --> 1:17:21.575
(crowd cheering)

1:17:28.290 --> 1:17:29.847
This is a song called "Soup."

1:17:39.265 --> 1:17:42.118
âª The clothesline of cold eyes âª

1:17:42.118 --> 1:17:46.679
âª Is washing away the face before âª

1:17:46.679 --> 1:17:48.591
âª Now, tell me what's wrong âª

1:17:48.591 --> 1:17:50.326
âª You see everyone's gone âª

1:17:50.326 --> 1:17:54.677
âª You've got to do your best to decorate this dying day âª

1:17:54.677 --> 1:17:59.533
âª This dying day âª

1:17:59.533 --> 1:18:04.533
âª All over a bowl of bitter beans âª

1:18:08.832 --> 1:18:13.832
âª All over a bowl of bitter beans âª

1:18:15.288 --> 1:18:18.721
âª And outside, way, way up high âª

1:18:18.721 --> 1:18:23.595
âª I got a quarter moon mist hanging over me âª

1:18:23.595 --> 1:18:27.502
âª And now I want that rocking chair out of there âª

1:18:27.502 --> 1:18:30.201
âª 'Cause it's no longer needed here âª

1:18:30.201 --> 1:18:35.201
âª It's no longer needed here âª

1:18:38.821 --> 1:18:43.821
âª All over a bowl of bitter beans âª

1:18:47.734 --> 1:18:52.734
âª All over a bowl of bitter beans âª

1:18:54.136 --> 1:18:57.717
âª I got a corner story that's all the more âª

1:18:57.717 --> 1:19:02.463
âª For me to praise upon the holidays âª

1:19:02.463 --> 1:19:06.657
âª And now I'll close my eyes really, really tight âª

1:19:06.657 --> 1:19:09.655
âª And I'll make you all go away âª

1:19:09.655 --> 1:19:11.925
âª I'll make you all go away âª

1:19:11.925 --> 1:19:15.175
âª I'll make you all go âª

1:19:27.398 --> 1:19:29.315
âª Away âª

1:19:42.786 --> 1:19:44.467
âª Well, I'll pull the trigger âª

1:19:44.467 --> 1:19:47.378
âª And I'll make it all go away âª

1:19:47.378 --> 1:19:50.077
âª And I'll make it all go away âª

1:19:50.077 --> 1:19:53.660
âª I'll make it all go away âª

1:19:56.009 --> 1:19:58.342
(vocalizes)

1:20:08.890 --> 1:20:11.223
(vocalizes)

1:20:20.510 --> 1:20:23.427
(helicopter whirs)

1:20:30.990 --> 1:20:33.310
You talked about doing a recording situation

1:20:33.310 --> 1:20:35.430
in New Orleans. I don't know if you're still on that track.

1:20:35.430 --> 1:20:37.033
If you'd like to do that for your next record,

1:20:37.033 --> 1:20:39.040
and record in a house.

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:40.696
Daniel Lanois has a house in New Orleans.

1:20:40.696 --> 1:20:41.910
He's already doing that.

1:20:41.910 --> 1:20:42.743
Really?

1:20:42.743 --> 1:20:44.530
Yes.

1:20:44.530 --> 1:20:45.430
Hello?

1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:11.393
New Orleans.

1:21:15.950 --> 1:21:17.893
Is this thing wacked out of tune?

1:21:20.586 --> 1:21:22.419
It's just kind of...

1:21:23.947 --> 1:21:25.560
Kind of had it's best days, you know?

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:26.472
Yeah.

1:21:26.472 --> 1:21:27.305
As far as intonation goes.

1:21:27.305 --> 1:21:28.320
What gig is this?

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:30.195
Blind Melon.

1:21:30.195 --> 1:21:32.013
Are y'all from here? Or you just brought in the...

1:21:32.013 --> 1:21:34.180
No, ah, I like it down here, but it's

1:21:34.180 --> 1:21:36.761
too much of a cesspool of things that I really...

1:21:36.761 --> 1:21:39.168
There's a lot of cesspool shit.

1:21:39.168 --> 1:21:40.480
I have to be an arm's length away

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.881
from most of it otherwise my metabolism,

1:21:42.881 --> 1:21:45.482
fucking, is all fucked up.

1:21:45.482 --> 1:21:47.899
(rock music)

1:22:08.993 --> 1:22:11.090
They got me fucking...

1:22:11.090 --> 1:22:12.007
they got me

1:22:13.384 --> 1:22:15.884
accused of a lot of shit, man.

1:22:17.907 --> 1:22:19.660
And all the way down to the police station,

1:22:19.660 --> 1:22:21.450
I still was fucking thinking that

1:22:21.450 --> 1:22:23.550
they should have arrested the other guy too.

1:22:23.550 --> 1:22:27.350
I reaffirm myself how much I don't need to drink.

1:22:27.350 --> 1:22:29.473
I wish Jeff would've just knocked me out.

1:22:30.393 --> 1:22:32.893
(music plays)

1:22:44.806 --> 1:22:47.306
(music stops)

1:22:49.857 --> 1:22:52.387
I can't believe you're pregnant either.

1:22:55.980 --> 1:22:58.097
The egg is in, like, one of the ovaries.

1:22:58.097 --> 1:23:00.630
Or had just released from the ovary, and

1:23:00.630 --> 1:23:02.646
it doesn't even attach or live off of your body

1:23:02.646 --> 1:23:04.431
for, like, two weeks.

1:23:04.431 --> 1:23:05.848
Huh? All right.

1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:09.803
No, no, no, nothing.

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:14.927
Well, it's not too hard to figure out

1:23:14.927 --> 1:23:16.760
that Lisa is pregnant.

1:24:12.091 --> 1:24:13.424
Merry Christmas.

1:24:15.208 --> 1:24:18.958
(upbeat country music plays)

1:24:21.357 --> 1:24:24.130
You know, I do my best to not make a mess of things.

1:24:24.130 --> 1:24:26.080
Although, people would never know that.

1:24:28.197 --> 1:24:29.480
What are you doing?

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:30.690
You want to go back?

1:24:30.690 --> 1:24:31.630
What are you doing?

1:24:31.630 --> 1:24:32.850
I gotta get all this shit home.

1:24:32.850 --> 1:24:33.820
Right.

1:24:33.820 --> 1:24:34.653
Well, that's fine.

1:24:34.653 --> 1:24:36.600
We can always come back when we're done.

1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:37.562
Do it then.

1:24:37.562 --> 1:24:39.335
When I leave this city,

1:24:39.335 --> 1:24:41.185
I don't ever want to come back to it.

1:24:42.495 --> 1:24:43.328
I can understand that.

1:24:43.328 --> 1:24:44.161
Amen.

1:24:54.464 --> 1:24:56.758
Today is the day

1:24:56.758 --> 1:25:00.590
we find out if it's a girl or a boy.

1:25:00.590 --> 1:25:02.853
Does it feel like a boy or a girl?

1:25:02.853 --> 1:25:05.553
It feels like a girl to me, but I really don't know.

1:25:07.132 --> 1:25:09.740
But I guess I'll go with a girl...

1:25:09.740 --> 1:25:11.240
Since you're going with a boy.

1:25:12.780 --> 1:25:14.123
See who wins the bet.

1:25:16.250 --> 1:25:17.889
Winner gets the kid.

1:25:17.889 --> 1:25:19.173
Yeah, right.

1:25:25.590 --> 1:25:26.673
There she is!

1:25:29.892 --> 1:25:31.975
There's her little heart.

1:25:35.123 --> 1:25:38.433
We're done now with our kitchen.

1:25:40.144 --> 1:25:41.811
Got this area to do.

1:25:48.990 --> 1:25:50.450
Which has been hit hard by Russian

1:25:50.450 --> 1:25:53.550
shelling, the Chechens are still defying the odds

1:25:53.550 --> 1:25:55.533
battling the latest Russian onslaught.

1:26:01.010 --> 1:26:04.373
One, two, three, four, five,

1:26:05.885 --> 1:26:08.218
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

1:26:10.498 --> 1:26:12.921
exhale, inhale, and push again.

1:26:12.921 --> 1:26:14.180
Easy, easy.

1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:15.745
Oh my God.

1:26:15.745 --> 1:26:17.450
(crying)

1:26:17.450 --> 1:26:19.130
Little bit of a push, now.

1:26:19.130 --> 1:26:21.336
Easy, easy, easy.

1:26:21.336 --> 1:26:23.833
Push. A little harder. Easy. Good.

1:26:24.907 --> 1:26:26.075
Oh, my God.

1:26:26.075 --> 1:26:27.073
Stop. Okay.

1:26:27.073 --> 1:26:28.054
(Lisa whimpering)

1:26:28.054 --> 1:26:31.230
Oh, my God. (crying)

1:26:31.230 --> 1:26:32.191
So it is a she.

1:26:32.191 --> 1:26:33.313
It is a she.

1:26:33.313 --> 1:26:34.833
Oh, my gosh.

1:26:36.410 --> 1:26:37.340
Here, let me get this for you,

1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:38.500
our first phone call.

1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:39.521
Hello?

1:26:39.521 --> 1:26:40.961
Who is this?

1:26:40.961 --> 1:26:41.794
Hi.

1:26:44.073 --> 1:26:45.752
Oh, she's too cute.

1:26:45.752 --> 1:26:47.585
Her lips are adorable.

1:26:48.758 --> 1:26:50.235
(baby whimpering)

1:26:50.235 --> 1:26:51.068
Hi.

1:26:53.207 --> 1:26:55.998
You've had a pretty busy day, haven't you?

1:26:55.998 --> 1:26:57.070
Come over and see dad!

1:26:57.070 --> 1:27:00.383
Hi! Hi, baby!

1:27:03.095 --> 1:27:04.678
Oh, she's precious.

1:27:14.228 --> 1:27:16.260
(baby whimpering)

1:27:16.260 --> 1:27:18.356
The last name's Hoon. H-O-O-N.

1:27:18.356 --> 1:27:20.189
(baby whimpering)

1:27:20.189 --> 1:27:22.754
Okay. Are we recording? Whoops, I can hardly

1:27:22.754 --> 1:27:23.640
read (unintelligible)

1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:25.013
Peek out at your momma.

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:28.133
Get your hand out of the way.

1:27:29.770 --> 1:27:30.603
Hi.

1:27:30.603 --> 1:27:31.780
You're a daddy now.

1:27:31.780 --> 1:27:32.683
Say hi.

1:27:39.300 --> 1:27:44.300
This is the face of a very tired breastfed baby.

1:27:47.235 --> 1:27:48.690
As you can see, she can barely hang on

1:27:48.690 --> 1:27:50.313
to her state of consciousness.

1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:54.093
Sorts of gurgling sounds, possible overflow.

1:28:03.910 --> 1:28:04.743
Mm-hmm.

1:28:07.950 --> 1:28:09.043
Oh, I see.

1:28:16.630 --> 1:28:18.413
Jerry Garcia was found dead today.

1:28:20.540 --> 1:28:22.800
She will now never be able to go to

1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:24.223
the Grateful Dead show.

1:28:25.540 --> 1:28:28.377
We're very sad about that, aren't we, little baby?

1:28:30.230 --> 1:28:33.250
We're getting ready to release our second album

1:28:33.250 --> 1:28:36.963
which we have entitled "Soup" for lack of any better ideas.

1:28:37.936 --> 1:28:40.603
(guitar twangs)

1:28:45.288 --> 1:28:47.337
You're dozing on me, bud.

1:28:47.337 --> 1:28:49.302
You're dozing.

1:28:49.302 --> 1:28:50.657
Are you with me, Shannon?

1:28:50.657 --> 1:28:51.490
Huh?

1:28:51.490 --> 1:28:52.650
Are you with me?

1:28:52.650 --> 1:28:53.500
Yeah.

1:28:54.870 --> 1:28:56.180
I'm sorry.

1:28:56.180 --> 1:28:58.313
You know I made the dreadful mistake of

1:28:58.313 --> 1:29:02.150
the end of the evening, you always run into that one person

1:29:02.150 --> 1:29:04.660
who's holding that one thing that

1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:05.960
you just...

1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:08.087
really, really want to say no.

1:29:12.703 --> 1:29:14.360
I'm not really ready to

1:29:15.810 --> 1:29:18.017
jump back into this with both feet.

1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:26.940
You know, I just want to be home with Lisa.

1:29:33.314 --> 1:29:36.214
What's the response been so far with the record?

1:29:38.242 --> 1:29:40.727
One and a half stars.

1:29:40.727 --> 1:29:42.477
One and a half stars.

1:29:44.236 --> 1:29:46.294
These reporters here want to talk to everybody

1:29:46.294 --> 1:29:48.627
but the guys in Blind Melon.

1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:51.593
Yep.

1:30:02.830 --> 1:30:04.460
How many more days left?

1:30:08.215 --> 1:30:12.465
âª Oh, please give me a little more âª

1:30:20.890 --> 1:30:21.770
Your red light's flashing.

1:30:21.770 --> 1:30:22.603
Why is it flashing?

1:30:22.603 --> 1:30:24.570
Is that powering down? Something going on?

1:30:31.730 --> 1:30:33.680
This city brings out the...

1:30:34.609 --> 1:30:35.853
the mental monsters.

1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:41.103
It's hard to put up with these guys.

1:30:42.976 --> 1:30:44.476
And you know what?

1:30:45.740 --> 1:30:47.450
Sometimes...

1:30:48.695 --> 1:30:52.203
I wish all of these guys would just get out of me.

1:31:09.389 --> 1:31:13.624
âª Happy birthday to you! âª

1:31:13.624 --> 1:31:17.623
âª Happy birthday to you! âª

1:31:17.623 --> 1:31:22.360
âª Happy birthday dear daddy! âª

1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:26.500
âª Happy birthday to you! âª

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:28.100
And many more!

1:31:41.303 --> 1:31:43.553
(clapping)

1:31:47.992 --> 1:31:50.189
âª It isn't me âª

1:31:50.189 --> 1:31:55.189
âª No, no, no, no, it isn't me âª

1:31:55.417 --> 1:31:59.619
âª No, no, no, no, it isn't me âª

1:31:59.619 --> 1:32:01.302
âª No, no, it isn't me, âª

1:32:01.302 --> 1:32:02.464
âª No, it isn't me, âª

1:32:02.464 --> 1:32:04.095
âª No it isn't âª

1:32:04.095 --> 1:32:07.012
Planting her tree here,

1:32:08.250 --> 1:32:09.953
to commemorate the baptism.

1:32:12.815 --> 1:32:15.315
(dog barking)

1:32:19.310 --> 1:32:22.200
Look, Shannon. This would be a cute picture.

1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:23.623
Look, Shannon.

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:25.790
We need to get a picture of that.

1:32:25.790 --> 1:32:26.623
So will you hold her,

1:32:26.623 --> 1:32:27.487
and et me go get my camera?

1:32:28.805 --> 1:32:30.380
Just sit down and talk to her.

1:32:30.380 --> 1:32:31.880
You're taller than the tree.

1:32:32.930 --> 1:32:34.913
You're like 10 feet taller!

1:32:36.481 --> 1:32:37.398
Aren't you?

1:32:45.572 --> 1:32:47.081
(groans)

1:32:47.081 --> 1:32:50.081
You're 10 feet taller than the tree.

1:33:04.238 --> 1:33:09.238
âª Now when I open my eyes to start another day âª

1:33:10.575 --> 1:33:12.313
âª I'm in a pile of puke âª

1:33:12.313 --> 1:33:14.211
âª Empty bag of excuses âª

1:33:14.211 --> 1:33:16.614
âª Got love for my friends and my family âª

1:33:16.614 --> 1:33:17.946
âª Don't you know I need them âª

1:33:17.946 --> 1:33:21.850
âª Under a sun that's seen it all before âª

1:33:21.850 --> 1:33:23.676
âª All before âª

1:33:23.676 --> 1:33:27.150
âª And my feet are so cold âª

1:33:27.150 --> 1:33:29.576
âª And I can't believe âª

1:33:29.576 --> 1:33:33.778
âª I have to bang my head against this wall again âª

1:33:33.778 --> 1:33:36.519
âª Well, the blows they have just a little âª

1:33:36.519 --> 1:33:38.937
âª More space in between them âª

1:33:38.937 --> 1:33:41.197
âª Oh, yeah âª

1:33:41.197 --> 1:33:45.391
âª Take a breath and I will try and and try and try again âª

1:33:45.391 --> 1:33:46.583
âª Oh yeah âª

1:33:46.583 --> 1:33:48.621
âª I'm going to try again âª

1:33:48.621 --> 1:33:49.718
âª Oh, yeah âª

1:33:49.718 --> 1:33:51.875
âª I'm going to try again âª

1:33:51.875 --> 1:33:52.908
âª Oh yeah âª

1:33:52.908 --> 1:33:54.435
âª You know I'm going âª

1:33:54.435 --> 1:33:55.851
âª You know I'm going âª

1:33:55.851 --> 1:33:59.851
âª To give it one more try again âª

1:34:18.521 --> 1:34:20.359
Lisa!

1:34:20.359 --> 1:34:21.552
(laughing)

1:34:21.552 --> 1:34:22.385
Hurry!

1:34:25.491 --> 1:34:28.829
âª Leaving me behind âª

1:34:28.829 --> 1:34:32.329
âª Oh, just bring it to me âª

1:34:52.018 --> 1:34:54.851
(camera clatters)

1:35:00.832 --> 1:35:02.165
Hey.

1:35:04.352 --> 1:35:06.352
I do too. I gotta sleep.

1:35:08.816 --> 1:35:10.983
What time is it right now?

1:35:16.969 --> 1:35:17.802
Well...

1:35:18.844 --> 1:35:19.677
I want you to call me

1:35:19.677 --> 1:35:24.177
and let me know about that flight as soon as possible.

1:35:34.107 --> 1:35:36.607
Tomorrow. Tonight or tomorrow.

1:35:38.499 --> 1:35:39.332
Yeah.

1:35:46.852 --> 1:35:49.170
Yeah, but you know what?

1:35:49.170 --> 1:35:53.633
I, like, really need to get off that fucking bus.

1:36:03.428 --> 1:36:06.336
Yeah. If she says her first word I don't know

1:36:06.336 --> 1:36:08.253
how I'm going to- yeah.

1:36:18.999 --> 1:36:21.832
Is everything cool with my family?

1:36:38.994 --> 1:36:39.827
Yeah.

1:40:18.935 --> 1:40:21.935
(electronic reverb)
