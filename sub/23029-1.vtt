02:58.830 --> 03:01.820
- Good to see your face around here.
- Mm-hm.

03:01.900 --> 03:05.339

- No one else gives a shit, right?

03:32.663 --> 03:34.686
Well, at least he's got you.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.625

You let him out,
I'll kill him myself, lock him up.

03:59.187 --> 04:01.246
This is his third offense, Mark.

04:01.526 --> 04:04.927
I process him, he's in for a lot more
than an over-nighter.

04:06.364 --> 04:08.538
- All right.

- I have no idea.
- You must have seen something.

14:52.043 --> 14:54.265
I can't explain it. There was
a light shot out of a cannon.
