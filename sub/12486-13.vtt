Where, after revolutionizing
the world of technology,

CEO Zoltan Grundy has decided to
revolutionize the world of education.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.764
By opening up a school for prodigies.

00:20.765 --> 00:23.341
And I'm here with some
of the students. Hmm?

00:23.342 --> 00:25.882
So, you're a computer prodigy, right?

- I think this school is wonderful.
- Oh.

Much like the new zPhone 5!

and extra long battery life.

00:50.513 --> 00:54.179

including a high-resolution display,
eye-tracking technology, and of course,

13:08.463 --> 13:10.272
[Sighs] I can't sleep.

13:10.273 --> 13:14.277
I keep dreaming I'm a roll of quarters.

13:14.278 --> 13:16.011
Olive: You just have
to make the best of it.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.686
See, watch. Fletcher, wake up!

13:18.687 --> 13:20.907
What? Ow!

13:25.244 --> 13:26.680
This is outrageous.

13:26.681 --> 13:31.361
I specifically requested
a Queen-sized tube.

13:31.786 --> 13:34.788
Well, at least I get to
sleep next to my Sweetie.

13:34.789 --> 13:37.909
Aw. Thanks, cutie-pie.

13:38.926 --> 13:42.377
He meant me. And I'm up here.

13:42.378 --> 13:45.003
Wait. Angus, your sleeping
tube is next to mine?

13:45.004 --> 13:46.617
Sleeping tube?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.869
I'm in the bathroom tube.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.871
[All groaning]

13:50.872 --> 13:53.364
That's it! We can't live like this.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.333
I'm going to go talk to Mr. Hashimoto!

13:55.334 --> 13:56.857
I'll come with you.

13:56.858 --> 13:58.958
[Grunts]

14:00.138 --> 14:02.658
No, I won't.

14:10.282 --> 14:13.799
The plan has gone perfectly!

14:13.800 --> 14:17.703
Great job sabotaging the
zPhones so they would explode!

14:17.704 --> 14:21.707
No one suspects it was an inside job!

14:21.708 --> 14:23.709
Did he say what I think he said?

14:23.710 --> 14:28.630
I said, no one suspects
it was an inside job!

14:28.815 --> 14:33.615
I said... just call
me back on a land line!

14:41.828 --> 14:44.429
I'll have the bellhop get your bags.

14:44.430 --> 14:46.470
[Dings]

14:50.136 --> 14:51.836
Sorry I'm late.

14:51.837 --> 14:56.875
I had a little trouble getting
out of bed this morning.

14:56.876 --> 15:00.583
I can't work here another minute.
There's got to be something we can do.

15:00.584 --> 15:03.349
Well, there's lots of things
to do in beautiful Palo Alto.

15:03.350 --> 15:06.018
May I suggest a hot air balloon
ride over Silicon Valley?

15:06.019 --> 15:10.759
They leave every half
hour from Byxbee Park.

15:12.759 --> 15:17.799
Great. Now I need a broom.
[Elevator bell dings]

15:17.965 --> 15:20.665
I said a broom.

15:20.867 --> 15:23.292
Guys! Someone's done something terrible.

15:23.293 --> 15:26.972
That bathroom tube was
clogged when I got in it.

15:26.973 --> 15:30.369
No! I overheard Mr. Hashimoto talking.

15:30.370 --> 15:33.713
The phones aren't defective.
They were sabotaged!

15:33.714 --> 15:35.681
Mr. Hashimoto has a mole.

15:35.682 --> 15:36.395
[Gasps]

15:36.396 --> 15:41.542
He trained a small, burrowing
varmint to sabotage phones?

15:41.543 --> 15:44.903
He's a diabolical genius!

15:45.826 --> 15:50.897
It's got to be someone incredibly
intelligent, so it's not Fletcher.

15:50.898 --> 15:55.864
And it's got to be someone who can
keep a secret, so it's not Olive.

15:55.865 --> 16:00.841
It's got to be someone who's willing to
get their hands dirty, so it's not Lexi.

16:00.842 --> 16:06.742
It's got to be someone incredibly
focused, so it's not Angus.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.750
[Sighs] Come on, guys, think.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.853
Who would stand to gain the
most by bringing down Z-Tech?

16:12.854 --> 16:15.019
You know, Hashi...

16:15.020 --> 16:19.960
I've been a loyal employee of your
company for almost 36 hours now.

16:19.961 --> 16:22.559
I think I deserve a promotion.

16:22.560 --> 16:26.495
Maybe you could stop by
later and we can discuss it.

16:26.496 --> 16:29.316
I'm in tube 104.

16:31.906 --> 16:34.808
Did you see that?
Winter must be the mole!

16:34.809 --> 16:37.977
If she is, she'll never admit it.

16:37.978 --> 16:40.913
Mr. Hashimoto called
the mole from the roof.

16:40.914 --> 16:44.268
So, if we check the call log on Winter's
phone, we'll have the proof we need.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.637
How do we get her phone?
She never puts it down.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.185
Too bad you're not her phone.

16:48.186 --> 16:51.056
She puts you down all the time.

16:51.057 --> 16:52.691
I'll take care of it.

16:52.692 --> 16:56.371
I know the one thing
that no woman can resist.

16:56.372 --> 16:58.532
Calzones?

16:58.998 --> 17:01.316
No. A manicure.

17:01.317 --> 17:04.797
It's pronounced "manicotti".

17:10.977 --> 17:13.549
Okay, here's the plan.
We do Winter's nails.

17:13.550 --> 17:15.957
And when they're wet, she'll
be forced to put down her phone.

17:15.958 --> 17:19.952
Then we grab it and check the call log.

17:19.953 --> 17:22.821
It was so nice of you guys
to offer me a manicure.

17:22.823 --> 17:28.723
Like most women, I would've preferred
manicotti, but this is the next best thing.

17:29.964 --> 17:32.379
You deserve it, boss.

17:32.380 --> 17:36.347
Of course you won't be able to text
while we're working on your hands.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.688
No problem.

17:46.112 --> 17:49.234
You know what would go
well with your manicure?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.849
A pedicure!

17:50.850 --> 17:53.370
Sounds lovely.

17:59.025 --> 18:01.469
Mr. Grundy, this may
come as a shock to you,

18:01.470 --> 18:06.613
but we think Mr. Hashimoto had
Winter sabotage the zPhones.

18:06.614 --> 18:07.942
Wow.

18:07.943 --> 18:12.905
When you pretend marry someone,
you think you can trust them.

18:12.906 --> 18:15.069
Unfortunately, we can't prove it.

18:15.070 --> 18:16.600
We tried everything.

18:16.601 --> 18:20.261
Spa treatments, Italian food...

18:20.482 --> 18:24.717
Actually, it was just those two things.

18:24.718 --> 18:28.198
- Winter's coming!
- Hodor.

18:28.722 --> 18:30.757
I can prove who did it!

18:30.758 --> 18:32.925
Why are you not mopping the restroom?

18:32.926 --> 18:35.728
We cannot afford another
bad online review.

18:35.729 --> 18:41.629
I don't know who this Groltan Zundy is,
but that two-star rating really hurt.

18:42.836 --> 18:47.907
Forget stars. You'll be getting
stripes, when you're in Alcatraz!

18:47.908 --> 18:50.316
Chyna, that makes no sense.

18:50.317 --> 18:53.642
Mr. Hashimoto will be remanded
to a working corrections facility,

18:53.643 --> 18:56.140
most likely Salinas Valley
or possibly Chino Hills.

18:56.141 --> 18:59.245
Alcatraz hasn't been an
operational prison since 1963, and

18:59.246 --> 19:01.854
is now under the purview of
the National Park Service.

19:01.855 --> 19:06.792
I can set you up on a tour,
leaving every hour from Pier 33.

19:06.793 --> 19:10.882
As I was saying... a long time ago...

19:10.883 --> 19:14.252
It turns out the zPhones
exploded due to a virus

19:14.253 --> 19:16.487
that was uploaded from
the saboteur's phone.

19:16.488 --> 19:20.873
I created a program that will
identify the culprit's phone.

19:20.874 --> 19:23.853
So when I press this button...

19:23.854 --> 19:29.069
It will send a signal to whoever
sabotaged Z-Tech, causing his or her...

19:29.070 --> 19:33.260
But in this case her phone to explode!

19:33.261 --> 19:35.341
Three...

19:35.342 --> 19:37.322
Two...

19:39.005 --> 19:40.296
- One!
- [Beeps]

19:40.297 --> 19:44.257
[Screams] We're all going to die!

19:46.899 --> 19:50.079
Kennedy? How could you?

19:50.212 --> 19:52.944
What? It wasn't me. My
phone didn't explode.

19:52.945 --> 19:53.977
Yeah.

19:53.978 --> 19:59.878
Don't accuse Kennedy just because you're
jealous she gets to be my girlfriend.

20:01.848 --> 20:05.717
Kennedy, I made up the whole
thing about back tracing the virus.

20:05.718 --> 20:07.311
But if you weren't guilty,

20:07.312 --> 20:10.194
then you wouldn't have been afraid
your phone was going to explode!

20:10.195 --> 20:14.310
- Why would you do this?
- Because it was her duty.

20:14.311 --> 20:16.605
As my daughter.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.886
All: What?

20:19.447 --> 20:22.317
It is true! My name is not Kennedy.

20:22.318 --> 20:26.038
It is Kumiko. Kumiko Hashimoto!

20:29.007 --> 20:31.605
When Grundy first announced this school,

20:31.606 --> 20:35.677
I knew it was the perfect opportunity
to infiltrate and gain your trust.

20:35.678 --> 20:39.295
So I can finally bring down Z-Tech!

20:39.296 --> 20:44.557
All she had to do was learn to speak
with your ridiculous American accent.

20:44.558 --> 20:48.521
[Mocking American accent] My
car gets 11 miles per gallon.

20:48.522 --> 20:51.522
I like potato chips.

20:52.899 --> 20:55.834
So, everything we know
about you is a lie?

20:55.835 --> 21:01.735
Well, it started that way, but I fell
in love with this place and all of you.

21:02.008 --> 21:03.741
Especially me.

21:03.742 --> 21:07.342
No. That part is still fake.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.016
I didn't want to sabotage the
zPhones, but my father made me.

21:12.017 --> 21:13.817
- [Scoffs]
- I'm sorry.

21:13.818 --> 21:18.125
You're finished, Hashimoto. I
will retake control of Z-Tech,

21:18.126 --> 21:22.106
and my school and do everything
in my power to lock you up in...

21:22.107 --> 21:24.343
Salinas Valley Correctional Institution.

21:24.344 --> 21:26.264
Yeah!

21:26.831 --> 21:28.577
You'll never catch me!

21:28.578 --> 21:32.837
Because you Westerners
are too lazy to run!

21:32.838 --> 21:35.408
He's getting away! After him!

21:35.409 --> 21:37.475
But he's all the way over there now.

21:37.476 --> 21:39.779
Yeah. That is pretty far.

21:39.780 --> 21:41.948
Oh! Well, we tried.

21:41.949 --> 21:44.289
He's fast.

21:46.898 --> 21:50.223
I got my company back, people
are buying zPhones again,

21:50.224 --> 21:53.745
and I'm once again worth billions.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.149
In case you're hiring...

21:56.150 --> 22:00.950
I've baked my resume
into a shepherd's pie.

22:01.137 --> 22:04.814
Because I like all things British.

22:04.815 --> 22:07.155
All things.

22:07.638 --> 22:09.737
[Sniffs] Ah!

22:09.738 --> 22:13.796
Everything is right
with the world again.

22:13.797 --> 22:17.517
You're still stuck in a tube.

22:17.658 --> 22:22.789
And there's only one way
you're gonna get out of there.

22:22.790 --> 22:27.830
In that case, there's
only one thing I can do.

22:28.620 --> 22:31.752
You think anyone will notice?

22:31.753 --> 22:33.717
Notice what?

22:33.718 --> 22:35.493
Hmm.

22:35.494 --> 22:41.394
