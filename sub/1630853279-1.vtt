WEBVTT

01:59.730 --> 02:00.730
Oh.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.760
You are conscious now.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.937
Thank God. I thought you are dead.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.730
S...sit tight.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.626
You know...

02:12.650 --> 02:14.560
Maybe you broke something.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.560
Don't move.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.000
Where am I?

02:19.780 --> 02:21.030
Why am I...

02:21.660 --> 02:23.210
Listen, sir.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.410
I've already called emergency.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.680
They are coming.

02:30.660 --> 02:31.660
So...

02:32.540 --> 02:34.450
I am leaving.

02:34.470 --> 02:35.900
Good luck.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.540
Sir.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.850
You are saying,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.586
that you don't remember who you are?

02:53.610 --> 02:55.210
And no ID?

02:56.110 --> 02:57.550
Your car

02:59.740 --> 03:01.926
was towed to Wonchang
junkyard in Ulsan.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.310
Take my card.

03:04.730 --> 03:07.350
The car is registered to Kang I-an.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.100
This is not you?

03:13.940 --> 03:15.850
Doctor said

03:15.930 --> 03:18.663
you have a gunshot wound
in your shoulder.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.640
You don't remember this?

03:23.540 --> 03:25.196
If it's really a gunshot wound,

03:25.220 --> 03:26.186
you need to report it to the police

03:26.210 --> 03:27.970
and clear all details.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.050
I asked for a room, we can talk there.

03:32.650 --> 03:34.080
Wait a bit.

03:34.850 --> 03:35.850
Ok.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.100
Maybe we should contact
criminal department?

05:27.860 --> 05:29.310
Ji Cheol-ho...

05:32.360 --> 05:33.590
Ji Cheol-ho...

06:06.610 --> 06:07.616
Make sure to check it.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.160
Let's talk at home.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.680
What is it?

06:22.050 --> 06:23.650
You don't feel good?

06:28.600 --> 06:29.640
What's wrong?

06:30.350 --> 06:31.970
What is it with him?

06:34.110 --> 06:35.430
Is he crazy?

06:55.790 --> 06:56.960
What is it?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.840
This is a dream...

07:05.210 --> 07:06.250
How come?

07:08.590 --> 07:09.800
Why so?

07:22.840 --> 07:24.100
What the...

07:24.120 --> 07:25.560
What is happening?

07:25.820 --> 07:26.820
I...

07:26.890 --> 07:27.890
I...

07:28.680 --> 07:31.066
How many times do I need to tell,
that it was not me?

07:31.090 --> 07:33.023
I told you, I don't remember.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.120
What are you talking about?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.150
Why would I do it?

07:38.430 --> 07:39.156
Hey.

07:39.180 --> 07:42.016
When I opened my eyes,
I was already at home.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.036
I'm coming to you.

07:43.060 --> 07:43.996
Let's meet.

07:44.020 --> 07:44.556
Hello?

07:44.580 --> 07:45.940
Are you really...

07:45.970 --> 07:46.970
Wait...

07:47.130 --> 07:48.200
Hold on!

07:57.330 --> 07:58.430
Wait...

07:58.610 --> 07:59.610
I'm not...

08:02.650 --> 08:03.660
Ah, wait!

08:03.680 --> 08:04.680
Get in!

08:13.030 --> 08:23.000
SPIRITWALKER

08:28.650 --> 08:30.520
ID. Lee Shin-woo.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.266
Delivery New World.
Chief Lee Shin-woo.

08:32.290 --> 08:33.440
Shin-woo?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.010
Chief.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.600
Chief Lee Shin-woo?

08:53.100 --> 08:54.700
You won't go inside?

08:59.350 --> 09:00.640
Chief Lee!

09:01.660 --> 09:03.260
What is it with him?

09:03.580 --> 09:05.020
Where is he going?

09:53.510 --> 09:56.050
This will nobody buy from you!

09:56.640 --> 09:58.750
Let's not bring useless stuff!

09:58.780 --> 09:59.746
It is not useless!

09:59.770 --> 10:00.586
Have a look!

10:00.610 --> 10:03.910
I just want to eat pancake.

10:03.940 --> 10:05.050
Ah?

10:05.700 --> 10:07.346
It is so delicious when it's hot...

10:07.370 --> 10:08.266
Then.

10:08.290 --> 10:09.970
Here is 1000 won for you.

10:10.050 --> 10:10.856
Take it.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.880
Thousand?

10:12.230 --> 10:13.620
Are you kidding?

10:13.640 --> 10:14.640
Don't want?

10:15.820 --> 10:17.360
Shithead.

10:17.430 --> 10:19.046
Took everything for himself, shithead.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.246
Don't buy alcohol!

10:20.270 --> 10:21.270
I won't!

10:22.280 --> 10:23.570
Yeah, yeah.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.650
You startled me.

10:33.290 --> 10:36.740
Is it not rude to take someone's seat?

10:40.820 --> 10:41.820
Oh God.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.230
Human life is priceless.

10:45.850 --> 10:48.290
Why spend it for this?

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
Sir.

10:50.380 --> 10:54.406
Do you remember the man who had
a car accident today in the morning?

10:54.430 --> 10:55.640
178cm tall.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.180
About 80kg weight?

10:58.120 --> 10:59.740
It was me.

11:01.650 --> 11:02.920
But suddenly

11:04.310 --> 11:05.830
I became like this.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.020
What?

11:08.130 --> 11:09.750
The body changed.

11:10.890 --> 11:12.380
Bullshit, right?

11:23.150 --> 11:24.066
You know,

11:24.090 --> 11:27.020
I don't quiet understand
what you mean.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.687
I don't know which one of them is me.

11:30.630 --> 11:32.440
I don't remember anything.

11:32.950 --> 11:34.486
I know where is Seoul

11:34.510 --> 11:37.150
and where is Gwanghwamun station.

11:38.630 --> 11:40.660
But who I am, I don't know.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.270
I think, I know.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.286
It's written here.

11:49.310 --> 11:51.577
"Delivery New World. Lee Shin-woo"

11:57.380 --> 11:59.200
This man is not me.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.680
Then who is he?

12:00.700 --> 12:01.920
This man.

12:02.310 --> 12:03.146
Lee Shin-woo?

12:03.170 --> 12:04.170
Yes?

12:04.250 --> 12:05.606
You see, you are Lee Shin-woo.

12:05.630 --> 12:07.116
I am not Lee Shin-woo.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.400
Then who is he?

12:08.430 --> 12:09.470
This man.

12:09.490 --> 12:10.896
And you are not Lee Shin-woo?

12:10.920 --> 12:11.586
No.

12:11.610 --> 12:12.726
And where is he?

12:12.750 --> 12:13.750
Right here.

12:13.780 --> 12:14.896
This man is Lee Shin-woo?

12:14.920 --> 12:16.196
Yes this man is Lee Shin-woo.

12:16.220 --> 12:17.580
Then who are you?

12:18.900 --> 12:19.910
I...

12:23.020 --> 12:25.066
Today in the morning you
wore a brown coat,

12:25.090 --> 12:26.756
a cap with Spider-Man,

12:26.780 --> 12:28.050
a green scarf

12:28.400 --> 12:29.640
and gloves.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.683
And you called the emergency.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.740
Then...

12:38.610 --> 12:40.846
that man in the morning didn't die,

12:40.870 --> 12:43.120
and now he is in that body?

12:43.380 --> 12:44.380
No.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.230
He was fine.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.096
But honestly don't know,
how he is now.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.130
Then

12:51.660 --> 12:53.660
it's Lee Shin-woo who is dead?

12:54.000 --> 12:54.836
No.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.046
Then who is dead?

12:56.070 --> 12:57.210
Nobody died!

12:57.250 --> 12:58.910
Both didn't die.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.690
And both are not me!

13:02.040 --> 13:03.720
How do you know this?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
What?

13:05.640 --> 13:07.296
You we saying, you
don't know who you are.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.920
So how can you know, that it's not you?

13:11.380 --> 13:12.530
Indeed.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.210
How can I know?

13:16.450 --> 13:17.446
Sir.

13:17.470 --> 13:18.470
Sir!

13:28.990 --> 13:31.100
Which one do you want most?

13:32.180 --> 13:32.706
What?

13:32.730 --> 13:33.546
Choose one.

13:33.570 --> 13:35.090
Will give for free.

13:35.310 --> 13:36.626
I don't want to eat it.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.626
Why you don't want?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.960
I see, you are staring at hotdog!

13:41.510 --> 13:45.590
You like it more than doughnut
or rice pancake.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
See.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.510
You exist.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.060
And you like it.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.080
Yes?

13:54.410 --> 13:56.270
And I like more

13:56.300 --> 13:57.980
this doughnut.

13:58.810 --> 14:00.050
Oh.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.280
Everyone has that period of life.

14:03.350 --> 14:04.630
All these people

14:04.660 --> 14:06.610
don't know who they are.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.360
But this is not important.

14:10.370 --> 14:11.256
In our life

14:11.280 --> 14:13.186
more important is where you are from

14:13.210 --> 14:14.546
and where you are heading to.

14:14.570 --> 14:16.250
So where are you from?

14:17.540 --> 14:18.740
You don't know?

14:19.960 --> 14:22.036
If you don't know,
then go to the beginning.

14:22.060 --> 14:25.460
That way you will find out
where you are heading to.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.040
What is it?

14:30.610 --> 14:31.610
Hey.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.146
What is it?

14:32.170 --> 14:34.210
Why did you help Kang I-an?!

14:34.230 --> 14:35.516
Remember something?

14:35.540 --> 14:36.746
How many times to repeat?!

14:36.770 --> 14:39.030
Go back to the very beginning.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.226
To the very beginning.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.410
Yes, right.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.880
There are many people,
who don't remember their past.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.170
Kang I-an is really...

14:56.750 --> 14:58.750
So you will continue that way?

14:58.790 --> 14:59.746
You don't believe?

14:59.770 --> 15:00.986
You don't believe me?!

15:01.010 --> 15:02.570
It was not me!

15:03.700 --> 15:05.090
Not me!

15:05.250 --> 15:07.556
I was doing everything,
what was ordered!

15:07.580 --> 15:08.406
Let go!

15:08.430 --> 15:09.386
Let go, damn!

15:09.410 --> 15:10.460
Let go!

15:11.720 --> 15:12.890
Wait!

15:14.490 --> 15:15.700
You shithead!

15:23.170 --> 15:24.520
Where am I?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.500
Who are you?

15:29.530 --> 15:30.530
What?

15:31.530 --> 15:34.063
You went back so far to the beginning?

15:36.380 --> 15:37.490
I

15:38.400 --> 15:40.080
will leave for a moment.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.456
Hey!

15:50.480 --> 15:51.900
Wait!

16:48.270 --> 16:49.700
What is it?

16:51.910 --> 16:54.030
Soon-Young, what is it?

16:54.060 --> 16:55.470
We will...

16:55.880 --> 16:56.726
Wait.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.456
Just listen...

16:57.480 --> 16:59.960
I think, somebody got inside.

16:59.980 --> 17:01.606
Then who? I put a sign.

17:01.630 --> 17:03.310
Somebody opened the door!

17:08.200 --> 17:10.070
Is there someone?

17:10.900 --> 17:11.766
Nobody is there!

17:11.790 --> 17:13.100
Sure there is!

17:13.130 --> 17:14.130
Look!

17:14.460 --> 17:15.496
Why are you doing this to me?

17:15.520 --> 17:16.800
Won't come out?!

17:19.780 --> 17:21.740
You didn't see the sign...

17:23.380 --> 17:24.530
Excuse me.

17:25.690 --> 17:26.800
We are...

17:30.120 --> 17:32.160
We are on business her.

17:32.990 --> 17:36.360
She just drank too much,
so she felt sick.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.923
This is not, what you are thinking.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.360
It changed again.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.990
During the day.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.480
And during the night.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.960
And during the night...

18:24.000 --> 18:25.180
12 o'clock.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.200
Calm down.

18:40.970 --> 18:42.650
Go back to the beginning.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.640
Yes.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.070
To the beginning.

18:47.840 --> 18:52.410
Junkyard Wonchang.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.610
Let's talk at home.

20:21.760 --> 20:28.160
"All this evil is coming from
inside and corrupting the man", God says.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.910
God says.

20:32.010 --> 20:33.790
Praise God.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.660
Praise God.

20:35.690 --> 20:38.410
Dear brothers and sisters,

20:38.430 --> 20:41.480
let's pray for the peace.

21:03.230 --> 21:04.730
Don't move.

21:06.570 --> 21:08.100
Looking for me?

21:08.520 --> 21:09.560
Kill.

21:09.590 --> 21:10.266
I don't know what...

21:10.290 --> 21:11.680
Don't move.

21:12.260 --> 21:13.600
Where is Kang?

21:13.620 --> 21:14.840
Listen to me.

21:15.260 --> 21:17.486
I am not the one,
who you are seeing...

21:17.510 --> 21:19.030
Where is Kang I-an?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.880
Who are you talking about?
I don't know.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.080
I will count to three.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.090
Who are you?

21:34.110 --> 21:35.110
One.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.910
I think I know you.

21:36.940 --> 21:38.280
Explain to me.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.576
How do you know me?

21:39.600 --> 21:40.630
Who are you?

21:40.650 --> 21:41.386
Two.

21:41.410 --> 21:42.186
Photo.

21:42.210 --> 21:43.520
I have a photo.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.566
I brought it from that car.

21:45.590 --> 21:46.796
I was inside it.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.586
Three.

21:47.610 --> 21:48.810
Wait.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.430
Wait.

21:50.470 --> 21:53.150
I really, really don't know anything.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.740
Tell me, where he is.

21:56.350 --> 21:57.390
Really.

22:08.190 --> 22:09.923
Oh... how did I do that...

22:11.330 --> 22:12.450
One moment.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.106
Relax.

22:14.130 --> 22:15.200
Calm down.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.320
This is

22:17.410 --> 22:18.410
you, right?

22:18.980 --> 22:20.810
What are you doing there?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.580
You know me, right?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.610
Who am I?

23:28.230 --> 23:28.976
What?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.280
What am I doi...

23:34.940 --> 23:36.580
What am I doing?

23:37.520 --> 23:39.970
Excuse me, I took the wrong seat.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.320
I have to go, I'm leaving.

23:42.350 --> 23:43.680
Wait.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.840
Then maybe

23:48.750 --> 23:49.990
you know her?

23:50.840 --> 23:52.850
No, I have no idea.

23:52.870 --> 23:56.790
Then who is that man,
who you met in the toilet?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.170
Where did he go?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.346
And who were those men in the warehouse?

24:01.370 --> 24:02.920
Go Joong-sa?

24:03.230 --> 24:03.996
Yes.

24:04.020 --> 24:04.906
Go Jongsma.

24:04.930 --> 24:06.290
Where is he?

24:07.600 --> 24:08.680
Yes.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.040
I think here.

24:10.270 --> 24:11.640
Yes.

24:12.740 --> 24:13.960
Here?

24:14.310 --> 24:16.910
Yes, he says to go to the second floor.

24:22.350 --> 24:24.440
I don't know, I'm scared.

24:24.770 --> 24:26.620
Ok bye, he is coming up.

24:26.650 --> 24:28.050
Are you here?

24:28.640 --> 24:30.066
You don't have to be here.

24:30.090 --> 24:31.610
What are you doing?

24:34.670 --> 24:36.306
We have already set up the scene.

24:36.330 --> 24:37.720
And the legend.

24:38.890 --> 24:40.796
Recently a woman pointed a gun at me.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.416
Short hair, about 167cm tall.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.136
Double eyelid, several moles on the left.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.086
In her 20's.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.986
You are talking about Moon Jin-ah?

24:47.010 --> 24:47.836
Moon Jin-ah?

24:47.860 --> 24:49.660
Moles on the left you said?

24:51.750 --> 24:52.980
Is it her?

24:54.190 --> 24:55.856
I think yes, Moon Jin-ah.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.246
What relationship do you have with her?

24:57.270 --> 24:58.310
Relationship?

25:00.520 --> 25:02.060
We didn't have any.

25:02.090 --> 25:03.090
Ah no.

25:03.150 --> 25:03.666
So.

25:03.690 --> 25:05.370
Do you know her address?

25:06.730 --> 25:08.070
One moment.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.136
Kahwedong district, 11,

25:18.160 --> 25:19.760
house 27.

25:19.780 --> 25:21.000
Apartment 102.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.000
One month passed already.

25:40.650 --> 25:42.870
Hey, who am I talking to?

25:44.490 --> 25:46.560
Kahwedong, 11, house 27...

25:46.580 --> 25:47.366
Ah?

25:47.390 --> 25:48.106
Kahwedong, 11...

25:48.130 --> 25:49.810
What's wrong with him?

25:51.460 --> 25:52.460
What is it?

25:52.730 --> 25:53.840
Are you ok?

26:02.080 --> 26:05.088
Kahwedong district, 11, house 27.
Apartment 102.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.210
NOAH MOOLSAN

26:47.160 --> 26:49.230
DELIVERY "NEW WORLD"

27:29.210 --> 27:31.580
Kahwedong, 11, house 27...

27:32.880 --> 27:34.760
11-27...

27:40.490 --> 27:43.010
Namyang highway, 37 minutes ago.

27:43.070 --> 27:44.076
What do you think,

27:44.100 --> 27:45.100
who is it?

27:45.940 --> 27:47.306
Manager Park Joon-Young, right?

27:47.330 --> 27:48.930
Is he really wanted?

27:49.870 --> 27:51.656
How long will you let it go?

27:51.680 --> 27:54.147
Till he leaks all inside information?

27:55.010 --> 27:56.230
I'm sorry.

27:56.830 --> 27:59.466
I will immediately
track his location and...

27:59.490 --> 28:00.930
Are you a parrot?!

28:01.010 --> 28:05.426
It is already a week that you
try to "immediately" track his location!

28:34.100 --> 28:35.990
What about Kang I-an?

28:36.040 --> 28:38.266
He was 48 hours late with his report.

28:38.290 --> 28:41.546
It's early yet to say, that he
is connected to manager Yoo.

28:41.570 --> 28:43.830
In this case not early.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.316
You will put yourself together,
when you will get fired?

28:47.340 --> 28:49.476
And the responsible is not coming.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.780
We need to gather them all.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.530
He is coming at last, dumbass.

29:05.650 --> 29:07.700
ID. Kang I-an.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.100
Kang I-an.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.376
Could you reach Kang I-an?

29:14.400 --> 29:16.066
He is the best agent in our team.

29:16.090 --> 29:18.290
You know, that this is difficult.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.040
Bride?

29:20.060 --> 29:22.727
Her phone was switched off the same day.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.800
First we reported her
missing to the police.

29:26.940 --> 29:30.332
But if the chief agrees,
I will start looking for her.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.450
After we catch manager Yoo.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.810
Don't rush.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.156
If the news will get to the
head office like the last time,

29:39.180 --> 29:41.650
we will all get problems.

29:44.400 --> 29:48.688
Manager Yoo, Moon Jin-ah and Kang I-an
disappeared at the same time.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.790
I think we should hurry.

29:53.260 --> 29:55.270
First find manager Yoo.

29:58.250 --> 29:59.400
Got it.

29:59.950 --> 30:04.942
Kang I-an, the girl from the church,
Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo,

30:05.410 --> 30:06.610
Noah Moolsan...

30:06.780 --> 30:08.670
Kang I-an

30:09.240 --> 30:11.950
Everybody knows Kang I-an.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.310
Kang I-an.

30:18.730 --> 30:19.840
Kang I-an...

32:14.250 --> 32:15.770
Where is Kang I-an?

32:37.450 --> 32:38.450
Hold on.

32:51.090 --> 32:52.770
Where are you leaving?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.310
Come with me.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.350
Calm down.

33:12.380 --> 33:13.810
Ah shit...

33:35.650 --> 33:37.090
You will get hurt.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.056
Where are you going?

33:52.080 --> 33:53.080
Shit.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.840
This car. Get in faster.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.280
Moon Jin-ah!

33:58.620 --> 33:59.740
Hurry, get in!

34:03.970 --> 34:05.100
Hold on.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.220
Manager Yoo!

34:11.510 --> 34:12.900
Fucking shithead!

34:19.680 --> 34:20.960
Where is I-an?

34:21.590 --> 34:22.690
Wait...

34:24.090 --> 34:25.680
Where is I-an?

34:26.430 --> 34:28.120
I want to know it too.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.776
When I came back that day,

34:30.800 --> 34:32.260
there was nobody.

34:32.290 --> 34:33.946
They are also looking for I-an.

34:33.970 --> 34:35.346
So have has to be alive.

34:35.370 --> 34:36.730
So that I-an...

34:36.760 --> 34:38.400
He is immobilized,

34:38.420 --> 34:39.946
so he has to be treated somewhere.

34:39.970 --> 34:40.970
Hold tight!

34:44.270 --> 34:44.956
Listen.

34:44.980 --> 34:45.956
It will be hard to understand.

34:45.980 --> 34:47.066
But listen to me.

34:47.090 --> 34:49.326
Something strange is happening to me.

34:49.350 --> 34:52.076
First, I'm not the person,
who you see now.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.936
I'm in a different body now.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.366
But the bodies always change.

34:55.390 --> 34:55.996
Twice a day.

34:56.020 --> 34:57.556
At midnight and midday.

34:57.580 --> 34:58.646
Always changing to someone different.

34:58.670 --> 35:00.166
What are you talking about?

35:00.190 --> 35:02.056
In the church today it was also me.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.106
You were threatening me with a gun.

35:04.130 --> 35:05.390
Who is real me?

35:05.420 --> 35:06.436
What is happening?

35:06.460 --> 35:08.036
I don't remember anything about it!

35:08.060 --> 35:10.850
I don't know, why this is happening!

35:10.880 --> 35:12.990
But I think, I am that man.

35:13.010 --> 35:14.310
That man?

35:14.330 --> 35:15.600
Kang I-an.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.746
Why did it all happen?

35:18.770 --> 35:20.256
Why that man knows me?

35:20.280 --> 35:22.813
And these people, who are they at all?

36:07.870 --> 36:09.120
God damn it!

36:19.650 --> 36:22.517
How did you know, that I was in the church?

36:23.230 --> 36:24.670
Because it was me!

36:25.360 --> 36:27.240
I think, I'm Kang I-an.

36:28.790 --> 36:30.390
What are you saying?

36:34.020 --> 36:36.120
You started all this.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.096
Hyundai, 3882!

36:37.120 --> 36:38.920
If I-an dies,

36:40.370 --> 36:42.190
I can kill you too.

36:44.580 --> 36:45.830
Wait!

36:47.680 --> 36:48.950
Wait!

36:49.540 --> 36:50.600
Hey you!

36:52.810 --> 36:53.426
Shit!

36:53.450 --> 36:54.560
Hey!

36:55.000 --> 36:56.656
I have no time at all.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.947
You have bit different statements.

37:00.540 --> 37:02.420
Do you see that car?

37:02.450 --> 37:04.850
I was driving from there...

37:05.820 --> 37:06.436
Ah...

37:06.460 --> 37:09.596
Ah, I will loose my mind,
what is it do you think?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.780
Don't move.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.530
Move and you're dead.

37:29.770 --> 37:31.036
Do you know Kang I-an?

37:31.060 --> 37:31.796
What?

37:31.820 --> 37:33.560
Tell me about him.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.176
Why is everyone looking for him?

37:35.200 --> 37:37.286
What are you trying to achieve now?

37:37.310 --> 37:39.176
I don't remember anything now.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.290
But I know, that 10mm deeper

37:41.510 --> 37:44.256
and there will be carotid artery
and then you will die.

37:44.280 --> 37:47.352
You know more about Kang I-an,
why do you ask me?

37:48.220 --> 37:49.290
5mm left.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.186
I'm doing only what I'm ordered.

37:51.210 --> 37:52.696
I'm told to catch, then I catch.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.356
To eliminate, then I eliminate.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.086
Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo,

37:56.110 --> 37:57.110
and me now.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.106
Who are these people?

37:58.130 --> 37:59.930
Why the fuck should I know?

38:00.600 --> 38:02.333
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

38:03.120 --> 38:04.446
The cop is coming.

38:04.470 --> 38:06.220
Police, there is police!

38:17.400 --> 38:19.096
When did you see Kang I-an?

38:19.120 --> 38:20.556
When did you see him last time?

38:20.580 --> 38:23.636
When he was escaping with the car
that had an accident.

38:23.660 --> 38:24.660
Don't lie!

38:24.920 --> 38:26.636
There was only man in that car!

38:26.660 --> 38:29.527
I really saw, how he drove off in that car!

38:30.380 --> 38:32.790
Kang I-an was also in that car?

38:51.800 --> 38:55.640
Till 8 o'clock you need to come
with the vehicle documents...

39:22.690 --> 39:26.410
Moon Jin-ah and manager Yoo
came here, however

39:27.260 --> 39:30.070
you just let them go, isn't it?

39:32.150 --> 39:34.910
Curious, what are your trying to achieve?

39:35.340 --> 39:36.520
Nothing.

39:37.150 --> 39:38.220
Nothing?

39:40.670 --> 39:42.090
What then?

39:42.570 --> 39:45.406
Tomorrow they will hand
over the merchandise.

39:45.430 --> 39:48.400
Till that time you
had to deal with everything.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.190
I have a bad feeling.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.947
Why Ji Cheol-ho lost his mind is not clear.

40:01.250 --> 40:05.110
I have no idea why I have
the gun of Kang I-an.

40:05.630 --> 40:07.563
Manager Yoo was strange also.

40:08.660 --> 40:11.260
Everyone around, one by one...

40:18.960 --> 40:20.010
Speak.

40:20.040 --> 40:22.340
As you said, she is here.

40:23.190 --> 40:24.670
What should I do?

40:25.270 --> 40:26.530
Bring her?

40:27.680 --> 40:30.020
Or just kill her right here?

40:30.250 --> 40:32.170
No, watch her,

40:32.430 --> 40:34.480
check where she will go.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.710
They found Moon Jin-ah.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.240
I handed it over to Jeongmo guys.

40:43.170 --> 40:45.410
I can't trust you.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.560
I'm leaving.

40:49.510 --> 40:50.870
Did you bring it?

40:50.990 --> 40:53.030
So what is it?

40:54.420 --> 40:57.556
They say, that Kang I-an is
involved in some scam.

40:58.730 --> 41:01.190
The mood in the office was just...

41:08.670 --> 41:11.050
At least drink some water first.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.346
List of people with
illegal medical practice.

41:19.370 --> 41:22.314
There are scammers among them
and real doctors.

41:22.860 --> 41:26.380
Some are treating foreigners in need.

41:29.030 --> 41:32.160
Security intelligence service Korea.
Jose Luis.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.310
Prakasi Latry.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.256
Prakasi Latry, 42 years old, Nepal...

41:44.280 --> 41:45.280
Listen,

41:45.470 --> 41:47.040
find him for me.

41:49.230 --> 41:50.340
Is it him?

41:51.550 --> 41:54.017
Are you sure, you
can manage it alone?

41:55.050 --> 41:56.330
I'm begging you.

41:57.940 --> 41:59.336
And give me a car.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.666
Then give me 10k won.

42:00.690 --> 42:04.030
What 10k, I sold you for one!

42:04.120 --> 42:07.700
The price to sell and to buy
is not the same!

42:07.730 --> 42:09.746
But I don't mind exchange rate fluctuation.

42:09.770 --> 42:10.346
Sir.

42:10.370 --> 42:11.246
What are you talking about?

42:11.270 --> 42:12.226
You scared me.

42:12.250 --> 42:13.450
Go, go!

42:13.470 --> 42:15.086
Excuse me, just a moment.

42:15.110 --> 42:16.946
Did you get the recorder
from that car in the morning?

42:16.970 --> 42:20.566
What bullshit are you talking about?
You look like dumbass!

42:20.590 --> 42:21.846
Shit, I'm leaving!

42:21.870 --> 42:22.686
Sir.

42:22.710 --> 42:24.336
I think, it's my car.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.176
I need to find out what happened.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.880
Where is the recorder?

42:28.270 --> 42:29.950
Sir, do you know me?!

42:30.160 --> 42:31.990
It's me, me, hotdog!

42:35.830 --> 42:38.940
Shit, it's something from the other world.

42:39.140 --> 42:42.300
I saw a lot of weird shit in my life

42:42.330 --> 42:45.340
but you know, I see
this for the first time.

42:45.950 --> 42:46.950
No, really.

42:47.610 --> 42:50.143
You are the only one of a kind, right?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.560
The soul leaves the body

42:52.680 --> 42:56.180
and enters other bodies!

42:57.090 --> 42:58.480
Isn't it?

42:59.030 --> 43:01.563
Then do they have something in common?

43:07.710 --> 43:09.650
So where is it? How far more?

43:41.700 --> 43:43.080
We are here.

43:43.520 --> 43:44.640
Right there.

43:47.860 --> 43:49.190
Hurry up!

43:51.450 --> 43:55.190
How come?
Today everyone lost their mind.

43:55.210 --> 43:56.176
Ah these people.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.200
Shit.

43:59.980 --> 44:00.980
Listen...

44:02.030 --> 44:03.096
I almost died, shit.

44:03.120 --> 44:03.896
Listen,

44:03.920 --> 44:06.276
give me back please
what I've sold you.

44:06.300 --> 44:07.416
That recorder.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.426
You are kidding, right?

44:08.450 --> 44:09.450
Beggar!

44:10.050 --> 44:10.706
Listen,

44:10.730 --> 44:11.776
I don't need the device.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.733
Just give me the memory card.

44:14.090 --> 44:16.420
Beggars, you stink, get lost!

44:16.520 --> 44:18.390
Or pay.

44:19.430 --> 44:20.870
Do you have money?

44:21.600 --> 44:23.280
What are you staring at?

44:33.820 --> 44:35.180
Card is ok?

44:36.870 --> 44:37.870
Yes.

44:38.770 --> 44:39.770
Speak.

44:42.310 --> 44:44.577
Check the place and send the boys.

44:49.190 --> 44:52.198
What an idiot to use a card
when you are wanted?

44:56.340 --> 44:57.390
Sir.

44:57.510 --> 44:59.820
These are memory cards,

44:59.840 --> 45:01.476
that we removed from recorders.

45:01.500 --> 45:02.776
But I don't know which one it is.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.480
You can take them all.

45:06.990 --> 45:08.286
Then can we check them here?

45:08.310 --> 45:09.866
You can do it in that room!

45:09.890 --> 45:10.516
Thank you.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.540
Yeah.

45:12.450 --> 45:14.626
According to recording,
the last person he contacted

45:14.650 --> 45:16.166
is Russian Dima.

45:16.190 --> 45:18.230
First find him.

45:27.070 --> 45:28.316
Have some coffee.

45:28.340 --> 45:29.026
Thank you.

45:29.050 --> 45:30.050
Yes.

46:08.580 --> 46:09.580
Oh!

46:10.670 --> 46:11.670
What?

46:11.950 --> 46:13.310
I think, I found.

46:19.700 --> 46:20.770
Gun! Gun!

46:30.090 --> 46:31.120
What is it?

46:33.540 --> 46:35.110
I think it's him.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.200
Him?

46:37.470 --> 46:38.720
It is me.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.160
Where is he heading to?

46:45.780 --> 46:47.200
Will see now.

46:47.430 --> 46:48.660
Uh.

46:48.730 --> 46:50.356
We are closed already.

46:50.380 --> 46:51.420
Come tomorrow

47:03.790 --> 47:05.920
You are Yoo Joon-Young?

47:06.030 --> 47:07.130
They are...

47:07.360 --> 47:08.800
What should we do?

47:09.280 --> 47:10.490
Come here.

47:11.260 --> 47:12.260
Sir.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.060
Run!

47:34.830 --> 47:36.650
You go that way.

48:08.990 --> 48:09.356
Let me go!

48:09.380 --> 48:10.380
Sir!

48:11.150 --> 48:12.360
Shit!

48:22.950 --> 48:23.960
Sir!

48:34.150 --> 48:35.570
Let go, shithead!

48:41.890 --> 48:42.890
Hey!

48:43.370 --> 48:44.890
You lost your mind?

48:50.450 --> 48:51.460
Sorry.

48:52.620 --> 48:53.620
What the...

48:59.210 --> 49:00.036
Who are you?

49:00.060 --> 49:01.060
Let me go!

49:02.110 --> 49:04.910
It's on the right side.
What are you doing?

49:44.720 --> 49:46.240
Yes, director Park.

49:47.700 --> 49:49.176
Moon Jin-ah is in the black car.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.800
We are following it.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.733
We are leaving north Hannam bridge.

49:54.770 --> 49:55.770
Yes.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.560
What?

49:58.340 --> 49:59.340
Understood.

49:59.620 --> 50:01.620
We will immediately bring her.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.100
Yes.

50:11.730 --> 50:12.800
Understood.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.240
Hey.

50:29.330 --> 50:30.410
Who are you?

50:38.550 --> 50:39.740
Shit...

51:36.720 --> 51:39.728
Not everything in life
goes the way you want it?

51:41.910 --> 51:43.280
Same for me.

51:44.340 --> 51:45.540
Because of you.

51:45.810 --> 51:47.490
Where were you hiding?

51:47.710 --> 51:49.610
How did you find me?

51:51.340 --> 51:53.010
NOAH MOOLSAN

51:55.870 --> 51:57.210
Noah Moolsan?

51:59.230 --> 52:00.350
Noah Moolsan?

52:06.480 --> 52:09.410
Noah Moolsan...

52:17.450 --> 52:19.130
Why empty handed?

52:19.430 --> 52:20.470
Hmm...

52:20.690 --> 52:25.260
You were looking for Moon Jin-ah
and Kang I-an, why are you here?

52:25.960 --> 52:27.400
And where is Park?

52:29.010 --> 52:30.180
He will...

52:30.810 --> 52:31.810
come soon.

52:32.150 --> 52:33.883
Together with Moon Jin-ah.

52:36.470 --> 52:37.830
Come here.

52:47.910 --> 52:51.302
Why are you hiding your eyes,
when I'm talking to you?

52:52.720 --> 52:53.790
Sorry.

53:00.660 --> 53:02.050
Excuse me...

53:03.890 --> 53:05.240
This man...

53:05.270 --> 53:06.270
Who are you?

53:06.990 --> 53:08.700
They were together.

53:08.950 --> 53:10.600
Beggar, I think.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.770
He lost his mind.

53:14.210 --> 53:15.410
Get rid of him.

53:15.900 --> 53:17.400
Why get rid...

53:17.600 --> 53:18.156
I

53:18.180 --> 53:18.726
How could you...

53:18.750 --> 53:19.446
will get rid of him.

53:19.470 --> 53:21.046
do this to a person...

53:21.070 --> 53:22.090
Help!

53:22.320 --> 53:23.510
Mercy!

53:23.640 --> 53:24.546
Mercy!

53:24.570 --> 53:25.570
Get out!

53:26.330 --> 53:27.350
Get out!

53:29.340 --> 53:30.640
Help!

53:31.620 --> 53:33.190
Get out you idiot!

53:33.220 --> 53:34.146
You are done!

53:34.170 --> 53:34.906
I need to go...

53:34.930 --> 53:35.940
Get out!

53:35.960 --> 53:36.676
No!

53:36.700 --> 53:37.950
Quiet, please!

53:38.530 --> 53:40.780
This man has changed the body!

53:40.800 --> 53:42.066
He said, he wants to find himself!

53:42.090 --> 53:43.370
On the recorder!

53:43.400 --> 53:44.056
Sir!

53:44.080 --> 53:45.080
Hey!

53:46.740 --> 53:48.670
I told you...

53:50.240 --> 53:52.100
Shut up, beggar!

53:52.320 --> 53:54.526
Do you know something about Noah Moolsan?

53:54.550 --> 53:56.020
Maybe I know it.

53:56.050 --> 53:57.520
Sure, I know it.

53:58.290 --> 53:59.640
I don't know.

54:00.510 --> 54:02.190
You are a bit strange.

54:04.640 --> 54:06.240
Your way of speaking

54:06.530 --> 54:07.426
is really strange.

54:07.450 --> 54:08.970
As if it's not you.

54:11.640 --> 54:14.150
Why is it so many freaks lately?

54:15.300 --> 54:16.980
Right.

54:17.730 --> 54:19.540
Park was right.

54:19.990 --> 54:22.790
He said, something similar happened to me.

54:22.940 --> 54:24.730
And that time

54:26.870 --> 54:30.910
I looked really like you?

54:46.060 --> 54:47.670
What is her name?

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
Come on.

54:49.860 --> 54:52.770
If you don't remember,
then don't tell.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.860
Soon-Young, what is it?

55:03.900 --> 55:05.630
We had a business here.

55:10.300 --> 55:11.400
Soon-Young.

55:11.890 --> 55:12.960
Soon-Young?

55:16.880 --> 55:19.370
She feels offended now probably.

55:20.150 --> 55:24.000
That you don't even remember
the name of your girlfriend.

55:31.460 --> 55:33.060
Strange.

55:33.090 --> 55:34.560
Very.

55:37.070 --> 55:39.270
But my name is really Soon-Young.

55:40.120 --> 55:42.150
I am Hwang Soon-Young.

55:50.810 --> 55:53.710
Chief will come tomorrow,
now leave the place.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.086
Do you get, what I'm talking about?

55:56.110 --> 55:57.110
Yes.

56:06.650 --> 56:07.650
Let's go.

56:08.350 --> 56:09.350
let's go!

56:16.100 --> 56:18.440
Where are you and what are doing?

56:19.400 --> 56:20.580
Sorry.

56:20.780 --> 56:22.460
There was an accident.

56:23.090 --> 56:24.350
What accident?

56:25.680 --> 56:27.580
I will tell everything...

56:28.560 --> 56:30.620
This crazy...

56:34.450 --> 56:35.750
Listen...

56:36.590 --> 56:39.160
He is really crazy...

56:39.180 --> 56:41.260
His body is always changing!

56:41.280 --> 56:42.960
Sir! It's me, hotdog.

56:43.740 --> 56:45.060
You know me.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.990
I'm loosing my mind.

56:48.550 --> 56:51.040
Why are you doing this to me?!

57:10.540 --> 57:11.890
He said,

57:11.910 --> 57:13.360
that Ko Joon-sa

57:14.710 --> 57:16.230
and you are losers.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.590
Dima?

57:58.360 --> 57:59.790
Did you see him?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.500
I have no idea.
I don't speak Korean.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.600
<i>National Intelligence Service.</i>
Passport.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.133
I have no time to deal with you.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.800
But if you want,

58:16.000 --> 58:17.800
I can investigate you.

58:21.190 --> 58:24.930
I heard it is somewhere in Namyangju.

58:25.180 --> 58:28.340
Maybe at some factory.

58:35.610 --> 58:37.130
Where is Kang I-an?

58:37.720 --> 58:39.180
Kang I-an...

58:42.280 --> 58:45.040
I don't know, where he is.

58:45.060 --> 58:46.670
So it is better.

58:47.090 --> 58:49.790
When I escaped,

58:49.820 --> 58:52.030
I decided to come and check,

58:52.750 --> 58:54.350
and he was there.

58:54.860 --> 58:57.320
So and where it that "there"?!

58:57.340 --> 58:58.900
Where?!

58:58.920 --> 58:59.920
Well...

59:05.590 --> 59:07.200
Curious?

59:07.250 --> 59:08.250
Yes.

59:09.910 --> 59:12.510
Kang I-an is my friend.

59:13.540 --> 59:15.950
I know, where he is.

59:16.790 --> 59:18.910
But I will not tell you.

59:20.130 --> 59:22.640
Fucking junkie.

59:30.220 --> 59:33.050
How long will you keep looking?

59:33.070 --> 59:34.730
It is broken.

59:35.750 --> 59:36.836
This is the end.

59:36.860 --> 59:38.396
It's past midnight already.

59:38.420 --> 59:40.136
And the moon is on the right side.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.500
The car is heading south-east.

59:42.950 --> 59:45.200
Highway 66.

59:45.610 --> 59:48.150
Heading south-east on the highway 66.

59:48.180 --> 59:50.270
How do you know all this?

59:51.160 --> 59:54.580
Even if it is so, we can not
search all the highway.

59:56.980 --> 59:58.350
Highway 66?

59:58.920 --> 59:59.920
One moment.

1:00:02.850 --> 1:00:04.860
I think I know, where it is.

1:00:06.290 --> 1:00:07.206
Hi.

1:00:07.230 --> 1:00:08.926
Can you send me the location?

1:00:08.950 --> 1:00:11.816
I'm searching, but I didn't
find the exact location yet.

1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:13.630
I'm trying, wait.

1:00:17.820 --> 1:00:19.500
Pyeongnae-dong, 34-7.

1:00:26.260 --> 1:00:28.790
Namyangju, Pyeongnae-dong, 34-7.

1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:53.160
Yes, Soon-Jin.

1:00:53.570 --> 1:00:54.696
Did you find out?

1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:57.750
Yes. In Ulsan. Namyangju, Pyeongnae-dong

1:00:57.770 --> 1:00:58.960
Namyangju?

1:00:58.980 --> 1:00:59.980
Yes.

1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:01.990
Ok, got it, Thank you.

1:01:02.780 --> 1:01:05.920
You were on the highway
from Namyangju, right?

1:01:05.950 --> 1:01:06.950
Sure?

1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:10.980
Namyangju...

1:01:11.220 --> 1:01:13.140
Namyangju...

1:01:15.690 --> 1:01:16.446
There is...

1:01:16.470 --> 1:01:20.880
a factory in Namyangju, that our
agents used before as a safe house.

1:01:20.910 --> 1:01:21.910
Yes?

1:01:22.340 --> 1:01:25.136
There was also the
doctor from Nepal, right?

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:26.440
Right, isn't it?

1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:30.270
Right.

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:38.436
What do you need?

1:02:38.460 --> 1:02:39.460
Excuse me.

1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:43.346
On 12th in the night you were
treating a man, who was driving Korando.

1:02:43.370 --> 1:02:44.970
Don't know anything.

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:46.080
Move away.

1:02:54.430 --> 1:02:57.010
NOAH MOOLSAN

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:05.500
Who are you?

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.476
What are you doing here?

1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:10.000
Get out of here!

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.126
Wait, wait. You didn't get it?
Get out of here!

1:03:13.150 --> 1:03:14.880
Yes, yes, thank you...

1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:16.880
So loud...

1:03:48.450 --> 1:03:50.300
I think it's not here.

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:52.970
Maybe you got it wrong?

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:55.160
It is definitely here.

1:03:56.570 --> 1:03:57.790
I can feel it.

1:06:11.260 --> 1:06:12.500
Is it him?

1:06:14.930 --> 1:06:15.930
Yes.

1:06:17.110 --> 1:06:18.590
I found my body.

1:06:38.670 --> 1:06:40.706
We go in immediately when it's surrounded.

1:06:40.730 --> 1:06:42.410
Wait for the order.

1:06:42.580 --> 1:06:44.580
I have a bad feeling about it.

1:06:44.730 --> 1:06:45.776
It will be fun.

1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:47.160
Let's get inside.

1:06:53.750 --> 1:06:55.116
Check if merchandise is there.

1:06:55.140 --> 1:06:56.736
Put a cordon outside.

1:06:56.760 --> 1:06:58.440
Search the area around.

1:06:59.090 --> 1:07:02.160
End of operation: 5:27.

1:07:02.230 --> 1:07:03.730
Let's count.

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:05.760
Name of deceased: Jae I-myung.

1:07:08.710 --> 1:07:12.422
Lost merchandise - new drug
from Thailand called "Eterecs".

1:07:12.510 --> 1:07:13.706
Unlike other drugs

1:07:13.730 --> 1:07:16.126
this one places you in
a near death state of mind,

1:07:16.150 --> 1:07:17.746
like you are separated from your body.

1:07:17.770 --> 1:07:19.956
Small capsules are getting
in blood stream

1:07:19.980 --> 1:07:21.750
and rupture every 12 hours

1:07:21.770 --> 1:07:23.706
keeping hallucinations in effect.

1:07:23.730 --> 1:07:26.716
Due to high strength of the drug
there are many side effects.

1:07:26.740 --> 1:07:30.166
Common are hearing hallucinations
and some physical symptoms.

1:07:30.190 --> 1:07:31.550
In worst case

1:07:31.570 --> 1:07:34.700
you loose memory and then die.

1:07:35.140 --> 1:07:38.870
Lost merchandise weighs 3570kg
and costs 25 billion won.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.476
If it will hit the market, it's the end.

1:07:40.500 --> 1:07:43.033
I need to talk. Come out for a moment.

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:44.200
Kang I-an!

1:07:44.310 --> 1:07:45.310
Yes.

1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:47.966
You still didn't find the
location of Yoo Joon-Youngа?

1:07:47.990 --> 1:07:49.300
No, not yet.

1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:52.076
He is definitely connected
to the events today.

1:07:52.100 --> 1:07:55.396
If you will get any info about him
immediately report to me.

1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:57.220
Report about all movements.

1:07:58.290 --> 1:08:01.490
How many times did we find
bodies instead of drugs?

1:08:01.630 --> 1:08:03.456
If we will not deal with it,

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.976
we will have to ask for
help from the police.

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.546
Let's not disgrace ourselves.

1:08:07.570 --> 1:08:08.610
Yeah.

1:08:09.090 --> 1:08:11.490
Where were you hiding all this time?

1:08:11.730 --> 1:08:13.997
Some place here, some place there.

1:08:19.050 --> 1:08:21.190
Why do you have my lighter?

1:08:22.250 --> 1:08:24.310
Why was it at the crime scene?

1:08:24.390 --> 1:08:25.876
Inside the organization

1:08:25.900 --> 1:08:28.166
there are some, who kill the
drug dealers and lay their hands on drugs.

1:08:28.190 --> 1:08:30.606
Is it not because you leaked the information?

1:08:30.630 --> 1:08:32.360
They forged the evidence.

1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:33.856
I investigated that,

1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:35.766
that's why they pinned that to me

1:08:35.790 --> 1:08:36.596
and they are looking for me now.

1:08:36.620 --> 1:08:37.870
Cut the crap.

1:08:38.030 --> 1:08:39.390
Turn yourself in.

1:08:42.020 --> 1:08:43.540
Get your hand out.

1:08:43.780 --> 1:08:44.940
Trust me.

1:08:46.350 --> 1:08:48.150
Get your hand out, I said!

1:08:54.250 --> 1:08:55.430
Check it.

1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:02.160
Did you call Park?

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:03.696
I said, you are turning yourself in.

1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:04.970
Do not resist.

1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:11.540
Make sure to check it.

1:09:26.570 --> 1:09:27.720
It's cold.

1:09:28.070 --> 1:09:29.510
Did you wait long?

1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:32.353
Sorry, I had some urgent things to do.

1:09:32.610 --> 1:09:34.366
So if I'm here,
should I come in and confess?

1:09:34.390 --> 1:09:36.160
Confess what?

1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:37.910
Confess at home.

1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:42.540
Seoul has a great night view.

1:09:43.110 --> 1:09:44.350
Yes, indeed.

1:09:50.210 --> 1:09:51.280
What is it?

1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:52.740
What happened?

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:55.930
Joon-Young...

1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:57.870
Manager Yoo?

1:09:58.120 --> 1:09:59.210
Yes.

1:09:59.770 --> 1:10:02.996
He is wanted since last week,
he leaked all inside information.

1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:04.020
What?

1:10:04.430 --> 1:10:07.316
I've though a lot about it,
but I reported him.

1:10:07.340 --> 1:10:08.860
Not a nice feeling.

1:10:08.900 --> 1:10:10.260
So that's why

1:10:10.930 --> 1:10:12.560
you were so down?

1:10:15.410 --> 1:10:16.436
And what to do now?

1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:18.993
Call from head office.
Probably urgent.

1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:20.740
Let's talk at home.

1:10:28.170 --> 1:10:30.446
They say some cops lay
their hands on drugs.

1:10:30.470 --> 1:10:31.106
Are you them?

1:10:31.130 --> 1:10:31.526
Yes.

1:10:31.550 --> 1:10:32.990
We are those cops.

1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:35.730
Leave what you have and get off.

1:10:37.370 --> 1:10:38.790
Nothing to say?

1:10:38.820 --> 1:10:41.620
If you leave quietly,
nobody will get hurt.

1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:44.450
It's your choice.

1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:46.016
Hey, shit!

1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:46.956
What the...?

1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:48.436
Where are you going? What is it?

1:10:48.460 --> 1:10:49.760
Jin-ah.

1:10:49.790 --> 1:10:50.790
Who are you?

1:10:51.030 --> 1:10:51.916
Hey!

1:10:51.940 --> 1:10:52.940
Shit!

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:56.570
Where are you?

1:10:57.460 --> 1:10:58.900
And where are you?

1:11:00.150 --> 1:11:01.240
Chief Park?

1:11:10.550 --> 1:11:11.356
Jin-ah!

1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:12.106
I-an!

1:11:12.130 --> 1:11:13.130
Jin-ah!

1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:14.860
Jin-ah!

1:11:15.710 --> 1:11:16.616
I-an!

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:17.640
Stop it.

1:11:24.010 --> 1:11:25.100
Jin-ah!

1:11:29.110 --> 1:11:30.790
He must be calmed down.

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:38.020
I-an!

1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:38.736
I-an!

1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.416
I will kill you, bastards!

1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:41.910
I-an!

1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:43.160
I-an!

1:11:48.460 --> 1:11:50.290
No!

1:11:53.190 --> 1:11:54.086
Stop!

1:11:54.110 --> 1:11:55.580
No! No!

1:12:09.330 --> 1:12:10.730
I-an...

1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:28.350
I-an!

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:30.890
I-an!

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:32.976
No!

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.490
That's Eterecs.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.467
You can't buy a dose for your salary.

1:12:38.010 --> 1:12:40.677
How do you find "near death experience"?

1:12:41.310 --> 1:12:43.240
Why are you doing this...

1:12:43.930 --> 1:12:45.150
Lost your mind?

1:12:46.350 --> 1:12:47.440
Where is it?

1:13:09.310 --> 1:13:11.710
Why did you get involved in this?

1:13:13.690 --> 1:13:14.690
Ah!

1:13:15.050 --> 1:13:16.260
No, no.

1:13:17.550 --> 1:13:19.410
You started it right?

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.470
You killed these two.

1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:26.700
And killed yourself.

1:13:27.630 --> 1:13:29.140
Good story?

1:13:29.890 --> 1:13:31.590
And the scene...

1:13:32.210 --> 1:13:33.890
Think of it yourself.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:37.160
Jin-ah...

1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:40.760
I-an...

1:13:44.550 --> 1:13:45.550
I-an...

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:52.620
I-an!

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:53.640
Jin-ah!

1:13:55.990 --> 1:13:57.130
I-an!

1:14:37.110 --> 1:14:38.520
Jin-ah...

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.660
Jin-ah...

1:14:58.290 --> 1:14:59.310
I-an...

1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:01.510
I love you...

1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:48.460
Jin-ah! Are you ok?

1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:52.780
I-an!

1:15:53.230 --> 1:15:54.046
Jin-ah!

1:15:54.070 --> 1:15:55.260
What is it?

1:16:32.390 --> 1:16:33.670
This...

1:16:34.890 --> 1:16:36.180
What is it?

1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:39.030
Jin-ah!

1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:44.280
Let go!

1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:45.520
I-an!

1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:47.220
No time!

1:16:48.930 --> 1:16:50.220
Hey, hey, hey!

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:07.460
Latry!

1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:16.116
How is that?!

1:18:16.140 --> 1:18:17.056
Hey, guys!

1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:18.320
Help! Hurry!

1:18:18.710 --> 1:18:19.486
Hurry!

1:18:19.510 --> 1:18:20.510
Hurry!

1:18:42.820 --> 1:18:44.200
Jin-ah...

1:19:00.890 --> 1:19:01.890
Found.

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:03.853
Adjacent building, 4th floor.

1:19:05.330 --> 1:19:07.010
What are you doing here?

1:19:09.350 --> 1:19:10.870
What are you doing?

1:19:12.630 --> 1:19:14.230
I was thinking,

1:19:15.860 --> 1:19:18.200
what really happened to me.

1:19:18.360 --> 1:19:19.360
What?

1:19:25.090 --> 1:19:26.830
And I figured out,

1:19:28.010 --> 1:19:29.840
what I have to do now.

1:19:38.910 --> 1:19:41.286
You asked, what do they have in common?

1:19:41.310 --> 1:19:42.360
Me?

1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:44.510
They were there that day.

1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:47.690
I'm transferring into them.

1:19:47.710 --> 1:19:48.516
So..

1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:50.340
...you remember everything?

1:19:51.130 --> 1:19:51.766
Jin-ah

1:19:51.790 --> 1:19:54.416
I-an, where are you? Call me.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid. Call me.

1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:55.830
What should I do?

1:19:56.010 --> 1:19:59.020
We are surrounded outside
by guys with guns!

1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:00.916
They are here because of you?

1:20:00.940 --> 1:20:01.566
Me?

1:20:01.590 --> 1:20:03.570
I?..Me?..

1:20:03.790 --> 1:20:04.960
Leave, hurry.

1:20:05.380 --> 1:20:06.656
I don't need a massacre here!

1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:08.470
Get out of here now!

1:20:29.900 --> 1:20:30.960
Listen.

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:32.280
Sorry,

1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:34.420
but take care of this.

1:20:35.020 --> 1:20:37.087
Take care... take care of what?

1:20:51.780 --> 1:20:53.980
Is it her Park was talking about?

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:19.530
Chief?

1:22:19.980 --> 1:22:21.190
Are you ok?

1:22:21.630 --> 1:22:23.563
There are armed people there!

1:22:23.670 --> 1:22:24.890
It seems...

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:26.736
I-An is also somewhere near.

1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:27.910
Got it.

1:22:28.110 --> 1:22:29.530
Wait in the car.

1:22:42.670 --> 1:22:43.670
Chief Lee!

1:22:58.720 --> 1:22:59.730
Chief!

1:22:59.750 --> 1:23:00.870
I don't...

1:23:00.890 --> 1:23:02.570
What are you going to do?

1:23:04.430 --> 1:23:06.697
Do you know how much is that deal?

1:23:06.790 --> 1:23:08.923
Do you want to spoil everything?

1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:15.730
Chief Lee...

1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:22.176
The police will arrive soon,
so let's finish fast.

1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:23.700
No!

1:23:48.310 --> 1:23:49.440
What the...?

1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:50.640
Drive!

1:23:53.750 --> 1:23:54.770
Get out!

1:23:57.960 --> 1:23:59.090
Stop!

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:04.220
Flight 8700...

1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:30.210
Still taking drugs?

1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:34.480
No peace with you, not at all!

1:24:36.210 --> 1:24:39.010
How many did you kill already,
God damn it?

1:24:40.420 --> 1:24:44.520
I told you, not to handle
Kang I-an like that.

1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:50.807
You wanted so much to do it your way?

1:24:50.910 --> 1:24:53.160
Hired some junkie.

1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:54.826
You want to get my place?

1:24:54.850 --> 1:24:56.106
I will deal with everything.

1:24:56.130 --> 1:24:58.376
I've dealt with everything till now.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:24:59.756
I caught Moon Jin-ah.

1:24:59.780 --> 1:25:01.046
And manager Yoo.

1:25:01.070 --> 1:25:03.330
And later...
caught Kang I-an too.

1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:06.046
Ah, no, didn't catch yet...
but soon I will!

1:25:06.070 --> 1:25:07.750
Do I need something else?

1:25:08.190 --> 1:25:09.190
Ah?

1:25:09.460 --> 1:25:10.956
What are you so afraid of,

1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:13.113
why are you screwing me, shit...

1:25:25.650 --> 1:25:28.416
You saw her in the church,
why did you let her go?

1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:29.440
Ah?

1:25:29.980 --> 1:25:31.680
What are you going to do?

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:35.790
Ou-ou.

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:39.440
You we sent again to follow me?

1:25:39.980 --> 1:25:42.490
It seems so. And you are so busy.

1:25:42.570 --> 1:25:44.680
Hey, did we meet in the church?

1:25:47.370 --> 1:25:48.870
She said no.

1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:57.670
You are always the good one.

1:25:58.060 --> 1:25:59.060
Ah?

1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:00.456
You picked me first,

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:02.160
said, I was brilliant.

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:05.216
What?

1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:06.600
What again? What?

1:26:07.300 --> 1:26:08.300
Ah?

1:26:08.660 --> 1:26:09.426
Ah you shithead...

1:26:09.450 --> 1:26:11.130
What are you staring at?

1:26:42.810 --> 1:26:44.060
Joon-Young!

1:26:44.650 --> 1:26:45.650
Joon-Young!

1:26:46.110 --> 1:26:47.200
Joon-Young!

1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:48.680
Joon-Young...

1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:21.413
They all were there that day.

1:27:22.610 --> 1:27:24.410
I'm transferring into them.

1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:35.430
Park, get up!

1:27:35.450 --> 1:27:36.560
Wake up!

1:27:41.490 --> 1:27:42.576
What are you doing?

1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:43.970
Calm down.

1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:46.200
We must get out of here.

1:28:12.830 --> 1:28:14.280
Ah, shit!

1:30:32.940 --> 1:30:35.110
It's you, chief Chung!

1:30:45.430 --> 1:30:46.930
Who are you?

1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:49.470
What about Lee?

1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:50.760
Well,

1:30:51.130 --> 1:30:52.140
he is sick.

1:30:52.170 --> 1:30:53.430
Getting rest.

1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:54.550
Getting rest?

1:30:54.790 --> 1:30:56.580
He is strange lately.

1:30:56.670 --> 1:30:58.706
Well, it always like this with people.

1:30:58.730 --> 1:31:00.350
They are strange.

1:31:16.910 --> 1:31:17.910
Enough?

1:31:19.250 --> 1:31:20.930
Bring the merchandise.

1:31:21.210 --> 1:31:22.210
Yes.

1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:27.366
You said, you tested it?

1:31:27.390 --> 1:31:28.390
Of course.

1:31:28.710 --> 1:31:30.300
Thoroughly tested.

1:31:59.430 --> 1:32:01.000
Park, what is it?

1:32:03.700 --> 1:32:05.170
Where is Jin-ah?

1:32:05.710 --> 1:32:07.070
You motherfucker!

1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:12.036
What was it?

1:32:12.060 --> 1:32:13.860
Hey, what is that gunshot?

1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:23.856
Check it.

1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:24.826
What's wrong?

1:32:24.850 --> 1:32:25.996
You want to set me up?

1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:28.110
No, not really!

1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:45.550
This is Park.

1:32:45.860 --> 1:32:47.040
Park?

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:48.316
Hey!

1:32:48.340 --> 1:32:49.986
He is not working for you?

1:32:50.010 --> 1:32:51.066
That bustard...

1:32:51.090 --> 1:32:52.176
What are you waiting for?

1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:53.200
Kill him.

1:32:55.810 --> 1:32:56.706
Bastard.

1:32:56.730 --> 1:32:58.650
Rat! Sitting here.

1:32:59.290 --> 1:33:00.660
Move!

1:33:00.980 --> 1:33:02.620
Fucking looser!

1:33:03.420 --> 1:33:05.690
Made some shit behind my back?

1:33:07.130 --> 1:33:10.202
You piss me off.
Can't even clean it up, idiot...

1:33:12.570 --> 1:33:14.250
What are you staring at!

1:33:15.650 --> 1:33:17.580
Be quiet.

1:33:17.690 --> 1:33:20.350
I can't concentrate!

1:33:28.290 --> 1:33:31.510
What do you want from me,
fucking idiots?

1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:33.430
Ah?

1:33:44.730 --> 1:33:46.020
He is nuts.

1:33:46.510 --> 1:33:48.716
If you stayed alive,
you better run away.

1:33:48.740 --> 1:33:50.856
Did you come here to make a mess?

1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:51.880
Ah?

1:34:00.900 --> 1:34:01.900
Ah?

1:34:36.710 --> 1:34:37.750
What is that?

1:34:37.910 --> 1:34:39.270
Why are you here?

1:34:39.690 --> 1:34:40.690
Come here.

1:34:41.260 --> 1:34:43.660
There is something interesting here.

1:35:42.610 --> 1:35:43.810
Where is Jin-ah

1:35:44.750 --> 1:35:46.800
Where is Jin-ah?!

1:36:00.790 --> 1:36:02.470
Have you lost your mind?

1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:11.200
Hey!

1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:14.127
How do you want to deal with that?

1:36:14.820 --> 1:36:16.753
You got your revenge already.

1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:18.660
Stop it.

1:36:30.290 --> 1:36:31.580
You are Park?

1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:34.840
Not Park, right?

1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:44.100
Drop the gun and come out.

1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:47.380
If you don't want her
to die come out!

1:36:49.230 --> 1:36:50.430
Won't come out?

1:36:50.700 --> 1:36:52.060
I will shoot her.

1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:53.520
Ah?

1:36:53.750 --> 1:36:55.470
You don't care, right?

1:36:56.460 --> 1:36:57.610
I will shoot.

1:37:01.580 --> 1:37:02.680
Don't do it.

1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:05.510
Ok?

1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:13.600
Don't torture her anymore.

1:37:17.110 --> 1:37:18.110
You,

1:37:20.090 --> 1:37:21.340
who are you?

1:37:24.870 --> 1:37:26.710
And how do you think?

1:37:31.300 --> 1:37:32.300
You?

1:37:33.330 --> 1:37:34.330
You...

1:37:36.190 --> 1:37:37.530
You...

1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:41.360
Don't know, it's hard.

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:13.266
Kang I-an?

1:38:13.290 --> 1:38:14.156
Park?

1:38:14.180 --> 1:38:15.913
Are you a ghost, shithead?

1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.350
Ghost, right?

1:38:40.630 --> 1:38:41.790
Ah, ghost?

1:38:41.990 --> 1:38:43.430
Now I got it.

1:39:17.100 --> 1:39:19.367
Ghost or whatever it is you are...

1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:21.367
The main thing is the story.

1:39:33.510 --> 1:39:37.490
The story now will be

1:39:38.180 --> 1:39:39.860
that you lost your mind,

1:39:40.430 --> 1:39:42.490
took drugs and assaulted me.

1:39:48.660 --> 1:39:50.410
Are you kidding?

1:39:50.740 --> 1:39:52.020
Playing with me?

1:39:55.850 --> 1:39:57.140
Fuck...

1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:33.290
I-an?

1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:43.900
I-an, right?

1:40:48.270 --> 1:40:50.230
Did you wait long?

1:40:54.380 --> 1:40:55.870
Sorry.

1:40:59.850 --> 1:41:02.150
I had an urgent business.

1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:21.620
I have to

1:41:21.790 --> 1:41:23.390
confess...

1:41:35.100 --> 1:41:36.200
I-an!

1:41:36.610 --> 1:41:37.610
Wait...

1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:39.500
Wait!

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:44.070
I-an!

1:41:54.450 --> 1:41:55.790
I-an!

1:41:58.490 --> 1:41:59.700
I-an!

1:42:05.820 --> 1:42:07.530
I-an!

1:42:31.210 --> 1:42:32.490
USB flash stick

1:42:33.030 --> 1:42:37.360
we gave to specialists of KAIST,
but small chance to recover.

1:42:37.990 --> 1:42:41.382
And it is not clear,
when Kang I-an will be conscious.

1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.240
But I want to ask you.

1:42:47.990 --> 1:42:48.990
Here.

1:42:50.710 --> 1:42:52.540
Why all of them

1:42:52.570 --> 1:42:55.240
were so eager to save you?

1:42:55.690 --> 1:42:57.550
I just can't understand it.

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:01.240
It is not them.

1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:09.750
It is one man.

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:51.100
SPIRITWALKER
