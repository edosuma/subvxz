00:18.607 --> 00:20.962
Now, look, Hans, I want you to
be careful taking it out.

00:21.007 --> 00:23.680
Yeah. He's a big bastard,
I'll give you that.

00:23.727 --> 00:26.241
Maybe I can break him down,
cut him down to size.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.243
If you want, I could get the axe.

00:28.287 --> 00:29.242
The axe?!

00:29.287 --> 00:31.847
Just a hand axe, Mark,
not a felling axe.

00:31.887 --> 00:33.320
No, Hans, no axes.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.323
I can help for a little sweetener,
a fiver?

00:35.367 --> 00:39.360
A fee? I suppose you never really
sat on that sofa much, did you?

00:39.407 --> 00:41.204
Maybe just for about 100,000 hours.

00:41.247 --> 00:43.442
And I suppose you won't sit on the
new sofa much, either.

00:43.487 --> 00:44.761
I just need money, Mark.

00:44.807 --> 00:47.037
Yes, well, I don't want to pay you
for domestic chores.

00:47.087 --> 00:49.317
That's why I'm abusing
my management position

00:49.367 --> 00:51.005
to get you challenging work at JLB.

00:51.047 --> 00:52.526
I don't need to be challenged, Mark,

00:52.567 --> 00:55.559
I just need something to do
in the mornings. Some purpose.

00:55.607 --> 00:57.962
I'm tired of staring
at my own winkle all day.

00:58.007 --> 00:59.918
And careful bringing the new one in.

00:59.967 --> 01:03.084
Chipped paintwork and abrasion to the
upholstery will result in deductions.

01:03.127 --> 01:04.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04.327 --> 01:06.158
Terms and conditions apply.

anal discharge etc.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.837
<i>You can't fuck a sofa, mate.</i>
<i>Take it from me.</i>

01:13.887 --> 01:14.922
This suit.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.925
It's sapping my vibe, my powers.
I can't think right.

01:17.967 --> 01:20.162
Yeah, well,
why don't you get another job?

01:20.207 --> 01:22.960
You could explore that
opening at the giant beanstalk,

01:23.007 --> 01:26.716
catching the golden eggs as they fall
from the arse of the giant's chicken.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.600
I mean, there weren't any jobs
when I didn't want a job.

01:29.647 --> 01:32.844
And now I do want a job,
there are like, totally no jobs.

01:32.887 --> 01:36.277
Not just like, there aren't any jobs,
but like, there are totally,

01:36.327 --> 01:38.045
quite literally, no jobs.

01:38.087 --> 01:41.557
You should just get a van. With a
van, it's like you've got an MBA.

01:41.607 --> 01:43.484
But you've also got a fucking van.

01:43.527 --> 01:45.199
You're not just a man any more.

01:45.247 --> 01:47.681
You are a man with a van.

01:47.727 --> 01:51.037
You get a van, Jez,
we could be men with ven.

01:51.087 --> 01:53.282
This is a bunch of stuff,
got left on board.

01:53.327 --> 01:55.557
Thought you could feast on this lot.

01:55.607 --> 01:57.757
What is it?
Sex stuff? Booze? Drug gear?

01:57.807 --> 01:58.842
Baby shit.

01:58.887 --> 02:01.082
What?
Why did you bring that in here?

02:01.127 --> 02:03.641
Well, you two are on
some baby tip, ain't ya?

02:03.687 --> 02:06.326
One of you is the father of Sophie's
Jerry Springer baby.

02:06.367 --> 02:09.120
- We're not doing baby.
- Plenty of time for the baby later.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.204
The baby's too big. You can't look
at it, Hans, it's like the sun.

02:12.247 --> 02:14.966
Yeah, that's the policy.
What's in there, anyway?

02:15.007 --> 02:16.360
Baby shit.

02:16.407 --> 02:18.557
So small.

02:18.607 --> 02:21.599
No, no. No, thank you.
Put it under the bed, Jeremy.

02:21.647 --> 02:22.921
OK, yeah. It's going under there.

02:22.967 --> 02:26.084
Right, it's under there now.
It'll be safe under there.

02:26.127 --> 02:30.086
OK. Keys, change, wallet, phone. OK.

02:30.127 --> 02:32.243
Jesus, you are something else.

02:32.287 --> 02:33.481
Thank you very much.

02:33.527 --> 02:35.324
JEREMY: <i>He took the insult</i>
<i>as a complimentl</i>

02:35.367 --> 02:37.642
<i>Shit,</i>
<i>he could become invulnerable.</i>

02:37.687 --> 02:40.076
I'm just going to take off my
flatmate hat

02:40.127 --> 02:42.846
and put on my much larger,
new JLB manager's hat.

02:42.887 --> 02:46.084
- Have you not sorted this yet?
- (PHONE BEEPS)

02:46.127 --> 02:47.765
Hi, Colin.

02:47.807 --> 02:50.526
Listen, could you do me a favour
and take a punt on a grunt?

02:50.567 --> 02:52.842
Yeah, farmyard fodder, a day player.

02:52.887 --> 02:57.438
No overheads, no holiday, no contract.
Cut and shut. A phone pig.

02:57.487 --> 03:01.241
Ha-ha! Exactly. Cool, bro. Thanks.

03:01.287 --> 03:02.925
A phone pig?

03:02.967 --> 03:05.197
You're not going to lord it over me,
are you, Mark?

03:05.247 --> 03:07.044
Of course not.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.601
MARK: <i>Maybe I could make him</i>
<i>wear a little coloured hat</i>

03:09.647 --> 03:11.239
<i>like they do with chimpanzees.</i>

03:11.287 --> 03:13.881
<i>A comb with a propeller on top.</i>

03:13.927 --> 03:17.237
<i>I might tell him it's</i>
<i>a first day tradition.</i>

03:17.287 --> 03:20.996
<i>JEREMY: Wow, she is one hot tamale.</i>

03:21.047 --> 03:23.766
Did you hear the boiler in the night?
Were you hot?

03:23.807 --> 03:24.796
Whatever.

03:24.847 --> 03:27.600
I sleep naked,
head out of the window,

03:27.647 --> 03:31.435
so when I wake up
it's just me and the universe.

03:31.487 --> 03:33.125
But how? Your bed is on
the other side of the room.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.078
Got a system.

03:35.127 --> 03:38.597
JEREMY: <i>The maestro, magically</i>
<i>made her think of me naked.</i>

03:38.647 --> 03:40.683
<i>He didn't even clock her. Tragic.</i>

03:40.727 --> 03:42.524
MARK: <i>Think she spotted it.</i>

03:42.567 --> 03:44.842
<i>Just... Yeah.</i>

03:44.887 --> 03:49.005
<i>That's right, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Ergonomic management keyboard.</i>

03:50.567 --> 03:53.764
So this is it, Jeremy.
The field of screams.

03:53.807 --> 03:57.959
Colin will be in in ten,
but I think this'll be your... area.

03:58.007 --> 03:59.565
What, all of it?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.757
- Er, yes.
- Cool.

04:01.807 --> 04:04.685
Whoa, it's tippy!
I've got a tippy chair.

04:04.727 --> 04:08.083
Yeah, so you'll just be following
the cold-calling script.

04:08.127 --> 04:10.436
There's a script?
So I'll be, like, an actor?

04:10.487 --> 04:13.240
Exactly, Jeremy.
You'll be just like an actor,

04:13.287 --> 04:15.118
like Al Pacino or Jeremy Irons.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.204
Just tell everyone you call,
"You've been specially selected

04:18.247 --> 04:20.841
"as eligible for our exclusive
introductory interest rate."

04:20.887 --> 04:23.037
Well, no, not everyone.

04:23.087 --> 04:25.920
Because if it's exclusive, then...

04:25.967 --> 04:27.798
Oh, my God.

04:27.847 --> 04:29.565
It's wheels within wheels.

04:29.607 --> 04:34.123
I've been invited inside with the
bean counters and the water boarders.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.886

<i>find out what goes in sausages.</i>

04:38.367 --> 04:42.360

<i>the salary man keyboard.</i>

04:42.407 --> 04:44.967
<i>In with the Dominator,</i>
<i>the Death Star.</i>

04:45.007 --> 04:49.046
<i>Yeah, Dobby. I'll summon her in later.</i>

04:49.087 --> 04:50.918
<i>"Uh, Dobby, I seem to be</i>
<i>having a server problem.</i>

04:50.967 --> 04:54.118
<i>"Could you have a fiddle?</i>
<i>I think the problem is in my pants. "</i>

04:54.167 --> 04:56.920
- Oh, Jeff!
- I'm busy, Mark.

04:56.967 --> 05:00.243
Not too busy to check in with your boss.

05:00.287 --> 05:02.562
You're not me boss, Mark.
Stop calling yourself me boss.

05:02.607 --> 05:05.519
I'm head of a team
that contains people of your level.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.762
I'm certainly your superior,
let's leave it at that.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.275
I'm on your remuneration committee, so...

05:10.327 --> 05:13.205
fingers crossed for that bonus, Jeff.

05:13.247 --> 05:18.446
<i>What's funnier</i> - <i>zero bonus or,</i>
<i>like, a humiliating Â£ 103?</i>

05:18.487 --> 05:19.636
<i>Both are very funny.</i>

05:19.687 --> 05:22.804
Hey, man, can't stop. Just to say,
it's all going super great down there.

05:22.847 --> 05:23.836
You're not leaving.

05:23.887 --> 05:26.799
You've got to stay until at least
five or it makes me look bad.

05:26.847 --> 05:28.565
I've made four sales. I'm zinging.

05:28.607 --> 05:30.359
Colin's put me the top
of the leaderboard.

05:30.407 --> 05:31.886
I'm in line for Pizza Hut vouchers.

05:31.927 --> 05:35.363
You're king of the farmyard?
You're in line for the free garlic bread?

05:35.407 --> 05:37.841
- (ELECTRONIC BEEP)
- What's?

05:37.887 --> 05:39.479
Fire alarm.

05:39.527 --> 05:41.165
- Oh, God. Look at you.
- What?

05:41.207 --> 05:43.038
Frightened little mouse.

05:43.087 --> 05:44.566
It's a fire alarm, Jeremy.

05:44.607 --> 05:46.199
Oh, yeah, right. Like there's a fire.

05:46.247 --> 05:48.238
There's never a fire,
it just doesn't happen.

05:48.287 --> 05:49.436
I mean, maybe in a film.

05:49.487 --> 05:51.523
So there's never been a fire,
anywhere(?)

05:51.567 --> 05:54.161
Not in an office in England.
God, you're pathetic.

05:54.207 --> 05:57.358
"Ooh, fire, please don't burn me
or my possessions.

05:57.407 --> 05:59.875
"I'm so important and flammable."

05:59.927 --> 06:01.724
- Is this a test?
- No, not a test.

06:01.767 --> 06:04.361
Come on, Mark.
Fucking hell, get your elbows in.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.726
It's all gone <i>Backdraft.</i>

06:07.207 --> 06:08.356
What's going on?

06:08.407 --> 06:11.524
There's a rumour in that huddle
of third-floor Daleks that it's a test.

06:11.567 --> 06:14.764
But the phone pigs are sure there
was a fire in the farmyard kitchen.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.082
The maintenance man's
pulling his pud in the Portakabin.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.277
Come on. You're management, Corrigan.
Get it sorted.

06:19.327 --> 06:21.204
Right. Chance would be a fine thing.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.515
Mark, can't you reset it?

06:28.567 --> 06:30.683
Chance would be a fine thing, Lisa!

06:30.727 --> 06:32.957
I know what we should do. A coffee run.

- (LAUGHTER)
- Good one, Jeff.

06:37.247 --> 06:38.965
Chance would be a fine thing.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.759
A fine thing, indeed.

06:40.807 --> 06:42.923
<i>Hm, saying that too often now.</i>

06:42.967 --> 06:44.719
Everything's under control.

06:44.767 --> 06:47.486
We'll have it all sorted, as soon as.

06:47.527 --> 06:49.040

Everyone! Listen.

06:59.967 --> 07:04.961
So, listen up,
I just got in from Aberdeen.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.475
I want to warn you
that you're probably going to be

07:07.527 --> 07:08.755
hearing a lot of rumours,

07:08.807 --> 07:11.685
but I can reassure you
that Steffan Strauss

07:11.727 --> 07:14.924
and the rest in Frankfurt
are doing everything they can.

07:14.967 --> 07:18.801
Talks are ongoing and everything
is looking promising.

07:18.847 --> 07:22.123
But I need to inform you that
you're all officially unemployed.

I mean, how mad is that?
Headfuck or what?

07:58.047 --> 08:00.641
Yes, Jeremy. It is indeed a headfuck.

08:00.687 --> 08:03.565
Exactly. Pete was just saying a bunch
might go down the Crown.

08:03.607 --> 08:04.483
The Crown?

08:04.527 --> 08:06.722
You know,
where everyone goes on a Friday?

08:06.767 --> 08:10.123
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, down the Crown.

I cannot believe this. I can't.
They've really screwed us, man.

08:26.927 --> 08:29.395
They've screwed me.
They've diddled you, at most.

08:29.447 --> 08:32.325
It's like JLB never existed.

Puff! Just puff!

It's not our baby.
Can you stop saying that?

08:45.887 --> 08:48.117
<i>Ouch. Another one.</i>

08:48.167 --> 08:49.600
You should give her a warning look, Mark.

08:49.647 --> 08:51.239
Let's try and give her a warning look.

08:51.287 --> 08:53.801
Is it OK, do you think, to get involved?

08:53.847 --> 08:56.202
I guess a bit of
one of us is on board.

08:56.247 --> 08:59.239

- What?
- The wine, Soph.

09:09.127 --> 09:12.164
- I've had one small glass.
- We both know that's not true,

so let's start with the facts,
shall we, and...

09:14.807 --> 09:16.081
Cheers, Soph.

09:16.127 --> 09:17.276
Oh. We thought that was...

09:17.327 --> 09:20.046
One small spritzer, half a unit,
should I have got written permission?

09:20.087 --> 09:23.875
Written permission! Listen to her,
she's exaggerating for comic effect.

09:23.927 --> 09:26.521
It certainly has put me
well and truly in my place.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.556
Hey, guess what?

09:27.607 --> 09:29.438
<i>You love me and you</i>
<i>want to move to Norway?</i>

09:29.487 --> 09:32.877
Pete heard we're in profit.
The German outfit's the one tanking,

09:32.927 --> 09:35.885
but Strauss is closing up
the UK to save the mother ship.

09:35.927 --> 09:38.077
Jesus! You're kidding, is that true?

09:38.127 --> 09:41.403
Dunno, it might be one of those
rumours you get after disasters.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.280
Like, did you know nobody
with an Apple Mac died on 9/11?

09:44.327 --> 09:47.683
But we can't let them...
split up the team.

09:47.727 --> 09:52.243
I mean, you and me and,
and, you know, Lisa.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.561
It would be a tragedy...

09:53.607 --> 09:55.563
<i>If I couldn't see you any more.</i>
We've got to fight back.

09:55.607 --> 09:56.596
Yeah!

09:56.647 --> 10:00.083
Hear, hear. It's too beautiful
a thing to let just go puff!

10:00.127 --> 10:04.803
<i>OK, gotta build a JLB life raft.</i>
<i>Haul Dobby out of the water.</i>

10:04.847 --> 10:08.203
<i>"Come aboard, shipmate. Now let's</i>
<i>get you out of those wet clothes. "</i>

10:09.447 --> 10:12.598
I was thinking,
JLB Survivors' Campaign Group.

10:12.647 --> 10:15.161
Right, yeah. A grassroots
campaign to get justice.

10:15.207 --> 10:17.675
Grassroots, yeah.
But with me as the chair.

10:17.727 --> 10:20.799
Or president. President or chair.
Which do you reckon?

10:20.847 --> 10:22.644
Doesn't matter.
We'll campaign and I'll write a blog

10:22.687 --> 10:25.406
and I'll write to my MP
and I might go on The One Show...

10:25.447 --> 10:28.564
And I've got an idea for
a rather savage satirical cartoon.

10:28.607 --> 10:31.246
We could do a benefit night
and I might do a skit.

10:31.287 --> 10:33.437
You, in a skit? In front of people?

10:33.487 --> 10:35.637
It just think it would be fun.
I might do a skit with Dobby.

10:35.687 --> 10:37.917
Oh, right. I get it.
Yeah, the swish of the curtain,

10:37.967 --> 10:41.084
the smell of the greasepaint.
The rub-job in the dressing room.

10:41.127 --> 10:42.606
Oi, oi.

10:42.647 --> 10:45.366
3:40pm. Back home. Slightly pissed.

10:45.407 --> 10:48.080
Guess what? We both went to work
and it was brilliant,

10:48.127 --> 10:50.800
but then the whole company
got shut down and it was mad shit.

10:50.847 --> 10:51.916
We're both out of a job.

10:51.967 --> 10:54.765
Oh, well. More work for the men with ven.

10:54.807 --> 10:57.241
Recession.
Supper time for the vanners, dude.

10:57.287 --> 11:01.565
All these big beasts going belly up,
we're just vanning their shit out.

11:01.607 --> 11:03.598
Might give my contact a bell.

11:03.647 --> 11:06.764
See what bits of the JLB corpse
there are to chow down on.

11:06.807 --> 11:09.002
Hans, please. This is hard for us.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.800
I feel that something's
died inside, don't you, Mark?

11:11.847 --> 11:13.166
Uh-huh.

11:13.207 --> 11:15.243
It's such a weird day
for all of us JLBers.

11:15.287 --> 11:17.755
I mean, the whole thing's gone.
Just... puff!

11:17.807 --> 11:20.799
- Can you please stop doing that?
- Why? I'm really depressed.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.917
- You're not allowed to be depressed.
- Why not?

11:22.967 --> 11:26.004
Because you're freeloading on my trauma.
You're a grief thief.

11:26.047 --> 11:28.607
Bollocks. I really felt
I was finding my niche.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.286
You can't find your niche
between 9 and 11:30.

11:31.327 --> 11:33.204
Since when did you set
the niche-finding times?

11:33.247 --> 11:36.683
Look, the only reason you're romanticising
this job is you'll never get do it again.

11:36.727 --> 11:39.446
Oi, oi, oi! Byatt, Drabble.

11:39.487 --> 11:41.682
Relax. Come and have a look at this.

11:41.727 --> 11:44.525
MARK: <i>Jesus. Look at it.</i>

11:44.567 --> 11:48.446
<i>I wonder who the Prime Minister will</i>
<i>be when I've finished the repayments.</i>

11:48.487 --> 11:50.000
<i>An unborn Miliband?</i>

11:50.047 --> 11:54.006
The depression is here and my
new sofa is a white elephant.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.082
It's a creamy elephant.

11:55.127 --> 11:57.482
Please don't call it
the creamy elephant.

11:57.527 --> 11:59.119
I think I'm going to be sick.

11:59.167 --> 12:03.797
Jez, listen. If you're at a loose end,
I might need a couple of guys,

12:03.847 --> 12:06.156
do a job, cash-in-hand.

12:06.207 --> 12:10.519
Oh! The high quality upholstery
is like a knife in my back.

12:10.567 --> 12:12.523
All we need is another guy.

12:12.567 --> 12:14.842
Any guy with hands and arms and legs

12:14.887 --> 12:18.038
who might be around to just jump in
the van and earn a few quid.

12:18.087 --> 12:19.679
Hm. A guy...

12:19.727 --> 12:23.436
A guy who needs a bit of
cash, a guy, a guy, a guy...

12:23.487 --> 12:26.479
Where can we find just
a regular guy, any guy?

12:26.527 --> 12:29.360
I'm trying to think,
but I can't think.

12:30.127 --> 12:31.924
(MARK COUGHS)

12:31.967 --> 12:35.243
<i>How did this happen?</i>
<i>I woke up Branson,</i>

12:35.287 --> 12:39.519

<i>cash-in-hand for Super Hans.</i>

12:39.567 --> 12:40.966
Where do I go?

12:41.007 --> 12:44.044
You're riding bitch

12:44.087 --> 12:45.645
<i>God, Hans is my boss.</i>

12:45.687 --> 12:48.360
<i>Jeremy is probably my line manager.</i>

12:48.407 --> 12:51.001
Sorry for the delay.

12:51.047 --> 12:53.561
While I was waiting for the food,

12:53.607 --> 12:55.199
I actually sketched out
a potential invite

12:55.247 --> 12:58.523
for the JLB survivors' fundraiser.

12:58.567 --> 13:01.957
It's just a satirical sideswipe
at the corporate culture.

13:02.007 --> 13:07.286
<i>Star Wars?</i> "If you stroke my down
I shall become more purrful

13:07.327 --> 13:09.079
"than you can possibly imagine."

13:09.127 --> 13:10.640
Yeah.

13:10.687 --> 13:12.917
Isn't down for a duck, not a cat?

13:12.967 --> 13:16.676
Yes, but it's got to be cat
because of "purrful."

13:16.727 --> 13:18.365
- Does it?
- Yes.

13:18.407 --> 13:20.967
- But, "If you stroke my down..."
- Yes.

13:21.007 --> 13:22.360
...it's definitely got to be a duck.

13:22.407 --> 13:24.796
You're over-analysing.
People will be laughing so hard

13:24.847 --> 13:28.396
they won't be thinking about
what it does or doesn't mean, Jeremy.

13:28.447 --> 13:29.846

This is, this is...

13:36.007 --> 13:38.999
You fucked this order
right up, haven't you? Eh?

13:39.047 --> 13:40.924
Haven't you?

13:40.967 --> 13:43.117
Eh? Answer me!

13:43.167 --> 13:44.316
Yes.

13:44.367 --> 13:47.962
Right, I'm having your chicken wrap.
Jez, you can have the chips.

13:48.007 --> 13:52.842

It's great to see all the old faces,
isn't it?

14:18.287 --> 14:22.803
Yes, Jeremy, I invited everyone,
even Steffan Strauss from Frankfurt,

14:22.847 --> 14:26.806
though I doubt he'll be showing
his face, not after my cartoon.

14:26.847 --> 14:29.156
- You saw the cartoon, Soph?
- Yeah.

14:29.207 --> 14:31.516
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.717
Oh, brilliant. What did you like about it?

14:33.767 --> 14:35.644
It was a sort of joke, wasn't it?

14:35.687 --> 14:37.757
Yeah, that's right, Soph, exactly.

- Hi, Mark.

14:45.047 --> 14:47.925

look at my speech? Was it OK?

14:47.967 --> 14:51.516
Oh, yeah, amazing.

head office "avaricious profit cannibals",

14:55.527 --> 14:58.678
- or "mendacious bonus junkies"?
- Well, you're the boss, you decide.

<i>Exactly, I'm the boss.</i>

15:00.807 --> 15:03.605

knows how to crank up the volume.

- Tell him to turn it up to 11.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.882

15:30.887 --> 15:32.206
The moustache?

15:32.247 --> 15:36.445
Yeah. I'm having a mini wobble on
the moustache. What do you think?

15:36.487 --> 15:40.162
I just feel... I'm not trying to
associate JLB HQ with the Nazis,

15:40.207 --> 15:43.677
that would be reductive. I just want
to hint at certain similarities

15:43.727 --> 15:46.799
in terms of the unquestioning
approach both power structures

15:46.847 --> 15:50.078
want their underlings to adopt.
Do you think people will get that?

15:50.127 --> 15:51.526
Yeah.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.637
Maybe an Erich Honecker,

15:53.687 --> 15:56.679
a Bismarck, something
a little more tasty?

15:56.727 --> 15:59.366
Mark, you've got to get
the shit-munchers onside.

15:59.407 --> 16:00.920

An ailing patient,

16:13.927 --> 16:18.125
but one who's delivering
consistent profits, except for 2003.

16:18.167 --> 16:21.239
What on earth happened here?

16:21.287 --> 16:23.482

<i>She doesn't know who Barbara is.</i>

<i>Bloody hell, this is greatl</i>

16:37.247 --> 16:39.522
Oh, my God. They loved it!

16:39.567 --> 16:42.240
They didn't seem to go crazy
for the outsourcing IT material.

16:42.287 --> 16:45.006
Maybe they just spunked their wad
on the farmyard kettle shit.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.685
I know, that was massive!

16:46.727 --> 16:50.561

<i>I've written and directed a hit play</i>

16:52.447 --> 16:55.120
Man, that was so funny. Some of the guys
said it could be on TV.

16:55.167 --> 16:59.763
Oh, God,
what a ridiculous idea, that on TV!

16:59.807 --> 17:02.367
No, not without a lot of editing.

17:02.407 --> 17:05.319
It really is a crazy idea
at its current duration.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.243
And Steffan Strauss made it after all.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.436
I'm sorry?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.000
Hello, uh, Mark.

17:11.047 --> 17:13.402
Oh, hi, Steffan.

17:13.446 --> 17:17.326
We got your invite and we wanted
to show everyone's appreciation

17:17.367 --> 17:21.326
from the Frankfurt end for the UK
operation's good work over the years.

17:21.367 --> 17:22.766
Did you see the skit?

17:22.807 --> 17:24.205
Yes, I saw the skit.

17:24.247 --> 17:25.805
Oh, right. Good.

17:25.847 --> 17:28.759
<i>I've gone too far. Permanent marker.</i>

17:28.807 --> 17:32.322
<i>I'm Russell Brand. Steffan's lovely</i>
<i>Andrew Sachs.</i> Has it gone?

17:32.367 --> 17:34.927
No, and obviously there
must be a lot of anxiety

17:34.967 --> 17:39.961
over bonus and salary issues,
but JLB is doing all it can to help.

17:40.007 --> 17:41.281
That's great.

17:41.327 --> 17:45.002
Maybe we can chat further when
you've taken off your costume?

17:45.047 --> 17:47.117
I'm really sorry about the moustache.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.601
No, no, it's fine.
It's a difficult time.

17:49.647 --> 17:53.083
To me, Germany is Goethe
and Thomas Mann

17:53.127 --> 17:57.678
and Boris Becker, but it's difficult
to do a Goethe moustache.

17:57.727 --> 18:00.036
Did Goethe have a moustache,
out of interest?

18:00.087 --> 18:03.124
I don't know. I don't think so. Maybe.

18:03.167 --> 18:07.240
Really? That's fascinating. I'd like
to talk with you more about Goethe.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.606
I really am no expert.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.603
Oh, you're too modest.

18:10.647 --> 18:12.877
Look, come and have a chat next door
when you're ready.

18:12.927 --> 18:17.159

<i>room with the Gestapo.</i>

18:17.207 --> 18:18.765

<i>federal or state police.</i>

18:23.647 --> 18:25.797
So, what did you, um?

18:25.847 --> 18:28.361
Steffan wanted to have a chat
with you about some issues,

18:28.407 --> 18:31.444
about your JLB survivors' group.
It doesn't look good,

18:31.487 --> 18:33.364
some of the accusations flying around.

18:33.407 --> 18:34.635
We don't like friction.

18:34.687 --> 18:38.646
Their thing is... if the campaign
were to quieten down,

18:38.687 --> 18:40.518
maybe there'd be
a few more resources for redundancy.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.444
You might even get your bonus.

18:42.487 --> 18:43.761
They'll give us what we want?!

18:43.807 --> 18:46.162
No. But they can give you
what <i>you</i> want.

18:46.207 --> 18:50.758
On a one-off basis, if all this
unpleasantness was to go away.

18:52.087 --> 18:56.285
<i>They want to stuff my mouth</i>
<i>with gold. Lovely, chewy gold.</i>

18:56.327 --> 18:58.557
<i>I could pay-off the sofa,</i>
<i>I could buy the matching chair.</i>

18:58.607 --> 19:02.361
I told Steffan you might not
have the arsehole for this, Mark.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.523
You need a brass ringpiece to handle this.

19:04.567 --> 19:08.116
The question is,
can you put a lid on the squid?

19:10.407 --> 19:12.716
DOBBY: Listen up, mofos,

19:12.767 --> 19:16.760
cos it's the right honourable
Mr Mark Corrigan.

19:16.807 --> 19:20.561
(CHEERING)

19:20.607 --> 19:22.199
MAN: Speak for England, Arthur.

19:22.247 --> 19:24.397

Heil, Mark.

19:25.527 --> 19:26.755
(HE MOUTHS)

19:26.807 --> 19:31.403
Thank you, thank you, and it's great
that you could all come today.

19:31.447 --> 19:35.963
It's been a great afternoon
and we've had a lot of laughs,

19:36.007 --> 19:38.885
and I'd just like to say
about the JLB survivors' group,

19:38.927 --> 19:42.237
and the final salary payout battle,

19:42.287 --> 19:47.156
well, it's been a week now
and I think the time has come

19:47.207 --> 19:53.885
for us to stand up and say,
"We tried, we failed and we're moving on."

19:53.927 --> 19:56.566
- (THEY MURMUR)
- What do you mean?

19:56.607 --> 20:02.716
Look, JLB is a big multinational
and it's served us all

20:02.767 --> 20:06.555
a great big shit sandwich,
but what we've got to do

20:06.607 --> 20:08.996
is we've just got to eat it down.

20:09.047 --> 20:12.596
So let's go forward,
conserve our energy,

20:12.647 --> 20:18.165
let bygones be bygones, turn the music up
and have a great time!

20:18.207 --> 20:20.084

20:20.127 --> 20:24.405
MARK: <i>Oh, great(l) The chopper's</i>

<i>Just get to the buffet</i> -
<i>the safety of the buffet.</i>

20:27.367 --> 20:30.564
<i>If I can stuff my mouth with</i>
<i>enough salami, I won't be able to answer</i>

20:30.607 --> 20:32.802
<i>any difficult questions.</i>
- What the hell was that?

20:32.847 --> 20:35.486

20:35.527 --> 20:37.882
- What about our money?
- When are we gonna get our money?

20:37.927 --> 20:40.122
You worked at JLB
for less than three hours.

20:40.167 --> 20:41.805
I'll give you your bloody money!

20:41.847 --> 20:45.203
There's your money! Â£14.50!
Are you happy now?

20:45.247 --> 20:46.680
A bit, yes.

20:46.727 --> 20:49.036
Did they nobble you, Mark,
in the back room?

20:49.087 --> 20:51.282
Are you kidding?! I kicked off!

20:51.327 --> 20:54.922
I really want to hurt those bastards!
I think the cartoon rocked them.

20:54.967 --> 20:58.004
Let me have a think
about another savage pun.

20:58.047 --> 21:01.676
Oh, bollocks, Mark! Words and speeches
and ideas never change anything.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.445
- Let's do something.
- MAN: Yeah!

21:03.487 --> 21:04.806
Who's up for a raiding party?

21:04.847 --> 21:08.237
MARK: <i>Got to get Dobby back onside.</i>
<i>The doors will definitely be locked.</i>

21:08.287 --> 21:09.925

21:17.407 --> 21:19.284
We're going up there, to fuck shit up.

21:19.327 --> 21:20.680
No way.

21:20.727 --> 21:23.161
Oh, right, fair enough.
I suppose we'd better all just...

21:23.207 --> 21:25.277
- What?!
- Sorry, man. I've got keys.

21:25.327 --> 21:28.080
MARK: <i>Of course he's got keysl</i>
<i>He's carving up the JLB corpse.</i>

21:28.127 --> 21:29.845
We're just gonna take what's ours.

21:29.887 --> 21:32.640
Make your protest through
the agreed grievance procedure -

21:32.687 --> 21:35.440
- that's a good procedure.
- Riot!

21:35.487 --> 21:39.162
- Put it back, bitch! That's JLB's.
- MARK: <i>It's the pass at Thermopylae.</i>

<i>Fuck it, I'll work it out later.</i>

21:46.847 --> 21:50.044
<i>OK, what's the minimum criminal damage</i>
<i>I can get away with?</i>

21:50.087 --> 21:53.796
Take that!
Our work here is done! Let's go!

21:53.847 --> 21:54.802
Snow storm!

22:12.607 --> 22:15.075
Mission accomplished, guys! Let's roll.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.879
MARK: <i>Why has he got his shirt off?</i>

22:16.927 --> 22:19.122
<i>Any excuse and he'll take his shirt off.</i>

22:52.967 --> 22:54.958

Shall we?

Yeah, I mean,
I've copied a lot of shit on this copier,

23:08.487 --> 23:10.557
We're shredding, Mark. What's going on?

23:10.607 --> 23:16.079
Nothing. Well, I mean,
obviously we're fucking everything up,

23:16.127 --> 23:18.436
and the fact
that you're probably insured for all this

23:18.487 --> 23:20.796
doesn't make a blind bit of difference
to us.

23:20.847 --> 23:25.637

23:25.687 --> 23:29.236
