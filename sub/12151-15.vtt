00:01.929 --> 00:02.910
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:06.750
Holtz, we took a lot from you,
that's true.

00:07.929 --> 00:11.230
Now's your chance. Do it.
Finish it while you still can.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.320
You can't just let him walk
away. Not after what you swore to me.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.960
Go out and find others like you,
people who have suffered as we have.

00:19.329 --> 00:22.489
- What's this?
- Take Groo someplace nice.

00:23.530 --> 00:24.789
You'd like that.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.219
- What about my son?
- He has a role to play.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.769
I've located commentaries on
the prophecies concerning your son.

00:40.929 --> 00:44.579
You gotta admire the loyalty.
All night here, hitting the books...

00:45.130 --> 00:48.960
...logging serious alone-time delving
into the secret mysteries of....

00:49.929 --> 00:51.509
Man, Wesley needs a life.

00:52.329 --> 00:55.140
I wonder if he found
anything new about Connor.

00:55.929 --> 00:57.259
Don't touch that.

00:58.929 --> 01:02.479
They're just in a specific order.
I'll be lost.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.469
What time is it?

01:06.730 --> 01:10.060
Time for Wesley to wakey-wakey,
isn't that right, Connor?

01:10.329 --> 01:12.650
I must have lost track of the time.

01:13.329 --> 01:15.579
I meant to go home.

01:16.329 --> 01:17.659
Road to hell, right?

01:18.129 --> 01:20.230
You find any answers
in all these stuffy books?

01:20.530 --> 01:23.439
He already knows the answer,
he's looking for the question.

01:24.129 --> 01:25.879
Have we heard from Cordelia recent--?

01:25.930 --> 01:28.209
Wanna see Connor do something cool?

01:29.530 --> 01:31.849
I'm teaching him how to die.

01:32.530 --> 01:33.579
Don't.

01:40.329 --> 01:41.939
Ticktock, Wes.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.620
Running out of time.

01:45.129 --> 01:47.090
Running out of time.

02:00.730 --> 02:03.709
Morning, Wes. You been here all night?

03:01.050 --> 03:04.840
You'd think somebody was killing him.
All night, the screaming and crying....

03:05.849 --> 03:09.849
- Colic is the worst.
- I hold him, I walk him. Nothing works.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.330
Have you tried the vacuum?

03:13.650 --> 03:16.629
Sometimes the white noise from a
motor will put a colicky baby to sleep.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.900
You know, I read about that.

03:19.650 --> 03:22.810
The problem is, I can't run the vacuum
while my older one is sleeping.

03:23.250 --> 03:26.939
You could try taping the sound.
Leave it playing by the crib.

03:27.449 --> 03:31.030
I should have thought of that.
Mr. Dad to the rescue.

03:32.849 --> 03:34.080
Mrs. Ferguson?

03:34.050 --> 03:35.379
Excuse me.

03:39.449 --> 03:43.169
"Mr. Dad."
Check me out. I'm Mr. Dad.

03:45.449 --> 03:46.960
You okay, Wes?

03:47.849 --> 03:49.710
Just a bit tired, is all.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.949
Probably good you got
out of the office.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.969
You've been all holed up with
all those prophecies and books.

03:58.050 --> 04:01.349
I've been working on
a particularly difficult translation.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.270
Is it about Connor?
Anything we have to worry about?

04:05.849 --> 04:08.969
- Mr. Angel?
- We're up, kiddo.

04:13.050 --> 04:16.379
- You coming in?
- In case you forget to ask anything.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.269
Always better to have
an extra pair of ears, right?

04:20.850 --> 04:23.449
It's like a....
It's like a soft gurgle.

04:24.449 --> 04:27.259
Or a wheeze. It might be a wheeze.

04:27.449 --> 04:29.550
I heard it last night
when I fed him. Hear it?

04:30.449 --> 04:32.310
I hear a normal, healthy heart.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.779
You don't understand,
I got, like, really good hearing.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.000
I mean really good hearing.

04:37.649 --> 04:39.819
Well, most first-time parents do.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.370
This wheeze or gurgle happened
while you were feeding him?

04:43.050 --> 04:46.490
- Is that bad? What is it?
- In my professional opinion...

04:47.250 --> 04:49.069
...it's called digestion.

04:52.649 --> 04:57.250
During your exam, you didn't notice
anything abnormal about him?

04:58.050 --> 05:01.029
Wes, what kind of question is that?
Did you?

05:01.649 --> 05:03.509
No, your son is just fine.

05:04.050 --> 05:06.470
When will we get
the results from the blood test?

05:07.050 --> 05:10.350
- In a week. It's just a precaution.
- But Connor's healthy?

05:11.250 --> 05:13.879
As healthy as a human being
can possibly be.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.709
- Did you hear that? Thank you.
- No problem.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.459
Thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks.

05:19.649 --> 05:22.910
Angel? You can let go
of the doctor now.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.069
Right. Come on, kiddo. Yeah.
Thanks.

05:28.649 --> 05:30.439
Take care.

05:32.850 --> 05:35.310
And they bitch about my cold hands.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.600
Yeah.

06:02.850 --> 06:06.360
Did you get turned around?
You're supposed to be in Exam 3.

06:07.050 --> 06:08.800
My mistake.

06:10.089 --> 06:14.660
No last name, no bank account.
How you ordering stuff off the Web?

06:15.490 --> 06:18.610
It's not hard. You hack
into the shipping database...

06:19.089 --> 06:23.019
...find somebody who's ordering what you
want and substitute your information.

06:23.889 --> 06:25.959
Except that would be
high-tech robbery.

06:26.290 --> 06:28.680
I memorized Cordelia's
credit card number.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.680
Low-tech robbery.

06:33.490 --> 06:38.620
- Some kind of boomerang vamp stake?
- No. They're itty-bitty hockey sticks.

06:40.689 --> 06:42.480
Check this out.

06:43.089 --> 06:45.829
How cute is this?

06:47.889 --> 06:50.769
- Seriously.
- You got too much time on your hands.

06:52.089 --> 06:56.230
- Come on, you think it's adorable.
- At least I'm manly enough to deny it.

06:56.889 --> 07:01.910
Things have been slow since Cordelia
and the Groosalugg went on vacation.

07:02.889 --> 07:08.300
I'm actually jonesing for a throw-down
with something mean and nasty.

07:08.889 --> 07:12.149
Cordelia hasn't called once w;th
a vision. Do they have phones there?

07:13.089 --> 07:15.829
Maybe they're not near a phone.
It's a vacation.

07:16.089 --> 07:18.790
They're not gonna waste it all
in a dark hotel room...

07:19.089 --> 07:22.500
...together, where food's delivered
and there's no reason to go outside--

07:23.290 --> 07:26.620
- Hockey's a great sport.
- It's the whitest sport known to man.

07:27.490 --> 07:30.790
- But the games are indoors, at night.
- Got you.

07:31.089 --> 07:34.779
I know it's a little early to think
about stuff like this...

07:35.889 --> 07:38.910
...but I can't wait to watch him,
you know, grow up.

07:39.490 --> 07:43.560
For him to lose his first tooth.
Learn how to ride a bike.

07:44.889 --> 07:48.470
I wanna help him pick out a tux
for his senior prom.

07:49.089 --> 07:51.509
I just can't wait to see
who he's gonna be.

07:52.089 --> 07:56.300
I know that's mushy,
but he just makes me so happy.

07:58.689 --> 08:02.660
- He shoots, he scores!
- Sure, of course, with no defender.

08:03.490 --> 08:07.110
- Bring it on.
- I think Connor is gonna be a center.

08:07.689 --> 08:10.290
- What you got?
- Controlling the puck.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.819
- Ditching the left wing.
- Come on.

08:14.889 --> 08:17.420
Taking it all the way to the crease--

08:20.889 --> 08:23.379
Yeah, you know,
this isn't regulation size.

08:23.889 --> 08:27.399
Excuse me.
Is this Angel Investigations?

08:29.889 --> 08:31.990
I need your help.

08:33.129 --> 08:37.450
Last Monday night, my son Timothy
snuck out of the house.

08:38.529 --> 08:40.389
He left to go to the pier.

08:40.929 --> 08:43.350
He loved the lights
on the Ferris wheel.

08:44.529 --> 08:48.669
So I went after him. I searched
the pier, the arcade.... Nothing.

08:49.929 --> 08:53.409
So I sat up all night
and waited for him to come home.

08:53.529 --> 08:56.059
When did he return home?
Right before dawn?

08:57.129 --> 08:59.620
Yeah. But his face was....

09:00.129 --> 09:03.110
There was something wrong
with his face.

09:03.730 --> 09:06.429
And he was so angry.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.169
He was calling me names
and pounding on the door...

09:10.929 --> 09:14.899
...and screaming at me to let him in.

09:15.129 --> 09:17.519
It scared me.

09:18.730 --> 09:21.960
I was afraid of my own son.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.779
And then he just...

09:26.529 --> 09:28.669
...went up in flames.

09:31.929 --> 09:34.320
If you'd let him in,
he would have killed you.

09:34.330 --> 09:36.289
- At least he'd still be alive.
- No.

09:36.730 --> 09:40.059
What came to your door wasn't your son.
It looked like him, but it wasn't him.

09:40.929 --> 09:43.490
Maybe I could have found
a way to turn him back.

09:43.929 --> 09:46.600
When somebody becomes a vampire,
there's no turning back.

09:46.929 --> 09:50.259
No matter how much you believe there's
some part of him you can save...

09:51.129 --> 09:53.940
...all that's left is an evil thing.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.750
You say your son went
to the pier that night?

10:01.330 --> 10:04.519
- Gunn, why don't you do a little recon.
- I could gear up and take care of it.

10:04.929 --> 10:07.980
No. If there's a nest, we go as a group.
Strictly reconnaissance.

10:08.529 --> 10:10.460
Fred and I will check it out.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.350
If I could have found
that thing myself...

10:13.929 --> 10:16.559
...I would have killed it
with my bare hands.

10:16.929 --> 10:20.720
It made me afraid
of my own little boy.

10:21.730 --> 10:25.909
I don't understand any of this.
I don't know what to do.

10:26.529 --> 10:30.289
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce heads
the staff at Angel Investigations.

10:30.730 --> 10:34.309
Doles out assignments, specializes
in reference and research.

10:34.929 --> 10:39.740
This woman, Fred, is the science
expert. It's unclear if she's a fighter.

10:40.929 --> 10:45.110
Finally, Charles Gunn. Big, strong,
could be a formidable opponent...

10:45.730 --> 10:49.799
...though he seems a bit impulsive.
We may be able to use that.

10:52.330 --> 10:54.610
Good work, Aubrey.

10:55.330 --> 10:56.940
Thanks, boss.

11:10.450 --> 11:14.000
I don't understand. How can
these people work for a vampire?

11:14.850 --> 11:18.009
- I once made a pact with a demon.
- So you could get to Angelus.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.029
So you could kill a vampire.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.899
I'm sure they believe their reasons
are good, however misguided.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.639
Things aren't always black and white,
good and evil.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.710
What about Angelus?

11:32.250 --> 11:34.210
He's evil.

11:58.649 --> 12:01.389
Chains would be good now.

12:11.850 --> 12:14.240
I knew you were meant for this.

12:14.850 --> 12:19.029
We need to get moving. Events are
happening quicker than I could've hoped.

12:19.649 --> 12:22.669
Thank God. I'm starting to get bored.

12:26.850 --> 12:30.259
You know, my barber has
the same problem with his scissors.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.450
Hence the bad haircut.

12:32.850 --> 12:35.549
Love the whole chained,
undead look you got going on.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.100
Really sets off your fern.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.669
Stand down, Justine.
It's only Sahjhan.

12:41.250 --> 12:44.659
"Only Sahjhan"? See, that's
the trouble with you, Holtz.

12:45.450 --> 12:47.549
If you'd only done what you'd--

12:48.450 --> 12:50.590
Can we have a little privacy here?

12:51.450 --> 12:54.820
- No.
- Fine. You owe me a dead vampire.

12:55.649 --> 12:59.860
Yes, well, how should I put this?
What are you going to do about it?

13:01.649 --> 13:03.440
Nothing, that's what you'll do.

13:04.049 --> 13:08.509
It's all you can do, or else you
wouldn't have brought me here.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.190
You've done your part, Sahjhan.
Now let me do mine.

13:13.049 --> 13:17.049
What is your part? Recruiting a bunch
of paramilitary Moonie freaks...

13:17.850 --> 13:21.259
...to play Candid Camera
with Angel's buddies? That's crap.

13:22.049 --> 13:25.070
Admit it, you're a coward.

13:25.649 --> 13:29.899
And I bet Caroline would agree.
You remember her, don't you?

13:30.450 --> 13:33.710
Your dead wife,
mother of your dead kids.

13:35.250 --> 13:39.080
How'd they die? Who swore revenge?

13:39.450 --> 13:41.980
Any of this ringing a bell?

13:43.649 --> 13:46.840
- Get out.
- Or what? You can't kill me.

13:47.850 --> 13:51.399
But I can trap your dimensional
essence in a Resikhian urn.

13:52.049 --> 13:55.840
They last a lifetime.
That is, if you live forever.

13:57.450 --> 14:00.289
This isn't over, Holtz.

14:02.250 --> 14:06.149
I know it's dangerous.
I don't care. You're a wizard.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.299
Because it's the right thing to do.

14:11.850 --> 14:16.269
Then because I'm paying you an obscene
amount of money. Do it and call me.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.110
- Hey, Wes?
- What is it?

14:20.850 --> 14:24.110
- You're busy, I'll come back.
- What can I do for you?

14:25.049 --> 14:26.769
Nothing.

14:28.049 --> 14:30.049
I just wanted to compliment you.

14:30.450 --> 14:34.799
You were really there for that woman,
Aubrey, who lost her kid at the pier.

14:35.850 --> 14:36.720
Thank you.

14:37.049 --> 14:40.029
You've been working so hard,
staring at all these books.

14:40.649 --> 14:43.840
As a book-starer myself,
I know how crazy-making that can be.

14:44.850 --> 14:49.419
You should get out of here.
Go for a walk. You deserve it.

14:52.049 --> 14:55.029
I was thinking maybe
you could call Aubrey.

14:55.649 --> 14:59.620
Her paperwork says she's single.
She probably needs a friend.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.129
Fred?

15:03.450 --> 15:07.840
We're not here to date.
We're here to do a job.

15:10.049 --> 15:13.100
Now, why don't you go to the pier
and do your job.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.730
Is everything all right?
Are they taking care of you?

15:24.450 --> 15:27.820
No, Mom, this is Lilah.
You called Lilah.

15:28.649 --> 15:32.090
Do you need anything?
Do you need money?

15:32.850 --> 15:35.830
No, Mom, I can't come over.
I'm in Los Angeles.

15:36.450 --> 15:38.450
You know that.

15:38.850 --> 15:42.220
Don't cry. Mom, please stop it.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.409
I'm gonna have to call you back.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.909
- You don't have an appointment.
- That's it?

15:54.450 --> 15:57.149
No "Wow, how'd he do that?"
No screaming in terror?

15:57.450 --> 15:59.840
You 21st century types are so jaded.

16:00.450 --> 16:04.169
You're Sahjhan, aren't you?
I may be jaded, but I do my homework.

16:04.649 --> 16:08.649
And there's a girl downstairs with
records on everything.

16:09.450 --> 16:13.279
- My company rocks.
- Yes, I'm familiar with your firm.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.179
In this and other dimensions.

16:16.049 --> 16:19.629
You're a time shifter. You
recruited Holtz in the 18th century...

16:20.250 --> 16:23.659
...put him on ice so he could pop up and
stake Angel when he's least expecting it.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.639
Considering I have yet to dance
on Angel's pile of dust...

16:28.649 --> 16:31.529
...I'm imagining that Holtz isn't
working fast enough for you.

16:31.649 --> 16:34.490
And you think my firm could
expedite the process.

16:35.850 --> 16:37.289
More or less.

16:37.649 --> 16:42.809
Wolfram & Hart's official policy is
to let Angel live until he is useful.

16:43.649 --> 16:45.649
I'm sworn to obey that policy.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.919
Is there some other way
we can help you?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.799
I have a plan. But for it to work...

16:59.850 --> 17:03.110
...I require a very rare
and valuable ingredient.

17:04.049 --> 17:07.490
Getting it will be difficult,
if not impossible.

17:08.250 --> 17:11.089
- I need the blood of Angel's son.
- Got it.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.829
Got it? How'd you get it?

17:13.650 --> 17:16.809
Swiped it from his doctor's office.
I don't know what good it will do you.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.410
Boys in the lab said
it was completely normal.

17:20.848 --> 17:23.618
That's because they're looking
for the wrong thing.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.529
So I'm looking
for anything suspicious...

17:35.210 --> 17:38.299
...like small, dark places where
somebody could get grabbed...

17:38.809 --> 17:43.450
...any blacked-out cars or vans,
or pale, bumpy people with sharp teeth.

17:44.210 --> 17:48.490
Don't worry about seeing any actual
vamps. The sun's still up in the sky.

17:49.609 --> 17:52.069
Even so, as professionals,
shouldn't we be aware--?

17:52.609 --> 17:55.349
Ring toss. Want me
to be all macho and win you a prize?

17:55.609 --> 17:58.450
- Charles.
- All right, you can be the macho one.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.529
Look at that stuffed bunny.
Could you win it for me?

18:04.009 --> 18:07.450
- This is so wrong.
- You're right. I don't want the bunny.

18:08.210 --> 18:11.970
- We're supposed to be working.
- No, we're doing some bogus recon.

18:12.410 --> 18:14.829
- Still, it's our job.
- Actually, this was my job.

18:15.410 --> 18:18.920
Wes never said to bring you. Probably
sent me so he could chat up my girl.

18:19.609 --> 18:21.400
Wesley wouldn't do that.

18:22.009 --> 18:23.829
I'm your girl?

18:24.410 --> 18:27.180
Wes knows about us,
and you didn't let me know?

18:28.009 --> 18:31.059
You knew he was interested in you.
Now he knows we're seeing each other.

18:31.609 --> 18:36.740
I don't think he likes the idea of us
dating while we're working together.

18:37.609 --> 18:39.859
He said something to you, didn't he?

18:42.410 --> 18:43.880
You got my back, right?

18:44.210 --> 18:47.619
You told him what we do with our
personal lives isn't his business, right?

18:48.410 --> 18:51.500
Oh, you bet I.... Didn't.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.069
I like you and I want
to keep liking you.

18:55.609 --> 18:56.480
Then do.

18:56.809 --> 18:59.509
Maybe when we're out like this,
we should just work.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.130
No. Can't do it that way.

19:02.210 --> 19:06.420
Maybe I'm greedy, but I want it all.
The great girl and the great job.

19:07.009 --> 19:12.069
I'm not giving up either
without a fight. How about you?

19:15.410 --> 19:16.880
Good.

19:18.410 --> 19:21.599
Now, how about we go looking
for some vampires?

19:34.009 --> 19:35.619
It's coming at you.

19:40.009 --> 19:41.900
I have to leave for a while.

19:42.410 --> 19:46.480
Wes, what's going on?
You've been on edge for days.

19:47.210 --> 19:48.890
Talk to me.

19:49.609 --> 19:51.750
I just want to make sure
everything's okay.

19:52.009 --> 19:54.220
You mean, with Connor?

19:55.609 --> 19:59.680
You didn't mean to give Uncle Wesley
such a headache, now, did you?

20:01.009 --> 20:02.970
I won't be long.

20:06.410 --> 20:07.809
Hey, Wes?

20:08.809 --> 20:10.319
Thanks.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.569
You're a good friend.

20:13.009 --> 20:14.829
Isn't he?

20:16.849 --> 20:19.059
We should be getting back.

20:19.849 --> 20:23.710
Hang on.
I'm getting a tingle.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.779
I thought we were gonna keep
that out of the workplace.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.599
Not that kind of tingle.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.740
I don't see anything suspicious.

20:37.849 --> 20:42.099
Except that guy trying to break
into that building over there.

20:44.450 --> 20:46.839
The carousel closed hours ago.

20:59.450 --> 21:03.029
- Is that a vampire?
- Only one way to find out.

21:03.650 --> 21:05.789
- Charles, what are you doing?
- My job.

21:06.650 --> 21:09.809
I didn't walk the pier all day just to
go home and file a report with Wesley.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.509
- Let's finish this.
- We're not supposed to be doing this.

21:49.849 --> 21:51.779
When I say "go," run!

22:00.049 --> 22:01.839
- Get out of here. Go!
- But--

22:06.650 --> 22:09.319
- They're gonna kill him.
- Maybe.

22:37.849 --> 22:40.759
- Shouldn't we do some--?
- No. That's not why we're here.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.789
Behind you!

22:52.849 --> 22:54.809
Well, what do you know.

22:57.650 --> 22:59.650
Fred, why are you still here?

23:01.849 --> 23:04.240
I got your back.

23:06.650 --> 23:09.700
Well, actually, I got his back.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.079
Thanks.

23:22.490 --> 23:25.720
Thirty-four degrees,
12 minutes north...

23:26.089 --> 23:29.279
... 118, 21...

23:31.490 --> 23:33.210
...west.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.539
This...

23:35.690 --> 23:37.509
...must be it.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.529
You're supposed to be a statue.

23:48.289 --> 23:50.250
Guess you are.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.680
Sort of.

23:56.089 --> 23:59.210
If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kill that wizard.

24:14.690 --> 24:18.970
Accept this offering,
and open the gates of truth.

24:29.690 --> 24:32.500
How dare you call on the loa?

24:33.890 --> 24:36.279
I come in supplication, O great one...

24:36.890 --> 24:40.720
...begging for answers to questions
only your power can reveal.

24:41.690 --> 24:46.990
You have answers, human.
You search now only for the question.

24:48.289 --> 24:53.000
Is it true? Will Angel really kill his
son as it says in the prophecies?

24:53.690 --> 24:57.829
That the vampire will devour
his child is certain.

24:58.490 --> 25:01.789
The dark question you harbor
is only, when?

25:02.690 --> 25:07.680
No. The dark question
I harbor is, how do I stop it?

25:08.690 --> 25:10.059
It cannot be stopped.

25:10.490 --> 25:13.369
It has to be stopped!
There must be a way--

25:15.289 --> 25:18.269
Your insolence is displeasing.

25:18.890 --> 25:21.210
You try chatting
with a cranky hamburger.

25:21.890 --> 25:25.369
You risk your life, human,
calling on the loa.

25:26.089 --> 25:31.220
Perhaps what you really seek is death.
The pain in your heart begs for it.

25:32.089 --> 25:34.930
Then do it and be done.
Nothing else will stop me.

25:35.690 --> 25:38.809
Simple mortal,
your pain is just beginning.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.569
Betrayal and agony lie in wait.

25:41.690 --> 25:46.109
And time is running out.
Yet still you ignore the question.

25:47.089 --> 25:49.619
All right, then when?
When will this happen?

25:50.089 --> 25:54.480
The first portent will shake the earth.
The second will burn the air.

25:55.490 --> 25:59.349
The last will turn the sky to blood.

26:02.089 --> 26:04.759
An earthquake?
That's the first portent?

26:05.089 --> 26:09.299
- We live in California.
- Earthquake, fire, blood.

26:10.490 --> 26:15.440
Be heedful of the signs, human,
and trouble the loa no more.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.869
I need a drink.
Scotch, 30-year-old, two ice cubes.

26:25.490 --> 26:27.099
Certainly.

26:32.690 --> 26:35.849
Not on your best day. Bye.

26:42.289 --> 26:43.799
Enjoy.

26:52.490 --> 26:54.519
Sorry I'm late.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.609
Kind of ironic,
my being a time shifter and all.

26:59.089 --> 27:01.480
- It's on.
- It's on?

27:02.089 --> 27:04.410
Our plan? The Angel plan? On.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.809
I outsourced the labor,
buried the costs.

27:07.490 --> 27:11.420
We shouldn't have any problem
with the firm. Good seeing you.

27:12.289 --> 27:15.799
Okay, but let's skip the small talk
and get down to business.

27:16.490 --> 27:20.069
I time-skipped 133 years for this.
Would a little conversation kill you?

27:20.690 --> 27:25.150
Right. 'Cause we're on a date?
I met you here so we could talk freely.

27:25.490 --> 27:26.720
So let's talk freely.

27:27.289 --> 27:31.079
Would it impress you if I told you
I invented daylight-savings time?

27:32.089 --> 27:35.990
Why do you want Angel dead?
It's the only thing I couldn't find.

27:36.890 --> 27:39.940
Boy, all work and no play.

27:41.089 --> 27:42.630
I have my reasons.

27:43.490 --> 27:46.019
How about you?
Dyed-in-the-wool company gal...

27:46.490 --> 27:48.380
...why risk it all to kill Angel?

27:48.890 --> 27:50.819
We have our history.

27:51.289 --> 27:53.460
Well, same here.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.420
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

27:57.890 --> 27:59.710
Then what are you afraid of?

28:00.289 --> 28:03.660
You may be insubstantial,
but I can still smell the fear.

28:04.490 --> 28:07.539
Wow. Where does the time go?

28:08.690 --> 28:11.180
So when does this plan go into effect?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.970
It's already started.

28:29.730 --> 28:34.400
Hi. Sorry to interrupt your staring.
You looked into it.

28:35.730 --> 28:38.990
Aubrey. I didn't hear you come in.

28:39.329 --> 28:40.910
Please.

28:44.730 --> 28:48.029
I got your message that
everything was taken care of.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.839
I can't tell you
how grateful I am to you.

28:52.529 --> 28:55.130
It might have been too late
for Timothy...

28:55.529 --> 28:59.359
...but at least those monsters won't
be able to take someone else's son.

29:03.329 --> 29:06.839
"Monsters." I don't recall mentioning
there were more than one.

29:07.529 --> 29:11.599
Well, you did say before
that there could be a nest.

29:15.930 --> 29:19.089
Well, thanks for the check.
We'll mail you the receipt.

29:20.130 --> 29:24.170
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but are you okay?

29:24.930 --> 29:28.339
No offense, but you look
a little rough around the edges.

29:29.130 --> 29:30.990
I'm not sleeping very well.

29:33.329 --> 29:36.349
Would you like to go out?
Get a cup of coffee or something?

29:36.930 --> 29:39.349
You mean, with you?

29:39.930 --> 29:42.769
To be perfectly honest with you...

29:44.130 --> 29:46.450
...I could use a friend right now.

29:47.130 --> 29:50.009
Ever since my son was....

29:51.930 --> 29:53.960
It gets lonely.

29:54.930 --> 29:57.000
You're good.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.349
I like the "lonely" thing.

30:02.130 --> 30:06.380
- What?
- Yeah, "lonely." That was a nice touch.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.890
- Moves like a fighter, not a victim.
- Yes.

30:12.930 --> 30:16.230
You set up my friends.
They could have been killed.

30:16.529 --> 30:21.029
But they weren't. Your friends
are still alive. My little boy isn't.

30:25.529 --> 30:27.279
I'm sorry about your son.

30:28.529 --> 30:33.059
Is that how Holtz found you?
Because of what happened to your son?

30:35.730 --> 30:39.309
You're right to protect him.
Holtz is one of the good guys.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.720
He has every right to hate me.

30:42.329 --> 30:46.329
And if he ever comes close
to any of my people ever again...

30:47.130 --> 30:51.200
...or tries to touch a hair
on my son's head, I'll kill him.

30:51.930 --> 30:55.579
And anyone who gets in the way.
You might wanna mention that.

31:11.130 --> 31:14.220
Good boy. That's my little guy.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.150
Your first earthquake.

31:21.609 --> 31:23.500
Behind you!

31:25.809 --> 31:30.549
This tiny girl....
Outsized, outmatched, outnumbered.

31:31.809 --> 31:33.630
And she survived.

31:33.609 --> 31:37.400
Why? Because she was willing not to.

31:38.410 --> 31:42.660
She was prepared to die for the cause
rather than abandon her comrade.

31:43.210 --> 31:47.210
We, too, must be willing to die.
But more so.

31:48.609 --> 31:52.539
Study this carefully. You'll be
fighting these two very soon.

31:55.809 --> 31:58.650
Perhaps sooner than I expected.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.220
They found you out.

32:09.009 --> 32:11.329
- I'm sorry.
- It's not important.

32:12.009 --> 32:14.819
I am annoyed you allowed
yourself to be followed.

32:15.009 --> 32:16.619
Don't blame her.

32:19.210 --> 32:21.670
I would have found you eventually.

32:27.049 --> 32:29.470
Maybe we should cut out his tongue.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.400
- Send a message to Angelus.
- Maybe.

32:34.849 --> 32:37.619
Or perhaps you could lie on the floor
and gag for a while.

32:40.849 --> 32:43.690
I didn't come here to fight.
I'm not your enemy.

32:44.450 --> 32:47.359
But you do have trouble
making the distinction.

32:47.450 --> 32:49.769
- You're fighting the wrong man.
- Angelus?

32:50.450 --> 32:51.890
No. Angel.

32:52.250 --> 32:55.579
He's not Angelus anymore.
He's a good man.

32:56.450 --> 33:00.559
- He's not even a man.
- Nevertheless, he has a soul now.

33:01.250 --> 33:04.900
Yes, that he might know the pain
he's inflicted on his countless victims.

33:05.450 --> 33:09.869
A brilliant curse, I admit. Gypsies
have a knack for creative vengeance.

33:10.849 --> 33:14.920
Where they fail, however,
is in the execution of justice.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.210
And that I will have.

33:18.650 --> 33:21.599
If it's a sacrifice you require,
take me.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.180
Angel's no more responsible
for the crimes of Angelus than I am.

33:27.049 --> 33:31.049
Was it your hands that held down my
wife as she was violated and murdered?

33:31.849 --> 33:34.900
That wrapped around my son's neck
and snapped it like kindling?

33:35.450 --> 33:38.430
Were yours the hands
that clutched at my daughter...

33:39.049 --> 33:42.279
...as she was turned into
a creature damned for eternity?

33:42.650 --> 33:45.769
Angelus is in his nature.
The beast will re-emerge.

33:46.250 --> 33:50.289
You've seen it, you know it.
And that is why you are here.

33:51.650 --> 33:54.460
You're afraid
he's going to kill the child.

33:57.049 --> 33:59.299
And you're right.

34:01.250 --> 34:04.549
Your infiltration was more
successful than I had realized.

34:05.450 --> 34:08.360
I don't need prophecies
to tell me what is plain.

34:08.449 --> 34:13.440
So long as the child remains
with the demon, it's not safe.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.440
Well, I must have misunderstood.

34:18.050 --> 34:22.650
I thought it was a blood vendetta.
You really want to protect Angel's son.

34:24.050 --> 34:26.050
- You don't believe me?
- Not sure, really.

34:26.449 --> 34:29.780
It could be the low, scary voice
that's giving me trouble.

34:33.050 --> 34:36.630
It's time to make a decision,
Mr. Wyndam-Pryce.

34:37.250 --> 34:41.289
My army is strong
and will only increase in number.

34:42.050 --> 34:45.239
Fight against us,
and this war will become a bloodbath.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.210
This isn't war. It's revenge.

34:49.250 --> 34:54.059
What's wrong with revenge?
It's all some of us have left.

34:55.849 --> 34:58.619
I can't know what
it's been like for any of you.

34:59.449 --> 35:01.940
You might, soon enough.

35:04.849 --> 35:09.170
When I put my son's body into the
ground, I had to open the coffin...

35:09.650 --> 35:12.179
...just to know
that he really was in there.

35:12.650 --> 35:17.219
You also may discover that a child's
coffin, Mr. Wyndam-Pryce...

35:18.050 --> 35:19.659
...it weighs nothing.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.539
Barely touched your food.

35:38.610 --> 35:41.519
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:46.409 --> 35:50.659
Look, I've been thinking about
yesterday. I'm not really mad at Wes.

35:51.809 --> 35:54.409
You were right.
I should have stood up to him.

35:54.809 --> 35:58.250
I understand his position.
He's the boss, we gotta respect that.

35:59.010 --> 36:02.559
His job is to keep things tight.
That's a lot of pressure.

36:03.809 --> 36:06.579
You aren't changing your mind,
are you?

36:06.809 --> 36:09.719
I mean, about the wanting it all?

36:11.610 --> 36:14.590
As long as we're not
smooching on the job...

36:15.210 --> 36:19.000
...or being sucked underground
by a plant demon...

36:20.010 --> 36:21.900
...I say, why not go for it?

36:23.610 --> 36:27.230
What if we can't manage it all?
The job, the romance....

36:27.809 --> 36:29.389
Emotions are tricky.

36:29.610 --> 36:32.840
They can cloud our judgment,
like at the carousel last night.

36:33.809 --> 36:36.159
What if it doesn't work?

36:36.809 --> 36:38.630
So we're back to that?

36:41.610 --> 36:44.590
What if Wesley makes us choose?

36:51.809 --> 36:55.360
I've been fighting vamps and demons
since I was a kid.

36:56.010 --> 36:58.570
That sense of doing good...

36:59.010 --> 37:03.820
...of waking up in the morning
and making the world safer, better....

37:06.210 --> 37:07.889
I've always had that.

37:12.210 --> 37:15.050
But I never had a Fred before.

37:18.809 --> 37:21.480
If we have to, I choose you.

37:27.210 --> 37:30.619
I came on too strong, didn't I?

37:32.010 --> 37:33.550
No.

37:35.010 --> 37:37.679
You came on just right.

37:41.010 --> 37:45.719
Look, let's try not to worry too much.
Wesley's a good man.

37:46.409 --> 37:49.530
He'll do the right thing,
He always does,

38:03.090 --> 38:05.019
Come on in.

38:06.690 --> 38:09.809
I'll get you some food.
You're hungry, aren't you?

38:10.889 --> 38:13.030
Have a nice walk?

38:16.289 --> 38:18.360
How you doing?

38:21.690 --> 38:23.230
Really.

38:24.690 --> 38:27.010
I've had better days.

38:27.090 --> 38:29.440
I know the feeling.

38:30.690 --> 38:32.159
I figured it out.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.320
How I really knew about Aubrey.

38:40.289 --> 38:42.710
All that pain, that rage.

38:43.289 --> 38:48.070
Only way she could deal was
to join Holtz and take her revenge.

38:49.289 --> 38:51.500
You know how I knew that?

38:53.489 --> 38:56.230
Because you would have done the same.

39:02.489 --> 39:04.349
Scares me.

39:04.889 --> 39:06.610
You know?

39:07.289 --> 39:11.119
If anything like that happened
to Connor, I don't know what I'd....

39:14.489 --> 39:16.659
I love my son.

39:20.489 --> 39:22.840
Love can be a terrible thing.

39:22.889 --> 39:25.170
I used to think that.
I thought love...

39:25.889 --> 39:30.309
...was something that swallowed
you whole, ripped you up inside.

39:31.289 --> 39:35.710
But what I feel for Connor,
even that fear...

39:36.090 --> 39:37.909
...Wes, it's....

39:39.690 --> 39:42.010
It's not terrible.

39:45.090 --> 39:46.880
It's beautiful.

40:03.090 --> 40:05.230
What's so funny?

40:06.090 --> 40:07.420
Life.

40:07.889 --> 40:10.280
Life is funny.

40:10.889 --> 40:14.719
Listening to stupid people
talking to hamburgers is funny.

40:15.690 --> 40:18.570
Worrying about things
that will never--

40:24.090 --> 40:27.920
It's all so incredibly funny
and beautiful.

41:10.449 --> 41:12.130
Got you.

41:20.489 --> 41:22.769
Wes, get out!

41:28.889 --> 41:31.980
It's okay.
It's okay, it's all right.

41:37.289 --> 41:39.960
Earthquake, fire, blood.

41:42.090 --> 41:44.860
I thought we were gonna
be trapped in there.

41:46.289 --> 41:50.050
At least I would have had
something to snack on.
