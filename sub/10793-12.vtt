00:00.100 --> 00:03.771
<i>This is what Destiny intented from
the moment it entered the star system.</i>

00:04.872 --> 00:06.608
We are going to survive.

00:06.609 --> 00:08.745
We are going to make it home.

00:09.747 --> 00:10.880
I'm telling you,

00:10.881 --> 00:12.383
this ship came here for a reason!

00:13.085 --> 00:16.989
<i>Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.</i>

00:16.990 --> 00:19.025
He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

00:19.026 --> 00:21.831
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

00:21.832 --> 00:23.633
We just pretend nothing happened.

00:23.634 --> 00:26.470
We need to be ready for
the next encounter.

00:26.471 --> 00:27.905
For the sake of the crew.

00:28.436 --> 00:30.443
For the sake of the crew.

00:30.444 --> 00:32.580
Colonel, I'm curious about the...

00:32.581 --> 00:34.617
Incident with Dr. Rush.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.384
I managed to activate the systems

00:36.385 --> 00:37.419
on the crashed ship.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.823
Aliens showed up.

00:38.824 --> 00:40.324
Do not engage.

00:40.325 --> 00:42.227
Chloe may be onboard one
of those ships.

00:42.228 --> 00:44.331
I don't think they
did want to destroy us.

00:44.332 --> 00:46.601
What they really want is Destiny.

02:49.018 --> 02:50.287
Another nightmare?

02:52.858 --> 02:56.030
Every time I close my eyes.

02:56.031 --> 02:58.700
Maybe you should talk to TJ.

02:58.701 --> 03:01.303
No, it's not the dream, it's...

03:01.304 --> 03:02.553
What?

03:05.912 --> 03:08.481
Look, you're...

03:08.482 --> 03:10.184
They're gone, okay?

03:10.185 --> 03:12.787
We got you back,
you're safe now.

03:12.788 --> 03:14.522
So, move on?

03:14.523 --> 03:15.658
Get over it, right?

03:15.659 --> 03:18.362
That's not what I'm saying.

03:18.363 --> 03:20.767
Forget it.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.368
I want to help you.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.504
No, it's fine.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.874
I just...

03:25.875 --> 03:26.808
I just need to clear my head.

03:45.371 --> 03:48.307
Same dream?

03:48.308 --> 03:50.177
Yeah.

03:51.880 --> 03:52.720
Me too.

03:54.851 --> 03:57.655
What did they do to us?

03:57.656 --> 04:00.593
I don't remember everything.

04:00.594 --> 04:02.962
Yeah, me neither.

04:02.963 --> 04:05.332
Maybe that's a good thing.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.210
Everyone thinks we're safe.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.512
They think that

04:13.513 --> 04:16.483
they'll never find us again.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.389
We're not safe, are we?

04:22.894 --> 04:23.644
No.

04:43.666 --> 04:45.769
We need to talk.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.873
I was thinking the same thing.

04:48.175 --> 04:50.644
Were you, now?

04:50.645 --> 04:52.781
The communication stones.

04:54.918 --> 04:55.985
What about them?

04:55.986 --> 04:57.054
You took one.

04:57.055 --> 04:58.857
It's the only explanation.

04:58.858 --> 05:00.625
You were the first to open the box.

05:00.626 --> 05:01.962
You kept one for yourself.

05:01.963 --> 05:03.497
And why would I do that?

05:03.498 --> 05:04.865
Maybe you thought

05:04.866 --> 05:07.169
it was some kind of insurance policy,
I don't know.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.571
You probably thought

05:08.572 --> 05:09.973
it wasn't safe to keep in your room,

05:09.974 --> 05:10.942
especially after that whole incident

05:10.943 --> 05:12.511
with Spencer's gun.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.782
So you kept one with you.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.651
That's how the aliens got hold of one,

05:17.652 --> 05:19.955
and that's how I wound up on that ship.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.861
Oh, well.

05:23.862 --> 05:26.064
Doesn't sound like a denial, Rush.

05:26.065 --> 05:27.566
What we should really be worried about

05:27.567 --> 05:29.169
is how they found us in the first place.

05:29.170 --> 05:30.770
Well, I figure they tracked
the signal from the stone...

05:30.771 --> 05:32.307
We don't even know how
that signal works.

05:32.308 --> 05:33.709
Maybe they're smarter than us?

05:33.710 --> 05:35.278
Well, they're advanced, sure,

05:35.279 --> 05:37.749
but not as advanced as the ancients.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.251
I suspect it's something much simpler.

05:40.252 --> 05:42.055
Like what?

05:42.056 --> 05:43.790
Subspace tracking device.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.225
We took care of the ship
you brought over.

05:45.226 --> 05:47.831
Yeah, but there may be another one...

05:47.832 --> 05:50.001
Attached to the outside of the hull.

05:50.002 --> 05:53.005
Where is this coming from?

05:53.006 --> 05:56.175
I was in direct neural contact
with one of the aliens

05:56.176 --> 05:57.311
for quite some time.

05:57.312 --> 06:00.683
Ever since, I've been having...

06:00.684 --> 06:01.985
flashes...

06:01.986 --> 06:03.054
images.

06:03.055 --> 06:04.589
Of what?

06:07.795 --> 06:09.596
You don't know?

06:09.597 --> 06:10.730
No, I don't know,

06:10.731 --> 06:11.967
but what I do know is,

06:11.968 --> 06:13.302
they've been tracking this
ship for some time,

06:13.303 --> 06:15.204
long, long before we got here.

06:15.205 --> 06:17.042
For them,

06:17.043 --> 06:19.377
Destiny's something like an obsession.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.888
Look, we're out of FTL,
will be for several hours.

06:25.889 --> 06:29.627
Now's the perfect time to take a look.

06:45.017 --> 06:46.284
Kino's through.

06:49.390 --> 06:51.259
Mr. Brody,

06:51.260 --> 06:52.628
please dial back

06:52.629 --> 06:53.963
the tensile strength of the shield.

06:53.964 --> 06:56.133
Roger that.

07:20.904 --> 07:23.107
You know, it's a big ship.

07:23.108 --> 07:25.243
This could take a while.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.310
You have something better to do?

07:26.311 --> 07:29.383
Keep me posted.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.746
Can I have a word with you, Colonel?

07:48.747 --> 07:50.381
All right.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.750
Not here.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.265
I don't know exactly what happened

08:02.266 --> 08:03.367
on that planet

08:03.368 --> 08:04.769
between you and Rush,

08:04.770 --> 08:06.738
and maybe I don't want to know.

08:06.739 --> 08:08.075
Spit it out, sergeant.

08:08.076 --> 08:09.210
Well, we never did find out

08:09.211 --> 08:11.179
who put that weapon in
your quarters, sir.

08:11.180 --> 08:11.929
No.

08:12.949 --> 08:15.219
There has been some speculation.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.753
I'll bet.

08:16.754 --> 08:19.693
As far as I'm concerned,

08:19.694 --> 08:21.995
we were better off without him.

08:21.996 --> 08:23.431
I just want you to know

08:23.432 --> 08:26.134
that whatever happens...

08:26.135 --> 08:28.839
<i>Colonel Young, come in.</i>

08:28.840 --> 08:29.807
Go ahead.

08:29.808 --> 08:31.876
We've found it.

08:38.554 --> 08:41.657
It's on the underside of the ship.

08:41.658 --> 08:43.727
I just...
I fed the kino track

08:43.727 --> 08:45.296
into the shuttle controls,

08:45.297 --> 08:49.002
so it should lead you right there...

08:56.647 --> 08:58.382
Any time now, lieutenant.

08:58.383 --> 08:59.619
Yes, sir.

09:06.862 --> 09:08.264
<i>All right, guys,</i>

09:08.265 --> 09:11.435
ship's jumping to FTL in a
little over one hour.

09:11.436 --> 09:13.505
That's plenty of time.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.948
What is this place?

09:41.949 --> 09:45.720
Well, as far as I can tell,

09:45.721 --> 09:48.858
it's some kind of ancient research lab.

09:48.859 --> 09:51.095
Not exactly ideal for our purposes,

09:51.096 --> 09:53.899
but the level of connectivity
with the ship's main systems

09:53.999 --> 09:56.537
should be adequate.

09:56.538 --> 09:58.739
Do we have to do it now?

09:58.740 --> 10:01.244
We'll never get
a better opportunity.

10:03.648 --> 10:05.084
You should really get your
people in position.

10:28.953 --> 10:29.674
Eli...

10:30.956 --> 10:33.992
Hey. What are you doing here?

10:33.993 --> 10:35.629
I want to see the alien ship.

10:36.865 --> 10:38.900
You know it's just parked
there to track us.

10:38.901 --> 10:40.937
I know, but I want to see it.

10:41.939 --> 10:42.939
Come in.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.284
There it is.

10:51.654 --> 10:52.954
How long has it been on the ship?

10:52.955 --> 10:55.259
Rush says since before we got here,

10:55.260 --> 10:57.729
although it's not entirely
clear how he knows.

10:57.730 --> 10:59.898
He knows.

11:09.814 --> 11:12.150
Weapons hot...

11:12.151 --> 11:13.952
Target locked.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.756
Weapons firing.

11:34.685 --> 11:35.886
That's it.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.724
They can't get to us anymore.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.400
<i>Brody...</i>

11:46.971 --> 11:48.539
<i>Brody, where are you?</i>

11:50.443 --> 11:51.977
Hydroponics.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.012
<i>All right, stay there.</i>

11:53.013 --> 11:53.972
<i>It's on.</i>

11:55.584 --> 11:57.319
What, now?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.055
<i>You signed off on this.</i>

11:59.056 --> 12:02.359
Yeah, I know, I know.
I just...

12:02.360 --> 12:03.628
Stand by.

12:03.629 --> 12:04.963
Hey.

12:04.964 --> 12:05.714
Hi.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.468
Didn't expect to see you down here.

12:09.071 --> 12:12.375
Yeah, I just wanted to check on
some of the medicinals here.

12:12.376 --> 12:13.510
Right, sure.

12:13.511 --> 12:14.945
<i>Brody!</i>

12:14.946 --> 12:16.615
Yeah, yeah, I'll...

12:16.616 --> 12:18.484
meet up with you in about
a half an hour.

12:18.485 --> 12:19.953
Okay? Bye.

12:23.593 --> 12:24.993
That was...

12:24.994 --> 12:26.196
That was just...

12:26.197 --> 12:27.564
Volker and his...

12:27.565 --> 12:29.433
bridge club.

12:29.434 --> 12:31.437
So...

12:32.707 --> 12:34.308
Okay.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.710
Docking procedure.

13:13.034 --> 13:16.037
Sir, I'm reading a negative
on the docking clamps.

13:16.038 --> 13:17.139
Let's reset.

13:21.345 --> 13:23.549
Still negative.

13:24.718 --> 13:27.288
Eli, we've got a problem.

13:27.289 --> 13:29.157
The docking clamps will not engage.

13:29.158 --> 13:31.427
What?
That's impossible.

13:31.428 --> 13:32.696
Hang on.

13:54.396 --> 13:55.116
Eli...

14:00.504 --> 14:03.242
What the hell?

14:06.681 --> 14:08.383
I'm locked out.

14:11.655 --> 14:14.091
What do you mean you're locked out?

14:14.092 --> 14:16.461
<i>Someone's transferring controls</i>

14:16.462 --> 14:17.630
to another station.

14:17.631 --> 14:19.132
I've got nothing.

14:19.133 --> 14:23.238
Sir, the door won't open either.

14:23.239 --> 14:25.107
We're jumping to FTL in
about eight minutes.

14:25.108 --> 14:26.143
<i>What happens</i>

14:26.144 --> 14:27.612
<i>if the ship's not locked down?</i>

14:27.613 --> 14:30.683
The shield won't envelop the shuttle.

14:30.684 --> 14:32.352
And what?

14:32.353 --> 14:33.454
<i>I don't know for sure.</i>

14:33.455 --> 14:35.156
Nothing good, I know that.

14:35.157 --> 14:36.824
<i>Eli...</i>

14:36.825 --> 14:38.294
The shuttle wouldn't go into FTL

14:38.295 --> 14:39.496
with the rest of the ship.

14:39.497 --> 14:40.497
Which means what?

14:40.498 --> 14:42.400
<i>I'm not sure,</i>

14:42.401 --> 14:44.670
but I think the shuttle
would be vaporized.

14:48.543 --> 14:49.944
Seven minutes.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.084
All right...

14:56.185 --> 14:58.355
Eli, let's...
Let's think this through.

14:58.356 --> 15:01.626
You said somebody was
transferring controls?

15:01.627 --> 15:03.228
Yeah, that's what it looks
like from here.

15:03.229 --> 15:05.466
<i>Well, can you do something about it?</i>

15:07.035 --> 15:08.104
<i>Stay calm.</i>

15:08.105 --> 15:10.039
Take your time.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.541
Five minutes, sir.

15:18.519 --> 15:21.189
I'll bet you a buck.

15:21.190 --> 15:23.259
Rush, this is Young.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.661
Over.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.408
<i>Greer, this is Colonel Young.</i>

15:33.409 --> 15:34.476
Go ahead, sir.

15:34.477 --> 15:37.313
Take a detail.
Find Rush now.

15:37.314 --> 15:38.315
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

15:40.485 --> 15:42.120
Four minutes.

15:43.491 --> 15:46.093
Stop it.
Stop it now.

15:46.094 --> 15:47.228
Chloe, we've talked about this...

15:47.229 --> 15:49.165
The shuttle docking clamps
won't engage.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.299
What?

15:50.300 --> 15:51.334
You have to stop.

15:51.335 --> 15:52.803
But I can't.

15:52.804 --> 15:54.072
They're going to die.

15:54.073 --> 15:55.407
I can't stop in the middle of this.

15:55.408 --> 15:56.509
They are going to die!

15:56.510 --> 15:58.278
Dammit!

16:05.590 --> 16:07.626
Eli, this is Dr. Rush,
come in.

16:09.463 --> 16:10.597
Go ahead.

16:10.598 --> 16:11.632
<i>Now, listen carefully.</i>

16:11.633 --> 16:12.666
<i>I'm in the process</i>

16:12.667 --> 16:15.671
of transferring access to the computer

16:15.672 --> 16:17.473
away from the control interface room.

16:17.474 --> 16:20.312
<i>Now, there's nothing you can
do to stop that.</i>

16:20.313 --> 16:22.814
All you're doing is slowing it down.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.219
<i>Let me complete the transfer,</i>

16:25.220 --> 16:27.455
<i>then I'll lock down the
clamps manually.</i>

16:27.456 --> 16:29.191
Don't listen to him, Eli.

16:29.192 --> 16:31.594
<i>Keep doing what you're doing.</i>

16:31.595 --> 16:33.531
Eli, we're in no man's land here.

16:33.532 --> 16:34.800
Neither of us have control.

16:34.801 --> 16:38.271
<i>Now, let me finish before
we jump to FTL.</i>

16:38.272 --> 16:40.374
Don't do it, Eli.
That is an order.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.643
Two minutes, sir.

16:46.285 --> 16:47.786
What's going on?

16:47.787 --> 16:49.256
The shuttle can't dock,
and we're about to jump.

16:49.257 --> 16:51.658
I didn't know the transfer
would cause this to happen.

16:54.464 --> 16:56.498
Shut it down.

16:56.499 --> 16:57.734
I don't have everything yet.

16:57.735 --> 16:59.805
If I stop now,
Eli's going to shut me out,

16:59.806 --> 17:02.240
and our position will be compromised.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.452
<i>- Colonel?
- Negative.</i>

17:09.453 --> 17:11.289
Eli, do not let that man take
over a single system.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.491
He's doing it anyway.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.361
The transfer's almost complete.

17:16.564 --> 17:18.397
I know why you're doing this.

17:18.398 --> 17:20.569
I also know you agreed that
nobody should get hurt.

17:21.637 --> 17:23.906
We could lose everyone on our side.

17:23.906 --> 17:25.944
Shut it down!

17:40.500 --> 17:41.633
I got it!

17:41.634 --> 17:43.336
I got it!

17:53.385 --> 17:54.887
Let's go.

17:56.724 --> 17:58.558
Good work, Eli.

18:05.905 --> 18:07.739
So, where do we stand?

18:07.740 --> 18:09.475
How much control do we have?

18:09.476 --> 18:11.311
We're about to find out.

18:23.397 --> 18:25.599
What the hell?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.503
Come on!

18:41.558 --> 18:43.325
<i>Eli.</i>

18:43.326 --> 18:44.395
It's Rush.

18:44.396 --> 18:48.567
<i>He's sealing off corridors
all over the ship.</i>

18:50.904 --> 18:54.577
Brody, why's your radio turned off?

19:02.355 --> 19:04.291
Is there a problem?

19:07.998 --> 19:10.166
Sorry...

19:10.167 --> 19:13.137
You weren't supposed to be down here.

19:14.340 --> 19:17.077
Guys, what is it?

19:17.078 --> 19:18.947
What's happening?

19:21.818 --> 19:23.286
Get out of my way.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.754
Put the gun down.

19:24.755 --> 19:25.823
I'm not going to ask you again.

19:25.824 --> 19:27.726
Just take it easy.

19:29.062 --> 19:30.998
Airman, what are you doing?

19:30.999 --> 19:32.034
Something's going on, lieutenant.

19:32.035 --> 19:34.269
We're cut off from the
rest of the ship.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.371
I'm trying to report to the Colonel,

19:35.372 --> 19:36.740
but these people won't let me through.

19:36.941 --> 19:38.208
I'm sorry.

19:38.209 --> 19:40.344
It was inevitable that a few
people would be stuck

19:40.345 --> 19:41.947
on the wrong side of the line.

19:44.418 --> 19:45.453
What line?

19:45.454 --> 19:46.521
We've sealed off Colonel Young

19:46.522 --> 19:48.857
and most of the military personnel.

19:48.858 --> 19:50.928
To put it bluntly,

19:50.929 --> 19:53.263
we've taken the ship.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.128
Put the gun down.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.664
Not a chance.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.738
Camile, why you doing this?

20:04.739 --> 20:06.841
Colonel Young's actions
left me no choice.

20:06.842 --> 20:08.711
I'm doing this on behalf
of all the civilians

20:08.712 --> 20:10.580
onboard this ship.

20:10.581 --> 20:11.650
What do I do?

20:15.555 --> 20:17.124
Well, we're not going
to go shoot anybody.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.292
Put the gun down.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.235
Now, everyone just needs
to remain calm.

20:25.236 --> 20:27.072
This will be over soon enough.

20:33.616 --> 20:35.150
Rush, this is Young.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.220
<i>I know exactly what you're
trying to do,</i>

20:37.221 --> 20:38.589
<i>and there is no way in hell</i>

20:38.590 --> 20:40.958
<i>that I am going to let you
get away with it.</i>

20:40.959 --> 20:42.795
I'm not acting alone, Colonel.

20:42.796 --> 20:44.797
<i>Besides,</i>

20:44.798 --> 20:46.266
<i>What's done is done.</i>

20:46.267 --> 20:49.805
I already have the food and
water supplies,

20:49.806 --> 20:52.877
plus control of all accessible systems

20:52.878 --> 20:53.945
has been transferred over
to the consoles

20:53.946 --> 20:55.213
on my side of the line.

20:56.784 --> 20:58.052
What is it?

20:58.053 --> 20:58.892
That...

21:00.390 --> 21:02.325
That's not entirely true.

21:02.326 --> 21:03.993
He stopped the transfer prematurely

21:03.994 --> 21:05.963
so I could lock down the shuttle,

21:05.964 --> 21:07.599
which saved your lives, by the way...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.635
Moving on...

21:09.636 --> 21:12.840
That left us control with
one key system...

21:12.841 --> 21:14.843
Life support.

21:14.844 --> 21:16.278
So you mean that we can shut
down the heat and air

21:16.279 --> 21:18.949
on the other side whenever we want?

21:18.950 --> 21:20.751
We wouldn't do that.

21:20.752 --> 21:22.121
Do you have any idea

21:22.122 --> 21:23.290
what's going on here?

21:23.291 --> 21:24.040
No.

21:25.226 --> 21:26.795
As a matter of fact, I don't.

21:26.796 --> 21:29.198
Am I the only one?

21:29.199 --> 21:30.166
You've got our attention.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.070
<i>What do you want?</i>

21:32.071 --> 21:33.671
All military personnel

21:33.672 --> 21:35.374
to hand over their weapons immediately

21:35.375 --> 21:38.412
and submit to civilian authority.

21:40.249 --> 21:42.084
Is that it?

21:42.085 --> 21:43.954
Well, it does tend to be

21:43.955 --> 21:46.890
how civilized people structure
their societies, Colonel,

21:46.891 --> 21:49.229
be that as in nations

21:49.230 --> 21:50.897
or in microcosm.

21:50.898 --> 21:53.068
As opposed to what?

21:53.069 --> 21:54.236
<i>Military dictatorship.</i>

21:54.237 --> 21:56.839
That's got to stop.

21:58.243 --> 21:59.977
Well, Eli tells me there
might be a problem

21:59.978 --> 22:01.414
with your plan.

22:01.415 --> 22:03.250
<i>Something to do with life support.</i>

22:08.291 --> 22:10.727
I was hoping that he wouldn't
notice that.

22:10.728 --> 22:12.997
<i>Anyway, I've done the calculations.</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:16.236
We're occupying a much larger area,

22:16.237 --> 22:19.040
therefore we have a greater
volume of air.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.343
<i>Plus we have the hydroponics lab</i>

22:21.344 --> 22:24.047
<i>producing some oxygen.</i>

22:24.048 --> 22:25.816
Not enough to make a difference.

22:27.419 --> 22:30.223
If you cut us off right now,

22:30.224 --> 22:31.858
we'd have at least three days,

22:31.859 --> 22:33.529
<i>which is around about the
same amount of time</i>

22:33.530 --> 22:35.364
<i>you would have to go without water.</i>

22:35.365 --> 22:38.469
<i>If it comes down to a contest...</i>

22:38.470 --> 22:41.807
Well, I'm not sure what the
final outcome would be,

22:41.808 --> 22:44.444
but it wouldn't be pretty.

22:44.445 --> 22:46.181
It's not pretty now.

22:46.182 --> 22:48.918
Sergeant...

23:03.841 --> 23:05.944
What did he say?

23:05.945 --> 23:07.546
Nothing,

23:07.547 --> 23:09.416
But they're still pumping air in here.

23:09.417 --> 23:10.517
He'll give in.

23:10.518 --> 23:12.253
He's got no choice.

23:12.254 --> 23:14.823
We have the gate room and
the communication room.

23:14.824 --> 23:17.194
He's completely cut off.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.463
Yeah, but he still has one thing

23:18.464 --> 23:19.864
that might make a difference.

23:24.906 --> 23:27.075
Come on, buddy, you got this.

23:27.076 --> 23:30.181
It's a very complicated lock-out
program, okay?

23:30.182 --> 23:32.150
I'm going to need some time.

23:32.151 --> 23:33.619
So, I got a head count.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.155
Lieutenant Johansen and Airman Dunning

23:35.156 --> 23:37.190
are unaccounted for,

23:37.191 --> 23:39.795
So I think we can assume that
they are on the other side.

23:39.796 --> 23:41.229
Of course,

23:41.230 --> 23:43.100
just because someone's on
the other side,

23:43.101 --> 23:44.836
doesn't necessarily mean they're,

23:44.837 --> 23:47.873
you know, on the other side.

23:47.874 --> 23:49.176
Obviously not.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.344
We've got half a dozen civilians,

23:50.345 --> 23:52.213
all of which claim to know nothing.

23:52.214 --> 23:54.116
What about Chloe?

23:54.117 --> 23:56.120
She's with them.

23:57.622 --> 23:58.957
Like I said...

23:58.958 --> 24:00.058
How's it coming?

24:01.628 --> 24:03.196
Slowly,

24:03.197 --> 24:05.934
and it doesn't help that I'm
starting to get hungry.

24:05.935 --> 24:07.068
Low blood sugar is not my friend.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.070
It's not the food that I'm
worried about.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.307
It's the water.

24:09.308 --> 24:10.575
If dehydration sets in,

24:10.576 --> 24:11.676
we're going to be in a lot of trouble.

24:11.677 --> 24:12.777
Is there anything we can do about it?

24:12.778 --> 24:14.114
They've offered a trade.

24:14.115 --> 24:15.882
A limited amount of food and water

24:15.883 --> 24:18.753
in exchange for Eli.

24:21.191 --> 24:22.292
Me?

24:22.293 --> 24:23.627
I've already agreed to it.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.663
Sir, he's the only one who can
get us around

24:25.664 --> 24:27.633
whatever Rush did to those computers.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.801
I know that,
and they know that,

24:28.802 --> 24:30.003
and that's why they want Eli,

24:30.004 --> 24:32.340
but there is another way in.

24:37.916 --> 24:41.320
All right, guys, I'm here,

24:41.321 --> 24:42.370
and as you can see...

24:46.763 --> 24:49.667
I am alone.

24:51.103 --> 24:53.839
Open the door.

24:55.776 --> 24:56.810
Whoa!

24:56.811 --> 24:57.531
Irony.

24:59.315 --> 25:01.384
Put it down.

25:01.385 --> 25:02.653
Come on.

25:15.273 --> 25:16.523
So...

25:18.076 --> 25:20.880
Here we are.

25:23.117 --> 25:24.319
I can't help but notice

25:24.320 --> 25:25.754
that you seem to be,

25:25.755 --> 25:28.225
well, working with these people.

25:28.226 --> 25:30.862
What did you think,
I was a prisoner?

25:30.863 --> 25:34.366
I was hoping they...

25:34.367 --> 25:35.902
Wait a minute.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.109
In the control room,

25:40.110 --> 25:41.812
when you came by,

25:41.813 --> 25:45.316
were you just trying to distract me?

25:45.317 --> 25:47.119
So that I wouldn't notice
what Rush was doing?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.053
What?

25:48.054 --> 25:50.359
Don't "what" me...

25:50.360 --> 25:51.393
No...

25:51.394 --> 25:54.831
Of course not.

25:54.832 --> 25:58.736
Look, I knew it was coming,
but I didn't know when.

26:02.777 --> 26:03.978
Believe me or don't believe me.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.314
It doesn't matter.

26:05.315 --> 26:06.415
I guess...

26:06.416 --> 26:09.419
I'm just a little surprised

26:09.420 --> 26:12.491
you're taking Rush's side
against Young.

26:12.492 --> 26:14.961
Rush was an inconvenience,

26:14.962 --> 26:17.832
so Colonel Young left him
on that planet to die.

26:17.833 --> 26:19.034
Deliberately.

26:39.533 --> 26:41.802
The hole the aliens cut in the hull

26:41.803 --> 26:42.837
is on the other side of the line,

26:42.838 --> 26:44.105
on their six.

26:44.106 --> 26:45.206
Suit up.

26:48.179 --> 26:49.279
Sir...

26:49.280 --> 26:50.547
Lieutenant, I already told you,

26:50.548 --> 26:54.254
I want you here in case
it doesn't work.

27:08.042 --> 27:09.343
We shouldn't have given them
food and water.

27:09.344 --> 27:11.046
It's just going to give them more time.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.281
That doesn't matter.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.850
They know they've got no choice.

27:13.851 --> 27:15.118
Why don't they just
give it up, then?

27:18.425 --> 27:20.126
He's a full bird Colonel

27:20.127 --> 27:22.563
in the United States Air Force.

27:22.564 --> 27:25.900
He's used to getting his way,

27:25.901 --> 27:27.570
but he also knows

27:27.571 --> 27:30.241
that every military in the free world

27:30.242 --> 27:34.213
takes orders from a civilian government.

27:34.214 --> 27:38.420
We just need to stick together
until he remembers that.

27:47.034 --> 27:49.437
I'll leave you to it.

27:49.438 --> 27:50.397
To what?

27:52.208 --> 27:53.443
Once again, Eli,

27:53.444 --> 27:56.046
I find myself in need of
your assistance.

27:57.383 --> 27:59.051
What exactly are you doing?

27:59.552 --> 28:03.591
We are going to squeeze every
last ounce of power

28:03.592 --> 28:05.159
out of the ship's systems,

28:05.160 --> 28:06.428
and then when we're done,

28:06.429 --> 28:08.599
we're going to find some more.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.102
What for?

28:11.103 --> 28:12.171
The shields.

28:12.172 --> 28:15.508
We're going to need them.

28:33.697 --> 28:36.364
The tracking device was on that
ship that we blew up.

28:37.167 --> 28:39.136
One tracking device was on that ship.

28:39.637 --> 28:41.004
There's another one?

28:42.609 --> 28:45.712
Surgically implanted in my chest,

28:45.713 --> 28:47.850
next to my heart.

28:56.630 --> 28:57.831
<i>Colonel...</i>

29:02.306 --> 29:03.473
<i>We got to go.</i>

29:08.115 --> 29:09.548
This is insane!

29:09.549 --> 29:12.321
Does anyone else know about this?

29:12.322 --> 29:13.789
Chloe.

29:13.790 --> 29:15.591
I had to be sure she wasn't
implanted too.

29:15.592 --> 29:17.295
And?

29:17.296 --> 29:19.230
There's no surgical scar.

29:21.334 --> 29:22.568
They're almost within weapons range.

29:22.569 --> 29:24.571
I'm dialing up the shield.

29:24.572 --> 29:26.508
Wait!

29:27.611 --> 29:28.711
Maybe...

29:28.712 --> 29:32.984
Maybe that's the wrong plan.

29:32.985 --> 29:34.987
I mean, maybe we should

29:34.988 --> 29:37.057
throw everything we have into weapons.

29:37.058 --> 29:40.128
We can't take on three ships at once.

29:40.129 --> 29:41.697
Well, we can't run away
from them either.

29:41.698 --> 29:44.468
That's exactly why I have to do this.

29:44.469 --> 29:47.505
If we can survive until the next jump,

29:47.506 --> 29:49.710
they're going to realize they
can't get past the shields,

29:49.711 --> 29:50.777
and they're going to give up.

29:50.778 --> 29:52.480
You don't know that.

29:52.481 --> 29:54.016
That's the way it's been for
a long time, Eli.

29:54.017 --> 29:56.151
They attack, they try
and get onboard.

29:56.152 --> 29:57.654
The ship'sautomated defenses

29:57.655 --> 29:59.690
stop them.

29:59.691 --> 30:01.126
They're attacking us now

30:01.127 --> 30:04.698
because they're hoping we're
going to make a mistake.

30:04.699 --> 30:05.419
Don't!

30:07.169 --> 30:08.003
Eli, do you want to die?

30:08.004 --> 30:09.038
No, but...

30:09.039 --> 30:10.574
That's exactly what's going to happen

30:10.575 --> 30:12.309
if you don't let me do this.

30:18.755 --> 30:20.722
No...

30:24.295 --> 30:26.196
What's the matter with you?

30:26.197 --> 30:27.366
Right.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.435
What?

30:28.436 --> 30:29.503
Sure.

30:47.196 --> 30:49.299
You'll open the door for Scott
and his team,

30:49.300 --> 30:50.434
and I'll go find Rush.

30:54.408 --> 30:56.342
I just wanted to see if there's
anything you need.

30:56.343 --> 30:58.012
You can let us out of here.

30:58.013 --> 30:59.347
Don't worry,

30:59.348 --> 31:00.782
you won't have to stay in here
for much longer.

31:00.783 --> 31:02.385
I know, because the Colonel's
going to take back the ship.

31:02.386 --> 31:04.555
You don't have any idea what
you're up against.

31:04.556 --> 31:06.458
I think we do.

31:06.459 --> 31:07.760
Not a clue.

31:07.761 --> 31:09.463
Sorry, but a bunch of civilians

31:09.464 --> 31:10.864
up against the Colonel's training

31:10.865 --> 31:12.800
and experience?

31:12.801 --> 31:14.169
It's about listening to reason.

31:14.170 --> 31:15.805
Not once you took the ship.

31:15.806 --> 31:17.341
That made it war,

31:17.342 --> 31:19.711
and that's what we do.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.647
It's not going to make life on
this ship any easier,

31:21.648 --> 31:23.115
and it's not going to make what
those aliens did to you

31:23.116 --> 31:24.486
any better.

31:24.487 --> 31:26.187
Neither will anything you could
possibly say to me.

31:30.863 --> 31:33.232
What was that?

31:33.233 --> 31:34.300
They're back.

31:37.171 --> 31:38.772
What's happening?

31:38.773 --> 31:40.575
Stay here.

31:40.576 --> 31:42.211
This is Wray.
Report.

31:51.393 --> 31:53.294
We've got company.

31:53.295 --> 31:54.830
So I figured.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.367
Let's go.

31:58.970 --> 32:00.052
Sergeant?

32:02.543 --> 32:03.709
They're fine.

32:03.710 --> 32:05.246
I went easy on 'em.

32:09.922 --> 32:11.188
That's it.

32:11.189 --> 32:12.691
That's all the power we're
going to get.

32:17.566 --> 32:19.401
The shields are holding.

32:19.402 --> 32:20.770
Listen up.

32:20.771 --> 32:22.306
If you have to use force,
so be it,

32:22.307 --> 32:24.542
but we still have to live with
these people tomorrow.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.278
Remember that.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.413
Go.

32:27.414 --> 32:28.547
Yes, sir.

32:31.954 --> 32:33.422
What is going on?

32:33.423 --> 32:35.292
They found us again.

32:35.293 --> 32:36.894
How?

32:42.736 --> 32:43.971
We knew this was coming.

32:43.972 --> 32:45.473
We're prepared.

32:45.474 --> 32:46.575
Who's we?

32:47.979 --> 32:50.448
I know Rush is the only
person on this ship

32:50.449 --> 32:52.584
who has any idea what
you've been through,

32:52.585 --> 32:55.822
but it doesn't mean that you
can trust him.

32:55.823 --> 32:57.291
He saved my life

32:57.292 --> 32:59.661
when Colonel Young was ready
to sacrifice us both.

32:59.662 --> 33:01.064
We can't afford to have a majority vote

33:01.065 --> 33:03.767
every time a decision needs
to be made, Chloe.

33:03.768 --> 33:05.671
We need a leader.

33:05.672 --> 33:07.573
Chloe?

33:12.649 --> 33:13.782
All right, put the gun down.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.884
You guys okay?

33:14.885 --> 33:16.453
Yeah, we're fine.

33:16.454 --> 33:19.491
All right, come on, let's go.

33:25.735 --> 33:27.804
You were surgically implanted

33:27.805 --> 33:29.406
with a tracking device.

33:29.407 --> 33:32.444
Is that what this was all about?

33:32.445 --> 33:34.312
You thought if Young was in
command he'd, what,

33:34.313 --> 33:36.384
throw you out of an airlock?

33:36.385 --> 33:37.886
Given my previous experience,

33:37.887 --> 33:39.821
it's hardly an unreasonable assumption,

33:39.822 --> 33:43.093
and, remember, this was your idea.

33:43.094 --> 33:44.929
Doesn't matter whose idea it was.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.965
It's over.

33:52.975 --> 33:53.976
Everybody down, now!

33:53.977 --> 33:55.779
On the floor!

33:55.780 --> 33:56.680
Now!

33:56.681 --> 33:57.514
Get down!

33:57.515 --> 33:59.517
I said get down!

33:59.518 --> 34:00.820
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

34:00.821 --> 34:04.092
Just...
Wait.

34:04.093 --> 34:05.828
Greer...

34:16.946 --> 34:18.780
Get the weapons online.

34:20.049 --> 34:21.618
He can't.

34:21.619 --> 34:22.719
Why?

34:22.719 --> 34:24.589
I created a separate lock-out
code for that system.

34:24.590 --> 34:25.590
Give him the code.

34:25.591 --> 34:26.625
No.

34:26.626 --> 34:27.860
We're under attack.

34:27.862 --> 34:29.362
I know.
The best form of defense

34:29.364 --> 34:31.400
is to devote all of our power
to the shields.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.734
That's not your decision to make.

34:32.735 --> 34:34.304
It's already been done.

34:34.304 --> 34:35.572
Really?

34:35.572 --> 34:37.708
Well, maybe I should just
shoot you right now.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.149
Colonel?

34:51.025 --> 34:52.527
Get 'em out of here.

34:53.329 --> 34:54.196
Wait!

34:54.197 --> 34:56.199
He has a transmitter implanted
in his chest.

34:56.201 --> 34:57.602
That's how they've been following us.

34:57.603 --> 34:59.504
Even if we survive to the next jump,

34:59.505 --> 35:02.309
they'll just track us again.

35:08.185 --> 35:09.320
TJ, take care of it.

35:10.522 --> 35:11.556
What?

35:11.557 --> 35:12.958
Cut it out.

35:12.959 --> 35:13.893
I can't just go

35:13.894 --> 35:15.227
digging around in his chest.

35:15.228 --> 35:16.530
She's not qualified for this.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.367
We'll use the stones.
We'll get someone who is...

35:18.368 --> 35:19.968
We're not equipped for this.
Are you crazy? This is insane!

35:19.969 --> 35:21.805
You know...

35:21.806 --> 35:23.874
That we've got to get that
transmitter out.

35:23.875 --> 35:26.010
Sir, I don't recommend

35:26.011 --> 35:28.581
giving up any military personnel
at this particular moment.

35:28.582 --> 35:31.920
I'll do it.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.158
I don't need to know what I'm doing.

35:35.159 --> 35:36.994
It won't be me, right?

35:52.418 --> 35:55.755
TJ, this is Dr. Brightman.

35:56.323 --> 35:56.992
Lieutenant.

35:56.993 --> 35:59.394
Thank you.

35:59.395 --> 36:00.762
What did you give him?

36:00.763 --> 36:03.901
An anesthetic I made from the
venom of a creature

36:03.902 --> 36:05.269
we ran into a while back.

36:05.270 --> 36:07.740
In low doses,
it'll knock you out pretty good.

36:07.741 --> 36:11.045
You gave him alien venom?
Is that safe?

36:11.046 --> 36:12.314
Well, without it,
we'd all be dead right now.

36:12.315 --> 36:14.116
Okay.

36:14.117 --> 36:16.719
I thought at first we were
going to have to go in blind,

36:16.720 --> 36:18.823
but then Eli,
he's one of our people,

36:18.824 --> 36:20.760
came up with this.

36:20.761 --> 36:22.162
It's a camera.

36:22.163 --> 36:23.197
He took it out of a kino.

36:23.198 --> 36:24.232
What's a...?

36:24.233 --> 36:25.867
It's like a video transmitter.

36:25.868 --> 36:29.739
Anyway, we took it apart and
mounted it on that,

36:29.740 --> 36:33.479
and that way we can go in
arthroscopically.

36:35.382 --> 36:36.850
What is that?

36:36.851 --> 36:38.553
Yeah, we're under attack.

36:38.554 --> 36:39.654
What?

36:39.655 --> 36:41.490
Shields are holding.
We're good.

36:42.927 --> 36:44.094
Welcome to Destiny.

36:48.769 --> 36:50.271
All right, that's it.

36:50.272 --> 36:52.808
That's it?
We got weapons?

36:52.809 --> 36:53.909
I found a way around the lock-out,
but think...

36:53.910 --> 36:55.144
What?

36:55.145 --> 36:57.815
I think Rush might be right
about this one.

36:57.816 --> 36:58.985
If I'm reading this correctly,

36:58.986 --> 37:00.853
the shields can't take much more.

37:00.854 --> 37:03.057
All the more reason to shoot back.

37:03.058 --> 37:04.759
We can't spare the power.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.960
Weaken the shields,
even a little,

37:05.961 --> 37:07.530
and I think they might
collapse completely.

37:07.531 --> 37:08.465
Well, that's what's going to
happen anyway, isn't it?

37:08.466 --> 37:10.000
Yes,

37:10.001 --> 37:11.267
but maybe, if we're lucky,
not before we jump.

37:11.268 --> 37:12.371
Maybe?

37:12.372 --> 37:13.239
Yeah.

37:29.030 --> 37:30.398
You got something I can hold
this open with?

37:30.399 --> 37:32.299
Thank you.

37:36.106 --> 37:39.111
Lieutenant, can you hold that, please?

37:39.112 --> 37:40.513
Thank you.
Hold it up.

37:40.514 --> 37:41.713
Thank you.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.185
Okay...

38:06.186 --> 38:07.985
Okay, I see it.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.363
Getting it out's going to be
a bit tricky, but...

38:14.364 --> 38:16.600
Are you okay?

38:18.405 --> 38:20.005
Oh, God!

38:20.006 --> 38:21.942
Oh, my God!

38:21.943 --> 38:23.043
Chloe?

38:23.044 --> 38:24.245
Eli, this is Scott.

38:24.246 --> 38:25.246
We just lost the connection.

38:25.247 --> 38:26.582
What the heck is going on down there?

38:26.583 --> 38:27.617
<i>Say again?</i>

38:27.618 --> 38:28.886
We've lost the connection.

38:28.887 --> 38:31.389
<i>The doctor is gone.</i>

38:31.390 --> 38:33.926
Maybe-maybe there's too
much interference

38:33.927 --> 38:35.061
with all the enemy fire
on the shields?

38:35.062 --> 38:36.296
Fix it.

38:36.297 --> 38:38.165
What?
I'm guessing as it is!

38:39.971 --> 38:41.304
Sorry, you're on your own.

38:41.305 --> 38:43.206
<i>TJ, you get that thing out of him.</i>

38:43.207 --> 38:44.543
Shields aren't going to last
much longer.

38:44.544 --> 38:45.944
There's nothing I can do.

38:45.945 --> 38:47.079
How long till we jump?

38:47.080 --> 38:47.946
Just over a minute.

38:49.317 --> 38:50.651
TJ...

38:50.652 --> 38:51.919
You get that thing out of him right now,

38:51.920 --> 38:53.322
or I'm going to have to!

38:53.323 --> 38:54.358
He's coming to!

38:54.359 --> 38:55.959
Hold him down,
hold him down!

38:55.960 --> 38:57.328
Give him another dose of anesthetic.

38:57.329 --> 38:59.498
What are you doing to me?

38:59.499 --> 39:00.599
Hold him steady,
hold him steady...

39:09.214 --> 39:10.649
Okay, I can see it.

39:10.650 --> 39:11.950
Chloe...

39:11.951 --> 39:13.385
I need you to hold this.

39:18.294 --> 39:20.530
Okay...

39:21.566 --> 39:23.233
There it is.

39:25.104 --> 39:27.206
Okay...

39:27.207 --> 39:28.241
All right, I got it.

39:28.242 --> 39:31.413
Now pull it out.

39:42.530 --> 39:45.067
I got it.
Give it here.

39:53.579 --> 39:55.048
We got it.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.692
Shields are barely registering!

40:10.439 --> 40:12.174
We're jumping!

40:26.130 --> 40:28.464
Okay, we can close him up.

40:28.465 --> 40:29.466
Nice work.

40:44.289 --> 40:45.490
How'd we do, sir?

40:45.491 --> 40:47.227
Well, the ship's taken some damage.

40:47.228 --> 40:48.395
Eli's looking into it.

40:48.396 --> 40:50.632
Anyway, we're still here.

40:50.633 --> 40:53.302
All right, everyone,

40:53.303 --> 40:57.442
I need all of you to head back
into your quarters now.

40:59.779 --> 41:01.315
Everyone.

41:01.316 --> 41:02.683
Sir, we can't guard 'em all

41:02.684 --> 41:04.151
if we let them split up.

41:04.152 --> 41:07.223
It's over, sergeant.

41:07.224 --> 41:08.825
All right, people,

41:08.826 --> 41:10.528
you heard the man.

41:10.529 --> 41:12.765
Let's go!

41:40.141 --> 41:41.442
So...

41:41.443 --> 41:43.177
I'm open to suggestions.

41:43.378 --> 41:46.048
Obviously, we need to find
a way to work together.

41:46.449 --> 41:49.185
Pretend it never happened, you mean.

41:50.289 --> 41:51.957
