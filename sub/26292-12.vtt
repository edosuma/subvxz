WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.354
- Previously,
on "New Amsterdam"...

00:06.397 --> 00:08.008
- Dr. Bloom.
- Dr. Bloom?

00:08.051 --> 00:09.531
- The last few weeks,
I've been taking

00:09.574 --> 00:12.099
a little bit more Adderall
than prescribed.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.188
- I think you may need help.
- I'm just tired--

00:14.231 --> 00:16.581
- Mr. Powell could have died.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.152
- Run the
Cardiac Surgical Department.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.414
- There is no
Cardiac Surgical Department.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.112
- Then build one.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.070
- When we aim high-energy
external beam radiation

00:27.114 --> 00:28.506
at the cancer in your throat,

00:28.550 --> 00:30.421
if you move then, you die.

00:30.465 --> 00:33.076
- I don't want everyone
to see me so weak.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.469
- The answer's yes, Max.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.732
I'll be your deputy.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.049
I don't even know

00:49.092 --> 00:50.441
what some of this
stuff is.

00:50.485 --> 00:53.749
Babe, I-I didn't know we had
so many friends.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.533
This is a return, right?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.231
- No way.
- No?

00:57.274 --> 00:58.710
- Cloth diapers are way better
for the environment.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.538
- Yeah, but disposable diapers
are way better

01:00.582 --> 01:02.236
for sleeping in on Sunday.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.542
- Fine, maybe pile.
- Maybe pile.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.328
It's very cute that you think
you're sleeping in on Sundays.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.416
- Yeah.

01:08.459 --> 01:09.808
Electric snot sucker?
Return.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.462
- How do you suggest
we remove snot

01:11.506 --> 01:12.724
from our baby's nasal passages?

01:12.768 --> 01:14.204
- The old-fashioned way.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.379
You put your mouth on that nose
and you...

01:15.423 --> 01:16.598
- That's disgusting!

01:16.641 --> 01:19.253
Keeping.
- Babe, I'm just saying...

01:20.689 --> 01:24.388
What about a baby--
a baby blender?

01:24.432 --> 01:25.824
- That's a maybe.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.391
I mean, we don't have
an adult blender.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.871
- All right, well,
the Swedish here says, uh...

01:32.570 --> 01:34.224
- Oh, well, in that case...

01:34.268 --> 01:35.573
- Mm.
- Return.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.227
- Return. Yeah.

01:41.710 --> 01:44.104
- Oh, babe, more nausea?

01:44.147 --> 01:46.889
- Mm.
Mm-hmm.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.586
- Hey, I thought Helen said

01:48.630 --> 01:51.676
that you wouldn't experience
chemo nausea so soon.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.636
- Well, maybe I'm, uh...

01:56.551 --> 01:57.726
Maybe I'm special.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.424
- Maybe you should stay home.

02:00.468 --> 02:03.384
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-mm.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.125
I'm good.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.561
I'm already over it.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.171
It's fine.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.694
I'm raring to go.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.783
I'm not gonna let
a little cancer slow me down.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.524
I'm fine.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.266
- Ow!

02:19.661 --> 02:21.184
â™ª Yeah

02:21.228 --> 02:22.925
How can I help?

02:22.968 --> 02:24.666
- Figured out why the old
Cardio Department lost its way:

02:24.709 --> 02:26.450
Our conflict
of interest policy.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.191
- What's wrong with it?
- Well, we don't have one.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.540
Big pharma could buy me
an island,

02:29.584 --> 02:31.455
and no one would know.
- Could be fun.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.283
- We should mandate
total transparency.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.676
- Uh, how many other hospitals
do this?

02:34.719 --> 02:36.808
- Zero.
- I guess we'll be the first.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.419
- In clinical trials,

02:38.462 --> 02:39.855
do you know what you want
in ideal candidates?

02:39.898 --> 02:41.378
- Ooh, I know this one.
Sick people?

02:41.422 --> 02:42.771
- Diversity.
- Yeah.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.599
- Our candidates need
to be as diverse

02:44.642 --> 02:46.209
as the country
we're aiming to treat.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.820
- Yeah, so what's the problem?

02:48.864 --> 02:52.215
- The country I'm trying
to treat isn't Finland.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.217
- Hmm.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.871
I can see that.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
Yeah.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.222
I'll make some calls.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.789
- More glitter, right?
Okay, yes.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.487
So New York has seen a spike
in Polynesian refugees

03:03.531 --> 03:05.228
because their countries are,
you know,

03:05.272 --> 03:06.838
sinking into the Pacific Ocean.
- Right.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.666
- Not a lot of them
speak English--

03:08.710 --> 03:10.842
like these little cuties right
here from Tuvalu, aren't you?

03:10.886 --> 03:12.279
- Imagine I just said
"how can I help?" in Tuvaluan.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.715
- I wish I could, but I can't,

03:13.758 --> 03:15.543
because nobody speaks Tuvaluan
in New York--

03:15.586 --> 03:16.848
literally,
like, less than 20 people.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.328
I need a translator.

03:18.372 --> 03:21.288
- Oh, okay.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.854
So I just learned the word
for "potty."

03:22.898 --> 03:24.682
- Oh, did you?
- But I'm gonna take off.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.816
- Okay.
Oh, oh. Gladys!

03:27.859 --> 03:30.471
- My department
was just flagged by HCC

03:30.514 --> 03:32.560
for "disproportionately
providing coverage

03:32.603 --> 03:36.259
to patients ineligible
for Medicaid and for--"

03:36.303 --> 03:37.695
- Solved.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.001
Thought that was gonna go in.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.481
Still solved.
Pretend it went in.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.222
- But they said they would
cap my budget--

03:42.265 --> 03:43.745
- It doesn't matter.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.355
We treat everybody here,
and if they're not covered,

03:45.399 --> 03:46.487
if they're covered,
it doesn't matter.

03:46.530 --> 03:47.749
The price...

03:47.792 --> 03:49.403
We treat everyone.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.231
That's the power
of New Amsterdam.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.233
Excuse me.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.367
- Max, are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.674
- Ooh.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.980
Max, you want us
to wait for you?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.639
Oh, God, what is
the medical term

04:08.683 --> 04:10.032
for "barfed my face off"?

04:10.075 --> 04:11.947
- This isn't a great time.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.557
- You don't even know
what just came out of me.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.299
I'm not just talking quantity,
I'm talking quality.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.302
I mean, what the heck
could I have possibly eaten--

04:19.346 --> 04:21.478
- Max.
- What?

04:23.611 --> 04:26.048
- This is a consortium
of top oncologists

04:26.091 --> 04:29.747
being hosted
by a WHO facility in Haiti.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.924
Everyone, this is Dr. Goodwin,
our Medical Director.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.318
How you doing?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.711
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.930
- Let's pick this up
in 15, shall we?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.412
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.371
I'm consulting
on a very challenging case.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.329
A digression about the texture
of your vomit

04:46.373 --> 04:48.331
was just the mood-lightener
that we needed.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.899
- I'm happy to help.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.336
- And you need
anti-nausea meds.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.382
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.516
This is harder than I thought.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.431
- Silver lining?

05:01.475 --> 05:03.085
When we start radiation
tonight,

05:03.128 --> 05:05.914
your throat's gonna be too sore
to eat anything.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.002
- Mm.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.960
- Less nausea.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.444
- So you'd walk by,
and you'd see all this smoke

05:14.488 --> 05:16.316
seeping out
from under the door.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.795
But it wasn't a fire.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.928
It was the cardiologists'
smoking lounge.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.059
- In the hospital?

05:21.103 --> 05:22.931
- Yes, Building C.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.802
- Third floor.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.978
They had the fire department
called on them

05:27.022 --> 05:28.806
at least twice a month.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.678
- I can't believe you've never
told me that one before.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.375
- It was a different time.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.985
It's just a wonder
more patients didn't die.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.465
- Yeah, no kidding--oh.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.075
No, it's okay.
It's okay, I got it.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.816
No, no, no, I got it.
Henry, it's cool.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.383
- Thanks.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.516
- I've been trained
for such situations.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.344
- Just got to get
the big chunks, right?

05:44.387 --> 05:45.519
- Yeah...
- Thanks.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.694
- Kick the rest
under the table.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.565
Clumsy.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.480
- You know, my, uh--

05:50.524 --> 05:53.570
my intern days
were totally tame.

05:53.614 --> 05:56.051
I-I don't have any
crazy stories, you know.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.619
- Oh, don't be so sure.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.447
Those memories
will come flooding back

06:00.490 --> 06:01.926
once you're my age.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.798
For example, I have
a temporal bone surgery

06:03.841 --> 06:04.842
scheduled tomorrow.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.104
Now, back in the day,

06:06.148 --> 06:07.889
we wouldn't even
consider operating

06:07.932 --> 06:09.630
until we could see
discoloration

06:09.673 --> 06:11.980
in the neck and the jawline.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.721
- Oh.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.549
That's crazy.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.690
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.170
Lauren.
- I'm late.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.564
- Lauren...

06:30.607 --> 06:32.870
I am deeply sorry.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.132
If you would just
hear me out--

06:34.176 --> 06:36.700
- You rooted through my bag
for drugs

06:36.744 --> 06:39.790
after I explicitly told you
that I was clean.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.531
You just couldn't trust me,
could you?

06:41.575 --> 06:44.795
- It's not that simple,
and you know it.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.710
I was concerned.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.669
I overstepped.
What I wanted--

06:48.712 --> 06:50.105
- We were friends.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.802
- We still are.
- How?

06:53.935 --> 06:55.980
- You asked for help.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.982
You admitted you needed help.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.680
Let me help you.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.159
- How about this?

07:01.203 --> 07:03.597
From now on, you stay
on your side of the hospital.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.642
I'll stay on mine.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.083
- Oh, hi.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.133
Max?

07:18.176 --> 07:20.091
Hey, Dora told me
I could find you in here.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.442
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.573
- Uh...

07:23.617 --> 07:25.488
that's all right.
I can wait.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.577
- Oh...

07:32.582 --> 07:35.585
- Hey.
- How can I...

07:35.629 --> 07:37.239
- Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I got it.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.502
So, um, let's say,
hypothetically,

07:39.546 --> 07:41.112
I have a friend here
at the hospital.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.593
Let's call him, uh,
Dr. Dre.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.073
- Mm.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.684
- And, uh, what if he kind of,
sort of maybe...

07:47.728 --> 07:51.166
shouldn't probably be
performing surgeries anymore?

07:51.209 --> 07:53.821
- We're not having
an unofficial conversation

07:53.864 --> 07:55.910
about an impaired
physician, Iggy.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.825
We have a system.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.783
- I know.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.003
I just don't want to ruin
anyone's career, you know?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.657
- Well, if you're
concerned enough

08:03.700 --> 08:06.790
to bring it to me here,
then it has to be official.

08:06.834 --> 08:07.922
All right?

08:07.965 --> 08:09.837
No half reports,
no pseudonyms.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.882
By the way,
maybe pick a better one.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.623
- I know.
- Just tell me what's going on

08:13.667 --> 08:15.625
so I can investigate
the doctor properly.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.628
- Come on, man. Can't we just
hypothesize about it

08:18.672 --> 08:20.151
for a little while longer?

08:20.195 --> 08:24.112
- Iggy, your name will be
kept confidential, I swear.

08:28.203 --> 08:31.075
It's Dr. Maravich.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.816
- What's going on?

08:32.860 --> 08:34.862
- AyÃºdennos, por favor!

08:34.905 --> 08:36.690
El estÃ¡ enfermo!

08:36.733 --> 08:38.518
- Do--do you speak English?
- Yes, yes, yes!

08:38.561 --> 08:39.823
Please, you have to help him!
He needs help!

08:39.867 --> 08:41.608
- Severe dehydration.

08:41.651 --> 08:42.957
- Okay, let's get him over
to Bay 27 for a workup.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.872
What's your name?
- Ivan Velez.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.048
- Ivan, how do you know him?
- Uh, Miguel, we are brothers.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.092
You must help him, please!
- He feels hot.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.703
Ivan, look at me.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.008
How long has he been
sick like this?

08:51.052 --> 08:52.183
- Uh, about a week.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.576
He started shivering, and he--

08:53.620 --> 08:55.012
he couldn't, uh, drink
or eat anything.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.581
We thought he needed sleep,
but it only got worse.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.583
- Does it hurt to swallow?

09:00.627 --> 09:02.672
- You have to help him!
- I'll do everything I can.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.718
- Bloom, lymphs are swollen.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.676
- Okay, open for me?

09:08.678 --> 09:11.159
- What?
What do you see?

09:11.202 --> 09:12.900
- He needs an FNA, ASAP.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.337
Who's on call for oncology?
- Dr. Sharpe.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.649
- Daddy, who is that man?

09:22.692 --> 09:24.607
- Shh.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.350
- My name is Dr. Kapoor.

09:28.393 --> 09:29.699
I'm going to help your mom.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.135
- She can't see.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.094
Her eyes are broken.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.748
- Then I'll try to fix them.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.619
- Let's find
a healthy snack, kiddo.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.838
- Yeah.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.883
- We'll be just outside.

09:42.146 --> 09:45.628
- I see
from your records, Maren...

09:45.672 --> 09:46.890
you've had a rough time.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.631
- Yeah.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.286
My organs, they shut down
during Violet's birth.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.635
I couldn't stop bleeding.

09:52.679 --> 09:56.421
I was in the ICU
for, uh, nine months.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.641
Ian had to make arrangements.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.382
Just in case.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.471
- But you survived.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.647
Well, most of me.

10:04.691 --> 10:09.391
- So you developed an adenoma
at the base of your brain.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.784
It's pressing
on the optic chiasm

10:10.827 --> 10:12.655
and causing your blindness.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.310
- Yeah, and everyone says
they can't remove it

10:15.353 --> 10:18.269
because I can't have anesthesia
'cause of my liver.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.314
- That's right.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.359
But there is a new treatment--

10:21.403 --> 10:22.709
non-surgical.

10:22.752 --> 10:26.451
I won't even need
to break the skin.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.670
- How?

10:27.714 --> 10:30.325
- It's MRI-guided
focused ultrasound--

10:30.368 --> 10:34.677
noninvasive,
no anesthesia.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.939
Just one catch.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.506
- Yeah.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.856
There's always a catch.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.684
- Before I can address
your brain tumor,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.730
we need to replace one
of your heart valves

10:43.773 --> 10:46.341
also weakened
by Violet's birth.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.343
But I'm sure my colleague,
Dr. Reynolds,

10:48.386 --> 10:50.954
can do that
without anesthesia as well.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.958
- Wow.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.615
I would love to see
my daughter's face.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.620
I would love to see her eyes.
I would.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.584
- Hi.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.499
I got your page.

11:14.543 --> 11:15.936
- Yeah.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.380
Mr. Velez?

11:25.423 --> 11:26.947
This is Dr. Sharpe.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.688
She's gonna biopsy
your brother's throat

11:28.731 --> 11:31.691
so we can figure out
what's making him so sick.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.868
- Open up for me, Mr. Velez.

11:34.911 --> 11:38.262
- Arroyo.
His name is Miguel Arroyo.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.742
- I thought you guys
were brothers.

11:39.786 --> 11:40.787
- We're like brothers.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.353
You know, we are Boricua.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.964
We grew up a town apart
on La Isla,

11:44.007 --> 11:47.445
but we never knew each other
until we came to New York.

11:47.489 --> 11:48.882
- When did you move here?

11:48.925 --> 11:50.884
- Hurricane Maria
took everything.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.756
My home was washed away,
and no one was coming to help.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.499
So I left to find work
so I could rebuild one day.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.284
Took any job I could get--
construction, picking apples.

12:00.328 --> 12:03.244
And that's where I met Miguel--
on a farm upstate.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.768
- El destino.
- SÃ­.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.597
We both lost everything
but fate.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.339
She brought us together
to protect each other.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.949
You see?
So we are more than friends.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.473
Hermano.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.307
- Ah...specimen cup.

12:23.351 --> 12:26.006
- Here.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.454
- Admin sent me
about a nameplate?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.630
- Oh, yes.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.545
Great.
Thank you.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.025
I've been calling
for a month.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.809
- Just tell me what you need,
Dr. Merritt.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.637
- No, actually, I'm, uh,
Dr. Reynolds.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.639
- Oh.
Nameplate says "Merritt."

12:50.682 --> 12:53.816
- Right, and I want it
replaced with "Reynolds."

12:53.860 --> 12:55.644
- "Dr. Reynolds"?
- Correct.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.950
- Okay, gonna have to get

12:56.993 --> 12:58.647
the Chair
or Cardiothoracic Surgery

12:58.690 --> 13:00.083
to sign off
on a request like that.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.693
- Not a problem.

13:01.737 --> 13:02.825
I'm the Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

13:02.869 --> 13:03.826
- Dr. Merritt.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.610
- No, Dr. Reynolds.

13:05.654 --> 13:06.960
- Well, it says
Dr. Merritt's the Chair.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.310
- Well, he's not.
I'm the Chair.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.746
- Well, then why are you
in his office?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.314
- This is my--

13:13.357 --> 13:15.838
Um...you see
how confusing this is?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.666
Well, I have
this same conversation

13:17.709 --> 13:19.015
with every patient
that comes in here,

13:19.059 --> 13:20.669
which doesn't help them
to be confident

13:20.712 --> 13:22.366
in the doctor they chose
to cut them open

13:22.410 --> 13:25.065
because he can't even get
his name on the door.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.937
- Yeah, I'm thinking you might
need a new nameplate.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.854
- Yeah.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.729
- Henry.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.993
- Chemo stomach.
It's no joke.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.864
You're telling me.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.127
Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.737
You know what this room
used to be?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.696
- Mm, I think legal had it?

13:47.739 --> 13:49.829
- Well, the fun part
is who had it before legal.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.395
- Hmm.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.876
- In '67, we'd call this
the "Nookie Closet."

13:53.920 --> 13:55.008
- Did you?

13:55.051 --> 13:56.879
Now it's a stone's throw
from HR,

13:56.923 --> 13:58.881
so why don't we let that one
sail right by?

13:58.925 --> 14:00.665
You mind if we get
right to it?

14:00.709 --> 14:02.102
- Not at all.

14:02.145 --> 14:05.845
- I'd like to schedule you
for a medical evaluation.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.847
- Nothing wrong with my health,
Dr. Goodwin.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.066
- Just consider it a formality.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.633
Okay?

14:11.676 --> 14:13.896
- This hospital requires
a medical eval

14:13.940 --> 14:15.942
every two years.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.727
I passed my last exam
less than a year ago--

14:18.770 --> 14:20.381
with flying colors,
I might add.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.948
- I don't like it
any more than you do,

14:21.991 --> 14:25.865
but it is my job.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.911
- I've been in practice
for more than 40 years...

14:28.955 --> 14:31.000
all of them here.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.133
I can do my surgeries
blindfolded.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.396
- I appreciate that, Henry.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.485
I do, but I would still like
to schedule you

14:37.528 --> 14:39.139
for a routine eval.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.926
Tomorrow.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.756
- Of course.

14:47.799 --> 14:50.106
You got to do your job.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.201
- So you need me to perform
a valve replacement

14:58.245 --> 15:00.203
so that you can do
an MRI-focused ultrasound.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.511
It shouldn't be a problem.
- Keep scrolling.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.862
- Oh, your patient
can't withstand anesthesia.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.646
- That's right, but if I can
perform a procedure

15:08.690 --> 15:10.779
the procedure on the brain
without anesthesia,

15:10.822 --> 15:12.781
you can certainly do
the same thing for the heart.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.522
- Yeah, the only
noninvasive surgery

15:14.565 --> 15:16.654
is catheter aortic
replacement therapy.

15:16.698 --> 15:17.786
- Yes, do that.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.092
- Which requires
a C-ART device,

15:19.135 --> 15:20.920
which New Amsterdam
does not have.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.225
- So we'll get one.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.488
-  Yeah, sure.
"So we'll get one."

15:24.532 --> 15:27.013
A C-ART device
costs $3 million.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.928
- I made Maren Thompson
a promise

15:28.971 --> 15:31.191
that I would help her
see her daughter.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.584
I'll get you this device.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.021
- Okay, Vijay, look,

15:35.064 --> 15:38.633
I can't even get my name
on my own door, all right?

15:38.676 --> 15:41.201
They're not gonna just buy you
a $3 million device.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.985
- We will see about that.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.515
- Uh, remember when you told
me we'll treat everyone here

15:51.559 --> 15:52.734
no matter the price?

15:52.777 --> 15:53.996
- That's the power
of New Amsterdam.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.563
- Yes, well, we need
a C-ART device.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.608
- Okay, I'll call ACC.
Done.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.175
- Do you know
what a C-ART device is?

15:59.219 --> 16:00.785
- Will it help your patient?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.048
- It's the only thing
that will help.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.136
- Good enough for me.
- Thank you.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.051
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
I thought you were gonna handle
that whole Dr. M situation?

16:06.748 --> 16:07.923
- Yeah, handled.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.272
Medical eval scheduled
for tomorrow.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.013
- Well, he moved
his temporal bone surgery

16:11.057 --> 16:12.232
up to today.

16:17.541 --> 16:20.066
- Help!
Help! He needs help!

16:20.109 --> 16:22.546
What's happening to him?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.984
- Push two milligrams
of Ativan.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.289
Biopsy results?

16:26.333 --> 16:28.944
- They just came back.
It's not cancer.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.511
Must be an infection.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.034
- Given the ulcers,
it's got to be viral.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.775
I'll start Acyclovir.

16:33.818 --> 16:36.256
- I saw polys on the biopsy.
Bacteria's much more likely.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.127
- Or the polys are due
to a secondary infection

16:38.171 --> 16:40.260
on top of the viral infection
and irrelevant.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.044
It's my ED, my call.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.872
- And if I disagree
with your call?

16:43.915 --> 16:46.570
- Bloom, we got four more!
Similar symptoms to Mr. Arroyo!

16:46.614 --> 16:48.311
Visible ulcers
in the back of the mouth.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.921
- Four more?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.749
- Where did they come from?
- Watch out.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.622
- We all work together.
They were all sick, too!

17:04.806 --> 17:08.070
- Mind if I scrub in?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.724
- What are you trying to prove?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.639
- Nothing, just here
to observe.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.598
- I've done this surgery
hundreds of times, Dr. Goodwin.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.731
I don't need the hospital's
Medical Director

17:16.774 --> 17:20.387
standing over my shoulder
evaluating my every incision.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.128
- Then pretend I'm not here.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.217
- You trying to throw me
off my game, is that it?

17:24.260 --> 17:25.740
- I expect all the surgeons
in my hospital

17:25.783 --> 17:27.611
to perform at their best

17:27.655 --> 17:29.744
whether I'm here watching
or not.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.703
- Anyone's not performing
at their best, it's you.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.359
Running a hospital
while undergoing chemo?

17:36.403 --> 17:38.231
You have no right to judge me.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.754
- This isn't about me.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.539
- I've helped thousands
of patients at this hospital.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.324
Thousands.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.239
My record is sterling.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.371
My reputation impeccable.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.894
- Henry, you're a legacy here.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.592
- Damn right I am.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.160
- But what story do you want
told in the end?

17:54.203 --> 17:56.771
That you were a titan
in your field,

17:56.814 --> 17:58.599
or that you were a doctor
who didn't know

17:58.642 --> 18:01.906
when to lay down the scalpel?

18:01.950 --> 18:04.692
- There'll come a day, Max...

18:04.735 --> 18:06.128
when you won't be able

18:06.172 --> 18:09.610
to perform as well
as you once could.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.786
Maybe sooner than you think.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.146
- Well, they all
work together

18:24.190 --> 18:26.148
out at some vineyard
out in Long Island.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.715
- And they're all exhibiting
the same symptoms?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.543
- To a T.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.762
- What at a vineyard could have
made them all so sick?

18:31.806 --> 18:33.634
- Let's find out.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.593
- The owners made us sleep
in this old, rundown barn.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.813
All crowded together,
cramped.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.467
- How many of you?

18:40.510 --> 18:42.904
- 17, sometimes 18.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.602
At night, I just tried to think
of my family back home.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.430
- Las ratas.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.910
- Yes, there were so many rats.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.652
- I've been picking
since Hurricane Georges.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.872
Been 20 years since I've seen
Puerto Rico.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.571
- Have you harvested
at this vineyard before?

18:57.614 --> 18:58.876
- No.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.227
And I will not go back.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.664
I will starve first.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.753
The owner treat us
like animals.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.668
Pay us nothing.

19:07.711 --> 19:11.324
And everything was damp
and wet all the time...

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
mold everywhere.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.514
- I'm thinking pesticides led
to an autoimmune reaction--

19:27.557 --> 19:28.906
erythema multiforme.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.647
EM would explain everything.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.302
- Their kidney function's fine.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.217
The rats and the close quarters

19:35.261 --> 19:38.438
are the perfect breeding ground
for the hantavirus.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.917
- Something's off.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.789
We're missing something.
- Really?

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
I think Sharpe
may have nailed it--hanta.

19:43.660 --> 19:47.795
- No, it's not hantavirus.
- Okay. Because?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.927
- Because...

19:49.971 --> 19:52.452
I have a gut feeling.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.367
- Or you're just
disagreeing with me

19:54.410 --> 19:56.369
because it's my diagnosis.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.587
- Everything okay here?

19:57.631 --> 19:59.328
- Yes.
- It's fine.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.330
- Okay, at the risk
of stepping into something,

20:01.374 --> 20:02.723
I'm gonna make the call.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.855
Treat for hantavirus.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.995
- Suction.
- Suction.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.490
- I dropped a bottle, Iggy.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.405
One stupid bottle.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.278
I was, um...

20:36.322 --> 20:38.933
I was worried.

20:38.976 --> 20:41.283
- You moved the surgery up

20:41.327 --> 20:42.545
because you knew
you wouldn't pass

20:42.589 --> 20:43.677
the medical evaluation.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.766
- I moved up my surgery

20:45.809 --> 20:48.029
to prove the evaluation
wasn't necessary.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.596
- No, Henry, come on--

20:49.639 --> 20:52.338
- I may not be
a young man anymore, Iggy...

20:52.381 --> 20:56.429
but I am a surgeon with over
40 years experience.

20:56.472 --> 20:59.562
And that counts for something.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.869
At least it should count
for something.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.529
- You really buried the lede

21:09.572 --> 21:10.747
on the whole C-ART device,
didn't you?

21:10.791 --> 21:11.748
Three...

21:11.792 --> 21:13.446
$3 million.

21:13.489 --> 21:16.013
- To be fair, you did say,
"No matter the price."

21:16.057 --> 21:17.624
- No, you're right.
I really should have asked

21:17.667 --> 21:18.886
more prudent
follow-up questions.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.801
Like, "Does it cost
$3 million?"

21:20.844 --> 21:22.411
To be clear,

21:22.455 --> 21:24.761
New Amsterdam will never get
a C-ART device.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.633
- See, what'd I tell you?

21:26.676 --> 21:28.504
The system can't handle
the small things.

21:28.548 --> 21:29.810
Why in the hell
should we be surprised

21:29.853 --> 21:31.464
when it can't handle
the big ones?

21:31.507 --> 21:32.987
- You didn't let me finish.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.380
New Amsterdam will never get
a C-ART device,

21:34.423 --> 21:35.685
so you should do the surgery

21:35.729 --> 21:38.645
at a hospital
that does have one.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.429
- What are you saying?

21:40.473 --> 21:43.693
- University has
a C-ART device.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.869
We have a patient.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.872
Peanut butter, jelly.

21:50.047 --> 21:51.527
- So, as our sister hospital,

21:51.571 --> 21:53.007
they'll let us do
the surgery there?

21:53.050 --> 21:56.140
- Not exactly...
and definitely not for free.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.665
- But her insurance
won't cover University.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.101
- Yeah, and then I can't do
the surgery.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.711
- No, you can't.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.453
But Dr. Merritt can.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.890
Last I checked, he's still
credentialed at Uni.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.505
- Okay, wait, wait.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.377
Impersonating another doctor
is grounds for malpractice.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.771
I can lose my license.
I can go to prison.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.033
- Nobody's suggesting

22:19.076 --> 22:20.556
impersonating anyone,
all right?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.471
You are the Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery

22:22.515 --> 22:23.646
at New Amsterdam.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.648
Just say that.
- This is crazy.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.694
Even for you.
- You want to help the patient?

22:27.737 --> 22:29.739
This is how.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.047
Are you really

22:33.090 --> 22:34.527
talking about this?

22:34.570 --> 22:36.398
Sneaking a patient
across the city

22:36.442 --> 22:38.661
into University Hospital?

22:38.705 --> 22:42.622
- If the system can't handle
the little things...

22:42.665 --> 22:44.972
then it certainly won't notice
the big ones.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.066
Sure.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.771
- University Hospital.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.055
- Can I help you?

23:25.099 --> 23:26.622
- Dr. Nottingham.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.755
I'm here to observe
a C-ART procedure

23:28.798 --> 23:29.973
as part of my residency.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.454
I called earlier.
- Observe who?

23:32.498 --> 23:33.934
- The Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery

23:33.977 --> 23:35.022
at New Amsterdam.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.589
It's nice to meet you.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.242
- Dr. Merritt?

23:38.286 --> 23:40.114
- That's what it says
on my door.

23:45.075 --> 23:48.427
- Pushing the delivery system
up to the aortic valve.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.037
- You're nearly there.
- How much longer?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.560
- Ah, ah, ah.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.344
Don't rush me,
and I won't rush you.

23:53.388 --> 23:54.781
- If we get caught,
it's my name on the schedule.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.957
- Well, Dr. Merritt
will cover for you.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.307
- I didn't see anything.

23:59.350 --> 24:02.571
- Thank you, Maren.

24:02.615 --> 24:03.833
- Sheath's in place.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.444
- Got it.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.793
Inflating the balloon.

24:06.836 --> 24:09.404
- Leaflets are moving.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.973
- Maren, you'll feel
some pressure.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.541
Nice and easy.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.805
Almost got it.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.503
- All right,
new aortic valve's in place.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.505
Deflating the balloon.
- Wonderful.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.767
Let's get her back
to our hospital now.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.421
- Dr. Reynolds.
- I see it.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.683
- What?

24:27.727 --> 24:29.424
- A bleed
at the cath insertion site.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.773
It's a common side effect,

24:30.817 --> 24:32.862
but Maren's gonna have
to remain flat

24:32.906 --> 24:34.821
with a sandbag on her hip
to keep the pressure on.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.605
- For how long?

24:36.649 --> 24:37.867
- It looks like
you're gonna have

24:37.911 --> 24:39.869
to do your procedure here
as well.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.481
- But I'm not Dr. Merritt...

24:42.524 --> 24:43.786
either.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.710
- Got them all on a cocktail
of antivirals,

24:54.754 --> 24:56.625
and we're doing
active fluid replacement.

24:56.669 --> 24:57.800
- Thanks.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.976
- You don't think it's hanta?

25:00.020 --> 25:02.501
- No.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.638
What do I know?

25:11.597 --> 25:13.076
- You know,
Henry was shattered--

25:13.120 --> 25:15.644
just standing there
watching the surgery

25:15.688 --> 25:16.863
go on without him.

25:16.906 --> 25:17.994
It's like looking
at a broken man.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.996
- You did the right thing.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.607
-  Did I?
- Yeah.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.391
- Then why do I find myself
trying to recall

25:23.434 --> 25:24.958
Judas' good traits?

25:25.001 --> 25:26.568
- Iggy, I know
he's a good friend,

25:26.612 --> 25:28.352
but so are you, okay?

25:28.396 --> 25:30.006
You didn't betray him
because somebody could have

25:30.050 --> 25:31.704
gotten hurt or worse.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.532
- Well, his body is going.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.011
His mind is not.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.578
Very few doctors have
that kind of expertise.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.580
I mean, if--if we send him
on his way,

25:38.624 --> 25:40.539
all that knowledge,
all that expertise

25:40.582 --> 25:42.497
goes out the door with him.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.803
You know, we might as well be
saying, "Hey, Doc, thank you.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.544
You're ancient.
Don't need you anymore."

25:45.587 --> 25:46.719
Don't let the door hit you
on the wrinkly old ass

25:46.762 --> 25:47.807
on the way out."

25:47.850 --> 25:50.592
- Hi.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.639
Oh.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.597
Hello.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.077
How are you?
all: Hello.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.818
- Good-bye, Iggy.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.689
- Huh?
- Leave.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.691
- Yes, I'm sorry.

26:02.735 --> 26:03.692
Bye.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.041
- Um, I'll be back in ten.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.695
I just need to fire
a few people.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.743
- You know you can't, uh,
fire me, right?

26:10.786 --> 26:12.483
- I was referring to Iggy.

26:12.527 --> 26:13.484
- Yeah, you can't
fire him either.

26:13.528 --> 26:14.616
- Yes, I know, Max.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.009
But it makes me look in charge,

26:16.052 --> 26:17.706
and right now I could use
a little bit of that.

26:17.750 --> 26:20.709
- How are things
with you and Bloom?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.755
- Fine.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.757
Um, h-how are you feeling?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.410
- Good, yeah.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.890
Aside from Iggy starting
an international rumor

26:27.934 --> 26:29.588
that we traffic in ageism,
pretty...

26:29.631 --> 26:31.502
Good.

26:31.546 --> 26:32.808
- Your nausea?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.157
- Chemo tried to slow
this man down,

26:34.201 --> 26:36.551
but you know what?
- It failed?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.118
- No, it succeeded,
big-time.

26:38.161 --> 26:42.165
But, uh, the drugs you gave me
are helping.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.863
- Good.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.604
Well, it sounds like you're
in the right frame of mind

26:45.647 --> 26:47.214
to start radiation.

26:47.257 --> 26:50.086
Aren't you glad you swung by?

26:53.873 --> 26:55.831
So glad.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.529
Okay.

26:58.573 --> 27:01.097
Everyone just act normal,
like you belong here.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.882
- Like we're doctors
in a hospital?

27:02.925 --> 27:04.623
- MRI lab is down this way.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.625
- How are we gonna get in?

27:06.668 --> 27:09.192
- You might have
to schedule us again.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.542
- I'm starting to miss
the real Dr. Merritt.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.197
- How are you doing, Maren?
- Nervous.

27:14.241 --> 27:18.506
I haven't let myself be hopeful
in a very, very long time.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.944
- I know this whole process
has been rather unorthodox,

27:21.988 --> 27:24.817
but I made you a promise,
and promise I will keep.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.689
- Dr. Kapoor,
what are you doing here?

27:29.952 --> 27:31.780
Funny story, actually.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.130
Dr. Carlebach was one
of my best interns

27:34.174 --> 27:35.654
back in the day.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.568
And now he's this
big-time neurologist

27:37.612 --> 27:39.527
here in University.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.703
- Yeah, Dr. Kapoor tried
to recruit me to New Amsterdam.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.531
I wanted to go--
I really did, Vijay--

27:43.574 --> 27:45.707
but my med school loans
were out of control.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.578
I had to go private.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.276
- It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.799
I got to admit,

27:50.843 --> 27:52.671
I still miss my days
at The Dam.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.151
Making the most out of nothing,
thinking outside the box.

27:55.195 --> 27:58.807
Always such an adventure.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.684
- Funny you should say that,
Dr. Carlebach.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.738
Initiating sonication pulse.

28:16.782 --> 28:20.176
And going again.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.787
Mrs. Thompson, we're using

28:21.830 --> 28:23.527
high-intensity
focused ultrasound

28:23.571 --> 28:24.964
to pinpoint the tumor
at the base of your brain.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.706
Oh, okay.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.708
- Maren, how are you feeling?

28:31.057 --> 28:33.755
Honestly, I don't know.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.278
I thought I was doing this

28:35.322 --> 28:38.238
so that I could see
my daughter's face, but...

28:38.281 --> 28:41.720
I don't think I am.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.678
I think...

28:43.722 --> 28:46.028
I wanted her to see mine.

28:46.072 --> 28:49.249
I want--I want her
to see me seeing her,

28:49.292 --> 28:52.295
being...

28:52.339 --> 28:55.037
Proud and growing up
and falling down,

28:55.081 --> 28:57.997
being scared.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.651
I want her to know...

29:00.695 --> 29:03.002
all her life...

29:03.045 --> 29:05.352
that she's seen.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.971
- The tumor is responding.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.297
- Hey.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.126
Is, uh, this seat taken?

29:42.868 --> 29:46.088
You know, we're, uh, doing
everything we can for Miguel...

29:46.132 --> 29:47.263
and the others.

29:47.307 --> 29:48.961
- Thank you.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.270
- What's that?

29:54.314 --> 29:57.143
- A santo.

29:57.186 --> 30:01.277
After Maria, our house
was just mud and water

30:01.321 --> 30:04.367
and the trunk of a huge tree
where my bedroom once stood.

30:04.411 --> 30:07.196
I went to a santeroin town
and asked him to carve this

30:07.240 --> 30:08.807
from the wood of that tree.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.287
- As a reminder?
- No, no.

30:11.331 --> 30:13.637
There are many a santo
on the island.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.944
This one is Anima Sola--

30:15.988 --> 30:17.946
the Lonely Soul.

30:17.990 --> 30:21.776
She is in Purgatory,
bound to the flames forever.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.258
And I pray to her
for strength and patience...

30:25.301 --> 30:27.434
and redemption.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.436
- Why redemption?

30:29.479 --> 30:32.439
- I, um...

30:32.482 --> 30:34.397
I liked to drink...

30:34.441 --> 30:35.877
too much.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.966
And I could not stop.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.273
And I would be dead
if not for her.

30:40.316 --> 30:43.145
She helps me to say no.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.104
She reminds me to always think
of tomorrow.

30:45.147 --> 30:46.888
She keeps me alive.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.759
- And yet you work
on a vineyard...

30:50.109 --> 30:52.111
- Surrounded by temptation
every day.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.939
- Miguel helps me with that.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.984
Never lets the others tempt me
with the angel's share.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.420
- "Angel's share"?

30:57.464 --> 30:59.945
- In the barrels,
the top layer of wine?

30:59.988 --> 31:01.294
It evaporates.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.166
They call that
the angel's share.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.864
- I like that.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.778
- So do all my friends,
believe me,

31:07.822 --> 31:09.868
and all the other workers.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.217
At the end of a shift,

31:11.260 --> 31:13.784
they would dip into the crush
and drink.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.699
After the way they treated us,

31:15.743 --> 31:17.745
they felt like they deserved
a little taste.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.271
- Well, I'm sure the angels
would agree.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.367
- Blood pressure 60 over palp.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.369
- Then he's fading fast.
- Add Dobutamine.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
Ten micrograms per minute.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.459
- It's odd that his heart rate
is 78.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.027
It should be 178.
The antivirals aren't working.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.333
- Mariana!

31:40.376 --> 31:41.856
Mariana, hang a bag
of streptomycin!

31:41.900 --> 31:43.205
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

31:43.249 --> 31:44.337
The hantavirus
is affecting his heart!

31:44.380 --> 31:45.860
He needs a pacing wire.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.035
- No, He needs
streptomycin, okay?

31:47.079 --> 31:48.732
I-I don't have time
to explain.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.996
Do you trust me or not?

31:53.259 --> 31:55.739
- I am setting up
a pacing wire.

32:04.009 --> 32:07.229
Lauren, you open this door!

32:07.273 --> 32:08.448
Lauren!

32:08.491 --> 32:11.930
What are you doing?
Don't do this!

32:11.973 --> 32:14.236
- Call Dr. Goodwin.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.995
- Ready?

32:34.039 --> 32:35.388
- Come here.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.694
Here we go.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.874
- Mommy, will you be able
to see me?

32:43.918 --> 32:46.094
- Oh, I hope so, honey.
- Almost there.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.197
- What do you see,
Mrs. Thompson?

33:04.373 --> 33:06.854
- Mommy?

33:15.515 --> 33:18.039
It's okay, baby.

33:19.910 --> 33:22.913
Because in my head
and my heart, I see you...

33:22.957 --> 33:24.872
so clearly, okay?

33:24.915 --> 33:28.223
I see you perfectly.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.833
- I don't understand.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.227
I thought you said
it was gonna work?

33:34.925 --> 33:37.711
- The tumors were destroyed.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.366
Surgery should have worked.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.197
- There must be something
we missed.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.212
- Miguel Arroyo is stable.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.083
Let's, um--let's treat
the others

34:02.127 --> 34:04.738
for oropharyngeal tularemia.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.045
They got it from drinking
partially fermented wine

34:07.088 --> 34:09.090
right out of the barrels.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.921
That's why Ivan never showed
signs of illness.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.097
He's sober.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.407
You know, you and I
working together like this...

34:22.973 --> 34:24.975
It's not gonna work.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.977
- You're right.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.942
- Oh, hey, how was your
radiation treatment?

34:34.985 --> 34:36.900
- Mm, like
a relaxing vacation...

34:36.944 --> 34:37.901
at Chernobyl.

34:37.945 --> 34:40.034
- Right.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.862
Henry, hi.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.342
- Um...

34:43.385 --> 34:45.387
if this is about
the exit paperwork,

34:45.431 --> 34:46.910
I was about to get to it.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.043
- Yeah, good.
Great, okay.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.915
Don't get to it.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.308
- Excuse me?

34:53.352 --> 34:55.484
- Because you're not exiting.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.141
Can I tell him because of your
whole throat thing?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.229
- Could I stop you
if I wanted to?

35:01.273 --> 35:02.274
- No.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.928
Okay, I am, uh...

35:04.972 --> 35:07.496
very happy to tell you
that we here at New Amsterdam

35:07.540 --> 35:09.977
would officially like
to offer you

35:10.020 --> 35:13.285
the brand-new position
of Chair of Telemedicine.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.591
- "Telemedicine"?
- Video conferencing.

35:15.635 --> 35:17.985
We can reach
our sister hospitals

35:18.028 --> 35:19.552
in Latin American,
disaster sites,

35:19.595 --> 35:21.336
war zones,
all around the world.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.295
- Yeah, all in need
of experienced doctors like you

35:23.338 --> 35:26.254
to help guide and consult them
through complicated surgeries.

35:26.298 --> 35:29.997
- Surgeries that you've done
hundreds of times.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.130
- I, uh...

35:34.567 --> 35:36.177
Thank you.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.441
- It's your experience
that's irreplaceable...

35:39.485 --> 35:42.052
not your hands.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.322
- I just don't see anything.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.846
- May I touch your face
to perform an examination?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.326
- Yeah, that's fine.

35:54.369 --> 35:57.067
- Please close your eyes.
- Mm.

36:00.984 --> 36:03.335
- I would like
to try latanoprost.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.554
- That's...

36:08.470 --> 36:10.080
- Uh, what's wrong?

36:10.124 --> 36:12.605
- Your eyes are harder
than they should be.

36:12.648 --> 36:15.521
This indicates glaucoma
might have developed.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.436
But there is no way
you would have

36:17.479 --> 36:18.654
ever known about it.

36:18.698 --> 36:21.396
- There's always
a catch, right?

36:25.095 --> 36:28.186
- Please lean your head back
for me.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.188
- Yeah.

36:33.278 --> 36:36.150
- Blink.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.681
Oh, that's
a beautiful drawing, baby.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.950
Yeah.

37:36.993 --> 37:40.127
Oh.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.563
- Can you see us?

37:41.607 --> 37:44.349
- Yes, my love, I can see you.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.742
Can you see me?
- I can see you.

37:46.786 --> 37:49.354
- You can?

37:53.183 --> 37:55.621
I can see.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.148
- It turns out
being Dr. Merritt

38:01.191 --> 38:03.324
does have its advantages.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.635
Come here.
Oh...

38:12.507 --> 38:14.727
I see you.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.470
- Retractor.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.525
- Hey.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.311
Oh, looks like someone's
feeling better.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.489
No, don't thank me.

38:37.532 --> 38:40.361
Thank your brother
and his santo.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.493
She told me the answer.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.757
- El Anima Sola?
- Yes.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.455
- You two are really lucky
to have each other.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.370
I, uh...

38:49.414 --> 38:52.112
don't really get along
with my real sister.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.244
But what you two have...

38:54.288 --> 38:56.377
you're gonna rebuild.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.642
I know it.

39:00.686 --> 39:01.817
- Here.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.471
Please, for you.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.081
- No, I-I can't--
- Yes, yes, yes.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.474
I insist.

39:06.518 --> 39:08.215
My brother, he will
take care of me,

39:08.258 --> 39:11.479
and Anima Sola,
she will take care of you.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.313
- Thank you.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.854
- Max?

39:40.465 --> 39:43.119
- What's wrong?

39:47.602 --> 39:50.257
- I've, um...

39:50.300 --> 39:52.085
I've been round and round
in my head,

39:52.128 --> 39:55.088
but I can't see
that there's any other way.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.351
- Helen?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.747
- This is harder
than I thought.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.449
I think that I need to report
an impaired physician.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.103
- No, we already
took care of it.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.278
There's no--
- Max...

40:11.321 --> 40:13.280
I'm talking about Bloom.

40:21.636 --> 40:22.768
- Babe, is that you?

40:22.811 --> 40:24.726
- Yep.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.300
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:33.343 --> 40:35.781
- How is the guy
who's not about

40:35.824 --> 40:37.304
to let cancer slow him down?

40:39.915 --> 40:42.788
Profoundly humbled.

40:46.748 --> 40:49.229
- I made dinner.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.579
Steak, baked potato,
and broccoli.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.581
- Wow.

41:08.683 --> 41:10.511
- Chemo?

41:10.555 --> 41:12.382
- Radiation.

41:12.426 --> 41:15.821
My throat, it's already--
- Oh, babe.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.519
- Helen said that
I wouldn't even feel it

41:18.563 --> 41:19.651
for four to five days.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.653
- Well, you really are special.

41:21.696 --> 41:25.395
- So special.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.310
- It smells...

41:27.354 --> 41:31.184
it smells amazing.

41:31.227 --> 41:34.492
Sorry.
- Hey...

41:34.535 --> 41:36.929
you have nothing
to be sorry about.

41:36.972 --> 41:39.366
- Maybe you should put me
in the return pile.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.803
Nope.

41:41.847 --> 41:44.676
You are a keeper.

41:56.601 --> 41:59.212
- Stay there.
