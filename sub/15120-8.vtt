04:08.920 --> 04:11.526
When I found out I was going to be a mother,

04:14.120 --> 04:15.849
I started thinking.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.966
About all the things that I hadn't
thought about in a long time,

04:23.760 --> 04:25.922
Things that I didn't wanna
remember ever again.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.611
And now you're telling me to remember

04:28.680 --> 04:30.523
when all I want to do is forget.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.807
Those things that happened to you

04:40.680 --> 04:42.330
hurt very deeply.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.647
And to remember them is like living
through them all over again.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.450
It's terrifying.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.080
But it's your past, Sam.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.804
If you can remember it,
you can put it behind you'

How much?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.045

07:34.120 --> 07:37.363
We don't want to alarm her friends

07:38.360 --> 07:40.283
- We should keep her away from there.
- No.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.648
I want whoever she works for to see
there's nothing to worry about.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.563
I'll make sure she's not left

- Why haven't they done that already'?

16:33.280 --> 16:35.760
This. This is for show.
They figured out we're watching'

16:35.960 --> 16:37.291
So she's not in immediate danger.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.450
They could kill her any moment
and you know it

16:39.560 --> 16:41.164
We need to pull her out.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.162
- How do you suggest we do that?
- We go in.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.601
Well, that would blow the op.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.604
It's not an option, is it, Deacon?

16:48.760 --> 16:51.604
Turners still alive.
He still has the evidence against our client

16:52.400 --> 16:54.641
And that's worth the life
of your best operative, is it?

16:54.720 --> 16:57.690
We get Turners evidence out,
then we get Sam out, not before'

How are we supposed to get
that case out of there?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.563

17:01.920 --> 17:03.285

17:05.520 --> 17:06.646
We don't get the case out.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.205

17:59.680 --> 18:00.806

18:01.640 --> 18:03.244
That's your plan? Letting Tumer win'?

18:03.680 --> 18:04.806
How does that help?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.966
You go with Soomro
as a member of his security detail.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.883
Once the evidence is verified, you destroy it.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.842

the house if it doesn't exist.

and he doesn't win the contract.
