WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:14.472
I wanted us to meet because I have been
thinking things and then not...

00:14.556 --> 00:19.060
I read scripts, or I read articles,
or my friends are talking about something

00:19.144 --> 00:21.187
and I think, "I totally disagree."

00:21.271 --> 00:23.148
Then suddenly, I read your stuff,

00:23.231 --> 00:26.484
and you're articulating
exactly what I've been thinking.

00:26.568 --> 00:30.530
So I know that somehow we're supposed
to work on something.

00:30.613 --> 00:34.159
It's weird because I write,
obviously, a lot about sexuality

00:34.242 --> 00:37.996
and the backlash I get often is
from people you wouldn't expect.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.166
So in the article
that you're saying you read,

00:41.249 --> 00:43.418
I wrote about having a gangbang fantasy.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.420
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And...

00:45.503 --> 00:49.382
Then women are angry that you acknowledge
that you have a rape fantasy,

00:49.466 --> 00:51.342
because they want to pretend you don't.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.430
The other thing is, like,
stop judging other people's fantasies.

00:55.513 --> 00:58.349
Like, that's thought police shit, right?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.518
I definitely feel like
I'm increasingly libertarian.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.063
-You don't have to agree with me.
-I do.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.523
I would love to write something for you,

01:05.607 --> 01:07.525
because as we were talking about,

01:07.609 --> 01:11.780
it's easier to put these words
in the mouth of a character

01:11.863 --> 01:13.406
than to say them myself.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.742
-It's safer. Especially now.
-Yeah.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.619
I don't want to be run out of town
on a rail.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.330
-A script is like the safe space.
-Yeah.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.248
-Or not safe space.
-"Safe space." Jeez.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.501
-All of that safe space--
-It's so bad.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.504
There are no safe spaces. There are no--

01:27.587 --> 01:30.256
The more people talk about
needing a safe space,

01:30.340 --> 01:34.385
the more I feel like they're creating
a world where no one is safe.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.138
-I'm gonna be rude and check my phone.
-It's all right.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.932
Because I have to be somewhere.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.643
-How rude.
-Yeah, I'm really late.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.436
-I'm gonna run. Sorry.
-Go.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.564
I loved our judgment-free zone,
and I would like to hang out again.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.899
-We're gonna.
-Okay.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.443
-I'm sorry.
-It's good.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.861
-Bye.
-See you later.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.767
I notice a lot of girls on Tinder,

02:22.851 --> 02:25.854
their profiles will be very specific
about what they want.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.107
I think that shows
how desperate a lot of guys are.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.317
-Our profiles are blank.
-[audience laughing]

02:31.401 --> 02:34.946
My profile would be like,
"If you're racist, we'll work on it."

02:35.780 --> 02:38.992
Like, "I'm a feminist,
but women do be shopping, though."

02:39.075 --> 02:41.035
And then fireworks
in the background and shit.

02:41.119 --> 02:45.331
They say opinions are like assholes,
and I agree

02:45.415 --> 02:48.084
in that I wish my girlfriend
cared more about mine.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.004
I don't want to go to your house,

02:51.087 --> 02:53.715
'cause it smells like Diet Coke
and divorce.

02:54.549 --> 02:58.928
Grindr is actually
a dick pic trading platform

02:59.012 --> 03:02.432
where guys sometimes
accidentally meet up with each other.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.767
My full name is Odinaka Malachi Ezeokoli.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.605
My parents' names are Ben and Monica.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.690
[all laughing]

03:13.776 --> 03:18.323
I'm Nigerian, I think. I don't know.
I don't know, man.

03:18.406 --> 03:22.327
I grew up in America and Nigeria.
That makes me Dominican. Maybe.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.995
[all laughing]

03:24.078 --> 03:27.415
I had this other homeboy, Umbeka.
He was similar to me but different.

03:27.498 --> 03:32.045
He came to America from Nigeria at,
like, ten years old.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.588
He didn't know
what black stereotypes were.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.423
So kids be fucking with him,

03:35.506 --> 03:37.759
and he had no idea
what they were talking about.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.721
This kid walked up to him like,
"Bet you like that watermelon, don't ya?"

03:43.056 --> 03:44.182
"Yes.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.184
[all laughing]

03:51.439 --> 03:52.565
Pretty delicious."

03:57.028 --> 03:58.279
They stopped fucking with him after that.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.782
I think that's my time.
My name is Odinaka. Good night.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.701
[all cheer and applaud]

04:03.785 --> 04:05.912
[man] All right. Odinaka!

04:06.704 --> 04:10.416
The bookstore is closed.
We got to get out of here, guys.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.128
-[chattering]
-[laughing]

04:19.342 --> 04:21.302
Send me a message?
We'll make up.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.971
-What's up?
-You going to Cole's?

04:23.054 --> 04:25.181
I got to go Uber tonight, yeah.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.349
-All right.
-Unfortunately.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.268
-I'll see you later.
-Okay. See ya.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.909
A lot of the bar culture in the US
is not about dancing.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.327
-[Odinaka] Yeah.
-And...

04:46.411 --> 04:48.788
You find a bar, it's like,
"This place is perfect.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.083
I just wish there was an actual space
to dance and feel comfortable."

04:52.166 --> 04:57.297
Yeah. And you can really get a sense for
somebody's energy by dancing with them.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
I feel you with that, for sure.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.510
I should never have done journalism.
I know that.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.305
I should have been a doctor or lawyer.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.974
-And be like other Indian dudes? [laughs]
-Yeah.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.476
-That's what I should have done, 100%.
-Followed that path?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.812
I should have just sold out.

05:12.895 --> 05:16.566
[laughs] Yeah.
I guess like most immigrant parents.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.651
Doctor, lawyer, engineer.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.696
-Your parents are happy with comedy?
-Hell, no.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.824
You kidding me?
No, they hate that I do this shit.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.492
I might as well be smoking crack
to my parents.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.870
-[laughs]
-[Odinaka] Shit.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.007
[woman] The great thing about being
confirmed in the Catholic church,

05:41.090 --> 05:44.469
I can do whatever I want for years
and then just ask for forgiveness,

05:44.552 --> 05:48.389
and I go to heaven
while most of you burn in hell forever.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.641
That's a joke, you guys.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.436
Nigeria has some shit I've never seen.
It had a bounce with it.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.229
It had its own axis.

05:55.313 --> 06:00.151
Like, "I'm going to the market.
I'm going to the market."

06:00.234 --> 06:01.861
It's like they was carrying
their ancestors.

06:01.944 --> 06:06.115
"I'm going to the market. We are going
to the market. We! All of us!"

06:06.199 --> 06:08.159
[laughs]

06:08.493 --> 06:10.787
Aw, shit. I can barely pick it up.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.580
Y'all saw that bullshit attempt
I just made.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.583
I got a minute.
I'm already done, huh?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.418
-What is it, 30 seconds?
-[woman] You have 20 seconds.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.669
How do I land this?

06:19.837 --> 06:20.880
I...

06:21.714 --> 06:23.257
Shit, man.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.302
Yeah.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.891
I think that's it.
Is that it? I think that's it.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.852
-Okay, I'm done.
-[audience cheers]

06:34.936 --> 06:37.271
-[Sally] Are you funny?
-[laughs]

06:37.355 --> 06:40.525
Man, that question. I'm like... I mean...

06:40.608 --> 06:42.110
What's your stand up about?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.862
I guess I'm autobiographical.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.407
I tell stories about growing up
in America and Nigeria

06:48.491 --> 06:49.700
and not fitting in either.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.785
-[laughs] Nice.
-Yeah.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.079
[chuckles] Yeah, pretty much.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.455
What about you? What do you do?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.084
Well, I also write about myself.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.710
So, equally narcissistic.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.588
Yes. Okay. Birds of a feather.
Same boat.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.423
Yeah. I write a lot of essays.

07:04.507 --> 07:08.010
They tend to deal with sexuality and...

07:08.719 --> 07:10.304
contemporary feminism.

07:10.388 --> 07:15.560
Or criticizing contemporary feminism
more recently these days.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.438
Criticize contemporary feminism?
What do you mean?

07:18.521 --> 07:20.940
Um... I go on a lot of angry rants

07:21.023 --> 07:24.235
where I basically critique
female sexual victimization,

07:24.318 --> 07:27.989
which I think is increasingly
a central part of certain factions

07:28.072 --> 07:29.031
of the feminist movement.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.868
-Yeah.
-So I pretty much...

07:31.951 --> 07:35.997
I basically write, like,
a ton of pro-slut manifestos,

07:36.747 --> 07:41.794
sort of disguised as personal essays
that are meant to be entertaining.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.297
Okay. That sounds really dope, actually.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.258
[laughs] I'll send you a link.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.093
For sure. I'd love to see that.

07:49.677 --> 07:50.845
Thank you.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.188
[elevator bell dings]

08:07.862 --> 08:11.073
-Oh! Hi, there.
-[chuckles] How are you doing?

08:11.157 --> 08:12.617
-How are you?
-Good.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.369
-You look fabulous.
-Thank you. You, too.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.412
I like purple.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.581
-[door closes]
-So good to see you.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.174
I have some projects.
I'v e got some irons in the fire.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.511
Just waiting for one of them to get hot.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.262
TV stuff?

08:33.888 --> 08:36.265
Yeah. Yeah, TV.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.520
Mostly TV.
What's the story with your writing?

08:41.437 --> 08:42.647
-It's good.
-Yeah.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.940
Going.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.943
Is it true you're never safe
around a writer?

08:47.026 --> 08:50.321
[chuckles] That might be true, actually.

08:50.404 --> 08:54.534
I'm that person that writes things down
when people say funny stuff.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.576
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.162
You should get your notebook out
right now, 'cause...

08:58.246 --> 09:01.624
So, a friend told me that you're allowed

09:01.707 --> 09:05.503
to be given $14,000 a year,
tax free, as a gift.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.755
So, I've had,

09:07.838 --> 09:13.010
actually, I've had two clients
give me $14,000 checks.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.555
And I paid them 14 grand in cash.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.016
Yeah. So I've laundered, successfully,
$28,000.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.810
Wow.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.436
Oh!

09:23.980 --> 09:26.065
-You deserve that?
-I've been bad.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.109
-Really?
-Yeah. Ow...

09:29.610 --> 09:30.945
-Oh.
-Oh.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.488
Mmm.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.078
[both groaning]

09:45.376 --> 09:49.130
Mm-hmm. Slowly. Slowly.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.553
You can go slower.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.349
-So bad.
-[laughs]

10:01.267 --> 10:02.101
[Sally moans]

10:03.477 --> 10:04.312
Yeah.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.397
-Yeah?
-Uh-huh.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.526
[moaning]

10:41.098 --> 10:42.892
[alarm beeping]

10:55.279 --> 11:00.284
Good morning. Happy Wednesday.
Today there will be bridge lifts, okay?

11:00.368 --> 11:03.579
Sales people, make sure
you guys are communicating as usual.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.916
Charlie, 2008 will start
at Michigan Avenue Bridge.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.044
I think there were a couple of switches
on the sheets.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.463
Charlie, 805 should be on there.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.549
Have a great day out there.
Do what you do best.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.927
-All right, guys. Let's go.
-All right.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.325
-[woman] Hi!
-[Odinaka] Hey. How you doing?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.660
-Good morning.
-[woman] He has the tickets.

11:42.743 --> 11:43.661
[man] Thanks, man.

11:43.744 --> 11:47.748
[Odinaka] We are coming up on where
Chicago started, at this intersection.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.168
Michigan and Whacker
is where Fort Dearborn was.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.295
It's the military base
that preceded Chicago.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.257
Jean-Baptist-Point Du Sable
was here before that.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.758
Is it really a mile long?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.302
[Odinaka] The Magnificent Mile? No, no.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.804
It's called the Magnificent Mile,

12:01.887 --> 12:03.639
but it's actually
about three-quarters of a mile.

12:04.056 --> 12:08.102
A marketing guy came up with the term.
Real catchy.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.395
[man] Kosciuszko.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.022
[Odinaka] There's a bridge in New York
named after the same guy.

12:12.106 --> 12:12.982
Apparently, he was a big deal.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.859
This guy with the gyroscope?

12:14.942 --> 12:19.363
Copernicus. He was the first guy
to tell us that the world is round.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.031
Press the button.
You know how to do that?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.825
I can press a button.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.743
But thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.621
All right. One, two, three... wow!

12:27.705 --> 12:31.459
One crazy one. One, two, three...
[screams]

12:31.542 --> 12:32.668
Love it. All right.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.258
-Thank you. Appreciate it.
-Great tour.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.759
Thanks. Appreciate it.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.512
Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.683
This is it.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.435
-It's nice.
-Thank you.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.020
Nice rug.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.230
[Sally] Do you want a drink?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.691
-Yeah. I'd love one, actually.
-Okay.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.652
You look like someone
that would have created an app.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.071
[laughs] Is it cause I'm Indian?

13:01.155 --> 13:03.657
-I didn't mean it like that.
-I'm kidding.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.743
You just were born
and are apparently rich.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.912
That's fair enough.

13:07.995 --> 13:12.458
I was hoping that we could not have
too much touching.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.168
Okay. Yeah.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.337
-I have a girlfriend.
-Okay.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.382
And I can't cheat on her. So...

13:21.634 --> 13:23.886
I was kind of hoping, you know...

13:24.470 --> 13:26.430
It's gonna sound so...
Okay, I watch porn,

13:26.931 --> 13:28.474
and that's not cheating.

13:29.141 --> 13:34.522
And so I was hoping this could be
like porn but, like, in real life.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.691
-Like, IRL porn. You know?
-[both chuckle]

13:37.775 --> 13:40.110
-I can make that happen for you.
-Okay.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.238
[moaning]

13:46.492 --> 13:48.077
Okay, no. No, no, no.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.703
Can't be kissing you.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.122
[laughs] You're leaving me
hanging a little bit.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.084
I like to be spanked.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.046
-Oh, my God.
-Please.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.215
-No. No.
-Please.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.926
[laughs]

14:04.009 --> 14:05.844
I don't know what I'm doing.
Where am I?

14:05.928 --> 14:08.055
-Hey, no. Calm down.
-I'm just...

14:08.138 --> 14:11.267
Doing this in a respectful way
with a neutral person,

14:11.350 --> 14:16.355
who doesn't have your phone number,
is not going to blow up your phone,

14:16.438 --> 14:18.274
who's not gonna
expect anything from you.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.192
-No emotional attachment.
-Yeah.

14:20.276 --> 14:23.404
Is a positive thing because...

14:24.280 --> 14:27.408
otherwise, you're just gonna get
to a breaking point,

14:27.491 --> 14:29.451
and you're gonna end your relationship.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.871
-Physically, I want to continue.
-Yeah.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.374
Emotionally,
it's probably not a good idea.

14:36.917 --> 14:37.960
[moans] Oh, my God.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.378
-I'm gonna come.
-Oh, my God.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.090
I want you to. I'm gonna come with you.
[moans]

14:43.841 --> 14:44.884
-[Odinaka] Hey.
-[woman] Are you Odika?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.552
-Odinaka.
-Odinaka?

14:46.635 --> 14:47.720
Yeah, that's me.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.763
You do decently, driving an Uber?

14:49.847 --> 14:53.392
Uh, it's all right.
You know, I pay my bills.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.060
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I do this,

14:55.144 --> 14:57.646
and I got this other job
where I give tours of the city.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.608
I'm a City of Chicago tour guide.

15:00.691 --> 15:05.237
Between those two things, uh,
it balances out.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.045
There's not been a thousand deaths
in a year since then.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.589
Are they tearing down
all the projects like they are in Atlanta?

15:23.672 --> 15:25.299
-They're gone.
-They're gone, right?

15:25.382 --> 15:29.011
They're done. It's been a decade.
There's, like, three left.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.221
Where are all the poor people?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.431
[laughs] "Where the poor people?"

15:32.514 --> 15:35.517
What were you gonna say?
Because you said, "Where are all the..."

15:35.601 --> 15:36.894
and then you said, "poor people."
You adjusted.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.064
-That's not true. That's not true.
-[laughs] You adjusted.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.942
-Come on, Atlanta, you ain't fooling me.
-You're right.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.945
I'm really uncomfortable in this ride
and the fact that you have a car.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.780
I was surprised.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.949
-[laughs]
-No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.492
I don't know what I thought
I'd prove to myself,

15:51.575 --> 15:53.285
that I could do a play in Chicago.

15:54.370 --> 15:59.458
But it's ended up being just kind of,
like, a very deep exercise in loneliness.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.585
I don't mean to laugh.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.922
No, it's okay.
I'm sort of outside of rehearsals.

16:05.005 --> 16:09.343
I'm just kind of in this condo watching TV
and jerking off and...

16:10.594 --> 16:11.845
Yeah.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.930
Is that okay?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.392
[moans]

16:19.937 --> 16:21.814
[Sally] You have a nice body.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.238
Such a contraption.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.782
I know. Too much clothes.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.660
[moans] Whoa!

16:35.577 --> 16:36.745
You're so strong.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.498
I feel lucky to be alive now,

16:39.581 --> 16:44.628
because being my size
even five, seven years ago was not cool.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.547
It was, like, pro-ano times.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.173
-What'd you say?
-Pro-ano.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.758
Like pro-anorexia?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.469
And I'm like,
"Word. This is working for me."

16:52.553 --> 16:54.054
Yeah, it's working for me.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.682
It's working for you? Okay. I'm glad.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.851
It's for you.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.563
[chuckles]

17:02.646 --> 17:04.148
Good spanking.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.818
"Hey, Doritos! This is some bullshit, man.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.486
I get my six-year-old these chips,

17:09.570 --> 17:11.405
now y'all stuffing the gay agenda
down his throat

17:11.488 --> 17:12.656
and he'll grow up to suck dick."

17:12.740 --> 17:16.243
-I was like, "Wait a minute, sir.
-[audience laughs]

17:16.326 --> 17:17.911
That's not how snacks work at all."

17:19.163 --> 17:21.373
I was watching sci-fi with my ex.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.292
And he's cleaning up around the house.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.626
He picks up some of my hairs.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.378
I've never seen this man
throw the hairs away.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.631
And I'm like, sci-fi.
This is the part where I get cloned.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.966
I'm about to get cloned, right?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.509
First black woman ever cloned.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.678
What a dubious honor,
considering the circumstances,

17:34.762 --> 17:36.472
but I'll take it.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.725
Then I'm like, "Rebecca, joke's on him.
This is a weave."

17:39.808 --> 17:42.853
It's gonna be a motherfucking horse.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.646
Victory. I consider that a victory.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.398
I'm so happy to bring this guy up.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.108
He's one of the funniest in this city.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.361
So just turn up right now
for Odinaka Ezeokoli.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.072
[all cheer and applaud]

17:56.116 --> 17:57.993
Yo. What's up? How we doing?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.787
-Doing good?
-[all] Yeah.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.623
Are you hungry?
Maybe we get a drink and then go out.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.291
-Yeah, that sounds great.
-Yeah?

18:04.374 --> 18:05.334
Yeah, I'm down.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.086
Steak, you eat steak?

18:07.169 --> 18:09.922
-I eat whatever you want to eat, man.
-Okay.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.590
-Guys, how you doing?
-What's up, Cole?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.717
Whatever the gentleman would like.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.719
-I'll have a Negra Modelo.
-[Cole] Sure. Got it.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.678
[Jay] Negroni?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.514
-I'll make it.
-Thanks.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.390
-Hey!
-Hi. How are you?

18:21.225 --> 18:24.394
-Thanks for coming.
-Wow! This is kind of amazing.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.854
-You liked my doorman?
-Yeah.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.066
-I loved your doorman.
-Good view.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.317
[gasps]

18:32.194 --> 18:33.112
What?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.241
-It's good, right?
-How did you do...

18:37.324 --> 18:39.493
[Annabelle chuckles] How do you do this?

18:39.576 --> 18:41.036
You want some tea?
I just made some.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.872
So you've written screenplays
and sold them

18:43.956 --> 18:46.625
and you're collecting residuals
and you just didn't want to tell me?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.002
Oh, yeah. I wish. Um...

18:49.837 --> 18:51.338
No. So...

18:52.089 --> 18:53.632
Yeah, the money situation, I mean...

18:55.342 --> 18:56.385
I...

18:58.512 --> 19:01.265
I don't usually tell people this,
but I feel like you're non-judgmental

19:01.348 --> 19:04.309
or that you are judgmental,
but in the right way.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.938
But I'm basically a hooker.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.692
Yeah.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.819
-Wait. Are...
-Reveal!

19:13.902 --> 19:15.154
-You're a...
-[laughs]

19:15.237 --> 19:16.822
-That's such a...
-[exclaims]

19:17.489 --> 19:18.699
[Sally laughs]

19:18.782 --> 19:20.826
-Digest.
-Yeah.

19:20.909 --> 19:25.205
[stammers] Do you have an agency?
Are you working through an agency or...

19:25.289 --> 19:26.874
-No. I'm independent.
-Okay.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.917
I make all the money myself.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.254
I worked at an agency
for a couple of months,

19:32.337 --> 19:33.797
and I was like, "This is crazy."

19:33.881 --> 19:36.508
-'Cause they take half of the money.
-Yes.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.677
Yes. So, why am I paying some creepy guy?

19:38.760 --> 19:40.387
And how are you safe?

19:40.971 --> 19:42.514
You know what I mean?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.850
-How do you vet people?
-Vet people?

19:44.933 --> 19:48.228
So, there's an unexpected system
of support

19:48.312 --> 19:50.022
within the industry of girls.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.190
I don't see any people

19:51.273 --> 19:53.775
who don't have references of other people
who they've seen.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.319
-Does that make sense?
-Yeah.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.696
If a guy wants to see me, he e-mails me.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.449
And I'm like, "Do you have any references
of other girls you've seen?"

20:00.532 --> 20:02.534
He would send me their sites

20:02.618 --> 20:03.952
so I can see they're real people.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.663
And then I e-mail them directly
and say, "Have you seen Ted?"

20:06.747 --> 20:09.291
Then they're like,
"Yeah, he's 35 and safe."

20:09.374 --> 20:11.960
-And he's not an ax murderer.
-Right. Literally, yeah.

20:12.669 --> 20:16.298
Or they'll be like, "Yes, but beware,
he's really overweight."

20:16.381 --> 20:19.509
-"Here's the thing about Ted."
-Yes, exactly.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.679
-And it's really cool.
-Ted.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.600
[chuckles] Yes. Ted. Everyone knows a Ted.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.645
You're blowing people,
but you're also being like,

20:29.728 --> 20:32.814
"Tell me about your problems.
What's the thing with your divorce?

20:32.898 --> 20:36.735
That's so-and-so crazy about your job.
What about the stock market?"

20:36.818 --> 20:38.779
I know so much about the stock market.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.197
Do you mean it?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.783
I imagine that you would be
genuinely comforting.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.619
-Are you? Or do they say, "You're cold."
-Yeah.

20:45.702 --> 20:46.954
[both laugh]

20:47.037 --> 20:47.871
No.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.206
I don't know you well enough to know.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.332
I'm not cold.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.833
That's the amazing thing about

20:51.917 --> 20:54.503
the way that sex workers are portrayed
in the media.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.089
They're always cold, robotic monsters.

20:57.172 --> 21:00.968
Like, in order to fuck people for money,
you must be an emotionless robot person.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.137
But the reality is
that the most successful sex workers

21:04.221 --> 21:07.182
are the opposite because
you have to make someone feel good.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.686
Now, have you told men that you're dating?

21:11.853 --> 21:13.272
It doesn't go over well.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.317
Tell me a little bit
about this TV project.

21:18.151 --> 21:21.113
Yeah. Well, you saw my story.

21:21.196 --> 21:25.242
I grew up here in the States,
and I went to high school in Nigeria.

21:25.325 --> 21:28.287
'Cause my parents wanted us to know
where we're from.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.414
Meet our grandparents,
basic shit like that.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.790
Learn the language.

21:31.873 --> 21:35.377
And it's like putting that journey on TV.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.839
Being a kid in America,
going to boarding school in Nigeria,

21:38.922 --> 21:43.051
and I guess I would think about it
as like  Freaks and Geeks  in Nigeria.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.721
In a Nigerian boarding school
with all Nigerian kids.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.141
You're in the school,
you're in that world,

21:49.224 --> 21:51.143
and that world is foreign to the audience,

21:51.226 --> 21:54.354
but it's also foreign to the main guy,
who's there.

21:54.438 --> 22:00.235
You have a voice.
You have a unique, fresh, original voice.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.113
And I can't create that.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.949
I can only add structure, you know?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.744
I can help with people.
I can bring in people.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.121
I can bring in a director.

22:11.204 --> 22:15.584
I can bring in writers,
but I'm sorry, I'm already...

22:15.667 --> 22:17.544
This is what I do.
I'm already jumping into things.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.797
Yeah. You seem real comfortable
doing that jumping.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.549
-Yeah. You're really into it.
-[laughs]

22:22.632 --> 22:27.012
I always say that comedians are like
the canary in the coal mine.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.347
-Like artists, except they're louder.
-Uh-huh.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.184
And they're the ones
that we have to listen to.

22:32.267 --> 22:35.771
'Cause it's a funny way of being serious.
Isn't that what...

22:35.854 --> 22:37.189
Yeah. I guess it's what I'd say.

22:37.272 --> 22:41.151
Anyhow, I'm getting too philosophical,
but you get my meaning.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.904
-No, I appreciate the nice things, man.
-Yeah.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.782
Before we go any further,
should I be dealing with your agent?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.034
If I'm interested in...

22:49.576 --> 22:50.869
I don't have an agent.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.290
No, it's always just me. Yeah.

22:55.373 --> 22:59.586
All right, well, so,
we can be in touch more directly, then.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.130
Yeah, I'm open.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.965
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.886
Thank you. Thanks.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.976
-She likes you.
-Please.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.604
-Did you get her number?
-I did not.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.148
It's good to see you.
What brought you here?

23:21.191 --> 23:23.652
Just got a few projects.
A few meetings.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.364
Yeah. I met with this Nigerian comic

23:27.447 --> 23:30.325
that I've been corresponding with,
and he's good.

23:30.408 --> 23:34.913
He's gonna be at an open mic next door
that I'm gonna go to.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.498
-This open mic?
-Right.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.125
I know this open mic.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.335
I've been thinking about doing it.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.045
-That's so weird. Yeah.
-Really?

23:42.129 --> 23:45.715
Maybe I'll meet you guys, right?
I mean, I could...

23:45.799 --> 23:48.635
If you want to do it, you should do it.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.304
-Maybe I'll do it.
-Do it.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.265
-I should do it.
-That'll be fun.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.852
Yeah, I have had a lot of things
that I want to say.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.937
And maybe that would be a good place to.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.440
-Annabelle Jones, stand-up comedian?
-[laughs] No.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.068
-We're going to meet the grandparents.
-[Odinaka] The grandparents.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.946
-He's going to meet his grandparents.
-Yeah. It's a he?

24:08.029 --> 24:13.326
I'm going to meet them too because
it's the first time they are grandparents,

24:13.410 --> 24:15.620
so I have no idea how they're gonna be.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.373
-They're gonna change up.
-Oh, my God.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.418
-I'm sure they're super excited.
-Mm-hmm.

24:22.544 --> 24:26.089
So, your husband's not...
Is he already there?

24:26.173 --> 24:27.841
-You gonna meet him there--
-No.

24:27.924 --> 24:32.554
No, no, no.
He's working a lot here.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.055
Okay.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.809
-He's, like, so busy, all the time.
-Yeah.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.856
He wanted to go,
but it's almost impossible for him.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.192
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:46.109 --> 24:47.861
-[mic whines]
-Hey, one, two.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.363
One, two.
Can y'all hear me in the back?

24:50.447 --> 24:52.073
One, two. One, two.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.575
-Is that... Hey!
-[Annabelle] Hey!

24:53.658 --> 24:54.701
Yo, Jay.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.328
-Hey.
-Yo.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.205
-How you doing?
-Doing good.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.623
-What's happening?
-How you been?

24:59.706 --> 25:01.917
-I've been great.
-Glad to see you. This is Annabelle.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.918
-Hi.
-Hey.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.544
Annabelle Jones, nice to meet you.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.879
What's up, Annabelle?

25:05.962 --> 25:07.130
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.757
I've heard a lot about your stuff.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.760
-It's really funny. It's nice to meet you.
-Cool. Thanks.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.554
So I think I want to go up tonight.
Is that okay?

25:14.638 --> 25:16.473
-You want to sign up?
-I think so.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.683
-It's okay?
-Definitely. That's why we're here.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.518
-There's room?
-Definitely.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.812
I've never done it before.

25:22.896 --> 25:23.897
Nah, you good.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.524
-I don't want to harsh anybody's mellow.
-[laughs]

25:26.608 --> 25:28.068
That's not gonna happen.

25:28.151 --> 25:28.985
It's gonna be great.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.321
-Hey, hi.
-Hey.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.989
-It's so good to see you.
-Same.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.241
Thank you for coming.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.076
I'm very excited to hear your rant.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.202
So glad you're here.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.079
-Are you prepared?
-No.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.790
-Perfect.
-No, I'm not. Not at all.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.125
-You're going to be funny.
-Okay.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.921
Jay. Jay, Jay.
This is my new friend Sally.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.757
-Nice to meet you.
-Sally.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.968
And this is OD. OD, Sally.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.178
-Hey. Sally, what's up?
-Uber!

25:55.262 --> 25:57.931
This is my new friend Sally.
What are you talking about?

25:58.014 --> 25:59.766
He drove me in an Uber,
like, three days ago.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.142
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Amazing!

26:01.226 --> 26:04.980
We, like, slit our wrists
and the blood. All that stuff.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.439
It's a small world.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.942
And you're not dating, are you?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.694
-No. No.
-Okay.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.198
-No, no, no.
-No, we're old friends. No.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.492
-[Odinaka] All right.
-Okay.

26:17.575 --> 26:20.537
Hate speech is free speech, you fuckers.

26:20.620 --> 26:24.249
Like, I have to be free to hate people.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.959
I'm not gonna like everybody.

26:26.042 --> 26:29.629
Stop telling my--
I'm, like, don't tell me--

26:29.713 --> 26:31.131
I'm gonna calm down for a second.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.550
What is this,
"Where's the moment of consent?"

26:33.633 --> 26:36.720
Have you guys heard that?
Have you men dealt with this?

26:36.803 --> 26:39.306
Has any woman ever accused you of rape?

26:39.389 --> 26:40.557
It happens all the time now.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.891
I won't think you're a rapist.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.185
My dad never said,
"I want to dance at your wedding."

26:44.269 --> 26:47.063
It was like,
"What are you going to do with your life?"

26:47.147 --> 26:50.108
It was, like, I got to have a career.

26:50.191 --> 26:53.987
And what I was told is that
I could have a career and kids.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.615
It'll all just happen, you know.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.241
And it doesn't. Not for everybody.

26:58.325 --> 27:02.996
But, man-spreading.
Mansplaining, we covered.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.457
-[Jay]  Get off. Now get off.
-[Annabelle]  What?
