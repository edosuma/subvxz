-Where were you last night

00:04.754 --> 00:06.381
-till this morning.
-I was with my girlfriend.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.718
-Who is she? Where do we find her?
-Carly Landis, where was Steve last night?

00:09.968 --> 00:12.595
-With me, why?
-That’s when Tina Most was murdered.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.556
Do you have any physical evidence
tying me to her death?

00:14.723 --> 00:18.018
You’re running a con, and you react bad
when the girls get hinky about it.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.936
Why are you lying for the guy who did it?

00:20.061 --> 00:22.897
He said that if I said anything,
he would kill me.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.899
Is there any way you
could give me a ride home?

00:25.775 --> 00:27.318
I left my things in the back.

That’s one you drop off
and speed away from.

This is another case of your past
getting dropped on me.

Look, I banged plenty of whores,

00:34.242 --> 00:37.787

I wouldn’t do that. No one does.

-I’m just giving her a ride home.
-Good.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.125
I’m sorry. I’m scared to be alone
right now.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.960
Maybe I’ll stick around
for a little while.

Are you just gonna leave
without saying anything?

01:32.008 --> 01:34.385
-Didn’t want to wake you.
-I hate when guys just leave like that.

I’ll see you.

you’re gonna call me, okay?

But that was then,
and this is now, I know.

No, you don’t know. I’d love to sleep in,
I’d love to hang around with you all day,

but because this is now,
I have to get home and shower.

-You could shower here.
-Shave and change my clothes

her rent for another month,

LORI: Detective Clark, in the course
of your investigation,

11:43.577 --> 11:45.913
did you have occasion
to interview a Carly Landis?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.332
-Yes.
-What prompted that interview?

11:48.457 --> 11:51.252
The defendant had indicated
that Ms. Landis was with him

11:51.335 --> 11:52.503
when Tina Most was killed.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.047
-Did Ms. Landis corroborate that alibi?
-Initially.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.883
We later determined
that the alibi was false.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.218
How did you make that determination?

11:59.552 --> 12:03.264
As a result of our investigation,
we learned the defendant’s credit card

12:03.347 --> 12:05.015
was used late night
at a market downtown.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.892
LORI: Did you confront Ms. Landis
with this fact?

12:06.976 --> 12:10.020
We did, and she recanted
her initial statement.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.148
Was any reason given as to why she lied?

12:12.523 --> 12:15.276
She said the defendant had
intimidated her into doing so.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.862
Was she specific as to the
nature of that intimidation?

12:18.154 --> 12:20.156
She said the defendant
had threatened her life.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.450
I have nothing further.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.830
Detective, have you had occasion
to spend time with Ms. Landis

12:27.955 --> 12:30.040
outside the context of your investigation?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.501
Might have had a cup of coffee together.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.087
-Ever have dinner?
-Objection, it’s irrelevant.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.965
Your Honor, Ms. Landis has invoked
her Fifth Amendment rights

12:38.048 --> 12:39.341
and will not be testifying.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.636
Since Detective Clark
is the source of her statements,

12:42.803 --> 12:44.972
statements which incriminate
Mr. McClintock,

12:45.389 --> 12:47.516
I’m entitled to probe his credibility.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.810
I’ll allow it. Witness will answer.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.731
-I think we might have had dinner once.
-Ever been to her apartment?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.610
When I drove her home from the squad
I took her to her apartment.

12:57.693 --> 13:02.239
Did you leave her at the front door,
or did you take her upstairs?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.241
As I remember she was feeling
a little apprehensive.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.910
I might have walked her upstairs.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.495
-How long did you stay?
-No idea.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.705
Did you have sexual intercourse
while you were there?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.166
-Objection.
-Overruled. I’ll allow it.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.794
Counselor, you’re implying
something that’s not true.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.797
Ask that the court instruct the witness
to answer the question,

13:17.880 --> 13:20.841
-not characterize it.
-JUDGE: Yes or no, detective?

13:21.884 --> 13:22.968
It was one time.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.888
Yes, or no?

13:26.680 --> 13:27.932
-Yes.
-DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Thank you.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.893
Did you meet with Ms. Munson
in preparation for your testimony?

13:31.393 --> 13:32.436
Yes.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.897
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Did you tell her
about your relations with the woman

13:34.980 --> 13:37.399
whose out-of-court statements
you’re testifying to?

13:37.608 --> 13:38.692
I didn’t think it was relevant.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.070
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
If Mr. McClintock is incarcerated,

13:41.153 --> 13:44.031
the chief impediment
to your trysts with Ms. Landis

13:44.114 --> 13:46.742
-would be removed, would it not?
-Objection, that is speculative.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.203
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Just trying
to demonstrate relevance, Your Honor.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.704
But I’ll withdraw the question.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.333
Nothing further.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.722
What’s the thinking behind the mic?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.224
So we can hear.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.476
-If they give instruction?
-Hear them out.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.478
But don’t necessarily
do what they tell me?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.522
The chances are,
they’ll take the money and split.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.023
They’re not looking to stick around there.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.276
And we’ll be in constant communication.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.361
Nothing happens to my son.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.780
Surveillance van’s in Islip.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.782
-We can’t get it back in time.
-What does that mean?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.409
Means we’ll have to improvise a little.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.453
-We'll use department cars, that's all.
-’Cause I didn’t come in right away.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.789
It’s not the first time
we’ve done this kind of thing, sir.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.624
But you usually have a van?

14:35.749 --> 14:37.793
We’ll be fine.
Why don’t you take Mr. Garvin

14:37.877 --> 14:39.545
-out to the car?
-I’d like to go along on this.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.505
-Sorry, that’s not possible.
-Steve, I'll be all right.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.674
Uh, Mr. Kaufman, you can wait
upstairs in the squad room.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.846
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:50.180 --> 14:52.308
Whoever shows up,
we’re gonna take him down, all right?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.143
On kidnappings,
I go by federal guidelines.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.146
-Which are what?
-Try to maintain a visual contact

14:57.271 --> 15:00.316
until there’s a tactical advantage,
at which point we make an arrest.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.775
So, you run the risk of losing him?

15:01.942 --> 15:04.570
At which point, you got no money,
no victim, and no perp.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.781
Kidnapping’s a federal offense.
I go by federal guidelines.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.089
Yeah, still negative, nothing suspicious.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.760
-This your regular car?
-Yeah.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.348
You know you’re over 500 miles
past due for an oil change?

15:32.806 --> 15:33.849
I didn’t know that.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.977
-Make sure it gets into the shop.
-Yes sir, lieutenant.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.771
Today.

15:40.522 --> 15:41.941
BALDWIN: <i>He’s dropping the money now.</i>

15:50.658 --> 15:53.202
Hey, be advised we got a guy
on a motorcycle end of the block.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.538
We got him.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.168
-Why is he stopping there?
-Keep walking, Mr. Garvin.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.796
-Where is he?
-Let him go and return to the car, sir.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.965
Where is he? Come on, tell me where he is!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.216
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING)

16:07.466 --> 16:09.218
-Stay right here.
-He’s getting away.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.178
THOMAS: Yeah, that’s ’cause he’s made
that there’s cops.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.597
-I don’t want to compromise the situation.
-ANDY: So we just sit here?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.808
-That’s right.
-Bye-bye!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.310
THOMAS:
We’ll regroup at the station house.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.114
Where were you last night, Mr. Henning?

16:31.865 --> 16:34.368
I attended a performance
of <i>Awake and Sing!</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:36.578
-at my daughter’s school.
-What time would that have been?

16:36.787 --> 16:40.040
(SIGHS) See, the play started at 7:30.
It was over about 9:30.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.042
Can... can I ask what this is all about?

16:42.126 --> 16:44.128
We’re trying to understand
the reason for the phone calls.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.715
-What phone calls?
-See, now that’s a silly question,

16:47.798 --> 16:48.799
with all due respect.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.219
The phone calls to Tracy Gilchrist.
The phone-sex phone calls.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.473
-What about ’em?
-Judging by the volume of calls,

16:56.765 --> 16:57.850
you got in a little deep.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.644
-Is she claiming harassment?
-She’s dead.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.649
What was going on between you two, Barry?

17:07.067 --> 17:09.194
What was going on was
I found someone I cared about.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.821
Starting with the phone sex?

17:11.572 --> 17:13.741
There’s no way I’m going
to erase the stigma of that,

17:13.907 --> 17:16.785
so I won’t even try.
Yes, it started with the phone sex.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.455
Clearly, she made an impression.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.167
I’d been through the usual ritualized
blather with other girls.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.004
You know, "I’m in my bra and thong.
I’m touching myself."

17:27.796 --> 17:28.922
I hated all that.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.926
Tracy... Tiffany,
as she was calling herself

17:33.427 --> 17:34.678
used to say the same things,

17:34.762 --> 17:37.181
but I always sensed
it was her pretending to say them.

17:37.306 --> 17:41.518
That she was imagining herself
in a bra and thong.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.688
I don’t expect you to understand that.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.815
When’d you find out she had a boyfriend?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.193
The first time she agreed to meet me.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.653
And still, she’s letting you
rack up big charges

17:51.779 --> 17:53.572
for the phone calls, restaurants.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.618
You must have gone for some pricey gifts,
given the depth of your feeling.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.828
I see where you’re going with this,
but it’s not true.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.499
Yeah, I spent money on her.
I bought her painting materials.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.918
I paid her tuition
at the Art Students League.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.587
But I got exactly what I wanted
out of the relationship.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.049
-Where’d you go after the play?
-Went to dinner at Shun Lee,

18:12.466 --> 18:13.675
then I went back to my apartment.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.303
I got up at 7:30 this morning
to go to work.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.765
I’ll be happy to provide names
and contact information to verify that.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.016
That’d be good.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.894
She drew me a little picture, Tracy.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.855
It was a sketch she did
while we were on a bench in central park.

18:27.856 --> 18:32.277
I was afraid my wife would find it,
so I... threw it away.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.282
Why’d I do that?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.181
-How’d it go?
-Good.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.560
-What happened with the drop?
-Botched.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.062
We get a dump
on the father’s phone yet?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.648
Ransom calls come back
to a pay phone in Brooklyn.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.818
-You gonna get that car in for servicing?
-I’ll make the call right now.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.444
Where are we on the DOA?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.572
We talked to her phone-sex
customer, Barry Henning.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.074
-We’re looking into his alibi.
-What about those names

19:19.158 --> 19:21.243
-scratched on the wall?
-Nothing yet.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.204
-How’d your testimony go?
-Good.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.957
I just got a message
from Marty Pappus at Major Case.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.500
He’ll provide tactical support.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.460
Pappus, who used to be in Missing Persons?

19:30.669 --> 19:31.670
Right.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.382
-What’s he gonna do for us?
-Help us.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.096
Andy.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.142
He’s gonna do what he’s gonna do, Laura.
Get used to it.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.519
A little early to be calling
in the cavalry.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.730
There’s a protocol. You follow protocol.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.149
Okay I gotta say something,
because if I don’t say it,

19:52.232 --> 19:53.650
I’m not doing my job.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.653
Whatever protocols
you might be trying to follow,

19:56.945 --> 20:00.574
letting that guy get away set us back
and did nothing for the kid being held.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.284
Let’s say we do it your way.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.453
We try to take the guy down.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.207
We wind up in a gun battle,
lose the guy, and have the victim killed.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.833
That would be a worst-case scenario.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.502
I have to worry
about worst-case scenarios.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.880
To the point of being rendered
completely ineffective?

20:15.088 --> 20:17.132
This was a command decision,
and it’s been made.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.718
Sitting on our hands while the perp
beats feet with the money.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.511
That’s some command decision.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.348
That remark constitutes
insubordination, detective.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.601
Now, if rips don’t work,
I’ll take it to the next level,

20:27.809 --> 20:30.103
but I will not tolerate insubordination.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.564
You want me outta here, make the call.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.485
You got a case to work.

20:39.321 --> 20:44.618
-Uh... I... I can come back.
-What is it?

20:44.952 --> 20:47.704
Um, just to keep you current,

20:47.871 --> 20:50.624
we’ve run the names
that were scratched into the wall

20:50.874 --> 20:54.044
of the DOA's apartment with BCI, the DMV,

20:54.336 --> 20:56.296
through the nickname file,
the SAFIS system.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.883
-And?
-This is with whatever permutations

20:59.967 --> 21:03.428
of those names we could think
of Sam Parks, Samuel Parks,

21:03.595 --> 21:04.846
Parker Samuels, Park Samuels...

21:05.097 --> 21:09.059
-I get it, Medavoy. What do we have?
-So far, nothing.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.437
-Stay with it.
-No, we’re a long way from being done.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.107
-Good.
-Yeah.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.578
Phone dump on our kidnap victim
just came back.

21:28.912 --> 21:32.124
-There’s calls into your DOA.
-Our DOA? Tracy Gilchrist?

21:32.374 --> 21:34.835
-Going back and forth for months.
-That can’t be a coincidence.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.712
This kid, Todd Garvin,

21:36.795 --> 21:38.714
just flagged down a radio car
on Delancey Street.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.549
-Todd Garvin?
-Right.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.677
-That name hasn’t come up for us.
-Doesn’t matter, they gotta be related.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.015
I’m Detective Ortiz, Mr. Garvin.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.100
Did your son ever mention
the name "Tracy Gilchrist"?

21:50.309 --> 21:51.351
No, why?

21:51.601 --> 21:54.187
-Her name came up.
-There hasn’t been a lot of communication

21:54.271 --> 21:55.731
between myself and my son recently.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.399
Got some good news for you, sir.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.943
Your son’s in a police car.
He’s on his way over.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.862
Do we know what kind of shape he’s in?

22:02.154 --> 22:04.573
He’s got a few bruises.
Other than that, he’s fine.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.992
Someone want to fill in
the high command in all this?

22:07.492 --> 22:08.577
LAURA: I got it.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.705
-Counselor?
-We need to talk.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.665
You might want to hear this, too.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.305
You left court early,
so I figured you’d want to know.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.349
Judge excluded Carly Landis’ statement.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.309
I thought you said
the motion was a long shot.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.186
It was, till it came out in open court

22:34.394 --> 22:36.313
that your partner slept
with the defendant’s girlfriend,

22:36.688 --> 22:38.940
or was that something the two
of you didn’t think I needed to know?

22:39.149 --> 22:41.443
-How’s this?
-I didn’t think it was relevant.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.655
-You compromised a murder case.
-No, I did not compromise a murder case.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.032
The defense lawyer got lucky.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.576
I don’t like it,
but you can’t take it personally.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.244
I am taking it professionally.

22:51.661 --> 22:54.122
Consorting with a witness
was inappropriate enough.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.625
Keeping it from me so I couldn’t take
the stink off you.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.919
-That is unforgivable.
-It happen the way she said?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.004
She’d already recanted the alibi.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.382
The judge said your partner
wasn’t credible.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.218
-Our best evidence is gone.
-Take it up on appeal.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.761
LORI: Oh, thanks for the tip.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.679
Hey, I’m sorry, all right?

23:09.888 --> 23:11.765
You know, I didn’t know
how my predecessor did things,

23:12.099 --> 23:13.183
but here’s my deal.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.812
You need something, search warrant,
wiretap, whatever. I’m on it.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.482
I expect the same cooperation from you,
and I expect you to give a damn.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.983
-I got it.
-Good.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.987
Now I have to answer to my boss,
which I will do by putting it on myself.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.241
This time. Next time, it’s your ass.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.706
Wow. Talk about tightly wrapped.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.292
Did we not have a conversation
about you steering clear of that girl?

23:40.377 --> 23:42.295
She was bad off that night.
I erred in judgment.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.131
No, she wasn’t bad off. She set you up.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.883
-She saw you coming, and she played you.
-I don’t think you’re right about that.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.760
But it doesn’t matter
because the case will make,

23:48.844 --> 23:49.845
with or without my testimony.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.638
You feel qualified to make that statement?

23:52.097 --> 23:54.224
-Yes, I do.
-Okay, John.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.184
It’s not a big deal, Andy.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.124
ANDY: You gotta check
the statement when it comes,

24:19.583 --> 24:21.877
see if there’s anything
besides child pornography

24:21.960 --> 24:23.211
that they might have charged.

24:24.212 --> 24:26.423
They said they could issue new cards
by the end of the week.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.301
For now, we’ll just have
to make do without ’em.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.678
All right, Connie.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.264
yeah, I’ll see you
when I get home. Bye.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.393
Pot was almost done.
I figured I’d snag the last two cups.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.312
-I’m good.
-Save it for later.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.191
-Coffee?
-Oh, thank you.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.484
Detective?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.488
-TODD: Hey, Dad.
-Todd.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.532
Mr. Garvin, we’re gonna
need to talk to him for a minute.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.326
I understand. You all right?

24:54.618 --> 24:58.997
-Yeah, you know under the circumstances.
-All your fingers, all your toes, right?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.374
We’ll finish up with him,
then you can have him.

25:01.958 --> 25:05.170
-Todd?
-All right.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.220
-You had lunch, Mr. Garvin?
-No.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.765
-There’s a coffee shop around the corner.
-If it's all right, I’ll just wait here.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.438
Where are we?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.690
The phone-sex buddy looks
like he’ll probably alibi out.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.901
We got phone logs
with whoever else she talked to.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.319
We’re running the names through BCI.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.530
Let’s see if we can establish
a link with the kidnappings.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.615
In the meantime, any way you want
to proceed is fine with me.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.991
Just let me know what you need.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.293
-Any way we want to proceed?
-Let him know what we need?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.712
Andy must have softened him up.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.635
If you need to get looked at,
we can run you over to emergency room.

25:54.844 --> 25:55.929
TODD: I’m okay.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.975
Just as soon talk to you guys,
tell you whatever I can about this mess.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.393
Please.

26:01.935 --> 26:05.188
My girlfriend and I were
at Gorky’s on Avenue B.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.566
We started talking to this other couple.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.694
He does sculpture,
she wants to open up a club.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.781
We had a few drinks.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.326
He asked me if I wanted
to go see some of his work,

26:18.577 --> 26:20.287
-I say, "Yeah."
-They say their names?

26:20.579 --> 26:23.540
His name was Derek.
He said his name was Derek.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.083
Her name was Yvonne.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.335
I didn’t really get a last name
on either one of them.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.379
-So the four of you left together?
-The three of us.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.840
Tracy was tired. she went home.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.259
-They have a car?
-Yeah, like a van.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.468
JOHN: Make? Model?

26:35.760 --> 26:38.013
I’m not really much of a car person.
I didn’t take notice.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.391
-Where’d the three of you go?
-Some place in Brooklyn.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.519
We went over the Manhattan Bridge,
came down Flatbush.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.354
at some point, I think we were on Myrtle.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.190
I don’t know.
I don’t really know Brooklyn that well.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.650
What was the place they took you to?

26:50.775 --> 26:53.695
Some place that he worked,
like a converted garage.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.865
There were all these welding tanks,
metal rods.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.159
I will tell you, we smoked some hash.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.911
she had these temple balls and a chillum.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.581
-What can I say?
-Is that the only drug you did?

27:04.664 --> 27:06.916
Yeah, but I was pretty zoned out,

27:07.334 --> 27:10.795
and then all of a sudden,
I get hit by, like a pipe or something.

27:10.962 --> 27:14.132
The next thing I know, I’m on the floor,
my hands are tied, my ankles are tied,

27:14.341 --> 27:15.675
the two of them are standing over me.

27:15.842 --> 27:19.137
So... what? You gave them
your father’s number?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.598
He fired up a welding torch,
said he’d burn a hole

27:21.681 --> 27:22.891
through my hand if I didn’t.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.311
Any idea how they knew
that your father had money?

27:26.770 --> 27:27.771
I told ’em.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.691
Part of being an asshole
is that you want to impress people.

27:32.275 --> 27:35.195
I kind of let it slip that my family
has a house in the Hamptons,

27:35.487 --> 27:38.406
a town house on East 83rd Street.
I didn’t leave much to chance.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.241
They’d pick up on my father having money.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.452
So Todd, what’s the relationship
with you and your father?

27:43.203 --> 27:46.414
-Good.
-We know you had conflicts about money.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.042
-He said that?
-Words to that effect.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.212
Yeah. I don’t blame the guy.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.424
He’s been working his whole life.
He sees me go through all this money.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.135
Do you know he doesn’t even fly
first class?

27:59.636 --> 28:00.845
Todd, just so you know,

28:01.805 --> 28:04.683
if you did arrange this,
that’s a family matter.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.559
you can tell us,
it’s between you and your dad.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.104
I did not arrange this, no way.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.399
Last time you spoke
to your girlfriend was when?

28:12.732 --> 28:13.733
Gorky’s.

28:14.442 --> 28:15.902
Sorry to have to tell you this but,

28:16.277 --> 28:19.072
unfortunately she’s been
the victim of a homicide.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.325
(SCOFFS) That’s impossible.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.494
She was found
in her apartment this morning.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.876
I was just with her.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.962
We’re gonna need you to look
through some mug shots.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.505
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-ANDY: Yeah?

28:37.048 --> 28:38.174
Can I see you guys a minute?

28:45.682 --> 28:49.436
Why don’t you take some time?
Do you want something, coffee or soda?

28:50.061 --> 28:52.313
No, thank you.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.946
BCI says a Parks Benton
took a forgery collar

29:00.029 --> 29:03.074
a few years back
with a Samantha Lewitis.

29:03.533 --> 29:07.120
Calls herself Sam. Get it? Sam Parks.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.997
Like the name in your DOA's closet.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.083
There’s no address on Benton,
but Lewitis lives at 5th and C.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.462
(CLEARS THROAT) Josh, get this kid set up
with some mug books.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.796
Sure.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.395
This is bad between Andy and John.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.981
Andy’s not the easiest guy
in the world to get along with.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.817
John’s been pushing a little bit.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.279
From what I hear, he isn’t doing
anything Andy hasn’t done,

29:41.654 --> 29:44.240
-and then some.
-GREG: Andy came through all that, though.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.326
You can’t expect him
not to have a reaction.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.495
We gonna keep going with this?

29:49.954 --> 29:52.874
-No.
-Let’s not talk about it anymore.

29:53.666 --> 29:54.667

-What?

This!

30:35.291 --> 30:36.501
I won it playing poker.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.796
Well, think of a better story
before we get to the station house.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.351
In my office a second, Sipowicz.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.233
(SIRENS WAILING)

31:06.322 --> 31:08.533
When they were servicing the car,
they found a listening device.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.118
It’d been installed behind the dash.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.120
From what they tell me,
it probably hadn’t been

31:12.203 --> 31:14.539
-in there that long.
-Who installed it?

31:14.789 --> 31:16.457
I checked with internal affairs.
It wasn’t them.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.627
Given my relationship with them,
I trust, I got a straight answer.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.213
I also checked with the DA’s office
and the U.S. Attorney.

31:22.839 --> 31:23.840
It wasn’t them either.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.135
Whoever talked my son into that car
knew things to say to him.

31:27.635 --> 31:28.678
This is how they knew.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.723
I spoke to lieutenant Greco over at Taru.
They’re gonna go through the car,

31:31.806 --> 31:32.891
see what they can come up with.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.684
I’d like to hold onto this if I could.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.269
I don’t want you running
with this yourself.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.313
Let me call the manufacturer,
see where they sell them.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.107
Detective, I’ve gotten the ball rolling
with an investigation,

31:41.190 --> 31:43.026
because I take this matter
as seriously as you do.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.112
-I appreciate that.
-And because I don’t want you

31:46.195 --> 31:48.406
to feel as though it requires
your personal intervention.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.910
Yeah well, the only thing is
I really can’t sit back

31:51.993 --> 31:53.870
on something that involves my family.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.873
I can’t be all that confident
that other people are taking care of it.

31:57.165 --> 32:01.294
-Other people are taking care of it.
-Maybe I could just hold onto this,

32:01.377 --> 32:03.504
so when I’m working the phones,
I got it in front of me.

32:05.506 --> 32:06.549
Sure.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.362
How do you know I didn’t find
the money in a dumpster?

32:27.612 --> 32:28.863
We do this for a living, Parks.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.074
BALDWIN:
Plus, we got you going to a drugstore

32:31.157 --> 32:33.284
with Tracy Gilchrist
at three o'clock in the morning.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.288
She needed saline solution
for her contacts. I took her to get it.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.666
That and the money
tie you to the kidnapping.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.960
There wasn’t any kidnapping.
It was a setup.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.629
Well, if that’s true Parks,
then all we have to deal with is the girl.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.756
-What about the girl?
-The girl’s dead.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.927
Oh, no, you don’t.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.304
We’re open to hearing
an explanation for it.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.224
-You just gotta be straight with us.
-I’m not taking a rap

32:56.307 --> 32:57.517
for a murder. I'll tell you that.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.311
Right now, your girlfriend’s upstairs
looking to help herself.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.855
Now, you might want to think
about how to help yourself.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.149
This was supposed to be easy.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.486
This guy, Todd, maps out a situation
where we can make some money,

33:08.695 --> 33:10.780
wasn’t even criminal. Great? Good.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.866
Next thing, the chick trips a circuit,
and Sam went off.

33:14.367 --> 33:17.787
-How did she do that?
-We smoked this hash,

33:18.079 --> 33:20.999
started talking about these different,
weird jobs that we all had.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.751
It got around
to this phone-sex thing that uh...

33:24.043 --> 33:25.086
What’s her name?

33:25.378 --> 33:26.963
-Tracy.
-Tracy did.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.715
Todd says, "Give us a sample."

33:29.382 --> 33:31.092
She says some stupid lines
that they have her say

33:31.175 --> 33:32.510
to these losers that call.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.179
Next thing I know,
Sam on account of she’s nuts,

33:35.555 --> 33:37.807
-thinks I’m getting off on it.
-What happened then?

33:38.141 --> 33:40.143
She tells me to take Todd
out to this place in Brooklyn,

33:40.226 --> 33:41.769
so if they follow us
from picking up the money,

33:41.853 --> 33:43.604
we’re not coming back
to his girlfriend’s apartment.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.189
Made sense to me, so I did it.

33:45.648 --> 33:49.652
-She must have killed her after we left.
-And the kidnapping was Todd’s idea?

33:49.819 --> 33:50.820
Right from the jump.

33:52.613 --> 33:55.825
Correct me if I’m wrong,
but the kidnapping wasn’t a kidnapping,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.453
and the murder wasn’t done by me with me,
with me not on the premises

33:58.536 --> 34:01.247
at the time it was done,
I’m good to go, no?

34:01.414 --> 34:03.583

any ironclad assurances,

34:03.916 --> 34:07.336

with taking that position at the outset.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.019
Puts the homicide on the girl,
said the kidnapping was a hoax.

34:23.227 --> 34:25.021
-Todd’s idea.
-BALDWIN: Right.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.439
Like you said all along.

34:29.776 --> 34:32.695
-You two gonna work things out?
-Eventually, probably.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.323
-Be a shame if you didn’t.
-No, we will.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.119
What’d you find out?

34:41.287 --> 34:43.247
It’s manufactured
in Western Massachusetts.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.292
It is the top-of-the-line
microphone transmitter this company makes.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.794
Where is it sold, John?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.421
-There’s a number of places unfortunately.
-How many?

34:50.880 --> 34:53.299
-In New York?
-Right John, let's start with New York.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.760
In New York, there are 14.
Would you like me to list them?

34:56.761 --> 34:58.012
Sure, thanks.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.229
We have a feeling
the idea for the kidnapping

35:06.312 --> 35:08.022
-didn’t start with you.
-You got that right.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.316
-So it was Parks?
-Parks gets a headache

35:10.399 --> 35:12.235
he thinks of anything that complicated.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.779
No, that yuppie asshole,
Todd, thought it up,

35:14.862 --> 35:16.531
walked us through, and we went for it.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.324
How does the girl figure into all of this?

35:18.574 --> 35:20.827
-She’s Todd’s girlfriend.
-How’d she wind up being killed?

35:21.327 --> 35:22.703
I don’t know anything about that.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.123
So it was outside the scope
of the plan in other words?

35:25.206 --> 35:28.042
Until right now,
I didn’t even realize it happened.

35:28.918 --> 35:32.797
-Who would be responsible, you think?
-Maybe her boyfriend did it, I don’t know.

35:33.339 --> 35:36.676
Samantha, you’re in a bad spot right now.
Your boyfriend said he left you alone

35:36.759 --> 35:39.971
with Tracy in her apartment,
and I suspect Todd’s gonna back him up.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.348
Which means you get stuck
taking the rap for both of ’em.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.433
RITA: If it was a struggle
between you and Tracy,

35:44.517 --> 35:46.894
and it got out of hand,
that’s a lot less of a rap.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.230
But you gotta tell us,
that’s what happened.

35:53.693 --> 35:58.447
I would have liked to do it on the phone.
Sit in your kitchen, say some dirty words

35:58.531 --> 36:00.867
to somebody who ain’t even there
and get paid for it?

36:01.742 --> 36:03.703
I had to go into motel rooms with ’em.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.580
I had to go in cars with ’em.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.833
I had to go wherever that stupid bastard
set it up for me to go.

36:09.375 --> 36:12.795
Now some artsy-fartsy college girl’s
gonna humiliate me?

36:13.171 --> 36:14.547
By getting him turned on?

36:14.964 --> 36:17.925
Him and his new yuppie friend?
I don’t think so.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.678
That’s why you sent
your boyfriend and Todd away?

36:20.928 --> 36:22.930
That’s right. As far as I’m concerned,

36:23.055 --> 36:25.266
it’s on them what I did,
whether they were there or not.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.190
Why’d you lie about Tracy, Todd?

36:32.940 --> 36:36.360
Because I felt guilty that
I exposed her to these people.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.779
Even though she was gone
before I got hit with the pipe,

36:39.113 --> 36:41.866
I just didn’t want her
to be involved with any trials

36:42.116 --> 36:43.367
or inquiries or whatever.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.620
It must be even worse
when you found out she was dead.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.496
You can’t imagine
what I’m going through right now.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.833
See, Todd, the problem is
what we’re getting is that the kidnapping

36:50.958 --> 36:52.001
was your idea.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.836
That’s what they’re telling you

36:53.920 --> 36:55.963
because it gets them
off the hook, obviously.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.715
Hard as this may be to believe,

36:57.840 --> 37:01.385
but even a couple of dumb cops
like us might suspect that.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.640
But when we get two people
telling the same story independently,

37:05.723 --> 37:09.435
and one of them confesses to a homicide,
we’re inclined to believe them.

37:10.519 --> 37:11.520
All right, look.

37:12.813 --> 37:16.192
My father and I
have a very complicated relationship.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.320
He sets himself up as this,

37:19.695 --> 37:22.657
"caring, I can’t do enough for my kids,"
kind of father,

37:23.115 --> 37:24.784
but he lets you know
when you disappoint him.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.621
He lets you know when you’re not living up
to his ideal of the perfect son.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.791
You must have been pretty hurt
to go to the lengths you went to.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.211
I was just sick and tired of him
looking at me like I was worthless.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.089
So, you came up with this plan
and brought your girlfriend along?

37:39.423 --> 37:42.551
And that is something for which
I will never forgive myself.

-The kid’s a collar.
-He went for it?

37:57.191 --> 37:58.734
He went for setting up the kidnapping.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.112
-Then he goes for the homicide.
-Since he wasn’t there

38:01.195 --> 38:03.406
when the girl was killed,
There’s half a shot he’ll beat it.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.784
-Which would be a shame.
-One of you will fill in the father?

38:06.993 --> 38:08.119
I’ll take care of it.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.458
-(SIGHS) Mr. Garvin?
-Where's Todd?

38:16.419 --> 38:18.879
The kidnapping was
your son’s idea, Mr. Garvin.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.258
-He’s under arrest.
-We said we didn’t want to prosecute.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.553
His girlfriend was murdered
by one of the people he enlisted.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.596
That makes him responsible as well.

38:28.055 --> 38:31.309
-His girlfriend was murdered?
-Did Todd participate in her murder?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.270
I’m not gonna go into any specifics
with you, counselor.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.480
If he didn’t participate,
and it wasn’t foreseeable,

38:36.814 --> 38:39.150
chances are nobody’s gonna hang
a murder charge on him.

38:41.193 --> 38:43.487
-Can I see him?
-He’s being processed now.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.699
When we get ready to take him to court,
I’ll let you know. You can see him then.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.367
JOHN: It’s not your fault Mr. Garvin.

38:48.617 --> 38:52.163

your son brought it upon himself.

I mean you know I feel bad it happened.

How bad are you gonna feel
when this asshole, McClintock,

39:55.726 --> 39:57.395
beats some other poor girl to death?

39:58.562 --> 39:59.647

I don’t want to work with you no more.

How about I see you in the morning?
You can tell me all about it.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.866
I’m not kidding around with you, John.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.702
You gonna dump me as a partner over this?

40:13.953 --> 40:15.287
-Yeah.
-Shame on you!

40:15.413 --> 40:16.497
It’s not something I wanna do.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.833
Yeah, it is.

at your own part in it.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.382
You’re cutting me loose for nothing.

40:26.632 --> 40:29.385
Because you want to,
because it makes you feel better.

40:29.468 --> 40:30.886
-No.
-Yeah, you’re a phony,

40:31.011 --> 40:32.138
Andy, and I’m onto you.

Yeah. Well, good.
You don’t want me as a partner?

40:38.477 --> 40:39.812
I don’t want you as a partner.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.398
-Simple, we get a divorce.
