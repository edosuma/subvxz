it's a fitting name.

it's thawed,

it's frozen.

-Um...

02:18.361 --> 02:19.999

-Yeah.

[narrator] <i> Before he can sta</i>

10:33.201 --> 10:36.239

10:45.641 --> 10:47.759
<i> Building the road to freedo</i>

10:47.834 --> 10:50.719
<i> now relies on Fred</i>

10:50.721 --> 10:53.559
<i> to transport his monster</i>
<i> earth-moving machine</i>

10:53.561 --> 10:56.759
<i> to California Creek</i>
<i> as fast as possible.</i>

10:56.761 --> 10:59.439
It's quite a distance,
probably about
a seven-hour trip.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.639
Maneuvering to get
that dozer up there...

11:01.714 --> 11:03.519
Up in the Yukon,
finding a bulldozer

11:03.521 --> 11:07.919
is easier than finding someone
to transport said bulldozer.

11:07.994 --> 11:10.319
[narrator] <i> Working capital</i>
<i> almost spent,</i>

11:10.321 --> 11:12.799

11:15.201 --> 11:16.759
I'm headed out
to the one man I know...

11:17.401 --> 11:18.799
We gotta start stripping.

11:18.874 --> 11:20.799
That's the key. If we
can't strip, we can't mine.

11:30.241 --> 11:31.919
There's always so much
going on here.

11:31.921 --> 11:34.199
[narrator] <i> Fred Lewis's</i>

<i> 150 miles to his claim.</i>

11:41.161 --> 11:43.239
All right. Do or die.

11:49.121 --> 11:50.839
Tony!

11:53.361 --> 11:55.079
All clean this year.

11:55.154 --> 11:56.599
How you doing?

11:57.681 --> 11:58.599
Great, actually.

11:58.601 --> 12:00.399
Yeah.

12:02.641 --> 12:05.839
Well, we haven't really gotten
started yet, Tony. Um...

12:05.914 --> 12:08.199
That river's not letting go
any time soon.

12:08.274 --> 12:10.479
It's basically the beginning
of the season for us.

12:10.554 --> 12:11.599
So the biggest thing
for me this season

12:11.601 --> 12:12.959
was finding a dozer.

12:12.961 --> 12:15.719
I found one, but in order
to get up there on the claim

12:15.721 --> 12:17.759
and start stripping,
I gotta get it out there.

12:17.761 --> 12:20.719
Then shopping around
for someone to transport it,

12:20.721 --> 12:23.479
road vans,
everyone's super busy,

12:23.481 --> 12:25.039
I'm striking out.

12:25.681 --> 12:27.199
To be honest, outside of you,

12:27.274 --> 12:29.799
I don't really have a lot
of connections in the area.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.719
So that's what's landed
me here.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.719
So do you think
there's something
we can make for a deal?

12:41.601 --> 12:42.959
Yeah, it's 50.

12:56.681 --> 12:58.359
Okay.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.319
Okay.

13:03.361 --> 13:04.399
Awesome,
I really appreciate it.

13:07.481 --> 13:09.119
Awesome.

13:12.361 --> 13:13.599
Okay.

13:18.841 --> 13:19.799
Okay.

13:20.721 --> 13:21.919
Okay.

13:26.121 --> 13:28.519
All right, awesome.
So I'll talk to Troy.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.999
All right. I appreciate it.

13:33.561 --> 13:35.599
All right. Thank you, Tony.

13:38.881 --> 13:40.159
<i> I'm on cloud nine right now</i>

13:40.234 --> 13:42.199
This was probably
the biggest fear we had,

13:42.201 --> 13:44.119
was not being able to get
our dozer out to our claim.

13:44.121 --> 13:46.119
We couldn't find anybody.

13:46.121 --> 13:47.839
But once again,
the king of the Klondike,

13:47.841 --> 13:51.199
Tony Beets, hooks us up.

13:51.274 --> 13:52.839
You know,
what Tony's just done for us

13:52.841 --> 13:54.919

the biggest problem we have.

23:38.081 --> 23:40.679
I think we should
put this back together.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.799
Once we put some tension
on the track tensioner,

23:43.841 --> 23:46.239
the piston should hold
the tracks snug enough

I'm gonna start putting grease
in these tracks

25:57.361 --> 25:58.879
and see if we can get them

25:58.954 --> 26:00.599
snugged up
to where they need to be.

26:08.241 --> 26:09.199
Okay, go ahead.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.039
[engine revs]

26:15.841 --> 26:18.119
It's looking all right.

26:18.194 --> 26:21.599
Yeah, just walk it around
a bit, back and forth.

26:23.921 --> 26:26.199
It's looking good.
You can cruise.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.959
Like, this thing can
walk around no problem.

26:31.961 --> 26:34.799
It can dig pay, like, actually
better than I thought.

26:34.874 --> 26:37.279
But, yeah,
don't billy-goat it around.

26:37.281 --> 26:40.199
[Taylor] Yeah.
Hey Mitch, you got a copy?

26:40.274 --> 26:41.719
[Mitch on radio] <i> Yeah, go.</i>

26:41.761 --> 26:43.959
Hey, you wanna come
pick up this 480?

26:44.001 --> 26:46.279
[Mitch] <i> Is she ready to go?</i>

26:46.354 --> 26:47.799
She's ready to go for you.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.959
You gotta make [bleep] work.

26:49.961 --> 26:51.319
We got a tensioner in there

26:51.361 --> 26:53.119
that's blasted
in three pieces.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.279
But it's holding
the tracks tight,

26:55.281 --> 26:58.639
and it'll probably do its job
until the new parts arrive.

27:08.481 --> 27:11.599
[Mitch] Ty did an awesome job
getting the 480 fixed up here.

27:11.674 --> 27:14.079
I know it wasn't an easy fix,
but she's back rolling.

27:24.001 --> 27:26.559

28:23.241 --> 28:25.879
I'll do as much as I can
with what I got.

28:25.881 --> 28:28.239
You can't expect
much more than that.

28:29.161 --> 28:30.839
[Megan] <i> The D6 is all down.</i>

28:30.841 --> 28:32.999

29:43.721 --> 29:45.959
[Kevin] Yeah, there's just
so much space.

29:45.961 --> 29:48.919
[Michael] Especially when you
want to make something.

29:48.921 --> 29:53.839

30:08.561 --> 30:09.912
[Kevin] We should.

30:09.914 --> 30:13.799
You may have to go...
to the next goodie pile.

30:16.881 --> 30:17.919
Ooh!

30:18.601 --> 30:20.059
Yep, we got it.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.145
We're gonna need it pretty bad

get this done and get
this done right.

30:40.801 --> 30:45.199
<i> It's also my first time,</i>
<i> so we'll see how it goes.</i>

30:45.201 --> 30:47.039
We're using a chain
on this end.

30:47.041 --> 30:51.039
And then we put the chain
over the track frame
to the back.

30:51.041 --> 30:54.439
And then that's how
we're gonna pull
the whole track over

30:54.441 --> 30:56.719
to the track frame
towards the sprocket.

31:00.841 --> 31:02.639
Yeah, well, for us,
it's all new.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.859
We're still learning a lot.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.839
I'm thinking of using
the come-a-long
to pull the tracks.

31:20.921 --> 31:24.159
It's a little safer
and you won't damage anything.

31:37.361 --> 31:38.919
It's not tight.

31:38.921 --> 31:41.959
[narrator] <i> The novice mechan</i>

[Kevin] <i> He can't connect</i>

31:52.627 --> 31:56.159
There's no way you're gonna
use the come-a-long to pull
that track from here

31:56.161 --> 31:58.679
underneath all that way,
it's just not gonna happen.

31:58.721 --> 32:01.399
So, disconnect this,
drop it down.

32:01.401 --> 32:04.079
Gonna fire up the catch,
then we're gonna go
in reverse.

32:04.081 --> 32:06.159
-Yep.
-But we're not gonna
run that track.

32:06.161 --> 32:11.439
It'll cause this to spin back.
Till we get it to, ah, I'd say
right about here.

32:11.441 --> 32:13.959
And then we'll slap
[bleep] together.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.199
[clanks]

32:23.681 --> 32:25.879
-Okay. You ready?
-[Michael] Yeah.

32:25.881 --> 32:27.119
[Kevin] Open up the throttle.

32:41.681 --> 32:42.759
Okay.

32:58.881 --> 33:00.359
Piece of cake.

33:02.521 --> 33:04.279

33:04.281 --> 33:06.279

back out to the dump.

33:06.281 --> 33:10.399

a little bad,
so [bleep] perfect.

We're throwing everything
we can to get
all this dirt moved.

This section's almost
pretty much done.

33:32.641 --> 33:36.599
[woman] The D6 is fixed.
Shoulder dump is
now open again.

33:36.601 --> 33:39.519
Now we can haul more dirt out
a lot faster.

33:40.841 --> 33:44.239
[Mike] Had a bit of a hiccup
but, uh, we got it here
in the end.

33:44.241 --> 33:46.799
All in all, everything going
quite nicely here.

33:52.801 --> 33:54.079
[Tony speaking]

33:54.154 --> 33:55.199
Oh, yeah.

34:02.881 --> 34:04.539
There are little bits
here and there,

we're starting to hit pay
all around.

[Fred] So does
this whole thing
come off or...

35:15.281 --> 35:17.759
[Troy] All we have to do
is take the trunnion caps off,

35:17.761 --> 35:19.959
put some blocks under here,

35:19.961 --> 35:22.879
take the four bolts off,

-[JB] Hey, we got
an issue over here, man.
-Already?

35:39.434 --> 35:43.639
[JB] I tried
with the breaker bar
and I frickin'

35:43.641 --> 35:46.039
-snapped.
-Well, you broke
the breaker bar.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.399
-It's like rusted in place.
-Yeah, yeah.

35:50.401 --> 35:53.479
Got these trunnion caps
that need to come off
and all these are super tight

35:53.554 --> 35:55.399
and probably rusted in place,

35:55.401 --> 35:58.239
so we could be up
[bleep] creek without
a paddle at this point.

35:58.241 --> 36:01.759
Uh, we've got the trailer
coming to pick this up today.

36:01.761 --> 36:03.479

we're on borrowed time,

to solve these problems

and hope we don't
[bleep] ourselves.

the blade off,

they're probably gonna
turn around and leave.

37:06.761 --> 37:08.919
It might be exactly
what we need

37:08.921 --> 37:11.199

multiply our torque.
-Times four, yes.

quite a bit of time to go get
the tools we need, so...

the other side.

everything in the front.

is the hardest part.

39:19.241 --> 39:21.959
So we're gonna go
to the grass patch.

39:21.961 --> 39:24.799
Which is my favorite place
on this mine site.

39:24.874 --> 39:27.599
It's meant to be peaceful
except I kind of
am always stressing

39:27.674 --> 39:29.639
about [bleep] bears
that are everywhere,

39:29.714 --> 39:32.399
but I try and block them out
for the 15 minutes
I'm down there.

39:35.761 --> 39:37.585
-Hello.
-[dogs growl]

39:37.587 --> 39:40.359
We've got nine dogs
running around,
so it's always a bit chaotic.

39:40.361 --> 39:41.639
This is Cheeker and Isla.

39:41.641 --> 39:43.959
I really do have to start
my day with a workout.

39:43.961 --> 39:46.039
Just because I'm in machinery
all day

39:46.081 --> 39:48.399
and being in a machine
is like being in a washing
machine.

39:48.401 --> 39:50.799
You just get thrown around,
it's just a lot on the body.

39:50.874 --> 39:53.112
<i> That's why this is</i>
<i> so important.</i>

39:54.441 --> 39:58.679
It's funny, I've asked Parker
to come and do, um, Pilates
or a morning workout with me

39:58.721 --> 40:02.599
and, um, the answer is,
"Absolutely, no."
He just laughs in my face.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.632
But it'll happen one day.

40:12.361 --> 40:14.919
[Fred] <i> Ah, right now,</i>
<i> we're probably any minute</i>
<i> for Mikey Beets</i>

40:14.921 --> 40:18.719
getting here with the truck
to move the blade
and the dozer.

40:18.721 --> 40:21.039
We're trying to get
the last pieces unattached.

40:21.041 --> 40:22.559
Just these two pins here

40:22.634 --> 40:24.479
have to come out
and it's ready to go.

40:24.481 --> 40:27.119
But we wanna get
all that stuff done and ready
before they get here,

40:27.121 --> 40:29.879
so they're not waiting around.
They can load it and go.

40:29.921 --> 40:31.865
[narrator] <i> Mike Beets</i>

40:31.867 --> 40:37.759

40:43.121 --> 40:44.519
How's it going, guys?

40:44.521 --> 40:45.992
Oh, good. Yourself?

40:45.994 --> 40:47.799
-[Fred] Good.
Ready to do this.
-[JB] How you doing?

40:47.801 --> 40:50.199
[Fred] So what you think
the game plan's gonna be?

40:50.201 --> 40:53.679
Well, I got the low boy
and that's gonna be
the easiest thing to load

40:53.754 --> 40:56.279
'cause all I have to do
is drop the neck and we can
drive the thing on...

40:56.281 --> 40:58.279
Uh, your blade's gonna
be a pain in the ass

40:58.354 --> 41:00.759
because all we got
is a loader.

41:00.801 --> 41:02.799
But everything else
we can get easy peasy.

41:02.801 --> 41:05.519
-Okay.
-So if, uh...

41:05.521 --> 41:08.359
You do the neck.
You drive the dozer on for me.

41:08.361 --> 41:09.959
You want me to drive
the dozer on?

41:10.034 --> 41:11.399
[Mike] Well, yeah.
It's your dozer.

41:11.474 --> 41:12.399
All right, it's your trailer.

41:12.401 --> 41:13.999
Uh, it's not hard.

41:14.001 --> 41:15.919
If you can drive
in a straight line,
you can do it.

41:15.921 --> 41:17.159
All right. We'll find out.

41:17.801 --> 41:18.939
All right. Let's do it.

41:18.941 --> 41:19.839
-[Mike grunts]
-[JB] All right. Let's go.

41:20.641 --> 41:22.039
[machinery whirring]

41:42.441 --> 41:43.632
You ready?

41:44.681 --> 41:46.639
[narrator]
<i> Blade successfully loaded..</i>

41:46.714 --> 41:47.545
[Fred] I'm in!

41:47.547 --> 41:49.672
Make sure everybody's back.

41:49.674 --> 41:53.759
[narrator] <i> ...it's time</i>
<i> for Fred to show Mike</i>
<i> and Len his driving skills.</i>

41:58.681 --> 42:00.639
[Fred] <i> I'm a little bit</i>

42:00.641 --> 42:02.719
<i> Uh, I've never really</i>
<i> driven a dozer more</i>
<i> than a couple of feet.</i>

42:23.841 --> 42:25.599
[Len] Beautiful.

42:25.674 --> 42:28.159
You'll leave it
exactly how it is.

42:28.161 --> 42:30.359
Next step is to, uh,
put some chains on it

42:30.361 --> 42:31.519
and get it the hell
out of here.

42:35.801 --> 42:37.499
[Fred] Think that's it
though, right?

42:37.501 --> 42:39.439
We're all battened down,
ready to roll.
You guys can bounce.

42:39.441 --> 42:41.679
And next time
we see this thing,
it's gonna be on our claim.

42:41.754 --> 42:42.919
-Yeah, right.
-Appreciate it.

42:42.994 --> 42:44.859
[laughs] See you, guys.

42:44.861 --> 42:47.839
[narrator] <i> The dozer is</i>
<i> on its way to Tony's yard</i>

42:47.954 --> 42:50.239

42:50.241 --> 42:52.799

42:52.801 --> 42:56.959
<i> But the Lewis crew</i>

42:56.961 --> 42:58.545
Well, that was
a hell of a day.

42:58.621 --> 43:00.719
Definitely a lot harder
than I thought it was
gonna be.

43:00.721 --> 43:03.719
<i> We had to do some</i>
<i> quick thinking,</i>
<i> but we got it going.</i>

43:03.721 --> 43:06.039
Right now, it's on its way.
Time to get to gold.

43:15.681 --> 43:17.879
-[Chris] <i> Howdy.</i>
-[Mitch] <i> What's</i>
<i> happening, man?</i>

43:17.921 --> 43:19.599
-Cleaning gold, buddy.
-Yeah?

43:19.601 --> 43:21.759
-Hopefully, lots of it.
-Lots of it, I wish.

43:21.834 --> 43:23.279
-Hey, T.
-Hey, Doumitt.

43:23.281 --> 43:24.879
-[Chris] How you doing, buddy?
-Good, how are you?

43:24.954 --> 43:26.159
-Good.
-That's good.

43:26.161 --> 43:28.559
And you guys are stripping
the Bear cut now?

43:28.561 --> 43:30.399
-[Mitch] Yep.
-[Chris] How's it going
down there?

43:30.401 --> 43:34.559
Had a busy week.
We saw a bear down there,
it kept cruising around.

43:35.121 --> 43:36.759
[Chris] Hey, young man.

43:36.761 --> 43:37.839
[Mitch] So...

43:39.801 --> 43:42.479
Well, this is
our first full week

43:42.481 --> 43:45.999
on the old Easy Street,
we'll see if it lives up
to its name.

43:46.074 --> 43:48.439
What do you think
about the Bear cut there,
Tyson?

43:48.441 --> 43:51.119
Lots of, uh, stuck trucks
on that ramp.

43:51.121 --> 43:52.272
Yeah, definitely.

43:52.347 --> 43:55.279
We had Tatiana...
Had that tire let go.

43:55.281 --> 43:57.879
-Yeah.
-Man, if she's having trouble
getting around out there...

43:57.921 --> 43:59.639
She's got a lot of experience
on those rock trucks.

43:59.641 --> 44:01.319
She knows how to get 'em
through stuff.

44:01.394 --> 44:04.319
And then, 480 blew
the track off it

44:04.321 --> 44:06.319
and we had to put
all that back together, so...

44:06.321 --> 44:07.879
Bad things come in threes.

44:07.954 --> 44:09.679
[all laughing]

44:09.681 --> 44:10.959
Well, hopefully, that's all
of it, right?

44:11.034 --> 44:12.479
Yeah.

44:12.481 --> 44:14.679
Big Red had a good week.
I mean, it plugged
right along.

44:14.721 --> 44:17.599
-Well, Doumitt will tell us
if it had a good week or not.
-[Parker] Yeah.

44:17.674 --> 44:20.319
It did its job anyway.
I mean, hopefully,
there's some gold in it.

44:20.321 --> 44:23.159
-So, all in all...
-Are you ready, Mitchell?
All in all, Mitchell.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.919
-We sluiced all week.
-[Chris] Sluiced all week.

44:24.961 --> 44:26.999
[Mitch] We moved
a bunch of mud.

44:27.001 --> 44:28.519
We definitely had
some problems.

44:28.881 --> 44:30.619
We worked our way through 'em.

44:30.621 --> 44:32.799
-Do we have any gold
to show for it?
-Well, here. You tell me.

44:32.801 --> 44:36.759
[narrator] <i> It's the first</i>
<i> full week's run</i>
<i> for Easy Street</i>

44:36.761 --> 44:40.199
<i> and the crew's hoping</i>
<i> for at least 200 ounces.</i>

44:40.201 --> 44:42.119
Come here.

44:42.121 --> 44:44.319
-Ready?
-All right. Let's see.
What do you got?

44:46.481 --> 44:50.119
Twenty, 30, 50, 70, 80,

44:50.841 --> 44:52.799
100, 120,

44:52.874 --> 44:55.999
130... Oh, is that it?

44:56.074 --> 44:56.919
[Chris] That's it.

44:56.921 --> 45:00.239
139.30.

45:00.314 --> 45:05.159
[narrator] <i> Worth just</i>
<i> over $250,000.</i>

45:05.161 --> 45:07.919
One thirty-nine,
not quite 140.

45:07.921 --> 45:10.599
Yeah, first run's
are usually crappy.

45:11.641 --> 45:14.119
Probably hardly covers
the fuel bill for a week.

45:16.321 --> 45:17.999
Where's that put us?

45:18.074 --> 45:21.039
Last week it was 230 ounces.

45:21.041 --> 45:22.225
[Mitch] Yeah.

45:22.301 --> 45:25.479
[Chris] This week
it's 140, so about half.

45:25.554 --> 45:27.359
But for the season total,

45:27.361 --> 45:30.959
it's 1,343.75.

45:32.001 --> 45:33.719
It's still early.
We're still in good shape.

45:33.721 --> 45:35.399
[Mitch]
Where were we last year?

45:35.401 --> 45:39.359
We're around 860 ounces.

45:39.434 --> 45:41.359
-[Mitch] A little bit
of a jump on it.
-[Chris] Yeah.

45:41.361 --> 45:42.399
But yeah, we're getting there.

45:42.401 --> 45:44.039
Once we have
two plants running,

45:44.074 --> 45:45.659
the rate at which we're doing,

45:45.661 --> 45:47.879
getting through ground
is gonna, like,
more than double.

45:47.881 --> 45:51.719
[Chris] Another couple
of weeks, man.
Can't stop now.

45:51.721 --> 45:53.959
-[Parker] All right,
thanks, guys.
-[Tyson laughs] Later.

45:53.961 --> 45:55.599
[Chris] Okay,
we'll catch you guys later.

46:08.721 --> 46:10.799
-[Minnie] Hi, guys.
-Hi, everybody.

46:10.801 --> 46:11.959
[baby babbles]

46:18.841 --> 46:20.279
How was everybody's week?

46:20.321 --> 46:21.479
Some ups and downs.

46:21.481 --> 46:23.439
Mostly a D6 that went down.

46:23.441 --> 46:26.759
-What happened?
-Uh, a track came off
and all that goo.

46:26.761 --> 46:28.379
So, that was fun.

46:28.381 --> 46:30.719
-[Minnie] We kept
on sluicing though, Mike.
-[Mike] Yeah.

46:30.721 --> 46:33.759
Regardless
of what else happens,
that plant keeps on turning.

46:33.761 --> 46:34.959
[Tony speaking]

46:40.961 --> 46:43.159
-[Minnie] I think so.
-[Tony speaking]

46:44.361 --> 46:45.399
-[Tony laughs]
-[Kevin] Yep.

46:46.001 --> 46:46.999
Cool.

46:47.001 --> 46:48.759
-[Tony speaking]
-Ready?

46:48.801 --> 46:50.719
Three, two, one. Let's go.

46:50.721 --> 46:55.319
[narrator] <i> To stay on target</i>
<i> Tony needs at least</i>
<i> 215 ounces.</i>

It is what it is.
You're not going to change it.

47:23.201 --> 47:24.959
[Tony speaking]

47:27.721 --> 47:29.279
That's what I said earlier.

47:29.354 --> 47:31.039
[woman] So what's our total?

47:31.041 --> 47:34.639
-Ah, we have roughly
828 ounces right now.
-[Tony] Okay.

47:34.641 --> 47:36.719
I mean, hell, we're still
in 12 hour days,

47:36.721 --> 47:39.239
I mean, it doesn't take much
to double up.

47:39.314 --> 47:42.199
There's still lots of room
to play, guys, aye?

47:42.201 --> 47:43.345
-[Kevin] Oh, yes.
-Oh, yeah.

47:43.347 --> 47:44.859
[Kevin] Sandbox
is still pretty full.

47:44.861 --> 47:48.199
Speaking of which,
this probably means
we gotta vamoose.

47:48.274 --> 47:50.159
[Tony] Yeah, probably
should get back out.

47:50.161 --> 47:52.839
-[Kevin] Let's go.
-Okay, let's do it.

47:54.441 --> 47:56.359
Let's go, Mike.
We got [bleep] to do.

47:56.434 --> 47:57.719
Oh, yeah.
