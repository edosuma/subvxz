01:15.553 --> 01:18.034
I started dating Beth Ann
in high school.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.560
She used to make me sandwiches
and sew buttons on my shirts.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.562
I tell you, there's nothing
sexier than a girl

01:24.606 --> 01:27.739
who likes to take care of you.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.741
I was introduced to Simone
at a benefit.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.614
Oh, the entrance she made.

01:32.657 --> 01:35.965
Designer gown,
dripping in diamonds.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.054
You could tell
from the way she walked,

01:38.098 --> 01:40.665
she knew she was fabulous.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.841
I first saw Taylor
at a women's march.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.888
She was giving a speech about
dismantling the patriarchy.

01:45.931 --> 01:48.064
And I don't really remember much
of it, because the entire time

01:48.108 --> 01:50.893
she was speaking,
I was just thinking,

01:50.936 --> 01:54.026
"That is one hot feminist."

01:54.070 --> 01:56.116
Beth Ann was a virgin
on our wedding night.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.900
I was Simone's third husband.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.728
Right away,
Taylor told me she was bisexual.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.122
She wanted nothing more
than to be a housewife.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.862
Oh, she loved to shop
and throw parties.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.429
So I married a lawyer.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.475
My Jewish parents were thrilled.

02:07.518 --> 02:11.435
We were very happy,
for the first few years.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.958
Until she discovered my secret.

02:13.002 --> 02:17.833
And then, all hell broke loose.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.158
Can you believe it?

02:38.201 --> 02:41.161
Oh, Rob. It's lovely.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.598
Damn straight.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.208
And it's so big.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.776
Well, it's a mansion,
is what it is.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.125
Yeah, you're married to a guy

02:49.169 --> 02:51.649
who can afford
a goddamn mansion.

02:52.911 --> 02:53.869
BETH ANN:
Oh.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.176
Hello.SHEILA: Hello.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.003
Sheila Mosconi.
This is my husband, Leo.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.528
LEO:
I guess you're
our new neighbors.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.705
I must apologize for
my husband's language.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.055
He's excited because we've never
lived anywhere this nice before.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.840
He doesn't usually swear.SHEILA: Relax.

03:08.884 --> 03:11.800
We're from Brooklyn.Yeah. We don't give a fuck.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.498
Yes.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.892
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.198
After you unpack,

03:18.241 --> 03:20.025
invite us over.
I'll give you the skinny

03:20.069 --> 03:22.027
on all the neighbors.
You know, who to avoid.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.247
She just wants to see if your
furniture's nicer than ours.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.901
I married a tightwad.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.817
I know that her furniture
is nicer than ours.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.862
The moving men
will be here any second.

03:30.906 --> 03:34.257
After they're done,
we would love to host you.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.958
I saw you talking
to the neighbors.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.091
What are they like?

03:42.134 --> 03:44.528
Italian.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.617
Oh...

04:11.947 --> 04:14.689
Karl?

04:15.733 --> 04:16.734
Karl?

04:16.778 --> 04:18.736
I'm in here, Simone.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.086
Oh. The phone is going
to ring any second.

04:21.130 --> 04:24.307
It'll be Henri, my hairdresser,
and he will be livid.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.830
What have you done?I'm 20 minutes late.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.832
Again. He's gonna try to say

04:27.876 --> 04:29.269
he's given away
my appointment.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.619
Don't let him.
Insist I left an hour ago,

04:31.662 --> 04:33.055
and that you're
beyond frantic.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.623
Can you do that, darling?
Can you lie for me?

04:35.666 --> 04:37.233
Well, last week,
I told Delia Butrose

04:37.277 --> 04:39.104
you'd never had work done.Ah.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.281
This is why you're the best
husband I've ever had.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.021
I was just hoping
to be in the top three.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.806
Wish me luck.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.198
Hurry home.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.940
Our party starts at 7:00.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.942
You know me. I'm never late.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.380
For a party.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.242
Saul.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.984
My man.I just got your text. What's up?

05:33.028 --> 05:34.334
Actually, it's my wife.

05:34.377 --> 05:37.032
She requires a little face time.

05:37.075 --> 05:40.078
Geez.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.386
Hey, Saul.SAUL :
Hey.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.301
Hey. I just had a quick question

05:45.345 --> 05:47.042
about the blueprints
for the remodel.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.827
What seems to be the problem?Well, see,

05:49.871 --> 05:52.221
I asked for a window to be put
in the side of the building.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.266
but you put it in the back.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.181
Yeah. I had to do it
that way.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.140
Okay, but why?

05:58.183 --> 06:00.838
Well, it's a structural thing.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.931
It's hard to explain.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.237
Oh.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.239
Well, I'm a smart girl.
Give it a try.

06:10.282 --> 06:13.155
Relax, sweetheart,
it's gonna look great.

06:13.198 --> 06:16.811
Okay, Saul, here's what
I think is going on.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.769
You want to finish
this job quickly

06:18.813 --> 06:20.858
and move on to the next one,
and it's easier

06:20.902 --> 06:23.905
to put the window there
instead of where I want it.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.387
Am I right?

06:29.084 --> 06:31.391
I've been in construction
40 years.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.132
No one's ever questioned
my integrity.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.918
And until you can
speak my language,

06:36.961 --> 06:39.790
you're just gonna
have to trust me, sweetie.

06:41.183 --> 06:43.446
I may not understand
construction,

06:43.490 --> 06:47.102
but I do understand contracts.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.321
Especially the
one you signed,

06:49.365 --> 06:52.847
which clearly states
that I don't have to pay you

06:52.890 --> 06:54.414
unless the work is completed

06:54.457 --> 06:56.111
to my satisfaction.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.244
And that means,
for the purpose of this,

06:59.288 --> 07:01.290
and all future
conversations,

07:01.333 --> 07:04.119
my dick is bigger than yours.

07:06.164 --> 07:09.341
Am I speaking
your language now, Saul?

07:10.778 --> 07:12.736
Yes.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.782
Good.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.787
It's okay, man.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.963
Her dick's also
bigger than mine.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.834
You get used to it.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.837
I found the coasters. They were
in the last box I looked in.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.318
Sheila and Leo were just telling
me about the neighborhood.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.972
Oh, you are gonna love
the supermarket.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.278
It's five blocks away
and it's got everything.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.497
I can't wait.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.281
I have so much
shopping to do.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.936
And the schools here are
excellent. You guys got kids?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.113
Uh...

07:42.157 --> 07:43.245
no.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.116
Well, we have
four little rug rats.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.815
At some point, they are gonna
break something that you own.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.773
Not to worry.
We will pay for it.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.514
We make up for
being bad parents

07:51.558 --> 07:53.037
by being good neighbors.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.215
Rob,

07:57.259 --> 08:00.131
why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

08:00.175 --> 08:01.916
I don't know, Leo.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.527
I mean, your face
looks so familiar to me.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.311
What do you do
for a living?

08:06.355 --> 08:08.357
I'm in aerospace engineering.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.924
Ever hear of Cyther-Tech?

08:09.967 --> 08:11.447
No.
BETH ANN:
They have contracts

08:11.491 --> 08:12.970
with NASA.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.407
I help design rockets.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.801
I'm in dry cleaning, myself.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.368
Got four stores.

08:19.411 --> 08:22.806
Practically a chain.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.808
Sounds more impressive

08:24.852 --> 08:27.115
if no one's
been talking about rockets.

08:27.158 --> 08:30.031
Oh... Uh...

08:32.903 --> 08:35.123
Rob, can I say something?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.341
Sure. What's up?

08:36.385 --> 08:39.475
If you want more coffee,
ask for it.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.219
I beg your pardon?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.570
Just tapping on your cup?

08:47.614 --> 08:52.227
Come on. That's how you treat
a maid, not your wife.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.103
Okay.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.453
See-- this is my fault.
See, I bought Sheila

09:01.497 --> 09:03.412
a copy
of The Feminine Mystique.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.153
I-I thought it was a sex manual.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.635
She's been acting militant
ever since. Sorry.

09:12.334 --> 09:15.511
Honey, does my tapping
offend you?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.166
Of course not.

09:18.209 --> 09:21.169
Rob is such a
wonderful provider.

09:21.212 --> 09:25.042
I consider it an honor
to take care of him.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.438
See?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.135
She's happy.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.137
Didn't mean
to spoil the mood.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.009
Sorry, Rob.

09:35.052 --> 09:38.099
Apology accepted. To show
there's no hard feelings,

09:38.142 --> 09:40.580
next time you two are in
Glendale, stop by Cyther-Tech

09:40.623 --> 09:43.017
and I'll give you
the grand tour.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.627
You work in Glendale?

09:44.671 --> 09:46.586
Yeah. That's where we're based.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.283
Huh.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.158
Well, it's getting late.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.030
You guys have
unpacking to do,

09:56.073 --> 09:57.901
and we have kids to spank.Yeah.

09:57.945 --> 10:01.122
We're so happy to have
made two new friends.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.428
Ah, we feel the same way.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.995
Take care, Beth Ann.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.303
Rob.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.662
Simone! The house.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.925
It's finally done.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.101
My decorator finished Friday.
What do you think?

10:24.145 --> 10:26.408
I'm so jealous
I could kill myself.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.279
Oh. That's the look
I was going for.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.934
Darling, I got you a scotch.Oh...

10:30.978 --> 10:32.283
Thank you, my love.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.111
Don't I have the nicest husband?

10:34.155 --> 10:36.287
I don't know.
Ed died and left me six million.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.637
That was pretty nice.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.290
Oh. Where's Wanda?

10:39.334 --> 10:40.640
Didn't she come with you?

10:40.683 --> 10:42.642
Wanda couldn't make it.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.687
Oh. Why not?

10:44.731 --> 10:47.168
She's in a dark place lately.

10:47.211 --> 10:50.432
Charles is divorcing her
because she won't stop drinking.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.520
Oh, poor thing.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.133
Mom, I'm working.

10:56.177 --> 10:59.310
I'll pretend not to know you in
exchange for some cheese balls.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.660
How many do you want?

11:00.703 --> 11:02.139
Leave the tray.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.491
I feel so badly for Wanda.

11:06.535 --> 11:10.234
Why don't I throw
a lunch in her honor?

11:10.278 --> 11:12.367
Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:12.410 --> 11:15.500
I think she could use a show
of support from her friends.

11:15.544 --> 11:18.982
Honey, Wanda doesn't like you.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.506
You lie.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.378
Remember when we went
to Le Dôme?

11:23.421 --> 11:26.511
Charles had just moved out
the day before.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.513
Wanda was crushed.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.647
And I told delightful anecdotes
to make her laugh.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.170
Stories about
your trips to Italy

11:33.214 --> 11:35.303
and your thriving art gallery
and how much money

11:35.346 --> 11:37.000
you're spending
on your daughter's wedding.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.698
Misery loves company.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.047
You should've just said that

11:40.090 --> 11:41.222
your life isn't
so perfect either.

11:41.265 --> 11:44.007
But my life is perfect.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.706
That's exactly the type of thing
your friends don't want to hear.

11:51.319 --> 11:54.452
Simone?
Everything all right?

11:54.496 --> 11:57.717
Naomi says that

11:57.760 --> 11:59.762
Wanda doesn't like me.

11:59.806 --> 12:04.114
I'm just devastated.Oh, my poor darling.

12:04.158 --> 12:09.076
Here, would it help
to dance?

12:09.119 --> 12:11.556
I believe it would.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.043
TAYLOR:
Hey.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.566
Hey.

12:24.831 --> 12:28.095
Really? You want to throw
another jacket on that chair?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.314
I'm so tired.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.186
There's a coat rack right there.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.578
You're complaining about me?
There's three pairs

12:33.622 --> 12:35.232
of your pants hanging over
the side of the couch.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.234
Well, we don't have
a pants rack.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.628
Well, now you've ruined
your birthday surprise.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.461
Oh...Yeah, yeah.

12:46.504 --> 12:50.421
Get any writing done?

12:50.465 --> 12:53.642
A couple pages,
nothing much.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.864
That's something.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.606
Oh, what're we gonna do
about dinner?

13:01.650 --> 13:03.260
Oh, I was
thinking pizza.

13:03.304 --> 13:07.264
Ah. My mom
used to love pizza.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.267
What did you think
of her body?

13:10.311 --> 13:12.269
Salad it is.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.102
Hello? Hey, what's up?

13:19.146 --> 13:21.365
What?

13:21.409 --> 13:24.629
Okay, honey, honey,
calm down.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.154
No. Where is he now?

13:27.197 --> 13:29.765
No, I'll be right over.
Don't open the door.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.419
Who was that?

13:31.462 --> 13:34.161
My friend Jade.
She has this crazy ex

13:34.204 --> 13:35.727
who's been stalking her.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.469
So you're going over there?There's a car parked outside

13:38.513 --> 13:40.863
her condo. I'll check it out,
I'll come right back.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.126
You never mentioned Jade before.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.128
Well, she's a new friend.
Where are my keys?

13:45.172 --> 13:47.304
Oh... you fucking her?

13:47.348 --> 13:48.697
Yeah.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.134
What happened to Alicia?She moved back to Peru.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.615
How come you didn't tell me
you had a new hookup?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.312
Honey, we don't always share
that kind of stuff.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.879
I mean, are you seeing
anyone lately?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.663
No, no. I mean,
no one interesting.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.535
Oh.
Should I come with you?

14:00.578 --> 14:02.319
To do what?

14:02.363 --> 14:05.714
Well, if it's her ex and it
gets violent, I can, you know,

14:05.757 --> 14:07.455
I can scream for help.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.458
I adore you.Well, only 'cause
I'm adorable.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.591
Mm-hmm.
Mm.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.245
I'd like to keep
kissing you...

14:15.289 --> 14:17.334
But you have to go help
your lesbian lover.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.683
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.859
Okay.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.862
I'm ordering pizza.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.706
Honey, put that back.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.318
We don't need
any more cookies.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.362
I said no.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.941
WOMAN: You don't say.SHEILA: They invited us
over for coffee.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.291
So, as we're talking,
Leo realizes

15:01.335 --> 15:03.424
where he's seen
this guy before.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.686
Where had he
seen him?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.557
SHEILA: In Glendale.
Right down the street

15:06.601 --> 15:08.864
from Cyther-Tech,
which is where the guy works.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.432
WOMAN: And what did Leo say
this guy was doing?

15:11.475 --> 15:13.695
SHEILA: Leo said he saw
him in the parking lot

15:13.738 --> 15:17.351
of some diner.
Rob was kissing a waitress.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.918
WOMAN:
Are you gonna tell the wife?

15:18.961 --> 15:20.702
SHEILA: Well,
I just met the woman.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.574
How am I gonna let her know that
her husband is having an affair?

15:27.361 --> 15:29.276
Beth Ann.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.278
Beth Ann!

15:31.321 --> 15:33.758
Beth Ann!

15:35.760 --> 15:38.328
Tommy, can you ask Gustav
if he's ready

15:38.372 --> 15:39.634
to serve
the desserts?

15:39.677 --> 15:40.765
Sure thing,
Mrs. Grove.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.812
Oh, what's this?

15:43.855 --> 15:47.381
I don't know.
It was here when I came in.

15:57.521 --> 16:00.742
TOMMY: Gustav said
desserts are good to go.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.962
Oh, thank you.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.615
Mrs. Grove?

16:04.659 --> 16:06.835
Is, uh,
is everything okay?

16:06.878 --> 16:10.970
Everything's fine.
Absolutely fine.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.639
I'm happy.

16:33.601 --> 16:36.560
♪ Cigarettes hanging
from her lips ♪

16:36.604 --> 16:38.562
♪ And between your teeth...

16:38.606 --> 16:40.434
Hey.
Hey.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.784
What happened?Her ex was definitely
in the car.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.003
We had to call the cops.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.569
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.701
Did they arrest him?

16:46.744 --> 16:48.659
Duke-- that's his name...

16:48.703 --> 16:49.878
Great name.He drove away

16:49.921 --> 16:52.011
before they got there.Whoa.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.056
Well, she shouldn't go back to
the condo until they find him.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.885
Right. That's what
I told her.Good.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.800
So did you take her to a hotel?

17:00.845 --> 17:02.586
Um...

17:02.630 --> 17:04.849
What?
Don't be mad...

17:04.893 --> 17:06.938
About what?

17:06.982 --> 17:08.331
Jade's outside.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.986
No!

17:11.030 --> 17:13.336
She didn't want to be alone.I don't care.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.337
Eli.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.686
Rule number one:

17:15.730 --> 17:17.340
We don't bring our hookups
into the house.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.515
But I'm worried about her.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.082
Which means you've violated

17:20.126 --> 17:21.866
rule number two. You've become
emotionally involved.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.390
That is an insult to me

17:23.433 --> 17:25.522
and the sacred institution
known as open marriage.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.701
Damn it, Taylor,
this is a really big favor.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.486
I know, baby.

17:32.529 --> 17:33.878
All right, fine, one night.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.098
I told her she could
stay the weekend.Two nights.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.709
Monday is Labor Day,
so technically...Three nights.

17:38.753 --> 17:39.884
Final offer.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.364
Thank you.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.585
Okay, um, should we
pick up a little bit?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.935
No. I want
the Pasadena

17:46.978 --> 17:49.111
bisexual community
to see how you live.

17:49.155 --> 17:53.376
Oh, Lord.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.900
Come on in, Jade.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.728
Hey.
Hey, this is Eli.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.078
Hey.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.862
Thank you so much

18:00.905 --> 18:03.082
for letting me stay.
I really, really appreciate it.

18:04.953 --> 18:07.564
We're gonna put Jade in
the guest room. Will you grab

18:07.608 --> 18:09.610
her suitcase, honey?

18:11.438 --> 18:13.396
Eli?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.746
Huh?

18:15.790 --> 18:18.009
Oh, yeah,
absolutely.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.750
Oh!
Oh, my gosh!

18:19.794 --> 18:21.404
Are you okay?Nothing's broken.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.537
It's all good. Right up here.
Right this way.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.595
Beth Ann?
Sheila.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.858
Now is not a good time.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.296
I'll be quick. I must apologize.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.775
Please.

18:44.819 --> 18:47.343
I have to get my housework done
before Rob gets home.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.650
I just feel awful
about what you heard.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.521
You have every right to hate me.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.175
I don't hate you.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.612
Just know that I won't be
sharing that story

18:55.656 --> 18:56.831
with anyone else.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.660
Good, because it's not true.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.966
Beth Ann...

19:02.010 --> 19:05.274
It's not. Leo is mistaken.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.844
He knows what he saw.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.846
Rob kissed
a blonde waitress

19:11.889 --> 19:14.762
in the parking lot
of Jansen's Diner.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.681
It's impossible.

19:20.724 --> 19:24.641
Maybe you should talk to him.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.257
He couldn't.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.957
He wouldn't put me through that.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.307
He's a man.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.004
Some of them cheat.

19:40.048 --> 19:43.747
Not Rob, not Rob.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.405
Not after what happened
to our daughter.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.933
You had a daughter?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.808
Oh, honey.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.603
So, please,
tell Leo he's wrong.

20:15.431 --> 20:19.348
Rob and I are so very happy.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.467
Oh, shit.SIMONE: It's fine, Myron.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.469
You know what they say:
It's not a party

20:53.513 --> 20:55.993
until someone breaks something,
and that was expensive,

20:56.037 --> 20:58.909
so we must be having
a marvelous time.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.825
Darling, one of the waiters
said you were looking for me?

21:01.869 --> 21:04.001
I need to speak to you.
Privately.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.960
Of course.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.312
You want to talk in here?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.835
It'll just be
a moment.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.881
All right,
what's-what's going on?

21:23.934 --> 21:27.024
Uh...

21:27.068 --> 21:28.896
Where did you
get this?

21:28.939 --> 21:32.769
Does it matter? Who is he?

21:35.511 --> 21:37.121
Darling, if I could just...

21:37.165 --> 21:38.949
Tell me his name.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.563
Winston.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.478
What's his last name?

21:47.523 --> 21:49.395
I-I don't know.

21:53.181 --> 21:56.097
Is he the only one
or have there been others?

22:01.015 --> 22:02.582
Here's what's going to happen.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.671
You will go upstairs
to begin packing.

22:04.714 --> 22:08.370
I will tell our guests that
you have some sort of headache.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.590
You won't come down
until everyone's gone.

22:10.633 --> 22:14.115
It's crucial they know
nothing of this.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.117
Do you understand?
I will not be humiliated.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.554
I'm s...Don't!

22:18.598 --> 22:19.729
I'm so sorry.

22:19.773 --> 22:23.472
You cannot apologize for this.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.784
JADE :
I just don't think I'll be
able to find a new place

22:30.827 --> 22:32.960
in the next few days.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.701
I know. I told Eli.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.408
Are we gonna pretend
I didn't just catch you spying?

22:46.452 --> 22:48.584
That would be the polite thing
to do, yeah.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.934
Okay.

22:50.978 --> 22:54.677
Everything okay
with Jade?
Mm-hmm.

22:54.721 --> 22:58.464
She was asking if she
could stay till Friday.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.944
Taylor!I told her, "Not cool."

23:00.988 --> 23:02.163
She backed off.

23:02.206 --> 23:05.122
All right. Thank you.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.995
She does seem like
a nice kid.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.518
Yeah, Jade's very nice.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.870
She's pretty, too.
Don't you think?

23:13.914 --> 23:16.090
Yeah. Yeah, she's okay.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.092
We don't lie to
each other, remember?

23:18.135 --> 23:20.137
Okay, fine.
She's spectacular.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.138
Mm.You happy?

23:21.182 --> 23:22.139
I am.
Yeah.

23:22.183 --> 23:25.795
Oh...

23:25.839 --> 23:27.188
Mm...
Come here.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.756
Mm.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.587
I got so lucky
with you.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.460
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

23:38.504 --> 23:42.159
Most guys would not be down
with this kind of lifestyle.

23:42.203 --> 23:43.160
Well... you know...

23:43.204 --> 23:46.163
I get to have
my fun, too. So.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.819
But you only agreed
to this arrangement

23:49.863 --> 23:52.605
because you knew
how much it meant to me.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.303
So for that,
I thank you.

24:03.659 --> 24:07.010
Mm... are we gonna
have sex now?

24:07.707 --> 24:09.186
Mm-hmm.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.798
Are you gonna be thinking about
Jade while we're doing it?

24:11.841 --> 24:12.973
Probably.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.670
Me, too.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.026
Hello?

24:23.070 --> 24:25.202
Honey, I hope you haven't
started dinner yet.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.726
I got to meet a client
out for a drink.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.555
A client?

24:29.598 --> 24:32.732
It might go late, so...
don't wait up.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.517
Oh, I'll make you a sandwich.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.127
It will be in the fridge
when you get home.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.826
Sounds great.
Love you.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.159
Is everybody gone?

25:52.202 --> 25:53.726
Your mother
was the last to leave.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.162
She said she'll see you at home.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.859
I, uh, finished
cleaning the kitchen,

25:56.903 --> 25:57.860
and everything's put away.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.122
Thank you.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.907
Be sure to lock up
before you leave.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.300
Is Mr. Grove okay?

26:05.868 --> 26:09.002
I mean, he never came
back down to the party.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.179
Don't you worry
about him.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.147
Why aren't you
finished packing?

26:24.191 --> 26:26.193
I'm only seeing casual clothes.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.803
You'll need at least
two suits.

26:27.847 --> 26:30.937
By the way, I don't want anyone
at the art gallery

26:30.980 --> 26:33.200
knowing about this.
Not until the divorce is final.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.724
Did you say something?

26:35.768 --> 26:37.378
I'm packing your Armani.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.815
You'll need something black.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.295
Once we've gone public,

26:41.338 --> 26:43.166
you need to tell our friends
at the country club

26:43.210 --> 26:44.690
that this was amicable.

26:44.733 --> 26:47.431
I want to avoid as many
condescending looks as possible.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.346
Why are you mumbling?

26:49.390 --> 26:52.175
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

26:55.091 --> 26:58.181
Why are you sweating?

26:58.225 --> 26:59.356
Karl?

27:04.405 --> 27:06.189
What did you do?!

27:06.233 --> 27:07.669
You think you're gonna

27:07.713 --> 27:09.018
get out of this by dying?
Fuck you!

27:09.062 --> 27:10.541
I want to see you

27:10.585 --> 27:13.022
suffer in a one-bedroom
apartment next to the airport,

27:13.066 --> 27:15.024
and you will not
deny me that pleasure!

27:16.069 --> 27:19.463
Hello?
Yes.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.987
Uh, we've had a little incident.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.903
Can you send an ambulance
to 4352 Seneca?

27:23.946 --> 27:25.731
Yes, it's my husband.
He seems to have taken

27:25.774 --> 27:27.080
a few too many pills.

27:27.123 --> 27:30.126
Uh, could you hold?

27:30.170 --> 27:31.258
Wake up!

27:32.868 --> 27:34.348
Excuse me, I'm back.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.176
Oh, it's on its way?

27:36.219 --> 27:37.960
Oh, thank you so much.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.310
My husband and I
will be waiting.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.277
Karl.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.936
Karl...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.469
Something is weird.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.558
Our home is clean.

28:10.601 --> 28:14.605
Yeah.
Isn't that weird?

28:14.649 --> 28:15.868
JADE:
Hey!

28:15.911 --> 28:17.870
I was just coming up
to wake you guys.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.349
Did you clean
our house?

28:19.393 --> 28:21.569
It was my way
of saying thank you.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.920
Also, I ran to the store
and I got stuff for breakfast.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.925
Go ahead, sit down.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.536
The orange juice
is freshly squeezed,

28:32.580 --> 28:34.451
and I'm making pancakes.TAYLOR: Honey, you didn't
have to do all this.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.323
Oh, I wanted to.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.673
Cooking relaxes me.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.022
Yeah, let her relax.

28:40.066 --> 28:43.112
Sit down.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.942
Wait a minute, where
did these plates come from?

28:46.986 --> 28:49.118
It's our good china.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.381
So lovely.
Yeah.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.340
Why don't we
ever use it?

28:53.383 --> 28:55.081
I don't know
where we keep it.

28:56.517 --> 28:59.694
Jade.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.263
She cooks, she cleans,
she juices...

29:03.306 --> 29:05.918
She's the wife we always wanted. Yeah.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.268
Mm-hmm.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.574
Do you ever wish
I were more like this?

29:10.618 --> 29:12.228
Cooking your breakfast

29:12.272 --> 29:14.230
and pouring your coffee?

29:14.274 --> 29:15.536
I married a kick-ass lawyer.

29:15.579 --> 29:16.929
That's better than having
my coffee poured.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.931
Good answer.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.933
How about you?
Do you ever

29:20.976 --> 29:23.631
resent me for not
bringing home more money?

29:23.674 --> 29:26.155
It's been a while
since I sold a script.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.505
You're trying.

29:28.549 --> 29:32.248
But the last two years,
you've been the breadwinner.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.338
That never bothers you?

29:39.516 --> 29:40.691
Here we go.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.957
Do you like bacon?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.523
Uh...

29:46.567 --> 29:50.527
well, I'm Jewish,
so, yeah.

29:57.578 --> 30:00.711
The meat loaf's delicious.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.496
Did you change the recipe?

30:03.540 --> 30:06.674
Little bit.Well, good job.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.284
Better than ever.

30:11.026 --> 30:14.029
Penny for your thoughts.

30:14.073 --> 30:18.425
Oh, I was just...
thinking about...

30:18.468 --> 30:21.080
silly things.What kind of

30:21.123 --> 30:22.559
silly things?

30:24.605 --> 30:26.563
I was wondering when you'll die.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.307
Excuse me?

30:31.351 --> 30:35.529
Oh-- Whether it will be sooner
rather than later.

30:35.572 --> 30:38.401
I'm not dying anytime soon.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.142
You don't know that.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.102
You could be hit by a bus.

30:43.145 --> 30:47.280
Or have a stroke, or get...
stabbed in the chest.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.196
Beth Ann.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.415
Myra Penn's husband was 50

30:52.459 --> 30:54.809
when he choked to death
on a pimento.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.812
I'm only 42, and I feel great.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.771
Can we just eat dinner?

31:05.167 --> 31:07.387
I put pimentos in the meat loaf.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.565
That's how I changed the recipe.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.699
Are you angry with me?

31:15.743 --> 31:18.441
Why would you say that?You're fantasizing

31:18.485 --> 31:20.574
about my death, for starters.Oh, I don't

31:20.617 --> 31:22.141
wishyou dead.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.839
I'm just wondering
what will become of me

31:24.883 --> 31:26.754
when the inevitable happens.

31:26.797 --> 31:29.626
Inevitable?

31:29.670 --> 31:31.150
I don't have a job.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.065
Or a hobby.

31:33.108 --> 31:36.503
All I do is take care of you.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.766
That's what makes you
a good wife.

31:38.809 --> 31:42.074
But when you're not
here anymore,

31:42.117 --> 31:45.512
who will I be?

31:47.557 --> 31:51.083
My widow?

31:51.126 --> 31:53.128
Listen to what I'm saying.

31:55.652 --> 31:58.264
I need something more.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.135
Like what?

32:00.179 --> 32:02.921
I don't know, exactly.

32:04.139 --> 32:07.099
This something more...

32:07.142 --> 32:11.625
will it keep you from making me
delicious dinners?

32:11.668 --> 32:14.497
No.
Then you have
my permission

32:14.541 --> 32:17.848
to do whatever makes you happy.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.202
But just so you know...

32:23.245 --> 32:27.858
I intend on sticking around
for a while.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.343
Okay.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.317
What is it?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.362
Pimento.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.452
Sorry.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.768
PARAMEDIC:
Ma'am, do you want to ride
with us to the hospital?

33:07.811 --> 33:10.466
Yes.
But give me a moment.

33:10.510 --> 33:11.685
Margaret.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.382
Simone, what happened?

33:13.426 --> 33:14.601
Oh, it was the silliest thing.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.472
Karl slipped coming down
the stairs.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.170
Oh...Nothing to worry about.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.388
He just hit his head.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.217
Oh, Harold.
I love the robe.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.871
Uh, so Karl's okay?

33:23.914 --> 33:25.873
He's fine.
Go on home.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.571
Don't mind us.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.401
PARAMEDIC:
We're almost ready
to go, ma'am.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.230
Uh... just be a moment.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.191
Wanda.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.410
What are you doing here?

33:41.454 --> 33:42.890
I heard the sirens.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.457
What's going on?

33:44.500 --> 33:45.936
Uh, nothing.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.764
Karl just had a little fall
coming down the stairs.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.854
You sure you didn't push him?

33:52.769 --> 33:55.598
I wouldn't blame you.
Considering.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.690
Youleft that photo.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.348
PARAMEDIC:
Oh, my God!

34:06.392 --> 34:07.828
Hey! Hey!

34:07.871 --> 34:10.657
Stop! Hey. Stop.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.443
SIMONE:
Bitch!

34:14.487 --> 34:15.749
Oh!

34:15.792 --> 34:18.230
Have you lost your mind?Of course not.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.536
I'm drunk.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.239
Hey.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.762
I brought wine.

34:28.805 --> 34:31.504
Sheila, you didn't
need to do that.

34:31.547 --> 34:32.940
Well, I wanted to see
how you were doing

34:32.983 --> 34:35.421
and I couldn't come
empty-handed.

34:36.987 --> 34:40.600
I went to that diner, and...

34:40.643 --> 34:43.429
I saw Rob kiss the waitress.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.431
Oh, honey.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.998
You sit and I'll pour.

34:52.002 --> 34:54.962
I've decided
not to say anything.

34:55.005 --> 34:58.705
If I put Rob on the defensive,
it will affect our marriage.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.577
He's committing adultery.

35:01.621 --> 35:04.276
That's supposed
to affect your marriage.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.713
I'm just going to work harder
at being a good wife.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.976
To remind Rob

35:09.019 --> 35:10.847
why he loves me.

35:10.891 --> 35:13.981
And then, hopefully...

35:14.982 --> 35:17.071
There is another option.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.464
What's that?

35:18.507 --> 35:19.726
Confront the girl.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.554
The girl?

35:21.597 --> 35:23.730
Go to her diner
and make a scene.

35:23.773 --> 35:26.602
Sheila. She might not even
know that Rob is married.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.126
Oh, those tramps always know.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.476
Threaten to tell her boss
unless she stops seeing Rob.

35:30.519 --> 35:32.869
Scare her to death.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.830
I suppose that could work.

35:38.962 --> 35:42.314
But I just don't know
where I would find the courage.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.315
It's right here,

35:43.358 --> 35:46.579
at the bottom
of this glass.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.634
This is your wife's lover?

35:58.678 --> 36:00.332
Yeah.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.334
Damn.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.857
Ooh, she got game.Mm-hmm.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.077
Oh, and get this: Jade?

36:07.121 --> 36:08.601
Total neat freak.

36:08.644 --> 36:09.950
Spent the
last two days

36:09.993 --> 36:11.865
compulsively cleaning
our entire house.

36:11.908 --> 36:14.868
And she cooks
and she does laundry.

36:14.911 --> 36:18.088
She sewed this button
on my shirt this morning.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.352
So she's into some
serious housewife shit.

36:20.395 --> 36:21.875
Oh, man, I got
to tell you,

36:21.918 --> 36:23.398
it's addictive.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.748
Like, having a woman
wait on me like this?

36:25.792 --> 36:27.924
Bringing out my inner caveman.

36:27.968 --> 36:32.755
So, um, what else is Jade into?

36:32.799 --> 36:34.366
What do you mean?Well, you know me.

36:34.409 --> 36:36.542
I hear about a sexy lady
who lives to serve,

36:36.585 --> 36:39.414
my imagination
runs wild.No, no, no, no. No.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.416
She's my wife's lover,
not mine.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.419
Well, I would now like to say
the two most beautiful words

36:44.463 --> 36:46.160
in the English language:

36:46.204 --> 36:47.727
three-way.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.076
Technically, that's one word.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.078
Don't hit me
with that hyphen bullshit.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.949
I'm trying
to get you laid, bitch.: All right.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.038
Taylor and I,
we've never done that before.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.780
You don't need to train for it.

36:57.824 --> 37:01.088
It's sex, not ice dancing.

37:01.131 --> 37:04.047
You already got an open
marriage. What's the big deal?

37:04.091 --> 37:07.529
Well, to begin with, I don't
know that Jade's that into me.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.531
She sewed a button on for you.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.881
That's how white girls
say "Fuck me."

37:11.925 --> 37:13.579
You're crazy.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.146
Look, I know what I know.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.043
Hi. I'm April.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.959
I'll be your waitress
this morning.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.746
Um, can I get you
some coffee to start?

37:54.837 --> 37:56.535
Ma'am?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.240
Are you okay?

38:10.026 --> 38:11.506
I'm sorry.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.552
Here.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.994
I don't know
what is wrong with me.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.996
We all have bad days.

38:23.039 --> 38:25.738
I know I have.

38:25.781 --> 38:30.133
You seem like a very nice girl.

38:30.177 --> 38:32.048
I try to be.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.578
You know, I'm not really
that hungry. I should go.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.580
Oh, at least let me
get you a cup of coffee.

38:41.623 --> 38:42.929
It's all right.

38:44.234 --> 38:45.845
Ma'am?

38:45.888 --> 38:48.761
Um...

38:48.804 --> 38:50.502
You look like you could use
someone to talk to.

38:50.545 --> 38:51.851
And we're slow
right now.

38:51.894 --> 38:54.027
I could sit with you for a bit.No.

38:54.070 --> 38:55.550
You don't have to do that.

38:55.594 --> 38:58.031
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.
You can tell me about your life,

38:58.074 --> 39:01.295
I'll tell you about mine,
and then, we'll be friends.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.255
Now, wouldn't you like that?

39:10.565 --> 39:15.744
I suppose I could stay
a few minutes.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.093
Sure.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.095
I am so glad.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.097
Come on.

39:23.578 --> 39:25.885
Um, sorry.

39:25.928 --> 39:28.627
Uh, what was your name?

39:31.630 --> 39:32.979
Sheila.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.939
My name is Sheila.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.171
Door's open.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.916
Hey, Mrs. Grove.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.005
What's all this?

39:59.048 --> 40:02.617
These are a few
of my favorite things.

40:02.661 --> 40:04.489
Well, my mom told
me that Mr. Grove

40:04.532 --> 40:06.491
went to the hospital last night.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.841
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

40:08.884 --> 40:12.584
He'll be there a few days,
but he'll recover.

40:12.627 --> 40:14.629
Anything else?

40:14.673 --> 40:16.979
Um...

40:17.023 --> 40:21.636
Yeah, actually, um,
I wanted to apologize.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.856
For what?

40:23.899 --> 40:25.945
I lied to you last night.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.294
I saw the photo

40:27.337 --> 40:28.948
of your husband

40:28.991 --> 40:31.603
and his... friend.

40:31.646 --> 40:34.214
I-I didn't know what to
do, so I put the photo

40:34.257 --> 40:35.824
back in the envelope.

40:35.868 --> 40:38.958
Well, did you tell
your mother about this?No.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.350
No.

40:42.352 --> 40:44.920
She'll find out eventually,
I just can't handle that.

40:44.964 --> 40:47.532
Not just yet.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.925
So is Mr. Grove gay?

40:50.926 --> 40:54.234
Oh, yeah.

40:57.672 --> 41:00.022
I am so sorry.

41:05.593 --> 41:08.553
It's funny, my first husband
liked booze more than me.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.250
My second liked cocaine
more than me.

41:10.293 --> 41:13.079
My third likes boys
more than me.

41:13.122 --> 41:16.212
Am I the only one here
seeing a pattern?

41:20.608 --> 41:24.046
Maybe you just haven't met
the right man yet.

41:24.090 --> 41:29.182
I've always thought of myself
as this fabulous woman.

41:29.225 --> 41:34.230
But how fabulous can I be
if nobody wants to love me?

41:36.668 --> 41:38.626
Hey...

41:44.327 --> 41:46.025
Come here.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.395
Tommy.

42:08.438 --> 42:11.180
I've wanted to do
that since I was 13.

42:11.224 --> 42:12.834
Well, how old are you now?

42:12.878 --> 42:16.185
I'm 18.

42:16.229 --> 42:18.187
In two days.

42:18.231 --> 42:20.320
As much as it would cheer me up

42:20.363 --> 42:22.627
to commit a felony,
I think you should go.

42:26.718 --> 42:28.720
Okay.

42:35.291 --> 42:38.120
Just remember,

42:38.164 --> 42:41.776
there's at least one man in this
world who's dying to fuck you.

43:04.756 --> 43:07.019
Hey. Are you working
on something?Hey.

43:07.062 --> 43:10.196
'Cause I wanted to go swim,
but if it would bother you...

43:10.239 --> 43:11.850
No, no, no. No, no.
No, you swim.

43:11.893 --> 43:14.983
I will just be here
only looking at my computer.

43:15.027 --> 43:16.419
Okay.

43:23.731 --> 43:27.909
So, I found out that you and I
have the same taste in movies.

43:27.953 --> 43:29.694
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

43:29.737 --> 43:31.391
Um, that poster,
framed on the wall?

43:31.434 --> 43:33.219
Jenny From Yesterday?

43:33.262 --> 43:34.394
I love that movie.

43:34.437 --> 43:36.701
You do?
Yeah.

43:36.744 --> 43:38.877
I saw it four times.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.792
It made me cry.

43:40.835 --> 43:42.794
I guess you love it, too?

43:42.837 --> 43:45.405
Uh, well, yeah,
I'm, I'm-I'm partial,

43:45.448 --> 43:47.102
but mostly
just 'cause I wrote it.

43:48.364 --> 43:50.323
No!

43:50.366 --> 43:52.717
Yeah, yeah. I'm Eli Cohen.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.894
My name's right there
in the credits.

43:55.937 --> 43:58.287
I never pay attention
to who writes the movie.

43:58.331 --> 44:01.116
You'll do well in Hollywood.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.466
God, this is crazy.
I can't believe this.

44:03.510 --> 44:05.991
I'm staying with the guy
who wrote my favorite movie.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.427
It's not your favorite movie.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.255
It totally is.No...

44:09.298 --> 44:11.083
And I'm not the only person
who feels that way.

44:11.126 --> 44:13.999
There's, like, a ton of people
worship that movie.

44:14.042 --> 44:17.437
You must be
so proud of yourself.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.134
Please, please stop. Okay?

44:19.178 --> 44:21.876
You're embarrassing me.No.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.748
I think it's incredible.

44:23.791 --> 44:27.012
Get used to it.
You're really, really special.

44:46.292 --> 44:47.772
Hey.

44:47.815 --> 44:49.512
Hey.

44:49.556 --> 44:52.167
I was in court today
for seven hours straight.

44:52.211 --> 44:53.865
It was a shit-show.

44:53.908 --> 44:56.824
Woof. Well, you know what?

44:56.868 --> 44:58.260
We'll have some wine
with dinner tonight.

44:58.304 --> 44:59.435
You'll relax.

44:59.479 --> 45:00.915
Sounds wonderful.

45:00.959 --> 45:03.135
So I was thinking,

45:03.178 --> 45:05.485
if Jade needed to stay here

45:05.528 --> 45:07.922
a couple extra weeks,

45:07.966 --> 45:09.141
it's no problem.

45:09.184 --> 45:11.796
Honey, you would do that for me?

45:11.839 --> 45:16.017
Hey, you know me.
I'm all about being a nice guy.

45:24.852 --> 45:27.028
It's a simple question, really.

45:27.072 --> 45:29.117
Why would a woman kill?

45:29.161 --> 45:30.989
And who would she murder?

45:31.032 --> 45:32.817
The man who did her wrong?

45:32.860 --> 45:34.253
The other woman?

45:34.296 --> 45:37.299
Perhaps a friend
guilty of betrayal?

45:37.343 --> 45:40.346
To know the answer, you must
listen to the woman's story.

45:40.389 --> 45:42.391
Discover her secrets.

45:42.435 --> 45:45.525
Only then can you understand
the choices she made.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.005
You might condemn her.

45:47.048 --> 45:48.528
You might forgive her.

45:48.571 --> 45:51.574
You might think you'd have done
the exact same thing.

45:51.618 --> 45:53.925
But for the woman who kills,

45:53.968 --> 45:55.970
only one question
really matters.

45:56.014 --> 45:57.972
Does she get away with it?
