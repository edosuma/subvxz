WEBVTT

00:20.478 --> 00:21.479
[Seth] Trice.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.734
You got to pull it together.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.111
Are you gonna help me, yes or no?

00:28.194 --> 00:31.114
I ain't gonna get you no gun. No. Hell no!

00:31.197 --> 00:32.991
Don't take a righteous tone with me.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.036
How am I supposed to live with this?

00:36.494 --> 00:39.164
Knowing that he's out there,
living his life,

00:39.247 --> 00:41.291
loving on his child.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.542
What about mine?

00:43.626 --> 00:47.213
Taking this out on the street, Tricey,
that ain't you. It's not you.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.675
What do you know what's me
and what's not me? Huh?

00:51.009 --> 00:52.927
You don't even have a child!

00:53.011 --> 00:57.766
Until you got a child that's laid out
in front of you, you don't know anything.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.979
I don't know how to help you anymore,
Tricey.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.274
I don't know.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.942
I'll find another way.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.281
I'll do what I gotta do!

01:13.364 --> 01:15.366
[breath trembling]

01:31.800 --> 01:32.634
[gasps]

01:41.309 --> 01:43.269
-What are you doing here?
-What did Petey do?

01:43.353 --> 01:44.187
What?

01:44.270 --> 01:46.272
Manny and Osorio were whispering
about some witness,

01:46.356 --> 01:48.858
about turning Petey in.
What the fuck did he do?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.320
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.782
I didn't tell you, but when I moved
my stuff out of Wally's house,

01:55.865 --> 01:57.951
he-- he went fucking crazy on me.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.995
And these cops came by my house,
asking about his car.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.914
His blue SUV. Why?

02:03.706 --> 02:04.791
What's going on?

02:06.459 --> 02:08.753
Marie. Look at me!

02:08.837 --> 02:12.382
You're always complaining about him,
and I'm sick of it.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.928
That kid in the park...

02:19.347 --> 02:20.723
it was Pete who killed him?

02:20.807 --> 02:23.226
Don't-- Don't use that word in my house.

02:25.061 --> 02:28.481
And don't look at me like that.
You know my husband's a good man.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.278
How could he do that to a kid?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.072
He was just a kid.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.657
You always hated him.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.993
You never leave him alone.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.163
You're just jealous,
'cause you don't have anyone.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.752
There's something wrong with Pete.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.714
Like in his heart.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.800
When are you gonna see that?

02:56.301 --> 02:57.594
[door opens]

03:00.555 --> 03:01.389
[door closes]

03:11.566 --> 03:13.443
[line ringing]

03:15.904 --> 03:17.697
[man] We want justice!

03:17.780 --> 03:19.490
[protestors yelling indistinctly]

03:22.035 --> 03:25.121
[man 2] When are we gonna find out
the truth about Brenton Butler?

03:25.204 --> 03:26.706
[man 3] Who killed Brenton?

03:26.789 --> 03:28.917
You, motherfucker? You?

03:30.501 --> 03:32.712
[protestors continue yelling indistinctly]

03:40.720 --> 03:43.556
You rat out another cop,
you're gonna be waiting on a bullet,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.600
looking over your shoulder
the rest of your days.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.977
-That's a bad fucking play.
-That a threat?

03:48.353 --> 03:49.812
That's common sense.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.816
The witness, the one you said
you took care of? I seen her.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.735
She's in police custody.
Save your fucking breath.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.112
-You seen her, you did nothing?
-Yeah, I don't kill kids.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.239
Neither do I.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.824
Would you fucking look at this shit, man?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.577
It ain't fucking going anywhere.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.747
We had nothing to do with it.
That's on you and Jablonski.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.708
Yeah, you think you know what this shit
looks like moving forward?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.752
Can't even keep your fucking bird
from chirping.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.629
-Fuck you talking about?
-Fucking Teresa.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.589
-You said she was asleep.
-She fucking knows.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.133
Her cousin Marie called me.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.468
So you listen to me.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.804
Ratting out Jablonski won't do shit.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.223
And once you rat...

04:26.015 --> 04:28.101
all that money you got used to having...

04:28.893 --> 04:32.480
Jasmine got used to spending
on herself and Pearl, that's fucking gone.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.025
See how long your baby mamas
stick around for this shit pay.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.695
-Get yourself a job mowing lawns.
-Ain't no other way, man.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.821
Yeah, there's a way.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.741
Jablonski disappears,
we're all in the clear.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.744
Now you're talking about offing a cop?
You fucking crazy?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.538
Like you did that fucking witness, right?

04:49.455 --> 04:52.125
He's gonna go far, far, away,

04:52.208 --> 04:54.711
out of the city,
out of this fucking state, gone,

04:54.794 --> 04:56.879
and all this shit is gone.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.339
And us...

05:00.550 --> 05:02.302
we go back to what it was.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.179
Just us.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.556
Just like before.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.726
[man] You're liars!
You're all just a bunch of liars!

05:10.685 --> 05:13.980
We get a bigger cut of Messiah's kickback.
Three points to each of us to your two.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.149
No more talking, no negotiating.
That's the deal.

05:17.191 --> 05:20.320
You got 24 hours to get him out of here.
After that, we go to the captain.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.488
[man 2] Don't hide behind those badges!

05:23.865 --> 05:26.242
[protestors] No justice, no peace!

05:26.326 --> 05:28.369
No justice, no peace!

05:28.453 --> 05:30.163
What about the fucking witness?

05:37.795 --> 05:38.713
[Fish sniffles]

05:40.173 --> 05:42.341
I just want to know why do you do it.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.639
Because it's the best fucking feeling
I've ever had.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.937
You're gonna OD one of these days.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.024
You know that's a possibility, right?

05:59.067 --> 06:01.402
I don't shoot, I smoke.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.656
Cigarettes will kill you faster
than smoking a little junk.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.165
Where are you going?

06:14.248 --> 06:16.876
Stay or go, it's up to you,
but I'm-- I'm done.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.628
Look, Fish...

06:20.171 --> 06:21.130
[door closes]

06:27.720 --> 06:28.638
Hey.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.723
How'd it go?

06:32.809 --> 06:34.060
Shit, what?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.687
-What?
-Osorio no-showed.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.314
-Come on.
-Like you.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.025
Where were you?

06:41.651 --> 06:44.153
I called and I texted
and I went to your house.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.531
The kid-- The kid, she became demonic.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.783
She smashed my phone, she went nuts.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.952
I couldn't-- I couldn't control her.
I had to stay.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.078
Come on.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.831
Where are you going?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.333
We are gonna go and we're gonna find him.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.418
And we're gonna get a confession together.
Come on.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.922
-I'm driving. Slow it down.
-Okay.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.591
If the crowd continues to grow,

07:06.175 --> 07:09.595
we will be administering
de-escalation tactics.

07:10.221 --> 07:15.017
So, for the next 48 hours,
I'm gonna need all hands on deck.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.272
You'll be getting your rotation schedule
shortly if you haven't already.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.940
Our aim:

07:22.066 --> 07:23.985
calming the subjects

07:24.068 --> 07:28.614
and working towards the safety
of officers and the community.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.908
What the hell happened?

07:32.410 --> 07:35.288
I did a gut check.
It don't feel right. Whatever.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.875
Maybe not now, but look, you had
the right idea. Let's go outside and talk.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.710
Look, I get the feeling you're a good guy,

07:40.793 --> 07:43.421
but in this district,
you're considered a fucking cancer, so...

07:44.213 --> 07:45.298
So you're scared?

07:47.091 --> 07:49.802
Oh, cool. Thanks.
Yeah, that was a good talk.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.305
Yo, that's my man Osorio right there.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.223
Fucking prick.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.228
[protestors yelling indistinctly]

08:09.572 --> 08:12.783
[man] Yeah, you! Yeah! Dirty cop!

08:21.501 --> 08:27.715
[crowd chanting]
Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice!

08:27.798 --> 08:28.674
[engine starts]

08:28.758 --> 08:35.640
Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice!
Justice! Justice! Justice!

08:56.786 --> 08:58.371
[Pete] What are you doing here?

08:58.454 --> 09:00.456
Wilcox and Osorio are gonna turn you in.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.336
You got a 24-hour window
to get out of the city.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.797
[Marie] Teresa heard them talking.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.758
He's right, Petey, we gotta go.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.053
You fucking call him before coming to me?

09:14.136 --> 09:15.888
'Cause you don't do anything!

09:16.514 --> 09:17.682
And I feel like an animal,

09:17.765 --> 09:20.101
trapped in my own house,
never knowing who's gonna show up.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.144
Enough! Enough.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.984
Where are we supposed to go?

09:28.067 --> 09:31.529
Arizona, Mexico, the fucking moon?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.198
We can't just leave.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.700
But we'll be together, babe.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.245
Just you, me, and Mikey.
That's all that matters.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.671
This is to help make it a little easier.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.929
This ain't enough.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.640
You got no idea how much a baby costs.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.350
This isn't gonna last
more than a few months.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.643
Marie, enough.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.145
I'll take care of us.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.524
I'm gonna go pack.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.531
-If I'd just done the right thing--
-This is on me.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.744
Not you. I made the decision.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.787
'Cause in that moment...

10:22.997 --> 10:25.875
all I knew, with certainty,
is that you're a good man.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.880
Above all things, that was clear.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.010
But protecting that is not cut and dry.
It's a fucking minefield.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.470
Lift your fucking head.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.516
Lift your head.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.186
Hey.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.563
You gotta understand,
for both our sakes...

10:49.273 --> 10:50.733
you are still that guy.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.488
But for now, you gotta take
this opportunity...

10:58.866 --> 10:59.742
and go.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.510
I'm sorry.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.605
[door opens]

11:30.940 --> 11:31.774
[door closes]

11:36.570 --> 11:38.322
You should've gotten his confession
last night.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.282
You have no idea what I went through.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.618
-Nadine was there, he might have seen her.
-You fucked up.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.620
That is the bottom line.
And we were close.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.705
-Ongoing investigation, shit happens.
-Fucking bitch!

11:46.789 --> 11:47.623
Hey, hey!

11:47.706 --> 11:49.667
-[KJ] What the fuck?
-You are nothing to him!

11:50.126 --> 11:52.586
-Nothing! You're just his slut! His whore!
-Hey.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.172
I am his wife! Me! Not you!

11:55.256 --> 11:57.967
-Cool it! Get out of here. Walk away.
-Don't you fucking touch me!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.969
-You are nothing to him!
-Hey.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.221
She fucks my husband
and she's the victim?

12:02.304 --> 12:03.305
Fuck you!

12:03.806 --> 12:04.932
Fuck you both.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.399
[KJ sniffles]

12:31.292 --> 12:33.002
Don't just sit there.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.507
Want me to say it's wrong to fuck
other people's spouses? It's wrong.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.301
So fucking what?

12:40.384 --> 12:41.302
Okay.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.387
You think I care?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.432
I'm a bad person.

12:46.974 --> 12:50.102
I fuck other people's husbands,
and I'm a drunk,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.730
and I leave little kids to die.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.691
What?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.235
What are you talking about?

13:02.740 --> 13:03.741
[sniffles]

13:04.408 --> 13:05.409
[whispers] Just...

13:07.953 --> 13:09.455
I could have checked.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.834
I could have called somebody to check.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.378
Check what?
What the fuck are you talking about?

13:18.714 --> 13:21.926
This-- This gang kid I put away.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.385
And he never made bail.

13:23.469 --> 13:28.057
His baby brother and his sister
were in their apartment alone for a week,

13:29.141 --> 13:30.226
locked in.

13:34.605 --> 13:35.814
And the little one...

13:38.901 --> 13:40.653
the baby, he starved to death.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.784
God, I saw those photos.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.579
There were...

13:51.372 --> 13:52.748
scratch marks...

13:53.415 --> 13:56.335
on the door where Tasha, the girl...

13:58.837 --> 14:00.506
had tried to reach the deadbolt.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.010
And...

14:06.804 --> 14:08.305
bite marks on the spaghetti cans

14:08.389 --> 14:11.267
where she had tried to open them
to save her brother.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.693
Everything I do, I cause damage.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.777
Everything.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.583
Is this the part where I cry
because I understand you better?

14:35.666 --> 14:36.834
'Cause I'm not, and I don't.

14:36.917 --> 14:41.130
If being a fuck up helps you justify your
bullshit, don't let me get in your way.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.728
[protestors yelling indistinctly]

14:58.272 --> 15:01.984
[crowd chanting] Justice
for Brenton Butler! Stop killing us!

15:02.067 --> 15:05.571
Justice for Brenton Butler!
Stop killing us!

15:05.654 --> 15:09.158
Justice for Brenton Butler!
Stop killing us!

15:09.241 --> 15:10.117
[cries out]

15:11.660 --> 15:13.162
You okay, hon?

15:13.245 --> 15:14.455
I'm fine.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.707
You're Brenton Butler's mother, ain't you?

15:16.790 --> 15:18.459
[man] We want justice!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.963
[crowd] Justice for Brenton Butler!

15:27.301 --> 15:28.344
[exhales]

15:33.766 --> 15:35.601
Oh, God. Go away.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.520
I'm not talking to reporters
or whoever you are.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.899
I lost my son too.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.038
I know what you're going through.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.710
When they killed my Duane,
I checked out too.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.713
Couldn't eat, work, sleep.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.466
I couldn't even pray no more.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.760
Thinking every day,

16:10.427 --> 16:12.680
every moment of every day,

16:13.180 --> 16:14.807
how he must've cried out for me,

16:15.891 --> 16:18.477
how he must've wondered
where his mama was.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.150
I won't lie.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.154
Duane had his run-ins with the police.

16:30.072 --> 16:34.076
When they encountered him the last time,
he had a gun on him for protection.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.832
They left him to die
out on the street like a dog.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.213
They found Brenton in a ditch.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.552
He was alive and they just...

16:52.219 --> 16:53.512
they just left him.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.598
I don't...

16:56.682 --> 16:59.101
I don't even know what to do anymore.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.895
[sighs]

17:04.898 --> 17:06.442
You gotta forgive.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.696
It was the only way I survived.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.033
By forgiving the man
who took my son from me.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.784
It was the only way.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.497
And then I got to hold up other mothers,
see them through their pain.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.708
-No, no, no, no.
-There's so many of us out there.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.918
You and me, we're not the same.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.004
I need to go,

17:27.546 --> 17:30.674
and I need you to get out of my car,
please.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.551
There's a bereavement group
over on Duncan--

17:32.634 --> 17:34.053
I said please.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.314
[door shuts]

17:56.366 --> 17:57.993
[Osorio] He's gotta have her in there.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.101
[woman on TV]<i> Oh, please!</i>

18:24.603 --> 18:26.772
<i>Oh, darling, I've missed you so.</i>

18:30.025 --> 18:31.068
<i>Meko!</i>

18:34.238 --> 18:35.447
Fuck!

18:35.531 --> 18:36.448
<i>Who?</i>

18:41.161 --> 18:42.871
I need a favor, Allie. Please.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.459
What did you do now?

18:52.506 --> 18:54.049
You're gonna stay here now.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.300
What? Why?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.428
If they find you, they'll kill you.
That's why they followed me to the motel.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.808
But we're like on Long Island.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.685
I offered to take you home.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.186
My parents won't let me testify.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.231
And so we're here,
150 miles out of harm's way.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.151
Now this is what's gonna happen.
No drinking, no drugs, no internet,

19:12.234 --> 19:13.735
no cell phone, no bullshit.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.654
The lady who lives here is a cop.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.866
She knows a con when she sees one.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.951
So unless you want to end up
at child protective services,

19:21.034 --> 19:22.119
you're gonna listen to her.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.038
At night, not gonna leave your room
for any reason, not to take a piss.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.582
During the day, when she's at work,

19:26.665 --> 19:28.876
you're gonna spend your time
volunteering at a local kennel.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.043
What the fuck?

19:30.127 --> 19:33.338
I'll show you how to get to the kennel,
how to get home. But you run on me...

19:34.214 --> 19:35.299
you're on your own.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.388
And now let me introduce you
to my ex-wife. Come on.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.559
Let's go, come on.

19:55.402 --> 20:00.115
Listen. Listen, I want that gun. Seth.
You're gonna get that for me, right?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.492
Fuck, man! I told you
I ain't helping you with that shit!

20:02.576 --> 20:04.786
I'm not gonna be like her,
talking about forgiveness!

20:04.870 --> 20:06.872
I'm not gonna betray my son
with that nonsense.

20:06.955 --> 20:07.956
You're gonna help me.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.208
What the--?

20:09.291 --> 20:13.420
Listen, when he looked at me,
all he saw was just another welfare queen

20:13.503 --> 20:15.839
who surrendered her child to the streets.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.717
He couldn't care less about what he did!

20:20.469 --> 20:24.097
Latrice, once you cross that line,
you're forever on the other side of it.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.434
Well, then you know where to find me.

20:29.561 --> 20:30.896
[dogs barking]

20:35.692 --> 20:38.028
I like dogs, but damn, he fucking reeks.

20:38.111 --> 20:42.032
Hey, don't say that. She can totally
hear you, and she's gorgeous.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.159
Aren't you, Whiskey? Yes, you are.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.120
-You didn't go off premises, did you?
-No.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.332
-Can I come back tomorrow?
-Yeah, but we gotta go, the ex is waiting.

20:50.415 --> 20:54.378
She loses her mind if you're a minute late
to her fucking dried-out pot roast.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.714
Why is she your ex?

20:58.924 --> 21:01.093
-Cause' she is. Come on.
-Does your daughter want a dog?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.844
We're not taking Whiskey with us.
Let's go.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.555
No, listen. She's a good dog, okay?
She's a great dog. She's like--

21:05.639 --> 21:08.225
She's one of those dogs
that'll fight for you harder than anyone

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
and lose their life to save yours,

21:10.102 --> 21:16.066
'cause she knows what it's like
to be sad and scared and alone.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.903
And she'll never give up on you,
even if everyone else does.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.782
I can just tell. Can't you?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.287
I'll think about it, okay?

21:29.079 --> 21:29.913
Okay.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.542
-Let's go. Put her in the hole. Come on.
-Fine, fine.

21:33.625 --> 21:38.088
[kissing] Come on, Whiskey.
Bad man won't let us take you with us.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.216
I'd have had more respect for 'em
if they put a bullet in his head,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.926
but they just left him there.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.679
He didn't have no shoes on.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.683
They just left him there
waiting to die in his socks.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.562
That's my blood they spilt.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.816
And I know who the motherfucker is
that did him.

21:58.775 --> 21:59.735
Five-O.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.906
So I'd like to get what I came for
and be on my way.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.076
Killing a cop? Hell no.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.287
Be a moratorium on business.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.789
Then killing a nigga's okay for business?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.207
I didn't make the rules.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.794
Nah, you just abide by them.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.508
My nigga, if you see a weak man
sitting here in this chair,

22:23.592 --> 22:25.093
your eyes are deceiving you.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.182
You ain't no body snatcher.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.684
Unless war changed you.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.646
Oh, you got that PTSD?

22:36.730 --> 22:40.442
What, you gonna go all John Rambo
and kill the motherfucker

22:40.525 --> 22:42.694
and disappear into the woods
or some shit?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.321
[laughing]

22:52.496 --> 22:54.081
Why you still standing here?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.125
'Cause I can.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.961
Unlike you.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.965
Unlike my nephew that laid in that ditch.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.259
And the nigga that crippled you,

23:07.302 --> 23:08.553
what became of him?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.225
That's the game.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.728
That's how it's played.

23:23.193 --> 23:26.863
Go hit up them corners
before I take that away from you too.

24:32.762 --> 24:35.348
Is it true they left him to die out here?

24:40.437 --> 24:41.855
He didn't die right away.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.984
He was a strong kid.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.154
And he hung on for a while.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.201
I think sometimes the dying do that.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.913
Give us a chance to say goodbye.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.921
You know something.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.382
Teresa...

25:11.927 --> 25:16.181
I know what it's like to want absolution

25:16.723 --> 25:20.101
and to need to be forgiven
for the things we've done.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.356
Please talk to me.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.026
I was driving my cousin to the hospital.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.363
-I told you.
-You're not telling me everything.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.742
I had to 'cause her husband was at work.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.329
He showed up later.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.790
And then...

25:43.375 --> 25:47.254
then I went to work,
after her husband came.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.298
Teresa, please.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.134
I told you already!
You're not listening to me!

26:03.603 --> 26:04.521
[door opens]

26:06.523 --> 26:09.067
Better not be YouTube cat videos.
I hate cats.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.779
Security cam footage from Bayonne hospital

26:12.862 --> 26:14.489
the morning of the hit-and-run.

26:14.614 --> 26:20.203
So... there's Teresa
and her pregnant cousin,

26:20.954 --> 26:25.250
arriving in the parking lot at 6:45 a.m.,
just like she told us.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.420
Another camera caught her
inside the hospital.

26:28.878 --> 26:32.215
Teresa leaves 45 minutes later
at 7:30 a.m.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.384
So maybe from there
she plowed down the kid.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.511
Brenton had to have been hit earlier

26:36.594 --> 26:39.973
because of the degree of frostbite
on his body, and Teresa's car is silver.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.182
So why are we looking at this?

26:41.891 --> 26:44.352
Well, what if the cousin
is the one who hit Brenton?

26:45.979 --> 26:48.607
-What's her name?
-That's what we have to find out.

26:49.232 --> 26:52.902
We need to pull hospital records
and find out what she drives

26:52.986 --> 26:56.197
and look into Teresa's alibi
after she left the hospital.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.907
She said she went to work.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.452
I'm on it, boss.

27:01.202 --> 27:04.164
I'm just asking, what are you gonna
be doing besides ordering me around?

27:06.791 --> 27:09.127
Get to work. Find the cousin.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.714
Hey, listen, if, um...

27:14.966 --> 27:18.636
If you ever need to talk
about that thing...

27:22.098 --> 27:23.433
I know how I reacted.

27:24.476 --> 27:28.396
It's just, kids starving, that's um--

27:28.480 --> 27:29.397
Thanks.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.199
[dog barking in distance]

27:40.575 --> 27:42.577
I've been getting some complaints
from my folks

27:42.660 --> 27:46.039
about your officers being
a little too aggressive on the streets.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.376
You need to honor the same protections
I extend to your people.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.919
What the fuck you talking about?

27:51.002 --> 27:55.215
I put the brakes on a dirt-nap
a disgruntled employee had in the works

27:55.298 --> 27:56.758
for your man Jablonski.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.636
It seems to me
like you did yourself the favor.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.055
Nobody touches police.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.723
Regardless,

28:03.807 --> 28:07.769
as a businessman, it'd be foolish of me
not to seize this opportunity.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.605
I say we let nature take its course.

28:10.688 --> 28:13.066
Let your man Jablonski
get what's coming to him.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.527
Clear the books of all this shit.

28:16.319 --> 28:21.032
Jersey City don't become fucking Ferguson
and we get back to business.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.204
Let's get something straight here,

28:26.287 --> 28:28.623
'cause you got
this whole arrangement confused.

28:28.706 --> 28:31.793
Nobody touches police. Do you hear me?

28:34.254 --> 28:37.382
If it's blue, you and your fucking kind,

28:37.465 --> 28:41.428
you clear the whole fucking sidewalk
the moment you think you see us coming.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.846
We run the shit here!

28:43.555 --> 28:45.390
You just lease out space.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.185
If Jablonski so much
as catches a fucking cold,

28:49.269 --> 28:51.187
I am coming back here,

28:51.271 --> 28:54.232
I'm gonna make sure you join
those other loud-mouthed niggas

28:54.315 --> 28:57.569
at the bottom of the Hudson River
who thought they had something to say.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.863
I hope we understand each other.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.493
-[phone vibrates]
-Get the fuck out of my way.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.288
[rap music playing]

29:09.247 --> 29:11.458
-Hey, what you need?
-[Isaiah] Need to holler at Kadeuce.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.001
-Yo, Kadeuce!
-Tell 'em to back away.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.669
You remember this day?

29:16.045 --> 29:17.213
Now, I made my peace with God,

29:17.297 --> 29:20.175
so whatever happens out on this corner
doesn't matter to me.

29:20.633 --> 29:23.261
I need you to tell me
what you know about my boy.

29:23.344 --> 29:27.432
You didn't want to know about him when
he was here, so I ain't got shit for you.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.684
So whatever you're gonna do,
go ahead and do it.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.436
Otherwise get the fuck off my corner.

29:32.145 --> 29:32.979
No!

29:33.772 --> 29:35.190
This ain't about business.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.901
We don't need that shit out here.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.361
Go feed the streets. Get this money.

29:43.615 --> 29:47.744
If I didn't take time to know him then,
I'll do whatever it takes to know him now.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.371
I wanted to protect him.
I didn't want him to be like everybody--

29:50.455 --> 29:51.372
Like what?

29:51.998 --> 29:52.999
Like me?

29:53.666 --> 29:55.710
I guess nothing about me
has really changed, huh?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.963
Still hand to mouth. Bullshit and roaches
everywhere I lay my head.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.677
I guess I'm everything you thought I'd be,
Mr. Butler.

30:06.554 --> 30:10.892
But the person you saw back then was
your savior tonight. Don't get it twisted.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.436
Your God ain't got shit to do with this.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.772
You can thank Brenton for that.

30:15.855 --> 30:17.732
If you live long enough
to get out of this life,

30:17.816 --> 30:20.985
you'll realize it was God
that touched your heart and used you.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.362
Used me?

30:23.530 --> 30:25.698
Wouldn't make him no different
than any other man in my life.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.908
I never used you.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.576
No.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.497
That would've meant
you actually saw some value in me.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.796
Brenton wasn't built for this.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.968
It was like trying to prevent a lamb
from becoming a lion.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.972
No need, it ain't in his nature.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.016
Is that what he saw in you, a lion?

30:54.644 --> 30:55.687
Then what?

31:21.212 --> 31:22.463
[Pete] You want a beer?

31:25.216 --> 31:28.636
-Yes or no? A simple question.
-What the fuck you still doing here?

31:29.178 --> 31:30.597
I ain't gonna run.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.601
So you're gonna spend
the rest of your life behind bars, huh?

31:35.518 --> 31:38.354
You are making
the biggest fucking mistake of your life.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.523
No, I did that when I listened to you.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.536
Take your money.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.751
I'm gonna be a father.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.839
You know, I had shit for an example,
but that don't mean I gotta repeat it.

32:06.674 --> 32:07.675
I'm not him.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.346
I ain't a coward. I ain't running.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.431
When everything...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.894
Everything's gonna be like it was before.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.822
[Pete sobs quietly]

32:39.457 --> 32:42.210
[whispers] Nothing is ever gonna be
like it was before.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.104
Fuck! Fuck! Motherfuck!

33:01.187 --> 33:03.398
[grunting]

33:23.543 --> 33:25.837
Messiah, it's me.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.842
Jablonski...

33:33.011 --> 33:34.095
let it happen.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.288
-[Latrice] Why are we here?
-[dog whimpers]

34:00.913 --> 34:01.914
Seth.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.208
Seth.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.961
Want to know what it's like
to take a life?

34:07.045 --> 34:07.962
[cocks gun]

34:09.047 --> 34:10.131
Shoot the dog.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.216
No.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.886
You're gonna tell me
you can't shoot no dog

34:14.969 --> 34:17.305
but you're gonna step up on a man
and kill him?

34:18.723 --> 34:19.682
Shoot it.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.897
Two hands, arms strong.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.107
Get up close, ensure the kill,
not just injure it.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.859
You gotta put the gun to its head.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.611
-Shoot it.
-[stammers] Shut up.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.528
Do it now.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.572
-[dog growls]
-If you're gonna kill it, just kill it.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.408
You see what it's like up close?
Think this is easy? Do it.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.910
Do it now, Tricey!

34:39.535 --> 34:40.620
Do it now!

34:40.703 --> 34:42.163
[growling]

34:45.249 --> 34:46.751
[dog panting]

34:48.878 --> 34:50.421
-No!
-[dog yelps]

34:52.381 --> 34:54.008
[dog whining, panting]

35:03.267 --> 35:04.602
[chains rattling]

35:05.770 --> 35:07.105
Go on. Get.

35:08.564 --> 35:09.982
[sirens wailing in distance]

35:24.330 --> 35:25.998
[news anchor speaking indistinctly]

35:26.082 --> 35:29.794
Then what the fuck am I paying you for?
If he's short, that's a problem.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.712
-[knocking on door]
-Look, if you can't hand--

35:33.005 --> 35:33.965
Hold up.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.721
Look, let me call you back.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.645
Boric acid, for the roaches.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.398
The stuff works, but it's best I show you.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.233
How you find me?

35:52.316 --> 35:53.985
You got some customers
that needed ten dollars

35:54.068 --> 35:56.237
more than they wanted
to keep your address to themselves.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.576
I didn't see your value, but my son did.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.162
That means something to me.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.836
You want to spread a dusting.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.548
Most fools make the mistake
of leaving a line.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.676
Nah, roaches walk around that.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.095
You want them to walk through it.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.597
Get it on them.

36:23.055 --> 36:25.933
Then when they lick themselves clean,
they ingest it.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.560
It poisons their stomach.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.438
You know a lot about roaches, huh?

36:30.563 --> 36:32.773
[chuckles] Unfortunately.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.110
You keep your place clean though.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.698
I thought I was gonna have to point out
their attraction to crumbs.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.911
-Yeah, I like my shit tight.
-[chuckles]

36:46.162 --> 36:47.246
Yeah.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.875
Brenton wasn't like that
in the same regard.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.046
If this is tight, he kept his room loose.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.216
Real loose.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.011
Yeah. It ain't much, but it works for now.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.514
And what about tomorrow?

37:05.598 --> 37:06.807
I got plans.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.478
I wrote down this Thomas Edison quote.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.772
He's the light bulb dude.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.690
Something like...

37:15.566 --> 37:18.402
"Vision without executing it
is just a hallucination."

37:21.072 --> 37:23.157
You know, you got to put your plan
into action.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.493
I mean, this shit here is temporary.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.038
By the time I'm your age,
I'll probably have like two houses

37:29.121 --> 37:31.582
-and my own ranch or something.
-[chuckles]

37:32.416 --> 37:34.835
All right. You want to give it a shot?

37:34.919 --> 37:36.337
I'll supervise.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.924
-Mess up my stomach?
-Not unless you plan to eat it.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.094
Yeah, maybe show me again.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.929
Yeah, you're a businessman.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.814
You gonna show me or what?

37:56.274 --> 37:57.358
Yeah, I'll show you.

38:05.408 --> 38:09.036
The room's paid for, so you ain't got
to sleep in that funky-ass car no more.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.293
Gotta yourself some quiet here.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.796
Find some peace.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.968
Let Isaiah know where you're at.

38:32.018 --> 38:32.852
[opens drawer]

38:34.937 --> 38:35.771
[closes drawer]

38:36.355 --> 38:37.565
I took the clip out.

38:39.025 --> 38:42.737
So you ain't gotta be bothering yourself
with no more ideas about that gun.

38:44.572 --> 38:50.328
I plead with Brenton every night
in my dreams.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.377
I say to him,
"Baby, what were you doing out there?"

39:01.213 --> 39:04.675
And then he says,
"Mom, I was waiting for you.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.928
But you never came.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.807
You never came."

39:12.683 --> 39:17.271
Tricey, you ain't no killer,
so this ain't something to lament.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.693
Then I got nothing left.

39:24.779 --> 39:25.905
Nothing.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.952
You say I ought to find peace.

39:33.496 --> 39:34.580
Where?

39:36.082 --> 39:37.958
Where am I gonna find that now?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.734
[baby crying]

40:13.577 --> 40:14.912
[crying stops]

40:39.854 --> 40:41.188
[protestors chanting]

40:41.272 --> 40:42.815

<i>-No peace!</i>

40:42.898 --> 40:44.650

[protestors continue chanting]

40:49.989 --> 40:51.031
[DiAngelo] Excuse me.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.329
-Get them the fuck out of here.
-Go ahead.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.668
Crazy fucking shit, huh?

41:03.627 --> 41:06.881
Captain called in every cop
in the district. It's going down.

41:07.923 --> 41:09.967
He's gone. It's over.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.053
Where'd he go?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.140
I did what I said I'd fucking do.
It's over.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.892
[protestors continue chanting]

41:24.607 --> 41:27.026
Teresa's alibi from after the hospital
checks out.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.487
She was at the hair salon
in Bayonne by 8:00 a.m.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.989
Some octogenarian who needed a perm.

41:32.072 --> 41:35.159
Her boss says that her day
was packed with hair shit until five.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.119
And who's her pregnant cousin?

41:37.203 --> 41:38.579
Hospital won't release the records.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.915
-Confidentiality bullshit.
-[toy plays "Pop! Goes The Weasel"]

41:40.998 --> 41:43.501
I'll serve them
with a grand jury subpoena.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.461
Probably won't have anything
until the morning.

41:45.544 --> 41:48.422
If Teresa had social media accounts,
she deleted them. Hey. Do you mind?

41:48.506 --> 41:49.548
[music stops]

41:51.300 --> 41:54.762
A riot's breaking out,
this dipshit's playing with a toy.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.767
Get the fuck off my desk. Get ready!
Don't you see what's going on?

41:59.850 --> 42:01.393
-Are you kidding me?
-You kidding me?

42:01.477 --> 42:03.145
-Back off.
-Go fuck yourself! You're an asshole!

42:03.229 --> 42:06.273
Am I the only one that thinks it's weird
that Wilcox has a toy?

42:07.274 --> 42:10.569
Toys are appropriate for children,
and he's a child, so...

42:11.695 --> 42:13.239
But why does he have that thing?

42:14.323 --> 42:17.451
Why? You want to borrow it?
You're bad as the rest of them.

42:18.410 --> 42:21.330
There was cake from a baby shower thing
when I first got here.

42:21.413 --> 42:26.460
And Osorio said that one of the guys
on his team just had a-- had a baby,

42:26.877 --> 42:28.212
and that's why the cake.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.175
Okay. Wait, so--

42:33.259 --> 42:35.678
Wilcox with this toy.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.224
Wilcox doesn't have a kid.
DiAngelo doesn't have a kid.

42:41.684 --> 42:42.810
Osorio...

42:44.645 --> 42:46.272
He's got a four-year-old daughter.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.567
But he said that someone on the team
had just had a baby.

42:51.777 --> 42:54.989
Teresa said that her pregnant cousin's
husband was working that morning

42:55.072 --> 42:57.324
and that's why he couldn't take her
to the hospital.

42:58.409 --> 43:02.162
And she kept making a point of it,
like she kept talking about the husband.

43:04.331 --> 43:07.167
-Pull up the parking lot footage. Now.
-Mmm.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.547
No, she said he came later.
You have to fast-forward past this.

43:11.630 --> 43:12.506
Okay.

43:15.634 --> 43:16.552
[KJ] Stop.

43:20.723 --> 43:21.849
Blue SUV.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.560
-Get it with the lobby.
-Yeah.

43:31.483 --> 43:33.110
[KJ] Back it up. Stop.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.195
[Fish] That's him.

43:37.656 --> 43:38.657
That's our boy.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.578
-Where's the printer?
-Already on it.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.545
Stay here. See if you can match the photo
and get a name.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.130
I'll take a copy to Latrice.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.854
-How'd you know--
-Your husband told me you were here.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.147
We need to talk.

44:11.065 --> 44:11.940
Please.

44:17.154 --> 44:17.988
Um...

44:18.947 --> 44:21.325
Is this the man you saw
in your son's room?

44:22.993 --> 44:24.244
I don't know.

44:24.328 --> 44:28.165
You know. But you won't tell me,
and there's a difference.

44:28.248 --> 44:31.835
Look at him and tell me
this isn't the man who killed your son.

44:32.586 --> 44:36.590
Don't you want him to pay?
For what he did to you, your family?

44:36.674 --> 44:37.716
Your son?

44:39.134 --> 44:40.135
He will.

44:41.095 --> 44:41.970
What did you say?

44:42.054 --> 44:44.431
-You gotta go. Get out of my room.
-What did you do?

44:44.515 --> 44:46.433
-Tell me what you did to him.
-Who cares?

44:46.517 --> 44:48.102
Who cares?

44:49.103 --> 44:51.271
Nobody cared about what happened
to my son!

44:52.398 --> 44:56.318
He was just another black boy that was
laying out there just waiting to die.

44:56.402 --> 44:59.446
No one cared. No one came for him. No one!

44:59.988 --> 45:01.698
He's gonna get what he deserves.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.326
He's gonna pay, believe me.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.744
And he will.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.955
But not this way.

45:08.038 --> 45:11.458
If you want him to pay,
and I mean really pay,

45:11.542 --> 45:14.294
he needs to look you in your eyes
and say it.

45:15.087 --> 45:16.338
Say what he did.

45:17.214 --> 45:19.258
Because if he doesn't, the others--

45:19.341 --> 45:22.886
and there were others
at that ditch that morning...

45:23.679 --> 45:24.763
they'll go free.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.810
And they will never pay
for what they did to your son, to you.

45:30.769 --> 45:32.813
So, please, Mrs. Butler,

45:32.896 --> 45:36.650
is this the man you saw
in your son's hospital room?

45:42.156 --> 45:44.408
His name is Peter Jablonski.

45:45.701 --> 45:46.910
[exhales]

45:54.251 --> 45:55.669
What is it, Mrs. Butler?

45:58.046 --> 45:59.339
Who are you here to see?

45:59.923 --> 46:03.260
[Seth] Officer Peter Jablonski.

46:03.343 --> 46:04.761
He know what this is about?

46:07.014 --> 46:09.224
Yeah. He does.

46:10.350 --> 46:11.351
Have a seat.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.616
[woman]<i> My brother was 12 years old!</i>

46:26.074 --> 46:28.911
Twelve years old
and they shot him down dead!

46:28.994 --> 46:30.370
And the man who killed him,

46:30.454 --> 46:33.707
the cop who put a gun
to my baby brother's head

46:33.790 --> 46:37.169
and took his life is free today!

46:37.252 --> 46:38.504
Justice!

46:38.587 --> 46:40.255
Now!

46:40.339 --> 46:41.465
Justice!

The uncle, Seth Butler, is unaccounted for
and he has a gun.

46:58.398 --> 46:59.650
<i>He's looking for him.</i>

46:59.733 --> 47:03.904
<i>Fish, please, let's avoid</i>
<i>any more heartache for this family.</i>

47:11.620 --> 47:13.288
[protestors yelling indistinctly]

47:24.800 --> 47:28.470
Hey, anyone seen an Officer Jablonski
around? He's got a visitor.

47:29.054 --> 47:29.888
Uh...

47:30.305 --> 47:31.932
Uh, I-I got it.

47:42.150 --> 47:44.778
I don't think I ever thanked you
for your service, did I?

47:48.490 --> 47:51.034
Air Force, yeah? What do they call
you guys? Like Zoomies?

47:51.118 --> 47:52.077
[nervous chuckle]

47:59.501 --> 48:02.546
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, listen, listen.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.009
We got him.

48:10.262 --> 48:13.307
So, if you got a clear head,
you're gonna surrender that weapon.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.352
I ain't surrendering shit.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.063
-[man on bullhorn] What do we want?
-[crowd] Justice!

48:20.147 --> 48:21.607
-When do we want it?
-Now!

48:21.690 --> 48:23.317
-What do we want?
-Justice!

48:23.400 --> 48:24.776
-When do we want it?
-Now!

48:24.860 --> 48:26.528
[protestors continue chanting]

48:36.705 --> 48:38.415
All right.
Well, here's what's gonna happen.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.251
You're gonna get yourself killed.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.839
You know what's some shit?

48:48.342 --> 48:51.094
If I die overseas, I'm a hero.

48:53.013 --> 48:55.891
But if I catch a bullet in my own streets,
I'm a thug.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.602
And ain't neither one of those the truth.

49:04.566 --> 49:06.485
You called my nephew a thug.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.403
You and all the rest.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.115
It's true. I did.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.700
How's it feel?

49:14.868 --> 49:17.204
Being the one
on the working end of a Glock?

49:19.831 --> 49:22.125
Being a prisoner on your own streets?

49:24.544 --> 49:26.129
Do you hear them out there?

49:27.381 --> 49:29.091
These ain't our streets.

49:30.759 --> 49:32.302
This ain't my country.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.140
I was a fool to ever believe it was.

49:39.476 --> 49:41.311
I came here to do one thing.

49:41.895 --> 49:44.231
And that's to meet the man
who killed my nephew.

49:45.357 --> 49:46.441
Deliver him a message.

49:46.525 --> 49:50.487
Cops lives matter!
Cops lives matter! Cops lives matter!

49:50.570 --> 49:52.239
-What do we want?
-Justice!

49:52.322 --> 49:53.907
-When do we want it?
-Now!

49:53.990 --> 49:55.409
-What do we want?
-Justice!

49:55.492 --> 49:56.993
-When do we want it?
-Now!

49:57.077 --> 49:58.787
[protestors continue chanting]

50:03.709 --> 50:06.128
[officer over bullhorn] You are
in violation of a peaceful assembly.

50:06.211 --> 50:08.005
You must disperse immediately.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.090
[officer continues indistinctly]

50:10.966 --> 50:12.509
You know that's not gonna happen.

50:14.511 --> 50:15.637
'Cause he's not here.

50:18.181 --> 50:19.099
Give me the gun.

50:21.226 --> 50:23.145
He needs to look at what he did.

50:24.980 --> 50:29.025
-He needs to know what he did.
-No, you don't want to do that.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.318
I want him to see...

50:30.402 --> 50:31.987
-I want him to see...
-Just don't.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.117
...who Brenton was.

50:39.786 --> 50:41.121
Not a thug.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.372
Not a punk.

50:43.248 --> 50:46.960
Not just some black kid on the street.
Just... Just a kid.

50:49.087 --> 50:52.007
They got his mug shot
on every TV and paper,

50:52.090 --> 50:54.843
and they think they know who he is,
but they don't.

51:00.766 --> 51:04.811
This... is who Brenton Butler was.

51:09.107 --> 51:10.025
May I?

51:24.331 --> 51:27.876
Hey, hey, hey. Listen. Go home, okay?

51:28.585 --> 51:29.878
-[glass breaks]
-[people scream]

51:29.961 --> 51:32.297
[overlapping chatter]

51:34.090 --> 51:36.009
[officer] You are in violation
of a peaceful assembly.

51:36.092 --> 51:37.928
-We want justice!
-That's right!

51:38.011 --> 51:38.887
We're staying!

51:38.970 --> 51:41.431
We want justice!

51:41.515 --> 51:43.517
[overlapping shouts]

51:51.316 --> 51:52.317
Yeah!

51:53.443 --> 51:56.113
This is for Brenton! This is for Brenton!

51:57.322 --> 51:59.116
[shouting]

52:01.993 --> 52:03.912
-[woman screams]
-Hey, Wilcox! Stop!

52:03.995 --> 52:06.540
No, chill! Manny! Manny, come on, man!

52:07.582 --> 52:08.625
There!

52:10.377 --> 52:11.294
Run!

52:11.378 --> 52:13.088
[overlapping shouts]

52:45.996 --> 52:47.664
[KJ] Fish, we missed him.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.332
He's gone.

52:50.750 --> 52:53.003
His wife tipped him off
when unis got here.

52:55.422 --> 52:58.508
I called Connelly. He is notifying Medina.

52:58.592 --> 52:59.676
Arrest the others.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.978
-[sirens wailing nearby]
-[low indistinct chatter]

53:14.191 --> 53:15.442
-Thanks.
-Good job.

53:20.363 --> 53:22.532
Medina wants a word with both of you.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.660
Yeah, Sarge. You know what about?

53:26.536 --> 53:27.579
Come with me.

53:46.806 --> 53:49.476
Pete Jablonski.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.646
He was driving the blue Ford
that hit the kid.

53:54.564 --> 53:55.899
But that's not what killed him.

53:57.108 --> 54:03.281
What killed Brenton Butler
is called depraved indifference.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.798
Stand up and turn around.

54:44.155 --> 54:45.323
It's your career.

54:52.497 --> 54:54.833
Please tell me
you at least fucked her by now.

54:58.169 --> 54:59.713
I'm guessing that's a no.

55:05.468 --> 55:06.302
Let's go.

55:11.725 --> 55:14.019
[indistinct police radio chatter]

55:16.563 --> 55:17.480
[sighs]

55:29.951 --> 55:31.161
You shouldn't be here.

55:32.829 --> 55:33.830
Seth?

55:33.913 --> 55:36.708
He was at the district, but he is fine.

55:36.791 --> 55:37.876
He wasn't arrested.

55:41.796 --> 55:42.839
And him?

55:43.339 --> 55:45.175
We got the other three.

55:45.675 --> 55:47.177
He can't have gone far.

55:47.719 --> 55:50.180
We put out a BOLO and we will find him.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.600
But in the meantime, you should go home.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.358
I'll call you as soon as I hear anything,
okay?

56:21.378 --> 56:22.504
[engine stops]

56:23.463 --> 56:24.297
[KJ scoffs]

56:49.322 --> 56:52.242
-I just want to say goodbye to my son.
-[officer] Go, go.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.369
-[officers speak indistinctly]
-Petey!

56:55.912 --> 56:58.373
[officer] Put your hands against the car,
sir, right now.

57:06.047 --> 57:07.257
I can't allow that.

57:14.139 --> 57:17.225
You're under arrest, Officer Jablonski.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.927
-[officer 1] Here we go.
-[officer 2] All right.

57:57.015 --> 57:58.850
Okay. Watch your head.

58:02.020 --> 58:04.481
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[engine starts]

58:12.155 --> 58:13.448
[siren wailing]
