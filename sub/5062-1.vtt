19:51.394 --> 19:52.778
I hate cell phones.

19:52.779 --> 19:53.962
I don't want anyone else

19:53.963 --> 19:55.664
to have that number.

19:55.665 --> 19:58.067
I called Jenn.

19:58.068 --> 19:59.635
You told me
you haven't spoken to her.

19:59.636 --> 20:01.503
- I hung up.
- So you haven't spoken

20:01.504 --> 20:02.905
to Jenn in three weeks?

20:02.906 --> 20:04.873
That's correct.

20:04.874 --> 20:06.809
Tell me about addiction.

20:06.810 --> 20:08.777
- What about it?
- Drugs.

20:08.778 --> 20:10.112
Mm-mmm.

20:10.113 --> 20:11.480
This is not about you.

20:11.481 --> 20:12.815
How do you know?

20:12.816 --> 20:14.283
'Cause I know a lot
about addiction.

20:14.284 --> 20:16.952
You're not a candidate
for pills.

20:16.953 --> 20:19.154
Booze is your drug of choice.

20:19.155 --> 20:20.566
Did you come here for help,

20:20.591 --> 20:22.135
or did you come here
for information?

20:22.492 --> 20:24.526
I came here for help...

20:24.527 --> 20:26.428
and information.

20:29.099 --> 20:31.400
I busted this kid
a couple of years ago.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.502
- For using drugs?
- Drunk and disorderly.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.003
Her mom's very well-off.

20:35.004 --> 20:37.039
One of those big houses
out in Paradise Point.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.407
Divorced.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.142
An ugly one.

20:40.143 --> 20:41.610
Mom wanted to take her home.

20:41.611 --> 20:43.479
I insisted she spend the
night in the Paradise jail.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.947
That sounds like you.

20:44.948 --> 20:46.682
Talked to her
most of the night--

20:46.683 --> 20:48.150
good kid; missed her dad.

20:48.151 --> 20:50.886
I said that I was her friend
and that I'd keep in touch.

20:50.887 --> 20:52.688
That sounds like you.

20:52.689 --> 20:53.989
Mom put her
in rehab.

20:53.990 --> 20:55.991
One of those expensive places
in Boston.

20:55.992 --> 20:58.393
When she got out,
she went back to college.

20:58.394 --> 20:59.795
And you kept in touch.

20:59.796 --> 21:01.597
I did.

21:01.598 --> 21:03.632
For a while.

21:03.633 --> 21:05.067
What happened?

21:05.068 --> 21:07.736
She's dead.

21:07.737 --> 21:09.204
Drugs?

21:11.040 --> 21:13.242
Most likely.

21:13.243 --> 21:16.545
Did they give her
prescription drugs

21:16.546 --> 21:17.613
when she left rehab?

21:17.614 --> 21:19.414
I have no idea.

21:19.415 --> 21:22.317
When I asked you what happened,

21:22.318 --> 21:24.653
I meant, why did you
lose contact with her?

21:24.654 --> 21:26.722
I guess I got preoccupied

21:26.723 --> 21:28.824
with my favorite subject.

21:28.825 --> 21:29.925
What subject's that?

21:29.926 --> 21:31.760
Me.

21:31.761 --> 21:34.229
Did I ever tell you

21:34.230 --> 21:36.365
you have a hyperactive sense
of responsibility?

21:36.366 --> 21:38.600
You did.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.536
Well, let's recap.

21:40.537 --> 21:43.105
You live
where no one can find you.

21:43.106 --> 21:44.606
You drink alone.

21:44.607 --> 21:47.242
You've talked
to your ex-wife

21:47.243 --> 21:50.112
every day
since your divorce.

21:50.113 --> 21:52.414
You've cut yourself off
from her for three weeks.

21:52.415 --> 21:56.518
And now you feel responsible
for this kid's death.

21:56.519 --> 21:59.021
That's about it.

21:59.022 --> 22:01.056
Before you came here yesterday,
I hadn't seen you

22:01.057 --> 22:03.358
in a month.
Three weeks.

22:03.359 --> 22:04.793
We need to spend more time

22:04.794 --> 22:06.295
together.

22:06.296 --> 22:07.896
Once a month
is not enough.

22:07.897 --> 22:10.933
If you say so.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.409
I got wasted last night.

22:22.245 --> 22:24.596
Okay.

22:25.515 --> 22:27.549
And that's why you called me.

22:27.550 --> 22:30.185
(sighs)

22:30.186 --> 22:32.421
That's correct.

22:41.167 --> 22:43.868
LUTHOR: <i>If you need me,</i>
<i>I'll be at the speed trap, sir.</i>

22:43.869 --> 22:45.603
I think it would be
more appropriate not to refer

22:45.604 --> 22:46.805
to the entrance to Paradise

22:46.806 --> 22:48.039
as the speed trap.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.607
I understand, sir.

22:49.608 --> 22:51.743
You don't have
to call me sir.

22:51.744 --> 22:53.711
Did you get the medical
examiner's report, Luthor?

22:53.712 --> 22:56.030
Sir, that won't come in
until toxicology is finalized.

22:56.031 --> 22:59.617
Doc Perkins' preliminary finding
showed no sign of foul play.

22:59.618 --> 23:01.753
Drug overdose
is most likely the...

23:01.754 --> 23:03.188
Cause of death. Good.

23:06.697 --> 23:07.831
I'm sorry.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.179
I didn't mean it that way.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.931
It's a horrible tragedy,
but at least

23:10.932 --> 23:12.616
there's no indication
of a crime.

23:12.617 --> 23:14.484
Suicide's a crime.

23:14.485 --> 23:16.119
Only technically.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.622
What I meant was,
lots of kids OD.

23:18.623 --> 23:21.024
But crime is bad for tourism,
and tourism

23:21.025 --> 23:21.992
is Paradise's
main business.

23:21.993 --> 23:22.993
I know that, sir.

23:22.994 --> 23:24.327
We may have
gotten lucky here.

23:24.328 --> 23:25.996
It didn't make
this morning's paper,

23:25.997 --> 23:28.131
and I think
we can get the Town Council

23:28.132 --> 23:30.100
to exert some influence
over at the <i>Gazette.</i>

23:30.101 --> 23:32.302
Headline it
something like,

23:32.303 --> 23:33.837
"Boston College Student
Found Dead

23:33.838 --> 23:35.372
of Drug Overdose on Beach Road."

23:35.373 --> 23:37.040
But she lives here.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.944
No, her Mom lives here;
she lived at school in Boston.

23:40.945 --> 23:42.812
What do you think, Luthor?

23:42.813 --> 23:46.516
My sense is,
we need to tell the truth, sir.

23:46.517 --> 23:48.585
That is the truth.

23:57.612 --> 23:59.829
(cell phone ringing)

24:00.865 --> 24:02.599
(phone beeps on)
Thanks for dinner.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.950
ROSE:
Are you okay?

24:03.951 --> 24:05.235
I'm fine. Is he there?

24:05.236 --> 24:06.403
He is.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.954
How do you feel about that?

24:07.955 --> 24:09.539
How do I feel about that?

24:09.540 --> 24:10.774
Got to go.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.614
STONE:
Thelma.

24:17.615 --> 24:20.050
Jesse.

24:21.485 --> 24:23.920
Can I help you, Jesse?

24:24.722 --> 24:26.990
Your hair smells
of violets.

24:26.991 --> 24:28.425
Do you know what
violets smell like?

24:28.426 --> 24:30.594
No, but I'm sure violets
would smell that way

24:30.595 --> 24:32.195
if I'd ever
smelled a violet.

24:32.196 --> 24:34.130
I don't mean this
in any negative way,

24:34.131 --> 24:36.299
but you are maybe the simplest
person I've ever met.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.367
In what way?

24:37.368 --> 24:38.685
You know what you want.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.936
<i>Sometimes</i> I know what I want.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.171
You know what you want
right now.

24:41.172 --> 24:42.806
I do.

24:42.807 --> 24:43.607
Are you going to tell me?

24:43.608 --> 24:44.674
I can't tell you.

24:44.675 --> 24:46.309
You know what you want,

24:46.310 --> 24:47.844
but you can't tell me.

24:47.845 --> 24:49.779
I don't want to presume.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.114
I see.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.549
I can tell you what I'm hoping.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.251
Tell me what you're hoping.

24:54.252 --> 24:57.787
I'm hoping
I can see you sometime.

24:58.954 --> 25:02.089
You mean you're hoping
that you can see me again.

25:02.215 --> 25:04.116
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Jesse.

25:05.253 --> 25:08.088
I came early.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.830
Mrs. Gleffey's a hottie.

25:14.899 --> 25:16.066
Hadn't noticed.

25:16.067 --> 25:17.734
So you're done
with your ex-wife?

25:17.735 --> 25:20.837
Oh, didn't say that.

25:20.838 --> 25:22.372
I'm obsessed
with Thelma, but

25:22.373 --> 25:24.241
I'm in love with Cissy.

25:24.242 --> 25:26.877
Have you talked to her
since she moved to Boston?

25:26.878 --> 25:28.812
How would you know
she moved to Boston?

25:28.813 --> 25:29.980
Small town.

25:29.981 --> 25:33.083
You and Cissy...?

25:33.084 --> 25:34.618
Me and Cissy what, Hasty?

25:36.220 --> 25:38.255
(sighing):
She won't return my calls.

25:38.256 --> 25:39.723
Nice.

25:39.724 --> 25:45.095
Well, I just closed
on a slightly used Beamer M6.

25:45.096 --> 25:47.130
Minty.

25:47.131 --> 25:48.999
Can you imagine?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.801
Who's the lucky guy, Hasty?

25:50.802 --> 25:52.335
Don't ask.

25:52.336 --> 25:53.670
Could you turn that thing off?

25:53.671 --> 25:55.872
I can.

26:00.144 --> 26:02.195
So,

26:02.196 --> 26:03.747
how's the drinking thing going?

26:03.748 --> 26:05.482
(sighs)

26:05.483 --> 26:07.717
I'm very fond of you, Jesse.

26:07.718 --> 26:09.486
I know that, Hasty.
Can I tell you something?

26:09.487 --> 26:10.654
Do I have a choice?

26:10.655 --> 26:12.422
I'm running for Town Council.

26:12.423 --> 26:13.590
Hasty, you're a felon.

26:13.591 --> 26:15.158
So's Marion Barry.

26:15.159 --> 26:17.661
I got one word for you, Jesse--
redemption.

26:17.662 --> 26:19.196
Are you going to church?

26:19.197 --> 26:21.364
No. That's my platform--
redemption.

26:21.365 --> 26:23.500
I'm sorry. This shouldn't
just be about me.

26:23.501 --> 26:25.836
(sighs)

26:25.837 --> 26:27.204
Don't you think
I've got a winner?

26:27.205 --> 26:28.605
Redemption. Just one word.

26:28.606 --> 26:29.840
It's easy to get emotionally.

26:29.841 --> 26:31.741
(hits fist on hand)
Kind of punches you in the gut.

26:31.742 --> 26:33.743
I don't like the train.

26:33.744 --> 26:35.045
Lets me think too much.

26:35.046 --> 26:37.047
Excuse me?

26:37.048 --> 26:40.100
You know that car
you let me drive?

26:40.101 --> 26:41.952
- Test-drive.
- Can I drive it to Boston?

26:41.953 --> 26:43.362
You already test-drove it.

26:43.387 --> 26:45.571
Perhaps you could
consider it a loaner.

26:45.790 --> 26:47.958
That would imply you got a car
in here for repair.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.659
You have my Scout.
You're repairing it.
(laughs)

26:49.660 --> 26:51.561
Your Scout's beyond repair.
It's a rusted hulk.

26:51.562 --> 26:52.829
Exactly.

26:52.830 --> 26:54.931
CINDY:
<i>But I don't know</i>

26:54.932 --> 26:56.116
what that's supposed to mean.

26:56.117 --> 26:57.667
- You're saying I have issues?
- You do.

26:57.668 --> 26:59.202
How would you
know that?

26:59.203 --> 27:00.770
I'm the police chief.

27:00.771 --> 27:02.739
- I know everything.
- So I have to spend the night

27:02.740 --> 27:04.574
in jail?
We both do.

27:04.575 --> 27:06.009
What is that supposed to mean?

27:06.010 --> 27:08.578
If you spend the night in jail,
I can't go home.

27:08.579 --> 27:09.613
You can't put me in jail

27:09.614 --> 27:11.114
just because you think
that I have issues.

27:11.115 --> 27:12.300
No, I can't.

27:12.305 --> 27:13.505
And my mom wanted
me out of here.

27:13.518 --> 27:14.851
She did.

27:14.852 --> 27:16.820
So then, why can't I go home?

27:16.821 --> 27:18.021
Public drunkenness is illegal.

27:18.022 --> 27:20.190
- This is not right!
- I'm not in the right

27:20.191 --> 27:22.359
and wrong business; I'm in
the legal and illegal business.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.527
You don't make any sense.

27:23.528 --> 27:26.062
(loud horn honking,
tires screeching)

27:29.734 --> 27:31.935
(heavy sigh)

27:45.149 --> 27:48.335
(jackhammer pounding)

27:52.023 --> 27:56.560
(car horn honking)

28:03.903 --> 28:05.088
BUTLER:
<i>Detective Gammon,</i>

28:05.145 --> 28:06.862
can I talk to you
for a moment?

28:06.863 --> 28:08.013
We don't have
detectives, sir.

28:08.414 --> 28:09.715
Well, what should I call you?

28:09.716 --> 28:11.650
Rose.

28:11.651 --> 28:13.385
Well, Rose, as you know,
we're understaffed here.

28:13.386 --> 28:15.787
We lost a very good man
when Detective DeAngelo left.

28:15.788 --> 28:18.890
I'm sorry. How do we refer
to our personnel?

28:18.891 --> 28:19.991
As "Officers," sir.

28:19.992 --> 28:21.960
Chief Stone had a
problem in that...

28:21.961 --> 28:23.862
He didn't like Officer D'Angelo.

28:23.863 --> 28:25.731
That isn't what
I was going to say, sir.

28:25.732 --> 28:27.299
You don't have
to call me sir, Rose.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.533
What should I call you?

28:28.534 --> 28:30.802
I don't know.
How about "Chief"?

28:30.803 --> 28:34.106
Well, Chief,
the former chief felt

28:34.107 --> 28:36.875
that Officer D'Angelo spent
too much time writing tickets.

28:36.876 --> 28:38.777
- That's a good thing.
- Tickets bring in...

28:38.778 --> 28:40.212
Lot of revenue.

28:40.213 --> 28:42.114
Anyway, being shorthanded,

28:42.115 --> 28:44.716
I'm going to need you here
manning your desk.

28:46.419 --> 28:47.819
This has nothing to do
with you being a woman.

28:47.820 --> 28:48.987
I want you to know that, Rose.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.356
You need someone

28:51.357 --> 28:54.192
to man the telephones,

28:54.193 --> 28:56.328
to be a kind of dispatcher.

28:56.329 --> 28:59.264
I prefer
that you think of it more

28:59.265 --> 29:02.067
as a temporary kind of
home guard action.

29:02.068 --> 29:05.237

29:28.561 --> 29:30.662
Thank you.

29:30.663 --> 29:34.099
I guess it takes me 24
hours to get offended.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.301
You could have called.

29:38.137 --> 29:40.138
I'm in a dead zone.

29:40.139 --> 29:42.207
Okay.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.476
Truth is, I forgot.

29:44.477 --> 29:46.394
By the time I thought

29:46.395 --> 29:47.946
to call you,
it was raining again.

29:47.947 --> 29:49.147
Was it important?

29:49.148 --> 29:50.816
I don't know.

29:50.817 --> 29:52.818
I got a perp on trial

29:52.819 --> 29:54.886
for robbery and murder.

29:54.887 --> 29:55.987
What's your problem?

29:55.988 --> 29:58.423
What makes you think
I got a problem?

29:58.424 --> 30:00.459
Every time
you stop by

30:00.460 --> 30:02.327
to see how I'm doing,
either you got a problem,

30:02.328 --> 30:03.462
or I got a problem.

30:03.463 --> 30:05.530
Well... <i>you've</i> got a problem.

30:05.531 --> 30:06.598
So do you.

30:06.599 --> 30:07.566

30:11.971 --> 30:14.539
(chattering stops, door closes)

30:16.609 --> 30:18.577
I don't think
the perp's the perp.

30:18.578 --> 30:20.078
Excuse me?

30:20.079 --> 30:22.013
I don't think he did it.

30:22.014 --> 30:23.982
Did what?

30:23.983 --> 30:26.017
Robbed a liquor store,
got the money,

30:26.018 --> 30:28.386
shot the owner
in the face three times.

30:28.387 --> 30:29.788
Nice.

30:29.789 --> 30:32.440
Your bust?

30:32.441 --> 30:36.428
No. One of my ambitious
college students.

30:36.429 --> 30:39.130
Case is a slam dunk.

30:39.131 --> 30:40.899
Eyewitness ID.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.701
Credit card receipts,
cell phone records

30:42.702 --> 30:45.403

at the right time.

30:45.404 --> 30:47.072
Final arguments are today.

30:47.073 --> 30:48.373
And you got a problem?

30:48.374 --> 30:49.374
I do.

30:49.375 --> 30:50.909
Why do you have a problem?

30:50.910 --> 30:52.210
Coply intuition.

30:54.514 --> 30:56.448
If I set it up,
will you talk to him?

30:56.449 --> 30:58.216
I will.

30:58.217 --> 30:59.851
Just one thing.

31:00.987 --> 31:04.089
This time,
I want to be deputized.

31:05.525 --> 31:07.459
You want to be a consultant
who's deputized?

31:07.460 --> 31:10.996

to carry a badge again.

College doesn't reveal

31:43.062 --> 31:44.229

Not even to family.

31:45.398 --> 31:47.499
What if the parents
were paying the bills?

31:47.500 --> 31:48.867
The privacy and integrity

31:48.868 --> 31:50.485

32:05.167 --> 32:06.351
in achievement
over the last year.

32:06.352 --> 32:07.986
And, of course, she
dropped out of school

32:11.123 --> 32:13.124
Could you be mistaken?

32:13.125 --> 32:15.560
I don't think so.

32:15.561 --> 32:17.262
Was anyone informed?

32:17.263 --> 32:18.630
There's no need.

32:18.631 --> 32:19.898
Her tuition was paid for
in advance,

32:19.899 --> 32:20.999
and it's not refundable.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.167
Why do you want to know?

32:22.168 --> 32:24.369
She's dead.

41:11.791 --> 41:13.558
She was pretty wasted.

41:13.559 --> 41:15.794
Was she drunk?

41:15.795 --> 41:17.195
No, drugs.

41:17.196 --> 41:19.130
Maybe painkillers.
For sure she was shooting smack.

41:19.131 --> 41:21.699
I saw the tracks.
(sighs)

41:21.700 --> 41:25.170
What do you know about
a place called Tranquility?

41:25.171 --> 41:27.205
They give families
the answers they want to hear.

41:27.206 --> 41:29.641
They cost a lot,
don't do much good,

41:29.642 --> 41:30.942
and can be part
of the problem.

41:30.943 --> 41:32.444
This kid went in for alcohol

41:32.445 --> 41:34.379
and came out
with prescription drugs.

41:34.380 --> 41:36.147
Well, heroin's the main course,
but they might've

41:36.148 --> 41:37.482
provided the appetizers.

41:37.483 --> 41:40.251
Places like Tranquility
just substitute addictions.

41:40.252 --> 41:44.189
No follow-up, no exit strategy,
it's a rehab mill.

41:46.525 --> 41:48.927
I'm starting to rant, that's
not part of my job description.

41:54.533 --> 41:56.134
She's dead, isn't she?

41:56.135 --> 41:58.203
Yes.

41:58.204 --> 41:59.737
What was her name?

41:59.738 --> 42:02.841
Cindy Van Aldan.

42:03.642 --> 42:05.844
Thank you.

42:12.451 --> 42:13.985
Can I ask you something?

42:13.986 --> 42:17.088
You can.

42:17.089 --> 42:19.457
Is Cindy the reason
we're having dinner, Jesse?

42:19.458 --> 42:21.159
Yes.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.694
Was there any other reason?

42:24.530 --> 42:26.131
Yes.

42:26.132 --> 42:28.800
So you think we might've
had dinner otherwise?

42:30.636 --> 42:31.836
Yes.

42:31.837 --> 42:33.938
Last time you said

42:33.939 --> 42:35.173
you didn't know what to do
with dinner with a nun.

42:35.174 --> 42:37.675
How did I do, Sister?

42:37.676 --> 42:39.477
You did just fine.

42:39.478 --> 42:44.015
Figure if I practice,
I'll get it right.

42:46.385 --> 42:49.220
I just...

42:49.221 --> 42:52.390
...like you.

42:53.259 --> 42:56.494
I like you, Jesse.

43:27.226 --> 43:31.429
Most men and women lead
lives of quiet desperation.

43:31.430 --> 43:32.997
That's a quote from someplace.

43:32.998 --> 43:35.533
My desperations are never quiet.

43:37.369 --> 43:39.237
I got hats older than you.

43:39.238 --> 43:42.207
We found a common interest.

43:42.208 --> 43:44.876
Used cars?

43:44.877 --> 43:47.078
Sex.

43:47.079 --> 43:48.630
Anyone special?

43:48.631 --> 43:49.814
That I'm having sex with?

43:49.815 --> 43:51.282
I'm not seeing anyone
at the moment.

43:51.283 --> 43:52.767
I'm divorced.

43:52.768 --> 43:55.436
I knew that. Why are you
still carrying a gun?

43:55.437 --> 43:56.955
Peace of mind.

43:56.956 --> 43:58.623
Do you always carry one?

43:58.624 --> 43:59.991
Yes.

43:59.992 --> 44:01.159
I was a cop in L.A.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.228
Always a cop?

44:03.229 --> 44:05.630
No. I played baseball
before I got hurt.

44:05.631 --> 44:07.265
- Were you any good?
- I was very good.

44:07.266 --> 44:10.101
- What do you know.
- Interested.

44:17.610 --> 44:19.177
You over your wife?

44:19.178 --> 44:20.778
Ex-wife.

44:20.779 --> 44:22.914
You over her?

44:22.915 --> 44:24.182
No.

44:24.183 --> 44:25.350
You looking for a husband?

44:25.351 --> 44:27.752
No.

44:29.588 --> 44:31.789
I've got two kids in college.

44:31.790 --> 44:34.092
You married young.

44:34.093 --> 44:36.294
I did.

44:36.295 --> 44:38.529
Two kids in college,
that's a lot of money.

44:38.530 --> 44:39.597
Their father can afford it.

44:39.598 --> 44:41.099
I raised them, he paid for it.

44:41.100 --> 44:43.735
He's always been good that way.

44:43.736 --> 44:45.470
In what way wasn't he good?

44:45.471 --> 44:48.339
Where his penis led,
he followed.

44:52.144 --> 44:55.313
I enjoyed our dance.

44:55.314 --> 44:56.547
Pressure of possibility.

44:56.548 --> 44:58.449
The way your hips moved
under your dress.

44:58.450 --> 44:59.817
What possibility?

44:59.818 --> 45:02.654
Possibility of seeing you

45:02.655 --> 45:04.839
without the
intervening dress.

45:08.861 --> 45:11.863
I'm not a good basket
to put all your eggs in.

45:11.864 --> 45:13.531
I'm not going to
fall in love with you.

45:13.532 --> 45:15.566
I don't think
you'll fall in love with me.

45:17.303 --> 45:18.536
We can be each other's friend.

45:18.537 --> 45:21.973
We can have some nice,
uncomplicated sex.

45:21.974 --> 45:24.375
I'm going to take a shower.

45:24.376 --> 45:27.612
I wish you could join me.

45:33.212 --> 45:37.512
♪ The water is wide. ♪

45:37.526 --> 45:42.095
♪ I can't cross o'er. ♪

45:42.120 --> 45:52.038

45:52.074 --> 45:57.112

45:57.113 --> 46:00.215

46:39.488 --> 46:41.739
♪ ♪

46:47.563 --> 46:49.597
I don't know why people do that.

46:49.598 --> 46:52.066
It doesn't
do any good.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.907
So, why do you want my picture?

46:58.908 --> 47:01.442
I like you.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.911
Turn that thing off!

47:02.912 --> 47:05.880
What is that about?

47:05.881 --> 47:08.233
It's rude, and I don't like 'em.

47:11.153 --> 47:13.154
They don't work anyway.

47:13.155 --> 47:16.357
Garbage disposals are supposed
to dispose of your garbage,

47:16.358 --> 47:18.326
so why do you have
to sort your garbage

47:18.327 --> 47:20.361
before you only
dispose of some of it?

47:20.362 --> 47:21.696
Same thing.

47:23.165 --> 47:25.700
- Okay.
- Just 'cause you earned back

47:25.701 --> 47:28.136
the right to use it
doesn't mean you have to.

47:30.940 --> 47:32.907
You're not usual.

47:32.908 --> 47:35.777
People your age are always
certain of what's usual.

47:35.778 --> 47:37.111
How would you know that?

47:37.112 --> 47:38.613
I used to be your age.

47:38.614 --> 47:42.350
When's the last time
you talked to your dad?

47:42.351 --> 47:44.953
Not since he went away.

47:44.954 --> 47:46.487
Fathers are important.

47:46.488 --> 47:49.958
Now that you got your cell phone
back, why don't you call him?

47:49.959 --> 47:51.759
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I didn't.

47:51.760 --> 47:52.827
Why doesn't he call me?

47:52.828 --> 47:54.562
I asked you first.

47:54.563 --> 47:56.464
Why won't you
talk to your dad?

47:56.465 --> 48:00.168
Don't get all parental
on me, Jesse, okay?

48:07.042 --> 48:10.645
I'm afraid he won't want
to talk to me.

48:11.513 --> 48:13.581
Okay.

48:13.582 --> 48:16.784
Maybe your dad's afraid
of the same thing.

48:21.824 --> 48:23.975
I got to go to group.

48:24.793 --> 48:26.828
Here.

48:26.829 --> 48:29.764
The divorce
wasn't your fault.

48:31.734 --> 48:35.136
I know something
about divorce.

49:17.857 --> 49:20.587
You can only do
what you can do, Jesse.

49:22.232 --> 49:23.892
When's your gun permit
expire?

49:24.092 --> 49:25.172
I noticed you're carrying.

49:25.184 --> 49:26.451
That's good police work, Chief.

49:26.655 --> 49:28.890
Retired police officers
are entitled to carry.

49:28.891 --> 49:30.541
- It's federal law.
- You were let go.

49:30.542 --> 49:32.560
ROSE: Sir, if you would
care to read

49:32.561 --> 49:33.928
the transcripts
of the Town Council meeting,

49:33.929 --> 49:36.597
I think that you would find
that former Chief Stone

49:36.598 --> 49:38.366
was granted
early retirement.

49:38.367 --> 49:40.301
How generous.

49:40.302 --> 49:42.403
So you're armed
at a funeral?

49:43.170 --> 49:44.204
You can assume I'm...

49:44.224 --> 49:45.157
Always armed.

49:45.158 --> 49:46.492
Don't finish my sentences.

49:46.493 --> 49:47.960
LUTHOR:
Sir, I feel

49:47.961 --> 49:49.662
the department should
formally express

49:49.663 --> 49:51.731
its regrets
to Mrs. Van Aldan.

49:51.732 --> 49:53.633
Cindy did not commit suicide.

49:53.634 --> 49:56.052
It doesn't really matter

49:56.053 --> 49:58.237
if it was an accidental
overdose or suicide.

49:58.238 --> 50:00.406
There's clearly
no sign of foul play.

50:00.407 --> 50:01.741
Looking under rocks
is only gonna cause

50:01.742 --> 50:02.975
that poor mother further grief.

50:02.976 --> 50:04.043
It's just a...

50:04.044 --> 50:06.279
Horrible tragedy.

50:06.280 --> 50:09.048
Stay out of this, Stone.

50:09.049 --> 50:11.217
Luthor, shall we?

50:13.687 --> 50:15.888
You can only do
what you can do.

50:20.077 --> 50:22.762
(sighs)

50:24.247 --> 50:26.098
Was Cindy ever busted?

50:26.099 --> 50:27.133
Jesse...

50:27.134 --> 50:28.668
Did you do a criminal
background check?

50:28.669 --> 50:30.870
He said it wasn't necessary.

50:30.871 --> 50:32.171
But you did one anyway.

50:32.172 --> 50:33.339
He said for you
to stay out of it.

50:33.340 --> 50:35.041
What do you think
he meant by that?

50:35.042 --> 50:36.242
That you stay out of it.

50:36.243 --> 50:40.179
I'm going to find out
one way or the other.

50:41.048 --> 50:43.215
(sighs)

50:44.351 --> 50:47.620
Jesse, Cindy was pretty close
to bottom.

50:47.621 --> 50:49.922
She was busted
two months ago

50:49.923 --> 50:52.825
on possession of heroin
and OxyContin.

50:54.061 --> 50:56.262
And prostitution.

51:05.005 --> 51:07.640
Jury was only out
about three hours.

51:07.641 --> 51:09.709
His attorney
looked stunned.

51:09.710 --> 51:11.544
Guy's got his head
up his ass.

51:11.545 --> 51:12.912
Sorry, Rose.

51:12.913 --> 51:15.715
So the guy has his head
up his ass... and...?

51:15.716 --> 51:18.617
Brand-new public defender
with an oversized ego.

51:18.618 --> 51:20.453
He should have just
pled him guilty.

51:20.454 --> 51:22.088
I'm not sure
he did it.

51:22.089 --> 51:23.225
If you want an argument,

51:23.230 --> 51:25.181
you're gonna have to
change the subject.

51:25.192 --> 51:26.258
How do you know he didn't do it?

51:26.259 --> 51:28.661
I don't. Where do
they got him now?

51:28.662 --> 51:30.129
They'll keep him in County
awaiting sentencing.

51:30.130 --> 51:31.931
You said
there was an eyewitness.

51:31.932 --> 51:33.199
Doesn't mean
it was him.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.434
A lot of white people
are afraid of black people,

51:35.435 --> 51:36.669
won't look 'em in the eye.

51:36.670 --> 51:39.372
What did you get out of him
before the PD shut him up?

51:39.373 --> 51:41.340
He said he was somewhere else
but couldn't prove it.

51:41.341 --> 51:43.909
If you don't like the answers
you're getting,

51:43.910 --> 51:45.277
check your premises.

51:47.247 --> 51:49.448
My new boss just walked in.

51:52.919 --> 51:54.787
You want to put my coat
over your head?

51:54.788 --> 51:57.022
How about I put mine
over yours?

51:57.023 --> 51:59.492
Doesn't look too social.

51:59.493 --> 52:01.961
Who's the guy doing
the finger pointing?

52:01.962 --> 52:04.997
Wealthy local. Runs a high-end
rehab place in Boston.

52:04.998 --> 52:05.998
How do you know that, Jesse?

52:05.999 --> 52:08.100
Small town.

52:08.101 --> 52:09.702
- How's everybody doing?
- Fine.

52:09.703 --> 52:10.536
Rose?

52:10.537 --> 52:11.337
Maybe later.

52:11.338 --> 52:13.038
I'll have one, Laura.

52:13.039 --> 52:16.108
That's two.

52:34.461 --> 52:37.897
Looks like
my boys are still up.

52:37.898 --> 52:40.366
My mom won't say no to them.

52:40.367 --> 52:42.768
How's your new chief?

52:42.769 --> 52:44.637
I don't like him.

52:44.638 --> 52:46.338
You sound like me.

52:50.677 --> 52:53.078
I'm gonna get my job back, Rose.

52:54.514 --> 52:57.049
Fate won't do this to me.

53:00.487 --> 53:03.823
Jesse, have you ever
considered counseling?

53:04.658 --> 53:07.393
You mean, like, a shrink?

53:08.228 --> 53:09.995
Have you ever considered it?

53:09.996 --> 53:12.531
Only crazy people
see shrinks.

53:15.135 --> 53:17.837
I'm seeing one.

53:18.772 --> 53:20.906
You're seeing a shrink?

53:20.907 --> 53:22.107
I am.

53:22.108 --> 53:23.275
Is he any good?

53:23.276 --> 53:25.277
I have nothing to
compare him to.

53:25.278 --> 53:26.912
What's he like?

53:28.815 --> 53:31.083
He's an ex-cop,
so he's unorthodox,

53:31.084 --> 53:33.085
which is good for me.

53:33.086 --> 53:35.020
Knows a lot about addiction...

53:35.021 --> 53:38.190
and divorce,
which would be good for you.

53:43.630 --> 53:45.798
Would he see me?

53:46.666 --> 53:48.968
I'll talk to him.

53:52.105 --> 53:54.406
What are you gonna do, Jesse?

53:55.242 --> 53:57.877
I'm gonna go home
and feed Reggie.

53:57.878 --> 54:00.012
Don't be cute.

54:00.013 --> 54:03.649
It's hard for me not to be cute.

54:03.650 --> 54:05.851
Good night, Jesse.

54:07.821 --> 54:10.089
(dog barking in distance)

54:25.005 --> 54:27.172
(sighs)

54:32.929 --> 54:35.131
(siren wailing in distance)

54:36.066 --> 54:37.547
Hello.

54:37.552 --> 54:38.571
And you would be?

54:38.572 --> 54:40.105
Jesse.

54:40.106 --> 54:41.574
Do you have a last name?

54:41.575 --> 54:43.709
Stone. And you would be?

54:43.710 --> 54:45.077
Amanda.

54:45.078 --> 54:46.312
Do you have a last name?

54:46.313 --> 54:47.780
No.

54:47.781 --> 54:49.248
Do you have an appointment

54:49.249 --> 54:50.583
with Mr. Fish?

54:50.584 --> 54:52.151
I do not.

55:06.499 --> 55:08.667
Mr. Fish is in.

55:11.054 --> 55:12.771
(keypad beeping,
door buzzes and opens)

55:12.772 --> 55:14.573
You're not
going to give me

55:14.574 --> 55:16.208
a hard time, Amanda?

55:16.209 --> 55:17.910
You're on the list.

55:17.911 --> 55:19.211
What list is that?

55:19.212 --> 55:21.246
Mr. Fish is in.

55:21.247 --> 55:22.781
He's having breakfast.

55:33.025 --> 55:35.059
(low, rolling thunder)

55:35.060 --> 55:36.746
Thank you, Steven.

55:36.747 --> 55:38.982
I guess I'm
on the list.

55:38.983 --> 55:42.986
Amanda does have the names of
the people I don't mind seeing.

55:42.987 --> 55:44.120
I'm touched.

55:44.121 --> 55:45.522
Beautiful woman.

55:45.523 --> 55:46.957
Well, there are
certain advantages

55:46.958 --> 55:49.359
to having an attractive woman
as an assistant.

55:49.360 --> 55:50.860
Such as?

55:52.697 --> 55:55.565
Let's just leave it at that,
Jesse Stone.

55:55.566 --> 55:57.968
Do you miss Alan?

55:57.969 --> 56:01.938
I don't miss having a psychopath
in my outer office, no.

56:01.939 --> 56:04.040
Actually, he was a sociopath.

56:04.041 --> 56:05.976
Well, he's a dead sociopath.

56:05.977 --> 56:09.779
Some say he was hit by
that car intentionally.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.881
Can I tell you something,
Jesse Stone?

56:11.882 --> 56:13.183
You can.

56:13.184 --> 56:16.453
You're off your game.

56:16.454 --> 56:18.455
Your banter isn't up
to standard.

56:18.456 --> 56:20.824
You seem preoccupied.

56:20.825 --> 56:22.158
Do I?

56:22.159 --> 56:24.160
You're not wearing
your PPD hat.

56:24.161 --> 56:25.362
It's retired.

56:25.363 --> 56:27.797
As are you.

56:27.798 --> 56:31.835
You thinking about coming over
to the dark side, Jesse Stone?

56:31.836 --> 56:34.004
Not hardly.

56:34.872 --> 56:36.506
I lost a friend.

56:36.507 --> 56:38.475
Would you like some eggs?

56:38.476 --> 56:40.210
She was being treated

56:40.211 --> 56:42.912
for an alcohol issue
at a place called Tranquility.

56:42.913 --> 56:44.347
Rehab mill.

56:45.716 --> 56:47.584
I've heard it described as that.

56:47.585 --> 56:51.521
They graduated her on
prescription drugs,

56:51.522 --> 56:53.456
and within a year,
she was into

56:53.457 --> 56:54.858
smack and prostitution.

56:54.859 --> 56:56.026
How's that happen, Gino?

56:56.027 --> 56:57.761
You're asking me?

56:57.762 --> 56:59.996
I am. You have scruples
about prostitution.

56:59.997 --> 57:01.264
So do you.

57:01.265 --> 57:02.866
And you know something
about drugs.

57:02.867 --> 57:06.669
Hey, I am just
a boxing promoter.

57:06.670 --> 57:10.840
You're a significant contributor
to Sister Mary John's shelter.

57:10.841 --> 57:12.976
Now, that is private.

57:17.014 --> 57:19.082
You hear things.

57:19.083 --> 57:21.217
I hear a lot of things.

57:21.218 --> 57:24.621
And you know a lot about drugs.

57:26.190 --> 57:28.358
(sighs)

57:28.359 --> 57:30.460
If we are to remain friends,

57:30.461 --> 57:33.263
you'll have to allow me
my personal vanities

57:33.264 --> 57:35.632
and my double standards.

57:35.633 --> 57:38.068
It was nice seeing you,
Jesse Stone.

57:58.036 --> 57:59.120
HEALY:
Did you change your mind

57:59.129 --> 58:00.263
about picking up the check?

58:00.334 --> 58:01.801
Hey, I'm a pensioned retiree.

58:02.856 --> 58:04.690
If you say so.

58:04.709 --> 58:05.977
I don't think he did it.

58:05.978 --> 58:07.578
Jury didn't agree.

58:07.579 --> 58:08.980
Why don't you think he did it?

58:08.981 --> 58:10.648
I don't know.

58:10.649 --> 58:12.583
Seemed like a decent kid.

58:12.584 --> 58:14.285
So did Ted Bundy.

58:14.286 --> 58:16.387
If you don't like
the answers you're getting,

58:16.388 --> 58:17.455
check your premises.

58:17.456 --> 58:19.123
I think it's
right in our face

58:19.124 --> 58:20.091
and we can't see it.

58:20.092 --> 58:21.426
You proficient on that thing?

58:21.427 --> 58:22.460
Not hardly.

58:22.461 --> 58:23.461
Well, unless you want

58:23.462 --> 58:25.396
to call in one of
your college boys,

58:25.397 --> 58:26.564
check for unsolved crimes

58:26.565 --> 58:29.067
on the same date
in the same vicinity,

58:29.068 --> 58:31.636
about the same time
as the killing.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.642
I'm sure one of my highly
educated college graduates

58:37.643 --> 58:39.043
would have run this.

58:39.044 --> 58:40.645
Are you now?

58:41.480 --> 58:43.114
Okay.

58:43.115 --> 58:44.449
We got a rape three blocks away.

58:44.450 --> 58:46.084
What time was the killing?

58:48.320 --> 58:49.954
11:45.

58:49.955 --> 58:51.789
The rapist
approached the victim

58:51.790 --> 58:54.325
at 11:43.

58:54.326 --> 58:56.928
Well, unless the guy
is a two-minute wonder,

58:56.929 --> 58:58.296
we got a theory.

58:58.297 --> 58:59.530
We got more than that.

58:59.531 --> 59:01.265
We got the rapist's DNA.

59:01.266 --> 59:03.167
You got the perp's DNA?

59:03.168 --> 59:04.235
(sighs)

59:04.236 --> 59:05.470
Hold on a second.
(stammers)

59:05.471 --> 59:07.138
Give me a minute.
I-I got to have

59:07.139 --> 59:10.775
my fingers catch up
with my mind here.

59:10.776 --> 59:12.143
I'm checking my premises.

59:14.446 --> 59:15.847
(trilling, beeps)

59:15.848 --> 59:17.081
Couldn't match his DNA

59:17.082 --> 59:19.383
with anything
at the robbery scene,

59:19.384 --> 59:20.952
but we did get it.

59:20.953 --> 59:24.188
My sense is,
it'll match the rapist.

59:24.189 --> 59:26.691
Oh, I believe it will.

59:26.692 --> 59:29.060
So, why didn't you
call me with this?

59:29.061 --> 59:30.762
Why'd you come in?

59:30.763 --> 59:32.997
I just like you.

59:35.033 --> 59:36.834
Give me the badge.

59:38.070 --> 59:39.437
I got a call

59:39.438 --> 59:42.206
from a Dr. Parkinson
at a place called Tranquility.

59:42.207 --> 59:46.277
And a call
from Rutherford College.

59:46.278 --> 59:49.013
They were inquiring into
State Homicide's investigation

59:49.014 --> 59:52.083
into the death
of a Cynthia Van Aldan.

59:52.084 --> 59:53.317
Good for them.

59:53.318 --> 59:54.819
After Dr. Parkinson
suggested

59:54.820 --> 59:56.654
that you were impersonating
a police officer,

I assured him that

you <i>were</i> working

Did you also get a call
from the Paradise Police Chief?

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:06.264
I'm not going to tell you that.

We're not supposed to talk

he falsified his résumé.

Yeah, I-I-I think
that was the reason.

Was there another reason, Lewis?

01:02:29.283 --> 01:02:31.718
It might have had something
to do with the fact

01:02:31.719 --> 01:02:33.353
that he was busted for drugs.

01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:35.188

Please do not tell
Dr. Parkinson about this.

01:02:42.129 --> 01:02:43.763
What did Valery do here, Lewis?

01:02:43.764 --> 01:02:45.465
He was only an orderly,

01:02:45.466 --> 01:02:48.301

Almost two months ago.

Do you know he was busted
with Cindy Van Aldan?

01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:00.213
She was a former patient.

01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:02.048

Moscow Nights.

01:06:02.482 --> 01:06:04.150
- Ring a bell?
- No.

01:06:04.151 --> 01:06:05.751
Outcall massage.

01:06:05.752 --> 01:06:08.254
The missing part
of your puzzle

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:09.822
is Valery Siminov.

01:06:10.924 --> 01:06:12.975
Wetback pimp.

01:06:14.328 --> 01:06:16.162
You don't like this guy.

01:06:16.163 --> 01:06:18.231
What's not to dislike?

01:06:18.232 --> 01:06:21.834
These Russians--
they have no code.

01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:24.337
"I will bow to no man"--
that's not a code.

01:06:24.338 --> 01:06:25.738
Russian mob?

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:27.640
No, a freelance wannabe.

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:32.245
He recruits his girls
by working at rehab clinics.

01:06:32.246 --> 01:06:33.479
He's a predator.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.314
He knows their
profile, see?

01:06:35.315 --> 01:06:39.619
He romances them when they're
at their most vulnerable.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.888
What happened to your friend?

01:06:41.889 --> 01:06:43.422
She's dead.

01:06:43.423 --> 01:06:45.124
Overdosed on heroin.

01:06:45.959 --> 01:06:47.860
Tranquility put her
on antidepressants,

01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:49.195
pronounced her cured

01:06:49.196 --> 01:06:51.030
and forgot about her.

01:06:51.031 --> 01:06:52.899
So did I.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.200
Not your fault.

01:06:54.201 --> 01:06:57.370
When she stopped calling,
I could have found her.

01:07:00.324 --> 01:07:03.309
I think I know you, Jesse Stone.

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.477
Meaning?

01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:05.678
Meaning...

01:07:05.679 --> 01:07:07.847
you will have to do something
about your friend.

01:07:07.848 --> 01:07:10.816
These Russians
are bad guys.

01:07:10.817 --> 01:07:12.485
You need to be careful.

01:07:13.353 --> 01:07:14.854
The ugly truth of it, Gino,

01:07:14.855 --> 01:07:18.024
is, it doesn't matter
a whole hell of a lot to me.

01:07:21.595 --> 01:07:24.630
It was nice talking to you,
Jesse Stone.

01:07:29.303 --> 01:07:31.570
(sighs)

01:07:33.407 --> 01:07:35.608
(foghorn droning)

01:07:48.488 --> 01:07:50.690

01:08:51.984 --> 01:08:54.252

01:08:59.225 --> 01:09:00.943
Thanks, Laura.

01:09:00.944 --> 01:09:03.529
That's one.

01:09:08.135 --> 01:09:10.336
(touch-tone dialing)

01:09:14.307 --> 01:09:15.741
(phone line ringing)

01:09:15.742 --> 01:09:17.810
WOMAN (Russian accent):
Welcome to Moscow Nights,

01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:21.279
offering the complete
massage experience

01:09:21.281 --> 01:09:24.283
in the privacy
of your hotel room.

01:09:24.283 --> 01:09:25.718
Would you like to speak

01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:28.720
to one of our beautiful
Russian therapists?

01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:31.323
CINDY (echoing):
<i>Jesse...</i>

01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:34.693
<i>Jesse... I'm sorry.</i>

01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:38.197
<i>You're my best friend.</i>

01:09:38.198 --> 01:09:41.332
<i>I need to talk.</i>

01:09:41.334 --> 01:09:46.238
<i>I tried to call you,</i>
<i>but your phone is disconnected.</i>

01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:48.941
<i>I'm coming back to Paradise.</i>

01:10:04.391 --> 01:10:06.592
(birds squawking in distance)

01:10:11.465 --> 01:10:13.632
(grunts)

01:10:15.018 --> 01:10:17.186
(sighs)

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.578
(sighing)

01:10:25.579 --> 01:10:28.781
What are you looking at?

01:10:29.983 --> 01:10:31.484
(grunts)

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.425
(overlapping chatter)

01:10:39.426 --> 01:10:40.910
You called me?

01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:43.095
HEALY: We'll talk
about this later.

01:10:48.868 --> 01:10:50.886
The DNA's a match.

01:10:50.887 --> 01:10:53.339
Your perp's not the perp.

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.341
But he is a rapist.
So the judge declares

01:10:55.342 --> 01:10:57.610
a mistrial, and you arrest him
for the rape.

01:10:57.611 --> 01:10:58.878
That's correct.

01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:02.097
I'd like to be a fly on
the wall for that one.

01:11:02.098 --> 01:11:04.083
You could've told me
this on the phone.

01:11:06.886 --> 01:11:09.722
You close to,
uh, Cynthia Van Aldan?

01:11:09.723 --> 01:11:11.090
I was.

01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:14.059
Got any evidence of foul play?

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.561
I do not.

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:19.732
If you get anything,
I'll go after it.

01:11:22.068 --> 01:11:23.802
Don't do this on your own.

01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:28.240
Jesse...

01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:30.743
thanks for this.

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:47.459
You are Mr. Stone.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.894
Jesse.

01:11:48.895 --> 01:11:50.062
Come in.

01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:52.932
Please.

01:12:03.243 --> 01:12:04.410
(speaking Russian)

01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:06.078
You speak Russian?

01:12:06.079 --> 01:12:07.246
I was talking to her.

01:12:07.247 --> 01:12:08.714
What's your name?

01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:10.249
Svetlana.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:13.052
Is she Russian or not?

01:12:13.053 --> 01:12:15.354
I'm paying
for a Russian.

01:12:15.355 --> 01:12:16.789
No, she is not Russian,

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:20.559
but she is young
and beautiful, is she not?

01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:25.064
Are you a cop?

01:12:25.065 --> 01:12:26.665
Why would you ask?

01:12:26.666 --> 01:12:28.734
If I ask, you have to tell me.

01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:30.169
Otherwise, it's
entrapment.

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:33.672
No, I'm not a cop.

01:12:33.673 --> 01:12:35.107
Good.

01:12:35.108 --> 01:12:36.308
You, of course,
have to pay in advance.

01:12:36.309 --> 01:12:37.476
Then I will leave.

01:12:37.477 --> 01:12:40.112
You're not gonna
stay and watch.

01:12:40.113 --> 01:12:43.349
After you pay,
I will leave.

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.683
Actually, I was a cop.

01:12:44.684 --> 01:12:47.052
A small town police chief,
but I got into a little trouble,

01:12:47.053 --> 01:12:48.721
and I had to retire early.

01:12:48.722 --> 01:12:50.789
(grunts and groans)

01:12:57.597 --> 01:12:58.931
Come on.

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:06.238
What's your real name?

01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:07.473
Emily.

01:13:07.474 --> 01:13:08.641
You have family, Emily?

01:13:08.642 --> 01:13:09.942
Yes.

01:13:09.943 --> 01:13:12.778
If you need to talk
to someone, call me.

01:13:14.648 --> 01:13:17.216
Go home.

01:13:23.323 --> 01:13:25.724
Please go home, Emily.

01:13:47.847 --> 01:13:49.682
You a tough guy?

01:13:49.683 --> 01:13:54.019
I'm tough enough.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.554
Cindy Van Aldan.

01:13:55.555 --> 01:13:56.939
Horrible tragedy.

01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.425
I didn't kill her.

01:13:59.426 --> 01:14:01.727
You might as well have.

01:14:03.196 --> 01:14:05.097
"I bow to no man."
What's that about?

01:14:05.098 --> 01:14:08.667
If your friends
could see you now.

01:14:09.502 --> 01:14:13.272
You prey on kids.

01:14:15.108 --> 01:14:17.009
You're thinking
about shooting me.

01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:18.444
I am.

01:14:18.445 --> 01:14:19.745
You can't kill me.

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:21.080
Why can't I kill you?

01:14:21.081 --> 01:14:22.314
The hotel has your name.

01:14:22.315 --> 01:14:25.250
Actually, I registered
under an assumed name.

01:14:25.251 --> 01:14:26.919
Valery Siminov.

01:14:28.488 --> 01:14:30.656
I paid cash.

01:14:35.645 --> 01:14:37.329
You need to retire, Valery.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:40.399
That's not in my plan.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.836
Okay.

01:14:45.472 --> 01:14:47.339
So shoot me.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.476
I've been thinking about that.

01:14:50.477 --> 01:14:52.878
Oh, this?

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:54.980
Just kidding.

01:14:56.983 --> 01:15:00.519
Do you hunt, Valery?

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.488
No, I think it's cruel.

01:15:02.489 --> 01:15:05.391
Oh. Well, here's
what I was thinking.

01:15:05.392 --> 01:15:08.127
When you shoot a big animal
like a deer or an elk

01:15:08.128 --> 01:15:10.195
with a high powered rifle,

01:15:10.196 --> 01:15:12.064
you can shoot him
right through the heart,

01:15:12.065 --> 01:15:16.101
and he still might run off,
sometimes for quite a distance.

01:15:16.102 --> 01:15:20.172
The animal's already dead,
he just doesn't know it yet.

01:15:20.173 --> 01:15:23.175
It's a good thing
animals can't think.

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.212
Now, people...

01:15:27.213 --> 01:15:30.249
People can think.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:33.719
I'm going to haunt you, Valery.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.022
You won't know
when it's gonna happen,

01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:42.961
but when it does,
you'll have time to think.

01:15:46.099 --> 01:15:49.334
You need to consider
retirement, Valery.

01:15:49.335 --> 01:15:50.869
I'm enjoying the hell out of it.

01:15:52.772 --> 01:15:54.940
Oh, and when you work
your way out of all that,

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:58.844
one piece of advice
for your own good:

01:15:58.845 --> 01:16:01.980
Stay away from the mini-bar.

01:16:09.345 --> 01:16:10.945
The judge declared
a mistrial.

01:16:11.713 --> 01:16:12.980
How'd you do it?

01:16:12.981 --> 01:16:14.915
Well, I just stayed at it.

01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:16.584
You saved my life.

01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:18.586
They said they'd make a formal
announcement later on today.

01:16:18.587 --> 01:16:20.054
Then I can get out of here.

01:16:20.055 --> 01:16:21.655
I don't know why not.

01:16:22.815 --> 01:16:24.266
Charles Morris?

01:16:24.267 --> 01:16:25.217
Am I free to go?

01:16:25.296 --> 01:16:26.380
You're under arrest for rape

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:28.491
and assault perpetrated
on Mrs. Jane Francis

01:16:28.492 --> 01:16:30.493
on February 4.

01:16:30.494 --> 01:16:31.761
You have the right
to remain silent

01:16:31.762 --> 01:16:33.346
and refuse to answer questions.

01:16:33.347 --> 01:16:34.915
- Do you understand?
- He does.

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:36.540
Anything you say
may be used against you

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:38.046
in a court of law.
Do you understand?

01:16:38.046 --> 01:16:39.260
- He does.
- You have the right

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.329
to consult an attorney before
speaking to the police...

01:16:41.329 --> 01:16:42.696
Cracker Jack?

01:16:42.697 --> 01:16:44.631
I got good and plenty.

01:16:44.632 --> 01:16:46.233
If you decide to answer
questions now

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.235
without a lawyer present,
Thanks for this.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:49.970
you have the right to stop
questioning at any time

01:16:49.971 --> 01:16:51.905
until you talk to a lawyer.
Do you understand what I...

01:16:51.906 --> 01:16:53.507
Yes, he understands.

01:17:09.913 --> 01:17:12.148
I feel he has
issues, Jesse.

01:17:15.586 --> 01:17:17.553
We both do.

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:18.721
You took off early.

01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:21.691
I did.

01:17:21.692 --> 01:17:23.659
Where's your Cruiser?

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.596
At the station.

01:17:26.597 --> 01:17:29.665
What'd you need
to talk about?

01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:31.667
Did Cindy commit suicide?

01:17:31.668 --> 01:17:33.603
I don't think so.

01:17:33.604 --> 01:17:34.971
But we don't know.

01:17:34.972 --> 01:17:37.040
No, we don't.

01:17:37.381 --> 01:17:39.315
He won't let me go
after it, Jesse.

01:17:39.316 --> 01:17:41.450
I would expect
no less of him.

01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:43.519
I want an answer.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.422
I know you want an answer.

01:17:46.423 --> 01:17:48.624
I may not find one.

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:52.305
I see it as my job not
to look the other way.

01:17:52.353 --> 01:17:55.655
You quit, didn't you?

01:17:55.656 --> 01:17:57.958
Numbness of the heart.

01:17:57.959 --> 01:18:00.493
You do this for me?

01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:03.630
For myself.

01:18:03.631 --> 01:18:06.466
You sure about that?

01:18:06.467 --> 01:18:09.436
I don't belong there anymore.

01:18:09.437 --> 01:18:12.055
I feel it in my cells.

01:18:12.056 --> 01:18:14.107
Does Rose know?

01:18:14.108 --> 01:18:15.876
She understands.

01:18:15.877 --> 01:18:19.079
She said she can't
afford not to stay.

01:18:19.981 --> 01:18:21.915
You're a good cop, Suit.

01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:23.984
You can hang your hat on that.

01:18:26.954 --> 01:18:28.956
You going
after Tranquility?

01:18:28.962 --> 01:18:29.962
No.

01:18:29.962 --> 01:18:32.964
They didn't help her,
but they didn't kill her.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:37.228
My sense is, you're going
after somebody, Jesse.

01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:39.430
I want to help.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:44.435
I'm not after anybody, Suitcase.

01:18:49.007 --> 01:18:51.575
There are no place out there
for graft,

01:18:51.576 --> 01:18:53.510
or greed or lies,

01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:56.413
or compromise
with human liberties.

01:18:56.414 --> 01:18:58.449
And if that's what
the grown-ups have done

01:18:58.450 --> 01:19:00.551
with this world
that was given to them,

01:19:00.552 --> 01:19:02.486
then we'd better get those
boys' camps started fast

01:19:02.487 --> 01:19:04.989
and see what the kids can do.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.907
And it's not too late,

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:10.461
because this country is
bigger than the Taylors,

01:19:10.462 --> 01:19:12.913
or you, or me, or anything else.

01:19:14.466 --> 01:19:17.468
Great principles don't get lost
once they come to light.

01:19:17.469 --> 01:19:19.470
They're right here.

01:19:19.471 --> 01:19:22.139
You just have to see them again!

01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:49.133
(keypad beeping,
door buzzes and opens)

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:54.738

01:20:37.048 --> 01:20:39.083

I guess this is just another
lost cause, Mr. Paine.

01:21:22.927 --> 01:21:27.364
All you people don't know
about lost causes.

01:21:27.365 --> 01:21:29.533
Mr. Paine does.

01:21:31.335 --> 01:21:32.803
He said once

01:21:32.804 --> 01:21:35.372
they were the only causes
worth fighting for.

01:21:35.373 --> 01:21:37.341
This is Jesse. Leave a message.

01:21:37.342 --> 01:21:39.476
