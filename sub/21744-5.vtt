<i>Back to you, Bob.</i>

00:37.538 --> 00:38.872
What the hell is this shit?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.917
Crime is the lowest it's been in years.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.086
The number of 911 calls have gone down.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.964
There's all sorts of goddamn
holes in your stories.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.133
And how is it that you're always
the first one on the scene?

00:50.676 --> 00:52.261
I'm not revealing my sources.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.972
My sources are telling me
that you're full of shit.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.015
I talked to the chief of police.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.518
He says it's way too early to use
the words "serial killer."

00:59.601 --> 01:01.895
Make us look like we don't know
what the fuck we're doing.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.147
When do we work for the cops?

01:04.815 --> 01:06.316
The public deserves to know the truth.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.610
You're scaring the shit out of people.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.362
Stop editorializing.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.489
Stop reporting fake news.

01:12.573 --> 01:16.243
And stop giving airtime to that nutjob
who's running for city council.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.662
Nobody gives a shit
about the zoning board.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.499
The world isn't all about
butterflies and puppy adoptions.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.795
People would know that if you aired
the tape of what happened to Serena.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.797
That's not news. That's sensationalism.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.342
You sure there isn't another reason
you're sitting on the tape, Bob?

01:33.302 --> 01:35.721
Well, her parents are suing us
because we didn't protect her,

01:35.804 --> 01:38.307
but they don't need a visual.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.893
Not to mention you were fucking
their dumb-as-shit baby girl.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.271
You shut your goddamn mouth, Beverly.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.317
In fact, screw it.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.402
You're fired.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.488
You sure you want to do that, Bob?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.575
You sure you want to force me
to call a press conference

01:56.658 --> 02:00.829
and talk about the many times I saw you
sexually harassing the dead girl?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.544
Get the fuck out of my office.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.672
Have a nice day, Bob.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.346
There's no official polling
for the city council race,

02:17.429 --> 02:20.557
so Kai asked me to do my own
unscientific poll around town.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.560
Needless to say,
voter awareness is pretty low.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.647
Most people don't know about the special
election or who is running

02:26.730 --> 02:29.233
or what the city council even does.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.777
Why are we even trying to win
some stupid election?

02:31.860 --> 02:34.071
Who cares if Kai's on city council?

02:37.115 --> 02:38.659
Because the perception of credibility

02:38.742 --> 02:40.702
leads to the perception of power.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.330
Because people
don't follow experts anymore,

02:43.413 --> 02:44.498
they follow titles.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.794
And when we get our shit together,
and cause enough panic and fear,

02:48.877 --> 02:51.213
the sheep are gonna turn to their leaders
to save them.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.008
And because city council
is the only goddamn election available,

02:56.635 --> 03:00.180
that leader is gonna have to be
a goddamn city councilman.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.309
HARRISON: People aren't scared enough.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.979
You'd think a serial killer
leaving smiley faces everywhere

03:07.062 --> 03:10.023
would make people crap their drawers,
but it's pretty much business as usual.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.650
We need to make the murders scarier.

03:12.776 --> 03:16.905
Throw in some satanic stuff like that
movie <i>Paradise Lost</i> I saw on HBO once.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.407
BEVERLY: It doesn't matter
if the devil himself

03:18.490 --> 03:21.952
rises up from hell and starts
killing people around here

03:22.327 --> 03:24.746
as long as no one sees him do it.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.457
The world isn't "tell me," it's "show me."

03:27.833 --> 03:31.420
People aren't scared because they haven't
seen the goddamn clowns.

03:31.503 --> 03:35.340
We are pulling off the cinematic
<i>Clockwork Orange </i>shit,

03:35.424 --> 03:37.885
and it's like we're putting on
a show for ourselves.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.888
You're the one who couldn't get your boss
to air the Serena tape.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.099
That was a work of art, man.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.392
He'll never air it.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.314
And he's beginning to catch on
that my impartiality as a reporter

03:51.732 --> 03:52.983
might be compromised.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.362
Well…

03:57.863 --> 03:59.698
Then I guess we're just
gonna have to kill Bob.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.160
In the most horrible,

04:03.285 --> 04:05.495
-satanic way possible.

You're late.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.045

-That's never happened before.
-No.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.810
I've always been afraid of…

06:35.896 --> 06:37.147
…the holes.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.942
But this time…

06:40.984 --> 06:42.694
…the holes were on my skin, and…

06:42.778 --> 06:44.404
This isn't a surprise to me.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.283
Your trypophobia isn't simply
a biological revulsion.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.536
It's deeply rooted in your subconscious.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.040
You're afraid of falling into
the darkness of your life.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.627
Metaphorically, the holes were created
by everything that's happened.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.421
Ally, you've been through a lot.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.132
Oh… God.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.052
When Ivy took Oz…

07:09.096 --> 07:10.681
I thought it would be hard.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.060
But it's been unbearable.

07:15.811 --> 07:19.940
I realized I have a biological need
to see my son.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.368
It was another hole I couldn't fill.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.706
And I'm heartbroken.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.584
And angry.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.170
And not just at her, but at me.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.298
For letting this happen.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.760
For…

07:49.928 --> 07:51.430
…being tempted.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.226
I'm so glad to hear you say that.
You're taking some responsibility.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.854
That is the first step
to conquering any fear,

07:58.937 --> 08:00.981
because it's up to you
to pull yourself out.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.650
Yeah, well,
she's clearly not gonna help me.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.364
She's made it so I have to stay
in that house alone.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.783
By myself.

08:14.036 --> 08:17.581
A house that was marked
by a serial killer.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.543
They told me that
I would have police protection.

08:22.669 --> 08:26.423
I have seen one police car
drive by in three days.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.634
Is there any way
that you can stay in a hotel?

08:32.095 --> 08:33.597
Ivy canceled all the credit cards.

08:34.973 --> 08:37.100
Everything I have
is tied up in the restaurant.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.770
I own the building,
which means I'm strapped for cash

08:39.937 --> 08:41.355
until I sell.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.192
I mean, I have enough to live. Barely.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.241
It was like she prepared.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.955
She closed down everything…

08:59.331 --> 09:00.666
…so fast.

09:01.250 --> 09:05.170
Did you have any idea that your
relationship with Ivy might be tenuous?

I know you've been working hard.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.030
Yeah, we…

09:32.114 --> 09:33.824
-We had three cancellations tonight.
-Mmm.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.327
On a slow night, that's the profit margin.
Do you know that? Three tables.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.582

into a hole, financially.

(SCOFFS) What were you thinking?

10:08.233 --> 10:10.819
Uh, I was thinking
that we might have fun.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.490
Like a happy, loving couple.
I was thinking that you might give a shit.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.914
ALLY: <i>I thought</i>
<i>it was because of the election.</i>

10:21.997 --> 10:23.749
<i>But now I don't know.</i>

10:24.625 --> 10:27.336
Every little piece of my life
has fallen apart.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.338
Can I make a suggestion?

10:29.713 --> 10:33.342
You can only work on things
that you are personally in control of.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.761
Ivy's out of the question.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.181
What can we do that will help you today?

10:40.766 --> 10:45.020
ALLY: <i>Ivy convinced a judge to allow</i>
<i>only supervised visits with Oz.</i>

10:45.103 --> 10:48.649

<i>I didn't even know how to act naturally.</i>

10:48.732 --> 10:50.317
You know what, I almost forgot.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.528
I brought you something from home.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.866
So you aren't stuck scribbling your
masterpieces on hotel napkins.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.201
Thanks.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.082
Do you have any favorite things
you like drawing these days?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.000
I don't know.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.630
Ooh, I know.
You used to be obsessed with pirates.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.756
Maybe you can draw me one.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.508
(EXHALES)

11:15.759 --> 11:18.470
I remember when you were little,

11:19.054 --> 11:20.973

11:21.265 --> 11:22.391
Do you remember?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.643
And I'd chase you around the house,

11:25.769 --> 11:28.355
and you'd wave your plastic sword
at me and I'd be like,

11:28.438 --> 11:32.025
"Aye, aye, Captain Ozymandias,
"who shall walk the plank today?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.277
"Argh."

11:34.528 --> 11:35.696

11:36.196 --> 11:37.239
you're being weird.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.158
I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)

11:43.996 --> 11:46.582
(CRYING) I need you
to help me not lose my son.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.505
-Did you eat?
-OZ: (OVER PHONE) <i>Yeah, we had pizza.</i>

11:53.589 --> 11:56.508
<i>Is it okay if I watch</i> Guardians
of the Galaxy <i>with Jeremy?</i>

11:56.758 --> 11:57.926
<i>There's some cussing.</i>

11:58.010 --> 11:59.261
What does Jeremy's mom say?

11:59.845 --> 12:01.180
<i>She says, "Fine."</i>

12:01.263 --> 12:03.432
Okay. Don't stay up too late.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.517
And you listen to what Jeremy's mom says.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.019
And I will see you tomorrow.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.353
I love you.

12:10.439 --> 12:11.481
WINTER: So, he seems okay.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.611
(CHUCKLES) He gets to sleep over
at Jeremy's house on a school night.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.946
And he loves being at the motel.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.698
Vending machines.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.534
No, Oz is great.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.078
Has he asked about Ally?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.541
In a way.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.503
He wanted to know if you were
gonna be his third mom.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.924
I'm sorry he had to be the one
to find the video, Ivy,

12:37.007 --> 12:38.258
but it had to be that way.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.677
I get how this works,

12:41.386 --> 12:43.847
what needs to be done,
and I've been doing it, haven't I?

12:45.015 --> 12:48.268
It's just things are about
to get really real.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.355
This isn't knitting a pink pussy hat
and marching with a clever sign.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.941
This is radical action.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.860
Radicals are the only people
who've ever gotten anything done.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.862
I'm ready.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.240
I hate this country.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.866
What it's become.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.328
I hate my fucking wife
for letting it happen.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.206
The only thing I love right now is my son,

13:09.289 --> 13:10.707
and I will do whatever it takes

13:10.791 --> 13:12.459
to make the world a better place for him,

13:12.751 --> 13:14.837
even if it means burning it all down.

13:15.921 --> 13:16.964
Good.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.343
Then you'll do great.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.654
everybody chant <i>"Ave Satanas."</i>

13:41.697 --> 13:44.283
Wouldn't it be better if we said
"Hail Satan" in English?

13:44.366 --> 13:45.826
So that people understand.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.454
Not that I ever feel the need
to explain myself,

13:49.538 --> 13:50.914
but it's about spreading terror.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.500
Latin is inherently scary.

13:54.710 --> 13:55.836
