00:01.380 --> 00:02.290
Hello, Jerry.

00:02.300 --> 00:03.800
Lorraine! Hello!

00:06.900 --> 00:08.860
That was mistletoe!

00:09.830 --> 00:14.410
United States Coast Guard auxiliary are
a volunteered component of the coast guard,
no age limit.

00:14.450 --> 00:15.050
Guns?

00:15.060 --> 00:17.100
–Probably depth charges, denny.
–Let's go.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.270
Where are they off to?

00:18.310 --> 00:20.520
They've gone to join the Coast Guard.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.980
Happens at a lot of firms.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.010
We don't behave ourselves, we'll
never pass the background check.

00:25.050 --> 00:26.100
We'll get in.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.070
Oh, we're gonna be in the military.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.520
Already my penis feels bigger.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.510
–I'm sorry, sir, but you can't—
–Denny Crane, United States Coast Guard.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.530
Sir!

01:16.540 --> 01:17.810
Denny Crane coming through.

01:17.850 --> 01:19.190
Denny Crane, Coast Guard.

01:19.230 --> 01:20.730
Denny Crane.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.840
Walt…

01:28.850 --> 01:30.700
Oh, my God.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.220
Never liked him.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.360
What the hell are you doing?

01:35.400 --> 01:36.410
Denny Crane.

01:36.420 --> 01:38.790
I don't care who you are. You're
contaminating a crime scene.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.250
Penelope.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.180
Denny. Oh, my God, Denny.

01:44.150 --> 01:45.560
Oh, Penelope.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.150
What happened?

01:47.160 --> 01:49.020
I killed him, Denny.

01:49.030 --> 01:50.050
That was off the record.

01:50.090 --> 01:53.984
This woman is represented by
the United States Coast Guard.

01:54.570 --> 01:55.150
What happened?

01:55.190 --> 01:57.540
–We were gardening.
–In January?

01:57.550 --> 02:00.430
Well, we were just organizing where
the vegetables and the plants would go.

02:00.470 --> 02:02.900
We were talking, and then suddenly…

02:03.190 --> 02:04.840
Denny, I don't know what happened, okay?

02:04.880 --> 02:08.169
I just saw this shovel hurtling through
the air in the direction of his head,

02:08.210 --> 02:14.170
and it— it struck him, and then I
realized that the handle was in my hands.

02:14.180 --> 02:17.230
I had swung the shovel.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.180
Oh, my God. I killed my husband.

02:21.770 --> 02:24.080
Are the police gonna arrest me?

02:24.090 --> 02:25.420
Well, how much did you tell 'em?

02:25.460 --> 02:26.270
Everything.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.710
They're gonna arrest you.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.020
–Oh, my God.
–Oh, no, no. No, no.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.470
No, no, it's all right, Penelope.

02:31.510 --> 02:33.150
It's all right. It's okay.

02:33.190 --> 02:34.420
I'll defend you.

02:34.430 --> 02:36.150
I'll get you acquitted.
I'll be relevant again.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.640
We'll have dinner. It's all good.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.160
This is the way to ring in
the new year.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.360
Denny Crane.

02:44.910 --> 02:46.800
Ready for my close-up.

Mad About You

03:17.590 --> 03:19.080
<i>They were out shoveling snow.</i>

03:19.120 --> 03:21.520
<i>And her shovel
accidentally hit his head.</i>

03:21.560 --> 03:22.940
<i>It happens. He died.</i>

03:22.980 --> 03:24.710
<i>Those are the risks of winter.</i>

03:24.750 --> 03:26.310
<i>You know, here we are in the wintertime.</i>

03:26.350 --> 03:30.970
<i>Winter is the cruelest month or series
of months, and how many people must die…</i>

03:31.010 --> 03:32.940
The arraignment's this morning.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.880
I've always wanted this woman, Alan.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.100
To think she's been delivered
to me via her dead husband…

03:38.140 --> 03:40.920
You think it's wise to be giving
accounts to the press, Denny?

03:40.960 --> 03:41.830
<i>Snowballs?</i>

03:41.870 --> 03:46.010
<i>The man slipped on the ice, fell, hit
his head, died. It happens.</i>

03:46.050 --> 03:47.590
<i>It's winter, man.</i>

03:47.630 --> 03:50.410
<i>He went out to get the morning
paper, a big icicle falls off the roof.</i>

03:50.450 --> 03:52.190
<i>He died. It happens.</i>

03:52.230 --> 03:53.480
<i>He was acting depressed…</i>

03:53.520 --> 03:56.130
<i>but who could predict he'd
take his own life with a shovel?</i>

03:56.170 --> 03:57.940
Denny, this is crazy.

03:57.950 --> 03:58.860
That's it exactly.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.510
That's our defense—
temporary insanity.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.330
You can't plead your insanity.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.570
You are nuts.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.630
That's the beauty.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.880
–The arraignment is when?
–10:00.

04:08.890 --> 04:10.200
I'll go with you.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.840
No, you won't.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.060
This is my case. I'll handle it.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.560
Well, certainly I can second chair.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.529
No.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.779
I don't want your help.
I don't even want you there.

04:18.820 --> 04:19.399
Why not?

04:19.410 --> 04:21.670
Because I don't.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.470
Well, I let you second chair my cases.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.080
You let me sit and watch.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.890
No, I— I'm— I'm
gonna do this myself.

04:26.930 --> 04:30.790
I'll get one of the babies to help me, somebody
who knows their place as a subordinate.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.620
I don't want you
anywhere near this case.

04:33.630 --> 04:35.600
Denny, it's a murder trial.

04:35.610 --> 04:38.170
Thanks. With that tip,
I should be fine.

04:38.210 --> 04:42.330
From here on, I'm flying solo.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.600
Oh, my.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.510
It's very embarrassing.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.560
It's very embarrassing.

05:03.660 --> 05:06.240
Um, why don't you begin by
telling us what's happened?

05:06.280 --> 05:07.630
Okay.

05:09.270 --> 05:13.850
What's happened is, my
husband of 20 years left me.

05:13.860 --> 05:18.216
As you might expect, this wreaked
considerable havoc with my life.

05:18.890 --> 05:24.810
I would like to sue his lawyers because
I believe they caused him to leave me.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.400
Okay, how did they accomplish that?

05:27.440 --> 05:29.150
Well…

05:29.160 --> 05:33.080
he's represented by Bingham, Hooley
and Knapp, that putrid, soulless,

05:33.120 --> 05:35.340
disgusting firm with the
billboards all over town.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.620
Surely you've seen them.

05:36.660 --> 05:41.820
Um,“Is life passing you by?
Is divorce right for you?”

05:41.830 --> 05:45.600
Well, my husband was exposed to
these disgusting, indecent billboards,

05:45.640 --> 05:49.760
and as a result, he decided,
hmm, divorce was right for him.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.370
I…

05:51.380 --> 05:53.710
I want to… get them.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.060
Okay.

05:55.070 --> 05:57.000
Well, uh, let's see.

06:04.430 --> 06:10.090
<i>Every so often, on rare occasions,
an aneurysm can make the head
literally explode, causing bleeding.</i>

06:10.130 --> 06:14.670
<i>My client simply had a shovel
on hand to bury her husband.</i>

06:14.680 --> 06:16.610
<i>They're jewish.</i>

06:17.190 --> 06:18.360
<i>Yeah, I don't know about you, but…</i>

06:18.400 --> 06:19.340
You summoned?

06:19.350 --> 06:22.690
Oh, um, um, Whitney, right?

06:22.700 --> 06:23.930
I need a second chair. You're it.

06:23.970 --> 06:25.130
Don't try and take over.

06:25.170 --> 06:25.840
Do as I tell you.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.900
Just sit back and learn.

06:27.910 --> 06:29.900
Arraignment's in 40 minutes.

06:29.910 --> 06:30.830
Denny.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.410
Well, these are exciting times.

06:33.420 --> 06:34.620
Don't wanna be checked on.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.090
I just came to wish you good luck.

06:36.130 --> 06:36.890
Good. Fine.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.300
Job well done. Feel lucky. Bye.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.300
Bye.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.910
We simply tell her we can't
take the case. That's all.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.100
I don't think that's an option, Jerry.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.670
Shirley assigned us to it.
She must want us to do it.

06:53.710 --> 06:54.890
Do what?

06:54.900 --> 06:56.390
Lorraine. Hello. Welcome.

06:56.430 --> 06:58.300
New year going well? Hello.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.750
Hello.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.990
New year's going very well.
Thank you.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.680
Lips!

07:04.370 --> 07:05.330
I'm sorry?

07:05.340 --> 07:07.610
I beg your pardon.

07:07.620 --> 07:10.980
I'll issue a formal apology in writing.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.060
That's okay.

07:12.070 --> 07:14.620
Maybe you were just remembering
our kiss at the Christmas party.

07:14.660 --> 07:17.160
It was delightful. Wasn't it?

07:34.560 --> 07:38.190
32116, Commonwealth
vs Penelope Kimball

07:38.200 --> 07:40.790
on the charge of murder
in the first degree.

07:40.830 --> 07:44.750
Denny Crane representing
the defendant. We waive…

07:44.760 --> 07:47.920
good-bye, enter a plea of not
guilty due to temporary insanity,

07:47.960 --> 07:52.470
ask at this time for a
change of venue to L.A.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.520
Los Angeles?

07:53.530 --> 07:54.390
It's cold here.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.390
We can go in my jet.

07:55.430 --> 07:58.890
Mr Crane, I would need a
legal basis for a venue change.

07:58.930 --> 07:59.920
Of course.

07:59.930 --> 08:03.030
My client was caught with a shovel
in her hand, standing over a dead body.

08:03.070 --> 08:05.410
My legal basis is Phil Spector.

08:05.420 --> 08:06.870
They don't convict in L.A.

08:06.910 --> 08:08.620
Denied. Let's set a date.

08:08.630 --> 08:09.300
Friday night.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.050
I'll bring the condoms.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.460
You, me and one of the jurors.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.170
Denny Crane. Thank you.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.900
CDs in the lobby.

08:16.910 --> 08:18.510
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

08:18.550 --> 08:19.680
They love me, judge.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.870
As do you. I can see it.

08:20.910 --> 08:23.560
Step up, Mr Crane.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.300
This is my courtroom.

08:28.310 --> 08:29.430
Strict.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.880
And this is a murder trial.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.080
I will not be putting
up with this behavior.

08:33.120 --> 08:33.950
Do you understand me?

08:33.990 --> 08:35.330
I do, I do.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.070
When will you be ready for trial?

08:37.110 --> 08:38.100
I'm ready now.

08:38.110 --> 08:38.900
Excuse me?

08:38.909 --> 08:40.120
Facts are simple, so am I.

08:40.159 --> 08:43.929
Let's get this baby tried
before I forget what it's about.

08:43.970 --> 08:44.660
Fine.

08:44.670 --> 08:45.550
Are you serious?

08:45.590 --> 08:49.520
Like he said, the facts
are simple. Let's do it.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.320
Okay.

08:52.330 --> 08:55.036
We'll do <i>voir dire</i> this afternoon.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.000
Trial starts tomorrow.

08:57.010 --> 08:59.560
You are hot.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.340
Chambers?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.760
The marriage was over.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.430
We both kinda knew that.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.030
But?

09:19.040 --> 09:22.560
But the decision to
actually separate, well,

09:22.930 --> 09:25.750
obviously for me
to just kind of snap,

09:25.760 --> 09:28.750
I must have been very angry.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.200
Well, we don't say “angry” in court.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.520
We say “mad.”

09:35.630 --> 09:38.220
I didn't plan to hit him.

09:38.230 --> 09:40.030
I swear, Denny.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.910
I believe you.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.480
You're not a violent person.

09:45.490 --> 09:47.450
You're very tender.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.804
You've been lonely a long
time, haven't you, Penelope?

09:55.060 --> 09:57.100
Yes.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.660
Denny…

10:00.010 --> 10:03.910
he would never even touch me.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.970
That's hard to believe.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.960
You're such a beautiful woman.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.830
He didn't make me feel that way.

10:13.620 --> 10:16.020
That was wrong.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.850
It's okay to cry, Penny.

10:19.860 --> 10:23.170
But not in the courtroom.
I don't want any self-pity.

10:23.210 --> 10:26.300
You need to be strong in there.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.250
Okay.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.420
What can we do…

10:31.470 --> 10:34.450
to make you feel stronger?

10:40.980 --> 10:43.310
All we can really do is meet
with her husband and his attorney

10:43.350 --> 10:47.600
and effect some kind of
satisfactory settlement.

10:48.840 --> 10:49.890
Jerry?

10:50.700 --> 10:53.710
Yes, that's— that
would be good.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.440
What are you thinking about?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.160
Nothing.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.590
Jerry?

11:01.950 --> 11:06.520
I was thinking about my
blurting out “lips” to Lorraine.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.660
I was thinking about how I blurt
things out, kick my leg, purr,

11:11.670 --> 11:14.550
make funny sounds with my mouth.

11:15.850 --> 11:17.340
A neurologist once told me

11:17.380 --> 11:22.660
I might have a mild case
of Tourette's syndrome.

11:22.670 --> 11:24.090
Can you imagine?

11:24.100 --> 11:28.850
Having Asperger's and Tourette's?

11:29.950 --> 11:32.450
We all have something, don't we?

11:34.380 --> 11:36.950
I feel so…

11:36.960 --> 11:38.850
I don't know…

11:40.220 --> 11:42.700
undignified sometimes.

11:42.710 --> 11:46.850
Jerry, hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of people have tourette's.

11:46.890 --> 11:49.650
There's nothing undignified about it.

11:49.660 --> 11:54.260
Personally, I find your
various tics quite endearing.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.200
You know, Katie…

11:59.530 --> 12:02.720
you really are a special person.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.940
Kidding.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.370
I heard the arraignment went…

12:22.880 --> 12:24.020
well.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.990
I'm meeting with a client.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.220
She was weak, Alan, vulnerable.

12:29.230 --> 12:32.010
She needed to bone up
on the trial. So I just—

12:32.050 --> 12:33.870
This is a first-degree murder trial.

12:33.910 --> 12:35.290
I know that.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.520
Are you even remotely prepared?

12:37.560 --> 12:38.450
Of course I am.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.320
Denny—

12:39.330 --> 12:41.680
Now don't start.

12:43.960 --> 12:48.460
I know what you're doing with these
silly sound bites, be it on suicide…

12:48.500 --> 12:49.000
He was sad.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.350
…fallen icicles…

12:50.360 --> 12:51.380
It's dead of winter, man.

12:51.420 --> 12:52.950
–…the coast guard…
–We're practically in.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.170
…propositioning the judge.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.480
–She's so hot.
–Stop it.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.080
You're trying to have the first laugh
on yourself so when others snicker,

13:00.120 --> 13:04.480
as they no doubt will, you can pretend
they're laughing with you instead of at you.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.430
But they will be laughing
at you, Denny.

13:07.720 --> 13:12.900
The media attention that will go
with this case will be very unkind.

13:12.910 --> 13:15.360
Never mind that you could
lose your perfect record.

13:15.400 --> 13:21.142
This could tarnish that which you cherish
and revere beyond anything else— your legacy.

13:21.360 --> 13:27.780
As desperate as you are to be in
the game again, you're not up to this.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.000
Appreciate the candor.

13:35.730 --> 13:38.730
I have no doubt it comes from love.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.700
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a trial to prepare.

13:42.710 --> 13:44.640
–Denny—
–Get out.

13:45.270 --> 13:47.550
This is my office.

13:50.100 --> 13:54.870
Four years, I sat around, watching
you have your day in court.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.640
Well, I want my day.

13:56.650 --> 13:58.290
And you once had
your day, and now—

13:58.330 --> 14:00.900
I am not over!

14:03.280 --> 14:06.382
Maybe— maybe— maybe
I can't do it all the time.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.670
But every once in a while…

14:12.780 --> 14:15.140
I can rise up.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.420
And I will rise up here.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.740
And for you not
to be on my side—

14:29.780 --> 14:31.560
You can accuse me of many things,

14:31.600 --> 14:34.880
but not being on your
side isn't one of them.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.770
I'm afraid for you.

14:37.780 --> 14:40.000
I don't wanna…

14:40.310 --> 14:43.380
see you get hurt.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.000
I'll be fine.

14:51.890 --> 14:56.500
And I don't want you
anywhere near this case.

15:14.090 --> 15:15.860
Oh, what the hell?

15:16.190 --> 15:17.280
Ritual.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.870
I like to wear my waders
the night before a trial.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.280
Empowers me.

15:22.090 --> 15:24.466
How's your opening statement coming?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.280
All done.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.340
Powerful.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.430
Oh, just so I don't feel like
an idiot, what's the plan?

15:30.470 --> 15:31.620
Mad cow.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.250
I mean, temporary insanity.

15:33.290 --> 15:34.370
I got my expert all lined up.

15:34.410 --> 15:36.620
She'll examine our client.

15:36.630 --> 15:37.920
Anything I can do?

15:37.930 --> 15:41.580
Just watch and learn from the master.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.430
Gotta pee.

16:03.140 --> 16:07.100
Evidence will show that Penelope
Kimball was the only one there.

16:07.140 --> 16:11.580
We will introduce the defendant's
own admission that she killed him.

16:11.620 --> 16:15.050
We'll establish motive in that the
victim was planning to leave her.

16:15.090 --> 16:21.400
Evidence will furthermore establish that
the defendant has no history of any
mental or psychological disorder.

16:21.440 --> 16:27.000
In short, the facts will show that this
was just a good old-fashioned murder.

16:35.860 --> 16:37.210
Denny.

16:51.560 --> 16:55.670
I've listened to the DA's opening, and I'm
thinking, why the hell didn't I plead this out?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.850
Am I insane?

16:59.040 --> 17:02.640
Or is Penelope Kimball insane?

17:02.650 --> 17:05.480
Which is it, her or me, me or her?

17:05.950 --> 17:08.720
Can't be sure, can we?

17:10.060 --> 17:13.480
That's reasonable doubt.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.890
Denny Crane.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.720
The fun starts now.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.080
Wait a second.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.990
You're suing me for representing him?

17:39.030 --> 17:41.920
Well, your involvement goes a bit
further than representation, Mr Gould.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.890
Your billboards actually induced
Mr Winston to leave his wife.

17:44.930 --> 17:49.430
Are you seriously blaming the
demise of a marriage on a billboard?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.930
Why would you pay thousands of dollars
to put them up if you didn't believe
they'd be influential?

17:52.970 --> 17:54.430
–This is silly.
–Is it?

17:54.470 --> 17:55.980
The billboards led him to your web site.

17:56.020 --> 18:00.060
You then set him up with a relationship counselor
who concluded his marriage wasn't working.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.250
Something tells me those
conclusions are in the bag.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.250
One could say a bit of
brainwashing goes on.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.200
One could.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.000
One could never prove
that in a court of law.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.240
Mr Gould, let's face it.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.560
Those ads are sleazy.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.880
This gives all lawyers a bad name.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.080
First I'm responsible for
the breakup of a marriage.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.320
Now I'm to blame for
lawyers having a bad name?

18:17.330 --> 18:19.220
You want to pin global
warming on me next?

18:19.260 --> 18:21.480
My husband is a very susceptible person.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.440
You influenced him.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.910
I don't want to be with you, Mary.

18:24.950 --> 18:27.326
–They've convinced you of that.
–No.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.640
I've been profoundly
unhappy, even depressed.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.880
Maybe they just made me face up to it.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.760
No. No.

18:36.580 --> 18:38.450
We should go.

18:53.790 --> 18:56.590
When I arrived, the first thing
she said was she killed him.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.380
She just admitted it.

18:58.390 --> 19:01.110
Could you describe
Mrs Kimball's demeanor?

19:01.150 --> 19:02.430
She was very upset.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.560
But she was certainly coherent.

19:04.570 --> 19:08.464
She wasn't crazy or erratic
or out of her mind or anything.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.780
Who called the police?

19:10.790 --> 19:11.520
She did.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.680
So she wasn't trying to
get away with anything here.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.320
No. Like I said, she just admitted it.

19:16.330 --> 19:18.410
So you say she was upset.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.920
She was, in fact, grieving
for her husband, was she not?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.490
She seemed to be, yes.

19:22.500 --> 19:27.750
So she hits him on the head with a
shovel and then is upset that he's dead.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.260
Sounds crazy to me.

19:32.890 --> 19:34.890
Does it not to you?

19:37.030 --> 19:39.120
Gardening is my sanity.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.330
It's my release.

19:40.340 --> 19:46.020
And I went there to just sort of plan in my
head where I'd like to plant which vegetables.

19:46.060 --> 19:49.680
I always get this calm when…

19:51.170 --> 19:54.340
Anyway, Walter came out.

19:54.350 --> 19:55.220
We started talking.

19:55.260 --> 19:58.580
It was rather civil, actually.

19:58.590 --> 20:03.130
Then he started giving
me his little suggestions

20:03.140 --> 20:05.960
as to where the turnips should go

20:05.970 --> 20:09.600
and the brussels sprouts and
where the light hits best,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.760
and I started getting… angry.

20:13.770 --> 20:14.730
Mad.

20:14.740 --> 20:20.050
Here he is, leaving me, and
still he's exercising control.

20:20.060 --> 20:25.380
I mean, the man left me so alone for so
long, all I had at times was my garden.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.320
And he's exercising dominion over that.

20:28.330 --> 20:32.490
And I remember feeling
my face get very hot,

20:32.500 --> 20:35.240
really, really hot.

20:35.250 --> 20:40.010
And he kept talking and talking
and telling me what to do, and…

20:40.650 --> 20:45.890
suddenly I saw the head of a
shovel hurtling through the air,

20:45.900 --> 20:48.030
and it struck him.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.630
It hit him right on the
head, and he went down.

20:50.670 --> 20:55.850
And I followed the shaft
of the shovel back to…

20:56.570 --> 20:58.900
my hands.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.270
I killed him.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.590
–You were suddenly crazy.
–Objection.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.110
–Suddenly insane.
–Objection.

21:07.150 --> 21:08.480
–Suddenly single.
–Ob—

21:08.520 --> 21:11.930
Penelope, did you make a decision to hit
your husband on the head with a shovel?

21:11.970 --> 21:13.500
No, I swear.

21:13.510 --> 21:15.680
Suddenly it was just…

21:15.690 --> 21:18.940
in motion. It just happened.

21:20.130 --> 21:25.344
It also just so happened the very week
you decided to separate, you killed him.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.140
I just snapped.

21:28.150 --> 21:32.830
Were you getting therapy or any
kind of medical treatment prior to
your whacking him on the head?

21:32.870 --> 21:33.590
No.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.830
So basically you were sane in
the morning, sane in the afternoon,

21:36.870 --> 21:40.330
and you just took a brief time-out in between
to be crazy and kill your husband?

21:40.370 --> 21:41.200
Objection.

21:41.210 --> 21:42.340
Sustained.

21:42.350 --> 21:45.110
If you were divorced, I take
it you'd each get half, right?

21:45.150 --> 21:45.720
Yes.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.380
But with him dying, you get it all.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.890
Not if I'm convicted of killing him.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.970
Oh, so you checked that
out, huh? Good for you.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.450
–Objection.
–Sustained.

21:53.490 --> 21:57.230
Actually, if you get off on the grounds of
temporary insanity, you would get it all.

21:57.270 --> 21:59.220
I mean, you wouldn't be disqualified.

21:59.260 --> 22:00.760
So it'd all work out
for you, wouldn't it?

22:00.800 --> 22:03.000
–Objection.
–Sustained.

22:03.010 --> 22:04.520
Nothing further.

22:16.380 --> 22:19.130
Look, I can certainly say she was
in a compromised mental state,

22:19.170 --> 22:21.290
but whether it rose to the
level of legal insanity—

22:21.330 --> 22:22.890
I don't think you understand, doctor.

22:22.930 --> 22:26.440
Unless you can say she was
temporarily insane, we don't win.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.280
Mr Crane, you hired me to give
you an objective diagnosis.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.230
–Like hell.
–Denny.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.460
There's a $25,000 check right
there for your testimony.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.090
If you can't say she was
insane, you don't get it.

22:38.130 --> 22:39.770
Denny.

22:39.780 --> 22:42.780
My testimony cannot be bought,
Mr Crane.

22:43.210 --> 22:46.140
That money will go to an
expert witness who can say that

22:46.180 --> 22:52.780
Penelope Kimball did not understand
the nature and quality of her actions
when she swung the shovel.

22:53.170 --> 22:55.570
Are you that expert?

22:56.550 --> 23:00.130
That's the $25,000 question.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.350
She's suffering from perimenopause.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.340
This is the period a year to
two years before menopause.

23:13.380 --> 23:14.690
Can it affect her mind?

23:14.730 --> 23:16.340
Oh, boy.

23:16.350 --> 23:20.046
We're gonna need something
more clinical than ”oh, boy.“

23:20.720 --> 23:25.780
Uh, basically the ovaries make
erratic amounts of estrogen.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.910
It can render the brain completely
at the mercy of hormones.

23:28.950 --> 23:33.140
She says she made no conscious
decision to swing the shovel.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.440
Possible?

23:34.450 --> 23:38.120
That's an extreme case,
but it's entirely possible.

23:38.130 --> 23:38.940
Did you examine her?

23:38.980 --> 23:39.650
I did.

23:39.660 --> 23:42.330
And when she says she has no
memory of picking up the shovel

23:42.370 --> 23:45.390
and deciding to swing
it, do you believe her?

23:45.890 --> 23:47.480
I do.

23:47.490 --> 23:50.850
My opinion is, her actions here were…

23:50.860 --> 23:53.230
not voluntary.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.060
How long have you treated this woman?

23:55.100 --> 23:59.860
I just examined her twice, but I reviewed
the records of her internist, her ob-gyn.

23:59.900 --> 24:05.020
How likely, honestly, doctor, is it for
perimenopause to render a person homicidal?

24:05.060 --> 24:07.310
Extremely unlikely, but it's possible.

24:07.350 --> 24:09.370
Plus there's no evidence
she was homicidal.

24:09.410 --> 24:11.050
She delivered a fatal
blow to a man's head—

24:11.090 --> 24:12.780
But possibly without
intent, since—

24:12.820 --> 24:14.470
She has no history of
any mental disorder—

24:14.510 --> 24:16.770
Nor do many suffers of perimenopause.

24:16.810 --> 24:18.980
The neurotransmitters are in flux.
–It just seems like a very convenient time
for someone to lose control, swing a shovel…

24:19.020 --> 24:21.650
–…there is no typical perimenopausal syndrome.
–Which just happened to solve a lot of problems for her.

24:21.690 --> 24:22.590
All right!

24:22.600 --> 24:25.200
Well, somebody doesn't like to lose.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.970
Objection.

24:36.710 --> 24:38.290
How are we doing?

24:39.030 --> 24:39.910
Well.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.200
Uh, we had a conference with
the husband and his lawyer.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.040
–Good.
–They laughed and walked out.

24:44.080 --> 24:44.580
Not good.

24:44.620 --> 24:46.210
–So we filed a complaint.
–Good.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.550
And they're bringing an
immediate motion to dismiss.

24:48.590 --> 24:49.250
Not good.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.970
Jerry's going to argue.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.970
What was that?

25:00.980 --> 25:01.770
You're just nervous.

25:01.810 --> 25:03.260
I've never done that before.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.650
I think you should argue.

25:04.690 --> 25:06.730
I would, but I haven't the
slightest idea what I'd say.

25:06.770 --> 25:09.400
Katie, until I get these strange
tics of mine under control—

25:09.440 --> 25:14.380
I could be wrong, but it seems if you refuse
to argue, you'd be letting the tics control you.

25:14.420 --> 25:17.260
It's lawful for attorneys to advertise.

25:17.270 --> 25:19.040
That's all I did.

25:19.530 --> 25:22.210
Divorce is a growth industry.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.450
Over half of marriages dissolve.

25:24.460 --> 25:27.180
I'm simply appealing to that market.

25:27.190 --> 25:30.260
The personal injury lawyers
are everywhere with their ads.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.290
“If you've been hurt, call
1-800…” whatever.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.700
Why is what I've done any different?

25:37.040 --> 25:39.530
This case should be summarily dismissed.

25:39.570 --> 25:42.650
And I ask that the plaintiff
be ordered to pay the costs

25:42.690 --> 25:45.528
and attorney fees of
this frivolous action.

26:11.300 --> 26:15.460
I still remember the first time
I saw “to kill a mockingbird.”

26:16.000 --> 26:19.880
Watching Gregory Peck
as Atticus Finch…

26:20.470 --> 26:26.410
I thought, wow, to be a
lawyer, what a noble thing.

26:28.260 --> 26:30.760
How far we've slid.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.140
But this…

26:34.370 --> 26:40.230
I realize, your honor, we're
hardly a moral society anymore.

26:40.240 --> 26:46.670
We derive hundreds and hundreds of billions
of dollars in revenue from pornography,

26:46.680 --> 26:50.350
gambling, tobacco, illegal
drugs, prostitution.

26:50.360 --> 26:54.060
One major american city
actually markets itself

26:54.070 --> 26:57.740
to tourists as the place
to come to commit adultery.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.710
“What happens in vegas stays in vegas.”

27:01.100 --> 27:06.400
So what's the big deal about
a few distasteful attorney ads?

27:07.670 --> 27:11.130
Well, a lot.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.790
What does it say when
the officers of our court,

27:13.830 --> 27:19.830
the players in our justice system,
overtly embrace sleaziness?

27:19.840 --> 27:25.370
I realize we can't all be noble, but what's
truly sad is that integrity, dignity—

27:25.380 --> 27:29.240
they aren't even goals
we aspire to anymore.

27:29.250 --> 27:33.630
These ads cheapen and
demean the legal profession.

27:33.640 --> 27:37.390
They did great damage to Mary
Winston, whose marriage ended,

27:37.430 --> 27:39.940
in part as a result of
Mr Gould's influence.

27:39.980 --> 27:41.620
It's wrong, your honor.

27:41.630 --> 27:46.448
And if you allow us to have our day
in court, I think a jury might agree.

28:13.410 --> 28:15.540
I come in peace.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.790
How's the trial going?

28:19.800 --> 28:21.780
You tell me.

28:22.540 --> 28:25.774
You don't think I know
you're sitting back there?

28:26.880 --> 28:29.640
–Denny, I just–
–I-I-I know it.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.360
How am I doing?

28:35.370 --> 28:37.710
You're doing great.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.450
I think you actually
have a chance of winning.

28:43.750 --> 28:46.190
Who's doing the closing?

28:46.200 --> 28:47.960
I am.

28:49.370 --> 28:51.790
Do you know what
you plan to say?

28:52.630 --> 28:54.550
No.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.210
Can I help?

28:56.220 --> 28:58.440
I'm sure you can, but, uh…

29:01.650 --> 29:04.980
As much as you're determined to fly
solo, there's a woman whose life—

29:05.020 --> 29:07.470
I-I-I know that.

29:07.480 --> 29:12.250
It's just— I'm— I'm
working on this myself.

29:12.260 --> 29:15.350
And if I need any help,
I'll— I'll ask you for it.

29:15.390 --> 29:17.150
Okay.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.960
Denny, you've been
doing a fabulous—

29:21.000 --> 29:23.740
–That puts pressure on me!
–Sorry.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.350
I'm here if you need me, and…

29:30.360 --> 29:32.480
not if you don't.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.010
Thank you.

29:49.010 --> 29:51.160
How's he doing?

29:52.780 --> 29:54.540
He's in the game.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.870
Imagine if we gave every
woman going through menopause

30:15.910 --> 30:19.950
or perimenopause a free
ticket to kill somebody.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.450
That's basically what
the defense is suggesting.

30:22.490 --> 30:28.420
Nowhere anywhere in the scientific community
has anybody likened perimenopause to insanity.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.600
It's ridiculous.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.080
Ask the husbands.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.320
Mr Crane.

30:32.330 --> 30:36.092
Married six times, judge, four
of them wanted to kill me.

30:36.350 --> 30:38.200
He thinks this is amusing.

30:38.210 --> 30:40.950
Spousicide is anything but.

30:40.960 --> 30:45.860
Six people are murdered in this country every
single day by spouses or intimate partners.

30:45.900 --> 30:49.720
This is hardly the type of crime
or trial we should shrug off.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.260
Don't any of you dare shrug this off.

30:53.270 --> 30:59.010
She delivered a brutal, fatal blow
to the back of her husband's head.

30:59.350 --> 31:03.240
It was an unprovoked,
voluntary attack.

31:03.250 --> 31:07.160
She had no history of any
mental disorder whatsoever.

31:07.170 --> 31:09.690
She was caught holding
the shovel in her hand.

31:09.730 --> 31:11.210
He was leaving her.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.460
A divorce would have meant a
forfeiture of half of her assets.

31:14.500 --> 31:20.630
She had an emotional motive, she had
a financial motive, and she confessed.

31:24.900 --> 31:27.360
What more do you need?

31:34.820 --> 31:36.900
You're fine.

32:10.310 --> 32:12.260
I-if you're convinced beyond
all reasonable doubt that

32:12.300 --> 32:17.850
my client voluntarily and with malice
aforethought killed her husband…

32:19.200 --> 32:21.880
then you should convict.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.890
But, uh…

32:27.900 --> 32:31.150
you simply cannot
be convinced of that.

32:31.160 --> 32:35.140
This woman had no history
of violence or crime.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.150
Clearly she didn't plan this.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.020
There are— there are better
ways of getting away with murder

32:39.060 --> 32:43.416
than hitting somebody on the head
with a shovel in broad daylight.

32:43.470 --> 32:47.420
Mr Swarthmore says that she was
caught with the shovel in her hands.

32:47.460 --> 32:48.960
That's— that's not true.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.360
She called the police.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.120
He says she confessed. That's not true.

32:53.130 --> 32:57.040
She admitted to swinging the shovel,
but she never confessed to intent.

32:57.080 --> 33:01.110
She had and still has no
memory of deciding to do it.

33:01.120 --> 33:06.830
And even if she really had planned to
kill her husband using insanity as a ruse,

33:06.840 --> 33:12.050
don't you think she would've manifested some
symptoms beforehand to set up the defense? No.

33:12.090 --> 33:18.300
When you consider all the circumstances of
this, the most likely conclusion has to be…

33:19.450 --> 33:22.770
she simply snapped.

33:22.780 --> 33:25.250
As for perimenopause
inducing insanity,

33:25.290 --> 33:28.960
we never said that it caused
prolonged dementia and delusions.

33:29.000 --> 33:35.740
We're saying that it triggered a flash of
violence, an impulsive, involuntary reaction.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.410
You heard Dr Rosewell.

33:37.420 --> 33:43.010
There is documented, objective proof
that her estrogen levels were spiking.

33:43.020 --> 33:49.630
The prosecutor has offered no doctor to
rule out what we said because no doctors can.

33:51.970 --> 33:54.260
Nor can you.

33:54.760 --> 33:59.630
The reality is, there is no
reason for Penelope Kimball

33:59.640 --> 34:01.860
to pick up that shovel and swing it.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.660
It makes no sense.

34:03.670 --> 34:07.250
The only explanation is…

34:08.960 --> 34:13.040
in an instant, in an impulse, she…

34:14.420 --> 34:16.679
lost herself.

34:24.510 --> 34:28.601
I said at the beginning, “the
fun starts now.” There's no fun.

34:29.010 --> 34:34.320
A man has lost his life, an innocent
woman is faced with losing hers.

34:34.580 --> 34:37.730
No intent. No malice aforethought.

34:38.159 --> 34:44.880
And even if you should somehow believe
otherwise, you cannot be so convinced…

34:45.400 --> 34:48.790
beyond all reasonable doubt.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.620
You simply cannot.

35:23.910 --> 35:25.930
Lawyers can advertise now.

35:25.940 --> 35:30.090
I'm not a fan of it, but it is
permissible for them to do so.

35:30.100 --> 35:33.630
And, Mr Espenson, let's face it, with
the proliferation of law schools,

35:33.670 --> 35:37.920
the shady and disreputable are
members of our brethren for good.

35:37.930 --> 35:43.900
But as low as the bar has been set, these
billboards seem to slither right under it.

35:43.910 --> 35:49.370
It's one thing to bottom-feed with personal
injury cases and divorce cases and the like.

35:49.410 --> 35:55.800
It is quite another to be proponents of
divorce then steer clients in that direction.

35:55.810 --> 36:00.220
The institution of marriage already
has enough trouble without your help.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.140
I'm letting this case go to a jury.

36:02.180 --> 36:03.740
Thank you, judge!

36:06.490 --> 36:08.470
I beg your pardon.

36:13.510 --> 36:14.900
I don't know what to say.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.730
I am so grateful.

36:16.740 --> 36:17.450
You were brilliant.

36:17.490 --> 36:19.340
–Brilliant!
–Brilliant!

36:19.810 --> 36:21.070
Kidding.

36:22.870 --> 36:24.480
May I say something else, Jerry?

36:24.520 --> 36:27.390
I thought your argument was
eloquent, a model of dignity

36:27.430 --> 36:30.980
and a noble example of what every other
attorney should aspire to live up to.

36:31.020 --> 36:31.490
Thank you.

36:31.530 --> 36:32.960
–Not to mention brilliant.
–Brilliant!

36:33.000 --> 36:34.570
Brilliant!

36:46.970 --> 36:48.540
Where's Penelope?

36:48.550 --> 36:50.080
Bathroom.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.140
Denny, that closing was superb.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.750
Really?

37:05.760 --> 37:07.910
It was fantastic.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.700
I didn't think this case was winnable.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.424
But you just gave that
jury a lot to think about.

37:17.710 --> 37:19.450
Jury's back.

37:23.150 --> 37:25.550
Evidently they think quickly.

37:26.290 --> 37:28.700
You go. Just come back and tell me.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.520
I don't think I can.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.290
Let's go.

37:39.370 --> 37:44.180
Okay, I will remind everybody
we have three counts.

37:44.190 --> 37:48.010
Let's keep the decorum until
all three verdicts are read.

37:48.020 --> 37:50.750
Will the defendant please rise?

37:52.850 --> 37:54.870
Mr Foreman, what say you?

37:54.880 --> 37:58.560
“In the matter of the Commonwealth
of massachusetts vs Penelope Kimball,

37:58.600 --> 38:01.500
”on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

38:01.540 --> 38:04.870
”we find the defendant not guilty.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.610
”On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

38:07.650 --> 38:10.730
we find the defendant not guilty.

38:10.740 --> 38:15.190
”But on the charge of manslaughter,
we find the defendant…

38:16.150 --> 38:17.740
not guilty.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.850
Oh, my God.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.572
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, thank you for your services.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.640
Keep it civil. Can you do that?

38:30.680 --> 38:32.198
Give us a little space.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.020
Hang on there just a moment, will you?

38:44.060 --> 38:46.700
One— one question at
a time. I'm only human.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.780
Actually, I'm not. I'm Denny Crane.

38:48.820 --> 38:52.280
Reasonable doubt for a reasonable fee—
that's a Denny Crane promise.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.430
Hold 'em off for a second, will
you? I need a moment.

38:54.470 --> 38:56.520
Be right back, folks.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.640
How we doin'?

39:27.650 --> 39:30.050
Doing fine. Why wouldn't I be?

39:30.750 --> 39:32.880
No reason at all.

39:33.910 --> 39:35.800
The press is waiting.

39:40.920 --> 39:44.600
<i>This is not just a great day
for justice and Penelope Kimball,</i>

39:44.640 --> 39:47.750
<i>but for gardeners all across
this country, when you think of it.</i>

39:47.790 --> 39:50.350
<i>There are democrats at
this very moment out there</i>

39:50.390 --> 39:55.440
<i>who are sponsoring legislation to impose
waiting periods on sharp-edged shovels</i>

39:55.480 --> 40:00.430
<i>and spades under the misguided
notion that shovels kill, not people.</i>

40:03.080 --> 40:04.790
Alan…

40:06.120 --> 40:09.340
I wasn't sure I'd ever have
a moment like that again.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.630
What a moment it was.

40:12.980 --> 40:16.130
And to think you wanted to
prevent me from sharing it.

40:16.170 --> 40:18.120
Here we go.

40:18.490 --> 40:21.724
You look ridiculous in
that disguise, by the way.

40:22.430 --> 40:24.110
I'm glad you were there.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.200
Of course you are.

40:27.070 --> 40:28.340
Go ahead.

40:28.350 --> 40:30.330
I know it's coming. Go ahead.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.800
Sleepover tonight?

40:32.960 --> 40:35.040
Did it ever occur to you that
after a victory like that,

40:35.080 --> 40:39.650
I might qualify for
some serious sex tonight?

40:40.020 --> 40:41.472
That I'm not offering.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.450
Maybe with Penelope.

40:44.460 --> 40:46.360
Maybe the judge. Did you
see the look she gave me?

40:46.400 --> 40:48.570
She gave you several looks.

40:52.300 --> 40:58.920
But, Denny, a day like this truly needs to
be savored in the company of a best friend.

40:59.900 --> 41:01.930
Which would be you.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.110
Which would be me.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.540
Which would be you.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.060
I was something, wasn't I?

41:17.070 --> 41:20.020
Denny, you are always something.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.890
I don't want this day to end.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.240
Neither do I.
