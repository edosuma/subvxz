17:12.359 --> 17:14.020
[TOGETHER] Aww.

17:19.099 --> 17:21.359
Victor, it's okay to be scared.

17:23.829 --> 17:25.699
- Give me the shot.
- Whoo!

17:25.700 --> 17:27.970
- Yeah.
- Do it.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.490
Live fast. Die young.

17:32.070 --> 17:33.140
Okay.

17:34.510 --> 17:35.809
Ahh.

17:35.810 --> 17:37.050
[GROANS]

17:37.780 --> 17:39.310
Oh, no.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.349
E minor wasn't even the
right choice for the song.

17:44.350 --> 17:46.449
Uh, you wasn't even the
right choice for the song.

17:46.450 --> 17:47.240
Okay, enough.

17:47.450 --> 17:48.919
Tonight is about the free clinic.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.940
You guys might not care
about it, but I really do.

17:51.060 --> 17:52.470
All right, look, I kind
of feel like I gave her

17:52.480 --> 17:53.920
what she needs, and you
weren't able to do that,

17:53.930 --> 17:56.400
so why don't we just shake
hands and you admit that I won.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.020
_

17:58.920 --> 18:00.660
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

18:01.490 --> 18:02.820
- Victor?
- Oh, God.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.389
- I've got to pee. Oh.
- [GAGGING]

18:04.390 --> 18:06.830
- What are...
- Wait, is that Victor?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.329
- Ohh.
- Excuse me.

18:08.330 --> 18:09.560
Who are all these kids?

18:09.570 --> 18:10.699
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.600
- Are they drunk?
- Move, move.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.140
Wait, there are students here?

18:14.200 --> 18:15.020
Oh, my God. We've got to bounce.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.260
Uh-uh, I'm not going down for this.

18:16.370 --> 18:18.200
Jack, please tell me
that we are not holding this

18:18.220 --> 18:19.750
fund-raiser at one of
your student's houses.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.740
- Oh, God.
- Look, everything...

18:21.040 --> 18:22.810
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.290
Panty raid!

18:25.720 --> 18:27.319
Whoo! Yeah!

18:27.320 --> 18:29.749
- Uh...
- Whoo! Whoo!

18:29.750 --> 18:31.220
It is in every '80s movie.

18:34.290 --> 18:36.790
This party's about to
get a servin' of Durbin.

18:37.470 --> 18:38.969
Second time's a charm.

18:38.970 --> 18:41.320
Ralph, no, no, no. This
party is not for you.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.300
See, I knew I wasn't invited.

18:43.410 --> 18:45.299
This place is a freakin' maze.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.409
How am I supposed to pee
if there are no bathrooms?

18:47.410 --> 18:48.939
- Everyone...
- Seriously?

18:48.940 --> 18:50.060
Excuse me.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.090
Everyone, could I have
your attention, please?

18:53.210 --> 18:55.380
Sorry, it... sorry.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.579
It has come to my attention
that we don't have permission

18:57.580 --> 18:59.210
to be here, so unfortunately,

18:59.220 --> 19:01.280
we all need to leave immediately.

19:01.290 --> 19:02.520
You okay, bud?

19:03.010 --> 19:04.850
I feel great.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.069
Thanks for letting us
stay. You were right.

19:07.070 --> 19:09.560
I was wound too tight,
and I needed to let go.

19:09.770 --> 19:13.000
Now I have a crazy party memory.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.170
I've got to go journal
this before I black out.

19:15.340 --> 19:16.590
Whoa, what do you mean, "black out?"

19:16.620 --> 19:17.480
How much did you drink?

19:17.540 --> 19:19.130
- One shot.
- One sh...

19:20.640 --> 19:21.940
All right, listen to me. Listen to me.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.200
You're gonna be fine, okay?

19:24.210 --> 19:25.439
- Okay.
- All right.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.619
- You got a breath mint?
- Yeah.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.459
- Yeah, use it.
- Okay, I'll be back.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.430
Okay.

19:29.431 --> 19:30.760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:30.840 --> 19:31.929
Excuse me, guys. Excuse me.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.399
Could I just have your
attention, please,

19:33.400 --> 19:34.579
just for one quick second?

19:34.580 --> 19:38.150
It is true that we don't have
permission to be here, okay?

19:38.180 --> 19:40.020
But that is mostly my fault,
so please don't take it out

19:40.060 --> 19:41.099
on the free clinic.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.669
These guys, they're relying on you.

19:42.670 --> 19:45.280
Your contributions, they
keep the lights on and the...

19:46.040 --> 19:49.840
Band-Aids sticky, or whatever
else goes on in a free clinic.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.809
You get my point. Look,
before you leave, please,

19:52.810 --> 19:55.680
just hit the donation table first, okay?

19:56.450 --> 19:58.190
All right, great, thank you.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.730
Thanks, everybody.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.890
Thank you, Jack.

20:02.170 --> 20:03.699
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.330
You want to hit the silent
auction table with me?

20:05.340 --> 20:06.969
- Yes.
- Okay, 'cause I think Jack

20:06.970 --> 20:08.739
probably has to tuck in his friends.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.960
Ahh-ahh!

20:09.990 --> 20:11.170
Whoa.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.500
Now you, lady, punch me in the face.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.529
Oh, no, no, no, no, I
didn't ask her to do that.

20:15.530 --> 20:17.270
That's... that was just gravy.

20:17.290 --> 20:18.400
Come on. Let's go.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.709
I'll... I'll talk to you soon.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.670
All right, all right, easy, tiger.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.790
Get with your friends, Heather.

20:22.810 --> 20:24.740
Wow, she wasn't kidding.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.619
All right, well, time to leave.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.300
Let's get you in some
Ubers. What do you say, huh?

20:32.050 --> 20:34.089
There were five entire garbage bags

20:34.090 --> 20:35.900
stuffed in the bins, Victor.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.000
Did you have a party?

20:44.500 --> 20:46.070
I know about the affairs.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.820
Go to your room.
