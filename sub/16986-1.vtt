00:48.757 --> 00:49.925
Nobody panic.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.970
Yes, I'm hanging off a cliff,
and yes, the sky just ate the sun,

00:53.053 --> 00:56.056
but I'm sure my pelt will hold
and since the sky's belly is full now,

00:56.139 --> 00:57.266
I'm sure we'll be fine...

00:57.349 --> 00:59.077
- [branch creaking]
- Ahh! My pelt's not holding!

01:13.448 --> 01:14.825
Come on, you bozos.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.828
I've seen the sun disappear before
and we gotta run.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.787
I don't know.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.124
I tried running in the dark
before and it did not go well.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.750
Ignore your grandma, kids.

01:23.834 --> 01:27.838
What we need to do now is just get
used to living in total darkness forever.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.274
- The inside of your head...
- [grunts]

01:29.298 --> 01:30.841
is total darkness forever.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.176
The sun will come back.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.471
But till it does, the liyotes
are gonna be freakin' out.

01:36.555 --> 01:40.225
This darkness turns those
dumb furbags into dumb monsters

01:40.309 --> 01:42.561
who will feast on our guts!

01:42.644 --> 01:43.562
Wait.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.481
So, Mom, you know
how I have to be home by dark?

01:46.565 --> 01:50.527
Well, now I can stay out
as long as I want, right?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.654
Mmm.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.531
I'm serious.

01:54.615 --> 01:59.494
Last time the sun went out,
liyotes tore off my tail.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.747
Eh, this one's a fake.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.206

02:03.290 --> 02:05.459

Run!

02:07.669 --> 02:09.086
[grunting]

02:09.170 --> 02:11.381
This is no time for hugging.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.719
What part of... [howling]
don't you understand?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.262
- [snarling]
- [gasping]

02:17.846 --> 02:18.722
Mom?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.432
- Gran?
- Thunk?

02:20.515 --> 02:23.101
- Oh, whew, I'm right here.
- Huh? What the...

02:24.978 --> 02:26.855
Make up your mind, sun.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.774
Mom, where are you?

02:28.857 --> 02:32.402
- Say something.
- I told you so!

02:32.486 --> 02:33.320
[gasping]

02:33.403 --> 02:34.946
- [all gasp]
- [scoffs]

02:35.864 --> 02:37.824
- Mom!
- [sniffing]

02:37.908 --> 02:39.326
Mom!

02:39.409 --> 02:41.620
Oh, what if she's hurt?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.749
What if she's hurt someone else?

02:45.832 --> 02:49.002
- [snarling]
- Relax. That must be her now.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.837
[gasping]

02:51.755 --> 02:55.258
Oh, look.
These nice liyotes found Gran's pelts.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.221
Oh, that's not right, is it?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.390
[sobbing]

03:01.473 --> 03:06.353
We are gathered here today
to say goodbye to Gran Crood.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.232
May she rest in peace,
inside the liyote that ate her.

03:10.315 --> 03:16.947
Oh, nothing like faking your own death
to teach loved ones a lesson.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.949
- [growling]
- Find another chew bone.

03:19.032 --> 03:19.866
[whimpering]

03:19.950 --> 03:22.828
Let me enjoy my family's misery
in peace.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.788
[sniffling]

03:24.871 --> 03:28.166
Gran always told the best stories.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.627
They always ended
in someone's horrible death,

03:30.710 --> 03:33.880
so it's only fitting that she did, too.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.424
I'll miss you, Gran.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.677
So, to remember you,
I'll always wear this.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.011
[yelping]

03:40.095 --> 03:42.222
I've lost you a second time.

03:42.305 --> 03:47.227
And now, a few words
from Gran's ex-boyfriend, Mow.

03:47.310 --> 03:51.356
[clears throat, grunts]

03:51.440 --> 03:52.524
Wow.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.444
I've never heard Mow
open up like that before.

03:55.527 --> 03:59.948
Okay, I'm not gonna lie,
Gran and I didn't always get along.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.952
Thank you.

04:04.035 --> 04:08.457
Well, I could stand here all day
talking about how much I'll miss Mom.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.708
[cackling]

04:09.791 --> 04:12.377
But she would want us to move on.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.463
[groans]
Like bonk I would.

04:14.546 --> 04:18.632
What I want is for you to say I was right
and that you feel guilty for ignoring me.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.218
You're right, Mom.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.137
Gran would want us to be happy.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.220
Happy?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.098
You really haven't heard a word I've said.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.641
[Thunk] Why, why?

04:26.725 --> 04:29.478
Oh, now that's more like it.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.647
Why haven't we eaten lunch yet?

04:32.731 --> 04:33.899
I'm starving.

04:33.982 --> 04:34.983
[gasps]

04:37.652 --> 04:41.198
Hmm, still no tears of joy
over Gran's death.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.242
What is wrong with me?

04:44.326 --> 04:48.038
Whoa, I said "what is wrong with me"
and it wasn't followed by an insult.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.081
She really is gone.

04:50.165 --> 04:54.169
Yeah, and it's just not the same
without Gran in the sleep pile.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.172
Dad, what happens when we're eaten?

04:58.381 --> 05:01.218
Well, only one part of you dies,
the outer part.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.220
But there's another part inside.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.263
You mean, like, our guts?

05:05.347 --> 05:08.850
No, the inside part is, like,
your thoughts.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.520
It's what makes you you.

05:11.603 --> 05:16.858
We call it the "stuff"
and the stuff lives on.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.820
Well, can we see Gran's stuff?

05:19.903 --> 05:24.449
No, but it feels better
just knowing it's out there.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.326
Now let's all go to sleep.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.787
[snoring]

05:28.870 --> 05:29.871
[gasps]

05:29.955 --> 05:32.415
Guess they are ready
to forget about me.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.460
Well, I'll show 'em.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.130
[Gran wailing]

05:39.214 --> 05:42.092
Huh?
Who's saying "eww"?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.761
Ugh, did Sandy wet the sleep pile?

05:44.844 --> 05:46.012
I wasn't saying "eww."

05:46.096 --> 05:49.558
I was saying "whoo",
'cause I'm scary.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.518
Wait, Gran, is that you?

05:51.601 --> 05:54.521
No. Gran is dead.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.064
I'm her stuff.

05:56.147 --> 06:01.736
You ignored Gran in life.
Now her stuff will haunt you in death!

06:01.820 --> 06:02.654
Family!

06:02.737 --> 06:04.614
This is weird.
Should I be scared?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.199
I don't...
I don't know.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.493
Gran's stuff,
should we be afraid of you?

06:08.577 --> 06:10.370
Yes.
Fear me!

06:11.204 --> 06:13.665
[moans and cries]

06:13.748 --> 06:14.583
[yawns]

06:14.666 --> 06:17.752
Well, maybe if we ignore Gran's stuff,
it'll get bored and go away.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.546
Sounds like a plan.
'Night.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.965
Oh, yeah?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.843
Well, I have not yet begun to haunt!

06:26.803 --> 06:27.846
[wailing]

06:27.929 --> 06:31.641
Look, object falling
with no explanation.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.186
[gasps]
She broke my hunting rock.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.271
[groaning]

06:36.354 --> 06:39.357
Uh, I mean, I notice nothing.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.483
Mm-hmm.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.155
Hey!
I was exiting that.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.448
[wailing]

06:46.531 --> 06:48.825
Consider yourself haunted.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.751
[Eep grunts] Dad!

06:57.834 --> 07:00.462
- Okay, this isn't working.
- [wailing]

07:00.545 --> 07:03.673
When it comes to weird things,
we know you're the expert, Old Man Root.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.800
Thanks for dropping everything
to help us out.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.762
Ah, let's face it:
I look like a talking bush,

07:08.845 --> 07:11.097
so my social schedule's pretty wide open.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.936
Yep, you got a stuff problem.

07:16.019 --> 07:19.356
I'm sensing a negative energy
right around...

07:19.439 --> 07:21.900
Oh, what's this idiot doing here?

07:21.983 --> 07:23.193
There.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.528
Whoa, he is good!

07:25.612 --> 07:26.780
To cleanse this cave,

07:26.863 --> 07:30.951
you must show Gran's stuff
that it has no power over you.

07:31.034 --> 07:36.623
I suggest you use a sacred chant
passed down by our ancestors.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.210
[sing-song]
"Nah-nah. I can't hear you."

07:40.293 --> 07:42.837
Please. Ha!
Like that's gonna work.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.633
[all chanting]
Nah-nah, we can't hear you.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.595
Nah-nah, we can't hear you.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.347
- Nah-nah, we can't hear you.
- Cut it out.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.057
I'm supposed to be the one annoying you.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.351
[continuing chanting]
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah!

07:56.434 --> 07:58.561
- Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah!
- Stop it!

07:58.645 --> 08:01.189
You can hear me!

08:01.272 --> 08:03.733
[all]
Nah-nah, no, we can't.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.694
Nah-nah, no, we can't.

08:05.777 --> 08:10.031
Fine. If you'll only listen to this guy,
then I'll talk through him.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.157
She's got me.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.743
Leave me, foul spirit!

08:13.827 --> 08:15.787
[muffled groans]

08:16.413 --> 08:19.749
[growly voice] Gran just wants
you idiots to pay attention to her.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.292
[screaming]

08:22.127 --> 08:23.837
This cave's beyond saving.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.798
Get out before she drives you mad!

08:26.881 --> 08:29.050
Phew, I thought he'd never leave.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.220
Well, back to tormenting
you guys for all eternity.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.514
- [screaming]
- [wailing]

08:41.145 --> 08:43.898
Sorry, kids, we can't
live here anymore.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.819
I hear the boiling lava pits
are nice... ish.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.821
You're leavin'?
Fine.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.450
I'm sick of hauntin' you anyway.
Good riddance!

08:53.533 --> 08:54.951
Eh. Wait.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.411
You're really leavin'?

08:56.494 --> 08:58.913
[sighs]
I'm gonna miss this old cave.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.291
Yeah, it was like a friend to me.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.419
A friend made of rocks
whose tummy we lived in.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.336
[sighs]

09:05.420 --> 09:08.965
Now inside, it's only Gran's stuff
and total darkness.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.301
If Gran were here, she'd say,

09:11.384 --> 09:14.679
[imitating Gran] "The total darkness
is inside Grug's head. Ha!"

09:15.138 --> 09:17.557
[sniffling]

09:17.640 --> 09:21.061
Grug, this really isn't
a good time for your tears of joy.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.604
[weeping]
They're not happy tears.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.189
They're sad tears.

09:24.272 --> 09:28.151
The only thing that can
bring back Gran's stuff is Gran.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.779
[sobbing]
I wish she was here.

09:30.862 --> 09:35.700
If we'd just listened to her about the
liyotes, she wouldn't have been eaten.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.829
It's as if we ate her ourselves,
only less gross.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.124
Oh, we should've listened
to her dumb ideas more,

09:43.208 --> 09:44.959
but now we'll never have the chance.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.046
Yes, you will!
Come back.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.631
I'm not really dead.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.594
Free me!
Free me!

09:54.677 --> 09:56.346
Oh, stupid Gran.

09:56.429 --> 10:01.351
You should've guilt-tripped 'em
like always, but no.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.728
Fakin' your death had more pizzazz.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.483
Hey, you, with the jaws of life.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.111
Still wanna chew on this old bone?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.362
Oh ho!

10:12.445 --> 10:15.031
[screaming]

10:15.115 --> 10:16.115
Shoo!

10:16.157 --> 10:19.119
Gran's stuff lives there,
and trust me, you can't handle it.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.579
- [snarling]
- [grunting]

10:22.580 --> 10:24.791
[whimpering]

10:26.209 --> 10:29.587
[gasps]
Gran's stuff is gone!

10:29.671 --> 10:33.258
- [screaming]
- [coughing]

10:34.217 --> 10:35.093
Surprise.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.429
I'm not dead, just quite old.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.764
[all]
Gran!

10:39.848 --> 10:42.809
- Gran's alive!
- Yay!

10:42.892 --> 10:45.228
Who is that body we buried, then?

10:45.311 --> 10:48.857
I was just pretending to be dead
to teach you all a lesson.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.733
To never trust anyone over 30?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.528
That even a grandmother's love
has strings attached?

10:53.611 --> 10:54.612
No.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.989
To pay attention to your gran,

10:56.072 --> 10:59.242
'cause one day,
she won't be around to nag at you.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.996
What?
Eventually, I'm movin' to the beach.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.748
You were really gonna miss me,
weren't you, Grug?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.250
What, this?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.710
No, it's seasonal.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.297
All right.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.048
I'm glad you're alive.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.968
Aww, wish I could say the same for you.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.970
[laughing]

11:23.057 --> 11:26.185
It's good to see everyone happy again.

11:26.269 --> 11:31.190
It should've been Mow!

11:31.274 --> 11:33.318
[thunder rumbling]

11:34.360 --> 11:36.112
[music playing]

11:45.663 --> 11:47.582
And there.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.750
[gasps]

11:48.833 --> 11:50.251
Uh, what's that?

11:50.335 --> 11:53.421
No, you're the best friend
a girl could ask for.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.298
[laughs] You are.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.216
[panting]

12:01.220 --> 12:02.972
- [squeals]
- [gasps]

12:04.307 --> 12:05.475
[gasps]

12:05.558 --> 12:07.101
[grunts]

12:07.185 --> 12:09.687
[gasps]
My back-up Eep!

12:09.771 --> 12:11.648
I had weird plans for you!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.232
[panting]

12:13.316 --> 12:14.859
Not too much, dear.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.779
Keep it hunter in the front,
gatherer in the back.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.072
[panting]

12:19.447 --> 12:21.491
- [scowling]
- [shrieks]

12:21.574 --> 12:22.867
[gasps]
My hair!

12:22.951 --> 12:24.577
Without it, I'm hideous!

12:24.661 --> 12:27.163
Why is that little Crood
running rampant?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.332
She escaped her cheek.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.209
Run, Sandy.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.794
Live for both of us!

12:33.795 --> 12:35.672
Hey, great news, everybody.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.968
We caught a buffalippo so huge,
it'll feed us all for a week!

12:41.260 --> 12:42.095
[mooing]

12:42.178 --> 12:43.638
I call its cute ears.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.183
- I call its ugly face.
- I call its dainty hooves.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.769
We'll eat every part of the buffalippo!

12:49.852 --> 12:51.229
[panting]

12:55.108 --> 12:56.693
Sandy? Why are you...

12:56.776 --> 12:58.820
Down, girl, down. Down!

13:00.571 --> 13:03.908
- [giggling]
- [bellowing]

13:03.992 --> 13:06.577
My delicious dainty hooves!

13:06.661 --> 13:07.704
[panting]

13:07.787 --> 13:10.331
That Croodling is out of control!

13:10.415 --> 13:11.749
My poor hair.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.793
Come on, it'll grow back.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.795
- Probably.
- [yelps]

13:15.878 --> 13:17.422
And my statue!

13:17.505 --> 13:18.840
And my wedding pelt.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.299
And my hand.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.302
She spit it out eventually.

13:23.386 --> 13:27.390
Sure, Sandy's feisty,
but that's who she is.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.473
- [growling]
- See?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.561
This is a game we play
called "Gnaw On My Face."

13:31.644 --> 13:32.979
Ow!

13:33.062 --> 13:36.232
[nervous laugh]
She plays for keeps, this one.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.358
[groans]

13:41.571 --> 13:42.655
[laughs]

13:42.739 --> 13:45.867
If you Croods can't
make your baby behave,

13:45.950 --> 13:48.995
I say she should be exiled
from the Valley!

13:49.078 --> 13:50.455
Now hold on.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.957
Sure, she's a handful, but exile?

13:53.041 --> 13:55.126
We only do that for true menaces,

13:55.209 --> 13:59.005
like that guy who went around
shouting that nonsense word "yolo."

13:59.088 --> 14:01.716
- [all shuddering]
- Well, I've had enough.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.885
- Who's with me?
- Banish the infant!

14:03.968 --> 14:06.512
- Who doesn't love a good exile?
- Yolo!

14:10.016 --> 14:11.642
Don't worry, baby.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.062
We won't let them exile you.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.521
[cooing]

14:17.398 --> 14:18.232
[growls]

14:18.316 --> 14:20.818
Heck, I don't know if you'd
let them exile you.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.612
We can get Sandy to behave.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.449
We just need to really enforce
the rules with her when she's bad.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.494
Sandy, you were a bad girl today,
so no Krispy Bear.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.454
[growling]

14:31.537 --> 14:32.538
No.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.917
You can have your baby bear
carcass back when you behave.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.502
[growls]

14:39.045 --> 14:40.671
[giggling]

14:40.755 --> 14:44.550
Uh, maybe just
think about what you did.

14:44.634 --> 14:49.013
[sighs] No, the problem is
you're all treating her like a kid.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.642
Children respond when you talk
to them on your level.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.853
Sandra, your conduct is unacceptable.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.688
You need to act more appropriately...

14:57.772 --> 14:58.981
- [groaning]
- [giggling]

14:59.065 --> 15:00.065
[groaning]

15:00.108 --> 15:01.192
Not appropriate!

15:01.275 --> 15:02.275
Now listen.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.695
Aah!

15:04.779 --> 15:07.323
Or... She doesn't know words,
does she?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.785
Oh, once again,
this whole family's clueless

15:10.868 --> 15:12.578
and only I have the answer.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.330
[giggling]

15:14.414 --> 15:15.790
Sandy's fine.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.710
We just gotta explain that
to everyone who wants to exile her,

15:19.794 --> 15:23.714
and as we do, Sandy
will creep up behind them and...

15:23.798 --> 15:25.883
- [growling]
- [giggling]

15:25.967 --> 15:28.469
[roaring]

15:29.303 --> 15:32.557
Oh, face it, Croods.
We're out of our league.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.142
What are we gonna do?

15:34.225 --> 15:35.476
[nails screeching]

15:35.560 --> 15:37.103
- [shouts]
- [shrieks]

15:37.770 --> 15:39.230
Y'all know Amber.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.399
Amber tame baby for you.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.609
But you're a savage hunter.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.070
I never figured you as good with kids.

15:46.154 --> 15:46.988
[growls]

15:47.071 --> 15:48.698
Children lot like prey.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.908
Show dominance, they succumb.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.243
Take Amber daughter.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.870
Pat!

15:55.079 --> 15:56.247
What, Mom?

15:56.330 --> 15:59.167
I was in the middle of making
another girl feel insecure.

15:59.250 --> 16:03.004
Amber hot.
Fan Amber now.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.839
What?
No.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.800
- You're not the boss of...
- [growls]

16:09.343 --> 16:11.679
Amber no see Pat smiling.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.056
[straining]

16:16.017 --> 16:17.351
[snickering]

16:17.435 --> 16:19.645
You tell no one about this.

16:19.729 --> 16:24.901
So, want Amber train baby
or prefer baby stay hopeless monster?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.611
Croods' call.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.196
I don't know.
She's intense.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.363
That stare.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.990
- [yelps]
- [growls]

16:31.073 --> 16:31.991
My eyes.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.618
They suddenly really wanna behave.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.496
Look, she is our best chance
to keep Sandy from being exiled.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.830
[sighs]
You're right.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.333
Amber, train baby.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.585
- [grunting]
- [laughs]

16:42.668 --> 16:45.254
It okay.
Amber not hurt baby.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.216
Just break baby's spirit like twig.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.052
[laughs]

16:51.135 --> 16:54.555
Two-to-one says the baby breaks
her by sundown.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.646
[gasps]

17:01.729 --> 17:03.147
[snarling]

17:10.946 --> 17:12.490
[panting, howling]

17:13.657 --> 17:15.076

17:20.373 --> 17:22.500

17:56.909 --> 17:58.786
[growling]

18:01.372 --> 18:02.372
[whimpers]

18:05.960 --> 18:09.213
Croods, Amber have good news
and bad news.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.424
Good news, baby tame.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.967
And the bad news?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.052
Not related to baby.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.680
Why Croods make everything
about Croods?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.476
Baby, sit.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.437
Good girl.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.354
[gasps]

18:25.438 --> 18:27.648
Shake.
Good girl.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.191
Club small prey.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.612
[shrieks]

18:34.405 --> 18:35.239
[yelling]

18:35.323 --> 18:36.741
Wow!

18:36.824 --> 18:38.534
She's a whole new baby.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.871
I can't wait to rub her progress
in Snoot's unnaturally pale face.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.788
[laughs]

18:42.872 --> 18:45.583
Amber even teach baby
to... clean!

18:49.253 --> 18:50.338
I don't know.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.965
She seems less...
Sandy.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.509
[slurping]

18:59.847 --> 19:02.266
[gasps] But Krispy Bear
is Sandy's friend.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.434
You don't eat friends.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.313
[grunts] Agree to disagree,
but this isn't our Sandy.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.190
Well, she may be different,

19:09.273 --> 19:14.403
but she's sure acting less exile-y now,
so that's good, right?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.364
[slurping]

19:21.869 --> 19:24.288
[shouting]

19:28.167 --> 19:32.004
All right, Croods, ready to say
goodbye to that pest baby of yours?

19:32.088 --> 19:35.633
Only thing we're ready for is
to show you we're not ready for that.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.051
I mean...

19:37.134 --> 19:40.012
He means Sandy is tame now.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.514
Watch.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.724
[laughs]
This'll be good.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.268
Shoo, shoo!
Your house is my hair now.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.361
Stay.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.405
Good girl.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.740
Ooh!

19:59.824 --> 20:00.991
Burp.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.870
- [belching]
- Aah.

20:04.954 --> 20:05.996
Dazzle.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.420
Good girl!

20:12.503 --> 20:13.629
[gasping]

20:13.713 --> 20:14.755
How...

20:14.839 --> 20:15.673
[chuckles]

20:15.756 --> 20:18.092
You must've
switched babies on us.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.176
[sniffs]

20:19.260 --> 20:21.137
No, that is Crood stink.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.681
Well, I have one final test for you.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.101
You recaptured the buffalippo?

20:27.184 --> 20:32.148
Yes, in that I pointed
and told seven hunters to get it for me.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.649
Five survived.

20:33.733 --> 20:38.654
Can you resist the mouth-watering allure
of his leathery hide?

20:38.738 --> 20:43.200
Bet it tastes good,
like raw meat on a hot, sunny day.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.577
[groans]

20:44.660 --> 20:46.328
- You're my hero!
- Go, Sandy!

20:46.412 --> 20:48.497
No, I know you're bad.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.291
Maybe you need a closer look.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.876
[groaning]

20:51.959 --> 20:53.335
[growls]

20:55.129 --> 20:57.006
[bellowing]

20:58.257 --> 21:00.551
See?
She made it escape.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.136
She hasn't changed.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.471
Exile!

21:03.554 --> 21:04.764
Yeah, exile.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.767
- 'Tis a wicked child.
- No way. You set her up.

21:07.850 --> 21:12.229
You're just mad 'cause she ruined that
pile of pigrat dung you call a hairstyle.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.858
How dare you!
My hairstyle is timeless.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.359
[Grug] Exiling a child is...

21:17.443 --> 21:20.654
- [voices overlapping]
- [rumbling]

21:21.864 --> 21:23.407
- [groaning]
- [chattering continues]

21:23.491 --> 21:24.992
[rumbling]

21:25.075 --> 21:27.578
Thank goodness Sandy took
a piece out of it!

21:27.661 --> 21:28.871
- Wish she took two.
- [gasps]

21:28.954 --> 21:30.414
[Snoot scoffs]
Jealous much?

21:30.498 --> 21:32.374
- [laughs]
- [Gran] Unbelievable.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.043
- [panting]
- She deserves to be exiled.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.503
- [growling]
- [groaning]

21:35.586 --> 21:37.046
Oh, my face!

21:37.129 --> 21:38.714
My soft, gorgeous face!

21:38.798 --> 21:40.633
- Sandy!
- There's my girl.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.343
[rumbling]

21:42.426 --> 21:43.511
[gasping]

21:48.224 --> 21:51.477
Sandy, you were just
leading us away to save our lives.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.978
Thank you.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.105
Well, let's get back to
exiling you away forever.

21:55.189 --> 21:59.944
Hey, after that, she clearly
deserves to stay, right, everyone?

22:00.027 --> 22:02.154
Most babies would've just let you die.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.574
We are never gonna eat
that buffalippo's dainty hooves.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.243
[sighs]
Fine.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.246
Just keep her away from the goods.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.915
- [birds cooing]
- I told you, you're homeless.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.917
Well, bonk.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.336
Haha, nice one, Sand.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.756
If it weren't for you,
we all would've been crushed horribly.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.466
I think this settles it.

22:22.550 --> 22:26.095
We should just let Sandy be Sandy.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.429
Hey, she bit Snoot.

22:27.513 --> 22:32.518
As far as I'm concerned,
my little girl can do no wrong.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.521
- [laughing]
- [howling]

22:35.604 --> 22:36.939
- [wailing]
- [mooing]

22:37.022 --> 22:38.732
Okay, that's enough.
You're drawing blood.

22:38.816 --> 22:39.650
[giggling]

22:39.733 --> 22:41.026
[belches]

22:41.110 --> 22:42.110
Yeah!
