00:01.667 --> 00:03.875
ADULT SHELDON:
Behind every great scientist,

00:03.875 --> 00:06.750
there were often unsung helpers
toiling away in the background.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.125
Presenting...

00:11.958 --> 00:14.458
When Alexander Graham Bell
needed an assistant,

00:14.458 --> 00:16.250
it was Thomas Augustus Watson

00:16.250 --> 00:18.292
who answered the call.
(laughs): Get it?

00:18.292 --> 00:19.708
"The call."

00:19.708 --> 00:20.958
(snickering)

00:20.958 --> 00:22.958
Madame Curie's daughter Irène

00:22.958 --> 00:24.958
was also her lab assistant.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.583
Irène was so dedicated,
she died of radiation poisoning.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.417
Unlike her sister Ève,

00:30.417 --> 00:33.000
who selfishly lived to 102.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.208
Lastly, Émile Roux was
assistant to Louis Pasteur.

00:36.208 --> 00:38.250
When they worked on
the rabies vaccine,

00:38.250 --> 00:40.500
Roux kept a loaded gun
in the lab

00:40.500 --> 00:42.833
to shoot Pasteur in the head
if he got infected.

00:42.833 --> 00:46.083
He never had to, but it's fun
to know he would have.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.333
LINKLETTER:
No, Sheldon.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.958
You can't be my lab assistant.

00:48.958 --> 00:51.083
Maybe you weren't
paying attention.

00:51.083 --> 00:51.958
I'll start over.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.708
Behind every great scientist,

00:53.708 --> 00:55.083
there was
a dedicated as...

00:55.083 --> 00:57.958
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

00:57.958 --> 01:00.833
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:00.833 --> 01:03.750
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:03.750 --> 01:05.708
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:05.708 --> 01:10.167
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

01:12.875 --> 01:14.292
LINKLETTER:
Son,

01:14.292 --> 01:16.542
lab assistants are
usually upperclassmen.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.625
I believe I've been
at this university

01:18.625 --> 01:20.000
long enough to be considered.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.292
You've been here two weeks.

01:21.292 --> 01:23.667
Hey, 16 days
if you count orientation.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.417
Sheldon, there's a waitlist
of students

01:26.417 --> 01:28.000
who've applied
for that position.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.750
I just can't give you
special treatment.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.250
Not with that attitude.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.750
Tell you what,
I'll think about it.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.333
Should I come back
or should I wait?

01:35.333 --> 01:37.042
Come back.
I'll wait.

01:37.042 --> 01:38.542
I thought about it. No.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.000
(The People's Court
theme music plays)

01:40.000 --> 01:41.667
Judgment for plaintiff
for $169.50.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.417
You think Judge Wapner
and Rusty the bailiff

01:44.417 --> 01:45.833
are friends
in real life?

01:45.833 --> 01:47.042
Yeah.

01:47.042 --> 01:48.958
You can't fake
that kind of chemistry.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.333
I'm flying!

01:52.333 --> 01:55.000
There you are!
Where have you been?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.250
We've been waiting for you.
What is this?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.792
That's the exercise guy
Meemaw likes.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.375
Sweatin' to the Oldies 2...

02:01.375 --> 02:04.458
I can't believe anyone pays
money to watch old people sweat.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.208
MISSY:
40 bucks?

02:06.208 --> 02:08.333
GEORGE JR.: They sold
over a million of those?

02:08.333 --> 02:10.000
At 40 bucks a pop?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.917
Do you know how much money
that must be?

02:11.917 --> 02:14.333
I'm not a calculator.

02:15.167 --> 02:20.583
40 times... one million.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.458
That's 40 million!

02:22.458 --> 02:24.417
Whoa.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.833
And then he said he wouldn't
give me special treatment.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.333
I think what he said is

02:28.333 --> 02:30.125
everybody should
be treated equally.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.583
I'm sorry, is this Russia?

02:31.583 --> 02:33.125
Should we get in line for bread?

02:33.125 --> 02:36.292
It's his lab, Sheldon.
He can do what he wants.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.500
(country music playing
over radio)

02:38.500 --> 02:39.708
I've got it.

02:39.708 --> 02:41.208
Dr. Linkletter likes you.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.625
You go on a date with him
and when he tries to kiss you,

02:43.625 --> 02:45.917
say you'll do it,
but only if he gives me the job.

02:45.917 --> 02:50.125
I'm gonna ask you to think hard
about what you just said.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.500
What? I want something,
he wants something--

02:52.500 --> 02:53.750
seems like a win-win.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.000
Not for me.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.208
You get a free dinner.

02:56.208 --> 02:57.833
Make him take you
someplace nice.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.000
Ooh, maybe Sizzler.
Sheldon.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.833
(TV playing indistinctly)

03:02.833 --> 03:04.375
What are you doing?

03:04.375 --> 03:06.708
Gonna make an exercise video.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.125
Why?

03:08.125 --> 03:10.125
If Richard Simmons could
make 40 million bucks,

03:10.125 --> 03:12.000
think how much I could make
with my face.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.167
What's your face
got to do with it?

03:14.167 --> 03:16.375
What do you mean?
I'm gorgeous, ask anybody.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.500
(door opens)
(sighs)

03:19.500 --> 03:22.667
ADULT SHELDON: Since my meemaw
was being stingy with her love,

03:22.667 --> 03:24.000
I had to find another way

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
to change Dr. Linkletter's mind.
(typing rapidly)

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I decided to treat this

03:27.000 --> 03:28.583
like a science experiment--

03:28.583 --> 03:30.458
test various methods
of persuasion

03:30.458 --> 03:32.708
to determine which
was the most effective.

03:32.708 --> 03:35.542
Dr. Linkletter, I was talking to
the other physics professors

03:35.542 --> 03:38.125
and they think you having
an 11-year-old lab assistant

03:38.125 --> 03:40.208
would be neat.
No.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.792
Don't you want your peers
to think you're cool?

03:43.792 --> 03:45.333
No.
I would.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.167
No.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.667
(knocks)
Dr. Linkletter?

03:48.667 --> 03:49.750
What?

03:49.750 --> 03:50.833
If you look in your drawer,

03:50.833 --> 03:52.250
you'll find
a little something.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.250
I hope you like
peanut butter cookies.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.875
This isn't going to
change my mind.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.667
You sure?
Yes.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.458
Then give them back,
they're my favorite.

04:03.708 --> 04:04.708
Say yes.

04:04.708 --> 04:05.792
No.
Yes.

04:05.792 --> 04:07.250
No.
Yes.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.667
No.
HIja.

04:09.667 --> 04:10.875
What?

04:10.875 --> 04:12.250
That's "yes" in Klingon.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.875
How do you say "no" in Klingon?

04:13.875 --> 04:14.833
Qo'.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.333
Qo'!

04:16.333 --> 04:17.833
Aw.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.125
I overheard some
of your other candidates

04:21.125 --> 04:22.917
talking about marijuana.

04:22.917 --> 04:24.792
(snack drops)
I don't care.

04:24.792 --> 04:25.958
Well, you should.

04:25.958 --> 04:28.125
I think they plan on smoking it.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.000
(Linkletter groans softly)

04:30.792 --> 04:32.500
You know what?
What?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.542
I was just admiring
your posture.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.500
You're not all hunched over
like most people your age.

04:40.458 --> 04:43.333
So, most people think
you need expensive machines

04:43.333 --> 04:44.792
to work out,

04:44.792 --> 04:46.667
but I just use free weights.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.833
To be clear, they ain't free.
You got to buy them.

04:48.833 --> 04:51.125
Are you watching
yourself work out?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.208
I made an exercise video.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.750
Why?

04:54.750 --> 04:56.042
To sell.

04:56.042 --> 04:57.708
That's very important.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.708
Next, we're gonna do curls.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.167
'Cause, like I always say,

05:01.167 --> 05:03.750
curls get the girls.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.500
Oh, Lord.
What?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.833
(sputters)
You want to remember:
squeeze it at the top.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.458
People like it
when things rhyme.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.792
(grunts on video)

05:10.792 --> 05:13.000
(phone rings)

05:14.792 --> 05:16.042
Hello?

05:16.042 --> 05:18.000
Can I be your lab assistant?

05:18.792 --> 05:20.500
What time is it?

05:20.500 --> 05:21.750
That's not a no.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.292
If I say yes, will you please
stop hounding me?

05:25.292 --> 05:26.833
Absolutely.
LINKLETTER: Fine.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.375
You win. Good night.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.000
Just out of
scientific curiosity,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.125
were you persuaded
by the disorienting nature

05:32.125 --> 05:33.667
of this late-night phone call

05:33.667 --> 05:35.500
or by the cumulative weight
of my relentlessness?

05:35.500 --> 05:36.583
That one.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.875
ADULT SHELDON:
I learned an important lesson
that night.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.417
When you want something,

05:42.417 --> 05:45.833
relentlessly annoying
is your road to victory.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.542
How may I assist you today?
Follow me.

05:53.542 --> 05:55.333
Should I look
over your notes?

05:55.333 --> 05:57.333
Would you like me to
double-check your math?

05:57.333 --> 05:58.958
See these bolts?

05:58.958 --> 06:00.375
Scrub the grease off.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.250
But there's hundreds of them.
Yes.

06:02.250 --> 06:03.750
That's where you come in.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.375
Surely there's a better use
of my intellect.
Son,

06:06.375 --> 06:07.750
we're building
a solar neutrino detector.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.375
If you don't want the job,
there's the door.

06:10.375 --> 06:11.958
No, I want it.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.750
Good man.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.167
(sighs) Although that door
does look tempting.

06:19.167 --> 06:20.542
So, I could really use your help

06:20.542 --> 06:22.417
making it look
more professional.

06:22.417 --> 06:23.667
That's burn right there.
(grunts)

06:23.667 --> 06:25.917
Like, adding a little,
you know...

06:25.917 --> 06:29.958
I think the word
you're looking for is "pizazz."

06:29.958 --> 06:32.167
Exactly. So, you'll do it?

06:32.167 --> 06:34.500
Well, I'm flattered
that you would ask,

06:34.500 --> 06:37.583
but exercise videos...

06:37.583 --> 06:40.250
That's not really what I do.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.958
But I've seen you on TV.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.708
I'm soft and firm

06:44.708 --> 06:47.083
in all the right places.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.417
You've been in plays.

06:48.417 --> 06:49.917
It's all right, Molly.

06:49.917 --> 06:52.083
Annie's here.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.958
Don't forget my modeling work.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.000
♪ ♪

06:56.000 --> 06:58.625
But I have a reputation.

06:58.625 --> 07:01.125
When people hear
the name Gene Lundy,

07:01.125 --> 07:02.750
they expect quality.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.792
They expect showmanship.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.958
(chuckles)
They expect me to get paid.

07:06.958 --> 07:08.583
Oh, I'm gonna pay you.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.750
Let's make an exercise video!
(chuckles)

07:11.750 --> 07:14.542
ADULT SHELDON:
While not the lab work
I hoped to be doing,

07:14.542 --> 07:17.917
it did feel good to be part
of an actual experiment.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.708
A tedious, menial part

07:19.708 --> 07:21.500
that could be performed
by a monkey.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.958
Or worse, an engineer.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.000
Here you go.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.125
473 grease-free bolts.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.500
(chuckles)
Excellent.
Now what?

07:31.500 --> 07:32.750
How about I help you design

07:32.750 --> 07:34.375
an even better
solar neutrino detector?

07:34.375 --> 07:36.708
Actually,
what I need you to do is...

07:36.708 --> 07:40.250
take this grease
and put it on these bolts.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.500
But I just took the grease
off the bolts.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.750
That was the wrong grease.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.750
This is the right grease.
Have at it.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.542
If this is some kind of test
to get me to quit,

07:49.542 --> 07:50.750
it's not going to work.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.250
I don't know what
you were expecting,

07:52.250 --> 07:53.833
but this is a menial job.

07:53.833 --> 07:57.042
After this, I need you
to sort a crate of resistors,

07:57.042 --> 07:59.708
strip a case of wire
and then sweep up.

07:59.708 --> 08:00.750
Oh.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.125
Then I quit.
(grease can thuds)

08:03.125 --> 08:05.167
Now, I like the idea

08:05.167 --> 08:06.708
of an exercise video.

08:06.708 --> 08:09.583
I'm just not sure that
weight lifting is the way to go.

08:09.583 --> 08:10.500
Why not?

08:10.500 --> 08:13.083
It's low-energy. You know?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.250
We don't want
a one-man show.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.833
We want Starlight Express.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.500
I don't know what that is.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.000
You'd love it.
Andrew Lloyd Webber,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.958
people on roller skates.

08:22.958 --> 08:24.958
That's a thought. Skater-cise.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.500
Do you... do you skate?

08:26.500 --> 08:27.583
No.

08:27.583 --> 08:28.625
Too bad.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.833
You sure
I can't just lift weights?

08:30.833 --> 08:33.042
Aerobics is the way to go.

08:33.042 --> 08:35.917
It's got music. It's got energy.
(snapping fingers)

08:35.917 --> 08:37.833
It's got what?

08:37.833 --> 08:39.875
Pizazz?
Bingo!

08:39.875 --> 08:41.500
Now, hear me out.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.917
We surround you
with a bunch of dancing girls.

08:44.917 --> 08:46.292
No, even better.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.500
The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.583
If that's what "pizazz" means,
I like it.
(chuckles)

08:52.417 --> 08:54.667
Of course, to do this right,

08:54.667 --> 08:57.250
we are gonna need
some financing.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.917
What does your father do
for a living?

08:59.917 --> 09:01.167
He's a coach here at the school.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.833
Oof.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.042
I know somebody who's got money.

09:05.042 --> 09:06.750
(doorbell rings)

09:07.750 --> 09:09.333
What do you two want?

09:09.333 --> 09:12.958
What we want is
to make you rich.

09:12.958 --> 09:15.333
Oh, God.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.917
What do you
mean you quit?
It was beneath me.

09:17.917 --> 09:20.625
You need to learn
there's nothing wrong
with a little hard work.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.708
Hard work is calculating
neutrino properties

09:22.708 --> 09:24.083
to one percent accuracy.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.875
Anyone can wash bolts.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.500
You begged him for that job.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.083
I assumed he'd realize
the value of my intellect

09:30.083 --> 09:31.708
and put it to good use.

09:31.708 --> 09:32.833
Hang on.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.292
You made a commitment.

09:34.292 --> 09:36.583
When you say you're gonna
do something, you do it.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.417
Well, he could find
someone else.

09:38.417 --> 09:39.833
Doesn't matter.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.708
This is about you being
a man of your word.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.083
ADULT SHELDON:
I wanted to point out that
I couldn't be a man of my word,

09:47.083 --> 09:51.750
since I hadn't hit puberty,
but he seemed pretty grouchy.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.125
GEORGE JR.:
You know how you love

09:53.125 --> 09:55.083
those Richard
Simmons tapes?

09:55.083 --> 09:57.042
Yeah.
Well,
what if I told you

09:57.042 --> 09:59.875
we have the next big thing

09:59.875 --> 10:02.250
in home fitness videos.

10:02.250 --> 10:05.958
Mm. And what kind of thing
would that be?

10:05.958 --> 10:08.375
"Cowboy aerobics."

10:08.375 --> 10:09.958
(quietly):
Yee-haw.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.292
It's like, um,

10:11.292 --> 10:12.583
Sweatin' to the Oldies

10:12.583 --> 10:13.833
with a little bit
of Southern swagger.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.083
(imitates gunshots quietly)

10:15.083 --> 10:16.250
Cool, huh?

10:16.250 --> 10:18.583
So, are y'all just

10:18.583 --> 10:20.500
trying to sell me
an aerobics tape?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.708
No.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.917
No, not at all.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.000
We want you to give us money
to make them.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.417
"Invest."
He... he means invest.

10:27.417 --> 10:31.750
And who would be, uh,
starring in this video?

10:31.750 --> 10:32.833
Me.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.958
(laughs) That's ridiculous.

10:34.958 --> 10:35.958
(chuckling)

10:35.958 --> 10:36.958
And Richard Simmons

10:36.958 --> 10:38.292
ain't ridiculous?

10:38.292 --> 10:40.375
Well, now,
the young man does have a point.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.500
Yeah, maybe on his head.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.167
Look, you're not getting
my money.

10:43.167 --> 10:48.167
Well, you are passing a-a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

10:48.167 --> 10:50.250
And how much lifetime
do you have left?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.333
That's not helping.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.250
No.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.292
All right, fair enough.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.708
Thank you for hearing us out.

11:01.708 --> 11:04.833
If you have a change of heart,
you let us know.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.292
Screw that.

11:06.292 --> 11:07.750
My whole life

11:07.750 --> 11:09.000
I've seen you bet

11:09.000 --> 11:10.417
on football games,

11:10.417 --> 11:13.208
throw away all kinds of money
at the track.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.875
If you want to gamble
on something,

11:15.875 --> 11:18.375
why can't it be
on your own grandson?

11:20.167 --> 11:22.292
How much money you need?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.292
Well, now, um...

11:25.292 --> 11:28.625
how much money did you bet
on football last year?

11:28.625 --> 11:31.375
(chuckles): Well,
you're not getting that much.

11:31.375 --> 11:33.833
(phone rings)
Hello?

11:33.833 --> 11:35.125
SHELDON:
Dr. Linkletter?

11:35.125 --> 11:36.583
(sighs) Sheldon Cooper.

11:36.583 --> 11:39.750
I'm calling to apologize.
I shouldn't have quit.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.542
I made a commitment,
and I need to see it through.

11:42.542 --> 11:45.750
I appreciate that,
but there's no need.

11:45.750 --> 11:49.875
There is. It's important to me,
as well as my father.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.750
Fine.
Excellent.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.958
Don't worry,
I won't overstep my bounds.

11:53.958 --> 11:56.500
I give you my word as a Texan.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Great.
And a man.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.375
Very good.
Well, a future man.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.083
At present, my hormones
and body hair aren't exactly

12:03.083 --> 12:05.083
what you'd call...
Good night.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.583
(dial tone)
Hmm.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.125
ADULT SHELDON:
The next day I returned

12:16.125 --> 12:17.875
to my role as lab assistant
with renewed vigor.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.167
Bolts were greased,

12:19.167 --> 12:20.917
wires were stripped,

12:20.917 --> 12:23.333
floors were swept,
all with a smile.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.833
It was a forced smile

12:24.833 --> 12:26.417
but you'd never know.

12:26.417 --> 12:28.500
I must say, Sheldon,
I'm impressed.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.833
I gave you my word
and I'm standing by it.
Well,

12:30.833 --> 12:33.500
I know it's not glamorous, but
all scientists pay their dues.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.917
And I'm happy to do it.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.042
Good man.
I understand
my role here.

12:37.042 --> 12:39.000
In fact, I noticed a flaw
in your reaction rates,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
but I kept it to myself
because I know my place.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.333
You really think
there's a flaw?
Oh, yes.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.542
What is it?

12:45.542 --> 12:47.333
I appreciate you testing me,

12:47.333 --> 12:48.583
but I'm not going to crack.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.042
I'm not testing you.

12:50.042 --> 12:51.708
Nice try.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.000
So, when are we gonna
shoot this thing?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.458
Slow down, now.

12:58.458 --> 12:59.958
We've got to plan out.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.458
You know, costumes,
choreography, music.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.167
Let's start with the set.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.625
Now, I was thinking...

13:05.625 --> 13:07.375
an Oklahoma theme.

13:07.375 --> 13:08.917
Hay bales, saloon door,

13:08.917 --> 13:11.292
maybe a surrey
with a fringe on top.

13:11.292 --> 13:12.500
A what with a what?

13:12.500 --> 13:13.917
Oh, you know.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.000

13:16.000 --> 13:18.500

13:21.250 --> 13:23.417
Okay, forget Oklahoma.

13:23.417 --> 13:24.417
Done.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.500
ADULT SHELDON: In an effort
to find out the mistake

13:27.500 --> 13:29.167
in his experimental design,

13:29.167 --> 13:32.875
Dr. Linkletter performed
his own experiment on me.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.708
You know, Sheldon, I don't even
care if you tell me the error.

13:35.708 --> 13:38.042
In fact, I'd rather
you keep it to yourself.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.458
All right.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.458
(quietly):
Yeah.

13:42.542 --> 13:45.375
I got you a little something
for all your hard work.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.833
It's about a little boy
who doesn't let being dead

13:47.833 --> 13:50.000
stop him from having fun.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.208
Thanks.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.542
(chuckles) Now that
I've given you something,

13:53.542 --> 13:55.083
perhaps you want
to reciprocate.

13:55.083 --> 13:58.583
Sure. You can have this.
I don't want it.

13:59.375 --> 14:02.000
(phone ringing)

14:06.625 --> 14:08.000
Hello?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.958
LINKLETTER:
Uh, may I speak with Sheldon?

14:09.958 --> 14:12.667
It's the middle of the night.
Who the hell is this?

14:12.667 --> 14:14.167
Uh, wrong number.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.792
(dial tone)

14:17.792 --> 14:19.458
LUNDY:
All right.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.083
(lively country music playing)
Let's try it again.

14:29.125 --> 14:33.375
I'm sorry, are-are we galloping,
or are we doing double Dutch?

14:33.375 --> 14:35.583
You got to get
your hips into it,

14:35.583 --> 14:36.833
All right?

14:36.833 --> 14:38.667
Yeah, you get your rope,
you get your hip.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.833
We can gallop up,
we can gallop back.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.667
We're lassoing
and galloping

14:42.667 --> 14:44.250
around the corral.
(knocking)

14:44.250 --> 14:46.250
Excuse me.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.333
We need to talk.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.625
Can it wait?

14:48.625 --> 14:50.208
I'm trying to turn
your grandson here

14:50.208 --> 14:52.333
into the Richard Simmons
of the Wild West.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.667
No, it can't. I took a look
at this contract you sent over.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.792
Oh, well, that's just
boilerplate legalese.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.375
I wouldn't even
read that.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.583
Too late.
I couldn't help but notice

15:01.583 --> 15:03.667
you're taking 80%
of the profits.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.500
Eighty percent?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.000
Well, in case

15:07.000 --> 15:09.458
no one has noticed,
I'm doing most of the work here.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.333
But it was all my idea.

15:11.333 --> 15:15.500
Your idea was lifting weights
in some dingy garage.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.500
Cowboy aerobics was hatched
in this egg right here.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.667
But it's my face.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.042
Any my money.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.792
And my apologies,

15:23.792 --> 15:26.458
but 20% is all you're getting.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.125
Unbelievable.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.042
Excuse me.

15:30.042 --> 15:32.167
I've done all the choreography.

15:32.167 --> 15:33.500
I designed the sets.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
I-I made the costumes by hand.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.833
You think
you can find

15:36.833 --> 15:39.083
sequined chaps in a mall?

15:39.083 --> 15:40.333
No, you cannot.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.167
And they give you quite the look
when you ask.

15:43.958 --> 15:45.583
Come on,
let's get out of here.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.208
Oh, fine, go ahead.

15:47.208 --> 15:49.542
And we're gonna make our own
exercise video without you.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.000
No, we're not.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.750
No, we're not!

15:54.500 --> 15:56.792
And they call me dramatic.

15:56.792 --> 15:59.792
ADULT SHELDON:
The next day, Dr. Linkletter
ran his experiment.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.708
I'm proud to say
I never broke my word,

16:02.708 --> 16:04.667
and he eventually
figured out the problem.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.167
(flames whooshing)
LINKLETTER: Fire!

16:06.167 --> 16:08.000
Fire!

16:08.000 --> 16:09.167
Fire!

16:09.167 --> 16:11.708
Was it too much oxygen
in the reagents?

16:11.708 --> 16:14.500
See? You didn't need my help
after all.

16:21.542 --> 16:24.583
ADULT SHELDON:
Mr. Lundy was undeterred.
He sought out new investors

16:24.583 --> 16:27.708
and new talent to bring
cowboy aerobics to life.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.125
LUNDY:
You've got the look.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.125
(chuckles):
You've got the physique.

16:31.125 --> 16:34.625
If-if we could secure a star
of your caliber,

16:34.625 --> 16:37.417
it would really put us
on the map.

16:37.417 --> 16:40.042
I do look good in a cowboy hat.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.458
You look good in everything.
(chuckles)

16:42.458 --> 16:44.333
Come on, Mr. Hasselhoff.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.625
Call me The Hoff.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.583
(chuckles):
Okay, The Hoff.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.250
So, what do you say?

16:49.250 --> 16:53.208
Well, I've conquered
television, music.

16:53.208 --> 16:56.750
I don't see why I couldn't add
exercise videos

16:56.750 --> 16:58.542
to my empire.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.125
So you'll do it?

17:00.125 --> 17:02.667
You got The Hoff!

17:02.667 --> 17:04.167
Hot damn! I got The Hoff!

17:04.167 --> 17:05.500
(both laugh)

17:05.500 --> 17:07.042
By-by any chance,

17:07.042 --> 17:09.458
do you know
what size chaps you wear?

17:09.458 --> 17:11.708
Oh. I got my own.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.333
Of course you do.
(chuckles)

17:14.333 --> 17:17.292
(whip cracks)
(lively country music playing)

17:17.292 --> 17:21.375
All right, buckaroos, it's time
for cowboy aerobics with...

17:21.375 --> 17:23.208
David Hasselhoff!
David Hasselhoff!

17:23.208 --> 17:26.667
Who's ready to rustle up
some muscles?

17:26.667 --> 17:29.667
(whooping)
Let's saddle up and ride.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.458
ADULT SHELDON:
Thanks to The Hoff,

17:31.458 --> 17:34.583
the video was
a smashing success.

17:34.583 --> 17:38.000
Who wants a beach body
like the ones on Baywatch?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.792
