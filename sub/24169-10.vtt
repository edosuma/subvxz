00:09.968 --> 00:13.138
That's it. If homicide detectives
start looking into our missing people,

00:13.221 --> 00:14.389
we're done.

00:14.764 --> 00:18.018
Maybe we'll be okay.
The storage units are under fake names

00:18.101 --> 00:20.395
and we've started to kill
outside of our friend circle.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.856
You're defrosting an elbow
in our microwave.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.400
-We are terrible murderers!
-[microwave beeps]

00:25.483 --> 00:27.944
Well, maybe they'll be
terrible detectives.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.946
We wouldn't survive
a terrible cleaning woman.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.323
So, what are you saying?

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
[sighs]

00:34.034 --> 00:36.077
We should think about leaving
before it's too late.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.914
-Leaving? Where would we go?
-I don't know.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.333
We'd just keep going
until we found someplace safe.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.294
[scoffs]
What about Abby?

00:44.377 --> 00:47.672
She's still in school.
She can't live like a fugitive.

00:48.047 --> 00:50.175
We could stop in Phoenix
and drop her at your sister's.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.887
Oh, my God.
You've really thought about this.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.514
Since the day you killed Gary.

00:56.598 --> 01:00.310
If we get caught,
we'll never see each other again.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.312
And if Abby's with us,
she could end up in prison, too.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.564
We don't have a lot of good choices.

01:05.398 --> 01:09.069
No, but we do have Gary.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.571
Right. I guess we'd take him with us.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.449
He's small and he knows a lot of jokes.

01:14.532 --> 01:18.828
No, I'm saying that Anne's theory is that
the same person killed Dan and Gary.

01:19.287 --> 01:23.124
But if we can prove
that Dan and Gary are alive,

01:23.208 --> 01:24.751
it destroys her case.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.087
So what are you suggesting?
We walk into a sheriff's office,

01:28.171 --> 01:29.756
hold up Gary's head and say
"Look, we're innocent.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.966
We killed this guy,
but he won't stay dead."

01:32.050 --> 01:33.718
Of course not.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.471
But sort of.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.431
[microwave dings]

01:49.609 --> 01:53.530
I want your opinion on my plan to blow up
the trailer on the fracking site.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.200
Really? You said you didn't want my input
'cause I'm not doing it with you.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.785
What was that animal
you compared me to?

01:58.868 --> 02:02.413
Was it a brave creature?
Oh, no, that's right, a mouse.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.376
-But we made up.
-I'm not sure you specifically apolog--

02:06.459 --> 02:08.128
-We made up.
-Thank you, I accept.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.840
Also my pride has been replaced
by how much I like my hands

02:11.923 --> 02:15.176
and how hard it would be to drive home
if my arms ended at my wrists.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.721
This is the explosive device
I'm thinking of using.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.432
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Ooh!

02:23.309 --> 02:24.227
Um...

02:25.520 --> 02:27.397
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I mean, this'll probably work.

02:27.605 --> 02:28.815
I'm thinking, with explosives,

02:28.898 --> 02:31.025
"this will probably work"
isn't where I wanna be.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.444
I mean, there are a couple of issues,
but nothing you can't fix.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.612
-When do you need it?
-Tonight.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.281
Oh, my God, you're gonna die.

They're having a press rollout tomorrow

to fuck the Earth with their toxic semen,

02:41.369 --> 02:44.497
so their trailer needs to be
a smoking hole in the ground by morning.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.583
Wow, you will never work
in corporate PR.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.920
Okay. Instead of transporting
and assembling these volatile materials,

02:51.004 --> 02:53.965
it'd be safer to use what's already there.
The trailer has propane tanks.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.800
Why not create a simple device
to explode those?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.135
Genius.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.555
Is there anyone in this room
who could build such a device?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.265
There is one person.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.309
Have I told that person
how much I love him?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.352
-No.
-As a friend?

03:06.811 --> 03:07.812
Constantly.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.856
Seriously, Eric, my hands thank you.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.941
Ha! Your hands.
That's cute.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.818
You would've been blown
so high into the stratosphere,

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
you'd come down as rain in Europe.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.328
So, using this burner phone,
you'll record a message to Dan.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.873
-Which is left on this burner phone.
-Neither of which are traceable.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.125
And we'll plant that phone
somewhere Anne will find it.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.211
"What's this? Why, it's a phone
that must've belonged to Dan."

03:32.587 --> 03:34.756
Curious, she'll listen to the voicemail.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.884
"I'm a cop. I wanna know everything.
It's so annoying."

03:37.967 --> 03:41.596
-[Sheila] She'll hear your message to Dan.
-"Oh, my, Gary and Dan are still alive.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.598
I should learn
to leave well enough alone."

03:43.681 --> 03:46.601
And her whole theory will implode.
Ba-boom!

03:46.684 --> 03:49.938
Or since it's imploding, boom-ba!

03:50.605 --> 03:52.148

Excuse me for wanting human contact.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.990
I was here yesterday.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.368
I scratched your ears
and we listened to <i>Quadrophenia.</i>

04:03.451 --> 04:05.995
-For 15 minutes.
-I had to visit a clam farm

04:06.079 --> 04:08.748
so the world wouldn't end,
and then get a rocket fired at me.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.959
I didn't say you're not important,
Mr. Big Shot.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.670
Okay, my morning was great, Gary.

04:13.753 --> 04:18.299
I went to the new Save 'n Save,
bought two burner phones, these bracelets,

04:18.383 --> 04:21.344
and a pair of barbecue tongs,
all for only $38.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.763
I love that you're a smart shopper,
and we did need new tongs.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.099
But since our lives depend on it,
I might not have bought

04:26.182 --> 04:28.351

-They're fine.

You're just upset 'cause you can't play
Flappy Dunk on them.

So, we're thinking something like,

04:32.897 --> 04:36.025
"Hey, Dan, it's Gary.
I'm on my way to Mexico to find you."

04:36.317 --> 04:37.986
"I have your laundered drug money.

04:38.069 --> 04:42.490
And please don't send another Serbian goon
to cut off a finger like you did before."

-But only if you can work it in.
-Try to work it in.

I'm just saying, if you load it up
with too much exposition...

04:50.415 --> 04:52.834
-It'll be better.
-Or it might not be believable.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.586
-Try to work it in.
-Or don't. Shall we?

Eric, it might not be now, but one day,
they're going to come for my mom.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.151
And when that happens,
our lives are over.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.654
So before this ends, I wanna know
that I was here, that I existed.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.406
I need to make a mark.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.409
-By destroying something?
-By saving something.

10:18.492 --> 10:22.163
And I don't have time
to wait for someone else to do it.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.583
I really admire your commitment
and steely resolve,

10:25.666 --> 10:27.168
but I wish you didn't have any of it.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.754
[footsteps approach]

10:29.837 --> 10:31.005
Someone's coming.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.387
Hey.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.097
-You see, 'cause it's blue...
-And green.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.349
And green.
That's how you know.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.434
-Eric, Abby.
-Hi.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.769
What are you guys doing?

10:46.270 --> 10:49.231
Eric has something
he wants to say to you

10:49.315 --> 10:52.026
on this, the holy day of Lisa's baptism.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.110
Eric?

10:55.529 --> 10:59.659
Today is my mother's baptism.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.787
It'll be sunny and warm,
high in the mid-90s.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.165
Ha! He's so shy.
I'll start him off.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.002
He just wants to say
how much he appreciates

11:10.086 --> 11:11.545
everything you've done for Lisa

11:11.629 --> 11:16.133
and how happy he is
that you're in their lives.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.426
-Okay, buddy?
-Okay.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.053
The rest is up to you.

11:22.014 --> 11:26.685
-I mean, she pretty much said it.
-Thank you, Eric. That's sweet.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.189
I love your mother,
and I think you're pretty great, too.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.233
Oh, well...

11:33.859 --> 11:35.403
Well, I'm just gonna grab
some sunscreen.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.740
Wait! Would it be weird
if I called you "Mother"?

11:40.408 --> 11:44.412
No, that is weird
and not at all necessary, but thank you.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.288
-[cell phone ringing]
-What the hell is that?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.876
Sounds like it's coming
from the closet.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.129
-Dan's closet?
-[ringing continues]

11:53.212 --> 11:56.006
What? That's impossible.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.514
-[people chattering]
-[police radio chatter]

12:06.225 --> 12:09.228
Wow. That's a lot of cops.

12:09.311 --> 12:12.648
It's going to be okay, honey.
Abby said Anne found the phone.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.609
We don't know if she heard
Gary's message, or if she ever will.

12:15.693 --> 12:19.321
Listen, if things go south,
we should have a panic word.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.615
-A panic word?
-Yeah. Something that if one of us says,

12:21.699 --> 12:23.659
the other will know
there's trouble and we have to go.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.246
A word we wouldn't ordinarily use,
like... halibut.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.999
-Halibut?
-It doesn't have to be halibut.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.002
I vote it's not.
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.880
We, mostly you, just need to be calm.

12:35.963 --> 12:39.216
-Look at how relaxed everyone is.
-Maybe none of them are murderers.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.469
That would free up
a lot of mental bandwidth.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.054
Or maybe they're just
all religious like Anne.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.557
She's never stressed out.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.852
Maybe we should join a church.
It could be good for us.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.355
Maybe. It would be nice to give
the weekend some structure.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.442
But right now, let's just get through this
and avoid that Bill Ramirez guy.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.779
-I know. Which one do you think he is?
-Hello. Bill Ramirez.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.574
Bill Ramirez!

13:03.657 --> 13:05.576
-Honey!
-I'm seeing him.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.369
I can tell by how you comport yourselves

13:07.453 --> 13:09.747
that you're the only people here
not in law enforcement.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.125
You got us.
We're the Hammonds.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.753
-This is my Joel husband.
-Dah!

13:15.836 --> 13:19.298
-She means, Joel, husband.
-Husband, Joel. There it is.

13:19.381 --> 13:24.220
And this is my wife, Joel. Wow.
Sheila. My wife, Sheila.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.515
And you're right, we're not
in law enforcement. We're "realators."

13:27.598 --> 13:30.392
So, Hammonds,
you guys knew Dan, right?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.062
We sure did.
He lived right next door.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.355
I thought he lived here.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.941
-Uh, next door to us, which is next door.
-To him.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.734
-Where he lived.
-Which is here.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.486
-Not there.
-Where we are.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.614
-Although, not now.
-No. Now we're over here.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.699
Hello. Hi.

13:46.825 --> 13:50.996
I'm gonna go put this down.
It was so nice to meet you.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.165
Yes.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.381
Jesus Christ, we just spent ten minutes
explaining the concept of "next door."

14:00.464 --> 14:02.716
What happened to you?
I'm the one that's shitty at this.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.759
I got nervous.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.303
He's a homicide detective
and we're homicide enthusiasts.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.846
It's not a good match.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.764
Hey.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.393
-We don't have to leave town.
-Wait, what?

14:12.768 --> 14:14.061
Anne heard the message from Gary.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.355
She was totally bummed,
said her whole case collapsed.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.691
She's canceling her meeting
with Bill Ramirez next week.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.653
-Oh, my God.
-We did it!

14:22.736 --> 14:25.322
We, mostly you,
are fucking masterminds.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.825
Unbelievable. Something you guys planned
actually worked.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.451
If this happens a thousand more times,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.245
I may have to rethink
my perception of you.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.624
I love it when you almost respect us.
I'm getting a drink. You need anything?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.794
Just to revel in my fucking glory.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.341
-Hey, guys.
-Hiya.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.802
Hey, Sheila. You look beautiful.

14:47.261 --> 14:50.306
I love those bracelets.
I can never wear anything like that.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.892
The Lord gave me these giant wrists.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.728
What are you talking about?
Your wrists are lovely.

14:55.811 --> 14:59.356
When Anne was a little girl,
her father told her she had man-wrists.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.860
-Totally fucked her up.
-Men are capable of such specific abuse.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.530
Anne, everything about you is beautiful,
inside and out.

15:06.989 --> 15:11.243
And that goes for all of you.
You are awesome, strong, loving women,

15:11.327 --> 15:14.830
and I am so grateful
that we are all gonna get to be friends

15:14.914 --> 15:16.707
for the rest of our lives.

15:16.790 --> 15:20.085
-That's so sweet.
-Hello, ladies. How's everyone's day?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.671
Oh, great now.
It was pretty sucky earlier.

15:22.963 --> 15:27.384
Really? That's terrible.
I'm sorry that happened, whatever it was.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.178
Anne found an old phone of Dan's.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.847
There was a message on it from Gary,
who's still alive.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.474
-Get out!
-Holy cow!

15:33.557 --> 15:35.184
[Lisa] Right? And Dan's in Mexico.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.686
Probably getting his dick fixed.
That man was all kinds of crooked.

15:38.646 --> 15:43.651
Anyway, because of that voicemail,
Anne's entire theory imploded.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.444
Boom-ba!

15:47.613 --> 15:49.156
Because it's an implosion.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.577
I'm sorry, Anne.
But the important thing is is you tried.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.663
And now you can stop trying.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.332
At least I found more evidence
that Dan was a dirty cop.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.168
I sent the phone to our tech guy
to see what else he could get off of it.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.879
Texts, deleted voice messages, emails--

16:03.963 --> 16:05.839
-Hang on.
-Yeah, hang on.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.384
Did you say deleted voice messages?

16:08.467 --> 16:10.970
Because they're deleted,
which means they're gone,

16:11.053 --> 16:14.098
so why are we even talking about it?
Goodbye. End of story.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.683
Actually, most people don't know this,

16:15.766 --> 16:18.477
but phone companies store
deleted voice messages for a few days

16:18.560 --> 16:21.313
in case a customer wants to retrieve one
or law enforcement wants to listen.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.775
-I did not know that.
-[Lisa] I didn't either.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.276
Me neither.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.531
So, did your bisexuality sneak up on you
or did it burn inside you for a long time?

16:30.614 --> 16:33.784
Who cares? What is it with you
and missing people, anyway?

16:33.867 --> 16:35.327
It's like you're obsessed.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.788
Well, solving crime is my calling, Joel.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.833
I believe I serve God
by bringing evildoers to justice.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.919
Halibut. I want halibut.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.505
I'm going to the food table
to see if there's halibut.

16:48.799 --> 16:54.096
Sometimes he craves really good whitefish.
Everyone says it's okay.

16:58.767 --> 16:59.768
[Sheila sighs]

17:00.185 --> 17:02.604
We are not acting normal,
mostly you.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.482
Everything is on those deleted messages.
Everything!

17:05.566 --> 17:07.443
That I killed Dan, that you ate Gary...

17:07.526 --> 17:10.779
Well, we just have to figure out
a way to erase them.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.780
We can't erase them.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.824
-There must be something we can do.
-Sheila.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.659
-Someone that can help.
-Sheila!

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
There's nothing we can do.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.581
They're going to find them,
maybe even today, and arrest us.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.957
We have to get out now!

17:23.250 --> 17:25.294
I can't. This is our home.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.629
Honey, it's over.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.845
Go home and start packing.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.723
I'll go to the storage unit
and get enough food to go on the road.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.766
We'll leave in an hour.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.226
-What about Gary?
-I'll get him, too.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.647
And if he still wants to die,
then we can do it on our way out of town.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.942
I'll call my sister and tell her
that we're bringing Abby.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.738
We'll be okay, honey.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.365
And when we get settled,
we'll send for her.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.743
We'll be a family again.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
I know.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.040
And let's not tell her about your sister
until we're on the road.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.168
Yeah. Abby's gonna have
an opinion about that.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.711
[Abby] Opinion about what?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.050
Oh, God.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.677
What's going on?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.680
The phone thing didn't work.
It made it worse.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.890
Oh, no.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.975
-My family's leaving.
-Leaving?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.560
-When?
-In an hour.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.104
-Jesus.
-Eric, listen.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.023
We're gonna keep knowing each other, okay?
We're just taking a break.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.193
-I wanna go with you.
-You can't. You know that.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.406
I have to go.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.451
Okay.

18:41.745 --> 18:42.663
Should we kiss?

18:42.996 --> 18:45.207
I feel like if we kiss,
I'll never see you again.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.333
Yeah.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.210
Let's kiss anyway.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.891
Well, we did that.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.853
Yes, we did.

19:07.062 --> 19:07.896
What?

19:09.022 --> 19:11.692
I'm gonna blow
that fracking trailer up tonight.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.653
-My tribute to you.
-Oh, cool. Thanks.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.073
You mean,
"Eric, you don't have to do that."

19:18.157 --> 19:21.118
-No, it's great.
-Abby, I'm doing it.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.202
Mm-hmm.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.002
Gary's in a bowling ball bag in the car,
so, glad we're finally using that.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.837
Abby's pulling camping stuff
out of the garage.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.174
-How's it going in here?
-Good. Your stuff's in that bag.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.678
You packed me, like, all my lingerie.
No shoes or pants?

19:39.761 --> 19:44.349
Did I? I'm panicking, so my lizard brain
is making a lot of the decisions.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.978
Listen, we may not have time
to discuss this again.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.314
If we get caught...

19:50.397 --> 19:54.359
Honey, I'm the one responsible
for this, so I--

19:54.443 --> 19:57.196
It has to be me.
Do you understand?

19:57.279 --> 20:00.365
If they find out what you are,
you won't even get to prison.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.326
So, please, I need you to promise,

20:02.409 --> 20:04.620
if it comes to it,
you'll let me take the blame.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.790
I promise.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.878
Okay, good. So, socks.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.299
-Three pairs or all of 'em?
-Aunt Kathy called.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.676
She said something
about getting a room ready for me.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.139
-Right. We were gonna tell you.
-Yeah, we're not doing that.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.142
We don't even know where we're going.
We might be living on the road.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.519
Hey, we're a family.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.521
If you fuckers
try to leave me somewhere,

20:31.605 --> 20:34.066
I will track you down
and give you so much shit,

20:34.149 --> 20:36.360
it'll make the time you didn't take me
to see One Direction

20:36.443 --> 20:38.320
feel like a walk in the goddamn park.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.990
I told you she'd have an opinion.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.952
[Joel sighs]

20:45.035 --> 20:46.328
All right. Go pack.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.039
Please. I've had my go-bag ready
since you killed Gary.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.958
By the way,
you're taking too much stuff.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.752
Also, you should go to the bank
and withdraw as much cash as you can

20:53.835 --> 20:55.337
before they freeze your accounts.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.342
What were we thinking?
We're so gonna need her.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.888
[Gary] I agree with Abby.
It feels like too much stuff.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.056
-Thank you.
-[Sheila] Yeah.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.267
And why are we bringing
the toaster oven?

21:08.350 --> 21:10.185
-We just bought it.
-Hey, guys.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.312
[both gasp]

21:13.146 --> 21:14.523
What's up?
You going on a trip?

21:15.148 --> 21:18.443
No, no. We're just donating
a bunch of things to Goodwill.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.488
We were so inspired by Lisa's baptism.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.740
It was beautiful.
I didn't see you guys after.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.744
-We ran home to give our things away.
-That's right. It all connects.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.329
All our ducks, right in a row.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.499
Well, I just wanted to come over
and thank you for what you said

21:32.582 --> 21:34.042
about always being friends.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.545
I was feeling pretty bummed
about my case falling apart,

21:36.628 --> 21:38.797
and you reminded me
what's really important.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.342
Well, I'm so glad. I really meant it.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.721
I'm just really thankful that God
brought you into my life.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.682
I am, too, Anne.

21:48.765 --> 21:53.145
Here. I want you to have these.
For your beautiful wrists.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.857
Wow, thank you so much, Sheila.

21:57.524 --> 22:01.403
Hey, you know, as long you're giving
stuff away, could I have this guitar?

22:02.446 --> 22:03.280
My guitar?

22:03.572 --> 22:05.115
I've always wanted to learn how to play.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.785
-Okay.
-Great, thanks.

22:08.869 --> 22:12.581
Oh, are these men's clothes?
My brother would love this stuff.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.875
He's been a little down
on his luck lately.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.378
-Okay.
-Great. Thanks.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.088
-[cell phone chiming]
-Oh.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.383
Oh, it's my tech guy.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.927
Hey, Steve.
What'd you find on Dan's phone?

22:27.512 --> 22:28.472
Uh-huh.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.684
Uh-huh. Wow.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.270
Are you sure about that?

22:39.649 --> 22:42.069
[Anne] Okay. Thanks.

22:44.488 --> 22:48.575
-Well, it's all over, guys.
-I'm gonna throw up.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.745
They couldn't find anything.
Did you just say you were gonna throw up?

22:51.828 --> 22:52.913
It can wait. Go on.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.957
Well, it turns out Dan was using
a super cheap burner phone

22:56.041 --> 22:58.376
and the company doesn't keep
deleted voice mails.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.420
-[Joel] Really?
-[Sheila] Wow!

23:00.504 --> 23:04.674
Dan is a pretty brilliant criminal,
buying the cheapest phone he could find.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.051
God, I love him.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.598
I mean the same way
I love Hitler or Stalin.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.350
They were all babies once.

23:14.851 --> 23:18.522
Okay. Hey, maybe I'll snag
this toaster oven, too.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.232
Lisa could use a new one.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.278
Could you just stuff your clothes
under my arm here?

23:25.362 --> 23:26.863
I'm running out of hands.

23:28.156 --> 23:31.201
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.870
[Sheila sighs]

23:35.872 --> 23:39.167
-So we're staying?
-Yeah. We're safe.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.254
She took all my stuff.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.965
-Yeah, we're lucky she's not a bowler.
-[Gary] Speaking of which,

23:45.048 --> 23:48.802
I'd love to get out of this bag
and stretch my... face.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.347
You got it, buddy.
Let's run back to the storage unit.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.768
We can try soaking your neck in whiskey
like you wanted, see if you get a buzz.

23:56.852 --> 24:00.856
[Gary] Actually, Joel,
I still want you to kill me tonight.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.824
-Abby.
-We're not leaving.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.117
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.911
-You guys are getting our toaster oven.
-Okay.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.331
So, I can do this tonight.
You don't have to anymore.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.333
It'll be safer if I go with you.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.838
I lost you once today.
I don't wanna lose you again.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.966
Okay. We'll leave
as soon as it gets dark.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.177
Yes, I'm sure.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.430
You think this is enough C4?

24:33.513 --> 24:35.307
That on a propane tank?

24:35.390 --> 24:37.100
It'll light up the sky
from here to Fresno.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.352
Great. Let's take more.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.898
-So you wanna talk about the kiss?
-I don't think so.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.025
Cool. Don't need to.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.364
When I first met Gary West,
I was not a fan.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.533
Oh, the feeling was mutual, my friend.

24:54.534 --> 24:59.122
But now, though he's only ten inches tall,
I look up to him.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.631
[bracelets jangling]

25:10.050 --> 25:11.092
Son of a...

25:15.889 --> 25:19.267
I'll never forget the night
we thought Sheila killed Carl.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.020
I found myself
in the storage unit with Gary.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.565
I was pretty upset
until he shared this story

25:25.649 --> 25:29.861
about the time he saw Paul Shaffer
at a car wash holding this super tiny cat

25:30.403 --> 25:34.824
that somehow Gary, knucklehead,
thought was a woman's glove.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.202
Its legs looked like
furry little fingers.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.289
Why would he be cradling
a woman's glove?

25:41.373 --> 25:44.042
I thought he was sad
because he lost the other one.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.339
-It makes no sense!
-Classic Gary. So funny.

25:49.422 --> 25:52.008
We could go on all night,
and almost have.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.221
-Right.
-Ah.

25:57.013 --> 26:00.433
[Joel] Gary, you've been
someone I can talk to,

26:00.517 --> 26:04.104
someone who listens,
who has opinions,

26:04.187 --> 26:05.689
especially when it comes to baseball.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.441
-Ugh, fucking Padres.
-Who roots for the Padres?

26:08.525 --> 26:11.486
-I'm from San Diego!
-Maybe I'll come back and pick you up.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.405
[Gary] No, no, no, let's do it.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.198
Come on, right now, quick and clean.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.121
Yeah.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.209
We got this a couple weeks ago
when we thought we needed it for me.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.419
It's pretty, isn't it?

26:27.502 --> 26:30.714
We thought you might enjoy
being shot with it through a silk pillow.

26:30.797 --> 26:31.798
Oh!

26:32.799 --> 26:34.801
You guys are the best.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.013
I mean, sure, you disemboweled me
and buried me alive,

26:38.096 --> 26:39.431
but after that...

26:40.265 --> 26:43.268
you really stepped up.
I'm gonna miss you both.

26:44.728 --> 26:45.937
Bye, Gary.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.027
Aw.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.446
-Bye, buddy.
-Goodbye, Gary.

27:02.037 --> 27:02.871
[gun clicks]

27:13.340 --> 27:14.507
[Joel sighs]

27:16.134 --> 27:17.135
I can't.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.596
[Gary chuckles]

27:19.679 --> 27:22.265
You worried about killing
half the world's Padres fans?

27:26.227 --> 27:27.228
Can you do it?

27:36.529 --> 27:38.865
One, two...

27:39.240 --> 27:40.658
Cha-cha-cha.

27:42.077 --> 27:45.288
You're right. It's too hard.
It feels wrong.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.624
[car engine humming]

27:48.458 --> 27:49.292
[both gasp]

27:49.376 --> 27:50.960
-Someone's coming!
-Oh!

27:51.044 --> 27:52.754
Hide the head!
Hide the fucking head!

27:53.380 --> 27:55.048
-I have a name.
-Shit!

28:12.565 --> 28:14.025
If you're gonna bury someone out here,

28:14.109 --> 28:16.986
you should turn your cell phones off
so they can't be tracked.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.072
What?

28:19.155 --> 28:20.240
That's crazy.

28:20.323 --> 28:23.243
I don't know what you're talking about,
even a little.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.953
[bracelets jangling]

28:25.662 --> 28:28.164
I realized I heard that sound somewhere.

28:30.917 --> 28:34.295
-[cell phone beeps]
-[Gary] <i>We did it, buddy. We're rich.</i>

28:34.379 --> 28:35.713
[bracelets jangling]

28:41.594 --> 28:43.805
It was on Gary's voice message.

28:44.597 --> 28:49.227
You guys were there when he recorded it.
It all makes sense now.

28:49.728 --> 28:54.107
Why Joel's always nervous around me,
your obsession with my case,

28:54.190 --> 28:56.860
even why you were loading up
your car today.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.862
You guys killed Dan.

28:59.195 --> 29:03.491
Why else would you try so hard
to make me think he was alive?

29:03.950 --> 29:05.368
You're both murderers.

29:05.910 --> 29:06.953
No.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.080
Not both of us.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.331
-Just--
-Me.

29:11.916 --> 29:15.545
-What are you doing?
-If I go away, Abby lives with you,

29:15.628 --> 29:19.632
and she has a chance at a normal life.
If you're gone, she'll never have that.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.302
But you promised.
It was gonna be me.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.596
Joel.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.681
It was always gonna be me.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.061
No.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.357
We're leaving, Anne.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.319
And if you happen to have my guitar,
I'll take that, too.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.405
You're never getting that guitar.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.824
And you're also not leaving.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.993
Guys, come on. Put the guns down!

29:47.076 --> 29:50.288
Your lady weapon is only good
from about five feet away, Joel.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.624
-Then I'll move closer.
-Then I'll shoot you.

29:55.543 --> 29:58.004
-You're not gonna shoot me.
-I will shoot you.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.051
I don't know her <i>that</i> well.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.765
-You're not gonna shoot me.
-I will shoot you.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.684
-You're not gonna shoot--
-Oh, my God, new plan!

30:11.768 --> 30:13.186
[Sheila shouting]

30:16.314 --> 30:18.233
Okay, you shot me.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.401
It's your training. I'm not mad.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.695
How-- how--? What--?

30:23.238 --> 30:27.534
Anne, I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Then I'm hoping you're gonna let us go.

30:27.617 --> 30:31.871
-I can't let you go.
-I died and then I came back to life.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.207
And now I hunt people to survive.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.376
But only bad people.

30:36.459 --> 30:39.921
In a way, it's like what you do,
only we're volunteers.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.216
-That's impossible.
-You just shot her.

30:43.299 --> 30:46.803
-You can shoot her again if you want.
-Yeah, you can totally shoot--

30:49.639 --> 30:50.723
Whoa.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.601
Anne does not have a problem
shooting people.

30:56.521 --> 31:00.775
So... you've risen from the dead?

31:01.693 --> 31:06.114
And-- and you're doing God's work
by ridding the world of evildoers?

31:06.197 --> 31:07.532
Is that what you're saying?

31:12.287 --> 31:15.415
-It's not not what we're saying.
-That-- that can't be true.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.041
-This is a trick.
-[Joel] A trick?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.919
Then how do you explain this?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.259
Behold!

31:26.926 --> 31:28.845
Hi. Gary West.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.138
[screaming]

31:30.388 --> 31:33.892
-She can grant eternal life!
-Eternal!

31:34.225 --> 31:36.728
Oh, Lord! Help me.

31:37.854 --> 31:41.524
Is it true?
Have You chosen Sheila to do Your work?

31:41.608 --> 31:44.110
Unlikely, but seems to be true.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.737
[Anne] Help me understand, Lord.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.740
If this is Your doing, show me a sign.

31:48.823 --> 31:49.991
[distant explosion]

31:58.333 --> 31:59.334
Praise be.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.629
You are His instrument.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.508
This makes me a little uncomfortable.

32:07.967 --> 32:10.053
You did say you wanted
to get more into religion.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.097
I know, but I didn't wanna start one.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.225
How may I serve you?

32:17.060 --> 32:19.437
Well, this just got fucking weird.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.398
[explosion]
