18:18.765 --> 18:20.308
Now, I should warn you,

18:20.391 --> 18:22.853
I was on my prep school's
shadow-boxing team.

Take that.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.206
Fine, I'll just kick you
with the other foot then.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.624
Oh, yeah?
Go ahead, do it.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.334
I'm going to.
Watch.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.879
Well, quit talking about it
and do it already.

I assume you're talking
about the tennis score there

O-okay.

to be an adult,

'cause you did it.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.172
What are you talking about?

19:33.256 --> 19:34.841
My birthday was a disaster.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.593
Exactly.
What happened tonight?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.177
Your family upset you,

19:43.141 --> 19:44.809
Yeah?
Psht, what?

19:44.893 --> 19:47.353
You made a scene
in front of everyone.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.981
And now you're crying,
thinking about the passage of time.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.357
Life is so short.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.943
Girlfriend,
you just had yourself

19:53.026 --> 19:55.403
an adult birthday party.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.571
Being an adult is terrible.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.031
Tell me about it.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.657
In my next life,
I'm coming back as a baby.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.411
Thanks, Titus.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.955
You're welcome,
Titus's friend.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.584
So can I hear the song
you wrote for me?

20:09.667 --> 20:12.087
Oh, yeah.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.880
It's not very good.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.841
Come on, it can't be any worse
than the stuff you played at the party.

20:16.925 --> 20:20.971
Right. All those songs
from the last 15 years you didn't know.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.680
Here's my song...

Wow, that's very catchy.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.123
- Some constructive criticism.
- What?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.500
I don't think anyone says
"a firework" singular.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.585
- It's "fireworks."
- Hmm.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.838
Also, "work" doesn't rhyme
with "burst."

21:36.921 --> 21:39.674

compare me to a plastic bag,

Where is Kymmi?

Oh, I am such a mess-up, Kimmy.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.232
I never found you.
I lost your mom.

I let that stupid
sign language-talking gorilla

from the Durnsville Zoo.

And that's why I'm just trying
to make everything right.

but you and Kymmi are sisters.

And she really needs somebody
she can look up to.

know what I'm doing either.

that you hate your life,
