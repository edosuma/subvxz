00:24.441 --> 00:25.859
Do you feel much pain?

00:27.069 --> 00:28.487
Just some aching.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.578
It's time.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.512
Nothing.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.558
-Nothing!
-Father. Father.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.935
-I can't see.
-It's okay. Stay calm.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.521
-Oloman, it didn't work.
-Father, please.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.817
We'll try it again.
The procedure, do it again. Try it again.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.236
I'm sorry.
There's nothing more to be done.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.864
You're wrong! There must be.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.616
-Oloman.
-Father.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.535
You have to keep reading.
All of the medical books, everything.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.828
The answers will be there.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.206
Father, I have read all the books.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.667
And what they tell me is that your corneas
have been damaged beyond repair.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.336
You're not looking hard enough!

02:09.963 --> 02:12.007
I will not be blind.

02:13.509 --> 02:14.760
Do you hear me?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.804
I will not be blind!

04:20.886 --> 04:21.887
What?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.311
What?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.206
Don't get any ideas.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.147
Lieutenant Commander Wren.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.524
Yes, Lieutenant.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.651
Open the gate!

05:17.734 --> 05:18.902
Yes, sir!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.785
And so…

06:09.369 --> 06:14.875
the great Trivantian, Toliver,
wounded but not dead…

06:17.044 --> 06:22.216
pulled himself to his tired feet
and mounted his horse.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.971
Although thunder and rain…

06:28.055 --> 06:30.098
dampened his senses,

06:30.182 --> 06:34.937
he guided his tired men through
the tall grass of the Bloody Plains…

06:36.480 --> 06:38.065
to the Ganite stronghold.

06:38.941 --> 06:43.153
Under his command, 20 Trivantian soldiers…

06:43.695 --> 06:46.240
held the Ganite hordes at bay…

06:47.324 --> 06:48.450
all through the night...

06:48.909 --> 06:53.830
and into the next morning until
the battalions arrived to turn the tide.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.475
Where are you taking me?

07:14.184 --> 07:15.227
You'll see.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.289
I've never been so high up before.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.374
Yeah?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.586
When I was younger,
I used to climb all these towers.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.758
They were the only places I felt safe
being sighted.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.804
Guess I loved going
where I knew no one else could come.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.139
And that's how I found this place.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.686
I've taken care of it ever since.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.155
People used to celebrate their sight.

09:32.948 --> 09:37.870
We make art to be heard
or felt or smelled.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.332
Everything in their world
was meant to be seen.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.172
-People too.
-What?

09:50.549 --> 09:52.509
We were meant to be seen too.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.377
This one was my favorite.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.551
I used to make up stories
about the girl in the pictures.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.557
I named her Gwendolyn.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.812
Her name is Alice.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.275
You can read.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.790
The book is called Alice in Wonderland.

11:10.921 --> 11:15.384
"Alice was beginning to get very tired
of sitting by her sister on the bank

11:16.051 --> 11:17.845
and of having nothing to do."

11:18.470 --> 11:21.723
"Once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading,

11:21.807 --> 11:24.434
but it had no pictures
or conversations in it."

11:24.518 --> 11:25.686
No!

11:26.687 --> 11:29.606
"'And what is the use of a book,'
thought Alice,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.277
'without pictures or conversations?'"

11:34.820 --> 11:36.071
Stop.

11:42.911 --> 11:48.000
Big brother, you are holding up well.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.764
Your marks are nothing compared
to the scars you left on my back.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.772
What have you done with Haniwa?

12:11.732 --> 12:12.941
Haniwa?

12:15.027 --> 12:17.070
You fear for your daughter.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.830
Fear is worse than the pain, isn't it?

12:31.293 --> 12:33.337
It was like that for me as a boy.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.217
The pain you inflicted on me

12:39.343 --> 12:44.389
wasn't nearly as great as the fear
of knowing it was coming,

12:45.474 --> 12:47.392
that you were coming.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.813
And I promise you,

12:51.897 --> 12:56.568
Haniwa will know that same fear
every night, as I did.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.701
Edo, please just let her go.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.621
You were my brother.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.207
I'm still your brother. I'm sorry.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.376
I should've protected you.
But I was forced--

13:12.459 --> 13:17.130
You don't know what sorry is. Not yet.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.550
But you will.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.302
'Cause I will keep you here…

13:23.512 --> 13:26.557
and whip you every night
for every night you whipped me.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.684
And years from now,

13:29.601 --> 13:31.687
when I finally decide to kill you,

13:33.814 --> 13:36.108
you will weep with gratitude.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.236
Keep him conscious.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.363
-Edo.
-I want him to feel every lash.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.283
No. Edo, just let her go.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.120
Edo. Edo!

13:49.705 --> 13:50.706
Edo!

13:52.624 --> 13:55.294
Edo, no! Let her go!

13:55.961 --> 13:57.421
Edo!

14:19.985 --> 14:20.986
Tak.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.532
We'll stop just long enough to piss
and fill our canteens.

14:25.616 --> 14:26.617
Yes, sir.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.497
I wanna wash up.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.334
I don't want you near my men.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.628
They're hungry and tired,

14:38.295 --> 14:41.673
and they're not fond of witches
under the best of circumstances.

14:41.757 --> 14:42.758
Come on.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.391
How many witches
have you talked to before?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.519
None before you.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.273
If I'm the first, how do you know
we're something to be feared?

14:58.357 --> 15:02.986
People like you destroyed the old world
with your machines and your poisons.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.239
Your kind were responsible
for the deaths of millions.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.699
And you for the death of thousands.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.328
You wiped the Alkenny…

15:12.955 --> 15:15.541
my tribe, off the face of the earth.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.544
They knew the price for harboring witches.
It was the law of the kingdom.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.588
You killed children. Babies.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.757
I wasn't there.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.843
And what would you have done if you were?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.681
I'm the witch.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.433
Who's murdered more people? You or me?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.573
My queen,

15:47.656 --> 15:51.952
I present to you the greatest minds
of Pennsa, your council of state.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.705
My council of what?

15:55.873 --> 15:58.625
Your council of state, my queen.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.129
To advise you,
to execute your commands.

16:02.212 --> 16:07.509
We are here to assemble not
a council of state, but a council of war.

16:08.635 --> 16:13.015
Majesty, protocol requires
that a council of war be assembled

16:13.098 --> 16:15.392
following an official declaration of war.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.604
He is going to school me in protocol.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.315
War was declared on us.

16:21.857 --> 16:26.653
Captain Gosset, I worry
that you don't grasp the stakes here.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.989
Rest assured, I do, Majesty.

16:29.781 --> 16:33.493
And everything I say here
is with all due respect

16:33.577 --> 16:35.454
and in accordance with your wishes.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.582
If we are to withstand
the might of the Trivantian army,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.793
we must shore up our defenses
across the kingdom.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.837
-Captain Gosset--
-Defenses?

16:44.379 --> 16:49.801
We have been charged by God
to defeat the Trivantians.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.262
We must prepare to attack, not defend.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.931
-Sibeth--
-Who?

16:56.350 --> 16:59.228
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

17:00.646 --> 17:04.983
Princess Maghra,
if you have something to say, then say it.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.945
Paya has been weakened
by the loss of Kanzua

17:10.030 --> 17:12.866
and the chaos
in the wake of your presumed death.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.410
We just consecrated a new capital.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.748
Perhaps we should spend some time
tending to our kingdom,

17:19.829 --> 17:21.834
organizing and fortifying our armies

17:21.915 --> 17:26.171
while, of course, remaining vigilant
to the threat from Trivantes.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.887
Everyone… out.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.142
Out!

17:57.452 --> 17:58.620
Sibeth--

18:00.622 --> 18:02.583
Did you hear what just happened?

18:05.127 --> 18:06.128
What?

18:07.421 --> 18:11.550
A room full of people
quietly questioning my authority,

18:11.633 --> 18:15.387
wondering if, in fact,
they're even bound by it anymore.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.683
A captain who argues with me.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.271
Politicians
entertaining treasonous thoughts,

18:24.354 --> 18:29.067
all of which end with our heads
removed from our bodies

18:29.151 --> 18:31.987
and our royal bloodline
wiped out for all time.

18:33.238 --> 18:36.158
And in that room full of betrayal,

18:36.992 --> 18:39.703
my own sister contradicts me.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.373
War is suicide.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.296
How many people are you willing
to sacrifice for your lie?

18:50.881 --> 18:54.092
Those who die will die gloriously…

18:55.469 --> 18:57.721
for Paya…

18:58.722 --> 19:02.726
for the new world
that will be built by our children.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.562
Who will also die
along with the rest of us

19:05.646 --> 19:08.398
when the Trivantians
burn Paya to the ground.

19:08.482 --> 19:11.026
You cannot believe
we can actually defeat them.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.821
What was I spared for if not for this?

19:16.031 --> 19:18.784
God put a sighted child in my belly,

19:18.867 --> 19:21.495
a child who'll be named for our father,

19:21.578 --> 19:27.376
in order to make this kingdom the vessel
through which sight returns to the world.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.585
It is my destiny.

19:28.669 --> 19:32.506
God help us.
You actually believe what you're saying.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.593
We will conquer Trivantes,

19:36.677 --> 19:38.637
absorb their armies

19:38.720 --> 19:42.766
and become the one true kingdom
on this land.

19:43.892 --> 19:44.893
Sibeth.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.774
Sibeth.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.404
There must be another way.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.161
You yourself stood by…

20:04.288 --> 20:09.459
when Tamacti Jun drew his blade,
with your blessing, to kill me.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.420
And God did not let it happen.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.339
You'd do well to remember that moment,
Sister.

20:14.423 --> 20:19.469
And remember as well that
it was I who saved you that day

20:19.553 --> 20:21.346
and not the other way around.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.645
Haniwa.

21:24.159 --> 21:27.663
If it was my bed, I wouldn't be able
to think of a reason to get out of it.

21:30.249 --> 21:31.667
Well, I'll show you one.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.387
Precious stones.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.186
This one's like a piece of the sky.

21:54.940 --> 21:55.941
What does that say?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.032
"Forever."

22:06.785 --> 22:08.036
That's beautiful.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.707
Except it wasn't.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.542
Beautiful?

22:14.877 --> 22:15.919
Forever.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.299
Well, maybe the feeling was.

22:40.736 --> 22:41.904
I'm sorry.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.573
No.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.200
No.

22:57.252 --> 23:01.089
The Payan queen has announced
that she is pregnant with a sighted child.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.218
Queen Kane also claims it was our army

23:04.301 --> 23:06.220
that attacked the capital city of Kanzua.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.305
So the queen lied to her people.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.517
Why then should we believe
that she is being any more truthful

23:11.600 --> 23:13.727
about this supposed sighted baby?

23:14.186 --> 23:15.646
How could she know such a thing?

23:15.729 --> 23:19.525
She could know, if the father was sighted.

23:19.608 --> 23:21.693
Let me stop you right there,
Commander General.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.904
Because I can already tell
where this is going.

23:23.987 --> 23:28.116
There have been multiple reports
of at least one sighted Payan man.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.244
You are speaking of Jerlamarel.

23:30.327 --> 23:33.288
Jerlamarel is not a man.
He is a myth and nothing more.

23:33.372 --> 23:35.791
We do not know that for sure.

23:35.874 --> 23:39.920
General Voss, our western border
is being attacked ceaselessly

23:40.003 --> 23:41.505
by the Ganites,

23:41.588 --> 23:44.258
and you would have us open up
another front to the east

23:44.341 --> 23:45.968
based on rumor and hearsay.

23:46.051 --> 23:48.470
Sight will return.

23:49.096 --> 23:51.139
And the first nation to harness its powers

23:51.223 --> 23:52.933
will be the nation
that dominates the world.

23:53.016 --> 23:56.436
Council has grown tired
of these theoretical arguments.

23:57.563 --> 24:01.191
Any nation that gives a foothold
in their society to the sighted

24:01.275 --> 24:03.652
is sowing the seeds
of their own destruction.

24:03.735 --> 24:07.489
And in the unlikely event
that any sighted people emerge,

24:07.573 --> 24:11.410
they will be executed
as threats to our republic.

24:11.493 --> 24:14.371
Other nations may not feel the same.

24:15.747 --> 24:18.166
We have not lost a war in 200 years.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.128
And there is no reason
to think we will begin now.

24:22.671 --> 24:27.384
Your fascination with sight
was interesting as a strategic exercise,

24:27.467 --> 24:29.761
but now it risks becoming a distraction.

24:29.845 --> 24:33.056
We must turn our attention to the west,

24:33.140 --> 24:36.602
where the Ganites are amassing
in greater and greater numbers.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.770
The People agree with the Military.

24:38.854 --> 24:40.397
The Bank agrees with the People.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.611
Council has ruled.

24:46.612 --> 24:49.323
Thank you for your service,
Commander General.

25:04.213 --> 25:05.214
Good morning.

25:07.549 --> 25:08.800
I fell asleep.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.306
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

25:16.016 --> 25:17.726
What are you thinking about?

25:22.439 --> 25:23.607
I'm wondering…

25:25.359 --> 25:27.611
what would happen if I let you go.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.120
You could come with me.

25:38.664 --> 25:44.211
I have a life here, a family, a career.

25:44.878 --> 25:48.715
Why would you stay someplace where you'd
be executed just for being who you are?

25:51.385 --> 25:54.555
You say that as if being sighted
is the only thing that I am.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.725
I'm a soldier of Trivantes.

26:00.435 --> 26:03.438
I'm the daughter and granddaughter
and great-granddaughter

26:03.522 --> 26:06.191
of people who built Trivantes,

26:06.275 --> 26:08.193
who fought and died for it.

26:08.861 --> 26:11.405
None of that would save you
if your secret got out.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.950
We could travel east.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.411
You could meet my brother.

26:19.705 --> 26:22.666
Maybe we could find other people like us.

26:23.542 --> 26:25.085
We could help change the world.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.550
You think we're special.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.011
But we're not.

26:35.888 --> 26:39.266
We're just… different.

26:40.976 --> 26:43.437
I think we're special
because we're different.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.359
If sight's meant to come back,
it'll come back.

26:51.904 --> 26:54.281
It's not our job to change the world.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.910
It's our job to…

26:59.620 --> 27:03.457
use our sight to make things better
right where we are.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.212
And how do we do that?

27:12.090 --> 27:13.133
Well…

27:16.220 --> 27:18.138
you could start by reading to me.

27:25.479 --> 27:26.897
I would love to.

27:36.198 --> 27:38.659
"'I could tell you my adventures

27:38.742 --> 27:42.412
beginning from this morning,'
said Alice, a little timidly.

27:43.247 --> 27:46.750
'But it's no use going back to yesterday,

27:47.334 --> 27:49.169
because I was a different person then.'"

28:05.352 --> 28:08.814
So this is the great warrior… Baba Voss.

28:12.943 --> 28:14.903
You're no fucking warrior now, are you?

28:22.077 --> 28:23.161
Get back!

28:25.706 --> 28:26.707
Get down!

28:27.332 --> 28:29.835
-Stay down!
-You broke my fucking nose!

28:32.754 --> 28:33.881
Sir.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.142
Baba Voss.

28:46.602 --> 28:48.645
Four days on the rack.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.274
I should thank you.

29:00.699 --> 29:04.203
Sorry. I can't offer you
anything stronger than water.

29:06.622 --> 29:09.750
But… here.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.183
I know your voice, Witchfinder.

29:28.602 --> 29:30.062
I hear it in my nightmares.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.150
Tamacti Jun.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.445
You killed my wife.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.908
I don't blame you for wanting me dead.

29:42.991 --> 29:45.786
I've committed many offenses
to you and your people,

29:45.869 --> 29:47.746
but killing your wife is not one of them.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.582
I'm gonna make it through these bars
at some point.

29:50.666 --> 29:53.252
And when I do, I'm gonna hurt you.

29:53.335 --> 29:56.839
Listen to me.
I was the one left for dead, not Maghra.

29:56.922 --> 29:59.591
Don't you say her name!
Don't you say her name.

29:59.675 --> 30:02.678
I could never harm her.
She is my princess.

30:02.761 --> 30:04.596
Princess? What are you talking about?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.139
You make no sense, Witchfinder.

30:06.223 --> 30:09.685
Your wife was born to His Highness,
the king Wolf Kane.

30:09.768 --> 30:13.480
And I was sworn to protect her
as the rightful heir of the Payan throne.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.691
You lie. You're a liar.

30:15.774 --> 30:21.780
Ask yourself what reason might I have
to lie to you at this point.

30:21.864 --> 30:26.869
So, my wife, whose children you hunted
since the day they were born,

30:28.161 --> 30:29.830
you're saying she's a princess?

30:29.913 --> 30:31.999
That's what I'm saying.

30:32.374 --> 30:35.335
And I'm also telling you

30:35.419 --> 30:40.507
that when she and the queen left me,
she was very much alive.

30:53.979 --> 30:55.397
-Come on.
-Side to side, Father.

30:56.148 --> 30:58.233
With a tap at the end of each swing.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.320
Constant contact, if you can.

31:04.198 --> 31:05.699
Hold the stick out farther.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.827
You're doing well. Good.
It'll get easier, Father.

31:08.911 --> 31:10.370
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

31:15.334 --> 31:17.503
Let go!

31:17.586 --> 31:21.048
I will find my way without any help
from anybody! Do you understand?

31:33.101 --> 31:34.394
What are we gonna do?

31:34.478 --> 31:36.563
He'll get used to it.
Just give him some time.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.315
God Flame.

31:39.900 --> 31:44.154
You have shielded me
from enemies known and unknown.

31:46.532 --> 31:52.246
Counsel your loyal servant. Strengthen
my resolve, that I will not be shaken.

31:55.874 --> 32:00.796
I will serve your will…
as you will preserve me at your pleasure.

32:00.879 --> 32:02.798
Your Majesty?

32:05.300 --> 32:06.301
Fuck.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.178
Apologies, my queen.

32:08.262 --> 32:10.848
Lord Harlan begs a moment of your time.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.808
Grant it to him, then leave.

32:12.891 --> 32:14.101
Yes, my queen.

32:20.649 --> 32:21.817
Oh, yeah.

32:22.818 --> 32:25.779
I love the smell of a lavender milk bath.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.991
Lord Harlan,

32:29.074 --> 32:31.702
you have a dangerous tendency
toward the informal.

32:31.785 --> 32:34.621
Some might mistake it for disrespect.

32:34.705 --> 32:35.956
On the contrary.

32:37.165 --> 32:40.127
I relish our history together,

32:40.210 --> 32:42.504
my childhood in your father's court.

32:44.298 --> 32:49.553
I think it binds us with a loyalty far
deeper than simply queen and subject.

32:50.179 --> 32:51.305
Don't you think?

32:52.848 --> 32:54.933
Which brings me
to the purpose of my visit.

32:59.062 --> 33:01.773
I am bursting with anticipation.

33:03.400 --> 33:08.864
Bold move, launching a war so soon
after consecrating a new capital.

33:11.408 --> 33:14.870
-If you don't have the stomach for it--
-I don't have the stomach for losing.

33:14.953 --> 33:18.665
Well, fortunately for you,
you're on the winning side.

33:21.210 --> 33:22.211
Marry me.

33:27.049 --> 33:31.261
Uh-huh.
Not exactly the response I hoped for.

33:31.345 --> 33:33.680
When your hubris surprises even me,

33:33.764 --> 33:36.350
it might be time
to rethink your worldview.

33:36.433 --> 33:40.771
You need me. My army, my people.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.648
You mean my army and my people.

33:44.441 --> 33:48.070
You're declaring war on
the greatest military force in the world.

33:48.153 --> 33:50.030
To even hope to succeed,

33:50.113 --> 33:53.200
you need the undying fealty
of every man and woman here.

33:53.909 --> 33:57.538
You have Pennsa,
and you will have all of Paya.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.916
And here I thought I already did.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.211
Yeah.

34:05.295 --> 34:09.466
Your subjects might die to protect
their rightful sovereign, but…

34:10.759 --> 34:12.844
I'll bet they're a little less generous
with their skins

34:12.928 --> 34:15.639
when it comes to protecting
a child they think is a witch.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.812
And if I marry you?

34:23.313 --> 34:25.858
I've been the rule of law here
for a generation.

34:27.568 --> 34:32.155
As stepfather to the sighted child,
I can change the minds that need changing.

34:34.241 --> 34:38.203
I can't think of a better way
to solidify your position.

34:40.998 --> 34:42.791
And yours.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.043
Of course, and mine.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.047
Why else would I do it?

34:55.137 --> 34:56.429
You can have my sister.

34:57.639 --> 35:00.434
Be stepfather
to her sighted royal children.

35:00.517 --> 35:01.935
She's got two of 'em.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.278
Isn't Maghra married already?

35:13.655 --> 35:15.240
Baba Voss is dead.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.492
And in any case,
Alkenny rutting in their tents

35:17.576 --> 35:19.828
doesn't qualify as marriage
under Payan law.

35:23.373 --> 35:26.210
I don't think Maghra would feel the same.

35:28.212 --> 35:32.508
Lord Harlan,
are you underestimating your own charm?

35:38.263 --> 35:39.640
You'll talk to her?

35:41.308 --> 35:42.309
Yes.

35:44.603 --> 35:48.315
Now come here and kneel before your queen.

35:51.276 --> 35:52.402
Open the gate!

35:57.324 --> 35:58.867
Two quarters up!

36:01.912 --> 36:04.248
Right one.

36:07.251 --> 36:08.752
Come on. We can't stay here.

36:09.628 --> 36:11.171
Wait. Wait.

36:13.966 --> 36:15.175
Straight.

36:19.888 --> 36:21.473
Left, two step.

36:21.557 --> 36:22.891
That boy can see.

36:22.975 --> 36:24.560
I said, left!

36:24.643 --> 36:26.228
You said you were the only one.

36:26.311 --> 36:28.981
It's Edo's secret program.
The boy's a son of Jerlamarel's.

36:29.064 --> 36:31.066
He trained him as part
of an arrangement he has with the general.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.360
Jerlamarel?

36:33.443 --> 36:35.529
So, what, he just--

36:35.612 --> 36:37.573
just gave that boy away?

36:38.699 --> 36:40.492
Wren, he's a child!

36:47.875 --> 36:51.503
He gave me away too. Do you understand?

36:52.171 --> 36:53.463
He sent me to die.

36:54.089 --> 36:57.342
-You're not going to die.
-We both know Edo will never let me go.

37:00.596 --> 37:01.722
Haniwa.

37:03.390 --> 37:04.725
Haniwa.

37:04.808 --> 37:09.146
I will do everything I can
to keep you safe. I promise.

37:09.855 --> 37:11.356
I need you to trust me.

37:23.368 --> 37:24.369
I do.

37:33.921 --> 37:34.922
Go.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.012
General, sir.

37:42.095 --> 37:46.058
Lieutenant. Get the prisoner
and bring her down to the street.

37:46.683 --> 37:48.143
Why? What's happening?

37:50.646 --> 37:53.649
Bring the girl downstairs. Now.

38:39.653 --> 38:40.988
Papa?

38:42.072 --> 38:43.407
Papa!

38:46.952 --> 38:49.371
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

38:49.454 --> 38:53.542
I wanted to give you the opportunity to
hear your daughter's cries one last time…

38:54.877 --> 38:57.379
before I sent her off
to be useful to the republic.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.719
People of Trivantes,

39:04.636 --> 39:07.848
I give you the great coward, Baba Voss.

39:07.931 --> 39:09.516
Murderer!

39:10.809 --> 39:16.148
Twenty-five winters have passed
since he murdered Teo Voss,

39:17.024 --> 39:18.066
my father,

39:18.817 --> 39:20.110
and fled the city.

39:20.944 --> 39:26.033
But Trivantian justice
never forgets and never relents,

39:26.116 --> 39:28.410
not in a thousand winters.

39:29.536 --> 39:31.330
On with him!

39:31.413 --> 39:32.497
Once around the city.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.000
No, no, no. Papa.

39:35.083 --> 39:39.838
-No! No, no, no.
-Murderer!

39:42.508 --> 39:43.550
Coward!

39:45.886 --> 39:49.848
-Haniwa!
-No! No, no, no.

39:49.932 --> 39:52.809
No, please. No, please. Please.

39:55.646 --> 39:58.273
General, why not leave her with me
a while longer?

39:58.690 --> 40:00.484
She's a valuable source of intelligence.

40:00.567 --> 40:04.279
No. I've imposed upon you enough, Wren.

40:04.363 --> 40:09.368
Besides, she has something greater
to offer than intelligence.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.913
Take the prisoner to my house. Now.

40:12.996 --> 40:13.997
Sir!

40:14.081 --> 40:15.082
Take her!

40:17.334 --> 40:19.878
Move! Come on. Now!

40:19.962 --> 40:21.046
Please...

40:26.844 --> 40:29.638
Her Highness, Queen Kane.

40:30.681 --> 40:34.268
Her Majesty, Princess Maghra.

40:39.022 --> 40:42.818
A walk among the people?
This doesn't feel like you.

40:43.610 --> 40:46.905
The citizens of Pennsa have experienced
too much distance from the crown.

40:46.989 --> 40:50.450
We must do what we can
to capture hearts and minds.

40:51.243 --> 40:54.413
So that's what we're doing.
We're capturing hearts and minds.

40:54.496 --> 40:58.542
Yes. But if you wanted to be truly useful,

40:59.168 --> 41:02.588
there are larger,
more strategic moves to be made.

41:02.671 --> 41:05.841
-Strategic moves?
-I told Harlan you would marry him.

41:06.508 --> 41:07.509
What?

41:09.428 --> 41:11.763
-What? You're kidding.
-I'm not.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.473
Her Highness, Queen Kane...

41:13.557 --> 41:15.559
Well, then
you're more insane than I thought.

41:15.642 --> 41:18.645
You're overreacting.
It's a business arrangement.

41:18.729 --> 41:20.230
You know what this is?

41:24.151 --> 41:25.986
Some kind of poorly formed God bone.

41:26.069 --> 41:30.157
This is a marriage cuff,
made for me by my husband, Baba Voss.

41:30.866 --> 41:33.202
Alkenny unions
aren't recognized by Payan law.

41:33.285 --> 41:37.998
So you won't be betraying Baba Voss,
if he's even alive.

41:39.666 --> 41:41.919
You coldhearted bitch.

41:43.212 --> 41:44.796
You can call me what you want,

41:46.048 --> 41:50.427
but I promised I would make Paya
safe for your children, and I did.

41:51.136 --> 41:55.224
But I think you fail to realize
just how close to the edge we are.

41:56.016 --> 41:58.352
Harlan's clearly suspicious about Kanzua.

41:58.852 --> 42:02.147
We've taken his city from him.
If we don't make it worth his while,

42:02.231 --> 42:04.775
we'll find ourselves
on the wrong end of an uprising.

42:06.068 --> 42:11.823
Like you said, we need Harlan
and the army he controls,

42:11.907 --> 42:12.908
until we don't.

42:12.991 --> 42:15.202
-Then you marry him.
-And make him king?

42:18.455 --> 42:20.415
We'll discuss this again
once you've calmed down.

42:20.499 --> 42:21.500
No, we won't.

42:21.583 --> 42:25.045
Heretic! The queen is a heretic.

42:25.671 --> 42:29.049
Witch lover! It's an abomination.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.384
Burn the witch!

42:30.467 --> 42:34.179
Burn her! And her whole family!

42:34.263 --> 42:35.472
-Find them.
-Right away.

42:35.556 --> 42:38.559
-Burn the queen! Burn her!
-Burn her!

42:40.394 --> 42:41.395
Witch!

42:41.478 --> 42:44.523
Like I said, we are closer to the edge
than you realize.

42:44.606 --> 42:46.191
Burn her!

43:03.750 --> 43:04.751
No.

43:12.176 --> 43:13.427
Raising three.

43:13.510 --> 43:16.013
-You're bluffing.
-Ready to put down and find out?

43:46.585 --> 43:47.586
Baba Voss?

43:49.922 --> 43:50.923
Baba Voss?

43:53.175 --> 43:54.176
Who are you?

43:54.259 --> 43:56.303
Someone who will be killed
if I'm caught helping you.

43:56.386 --> 43:59.264
So, please, no more questions
until we're out of here.

43:59.348 --> 44:02.017
-Where are we going?
-I'm taking you to Haniwa.

44:03.435 --> 44:05.938
-You know where she is?
-Yes, but we have to hurry.

44:06.021 --> 44:09.066
I took care of the guards, but we have
to be gone before the next rotation.

44:09.149 --> 44:10.442
Baba Voss.

44:11.109 --> 44:13.654
If you're planning to fight your way out,
you could use all the hands you can get.

44:13.737 --> 44:15.113
I'm here only for you.

44:15.197 --> 44:17.491
You wanna get to Maghra, as do I.

44:17.574 --> 44:20.160
It's only a matter of time
until her sister turns on her,

44:20.244 --> 44:21.578
if she hasn't already.

44:21.662 --> 44:23.497
You expect me to trust you, Witchfinder?

44:23.580 --> 44:26.041
I know how the queen thinks.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.544
You wouldn't even begin
to know how to look for her.

44:28.627 --> 44:33.882
And even if you did, she'd be surrounded
by Witchfinders. My Witchfinders.

44:33.966 --> 44:35.843
I am not releasing Tamacti Jun.

44:37.928 --> 44:38.929
He comes.

44:40.138 --> 44:42.307
I'm already committing treason
by releasing you.

44:42.391 --> 44:45.310
I won't compound that
by freeing the Witchfinder general.

44:46.103 --> 44:47.855
They can only hang you once.

44:47.938 --> 44:49.690
We go now, or we die here.

44:52.442 --> 44:53.443
You go.

45:02.411 --> 45:03.745
This way.

45:12.671 --> 45:14.298
This changes nothing!

45:14.882 --> 45:17.384
The second you are not useful to me,

45:17.467 --> 45:20.220
I'm going to rip out your entrails
and feed them to you.

45:20.804 --> 45:22.097
As you should.

45:33.942 --> 45:35.611
Take the guards' weapons.

45:40.115 --> 45:43.410
You walk too fast.
Your staff barely touches the ground.

45:44.661 --> 45:46.663
You're sighted, aren't you?

45:46.747 --> 45:49.416
Believe it or not,
I used to be pretty good at hiding it.

45:53.712 --> 45:54.922
Let's go.

46:15.067 --> 46:16.068
Haniwa.

46:23.534 --> 46:27.579
Don't worry.
It's not going to be your uncle Edo.

46:34.503 --> 46:38.090
If you fight… it will just take longer.

46:58.026 --> 46:59.820
-Truss!
-Noss!

47:00.612 --> 47:01.989
Noss!

47:34.813 --> 47:38.066
Yes. Keep this for Haniwa.

47:38.150 --> 47:40.402
Edo will have her someplace upstairs.

47:40.485 --> 47:42.237
We will separate to find her.

47:42.863 --> 47:45.282
Tamacti will hold off anyone down here
that wishes to join us.

47:45.365 --> 47:47.242
You'll need more than one man for that.

47:47.326 --> 47:48.869
Not when it's that man.

47:49.453 --> 47:50.454
Stairs.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.043
Don't be scared.

47:58.086 --> 47:59.588
I could be gentle.

48:06.094 --> 48:09.640
No. No!

48:09.723 --> 48:10.766
No!

48:15.229 --> 48:19.900
[signaling] You continue straight.
I will check the far side and meet you.

49:29.386 --> 49:31.013
It's okay, it's okay.

49:34.349 --> 49:36.935
I'm so sorry.

49:42.566 --> 49:44.902
-I knew you would come.
-I'm so sorry.

49:50.741 --> 49:52.367
I'm not alone.

49:54.453 --> 49:58.248
Baba Voss told me to give you this.
Let's go.

50:24.274 --> 50:26.693
When you left,
I was still the smaller one,

50:26.777 --> 50:28.654
still the weaker one.

50:29.238 --> 50:32.491
And you'll find that's no longer the case.

50:48.507 --> 50:52.135
To be honest, I was hoping
you'd have a bit more fight in you.

51:25.752 --> 51:27.504
How fitting…

51:28.589 --> 51:31.633
that I would kill you
with our father's sword.

51:33.260 --> 51:36.805
Edo. I'm sorry.

51:39.224 --> 51:43.478
But please, let my death be the end of it.

51:45.731 --> 51:49.735
Let Haniwa leave this place. Please.

51:58.118 --> 52:00.871
Know this before you die, Brother.

52:03.957 --> 52:09.588
Haniwa will spend the rest of her life
in my dungeons,

52:11.340 --> 52:12.966
a broodmare…

52:14.259 --> 52:19.097
mothering sighted children for my army

52:19.181 --> 52:23.143
until her womb is no longer able.

52:25.062 --> 52:28.148
And when she can produce no more…

52:30.526 --> 52:32.611
I will slit her throat

52:33.237 --> 52:36.990
and toss her body into the same manure pit

52:37.616 --> 52:41.537
into which I will throw yours.

52:41.620 --> 52:42.621
Leave him.

52:45.874 --> 52:46.875
Leave him!

52:55.843 --> 52:57.427
-Haniwa.
-Papa.

52:59.596 --> 53:00.973
Are you okay?

53:06.478 --> 53:07.604
We have to go. Come.

53:07.688 --> 53:08.981
Take me to him.

53:21.076 --> 53:24.705
If you ever come near my children again,

53:25.831 --> 53:29.543
I will burn this entire fucking city
to the ground…

53:30.502 --> 53:32.754
and leave you alive just long enough

53:32.838 --> 53:36.592
so you can smell your flesh melting
off of your face.

53:38.760 --> 53:39.970
There he is.

53:40.679 --> 53:43.348
There's the Baba Voss I know!

53:46.226 --> 53:47.227
We have to go.

54:13.462 --> 54:15.005
Tamacti Jun.

54:15.088 --> 54:16.590
Haniwa! No, no, no.

54:17.841 --> 54:20.969
Haniwa. No. He fights with us.

54:21.678 --> 54:23.013
He killed Mom.

54:24.348 --> 54:27.476
Listen to me. Your mother is not dead.

54:28.268 --> 54:29.895
What?

54:29.978 --> 54:31.230
What are you talking about?

54:31.313 --> 54:32.773
I'll explain later.

54:32.856 --> 54:34.650
Listen, right now we need to go.

54:35.317 --> 54:36.568
Is she safe?

54:37.152 --> 54:39.863
We don't know.
That's why we need to trust him.

54:42.950 --> 54:49.581
Haniwa, please. See me. We have to go.

54:49.665 --> 54:50.958
Please.

54:53.210 --> 54:55.087
Left. To the eastern gate.

55:42.384 --> 55:43.385
Come with us.

55:43.468 --> 55:44.678
I can't.

55:44.761 --> 55:46.305
Please.

55:53.729 --> 55:54.771
Forever.

55:57.232 --> 55:58.442
Haniwa!

55:58.525 --> 55:59.526
Go.

56:16.793 --> 56:17.961
Haniwa.

56:33.435 --> 56:34.436
Cora!

56:39.066 --> 56:40.108
Cora?

56:46.156 --> 56:48.033
She said I lost the baby.

56:49.826 --> 56:52.204
He was in the blood on my sheets.

56:53.539 --> 56:54.623
You killed her.

56:59.336 --> 57:00.796
She said,

57:00.879 --> 57:06.134
"Sometimes what forms cannot
grow to completion. It's too weak."

57:07.386 --> 57:08.470
Queen.

57:23.610 --> 57:25.153
What did you put in me?

57:26.405 --> 57:28.407
I did what you asked.

57:30.117 --> 57:33.912
I did not ask for this.

57:36.290 --> 57:37.875
You didn't have to kill her.

57:37.958 --> 57:40.169
Of course I did.

57:41.712 --> 57:43.213
No one can know.

57:44.882 --> 57:47.676
I announced my child, a sighted child.

57:48.760 --> 57:50.554
They'll think me mad.

57:52.347 --> 57:55.142
I will lie with you again.

57:55.225 --> 57:58.478
I will make you a stronger baby.

58:22.920 --> 58:25.881
You poor boy.

58:31.428 --> 58:37.059
You poor, stupid boy.
