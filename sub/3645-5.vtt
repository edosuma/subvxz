You're at the pinnacle, Sam,

00:08.976 --> 00:11.510
A pinnacle means
there's only one way to go,
and that's down.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.014
I thought getting a medal
was gonna be a lot more fun.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.215
Oh, my goodness. Sam?

00:16.217 --> 00:17.282
-Lillian?
-This is crazy.

00:17.284 --> 00:20.252
We were just talking
about him.
Weren't we, honey?

00:31.098 --> 00:34.900
Good. I can't stand to look
at your face,

00:34.902 --> 00:36.135
Go on. Get out.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.805
If you're gonna
sell my product,
better sample it first.

-Yeah.

Nice to meet you, Mrs. Karn.
I'm Dennis Wilson.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.115
Are you okay?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.818
I'm fine, Mom.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.620
It was your birthday.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.854
Last month.

10:22.856 --> 10:28.693
I remember turning 17,
feeling so grown up.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.329
That was a long time ago.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.733
Seventeen is older
than it used to be, I guess.

10:37.337 --> 10:37.636
I...

10:37.638 --> 10:43.341
I didn't know how to contact
you. We sold the house.

10:43.343 --> 10:47.278
It was too big.
We weren't using half of it.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.484
Here's the new address,
if you ever...

10:55.989 --> 10:57.255
Okay.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.225
There's a bedroom for you.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.432
Happy birthday.

11:12.406 --> 11:17.375
My play was closing.
There was a party afterwards.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.180
Um...

11:22.182 --> 11:24.182
Your husband didn't go with?

11:24.184 --> 11:28.386
He said he had some
reading to do. He's...

11:29.222 --> 11:32.590
He was running for
state senate.

11:32.592 --> 11:35.326

11:35.328 --> 11:38.196

11:38.198 --> 11:40.899
-Was the gun his?
-I don't know.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.568
I've never seen it before,
but it might have been.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.839
I saw boxes in the guest room.
Maybe some of your clothes?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.307
You moving?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.542

11:50.544 --> 11:55.246
I was in rehearsals
for this play. I didn't have
time to finish unpacking.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.883
-Hodiak, radio call for you.
-I'll just be a minute.

11:58.885 --> 12:03.121
Moving in?
How long were you married?

12:03.423 --> 12:03.855
Three months.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.991
The commissioner wants
to see you at the station.

12:11.498 --> 12:15.433
I'll be as fast as I can.
What are you gonna do next?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.001
Canvass the neighbors.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.436
Do you have any idea
what this is about?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.605
They probably want to give me
another medal.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.907
Give her a tissue. All right?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.976
I don't have a tissue.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.281
Ma'am.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.065
-Charmain Tully?
-Yes, sir.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.566
Who taught you to shoot?

12:48.568 --> 12:52.403
My father. He used to take
me hunting. Pheasants.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.106
-I'm Captain Perry with the...
-The Red Squad.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.209
The Criminal Conspiracy
Section, officially.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.545
Not just Reds we're hunting
these days.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.681
Negro agitators, student
radicals, you name it.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.917
I got a call from
Lieutenant Cutler.

13:05.919 --> 13:10.121
He explained how instrumental
you were in closing
the Welles case.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.559
And frankly, honey,
I wanted to see what
the fuss was about.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.632
Are you trained for
undercover work?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.967
Not officially,
but I have experience.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.204
Do you have a husband? Kids?

13:26.206 --> 13:26.671
No, sir.

13:26.673 --> 13:30.275
The kinds of things you
have to do undercover
are the kinds of things

13:30.277 --> 13:32.377
your future husband
won't approve of.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.913
Well, I'm not sure
I have a husband in my future.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.316
Most men, they don't like
that I'm a police officer,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.751
which is why they won't
suspect that I am one.

13:39.753 --> 13:43.154
This isn't playing dress-up.
It's a dangerous assignment.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.523
We've been trying
to infiltrate the SDS,

13:45.525 --> 13:47.792
Students for
a Democratic Society.

13:47.794 --> 13:52.363
One of those anti-war,
anti-everything
protest groups.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.133
They're paranoid.
Don't trust outsiders.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.770
My bosses think a female
might have a better chance,

13:58.772 --> 14:01.773
and you're the best
female cop we got.

14:01.775 --> 14:05.743
-What do you think?
-I think...

14:05.745 --> 14:12.083
I don't want to be
a female cop.
I just want to be a cop, sir.

14:15.488 --> 14:19.591
The commissioner's in my
office with Kellaher from IA.

14:19.593 --> 14:20.291
They tell you what it's about?

14:20.293 --> 14:25.129
Good news from the IA comes
in the form of total silence,
so it ain't that.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.365
Hey, it's Shafe's first day.
You think maybe...

14:27.367 --> 14:28.867
Yeah, no, I'll send someone
to hold his hand.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.670
-Thank you.
-Hey, look,
you want me in there?

14:32.672 --> 14:36.307
If I get in trouble,
I'll send up a flare.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.345
Besides, most of the bad stuff
I did with you.

14:46.853 --> 14:47.719
-Sir.
-Sam.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.922
No offense, sir,
but I'm in the middle
of a murder investigation,

14:50.924 --> 14:53.124
and the first few hours
are the most critical, so...

14:53.126 --> 14:54.926
I'm not here to
waste your time, Detective.

14:54.928 --> 14:59.197
After reviewing your
case history, a number of
questions have been raised...

14:59.199 --> 15:00.398
-No.
-Excuse me?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.334
I don't know what he's dug up,
sir, but I know why
he's digging.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.704
I'm embarrassed to say that
this is a personal matter
between myself

15:06.706 --> 15:11.676
and Mr. Kellaher and a young
woman named Lillian Bariano,

15:11.678 --> 15:12.477
who, when I dated her,

15:12.479 --> 15:16.781
was a few months
shy of becoming
Mrs. Lillian Kellaher.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.991
I won't be party to this
game-playing and backstabbing,

15:27.360 --> 15:31.562
but his accusations
are serious,
and they're gonna be heard.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.831
Ask your questions.

15:33.833 --> 15:37.969
I'll be back for your
impartial conclusions.

15:43.877 --> 15:47.111
Let's start with
your time cards.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.346
(SIGHS)

15:51.318 --> 15:55.687
-So it was just the one shot?
-Yeah, just the one shot.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.356
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.860
Choir boy's a good look
on you.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.095
What can I do
for you, Lieutenant?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.497
Hodiak said you need
a babysitter.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.533
Only one I could spare was me.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.535
Pay very close attention.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.004
You're gonna learn
a lot today.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.272
He shot himself. Done.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.808
-Let's get lunch.
-And there's no note.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.243
And who kills himself in
a hallway?

16:19.245 --> 16:23.014
-Oh, what, you think somebody
staged it?
-Maybe.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.215
Good, so run for prints
on the gun.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.884
I bet you a beer his
thumbprint's on the trigger.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.953
-Why his thumb?
-Look.

16:31.358 --> 16:36.561
This? It's hard to pull
the trigger, especially for
an inexperienced shooter.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.229
This, it's easy-peasy.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.699
The prints will take a bit,
but I'll collect on
that beer now.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.068
ME says time of death
was around 11:45.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.304
One neighbor heard a gunshot
around that same time.

16:46.306 --> 16:52.010
Another neighbor saw a woman,
an agitated woman,
who was not the wife,

16:52.012 --> 16:53.277
leaving around midnight.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.612
My guess? He was stepping out.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.714
Is that your guess, Detective?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.217
Well, it seems that maybe
we should figure out,

16:59.219 --> 17:01.652
you know,
who that other woman was.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.289
You know, right?
What do I know?
It's my first day.

17:05.291 --> 17:09.494
Friedrich Huber.
Shot in his car while idling
at a red light.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.463
That was your first case as
a homicide detective, correct?

17:12.465 --> 17:15.600
Closed the case.
Got the conviction.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.536
Anything else stand out to you
about that case?

17:21.307 --> 17:24.542
It was, what, 10,
12 years ago? I don't have
a photographic memory.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.978
And yet a third of the time,
you fail to turn
your notebooks

17:26.980 --> 17:29.047
over to the DA
during discovery,

17:29.049 --> 17:31.182
so you have a poor memory
but you don't take notes?

17:31.184 --> 17:34.218
I didn't say I had
a poor memory.
I said it was 12 years ago.

17:34.220 --> 17:39.223
It's like thirteen, actually.
It was a big story. Got press.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.291
You're not mentioned.

17:40.293 --> 17:44.996
On the night of
Friedrich Huber's murder,
did you assault your partner?

17:44.998 --> 17:46.330
-A Detective...
-Ed Cutler.

17:46.332 --> 17:50.401
-We're in his office
right now.
-Ed Cutler, see, I knew...

17:50.403 --> 17:51.235
I knew I recognized that name

17:51.237 --> 17:54.872
'cause his name
is in the paper taking
credit for your work.

17:54.874 --> 18:01.179
We had a dispute, as men.
We settled it like men.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.715
You don't think a man that
can't control his temper,

18:04.717 --> 18:06.651
who beats his own partner
to a pulp,

18:06.653 --> 18:10.154
reflects poorly
on this department, Detective?

18:10.156 --> 18:14.525
The other night, Lillian said
you guys had been
talking about me.

18:14.627 --> 18:19.030
Or was she just waxing about
younger, happier days?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.766
Don't you want your wife
to be happy?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.936
You are gonna be
a pleasure to fire.

18:25.171 --> 18:25.703
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

18:25.705 --> 18:28.739
Hodiak, your wife's
on the line for you.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.176
Ladies.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.514
She's on line two.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.448
All right,
here's what I want you to do.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.518
Go back to your desk,
pick up line two,
and tell her I'm not here.

18:40.520 --> 18:40.818
What?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.553
-I don't want to talk to her.
-She says it's important.

18:42.555 --> 18:47.091
Isn't it always?
Just tell her I'm in court,
testifying all day.

18:47.093 --> 18:47.658
What are you gonna do?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.261
I'm gonna stand here like a
moron with the phone to my ear

18:50.263 --> 18:52.130
and read the sports section.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.133
Wait, get me
the sports section, too.

19:01.407 --> 19:05.877
Join us for peace.
Action against the draft.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.746
-Peace on earth!
-Hey, beautiful.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.817
Is something wrong?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.987
No, I...

19:17.190 --> 19:19.790
My brother, he was in Vietnam.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.027
-What was his name?
-Nicholas.

19:24.130 --> 19:29.033
We're trying to make sure
no one else loses a brother
to an unjust war.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.369
Good luck.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.304
We could use your help.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.239
Hand out flyers.
Hold up a sign.

19:35.241 --> 19:38.809
Pretty girl like you,
people would want to stop.

19:40.747 --> 19:46.350
Doesn't it just seem like,
I don't know,
waving signs and protesting,

19:46.352 --> 19:49.053
it doesn't really do much
if nobody's listening?

19:49.055 --> 19:52.390
There are other ways
of making people hear you.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.625
Do you know what Boeing is?

19:54.627 --> 19:55.193
The airplane company?

19:55.195 --> 19:59.764
They also make weapons,
fighter jets,
and missiles, and bombs.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.799
Companies like that,
they make money off this war.

20:01.801 --> 20:07.271
They're having a convention
tonight at a hotel in
Beverly Hills and we're going.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.940
What are you gonna do?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.442
Come and see.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.157
Where you been, Cherry?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.827
Dennis took me shopping.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.130
Bought you this?

20:34.167 --> 20:36.334
Looks nice.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.005
Feels nice.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.443
I can't.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.945
Worried you'll tear
your pretty new frock?

20:47.947 --> 20:51.382
No, Dennis is taking me
to meet a friend of his.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.185
And why is he sharing
what ain't his to offer?

20:54.187 --> 20:56.520
It's not like that.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.889
Then what?

20:58.891 --> 21:02.393
You think he's bringing you
for conversation?

21:02.729 --> 21:03.961
Huh?

21:04.264 --> 21:05.630
(SHOUTING) Huh?

21:07.467 --> 21:09.233
Come here.

21:09.235 --> 21:16.540
Hey, everyone, everybody,
I want you to take a good look
at sweet Cherry pop,

21:17.076 --> 21:21.779
and this beautiful new dress
Dennis bought for us.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.681
It's real nice, Charlie.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.651
Dennis has given us so much,

21:26.653 --> 21:34.125
but Dennis is a means to
many ends, our family's ends.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.762
Not yours, Cherry pop.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.730
It's just a dress.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.600
Then take it off.

21:44.470 --> 21:50.241
Take it off,
and give it to the family.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.649
It's for everyone.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.889
Yeah, that's good.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.425
Everybody have a turn.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.860
Go on, take your share.

22:21.274 --> 22:25.910
He's taking me to
a record producer,
to listen to me sing.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.746
You can have the dress.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.191
I'm ready to go.

22:40.259 --> 22:41.892
Cool.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.801
Hey, you know what?

22:50.803 --> 22:53.504
You're gonna need somebody
to play backup for you,

22:53.506 --> 22:56.340
and guitar was never
really my thing.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.608
Charlie?

22:57.610 --> 22:59.543
What do you say, man?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.912
Emma would really owe you one.

23:02.081 --> 23:07.518
Well, I wouldn't want to leave
her hanging in the breeze.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.957
A friendly face couldn't hurt.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.393
All right.

23:20.900 --> 23:21.699
(SIGHS) The guy was a saint.

23:21.701 --> 23:26.137
No money problems,
no mistresses, didn't even
hit on his secretary.

23:26.139 --> 23:29.774
Sounds like a boring,
depressing life,
not much to live for.

23:29.776 --> 23:30.474
And he was such a nice guy

23:30.476 --> 23:34.445
that he was even paying
for his ex-girlfriend's
apartment in the Bronx,

23:34.447 --> 23:36.013
but guess who was
in LA visiting family?

23:36.015 --> 23:40.251
Stilted ex-lover gets revenge
on the man who
broke her heart?

23:40.253 --> 23:41.419
Women are crazy.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.188
I got a name and an address,
hotel on Wilshire.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.322
We can be there in 20 minutes.

23:45.324 --> 23:48.192
You send a uniform
to bring her in,
that way we get a long lunch.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.127
What is this, your first day?

23:59.338 --> 24:00.738
Chauvinist pig.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.907
-What?
-He's a chauvinist!

24:02.909 --> 24:07.411
To him, you're just an object
to be groped and ogled!

24:07.413 --> 24:08.712
Come on.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.753
The cheapest room
in the hotel kind of defeats
the purpose, doesn't it?

24:15.755 --> 24:20.157
If you want to pay cash
for the penthouse suite,
be my guest.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.438
This is perfect.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.915
-Terry?
-Dennis.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.185
-How's it going?
-Good to see you, man.

24:48.254 --> 24:52.423
-Hi, I'm Terry.
-I know who you are.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.225
Charlie Manson.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.927
And this is Emma.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.163
-Your house is beautiful.
-Thanks.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.832
I'm just renting. Please.

25:02.068 --> 25:05.069
Can I get you a drink?
Something else?

25:05.071 --> 25:07.638
-Yeah, whatever you have.
-Okay.

25:09.442 --> 25:13.177
This is for
the guest of honor.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.145
Thank you.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.214
How'd you two meet?

25:17.216 --> 25:19.750
We're actually staying
at Dennis' house.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.586
He is super generous...

25:57.557 --> 25:59.757
KELLAHER: <i> All right,</i>
<i> if you were in court,</i>
<i> where's your court slip?</i>

25:59.759 --> 26:03.827
You expect us to take
your word that you weren't
in some bar?

26:03.829 --> 26:04.662
I was testifying.

26:04.664 --> 26:08.399
It's kind of hard to steal
overtime when you're sitting
in front of the judge.

26:08.401 --> 26:09.900
Why don't you check
the reporter's logs?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.703
Okay, what do you know
about Dahlia Flores?

26:14.440 --> 26:15.639
She's an informant.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.942
She's given me
good information a few times.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.076
A few times?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.611
Seven homicides, same witness.

26:20.613 --> 26:25.015
Now that's an awfully lucky
person to be on so many
unrelated crime scenes,

26:25.017 --> 26:27.384
-wouldn't you say?
-Well, she's a dope addict.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.185
I'd call that pretty unlucky.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.920
You expect me, or anybody,
to believe that?

26:29.922 --> 26:33.457
-Seven juries did.
-You lied under oath,
repeatedly.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.527
Every single one of your cases
is now gonna have
to be reopened,

26:36.529 --> 26:41.632
and guilty people will walk
free because you were
too lazy to do your job.

26:41.634 --> 26:42.866
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-(DOOR OPENS)

26:42.868 --> 26:44.134
-Hodiak, there's a call...
-Not now.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.870
Sorry, but you need
to take this.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.809
Be my guest.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.683
Detective Hodiak.

26:59.685 --> 27:04.121
Yeah, no...
Well, we're estranged, yeah.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.376
All right.

27:39.692 --> 27:43.060
You know Hodiak's wife, Opal?

27:44.130 --> 27:47.064
Well, I see her around now
and then, why?

27:49.301 --> 27:51.135
She just killed herself.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.407
She what?

29:02.408 --> 29:03.907
Sam.

29:03.909 --> 29:07.945
I'm not taking my pants off,
so don't get too excited.

29:08.414 --> 29:12.116
Is it true about Opal?

29:12.718 --> 29:20.224
Her neighbor was returning
a casserole dish, found her.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.329
Some empty bottles of vodka.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.466
Empty bottle of diazepam.

29:29.702 --> 29:32.269
I had to ID the body.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.439
I'm sorry.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.175
-I can't imagine...
-Yeah, you can.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.179
And it's worse.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.883
-Cutler's...
-Yeah.

29:52.258 --> 29:55.793
So I think it's about time
we heard this voice.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.729
Go ahead, Emma.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.466
Showtime.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.637
You ready, Charlie?

30:07.273 --> 30:08.906
Always.

30:41.307 --> 30:45.175
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I can't do this.

30:45.778 --> 30:47.344
No, come back.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.683
Don't sweat it, fellas.

30:52.852 --> 30:56.320
We all get those butterflies
now and then.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.857
Hey, how about I hit you
with something real?

31:13.072 --> 31:16.406
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

31:20.212 --> 31:25.182
Hi, Viola.
I'm Detective Shafe.
This is Lieutenant Cutler.

31:25.184 --> 31:28.852
-We just have a few questions
for you.
-Okay.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.292
Were you at Edwin Kimball's
house last night?

31:39.632 --> 31:41.298
What time?

31:44.637 --> 31:48.605
I don't remember exactly. Why?

31:48.607 --> 31:50.407
Did you argue?

31:50.542 --> 31:53.410
I wouldn't call it arguing.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.445
We spoke.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.715
-About what?
-All kinds of things.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.752
Money and...

32:07.660 --> 32:09.493
That baby his?

32:09.495 --> 32:10.360
Of course it is.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.562
Yeah? Does his wife know?

32:12.564 --> 32:13.230
I am his wife.

32:13.232 --> 32:17.301
Not according to his other
wife, or, you know, the law.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.937
We were married, common law.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.838
California doesn't have
common law marriage.

32:21.840 --> 32:27.010
We lived in New York,
together, eight years.

32:27.012 --> 32:27.711
So you were blackmailing him.

32:27.713 --> 32:30.614
You show up knocked up
with his baby, asking for
money, is that how it is?

32:30.616 --> 32:36.687
I only asked him for what he
owed me, for what he wrote
me in the letters.

32:36.689 --> 32:38.922
-Yeah, did you kill him?
-What?

32:38.924 --> 32:39.790
Did you kill him?

32:39.792 --> 32:40.624
-Cutler.
-Yeah, he's dead.

32:40.626 --> 32:46.196
Shot to death in his house
within minutes of you being
there fighting about money.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.533
He's not dead.

32:50.769 --> 32:51.668
He is.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.637
He wrote me
a letter this morning,

32:53.639 --> 32:57.874
and he put it in my purse
while I was sleeping.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.144
He told me that you would ask
about this.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.914
This is all
a misunderstanding.

33:04.183 --> 33:04.948
(LAUGHS)

33:04.950 --> 33:09.019
He's gonna laugh
when I tell him. (LAUGHS)

33:21.433 --> 33:26.603
Detective, are you sure
you're okay to proceed?

33:27.206 --> 33:29.673
I'd like to get this
over with.

33:30.209 --> 33:34.378
Tampering with a witness,
manipulating evidence,
providing false testimony.

33:34.380 --> 33:38.281
I believe the detective's
actions warrant a hearing
before the board,

33:38.283 --> 33:42.886
and it is my recommendation
that he be removed
from the police force.

33:42.888 --> 33:45.288
Fire me now, or I'll resign.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.492
This is about putting
my picture in the newspaper
next to the words

33:48.494 --> 33:52.529
"crooked cop"
and it'll happen whether
I sit through it or not.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.502
No, no, this isn't right.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.238
The man's wife is...

34:02.508 --> 34:06.009
There's a conflict
of interest, right?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.445
I'm ending this.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.415
So take a few days, yeah?

34:11.417 --> 34:15.452
I want you off the streets
until you can function.

Well, I'll be seeing you.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.834
Give my love to Lillian.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.744
She's obviously
not right in the head.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.979
She was there at the time.
She has motive.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.714
All right, look, great job.
You proved me wrong, slick.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.084
She did it, all right?
Now, all you
gotta do is prove it in court,

34:47.086 --> 34:50.187
which, given the evidence,
should be impossible.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.157
Sam.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.393
Let's get a drink and talk...

34:56.728 --> 34:58.495
Or just drink.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.536
Thanks.

35:13.112 --> 35:17.414
You said your husband
sent you a letter.
Do you still have it?

35:17.749 --> 35:18.982
Mmm-hmm.

35:32.197 --> 35:34.064
I bet the news does a story.

35:34.066 --> 35:39.069
-"Protestors inconvenience
hotel maid."
-We did more than that.

35:39.071 --> 35:41.605
We sent a message.

35:42.708 --> 35:43.573
Did we?

35:43.575 --> 35:46.576
I mean, the hotel was hosting
the convention,

35:46.578 --> 35:47.811
but will they know we did it?

35:47.813 --> 35:52.349
And even if they do,
how will they know
why we did it?

35:53.285 --> 35:54.751
Honey.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.586
This is Charmain.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.755
She helped with
the action today.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.391
Charmain is right.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.394
We've got to start thinking
a lot bigger.

36:20.145 --> 36:27.317
Dodgers' opening day
on Wednesday, against
the Phillies. You going?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.653
Hmm?

36:29.922 --> 36:32.956
Yeah, with Jeannie.
I'm going, yeah.

36:32.958 --> 36:37.460
I mean, Osteen's not
getting any younger, right?

36:40.399 --> 36:43.333
Yeah, the old man
can still pitch.

36:44.002 --> 36:48.271
Sam, look,
do you think that...

36:48.440 --> 36:52.676
-Do you think that
what happened...
-Cut. Cut.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.579
It had nothing to do with you.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.583
It could have been
an accident. It could...

36:59.952 --> 37:01.585
Forty pills?

37:02.054 --> 37:04.287
That's not an accident.

37:09.094 --> 37:14.898
I spent a lot of years
trying to make Opal happy.

37:16.602 --> 37:21.204
Hard-fought battles,
blood was spilled.

37:22.474 --> 37:26.476
I am ashamed

37:26.478 --> 37:32.782
to say how long it took me
to realize I was the thing
making her unhappy.

37:35.988 --> 37:39.022
Maybe you gave up too soon.

37:55.007 --> 37:57.140
I got to go see Walt.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.417
-Lieutenant.
-I'm not on the clock.

38:07.419 --> 38:12.422
The letters that crazy
old bat Viola
said Kimball was sending her?

38:12.424 --> 38:13.923
Let me just read one to you.

38:13.925 --> 38:17.827
"My dearest, I know this
letter comes as quite a shock,

38:17.829 --> 38:22.732
"but death is the only way to
set right the wrongs
I have done you."

38:23.135 --> 38:25.268
-A suicide note.
-Yeah.

38:25.270 --> 38:25.835
How'd you know to look?

38:25.837 --> 38:29.572
The thumbprint was a match
on both the trigger
and the trigger guard.

38:29.574 --> 38:32.075
You were right from the start.

38:32.244 --> 38:33.476
(SCOFFS)

38:34.579 --> 38:38.515

Listen...

39:07.679 --> 39:10.480
Who did that to you?

39:15.754 --> 39:19.389
That's not from the protest,
is it?

39:20.959 --> 39:23.426
Did they do anything else
to you?

39:30.736 --> 39:37.607
I told them that I would say
anything, anything,
if they'd just let me go.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.344
I just want to go home.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.582
Where's Mom?

39:50.789 --> 39:53.123
I came here with some
bad news.

39:53.125 --> 39:56.393
-Walt...
-Time's up.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.329
What?

40:02.167 --> 40:02.732
What?

40:02.734 --> 40:06.469
I thought I had a way to get
you out, but I don't.

40:06.471 --> 40:13.243
I'm sorry. But I'm not
giving... I'm not giving up.

40:13.345 --> 40:14.577
Okay? I'm working.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.512
-Dad.
-Walt...

40:15.514 --> 40:17.414
Dad, no, just don't go.

-Goodbye, Walt.
-Don't go.

-Goodbye.
-Don't... Don't go, Dad.

Emma.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.484
You know how it is.
