WEBVTT

00:31.197 --> 00:34.075
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE
CONFISCATED MY BAG.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.411
THEY KNOW.
SOMEHOW THEY KNOW!

00:36.494 --> 00:39.622
IT'S JUST A CO-INCIDENCE.
YOU'VE BEEN UNLUCKY.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.458
{\an1}NO WAY IS THAT A
CO-INCIDENCE.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.419
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE
WHEN HE FINDS THAT FILE.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.713
{\an1}IF HE CONFRONTS ME
I'LL CONFRONT HIM BACK

00:46.796 --> 00:47.839
DON'T YOU WORRY!

00:47.922 --> 00:49.716
{\an1}WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH JOY?

00:49.799 --> 00:50.467
WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET?

00:50.550 --> 00:53.845
{\an1}WHY CAN'T I HAVE HER
HOME NUMBER?

00:53.928 --> 00:54.971
OR YOU COULD DENY IT?

00:55.054 --> 00:57.891
{\an1}NO MARA. THERE IS SOME SORT
OF CONSPIRACY GOING ON

00:57.974 --> 01:00.977
{\an1}AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.772
SO - HOW'S THINGS BETWEEN
YOU AND AMBER

01:03.855 --> 01:05.940
SINCE THIS WHOLE
KISSING INCIDENT?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.817
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AMBER, DUDE.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.235
ONLY ASKING.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.571
{\an5}BUT I DO HAVE MY EAR TO THE
GROUND IF YOU NEED ANY
INFORMATION.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.323
NO THANKS. I THINK I'VE GOT
IT COVERED.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.908
OF COURSE. YOU'RE MICK.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.159
YEP.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.828
AS IF YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND ALFIE.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.370
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.956
WHAT?!

01:22.040 --> 01:24.375
ALFIE AND AMBER, IN THE
LAUNDRY ROOM LAST NIGHT.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.835
THE LAUNDRY ROOM?!

01:25.919 --> 01:29.088
OHH YOU DIDN'T KNOW!

01:29.172 --> 01:31.633
SORRY MATE, I HATE TO BE THE
BEARER OF BAD NEWS, BUT...

01:31.716 --> 01:34.302
{\an5}IT DOES LOOK LIKE ALFIE'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A
ROMEO THAN WE THOUGHT.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.179
RIGHT!

01:36.262 --> 01:37.806
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO GET ALFIE.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.224
{\an3}NO! NO! NO!

01:39.307 --> 01:39.933
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.893
I DO. I REALLY REALLY DO.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.438
{\an3}NO YOU DON'T MICK.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.817
{\an1}ALFIE'S A JOKE. HE'S NOT
WORTH THE EFFORT.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.734
YEAH.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.695
{\an1}AND AMBER, SHE'S JUST A
TWO-TIMING FLIRT.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.531
{\an1}YOU'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HER.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.782
{\an3}AMBER IS GONE.
HISTORY.

01:55.865 --> 01:56.533
I DON'T NEED THAT.

01:56.616 --> 02:00.578
THAT'S MY MAN.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.038
I'M WAITING FOR
AN APOLOGY MICK.

02:02.121 --> 02:05.124
YOU'LL BE WAITING
A LONG TIME THEN.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.506
WAIT A MINUTE!
I'M THE MAD ONE!

02:11.589 --> 02:14.300
HE'S THE ONE
WHO STOOD ME UP!

02:18.179 --> 02:19.889
WHAT ARE YOU GRINNING AT?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.057
JUST HAPPY TO BE ALIVE.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.393
{\an3}ANY SIGN OF VICTOR
WITH OUR BAGS?

02:23.476 --> 02:24.352
<i>NO. ITíS GREAT ISN'T IT?</i>

02:24.435 --> 02:28.898
{\an1}THE PERFECT EXCUSE NOT TO DO
FRENCH HOMEWORK.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.400
<i>AH. SPOKE TOO SOON.</i>

02:30.483 --> 02:32.819
HERE WE ARE. ALL CHECKED.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.571
FIND ANYTHING?

02:34.654 --> 02:37.574
NOTHING THAT SHOULDN'T
BE THERE, NO.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.075
{\an3}WEIRD HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.369
MAYBE HE DIDN'T FIND IT.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.412
IS IT THERE?
HAVE YOU GOT IT?

02:42.495 --> 02:44.789
NO!

02:44.873 --> 02:46.082
SO HE DID FIND IT THEN.

02:46.165 --> 02:47.584
OBVIOUSLY.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.335
BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.545
THINK ABOUT IT.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.964
{\an3}THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
ANY KIND OF DISCUSSION,

02:53.047 --> 02:54.007
{\an3}SO IT'S EASIER TO JUST
STEAL THE FILE BACK

02:54.090 --> 02:56.384
AND PRETEND IT
NEVER HAPPENED.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.343
I SUPPOSE.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.262
{\an3}NOW DO YOU BELIEVE
THERE'S A CONSPIRACY?

02:59.345 --> 03:00.930
DO YOU THINK MICK'S
PLAYING HARD TO GET?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.099
IF HE IS, I THINK THATíS
SOOOOO CHILDISH.

03:03.182 --> 03:07.770
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK
YOURSELF WWVBD?

03:07.854 --> 03:11.357
WHAT WOULD
VICTORIA BECKHAM DO?

03:14.152 --> 03:17.113
{\an5}<i>(spooky music)</i>

03:14.152 --> 03:17.113
CRISIS AVERTED
FOR NOW.....

03:27.707 --> 03:31.753
<i>(sound of crow)</i>

03:33.212 --> 03:34.964
{\an4}<i>(whispers)</i>
SO WE'RE STILL SNEAKING OUT
THIS LUNCHTIME YEAH?

03:35.048 --> 03:37.884
{\an3}YOU'RE GETTING REALLY GOOD AT
THIS SNEAKING AROUND STUFF.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.052
LEARNING FROM THE BEST

03:39.135 --> 03:41.679
WHISPER, WHISPER WHISPER.
VERY COSY.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.973
{\an1}LET'S GO.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.517
{\an5}WHEN DID YOU BECOME HER
FRIEND INSTEAD OF MINE
FABIAN?

03:46.601 --> 03:49.771
SINCE YOU BECAME SUCH A
WITCH PATRICIA.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.648
HE CAN BE BOTH OF OUR
FRIENDS?

03:51.731 --> 03:55.944
NOT LIKELY.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.487
HEY TRUDY!

03:57.570 --> 04:00.490
BEFORE YOU ASK, ALFIE'S HAD
THE LAST OF THE HASH BROWNS.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.159
{\an4}I COULD MAKE YOU A TRUDY
PANCAKE SURPRISE
IF YOU LIKE?

04:03.242 --> 04:04.577
{\an3}NO....
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK.

04:04.661 --> 04:09.415
{\an6}WAS IT JOY'S PARENTS WHO
CAME AND CLEARED HER ROOM
OUT LAST WEEK?

04:09.499 --> 04:12.961
ERM...IT WAS A MAN. I'M NOT
SURE IF IT WAS HER FATHER.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.587
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER PARENTS.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.005
{\an3}AND WHEN WERE YOU TOLD
SHE WAS LEAVING?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.675
THE SAME MORNING SHE LEFT.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.176
DIDN'T YOU THINK
THAT WAS WEIRD?

04:20.259 --> 04:24.472
WELL, JOY ALWAYS WAS
A WALKING SOAP OPERA

04:24.555 --> 04:26.015
{\an1}I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BIT SUDDEN;

04:26.099 --> 04:27.183
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT WEIRD.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.019
{\an3}AND WHAT ABOUT NINA COMING
TO REPLACE HER THE SAME DAY?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.479
NOW THAT WAS WEIRD RIGHT?

04:31.562 --> 04:33.022
NOT REALLY,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.358
{\an4}NINA WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO
START AT THE BEGINNING OF
TERM,

04:35.441 --> 04:38.027
{\an1}BUT SHE'S ON A SCHOLARSHIP
AND THERE WAS A ....

04:38.111 --> 04:42.615
A BUREAUCRATIC MIX-UP WHICH
MEANT HER MONEY WAS DELAYED,

04:42.991 --> 04:47.704
{\an5}SO HAVE YOU GUYS GIVEN ANY
MORE THOUGHT TO YOUR ANCIENT
HISTORY PROJECTS YET?

04:48.579 --> 04:49.998
MICK?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.708
YEAH. HISTORY OF THE ROMAN
GLADIATORIAL GAMES.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.960
EXCELLENT.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.046
{\an5}WITH A PRACTICAL
DEMONSTRATION OF ME,
AS A GLADIATOR,

04:57.130 --> 05:02.093
{\an5}HUMILIATING AND DESTROYING
ALFIE IN A VERY PUBLIC
ARENA.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.679
RIGHT.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.306
FABIAN, ANY MORE THOUGHTS
ON YOUR PROJECT YET?

05:07.390 --> 05:09.809
{\an5}YEAH. ME AND NINA THOUGHT WE
MIGHT DO SOMETHING ON
EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY.

05:09.892 --> 05:13.688
{\an5}YEAH ESPECIALLY WITH ANUBIS
HOUSE BEING NAMED AFTER AN
EGYPTIAN GOD.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.440
NICE ONE NICE ONE.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.651
YOU KNOW, I'M A PARTICULAR
FAN OF EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.071
{\an5}ALL THAT INTEREST IN LIFE
AFTER DEATH AND LIVING
FOREVER.

05:22.155 --> 05:22.989
<i>UGH! WHO'D WANT TO LIVE</i>
<i>FOREVER?</i>

05:23.072 --> 05:24.615
IMAGINE HOW WRINKLED YOU'D
GET?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.159
HA!

05:26.242 --> 05:27.994
(whispers) WHAT?

05:28.077 --> 05:29.954
RIGHT. EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY
GOOD.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.414
ANYTHING ELSE? ANYONE?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.874
(whispers)
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.417
{\an5}(whispers)
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS WRONG WITH ME?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.002
{\an5}(whispers)
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA.

05:36.085 --> 05:40.715
YOU TWO, QUIET.

05:41.090 --> 05:45.720
{\an5}<i>(bell rings)</i>

05:41.090 --> 05:45.720
<i>OKAY, WE WILL CONTINUE THIS</i>
<i>SESSION AFTER LUNCH.</i>

05:45.803 --> 05:47.055
HEY AMBER

05:47.138 --> 05:48.014
CAN I...

05:48.097 --> 05:49.682
CARRY YOUR BOOKS?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.185
THANKS ALFIE. I THINK I CAN
MANAGE.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.604
ALFIE, WHAT KIND OF LINE WAS
THAT?

05:54.687 --> 05:59.609
{\an5}I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T TRY
THE CORNY OLD RED ROSE THING
AGAIN.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.778
YOU OKAY?

06:01.861 --> 06:02.612
{\an3}CONFUSED.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.655
WHAT ABOUT?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.116
JOY, NINA, THE TEACHERS

06:07.200 --> 06:10.203
{\an3}EVERYTHING.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.039
{\an3}IF I'M LATE BACK AFTER LUNCH,
WILL YOU COVER FOR ME?

06:13.122 --> 06:15.083
REMEMBER THE
HEDGEHOG INCIDENT?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.876
I'M NOT THAT GOOD
AT COVERING.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.671
HELLO, CAN I COME IN?

06:20.755 --> 06:21.714
SARAH?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.925
{\an1}OH IT'S YOU.
HAVE YOU FOUND IT YET?

06:24.008 --> 06:26.094
{\an3}FOUND WHAT?

06:26.177 --> 06:27.929
THE TREASURE.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.223
{\an3}NO, I CAME TO ASK YOU
WHERE IT IS.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.475
{\an1}YOU WON'T LET HIM FIND IT,
WILL YOU?

06:32.558 --> 06:33.976
PROMISE YOU WON'T
LET HIM FIND IT.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.145
{\an3}I PROMISE.
I PROMISE.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.439
GOOD.

06:38.523 --> 06:42.110
SARAH....

06:42.193 --> 06:44.112
WHO IS THIS?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.238
IS IT YOU?

06:45.321 --> 06:49.075
{\an3}NO, IT'S NOT ME.
SHE'S WAY TOO CUTE.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.120
<i>IT LOOKS LIKE YOU.</i>

06:52.203 --> 06:52.829
WHO'S THAT?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.081
IT'S FABIAN.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.791
SARAH MEET FABIAN.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.000
YOU MUSN'T LET HIM SEE IT.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.211
QUIKLY HIDE IT.
PLEASE PLEASE.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.338
{\an6}OKAY OKAY.
IT'S GONE. SEE,
IT'S GONE.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.007
{\an5}<i>(spooky music)</i>

07:02.421 --> 07:05.007
IT'S ALL RIGHT SARAH.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.676
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.593
GOOD.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.179
THE BLACK BIRD IS
WATCHING THE HOUSE.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.181
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.432
BLACK BIRD?

07:16.936 --> 07:19.939
I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A MISSING PERSON.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.484
HEY AMBER, CATCH.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.360
OWWW!

07:24.443 --> 07:25.236
SORRY, SORRY.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.446
ALFIE!!

07:29.448 --> 07:31.826
WHAT ON EARTH
DOES SHE SEE IN HIM?

07:31.909 --> 07:33.244
THEY SAY LOVE IS BLIND
RIGHT.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.246
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BLIND
AND HAVE NO SENSE OF SMELL.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.707
{\an3}WHY DON'T YOU GO ACROSS
AND SPEAK TO MICK?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.293
{\an1}HE LEFT ME A NOTE ASKING TO
MEET AND THEN DIDN'T TURN UP.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.712
WHY WOULD HE DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

07:42.795 --> 07:46.090
I DON'T KNOW. WHO CAN GET
INSIDE THE BRAIN OF A BOY?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.176
{\an1}NO-ONE.
IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.844
(they laugh)

07:49.927 --> 07:51.095
LOOK AT THOSE TWO LAUGHING.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.889
ARE THEY LAUGHING AT ME?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.640
GARY, PUT ME ON YEAH?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.728
{\an1}I'D WIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR
FACE IF I WERE YOU.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.313
OWW!

08:00.396 --> 08:02.231
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

08:02.315 --> 08:03.191
MICK! WHAT WAS THAT MATE?

08:03.274 --> 08:06.402
{\an5}<i>ARE YOU OKAY?</i>

08:03.274 --> 08:06.402
OWWWWWWWW!

08:06.485 --> 08:09.363
I THINK I'VE BROKEN MY
ANKLE. OWWWW!

08:09.447 --> 08:11.073
WHAT HE'S FAKING IT. I
HARDLY EVEN TOUCHED HIM.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.659
TRY TO STAND UP.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.286
OWWWWWW!

08:15.369 --> 08:18.289
{\an4}IF YOU'VE GOT THE SURNAME,
YOU CAN TRACK THEM DOWN
CAN'T YOU?

08:18.372 --> 08:19.415
{\an5}AND WHY DO YOU THINK
THIS FAMILY HAS
GONE MISSING AGAIN?

08:19.498 --> 08:24.003
NOT THE FAMILY,
JUST THE DAUGHTER.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.590
{\an5}BUT WOULDN'T THE FAMILY HAVE
FILED A MISSING PERSON'S
REPORT IF THAT WERE THE CASE?

08:27.673 --> 08:30.218
{\an1}NOT IF THEY DON'T KNOW
SHE'S GONE.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.346
{\an1}PLEASE. CAN'T YOU JUST...
FIND HER HOME ADDRESS

08:33.429 --> 08:35.347
{\an1}AND CALL HER PARENTS OR
SOMETHING.

08:35.431 --> 08:39.352
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S
MISSING OR NOT,

08:39.434 --> 08:40.895
{\an1}BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE GOING ON.

08:40.977 --> 08:45.441
{\an4}SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND AND I
KNOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN
TOUCH BY NOW.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.817
I KNOW SHE WOULD.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.694
HEY, IT'S OKAY. CALM DOWN.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.239
I'M SURE I'LL BE ABLE TO
CHECK THIS OUT FOR YOU.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.740
REALLY?

08:52.823 --> 08:53.908
REALLY.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.702
{\an1}THANK-YOU.
THANK-YOU SO MUCH.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.790
THIS BOOK ROCKS.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.960
IT'S GOT A WHOLE SECTION ON
EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.670
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY COOL
DOES IT?

09:05.753 --> 09:08.297
{\an1}SHE'S RIGHT. THIS DEFINITELY
LOOKS LIKE YOU.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.590
NO, IT DOESN'T.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.466
YES IT DOES.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.302
{\an1}LOOK, IT'S GOT THE SAME
PRETTY EYES.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.555
MY EYES ARE PRETTY HUH?

09:16.639 --> 09:20.309
{\an3}WELL... POSSIBLY
A PASSING RESEMBLANCE.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.852
BUT, THE FACT IS...

09:21.936 --> 09:24.563
{\an6}WE STILL DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE
GIRL IN THE PICTURE,

09:24.647 --> 09:25.439
OR THE TREASURE,

09:25.523 --> 09:26.857
{\an3}OR SARAH'S CONNECTION
TO THE HOUSE

09:26.941 --> 09:28.234
{\an3}OR IF SHE'S EVEN
CALLED SARAH.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.027
{\an1}YEAH, BUT ONE THING IS
FOR CERTAIN,

09:30.111 --> 09:31.362
{\an1}THIS LOCKET DEFINITELY
BELONGS TO HER

09:31.445 --> 09:32.989
{\an1}AND IT OPENS A SECRET PANEL
IN THE HOUSE.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.490
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:34.573 --> 09:36.784
{\an6}WHICH MEANS THAT SARAH
OR EMILY OR WHATEVER
SHE'S CALLED

09:36.867 --> 09:41.163
{\an6}MUST HAVE EITHER LIVED IN
OR VISITED ANUBIS HOUSE AT
SOME POINT IN THE PAST.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.666
(spooky music)

09:43.749 --> 09:45.459
{\an3}WHAT IF THE GIRL IN THE
PICTURE IS SARAH?

09:45.543 --> 09:50.256
{\an1}WHAT IF THE BLACK BIRD
IS CORBIERE?

09:50.339 --> 09:54.343
{\an6}WELL, THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE
MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT SINCE
IT'S STUFFED.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.723
IT IS A BIT WEIRD THOUGH -
ALL THIS BLACK BIRD STUFF.

09:58.806 --> 10:02.310
THIS WHOLE THING IS WEIRD.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.895
IT'S ME.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.316
I'VE HAD ONE OF JOY'S
FRIENDS IN HERE TODAY

10:08.399 --> 10:11.527
FILING A MISSING PERSON'S
REPORT.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.822
YES, PATRICIA WILLIAMSON.

10:14.905 --> 10:18.743
DO I NEED TO DO ANYTHING?

10:18.826 --> 10:22.788
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.977
WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER SUGAR
IN YOUR TEA, ALFIE?

10:45.061 --> 10:45.770
YES PLEASE.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.270
WHAT ABOUT SOME TOAST?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.731
TOAST WOULD BE NICE.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.191
OH AMBER?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.359
WITH PEANUT BUTTER?

10:51.442 --> 10:52.234
OKAY.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.653
OH AND AMBER?

10:54.737 --> 10:59.700
A LITTLE BIT OF HONEY,
HONEY.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.287
SO, MICK AND AMBER ARE
DEFINITELY FINISHED THEN?

11:03.371 --> 11:04.663
WELL, LOOKS LIKE IT.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.791
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE WENT ON
A DATE WITH ALFIE.

11:06.874 --> 11:07.750
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.920
CATS AND DOGS LIVING IN
HARMONY?

11:11.003 --> 11:12.671
I HOPE YOU'RE PLEASED WITH
YOURSELF.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.591
ALFIE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN
THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF YOU.

11:15.674 --> 11:19.387
OH PLEASE!

11:19.470 --> 11:23.265
{\an5}CAN I SEE YOUR PHONE TO LOOK
AT THE SYMBOLS, FROM THE
PAINTING.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.477
THERE YOU GO.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.815
<i>(mumbles)</i>

11:30.898 --> 11:32.608
HOW'S THAT ANKLE, ALFIE?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.818
REALLY BAD.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.778
HMM.

11:35.861 --> 11:40.116
{\an3}I THOUGHT SO, LOOK. OKAY,
THIS SYMBOL HERE,

11:40.199 --> 11:45.413
THAT MEANS TERRACED HILL
OR STAIRS.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.207
AND THIS ONE, MEANS "BURIED"
OR "UNDERNEATHî"

11:48.290 --> 11:51.293
AND THIS ONE IS
THE NUMBER 8.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.798
{\an6}SO WHAT IF THE TREASURE
IS BURIED UNDERNEATH
THE 8TH STAIR?

11:55.881 --> 11:56.799
DO YOU THINK?

11:56.882 --> 11:57.800
I DON'T KNOW.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.677
{\an3}MAYBE I'VE SEEN TOO MANY
INDIANA JONES MOVIES.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.847
{\an3}BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH
CHECKING OUT.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.434
HERE YOU GO ALFIE.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.311
THANK-YOU AMBER,
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.813
AMBER TOLD ME WHAT MICK DID.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.648
I THINK IT'S PRETTY
TERRIBLE.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.150
{\an4}AFTER WHAT ALFIE AND AMBER
DID I'M SURPRISED MICK
DIDN'T DO MORE DAMAGE.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.360
WHY, WHAT DID THEY DO?

12:16.444 --> 12:16.986
THEY WENT ON A DATE.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.029
WHAT?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

12:19.113 --> 12:20.781
{\an3}ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE SAME ALFIE?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.783
{\an1}IT WAS THE NIGHT WE WENT
UP TO THE ATTIC

12:22.867 --> 12:23.367
{\an1}REMEMBER, WE BUMPED INTO HER
IN THE CORRIDOR

12:23.451 --> 12:25.786
AND SHE WAS ALL DRESSED UP.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.955
{\an3}YEAH, FOR HER DATE WITH
MICK, NOT ALFIE.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.166
WHAT?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.834
{\an3}YEAH, SHE GOT A MESSAGE
FROM MICK,

12:31.917 --> 12:33.210
{\an3}OR AT LEAST SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS FROM HIM,

12:33.294 --> 12:34.879
{\an3}ARRANGING TO MEET IN THE
LAUNDRY ROOM,

12:34.962 --> 12:36.172
BUT HE NEVER SHOWED

12:36.255 --> 12:37.965
{\an3}SHE HAD ME LOOK AT AT LEAST
FORTY OUTFITS.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.091
REALLY?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.176
YEAH. I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

12:40.259 --> 12:44.180
FORTY OUTFITS.

12:45.222 --> 12:49.852
<i>(Patricia's cell phone rings)</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:50.394
HELLO.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.646
<i>PATRICIA WILLIAMSON?</i>

12:52.730 --> 12:54.106
YEAH?

12:54.190 --> 12:55.399
<i>SERGEANT ROEBUCK.</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:56.650
<i>I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR</i>
<i>YOU.</i>

12:56.734 --> 13:00.362
{\an5}<i>I MANAGED TO SPEAK WITH</i>
<i>JOY'S PARENTS YESTERDAY</i>
<i>EVENING</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:04.366
{\an5}AND THEY CONFIRM THAT JOY IS
SAFE AND WELL AND LIVING AT
HOME.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.661
OH! THAT'S GREAT NEWS!
THANK-YOU.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.539
SO, WHY HASN'T SHE BEEN IN
TOUCH?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.541
I'M AFRAID YOU'D HAVE TO ASK
HER THAT QUESTION.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.878
WELL, I WOULD IF I COULD GET
HOLD OF HER.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.838
CAN YOU GIVE ME
HER HOME NUMBER?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.633
I'M AFRAID I'M NOT AT
LIBERTY TO DO THAT,

13:20.716 --> 13:22.843
BUT I'M SURE JOY
WILL BE IN TOUCH,

13:22.927 --> 13:24.261
NOW SHE KNOWS HOW WORRIED
YOU'VE BEEN.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.638
YEAH. THANK-YOU....

13:25.721 --> 13:29.558
YOU'RE WELCOME.
BYE PATRICIA.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.771
<i>BYE.</i>

13:36.106 --> 13:38.400
OH. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.903
(quietly) SUCKER.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.155
HEY JEROME,

13:43.239 --> 13:44.490
{\an5}WHY ARE YOU SPREADING
RUMOURS ABOU T ALFIE AND
AMBER GOING ON A DATE?

13:44.573 --> 13:46.534
IíM NOT SPREADING RUMOURS.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.576
YES YOU ARE.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.995
{\an3}ALFIE AND AMBER ARE NOT AN
ITEM AND YOU KNOW THAT.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.248
AREN'T THEY?

13:52.331 --> 13:53.958
HAVE I GOT IT WRONG THEN?

13:54.041 --> 13:57.795
AHH WELL SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO GIVE FATE A HELPING HAND.

13:57.878 --> 13:58.837
{\an3}YOU HAVE TO TELL MICK
THE TRUTH.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.965
I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

14:01.048 --> 14:07.471
{\an4}SO HOW IS YOUR RECYCLED
HOMEWORK BUSINESS GOING THEN
JEROME?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.306
{\an3}I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.768
{\an5}I'M SURE MR SWEET WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR THRIVING
TRADE WITH THE LOWER YEARS.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.020
{\an4}HOW MUCH DO YOU EARN A MONTH
SELLING YOUR OLD HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENTS,

14:15.104 --> 14:18.983
50? 100?

14:21.986 --> 14:24.446
HEY MICK, JUST THE GUY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.284
{\an4}JEROME HERE HAS
SOMETHING HE WANTS TO TELL
YOU.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.661
NAH, I DON'T REALLY.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.079
IT ISN'T TRUE ABOUT
AMBER AND ALFIE.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.956
WHAT?

14:34.039 --> 14:36.292
WHAT I SAID ABOUT
AMBER AND ALFIE,

14:36.375 --> 14:37.918
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.628
{\an1}WHAT, ABOUT THE DATE IN THE
LAUNDRY ROOM?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.754
NEVER HAPPENED.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.631
{\an4}AMBER THOUGHT SHE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE MEETING YOU
THERE.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.969
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.930
YOU LITTLE!!!

14:55.936 --> 14:58.439
{\an1}OKAY, I GOT IT SERIOUSLY
WRONG BABE.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.315
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY,

14:59.398 --> 15:00.983
{\an1}IíM SORRY I DIDN'T SHOW UP
ON THE DATE,

15:01.066 --> 15:02.693
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW,..

15:02.776 --> 15:05.029
{\an1}FORGET ABOUT IT,
IT'S TOO COMPLICATED.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.488
HERE I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.658
{\an3}<i>(gasp)</i>
OH MICK I LOVE IT.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.535
OH, IT'S A SHELL.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.703
FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN,

15:12.786 --> 15:14.913
{\an1}REMEMBER I WENT THERE
LAST SUMMER

15:14.997 --> 15:17.041
I HAD TO DIVE REALLY,
REALLY DEEP TO GET IT.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.125
IT WAS PRETTY EXTREME.

15:18.208 --> 15:18.792
REALLY,

15:18.876 --> 15:21.128
{\an3}YOU ALMOST DIED...
FOR ME?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.339
OKAY.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.799
OH MICK!

15:25.883 --> 15:29.053
<i>(playfighting yelps)</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:32.514
SO, ARE WE STILL ON
FOR TONIGHT?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.433
I BROUGHT MY BIKE TOOLS IN.

15:34.516 --> 15:35.184
WHAT FOR?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.520
{\an3}PRYING UP FLOORBOARDS.
WHAT ELSE?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.022
YES! I'VE HAD AN EMAIL
FROM JOY!!!

15:40.105 --> 15:42.900
{\an5}REALLY?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.900
THAT IS GREAT.

15:44.109 --> 15:44.943
WHAT DOES SHE SAY?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.362
<i>(girly voice)</i>
"HI PATRICIA".

15:46.445 --> 15:48.530
HANG ON, I'LL READ IT.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.698
"HI PATRICIA "

15:49.782 --> 15:50.616
{\an3}THAT SETTLES IT,
I'M PSYCHIC.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.951
"SORRY I HAVEN'T
BEEN IN TOUCH.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.119
IT'S BEEN HECTIC
SINCE I LEFT.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.122
ANYWAY, JUST WANTED TO LET
YOU KNOW THAT I'M FINE.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.542
{\an5}I KNOW IT PROBABLY SEEMED A
BIT ODD OF ME DISAPPEARING
LIKE THAT,

16:00.626 --> 16:04.838
{\an5}BUT DAD'S BUSINESS WENT
UNDER AND HE NEEDED TO GET
ME OUT OF THERE ASAP

16:04.922 --> 16:06.048
I WAS A BIT SHOCKED MYSELF.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.967
HOPE YOU ARE ALL OKAY AND
NOT MISSING ME TOO MUCH.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.053
LOVE JOY."

16:11.136 --> 16:13.305
THERE'S NO SMILEY FACE
AT THE END.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.557
JOY ALWAYS PUTS
A SMILEY FACE;

16:15.641 --> 16:16.767
AND THERE'S NO TEXT SPEAK,

16:16.850 --> 16:18.769
IT'S ALL WRITTEN OUT
LIKE,.. PROPERLY.

16:18.852 --> 16:22.773
{\an1}JOY'S LEARNED TO SPELL
AT LAST. HURRAY!

16:22.856 --> 16:24.191
AND IT'S FROM A NEW
EMAIL ADDRESS?

16:24.274 --> 16:29.738
{\an6}SOMETIMES I USE TEXT SPEAK
IN EMAILS AND SOMETIMES
I DON'T.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.743
{\an4}AND A NEW EMAIL ADDRESS
MAKES SENSE IF SHE'S
MOVED HOUSE.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.245
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.164
SORRY. I BET I'VE BEEN
DRIVING YOU ALL CRAZY.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.708
{\an5}NO!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.708
YES!

16:40.791 --> 16:42.751
ESPECIALLY YOU NINA.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.504
NOTHING A FEW YEARS OF
COUNSELLING WON'T FIX.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.257
I GUESS I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
THINGS A LITTLE TOO FAR.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.967
IT'S REALLY OKAY, PATRICIA.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.051
YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR
FRIEND.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.261
I'M JUST GLAD SHE'S SAFE.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.097
{\an5}CAN SOMEBODY HELP ME TAKE
THIS FOOD TO THE TABLE
PLEASE?

16:55.180 --> 16:59.101
COMING!

16:59.184 --> 17:03.105
{\an4}WOW! I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN PATRICIA'S ATTEMPT AT
AN APOLOGY.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.023
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.403
HEY GUYS GUESS WHAT, MICK
AND I HAVE MADE UP.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.237
AW THAT'S GREAT GUYS.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.073
AND WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
TO CELEBRATE.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.117
TOMORROW NIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL INVITED.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.952
<i>(sarcastically)</i>
GREAT!

17:17.035 --> 17:19.246

MISUNDERSTANDING.

{\an5}I MEAN, AS IF I WOULD EVER
FANCY ALFIE OR MICK
FANCY YOU,

17:24.292 --> 17:25.877
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.714
AND HE HAS BEEN SOOO SWEET
ALL EVENING.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.800
AND DID I SHOW YOU WHAT
HE GOT ME?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.051
ELEVEN TIMES.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.180
DID I TELL YOU, HE ALMOST
DIED GETTING THIS FOR ME?

17:36.263 --> 17:39.141
FOURTEEN TIMES.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.143
OH, ARE YOU TIRED MARA?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.311
DEAD TIRED.

17:42.394 --> 17:46.815

EMOTIONAL DAY.

NO WAIT.

18:41.286 --> 18:45.165
YES!

18:45.249 --> 18:47.668

18:47.751 --> 18:49.711

20:09.917 --> 20:12.252

20:12.336 --> 20:14.296
SORRY SWEETIE. SORRY.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.716

I CAN'T GET INTO THIS
