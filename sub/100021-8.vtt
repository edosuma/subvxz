44:13.160 --> 44:15.899
Not everyone gets to have that.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.359
Why can't you?

44:17.360 --> 44:20.199
Leap and the net will appear.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.799
- Isn't that what Jerome told you?
- [SIGHS]

44:21.800 --> 44:23.536
It's good advice.

44:24.800 --> 44:28.220
If you like this man, go be with him.

44:29.260 --> 44:32.329
Dumping him out of
fear of losing control

44:32.330 --> 44:34.289
just makes you a dope.

44:34.290 --> 44:36.879
[SIGHS]

44:36.880 --> 44:38.840
You're not a dope.

44:45.840 --> 44:48.889
Marjorie, Marjorie, come on.

44:48.890 --> 44:52.539
<i>I'm gonna make this short
because time is not my friend,</i>

44:52.540 --> 44:56.349
<i>it's not yours,
and it's definitely not... </i>

44:56.350 --> 44:57.946

- [MUFFLED SCREAMING]</i>

44:57.947 --> 44:59.449
Oh, Jesus!

44:59.450 --> 45:01.149
You call the police,

45:01.150 --> 45:02.459
we kill her.

45:02.460 --> 45:04.449
Simple as fucking that.

45:04.450 --> 45:06.039
<i>Do we want to kill her?</i>

45:06.040 --> 45:08.369
<i>No, no, we don't. It's messy.</i>

45:08.370 --> 45:11.539
What I want is the John
Rothstein books...

45:11.540 --> 45:13.085
I don't have the fucking books!

45:13.086 --> 45:17.839
Which your little prick
fuck of a son has.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.699
You make contact with
the little pricky-dicky-do,

45:20.700 --> 45:23.629
and you tell him to deal with us.

45:23.630 --> 45:25.764
<i>You need to give your
son some good advice.</i>

45:25.765 --> 45:27.389
Nobody has to die here.

<i>We just want the books.</i>
