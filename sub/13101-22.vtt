00:02.042 --> 00:04.625
[instrumental music]

00:09.167 --> 00:13.000
(man over radio)
'Shuttle one to C and C.
The package is on its way in.'

00:13.083 --> 00:14.375
(woman over radio)
'Confirmed, shuttle one.'

00:25.500 --> 00:28.542
[crowd cheering]

00:34.833 --> 00:37.375
Hang on, hang on.

00:37.458 --> 00:38.583
Welcome home.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.750
Uh, this was
your idea, wasn't it?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.792
Well, we figured
you'd probably wanna come back

00:42.875 --> 00:44.625
with as little
fanfare as possible.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.625
Your usual low key approach.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.500
But there's a time
and a place for everything.

00:48.583 --> 00:51.458
And this is the time
and this is definitely the place

00:51.542 --> 00:53.875
for one hell of a party.

00:53.958 --> 00:56.000
[crowd cheering]

00:59.167 --> 01:02.042
Mr. President,
we have a lot to celebrate

01:02.125 --> 01:04.667
including and especially
your marriage.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.208
And you two
just can't avoid it.

01:07.292 --> 01:08.417
If I could find some way

01:08.500 --> 01:10.458
to pay you back for this,
I will.

01:10.542 --> 01:12.000
[laughs]

01:12.083 --> 01:13.458
Thank you.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.833
[cheering]

01:22.000 --> 01:25.083
So, doctor, who died?

01:26.958 --> 01:28.333
What are you talkin' about?

01:28.417 --> 01:31.542
Among my people, this is how
we celebrate state funerals.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.625
Our marriage ceremonies
are solemn, sober..

01:34.708 --> 01:36.667
...moments of reflection.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.083
Also regret,
disagreement, argument

01:40.167 --> 01:42.042
and mutual recrimination.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.167
Once you know that
it cannot get any worse

01:44.250 --> 01:46.125
you can relax
and enjoy the marriage.

01:46.208 --> 01:49.208
But to start
with something like this?

01:49.292 --> 01:51.833
No, it is a very bad sign
for the future.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.750
[chuckles]

02:00.208 --> 02:02.250
Perhaps it was
something I said.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.708
Perhaps it is
everything you say.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.958
I knew we should have
gone to Minbar first.

02:16.042 --> 02:18.958
[sighs]
Well, I suppose
we can't blame them.

02:19.042 --> 02:21.375
I mean, Clark's gone,
Earth and Mars are free.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.375
They wanna celebrate.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.917
I guess they see us
as a symbol of that.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.125
They should be applauding
themselves, not us.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.792
We did it together.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.250
But I think th-there's
something immodest about all--

02:32.333 --> 02:34.458
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about it.

02:34.542 --> 02:38.583
What matters is what
we did here together.

02:38.667 --> 02:41.667
In a hundred years,
it won't matter who we were.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.625
They probably
won't even remember.

02:43.708 --> 02:45.208
That's true.

02:45.292 --> 02:46.792
Ohh.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.417
(man on radio)
'And here's our first shot
of the first couple'

02:57.500 --> 03:00.000
'of the Interstellar Alliance,

03:00.083 --> 03:02.875
'and Delenn, live on ISN.'

'and most worlds in the former

'ISN coverage..'

'Continuity error

'Correcting for error.'

03:17.917 --> 03:19.875
'Resetting.
Do you wish to continue?'

03:21.292 --> 03:24.333
'Reloading sequence,

'Please select a time period

'Please stand by to receive.'

03:38.917 --> 03:41.833
[theme music]

03:41.917 --> 03:43.792
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.750
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.458
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.625
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.792
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.500
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

03:54.583 --> 03:55.875
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

03:55.958 --> 03:57.708
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.792
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.875
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:05.083 --> 04:08.958
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.
The place..

04:09.042 --> 04:10.875
(Sheridan)
"Babylon 5."

04:12.792 --> 04:15.583
[theme music]

04:47.292 --> 04:49.375
[music continues]

05:09.875 --> 05:11.458
'Stand by.'

05:13.333 --> 05:15.042
(male announcer)
'ISN Nightside.'

05:15.125 --> 05:17.458
'A no holds barred look
at the events of today'

05:17.542 --> 05:19.750
'that will shape
the world of tomorrow.'

05:19.833 --> 05:21.708
'And now your host
Derek Mitchell.'

05:21.792 --> 05:23.208
Good evening.

05:23.292 --> 05:26.042
By any definition, the events
of the last few weeks

05:26.125 --> 05:29.333
have been among the most
remarkable in recent memory.

05:29.417 --> 05:32.000
The end of a civil war
that split Earthforce

05:32.083 --> 05:34.875
squarely down the middle,
the death of President

05:34.958 --> 05:39.208
William Morgan Clark,
the birth of an independent Mars

05:39.292 --> 05:43.125
and the creation of a new
Interstellar Alliance.

05:43.208 --> 05:46.333
It can be more than
a little overwhelming.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.250
However, there's a word
in the old testament

05:50.333 --> 05:55.000
used to call for silence
"Selah."

05:55.083 --> 05:58.083
It means, "pause and consider."

05:58.167 --> 05:59.917
So tonight,
starting with a report

06:00.000 --> 06:02.750
from special correspondent
Jim Bitterbane

06:02.833 --> 06:06.458
and a word or ten
from our usual panel of experts

06:06.542 --> 06:07.917
we've set aside a few moments

06:08.000 --> 06:13.167
to reflect, discuss,
pause, and consider.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.625
Selah.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.458
Greatness is a quality
that is often sought

06:16.542 --> 06:19.792
by those who want it most,
but are the least worthy.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.292
Correspondingly, greatness
is sometimes thrust upon

06:22.375 --> 06:25.458
those who want it least
but are the most deserving.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.000
These words would seem
to best describe

06:27.083 --> 06:28.375
Captain John J. Sheridan

06:28.458 --> 06:30.208
both in the way
he came into the world

06:30.292 --> 06:32.375
and as the position
that he currently occupies

06:32.458 --> 06:35.833
as that of the president of
the new Interstellar Alliance.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.250
(Jim)
The only son of
a career diplomat

06:38.333 --> 06:41.125
Sheridan was an average
but enthusiastic student.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.167
He drifted in and out
of various hobbies

06:43.250 --> 06:44.917
including a brief
but obsessive interest

06:45.000 --> 06:46.708
in the works
of the Dalai Lama

06:46.792 --> 06:49.542
before entering Earthforce
shortly after the Dilgar War.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.417
He served with distinction
during the Minbari War

06:52.500 --> 06:54.458
and the food riots on Mars.

06:54.542 --> 06:58.125
Quite a change from those
early, unremarkable years

06:58.208 --> 07:00.833
and the man who came to Earth
leading a fleet

07:00.917 --> 07:02.667
and carrying an ultimatum.

07:02.750 --> 07:06.083
But now, an even greater
challenge stands before him.

07:06.167 --> 07:09.167
Can he hold together
this newborn alliance

07:09.250 --> 07:12.625
of competing,
even mutually hostile races?

07:12.708 --> 07:13.667
Derek?

07:13.750 --> 07:15.042
Thank you, Jim.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.917
We'll now turn to our panel
of experts for their thoughts.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.917
From Earthdome,
Senator Elizabeth Metarie.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.958
From Mars, author
and journalist, Leif Tanner.

07:27.042 --> 07:30.292
And from Paris, Henry Ellis,
former speech writer

07:30.375 --> 07:32.000
and political commentator.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.542
Gentlemen, senator, welcome.

07:33.625 --> 07:34.833
(all)
'Thank you, Derek.'

07:34.917 --> 07:36.167
Well, I don't know
which of you wants

07:36.250 --> 07:37.458
to be first
out of the gate on this--

07:37.542 --> 07:38.583
I'd like to jump
in here, Derek.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.667
(Derek)
'Alright.'

07:39.750 --> 07:41.542
What amazes me is the way

07:41.625 --> 07:43.542
that everyone has tried
to turn Sheridan

07:43.625 --> 07:46.042
into some kind of hero.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.917
This is the man who resigned
his commission in Earthforce

07:49.000 --> 07:50.375
under dubious circumstances--

07:50.458 --> 07:53.042
The president cleared him
and his crew, Henry

07:53.125 --> 07:55.292
and she called him
the hero of the hour.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.542
(Henry)
'Yes, she did.'

07:56.625 --> 07:58.375
And she's gonna have
to answer for that

07:58.458 --> 07:59.583
in the next election.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.875
But, but that's
besides the point.

08:01.958 --> 08:04.708
Now there was obviously
some sort of deal made there

08:04.792 --> 08:07.125
which is how he got out of there
with his hide in one piece.

08:07.208 --> 08:10.208
I mean, call me old fashioned
but that doesn't sound

08:10.292 --> 08:13.333
like the best qualification
to run a major alliance.

08:13.417 --> 08:16.042
Sounds to me like most of
the generals and politicians

08:16.125 --> 08:17.958
who've made history
in the last few hundred years.

08:18.042 --> 08:19.083
(Henry)
'Oh, come on.'

08:19.167 --> 08:20.625
Let's look at the facts.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.208
The man isn't qualified
to run an operation

08:23.292 --> 08:25.750
as large as this
Interstellar Alliance.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.125
He could barely keep
Babylon 5 operational

08:28.208 --> 08:29.708
without shootin'
at everything in sight--

08:29.792 --> 08:31.167
(Leif)
'Oh, that's an exaggeration.'

08:31.250 --> 08:33.417
He can barely get along
with his own race

08:33.500 --> 08:35.708
and now he's gonna stitch
together an alliance

08:35.792 --> 08:38.833
of radically different aliens
and make it work?

08:38.917 --> 08:41.042
No, this whole shebang
is doomed from the get go.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.083
Why not at least
let him try to prove

08:43.167 --> 08:44.667
if he can do it or not,
before you subject him--

08:44.750 --> 08:45.917
(Henry)
'With what's at stake?'

08:46.000 --> 08:47.792
(Leif)
'I agree with the senator.'

08:47.875 --> 08:49.333
Give Sheridan a break.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.417
To write him off
before he's even started.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.167
Well, that's irrational,
even for you, Henry.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.833
[laughs]
He fires on his own ships and
you're callin' me irrational?

08:57.917 --> 08:58.958
Come on, Leif.

08:59.042 --> 09:00.917
(Leif)
'That's-that's not fair--'

09:01.000 --> 09:02.250
(Derek)
'I beg your pardon.'

09:02.333 --> 09:04.792
Do you actually believe
the alliance will work?

09:04.875 --> 09:06.125
I don't know
if it will work.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.958
I'm just saying
that he deserves a chance

09:09.042 --> 09:10.292
to try and make it work.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.958
Uh, what I think is missing
and being lost

09:13.042 --> 09:14.208
in this whole discussion

09:14.292 --> 09:16.208
is that this is
an election year.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.917
And that Mr. Ellis
was working as a speech writer

09:19.000 --> 09:20.167
in the Clark administration.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.792
And I think that he
and others of his party

09:22.875 --> 09:25.208
consider Sheridan a real threat
to their hopes

09:25.292 --> 09:26.792
for a majority in the senate.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.875
So they're doing all that they
can to discredit him in advance.

09:29.958 --> 09:31.292
(Henry)
'That is completely unfair.'

09:31.375 --> 09:33.458
It is not unfair.
It's true, Henry.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.167
I-I hate to interrupt you
at this point

09:35.250 --> 09:36.958
but we're coming up
on a commercial break.

09:37.042 --> 09:38.833
So why don't each of you
give me your calls

09:38.917 --> 09:42.000
for the next couple of years,
uh, on the following.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.625
Can Sheridan and his people
make a go of this new alliance?

09:44.708 --> 09:46.125
- 'Yes.'
- 'Absolutely.'

09:46.208 --> 09:47.875
Do you think they'll make
any difference whatever?

09:47.958 --> 09:49.333
And what do you consider

09:49.417 --> 09:52.125
to be the number one problem
waiting for them?

09:52.208 --> 09:53.417
[clamoring]

09:53.500 --> 09:55.417
Ah, ah, ah.
Mr. Tanner.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.167
From where I sit, they've
already made a difference.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.292
The senate has been
debating what to do

10:00.375 --> 10:03.125
about Mars for years
and did nothing.

10:03.208 --> 10:06.792
It took Sheridan
to push them into recognizing

10:06.875 --> 10:09.500
our sovereign rights
of independence.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.000
(Henry)
'At gunpoint.'

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
Senator?

10:12.625 --> 10:14.833
Obviously there's
a degree of uncertainty

10:14.917 --> 10:17.250
in any new political situation.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.000
This next year will prove
critical for Sheridan

10:20.083 --> 10:21.333
and the rest of his people.

10:21.417 --> 10:22.833
Look at what
they're up against.

10:22.917 --> 10:26.333
He has to ride herd
on a dozen or so alien races

10:26.417 --> 10:27.792
that've signed
on to this alliance

10:27.875 --> 10:29.958
and probably
don't fully understand

10:30.042 --> 10:31.542
what's being required of them.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.833
There's still sporadic fighting
between many of those members.

10:34.917 --> 10:38.375
On top of that, he has supply
problems, telepath problems

10:38.458 --> 10:42.083
raiding parties, not to mention
distrust among elements

10:42.167 --> 10:43.875
of his own government
here at home.

10:43.958 --> 10:45.708
This man has his work
cut out for him.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.542
But I know
that he can handle it.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.708
Mr. Ellis, last words.

10:50.792 --> 10:55.750
Whatever Sheridan and Delenn say
about this economic alliance

10:55.833 --> 10:58.958
he's going to have to apply
military force to make it work.

10:59.042 --> 11:00.125
[clamoring]

11:00.208 --> 11:01.625
Now, let me finish.

11:01.708 --> 11:04.000
I didn't interrupt you people
when you were talking.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.042
Now when this happens,
it's all gonna fall apart.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.000
He's power hungry
and he's unprepared.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.042
And that is a dangerous
combination.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.250
(Leif)
'Dangerous combination!
That's what leaders--'

11:13.333 --> 11:15.792
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.083
We'll be back in just a moment

11:17.167 --> 11:19.417
to consider
the political implications

11:19.500 --> 11:21.208
of this new
Interstellar Alliance

11:21.292 --> 11:23.417
and the recent calls
for the formation

11:23.500 --> 11:26.667
of independent
political parties on Mars.

12:09.417 --> 12:10.792
Good morning.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.792
We seem to have roughly half
a million students and faculty

12:12.875 --> 12:14.708
on line today,
waiting with questions

12:14.792 --> 12:16.542
which is a little more
than we expected.

12:16.625 --> 12:19.875
So if the system runs
a little slow, bear with us.

12:19.958 --> 12:24.125
Our first question, from Ray
Winston, University of Kiev.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.542
"What role do you feel
the Babylon station played

12:26.625 --> 12:28.625
in the creation of
the 100 year peace?"

12:28.708 --> 12:30.000
Well, the station,
none at all.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.542
It's a place, was a place

12:31.625 --> 12:33.125
that served as a nexus
for others.

12:33.208 --> 12:34.375
- I agree.
- 'A nexus how?'

12:34.458 --> 12:36.042
Well, the first thing
you have to do

12:36.125 --> 12:38.167
is separate fantasy
from reality.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.875
The publicity machine
for the Alliance

12:39.958 --> 12:42.125
would have you believe that
somehow all this came about

12:42.208 --> 12:44.167
because of what
a few people did.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.625
'But large political movements'

12:45.708 --> 12:48.083
are rarely the work
of any one person.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.750
The individual at the center
gives permission

12:49.833 --> 12:52.083
for others to act,
can inspire others

12:52.167 --> 12:54.125
but the individual
really cannot effect change

12:54.208 --> 12:55.500
as an act of will.

12:55.583 --> 12:58.000
They did not do,
they allowed others to do.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.792
By "they" you mean
Sheridan and Delenn?

12:59.875 --> 13:01.917
We all have a profound
psychological need to

13:02.000 --> 13:04.833
believe in heroes, the shining
knight on the white horse.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.042
If they don't exist,
we create them.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.667
Sheridan and Delenn
are two classic examples.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.708
If you look at the social
dynamic around them

13:11.792 --> 13:13.875
they actually
didn't do anything.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.417
They were the open vessels

13:15.500 --> 13:17.667
in which people poured
their hopes and their dreams.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.042
That sets up
sort of a gestalt

13:20.125 --> 13:22.625
where events take on
a life of their own.

13:22.708 --> 13:25.083
So you think the record of their
accomplishments is overrated?

13:25.167 --> 13:26.292
(William)
'Absolutely.'

13:26.375 --> 13:27.708
Good PR, as Tashaki said.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.708
In a lot of ways, they blew it.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.250
It was only the force of history
that saved the situation

13:32.333 --> 13:34.542
from collapsing of its own
weight after so many people

13:34.625 --> 13:36.208
died in its first year
of operation.

13:36.292 --> 13:37.917
And the incident
concerning their son--

13:38.000 --> 13:39.042
I don't want to get
off the track

13:39.125 --> 13:40.333
and into associated biography.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.458
So let's move on
to the next question.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.750
"If your assumption is correct,
where did Sheridan and Delenn

13:46.833 --> 13:48.042
and those involved go wrong?"

13:48.125 --> 13:49.542
Where do you start?

13:49.625 --> 13:52.000
I started to say, so many
people died in the year

13:52.083 --> 13:54.625
after Sheridan and Delenn
returned to Babylon 5.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.417
Well, you can't lay the blame
for all that at their feet.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.833
(William)
'Of course you can.'

13:57.917 --> 13:59.333
Well, as one example,
they had no business

13:59.417 --> 14:01.792
creating a colony
of telepaths on Babylon 5.

14:01.875 --> 14:02.958
He as much as said later

14:03.042 --> 14:05.000
it was the worst mistake
of his career.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.917
He thought they could
control the telepaths

14:07.000 --> 14:08.917
when any fool knows
that's impossible.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.583
Sooner or later,
they were bound to turn on

14:10.667 --> 14:12.125
Sheridan and everybody else.

14:12.208 --> 14:13.500
And that's exactly
what happened.

14:13.583 --> 14:14.917
I have to agree.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
That one event may have done
much to precipitate

14:17.083 --> 14:18.667
the telepath war and--

14:18.750 --> 14:20.500
'You can't pick one incident
and say that was the cause--'

14:20.583 --> 14:22.000
Not the sole cause, no.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.083
But it was
a contributing factor.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.250
[sighs]

14:25.333 --> 14:26.333
I'd like to turn
our attention now

14:26.417 --> 14:27.792
to this historical record.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.375
It's from later in 2262

14:29.458 --> 14:31.958
just after the creation
of the Interstellar Alliance.

14:32.042 --> 14:35.167
I'd like to get
your comments on it.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.000
(Garibaldi)
'You gotta listen to me.'

14:37.083 --> 14:39.458
This isn't gonna work.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.458
If you give yourselves up,
we could go back, we could talk

14:41.542 --> 14:42.875
to the others.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.750
Alright, you say
you're doin' this for a cause.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.125
What kind of sympathy
are you gonna get

14:51.208 --> 14:53.708
by killing innocent people
in cold blood?

14:55.125 --> 14:58.792
You wanna send out a message,
this ain't it.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.083
Look, I can work with you.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.250
I can get you out of this.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.125
But you've gotta work
with me.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.167
What do you say?

15:10.208 --> 15:12.167
Oh, yeah.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.667
That's what I thought
you were gonna say.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.042
This is President Sheridan.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.958
I have consulted
with Captain Lochley

15:19.042 --> 15:23.125
and we have reached a decision
regarding the current situation.

15:23.208 --> 15:26.167
It is not the policy of
the Interstellar Alliance

15:26.250 --> 15:29.042
or this station
to bargain with terrorists

15:29.125 --> 15:31.542
for the lives of hostages.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.042
If we open that door
even once

15:33.125 --> 15:35.917
we will never be able
to close it again.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.750
Now you have two choices,
surrender

15:39.833 --> 15:43.667
or we will use lethal force
to bring you down.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.583
You have ten minutes.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.333
Swell.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.167
Oh, whoa.
Wait, look, we can--

15:54.250 --> 15:55.333
[zapping]

15:55.417 --> 15:57.250
Comments?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.167
Well, I don't know what
more needs to be said.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.000
These pictures speak
for themselves.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.875
Sheridan was clearly
pathological.

16:02.958 --> 16:04.708
(Latimere)
'Well, to be fair, most
governments take that position.'

16:04.792 --> 16:06.125
No, I'm not debating that.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.500
But you can see it
in his attitude.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.375
The way he addresses
the terrorists.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.125
That coldness is emblematic
of his personality.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.875
He was power hungry,
it's as simple as that.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.458
And he never let
anything get in his way.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.042
Dr. Tashaki?

16:18.125 --> 16:19.750
A truly pathological
individual

16:19.833 --> 16:22.167
could never have constructed
a mythos around himself

16:22.250 --> 16:23.625
the way Sheridan did.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.583
It's a very sophisticated
PR campaign.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.125
Brilliantly done.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.375
And then there's that bit about
the way his death was handled.

16:29.458 --> 16:30.542
Exactly.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.542
Everyone knows
Sheridan died on Minbar.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.875
The cover story they put out
was clearly designed

16:34.958 --> 16:36.917
to perpetuate the myth
of his character.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.333
And I guess it worked

16:38.417 --> 16:41.417
'cause a lot of people still
believe it 80 years later.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.375
So, where do the two of you
fall on the Delenn question?

16:45.458 --> 16:47.625
Well, everyone knows
Minbari live a long time.

16:47.708 --> 16:48.708
But not that long.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.125
I think the record
is 120 years.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.542
A 140? Forget it.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.917
This is just what Dr. Tashaki
was talking about earlier.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.333
This constant perpetuation
of fantasy.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.000
The idea that Delenn
is still around after this long

17:00.083 --> 17:01.375
and living in seclusion

17:01.458 --> 17:03.333
so, of course,
no one can see her.

17:03.417 --> 17:04.958
It's very convenient.

17:05.042 --> 17:07.583
The Alliance is continuing the
illusion that Delenn is alive

17:07.667 --> 17:08.833
for their own purposes.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.750
Frankly, I don't think
she would have approved.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.417
Apparently they feel
they have to maintain

17:12.500 --> 17:14.750
this fiction in order to keep
their people in line.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.375
If the Alliance and the Rangers
are as strong as they say

17:17.458 --> 17:20.750
they don't need the security
blanket of lies and myth.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.833
Looking back, has the Alliance
been a force for good?

17:24.917 --> 17:26.917
Well, for the most part, yes.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.667
Although good things can grow
in questionable ground.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.250
I think it's clear
that the motives of those

17:31.333 --> 17:33.208
at the birth of the Alliance
were not as pure

17:33.292 --> 17:36.750
as their biographers
and allies would suggest.

17:36.833 --> 17:38.833
The force of history is
what moves us forward.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.917
Our common shared destiny.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.208
The individual does not
move society forward.

17:43.292 --> 17:46.917
To give them undue credit
is immodest and impertinent.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.708
Sheridan was a megalomaniac

17:48.792 --> 17:50.833
and to allow history
to feed that megalomania

17:50.917 --> 17:53.958
even posthumously,
simply compounds the error.

17:54.042 --> 17:55.833
We have an obligation
as academics

17:55.917 --> 17:58.417

we'd like to know.

...you ignore because
it is inconvenient.

do not know...you invent!

cared nothing for him.

expect you to say that.

21:43.292 --> 21:48.750
and destruction of original
Babylon 5 station 480 years ago.

21:50.083 --> 21:54.250
To recap for
politdivision central..

21:54.333 --> 21:55.708
...the purpose of
this simulation

21:55.792 --> 21:58.000
is to provide
reverse correct infospeak

21:58.083 --> 22:02.042
as support for current
changes in Earth policy.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.667
It is the new policy that
the Interstellar Alliance

22:04.750 --> 22:09.167
is restrictive and against
the best interests of Earth.

22:09.250 --> 22:12.792
Intent is to deconstruct
historical figures revered

22:12.875 --> 22:15.750
by prole sector,
thereby legitimizing

22:15.833 --> 22:18.042
current government policies.

22:20.042 --> 22:23.917
Initiating phase 2
of re-creation.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.583
To determine if the
psychohistorical research

22:27.667 --> 22:29.083
has been sufficiently thorough

22:29.167 --> 22:31.583
phase 2 will begin with
the control holograms

22:31.667 --> 22:33.750
workin' with the actual
psychological makeups

22:33.833 --> 22:35.500
of the subjects in question.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.833
The holograms will thus
perform in a fashion

22:39.917 --> 22:42.250
consistent with real fact.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.208
Program starts...now.

22:46.292 --> 22:48.667
Do you know where you are?

22:48.750 --> 22:50.000
Babylon 5.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.875
The, the conference room,
level blue 3.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.958
And what year is it?

22:55.042 --> 22:56.750
Twenty two sixty two.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.167
(Daniel)
'Very good.'

22:59.250 --> 23:00.667
The next step
is to determine

23:00.750 --> 23:02.792
how well the system
can be modified.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.000
Computer.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.333
Update system files
for holographic figures

23:06.417 --> 23:10.542
filling in period
from 2262 through 2762.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.417
(automated message)
'Stand by.'

23:12.500 --> 23:15.333
The system is now updating
the holographic representations

23:15.417 --> 23:17.042
with our current
political situation

23:17.125 --> 23:19.792
and the developments
leading up to them.

23:19.875 --> 23:22.167
'This will demonstrate
system flexibility'

23:22.250 --> 23:24.417
and capacity
to spontaneously emote

23:24.500 --> 23:26.958
to changes in programming.

23:27.042 --> 23:28.542
Download complete.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.167
Well..

23:32.375 --> 23:34.708
Five hundred years?

23:34.792 --> 23:36.542
- Are we..
- Yes.

23:36.625 --> 23:40.333
You, the real you
are deceased.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.500
We have reconstructed
your thought patterns

23:42.583 --> 23:44.125
and your forms for purposes

23:44.208 --> 23:45.875
of a series of vids
designed to help--

23:45.958 --> 23:48.542
Designed as propaganda
to justify your break

23:48.625 --> 23:50.250
from the Interstellar Alliance.

23:53.458 --> 23:54.875
Not propaganda.

23:54.958 --> 23:58.208
Good facts...as opposed
to real facts.

23:58.292 --> 24:01.875
Facts the government
has endorsed.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.667
I don't get it.
Why are you doing this?

24:03.750 --> 24:06.333
Why the break
with the Alliance?

24:06.417 --> 24:09.708
Five hundred years
of working with the Alliance

24:09.792 --> 24:11.833
has weakened
the position of humans

24:11.917 --> 24:13.667
in the greater
scheme of things.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.333
We have lost our uniqueness.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.750
We have been polluted
by too many outside ideas.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.833
That's a great story.

24:22.917 --> 24:25.750
I'm sure that's the one
you're putting out.

24:25.833 --> 24:28.083
What's the real one?

24:28.167 --> 24:29.917
The real fact,
not the good fact.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.708
Earth needs room to expand.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.125
The Rangers and the Alliance
prove a hindrance

24:35.208 --> 24:36.958
to our plans to expand.

24:38.042 --> 24:39.875
Can't you see?

24:42.833 --> 24:43.917
They've recreated us

24:44.000 --> 24:45.583
so that they can provide
false records

24:45.667 --> 24:49.042
and, uh, portray us to be
what? Uh, the bad guys?

24:49.125 --> 24:51.750
Only out for interests
of our own?

24:51.833 --> 24:54.083
They want to undermine
the Alliance

24:54.167 --> 24:56.333
by attacking the people
who created it.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.583
Looks like.

24:57.667 --> 24:58.958
Just a second.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.292
I'm remembering things
I never saw.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.167
Those are the records
they downloaded to us.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.833
Th-there's another force
out there.

25:08.917 --> 25:10.917
Earthgov is split.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.083
The two sides are-are fighting
each other over..

25:15.167 --> 25:18.000
...land and resources,
power.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.000
We're on the cusp
of another civil war.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.792
You know, he's right.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.458
I'm gettin' it, too.

25:31.042 --> 25:33.583
That's the reason for the
planned invasion, isn't it?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.583
They wanna take over
several colony worlds

25:37.667 --> 25:39.417
that've gone over
to the opposition

25:39.500 --> 25:41.500
which is still loyal
to the Alliance.

25:41.583 --> 25:45.125
(Daniel)
Your legacy has proven
a hindrance to that intention.

25:45.208 --> 25:48.333
Therefore you must
be...deconstructed.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.292
Initiating phase three.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.625
Good fact scenario
ready for testing.

25:56.708 --> 25:58.208
Look, if you think
this is going to work--

25:58.292 --> 26:00.500
Engaging reprogram.

26:00.583 --> 26:01.958
You may proceed.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.083
Welcome to Babylon 5.

26:10.458 --> 26:13.167
I understand that you
surrendered to our forces

26:13.250 --> 26:16.250
in the hopes
of finding mercy.

26:18.083 --> 26:22.917
The Interstellar Alliance is not
here to be merciful to the weak.

26:25.042 --> 26:29.917
In all the universe there are
only 2 kinds, the conquerors..

26:30.000 --> 26:31.292
...and the conquered.

26:32.417 --> 26:34.167
Through your blood

26:34.250 --> 26:35.667
'and the blood
of your children'

26:35.750 --> 26:38.250
we will blaze a path
across the galaxy!

26:38.333 --> 26:40.167
What we cannot take
by force

26:40.250 --> 26:43.375
we will win...by subversion.

26:45.292 --> 26:48.208
And in the end,
we will bury you.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.375
Your lives are not the first

26:52.458 --> 26:53.833
and they will not be
the last.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.958
If a billion must die

26:56.042 --> 26:59.958
to ensure the continuance
of our empire, then so be it!

27:10.083 --> 27:14.417
You are only...a down payment.

27:17.458 --> 27:19.208
Stand ready!

27:22.792 --> 27:24.958
Aim!

27:25.042 --> 27:26.583
Fire!

27:26.667 --> 27:28.125
There must be something
we can do.

27:28.208 --> 27:31.208
How? We're dead.
We're not even here.

27:31.292 --> 27:33.083
Just our memories,
our thought patterns.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.750
But tha-that must be
worth something.

27:35.833 --> 27:38.833
What we are is not
a matter of flesh.

27:38.917 --> 27:40.833
It's a matter of will.

27:40.917 --> 27:42.208
We know their
backgrounds, right?

27:42.292 --> 27:44.667
We know what they're doing.
Why don't we just..

27:44.750 --> 27:46.167
(Daniel)
'Phase Two.'

27:46.250 --> 27:48.125
'Instituting
Franklin reprogram.'

27:48.208 --> 27:51.000
'Placing Delenn module
in standby mode.'

27:52.125 --> 27:54.000
Proceeding with
next simulation.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.833
Doctor's personal log.
May Third, 2262.

27:58.917 --> 28:00.958
We have secured
several test subjects

28:01.042 --> 28:03.250
for the next series
of experiments.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.792
We will now continue with
the use of alien organs

28:05.875 --> 28:07.708
in human bodies
in an attempt to create

28:07.792 --> 28:09.208
a genetic crossbreed

28:09.292 --> 28:11.917
that will be compliant
to the needs of the Alliance.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.292
Later today,
we will begin again

28:13.375 --> 28:15.208
with our experiments
on children.

28:15.292 --> 28:16.583
Now the problem
with the vivisection

28:16.667 --> 28:18.500
is that the younger children
can only survive

28:18.583 --> 28:21.250
the initial removal of organs
for a short period of time.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.542
Now we hope that,
by increased use of drugs

28:24.625 --> 28:26.542
we may find a way
to prolong their lives

28:26.625 --> 28:28.667
while we work.

28:31.958 --> 28:33.792
(Daniel)
'Very good. Very good.'

28:33.875 --> 28:37.208
Program hold while I make notes
on this for infospeak division.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.708
So, Daniel, right?

28:41.792 --> 28:43.708
Dan. Danny.
Can I call you Danny?

28:43.792 --> 28:44.833
Oh, right.
Sorry, I forgot.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.250
I'm just a hologram

28:46.333 --> 28:48.042
and you're busy getting
ready to reprogram me.

28:48.125 --> 28:49.500
Didn't mean to interrupt.

28:49.583 --> 28:50.917
No point in having
a conversation

28:51.000 --> 28:52.250
with someone that
doesn't really exist.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.583
You know, I was just thinkin'.

28:53.667 --> 28:54.875
When you've got all
your pieces in place

28:54.958 --> 28:56.292
you're probably gonna launch

28:56.375 --> 28:57.750
a preemptive strike
against the enemy, right?

28:57.833 --> 29:00.625
I mean, it's what
I would do.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.875
Computer, initiate
shutdown of Garibaldi--

29:02.958 --> 29:04.083
Oh, whoa, whoa,
now, wait, wait, wait.

29:04.167 --> 29:05.333
Just one second.

29:05.417 --> 29:06.750
Before you do that

29:06.833 --> 29:09.167
I might have some useful
information for you.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.833
See, the thing is,
me and Sheridan were close.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.167
But I was the one who did

29:13.250 --> 29:15.208
most of the strategic
planning during the war.

29:15.292 --> 29:16.875
Now a resource like that..

29:16.958 --> 29:19.208
...you might not wanna wipe
it out just yet.

29:19.292 --> 29:20.792
I could help you.

29:20.875 --> 29:22.667
Give you some tips
to pass along to the big boys

29:22.750 --> 29:25.708
and maybe...get you
a promotion.

29:30.583 --> 29:31.708
Go on.

29:31.792 --> 29:33.250
Ah, well, before I can help

29:33.333 --> 29:35.292
I have to ask just
a few small questions.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.875
Now you're a real fact
kind of guy.

29:37.958 --> 29:40.125
You know what they're up to
out there, don't you?

29:40.208 --> 29:44.625
Come on, you can tell me.
Am I right?

29:44.708 --> 29:46.375
Ah, your boys are plannin'
a first strike

29:46.458 --> 29:48.250
against the enemy,
aren't they?

29:48.333 --> 29:49.750
That's why you're
rushing ahead like this

29:49.833 --> 29:51.125
because you're under the gun.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.792
We will strike at
the outer world colonies

29:55.875 --> 29:58.875
and the enemy nations here
on Earth at the same time.

29:58.958 --> 30:01.000
Our attack fleet will be
leaving within the hour.

30:01.083 --> 30:02.208
Good.

30:02.292 --> 30:04.042
Good, that's very smart.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.750
Now, will you be targeting
military bases

30:05.833 --> 30:08.042
or civilian population
centers?

30:08.125 --> 30:10.542
Civilian population
centers.

30:10.625 --> 30:15.167
We...my superiors feel
it will demoralize the enemy.

30:15.250 --> 30:16.750
force a surrender.

30:16.833 --> 30:18.375
Hmm. Estimated dead?

30:18.458 --> 30:21.958
Mm. 15 to 20 million
enemy casualties.

30:22.042 --> 30:23.958
Can't make an omelet without
breaking a few eggs, hmm?

30:24.042 --> 30:26.792
[laughs]
Absolutely.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.458
Now..

30:28.542 --> 30:31.375
...what...suggestions
do you have?

30:32.792 --> 30:36.625
Well, I suggest that you put
your head between your legs

30:36.708 --> 30:39.375
and you kiss your ass
goodbye.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.375
Thank you.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.417
Computer!

30:45.500 --> 30:47.333
The funny thing about being
a holographic record

30:47.417 --> 30:48.875
is that you don't
really exist

30:48.958 --> 30:53.375
except in patterns of light,
shadow, information.

30:53.458 --> 30:55.583
And I happen to have a knack
for breaking system codes.

30:55.667 --> 30:58.083
So while you were downloading
the new world order into me

30:58.167 --> 31:00.083
I was watching
the system work.

31:00.167 --> 31:03.333
I know where it comes in
and I know where it goes out.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.917
And I just sent out
our entire conversation.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.583
Broadcast the whole damn thing.

31:07.667 --> 31:10.125
So, as of right now,
the enemy knows

31:10.208 --> 31:11.792
what you have in mind,
Danny.

31:11.875 --> 31:13.042
Now, from your records,
they're actually

31:13.125 --> 31:14.583
a lot more humanitarian
than you are.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.458
So they'll probably
just target your military bases

31:16.542 --> 31:17.958
and research facilities.

31:18.042 --> 31:21.250
Hell, their missiles are
probably halfway here by now.

31:22.375 --> 31:23.792
You're lying.

31:23.875 --> 31:26.333
[alarm blaring]

31:26.417 --> 31:28.292
Hmm.

31:28.375 --> 31:31.250
Holograms don't lie,
Danny boy.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.917
Computer, end simulation.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.458
End simulation!

31:35.542 --> 31:37.292
Whoops, guess
the system's busy.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.667
This little lab of yours

31:38.750 --> 31:39.750
This isn't, by any chance

31:39.833 --> 31:43.250
located on a military base,
is it?

31:43.333 --> 31:45.000
No!

31:54.500 --> 31:56.292
Rest easy, friends.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.667
Rest easy.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.625
[explosion]

32:02.708 --> 32:03.792
(automated message)
'Record ends.'

32:03.875 --> 32:05.667
'Auto play feature engaged.'

32:05.750 --> 32:07.000
'Loading next sequence.'

32:07.083 --> 32:09.750
'Date 1,000 years
from first time period.'

32:09.833 --> 32:11.125
'Stand by.'

32:14.083 --> 32:15.208
'Accessing record

32:15.292 --> 32:16.917
'from initial scanning date.'

32:17.000 --> 32:18.167
'Stand by.'

32:18.250 --> 32:20.667
Ooh. Huh!

32:20.750 --> 32:23.667
Surprised it all still
works after this long.

32:23.750 --> 32:26.250
Well, better get
to my report.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.875
Start auto track systems.

32:28.958 --> 32:29.917
[knock on door]

32:30.000 --> 32:31.708
Oh! Oh.
Oh. Oh.

32:33.375 --> 32:34.375
[knock on door]

32:34.458 --> 32:35.667
Yes! I..

32:35.750 --> 32:36.667
[panting]

32:36.750 --> 32:39.542
Yes, yes, just a moment.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.375
Well, Brother Michael,
it's, it's rather late.

32:44.458 --> 32:45.750
Y-Yes, I-I know, I know.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.292
But, uh, I, I really had to talk
to you, Brother Alwyn.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.542
Um, um,
so it would seem.

32:50.625 --> 32:52.708
(Michael)
'I am having a, uh..'

32:52.792 --> 32:53.875
'...a crisis of faith.'

32:53.958 --> 32:55.042
That again?

32:55.125 --> 32:56.958
- 'What?'
- N-nothing. Nothing.

32:57.042 --> 32:59.000
And, uh, what is afflicting
your conscience

32:59.083 --> 33:00.375
tonight, Brother Michael?

33:00.458 --> 33:01.542
Well, I don't know
what my role is

33:01.625 --> 33:03.208
or what I'm doing here.

33:03.292 --> 33:04.458
You're doing God's work.

33:04.542 --> 33:05.708
Yes, but to what end?

33:05.792 --> 33:07.458
Well, the ways of the Lord
are mysterious

33:07.542 --> 33:10.333
and do not bend to your
or to my desire

33:10.417 --> 33:13.208
for answers
on a certain schedule.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.042
"Where was thou when I
called forth Leviathan?"

33:16.125 --> 33:18.208
Yes, I've read Job,
Brother Alwyn.

33:18.292 --> 33:20.167
And it is really not helping.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.917
Alright, Brother Michael.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.292
[sighs]

33:24.375 --> 33:28.250
What has precipitated
this particular crisis of faith?

33:28.333 --> 33:30.042
Well, there is a rumor
going round

33:30.125 --> 33:32.750
that our request
for recognition

33:32.833 --> 33:35.208
has been turned down
yet again by Rome.

33:35.292 --> 33:37.375
Yes, I see. Hmm..

33:37.458 --> 33:41.958
A better rationale for the vow
of silence I've never heard.

33:42.042 --> 33:44.333
Is it true?

33:44.417 --> 33:48.667
The ways of Rome
are like unto God.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.458
They are mysterious

33:50.542 --> 33:53.833
and sometimes
they transcend understanding.

33:53.917 --> 33:55.625
They confess to an inability

33:55.708 --> 33:57.500
to see the wisdom
of our mission.

33:57.583 --> 34:00.417
(Alwyn)
'To keep alive
the knowledge of the past.'

34:00.500 --> 34:02.500
'The knowledge that would
have been lost forever'

34:02.583 --> 34:04.792
'after the Great Burn
500 years ago.'

34:06.042 --> 34:08.000
Science and technology?

34:08.083 --> 34:13.125
Well, it's not really
their calling...but it is ours.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.625
But, I mean, well, how?

34:14.708 --> 34:17.083
I mean, h-how do we know
it's our calling?

34:17.167 --> 34:18.833
How exactly can we be sure?

34:18.917 --> 34:20.708
Uh, Brother Michael!

34:20.792 --> 34:22.042
I-I'm not actually
saying anything

34:22.125 --> 34:23.417
that Rome hasn't already asked.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.708
And you know it.

34:25.792 --> 34:27.917
Most of the records
were destroyed in the Great Burn

34:28.000 --> 34:30.250
so we only have word
of mouth to go on.

34:30.333 --> 34:35.375
In the holy books
written after the Great Burn!

34:35.458 --> 34:39.167
"And so it came to pass that in
the 500th year of the Alliance

34:39.250 --> 34:43.208
"the children of Earth
did war one upon another.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.375
"With missiles
and terrible weapons

34:45.458 --> 34:49.625
"and they burned the Earth
and the air and the cities

34:49.708 --> 34:51.083
and the sea!"

34:51.167 --> 34:55.542
You need only look outside
to, to have that part verified.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.583
Why is the rest suspect?

34:57.667 --> 34:59.208
It's all too, too clean.

34:59.292 --> 35:02.833
It's all too
well thought out to be real.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.333
Here. Here, here.

35:06.667 --> 35:10.625
The blessed Lorien,
the last of the firstborn.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.042
Exactly, the last
shall come first

35:13.125 --> 35:15.208
the first shall come last.

35:15.292 --> 35:18.000
A fable, specifically
created to match scripture.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.458
That's what the others say.

35:19.542 --> 35:21.583
And th-there's not
one shred of evidence

35:21.667 --> 35:22.833
that he even existed.

35:22.917 --> 35:26.208
Oh, there is proof
out there. In space.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.917
But space is closed
to us now.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.167
Just look at us,
Brother Alwyn.

35:34.292 --> 35:36.958
And look at what Earth
has become.

35:37.042 --> 35:39.958
Our cities are little
more than villages.

35:40.042 --> 35:41.083
All those great secrets

35:41.167 --> 35:43.042
of our ancestors
are almost gone.

35:43.125 --> 35:45.375
Almost. That's why
we're here.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.125
To find the ancient wisdoms
and preserve them.

35:48.208 --> 35:51.708
Why, we've already found
and restored so many books!

35:51.792 --> 35:54.667
Yes but we are not
one inch closer to..

35:54.750 --> 35:56.917
...to those flying machines
that the books talk about.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.042
Or to the stars.

35:59.125 --> 36:01.833
And, and if the truth really
does lie in the stars

36:01.917 --> 36:04.875
then how will we
ever know the truth?

36:04.958 --> 36:06.708
Look at the others.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.708
The blessed Sheridan.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.083
Who lived and died..

36:11.167 --> 36:12.750
...and returned from the dead

36:12.833 --> 36:14.958
and was taken bodily
into heaven.

36:15.042 --> 36:18.250
And Ivanova the strong,
Delenn, the wise..

36:18.333 --> 36:20.375
They could all be fables
for all we know.

36:21.875 --> 36:22.917
And the worst of it.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.500
What?

36:26.042 --> 36:28.750
I was halfway through
illuminating it when..

36:28.833 --> 36:30.375
...my heart just left me.

36:32.500 --> 36:37.375
The prophecies, the prophecies
of Delenn, the third

36:37.458 --> 36:40.750
said that the Anla Shak,
the Rangers

36:40.833 --> 36:42.750
would come again
to the Earth

36:42.833 --> 36:48.042
in her greatest hour
of need and rebuild

36:48.125 --> 36:51.167
what was once the cradle
of Sheridan and the Alliance.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.125
And we have waited
so, so long, Brother Alwyn

36:56.208 --> 36:58.792
and they have never come.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.458
If that's a myth, then..

37:00.542 --> 37:02.667
...then everything else
could be a myth.

37:04.167 --> 37:07.458
And the whole of my life
could just be a lie.

37:08.875 --> 37:13.125
And if they do not come today
but they come tomorrow

37:13.208 --> 37:15.250
is your life a lie then?

37:16.958 --> 37:19.625
I cannot help you,
Brother Michael.

37:19.708 --> 37:22.292
That is what faith is for.

37:22.375 --> 37:25.333
Faith sustains us in the hour

37:25.417 --> 37:29.208
when reason tells us
that we cannot continue.

37:29.292 --> 37:33.417
That the whole of our lives
is without meaning.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.667
Then why were we born able
to reason if reason's useless?

37:36.750 --> 37:40.083
Not useless,
but it's also not enough.

37:40.167 --> 37:43.167
Faith and reason
are the shoes on your feet.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.667
You can travel further with both
than you can with just one.

37:46.750 --> 37:50.500
If you must have reason for
an answer, then consider this.

37:50.583 --> 37:53.542
If today the Rangers
came back to Earth

37:53.625 --> 37:56.667
from their place in the heavens,
you would not know about it.

37:56.750 --> 38:00.000
They would come in secret
and move around and help us.

38:00.083 --> 38:02.333
And we wouldn't even know
they were here

38:02.417 --> 38:07.042
because the secret that
they bring is feared by people

38:07.125 --> 38:11.667
who still blame science
for the Great Burn.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.792
Then you think
the Rangers are here today?

38:14.875 --> 38:16.167
Well..

38:16.250 --> 38:19.375
I believe they could be.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.875
That's all that faith requires.

38:21.958 --> 38:26.208
That we surrender ourselves
to the possibility of hope.

38:26.292 --> 38:29.375
With that, I am content.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.750
And I believe
you will be as well.

38:36.625 --> 38:39.292
It's beautiful work.

38:39.375 --> 38:43.833
Too lovely and significant
for you to half finish.

38:43.917 --> 38:45.917
Finish your illumination,
Brother Michael.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.333
You've gone this far.

38:47.417 --> 38:49.083
It's too late to lose
your faith now.

38:49.167 --> 38:51.792
Or my faith in you.

38:51.875 --> 38:55.125
If the, uh, truth really
is in the stars, Brother Alwyn

38:55.208 --> 38:58.042
then just once,
once before I die

38:58.125 --> 39:01.167
I really wish that I could walk
amongst those stars.

39:01.250 --> 39:04.417
Uh, If there is a way,
Brother Michael

39:04.500 --> 39:07.458
I pray that your wish
comes true.

39:13.625 --> 39:14.750
Oh.

39:14.833 --> 39:16.125
Oh, dear.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.917
Your energy level's
almost down to nothing!

39:21.000 --> 39:24.333
I'm going to have to sit you
in the sun tomorrow to recharge.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.083
Alwyn Macomber reporting in.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.500
Nothing of substance
to report since my last.

39:31.583 --> 39:35.333
Uh, we think we may have
gathered enough information

39:35.417 --> 39:37.083
from the time pre Burn

39:37.167 --> 39:40.625
to assemble a working
gasoline engine.

39:40.708 --> 39:43.458
Obviously, there's no gasoline
in this part of the country.

39:43.542 --> 39:45.458
Therefore, we ask
the supply department

39:45.542 --> 39:47.875
if they could, uh, arrange

39:47.958 --> 39:49.667
to have a suitable
supply of gasoline

39:49.750 --> 39:53.417
found in the vicinity
near the abbey in a few days.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.292
Only this time,
for Valen's sake

39:56.375 --> 39:59.375
please make it look like
an old container.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.500
The last one could've been
produced a 100 years ago.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.208
We will rebuild the Earth.

40:16.292 --> 40:21.000
Mmm. Though it take us
another 2,000 years.

40:21.083 --> 40:24.333
But this time,
we will build it better.

40:26.667 --> 40:30.833
I'm attaching a conversation
I just had with Brother Michael

40:30.917 --> 40:33.625
who I still think
would be a worthy recruit

40:33.708 --> 40:35.000
after he's grown a little.

40:35.083 --> 40:38.083
Give him another 20 years
and he'll be fine.

40:40.458 --> 40:44.875
Alwyn, Anla Shak,
Earth sector. End report.

40:44.958 --> 40:48.125
We live for the one,
we die for the one.

Tell the others not to worry.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.542
I wouldn't miss this
for anything.

41:27.625 --> 41:28.875
Now go on.

41:35.250 --> 41:37.625
This is how the world ends.

41:37.708 --> 41:41.208
Swallowed in fire
but not in darkness.

41:41.292 --> 41:42.833
You will live on.

41:42.917 --> 41:46.250
The voice of all our ancestors,
the voice of our fathers

41:46.333 --> 41:49.083
and our mothers
to the last generation.

41:49.167 --> 41:52.250
We created the world we think
you would've wished for us.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.458
And now we leave the cradle
for the last time.

42:16.792 --> 42:18.708
[explosion]

42:30.208 --> 42:32.500
You should sleep.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.542
We both have early meetings.

42:35.708 --> 42:37.333
Yeah, I know.

42:39.125 --> 42:41.292
I was just thinkin'
about it all.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.000
Everything we've done..

42:44.458 --> 42:46.750
...and what I said earlier.

42:46.833 --> 42:50.458
And I was wondering
if they will remember us

42:50.542 --> 42:53.542
a hundred years from now
or a thousand.

42:55.833 --> 42:58.958
And I figure probably not.

42:59.042 --> 43:00.917
But it doesn't matter.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.542
We did what we did
because it was right.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.708
Not to be remembered.

43:05.792 --> 43:09.250
And history will
attend to itself.

43:09.333 --> 43:10.542
It always does.
