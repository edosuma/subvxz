00:06.680 --> 00:09.270

- Yep. It means bad poetry.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.440
I know what it means.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.080
You just turned my doginto doggerel.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.970
And it's what,13 points?

00:14.010 --> 00:15.320
Nope,26.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.490
Double word score.

00:16.530 --> 00:18.020
I am forfeiting this game.

00:18.090 --> 00:20.010
Oh,come on,robert. You can't forfeit.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.480
Sure I can.I've gotfive I's and an O.

00:23.730 --> 00:25.290
Besides,you look too beautiful.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.640
Focus. You have to focus.

00:29.370 --> 00:31.580
I didn't comeall the way up
herejust to play board games.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.160
You're not trying.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.720
now come on.You said you had an O.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.670
Do you--do you
havean--an r?

00:39.740 --> 00:40.960
You could spell rumor.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.240
okay,let me see your letters.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.490
- Oh,look at that. You have a T.
- So?

00:47.560 --> 00:49.030
So you can spell tumor.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.510
I don't want youstaring
at the word tumor.

00:53.550 --> 00:57.760
Robert... do you thinkthat I
have forgottenthat I have cancer?

01:00.600 --> 01:03.100
I had kevin rescheduletomorrow's
press conference

01:03.100 --> 01:05.019
in case the chemotakes
longer than they say.

01:05.069 --> 01:08.340
Oh,no,no,no.You don't--you don't have
to do that,because,uh,I'm gonna be fine.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.060
No,it's your first
time.I should be there.

01:10.630 --> 01:14.620
No,sorry. I've already decidedthat
you are not gonna bemy chemo buddy.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.310
W-w-well,who

01:16.340 --> 01:19.730
I dot know.I have a wholegaggle of
family membersjust waiting in line.

01:19.770 --> 01:23.240
But you,my friend,you are gonna
be concentratingon the campaign.

01:24.410 --> 01:25.960
What has happened to you?

01:26.030 --> 01:27.570
I mean,you didn't
evenwant me in this race,

01:27.600 --> 01:30.300
- and now I want to be therefor you...
- you're gonna be there for me.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.360
You're running for governor.
You're not going to the moon.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.700
And besides,the last thing I
needis you quitting on my account.

01:39.740 --> 01:40.970
Okay.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.570

01:57.570 --> 01:58.810
I'm,uh,justin.

01:58.850 --> 01:59.880
Justin walker.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.760
I'm sorry.Office
hoursdon't start until 1:00.

02:02.020 --> 02:03.820
You know what?This
willonly take a second.

02:04.970 --> 02:07.070
I've been reading upon the
cancer researchyou've been doing,

02:07.100 --> 02:11.610
and I know it's a bit late,but I was
wonderingif I could possiblyjoin your team?

02:11.810 --> 02:13.480
My assistant positionswere
filled a month ago.

02:13.510 --> 02:16.010
I know.And I know this
wouldbe making an exception.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.590
Well,even if I could,my grant funding
only allowsa certain number of students.

02:19.630 --> 02:21.450
Okay,you know what?I'd,uh,I'd volunteer.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.490
I'd,uh,I'd work for free.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.600
- Uh,what year are you?
- First.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.380
You know,in my experience,it's
better not to rushinto specializing.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.070
You might want to takea year or two,

02:30.070 --> 02:31.310
make sure oncology'swhat
you really want to do.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.020
No,its.

02:33.090 --> 02:34.310
Look,I'll,uh,I'll do anything.

02:34.350 --> 02:35.550
I'll,uh,empty your trash.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.610
I'll sweep the floors.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.280
I can,uh,offer you a penthat works.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.750
Here you go.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.010
What was your name again?

02:43.040 --> 02:44.610
Justin walker.

02:44.970 --> 02:46.300
I'll think about it,justin.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.370
Thank you.Thank you.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.120
Um,I won't disappoint you.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.450
- sorry I'm late.
- Where are we?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.130
- We?
- Yeah.

03:04.170 --> 03:06.680
- You mean me.
- Okay.That's all right.We'll catch up.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.650
I was trying tgetan
internship with dr.Condon.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.380
But you barely got thisunder control.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.800
- Look,I can handle this.
- Look,I told you.

03:12.830 --> 03:13.990
I'm not gonna get dragged down

03:13.990 --> 03:15.610
but your unfocused,naiveapproach
to medical school.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.220
Look,I told youI can handle this.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.640
All right,carter?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.720
- Unbelievable.
- Carter.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.190
I know this is probablynot
what you'rein the mood for,

03:30.260 --> 03:33.580
but,uh,rebecca and I are
gonnalook at wedding venues today.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.530
I would so love to,but I can't today.

03:35.570 --> 03:38.870
It's,um,kitty'sfirst chemo
treatment,and I have to be there.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.230
She hates hospitals,and
she hates needles,

03:41.230 --> 03:43.770
and it's--it's gonna
bea very rough day.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.820
- She needs me.
- Of course.

03:45.890 --> 03:46.960
Besides that,I really don't want to

03:46.960 --> 03:48.910
intrude on your mother-daughter time.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.450
Please,we're going to
bein-laws soon enough.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.970
We would loveto have you with us.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.910
Thank you,holly.I
really appreciate that.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.040
Okay,bye.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.640
Holly,you wanted to see me.

03:57.710 --> 03:58.740
uh,yeah.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.250
I nt you to follow upa
line on a jue broker.

04:03.190 --> 04:06.230
I think I have finally
locateda supply of cheap wine

04:06.230 --> 04:07.970
that we can useto make our blend.

04:07.970 --> 04:11.550
I would do this myself,but
I have promised rebecca

04:11.550 --> 04:13.510
that we would lookat
wedding venues today.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.310
Okay,but don't you thinkwe should
waituntil sarahgets back to work?

04:16.350 --> 04:18.440
I mean,she needs to weigh
inon the possibility of

04:18.440 --> 04:20.350
a low-budgetor a second line plan.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.959
And who knows?She might
havefound something in france.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.750
Well,we needthe revenue now.

04:24.020 --> 04:27.390
We need to put this deal
intomotion with the broker today.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.190
Okay,well,how do you knowpeople
are gonna buythis $2.99 swill,holly?

04:30.260 --> 04:33.990
In this economy,people will
buy itif we market it correctly.

04:34.020 --> 04:37.130
And if you give thema lottery
ticketto distract themfrom the taste.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.520
You know what,saul?

04:38.590 --> 04:40.210
Forget that I even asked.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.570
If that's the way you want
toleave it,that's fine with me.

04:41.610 --> 04:45.540
No,what I want isto
generate new revenue now.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.410
We have no idea how long it's gonna be

04:47.410 --> 04:50.040
before people are willing to
buy high-end products again.

04:50.070 --> 04:52.990
And quite frankly,we
can't afford to wait.

05:02.150 --> 05:04.900
- What,are we having company?
- no.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.760
No.I just want to be prepared.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.240
We don't know how you'll
feelafter this first treatment.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.680
So I made all your favores.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.060
I made tapioca pudding.

05:12.090 --> 05:15.560
I made fresh banana bread,lots
of p--no,no,don't,don'T.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.650
Don't--don't
drink that.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.860
You don't want any of that.No,no,nolook,I
made youa protein drink,

05:19.890 --> 05:23.330
because they say you shouldn'tgo
there on an empty stomach.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.690
Yes,so I madeoua great protein drink.

05:25.730 --> 05:28.530
And it has almond milkand
protein powder and--

05:28.560 --> 05:30.150
It's thick.

05:32.690 --> 05:36.130
- A little thick.
- Well,let me justthin it out for you.

05:36.210 --> 05:40.850
And then I'll put itin a travel
mug,because we can take itwith us.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.080
And I am all ready to go.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.890
Oh,mom. Oh,god,mom. I'm so sorry.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.680
I totally forgot
to tell youthat--

05:51.680 --> 05:55.110
that sarahis actually going
tocome here and pick me up,

05:55.110 --> 05:58.800
and--and she's gonna bemy
chemo buddy for today.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.140
Oh,great. Good.

06:02.170 --> 06:05.420
I mean,I,you know,I've hardly seen
hersince she got backfrom france,

06:05.490 --> 06:09.150
and I thoughtthat it would bea
nice opportunityfor us to catch up.

06:09.300 --> 06:14.130
So,you know,it doesn't
allhave to fall on you,okay?

06:14.160 --> 06:17.610
I mean,look at--look at allyou've done
so far,and it's only 10:00in the morning.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.170
I mean,I thinkyou should take the day.

06:20.500 --> 06:25.400
Take the dayand just enjoy
yourself,because guess what.

06:25.590 --> 06:28.470
- What?
- I am gonna be fine.

06:28.770 --> 06:30.470
Yes,yes.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.570
I know that. I know that.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.860
Yeah.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.170
Absolutely.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.770
The truth is,kitty and ispent a great
deal of timeweighing this decision,

06:42.040 --> 06:46.120
and the choice was clear--we could
suspend our campaignand let the cancer win,

06:46.420 --> 06:50.120
or we could continue to liveour own
livesand stand upfor what we believe in.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.290
And so that's why I'm
staying in the race,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.990
because kitty and I believe
that's what's best for our family

06:55.340 --> 06:57.150
as well as the stateof california.

06:57.590 --> 06:59.460
Okay,I'll take a few questionsnow.

06:59.530 --> 07:01.780
Uh,one at a time. steve.

07:01.850 --> 07:06.100
- Senator,I think I spefor everyonein wishing kitty well.
- Thank you.

07:06.140 --> 07:08.450
But to focus on your
decisionto keep campaigning--

07:08.490 --> 07:12.440
do you risk losing donorswho may
fearyou might drop outdown the road?

07:13.020 --> 07:17.250
Well,uh,I thinkthat my donors
appreciatethat I'm steadfastin my decisions.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.440
So,no,I-I don't thinkthat's
gonna be an issue.

07:19.510 --> 07:20.840
yes,lynda.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.070
If mrs.Mccallisterdoes support
your decisionto stay in the race,

07:24.070 --> 07:25.300
why isn't she here today?

07:25.300 --> 07:26.920
She's at home recuperating.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.760
Of course,but,senator,are you concerned

07:28.760 --> 07:30.680
that continuingyour gubernatorial run

07:30.680 --> 07:33.620
in the face of your
wife'sconditions will appear callous?

07:34.250 --> 07:37.650
Well,I think most calanorniswould
appreciatethat this isa private,family matter,

07:37.690 --> 07:40.100
and I think that
they'lljudge it as such.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.490
Next question.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.730
now,kitty,you may feela little
coldas it reaches your vein.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.080
Okay.

07:52.150 --> 07:53.600
Here,let's warm you up.Come on.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.650
Get you nice and warm.

07:56.570 --> 08:00.850
Sarah... can you,uh,can you talk please?

08:01.120 --> 08:02.300
What do you want meto talk about?

08:02.350 --> 08:03.450
I don't know.I don't know.Anything.

08:03.530 --> 08:04.960
You can talk aboutyour trip.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.850
Okay.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.230
there it is.

08:11.570 --> 08:12.870
it's okay.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.670
You're okay.

08:17.850 --> 08:20.850
So...we were running late,

08:20.850 --> 08:22.690
sat on the tarmacfor,like,two hours.

08:22.690 --> 08:24.460
I don't know how the
airlinesget away with that.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.630
We circled parisfor
at least an hour--

08:26.700 --> 08:30.590
sarah,tell me a good story.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.590
I don't want to have
to firemy chemo buddy.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.090
I met a guy.

08:38.539 --> 08:39.669
You did?

08:40.010 --> 08:41.169
- Really?
- Really.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.419
Well,you didn't--you
didn't tell me that.

08:42.450 --> 08:44.000
Well,I'm telling you now.

08:44.940 --> 08:47.560
Oh,my god. Okay.

08:48.190 --> 08:51.400
Okay,I want youto tell me every
detail,and don't skimp on anything.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.100
Okay.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.260
I was running late.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.200
I'd been driving all morning.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.630
I was lost looking

09:03.330 --> 09:07.340
Driving throughthese beautiful
fieldspeppered with sunflowers.

09:08.290 --> 09:13.550
And there was this little farmlet,I
guess... beautiful,big,old barn.

11:45.020 --> 11:46.410

beshivering a little bit.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.260
- Is that normal?

11:48.290 --> 11:51.950

12:24.650 --> 12:25.930
I asked her.

12:26.130 --> 12:28.100
I thought kittywas getting a treatment.

12:28.130 --> 12:31.610
Well,yes,she did.We were halfway
out the door,and sarah showed up.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.510
They haven't had any time to
betogether since sarah got back.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.420
And then I got to comehelp you here.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.860

12:44.570 --> 12:47.840
Look at--this isan
impressive place.

12:47.870 --> 12:49.490
Jean harlow once lived here.

12:49.530 --> 12:51.190
Did she live here?

12:51.680 --> 12:53.680
- oh,that must be sarah.
- Oh,no,no,it's mine.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.770
I'm sorry,rebecca.This
will just be one minute.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.280
Yeah,what is it?

12:57.880 --> 13:00.250
Yeah,I-I just needthe
price of the juice.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.710
Fine,fine. Put me throughto the broker.

13:03.140 --> 13:06.880
Uh,now most of our couples doa
cocktail hour right out here.

13:06.910 --> 13:10.080
- We fill the poolwith floating candles.
- it's beautiful.

13:10.530 --> 13:12.080
I mean,what do you ink,nora?

13:12.420 --> 13:15.270
Well,I-I think--I thinkyou
have to,you know,feel it.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.250
Feel what?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.840
Well,feel that it's right.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.180
Feel that it's likeyou and justin.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.820
well,I mean,justin likes water.

13:24.860 --> 13:26.300
Uh,I'm so sorry.

13:26.340 --> 13:27.870
So where were we?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.350
Uh,why don't we go upstairs?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.520
We have a fantastic
areafor the brid suite.

13:31.590 --> 13:33.310
Are they shooting a movie?

13:33.870 --> 13:35.250
Are you shootinga movie here?

13:35.510 --> 13:39.080
Uh,yes. Well,you know,we rent the
space outfor a variety of events.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.980
I thought they'd be done by now.

13:41.270 --> 13:42.750
Must be a priodiece.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.240
I-I think it is.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.570
whAt period?

13:47.920 --> 13:49.240
olden times.

13:49.470 --> 13:50.730
Yes.I can't keep up.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.670
but why don't we go
lookat the bridal suite?

13:52.710 --> 13:54.020
Shall we?

13:54.630 --> 13:55.640
I'm sorry.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.220
are they shooting porn?

14:01.210 --> 14:02.280
Really?

14:02.400 --> 14:03.480
Here,now?

14:03.550 --> 14:06.990
Well,now--now we don'trent out the
space for filmingon the weekends.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.700
And I would be happyto
throw in free valet.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.630
Free valet.

14:11.970 --> 14:13.380
oh,no.I don't think so,no.

14:13.410 --> 14:14.650
Go,go.

14:14.650 --> 14:15.710
We can get to the
streetthis way,can't we?

14:15.740 --> 14:17.380
go right downthese stairs.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.090
This wasn't supposed to happen.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.590
we need to discussthe kitty issue.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.140
Ternal polls are showinga drop.

14:29.180 --> 14:31.250
First of all,can we pleasenot refer

14:31.250 --> 14:33.320
to my wife's illnessas the kitty issue?

14:33.600 --> 14:34.670
Okay,sorry.

14:34.740 --> 14:38.280
but if we don'tget kitty out thereand
show the publicshe's behind you,

14:38.320 --> 14:39.490
this is just gonna get worse.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.430
No,it'll be worse if we do.

14:41.510 --> 14:42.760
They'll think we're using her.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.560
It's a risk,I agree,but
we can't do nothing.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.380
Look,kevin--a-and jotthis
down if you have to,

14:46.420 --> 14:47.680
because I'm--I'm
notgonna say it again--

14:47.790 --> 14:50.170
kitty's well-beinghas nothing
to do withthe state of california

14:50.240 --> 14:52.750
or myintegrity or my job performance.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.490
- Why can't we say that?
- We did say that.

14:54.530 --> 14:55.730
We--we said
that explicitly.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.770
Yeah,and they didn't hear you.

14:56.810 --> 14:57.970
You know why?

14:57.970 --> 14:59.600
It came from the wrong mouth.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.130
A statement at the least.

15:03.210 --> 15:05.850
- No,I'm not gonna use her.
- I willhelp her draft it myself.

15:05.890 --> 15:08.130
No,do
not--kevin,back o--

15:08.130 --> 15:10.060
there is too much in playfor
you to see this clearly.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.110
Leave kitty alone.

15:11.150 --> 15:12.650
She and ihave made a decision.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.560
And that should be good
enoughfor everybody!

15:14.950 --> 15:16.500
Including you.

15:26.240 --> 15:31.100
Spend the most importantday of your
lifein the opulentastin ballroom.

15:31.700 --> 15:36.440
Details include fine linenswith
buttercup or eggshell,

15:36.440 --> 15:39.940
silver,gold or
blackchiavari chairs--

15:39.940 --> 15:41.180
what's chiavari?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.370
Well,it's that.That's a chiavari chair.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.010
Okay,wait. W-what else is in
this--this love in the afternoonpackage?

15:47.040 --> 15:50.660
A love in the after--it
includesa chocolate fountain.

15:54.830 --> 15:58.050
yeah,the idea of the walkersin the
same roomwith five tiers of hot,

15:58.080 --> 16:00.630
moltenchocolate is pretty rrifying.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.470
all of these packages--they're
like--the'yre like...

16:03.670 --> 16:06.360
a slightly different versionof
the same generic wedding.

16:06.410 --> 16:09.830
Oh,well,maybe your momhas some
ideashow to personalize it.

16:09.860 --> 16:12.330
Yeah,if she would everget off the phone.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.080
sweetie,you know what? If you don't
like this venue,then we should just go.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.110
There are plenty of othersto look at.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.720
Yeah,maybe we should.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.340
so what do you think?

16:23.380 --> 16:24.860
Does this place have potential?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.270
- Uh,no.We're moving on.
- We just got here.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.340
Well,maybe it seems that waybecause
you've been onhe phonethe entire time,

16:30.410 --> 16:32.890
but--rebecca,I was onlyon
the phone for five minutes.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.210
Look,why don't wenot make any
decisionuntil we tour the grounds?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.500
Why,so we can just sign a
checkand get the search over with?

16:39.530 --> 16:41.620
I mean,I know that this isan
inconvenience for you,clearly,but--

16:41.660 --> 16:43.960
- you know,I-I don't think
that...- that's not what I'm saying.

16:44.030 --> 16:46.060
I'm saying how can you
makean informed decision

16:46.060 --> 16:47.940
withoutchecking out the entire venue.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.080
Because I've seen enoughto
know that it's not right.

16:50.150 --> 16:52.780
I mean,ask nora. You
eitherfeel it or you don'T.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.730
Okay,I-I thinkthere
is something to that.

16:56.980 --> 16:59.230
- But--but sti,you--but... - what,mom?
You've never done this before.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.890
Nora has,multiple times.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.339
I mean,kevin and scotty'swedding was
perfect,and it was--it was so them.

17:05.410 --> 17:07.010
I want that for justin and me.

17:07.050 --> 17:10.060
Oh,so what you're saying is that you
want to have your wedding at nora's?

17:10.060 --> 17:11.060
Well,she's sitting right here.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.650
- So why don't you just
ask her? - You know,that--

17:12.690 --> 17:14.490
If youwould just listen
for once,you would know

17:14.490 --> 17:16.020
that's notwhat I'm saying at all.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.530
- I'll tell themI'll call them right back.
- Take it.Take it.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.040
That's what you'd
ratherbe doing anyways.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.140
- Rebecca,please.
- Take the call.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.380
- I don't have to take it.
- Nora,I'm sorry we wasted yourtime.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.310
To think that we
couldactually do this together?

17:24.339 --> 17:26.160
- It's unbelievable.-
Rebecca,don't be this--

17:35.960 --> 17:37.130
careful.

17:37.310 --> 17:38.430
You'll severthe radial artery.

17:38.470 --> 17:39.470
Hey,can you back up?

17:39.510 --> 17:41.830
It's pretty hard to focus
whenyou're breathing down my neck.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.530
Not bad.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.890
- Uh,thanks.
- Thank you.

17:46.930 --> 17:49.570
Justin,can you come byand see
me tomorrowduring office hours?

17:49.900 --> 17:51.060
Uh,yeah.

17:51.450 --> 17:53.230
Everything... all right?

17:53.570 --> 17:54.980
Just want to discussa few things.

17:55.690 --> 17:57.110
Yeah,yeah,I'll be there.

17:57.180 --> 17:58.550
Great.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.010
this is aboutlast week's quiz.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.200
Damn it.

18:05.230 --> 18:07.830
I thought I nailed it.We studied
that for,like,six straight hours.

18:09.030 --> 18:10.560
god,why does hewant to talk to me?

18:12.250 --> 18:14.250
I told him I wantedto
switch lab partners.

18:15.370 --> 18:16.770
- What?
- Sorry,nothing personal.

18:16.810 --> 18:18.940
But I just need
someonewho's 100% committed.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.540
Wait a second.You told
madsenI wasn't committed?

18:20.570 --> 18:21.990
You show up late.

18:22.030 --> 18:23.710
Yeah,and you freaked
outwhen you saw a cadaver.

18:23.740 --> 18:24.900
I didn't go running to madsen.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.490
That was once,this is a pattern.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.300
You know what?Screw you.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.860
Back up,carter.

18:36.970 --> 18:38.140
here we go.

18:38.220 --> 18:41.780
P.Mini marshmallows,oven-fried
chicken,mac and cheese and pudding.

18:42.430 --> 18:43.960
God,how do I get your diet?

18:46.040 --> 18:47.830
Oh,sorry.That was insensitive.

18:47.900 --> 18:48.990
It's okay.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.950
I-I guess mom is
tryingto spark my appetite

18:51.950 --> 18:54.670
by bringing out all my
oldchildhood favorites.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.540
but... oh,no way.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.770
I'm not hungry.

18:58.810 --> 19:00.130
I don't care.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.630
You are going to eat.

19:03.750 --> 19:04.950
All right,I'll eat...

19:05.450 --> 19:08.000
If you tell me moreabout mr.Frenchy.

19:08.870 --> 19:10.320
It's a deal.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.980
You never made it to that
wineryyou were looking for,did you?

19:13.020 --> 19:14.430
Not that week,no.

19:14.460 --> 19:15.640
Week?

19:16.620 --> 19:17.880
It was amazing.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.900
stop blocking your face.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.100
you're making meself-conscious.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.030
Your face,it is powerful
and soft...like you.

19:56.030 --> 19:59.770
What do you know about me,except
for my inabilityto read a map?

19:59.770 --> 20:02.050
Your expressions--it
tells me many things.

20:02.050 --> 20:06.290
For example...your brow,your jaw...

20:07.330 --> 20:09.500
sarah,you're a womanwho's in control.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.030
You like control.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.220
Your eyes and your smile...

20:17.240 --> 20:19.010
they say something different.

20:19.230 --> 20:22.770
You want to be wild,give
in to your impulses.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.260
Did they teach you thatat art school?

20:25.260 --> 20:28.980
No. It's something I simply see.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.950
What elsedo you simply see?

20:34.340 --> 20:36.150
That you're slow to trust.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.600
Maybe a little.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.890
But you want to let go.

21:08.640 --> 21:09.650
Hello.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.610
Hello. Should I come back?

21:14.610 --> 21:16.670
- Yeah,yeah.
- No,no,yeah. No,no,no.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.250
- Uh,you'll stay,I'll go.
- No,no,no.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.490
- We'll,uh,continue this tomorrow.
- Oh,tomorrow?

21:20.980 --> 21:23.250
- Keep her hydrated,will you?
- Yeah,yeah. Thanks.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.430
No problem. I'll call you tomorrow.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.060
when I'm better,we're going to france.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.850
Wherever you want.

21:32.340 --> 21:34.620
- How's evan? - Oh,his--his
cold'sgetting better.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.690
The doctor says he's almostwell
enough to be around you.

21:37.690 --> 21:41.390
Oh,good,good. 'Cause
I-I really miss him.

21:41.390 --> 21:45.390
Tommy. he sent a very nice note.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.630
So how was it?

21:48.630 --> 21:53.410
Uh,it wasn't,uh...it wasn't as
scaryas I thought it would be.

21:53.410 --> 21:56.090
And I--I'm
definitelynauseated,though.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.820
Here.

22:02.970 --> 22:05.690
- At's that?
- Acupressure.

22:05.690 --> 22:08.650
If I put pressureright on
your palm,it reduces nausea.

22:08.650 --> 22:11.620
How come I never knew
aboutthis skill before?

22:11.620 --> 22:14.420
'Cause I justlooked it up online.

22:16.130 --> 22:19.010
I'm just... happy to be
ableto do something to help.

22:19.010 --> 22:22.530
Are you gonna make me
askabout the press conference?

22:24.560 --> 22:25.650
It went fine.

22:25.650 --> 22:27.080
- Fine?
- Yeah.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.660
That's it?

22:28.660 --> 22:30.480
But you--but you
alwaystell me everything,

22:30.480 --> 22:32.290
right down to the distractingsheen

22:32.290 --> 22:34.820
on the loafersof ted from the times.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.960
Usylly,mwifeisn't just
finishingher first round of chemo.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.520
What were the numbers? I bet you're
down with women. What--what are they?

22:42.900 --> 22:44.450
We took a hit.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.930
- But I'm not worried.
- You always worry. That's why you win.

22:47.930 --> 22:49.530
All right,well,this time,I'm gonna win

22:49.530 --> 22:51.170
and I'm not gonna
worry. How's that sound?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.060
- Like a lie.
- Come here.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.610
Just leave...california out there.

23:01.650 --> 23:04.490
In here,it's just you and me.

23:12.030 --> 23:13.620
Hey.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.910
- Uh-oh. -
Uh-oh,what?

23:18.910 --> 23:20.380
You're folding socks.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.890
You only fold sockswhen you're upset.

23:23.280 --> 23:27.410
well,we don't havea wedding
venueand my mother and ifought today.

23:27.410 --> 23:31.210
- Oh,well,that sucks.
- Yeah. How was your day?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.780
Remember that
oncologyinternship I applied for?

23:33.780 --> 23:35.150
Oh,no. You didn't get it?

23:35.150 --> 23:37.130
Oh,that's up in the
air,but check this out.

23:37.130 --> 23:41.250
So carter decides to tellprofessor
madsenthat he wantsa new lab partner.

23:41.250 --> 23:44.020
- What?
- Yeah. He says I can't handlethe workload that I already got.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.960
Doogie thinks you can'thack it?

23:47.110 --> 23:48.760
What a tool.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.140
all right,so what's going
onwith the venue things?

23:54.750 --> 23:57.930
I mean,I had no ideathat
wedding stuffis so cookie cutter.

23:57.930 --> 24:01.570
- It's just not us.
- All right. So what wouldmake it personal?

24:01.570 --> 24:05.220
Becca,I surewhen you were a little girl,you
know,you had plansabout your wedding.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.750
Kitty and sarah used
toplay bride all the time.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.350
So did kevin.

24:10.420 --> 24:12.400
well,I didn'T. I mean--I-I
mean,it's not like

24:12.400 --> 24:14.730
I had some wedding album of my
mother's to look through,you know?

24:14.730 --> 24:18.220
I... I think you havea defective bride.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.770
Rebecca,I don't havea
defective bride... at all.

24:20.770 --> 24:22.040
Well,I don't know. I don't know.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.900
I... I think maybeyou
should plan the weing.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.620
yeah. Well,unless you
wantchili dogs and chicken wings

24:27.620 --> 24:29.620
at a dodger game,that's
probably a bad idea.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.270
how's kitty?

24:38.880 --> 24:40.330
She's asleep.

24:40.330 --> 24:41.650
Great.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.210
God,she's tough.

24:47.010 --> 24:48.890
according to sarah,they had fun today.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.250
Good.

24:50.430 --> 24:52.180
I'm glad sarah's back.

24:52.780 --> 24:54.360
Kitty needs you guys.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.660
How are you holding up?

24:56.660 --> 24:58.070
Good.

25:00.110 --> 25:03.750
So I assume you don't wantan update
on the polls,which are still down.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.460
Correct assumption.

25:05.940 --> 25:08.730
Uh,well,let's see,in otherimportant
state matters--oh,yeah,

25:08.730 --> 25:11.140
madera countywould like your support

25:11.140 --> 25:13.210
in their campaignto
change the state bird.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.230
How about the ostrich? They're so cute.

25:15.230 --> 25:17.870
You know,they do that
wholehead-burying-in-the-sand thing.

25:17.870 --> 25:19.360
I'm not burying my headin the sand.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.240
Yes,you are. Come on,robert.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.670
You march into that officeand
act like you're working.

25:23.670 --> 25:25.990
- We all know what's going
on-- - what do you want from me?

25:25.990 --> 25:29.880
- You do realize,kitty will notlet you quit this campaign?
- I haven't quit.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.400
No,you've stopped running,because
you knowif you do nothing,

25:32.400 --> 25:34.630
your whole campaignwill
fall apart on its own,

25:34.630 --> 25:36.880
and you can tell
kittyyou tried your best.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.740
Reality is,you're sabotagingyour
chances,and you know it.

25:39.740 --> 25:42.040
Kevin,stay out of it.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.720
hey,how are you feeling?

25:56.720 --> 25:59.720
Oh,I feel likeI want to vomit,and
the deep breaths are notcutting it,

25:59.720 --> 26:02.030
so please,you need to tell me the end.

26:02.030 --> 26:04.230
It was a vacation romance.

26:04.230 --> 26:09.300
And... like vacations...it ended.

26:09.300 --> 26:12.270
Oh,I know. But just
tell me--tell me how.

26:14.900 --> 26:18.740
- Sarah? Are you there?
- Yeah.

26:20.610 --> 26:26.370
you know...he... he
wasn'twho I thought he was.

26:26.370 --> 26:30.730
The last day I was
there,I went for a walk.

27:05.470 --> 27:07.360
- sarah-- -
who was at?

27:07.360 --> 27:09.870
- I must explain.
- Don't bother.

27:09.870 --> 27:11.310
I'm so sorry.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.160
You wonderwhy I don't trust.

27:17.310 --> 27:19.260
No,no,no.
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.110
No,no,wait
a--wait a second.

27:21.110 --> 27:22.850
I know this.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.580
- You go back to your
car,and it doesn't start.

27:26.580 --> 27:30.750
and then you go backto t farmhousewith
the both of them. It's the movie.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.640
- What movie?

27:32.640 --> 27:33.960
This whole time,you've been telling me

27:33.960 --> 27:35.150
the plot of that french movie

27:35.150 --> 27:37.510
that mom used to lovewhen we were kids.

27:37.510 --> 27:40.050
Okay,you're right. You busted me.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.310
I'm sorry.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.170
You mad at me?

27:44.170 --> 27:45.950
No,I'm not mad.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.870
I'M... you took my
mindoff of everything.

27:49.870 --> 27:52.560
I'm--I'm just very
sadthat you didn't get to

27:52.560 --> 27:55.470
havea love affair
with a hunky frenchman.

27:55.470 --> 27:59.060
Yeah... me,too.

28:07.170 --> 28:10.760
Hey,where'd you go? I thought
you were next to methe whole time?

28:11.450 --> 28:14.760
Oh. You're not robert.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.310
He's at the drug
storefilling a prescription.

28:17.310 --> 28:19.590
But I can sit with youif you
want. That's why I'm here.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.500
Are you allowed to have that?

28:24.710 --> 28:26.000
that blog waright.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.490
Chemo definitely makesthe
beer taste better.

28:28.490 --> 28:31.740
- Could I?
- Get your own. I have cancer.

28:34.890 --> 28:38.490
So,um...robert's been
gettingreally beat up

28:38.490 --> 28:41.190
for not suspendinghis campaign,right?

28:41.830 --> 28:43.160
He told you?

28:44.350 --> 28:46.370
Nope. He didn't have to.

28:48.330 --> 28:50.650
- how bad is it?
- You know what? I wouldn't say that bad.

28:50.650 --> 28:52.120
Well,that's becausehe won't let you.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.010
But what's the plan?
What's the counterstrategy?

28:56.760 --> 28:59.050
Oh,great. You don't have one.

28:59.050 --> 29:02.330
You know what? I'm kinda caught
here betweena rock and his wife,

29:02.330 --> 29:04.490
- so can we just-- - oh,you
know what? Come on,kevin.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.240
He's not doing anything.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.570
It's--it's like the
rope-a-dope with no plan of

29:10.570 --> 29:12.600
coming off the ropesand
actually throwingany punches.

29:12.670 --> 29:14.470
All right. So what are we gonna do?

29:15.720 --> 29:18.820
Let him suspend--a
clean,dignified break.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.650
Why let him limpthrough a campaignhe
doesn't even wantto be a part?

29:21.650 --> 29:23.740
All he wants is to be herewith you.

29:23.740 --> 29:26.010
Well,too bad. He can'T.

29:26.010 --> 29:30.240
Why not? You know,you keep asking
usto keep on living normally.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.980
Well,you know what? People put
things on holdwhen people are sick.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.010
- No,no,no,we're not gonnaput anything on hold...
- yes,they do. Take care of yourwife.

29:35.010 --> 29:37.200
- That's acting normally!
- Because if he quits,and idon't survive this,then what?

29:37.200 --> 29:39.320
Don't--please do
notgo there,okay?

29:39.320 --> 29:42.210
Well,I have to go there,kevin.
I don't have a choice.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.650
Now you are either in
denialof who robert is or

29:44.650 --> 29:47.470
you'rein denial of how
thingsmay turn out for me,okay?

29:47.470 --> 29:50.580
If he quits,and I die,then what?

29:51.770 --> 29:52.910
Anwe're notgonna let that happen.

29:52.910 --> 29:55.180
And you are nnahelp
me,kevin,because robert needs this,

29:55.180 --> 29:57.470
- especially if-- -
please,one condition.

29:57.470 --> 29:58.880
- What? -
No more if-G.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.760
You're getting better. That's that.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.150
Okay,fine. I'm getting better.

30:06.270 --> 30:08.080
so how do we help him?

30:08.630 --> 30:10.890
I think I have an idea.

30:14.540 --> 30:18.080
Look,sir,I-I know that goingfor an
internship right nowmay not bethe best idea,

30:18.080 --> 30:21.420
but--has someone in your
familybeen diagnosed with cancer?

30:22.100 --> 30:25.500
Yeah. Um...my sister kitty.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.010
It's lymphoma,stage iii.

30:27.010 --> 30:29.530
- How did--how did you know that---
because I've seen this before--

30:30.050 --> 30:34.000
a-a sudden academic fire,newfound
interest in oncology.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.390
I'm sorry.

30:35.390 --> 30:37.900
I--you know,I-I--that's--I'm--I
just wantto help somehow.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.120
And there's nothing wrongwith that,

30:39.120 --> 30:41.710
and many of the
greatestadvances in medicine,

30:41.710 --> 30:44.890
in every branch of science,has been made

30:44.890 --> 30:47.630
by people who havevery personal motives.

30:47.630 --> 30:50.260
Then--then why is goingfor
an internship a bad idea?

30:50.260 --> 30:51.900
Justin,because there isa right way

30:51.900 --> 30:54.140
and a wrong wayto go about things.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.700
Taking on so muchin your first year,

30:55.700 --> 30:57.730
and then,god forbid,you fail?

30:58.350 --> 31:00.310
How does that help anybody?

31:02.200 --> 31:05.110
Yeah,you're--you're
right. I-I-I get it.

31:05.600 --> 31:09.880
And now...about carter.

31:10.290 --> 31:12.800
carter,yeah. He,uh,he
wants a new lab partner.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.270
Well,he is brilliant.

31:14.270 --> 31:15.410
So he tells me.

31:15.410 --> 31:18.310
But he's so afraid of failurethat
he can't think straight.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.530
Yeah,well,me,too.

31:19.530 --> 31:22.160
But you have more
practicallife experience

31:22.160 --> 31:24.630
than any student I've hadin years.

31:24.630 --> 31:28.010
And he's had less lifethan
anyone I've ever met.

31:28.010 --> 31:30.370
So what,you--you want
meto get him laid or--

31:30.370 --> 31:33.460
no,mr.Walker. I want you
to teach himby example

31:33.460 --> 31:36.370
how to get along with
peoplein the real world.

31:38.140 --> 31:40.310
Yeah,I...yeah,I
c--I can do that.

31:40.310 --> 31:46.140
Good. And look,someday you may
becomean extraordinary oncologist,

31:46.140 --> 31:47.990
able to help peoplelike your sister.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.210
But every journey
startswith the first step.

31:50.210 --> 31:54.350
And in this case,the
first step is the hand.

31:57.690 --> 31:59.960
Start with the hand.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.630
I left my cell phonein the car.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.550
I'm surprised that
youwanted to meet me here.

32:14.550 --> 32:18.600
- No,I-I asked you becauseI
wanted your opinion. - Yeah.

32:18.600 --> 32:22.030
But,uh,I also really needto
apologize. I'm--I'm sorry.

32:22.030 --> 32:24.540
I-I was frustrated,and
I took it out on you,

32:24.540 --> 32:26.360
and I shouldn't have.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.900
I promise I won't beall bridezilla

32:28.900 --> 32:30.460
for the rest ofthe wedding planning.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.030
you weren't that bad.

32:32.030 --> 32:33.820
And I'm sureit was really annoying,

32:33.820 --> 32:35.660
me picking up the phoneall the time.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.440
No,no. Is everything okay?

thinkabout your wedding,

33:08.060 --> 33:10.340

33:11.820 --> 33:13.860
I don't have a picture.

33:13.860 --> 33:15.500
I mean,where was iwhen
all of these little girls

33:15.500 --> 33:18.000

weddingsin their bedrooms?

33:18.000 --> 33:21.510
Outside in the

33:25.540 --> 33:28.430
You would stay outas
long as I would let you.

33:28.430 --> 33:33.990
You and that stuffed dolphinthat I got

How are you feeling?

34:01.630 --> 34:04.720

34:29.730 --> 34:31.469

34:31.469 --> 34:33.370
Mom,you're already doing it.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.760
I feel likeI'm not doing enough.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.989
Well,you can't cure me.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.489
I wish I could pull
every bitof that cancer

34:41.489 --> 34:43.760
out of youand put it in me instead.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.179
I wish it were me.

34:46.179 --> 34:48.900
I know. That's why I couldn'thave
you with me yesterday.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.889
I didn't want to put youthrough that,

34:50.889 --> 34:53.900
and--and besides,if
you cry,I cry.

34:55.630 --> 34:56.969

34:59.000 --> 35:01.370

35:07.500 --> 35:11.000
I don't know. Dr.Avadonsaid they're
gonna maybeput in a chest catheter.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.910
It makes it easier.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.240
I don't want to cry.

35:22.310 --> 35:24.760
it's okay.

35:25.990 --> 35:28.590

35:42.980 --> 35:45.610
Are you at a good placeto take a break?

35:45.610 --> 35:50.080

Okay,um,so you knowhow you said that,

36:13.960 --> 36:15.330

36:15.330 --> 36:16.540
Well,I-I didn'T.

36:16.540 --> 36:19.110
But I did playthe isle of awoka-woka.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.230
I would go outsidewith
my littlestuffed animal--

36:22.230 --> 36:23.550
bradmore--this
little dolphin,

36:23.550 --> 36:25.740
and we'd great strand...Bradmore?
On a deserted island.

36:25.740 --> 36:28.270
But instead of--instead
ofbeing sad,we would be happy,

36:28.270 --> 36:29.440
because,you know,there werepalm trees

36:29.440 --> 36:31.720
and tiki torchesand--and
coconut desserts,

36:31.720 --> 36:32.970
and it was just--it
was perfect.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.360
And it was everythingthat I ever want

36:34.360 --> 36:36.790
edon this--this
little island.

36:39.270 --> 36:42.190
Please tell me this
meansa wedding in hawaii.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.360
- Oh,I love that.
- Yeah?

36:44.360 --> 36:46.770
- I love that.
- Yeah? I mean,you can surf.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.980
Uh-oh. Maybe a little bitof this?

36:48.980 --> 36:50.290
- Yeah.
- A little of that.

36:50.290 --> 36:52.700
- A little hula dancing.
- Yeah.

36:53.730 --> 36:55.570
- A little bit of this.
- look at your spinalis!

36:56.980 --> 36:58.820
What do you say to peoplethat think

36:58.820 --> 37:01.900
that robert should suspendhis campaign?

37:01.900 --> 37:03.990
Well,I would say thatthat would be

37:03.990 --> 37:07.390
a real tragedyfor the
people of california.

37:07.390 --> 37:11.100
California needsrobert mccallister.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.190
And he will be there for us.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.960
He'll be there for all of us.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.970
You know,robert needs
tocontinue to fight his battle

37:17.970 --> 37:22.140
just like I need to
continue to fight mine.

37:22.140 --> 37:25.800
and I don't think you'll find either
one of uscowering in the corner.

37:25.800 --> 37:30.540
- what is this?
- Your polls going up. Her idea.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.990
I also truly believethat robert has

37:32.990 --> 37:36.590
this uncanny ability to stay focused...

37:36.590 --> 37:40.230
even when he needs to
make hard judgments.

37:40.230 --> 37:43.910
You seem well,kitty,and I mean
you soundincredibly positivein

37:43.910 --> 37:46.410
light of thisdifficult situation.

37:46.410 --> 37:48.440
How do you achieve that?

37:48.870 --> 37:51.180
With a lot of help.

37:51.180 --> 37:55.550
I am surrounded by--by
so much love and support.

37:55.550 --> 38:00.230
Ever since my diagnosis,my
husband,my mother,my siblings--

38:00.230 --> 38:05.320
everybody has really...
really rallied around me.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.260
hey,mom. It's so funny you called.

38:48.260 --> 38:50.130
I was just in thisgorgeous patisserie.

38:50.130 --> 38:52.480
They had those little pastriesyou love.

38:56.150 --> 38:57.450

38:59.820 --> 39:01.360
Oh,my...

39:04.650 --> 39:07.160

39:07.160 --> 39:09.910
Sarah. What's wrong?

39:09.910 --> 39:12.620

39:13.670 --> 39:15.130
I've gotta go. I'm sorry.

39:15.130 --> 39:16.570
Sah.

39:16.570 --> 39:19.310

with us today,kitty.

39:19.310 --> 39:22.130
Well,thank you. It's my pleasure.

39:22.130 --> 39:25.730
that was pundit and
blogger kitty mccallister,

39:25.730 --> 39:29.370
the wife of senator robert
mccallister,talking...

39:29.850 --> 39:31.710
I thought we hadan arrangement.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.110
Which one was that?

39:33.110 --> 39:37.000
That you we gonna concentrateon getting
welland leave the campaigningto me.

39:37.950 --> 39:40.320
Right,right. But you weren't
holding upyour end of the bargain.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.930
It's not healthy for you.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.640
You need to ignore it.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.760
Well,then you need
toallow me to ignore it.

39:47.370 --> 39:49.350
Stop throwing the game.

39:49.350 --> 39:52.270
That's your--your
plan,right?

39:53.010 --> 39:55.240
I'd still be a senator.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.140
I just wouldn't be min
theiddle of this campaign.

39:58.140 --> 39:59.530
No,I know what this is about.

39:59.530 --> 40:04.700
This is about us. This is
about--this about us... before.

40:06.690 --> 40:09.150
What if I'm notthat guy anymore?

40:09.620 --> 40:12.590
What if I don't want itat any cost?

40:13.560 --> 40:17.300
Because I know that you arethe
most important thing to me.

40:18.620 --> 40:19.920
And I didn't know that before.

40:19.920 --> 40:26.390
And I...I'm ashamed of that.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.300
Honey...you don't owe me anything.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.280
Yes,I do.

40:36.180 --> 40:39.870
Well,then you can't
stopbeing an example.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.760
What do you mean?

40:41.760 --> 40:44.180
You never give up.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.960

40:49.430 --> 40:51.320
