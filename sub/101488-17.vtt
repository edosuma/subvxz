WEBVTT

00:22.272 --> 00:24.232
Hey, bud, careful. The janitor just waxed.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.651
Remember, if the floor is shiny,
you can fall on your heinie.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.820
-Thanks, Tina.
<i>-TINA: Yeah, that's me,</i>

00:28.903 --> 00:30.947
<i>Tina Belcher, ordinary eighth grader.</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:32.741
<i>That's probably what makes me</i>
<i>good at my job.</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:34.826
<i>I walk the beat as</i>
<i>a hall monitor here at Wagstaff,</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:36.703
<i>but I was about to discover</i>

00:36.786 --> 00:38.288
<i>that sometimes you walk the beat,</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:40.040
<i>and sometimes the beat walks you.</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:45.128
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.088
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>I bet you're wondering who she is,</i>

00:47.172 --> 00:49.716
<i>and how a girl like me got</i>
<i>mixed up with a dame like that.</i>

00:49.799 --> 00:51.718
<i>Her name is Holly Monitors,</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:53.928
<i>and she was supposed</i>
<i>to be my little secret.</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:55.388
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

00:55.472 --> 00:57.307
<i>Let me tell you how this all began.</i>

00:57.390 --> 00:58.808
<i>It was just like any other day.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:01.102
<i>Like I said, I'm a hall monitor,</i>

01:01.186 --> 01:03.063
<i>but it's not the halls</i>
<i>that need monitoring,</i>

01:03.146 --> 01:04.356
<i>it's the people in them.</i>

01:04.439 --> 01:06.024
<i>Someone's always chewing gum.</i>

01:06.107 --> 01:08.985
Oh, man, there's still
some flavor in there. Come on.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.862
<i>TINA: I may seem like</i>
<i>a party pooper, but it's better</i>

01:10.945 --> 01:12.989
<i>if I'm pooping at their party</i>
<i>than a teacher.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:16.034
<i>Teachers give out</i> detention,
<i>I give out</i> attention.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.869
A new piece, for the end of the day.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.997
-Ooh, cinnamon. Fancy.
-Now scram.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.249
<i>And sometimes it's hard to be</i>
<i>on the good side of the law</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:24.459
<i>with the two scamps in my family.</i>

01:24.542 --> 01:25.877
<i>They were always up to something.</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:27.003
<i>But I lived with them,</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:28.588
<i>so I had to live with myself.</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:30.340
<i>Still, something was different that week.</i>

01:30.423 --> 01:32.759
<i>I had a feeling I hadn't felt</i>
<i>since the fidget spinner craze.</i>

01:32.842 --> 01:34.511
<i>Or that other craze</i>
<i>where everyone was eating</i>

01:34.594 --> 01:36.513
<i>those spicy dusty chips and throwing up.</i>

01:36.596 --> 01:38.098
Hey, hey, no running.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.558
Stop running, slow down.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.936
-Huh.
<i>-Whatever it was, I was sure it would go</i>

01:43.019 --> 01:44.312
<i>as quickly as it came.</i>

01:44.396 --> 01:45.522
<i>Besides, I had other things to focus on.</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:46.940
<i>Big things.</i>

01:47.023 --> 01:48.608
<i>Like the big banner the hall monitors</i>

01:48.692 --> 01:50.944
<i>were working on for the open house.</i>

01:51.027 --> 01:52.278
<i>Sure, being a hall monitor</i>
<i>is not as exciting</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:54.239
<i>as the drama club or dance club</i>

01:54.322 --> 01:56.950
<i>-or jazz choir...</i>
-♪ <i>Do-bee, do-bee, do-wah.</i> ♪

01:57.033 --> 01:58.702
<i>...but it's my life.</i>
<i>This open house would be</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:00.620
<i>the hall monitors' biggest day yet,</i>

02:00.704 --> 02:02.914
<i>working security as parents</i>
<i>and the superintendent</i>

02:02.997 --> 02:04.332
<i>came to experience a...</i>

02:04.416 --> 02:05.667
Full day of Wag.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.294
Not some phony two-hour evening event.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.504
I'm talking about a full day,

02:09.587 --> 02:12.257
living and breathing the real deal.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.884
You will be helping to welcome
all of the parents

02:14.968 --> 02:17.262
and the superintendent to the upcoming

02:17.345 --> 02:20.473
"Walk on into Wagstaff" open house.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.766
From the opening assembly...

02:21.850 --> 02:23.685
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>He needed it to go perfectly,</i>

02:23.768 --> 02:25.270
<i>because if it did, the superintendent</i>

02:25.353 --> 02:26.730
<i>would pay for Frond to go to...</i>

02:26.813 --> 02:30.400
Counsel Your Butt Off,
a weekend seminar in Sarasota

02:30.483 --> 02:33.361
for life changers and emotion rearrangers.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.947
So, this week, I'm counting on you

02:36.031 --> 02:38.867
to stop the hooligans
before they hool again.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.202
Now get out there and monitor.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.955
Tina, can I, uh, talk to you for a moment?

02:44.039 --> 02:47.125
-Sure, what's up?
-Uh, not here. My office.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.711
There's a favor I need to ask you, Tina.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.796
You're my most experienced hall monitor.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.965
You're good at what you do.
You have a light touch.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.800
-The kids seem to like you.
-Thank you.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.344
-I mean, in their way.
-Oh.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.054
The thing is, I have a feeling

02:59.137 --> 03:01.431
that there's something going on.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.892
Kids are distracted, whispery.
Test scores are down.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.935
Art supplies are missing.
Kids are hanging out

03:06.019 --> 03:08.605
in new groups: the populars
mixing with the regulars.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.024
Whatever it is, I need it to stop.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.901
I need to add it to the no-no list.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.611
The open house is in three days.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.780
I need the superintendent
to think this place runs

03:16.863 --> 03:18.573
like a well-oiled baby.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.034
I'm not sure if I'm using
that phrase correctly.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.286
-Sounds good to me, boss.
-But how can I stop

03:23.370 --> 03:25.622
whatever's going on
if I don't know what it is?

03:25.705 --> 03:27.624
That's where you come in.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.459
<i>TINA: I told him I could find out</i>
<i>what was happening.</i>

03:29.542 --> 03:31.378
<i>Of course I could.</i>
<i>But I was about to discover,</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:33.046
<i>no matter which way you turn,</i>

03:33.129 --> 03:34.631
<i>fate can stick out a foot and trip you.</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:36.549
-(shouts)
<i>-Or sometimes your own shoelace</i>

03:36.633 --> 03:38.718
<i>-can stick out a foot and trip you.</i>
-I'm okay.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.012
<i>When you're working a case,</i>
<i>you have to be subtle.</i>

03:41.096 --> 03:42.764
(high-pitched):
So, Gene and Louise,

03:42.847 --> 03:45.975
anything new going on
at school? Distracting you?

03:46.059 --> 03:49.104
Nope. Just learning a lot, as usual.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.313
Ooh. What'd you learn?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.107
Science. Also, math.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.025
And that thing with the letters.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.319
-Uh, spelling?
-No, thank you.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.822
<i>TINA: Either they really didn't know</i>
<i>or they didn't want me to know.</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:00.699
<i>Either way, it was a dead end.</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:02.200
<i>I was gonna have to put in</i>
<i>some shoe leather.</i>

04:02.283 --> 04:04.452
Fruit Roll-Up, huh? Nice.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.372
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Ooh, my old barrette.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.295
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!

04:14.379 --> 04:16.589
<i>I took a little break for a sloppy joe,</i>

04:16.673 --> 04:19.009
<i>and stumbled sideways</i>
<i>into a mess of my own.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:21.428
A popular and a regular?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.054
Where are you two going?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.862
-(crowd whooping)
-(gasps) Gene.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.196
What the hand?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.286
<i>TINA: From the moment I saw her,</i>
<i>I knew I was in trouble.</i>

04:46.369 --> 04:48.413
<i>Sure, I knew she was technically</i>
<i>my brother's hand,</i>

04:48.496 --> 04:51.916
<i>but when she walked down those</i>
<i>stairs, everything changed.</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:53.585
<i>She had a certain something.</i>

04:53.668 --> 04:55.337
<i>You might call it style,</i>
<i>you might call it chutzpah,</i>

04:55.420 --> 04:57.005
<i>you might call it fingers,</i>

04:57.088 --> 05:00.592
<i>but whatever you called it,</i>
<i>sister, it was calling me.</i>

05:00.675 --> 05:04.596
GENE:
Mm. Mm. Ah. Ah. Ah.

05:04.679 --> 05:08.350
-(cheering, applause)
-Give it up for Mavis Middlefinger!

05:08.433 --> 05:11.519
-Encore.
-Okay, okay, okay, you want more?

05:11.603 --> 05:13.063
You know what to do.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.482
Nickels, candy, gum that bubbles?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.859
Whatever you're thinking, make it double.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.528
All right, all right, we'll see
Mavis again, but first,

05:20.612 --> 05:23.865
coming to the stage,
Regular Sized Randolph.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.540
-Hey, Louise.
-Oh. Hey, Tina.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.543
What, uh, what are you, uh, doing here?

05:35.627 --> 05:36.795
Just checking out the scene.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.214
Oh, uh, no offense, but we kind of have

05:39.297 --> 05:41.216
a "no hall monitor" rule around here.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.511
Oh, uh, o-okay, uh, I'm not
a hall monitor right now.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.889
Just Tina. Belcher.
Your sister. And friend.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.265
(chuckles) Okay, are you sure?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.851
Because you are making a weird lying face.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.229
Oh, no. I-I just did a gross burp

05:54.312 --> 05:56.731
and I'm trying to hold in the smell.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.608
Oh. Okay, well, you can stay

05:58.692 --> 06:01.027
as long as you keep
your lips zipped, potato chip.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.612
Looks like I'm on.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.198
-Regular Sized Randolph, everyone.
-(cheering, applause)

06:05.281 --> 06:08.076
If you like Randy, give him some candy.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.245
Wow. Bunch of loose Nerds and a quarter?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.580
Oh, wait, no, it's a corn chip.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.790
Bring back Mavis!

06:13.873 --> 06:15.041
-Mavis.
-Yeah, Mavis.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.626
Okay, okay, cool down.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.920
We've still got nine minutes
of lunch period left.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.007
But for now, how about
a hand for these hands?

06:22.090 --> 06:26.594
It's Tom Shoes and his gorgeous
ex-wife Skatie Holmes.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.514
-(cheering, applause)
-Everybody, look at my hands.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.351
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>I guess you could say it. I was wrapped</i>

06:33.435 --> 06:34.728
<i>around those fingers.</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:36.062
Hey, guys. Hey, Gene.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.397
Great finger dancing today.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.065
(shushes) Tina, keep it down.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.275
Oh, sorry. Uh...

06:40.358 --> 06:41.484
(whispers):
Great finger dancing today.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.987
We call it handy prancing, but thanks.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.032
-So it's a secret?
-Of course it is, T.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.576
Because it's amazing and "distracting."

06:49.659 --> 06:51.077
Yeah, the first time I did it was at lunch

06:51.161 --> 06:52.912
when you were at a hall monitor meeting.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.330
I'd seen it on the Internet.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.415
And like everything
I've seen on the Internet,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.083
I tried it right away.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.210
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>He painted on a pair of mustard shorts</i>

06:59.294 --> 07:01.129
<i>and slipped on some Tater Tot shoes.</i>

07:01.212 --> 07:03.006
<i>Ms. Labonz yelled at him to cut it out,</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:05.592
<i>but, oh, it took off from there.</i>

07:11.222 --> 07:13.892
Soon, the scene got so big,
we had to take it underground

07:13.975 --> 07:16.186
so we wouldn't wind up
on Frond's no-no list.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.688
Gene's the best at it,
and it's making me--

07:18.772 --> 07:21.900
I mean, us--
three, four dollars a day easy,

07:21.983 --> 07:23.693
-plus candy and gum.
-Cool.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.695
-Mind if I come back tomorrow?
-Sure. I mean,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.947
you're not gonna go rat us out
to Frond, are you?

07:28.031 --> 07:30.909
What? No way.
I'll keep it Frond-fidential.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.494
Confidential. Ha, ha.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.912
Great. Um, see you then.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.538
And also for the rest
of the walk home now,

07:35.622 --> 07:37.499
and later tonight and tomorrow morning.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.459
Ah, you doing one of those
gross burps again?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.002
Yep, yep, yep.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.837
<i>Sure, I wasn't telling them</i>
<i>the whole truth,</i>

07:42.921 --> 07:45.423
<i>but I wasn't gonna tell Frond</i>
<i>the whole truth either.</i>

07:45.507 --> 07:47.509
<i>Maybe there was another way out.</i>

07:47.592 --> 07:49.177
<i>It was a complicated sandwich,</i>

07:49.260 --> 07:50.762
<i>and I was the salami in the middle.</i>

07:50.845 --> 07:52.555
Ooh! Tina. Easy with the broom.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.724
Oh, sorry, I was just thinking, I guess.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.519
<i>Inside, I was a deck of 52 cards</i>
<i>scattered on the floor,</i>

07:57.602 --> 08:00.188
<i>but from the outside I had</i>
<i>to look like a straight flush.</i>

08:00.271 --> 08:02.691
(chuckles):
Tina, you're sweeping me off my feet.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.151
-Literally.
-Ugh. Dumb broom.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.363
(panting):
Guys, I've got a huge problem.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.074
Okay. Is this like when you
couldn't get your underwear off?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.618
Because I'm not helping you again.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.412
You-you need to buy bigger underwear.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.580
No, this is worse. You know Kathleen?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.667
-Yeah. -Well, she invited me
to the movies in a couple of days.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.127
Aw, that's great, Teddy.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.628
Yeah, but here's the problem:
she could only

08:23.712 --> 08:26.089
get tickets at 5:30,
which is dinnertime.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.632
So I told her I could pick up
a couple of burgers

08:27.716 --> 08:29.592
from you guys, but the last time
I tried to sneak

08:29.676 --> 08:32.095
a burger into the movies,
it didn't go so well.

08:32.178 --> 08:36.016
Sir, you aren't allowed to bring
outside food into the theater.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.559
(shouting) Sorry! Sorry!

08:40.937 --> 08:43.440
-Oh, no.
-Wait, is that why you have

08:43.523 --> 08:45.483
a cardboard cutout
of Vin Diesel in your house?

08:45.567 --> 08:46.901
No, that was a gift.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.903
Ugh, I don't know what to do
about this food.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.780
I told Kathleen I would bring burgers.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.240
This could make or break us.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
Well, well, maybe we can
help you sneak 'em in.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.119
I can make you a little sneaky snacky.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.371
Oh, thank you, Linda. Thank you.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.290
You can't just waltz in there
with a bag in your hand.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.251
That's lesson one. You got to be
like <i>The James Bourne Identity.</i>

09:03.335 --> 09:05.420
You got to hide it. Give me a day, Teddy.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.339
-I'll come up with something.
-Oh, thank God.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.342
I was really panicking there.
(chuckles, sighs)

09:10.425 --> 09:13.094
Better have a burger and fries
and another burger to calm down.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.138
-Yep.
<i>-TINA: Life just kept moving around me,</i>

09:15.221 --> 09:16.598
<i>and I kept moving around life.</i>

09:16.681 --> 09:19.559
<i>Like walking and stuff,</i>
<i>but also sitting sometimes, too.</i>

09:19.642 --> 09:22.103
<i>So I guess moving and also not moving.</i>

09:22.187 --> 09:23.897
<i>Depending on what I was doing.</i>

09:23.980 --> 09:26.816
<i>Meanwhile, I couldn't stop</i>
<i>thinking about her.</i>

09:26.900 --> 09:28.485
<i>She was so free, so wild.</i>

09:28.568 --> 09:31.905
<i>I wondered what it felt like to</i>
<i>walk a mile in her tiny shoes.</i>

09:31.988 --> 09:34.240
<i>It'd probably take a while,</i>
<i>because her feet are so small,</i>

09:34.324 --> 09:37.118
<i>but boy, oh, boy, I had</i>
<i>a feeling it would be worth it.</i>

09:37.202 --> 09:39.245
-Ow. Tina.
-Sorry.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.539
So, have you found out what's up?

09:41.623 --> 09:43.416
On a scale of friendship
bracelets to teen pregnancy,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.877
-how bad is it?
-No info yet.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.087
But, you know, I've got some hunches

09:47.170 --> 09:48.963
and I'm eating some lunches.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.508
Okay.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.510
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>I thought I had it under control.</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:57.514
<i>But it turned out, what</i>
<i>I couldn't control was myself.</i>

10:27.043 --> 10:28.545
-LOUISE: Tina.
-(shouts) Nothing.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.797
-You were handy prancing.
-W-Was I?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.425
You, uh, want to get up on stage tomorrow?

10:33.508 --> 10:36.553
Oh, no, I don't think so.
This was just an accident.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.179
Sure. Your hand just accidentally fell

10:38.263 --> 10:40.056
into some of your old
Equestranaut clothes.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.225
(chuckles):
Yeah. You'd be, uh,

10:42.308 --> 10:43.977
surprised how often that happens.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.187
(chuckles): Okay, well,
Mom says come to dinner.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.023
Great, let's all get out
of my room quickly, then.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.649
GENE:
We'd better hurry. Looks like she's going

10:49.733 --> 10:51.776
for my spaghetti. Mom, trip her!

10:51.860 --> 10:53.611
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>What did it mean?</i>

10:53.695 --> 10:55.488
<i>I was supposed to be busting</i>
<i>those freewheeling fingers.</i>

10:55.572 --> 10:56.990
<i>But I wanted to be one?</i>

10:57.073 --> 10:58.074
<i>I was all mixed up like some kind of...</i>

10:58.158 --> 10:59.409
<i>mixed-up thing.</i>

10:59.492 --> 11:01.953
Okay, you must be wondering about these.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.913
They're my old armpit hairnets

11:03.997 --> 11:05.373
from when I had to wear armpit hairnets

11:05.457 --> 11:06.458
in the restaurant.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.876
I thought we bronzed those.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.711
They're for Teddy-- for his movie burgers.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.755
Linda, isn't that kind of gross?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.715
I mean, would you want to eat a burger

11:13.798 --> 11:15.175
that's been in somebody's armpit?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.135
Armpits are the cleanest part of the body.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.971
(chuckling): No, I-I, I really
don't think that's true.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.556
Uh, besides, won't the burgers

11:21.639 --> 11:23.266
get all soggy and mushy in there?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.435
I've eaten plenty of food
that's been in Mom's armpit.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.270
That's how she warms stuff up on the go.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.731
Bagels, baked potatoes, empanadas, soup.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.025
Yeah, I made s'mores in there one time.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.319
And what's your great idea,
Mr. Smarty-sneaks?

11:34.402 --> 11:38.823
Um, anything would be better
than food from your armpit.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.533
What about crotch, butt crack?

11:40.617 --> 11:41.910
Folded under one's boobs?

11:41.993 --> 11:43.161
Ooh, good idea.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.371
Tina, you're quiet.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.622
Uh, everything okay?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.540
Oh, sorry, um... delicious.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.417
-What?
-Dinner's delicious?

11:49.501 --> 11:50.669
Is that what we're talking about?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.087
Thank you, Tina.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.713
I'm not telling you how I heated it up

11:53.797 --> 11:55.382
because apparently <i>someone's</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:56.841
-worried about that.
-Mmm.

11:56.925 --> 11:57.884
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>I had it bad.</i>

11:57.967 --> 11:59.177
<i>And that wasn't good.</i>

11:59.260 --> 12:00.762
<i>Unless... it was?</i>

12:02.931 --> 12:04.724
Are you sure she's working for Frond?

12:04.808 --> 12:06.601
I mean, something's going on.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.812
That was her lying face,
not her burping face.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.439
But one thing's for sure,
she's in over her head.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.359
And if we keep her in,
she won't rat us out.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.944
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>Could I hear them? Yes.</i>

12:16.027 --> 12:17.362
<i>They were very loud whisperers.</i>

12:17.445 --> 12:18.613
<i>So they were on to me,</i>

12:18.697 --> 12:20.365
<i>and I was on to them being on to me.</i>

12:20.448 --> 12:22.367
<i>And luckily, Frond didn't suspect a thing.</i>

12:22.450 --> 12:24.202
-I suspect something.
-(shouts)

12:24.285 --> 12:26.037
I suspect you're not very good
at your job,

12:26.121 --> 12:27.414
because you haven't found squat.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.581
Back off, Frond! I'm working on it!

12:28.665 --> 12:29.874
Go counsel something.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.168
<i>Was I lying to him or lying to myself?</i>

12:32.252 --> 12:34.587
<i>Was I in too deep or not deep enough?</i>

12:34.671 --> 12:36.923
<i>Was I ready to change</i>
<i>or had I already changed?</i>

12:37.007 --> 12:39.300
<i>Who was I becoming</i>
<i>and was it becoming on me?</i>

12:39.384 --> 12:41.761
<i>Was I asking too many questions</i>
<i>or not enough?</i>

12:41.845 --> 12:44.264
<i>Or just the right amount?</i>
<i>All I wanted to do was the thing</i>

12:44.347 --> 12:46.266
<i>I was supposed to stop.</i>
<i>It was like my hand</i>

12:46.349 --> 12:47.600
<i>had a mind of its own.</i>

12:47.684 --> 12:49.477
And now, for the first time ever,

12:49.561 --> 12:51.229
give it up for... for...

12:51.312 --> 12:53.064
Uh, what-what was your name?

12:53.148 --> 12:55.525
Holly Monitors.
Because I'm a hall monitor.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.027
No, no, I get it, I get it.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.612
Give it up for Holly Monitors!

12:59.696 --> 13:01.865
-(cheering, applause)
-(shouts) I'm okay!

13:04.325 --> 13:05.535
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>It was a rush.</i>

13:05.618 --> 13:07.620
<i>The crowd was electric.</i>

13:07.704 --> 13:08.913
<i>The feeling... it was...</i>

13:08.997 --> 13:11.041
<i>I had never felt anything like it before.</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:12.500
<i>Absolute freedom.</i>

13:12.584 --> 13:14.669
<i>Holly knew what she wanted</i>
<i>and she went for it.</i>

13:14.753 --> 13:16.171
<i>So whose side was I on?</i>

13:16.254 --> 13:17.797
<i>Well, I was more turned around</i>

13:17.881 --> 13:19.466
<i>than that time Aunt Gayle</i>
<i>got caught in her curtains.</i>

13:19.549 --> 13:20.967
<i>But as long as I could keep struttin',</i>

13:21.051 --> 13:22.344
<i>that's all that mattered to me.</i>

13:22.427 --> 13:24.095
<i>So I did what Holly wanted.</i>

13:24.179 --> 13:26.264
<i>And Holls, she wanted it alls.</i>

13:26.348 --> 13:27.932
<i>I was living two lives.</i>

13:28.016 --> 13:29.351
<i>Busting kids in my vest.</i>

13:29.434 --> 13:31.644
<i>And busting moves in my dress.</i>

13:31.728 --> 13:33.730
<i>But it was getting harder and harder</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:34.981
<i>to keep it up.</i>

13:40.987 --> 13:42.697
<i>I was usually the one on the sidelines,</i>

13:42.781 --> 13:44.074
<i>watching the show.</i>

13:45.492 --> 13:46.743
-(Bob laughs)
-So good.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.661
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>But this time, I was in the show.</i>

13:48.745 --> 13:50.747
<i>And, honey, the show was in business.</i>

13:50.830 --> 13:52.749
<i>You know, show business?</i>

13:52.832 --> 13:55.251
<i>But nothing this complicated</i>
<i>can go on for long</i>

13:55.335 --> 13:57.253
<i>without someone getting hurt.</i>

13:57.337 --> 13:59.214
Hi, kids. How was school?

13:59.297 --> 14:00.757
Great. Everything is totally fine.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.717
And I'm not hiding anything from anyone.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.053
Okay...

14:05.136 --> 14:07.097
<i>TINA: I didn't want to worry Mom.</i>
<i>She was a good girl.</i>

14:07.180 --> 14:08.807
<i>She didn't need to get</i>
<i>mixed up in all this.</i>

14:08.890 --> 14:10.600
-Psst. Tina?
-Yeah? What?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.143
You were great today.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.937
Yeah, your hand only fell over twice.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.523
-And you only fell over three times.
-Thanks.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.316
So, Teddy, do you want
to use my pit holders

14:18.400 --> 14:20.318
to get the burgers
into the movies or what?

14:20.402 --> 14:22.320
-It's perfect, right?
-Um...

14:22.404 --> 14:24.280
-(groans)
-Don't worry, Teddy.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
You don't need to answer that.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.117
I figured out a better way

14:27.200 --> 14:28.451
for you to get the burgers in.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.245
-You did?
-Yep. All you need is

14:30.328 --> 14:31.996
eight plastic bags and a vest.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.667
You see? Each part of the burger
is contained in its own bag.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.294
Wow. That is elaborate, Bob. (chuckles)

14:38.378 --> 14:40.213
Okay, and so you just take each part out

14:40.296 --> 14:41.965
and build the burger fresh.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.426
No soggy buns. Now I just sit down,

14:44.509 --> 14:46.386
wait for the movie to begin,

14:46.469 --> 14:48.805
and make myself the perfect burger to eat.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.765
Oh, shoot. Hang on.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.976
-Bob, your tomato fell out.
-I can see that, Teddy.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.478
Still seems like a perfect plan,
though, Bobby. (chuckles)

14:55.562 --> 14:58.148
It'll work. Okay,
now I just take out each bag

14:58.231 --> 15:00.900
in order, starting with the bottom bun...

15:00.984 --> 15:02.527
-That's lettuce.
-Thank you, Teddy.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.154
Uh, hang on. Let me just fix this.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.031
You know what, maybe
we'll just get popcorn, right?

15:06.114 --> 15:08.199
We'll get an extra large
and we'll just split it.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.285
What? No! Take my pit holders, Teddy.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.287
No, no, take mine. I-I fixed it, look.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.539
-Oh, crap.
-I'm just gonna put the holders on you.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.750
-So you have 'em if you want.
-No, that's okay.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.543
Lin, I don't want the pit... things.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.378
-He wants this!
-No. Uh...

15:20.462 --> 15:21.463
Wait, w-where are you going?

15:21.546 --> 15:23.298
-Teddy, take 'em!
-Uh, I... I...

15:23.381 --> 15:24.841
-You're gonna love 'em, Teddy, come on!
-Take it, Teddy!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.718
-Teddy, come on! -BOB: Teddy, take this.
-Ah, you know

15:26.801 --> 15:28.470
I can't handle when two people talk to me!

15:28.553 --> 15:31.222
-(screaming)
-Huh.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.558
I can't believe he didn't
like either of those ideas.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.852
-I know.
-His loss.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.438
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>Anyway, life was good. Too good.</i>

15:38.521 --> 15:40.857
<i>It's like I always say,</i>
<i>when you're on top of the world,</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:43.109
<i>the only place left to go is down.</i>

15:43.193 --> 15:45.236
<i>Okay, I didn't always say that,</i>
<i>but I'm saying it now.</i>

15:45.320 --> 15:46.780
<i>And I plan on saying it again</i>

<i>because it's fun to say.</i>

15:48.239 --> 15:50.408
-Tina. My office, now.
-(shouts)

15:50.492 --> 15:52.327
I need something, Tina.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.829
The open house is so close,
and kids are still acting weird.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.998
I need more time! Give me a few weeks!

15:57.082 --> 15:59.459
-The open house is in two days.
-Okay, I didn't know that.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.878
What? You made the banner
that says the date on it.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.506
Wait a minute. Who are you protecting?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.675
Who got to you? Was it Lenny DeStefano?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.635
He got an eighth-grade girl
to keep his rabbit

16:08.718 --> 16:10.261
in her lunchbox for three weeks.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.055
I know he's very powerful.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.723
I'm not protecting anyone!

16:13.807 --> 16:15.433
I just haven't found anything yet!

16:15.517 --> 16:18.937
(sighs) Tina, I didn't want it
to come to this, but...

16:19.020 --> 16:20.980
I may have to take your vest.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.233
-What? No!
-I can tell you're lying.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.568
Your-your face looks absolutely bananas.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.570
Uh...

16:27.654 --> 16:28.947
<i>What choice did I have?</i>

16:29.030 --> 16:30.740
<i>I had to tell him something.</i>

-There you have her, folks!

16:36.371 --> 16:38.123
Fing-lise Belcher.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.083
This is very weird, Millie.
I don't like it.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.711
Because you <i>love</i> it?
Can we hold hands now?

16:42.794 --> 16:44.879
Louise! Louise, there's
something you need to know!

16:44.963 --> 16:46.297
Hey, what is it, T?

16:46.381 --> 16:48.133
-You looking for stage time?
-No, I...

16:48.216 --> 16:49.801
What in the world?!

16:49.884 --> 16:51.386
Tina! You didn't!

16:51.469 --> 16:52.971
No! I actually didn't. I mean,

16:53.054 --> 16:54.597
I came here to tell you
that he wanted me to,

16:54.681 --> 16:55.849
but I didn't tell him anything!

16:55.932 --> 16:57.017
Yeah, right.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.518
I knew I shouldn't have trusted a vest.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.937
I am a vest, but I'm also your sister.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.439
Not anymore you're not.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.690
All right, everyone.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.442
Pack up your adorable little accessories

17:05.525 --> 17:07.944
and get out of here! They're banned!

17:08.028 --> 17:10.363
This is all banned, effective immediately!

17:10.447 --> 17:12.449
Here's a finger, now get out of here.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.242
-That's your thumb.
-The thumb is a finger.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.827
No. This is a finger.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.120
Millie!

17:19.581 --> 17:21.916
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>And just like that, it was all gone.</i>

17:22.000 --> 17:24.044
<i>The fun, the friendships, the fingers.</i>

17:24.127 --> 17:25.837
<i>I had flown too close to the sun.</i>

17:25.920 --> 17:27.839
<i>In this case, my mom's son, uh,</i>

17:27.922 --> 17:29.674
<i>and also her daughter, who happened to be</i>

17:29.758 --> 17:31.051
<i>my brother and sister.</i>

17:31.134 --> 17:32.260
<i>And they didn't want</i>
<i>anything to do with me.</i>

17:32.344 --> 17:33.636
<i>Louise switched seats</i>

17:33.720 --> 17:35.430
<i>at dinner so our elbows wouldn't bump.</i>

17:35.513 --> 17:37.098
<i>Sure, Gene still invited me</i>

17:37.182 --> 17:38.850
<i>to serve him bubble bath chicken nuggets,</i>

17:38.933 --> 17:40.810
<i>but we didn't have our usual</i>
<i>bubble bath chicken nugget</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:42.645
<i>banter-- it was all business.</i>

17:42.729 --> 17:44.230
<i>I was back on the right side of the law.</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:46.358
<i>So why did it feel so wrong?</i>

17:46.441 --> 17:48.735
<i>Frond banned handy prancing for good.</i>

17:48.818 --> 17:50.236
<i>The case was closed.</i>

17:50.320 --> 17:52.280
<i>And the school was</i>
<i>about to be open... housed.</i>

17:52.364 --> 17:53.698
<i>Open housed.</i>

17:53.782 --> 17:55.992
Okay, Tina, let's test out the video.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.745
No! Don't turn the camera on.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.122
Play the video called
"Wagstaff Faces and Places."

18:01.206 --> 18:02.207
Sorry.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.669
<i>I didn't sleep a wink that night.</i>

18:05.752 --> 18:07.754
<i>Normally, I have restless leg syndrome.</i>

18:07.837 --> 18:09.714
<i>But that night,</i>
<i>I had restless finger syndrome.</i>

18:09.798 --> 18:11.466
<i>And that's when I had the idea.</i>

18:11.549 --> 18:13.134
<i>FROND:</i>
<i>And now...</i>

18:13.218 --> 18:15.553
Phillip Frond Productions
proudly presents:

18:15.637 --> 18:18.264
Walk on into Wagstaff,

18:18.348 --> 18:20.517
a full-day immersive experience

18:20.600 --> 18:23.269
that will have you saying, "Holy cow!"

18:23.353 --> 18:25.480
(chuckles) And, Tina, go.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.899
(exhales) Okay.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.655
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.156
Oh, look, a little dancing hand.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.742
I love it.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.327
This is a fun assembly.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.954
I thought it was gonna be
boring school stuff.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.497
(singsongy):
This feels like a good time for a burger,

18:42.580 --> 18:44.916
doesn't it? A not-mushy burger.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.419
Hmm, those buns look pretty smooshed.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.588
Unlike this bun-- oh, no, wait,
that's a tomato. Hang on.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.258
Tina! Tina, stop!

18:53.341 --> 18:56.011
<i>TINA: I'd made some phone calls</i>
<i>the night before.</i>

18:56.094 --> 18:57.595
<i>Told some finger friends</i>
<i>to wear their Sunday best,</i>

18:57.679 --> 18:58.930
<i>even though it was a Friday.</i>

18:59.014 --> 19:00.056
<i>And since Gene and Louise</i>

19:00.140 --> 19:01.433
<i>were always surprising me,</i>

19:01.516 --> 19:03.476
<i>I thought I'd surprise them for once.</i>

19:03.560 --> 19:05.270
(chuckles):
Tina, you son of a bitch.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.730
Hey, go on up there, Gene.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.565
Give us a Mavis moment.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.567
Nah, this is Holly Monitors' show.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.945
I'm just gonna use these to do this.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.825
So, what, is she suspended or something?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.368
I thought it was cute.

19:20.452 --> 19:23.079
Well, lucky for Tina,
so did the superintendent.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.831
She said it was the first creative thing

19:24.914 --> 19:27.250
she's ever seen me do,
so I took credit for it.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.002
Oh. So I'm not in trouble?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.838
No, but if I ever see
those fingers again...

19:31.921 --> 19:34.424
(stammers) I'm sorry, did you just take

19:34.507 --> 19:36.134
french fries out of your armpit?

19:36.217 --> 19:37.594
Yeah! You want some?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.429
-They're great.
-I have some, too.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.222
Uh, kind of near my butt.
A baggie slid down.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.891
I think we're done here.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.311
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>I sure was gonna miss Holly Monitors.</i>

19:46.394 --> 19:48.688
<i>But then, I guess, a little</i>
<i>part of me will always be</i>

19:48.772 --> 19:51.775
<i>-Holly Monitors-- the hand part.</i>
-(knocking)

19:53.401 --> 19:55.236
Mavis. How'd you know where to find me?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.030
GENE (high-pitched):
I asked around.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.073
(normal voice):
Can we come in?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.949
So it was you who told Mr. Frond?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.327
But why? You were on top of the world.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.746
Sure, it started that way. At first,

20:04.829 --> 20:07.874
<i>-I loved the attention.</i>
-ALL (chanting): Mavis! Mavis! Mavis!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.834
<i>But what began as an occasional gig</i>

20:09.918 --> 20:11.670
<i>turned into an every lunchtime thing.</i>

20:11.753 --> 20:14.798
<i>I was missing so many gorditas,</i>
<i>so many ham sandwiches.</i>

20:14.881 --> 20:17.217
<i>But Louise didn't want me</i>
<i>to stop. She was getting rich.</i>

20:17.300 --> 20:19.886
<i>I was having a good time, but</i>
<i>it was wearing a little thin.</i>

20:19.969 --> 20:23.056
(high-pitched): Thinner than the elastic
on my favorite finger tube top.

20:23.139 --> 20:26.059
<i>Mr. Frond put the screws</i>
<i>to me and I let it all out.</i>

20:26.142 --> 20:27.310
<i>I told him everything! Everything!</i>

20:27.394 --> 20:28.687
You didn't have to tell him, Gene.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.480
I threw him off the scent
with a really good lie

20:30.563 --> 20:32.357
that everyone was just doing
a lot of studying these days.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.901
Frankly, it was a relief.
The spotlight isn't always

20:34.984 --> 20:36.861
what it's cracked up to be, kid.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.905
I love being Mavis,
but sometimes you just want to

20:38.988 --> 20:40.532
use your fingers for lickin' and pickin'.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.742
And occasionally flickin'.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.035
I'm sorry I didn't tell you right away.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.412
And I'm sorry I didn't tell Louise.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.080
You loved handy prancing and she loved

20:47.163 --> 20:49.249
-all that candy and money.
-That's okay.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.126
Well, would you ever want to...

20:51.209 --> 20:53.086
-tread the boards at home with me?
-(high-pitched): Honey,

20:53.169 --> 20:55.171
all you had to do was ask.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.961
