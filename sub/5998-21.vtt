Ah, wait.

an ice maker.

perfectly clear ice cube?

02:03.824 --> 02:06.492

02:06.494 --> 02:09.128
- So it's pretty awesome,
right?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.230
- Yeah, it keeps
the drink cold.

a little overwhelmed right now.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.805

10:06.807 --> 10:09.274
- I'll take him

10:09.276 --> 10:12.110
while we try and find him
a new foster family.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.280

of Apparatus and Equipment??

11:25.452 --> 11:27.352

11:41.401 --> 11:44.736
The boy, Louie,
he was a foster kid.

11:44.738 --> 11:48.339
- Hey, you did great with him
at the scene, Dawson.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.142
You kept him nice and calm.
Ain't easy to do.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.011
- I tried.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.181
He kept crying for his blanket
he left back at the apartment.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.149
Kid's been moved around so much,

11:58.151 --> 12:00.318
it's probably the only real
belonging he's got.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.091
- Let's take a ride.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.926
Come on, guys.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.895
- We dive out onto the aerial,
a couple seconds later,

12:10.897 --> 12:12.797
boom, the roof gives way.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.998
The whole top floor is toast.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.734
I'm lucky to be sitting here
right now.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.335
- What was behind the bed?

12:17.337 --> 12:21.740
- The point is, we would have
got out of there

12:21.742 --> 12:24.209
a hell of a lot sooner
if we had had these masks.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.278
- Look, I know you guys like to
have the newest, shiniest toys,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.047
but those things
cost an arm and a leg.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.015
- Chief, I'm talking about
technology

12:31.017 --> 12:34.119
that's gonna save lives--
firefighters and civilians.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.420
- I understand.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.355
But I'm telling you
that the money isn't there.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.758
- How can the budget
be maxed out?

12:39.760 --> 12:43.962
I haven't heard of any major
new equipment allocations.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.764
- Well, Lieutenant,
there's a lot you don't know

12:45.766 --> 12:47.766
about how budgets
and allocations work.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.335
- Why don't you
help me understand?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.771
- You got an alderman
in your house now, don't you?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.038
Why are you breaking my balls?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.774
Get him to explain it to you.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.778
- Thanks for your time,
Chief.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.346
- You got it, Kelly.

<i>I think that it's something</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:10.388

13:10.390 --> 13:13.291
I read an article,
and the thing is, I mean,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.560
have you seen the stats
on U.S. beer consumption?

13:15.562 --> 13:19.364
It's way down,
whereas cocktails are way up!

13:19.366 --> 13:21.366
- Read about that.
It's confounding.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.270
- Hey, you're gonna need
a tiebreaker.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.971
- Right?

13:26.973 --> 13:29.207
Come on, Dawson,
help a sister out.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.075
- Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.211
- Say hey to Louie for us.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.883
- Dawson's onboard.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.518
- She didn't say that.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.089
- This is so thoughtful of you.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.525
- Well, Louie seemed
pretty attached.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.060
- I noticed.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.829
He didn't take his eyes
off of you.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.164
- Oh, I--
[laughs]

13:53.166 --> 13:54.566
I meant to the blanket.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.569
- Oh, yes.

13:57.571 --> 14:01.506
Well, I'll make sure he gets it
for bedtime tonight.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.241
- Great.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.014
Um...

14:10.016 --> 14:11.449
he doesn't have any family?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.351
- None on record.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.552
Birth mom was an addict,

14:14.554 --> 14:16.287
gave him up
when he was an infant.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.455
- Damn.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.290
Kid can't catch a break.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.626
- Because of
what he's been through,

14:21.628 --> 14:24.295
he's going to need
special attention,

14:24.297 --> 14:27.298
so he might be difficult
to place,

14:27.300 --> 14:31.436
but he's still young enough,
he's got a shot.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.204
We'll do our best.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.441
- Hope so.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.176
He deserves that.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.582
- Okay, wait a minute.
I-I'm sorry.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.150
I'm not understanding
the metaphor.

14:46.152 --> 14:49.387
- Okay, we tried to handle this
the easy way.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.956
We sent in our drones.
They missed the target.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.626
So now it's time to put boots
on the ground.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.161
- If he said the bruising
has gone away--

14:57.163 --> 15:00.932
Otis gets a hangnail, he doesn't
shut up about it for a week.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.969
- Okay, how do we put the boots
on the ground?

15:04.971 --> 15:07.939
- We bring in the Green Berets.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.077
- Baba?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.479
- Baba.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.457
No, no, Baba.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.160

too far.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.328

Thank you, Baba.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.295

16:32.725 --> 16:34.459

16:49.342 --> 16:51.409

No one knows.

the cardiac monitor on him.

17:07.259 --> 17:10.361

We were gonna post it
on YouTube.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.788
But we didn't think drinking
a bottle would hurt him.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.290
- A bottle?
What type of alcohol?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.826
- It wasn't alcohol.
It was soy sauce.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.662
This much.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.633
- It's 20 ounces.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.769
- That much sodium,
he could be hypernatremic.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.205
We need to get fluids
going fast.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.273
- Will that fix him?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.542
- There's no way to know.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.111
Sodium overdoses can be fatal.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.847
- We wanted to call 911 as soon
as he started throwing up,

18:02.849 --> 18:04.849
but he told us he was fine.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.656
- The way I understand it,

18:11.658 --> 18:14.592
a certain amount of money is
allocated for fire and police,

18:14.594 --> 18:17.829
and anything left over gets
diverted to political funds.

18:17.831 --> 18:21.599
So maybe Chief Barr is under
pressure from Alderman Hilbert

18:21.601 --> 18:22.767
not to spend all of his budget.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.202
- Alderman Hilbert?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.671
- Chairman of the Police
and Fire Committee.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.439
- So money for Fire and Police

18:28.441 --> 18:30.308
ends up getting used
for something else altogether.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.543
- Correct.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.845
- So that's it?

18:33.847 --> 18:37.715
No masks, no matter how many
lives they might save?

18:37.717 --> 18:40.551

18:42.122 --> 18:44.355

committee.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.290
Maybe he can help me
put pressure on Hilbert,

18:46.292 --> 18:48.593
get him to spend that money
where it should be spent.

18:48.595 --> 18:52.497
Hi, this is Alderman Casey.
Is David available?

18:54.366 --> 18:56.467
Yes, David.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.604
Good, good.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:12.918 --> 19:16.387
- So Otis hasn't even looked
at me since we brought Baba in.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.561
- You know,
we had a call today.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.298
A college kid drank a bottle
of soy sauce on a dare.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.601
By the time we dropped him at
the hospital, he was in a coma.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.436
I don't think he'll make it.

19:35.207 --> 19:36.641
- Wow, that's rough.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.644
- His friends waited too long
to call it in,

19:39.646 --> 19:41.779
'cause the kid kept saying
he was fine.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.518
We did the right thing.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.525
- Ha ha, here we go.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.661
Batch number one.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.329
Like diamonds, right?

19:58.331 --> 20:00.364
- If diamonds were worthless.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.768
- Herrmann,
these are not worthless.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.903
People pay extra for these.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.506
- Seriously?

20:08.508 --> 20:11.642
Like...how much extra?
A dollar?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.578
- No, maybe on Rush Street,
but here?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.646
We could probably get 50¢.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.648
- 50 whole cents?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.717
Let me break it down.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.486
So we sell about 100 cocktails
a night on average.

20:22.488 --> 20:26.390
Pop one of these in each glass,
that's 50 extra bucks a night.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.894
Herrmann, this machine
pays for itself in two weeks.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.662
From then on?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.598
Pure profit.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.375
- Looks pretty damn good.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.644
- Yeah, melts slower

20:46.646 --> 20:48.279

20:55.387 --> 20:56.821
- Yep, that's cold.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.358
- Okay, so how much extra
would you be willing to pay

21:00.360 --> 21:02.526
for a premium cube like that?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.532
- Uh...a quarter?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.637
50¢?

21:14.339 --> 21:16.874
Yeah.
Yeah, 50¢.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.013
- Kidd, I'm glad I brought you

21:32.025 --> 21:34.759
Mm, I figured you were
just paying me back

21:34.761 --> 21:36.527

out of that fire.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.895
- Is that what happened?

21:37.897 --> 21:40.298
- Hell, yeah.
I saved your life.

you finally came in--

21:50.410 --> 21:52.977
- Is it leukemia?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.546
- No.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.949
Because of your concern,
we tested for that.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.053
But we're dealing with
a serious condition,

22:02.055 --> 22:06.590
called Immune thrombocytopenia,
okay, or ITP.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.392
It's a platelet disorder.

22:08.394 --> 22:11.662
- Never heard of it, so
how serious can it be, right?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.964
- Your body is low
on platelets,

22:13.966 --> 22:16.467
so your blood
isn't clotting properly,

22:16.469 --> 22:18.402
hence the bruising you saw.

22:18.404 --> 22:21.539
You're very lucky it hasn't
caused any real damage.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.909
When untreated, it can lead
to bleeding in the brain.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.644
- What's the treatment?

22:26.646 --> 22:28.813
- Well, we have a couple options
going forward,

22:28.815 --> 22:30.414
corticosteroids,

22:30.416 --> 22:32.850
and/or intravenous infusions
of immune globulin.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.120

to work, right?

22:44.063 --> 22:47.665
No, we need to get that
platelet count normalized.

22:47.667 --> 22:51.402
- But I'll be back
on the job soon, right?

22:51.404 --> 22:54.605

for sure right now.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.700
- What's that?

40:03.702 --> 40:06.903
- When I'm married,
you break into my house

40:06.905 --> 40:11.841
with flowers and champagne,
and then I'm solo,

40:11.843 --> 40:17.180
and you just keep
a nice, safe distance.

40:19.617 --> 40:21.785
So...

40:21.787 --> 40:25.121
I was thinking that we could
put the first coat of mud,

40:25.123 --> 40:27.424
and let it dry...

40:27.426 --> 40:29.559
- Next coat tomorrow?
- And then--yeah, exactly.

40:29.561 --> 40:32.829
You know, assuming I can ever
get this sheet up.

40:32.831 --> 40:33.963
- Well, between the two of us?

40:33.965 --> 40:35.765
Come on,
piece of cake.
