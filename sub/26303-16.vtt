WEBVTT

00:06.460 --> 00:07.699
Good morning.

00:09.159 --> 00:11.827
Ah, the man gets up early.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.300
Price just caught up
with Kelton in the polls.

00:15.335 --> 00:17.736
So I got a lot of work to do.

00:19.806 --> 00:21.173
Like... like what?

00:21.207 --> 00:24.676
Like digging into Price
a little bit more.

00:24.711 --> 00:26.595
I need to find a contradiction

00:26.630 --> 00:29.045
that belies this Alderman's
man-of-the-people narrative.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.406
Like the good Christian
George W. Bush hiding a DUI?

00:32.439 --> 00:34.241
Something like that.

00:34.275 --> 00:36.310
- Just bigger.
- Exactly.

00:36.344 --> 00:37.811
Ooh!

00:37.845 --> 00:39.815
Hey, what's your take on Price?

00:40.515 --> 00:43.317
I didn't know I was part
of your opposition research.

00:43.351 --> 00:44.818
Sorry, I... I'm...

00:44.852 --> 00:46.320
It's all right. It's fine.

00:46.354 --> 00:48.088
Okay, Price, um,

00:48.122 --> 00:50.490
I don't know, he's classic,
old school Chicago, right?

00:50.525 --> 00:54.371
He's a charming, deal making,
self-serving hypocrite,

00:55.530 --> 00:56.830
but, like, in a good way.

00:56.864 --> 00:59.251
- In a good way.
- Stop talking business.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.604
Usual seat, Councilman?

01:04.638 --> 01:07.174
No, I have some business
to attend to, Claire.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.176
Thanks for coming, Hank. Sorry I'm late.

01:09.210 --> 01:11.778
Hey. I understand you're a busy man.

01:11.813 --> 01:13.847
Helps this coffee's good.

01:13.881 --> 01:15.682
Uh, everything is good in this place.

01:15.717 --> 01:18.385
Black owned and operated since 1970.

01:18.419 --> 01:19.766
My pops used to take me here.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.023
Yeah?

01:21.889 --> 01:23.590
You've seen the latest poll numbers?

01:23.624 --> 01:25.359
It's a dead heat.

01:25.393 --> 01:29.531
First time since I announced,
but I'll be upfront.

01:29.931 --> 01:32.417
Kelton's got a huge war chest.

01:32.452 --> 01:34.301
He's got D.C. political consultants

01:34.335 --> 01:35.435
digging in my backyard.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.870
Now you know how this city works,

01:36.904 --> 01:38.081
how I get things done.

01:38.712 --> 01:41.014
I need to fight back any way I can.

01:41.843 --> 01:43.420
I need your help.

01:43.745 --> 01:46.079
Look, I told you, I don't
get involved in politics.

01:46.114 --> 01:47.616
It's not my thing, Ray.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.216
Yeah, well, maybe you should.

01:49.251 --> 01:52.386
It's like that John Donne poem
says, "No man is an island."

01:52.420 --> 01:55.489
Look, I got to run.
I got an operation in play.

01:55.523 --> 01:56.892
If Kelton is elected,

01:57.492 --> 01:59.059
he'll bust up Intelligence

01:59.093 --> 02:01.561
as soon as he takes his hand
off that damn bible

02:01.596 --> 02:02.836
and you know that.

02:02.870 --> 02:04.191
I do.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.601
Enjoy your breakfast.

02:09.770 --> 02:10.914
All right, we got new ones.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.266
See, you got to press this twice

02:12.309 --> 02:13.771
- and it'll start recording.
- How are we doing?

02:13.806 --> 02:16.743
They want me to lose my
St. Francis necklace, Hank.

02:16.778 --> 02:18.225
You know that ain't gonna happen.

02:18.259 --> 02:19.657
I was just telling her,

02:19.691 --> 02:21.426
St. Francis, St. Jude,
people think police.

02:21.461 --> 02:24.046
- Your CI, your call.
- It stays.

02:24.081 --> 02:25.419
Oh, well, they're not gonna
notice anyway.

02:25.453 --> 02:27.187
They're going to be
too distracted by whatever

02:27.221 --> 02:28.404
this new thing is you got going on

02:28.438 --> 02:29.650
with your hair over there, Lexie.

02:29.684 --> 02:32.157
Ask me, maybe you should worry
about your own appearance, Adam.

02:32.192 --> 02:33.403
What are you talking about?

02:33.428 --> 02:36.557
That beard. It's time for a shave, bro.

02:36.964 --> 02:38.965
Lexie, you're the one that
told me to go with it.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.376
I told you to go with it,
not let it take over.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.871
Okay, enough beard talk. You ready?

02:44.906 --> 02:46.940
I've been ready for a year
to take down LeMonte.

02:46.974 --> 02:49.609
Punk has third graders
slinging dope for him.

02:49.644 --> 02:50.777
Give us a sec.

02:50.812 --> 02:52.364
Yeah, you got it. See ya, Lex.

02:52.814 --> 02:54.948
Listen, I don't want you
in the room on this one.

02:54.982 --> 02:58.385
Just play it cool,
make the intro, walk away.

02:58.419 --> 02:59.705
I got you.

03:00.154 --> 03:03.166
You know, last time we did this
was with your boy, Olinsky.

03:03.658 --> 03:05.210
He was a good dude.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.587
I bet you miss him.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.299
I do.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.845
It's a crazy, unfair world, Hank.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.221
You got that right, Lex.

03:18.905 --> 03:20.851
Let's go get this punk.

03:21.776 --> 03:24.044
Aye, take five real quick?

03:24.078 --> 03:26.746
I'm not gonna lie to you,
man, they sound good.

03:26.781 --> 03:28.882
All right, listen, as I was saying,

03:28.916 --> 03:31.151
now since my regular supplier got busted,

03:31.185 --> 03:33.987
I got buyers from Rogers Park
to Lincoln Park

03:34.021 --> 03:35.388
just waiting in line.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.023
So paper's not a problem, the product is.

03:37.058 --> 03:38.284
And I'm hearing a lot of talk.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.578
I hear ya.

03:40.795 --> 03:43.363
All right, listen to this.

03:47.164 --> 03:48.583
60 a brick.

03:48.608 --> 03:51.840
Once I start buying in bulk,
I say we do 55.

03:52.874 --> 03:54.932
Told you he was for real, LeMonte.

03:54.966 --> 03:56.513
And what's your take in all this?

03:56.548 --> 03:58.177
You two do business,

03:58.212 --> 04:00.766
he breaks me off 10%
of the first three purchases.

04:01.791 --> 04:03.525
Hold up.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.260
Where'd you meet this white boy again?

04:05.295 --> 04:07.763
I told you, he's a customer.
I've known him for two years.

04:07.797 --> 04:10.465
- Two years?
- He's cool, LeMonte. Chill.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.534
Where was this bitch dancing
two years ago?

04:12.569 --> 04:16.031
Seven Veils off Wabash, easy.

04:17.574 --> 04:20.541
She gave me the best
lap dance of my life.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.245
All right, you can go.

04:26.316 --> 04:28.217
We cool?

04:28.251 --> 04:29.618
Business time.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.525
Finest of the fine.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.228
Make sure it's all in there.

04:39.262 --> 04:41.630
Good as gold.

04:41.664 --> 04:43.999
Chicago PD! Nuh-uh!

04:44.033 --> 04:45.086
Come on.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.769
Everybody's under arrest.
Put your hands up.

04:48.338 --> 04:50.305
You can go higher than that.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.932
I'm serious, though. That was
just... it was a thing of beauty.

04:53.966 --> 04:55.104
A thing of beauty.

04:55.139 --> 04:57.570
The look on LeMonte's face,
he didn't even see that coming.

04:57.623 --> 04:59.123
Yeah, you see how LeMonte grabbed me?

04:59.158 --> 05:00.925
- Yes, ma'am.
- Damn, I nearly punched him.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.196
Right, but you kept cool.

05:02.230 --> 05:03.661
But you, uh, next time an officer

05:03.695 --> 05:04.867
tells you to raise your hands

05:04.892 --> 05:06.027
you can raise them
a little higher than that.

05:06.071 --> 05:07.467
- I raised my hands.
- Yeah, I'm with Kev.

05:07.502 --> 05:08.581
It's totally disrespectful, man.

05:08.615 --> 05:09.966
You could've blown the whole operation.

05:10.001 --> 05:12.616
Yeah, all right. Hey, Lexie,
nicely done yet again.

05:12.650 --> 05:14.063
Thank you. Salud.

05:14.098 --> 05:16.299
- Cheers.
- Lexie! Lex?

05:18.210 --> 05:21.879
- Hey.
- Good job, great job.

05:21.914 --> 05:23.481
I put a little something extra in there.

05:23.515 --> 05:24.782
A little going away present.

05:24.817 --> 05:27.018
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:27.052 --> 05:28.893
Part of me is going to miss
all this craziness.

05:28.927 --> 05:29.855
Hmm.

05:30.516 --> 05:32.317
A very small part.

05:33.225 --> 05:35.293
I can't believe you're really moving.

05:35.327 --> 05:37.295
- My mom's pretty sick.
- I'm sorry.

05:37.329 --> 05:39.964
Needs help. Flying back
to Ohio tomorrow morning.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.645
Let me give you a lift to the airport.

05:41.670 --> 05:42.870
Ah, you don't have to do that.

05:42.895 --> 05:44.329
I'll pick up coffee.

05:44.354 --> 05:45.688
Two sugars.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.448
And a splash of cream, I know.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.174
I'll see you in the morning.

05:49.199 --> 05:50.625
See you later.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.050
Lexie?

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:13.258 --> 06:18.896
5021 squad, signs of forced
entry at 6145 South Racine.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.721
I'm inside the residence.

06:20.746 --> 06:23.814
- Roll a couple of cars this way.
<i>- Copy, 5021.</i>

06:43.248 --> 06:44.971
Lexie?

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:15.627 --> 07:18.329
Hey, roll the crime lab to this address.

07:18.363 --> 07:20.264
Got a neighbor who said
she heard a scream

07:20.299 --> 07:22.233
come from Lexie's place
around 5:30 this morning.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.006
- She called it in?
- Of course not.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.169
Just got off with CPIC.

07:25.204 --> 07:26.668
They're putting on
an endangered missing report.

07:26.702 --> 07:28.606
No, no, no. Listen to me.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.942
You get back to them, have 'em
lodge an All-Call BOLO

07:30.976 --> 07:32.343
over all citywides on my order.

07:32.377 --> 07:33.911
- All right, Sarge?
- Yeah.

07:33.946 --> 07:35.346
Lexie hasn't popped up in any hospitals.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.852
They haven't seen her around
the club either.

07:36.887 --> 07:38.918
All right, listen, Lexie
might've cut the offender

07:38.953 --> 07:41.085
with her scissors,
scratched him with her nails.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.121
You tell the techs we might get lucky.

07:43.155 --> 07:44.514
Find his blood in the system.

07:44.514 --> 07:45.633
I got it, Sarge.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.217
You think anybody knew she
set up LeMonte Washington?

07:48.251 --> 07:50.328
Oh, I'm thinking everything.

07:51.254 --> 07:52.822
All right, anyone who
ever threatened her,

07:52.856 --> 07:54.290
anyone and everyone in her life.

07:54.324 --> 07:55.821
I'll set up a list of possibilities.

07:55.855 --> 07:57.627
Good, I want all hands on deck.

07:57.661 --> 08:01.197
PODS, surveillance, registered
sex offenders in the area.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.466
You check all in-service calls
to this block.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.843
We'll find her, Sarge.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.906
Where we at?

08:10.941 --> 08:12.408
I talked to a CI close to LeMonte's crew.

08:12.442 --> 08:14.143
Far as he knows, he didn't order a hit.

08:14.177 --> 08:16.312
I ran Lexie's phone records.
One caller popped.

08:16.346 --> 08:18.180
Keith Stinson, he owns Scarlet Lace,

08:18.215 --> 08:19.482
the club where Lexie dances.

08:19.516 --> 08:22.267
He's got a prior for sexual
assault, called her four times.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.827
Last call was at 4:22am,

08:23.862 --> 08:25.755
an hour or so before the
witness heard the screaming.

08:25.789 --> 08:28.190
Techs found Stinson's prints in
three places in her apartment.

08:28.225 --> 08:29.725
Well, I'm sure he wasn't happy

08:29.760 --> 08:31.360
Lexie was moving back to Ohio.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.692
Right, so he probably went
over there; he confronted her.

08:33.717 --> 08:35.578
All right, you and me.
Let's go scoop him up.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.638
Sarge, why don't you let me
and Hailey go?

08:37.701 --> 08:39.168
What are you saying, Jay?

08:39.202 --> 08:41.379
Just saying let's get him the right way.

08:45.909 --> 08:47.218
Hailey.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.021
- Keith Stinson?
- Yeah.

08:55.055 --> 08:57.086
I'm Detective Halstead.
This is Detective Upton.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.088
This about Lexie?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.923
Uh, news travels fast.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.915
Why don't you come down to the
District? We'll talk about it.

09:02.949 --> 09:04.527
Sorry, I can't leave the club. Maybe...

09:04.561 --> 09:05.704
Where were you earlier this morning?

09:05.739 --> 09:06.884
Whoa, hold on. You think I
had something to do with it?

09:06.918 --> 09:08.864
Just answer the question.

09:08.899 --> 09:10.266
I was here until 6:00 a.m. Ask my girls.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.534
Besides women on your payroll,

09:11.568 --> 09:13.102
do you have surveillance to back that up?

09:13.136 --> 09:16.038
Yeah, lots of it.
Feel free to take a look.

09:17.574 --> 09:19.075
You ever been to Lexie's apartment?

09:19.109 --> 09:20.710
Of course, we've known
each other for years.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.712
All right, when's the
last time you spoke with her?

09:22.746 --> 09:24.980
Early morning, 3:00 a.m.,
end of her last shift.

09:25.015 --> 09:26.415
She took off in a hurry.

09:26.450 --> 09:27.795
Some creepy customer was looking for her.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.452
Said he wanted to give her a big tip.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.087
Kept calling her
to make sure she was okay,

09:31.121 --> 09:32.321
but she didn't pick up.

09:32.355 --> 09:34.090
What did this customer look like?

09:34.124 --> 09:36.225
White dude, tall.

09:36.259 --> 09:39.020
That's about all I remember.
Didn't get a good look at him.

09:39.930 --> 09:41.564
I'm telling you, me and Lexie are cool.

09:41.598 --> 09:43.900
I want to help anyway I can.
Just let me know what you need.

09:45.669 --> 09:46.694
We will.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.577
I'll catch up with you in a sec.

09:59.649 --> 10:01.984
I'm Hailey. I'm with CPD.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.185
Do you know Lexie?

10:03.220 --> 10:05.255
Yeah, I heard what happened.

10:05.789 --> 10:07.215
Name's Devon.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.593
Was she having problems
with anyone, Devon?

10:10.627 --> 10:11.927
Boyfriend, customer?

10:11.962 --> 10:13.429
Nah, no boyfriend.

10:13.463 --> 10:14.930
As far as customers...

10:14.965 --> 10:16.332
She's pretty tough.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.768
I mean, she can handle just about
anybody that came her way.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.504
What y'all doing here anyway?

10:21.538 --> 10:24.440
CPD usually don't do nothing
when dancers disappear.

10:24.474 --> 10:25.608
What do you mean?

10:26.067 --> 10:28.511
A few years ago, when
dancers started going missing,

10:28.545 --> 10:32.882
three ended up in dumpsters
and the others just...

10:32.916 --> 10:34.717
they just never came home.

10:34.751 --> 10:36.018
Still missing today.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.987
Yeah, I've been on the job for a while.

10:38.021 --> 10:39.822
I haven't heard about any of this.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.357
Exactly.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.159
Four strippers on
the south side go missing.

10:43.193 --> 10:44.894
Cops don't do nothing.

10:44.928 --> 10:46.562
Rich white girl disappears,

10:46.596 --> 10:48.590
and y'all bring in the damn FBI.

10:49.666 --> 10:50.866
When you're done working,

10:50.901 --> 10:52.234
I want you to come down to the District.

10:52.269 --> 10:53.511
I want to take a statement.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.807
If I come down, you got
to promise to do something.

10:57.841 --> 10:59.225
You have my word.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.099
Wait, three murdered dancers
and several others missing?

11:03.133 --> 11:04.180
That's what she said.

11:04.214 --> 11:06.432
- Does she sound credible?
- She sounded scared.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.683
I'm going to talk to her tonight,

11:07.717 --> 11:09.985
but I think we need to start
digging into this right away.

11:10.020 --> 11:11.270
Wait a second, might not have to.

11:11.305 --> 11:13.057
Asset Forfeiture got
a hit on Lexie's debit card.

11:13.091 --> 11:15.132
- They have an ID?
- Yeah, a guy named Tony Hill.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.186
Caught on security camera
using it at a convenience store

11:17.220 --> 11:19.630
two hours ago. He's a
three-time convicted felon.

11:19.664 --> 11:21.289
He lives around the corner from Lexie.

11:24.234 --> 11:26.836
- Ruz, have you got anything?
<i>- I got nothing.</i>

11:30.140 --> 11:32.408
Oh, looks like Tony Hill to me.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.076
We got him.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.249
Don't you do it.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.184
Don't do that, Tony.

11:42.219 --> 11:44.720
- Damn.
- I'll get the alley.

11:47.390 --> 11:49.792
Tony! Stop, police!

11:54.624 --> 11:56.282
CPD! Stop!

11:57.734 --> 11:59.201
Tony!

11:59.236 --> 12:01.370
I said stop!

12:01.404 --> 12:03.539
- Hold it right there!
- Get on the hood!

12:03.573 --> 12:05.808
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

12:05.842 --> 12:07.376
You got cuffs in there?

12:07.410 --> 12:09.111
Yeah, yeah. Here you go.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.746
- Hands behind your back, man.
- Let's go.

12:10.780 --> 12:11.947
Hands behind your back, Tony.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.551
Okay, man.

12:18.355 --> 12:20.645
I'm telling you, I don't know
nothing about no missing stripper.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.323
So you ran, why? The exercise?

12:22.358 --> 12:24.476
I didn't wanna get jammed up.
I just got out of prison!

12:24.511 --> 12:26.295
Yup, I know.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.940
You've done three stretches for burglary.

12:29.432 --> 12:31.767
You're not a very good criminal, Tony.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.671
This is you using her ATM card

12:35.705 --> 12:38.007
two hours after she went missing.

12:38.041 --> 12:41.010
Cooperate, we can work out a deal.

12:41.044 --> 12:42.328
If not...

12:45.715 --> 12:48.384
It's going to be a very long night.

12:55.558 --> 12:58.160
I was walking home from a friend's house

12:58.194 --> 12:59.804
and I heard a scream.

13:00.163 --> 13:02.431
I turned a corner.
I saw a blue van leaving.

13:02.465 --> 13:03.699
And I saw an apartment door open.

13:03.733 --> 13:06.001
I went inside to see if someone was hurt.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.603
Okay, what'd you see?

13:07.637 --> 13:09.104
Not much.

13:09.139 --> 13:11.674
And yeah, I took a purse, some jewelry,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.842
but I didn't see anyone.
I didn't hurt anyone.

13:13.867 --> 13:15.167
I swear on my mother.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.501
Look, I know I should've called the
police, but I don't have a job.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.407
All right, stop talking.

13:21.351 --> 13:22.618
Here's what's going to happen.

13:22.652 --> 13:24.053
You're going to write a statement.

13:24.087 --> 13:25.788
We're going to swab you for DNA.

13:26.656 --> 13:27.656
And then what?

13:28.082 --> 13:30.225
And then we put your ass
in our holding cell

13:30.260 --> 13:32.594
and we'll see if you're lying.

13:34.331 --> 13:35.731
What do you think?

13:35.765 --> 13:37.499
I think he's a tiny little
punk with no wounds

13:37.534 --> 13:39.301
to suggest he was in a struggle.

13:39.336 --> 13:40.869
Lexie would crush him with her pinkie.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.096
Yeah.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.509
What's up?

13:48.545 --> 13:51.146
Techs ran the unknown blood
you saw at Lexie's place.

13:51.181 --> 13:52.481
Came back as a white male.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.383
Okay, that rules out Hill.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.485
I had them run the sample against DNA

13:56.519 --> 13:59.388
from the other murdered dancers
and it was a match.

14:01.725 --> 14:03.848
Sarge, we're chasing a serial killer.

14:10.484 --> 14:11.515
Okay.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.518
This is Shanele Martin.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.911
She was found in a dumpster
with 18 puncture wounds

14:15.936 --> 14:17.136
to her face and torso.

14:17.170 --> 14:18.904
She was sexually assaulted.

14:18.939 --> 14:20.472
Her mother reported her missing,

14:20.507 --> 14:23.175
but never heard back from CPD
until they found the body.

14:23.209 --> 14:26.567
Techs also found the offender's
saliva on her body.

14:26.601 --> 14:30.749
Rachel Jones, 18 puncture
wounds, also face and torso,

14:30.784 --> 14:33.231
found in a dumpster near Garfield Park.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.088
Gina Ramirez, same ol' story.

14:36.122 --> 14:40.025
18 puncture wounds, found near
Garfield Park, dancer.

14:40.363 --> 14:42.161
All these happened in 2016.

14:42.195 --> 14:43.862
According to the M.E. reports,

14:43.897 --> 14:48.067
he kept them alive for 24 hours
then he stabbed them to death

14:48.101 --> 14:51.170
and tossed their bodies into
dumpsters like they're trash.

14:51.204 --> 14:53.072
All three victims, same M.O.

14:53.106 --> 14:55.441
So Homicide knew they had a serial.

14:55.475 --> 14:58.377
Not necessarily, they only
had DNA on one of the victims.

14:58.411 --> 15:00.297
Maybe they were still investigating.

15:00.331 --> 15:02.281
Or maybe they just didn't
give a rat's ass.

15:02.315 --> 15:03.383
Possible.

15:03.417 --> 15:05.551
Three victims, cooling off period...

15:05.585 --> 15:06.807
that's serial killer 101.

15:06.842 --> 15:08.028
The Feds were called in, right?

15:08.062 --> 15:10.789
There are no FBI reports in any of
the files that I've looked through

15:10.824 --> 15:12.891
and these girls are all still missing.

15:12.926 --> 15:15.260
All dancers,
all lived near Garfield Park.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.296
Who was the lead on Homicide?

15:17.591 --> 15:19.725
Leo Hernandez handled all three cases.

15:19.759 --> 15:22.136
I know Leo, he's good police.
You call him?

15:22.170 --> 15:24.712
Yeah, I called. Got word back
that he's out of state,

15:24.746 --> 15:26.238
watching a witness in protective custody.

15:26.272 --> 15:28.240
His whereabouts are unknown.

15:28.619 --> 15:30.909
All right. Who was Hernandez's
area commander at the time?

15:30.944 --> 15:32.544
Brian Kelton.

15:34.314 --> 15:35.914
Okay, what else we got?

15:35.949 --> 15:38.217
Looks like the killings
stopped for about three years.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.952
No homicides, no disappearances

15:39.986 --> 15:42.167
with the same M.O. or DNA until now.

15:42.201 --> 15:43.489
But how do we know the offender kept

15:43.523 --> 15:45.324
the girls alive for 24 hours?

15:45.358 --> 15:47.393
Ligature marks and bruising
patterns on the bodies.

15:47.427 --> 15:51.302
Techs also found trace amounts
of unique cement granules

15:51.336 --> 15:53.282
on their clothes,
which can't be a coincidence.

15:53.316 --> 15:54.967
It means he's keeping them
in some kind of cellar.

15:55.001 --> 15:56.640
Okay, okay, so that...

15:56.675 --> 15:58.636
that means Lexie might still be alive.

15:58.661 --> 16:00.195
I mean, she's only been missing, what?

16:00.230 --> 16:01.553
Six hours?

16:01.554 --> 16:03.022
All right, so hit the streets.

16:03.056 --> 16:05.491
Talk to your CIs,
especially your dancer Cis,

16:05.525 --> 16:07.526
and dig back into those old case files.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.728
See if there's anything we can use.

16:10.797 --> 16:12.398
Look, I don't need to tell you guys

16:12.432 --> 16:14.749
how much Lexie's helped us
over the years.

16:15.535 --> 16:18.336
Now's the time that we do
the same for her.

16:18.738 --> 16:20.839
And if this animal keeps to his routine,

16:20.874 --> 16:23.758
that means we got about 18
hours left to find her alive.

16:27.113 --> 16:28.914
Let's go.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.251
Hernandez, it's Hank Voight again.

16:32.285 --> 16:35.645
Look, I know you're jammed.
Just call me when you can.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.556
Superintendent.

16:37.590 --> 16:38.924
I just got word we have a serial.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.426
It looks that way.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.894
As a matter of fact, you were involved

16:41.928 --> 16:43.929
in some of the earlier homicides.

16:43.963 --> 16:45.464
I was the area commander.

16:45.498 --> 16:47.399
Well, we've been combing
through the old files.

16:47.434 --> 16:48.634
Anything pop in your memory?

16:48.668 --> 16:50.769
Any suspects you were chasing?

16:50.804 --> 16:52.438
As I recall, we didn't even have a lead,

16:52.472 --> 16:54.373
let alone a suspect,

16:54.407 --> 16:56.208
and that was 2016. It was a bad year.

16:56.242 --> 16:58.243
Over 700 homicides citywide.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.146
Well, look, I'm trying
to get in touch with Hernandez.

17:01.181 --> 17:03.248
I want to get his take on all this,

17:03.283 --> 17:05.451
but he's with a witness
in protective custody.

17:05.484 --> 17:07.086
- I'll find him.
- Appreciate that.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.555
Sure thing. I'm told that
you know the missing girl.

17:09.589 --> 17:11.589
I do, yeah. She's been a CI for years.

17:11.624 --> 17:14.593
She's helped us put away
a lot of bad people.

17:14.627 --> 17:16.595
She deserves everything we got.

17:16.628 --> 17:20.265
Understood, but
considering how close you are,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.166
why not let Homicide handle this?

17:22.202 --> 17:24.269
Because the clock is ticking.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.671
Just getting Homicide up to speed

17:25.704 --> 17:27.772
is gonna waste time we don't have.

17:29.509 --> 17:31.443
I want updates regularly

17:31.478 --> 17:33.238
and loop in Donahue in Homicide.

17:33.272 --> 17:34.418
Done.

17:34.452 --> 17:36.601
- Officers.
- Superintendent.

17:36.635 --> 17:37.716
What's up?

17:37.751 --> 17:39.336
Sarge, Stinson's alibi ain't holding up.

17:39.370 --> 17:41.587
He was AWOL from his club
from 5:00 to 6:00.

17:41.621 --> 17:44.656
Techs pinged his cell phone a block
away from Lexie's place at 5:15.

17:44.691 --> 17:46.825
About the same time
the neighbor heard a scream.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.128
Yes, sir, and, boss,
they also found some texts.

17:49.162 --> 17:52.030
That whole "I like Lexie"
story, that's crap.

17:52.065 --> 17:53.378
I'm gonna read one for you.

17:53.412 --> 17:56.869
"Bitch, this isn't over just
because you're leaving town."

17:59.506 --> 18:01.507
Where is he?

18:07.313 --> 18:09.047
Hey, fellas.

18:09.082 --> 18:10.649
What's the word on Lexie?

18:10.683 --> 18:13.519
Break's over, ladies.
Give us a little privacy.

18:17.257 --> 18:19.358
What the hell is this?

18:19.392 --> 18:20.826
What happened to Lexie?

18:20.860 --> 18:22.694
- I have no idea.
- Stop lying.

18:22.729 --> 18:24.463
- I'm not lying.
- You're lying.

18:24.497 --> 18:25.998
You're lying.

18:26.032 --> 18:28.133
We know you were outside of her apartment

18:28.168 --> 18:31.470
and we read your text messages, so
we know you threatened her too.

18:31.504 --> 18:33.138
Those weren't threats.

18:33.173 --> 18:34.339
I was upset she was leaving.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.574
She made a lot of money for the club.

18:35.608 --> 18:37.975
I gave her a raise and she promised
to stay through the summer.

18:38.711 --> 18:40.379
You know what?
I'm not saying another word.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.147
You guys are looking to pin
this on someone

18:42.182 --> 18:43.482
and I'm the easy target.

18:43.516 --> 18:45.184
Why don't you have a seat?

18:45.218 --> 18:47.052
Whoa! What?

18:51.724 --> 18:53.926
What the hell are you...

18:56.463 --> 18:57.863
You ready to talk? Huh?

18:59.032 --> 19:00.933
Yeah!

19:00.967 --> 19:03.351
- Talk.
- I swear I didn't touch her!

19:03.386 --> 19:04.558
Please!

19:04.592 --> 19:06.338
- But you were there.
- She would...

19:06.372 --> 19:09.241
You were there! Huh?

19:11.224 --> 19:12.911
Yeah, yeah!

19:12.946 --> 19:14.868
I... I went to see her
but I didn't go in.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.201
All right, what stopped you?

19:16.236 --> 19:17.970
A blue van! I recognized it
from the club.

19:18.004 --> 19:19.596
The guy... the guy driving it
was some freak

19:19.630 --> 19:20.970
who sat in the back
of the club all night.

19:21.004 --> 19:22.403
How do you know it was his blue van?

19:22.437 --> 19:23.889
Not the first time he's come around.

19:23.923 --> 19:26.291
I... I... I watched him leave when
I was out back having a smoke.

19:26.326 --> 19:27.791
He parked the van a block away.

19:27.826 --> 19:29.231
This is the same van

19:29.265 --> 19:30.839
that was parked outside
Lexie's apartment.

19:30.873 --> 19:32.030
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

19:32.065 --> 19:34.233
I... I saw the guy get out
and walk toward Lexie's door.

19:34.267 --> 19:35.400
And you did nothing?

19:35.435 --> 19:37.569
- Wait!
- Nothing?

19:43.243 --> 19:44.877
For all I know,
she had a date with the man!

19:44.911 --> 19:46.842
I thought she was working OT!

19:46.876 --> 19:49.081
What did he look like?

19:49.115 --> 19:50.246
What did he look like?

19:50.280 --> 19:53.085
White dude... white dude,
bald, in... in his 30s.

19:53.119 --> 19:55.454
He was... he was wearing a green jacket.

19:55.488 --> 19:57.422
Hey, listen to me.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.791
Did you see a license plate?

19:59.826 --> 20:01.927
Any... any suspicious customers,

20:01.961 --> 20:03.927
we... we take down their plates.

20:03.961 --> 20:06.164
My bouncer has it somewhere.

20:08.635 --> 20:10.324
Well, let's go get it.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.907
Hank.

20:14.941 --> 20:17.109
I've been trying to track down
Detective Hernandez.

20:17.143 --> 20:18.644
One thing is for damn sure.

20:18.678 --> 20:21.780
He is not out of town on
some witness protection detail.

20:21.814 --> 20:23.115
How do you know that?

20:23.149 --> 20:24.416
I went over to his area.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.785
The A&A sheets show he's on duty in town.

20:26.819 --> 20:28.153
No one knows where exactly.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.756
He's hiding. Means he knows something.

20:30.790 --> 20:32.758
I need you to find this guy, Trudy.

20:32.792 --> 20:34.493
Where does he eat, sleep, drink?

20:34.527 --> 20:35.734
You got it.

20:40.133 --> 20:43.468
I don't usually come here at lunch.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.537
Try to avoid that.

20:45.572 --> 20:48.307
Hey, Leo. Can you give us a minute?

20:48.341 --> 20:49.707
Sure.

20:50.843 --> 20:52.945
Hank, sorry I didn't call you back.

20:52.979 --> 20:55.514
That's all right. I know you're busy.

20:55.548 --> 20:56.949
See, I just want to talk about

20:56.983 --> 20:58.717
some homicides you worked a while back.

20:58.751 --> 20:59.985
You know the strippers?

21:00.019 --> 21:03.322
Hank, I can't, please.

21:03.356 --> 21:05.831
Whatever you tell me stays here,

21:06.593 --> 21:08.393
but I need to find this prick.

21:08.428 --> 21:10.529
He took another woman, a friend of mine.

21:10.563 --> 21:12.030
She's been missing eight hours.

21:12.065 --> 21:14.333
That means I still have time
to find her, but not much.

21:14.367 --> 21:15.534
You understand what I'm saying?

21:15.568 --> 21:18.052
I do, but...

21:18.838 --> 21:20.205
I'm in a corner here.

21:20.239 --> 21:24.209
Leo, you know who I am.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.084
You don't want to go to war with me.

21:35.221 --> 21:37.389
We never got a chance
to truly work the cases,

21:37.423 --> 21:38.590
so I don't know too much.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.158
Okay, why is that?

21:40.193 --> 21:41.693
Kelton shut it down.

21:41.728 --> 21:43.161
He was up for promotion,

21:43.196 --> 21:45.097
needed to keep his violent
crime stats low,

21:45.131 --> 21:47.899
and a confirmed serial killer
wouldn't exactly help him...

21:47.934 --> 21:50.669
Leo, Leo, I don't care about any of that.

21:50.703 --> 21:52.070
I just need information.

21:52.105 --> 21:54.039
Was there a person of interest
you were looking at?

21:54.073 --> 21:57.509
No, I contacted the FBI,
but Kelton stepped in,

21:57.543 --> 21:59.277
told the FBI to back off.

21:59.312 --> 22:01.380
They still delivered us a profile though.

22:01.414 --> 22:02.914
It should be in the case file.

22:02.949 --> 22:04.365
It's not.

22:05.084 --> 22:07.552
How did you find out
we confirmed a serial killer?

22:07.587 --> 22:08.954
You get that from Detective Upton?

22:08.988 --> 22:10.789
No, I knew before she did.

22:10.823 --> 22:13.291
And you called Kelton
to give him a heads-up.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.694
Yeah.

22:15.728 --> 22:17.550
I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry.

22:17.584 --> 22:19.564
Son of a bitch.

22:20.233 --> 22:23.335
You pulled everything
that could bury him.

22:29.095 --> 22:30.868
Superintendent, I need a word.

22:30.902 --> 22:31.997
You got an update?

22:32.337 --> 22:35.037
No, unfortunately
I'm trying to get my hands on

22:35.062 --> 22:37.764
an FBI profile that
was prepared a while back

22:37.798 --> 22:40.199
when the girls were murdered.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.836
Look, I don't care why you took it.

22:43.871 --> 22:46.839
I don't care why you buried
the investigation.

22:46.874 --> 22:48.374
I just want to find my friend.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.510
I don't know what
you're talking about, Hank.

22:50.544 --> 22:51.911
I spoke to the review officer.

22:51.945 --> 22:55.915
He said you checked
all homicides from 2016.

22:55.949 --> 22:58.251
We both know what you were looking for.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.613
Brian...

23:02.289 --> 23:05.858
As we speak, there is a man
torturing and raping my friend.

23:05.893 --> 23:08.795
If I'm lucky, I got about
14 hours left to find her,

23:08.829 --> 23:10.229
to find him.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.542
I understand, Sergeant, I do.

23:14.068 --> 23:17.116
But I am not aware of any
FBI profile; I'm real sorry.

23:18.331 --> 23:19.590
I got to go.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.874
What?

23:21.909 --> 23:23.409
Tags came back on the blue van.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.311
It was stolen from a mall
in Winnetka two months ago.

23:25.345 --> 23:29.082
NVLS caught the van parked
two times at 2132 Lawrence Ave.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.651
- When was this?
<i>- Last two days.</i>

23:36.176 --> 23:39.545
Got a witness saw the blue
van pull out of a loading dock.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.261
I checked the records; this
place has been empty for years.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.997
Up for sale by a company in Gary.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.227
Okay, we got a lot of ground to cover.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.937
We move fast and quiet.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.505
Stay in the shadows.

23:52.539 --> 23:55.007
We sneak up on him,
not the other way around.

23:55.042 --> 23:58.444
Kim, Jay, take the back.
Antonio, you and me.

24:08.288 --> 24:09.822
It's fresh.

24:10.958 --> 24:12.458
We know he keeps them in the cellars.

24:15.362 --> 24:17.330
We found blood near the basement.

24:17.364 --> 24:18.498
We're going down.

24:18.532 --> 24:19.657
<i>Copy.</i>

25:11.351 --> 25:13.853
What the...

25:35.409 --> 25:36.681
My God.

25:42.716 --> 25:44.617
Is this Lexie's coat?

25:51.225 --> 25:52.761
Sarge, we got a body.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.604
Sarge.

26:22.689 --> 26:25.057
Chicago PD! Get on your knees!

26:25.092 --> 26:26.392
Get those hands up high!

26:26.426 --> 26:28.564
- I'm... I'm... I'm with Illinois Power.
- Shut up!

26:28.599 --> 26:30.497
I'm just looking for one of my workers.

26:30.532 --> 26:32.732
- He's not armed.
- Get down!

26:32.766 --> 26:35.501
You move, you die.

26:47.614 --> 26:49.152
It's not Lexie.

26:56.650 --> 26:58.791
Sarge, his name is Roy Calison.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.459
He's married, father of three.

27:00.494 --> 27:03.162
He was inspecting lines down
here for a possible renovation.

27:03.196 --> 27:04.797
He must have crossed with the offender.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.300
Supervisor hadn't heard
from him, so he came to check.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.768
Supervisor see anything?

27:08.802 --> 27:10.536
No, he got here
about the same time as us.

27:10.570 --> 27:12.638
All right, let's check PODs
in the neighborhood.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.553
This guy's been using
this place for years.

27:14.588 --> 27:15.875
There's got to be witnesses.

27:15.909 --> 27:17.094
Sergeant Voight.

27:17.811 --> 27:19.445
You need to see this.

27:22.049 --> 27:23.458
Fuentes.

27:25.986 --> 27:28.601
There's at least four sets
of human skeletal remains,

27:28.635 --> 27:29.689
all female.

27:29.723 --> 27:31.957
Decomp pattern suggests
they've been here for years.

27:31.992 --> 27:33.326
Any read on cause of death?

27:33.360 --> 27:34.660
Difficult to say, but these look like

27:34.695 --> 27:36.462
sharp puncture wounds on that clavicle.

27:36.496 --> 27:38.331
- They were stabbed.
- I'd say so.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.966
All their clothes have multiple
punctures in the fabric,

27:41.001 --> 27:42.686
same sharp instrument.

27:43.337 --> 27:45.671
I need these bodies
worked fast for trace DNA

27:45.706 --> 27:47.807
and I want every inch
of this building searched.

27:47.841 --> 27:49.342
Bring in cadaver dogs.

27:52.846 --> 27:55.681
Sarge, Lexie's got
to still be alive, right?

27:55.716 --> 27:58.084
There's no way the offender
left here with a dead body.

27:58.118 --> 27:59.218
That makes no sense.

27:59.252 --> 28:00.653
Hey. I just heard from Patrol

28:00.687 --> 28:02.555
they found the blue van parked
a mile from here.

28:02.589 --> 28:04.690
- Tell me they didn't move in.
- No, they're waiting for us.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.659
Kim's right. Lexie left here alive.

28:06.693 --> 28:08.561
That's how we're gonna find her.

28:19.039 --> 28:22.108
Chicago PD, step away from the van.

28:31.651 --> 28:34.186
All right, turn it off,
roll the crime lab.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.790
5021 squad, roll
the crime lab to our location.

28:38.283 --> 28:40.192
<i>Copy that.</i>

28:52.239 --> 28:54.073
This is Lexie's.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.374
How do you know?

28:55.409 --> 28:58.144
'Cause I gave it to her. St. Francis.

28:58.178 --> 29:00.197
Patron saint of gratitude.

29:01.181 --> 29:02.448
Yeah, a couple of years ago,

29:02.482 --> 29:03.816
Lexie was helping me make a bust.

29:03.850 --> 29:06.228
Some punk came up on me with a Glock.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.789
Lexie screamed "gun," saved my life.

29:14.995 --> 29:18.063
All right, we know this guy...
he left here on foot

29:18.098 --> 29:20.132
'cause no cab is gonna play around here.

29:20.167 --> 29:21.850
So where's the nearest "L" station?

29:21.885 --> 29:23.402
Orange line, 18th street stop.

29:23.437 --> 29:24.904
It's, like, a couple of blocks away.

29:24.938 --> 29:26.305
Nearest bus is a lot further.

29:26.339 --> 29:27.807
All right, so loop in mass transit.

29:27.841 --> 29:30.509
Let's look at every piece
of CTA security footage

29:30.544 --> 29:32.745
within a five mile radius.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.456
Hmm, stop.

29:35.490 --> 29:37.183
Right there, that guy.

29:37.217 --> 29:39.652
Green jacket, bald. Zoom in.

29:39.686 --> 29:42.755
Okay, the time stamp is
consistent with our timeline.

29:42.789 --> 29:44.801
That's 45 minutes
before we found the van.

29:44.836 --> 29:47.760
- Okay, rewind.
- Yeah.

29:47.794 --> 29:49.371
That's our killer.

29:49.796 --> 29:51.931
Hang on, back it up to when he entered.

29:51.965 --> 29:52.998
Yeah.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.346
He's using a Ventra card.

29:57.381 --> 29:59.299
Right, and if he's using
a credit card to pay for it,

29:59.334 --> 30:01.450
we got this son of a bitch.
Send a print out upstairs.

30:05.615 --> 30:07.281
Sarge, got it?

30:07.915 --> 30:10.383
This is Steven Sawyer's DMV.

30:10.417 --> 30:11.717
He's the guy from the L station

30:11.752 --> 30:12.818
who used the Ventra card.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.353
Same height, weight, build.

30:14.388 --> 30:16.222
We did a photo array with Keith Stinson.

30:16.256 --> 30:18.324
He ID'd him as the creepy guy
from the club.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.223
- That's our guy, Sarge.
- Okay, we got eyes on him?

30:21.257 --> 30:23.481
Not yet. I put in
a covert call to his workplace.

30:23.506 --> 30:24.839
They said he's out of the office all day

30:24.874 --> 30:26.407
and I called his cell provider.

30:26.442 --> 30:27.795
They said they're gonna have
his phone up within the hour

30:27.830 --> 30:28.838
for an emergency ping.

30:28.838 --> 30:29.938
What do we know about him?

30:29.972 --> 30:31.273
A divorced commercial realtor

30:31.307 --> 30:32.974
with a nice crib in Glenview, no sheet.

30:33.009 --> 30:34.776
He moved to Pittsburgh about
three years ago

30:34.810 --> 30:35.944
right when the killings stopped.

30:35.978 --> 30:37.545
Oh, let me guess, he moved back.

30:37.580 --> 30:38.814
About three months ago.

30:39.682 --> 30:40.924
Hit his house, Sarge.

30:40.959 --> 30:43.285
No, not until we figure out
where he's hiding Lexie.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.053
He gets spooked, he might kill her.

30:45.379 --> 30:47.122
We got a BOLO lodged for his Mercedes

30:47.156 --> 30:48.923
with a directive to contact Intelligence

30:48.958 --> 30:50.691
immediately on sight, no police action.

30:50.726 --> 30:51.956
Guys, we got a hit.

30:51.991 --> 30:53.628
Downtown on Erie,
somewhere near the river.

30:53.663 --> 30:55.897
All right, Burgess, Atwater,
you sit on his house.

30:55.931 --> 30:57.799
We'll hit the address.

31:00.836 --> 31:02.504
This guy is just in here sipping wine.

31:02.538 --> 31:04.172
You got to be kidding me.

31:04.206 --> 31:05.807
I say we make him choke on it, boss.

31:05.841 --> 31:07.309
I know you don't want
to spook him or anything,

31:07.343 --> 31:09.110
but maybe we just go in there
and give him a talking to

31:09.145 --> 31:10.852
and get this thing done right now.

31:10.856 --> 31:12.318
No.

31:12.343 --> 31:13.798
We stay patient,

31:13.823 --> 31:16.602
put the tracker on the car,
and follow him to Lexie.

31:16.686 --> 31:18.453
Hailey, do your thing.

31:23.793 --> 31:25.657
Son of a bitch. We lost the eye.

31:32.868 --> 31:34.302
Hailey, get out of there right now.

31:40.676 --> 31:43.044
Excuse me, miss?

31:43.079 --> 31:44.135
Yeah?

31:44.980 --> 31:46.514
<i>Do you live around here?</i>

31:46.549 --> 31:48.717
<i>No, I'm just meeting
some friends for dinner.</i>

31:48.751 --> 31:50.018
Ah.

31:50.052 --> 31:51.820
I'm a little turned around.

31:51.854 --> 31:53.488
Do you know the best way
to get on the Eisenhower?

31:53.522 --> 31:55.814
On ramp is at the end of this street.

31:56.525 --> 31:57.826
Thanks.

31:58.483 --> 31:59.959
You're welcome.

32:12.942 --> 32:15.176
All right, listen up. Tracker is a no go.

32:15.211 --> 32:17.679
We're gonna follow him
old school with the long eye

32:17.713 --> 32:19.013
but we parallel.

32:19.048 --> 32:20.648
I don't want to heat him up.

32:32.695 --> 32:35.397
- You think he made me?
- One way to find out.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.197
I got Hailey. We'll hold the tail
and stay parallel to the West.

32:46.308 --> 32:49.411
We got eyes on Sawyer. He just pulled up.

32:50.946 --> 32:52.914
He's getting out of his car.
Nobody drive by.

33:04.226 --> 33:06.551
He's walking into a five-story building.

33:07.563 --> 33:11.633
<i>Address is 4511 Elston.</i>

33:11.667 --> 33:15.637
Copy. Everybody stand fast.
Wait for my order.

33:15.671 --> 33:20.074
5021 squad, I need you to run
an address for ownership.

33:20.109 --> 33:22.744
4511 Elston Avenue.

33:22.778 --> 33:25.079
<i>5021, we show it being owned
by Luna Shipping.</i>

33:25.114 --> 33:26.714
<i>There's no active licenses</i>

33:26.749 --> 33:28.450
<i>and the building's been up
for sale for a year.</i>

33:28.484 --> 33:31.419
Copy. Jay, what's your exact position?

33:31.454 --> 33:33.922
In the lot, southeast,
at his four o'clock.

33:33.956 --> 33:35.223
<i>Opposite side of you.</i>

33:35.257 --> 33:36.724
All right, I'm sending Adam your way.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.129
I need you to get inside
the building unnoticed,

33:41.163 --> 33:43.131
try to get eyes on Lexie.

33:43.165 --> 33:44.740
Copy that, Sarge.

33:47.837 --> 33:50.605
Wait, hold up, hold up. Stand down.

33:50.639 --> 33:52.440
Homicide's on the scene.

33:53.943 --> 33:56.144
Donahue, what the hell
are you doing here?

33:56.178 --> 33:57.946
Following orders.
Just came from the station.

33:57.980 --> 33:59.113
<i>What's the play, boss?</i>

33:59.148 --> 34:00.748
We're burned. Let's take him.

34:00.783 --> 34:02.784
You stay on the perimeter.

34:02.818 --> 34:04.452
I need this son of a bitch alive.

34:04.487 --> 34:06.171
All right, you got it.

34:24.206 --> 34:27.442
Do not move. It's over.

34:27.476 --> 34:28.676
Get your hands up.

34:28.710 --> 34:30.844
Hey. Okay, easy.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.980
Where's Lexie?

34:32.014 --> 34:33.614
Who's Lexie?

34:33.649 --> 34:35.350
On your knees now!

34:35.384 --> 34:36.951
If you shoot me, you'll never find her.

34:36.985 --> 34:38.953
Get on your knee...

34:40.188 --> 34:42.056
He's heading south. Do not...

34:42.091 --> 34:43.157
No!

34:43.192 --> 34:45.360
Freeze, police!

34:48.831 --> 34:50.255
Where's Lexie?

34:52.868 --> 34:54.502
Where is she?

34:54.536 --> 34:56.538
Where's Lexie?

34:56.572 --> 34:57.954
Where is she?

34:58.741 --> 35:00.749
Where is she?

35:10.369 --> 35:12.069
Patrol and K-9 already swept
the whole place.

35:12.103 --> 35:13.189
There's no sign of her.

35:13.224 --> 35:14.887
I called Sawyer's office.
They manage the building.

35:14.921 --> 35:16.514
He was actually working here legit.

35:16.515 --> 35:19.647
Hey, hey, I told you to hold
the perimeter.

35:19.681 --> 35:21.215
We all knew he was inside.

35:21.249 --> 35:23.183
- But I said stand down.
- He went for a gun.

35:23.218 --> 35:24.618
I told you do not shoot!

35:24.652 --> 35:26.053
And you don't tell me when to shoot.

35:26.087 --> 35:28.122
Sarge. Come on. We still got options.

35:28.156 --> 35:30.057
- Nobody's giving up.
- You're damn right we're not!

35:30.091 --> 35:32.326
Boss, I tried to go through
Sawyer's phone but it's locked.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.799
We found a nine
in his front right pocket.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.743
Now it's the same caliber of the gun

35:36.777 --> 35:38.423
used to kill the power company man.

35:38.457 --> 35:40.100
He had these maintenance keys on him.

35:49.924 --> 35:52.116
Wait, Sawyer abandoned his van.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.249
That means he probably used
his own car to move Lexie.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.256
Have the Techs run the GPS
on his vehicle,

35:58.281 --> 35:59.915
find out where it's been.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.785
I want everyone on the street
standing by!

36:02.819 --> 36:04.286
Let's move.

36:35.452 --> 36:37.002
Lexie!

36:40.257 --> 36:41.390
Lexie!

36:44.694 --> 36:46.095
Police!

36:48.810 --> 36:50.111
In here!

36:50.300 --> 36:51.667
Lexie!

36:51.701 --> 36:53.469
All right, Sarge,
we got these keys we found...

36:53.503 --> 36:54.862
Back off!

37:02.212 --> 37:04.413
Oh, God.

37:12.622 --> 37:15.024
No pulse but she's warm.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.761
5021 Henry, emergency,

37:18.795 --> 37:21.597
we need an ambulance
to 950 West 74th Street.

37:21.631 --> 37:23.666
Got a nonresponsive female victim.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.035
<i>- Copy that, 5021.
- Come on, Lexie.</i>

37:29.072 --> 37:31.307
Come on.

37:57.701 --> 37:59.501
We did everything we could.

38:05.875 --> 38:08.577
I'll call her mother in Ohio.

38:08.612 --> 38:11.146
Let's reach out to all
the other girls' families.

38:12.749 --> 38:15.109
Least we can do
is give them some closure.

38:15.952 --> 38:17.132
Of course.

38:24.628 --> 38:26.512
None of this is on you, Sarge.

38:27.530 --> 38:29.431
Yeah, you're right.

38:31.735 --> 38:33.702
What the hell were you doing
at that warehouse?

38:33.737 --> 38:34.870
Hey, easy, Hank.

38:34.904 --> 38:36.171
We caught chatter on the radio

38:36.206 --> 38:37.606
when the offender's car was found.

38:37.641 --> 38:38.907
So you come in hot?

38:38.942 --> 38:41.052
Blow our one chance to find Lexie alive?

38:41.087 --> 38:42.011
Slow down, Voight.

38:42.045 --> 38:43.946
We're working off orders
from the superintendent.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.415
- To shoot?
- The offender went for a gun.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.883
His gun was in his pocket!

38:47.917 --> 38:48.934
He made an assertive move.

38:48.968 --> 38:50.687
We lost an hour trying
to find this place.

38:50.722 --> 38:52.554
Hey, listen, he went
for his gun, all right?

38:52.589 --> 38:54.923
I'm done apologizing to you.
You understand me?

38:54.958 --> 38:58.260
Sarge, no! Sarge! Sarge, stop!

38:59.996 --> 39:02.631
Tell your friend Kelton
I'm coming for him next.

39:02.666 --> 39:04.175
Get off!

39:05.135 --> 39:06.552
Get off of me!

39:13.576 --> 39:15.878
Had a feeling I'd find you here.

39:15.912 --> 39:18.631
You must really like the coffee.

39:21.518 --> 39:23.218
I touched base with the detective

39:23.253 --> 39:26.097
who originally worked
the stripper murders.

39:26.856 --> 39:30.435
Back then, he suspected
a serial killer was involved.

39:30.927 --> 39:33.771
But to keep his district's stats low,

39:34.664 --> 39:37.650
his commander ordered him to walk away.

39:40.603 --> 39:42.905
Do I know this commander's name?

39:44.107 --> 39:45.158
Yeah.

39:46.543 --> 39:48.243
Kelton.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.487
There's a copy of an email

39:58.521 --> 40:01.256
Kelton sent to Hernandez in 2016.

40:02.359 --> 40:05.160
And it proves that Kelton
backed off one of the worst

40:05.195 --> 40:08.464
serial killers in Chicago
history to get promoted.

40:14.003 --> 40:16.485
A lot of women's lives
could've been saved.

40:21.911 --> 40:24.843
I thought you didn't want
to get involved in politics.

40:31.588 --> 40:33.789
You do with that what you want.

40:34.758 --> 40:36.959
Welcome to the fight, Hank.
