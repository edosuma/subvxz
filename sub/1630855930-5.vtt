Karl Weissman?

Hadassa's boy?

02:11.480 --> 02:15.720
I saw your mother,
not long before she died.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.640
We spoke about you.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.000
Not even you could squeeze
a sermon out of this, eh?

02:30.960 --> 02:32.720
And if Hitler's lot get their way,

02:33.520 --> 02:36.280
soon enough, you won't have
any of us left to preach to…

02:36.840 --> 02:37.760
[chuckles dryly]

02:37.840 --> 02:38.680
…pray for.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.920
I treat people the way they treat me.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.920
I made my peace with that.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.160
Jewish child.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.080
Esther.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.320
She's dead 'cause of me.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.480
-By your hand?
-No.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.200
[sniffles] But by my choices.

[stifling sobs]

03:21.840 --> 03:22.800
Rabbi…

03:24.480 --> 03:27.640
can a man like me
find mercy in God's eyes?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.960
It is not His mercy you should seek.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.560
But the child's.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.960

In here!

[Hasan softly] No, no!

04:36.640 --> 04:38.280
-What happened?
-[exhales]

04:38.880 --> 04:40.120
-Are you okay?
-No.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.160
[Barber] We swept the house.
There's nothing there.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.480
No records, no jars, no bodies. Nothing.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.040
And Andrew Morley?

04:52.120 --> 04:54.720
No Andrew Morley either.
We're looking for him, but…

[sighs]

05:00.360 --> 05:03.400
Look, I don't know what's going on,
but I'm drawing a line under it.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.080
You know there's more to it.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.200
Don't do this.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.640
You've fallen down
a rabbit hole here, Shahara.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.480
I can't follow you.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.240
I'm sorry.

-[Maggie] Shaz?

05:41.120 --> 05:44.480
Look… Barber's told us to leave you be,

05:44.560 --> 05:48.040
but… this is crazy, and I've got to know.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.200
Those prints that you gave me,
are they really from 1890?

05:52.840 --> 05:54.000
Yeah. Why?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.040
Right, 'cause…

05:59.520 --> 06:00.960
I-- I got the results.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.960
And they're 100% match with…

06:06.040 --> 06:06.920
Shaz,

06:07.840 --> 06:09.560
they're Elias Mannix's prints.

Look,

06:55.200 --> 06:56.640
I'm sorry I lied to you.

06:57.960 --> 06:58.800
Trust me.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.440
Once you know the truth,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.880
you'll know why I'm doing this.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.520
Why Chapel Perilous are doing this.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.520
What truth?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.080
You'll be told soon enough.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.400
By who?

07:18.080 --> 07:18.920
We're here.

-[grunts] Hey!
-[tense music playing]

08:37.320 --> 08:38.440
[Defoe] I'm so sorry, Iris.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.920
[Lorna] Your girlfriend better be
bloody worth it, Defoe.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
-[Defoe] Shut up, Lorna.
-[Maplewood] I can hear you.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.680
[woman] Iris Maplewood.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.040
[ominous music playing]

08:51.760 --> 08:52.840
Take her hood off.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.760

[Hasan] Gosh.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.800
Elias, who did that to you?

09:41.360 --> 09:44.360
Governor's going to get me transferred
to Feltham this afternoon.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.680
Apparently, all the screws there
practice mindfulness.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.040
[scoffs]

09:54.200 --> 09:56.280
You've found something out, haven't you?

09:59.400 --> 10:00.280
Something weird.

10:03.880 --> 10:04.880
It's lonely, innit?

10:08.720 --> 10:11.360
Try me. Sharing's caring.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.520
These are from our archives.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.200
[ominous music playing]

10:20.280 --> 10:24.880
This man is called Sir Julian Harker.
That was taken in 1890.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.960
Have you heard of him?

10:27.680 --> 10:29.600
The Morleys ever mention him or…

10:32.280 --> 10:34.480
He died in 1941.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.320
He was 99 years old.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.160
He was killed in his own home,

10:41.040 --> 10:42.000
his own bedroom.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.000
A cop shot him.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.760
Nothing ringing any bells?

10:49.840 --> 10:51.840
Never heard of him. Why?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.400
What's he got to do with anything?

10:57.960 --> 11:01.440
These… are Harker's fingerprints.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.320
Mm?

11:04.840 --> 11:05.800
And these…

11:07.800 --> 11:09.200
are your fingerprints.

11:12.120 --> 11:12.960
Elias,

11:14.240 --> 11:15.640
they're identical.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.680
[dramatic music playing]

11:25.680 --> 11:28.280
[Hillinghead] The first finger markings
were taken from the gaslight

11:28.360 --> 11:29.440
on Longharvest Lane.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.120
The second are Sir Julian Harker's own.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.680
It's proof he was there.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.200
And how did you get this?

11:42.720 --> 11:46.360
It's an… oversight, sir,
on Harker's behalf.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.120
[smacks lips]

11:48.200 --> 11:52.880
Dactylography is a continental fad.
It's hardly evidence.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.080
[inhales sharply] I don't know
what this is even supposed to prove.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.120
[tense music playing]

12:05.840 --> 12:07.160
But I think you do, sir.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.960
-Your insolence is--
-Sir Julian Harker

12:11.040 --> 12:14.920
was at the scene of the Longharvest murder
and he will be questioned formally,

12:15.000 --> 12:15.960
with due diligence.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.080
Here, now!

12:22.840 --> 12:26.760
Your ignorance of the matter
is quite breathtaking to behold.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.200
Get him in.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.880
Can you think of any link
you might have had to Harker?

12:40.880 --> 12:42.440
Your birth parents? Your dad?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.640
-Never knew my dad.
-What about your birth mom?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.240
Do you know where she is?

12:54.800 --> 12:57.360
Morleys said
that she'd probably OD'd by now.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.560
"Probably"?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.320
What does she matter?

13:01.400 --> 13:05.600
That dead body, the Morleys,
they are all linked to this man.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.320
So I need to know
how you're linked to him.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.600
Why your prints match up to his.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.440
And if you don't know… maybe she does.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.200
Her name is Sarah.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.040
Is she a Mannix?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.680
[mysterious music playing]

13:22.640 --> 13:25.000
I remember the creeps
that she hung around with.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.960
The track marks on her arm.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.200
That's it.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.080
If she isn't dead…

13:46.720 --> 13:48.400
whatever state she's in…

13:52.040 --> 13:54.200
I don't want her
to know anything about me.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.200
Okay?

13:59.680 --> 14:04.280
Mags, I need you to get me the address
of every Sarah Mannix in the country.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.040
Focus on the ones with a rap sheet.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.320

-[gun cocks]

14:17.400 --> 14:18.560
[ominous music playing]

14:18.640 --> 14:19.760
[Whiteman] No, don't move.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.400
Don't make a sound.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.960
Funnily enough, that was my intention
before you put a gun to my head.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.680
[glass clinks on table]

14:31.520 --> 14:34.440
Police officer was found dead
on the same tube platform

14:34.520 --> 14:35.880
as that girl in the morgue.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.920
That was your handiwork, wasn't it?

14:40.680 --> 14:41.520
And what about her?

14:42.600 --> 14:43.840
No, I didn't kill her.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.200
[grunts] Listen, please.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.840
I need your help.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.960
[gentle music playing]

14:59.000 --> 14:59.840
[grunts]

15:04.280 --> 15:06.880
The body in the boot… you killed him?

15:06.960 --> 15:07.880
No.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.720
Well, who did? Cozens?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.360
I killed Cozens.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.920
Framed him to get the case closed.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.560
I never killed a man before.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.240
I had gambling debts,

15:24.320 --> 15:27.000
so I did small jobs, middleman stuff.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.840
A voice on the phone
told me what to do, and I did it.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.080
And she said I had to kill Esther.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.080
I couldn't.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.440
So she did it herself.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.640
What are you after?

15:57.480 --> 15:58.320
Hmm?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.440
Vengeance?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.080
Retribution?

16:04.080 --> 16:04.920
[grunts]

16:06.520 --> 16:07.560
Justice.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.840
Justice for Esther.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.000
People here think
you're a walk in the park.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.680
But I know it's no small thing
to keep your nose clean,

16:18.760 --> 16:19.920
especially around here.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.080
This woman,

16:24.200 --> 16:25.440
I don't know who she is,

16:26.240 --> 16:29.000
but she's part of something,
something bigger.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.000
And I'm not the only one on her books.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.640
How did she know Esther was here?
Someone talked.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.600
Someone here.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.280
In our department.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.960
There's never just the one rat, Calloway.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.120
[suspenseful music playing]

16:44.200 --> 16:45.280
They're right here.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.480
Listening.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.000
Watching.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.080
Hiding.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.040
Help me flush 'em out.
Find out what's really going on.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.280
[music continues]

17:33.000 --> 17:34.120
[Hasan] Sarah Mannix?

17:35.120 --> 17:35.960
Yeah?

17:36.040 --> 17:40.120
My name's DS Shahara Hasan.
I'm here to talk about your son, Elias.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.360
He's in some trouble, Sarah.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.240
Look, he-- he doesn't want
anything to do with me.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.280
He's in prison.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.280
For murder.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.200
[Sarah exhales]

17:57.280 --> 17:58.240
[music fades]

18:06.880 --> 18:08.240
The social took him away.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.760
When he were four.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.040
[clicks tongue]

18:14.120 --> 18:15.960
I remember how he looked at me.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.520
This…

18:19.680 --> 18:20.520
pale…

18:22.040 --> 18:24.040
little kid in the back of the car,

18:24.960 --> 18:27.720
watching his mom
sign him off to foster care.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.680
[exhales]

18:29.760 --> 18:30.600
[inhales]

18:32.600 --> 18:34.400
He never took his eyes off me.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.680
And I just shut the door.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.600
He was safer away from me,
even I knew that.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.960
I tried.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.360
To see him again.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.600
And they said
Elias wanted nothing to do with me.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.680
[sputters] The Morleys,

18:56.920 --> 18:57.760
I mean.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.480
I can't blame him for that.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.760
[Sarah breathes shakily]

19:08.280 --> 19:09.320
You want to see him?

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
[tense music playing]

19:13.640 --> 19:14.560
What's he like?

19:16.840 --> 19:17.680
Bright.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.120
And alone.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.800
[dramatic synth music playing]

19:32.400 --> 19:33.280
[music fades]

19:33.360 --> 19:35.400
They'll find me, you know?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.000
Then kill you.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.120
So, whatever you're gonna do,

19:41.920 --> 19:43.000
get it over with.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.080
I'm not talking.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.000
We don't torture, Constable.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.720
We educate.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.920
[tense music playing]

19:53.560 --> 19:54.920
[Hasan grunts]

19:57.200 --> 19:58.680
-[grunts]
-[groans]

19:58.760 --> 19:59.600
[Lorna] Hasan!

20:00.400 --> 20:03.400
Try me again,
and I'll rip the tech from your back.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.320
-Fuck you!
-Easy, Hasan.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.120
[huffing, groaning]

20:10.440 --> 20:11.320
Pick her up.

20:14.040 --> 20:14.960
[Maplewood groans]

20:15.760 --> 20:16.600
[grunts]

20:17.080 --> 20:18.800
Nice friends you've got, Defoe.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.400
Okay.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.120
Don't give me that look.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.400
She's with Mannix.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.440
Maybe, but…

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
I trust her.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.680
Well… maybe that's what gets you killed.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.000
[door creaks, closes]

20:46.840 --> 20:49.560
How you respond
to what I'm about to show you

20:49.640 --> 20:53.240
will determine how this does
or doesn't end for you.

21:05.240 --> 21:06.200
[light clunks on]

21:08.600 --> 21:11.400
You're not the first detective
to discover Defoe's body.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.920
You're one of four.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.280
[dramatic music playing]

21:21.040 --> 21:23.920
DI Hillinghead in 1890.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.880
DS Whiteman in 1941.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.360
And me.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.160
DS Hasan.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.760
2023.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.520
You were a cop?

21:38.600 --> 21:42.640
My investigation 30 years ago led me…

21:46.600 --> 21:47.760
to this boy.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.920
Elias Mannix.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.040
He was 15 years old.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.320
You know him.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.440
He'd grow up to be your Commander Mannix.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.040
The government said
they never found who set off the bomb.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.320
They lied because they did it themselves.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.000
It was Elias who detonated the bomb.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.040
I watched him do it.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.960
Time travel is real.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.440
Mannix intends to go back to 1890

22:38.520 --> 22:39.720
and form a cult.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.160
This cult will initiate a chain of events

22:43.240 --> 22:47.160
that will lead to the bomb
that Mannix's younger self will detonate.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.320
Then they'll take power
and build the society we live in today…

22:52.400 --> 22:56.760
[inhales] …a society
where everybody's loved.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.800
We live in Mannix's utopia, his "fix."

23:03.680 --> 23:06.440
Built on the murder
of half a million innocent people.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.200
All he has to do now is go back to 1890

23:11.280 --> 23:14.160
and create that same chain of events.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.240
[music continues]

23:16.680 --> 23:19.120
[Paxman] Sir Julian,
thank you for coming in.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.400
My apologies.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.760
I-- Please.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.560
My office is a little quieter.

23:34.920 --> 23:35.880
[music fades]

23:38.480 --> 23:40.920
The night of the murder,
a photograph was taken

23:41.000 --> 23:45.360
of a figure hiding in an alcove
near where the victim was discovered.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.200
Prints on the gaslight.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.520
Were mine.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.840
I dimmed the gaslight
when I heard someone coming.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.840
There was nowhere else to hide
other than the alcove.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.520
I lost my head a little.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.440
You would too if you'd seen what I'd seen.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.560
-You admit this is you?
-Absolutely.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.200
William, would you mind awfully
bringing us some tea?

24:19.080 --> 24:20.120
Uh, tea?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.080
-I'll send for some.
-No, I'd like you to fetch it.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.280
[door closes]

24:39.000 --> 24:40.240
That'll piss him off.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.320
[mysterious music playing]

24:44.240 --> 24:47.800
I'd tread more carefully
if I were you… Sir Julian.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.560
The fact that you're here
and changing your story

24:52.640 --> 24:54.360
tells me that you're scared.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.480
A brave man stands before me.

25:00.040 --> 25:00.920
For now.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.160
I'm going to tell you everything, Alfred.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.240
The whole truth, nothing but.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.960
It's going to blow your mind.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.360
If you're trying to brainwash me,

25:19.960 --> 25:21.440
you're wasting your time.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.200
-Commander Mannix would never--
-It's the truth.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.320
In 2023, I found a record.

25:31.320 --> 25:36.320
Mannix recorded hundreds of them,
and on one of them, he says your name.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.600
Iris Maplewood.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.360
He said you'd be important.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.280
I've wanted to know why for a long time.

25:50.520 --> 25:54.520
Mannix believes you're a part of this,
whether you know it or not.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.960
So now that you're here, I want
to work out if you're friend or foe.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.120
If you're friend,
you can help us stop Mannix.

26:15.000 --> 26:15.840
This is…

26:21.240 --> 26:25.240
literally the greatest crock of shit
I've ever heard.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.960
[Hasan breathes deeply]

26:28.040 --> 26:29.200
[ominous music playing]

26:29.280 --> 26:30.640
Take her to The Throat.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.320
All right, listen up!

26:41.400 --> 26:43.280
[tense music playing]

26:44.760 --> 26:47.680
We have uncovered new evidence

26:47.760 --> 26:50.840
that suggests Lee Cozens was framed

26:51.760 --> 26:55.480
for the murder of the man discovered
in the boot the night of Farrell's death.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.560
I'm therefore reopening the investigation.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.160
All leads are to be swiftly re-evaluated.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.680
Get to work.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.360
[suspenseful music playing]

27:11.720 --> 27:13.400
Hey, Charlie, what are you doing?

27:13.480 --> 27:14.760
[door closes]

27:14.840 --> 27:16.880
-I've got an urgent.
-You'll have to hold it, June.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.320
-Mrs. Shirley, we ready?
-[Shirley] Ears peeled, girls.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.120
All calls coming
into the station monitored.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.440
And Charlie will listen in
as they come through.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.600
I want to know whose desk each call
is coming from, and who they're phoning.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.600
-[women murmuring]
-[Whiteman] Calloway's orders.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.680
[suspenseful music continues]

27:34.760 --> 27:36.200
[clicks, buzzes]

27:36.800 --> 27:37.920
Call here.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.160
-[Whiteman inserts jack plug]
-Switchboard.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.320
-[Harris] 456-577.
-Putting you through, sir.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.760
Detective Harris to the Coroner's Office.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.640
[Harris] Benny,
I'll need that coroner's report

27:51.720 --> 27:53.840
on the, uh, one-eyed stiff in the boot.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.760
[Benny] Ugh, again?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.960
[Harris] That git's sending us
on a wild goose chase.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.200
[operator] Another call here.

28:01.800 --> 28:02.680
Switchboard.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.760
-[woman] 565-4444.
-[operator] Putting you through.

28:07.840 --> 28:08.680
[clicks]

28:09.240 --> 28:10.560
[whirring]

28:10.640 --> 28:13.080
That's Kathleen Squires.
I don't recognize the number,

28:13.160 --> 28:15.800
but 565 is the Mansion House
telephone exchange.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.480
[man] To whom may I connect your call?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.400
-[Kathleen] Know you are loved.
-[dramatic sting]

28:21.480 --> 28:22.800
[man] Hold the line, please.

28:24.960 --> 28:25.800
[The Woman] Yes?

28:26.800 --> 28:29.120
[Kathleen] Whiteman's told Calloway
that Cozens was framed

28:29.200 --> 28:30.360
for the body in the boot.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.840
Calloway's re-opened the case,
whole department's back on it.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.280
[line hangs up]

28:35.360 --> 28:38.080
-That's it. She's hung up.
-[ominous music playing]

28:42.080 --> 28:43.240
[music continues]

28:44.120 --> 28:45.040
[lighter clicks]

28:54.960 --> 28:56.000
Another coffee, sir?

28:57.040 --> 28:58.840
I wish you'd come to me first, Kathleen.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.400
-Escort Miss Squires to a holding cell.
-[man] Sir.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.320
Oh… No.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.280
I'm sorry, sir.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.880
[grunts] Charlie, please!

29:11.520 --> 29:12.960
She said she'd kill my son.

29:13.040 --> 29:16.560
We'll get your son safe, I promise.
But for Esther's sake, who is she?

29:17.280 --> 29:20.320
All I know is the number goes
to a private switchboard at a bank.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.240
Harker and Co. in the city.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
[suspenseful music intensifies]

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
[siren wailing, rattling]

29:36.160 --> 29:37.360
This isn't the Wild West.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.440
If you see her, I ask the questions,
we go by the book. Understood?

29:40.520 --> 29:41.400
[grunts]

29:47.000 --> 29:49.040
Welcome to Harker Bank, gentlemen.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.880
How may I help you today?

29:51.960 --> 29:55.800
I'm, uh, Detective Inspector Calloway.
This is Detective Sergeant Whiteman.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.240
We'd like to see the manager.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.920
May I ask what it's about?

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
We're after an old bint, cut-glass accent,
who looks like butter wouldn't melt.

30:02.080 --> 30:02.920
You seen her?

30:03.880 --> 30:06.880
[Polly] Well, if the bombs come,
send the girls downstairs to the vault.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.200
Arguably, it'd be safer down there
than anywhere else in London.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.200
[man] Very good.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.560
It's definitely cleaner
than some filthy underground station or…

30:14.640 --> 30:16.240
[ominous music playing]

30:16.320 --> 30:17.320
It's her.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.920
I'm the managing director. How may I help?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.880
We're investigating a series of murders,

30:28.960 --> 30:32.760
and we believe that somebody that works
at this bank's private switchboard

30:32.840 --> 30:33.720
may be involved.

30:34.480 --> 30:35.640
Our switchboard?

30:36.520 --> 30:37.360
Are you sure?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.400
[Calloway] If you'd allow me
to ask a few questions,

30:40.480 --> 30:42.040
we can get the ball rolling.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.680
This way.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.480
[Calloway] I need a cool head, Whiteman.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.080
-Stay put.
-Apologies, sir.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.520
What for?

30:52.560 --> 30:53.680
My right hook.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.200
-[groans]
-[tense piano music playing]

30:56.280 --> 30:57.520
-Everybody down.
-[people scream]

30:57.600 --> 30:59.400
-Move it! Move!
-[whimpers]

31:00.680 --> 31:01.760
[groans]

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
[whimpering]

31:03.920 --> 31:05.280
[Whiteman] We need to talk.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.080
Know you are loved.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.280
[exhales]

31:12.360 --> 31:13.560
[music fades]

31:16.960 --> 31:17.840
[inhales sharply]

31:18.600 --> 31:19.760
[exhales slowly]

31:21.320 --> 31:23.440
I ran away from home when I were 15.

31:24.840 --> 31:28.080
A couple of years later, I meet this boy.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.280
Says his name's Danny.

31:32.000 --> 31:32.920
He were funny.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.400
We got drunk.

31:38.720 --> 31:39.920
Two months later,

31:41.320 --> 31:43.120
it's this thin blue line and…

31:44.480 --> 31:47.440
Everybody said I shouldn't keep it,

31:47.520 --> 31:49.320
that I wouldn't be able
to take care of it,

31:49.400 --> 31:53.560
and I knew that it'd be one thing
in this world that were mine.

31:55.080 --> 31:55.960
You know?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
[smacks lips] So, I…

32:00.000 --> 32:01.160
I tracked Danny down.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.280
[scoffs] Not easy, and, um…

32:05.800 --> 32:06.760
[sniffles]

32:08.760 --> 32:09.840
[remote clatters]

32:09.920 --> 32:10.800
He's rich.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.120
You'd never think it.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.680
Danny's the great-grandson
of some posh dead banker,

32:20.280 --> 32:22.440
and he's running on some trust fund.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.640
When I told him I were pregnant,

32:25.720 --> 32:29.200
suddenly, all I'm talking to
are his lawyers.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.280
And they think I'm after the family pot.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.040
And Danny… disappears.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.080
[Hasan] Thank you.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.160
[Sarah] When he were born…

32:53.160 --> 32:55.120
I couldn't bring myself to look at him.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.840
I was scared.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.040
That he'd look up at me and…

33:04.640 --> 33:05.520
see…

33:06.560 --> 33:09.000
just the shit I had in me.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.080
And he wouldn't know--

33:14.840 --> 33:16.480
he wouldn't know that I loved him.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.440
And I did.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.360
[stifles sob]

33:23.640 --> 33:24.840
More than anything.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.240
[stifling sobs]

33:29.440 --> 33:30.280
[exhales]

33:32.400 --> 33:33.800
-[sniffles]
-Sarah,

33:34.960 --> 33:37.360
that banker you mentioned,

33:38.880 --> 33:40.680
his name is Julian Harker, right?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.400
Yeah. How did you know that?

33:44.040 --> 33:46.520
I have searched the Harker family tree,

33:46.600 --> 33:50.600
and there's no one
called Daniel Harker that I'm aware of.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.000
No, no, Danny wasn't…

33:52.600 --> 33:53.960
He took his mother's name.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.600
Barber.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.680
[eerie music playing]

33:59.400 --> 34:00.240
Barber?

34:05.760 --> 34:07.720
[tapping phone] Tell me this isn't him.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.840
-Mm.
-You're sure?

34:17.840 --> 34:18.680
Yeah.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.640
-[phone ringing]
-Shit.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.560
[ominous music plays]

34:26.240 --> 34:29.000
Hasan, everything okay?
Or was it a butt dial?

34:29.080 --> 34:31.240
[chuckling] Can I still say butt dial?

34:31.320 --> 34:33.720
[chuckles nervously] Yeah.
Something like that.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.320
[tense music playing]

34:38.560 --> 34:39.520
Give Sarah my love.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.200
[ominous music playing]

34:42.720 --> 34:45.400
-[hesitantly] How-- How did you--
-We'll see you soon.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.440
[panting]

34:51.520 --> 34:52.360
[scanner beeps]

34:54.920 --> 34:56.200
[Hasan] Is Barber in his office?

34:56.280 --> 34:59.480
[Maggie] Hi. I'm calling about a prisoner
that should have arrived this afternoon.

34:59.560 --> 35:00.720
His name's Elias Mannix.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.640
[man] We're trying to find out
what's going on with that transfer.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.960
-He should have arrived by now.
-What do you mean?

35:06.040 --> 35:08.080
He was signed out
by Officer Daniel Barber.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.640
-Right.
-But we can't reach him.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.600
Okay, uh, get the governor
to call me right back.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.960
-[sighs]
-Well?

35:13.040 --> 35:14.680
Nobody knows where they are.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.680
Shit!

35:16.160 --> 35:18.040
Hey. Hasan!

35:19.880 --> 35:20.840
[Hasan] Come on!

35:28.200 --> 35:30.520
[strange whooshing and humming]

35:52.440 --> 35:53.960
[crackling]

36:02.920 --> 36:05.040
Still think we're trying to brainwash you?

36:18.440 --> 36:19.280
Defoe!

36:21.200 --> 36:22.680
Time to show and tell.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.240
[tapping at keyboard]

36:28.480 --> 36:30.480
[humming growing louder]

36:33.240 --> 36:34.480
[device thrums]

36:34.560 --> 36:37.440
[whooshing and humming growing louder]

36:51.160 --> 36:52.360
[Defoe] Three years ago,

36:52.440 --> 36:55.080
as part of my research
into the Deutsch particle,

36:55.160 --> 36:58.120
I detected an abnormal neutrino trace.

36:58.800 --> 37:03.680
It defied every natural law
I thought I understood.

37:05.120 --> 37:08.640
All I knew was,
the closer I got to the source,

37:09.640 --> 37:12.320
what you're about to experience
started happening.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.320
[mysterious, disorienting music playing]

37:22.880 --> 37:23.840
Oh my God.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.960
[Defoe] Temporal displacement.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.600
One splits into multiple states of time.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.360
Naturally-occurring time travel.

37:34.440 --> 37:35.800
[humming grows louder]

37:35.880 --> 37:38.720
[sound distorting] There is no science yet
to explain what it is.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.760
Perhaps, we're not ready to understand it.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.160
Pocketful of weird,
110 meters underground.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.920
This is what Mannix wants.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.000
It's time travel, Iris.

37:51.320 --> 37:53.640
He killed all those people.
Mannix lied to you.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.360
He killed all those people.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.360
Tell me when you're going to throw up,
everybody does first time.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.320
[echoing] Tell me
when you're going to throw up…

38:01.880 --> 38:03.000
I'm okay. [retches]

38:03.080 --> 38:05.520
[Defoe's voice echoing]

38:05.600 --> 38:07.600
[sounds become muffled]

38:10.400 --> 38:13.560
[Defoe] Throat is what Mannix uses
to go back to 1890.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.360
That's where the loop begins,

38:15.440 --> 38:18.680
where he creates
the timeline of his own existence.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.160
[Hasan] Each time we've tried
to stop the loop, we've failed.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.360
We can't stop it.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.440
[Maplewood shudders]

38:25.520 --> 38:28.760
[Defoe] We couldn't kill Mannix,
so we tried to destroy The Throat.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.600
We've tried to bury it, obstruct it.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.840
-Nothing seems to work.
-Stop talking, I don't--

38:32.920 --> 38:36.400
The most I can do is drain it,
deplete it, keep it weak.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.640
There's a dark energy field around it.
Whilst that's there, it can't be used.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.760
But it won't last.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.760
He is coming, and he will use it.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.160
We've seen my body die.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.160
[smacks lips]

38:47.240 --> 38:48.640
It's not possible.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.160
It's real, Iris.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.280
[whooshing grows louder]

38:59.840 --> 39:01.200
[whooshing fades]

39:04.720 --> 39:06.720
[indistinct conversations]

39:07.760 --> 39:11.520
If what you say is true,
if it's already happened,

39:12.080 --> 39:13.360
then you've already lost.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.200
You can't stop it.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.320
You'll die.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.160
Mannix will go back.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.560
[liquid pouring]

39:27.280 --> 39:28.160
[scissors snip]

39:32.360 --> 39:34.080
[inhales sharply] Say you succeed.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.680
Then what?

39:38.400 --> 39:41.840
All we want is to save those lives
by stopping the bomb.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.080
What about the people who are alive now?

39:49.280 --> 39:50.360
You don't know.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.000
You don't. [scoffs]

39:58.240 --> 40:02.720
You just want to rip everything up
like every other terrorist.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.920
I'd have my son back.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.240
[gentle music playing]

40:10.400 --> 40:12.200
Please, Iris.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.400
We need you.

40:20.080 --> 40:20.920
[sucks teeth]

40:22.040 --> 40:22.880
[smacks lips]

40:23.600 --> 40:24.840
You've got me wrong.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.640
I'm not your friend.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.680
-[alarms blaring]
-[dramatic music playing]

40:37.760 --> 40:38.840
[gasps]

40:42.400 --> 40:44.080
You led them here? Hasan!

40:44.160 --> 40:45.280
-[gun fires]
-[gasps]

40:49.040 --> 40:52.960
Defoe, we need to get you out of here.
Defoe, move, now!

40:54.640 --> 40:55.520
Tie her up.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.680
[sounds fade]

40:59.520 --> 41:01.520
[muffled police chatter]

41:06.040 --> 41:08.040
[disorienting music playing]

41:09.440 --> 41:10.840
[muffled gunfire]

41:11.880 --> 41:12.880

[device whooshing]

41:31.640 --> 41:34.440
-[device clunks off]
-Don't! Don't. Please. Please.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.640
[shudders]

41:35.720 --> 41:38.240
[officer] We've found her, sir.
Maplewood secured.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.680
[alarm continues blaring]

41:40.880 --> 41:41.840
[alarm clunks off]

41:41.920 --> 41:43.920
[footsteps approaching]

41:44.640 --> 41:46.640
[disorienting music playing]

41:48.160 --> 41:49.160
[Mannix] Detective.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.000
Did they hurt you?

42:01.880 --> 42:02.720
No, Commander.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.480
You did well, Detective.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.000
Show me what you found.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.200
[ominous music playing]

42:22.960 --> 42:24.680
Something on your mind, Detective?

42:26.240 --> 42:27.320
No, Commander.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.520
What did they say?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.640
Paranoid fantasies, sir.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.200
Tell me what they said.

42:36.760 --> 42:37.600
Be specific.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.160
They said…

42:47.960 --> 42:51.200
They said you were the one
who detonated the bomb in '23.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.000
And this Throat thing,

42:55.600 --> 42:56.640
whatever that is…

42:56.720 --> 42:57.680
[shudders]

42:57.760 --> 42:59.080
…was the key to it all.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.840
"Paranoid fantasies…"

43:05.960 --> 43:07.960
[device humming]

43:09.720 --> 43:11.720
[device whooshing]

43:18.360 --> 43:20.360
[disorienting music playing]

43:35.600 --> 43:36.960
[breathing shakily]

43:51.600 --> 43:54.480
[Harker] You want to know
what I was doing on Longharvest Lane?

43:55.280 --> 43:57.680
I was waiting for a miracle.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.960
And that miracle came.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.560
It assured me I was on the right path.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.800
A path that will lead to new worlds.

44:07.880 --> 44:09.200
[spoon clinking on cup]

44:10.160 --> 44:12.040
People wake up every day here.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.520
And the moment they do,
they remember their shackles.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.800
They're prisoners,
and they don't even know it.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.200
You wear your shackles too, Alfred.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.720
Anyone can see it.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.400
[tense music playing faintly]

44:31.480 --> 44:33.400
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.600
When you kneel before your God,

44:40.360 --> 44:44.440
do you feel your lies will be forgiven
if you persecute others for theirs?

44:53.360 --> 44:56.000
I will make it my life's mission

44:56.760 --> 44:58.080
to expose you.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.800
All of you.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.760
And I will not stop

45:06.240 --> 45:09.400
until the truth about you is discovered.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.680
[Harker chuckles]

45:25.760 --> 45:31.560
You… don't quite remember what happened…

45:33.960 --> 45:35.320
at the séance, do you?

45:41.600 --> 45:42.480
What is that?

45:47.520 --> 45:49.800
-[eerie string music playing]
-Your murder confession.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.280
There's plenty more.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.160
A simple mortician's trick,

46:01.800 --> 46:04.840
and a dead man
becomes a policeman's spurned lover.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.400
I have no desire to punish nor expose

46:14.480 --> 46:17.080
the part of you
that most deserves the light.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.160
Your love for Henry

46:21.120 --> 46:22.160
is no crime.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
It's not a sin.

46:26.040 --> 46:28.400
Love is your only weakness.

46:34.040 --> 46:36.560
Frame Henry Ashe
for the Longharvest murder.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.200
Ensure his guilt,

46:40.040 --> 46:43.280
and you and your family
will have a future.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.600
[footsteps approaching]

46:47.440 --> 46:48.880
If you don't,

46:49.920 --> 46:52.160
those photographs will destroy you.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.440
The truth has found its place.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.840
It's a lovely cup of tea.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.760
It's all Paxman's good for.

47:12.840 --> 47:13.960
I didn't kill him.

47:15.240 --> 47:16.320
I don't know who did.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.200
I've never known.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.200
[door closes]

48:37.840 --> 48:41.120
[Polly] You know,
my father was a police officer.

48:42.280 --> 48:45.040
Detective Inspector Alfred Hillinghead.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.600
You remind me of him.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.720
Willfully, blindly stubborn.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.800
Bringing me here to your synagogue.

48:57.880 --> 49:01.960
Looking for answers to questions
your God can't help you with.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.440
So long as He sees through the hole

49:03.520 --> 49:06.000
I'm going to put in your head,
that's fine by me.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.040
You can't kill me. It's not the time.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.440
It's not the time?

49:14.520 --> 49:16.360
[mysterious music playing]

49:16.440 --> 49:18.360
Well, let's test that theory, shall we?

49:20.960 --> 49:22.600
Six chambers, one bullet.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.320
-[cocks gun]
-[whimpers]

49:27.360 --> 49:28.760
Why did Esther have to die?

49:30.160 --> 49:31.520
I feel your grief.

49:32.880 --> 49:35.880
But there's nothing I can answer
that will relieve it.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.200
[clicks]

49:38.680 --> 49:39.560
[exhales]

49:40.400 --> 49:43.440
Since you couldn't go
through with it yourself,

49:44.160 --> 49:45.040
it fell to me.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.120
I was never gonna do it.

49:46.960 --> 49:47.880
Hmm.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.680
You're young. So certain.

49:51.320 --> 49:55.080
I think you came rather closer to it
than you might care to admit.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.000
[clicks]

49:57.080 --> 49:59.280
-[exhales]
-Why was that body so important?

49:59.920 --> 50:02.200
My father asked the same question.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.640
It did nothing good to him.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.840
-[gun clicks]
-[gasps]

50:07.320 --> 50:08.160
Think.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.640
How much do you want?

50:11.440 --> 50:12.360
Fifty-thousand?

50:13.040 --> 50:13.880
A hundred?

50:14.720 --> 50:17.880
Say a number, nothing's impossible.
We could go to the bank now.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.600
-You could-- Wait, just stop!
-[clicks]

50:19.680 --> 50:21.600
You know what happens now, right?

50:21.680 --> 50:23.680
-Is it this chamber or the next?
-[gasps]

50:25.640 --> 50:26.480
I've told you.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.800
We just needed
the murder investigation closed.

50:30.880 --> 50:31.920
Who's we?

50:32.000 --> 50:35.560
[exhales] Uncuff me,
and we can explain everything.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.840
-[gasps] Please! Please!
-She was just a kid!

50:39.120 --> 50:41.320
She would have disappeared,
I'd have made sure.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.480
She didn't need to die.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.320
There was too much to lose.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.760
[inhales, whimpers]

50:45.840 --> 50:48.200
I didn't want to kill her.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.800
[breathes heavily]

50:50.400 --> 50:51.280
Oh, Karl.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.000
-You think I enjoyed it?
-[object rustles]

50:54.560 --> 50:55.440
[gasps]

50:56.480 --> 50:57.840
-We can make you rich.
-[clicks]

50:57.920 --> 50:58.760
[Polly yelps]

50:58.840 --> 51:00.360
[Calloway] Be a cop, Whiteman.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.480
[Polly shuddering]

51:03.960 --> 51:06.880
-I can't let her walk, Calloway.
-[Calloway] I won't let her.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.840
[Polly whimpers]

51:08.920 --> 51:10.280
[Calloway] She's confessed.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.160
I heard every word.

51:18.960 --> 51:22.640
You're under arrest for the murder
of Lee Cozens and DC George Ackroyd.

51:22.720 --> 51:25.640
And you are under arrest
for the murder of Esther Jankovsky.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.040
[Polly exhales]

51:28.040 --> 51:31.080
I'll meet the hangman with a smile
knowing your neck's going to snap

51:31.160 --> 51:32.800
-right after mine.
-[door closes]

51:34.280 --> 51:37.320
Calloway, I told you
not to enter till backup arrived.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.880
-Chief?
-[ominous music playing]

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
Give me the gun.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.280
-Uncuff her, for God's sake.
-[officer] Sir.

51:47.160 --> 51:50.160
She's under arrest for the murder
of an 11-year-old child, sir.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.680
I witnessed her confession.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.120
That's a shame.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.800
-[cocks gun]
-No, wait!

51:55.880 --> 51:56.720
Calloway!

51:56.800 --> 51:58.680
-[dramatic music playing]
-Calloway!

51:58.760 --> 52:00.200
[chief] Know you are loved.

52:03.640 --> 52:04.760
Hello, Mother.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.280
[music fades]

52:20.120 --> 52:21.280
[car horn honks]

52:30.400 --> 52:31.280
Barber?

52:49.280 --> 52:50.120
Barber?

53:05.280 --> 53:07.280
[intriguing music playing]

53:41.080 --> 53:42.200
[crackling]

53:45.320 --> 53:46.640
[Mannix] Hello, Shahara.

53:47.480 --> 53:48.680
It's Elias here.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.280
If memory serves,

53:51.360 --> 53:53.920
you're listening to this
in my father's flat.

53:54.800 --> 53:59.040
I remember your visit to prison
this morning as if it were yesterday.

54:00.800 --> 54:05.880
We are one another's ghosts
of past, present, and future.

54:05.960 --> 54:06.800
[dramatic sting]

54:06.880 --> 54:08.640
It's hard to grasp, isn't it?

54:09.640 --> 54:12.840
But there's one thing I know for certain.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.480
We'll meet again.

54:22.080 --> 54:23.160
[ominous sting]

54:24.400 --> 54:27.360
