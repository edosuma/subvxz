YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.041
YOU'RE WRITING ALREADY?
OLIVER, THE DEAL'S NOT
OFFICIALLY CLOSED YET.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.458
ANDREW'S STILL TALKING
TO THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS
PEOPLE.

00:29.458 --> 00:34.083
THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURE
IF THEY'RE GONNA LET ME
DIRECT IT YET.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.625
I KNOW.
I'M EXCITED, TOO.

GONNA CALL YOU BACK.

AW, MAN,
THIS IS WEIRD.

00:54.792 --> 00:57.041
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?

00:57.041 --> 01:01.125
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
3, 4 YEARS?

01:11.708 --> 01:14.333
BUT THE NUMBER...UH,
SOME GUY ANSWERED.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.542
AND THEN I GOT REALLY BUSY
WITH THE MOVIE,

01:17.542 --> 01:20.625
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,
A YEAR HAD PASSED.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.333
I THOUGHT I MIGHT SEE YOU
AT THE PREMIERE.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.917
I COULDN'T GET OUT.
I WAS WORKING ON MY THESIS.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.583
I SAW IT, THOUGH, TWICE.

SOMETHING?

01:50.542 --> 01:51.208

01:51.208 --> 01:54.083
I THINK ABOUT YOU A LOT,

WHICH IS WEIRD
BECAUSE WE DON'T TALK EVER.

I HAVE TO GO BACK TO L.A.,

IT'S HIGH TIME

06:20.417 --> 06:22.542
FOR ONE OF THOSE GRAND
ROMANTIC GESTURES OF YOURS.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.542
WELL, I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT I THINK I'M FRESH OUT.

HIS GIRLFRIEND,
AND HIS SELF-ESTEEM
IN A MATTER OF WEEKS.

VERB, SENTENCE.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.083
IT'S A PIECE
OF CAKE. WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.041
WELL, MAYBE SHE JUST DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.

07:01.041 --> 07:01.959

SOMETHING TO SAY?

HER FIRST WORD.

07:12.375 --> 07:13.792
YOU HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE
THIS YEAR, DAWSON.

07:13.792 --> 07:16.959

GONNA LET YOU FORGET THAT.

07:18.417 --> 07:20.125

AREN'T I?

07:20.125 --> 07:21.667

07:40.417 --> 07:42.458
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
NOT THAT IT MATTERS.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.208
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO SAY, ANYWAY.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.250
A LEERY WITH NOTHING TO SAY?

07:45.250 --> 07:47.000
I DON'T BUY IT FOR A SECOND.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.417

08:16.000 --> 08:17.458
ARE YOU SURE
YOU REALLY WANNA DO THIS?

08:17.458 --> 08:19.583
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT'S GONNA KEEP ME
OFF THAT PLANE.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.250
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HOLD IT
AGAINST ME IN 10 YEARS.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.834
YOU'RE ASKING IF I'M SURE
I WANNA PASS UP THE OPPORTUNITY

08:24.834 --> 08:27.375
TO SPEND THE SUMMER
WITH A COUPLE OF CHILLY,
DYSFUNCTIONAL W.A.S.P.s

08:27.375 --> 08:29.667
IN FAVOR OF A GRAND ADVENTURE
WITH MY VERY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD?

08:29.667 --> 08:32.457
YEAH. YEAH, THAT.
GET OUT. YOU MAKE ME SICK.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.833
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YA.

08:33.833 --> 08:34.750
OH. GOT THIS
FOR YOU.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.082
MOBY DICK?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.375
YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S A LONG FLIGHT.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.166
I FIGURED YOU'D NEED
SOMETHING TO READ.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.667
BUT I LIKE TO CHAT.
I KNOW, AND I LIKE TO SLEEP,

08:43.667 --> 08:46.041
HENCE THE OVERSIZED
VOLUME YOU NOW
HOLD IN YOUR HANDS.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.500
I'LL SEE YA.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.000
UH, ALL RIGHT,
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.917
THIS IS JEN LINDLEY,
AND I'M SIGNING OFF
FOR THE SUMMER.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.291
UH, BUT IT'S BEEN A BLAST.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.542
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED
SHARING THE MUSIC THAT I LIKE

09:02.542 --> 09:04.708
AND HAVING
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO VENT,

09:04.708 --> 09:07.625
SO, I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS THANK YOU ALL
FOR LISTENING,

09:07.625 --> 09:11.041
AND I'LL CATCH YOU
ON THE FLIP SIDE.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.041
Audrey: THAT WAS
NOT HALF-BAD, DAWSON.

09:20.041 --> 09:23.792
I WAS EXPECTING
A WAY MORE DISGUSTING
CULINARY EXPERIENCE.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.625
WELL, THANK YOU.
I'LL HAVE TO PASS IT
ON TO MY MOM.

09:25.625 --> 09:29.959
OK, WELL...
I'M GONNA GO.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.542
WHERE?

09:31.542 --> 09:32.750
TO THAT LITTLE
CHARMING INDIE
RECORD STORE OVER THERE.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.208
I'M GONNA STOCK UP
ON CDs FOR THE FLIGHT.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.542
AND IF THEY FAIL TO TAKE
MY MIND OFF THE FLYING,

09:36.542 --> 09:39.166
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE
TOMORROW, DAWSON.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.291
I AM BUT YOUR HUMBLE
SERVANT, AUDREY.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.959
COOL. AND BESIDES,
IF I KNOW YOU TWO,

09:42.959 --> 09:46.333
THERE ARE THINGS TO BE SAID,
BITTERSWEETNESS TO BE HAD,

09:46.333 --> 09:50.583
THINGS REQUIRING ALONE TIME
AND NATURE AND WHATNOT.

09:53.834 --> 09:54.834
JO, DO ME A FAVOR.
WHAT'S THAT?

09:54.834 --> 09:57.333
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
NEVER MARRY A LAWYER.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.500
WHAT?

09:58.500 --> 09:59.458
JUST PROMISE.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.083
WELL, WHAT IF HE
HAPPENS TO BE A LAWYER

10:02.083 --> 10:03.834
WHO USES HIS POWERS
FOR GOOD?

10:03.834 --> 10:06.291
HE'S A TIRELESS CRUSADER
FOR CHILDREN

10:06.291 --> 10:07.750
OR THE ENVIRONMENT PERHAPS.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.000
WHAT?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
UH, NOTHING. LET'S--
NEVER MIND.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.708
LET'S JUST CHANGE
THE SUBJECT ENTIRELY.

10:13.708 --> 10:13.917
UM...

10:18.250 --> 10:19.667
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY?

10:19.667 --> 10:20.583
WHAT?

10:20.583 --> 10:21.834
LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME,

10:21.834 --> 10:26.250
SAYING GOOD-BYE WAS
SO EPIC AND DRAMATIC,

10:26.250 --> 10:30.000
AND IT FELT LIKE
WE WERE NEVER GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.708
LITTLE DID YOU KNOW
I'D BE SHOWING UP AT
YOUR DOOR 3 MONTHS LATER.

10:36.458 --> 10:37.875
YOU EVER REGRET IT?

10:39.625 --> 10:42.125
NOT FOR A SINGLE SECOND.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.125
DO YOU?

10:43.125 --> 10:45.500
NOT AT ALL.

10:46.792 --> 10:51.792
OPENING
MY DOOR THAT MORNING,
SEEING YOU THERE,

10:51.792 --> 10:52.792
SOMETHING
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.125
DAWSON.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.083
YEAH.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.208
WHY'D YOU COME ALL
THE WAY TO FLORIDA?

11:13.834 --> 11:15.667
I DON'T THINK
YOU WANNA HEAR IT, JO.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.000
DAWSON,
FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE,

11:18.000 --> 11:18.708
I'LL NEVER NOT
WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING

11:18.708 --> 11:19.875
THAT YOU WANT TO SAY.

11:24.708 --> 11:27.667
I WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA
TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.125
SEE?

11:35.125 --> 11:37.667
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HEAR, IS IT?

11:37.667 --> 11:41.000
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.417
BY THE TIME
I GOT DOWN THERE,

11:42.417 --> 11:44.041
IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS
THAT YOU'D MOVED ON.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.834
I WASN'T ABOUT TO ASK YOU
TO DROP EVERYTHING

11:46.834 --> 11:49.375
JUST BECAUSE
I'D FINALLY SEEN THE LIGHT.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.875
I MEAN THAT
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAIR.

11:53.667 --> 11:57.834
WELL,
W-WHEN DID THINGS...

11:57.834 --> 12:00.458
THAT THEY CHANGED
FOR YOU?

12:02.041 --> 12:03.708
THERE WAS A MOMENT.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.959
IT WAS
LILY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.500
AND I OPENED YOUR GIFT,
THAT BOOK OF SKETCHES.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.208
AND I JUST SAT THERE

12:11.208 --> 12:15.250
LOOKING AT THIS INCREDIBLE
REFLECTION OF WHO YOU ARE,

12:15.250 --> 12:20.542
AND I
JUST REALIZED I HATE IT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.542
DAWSON, HOW DO YOU KNOW

12:23.542 --> 12:26.083
THAT I'M NOT JUST THIS
SECURITY BLANKET FOR YOU?

12:26.083 --> 12:30.542
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT
YOU'LL KEEP COMING BACK TO

12:30.542 --> 12:32.500
WHENEVER THE WORLD
GETS SCARY?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.083
IT'S NOT THE WORLD
I'M SCARED OF, JO.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.667
I'M SORRY, DAWSON.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.583
I CAN'T DO THIS.

13:19.959 --> 13:22.792
WHEN I AM 3,000 MILES
AWAY TRYING ON SHOES
AT FRED SEGAL,

13:22.792 --> 13:24.458
YOU WILL MISS ME,
AND YOU'LL WISH

13:24.458 --> 13:26.000
THAT YOU HAD FILLED ME
IN ON THE DETAILS.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.458
AUDREY, THERE
ARE NO DETAILS.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.166
OK, WHO ARE YOU GONNA
UNBURDEN YOUR SOUL TO
IF NOT TO ME?

13:40.166 --> 13:41.375
NOBODY, THAT'S WHO,

13:41.375 --> 13:43.291
AND THAT IS NOT GOOD
FOR YOUR COMPLEXION,
JOEY.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.542
NOT GOOD
FOR YOUR COMPLEXION,

13:44.542 --> 13:45.500
IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR YOUR SOUL
IF YOU EVEN HAVE ONE.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.291
AUDREY.
JOEY.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.500
AUDREY.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.083
I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU RIGHT NOW

13:50.083 --> 13:51.458
THAT I'VE NEVER SAID
TO YOU BEFORE,

13:51.458 --> 13:53.208
SOMETHING THAT COMES
COMPLETELY FROM A PLACE

13:53.208 --> 13:54.583
OF LOVE, UNDERSTANDING,
AND RESPECT

13:54.583 --> 13:57.333
FOR ALL THE JOY THAT
YOU BROUGHT TO MY LIFE
THIS PAST YEAR.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.500
OH, BUDDY.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.542
YOU ARE SO CHER
FROM MOONSTRUCK
RIGHT NOW.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.208
THAT'S OK.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.542
HELP, PLEASE?

14:08.542 --> 14:10.667
OH.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.458
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE AGAIN?

14:12.458 --> 14:13.917
I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL BE NECESSARY.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.500
OK. OK,
THIS IS IT.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.792
HUG ME QUICK.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.500
TELL YOUR SISTER
I SAID THANK YOU.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.333
I WILL.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.333
WHO'S TALKING?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.542
'CAUSE ANYTHING
THAT YOU SAY

14:27.542 --> 14:28.667
WILL JUST RUIN IT.
RUIN WHAT?

14:28.667 --> 14:31.625
THE BEST YEAR
OF MY LIFE.

14:31.625 --> 14:34.000
OK. OK.

14:43.708 --> 14:44.166
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER.

14:46.542 --> 14:49.083

15:02.875 --> 15:05.083
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

15:08.375 --> 15:10.417
HEY, COULD YOU GUYS
TURN THAT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT?

15:12.083 --> 15:13.083
WITTER?

15:13.083 --> 15:13.959
BRECHER.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.792
GOD! IT IS SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.917

TO SEE YOU, TOO.

15:19.917 --> 15:21.708
HEY, LAURIE, THIS

NICE TO MEET YA.

15:22.917 --> 15:23.792

15:23.792 --> 15:25.250
IT'S GLORY,

15:25.250 --> 15:26.208
GLORY. SORRY.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.542
I'M GONNA
TAKE A SHOWER.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.375
FUNNY THING, DANNY,
BUT LAURIE/GLORY

15:34.375 --> 15:35.792
DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING
LIKE YOUR WIFE.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.834
YEAH. THE WIFE AND I,

15:37.834 --> 15:40.000
WE DIDN'T MAKE IT.
SHE DUMPED MY ASS.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.875
WHAT, I CAN ONLY IGNORE
THIS OUTFIT SO LONG.

15:41.875 --> 15:42.875
WHAT GIVES?

15:42.875 --> 15:44.917
THIS IS MY SUMMER JOB,

ON CIVILIZATION,

15:46.959 --> 15:47.959

SO I HAD TO QUIT.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.417
OH, I'M SENSING
A LITTLE RESENTMENT.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.750
I'M SORRY, KID, BUT I NEVER
PROMISED YOU A ROSE GARDEN.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.500
HEY, LOOK, IS THERE SOMETHING

THE RESTAURANT WORLD
WORKS FOR US.

YOU NEVER HAVE TO GROW UP.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.708

16:12.708 --> 16:14.875
HOW COOL IS THAT?

16:14.875 --> 16:19.500
SEE, I LOOK AT YOU,
AND I SEE MYSELF 15 YEARS AGO.

HI!

17:25.000 --> 17:29.083
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE'VE
JUST RUN OUT OF THINGS
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER?

17:29.083 --> 17:30.834
THAT'S
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.291
NO. WAY.
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

THIS IS A PRETTY
BIG COINCIDENCE.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.875
YEAH.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

17:53.875 --> 17:56.583
SO, WHAT ARE YOU--
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

17:56.583 --> 17:58.625

OH, YEAH. I JUST--
I WENT HOME
FOR THE SUMMER,

18:07.083 --> 18:08.125
SAW MY FOLKS.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.291
TURNED AROUND
AND CAME RIGHT BACK?

18:09.291 --> 18:15.583
YEAH. YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I HAD ALL THESE, UH,

18:15.583 --> 18:17.250
THESE GRAND PLANS,
YOU KNOW.

18:17.250 --> 18:21.417
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA
TELL 'EM AND...JUST,

18:21.417 --> 18:24.750
YOU KNOW, IT'S NEVER
REALLY FELT LIKE THE
RIGHT TIME, YOU KNOW.

18:24.750 --> 18:28.375
YEAH. YEAH,
IT, UH, NEVER IS.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.875
SO, I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA HANG OUT HERE
FOR THE SUMMER.

I'M GONNA GET A JOB,
TAKE SOME CLASSES,
OR...

18:36.125 --> 18:37.166
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:37.166 --> 18:39.000
UH, COSTA RICA WITH JEN.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.083
OH.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.959
THAT IS IF OUR FLIGHT
DOESN'T GET CANCELED.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.125
IT'S DELAYED, HUH?

18:43.125 --> 18:45.583
YEAH. WE COULD BE HERE
FOR A WHILE.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.125
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE
TO BE ANYWHERE.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.125
IF YOU WANT, I
COULD WAIT WITH YOU.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.417
NO. NAW, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OK.

18:52.417 --> 18:54.917
MY FRIENDS, THEY'RE
JUST, UH, BACK THERE.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.375
OH. RIGHT.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.500
OK.

UM, WELL, IT WAS
GREAT TO SEE YOU,
JACK.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.500
HAVE A--HAVE
A GREAT TRIP, MAN.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.166
THANKS.
IT'S GOOD SEEING YOU

19:06.166 --> 19:07.417
YEAH, YOU, TOO.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.166

YOU'RE BACK.

GET OFF OK?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.625
YEAH. SHE SAYS THANKS.
CAN I TAKE THE TRUCK?

19:16.625 --> 19:19.458
SURE, BUT YOU'RE NOT
TAKING MY GROCERIES WITH IT.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.291
FINE, BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF AN IMPRESSION
I'M GOING TO MAKE

19:22.291 --> 19:24.458
ON THE NEW MANAGEMENT IF
I'M LATE MY FIRST DAY BACK.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.375
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
STARTING UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.208
OH, WHY DELAY
THE INEVITABLE?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.083

ALMOST MEMORIAL DAY?

19:30.083 --> 19:31.166
OF COURSE.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.166
AND THE TOURISTS
ARE GONNA ARRIVE.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.917
TOURISTS AT WORK.
TOURISTS AT HOME.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.041
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK
AT THE YACHT CLUB, YOU KNOW.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.792
WHAT, FIND ANOTHER JOB?

19:38.792 --> 19:40.834
NAH. AT LEAST THIS WAY
IT'S OFFICIAL.

19:40.834 --> 19:43.166
JOEY POTTER, BACK
WHERE SHE STARTED FROM.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.834
IT'S NICE TO SEE
COLLEGE HASN'T SQUASHED
YOUR INNER DRAMA QUEEN.

19:45.834 --> 19:46.500
CAN I GO NOW?

19:46.500 --> 19:47.333
YES.
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.625
OH, DID YOU
BRING IN THE MAIL?

19:49.625 --> 19:50.125
NO.
CAN YOU?

19:50.125 --> 19:51.625
NO. I'M LATE.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.875

THE 6:45 TO LAS VEGAS.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.542

20:38.542 --> 20:39.333
OK.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.500
DON'T YOU DARE TELL JENNIFER.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.000
I--I THINK THESE LITTLE
GETAWAYS ARE MUCH MORE FUN

20:44.000 --> 20:46.166
IF THEY'RE DONE ON THE SLY.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.750
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE
WITH ME.

20:48.750 --> 20:49.667
GOOD.

20:49.667 --> 20:53.291
WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD BE GOING.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.667
HUGS, HMM?

20:57.417 --> 20:59.959

DAWSON. YOU'VE EARNED IT.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.458
THANK YOU.
I THANK YOU...

21:01.458 --> 21:04.625
AGAIN SO MUCH
FOR EVERYTHING,
FOR TAKING ME IN--

21:04.625 --> 21:07.959
NO. THANK YOU FOR MAKING
MY GRANDDAUGHTER HAPPY.

21:07.959 --> 21:10.583
THEY'RE STILL HERE.
THEIR FLIGHT GOT DELAYED.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.792
NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE'VE SAID OUR GOOD-BYES.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.250
AND BESIDES, I--

21:15.250 --> 21:18.917
I WOULD HATE FOR HER
TO THINK I WAS DOING
THE GRAMS THING,

21:18.917 --> 21:21.125
TRYING TO GET HER
TO CHANGE HER MIND.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.250
ABOUT WHAT?

21:22.250 --> 21:23.875
HER PARENTS, OF COURSE.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.959
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

21:31.959 --> 21:34.166
RELAX, WOULD YOU?
I CAN'T JUST DROP BY?

21:34.166 --> 21:35.625
NO.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.291
LOOK, BESS, I'M SORRY
IF I SEEM SHORT WITH YOU
THIS AFTERNOON.

21:38.291 --> 21:43.291
IT'S JUST...THIS PLACE,
BEING BACK.

21:43.291 --> 21:45.250
I KNOW. NOT THAT
IT'S ANY OF MY BUSINESS.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.250
IT'S NOT?
NO.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.041
YOU'RE AN ADULT NOW,
JOEY.

21:48.041 --> 21:48.625
OFFICIALLY.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.166
IT'S NOT THE SAME HERE
WITHOUT YOU, YOU KNOW.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.291
I KNOW.

21:55.291 --> 21:56.625
AND YOU'RE
NOT THE SAME.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.250
I KNOW
YOU THINK YOU ARE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.708
YOU EVEN
LOOK DIFFERENT.

21:59.708 --> 22:01.333
HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.625
YOU WERE GONNA GO
TO FRANCE, REMEMBER?

22:07.625 --> 22:09.750
YOU WERE GIVING ME
ALL THAT GRIEF
ABOUT GOING TO SEE DAD.

22:09.750 --> 22:10.917
I REMEMBER.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.667
YOU WENT TO THE POST OFFICE
AND YOU GOT THE FORM.

22:12.667 --> 22:13.959
YOU HAD YOUR PICTURE TAKEN.

22:13.959 --> 22:14.875
YEAH, BUT I NEVER SENT IT IN.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.667
I DID. IF YOU
CAME BACK THIS SUMMER

22:17.667 --> 22:19.542
BECAUSE
YOU THINK WE NEED YOU,

22:19.542 --> 22:19.959
WELL, WE DON'T.

22:19.959 --> 22:22.166
WOW.

22:23.834 --> 22:26.834
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER
MAGIC TRICKS IN THAT BAG
OF YOURS, DO YOU?

22:26.834 --> 22:28.125
WELL, AS A MATTER
OF FACT...

22:30.792 --> 22:31.834
WHAT'S THIS?

22:31.834 --> 22:33.917
GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO
OPEN IT TO FIND OUT.

22:37.917 --> 22:40.083
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

22:40.083 --> 22:41.333
WE'RE NOT STILL FRIENDS?

22:41.333 --> 22:42.041
YEAH, WE'RE FRIENDS.

22:42.041 --> 22:44.333
OF COURSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.125
WE'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE FRIENDS.

22:46.125 --> 22:49.291
BUT RIGHT NOW,
IT FEELS LIKE THAT'S
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.500
ME BEING HONEST
WITH YOU IS A PROBLEM?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.166
YEAH. WHAT--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:53.166 --> 22:56.166
IF IT INVOLVES ME
HAVING TO GO SEE
MY PARENTS, YES, IT IS.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.708
I'M SORRY, JEN,
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.

22:57.708 --> 22:59.542
CAN YOU PLEASE
LET THIS SLIDE?

22:59.542 --> 23:01.417
I CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN.

23:01.417 --> 23:03.250
NO, I CAN'T,
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
AND CARE ABOUT YOU,

23:03.250 --> 23:05.750
I KNOW THAT YOU REALLY WANT
TO WORK THINGS OUT
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.000
I KNOW THIS
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.667
GREAT, SO NOW
THE THINGS THAT I SAID

23:08.667 --> 23:10.417
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER ARE
GONNA BE USED AGAINST ME.

23:10.417 --> 23:12.083
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID
HURT YOU.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.959
ALL RIGHT, BUT I ALSO KNOW

23:13.959 --> 23:15.208
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GROW UP
UNLESS YOU FACE THIS THING

23:15.208 --> 23:17.291
AND YOU FACE IT HEAD ON.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.875
I AGREE WITH YOU.
I DO.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.041
THEN YOU'RE GOING.

23:25.041 --> 23:27.917
NO. I'M NOT.

23:27.917 --> 23:31.250
NOT EVERYBODY IS AS
STRONG AS YOU, DAWSON.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.041
NOT EVERYBODY CAN RISE
TO THE OCCASION

23:33.041 --> 23:35.500
AND DO THE RIGHT THING
ALL THE TIME.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.250
MAYBE SOME OF US
ARE JUST SCREWED UP

23:39.250 --> 23:40.834
AND THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT.

23:40.834 --> 23:42.208
YOU DON'T
REALLY BELIEVE THAT.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.291
MAYBE I DO,
MAYBE I DON'T.

23:43.291 --> 23:47.542
[SIGHS] DOES IT
REALLY MATTER?

23:47.542 --> 23:49.291
IT MATTERS TO ME.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.917
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

23:55.917 --> 23:58.000
LIE AND TELL ME
THAT YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.708
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

24:14.625 --> 24:15.792
SO, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

24:15.792 --> 24:19.458
IS HE ANY MORE GAY THAN
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.917
VERY FUNNY.

24:21.792 --> 24:25.458
HE, UH, TRIED
TO TELL HIS PARENTS.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.083
HE TRIED.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.834
IT'S A HARD THING
TO DO, YOU KNOW.

24:29.834 --> 24:30.750
I KNOW.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.625
I WASN'T
VERY HELPFUL.

24:34.625 --> 24:37.291
IS THAT YOUR JOB
TO BE HELPFUL?

24:37.291 --> 24:39.500
IT'S MY JOB
TO BE NICE.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.250
YOU ARE NICE.

24:41.250 --> 24:42.667
YEAH?
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

24:42.667 --> 24:46.583
BECAUSE YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
BEEN SITTING HERE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

24:46.583 --> 24:49.291
HOW TO HELP SOMEBODY
WHO HASN'T BEEN
VERY NICE TO YOU.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.917
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:54.291 --> 24:57.250
I MEAN,
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.917
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD
TO SEE SOMEBODY

24:58.917 --> 25:01.000
GO THROUGH
THE EXACT SAME THING
THAT I WENT THROUGH.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.708
AND NOT DOING ANYTHING
TO HELP THEM.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.250
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, JEN?

25:04.250 --> 25:07.333
WHEN SOMEBODY'S THAT CONFUSED
AND MESSED UP, YOU JUST...

25:07.333 --> 25:07.708
HAVE TO BE THEIR FRIEND.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.291
HE WOULDN'T
APPRECIATE IT, YOU KNOW?

25:13.708 --> 25:15.208
I KNOW.

25:15.208 --> 25:18.500
AND IT'D BE A WASTE
OF AN ENTIRE SUMMER.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.083
PLUS YOU'D BE
TOTALLY BAILING ON ME.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.500
EGREGIOUSLY BAILING.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.250
UNFORGIVABLY BAILING.

25:25.250 --> 25:30.959
YEAH, EXCEPT
THAT I'D FORGIVE YOU.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.875
AHH...

25:39.291 --> 25:41.375
HOW STUPID IS THIS?

25:41.375 --> 25:42.291
VERY.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.542
YOU COULD COME.
CAN'T.

25:43.542 --> 25:43.834
COULD.
WON'T.

25:45.333 --> 25:49.208
OK, YOU SHOULD GO.

25:49.208 --> 25:51.500
GO AND HELP SOMEONE.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.291
THAT WAY MAYBE OUR YEAR
WON'T BE A TOTAL WASH.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.708
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

25:56.708 --> 25:59.250
I DON'T KNOW.

26:00.166 --> 26:02.750
MAYBE IT'S TIME
I GO HELP MYSELF.

26:30.583 --> 26:33.458
I KNOW YOU.
HOW DO I KNOW YOU?

26:33.458 --> 26:34.667
YOU FIRED ME.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.875
WELL, I'VE FIRED
A LOT OF PEOPLE, KID.

26:37.875 --> 26:39.250
WHAT WAS YOUR OFFENSE?

26:39.250 --> 26:41.708
I SPILLED SOME COFFEE
ON THE SET OF DAMAGE, INC.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.875
OH, I REMEMBER YOU,
THE MORALISTIC FILM STUDENT.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.708
YOU WERE ANNOYING.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.250
THANKS.

26:47.250 --> 26:48.708
STILL IN FILM SCHOOL?

26:48.708 --> 26:51.458
NOPE. I WENT BACK HOME
AFTER THAT, ACTUALLY.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.125
AW, POOR BABY.

26:53.125 --> 26:55.000
DID I CRAP ALL OVER
YOUR HOLLYWOOD DREAMS?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.041
NOT NEARLY AS MUCH

26:56.041 --> 26:58.125
AS THE CRITICS CRAPPED
ALL OVER YOUR MOVIE.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.208
YOU'VE STILL GOT BALLS, KID.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.291
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THAT LITTLE SPEECH YOU GAVE ME

27:05.291 --> 27:06.250
KEPT ME UP A NIGHT OR TWO.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.125
REALLY?
SURE.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.333
STILL, YOU'RE
PRETTY OPINIONATED

27:09.333 --> 27:11.125
FOR SOMEBODY'S
WHO'S NOT EVEN IN THE GAME.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.291
THAT'S ME, THE
MORALISTIC FILM STUDENT.

27:14.291 --> 27:16.458
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

27:16.458 --> 27:17.625
BACK TO L.A. ACTUALLY.

27:18.583 --> 27:21.083
GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

27:21.083 --> 27:24.250
I MIGHT WANNA WATCH ONE OF
THOSE LITTLE MOVIES YOU MAKE.

27:26.083 --> 27:29.875
THAT IS IF YOU DON'T CHICKEN OUT
AND RUN SCARED THIS TIME.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.708
HEY.

27:51.708 --> 27:51.917
HEY.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.291
MAY I?

27:57.291 --> 28:00.834
YEAH, BUT YOU REALLY
DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE.

28:00.834 --> 28:01.250
HEAD LICE?

28:01.250 --> 28:04.458
NO.

28:04.458 --> 28:08.625
I SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN VICTIM
TO THE CAPESIDE DISEASE.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.583
AND WHAT IS THAT
EXACTLY?

28:12.583 --> 28:14.166
FEELING TRAPPED,

28:14.166 --> 28:18.500
FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF,
SORT OF GENERAL INABILITY
TO SEE THE FUTURE.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.708
YOU MEAN
BEING A TEENAGER.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.708
YOU KNOW WHAT, PACE?

28:26.708 --> 28:28.834
AND DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

28:28.834 --> 28:31.750
BUT, WELL,
DESPITE YOUR PENSION
FOR SUGAR-COATED CEREALS

28:31.750 --> 28:33.417
AND SATURDAY MORNING
CARTOONS,

28:33.417 --> 28:35.875
YOU MAY BE THE MOST
ADULT PERSON I KNOW.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.166
[SNICKERS]

28:37.166 --> 28:38.500
YOU NEVER LOOK BACK,
DO YOU?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.667
WHY WOULD YOU LOOK BACK?
THE FUTURE'S OUT THERE.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.375
AND WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

28:43.375 --> 28:43.834
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

28:43.834 --> 28:45.333
SURE, I DO.

28:45.333 --> 28:46.875
JUST NOT FOR YOURSELF?
COME AGAIN?

28:46.875 --> 28:47.917
PACE, YOU'RE PIGHEADED,

28:47.917 --> 28:50.542
AND DON'T BOTHER
TRYING TO CONTRADICT ME

28:50.542 --> 28:52.583
BECAUSE I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT
TO SAY THESE THINGS.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.625
PACEY, YOU NEED TO BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF MORE.

29:00.417 --> 29:01.834
OK, POINT TAKEN.

29:07.208 --> 29:07.917
YOU MISS HER, DON'T YOU?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.250
AUDREY?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.458
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE
CONVERSATION

29:14.458 --> 29:15.583
FOR LAST YEAR'S
CLASS COUPLE
TO HAVE, DO YOU?

29:15.583 --> 29:18.625
FINE, BUT I MISS HER.

29:18.625 --> 29:21.083
SHE CHANGED MY LIFE,
YOU KNOW.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.750
YEAH, I KNOW.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.500
OF COURSE,
THERE'S ALWAYS
THE OTHER OPTION.

29:28.583 --> 29:29.959
HMM?

29:29.959 --> 29:31.125
THAT YOU  CHANGED IT.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.500
FINE. I GUESS I DID.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.750
I GUESS YOU DID.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.750
AND ALTHOUGH
I HAVE NO IDEA

29:41.750 --> 29:42.750
WHAT WAS IN THAT LETTER
YOU WERE JUST READING,

29:42.750 --> 29:44.000
I HAVE
THIS FUNNY FEELING

29:44.000 --> 29:45.792
YOU WERE SITTING HERE,
IN TRUE JOEY FASHION,

29:45.792 --> 29:48.500
WISHING THAT
YOU COULD UNCHANGE IT.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.291
NO, I DON'T.

29:55.291 --> 29:57.041
LET'S GO.
GO WHERE?

29:57.041 --> 29:58.917
WE'RE NOT JUST
GONNA SIT HERE.
WE'RE GONNA GO.

29:58.917 --> 30:00.625
AND I WOULD ASK AGAIN,
GO WHERE?

30:00.625 --> 30:02.750
YOU WANT HER BACK,
DON'T YOU?

30:02.750 --> 30:04.000
WELL?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.083
JO, IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR ALL THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

30:06.083 --> 30:07.500
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE AIRPORT,
WE'RE GONNA FIND THEM,

30:07.500 --> 30:10.708
WE'RE GONNA SAY
EVERYTHING THAT WE REALLY
WANT TO SAY TO THEM.

30:10.708 --> 30:13.458
WE WOULD DO THAT BECAUSE...
BECAUSE WE CAN. COME ON.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.834
OH, NO.
THEY'RE BOARDING.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.125
AW, DAMN IT!

30:27.125 --> 30:29.792
WELL, I GUESS
WE SCREWED THE POOCH
ON THIS ONE.

30:29.792 --> 30:31.667
NO. NO,
WE DIDN'T YET.

30:31.667 --> 30:33.542
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LET US THROUGH
WITHOUT A TICKET.

30:33.542 --> 30:34.959
I'LL GO BUY ONE.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.708
DOES THIS DAWSON CHARACTER
REALLY MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU?

30:36.708 --> 30:39.000
OK, I'M JUST KIDDIN'.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I'LL GO BUY THE TICKET
AND STOP AUDREY.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M ON SUCH THIN ICE
WITH THIS WHOLE THING

30:43.000 --> 30:45.250
THAT IF I WANT
TO MAKE THIS OVERTURE,

30:45.250 --> 30:46.708
I SHOULD AT LEAST
BE PRESENT FOR IT.

30:46.708 --> 30:48.417
YOU GO BUY YOUR TICKET,
AND I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

30:48.417 --> 30:49.834
OK, GOOD LUCK.

30:49.834 --> 30:50.959
I'LL SEE YOU.
BYE.

30:50.959 --> 30:51.583
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO FLY FIRST-CLASS.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.667
WHAT IS IT, ANYWAY?

30:53.667 --> 30:55.500
IT'S A HOT TOWEL.
I HATE THE HOT TOWEL.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.917
IT'S HOT.

30:56.917 --> 30:59.041
I'D BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE
ON COACH WITH MY PEOPLE.

30:59.041 --> 31:01.000
AS I'VE EXPLAINED
COUNTLESS TIMES,
LITTLE MISS,

31:01.000 --> 31:02.083
THERE ARE NO
COACH TICKETS AVAILABLE.

31:02.083 --> 31:04.917
ZERO. AND IF YOU WANT
TO GET TO NEW YORK NOW,

31:04.917 --> 31:06.834
I SUGGEST
YOU TAKE THIS TICKET.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.000
FINE.

31:11.542 --> 31:12.583
HEY.

31:12.583 --> 31:13.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:13.667 --> 31:15.208
IT'S COMPLICATED. UM...

31:15.208 --> 31:16.667
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOING TO COSTA RICA.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.250
I WAS. NOW I'M NOT.

31:19.250 --> 31:22.375
THANKS TO YOUR FRIEND
AND MINE, AND SOMETHING
TELLS ME IT PROBABLY

31:22.375 --> 31:24.875
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WHY YOU'RE STANDING
IN LINE RIGHT NOW.

31:24.875 --> 31:26.375
MMM-MAYBE.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.750
THERE'S SO MUCH
THAT I WANT TO SAY THAT
I'M SORRY FOR THIS YEAR,

31:28.750 --> 31:30.166
BUT THERE'S NO TIME,
AND I--

31:30.166 --> 31:33.208
GIVE ME A HUG.
OK.

31:33.208 --> 31:33.750
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER.

31:33.750 --> 31:36.375
THANKS. YOU, TOO.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.792
I LOVE YOU, JO.

31:37.792 --> 31:39.500
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.708
OK, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW I ASKED YOU

31:50.708 --> 31:52.208
IF YOU'D MIND
PUNCHING ME IN THE FACE?

31:52.208 --> 31:53.583
YEAH.
COULD YOU?

31:53.583 --> 31:55.125
WHEN WE'RE SEATED,
I PROMISE.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.959
OK. OK.

31:56.959 --> 32:00.125
P.A.: BLUE STAR AIRLINES
PAGING LOS ANGELES PASSENGER
AUDREY LIDDELL.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.917
PLEASE PICK UP
THE WHITE COURTESY PHONE.

32:01.917 --> 32:04.208
AUDREY LIDDELL, PLEASE PICK UP
THE WHITE COURTESY PHONE.

32:04.208 --> 32:07.166
DON'T YOU DARE GET ON
THE PLANE WITHOUT ME.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.583
HELLO. AUDREY LIDDELL
SPEAKING.

32:12.583 --> 32:13.583
AUDREY.
PACEY?

32:13.583 --> 32:15.708
HEY, IT'S ME.

32:15.708 --> 32:18.208
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

32:18.208 --> 32:19.750
I'M SORRY, AUDREY.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.917
