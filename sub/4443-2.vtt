<i>Previously on The Fosters...</i>

00:02.557 --> 00:04.786
She got into a fight
with her foster father?

00:04.810 --> 00:06.186
That's how she landed in juvie.

00:06.186 --> 00:07.594
This is for a few weeks, right?

00:07.714 --> 00:08.744
You're stealing my pills?

00:08.745 --> 00:10.206
What do you need all that money for anyway?

00:10.207 --> 00:12.126
- I've been talking to Ana.
- Our birth mom?

00:12.127 --> 00:13.725
You know, I'm just trying
to get back on my feet.

00:13.726 --> 00:14.526
Here.

00:15.018 --> 00:16.297
- Where are you going?
- It's my brother.

00:16.352 --> 00:18.120
You're gonna get me sent back to juvie.

00:18.127 --> 00:19.793
And Jude is gonna be stuck in that house.

00:19.832 --> 00:21.037
Can I help you?

00:21.084 --> 00:23.289
- I was looking for the metro.
- The Metro's a few miles from here.

00:23.344 --> 00:25.822
Whoa, hey! What the
hell are you doing here?

00:25.823 --> 00:28.248
- I just want to talk to Jude.
- No! Shut up! No!

00:28.264 --> 00:30.250
Freeze! Get down on your knees now!

00:30.258 --> 00:31.611
Hands on your head!

00:31.731 --> 00:34.121
We are not sending these
kids back into the system.

00:34.137 --> 00:37.109
- We really don't have the room.
- Then we'll make room.

00:38.579 --> 00:40.425
Jesus, the trash needs to go out.

00:40.432 --> 00:41.660
I shouldn't have to remind you.

00:41.676 --> 00:43.475
- I took them out yesterday.
- Well, it's full again.

00:43.483 --> 00:45.453
And get off your skateboard, please.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.242
And, it's not because what you did
last night wasn't really dumb.

00:53.362 --> 00:55.901
And I don't use those words
for lack of bigger ones.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.098
It was really dumb.

00:57.113 --> 00:59.225
My God, what were you thinking?

00:59.413 --> 01:02.409
Running off, chasing
after some girl. Come one.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.864
Even if it was to help her brother.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.180
- Why didn't you just call me?
- I know, I know..

01:08.196 --> 01:09.806
It was a big mistake.

01:09.806 --> 01:11.175
It could have been a fatal mistake,

01:11.175 --> 01:13.443
love, you had no idea
what you were walking into.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.703
Could have been much much worse than that.

01:15.718 --> 01:17.212
I mean, it won't happen again.

01:17.235 --> 01:20.082
You're damn right it won't happen again.
I gotta be honest with you, my friend.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.436
I was ready to drop the hammer.

01:23.859 --> 01:26.190
But after talking with Lena, we have

01:26.635 --> 01:29.029
decided that you are probably very aware

01:29.060 --> 01:31.664
- of the potential consequences
of your actions, yes?
- Yes.

01:32.306 --> 01:35.098
And this is pretty out of character for you,

01:35.457 --> 01:38.500
so we are not going to ground
you, but I am telling you,

01:38.523 --> 01:40.932
this will never ever happen again.

01:45.179 --> 01:46.297
Hmm, where's Mariana? 

01:46.337 --> 01:47.666
Oh, she's still in the bathroom.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.543
Mariana, come on! Let's go, babe.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.732
We've gotta eat.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.203
- Callie, can you put juice out for everybody?
- Yeah.

01:53.323 --> 01:55.134
I didn't have time to do my hair.

01:55.165 --> 01:56.573
Well, it's too late now sweetie.

01:56.565 --> 01:57.762
We still have 15 minutes.

01:57.762 --> 02:00.233
No no no. You guys have to walk
to school today. We have a thing.

02:00.257 --> 02:01.383
Come on. Come eat.

02:01.399 --> 02:03.839
I am not going to school
with my hair like this.

02:03.862 --> 02:06.302
Well then you're not
going anywhere, ever again.

02:06.357 --> 02:07.999
Stef, your pancakes are burning.

02:08.007 --> 02:10.987
Great. I get to spend all
day looking like a ***.

02:11.009 --> 02:12.761
***

02:12.800 --> 02:15.108
- Enough.
- Ok, guys you have to be out the door in 10.

02:15.116 --> 02:16.524
Stef and I have a meeting with Bill.

02:16.797 --> 02:19.277
And then I'm gonna take Jude to come
later to school, to show him around.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.476
He'll be ok. I promise.

02:22.671 --> 02:24.892
I'm not gonna let them
split you two up again, ok?

02:26.026 --> 02:27.504
Yeah.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.522
All right, pancakes everybody.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.844
Who wants pancakes? ***, you want pancakes?

02:32.894 --> 02:34.599
Brandon, pass them around, please.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.458
Ow! Ok, Jesus, how many times have we said,

02:39.493 --> 02:41.294
no skateboard in the house?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.062
- Have you taken your pill this morning?
- Yes.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.363
- No.
- No.

02:46.984 --> 02:50.086
- Jude, dude, come on.
- Sorry.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.204

03:52.649 --> 03:53.933
I didn't have time to
dry my hair this morning.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.801
There were like 300 people in the bathroom.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.636
You look fine, I'm sure
no one's going to notice.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.988
What happened to your hair?

03:59.022 --> 04:00.656
Jesus, you idiot!

04:00.691 --> 04:02.975
He may be an idiot, but
damn your brother's so hot.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.744
Oh my God, ew.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.645
Hey, do you have any more you know what?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.665
- I only have a couple left.
- No, and I can't get any more.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.584
- Really?
- Really.

04:11.618 --> 04:12.952
Ok, see you babes at lunch.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.622
Bye. So, what happened last
night with your birth mom?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.724
- Jesus found out.
- He found out?

04:18.759 --> 04:19.959
- Did he freak?
- Completely.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.928
- Did he go with you?
- No. He yelled at me.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.631
So, how was it?

04:25.665 --> 04:28.000
Honestly? It kind of sucked.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.770
Well, at least you don't have to
invite her to your quinceanera.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.805
That would've been awkward.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.007
Come on, we're going to be late.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.644
[Stef] Have you thought any
more about what you want to do?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.696
- About Callie and Jude?
- Mm.

04:40.731 --> 04:41.881
No.

04:41.915 --> 04:45.618
To be honest, I just keep thinking about

04:45.652 --> 04:47.820
seeing you and Brandon in
that house with a gun...

04:47.854 --> 04:49.622
- We were fine.
- I know you were fine.

04:49.656 --> 04:53.025
I know that. But in my
mind, when you go to work,

04:53.060 --> 04:56.829
you are writing parking tickets
and pulling cats out of trees.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.664
- That's firemen.
- You know what I'm saying.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.700
- Don't insult me.
- You know what I mean.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.668
I just keep flashing back

05:02.703 --> 05:04.970
to you storming into that house
with your gun pulled out...

05:05.005 --> 05:07.006
It's what I do, love.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.009
I get this awful feeling in my stomach.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.745
And I cannot help but
connect that back to Callie.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.884
- Meaning?
- Meaning,

05:18.919 --> 05:21.020
I know that you said we're not
going to put them back in the system

05:21.054 --> 05:26.025
but, I have some really serious concerns.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.860
[Doorbell rings]

05:27.894 --> 05:29.695
- That's Bill.
- There's Bill.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.697
- [Bell rings]
- Ok, bye.

05:35.719 --> 05:39.471
- Hey.
- Hey, you...

05:39.489 --> 05:41.741
Ah, did I just see Callie down the hall?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.676
I don't know, did you?

05:43.710 --> 05:45.511
I'm just surprised is all.

05:45.545 --> 05:48.214
I mean, I figured after
last night they would've...

05:48.248 --> 05:50.082
- Would've?
- Sent her back to juvie,

05:50.117 --> 05:51.484
or another foster home or something.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.171
Yeah, well, they're not.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.989
I mean, not now, at least.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.991
Mm. Good.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.978
- You ok?
- Totally. I'm fine.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.865
- You're sure?
- Brandon, I'm fine.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.566
Are we still on for Friday?

06:07.601 --> 06:09.735
It's not every weekend
my parents go out of town.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.704
- You know I'm down.
- Good.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.374
Now get to class.

06:20.414 --> 06:23.215
Then a few years later, when
Callie was 10, I think...

06:23.250 --> 06:24.483
yes, that's right.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.385
Her mother died suddenly.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.421
Her father obviously wasn't in the picture,

06:28.455 --> 06:30.122
and there were no other
family members to call on.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.124
So, they were put into the system.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.226
Unfortunately, they haven't
been able to land anywhere,

06:34.261 --> 06:35.928
for more than six months at a time.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.797
Could I trouble you for
some more coffee, please?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.131
Yeah, of course.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.100
Now, we keep trying to put
them somewhere permanent,

06:41.134 --> 06:42.431
but then something happens,

06:42.432 --> 06:44.522
and we have to move
them onto somewhere new.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.807
Something happens? What
exactly does that mean?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.643
- Something like last night?
- I feel terrible about that.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.511
That is my fault.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.380
I had an emergency on another case.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.671
Otherwise, I would've been there for Callie

06:55.672 --> 06:56.672
and connected her with Jude,

06:56.616 --> 06:59.518
and none of that would've
happened. Thank you.

06:59.553 --> 07:03.389
Look, they're really great kids,

07:03.423 --> 07:06.058
they've just had bad luck.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.962
That's just so heartbreaking.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.832
So you are looking for
something permanent for them?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.834
Always.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.904
We already have three teenagers.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.874
What do you think?

07:32.586 --> 07:36.655
So, the seventh grade classes
are mostly on the south corridor.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.340
With all the high school kids?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.459
- Yeah.
- Does that mean I get to see Callie?

07:40.494 --> 07:43.112
Well, not all the time,
but she'll be around.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.498
And if you need anything
at all, I'm always here, ok?

07:47.434 --> 07:49.134
- Hey.
- Morning.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.004
- Everything all right?
- Um.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.873
Hey Jude, why don't you
wait out in the hall,

07:53.907 --> 07:56.842
and I'll take you to class in a sec.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.143
Hey.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.747
What's up?

08:01.781 --> 08:04.683
So, I was on my way to class

08:04.718 --> 08:08.521
and I found this lying by a trash can.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.424
[Lena] Pills.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.265
Well, you know what this means.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.433
[Man] Locker search. Everyone line up.

08:40.351 --> 08:42.102
<i>* Roll the dice *</i>

09:23.310 --> 09:27.180
- What's this?
- It's ibuprofen. Over the counter.

09:31.118 --> 09:33.653
For cramps.

09:33.687 --> 09:35.855
Uh, you're good.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.561
How many kids are you selling to anyway?

09:41.579 --> 09:42.962
I don't know, five or six?

09:42.997 --> 09:45.698
You better hope none of them are
keeping their stash in their lockers.

09:49.737 --> 09:52.272
- Got the report filed.
- Good boy.

09:52.306 --> 09:53.606
- You driving?
- I'm driving.

09:53.641 --> 09:54.691
Ok.

10:03.317 --> 10:06.486
- So, that was quite a night?
- Yes, it was.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.022
Anybody run away this morning?

10:09.056 --> 10:11.908
That's funny. No. Nope.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.060
Gave Brandon quite a talking to though.

10:14.095 --> 10:17.063
But I've decided not to
ground him, so he's thrilled.

10:17.098 --> 10:19.198
What? You're kidding, right?

10:19.216 --> 10:21.000
No.

10:21.018 --> 10:22.969
The kid basically went awol last night,

10:22.987 --> 10:24.137
damn near got himself killed.

10:24.171 --> 10:26.706
Yeah, exactly. So, Lena thought that

10:26.740 --> 10:28.875
he's very well aware
of the consequences and

10:28.909 --> 10:30.827
no benefit to punishing him.

10:30.861 --> 10:34.581
- Oh, Lena thought.
- Ok, take it easy. Easy.

10:34.615 --> 10:37.617
First time he's ever done
anything like this before.

10:37.651 --> 10:39.619
Right, which is all the more
reason to set boundaries.

10:39.653 --> 10:41.721
We set plenty of boundaries for him.

10:41.739 --> 10:43.540
Well, apparently not enough.

10:43.574 --> 10:44.691
God.

10:44.725 --> 10:47.527
Look, I'm sure hippie-dippie Lena with her

10:47.561 --> 10:50.163
PhD in child... whatever the hell it is,

10:50.197 --> 10:52.432
has some opinions about why punishing him

10:52.466 --> 10:55.101
would damage his blossoming sense of self,

Listen, I'm sorry. Mike is right behind me.

have a discussion, a conversation
perhaps, in regards to Brandon.

15:52.093 --> 15:54.895
we've gone a little too easy on Brandon,

some sort of punishment.

23:22.176 --> 23:24.110
Call your dad.

23:24.144 --> 23:25.378
Yeah.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.249
[Door closes]

23:35.806 --> 23:37.924
Hi. Dinner is not quite ready yet.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.960
Do you want something to drink or... ?

23:40.995 --> 23:42.695
Is everything ok?

23:42.730 --> 23:44.964
Yeah, I was just wondering
if you had any chores for me.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.599
Chores?

23:46.634 --> 23:49.535
Yeah, well, foster families are
gonna send us away right away,

23:49.570 --> 23:51.537
they usually give us chores and stuff.

23:52.873 --> 23:54.707
You know what?

23:54.742 --> 23:57.310
You could really help me...

23:59.313 --> 24:01.214
I forgot the salad forks.

24:08.255 --> 24:10.189
So, are you and Stef married?

24:10.224 --> 24:14.894
Well, not exactly. Not legally, no.

24:14.928 --> 24:17.196
We're married in our hearts, I guess.

24:17.231 --> 24:19.999
That's basically the same thing, right?

24:20.034 --> 24:22.135
Basically, yeah.

24:23.904 --> 24:25.038
Yeah.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.540
[Stef] Everyone, grab a seat.

24:27.574 --> 24:30.610
So, we have something
to talk about, obviously.

24:30.644 --> 24:32.512
Uh, Stef and I had our meeting with bill,

24:32.546 --> 24:34.480
and we've come to a decision.

24:34.515 --> 24:38.551
We are not in a position to offer
Jude and Callie a home forever.

24:38.585 --> 24:40.720
[Stef] But we would like you
guys to be as comfortable and safe

24:40.754 --> 24:43.423
as possible, until bill does
find you a permanent home.

24:43.457 --> 24:46.426
- However long that may take.
- It could be a week, it could be a year.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.560
- We just don't know.
- Yeah.

24:47.594 --> 24:49.429
We want this to be your
very last way station

24:49.463 --> 24:52.165
ever, ever, ever. Ok?

24:52.199 --> 24:56.336
So, that means, we need to get
you guys out of the living room.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.905
I think you'll be ok to camp
down there one more night,

24:58.939 --> 25:01.140
but tomorrow we're having
some beds delivered,

25:01.175 --> 25:03.009
so after school let's help
get them settled in, ok?

25:03.043 --> 25:06.979
[Stef] Yes, Brandon and Jesus,
could use a little muscle, all right?

25:07.014 --> 25:08.915
Jude, my sweet, new, young friend.

25:08.949 --> 25:10.950
You'll be moving in with Jesus.

25:10.984 --> 25:16.556
And Callie, you'll be moving
into Mariana's room, all right?

25:18.946 --> 25:20.517
Hey Mariana! Lexi is here!

25:26.384 --> 25:28.235
Hey.

25:28.269 --> 25:29.636
Oh, hey.

25:29.654 --> 25:32.439
I just wanted to say thanks.

25:32.474 --> 25:34.274
I know you were just
trying to stick up for me.

25:34.309 --> 25:36.276
I... I didn't mean to yell at you.

25:38.112 --> 25:40.113
You didn't have to go
all Iron Man on his ass,

25:40.148 --> 25:44.051
but, you know, thank you.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.767
What are you doing? Come
on, I need your help.

26:00.802 --> 26:02.536
I have to get rid of a bunch of stuff

26:02.570 --> 26:04.721
so Callie can move into my
room. It's a freaking nightmare.

26:04.756 --> 26:06.807
Seriously, I don't understand why

26:06.841 --> 26:08.542
they just can't move into the dining room?

26:08.576 --> 26:10.444
It's not like we ever use it, right?

26:10.478 --> 26:11.712
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:11.746 --> 26:13.280
Maybe we can put them in the closet

26:13.314 --> 26:15.582
or under the stairs, like in Harry Potter?

26:15.617 --> 26:17.484
I mean, come on guys. Let's
think about how they must feel.

26:17.519 --> 26:19.520
They're not here forever. Let's try to
make them feel a little more welcome.

26:19.554 --> 26:22.089
Easy for you to say. You're
not giving up anything.

26:30.098 --> 26:32.833
Lexi, come here.

26:53.588 --> 26:56.723
Wait, what do you mean? I thought
you weren't getting grounded?

26:56.758 --> 27:00.393
What about Callie? If you're getting
punished, is she going back to juvie?

27:00.411 --> 27:03.380
No. No, she's actually going to
be living with us for a while now.

27:05.516 --> 27:08.252
Wait... you're not jealous, are you?

27:08.286 --> 27:10.337
Of Callie? No.

27:10.371 --> 27:13.223
Ok. 'Cause you have no reason to be.

27:13.258 --> 27:16.076
Yeah, obviously. You know,
that's cool of your moms.

27:16.110 --> 27:17.327
Letting her stay.

27:17.362 --> 27:19.913
She was just trying to help
save her brother, right?

27:19.931 --> 27:21.949
Yeah.

27:26.821 --> 27:28.922
Brandon called you, right?

27:28.956 --> 27:31.858
- Yeah, said he was sorry.
- Good.

27:33.728 --> 27:34.878
He was kind of right, though.

27:34.929 --> 27:37.764
No, he was not. He was
not right to talk to you...

27:37.799 --> 27:40.751
Not about the me not caring part.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.670
I mean, look, when was the
last time that you and Lena

27:43.688 --> 27:46.673
really talked to me about Brandon?

27:46.708 --> 27:49.576
[Sighs] Ok, listen, Mike.
You're right. We have...

27:49.611 --> 27:51.428
No, no, no. I'm not blaming you.

27:51.479 --> 27:54.314
I'm not saying it's your
fault. That's not what I mean.

27:54.349 --> 27:57.617
You guys are so good and
involved and there all the time.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.404
I just feel like it was so
easy to turn the reins over.

28:00.438 --> 28:02.355
I don't want to do that any more, Stef.

28:02.373 --> 28:04.191
I don't want to hand my kid over.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.460
I don't want to be some
half-assed version of a dad.

You're not a half-assed version of a dad.

got out of juvie, right?

28:25.847 --> 28:28.682
Kelsey, I told you not to tell anyone.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.517
I know, but I think that they should know.

28:30.551 --> 28:32.486
Watch out, she'll totally
shiv you or something.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.454
- Shank.
- Huh?

28:34.489 --> 28:36.707

shank's what you do with it.

- Oh.
- My mom's a cop.

crazy couple of days for you.

29:03.251 --> 29:05.168
Uh, no, I'm fine. Thanks.

were talking to this morning?

guys gonna be here for?

get you in some clubs.

out with Brandon all the time.

you... stole Jesus's pills?

at school? Is this true?

- No.
- You sure about that?

student say that you did?

- You don't?

- Well, I didn't tell them that it was you,

38:45.786 --> 38:48.588
I was feeling like a freak.

38:48.622 --> 38:51.424
Just tired being the kid with add.

38:51.459 --> 38:54.160
Everyone always asking me,
"did you take your pill?"

38:54.195 --> 38:56.563
"Did you take your pill?"
You know, so I stopped.

38:56.597 --> 38:59.432
I started hiding them in my pocket.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.368
Kelsey saw them at school

39:01.402 --> 39:04.004
and she told me she heard
they make you really smart,

39:04.038 --> 39:06.039
and really focused.

39:06.073 --> 39:08.108
She needed some for a
paper she had to write.

39:08.142 --> 39:11.277
So, I gave her one.

39:11.312 --> 39:13.213
And some more.

39:13.247 --> 39:16.950
And things just got out of hand.

39:24.592 --> 39:28.495
- [Strumming]
- G, C...

39:29.897 --> 39:31.631
Hey Brandon,

39:31.665 --> 39:33.500
will you excuse us for a sec?

39:33.534 --> 39:35.485
Uh, yeah.

39:39.473 --> 39:41.391
Um, well...

39:41.442 --> 39:43.693
it would appear that we were given

39:43.744 --> 39:46.346
some false information.

39:46.380 --> 39:50.367
And I promise I'm going to find
out how that happened exactly.

39:50.401 --> 39:53.520
Yeah, we're very sorry
that we didn't believe you.

39:53.554 --> 39:59.325
We feel that trust is
something that has to be earned.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.861
Right?

40:03.297 --> 40:06.032
We would really like
to start earning yours.

40:06.067 --> 40:08.902
- Yeah.
- Ok.

40:09.970 --> 40:12.672
All right. Let's go.

40:16.010 --> 40:19.546
I'm glad we're staying. I like it here.

40:19.580 --> 40:20.880
Yeah?

40:21.882 --> 40:23.733
Don't like it too much.

40:30.491 --> 40:31.758
[Beep]

40:37.731 --> 40:39.399
[Laughs]

40:41.735 --> 40:45.271
[Strumming]

40:45.306 --> 40:48.308
[Playing keyboard]

40:50.511 --> 40:52.545
God, I can't remember anything.

40:52.580 --> 40:55.415
[Laughs] Just keep trying.

40:55.449 --> 40:57.233
I mean, it'll come back.

41:01.455 --> 41:03.156
[Cell phone buzzes]

41:22.176 --> 41:25.829
[Both playing]

41:30.050 --> 41:31.184
