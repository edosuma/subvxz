Up and out!
Up and out!

01:50.895 --> 01:51.896
Good morning, Captain.

01:53.965 --> 01:54.966
What time is it?

01:54.999 --> 01:56.768
Present, Captain Swan.

01:56.801 --> 01:58.335
You grumpy boy.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.037
Able seaman Bonnie Swenson?

02:00.071 --> 02:01.806
Present, Captain Swan.

02:01.839 --> 02:04.641
Able seaman Coughie Swenson.

02:04.675 --> 02:07.011
- Where's Coughie?
- I'll get him.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.579
Present, Captain Swan!

02:09.613 --> 02:11.749
Excellent.
Everyone accounted for.

02:15.987 --> 02:18.990
That's fine.
Everyone in the car.

02:22.727 --> 02:25.763
We're off to inquire
as to the cost of our vessel.

02:30.868 --> 02:32.569
- Guess not.
- Shut it!

02:39.844 --> 02:43.047
Land ahoy! Land ho!

02:43.881 --> 02:47.484
- Is this the spot, Captain?
- Looks like the spot, Bon-Bon.

02:47.517 --> 02:49.687
- Mm-hm.
- I'll stay with the stuff?

02:49.720 --> 02:53.623
- Nobody wants your stuff, Ricky.
- I mean, it's all of our stuff.

02:53.658 --> 02:55.893
Nobody wants
your shitty shit, Rick.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.529
All right, crew.
Rick, get Coughie.

02:59.563 --> 03:01.032
First we'll have
a quick breakfast time.

03:01.065 --> 03:02.632
Uh-huh.

03:04.501 --> 03:06.971
Oh, yeah!

03:11.175 --> 03:12.642
It wasn't Ray, it was me.

03:12.677 --> 03:13.811
Trev, I knew it was you.

03:13.845 --> 03:14.846
Who the hell else
would've eaten it?

03:14.879 --> 03:17.414
- You know it was me...
- Good morning, gentlemen.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.382
We are three souls
in search of a vessel.

03:19.817 --> 03:22.086
- Who are you?
- I'm Captain Swan.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.022
This is my first mate, Rick,
and my able seaman, Bonnie.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.860
- How can we help you?
- We want a boat.

03:28.893 --> 03:30.795
What's the boat for, sweetheart?

03:30.828 --> 03:31.929
Healing.

03:31.963 --> 03:33.430
We need a vessel
that we can sleep on.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.332
One bed's fine.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.399
First of all,
we don't sell boats here.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.002
We keep them here,
we gas them up,

03:38.035 --> 03:39.871
we rent out like a couple.

03:39.904 --> 03:41.571
Uh...

03:41.605 --> 03:43.406
Okay, look, I know a guy
named Terry in Huntington

03:43.440 --> 03:44.909
that could help you out.

03:44.942 --> 03:46.711
I can write you
his address down, but...

03:46.744 --> 03:48.980
even like a tight fit, a
fiberglass Catalina is gonna run

03:49.013 --> 03:50.882
at least, like, four,
four and a half thousand.

03:50.915 --> 03:53.084
- Yeah, with a hole in it.
- At least.

03:53.117 --> 03:53.885
Four and a half thousand...

03:53.918 --> 03:55.887
- Thank you.
- How are we gonna...

03:55.920 --> 03:58.022
Thank you, gentlemen.
Have yourselves a wonderful day.

03:58.055 --> 04:00.624
- Yeah, it was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.159
Four
and a half thousand dollars...

04:02.193 --> 04:03.661
Not a word.

04:04.729 --> 04:06.764
Got a lotta, lotta work to do.

04:07.732 --> 04:11.736
- Lotta, lotta work to do.
- Off we go!

04:12.535 --> 04:15.405
Please get the car fixed.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.875
Lotta, lotta work to do.

- Waffle fries.
- As your captain, no.

06:27.872 --> 06:32.109
And as your dietitian,
definitely not.

06:32.143 --> 06:35.913
- I hope you die.
- Bon-Bon!

06:35.946 --> 06:38.049
Rick, are you gonna
let our able seaman...

06:38.082 --> 06:39.950
- Semen.
- Semen.

06:39.984 --> 06:43.154
Are you gonna let her talk
to your captain like that?

06:44.722 --> 06:46.157
- Ricky.
- What's up?

06:46.190 --> 06:48.325
- You're looking pathetic, mate.
- Come on.

06:48.359 --> 06:50.961
You come on. Every night.

06:50.995 --> 06:53.630
Either get the gal back,
or don't.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.132
- But don't mope.
- I'm not.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.835
She's better off with you
than with that pig Coco.

06:57.868 --> 06:59.770
Coco can eat a bag of...

06:59.804 --> 07:01.939
- Hey, guys.
- Darla, my love.

07:01.972 --> 07:04.775
- Hey, girl.
- What's up, girl?

07:04.809 --> 07:07.644
- Hey, Rick.
- Yo.

07:07.678 --> 07:08.879
So what can I get for you, guys?

07:08.913 --> 07:10.214
What you got?

07:10.247 --> 07:12.783
I got Mello Yello,
Blueberry Kush...

07:12.817 --> 07:15.119
Anything else?

07:16.754 --> 07:18.189
See Coco.

07:19.390 --> 07:22.126
- So... Mello.
- Blueberry.

07:22.159 --> 07:24.829
If we're getting Blueberry,
then we're getting waffle fries.

07:25.329 --> 07:27.765
Deal. And waffles fries.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.735
- 30? 20?
- 40.

07:31.769 --> 07:33.237
Rick, give the lady 40.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.005
- Um...
- Come on, give it up.

07:36.140 --> 07:37.908
It's okay
if we crash here tonight?

07:37.942 --> 07:39.677
Yeah, you know
my dad doesn't care.

07:41.212 --> 07:43.714
That lady fucking waving.
One second!

07:44.748 --> 07:46.217
Waffle fries coming right up.

07:48.252 --> 07:50.421
Rick, you gotta go see Coco.

07:50.454 --> 07:52.423
- Why doesn't Bonnie go?
- I don't mind.

07:52.456 --> 07:55.226
We're not sending our
little baby sis to a drug den.

07:55.259 --> 07:57.895
- His mom's basement.
- Look at her, how cute she is.

07:57.928 --> 07:59.430
He lives in his mom's basement.

07:59.463 --> 08:00.865
I think
he fancies Bon-Bon.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.666
- No.
- I do.

08:02.700 --> 08:06.303
- Why don't you go see Coco?
- That's going to happen.

08:08.005 --> 08:09.140
What did we make today?

08:10.174 --> 08:13.811
Not a lot.
Like, uh, 60 after the beer...

08:13.844 --> 08:15.913
Okay, so 45 to the boat,

08:15.946 --> 08:18.349
and 15 to waffle fries
and the lovely lady's tip.

08:18.382 --> 08:21.418
No. There's 20 left
after the weed, man.

08:21.452 --> 08:24.188
No tip. Tomorrow will be better.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.091
Let's go get lovely
for these waffle fries, huh?

08:27.124 --> 08:29.393
- Yes, Captain!
- I'm gonna get ready for sleep.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.861
- Night, Ricky.
- Night.

08:32.496 --> 08:34.865
You did good today, brother.

08:34.899 --> 08:37.400
Thanks. Night.

08:46.744 --> 08:49.046
Save some for your captain, huh?
Give it here.

08:49.847 --> 08:51.782
We need to be making
more money, Captain.

08:53.984 --> 08:56.220
- Tomorrow will be better.
- What's tomorrow?

08:58.155 --> 08:59.890
- Go to the mall!
- No.

09:00.424 --> 09:02.026
We can never go back
to the mall.

09:02.927 --> 09:04.395
Are the walkies charged?

09:04.428 --> 09:06.263
- House-hop?
- Hmm...

09:07.831 --> 09:10.301
While all the little kiddies
are at school,

09:10.334 --> 09:13.070
<i>and the buzzing bees
are hard at work,</i>

09:13.103 --> 09:14.972
<i>we shall take the honey</i>

09:15.005 --> 09:17.408
<i>from their unguarded
little honeypots.</i>

09:22.913 --> 09:26.850
- Okay, come on out.
- <i>Copy, coming out now.</i>

09:37.328 --> 09:41.899
That was nice and clean, crew.
Rick, how was the take?

09:41.932 --> 09:45.002
The take...
Uh, we got some whisky,

09:45.035 --> 09:47.905
and crackers, bread,

09:47.938 --> 09:51.842
snacks, snacks, some carrots...

09:51.875 --> 09:56.180
- Fuck the carrots. Money, Rick!
- Uh, like 40 bucks.

09:56.213 --> 10:00.351
- Rick, I said get at least 50.
- But there was only 40.

10:00.384 --> 10:02.820
- You only found 40.
- Captain.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.888
No. No, no.
One more house it is.

10:04.922 --> 10:06.523
- Swan.
- That's final.

10:10.928 --> 10:12.529
All right, last one.

10:13.297 --> 10:15.065
- Captain?
- Yes?

10:15.099 --> 10:17.968
- You wanna do one?
- The captain drives the ship.

10:18.002 --> 10:19.937
- I could do one, Rick.
- No, it's okay.

10:20.571 --> 10:22.139
- You got your walkie?
- Yeah.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.394
- Hi there. You must be Mark.
- Hey.

10:43.427 --> 10:45.296
- You're Mark?
- Uh, no.

10:45.329 --> 10:47.164
I'm sorry, it's been
a long day of seeing people.

10:47.197 --> 10:49.233
- What's your name?
- Rick.

10:49.266 --> 10:51.268
You're here for the nanny
position, I presume?

10:52.403 --> 10:55.105
- Yeah.
- Okay, Rick, I'm Jim Davies.

10:55.139 --> 10:57.074
You can call me Jim.
It's very nice to meet you.

10:57.107 --> 10:58.609
Very nice to meet you.

10:58.642 --> 11:01.211
Let's talk, shall we?
Come on in.

11:02.346 --> 11:04.415
Sit your behind down, Ricky.

11:04.448 --> 11:05.883
Can I get you
something to drink?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.484
- Uh, I'm fine.
- No, I insist.

11:07.518 --> 11:08.919
How about a glass of lemonade?

11:08.952 --> 11:10.387
- Uh...
- Sit, sit.

11:10.421 --> 11:12.323
One moment.
Lemonade's all right?

11:12.356 --> 11:13.424
Yup.

11:17.494 --> 11:19.096
Are you hungry?

11:19.129 --> 11:22.166
- Uh, no, thank you.
- You sure?

11:24.301 --> 11:25.936
What are we talking?

11:25.969 --> 11:27.371
I made a blueberry pie
last night.

11:27.404 --> 11:30.107
I've got a ton leftover
to get rid of.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.308
Sounds good.

11:37.481 --> 11:39.149
There you go.

11:41.218 --> 11:42.886
Cheers.

11:44.421 --> 11:46.256
So, Ricky,
did you bring me a resume?

11:46.290 --> 11:49.626
Um... No, just me.

11:49.661 --> 11:51.862
Oh, you know,
normally it's customary to...

11:53.497 --> 11:56.200
Uh, well, do you have experience
taking care of children?

11:57.669 --> 11:59.069
Yeah.

11:59.103 --> 12:01.271
Could you provide me
with some references?

12:02.206 --> 12:03.340
How do you mean?

12:03.374 --> 12:06.043
Parents of the families
you've worked for as a nanny.

12:06.076 --> 12:08.011
- Phone numbers.
- Uh...

12:08.045 --> 12:09.480
No, that wouldn't be possible.

12:11.348 --> 12:15.219
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Okay. Pie's real good.

12:15.252 --> 12:17.421
Why can't you give me
phone numbers?

12:18.589 --> 12:20.557
Because they're... they're dead.

12:22.727 --> 12:24.428
Who were you nannying for?

12:24.461 --> 12:26.530
Well, my brother
and sister and I,

12:26.563 --> 12:28.165
I guess we kind
of nannied each other.

12:29.299 --> 12:31.969
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your parents passed?

12:32.670 --> 12:35.939
Yeah. Well, my adoptive parents.

12:36.674 --> 12:39.510
When did they pass away?
If you don't mind me asking.

12:40.277 --> 12:44.982
Well, my dad, recent-ish.
Like two years ago.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.419
And I don't remember his, uh...
My mom.

12:48.452 --> 12:50.554
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

12:50.587 --> 12:53.123
That's really tough.

12:53.157 --> 12:56.560
So the position would be
a full-time live-in situation

12:56.593 --> 12:58.262
where you would stay
with us overnight

12:58.295 --> 12:59.697
Sunday through Thursday.

12:59.731 --> 13:01.632
- Are you a student?
- No.

13:01.666 --> 13:05.102
Great. So I leave every morning
on weekdays at 6:00 a.m.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.037
Your duties throughout the day
would be

13:07.070 --> 13:10.340
to prepare meals for Cookie,
make sure he's ready for school,

13:10.374 --> 13:12.042
walk him to school,
and then just...

13:12.075 --> 13:14.244
His name's Cookie?

13:14.278 --> 13:16.280
- Yes.
- You named him that?

13:16.313 --> 13:20.718
No, his mother
was an unusual character, she...

13:20.752 --> 13:23.353
May she rest in peace.

13:23.387 --> 13:27.024
- How old is Cookie?
- Fifteen, turning sixteen.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.525
You want me
to walk him to school?

13:29.626 --> 13:33.197
Um, he's been going
through a rough time lately.

13:34.298 --> 13:37.067
- Kids pick on him?
- No, nothing like that. It's...

13:37.669 --> 13:41.338
His father... My partner, Bob,

13:42.139 --> 13:44.408
passed away
a month and a half ago.

13:44.441 --> 13:47.177
And we've both been dealing
with it, but he's young,

13:47.211 --> 13:50.414
and so obviously he's really
having a difficult time.

13:50.447 --> 13:52.149
I bet.

13:52.182 --> 13:54.318
I know he can walk
to school on his own.

13:54.351 --> 13:56.620
It's just he refuses
to talk to a grief counselor,

13:56.654 --> 14:00.123
and I wish I could be here
for him all the time,

14:00.157 --> 14:04.094
but my job is very demanding,
and now I'm the sole provider.

14:06.330 --> 14:08.700
And I don't mean
to dump all of this on you.

14:08.733 --> 14:10.501
No, it's fine. Go on.

14:12.302 --> 14:14.271
Thank you. Uh...

14:14.304 --> 14:15.673
It's just that's the situation,

14:15.707 --> 14:17.675
and I wanted
to be upfront about it.

14:18.843 --> 14:22.513
- That's hard.
- It is. Um...

14:24.381 --> 14:27.384
Bob was a... a great father.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.321
He looks real nice.

14:32.356 --> 14:33.490
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.661
Oh, that's Cookie now.

14:38.595 --> 14:39.630
Hey, guy!

14:40.531 --> 14:41.666
This is Rick.

14:42.734 --> 14:44.736
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:44.769 --> 14:46.570
Rick might be taking
the position of nanny

14:46.603 --> 14:48.539
that we talked about.

14:48.572 --> 14:50.641
Why don't you show him
around the house a little bit?

14:51.743 --> 14:54.177
Okay. Come with me.

15:07.457 --> 15:12.362
- So... this is my room.
- You really like movies, huh?

15:12.396 --> 15:16.567
Yeah.
I have this pretty cool camera.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.136
My dad gave it to me.
Well, it was my dad's.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.306
- What is it?
- Uh, eight millimeter, you know.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.174
Shoots film. Pretty cool.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.244
Yeah.

15:27.277 --> 15:28.813
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

15:28.846 --> 15:32.316
Actually, let me go show you
my dad's room.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.283
Okay.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.853
Jim's kept it
the same since.

15:36.754 --> 15:39.289
My dad was paranoid.
He did lots of weird stuff.

15:39.323 --> 15:40.490
What kind of stuff?

15:43.594 --> 15:46.831
He would hear things
and he'd call the police,

15:46.864 --> 15:49.266
and they'd come over,
and Jim would cook,

15:49.299 --> 15:51.435
and we'd all eat. Cops too.

15:51.468 --> 15:54.237
- It sounds funny.
- Yeah.

15:54.271 --> 15:56.573
He talked
about nuclear war a lot too.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.241
Scary stuff.

15:58.275 --> 15:59.844
He was always preparing
for the worst.

16:02.346 --> 16:04.247
Let me show you the guest room
where you'd be staying.

16:10.487 --> 16:12.790
Whoa, I'd sleep here?

16:12.824 --> 16:14.792
Yeah. This would be your room.

16:18.863 --> 16:23.200
Ooh... Yeah, that's comfy.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.636
This room's just empty?

16:25.670 --> 16:27.137
Yeah, it's our guest room.

16:28.505 --> 16:31.408
- It's a big house, man.
- Yeah.

16:34.679 --> 16:38.382
- I gotta go. Um...
- Okay.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.549
- Thanks for the tour.
- Yeah.

16:40.852 --> 16:43.420
Well, it was nice
to meet you guys.

16:43.453 --> 16:44.588
You as well, Ricky.

16:45.657 --> 16:47.959
I think you're a good fit here.
You want the job?

16:47.992 --> 16:51.663
- Yeah, I do.
- Great. Let me have your number.

16:51.696 --> 16:54.866
Um, I actually
gotta get a new phone. I...

16:54.899 --> 16:57.567
No worries.
I have a business card.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.971
Just follow up with me
in a couple of days.

17:00.004 --> 17:01.238
Sounds good.

17:02.006 --> 17:03.640
- Okay. Bye.
- But wait.

17:03.675 --> 17:05.541
- We didn't discuss compensation.
- Oh.

17:05.575 --> 17:07.611
I was thinking
400 dollars a week,

17:07.644 --> 17:10.380
obviously a room to sleep in
and full fridge access.

17:14.317 --> 17:15.819
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

17:16.854 --> 17:18.723
I might've gotten a job.

17:20.357 --> 17:22.993
- What do you mean?
- A nanny job.

17:23.027 --> 17:26.596
- What are you talking about?
- The guy in the house, Jim,

17:26.630 --> 17:28.498
was looking for a nanny
for his kid.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.968
The guy whose house
you were gonna rob?

17:31.002 --> 17:31.936
Yeah.

17:32.770 --> 17:34.504
- Well, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

17:34.538 --> 17:37.809
- Are you gonna do it?
- I'd like to.

17:38.710 --> 17:43.413
Rick, we need to stick together
and focus right now.

17:43.447 --> 17:44.882
We're doing something here.

17:44.916 --> 17:47.885
It's critical
that we remain as one.

17:47.919 --> 17:49.787
- The boat.
- Yes, Ricky.

17:49.821 --> 17:51.789
I mean, I'd be making money.

17:53.024 --> 17:55.425
- How much?
- Like 400 a week.

17:57.962 --> 18:00.297
We'll talk about this later.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.767
- I mean, 400 a week. That's...
- No.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.534
I'd be able to steal food
and feed all of us.

18:04.568 --> 18:06.269
- No.
- And there's a bedroom

18:06.303 --> 18:07.939
where I could sneak you guys in,
I was thinking.

18:07.972 --> 18:09.506
- No.
- No?

18:09.539 --> 18:11.408
It could be fun.
A bed would be nice.

18:11.441 --> 18:12.777
- Yeah.
- Who's the captain here?

18:12.810 --> 18:14.377
Do captains sleep in diners?

18:14.411 --> 18:15.913
Yeah, I don't wanna sleep
in the diner anymore.

18:15.947 --> 18:17.949
We don't always sleep
in the diner.

18:17.982 --> 18:19.884
I don't wanna sleep
in the fucking car either, man.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.351
We could all cuddle.

18:21.384 --> 18:22.987
Yeah. When's the last time
we all cuddled?

18:23.020 --> 18:25.522
- It has been some time.
- Well, he just wants to cuddle.

18:25.555 --> 18:27.457
Yeah, just wanna cuddle.
Come here.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.293
We'll try it out.

18:30.327 --> 18:32.897
Now, I don't want to talk
about this for another minute.

18:32.930 --> 18:35.833

21:17.995 --> 21:21.732

21:22.499 --> 21:26.704
Selling shit is on the way out.
It's music, man.

21:26.737 --> 21:29.840
Me and Phil, we're
onto some next level shit, dawg.

21:29.874 --> 21:31.242
- Yeah?
- Assuredly.

21:32.575 --> 21:34.779
I know Swan is sniffing

21:34.812 --> 21:36.948
and shnarffing

21:36.981 --> 21:38.648
I shouldn't
be giving you nothing.

21:38.683 --> 21:40.583
- Yeah, I know, man.
- He got a debt.

21:40.617 --> 21:42.253
He gotta give me my money.

21:42.286 --> 21:43.921
Yeah, man. Definitely. I agree.

21:45.122 --> 21:48.960
I mean... Or you could just,
like, bring your sister by.

21:49.927 --> 21:51.095
Uh...

Yo, Phil's making the beats,

22:15.086 --> 22:17.121
Yo, he wants you to call him
Philostein from now on.

22:17.154 --> 22:18.923
- That's cool, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:18.956 --> 22:22.860
We got this girl Flo
singing all our hooks. Flo.

22:22.893 --> 22:25.730
She got that junk in the trunk
just like I love.

22:27.131 --> 22:28.733
I thought you were with Darla.

22:29.667 --> 22:31.601
Yeah. Yeah, no, yeah.

22:32.269 --> 22:34.305
Yeah, Flo, just...
She's just singing, man.

22:34.338 --> 22:36.639
You know, like... You know.

22:36.674 --> 22:39.110

But Darla, yeah, yeah.

22:44.215 --> 22:47.118

22:47.151 --> 22:50.121

And now you chilling again,
and I just...

22:52.289 --> 22:54.959
don't want there

22:54.992 --> 22:56.660
I don't want any drama either.

22:57.594 --> 22:59.063
Good. Good.

23:00.698 --> 23:01.832
What you want?

23:01.866 --> 23:03.768

23:05.269 --> 23:07.171

23:07.204 --> 23:09.907

23:09.940 --> 23:12.309
Yo, you wanna hear the new tune

23:12.343 --> 23:15.112

Like there's no fucking way,
man.

25:05.823 --> 25:07.992
She don't give a shit
about the music, yo.

25:08.025 --> 25:09.727
You remember
when I first came here, man?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.029
I came in here looking
for some fucking dope,

25:12.062 --> 25:14.031
I didn't have nothing,
and what did you say to me?

25:14.064 --> 25:17.868
I said,
"No money, no fuckin dope."

25:17.902 --> 25:20.371
Yeah, exactly,
and what'd I say to you?

25:20.404 --> 25:23.174
You said, "What's up
with this microphone and shit?"

25:23.207 --> 25:26.443
Yeah, man. Fucking music history

25:26.477 --> 25:29.380
happening right the fuck
before your eyes, motherfucker.

25:29.413 --> 25:32.016
And your mom thinks I don't
give a fuck about the music?

25:32.049 --> 25:34.084
Look, maybe I don't have
a place to stay,

25:34.118 --> 25:36.487
you might not have a producer,
but we got both those things.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.055
Yeah.

25:38.088 --> 25:39.323
We got both
of those fucking things.

25:39.356 --> 25:40.891
So fuck your mom. We're good.

25:40.925 --> 25:42.259
- We got this.
- Fuck yeah!

25:42.293 --> 25:43.827
Your Mom
can suck my fucking dick.

25:43.861 --> 25:45.496
- Fuck that bitch!
- Yo. Yo, yo, yo.

25:45.529 --> 25:47.798
I can sleep wherever I want.

25:47.831 --> 25:50.734
I can sleep here,
I can sleep on the street.

25:50.768 --> 25:53.237
I choose to sleep here.
I can eat whatever the fuck...

25:53.270 --> 25:55.306
Don't worry him.
He's fucking...

25:55.339 --> 25:57.341
He's fucking up and down
like that all the time.

25:57.374 --> 25:58.909
- Yeah?
- This art shit.

25:59.410 --> 26:01.312
I feel like I can be good
for my planet.

26:01.345 --> 26:03.514
You know what I mean?
Like, good for the Earth.

26:03.547 --> 26:05.249
Mother Earth.

26:05.282 --> 26:08.085
That's my mama, man.
That's my fucking mama.

26:09.286 --> 26:11.255
- Give me 200.
- Yeah.

26:12.122 --> 26:14.191
You know what I mean?
Like... Like...

26:14.225 --> 26:17.428
Like mankind be like any
regular motherfucker dude, man.

26:17.461 --> 26:20.030
You know what I mean?
Like... Like philosophers say,

26:20.064 --> 26:22.032
like, every bitch wanna fuck
their daddy,

26:22.066 --> 26:24.134
every homie wanna fuck his mama.

26:24.168 --> 26:26.170
Deadass, you know what I mean?
So it's like...

26:26.203 --> 26:28.239
It's like it makes sense
for mankind

26:28.272 --> 26:30.241
to wanna fuck Mother Earth.

26:30.274 --> 26:32.243
But, like,
I just hate sitting back

26:32.276 --> 26:34.411
and watching motherfuckers
fuck Mama on the regular,

26:34.445 --> 26:36.113
you know what I'm saying?

26:36.146 --> 26:38.415
Oh, fuck. God.

26:39.350 --> 26:40.551
Yeah.

26:40.584 --> 26:42.920
You know? Fuck!

26:43.821 --> 26:47.458
Yeah, man.

26:47.491 --> 26:49.560
All right.
Yo, get the fuck out of here.

26:49.593 --> 26:50.961
Let me do my art, son.

26:54.965 --> 26:57.067
- You wanna order a pizza?
- I'm sick of pizza.

26:57.101 --> 26:59.803
- Sick of pizza? Woah.
- How about eggs?

26:59.837 --> 27:01.238
- Breakfast for dinner?
- Yeah.

27:01.272 --> 27:02.840
- B-4-D?
- B-4-D.

27:02.873 --> 27:04.475
All right. Uh, you get the eggs.

27:04.508 --> 27:06.143
- All right.
- Thanks.

27:08.445 --> 27:10.381
- You got any homework?
- No.

27:13.484 --> 27:15.953
- How you like your eggs?
- Scrambled.

27:15.986 --> 27:20.557
All right, scramble them up.
They don't...

27:22.126 --> 27:24.028
They don't give you homework
at private school?

27:24.061 --> 27:25.195
I do it at school.

27:26.964 --> 27:28.399
Homework at school.

27:29.466 --> 27:30.534
Listen, uh...

27:31.502 --> 27:32.903
You know, I didn't do
my homework

27:32.936 --> 27:34.004
when I was in high school.

27:34.038 --> 27:36.473
You know, I just wanted
to play guitar, you know.

27:36.507 --> 27:38.542
You don't have to lie to me.
I don't care.

27:38.575 --> 27:41.512
- No lies. Sorry.
- It's all good, man.

27:41.545 --> 27:42.946
When I was in high school,

27:42.980 --> 27:44.415
I used to lie
to my dad all the time.

27:44.448 --> 27:46.150
Me and my brother
and my sister...

27:47.551 --> 27:49.586
we'd make up field trips
that didn't exist.

27:50.354 --> 27:52.423
We'd make up permission forms,
everything, the whole bit.

27:52.456 --> 27:54.158
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:54.191 --> 27:57.895
Lots of stuff like that.
But I... You know, uh...

27:58.562 --> 28:00.331
I don't know what you wanna do
when you grow up,

28:00.364 --> 28:03.067
but if you do your homework,
you know,

28:03.100 --> 28:07.104
you'll have
a couple more options, you know?

28:07.137 --> 28:08.906
Like if you wanted
go to that movie school,

28:09.506 --> 28:11.141
you're gonna need some grades.

28:12.976 --> 28:14.011
Yeah, you're right.

28:15.512 --> 28:17.414
My dad used to do
my homework with me.

28:19.049 --> 28:21.518
That's a...
That's a pretty cool dad.

28:21.552 --> 28:24.154
- Yeah.
- I could do it with you.

28:25.489 --> 28:28.258
- I didn't bring it home.
- It's cool, man.

28:29.126 --> 28:31.663
No homework tonight. Tomorrow.

28:31.696 --> 28:33.497
- Okay.
- Cool.

28:38.035 --> 28:39.870
Hey, Rick,
you got a minute?

28:40.537 --> 28:41.538
Hey, Jim.

28:41.572 --> 28:43.107
Hey, Ricky,
did I wake you up?

28:43.140 --> 28:45.175
- Um, no, uh...
- Can't sleep?

28:45.209 --> 28:47.478
I'm fine.

28:48.645 --> 28:51.115
What...

28:51.148 --> 28:52.116
Hey, you know,

28:53.250 --> 28:55.119
before you came around,
I was sleeping on this bed.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.287
- Yeah?
- It was weird.

28:57.321 --> 29:00.057
- It's still weird.
- Yeah, I bet.

29:00.090 --> 29:02.893
- What's... What's up?
- Oh...

29:03.661 --> 29:05.529
I haven't been travelling
in the last few weeks

29:05.562 --> 29:08.198
for work, um,
because of obvious reasons,

29:08.232 --> 29:10.067
but now it's time for me
to get back to it.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.935
And I know it's short notice,

29:11.969 --> 29:15.472
but I have to go to India
tomorrow for two weeks.

29:15.506 --> 29:17.441
So I need you to stay

29:17.474 --> 29:19.410
this weekend
and the next weekend.

29:19.443 --> 29:21.412
- Okay.
- And I'll pay you double. 800?

29:21.445 --> 29:24.014
- Sure.
- And um... Great.

29:24.047 --> 29:26.016
Uh,
so you leave tomorrow.

29:26.049 --> 29:26.785
Yeah.

29:28.118 --> 29:30.454
Actually, today.

29:31.155 --> 29:32.489
I've talked to Cookie

29:32.523 --> 29:34.324
and I told him
that I'll try to be back

29:34.358 --> 29:36.026
this Saturday
before Cookie's birthday.

29:36.059 --> 29:37.594
- Uh-huh.
- I'll definitely be back

29:37.628 --> 29:40.197
for Cookie's birthday
on that Sunday.

29:40.230 --> 29:43.634
So why don't I just pay you
now for this week...

29:43.668 --> 29:44.903
Okay, sure.

29:44.935 --> 29:48.105
Actually, I'll just pay you
for next week up front as well.

29:48.138 --> 29:49.506
- Great.
- Great.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.942
Uh, I'll be right back.

29:55.145 --> 29:57.648
- My god, we're gonna be rich!
- Shh!

29:58.315 --> 30:00.317
He has that kind of cash
just lying around?

30:00.350 --> 30:02.352
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

30:02.386 --> 30:04.621
- Captain.
- Captain. Shh!

30:05.757 --> 30:08.192
So here you go. Here's 1200,

30:08.225 --> 30:10.594
and there's some petty cash
there as well.

30:10.627 --> 30:12.362
- Again, thank you so much.
- Yeah, no problem.

30:13.063 --> 30:17.000
- All right, I'm off. Goodnight.
- Good night. Have a good trip.

30:40.324 --> 30:42.694
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:44.328 --> 30:46.530
I'm Bonnie. Rick's sister.

30:47.231 --> 30:49.600
Okay. The door was unlocked.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.403
- Oh, you're Cookie.
- Yeah.

30:53.437 --> 30:55.506
Oh, Rick's told us
so much about you.

30:55.539 --> 30:58.475
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

31:00.544 --> 31:01.746
Who is that guy?

31:02.446 --> 31:04.414
That's our big brother, Swan.

31:05.249 --> 31:06.751
We're not supposed to be here,
huh?

31:07.685 --> 31:10.254
I don't mind. Jim's not here.

31:13.658 --> 31:16.260
Come on. Come here.

31:21.098 --> 31:24.736
- Ooh, I'm starving. You hungry?
- Um, I'm late for class.

31:24.769 --> 31:26.738
- How late?
- School started at 9:00.

31:27.739 --> 31:29.206
Hmm.

31:29.239 --> 31:31.575
His step-father, yes.

31:31.608 --> 31:34.111
Oh, Cookie's feeling
quite sick today.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.246
I think
it's in his best interest...

31:36.280 --> 31:38.615
...to stay home and rest.

31:38.649 --> 31:41.819
Uh-huh. Oh, thank you.

31:41.853 --> 31:44.221
Oh, don't...
don't bother with the homework.

31:44.254 --> 31:46.223
We'll just have
to catch up on that

31:46.256 --> 31:48.258
when he's feeling better.

31:48.292 --> 31:52.162
Okay. Thank you. Goodbye then.

31:52.195 --> 31:54.197
Badda-boom!

31:54.231 --> 31:55.733
Badda-boom! This is awesome!

31:55.767 --> 31:57.267
Why? You've never skipped
before?

31:57.301 --> 31:58.736
- Never.
- I think it's fine.

31:58.770 --> 32:00.604
Have a nice day off.

32:00.637 --> 32:02.205
You wanna make
breakfast for the boys?

32:02.239 --> 32:04.107
- Yeah.
- Come on.

32:07.578 --> 32:10.782
One, two, three.

32:10.815 --> 32:13.350
Rise and shine!

32:13.383 --> 32:14.518
- What?
- What is this?

32:16.253 --> 32:17.554
Bonnie.

32:17.588 --> 32:19.456
- We made you guys breakfast.
- Bonnie.

32:19.489 --> 32:20.692
It's okay.

32:20.725 --> 32:22.860
- What time is it?
- 11:00.

32:22.894 --> 32:26.129
Shit. Okay, okay.
Give me two minutes, okay?

32:26.163 --> 32:27.799
And I'll get ready,
and we'll take you to school.

32:27.832 --> 32:30.167
- Okay, buddy?
- Oh, we called the school.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.235
- What?
- Tsk. Cookie's sick.

32:32.269 --> 32:34.839
- What?
- Show him, Cookie.

32:34.872 --> 32:37.709
So sick.

32:37.742 --> 32:41.244
Uh, Cookie,
can you give me and Bonnie

32:41.278 --> 32:43.246
a minute alone
to talk about this, okay?

32:43.280 --> 32:44.414
- Cookie, you're fine.
- Buddy?

32:44.448 --> 32:45.917
What's the problem?

32:45.950 --> 32:48.185
Well, Bonnie went
and introduced herself to Cookie

32:48.218 --> 32:49.854
while we were sleeping
and called the school

32:49.887 --> 32:51.254
and told them he was sick.

32:51.288 --> 32:53.490
You slept in, he was late! Ah!

32:53.523 --> 32:56.360
- Jim usually wakes me up.
- Well, I fixed it.

32:56.393 --> 32:58.528
- Rick, it's my fault.
- No, it's not your fault.

32:58.562 --> 33:01.565
No, no, no.
Nothing is no one's fault.

33:01.598 --> 33:03.367
Nothing is wrong.

33:05.770 --> 33:08.706
Cookie, you've met
my first mate, Rick,

33:08.740 --> 33:10.607
my able seaman, Bonnie.

33:10.641 --> 33:13.543
I'm Captain Swan
of the untimely S.S. Swenson.

33:13.577 --> 33:15.445
- Like a boat?
- Yes.

33:15.479 --> 33:18.448
- You guys have a boat?
- No. Not yet.

33:18.482 --> 33:20.852
- I don't...
- In good time.

33:20.885 --> 33:24.287
- Are you a smart Cookie?
- I get good grades.

33:24.856 --> 33:27.357
- Are you strong?
- I don't know.

33:27.391 --> 33:29.192
Hit me.

33:34.631 --> 33:37.267
Well... he's no Popeye.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.836
You guys want me
part of your crew?

33:38.870 --> 33:41.505
Maybe. You ever kissed
a woman, Cookie?

33:41.538 --> 33:43.473
We made you guys breakfast.
Come on.

33:43.507 --> 33:45.275
Come on, it's gonna get cold.

33:45.308 --> 33:47.477
- Ooh, you can cook?
- A little. Not really.

33:47.511 --> 33:49.479
- Excellent. Let's eat.
- Swan.

33:49.513 --> 33:51.415
Come on, Rick.
Breakfast for breakfast.

33:51.448 --> 33:53.751
- Yeah, buddy. B-4-B.
- Come on, Cookie.

33:53.785 --> 33:55.485
B-4-B!

33:57.320 --> 33:58.923
This feels wrong.

33:58.956 --> 34:01.993
You said his dad passed away.
Just like our papa.

34:02.026 --> 34:04.561
- Yes.
- Does he have friends?

34:04.594 --> 34:06.363
Well, he said
that for his birthday,

34:06.396 --> 34:08.331
he wanted go to the movies
just me and him, so...

34:08.364 --> 34:09.934
No, I think I'm his only friend.

34:09.967 --> 34:13.335
- When's his birthday?
- Two weeks on Sunday.

34:13.370 --> 34:15.806
So the kid takes
two weeks off school.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.308
His fucking dad died.

34:18.341 --> 34:20.945
Let's help him out,
show him a good time.

34:22.045 --> 34:25.482
- And he could help too.
- How?

34:25.514 --> 34:30.253
- Hmm... I don't know... yet.
- I'm gonna get fired.

34:30.286 --> 34:33.290
No, no, no, no. It'll be...

34:33.322 --> 34:35.358
our little secret, hmm?

34:35.391 --> 34:37.293
Yeah.

34:37.327 --> 34:39.563
Cookie, this was
quite the breakfast.

34:39.596 --> 34:41.565
- Bonnie helped.
- No, no, no.

34:41.598 --> 34:43.500
Bon-Bon makes
a good little brekkie,

34:43.533 --> 34:45.569
but nothing quite like this.

34:45.601 --> 34:48.039
I could get used to this.

34:48.072 --> 34:50.273
Cookie...

34:50.306 --> 34:52.476
how would you like to be
resident chef

34:52.509 --> 34:54.444
of the S.S. Swenson?

34:54.478 --> 34:55.980
Sounds good to me.

34:56.013 --> 34:59.984
I just still don't really
understand what it is.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.351
We're a crew.

35:02.987 --> 35:05.555
A family and a tribe.

35:05.589 --> 35:09.026
We have a papa-shaped hole
in our chests just like you.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.394
We've been filling that hole
with just about anything

35:11.428 --> 35:13.563
we can get our hands on
for some time,

35:13.597 --> 35:15.800
with no end
or answer in sight until...

35:17.400 --> 35:19.336
the idea of a boat.

35:19.369 --> 35:20.872
The long and short of it is,

35:20.905 --> 35:22.673
we raise the money
for the vessel,

35:22.707 --> 35:24.508
buy said vessel,

35:24.541 --> 35:27.544
and then set sail
and live the simple life at sea

35:27.577 --> 35:29.814
until our vices
have left our bodies

35:29.847 --> 35:32.582
and we're at peace
with our loss.

35:33.483 --> 35:35.086
- Vices?
- Hmm.

35:35.119 --> 35:36.788
- Filling holes?
- Hmm.

35:37.655 --> 35:40.323
Do you mean you guys do drugs?

35:41.659 --> 35:42.794
Hypothetically.

35:42.827 --> 35:45.663
But drugs are bad.
Don't do drugs.

35:45.696 --> 35:47.464
I smoked a joint once this year.

35:47.497 --> 35:49.599
- Did you now?
- Yeah.

35:49.633 --> 35:50.668
Cookie!

35:50.701 --> 35:53.037
Looks we've a lotta lot to learn
about you, Cookie.

35:54.404 --> 35:58.009
- Welcome aboard, chef.
- Chef Cookie.

35:58.876 --> 36:01.946
So... how do I get started?

36:01.979 --> 36:04.514
I don't know, man.
I don't like it.

36:04.548 --> 36:05.983
I think it's a bad idea.

36:06.017 --> 36:08.085

36:08.119 --> 36:09.954

36:09.987 --> 36:12.056
Are you ready
to bring home the bacon?

36:12.089 --> 36:15.092
- Yeah.
- Okay, so what you do

36:15.126 --> 36:17.460
is you find
someone sitting alone,

36:17.494 --> 36:19.362
you walk up to them
and you say...

36:20.064 --> 36:23.935
<i>"Excuse me, I got mugged,
I need some help.</i>

36:23.968 --> 36:26.938
<i>All I need is some money

36:26.971 --> 36:28.572
You think you can do that?

36:28.605 --> 36:32.677
I think so, yeah.
Can I try a cigarette?

36:32.710 --> 36:35.146
No, you don't wanna smoke, man.
Come on.

36:35.179 --> 36:38.548
Cook, cigs

Pack it in. Bring it in.

38:21.584 --> 38:23.120
Give me some love.

38:25.289 --> 38:27.191

38:45.076 --> 38:47.011
- Give me my smokes!
- I'm trying!

38:47.044 --> 38:50.848
Oh, wow, wow!
Chef, this looks like a delight.

38:50.881 --> 38:54.218
- Breakfast is served.
- Thank you, Cookie.

38:54.251 --> 38:56.087
Ah, I'll see you guys
in a couple of hours.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.688
Where are you headed off to?

38:57.722 --> 38:59.690
I'm gonna go
to my media arts class.

38:59.724 --> 39:01.292
What if they see
that you're not so sickly?

39:01.325 --> 39:03.227
Well, it's
the only class I like.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.996
We have a project,
we're gonna get to make a movie,

39:05.029 --> 39:06.731
so I gotta go.

39:06.764 --> 39:09.566
- Just act diseased.
- Give me your best cough.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.871
Hmm, no, no, no.

39:13.904 --> 39:15.906
You've got a fantastic cough
in there

39:15.940 --> 39:17.775
just dying to come out.

39:17.808 --> 39:19.542
Like this.

39:22.279 --> 39:24.215
Yeah, you've gotta...

39:26.951 --> 39:30.187
Absolutely, Bon-Bon.
What you got, Chef?

39:35.726 --> 39:37.094
What do you think, Coughie?

39:37.128 --> 39:39.629
Pretty dope,
if you ask me.

39:39.663 --> 39:42.632
That's the one.
Send it to print.

39:42.666 --> 39:44.601
So what's this film gonna be?

39:44.634 --> 39:46.704
I don't know yet, I thought
we could make it together.

39:46.737 --> 39:48.906
Hmm, I like it.

39:48.939 --> 39:51.709
We'll discuss later.
Run along to class.

39:51.742 --> 39:54.812
That a lad.

39:59.884 --> 40:02.153
- Ricky.
- What's up? What's up?

40:02.186 --> 40:04.288
What's up?
There's no money left.

40:04.321 --> 40:06.157
There's 40 dollars
in the drawer.

40:06.190 --> 40:08.659
- I thought there was a 100.
- I bought groceries.

40:08.692 --> 40:12.296
Groceries?
Well, now we have no provisions.

40:12.329 --> 40:14.965
I gotta keep the fridge full,
man. I'm the nanny.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.901
What about shnarff-shnarff, huh?

40:16.934 --> 40:19.636
- We'll get money.
- We could sell the microwave.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.138
We could, we could.

40:21.172 --> 40:23.107
No, we already gotta replace
the TV, okay?

40:23.140 --> 40:25.642
Okay, well, the day is young.

40:25.676 --> 40:27.178
Bonnie, are the walkies charged?

40:27.211 --> 40:28.312
- Yes, Captain.
- House-hop.

40:28.345 --> 40:30.014
Let me sleep.

40:30.047 --> 40:32.083
While all the little kiddies
are at school,

40:32.116 --> 40:34.151
and all the buzzing bees
are hard at work...

40:34.185 --> 40:36.654
Okay, okay, okay, I'm up.

40:36.687 --> 40:39.156
Okay, bud?

40:39.190 --> 40:41.659
<i>Yeah, all the rooms.
Coming out now.</i>

40:41.692 --> 40:42.760
Thank you.

40:43.794 --> 40:46.297
What else did he get?
A lot of stuff in here.

40:47.164 --> 40:50.134
Ooh, is that a hat?

40:55.005 --> 40:58.008
Rick, you've got company.
There's a guy at the front door.

40:58.042 --> 41:00.711
- Rick, someone's home!
- Shit.

41:01.278 --> 41:03.280
- Rick!
- <i>What?</i>

41:03.314 --> 41:06.817
- Oh, he's in the basement.
- I know that. Fuck.

41:06.851 --> 41:09.420
Rick, someone is home.

41:09.453 --> 41:13.224
- <i>What do I do?</i>
- I don't know.

41:13.257 --> 41:15.960
I don't know.
Where are you in the house?

41:18.028 --> 41:20.965
<i>I'm in the back now,
but there's no way out.</i>

41:20.998 --> 41:22.833
Where are they?

41:22.867 --> 41:24.702
<i>In the front
of the house.</i>

41:24.735 --> 41:27.705
- Shit.
- Uh...

41:27.738 --> 41:28.939
<i>Start the car.</i>

41:30.241 --> 41:32.443
- What?
- What? What?

41:32.476 --> 41:34.178
That's him,
that's him hanging out.

41:34.211 --> 41:35.346
He's jumping!

41:37.181 --> 41:39.083
Woah!

41:39.116 --> 41:40.718
Come on, come on, come on!

41:44.288 --> 41:46.357
Oh, Jesus Christ, Rick,
you scared us.

41:46.390 --> 41:47.992
You okay, mate?

41:48.025 --> 41:50.361
- Guys, check this out.
- Holy fuck, Rick.

41:50.394 --> 41:52.897
- What?
- Ricky got us a gun.

41:53.864 --> 41:55.733
Oh, mama.

41:55.766 --> 41:57.968
- Throw it in the trunk.
- What do we do with it?

41:58.002 --> 42:00.070
- We'll take it back to Cookie's.
- No, we can't take it there.

42:00.104 --> 42:01.438
I was thinking we could sell it.

42:01.472 --> 42:04.441
Sell it?
God gave us this gun, Ricky.

42:05.309 --> 42:07.144
We'll take it back
to the old house.

42:07.178 --> 42:09.780
- What, you want to go back home?
- You got a better idea?

42:11.148 --> 42:13.484
- What else did we get?
- A bottle of whisky,

42:13.517 --> 42:18.222
a couple of cool sweaters,
uh, some crackers, uh...

42:18.255 --> 42:20.457
A gun. A gun!

42:20.491 --> 42:24.328
A gun! Gun! Gun!
Gun! Gun! Gun!

42:24.361 --> 42:26.263
Gun!

43:15.112 --> 43:18.215
- I'm hungry.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

43:26.323 --> 43:29.960
- Swan, can I ask you a question?
- Hmm...

43:33.330 --> 43:36.900
Chef, it's my understanding
that your birthday is coming up.

43:36.934 --> 43:38.369
- Yeah.
- When's your birthday?

43:38.402 --> 43:39.436
Sunday.

43:40.604 --> 43:43.307
I thought we'd throw you
a little early birthday party.

43:43.340 --> 43:45.909
- Sounds good, Captain.
- Spread the word.

43:45.943 --> 43:47.911
Well, I don't know
how many people would show up.

43:47.945 --> 43:51.048
- Why not?
- We could just party, just us.

43:51.081 --> 43:53.017
Brilliant, but, but, but...

43:53.050 --> 43:56.053
I did meet one likely candidate
at the grocery store.

43:56.086 --> 43:59.523
I think he will fit right in.
His name's Brad. He's wonderful.

43:59.556 --> 44:02.059
Sounds awesome.
When's Jim getting home?

44:02.092 --> 44:04.962
- Sunday.
- Perfect.

44:04.995 --> 44:07.264
So what's this film
we're making?

44:07.298 --> 44:09.600
Well, I was thinking we could
make it about our crew.

44:09.633 --> 44:12.870
We could call it
<i>The S.S. Swenson?</i>

44:14.004 --> 44:18.142
- I dig that.
- Hmm, hmm... No, no.

44:18.909 --> 44:23.347
<i>The First Voyage
of The Untimely S.S. Swenson.</i>

44:23.380 --> 44:25.382
- Yes!
- Yes!

44:25.416 --> 44:27.084
- That's it.
- Okay!

44:27.117 --> 44:30.554
We have a party to plan.
And a movie to make.

44:30.587 --> 44:33.424
Nay, a film to make!

44:33.457 --> 44:36.360
- A lotta lot to do!
- A lotta lot to do!

45:07.692 --> 45:08.992
<i>What were you doing?</i>

45:09.493 --> 45:13.130
- What? Changing why?
- No reason.

45:15.399 --> 45:17.301
Ah, just a minute!

45:17.334 --> 45:19.937
- Wanking wanker.
- Dibs downstairs.

45:19.970 --> 45:21.138
I gotta pee!

45:28.145 --> 45:29.146
Ahoy!

45:54.371 --> 45:58.242
- Morning.
- Morning, Captain.

46:01.111 --> 46:03.480
- Saw you peeping.
- What?

46:03.514 --> 46:05.582
- Peeping at Bon-Bon.
- I was just...

46:05.616 --> 46:07.652
It's not a big deal.

46:07.685 --> 46:10.354
Don't tell Bonnie.

46:10.387 --> 46:12.089
Your secret is safe.

46:13.157 --> 46:15.192
Speaking of which, I stumbled

46:15.225 --> 46:17.461
upon a little safe
in your pop pop's room.

46:18.328 --> 46:22.132
- What's in it?
- Um, money and stuff.

46:22.166 --> 46:25.536
- Jim has the key, I don't.
- Just curious.

46:26.704 --> 46:29.206
You ready for the party
of your lifetime tonight?

46:29.239 --> 46:31.241
I'm still getting over
last night's party.

46:31.275 --> 46:34.244
Well, had to celebrate
our little film we shot.

46:34.278 --> 46:35.979
I can't wait to put it together.

46:36.447 --> 46:38.649
- Make me look good now.
- Of course.

46:39.383 --> 46:40.517
I threw up.

46:41.686 --> 46:43.721
Out with the old,
in with the new.

47:39.711 --> 47:40.577
Hello.

47:43.580 --> 47:44.716
Hello.

47:47.217 --> 47:49.219
I'm a little lost, Papa.

47:53.190 --> 47:55.492
Fuck. Fuck.

48:05.770 --> 48:07.104
<i>♪ Tada ♪</i>

48:07.137 --> 48:11.241
Oh. Let's get you to bed, boy.

48:11.275 --> 48:13.343
Okay, okay.

48:13.377 --> 48:18.115
I feel like a pussy.
I can't drink like those guys.

48:18.148 --> 48:19.583
You're 15, man.

48:20.617 --> 48:23.287
You'll be more of a man
than those two animals.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.155
You guys party a lot.

48:25.188 --> 48:27.692
Yeah, well, we're gonna stop
once we get the boat.

48:28.358 --> 48:31.729
- Hmm, whose idea was the boat?
- Swan.

48:34.732 --> 48:37.434
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure, hun.

48:37.869 --> 48:39.636
Why does he talk like that?

48:39.671 --> 48:41.673
Swan went
to school in Cambridge,

48:41.706 --> 48:44.641
studied English.

48:44.676 --> 48:46.376
And kinda
came back like that.

48:47.511 --> 48:49.279
So he's, like, faking it?

48:49.313 --> 48:50.547
I would not say that to him,
darling.

48:51.648 --> 48:54.786
He just didn't get a job
when he finished school?

48:54.819 --> 48:56.721
He didn't finish school.

48:57.621 --> 48:59.824
He came back
when our Papa Bear passed away.

48:59.857 --> 49:02.694
- He just dropped out?
- Hmm.

49:03.695 --> 49:07.397
- And then what?
- And then here we are.

49:09.767 --> 49:11.769
Are you gonna go to school?

49:12.737 --> 49:14.906
I will, for art.

49:14.939 --> 49:17.240
To be an artiste.

49:17.274 --> 49:21.411
After the boat trip.

49:24.281 --> 49:26.183
I'm coming on the boat, right?

49:27.317 --> 49:29.754
We need a chef, don't we?

49:30.855 --> 49:33.256
No, that's what I was thinking.

49:48.840 --> 49:52.777
Oh, dude, I thought I was coming
into a nose party.

49:53.610 --> 49:54.746
Sorry.

49:56.814 --> 49:58.515
You still smoke that shit?

49:59.817 --> 50:02.854
A lot less.

50:06.490 --> 50:11.228
This is you
sorting yourself out?

50:13.597 --> 50:15.700
You'd rather be doing

50:15.733 --> 50:18.502
whatever this is
you're doing than...

50:20.838 --> 50:23.206
- ...in San Fran?
- No.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.442
With... With me?

50:26.678 --> 50:29.246
We could've been together here.

50:29.279 --> 50:31.481
I don't want
a cracked-out bum for...

50:31.515 --> 50:32.950
Coco is a fucking cokehead.

50:32.984 --> 50:34.551
- I don't give a fuck about Coco.
- No, he's a...

50:36.020 --> 50:37.989
It's the police.
Open the fuck up!

50:41.025 --> 50:42.794
Who's in the mood
for a sing-along?

50:44.394 --> 50:48.298
Jesus, who died?

50:49.466 --> 50:51.368
Not to be a downer, but...

50:52.369 --> 50:53.971
when you were going
through that stuff

50:54.005 --> 50:55.472
with your dad passing away...

50:56.908 --> 50:58.743
I don't know.

50:58.776 --> 51:00.812
I just feel like I
haven't dealt with it at all.

51:00.845 --> 51:03.447
I'm still working
through it, man.

51:03.480 --> 51:06.383
- How long's it been?
- To give you an idea...

51:07.985 --> 51:09.619
I shaved my head
when it happened.

51:10.888 --> 51:14.291
- Shit.
- Yeah. Little over two years.

51:15.860 --> 51:17.995
- Cookie?
- What?

51:19.329 --> 51:23.333
- Where's your mom?
- I never...

51:24.501 --> 51:26.536
I don't remember her.

51:26.570 --> 51:30.775
- Really? Um...
- She was sick.

51:30.808 --> 51:35.645
Oh, Cookie, I'm sorry.
I don't remember my mama either.

51:36.580 --> 51:39.316
Maybe both our papa's
were seeing the same mama.

51:39.817 --> 51:41.753
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

51:42.619 --> 51:44.989
You're so like us. Oh, fucking...

51:45.723 --> 51:47.424
Tsk, the chances.

51:48.492 --> 51:50.661
That papa-shaped hole
Captain talks about?

51:50.695 --> 51:53.363
- Mmm?
- It's bigger than me.

51:53.396 --> 51:55.867
Oh, you're big, you'll see.

51:55.900 --> 51:58.535
You're gonna be a hotshot
movie director one day.

51:59.569 --> 52:01.304
- What's up?
- Sup?

52:01.338 --> 52:03.340
We're doing sing-alongs
in the living room.

52:04.776 --> 52:08.311
Do we still have the bald cap?
We found the wig.

52:08.345 --> 52:09.781
Yeah, we should.
Check the big pack.

52:10.647 --> 52:13.751
- You okay, bud?
- Yeah, yeah.

52:13.785 --> 52:15.318
Oh.

52:21.391 --> 52:25.395
- We love you, buddy.
- Oh, I love you, guys. Yeah.

52:27.098 --> 52:29.100
- Okay.
- Let's go.

52:29.133 --> 52:30.534
Yes, Captain.

52:33.470 --> 52:34.538
Have fun, lovebirds.

52:35.639 --> 52:37.975
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He's being a loser.

52:38.009 --> 52:41.478
Oh, no,
my sweet paintings, my sweets!

52:41.511 --> 52:43.413
- Are they okay?
- Yeah, they're all right.

52:43.446 --> 52:45.515
I should take better care
of them.

52:46.449 --> 52:47.752
Why do you have all this stuff?

52:47.785 --> 52:49.654
We've carried it everywhere
with us, you know,

52:49.687 --> 52:51.088
before we started crashing here.

52:51.722 --> 52:54.391
- Where did you guys live before?
- Kind of all over.

52:54.424 --> 52:56.426
Well, Darla let us crash
at the diner a lot.

- What the fuck is this, Rick?

57:08.079 --> 57:09.380
- Um...
- "Uh"?

57:11.048 --> 57:13.084
- Explain this to me.
- I'm sorry.

57:13.117 --> 57:16.187
We had
a birthday party for Cookie.

57:17.121 --> 57:18.355
Who's 15.

57:19.423 --> 57:20.623
Yeah.

57:21.624 --> 57:23.794
So... So you had a bunch
of fifteen-year-olds

57:23.828 --> 57:25.729
overdrinking in my house
while I was away

57:25.763 --> 57:27.264
and God knows what else.

57:27.298 --> 57:29.266
- Jesus, Rick.
- Listen, it was... We were um...

57:29.300 --> 57:30.901
Whose car
is that out front?

57:31.302 --> 57:34.138
- My brother's.
- Your... Who else is here?

57:35.005 --> 57:36.907
- My brother and my sister.
- Where's Cookie?

57:36.941 --> 57:38.641
And Cookie's here.
Wait, wait, wait.

57:38.676 --> 57:41.912
Stay right there!

57:52.289 --> 57:53.724
- Get them and go.
- No, wait...

57:53.757 --> 57:56.360
- What?
- Okay, just hear me out.

57:56.393 --> 57:57.962
Okay, go.

57:57.995 --> 58:00.865
I know this looks
really, really bad, okay?

58:00.898 --> 58:03.267
but I care about Cookie,

58:03.300 --> 58:05.169
and I really think
I'm helping him...

58:05.202 --> 58:07.204
Stop, stop.
Rick, you have to go.

58:07.238 --> 58:08.873
I care about him, you know, I...

58:08.906 --> 58:10.708
Get out of my house!

58:12.009 --> 58:12.877
Please.

58:13.978 --> 58:17.848
This is a job, Rick,
and you are fired from this job.

58:17.882 --> 58:19.917
I didn't hire you to be
his friend and help him.

58:19.950 --> 58:22.219
I needed you to be an adult,

58:22.253 --> 58:24.255
not the teenager
who throws the party.

58:25.222 --> 58:26.857
I'm sorry.

58:28.959 --> 58:32.863
Look, you're not a bad kid,
but you're a kid.

58:32.897 --> 58:35.699
And I clearly used bad judgement
in hiring you.

58:35.733 --> 58:37.935
You know,
I've just been so zapped

58:37.968 --> 58:40.971
dealing with everything,
I've been fucking drained.

58:41.005 --> 58:43.941
It has been hell,
and I needed someone,

58:43.974 --> 58:45.943
I need an adult
to help me support this home...

58:45.976 --> 58:48.979
- Jim.
- Cookie, go to your room.

58:49.013 --> 58:50.247
Jim, it's my fault.

58:51.048 --> 58:53.017
Cookie, I need you
to go to your room now.

58:53.918 --> 58:55.252
Is Rick going away?

58:55.286 --> 58:56.787
- Cookie.
- Is Rick going away?

58:56.820 --> 58:58.422
Cookie, do as I say.
I'm not gonna say it again.

58:58.455 --> 59:00.124
- You're not my dad.
- Cookie.

59:00.157 --> 59:02.826
- You're not my fucking dad!
- Cookie, stop!

59:02.860 --> 59:04.762
Look, Rick, just get your stuff.

59:04.795 --> 59:08.065
I need you to let me
deal with this, all right?

59:08.098 --> 59:10.067
It appears we have a quarrel
amongst us.

59:10.100 --> 59:11.869
Fixable, I am sure.

59:11.902 --> 59:13.771
You must be Jim.
It's a pleasure.

59:15.239 --> 59:16.874
Is the pleasure all mine?

59:20.377 --> 59:22.313
- Come on!
- He's just upset.

59:22.346 --> 59:24.515
- I can get through to him.
- Bonnie, open the door.

59:24.548 --> 59:25.916
- I'm telling you.
- Get in the...

59:26.417 --> 59:30.521
Open the door. Get in the car.
Come here.

59:30.554 --> 59:32.256
Is this how you treat
your captain?

59:32.289 --> 59:34.525
Get in the car.
Bonnie, unlock the door.

59:34.558 --> 59:35.559
Open it.

59:37.027 --> 59:40.164
Cookie. Cookie. Cookie.
Cookie, you can't come.

59:40.197 --> 59:41.999
I wanna go with you, guys.

59:42.032 --> 59:43.500
- He's our chef, and we love him.
- You're psychotic.

59:43.534 --> 59:45.169
- Get out of my way.
- I'm psychotic?

59:46.503 --> 59:48.806
- Cookie, come with me.
- I'm going with them!

59:48.839 --> 59:50.474
- Are you okay?
- Asshole.

59:50.507 --> 59:52.476
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

59:52.509 --> 59:55.112
- Cookie!
- Rick, come here!

59:55.145 --> 59:56.814
- Rick, come here!
- I'm done.

59:57.581 --> 59:59.450
- I'm gonna sue you.
- Get out of here!

01:00:00.451 --> 01:00:01.852
I'm gonna sue you!

01:00:04.288 --> 01:00:06.190
- Where are you going?
- Cookie, you have to go back.

01:00:06.223 --> 01:00:07.791
I thought
you were my friend.

01:00:07.825 --> 01:00:09.793
Cookie, I am your friend.
Man, come on.

01:00:09.827 --> 01:00:11.228
I'll never
gonna see you again.

01:00:11.262 --> 01:00:12.830
- You'll see me again.
- When?

01:00:15.899 --> 01:00:17.334
Just...
We'll figure it out, okay?

01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:18.235
But you gotta go back.

01:00:19.403 --> 01:00:21.372
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll miss you, man.

01:00:21.405 --> 01:00:22.406
I'll miss you too.

01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:27.278
See you on the boat, Cook.

01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:39.290
Ricky!
Ricky, it's us, come on.

01:00:40.024 --> 01:00:43.294
Ricky! Don't run away
from your captain!

whatever, wherever he is now.

01:04:07.164 --> 01:04:09.032
Am I a crazy person?

01:04:09.066 --> 01:04:11.168
Of course not,
Bon-Bon.

01:04:11.736 --> 01:04:13.470
I just really miss you, Pop.

01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:18.075
You know?

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:21.578
Oh, I used to have
this shirt of yours.

01:04:21.612 --> 01:04:24.648
It smelled so good.
It smelled just like you.

01:04:25.482 --> 01:04:28.720
I fucking lost it.

01:04:31.321 --> 01:04:34.759
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:04:35.827 --> 01:04:38.696
I'm trying, you know,
I'm trying to do these things,

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.265
like, make you proud.

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:46.370
Yo man, I'm glad
we're doing this shit, man.

01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.572
- I'm glad we gonna be square.
- Square.

01:04:49.674 --> 01:04:53.310
Look, I gotta be honest man.
Like, when you take my shit,

01:04:53.343 --> 01:04:56.647
and then you don't even
speak to me, it hurt, man.

01:04:56.681 --> 01:05:00.384
I was angry as all hell, man.
But, you know, after this,

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:02.319
- we gonna be square.
- Square.

01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:04.789
Shit, your makeup
really is fucked up.

01:05:04.822 --> 01:05:06.189
She drunk, huh?

01:05:07.357 --> 01:05:10.862
So you're Dracula so the cops
won't be able to find you?

01:05:10.895 --> 01:05:12.664
Yeah.

01:05:12.697 --> 01:05:15.733
Well, won't the cops
just be looking for Dracula?

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:20.237
Exactly.

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:52.436
Coco, you just be ready
with the car.

01:05:52.469 --> 01:05:55.472
Phil, I need you to keep
your fucking eyes open.

01:05:55.505 --> 01:05:58.308
Coco, I'm gonna need
some more shnarff-shnarff!

01:05:58.342 --> 01:05:59.777
A little more shnarff-shnarff,
Phil.

01:05:59.811 --> 01:06:01.578
We need more
shnarff-shnarff, baby!

01:06:01.612 --> 01:06:04.181
I don't have any physically
on me, so to speak.

01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:06.149
- That is a problem.
- What the fuck, Phil!

01:06:06.183 --> 01:06:09.453
- Yo.
- Yo, you have one fucking job.

01:06:09.486 --> 01:06:10.922
Oh, you've heisted before.

01:06:10.955 --> 01:06:12.690
What you heisted before,
a fucking candy bar?

01:06:12.724 --> 01:06:15.192
Yo, yo, I heisted
your mom's cookies, bro.

01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:17.427
You're pissing me off, Phil.
Just shut the fuck up

01:06:17.461 --> 01:06:18.930
for, like,
two seconds, all right?

01:06:18.963 --> 01:06:20.530
- Yo...
- Yo, shut the fuck up, Phil!

01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:22.466
- Phil, I got you, dawg.
- I know you would.

01:06:22.499 --> 01:06:24.702
I know, I know.
You don't even gotta tell me.

01:06:24.736 --> 01:06:28.873
It's... It's... the magnets...
the magnets, it's the world,

01:06:28.906 --> 01:06:30.675
it's the whatever
it's the spiritual realms,

01:06:30.708 --> 01:06:33.610
it's all coming together,
and we're together now...

01:06:33.644 --> 01:06:35.913
Dude, how you do coke
in that bear costume?

01:06:35.947 --> 01:06:38.382
You have to take the head off
every time you do cocaine?

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:40.450
No, I sneak it
through its snout.

01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:42.185
You're a teddy bear,
you might wanna do

01:06:42.219 --> 01:06:43.921
like a high Mickey Mouse voice.
That would be like,

01:06:43.955 --> 01:06:45.857
"Oh, hi, buddy.
Oh, get me in the safe."

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:47.290
Practice, practice!

01:06:47.324 --> 01:06:48.492
Open the fucking safe!

01:06:48.525 --> 01:06:50.193
No, like Mickey Mouse, bro!

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.976
Hey, you want some candy?

01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:06.678
Enough
with the fucking candy!

01:07:06.711 --> 01:07:08.746
Get me the fucking safe.
I know it's up there!

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.883
Get the fuck up there!
Come on, get up there!

01:07:13.417 --> 01:07:15.585
- Get the fuck in there!
- All right.

01:07:15.619 --> 01:07:17.655
Put the fucking money
in the bag! Come on!

01:07:17.689 --> 01:07:18.990
All right!

01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:20.758
Put the fucking money
in the bag! All right?

01:07:29.299 --> 01:07:31.635
Come on,
give me that fucking shit!

01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:29.026
Someone got fucked up.
That girl's fucking drunk.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.361
I don't know, Rick,
that looks like...

01:08:31.394 --> 01:08:33.765
- That looks like Bonnie.
- No.

01:08:33.798 --> 01:08:38.069
Holy fuck, Bonnie. Bonnie.
Hey. Je... Bonnie, what happened?

01:08:38.102 --> 01:08:40.470
Bonnie.

01:08:40.504 --> 01:08:41.805
Bonnie, talk to me.
What happened?

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.439
Bonnie.

01:08:43.473 --> 01:08:45.743
- Hello?
- Bonnie, who did this to you?

01:08:45.777 --> 01:08:48.478
- Okay, okay, slow down.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:08:48.511 --> 01:08:50.580
- What?
- Who did this to you?

01:08:50.613 --> 01:08:52.683
- Who?
- What happened?

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.585
Okay, I'm on my way. Okay, bye.

01:08:55.618 --> 01:08:57.587
- Dude, someone robbed my house.
- What?

01:08:57.621 --> 01:08:59.791
Jim just called me and said
that someone came into our house

01:08:59.823 --> 01:09:01.725
wearing a costume
and took money from our safe.

01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:02.993
What are you talking
about?

01:09:03.027 --> 01:09:04.461
He's saying that you guys
did this.

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:06.764
What do you mean?
I'm right here.

01:09:06.798 --> 01:09:08.564
He says you, like,
set me up or something.

01:09:08.598 --> 01:09:10.567
- No, dude.
- I thought you were my friend.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.335
- No, come here.
- Hey, Cookie!

01:09:15.372 --> 01:09:17.541
Bonnie? Bonnie. Bonnie?

01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:20.711
Bonnie. What is happening?

01:09:20.745 --> 01:09:23.345
What did you do?
What did you do?

01:09:34.024 --> 01:09:36.359
Morning.

01:09:39.629 --> 01:09:43.868
Haven't been here in forever.
I thought you hated it here.

01:09:44.634 --> 01:09:45.703
I did.

01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:49.807
I been sleeping here,
looking for a job.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.743
- How's that going?
- Not well.

01:09:54.946 --> 01:09:57.380
We have to talk
about what you and Swan did.

01:09:58.749 --> 01:10:00.885
Honestly, I just sat in the car.

01:10:01.652 --> 01:10:02.787
Where's the money?

01:10:03.688 --> 01:10:06.057
Coco has it. He fucked us over.

01:10:07.124 --> 01:10:10.928
- He'd do that to you?
- Yeah.

01:10:10.962 --> 01:10:12.462
Jesus.

01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:15.565
I'm sorry.

01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:19.670
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

01:10:20.503 --> 01:10:23.040
For leaving. I just...

01:10:24.108 --> 01:10:28.145
Bonnie, I...
I need a change, you know?

01:10:28.179 --> 01:10:31.548
Like, I love you guys,
but it can't...

01:10:31.581 --> 01:10:34.417
it can't keep going on
like this, you know?

01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:37.822
And I feel so fucking bad
for Jim and for Cookie.

01:10:39.857 --> 01:10:41.158
What do we do?

01:10:42.392 --> 01:10:46.496
I've been thinking about it,
and I think we can fix this...

01:10:47.597 --> 01:10:49.033
if you'll help me.

01:10:49.066 --> 01:10:50.067
Of course.

01:10:52.937 --> 01:10:55.472
You wanna flip a coin?
Who holds the gun?

01:10:56.841 --> 01:10:57.909
Nope.

01:11:03.147 --> 01:11:06.449
Oh, fuck, yeah.
Oh, yeah, fuck, fuck.

01:11:06.483 --> 01:11:09.153
- You want some more?
- I can't feel my face.

01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:11.122
It's there.

01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:13.891
I'll be right back.

01:11:14.859 --> 01:11:16.661
Yo, Philostein, come on.

01:11:16.694 --> 01:11:18.528
Yo, Phil!

01:11:18.963 --> 01:11:21.666
Yo, Phil! Fucking junkie.

01:11:21.699 --> 01:11:24.567
<i>♪ Coco's got the stuff ♪</i>

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:26.037
<i>♪ Yeah, I do ♪</i>

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:28.039
<i>♪ Coco's got the... ♪</i>

01:11:28.072 --> 01:11:30.207
All right, all right,
that's good, that's good.

01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:32.143
I thought you liked my voice.

01:11:32.176 --> 01:11:34.611
I love your voice, baby.
You know that.

01:11:34.644 --> 01:11:36.479
I love your voice so much
I'm gonna make you a star.

01:11:36.513 --> 01:11:38.950
- Don't you wanna be a star?
- Yeah, I do.

01:11:38.983 --> 01:11:41.218
Yeah, that's right.

01:11:41.252 --> 01:11:42.887
- Baby.
- Yeah, baby.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.889
I wanted this so much,
and now we got it.

01:11:44.922 --> 01:11:47.758
- We got that 40 G's, baby.
- That's my Coco.

01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:49.827
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna be fucking huge.

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.628
Coco and Flo?

01:11:51.662 --> 01:11:53.530
Yeah, baby.
I'm gonna be a fucking star.

01:11:53.563 --> 01:11:54.899
Show me the mic.

01:11:54.932 --> 01:11:56.267
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm ready to sing.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.036
Oh, baby, I love
the way you fucking sing.

01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:01.538
- Oh, yeah.
- Um, baby?

01:12:01.571 --> 01:12:03.240
Yes, sing, baby, sing.

01:12:04.241 --> 01:12:05.876
I think this mic ain't on.

01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:08.746
Just sing 'til it is, girl.
Sing 'til it is.

01:12:08.779 --> 01:12:11.248
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow!
What the fuck?

01:12:11.282 --> 01:12:13.150
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

01:12:13.184 --> 01:12:15.953
Yo, chill out, chill out. What?

01:12:15.987 --> 01:12:17.989
Put the money in the bag.

01:12:18.022 --> 01:12:19.991
Fuck. Listen, the money's gone,
all right?

01:12:20.024 --> 01:12:22.159
It's gone! Just listen,
it's gone, all right?

01:12:22.193 --> 01:12:24.295
- It's fucking gone.
- Don't fucking move!

01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:26.731
- You must be Flo, huh?
- Yeah.

01:12:26.764 --> 01:12:29.200
You fuckin' junkies,
I need that money, all right?

01:12:29.233 --> 01:12:31.702
- Yo, it's for my music career.
- Yeah, yeah, we got it.

01:12:31.736 --> 01:12:33.971
No, fuck you, fuck no.

01:12:34.005 --> 01:12:35.873
The world needs
to hear my music, man!

01:12:35.906 --> 01:12:37.640
I think the world will be okay.

01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:40.643
- Fuck you, bitch.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:12:40.678 --> 01:12:43.580
This is fucked. You know what?
I didn't come after Swan

01:12:43.613 --> 01:12:45.149
or any of you
'cause you know Darla.

01:12:45.182 --> 01:12:47.218
I see any of you on the street
after this,

01:12:47.251 --> 01:12:49.186
you're getting cut,
that's a promise.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:52.656
Get the fuck out of here.

01:12:53.623 --> 01:12:54.925
Where the fuck you going?

01:12:56.626 --> 01:12:58.229
Yo, get the fuck back here!

01:12:58.896 --> 01:13:00.131
Is that a real threat?

01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:02.233
Deadass.

01:13:04.368 --> 01:13:06.103
I've been kidnapped.

01:13:06.137 --> 01:13:08.172
I managed to knock the guy out
and tie him up.

01:13:08.205 --> 01:13:10.107
The address?

01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:14.644
<i>342 River Street.
He has a gun and drugs. Hurry!</i>

01:13:21.118 --> 01:13:23.654
Well, well, well, well.

01:13:23.687 --> 01:13:25.956
What do you have to say
for yourself, abandoner?

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:31.796
- You're upset with me?
- I'm all ears, hmm? What is it?

01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:32.930
You robbed Jim and Cookie.

01:13:32.963 --> 01:13:34.631
Yeah, to get money for the boat.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:36.100
To get money
to get fucking wasted.

01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:37.768
For all of us.

01:13:37.802 --> 01:13:39.703
You're the one
who left your family, abandoner.

01:13:39.737 --> 01:13:41.238
Stop saying that.

01:13:41.272 --> 01:13:43.107
Bonnie, let's go get
our money back.

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.175
We just did.

01:13:45.109 --> 01:13:47.912
- You guys got the money?
- Yes.

01:13:47.945 --> 01:13:49.146
Did you take
his shnarff-shnarff too?

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:50.748
- No.
- Why the hell not?

01:13:50.781 --> 01:13:53.017
- Because we don't wanna be...
- None?

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:54.185
You're an asshole.

01:13:54.218 --> 01:13:56.854
I wasn't talking to you,
abandoner.

01:13:56.887 --> 01:13:59.757
- Swan.
- I don't wanna be a bum anymore.

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.392
Oh, so you're too good for us?

01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:04.261
No, I don't wanna be
a fucking junkie with you.

01:14:07.998 --> 01:14:10.633
Too good for your family,
abandoner? Huh?

01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:13.137
Stop it.
Stop it. You guys, stop.

01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:15.272
Stop.

01:14:15.306 --> 01:14:17.074
- Rick.
- You're a fucking asshole.

01:14:17.108 --> 01:14:19.110
- Stop.
- Fucking stop.

01:14:19.143 --> 01:14:21.912
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:14:21.946 --> 01:14:23.247
I'm sorry.

01:14:24.281 --> 01:14:26.984
You're fucking poison,
man.

01:14:28.018 --> 01:14:31.922
Listen, I know you love us,
and you're trying to help us,

01:14:31.956 --> 01:14:34.792
but you're too fucked up
to lead us out of this shit man.

01:14:38.162 --> 01:14:42.666
Rick, the whole point is to get
the boat, and to get better...

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.869
Where's the boat?
Where's the boat?

01:14:44.902 --> 01:14:47.271
- Where's the boat?
- Boats are expensive.

01:14:47.304 --> 01:14:49.273
You don't need a boat
to get better.

01:14:49.306 --> 01:14:52.443
It's procrastinating.
It's a fucking excuse.

01:14:52.476 --> 01:14:54.278
Rick.

01:14:55.379 --> 01:14:57.715
You're my big fucking
brother, man.

01:15:03.754 --> 01:15:04.722
Ricky.

01:15:07.358 --> 01:15:08.759
What do you want?

01:15:10.094 --> 01:15:12.096
I'm going to San Francisco
tomorrow.

01:15:13.097 --> 01:15:15.866
You're welcome to come with me.
You're welcome to stay.

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:20.004
I don't give a shit.
I'm taking the car. It's mine.

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:25.042
You guys can have the house.
I think you should sell it.

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:31.115
I could go back to school.
You could finish school.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.218
This is a lot.

01:15:34.251 --> 01:15:36.020
It's gonna have
to be a lot, man.

01:15:36.053 --> 01:15:38.889
To get from this bad to good,
it's... it's...

01:15:38.923 --> 01:15:40.457
It's gonna have to be a lot.

01:15:40.491 --> 01:15:43.160
It's not gonna happen gradually,
you know?

01:15:43.194 --> 01:15:45.963
I don't wanna spend one more
fucking day feeling like this.

01:15:47.198 --> 01:15:50.100
What do you think
Dad would think of all this?

01:15:54.772 --> 01:15:57.141
- Not good.
- We have to make things right.

01:15:59.043 --> 01:16:02.179
- How do we do that?
- We have a plan.

01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:13.924
You know all I ever wanted
was for us to get better?

01:16:13.958 --> 01:16:15.392
We know.

01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:32.409
So what's the plan?

01:16:38.983 --> 01:16:42.353
Hey. You got a second?
We'll go for a walk?

01:16:43.887 --> 01:16:45.923
I have ten minutes.

01:16:45.956 --> 01:16:48.959
That's plenty.
I can work with that. Let's go.

01:16:48.993 --> 01:16:50.828
Better be worth
wasting my break on.

Listen, we had a dream,

01:19:04.061 --> 01:19:07.164
and there's no reason
we can't have that, you know?

01:19:08.666 --> 01:19:13.036
I know I was messed up,
and I wasted our time, and...

01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:15.707
I'm sorry for that,
but there's no reason

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.274
we can't
get the fuck out of here.

01:19:17.307 --> 01:19:18.542
There's no reason
we still can't go.

01:19:19.977 --> 01:19:22.446
I just wanna be with you,
you know?

01:19:22.479 --> 01:19:24.214
I wanna get
the fuck out of here.

01:19:24.248 --> 01:19:26.617
- I...
- I wanna get out of here.

01:19:26.651 --> 01:19:28.720
- You wanna leave here with me?
- I wa...

01:19:28.753 --> 01:19:32.055
- Yes, I wanna get out of here.
- Then let's get out of here.

01:19:32.089 --> 01:19:34.525
Let's go. Let's go.
What are we waiting for?

01:19:37.294 --> 01:19:38.562
I love you.

01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:46.069
7:00 a.m. tomorrow, I'm gonna be
out front of your place.

01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:49.039
Please, please come.
Please, please, please, please.

01:19:49.072 --> 01:19:50.574
Please, I'm begging you.

01:19:54.679 --> 01:19:55.546
7:00 a.m., okay?

01:19:57.014 --> 01:19:59.383
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

01:20:00.785 --> 01:20:02.152
Tomorrow.

01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:36.253
There he is.

01:20:36.286 --> 01:20:38.222
I'm here, I'm here.

01:20:39.056 --> 01:20:41.124
I'm here. I'm ready.

01:20:41.158 --> 01:20:43.527
It is time for us to embark.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.162
Let's go.

01:20:45.195 --> 01:20:46.764
Alas, my friend Cookie,

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:50.601
I have some news that aches
my heart to have to tell.

01:20:51.736 --> 01:20:54.137
The time has come for us
to journey on

01:20:54.171 --> 01:20:56.073
and cleanse ourselves
of our monsters,

01:20:56.573 --> 01:20:59.476
but you cannot accompany us,
I'm afraid.

01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:01.245
- Why?
- Because...

01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:02.412
That's not fair.

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.249
I have an apology
to make to you.

01:21:05.783 --> 01:21:08.686
As your captain,
I led you the wrong way,

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.454
taught you the wrong things.

01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:12.757
The truth is...

01:21:17.294 --> 01:21:18.495
The truth is,

01:21:19.329 --> 01:21:21.532
when you have a papa-shaped hole
in your chest,

01:21:22.432 --> 01:21:23.735
nothing can fill it.

01:21:24.769 --> 01:21:27.104
You can stick booze, drugs,

01:21:27.137 --> 01:21:29.273
cigarettes, anger,
and mischief in there,

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.477
but if you do,
how could it ever close up?

01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:37.548
How is it supposed to heal
with all that... shit in there?

01:21:38.482 --> 01:21:41.618
The only way it can close up,
it can heal...

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.290
is to let it heal. Slowly.

01:21:46.323 --> 01:21:49.326
And boy, will there be a scar.
There will.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:52.195
But it will be the shape
of your father,

01:21:53.163 --> 01:21:55.232
and the sign
of his everlasting love.

01:21:58.368 --> 01:21:59.570
But I'll miss you, guys.

01:22:01.138 --> 01:22:04.408
You will see us again,
when we're capable of good.

01:22:05.275 --> 01:22:07.311
- We love you, Cookie.
- We do.

01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:09.580
- We love you, buddy.
- We love you forever.

01:22:10.715 --> 01:22:13.450
You know who else loves you?
Jim.

01:22:14.318 --> 01:22:16.153
Loves you more than anyone else
in the world.

01:22:16.186 --> 01:22:18.188
And he needs you right now.

01:22:18.221 --> 01:22:19.256
And you need him.

01:22:20.658 --> 01:22:22.192
A tribe.

01:22:22.225 --> 01:22:23.661
Just like this one.

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:37.842
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:41.645
Time for goodbyes.

01:22:48.686 --> 01:22:50.287
We'll see you soon.

01:23:25.823 --> 01:23:27.759
All right, it's time.

01:25:37.311 --> 01:25:42.311
