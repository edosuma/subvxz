Anyway, I'm off to
Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.

00:13.393 --> 00:15.645
He has cancer, which, as
you know, is a whole thing.

00:15.729 --> 00:17.856
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use

00:17.940 --> 00:19.566
some good news at the end of the day.

00:19.649 --> 00:21.235
Oh, my God. You're going to see Herb?

00:36.208 --> 00:37.375
And your memoirist.

00:37.459 --> 00:38.460
I should meet your old best friend

00:38.543 --> 00:39.836
before he dies of cancer.

01:01.858 --> 01:03.986
So what's the deal with you and this guy?

01:04.069 --> 01:05.403
You never talk about him.

01:05.486 --> 01:08.824
Well, I kind of, maybe
stabbed him in the back.

01:08.907 --> 01:11.451
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

- Is it me?
- It's always you.

Me either. No, I just... You know,

08:17.544 --> 08:20.255
- I caught up in the moment.
- Yeah, no, I gotcha.

08:20.338 --> 08:21.881
BJ, can you believe it?

08:21.964 --> 08:24.593
We're gonna make an actual TV show!

08:24.676 --> 08:26.553
One that takes an unflinching look

08:26.636 --> 08:30.473
at the gritty reality
of the American family.

08:30.557 --> 08:32.308
Just kidding. Let's get rich!

Why would I say, "You'll never get me

08:49.951 --> 08:51.620
in that sweater" in this scene

08:51.703 --> 08:53.580
and then, in the very next scene,

08:53.663 --> 08:55.123
I'm wearing the sweater?

08:55.206 --> 08:56.833
Did my character suddenly forget

08:56.916 --> 08:58.293
that he didn't want to wear the sweater?

08:58.376 --> 08:59.669
No, see, that's actually the joke.

08:59.753 --> 09:01.129
Don't explain the joke to me.

09:01.212 --> 09:02.589
I just don't understand how it's a joke.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.924
So you do want me to explain it to you?

09:05.007 --> 09:06.509
I want you to add a scene showing

09:06.593 --> 09:08.094
how I changed my mind about the sweater

09:08.177 --> 09:09.763
so the goddamn episode makes sense.

09:09.846 --> 09:11.640
Look at me, doing your job for you.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.182
Way to go, Shakespeare.

09:15.268 --> 09:17.270
What happened to the stories I requested?

09:17.353 --> 09:19.689
Where's my rap? You said
you'd write me a rap.

09:19.773 --> 09:21.274
We're working on it.

09:21.357 --> 09:23.443
We just need a rhyme for
"and I'm here to say."

09:23.526 --> 09:25.027
Well, what about giving me Rollerblades?

09:25.111 --> 09:26.946
How are people gonna know
that my character is hip

09:27.029 --> 09:28.824
if he doesn't roll the blade?

09:28.906 --> 09:30.492
Just get out there and do your job.

09:30.575 --> 09:33.035
Every one of your ideas
is stupid or racist.

09:33.119 --> 09:34.537
That was one pitch,

09:34.621 --> 09:35.747
and I didn't say they're all thieves.

09:35.831 --> 09:37.457
But if you're too scared to start

09:37.540 --> 09:39.375
a national dialogue, maybe
I'll take my ideas home.

09:39.459 --> 09:41.837
Good luck making Horsin'
Around without the horse.

09:41.919 --> 09:43.588

taste some of your magic.

10:51.322 --> 10:53.909
Ha-ha. She is attractive.

10:53.991 --> 10:59.247
Good God, when I die,
bury me in Kathy Ireland.

11:09.340 --> 11:10.633
That's amazing.

11:10.717 --> 11:12.218
Thank you. Thank you.

11:12.301 --> 11:13.762
Now, listen.

I don't want to see you
in any more tabloids.

11:33.030 --> 11:35.617
was caught tonight in an LAPD sting

- on public indecency.
- Wha...

11:37.368 --> 11:38.995
Police say Mr. Kazzaz
was caught in the middle

11:39.078 --> 11:41.247
of lewd acts with another man.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.458
Conservative groups have
been quick to organize.

11:43.541 --> 11:45.877
Horsin' Around is a show for kids.

11:45.961 --> 11:48.588
My family should be able to
watch those nubile preteens

11:48.671 --> 11:51.048
without men like perv Kazzaz flaunting

11:51.132 --> 11:53.384

and ruining America.

12:03.728 --> 12:06.147
- I'm gay.
- No doy.

12:06.230 --> 12:09.484
I know we haven't been close
for the past couple years.

12:09.567 --> 12:10.860
Okay, I'm gonna hold back my "No doys"

12:10.944 --> 12:11.987
because there might be a lot.

12:12.069 --> 12:13.362
But you know me, right?

12:13.446 --> 12:14.990
You know that I'm a good guy.

12:15.072 --> 12:16.741
They're gunning for me at the network,

12:16.825 --> 12:19.285

this, I won't recover.

12:19.368 --> 12:21.120
I need to know that you've got my back.

If you threaten to walk,
they'll listen to you.

worst possible time to...

ask if I didn't need it.

here if it weren't for you.

train or a fun circle?

be doing that all the...

13:06.791 --> 13:08.167

13:08.250 --> 13:09.544
See, that's what I'm talking about.

13:09.627 --> 13:11.128
That's great.

13:11.212 --> 13:13.089
We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase

13:13.172 --> 13:15.717
"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.

13:18.260 --> 13:20.972
BoJack, can we chat for a second?

13:21.056 --> 13:24.684
Ugh. Here we go. It's the big one.

13:24.767 --> 13:27.144
I'm not gonna waste
your time with small talk

13:27.228 --> 13:29.313
because you work for me,
and your time is my time.

13:29.397 --> 13:31.024
We're letting Herb go.

13:31.107 --> 13:32.692
- You can't do that.
- "I can't do that."

13:32.775 --> 13:34.610
I'm not asking you. It's nothing personal.

13:34.694 --> 13:36.696
I like Herb. I think he's a good guy.

13:36.779 --> 13:38.322
But this is a business, and every day

13:38.406 --> 13:39.866
we don't fire him, we're flushing money

13:39.949 --> 13:41.701
- down the crapper.
- Well, if he goes, I go.

13:41.784 --> 13:42.994
"Well, if he goes, you
go." I wouldn't do that.

13:43.078 --> 13:44.704
BoJack, I think you're a star,

13:44.787 --> 13:47.832
and sometimes being a star
means making tough choices.

13:47.916 --> 13:50.085
You can storm out, make a big show out of

13:50.167 --> 13:51.460
what a "good" friend you are,

13:51.544 --> 13:53.379
or you could be the guy who does his job.

13:53.462 --> 13:54.839
- Angela...
- I'll tell you when

13:54.923 --> 13:56.632
it's your turn to talk again.

13:56.716 --> 13:58.760
Look, you're a star,
but this is really just

13:58.843 --> 14:01.054
the beginning of the BoJack Horseman story.

14:01.137 --> 14:03.472
You can choose whatever path you want,

14:03.556 --> 14:05.016
but I'll tell you right now.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.684
You don't win awards and you don't

14:06.768 --> 14:08.603
get to be on the covers of magazines

14:08.686 --> 14:10.438
and you don't get to play the lead role

14:10.521 --> 14:13.274
in the Secretariat movie
by being a good friend.

14:13.357 --> 14:15.985
What's that old expression
about how the show must go on?

14:16.069 --> 14:18.821
Oh, right. It's "Don't be an idiot."

14:18.905 --> 14:22.117
So what do you think, BoJack?
That's a courtesy question.

14:22.199 --> 14:24.744
I already know what you think
because I have conversations

14:24.827 --> 14:26.412
like this one five times a day.

14:26.495 --> 14:28.372
I know who you are, and I know

14:28.456 --> 14:29.457
you've already made your decision.

14:29.540 --> 14:31.126
But if you want to surprise me,

14:31.208 --> 14:32.585
now's the time to do it.

14:32.668 --> 14:34.420
That's what I thought.

14:34.503 --> 14:36.380
You're doing the right
thing. I know it's hard.

14:36.464 --> 14:38.549
But if Herb's really your
friend, he'll understand.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.593
Now, you've got a show to put on,

14:40.676 --> 14:42.053
so I'll let you get ready.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.430
This was a good conversation. Productive.

never talk to you again.

- Are you sure?

16:35.166 --> 16:36.876
Because if that knife ain't sharp enough,

16:36.959 --> 16:39.754
I got another that you left
in my back 20 years ago.

16:39.837 --> 16:41.256
- [laughs]
- Could have seen that coming.

16:41.338 --> 16:42.631
Who asks about utensils?

16:42.715 --> 16:43.841
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

16:43.925 --> 16:45.634
Nope. No, you are not.

16:45.718 --> 16:47.262
Uh.

16:47.344 --> 16:49.264
Oh. Ow. Almost.

16:49.346 --> 16:51.348
[exciting music]

16:51.432 --> 16:53.350
- Drive, drive, drive!
- Oh. Oh, no.

16:53.434 --> 16:55.186
I can't turn the car around.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.396
I've been trying to do this
three-point turn forever.

16:57.479 --> 16:59.774
I mean, it's more like a 300-point turn.

16:59.857 --> 17:01.358
- Am I right, huh?
- Hee hee hee hee!

17:01.442 --> 17:02.860
Hey, we've got two sacks

17:02.944 --> 17:04.653
of Kardashian swag and
the fuzz on our heels.

17:04.737 --> 17:07.281
You think this is Driver's
Ed, you hat-wearing pussy?

17:07.364 --> 17:10.785
Drive the goddamn car!

17:10.867 --> 17:12.954
[coughs]

17:14.663 --> 17:15.664
Hey, Herb,

17:15.748 --> 17:17.291
is that your Vitamix?

17:17.374 --> 17:18.584
BoJack has one, too.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.044
I wonder if you guys have

17:20.127 --> 17:23.339
strong opinions about
it one way or the other.

17:23.422 --> 17:25.133
Well, the stupid thing was like 600 bucks.

17:25.215 --> 17:27.218
I have used mine a grand
total of zero times.

17:27.301 --> 17:29.511
I got it a month before I
was diagnosed with cancer.

17:29.595 --> 17:31.306
I don't give a shit about
being healthy anymore.

17:31.388 --> 17:33.057
I don't even have cancer,
and I don't use it.

17:33.141 --> 17:34.475
- So who's it for?
- Exactly.

17:34.558 --> 17:36.352
What is so great about liquids?

17:36.435 --> 17:39.480
Every article I read now is
"juice this" and "juice that."

17:39.563 --> 17:41.774
You know why? Juice controls the media.

17:41.857 --> 17:45.194
- Hey-ooh.
- [both laugh]

17:45.278 --> 17:47.071
Can't this thing go any faster?

17:47.155 --> 17:49.448
Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.

17:49.531 --> 17:52.201
[tires squealing]

17:52.285 --> 17:53.786
Do you want me to get
out? Try to guide you?

17:53.869 --> 17:55.204
No, I think I'm almost there.

17:55.288 --> 17:56.580
You're doing a great job.

17:56.664 --> 17:58.791
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

17:58.874 --> 18:00.876
Why? He's being nice.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.086
Remember the number one rule

18:02.170 --> 18:03.712
of the Celebrity Stealing Club...

18:03.796 --> 18:05.631
- "No falling in love."
- Ugh.

18:05.714 --> 18:07.800
That's your rule for every club.

18:07.883 --> 18:09.677
It's a good rule.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.846
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

18:11.929 --> 18:14.223
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.

18:14.307 --> 18:17.810
Maybe we should take our
masks off and actually talk.

18:17.893 --> 18:20.313
You want me to take my mask off? Fine.

18:20.396 --> 18:22.564
Happy? I took my mask off.

18:22.648 --> 18:24.066
Did you?

18:24.150 --> 18:27.320
Because I think you're
still wearing a mask.

18:27.403 --> 18:29.905
[both] Oh.

18:29.989 --> 18:32.367
Oh, my God, Herb, you
met President Clinton?

18:32.449 --> 18:33.868
Oh, yeah. Many times.

18:33.951 --> 18:35.328
Did you think that I
spent the last 20 years

18:35.411 --> 18:37.246
on my couch just feeling sorry for myself?

18:37.330 --> 18:39.415
I mean, I did do that,
but I also started...

18:39.498 --> 18:41.500
[coughs] a charity to bring clean water

18:41.583 --> 18:43.460
to millions of children
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

18:43.544 --> 18:44.837
Oh, wow.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.422
I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.

18:46.505 --> 18:48.341
Wait, is that Charlotte?

18:48.424 --> 18:49.633
Yeah, yeah. We kept in touch.

18:49.717 --> 18:51.260
You should actually give her a call.

18:51.344 --> 18:53.095
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.

18:53.179 --> 18:54.847
She looks good for someone so old.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.098
She's three years younger than you.

18:56.182 --> 18:58.184
- Exactly!
- [laughs]

18:58.267 --> 19:00.019
- [coughs]
- Er?

19:00.102 --> 19:01.937
Well, guys, I'm pretty beat.

19:02.021 --> 19:03.314
I think I need to head off to bed,

19:03.398 --> 19:04.815
and I hope I actually wake up later.

19:04.899 --> 19:06.859
[coughs]

19:06.942 --> 19:10.446
And it was actually
nice to see you, BoJack.

19:10.529 --> 19:11.613
You can see yourselves out.

19:11.697 --> 19:13.366
[chuckling]

19:13.449 --> 19:15.368
"Juice controls the media."

19:15.451 --> 19:18.120
[chuckling] I love it.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.290
So I guess in a sense

19:21.374 --> 19:22.917
I'm running away from the cops,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.170
but I feel like in another, truer sense,

19:26.254 --> 19:28.256
I'm running away from myself.

19:28.339 --> 19:30.549
- Truth. Truth.
- Whoa.

19:30.632 --> 19:32.843
Kenzie, do you have anything to share?

19:32.927 --> 19:34.803
Just how amazing it feels to finally

19:34.887 --> 19:35.930
be honest for once.

19:36.013 --> 19:37.514
I could live a million lives,

19:37.598 --> 19:39.434
and I'd never forget this one afternoon.

19:39.516 --> 19:40.684
Word.

19:40.768 --> 19:41.977
You know, I act all cool

19:42.061 --> 19:43.938
and sophisticated on the outside,

19:44.063 --> 19:47.275
but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know?

19:47.358 --> 19:49.402
But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally

19:49.485 --> 19:51.112
- ready to let my guard down.
- Do you hear that?

19:51.195 --> 19:53.281
- He's letting his guard down.
- Let's get him!

19:53.364 --> 19:54.782
- [grunts]
- Oh!

19:54.865 --> 19:57.118
[both] Celebrity Stealing
Club strikes again.

19:57.201 --> 20:00.496
[upbeat music]

20:01.747 --> 20:05.042
This... This just doesn't feel right.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.002
I should have brought a bottle of wine.

20:07.086 --> 20:09.213
That's what adults do. BoJack, damn it.

20:09.297 --> 20:10.839
Is that what's bothering you,

20:10.923 --> 20:12.883
- that you didn't bring wine?
- You're right.

20:12.967 --> 20:14.302
I just would have drunk it on the way here.

20:14.385 --> 20:16.262
This isn't about wine, BoJack.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.265
If you have something you
need to say to someone,

20:19.348 --> 20:21.934
you should do it while you have the chance

20:22.017 --> 20:24.979
because before you know
it, it'll be too late.

20:25.104 --> 20:26.688
Is this one of those
things where we're talking

20:26.772 --> 20:29.108
about Herb but we're actually
talking about something else?

20:29.191 --> 20:31.986
- No, I was talking about Herb.
- Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

20:32.069 --> 20:34.655
[cheerfully] Hey, buddy!

20:34.738 --> 20:36.865
You come back for that Vitamix, you...

20:36.949 --> 20:38.993
[coughs]

20:39.076 --> 20:40.536
Ooh, you should get that looked at.

20:40.619 --> 20:43.038
Yeah. I've been meaning to see a doctor.

20:43.122 --> 20:46.375
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about... you know.

20:46.459 --> 20:51.005
I feel bad about what happened.

20:51.088 --> 20:53.174
So you're apologizing.

20:53.257 --> 20:55.468
Yes. I'm sorry.

20:55.551 --> 20:57.512
Okay. I don't forgive you.

20:57.594 --> 20:58.971
Herb, I said I'm sorry.

20:59.054 --> 21:01.765
Yeah, and I do not forgive you.

21:01.849 --> 21:04.810
Uh... not sure you get
what's happening here.

21:04.893 --> 21:06.979
This could be the last time that you...

21:07.104 --> 21:09.398
No. I'm not gonna give you closure.

21:09.482 --> 21:10.858
You don't get that.

21:10.941 --> 21:12.527
[coughs] You have to live

21:12.609 --> 21:14.111
with the shitty thing you did

21:14.195 --> 21:15.530
for the rest of your life.

21:15.612 --> 21:17.406
You have to know that it's never,

21:17.490 --> 21:18.949
ever going to be okay.

21:19.033 --> 21:21.035
I really think that we'd both

21:21.118 --> 21:22.661
- feel better if we just...
- I'm dying.

21:22.744 --> 21:24.372
I'm not gonna feel better,

21:24.455 --> 21:26.665
and I'm not gonna be your
prop so you can feel better.

21:26.748 --> 21:28.501
You have to believe me.

21:28.584 --> 21:30.127
- I did everything I could.
- Yeah?

21:30.211 --> 21:32.254
Then why didn't you call me? Huh?

21:32.338 --> 21:34.673
20 years... You didn't call me.

21:34.756 --> 21:37.259
Look, I... I wanted to,
but I didn't think...

21:37.343 --> 21:38.553
You know what it was like for me?

21:38.635 --> 21:40.762
I had nobody. Everybody left.

21:40.846 --> 21:42.557
I knew all those showbiz
phonies would turn on me.

21:42.639 --> 21:43.974
Sure. But you?

21:44.058 --> 21:45.642
It's not my fault you got fired.

21:45.726 --> 21:47.728
I don't care about the job!

21:47.811 --> 21:50.898
I did fine. I had a good life.

21:50.981 --> 21:53.025
But what I needed then was a friend,

21:53.108 --> 21:55.194
and you abandoned me.

21:55.277 --> 21:58.531
And I will never forgive you for that.

21:58.614 --> 22:02.201
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

22:02.284 --> 22:03.911
I...

22:03.994 --> 22:05.580
[sighs]

22:08.082 --> 22:09.791
Hey, this is a dumb
question, but the gay thing

22:09.875 --> 22:11.419
and the rectal cancer thing
aren't related, are they?

22:11.502 --> 22:12.753
- Get out of here!
- Never mind.

22:12.836 --> 22:15.047
Stupid question. Forget I brought it up.

22:15.130 --> 22:17.592
- Huh.
- Hey, BJ.

22:17.674 --> 22:20.094
- Put that back, asshole!
- No, you gave this to me.

22:20.177 --> 22:21.303
- [growls]
- No!

22:21.387 --> 22:23.889
[both grunting]

22:23.972 --> 22:25.516
[Diane] BoJack?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.352
What are you doing? Get off him.

22:28.436 --> 22:30.687
The show was never the
same after I left. Admit it.

22:30.812 --> 22:33.107
Some people prefer the later years.

22:34.609 --> 22:37.152
- [growling]
- BoJack. Come on.

22:37.236 --> 22:39.780
- [panting]
- Thank you for inviting us.

22:39.863 --> 22:41.949
You have a lovely home.

22:42.032 --> 22:43.492
You know what your problem is?

22:43.576 --> 22:45.827
You want to think of
yourself as the good guy.

22:45.911 --> 22:47.788
Well, I know you better than anyone,

22:47.871 --> 22:50.124
and I can tell you that you're not.

22:50.207 --> 22:53.419
In fact, you'd probably
sleep a lot better at night

22:53.502 --> 22:55.212
if you just admitted to yourself

22:55.296 --> 22:57.548
that you're a selfish goddamn coward

22:57.632 --> 23:00.509
who takes whatever he wants
and doesn't give a shit

23:00.593 --> 23:02.010
about who he hurts.

23:02.094 --> 23:05.347
That's you. That's BoJack Horseman.

23:05.431 --> 23:08.601
I don't know why I came here.

23:08.684 --> 23:12.187
Yeah. You do.

23:12.271 --> 23:14.189
[engine revs, tires screech]

23:14.273 --> 23:16.525
[Princess Carolyn] You
said you wanted a job.

23:16.609 --> 23:19.528
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

23:19.612 --> 23:21.614
Wow. What happened in Malibu?

23:21.697 --> 23:23.824
- I gotta go.
- [phone beeps]

23:23.907 --> 23:25.951
Hey, bright side.

23:26.034 --> 23:27.953
At least now you have a good story to tell

23:28.036 --> 23:29.997
at his funeral.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.082
Ugh, God.

23:43.802 --> 23:46.054
I'm not trying to kill the vibe here,

23:46.138 --> 23:48.683
but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

23:48.765 --> 23:50.392
[sighs]

23:50.476 --> 23:51.977
Look, I won't put what happened today

23:52.060 --> 23:53.729
in the book if you don't want me to.

23:53.812 --> 23:55.147
No, it's okay.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.232
Full truth like we agreed.

23:57.316 --> 23:58.400
Warts and all.

23:58.484 --> 23:59.943
It doesn't matter anyway.

24:00.027 --> 24:02.112
I don't even care what
anybody thinks anymore.

24:02.196 --> 24:03.656
Well, for what it's worth,

24:03.739 --> 24:05.199
I think it took a lot of guts

24:05.282 --> 24:06.701
to do what you did back there.

24:06.783 --> 24:09.370
[water lapping]

24:09.453 --> 24:10.705
- Mmm...
- Mm!
