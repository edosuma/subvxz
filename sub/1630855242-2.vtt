WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.870
Hey... Carly.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.460
Do you want a napkin
or perhaps

00:11.660 --> 00:14.660
a vacuum to go
with all these crumbs?

00:14.860 --> 00:16.860
No.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.330
What I want is Freddie.

00:19.530 --> 00:22.350
What I have is queso.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.890
Eh...

00:29.060 --> 00:30.630
Eh...

00:34.700 --> 00:37.120
He made my knees buckle.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.720
Do you know how that feels?

00:38.920 --> 00:41.350
Girl, my knees have done things
your knees never will.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.120
But that's not the point.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.890
Look, Freddie has a girlfriend.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.560
A girlfriend whose name I forget
every time I see her.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.050
But a girlfriend nonetheless.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.490
(gasps)

01:02.290 --> 01:03.480
What apps are you on?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.810
Oh, love applications?

01:06.010 --> 01:08.710
I've heard those can leave
viruses on your phone.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.520
You could stand to get
a few viruses,

01:10.720 --> 01:12.950
'cause you're not
getting any from--

01:13.150 --> 01:14.090
Freddie!

01:14.290 --> 01:15.590
And <i>you.</i>

01:15.790 --> 01:16.790
FREDDIE:
Sorry to barge in,

01:16.990 --> 01:18.460
but can we steal
some brown yarn?

01:18.660 --> 01:20.260
Oh, you guys are doing
yarn crafts now?

01:20.460 --> 01:23.530
We're making a little Statue of
Liberty in the original copper.

01:23.730 --> 01:25.300
Oh, I actually do have
copper-colored yarn.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.270
Ah, yes. I knew
I could count on you,

01:27.470 --> 01:28.770
my favorite crazy yarn lady.

01:28.970 --> 01:29.870
(laughter)

01:30.070 --> 01:31.050
Brown is fine.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.470
Is anyone gonna tell Carly she
has cheese all over her face?

01:34.670 --> 01:36.560
'Cause I am not close enough
with her.

01:39.800 --> 01:44.520
Um, it's for my new character,
Captain American Cheese.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.650
(awkward laugh)

01:45.850 --> 01:47.950
Uh, who fights crime with queso.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.840
(laughs)

01:50.610 --> 01:52.890
We'll talk about it
at our story meeting later.

01:53.090 --> 01:54.590
Oh, um, we're gonna be
kind of busy

01:54.790 --> 01:57.030
with this yarn thing
all afternoon.

01:57.230 --> 01:58.700
Well, Carly is busy, too.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.700
We just finished filling out
her new Sevens Only profile,

02:01.900 --> 02:04.990
and I made her seem crazy.
Guys like that.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.540
Oh, wow. So you're actively
looking for a...

02:09.740 --> 02:11.410
gentleman caller?

02:11.610 --> 02:14.100
Not necessarily.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.020
Well, be careful, though.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.520
A lot of those love applications

02:18.720 --> 02:21.290
can leave viruses
on your phone.

02:21.490 --> 02:22.990
I think that is
the perfect app for you.

02:23.190 --> 02:25.390
You're absolutely a seven
in Seattle.

02:25.590 --> 02:26.940
Thank you?

02:28.140 --> 02:30.760
Yeah, I'm not just
on Sevens Only.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.200
I downloaded
Nondenominational Mingle,

02:33.400 --> 02:36.770
the Gorch List, Scraps...

02:36.970 --> 02:37.970
This bitch.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.440
Is that another app?
I'll download it.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.080
No. I just got a text
from <i>Tinsley.</i>

02:44.280 --> 02:45.810
Who's <i>Tinsley?</i>

02:46.010 --> 02:47.380
And why do you say her name
like Madonna

02:47.580 --> 02:49.920
when she was trying
to be British?

02:50.120 --> 02:51.650
This girl I went
to boarding school with.

02:51.850 --> 02:54.090
She just asked me to style her
for the Net Gala.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.950
It's like the Met Gala
but with nets.

02:56.150 --> 02:58.020
It's almost impossible
to get into.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.460
Oh, because of the nets.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.000
This girl tormented me
all through high school.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.030
Now all of a sudden
she wants to give me a job

03:06.230 --> 03:07.300
I desperately need?

03:07.500 --> 03:08.870
Oh, she probably wants
to see you again

03:09.070 --> 03:10.740
so she can rub it in your face
that you're poor now.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.670
Exactly.
Thank you!

03:13.870 --> 03:15.570
(quietly):
I want to say Squirrel.

03:15.770 --> 03:17.340
(door opens)

03:17.540 --> 03:19.850
I don't want to talk about it.

03:20.050 --> 03:23.020
The <i>Seattle Penny Pincher</i>
gave him a bad review

03:23.220 --> 03:24.520
on his last art piece.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.620
Ooh, I hang out with
people who get reviews.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.990
I feel like I'm on <i>Entourage.</i>

03:29.190 --> 03:31.690
It says, "Spencer Shay
has become so ensconced

03:31.890 --> 03:34.390
"in his one-percent bubble,
he's lost touch

03:34.590 --> 03:36.400
with the average working man."

03:36.600 --> 03:38.760
That is bull crap!

03:38.960 --> 03:40.770
There's no one more average
than me.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.190
I'm the Maroon 5 of people.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.440
Comfort me!

03:46.640 --> 03:47.940
(phone vibrating)

03:48.140 --> 03:51.180
Yay! I've already got
three matches.

03:51.380 --> 03:54.010
Oh, wow. That was fast.

03:54.210 --> 03:55.680
For an attractive woman
under 30?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.770
That's actually terrible.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.720
* <i>I know</i> *

03:59.920 --> 04:01.720
* <i>You see</i> *

04:01.920 --> 04:03.720
* <i>Somehow the world</i>
<i>will change for me</i> *

04:03.920 --> 04:06.890
* <i>And be so wonderful</i> *

04:07.090 --> 04:11.360
* <i>So wake up</i>
<i>the members of my nation</i> *

04:11.560 --> 04:13.030
* <i>It's your time to be</i> *

04:13.230 --> 04:15.800
* <i>There's no chance</i>
<i>unless you take one</i> *

04:16.000 --> 04:18.240
* <i>And the time to see</i>
<i>the brighter side</i> *

04:18.440 --> 04:21.810
* <i>Of every situation</i> *

04:22.010 --> 04:23.580
* <i>Some things are meant to be</i> *

04:23.780 --> 04:27.530
* <i>So give your best</i>
<i>and leave the rest to me.</i> *

04:29.570 --> 04:32.590
So, how you feeling?

04:32.790 --> 04:35.150
You ready to get under Teddy,
Eddie or Betty?

04:35.350 --> 04:37.090
But if she rocks your world,
it is not my job

04:37.290 --> 04:38.590
to unpack that with you.

04:38.790 --> 04:41.590
Harper, I'm not gonna have
intercourse sex

04:41.790 --> 04:44.730
with some scrap
off the Internet.

04:44.930 --> 04:45.760
That's a scrap?

04:45.960 --> 04:49.970
He looks like a whole damn meal.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.970
That's him. But he was wearing
glasses in his profile.

04:53.170 --> 04:55.240
I mean, who wears glasses
one minute

04:55.440 --> 04:57.380
and then mysteriously doesn't
need 'em the next?

04:57.580 --> 04:58.860
Superman?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.150
Go meet your hot date
while I meet my hot bully.

05:02.350 --> 05:04.100
Damn, she looks expensive.

05:06.230 --> 05:08.220
Oh, Tinsley.

05:08.420 --> 05:09.860
BOTH:
Mwah. Mwah.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.160
Darling, I can see why
you hired me.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.910
Are you going camping
after this?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.200
You look fabulous.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.270
Seems the headgear really
sorted everything out.

05:22.470 --> 05:23.840
Didn't you hear?

05:24.040 --> 05:27.170
I ditched the headgear
for a full skull replacement.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.080
'Twas quite expensive, but not
for someone as rich as I,

05:30.280 --> 05:32.450
what with all my
celebrity clientele.

05:32.650 --> 05:35.750
Bey, Jay,
all of the Jennifers.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.620
- All the Jennifers?
- Mm-hmm.

05:37.820 --> 05:41.370
I would have thought
you'd be more selective.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.790
Wait, so you build furniture?

05:45.990 --> 05:50.230
Like Jesus or a young
Harrison Ford.

05:50.430 --> 05:53.470
Yeah, I make tables, chairs,

05:53.670 --> 05:55.730
stools, benches, desks.

05:55.930 --> 05:58.470
Which are like tables,
but for office work.

05:58.670 --> 05:59.710
End tables...

05:59.910 --> 06:00.770
Well, I guess I know
who to call

06:00.970 --> 06:02.580
the next time I go to IKEA.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.310
But that's not building
furniture.

06:04.510 --> 06:06.380
That's assembling furniture.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.880
It was just a joke.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.820
Oh, that's right, you said
you were a comedienne.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.590
Tell me another joke,
now that I'm ready for it.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.920
Well, I'm working on
this new sketch

06:18.120 --> 06:20.460
called Captain American Cheese.

06:20.660 --> 06:23.530
It's about the battle
between Gouda and evil.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.050
(laughs)

06:25.880 --> 06:28.750
So it's not like funny "ha-ha."

06:32.320 --> 06:34.970
You really went nuts
at that farmers market.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.880
I googled "regular people"
and "Sundays,"

06:37.080 --> 06:39.580
and this is what came up.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.210
Time for plan B.
If it's average Spencer

06:42.410 --> 06:43.920
the people want,
then it's average Spencer

06:44.120 --> 06:45.250
the people will get.

06:45.450 --> 06:46.950
I'm gonna give away
enough of my money

06:47.150 --> 06:48.920
so that I'm no longer
part of the one percent.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.460
Wait, so plan A was:
get a lot of corn?

06:52.660 --> 06:55.460
Well, you could always invest
in your old pal Freddie again.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.730
I mean, this head
is full of ideas.

06:57.930 --> 07:00.100
You know how it gets
colder at night?

07:00.300 --> 07:02.070
Stop!

07:02.270 --> 07:03.840
I wouldn't want
to burden you with wealth.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.640
Money is an evil mistress,

07:05.840 --> 07:07.440
and you're terrible with women.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.810
- Well, as the father
of a daughter...
- Stop!

07:11.010 --> 07:12.710
Freddie, that's not a bad idea.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.410
Night pants?

07:14.610 --> 07:16.680
No, that's a terrible idea,
but it's a good idea

07:16.880 --> 07:18.180
to invest in a bad business.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.720
That way I'm certain
to lose money.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.820
But how are you gonna
find a business

07:21.020 --> 07:22.350
that you know will fail?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.360
Will you consult trend
forecasters or economists...

07:24.560 --> 07:25.720
Stop!

07:25.920 --> 07:28.490
I'm 11. I can find anything
on the Internet.

07:28.690 --> 07:29.960
That's how we do.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.330
If this goes well,
I'll be so broke next year,

07:32.530 --> 07:34.350
I'll have to pay taxes.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.210
So, how did it go with Tinsley?

07:40.410 --> 07:43.080
Awful. In high school she
used to criticize everything.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.310
My skin, too soft.
My yacht, too big.

07:45.510 --> 07:47.750
My rendition of the Mouse King
in <i>The Nutcracker,</i>

07:47.950 --> 07:49.720
too graceful.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.980
Now all of a sudden,
she likes everything

07:51.180 --> 07:52.590
I put in front of her.

07:52.790 --> 07:55.390
She's up to something.

07:55.590 --> 07:56.920
How did last night go
with Superman?

07:57.120 --> 08:00.230
Was it a bird or a plane?

08:00.430 --> 08:05.000
I didn't have intercourse sex
with some rando in an alley.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.130
You had it in your bed?
Carly, he is a stranger.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.070
I'm giving him one more chance,

08:10.270 --> 08:12.470
but he's just not really
my type.

08:12.670 --> 08:13.840
Tall and handsome?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.270
Exactly. You know I like 'em
short and nerdy.

08:16.470 --> 08:18.990
(robot voice):
Greetings, fellow humans.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.880
CARLY:
Hey, buddy.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.180
What happened to you
this morning?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.920
I thought we were gonna shoot
Taco Tina

08:27.120 --> 08:28.490
doing her taco taxes.

08:28.690 --> 08:32.420
She's trying to claim guac
as a dependent.

08:32.630 --> 08:34.090
Sorry, no time to stop.

08:34.290 --> 08:36.900
We're almost up to the brown
yarn crown on Lady Liberty.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.800
Tomorrow we start knitting
the huddled masses

08:39.000 --> 08:41.800
<i>yarning</i> to breathe free.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.340
Well, it seems like
you made a little time

08:43.540 --> 08:47.060
to pick up some Froyo
for you and your fro-ho.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.170
Yeah, a little, uh, mint chip

08:49.370 --> 08:51.110
for me
and my little mint chippie.

08:51.310 --> 08:53.980
Mint chip? I thought you were
more of a coconut,

08:54.180 --> 08:55.880
passion fruit,
peanut butter with gummy bears,

08:56.080 --> 08:57.880
marshmallow sauce, bagel chips
kind of guy.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.720
Yeah, Pearl saw the baby
Mr. Peanut commercial,

09:00.920 --> 09:02.020
and now she doesn't feel like

09:02.220 --> 09:04.840
peanut butter is vegetarian
enough.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.460
Okay, well, I'm sure we'll get
to Taco Tina

09:08.660 --> 09:11.260
when you're finished
with your yogurt. (chuckles)

09:11.460 --> 09:13.600
- And your arts and crafts.
- Right.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.920
And being a father to Millicent.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.510
Hi, Carly.
Sorry I'm late.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.940
Oh, hey, no problem.
The streets are a mess.

09:23.140 --> 09:24.840
I hate winters in Seattle
with all the...

09:25.040 --> 09:27.100
- Murder.
- What?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.970
So, how's the Froyo here?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.650
Well, I used to have
this favorite flavor

09:32.850 --> 09:35.590
that I would always get because
I knew I could count on it,

09:35.790 --> 09:38.490
but now I don't know
if I can count on him.

09:38.690 --> 09:40.530
I mean <i>it.</i>

09:40.730 --> 09:43.030
I know exactly what to do.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.730
Sir, we'd like one
of everything.

09:45.930 --> 09:49.070
Every flavor?
You'd do that for me?

09:49.270 --> 09:53.110
We can find a new favorite
together.

09:53.310 --> 09:56.120
I have a good feeling
about this one.

10:01.730 --> 10:04.020
(both grunt)

10:04.220 --> 10:07.870
- Not that one.
- That is curdled.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.770
Carly, don't take this
personally,

10:20.970 --> 10:24.700
but I hate all your
contributions to our apartment.

10:24.900 --> 10:28.470
My new guy made me a canoe.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.010
Your new guy?

10:30.210 --> 10:32.510
I told you to get under
somebody, not boo'd up.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.710
And definitely not canoed up.

10:34.910 --> 10:39.690
Wouldn't it be crazy if
I met my soulmate on Scraps?

10:39.890 --> 10:42.810
Yes, that would be crazy.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.790
Carly, you said he didn't get
any of your jokes.

10:45.990 --> 10:48.840
Come on, Harper,
let me have this.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.050
Whatever. Free canoe.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.100
I bought a horrible business
so I can lose money

10:59.300 --> 11:00.410
and feel regular.

11:00.610 --> 11:01.510
You're both invited
to the opening.

11:01.710 --> 11:03.780
Did you know you're in a canoe?

11:03.980 --> 11:05.410
Did you know
you're dressed like

11:05.610 --> 11:07.450
the president of
the Teletubbies?

11:07.650 --> 11:09.080
This is my nap cape.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.750
Maybe I shouldn't have been
so mean to Freddie

11:10.950 --> 11:12.850
about those night pants.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.350
If you want to seem average,

11:14.550 --> 11:16.050
maybe consider
a different outfit.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.820
And consider it I shall.
When next you see me,

11:18.020 --> 11:21.180
I will present as
an "av-er-ahj."

11:22.180 --> 11:23.330
I got to be out, too.

11:23.530 --> 11:25.900
I'm meeting Tinsley
in my apartment.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.550
- Wait, this is your apartment.
- Not today.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.600
Welcome to my spacious,

11:32.810 --> 11:35.670
purposely masculine condo.

11:35.870 --> 11:38.510
Wow, it's like a house
inside a building

11:38.710 --> 11:40.850
with other houses.

11:41.050 --> 11:43.080
I can't wait to show you
these new looks,

11:43.280 --> 11:45.180
of which I'm sure you'll
love every single one

11:45.380 --> 11:48.350
with no ulterior motive.

11:48.550 --> 11:52.540
(phony laughter)

11:55.140 --> 11:58.830
Um, Spencer, what are you doing
in <i>my</i> apartment

11:59.030 --> 12:01.900
on the one day I told you
not to be here?

12:02.100 --> 12:04.500
(New York accent):
Uh, Spencer? You mean John.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.910
Most average name
in the U.S. of A.

12:07.110 --> 12:09.070
And you know Harper because...

12:09.270 --> 12:10.610
Oh, I'm her handyman.

12:10.810 --> 12:13.950
I fix everything in this
fancy place of hers.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.650
If it isn't the gold toilet,
it's the diamond bidet.

12:16.850 --> 12:18.850
Fuggedaboudit!

12:19.050 --> 12:23.190
Well, if everything's fixed,
you can go now, Johnny.

12:23.390 --> 12:25.890
Okay, but before I go,
let me just say

12:26.090 --> 12:29.060
all this art here,
it speaks to me,

12:29.260 --> 12:30.330
the average man.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.730
I go home to my plain
but loving wife

12:32.930 --> 12:33.930
and my 2.5 kids--

12:34.130 --> 12:35.570
also plain, not so loving--

12:35.770 --> 12:37.940
I feel better about
my whole existence.

12:38.140 --> 12:42.340
All because of this
100% relatable art.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.340
Oh!

12:44.540 --> 12:46.140
(normal voice):
Oh, hey, Harper, remember,
my club opening is tonight.

12:46.340 --> 12:48.710
- I'd love to see you there.
- Did you lose your accent?

12:48.910 --> 12:50.870
(New York accent):
Fuggedaboudit!

12:56.070 --> 13:00.730
Sister Axe 2: Axe in the Habit.

13:00.930 --> 13:03.130
You bought a <i>Sister Act</i> themed
axe-throwing bar?

13:03.330 --> 13:06.460
(normal voice):
Yup. I'm gonna lose
some real money on this one.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.770
(New York accent):
Oh, but until then, hey,
what better place

13:08.970 --> 13:11.440
for a regular guy
to drink a beer?

13:11.640 --> 13:15.660
* <i>And throw an axe</i>
<i>for America.</i> *

13:19.260 --> 13:21.950
Millicent, where did you
get those?

13:22.150 --> 13:25.150
My allowance, my business.

13:25.350 --> 13:27.550
Oh, and when I'm axing,
don't call me Millicent.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.700
Call me Minnesota Slim.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.830
Hey, Carly.
Hey, Superman.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.630
I call you Superman
because, well,

13:35.830 --> 13:37.600
you've seen yourself
in a mirror?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.360
I have.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.070
Hey, uh, why don't you
go get yourself a drink

13:41.270 --> 13:43.170
so we can talk about
how cute you are?

13:43.370 --> 13:44.950
Yes, and.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.570
After my second date
with Carly, I read

13:47.770 --> 13:49.270
the Wikipedia page for comedy.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.080
It's funny stuff.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.030
(girls giggle)

13:56.700 --> 13:58.450
Isn't Troy so sweet?

13:58.650 --> 14:01.900
I've seen that Wikipedia page,
and it is long.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.190
You almost got my face.

14:05.390 --> 14:07.730
If Troy's so sweet,
why are you looking at

14:07.930 --> 14:11.200
Freddie and Puddles?
Prune.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.130
What is her name?

14:13.330 --> 14:15.970
I'm looking because
I'm so happy for them.

14:16.170 --> 14:18.040
But I'm even happier for me.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.710
And to celebrate
our collective happiness,

14:20.910 --> 14:22.410
I am going to march
right over there

14:22.610 --> 14:24.210
and love Pearl's shoes.

14:24.410 --> 14:25.810
- Carly, you wouldn't.
- But I would.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.010
We both know what that means.

14:27.210 --> 14:29.150
Yes. That I am comfortable--

14:29.350 --> 14:32.320
nay, that I celebrate
their relationship

14:32.520 --> 14:34.850
because I have moved on
to a celebratory relationship

14:35.050 --> 14:37.960
of my own with
Harrison Jesus Ford.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.160
Or it's a Trojan horse
of a compliment

14:42.360 --> 14:44.730
meant to trick
your ex's new girlfriend

14:44.930 --> 14:46.000
into thinking that you're
chill about them dating,

14:46.200 --> 14:48.500
when really you are
dying inside.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.200
Except I'm not dying inside
because in this situation

14:51.400 --> 14:53.110
he is not my ex,
I legit love Pearl's shoes,

14:53.310 --> 14:54.940
and I have never been so alive.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.180
Now hold my purse!

14:57.380 --> 14:59.540
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Carly.

14:59.740 --> 15:03.470
Thanks for the yarn.
It saved our relationship.

15:04.730 --> 15:08.320
I just came over to say...

15:08.520 --> 15:10.660
I love your shoes.

15:10.860 --> 15:14.460
You love my shoes?

15:14.660 --> 15:16.260
That is so sweet of you, Carly.

15:16.460 --> 15:19.000
And here, I told her
not to wear socks with sandals.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.770
But I'm not a fashionista,
like you two.

15:21.970 --> 15:25.540
Well, I am so glad
you didn't listen, Pearl,

15:25.740 --> 15:31.260
because I love your shoes.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.680
Carly!

15:34.880 --> 15:35.850
Is this the big stack
of pancakes

15:36.050 --> 15:37.620
who built you the canoe?

15:37.820 --> 15:39.780
Guilty.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.970
(awkward laughter)

15:48.680 --> 15:52.230
Wow, you actually showed up.

15:52.430 --> 15:54.230
It's Saturday night,
and Rihanna's not free

15:54.430 --> 15:57.240
'cause she's busy
with her "baby."

15:57.440 --> 16:00.310
Who needs babies?
Get a puppy.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.640
At least you can
put it in your purse.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.130
My mother raised me
in a purse.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.850
So, my guy, what do you
like building more,

16:11.050 --> 16:13.590
tables or those muscles
you got?

16:13.790 --> 16:15.520
(laughs)

16:15.720 --> 16:18.260
Was that comedy?

16:18.460 --> 16:19.870
Not really.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.160
I feel like you just
made that weird.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.660
What is your problem
with them dating?

16:24.860 --> 16:26.760
No problem. I'm problem-free.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.730
I got 99 problems,
but Carly ain't one.

16:29.930 --> 16:33.010
- Oh, so I'm your 99 problems?
- No.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.540
And neither is this situation.

16:34.740 --> 16:35.810
I am comfortable with--

16:36.010 --> 16:37.440
nay, I celebrate
Carly's new relationship.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.990
Now hold my axe!

16:40.860 --> 16:43.720
Hey, I think that
you are a great guy.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.780
In fact, you know what?

16:45.980 --> 16:48.070
I love your shoes.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.410
(roaring)

17:01.620 --> 17:04.120
Damn, I missed.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.940
- What is with you two?
- There is no "us two."

17:12.140 --> 17:13.080
I chose you.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.180
Oh, did you?
No one told Pearl.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.950
Pearl! With a "P."

17:18.150 --> 17:19.380
I know what you're doing.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.190
Loving my shoes is
a Trojan horse of a compliment

17:21.390 --> 17:23.020
meant to trick me into thinking
you're chill

17:23.220 --> 17:25.590
about me and Freddie when really
you are dying inside.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.590
Damn, I called that
word for word.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.000
You two are obsessed
with each other.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.900
But ask yourselves,
when does Pearl

17:33.100 --> 17:34.930
get to belly up
to the love buffet?

17:35.130 --> 17:36.600
Pearl's hungry, too.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.140
You know what?

17:38.340 --> 17:40.070
You suck,

17:40.270 --> 17:42.340
and you suck.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.410
You definitely suck,

17:44.610 --> 17:46.710
and you're, you're just mean.

17:46.910 --> 17:48.480
I'm an acquired taste.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.980
And you...

17:51.180 --> 17:52.920
Oh, that is a hefty bun.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.950
(Troy laughs hard)

17:56.150 --> 17:57.190
I'm sorry, Carly,

17:57.390 --> 17:58.690
it's really important
that I be with

17:58.890 --> 18:00.490
someone funny,
and what Pearl said was funny

18:00.690 --> 18:02.940
because it's true.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.930
Pearl's gonna eat tonight.

18:06.130 --> 18:09.680
Uh, you can keep the canoe,
but don't get it wet.

18:17.290 --> 18:20.080
I guess we're breakup buddies.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.880
What is Troy's last name?

18:23.080 --> 18:25.200
Canoe.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.150
Yeah, it's not the same.

18:29.350 --> 18:32.960
But now you'll have more time
for <i>iCarly.</i>

18:33.160 --> 18:37.200
Really? I just got dumped
by my girlfriend of a year,

18:37.400 --> 18:41.900
and you're thinking about
how it helps you?! Wow.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.140
Freddie, wait.

18:44.340 --> 18:49.260
So, I guess old Minnesota Slim's
gonna need a ride home.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.550
25-cent beers.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.950
I usually throw quarters
in the trash.

18:57.150 --> 18:59.580
My child, your card has been
super declined.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.350
Have a blessed day.

19:01.550 --> 19:06.190
Ah, yes, that's just because
the minimum charge is $75,000.

19:06.390 --> 19:07.730
Harper, please.

19:07.930 --> 19:09.590
I wasn't born yesterday.

19:09.790 --> 19:11.630
I've been out of the purse
for years.

19:11.830 --> 19:13.700
You didn't get
a skull replacement,

19:13.900 --> 19:16.100
and that handyman
is not from New York.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.100
(New York accent):
Oh, you talking to me?

19:18.300 --> 19:20.190
Bodega.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.240
You knew?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.810
That's why you were pretending
to like everything.

19:27.010 --> 19:29.780
You were a bully then,
and you're a bully now.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.620
Gathering information
about my pathetic life

19:31.820 --> 19:32.920
so you can tell everyone
that I have

19:33.120 --> 19:35.820
a credit card with a limit.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.660
What are you talking about?
I love your ideas.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.260
And you bullied me.

19:40.460 --> 19:43.230
You told the entire school
my Prada was a frauda.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.560
You told the entire school
that my au pair

19:45.760 --> 19:46.730
was from Wisconsin.

19:46.930 --> 19:48.200
An au pair from Eau Claire?

19:48.400 --> 19:49.600
How could I not dare?

19:49.800 --> 19:50.940
You were such a bitch.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.370
<i>You</i> were
such a bitch.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.640
Well, guess what, I still am.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.630
Well, guess what, so am I.

20:02.360 --> 20:07.120
Wait, did you only hire me
because you wanted to kiss me

20:07.320 --> 20:08.290
this whole time?

20:08.490 --> 20:09.750
(scoffs)
I can't believe it took you

20:09.950 --> 20:12.670
this long to figure it out,
you stupid bitch.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.180
(knock on door)

20:17.410 --> 20:19.000
Coconut-passion fruit-
peanut butter

20:19.200 --> 20:22.770
with gummy bears, marshmallow
sauce, and bagel chips.

20:22.970 --> 20:24.240
I know you're
a mint chip guy now,

20:24.440 --> 20:27.410
but this used to always
cheer you up.

20:27.610 --> 20:31.280
Thanks.

20:31.480 --> 20:36.050
Mmm. Screw you, baby Mr. Peanut.

20:36.250 --> 20:37.480
What do you want?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.180
To apologize.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.320
I'm listening.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.960
I was being selfish.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.290
I was just excited
to have my Freddie back

20:46.490 --> 20:50.530
so we could make
Captain American Cheese

20:50.730 --> 20:51.860
and do Taco Tina's...

20:52.060 --> 20:53.870
You know, I think
before we do any of that,

20:54.070 --> 20:55.500
we actually need
to listen to Pearl.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.570
Freddie, the peanuts cannot
feel you eating them.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.820
No.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.540
Pearl was right
when she said that

21:04.740 --> 21:06.340
we have an unhealthy
relationship.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.850
What?!
We're so healthy.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.150
I mean, my blood's, like,
12% cheese right now,

21:11.350 --> 21:14.120
but come on, we're
Freddie and Carly.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.150
Yeah, but now Carly and Freddie
are hurting other people

21:17.360 --> 21:18.390
and each other.

21:18.590 --> 21:22.630
I mean, we're a mess.
We got to fix it.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.330
How?

21:24.530 --> 21:26.600
Are we supposed to go back
to the way things were

21:26.800 --> 21:27.700
when we were kids?

21:27.900 --> 21:29.100
Uh, you mean

21:29.300 --> 21:30.670
where I follow you around
like a puppy,

21:30.870 --> 21:32.240
and you take me for granted?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.090
No, thank you.

21:35.390 --> 21:38.330
We got to figure out how
to be friends as adults.

21:40.230 --> 21:42.680
Adult friends.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.880
I can work with that.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.250
I can work with anything

21:47.450 --> 21:51.320
as long as we're still
Freddie and Carly.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.140
It's Carly and Freddie.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.950
Bye.

22:10.260 --> 22:13.460
(door shuts)

22:14.960 --> 22:17.520
Hmm. That was weird.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.440
I got to call my knee guy.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.520
Damn you, gods!

22:26.720 --> 22:30.530
Why have you cursed me
with unconditional success?!

22:30.730 --> 22:33.670
Fuggedaboudit!

22:33.870 --> 22:35.530
Johnny Cakes.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.370
Mini Slim.

22:37.570 --> 22:39.850
Spencer, I need a ride home.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.720
Ooh!
