00:07.800 --> 00:10.000
I suppose it all started with the snow.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.500
You see, it's a very special kind of snow.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.800
A snow to make the happy
happier and the giddy even giddier.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.300
A snow to make a homecoming homier

00:23.300 --> 00:27.500
and natural enemies friends, naturally.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.900
For it was the first
snow of the season.

00:30.300 --> 00:36.300
And as any child can tell you, there's a
certain magic to the very first snow...

00:36.300 --> 00:39.700
...Ã¶zellikle Noel arifesinde yaÃ°Ã½yorsa.

00:40.300 --> 00:44.800
especially when it falls on
the day before Christmas.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.900
For when the first snow
is also a Christmas snow,

00:46.900 --> 00:48.800
well, something wonderful
is bound to happen![Laughing]

00:56.400 --> 01:00.600
[Ruler tapping] Children, back to
your seats. The snow can wait.

01:01.100 --> 01:06.600
Now, now. I've hired professor
Hinkle, the magician,

01:06.700 --> 01:11.900
to entertain at today's class
Christmas party, so pay attention!

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Now, Professor Hinkle was just
about the worst magician in the world.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.900
And so, I put the magic eggs in to my hat.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.500
Abracadabra, to coin a phrase... [Laugh]

01:32.700 --> 01:36.000
And voila the eggs have turned in to...

01:40.600 --> 01:44.200
Messy messy messy.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.100
[Children groan]

01:49.300 --> 01:51.800
Where IS that rabbit?

01:52.100 --> 01:54.800
Hocus Pocus! Where are you?

01:55.600 --> 02:00.600
Bah, the only thing this hat's
good for is the trash can!

[Hinkle grumbles]

02:29.000 --> 02:34.900
Hey, look at the snow! It's cold and snowy!
It's the best kind of snow! [etc.]

02:40.400 --> 02:44.300
We're building a snowman, Karen.
You make the head!

02:44.800 --> 02:49.200
The head is the most difficult part,
ask anyone!

02:50.100 --> 02:55.700
What will we call him?
Should we call him Harold? Nah.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.200
[Mumbling]? Oh, No.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.800
Oatmeal? Oatmeal?!

03:02.800 --> 03:06.300
How about... Frosty?

03:06.900 --> 03:08.300
Frosty?

03:08.500 --> 03:12.200
Yeah! Frosty it is. Frosty the snowman!

03:12.100 --> 03:15.200
[Cheers]

03:15.500 --> 03:21.200
[Frosty the snowman,
what a happy, jolly soul.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.900
With a corn-cob pipe and a button
nose, and two eyes made out of coal.]

03:26.900 --> 03:29.200
Frosty the snow -

03:29.200 --> 03:31.900
Come back here, you!

03:41.400 --> 03:44.300
Happy Birthday!

03:45.300 --> 03:50.100
That hat brought Frosty to life.
It must be magic.

03:50.500 --> 03:54.200
Magic? My hat, magic?

03:54.900 --> 03:56.300
Just look.

03:57.600 --> 04:02.000
If that hat is magic, I want it back.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.600
But it's not yours anymore!
You threw it away!

04:05.700 --> 04:10.400
Don't talk back to your elders,
you naughty naughty little girl.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.200
And you, stay in there, or
there will be no carrots for Christmas.

04:15.700 --> 04:19.600
But you can't take that hat back,
it brought Frosty to life

04:20.000 --> 04:21.500
You saw it happen!
I saw nothing of the kind.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.000
I saw nothing of the kind.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.400
[Chattering]

04:25.400 --> 04:29.700
Quiet, I can't lose that hat
if it's really got magic now!

04:29.800 --> 04:32.900
It'll make me a billionaire magician!

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
But we saw Frosty come to life,
didn't we? Uh-huh, we sure did.

04:39.300 --> 04:43.000
You silly children believe
everything you see.

04:43.200 --> 04:48.500
When you're grown up you'll realize
that snowmen can't come to life.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.000
But we -

04:50.100 --> 04:53.800
Silly, silly silly!

04:56.400 --> 05:02.200
Aw, Frosty, we don't care what grown-ups
say, we know you DID come to life.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.000
We know, Frosty. We just know.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.300
#Frosty the snowman,
was a jolly, happy soul.

05:10.300 --> 05:16.300
With a corn-cob pipe and a button
nose, and two eyes made out of coal.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.000
# Frosty the snowman is
a fairy-tale they say.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.900
He was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day.

05:36.500 --> 05:41.300
Now, of course, the hat did belong to
Frosty and the children.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.700
That part must be made very clear.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.300
Therefore, Hocus Pocus was entirely in
the right in what he was about to do.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.900
Well, Hocus Pocus raced back to the
children just as fast as he could.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.600
[Hocus Pocus whistles]

06:15.500 --> 06:21.000
Look! The hat's back. Let's see
if it will make Frosty alive again.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.900
Happy Birthday!

06:31.500 --> 06:37.400
Hey, I said my first words...
But snowmen can't talk.

06:40.200 --> 06:46.200
Alright, come on now, what's the joke.
Could I really be alive?

06:46.400 --> 06:51.100
I mean, I can make words, I can move.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.700
I can juggle, I can
sweep, I can count to 10.

06:56.300 --> 07:02.100
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 8...
Well, I can count to 5. [laughing]

07:07.300 --> 07:13.200
What do you know? I'm even ticklish.
In fact, I'm all living. I am alive!

07:15.400 --> 07:20.100
What a neat thing to happen
to a nice guy like me. [Children cheer]

07:20.200 --> 07:25.500
#There must have been some
magic in that old silk hat they found.

07:25.500 --> 07:30.900
# For when they placed it on
his head he began to dance around.

07:31.300 --> 07:34.700
# Frosty the snowman was
alive as he could be and

07:34.700 --> 07:40.600
the children say he could laugh and
play just the same as you and me.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.600
Uh oh...

07:47.600 --> 07:49.700
What's the matter, Frosty?

07:49.700 --> 07:52.600
Whew, is there a thermometer around here?

07:52.700 --> 07:55.400
Over there on the wall, why?

07:58.800 --> 08:04.700
Oh, I was afraid of that. The thermomter is
getting red. I hate red thermometers.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.800
Why, Frosty?

08:06.800 --> 08:10.400
'Cause when the thermometer gets
all reddish, the temperature goes up.

08:10.500 --> 08:15.800
And when the temperature goes up,
I start to melt. And when I start to melt...

08:16.300 --> 08:18.200
I get all wishy washy!

08:18.500 --> 08:21.600
Then you've gotta go some
place where you'll never melt.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.900
The only place I'd never
melt is the north pole.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.200
Then we've got to get you there!

08:27.600 --> 08:33.299
Yeah, we'll take you downtown to
the railroad station and put you on a train.

08:33.400 --> 08:38.200
Great, I always wanted to see the town.
Let's make a party out of it!

08:38.600 --> 08:40.299
Let's have a parade!

08:44.200 --> 08:49.200
# Frosty the snowman knew
the sun was hot that day,

08:49.200 --> 08:55.200
so he said let's run and we'll have
some fun now before I melt away.

09:19.800 --> 09:25.800
# Down to the village with a
broomstick in his hand, running

09:27.400 --> 09:33.300
here and there all around the
square, saying catch me if you can.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.600
Come on kids, follow the leader!

09:38.900 --> 09:44.900
# He led them down the streets
of town right to the traffic cop,

09:46.600 --> 09:52.500
and he only paused a moment
when he heard him holler stop.

09:54.300 --> 09:59.700
[Cop blows whistle] Stop. Stop. Stop!

09:59.800 --> 10:02.800
Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.700
What's a traffic light?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.400
Up there on the lamp post!

10:06.500 --> 10:08.100
What's a lamp post?

10:08.100 --> 10:11.200
Oh, do you want a ticket, wise guy?

10:11.400 --> 10:14.400
I'd love one, to the north pole, please!

10:15.800 --> 10:17.800
You've got to excuse him, sir.
Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?

10:17.900 --> 10:23.100
You see, he just came to life and
he doesn't know much about such things.

10:23.700 --> 10:28.500
Oh, well, okay, if he just came to life.
[Cop blows whistle] Move along!

10:29.200 --> 10:32.700
Them silly snowmen. Once they come
to life they don't know nothing.

10:34.100 --> 10:39.900
Come to life?! [Soft whistling]

10:54.500 --> 10:59.500
[Snoring]

10:59.500 --> 11:00.200
[Snoring]

11:00.200 --> 11:03.800
We'd like a ticket to the north pole please.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.500
Hmm... What? Yes.
The north pole? Oh, yes ma'am.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.500
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]

11:19.700 --> 11:23.800
Route you by the way of
Saskatchewan, Hudson Bay,

11:23.800 --> 11:27.900
Nome Alaska, the Klondike,
and Aurora Borealis!

11:28.300 --> 11:31.700
Gotta make a change at
Nanuk of the Northville.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.900
That'll be $3,000 and
four cents, including tax.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.700
Oh, but we don't have any money...

11:40.200 --> 11:45.100
No money!?
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]

11:45.900 --> 11:49.000
No money, no ticket! [Slam!]

11:49.400 --> 11:53.700
[Sad music plays]

11:53.700 --> 11:56.000
Now I'll never get to the north pole.

11:56.300 --> 12:00.200
Oh, Frosty, you just can't melt!

12:00.500 --> 12:04.000
Oh, Karen, don't you get all slushy too.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.900
What is it, Hocus? Out the window?

12:13.100 --> 12:18.700
A refrigerated boxcar
on a train headed north.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.500
You'll be safe there, Frosty! Come on!

12:27.400 --> 12:31.400
It's full of ice cream and
frozen Christmas cakes.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
What a neat way to travel!

12:33.900 --> 12:39.300
[Whistle blows]

12:41.800 --> 12:44.700
Hurry up, Frosty, the train is pulling out!

12:46.400 --> 12:48.300
Are you coming to the north pole, too?

12:48.800 --> 12:53.600
I'm sure my mother won't mind, as
long as I'm home in time for supper.

12:56.500 --> 13:01.100
[Whistle blows]

13:05.900 --> 13:09.700
# Frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way,

13:09.600 --> 13:15.500
but he waved goodbye saying don't
cry. I'll be back again some day.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.700
I must get that hat back.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.900
Think, nasty, think, nasty,
think nasty. [Evil laughter].

13:25.200 --> 13:31.100
# He'll be back again some daaaaaaaaaay.

13:36.100 --> 13:41.200
Now actually, a refrigerated
boxcar is a splendid way to travel.

13:41.600 --> 13:47.000
Splendid that is... if one is a
snowman or a furry coated rabbit.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.800
But for Karen...

13:50.400 --> 13:53.700
[Sneeze] Are you cold, Karen?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.300
Now that's a silly question.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.600
You wouldn't be sneezing
if you weren't cold.

13:59.100 --> 14:05.000
Well... just... just a lit... little.
[Sneeze]

14:06.500 --> 14:10.900
Frosty realized that Karen had to
get out of that car as soon as possible.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.200
So when the little
freight train stopped to

14:16.200 --> 14:19.500
let an express full of happy
Christmas travelers pass,

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Frosty took advantage of the
opportunity and quickly got them all off.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Oh, you tricked me! No fair!

14:34.600 --> 14:38.700
The only thing professor Hinkle
could do was make a jump for it.

14:39.600 --> 14:45.500
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]

14:52.100 --> 14:57.900
[Howling wind]

14:58.700 --> 15:02.600
Frosty wanted to get as far away
as he could before Hinkle woke up.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.400
[Hocus' teeth chatter]

15:10.800 --> 15:13.000
[Sneeze]

15:13.700 --> 15:18.600
But the woods through which
they traveled were still bitterly cold.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.200
Hocus, I've got to get Karen
all warmed up or she's a gonner!

15:28.500 --> 15:33.800
I can't make a fire. Oh boy,
that's one thing I really can't do.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.000
I guess we just better keep
moving until we find somebody who can.

15:39.500 --> 15:44.800
Then suddenly they came upon a
tiny glen which seemed almost magical.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.500
For it was Christmas
eve and the woodland

15:49.500 --> 15:52.800
animals were all decorating
for their big celebration.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.600
They knew Santa was to come that night

15:56.600 --> 15:59.700
and they wanted everything
to be just right.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.800
Hocus, speak to the animals.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.500
See if they won't all pitch
in and build a fire for Karen.

16:11.100 --> 16:16.900
[Squeaky noises]

16:17.900 --> 16:20.900
The animals were delighted to help.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.000
so they found a spot away from the glen

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
where the fire wouldn't
catch on to the trees.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.700
Soon there was a spark and in almost

16:31.700 --> 16:35.200
no time a splendid
fire was crackling away.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.300
Frosty was careful to stay
far away from the flames.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.300
Hocus, we've got to find someone
to help Karen get home before she freezes.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.600
And me to the north pole
before I melt, but who?

17:03.900 --> 17:06.099
No, not the Marines.

17:09.099 --> 17:12.099
No, not the president of the United States.

17:12.700 --> 17:16.900
Oh, they were both swell ideas,
but we've got to find someone nearby.

17:22.400 --> 17:28.200
Yeah, Santa Claus. That's a great idea.
Why didn't I think of that before?

17:32.100 --> 17:37.300
Hocus, you go back with the animals and
when Santa comes, you bring him right here.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.400
Understand?

17:40.600 --> 17:41.900
Hurry now!

17:49.900 --> 17:52.200
So Frosty kept a silent vigil,

17:53.100 --> 17:57.400
waiting patiently all through the
night until Santa would arrive.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.600
But suddenly...

17:59.700 --> 18:02.400
Oh, a campfire.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.000
Well isn't that all snug and comfy?
[Evil laughter]

18:08.000 --> 18:08.800
[Professor Hinkle blows]

18:08.800 --> 18:10.600
No! Don't!

18:10.800 --> 18:13.700
Now give me that hat or else!

18:14.100 --> 18:15.900
Or else what?

18:16.000 --> 18:20.800
Well don't bother me with details,
give me that hat!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.200
Get on my shoulders, Karen!

18:24.600 --> 18:28.600
You see, Frosty, since
he was made of snow

18:28.600 --> 18:32.600
himself was the fastest
belly-whopper in the world.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.700
And old professor Hinkle
was soon far outdistanced.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.800
And now it was Frosty's
good fortune that right

18:52.800 --> 18:56.000
at the bottom of the
hill was a tiny greenhouse

18:56.400 --> 19:02.100
used to grow precious tropical
poinsettias for Christmas.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.000
It's got to be all warm and snug inside

19:06.000 --> 19:08.500
for those Christmas flowers
to grow so beautiful.

19:08.800 --> 19:09.700
Let's go in.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.900
Oh, but, but you will melt!

19:14.400 --> 19:17.600
Just a little. I'll only stay
inside for a minute.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.200
Besides, I've been meaning to
take off a little weight anyway.

19:25.500 --> 19:30.000
Whew, stay in here much longer and
I'll really make a splash in the world.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.700
Now I've got you, and the minute you're

19:44.700 --> 19:48.800
all melted the hat will
be mine! [Evil laughter]

19:52.000 --> 19:55.300
Santa had arrived but was he too late?

20:02.400 --> 20:08.200
Hocus explained the situation to Santa,
who (as you know) speaks a fluent rabbit.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.600
And when they didn't find
Frosty and Karen on the hill...

20:14.100 --> 20:18.100
Santa followed Frosty's path in
the snow to the greenhouse.

20:19.600 --> 20:24.200
But when they got inside,
a terrible sight met their eyes.

20:25.500 --> 20:31.400
[Karen weeping]
[Sad music plays]

20:42.900 --> 20:48.800
# (Very slowly) Frosty
the snowman was a happy,

20:51.100 --> 20:57.100
jolly soul with a corn-cob pipe and a
button nose and two eyes made out of coal.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.500
They were too late.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.500
Too late? Why, nonsense!

21:18.400 --> 21:23.500
Don't cry, Karen.
Frosty's not gone for good.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.600
You see, he was made out of Christmas snow

21:27.000 --> 21:30.500
and Christmas snow can
never disappear completely.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.800
Oh, it sometimes goes away
for almost a year at a time

21:35.800 --> 21:39.800
and takes the form of
Spring and Summer rain,

21:39.800 --> 21:43.100
but you can bet your boots that

21:43.100 --> 21:46.400
when a good jolly
December wind kisses it,

21:46.400 --> 21:50.300
it will turn in to Christmas
snow all over again!

21:50.900 --> 21:55.300
Yes, but he was my friend.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.700
[Chuckle] Just watch.

22:09.400 --> 22:14.400
Wait a minute!
I want that hat and I want it now!

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
Don't you dare touch that!

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
And just what are YOU going to do about it?

22:21.500 --> 22:24.100
If you so much as lay a finger on the brim,

22:24.700 --> 22:29.400
I'll never bring you another
Christmas present as long as you live.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.300
Never?

22:32.500 --> 22:34.100
Never!

22:34.600 --> 22:39.800
No more trick cards or magic balls or...

22:39.800 --> 22:41.900
No more anything.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.100
Oh, that's not fair.

22:45.700 --> 22:50.400
I mean, we evil magicians
have to make a living too.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.200
Now you go home and
write "I am very sorry

22:54.200 --> 22:58.000
for what I did to Frosty"
a hundred zillion times.

22:58.300 --> 23:01.500
And then maybe, just maybe, mind you...

23:01.900 --> 23:05.100
you'll find something in your
stocking tomorrow morning.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.400
A new hat maybe?

23:08.500 --> 23:11.800
Oh, yes sir. Goodbye everyone.

23:11.800 --> 23:16.100
Sorry to lose and run,
but I've got to get busy writing.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.400
Busy busy busy!

23:22.600 --> 23:25.500
Come on, Frosty, we're all waiting for you.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.500
Happy Birthday!

23:32.400 --> 23:36.000
#Frosty the snowman is
a fairy-tale they say.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
He was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.300
And so Santa took Karen home and made

23:49.300 --> 23:52.800
ready to bring Frosty
back to the north pole.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.600
Karen hated to say goodbye to Frosty,

23:58.600 --> 24:03.800
but as Santa promised, Frosty returned every
year with the magical Christmas snow.

24:04.800 --> 24:09.400
And every year there was a great
celebration with a great Christmas parade.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.100
#Thumpity thump thump thumpity
thump. Look at that Frosty go.

24:19.100 --> 24:24.300
Thumpity thump thump thumpity
thump. Over the hills of snow.

24:25.100 --> 24:30.500
#Frosty the snowman,
was a jolly, happy soul.

24:30.500 --> 24:35.800
With a corn-cob pipe and a button
nose, and two eyes made out of coal.

24:37.300 --> 24:42.700
And with Frosty the snowman,
Christmas was always very merry indeed.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.100
You have a merry Christmas too!

24:47.500 --> 24:53.000
#Frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way,

24:53.000 --> 24:58.400
but he waved goodbye
saying don't you cry.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.300
I'll be back on Christmas day!

25:03.305 --> 25:09.220
