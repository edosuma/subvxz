00:02.961 --> 00:04.922
It's gonna crash.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.217
Are you saying these men are clones?

00:08.300 --> 00:10.886
Unless you protect us, we are already dead.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.389
- Who is Mom talking to?
- Your sister.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.059
I'm in danger, Fox.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.984
- Scully.
- Scully, it's me. Where are you?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.654
Scully? Are you there?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.450
Scully?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.383
Sir.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.219
Captain.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.559
- What have you got?
- I'm not sure, sir.

00:58.642 --> 01:02.229
We picked up some paint
approximately two minutes ago.

01:03.522 --> 01:07.276
- Looks like it's just hanging there.
- It's 200 metres below the ice.

01:07.359 --> 01:10.445
Looks to be about 80 metres across
and it's noisy.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.282
- Noisy how?
- It's emitting radio signals...

01:13.365 --> 01:17.494
...but it's just random noise, sir.
We can't detect any pattern.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.456
Get me Pacific Command
on the satellite uplink.

01:22.958 --> 01:28.005
Admiral. I don't know what we've found,
but it appears to be some kind of craft.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.758
Yes, sir, that's correct.

01:32.885 --> 01:37.097
But we're on a cartography mission,
Admiral. My crew isn't prepared to...

01:40.350 --> 01:42.227
Yes, sir.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.189
Understood, sir.

01:47.691 --> 01:51.361
Set a course. Heading 047.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.781
Toward the object, sir?

01:54.865 --> 01:58.869
Weapons room. Lock torpedoes on target.
Prepare to fire on command.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.873
- Captain, shouldn't we identify it?
- We have our orders, Lieutenant.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.042
But, sir...

02:17.638 --> 02:19.723
The reactor's gone down.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.894
- Engine room!
- That won't work. We're on battery power.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.147
I'm going down there.
Prepare to surface at once!

02:30.526 --> 02:34.446
Surface into what?
We're under 32 feet of glacial ice.

Episode 17 - End Game

03:32.004 --> 03:34.423
Scully? Are you there?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.344
Scully? What's going on?

03:41.096 --> 03:43.182
No. Sorry.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.062
- Who was that?
- It's a wrong number.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.900
- Where have you been, Mulder?
- I was trying to reach you.

03:52.983 --> 03:57.529
I went by your house, but you weren't there.
I got here as quickly as I could.

03:57.613 --> 04:01.617
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did call. I couldn't get through.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.620
- Put your hands against the wall.
- Scully...

04:04.703 --> 04:06.997
I said put your hands against the wall!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.333
- What's wrong?
- Do it!

04:09.416 --> 04:11.502
Scully, it's me.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.004
I don't know who you are.

04:14.463 --> 04:18.841
I'm gonna take my left hand and reach into
my pocket for my ID, OK? Don't shoot me.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.471
- I got shot once and I didn't much...
- I said keep your hands up!

04:27.976 --> 04:30.062
Where is he?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.568
That was him on the phone, wasn't it?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.489
Tell me where he is.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.409
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.673
Scully!

05:04.763 --> 05:07.057
He's been here.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.698
Your partner is alive. He took her to get me.

05:22.781 --> 05:27.077
- But she wouldn't have just let him in.
- She might not have known who he was.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.788
She might have thought it was you.

05:30.497 --> 05:35.586
He'll contact you. He'll say he wants
to make a trade-your partner's life for mine.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.839
- Why does he want to kill you?
- Because I know how to kill him.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.592
- How?
- By piercing the base of his skull.

05:41.675 --> 05:46.221
- That'll kill anybody.
- Yes, but this is the only way to kill him.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.932
- I'm fairly sure it'll work.
- Fairly sure?

05:49.016 --> 05:53.270
He's got powers I've never seen before.
If it doesn't work, you could die.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.521
From what?

05:54.605 --> 05:57.608
Their blood is toxic.
Human exposure to it is fatal.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.277
- I know this must seem incredible...
- No. No, no.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.114
That's just it. It doesn't seem incredible at all.
How do we find him?

06:04.406 --> 06:07.326
We don't. He'll find us.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.421
- He'll call.
- You're sure.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.382
- I know what he wants.
- And if he doesn't get it?

06:22.466 --> 06:26.386
- I know this is hard for you, Fox.
- No, it's not hard. It's unbelievable.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.723
- You don't believe me.
- After 22 years, why come back?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.976
- I've explained.
- You've explained only what you had to!

06:33.060 --> 06:38.190
I know next to nothing about your so-called
parents or the man who wants to kill them!

06:42.861 --> 06:46.532
The men you've been seeking
are the progeny of two original visitors.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.827
Clones who have been attempting to
establish a colony here since the late 1940s.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.829
- A colony?
- Loosely.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.832
The community, by necessity, is dispersed.

06:55.916 --> 06:59.878
Clones identical to my parents live
in virtually every part of the country.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.964
What are they trying to accomplish?

07:02.047 --> 07:06.009
It's their belief that our stewardship
of the planet is being forsaken...

07:06.093 --> 07:09.555
...and that, by default,
they'll become the natural heirs.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.723
And in the meantime?

07:11.807 --> 07:17.354
Through hybridisation they've been erasing
that aspect which has forced them to scatter:

07:17.437 --> 07:20.107
...their identical natures.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.985
All the clones worked
in abortion clinics. Why?

07:23.068 --> 07:26.947
Access to foetal tissue.
Though the biologies are incompatible...

07:27.030 --> 07:31.410
...they finally found a way
to combine human DNA with alien DNA.

07:33.495 --> 07:37.374
And this man...
Why has he been sent to kill them?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.835
The experiments weren't sanctioned.

07:39.918 --> 07:44.506
It was considered a dilution of
their species, a pollution of their race.

07:44.590 --> 07:49.428
So a bounty hunter was dispatched
to destroy them and terminate the colony.

07:49.511 --> 07:54.349
That's a good story.
But I've heard a lot of good stories lately.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.395
I've got no reason to lie to you.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.567
I'm your sister, Fox. You have to trust me.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.715
Who is it?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.928
Skinner.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.729
- Mulder?
- The door's open.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.295
Make yourself at home.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.676
What's going on, Agent Mulder?
Why are the lights out?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.136
Orders from my ophthalmologist.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.807
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:17.933 --> 09:20.477
I've been trying to reach
you and Agent Scully.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.855
I haven't checked my messages.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.651
Agent Scully incarcerated four men
with the federal marshal's office...

09:27.734 --> 09:30.028
...and those men are now missing.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.198
It's all right. It's not him.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.702
What the hell is going on here, Mulder?

09:36.952 --> 09:40.247
- This is my sister. Samantha Mulder.
- What?

09:40.455 --> 09:43.041
I've no time to explain.
Agent Scully is missing.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.836
What do you mean, missing?

09:48.130 --> 09:50.299
- Hello.
- Mulder, it's me.

09:50.382 --> 09:54.136
- Scully, where are you?
- I don't know. I'm in a telephone booth.

09:54.219 --> 09:58.307
He's got my gun, Mulder. He says he'll kill
me if you don't give him what he wants.

09:58.390 --> 10:02.019
- What does he want?
- A woman who is with you.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.980
He says you'll know what I'm talking about.

10:06.857 --> 10:10.360
- Tell him we'll negotiate.
- He doesn't wanna negotiate.

10:10.444 --> 10:14.531
- He says he wants to make a trade.
- All right, let me speak to him!

10:14.615 --> 10:17.659
He says be at Memorial Bridge
in Bethesda in one hour.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.454
- Scully, I need more time than that.
- Mulder...

10:23.624 --> 10:25.876
Where is she? What's this negotiation?

10:25.959 --> 10:31.006
We don't have any time. If I ever needed
your help, your trust, I need it now.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.152
Mulder's in position.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.034
We just need to make him think
we're gonna make a trade.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.578
- We just need one shot.
- To the base of the neck.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.540
These guys can hollow out
a dime at 200 yards.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.129
Now, Samantha...

11:11.213 --> 11:14.258
Do not take any unnecessary risks out there.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.372
Scully?

11:56.675 --> 11:58.760
Bring her out.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.343
Take your shot when you got it.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.901
Step close. Right up close.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.037
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.206
- Yeah?
- I'm OK.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.353
Samantha!

13:32.646 --> 13:34.690
I lost the shot.

13:37.234 --> 13:41.280
There's no way out.
We got both sides of the bridge covered.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.284
Now let her go!

13:45.909 --> 13:48.620
- Tell me where she is.
- Let her go!

14:04.970 --> 14:07.055
Samantha!

14:10.267 --> 14:12.352
Samantha!

14:19.860 --> 14:21.945
Spread it out.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.949
Clear.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.577
There's some debris under the bridge.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.461
- Mulder...
- You should be in the hospital, Scully.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.796
I was discharged an hour ago.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.091
- Have they found anything yet?
- Nothing yet.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.719
Do you think she could have survived?

14:45.802 --> 14:50.349
- Maybe. But the water's 36º.
- Maybe she went into hypothermic shock.

14:50.432 --> 14:55.854
I've heard about people that have lived after
being in water like this eight to ten hours.

14:55.938 --> 14:59.441
Mulder, why didn't you tell me
on the phone that it was her?

14:59.525 --> 15:02.778
- I couldn't tell you.
- Why not?

15:04.238 --> 15:07.199
Because you'd never
let me go through with it.

15:08.116 --> 15:12.538
- Are you sure that it's your sister?
- Why would you even question me on that?

15:12.788 --> 15:15.958
Because back at the motel it was you.
But it wasn't you.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.126
Well, it was her!

15:18.210 --> 15:21.797
- Then who is this man and where's he...
- He's an alien.

15:23.048 --> 15:26.969
- Is that what you're gonna tell Skinner?
- I already told him. That was easy.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.346
Now I gotta tell my father.

15:35.853 --> 15:39.439
You didn't have me come all this way
to give me good news.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.570
What is it, Fox?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.494
Samantha's gone... Dad.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.624
I lost her.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.047
What do you mean, you lost her?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.137
There was a man.

16:14.099 --> 16:18.353
He was holding my partner hostage
in exchange for Samantha.

16:20.898 --> 16:23.859
You let this man take your sister.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.112
Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?

16:27.196 --> 16:29.740
I can't explain it to you, but, um...

16:31.992 --> 16:34.745
I believed I was doing the right thing, Dad.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.626
Was this your decision?

16:44.296 --> 16:46.381
Yes.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.721
I'll tell Mom.

16:53.222 --> 16:57.851
Do you realise what losing her again
is going to do to your mother?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.858
Do you?

17:14.826 --> 17:17.119
I'm sorry, Dad.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.290
I'm sorry.

17:22.376 --> 17:25.878
I'm... I'm sorry.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.350
Your sis...

17:38.433 --> 17:42.020
Samantha left this at the house for you.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.020
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

18:24.062 --> 18:27.691
Scully, she left a path in case
we got separated. I think she's alive.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.236
Mulder, I think you should come back
as soon as you can.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.405
Why? What'd you find?

18:34.198 --> 18:36.700
It's your sister.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.453
We just pulled her body out of the river.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.251
Mulder, I'm so sorry.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.840
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.844
You know...

18:55.928 --> 18:59.848
Whatever you're feeling,
you can't blame yourself.

18:59.932 --> 19:04.019
What about a second body?
Did you find a second body?

19:04.102 --> 19:06.188
No, not yet.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.816
I'll be there as soon as I can.

19:15.489 --> 19:18.784
- Agent Scully, something you need to see.
- What is it?

19:18.867 --> 19:23.539
It's the body we pulled from the water.
Something strange is happening.

20:27.895 --> 20:32.816
Federal agent. Keep your hands where
I can see them and turn around. Slowly.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.740
Who are you?

20:45.454 --> 20:48.624
- She's dead, isn't she?
- What the hell is going on?

20:48.707 --> 20:51.335
Come, please. There's not much time.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.088
Who are you?

20:55.172 --> 20:57.257
Please.

21:14.816 --> 21:17.402
- It was all a lie.
- We needed your help.

21:17.486 --> 21:22.074
- We knew you could be manipulated.
- He'll be coming. We must hurry now.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.243
Who?

21:26.036 --> 21:28.413
The man who's been sent to kill us.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.543
He's dead.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.879
- How do you know?
- He was shot. In the back of the neck!

21:35.963 --> 21:39.466
- How did he die?
- He fell off a bridge.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.262
With one of you.

21:43.470 --> 21:47.683
Then we don't know for sure.
You could have been followed.

21:47.766 --> 21:50.686
Come with me. This way, Agent Mulder.

22:05.784 --> 22:08.078
The rest of us are dispensable.

22:09.246 --> 22:12.249
She was the first.
The one from which we all came.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.418
The one you must save.

22:22.176 --> 22:26.138
- I'm not your saviour.
- You must help us. You have no choice.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.725
No, I... I do have a choice.

22:31.018 --> 22:33.312
My choice is to walk outta here.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.107
We know where your sister is.

22:37.900 --> 22:42.321
Ask yourself, Agent Mulder, how else
would we know so much about her?

22:46.575 --> 22:48.577
He's here.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.545
I found one!

23:40.796 --> 23:43.382
Sir, we're gonna get you outta here!

23:43.465 --> 23:47.553
- What about the others?
- We got real lucky. There are no others.

23:47.636 --> 23:50.138
No, wait! There were women in here.

23:50.222 --> 23:53.308
- We looked. You're the only one.
- No! Keep looking!

23:58.981 --> 24:01.191
After treatment for smoke inhalation...

24:01.275 --> 24:06.321
...Agent Mulder was released from
Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition.

24:06.405 --> 24:11.034
At his request, the abortion clinic where
he was found has been searched repeatedly...

24:11.118 --> 24:14.746
...but the bodies of the women
he insists perished were not found.

24:14.830 --> 24:17.666
My report on this case remains incomplete.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.961
Many aspects continue to defy explanation...

24:21.044 --> 24:24.673
...including the identities
of the identical men and women.

24:24.756 --> 24:29.261
Agent Mulder's claim of alien origins
cannot be substantiated.

24:29.344 --> 24:32.431
The suspect in their disappearances
is still at large.

24:32.514 --> 24:36.810
He has now been charged with the death
of FBI Special Agent Barrett Weiss...

24:36.894 --> 24:42.065
...whose body is quarantined at the Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.

24:42.149 --> 24:45.194
His cause of death involved
a thickening of the blood.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.697
We now believe he was subjected
to a virulent strain of virus...

24:48.780 --> 24:51.783
...whose origin and behaviour
are also unexplainable.

24:51.867 --> 24:57.789
It is my hope that further analysis of this
contagion will aid in the solution of this case.

24:57.873 --> 25:02.586
- This is a retrovirus?
- Yes. But we've never seen anything like it.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.506
Do you recognise it?

25:05.589 --> 25:09.468
Was the thickening of the blood
an immunological response to the virus?

25:09.551 --> 25:13.972
Apparently. Exposure to it triggers
a massive production of red blood cells.

25:14.056 --> 25:19.645
Take a look at this. We took a second culture
and were able to control its growth.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.188
What did you do?

25:21.271 --> 25:25.067
All we did was lower
the temperature by 5º Fahrenheit.

25:25.150 --> 25:28.487
- So the virus is inhibited by cold.
- Knocked out by it!

25:28.820 --> 25:33.242
For some reason this retrovirus
goes dormant at cold temperatures.

25:34.868 --> 25:38.580
We pulled a body from the river
that was chilled near freezing.

25:38.664 --> 25:42.668
- When it started to thaw, it began to corrode.
- Corrode?

25:42.751 --> 25:46.964
If you find out anything else,
you let me know as soon as possible.

26:02.813 --> 26:05.274
You wanted to see me?

26:05.357 --> 26:08.068
- How was the opera?
- I've never slept better.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.822
I don't like these hasty
public meetings, Agent Mulder.

26:11.905 --> 26:16.451
- I'm sorry. I need your help.
- It's over. The fat lady is singing.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.620
I need to know what you know.

26:18.704 --> 26:21.331
- OK. They're all dead.
- No!

26:21.415 --> 26:26.044
One of them is alive. The one
who was sent to kill them. Where is he?

26:26.128 --> 26:30.215
A nuclear submarine located his craft
in the Beaufort Sea five days ago.

26:30.299 --> 26:33.177
They were ordered to destroy it,
but were disabled.

26:33.260 --> 26:38.974
An attack fleet left Anchorage this morning
to make sure this man does not leave.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.643
I gotta get up there.

26:41.727 --> 26:45.439
You'll only win the war if you pick
the right battles, Agent Mulder.

26:45.522 --> 26:48.025
This is a battle you can't win.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.784
Mulder, it's me. Are you there?

27:37.950 --> 27:42.621
Scully-when you get this message
I'll be too far away for you to stop me...

27:42.704 --> 27:45.832
...but where I'm going
I can't allow you to follow.

27:45.916 --> 27:51.421
I won't let you jeopardise your life and your
career for reasons purely personal to me.

27:51.505 --> 27:55.592
You were right, Scully.
You said a line has to be drawn somewhere.

27:55.676 --> 27:58.428
And I'm drawing it for you here.

27:58.512 --> 28:00.806
I'll contact you when I can.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.436
Sir?

28:09.106 --> 28:13.944
I'm sorry to come unannounced, sir,
but your assistant wasn't at her desk.

28:14.570 --> 28:18.240
- What is it, Scully?
- May we speak off the record, sir?

28:20.325 --> 28:23.078
- About?
- Agent Mulder.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.713
He's gone.

28:33.547 --> 28:37.467
- Where?
- I don't know. I was hoping you'd tell me.

28:38.343 --> 28:43.056
Agent Mulder told me he was going to take
some time off after what he'd been through.

28:43.140 --> 28:48.478
He told me the same thing, but I don't think
this matter with his sister is settled.

28:49.605 --> 28:54.359
Sir, is there any way that you can reach him
through unofficial channels?

28:57.863 --> 29:00.324
- I can't help you, Scully.
- Please!

29:02.075 --> 29:06.788
Agent Scully, you and I both have a greater
responsibility to consider-to the FBI.

29:06.872 --> 29:11.502
Mulder's actions are in violation of his duties,
his oath of trust and Bureau protocol.

29:11.585 --> 29:16.215
- He's risked my position, your life...
- Agent Mulder saved my life!

29:17.633 --> 29:23.013
If he wanted or expected you to do the same,
he would have told you where he was going.

29:28.018 --> 29:31.355
Please close the door
on your way out, Agent Scully.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.531
Where's Mulder?

31:04.615 --> 31:07.659
Sorry. I must have the wrong apartment.

31:10.746 --> 31:12.831
Where's Mulder?

31:13.332 --> 31:17.836
- I need to know, dammit!
- You've mistaken me for someone else.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.005
I'm losing time!

31:25.177 --> 31:27.971
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

31:40.943 --> 31:42.361
Excuse me.

31:42.444 --> 31:44.988
Did you tell her what she needed to know?

31:49.952 --> 31:52.120
How hard do you wanna make this?

31:52.204 --> 31:54.289
No harder than it has to be.

32:09.263 --> 32:11.765
I've killed men for far less.

32:12.641 --> 32:15.727
You pull that trigger,
you'll be killing two men.

32:15.811 --> 32:18.188
Now, I wanna know where Mulder is.

32:25.988 --> 32:28.782
Agent Mulder flew to Tacoma, Washington.

32:28.866 --> 32:32.744
From there he caught a military plane
to Deadhorse, Alaska.

32:35.414 --> 32:38.834
He used his FBI credentials
to charter an all-terrain vehicle.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.795
It's still a ten-mile hike across the ice.

32:41.879 --> 32:45.299
These are the coordinates
of his final destination.

32:50.053 --> 32:53.891
- How did you get this?
- Unofficial channels.

34:55.304 --> 34:57.181
Hey!

35:01.894 --> 35:03.896
Stop!

35:46.438 --> 35:49.316
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Terry Wilmer.

35:49.399 --> 35:51.485
Step outta there!

35:53.612 --> 35:55.697
Come out!

36:02.371 --> 36:04.456
What happened to you?

36:05.874 --> 36:08.168
I don't know. We, uh...

36:09.419 --> 36:11.713
We just lost power.

36:13.131 --> 36:16.385
We... we drifted under the ice for days.

36:17.386 --> 36:19.972
Then, um... then we hit a, uh...

36:20.055 --> 36:22.140
Don't look at me! Face forward!

36:23.267 --> 36:26.311
We hit a shallow patch
and punched through, OK?

36:26.395 --> 36:28.480
That's what happened.

36:29.940 --> 36:32.234
So why did you run?

36:33.318 --> 36:35.612
A man came. He, um...

36:38.407 --> 36:42.494
He sealed most of the men below decks
without any air and, uh...

36:42.578 --> 36:45.664
And then he started to execute the rest of us.

36:47.374 --> 36:49.585
Every... They're all dead.

36:49.668 --> 36:53.714
I, uh... I thought you were him.
I didn't know if you were him.

36:53.797 --> 36:56.300
How is it you managed to survive?

36:59.011 --> 37:02.222
I hid under the body of the chief petty officer.

37:02.306 --> 37:04.641
OK? I, um...

37:04.725 --> 37:07.144
I played dead.

37:11.773 --> 37:14.067
What's this for?

37:14.151 --> 37:17.654
- What, are you crazy?
- No. I'm just tired.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.450
You're not getting back to your ship
until I get the truth.

37:21.533 --> 37:23.827
Tell me where my sister is.

37:23.911 --> 37:27.080
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Base of the neck!

37:27.164 --> 37:32.461
Tell me how I can find her and I'll let you
get back to your ship before it's destroyed!

37:32.544 --> 37:35.881
Please... Please, you're making
a really big mistake.

37:48.143 --> 37:52.272
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you many times before.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.441
Where is she?

37:56.443 --> 38:00.405
Is the answer to your question worth
dying for? Is that what you want?

38:00.489 --> 38:02.574
Where is she?

38:10.666 --> 38:12.709
Just tell me where she is!

38:16.797 --> 38:18.882
She's alive.

38:20.384 --> 38:22.469
Can you die now?

38:31.562 --> 38:33.647
Agh!

40:14.790 --> 40:16.875
No change in BP or pulse.

40:19.545 --> 40:22.422
I'm Dana Scully, his partner.
What are his vitals?

40:22.506 --> 40:26.260
- He's suffering from extreme hypothermia.
- No! Get him out of the tub.

40:26.343 --> 40:30.222
- He's lost all his body heat.
- If you keep him in there, you'll kill him.

40:30.305 --> 40:32.599
The cold is all that's keeping him alive.

40:32.683 --> 40:34.393
His heart stopped!

40:34.476 --> 40:38.480
- Give me one amp of epinephrine!
- You don't know what you're dealing with!

40:38.564 --> 40:43.068
He has been exposed to a retrovirus
resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome.

40:43.151 --> 40:46.655
- I want you out of my ER right now. Nurse!
- Yes. Ma'am...

40:46.738 --> 40:49.616
His blood has thickened.
That's why his heart is failing.

40:49.700 --> 40:52.828
His heart is failing
because he's lost all his body heat.

40:52.911 --> 40:57.708
No, the only thing saving him right now is
the hypometabolic state induced by the cold.

40:57.791 --> 41:01.753
Now, if you don't do what I'm saying,
you are going to kill him!

41:03.797 --> 41:06.258
Let's get him out of that tub now.

41:06.341 --> 41:07.551
Charged and ready.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.720
- Clear.
- Clear.

41:10.596 --> 41:12.598
- No rhythm.
- No.

41:12.681 --> 41:14.766
- Clear.
- Clear.

41:17.352 --> 41:19.563
- I'm picking up a faint pulse.
- Yes!

41:19.646 --> 41:21.899
I want a digoxin 0.1mg IV.

41:22.191 --> 41:27.070
Hang a heparin drip of 1,000 units per hour
and get two units of fresh frozen plasma now.

41:27.154 --> 41:30.449
- This patient's not even...
- He's going to make it.

41:38.624 --> 41:42.252
Transfusions and an aggressive treatment
with antiviral agents...

41:42.336 --> 41:47.674
...have resulted in a steady but gradual
improvement in Agent Mulder's condition.

41:47.758 --> 41:52.596
Blood tests have confirmed his exposure
to the still unidentified retrovirus...

41:52.679 --> 41:55.349
...whose origin remains a mystery.

41:56.558 --> 42:00.395
The search team that found Agent Mulder
located neither the submarine...

42:00.479 --> 42:02.981
...nor the man he was looking for.

42:03.065 --> 42:06.235
Several aspects of this case
remain unexplained...

42:06.318 --> 42:10.656
...suggesting the possibility
of paranormal phenomena.

42:10.739 --> 42:14.243
But I am convinced that
to accept such conclusions...

42:14.326 --> 42:19.373
...is to abandon all hope of understanding
the scientific events behind them.

42:20.165 --> 42:25.921
Many of the things I've seen have challenged
my faith and my belief in an ordered universe.

42:26.004 --> 42:29.508
But this uncertainty has only
strengthened my need to know...

42:29.591 --> 42:34.221
...to understand, to apply reason
to those things which seem to defy it.

42:36.014 --> 42:40.769
It was science that isolated the retrovirus
Agent Mulder was exposed to.

42:41.687 --> 42:45.858
And science that allowed us to
understand its behaviour.

42:46.441 --> 42:51.446
And ultimately... it was science
that saved Agent Mulder's life.

43:14.595 --> 43:16.680
Hey!

43:19.558 --> 43:21.643
How you feelin'?

43:28.859 --> 43:32.237
Like I got a bad case of freezer burn.

43:36.450 --> 43:38.535
How did I get here?

43:39.703 --> 43:42.414
A naval reconnaissance squad found you.

43:42.497 --> 43:45.125
They choppered you to Eisenhower Field.

43:47.669 --> 43:50.964
- Thanks for ditching me.
- I am sorry.

43:53.342 --> 43:56.428
I couldn't let you risk your life on this.

44:03.018 --> 44:05.938
Did you find what you were looking for?

44:09.650 --> 44:11.527
No...

44:12.069 --> 44:14.154
No.

44:15.364 --> 44:18.450
But I found something I thought I'd lost.

44:25.541 --> 44:27.668
Faith to keep looking.

44:38.387 --> 44:42.140
