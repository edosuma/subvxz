00:06.941 --> 00:09.208
Hey, Liv.
Hey, check you out.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.110
-My girlfriend's a super hero.
-Hey.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.312
Skyvolt!

00:13.314 --> 00:14.980
Thank goodness you're here.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.316
An evil lurks
in the cafeteria.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.251
Liver nuggets!

00:21.355 --> 00:23.222
Okay, well, sorry, Aubrey.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.791
I'm not exactly in
super hero mode right now.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.993
I actually just popped over
from set to pick up my homework.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.328
But, I mean, let's be honest.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.929
A cape really helps you
make an entrance.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.400
Also helps you make an exit.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.072
Skyvolt,

00:40.074 --> 00:43.308
an evil lurks in the cafeteria
only you can fight.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.210
Yeah, heard.
It's them liver nuggets.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.645
(laughs)

00:46.647 --> 00:48.213
Liv, honey,
thank goodness you're here--

00:48.215 --> 00:50.549
I cannot do anything
about these liver nuggets!

00:50.551 --> 00:52.518
Okay.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.554
The music program's budget
is being cut in half.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.356
-What?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.490
No!

00:58.492 --> 01:00.259
You have to save music,
Mrs. Rooney.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.693
Well, I am working on it.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.596
I am planning fund raisers.
I'm even gonna have a concert.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.366
A local sponsor will match
every dollar that we raise.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.835
Wow. Who's playing
at the concert?

01:09.837 --> 01:12.938
Well, I was hoping that
The Dream could play.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.207
Now, I know the band broke up

01:15.209 --> 01:16.408
when Andie and Holden broke up.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.411
Which maybe I shouldn't have
even mentioned.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.414
It's cool. I'm with
Dump Truck now.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.250
-And I'm with Liv.
-And I'm with Joey...

01:25.252 --> 01:27.352
whether he
acknowledges it or not.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.756
I mean...

01:30.758 --> 01:32.591
guys, what do you say?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.393
Do you wanna get
The Dream back together?

01:34.395 --> 01:36.228
-Yes!
-Let's do it!

01:36.230 --> 01:39.398
Great! So, it's
this Saturday night.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.367
-Oh, no. Saturday?
-Yeah.

01:42.369 --> 01:45.270
You guys, I can't. I'm--
I'm so sorry.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.072
I'm shooting <i> Voltage</i>
all weekend.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.474
Skyvolt!

01:49.443 --> 01:51.376
The liver nuggets
have mutated.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.779
We need you now
more than ever.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.282
What the heck.

a minute to talk?

02:56.544 --> 03:00.012
So, I just got a letter
from Notre Dame,

03:00.014 --> 03:02.381
and they offered me
a basketball scholarship.

03:02.383 --> 03:06.385
So, that makes five schools now
that have made me offers.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.987
-Five? Can you... just...
give me a second.
-Yeah. Yeah.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.790
<i>♪ My baby's going</i>

03:11.792 --> 03:13.659

Wooh!

03:18.699 --> 03:20.365
So, that's exciting news.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.167
(snorts) Ah.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.670
Yeah, and it's exciting to have
so many schools

03:24.672 --> 03:26.838
interested in me. Um...

03:26.840 --> 03:28.473
I don't know.
I just need your help choosing.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.475
Well, what are you thinking?

03:30.477 --> 03:32.811
I've just always
had my heart set on

03:32.813 --> 03:34.813
Southern California
State University,

03:34.815 --> 03:36.248
and none of these schools
are giving me

03:36.250 --> 03:37.749
that same feeling
of excitement.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.551
Honey, I know that
you're disappointed

03:39.553 --> 03:42.020
that SCSU didn't offer you
a scholarship, but you--

03:42.022 --> 03:43.922
you still have
some great choices.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.023
Yeah.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.025
So let Mama help you decide

03:47.027 --> 03:49.194
by taking you...

03:49.196 --> 03:51.263
on a little trip...

03:51.265 --> 03:52.998
to the future.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.103
So, in this
therapeutic role-play,

03:58.105 --> 04:01.506
I will be future you
after you've chosen a school.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.909
(clears throat)

04:09.550 --> 04:10.515
'Sup?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.419
Pick a school, son.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.689
Okay. Uh.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.424
Maybe let's try UConn.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.931
'Sup?

04:27.134 --> 04:31.036
So, like, I totally
went to UConn.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.772
And, uh, after retiring
from pro ball...
(snorts, laughs)

04:33.774 --> 04:36.642
I stopped visiting
my mom in Wisconsin,

04:36.644 --> 04:38.143
and she died alone.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.279
-A-bam! What?
-Mom.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.448
Mom, I don't say, "Bam. What?"
after everything.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.184
But in the future, you do.
It's a problem.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.228
Help fund the music department
by competing in

04:56.230 --> 04:59.798
Paws On A Porcupine!

04:59.800 --> 05:03.068
The student who keeps his paw
on Paulie the longest

05:03.070 --> 05:05.637
wins this... mystery prize.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.639
Oooh.

05:09.009 --> 05:13.245
This competition is generously
sponsored by Beef McGravy's.

05:13.247 --> 05:17.683
"It's the place to go
when you want beef and gr--
and gravy."

05:17.685 --> 05:19.584
Sounds dumb.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.919
Won't catch me doing that.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.587
Okay, but I guess you won't win

05:22.589 --> 05:24.589
the Geohawk Hands-Free
Electric Skateboard.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.697
Did you just say Geohawk
Hands-Free Electric Skateboard?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.001
Mom had this bad boy
delivered to the house.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.536
She hid it in the hamper...

05:38.672 --> 05:41.306
where I happened to
already be hiding.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.774
I have to put it back now.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.680
It's gotta be
the mystery prize.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.282
Okay, okay! Then let's do it!

05:50.284 --> 05:51.650
'Cause if one of us wins

05:51.652 --> 05:53.618
the Geohawk Hands-Free
Electric Skateboard,

05:53.620 --> 05:56.188
we both win the Geohawk
Hands-Free Electric Skateboard.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.689
Correction.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.859
It will be I who wins

06:00.861 --> 06:03.695
the Geohawk Hands-Free
Electric Skateboard. (laughs)

06:03.697 --> 06:05.530
Eavesdropping-
pays-off-again burn.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.902
All right, contestants,

06:10.904 --> 06:14.973
if your paw leaves Paulie,
you're out.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.342
Last competitor standing wins.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.744
Paws up...

06:20.047 --> 06:21.279
and go!

06:22.516 --> 06:25.684
The Rooney brothers
will destroy you, Artie.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.985
It's nothing personal.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.654
It's just that we despise you.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.793
Your rage empowers me.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.930
Nothing can distract me now.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.566
-Hey, guys!
-Except her.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.402
(whistle blows)
You're out.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.272
Bless you, Taylor.

06:47.274 --> 06:50.509
You're one self-sacrifice
closer to minion of the month.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.713
Um, okay. So has
anybody seen Willow?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.715
Because they changed
my <i> Voltage </i> schedule,

06:56.717 --> 06:58.183
and now I can do the concert!

06:58.185 --> 06:59.751
Yeah, I think I saw her
in the gym.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.786
Thank you,

07:00.788 --> 07:02.687
and, boys, good luck
with the contest.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.523
Perhaps a kiss
for luck, milady?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.595
I mean...
yeah, why not?

07:16.403 --> 07:19.638
You can kiss
minion of the month goodbye.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.607

08:07.254 --> 08:08.653

looking for somebody

08:08.655 --> 08:09.788
to sing with us on Saturday

08:09.790 --> 08:11.256
because you said
that you couldn't.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.858
Yeah, and if we
couldn't find anyone

08:12.860 --> 08:15.360
we figured we wouldn't have
to bring it up at all.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.699

You're right, Liv.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.268
We should have told you

08:52.699 --> 08:55.000
It's how my brothers and I
apologize to each other.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.603
The stupider you look,
the more sorry you are.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.744

Holden, you know
you're not supposed to
keep secrets from me.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.984
I mean, it wasn't a secret,
per se.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.288
Right? It was more of a...
delay of information.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.658
Yeah, like how you didn't tell
Andie right away

09:19.660 --> 09:21.726
that Holden broke up with her
because he was really into you.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.765
What?

09:26.767 --> 09:30.068
Unless you never
told Andie that,
in which case,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.703
One, two, three, four,

09:31.705 --> 09:33.738

09:33.740 --> 09:35.040
Willow, Willow,
Willow, Willow, stop.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.776
-Andie, just let me explain.
-It's pretty clear.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.377
Holden dumped me
for my friend,

09:39.379 --> 09:41.212
who didn't have the decency
to tell me about it.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.816
No, Andie. That's not-- Andie!

09:47.888 --> 09:49.087
I feel horrible.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.225
Now's probably
not the right time,

09:54.227 --> 09:57.529
but I just wanted to say
that I can play bass, too.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.634
Just... putting it out there.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.275
We're into hour six

10:10.277 --> 10:14.479
of Paws On A Porcupine
sponsored by Beef McGravy's.

10:14.481 --> 10:17.782
"Come for the beef,
stay for the gravy."

10:18.952 --> 10:21.219
It's time to thin the herd.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.687
Taylor, onion.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.058
(exhales)

10:27.060 --> 10:28.760
(crowd groans)

10:28.762 --> 10:29.928
(whistle blows)

10:29.930 --> 10:31.496
You two are out!

10:32.799 --> 10:34.733
Bleh.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.268
Artie, using onion breath

10:37.270 --> 10:39.404
to eliminate a competitor.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.772
That's devious.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.407
It's Newton's Third Law.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.743
For every action,
there's an equal reaction.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.079
Uh, an equal
and opposite reaction.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.081
Hush while the grownups
are talking, child.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.351
Newton said no such thing.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.620
Are you kidding me? Watch.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.790
Action, opposite reaction.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.026
(whistle blows) You're out!

11:01.028 --> 11:03.128
What? No!

11:03.130 --> 11:06.031
Thanks for
the science lesson, younglin'.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.206
Hey, Mom. Is Dad here yet?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.841
Oh, no, but you know who is?

11:16.843 --> 11:20.011
Future Maddie
as a Syracuse Orange.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.949
'Sup?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.352
Mom, you're not gonna
die alone.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.020
Joey is never leaving.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.189
(exhales)

11:32.559 --> 11:34.325
I know.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.728
Dad's home!

11:36.730 --> 11:38.163
Welcome home, sweetheart.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.899
Dad! I am so happy to see you.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.669
And I am glad to see you,
because...

11:44.671 --> 11:47.405
as the head coach of the
University of Wisconsin Beloit,

11:47.407 --> 11:52.043
it is my pleasure to offer you
a basketball scholarship.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.913
(gasp) What? Dad!

11:55.916 --> 11:57.882
Oh, this is so great!

11:57.884 --> 11:59.884
How'd you like to play
for your dad again?

11:59.886 --> 12:02.053
Now, now. She doesn't have to
decide right now.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.923
She has five other offers,
and this is a big decision.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.758
Right, yeah. Um.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.093
Yeah, actually, Dad,
I've been having a

12:08.095 --> 12:09.661
really hard time choosing.

12:09.663 --> 12:10.929
Do you think that
maybe we could...

12:10.931 --> 12:13.431
talk about what school
might be best for me?

12:13.433 --> 12:17.035
Oh. I can't talk to you
about other schools.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.536
It would be
a conflict of interest.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.973
-But, you know, maybe you should
talk to your mom about it.
-(gasp)

12:23.410 --> 12:25.577
I'll need a Beloit hat for this!

12:31.952 --> 12:34.519
We have got to
talk to Andie.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.387
I mean, she thinks that
we're horrible people.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.789
Are we horrible people?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.724
-No, we--
-I always thought we were
the good guys,

12:39.726 --> 12:42.794
but that is probably
exactly what the bad guys think.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.129
-You know, we're not--
-Oh!

12:44.965 --> 12:46.431
I'm a super villain.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.433
Okay.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.934
Holden, breath.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.136
I mean,

12:51.138 --> 12:53.605
you know, Willow said that
Andie calmed down, right?

12:53.607 --> 12:54.873
(grunts)

12:56.576 --> 12:58.443
-Let me go!
-(grunts)

12:58.445 --> 13:00.311
Willow, what--
did you kidnap her?

13:00.313 --> 13:03.114
Who cares? She's here now.
Let's talk.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.149
Wha--

13:04.151 --> 13:05.750
I'm out of here.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.453
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait,
just let me explain.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.955
Fine. Make it quick.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.991
Okay.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.560
I liked Holden...

13:15.562 --> 13:18.663
but I backed off
when you asked him to prom.

13:18.665 --> 13:22.734
And yes, he did break up
with you because he liked me,

13:22.736 --> 13:25.470
but I told him I wasn't gonna
go out with him, repeatedly.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.138
That's what happened.
I was there.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.206
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.343
Andie, I would never
betray your friendship.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.679
The only reason that we're
finally going out

13:34.681 --> 13:36.181
is because you suggested it.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.582
But you should have told me.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.852
I know. I know
I should have told you,

13:40.854 --> 13:42.854
but you were hurting
and I just thought that

13:42.856 --> 13:45.356
this would have made it
so much worse.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.992
-And if it helps at all--
-It does not.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.060
-Shh.
-Okay.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.097
I am so sorry, Andie.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.333
I should have told you sooner.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.203
Your friendship means
so much to me.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.873
I appreciate your honesty.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.975
I just don't know how
I'm gonna get over all this.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.044
No, totally. I get it.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.746
I mean, I was a real...
jerk-face.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.184
<i>♪ I'm a jerk-face,</i>
<i>I was wrong ♪</i>

14:13.186 --> 14:15.453
<i>♪ I dance for you,</i>
<i>I sing this song ♪</i>

14:15.455 --> 14:17.689
<i>♪ Jerk-face, jerk-face ♪</i>
(squealing)

14:17.691 --> 14:19.457
<i>♪ Jerk-face ♪</i>

14:19.459 --> 14:21.125
(gasps)

14:22.662 --> 14:25.230
Second verse,
same as the first

14:25.232 --> 14:27.465
but Holden style,
much much worse.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.968
<i>♪ I'm a jerk-face,</i>
<i>I was wrong ♪</i>

14:29.970 --> 14:31.803
<i>♪ I dance for you</i>
<i>and sing this song ♪</i>

14:31.805 --> 14:33.905
<i>♪ Jerk-face, ah!</i>
<i>Jerk-face, ah! ♪</i>

14:33.907 --> 14:34.973
<i>♪ Jerk-face ♪</i>

14:34.975 --> 14:36.441
<i>♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

14:39.145 --> 14:41.246
(chuckles) Wow.

14:41.248 --> 14:45.149
(laughs) That was the
stupidest thing I've ever seen.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.721
You guys must be
really sorry.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.222
Are we good?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.725
-We're good.
-(sighs)

14:53.727 --> 14:56.361
-(laughs)
-Yes! The Dream lives!

14:56.363 --> 14:58.096
Let's go rehearse.

14:58.098 --> 15:02.267
-Hold on! A certain kidnapper
owes me a jerk-face dance.
-(gasps)

15:02.269 --> 15:05.103
(laughs)

15:05.105 --> 15:07.272
Willow doesn't jerk-face.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.274
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.142
-Here we go.
-Yeah.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.252
Hey.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.122
Aren't you supposed to be at
the Paws On A Porcupine thing?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.524
Yeah. I just stopped by
to get snacks.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.459
I think Joey might win.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.895
Wow. (chuckles)

15:30.897 --> 15:33.131
That's a sentence
I have never heard before.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.165
Right?

15:36.870 --> 15:39.604
So, uh, what's with the hats?

15:39.606 --> 15:42.373
These are the hats
of the places

15:42.375 --> 15:45.076
that have offered me
scholarships.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.478
Yeah. I'm just--
I'm sort of struggling with
which one to pick.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.515
Well, you'd look good
in the orange one.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.120
Thank you, but that's
not what this is about.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.288
Um.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.390
I just-- I'm having a hard time
picking a school,

15:59.392 --> 16:02.493
and Dad has made it
infinitely more complicated

16:02.495 --> 16:04.929
by offering me
the scholarship to Beloit.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.332
Well, how does that
make it more complicated?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.267
I don't know.
'Cause playing for Dad

16:09.269 --> 16:11.135
sounds like
it would be super fun.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.338
I've just-- I haven't been
excited about playing anywhere

16:13.340 --> 16:14.505
other than SCSU.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.275
Great, so tell Dad
that you'll play for Beloit.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.277
No. It's not great.

16:19.279 --> 16:23.181
This is the biggest
decision that I've ever
had to make, and...

16:23.183 --> 16:25.750
what if I'm just letting
my heart talk and not my head?

16:25.752 --> 16:29.253
Yeah. You're confusing me.

16:30.857 --> 16:34.125
Uh, this, uh
touchy-feely stuff

16:34.127 --> 16:37.128
is too touchy
and too feely, so...

16:37.130 --> 16:38.162
see ya.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.270
Parker,

16:46.272 --> 16:47.972
not sure how much more
of this I can take.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.108
We're 18 hours in,
and there's no end in sight.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.479
Ref, is slapping a contestant
against the rules?

16:54.481 --> 16:55.680
I don't think so.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.122
Thank you.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.225
Minions,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.193
slap me.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.629
(whistle blows) You're out!

17:13.333 --> 17:15.266
I can't even look
at the two of you.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.369
Artie,

17:18.371 --> 17:21.406
I'm so tired right now.
I can't even despise you.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.075
Let's make a deal.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.910
I'm listening...

17:25.912 --> 17:28.012
sort of. I'm delirious.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.548
We'll share custody of the

17:30.550 --> 17:32.517
Geohawk Free-Hands
Electric Skateboard.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.018
Deal.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.320
(laughs) Fine,

17:36.322 --> 17:38.089
and seal it with
a promissory oath.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.257
Parker, will you
administer, please.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.993
Artie, repeat after me.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.728
I, Artie Smalls...

17:43.730 --> 17:45.596
I, Artie Smalls...

17:45.598 --> 17:48.166
have just taken
my hand off Paulie.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.401
have just taken
my hand off Paulie. (gasps)

17:50.403 --> 17:52.370
(whistle blows)
You're out!

17:52.372 --> 17:55.373
-(laughs)
-(cries) No!

17:55.375 --> 17:57.975
Both: Rooney-brothers-
beat-you burn.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.345
We have a winner!

18:01.347 --> 18:04.182
Oh, please.
Thank you so much.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.349
Thank you.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.518
Congratulations, Joey.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.353
You have just won--

18:09.355 --> 18:12.890
Both: The Geohawk Hands-Free
Electric Skateboard!

18:12.892 --> 18:14.859
What? No, that's not the prize.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.027
What?

18:16.029 --> 18:17.428
Well, why else would you have

18:17.430 --> 18:19.397
a Geohawk Hands-Free
Electric Skateboard?

18:19.399 --> 18:23.167
To show all the kids that
I'm down with their sick rides.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.637
So, what is the prize?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.439
Oh. (chuckles)

18:28.441 --> 18:30.274
Oop. (chuckles)

18:30.276 --> 18:32.043
It is a certificate

18:32.045 --> 18:33.611
for a college counseling lunch

18:33.613 --> 18:36.380
with Vice Principal Rooney
at Beef McGravy's.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.419
"Where you major in beef
and minor in gravy."

18:41.421 --> 18:44.155
Both: No!

18:50.230 --> 18:51.362
Hey, Dad.

18:52.398 --> 18:55.500
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's not about...

18:55.502 --> 18:57.602
college or basketball
or anything. It's--

18:57.604 --> 19:00.004
Actually, it's about, um...

19:01.241 --> 19:02.673
a cow.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.245
Nothing in the rules against
talking about a cow.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.816
Right, so--
so there's this cow.

19:11.818 --> 19:16.087
Uh, and she's trying
to choose a...

19:16.089 --> 19:17.355
meadow.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.791
Um, and-- and, you know,
there are a lot of really...

19:20.793 --> 19:25.129
great meadows,
but there's only one that's
making her feel... excited.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.533
Okay, so--
so what's this cow...

19:28.535 --> 19:31.135
like about this particular...

19:31.137 --> 19:32.403
meadow?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.541
Well, there's this
farmer there

19:36.543 --> 19:39.343
who taught her how to eat grass
when she was a calf.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.647
Um...

19:42.649 --> 19:43.881
and...

19:43.883 --> 19:47.285
the problem is, she just--
she can't tell if...

19:47.287 --> 19:49.787
she likes the meadow
because she loves her farmer...

19:52.325 --> 19:54.725
or, you know, because it's
the right meadow for her.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.897
Well, you should tell your...

19:59.899 --> 20:01.532
cow...

20:02.468 --> 20:05.803
as long as you give
each meadow

20:05.805 --> 20:08.573
serious consideration...

20:08.575 --> 20:13.244
the emotional choice can still
be the right choice.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.981
Yeah. Got it.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.817
Also...

20:22.188 --> 20:24.021
tell that cow...

20:24.023 --> 20:25.489
no matter what,

20:25.491 --> 20:27.558
the farmer's always
gonna love her...

20:29.195 --> 20:32.129
and support
whatever decision she makes.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.833
Thanks, Dad.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.577
I'm choosing Beloit.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.913
I wanna play
basketball for you.

20:48.915 --> 20:53.284
Yes! Yes!

20:53.286 --> 20:55.253
I thought that's what
we were talking about,

20:55.255 --> 20:56.487
but I wasn't sure!

20:57.423 --> 21:00.091
-(grunts)
-Yeah!

21:00.093 --> 21:02.293
(laughs) Oh.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.461
'Sup?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.263
(laughs)

21:05.265 --> 21:08.633
-I'm going to Beloit!
-Yeah!

21:10.403 --> 21:12.436
I am proud to say,

21:12.438 --> 21:14.805
the music program
has been saved!

21:14.807 --> 21:17.508
(cheering)

21:19.612 --> 21:22.546
Thanks to our generous sponsor,
Beef McGravy's,

21:22.548 --> 21:24.915
"where the beef is boffo,
and the gravy--"

21:24.917 --> 21:26.317
You know what?
We reached our goal.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.486
I am not doing this.
(chuckles) Okay.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.656
Put your hands together for...
The Dream.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.725

Oh, Joey,

23:01.914 --> 23:03.748
we need to schedule our lunch.

23:03.750 --> 23:07.084
Mom, why aren't you on your
Geohawk Hands-Free
Electric Skateboard

23:07.086 --> 23:08.686
instead of using
your stupid feet?

23:08.688 --> 23:10.654
No, no.

23:10.656 --> 23:13.057
I nearly broke my neck
trying to ride that thing.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.158
I sold it online.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.897
Hello, Rooneys.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.332
(laughs)

23:21.334 --> 23:23.401
Have fun using
your stupid feet.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.869
(chuckles)

23:24.871 --> 23:27.138
Minions, we glide.
