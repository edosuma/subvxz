00:21.597 --> 00:24.172
The first ever
Wagstaff Volunteer Day

00:24.191 --> 00:25.691
is about to begin.

00:25.842 --> 00:27.267
I just gave this
little speech to the sidewalk

00:27.361 --> 00:29.753
gum-scrapers,
but I'll say it again here.

00:29.846 --> 00:31.588
Yes, all of this was my idea.

00:31.607 --> 00:34.107
One day I drove past
a busload of prisoners

00:34.260 --> 00:35.926
picking up trash and I thought,

00:35.944 --> 00:38.095
"What about that,
but for schoolchildren?"

00:38.188 --> 00:43.116
And Wagstaff Mandatory
Volunteer Day was born.

00:43.269 --> 00:45.619
Wow, I'm glad you didn't
drive by something way worse.

00:45.695 --> 00:46.937
Like a CrossFit.

00:46.955 --> 00:48.272
Everyone stay in line.

00:48.290 --> 00:50.049
I'll be right back,
I just have to go potty.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.367
Maybe I shouldn't
volunteer that info.

00:52.461 --> 00:54.628
Hmm? (chuckles)
All right, whatever.

00:54.780 --> 00:55.888
Beach clean-up, huh, guys?

00:56.039 --> 00:57.781
Did we pick the best activity
or what?

00:57.874 --> 00:59.224
Uh, yeah, duh.

00:59.376 --> 01:00.967
Do you think it'll be like
cleaning up at the restaurant?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.044
Because I am pretty good
at that.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.138
I mean, it's not more greasy
after you clean.

01:05.291 --> 01:07.048
Sucks to be those kids.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.959
They waited too long
and now they have to shelve

01:08.977 --> 01:10.627
books at the public library.

01:10.646 --> 01:11.978
Ew.
Ew to books, ew to all of it.

01:12.131 --> 01:13.847
I mean, public library
could be cool.

01:13.999 --> 01:16.057
Yeah, the library has magazines.

01:16.151 --> 01:18.077
Maybe we should've picked
the library, Zeke.

01:18.304 --> 01:20.245
-Nah, J-Ju.
-I'm second-guessing.

01:20.397 --> 01:22.306

Meet Tina.
We're gonna get along just fine.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.143
No, no, no, no, no.

03:57.296 --> 03:59.963
Okay, listen up,
you will sort all trash

03:59.982 --> 04:02.223
into recyclables,
non-recyclables,

04:02.392 --> 04:04.634
and a third category
we'll call "unspeakables."

04:04.728 --> 04:07.471
Which brings me to gloves.
Trust me: wear the gloves.

04:07.473 --> 04:09.139
Gimme, gimme, gimme!
These make it seem

04:09.157 --> 04:10.082

04:10.309 --> 04:11.808
You<i> are</i> doing this.

04:11.827 --> 04:13.477
-Right.
-Okay, get to it.

04:13.570 --> 04:16.255
If you need me, I'll be
over there, watching like a hawk

04:16.482 --> 04:18.498
but also making a quick call
to the cable company.

04:18.650 --> 04:20.926
I'm somehow being charged
for three cable boxes.

04:21.153 --> 04:23.077

No?

04:23.097 --> 04:25.171

-(all clamoring)

04:25.324 --> 04:27.173
It's a filthy cold
garbage beach.

04:27.326 --> 04:29.175
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.103
I was gonna high-five a pelican.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.512
More fishing line undies.

04:32.664 --> 04:35.165
What's with these fish losing
their underwear?

04:35.183 --> 04:37.109
What the heck was I thinking?

04:37.278 --> 04:40.612
I live here. I forgot
how horrible our town is. Blech.

04:40.764 --> 04:43.115
Are you sure you're not
just excited about how fun

04:43.342 --> 04:44.508
and difficult this is gonna be?

04:44.526 --> 04:46.192
Oh, hey, look, a hermit crab.
Fun already.

04:46.345 --> 04:48.269
Cool crab fact:
they're not actually hermits.

04:48.363 --> 04:49.863
-They're pretty social.
-This is no time

04:50.032 --> 04:52.032
for your aquarium mumbo jumbo,
Tina.

04:52.184 --> 04:54.200
Yeah, enough
of your crab-aganda.

04:54.353 --> 04:56.353
They also change their shells
when they outgrow them.

04:56.371 --> 04:58.038
Like me and shoes
every two months.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.781
I wish I could change shells.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.207
I'd change into the shell
of a kid who didn't have

05:01.302 --> 05:03.543
to clean this friggin' beach.

05:03.695 --> 05:04.786
Oh, shell yes.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.880
Question about my bill.

05:07.032 --> 05:09.141
Question. About. My bill.

05:09.368 --> 05:11.125
Am I not saying that clearly?

05:11.145 --> 05:12.960
I told you I don't have
any food.

05:13.038 --> 05:13.979
Looks like you made a friend,
Gene.

05:14.206 --> 05:15.705
I guess I drop a lot of food

05:15.724 --> 05:17.298
when I come to Wonder Wharf
and the gulls have noticed.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.376
I don't have anything right now.

05:19.469 --> 05:22.379
-Don't look at me like that.
-Ugh. Soda cups. Paper plates.

05:22.397 --> 05:25.139
-This is all stuff
from Wonder Wharf.
-JIMMY JR.: Look, Zeke.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.233
The wrapper
for a foot-long taco dog.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.235
Oh, man,
that's making me hungry.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.829
Comes with that chunky
cheese dippin' sauce.

05:31.056 --> 05:34.074
-Mmm, chunky.
-Give me the wrapper.
I want to smell it.

05:34.226 --> 05:35.909
And the seagull also
wants to smell it.

05:36.061 --> 05:37.394
I just put it in my trash bag.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.320
Ah, fine.
He's got nothing for us.

05:39.414 --> 05:41.340
-Hey, Mickey.
-Bunny Ears.

05:41.491 --> 05:43.324
Are you small
or are you just far away?

05:43.344 --> 05:45.993
Both. Hey, you still work
at the wharf, right?

05:46.088 --> 05:47.679
Yep, until my ship comes in.

05:47.831 --> 05:50.331
-I applied to work on a ship.
-Why aren't Wonder Wharf people

05:50.500 --> 05:53.243
picking up
all this Wonder Wharf trash?

05:53.261 --> 05:54.411
I don't know.
Ask Mr. Fischoeder.

05:54.429 --> 05:56.688
-He's right next to you.
-Ooh.

05:56.915 --> 05:57.856
Yes, he is. Hi.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.799
Please stop badgering
my employee.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.434
Carnies are delicate creatures.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.011
Interaction with
the outside world confuses them.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.197
Hi, Mr. Fischoeder.

06:05.348 --> 06:07.014
Hi, whichever one you are.

06:07.109 --> 06:08.867
You're late, I assume.
Go to work.

06:09.018 --> 06:10.202
Quick, but have fun.

06:10.429 --> 06:13.279
Ah, the lovely, stinky ocean.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.281
Just out
for my daily salt-stitutional.

06:15.358 --> 06:18.860
Salty sea air keeps me
well-preserved, like a ham hock.

06:18.954 --> 06:20.361
Mr. Fischoeder. Look at this.

06:20.455 --> 06:22.363
All this trash is
from Wonder Wharf.

06:22.457 --> 06:24.365
And now I have to pick it up
because school is

06:24.459 --> 06:26.385
making me
because they're monsters.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.945
Now, now, there's no way to know
where that trash comes from.

06:28.964 --> 06:30.113
It could be from anywhere.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.132
"From the desk
of Calvin Fischoeder."

06:32.284 --> 06:33.466
It's a very common name.

06:33.619 --> 06:34.968
How do I know it's not
from your desk?

06:35.120 --> 06:36.302
Maybe you're Calvin Fischoeder.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.471
Anyway, thanks
for all the free child labor.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.473
It's the best kind of labor,
after all.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.642
You're not welcome.
I mean, shouldn't you be

06:42.794 --> 06:43.810
paying to clean this up?

06:43.962 --> 06:45.311
Some would say so,
but people keep

06:45.464 --> 06:46.905
volunteering to do it for me.

06:47.132 --> 06:49.741
School groups, do-gooders.
You know, squares.

06:49.893 --> 06:52.059
Now excuse me, I have to de-salt

06:52.079 --> 06:54.413
before I attend
to my wharf duties.

06:54.564 --> 06:57.140
Mmm. Yes, I might have
overdone it today.

06:57.233 --> 07:00.067
Hmm, wait. If volunteers like us

07:00.087 --> 07:02.570
didn't clean the beach,
then nobody would?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.998
And everyone would blame you
and be mad?

07:05.150 --> 07:06.816
I don't like
where this is going.

07:06.910 --> 07:09.819
I think what I need is some
motivation, like, I don't know,

07:09.838 --> 07:11.988
a free foot-long taco dog?

07:11.990 --> 07:14.081
Now, if I gave you an FLTD,

07:14.101 --> 07:15.992
I'd have to give one
to everyone.

07:16.085 --> 07:18.344
Well... yeah.
So, how 'bout it?

07:18.497 --> 07:20.588
(groans) You're a pesky
garbage urchin, aren't you?

07:20.682 --> 07:21.831
Does that mean yes?

07:21.850 --> 07:24.443
Whoa-ho, volunteering
<i> is</i> rewarding.

07:28.507 --> 07:29.948
Okay, Jocelyn,
and make a face like,

07:30.099 --> 07:31.766
"Oh, my God,
I'm doing a good thing

07:31.785 --> 07:32.951
and I don't even care who sees."

07:33.102 --> 07:34.527
-Got it.
-Great.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.104
Um, you kind of just dropped
that trash back on the beach

07:37.199 --> 07:38.698
after you took your picture--
maybe you want

07:38.792 --> 07:41.868
-to just pop that in your bag?
-Don't be a bag nag, Tina.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.778
Yeah. My bag's clean.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.112
I don't want to get trash on it.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.856
Everyone. Attention?

07:46.950 --> 07:50.043
I just wanted to let you know
that I convinced Mr. Fischoeder

07:50.195 --> 07:52.212
to give us
free foot-long taco dogs

07:52.364 --> 07:54.806
-if we clean the beach.
-(kids cheering)

07:54.958 --> 07:56.123
Um, is that all?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.976
What do you mean, "is that all?"

07:58.127 --> 08:00.370
It's free foot-long
taco dogs, Tammy,

08:00.463 --> 08:03.223
that you were not getting
before, but now you are.

08:03.375 --> 08:06.042
I mean, cleaning a whole beach
for some hot dogs?

08:06.135 --> 08:08.044
It's a foot-long taco dog!

08:08.137 --> 08:09.637
Don't call it a hot dog.

08:09.731 --> 08:10.972
Show some respect.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.216
I'm telling her that.
I know<i> you</i> know.

08:13.235 --> 08:15.401
Tammy's right-- it is a lot
of work for just that.

08:15.496 --> 08:18.071
I mean, we're supposed
to clean the beach anyway.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.981
Yeah, but not for nothing.

08:20.075 --> 08:21.891
That's what volunteering is.

08:21.985 --> 08:23.226
Um, don't think so.

08:23.245 --> 08:24.836
Okay, I'll be the negotiator.

08:24.988 --> 08:26.338
Ugh! It's easy, you just say

08:26.565 --> 08:28.340
"no, better, no, better"
until you have

08:28.567 --> 08:30.083
the biggest bedroom
in the house.

08:30.235 --> 08:32.068
What? No. I can handle it.

08:32.161 --> 08:34.179
That was just...
round one, people.

08:34.406 --> 08:36.163
Of course we're gonna go bigger.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.498
I'll, uh, go back
for round two right now.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.518
Wait, Louise, maybe
we should use this time

08:39.594 --> 08:41.761
to actually, I don't know,
clean up the beach?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.188
And what about Mr. Frond?

08:43.415 --> 08:45.582
I do not want the Sports
and Extreme Outdoors Package.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.176
I just want to watch
premium dramas on one cable box

08:49.196 --> 08:51.345
and pay for just
the one cable box, Derek!

08:51.365 --> 08:53.773
Okay, he's a little distracted.

08:53.942 --> 08:55.608
Tina, this is good
for the beach.

08:55.761 --> 08:57.018
Because we get stuff.

08:57.186 --> 08:59.037
The beach is happy
when we're happy.

08:59.188 --> 09:01.281
-What?
-You get it.
Okay, see you later.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.100
Mm, you've still got it, Bob.
Haven't lost a step.

09:04.119 --> 09:06.360
You mean in the two weeks
you were weirdly

09:06.529 --> 09:08.938
not coming here because you
were growing a mustache?

09:09.032 --> 09:10.106
-Mmm. Yeah.
-What's that?

09:10.125 --> 09:12.199
-It's my grooming kit.
-Looks fancy.

09:12.294 --> 09:14.110
The guy at the shaving store
sold it to me.

09:14.203 --> 09:16.888
Just the basics-- clippers,
oils, combs, shampoos.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.131
My 'Stache Cash card.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.300
That's their
Mustache Rewards program.

09:20.452 --> 09:21.893
How much did you pay
for all that?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.286
-75 bucks.
-Wow.

09:23.379 --> 09:25.638
-You don't use this stuff, Bob?
-Uh, no.

09:25.715 --> 09:27.399
Okay, walk me
through your mustache regimen.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.960
I guess I get food out of it
when there's food in it?

09:31.129 --> 09:33.129
-And...?
-I think that's about it.

09:33.148 --> 09:35.222
Oof. Well, now we're
in this together, pal.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.391
Pretty soon, we'll be
trading mustache advice,

09:37.411 --> 09:39.911
keeping a mustache log
that we only show each other.

09:40.138 --> 09:41.971
-Mm, mm-hmm.
-Better go floss this thing.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.139
You floss yours?

09:43.158 --> 09:44.899
-You want to join?
-I'm-I'm good.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.810
Uh, you're not, but okay.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.661
Huh. Felix, too?

09:48.814 --> 09:50.738
She's gonna be here this
afternoon to take pictures.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.924
Do you really think she can
make this junky old wharf

09:53.001 --> 09:54.651
look like
a hot tourist attraction?

09:54.669 --> 09:57.003
Sonya's the best
at photographing the worst.

09:57.155 --> 09:59.097
She could make Chernobyl
look like Cher-yes-byl.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.341
It won't be easy,
especially this time of year.

10:01.493 --> 10:03.176
Sonya said this time of year's
better actually?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.844
Fewer people on the wharf.

10:04.996 --> 10:06.996
Yes, people can be an eyesore.

10:07.165 --> 10:08.681
-Not you. You're fine.
-Don't worry.

10:08.834 --> 10:11.092
she's gonna give us something
great for the pamphlet.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.594
Ah, pamphlets to display
at hotels and airports--

10:13.614 --> 10:17.264
the lifeblood of any two-bit
circus and roadside attraction.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.008
Someday we'll have
a nice pamphlet.

10:19.102 --> 10:22.103
Maybe this is our year. Look,
we'll even have an actually sort

10:22.164 --> 10:23.938
-of clean beach.
-LOUISE: Well, well, well.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.850
-(both gasp)
-Sounds like you really
need the beach clean, huh?

10:26.868 --> 10:28.109
Is someone getting

10:28.128 --> 10:30.128
their amusement park picture
taken today?

10:30.355 --> 10:32.279
We are. We were literally
just talking about that.

10:32.448 --> 10:33.447
Felix, hush.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.375
We might be able
to spruce up that sand.

10:35.543 --> 10:37.877
But, uh, it's gonna take
more than foot-long taco dogs.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.471
But they're a foot long.

10:39.622 --> 10:40.788
I mean, we've tried to
get them longer than that,

10:40.807 --> 10:41.806
but it doesn't work.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.475
They sag. It's unsightly.

10:43.626 --> 10:47.312
I was thinking...
a free day at Wonder Wharf.

10:47.539 --> 10:49.648
For me and every kid
cleaning the beach.

10:49.799 --> 10:51.891
-Snack-inclusive.
-Fine.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.060
If you de-trashify the beach
thoroughly

10:54.212 --> 10:57.046
from dead sea creature
to sleeping guy,

10:57.065 --> 10:58.715
within your allotted
volunteer hours,

10:58.733 --> 11:01.217
I'll give you and your friends
a free day on the wharf.

11:01.310 --> 11:02.977
Yes, I guess that's manageable.

11:03.071 --> 11:04.570
Uh, and you shut
the place down for us.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.982
No lines, no waiting,
the full Willy Wonka.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.242
The full Willy Wonka?

11:09.394 --> 11:11.227
-Whoa.
-It's never been done.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.672
It goes against the whole idea
of making money with a business.

11:13.899 --> 11:16.733
Okay, forget it. Hope your
pictures turn out real pretty

11:16.751 --> 11:19.160
-with all that garbage
blowing around.
-(sighs)

11:19.328 --> 11:22.238
Very well, you win,
annoying burger child.

11:22.257 --> 11:24.832
-Wait, really? Yes!
-Seriously?

11:24.926 --> 11:26.576
Hmm, she does look
like a burger.

11:26.594 --> 11:28.928
Listen up!
I just got us the best prize

11:29.097 --> 11:30.747
of our sweet little lives.

11:30.765 --> 11:32.248
Uh, as my dad says to me

11:32.341 --> 11:34.267
whenever I ask to borrow
his angora sweater--

11:34.361 --> 11:35.342
yeah, right.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.937
Trust me,
you're gonna like this.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.439
Clean. Oh, yeah.
Clean. Clean. Clean.

11:39.591 --> 11:41.199
Free day on the wharf.
Free day on the wharf.

11:41.350 --> 11:43.443
Come on, Jocelyn.
Pick up the pace.

11:43.611 --> 11:46.262
Yeah, Jocelyn. I don't want
to see any slack in that sack.

11:46.355 --> 11:47.354
God!

11:47.523 --> 11:48.873
Don't just stand there
looking righteous.

11:49.025 --> 11:50.266
If you want to be my plus-one

11:50.359 --> 11:52.127
on the wharf,
you're gonna have to earn it.

11:56.199 --> 11:57.457
Wow, Louise. I think
we're actually gonna do it.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.609
The beach is
almost not covered in trash.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.961
Do you think it feels naked?
Should we toss a shirt on it?

12:02.113 --> 12:03.129
Well, you did it, Louise.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.723
We're getting
the full Willy Wonka.

12:04.874 --> 12:07.225
Wait, one of us gets to own
the park at the end of the day?

12:07.376 --> 12:09.452
No. Okay, it's
a three-quarter Wonka.

12:09.454 --> 12:11.804
-It's a Willy Wonk.
-Wait, is that Mickey?

12:11.898 --> 12:15.308
TINA:
Mr. Fischoeder makes him
boogie-board holding bags?

12:15.460 --> 12:16.717
Is that to entertain
the tourists?

12:16.737 --> 12:17.902
-I'm into it.
-Hmm.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.479
Keep cleaning, I'll be back.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.148
I'm gonna see what Mickey
Wetsuit over there is up to.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.984
Boy, Teddy's been in
the bathroom for a while, huh?

12:25.136 --> 12:26.986
He's been in and out of there,
like, five times.

12:27.138 --> 12:28.488
He's playing with his mustache.
I know it.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.140
Oh, Bob, so what?
He likes grooming it.

12:31.234 --> 12:32.917
You know, you could stand
to give your bushel

12:33.069 --> 12:35.036
-a brushing now and then.
-Hmm.

12:35.146 --> 12:36.162
Hey, Bob,
when you scratch your mustache,

12:36.314 --> 12:37.163
does your leg bounce?

12:37.332 --> 12:38.498
What is that, some kinda reflex?

12:38.592 --> 12:41.200
That doesn't happen to me...
or anybody.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.668
Hey, what do you do
with the hairs that fall

12:42.763 --> 12:45.505
out of your mustache? Do you put
'em in a little velvet sack?

12:45.657 --> 12:49.083
-Ooh!
-Okay, Teddy, let's have
a mustache talk time-out.

12:49.177 --> 12:50.584
Uh, okay,
but real quick, time in.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.012
-I-I called time out.
-Yeah, and I called time in.

12:53.164 --> 12:54.497
-We each get three.
-What?

12:54.516 --> 12:57.000
Hey, before I forget,
do you do anything special

12:57.018 --> 12:58.501
in the bathtub
to pamper your mustache?

12:58.594 --> 13:01.112
I have to go, um...
away from here.

13:01.264 --> 13:03.097
-Bye.
-So this is
your second time-out?

13:03.174 --> 13:04.765
Or we're on your first?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.859
Mickey. How's the surf? Up?

13:07.012 --> 13:08.435
Oh, hey.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.864
Yeah, just out here doing
some boarding, boogie-style.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.124
Aren't you supposed
to be working?

13:13.276 --> 13:14.292
Also what's with the bag?

13:14.519 --> 13:16.869
Oh, this?
It's all my boogie gear.

13:17.022 --> 13:19.038
-Looks like trash.
-Well, that's 'cause
you don't know

13:19.190 --> 13:20.690
much about the boogie lifestyle.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.026
Wait a minute--
did Mr. Fischoeder send you

13:23.044 --> 13:24.694
to trash the beach
at the last minute,

13:24.712 --> 13:27.213
so he wouldn't have to give us
the three-quarter Willy Wonka?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.382
-Uh...
-He did, didn't he, Mickey?

13:29.534 --> 13:31.476
-Didn't he?
-(groans) How'd you know?

13:31.627 --> 13:34.145
Was it the whole "darting away
when you saw me" thing?

13:34.372 --> 13:35.480
I knew that looked suspicious.

13:35.631 --> 13:37.540
I've always been terrible
at darting. You mad?

13:37.633 --> 13:40.151
Yeah, I'm mad.
What was the plan? Spill it.

13:40.228 --> 13:42.136
After the photographer
takes her pictures,

13:42.155 --> 13:43.822
I'm supposed to wait
for the signal,

13:43.973 --> 13:45.214
then spread trash on the beach.

13:45.233 --> 13:46.549
What's the signal?

13:46.642 --> 13:48.309
Felix is gonna shriek
like a scared peacock.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.144
It's the only
animal sound he knows.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.830
(groans)
So unfair!

13:51.981 --> 13:53.239
I know, poor guy.
I should teach him

13:53.391 --> 13:54.982
how to moo-- oh, or oink.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.951
Anyway, let's never lie
to each other again.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.153
But, uh, don't tell
anybody we talked, okay?

13:59.247 --> 14:01.247
-Bob. Bob.
-Yeah?

14:01.399 --> 14:03.157
Mind if I bring up
a ticklish subject?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.676
Your mustache. Get it?.

14:04.827 --> 14:06.069
'Cause it tickles? Eh...

14:06.162 --> 14:07.737
But, seriously,
I'm looking at you

14:07.830 --> 14:08.921
and I'm seeing a dry mustache.

14:09.090 --> 14:10.014
A real lip loofah.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.757
I can't do this anymore, Teddy.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.167
I can't talk about this anymore.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.336
-Bob...
-No, Linda, it's too much.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.747
This is too much. I-It's fine
that you have a mustache.

14:17.916 --> 14:19.932
But we have to talk
about other things, Teddy.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.342
There's a whole world out there.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.936
Oh, you know what I think
this is? You're jealous.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.013
Suddenly you're not
the only mustache guy.

14:26.107 --> 14:27.256
I'm not jealous!

14:27.350 --> 14:28.941
There's a hot new mustache
on the scene,

14:29.094 --> 14:30.276
and Bob can't stand it!

14:30.370 --> 14:32.095
Huh, Bob? You can't stand it!

14:32.188 --> 14:33.371
'Cause I got one of these now.

14:33.522 --> 14:35.448
-That's ridiculous, Teddy!
-Oh, is it?!

14:35.600 --> 14:38.710
Calm down, both of ya.
You're acting like babies.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.103
-Hairy babies.
-Fine.

14:40.121 --> 14:42.714
Bring me my bill
and I will be on my way.

14:42.941 --> 14:44.273
Aah! Tangle.

14:44.367 --> 14:47.944
So I had to touch garbage
and I got sand on my leg,

14:47.962 --> 14:49.703
and it was all for nothing?

14:49.797 --> 14:51.372
I got sand on my leg, too.

14:51.466 --> 14:53.207
At least tell me there
will be foot-long taco dogs!

14:53.226 --> 14:55.209
I promised the seagull.

14:55.303 --> 14:57.620
Look, I'm sorry.
It's stupid Fischoeder.

14:57.789 --> 15:00.640
But, hey, the beach is cleaner,
which is the whole reason

15:00.734 --> 15:02.642
we came here today, so yay?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.569
And it's not a big deal,
but I cleaned the most.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.237
Not that that makes me
a better person or anything.

15:06.464 --> 15:08.055
I wasn't even thinking
about that. (chuckles)

15:08.133 --> 15:09.315
ZEKE:
Hey, look at that.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.225
Poor little thing's
living out of a foot-long

15:11.244 --> 15:12.485
taco dog dippin' sauce cup.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.412
We never thought about
the dark side of the dog.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.489
He must've gotten confused
at shell-changing time.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.249
This beach is usually
so covered in garbage

15:18.401 --> 15:19.992
he doesn't know what's a shell
and what's not.

15:20.145 --> 15:23.087
This is most I've ever been
disappointed in dipping sauce.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.073
He's never gonna be able
to get a hermit crab job

15:26.167 --> 15:27.908
or a hermit crab date.
Not looking like that.

15:28.002 --> 15:29.835
See? This is why
we clean the beach.

15:29.988 --> 15:31.654
So this guy can find
his soul mate.

15:31.656 --> 15:32.746
Wait. That's it.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.081
What? We do<i> The Bachelor,</i>
but for crabs?

15:34.175 --> 15:35.600
And we make this right?

15:35.827 --> 15:36.750
Oh, my God, yes!

15:36.770 --> 15:38.327
No, this little guy's
gonna get us

15:38.346 --> 15:40.254
all the way to
the three-quarter Wonka.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.181
-Tammy, I need your phone.
-Hey!

15:42.275 --> 15:44.258
Do you want a three-quarter
Wonka day or not?

15:44.352 --> 15:46.444
-(groans)
-Hey, crab, say cheese.

15:46.671 --> 15:48.354
GENE: But not
"chunky cheese dipping sauce."

15:48.448 --> 15:50.281
Because you're probably
sensitive about that.

15:54.362 --> 15:55.936
Okay, little garbage crab,
you're our golden ticket.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.530
How do you find
a crab's best angle?

15:57.682 --> 15:58.605
(groans) Let me.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.940
(camera clicking)

16:00.034 --> 16:01.292
Mm, that one's cute,
use that one.

16:01.444 --> 16:03.444
But you're in the--
(groans) Good enough.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.689
Looks like Fischoeder's
special guest is here.

16:06.708 --> 16:07.857
I'll be right back.

16:07.950 --> 16:09.875
Here you go.
Hope you like food.

16:10.028 --> 16:11.285
Uh, thank you.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.120
Lin, did you just say,
"I hope you like food"?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.864
What? I try stuff out.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.790
-Oh, no.
-I'm shaving it!

16:16.810 --> 16:17.958
I'm shaving it off!

16:18.052 --> 16:19.310
Teddy, what are you
talking about?

16:19.462 --> 16:20.961
-I'm shaving off the mustache.
-(clippers buzzing)

16:20.981 --> 16:22.371
It's a hairy curse.

16:22.390 --> 16:24.148
-It's tearing us apart.
-Teddy, stop!

16:24.300 --> 16:26.818
Don't do that.
I mean, do it if you want.

16:26.969 --> 16:27.986
Just not in our restaurant.

16:28.137 --> 16:29.970
I could, uh, uh, put a bus tub

16:30.048 --> 16:31.214
underneath to catch the hairs.

16:31.232 --> 16:32.548
Linda, no, don't encourage him.

16:32.641 --> 16:34.158
Get the bus tub, Linda.
I'm gonna do it.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.995
-Hello, sir. How are you?
-Sorry about this, sir.

16:37.146 --> 16:39.071
We're best friends.
We're going through a thing.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.498
Friends having mustache
troubles, you know.

16:40.575 --> 16:43.317
It's not mustache troubles.
Teddy, stop!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.836
Do you want to know
why I grew this thing?

16:45.063 --> 16:46.320
No, I don't.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.563
Because I thought
we could bond over it.

16:47.582 --> 16:49.173
And I thought we could use
a little bonding

16:49.400 --> 16:51.417
right about now,
considering what happened.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.069
What? Wh-What happened?

16:53.087 --> 16:54.420
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

16:54.572 --> 16:56.088
Remember a few weeks ago
when I told you

16:56.182 --> 16:58.683
the "It Takes Gouda to Make
a Thing Go Rye" burger

16:58.834 --> 17:01.244
-wasn't my favorite?
-I don't really remember.

17:01.262 --> 17:03.670
Oh, sure you do.
After that you got all quiet.

17:03.839 --> 17:05.339
Short one-word responses.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.859
I missed us.
I needed to do something.

17:08.010 --> 17:09.268
Teddy, I wasn't mad.
I think I might

17:09.437 --> 17:11.178
not have even been
listening to you.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.180
Teddy, give me the clippers.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.366
No. This thing's got
to go right now.

17:15.518 --> 17:18.036
I brought it into this world,
and I can take it out.

17:18.221 --> 17:20.538
No, Teddy, keep it.
It looks... great.

17:20.689 --> 17:23.708
I'm sorry I was annoyed
that you were talking about it.

17:23.859 --> 17:25.268
And constantly combing it.

17:25.361 --> 17:27.103
And constantly
going into the bathroom

17:27.272 --> 17:29.530
to play with it
so, so many times.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.942
Well, if you weren't mad at me
about the Burger of the Day,

17:33.111 --> 17:34.460
truth is,
I don't really want this thing.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.779
It's itchy, and I don't think
it really suits my face.

17:36.798 --> 17:38.389
Right? Am I right, sir?

17:38.582 --> 17:40.800
I-I can't tell.
Hold your finger up?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.134
-See?
-Yeah. Maybe no mustache.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.877
-It's coming off.
-Fine,

17:43.897 --> 17:45.121
but maybe not here, please?

17:45.123 --> 17:47.065
Okay, okay. I'll do it at home.

17:47.141 --> 17:49.067
Anyone want to give it
a touch before it's gone?

17:49.218 --> 17:50.851
-Bob?
-Bob, touch it.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.478
Touch his mustache.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.463
Oh, okay, fine.

17:54.632 --> 17:56.966
Huh. It's really silky.

17:56.984 --> 17:58.892
Hey, Bob, I want you
to have this.

17:59.028 --> 18:00.319
Oh. Thank you, Teddy.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.246
And just pay me
whatever you think is fair.

18:02.398 --> 18:04.064
It doesn't have
to be the full 75.

18:04.158 --> 18:05.975
I don't want
to pay anything for it.

18:06.068 --> 18:07.493
FISCHOEDER:
What a shot.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.495
You can barely see the seagull
poop on the railings.

18:09.647 --> 18:11.831
-Yeah, it's your best angle.
-It really is.

18:11.983 --> 18:13.925
-Mr. Fischoeder?
-Oh, hello,

18:14.152 --> 18:15.318
Mr. Little Girl.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.652
Well, we cleaned
the whole beach.

18:16.821 --> 18:18.745
So, I guess you owe us
a free day at the park.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.264
I'll need to check your work.

18:20.341 --> 18:21.748
I have a feeling
you missed some spots.

18:21.843 --> 18:25.085
Oh, are you talking about Mickey
and his secret trash stash?

18:25.179 --> 18:26.437
"Trash stash"?

18:26.664 --> 18:28.773
-Whatever could you mean?
-Over there.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.942
FISCHOEDER:
All I see is a shy
boogie-boarder

18:31.093 --> 18:32.593
darting behind a pole.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.337
Sonya, what do you think?
Do we have what we need?

18:34.430 --> 18:36.263
-Are we pamphlet-ready?
-I'd say so.

18:36.432 --> 18:37.931
Then, Felix? Peacock?

18:37.951 --> 18:40.368
(Felix squawking)

18:42.104 --> 18:43.346
Oh, no, look at that.

18:43.364 --> 18:45.181
Well, you know what they say.

18:45.199 --> 18:47.608
Trashy beach,
prize out of reach.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.202
-First of all, fun rhyme.
-Thank you, I know.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.797
Second of all, looks like you
got a real nice picture there.

18:52.948 --> 18:54.357
But so did I.

18:54.359 --> 18:55.949
And if you don't stick
to our deal,

18:56.043 --> 18:57.526
the world's gonna see this.

18:57.620 --> 19:00.363
A selfie of a heavily
made-up teen?

19:00.381 --> 19:02.365
No, the hermit crab behind her?

19:02.458 --> 19:04.383
With the Wonder Wharf-branded
foot-long taco dog

19:04.519 --> 19:06.978
cheesy chunk dipping sauce
container for a shell.

19:07.205 --> 19:09.221
-Hmm.
-Yeah. I'm gonna crop out Tammy,

19:09.374 --> 19:11.374
and I'm gonna put this picture
on all the social media

19:11.467 --> 19:13.376
I can figure out how to get on.

19:13.544 --> 19:15.711
And people are gonna get
real crabby about it.

19:15.730 --> 19:18.731
People get really upset about
sad animals who live in trash.

19:18.883 --> 19:20.232
Especially if they're cute.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.993
How cute is that crab?
Let me see it again?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.569
Ooh, he's pretty cute.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.164
Well, that's some terrific
blackmail, young lady.

19:26.315 --> 19:28.557
-I know. Good.
-I have no choice but to act.

19:28.576 --> 19:31.076
I mean, a thing like this
could be bad for my bottom line.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.561
Your butt crack? Oh! Got it.

19:32.580 --> 19:35.080
But shutting down
the wharf for a whole day,

19:35.233 --> 19:37.066
so you and your buddies
can get your jollies

19:37.084 --> 19:40.085
eating my lollies,
that costs a lot, too.

19:40.238 --> 19:42.087
-It does.
-Okay, fine.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.255
Starting today, I'm going to pay

19:43.408 --> 19:45.666
my carnie folk
to clean the beach.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.593
Yeah, you will. Wait, what?

19:47.745 --> 19:50.596
If your sad crab goes viral,
I'll just say we jumped

19:50.748 --> 19:52.506
into action the moment we became
aware of the situation,

19:52.600 --> 19:54.917
and just look at our carnies
clean.

19:54.919 --> 19:56.585
Hmm? With such gusto.

19:56.604 --> 19:58.754
-But...
-Felix, would you be
a plucky peacock,

19:58.847 --> 20:01.590
and tell Mickey to clean up
the trash he just threw?

20:01.684 --> 20:02.700
(Felix squawking)

20:02.927 --> 20:04.351
Huh?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.870
-He'll figure it out.
-Aah!

20:06.097 --> 20:07.596
No, it's not like that.
It's like this.

20:07.690 --> 20:08.781
(squawking)

20:09.692 --> 20:12.526
At least Mr. Fischoeder gave us
foot-long taco dogs.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.438
Yep, this thing's filling
a foot-long hole in my heart.

20:15.456 --> 20:17.882
Even though these are
the 10-inch long rejects.

20:18.109 --> 20:19.291
I should've negotiated.
We could, like,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.368
own a roller coaster
right now.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.462
I would take it,
like, everywhere.

20:23.614 --> 20:26.115
(groans) I blew it.
No three-quarters Wonka.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.725
Not even a wee Wonk.

20:27.876 --> 20:29.227
Louise, in your sort-of-selfish,

20:29.378 --> 20:31.470
sort-of-thoughtful,
mostly-selfish way,

20:31.622 --> 20:33.472
you did a really good thing
today.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.624
That beach is gonna be clean
from now on.

20:35.718 --> 20:37.401
I mean, maybe not totally clean.
Mickey doesn't seem

20:37.628 --> 20:39.645
to be very good
at picking up trash.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.314
Whoops. Whoops.

20:42.467 --> 20:43.908
But maybe now
there won't be any more crabs

20:44.059 --> 20:45.225
like Saucy on the beach.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.410
Saucy? You named it?

20:46.562 --> 20:48.471
Zeke did.
I think they're pen pals now.

20:48.473 --> 20:50.081
-Well, thanks, Tina.
-No problem.

20:50.232 --> 20:52.475
Hey, Gene, what happened
to your seagull stalker?

20:52.568 --> 20:54.477
I think he forgot about me.
Too bad for him.

20:54.570 --> 20:56.737
I would've let him have
a little bit of dog.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.980
