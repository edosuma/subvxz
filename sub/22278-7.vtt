00:06.400 --> 00:08.900
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:08.933 --> 00:11.433
Mother Nature shows no mercy.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.700
One mistake
can kill you out here.

00:13.733 --> 00:16.033
NARRATOR: An injury threatens
Sue's independence.

00:16.067 --> 00:17.133
SUE: Ouch.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.967
I'm in pain.
I need to get medicine.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.233
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
have a debt to pay.

00:21.267 --> 00:23.767
He set us up good.
We pay him back.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.633
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
returns to the unknown.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.967
GLENN: Oh, grizzly bear hair!

00:29.000 --> 00:30.367
NARRATOR:
And Andy's apprentice

00:30.400 --> 00:32.667
learns survival the hard way.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.067
Negative 40 degrees,
and I got no wood.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.233
(AIR WHOOSHING)

00:36.267 --> 00:37.267
(CRACKING)

00:51.567 --> 00:54.333
SUE: Wind's been howling.
I got a bit of snow.

00:54.367 --> 00:56.733
I can't get at my food,
'cause it's all snowed in.

00:56.767 --> 00:59.900
So, I can't get into
the freezer right now
until I can dig out the door,

00:59.933 --> 01:01.500
but the body's hurting.

01:01.533 --> 01:05.000
It's, the longer winter
goes on, the more
exhausted I get.

01:05.033 --> 01:06.333
So I gotta be careful.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.933
Out here it's not like you
can take a sick day.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.667
I don't get
two week's vacation,

01:10.700 --> 01:13.367
and a bunch of
sick days to toss around.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.600
You gotta get the work done
when you gotta get it done.

01:17.367 --> 01:20.333
NARRATOR: Isolated in a vast
frozen tundra,

01:20.367 --> 01:24.167
Sue's got only herself to deal
with whatever Mother Nature
throws at her.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.733
This is really built up
over the last few days.

01:27.767 --> 01:30.867
The tip of that little tent
right there,
that's my freezer tent.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.900
I need to, uh,
dig out the door.

01:32.933 --> 01:35.267
You know,
it's where my food is
for the winter.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
(CLANGING)

01:39.700 --> 01:43.700
I don't know
what temperature it is.
30, 40 below.

01:43.733 --> 01:47.000
Who in their right mind says,
"Let's grab the shovel
and dig."?

01:47.033 --> 01:51.033
But if I wanna eat,
probably a real good idea.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.567
Shovelling is the one motion
I gotta be careful of.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.967
'Cause you twist,

02:02.133 --> 02:03.833
(SPEAKING)

02:03.867 --> 02:05.200
(GRUNTS)

02:07.400 --> 02:08.600
Yes!

02:11.500 --> 02:13.700
So I got caribou heart
and bear back straps.

02:13.733 --> 02:17.267
You know,
and I can, uh, thaw that out,

02:17.300 --> 02:19.500
and there's a couple of nice
little meals for me.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.733
But I gotta get this
in my cubby.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.067
Get this thawing out,
and then get back to work.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.767
Ouch!

02:32.433 --> 02:33.700
Now that hurt.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.967
As I get older, the body
doesn't bend, it breaks.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.733
I get hurt bad enough
out here,
that could be the end.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.767
It's always good to work
with your family and
to work for yourself.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.933
CHIP: Money really has
no home.

02:48.967 --> 02:51.167
It gets spent almost
as fast as we make it.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.633
(DOGS BARKING)

03:00.800 --> 03:03.667
We got basically
what we call grubstaked
here in Alaska, by a fella,

03:03.700 --> 03:04.967
friend of ours named Kevin.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.633
And what he did was
he provided us with equipment

03:06.667 --> 03:09.033
so that we could
go do some gathering.

03:09.067 --> 03:11.767
-He traded to us a motor.
-(GUN SHOT)

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
The boat motor
got us some beavers.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.100
-It's gotten us caribou.
-(GUN SHOT)

03:17.833 --> 03:19.100
It's gotten us moose.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.400
And then my wife went out
with the son
and they got seals.

03:23.433 --> 03:24.900
(GRUNTING)

03:25.200 --> 03:26.367
(GROANS)

03:26.400 --> 03:28.800
And my wife's making
him a seal vest

03:28.833 --> 03:31.433
that's going to help pay off
the engine that we got.

03:31.467 --> 03:35.533
He set us up good.
We pay him back.
We all benefit.

03:35.567 --> 03:39.400
NARRATOR: Native villagers
depend on a barter system
to survive.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.667
If the Hailstones
don't honour this debt,

03:41.700 --> 03:44.467
they risk losing the good
faith of the community.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.633
Right now my wife is probably
scraping on the skin,

03:46.667 --> 03:48.133
and what I'm gonna do
is get her some alder bark.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.800
And the alder bark
makes a wonderful solution

03:49.833 --> 03:52.333
that not only dyes
the leather a beautiful red,

03:52.367 --> 03:55.400
it also helps tan the skin
and preserve it.

03:55.433 --> 03:57.667
With the subsistence
living that we do,

03:57.700 --> 03:59.500
we're fortunate
that the tanning solutions

03:59.533 --> 04:01.167
for the skins that we need
are right at hand,

04:01.200 --> 04:03.467
and everything I need
is out here.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.467
Various willows
have different textures.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.000
Water willows have yellow.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.300
Alder has red.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.600
That's what we're
looking for, red bark.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.667
This is what the dye
will be made out of.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.500
That's the red underneath.
That's where the tanning is.

04:17.533 --> 04:18.933
It's the natural way.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.100
Oh, sure smells, too.

04:23.267 --> 04:24.267
(TWIG BREAKING)

04:34.467 --> 04:38.767
I have, uh, four different
types of skin scrapers.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.133
Me, I prefer this one.

04:40.167 --> 04:43.500
This was my mother's
and we call them
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE),

04:43.533 --> 04:44.600
which means skin scraper.

04:44.633 --> 04:47.533
It's pretty much
just go over it like this,

04:47.567 --> 04:49.000
and take off all the extra,

04:50.267 --> 04:52.333
um, membrane and stuff.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.867
When I was growing up,

04:54.900 --> 04:57.167
there was me
and I had nine sisters.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.200
So we'd always
be around our mom,

04:59.233 --> 05:01.433
and she'd always have
all different kinds of skins,

05:01.467 --> 05:04.500
and we'll all sit down,
and we'd all learn
how to do it.

05:04.533 --> 05:07.133
-(SCRAPING)
-It's hard work
if you're not used to it,

05:07.167 --> 05:09.167
but it keeps you in shape.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.767
-Oh, yay! You found some?
-Sure did.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.533
-Look like that's
gonna be enough.
-CHIP: Yup.

05:22.567 --> 05:24.133
CHIP: I'm gonna put
all this in here.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.467
These are the shavings
from the alder.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.267
Then I'm gonna put them
in the water to simmer.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.100
Let her rip.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.800
CODY: It's colder
than hell out here.

05:38.833 --> 05:41.467
When you get cold
in this country, you gotta
get up and you gotta move.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.467
That means
you gotta put wood
in the stove.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.133
You gotta
take care of yourself.

06:01.467 --> 06:03.367
(SAWING)

06:05.667 --> 06:07.400
Stupid fucking stick.

06:07.767 --> 06:08.767
(GRUNTS)

06:09.733 --> 06:11.967
I just woke up,
(SNIFFS)

06:12.000 --> 06:15.067
and I can see my own
damn breath in my tent.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.000
Negative 40 degrees.

06:17.033 --> 06:20.333
I, uh, immediately
checked my fire,

06:20.367 --> 06:22.167
and it was out,
and I got no wood.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.600
You have to be in a certain
mind-set out here.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.833
You gotta think ahead,
and I wasn't thinking ahead.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.800
NARRATOR: New to life
in the bush,

06:29.833 --> 06:33.733
Cody Allen is learning
survival skills from Andy
and Kate Bassich.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.567
When you come out
into this environment
with this kind of cold,

06:36.600 --> 06:39.267
if you do the wrong thing
it can take your life.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.867
And actually
I'm hoping he makes mistakes,

06:41.900 --> 06:43.733
and I hope he has
a little bit of a struggle.

06:43.767 --> 06:46.567
'Cause that's when you learn
about how to
take care of yourself.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.733
That's not gonna
fucking cut it.

06:50.767 --> 06:51.833
I gotta go back.

06:51.867 --> 06:54.267
I gotta go get another tree.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.467
And there's no way in hell
I'm going out there
without a damn gun.

07:00.667 --> 07:04.300
Bears are probably
hibernating, but we still
got wolves, coyotes.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.833
Whatever wants to get at you
can if it's got the will
and the means.

07:08.933 --> 07:10.967
Trying to find
a deadfall tree.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.433
Anything that's still got
green on it
is gonna be wet,

07:13.467 --> 07:15.667
and it's not gonna burn
worth a damn.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.567
If I can find something that's
gonna be kind of easy to carry
back to camp,

07:18.600 --> 07:20.267
(SIGHING)
that would be my best bet.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.867
That might actually do.

07:29.033 --> 07:32.000
I'd say right about now
I'm kind of missing
my thermostat.

07:32.033 --> 07:36.267
You know, that's kind of
a get out of bed
and, "Oh, it's 65."

07:36.300 --> 07:40.233
I want 70 degrees.
I'm gonna go turn
that thing a quarter inch.

07:40.267 --> 07:46.233
And out here it's I wake up
and, "Oh, I can see my breath
and I can't feel my hands.

07:46.267 --> 07:49.367
"I'm gonna get dressed,
go spend 20 minutes walking
through the forest,

07:49.400 --> 07:54.300
"freezing cold, find a tree,
drag it back to camp,
cut it up,

07:54.333 --> 07:56.100
"try and get my fire
going again,

07:56.133 --> 08:00.500
"and then hopefully get
back into my sleeping bag
and get warmed up again."

08:00.533 --> 08:03.300
I'm freaking freezing.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.833
It's definitely
a different world,

08:04.867 --> 08:07.000
and I'm, you know,
kind of missing some
of the amenities right now.

08:07.033 --> 08:08.933
-It's just a dumb mistake.
-(SAWING)

08:08.967 --> 08:12.767
I don't need to be
attempting to get
frostbite at all.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.300
Which can very easily happen
in these temperatures.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.100
(CLATTERING)

08:23.333 --> 08:26.100
I'm gonna get my
birch wood in there.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.733
That'll start
the fire up nicely.

08:32.733 --> 08:35.033
Tonight could've
gotten really bad.

08:35.067 --> 08:37.533
You can't make
big mistakes out here.

08:37.567 --> 08:40.700
You make the wrong one
and you could be dead
in a heartbeat.

08:40.733 --> 08:43.833
CODY: I don't ever wanna go
through that again.

08:43.867 --> 08:46.933
But I kind of realise
my knowledge isn't where
it needs to be out here.

08:46.967 --> 08:49.667
I'm not set up in a way
that I'm efficient.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.100
I just don't exactly know
what I need to do.

08:52.133 --> 08:53.700
It's kind of scary.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.300
CHANDALAR: A lot of people
will find it frightening
to be out

08:58.333 --> 08:59.567
in the middle
of the wilderness,

08:59.600 --> 09:02.500
but I actually feel
really comfortable there.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.400
And that's why
I keep going back out there.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.233
-Andy, great.
Thanks for the lift.
-Okay.

09:25.267 --> 09:26.533
-Great to be back. Okay.
-We'll see you.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.233
-See you Andy.
-Stay warm!

09:28.267 --> 09:30.100
-Have a good flight.
-Thank you!

09:33.167 --> 09:36.233
My name's Glenn Villeneuve,
and I live here in Alaska.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.133
I came up here in 1999.

09:38.167 --> 09:42.967
I live a subsistence lifestyle
in the Brooks Range, about
200 miles North of Fairbanks.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.667
I got a really simple camp.
I hunt and gather
most of my food.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.367
Live pretty close to the land.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.967
I use mostly hand tools.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.367
I cut all my wood
with a axe or a hand saw.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.667
Cook all my food
on my wood stove.
I don't have propane.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.067
I've given up
a lot of technology
over the years,

09:58.100 --> 10:00.600
and living with
simpler technology today.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.167
Days are still pretty short
this time of year,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.500
so I wanna go get moved in
before it gets too late.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.233
It's been seven months
since I've been in my camp.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.567
Normally I hunt in the fall
get ready for winter,

10:13.600 --> 10:18.200
but this year I decided
to spend the fall
with my family in town.

10:18.233 --> 10:23.333
I don't like living in town,
because I really miss
being connected to nature.

10:23.367 --> 10:26.100
Basically I have to hit the
ground running, because
I gotta get a fire going

10:26.133 --> 10:28.533
in order to stay warm,
and in order to get
some water.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.833
'Cause the way
I'm gonna get water
is by melting snow.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.633
NARRATOR: 60 miles
from the nearest
point of civilisation,

10:35.667 --> 10:40.300
Glenn faces
every obstacle alone,
and with no lifelines.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.467
GLENN: I have grizzly bears
that come out,

10:42.500 --> 10:44.567
and sometimes
cause problems with the camp.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.633
One time I came in here,
there was a big hole
through the roof

10:46.667 --> 10:48.000
where a bear went through.

10:48.033 --> 10:49.667
The door was still closed,

10:49.700 --> 10:52.733
but I still won't know until
I walk up there exactly
what's happened since I left.

10:56.433 --> 10:58.700
I'm always
concerned about that.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.067
That maybe a bear's
caused damage.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.233
That's what I'm thinking about
walking up to the cabin.

11:08.933 --> 11:12.333
Just looking
for what's been going on.
I can see,

11:12.367 --> 11:14.033
you know, just tracks.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.667
I'm gonna walk over
to the cabin now,

11:16.700 --> 11:18.233
just take a closer look,
walk around it.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.733
See if anything happened.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.233
Oh, something there
isn't there?

11:26.733 --> 11:28.233
Grizzly bear hair.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.500
A grizzly has been here.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.400
Those are all grizzly bear
claw marks.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.867
Grizzly bears,
they come around here
and they rub on this cabin

11:36.900 --> 11:39.233
and scratch on it
all the time.

11:39.267 --> 11:42.633
But they only
went inside one time.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.500
I'm just gonna
take my snowshoes off
and walk around the cabin.

11:45.533 --> 11:47.067
See if I see anything.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.333
Back's all good.
Sides all good.

11:50.367 --> 11:53.167
Sometimes I've come up here
and the place is
just all ripped up.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.167
I've found this canvas
just in shreds.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.700
The bears are usually
hibernating this time of year,

11:58.733 --> 12:01.133
but occasionally
one will come out.

12:01.167 --> 12:04.200
Bears can be very destructive,
there's no question about it.

12:04.233 --> 12:08.567
A lot of the things
that I own have been
chewed on by bears.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.500
There's been a bear standing
right on my bed.

12:12.533 --> 12:13.767
Awesome!

12:14.767 --> 12:16.567
It's nice all the way around.

12:18.533 --> 12:19.833
Nothing ripped it up.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.333
I'm not sure what to expect.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.567
It can get wet
and then it can get
really mouldy.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.533
I think it'll be dry.
We'll see.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.400
Looks good.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.733
Everything looks
the way I left it.

12:41.767 --> 12:45.033
I just gotta go
get all my stuff
and bring it over here.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.967
It's gonna probably take
a couple more trips.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.467
Living in the Brooks Range
the way I do, it requires
a lot of physical work.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.367
But psychologically,
I actually find it easier than
living in modern society.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.867
I just feel really comfortable
living close to nature,

12:56.900 --> 12:59.033
and I miss that a lot
when I live in town.

12:59.067 --> 13:02.033
The final load.
Try to get moved in
before it gets dark.

13:06.233 --> 13:11.233
AGNES: We try our best
to teach our girls what we do.

13:11.267 --> 13:15.467
With all the fishing,
and the wood gathering,
and the harvesting of meat.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.500
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
are working hard
to finish a sealskin vest,

13:24.533 --> 13:26.533
to honour their debt
in a trade.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.200
At the end,
before I do all my alder dye,

13:30.233 --> 13:33.633
I just sand it up and get all
the rough stuff off.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.433
And usually
with all the other skins,

13:37.467 --> 13:40.067
Chip, and the boys,
and the other girls do them.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.833
But, uh, since my husband's
non-native,

13:42.867 --> 13:46.000
I have to work
on the sea mammal.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.467
My wife and my kids
can all do this stuff,
but legally I can't.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.733
She just carries on
with what her ancestors
have always done.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.400
Hi girls, sweetie pies.

13:57.433 --> 14:00.267
Why don't you come sit down
and check out
what your mom's up to.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.500
I'm just in the final stages
of sanding.

14:03.533 --> 14:06.000
I just have
this little section left.

14:06.033 --> 14:08.167
-How to do...
-See all these fuzzies?

14:08.200 --> 14:10.067
That's all
that needs to come off

14:10.100 --> 14:13.367
and we'll be done
with the sanding part.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.867
And then we'll move
on to dying it.

14:16.900 --> 14:22.000
Most of our traditions around
here are like, um, subsistence
things are for survival.

14:22.033 --> 14:24.800
For me, it's real important
that the girls,

14:24.833 --> 14:26.300
all five girls, uh,

14:26.333 --> 14:29.900
get to know all
the traditional things I do.

14:29.933 --> 14:32.567
Sometimes this environment
is real harsh,

14:32.600 --> 14:37.600
and the more the girls
get involved and hands on,
the more they'll know.

14:37.633 --> 14:40.500
-I have the dye!
-AGNES: Yay. Turned out good?

14:40.533 --> 14:42.733
It turned out like it should.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.900
Oh, like those willows
you always used, Daddy?

14:44.933 --> 14:46.900
-Yeah, these are alders.
-Alders.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.533
Yep, those are the willows
I used.

14:48.567 --> 14:51.233
I put these in, then I brought
the water to a boil,
and then I set it to simmer.

14:51.267 --> 14:53.600
You use this
and keep them back.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.300
I gotta see
what I'm doing though.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.267
You don't want to make
it too wet,

15:02.300 --> 15:05.000
and you don't want to try to
get the dye on this side.

15:05.033 --> 15:08.333
You just wanna try to
put it all over the top here.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.600
And you don't wanna
leave stuff pooling like that.

15:10.633 --> 15:12.633
-Make sure you stop.
-Whoa.

15:12.667 --> 15:15.067
There's all kinds
of different things

15:15.100 --> 15:17.467
that they need
to learn to survive

15:17.500 --> 15:22.533
and to pass down to their kids
and try to keep it in our
Inupiat traditional manner.

15:22.567 --> 15:26.033
It's something that you have
to be involved in because

15:26.067 --> 15:27.600
it's always doing something.
(CHUCKLES)

15:27.633 --> 15:29.800
-It's living.
-Yeah, it's living.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.667
There you go.
That's how you do it.

15:31.700 --> 15:35.500
CHIP: If we don't teach our
kids how to utilise the
materials, the animals,

15:35.533 --> 15:38.667
and the other things around
here to heat themselves,
shelter themselves,

15:38.700 --> 15:39.900
clothe themselves,
and make money,

15:39.933 --> 15:41.733
they're not gonna survive
very well.

15:41.767 --> 15:44.200
Looks like it's got
an even coat all over

15:44.233 --> 15:47.967
and you got the majority
of the little pools picked up.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.433
Good job, girls.

15:49.467 --> 15:50.700
You girls did real good.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.767
SUE: If I can't get
my body to work,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.733
the whole structure
of my life
is gonna fall apart.

15:57.767 --> 16:03.133
My life is absolutely
dependent on my ability
to get my chores done.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.433
NARRATOR: Sue threw her
back out shovelling snow,

16:09.467 --> 16:13.900
and every moment she's laid up
puts her very survival
in the arctic at risk.

16:13.933 --> 16:17.333
SUE: I need my mobility back
and right now I don't have it.

16:17.367 --> 16:20.167
It's working against my

16:20.200 --> 16:22.333
bull in a china shop nature

16:22.367 --> 16:24.067
to lay there and be docile.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.767
I need to clear my runway.
I need to move
a bunch of snow.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.633
I have to get that done.
There's nobody here
to help me.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.967
I don't appreciate weakness,

16:35.000 --> 16:39.067
and when I find it in myself
it's abhorrent to me.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.233
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:41.267 --> 16:44.767
It is important to me
to know that
I can rely on myself.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.600
Something I can do
to help myself is go
and get some willow,

16:50.633 --> 16:52.633
mack it up, and make some tea.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.700
Willow has Salic acid,
which is a pain reliever.

16:55.733 --> 17:00.367
So, what I'm gonna do
is look for a bush
I can get to...

17:00.400 --> 17:02.100
(PANTING)

17:02.133 --> 17:05.800
...that's fairly close
that I don't have to go
surfing in the deep snow.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.467
I think that's
my target over there.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.067
You have your vertebrae,
there's little cushions
called discs

17:12.100 --> 17:14.300
that do just that,
they cushion.

17:14.333 --> 17:18.233
So mine are,

spit out.

in between,

17:19.967 --> 17:21.433
they're spit out to the side.

Is surgery gonna be
in my future?

17:23.533 --> 17:25.533
I don't know, I hope not.

17:25.567 --> 17:28.033
Um, I just need to be...

17:28.067 --> 17:31.067
I need to be more resilient
to the pain,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.867

I gotta get better.
There's a whole world
of stuff I need to get doing.

SUE: These cells
of this plant are gonna leech
into that water.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.833
So, when I drink it
like you would tea,

18:06.867 --> 18:11.300
I will get the benefit
of a natural aspirin,
a natural pain reliever.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.233
My great grandma from Scotland

18:13.267 --> 18:15.600
had a million and one

"You're not a woman
if you cannot do it by hand."

18:21.567 --> 18:27.533
If you can't do it yourself,
if you can't make it, then
you're not... You're shit.

18:27.567 --> 18:31.600
So I got my drink.
I'll help myself with the pain
with that, hopefully.

18:31.633 --> 18:34.467
And it's hurry up and wait.

18:35.367 --> 18:38.067
It's frustrating.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.167
The colder temperatures
are on their way back.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.933
So, I need to get
as much work done as I can

18:43.967 --> 18:46.967
before the next snow
and windstorm sets in.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.867
Uh! Son of a bitch.

It's not working.

19:02.633 --> 19:03.900
I need to get medicine.

19:04.567 --> 19:05.933
Real medicine.

is a good boundary for me.

By the time I'm in tears

I am to be able to catch Bob,

The main thing it's gonna do
is bring me up off the ground
at a level angle with the wood

where I can actually
cut it easily,

If I got into any more
of a desperate situation,

23:07.300 --> 23:09.267
I probably would've ended up
freezing to death out here.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.467
And that's freaking scary.

23:15.067 --> 23:18.333
So far building this, it's,
uh, definitely a challenge.

back in time a bit.

you need.

Hey, Andy,
I got a question for you.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.467
When you were talking about
that punkie wood,

24:15.500 --> 24:17.100
the softer stuff, is that it?

24:18.100 --> 24:20.633
Yeah. It's all right.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.500
It's cold now, too,
so things get brittle

24:22.533 --> 24:25.667
and they tend to crack
and break easier
when it's cold.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.300
Uh, that's not gonna matter.

don't have that much daylight.

they're nice and long,
make excellent thread.

her skin sewing with that.

When you peel the membrane,
and extra fats, and stuff off

28:29.000 --> 28:32.633
it just starts to
separate by itself.

make it into thin strips,

-spin it, spin it, wet it.
-Wet.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.067
And then it becomes
a thread like that.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.800
And you go a few stitches
and then you put a knot there

28:46.833 --> 28:51.233
so in case it rips, the whole
thing won't just come apart.

35:18.100 --> 35:21.933
-A few pieces of wood, and...
-Oh, you know I need the heat.

35:21.967 --> 35:24.833
Looks like I'm gonna make out
real nice on this trade.

35:24.867 --> 35:27.067
-Yup, you sure are.
-Awesome.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.700
Well, this is what I have.

35:28.733 --> 35:31.700
-I hope it's acceptable.
-Seal?

35:31.733 --> 35:35.567
-AGNES: Yay!
-Ivory seals
with inlayed baleen eyes.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.433
AGNES: Wow, that looks cool.

35:37.467 --> 35:39.867
CHUCK: Oh, wow,
that's just beautiful.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.367
AGNES: Wow!

35:41.400 --> 35:44.467
I want to grubstake you now.
(LAUGHING)

35:47.800 --> 35:49.633
Yay! I'm on the last button.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.333
Feels pretty good
that I'm almost done.

35:53.367 --> 35:55.567
I've been working
at this project
for a few days,

35:55.600 --> 35:57.833
and it's been kind
of exciting.

35:57.867 --> 36:00.333
We caught this sealskin,
we tanned it.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.967
Um, we ate the meat,

36:03.000 --> 36:07.400
and, uh, now here we have it
turned into a seal skin vest.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.600
CHIP: For us it's like a way
to pay off the equipment.

36:09.633 --> 36:11.833
So it's a giant karma thing.
Where we're
helping each other.

36:11.867 --> 36:14.000
We're all getting
what we want in the end,
and it's a giant trade,

36:14.033 --> 36:15.933
but it's also kind of
a business deal.

36:15.967 --> 36:17.833
This is tied in
with subsistence obviously,

36:17.867 --> 36:20.100
because it's
the skin of an animal
that we caught and ate.

36:20.133 --> 36:24.867
AGNES: Not only
the sealskin vest,
the leather, the buttons,

36:24.900 --> 36:29.133
are all from the country.
So is the thread.

36:29.167 --> 36:31.500
So, I didn't really have
to pay for anything.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.733
CHIP: This is how
subsistence comes around.

36:34.533 --> 36:35.800
AGNES: Perfect.

36:35.833 --> 36:36.933
CHIP: Get up and put it on.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.067
Wow.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.933
-Probably gonna
fit him perfect, huh?
-I think he'll like it.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.067
AGNES: Good deal.

36:54.667 --> 36:59.100
SUE: When I'm the only one
that I count on in the winter
to get my chores done,

36:59.133 --> 37:02.767
you know, the only ass
that gets kicked for not
completing the job is my own.

37:09.033 --> 37:11.800
Today is the day.
I've got good conditions here.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.767
Bob has good conditions there.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.867
Um, so he's gonna try
and make my medicine drop.

37:17.900 --> 37:21.033
(PANTING)
Uh, one snag, one little fly
in the ointment is

37:21.067 --> 37:23.433
on my runway.
I have not been
able to go out.

37:23.467 --> 37:24.933
I got some snow,
a little bit of wind.

37:24.967 --> 37:27.633
So, I may have drifts on it.

37:27.667 --> 37:32.500
What's hidden underneath
this little bit of snow
is ice, glare ice.

37:32.533 --> 37:36.233
So, that's the danger.
He can't see where it is.
I can't tell him where it is.

37:36.267 --> 37:39.600
I'm not in good enough shape
to get on my equipment
and groom it for him.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.667
So, he's gonna have to do
what we call an airdrop.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.133
He's gonna line up
with the runway,

37:43.167 --> 37:44.667
and then go as slow as he can,

37:44.700 --> 37:46.700
open up the door,
and kick it out of the window.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.733
Hey, Bob.
You got a copy on Sue?

37:50.667 --> 37:51.700
(BOB SPEAKING)

37:54.133 --> 37:55.767
Zero wind.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.333
(BOB SPEAKING)

37:57.367 --> 38:00.300
I'll start making
my way out towards the runway,

38:00.333 --> 38:03.000
but if you can give me
a minute, I'm a little bit
of a slowpoke.

38:03.467 --> 38:04.967
(BOB SPEAKING)

38:06.000 --> 38:08.933
Come on Sue. Come on. Fuck!

38:08.967 --> 38:11.300
SUE: Okay.
He's gonna start lining up.

38:11.333 --> 38:13.767
I am in position
and ready, buddy.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.700
(PANTING)

38:16.700 --> 38:19.667
Okay. Here we go.
Fuck me, it hurts.

38:19.700 --> 38:22.167
My left leg is shaking.
It wants to give out.

38:22.733 --> 38:23.800
Fuck.

38:23.833 --> 38:25.200
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

38:25.233 --> 38:26.333
Don't hit me in the head.

38:30.167 --> 38:32.033
He should open it up
right around now.

38:37.567 --> 38:38.733
Boom!

38:39.467 --> 38:41.733
Got it, buddy.
Right on target.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.700
(LAUGHING)

38:46.733 --> 38:51.167
Most of it made it on target.
It's to be taken with food,
so he gave me food, too.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.267
The food just didn't happen
to make it quite as much.

38:54.300 --> 38:56.300
Yay!

38:56.333 --> 38:59.800
Bob, I really appreciate it.
I want you to fly safe.

38:59.833 --> 39:01.000
(BOB SPEAKING)

39:03.567 --> 39:04.900
Thank you, Bob.

39:06.233 --> 39:07.567
(GRUNTS)

39:07.600 --> 39:08.933
(GROANING)

39:10.800 --> 39:12.200
(PANTING)

39:13.233 --> 39:17.167
Three days,
and I've got some medicine.

39:18.167 --> 39:20.300
It's emotional for me

39:21.400 --> 39:24.400
that people
will help me like that.

39:24.433 --> 39:27.100
It makes me
wanna be a better person.

39:27.133 --> 39:30.900
The next challenge
after I start healing

39:30.933 --> 39:34.033
is to slow my
natural personality down,

39:34.067 --> 39:36.100
and say, "Okay. Baby steps.

39:36.133 --> 39:38.333
"Baby steps.
Let's be a toddler on this."

39:38.367 --> 39:41.133
And I wanna go gangbusters
and be a football team.

39:43.833 --> 39:46.700
"Take one tablet by mouth,
three times a day."

39:47.500 --> 39:49.400
Ah!

39:49.433 --> 39:51.700
It's for the swelling.
Anti-inflammatory.

39:54.233 --> 39:57.900
I'm hoping that 24 hours
or less,

39:57.933 --> 40:01.767
for being mobile enough
to get some things done.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.333
What I need to do,

40:05.367 --> 40:07.200
get under these things
right here,

40:09.300 --> 40:11.500
and let the medicine
do its work.

40:14.433 --> 40:15.900
(SIGHING)

40:19.433 --> 40:20.933
Time for healing.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.633
CODY: I don't care
how cold it gets.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.200
I don't care
how tough it gets.

40:28.233 --> 40:30.567
I don't care if I'm freezing
in the middle of the night.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.867
I don't care if I'm hungry.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.033
I'm sort of answering my call
to the wild

40:49.433 --> 40:51.533
I think it's about time
to start getting my wood
cut up.

40:51.567 --> 40:54.467
So, that way I got wood
stacked up on the side
before it gets dark,

40:54.500 --> 40:57.567
and have stuff to burn
throughout the night
so I don't freeze to death.

41:03.433 --> 41:04.933
It's gonna keep me
off the ground.

41:04.967 --> 41:06.600
It's gonna make it
a lot easier for me

41:06.633 --> 41:09.067
to get two hands on the saw.

41:09.100 --> 41:12.267
Cut through a piece,
slide over,
get my next piece.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.433
My knees aren't gonna
be packed down in snow.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.733
It's also gonna make
everything just go
a lot quicker.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.867
'Cause with how short
the days are out here.

41:24.900 --> 41:28.300
You know, you gotta get
enough wood built up to keep
you warm throughout the night.

41:30.067 --> 41:31.067
(SIGHING)

41:36.567 --> 41:38.833
Last piece for the night!

41:50.133 --> 41:53.667
Kind of getting a little
bit more settled in here
than when I first showed up.

41:53.700 --> 41:56.733
I got a, a great little
contraption over there

41:56.767 --> 41:58.400
that really just made,

41:58.433 --> 42:01.200
with the daylight
that we have out here, two
to three days' worth of work,

42:01.233 --> 42:02.833
of on the ground work,
(SNIFFS)

42:02.867 --> 42:06.033
freezing cold,
standing up now.

42:06.067 --> 42:09.633
And I knocked it out
in three or four hours, so...

42:12.267 --> 42:14.333
Cody's completed
his, uh, project

42:14.367 --> 42:17.000
to learn how to use
some basic hand tools.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.700
ANDY: I think he did
a pretty good job.

42:18.733 --> 42:20.200
He's not afraid
of the hard work.

42:20.233 --> 42:23.933
And he seems to be
highly motivated
to wanna live this lifestyle.

42:23.967 --> 42:25.467
And that's what it takes.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.933
(FIRE CRACKLING)

42:30.767 --> 42:36.067
One of the first major lessons
I learnt out here
is being prepared.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.233
I mean, running out of
firewood in the middle
of the night,

42:38.267 --> 42:39.533
that was just dumb.

42:39.567 --> 42:41.167
But I learnt my lesson
from that.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.967
Just from that night,
I can see myself looking
a little farther ahead

42:45.000 --> 42:46.567
in everything I do.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.000
You know, is this gonna
help me for the next
15 minutes,

42:49.033 --> 42:51.100
or is this gonna help me
for the next 15 years?

42:52.200 --> 42:53.433
If you think
short term out here,

42:53.467 --> 42:55.700
then you're gonna end up
in a ditch pretty quick.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.233
After the experiences
I just went through,

42:59.267 --> 43:01.567
I'm feeling damn proud,
damn happy,

43:01.600 --> 43:03.967
and good to be alive.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.100
