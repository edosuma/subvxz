WEBVTT

00:09.508 --> 00:13.445
That's it. That's it. Nice and slow.

00:53.819 --> 00:55.854
Shit.

00:57.956 --> 00:59.792
Yo, Christine!

01:00.092 --> 01:03.495
Christine, I love you.

01:03.595 --> 01:07.153
How many times
you want me to say it? I fu...

01:08.033 --> 01:10.069
I love...

01:10.969 --> 01:13.539
I fucking love you!

01:22.981 --> 01:25.517
I love you!

01:31.790 --> 01:33.692
Good.

01:35.627 --> 01:38.096
Come on, follow me.
We're gonna do this together.

01:38.196 --> 01:42.034
Up, down. Up, down. Up, down.

01:42.134 --> 01:44.970
Up and press up.

01:45.070 --> 01:49.174
Toes pointed and down. And press up.

01:49.274 --> 01:51.443
And down.

01:51.543 --> 01:54.546
Beautiful. Up. We're all a team.
We stay together.

01:54.646 --> 01:58.317
And down. Don't cheat.
Stay with your teammates. Everybody up.

01:58.417 --> 02:01.186
Push, push, push!

02:01.286 --> 02:03.489
Pull in your navel!

02:03.589 --> 02:06.591
Through your sphincter!

02:09.627 --> 02:11.363
Push 'em up!

02:11.463 --> 02:14.633
Down! Up!

02:14.733 --> 02:17.135
Down! Put those elbows in.

02:17.235 --> 02:20.706
Squeeze up. Beautiful.

02:20.806 --> 02:22.040
Down.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.850
Touch the ground.

02:26.111 --> 02:29.848
James Brown. Touch the ground.

02:29.948 --> 02:31.049
Get down.

02:31.149 --> 02:33.719
Now, plank position.

02:33.819 --> 02:37.723
Your forearms should be pointed forward,
straight ahead.

02:37.823 --> 02:41.694
90 degrees, feet together.

02:42.394 --> 02:45.965
Susan, elbows under your shoulder.

02:49.434 --> 02:50.936
These are your shoulders.

02:51.036 --> 02:56.809
Imagine a straight line going down
to the floor, straight ahead.

03:00.112 --> 03:02.381
Straight down.

03:02.647 --> 03:05.617
- Can I help you, sir?
- I don't want to interrupt anything.

03:05.717 --> 03:08.053
No, no, no, no.
This is the perfect time.

03:08.153 --> 03:11.256
These guys could hold plank
all day, right?

03:11.356 --> 03:12.991
Butt up!

03:13.091 --> 03:15.627
Monica, not that high.

03:16.027 --> 03:19.631
You're a plank. Solid rock.

03:21.633 --> 03:24.402
Yeah, I was hoping
to get in shape a little bit.

03:24.502 --> 03:27.339
A little bit? All right.

03:27.839 --> 03:29.141
Can I help you, sir?

03:29.241 --> 03:32.211
Yeah, you can help me.
You can all help me.

03:33.011 --> 03:35.881
Why don't you step into my office,
and I'll tell you a bit about what we do here

03:35.981 --> 03:38.850
and we can talk about some
of your personal fitness goals?

03:39.017 --> 03:42.721
You can take a seat, if you like.
You don't have to, though.

03:46.591 --> 03:49.628
Fear excuses surrender?

03:51.175 --> 03:53.911
No. It's...

03:56.234 --> 03:58.403
No fear.

03:58.503 --> 04:00.459
What can we do for you?

04:00.559 --> 04:05.544
I was looking in your window, and I thought,
you know, "I got to get in shape."

04:05.777 --> 04:07.379
Yeah, I can relate to that.

04:07.479 --> 04:11.282
Every time I see Lorenzo's abs,
I think I got to stop eating tacos.

04:11.850 --> 04:15.287
Are you... Are you currently...
doing any form of consistent exercise?

04:15.387 --> 04:18.690
- Have you spent much time in gyms?
- Fuck, no.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.159
Okay, well, that's all right.
No problem.

04:21.259 --> 04:24.896
Well, just... just to give you
a little bit of our philosophy here...

04:24.996 --> 04:26.898
Look, firstly, my name's Trevor.

04:26.998 --> 04:29.267
- I'm Danny.
- Danny, Danny.

04:30.796 --> 04:34.022
I am the founder and owner
of Power 4 Life.

04:34.122 --> 04:36.524
And I've... you know, I've often
got people coming up to me asking,

04:36.624 --> 04:41.199
"Hey, Trevor, what's the 4
in Power 4 Life?"

04:41.299 --> 04:46.117
Put it simply, it's physical,
mental, emotional, and spiritual.

04:46.217 --> 04:47.819
Now, obviously,
when you take on a trainer,

04:47.919 --> 04:50.622
you're primarily concentrating
on the physical,

04:50.722 --> 04:52.624
but I think the thing that separates us

04:52.724 --> 04:56.261
from all the other boot camps
and trainers and gyms out there

04:56.361 --> 04:59.326
is that we're very aware
that those four elements

04:59.426 --> 05:02.100
work in conjunction
with each other all the time.

05:02.200 --> 05:02.993
Yeah.

05:03.093 --> 05:05.304
Look, I know I can go on
a bit and stuff, so I won't.

05:05.404 --> 05:08.407
So, what are your goals?
What do you think you're after?

05:08.507 --> 05:13.845
Well, you know, I mean, I got money,
so I can pay for whatever.

05:15.113 --> 05:18.016
That's good, yeah. Fine, that's fine.

05:18.116 --> 05:22.754
I guess what I really want... I just...
I want to be able to take a punch.

05:22.854 --> 05:25.190
- I want to be able to, like...
- So, boxing, yeah?

05:25.290 --> 05:28.160
Yeah, but I'm not gonna get
in the ring, I don't think.

05:28.260 --> 05:33.464
Like, say you hit me here
or here, here, or right here.

05:34.264 --> 05:39.738
I just want to be able to take it
without falling down or... or, you know,

05:39.838 --> 05:43.080
puking or bleeding...

05:43.866 --> 05:46.311
too much. Just...

05:46.411 --> 05:49.047
Yeah, yeah.

05:49.547 --> 05:51.879
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah, of course.

06:46.872 --> 06:49.307
- Kat.
- Hey.

06:49.407 --> 06:52.310
So funny to see you here.
We were just at a birthday party.

06:52.410 --> 06:54.887
Barrett, do you remember
my trainer, Kat? Can you say hi?

06:54.987 --> 06:57.082
Hey, buddy. How's that cupcake?

06:57.182 --> 07:00.185
My gosh, busted.

07:00.285 --> 07:02.821
Technically, it was Barrett's,
but I did have a couple bites,

07:02.921 --> 07:04.356
and I was gonna put it in my food log.

07:04.456 --> 07:08.494
- No, look. I am not the food police, Laura.
- I think it's pretty obvious by now,

07:08.594 --> 07:11.763
I'm not perfect about food,
and I'm not trying to be.

07:11.863 --> 07:14.566
Also... you're behind on payment, Laura.

07:16.043 --> 07:17.035
What?

07:17.135 --> 07:20.138
You know, it doesn't
bother me if you lie to me.

07:20.238 --> 07:22.490
I truly don't give a S.H.I.T.

07:22.590 --> 07:26.478
- S.H.I.T.
- But if you lie to yourself, right?

07:26.578 --> 07:27.939
Bye, bud.

07:32.884 --> 07:36.804
- Okay, is everybody ready?
- Yeah, everyone smiling, showing teeth?

07:36.904 --> 07:38.690
Don't you think at least
one of us should look mean?

07:38.790 --> 07:41.810
No, overruled, mate.
We're a united, smiling front.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.112
We're good.

07:44.312 --> 07:46.147
So, is he supposed to look mean, or not?

07:46.247 --> 07:48.967
- Hey, sorry.
- Akim, don't...

07:49.067 --> 07:53.054
- The princess has arrived.
- Where's your shirt?

07:53.638 --> 07:56.458
Looks like a family
Christmas photo, man.

07:56.558 --> 07:58.343
Even though so many of us
have had sex with each other.

07:58.443 --> 08:02.464
Mate, I don't want to know about
your personal lives. I really don't, okay?

08:02.614 --> 08:04.883
Kat, hurry up.

08:05.216 --> 08:08.286
Akim, smile, mate, or you're fired.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.812
See you tomorrow, bro.

08:16.912 --> 08:18.930
Hey, Kat!

08:21.533 --> 08:25.704
Did you... Did you jump on Laura Brant's
car and harass her or something?

08:25.804 --> 08:28.206
I did not jump on her car.

08:28.306 --> 08:31.776
I mean, she owes you money, Trevor.
She's a deadbeat.

08:32.306 --> 08:34.946
No, her credit card's expired, and we
just haven't got the new one on file yet.

08:35.046 --> 08:37.782
- Deadbeat.
- Collection's not even your problem.

08:37.881 --> 08:40.419
Well, yes, it is my problem if I am
getting paid out per session, Trevor.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.255
You'll get paid for every session
that you do. It's my problem, okay?

08:44.355 --> 08:49.437
Trevor, you said you were gonna
text me the contact info for the walk-in.

08:49.537 --> 08:53.665
Yeah, I did. I mean,
I didn't, but I'll do it now.

08:53.765 --> 08:56.801
And I'll work out schedule and goals
with him. We'll make it work.

08:56.901 --> 08:58.870
Yep. Okay, great.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.840
We had a walk-in? Did he request...
Lorenzo specifically, or...

09:02.940 --> 09:06.378
Really? You weren't here.
You haven't even met the guy,

09:06.478 --> 09:09.126
but all of a sudden,
he's your client that I'm stealing?

09:09.226 --> 09:12.350
- Don't provoke her. Don't provoke her.
- Yeah, stop fucking provoking me.

09:12.450 --> 09:16.187
I know you're looking for more clients,
but it's an executive decision, okay?

09:16.287 --> 09:21.292
Kat, reality check. You're already working
seven days a week. You're unfocused.

09:21.392 --> 09:24.062
You know what? You know, Trevor,
I'd like you to finish your explanation here

09:24.162 --> 09:26.632
- because I truly don't understand why...
- Don't provoke me. Don't provoke me.

09:26.732 --> 09:31.069
- Trevor is trying to run a business.
- Fuck off! You're a bisexual gigolo!

09:31.169 --> 09:35.673
Part of achieving excellence
is delivering excellence consistently.

09:35.773 --> 09:38.947
- And I'm sorry, what did you just call me?
- Listen, just call him, okay?

09:39.047 --> 09:42.647
Give him a call and let me know
what you work out, all right? Fuck.

09:42.747 --> 09:44.282
- Thanks.
- You made him so mad.

09:44.382 --> 09:47.485
Kat, don't fuck with a lion.

09:48.753 --> 09:51.823
I wouldn't want to touch you.
Wouldn't want to go near you.

09:53.225 --> 09:56.695
- This is my car.
- Sorry.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.337
Don't do it, Kat. Don't come in here.
Just turn around.

10:05.837 --> 10:10.708
Do you ever read the feedback forms
you make clients fill out?

10:10.808 --> 10:13.445
Why don't you ever say anything nice
to me first before you attack?

10:13.545 --> 10:19.208
- Why isn't that part of your strategy?
- Who is... your highest ranked trainer?

10:19.308 --> 10:22.387
I don't know. I haven't crunched
the numbers yet.

10:23.463 --> 10:26.124
Why would you make people
fill out these forms

10:26.224 --> 10:30.628
if you're not gonna crunch the
numbers, man? That's not optimized.

10:30.728 --> 10:35.734
Well, why don't you... pull up
the... spreadsheet? I'll wait.

10:35.834 --> 10:40.005
- I know you score high.
- I Sc... clients fucking love me, Trevor.

10:40.105 --> 10:43.675
Look, they don't see the dark side
unless they fuck with me

10:43.775 --> 10:46.244
or they fuck with your business.

10:46.344 --> 10:50.415
And if they're cool,
then I'm their best friend.

10:50.515 --> 10:54.619
Look, the guy was weird, okay?
He just gave off a weird vibe.

10:54.719 --> 10:56.921
He wanted privates at home. That's fine.

10:57.021 --> 10:59.491
But when I asked him
about his personal fitness goals,

10:59.591 --> 11:01.626
he just got more fucking weird.

11:01.726 --> 11:05.830
And... I just wouldn't feel comfortable
sending you over there.

11:05.930 --> 11:09.234
- He's a rapist.
- I have no idea. Maybe.

11:09.334 --> 11:12.203
And he's like a big guy, big trouble?

11:12.303 --> 11:15.074
Yeah, hand to hand in a fair fight,
you would break his neck,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.441
but I can't count
on a fair fight, can I?

11:17.541 --> 11:20.079
I'm just not prepared
to take the risk, all right?

11:21.079 --> 11:23.481
Geez, now I'm worried
about Lorenzo and his...

11:23.581 --> 11:25.117
Come on, I'm setting the alarm.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.868
You're such a juvenile.

11:43.968 --> 11:47.305
I can't believe I haven't earned
your trust by now.

12:00.568 --> 12:02.648
So.

12:03.121 --> 12:05.445
Well, listen...
this is an intro session,

12:05.545 --> 12:08.826
and it's really just about me getting
to know you and you getting to know me

12:08.926 --> 12:11.763
- and sort of starting on a plan together.
- All right.

12:12.163 --> 12:15.232
So, what I'd like you
to do is... keep a food log.

12:15.332 --> 12:19.103
That means, you know,
writing it down on a piece of paper,

12:19.203 --> 12:22.006
e-mailing it to me,
or now some of my clients,

12:22.106 --> 12:25.276
they'll take a picture of the food they're
eating and send it to me. Boom, easy.

12:25.376 --> 12:30.882
So, anything that goes into your body
that isn't water, we track it.

12:31.182 --> 12:34.685
- That's intense.
- Yeah.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.520
Payment...

12:36.620 --> 12:39.791
you could either pay by...
check or PayPal.

12:39.891 --> 12:44.962
We usually bill monthly, but we can
schedule it however works for you.

12:45.062 --> 12:49.433
Okay. I don't know.
Can't I just pay in advance?

12:49.533 --> 12:53.271
- Yeah.
- Like, how about...

12:53.371 --> 12:56.908
I don't know, how much
for a year or two?

13:00.878 --> 13:03.515
- Okay, well... see you on Thursday.
- All right, Thursday.

13:03.615 --> 13:05.350
Yep.

13:05.450 --> 13:08.520
You know, I have a pool too,
right over there.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.483
Okay.

13:33.544 --> 13:36.271
Hey. Keep the change.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.830
Let's talk about food.

14:43.930 --> 14:47.918
I think that it's really great that
you were honest about what you ate.

14:48.018 --> 14:51.356
But... if it wasn't hunger,

14:51.456 --> 14:54.258
what do you think was going on there?

14:55.660 --> 14:58.363
- Boredom.
- Boredom, okay.

14:58.463 --> 15:03.301
Well, maybe you could've invited
somebody over to share the pizza with you.

15:05.007 --> 15:06.703
Maybe.

15:06.803 --> 15:11.309
Yeah, maybe or maybe not.
It's up to you, right?

15:15.279 --> 15:18.149
Boredom and depression.

15:18.683 --> 15:21.986
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

15:22.086 --> 15:23.988
Do you ever...

15:24.088 --> 15:27.558
Do you ever see anybody about that?

15:30.060 --> 15:35.355
- Like a shrink or something?
- Yeah, or a... trained professional.

15:41.005 --> 15:43.188
I don't know.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.376
Do you?

15:45.476 --> 15:49.414
I have. I've tried it.

15:50.515 --> 15:53.351
And what, you didn't like it?

15:56.654 --> 15:58.890
You know, it's...

15:58.990 --> 16:01.959
it's like training with somebody.

16:02.059 --> 16:06.330
You know, you just have
to trust in the process.

16:06.430 --> 16:10.034
And it feels kind of awkward
at first, but when you...

16:10.134 --> 16:14.906
You know, I'm not saying that a shrink
can save your life every time, but...

16:15.006 --> 16:16.474
A trainer can save your life?

16:16.774 --> 16:19.698
- I don't know.
- You know.

16:19.798 --> 16:23.131
Let's hit it. Let's get you
warmed up. Okay?

16:23.231 --> 16:27.185
Bend at the waist, stick your butt out,
and drop down, okay?

16:27.285 --> 16:28.886
Keep your core tight
throughout the whole thing.

16:28.986 --> 16:32.690
Let's just try one, see how we do. Okay?

16:32.790 --> 16:35.226
All right. And come right back up.

16:35.326 --> 16:37.729
Push up through your heels.
There you go.

16:37.829 --> 16:41.766
Okay. I'm sorry,
is touch okay or not okay?

16:41.866 --> 16:43.067
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

16:43.167 --> 16:47.872
I just want to make a quick adjustment
back here. Doing really well. Get that...

16:47.972 --> 16:50.274
Okay, you got to tell me if something
doesn't feel good, okay?

16:50.374 --> 16:51.476
- No, it was good.
- It was okay?

16:51.576 --> 16:52.877
- It was okay.
- Okay.

16:52.977 --> 16:56.280
So, this is tight throughout.
Keep these shoulders really tight.

16:56.380 --> 16:59.684
Core is tight. Imagine there's,
like, a wall behind your butt,

16:59.784 --> 17:03.054
and you're trying to, like,
break through it, okay?

17:06.357 --> 17:10.661
And let's pop right back up.
Yep, okay, let's just stop there.

17:10.761 --> 17:13.132
We're just trying to get the alignment
right. It's kind of tricky at first.

17:13.232 --> 17:17.099
- Feels kind of unnatural, right?
- Knock a wall down with my butt?

17:17.200 --> 17:20.405
Yeah, knock a wall down with your butt,
You know, knock over your sadness.

17:20.505 --> 17:25.576
Knock over your anxiety. Knock over,
you know, anything that makes you mad.

17:25.675 --> 17:27.044
- Yeah.
- Control your descent when you go.

17:27.144 --> 17:30.548
Don't just drop down. Control it down.

17:31.428 --> 17:34.685
You know what? I'm gonna show you a few.
I just want you to get this form right.

17:34.785 --> 17:37.488
All right, here we go.

17:37.588 --> 17:42.260
And I lead with my butt. See?

17:46.464 --> 17:48.265
Okay, you see my form?

17:48.365 --> 17:50.641
- Yes.
- See how everything is tight?

17:50.741 --> 17:53.371
<i>Nine. Last one, ten.</i>

17:53.471 --> 17:56.073
<i>Great, swap it out. Swap it out.
Big focus, come on, big focus.</i>

17:56.173 --> 18:01.478
<i>I started Power 4 Life because I wanted
to give people power for their own lives.</i>

18:01.578 --> 18:05.783
<i>When I hear someone say,
"I wish I had the perfect body,"</i>

18:05.883 --> 18:08.820
<i>I think to myself, what is that?</i>

18:08.920 --> 18:11.022
<i>We all have our own perfection.</i>

18:11.122 --> 18:13.457
<i>Maybe you want to compete in a marathon.</i>

18:13.557 --> 18:17.829
<i>Or maybe you just want to feel
super-confident in a bikini.</i>

18:17.929 --> 18:21.313
<i>Or maybe all you're after
is that little bit of extra energy</i>

18:21.413 --> 18:25.870
<i>when you get home from work so you've
got energy to play with your kids.</i>

18:26.704 --> 18:28.773
<i>Close your eyes...</i>

18:30.908 --> 18:34.679
<i>and hold that goal in your mind.</i>

18:40.785 --> 18:42.853
<i>And make it happen.</i>

18:42.953 --> 18:47.492
<i>Physical, mental, emotional,
and spiritual.</i>

18:48.025 --> 18:51.362
<i>...it's all coming from here. It's got
to come from the back in here, okay?</i>

18:51.462 --> 18:54.265
<i>Yeah. And one more.</i>

18:54.365 --> 18:57.501
<i>Good. I'm gonna give you
ten pound weights.</i>

18:57.601 --> 19:00.496
<i>Really? Okay.</i>

19:01.322 --> 19:04.342
<i>Honestly, I had been
to a lot of trainers before,</i>

19:04.442 --> 19:07.011
<i>and I had never found a program
that I could stick with</i>

19:07.111 --> 19:10.214
<i>until I started working with Kat.
She's amazing.</i>

19:10.314 --> 19:13.985
<i>She loves her job, she loves life,</i>

19:14.085 --> 19:17.021
<i>and it just makes you want
to work harder and do better.</i>

19:17.721 --> 19:22.061
<i>Your back really straight, and then
you push with your butt, right?</i>

19:23.561 --> 19:26.430
<i>Push that out,
and you kind of lead with it.</i>

19:26.530 --> 19:28.342
<i>Try to go as deep as you can, okay?</i>

20:56.087 --> 20:59.456
Hey... hey, what's up, man?

20:59.556 --> 21:01.492
I like your hat.

21:01.592 --> 21:04.675
I don't mean to bother you.

21:05.262 --> 21:07.031
You...

21:07.131 --> 21:09.386
I'm new in town, so...

21:09.486 --> 21:11.839
I got a kind of dumb question
I was wondering if you could help me with.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.117
Do you smoke?

21:14.705 --> 21:18.809
You know where I can get some... weed?

21:21.111 --> 21:23.081
Do I look like a drug dealer to you?

21:23.581 --> 21:28.551
Drugs, not... I mean, weed, weed, weed.

21:31.021 --> 21:35.326
- I'm an undercover cop.
- Are you really?

21:36.427 --> 21:38.900
Well... bullshit.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.834
- You got a badge? Show me your badge.
- No, I'm kidding. I'm not a cop.

21:44.401 --> 21:46.721
- I am a lawyer, though.
- Yeah?

21:46.821 --> 21:48.839
Yeah? What kind? Criminal lawyer?

21:48.939 --> 21:51.523
No, no, commercial...

21:51.623 --> 21:55.045
business. You know, contracts and shit.

21:55.145 --> 21:57.548
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:58.215 --> 22:01.318
- Hey, you got a card?
- You want... you want my card?

22:01.418 --> 22:03.687
Yeah, if you got one.

22:05.055 --> 22:08.058
All right, yeah. I'll give you my card.

22:14.865 --> 22:16.934
- No shit.
- Yeah.

22:17.034 --> 22:20.668
I could probably use
someone like you on the...

22:21.068 --> 22:22.737
team.

22:23.607 --> 22:27.472
Hey, I could probably help you
with that other thing, too, if you want.

22:27.572 --> 22:28.513
Good.

22:54.071 --> 22:56.098
Okay.

22:57.408 --> 23:00.445
<i>So you agree... it's 2014.</i>

23:00.545 --> 23:03.881
<i>Alejandra, he's a pretty boy.
He gets a lot of attention.</i>

23:03.981 --> 23:06.851
- All right, so.
- Yeah, just pretty much, just, you know,

23:06.951 --> 23:09.387
that button for on and off,
and then, I mean,

23:09.487 --> 23:11.455
you could probably figure
the rest of these out.

23:11.555 --> 23:13.690
Just leave that for you here.

23:13.790 --> 23:17.305
- All right, man, there you go.
- Thank you.

23:17.405 --> 23:19.496
Hey...

23:19.596 --> 23:24.401
Can you do this?
Can you hook this up to that screen?

23:24.501 --> 23:29.439
So that I could do computer stuff...
watch computer stuff on that?

23:29.539 --> 23:31.575
- Yeah, I could probably do that.
- Another 100 bucks, bro.

23:31.675 --> 23:34.912
<i>Just makes you want to work
harder and do better.</i>

23:35.012 --> 23:39.416
<i>Your back really straight, and then
you push with your butt, right?</i>

23:39.516 --> 23:40.885
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:40.985 --> 23:43.888
<i>Push that out,
and you kind of lead with it.</i>

23:43.988 --> 23:46.423
<i>Try to go as deep as you can, okay?</i>

23:46.523 --> 23:50.260
<i>I assembled my own personal dream team.</i>

23:54.398 --> 23:55.599
<i>You can do better.</i>

23:55.699 --> 24:00.137
<i>Your back really straight, and then
you push with your butt, all right?</i>

24:00.237 --> 24:01.505
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:01.605 --> 24:04.541
<i>Push that out,
and you kind of lead with it.</i>

24:04.641 --> 24:07.694
<i>Try to go as deep as you can, okay?</i>

24:32.837 --> 24:37.516
Hey, hey. Hey, fella.

24:39.476 --> 24:42.079
Hey. Hello, hello.

24:42.179 --> 24:45.149
Hey, chubby, chubby.

24:45.249 --> 24:48.052
Hi, name's chubby.

24:48.152 --> 24:52.623
My mom's chubby. My dad's chubby.
Even my dog's chubby.

25:37.301 --> 25:39.804
<i>Of course, it hurts.
It's supposed to hurt.</i>

25:39.904 --> 25:42.106
<i>You fool yourself if you think
you conquer pain.</i>

25:42.206 --> 25:44.775
<i>You cannot conquer pain. Pain is key.</i>

25:44.875 --> 25:48.345
<i>You cannot work against it.
You must work with it.</i>

25:48.445 --> 25:50.714
When you come up,
you come up to that front heel.

25:50.814 --> 25:54.018
All that work is in that front heel.

25:54.751 --> 25:57.287
Drop down into it.

25:58.822 --> 26:00.824
Wait...

26:01.959 --> 26:04.128
What?

26:04.228 --> 26:05.782
What?

26:05.882 --> 26:09.400
Okay, I'm sorry. That was...
it was just a... it was a visual thing.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.503
No shit, it's a visual.
It's... I look ridiculous.

26:12.603 --> 26:14.238
That's why we're doing
this shit in private.

26:14.338 --> 26:17.474
It's not ridiculous.
You're learning something new.

26:17.774 --> 26:20.511
All right, and push up.
Take a breath if you need it, okay?

26:20.611 --> 26:22.613
Yeah.

26:24.515 --> 26:27.384
Good. Okay.

26:33.524 --> 26:37.828
Monty Python. Ministry of Silly Walks.

26:37.928 --> 26:41.132
You don't know that?
Do you know who Monty Python is?

26:41.232 --> 26:44.620
You've never heard of Monty...
You don't know who they are?

26:44.720 --> 26:48.105
John Cleese? Shit, I'm old.

26:48.205 --> 26:52.344
You're not old.
You're just lazy. Let's go.

26:53.544 --> 26:56.281
- Well, nice work today.
- Thanks.

26:56.381 --> 27:00.184
I meant to say,
I enjoyed your photography again.

27:02.085 --> 27:06.456
You have... you have no idea what
I'm talking about. That's awesome.

27:08.158 --> 27:10.460
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.263
Yeah. Do you want to come in
and smoke some time?

27:13.363 --> 27:16.166
It doesn't have to be now.
I mean, some time.

27:18.335 --> 27:22.306
Well, you know, it's not very... it's not
very good for you. It's not healthy.

27:22.406 --> 27:27.177
Yeah, we may disagree
on the definition of health.

27:28.612 --> 27:32.216
Well, I have a... I have a client now,
but I appreciate the offer.

27:32.316 --> 27:33.017
Yeah.

27:33.117 --> 27:34.355
- Good night.
- Good night.

27:34.455 --> 27:37.254
But when my boyfriend starts
getting calls from her boyfriend,

27:37.354 --> 27:40.691
saying, "what the fuck, yo?"
Like, then it's my business, you know?

27:40.791 --> 27:43.227
Right. Well, they just got
to take some responsibility.

27:43.327 --> 27:46.663
Exactly. I think I just did 20.

27:46.763 --> 27:48.732
I counted 16.

27:48.832 --> 27:52.202
I was paying attention.
I think it was 20.

27:52.302 --> 27:55.906
Okay, I'm gonna put 16 down in here
'cause that's what I counted,

27:56.006 --> 27:59.109
but if you want to move on,
we can move on.

27:59.709 --> 28:02.167
Yeah. Thank you.

28:07.251 --> 28:10.220
Am I your most out-of-shape client?

28:11.087 --> 28:13.023
No.

28:13.123 --> 28:15.458
No, definitely not.

28:16.793 --> 28:20.831
You know what, Danny?
Your questionable diet aside,

28:20.931 --> 28:23.767
you actually, like, put in an effort
into some of the workouts.

28:23.867 --> 28:27.671
I mean, some of these people, I don't even
know why they waste their money.

28:28.038 --> 28:32.309
They... they waste it 'cause
they have it. That's why I waste it.

28:32.610 --> 28:37.481
I've met a lot of rich people, okay,
and you have got your own sense of style.

28:37.581 --> 28:41.017
- Just no frills at all.
- You know, I tell you, it's like...

28:41.117 --> 28:43.139
Thank you.

28:48.025 --> 28:53.731
It's a rental, so it's temporary. I don't
know how long I'm gonna stay in town.

28:54.298 --> 28:56.533
I mean, like, what are you,

28:56.633 --> 29:02.639
some, like, globetrotting,
trust-fund kid?

29:03.407 --> 29:05.909
What? No. Fuck, no.

29:06.009 --> 29:09.513
You want something to drink?
You want water? You want a beer?

29:09.613 --> 29:12.282
You want a protein shake
or whatever you drink?

29:12.382 --> 29:16.420
- I'll take a water, thanks.
- Okay.

29:16.520 --> 29:20.290
Did you invent a website,
something like that?

29:20.390 --> 29:23.460
Let's have whiskey.
You want to have a shot?

29:23.560 --> 29:25.696
- Whiskey?
- Like, come on. Enough control.

29:25.796 --> 29:28.898
- I don't know about...
- Enough controlling our descent.

29:28.998 --> 29:31.001
Yeah, yeah. You just...
just a little bit, I think.

29:31.101 --> 29:33.303
A little bit?

29:35.505 --> 29:41.369
I got divorced about...
God, I don't know.

29:41.469 --> 29:46.250
- A half a year ago?
- Your wife invented a website, then?

29:46.350 --> 29:51.755
No, she didn't invent shit. She was...
she's pretty smart. I respect her.

29:51.855 --> 29:54.760
- You want ice?
- Yeah, I'll take some ice, thank you.

29:54.860 --> 29:58.829
But I... she's...
That's not what happened.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.031
Thanks.

30:01.131 --> 30:04.053
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:05.168 --> 30:08.273
Within 24 hours of...

30:08.373 --> 30:11.975
the ink drying on the divorce,
I find out my mother's dead.

30:12.075 --> 30:14.979
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. You didn't kill her.

30:15.079 --> 30:17.981
Hadn't talked to her for 16, 17 years.

30:18.081 --> 30:20.417
You know, we didn't leave off
on a good place,

30:20.517 --> 30:23.086
and I knew she lived in Texas.

30:23.186 --> 30:25.622
I knew she married a rich guy.
I didn't realize how rich.

30:25.722 --> 30:28.392
I didn't realize he'd already died.

30:28.492 --> 30:31.862
I never thought
she'd put me in her will.

30:32.362 --> 30:36.132
The thing is, if she had died
one week earlier,

30:36.232 --> 30:39.503
my ex-wife would be rich now,
and I feel bad about that,

30:39.603 --> 30:44.007
because I think she really
would've enjoyed being rich.

30:44.107 --> 30:47.297
Yeah, I mean, some girls
are into that...

30:47.797 --> 30:49.788
thing.

30:58.588 --> 31:00.324
Do you want to watch TV?

31:00.424 --> 31:03.060
<i>People ask me all the time
about the progress we've made</i>

31:03.160 --> 31:05.329
<i>treating mental illness
in this country...</i>

31:05.429 --> 31:08.424
- Are you married?
- Me?

31:08.524 --> 31:10.534
No way. You see a ring on this finger?

31:10.634 --> 31:13.270
<i>...and when I talk to the medical
professionals in the field.</i>

31:13.370 --> 31:16.473
<i>They'll tell you we've made
phenomenal progress.</i>

31:16.840 --> 31:18.308
A boyfriend?

31:18.408 --> 31:23.046
I've been sleeping with someone,
or I was sleeping with someone.

31:23.146 --> 31:25.988
I don't know
if that's happening anymore.

31:27.017 --> 31:28.652
<i>And, in fact, it may be worse.</i>

31:28.752 --> 31:32.823
<i>Yeah, we sought treatment, and it's...</i>

31:32.923 --> 31:37.971
<i>He was in and out
of institutions for years, and...</i>

31:38.071 --> 31:41.515
<i>I've lost count
of how many places we went...</i>

31:41.615 --> 31:44.270
<i>we went to, and...</i>

31:44.870 --> 31:47.938
<i>we all knew he was in danger.</i>

31:48.038 --> 31:50.840
<i>We knew it was a danger.</i>

31:53.610 --> 31:58.582
<i>On the morning of November 3rd,
Billy boarded a bus headed to Madison,</i>

31:58.682 --> 32:02.786
<i>carrying three handguns
all legally purchased.</i>

32:02.886 --> 32:06.590
<i>The last time he had spoken to Susan
had been four days earlier.</i>

32:06.690 --> 32:08.558
<i>He told her he was going back.</i>

32:08.658 --> 32:11.428
- Slow down. No disrobing, okay?
- Okay.

32:11.728 --> 32:15.599
I know it's on the high end
of your scale,

32:15.699 --> 32:19.870
you know, size-wise and price-wise,
but I just thought you'd want to see it.

32:19.970 --> 32:22.939
I mean, it could be amazing, right?
You could get so much equipment in here.

32:23.039 --> 32:27.310
Not that it's about competing
with the franchise gyms.

32:28.144 --> 32:32.349
Imagine having a juice bar there, right,
with a nutritionist on staff.

32:32.449 --> 32:36.653
You know, in a place like this, I could
take the whole Power 4 Life philosophy

32:36.753 --> 32:39.156
and actualize it.

32:42.225 --> 32:46.363
We could have a heart center, we could
have a mind center, have a spirit center.

32:46.463 --> 32:51.201
We could make that area like a private area
and have a licensed therapist on staff.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.770
We could have meditation classes.

32:53.870 --> 32:56.773
I mean, it's crazy,
and if it didn't take off really quickly,

32:56.873 --> 33:00.243
you'd probably see me down
at 24-Hour Fitness begging for a job.

33:00.343 --> 33:04.948
Hey, hey, the first thing
you told me when we met

33:05.048 --> 33:07.217
was that you were looking to grow.

33:07.317 --> 33:12.089
So the real question is,
how much do you want to grow?

33:40.350 --> 33:41.871
You do CrossFit, don't you?

33:41.971 --> 33:46.274
Six days a week, and sometimes
I try and squeeze in yoga

33:46.374 --> 33:49.059
- and Pilates if I can.
- And who do you train with?

33:49.159 --> 33:51.896
Do you know Dominic
and Sarah at South Side?

33:51.996 --> 33:52.929
They're fantastic.

33:53.029 --> 33:57.701
Yeah, but if you were in this location,
I'd have to start coming here.

33:57.801 --> 34:01.071
Super convenient for me.
I just live a few blocks away.

34:01.171 --> 34:03.840
Really? There's so many
great restaurants around here.

34:03.940 --> 34:08.545
Yeah, I mean, not that I can go
to any of them since I've gone paleo.

34:08.645 --> 34:11.681
I know a really great beef-ball place
if you want a recommendation.

34:11.781 --> 34:13.181
Absolutely.

34:13.282 --> 34:15.918
Let me know when you're free,
and we'll get it on the calendar.

34:16.018 --> 34:18.813
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

34:27.362 --> 34:31.467
Hey, if I... go to the store,
do you want me to pick you up anything?

34:31.568 --> 34:33.851
Hello?

34:36.205 --> 34:37.841
Tre... Trevor?

34:37.940 --> 34:41.277
Yeah, your door was open.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

34:41.377 --> 34:44.411
- Hi, Thea.
- Hey.

34:44.512 --> 34:48.681
I could have texted, but I didn't have
the app that can deliver soup.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.960
Thea, Trevor brought soup.
Would you like some soup or...

34:51.060 --> 34:55.158
- No, I'm okay, thanks.
- I rescheduled most of my clients.

34:55.257 --> 34:57.593
You know, I'm sick,
but everything is cool.

34:57.693 --> 34:59.662
Okay.

35:00.064 --> 35:04.726
You look like you're in good healing hands.
I'll just leave this for you, and...

35:04.826 --> 35:08.304
if you need to cancel tomorrow,
let me know, and I'll sort that out.

35:08.404 --> 35:12.472
Health first? Okay, see you ladies.

35:14.344 --> 35:19.683
- Was this business or personal, Trevor?
- I didn't mean to freak you out.

35:41.838 --> 35:45.242
- All right, good night.
- Night.

36:25.849 --> 36:29.085
Hey, I... I didn't know
if you did evening sessions.

36:29.185 --> 36:32.755
I can, but not if the client
isn't in appropriate workout clothes.

36:32.855 --> 36:35.325
Well, I mean, hey.

36:35.425 --> 36:38.928
The pay is the same either way, right?
Come on. Come in.

36:39.028 --> 36:43.133
Listen, Danny. We need to talk.

36:43.833 --> 36:47.470
Yeah, no, we absolutely need to talk.
That's why I want you to come inside.

36:47.570 --> 36:49.972
No... but listen, I just...

36:50.072 --> 36:53.701
I need to figure out if we can continue
a professional relationship here...

36:53.801 --> 36:55.345
- Come on inside. Come in the house.
- And if we can't...

36:57.747 --> 36:59.452
Come on. I want to show you something.

37:11.394 --> 37:13.930
I hired these guys.

37:14.030 --> 37:16.066
Sorry?

37:26.209 --> 37:28.278
Kat.

37:28.678 --> 37:31.715
Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on.

37:41.629 --> 37:43.894
Chef Paul, that looks amazing.

37:43.994 --> 37:45.863
- You're a wizard.
- Thank you.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.564
Look at that. Look at that salad.

37:48.664 --> 37:50.834
Look at that. This is...

37:50.934 --> 37:54.437
I hope you brought an appetite and that
you didn't eat already because...

37:54.537 --> 37:58.942
- I had a Power Bar on the way over.
- You had a Power Bar... great, that's...

37:59.042 --> 38:01.811
Well, that's all right,
but this is some gourmet stuff.

38:01.911 --> 38:06.683
This is, like... he's...
he's a celebrity, that guy.

38:21.197 --> 38:22.866
Kat!

38:24.400 --> 38:26.236
Keep playing.

38:26.336 --> 38:28.404
Kat, where are you going?
This is good food. This is...

38:28.504 --> 38:30.440
How fucking stupid are you?

38:31.207 --> 38:33.911
Hey, Kat. Kat. Kat!

38:39.449 --> 38:41.651
You want to date me?

38:41.751 --> 38:45.898
- For 100 bucks an hour?
- No. I mean, yes, I want to date you.

38:45.998 --> 38:47.524
Why, because you thought
we liked each other?

38:47.624 --> 38:49.826
Yeah. Well, you know.

38:49.926 --> 38:53.584
Danny, I'm in the service industry,
okay? That is my job.

38:53.684 --> 38:55.532
You know what?
That's not what this shit is about.

38:55.632 --> 39:01.104
This is about you insecure fucks
not trusting anything you can't buy.

39:01.204 --> 39:04.641
My god. You have got to be
the worst rich guy ever.

39:05.141 --> 39:08.742
You don't know what to do with your money.
Boo-fucking-hoo, Danny.

39:08.842 --> 39:11.514
- Give it to charity.
- Fine, I can do that. I'll do that.

39:11.614 --> 39:15.385
Give it to cancer research, and then
go get cancer for all I give a fuck!

39:15.485 --> 39:17.821
God damn.

39:18.321 --> 39:20.824
I'm sorry, Danny. Was that harsh?

39:20.924 --> 39:25.495
Maybe I'm not your dream girl, okay? Maybe
we have absolutely nothing in common.

39:25.595 --> 39:28.231
I had a lot in common
with my ex-wife, so I don't know.

39:28.331 --> 39:31.062
Maybe I don't need to do that again.

39:31.768 --> 39:33.637
You know, I didn't know
you were this angry.

39:33.737 --> 39:36.139
Well, I am!

39:37.740 --> 39:41.478
It's not making me
any less attracted to you.

40:24.314 --> 40:28.391
- How do they know I'm sexy?
- They've seen your picture on my Facebook.

40:28.491 --> 40:30.624
- They're watching me on Facebook?
- Of course.

40:30.724 --> 40:33.596
You remember those pictures
I was taking almost every day?

40:33.696 --> 40:36.966
The ones with my shirt off?
All right, see you, Charles.

40:37.066 --> 40:39.402
Hey, I...

40:41.871 --> 40:43.283
Why do I have a message from Danny Ross

40:43.383 --> 40:46.241
telling me that he's stopping
payment on his check?

40:46.341 --> 40:49.112
Okay, tell me you deposited it,
that it's in the bank?

40:49.212 --> 40:51.344
That's not... That's beside the point.

40:51.444 --> 40:55.951
Well, look, I was about to tell you
that we had some personal issues.

40:56.051 --> 41:00.089
Just some inappropriate behavior,
nothing illegal or scary,

41:00.189 --> 41:03.326
but I don't think that
I should go over there again.

41:05.194 --> 41:07.330
You should hire somebody
to do this part for you.

41:07.430 --> 41:11.167
Don't make fun of me, Kat.
I'm good with business.

41:16.506 --> 41:18.707
This is... it's $25,000.

41:18.807 --> 41:22.378
Yeah, he wanted to pay for two years
in advance, three sessions a week.

41:22.478 --> 41:26.115
- I talked him down a bit but not much.
- Did he hit on you or something?

41:28.717 --> 41:32.722
- Right, and how did you handle that?
- Poorly, but he crossed the line, Trevor,

41:32.872 --> 41:36.793
and you know I can't handle it
when the line is crossed.

41:36.893 --> 41:39.896
What, did he use inappropriate language
or try and touch you or...

41:39.996 --> 41:45.768
No, I mean, yes, he hired, like,
a jazz band to sing to me.

41:45.868 --> 41:48.905
Jazz? What the fuck?

41:49.005 --> 41:53.076
Jazz, maybe love songs or ballads.
I'm not... I don't know what it was,

41:53.176 --> 41:56.980
but it was inappropriate, and I just...
I don't think we need him as a client,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.966
and I'm sorry that you didn't have
your shit together to deposit this

42:00.066 --> 42:02.051
when I gave it to you.

42:02.151 --> 42:07.357
No, I'm... I mean, I...
I am genuinely sorry.

42:07.457 --> 42:09.059
I'm calling him.

42:15.731 --> 42:18.234
Hey, I'm in a movie.

42:18.334 --> 42:21.637
<i>Danny, can you hear me?
It's Trevor Manning from Power 4 Life.</i>

42:21.737 --> 42:25.027
<i>Listen, mate, I got your message, and...</i>

42:25.127 --> 42:28.211
<i>I've just been talking to Kat
here in my office.</i>

42:28.311 --> 42:29.666
Is she there now? Put her on.

42:29.766 --> 42:32.448
I'm gonna need you to keep
your distance from Kat, okay?

42:32.548 --> 42:36.486
I don't think there's any need to bring in
any legal authorities at this time,

42:36.586 --> 42:41.891
but if you try to contact her, just to say
that the law won't be your only problem.

42:41.991 --> 42:45.528
- Are you threatening him?
- Are you threatening me?

42:45.628 --> 42:48.197
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

42:48.497 --> 42:54.036
Well, maybe you'll have a legal problem,
dick nose. I have an amazing lawyer.

42:56.139 --> 42:58.611
Hey, I'm at a movie, man. Bye.

43:04.246 --> 43:06.148
Raymond!

43:06.248 --> 43:08.918
Raymond, get in here!

43:09.018 --> 43:11.120
Raymond!

43:11.220 --> 43:14.924
Our territory is not
being threatened, brother.

43:32.842 --> 43:35.812
"Why are you yelling at me, Dada?

43:36.379 --> 43:39.449
I'm just following my instincts."

44:00.035 --> 44:02.672
You told me you wanted
to learn how to take a punch.

44:02.772 --> 44:05.088
Well, you think you're ready?

44:05.674 --> 44:08.644
Listen, when I send a young woman
over to your house,

44:08.744 --> 44:13.583
there is an implicit trust that you know
how to behave like an adult, right?

44:13.683 --> 44:16.519
When you break that trust...

44:16.619 --> 44:19.689
man, you're opening the gates of hell,

44:19.789 --> 44:23.793
and this is not about the check,
by the way, all right?

44:27.496 --> 44:31.000
You know, Kat was already over here
pushing me all around my own house,

44:31.100 --> 44:36.239
so the... you know, the hellhounds
or whatever have already been released.

44:36.339 --> 44:37.307
- Good.
- You missed it.

44:37.407 --> 44:40.676
Yeah, good, good. Well, I back her 100%.

44:40.776 --> 44:44.780
Now, listen, I'm just gonna
say this politely, okay?

44:44.880 --> 44:49.752
You can... you can hire as many lawyers
as you like to come after me.

44:50.552 --> 44:53.222
But really, you don't have a leg
to stand on, do you?

44:53.322 --> 44:56.893
I don't... I probably deserved it,
but like I told her,

44:56.993 --> 45:01.430
her whole anger thing just...
turned me on, all right? It was hot.

45:01.530 --> 45:04.700
Why don't you do me a favor? Why don't you
do me a favor and just hit me?

45:04.800 --> 45:06.702
- Why don't you hit me first?
- You want hit?

45:06.802 --> 45:09.872
Yeah, why don't you hit me?
Go on, punch me.

45:09.972 --> 45:12.174
Like what? Like... like...

45:12.274 --> 45:15.878
You hired a jazz combo to sing to her!

45:16.179 --> 45:18.214
Yeah.

45:20.749 --> 45:24.720
God. You know...
I've heard of runner's high,

45:24.820 --> 45:29.959
but I didn't realize there's
an out-of-your-mind high.

45:30.059 --> 45:31.627
This is crazy.

45:31.727 --> 45:34.163
What are you doing?

45:42.204 --> 45:45.107
I'm gonna let you go, okay?

45:45.474 --> 45:47.510
- Okay.
- All right.

45:47.610 --> 45:50.479
I'm looking forward to it.

45:55.951 --> 45:59.689
I'm done, man. You know, I don't want
to be a rageaholic muscle man, anyway.

45:59.789 --> 46:03.459
You guys can keep it.
I'm gonna stick with pudgy and mellow.

46:03.559 --> 46:05.753
Yeah, whatever.

46:06.395 --> 46:09.398
You want me to at least pay
for the sessions I already took?

46:09.498 --> 46:13.102
Like I said, it's not
about the money, brother.

46:29.652 --> 46:32.254
"It's not about..."

46:34.957 --> 46:36.827
"It's not about the money, brother"

47:02.785 --> 47:05.888
Hey... look, I...

47:05.988 --> 47:08.591
I just want to say that I'm...

47:08.691 --> 47:13.429
I don't... I don't need you to give up
on training because of any of this.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.702
Hey... you know, I got a bunch of...

47:19.802 --> 47:24.006
exercise equipment here
that... I'm not gonna use.

47:24.106 --> 47:27.296
- Do you want to take some of it?
- No, that's what I'm saying.

47:27.396 --> 47:32.357
I'm sure this whole experience
has soured you on us, but...

47:32.757 --> 47:36.786
you know, and just because
Power 4 Life wasn't the right fit for you

47:36.886 --> 47:39.054
in helping you achieve your goals

47:39.154 --> 47:43.092
doesn't mean you should use that
as an excuse to, you know,

47:43.192 --> 47:45.995
to give up on those goals.

47:59.675 --> 48:03.479
Hey, you know, I've been
watching your videos on YouTube.

48:04.413 --> 48:08.050
Yeah. And you make it seem like
you believe all this shit, you know.

48:08.150 --> 48:10.419
Of course, I do.

48:11.854 --> 48:13.890
Yeah.

48:15.458 --> 48:17.960
You smoke weed?

48:19.462 --> 48:21.297
No.

48:29.165 --> 48:31.040
So, I'd want to have
a partition here, right,

48:31.140 --> 48:33.844
but not a full sort of
floor-to-ceiling wall, you know.

48:33.944 --> 48:36.712
I want to feel like the space
has flow, you know,

48:36.812 --> 48:38.852
all the way from one end to the other.

48:38.952 --> 48:41.767
Having said that, I'm aware
that not everyone in there

48:41.867 --> 48:44.720
doing a class wants to feel like
they're doing it to an audience,

48:44.820 --> 48:47.422
so, you know, I just think
we'd have to be really mindful

48:47.522 --> 48:52.695
of how we position our...
feng shui, the equipment.

48:52.795 --> 48:55.965
You know, it's about respect,
good taste.

48:56.065 --> 48:59.068
Sort of being in line with the space.

48:59.168 --> 49:02.237
I mean, this place is...
is bloody enormous,

49:02.337 --> 49:06.375
but I kind of want it to feel even bigger
once everything's in here, you know?

49:07.441 --> 49:10.412
Am I leaving anything out?
No, that's it.

49:13.816 --> 49:17.986
Yeah, it's good, man.
Well, you know, me and him'll talk.

49:18.086 --> 49:18.954
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:19.054 --> 49:21.757
- Great. Great, great, great.
- Looks good, man. Looks good.

49:21.857 --> 49:25.098
- Thanks, Danny. I appreciate it, mate.
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.

49:25.198 --> 49:26.860
Mandy, you are a legend

49:26.960 --> 49:29.417
for getting us in here at such short
notice. I really appreciate it.

49:29.517 --> 49:32.034
We'll just have to say
that you owe me that dinner.

49:32.134 --> 49:34.604
Shit. I already owe you that.
How about this weekend?

49:42.077 --> 49:46.282
You know, I was thinking
of taking a little break after today.

49:46.382 --> 49:48.883
Break? For how long?

49:49.683 --> 49:51.880
Forever.

49:51.980 --> 49:56.024
What? But... Rick,
you're one of the good guys.

49:56.124 --> 50:01.300
Really? 'Cause I'm still fat,
and that still hurts my nuts.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.766
We know that you
can be hard on yourself, okay?

50:03.866 --> 50:05.768
But that just means
that you're being honest.

50:05.868 --> 50:08.338
- You have made progress.
- I know I'm honest, and honestly,

50:08.438 --> 50:11.407
I don't care as much about...

50:11.507 --> 50:13.442
losing the weight as I thought I would,

50:13.542 --> 50:18.681
and my wife doesn't really care much
about it, so... probably just gonna...

50:18.781 --> 50:22.195
Look, Rick, I know you're busy, okay,
and I know it's not cheap,

50:22.295 --> 50:26.355
and if finances are tight, I can talk
to my boss about cutting a deal for you.

50:26.455 --> 50:30.106
- He knows you're a good client of mine.
- No, it isn't that. I'm just quitting.

50:32.995 --> 50:35.831
Fuck you! You're not a quitter.

50:36.983 --> 50:39.054
Shit.

50:39.154 --> 50:42.337
I mean, it had to end some time, yeah?

50:42.437 --> 50:44.145
I mean...

50:44.245 --> 50:47.643
you're not gonna be a trainer
for the rest of your life.

50:47.743 --> 50:49.847
I just think you're really cool.
I really do, Kat,

50:49.947 --> 50:53.848
and I'd love you to still come
to the birthday party and everything.

50:53.948 --> 50:57.119
Yeah, fine. I'll come
to the stupid birthday party.

50:57.219 --> 51:01.590
- You're a great trainer. You're top notch.
- You're good, too, I guess.

51:01.690 --> 51:02.582
Kat.

51:11.633 --> 51:13.669
Thanks.

51:19.341 --> 51:24.513
I mean, you should...
consult your own counsel, but...

51:31.954 --> 51:34.924
- And you... so this is fairly standard?
- Sign the fuck out of that thing.

51:35.024 --> 51:37.264
Sign it, sign it, sign it.

51:49.638 --> 51:52.298
- Hey. I'm in your house.
- Hey.

51:52.398 --> 51:56.445
I might have used up the rest
of your kale and some other stuff.

52:03.068 --> 52:04.820
I...

52:04.920 --> 52:08.523
I've got some good news
and, well, not bad news,

52:08.623 --> 52:12.327
but... there's been
some business developments.

52:12.427 --> 52:15.215
Well, look, I don't really care
about business developments.

52:15.315 --> 52:18.767
That's what I needed to tell you.

52:19.301 --> 52:21.337
I quit.

52:36.018 --> 52:38.554
That's not erotic for me.

52:38.654 --> 52:41.523
It's not supposed to be.

52:41.623 --> 52:44.253
This is my house, remember?

52:44.827 --> 52:49.365
I thought you would be relieved. Now you
don't have to figure out how to fire me.

52:49.465 --> 52:51.967
I don't want to fire you.

52:55.020 --> 52:59.775
I probably should have fired you once
upon a time, but I don't want to fire you.

53:06.815 --> 53:09.340
I just ran over here
from Rick Jackson's house

53:09.440 --> 53:14.824
because I realized that I was quitting,
and by the time I got here, I just...

53:14.924 --> 53:17.093
I felt so much better.

53:17.593 --> 53:20.195
I don't want to make you
miserable, Trevor.

53:20.295 --> 53:22.731
You don't make me miserable.

53:22.831 --> 53:26.869
I just feel like I need a real job
or a real boyfriend,

53:26.969 --> 53:30.390
or at least to try those things
and see if I like them.

53:30.490 --> 53:33.285
Absolutely, and if they're your goals,
then you've got to go for it,

53:33.385 --> 53:36.645
and I'm not gonna stand in your way.

53:37.712 --> 53:40.549
Do you want to make out?

53:41.516 --> 53:43.585
The business is expanding, all right?

53:43.685 --> 53:47.055
I put it out there into the world that
I was ready to take it to the next level,

53:47.155 --> 53:50.893
and this... and it's coming back
to me now, you know?

53:52.494 --> 53:55.229
Well, all right.

53:56.319 --> 54:00.002
Cool. Do you want to make out?

54:01.670 --> 54:03.519
Look, I just thought it'd be fun.
You're not my boss anymore,

54:03.619 --> 54:08.043
and we don't have to worry
about all the working thing.

54:09.645 --> 54:13.681
I... actually happen
to very much like you, okay?

54:13.781 --> 54:16.719
Yeah, laugh, Kat.
That's really gonna be helpful.

54:16.819 --> 54:18.987
Listen, you're 29, okay?

54:19.087 --> 54:22.224
This was never gonna be a serious thing
for you, was it? And it shouldn't be.

54:22.324 --> 54:25.995
A couple of fit, sweaty people who work
together. This thing happens all the time.

54:26.095 --> 54:30.465
Occupational hazard, but... you know,
that's fine. I can forgive myself for it.

54:30.565 --> 54:32.969
- Right, no regrets?
- Well, I don't have regrets, okay?

54:33.069 --> 54:35.337
Well, you should have regrets
'cause regrets are a real thing.

54:35.437 --> 54:38.088
Because I care for you... I...

54:38.188 --> 54:41.280
Like I said, look...

54:42.044 --> 54:46.281
I can only move forward with my life just
like you can only move forward with yours.

54:46.381 --> 54:50.085
And my hope is that you can fulfill
some of your dreams

54:50.185 --> 54:53.755
just like... while I'm fulfilling mine.

54:53.855 --> 54:56.291
But the thing is, if you're walking
out that door right now,

54:56.391 --> 55:00.685
I can't imagine seeing you again.

55:02.898 --> 55:06.669
Well, if you put it that way, I...

55:06.769 --> 55:09.304
I won't waste any more of your time.

55:09.404 --> 55:11.340
Kat.

55:11.440 --> 55:15.010
- We're not communicating properly.
- Well, luckily, we don't have to.

55:15.110 --> 55:17.646
Thanks for the gig.

55:20.415 --> 55:22.985
Okay, bye.

55:34.162 --> 55:36.232
Danny.

55:36.832 --> 55:39.367
I don't know, man.

55:39.901 --> 55:44.139
So... how's it gonna look,
you coming to another gym like this?

55:44.239 --> 55:46.408
Different tools
for different jobs, you know?

55:46.508 --> 55:50.212
You know when we met, and you said to me
you wanted to learn how to take a punch?

55:50.312 --> 55:53.681
I thought to myself,
"Who the fuck is this guy," all right?

55:53.781 --> 55:57.886
What I should have been thinking
to myself was, "How can I help this guy?"

55:58.053 --> 56:02.457
So, if we flip this "take a punch" thing,
and say what you're really after

56:02.557 --> 56:05.093
is, you want to build strength,
you want to get strong.

56:05.193 --> 56:09.064
That's a goal worth going for.
That's a goal worth attaining, yeah?

56:09.164 --> 56:10.999
Yeah.

56:11.947 --> 56:13.569
I guess so, yeah.

56:13.669 --> 56:16.438
Come on, you'll learn to love it.
You'll learn to love it.

56:16.538 --> 56:19.140
You've seen Rocky, right?

56:20.175 --> 56:22.578
Yeah. Like 200 times.

56:22.678 --> 56:25.281
It's half the battle, man.
It's half the battle.

56:25.381 --> 56:30.185
I will make a warrior out of you in no time.
I'm just gonna do one more of these.

56:36.058 --> 56:38.108
Good.

56:40.762 --> 56:42.204
Don't forget to breathe.

56:54.777 --> 56:57.879
It's actually clean on the inside.
That's all you need to worry about.

56:57.979 --> 57:02.518
Yes, because what you put inside
affects what comes out.

57:22.104 --> 57:23.506
Some more.

57:33.415 --> 57:36.044
- Great!
- Well?

57:36.144 --> 57:39.721
- I love it!
- I think it looks pretty good, and...

58:03.245 --> 58:06.267
You want to be careful
not to roll too much.

58:08.583 --> 58:10.358
Feel yourself. Feel your shoulders.

59:24.493 --> 59:27.562
Yeah, just... you know.

59:27.662 --> 59:29.831
- All right.
- Okay.

59:30.278 --> 59:34.168
- Just... you're great. Okay.
- All right.

59:34.268 --> 59:36.805
Good now. Push it up. Push it up.

59:36.905 --> 59:40.447
Up, up, up, up, up. Yeah.

59:41.476 --> 59:45.280
Beautiful. That's it.

59:45.780 --> 59:47.559
Yes!

59:47.659 --> 59:50.919
Nice. Two good ones, one shitty one,

59:51.019 --> 59:54.723
and you started at zero, so if you
were to stop smoking and drinking

59:54.823 --> 59:58.326
and eating so much shit,
you would be unstoppable.

01:00:00.762 --> 01:00:01.930
Come here, girl.

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:04.699
Yeah, I just think, you know,
if you want to relieve loneliness,

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:06.802
the dog is your only option.

01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:09.972
Who says I'm lonely?

01:00:10.072 --> 01:00:12.407
You can put your shirt back on.

01:00:12.507 --> 01:00:16.044
Yeah, you drank it all,
you fuckin' degenerate.

01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:18.989
Where the fuck is that?

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.386
Dude.

01:00:24.486 --> 01:00:26.522
Sorry.

01:00:29.624 --> 01:00:33.329
Hey, you know, we've just employed
this amazing yogi.

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:35.564
If you're interested,
I can get you privates.

01:00:35.664 --> 01:00:38.333
Get me what?

01:00:38.433 --> 01:00:41.169
Privates, private sessions.

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:44.372
You know you're supposed to have
your knees apart when you do that, right?

01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:48.610
Kat showed me this. She said
this was good for stress relief.

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.512
Hey, listen.
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:00:50.612 --> 01:00:53.581
You want to ride out to West Texas with me?
I'm gonna go and meet Grigory Volkov.

01:00:53.681 --> 01:00:56.751
You know, he's in from New York.
He's this amazing kettle bell master.

01:00:56.851 --> 01:01:00.389
- I'm gonna be in New York visiting my ex-wife.
- He's on some holiday or something.

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:02.790
You're what?
You're gonna visit your wife?

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:06.661
- My ex-wife.
- Your ex-wife, right. How come?

01:01:06.761 --> 01:01:09.497
I think I'm gonna actually try
to get back together with her.

01:01:09.597 --> 01:01:14.036
You don't think that's kind of going
backwards or anything, do you? I mean...

01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:19.141
You know, I'm just... asking as your friend
and as your trainer and stuff.

01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:21.910
I mean... I mean, sure, yeah.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.279
Go, go sweep her off her feet
if that's what you feel,

01:01:24.379 --> 01:01:28.250
- but as long as you're moving forwards.
- I'm just going to these events

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:32.716
where all these rich women go
down here, and...

01:01:32.816 --> 01:01:36.825
I just can't... my whole thing
doesn't work with... I can't...

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:40.762
You know, I'm sure Christine
and I were fucked up,

01:01:40.862 --> 01:01:42.898
but, you know, we made sense.

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:47.335
No, no, man.
Listen to what you're saying.

01:01:47.435 --> 01:01:51.406
"Maybe I should go back to something
fucked up"? That's fucking stupid.

01:01:51.506 --> 01:01:55.478
- I'm gonna take love advice from this guy.
- You're fucked up.

01:01:57.745 --> 01:02:03.919
Man, the accumulated knowledge
on the subject of women in this room.

01:02:08.256 --> 01:02:10.689
Did Kat really tell you
to do that like that? Really?

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:12.895
It doesn't look right. I think your knees
are supposed to be apart.

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:16.231
- Have you talked to her?
- No, not since she quit.

01:02:16.331 --> 01:02:20.268
- I think she's gone back to Dallas.
- No, she's still in Austin.

01:02:20.368 --> 01:02:23.171
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I Google her a lot.

01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:26.641
You Google her a lot.

01:02:30.662 --> 01:02:32.681
Kat.

01:02:34.488 --> 01:02:36.952
Okay, that's my cue.

01:02:37.252 --> 01:02:39.721
You're not driving anywhere, are you?

01:02:39.821 --> 01:02:43.091
- Tell him not to drive, man.
- Yeah, go lie down somewhere.

01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:46.527
No, no, no. I got a lot of friends
who are DUI lawyers.

01:02:46.627 --> 01:02:51.066
I'll give you... All right, I'll give you
$200 if you just go lie down somewhere.

01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:53.668
Pick a room.

01:02:55.136 --> 01:02:57.372
$300.

01:02:57.472 --> 01:02:59.774
- You got it.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:02.242
Just go lie down.

01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:06.291
Probably won't see you for a week.
Now, don't... don't...

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:11.150
- choke on your own vomit or some shit.
- I already choked on your farts!

01:03:11.519 --> 01:03:15.063
You know, when I think
about you and Kat,

01:03:16.063 --> 01:03:19.595
and, you know, I get it.
I mean, she's...

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:24.533
I mean, you know that you were just looking
for another woman to torture you, right?

01:03:24.633 --> 01:03:27.112
Like your ex-wife did,

01:03:27.712 --> 01:03:30.904
probably like your mother did. Look...

01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:34.709
do yourself a favor,
forget about the New York trip.

01:03:34.809 --> 01:03:37.211
Come out to West Texas with me.

01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:41.383
When we get back, you should just start
dating some gorgeous young lovely thing

01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:43.085
who's gonna be nice to you.

01:03:43.185 --> 01:03:45.987
I know that sounds
like a really weird idea, but...

01:03:46.087 --> 01:03:51.292
it'll be like a new workout routine, yeah?
You'll... you'll get used to it.

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:55.731
- You'll learn it, and you'll love it.
- You learn it. You love it.

01:03:57.198 --> 01:04:00.402
Kat was a non-starter,
I can guarantee you that.

01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:02.871
I figured that much out.

01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:06.139
Yeah, me, too.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.944
I was practically in love with her.

01:04:12.146 --> 01:04:15.116
In love... you loved her?

01:04:15.216 --> 01:04:19.454
I mean, we had this affair with each other
when she first started working for me.

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:24.158
It just didn't last very long, and it was
obviously highly unprofessional.

01:04:24.258 --> 01:04:25.623
And I wouldn't...

01:04:25.723 --> 01:04:29.483
I wouldn't let myself get into
that situation again, you know, but...

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:33.134
I'm really thankful
that I got to know her

01:04:33.234 --> 01:04:35.737
'cause I think she's a really...

01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:38.439
she's a really special chick, you know.

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.743
Fuck it all.

01:04:43.211 --> 01:04:46.214
I am also thankful
that she walked out of my life

01:04:46.314 --> 01:04:49.884
and my business before she burnt
the whole lot to the ground.

01:04:52.787 --> 01:04:58.294
What did Paul say? "The accumulated
knowledge of... the accumulated..."

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:02.263
"The accumulated knowledge
of women in the room."

01:05:02.363 --> 01:05:06.234
Yeah, the accumulated knowledge
of women in this room.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.756
Danny!

01:05:33.027 --> 01:05:34.177
Danny!

01:05:50.512 --> 01:05:51.813
Danny!

01:05:51.913 --> 01:05:54.067
Danny?

01:05:56.317 --> 01:05:59.788
Mate, what are you doing? You're drunk.

01:05:59.888 --> 01:06:02.456
You can't lift weights
when you're drunk.

01:06:02.556 --> 01:06:04.860
And you're stoned.
You'll bloody crack your skull open

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.563
if you dropped that on your head.
Why don't you just go to bed?

01:06:08.663 --> 01:06:12.234
- Just go and lie down.
- You said you loved her.

01:06:15.737 --> 01:06:17.839
Well...

01:06:17.939 --> 01:06:20.985
I'm sorry I never said anything.
I mean...

01:06:22.085 --> 01:06:25.079
it's weird, right?
The whole thing's weird,

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:29.784
and, you know,
like I say, unprofessional.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.589
Does she love you?

01:06:40.194 --> 01:06:42.652
I don't have anything in common with her

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:48.002
except depression and a couple
of abnormal kind of behaviors.

01:06:48.102 --> 01:06:51.357
Fuck that, man. You... you love someone,

01:06:51.457 --> 01:06:53.921
you don't throw it away
like it's nothing.

01:06:54.021 --> 01:06:57.991
Go and have great-looking kids with her

01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:01.879
who give 110%.

01:07:01.979 --> 01:07:05.720
You're my friend, Danny.
I don't know why I didn't say anything.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.627
No, I don't think so, not anymore.
Get out of my house.

01:07:11.826 --> 01:07:16.124
- Get out of your house?
- Get out of my house!

01:07:16.598 --> 01:07:19.467
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- What are you talking about?

01:07:19.567 --> 01:07:24.105
You're on my property. This is Texas.
I am allowed to shoot you.

01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:26.675
- I bought guns. They're around here.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

01:07:26.775 --> 01:07:29.511
- I'm going, all right?
- They're around here somewhere.

01:07:29.611 --> 01:07:31.713
Just don't pick those up again, okay?

01:07:31.813 --> 01:07:34.782
- Get the fuck...
- You're gonna injure yourself.

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:38.419
- Danny, seriously, you're drunk.
- Get out!

01:07:38.519 --> 01:07:42.585
- You're gonna do yourself an injury.
- Out!

01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:55.662
Hey, Danny, it's Trevor!

01:08:55.763 --> 01:09:00.841
I'm about to drive out West, mate.
I've got nice coffee in the car for you.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:03.705
Danny!

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:06.040
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:10.944
- Hey... can I talk to you for right now?
- Yeah, sure.

01:09:11.727 --> 01:09:14.515
Danny... Danny doesn't want to talk.

01:09:14.615 --> 01:09:18.819
Look, I know, it was a silly...
It was a silly kind of thing that...

01:09:18.919 --> 01:09:20.612
Yeah, let's go get some food. Come on.

01:09:20.955 --> 01:09:24.807
- Let's just let him sleep it off.
- He did sleep.

01:09:24.907 --> 01:09:29.831
I think, and he seemed crystal clear about
what he wanted to do, Trevor, I'm sorry.

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.191
We open up in a week.

01:09:31.291 --> 01:09:34.301
That shouldn't affect the launch
or anything, you know?

01:09:34.402 --> 01:09:37.270
Danny's gonna sell his half
of the company,

01:09:37.371 --> 01:09:41.919
and hopefully, it'll be somebody
who's a better fit, you know.

01:09:42.019 --> 01:09:45.563
Maybe somebody who's not such a stoner.

01:09:48.381 --> 01:09:50.011
I fucking knew something
like this would happen,

01:09:50.111 --> 01:09:53.086
and I reckon you knew it, as well,
and because of you,

01:09:53.185 --> 01:09:57.558
he's now gonna sell 50 fucking percent
of my business to anyone he wants.

01:09:57.658 --> 01:09:59.995
Probably one of my competitors.

01:10:03.264 --> 01:10:06.233
Well, I think that'd be synergy, dude.

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:09.637
No, that'd be a fucking fiasco, dude.

01:10:16.744 --> 01:10:19.147
I don't expect for you to understand,

01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:23.084
but I subscribe to a very particular
wellness philosophy, okay?

01:10:23.184 --> 01:10:26.754
Somebody who... somebody who comes
into that... that's not simpatico

01:10:26.854 --> 01:10:31.659
is gonna mean I've spent the last 10 years
of my life building a pile of shit.

01:10:32.193 --> 01:10:37.307
Look, man, you know,
I don't want to preach to you, but...

01:10:38.207 --> 01:10:41.468
business is unpredictable, you know.

01:10:42.203 --> 01:10:46.007
And not to throw you your own shit,
but, you got to be... you got to Li...

01:10:47.008 --> 01:10:49.877
you got to live forward, man.

01:11:23.811 --> 01:11:26.180
- Kat?
- <i>Hi, Trevor.</i>

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.015
Hi, how you going?

01:11:28.115 --> 01:11:31.319
<i>Good, I'm actually standing
outside your new place.</i>

01:11:31.419 --> 01:11:33.554
No way.

01:11:34.254 --> 01:11:39.128
- What do you think?
- <i>Well, it's... it's optimized.</i>

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:41.696
<i>Is this what the inside
of your mind looks like?</i>

01:11:41.796 --> 01:11:43.727
Yeah.

01:11:45.632 --> 01:11:48.903
It's good to hear your voice.

01:11:49.604 --> 01:11:52.974
- You still there?
- <i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:56.044
Well... guess what?
I'm driving out to Marfa.

01:11:56.144 --> 01:11:59.079
I'm gonna go and meet
Grigory Volkov out there.

01:11:59.179 --> 01:12:00.948
- <i>Your hero.</i>
- Yeah.

01:12:01.048 --> 01:12:03.484
But listen, do you want
to catch up when I get back?

01:12:03.584 --> 01:12:05.587
I mean, we could just go
and grab a coffee or something.

01:12:05.687 --> 01:12:07.823
I'd love to hear how things
are going for you.

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:12.343
Yeah, they're going...
they're going well.

01:12:12.443 --> 01:12:14.825
<i>How about you? Are you... you good?</i>

01:12:14.925 --> 01:12:19.067
Honestly, Kat, never better.
Things are... things are great, yeah.

01:12:19.167 --> 01:12:21.754
- So, Marfa?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:27.241
Actually, what are you doing? You don't
want to come meet me out there, do you?

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:30.545
Yeah, no, silly idea. Sorry.

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:33.147
But listen, why don't you give me
a call when I'm back.

01:12:33.247 --> 01:12:36.108
I'm actually a bit slammed next week
with the opening, so...

01:12:36.208 --> 01:12:40.121
but look, we'll find a time.
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:12:40.221 --> 01:12:44.460
- <i>Yeah... just one little thing.</i>
- Okay, great. I'll just talk to you soon?

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.754
- <i>Just one little thing.</i>
- Sorry?

01:12:45.854 --> 01:12:49.396
<i>Danny wants to sell me
half of your business.</i>

01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:57.516
<i>Danny was asking for $200.
I talked him down to $150.</i>

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:03.277
Still there?

01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:08.249
- You know he's a lunatic.
- <i>Yeah. Yeah, I know. And Trevor, look,</i>

01:13:08.349 --> 01:13:10.653
- <i>I'm not gonna mess with your dream.</i>
- Hey, come on.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:13.354
<i>Don't worry, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna turn him down.</i>

01:13:13.454 --> 01:13:17.158
<i>Although you have to admit,
it would be kind of fun, right?</i>

01:13:17.258 --> 01:13:20.345
- Having me for a partner?
- <i>Hey, wait a minute.</i>

01:13:20.445 --> 01:13:24.031
<i>Wait a minute, don't turn him down.
Why don't you buy from him, yeah?</i>

01:13:24.131 --> 01:13:29.070
I mean, you pay him $150, and I'll pay you
10 times that or 20 times that, all right?

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:34.208
And then we can upgrade from coffee and
have a nice dinner, and everyone's happy.

01:13:34.308 --> 01:13:37.278
Hey, listen, can I just call you back?
I've just got to take this other call.

01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:40.681
- Fucking ants.
- Big business, I get it.

01:13:40.781 --> 01:13:44.551
<i>No, no, no, no, I'll call you back
in a minute, all right? It's not business.</i>

01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:47.418
A lovely lady then, perhaps.

01:13:47.518 --> 01:13:49.991
It's my daughter, Kat.
I'll talk to you in a minute.

01:13:54.662 --> 01:13:57.598
Are you fucking kidding me? I...

01:13:57.698 --> 01:14:00.355
I worked for you for two fucking years.

01:14:00.455 --> 01:14:03.240
I got close to you, I slept with you,

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.740
and you never even fucking mentioned
that you had a fucking daughter!

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.843
There's not even any pictures
up anywhere!

01:14:08.943 --> 01:14:13.047
Great, great. Things are really,
really hotting up around here.

01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:17.321
Hey, Raymond, come say hi to Gina.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:17.421 --> 01:14:19.888
Come say hi to Gina.
Say, "hello, hello, hello, Gina."

01:15:07.301 --> 01:15:09.203
Paul? When you call me back
when you get this, mate.

01:15:09.303 --> 01:15:14.344
I need to know what the fuck's going on.
So would you just give me a call? Cheers.

01:15:22.216 --> 01:15:24.385
Stop calling me.

01:15:24.485 --> 01:15:26.387
<i>Danny, I just want to talk, mate.</i>

01:15:26.487 --> 01:15:29.423
I know, that's why you keep calling.

01:15:29.523 --> 01:15:32.493
<i>Listen, if you're trying to piss me off,
you're doing a really good job.</i>

01:15:32.593 --> 01:15:35.729
No, I'm training you. I'm training you.

01:15:35.829 --> 01:15:39.228
- I don't understand why...
- <i>Just tell the girl you love her.</i>

01:15:39.328 --> 01:15:41.402
Stop calling.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:50.344
It is not fair to watch a fit man
eat pancakes for breakfast.

01:15:50.444 --> 01:15:53.147
And you say, "no, it is not fair."
No, it is not.

01:15:53.247 --> 01:15:57.034
It is not fair that your favorite movie star
can buy nice body from plastic doctor.

01:15:57.134 --> 01:16:02.222
Choose your misery...
you can cry, or you can work.

01:16:11.198 --> 01:16:13.501
That's great. That's fantastic.

01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:16.695
Yeah, it's basically a cult.

01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:19.274
- This food's divine.
- Thank you.

01:16:19.384 --> 01:16:22.990
I feel like that's the kind of stuff I'm
saying to my clients all the time, as well.

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:27.648
You know, there really is
no perfect body. That's a myth.

01:16:27.748 --> 01:16:32.119
But there's your perfect body,
so let's go and build that together.

01:16:32.219 --> 01:16:34.822
No. I mean,
this is a myth, too, I think.

01:16:34.922 --> 01:16:36.924
Yeah.

01:16:37.625 --> 01:16:39.927
I choose to make my body feel nice.

01:16:40.027 --> 01:16:41.962
I choose to marry a gorgeous woman

01:16:42.062 --> 01:16:44.932
who prepares food for me,
makes other men envious.

01:16:45.532 --> 01:16:48.307
But some day, this body
will break down. It will die.

01:16:48.407 --> 01:16:51.638
Just like some ugly fat man who smokes
two packs of cigarettes a day.

01:16:51.738 --> 01:16:55.142
I mean, it's okay,
but I do not call it perfect.

01:16:55.242 --> 01:16:57.979
No. No, you know what? I think the only
time I heard you say the word "perfect"

01:16:58.079 --> 01:17:00.981
was that one time
that you called that guy...

01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:06.407
What was his name, that CrossFit guy?
You called him the perfect asshole.

01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:09.657
Well, sometimes,
I'm not so clear as I need to be.

01:17:09.757 --> 01:17:13.094
- No, I know exactly what you meant.
- Yeah, I think you're perfectly clear.

01:17:13.194 --> 01:17:14.891
And... you know,

01:17:15.091 --> 01:17:18.361
hearing it from you, hearing this stuff
from you, it's really inspiring.

01:17:18.461 --> 01:17:20.467
I mean, that's why I wanted
to come and see you, you know,

01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:23.203
is to really learn
from your experiences.

01:17:23.303 --> 01:17:25.215
But I also wanted
to sort of just share with you

01:17:25.315 --> 01:17:27.908
a little bit about what I'm doing
back in Austin.

01:17:28.008 --> 01:17:31.712
I... I've always dreamed about
having great guests like you

01:17:31.812 --> 01:17:34.982
come and give seminars,
etcetera, but you know,

01:17:35.082 --> 01:17:36.583
I've never had the space,

01:17:36.683 --> 01:17:38.952
and I've never had the infrastructure
to make it worth your while.

01:17:39.052 --> 01:17:42.189
But now I'm expanding
into something larger.

01:17:42.289 --> 01:17:44.292
You know, it's like you say.

01:17:44.392 --> 01:17:48.529
I dreamed of something, and then...
and then I made it happen.

01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:52.366
No. What I say is stop dreaming.

01:17:52.466 --> 01:17:54.468
Yeah.

01:17:56.637 --> 01:17:59.074
Well, I guess, you know... I guess
we're talking about the same thing,

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:00.642
But maybe getting at it
in a different way.

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:03.711
Like, I start with a dream,
and then make a reality.

01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:06.647
No, why do you always
starting with the dream?

01:18:24.598 --> 01:18:26.166
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:28.479
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, good.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.437
- You look great.
- Thank you.

01:18:30.537 --> 01:18:33.374
- You look great.
- Thank you.

01:18:33.474 --> 01:18:35.376
You, too.

01:18:35.476 --> 01:18:38.245
- Thank you.
- Been working out?

01:18:38.345 --> 01:18:40.113
- Yeah. A little bit.
- Yeah.

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:42.917
I'm so sorry that you came out
all this way. He'll...

01:18:43.017 --> 01:18:45.381
No, that's fine. It was
a really lovely night. Thanks.

01:18:45.481 --> 01:18:47.655
- Thanks very much.
- Yeah.

01:18:48.388 --> 01:18:50.324
Just when you thought you were
a million miles away from trouble.

01:18:50.424 --> 01:18:52.092
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:18:52.192 --> 01:18:54.762
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

01:19:19.286 --> 01:19:22.323
So, it's supposed to be a seven hour
drive, but I think I did it in five.

01:19:22.423 --> 01:19:25.409
I don't see a cop the whole way,
and then I get pulled over

01:19:25.509 --> 01:19:31.051
for gliding through a stop sign
half a block away. Can you believe it?

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:38.672
I don't think I've ever seen you
not in your workout clothes before.

01:19:38.772 --> 01:19:42.243
- You've seen me not in workout clothes.
- You know... you know what I mean.

01:19:42.343 --> 01:19:46.380
So, where is this kettle bell guru?
Can I meet him?

01:19:48.315 --> 01:19:52.085
- Hello!
- You bring criminals to this house!

01:19:52.185 --> 01:19:57.114
Mr. Volkov, I'm Trevor's
business partner. I own 50%.

01:19:57.214 --> 01:20:00.139
I don't know if he's gotten into the whole
Power 4 Life philosophy with you guys.

01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:02.663
Yes. He told me he would like me
to lead kettle bell seminar

01:20:02.763 --> 01:20:06.034
while yogis are levitating in one room
and psychiatrists are sitting on the couch.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:09.637
Well, the philosophy, is kind of...
It's kind of bullshit, but...

01:20:09.737 --> 01:20:13.374
Before I married Erin, I was...
I dated a Mexican woman.

01:20:13.474 --> 01:20:16.343
I dated a Chinese woman, a black woman,

01:20:16.443 --> 01:20:18.979
but never at the same time... you know.

01:20:20.214 --> 01:20:24.675
But if Trevor didn't believe
that stuff, I mean, all of it,

01:20:24.775 --> 01:20:28.321
the business wouldn't work,
and that's what makes him amazing.

01:20:28.421 --> 01:20:29.890
Well, he's a poet.

01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:33.094
Let's not forget I founded this business,
and I built it from nothing.

01:20:33.194 --> 01:20:36.830
Look, he's basically like a Zen master.

01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:40.567
- Really? Do you study Eastern thought?
- No, not beyond the lame...

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:42.937
Actually, this is weird. I was thinking
about this on the drive up.

01:20:43.037 --> 01:20:46.774
Did you guys only notice that pretty much
only men are Zen masters?

01:20:46.874 --> 01:20:50.334
No, no, that's not true. Think about,
like, Pema Chodron for example.

01:20:50.434 --> 01:20:54.048
Whatever. That's like a female
bodybuilder or arm wrestler.

01:20:54.148 --> 01:20:57.351
- I mean, it's... right on, you go, girl.
- Kat. Kat.

01:20:57.451 --> 01:21:00.454
- No one's really gonna know who...
- You're really... you're talking nonsense.

01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:04.603
- It's adorable, but it's not...
- Wait, no. Trevor, seriously.

01:21:04.703 --> 01:21:11.031
It's like, this... this idea is that
everything is just gonna roll off of you.

01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:14.201
You know, that... that you're gonna
beat the world at its own game

01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:18.038
by never letting yourself
get angry or sad.

01:21:18.138 --> 01:21:22.843
To me, it's like, only a guy would think
that that was an awesome idea.

01:21:23.393 --> 01:21:25.806
Do you... do you want some more?
There's plenty.

01:21:25.906 --> 01:21:29.382
Hell, yes. Yes.
Yeah, it's so good. Thank you.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.062
- So, he's your boyfriend?
- No.

01:21:36.162 --> 01:21:38.392
No, no. We're strictly business now.

01:21:38.492 --> 01:21:41.761
I would... I'd call him my ex-boyfriend,

01:21:41.861 --> 01:21:45.916
but even that feels generous.
It was pretty fucking casual.

01:21:46.016 --> 01:21:47.668
But you run his life?

01:21:47.768 --> 01:21:49.870
You're saying it's like a marriage,
but without the sex.

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:53.070
I'm sure your new boyfriend would be happy
you have another man to control.

01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:55.942
Well, I control them all, so...

01:21:56.042 --> 01:21:58.178
So you're seeing someone, then?

01:21:58.278 --> 01:22:02.483
- Well, a few contenders, you know.
- Just contenders, no champions?

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:05.185
He loves his athletics metaphors.

01:22:05.285 --> 01:22:07.888
- Listen, I'm aware that you somehow...
- Amazing. Thank you so much.

01:22:07.988 --> 01:22:10.491
You think that I'm in denial
or naive or something

01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:12.228
because I express emotions
differently than you?

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:15.423
Trevor, I don't think that it's your fault.
I really don't think it's your fault.

01:22:15.523 --> 01:22:20.468
I think that you have no idea
what is going on in your own brain.

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:24.204
I mean, you know optimal,
and you know suboptimal,

01:22:24.304 --> 01:22:27.359
and clearly, I am suboptimal for you.

01:22:27.459 --> 01:22:30.744
- Well, clearly, I am suboptimal for you...
- Can I ask you guys a question?

01:22:30.844 --> 01:22:32.518
- Not to mention inappropriate.
- Well, that's true.

01:22:32.618 --> 01:22:34.882
You have a daughter that's probably
my age, and that is pretty fucked up.

01:22:34.982 --> 01:22:39.323
- Gina's 22, and you're 29. She's 29.
- Actually, I'm 30 now.

01:22:39.423 --> 01:22:42.691
I turned 30 since you saw me last, which
is why I just seem so much more mature.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.944
Happy birthday.
And listen, for the record,

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:47.143
I did tell you about Gina
that first time we went to lunch,

01:22:47.243 --> 01:22:48.989
which was before we were
sleeping together.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:52.407
I don't think you were paying attention to
what this old man was crapping on about.

01:22:52.507 --> 01:22:56.116
You guys actually... you really
do sound married. You do.

01:22:56.216 --> 01:22:59.940
You know, I'm the one who supposedly,
you know, not in touch with his feelings,

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.549
but look at the name
on my business. Yeah?

01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:10.012
I'm very aware of how important
emotions are to the balance of our lives.

01:23:10.515 --> 01:23:13.519
But, you know, I'm the one
who experienced,

01:23:13.619 --> 01:23:16.556
despite my better judgment...

01:23:16.656 --> 01:23:21.060
I'll call it a genuine longing for you.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.695
My.

01:23:22.795 --> 01:23:27.334
You're gonna call it
a genuine longing for me?

01:23:31.404 --> 01:23:33.440
Grigory, you've been very generous
with your time.

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:35.969
Erin, your hospitality's been
fantastic. Thank you.

01:23:36.069 --> 01:23:38.512
- This night must not end.
- I just think we should go.

01:23:38.612 --> 01:23:40.847
- Some more coffee now?
- Yeah.

01:23:40.947 --> 01:23:44.318
You can't keep making her get up, man.
Geez, whatever happened to chivalry?

01:23:44.418 --> 01:23:46.841
- I got it.
- Thank you.

01:23:49.823 --> 01:23:51.791
I like her.

01:23:51.891 --> 01:23:56.730
Yeah, I like her, too.
That's not the issue. I just don't...

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:59.767
You know, we just couldn't work out.
We wouldn't...

01:23:59.867 --> 01:24:01.469
Work out.

01:24:07.207 --> 01:24:09.309
This trip was a waste of time,

01:24:09.409 --> 01:24:14.348
so I'm not gonna blame you
for ruining the night.

01:24:14.448 --> 01:24:21.209
But I just need you to know, Kat,
that my life is not a waste of time.

01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:29.212
Hey, guys.
Grigory wanted me to let you know

01:24:29.312 --> 01:24:32.866
that he wanted you to find a way
to work together in the future.

01:24:32.966 --> 01:24:36.803
Maybe keep in contact with him,
these are a gift from him.

01:24:36.903 --> 01:24:39.364
They're from his line which you might
consider carrying?

01:24:39.464 --> 01:24:42.276
- Cool, yeah. We'll keep in touch.
- Okay.

01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:44.977
- Yeah, thanks again for dinner.
- Yeah, of course, it was really fun.

01:24:45.077 --> 01:24:48.649
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you. Night.

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:52.118
Hey, I'm sorry, Trevor.

01:24:55.922 --> 01:25:00.661
I'm gonna write you a check for $3,000
when we get back to Austin, and then...

01:25:01.928 --> 01:25:05.332
I would like us to try and be friends.

01:25:05.532 --> 01:25:08.401
You really think that's gonna work?

01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:11.405
Well, I think it works how
we want it to work, don't you?

01:25:11.505 --> 01:25:13.841
Are we just gonna let Danny pull
the strings and give him what he wants

01:25:13.941 --> 01:25:17.077
'cause the wealthy client's
always right?

01:25:17.177 --> 01:25:18.846
What... what does he want?

01:25:19.546 --> 01:25:23.149
How much did you hate me at the end?

01:25:23.617 --> 01:25:25.252
Not as much as you hated me.

01:25:25.352 --> 01:25:29.423
Well, I know you. That's why.
It's... that's the beauty part.

01:25:29.523 --> 01:25:31.559
Maybe.

01:25:32.359 --> 01:25:38.365
Okay, you know who my cab driver was
this morning in Austin to the airport?

01:25:38.465 --> 01:25:39.900
Do I know this person?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.070
No, I mean... No, he's just some guy.
I don't know him. You don't know him.

01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:45.539
He was just this guy
who looked like Willie Nelson.

01:25:45.639 --> 01:25:48.708
I thought everybody down there
looked like Willie Nelson.

01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:51.845
Not everybody. Anyway, he...
this guy... he was just...

01:25:51.945 --> 01:25:55.615
This guy was from America.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:59.519
He's like this old hippie guy
driving a cab.

01:25:59.619 --> 01:26:04.958
You know, telling me his whole...
like, long Texas life story.

01:26:05.058 --> 01:26:08.028
And I'm, like, this is...
it's not my story.

01:26:08.128 --> 01:26:10.163
It's not my, like, it's not...
This is not my reality.

01:26:10.263 --> 01:26:13.066
I get off the plane at JFK,
catch a cab, yellow cab, right?

01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:17.104
Pakistani guy is on his cellphone,
yammering away to another Pakistani guy,

01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:20.106
totally ignoring me,
and I'm just in the back seat going,

01:26:20.206 --> 01:26:22.743
"yeah, man, this is more like it."

01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:26.446
So, come back. Is there some, like...

01:26:26.546 --> 01:26:29.549
some legal thing you got to stay
for the money or something?

01:26:29.649 --> 01:26:32.953
No, there's no... there's nothing
keeping me there.

01:26:33.053 --> 01:26:34.855
It's my money. I can do
whatever I want with it.

01:26:34.955 --> 01:26:39.026
I can do anything
I want with it, you know?

01:26:39.626 --> 01:26:44.264
And I think... I'm thinking, you know...

01:26:44.942 --> 01:26:46.800
that, you know...

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.703
If you're gonna start
to fucking romance me...

01:26:51.403 --> 01:26:54.308
- What?
- I'll fucking stab you.

01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:57.610
With this cheese grater knife.

01:26:57.710 --> 01:27:00.480
Listen, don't stab me, all right?

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:04.117
I'm not. I'm not trying to do that.

01:27:04.217 --> 01:27:06.926
I love you. I love you, I do.
I still love you.

01:27:07.026 --> 01:27:10.590
- I just think I can...
- God, no, don't.

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:14.561
I do... listen, you know what
kind of place we could get?

01:27:14.661 --> 01:27:16.963
I mean, amazing. New place.

01:27:17.063 --> 01:27:21.868
We could move into a brownstone on
Gramercy Park if we want. That's what I...

01:27:21.968 --> 01:27:25.739
- You want to make this difficult for me?
- No.

01:27:25.872 --> 01:27:29.443
- Again?
- I'm not. I'm not, no.

01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:32.578
I'm talking about our marriage.

01:27:37.617 --> 01:27:40.053
I don't know. Did I do something wrong?

01:27:40.153 --> 01:27:44.157
I did... that came...
I did it wrong. I did it wrong.

01:27:44.457 --> 01:27:46.826
I've always been loyal.

01:27:47.327 --> 01:27:49.730
That's just who I am.

01:27:51.097 --> 01:27:53.600
Let's talk about trust?

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:58.839
Trust is one of those things that we have
to earn from each other, all right?

01:27:58.939 --> 01:28:04.010
And some people... some bloody people
just can't fucking control themselves.

01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:06.746
Man, that sure is a beautiful dog.

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:08.915
Thanks.

01:28:30.871 --> 01:28:33.440
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hey, If I hadn't been a client,</i>

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.509
<i>if I had just been some
funny stoner that you met,</i>

01:28:36.609 --> 01:28:39.245
<i>would I have had a shot at you?</i>

01:28:39.345 --> 01:28:41.447
Answer my question first.

01:28:41.547 --> 01:28:46.092
<i>Trevor can tell you what this is all about.
He should tell you, but I don't know.</i>

01:28:46.192 --> 01:28:48.388
I don't get reality anymore.

01:28:48.488 --> 01:28:51.558
<i>Well, you have been smoking
a lot of pot for a long time.</i>

01:28:51.658 --> 01:28:54.628
Well, that's just part of it. Come on.

01:28:54.728 --> 01:28:58.965
<i>Did I have a shot with you?
This is sort of important.</i>

01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:02.969
Well, I think you're awesome,

01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:05.272
but the short answer is no.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.510
What's the long answer?

01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:11.614
<i>No.</i>

01:29:13.814 --> 01:29:16.749
Okay, well, I'm doing one thing right.

01:29:16.849 --> 01:29:18.852
<i>What?</i>

01:29:20.687 --> 01:29:22.606
Yeah.

01:29:26.359 --> 01:29:28.162
- Well...
- You're not sleeping in the car, are you?

01:29:28.263 --> 01:29:30.700
I have this ex-client, Tallie.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:33.732
Very hot body. She would love
to meet a crazy-ass rich dude.

01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:36.236
- Is that Danny?
- You know what? Scratch that, actually.

01:29:36.336 --> 01:29:40.273
You can do better. It doesn't even matter
anyway, Danny. Just go to these bars

01:29:40.373 --> 01:29:42.833
- where these chicks hang out and say...
- Can I talk to him?

01:29:42.933 --> 01:29:45.412
"Hey, I'm a rich guy
looking to treat a lady nice."

01:29:45.512 --> 01:29:48.315
- You could even go to, like, a sorority.
- Here. Give us the phone.

01:29:48.415 --> 01:29:50.917
Okay, Trevor wants to yell at you.

01:29:51.017 --> 01:29:54.789
- Hey, Danny. I feel betrayed, man.
- He says you want to tell me something?

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:58.008
<i>I broke up with my fucking
wife again, man.</i>

01:29:58.108 --> 01:30:01.161
<i>Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's... yeah, that's tough.</i>

01:30:01.261 --> 01:30:04.631
You know, you're just gonna have to grieve,
and then when you're ready,

01:30:04.731 --> 01:30:09.936
you're gonna have to pick yourself up
and start using that heart muscle again.

01:30:10.036 --> 01:30:12.538
- What?
- Just put it on speaker.

01:30:12.638 --> 01:30:15.242
It was like I was saying
last night, you know?

01:30:15.342 --> 01:30:17.436
I know, Kat told me the same thing,
you know, like,

01:30:17.536 --> 01:30:20.580
- that I should go out and get some bimbo.
- <i>Just someone who's nice to you.</i>

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.818
No, not a bimbo. Just a starter girlfriend.
Just something lightweight, okay?

01:30:24.918 --> 01:30:28.188
You've got some bad habits.
You just need to retrain yourself.

01:30:28.288 --> 01:30:30.657
- <i>That's a fitness metaphor.</i>
- Just start all over again?

01:30:30.757 --> 01:30:33.527
<i>You just... you got to be strong, okay?
You got to be focused.</i>

01:30:33.627 --> 01:30:36.929
<i>You've also got to have fun, though,
remember that, okay?</i>

01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:42.849
- I got to go.
- <i>Danny?</i>

01:30:42.949 --> 01:30:46.306
Don't you fucking touch me! Fuck you!

01:30:51.678 --> 01:30:54.447
What the fuck, man?

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:03.256
Five hundred and forty two photos
in this folder,

01:31:03.356 --> 01:31:05.493
and they're just
the greatest hits, really.

01:31:09.728 --> 01:31:12.699
I might have a shower, I think.

01:31:26.012 --> 01:31:29.582
Is Lorenzo really a bisexual gigolo?

01:31:30.282 --> 01:31:33.820
Yeah. Not full-time,
but he has sex with both genders

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.792
and gets gifts for that, so, yeah.

01:31:42.428 --> 01:31:46.133
Well, that's fine, I guess.

01:31:53.406 --> 01:31:56.209
Good night, again.

01:31:56.609 --> 01:31:58.679
Night.

01:32:29.442 --> 01:32:32.569
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:33:20.026 --> 01:33:21.179
Come on, keep up.

01:34:12.445 --> 01:34:14.713
Now what?

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.421
God.

01:34:25.892 --> 01:34:27.730
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:32.265
Somewhere in the desert
way ahead of you in the dorkmobile.

01:34:32.365 --> 01:34:34.201
Are you hungry?

01:34:40.173 --> 01:34:43.043
- Is that okay?
- It's perfect, thanks.

01:34:43.143 --> 01:34:45.912
Carlos said he knew how to do it.
I just had never heard of it before

01:34:46.012 --> 01:34:48.515
- with the whites of the eggs.
- This is exactly right.

01:34:48.615 --> 01:34:51.484
So you just kind
of pull the yolk out of it?

01:34:51.584 --> 01:34:54.192
Yeah, you can just pour it back
from one half to the other,

01:34:54.292 --> 01:34:57.133
and eventually,
they'll just separate out.

01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:59.325
Does it taste better?

01:34:59.425 --> 01:35:02.395
No, it's just less in saturated fat.

01:35:02.495 --> 01:35:04.330
Okay.

01:35:11.704 --> 01:35:13.006
Hey, are you still going
to want to fuck me

01:35:13.106 --> 01:35:17.477
if we have to talk business partner stuff
every day? I might not want to fuck you.

01:35:17.577 --> 01:35:19.846
Listen, babe, I don't want to put
words in your mouth, but...

01:35:19.946 --> 01:35:23.349
- Where is this "babe" thing coming from?
- I was under the impression

01:35:23.449 --> 01:35:26.553
that you were burnt out on training.

01:35:26.653 --> 01:35:31.524
Well, yeah, you know. I just got tired
of selling everyone this bullshit

01:35:31.624 --> 01:35:34.961
that I could change their lives
for them, you know?

01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:38.304
I know we're supposed to be telling them
that they're doing it for themselves,

01:35:38.404 --> 01:35:40.266
- but I mean, come on.
- You just got to trust them.

01:35:40.366 --> 01:35:43.061
And by the way, this is still
the business we're in, okay?

01:35:43.161 --> 01:35:46.653
You can change their lives
because you believe in it,

01:35:46.753 --> 01:35:51.077
and Trevor, that's fine. I'm just...
I'm in the back now running the shit.

01:35:51.177 --> 01:35:54.113
Lunch is on me, by the way.

01:35:56.182 --> 01:36:00.187
Look, I think we can both agree that
sleeping together, taken on its own merits,

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:01.655
- it's pretty fantastic.
- It's not terrible.

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:06.559
It just hasn't always had
good outcomes, though, has it?

01:36:07.226 --> 01:36:10.189
- If you don't believe that people can...
- Excuse me!

01:36:10.289 --> 01:36:13.099
- ...change.
- Excuse me.

01:36:14.066 --> 01:36:18.638
Yeah, there's an extra charge on here
for substitution on his omelette.

01:36:18.738 --> 01:36:21.874
Well, like I said, we've never done that
before with the whites of the eggs.

01:36:21.974 --> 01:36:23.987
- It's fine, just...
- That's not an substitution,

01:36:24.087 --> 01:36:26.412
that's a subtraction, so if anything,
it should be costing less.

01:36:26.512 --> 01:36:28.848
It's more work, Kat. It's more.
They've got to separate it.

01:36:28.948 --> 01:36:32.285
You can talk to my manager if you want,
but I'm supposed to charge you for that.

01:36:32.385 --> 01:36:34.472
- Why? It's common sense.
- Kat. Kat.

01:36:34.572 --> 01:36:37.423
No, Trevor, listen. If you say,
"I want a cup of black coffee,

01:36:37.523 --> 01:36:40.579
don't bring me any cream or sugar,"
do you charge extra

01:36:40.679 --> 01:36:45.498
for the trouble of not providing those
things? I mean, come on. It's ridiculous.

01:36:45.598 --> 01:36:47.984
Okay, you're kind of getting rude.

01:36:48.084 --> 01:36:51.704
Jesus Christ, Kat. Here. Just take my
credit card and charge the whole amount,

01:36:51.804 --> 01:36:53.873
and I promise,
you'll get a really good tip.

01:36:53.973 --> 01:36:55.909
Thank you.

01:36:57.977 --> 01:36:59.545
Man, you love getting ripped off,

01:36:59.645 --> 01:37:02.114
which is another reason you need me
as a business partner.

01:37:02.214 --> 01:37:04.783
Listen, do you have feelings for me?

01:37:05.881 --> 01:37:08.221
Yeah, I mean...

01:37:08.321 --> 01:37:09.722
What do you mean?

01:37:10.522 --> 01:37:13.793
Well, can you describe those feelings?

01:37:14.193 --> 01:37:17.263
Describe your feelings.

01:37:19.599 --> 01:37:24.114
You're unbelievable. I just can't
get you to admit to anything.

01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:28.274
I mean, I should just walk out of here
and go and get a lawyer.

01:37:28.374 --> 01:37:32.022
Two lawyers, actually. One to sue
Danny for trying to fuck me over

01:37:32.122 --> 01:37:34.714
and one to take out a restraining order
on you, but I'm not doing that.

01:37:34.814 --> 01:37:36.449
I'm not doing that.

01:37:36.549 --> 01:37:38.645
But can you at least just tell me

01:37:38.745 --> 01:37:43.256
how you think it's fair that I'm gonna
torpedo my life because I love you?

01:37:48.294 --> 01:37:50.793
You have a good day.

01:37:59.806 --> 01:38:03.043
- Let's just go, shall we?
- Yeah.

01:38:20.893 --> 01:38:22.962
I'll see you back in Austin.

01:38:23.062 --> 01:38:25.097
Okay.

01:38:25.197 --> 01:38:27.701
Can I ask you something?

01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:34.507
What did Danny want you to tell me?

01:38:39.311 --> 01:38:42.048
All right, okay.

01:38:42.715 --> 01:38:45.231
But, also...

01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:49.722
I love you, too.

01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:17.183
We're both so screwed.

01:39:17.283 --> 01:39:20.720
We're really, really screwed.

01:39:21.053 --> 01:39:23.523
And I feel dizzy,
which I'm also too old for.

01:39:23.623 --> 01:39:26.492
Tell me if it doesn't feel good.

01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:33.765
It feels great.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:59.057
- No, go back. I like that show.
- No, no, douche city.

01:40:01.294 --> 01:40:03.062
Okay.

01:40:03.162 --> 01:40:04.431
Hi.

01:40:06.465 --> 01:40:08.601
Can we help you?

01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:12.505
Yeah, your door was open.
My name's Danny.

01:40:12.605 --> 01:40:14.754
I'm a multimillionaire.

01:40:14.854 --> 01:40:18.044
I was gonna throw a party at my house,
sort of an outreach thing.

01:40:18.144 --> 01:40:21.981
I know your sisterhood does
a lot of community service,

01:40:22.081 --> 01:40:24.784
and this is just sort of a thank you.

01:40:24.884 --> 01:40:29.288
Booze and everything,
on me, and... yeah.

01:40:29.388 --> 01:40:33.759
Come on over, bring your friends.
Bring whatever. Whatever you want.

01:40:34.959 --> 01:40:36.226
Yeah.

01:40:38.965 --> 01:40:41.367
I'm not a douchebag.
