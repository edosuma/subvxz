WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:04.086
MOLLY:
<i>My name is Molly Woods.</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:05.964
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

00:06.047 --> 00:07.966
<i>My husband John,</i>
<i>a robotics engineer,</i>

00:08.048 --> 00:10.468
<i>created a lifelike robot</i>
<i>called a Humanich.</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:14.055
<i>We adopted the prototype</i>
<i>as our son.</i>

00:14.139 --> 00:17.016
<i>His name is Ethan.</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:20.270
<i>Everything changed</i>
<i>when I went to space</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:21.813
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:21.896 --> 00:23.606
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:24.774
I'm pregnant.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.276
{\an3}How is that
even possible?

00:26.359 --> 00:28.820
<i>The child--</i>
<i>part human, part alien--</i>

00:28.903 --> 00:31.114
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:33.158
How did you get
so big so fast?

00:33.241 --> 00:35.452
<i>And he was dangerous.</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:37.245
<i>Eventually...</i>
Run!

00:37.328 --> 00:39.122
<i>...I lost both of my sons...</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:41.124
{\an1}Ethan!
Mom!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.168
(train horn blaring)
<i>...and my husband.</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:45.587
<i>Some people say</i>
<i>I've gone crazy.</i>

00:45.670 --> 00:47.464
This is a cover-up!
That's what this is!

00:47.547 --> 00:49.466
Get your hands off of me!

00:49.549 --> 00:51.760
<i>I say there's more</i>
<i>to the story.</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.845
<i>It's up to me</i>
<i>to find the truth,</i>

00:53.928 --> 00:56.848
<i>before it's too late.</i>

00:58.516 --> 00:59.976
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

01:00.059 --> 01:01.144
To your best knowledge,

01:01.227 --> 01:02.812
<i>no alien life-forms</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.313
<i>have set foot</i>
<i>on the planet Earth.</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:05.315
Are you sure he's dead?

01:05.397 --> 01:07.817
He was dangerous, Molly.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.985
{\an4}JOHN:
Ethan!
Mom!

01:09.068 --> 01:09.986
AGENT:
<i>The Humanich has been declared</i>

01:10.069 --> 01:11.196
{\an1}the property
of the U.S. government

01:11.279 --> 01:12.655
{\an1}for reasons of
national security.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.783
He's not property,
he's our son!

01:14.866 --> 01:17.327
When am I going home, Julie?
This is your home now.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.788
We think you're not quite
ready for re-entry.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.372
DAVE:
<i>You hear about that woman?</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:22.707
<i>Her belly blown open?</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:24.501
{\an1}I am really
not a lunatic.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.544
Say the lady that broke
out of Crazy Acres

01:26.628 --> 01:28.713
<i>and then trespassed</i>
<i>onto my crime scene.</i>

01:28.797 --> 01:30.006
MOLLY:
<i>I think</i>

01:30.089 --> 01:31.508
I might know what happened here.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.967
{\an1}RICHTER:
That's a court order,

01:33.051 --> 01:34.177
and she's a material witness

01:34.260 --> 01:35.345
in a homicide investigation.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.846
<i>I'll have her back in 72 hour,</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:38.389
<i>no worse for the wear.</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:39.974
<i>Want to tell me what the hell</i>
<i>this is about?</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:43.686
{\an1}This isn't
a murder investigation.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.979
It's an invasion.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.490
How are we, Shayna?

01:55.573 --> 01:56.699
{\an3}The SEAL team
is in position,

01:56.783 --> 01:58.576
awaiting your orders.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.036
Put it up on the big screen.

02:00.119 --> 02:01.412
SEAL (over radio):
Bravo Team in position.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.664
SEAL 2:
Alpha Team ready to breach.

02:02.747 --> 02:03.915
Status?

02:03.998 --> 02:05.250
{\an3}Target has been
confirmed.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.168
{\an1}We've got him
surrounded.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.086
Sir, Alpha Team is ready
to breach. Awaiting your go.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.547
{\an1}Right.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.632
Send them in.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.217
That is a go.
Alpha Team, go.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.054
SEAL:
Move! Move, move!

02:19.138 --> 02:21.516
Northwest corridor is clear.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.059
Enemy contact,
second floor southeast.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.060
We've got eyes on the target.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.437
That is a visual match.
You are clear to engage.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.064
SEAL 2: Let's see your hands!
Do not move!

02:28.147 --> 02:29.315
Put your hands up!
What are you doing?

02:29.399 --> 02:30.608
(SEAL groans)

02:30.692 --> 02:32.110
{\an5}(gunfire continues)
Wait! Stop!
Gun down!

02:32.193 --> 02:33.570
(gunshots continue)
Aah! At your six!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.071
They're turning on each other.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.155
{\an1}SHEPHERD:
Get 'em out of there.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.615
Alpha Team, stand down.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.951
Disengage and fall back.

02:40.034 --> 02:41.452
{\an3}If you can hear me,
Alpha Team,

02:41.536 --> 02:43.037
{\an3}disengage
and fall back.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.789
Do not engage the target.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.541
(gunfire continues)

02:46.624 --> 02:47.542
Abort mission.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.085
I repeat, abort mission.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.088
(gunfire continues)

02:52.171 --> 02:53.631
(rifles fire)

02:53.715 --> 02:54.883
{\an1}Ready.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.134
{\an1}Aim.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.136
{\an3}Fire.
(gunshots)

02:58.219 --> 02:59.637
{\an3}Ready.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.889
Aim.

03:00.972 --> 03:01.931
Fire.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.266
(gunshots)

03:03.349 --> 03:06.227
Present... arms!

03:09.188 --> 03:11.065
What's going on?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.150
It's Molly Woods.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.277
{\an3}She's out.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.408
(engine roaring,
tires squealing)

03:20.491 --> 03:21.576
MOLLY:
<i>Where are we going?</i>

03:21.659 --> 03:22.952
Back to the Recovery Center.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.662
{\an1}Why?
I don't believe

03:24.746 --> 03:26.748
in little green men
with ray guns.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.082
And neither do I!

03:28.166 --> 03:29.792
The minute you start
talking about aliens,

03:29.876 --> 03:32.128
we go back to the funny farm.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.297
Okay, then what happens
to your case, Sherlock?

03:37.717 --> 03:40.011
(engine whirrs, powers down)

03:40.094 --> 03:42.138
(tires squeal)

03:42.221 --> 03:44.182
{\an1}All right.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.975
It's time for your meds.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.936
Maybe it'll make
the Martians go away.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.437
Nope. Not taking them.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.689
(sighs)

03:51.773 --> 03:54.150
Look, I signed you
out of Crazy Acres,

03:54.233 --> 03:56.611
{\an3}which makes me responsible
for your actions, all right?

03:56.694 --> 03:58.446
I can't have you running around

03:58.529 --> 04:01.324
like some kind of
drooling maniac.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.077
{\an3}So... take your
damn pills.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.707
Oh, come on.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.210
If you signed a drooling maniac
out of Crazy Acres,

04:12.293 --> 04:14.587
that's because I'm your
only hope to solve this case.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.547
{\an1}So if you want me
to help you,

04:16.630 --> 04:19.175
and tell you how I know
she was pregnant, for example,

04:19.257 --> 04:20.677
then I have to think clearly,

04:20.760 --> 04:22.845
and that means no pills.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.016
Start talking.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.559
Feed me first.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.478
(laughs)

04:32.438 --> 04:34.899
{\an1}JULIE:
Ethan, breakfast!

04:42.824 --> 04:45.535
So, I know it's
not the weekend

04:45.618 --> 04:49.622
but I broke down and made
chocolate chip pancakes.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.210
I'm having whipped cream
on mine, don't judge me.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.714
How's your new room?

04:57.797 --> 04:59.215
{\an3}I had to look on three
different Web sites

04:59.298 --> 05:00.425
to find that comforter.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.927
It's not the same.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.430
{\an3}Well, it's not
exactly the same,

05:05.513 --> 05:07.056
{\an1}but it's pretty close,
don't you think?

05:09.851 --> 05:11.894
Pancakes or cereal?
Dealer's choice.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.855
I don't want any.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.106
Come on, they have
chocolate chips in them.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.399
I hate chocolate chips.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.526
You do not. Come on...

05:18.609 --> 05:19.944
before it gets cold.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.822
I <i> said</i> I don't <i> want</i> any.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.867
Fine.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.243
What do you want?

05:27.326 --> 05:28.619
I want my parents.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.912
(sighs)

05:29.996 --> 05:31.456
Ethan, we talked about this.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.458
That isn't possible right now.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.959
Your dad is gone.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.711
But my mom's still alive.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.588
Yes, but she's not able to
take care of you right now.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.257
But I can go home
when she's better, right?

05:43.718 --> 05:45.011
We'll see.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.138
But for now, in the meantime,

05:47.221 --> 05:48.598
you're doing great here.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.807
You have your room
and your games

05:49.891 --> 05:51.726
and your toys and...

05:51.809 --> 05:53.770
pretty soon,
it's going to feel like home.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.396
But it's not my home.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.607
It is for now.
Well, I hate it.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.943
All right, get dressed;
we're going to work.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.445
I'm not going.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.946
Ethan, get dressed!

06:04.030 --> 06:06.074
You're not my mom!

06:16.167 --> 06:17.794
Can I get you
anything else?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.212
Coffee? Tea?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.838
Rack of lamb?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.298
(mouth full):
No, I'm good.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.467
{\an1}All right.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.595
Let's try this again, shall we?

06:27.678 --> 06:29.931
How'd you know she was pregnant?

06:30.014 --> 06:31.265
I recognized the symptoms.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.475
From where?

06:32.558 --> 06:35.311
{\an1}And please,
don't tell me "aliens."

06:35.394 --> 06:37.647
An old friend.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.817
An astronaut
who was impregnated in space.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.611
Impregnated by who?

06:43.694 --> 06:45.988
Well, you just told me
not to say it.

06:46.072 --> 06:50.201
(laughs)

06:50.284 --> 06:51.953
Oh...
Okay...

06:52.036 --> 06:55.164
you do know
that I was an astronaut, right?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.334
Well, I've spent lots of time
in deep space,

06:58.417 --> 07:01.671
doing experiments on organisms
and how they adapt and survive.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.757
And when I was out there,
I came across this...

07:04.841 --> 07:06.551
alien spore.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.553
And somehow,
it may have

07:08.636 --> 07:10.138
made its way back to Earth.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.224
Let me get this straight:

07:13.307 --> 07:15.685
You're telling me
that my perp is a spore?

07:15.768 --> 07:18.521
I can't put a spore in a lineup.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.693
If that alien spore

07:23.776 --> 07:25.653
infected a human being

07:25.736 --> 07:27.738
and then, that human being...

07:27.822 --> 07:29.031
Is impregnating women?

07:30.992 --> 07:33.411
How would we know?

07:33.494 --> 07:34.996
Blood sample.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.707
From the victim.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.250
I can get that from evidence.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.003
It's got to be from
when she was pregnant.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.008
(chirping, beeping)

07:50.011 --> 07:51.137
(explosion in game)

07:51.220 --> 07:52.763
How'd you get a game on here?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.390
I reprogrammed him.

07:54.473 --> 07:56.934
{\an1}Ethan, you're not allowed
to reprogram the tutor-bots.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.352
His name is Richard.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.854
"Richard" is for learning.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.856
{\an1}I want you to put him back
the way he was.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.524
Ethan, I said please put...

08:03.608 --> 08:04.942
{\an1}CHARLIE:
Hey. Julie.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.486
What's the Black Widow
doing here?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.115
Oh... can you?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.533
Yeah, yeah, I got him. Go.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.369
Anna...

08:15.453 --> 08:18.206
what a pleasant surprise.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.875
Richard, buddy, you're gonna
have to keep it down.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.084
Ooh, get that one. Get that one.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.711
{\an1}(explosion in game)
Ooh!

08:23.794 --> 08:25.087
I was expecting a build
verification two weeks ago.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.797
{\an3}I know.
I understand there's been

08:26.881 --> 08:28.257
some growing pains
with the new staff?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.717
It's not just
the new staff.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.094
{\an3}It's all new concepts
and processes.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.429
Ethan had almost a decade
of programming

08:34.514 --> 08:36.933
by experience of human
interaction, and we're trying

08:37.015 --> 08:39.393
to give Lucy twice that much
in a fraction of the time.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.811
We've skipped over

08:40.895 --> 08:42.270
every safety protocol
John would've taken.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.940
{\an1}All right, no disrespect
to your predecessor,

08:44.023 --> 08:45.233
but we don't have the luxury

08:45.316 --> 08:46.776
{\an1}of doing things
the old way, Julie.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.110
I need to see a test.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.362
{\an1}Today.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.030
Uh... (laughs)

08:51.113 --> 08:52.782
That's impossible.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.285
We're still fine-tuning the
ethical adaptor algorithms.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.496
They didn't even exist
when Ethan was built.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.998
{\an3}He learned right
and wrong from us.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.291
{\an3}This Humanich's learning
from an equation.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.543
Okay, Julie,

09:03.626 --> 09:05.211
I am sympathetic
to your situation

09:05.294 --> 09:07.338
{\an1}but if I don't show
my superiors some progress,

09:07.421 --> 09:09.340
{\an1}they will find someone else
who can deliver.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.009
{\an1}You know
that's the deal.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.135
You have until tonight.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.056
(explosion in game)

09:20.685 --> 09:21.978
The... 16th.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.314
{\an1}That was the first and
last time I saw her.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.983
She'd done a home version
of the test,

09:27.066 --> 09:28.985
but she wanted to know for
sure-- please don't touch that.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.322
Did you do a blood test?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.699
No, never got the chance.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.158
She decided to terminate.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.827
But she never showed up
for her appointment.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.745
That was the last I heard
of her, till I... saw the news.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.997
{\an3}RICHTER:
And there was no mention

09:41.080 --> 09:42.540
of the father at all?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.208
She seemed determined
to deal with it alone.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.584
I'd say there's a good chance
it was a...

09:45.668 --> 09:46.919
casual acquaintance.

09:47.003 --> 09:47.878
A one-night stand.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.672
{\an3}RICHTER:
Okay.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.841
Well, thank you for your time.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.511
Did she mention anything
unusual about her pregnancy?

09:57.638 --> 09:58.556
(clears throat)

09:58.639 --> 09:59.849
You know, legally,

09:59.932 --> 10:01.142
you're bound to tell us anything

10:01.225 --> 10:02.351
that could be relevant

10:02.435 --> 10:03.686
to our murder
investigation.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.356
There were, uh... complications.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.649
The baby's growth
was accelerated.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.695
Yes.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.697
{\an1}And at first,
I thought, well,

10:14.780 --> 10:16.073
maybe she'd, uh,
miscounted the weeks.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.284
But I was on Metro-MedNet...

10:18.367 --> 10:20.870
{\an4}What's that?
A VR chat room
for docs in the area.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.874
{\an1}There was a colleague
across town asking advice...

10:24.957 --> 10:26.208
She has a similar case.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.543
There's another one?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.755
All right,
when did you talk to her?

10:30.838 --> 10:32.006
This morning.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.843
There's your next victim.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.902
{\an1}We need her
to trust us, okay?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.653
If her baby has
the same father,

10:54.737 --> 10:56.614
she can give us
a description.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.616
{\an1}I know how to conduct
an investigation.

10:58.699 --> 11:01.744
{\an1}And, by the way,
I'm the investigator,

11:01.827 --> 11:03.579
{\an1}you are the sidekick
that doesn't talk.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.456
You have control issues.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.291
Are you Zoe Grant?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.751
Yes.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.628
Detective Richter,
special patrol.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.046
{\an3}What... what's
this about?

11:12.129 --> 11:14.465
{\an1}I'm in the middle
of a homicide investigation.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.467
{\an1}We think the father
of your child may have

11:16.550 --> 11:18.344
{\an1}some information
regarding the case.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.264
Can I help you
with something?

11:25.976 --> 11:27.478
MAN: Once you fill out
the online form,

11:27.561 --> 11:30.272
they use a matchmaker algorithm
to pick your ideal mate.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.274
And then you set
up a coffee date

11:32.358 --> 11:34.151
{\an3}in the Reverie
Meet-and-Mingle lounge.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.736
{\an3}So you don't actually
meet face-to-face.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.737
{\an3}MAN:
Not at first.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.155
Only your avatars.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.699
{\an1}We like to say it was
love at first byte.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.618
{\an3}With a "Y."
Mm.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.453
Seven years and counting.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.622
{\an1}RICHTER: And now you're
gonna be parents.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.917
And was, um...

11:50.000 --> 11:52.336
was this pregnancy
planned, or-or...?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.838
{\an1}MAN:
Complete accident.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.089
{\an3}But a happy
one, of course.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.633
We-we, we planned to wait

11:57.716 --> 12:00.177
{\an3}until genetic selection
procedures were more accurate.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.930
MAN: Gen-Sel would have made
sure the baby had her eyes.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.473
Oh, God.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.474
Oh.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.809
{\an1}Oh, gosh,
I'm so sorry.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.810
{\an1}No, it's fine.
Um...

12:07.893 --> 12:08.811
No biggie.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.229
I'll get a towel.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.149
{\an1}MOLLY:
Zoe...

12:13.232 --> 12:14.817
Mike's not the father
of this baby, is he?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.152
Molly!
What?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.486
You don't have to tell <i> him,</i>

12:17.570 --> 12:18.696
but you do have to tell us.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.114
{\an1}You could be
in real danger.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.824
All right, take it easy.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.909
{\an5}I don't know what
you're talking about.
Zoe...

12:25.369 --> 12:27.872
the baby is growing
too fast, isn't it?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.999
A-A-And you're starting

12:30.082 --> 12:32.209
{\an1}to see dead people
from your past, aren't you?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.836
Who are you people?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.838
{\an1}If you don't terminate
this pregnancy,

12:35.921 --> 12:37.715
you are gonna die.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.389
Who's the cop?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.683
Richter, JD.

12:47.766 --> 12:51.270
{\an1}Took her out on some sort
of provisional court order.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.815
Toby, we can't contain this
much longer,

12:54.899 --> 12:56.358
not with her
running around out there.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.944
People are beginning
to ask questions, internally.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.281
I have a meeting with Taylor
later, to assess our options.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.241
In the meantime, find
out everything you can

13:04.325 --> 13:05.409
about this Richter.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.995
Will do.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.874
Are you worried?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.043
About Taylor?
About Molly.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.421
You have a bit
of a soft spot.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.839
She's been through a lot,

13:18.923 --> 13:20.466
but that's not your concern.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.511
If it compromises the objective,
then it is my concern.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.513
Don't worry about my
relationship with Molly Woods,

13:25.596 --> 13:27.723
just find her
and the cop.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.517
Yes, sir.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.935
Of course.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.853
Sir.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.192
{\an1}What part of "sidekick
that doesn't talk"

13:38.275 --> 13:39.652
did you not understand?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.612
{\an1}You scared that woman
half to death.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.573
Do you realize I could lose my
license after that little stunt?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.200
GINA:
Welcome home, Molly.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.660
{\an1}Hi, Gina.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.246
You have 987
unanswered e-mails.

13:50.329 --> 13:50.996
Would you like to sort?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.289
Yes.
No.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.375
{\an3}We shouldn't even
be here, all right?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.377
This is just a pit stop.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.587
{\an3}I broke you out of the
funny farm so you...

13:58.671 --> 14:00.923
So I could help you, which is
exactly what I'm trying to do.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.925
{\an3}Now, you know as
well as I know

14:03.008 --> 14:04.969
that she was lying about Mike
being the father of that baby,

14:05.052 --> 14:06.554
{\an3}so we have to figure out
some other kind of way

14:06.637 --> 14:07.763
to get around this
thing-- we just...

14:07.846 --> 14:08.931
{\an1}There is no "we,"
all right?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.808
It's been a freak show

14:10.891 --> 14:12.643
since the moment
you jumped into my car--

14:12.726 --> 14:15.396
{\an1}aliens, classified missions,
accelerated pregnancies.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.232
My personal favorite?
Seeing dead people.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.608
And look at you.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.610
You're scratching
your own skin off.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.153
{\an1}I-I'm done--
I've had enough, all right?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.155
And clearly you need
your meds.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.283
We're gonna go back now.
Oh, no, no.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.410
You told me I could come
home and take a shower,

14:29.493 --> 14:31.203
{\an3}and I'm gonna go take
a freaking shower.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.707
Five minutes.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.041
Ten.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.573
(rock music blaring)

15:07.656 --> 15:08.532
JULIE: Can we please clean
this place up?

15:08.616 --> 15:09.908
It looks like a dorm room!

15:09.992 --> 15:11.160
We have two hours
to get this done!

15:11.243 --> 15:12.661
And turn that music down!

15:14.246 --> 15:16.165
Everybody hates
me, don't they?

15:16.248 --> 15:18.334
{\an1}Well, we've been working
around the clock.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.170
There was a near mutiny, but you
staved it off with ramen.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.339
It's just for tonight.
You didn't go promising

15:23.422 --> 15:25.049
another dozen fully-finished
Humanichs over the weekend?

15:25.132 --> 15:26.675
What was I supposed to say?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.177
Uh, "no."

15:30.137 --> 15:31.513
Oh... look.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.641
{\an3}This is how
mistakes get made.

15:33.724 --> 15:34.683
Mihalik, wake up.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.809
(snorts)

15:37.770 --> 15:40.522
{\an1}Look, Julie, I put a lot
of TLC into Lucy.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.691
{\an1}I want to flip that switch
as much as anyone,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.193
but we're not ready.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.070
We can handle a smoke test.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.447
When can I play my game
on the big speaker?

15:48.530 --> 15:52.201
{\an5}Not now, we're gonna
run a test soon.
Charlie promised.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.370
{\an1}Rabbit, I can't do this
right now-- go play your game.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.749
{\an3}Come on, Richard.
(Richard blips and squeaks)

15:58.832 --> 16:00.542
{\an5}Everything okay
at home?
He's been so difficult.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.503
It's hard to get anything
done these past few weeks.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.962
{\an1}You can hardly
blame him.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.506
{\an1}I mean,
his father's dead,

16:05.589 --> 16:06.548
{\an1}his mother's never
coming back.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.716
Yeah, he doesn't know that.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.884
What?

16:08.967 --> 16:10.719
I haven't told him

16:10.803 --> 16:12.554
that Molly's not
ever coming home.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.224
I just think it's
too much for him.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.892
So I just keep saying "maybe."

16:16.975 --> 16:18.602
{\an1}Julie, you can't string
him along like that.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.397
{\an3}I'm trying to balance a lot
of things here, Charlie.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.732
{\an5}And trying not to
hurt him.
He lost his parents,
his friends,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.109
his family, his home--

16:25.192 --> 16:26.568
{\an1}you can't put Pinocchio
back in the box

16:26.652 --> 16:28.112
{\an1}once you've turned him
into a boy.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.571
You have to deal with this.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.240
Well, maybe in an hour or so,

16:31.323 --> 16:32.783
{\an3}hopefully, we'll have another
Humanich in the world,

16:32.866 --> 16:34.410
and maybe having Lucy
will help him move on.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.744
He'll have a sister.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.579
{\an1}He doesn't need a sister.
He doesn't need Lucy.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.248
He needs the truth,
and you'd know that

16:39.331 --> 16:40.624
{\an1}if you'd pull your head
out of Anna's ass

16:40.708 --> 16:42.251
for one freaking second.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.422
I'm sorry.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.840
That's the MSG talking.

16:47.923 --> 16:48.924
No, I'm sorry.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.220
{\an3}I'm sorry for
not being John.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.514
Sorry for not living
up to your standards.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.516
{\an3}But I'm doing
everything I can.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.936
For you and for Ethan
and for this project.

17:01.019 --> 17:05.022
{\an3}So please stop
second-guessing me.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.618
{\an3}So is that what you're gonna
wear back to the hospital?

17:17.703 --> 17:21.290
Nope, but I am gonna
have a drink in it.

17:22.915 --> 17:24.792
Who's the kid?

17:26.252 --> 17:28.005
Ethan.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.465
He was my son.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.925
I didn't know you had a son.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.927
Yeah, well...

17:34.011 --> 17:35.304
he was a Humanich.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.806
He was a what?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.349
A robot.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.809
(chuckles)

17:43.687 --> 17:45.689
Oh, you're serious?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.566
Never a dull moment
with you, is there?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.570
Not if I can help it.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.409
Don't make me drink alone.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.747
Just one.

18:12.216 --> 18:16.512
So tell me, is there a
robot husband as well?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.514
Uh-uh.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.015
A real one.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.975
Divorced?

18:22.059 --> 18:24.019
Dead.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.317
I'm sorry.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.070
You?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.989
Divorced.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.449
But she wishes
you were dead.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.496
(chuckling)

18:42.579 --> 18:44.039
Yeah, something like that.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.249
{\an1}(chuckles)

18:58.136 --> 19:00.013
What are you thinking?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.225
I am thinking that

19:03.308 --> 19:07.229
{\an3}if even half of what
you're saying is true,

19:07.312 --> 19:10.232
then it's no wonder that...

19:10.315 --> 19:12.067
That I ended up
in Crazy Acres.

19:12.150 --> 19:16.113
{\an3}That you...

19:16.196 --> 19:19.074
that you need a rest.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.877
All right.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.296
{\an3}Listen, I hate to be
that guy, but...

19:41.430 --> 19:42.514
Whoa.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.726
{\an3}(groans):
Whoa... What the,

19:45.809 --> 19:48.562
{\an3}what the, what the
hell did you do?

20:01.658 --> 20:03.160
{\an3}JULIE: This is a
glorified smoke test.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.120
{\an3}We're gonna see some
basic physical functions,

20:05.203 --> 20:07.456
{\an3}simple locomotive
movements and speech.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.124
I promise you,
she won't catch fire.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.127
All the more advanced processes
take a little bit more time.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.295
I understand.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.713
Show me.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.471
She's beautiful.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.514
John made her
in the image of his wife.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.266
{\an1}We've ported the most
recent program

20:26.350 --> 20:27.809
{\an1}from her incubation
server,

20:27.893 --> 20:30.979
which means we get to see
Lucy experience the world

20:31.063 --> 20:32.814
{\an1}in a three-dimensional,
corporeal form

20:32.898 --> 20:34.441
for the first time.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.610
{\an1}All we have to do
is to power her up.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.404
{\an1}So without
further ado...

20:39.488 --> 20:41.031
Charlie?

20:41.114 --> 20:43.533
Yep.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.162
CHARLIE:
Three... two...

20:47.245 --> 20:48.830
one.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.804
{\an1}Lucy...

21:03.887 --> 21:05.472
This is Julie.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.140
Hello, Julie.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.644
You have a body now.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.980
Can you sit up?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.361
(chuckles)
Takes a little getting used to.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.571
{\an3}ANNA:
That's great.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.281
I'd love to see her stand.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.616
Uh, we weren't prepared
to make that...

21:24.700 --> 21:26.576
Tell her to stand.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.329
Can you stand?

21:44.469 --> 21:46.888
(laughs)

21:46.972 --> 21:49.182
{\an3}You made it.
(laughs)

21:49.266 --> 21:50.934
Welcome to the world.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.936
Thank you, Julie.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.612
{\an1}Charlie?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.197
Hey.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.450
Uh, nice to meet you.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.868
But... we know each other.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.161
{\an3}Right, no.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.038
I-I know.
It's just seeing you...

22:11.121 --> 22:13.123
so mature.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.891
(explosion on game)

22:30.974 --> 22:33.602
(bones crackling)
Aah! Aah! Let go!

22:33.685 --> 22:35.145
(grunts)

22:35.228 --> 22:37.481
(Charlie panting)

22:45.072 --> 22:48.075
(beeps, clicks)

22:49.534 --> 22:50.577
Zoe!
(gasps)

22:50.660 --> 22:51.870
Leave me alone

22:51.953 --> 22:53.080
or I swear I will scream!

22:53.163 --> 22:54.122
I'm not here to hurt you.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.499
I'm here to help.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.751
I know what's happening to you.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.127
That you're seeing things.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.962
Things that you
can't explain.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.464
{\an3}Right?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.466
Strange patterns
on different parts of your body.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.301
People that have died.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.303
I know this because

23:08.386 --> 23:09.930
it happened to me, too.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.140
Please, Zoe...

23:12.224 --> 23:14.309
{\an3}talk to me.

23:14.392 --> 23:18.146
{\an5}VELEZ:
I just wanted you to know
that Richter fellow--

23:18.230 --> 23:21.942
patrol special, dishonorable
discharge from Second Kuwait.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.611
Our trackers show they went
to her apartment together.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.446
Nothing out of the ordinary.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.491
He's due to bring her back
in the next 72 hours or so.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.619
{\an3}Maybe it was just
a... conjugal visit.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.704
{\an3}(chuckles)

23:35.914 --> 23:37.374
What's wrong?

23:37.457 --> 23:40.794
{\an1}I got the updated assessment
from Taylor.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.546
{\an1}I asked him what to do
about the target.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.047
And?

23:46.633 --> 23:49.136
He's recommended
a drone strike.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.387
It's the only way
to take him out.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.347
On American soil?

23:52.430 --> 23:54.516
What about civilian casualties?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.768
Well, he's prepared to accept.
Are you?

23:59.229 --> 24:02.899
I can't send another team
to the slaughter.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.819
The other programs
aren't ready so...

24:05.902 --> 24:08.405
we're out of options.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.825
Set up a control center
for the strike.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.493
Yes, sir.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.871
Shayna?

24:18.415 --> 24:20.584
I shouldn't have snapped
at you about Molly.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.918
I'm sorry.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.671
No, don't be.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.256
To be honest, I am not sure

24:26.339 --> 24:27.841
if it was your girlfriend asking

24:27.924 --> 24:29.509
or your chief of staff.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.262
{\an1}Either way,
the answer is the same.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.597
It's not a soft spot.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.140
It's just history.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.439
Good.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.279
{\an1}I started going
back to Reverie--

24:49.362 --> 24:51.072
the VR where we met.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.034
I wasn't looking to cheat.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.745
It seemed harmless enough, but

24:56.828 --> 24:58.872
then I stared spending more time

24:58.955 --> 25:00.957
in my fantasy relationships

25:01.041 --> 25:03.460
than in my real one and...

25:03.543 --> 25:06.421
we split up for a while.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.259
Mike doesn't know
he's not the father.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.303
Who is the father?

25:15.889 --> 25:18.266
{\an1}There were
a few one-night stands.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.311
I'm not proud of it.

25:21.394 --> 25:25.315
What's wrong with my baby?

25:25.398 --> 25:30.445
It's... it-it's like
it's carrying a virus.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.948
And it affects the fetus.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.451
And the mother.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.497
But it happened to you
and you're alive.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.748
{\an3}Yeah.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.792
But my baby was
extracted from me

25:43.875 --> 25:45.710
before it reached full term.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.295
"Extracted"?

25:47.379 --> 25:50.465
Did-did it survive?

25:56.012 --> 25:58.765
{\an1}I can't terminate
this pregnancy. I can't.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.100
(sniffs)

26:00.183 --> 26:02.811
It-it brought Mike
and I back together.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.813
This baby won't be healthy.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.357
You have to listen to me.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.817
(cell phone ringing)

26:08.900 --> 26:10.318
(crying):
I'm sorry, it's Mike.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.404
I'm sorry, I have to go.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.656
Zoe, you are gonna die!

26:14.739 --> 26:16.658
Hey, you didn't pay for those!

26:16.741 --> 26:17.701
{\an1}Don't touch me!
Ma'am!

26:17.784 --> 26:18.702
I swear I'll call the cops!

26:18.785 --> 26:20.245
I said don't touch me!

26:23.581 --> 26:25.875
Zoe, wait!

26:25.959 --> 26:27.585

28:36.381 --> 28:37.799
Because you roofied me,
you lunatic!

28:37.882 --> 28:39.592
And clearly you went
on some kind

28:39.676 --> 28:40.802
of midnight hike.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.805
Where did you go, Molly?

28:43.888 --> 28:45.306
Uh...

28:45.390 --> 28:47.475
I went to see Zoe.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.937
{\an1}I told you I was
gonna help her, but...

28:51.020 --> 28:53.189
How did I get back home?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.150
Are you really asking me that?

28:55.233 --> 28:56.526
I don't know.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.986
I woke up from my little nap,

28:58.069 --> 28:59.446
and here you were.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.281
(phone ringing)

29:01.364 --> 29:03.867
Did you take my car?

29:05.243 --> 29:07.620
And my phone.

29:07.704 --> 29:11.166
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
JD, you have two messages.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.460
ZOE: This is Zoe Grant
calling for Dr. Woods.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.920
I can't stop thinking
about what you said.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.297
I lied.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.382
I think I know
who the father is,

29:19.466 --> 29:21.176
and I-I can give you
a description.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.969
But, please, I need your help.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.180
I... I don't want to die.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.682
JULIE:
<i>We doubled up teams</i>

29:27.765 --> 29:29.809
{\an3}to finish the ethical
algorithms in time,

29:29.893 --> 29:32.979
{\an3}which means we skipped over
the physical calibration.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.522
{\an3}When she clamped down
on Charlie's hand,

29:34.606 --> 29:37.150
there was no limit to
the force of her grip.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.568
I take full responsibility
for that oversight.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.487
I'll turn it down
for the next test.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.323
We don't want you
to turn it down.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.158
{\an1}That kind of strength
would be

29:45.241 --> 29:47.410
very valuable to Lucy
in the field.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.329
{\an4}My colleague had
his hand crushed.
True.

29:49.412 --> 29:52.165
But it did open our minds
to new possibilities.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.167
I told you she would
pass as human.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.793
And now I'm asking you for more.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.671
{\an1}We would like this new breed
of Humanichs to be

29:58.755 --> 30:00.924
faster, stronger than we are.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.718
{\an4}That has potential
consequences...
Okay,

30:03.801 --> 30:05.720
Julie, this is the deal
that you made.

30:05.803 --> 30:08.181
Now, you get to continue
your work with Ethan,

30:08.264 --> 30:12.060
but only as long as you deliver
what we need to do ours.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.021
I understand.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.564
Speaking of Ethan,

30:16.648 --> 30:18.525
it seems his behavior
has become an issue.

30:18.608 --> 30:19.901
He's been through a lot.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.361
His father just died.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.446
{\an3}He's never gonna see
his mother again.

30:23.530 --> 30:27.867
{\an3}I think all things considered,
he seems pretty normal.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.702
Normal or not,

30:29.786 --> 30:32.205
if you cannot get him
under control,

30:32.288 --> 30:34.082
we will give him
to someone who can.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.876
No, I...

30:36.960 --> 30:39.254
No, I promise you

30:39.337 --> 30:40.755
he won't be a distraction.

30:40.838 --> 30:42.090
Good.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.884
Julie, you're a brilliant woman.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.388
{\an1}But you've got to get
your program under control.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.723
There is no more room for error.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.184
For either of us.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.650
The target escaped
five months ago.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.902
Been on the run
and growing ever since,

31:02.986 --> 31:04.988
evading every attempt we've made

31:05.071 --> 31:06.990
to capture or kill him.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.118
We thought he was dead until got
up and walked out of a morgue.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.828
We've used an accelerated
aging program

31:11.911 --> 31:14.497
to create an image
of what he looks like now.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.625
And this is
an extraordinary threat,

31:17.709 --> 31:19.586
and it calls
for extraordinary action.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.087
Which is why I've
received authorization

31:21.170 --> 31:22.964
for a drone strike.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.508
I need you to understand...

31:25.592 --> 31:28.177
failure is not an option.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.847
We have to eliminate
the target for good.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.182
MOLLY:
<i>Zoe!</i>

31:33.266 --> 31:35.476
Zoe!

31:35.560 --> 31:37.478
{\an3}Where would
she go?

31:37.562 --> 31:39.606
Try her again.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.482
Zoe!

31:45.528 --> 31:48.281
Straight to message.
Let's try the clinic.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.824
{\an1}Maybe she went
to see her doctor.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.035
What the hell did you
say to her last night?

31:52.118 --> 31:53.953
Same thing I said to her
in her living room.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.039
(cell phone chimes)

31:59.584 --> 32:01.669
One-one-nine-six-four,
passkey: buffalojump.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.671
VAL: You have
an incoming alert.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.715
Fatality just reported.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.175
Victim suffered
a stomach hemorrhage

32:07.258 --> 32:09.636
that has similarities
to case S1-304.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.721
Has the victim been I.D.'d?

32:11.804 --> 32:13.097
Sending data on file.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.768
The victim is Mrs. Zoe Grant.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.397
Charlie, you can't quit; this is
good news-- they're happy.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.650
{\an3}Oh, they're happy
she crushed my hand?

32:23.733 --> 32:26.653
(scoffs) Congratulations on a
job well done, Dr. Frankenstein.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.821
{\an1}I'm sorry-- I'm the boss,
I had to make the call.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.406
The boss of what?

32:30.490 --> 32:32.033
{\an3}Have you even thought about
what we're doing here?

32:32.116 --> 32:34.035
{\an1}Yes-- this project could
save lives, a lot of them.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.703
Well, I'm sure the people

32:35.787 --> 32:37.163
{\an3}who split the atom
said the same thing.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.040
{\an3}Julie, Humanichs was
supposed to be a revolution.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.668
Six months, and all we've done
is turn it into another weapon.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.336
I didn't sign up for this.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.713
{\an4}Well, what about Ethan?
Our work with him
hasn't changed.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.757
{\an3}Everything has changed,
including you.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.759
I can't be part
of it anymore.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.719
(alarm sounds)

32:53.137 --> 32:54.722
CHARLIE:
Ethan's core is overheating.

32:54.806 --> 32:55.723
Where is he?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.225
{\an3}Ethan?!

32:57.308 --> 32:58.226
Ethan!

32:58.309 --> 33:00.103
Julie!

33:01.479 --> 33:03.272
Ethan.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.899
{\an1}What's going on?
What are you doing?

33:07.944 --> 33:09.779
Trying to die.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.915
{\an5}Ethan, please
don't do this.
Talk to me,
Rabbit, please.

33:20.998 --> 33:22.709
I want my mom and dad.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.085
You lied to me.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.878
{\an5}You said I would
see her again.
I know.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.090
{\an1}I'm sorry-- I-I never
meant to hurt you.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.550
{\an5}We're here for
you, buddy.
No, you're not.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.051
If I mess up again,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.053
that lady's gonna take me
away from Julie.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.555
I heard her say it.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.140
{\an3}So that's what she's
holding over you.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.434
{\an3}And Charlie said
he's leaving.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.644
{\an3}So then I won't
have anyone.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.313
I'll never see my parents again,
and I'll never see you again.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.150
{\an3}And I want to cry,
but I can't,

33:47.233 --> 33:49.277
because I'm not human.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.280
{\an3}JULIE:
Ethan, I'm so sorry

33:52.363 --> 33:54.282
about your mom and dad.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.742
I am.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.994
{\an1}I should have
told you everything.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.455
{\an1}And I... I can't change
what's happened.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.417
I can promise you, though,

34:04.500 --> 34:07.795
{\an1}that I will never <i> ever</i> let
anyone take you away from me.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.672
{\an3}They'll have to kill me
to get near to you.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.800
{\an3}I'm dangerous,
even with one arm.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.844
But you're leaving.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.473
I'm not going anywhere.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.266
{\an3}I just said that
because I was angry.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.103
We're family, Ethan.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.649
{\an1}Families get angry
with each other sometimes.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.152
They argue, and...

34:33.780 --> 34:35.864
{\an1}...they say things
they don't mean.

34:35.947 --> 34:37.992
And they make mistakes.

34:41.078 --> 34:43.080
I am so, so sorry.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.168
{\an1}Please, Rabbit,
turn your warmers down.

34:50.295 --> 34:52.672
Come on, buddy.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.849
(Julie and Charlie
sigh with relief)

35:05.478 --> 35:07.188
I love you.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.315
I really, really,
really, really do.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.194
MOLLY:
<i>We can't just give up.</i>

35:13.277 --> 35:14.612
I'm not giving
up, all right?

35:14.695 --> 35:16.155
I've got another body.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.700
{\an3}Look, what I'm
gonna do is just

35:19.784 --> 35:21.702
some good old-fashioned
police work, all right?

35:21.786 --> 35:23.538
{\an3}Because if there's a
serial killer out there,

35:23.621 --> 35:26.207
{\an3}then I-I've wasted too
much time already.

35:26.290 --> 35:30.211
Are you so small-minded that you
can't consider the possibility

35:30.294 --> 35:32.672
{\an1}that there is
something else out there?

35:32.755 --> 35:34.215
{\an3}No, I've considered
it, all right?

35:34.298 --> 35:37.218
But I'm a cop, so
I work with facts.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.220
I work with evidence.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.222
{\an6}I believe in
what I see.
Oh, God.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.725
{\an3}And Molly... Molly,
what I see is...

35:44.809 --> 35:46.727
is someone who
is distraught

35:46.811 --> 35:49.397
{\an3}because they've lost their
husband and their son

35:49.480 --> 35:51.274
{\an3}and who needs rest
desperately.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.733
No, no, but...

35:52.817 --> 35:53.776
{\an1}Molly...
But JD...

35:53.860 --> 35:55.611
{\an3}Molly.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.071
{\an3}Please.

35:57.154 --> 35:58.406
Get your things.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.324
(sighs)

36:01.826 --> 36:03.286
Okay.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.505
No funny business.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.269
Gina, connect me
to Metro-MedNet.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.272
Welcome to Metro-MedNet.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.107
I am not intended
to be a substitute

36:33.190 --> 36:34.609
for professional
medical advice.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.611
Okay, look, I am
really sick here.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.946
Something is happening to me,
and I think I'm going crazy.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.781
{\an1}What are
your symptoms?

36:40.865 --> 36:43.284
{\an3}Well, I started off
with severe migraines.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.286
{\an3}Mood swings,
unusual appetite.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.913
{\an3}And now it's
getting worse.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.290
{\an3}And my skin is burning, and
it's itching like crazy.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.625
{\an3}And I'm having
voices in my head.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.627
{\an3}And I'm starting
to black out.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.962
And I'm ending up in places that
I have no idea how I got there.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.464
When did this begin?

36:56.547 --> 36:57.965
When I got home from space.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.967
I'm-I'm an astronaut.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.471
Do you think this could be,
I don't know, schizophrenia?

37:03.554 --> 37:05.473
{\an3}Or cosmic radiation
poisoning?

37:05.556 --> 37:07.350
{\an1}Cosmic Radiation
Syndrome

37:07.433 --> 37:10.144
is a rare neurodegenerative
disease brought on

37:10.228 --> 37:11.479
by prolonged exposure

37:11.562 --> 37:12.813
{\an1}to high-mass,
high-charged particles

37:12.897 --> 37:14.815
found only in space.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.151
Symptoms can include
those you've described.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.487
What's the prognosis?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.113
{\an1}The patient's mental state
may deteriorate,

37:21.197 --> 37:23.658
resulting in aggression
and confusion.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.661
In extreme cases, this can lead
to paranoid delusions,

37:26.744 --> 37:28.496
{\an1}psychosis
and suicide.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.998
{\an1}If you're experiencing any
of these symptoms, please...

37:31.082 --> 37:33.125
Cancel.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.713
{\an3}I'm sorry I
ruined the test.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.382
There will be other tests.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.385
{\an3}I don't know why I keep
doing these things.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.804
Because you're hurting.

37:44.887 --> 37:47.223
{\an1}It's what humans do when we've
been through something sad,

37:47.306 --> 37:50.184
we do things to try
and stop the pain.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.729
{\an3}Well, if this is what pain
feels like for humans...

37:55.648 --> 37:57.692
{\an3}...I don't want to
feel it anymore.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.157
Ethan, what if...

38:14.125 --> 38:16.168
{\an1}What if I could
take it away?

38:27.179 --> 38:29.223
Do you trust me?

38:33.853 --> 38:36.564
