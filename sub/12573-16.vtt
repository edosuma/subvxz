WEBVTT

00:01.115 --> 00:02.215
My Lord.

00:02.268 --> 00:03.735
My Lord, we've done it.

00:04.222 --> 00:06.011
We've located the third box of Orden.

00:06.703 --> 00:07.598
Where?

00:08.071 --> 00:10.566
The tracer cloud has come to rest
over the plains of Morrow.

00:11.337 --> 00:13.531
So close to the People's Palace.

00:14.217 --> 00:17.556
The wizard is being arms,
perhaps on some kind of ploy.

00:17.865 --> 00:21.596
No doubt Zeddicus is using magic
to protect the box somehow.

00:27.446 --> 00:28.756
[incantation]

00:31.973 --> 00:36.420
Send a battalion to the Plains of Morrow.
Tell them to find the box at any cost.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.458
Yes My Lord, at once.

00:40.333 --> 00:43.120
Egremont, do you remember
your D'Haran history?

00:43.471 --> 00:44.203
My Lord?

00:44.639 --> 00:46.509
The battle at the Plains of Morrow,

00:46.559 --> 00:49.838
the turning point of the
Great Wizard War 3000 years ago.

00:50.068 --> 00:52.191
I studied it in my youth, My Lord.

00:52.522 --> 00:59.022
But do you know why to this day the grass
on the plains of Morrow is always green

00:59.115 --> 01:02.953
in all seasons,
through blizzard and drought?

01:03.875 --> 01:09.443
Because it grows in the bones and blood
of the wizards massacred in the battle.

01:09.882 --> 01:14.093
Zeddicus must be using their magic
to shield the box somehow.

01:14.653 --> 01:17.000
Whoever finds the Box of Orden

01:17.050 --> 01:19.646
will be honored and rewarded
by Lord Rahl himself.

01:27.165 --> 01:29.965
[screaming]

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.030 --> 01:46.276
Would anyone else like to
walk away from their duty?

01:48.819 --> 01:50.489
Find the Box of Orden!

01:50.631 --> 01:53.345
For Darken Rahl and D'Hara!

01:59.246 --> 02:03.046
[groaning and screaming]

02:04.263 --> 02:07.134
Legend of the Seeker S01E16
"Bloodline"

02:16.402 --> 02:17.887
What are you doing?

02:18.350 --> 02:20.097
Oh, I thought you wanted me
to keep you in shape.

02:25.167 --> 02:26.693
I didn't say "kill me."

02:27.306 --> 02:29.867
If I got that close to killing you,
apparently you need to practice.

02:43.070 --> 02:45.661
I leave for a fortnight and you two
are at each other's throats.

02:46.194 --> 02:47.686
Zedd.

02:49.685 --> 02:51.635
One more day and we were
gonna go looking for you.

02:53.934 --> 02:55.191
Where have you been?

02:55.429 --> 02:59.755
Disposing of the box,
which is at long last safely hidden.

03:00.074 --> 03:00.590
Where?

03:00.590 --> 03:01.760
Under Rahl's nose.

03:02.072 --> 03:05.025
Surrounded by seven concentric
walls of lethal magic.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.446
Eventually, his lordship will run out
of men to fling against my fortification

03:09.556 --> 03:12.471
and go after the box himself.

03:13.058 --> 03:13.911
And when he does...

03:14.459 --> 03:16.229
He'll wish he hadn't.

03:42.761 --> 03:43.872
Denna.

03:46.288 --> 03:47.285
My Lord.

03:47.702 --> 03:49.777
Why do you make me hurt you like this?

03:51.169 --> 03:53.147
I'm sorry I failed you, My Lord.

03:53.897 --> 03:55.865
So you've claimed many times.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.453
But the fact remains you let
the Seeker slip from your grasp.

04:01.853 --> 04:05.205
I deserve my punishment and more.

04:15.783 --> 04:20.993
Release me and I'll show you such
pleasure that all will be forgiven.

04:21.244 --> 04:23.083
Pleasure alas must wait.

04:24.769 --> 04:27.451
I've learned the exact location
of the third Box of Orden.

04:27.812 --> 04:29.949
But my men have failed to retrieve it.

04:30.544 --> 04:34.035
Send me , I will succeed.

04:34.783 --> 04:37.953
I should never have sent men
to do a Morth Sith's job.

04:41.741 --> 04:45.235
But you would not want
to disappoint me again, Denna.

04:48.335 --> 04:50.231
I will return with the box.

04:53.065 --> 04:54.048
Yes ..

04:59.889 --> 05:01.860
But you won't be able to do it alone.

05:04.296 --> 05:10.808
First you need to capture the one
person that I fear most in the world.

05:12.939 --> 05:15.215
The Seeker will not escape me again.

05:17.045 --> 05:18.480
No, no, no.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.315
Someone far more fearsome than he.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.700
[goat bleating]

05:30.113 --> 05:32.313
[woman screaming]

05:36.613 --> 05:38.513
[sound of the Morth Sith pain stick]

05:38.740 --> 05:39.508
Mother!

05:40.541 --> 05:41.548
Hello Jennsen.

05:45.092 --> 05:50.773
I'm sorry I had to hurt your mother,
but I'm here on extremely important business.

05:50.843 --> 05:53.528
Important to the peace and
happiness of the whole world

05:54.606 --> 05:57.853
and I need to be sure
that I can count on your help.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.632
Let her go. Please.

06:01.329 --> 06:07.317
First I need you to do something
for me and for Lord Rahl.

06:07.317 --> 06:09.906
Jennsen, no. Whatever she asks, don't--

06:15.960 --> 06:19.086
I really hope you don't make me
kill your mother, Jennsen.

06:22.406 --> 06:26.184
Somewhere in this field
is a jeweled box. Find it.

06:29.739 --> 06:31.403
Why do I need a shovel?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.303
You can see it?

06:38.392 --> 06:41.972
A wizard made it invisible,
it's been right here all along.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.498
Bring it to me.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.989
These men ... What happened to them?

06:47.815 --> 06:50.827
Killed by the wizard's magic
when they tried to retrieve the box.

06:52.139 --> 06:54.606
Well, then, 
how am I supposed to get it?

06:57.269 --> 06:58.963
You never told her.

06:59.236 --> 07:00.347
Told me what?

07:00.452 --> 07:05.007
Forgive me, Jennsen. I ... was hoping
you would never have to know.

07:05.414 --> 07:09.170
Allow me, Jennsen,
to be the one to show you

07:09.220 --> 07:12.889
how very far from ordinary
you really are.

07:24.118 --> 07:26.485
Once every generation or so,

07:26.535 --> 07:31.380
a child is born upon whom magic
has no effect whatsoever.

07:32.510 --> 07:35.847
You are a very special girl, Jennsen.
Now get me the box.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.239
Let my mother go.

07:56.289 --> 08:00.005
When she has a head start,
I will give you the box.

08:02.953 --> 08:05.845
Do you think you're in a position
to negotiate with me?

08:06.730 --> 08:08.030
No!!

08:09.393 --> 08:10.452
Take it, please.

08:10.752 --> 08:12.013
I'm sorry.

08:17.102 --> 08:17.944
What is that?

08:18.663 --> 08:24.527
A magical alarm, in case someone
somehow managed to get the box.

08:25.027 --> 08:26.618
How could anyone have broken your magic?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.863
Brilliant, the wizard
put a signal spell on it.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.195
No doubt he's already racing this way
with the Seeker and the confessor.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.928
I did what you wanted. Please let us go.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.794
Oh, no, I can't let you go, Jennsen.

08:43.845 --> 08:48.215
No, I need you to carry that box
to the People's Palace yourself.

08:48.536 --> 08:50.682
I can't get it there safely without you.

08:51.022 --> 08:52.976
Jennsen, no. Don't help her.

08:53.026 --> 08:54.173
Let her kill me.

08:59.963 --> 09:01.350
Look at them, Jennsen.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.480
Look!

09:04.712 --> 09:08.920
Did the wizard give a thought to the
innocent men he would brutally slaughter?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.082
To their fatherless children?

09:12.533 --> 09:13.433
No.

09:13.533 --> 09:18.826
No, he thought only of protecting the
treasure which he stole from Darken Rahl

09:18.980 --> 09:21.458
who seeks only to spread peace
throughout the Midlands.

09:21.458 --> 09:22.890
She's lying to you!

09:22.990 --> 09:24.426
Ask yourself, Jennsen.

09:24.582 --> 09:26.478
Which of us is really the liar here?

09:27.092 --> 09:31.234
Why has your mother hidden your powers
from you all these years?

09:31.961 --> 09:36.744
Why has she hidden you
like some dirty, shameful secret?

09:40.786 --> 09:44.568
Darken Rahl has dreamed of universal
peace ever since he was a little boy.

09:44.937 --> 09:47.345
But now the Seeker has
returned to the Midlands

09:47.395 --> 09:49.958
and is relentlessly trying
to destroy that dream. 

09:50.502 --> 09:52.388
You never told me any of this.

09:52.479 --> 09:55.020
But Lord Rahl knows that
the Seeker is only a puppet

09:55.070 --> 09:58.458
dancing on strings jerked this way
and that by a wizard.

09:59.253 --> 10:01.088
In his wisdom and his mercy,

10:01.526 --> 10:04.040
Lord Rahl sent me to offer
the Seeker a chance

10:04.090 --> 10:07.708
to stand at his side and declare
peace throughout the territories.

10:08.905 --> 10:12.002
And do you know how
the Seeker greeted this offer?

10:13.417 --> 10:16.236
He ran me through with the Sword of Lies,

10:16.286 --> 10:17.974
and left me for dead.

10:18.654 --> 10:20.469
You told me the Seeker was a hero.

10:20.769 --> 10:22.403
He <i>is</i> a hero.

10:23.495 --> 10:25.597
Why lie to me about who I am?

10:25.989 --> 10:28.935
You've seen what a monster this woman is.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.416
How can you believe one word she says?

10:32.725 --> 10:35.593
I don't know who the monster is.

10:35.643 --> 10:38.330
I don't know anything anymore.

10:47.905 --> 10:49.205
Jennsen?

10:53.095 --> 10:54.862
Get it back.

10:56.622 --> 10:57.976
There.

11:01.751 --> 11:03.051
No!

11:03.950 --> 11:06.545
I underestimated you, Jennsen.

11:06.995 --> 11:12.030
But not as tragically as you
have underestimated me.

11:19.652 --> 11:21.314
Please, stop!

11:21.364 --> 11:24.541
I'm the one who threw the box!

11:24.591 --> 11:25.633
Punish me!

11:29.447 --> 11:32.247
[mother screaming in agony]

11:37.029 --> 11:38.028
Denna.

11:38.878 --> 11:40.560
She's alive.

11:41.541 --> 11:43.341
[screaming continues]

11:47.910 --> 11:50.480
She's holding the Agiel
and it does not hurt her.

11:50.530 --> 11:51.670
How could she do that?

11:52.077 --> 11:55.850
'cause she is pristinely ungifted.

11:56.151 --> 11:57.337
Stay back.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.131
That's the other side of your gift.

12:07.114 --> 12:11.884
Not only can't you be harmed by magic
but you can't use it either.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.342
You have a lot to learn
about yourself, Jennsen.

12:15.684 --> 12:19.178
Pristinely ungifted are
entirely immune to magic.

12:19.728 --> 12:22.616
They rarely survive past childhood.

12:22.870 --> 12:23.911
RICHARD: Why not?

12:24.045 --> 12:27.436
For generations,
the House of Rahl has found them

12:27.486 --> 12:29.344
and murdered them at birth.

12:30.577 --> 12:31.602
Why?

12:31.687 --> 12:34.908
Because Rahl's magic can't
hurt them or enslave them.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.189
What would be more dangerous to him?

12:39.456 --> 12:41.590
Mistress, I have the box.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.370
Bind her hands and tie them
both to the horse.

12:46.931 --> 12:51.295
And hurry. If the wizard and his friends
haven't already found us, they soon will.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.273
Defend the box.

13:09.696 --> 13:11.917
You look like you've seen a ghost.

14:01.643 --> 14:02.843
Run.

14:12.609 --> 14:13.652
Let me go.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.030
I have to help my mother

14:15.030 --> 14:15.925
We will, we will,

14:15.975 --> 14:18.136
as soon as we get the box
as far away from Denna as we can.

14:18.338 --> 14:20.485
If it will save my mother,
I will give it to her.

14:21.049 --> 14:23.657
If Darken Rahl gets this box,
we will all be slaves.

14:23.707 --> 14:27.193
Everybody in the world, and your mother
would be as good as dead anyway.

14:27.193 --> 14:30.269
I don't even know you.
Why should I listen to you?

14:31.082 --> 14:32.719
Because he is the Seeker.

14:37.271 --> 14:39.166
If you are the Seeker,

14:39.216 --> 14:43.904
then that woman Denna is torturing
is your mother too.

14:50.756 --> 14:55.657
I was born three years after
the massacre at Brennidon. 

14:55.707 --> 15:02.455
My mother, our mother held me in her arms
for eight days after I was born.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.331
Because she was afraid I would be
taken away from her like you were.

15:08.544 --> 15:11.668
She's still afraid to
let me out of her sight.

15:11.718 --> 15:15.833
Every year she lights
candles for your birthday,

15:16.183 --> 15:18.471
imagined what you look like,

15:19.221 --> 15:21.954
how tall you are,
if you have freckles ...

15:23.939 --> 15:25.906
Zedd, you knew my mother.

15:25.956 --> 15:27.763
Could it really be her?

15:28.315 --> 15:29.379
Yes.

15:30.226 --> 15:31.825
Then...

15:34.188 --> 15:35.679
Then what?

15:43.410 --> 15:44.577
I am not here to fight.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.880
I am here to deliver a message
from Mistress Denna.

15:47.382 --> 15:49.865
She holds the girl's mother
at the Cave of Sorrows.

15:49.915 --> 15:52.063
You bring the box, or she dies.

15:52.113 --> 15:53.680
You have until nightfall.

15:57.448 --> 15:59.137
We have to go, now.

15:59.288 --> 16:04.296
I'm sorry, child, but we cannot forfeit
the final Box of Orden for one person's life.

16:04.436 --> 16:06.341
That's easy for you to say.

16:07.391 --> 16:09.046
She's not your mother.

16:09.503 --> 16:10.813
No,

16:11.963 --> 16:13.748
she's my daughter.

16:20.504 --> 16:21.609
Yes.

16:24.694 --> 16:27.033
I am your grandfather.

16:30.678 --> 16:33.431
And apparently yours as well, child.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.452
All this time...

16:52.202 --> 16:54.367
and you never told me?

16:54.885 --> 16:59.350
I was afraid that some day you might have
to choose between your mission and family.

17:03.184 --> 17:05.463
I never wanted to put you on that position.

17:08.479 --> 17:09.907
Did you know?

17:10.267 --> 17:11.826
I wanted to tell you.

17:11.826 --> 17:14.135
I asked her not to.

17:17.432 --> 17:18.741
What am I to you two?

17:19.991 --> 17:22.083
Just a pair of hands
to hold the Sword of Truth

17:22.233 --> 17:24.656
and fulfill your precious prophecy?

17:27.386 --> 17:28.613
Who's our father?

17:28.613 --> 17:29.723
I don't know.

17:29.846 --> 17:32.071
I don't even know
if we have the same one.

17:32.516 --> 17:34.385
Every time I tried to talk about it,

17:34.436 --> 17:37.610
mother got so angry and sad,
so I finally stopped asking.

17:39.645 --> 17:40.920
I'm going after her.

17:40.970 --> 17:42.138
Richard, wait!

17:42.138 --> 17:43.977
For what? There's no time.

17:44.984 --> 17:46.043
I'll give Denna the box, 

17:46.093 --> 17:47.144
I'll get Taralynn saved,

17:47.194 --> 17:49.154
and I will follow Denna
and get the box back

17:49.204 --> 17:50.577
before she delivers it to Rahl.

17:50.577 --> 17:52.393
And if you do not catch her in time?

17:52.482 --> 17:53.857
How can you just stand there

17:53.907 --> 17:56.683
and let your own daughter
being tortured by a Mord Sith?

17:57.316 --> 18:00.822
Your mother gave up her
firstborn child for a reason.

18:00.872 --> 18:05.604
She knew that you were born to stop
Rahl from enslaving the world.

18:06.115 --> 18:09.780
She knew that you had to
survive no matter what.

18:10.732 --> 18:12.512
If you let Rahl get the box,

18:12.562 --> 18:16.148
then your mother's sacrifice
will have been for nothing.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.472
That's not gonna happen.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.605
I can't let you leave with the box.

18:22.109 --> 18:24.886
What are you gonna do?
Cook me with Wizard's Fire?

18:25.586 --> 18:27.800
I would never hurt you.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.853
I'm just going to stop you.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.587
Come on.

18:39.824 --> 18:42.281
You can't stop Richard
if I'm with him, can you?

18:46.789 --> 18:49.245
You can come and or you can stay.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.678
Either way, we're gonna save our mother.

19:07.384 --> 19:08.634
You alright?

19:09.024 --> 19:11.235
Yeah..ugh!

19:16.206 --> 19:17.018
It's sprained.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.553
You're not going
anywhere until I bind it.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.679
Let me help.

19:22.213 --> 19:24.145
Your magic can't heal her.

19:30.398 --> 19:33.594
She must think her grandfather's
cold-hearted bastard.

19:36.261 --> 19:38.006
Someday she'll understand.

19:39.257 --> 19:41.546
What if there is no someday, Kahlan?

19:41.596 --> 19:44.697
You have to convince Richard
to stop this madness.

19:46.012 --> 19:49.119
You're the one who's always saying
that we have to trust the Seeker's instincts.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.637
This is different.
This is his mother.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.598
When he sees her being tortured,

19:54.648 --> 19:57.584
I fear he's going to throw the box
to Denna just to make her stop.

19:58.684 --> 20:03.101
Are you worried that Richard's
going to do that, or that you are?

20:04.275 --> 20:06.221
Richard, Denna is gonna be ready for us.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.386
She's going to have more soldiers.
How can we fight her?

20:10.864 --> 20:15.894
Over the past few months,
I've been attacked by flying monsters,

20:15.944 --> 20:17.959
tracked by bounty hunters,

20:18.009 --> 20:21.908
tortured by Denna and
beaten bloody by Darken Rahl himself.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.586
I'm still here.

20:23.888 --> 20:26.167
All in one piece, I think.

20:27.619 --> 20:29.174
I see it now.

20:29.834 --> 20:30.752
What?

20:30.831 --> 20:35.200
When you smile, right around the eyes,
you look just like our mother.

20:40.816 --> 20:42.142
Try that.

20:44.997 --> 20:46.197
Ooff...

20:48.071 --> 20:49.908
If the box can do what you say,

20:49.958 --> 20:53.116
give Darken Rahl power over
the whole world, then ...

20:54.438 --> 20:57.331
I don't think our mother would want us
to trade it for her life.

21:00.110 --> 21:01.815
Can you think of another way?

21:04.263 --> 21:08.300
If this cave has some kind of magic
around it, I can get through that.

21:08.541 --> 21:10.174
You should be ready for that.

21:12.397 --> 21:17.276
There might be a way,
but it will all depend on you.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.164
Anything.

21:20.658 --> 21:22.033
DENNA: Where is the box?

21:22.083 --> 21:23.186
I don't have it with me.

21:23.186 --> 21:24.900
Do you think I'm playing games?

21:25.836 --> 21:28.200
Bring it to me or I'll kill her.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.912
Go ahead.

21:32.689 --> 21:35.981
Then go back to Rahl and explain
to him how you've failed him.

21:38.411 --> 21:43.021
I'm guessing that whatever punishment
you've endured for letting me escape

21:43.071 --> 21:47.742
is going to seem like a pinprick
compared to what he'll do to you this time.

21:48.277 --> 21:51.530
You won't let an innocent person die.

21:51.650 --> 21:53.603
I'm not as soft-hearted
as I used to be, Denna.

21:54.572 --> 21:56.129
Not since I met you.

21:56.621 --> 21:59.175
So I will let this woman
die in a heartbeat

21:59.283 --> 22:01.381
if it keeps Rahl from
getting all three boxes.

22:02.217 --> 22:06.756
But... there is a way
we can both get what we want.

22:08.473 --> 22:10.065
I'm listening.

22:11.514 --> 22:13.362
First we put down our weapons.

22:34.805 --> 22:36.566
The only bargain I'll consider

22:36.616 --> 22:40.816
is the one that ends with me handing
the third Box of Orden to Darken Rahl.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.945
I'll give you the third box.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.458
After you'll help us
to steal the other two.

22:49.443 --> 22:50.516
Impossible.

22:50.598 --> 22:53.418
You know your way in and out
of the People's Palace, don't you?

22:53.518 --> 22:56.294
I know the place better
than he does, but...

22:56.444 --> 22:59.439
I am not foolish enough
to try stealing the boxes.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.399
I'm not asking you to.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.331
But if you know the Palace
as well as you say,

23:04.881 --> 23:08.249
then you know about all the magical
barriers Rahl uses to protect it.

23:10.216 --> 23:15.834
You believe the pristinely ungifted one
can get past Rahl's magical barriers.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.678
No!
[soldier grunting]

23:18.431 --> 23:22.361
Well, it's suicide,
but if you hand me the box,

23:22.411 --> 23:25.500
I'll draw a treasure map for Jennsen.

23:25.554 --> 23:28.924
No. You draw the map,
Jennsen brings back the first two boxes,

23:28.974 --> 23:30.627
<i>then</i> we give you the third.

23:30.727 --> 23:33.148
And what if Rahl suspects
that I helped you?

23:33.597 --> 23:36.198
If you don't return with the third box,
he's going to kill you anyway.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.637
So I would say it's a risk worth taking.

23:38.965 --> 23:43.615
Once you have all the boxes,
how do I know you'll give me the third?

23:51.214 --> 23:53.127
Because you have Jennsen's mother.

23:56.378 --> 23:58.332
This woman is very important to you,

23:59.282 --> 24:00.777
isn't she, Richard?

24:02.460 --> 24:06.304
Like you said, I'd rather not
let an innocent person die.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.562
Do we have a deal?

24:26.058 --> 24:27.972
Shall we seal it with a kiss?

24:37.314 --> 24:39.987
Kill me, and I can never revive her!

24:43.154 --> 24:44.680
I'll give her the Breath of Life

24:44.830 --> 24:47.274
if you bring me the third Box of Orden

24:47.324 --> 24:50.287
by the time the rising sun
is full in the sky.

24:55.139 --> 24:56.551
You two stay here and protect the box.

24:56.601 --> 24:59.308
Jennssen and I are going to the Palace.
Nothing has changed.

24:59.446 --> 25:01.401
Everything has changed.

25:02.125 --> 25:05.632
Denna has proven  - as if proof was needed -
that she cannot be trusted.

25:06.399 --> 25:10.163
You said if Darken Rahl got all three boxes,
he'd have power over everyone.

25:11.003 --> 25:13.220
Could anyone who had
the boxes use that magic?

25:13.784 --> 25:19.023
Yes. Whoever puts all three boxes together has
instant and absolute control over everybody.

25:19.592 --> 25:21.664
What he commands is done.

25:22.061 --> 25:24.185
If I get the other two boxes
out of the palace,

25:24.235 --> 25:26.822
Richard could put them
together and command Denna

25:26.872 --> 25:28.926
to give our mother this Breath of Life.

25:29.788 --> 25:31.842
The magic of Orden is too dangerous.

25:32.701 --> 25:35.770
It would intoxicate whoever wielded it,
corrupt him.

25:35.936 --> 25:37.585
Then we go ahead with the deal.

25:37.585 --> 25:38.673
No.

25:39.613 --> 25:43.814
We grieve for Taralynn, get Jennsen and
the box as far away from here as possible.

25:44.133 --> 25:46.282
Denna still needs us as much as we need her.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.644
She knows she won't get the box
if we don't get Taralynn alive.

25:51.256 --> 25:54.028
You would send your sister
into the belly of the beast?

25:54.843 --> 25:57.039
You would leave your daughter to die?

25:57.839 --> 25:58.558
Yes.

25:59.409 --> 26:01.303
Yes, I would.

26:03.707 --> 26:10.973
Jennsen, dear one, for 23 years I built walls
against the pain of losing your mother.

26:11.677 --> 26:14.685
And now with you before me,
all those walls are crumbling.

26:16.571 --> 26:18.882
I've only just found out
I have a granddaughter.

26:18.947 --> 26:21.113
I can't bear the thought of losing her, too.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.792
You won't lose me, grandfather.

26:31.173 --> 26:36.047
DENNA: The People's Palace is surrounded by
a tree line that acts as a magical barrier.

26:36.445 --> 26:39.642
Only those who have been spelled
by Rahl's sorcerers

26:39.692 --> 26:43.606
can pass in and out of the barrier
without being instantly killed by it.

26:44.854 --> 26:47.448
Richard will have to wait
for you on the other side.

26:50.268 --> 26:53.216
There will be alarms,
but you won't set them off.

26:53.670 --> 26:57.287
Just make sure the archers patrolling
the battlements don't see you.

26:57.865 --> 26:59.923
They shoot on sight.

27:01.704 --> 27:06.272
There is a secret entrance on the South end
of the palace that leads to an escape tunnel.

27:06.823 --> 27:11.974
As Lord Rahl's personal bodyguard,
only the Mord Sith know of its existence.

27:12.814 --> 27:17.270
You'll see the opening,
but make sure no one is watching you.

27:17.523 --> 27:22.096
Because what they will see is
someone walking through a solid wall.

27:25.183 --> 27:27.676
Follow the tunnel to the staircase.

27:30.328 --> 27:34.094
At the top is a archway
guarded by a lone sentry.

27:35.633 --> 27:38.192
He passes every ninety seconds.

27:39.877 --> 27:41.232
Wait until he goes by,

27:41.282 --> 27:45.835
and then run straight ahead to the
entrance to Rahl's ceremonial chamber.

27:49.941 --> 27:54.509
Rahl trusts no one, so there are no
living guards watching over the chamber itself.

27:55.134 --> 27:57.193
It's protected only by magic.

27:59.016 --> 28:02.882
The final magical shield,
the one closest to the boxes,

28:02.932 --> 28:05.241
allows only Rahl himself to get through.

28:06.177 --> 28:09.130
Of course, you're the exception.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.620
But be careful.

28:27.907 --> 28:31.392
Even if you make it past all
the shields and guards,

28:31.442 --> 28:36.052
Darken Rahl has an uncanny ability
to sense when things are awry.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.547
Lord Rahl, Mistress Denna has
sent word by journeybook. 

28:44.597 --> 28:46.457
She'll arrive by nightfall tomorrow

28:47.130 --> 28:49.040
with the third Box of Orden.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.852
Tell her she will be greeted with the
strumming of harps and the blast of trumpets.

28:54.071 --> 28:55.010
You doubt her, My Lord?

28:55.288 --> 28:57.884
I doubt the very sun at noon, Egremont.

29:22.593 --> 29:23.762
JENNSEN: Zedd, Kahlan!

29:23.812 --> 29:24.764
We have the boxes!

29:25.893 --> 29:27.293
Thank the spirits.

29:30.012 --> 29:31.903
I was caught in a room with Rahl.

29:31.966 --> 29:33.604
I was this close to him.

29:34.336 --> 29:37.295
He picked up the boxes,
he held them, he caressed them.

29:37.793 --> 29:40.963
Imagine his surprise the next time
he drops in to play with his toys.

29:42.287 --> 29:43.295
Look!

29:45.470 --> 29:47.529
We have to give the third box to Denna.

29:48.060 --> 29:49.699
It's right here.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.445
Welcome back, Seeker.

29:58.987 --> 30:01.277
You've succeeded... of course.

30:02.618 --> 30:04.545
I thought we had a deal.

30:05.251 --> 30:06.875
I've changed my mind.

30:07.123 --> 30:11.047
I've decided I want all three boxes.

30:11.097 --> 30:11.897
Now.

30:13.787 --> 30:16.198
We don't have all three. Only two.

30:17.555 --> 30:19.236
We have hidden the third.

30:20.246 --> 30:25.020
Tell me where it is
or I'll kill your loved ones,

30:25.070 --> 30:26.618
one by one.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.962
And then it'll just be you and me.

30:31.801 --> 30:34.474
Do you think I would ever let you
have the power of Orden?

30:34.734 --> 30:36.150
At any price?

30:36.221 --> 30:40.600
Yes, because you'd rather
I had the power than Rahl.

30:41.982 --> 30:43.507
I'd treat you kindly.

30:43.627 --> 30:45.249
I'd give you whatever you wanted,

30:47.058 --> 30:51.176
or I could take away
what you care about most.

30:51.665 --> 30:53.485
Take the Confessor first.

30:53.766 --> 30:54.991
Wait!

31:17.107 --> 31:21.122
At least grant me the governorship
over to the lands west of the river Dram,

31:21.172 --> 31:23.350
where I can live with my friends in peace.

31:24.046 --> 31:26.948
What better governor could I
ask for than the Seeker?

31:37.087 --> 31:39.288
Then I'll show you where the third box is.

31:41.717 --> 31:43.518
No!

32:10.535 --> 32:11.698
Kill them all!

32:11.848 --> 32:13.232
Stop!

32:17.214 --> 32:19.396
Drop your weapons. All of you.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.173
Take us to our mother.

32:34.463 --> 32:36.204
Yes, My Lord.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.749
[gently blowing]

32:52.041 --> 32:55.222
The sun isn't up yet.
You said you could revive her.

32:55.527 --> 32:58.504
That was before I was
under your command, My Lord.

32:59.260 --> 33:01.197
I lied to you.

33:01.578 --> 33:04.259
I knew she'd never last until sunrise.

33:04.950 --> 33:08.507
I'm sorry, My Lord.
I've failed you.

33:08.590 --> 33:10.390
[whimpering]

33:11.919 --> 33:14.323
Mother...
[crying]

33:18.770 --> 33:20.070
No...

33:26.283 --> 33:28.083
[sobbing]

33:37.523 --> 33:39.583
Richard, I'm so sorry.

33:47.552 --> 33:49.499
What are we going to do with her?

33:54.027 --> 33:55.428
Kill her.

34:04.023 --> 34:05.704
Slowly.

34:10.231 --> 34:12.353
If that is your wish, My Lord.

34:33.435 --> 34:35.149
Richard, no.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.981
Harder.

34:43.570 --> 34:44.969
[Denna groaning]

34:51.893 --> 34:53.092
[gasping]

34:53.485 --> 34:56.049
The way of the Seeker is not vengeance.

34:57.734 --> 35:01.229
Not vengeance, justice.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.691
Are you sure you can tell
one from the other?

35:03.792 --> 35:05.219
You gave me the third box.

35:05.289 --> 35:07.994
To stop Denna from killing us all!

35:08.348 --> 35:10.137
Why should it stop there?

35:10.905 --> 35:12.836
Don't you see what happens now?

35:13.743 --> 35:15.190
Now I go to the People's Palace,

35:16.126 --> 35:19.186
I order Rahl to fall on my sword.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.698
I'll punish the guilty
and liberate the Midlands.

35:23.365 --> 35:25.336
The war is over.

35:26.686 --> 35:28.221
I've won.

35:28.820 --> 35:29.630
Not this way.

35:30.580 --> 35:33.087
You'd only become the very tyrant
who would've killed--

35:33.187 --> 35:35.014
Silence, old man!

35:41.594 --> 35:43.533
You've all killed innocent people.

35:44.874 --> 35:46.759
And now you will kill each other.

35:47.071 --> 35:49.543
Pick up your weapons
and fight to the death.

36:02.351 --> 36:06.351
Zedd, anyone left standing,
burn him to ash.

36:08.911 --> 36:10.690
Yes, My Lord.

36:22.732 --> 36:23.857
Jennsen, no

36:24.991 --> 36:29.378
I may have only just met you, brother,
but I know this isn't you.

36:30.534 --> 36:32.006
Don't touch the boxes.

36:34.432 --> 36:36.438
Magic doesn't work on me.

36:37.023 --> 36:39.065
Not even the magic of Orden.

36:40.956 --> 36:42.456
No!

37:02.279 --> 37:04.322
What did I do?

37:04.322 --> 37:07.333
It wasn't you,
it was the power of Orden.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.695
Richard,

37:12.745 --> 37:14.620
finish me off.

37:15.992 --> 37:18.034
Before Darken Rahl finds me.

37:27.023 --> 37:28.175
No.

37:29.425 --> 37:31.082
Enough killing.

37:31.810 --> 37:32.940
Please.

37:34.373 --> 37:37.565
Leaving me to Darken Rahl
is worse than killing me.

37:52.994 --> 37:55.111
Then I suggest you run.

38:10.071 --> 38:12.700
You can't come with us, Jennsen.

38:13.350 --> 38:14.901
It's too dangerous.

38:15.339 --> 38:17.954
Now that I've found you,
I want to stay with you and help you.

38:19.344 --> 38:21.541
And so you shall, child.

38:22.046 --> 38:26.394
In your possession, the Boxes of Orden
can never be found by magical means.

38:26.477 --> 38:28.906
And since they should
always remain separated,

38:28.956 --> 38:31.793
you'll take two,
and we'll protect the third.

38:32.017 --> 38:33.316
Where will I keep them?

38:33.366 --> 38:35.867
We have friends in the resistance
who will take you in.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.938
Friends who we trust
with our own lives.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.765
And when all this is over,
we'll come see you again.

38:41.588 --> 38:44.647
And be together... as a family.

38:52.008 --> 38:53.811
I'll escort you to our friends,

38:53.861 --> 38:57.845
while Richard and Kahlan try to find out
where Rahl was going next.

38:58.274 --> 38:59.718
Because rest assured

39:00.168 --> 39:02.639
he won't be staying in the palace.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.837
May the spirits light your way
through the Land of Shadow

39:20.025 --> 39:22.365
to the Hearts of Eternal Peace.

39:45.871 --> 39:48.168
She brought us all together in the end.

39:55.804 --> 39:57.227
RAHL: Come closer.

39:58.424 --> 39:59.965
Closer.

40:06.210 --> 40:07.333
Tell me,

40:07.983 --> 40:09.854
what do you see?

40:27.469 --> 40:30.513
The pristinely ungifted one
is on their side now.

40:32.633 --> 40:34.619
Issue a proclamation.

40:35.895 --> 40:38.842
Let it be known throughout
the three territories

40:38.992 --> 40:43.481
that until the wizard,
the Seeker, the Mother Confessor

40:43.531 --> 40:47.282
and all three boxes of Orden
are brought to me,

40:48.172 --> 40:50.457
the people will feel my wrath.

40:50.953 --> 40:53.806
One village at a time.

41:01.091 --> 41:01.891
Zedd?

41:02.061 --> 41:02.971
Yes?

41:03.771 --> 41:04.581
What I did--

41:04.581 --> 41:05.875
That wasn't you.

41:06.454 --> 41:11.006
Man doesn't possess the power of Orden so much
as the power of Orden possesses the man.

41:12.150 --> 41:13.996
No, it was me.

41:14.732 --> 41:18.061
I felt that anger, that hatred...

41:20.869 --> 41:22.229
I still do.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.176
If not didn't,
you'd be a statue, not a man.

41:25.713 --> 41:28.496
We all have dark desires,
yearning for vengeance.

41:28.938 --> 41:31.762
And you must remember how those
feelings stirred your blood.

41:31.964 --> 41:36.190
'Cause what marks the line between good
from evil is the choice not to act on them.

41:36.269 --> 41:38.707
A choice you've always made
since I've known you,

41:39.293 --> 41:42.230
and I've known you since
the day you were born.

41:43.356 --> 41:44.487
Can I call you "gramps"?

41:44.487 --> 41:46.143
Not if you value your life.

41:46.235 --> 41:47.635
[chuckling]

41:48.513 --> 41:50.902
Do you remember once when I was little?

41:51.045 --> 41:54.254
I climbed the wall of your garden,
stole some apples from the big tree...

41:55.441 --> 41:57.825
...and you came outside,
and I thought for sure

41:57.875 --> 42:01.413
the crazy chicken man of Blackthorne Hill
would eat me for lunch.

42:03.285 --> 42:05.510
But you just stood there, staring.

42:08.694 --> 42:11.930
I was drinking in the sight
of my beautiful grandson.

42:13.666 --> 42:17.094
You ran off so fastquickly,
over the wall and down the hill

42:19.157 --> 42:21.292
So much time lost, Richard.

42:22.651 --> 42:24.740
So many left unsaid.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.688
I never even got to talk to my mother.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.427
Then let me tell you about her.
