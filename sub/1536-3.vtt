WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.365
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.520 --> 00:03.567
I have to see her.

00:03.640 --> 00:04.766
I don't have your baby.

00:04.840 --> 00:06.171
Viktor!

00:06.240 --> 00:09.449
We're losing him.
Time of death, 1:34 p.m.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.367
Can I ask you something about
the girl staying at Nick's house?

00:12.440 --> 00:13.566
Theresa Rubel?

00:13.640 --> 00:15.404
She's a suspect in
a double homicide

00:15.480 --> 00:17.209
and I'm having a bit
of a problem with this.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.441
I'm Special Agent Chavez.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.848
He's not the Grimm. I think
I know who the Grimm is.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.841
You Okay?

00:24.960 --> 00:26.360
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.771
What's going on?

00:28.440 --> 00:29.566
What the hell?

00:29.640 --> 00:31.165
I don't know where I am.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.924
"Stars, hide your fires; let not light
see my black and deep desires."

00:39.800 --> 00:41.006
I don't know where I was.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.601
What...

00:42.880 --> 00:44.041
Do you know
where you are now?

00:44.120 --> 00:47.602
Yeah, I had this
blinding headache.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.123
You said
you saw something?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.968
Some kind of old room.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.040
You're scaring me.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.810
Yeah, me too.
I'm okay.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.484
Uh, you were on
your knees, Nick.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.244
Yeah,
you couldn't see us.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.731
We're taking you
to the hospital.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.881
No, I don't need to go.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.489
Don't argue,
we're going.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.241
I'm not gonna
fall down.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.049
You kind of just did.
I got the door.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.131
Let me drive.

01:24.680 --> 01:25.886
I see.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.570
No, no, wait!

01:29.760 --> 01:30.761
Please.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.011
Let me go!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.240
Let go of me!

01:36.320 --> 01:37.924
Calm down,
nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.526
Look at me.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.200
Look at me.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.445
You're the Grimm.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.891
What do you want?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.448
You cut off
Weston Steward's head.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.044
I'm sure he was surprised
to see what you are.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.043
Detective Burkhardt
took you in.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.360
Why?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.850
Does he know
you're a Grimm?

02:16.680 --> 02:18.091
Listen carefully.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.366
There are people
who find what you are

02:23.440 --> 02:26.410
and what you can
do very important.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.405
They would be extremely
interested in your services.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.242
If you're thinking
it's the FBI, it's not.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.244
No idea what
you're talking about.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.727
What you're doing
now is not nearly

02:42.800 --> 02:45.280
as important as
what you can be doing.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.011
Being able to
identify and destroy

02:48.080 --> 02:50.686
dangerous Wesen
influence in society

02:50.760 --> 02:53.570
is a very valuable gift.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.369
It should not be wasted.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.120
There is a home for you.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.251
A select group, all working
together, all with the same goal.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.531
I'm sorry we had to do it like
this, but I had to make sure

03:10.600 --> 03:12.284
you were who I
thought you were.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.686
All we're asking is for
you to think about it.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.090
I'll be in touch.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.965
And, Theresa.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.325
Tell no one.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.925
For your sake

03:30.560 --> 03:31.766
and theirs.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.327
I'm not seeing
anything out of the ordinary,

03:36.960 --> 03:39.406
nothing that would explain
headaches or visions.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.124
No chest pains,
slurring of speech,

03:41.240 --> 03:42.810
pains radiating
down your left arm?

03:42.880 --> 03:43.881
No.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.041
Yeah, he was talking to me,

03:45.160 --> 03:46.400
he just couldn't see me.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.086
Well, I can't say this is something
I come across every day.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.169
I'd like you to see
an ophthalmologist

03:51.240 --> 03:53.208
to make sure there's
no optic nerve damage.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.605
Ladies and
gentlemen, good evening

03:59.680 --> 04:00.966
once again, and welcome

04:01.040 --> 04:04.362
to Kingston's Boxing here
in Portland, Oregon.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.241
Are you ready
for the main event?

04:18.519 --> 04:19.601
You're late.

04:20.079 --> 04:23.482
Bobby, don't hold back.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.124
How ya feelin', huh?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.600
Hey.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.724
Keep your eye
on the prize, kid.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.924
You're gonna be
world champion someday.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.565
Please don't.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.926
Let's get him out there.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.366
Let's go, kid.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.924
And now, it's fight
time at Kingston's.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.042
Wearing black and gold,
weighing in at 164 pounds,

05:44.280 --> 05:48.001
with an impressive 9-0 record,
Portland's own...

05:48.080 --> 05:50.162
Okay.
Clay Pittman!

05:52.440 --> 05:55.728
Introducing Tyler
"Hitman" Stephens!

06:00.600 --> 06:02.011
Come on, get out.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.367
Come on, come on,
let's go.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.206
Son of a bitch
broke my jaw.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.406
He broke my damn jaw!

06:17.640 --> 06:18.971
That's not enough!

06:19.360 --> 06:20.850
Get the hell outta here.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.324
This ain't over.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.965
Fight.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.165
Come on, Clay.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.491
That's it.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.770
Yeah, that's it!

06:59.160 --> 07:01.003
Get up! Get up!

07:01.320 --> 07:02.765
- I didn't think so! Get up!
- Get up!

07:02.840 --> 07:05.810
Another first round knockout
at 37 seconds in the first round...

07:05.880 --> 07:07.120
That's it, baby.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.964
Clay Pittman!

07:09.160 --> 07:10.889
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

07:30.720 --> 07:32.085
You coming to bed?

07:33.720 --> 07:34.881
What's that?

07:34.960 --> 07:36.644
This is what I saw.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.291
Except there were rats.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.480
Rats? Looks like some sort
of prison or a dungeon.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.164
Why would you see
something like that?

07:43.280 --> 07:44.520
I don't know.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.409
This started after
what Adalind did.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.209
Yeah.
It's gotta be connected.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.649
I just wish
things were back to...

07:51.720 --> 07:53.927
What? Normal?

07:54.920 --> 07:56.888
I don't even know
what that is anymore.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.085
Being a Grimm?

07:59.400 --> 08:01.448
Not being a Grimm? Not
being a Grimm and knowing.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.326
Look, I'm sorry.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.320
I'm just tired.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.568
Right, so then I guess now is
not a good time to ask you

08:10.640 --> 08:12.165
why Wu brought this over?

08:14.600 --> 08:17.331
He wanted to know why we have a
murder suspect staying with us.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.649
And why Hank and
I introduced her

08:19.720 --> 08:21.529
as a criminology
student at a crime scene.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.920
I think you're gonna have to
tell him the truth, Nick.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.331
I'm not a Grimm anymore.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.806
What am I
supposed to tell him?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.010
Hey.
Hey.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.559
You Okay?

08:37.520 --> 08:38.760
Yeah.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.051
No, all good.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.326
Night.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.966
Clay was born ready.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.362
Your boy ought to be
grateful for the opportunity.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.846
I expect that contract
this afternoon.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.570
You booked
another fight?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.970
Seattle kid
hurt his shoulder.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.964
I'm puttin' Clay
in his place.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.446
He was in the ring
all of 37 seconds, Abe.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.608
He's good to go.
It's too soon.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.569
Three more wins.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.803
Just three more and we're
fightin' in Las Vegas.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.644
Now get your ass out
there and tell him.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.480
Yeah. Who's this?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.170
Clay messed me up,
man.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.483
You gotta make this right or I'm
reporting you to the Commission

09:28.560 --> 09:30.449
and they'll pull your
license for what you do.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.370
Twenty-five grand
or you're done!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.287
Damage to the
optic nerve can cause

09:41.360 --> 09:44.170
blind spots,
pain, distorted vision...

09:44.400 --> 09:46.562
But your nerves
look healthy.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.326
Now lean back.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.522
However, there seems to be an
unprecedented level of

09:50.600 --> 09:51.931
activity in the macula.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.081
Which means...

09:53.160 --> 09:56.482
There are cells in the
retina known as cones.

09:56.560 --> 10:00.451
Most people have three types,
blue, green and red,

10:00.520 --> 10:04.923
and the overlap of these cones allows
people to see a spectrum of colors.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.561
A small percentage
of women have

10:07.640 --> 10:09.369
a fourth cone that allows
them to see colors

10:09.440 --> 10:11.249
invisible to
the rest of us.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.051
Are you suggesting that Nick
has a fourth cone?

10:14.120 --> 10:16.122
In the area where
the abnormality appears,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.202
there could be a fourth
or even a fifth cone.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.010
So, basically,
I'm a freak.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.320
I mean, Nick, do you see
things the rest of us can't?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.365
Not that I know of.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.807
Not a surprise.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.320
Since no one can
really see the world

10:30.400 --> 10:31.970
the way everyone else
sees it,

10:32.040 --> 10:35.203
people with special vision
tend to be unaware of it.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.448
Is this something that could
have just appeared recently?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.602
No, he'd have been
born with it.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.364
Then what's
causing the headaches?

10:41.920 --> 10:44.002
There's some
swelling in the area,

10:44.120 --> 10:47.249
which may be preventing light
from triggering the cones.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.450
Now whether that's temporary
or permanent, I don't know.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.200
And Juliette is
really struggling

10:56.240 --> 10:58.481
with the whole "finding a cure
for Nick" thing.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.801
You know, him going
back to being a Grimm.

11:00.880 --> 11:01.927
Can you blame her?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.001
No, not at all.
I mean, we get it.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.084
It's just...
She actually asked us...

11:06.160 --> 11:08.766
Didn't so much ask,
more suggested.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.401
Right. That not finding a cure might
be the only way for her and Nick

11:12.480 --> 11:14.209
to have
a normal life together.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.130
But there are
a lot of bad Wesen.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.965
Very few good Grimms.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.923
Adalind did this 110 Nick.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.884
How do we know there weren't
any long-term effects?

11:21.960 --> 11:24.281
Exactly. I mean, look
what she did to Juliette.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.600
And you.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.289
So, we're sort of thinking maybe
we should talk to your captain

11:30.360 --> 11:32.840
because he might know what
was in the potion that...

11:32.960 --> 11:34.121
Or at least
where he got it.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.281
Hmm.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.170
They just moved
him out of ICU.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.285
Hey, you got a minute?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.970
Actually... Look, I know
I'm inter-truding here

11:49.040 --> 11:50.769
but I think this
is really important.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.645
Hank, what are you
doing here?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.288
Well, it's not
my business anyway.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.929
Look, it's about the
wedding, and that girl.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.126
She's a Grimm.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.850
And, you know,
there's a lot of talk around.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.729
Everybody's kind of
on edge,

12:02.800 --> 12:04.325
not knowing,
is she good, is she bad...

12:04.400 --> 12:05.561
Are we in danger?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.688
Bud, she's a friend
of Nick's.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.125
You have nothing
to worry about.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.645
Oh, well that's a relief.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.047
You know, in a way maybe
it's sorta good news.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.929
You know, having two Grimms.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.846
What?

12:17.920 --> 12:19.251
Nick can't
see us anymore.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.560
Oh, my God,
he's blind?

12:20.640 --> 12:21.926
No. Bud.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.684
He can't see Wesen.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.326
Wesen.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.367
He's not a Grimm anymore.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.809
Oh, I gotta sit down.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.086
This is terrible, this
is worse than I thought.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.926
You know, probably best if you don't
tell anybody about this. Okay?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're
right, you're right.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.366
There's a lot of Wesen out there
who would like to know he's

12:42.440 --> 12:43.885
not what he used to be.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.530
I gotta get home
and not tell anybody.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.931
You got my money?

13:15.160 --> 13:16.491
Hey!

13:16.920 --> 13:18.081
How you feeling?

13:18.800 --> 13:20.086
Better.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.764
Man, you had me worried.
I mean, you were

13:21.840 --> 13:23.400
looking right at me
and couldn't see me.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.090
Gotta say,
I was a little freaked.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.480
What'd the doctor say?

13:26.560 --> 13:28.085
It's all good.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.564
What've we got, Wu?

13:30.640 --> 13:34.326
Uh, city worker found the body this
morning, dragged him out of the water.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.131
Body's pretty beat up. Looks like
it's been in the water all night.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.891
Vic's name is
Robert "Bang Bang" Moore.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.320
"Bang Bang" was
on his license?

13:41.400 --> 13:42.481
Didn't look
at his license.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.562
I arrested him on
a DUI 100 years ago.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.968
He's an ex-boxer. Did time
for aggravated assault.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.326
Some pretty big holes.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.481
Not from bullets.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.840
Probably dumped
farther up river.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.409
We got an address
for Bang Bang?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.685
Just ran it.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.444
Where's the city worker?

13:57.520 --> 13:58.885
He's right over there.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.605
Hey, Nick.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.526
Nick, we really
need to talk.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.726
Yeah. Later.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.721
Do you know where your
brother Bobby was last night?

14:15.760 --> 14:17.205
Ugh...

14:17.280 --> 14:18.930
He went out to
meet somebody.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.361
Do you know who?

14:20.440 --> 14:21.646
No.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.969
But he was mad. He got busted
up real bad the night before.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.167
Where?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.366
Kingston's Boxing.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.522
Had somethin'
going on at the fights.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.126
When I got home from work,
I saw his face.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.928
What was he
doing at the fights?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.048
He was pickin' up
work maybe?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.849
He didn't tell me.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.282
Thing is,
he couldn't stay away.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.604
No.
He gamble?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.643
Bobby just loved boxing.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.729
And he was damn good.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.408
Just got hit
too many times.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.084
If I hadn't
given her to Viktor,

14:55.160 --> 14:57.322
he would have
killed me and you.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.805
So you had no
choice but to give

14:58.880 --> 15:00.405
my granddaughter
to the Royals.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.764
I know you
better than that.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.490
You wouldn't have
given her to Viktor.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.282
But giving her
to the Resistance

15:08.360 --> 15:10.328
wouldn't have guaranteed
her safety, either.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.046
However it would
be advantageous

15:14.120 --> 15:16.805
if the Royals thought
the Resistance had her.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.971
Are you going to tell
me where she really is?

15:21.280 --> 15:22.486
I don't know.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.450
But she's with someone who
owes allegiance to no one.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.363
Oh! I'm sorry.
We can come back.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.171
No, please, come in,
we need to talk.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.444
Monroe, Rosalee, this is
my mother, Elizabeth.

15:37.640 --> 15:38.880
It's nice to meet you.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.321
Hi.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.606
You've spoken to Nick.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.281
Yeah.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.964
That's all right,
she's up to speed.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.485
In order for you
to help your friend,

15:47.560 --> 15:49.120
you need to know
what was in the potion.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.845
I could show them
where Adalind made it.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.524
You are not going anywhere.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.204
They need to know what she
used and how she did it.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.282
They won't be able to do
this without my help.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.044
You're not well enough.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.281
Nick helped bring your
granddaughter to safety.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.725
Now if it wasn't
for him, she'd be

16:02.800 --> 16:04.040
with the Royal
Family right now.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.401
And you think Nick can help
keep them from finding her?

16:06.480 --> 16:08.209
Yes, as a Grimm.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.285
I'll go with them.
No!

16:14.360 --> 16:17.523
We don't need to take you away
from your son at a time like this.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.761
Don't be afraid of me.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.207
Afraid? No, no, it's...

16:21.320 --> 16:25.484
To beat a Hexenbiest like Adalind,
you need a Hexenbiest like me.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.928
Open!

17:03.880 --> 17:05.483
Stan Kingston?

17:06.119 --> 17:08.327
Come on, Clay!
Put some energy in it!

17:09.280 --> 17:10.724
You gotta make weight.

17:10.839 --> 17:11.965
Time!

17:16.000 --> 17:17.240
Mr. Kingston?

17:17.800 --> 17:21.202
I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is
my partner Detective Griffin.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.602
Is there a problem?
You promote the fights here?

17:23.680 --> 17:25.125
That's right.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.406
Clay! Come over,
meet a couple of fans.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.440
This young bull is
gonna be the next

17:33.520 --> 17:35.887
middleweight
champion of the world.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.246
His trainer,
Abe Tucker.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.401
Hey, how's it going?

17:38.480 --> 17:39.561
Nice to meet you.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.688
Tickets, anything you need,
gentlemen,

17:41.760 --> 17:43.171
just drop your
cards at the door.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.725
We're investigating
a murder.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.929
Murder?
Bobby Moore.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.004
Bobby Moore?
You gotta be kidding.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.684
We understand he
worked a fight here.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.767
Hey, I don't know
what you were told,

17:54.840 --> 17:57.730
but Bobby was in no condition
to work anymore.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.369
I mean, he was
a great fighter in his day,

18:01.440 --> 18:02.851
but he stayed in
the game too long.

18:02.920 --> 18:03.921
But you saw him.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.844
Yeah, I threw him a few bucks
to keep the riff-raff out.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.331
That's about all
he could do.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.642
Don't you have
security for that?

18:11.600 --> 18:14.001
I help ex-boxers
whenever I can.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.686
Bobby's sister said he was
pretty beat up the other night.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.526
He did his job,
I paid him, he left.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.806
That's the last
I saw of him.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.881
Either of you
see him after that?

18:21.960 --> 18:22.961
No, sir.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.811
Probably got into it with some
drunk at a bar somewhere.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.530
Wouldn't have
been the first time.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.322
If you do think
of anything else...

18:40.000 --> 18:41.968
Bobby was one of the guys
in my dressing room.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.088
I hit him too hard,
didn't I? Didn't I?

18:44.160 --> 18:47.243
You didn't do nothing
he didn't get paid for.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.451
Do we believe Kingston?

18:56.760 --> 18:59.047
Did you just ask if I
believe a fight promoter?

18:59.440 --> 19:00.680
Clay looked nervous.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.649
Yeah, Bobby Moore
was an ex-fighter.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.846
Whoever gave him
that beating had

19:03.920 --> 19:05.285
to know how to
handle themselves.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.245
That's not normal.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.760
Not even close.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.130
Stan did two years for
fraud and tax evasion,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.771
was acquitted in
'07 of manslaughter.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.929
Settled six law suits
with ex-fighters out of court,

19:33.120 --> 19:36.124
but still got his
promoter's license.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.366
What have you got
on the kid?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.010
Still lives with his mom.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.522
Been in the fight game
for less than one year.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.603
It's cheating, right?
If he's Wesen?

19:45.680 --> 19:47.364
There are probably
Wesen in all sports.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.841
But in boxing, that kind of edge
can turn you into a killer.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.490
Maybe they're all Wesen.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.289
Stan, Abe, and Clay.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.604
May want to bring
Trubel in on this.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.491
No.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.003
She could tell us what kind
of Wesen we're dealing with.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.048
She almost got killed
the last time, Hank.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.406
I can't protect her anymore.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.760
She's a Grimm.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.444
And I'm not.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.404
What are we supposed to do,
bring her into

20:18.480 --> 20:20.403
every case that
we think involves a Wesen?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.482
That's not fair to her.
She's not a cop.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.971
Nick, she still has
a lot to learn.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.442
The more you teach her,
the better she's going to be.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.847
And until we find out
what's going on with you,

20:29.920 --> 20:32.082
we need her to be her best.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.561
I can smell it.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.768
Really? Because I'm
not picking up any...

20:44.840 --> 20:50.768
Adalind's life, her mother,
her fear, her loss...

20:51.200 --> 20:52.770
Oh, that smell.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.569
This is where she mixed it.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.170
Don't do that.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.160
There's a lot of
both of them in here.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.045
We need to find the spell.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.642
Look for a book
that won't open.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.441
I'm sorry?
A book that won't open?

21:24.840 --> 21:26.490
Won't that make it
kind of hard to read?

21:26.760 --> 21:28.000
Just find it.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.045
What's up?

21:35.360 --> 21:37.681
We got a boxer who might have
been involved in a murder.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.126
You think he's Wesen?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.601
Could also be the trainer, the
manager or one of the other boxers.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.364
We want you to spend
some time at the gym.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.249
Doing what?
Working out.

21:45.640 --> 21:50.168
Don't piss anybody off, don't follow
anybody, don't start any fights.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.090
I like boxing gyms.

21:52.160 --> 21:55.289
Used to sleep in one in Chicago.
I picked up a few moves, too.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.771
Well, don't use them.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.524
The boxer we're looking
at is Clay Pittman.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.081
All we want to
know is who's Wesen.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.081
Here's a new phone.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.330
I texted you
the address of the gym.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.561
Got it.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.207
You see something,
you call.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.205
She'll be fine.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.288
Whose alibi you
wanna check out first?

22:26.400 --> 22:27.925
Let's start with the kid.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.402
Clay just had
a knack for it.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.286
Such a quiet boy, I never
knew he had it in him.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.721
Well, he's done real well.
You must be very proud.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.290
Oh, lam.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.970
He works hard.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.564
Do you know where
Clay was last night?

22:42.680 --> 22:46.002
After the gym he
came home, ate,

22:46.080 --> 22:48.287
soaked in an Epsom
bath and went to bed.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.967
Sometimes, I wish he would
just go out with his friends.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.442
How long has Clay
been with Stan Kingston?

22:55.000 --> 22:58.209
Oh, Stan discovered
Clay about a year ago.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.847
He told me my son
had something special.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.441
He's a good manager.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.286
Oh, and his trainer Abe, too,
he's like a father to Clay.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.444
What about Clay's dad,
he around?

23:08.760 --> 23:10.285
No. He's...

23:10.960 --> 23:12.291
Took off a long time ago.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.442
No contact with him?
None.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.924
But we will be hearing from
him soon as Clay hits it big.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.010
That's the kind of man
he is.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.128
Look, I'm not ignorant
to the evil around my son.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.410
People wanting to take advantage
of him, take his money.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.607
It's hard to
know who to trust.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.526
But you trust Stan.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.205
I trust my son.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.681
Burkhardt.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.127
Found Bang Bang's car
about a mile up river

23:45.200 --> 23:46.440
from where
his body was found.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.204
His cell phone
was in the seat.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.685
I need to know if
he called anyone

23:49.760 --> 23:51.091
associated with
the boxing gym.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.720
Already checked.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.326
3:02 p.m. yesterday, he placed
a call to Stan Kingston.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.209
Lasted 23 seconds.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.530
Thanks, Wu.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.680
We need to get
back to the gym.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.925
Hey.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.240
Could you help me with this?
It keeps coming undone.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.447
Yeah.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.766
Thanks.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.651
What's your name?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.051
Trubel.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.045
I didn't ask what you are.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.085
It's just a nickname.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.205
It's a good
name for a fighter.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.446
What do they call you?

24:32.520 --> 24:33.760
Just Clay.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.211
Don't like nicknames.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.169
How do you
not like nicknames?

24:37.560 --> 24:40.245
They've got Bonecrusher,
Boom Boom, Sugar Ray.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.370
All boxers have
cool names.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.641
I don't.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.800
Yeah, well, who was your
favorite fighter growing up?

24:46.400 --> 24:47.640
Didn't have one.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.841
Get out of here.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.285
Yeah. Never watched.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.249
What, do you even
like boxing?

24:56.640 --> 24:58.130
You serious?

24:58.360 --> 24:59.771
You ask a lot of questions.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.808
I mean, why do you do it
if you don't like it?

25:04.960 --> 25:06.450
Money.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.846
For me and my mom.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.081
Well, there are
a lot easier ways to make

25:09.160 --> 25:11.162
money than getting
punched in the face.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.441
- Right?
- Hey!

25:12.840 --> 25:14.126
Hey!

25:15.400 --> 25:17.164
What are you
doin' talking to him?

25:17.280 --> 25:18.930
This ain't no social club.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.569
Go get ready for tonight.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.011
You.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.406
Get lost.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.289
No way. I paid my 15 bucks.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.010
Are you a fighter?
That's right.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.680
Lookin' to get a few bouts,
make a little money.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.441
Really?

25:42.280 --> 25:43.441
Hurricane!

25:51.600 --> 25:52.965
Let's see what you got.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.245
Oh, no.
I'm just getting back...

25:55.320 --> 25:58.051
You're either gettin'
in or you're gettin' out.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.650
Which is it?

26:02.640 --> 26:04.165
Guess I'm gettin' in.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.165
Abe!

26:07.480 --> 26:08.811
Glove her up.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.491
Keep your hands up.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.688
Didn't I tell her not
to get into any fights?

26:57.760 --> 26:59.125
I gotta stop this.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.850
Give her a chance,
you'll blow her cover.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.046
Come on, sweetheart.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.485
You fight dirty.

27:37.680 --> 27:38.841
Sorry, I...

27:38.920 --> 27:40.081
Yeah! I like dirty.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.683
You got a lot
of potential, kid.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.843
Abe is gonna start training
you full time tomorrow.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.563
Now, you go get a shower,
we'll talk after.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.286
Keep Clay in the dressing
room while I deal with this.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.281
Keep showing up, you're going
to have to pay gym fees.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.806
A few more questions.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.645
Oh, I need to get my
boy ready for a fight.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.286
So soon?

28:11.360 --> 28:13.362
Hey, I line 'em up,
he knocks 'em out.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.442
That's how you make
a name for yourself.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.160
What do you want?

28:17.240 --> 28:19.288
Bobby Moore called you
at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.286
Call lasted 23 seconds.
What'd you two talk about?

28:23.760 --> 28:25.888
Yeah, he was
lookin' for more work.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.962
Thought he could pick up a few
bucks at tonight's fight.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.042
And you just forgot to
mention that this morning.

28:30.120 --> 28:33.567
I got more on my plate than
worryin' about a drunk has-been.

28:33.640 --> 28:34.880
He say where he was?

28:34.960 --> 28:36.485
No, and I didn't ask.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.766
Where were you last night?

28:38.840 --> 28:41.161
Oh, come on, guys, I've
been through this before...

28:41.280 --> 28:42.406
Answer the question.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.201
Treated Abe and myself
to a fat juicy steak,

28:46.280 --> 28:48.442
and a bottle of
wine at ringside.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.887
The restaurant,
not the gym.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.205
Check if you like.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.406
Why are they back, Abe?

28:54.480 --> 28:55.561
They must know what I did.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.641
You didn't do nothin'.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.643
No, I hit that guy, and I hit
him, and I kept hitting him.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.085
Clay, you listen to me.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.566
You did not kill
Bobby Moore.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.085
You don't know!

29:04.680 --> 29:06.170
I can't do it anymore.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.330
No more fights, Abe.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.561
Please.

29:10.760 --> 29:11.841
You tell Stan for me.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.322
Tell Stan what?

29:16.200 --> 29:19.602
Cops are asking a lot of
questions about you, Clay.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.011
No worries.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.687
As long as we're a team, they
will never know what you did.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.525
Go get some rest.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.688
Lot of press is
gonna be there tonight.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.044
Gonna make
your momma proud.

29:43.400 --> 29:46.165
Abe, get some more guys.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.530
Better ones this time.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.330
Kid needs to be fired up.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.725
I'm not going to do it.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.845
Clay can't take it anymore.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.203
I make those decisions,
not you.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.528
This kid is going
all the way.

30:02.120 --> 30:06.284
Cancel the fight or I'll tell Clay the
truth about what happened to Bobby.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.044
You threatening me?

30:09.600 --> 30:11.489
After I brought you
this far?

30:11.720 --> 30:12.926
It's over.

30:14.400 --> 30:19.486
You're gonna shut your mouth
and do as you're told.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.360
Stan's Wesen!

30:32.480 --> 30:33.845
Abe, too.
But a different kind.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.804
You get a good look at them?
Oh, yeah.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.405
Just get me to the trailer.

30:45.880 --> 30:50.010
If I could show you how to get
out of here would you be happy?

30:52.720 --> 30:54.370
Do you know a way out?

30:54.440 --> 30:55.851
Oh, I do.

30:57.440 --> 31:01.331
Six stones in,
three stones high!

31:01.960 --> 31:04.964
Six stones in,
three stones high?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.086
What does that mean?

31:07.160 --> 31:11.449
Six stones in,
three stones high!

31:15.320 --> 31:21.646
Six stones in,
three stones high?

31:21.960 --> 31:24.930
Through the wall, you must try!

31:57.640 --> 31:58.971
Hello?

32:09.680 --> 32:11.489
My name is Hofmann.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.081
You want to find your baby?

32:14.960 --> 32:17.167
Uh, yes.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.611
Yes.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.369
You know a way out?

32:26.080 --> 32:27.650
I have got to find her.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.086
Please,
get me out of here.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.243
It's a treacherous journey.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.284
You will need
your strength.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.122
Here. Eat this.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.167
Oh, my God,
you have food.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.882
We must go. Hurry.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.085
Now!

33:03.520 --> 33:05.249
This one won't open.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.445
Let me give it a shot.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.606
I think we got it.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.808
Wish we had these
when I was in school.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.924
If you're finished?
What?

33:18.480 --> 33:19.686
Knife.

33:20.280 --> 33:24.683
I mean, that's a good idea, 'cause
that will open her right up.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.205
Please tell me that hurt.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.924
Here's the spell she used.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.164
Can you reverse it?

33:54.120 --> 33:56.248
Not here. It's contaminated.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.290
I need a place that's untainted
by another Hexenbiest.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.051
We could go
to the Spice Shop.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.451
What?

34:05.480 --> 34:07.050
What? I mean, yeah.

34:07.680 --> 34:08.966
Sure!

34:22.400 --> 34:23.889
NICK; What about this?

34:23.960 --> 34:27.885
He didn't have that horn on
his head, but just as ugly.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.925
That's it!

34:30.000 --> 34:31.842
That's him. That's Stan!

34:33.159 --> 34:34.241
You sure?

34:34.320 --> 34:35.400
100%.

34:35.480 --> 34:39.087
"Witness this type of creature
intimidating others around.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.003
"This beast
cannot be trusted."

34:41.320 --> 34:42.525
Okay, here we are!

34:42.639 --> 34:45.563
"Schinderdiv use their brutal
force to pin their victim,

34:45.639 --> 34:48.928
"and razor sharp
tusks to inflict damage."

34:49.000 --> 34:50.603
Same type of puncture wounds.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.011
What about this Wesen?

34:54.960 --> 34:58.521
"A Heftigauroch is
a bull-like Wesen

34:58.600 --> 35:00.921
"that morphs into
rage when provoked."

35:01.080 --> 35:04.562
Seriously? We're talking
raging Heftigauroch?

35:04.640 --> 35:05.766
It's your book, man.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.411
That's Abe, only he
looks a lot older than that.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.484
"Their hard heads and strong
hands make them great fighters.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.280
"However, despite
their inherent ability,

35:13.320 --> 35:14.760
"it is not in
their nature to fight."

35:14.840 --> 35:16.285
So they inherit
this great ability

35:16.360 --> 35:17.646
but they don't want
to use it?

35:17.760 --> 35:19.410
I bet Clay's
the same type of Wesen.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.440
He doesn't even like boxing.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.526
Burkhardt.

35:25.560 --> 35:26.925
What?

35:28.160 --> 35:30.080
They found a body a few
blocks away from the gym.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.690
It's Abe Tucker.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.130
What's the exact location?

35:34.640 --> 35:35.880
Trubel, come on.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.604
Wait here.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.600
Looks like an apparent suicide.
Jumped from the roof.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.484
That's quite a jump.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.803
Looks like he's got more
holes in him than rebar.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.769
Holes that look
kind of familiar.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.126
What is it?

36:11.240 --> 36:12.651
A note.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.490
"I killed Bobby Moore.
I'm sorry."

36:17.440 --> 36:18.885
He's short
and to the point.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.327
You think Stan was having
steak with Abe this time?

36:22.560 --> 36:23.846
Let's ask him.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.961
Hey!

36:35.120 --> 36:36.246
Don't hold back.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.560
Nobody's going inside.

36:37.640 --> 36:38.880
What are you...
I got a fight!

36:38.960 --> 36:41.281
Anyone who doesn't
belong here should go.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.610
This is harassment.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.051
You're not going
anywhere.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.925
You killed
Bobby and Abe.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.924
You must have some pretty good
evidence to make a charge like that.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.445
We do.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.325
You're Wesen.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.242
Got no idea what
you're talking about.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.130
Oh, yeah, you do.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.407
You're a Schinderdiv.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.484
You don't know anything.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.606
But I do.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.161
That's right,
dude, Grimm here.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.845
You.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.569
Where's Clay?
I don't know.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.961
He's got two minutes to get out
here or I'm calling the fight.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.246
Okay.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.371
You broke his neck.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.403
I didn't mean to kill him.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.690
You didn't,
I killed him.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.920
He attacked officers of the law.
You were not even here.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.690
I'm calling it in.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.129
Tell Clay he doesn't
have to fight.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.045
You Okay?

38:37.120 --> 38:38.531
No.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.125
If Trubel wasn't here...

38:41.880 --> 38:43.450
We can't keep
doing this, Hank.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.086
Where's Stan?

38:51.160 --> 38:52.491
I don't know.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.485
Abe's not here, either.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.770
I can't go out there, Mom.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.446
I don't want to fight.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.249
No. It's what you do, Son.

39:03.600 --> 39:07.082
Now, the fans,
and the reporters,

39:07.160 --> 39:08.605
they're all waiting for you.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.329
You don't understand,
it's killing me.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.165
Sweetheart.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.848
Look at me, look at me.

39:20.200 --> 39:24.091
You know I love you and I only
want what's best for you.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.491
I know, Mom.

39:27.440 --> 39:32.651
I got you the best manager
and the best trainer,

39:35.400 --> 39:37.687
and they did
what I told them to.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.088
And when they didn't,
I did.

39:40.240 --> 39:45.087
Now you get out there, and you
do what you were born to do!

39:47.680 --> 39:49.762
You get out
there and you fight!

39:50.480 --> 39:51.606
Get up!

39:52.440 --> 39:53.965
Get up!

39:54.160 --> 39:56.162
Get up right now, Clay! Fight!

39:56.240 --> 39:57.480
Fight!

39:57.600 --> 39:59.409
Get up and fight! Now!

39:59.640 --> 40:00.971
Hey! Hey! Stop it!

40:01.040 --> 40:02.451
Leave him alone!

40:03.240 --> 40:04.920
Clay, you don't have
to fight. Stan's dead.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.206
Dead?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.731
She's a Grimm.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.811
Kill her!

40:17.080 --> 40:18.650
Kill her before
she kills us!

40:20.520 --> 40:21.931
Kill her!

40:27.160 --> 40:28.366
No, Clay, don't!

40:30.000 --> 40:31.809
Put it down, Clay!

40:32.240 --> 40:33.969
Clay, put it down.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.245
No!

40:41.360 --> 40:42.361
No!

40:46.680 --> 40:47.966
I'm done.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.684
No, Clay...

40:51.280 --> 40:52.850
may...

40:56.640 --> 40:58.244
Oh, Clay, wait.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.725
Tonight's main
event is a forfeit.

41:03.800 --> 41:08.806
Winner by default is
Fist of Fury Frankie Solanos!

41:15.200 --> 41:17.248
"To a mirrored
image it will make.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.130
"Cover the pot with your hat.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.927
"And breathe in
the mixture from the vat."

41:29.320 --> 41:31.049
I wonder if Adalind
understood the risk

41:31.120 --> 41:32.770
to herself when
she made this spell.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.763
Risk to her?
What about Nick?

41:35.080 --> 41:38.482
To both of them. it ties them
together in unpredictable ways.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.681
How do we reverse it?

41:39.760 --> 41:43.082
First we have to make it. Hopefully
you'll have what we need.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.844
If we don't have it, I'll get it.
Nightshade.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.809
Got it. Petals or stems?

41:47.040 --> 41:48.405
Both.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.720
Gypsum extract.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.564
Uh, third shelf,
far right.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.566
Here we go.
