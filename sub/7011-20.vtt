WEBVTT

00:03.207 --> 00:06.339
So, everyone
enjoying dinner?

00:06.408 --> 00:08.928
Good.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.051
Now, um, I want to talk to everyone about
helping me with the church fund-raiser.

00:14.119 --> 00:15.974
Freeze.

00:19.111 --> 00:21.632
Okay, so...

00:21.703 --> 00:26.176
God's Magic Circle is our
church's women's auxiliary...

00:26.247 --> 00:29.346
and I volunteered to help
organize their next fund-raiser.

00:29.415 --> 00:32.381
And bravo, I say.
Bra... vo.

00:32.455 --> 00:35.619
Now, if you'll please excuse me,
I have to attend a meeting.

00:38.279 --> 00:42.208
It's, uh... It's
very important, so...

00:43.527 --> 00:44.705
Okay.

00:47.655 --> 00:52.706
Now, as you all know, um,
I'm stuck in a rut.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.612
And, um, I'd really...

00:56.680 --> 01:00.422
I-I just need to get out of the house
and-and experience new things.

01:00.487 --> 01:03.454
- But, Mom, I think you should...
- And I want your support...

01:03.527 --> 01:05.666
which, by the way,
I always give you...

01:05.736 --> 01:08.387
Mr. "I want to be a jazz guitarist."

01:14.151 --> 01:16.999
Eric, if your mother wants you...

01:17.063 --> 01:19.998
and Archie and Jughead here
to help her...

01:20.072 --> 01:22.177
then you're going to help her.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.801
- You're Jughead.
- You're Jughead.

01:24.872 --> 01:28.898
- You're so Jughead, it's not even debatable.
- You are so... Ow!

01:28.968 --> 01:32.263
Steven, stop hitting Jughead.

01:33.703 --> 01:36.191
- See?
- Hey.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.013
This is important to her...

01:39.080 --> 01:41.501
and we should
support her for this.

01:41.575 --> 01:43.680
So you guys'll help out.

01:43.751 --> 01:47.581
Well, thank you, Red.
And you're coming too.

01:47.655 --> 01:50.339
Oh, no, Kitty. I, uh...
I have a meeting.

01:51.816 --> 01:54.663
With you... at church.

01:56.071 --> 01:57.893
- Nice save, Dad.
- Shut up.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:32.679 --> 02:35.941
No, see, Fez, Bazooka Joe
wanted to see time fly...

02:36.007 --> 02:38.080
so Mort threw the clock
out the window.

02:38.151 --> 02:40.421
So time flew. Get it?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.865
Did the clock break?

02:44.936 --> 02:47.969
I don't know.
That's not really the point.

02:48.039 --> 02:50.592
It's still a pretty big
waste of a clock.

02:50.663 --> 02:53.380
Okay. Well, I gotta go.

02:55.944 --> 02:58.049
- See you later, sweetie.
- See you.

03:01.319 --> 03:03.458
You guys
are such a cute couple.

03:03.528 --> 03:06.245
- Yeah, I know. I really like Caroline.
- Me too. She's nice.

03:06.312 --> 03:08.733
For a psycho.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.749
Hyde, take that back.

03:14.983 --> 03:17.733
Psycho.

03:22.599 --> 03:25.185
You are a gifted mime.

03:26.824 --> 03:28.929
But that hurts.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.349
Hyde, Caroline's not a psycho.
You just don't get women.

03:32.424 --> 03:35.555
We have emotions. We're ruled
by the moon and the tides.

03:35.623 --> 03:38.819
And pretty clothes.

03:38.887 --> 03:41.571
Yeah, we should hang out with her,
you know, make her feel welcome.

03:41.639 --> 03:44.159
Yeah, you can never have
too many friends.

03:44.231 --> 03:47.079
Sometimes you feel like a nut;
sometimes you don't.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.477
Hey, you guys,
you know who <i>was</i> crazy?

03:49.543 --> 03:52.358
This camp counselor I once had who
used to make everyone do turbo sit-ups.

03:52.423 --> 03:55.652
But he'd put a towel over your face,
and then when you went to do the sit-up...

03:55.720 --> 03:59.942
He'd pull the towel away, and you'd
have to put your face in his butt.

04:00.007 --> 04:04.034
Donna, you stole the funny part.

04:05.159 --> 04:07.909
Well, Eric, I've heard it like eight times.

04:07.975 --> 04:10.114
Okay, I'm sorry.
Tell the story again.

04:12.135 --> 04:14.274
I'll laugh.

04:14.343 --> 04:16.644
But it'll be fake though, right?

04:16.711 --> 04:18.204
Oh, yeah.

04:20.072 --> 04:23.552
Okay, guys, I once had this camp counselor...

04:23.623 --> 04:27.452
Oh, my God, you guys.
The Petersons just got a new dog.

04:30.663 --> 04:32.518
Let's go!

04:40.071 --> 04:43.203
Okay, now, I have
work assignments for everyone.

04:43.272 --> 04:46.533
- Red, you're selling raffle tickets.
- I'm your man.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.989
And don't yell at the customers.

04:49.063 --> 04:51.649
I'm kinda your man.

04:51.719 --> 04:54.785
- And smile.
- You need another man.

04:56.456 --> 04:59.325
Okay, Michael, Steven,
you're in charge of bingo.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.788
And, Eric, I thought
you could run the cakewalk.

05:01.864 --> 05:03.871
Sure. What's cakewalk?

05:03.943 --> 05:06.758
It's cake and walking.

05:06.823 --> 05:08.928
What are you, on dope?

05:12.039 --> 05:14.276
So, uh, Pastor Dave,
what do you think?

05:14.344 --> 05:16.994
Gosh, Kitty, I'm impressed.

05:17.063 --> 05:21.798
I can't remember the last time a God's Magic
Circle fund-raiser looked so gosh darn wonderful.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.252
Hiya, gang.

05:24.327 --> 05:26.978
Hi, Pastor Dave.

05:27.047 --> 05:31.717
Say, God's Magic Circle... That sounds
like an Eric Clapton song, doesn't it, kids?

05:34.183 --> 05:36.572
Yes, Pastor Dave.

05:36.647 --> 05:39.102
Rock on, kids.

05:39.175 --> 05:41.346
Rock on, Pastor Dave.

05:50.503 --> 05:53.154
Come on, string bean.
Will you stop the record already?

05:53.223 --> 05:56.900
Hey, I'm in charge.
I'll stop it when I'm good and ready.

06:00.776 --> 06:03.590
And that's not because of you.
It's just 'cause I was ready.

06:03.656 --> 06:08.707
Okay, congratulations, Ed.
You win a chocolate cake.

06:08.775 --> 06:11.557
But I'm allergic to chocolate.

06:11.623 --> 06:14.012
Then why are you
in the cakewalk, Ed?

06:14.087 --> 06:18.211
I thought this was the line
for the bathroom.

06:21.991 --> 06:24.861
Now, don't you screw this up.
I want that marmalade cake.

06:24.935 --> 06:27.869
Sure, yeah, all right, pumpkin.
I was just talking to this guy over here...

06:27.943 --> 06:30.791
Oh, just forget it. You're gonna
screw it up. You always do.

06:30.855 --> 06:32.862
Just go stand over there.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.034
All right, my turtle dove.
Right over here.

06:36.103 --> 06:38.786
For the love of God,
let my wife win the cake.

06:38.855 --> 06:42.467
Well, it's in the hands
of the Lord now, sir.

06:42.535 --> 06:47.391
Okay, everyone, get ready
for another exciting round of cakewalk.

06:47.464 --> 06:50.693
Would you believe she
was once the sweetest...

06:50.759 --> 06:52.733
most beautiful girl in high school?

06:52.807 --> 06:55.142
Of course she was.

06:57.255 --> 06:59.622
A word of advice, kid.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.535
Never marry your
high school sweetheart.

07:02.599 --> 07:03.876
Why not?

07:03.943 --> 07:06.081
Oh, that's it, Glen.
Just keep slouching.

07:06.151 --> 07:09.796
- You're not mousy enough.
- That's why.

07:13.319 --> 07:16.167
<i>Hot as a pistol!</i>

07:16.231 --> 07:19.078
<i>Boy, did I take these jerks</i>
<i>to the cleaners!</i>

07:21.991 --> 07:24.063
Hey! That's a craps table.

07:24.135 --> 07:27.201
Yep. Except here it's called "cripes."

07:29.000 --> 07:31.683
Would you like to be
the next holy roller?

07:31.751 --> 07:36.486
Are you kidding? Next to prayer,
craps is my favorite thing about church.

07:36.551 --> 07:40.512
Well, enjoy yourself. I gotta
go check out the Last Supper bake sale.

07:40.583 --> 07:43.845
Free cupcakes for anyone
who doesn't deny the Lord!

07:46.087 --> 07:48.356
We gotta win
the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

07:48.423 --> 07:50.278
These are the most
technologically advanced...

07:50.343 --> 07:52.929
of all the plastic,
spring-loaded boxing robots.

07:55.207 --> 07:57.662
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky.

07:57.735 --> 08:00.288
Or... we could cheat.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.334
Kelso, man, you're willing to cheat?

08:03.399 --> 08:06.149
Here in the house of the Lord?

08:06.215 --> 08:08.833
You're coming along nicely.

08:08.903 --> 08:10.758
Yeah, I mean, it's not that bad.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.725
Because technically
we're only in the basement of the Lord.

08:13.799 --> 08:17.247
And I'll bet
he never comes down here.

08:17.319 --> 08:19.326
Yeah, good point.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.406
Plus what old lady wants
Rock'em Sock'em Robots...

08:21.479 --> 08:23.519
or a box of Pop Rocks
or a SuperBall?

08:23.591 --> 08:26.209
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
they could hurt themselves.

08:26.279 --> 08:30.981
You give the elderly Pop Rocks,
and they could get all foamy and stroke out.

08:33.895 --> 08:36.316
- So we're helping.
- We're helping.

08:48.359 --> 08:50.214
B-7.

08:51.495 --> 08:53.470
Bingo!

08:53.543 --> 08:55.998
Gosh, that's lucky.

09:00.167 --> 09:03.516
- That's Donna.
- Oh, look at that. A carrot top, huh?

09:03.591 --> 09:07.485
<i>Ah, that's great, kid.</i>
<i>Just great.</i>

09:07.559 --> 09:09.828
You know,
I was a lot like you...

09:09.895 --> 09:11.870
a milky-white loser
with a cheap haircut...

09:11.943 --> 09:14.976
and less muscle tone
than a canned ham.

09:19.207 --> 09:22.141
Okay, first of all, Glen...

09:22.215 --> 09:24.866
I'm wiry, okay?

09:24.935 --> 09:28.350
Yeah, I was dating
the hottest looking girl in the school.

09:28.423 --> 09:30.627
Thought I had it made.

09:30.695 --> 09:34.437
- So what happened?
- I don't know really.

09:34.503 --> 09:37.405
One day we just realized
that she had heard all of my stories...

09:37.479 --> 09:39.487
and I had heard all of her stories...

09:39.559 --> 09:43.837
and, well, that's when she stopped
being nice and started eating.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.851
Oh, God, Donna eats.

09:55.111 --> 09:58.406
Better watch it there, kid.
It starts small.

09:58.471 --> 10:03.970
A few wise-ass comments, and then they're
puttin' you down in front of your friends.

10:06.855 --> 10:10.532
Donna, you stole the funny part.

10:11.751 --> 10:14.620
Well, Eric, I've heard it like eight times.

10:14.695 --> 10:17.662
Then before you know it,
you're praying for death.

10:17.735 --> 10:19.874
Either hers or yours.

10:19.943 --> 10:23.390
Either way, at least it's quiet.

10:23.463 --> 10:26.627
You really
brought me down, man.

10:26.695 --> 10:29.379
Yeah.
Yeah, I do that.

10:31.623 --> 10:33.794
You guys are so much fun
to hang out with.

10:33.863 --> 10:36.165
We really are.

10:36.231 --> 10:39.264
So what does Cosmo say
about me? I'm a Gemini.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.596
Um, okay, the twins.

10:42.663 --> 10:47.038
Two people trapped in one body.
So you're like a split personality.

10:47.111 --> 10:50.407
If you ever say that again,
I'll kill you.

10:52.135 --> 10:53.990
I'm kidding.

10:54.055 --> 10:57.284
You guys, I'm psycho,
remember? Whoo-hoo!

10:58.695 --> 11:01.378
Wow, that was...
that was really good.

11:02.599 --> 11:05.894
I almost wet myself.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.999
All right. All right.
Enough small talk.

11:08.071 --> 11:11.966
- So, is Fez, like, an amazing kisser?
- Jackie, don't make me blush.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.300
No, she's only asking because when she
kissed him, he did this thing with his tongue.

11:15.367 --> 11:19.490
- You kissed Fez?
- Oh, my God. It was so nothing. He had this stupid crush on me.

11:19.559 --> 11:22.177
Shut up!

11:25.575 --> 11:28.062
If either of you
ever touch my boyfriend...

11:28.135 --> 11:30.437
I will hunt you down like animals.

11:30.503 --> 11:32.358
Understand?

11:39.591 --> 11:41.980
You're kidding, right?

11:42.055 --> 11:44.389
You're kidding, right!

11:44.455 --> 11:48.001
I'll scratch your big,
dumb eyes out! Got it?

11:53.095 --> 11:56.030
Oh, my God.

11:54.903 --> 11:57.652
I know.
Her nails are beautiful.

12:08.311 --> 12:12.305
I just wanted to thank you once again
for doing such a wonderful job, Kitty.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.229
Well, I'll tell you, Pastor Dave...

12:14.295 --> 12:17.011
it feels so good to get out of the house
and do something important.

12:17.079 --> 12:20.624
You know who else got out of the house
and did something important? Jesus.

12:23.447 --> 12:26.261
And lucky for us he did.

12:30.935 --> 12:32.790
Are you all right?

12:32.855 --> 12:36.816
Well, I ran out of underwear,
and I'm wearing my swimsuit, and, uh...

12:36.887 --> 12:38.927
I've said too much.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.597
Eric?

13:04.023 --> 13:06.357
I'm the richest man in church!

13:06.423 --> 13:09.140
Fellas, these dice like me.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.031
Whoa! Oh, yeah!

13:14.103 --> 13:17.267
B-I-N-G-O!

13:17.335 --> 13:21.743
And that spells losers. Losers.

13:22.775 --> 13:24.335
Damn it!

13:24.407 --> 13:27.124
<i>Never marry your high school sweetheart.</i>

13:51.127 --> 13:53.876
- Oh, hey, did I tell you...
- Heard it!

13:59.126 --> 14:01.428
Who ate the last doughnut?

14:07.863 --> 14:09.718
I did.

14:12.599 --> 14:14.454
Son of a bitch.

14:17.239 --> 14:19.061
You ate the first 11!

14:19.127 --> 14:20.949
Oh, shut up!

14:23.863 --> 14:27.638
No, I won't.
I weigh 80 pounds.

14:29.015 --> 14:32.877
Look at you!
Do you know why I'm bald?

14:32.951 --> 14:35.252
My body is eating its own hair!

14:44.502 --> 14:47.186
- Hey!
- Hey!

14:47.255 --> 14:50.157
Hey, Diamond Jim, come here.

14:50.231 --> 14:52.140
How's the abandoned raffle going?

14:52.214 --> 14:54.319
Kitty, I'm on fire.

14:54.390 --> 14:57.205
I just rolled four
hard eights in a row!

14:57.270 --> 15:01.525
God is bending the laws
of probability just for me.

15:03.286 --> 15:07.247
Hey. We won everything.

15:08.278 --> 15:10.798
Yeah, we're just
supernaturally lucky.

15:10.870 --> 15:13.488
Hey, Mom, I got
some bad, bad news for you.

15:13.558 --> 15:17.836
For every one doughnut I get,
Donna gets 11.

15:17.910 --> 15:20.660
Storm's a-brewin'.

15:20.726 --> 15:24.752
Eric, how could you leave the cakewalk?
Just look at those people.

15:26.870 --> 15:30.961
- Kitty, how's everything going?
- Just great. Everything's great.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.925
You kids buy a raffle ticket?
Third prize is a rock and roll record.

15:34.999 --> 15:39.603
<i>John Denver's Greatest Hits.</i>
He fills up your senses.

15:42.774 --> 15:46.419
I ask for one day of help,
and this is what I get?

15:46.486 --> 15:49.650
Um, yeah.

15:49.718 --> 15:51.573
Oh, wonderful.

15:51.638 --> 15:53.940
I started out in-in God's Magic Circle...

15:54.006 --> 15:57.355
and ended up in Satan's Evil Square.

15:57.431 --> 16:02.286
I can't believe any of you can walk
into a church without bursting into flames.

16:02.358 --> 16:06.035
- Kitty, we're...
- Okay, you know what? Just forget it. Just go.

16:06.102 --> 16:08.404
And please leave your ill-gotten gains.

16:20.694 --> 16:23.661
I won them. They're mine.

16:27.926 --> 16:30.130
- Hi, Mom. We're sorry.
- Very sorry.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.784
- Welcome home.
- I love you so much.

16:32.855 --> 16:35.189
Okay, you know what?
Just stop.

16:35.254 --> 16:37.109
- I'm not mad at you.
- You're not?

16:37.174 --> 16:40.305
No. On my way home,
while dreaming...

16:40.374 --> 16:45.263
about being married to someone else
and having <i>his</i> children...

16:45.335 --> 16:48.979
I, um... I realized
that this is all my fault.

16:49.046 --> 16:51.053
All right!

16:51.126 --> 16:53.395
Hold on.
This may be a trap.

16:54.774 --> 16:57.873
No. I shouldn't have forced
you to come with me...

16:57.942 --> 17:02.415
when what I really wanted was just...
just to do something for myself.

17:02.486 --> 17:05.387
Look, Kitty, I'm sorry.

17:05.462 --> 17:08.528
And if there's anything
that you wanna do from now on...

17:08.598 --> 17:11.467
you should go and do it
if it makes you happy.

17:11.541 --> 17:15.765
And we'll support you
by... not going with you.

17:17.462 --> 17:19.317
Would that be good?

17:19.382 --> 17:22.132
Yes. Thank you, Red.

17:22.198 --> 17:25.810
Good. You're welcome.

17:31.798 --> 17:34.351
Wow. You and Mom.

17:34.422 --> 17:37.771
You were... You were fighting,
and then you just made up.

17:37.846 --> 17:41.042
And you guys have been married
for like a million years.

17:42.870 --> 17:44.878
It fills my heart with hope.

17:46.870 --> 17:49.554
That's it.
You're going in the army.

17:53.366 --> 17:55.308
She was scary.

17:55.382 --> 17:58.065
Really scary.

17:58.134 --> 18:01.396
Okay, <i>Exorcist</i> scary.

18:01.462 --> 18:03.731
Fez, you have to break up with her.

18:03.798 --> 18:05.653
Okay, you two are overreacting.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.588
She is a little loony,
but she wouldn't hurt you.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.410
Hey.

18:11.478 --> 18:14.129
Hello, my sweet girlfriend.

18:18.838 --> 18:22.318
We've been over this!

18:22.390 --> 18:24.398
Caroline!

18:24.470 --> 18:26.641
Touch Fez and die!

18:26.710 --> 18:29.710
- Stop it! These are my friends!
- Oh, really?

18:29.782 --> 18:32.815
Did they shoplift 30 dollars' worth
of indelible ink markers...

18:32.886 --> 18:35.057
and write your name
on every inch of their room?

18:35.126 --> 18:37.493
Every inch! Did they?

18:41.334 --> 18:45.076
Um, did you guys do that?

18:46.390 --> 18:48.529
- No.
- No.

18:48.598 --> 18:51.249
Well, there you have it.

18:53.014 --> 18:57.749
Um, Caroline,
I have to break up with you.

18:57.814 --> 19:02.124
Why? And don't say it's because
I'm crazy. Because I'm not crazy.

19:02.198 --> 19:05.711
Oh, no. Oh... Oh, no.

19:05.782 --> 19:10.604
Of cour... Of course not.
It's just, um... It's just, um...

19:12.470 --> 19:15.252
- Donna and I are in love.
- What?

19:15.318 --> 19:18.133
- Oh, my God.
- Ewww!

19:18.198 --> 19:21.394
Yes, we are freaky for each other.

19:22.646 --> 19:25.101
Please tell her. Please.

19:26.614 --> 19:29.298
What if she tries to kill me?

19:29.366 --> 19:31.635
You're a giant.
You can take her.

19:50.422 --> 19:53.869
Oh, my God. You're really
breaking up with me?

19:57.430 --> 20:00.212
Is that okay?

20:00.278 --> 20:03.791
Fez, I just want to say...

20:03.862 --> 20:08.302
that you will never be as happy
as you were with me!

20:08.374 --> 20:12.302
Ever. And until you realize that,
I'll be seeing you.

20:12.374 --> 20:15.789
And by "I'll be seeing you,"
I mean that I'll be watching you.

20:15.862 --> 20:19.790
But you won't know it. Except
I just told you, so you do know it.

20:21.782 --> 20:26.517
Anyway, this isn't over!

20:33.494 --> 20:36.909
Whew. Sure am glad that's over.

20:46.934 --> 20:51.855
One, two, three, go!

20:53.174 --> 20:55.029
Damn it.

20:57.622 --> 20:59.477
Damn it.

20:59.542 --> 21:01.844
All right, mine's broken. Did...

21:06.006 --> 21:08.079
Robots are stupid.
