00:05.105 --> 00:06.868
SeÃ±or Humberto.

00:06.939 --> 00:09.738
Now, you know you ain't got no
business trippin' with that, man.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.208
I got you, brah!

00:16.282 --> 00:17.715
Jesus!

00:22.288 --> 00:23.152
All right, Jesus.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.155
What you got for me today?

00:24.224 --> 00:25.122
I've been good!

00:25.191 --> 00:26.089
It's all good to me, Brother.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.319
You know the world
is yours, man...

00:27.394 --> 00:28.418
Whatever you want, man.

00:28.495 --> 00:30.520
I need the numbers to the lotto.

00:30.597 --> 00:31.859
The lotto numbers?

00:31.931 --> 00:33.364
Is that the best
you can ask, man?

00:33.433 --> 00:35.697
I mean, there's folks out here
dying of famine and pestilence,

00:35.769 --> 00:36.599
and you want the lotto numbers?

00:36.669 --> 00:37.601
Come on, man.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.602
You can do better than that.

00:38.671 --> 00:39.603
What can you give me, then?

00:39.672 --> 00:40.832
I got some kindness,

00:40.907 --> 00:44.035
I got compassion, and I
got love for all mankind.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.702
You better get up on
some of that, man.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.076
Don't anybody want
no shit like that!

00:47.147 --> 00:48.409
Aw, man.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.142
Well fuck y'all's

00:50.216 --> 00:51.183
I don't stink.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.684
If I stank,
I would smell myself.

00:52.752 --> 00:53.719
Yes, you do stink.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.152
You smell like ass and crackers.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.689
You got the nerve, walking
around with all that Brown on,

00:57.757 --> 00:59.019

00:59.092 --> 01:00.616
Nigga wan Kenobi.

01:00.693 --> 01:01.921

01:01.995 --> 01:03.189
Oh, yeah?

01:03.263 --> 01:05.424
You look like you got a headful

01:05.498 --> 01:06.795

01:06.866 --> 01:08.060
Yeah, you, partner.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.726
You can't insult me

01:12.105 --> 01:13.436
Fuck you, too, homeboy.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.133
I still love your bitch ass.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.732

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000

Hey, yo, G!

van across the street, man.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.313
Nigga, right now.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.043
You think I'm calling you now
for you to move it later?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.517
Hurry up.

01:59.586 --> 02:00.610
All right, Sir.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.745
My boys will be here

02:01.821 --> 02:03.152

02:09.729 --> 02:11.162
Come on. Push it,

02:11.231 --> 02:12.357
Getting it moved for you.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.195

02:17.337 --> 02:19.202
We're getting it

02:21.541 --> 02:22.473
Come on, man.

You trippin'.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.141

02:29.215 --> 02:30.739
Man, you know the fucked up
part about it,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.751
besides this being the
motherfucking son of God?!

02:32.819 --> 02:34.912
You out here writing these
funky-ass $79 tickets

02:34.988 --> 02:35.852

02:35.922 --> 02:37.116
and look at this, man!

02:37.190 --> 02:38.623
Fucking street ain't even clean!

02:38.691 --> 02:40.716
The least your fat ass can
do is clean up some stuff!

02:40.793 --> 02:42.317
Uncle Phil-lookin'

02:42.395 --> 02:43.384
Uncle Phil?

02:43.463 --> 02:44.794
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-air,"
nigga!

02:44.864 --> 02:45.990
Hey, stall him out, Fish.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.123
Stall him out, man,

02:47.200 --> 02:48.792

02:48.868 --> 02:50.028
Look at this dude, man.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.368
Come on, brah. Relax.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.202
You feel me?

02:56.442 --> 02:57.739
Eugene!

02:57.810 --> 02:58.902
I ain't even mad at you, dawg.

02:58.978 --> 02:59.910
It's just a job.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.606
Matter of fact,
I congratulate you, man,

03:01.681 --> 03:06.118
'cause six days sober after
34 long years of rotgut,

03:06.186 --> 03:08.086
hard-core drinking
like you been doing...

03:08.154 --> 03:10.019
that's quite an
accomplishment, man.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.556
You know, that's
some superb shit.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.454
You feel me?

03:16.262 --> 03:17.422
Hey, Eugene!

03:17.497 --> 03:19.226
Go get your colon checked, pimp!

03:20.233 --> 03:21.700
Hey, man, check it out.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.328
I stole this out
of my mama's ashtray.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.338
Now, that's all there is,
so let's make it last.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.464
Here. Light up.

03:29.676 --> 03:30.836
Mmm.

03:31.844 --> 03:32.833
Mmm!

03:32.912 --> 03:34.436
That's good stuff.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.216
You gonna pass the joint?

03:39.285 --> 03:40.252
I just got it, buddy.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.015
I'll pass it to you in a second.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.348
Mmm!

03:45.425 --> 03:46.357
Man, pass the
motherfuckin' weed, man!

03:46.426 --> 03:47.586
Damn!

03:47.660 --> 03:48.820

03:48.895 --> 03:51.728

03:51.798 --> 03:54.699
nigga, you smoke
all the fucking weed.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.201
Yeah, and I don't think you
really factor in that somebody

03:57.270 --> 03:59.067
got to actually
pay for this weed.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.662
And who is that?

04:00.740 --> 04:02.731
Me, Boonie, Fish.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.333
Nigga, even Tray
be frontin' you.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.877
Well, what happened to us
getting up off our ass

04:05.945 --> 04:07.310
and growing our own bud, though?

04:07.380 --> 04:08.438
The Community Garden.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.845
Instead, we're on
some gangsta shit

04:09.916 --> 04:11.144
all the motherfucking time.

04:11.217 --> 04:13.208
We could be getting right out
the mud ourselves, man.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.685
Weed and vegetables...

04:14.754 --> 04:18.656
Rutabagas, tomatoes,
Spanish onions, artichokes.

04:18.725 --> 04:19.952
Nigga, this is
Southwest Compton.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.459
I ain't trying to be
no goddamn farmer.

04:21.527 --> 04:22.619
I know where we at.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.026
Man, we can't front
you no more, Dawg.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.564
You really finna get
at me like that over

04:25.632 --> 04:27.259
a little funky-ass
weed, though?

04:27.333 --> 04:28.766
I mean, you do realize I died

04:28.835 --> 04:30.268
for your motherfucking sins,
right?

04:30.336 --> 04:32.031
Oh, that shit getting old.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.402
Homey, that's my life!

04:33.473 --> 04:35.407
That was 2,014 years ago.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.464
Yeah. That's old.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.339
Hey, but sayin',
check this out...

04:38.411 --> 04:40.311
we got this little lick we
gonna hit across town, right?

04:40.380 --> 04:42.871
Me, Jason, Boonie...
we got a plan.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.042
There you go with
the schemes and plots.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.085
Nigga, you not even listening!

04:46.152 --> 04:47.414
Hey, man, it's solid, man.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.478
We're going to East L.A.
To pick up a brick, and...

04:49.555 --> 04:50.715
check it out...
my mom's paying.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.052
Your mom's paying for it?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.717
That income-tax check,
you know what I'm saying?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.055
So you know that's gonna
be at least a pound.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.186
Mm-hmm.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.162
She said all we need is
a crew like three deep.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.994
Now, I don't know
these niggas, man,

05:00.066 --> 05:03.001
but they're highly
recommended on Instagram.

05:03.069 --> 05:06.266
Now, all you got to do
is drive Boonie mama car,

05:06.339 --> 05:08.034
and you're gonna get a cut.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.836
But if it's Boon mom car,
why I got to drive?

05:09.909 --> 05:11.240
I mean, why you
don't drive, Dawg?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.710
Hey, my mom said I can't go.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.007
She don't want me on this run.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.207
Plus my pit bull getting
ready to have puppies.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.943
I wasn't there when
my kids was born,

05:18.017 --> 05:19.575
but I'm gonna be
there for my bitch.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.779
So, all you need me to
do is drive the car and

05:21.854 --> 05:24.322
watch over y'all with God's
good grace and that's it?

05:24.390 --> 05:25.823
That's it.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.519
I mean, hit us with one of
those miracles, in ca...

05:27.593 --> 05:29.993
in case we need it, which we
won't, 'cause they legit.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.462
They straight up.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.055
Fish, man, you know I ain't
in charge of miracles, man.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.064
That's Pops, man.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.065
Just do what you do.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.034
Aw, shoot.

05:41.574 --> 05:42.700
Ooh!

05:44.944 --> 05:45.933
Hey, baby.

05:46.012 --> 05:46.842
How you doin'?

05:46.913 --> 05:47.777
Oh, you're looking good.

05:47.847 --> 05:48.905
Really, Jason?

05:48.981 --> 05:50.107
Him again?!

05:50.183 --> 05:51.810
I thought we talked
about getting high

05:51.884 --> 05:53.545
and hanging out
with homeless dudes.

05:53.619 --> 05:54.608
Come on, baby.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.745
Don't do this in
front of the homies.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.084
Hi, Diane!

05:57.156 --> 05:58.987
Girl, your hair is bangin'!

05:59.058 --> 06:00.457
She got the
po-po perm.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.427
Is this what you call
getting your life together,

06:05.498 --> 06:07.261
partying all the fucking time,

06:07.333 --> 06:09.767
coming home for a little
something, drunk,

06:09.836 --> 06:11.565
smelling like barbecue sauce?

06:11.637 --> 06:14.868
She hit him with the
smelling like barbecue sauce!

06:14.941 --> 06:16.602
I don't want you hanging
out with these bums.

06:16.676 --> 06:17.973
Y punto.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.807
Sue! Lisa!

06:20.880 --> 06:23.110
Is this wonderful basket
of shit for me?

06:23.182 --> 06:24.444
Wow, ladies!

06:24.517 --> 06:26.678
Somebody got love for
their Lord and Savior!

06:26.753 --> 06:27.685
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

06:27.754 --> 06:29.016
Come here, girl.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.919
You know I love y'all
like a motherfucker, come here.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.651
Seriously...
what is it with that guy?

06:32.725 --> 06:33.692
You want a beer?

06:33.760 --> 06:34.818
Oh, I love y'all so much.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.122
Baby, that's Jesus.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.654
Yeah, man.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.528
She sitting up there, talkin'
'bout she think we need a break.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.932
I think she finally
tired of my ass, man.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.264
Don't even let it happen, Dawg,

06:44.337 --> 06:45.929
'cause God wants y'all
to be together.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.701
And on top of that,
she fine as mnh!

06:48.775 --> 06:50.675
That's about as good as
you're gonna do, Dawg.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.335
God told you that?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.936
He told you he want
us to be together?

06:54.013 --> 06:55.844
Nigga, she an atheist cop.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.847
Why would God care?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.315
Heaven if I know,

06:58.384 --> 07:00.284
but what I'm sure of is the
fact that she good people, man,

07:00.353 --> 07:01.877
and she care about you, brah.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.046
And to be honest with you, J...

07:03.122 --> 07:04.214
I am your Lord and Savior.
I can be honest.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.348
Yeah.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.585
You need a boot up
them cheeks one time,

07:06.659 --> 07:07.751
'cause you be fuckin' up, J.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.192
You ain't living
up to your potential.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.162
Plus, y'all got the little
black-latin love going on, man.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.063
L.A. Really needs to see
that shit right now, dawg.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.226
You got Maggie on line 1.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.599
What's happenin', Mag?

07:17.670 --> 07:19.069
Talk good to me, baby!

07:25.411 --> 07:26.742
Now, why you always got
to act like that, man,

07:26.813 --> 07:28.075
when I ask you to do something?

07:28.147 --> 07:29.944
But when you're down in the
dumps, who do you call?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.813
Ain't nobody trippin' off
what you got on, girl.

07:31.884 --> 07:32.851
It's the homies.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.250
We chillin'.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.379
All right, fo' sure.
Yeah. Hey, Tray?

07:37.723 --> 07:39.315
Mag comin' through,

07:39.392 --> 07:41.383
like two more six-packs
of that hard apple cider,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.258
three boxes of blunts,

07:43.329 --> 07:45.320
a 20-pound bag of ice,
and you want something, Dawg?

07:45.398 --> 07:46.330
Yeah, some vienna sausages.

07:46.399 --> 07:47.923
- Red or blue can?
- Blue can.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.900
Okay. So, nobody has
any money for this, or...

07:49.969 --> 07:51.095
you know what?

07:51.170 --> 07:52.603
I wanted to talk to
you about that, man.

07:52.672 --> 07:53.604
I'm glad you brought that up,
'cause, Tray, you know

07:53.673 --> 07:54.799
I love you, right?
- Right.

07:54.874 --> 07:55.806
You know I'll never
forsake you, right?

07:55.875 --> 07:56.933
Right.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.271
Man, I got your best
interests at heart,

07:58.344 --> 07:59.971
so I'm gonna need you
to trust me on this, man.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.843
You gots to... you gots to
complete this mission, man.

08:01.914 --> 08:02.881
Pay attention.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.348
You gots to complete
this mission.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.510
Okay. I'm just not sure how
it works without any money.

08:06.586 --> 08:07.985
Shh, shh, shh.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.521
All you need is the holy spirit.

08:09.589 --> 08:10.521
That's it.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.114
Okay.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.089
Yo, Fish!

08:13.159 --> 08:14.251
What we rollin'?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.487
What's happenin', pimps?

08:17.363 --> 08:18.762
Maggs!

08:18.831 --> 08:20.389
It's about time you got your
delinquent ass out here to

08:20.466 --> 08:21.398
function with the homies.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.832
What's happenin' with you?

08:22.902 --> 08:25.666
Man, tell this grimy fool to
let me come up on that pickup.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.262
Hey, look, I'm only driving.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.534
I ain't got nothing
to do with that.

08:28.608 --> 08:29.973
Exactly.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.100
Y'all ain't got
nothin' to drink, man!

08:31.177 --> 08:32.269
What y'all sippin' on, man?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.676
Oh, that's some bullshit.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.008
Aw, man.
What's up with this?

08:35.081 --> 08:37.447
Don't you know we
like fine grapes?

08:39.051 --> 08:40.712
Hey, that's what's
up right there, man!

08:40.785 --> 08:43.619
Hey, hook me up there with some
of that brown so I can lay these

08:43.688 --> 08:44.951
ugly bitches down.

08:45.024 --> 08:45.854
You dig?

08:45.925 --> 08:47.222
Heavens, no!

08:47.293 --> 08:49.227
Is this the only way I can get
y'all attention, man...

08:49.295 --> 08:50.660
Come through with
a little yid-nac,

08:50.730 --> 08:51.890
a little meat,

08:51.964 --> 08:53.158
some big-booty women?

08:53.232 --> 08:54.563
It helps.
Nigga, pour up.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.726
Naw, naw, man.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.325
What happened to love
and kindness, brah?

08:57.403 --> 08:58.597
Man, why you got
to be like that?

08:58.671 --> 09:00.571
You know what?
I'm cool on y'all.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.574
I come through spreadin' the
Gospel all the time, man,

09:02.642 --> 09:04.337
but y'all ain't trying
to hear your boy, though.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.240
No, y'all ain't
tryin' to hear me.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.778
So, you know what?

09:06.846 --> 09:08.541
I don't even think I want to
let y'all hit this fine yac,

09:08.614 --> 09:10.582
'cause your minds ain't ready
and your hearts not open.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.548
Hey.

09:12.752 --> 09:13.582
Hey, Vic!
What's happenin', man?

09:13.653 --> 09:14.642
You want some of this yac?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.119
Told you niggas
no barbecuing, didn't I?

09:16.188 --> 09:17.815
I said it was unsanitary, right?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.120
Didn't I say no barbecuing?

09:20.192 --> 09:22.217
How many times I got to keep
telling y'all the same thing

09:22.295 --> 09:24.126
over and over till you get it
through your blasphemous-ass

09:24.196 --> 09:25.254
minds, huh?

09:25.331 --> 09:26.457
Okay. Settle down.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.965
I mean, ironically,
the way you're speaking

09:28.034 --> 09:29.296
to Jesus is quite blasphemous
if we're gonna

09:29.368 --> 09:30.733
be technical.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.464
Ironically, I didn't slap
the shit out of you soon as

09:32.538 --> 09:33.664
I got down here.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.831
Who made you the Pope, huh?

09:34.907 --> 09:35.839
Chill out, Vic, man.

09:35.908 --> 09:36.875
It's cool, man.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.308
We made enough
for everybody, brah.

09:38.377 --> 09:39.207
You want a plate?

09:39.278 --> 09:40.745
- Plate?
- Yeah.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.007
I don't want no goddamn plate.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.571
I want y'all to
obey the rules, man!

09:43.649 --> 09:45.116
There's no barbecuing!

09:45.184 --> 09:46.651
What the fuck is
your problem, Vic?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.243
My problem is you need
to find another place

09:48.321 --> 09:49.788
to be a bum, homey!

09:49.855 --> 09:50.844
This is my complex!

09:50.923 --> 09:51.753
I run this!

09:51.824 --> 09:52.813
It's my job!

09:52.892 --> 09:54.052
No barbecuing!

09:54.126 --> 09:55.093
Matter of fact, you know what?

09:55.161 --> 09:55.991
I've been saying
the same thing over

09:56.062 --> 09:57.256
and over to y'all niggas.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.388
Y'all niggas don't
know how to listen.

09:58.464 --> 10:00.022
How many times I got to
say the same thing over

10:00.099 --> 10:01.623
and over and over and over?

10:01.701 --> 10:02.633
Check this out.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.431
Hey, man!
What you doing, brah?!

10:04.503 --> 10:06.403
That's the end of
that shit, ain't it?

10:06.472 --> 10:08.030
That's some fucked up shit, Vic.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.938
Know why it's fucked up?

10:10.009 --> 10:12.341
Because the ants...

10:12.411 --> 10:13.742
got to eat.

10:13.813 --> 10:14.837
What the fuck is that about?

10:14.914 --> 10:16.211
Yeah.
They like ribs, too.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.408
Vic, the homies ain't
even ate yet, man!

10:17.483 --> 10:18.541
What are you doing?!

10:18.618 --> 10:19.778
Well, the homies
ain't gonna eat.

10:19.852 --> 10:20.784
Homies don't work.

10:20.853 --> 10:21.820
See them ants?

10:21.887 --> 10:23.320
They work hard all day long.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.720
Those is black ants.

10:24.790 --> 10:28.282
They like chicken, watermelon,
shrimp, and ribs.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.090
Now, you know that's a
racist-ass joke, Vic.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.220
Wash your feet.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.491
What?

10:32.565 --> 10:34.192
You look like one of
them niggas from Australia.

10:34.266 --> 10:35.699
I swear to God,
if I wasn't on parole...

10:35.768 --> 10:37.565
Well, bless you, too, Vic!

10:39.538 --> 10:40.903
If God didn't love you,

10:40.973 --> 10:43.203
he'd have made you a girl
looking exactly like you do.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.209
You know, I'm all right
for a dude, though.

10:45.277 --> 10:46.608
Ooh, my!

10:47.780 --> 10:49.714
Looky here, looky here!

10:49.782 --> 10:50.749
Jesus!

10:51.917 --> 10:53.817
Oh, my sweet Lord.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.080
Mm-mm-mmm.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.587
How you doin'?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.556
Too blessed to be
stressed, baby.

10:59.925 --> 11:00.857
Hey, mama.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.359
Hey.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.793
Come on in.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.731
Ooh, Ms. Tudi,

11:08.801 --> 11:10.792
I'm feeling what you
done with this spot!

11:10.870 --> 11:12.269
You like it?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.568
Yes, and these
chandeliers is wet!

11:14.640 --> 11:16.403
Chechnyan Crystal, baby.

11:16.475 --> 11:17.942
And, Jesus, none of those...

11:18.010 --> 11:20.808
Ooh, hallelujah...
would have been possible with...

11:20.880 --> 11:22.245
Oh, my bad, Ms. Tudi.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.214
Mm-hmm.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.944
I made these for you -

11:26.018 --> 11:29.181
Chocolate mint pistachio
with a dash of sea salt.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.722
- That's my favorite.
- All right!

11:30.790 --> 11:32.223
Those are for Jesus, fat ass.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.282
Jesus, can I get you some tea?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.554
Oh, yes.
Please, Ms. Tudi?

11:35.628 --> 11:36.993
All right.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.428
Hey, man, give me a cookie, man.

11:38.497 --> 11:39.429
Naw, man.

11:39.498 --> 11:43.059
I prayed for the cookie, man.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.898
I said no cookie, Boonie!

11:44.970 --> 11:46.301
Sit your fat ass down!

11:46.372 --> 11:48.897
Sit down.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.238
Jesus, you're still gonna
be able to do that thing

11:51.310 --> 11:52.436
for me later, right?

11:52.511 --> 11:54.103
- That pickup?
- Mm-hmm.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.842
Oh, Ms. Tudi, a real "G"
like you in these streets

11:56.916 --> 11:58.884
don't need no problem
gettin' no weed, though.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.816
Well, but, Jesus,
my clientele...

12:00.886 --> 12:01.944
Yoga bitches you...

12:02.021 --> 12:04.285
My clientele, nigga...

12:04.356 --> 12:06.085
Come to me for the best weed.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.126
And I hear these guys
got the best weed.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.286
Then why Boonie can't go?

12:09.361 --> 12:10.885
'Cause he bad luck...
that's why!

12:10.963 --> 12:12.328
Fine.
I don't want to go.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.593
Oh, I know you didn't,
'cause you're lazy.

12:14.667 --> 12:19.127
You're a fat, bad-luck-having,
lazy nigga like your father.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.867
Ms. Tudi, you know, you really
be going too hard on that boy.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.374
Oh, you think I'm hard on him?

12:23.442 --> 12:27.708
This is a Romanian
ultrasuede llama-skin sofa.

12:27.780 --> 12:28.872
That's nice!

12:28.948 --> 12:30.848
Yeah, with an ass-sized
crater in it.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.245
Is that what that is?

12:34.320 --> 12:35.252
Mm-hmm.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.652
I thought it was
part of the design.

12:36.722 --> 12:37.950
No, that's his ass crack.

12:38.023 --> 12:38.853
Damn, Boonie!

12:38.924 --> 12:40.186
Now, listen, Jesus...

12:41.727 --> 12:43.752
You d... tsk!

12:43.829 --> 12:44.818
Mnh.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.091
Now, Jesus, you're the only one

12:46.165 --> 12:48.998
I trust with my
money and my car.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.173
What's that?

12:56.242 --> 12:57.675
Fish, is that a firearm?!

12:57.743 --> 13:00.541
Technically, this is a homemade
marble-shooting pistol,

13:00.613 --> 13:04.310
not a firearm, so, legally, I
can't catch a gun case for this.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.214
But it'll light somebody ass up.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.378
Man, I thought you said
these dudes was cool, man.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.978
You know I don't like guns, man.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.750
Oh, yeah, they cool,
but now we cool, too!

13:11.824 --> 13:14.520
I already told you they come
highly recommended online.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.185
They got 1,500 followers.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.025
What's up with that mask, Maggs?

13:18.097 --> 13:19.496
What, you guys
didn't bring masks?

13:19.565 --> 13:20.497
Hell, no.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.726
We're gonna do some janky shit.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.291
When you're doing janky shit,
you wear a mask!

13:23.369 --> 13:26.770
Surprise, mother.
Get your bitch ass out the car!

13:26.839 --> 13:28.136
Now... come on!

13:28.207 --> 13:29.265
Get your ass out the car!

13:29.341 --> 13:31.206
Get your ass up
against the wall!

13:31.277 --> 13:32.710
Hurry up! Go!

13:32.778 --> 13:34.211
Get your ass up
against the wall!

13:34.280 --> 13:35.907
You look like you're praying,
too, spring break bitch.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.414
Get your hands up
against the wall!

13:37.483 --> 13:39.508
Hey, hey, do you gentlemen
consent to a quick search?

13:39.585 --> 13:40.415
Yes, sir!

13:40.486 --> 13:41.350
And the bitch, too.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.409
Where the money at?

13:42.488 --> 13:43.477
Give me that jacket.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.386
Give me that jacket.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.753
Take it off!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.622
Oh, looks like 2 "G's."

13:47.693 --> 13:48.887
Thanks for paying in advance.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.657
Pleasure doing business
with you bitches.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.264
Damn!
We got set up, man!

13:55.334 --> 13:56.426
They're cool, huh, Fish?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.901
They're cool, huh?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.961
Highly recommended online, J?

14:00.039 --> 14:03.031
Fish, man, what the...
what are you doing?!

14:04.543 --> 14:06.170
What the hell?!
Are you kidding me?!

14:06.245 --> 14:08.008
Bitch, move your car!
Move your car!

14:08.080 --> 14:09.172
Move your car, bitch,
or I swear to God I'll shoot

14:09.248 --> 14:10.579
this whole mother...
move!

14:10.649 --> 14:12.310
Pretty please,
move your car, bitch!

14:12.384 --> 14:14.113
Oh, hell. My bad.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.118
Shut the fuck up
and turn around!

14:15.187 --> 14:16.916
Turn around!
Drop the gun.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.422
- Drop it!
- My bad, dawg.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.514
Turn around and
shut the fuck up!

14:19.592 --> 14:20.524
We cool.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.254
Take the mask off, all y'all!

14:24.230 --> 14:25.128
Hey, it's white boys!

14:25.197 --> 14:26.027
White boys? 1

14:26.098 --> 14:27.122
With some fake-ass guns.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.793
Michael, Chandler, Ross...

14:29.869 --> 14:32.463
I am so disappointed in all you!

14:32.538 --> 14:34.438
Do you know how mad your mother
would be if she found out you

14:34.506 --> 14:35.768
was out here doing gangsta shit

14:35.841 --> 14:37.103
instead of at
water-polo lessons?!

14:37.176 --> 14:38.268
Huh?!

14:38.344 --> 14:39.834
Are y'all familiar
with the wrath of God?!

14:39.912 --> 14:40.776
Where the money at?!

14:40.846 --> 14:41.813
Where the weed at?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.109
Cough up the money.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.615
- Where the weed?
- The weed's in the trunk!

14:44.683 --> 14:46.048
Hey, we got Boonie mama money.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.415
Right there. Right there.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.078
- I got it.
- You want to be a thug?!

14:49.154 --> 14:51.145
How 'bout a fuckin' marble
to your temple, boy?!

14:51.223 --> 14:52.053
Huh?!

14:52.124 --> 14:52.988
M-marble?!

14:53.058 --> 14:54.958
Shut the fuck up!

14:55.027 --> 15:00.294
Ross, Chandler, Michael...
man, I swear to Pops I want

15:00.366 --> 15:01.765
to put my holy
hand down on y'all.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.892
But you know what?

15:02.968 --> 15:05.835
I'm not,
'cause I'll forgive you.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.202
Look at you, man.
Calm down.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.366
Look at him. He's just
cute, like a little smurf, huh?

15:09.441 --> 15:10.840
Come on.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.070
Let's bust a move, Fish.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.244
Come on, Fish!

15:17.616 --> 15:19.243
Come on, Fish!

15:21.720 --> 15:23.119
Jesus, your robe!

15:23.188 --> 15:24.382
Shoot!

15:30.796 --> 15:32.263
Yeah. We got about an
elbow of that good white-boy

15:32.331 --> 15:34.231
weed and all of
Boonie's mama money.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.858
We won!

15:37.069 --> 15:38.161
Where the fuck is the money?

15:38.237 --> 15:39.363
I went on and let the
white boys have it.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.462
You did what?

15:40.539 --> 15:41.597
Nigga, you magically
went in my pockets

15:41.674 --> 15:43.232
and gave the white boys
the fucking money?

15:43.309 --> 15:45.436
That's a goddamn miracle
in reverse, man!

15:47.680 --> 15:49.841
- Show me those hands!
- There you go.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.576
- Out of the car... now!
- No, it's cool.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.174
We don't need your help,
officer... we're good here.

15:53.252 --> 15:54.617
We're straight, man.
Come on, man.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.484
Jesus Christ,
get out of the fucking car!

15:56.555 --> 15:58.079
Brah, I like it here.
It's cool, Bro.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.283
I like it in here.

15:59.358 --> 16:00.416
Stop resisting arrest.

16:00.492 --> 16:01.618
I'm not resisting!

16:01.694 --> 16:03.127
I'm not resisting!

16:03.195 --> 16:04.093
Goddamn it!

16:04.163 --> 16:04.993
I surrender!

16:05.064 --> 16:07.328
I surrender! Aaah! Ohh!

16:10.536 --> 16:11.867
Hi, Dianne!

16:11.937 --> 16:12.995
He was with you, wasn't he?

16:13.072 --> 16:14.539
- Who?
- Jason.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.335
J?
Oh, heavens, no.

16:16.408 --> 16:17.340
You know J wouldn't be along...

16:17.409 --> 16:18.569
Bullshit.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.168
The arresting officer said
two men escaped on foot.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.735
Now, I know one of them was J,

16:21.814 --> 16:23.076
so cut the crap, hmm?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.706
J wasn't even with us, Dianne.

16:24.783 --> 16:25.977
I'm serious.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.040
I can prove it.

16:27.119 --> 16:30.179
Yeah? How?

16:30.255 --> 16:32.519
Right before your friends came
and busted up our little party,

16:32.591 --> 16:34.616
I had called him and told
him to bring some stuff.

16:34.693 --> 16:35.819
- Called him?
- Yeah.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.259
- You're full of it.
- I'm serious!

16:37.329 --> 16:38.921
Go on... check the voicemail
with your detective ass.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.795
- I know you got the code.
- Watch it.

16:40.866 --> 16:41.855
If I'm lying, go on...
leave him.

16:41.934 --> 16:45.233
But if I'm right
and God's right,

16:45.304 --> 16:46.828
you'll praise him and thank him.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.333
You have no new messages.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.741
You have one new message.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.574
Hey, what up, J?
This your boy, man.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.910
We out here doing some
unspeakably janky stuff

16:56.982 --> 16:58.415
that you don't want no parts of.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.508
Check it out, though...

16:59.585 --> 17:00.517
I need you to run
to the store for me

17:00.586 --> 17:01.678
and get me some stuff, man...

17:01.754 --> 17:03.483
Some Froot Loops,
a bag of high skins,

17:03.555 --> 17:04.749
and a big old soda.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.915
Good lookin' out,
pi-i-i-i-mp.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.084
You know what?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.184
Just get out of here.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.193
Word!

17:10.262 --> 17:11.126
But what about...

17:11.195 --> 17:12.527
You got got, you idiot...

17:12.598 --> 17:14.930
Lawn clippings
and cilantro, hmm?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.594
The whole brick?

17:17.669 --> 17:19.637
White boys been ganking fools
for weeks with the stuff.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.172
You're free to go.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.505
And stop brainwashing my man.
I don't like it.

17:24.576 --> 17:25.906
I'm watching you, eh?

17:25.978 --> 17:28.105
Diane, you're such a
pretty girl and a hard worker.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.148
You need to take a little
time for yourself, you know?

17:30.215 --> 17:31.705
Go get your feet done...
a little pedicure.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.910
You know what I'm talking about?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.976
Get you some highlights
put there.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.544
I mean, your hair is beautiful.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.648
I heard they had put Jesus in
the cell with the drag Queens.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.590
Oh, look, man.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.958
Damn. Look at his
robe hanging.

17:46.498 --> 17:49.695
Jesus, look, we're sorry, man.

17:49.768 --> 17:51.167
Yeah, we're sorry, man.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.534
Look, I don't understand how
you pulled that off with Diane.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.129
Matter of fact,
I do understand how you did it,

17:55.207 --> 17:56.674
and I just want to
say thank you, Bro.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.107
Man, you know we wouldn't
just bail on you like that.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.439
You're Jesus.

17:59.511 --> 18:00.842
We figured you'd find a way
to get up out of there.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.971
Find a way out of it?

18:02.047 --> 18:03.605
Man, watch out, man.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.242
Did I just found a way to get up
out of it when they had your boy

18:06.318 --> 18:07.512
crossed up in Judaea?

18:07.586 --> 18:08.712
Man, promise me...

18:08.787 --> 18:10.345
y'all bought some
ungrateful fools, man.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.855
Me and Pops, we come
through all the time,

18:11.924 --> 18:12.891
but y'all suckers,
not so much, man.

18:12.958 --> 18:13.856
See what I'm talking about?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.086
He don't even want to listen.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.320
Every time I'm trying to
tell him something good,

18:16.395 --> 18:17.726
he don't want to hear
what I'm talki...

18:17.796 --> 18:19.991
so, I guess you ain't ready
to start this garden.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.054
Community Garden.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.122
Community Garden!

18:22.201 --> 18:23.133
You bullshittin'...
all of us?

18:23.202 --> 18:24.226
All of us.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.463
It's about time
y'all came on in!

18:25.537 --> 18:26.868
That's what I'm talkin' about.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.032
Come on in. Bring it on in.
You know what time it is, girl.

18:29.108 --> 18:29.938
You're gonna knock me down.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.635
Yeah, what about my mom money?

18:31.710 --> 18:33.177
See, I wanted to talk to
you about that, Boon,

18:33.245 --> 18:35.076
'cause although we ain't
got your mom's money,

18:35.147 --> 18:36.239
what we do have
is the love of God

18:36.315 --> 18:37.339
and our integrity, brah,

18:37.416 --> 18:38.815
and it don't get
no better than that!

18:38.884 --> 18:40.215
Act right, 'cause the
sooner we get to work,

18:40.285 --> 18:41.684
the sooner we're gonna be...

18:47.159 --> 18:47.989
That's right!
