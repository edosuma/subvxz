01:16.920 --> 01:18.400
- Mum.
<i>Hi, darling.</i>

01:18.400 --> 01:20.400
Do you know where Dad is tonight?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.640
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:04.440 --> 02:06.760
<i>Jay, darling?</i>

02:08.080 --> 02:09.240
<i>What's wrong?</i>

02:15.280 --> 02:16.240
<i>Jay?</i>

03:14.960 --> 03:15.920
Jay.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.560
Jay.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.560
Jay!

03:34.960 --> 03:36.480
Oh no. Jay!

04:17.040 --> 04:18.720
I'm going to get someone.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.680
- And that's your son's fiancée?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.840
- Please, Mum.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.040
No. Come on, stop. Stop.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.880
Stop!

05:30.400 --> 05:32.880
- Please, Mum. Stop! Stop!

05:33.640 --> 05:35.120
Stop! Oh my God!

05:38.720 --> 05:39.560
Dad.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.560
Is it true?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.560
What have you done to us?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.480
- What the fuck have you done?
Sally, stop.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.840
Stop.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.520
Leave us.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.840
Ingrid.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
He called me.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.440
He called me, just before.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.320
He must have known
what he was about to find.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.760
I am so sorry.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.560
No, you're fucking not.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.800
What did you think it was?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.280
Some kind of love?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.520
It's our son!

07:08.480 --> 07:10.720
Look what you took from him.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.200
And from me!

07:13.800 --> 07:16.440
You have taken him from me!

07:20.000 --> 07:22.720
- Ingrid! No, no, no, no! Stop!

07:22.720 --> 07:24.440
Please, stop. Stop.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.520
You have taken my son!

08:07.480 --> 08:09.680
When you knew you were lost to her...

08:13.400 --> 08:15.200
you should have killed yourself.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.640
I could have buried you and lived.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.880
Your son spent his life
trying to... to emulate you, when...

08:53.440 --> 08:59.120
when his greatest quality was
being absolutely nothing like you at all.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.240
But you will sit with us today.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.640
Thank you, everyone. A few words.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.600
<i>Death is nothing at all</i>

10:10.720 --> 10:12.160
<i>It does not count</i>

10:12.800 --> 10:15.280
<i>I have only slipped away
Into the next room</i>

10:15.960 --> 10:17.320
<i>Nothing has happened</i>

10:18.560 --> 10:21.240
<i>Everything remains exactly as it was</i>

10:22.000 --> 10:24.960
<i>I am I, and you are you</i>

10:24.960 --> 10:30.880
<i>And the old life that we lived
So fondly together is untouched, unchanged</i>

10:31.960 --> 10:35.840
<i>Whatever we were to each other
That we are still</i>

10:51.960 --> 10:53.480
I'm so very sorry.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
I've been where you are right now.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.280
When Aston took his life.

11:07.080 --> 11:07.920
No.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.040
It was an accident.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.480
My son didn't kill himself.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.480
Oh.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.600
Well, that's something, I suppose.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.480
To know that your child wanted to die,

11:24.240 --> 11:25.560
that's what's hardest.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.760
I've never gotten over it.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.720
You were with him, weren't you?

11:33.480 --> 11:34.480
You saw him?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.120
Where's Anna?

11:51.520 --> 11:52.440
I don't know.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.040
Surely

11:58.640 --> 12:00.320
she left a note or

12:01.000 --> 12:01.880
something?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.920
Course she didn't.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.320
This is what she does, I'm afraid.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.400
What?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.040
Run away.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.480
You're waiting for her, aren't you?

12:45.760 --> 12:48.960
I can see how completely irrelevant
I've become to you.

12:55.160 --> 12:58.000
And I shall take
considerable strength from that.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.240
This is the last time
we'll ever see each other.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.120
I understand.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.720
Just go, will you!

14:16.640 --> 14:17.480
Anna.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.560
Just let me know that you're okay.
That's all I'm asking.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.200
I need you.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.240
Where have you gone?

14:40.840 --> 14:41.880
Anna!

14:45.640 --> 14:47.600
I've got an appointment with Peggy Graham.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.920
She's on five.
- Thanks.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.880
I need to call--
I'll find it.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.320
Peggy. Where is she?
- You can't just walk in.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.720
- Where's Anna?
- What are you doing here? Have you lost--

14:58.720 --> 14:59.800
Just tell me!

15:03.080 --> 15:03.920
Please.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.600
Are you sure
you should be going in to work so soon?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.680
They'd understand
if you wanted a bit more time.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.600
More time won't change a thing.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.120
I need to go in.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.360
Anna.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.040
Are you okay?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.160
Yeah.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.360
You know you can stay here
as long as you like.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.240
I like having you around.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.000
Thank you.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.080
Just promise me that was the last time.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.160
What do you mean?

16:36.360 --> 16:39.720
You could have had
such a beautiful life with Jay.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.440
What do you mean by "the last time?"

16:52.520 --> 16:54.920
These poor boys that

16:55.880 --> 16:58.400
fall for you so intensely.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.560
He didn't stand a chance, did he?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.480
Neither did your brother.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.480
Aston loved you so much.

17:18.880 --> 17:19.960
You knew?

17:22.240 --> 17:23.760
Of course I did.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.440
You were inseparable.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.120
You knew, and... and you didn't do a thing.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.040
What could I do?

17:37.680 --> 17:40.240
You seemed happy to me.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.240
And he was enthralled by you.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.040
I was a child.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.480
I don't think anyone
would have known how to handle it.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.960
You...

17:56.960 --> 17:58.480
you should have stopped him.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.680
All those nights he came to my room,
you... you should have stopped him!

18:05.200 --> 18:08.160
Well, I... I wish
we could have stopped him, but...

18:08.960 --> 18:13.800
but he was so scared
and... and... and confused--

18:13.800 --> 18:15.480
So was I!

18:16.160 --> 18:17.880
No!

18:22.680 --> 18:23.880
Where are you going?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.840
- Oh no. Don't leave me.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.960
- I need you.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.000
Don't go.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.160
I'm Anna.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.640
David.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
Nice to meet you.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.040
So, uh...

20:30.280 --> 20:31.800
are you having a good holiday?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.640
There you are.
- Oh. Hi, darling.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.640
Um...

20:40.640 --> 20:45.040
- This is Anna. We met at the pool.
- Lynnette.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.880
What's your room like?

20:50.440 --> 20:52.120
We're overlooking the car park.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.080
I'm considering complaining.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.320
It's lovely.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.640
It's the honeymoon suite.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.080
Where is the lucky bugger, then?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.280
He's not here.

21:04.880 --> 21:05.960
Ooh!

21:05.960 --> 21:07.920
Leaving you alone on your honeymoon?

21:07.920 --> 21:09.600
What's wrong with him?

21:11.120 --> 21:12.080
He's dead.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.920
What happened?

21:23.600 --> 21:27.040
I had an affair with his father.
My fiancé discovered us and he fell.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.360
He fell because of me.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.400
Ow.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.320
Wait.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.480
Just...

23:52.040 --> 23:53.040
Slow down.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.480
Stop. Stop! Stop!

23:56.200 --> 23:57.600
What?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.960
Sorry.
- Where the fuck are you going?

24:00.960 --> 24:03.720
Just back off!
Hey, I'm talking to you.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.760
You don't make it easy, do you?

25:02.520 --> 25:03.520
I had to come.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.760
I know.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.080
"Make up your mind and do it."

26:36.000 --> 26:38.440
That's what my father
always used to say to me.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.160
"You wanna be a surgeon?"

26:42.840 --> 26:43.680
"Good."

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
"Stick with it."

26:48.880 --> 26:50.480
"You wanna marry Ingrid?"

26:52.000 --> 26:52.840
"Great."

26:54.760 --> 26:56.160
"She's a fine choice."

27:05.000 --> 27:06.200
And then you met me.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.760
Yeah.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.520
I let uncertainty in.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.560
And look what happened.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.000
I don't think...

27:40.080 --> 27:43.160
we can ever separate
who we are from what we've done.

27:50.120 --> 27:50.960
But

27:52.120 --> 27:54.400
we can't let it all be for nothing either.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.800
- Jay died because of us.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.080
Still, I wouldn't change it.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.920
You don't regret it?

28:17.440 --> 28:18.480
How can I?

28:24.040 --> 28:26.320
We caused so much pain.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.520
But it's done now.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.480
I am so sorry

28:34.400 --> 28:35.560
for what happened.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.400
But I wish we'd never met.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.520
Don't try and find me again.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.320
Congratulations on the wedding.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.680
Uh, are you back in London?

29:47.160 --> 29:48.000
Okay.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.440
Um...

29:51.080 --> 29:51.920
I need you.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.320
Can you meet me at the flat?

29:57.840 --> 29:58.680
Thank you.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.280
William, right?

31:36.920 --> 31:37.760
Yeah.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.200
That staircase is gorgeous, isn't it?

31:46.480 --> 31:49.840
It really is a rare opportunity
to buy one of these flats.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.280
This one has only just come on the market.
It's a one-bed, one-bath,

31:53.280 --> 31:57.320
but with such a big living area,
it feels bigger, doesn't it?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.480
I can't do this anymore.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.080
I can't go back to Mum's.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.000
You don't have to.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.040
You've got to stop punishing yourself.

32:28.040 --> 32:28.880
Come on.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.640
I'll take you to the bedroom.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.160
<i>I am writing this</i>

33:14.160 --> 33:16.720
<i>as you make your way
through the night towards me.</i>

33:17.520 --> 33:19.160
<i>I will wait patiently,</i>

33:20.680 --> 33:22.840
<i>thinking of the years to come.</i>

33:23.840 --> 33:26.640
- You all right?
<i>Very soon, I will be married.</i>

33:27.760 --> 33:30.600
<i>And a new order
will shape the rest of our lives.</i>

33:31.680 --> 33:33.400
<i>Everything will be different.</i>

33:34.240 --> 33:35.920
<i>Everything will be the same.</i>

33:37.720 --> 33:38.840
<i>For so long,</i>

33:39.520 --> 33:42.480
<i>I have attracted
certain forces that shaped my life.</i>

33:43.760 --> 33:45.480
<i>And I let them do their work.</i>

33:47.200 --> 33:49.920
<i>Sometimes they tear through me
like a hurricane.</i>

33:52.000 --> 33:55.040
<i>And sometimes they simply
shift the ground underneath me,</i>

33:56.080 --> 33:58.120
<i>so that I stand on different earth,</i>

33:59.640 --> 34:02.240
<i>and something, or someone,
has been swallowed up.</i>

34:04.320 --> 34:07.000
<i>And yet I always survive.</i>

34:09.440 --> 34:13.720
<i>So whatever happens between us,
I know that you, too, will survive.</i>

34:15.600 --> 34:17.560
<i>For that is what we have learned to do.</i>

34:20.200 --> 34:21.440
<i>And you will have me.</i>

34:22.960 --> 34:23.880
<i>Endlessly.</i>

34:25.960 --> 34:27.440
<i>Everything, always.</i>

34:34.880 --> 34:36.920
It's been a really tough year.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.240
Actually, it's been longer than that.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.000
Should I just start at the beginning?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.200
That's as good a place as any.

34:47.200 --> 34:48.240
Right.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.200
I've never done this,
so I don't really know the rules.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.400
Would it help to have some rules?

34:56.640 --> 34:57.480
Sorry?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.680
Is that something you feel you need?

35:10.680 --> 35:11.640
How strange.
