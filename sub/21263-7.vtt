WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.804
It was nasty, but I liked it.
She was like... Aah!

00:12.887 --> 00:15.432
-[Lisa] Guys.
-I was like, "No, yeah!"

00:16.016 --> 00:17.058
She was like...

00:17.142 --> 00:18.351
Okay.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.811
Alright, guys.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.312
I know we are all excited

00:21.396 --> 00:23.815
about our annual meeting
in the Cayman Islands...

00:23.898 --> 00:25.358
Yeah. I'm really excited.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.985
[bangs underneath table]

00:27.068 --> 00:29.320
That is a form of entertainment. Yeah.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.198
-Mrs. Turner, Brett's stroking it.
-Yeah. I can see that.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.660
Anyway, there has been
some incidents in the past,

00:35.744 --> 00:39.581
so I am legally required
to just go over our company guidelines

00:39.664 --> 00:41.875
about what we can and we cannot do.

00:41.958 --> 00:42.792
Shh. Uh, wait.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.377
[banging under the table]

00:44.461 --> 00:46.713
-What is that? I hear a wave.
-Do the wave.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.757
-[Lisa] Guys, you know what?
-[rapid banging]

00:48.840 --> 00:49.758
Guys...

00:49.841 --> 00:51.050
Just a general...

00:51.134 --> 00:52.218
I can do this.

00:53.261 --> 00:57.015
Guys, the faster we can get through
this stuff, the sooner we can talk...

00:57.098 --> 00:58.892
Everybody, come on Paul!

00:58.975 --> 01:00.643
[yells] Come on Paul, baby!

01:02.145 --> 01:03.354
In his eye!

01:03.438 --> 01:05.148
Blast his fucking eyes!

01:07.317 --> 01:08.777
-[bell rings]
-Market's open!

01:08.860 --> 01:10.862
Paul, one more long distance!

01:14.991 --> 01:17.368
No! You didn't save a bullet for me!

01:17.994 --> 01:20.455
God, it is gonna be a total shit show.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.625
-I'm gonna be stuck there all by myself.
-[chanting] Drink!

01:23.708 --> 01:25.001
[Nick] <i>Grand Cayman.</i>

01:25.084 --> 01:27.879
I feel so bad for you. That's so hard.

01:27.962 --> 01:31.216
I'm gonna be working, dipshit.
I know that is a hard concept for you.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.884
<i>Very funny.</i>

01:32.967 --> 01:35.011
Well, you're not gonna be working
the whole time.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.930
But I'm gonna be stuck
with a bunch of assholes.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.182
Alright, fine. Then I'll come.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.934
Yeah, great. I'll see you there.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.812
I'm serious.
Come on, I can clear my schedj, you know?

01:43.895 --> 01:46.272
You can just add one more asshole
to the bunch.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.608
[muffled yelling]

01:49.484 --> 01:51.069
Okay, sure. Why not?

01:51.152 --> 01:52.862
<i>Okay, great. I'll book my flight.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:53.988
See you soon.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.990
Great. Bye.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
[chanting] Caymans!

01:57.909 --> 01:59.452
Caymans!

01:59.536 --> 02:00.954
[groans]

02:04.415 --> 02:05.917
[sighs deeply]

02:06.501 --> 02:07.710
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, babe.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.296
Oh, my God, you made coffee. Thank God.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.298
Um...

02:12.382 --> 02:17.846
Hey, so I am not gonna be able
to meet your parents this weekend.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.765
-Something came up.
-What? We have tickets to <i>Kinky Boots</i>.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.517
I know. I know.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.895
I'm super bummed.
I was super looking forward to that.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.981
Well, can you change it?

02:28.064 --> 02:29.816
Nope. Sorry.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.780
[indie song playing]

02:43.872 --> 02:45.707
There is no way I'm getting into Harvard.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.126
When I was your age,
I said the same exact thing.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.545
But it was easier to get in back then.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.590
-True.
-I think you've got a real shot.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.009
Hi again. Sorry for the wait.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.177
Mrs. Wexler will be with you
in just a moment.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.637
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.847
[whispers] Show time.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.392
We gotta go.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.102
-What?
-We gotta go.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.104
-We gotta go right now. Come on.
-What?

03:08.187 --> 03:09.063
Wait! Dad!

03:11.274 --> 03:12.108
Chloe?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.863
That woman is a nightmare.
You do not want her doing your interview.

03:16.946 --> 03:17.780
You know her?

03:17.864 --> 03:21.034
Yeah, our firm did some work there
and we did not get along.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.660
[Chloe] I'm so screwed.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.661
No, you're not.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.205
I'm gonna take care of it.
Don't you worry.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.207
Okay, no, she's right.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.210
Thank you, sweetie. You saved the day.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.212
I love you. See you tonight.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.506
-[Jon] I love you!
-Bye!

03:39.010 --> 03:41.846
[Max] Totally sucks that Marianne
kicked you out of her place.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.057
It's okay.
It was time for us to go, anyway.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.934
-Hey, Ethan. Oh!
-Oh!

03:46.017 --> 03:48.853
[yells] He's got me right in the back!
Are you kidding me, skirt?

03:48.937 --> 03:51.773
This isn't exactly how I thought my life
was gonna turn out, you know?

03:52.106 --> 03:53.024
Right, buddy.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.027
But I like it.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.572
[repeating] Die!

03:59.656 --> 04:00.740
[Ethan shouts]

04:02.909 --> 04:04.494
[sighs softly] Okay.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.704
<i>-</i>[Ethan] <i>Hi, honey. We're working.</i>
-That's great.

04:06.788 --> 04:11.376
I just wanted to tell you that
I emailed everybody kind of a crazy idea

04:11.459 --> 04:14.212
but it could be really fun. Um...

04:14.295 --> 04:18.091
What if instead of just me
going to the Cayman Islands,

04:18.174 --> 04:20.843
what if we all went, like,
the whole friend group?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.388
-Are you serious?
-Do you like these pants on me?

04:23.471 --> 04:26.099
Felix said I couldn't pull them off,
but I think he's wrong.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.351
-It's super hot.
-Plane leaves in like two hours.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.145
It'll be like adult spring break.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.939
<i>No, I love the concept.</i>

04:33.022 --> 04:35.733
It's really cool
that Blackstool's paying for guests.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.610
<i>No, they wouldn't pay for everybody.</i>

04:37.694 --> 04:39.487
-We're going to the Caymans?
-Yeah.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.657
No, we would have to pay ourselves.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.617
So, honey, how much are the tickets?

04:44.701 --> 04:47.537
-$1,100 for economy.
-$1,100 for economy.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.998
-Ooh. Wow. That's--
<i>-We can't afford that.</i>

04:50.081 --> 04:51.541
Marianne definitely can't.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.168
I can't go. And we gotta do the thing.
We gotta work.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.629
<i>Sam probably can't make it.</i>
<i>She's probably busy.</i>

04:56.713 --> 05:00.133
This was a dumb idea. Dumb Lisa.
[chuckles]

05:00.466 --> 05:03.136
Oh, my God,
I just looked on my desk computer,

05:03.219 --> 05:06.931
there's an email from Nick
and he said he's coming!

05:07.640 --> 05:09.559
I'm sorry, he is? Nick is going?

05:09.642 --> 05:10.518
<i>Yeah!</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:11.811
Huh? Wow!

05:11.894 --> 05:14.647
Yeah, so I'll see you in a week

05:14.731 --> 05:16.524
and I'll be in touch.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.692
<i>Right.</i>

05:17.775 --> 05:19.986
-Have fun.
<i>-Okay. Bye!</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:25.241
What just happened there?
Felt like kind of a weird vibe.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.743
Nick is going?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.495
That is advanced-level Lisa ninjutsu.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.914
See, we had a fight after the wedding

05:31.998 --> 05:35.710
and now she's punishing me by going to
the Caribbean with somebody who isn't me.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.171
And someone she used to date.
Don't forget that.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.255
Yeah.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.468
[cell phone rings]

05:46.220 --> 05:47.096
Hey.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.516
-I just saw Anka Wexler.
-Who's that again?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.227
Our stupid kiss from the other night

05:53.311 --> 05:55.980
just derailed
my step-daughter's Harvard interview,

05:56.064 --> 05:59.025
not to mention
almost destroyed my marriage.

05:59.108 --> 06:03.613
Now I have to bring Chloe to Harvard
to do her interview there!

06:04.238 --> 06:05.698
Wait, you're going to Cambridge?

06:05.990 --> 06:08.701
Oh, my God. I haven't been in so long.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.827
Could you imagine--

06:09.911 --> 06:12.330
I know what you're thinking
and the answer is no.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.750
We would get separate hotel rooms.
Let's all go. It'll be fun.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.044
I think it's a terrible idea
and you shouldn't go.

06:18.127 --> 06:22.465
Max, there is a werewolf exhibit
and I can't afford to miss it.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.884
Does this werewolf exhibit actually exist?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.427
Ethan?

06:26.511 --> 06:29.222
-Just look at me and tell me--
-Fine. It's not real.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.224
I want to go to Cambridge. Is that wrong?

06:31.307 --> 06:34.060
Lisa's gonna go to the Caymans
to punish me. Why can't I have fun?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.978
Just tell me that. We can work there.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.315
Widener Library has great Medieval
history. We'll use that as research.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.233
You're in?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.526
-I'm in!
-We're doing it!

06:41.609 --> 06:43.277
-[both] We're going to Cambridge.
-Let's do it!

06:43.361 --> 06:44.946
-Whoo! Cambridge!
-Cambridge!

06:45.029 --> 06:46.030
[Max mimics gun shots]

06:46.114 --> 06:47.448
[high-pitched chant]

06:47.824 --> 06:49.158
-That's--
-That's racist.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.201
I think... Yeah.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.828
-I shouldn't do that.
-Too far.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.960
I am so excited to be here.

06:59.043 --> 07:03.506
I haven't been to the beach in years,
and I always get burned, but I love it.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.966
[Nick chuckles]

07:05.466 --> 07:09.595
Paul! You are a sight for sore eyes! Oh!

07:09.679 --> 07:11.639
-It's so good to see you!
-Hey, Lisa.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.392
Nick, this is Paul. Paul, Nick.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.353
Paul works at Blackstool.
He's the only other nice person.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.604
Okay. Alright. Cool.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.983
It's insane how long
you have worked there. You should quit.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.903
-I pay a lot in alimony.
-[Nick] Oh.

07:26.028 --> 07:30.074
So don't get divorced because even when
you think you are, you're really not.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.954
Well, we are gonna
get out of our plane clothes,

07:35.037 --> 07:36.998
get into a bathing suit, get in that pool.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.083
-Let's hit it.
-Right? See you there.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.626
-Alright.
-Cannonball!

07:40.710 --> 07:41.961
-What?
-Right?

07:42.628 --> 07:43.880
Are you okay?

07:43.963 --> 07:47.008
-[Ethan] Unbelievable, man.
-[Max] You lucked out.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.094
-Like you've lived here your whole life.
-It's embracing us! Welcome home!

07:50.178 --> 07:54.015
It even smells familiar.
Oh, God, it's so amazing to be here!

07:54.098 --> 07:57.143
Please, guys, no nostalgia tour.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.519
Just spare us.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.355
Now I feel like
I have to talk about nostalgia.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.400
I gotta get at this hacky sack.
I'm just gonna get into this.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.152
Just ride the snake. Watch this.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.821
Okay, I was a little high. I'm sorry.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.865
-Almost got--
-Stay away from us.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.200
[Max] Whoa! Whoa!

08:12.283 --> 08:15.077
[Sam] Hey, I don't think
these are college kids.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.413
What is this, <i>West Side Story</i>?
What is this?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.333
-It's never been a safe area.
-I remember that now.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.418
-[Sam] Stay out of this area.
-[Max] Stay up here.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.462
[Sam] Just head to the hotel.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.463
[Max] Just there...

08:27.381 --> 08:28.591
Oh, wow. Okay.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.843
Well, we're definitely
going to this lunch.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.388
I am legitimately excited
to see Coolio perform.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.142
Yeah. Coolio's one of those
interesting performers.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.561
Um...

08:40.978 --> 08:43.189
Yeah, very. Uh...

08:43.272 --> 08:46.108
Well, I'm here for a few days.
What are you up for?

08:46.192 --> 08:50.112
There's, like, this yoga morning thing
that sounds kind of interesting.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.030
Uh-huh.

08:51.113 --> 08:55.535
They have a great golf course. We could
get some plaid pants, hit the links.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.037
Golf is interesting.
Is Tiger Woods still good?

08:58.913 --> 08:59.956
[Nick] Uh...

09:00.581 --> 09:01.791
Ti... What?

09:05.419 --> 09:06.796
[soft moaning]

09:07.755 --> 09:09.382
What... is happening?

09:15.054 --> 09:16.305
No! Nope.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.683
[Lisa sighs]

09:19.016 --> 09:20.393
[both moan]

09:20.685 --> 09:21.686
[exhales deeply]

09:25.815 --> 09:28.693
Uh, Tiger Woods is not good anymore,
some other guy is.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.945
-Okay, thanks for clarifying that.
-Yeah.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.202
[Max whispers] Hey.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.371
I found two of your books.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.331
Oh, my God. Put those away.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.666
Check this out.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.251
Look at this guy.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.004
Oh, my gosh.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.214
-Where is that guy?
-Oh, my God.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.757
Look at that head of hair.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.302
-Look at me.
-And you know the weirdest part?

09:54.385 --> 09:57.930
Look, this picture was taken
two years later.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.807
What happened?

09:59.890 --> 10:02.059
That was a rough two years, man,
I'll tell you what.

10:02.143 --> 10:06.188
Look at this. Ugh. But it doesn't matter
because this is the past.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.566
And right now, this is the present,

10:08.649 --> 10:11.152
and we're gonna write the shit
out of this wolf book.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.321
-We're gonna make millions of dollars.
-Yes. Absolutely.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.698
Then I can go back to writing stuff
that feeds my soul.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.575
-You know what I love?
-What?

10:17.658 --> 10:20.328
I love that in this time of computers
and Internet

10:20.411 --> 10:22.705
and instant information
at your fingertips,

10:22.788 --> 10:26.917
that we're in an actual research library
just, like, getting back to the source.

10:27.001 --> 10:31.339
Yeah. It's like there's no substitute
for a top-flight research library.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.090
Guess what I found online.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.593
You're on?
I couldn't get any service down here.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.178
No, Wi-Fi, get on the Wi-Fi.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.679
Is it Harvard Guest?

10:38.763 --> 10:41.015
-It's a Boingo hotspot.
-Gotcha.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.517
-You know how there were witch trials?
-Mm-hmm.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.021
There were actual werewolf trials
in Medieval times.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.439
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.358
Wait. Werewolves are real?

10:51.525 --> 10:52.401
Sorry.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.154
Wait, what site is that on?
Where did you even find that?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.405
It's on Wikipedia.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.617
I just googled werewolves.
I just typed in "werewolves."

10:59.700 --> 11:00.743
You googled it?

11:00.826 --> 11:03.788
I know, we should've thought about that
a long time ago.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.165
My point is Peter Stumpp. Listen to this.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.251
They called him The Werewolf of Bedburg.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.171
-No one's done anything with it?
-No one's done anything.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.382
-Really?
-Yes! You know what we should do?

11:14.465 --> 11:19.261
Jasmine shouldn't escape. She should get
caught and then be put on a wolf trial.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.847
-[gasps] I love that.
-It gives the whole thing a spine.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.308
-That's our ending.
-The wolf trial should happen--

11:24.392 --> 11:28.312
When there's a full moon...
and the prosecutor turns into a werewolf.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.856
Like, literally, he's just going,
"I object..."

11:30.940 --> 11:33.484
[makes strained werewolf noises]

11:34.068 --> 11:37.488
And the judge throws the gavel at him
and he eats it or fetches it.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.698
-Genius!
-That's the book! And we call it...

11:39.782 --> 11:42.243
I got it.
<i>Peter Stumpp: Werewolf of Bedburg.</i>

11:42.326 --> 11:45.246
-We just call it <i>Wolf Trials</i>.
-<i>Wolf Trials of Bedburg</i>.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.956
Just <i>Wolf Trials</i>.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.334
We don't want it to be generic.
We want it to be as specific as possible.

11:50.418 --> 11:54.088
Have you ever heard of a wolf trial?
We found out about it two seconds ago.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.674
Duly noted. You got me, that's true.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.175
Right? That's the book!

11:58.259 --> 12:00.136
-We cracked it!
-We cracked it! Yes!

12:01.387 --> 12:02.763
[whispered chanting] <i>Wolf Trials!</i>

12:03.597 --> 12:05.516
[snarling]

12:05.599 --> 12:06.934
[growling]

12:07.643 --> 12:09.812
[both howl]

12:09.895 --> 12:13.065
[Ethan] You, sir,
are guilty of cracking the Wolf Trial!

12:13.149 --> 12:17.069
I accept the punishment
because I confess to the crime!

12:19.405 --> 12:21.073
-Duck.
-Duck, yeah.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.616
Duck.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.035
[rhythmic groaning]

12:25.119 --> 12:26.120
Goose!

12:28.914 --> 12:31.292
You have never had pizza

12:31.375 --> 12:32.793
that's this close.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.798
-What do you think?
-Not bad.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.758
[Max] Yes, not bad! You get it!

12:39.842 --> 12:42.470
-I feel I'm at the height of my powers.
-You are, buddy.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.387
Right?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.057
[groans]

12:47.141 --> 12:48.601
-Juggle!
-Alright, let's...

12:48.684 --> 12:50.811
Oh, my God, it's a nice day.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.979
[Ethan laughs]

12:52.438 --> 12:53.314
Whoo!

12:53.397 --> 12:56.358
Yeah! Whoo!

12:56.442 --> 12:58.110
I could go all night.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.864
Finished yet?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.532
No, not yet.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.078
I'm just kind of smooshing it up
against you.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.040
-Are you starving?
-Yes.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.502
-Let's go get some food.
-I love that idea.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.838
Recharge!

13:18.214 --> 13:19.423
[thudding]

13:20.007 --> 13:21.300
Are you okay?

13:22.384 --> 13:23.219
Yeah.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.888
-I nailed it. This is the best day.
-You crushed it.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.349
-You crushed it.
-Thank you. You're the best guy.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.227
Thank you. I love you, Max.
I'm so glad we got to do this.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.521
-We got stuff done, you know?
-We did!

13:33.604 --> 13:35.272
-And you know what?
-What's that?

13:35.356 --> 13:38.609
-You know what Felix would always say?
-No, what?

13:38.692 --> 13:41.028
He always thought that I had

13:41.111 --> 13:43.906
the biggest... crush on you.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.493
Is that wild?

13:48.702 --> 13:51.288
-Yeah.
-It just drove him crazy.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.750
-He was talking about it all the time.
-Yes, okay.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.377
That's wild, right?

13:56.460 --> 13:58.128
-Like, us.
-Nothing going on here.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.673
Not even for an accident.
It wouldn't be for real.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.300
-I would make sure.
-One night we were like, "Uh-oh!"

14:03.384 --> 14:05.886
No. It wouldn't happen, buddy, I promise.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.680
-Oh, man!
-Alright. Here we go.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.306
-You know what else?
-What?

14:09.390 --> 14:12.768
Felix was saying that
I deserve credit for the book.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.936
What?

14:14.019 --> 14:16.146
He thinks I should stand up for myself.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.316
[scoffs] Isn't that wild? That's wild.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.986
Do you really want to have
this conversation now?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.488
No, I just think it's wild!

14:24.572 --> 14:27.199
I think there's a lot of thoughts
going on in your head.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.619
-I have really got a lot going on!
-You should probably go to sleep.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.997
-Maybe one. Shall we...
-No, we should not.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.498
Let's go to sleep.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.542
-I love you, buddy.
-And I love you.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.835
[growls]

14:39.920 --> 14:42.131
Felix also thinks you're having an affair.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.220
With Marianne.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.140
[Ethan exhales]

14:51.223 --> 14:52.600
[soft groan]

14:55.269 --> 14:57.646
-Oh. Sit here?
-Yeah.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.442
Oh... Jeez, that is tender.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.319
Yes, it's hard to sit.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.696
-Really--
-Whoo. Yeah.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.575
-Good day.
-Hello! Good morning! Afternoon!

15:09.658 --> 15:13.245
-What time is it? I don't even know!
-Would you like to start with drinks?

15:13.329 --> 15:16.165
Drinks? No. Lord, no.
No, but I am starving, Desmond.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.750
I'm gonna order right away.

15:17.833 --> 15:22.254
I'm gonna get everything
from the watermelon salad down.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.632
I will take all of that
and whatever you want.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.592
Do you want food or some drinks or...

15:26.675 --> 15:29.178
I think that's probably plenty
for the both of us.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.430
-Sounds good. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.475
-I love your smile. What a lovely smile.
-Thank you.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.353
-Yeah.
-What is going on with you?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.772
-What do you mean?
-I feel like you're on cocaine.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.857
-I'm not on...
-It's like you're sped up.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.861
I'm just having a good time. I'm excited
to be here. This is the best vacation.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
It's so fun. We're gonna play golf.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.784
Then I'll go to a conference
on how derivatives are making a comeback.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.828
-[man] Whatup, dicks? How y'all feeling?
-Great. Oh.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.247
Sorry, is that the guy you talk about?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.540
-The Degrasso guy?
-Who?

15:58.624 --> 16:01.085
-Oh, yes. It is. Mm-hmm.
-A co-worker, right?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.963
-We gotta get him over.
-We don't need to. We can just...

16:04.046 --> 16:06.256
No, definitely. Hey.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.592
-Hey. Hi, excuse me.
-Yeah?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.970
-A word?
-Oh! Hey!

16:11.053 --> 16:14.556
-What's up?
-Hey. Oh. We're gonna do that.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.476
-Yeah.
-Is this your husband?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.520
-No.
-[Nick] Nope.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.482
No. I'm from the SEC.
We've got a situation here.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.736
Okay, you're out of your jurisdiction.
This is the fucking Grand Caymans.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.365
This is a British protectorate,
so your fucking bullshit, rinky-dinky,

16:31.448 --> 16:35.202
fucking pussy-assed, cunt-licking,
fucking bullshit SEC law

16:35.285 --> 16:37.079
doesn't mean fucking shit here.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.666
I got a US passport and a Swiss one,
so fuck you!

16:41.208 --> 16:42.334
What's your name, dog?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.169
Legally you have to tell me your name.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.671
My name?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.589
My name is Mike Fuckface.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.135
I don't know Mike Fuck...

16:51.969 --> 16:54.847
Yeah, you do.
You just got fucked in the face.

16:57.099 --> 17:01.895
-He got you. It was a bet.
-I was like... [mimics himself]

17:01.979 --> 17:03.313
-I know.
-What the fuck?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.857
You just roided out.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.192
Who are you, though?

17:07.901 --> 17:09.153
-Who are you?
-This is...

17:09.236 --> 17:11.238
We're old friends. This is Nick.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.448
-Yeah.
-[Lisa] Yeah.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.033
I thought you were married.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.868
I am.

17:15.951 --> 17:16.785
Uh-oh!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.912
I'm not a cheater. I don't cheat.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.622
Yeah, I'm not a cheater, either.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.254
You see that. Well, listen,
what happens in Cayman stays in Cayman.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.798
-I don't think they say that.
-No, I think they do.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.469
-When you're down here, you do.
-Okay, I gotta go, but you...

17:33.552 --> 17:35.679
-Yes.
-You and me are, like, the same.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.016
The only thing that separates me and you,
four inches of dick.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.685
See ya, dog.
You hear what he fuckin' said?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.228
[Nick] Boy, you're right.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.397
That guy is a psychopath.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.817
What's up?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.278
I am... I'm gonna go... uh...

17:52.196 --> 17:53.655
to the gym.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.408
What? We just ordered all that food.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.500
-So much isn't here anymore.
-I know.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.001
-The Tasty.
-Yeah.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.879
-Tommy's.
-Pizzeria Uno. Store 24.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.256
I mean, all the good chains. Come on!

18:11.340 --> 18:13.092
But you know what I bet still is here?

18:13.175 --> 18:16.470
Please, no. I promise you,
our initials aren't still there.

18:16.553 --> 18:20.057
Yes, we have to go look!
Dunster's on the way.

18:20.140 --> 18:24.019
Dunster's on the way?
It's not your dorm anymore.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.397
-It's forever my dorm.
-It hasn't been in over 20 years.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.776
[getting high-pitched] But let's just
take a look and see if we can get in.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.237
[Sam high-pitched squeaks]

18:33.320 --> 18:35.531
What are you doing?
Are you a baby dolphin?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.282
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.789
You know when you get off a boat
and you have sea legs?

18:43.872 --> 18:46.291
Right now, I feel like I have hump waist.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.793
Can't stop humping.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.130
We did it a lot of times, right?

18:52.881 --> 18:55.300
-Shouldn't you be wearing shoes?
-I'm fine.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.010
-Barefoot's not good.
-I'm fine.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.805
I don't think they disinfect
the wheel thing.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.933
You know, could you just go work out
somewhere else?

19:03.016 --> 19:06.395
I don't know why you're working out.
We just got a seven-hour workout.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.189
-You know, like--
-I know, it's just distracting.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.860
-Is this distracting?
-Nick, come on. Stop.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.822
-Oh.
-[buttons beep]

19:16.905 --> 19:19.408
Yes! These rope things are awesome!

19:19.491 --> 19:22.077
I feel like Alfred Molina
in, like, <i>Spider-Man</i>.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.496
I'm Doc Ock!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.790
Lisa, look.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.500
Lisa, look.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.377
Lisa, look.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.628
-Lisa, look!
-What?

19:31.712 --> 19:32.546
Look!

19:32.629 --> 19:33.755
[Lisa yells]

19:34.381 --> 19:35.632
Holy shit!

19:35.716 --> 19:37.968
-Are you alright?
-Get away from me!

19:39.928 --> 19:40.888
Uh...

19:41.180 --> 19:43.724
-I think you really hurt yourself there.
-Oh, God.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.933
It's fine.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.270
-No, you can barely put any weight on it.
-It's okay.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.065
-No, I'll take you to the hospital.
-No, you've done enough already, okay?

19:52.941 --> 19:56.069
-What does that mean?
-I don't have to go to the hospital. Ow.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.154
Ow!

19:57.237 --> 19:58.322
It's fine.

19:59.031 --> 19:59.990
Lisa.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.366
Hey.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.540
[whispers] Hey.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.209
Tall guy. Tall guy.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.336
Tall guy with the hoodie and the backpack.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.423
No, short guy with the hoodie
and the back...

20:17.007 --> 20:19.134
Girl, girl with the hoodie
and the backpack.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.344
[Sam] Hoodie girl.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.638
Hoodie girl.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.556
Sam.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.988
[soft music playing on radio]

20:43.033 --> 20:45.494
-[whispers] My God.
-Wow.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.246
Old-timey people kissing.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.748
Been owning walls for 20 years.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.335
-[sighs]
-I can't get over these beds.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.046
I mean, they're children's beds.

20:56.129 --> 20:59.299
Can you believe we would sleep through
the night together in one of these?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.718
Unbelievable.
Look, everything's the same.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.762
The tapestries over the beds.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.681
The shitty halogen lamp.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.226
There's hair everywhere,
so clearly this room belongs to a girl.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.560
True fact.

21:10.644 --> 21:15.357
And, uh... wait, I want to spread
a little more cheese upon this moment.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.569
You're as beautiful as the day I met you.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.905
Even more.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.657
That's not true,

21:23.740 --> 21:26.493
but I will pass the compliment along
to my beauty team.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.162
Alright, come here.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.209
Wow. There it is.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.128
-Look at that.
-Yeah.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.548
It's so weird, after all these years
and we're still there.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.551
SD and ET.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.596
That's them. That's the intruders.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.806
Oh, my...

21:47.889 --> 21:49.850
No rape. There's no rape happening here.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.935
No rape!
You can clearly see I'm not raping!

21:52.978 --> 21:54.771
[in Caribbean accent]
I got your Coke, man!

21:55.897 --> 21:57.816
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.403
Aw... So sorry about your leg.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.697
I hope this didn't, like,
ruin your work trip.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.408
You don't have to apologize.
It's not your fault.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.662
I hope you don't think this whole thing
was, like, a mistake, you know.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.748
Because I really enjoyed our...

22:13.999 --> 22:16.668
I don't know,
whatever you want to call it, experience.

22:16.752 --> 22:20.422
-Mmm.
-You are one of, like, if not the most...

22:22.632 --> 22:25.010
important person in my life,

22:25.093 --> 22:27.721
you know, female or... male.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.349
-I mean, just any, you know.
-I get it. Uh...

22:30.432 --> 22:32.434
I just, I don't want to talk about it.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.686
I'm sure you can understand that.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.856
Yeah. No, I do. I definitely do.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.278
-I just want to add, like, um...
-Mm-hmm?

22:43.445 --> 22:44.613
I really care about you.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.406
You are so special to me

22:46.490 --> 22:49.242
and I don't have more than I care about.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.660
I don't know how you do this.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.412
I know, it's so...

22:53.413 --> 22:54.998
I don't know how you do this.

22:55.082 --> 22:59.252
How do you just have random,
meaningless hook-ups?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.546
I mean, it's soul-crushing.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.882
I mean, you just feel terrible after.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.518
Alright, well, how's your leg?

23:16.311 --> 23:18.146
-Really hurts.
-Good.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.066
I'm gonna put this...

23:22.192 --> 23:24.611
right over here, just out of reach.

23:24.694 --> 23:27.656
I hope you don't accidentally
fuck some stranger

23:27.739 --> 23:29.491
on the way to hobble over and get it.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.327
Come on! You came here for one reason.

23:32.410 --> 23:35.455
-What? I didn't plan this!
-Why else would you come here?

23:35.539 --> 23:39.251
I was excited to go to Coolio
and then you fucked my dick off!

23:39.334 --> 23:40.961
I invited the whole friend group!

23:41.044 --> 23:43.505
I have proof! It's all on an email.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.174
This isn't fucking Watergate.
There's no paper trail.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.886
Yes, there is a paper trail. There's
an email right here. You're cc'd on it.

23:49.970 --> 23:54.015
You called me and then emailed everybody
to cover your tracks like some psychopath.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.684
Get out of here, mon!

23:55.767 --> 23:56.768
Get out of here, mon!

23:56.852 --> 24:00.355
It's... get out of here, <i>mahn.</i>
That's how you say it!

24:01.106 --> 24:02.149
Samantha.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.067
Sam.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.654
I'm sorry that I made us go in there.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.489
You didn't make me do anything.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.618
I make poor choices whenever
I'm around you and I can't seem to stop.

24:14.619 --> 24:18.331
That is the second time we've been stopped
by the cops since you came back.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.417
-I know.
-That is not normal.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.712
It is for me, okay?
It happens all the time.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.047
But I guess
that's a different conversation.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.758
Ethan... [softly] Jesus.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.218
Is it...

24:30.302 --> 24:34.181
Is it okay if I walk you home? Don't walk
too fast, they'll think I'm following you.

24:34.264 --> 24:37.017
-[music playing loudly nearby]
-[indistinct chatter]

24:44.733 --> 24:46.276
-What?
-This is Chloe's room.

24:46.359 --> 24:49.571
-It sounds like she's having a party.
-Does she know anybody in Cambridge?

24:49.654 --> 24:52.866
Chloe can summon boarding school friends
from anywhere in the world.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.414
Oh, my God.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.000
They're all so young.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.545
Yeah.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.593
This part of our lives needs to be over.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.846
What? Why? Why?

25:17.641 --> 25:19.392
Because I'm in love with you.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.813
Don't say it, okay?

25:24.397 --> 25:26.399
The whole thing is don't say it.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.281
You don't want to say it
because what then?

25:36.534 --> 25:38.328
Because I don't want to say goodbye.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.997
Me neither.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.709
I'll see you on the plane tomorrow.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.711
And at your birthday party.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.714
-And Marianne's play.
-What? She's got another play?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.132
It's <i>Annie</i>.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.093
But the entire thing is whispered

25:53.176 --> 25:55.720
and Annie is played by a 90-year-old man.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.015
And I'm gonna regret asking this, but...

26:00.016 --> 26:01.518
who plays Daddy Warbucks?

26:01.601 --> 26:03.728
-A 12-year-old girl.
-Of course.

26:10.735 --> 26:11.653
Weird.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.072
[slow rock song plays]

26:40.348 --> 26:41.433
[sighs]

26:43.310 --> 26:44.436
Chloe, what the hell?

26:44.519 --> 26:46.813
We got an interview tomorrow.
Everybody out.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.982
[Chloe] Sam, come on. This is not cool.

26:49.065 --> 26:52.360
I'm the coolest.
Everyone still has to leave.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.197
-So I said...
-[Lisa] That's great. Thanks.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.534
...I don't think you're hearing me
and I think they speak English here.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.535
You know?

27:00.618 --> 27:01.953
What's up, gimpy?

27:02.537 --> 27:04.706
You've been so pouty
since your boyfie left.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.791
[all laugh]

27:08.543 --> 27:09.878
[yelling]

27:12.964 --> 27:14.924
What are you doing?! What are you doing?!

27:15.508 --> 27:17.510
Oh, is it not clear?

27:18.511 --> 27:21.389
[shouting] You guys are a bunch
of soulless animals.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.518
Let me put this in words
that you're gonna understand, okay?

27:25.602 --> 27:29.022
Choke on my big fat fucking cock!

27:30.607 --> 27:31.733
I quit!

27:33.234 --> 27:34.069
Yes!

27:35.153 --> 27:36.863
-Wait.
-What?

27:39.282 --> 27:40.867
I'm really sorry to hear that.

27:42.202 --> 27:46.331
You're a great attorney and I will be
proud to write you a recommendation letter

27:46.414 --> 27:48.124
or endorse you on LinkedIn.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.752
This job isn't for everyone.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.088
Thanks.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.341
I... might take you up on that.

28:00.387 --> 28:04.432
Clap for her.
Jesus, she took a brave stand.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.142
Fucking clap.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.228
[rock song playing]

28:10.105 --> 28:11.731
Good job. That was good.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.903
That was fucking insane.
[laughs] What was that, right?
