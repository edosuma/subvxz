who handles adoptions,

09:13.333 --> 09:17.703

considering adopting.

09:17.737 --> 09:20.306
Which we're not.

09:20.340 --> 09:21.573
- Are we?
- Well, no.

- No, we haven't been.
- Right.

09:23.810 --> 09:26.045

09:26.079 --> 09:29.715

who's seven months pregnant,

09:29.749 --> 09:32.484

adopting her little girl

09:32.519 --> 09:37.056
had some kind of change of heart, and so...

09:38.792 --> 09:40.993
So...

started trying to get pregnant,

28:30.208 --> 28:31.842
This is a summer business.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.543
It seems ideal that during the school year,

28:33.578 --> 28:37.347
you can live wherever Sashi can excel.

28:37.381 --> 28:42.285
Honestly, I've been more focused
lately on the here and now.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.588
Oh. Tell me about it.

28:44.622 --> 28:46.623
Just some custody details

28:46.657 --> 28:48.758
I need to settle with Sashi's father.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.493
Hmm.

28:50.528 --> 28:53.797
Well, I won't pry until
we have more champagne.

28:56.434 --> 28:57.601
[both chuckle]

28:59.537 --> 29:01.271
(Evan) Check, check, check, check.

29:01.305 --> 29:04.507
Hi. If I may have your attention, guys.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.610
So we've reached the live auction section

29:06.644 --> 29:08.812
of tonight's festivities,

29:08.846 --> 29:10.280
and I just wanted to warm you up.

29:10.314 --> 29:12.682
He's not here yet, but I wanted
to just talk a little bit...

29:12.717 --> 29:15.118
Thank you again for your
generous contribution.

29:15.152 --> 29:16.119
Yeah. About that...

29:16.153 --> 29:17.487
I was surprised you were willing,

29:17.521 --> 29:19.055
but I admire you for it.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.157
I've been working on myself too this summer,

29:21.192 --> 29:23.560
getting out of my comfort zone.

29:23.594 --> 29:25.929
Growth is good.

29:25.963 --> 29:30.033
Jeremiah, did you just handle me?

29:30.067 --> 29:31.134
Oh, my God, there he is.

29:31.168 --> 29:33.169
Ladies and gentlemen, the man of the hour,

29:33.204 --> 29:35.739
the Hamptons' most beloved concierge doctor

29:35.773 --> 29:39.175
and biggest uncaught whale of
a catch... trust me here...

29:39.210 --> 29:42.712
my brother, Dr. "Call Me Hank" Lawson.

29:42.747 --> 29:43.980
Put your hands together for him.

29:44.015 --> 29:44.981
Give him a warm welcome.

29:45.016 --> 29:47.050
- Whoo-hoo!
- [chuckles]

29:47.084 --> 29:48.852
Thank you.

29:48.886 --> 29:50.153
Thank you so much.

29:50.187 --> 29:51.855
So first of all, thank you
so much for being here.

29:51.889 --> 29:53.156
Sure.

29:53.190 --> 29:55.492
And, ladies, I want you
to feast your eyes on...

29:55.526 --> 29:56.493
and not only ladies.

29:56.527 --> 29:58.461
Ladies and gentlemen, anyone can bid,

29:58.496 --> 30:01.531
either on behalf of yourself
or a friend or neighbor

30:01.565 --> 30:03.133
as long as they're single.

30:03.167 --> 30:08.138
But I'd like to start the
bidding now at $5,000.

30:08.172 --> 30:09.506
Okay, that's way too much money.

30:09.540 --> 30:10.707
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

30:10.741 --> 30:14.144
$5,000.

30:14.178 --> 30:15.912
So just because these diseases are rare

30:15.947 --> 30:18.481
doesn't mean that your donations have to be.

30:18.516 --> 30:19.916
Do I hear 5,000?

30:19.951 --> 30:22.652
- I'll bid 100.
- 100.

30:22.687 --> 30:24.087
100 bucks.

30:24.121 --> 30:25.722
100,000.

30:25.756 --> 30:27.190
Sold!

30:27.224 --> 30:29.659
Uh, unless anyone else wants to bid.

30:29.694 --> 30:33.997
Evan, take the yes.

30:34.031 --> 30:36.466
Sold to the beautiful Ms. Houston.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.735
Thank you so much.

30:38.769 --> 30:40.637
[applause]

30:40.671 --> 30:44.074
[classical music]

30:44.108 --> 30:46.543
Donations are exceeding our expectations.

30:46.577 --> 30:48.111
It's bad luck to count the box office

30:48.145 --> 30:49.746
before the curtain falls, Jeremiah.

30:49.780 --> 30:53.783
That said, we're killing it.

30:53.818 --> 30:57.854
Oh, by the way, after your call,

30:57.888 --> 30:59.723
I mentioned Jim McGuire to another rep.

30:59.757 --> 31:02.592
He'd heard that Jim didn't leave Criteria.

31:02.626 --> 31:04.661
He was fired.

31:04.695 --> 31:07.364
- Are you saying Jim lied?
- Not necessarily.

31:07.398 --> 31:08.865
When a high-profile employee exits,

31:08.899 --> 31:10.834
there's often a rush to control the news.

31:10.868 --> 31:13.003
This isn't news. This happened last year.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.171
My guy said last month.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.840
Does that matter?

31:16.874 --> 31:20.210
You can't build a new sequencer in a month.

31:20.244 --> 31:21.945
- Oh.
- I'll handle it.

31:21.979 --> 31:24.848
Evan, Mr. Thayer has a question
about the tax implications

31:24.882 --> 31:25.849
of an estate donation.

31:25.883 --> 31:28.351
Okay. I'll catch up with you.

31:32.623 --> 31:35.692
Thank you for your generous donation.

31:35.726 --> 31:38.728
So now can I get more pills?

31:38.763 --> 31:41.331
Uh, how do you feel about dinner instead?

31:41.365 --> 31:43.099
[chuckles]

31:43.134 --> 31:46.336
I have been known to
have dinner on occasion.

31:46.370 --> 31:49.039
Okay. So I'm sorry if I'm awkward at this.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.107
It's just that I've never
been bought before.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.575
No, I should hope not.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.978
- I don't go for used.
- Yeah.

31:55.012 --> 31:56.579
Well, thank you for saving
me the embarrassment

31:56.614 --> 31:58.314
of not fetching top dollar.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.750
Well, honestly, I feel fortunate to be able

32:00.785 --> 32:03.853
to support such an extraordinary cause.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.622
I'm a sucker for hope.

32:05.656 --> 32:07.824
Medicine brings hope to the hopeless.

32:07.858 --> 32:09.559
Well, we try.

32:09.593 --> 32:12.896
I have a feeling you do more than try.

32:12.930 --> 32:16.599
Am I right, Hank?

32:16.634 --> 32:19.169
I got to go.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.378
(Quami) I enjoy a good polo match

32:28.412 --> 32:31.347
as much as any previously colonized elite,

32:31.382 --> 32:34.184
and I would never presume
to pass judgment on the IQ

32:34.218 --> 32:35.552
of an underwear model.

32:35.586 --> 32:40.690
But any man who'd let you
slip through his fingers

32:40.724 --> 32:42.025
must be an utter fool.

32:42.059 --> 32:43.560
[laughs]

32:43.594 --> 32:44.961
There was no slipping.

32:44.995 --> 32:46.996
I just realized I was looking for more.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.001
Look here.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.144
Sorry.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.179
Sorry.

33:06.050 --> 33:09.686
I need to tell you.

33:09.720 --> 33:14.424
Contrary to what you've
heard, I am seeing someone.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.226
It's at the early stages,

33:16.260 --> 33:19.229
even though we've known
each other for a long time,

33:19.263 --> 33:23.700
and neither of us has been ready
to commit or even go public yet.

33:23.734 --> 33:24.701
[sighs]

33:24.735 --> 33:27.036
It's complicated.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.709
I'm not discouraged by competition,

33:32.743 --> 33:34.244
and I'll take it as a positive sign

33:34.278 --> 33:35.945
that you were curious
enough to let me kiss you

33:35.980 --> 33:37.614
before revealing your status.

33:40.451 --> 33:41.718
You're not gonna make this easy for me,

33:41.752 --> 33:43.853
are you?

33:43.888 --> 33:45.221
It's good to be Prince.

33:45.256 --> 33:46.823
[laughs]

33:54.365 --> 33:56.799
- Okay.
- Thanks.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.334
Hey, you came.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.836
Can you stay for the performance?

33:59.870 --> 34:00.970
I wouldn't miss it.

34:01.005 --> 34:02.772
I was really glad to hear you stuck it out.

34:02.806 --> 34:05.141
Are you kidding? I don't run away.

34:05.176 --> 34:07.243
This is my life.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.012
And I expect great things from you.

34:09.045 --> 34:10.847
You sound like you've
already met my parents.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.181
[laughs] Are they here?

34:12.216 --> 34:13.882
And they want to thank you.

34:13.918 --> 34:14.918
Come on. I'll introduce you.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.319
Yeah, of course we will,

34:16.353 --> 34:19.722
but, um, before we do,

34:19.757 --> 34:21.591
I've been thinking.

34:21.625 --> 34:23.092
In light of what happened last night...

34:23.127 --> 34:24.661
You mean my getting beat up?

34:24.695 --> 34:28.197
And knowing that I left
you feeling hopeless.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.199
It's okay.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.266
Not for me, it's not.

34:31.302 --> 34:33.703
See, doctors weigh risks all the time.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.539
It's part of our job, and
I've started to realize

34:36.574 --> 34:39.775
that the risk factors in
your life are significant.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.844
More than I imagined at first.

34:41.879 --> 34:44.380
You're a brave girl.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.616
If you still want to try taking estrogen,

34:46.650 --> 34:47.850
I'll work with you

34:47.885 --> 34:52.021
at a lower dose combined with
continued blood thinners.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.623
We'll find you a great specialist

34:53.657 --> 34:56.458
and see if we can find a tolerable dose.

34:56.493 --> 34:58.228
And if we can't?

34:58.262 --> 34:59.963
There are other courses to consider,

34:59.997 --> 35:04.367
like implanting an IVC filter
if clotting issues continue.

35:04.401 --> 35:07.537
The bottom line is, if
you want to move forward,

35:07.571 --> 35:10.440
understanding all the risks,

35:10.474 --> 35:12.375
I will support you

35:12.409 --> 35:15.545
and do what I can to get
your parents on board too.

35:15.579 --> 35:17.714
- Really?
- Really.

35:17.748 --> 35:19.882
Can a girl give you a hug?

35:19.917 --> 35:22.218
This girl can.

35:24.221 --> 35:26.556
Thank you.

35:32.283 --> 35:33.950
Well, that's good.

35:33.985 --> 35:36.586
How much did we rake in if
you include promised gifts?

35:36.621 --> 35:37.854
Are you kidding? [phone ringing]

35:37.889 --> 35:38.889
Oh, my God.

35:38.923 --> 35:41.425
We surpassed our goal by 50%.

35:41.459 --> 35:43.160
Hello?

35:43.194 --> 35:44.961
Yeah. Thank... thank you so much.

35:44.996 --> 35:46.163
That's great. All right.

35:46.197 --> 35:47.998
Bye-bye.

35:48.032 --> 35:50.133
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

35:50.168 --> 35:53.870
We felt exactly the same.

35:53.905 --> 35:55.405
Yes. We agree.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.441
We agree. Absolutely.

35:57.475 --> 35:58.442
Of course, of course.

35:58.476 --> 36:00.077
Thank you for calling.

36:00.111 --> 36:01.511
Okay. We'll do that.

36:01.546 --> 36:03.680
Tomorrow. All right.

36:03.714 --> 36:04.681
What?

36:04.715 --> 36:06.183
She wants us.

36:06.217 --> 36:07.451
- Who?
- Elán.

36:07.485 --> 36:10.353
She wants us.

36:10.388 --> 36:11.521
To have her baby?

36:11.556 --> 36:14.858
We're gonna be parents.

36:14.892 --> 36:16.560
Is that okay?

36:16.594 --> 36:18.028
It's perfect.

36:18.062 --> 36:20.063
It could not be more perfect.

36:20.098 --> 36:22.866
We're gonna have a baby.

36:22.900 --> 36:26.603
[laughs]

36:26.637 --> 36:29.106
I'm gonna be a pops.

36:30.942 --> 36:31.975
Wow.

36:34.846 --> 36:37.547
♪ Strumming on the old banjo ♪

36:37.582 --> 36:40.050
♪ Say, Dinah, won't you blow ♪

36:40.084 --> 36:43.053
♪ Dinah, won't you blow... ♪

36:43.087 --> 36:44.688
[sighs]

36:52.697 --> 36:54.931
(Divya) You're back. [laughs]

36:54.966 --> 36:58.235
And you're a genius.

36:58.269 --> 36:59.970
I am.

37:00.004 --> 37:01.872
I paid Nate double to set this thing up

37:01.906 --> 37:03.807
and then sent our HandyManny home early.

37:03.841 --> 37:07.444
Oh, look at you.

37:07.478 --> 37:09.479
[kisses]

37:09.514 --> 37:11.148
Oh, are the twins here?

37:11.182 --> 37:13.116
Dropped them at Karen's.

37:13.151 --> 37:14.284
How was the gala?

37:14.318 --> 37:17.621
It was great financially.

37:17.655 --> 37:20.056
- Those are the best kind.
- Yes, yes.

37:20.091 --> 37:22.325
I mean, really big donors.

37:22.360 --> 37:27.030
But none of them brought these.

37:27.064 --> 37:28.265
Oh, no. Not...

37:28.299 --> 37:29.866
What else? Butterscotch pecan.

37:29.901 --> 37:32.903
[sighs] My weakness.

37:32.937 --> 37:36.973
But I ate way too much tonight,
and I'm totally exhausted.

37:37.008 --> 37:39.876
Plus, I have an early start tomorrow.

37:39.911 --> 37:42.512
Mm, Mondays are rough,

37:42.547 --> 37:46.783
but these could take the edge off.

37:46.817 --> 37:49.653
Could we save them for tomorrow?

37:49.687 --> 37:51.521
Only if I take them with me.

37:51.556 --> 37:54.824
[laughs]

37:54.859 --> 37:57.093
I do know you.

37:57.128 --> 37:59.629
You do.

37:59.664 --> 38:01.665
Bye, my little girl. [kisses]

38:11.742 --> 38:15.245
[knocking]

38:15.279 --> 38:18.281
Hank?

38:18.316 --> 38:20.417
Am I early?

38:20.451 --> 38:21.751
Did you...

38:21.786 --> 38:23.987
oh, you actually thought you had...

38:24.021 --> 38:27.324
Well, I texted, and you said, "Perfect."

38:27.358 --> 38:29.826
Oh, that was you? [clicks tongue]

38:29.860 --> 38:31.595
I didn't recognize the number.

38:31.629 --> 38:34.197
No wonder my masseuse was so confused

38:34.232 --> 38:35.565
when I called to cancel.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.601
Wait. So you weren't expecting...

38:37.635 --> 38:41.538
I mean, this whole date thing
was more... I don't know.

38:41.572 --> 38:44.274
- Conceptual.
- An excuse to write a check.

38:44.308 --> 38:45.909
Check always does it.

38:45.943 --> 38:47.777
And now I know.

38:47.812 --> 38:49.879
Sorry to interrupt your workout,

38:49.914 --> 38:51.748
and if you could just keep it mum

38:51.782 --> 38:53.783
that the Hamptons' most eligible bachelor

38:53.818 --> 38:55.952
is totally clueless, I would appreciate it.

38:55.987 --> 38:58.355
Yeah, if this actually got out,
it could lower your price.

38:58.389 --> 38:59.589
Yeah.

38:59.624 --> 39:01.024
Well, it was nice to meet you, Olympia.

39:01.058 --> 39:04.427
Thanks again for your donation,
and have a great evening.

39:04.462 --> 39:05.895
I did have a great evening.

39:05.930 --> 39:06.997
Thank you, Hank.

39:07.031 --> 39:08.398
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

39:08.432 --> 39:09.799
Yeah, me too.

39:09.834 --> 39:13.303
This was the best date I've
had all month, actually.

39:13.337 --> 39:15.205
Well, I should go.

39:15.239 --> 39:17.774
Well, you're already here.

39:17.808 --> 39:20.610
Why don't you come in?

39:23.614 --> 39:25.615
Yeah, okay.

39:32.857 --> 39:34.190
What do you mean there's nothing you can do?

39:34.225 --> 39:36.493
You're the bank. Yes.

39:36.527 --> 39:38.895
Of course I've tried to contact
Mr. McGuire on his phone,

39:38.929 --> 39:41.064
but it's inactive.

39:43.067 --> 39:45.669
There must be something you...

39:45.703 --> 39:50.573
what about the 72-hour hold?

39:50.608 --> 39:54.511
It's a 24-hour hold?

39:54.545 --> 39:56.546
So the funds would...

39:58.549 --> 40:00.183
Mm-hmm.

40:00.217 --> 40:02.552
I see.

40:04.555 --> 40:06.189
Okay. Thanks.

40:26.143 --> 40:28.478
[voice breaking] Divya,
if you get this, will you...

40:39.056 --> 40:41.224
Okay.

40:42.860 --> 40:44.861
Okay.
