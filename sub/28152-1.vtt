WEBVTT

01:02.245 --> 01:03.325
Robbie?

01:35.045 --> 01:36.245
Have you done your homework?

01:46.165 --> 01:49.165
<i>Climate change activists</i>
<i>face the prospect of…</i>

02:33.045 --> 02:34.125
I can't breathe.

02:36.005 --> 02:36.965
I need to get out!

02:39.405 --> 02:40.445
Let me out!

02:45.365 --> 02:47.045
Let me out!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.765
I need out!

02:49.925 --> 02:51.245
Let me out!

03:04.485 --> 03:06.445
-Everything all right back here?

04:50.965 --> 04:52.405
Goodbye, Canberra.

04:53.245 --> 04:57.165
<i>Auf wiedersehen, adieu </i>and fuck you.

04:57.245 --> 04:59.285
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

05:01.005 --> 05:02.605
You knew that right, Min?

05:04.365 --> 05:05.685
Didn't think you meant it.

05:09.765 --> 05:12.765
I mean, there's just nothing here
for me anymore. I...

05:13.605 --> 05:15.365
Who's going to hire an ex-con?

05:20.325 --> 05:21.885
Maybe we should dive in, Harri.

05:24.085 --> 05:27.485
-I thought you said you can't swim.
-I can't.

05:30.485 --> 05:32.565
-Hey, Min.
-Yeah.

05:32.885 --> 05:34.085
Let's get you home.

05:35.805 --> 05:38.365
What's the point? I can't sleep anyway.

05:39.925 --> 05:42.405
That's probably just 'cause
you miss the top bunk.

05:42.485 --> 05:45.205
-Oh, yeah.
-And the concrete walls.

06:03.685 --> 06:07.525
-Shh.

06:08.405 --> 06:10.605
Baby, I'll get it.

06:12.245 --> 06:14.925
Hey. Mum. Is everything okay?

06:15.005 --> 06:18.565
- <i>Have you heard the news?</i>
-No. What news?

06:18.645 --> 06:21.485
<i>There's been an explosion</i>
<i>here in Davoren Park.</i>

06:21.565 --> 06:24.845
-<i>Karen, it's Pete Lambert's place.</i>
-What?

06:24.925 --> 06:26.325
<i>The whole house went up.</i>

06:26.965 --> 06:29.605
-<i>I've tried calling the neighbors.</i>
-Oh, God.

06:29.685 --> 06:32.245
<i>-I've left five messages.</i>

06:32.325 --> 06:33.565
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

06:34.285 --> 06:35.965
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

06:37.965 --> 06:38.805
<i>Karen?</i>

07:31.445 --> 07:34.725
<i>Indications at this stage</i>
<i>point to a gas-leak explosion.</i>

07:34.805 --> 07:38.645
<i>Locals say the pipeline in the area</i>
<i>has been faulty for some time</i>

07:38.725 --> 07:41.645
<i>and their pleas for help</i>
<i>have fallen on deaf ears.</i>

07:41.725 --> 07:45.165
Tell Lavelle to wait
until after the security briefings.

07:45.245 --> 07:46.965
-He's just traveling now.
-Tony?

07:47.805 --> 07:50.045
-Do I need to know what this is about?
-No.

07:51.485 --> 07:55.285
-I'll have him wait in your office.
-No, Griff. Not my office.

07:55.765 --> 07:56.605
Right.

08:05.325 --> 08:07.165
Sorry I'm late, Prime Minister.

08:07.605 --> 08:10.925
Catriona. Four people are dead.
What the hell happened?

08:12.565 --> 08:14.525
We're still waiting on the site report.

08:14.605 --> 08:16.965
The locals were saying
it was a gas explosion.

08:17.045 --> 08:19.285
History of gas leaks in the street,
apparently.

08:19.365 --> 08:24.965
The last AEMO report recommended
Davoren Park for urgent mains renewal.

08:25.045 --> 08:29.325
But, typically, the Premier has cried poor
and demanded we pay for it.

08:29.405 --> 08:32.045
-Treasury said no.
-Why'd it have to be Wakefield?

08:32.125 --> 08:35.725
Now we'll never shut KK up. Let's move on
to the situation in Pakistan.

08:35.805 --> 08:39.725
-Who's KK?
-The white knight. Karen Koutoufides.

08:40.405 --> 08:41.845
The third K is silent.

08:49.005 --> 08:51.205
You following this?
I'm getting flayed alive.

08:51.285 --> 08:53.325
The house is in session.
What are you supposed to do?

08:55.285 --> 08:59.685
Yeah, well, it's my electorate.
People expect me on the ground in crisis.

08:59.765 --> 09:02.845
You have been riding the government
about these gas leaks since the campaign.

09:05.285 --> 09:07.285
Uh, maybe we should go the back way.

09:08.405 --> 09:10.205
Shoot. No, it's too late.

09:11.085 --> 09:12.405
Here. Get this on ice.

09:19.485 --> 09:22.285
-Oh, KK, do you want the victim's names?

09:22.365 --> 09:24.405
I know the victims' names, Dec.

09:28.165 --> 09:30.725
- Karen!

09:32.725 --> 09:34.405
Today is a dark day.

09:35.085 --> 09:38.085
What happened in Davoren Park
is a human tragedy

09:38.165 --> 09:41.605
and now a 16-year-old boy,
Robbie Lambert, is an orphan.

09:42.485 --> 09:44.365
I personally know the Lambert family.

09:45.245 --> 09:48.725
Their youngest, Oscar,
went to the same school as my son.

09:50.565 --> 09:52.445
We all grew up in the same community.

09:52.845 --> 09:56.445
Hard-working families that have been
abandoned by this government...

09:57.045 --> 10:02.125
many who are losing their jobs,
their homes and now their lives.

10:05.485 --> 10:09.365
Oh.  When is this prime minister
going to stand up for them?

10:10.485 --> 10:13.285
Those are the questions
that I will continue to ask. Thank you.

10:16.485 --> 10:21.565
It was an ambush. The safe house
was just inside the Pakistani border.

10:25.405 --> 10:27.205
Is that Pashtun or Urdu?

10:27.285 --> 10:29.965
-Afghan Pashtun, Minister.
-So it's Haqqani.

10:30.045 --> 10:33.525
<i>We've lost Markson!</i>
<i>Shit! Fall back! Fall back!</i>

10:36.965 --> 10:40.005
<i>-Where's Markson? Where's Markson?</i>
- <i>I don't see him, sir!</i>

10:40.085 --> 10:41.845
Corporal Markson was captured.

10:47.165 --> 10:50.445
<i>Clemens is hit! Clemens is hit!</i>
<i>Fall back! Fall back!</i>

10:57.605 --> 10:59.365
Jim, where's Redback One now?

10:59.445 --> 11:02.405
They're in the air now.
They left Bagram Airfield overnight.

11:02.485 --> 11:04.205
They should be touching down in an hour.

11:04.285 --> 11:06.445
-Wes, you'll be there?
-Yes, Prime Minister.

11:06.725 --> 11:07.845
I don't envy you that.

11:07.925 --> 11:09.285
I want a briefing after they land.

11:09.725 --> 11:12.325
Have the Pakistani ambassador standing by.
Thank you.

11:20.845 --> 11:22.125
Shall I join you?

11:23.045 --> 11:24.405
Griff, leave us.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.805
This will be a short meeting, Mr. Lavelle.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.565
I know what you people are up to.

11:42.565 --> 11:44.005
It ends now.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.605
I'm afraid that's impossible, Minister.

11:49.245 --> 11:52.405
You don't get to decide that, Mr. Lavelle.
I do.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.885
Now, shut it down or I tell the PM.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.245
Is there anything I can do?

12:11.405 --> 12:12.245
No.

12:35.765 --> 12:40.165
<i>Toys now adorn this iconic</i>
<i>fencing, erected by authorities to...</i>

12:40.925 --> 12:42.765
-How's the hangover?
-It's fine.

12:44.205 --> 12:45.805
-Can I make you some breakfast?
-No.

12:47.765 --> 12:49.405
-You off to the police station?
-Yeah.

12:54.805 --> 12:56.005
Nice talk, Harriet.

12:56.085 --> 12:58.005
<i>...the names of the four victims,</i>

12:58.085 --> 13:03.085
<i>Peter Lambert. Suzie Lambert,</i>
<i>Chloe Lambert and Oscar Lambert.</i>

13:03.165 --> 13:06.405
<i>A memorial service will be held</i>
<i>in the coming days.</i>

13:18.405 --> 13:20.405
-Don't say it.
-Fucking politicians, sir.

13:20.485 --> 13:22.085
-I'm working on it.
-We go in as a patrol.

13:22.165 --> 13:24.085
We come out as a patrol.
No man left behind.

13:24.165 --> 13:26.885
-I'm handling it, Sullivan.
-How's Markson handling it?

13:27.765 --> 13:29.965
These people haven't even heard
of the Geneva Convention.

13:30.965 --> 13:34.125
How'd they find out about the safe house?
They didn't just get lucky.

13:36.885 --> 13:40.005
I'm pulling you out of the debrief,
Lieutenant. I need you to go to Adelaide.

13:40.725 --> 13:41.765
No uniform.

13:41.845 --> 13:42.845
Adelaide?

13:44.205 --> 13:45.285
She's gone AWOL.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.845
- Get off me!
- You're making it worse.

15:15.285 --> 15:16.125
Hey.

15:16.205 --> 15:17.125
Calm down.

15:18.885 --> 15:19.765
Oh, fuck.

15:20.805 --> 15:22.045
Harriet Dunkley.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.165
Wow, fancy meeting you here.

15:24.245 --> 15:27.685
Oh, you got my last day of parole
marked on your calendar, do you?

15:28.045 --> 15:31.205
It's a story, Harriet.
You of all people would understand that.

15:32.445 --> 15:35.725
I'm curious, what does an ex-con
like you do now that you're free?

15:35.805 --> 15:38.965
-I'm going to get the hell out of here.
-I don't buy it.

15:39.045 --> 15:42.085
You're a political animal.
Canberra's your natural habitat.

15:42.165 --> 15:44.165
There's nothing natural about it, Ludie.

15:44.245 --> 15:47.605
-It's a fucking zoo and you know it.
-Yeah. Sure.

15:48.805 --> 15:51.685
I'm offering you a chance
to poke a stick at the wildlife.

15:52.205 --> 15:54.245
Regular panel gig, my show.

15:54.805 --> 15:57.405
Tell your side of the story.
Set the record straight.

15:59.565 --> 16:03.365
You skewer that arsehole, Bailey,
and you dance on Paxton's grave,

16:03.445 --> 16:04.805
the whole bloody lot of them.

16:06.485 --> 16:09.685
It's a well-paid gig. It's worth a lot
of money. You get your foot in the door.

16:11.085 --> 16:14.645
I would just be live bait for your conga
line of demagogues and you know it.

16:14.965 --> 16:15.885
Okay.

16:18.485 --> 16:20.005
Can't blame a girl for trying.

16:21.805 --> 16:24.405
You know we'll do a hatchet job
on you either way?

16:27.845 --> 16:28.685
Harriet?

16:45.925 --> 16:48.045
Mum, stop.

16:54.445 --> 16:56.645
-Five more minutes.
-Okay.

17:58.685 --> 17:59.565
That's it?

18:00.685 --> 18:01.725
All done.

18:03.245 --> 18:04.085
Good luck.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.285
Hey, Mina.

18:46.005 --> 18:48.085
-What happened?
-She's inside.

19:07.565 --> 19:10.485
-I don’t like her in my house
-She is helping me, Sami.

19:11.045 --> 19:12.125
She’s helping?

19:23.325 --> 19:25.365
Min, this is classified. Who sent it?

19:25.445 --> 19:28.005
Anonymous. Called themselves the Rabbit.
-I didn't know Bailey was Defense.
-She's been in three governments

19:32.445 --> 19:34.205
and both houses of parliament
for 30 years.

19:34.285 --> 19:36.885
She's like a cockroach.
She'd survive the apocalypse.

19:36.965 --> 19:39.085
-Are these bits blocked out?
-Yeah, they're redacted.

19:39.765 --> 19:41.005
Can we find out?

19:41.085 --> 19:44.685
Well, freedom of information allows
exceptions for Defense

19:44.765 --> 19:46.445
and National Security.

19:48.005 --> 19:50.645
See what they called them? EKIA.

19:51.205 --> 19:52.565
Enemy Killed In Action.

19:54.085 --> 19:57.645
My father, my mother,
my husband, my little boy.

19:59.165 --> 20:02.765
The location, the date, it's them,
Harri... and Bailey buried it.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.805
-I should've been there.
-You were getting medicine for your boy.

20:12.965 --> 20:14.165
I need to see Bailey.

20:15.565 --> 20:17.285
-That's not a good idea.
-You know her.

20:17.365 --> 20:19.325
-You can get me to her.
-I have no accreditation.

20:19.405 --> 20:21.325
-I'm <i>persona non grata</i>.
-I need this.

20:25.765 --> 20:28.125
You got a little girl
and this whole new life.

20:31.085 --> 20:32.645
Get me in a room with Bailey, Harri.

20:34.285 --> 20:35.365
You owe me that.

20:40.805 --> 20:42.445
Excuse me, Ambassador.

20:55.685 --> 20:58.325
Lavatory attendant now, Harriet?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.485
You're moving up in the world.

21:00.565 --> 21:03.685
I thought you'd be prime minister
by the time I got out, Catriona.

21:04.365 --> 21:06.405
Why would I accept a demotion?

21:06.885 --> 21:09.765
Come on. Everybody knows you quit
the Senate to parachute

21:09.845 --> 21:13.685
into the House of Reps for the
leadership spill and snare the top job.

21:13.765 --> 21:17.885
Guess I'll just have to settle
for sweeping powers and a super-ministry.

21:19.285 --> 21:22.885
I got a favor to ask you and I figure
it's the least you can do for me.

21:22.965 --> 21:27.205
Harriet, I'm already doing
the least I can do for you.

21:28.725 --> 21:29.565
All right.

21:30.085 --> 21:33.245
Well, a skeleton's
fallen out of your closet.

21:34.445 --> 21:36.205
2003, Iraq.

21:37.165 --> 21:41.125
You shut down the ADF inquiry.
Special Forces planted drop weapons

21:41.205 --> 21:43.965
on an innocent family
to make them look like insurgents.

21:44.205 --> 21:47.325
There's a surviving member,
mother of a four-year-old boy...

21:47.965 --> 21:49.565
and she'd like to meet with you.

21:52.085 --> 21:57.165
I will not be threatened by a traitor
to her country or her criminal friend.

21:57.245 --> 22:00.765
Traitor? I mean, that's the pot
calling the kettle Chinese, isn't it?

22:01.565 --> 22:03.125
Save your breath, Harriet.

22:03.525 --> 22:06.925
You're the little girl who cried wolf.
Nobody's listening.

22:07.645 --> 22:10.965
Excuse me.
Can't keep the US Ambassador waiting.

22:21.245 --> 22:22.165
Harriet.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.565
-Griff.
-Today's the big day, huh?

22:25.485 --> 22:27.285
Paid your debt to society, and all that?

22:27.365 --> 22:30.805
-Yeah, I mean, something like that.
-Yeah. Well, you look good.

22:31.085 --> 22:33.165
I think prison probably agrees with you.

22:33.885 --> 22:37.245
Better get back to your table, Griff.
You know, drink your Kool-Aid.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.485
-Sullivan.
-<i>Lieutenant, this is Catriona Bailey.</i>

24:11.565 --> 24:13.405
-<i>Are you at the site?</i>
-Yes, Minister.

24:14.045 --> 24:17.405
<i>I want you to know that I appreciate</i>
<i>how difficult this must be for you,</i>

24:17.485 --> 24:21.085
<i>but it's a matter of national security</i>
<i>that we contain this situation.</i>

24:21.165 --> 24:23.765
-<i>I'm sure you understand.</i>
-Yes, Minister.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.765
So, I, um... I spoke to Bailey.

24:37.445 --> 24:40.365
She... she won't do it.
She refused point blank.

24:41.205 --> 24:45.045
-Did you tell her it was about Ar-Rutbah?
-Yeah, but she still won't do it.

24:45.845 --> 24:47.005
She owes you.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.485
Catriona Bailey
doesn't really work that way.

24:49.565 --> 24:52.725
I know how Bailey works, Harri.
She covers up lies.

24:54.725 --> 24:56.485
And this one,
she's going to fucking regret.

24:57.325 --> 24:59.685
-You don't know who you're dealing with.
-Neither does she.

25:01.765 --> 25:03.205
It won't bring them back.

25:04.085 --> 25:07.845
I need this, Harri. Akram needs this.

25:14.245 --> 25:15.805
Don't do anything stupid, Mina.

25:27.605 --> 25:29.405
<i>Hi, Ludie Sypek speaking.</i>

25:29.485 --> 25:33.325
Hi, it's, uh... it's Harriet Dunkley.
Listen, I'll do it.

25:33.965 --> 25:34.845
<i>Thought so.</i>

25:35.285 --> 25:37.125
-Yeah. On one condition.
<i>-Mm-hm.</i>

25:38.805 --> 25:40.765
<i>It's like a ghost town there now.</i>

25:41.845 --> 25:46.005
<i>They bussed everyone out after</i>
<i>to make sure it's safe before we go back.</i>

25:46.085 --> 25:48.165
<i>We didn't even get</i>
<i>a change of clothes.</i>

25:48.445 --> 25:51.325
<i>They told us they'd cut off</i>
<i>the gas supply to the street.</i>

25:52.205 --> 25:53.605
<i>Too little, too late.</i>

27:46.045 --> 27:48.405
<i>-Lockwood.</i>
-I think she was here.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.125
<i>Minister?</i>

27:55.205 --> 27:57.205
-Hi.
- <i>Where's Conway?</i>

27:57.485 --> 28:00.285
-I've just been told he's been bumped.
-For who?

28:00.365 --> 28:01.885
-Here we go. In ten.
-I don't know.

28:01.965 --> 28:06.605
-<i>Ask Ludie what the fuck's going on.</i>
-Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

28:06.685 --> 28:09.245
-She's just about to go to air.
-...four, three...

28:10.045 --> 28:12.405
Oh, shit. It's Harriet Dunkley.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.005
<i>You deal with China</i>
<i>and the MSS all the time.</i>

28:23.085 --> 28:25.925
<i>We're talking about trained</i>
<i>ADO operatives, experts in their field.</i>

28:26.005 --> 28:27.165
<i>I stand by the story.</i>

28:27.805 --> 28:31.245
<i>You knowingly breached the Safer</i>
<i>Australia Act because you thought</i>

28:31.325 --> 28:32.565
<i>you were above the law.</i>

28:32.645 --> 28:34.645
<i>I think the law was beneath all of us.</i>

28:34.725 --> 28:38.565
<i>-It's a breach of civil liberties.</i>
- <i>Your bosses don’t seem to think so.</i>

28:38.645 --> 28:40.685
<i>-Their hands were tied.</i>
<i>-They threw you under the bus.</i>

28:40.765 --> 28:42.565
So you've got one bottle left.

28:44.445 --> 28:45.525
I'll see you soon.

28:47.165 --> 28:50.005
<i>Our federal agencies are keeping us</i>
<i>safe in our beds at night.</i>

28:50.445 --> 28:53.405
<i>I'd like to throw to Catriona Bailey</i>
<i>in our Sydney studios.</i>

28:53.725 --> 28:58.565
Minister, do you believe that Harriet
Dunkley has now paid her debt to society?

28:58.885 --> 29:02.925
Ludie, rehabilitation is a key tenet
of our judicial system

29:03.005 --> 29:05.005
and I've always upheld the rule of law.

29:05.445 --> 29:09.045
<i>We should expect nothing less</i>
<i>from our senior ministers of the Crown,</i>

29:09.125 --> 29:12.685
<i>be they responsible for security laws,</i>
<i>privacy laws...</i>

29:12.765 --> 29:17.805
criminal law, military-justice law,
in regard to war crimes, for instance.

29:18.885 --> 29:22.325
<i>Who is watching our government's actions</i>
<i>in Iraq and Afghanistan?</i>

29:27.405 --> 29:31.205
What do you think you're doing? Quite
seriously, what do you think you're doing?

29:31.685 --> 29:35.245
If you pull another blind-siding stunt,
you can kiss the Minister

29:35.325 --> 29:38.485
and every member of her government goodbye
as guests on your show.

29:38.565 --> 29:41.325
Griff, all I can hear
is Bailey's attack poodle yapping.

29:43.045 --> 29:44.525
-There you go.
-Thank you.

29:44.605 --> 29:46.645
Harriet, the Minister will see
your little friend.

30:10.485 --> 30:12.885
-Hello. My name's Andrew Griffiths.

30:12.965 --> 30:16.085
I'm the chief of staff
for the Minister of Home Affairs.

30:16.165 --> 30:18.725
-Thank you for coming in today.
-Where's Catriona Bailey?

30:18.805 --> 30:22.765
-I'm afraid she won't be joining us.
-I was told I'd get to meet Bailey.

30:22.845 --> 30:26.485
You don't just get to meet the Minister.
We know who you are and what you've done.

30:27.525 --> 30:28.605
What <i>I've </i>done?

30:29.805 --> 30:35.365
We brought you out here under
the refugee program in 2005, via Lebanon.

30:35.445 --> 30:40.285
We provided you with an apartment
and furniture and a second-hand computer

30:40.365 --> 30:43.965
for your TAFE course in bookkeeping
and what did you do with that?

30:44.405 --> 30:46.165
Three years for financial fraud.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.285
After we had paid for five years
of trauma counseling.

30:49.365 --> 30:51.605
That's blood money, all of it.

30:52.765 --> 30:53.765
You know what you did.

30:54.405 --> 30:58.205
Well, it's a free country. You're welcome
to go public with your grievance.

30:58.285 --> 31:00.725
You should consider the possibility
of breach of parole

31:00.805 --> 31:04.085
and your husband's suspiciously
successful roof-tiling business

31:04.165 --> 31:05.805
being audited by the ATO.

31:06.685 --> 31:10.725
Who looks after Aliah
with both her parents in jail?

31:16.605 --> 31:19.565
Well, thank you very much
for coming in today.

31:21.085 --> 31:22.005
Ms. Almasi.

31:45.365 --> 31:47.405
That old rag's gone to the dogs,
if you ask me.

31:49.045 --> 31:50.485
Karen Koutoufides?

31:52.965 --> 31:54.205
Mum's taking a keen interest.

31:56.205 --> 32:00.125
She's on her second attempt at parenting
me, which isn't her natural skill set.

32:00.205 --> 32:02.125
I happen to believe in second chances.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.205
I'm looking for a senior media advisor.

32:07.045 --> 32:10.245
I'm a little bit out of the loop,
but I could recommend someone.

32:10.325 --> 32:11.325
I'm asking you.

32:13.045 --> 32:17.165
I've checked the regulations. It seems
I can hire staff with a criminal record.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.485
Full salary, with benefits.

32:21.845 --> 32:22.885
What do you say?

32:26.205 --> 32:27.925
Um...

32:29.165 --> 32:31.285
Thanks, but no thanks.

32:33.325 --> 32:34.165
Hm.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.245
You're cool.

32:38.845 --> 32:41.005
Mum's not the only one
keeping a close eye.

33:03.205 --> 33:04.045
Director.

33:05.605 --> 33:06.565
Someone here to see you.

33:08.485 --> 33:09.565
Thanks, Thomas.

33:25.765 --> 33:29.805
You can call off your little shadow squad,
Vaughn, I'm leaving. Is this Bailey?

33:29.885 --> 33:31.325
Did she ask you to watch me?

33:32.045 --> 33:35.325
-Who says we're watching you?
-Did you send an email to my ex-cell mate?

33:36.645 --> 33:37.605
You the Rabbit?

33:37.685 --> 33:39.245
The Rabbit?

33:39.805 --> 33:41.485
What did they do to you in there, Harriet?

33:41.565 --> 33:44.645
Electro-shock treatment?
You should've gone on that plane.

33:45.325 --> 33:48.205
Could have been on a beach somewhere
instead of rotting in a concrete cell.

33:48.285 --> 33:51.485
I would've got tracked.
Interpol or your lot.

33:51.565 --> 33:53.285
Mm. You weren't that important.

33:53.845 --> 33:55.725
Neither was Kim, apparently.

33:56.685 --> 33:59.085
I mean, murdered at the hands
of an ASIO operative

33:59.165 --> 34:01.605
and there's no Royal Commission,
no inquiry?

34:04.605 --> 34:08.165
You'd be well-advised to keep
your distance from Mina and Sami Almasi.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.605
-Boss.
-What is it, Thomas?

34:23.045 --> 34:24.885
Robbie Lambert's digital footprint.

35:06.645 --> 35:07.685
How you going?

35:09.485 --> 35:10.325
Robbie?

35:11.645 --> 35:16.525
Hi, I'm Karen Koutoufides. My son, Arlo,
went to school with your little brother.

35:19.125 --> 35:22.485
I'm... so very sorry for your loss.

35:22.885 --> 35:26.885
Robbie, I work in Canberra.
I represent the people of Davoren Park

35:26.965 --> 35:29.365
and I want you to know
that I am going to fight.

35:29.445 --> 35:30.405
For what?

35:32.685 --> 35:34.245
You can't bring back my family.

35:47.525 --> 35:51.805
I understand that you've got an uncle
in the UK. We could look at an airfare.

35:52.085 --> 35:53.405
Mum and him weren't close.

35:54.605 --> 35:57.645
-The Houlis said I could stay with them.
-Okay.

35:59.085 --> 35:59.925
Okay.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.485
This is my direct number.

36:03.405 --> 36:05.325
Okay, now, you can call me any time.

36:06.485 --> 36:07.325
Okay?

36:16.085 --> 36:17.005
Excuse me, what...

36:17.085 --> 36:18.925
- Robbie?
-Where are you taking him?

36:19.005 --> 36:20.965
- Robbie?
- What's going on?

36:21.045 --> 36:22.765
- Who are you?
- What's going on?

36:22.845 --> 36:24.085
Robbie!

36:24.165 --> 36:25.845
Are you filming this?

36:25.925 --> 36:28.165
Robbie! Robbie!

36:28.245 --> 36:29.805
-Where are you taking him?

36:29.885 --> 36:33.045
Excuse me. We've got a right to know.
We'll find out what's going on.

36:33.925 --> 36:34.885
Robbie?

36:37.045 --> 36:38.285
-It's okay.

36:43.685 --> 36:45.725
Yes, I've read the brief,

36:45.805 --> 36:48.005
and I've read the ASD report...

36:48.885 --> 36:50.885
and I'm aware he's 16 years old.

36:50.965 --> 36:54.005
What I'm asking is,
are you ready to charge him?

36:55.645 --> 37:00.165
I know they think we shot Bambi,
but wait till they see the facts, hm?

37:03.005 --> 37:04.125
Minister.

37:04.605 --> 37:05.445
Good morning.

37:05.525 --> 37:09.405
This is amazing. My...
My daughter is your biggest fan.

37:09.925 --> 37:13.045
-Oh! What's your name?
-Aliah.

37:13.845 --> 37:16.685
She's gone all shy.
Can she get a photo with you?

37:16.765 --> 37:17.885
-Of course.
-Go on.

37:20.765 --> 37:21.605
Smile.

37:23.925 --> 37:25.525
Aw, beautiful.

37:25.605 --> 37:26.925
Can I get one, too?

37:27.005 --> 37:28.165
Oh, sure.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.325
They killed my family
and you covered it up.
I know what you are.
Harriet Dunkley told me.

37:48.565 --> 37:50.245
-Who was that, Mama?

37:50.325 --> 37:51.805
Nobody important, sweetheart.

37:55.365 --> 37:57.605
<i>Robbie Lambert was arrested after...</i>

37:57.685 --> 38:00.845
<i>...drastic action</i>
<i>if this kid wasn't up to his neck in it.</i>

38:00.925 --> 38:03.485
<i>Independent MP</i>
<i>Karen Koutoufides on hand...</i>

38:03.565 --> 38:05.685
<i>What isn't she telling us?</i>

38:07.845 --> 38:12.685
Bailey's office isn't returning any of our
calls about Robbie Lambert. No one is.

38:15.485 --> 38:17.845
-What do you want me to do?

38:18.765 --> 38:19.765
Shut the door.

38:39.405 --> 38:43.365
We suspect the boy was storing
some kind of homemade IED

38:43.445 --> 38:46.245
for a militant leftist group
in the family garage.

38:47.205 --> 38:49.085
We're still to ascertain
the cause of detonation.

38:49.285 --> 38:52.725
Sorry to interrupt, Director General.
Minister, you really should see this.

38:53.285 --> 38:55.245
Oh, excuse me, Madeline.

38:59.285 --> 39:02.845
Clearly, she didn't get
the message. I had it translated.

39:03.485 --> 39:05.885
Good, 'cause I don't speak Chinese.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.285
It says, "Do I have your attention now?"

39:09.805 --> 39:11.245
Shall I alert the AFP?

39:12.845 --> 39:14.965
No, not yet.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.525
Harriet, come here.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.725
What's the meaning of this?

39:57.925 --> 40:00.925
I mean, you got to understand.
Mina... Mina lost everything.

40:01.005 --> 40:02.445
She lost her whole family.

40:03.205 --> 40:04.845
There's always more to lose.

40:05.845 --> 40:08.405
I don't respond well to threats, Harriet.

40:08.485 --> 40:10.765
You should know that
from personal experience.
I suggest you call off your dog.

40:14.285 --> 40:15.565
Oh, she's not my dog.

40:16.765 --> 40:18.525
What is it between you two?

40:19.245 --> 40:22.325
Gay for the stay,
isn't that what they call it?

40:23.645 --> 40:26.365
I've called a press conference
for tomorrow morning

40:26.445 --> 40:32.925
to announce an IGADF inquiry into
the Special Forces incident in Ar-Rutbah.

40:33.485 --> 40:36.325
All the major outlets have been advised.

40:39.405 --> 40:42.205
That's unlike you, Catriona,
taking a backwards step.

40:42.685 --> 40:47.525
I'm a pragmatist, Harriet.
We tend to outlast the idealists.

41:00.245 --> 41:03.125
<i>"And then the queen looked out</i>
<i>the castle window</i>

41:03.205 --> 41:06.285
<i>and saw the flock of ravens</i>
<i>across the sky..."</i>

41:06.365 --> 41:08.125
-"And she said to her..."

41:08.205 --> 41:10.245
What'd she say to her? Remember?

41:12.605 --> 41:17.245
"What do you want to do to become a
raven?" And then all her dreams came true.

41:17.565 --> 41:19.525
-And she became a raven.
-Mm-hm.

41:47.525 --> 41:48.365
Mama?

41:50.925 --> 41:51.925
What are you doing?

41:52.645 --> 41:55.965
Aliah, go back to bed. I'll be home soon.

41:58.365 --> 41:59.205
I promise.

42:38.925 --> 42:41.565
Howie, the day's not over yet.

42:41.645 --> 42:43.005
I'll need you to come back.

42:43.085 --> 42:45.685
I have to go to Defense.
You won't have to wait.

43:20.325 --> 43:23.045
- So, where you headed?
-Canberra.

43:23.125 --> 43:24.285
I'm headed that way.

44:47.165 --> 44:50.325
<i>Relax you mind,</i>
<i>Jeffrey. Relax your body and...</i>

44:59.645 --> 45:00.725
It's late.

45:02.485 --> 45:04.925
<i>Yeah, well, she's not answering my calls</i>
<i>and it's important.</i>

45:07.765 --> 45:11.405
Listen to me,
I don't want you in my house.

45:11.485 --> 45:12.325
Hm?

45:12.805 --> 45:15.765
I don't want some ex-journalist
prying into my business.

45:18.405 --> 45:22.405
<i>Two years in a two by three meter cell,</i>
<i>Sami, we were always going to talk.</i>

45:27.325 --> 45:28.365
Mina's not here.

45:31.565 --> 45:32.925
I assumed she was meeting you.

45:35.245 --> 45:36.965
<i>Did she say where she was going?</i>

45:38.405 --> 45:39.245
<i>Fuck.</i>

46:37.165 --> 46:39.525
- Harri, it's me. It's me.

46:39.605 --> 46:42.245
It's me. It's me.
It was a trap, the whole thing.

46:42.325 --> 46:43.765
What? Slow down.

46:43.845 --> 46:46.485
You need to get out before
they come for you. They set us both up.

46:46.565 --> 46:48.045
-Who?
-The fucking Rabbit.

46:48.125 --> 46:51.445
-What?
-Bailey's dead... murdered.

46:52.925 --> 46:55.685
You need to get in your car
and get out now.

46:56.805 --> 46:59.005
-Trust me, Harri.
- Jesus Christ!

47:02.005 --> 47:03.325
Mina, where are you going?

47:05.045 --> 47:07.005
I can't let them put me back in a cell.

47:07.085 --> 47:10.405
Okay. Give me your phone.
I'll turn it off so they can't trace you.

47:38.445 --> 47:39.525
Oh, Jesus.

47:43.685 --> 47:44.965
Not going to say goodbye?

47:46.925 --> 47:50.165
-Well, I mean, I didn't want to wake you.
-That's not why.

47:57.565 --> 47:59.285
I never asked you to come here, Mum.

48:00.605 --> 48:01.525
I know.
