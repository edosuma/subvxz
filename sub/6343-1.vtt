<i>The boys leading 3-nil in
the 83rd minute here at Celtic Park.</i>

00:27.728 --> 00:31.870
<i>The phenom George Dryer looking for
his second hat trick of the tournament.</i>

00:32.031 --> 00:35.570

ahead of his marker.</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:40.082
<i>McKinley looking for a shot.
There's Dryer in the box.</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:45.053
<i>Goal. Oh, what a goal from Dryer!
That was magnificent.</i>

00:47.681 --> 00:51.185
<i>Going down the
left wing, crosses to Dryer.</i>

00:51.351 --> 00:53.388
<i>Oh, what a brilliant goal!</i>

00:53.554 --> 00:57.593
<i>Dryer launched himself at the ball
and smashed it into the back of the net.</i>

00:57.758 --> 00:59.999
<i>...with room to run.</i>

01:00.160 --> 01:02.766
<i>Moreno, feeling the pressure,
leaves it for Dryer.</i>

01:02.930 --> 01:06.377
<i>Dryer with a shot from near midfield,
goal! Goal!</i>

01:06.533 --> 01:09.605
<i>George Dryer with an absolute rocket.</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:11.750
<i>King George does it one more time.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:15.182
<i>King George! The glorious...</i>

01:15.342 --> 01:17.382
<i>Dryer is down and it doesn't look good.</i>

01:17.544 --> 01:20.218
<i>A terrible injury for Dryer.</i>

01:20.380 --> 01:23.122
<i>- They've called for a stretcher.
- It's a sad day.</i>

01:23.283 --> 01:25.593
<i>George Dryer
leaves the game at age 36.</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:28.631
<i>Long live King George.</i>

01:30.557 --> 01:34.198
And now for CSA Sports
in Washington, I'm George Dryer.

01:34.361 --> 01:39.572
On a last second penalty kick today,
DC United beat the Colorado Rapids 4-3.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.076
Now with that victory...

01:45.072 --> 01:46.551
Now with that victory,

01:46.707 --> 01:50.917
United has put together
its longest winning streak since 2000.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.519
Oh, hey, Param, I'm just, uh...

02:32.686 --> 02:36.532
Last week you said you were gonna
get me the security deposit.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.604
I did, that's right. By the way,
did your son like the soccer jersey?

02:40.761 --> 02:43.537
Yeah, thank you, but
you know the security deposit...

02:43.697 --> 02:47.304
I'm on my way to the bank right now.
But ifs been two weeks.

02:47.467 --> 02:51.005
Yeah, yeah, don't worry. I'm on it.
Two weeks.

02:51.171 --> 02:56.484
So this is me with the Celtic in 2003,
played against Portugal in the final UF cup.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.385
Liverpool, AC Milan 2005.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.152
It's good stuff when you put it together.
Yeah.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.386
Four medals.
This is the boots I wore

03:04.551 --> 03:07.828
when I scored against England
when I played with Scotland.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.025
Best moment of my life.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.863
Is that you and Beckham?
Yeah.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.837
Quarterfinal of the Champions league.
That was a great game.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.304
That's cool, man.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.842
So, what are you doing
here in Virginia?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.915
I'm just here visiting my boy.
He lives here with his mom.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.552
Yeah, trying to patch
things up, right?

03:27.708 --> 03:28.743
I know, I know.

03:28.909 --> 03:34.018
I gotta kind of get a bit of a move on.
So, what do you think for all this?

03:34.347 --> 03:37.988
Um, I can give you $300 cash
for everything.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.095
$300.
Mm-hm.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.698
You kidding me?
No.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.165
For all of this?
Yeah.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.326
Now, if you had some
LeBron James...

04:02.709 --> 04:03.949
Hey, kiddo.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.092
We've been waiting for a half-hour.
I know, sorry.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.592
Traffic was jammed. A nightmare.
That crazy suburban traffic.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.094
Dad, we're gonna be late.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.858
We'll be fashionably late.
Totally different.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.399
I used to do it all the time.
You still do.

04:17.557 --> 04:21.232
Your mom's a funny lady, you know?
Can I take him for dinner after?

04:21.394 --> 04:23.271
Come on, Mom.
He's got homework.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.740
What if we're back by 7?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.071
We'll be back by 7.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.407
Fine, 7. But that
doesn't mean 8 or 8:15.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.209
No, no, no, 7.
Enjoy practice. You're late.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.147
Say, "Bye, Mom."
Bye, Mom.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.945
Bye, Mom.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.591
So I moved into my new place.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.053
I know.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.322
Oh, yeah, your mom tell you?

04:48.555 --> 04:49.761
Wait till you see it.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.427
You got your own room this time.
You're gonna love it, kiddo.

05:00.567 --> 05:04.777
I'm sorry I haven't been by in a while.
I know it's been a couple of weeks.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.943
It's more than a couple of weeks.
It's been a plethora of weeks.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.454
Oh, a plethora, huh?

05:13.079 --> 05:14.615
It means a lot.

05:14.781 --> 05:18.957
We're gonna have a plethora of good
times today, what do you say, champ?

05:21.354 --> 05:23.857
Hey, how's the team doing?
The team bites.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.005
We lost all our games.
We haven't scored all season.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.606
Really? Wow.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.300
Well, that sucks.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.502
So, what does your coach
say about that?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.443
I don't know.

05:37.337 --> 05:41.649
Well, always remember,
you have to respect your coach, okay?

05:41.808 --> 05:45.119
Okay.
All right. Go. Come on.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.181
Enjoy.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.856
Kick it with your toes.
Remember, we want to score goals.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.665
Go, go find a ball.
Hello, hey, what did they say?

05:54.821 --> 05:59.031
This way, this way, kick the ball.
We're having fun.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.298
Hold on a sec. Kick it like... all right?
With your toes.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.674
It's not like it's real football.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.905
Just kick the ball into the goal.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.378
So your legs are getting
much longer, huh?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.747
You're gonna be taller
than me soon.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.052
You got a girlfriend? No?

06:21.348 --> 06:23.419
Well, I need to fix you up, then.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.088
How's school?

06:26.253 --> 06:27.664
It's fine.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.358
My class was supposed to
go on a field trip.

06:30.523 --> 06:36.064
But Mom's been stressed out lately.
Matt says it's because of the wedding.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.731
The wedding?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.371
Yeah, Matt and Mom.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.912
Matt and Mom
are getting married?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.378
Mm-hm.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.047
Wow.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.783
Hey, guys. How was practice?
It was great. They were really good.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.255
I almost scored a goal.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.227
Almost, really? That's amazing.
Hey, George.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.797
Hey, Matt.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.262
All right, upstairs.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.868
- Hey. Good night, champ.
- Good night, Dad.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.566
Thanks, George.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.965
So, um,

07:11.798 --> 07:12.868
congratulations.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.305
Lewis told me your big news.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.949
I was gonna tell you, but...

07:19.105 --> 07:21.779
No, I mean it's fine.
I mean, it's no big deal...

07:21.942 --> 07:24.752
I mean, obviously
it's a big deal for you.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.289
It's okay, you don't have to
say anything.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.721
I just...

07:29.950 --> 07:32.430
Anyway, okay. It's good.
Well done.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.155
Thank you.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.125
All right, I better be...
I'll see you next week.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.326
Yeah. Good night.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.301
All right. Good night.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.949
<i>Now, with this victory,</i>

07:55.108 --> 07:59.022
<i>United has now put together
its longest winning streak since 2004.</i>

07:59.179 --> 08:02.786
<i>Are you excited? Well, lam,
especially since their next game</i>

08:02.949 --> 08:06.624
<i>is against L.A. Galaxy
at the L.A. Home Depot Center.</i>

08:06.786 --> 08:10.632
<i>Now, Beckham back from injury,
Landon Donovan back from suspension.</i>

08:10.790 --> 08:15.000
<i>This is shaping up to be a good one.
My gran won't be missing this.</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:18.472
<i>This is George Dryer signing out,
CSA Sports in Washington.</i>

08:18.631 --> 08:20.508
<i>Have a great night.</i>

08:34.547 --> 08:36.493
It's the European Cup, 2003.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.892
You, me, Smitty and
those Swedish med students,

08:40.053 --> 08:41.964
who I believe were twins.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.159
First, they weren't Swedish.
Irish.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.669
Secondly, they weren't med students,
they were nursing students.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.000
Finally, they weren't even twins.
What?

08:50.163 --> 08:51.335
No, they were triplets.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.176
I could kick myself for not writing a book,
not that anybody would believe it.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.838
Yeah, that's a good point.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.883
Aw... Hey, ladies and gentlemen.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.818
You all remember George Dryer?
How you doing?

09:05.512 --> 09:07.185
What have you been up to?

09:07.347 --> 09:11.159
You were doing some real estate
deal up in Canada or something?

09:11.317 --> 09:14.059
What do you know about
Canada? Or real estate?

09:14.220 --> 09:19.033
Well, it was vacation homes in Winnipeg.
I was just a spokesman, so...

09:19.192 --> 09:20.865
And you had a sports bar, right?

09:21.027 --> 09:23.906
Yeah, yeah, I had a bar.
You know, the economy.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.670
Right, right.
Didn't work out.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.110
Actually, I've been thinking
now about something you suggested.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.272
Like sports-casting.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.750
I made a demo.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.788
I thought I would...
You know, I'd show it to you first.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.721
No, I'll definitely
take a look at it. Heh.

09:41.881 --> 09:45.226
They're always looking for someone
to replace me around here.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.922
Chip, you're on.
Oh, shit. Uh...

09:48.088 --> 09:52.195
Hey, look, put this on my desk, all right.
It belongs to my man here.

09:52.358 --> 09:56.067
Listen, uh, take care, man.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.299
All right, man.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.637
Good to see you.
Always good to see you.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.608
Stick around if you want.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.645
Hey, man. How's it going?
I'm good, I'm good.

10:05.805 --> 10:06.943
George Dryer, huh?

10:07.107 --> 10:11.249
Yeah, back in the day that man
got more ass than a toilet seat.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.152
Hang on, here we go.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.255
All right, soccer fans,
big game going on today.

10:18.418 --> 10:23.094
Joining us with a look at the matchups
in that clash is of course Chip Johnson.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.291
Chip, what do you have?

10:24.457 --> 10:28.928
When our beloved DC United faces off
with the Revolution this afternoon,

10:29.095 --> 10:31.268
it's all gonna come down
to defense.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.503
Unfortunately for us, Jerry, the
black and red have that in spades...

10:52.685 --> 10:55.097
Coach, should we keep going?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.701
That's good. Just keep
doing what you're doing.

10:57.857 --> 11:01.430
Put your foot into it.
Kick it with your toes.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.167
Just straight on.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.139
Like I told you
a hundred times.

11:08.034 --> 11:11.504
Hey, kiddo, give me the ball.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.150
Just use your toes.

11:15.308 --> 11:19.279
Okay, anybody want to know
how to shoot?

11:19.445 --> 11:21.721
- Dad, what are you doing?
- No, it's fine.

11:21.881 --> 11:25.192
All right, any of you want to
score some goals this season?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.796
Yeah.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.728
Okay, go in the goal, okay?

11:28.888 --> 11:32.802
So first of all you need to know
that you don't kick with your toe.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.667
You plant your foot here
and you follow through.

11:35.828 --> 11:36.966
On the laces, okay?

11:37.130 --> 11:40.134
You gotta plant your left foot down
and follow through.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.540
Whoa!

11:41.701 --> 11:43.062
Who wants to learn how to do that?

11:43.136 --> 11:46.515
- Me!
- All right, come on, let's go.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.745
Give him some encouragement.
Oh...

11:50.910 --> 11:55.518
Left foot next to the ball, right
foot follows through. Come on.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.562
Thattaboy, terrific.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.722
We're learning how to shoot.
We're learning how to score.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.232
Okay, here we are, here we go.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.165
Yeah. Oh!

12:06.926 --> 12:09.668
You just can't...
Okay, anybody else want to go?

12:09.829 --> 12:12.673
Okay, who's gonna go?
You? Okay, on you go.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.548
All right, there we go.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.084
Home, sweet home.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.619
Did you enjoy that?
Yes.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.958
You're really good, Dad.
Thank you.

12:29.882 --> 12:32.556
Bye, Dad.
All right.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.460
Bye, champ.
Bye.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.693
I'll see you Saturday, okay?
Okay.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.564
Hey, Matt.
Hello, George.

12:39.726 --> 12:40.864
He did great.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.406
<i>Anderson pushes the
ball up center, looking to pass,</i>

12:52.872 --> 12:57.446
<i>Trying to make his move,
but instead makes a run for the...</i>

12:57.610 --> 12:59.954
- Hello, Stace.
<i>- Hey, am I bothering you?</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:01.888
No, no. I was just, um...

13:02.048 --> 13:03.493
I was in a meeting.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.631
You always were good
at first impressions, weren't you?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.094
What do you mean?

13:08.254 --> 13:12.669
Well, you were such a splash at practice
that the parents want you to coach.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.772
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

13:15.928 --> 13:19.273
Yeah, I know. The kids loved you.
Lewis won't shut up about it.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.743
What about the coach they have?
<i>I don't know.</i>

13:22.902 --> 13:25.348
He doesn't have time.
They want you to do it.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.507
I'm flattered, Stace. Really, I am.

13:27.674 --> 13:31.486
But I'm kind of in the middle of
a couple of things right now...

13:31.644 --> 13:34.853
George, when was the last time
you did anything for Lewis?

13:35.014 --> 13:37.620
And I don't mean
a couple of hours at the park.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.924
<i>Okay, just for once... Just for once.</i>

13:41.487 --> 13:42.864
...do something for him.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.929
Okay, everybody. Now listen up.
Now, this is Lewis' dad, George.

13:50.096 --> 13:53.873
He's your new coach. I'm gonna be the
assistant coach. Which I'm fine with.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.814
Thanks a lot, Coach Jacob.

13:58.971 --> 14:04.148
Uh, in any event, I'm Lewis' dad
and I've never coached before,

14:04.310 --> 14:07.621
but I have played the game
since I was your age,

14:07.780 --> 14:10.818
and ifs a great game.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.725
The only thing I'm gonna
ask you to do on your own,

14:13.886 --> 14:16.890
do 10 minutes a day
passing the ball about.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.399
Anybody you can find.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.368
I mean, you guys have all
got a brother or a mother

14:21.527 --> 14:24.007
or a sister or somebody. Yeah.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.838
Coach, I had a sister,
but she died.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.736
Oh, really?

14:29.902 --> 14:32.178
I have a brother.
Should I play with him?

14:32.338 --> 14:36.809
Yeah, that would... That'd be good.
Coach, my grandpa died of smoking.

14:37.477 --> 14:41.425
Coach? My dad sleeps in the maid's
room, and my mom cries at night.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.557
Okay, come on, kids, let's take the field.
Okay.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.925
All right?
Excellent. Beautiful.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.760
There you go.
Keep it on the ground.

14:51.924 --> 14:55.565
On you go, Lewis. Show them
how it's done. Well done.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.435
You've really got them hustling.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.372
Hey, Carl King. Hey

14:59.532 --> 15:03.571
I'm Hunter's dad. Where is that guy?
Told him I'd come by after work.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.181
Welcome.
George Dryer.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.215
That's right.
I gotta say,

15:07.373 --> 15:12.220
I was a little bit thrilled when I found
out I had a soccer great coaching my boy.

15:12.378 --> 15:16.121
You were a great, great player.
Really, really.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.852
Those days are gone.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.190
Oh, no, no.
We looked you up on YouTube.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.095
You were one tough
son of a bitch.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.793
I mean, I used to
play baseball in college.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.302
Nothing anything like
on your level, though.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.134
I don't want to take your time.

15:30.296 --> 15:34.108
I just wanted to let you know
how much I really, really appreciate

15:34.267 --> 15:37.908
what you're doing for my son
and for all the other kids out here.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.277
You could be doing
so many more glamorous things.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.647
Pfft. I don't know about that.

15:42.809 --> 15:47.485
Look, I do this every year. I sponsor
the team. It pays for the trophies.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.423
It buys the uniforms, what not.
It's for the kids.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.493
Wow, I'm sure everyone appreciates it.
Yeah, yeah.

15:54.654 --> 15:59.603
And if you want to let Hunter play goalie, great.
Just keep it low-key.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.295
Goalie it is.
Okay.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.770
And I have a daughter.
Sings like Barbra Streisand.

16:04.931 --> 16:08.401
She sings the national anthem
before a game, so much the better.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.246
Just keep it...
Low-key.

16:12.405 --> 16:16.353
You'll get to know me, I'm always
looking for something interesting.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.319
- Hunter, you listen to Coach Dryer.
- All right, Dad.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.083
Listen, well done, guys.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.282
Hey, Denise.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.587
Hey, Barb.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.253
So who's the new soccer coach?

16:27.420 --> 16:28.956
I don't know.

16:29.121 --> 16:32.125
It's gotta be Stacie's ex,
the soccer player.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.998
Soccer player?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.468
Really.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.005
So, what does he do now?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.871
What do you need him to do?
That's not what I...

16:40.032 --> 16:42.603
Through with men.
Oh, come on.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.772
Hey, Mom.
Hey, sweetheart.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.943
Hey, how was it?
It was good.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.451
Great to see you, Barb.
Bye. You ready?

16:50.610 --> 16:51.816
Mm-hm.

17:04.390 --> 17:09.567
<i>You have 15 new messages.</i>

17:09.729 --> 17:11.731
<i>Hi, coach, this is Aaron's mom.</i>

17:11.897 --> 17:15.367
<i>Um, Coach Len had promised Aaron
he could play offense opening day</i>

17:15.535 --> 17:20.348
<i>so hopefully none of that has changed.
Call me at 555-0162.</i>

17:20.506 --> 17:21.984
<i>This is Jason's mom.</i>

17:22.141 --> 17:24.178
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

17:24.343 --> 17:28.587
<i>that Jason's been constipated
for over a week, and I just...</i>

17:28.748 --> 17:30.887
<i>Sorry, I must have run out of time.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:34.190
<i>I just thought you may not want to
run him too hard</i>

17:34.353 --> 17:36.026
<i>until he gets a chance to...</i>

17:36.188 --> 17:38.099
<i>Hi, coach. Zack's mom.</i>

17:38.257 --> 17:43.366
<i>Last year he was diagnosed with ADD
and took a vicious shot to the testicles</i>

17:43.529 --> 17:47.875
<i>so maybe it's best to keep him
as far away from the ball as possible.</i>

17:50.903 --> 17:55.010
Coach? Hi, can I
talk to you for a second?

17:55.174 --> 17:56.209
Yeah.

17:56.375 --> 18:00.448
Oh, I, um... Well, I just...
it'll just take a second.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.059
I wanted to know
how he was doing.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.250
How who's doing?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.626
Billy. I'm Billy's mom. You don't know that.
I'm Barb, hi.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.198
Oh, hey, Barb.
Hi.

18:09.355 --> 18:13.360
Um, so I know you watch him play. He's
not very good, but he tries so hard.

18:13.526 --> 18:17.440
And so I've been practicing
with him, but I'm so spastic.

18:17.597 --> 18:21.306
And I asked his dad to help too,
but he's just so busy,

18:21.467 --> 18:25.574
which is kind of the story of our
marriage and now our divorce and, um...

18:25.738 --> 18:28.810
Hey, Barb, he's doing just fine.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.922
You think so?
Yeah, I do.

18:32.078 --> 18:36.652
I mean a lot of these kids, they don't
have experience anyway, you know?

18:36.816 --> 18:41.265
Look, if you, need me to give him some
extra help then I'm happy to... I don't...

18:43.456 --> 18:45.936
Why are you crying?
I know, I'm sorry.

18:46.092 --> 18:49.266
Okay, thank you. You're right.
It's gonna be fine.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.766
Okay, okay.
Let's win this game.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.914
Win this game, yeah. All right.

18:57.069 --> 19:01.518
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

19:01.674 --> 19:05.417
<i>By the dawn's early light</i>

19:06.245 --> 19:10.284
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

19:10.449 --> 19:14.295
<i>At the twilight's last gleaming</i>

19:14.453 --> 19:17.627
All right, folks,
so it's my first game as coach.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.327
I want you to show me
what you've got, all right?

19:20.493 --> 19:25.169
And I want you to go out there and show
those wankers what you got, all right?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.867
Now I want you to be killers.

19:27.033 --> 19:31.140
I want you to talk to each other. I want
you to pass the ball to each other.

19:31.303 --> 19:35.718
And remember, you can't score
if you don't shoot. Ready for that?

19:35.875 --> 19:36.945
Yeah!

19:37.109 --> 19:39.851
Come around, come in.
Okay, hands out.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.960
One, two, three. Go, Cyclones.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.232
Now, see, the idea
is that we all do it together, okay?

19:49.388 --> 19:53.632
So on three let's try it again.
One, two, three.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.500
Go, Cyclones!

19:59.532 --> 20:02.069
Let's get these wankers.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.389
Lewis, you've gotta get the ball forward.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.882
Well played. Let's go, now. Let's go.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.419
That's it, that's it. Come on, come on.
Come on. Move up, guys.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.559
Aaron didn't want to
leave practice.

20:15.715 --> 20:20.027
I don't think Jason's father has spent
three straight hours with him in months.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.325
Look, I actually caught Brian

20:22.488 --> 20:25.662
practicing a Scottish accent
in the mirror this morning.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.874
Keep it going, Lewis.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.010
Yeah!

20:41.173 --> 20:43.744
Yeah! Yes!

20:43.909 --> 20:46.048
Finally, we're on the board.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.424
Lewis.

20:51.684 --> 20:55.632
Coach seems like a pretty solid guy.
Yeah. Heh.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.359
He's pretty good looking too,
huh?

20:59.191 --> 21:02.798
Eh. You're better looking.
What do you mean by that?

21:02.962 --> 21:06.307
I don't wanna marry him,
I'm just saying he's good looking.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.967
Okay.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.705
He's good with the kids too.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.072
Right?

21:14.607 --> 21:18.145
That's the stuff, that's the stuff.
That's what I'm talking about.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.483
High five, high five, Lewis.

21:22.414 --> 21:26.294
So I got your toothbrush in here.
Your pajamas in here.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.126
Mom, I'll be fine.
Make sure he takes a shower.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.460
He can use the pool.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.728
Oh, that's very funny.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.338
Showers and brush his teeth it is.

21:35.494 --> 21:39.499
All right, well, he's all yours.
Hey, have fun. Have fun, okay?

21:39.665 --> 21:42.111
It's one night, Mom.
It's gonna be good.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.612
We'll have a great night.
Bye.

21:51.277 --> 21:56.124
Hi, you're Lewis' Dad?
I'm Denise, Samantha's mom.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.827
Have we met before?
Not that I remember, and I'd remember.

22:02.288 --> 22:06.703
It's just you look very familiar to me.
Oh... I get that all the time.

22:06.859 --> 22:10.636
Help me out. How do I know you?
Okay. Um...

22:10.796 --> 22:14.369
Doctors tell me running back
Rolando Jones has suffered a torn ACL

22:14.533 --> 22:17.207
and will not be returning
for the second half.

22:17.369 --> 22:21.476
You were a sportscaster on TV.
Yes, I was, I was.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.382
You see, you're not the only one
who used to be someone, coach.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.324
Well, I'll see you when I see you.
Yeah, see you.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.660
That's your house? It's huge.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.526
No, it's the little
house here across the driveway.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.135
Here we go, not bad
for a couple of bachelors.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.334
What do you think? Like it?
Yeah.

22:41.493 --> 22:46.499
I've still got work to do, but it’s gonna
look pretty great when it's finished.

22:46.665 --> 22:51.671
So that's my bedroom
and not to mention,

22:53.239 --> 22:55.981
your very own room.
Not bad, eh?

22:56.141 --> 22:58.314
Yeah.
Good, good.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.479
I thought you and I
could fix it up.

23:00.646 --> 23:06.028
Maybe we could see if a little bit of
Mom's good taste has rubbed off on you.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.861
Is this me?
Yeah. Of course that's you.

23:11.657 --> 23:16.367
That's me, you and your mom in Italy.
We used to have a place by the lake.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.066
Really? Did I like it?
Yeah, you loved it.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.878
Uh, we'd put these
little floaties on you

23:23.035 --> 23:25.879
and take you out to the lake
and take you swimming.

23:26.038 --> 23:30.077
You were like a fish. You were a
better swimmer than your old man.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.619
I don't remember.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.281
Hm.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.271
All right, buddy.

23:59.204 --> 24:00.774
Good night.
Good night.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.783
Don't dream of scary monsters.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.281
"Thinking of you"? Oh, shit.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.116
Dad?

24:36.275 --> 24:37.618
Hey, you okay?

24:37.776 --> 24:40.086
I had a bad dream.

24:40.245 --> 24:44.159
Oh, really, what happened?

24:44.316 --> 24:49.288
I dreamt I was playing soccer,
and I looked down and I had no feet.

24:49.455 --> 24:54.097
No. The no-feet soccer dream?
You can't play soccer with no feet.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.829
Dad?
Yeah?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.201
I wanna call Mom.

24:57.629 --> 25:01.304
Why do you want to do that?
We can work this out ourselves.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.448
We're a couple of big, tough,
grown men here.

25:04.603 --> 25:08.949
Dad, I wanna go home.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.614
Hey. Go hop in my bed, 10 minutes
and then off to your room.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.192
Hey, hey, here.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.454
Bye, Dad.
Bye-bye, Lewis.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.795
Well, so much for
a fun first sleep over, huh?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.638
Good night.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.875
Will you just give him
some time?

25:38.203 --> 25:40.513
You know you didn't lose him
overnight.

25:43.008 --> 25:47.855
How did you get to be so much
more grown-up than me, Stace?

25:48.013 --> 25:49.651
Somebody had to.

25:53.519 --> 25:56.591
Good night, George.
Good night.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.908
Hey, there's Dad.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.544
Yep, there he is.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.173
Okay. Bye, Mom.
Bye.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.778
Hey, Dad.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.110
Hey, kiddo.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.048
You're looking
very sharp there.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.051
What's the story?
I don't know.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.553
How are you, man?
Good.

26:19.711 --> 26:22.590
Hey, George, George!
Yeah, I'll call you back.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.388
What are you doing,
you staying out of trouble?

26:25.551 --> 26:27.895
I'm trying my best.

26:28.053 --> 26:29.361
Hey, look Patti and I,

26:29.521 --> 26:32.229
we're putting together
this soiree for Friday.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.395
We wanted to know if you could join us.
This Friday?

26:35.561 --> 26:38.132
Personally, I'd be
very grateful if you could.

26:38.297 --> 26:42.074
I've got these guys I'm doing a deal with.
They would love to meet you.

26:42.234 --> 26:46.740
I think you'll have a great time. I put
together a really good group of people.

26:46.905 --> 26:50.045
Be a lot of opportunities there
if you know what I mean.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.921
Yeah, okay.
That makes me very happy.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.559
I take care of my friends. You're
gonna find out that about me.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.261
I take care of my friends.
There it goes again. Heh.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.420
See you.
Okay.

27:01.587 --> 27:05.262
Yeah, Sean. No, I think
he's a piece of shit. I don't care...

27:05.424 --> 27:07.426
Coach? Hi.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.231
Hey, Barb.
Hi.

27:09.394 --> 27:12.773
I just wanted to thank you
for the other day.

27:13.799 --> 27:17.611
Don't worry, I'm not gonna have another
melt down on you again. Ha-ha-ha.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.680
I just wanted to say thank you.

27:19.838 --> 27:23.945
You're welcome, Barb.
That's fine, you're welcome.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.688
You seem to be getting over it...
Thank you.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.183
Okay.

27:30.415 --> 27:33.021
Oh, good ball. Yeah, that's it.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.792
Pull his jersey a bit.
Yeah, give him a little elbow.

27:36.955 --> 27:41.131
Get a good night's sleep, coach?
I'm a night owl too.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.944
Sorry, I didn't get your
e-mail till this... No, relax.

27:48.100 --> 27:52.276
I just wanted to tell you
that I ran into a mutual friend of ours.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.940
Chip Johnston. Uh-huh.
Chip Johnston?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.643
No way.
Mm-hm.

27:56.808 --> 28:01.018
I was at CSA when he first started there.
God, what a small world, huh?

28:01.180 --> 28:05.890
So sports-casting, huh, George?
Apparently pretty damn good too.

28:06.051 --> 28:08.395
He said that?
You think he was for real?

28:08.554 --> 28:11.501
I'll find out tonight.
He gave me a copy to watch.

28:11.657 --> 28:14.695
So who knows, maybe
I know someone I can give it to.

28:15.661 --> 28:18.699
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
I'll let you know, coach.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.712
Come on, let's go.
Ah... Come on. This is sad.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.321
I got a stack of twenties here,
doesn't anybody want one?

28:32.477 --> 28:35.583
Well, then hit
the Gatorade bottle.

28:35.747 --> 28:38.990
I bet you coach can do it.
A great idea. Come here.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.757
No, that's all right. Thank you.
Lewis, come on.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.922
Who wants to see coach
hit the bottle?

28:44.089 --> 28:45.898
Come on, come on.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.368
We don't do the bottle,
we do the crossbar.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.905
Oh, we can do the crossbar.
Hit the crossbar.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.167
<i>Coach, coach, coach.</i>

28:52.331 --> 28:56.279
But you're a pro, so we're gonna
move it back right here. Come on.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.711
All right, all right, all right.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.244
Okay, can I get a warm-up shot?

29:01.406 --> 29:04.114
There's no warm-up shots
in life, George.

29:08.780 --> 29:09.781
Whoa!

29:11.116 --> 29:13.187
Whoa! Yes!

29:18.724 --> 29:22.228
Wait, wait, wait. Okay,
we're gonna make it interesting.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.135
Anybody can hit the crossbar.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.776
Honestly, I gotta go.
Can you hit this?

29:27.966 --> 29:30.572
I got a hundred bucks
says you cannot hit it.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.547
A hundred bucks. Hundred bucks.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.309
Hit the bottle.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.283
We got 200 right here.
Two hundred.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.882
Come on.
Come on.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.991
Okay, all right, all right.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.491
Come on, money plays.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.596
<i>Coach, coach, coach.</i>

29:53.892 --> 29:55.235
Yeah!

30:09.975 --> 30:12.319
Somebody comes to

30:12.477 --> 30:14.150
"The queen wants to meet you."
Ha-ha-ha!

30:14.479 --> 30:18.791
And she walks into the locker room,
right in front of me.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.794
I'm standing stark naked
in front of Queen Elizabeth.

30:21.953 --> 30:26.026
And I said, "Your Majesty,
I apologize. I'm so sorry."

30:26.191 --> 30:28.501
And she looks me up and down
and she says:

30:28.660 --> 30:31.641
"Not at all, young man.
It's an absolute pleasure."

30:33.031 --> 30:35.443
Come on, George.
Come on, let's take a lap.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.848
I like you, George, I like you.
You're a guy.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.009
You're comfortable with yourself.
You don't give a shit.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.855
You don't seem to give
a shit much, either.

30:45.010 --> 30:50.016
Ooh... Oh, no, no, no. I just
know how to hide it, that's all.

30:50.182 --> 30:53.527
I don't know what it is about you.
It's crazy, but I trust you.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.564
I trust that mug.

30:56.722 --> 31:01.137
For instance, the woman
standing by the fireplace,

31:01.293 --> 31:03.796
the blond,

31:03.962 --> 31:09.071
I can comfortably tell you
that I am not sleeping with her.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.304
Okay.

31:10.469 --> 31:14.383
But I can't say the same thing
for the woman that she's talking to.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.681
Sweetheart.

31:18.744 --> 31:22.590
Patti, have you met the coach?
George, this is my wife, Patti.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.193
Hi.
How do you do?

31:24.349 --> 31:26.727
Now I ask you, is she gorgeous

31:26.885 --> 31:28.831
or is she gorgeous?

31:28.987 --> 31:32.230
You had it right the first time.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. King.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.395
Please, call me Patti.
Oh, the councilman's leaving.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.871
I'd better massage this.
I'll be right back.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.203
It's a beautiful place you have here.

31:44.369 --> 31:47.873
Mm. He's laid out quite a spread
for you, hasn't he?

31:48.707 --> 31:51.017
No, I don't think it's for me exactly.

31:51.176 --> 31:55.124
Oh, no. I've thrown enough parties to
known for whom they're thrown and why.

31:56.448 --> 32:00.419
The only thing I can’t figure out is he
invites one woman he's sleeping with.

32:00.585 --> 32:05.034
I'm not complaining.
He takes very good care of me.

32:05.190 --> 32:09.900
I just like to know which one it is.
It makes me feel better somehow.

32:10.061 --> 32:13.201
I'm sure you're just
being paranoid, Mrs. King.

32:13.365 --> 32:18.713
Ha-ha-ha. That's sweet. You barely know
him yet you're already defending him.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.745
You know, I have crazy intuition.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.912
I watched you coaching
those kids and I said to myself:

32:26.077 --> 32:29.581
"Patti, now that's a good person."

32:30.782 --> 32:33.490
Thank you for taking
such nice care of my son.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.766
I see a friend standing all alone.

32:36.922 --> 32:40.631
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Nice to meet you, George.

32:49.668 --> 32:54.276
Well, don't just stare at it,
take it for a spin. Come on.

32:54.439 --> 32:56.612
Really?
Get in.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.345
Wow.

33:00.345 --> 33:04.293
Lewis saw her in the park the other day.
Thought she was a rocket ship.

33:04.449 --> 33:07.919
My friend, put that piece of crap
back of the parking lot.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.093
Hey, thank you for coming.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.497
You were a huge hit.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.464
See you at practice, coach.
Keep it till then.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.304
I told you,
I take care of my friends.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.408
George.
Oh, hey, Matt.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.577
What are you doing?
It's after midnight.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.844
I know.

34:38.009 --> 34:41.456
Hey, I was wondering
if I could talk to Stacie.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.681
It's about Lewis.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.627
All right, just hold on. Just
hold on for a second, all right?

34:51.623 --> 34:53.226
Shit.

35:04.235 --> 35:05.373
Hey.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.281
Hey.

35:09.074 --> 35:12.317
What? What is it, George?
What's wrong?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.319
I was just...

35:15.480 --> 35:17.960
I was just driving by and...
In a Ferrari.

35:18.583 --> 35:19.926
Oh.

35:21.386 --> 35:24.128
Yeah. You like it?

35:25.090 --> 35:26.797
Yes.

35:27.258 --> 35:32.435
You know, actually, though,
it made me think.

35:32.597 --> 35:34.474
Remember Italy?

35:34.766 --> 35:37.178
Remember that place we rented?

35:37.335 --> 35:38.837
We had the Ferrari.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.673
George, it is late, okay?

35:40.839 --> 35:43.979
If you wanna talk to me about Lewis,
call me in the morning.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.621
Hey, Stace? Stace.

35:45.777 --> 35:48.280
What?
Do you ever think...?

35:48.446 --> 35:50.858
I'm just saying, but you ever think

35:51.016 --> 35:55.089
what it might have been like
if I hadn't screwed it all up?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.629
Yeah, I used to.

36:01.926 --> 36:04.304
All the time, I wondered.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.471
You were the most exciting thing
that ever happened to me, George.

36:11.269 --> 36:16.651
One second I'm a 23-year-old from
Virginia backpacking around England

36:16.808 --> 36:20.483
and the next I'm falling in love
with a soccer star

36:20.645 --> 36:25.560
and vacationing in the most
incredible villas in Tuscany.

36:26.217 --> 36:28.322
So you do remember.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.296
Yeah, I remember the pizza too.

36:35.326 --> 36:36.396
Pizza, right.

36:38.396 --> 36:41.206
Honey, is everything all right?

36:41.366 --> 36:44.540
Yeah, babe. Sorry,
just two seconds, I'll be in.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.205
Okay.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.744
I'm concerned Lewis
has a learning disability.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.682
You are?

36:54.079 --> 36:56.525
No, I'm just saying
you can tell that to Matt.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.554
Oh, oh.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.231
Okay.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.334
All right, good night.
Good night.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.935
Good night.

37:10.195 --> 37:13.699
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.851
Hey.
Hi.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.049
How are you?

37:31.216 --> 37:34.925
I got your address off the team
roster and I was in the neighborhood

37:35.086 --> 37:39.626
so I was like, "Wow, that is a...
Your house is huge."

37:39.791 --> 37:43.295
I guess I should have figured, but...
I live in the guesthouse.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.436
Oh, cool.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.573
Uh, is everything all right?
Yeah, yeah.

37:50.735 --> 37:55.150
Fridays are just kind of hard because
I drop Billy off at his Dad's house.

37:55.306 --> 37:59.550
I thought I would have all these
plans and I'd sleep in really late,

37:59.711 --> 38:03.215
but I always end up
just driving around in circles.

38:03.381 --> 38:06.260
So... what's that?

38:06.417 --> 38:07.828
I didn't say anything.

38:08.586 --> 38:11.499
Oh, I thought I heard you invite
me in for a drink. Ha-ha-ha.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.932
No, no, I was just listening to you.
Oh.

38:17.462 --> 38:20.238
Would you like...?
Yeah, let's have a drink.

38:21.566 --> 38:24.274
You should plant some flowers
in here or something.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.642
What were the colors
of your soccer team?

38:26.805 --> 38:29.843
Because you could probably
get flowers in those colors.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.192
I haven't been in
a bachelor pad in years.

38:38.349 --> 38:39.794
Wow!

38:41.853 --> 38:44.800
Cheers, to our kids.
Yeah.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.492
Remember them?
To our kids.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.467
Mm.
Mm.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.299
Mm.

38:50.929 --> 38:54.433
You must miss Lewis living with you.
You guys are so close.

38:54.599 --> 38:58.172
Sure I do, yeah.
Yeah.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.146
I just decided something recently.
What's that?

39:01.306 --> 39:04.719
I decided to start dating again.
Uh-huh.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.049
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.

39:07.212 --> 39:10.318
I know. I figure I'm worth
dinner and a movie, right?

39:10.481 --> 39:15.055
I mean, I know I'm not Penelope Cruz,
but could be worse. I could be worse.

39:15.220 --> 39:18.793
That would be a good line for the
Internet, "You've dated worse."

39:18.957 --> 39:21.995
Ha-ha-ha. I actually am
on the Internet.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.198
Can I show you my profile?
I'd love your opinion.

39:25.363 --> 39:30.335
Yeah, well, I'm the last guy
you want advice from, but...

39:31.736 --> 39:33.079
"Perfect mate."

39:33.238 --> 39:38.085
I have to do my secret password
so look away. Okay.

39:38.243 --> 39:41.087
Look at all this going on, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

39:41.246 --> 39:45.558
Here's me thinking that sitting around
in my boxers is gonna get me a date.

39:45.717 --> 39:51.167
No... I mean you probably
could. I know that...

39:51.322 --> 39:55.862
I mean, it's not like a really sexy
picture, but I didn't wanna look skanky.

39:58.096 --> 40:01.339
So if you didn't know me,
would you call me?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.208
Yeah.

40:03.368 --> 40:04.745
Really?
Yeah.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.883
Absolutely I would call you.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.416
Your inbox in gonna be full.
Ooh.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.118
You're an attractive woman, Barb.

40:13.278 --> 40:19.058
You just gotta have a little more...
A little more confidence in yourself.

40:22.587 --> 40:27.559
Um, okay, I think I'm gonna go now.
Yeah.

40:27.725 --> 40:29.727
I should go because...

40:30.428 --> 40:33.409
Um, thank you so much
for the half a beer

40:33.564 --> 40:38.980
and, um, I'll see you at practice.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.946
Sure.

40:41.806 --> 40:46.755
If you did know me and you
saw that ad, would you call?

40:46.911 --> 40:49.755
Yeah. I would.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.929
Okay. Bye.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.428
Good night.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.913
Hi.

41:16.607 --> 41:20.987
You're not gonna cry again, are you?
No, I promise I won't cry.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.955
But you're gonna have to take it
really slow, okay?

41:28.252 --> 41:30.789
Aah!
Son of a bitch.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.992
- Hello.
- George, did I wake you? It's Carl.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.796
Hey, Carl. What's up?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.735
I hate to bother you with this,

42:10.895 --> 42:14.035
but do you happen to keep
any cash around the house?

42:14.665 --> 42:16.474
Do I keep cash around the house?

42:16.634 --> 42:21.083
$10,000 to be exact. Look, I know
it's a lot, but it's for my bail.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.583
Oh, my God. Are you in jail?

42:23.741 --> 42:27.348
Yeah, it's so stupid.
I'm embarrassed to even...

42:27.512 --> 42:31.858
<i>I had a few too many last night,
some guy was looking at Patti...</i>

42:32.016 --> 42:34.189
I don't want to bore you with all of it.

42:34.352 --> 42:38.391
Actually, Carl, I gotta take Lewis
to his soccer game in, like, two hours.

42:38.556 --> 42:42.197
Swing by the house, grab the money,
come down here and pay my bail,

42:42.360 --> 42:44.067
and Bob's your uncle.

42:45.029 --> 42:47.339
George, hi.
Hi, Mrs. King.

42:47.498 --> 42:51.173
I just came to get the... The bail.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.841
The bail.
Yeah.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.542
Um, I'm so sorry, come in.

42:59.377 --> 43:02.449
This is so embarrassing. Do
you want something to drink?

43:02.613 --> 43:04.718
No, I'm good.
I've gotta get a move on.

43:04.882 --> 43:08.295
Okay, I'm just
so over this, George.

43:08.453 --> 43:11.127
I don't want to get involved
in your business.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.633
I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

43:13.791 --> 43:17.762
He does it all the time.
It's just one of his things.

43:17.929 --> 43:22.400
He gets kind of jealous sometimes.
Don't you think he should stay there?

43:22.567 --> 43:24.706
Hey, buddy, Carl King.
Come on.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.247
He'll be out in a second.
Just take it easy.

43:27.405 --> 43:28.975
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, Stacie.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.882
Where the hell are you?
Is Lewis there?

43:32.043 --> 43:34.580
<i>- Yeah, hold on.</i>
<i>- Dad?</i>

43:34.745 --> 43:37.385
Hey, kiddo. Hey, listen.

43:37.548 --> 43:40.290
I've got a surprise for you.
Remember that cool car you saw?

43:40.451 --> 43:42.761
You mean the rocket-ship car?
Yeah.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.730
How would you like to go in that?
Great.

43:45.890 --> 43:49.167
The only thing is
might be a little late.

43:49.927 --> 43:53.136
We're not gonna miss the game?
<i>No, no, no. We're not.</i>

43:53.297 --> 43:55.504
I'll be there before you know it.
<i>Okay.</i>

43:55.666 --> 43:57.441
All right, kiddo.

43:59.504 --> 44:01.780
Do not go in there.
Wasn't planning on it.

44:01.939 --> 44:04.749
Let's get out of here. I hope Patti
didn't bust your balls too much.

44:04.909 --> 44:07.822
Trust me, she's no angel.
Ha, ha.

44:07.979 --> 44:10.459
She's always threatening
to walk out.

44:10.615 --> 44:15.189
Hinting at other men.
I even had her followed for a time.

44:15.353 --> 44:19.995
Thousands of dollars for a tour
of the Beltway's finest shopping malls.

44:20.858 --> 44:24.704
I'm not letting her go, George,
not to another man.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.473
Not a living man.

44:36.874 --> 44:39.013
I know, I know. Hey, champ.
Bye, Mom.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.815
Bye, baby.
See you soon.

44:40.978 --> 44:43.549
I'll have him back by 9.
Whoa, Dad, cool car.

44:43.714 --> 44:48.629
Yeah, you like it?
Okay, let's go have some fun.

44:48.786 --> 44:52.791
Dad, this is so cool.
It's cool, huh?

44:52.957 --> 44:56.632
Oh, hey, careful with those buttons.
That alarm is a bit sensitive.

44:59.497 --> 45:01.568
Dad, you know we missed the game.

45:05.203 --> 45:07.080
Yes.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.875
Hey, I'm sorry, champ.

45:12.476 --> 45:14.387
It's okay.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.432
All right, Lewis.

45:27.592 --> 45:31.699
Let me ask you a question, and
I want you to be totally honest with me.

45:32.597 --> 45:36.670
If I let you take this wheel,
do you think you could handle this thing?

45:37.068 --> 45:39.605
Are you serious?
Do I look serious?

45:40.738 --> 45:44.185
How many kids do you know
get to see a soccer game on a Sunday?

45:44.342 --> 45:46.049
A lot.
A lot, right?

45:47.378 --> 45:49.619
But how many get to drive a Ferrari?

45:53.117 --> 45:54.892
- Ready?
- Yes!

45:55.052 --> 45:56.861
Let's go!

46:01.359 --> 46:03.361
Faster?
Faster.

46:03.527 --> 46:06.133
Careful, we're coming to a bend.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.072
Nice and easy.

46:08.232 --> 46:09.939
There we go.

46:11.402 --> 46:13.245
Look at you, you're a natural.

46:15.806 --> 46:16.978
- All right.
- All right?

46:17.141 --> 46:19.621
Yeah!
Keep your eye on the road, Lewis.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.723
Yeah!

46:22.546 --> 46:24.048
Faster?
Yes.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.255
I'm giving you control now, okay?
Yes.

46:27.418 --> 46:30.888
Around the bend.
There you go.

46:31.055 --> 46:34.468
You got it. You got it.

46:36.294 --> 46:39.070
Yeah.
All right!

46:39.230 --> 46:40.504
Yeah!
Awesome!

46:40.665 --> 46:42.269
Awesome!
Whoo!

46:45.603 --> 46:46.775
Oh, yeah!

46:46.937 --> 46:48.416
Lewis!

46:59.350 --> 47:01.830
Let's not tell your mom
about this.

47:06.257 --> 47:08.259
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

47:08.426 --> 47:09.837
Can I ask you something?

47:09.994 --> 47:11.029
Yeah.

47:11.195 --> 47:13.436
Are you sad Mom's
getting married?

47:17.301 --> 47:18.541
Yeah.

47:20.304 --> 47:22.648
But Matt seems like a nice guy.

47:22.807 --> 47:24.980
Yeah. Me and mom talked
about it

47:25.142 --> 47:27.679
and I decided I'm not gonna
call him Dad.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.784
Do you think that'll
hurt his feelings?

47:32.483 --> 47:35.362
I think whatever makes you
feel good, you should do.

47:46.797 --> 47:48.299
- Hello?
<i>- George, it's Denise.</i>

47:48.466 --> 47:49.638
I watched your tape.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.713
Your posture needs work,
you could use direction,

47:52.870 --> 47:54.508
but you've got some skills.

47:54.672 --> 47:56.345
Wow, thank you.
<i>Guess what?</i>

47:56.507 --> 47:59.181
ESPN are looking to expand
their soccer coverage.

47:59.343 --> 48:01.482
They're meeting with people
right now.

48:01.645 --> 48:05.058
ESPN? As in the ESPN?

48:05.216 --> 48:07.253
We should redo your tape,
George.

48:07.418 --> 48:09.898
<i>It's now or never, George.</i>

48:10.921 --> 48:12.696
Why are we at Samantha's house?

48:12.857 --> 48:16.600
The thing is, champ, I'm trying to
get this job as a sportscaster

48:16.761 --> 48:19.071
and Samantha's mom
is gonna help me.

48:19.230 --> 48:20.868
Why now?

48:21.031 --> 48:24.877
If I don't do it now, then they'll
give the job to somebody else.

48:26.370 --> 48:27.542
Hi.
Hey.

48:27.705 --> 48:29.412
- Hi, Lewis.
- Hey.

48:29.573 --> 48:31.246
Come on in.
Hey, how are you?

48:35.880 --> 48:39.293
Wait till you see what Samantha has.
You're gonna have fun.

48:39.450 --> 48:42.124
You wanna play a game?
It's called "Angry Birds."

48:42.286 --> 48:44.789
Hi. Hey, Lewis.

48:44.955 --> 48:48.528
Aracelli, there's pasta and
garlic bread for the kids, okay?

48:48.692 --> 48:52.299
Here. We're going to the studio.
See you guys.

48:52.463 --> 48:54.739
- How long are we gonna be?
- An hour, max.

48:56.033 --> 48:58.377
You hear that, buddy?
We're gonna be an hour.

48:58.536 --> 49:00.311
All right. Before you know it.

49:01.305 --> 49:04.286
In three, two, one. Recording.

49:04.442 --> 49:07.946
The Los Angeles Galaxy came into...
George, where's the fire?

49:08.112 --> 49:10.319
And don't worry about the prompter.

49:10.481 --> 49:13.928
You got a lot of lights in
here, I'm just... Recording.

49:14.585 --> 49:16.724
Let's go. Okay,
right down the lens.

49:16.887 --> 49:18.093
He was scoring...

49:18.255 --> 49:20.758
Tell us the story. ESPN.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.268
Recording.
Now?

49:22.426 --> 49:24.599
Yeah. Recording.
Okay, loosen up.

49:24.762 --> 49:27.333
Just go for it.
Just go for it, George.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.244
The Los Angeles Galaxy came into
Washington today and beat DC United.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.147
Gotta say, what's going on
with DC United nowadays?

49:37.308 --> 49:42.417
Danny Allsopp brought his A-game,
scoring a bicycle kick goal off the corner,

49:42.580 --> 49:45.083
but he and the rest of
the black and red

49:45.249 --> 49:50.323
couldn't put a stop to a particularly
ferocious and unstoppable Galaxy attack:

49:50.488 --> 49:54.959
Landon Donovan, the Galaxy captain
and lean, mean scoring machine.

49:55.125 --> 49:59.005
Landon, you went to sleep
after the World Cup for a few months,

49:59.163 --> 50:02.303
but you're out of bed now
and I gotta say you go, Landon.

50:02.466 --> 50:05.504
Go on with your bad striker self.

50:05.669 --> 50:08.479
And that's it for tonight.
Back to you, Denise.

50:08.639 --> 50:11.313
Ha-ha-ha. Yes.

50:11.475 --> 50:14.513
Look at you, huh?
How good was that?

50:14.678 --> 50:16.680
I enjoyed that.
That was fun.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.623
You enjoyed it?
I really enjoyed that, George.

50:19.783 --> 50:23.663
Really, and you looked great.
Thank you.

50:23.821 --> 50:27.530
So how different was that
from coaching soccer?

50:28.492 --> 50:30.165
Mm, that's a good question.

50:30.327 --> 50:33.672
I mean, looking after 13 kids
is not exactly a piece of cake.

50:33.831 --> 50:39.509
Oh. Well, they say the parents require
the most work. What do you think?

50:39.670 --> 50:44.176
I guess I would take that
on a parent-by-parent basis.

50:44.341 --> 50:47.982
And the moms?
A single dad like yourself,

50:48.145 --> 50:52.525
do you find that a distraction
or inspiration?

50:53.350 --> 50:56.024
I would have to take that
on a mom-by-mom basis.

50:56.186 --> 51:00.191
And what about me?
Distraction or inspiration?

51:01.525 --> 51:05.940
Ahem. Listen, it's getting late.
I gotta go pick up Lewis.

51:06.096 --> 51:09.703
We should get going.
Yeah.

51:09.867 --> 51:11.540
Listen to me, I gotta... I can't.

51:11.702 --> 51:15.411
It's not as if I'm not leaving
my family, George.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.247
I'm just looking for laughs.

51:29.386 --> 51:33.801
We're back. Hi. Hi, sweetie.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.871
Hey, buddy. Hey, champ.

51:37.027 --> 51:41.772
Sorry we ran on a little long.
You ready to go?

51:41.932 --> 51:44.742
Yeah, okay? All right.

51:44.902 --> 51:47.382
Bye, George.
Bye. Bye, Samantha.

51:47.538 --> 51:50.610
Come on, it's late.
Let's go.

51:52.076 --> 51:54.420
Wonderful. It's 11:15, George.
I know.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.387
But we had fun,
didn't we, champ?

51:56.547 --> 51:58.288
Yeah.

51:58.449 --> 52:02.090
Yeah, I got that audition
as a sportscaster,

52:02.252 --> 52:05.233
but it was just
a little bit last minute.

52:06.256 --> 52:08.668
That's good. That's good.
I'm glad for you.

52:08.826 --> 52:12.103
It's all right. No one got hurt.
Everyone's home safe.

52:12.262 --> 52:13.969
Okay. Good night, George.

52:14.131 --> 52:17.943
All right. Good night, Matt.
Good night.

52:18.102 --> 52:20.462
You're gonna have to explain to me
what you saw in that guy.

52:43.027 --> 52:49.034
Mr. George, can you explain how you
drive a fancy car and still owe money?

52:49.199 --> 52:51.145
Yeah. No, I can't actually.
The thing is...

52:52.469 --> 52:55.643
No, there is no thing. There is only rent.
If I don't have by tomorrow...

52:55.806 --> 52:59.151
Shit. I'm so sorry.
Sorry, one second.

52:59.309 --> 53:01.016
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, George.</i>

53:01.178 --> 53:04.352
It's Patti.
<i>Patti, Mrs. King Patti?</i>

53:04.515 --> 53:07.018
Yes, yes, George.
It's Mrs. King.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.824
Um, listen,
can I call you back?

53:09.987 --> 53:14.834
You can talk to me when you get home.
I'm in your bed, George.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.670
I'm sorry. Where are you?

53:18.829 --> 53:21.969
<i>I'm in your bed.
This is quite some room.</i>

53:22.132 --> 53:27.013
It's a little Mid-Eastern for my taste,
but I must say your closets are fabulous.

53:28.672 --> 53:30.674
Wait, wait, Patti, wait.
Wait, Param!

53:30.841 --> 53:32.878
Don't... Param,
come here a second.

53:35.245 --> 53:39.990
I don't think that you're in my bedroom.
What?

53:40.384 --> 53:44.855
No, you think that you're in my bedroom,
but you're in my landlord's bedroom.

53:49.893 --> 53:50.928
Oh!

53:51.095 --> 53:52.574
Oh, my God.

53:53.530 --> 53:56.704
Where are you?
In the guest house across the driveway.

53:58.669 --> 54:02.276
Patti, just get out of there
now, okay?

54:02.439 --> 54:04.043
Mr. George.

54:10.013 --> 54:13.290
Uh, Param? Okay, yeah.

54:13.450 --> 54:18.229
I'm sorry I didn't sort you out before, but
I forgot I left the cash in my Ferrari.

54:18.388 --> 54:20.231
So how much is it?
900.

54:20.390 --> 54:23.064
900? Cash is good, yeah?
Yeah.

54:23.227 --> 54:26.765
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

54:26.930 --> 54:30.036
It's a beautiful night, huh? 7, 8.
Yeah.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.907
How much did you say?
900.

54:32.069 --> 54:34.242
9... 900. There you go.

54:34.404 --> 54:35.974
All right, buddy.

54:36.140 --> 54:41.249
I'll probably see you around,
maybe tomorrow or something.

54:47.951 --> 54:50.898
Okay, no, no, no. Out.
In.

54:51.054 --> 54:53.398
You know that I can't do this.
Oh, stop it.

54:53.557 --> 54:57.095
He lent you his Ferrari. He's more
possessive of that than of me.

54:57.261 --> 55:01.175
Whatever it is you got going on with
your husband, I want you to know

55:01.899 --> 55:03.469
I consider him a friend.

55:03.634 --> 55:08.674
I need you to put your clothes
back on and just leave.

55:08.839 --> 55:12.685
You're gonna tell him, aren't you?
No. God, no. I'm not gonna tell him.

55:13.477 --> 55:19.086
Okay, if you go now, just go
home, there's nothing to tell.

55:19.249 --> 55:22.992
Mrs. King, you're not moving.
I'm starting to feel a bit foolish.

55:23.153 --> 55:26.657
Oh, no, no. No reason
to feel foolish. Just go.

55:26.824 --> 55:30.431
You have no idea what he might do.
He's very vindictive, George.

55:30.594 --> 55:32.835
That's the point
I'm trying to make here.

55:32.996 --> 55:38.776
He's gonna ask me where I was
and I'm not a very good liar.

55:38.936 --> 55:41.644
I think I just need one drink.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.475
Okay. One drink.

55:51.315 --> 55:52.988
There you go.

55:53.150 --> 55:56.859
Well, aren't you
gonna have one?

55:57.020 --> 55:58.624
Just leave.

56:06.897 --> 56:11.312
I, um...
I need to use the bathroom.

56:18.008 --> 56:20.545
You don't know how many times
he's cheated on me.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.214
And I can't even
do unfaithful right.

56:23.380 --> 56:28.056
Mrs. King? You are a smart,

56:28.218 --> 56:32.360
a strong, beautiful woman.

56:32.522 --> 56:36.664
And I personally think

56:36.827 --> 56:41.105
that you shouldn't stay in a
marriage that you're not happy in.

56:45.202 --> 56:47.614
Oh, shit. That's probably Carl.

56:47.771 --> 56:50.377
What? Carl knows you're here?

56:50.540 --> 56:53.521
Yeah. Sometimes he has me followed.
What?

56:53.677 --> 56:55.350
He thinks I might cheat on him.

56:55.512 --> 56:59.756
Okay, okay. Stay in there, okay?
And don't come out.

57:14.798 --> 57:16.800
Param?
Mr. George,

57:16.967 --> 57:19.243
you gave me an extra hundred.
Oh. Uh...

57:20.404 --> 57:23.214
Yeah, thanks.

57:27.811 --> 57:31.384
Mr. George, how do you meet
all these beautiful women?

57:32.883 --> 57:34.920
Well, maybe ifs the accent.

57:37.621 --> 57:39.931
I have an accent too.

57:43.894 --> 57:47.467
George. George, I was looking for you.
Oh, hey, how's it going?

57:47.631 --> 57:51.943
Well, it turns out I'm not the only
person who thought you had style.

57:52.102 --> 57:55.845
My old station manager edited your tape.
He's gonna send it to Bristol.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.610
He thinks you have a shot.

57:57.774 --> 57:59.481
Wait, you serious?
I'm serious.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.281
Bristol, Connecticut?
Yeah.

58:01.445 --> 58:05.086
Just don't forget the girl who said it first.
No, no, I won't.

58:05.248 --> 58:06.522
Wow.

58:06.683 --> 58:08.026
Oh, George?

58:11.288 --> 58:15.430
When you're out there today
and you see me tug my ear like this.

58:16.593 --> 58:18.971
That means I'm imagining you
on top of me.

58:19.262 --> 58:21.299
Okay.
Okay.

58:21.465 --> 58:23.968
Well, I better get back
to the game, all right?

58:24.134 --> 58:26.808
Well, you have a great game.
Okay.

58:45.222 --> 58:48.328
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

58:48.492 --> 58:50.699
What's going on? You all right?
Nothing.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.171
All right, Lewis.
Here, your bag.

58:54.698 --> 58:56.177
Move forward, Scott.

58:56.333 --> 58:58.540
- Yeah, take it in.
- Come on, Cyclones.

58:58.702 --> 59:03.515
Use the mind, use the wing.
Nice one. Watch your man.

59:03.673 --> 59:07.211
Ah-ah-ah!
Nice play, Lewis. There you go.

59:13.183 --> 59:14.389
Hey.

59:15.085 --> 59:17.087
- Hey, hey.
<i>- Hi, coach, it's me.</i>

59:17.254 --> 59:18.324
I'm kind of busy.

59:18.488 --> 59:21.435
I'd say everything's great
except for this silly grin

59:21.591 --> 59:25.437
I can't seem to get off of my face
since the other night. Ha-ha-ha.

59:25.595 --> 59:27.233
Listen, I can't really talk.

59:27.397 --> 59:31.209
<i>I hope that it's not awkward
between us. We're both adults, single.</i>

59:31.368 --> 59:33.109
<i>And if it happens, great.</i>

59:33.270 --> 59:36.740
If not it's really only what's
best for the kids, right?

59:36.907 --> 59:38.716
Just, um...

59:39.609 --> 59:44.058
I'm a little busy right now,
but, I mean, we could...

59:44.214 --> 59:46.854
It was Lewis!
Yes!

59:47.551 --> 59:48.962
Well done, kiddo.

59:49.119 --> 59:52.896
Lewis, well done, champ.
Well done. Ha-ha-ha!

59:53.056 --> 59:55.400
That was great.
Didn't even see it!

59:58.562 --> 01:00:02.567
All right, come on, Cyclones.
Let's go, let's get another one.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.442
All right, come on.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.913
Let's get another one.
Come on, Cyclones.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.448
Nine.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:26.090
What the hell was that?
What are you playing at?

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:27.633
What the hell was that?

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.296
Is this about last night?

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:34.264
What's the matter?
Leave me alone!

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:37.776
I hate soccer, and I hate you!

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:58.129
Hello?
He doesn't hate me, right?

01:00:58.288 --> 01:01:00.666
No, of course he doesn't hate you.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.362
But he does want to quit the team,
George. Do you know that?

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:09.041
You know, I'm a bit lost
at sea here, Stace.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:12.476
I was thinking maybe you could
give me some parenting tips.

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:13.944
Basic dos and don'ts.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:17.608
Don't let your 10-year-old son
drive a Ferrari, that kind of thing?

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:21.449
My son has a big mouth, you know.
Honest. He gets that from me.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.057
I'm serious. Can we meet
for a drink maybe?

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.354
No. Absolutely not.
We can meet for coffee, though.

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:30.127
Dinner.
Lunch.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.664
Early dinner.
Late lunch.

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:35.667
I'm not budging on dinner.
I'm not the one asking for advice.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.236
Are you sure, no beer?

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:44.839
Well, so I read about this place online.
The true Virginia experience, it says.

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:49.677
Apparently, you have to really like,
you know, beat the stuffing out of it,

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:52.046
you know, to get to the good stuff.

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:56.548
All right, okay, you get it. Good?
Mm-hm.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:02:00.251
According to the Internet,
there's a real kick to the seasoning.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.421
I don't know, maybe
the Internet was wrong.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.061
Oh, here, here.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:13.175
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Waitress, two beers, please.

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:16.200
Wow.
Three more beers, please.

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:22.176
So I fall down the stairs, I stubbed
my toe, and I scream, "Shit."

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:24.012
And then the next five days,

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:28.452
Lewis is going around the house
going, "Shit, shit, shit." Heh.

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:29.682
I get it. Okay.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:33.419
Even when it's hard, even when you
want to be anywhere but there,

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:38.362
even when you feel like he doesn't
need you, trust me, he does.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:40.595
Here.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.861
What? Where?

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:44.266
You have some crab on your cheek.
Crap?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.033
Crab. Crab, on your cheek.
Crab. Okay.

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:49.541
Crab lips.
Gross.

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:57.650
You're the only woman
I ever really loved.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:01.818
Ha, ha. Stop it.
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.151
You know what I miss the most?

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:09.093
In the early years, when I used to play
and you were in the stands watching me.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:13.257
After every game, I would look for you
and I would wave to you. Remember?

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:14.424
Mm-hm.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:19.062
And no matter how badly I played,
how massively I screwed up,

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:23.769
I always knew when you waved back at
me, everything would be all right.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:29.144
I mean, I felt like the most special
person in the world when you did that.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:34.955
Until I'd look behind and six other women
were all waving back along with me.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.614
I was young then.
You know, I'm different now.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:40.421
Okay, so prove that to Lewis.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.530
He hates me, remember?
He doesn't hate you.

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:47.635
He just hates being disappointed,
and you've done that a lot, okay?

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:51.170
I mean, he was 4
when you left, remember?

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.501
You weren't even there
before that.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:58.635
It was easier when you were an absentee
daddy sending gifts, but now you're here.

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:02.340
And I'm sorry
if you take offense to this,

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:05.213
but you're a time bomb
with a charming accent

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.288
and when you explode, it's like:

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.023
You know, boom. Chaos.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:16.357
I hope you came back for him.
I really do.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:19.625
Nothing would make me happier.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.492
But if you came back for me,

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:26.801
you're wasting our time, and you're
gonna break his heart in the process.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.573
I gotta go.
All right.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.753
Hey, thanks for lunch.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.075
Hey, kiddo.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:18.890
So your mom was saying you were
thinking of quitting the team.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:25.427
I just want to say, I think that would be...
I think that would be a big mistake.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.934
What's the point?
I'm not good anyway.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.038
No, see, I don't agree with that.

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:33.640
You may have your mom's
looks and her smarts,

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:36.971
but you're a Dryer kid
and you play soccer.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.612
It's in your blood.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.612
I was thinking maybe we'd go
down to the park now

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.150
and get a practice session in
before the big game.

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.582
What do you say?

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:53.121
Okay.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.257
Dad, it's raining.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:01.129
It's just a sprinkle.
It'll be over before you know it.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.761
It's just typical.
What do you mean, "typical"?

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.930
Nothing ever works out
for our family.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:10.771
What are you talking about?
Plenty of stuff works out.

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:13.608
This is the best time
to learn how to play soccer.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:16.080
Because in the rain, like this,

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:19.777
if you can play in this,
you can play in anything, right?

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.154
There you go.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.338
Don't worry, Stace,
I'm sure they'll be fine.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:43.039
I'm just gonna see
if they're all right.

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:46.806
Want me to come? I can drive.
No. I'm fine.

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:53.377
All right, one, two.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:57.616
And you're gonna do this
one now. Like this.

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:59.989
- Okay.
- Okay? There you go.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.389
That's it.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.424
I think I finally got all of that mud
out of my ear.

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:37.360
What about you?

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:40.023
Lewis?

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.870
You had a big day.

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.105
Another good result, buddy, huh?
Yeah.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:55.271
A great goal
coming in from the left.

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:56.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:57.708
How was the game?

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:59.615
- Mom, I scored a goal.
- You did?

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.086
We won again.
Nice work, kiddo.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:05.055
How was last night?
Yeah, it was really good.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:07.255
Good.
Hey, Dad?

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.398
Me and Mom are going to
the arcade today. Wanna come?

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:14.091
No, I'm gonna let you guys go on with it.
Mom, can he come?

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.304
Well, yeah, I mean, you're
welcome to come if you want.

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:21.598
Okay.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.573
Yeah! Yeah!

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:30.741
You're playing like a baby.
You're hitting like a girl.

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:33.319
Young Dryer. Oh, oh! No.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:36.082
Oh. Oh...

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:39.755
Two shots? Accident.
Let's get rid of him.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.819
Oh, yes!
Whoo!

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:47.996
Hey, Mom, did you know that Dad
once took the ball off of Beckham?

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:50.103
Oh, yeah, I know,
actually. I was there.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:53.669
Wow. I wanna play like Beckham.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.901
Hey. What, you don't
want to play like me?

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.100
Yes!

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.612
God, it seems like
so long ago, doesn't it?

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.444
Yeah.

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:12.185
So the big day's coming up, huh?

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:15.022
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:18.028
Are you excited?
Yeah. Yeah, of course I am.

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:21.761
It's just crazy.

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:24.803
I just never thought
I'd be doing this again.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:30.808
Stacie's getting married.
Heh, heh.

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:37.979
Hey, Dad?
Yeah?

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.883
Can I have a sleepover
at your house again tonight?

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:45.318
It's not my night, buddy.
It's your mom's.

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:52.825
Yeah. Sure. Fine with me.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.333
You wanna see my room?

01:09:56.659 --> 01:10:00.630
Um, yeah. Yeah, of course
I want to see your room.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.909
It's not as big as my room
at home, but I like it.

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:11.382
Yeah. It is way cooler
than I thought.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.919
You know that's me, Mom.

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:16.819
Yeah, I know that's you.

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.754
You see this?
That? Who's that?

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:20.519
You.
Me?

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.026
- And me.
- You.

01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:23.357
Dad.

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:26.261
And Dad, huh?
You, me, and Dad.

01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:39.536
He okay?
Yeah. Fast asleep.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:45.216
Some wine?

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:48.583
Oh, no, no.
I should probably get going.

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:53.924
Fun day though, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:58.592
So who gets the teddy bear?
Ha-ha-ha.

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:07.104
Does he make you laugh, Stace?

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:11.105
Like really make you laugh?

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.574
Yeah.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.922
It's so weird,

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.320
but sometimes I just...

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:31.932
I look at you and it feels like
nothing ever changed.

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:35.329
Like we're still together.

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.333
I look at your face, and I...

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:46.906
I realize how lucky I was
to ever have you.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:51.643
And it kills me that I can't just
reach out and talk to you anymore.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:21.843
I... I can't. I can't do this.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:32.322
Stacie. Stacie,
hold on a second.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:35.987
Hey, hey. Stacie.

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:38.456
Hey.

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.559
You don't have to go.

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:26.035
Hey.
Hey, I thought you'd be home later.

01:13:26.202 --> 01:13:29.240
Uh, no, I grabbed an earlier flight.
Where were you?

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.085
I was just dropping Lewis off
at his dad's.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.046
Oh, it's not his night, is it?

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:38.590
No. But he wanted to go,
and I thought it was fine.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:39.783
Who's that?

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:41.792
My mom.
Last-minute invites.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:45.057
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:47.064
I'm fine.
You are?

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:48.429
You hungry?

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:05.074
Hey, Denise. What's up?

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.245
<i>I am. So you want some good news?</i>

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:10.584
I could certainly
do with some right now.

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:14.091
<i>Okay, good news coming at you
in three, two...</i>

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:24.332
I like the look, George.
Yeah?

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.565
So, what did you want to tell me?

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:30.301
Well, you gonna come closer?

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.175
No, no, no. The last time I came
closer I got myself in trouble.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:36.339
Which was just fine.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.021
ESPN liked your tape.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.151
They did?
Mm-hm.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.455
Liked as in liked?

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:52.360
They want to fly you up there
to see you personally.

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.001
ESPN? ESP-bloody-N?

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.369
You did it, George.
That's amazing.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.976
You're on your way.

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:06.443
Thank you so much.
Oh.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:13.810
All right. Okay, okay.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:19.016
I gotta get...
I gotta get back inside.

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:24.554
So that's all I get? That's it?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.896
I help you out,
you just leave me hanging?

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:32.063
I just can't.

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:37.809
I just can't do this anymore.

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.509
I gotta grow up.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:44.515
I got a boy in there who needs
me to start being a father.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.844
Well,

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.185
you have no idea
what you're missing.

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:55.090
I think I do, which is why
I gotta go back inside.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:56.855
All right.

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:01.392
That's it?

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.410
Lewis?

01:16:19.442 --> 01:16:21.183
Hey, buddy.

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:24.056
Hey.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.549
You okay?

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:29.460
Hey, what’s the matter?

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:32.360
You having a bad dream?
No.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.558
I just want to sleep in here.

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.225
Yeah?

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.094
Okay.

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:42.270
Yeah? Dad?

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.104
I love you.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.144
Come here.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.811
Please don't leave again.

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:21.978
Mr. Dryer?
Yeah, I'm George.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.778
I'm Ellen. I work with
Mr. Minton. You ready?

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.975
Yeah, I'm ready.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:29.021
All right. They're waiting
for you in the studio.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.952
Right this way.
Okay.

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:40.696
- Hey. George Dryer. How's it going?
- Good, nice to meet you.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:43.700
I heard you were coming.
I know you're gonna kill it.

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.634
Get out there
and make it happen.

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:48.138
Thank you, buddy.
I appreciate it.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:51.540
In Group E, Cameroon went down
2-1 to the Netherlands.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:56.672
The Dutch team are appearing as strong
contenders, taking 9 points out of 9,

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.979
and moving on past the group phase
to face Slovakia.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:03.186
Not moving on are the French...

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.854
The French.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:08.989
What happened to the French?

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:13.896
They came, they saw, they bitched,
they fought, half the management quit.

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:17.299
The rest of the team went on strike,
lost, and went home.

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:21.339
I may be giving the French a hard
time, but it does lead to a point.

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:25.639
Now I've been honored and lucky enough
to play for both club and country

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:28.680
and I can tell you
that to stand on a field

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:32.410
and score a goal in front of
50-, 70-, 100,000 fans,

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:37.183
to feel the ground shake
beneath you. It's unbeatable.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:41.192
And whether you're on that field
or whether you're part of that crowd,

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:45.025
there's no feeling like it,
and that to me is soccer.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:48.100
George Dryer,

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:49.600
welcome to ESPN.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.279
- Hello?
<i>- Oh, hey, Matt.</i>

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:07.682
I was looking for Stacie.
Is she there?

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:12.724
Oh, hey, George. No, she's actually... Went
to get fitted for her wedding dress.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:18.095
Okay, buddy. Thanks.

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:40.778
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm okay. I'll just be a minute.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.557
Hi.

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:51.425
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry. It's not cool.

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:53.965
It's not. You can't
come in here like this...

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.570
I know, I know. Stacie, the timings
always off with me. I mean...

01:19:57.726 --> 01:20:01.139
Is everything okay?
Yeah. It's fine. Just give us a minute.

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:07.570
I'm either too early, or I'm too late.
That's why I came.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.444
In a couple of weeks,
I'm gonna be too late again.

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:12.608
Stop, George, stop.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.350
Why are you doing this to me?

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:22.521
I'm moving to Connecticut.
I got that job.

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:28.360
You got the job?
I did, yeah.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:36.432
You know, and they gave me this book
on things to do in Connecticut.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:41.672
And I'm looking at the chapter on
family life and parks and schools

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.647
and I'm thinking,
what's the point?

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:50.348
What is the point if I don't have my family
with me, if I don't have you with me.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.826
Stacie,

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.667
I want you and Lewis
to come with me.

01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:03.526
No.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.697
I can't just pick up and go to Connecticut.
I can't, not with a 9-year-old.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:10.571
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
No. No.

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:16.479
I know that I haven't given you
any good reason to trust me.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:20.210
But I swear to God
everything's gonna be all right.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.857
I'm gonna make a life
for us there.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:28.861
God, I love you so much.

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:31.759
Oh, George, if you love me,

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.432
let me go.

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:38.494
Let me go.

01:22:02.885 --> 01:22:04.023
Excuse me?

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:07.099
I think the lady's
waiting for you outside.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:40.957
Oh, damn you, George.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:46.801
I know. I know, I know.
I meant everything I said.

01:22:53.602 --> 01:22:54.979
Please, don't touch me.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:58.016
Please don't. If I want to
be touched, I'll tell you.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.584
Okay, my hands are here.

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:02.449
This is on my pace.
This cannot be on your pace.

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:04.682
Okay, this is not all about you.
Okay.

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:06.952
Okay. On your pace.
Whatever you say.

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:09.095
Okay.
Okay.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:13.361
Why couldn't you have just
come back two months later?

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.996
Because my timing's
always bad. You know that.

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:46.524
That's a couple that can really talk.

01:23:48.624 --> 01:23:52.333
I really don't think
he's the groom.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:56.331
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.205
Mom, we should've left already.

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.847
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
Two minutes, okay?

01:24:01.003 --> 01:24:03.176
Hi.
Hey.

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:05.841
Buddy, let's go get your bag
and get ready.

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:08.488
We should probably
have been there already.

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:12.353
I know. I know.
Sorry. Okay.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:16.826
So do we have a wedding dress?
It zips. That's as much as I can tell you.

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:19.192
A bride to soccer mom
in two seconds.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.834
All right, beautiful.

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:32.674
Hey, coach. Looks like
we have a friend in common.

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:34.108
It's the accent.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:42.219
Hey, Dad.
Hey, champ.

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.383
You doing all right?
Yeah.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:49.051
I looked up my horoscope, and
it said "You're gonna be victorious."

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.094
Well, we should be okay, huh?

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.631
Hey, coach.
Hey. Hi, everybody.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:55.735
Hi. Hi, everybody.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.904
Hey, coach. Let's get
the show on the road.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.899
Okay, so it's the final game
of the season, okay?

01:25:04.066 --> 01:25:07.570
- If we win this, we win the championship.
- Yeah.

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:10.148
Yeah? And no matter
what happens today,

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.785
I want you to know
you've made me proud.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.979
But we're gonna get out there
and win this game, yeah?

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:17.714
Yeah!

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:21.053
Let's give it everything we've got
and get these wankers.

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:22.251
Yeah!

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.124
One, two, three...

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.731
Go, Cyclones!

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:27.323
Yeah!

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.080
Well done, Ally.

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:47.417
<i>Cyclones. Cyclones. Cyclones.</i>

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:52.689
Yeah!

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.256
Good job, Hunter.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:03.330
Don't let them play like this.

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:09.040
Don't worry about it.
Now we got a game on.

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.608
Now we can concentrate.

01:26:10.766 --> 01:26:13.269
All right, let's go. Keep it together.

01:26:13.435 --> 01:26:16.507
Go, go, go. Don't let them...

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.192
- Oh!
- Okay, not a problem.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.479
Let's move it forward.
Close them down.

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:23.486
Samantha, let's see
some playing, okay?

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:26.990
Just keep pushing forward.

01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:32.189
Come on, guys.
Let's talk to each other.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:33.958
Lewis, make a difference.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.699
Push it down the line.

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:40.033
Go, Lewis. Take the shot.

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:49.245
Come on, Lewis. That's it, go
ahead, take it to the goal.

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.974
There you go, Lewis.

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:54.878
Go, Lewis!

01:26:56.011 --> 01:26:59.049
Yes. Yes, Lewis.

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:01.894
Yes!

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:09.759
<i>Cyclones. Cyclones. Cyclones.</i>

01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:31.023
Two minutes, Cyclones.
Let's finish this off.

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:34.217
Hey, Carl.
I was wondering where you got to.

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:37.591
Let's push forward, Cyclones.
Come on.

01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:41.626
Hey, I got a little gift for you.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:45.237
Postcards from a great season.
That's thoughtful. Thank you.

01:27:45.393 --> 01:27:48.033
Open it up. Take a look.
No, after the game.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.733
Why don't you look at
it now, George?

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.940
Come on, folks. One minute left.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:28:01.577
Now that is my divorce
attorneys favorite.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:07.219
George, I thought I had mentioned that
I hire people to keep tabs on Patti.

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:10.920
That slipped your mind?
Buddy, you know what, I may be a shit.

01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:13.498
I'm a bigger shit
than even you dreamed of.

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:15.635
But you don't know me.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.998
I wouldn't sleep with your wife.

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:29.108
Go, go, go!

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:46.832
Dog pile!

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.602
Hey.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.176
It's not what it looks like.

01:29:39.574 --> 01:29:41.679
It never is.

01:29:43.645 --> 01:29:45.818
Good luck in Connecticut.

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.806
Hey.
Hey.

01:30:37.866 --> 01:30:42.542
So I thought I'd come
say goodbye.

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:45.979
Okay.

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.757
Well, good luck, George.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:56.660
Hey, Dad.

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.161
Hey.

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:04.268
I thought maybe you and I could take a walk.
What do you say? Yeah?

01:31:04.426 --> 01:31:05.996
Okay.

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:15.778
So I'm not gonna
see you anymore?

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:19.111
You're gonna see me.
Of course you're gonna see me.

01:31:19.274 --> 01:31:21.914
We're gonna have weekends.
I'm gonna come back

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:25.251
and you can come and
visit me in Connecticut.

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:33.094
Hey, I got something for you.

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:35.291
Remember this?

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:39.996
That’s the first medal
I ever won with Celtic.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:42.809
Yeah.

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:46.810
You're gonna win your own someday,
but you can keep that warm for me.

01:31:55.143 --> 01:31:59.819
I'll miss you, son.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Dad.

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:01.824
Come here.

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:14.505
We're gonna talk on the phone, okay?
Okay.

01:32:15.497 --> 01:32:19.536
You're gonna call.
And you're gonna write me.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.647
Okay.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:27.516
Okay.

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.348
Okay, I gotta go.

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.994
All right, buddy.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:05.054
He'll be okay.
Yeah.

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:21.230
Stace? Hey. Hey.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.906
Look, I'm not, uh, stupid.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:32.575
We've been together three years, so
I think that you owe me the truth.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.088
Do you still love him?

01:33:49.157 --> 01:33:51.797
I've never stopped loving him.

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.668
Dad.

01:35:40.435 --> 01:35:41.607
Hey.

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.942
What are you doing here?

01:35:47.008 --> 01:35:49.045
Well, I was on my way

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:53.784
and I suddenly thought what
if I wake up tomorrow morning

01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:57.555
and I want to take another walk
with you? You know?

01:35:57.719 --> 01:36:00.461
Yeah, but what about your job?

01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:05.193
Well, I don't have it all
worked out,

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.036
but I figure if I'm good enough for them,
gotta be good enough for someone here.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.746
You're really here to stay this time?

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.744
Yeah. I'm really here to stay.

01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:21.052
Come on.
Let's go play some soccer, all right?

01:36:21.209 --> 01:36:22.552
Okay.

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:26.217
All right, come on.
Come on, here you go.

01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:28.383
Oh-oh-oh. Oh!

01:36:32.587 --> 01:36:33.793
Whoa.

01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:43.602
Mom, Dad came home.

01:36:47.769 --> 01:36:49.112
You gave up the job?

01:36:51.606 --> 01:36:55.110
Someone very smart once told me
you just have to be there.

01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:59.488
I called off the wedding.

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:03.118
Why?

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:09.765
Because someone kind of stupid
got in my head.

01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:15.832
I can live with that.

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.703
Wanna play?

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:24.943
Yeah. Wanna play?
Yeah. I wanna play.

01:37:25.106 --> 01:37:27.950
Okay. Let's go.

01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:30.988
All right, Lewis. Come on.
Here you go.

01:38:01.743 --> 01:38:05.020
...and speaking of
time, we are out of it.

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:08.854
We'll see you tomorrow night
with the next George and Chip show.

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:13.192
Heh, heh. And he means
the Chip and George show.

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:17.530
I thought we agreed it sounded better if
we called it the George then Chip show?

01:38:17.692 --> 01:38:21.538
But that was before we had the logo.
Logo says Chip and George.

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:23.767
Yeah, the Chip
and George and Chip.
