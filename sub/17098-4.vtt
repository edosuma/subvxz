She, you know,
Korean style girl.

02:12.625 --> 02:13.959
What does that mean?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.166
There's a lot of Korean girls

02:15.208 --> 02:16.917
and a lot of Korean
girl styles.

02:16.959 --> 02:19.375
She dress too much like a...
What's the word...

02:19.417 --> 02:20.458
Slut.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.917
Did you just call
Nayoung a slut?

02:22.959 --> 02:24.875
No! I say she dress like slut.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.125
She wear very short skirt.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.500

02:34.542 --> 02:36.542
Make her short skirt
look even more short.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.083

based on her clothes.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.667

a woman dresses like that

Umma, Nayoung should be able
to dress however she chooses

02:47.458 --> 02:48.834
and not be judged.

02:48.875 --> 02:51.125
All I'm saying if she dressing
like that,

02:51.166 --> 02:52.417
she gonna get pregnancy.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.709
Short skirts don't make

It was funnier in my head.

03:32.417 --> 03:33.875
So what's happening?

03:33.917 --> 03:36.458

Are you okay?

18:35.917 --> 18:37.625
I got your text message.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.250
Um...

18:39.291 --> 18:40.875
Sad face, broken heart,

18:40.917 --> 18:43.458
waterfall, waterfall,
waterfall, rain cloud,

18:44.291 --> 18:45.750
and... Clapping monkey?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.667
So cute.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.291
I'm so sorry.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.375
About lunch with your friend.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.083
What? No!

18:55.125 --> 18:56.458
I'm the one who
should be sorry.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.834
I was out of line.

18:57.875 --> 18:58.959
Adeline?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.458
Oh! Out-of-line.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.291
There's an imaginary line

19:02.333 --> 19:05.458
and on this side
is nice people, and...

19:05.500 --> 19:07.667
Way over here, that's me.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.333
I just want to have
fun time together.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.417
I know.
It's just we're different.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.500
That's what I like.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.375
(LAUGHS) But sometimes,

19:18.417 --> 19:21.291
I forget that we
don't need to be the same
to be friends.

19:21.333 --> 19:24.375
(LAUGHS)<i> Eonni,</i>
I don't want to be like you!

19:25.166 --> 19:26.291
Right.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.667

19:30.709 --> 19:32.333
-What is?
-Open it.

19:36.417 --> 19:37.667
JANET: Pretty funny, eh?

19:37.709 --> 19:39.250
I love it,<i> Eonni.</i>

19:40.041 --> 19:41.792
I still wear that t-shirt.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.125
-I'm not surprised.
-(GIGGLING)

19:44.375 --> 19:45.750
You wanna take a photo?

19:46.458 --> 19:49.208
Take photo of us with photo.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.041
-Sure. (LAUGHS)

20:09.959 --> 20:11.709
KIMCHEE: Hope Terence is
enjoying himself at the game.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.875
We're not at.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.333
An unjust world.

20:15.667 --> 20:16.750
JANET: Hey...

20:17.166 --> 20:19.291
<i>-Ahn young ha sae yo!</i>

20:24.709 --> 20:26.000
So good to see you.

20:26.417 --> 20:28.291
Did you just come
from a comic book convention?

20:28.333 --> 20:30.750
-No.
-We come in search of beer.

20:31.417 --> 20:34.083
<i>-Eonni,</i> you so funny.
-(LAUGHING)

20:34.125 --> 20:35.333
Totally not joking.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.542
Is anyone gonna introduce us?

20:37.583 --> 20:39.458
Kimchee, this is our cousin,
Nayoung.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.834
So you can stop flexing.

20:40.875 --> 20:41.709
Nayoung, this is Kimchee.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:43.583 --> 20:44.917
You name is Kimchee?

20:45.291 --> 20:48.959
-It's because I'm hot.
-(LAUGHING) You are so funny.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.417
-That wasn't...
-I'll get you guys a drink.

20:53.792 --> 20:56.375
-Is, uh, she...
-Single?

20:56.417 --> 20:58.917
Yes. But sad for you,
she's also smart.

20:58.959 --> 21:02.959
Well, is she smart enough
to recognize the real deal
when it comes dancing on in?

21:03.208 --> 21:04.542
(MUSIC PLAYING)

21:04.583 --> 21:05.792
