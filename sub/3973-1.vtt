02:32.560 --> 02:33.607
Who is it?

02:35.960 --> 02:37.610
Um... Hi.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.126
My name is Quinn. I was looking for Elise.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.764
It's okay, Warren. Go upstairs.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.606
I'm Elise.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.489
Hi. Gosh,
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.206
Um... I got your name
from Claire Ortisky's mom.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.647
Mrs. Ortisky. Emily.
Sorry, Emily Ortisky.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.883
Um... Yeah, she told me
you worked as a psychic

03:04.960 --> 03:07.361
and that you were
really amazing when she saw you.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.488
I remember Emily.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.040
Yeah. She's awesome.
She's like, she's really nice.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.448
And she told me how great you were.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.487
She gave me a phone number for you,
but it wasn't working.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.291
So, you know, I...

03:21.360 --> 03:24.443
I'm really sorry
to have just shown up like this.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.291
It's okay.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.042
But if you're looking for a reading,

03:29.120 --> 03:31.043
unfortunately, I don't do those anymore.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.610
I have money. I brought like $50.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.648
No, no, no, no. It's not that, honey.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.205
I just can't, and I'm pretty busy, so...

03:38.320 --> 03:39.446
Okay.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.131
Where did you come from?

03:45.400 --> 03:46.561
Uh, Whealan Park.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.681
That's a long way.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.841
Yeah, it's no big deal though.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.480
I mean, I'm the one who just showed up.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.688
I'm really sorry that
I've wasted your time.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.368
Why don't you come in for a minute?

04:01.520 --> 04:04.729
Um... A good chat
is never time wasted, right?

04:11.120 --> 04:13.327
I love the style
of your house. It's so cool.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.204
Thank you. Have a seat.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.361
Thanks.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.004
You're a very smart girl, Quinn.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.920
Um, depends who you ask.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.246
No, you are. You read a lot.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.527
You have a lot of books
in that bag of yours.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.204
Yeah. Yeah. I love reading.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.887
What made you come
all the way here today?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.485
Um...

04:45.840 --> 04:49.970
I... I wanna talk
to someone who's not around anymore.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.561
Who?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.207
My mom.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.243
She died a year and a half ago.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.727
She had cancer.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.688
I mean, well,
first she had breast cancer

05:03.760 --> 05:04.966
and then she had a mastectomy,

05:05.040 --> 05:10.171
but it decided to
hang around and travel to her lungs.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.449
So, I guess you could say
it wanted to be with her

05:13.520 --> 05:15.124
just as much as
everyone else did.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.721
Well, tell me about her.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.561
I mean, she was great.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.449
Like, I mean, she could always hang
out with all of my friends.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.001
God, she loved old music,

05:29.080 --> 05:31.208
like vinyl records and stuff,

05:33.920 --> 05:35.809
and, um, she always
wanted to talk to me.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.721
Like, um...

05:45.840 --> 05:46.921
I'm sorry.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.448
No, no. That's okay.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.726
It's like, um...

05:58.600 --> 06:01.171
It's like sometimes I can
feel her around me.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.525
Like at night I'll be in my room,

06:04.600 --> 06:07.604
or, uh, I'll be sleeping
and something will wake me up.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.170
Or, you know, I'll find
things in weird places.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.447
Like I'll find my diary
somewhere strange.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.881
I don't know.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.047
I mean, I guess it's kind of crazy.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.281
Not to me, it isn't.

06:24.440 --> 06:29.241
You've tried to contact your mother
on your own, haven't you?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.403
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I've...

06:35.320 --> 06:36.765
I mean, I've asked her to talk to me

06:36.840 --> 06:38.490
but, you know, she never does.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.726
That's why I came here.

06:42.200 --> 06:46.250
You know?
I really need to ask her some questions.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.125
I know what that's like.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.728
All right.
You have to give me a moment,

07:03.800 --> 07:05.450
and I can't promise anything.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.765
Um... Here, please take
a little bit of money.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.968
No. I got out of this business.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.769
If I accept that from you,
I'm back in it.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.688
Normally,
we do this downstairs in my reading room.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.527
What's your mom's name?

07:26.800 --> 07:30.043
Lily. Lily Brenner.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.806
Lily Brenner.

07:47.960 --> 07:53.683
I'm calling out and trying to
make contact with Lily Brenner.

07:55.040 --> 07:59.090
Lily, if you can hear me,
please talk to me.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.566
Lily.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.126
Are you out there?

08:13.680 --> 08:15.648
- I can hear someone.
- Is it my mom?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.204
No, it isn't your mother.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.123
Go away.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.402
Go away. Go away.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.001
I'm sorry.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.327
I'm sorry.
There's a reason I had to stop doing this.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.881
There's other people that do this.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.803
You have to find one of them.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.724
You're gonna be okay, Quinn.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.000
But take my advice

09:19.480 --> 09:22.211
and do not try to
contact your mother on your own anymore.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.171
You have to be very careful.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.326
If you call out to one of the dead,

09:34.480 --> 09:36.323
all of them can hear you.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.091
Are... Are you there?

10:15.440 --> 10:16.521
Mom?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.080
Are you there?

11:11.760 --> 11:15.924
Today? No. Today?
No, I don't think so. No.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.047
Hey, you know what?

11:17.120 --> 11:20.647
What I mean is that
I can't be in two places at the same time.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.568
Yeah, the whole building
needs to be rewired.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.563
The original guys really screwed it.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.205
You know,
that's an entire extra day of work for me.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.645
You got that, right?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.047
Hang on, Bill.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.009
There's no food.
Didn't you go to the grocery?

11:35.080 --> 11:36.923
- Yeah, I did.
- Well, what did you get?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.764
I mean, what's this, "quinoa"?

11:38.840 --> 11:40.524
Quinoa.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.727
Uh-huh? Bill?
Yeah, of course, I'm gonna call the guy.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.240
I gotta get the part. Hang on, Bill.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.043
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a photo.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.929
- Why?
- Dad, it's for my blog.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.960
None of what you
just said to me makes any sense.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.126
It's not supposed to.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.282
Okay. Well,
how about don't blog it?

12:00.360 --> 12:01.566
Just eat it.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.481
That's a great t-shirt.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.561
You're weird. You're such a weird person.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.881
You know, nobody cares what
you're having for breakfast.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.531
Will you just go
get your brother ready for school, please?

12:14.840 --> 12:16.569
Alex. Alex!

12:16.640 --> 12:17.846
What?

12:18.080 --> 12:19.491
Come on. Get up.
Get ready for school.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.925
I am.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.888
God, it stinks in here.
Come on, get up.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.884
Okay, fine. I'll tell Dad.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.968
Jeez!
Can you hold on a second? I was getting...

12:30.040 --> 12:31.326
Just get out! Get out! Get out!

12:31.400 --> 12:32.561
Don't touch me!

12:59.400 --> 13:01.050
"I'll never forget this.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.245
"You'll go to the end of the world,

13:03.320 --> 13:04.810
"and you'll find me waiting there.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.566
"Your servant.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.280
"You'll always find me waiting there,
your servant."

13:17.240 --> 13:19.129
Okay. "I'll never forget this."

13:21.560 --> 13:24.245
All right, all right.
I am. I'm hurrying. Right. Bye.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.888
Why is it quiet? Quiet's not good.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.520
Alex, you see this face?
This is my "whoop-ass" face.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.449
When you see this face,
it means I'm about to whoop ass.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.648
Get ready. Come on.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.161
"You gave me life when I was dying.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.447
"And when I was leaving this world..."

13:42.520 --> 13:44.204
- Quinn!
- Jesus, you scared me!

13:44.280 --> 13:46.203
I need to rely on you
to get him up and going.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.248
- He's lying around like a corpse.
- No, I did.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.721
No, I need you to
get him ready for school.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.802
Dad, I have to learn my lines!
When am I gonna do that?

13:52.880 --> 13:54.962
I need your help here. I'm drowning.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.121
He's running late.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.851
You could have done this anytime.
You're being selfish.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.446
Yeah, I'm being really selfish
for worrying about my future?

14:02.080 --> 14:03.366
Just help me out.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.281
Come on.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.570
Oh-ho! Good timing, Hector.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.165
Now, you get to see Quinn.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.890
- Were you waiting there?
- Shut up.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.408
Uh... I wasn't, like, waiting.
I just like... I just came out.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.289
I know.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.044
So, uh, what have you got first?

14:26.120 --> 14:27.724
Uh, I'm not
going to school today.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.087
I have an audition
for a theater school in New York.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.201
Are you serious?
That's awesome. Wow.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.884
New York. It's far away.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.248
Quinn. You gotta see these birds.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.926
There's a flock of them at City Hall.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.971
But these ones are nicer,
but you can't eat them.

14:45.640 --> 14:49.565
Sorry, kids. Uh, sometimes she's
not sure about what she's saying.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.642
- I know her.
- Hmm...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.126
I know her.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.128
That's what you
have to look forward to when you get old.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.406
Yes. So do you.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.845
Yeah, but you'll get old first.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.204
Okay, I can't wait for this thing.
We're taking the stairs.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.850
- No!
- See you later, Hector.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.330
See you! Later.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.404
Mom, help me get through this.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.009
Quinn Brenner?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.202
- Hi there, Quinn.
- Yeah. Hi.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.283
Thank you for coming in.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.641
Thank you. Um, I'm so excited.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.404
I'm a huge fan of your school. I've...

16:08.480 --> 16:10.323
You know, it's always been
a dream of mine to go there.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.560
- I've always...
- Great.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.006
Have you prepared something for us?

16:13.080 --> 16:14.286
Yeah, I have.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.161
Whenever you're ready.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.165
"I won't ever forget this.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.924
"You will go to the end of the world

16:28.000 --> 16:30.048
"and you will find me waiting there.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.201
"Your servant."

16:35.120 --> 16:36.167
Um...

16:36.960 --> 16:38.689
It's okay. It's okay.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.000
You can start the scene again.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.609
Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry. I... I know it.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.640
Do you wanna take a break
and come back in a little bit?

16:50.920 --> 16:54.049
I hate him, and I don't mean
I pretend to hate him,

16:54.120 --> 16:55.406
like, "Really, I love you.
I'm just mad at you,"

16:55.480 --> 16:57.369
I actually literally hate him.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.922
Save the word
"literally" for when you're being literal.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.731
Shut up. God, don't ruin this.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.002
Look, we have a few months
of parental guidance left,

17:05.079 --> 17:08.209
and then this reality
we're currently living in is done.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.611
That's what's so great about it.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.284
You pick a college
on the opposite coast.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.885
He becomes a weekly phone call.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.611
That turns into a monthly phone call
when you need money.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.960
It's like he's not your dad anymore.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.769
He's just a bank you visit on Thanksgiving.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.968
Yeah, but I'm not
going anywhere, Maggie!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.280
I botched the audition

17:22.359 --> 17:24.010
to the one school I wanted to go to.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.805
I don't have a backup plan. It's over.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.731
Lord, you are so born
to be an actress, Brenner.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.881
"It's over!"

17:32.960 --> 17:33.961
No, I'm serious.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.723
That school is all that I wanted.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.490
And my dad wants me here
raising my brother.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.771
You're gonna be gone.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.080
You're gonna be okay.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.165
Yeah, everybody always says that.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.051
Hey. Come on.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.241
Ooh... Lesbifriends.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.242
Oh, no, you're right!

18:02.320 --> 18:04.322
Where's the nearest Jesus Camp?

18:04.640 --> 18:06.440
Have fun with your little boys.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.686
Good bye. Good bye.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.091
See you later, ladies.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.761
Let's get out of here.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.726
Come on, lesbo!

18:31.520 --> 18:33.045
Quinn! No! No!

18:36.800 --> 18:38.723
Someone help us, please!

18:39.320 --> 18:41.687
On my count. One, two, three!

18:49.120 --> 18:50.565
Get the crash cart here.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.806
Okay, get a new line in her.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.280
Monitor's showing V-tach.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.169
Okay, we got multiple
compound fractures on the right leg.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.961
BP is 163, dropping. Rate's degrading.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.840
Okay, give me one amp of epi.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.401
Paddles on 360.

19:14.160 --> 19:18.165
- Charge on 360!
- Do it! We got...

20:09.240 --> 20:11.766
Okay, we got her. We got her back.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.842
Let's keep her stable, folks.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.521
Mom?

20:25.600 --> 20:26.681
Hey, it's Dad.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.089
Honey, I'm here.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.484
Do you remember anything?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.209
I was with Maggie.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.441
And there was this man waving at me.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.922
He... He was at the theater, too.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.929
And then everything went dark.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.641
One second, hon.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.284
Mr. Sean. How are you doing?

21:24.360 --> 21:25.725
Hey, Harry.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.170
You know, we're really sorry

21:28.240 --> 21:30.208
to hear about
what happened to your daughter.

21:31.920 --> 21:35.641
Thanks, Harry.
She's here. That's what counts.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.688
The man who can't breathe.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.807
The man who lives in the vents.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.011
I heard him saying
your name last night.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.564
I heard him in your room
while you were gone.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.447
He's up there right now,

22:00.400 --> 22:03.449
standing in your room.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.285
You will see him.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.849
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

22:10.920 --> 22:12.729
Welcome home, bad ass.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.686
- Yay.
- Oh, my gosh, Quinn.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.569
Yeah, I'm all busted.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.602
Wheelchair's just
until the bones in her legs heal.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.808
Yeah. Thank God, huh? Thank God.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.008
Listen, I'm just happy
that you're gonna get better.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.411
Some people are crazy.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.600
The way they drive around
this neighborhood, you know?

22:29.800 --> 22:31.450
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.170
Yeah, it's, um, it's pretty embarrassing.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.203
- I sent some flowers.
- We got 'em.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.766
Hey, uh... Can I tag this thing or what?
Is that a cliché?

22:42.880 --> 22:44.450
No. Knock yourself out.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.080
Wow, you have
been saving that one.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.168
You just had to wait
for Quinn to get hit by a car.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.730
I think she's done
being shown off now.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.802
Listen, we just wanted
to see you, Quinn. Okay.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.530
Listen, anything you need.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.040
- Thanks, Ernesto.
- Well, I mean it.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.280
See you later.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.206
Home again home.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.801
All right, ready?

23:30.040 --> 23:31.883
One, two, three.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.484
Great neighbors we have, huh?

23:40.200 --> 23:41.770
Crazy cat lady on one side

23:41.840 --> 23:44.161
and a boy who's clearly
in love with you on the other.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.529
- He's not in love with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.841
You know, everyone that looks at me
isn't in love with me, Dad.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.763
Especially since I'm a cripple now.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.605
Hey. No sarcasm.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.282
Not since I got you
such an awesome gift basket.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.202
Huh? Everything you like. Books.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.922
Uh...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.765
Bell. In case you
want me to wait on you.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.004
- Some French food?
- French onion dip?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.201
<i>Oui?</i>

24:15.720 --> 24:18.405
Uh... Snacks.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.527
What?

24:20.440 --> 24:21.805
I'm vegetarian.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.962
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.686
When did that happen?

24:27.760 --> 24:28.886
It doesn't matter.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.402
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

24:34.880 --> 24:35.927
So, uh...

24:37.040 --> 24:39.646
Did any letters come from any schools?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.848
No, I don't want you
to worry about that right now.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.844
The only thing I want you
to think about right now is getting better.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.610
Understand?

24:46.680 --> 24:48.330
Think of it as a gift-wrapped excuse

24:48.400 --> 24:50.323
to do your favorite thing in the world.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.206
Sleep.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.641
Hey.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.324
You need me?
I thought I heard the bell.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.121
No, I'm fine.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.081
Good night, Warren.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.886
Good night, Jack.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.171
What the hell was that?

30:23.840 --> 30:25.330
I'm not making this up, Mel.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.640
It cracked my ceiling.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.171
I'm not saying you are.

30:29.520 --> 30:33.127
I'm just showing you that there's
nobody living above you right now.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.281
See?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.243
Yeah. Well, I heard it.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.770
And it came from that room.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.131
Mel, come look at this.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.006
What do you say now?
No one up here, huh?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.650
I don't know what to tell you.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.610
Tell me who's gonna
pay for the crack in my ceiling.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.205
Why can't I ever...

31:22.280 --> 31:24.362
Quinn, where's the frying pan, please?

31:24.440 --> 31:26.329
Third drawer in the far left.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.243
Yeah. I looked there already.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.041
You know what?
I can't take this right now.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.246
I'm too busy.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.049
Alex! No eggs this morning.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.561
Just find what you can in the fridge
for breakfast, okay?

31:35.960 --> 31:36.960
Whatever!

31:37.040 --> 31:38.929
Come on, Quinn. Eat your breakfast.

31:39.040 --> 31:40.121
I don't want to.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.645
You have to.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.131
I can't taste it.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.843
I can't taste anything anymore.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.326
Alex, are you dressed?

31:47.480 --> 31:48.641
Yes!

31:48.760 --> 31:50.171
I went to see a psychic.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.849
I wanted to talk to Mom.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.846
You what?

31:54.920 --> 31:57.605
I went and saw
a psychic woman named Elise.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.284
Claire's mom gave me her address.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.531
When was that?

32:01.600 --> 32:03.489
Like a month or so back.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.210
Strange things
have been happening.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.367
Like that knocking I heard last night,

32:09.440 --> 32:11.647
I think that was Mom
trying to reach me.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.846
Quinn.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.243
I don't want you to
get any funny ideas.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.890
You know, these nutcases are...

32:17.960 --> 32:19.166
They're paid to give you hope.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.526
That's what they do.
They make stuff up.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.126
Why couldn't that
have been her, though?

32:23.200 --> 32:25.009
What if she's trying
to tell me something?

32:25.080 --> 32:27.606
Why don't you ever
wanna talk about her or acknowledge her?

32:28.040 --> 32:29.201
I do talk about her.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.044
No, you don't! You just fight with me!

32:31.120 --> 32:33.726
You keep all this chaos
so you can pretend that she never existed.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.366
No, Quinn.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.731
I see her every single day

32:42.720 --> 32:44.210
when I look at you.

34:09.639 --> 34:12.882
Fine. I'll help her,
but you're staying here.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.210
I'm reaching out to Lilith Brenner.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.327
If you can hear me, please answer me.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.848
Your daughter may be in danger.
She needs your help.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.170
Please, Lily, answer me.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.728
I need to speak with you.

34:45.639 --> 34:49.531
Lily, please, show yourself.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.405
What do you want from her?

36:03.280 --> 36:04.850
I know you're not her mother.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.241
She thinks you are, but you aren't.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.570
And I'm not afraid of you.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.451
I know you're there.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.971
I've fought many like you
in my time, demon.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.686
Show yourself.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.485
I can't.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.284
I can't do this anymore.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.729
<i>Kate Wittier is still a bitch.
Mr. Paul is still hot.</i>

38:14.640 --> 38:17.962
<i>Hector is still asking about you
in a really unsubtle way,</i>

38:18.040 --> 38:20.407
<i>like, ugh, he just needs to stop.</i>

38:21.400 --> 38:24.131
<i>And everyone at school is
pretending that they care about prom</i>

38:24.200 --> 38:26.965
<i>and that they're going
to wear ironic costumes.</i>

38:27.360 --> 38:28.486
That sounds so fun.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.609
<i>No, it's not. It's the worst. Believe me.</i>

38:32.560 --> 38:35.325
<i>Oh, I wish someone
would run over my legs with a truck.</i>

38:39.400 --> 38:41.240
Wait. So, how's your
college application going?

38:41.280 --> 38:43.487
<i>No, we're gonna talk about you.</i>

38:43.560 --> 38:45.085
<i>How's it going with your dad?</i>

38:45.840 --> 38:47.922
He's taking all this time off work.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.684
He's out talking to his
boss about it right now.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.967
It's like this whole big situation.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.405
<i>That sucks.</i>

38:54.360 --> 38:56.089
<i>Well, uh, I don't know,</i>

38:56.160 --> 38:58.606
<i>what do you do
when you need to go to the bathroom?</i>

39:01.760 --> 39:06.527
<i>No! No.
No way. You're kidding me!</i>

39:07.440 --> 39:09.568
<i>- Hey, is that Alex?</i>
- What?

39:10.080 --> 39:11.366
<i>Standing right next to you.</i>

39:14.280 --> 39:15.805
What are you talking about?

39:15.880 --> 39:18.008
<i>Um... Alex. He's right...</i>

39:19.120 --> 39:20.201
Maggie?

39:24.600 --> 39:25.965
Maggie?

41:32.400 --> 41:33.481
Quinn!

41:36.960 --> 41:38.803
What's happening? Quinn!

41:38.880 --> 41:40.609
Are you hurt?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

41:40.680 --> 41:42.330
My neck!

41:42.400 --> 41:43.526
Someone's in here.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.761
There's someone in here?

41:47.800 --> 41:49.609
I'm here now. It's okay.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.566
Ow.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.687
Careful.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.685
This will prevent her
from moving in a way

41:57.760 --> 41:59.160
that could injure her neck further.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.126
- Ow.
- Easy.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.601
Just hold still.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.641
Thank you.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.800
Quinn, what happened?

42:18.280 --> 42:20.009
I was thrown out of bed.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.326
But there was no one in your room.
I would've seen them.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.604
It wasn't a person.

42:28.840 --> 42:29.887
It was...

42:32.800 --> 42:35.849
Before I thought
that it was Mom trying to contact me.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.566
But it's not. It's something else.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.241
Are you sure it wasn't just a bad dream?

42:45.320 --> 42:47.527
No! I saw him.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.444
He had on a mask.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.923
He had on a breathing mask.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.486
I believe you.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.648
I do. You're gonna be okay now.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.801
Get some rest out here.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.283
I think we got
everything we need.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.762
Come on. Thank you very much.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.561
Harry?

43:35.360 --> 43:36.361
She's gone.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.125
She just wouldn't wake up.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.407
Oh, Harry, I'm sorry.

43:45.800 --> 43:50.886
People called her the "cat lady,"
"crazy lady," but she wasn't any of that.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.810
She was somebody.
She meant something. She was my wife.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.085
We were together 52 years.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.721
She had a whole life before she got sick.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.326
She was beautiful.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.607
So, so beautiful.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.162
The most beautiful girl in the whole town.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.322
I knew she didn't have long,

44:19.400 --> 44:22.244
and I tried my best
to tell her what she meant to me.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.010
The sad part is

44:26.440 --> 44:29.046
I don't think she
understood a word I was trying to say.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.644
She knew what you said.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.883
She knows how much you love her.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.209
Harry, if you ever need anything,

44:39.320 --> 44:42.847
anything, just tell me, okay?

44:45.440 --> 44:46.680
Thanks.

46:45.800 --> 46:49.691
Help. Help!

46:49.760 --> 46:53.765
Help! Help!

47:02.720 --> 47:03.846
Dad.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.811
Dad! Help!

47:37.280 --> 47:38.770
Help!

47:44.760 --> 47:46.250
Help!

47:47.360 --> 47:49.328
Dad! Dad, help me!

47:50.280 --> 47:51.441
- Dad!
- Quinn!

47:57.960 --> 47:59.530
What are you doing up here?

48:03.880 --> 48:05.609
Dad, I told you.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.125
Jesus, he jumped.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.645
- Quinn!
- Dad!

49:27.280 --> 49:28.566
Dad, help! Help!

49:33.960 --> 49:35.121
Quinn. Quinn.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.721
- Who's there?
- It's Sean Brenner.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.930
I'm Quinn's father.

49:58.840 --> 50:01.650
I told her I don't really
give readings anymore.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.047
Believe me, I wanna help,

50:04.120 --> 50:06.168
but this ability I have
to contact the other side,

50:06.240 --> 50:08.925
I promised myself
I wouldn't do it anymore.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.728
Look, I don't know
anything about this stuff.

50:13.400 --> 50:15.926
I don't know what's real, what's not.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.809
I only know her, she's real.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.641
She's my daughter,
and something's trying to kill her,

50:20.720 --> 50:22.768
and I don't know
what to do to stop it.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.765
I can't let that happen again,
not after my wife.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.408
She told me that you lost your wife.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.051
I'm so sorry.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.364
Loving someone
is just delayed pain, isn't it?

50:46.960 --> 50:49.120
Eventually you're gonna lose them
one way or the other.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.322
I lost my husband a year ago.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.811
He took his own life.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.644
So, I couldn't even blame fate.

51:07.160 --> 51:12.007
He'd suffered depression before,
but I never thought that...

51:14.000 --> 51:16.844
There are so many things
I needed to say to him.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.005
Goodbye would've been nice.

51:28.160 --> 51:31.846
So, I tried to contact him.
I just couldn't help it.

51:41.200 --> 51:46.081
There are two worlds
that exist beyond ours, Mr. Brenner.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.329
Think of them as light and dark.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.725
I visited the dark, looking for him,

51:56.840 --> 51:58.604
something I'd never done before.

52:04.200 --> 52:07.044
Something we living people
are not supposed to do.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.567
But someone followed me back.

52:13.120 --> 52:17.444
A woman, an entity driven by evil.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.164
Ever since then,
whenever I use my ability, this woman,

52:25.400 --> 52:27.209
I could hear her in my head,

52:27.280 --> 52:32.241
screaming over and over
that she's going to kill me.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.001
I think...

52:39.000 --> 52:44.370
No, I know if I continue
with this work,

52:44.440 --> 52:45.680
she's going to kill me.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.929
Then just visit Quinn.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.804
It's all I ask.
You don't have to do anything else.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.041
Just talk to her.

53:00.920 --> 53:01.967
Thank you.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.930
We're gonna be okay.

53:30.680 --> 53:31.761
Quinn?

53:33.800 --> 53:35.006
Elise.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.481
You came.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.807
Lucky you look good in white.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.644
What's happening to me?

53:48.280 --> 53:50.408
One night after you came to see me,

53:54.120 --> 53:55.246
I had a vision of you.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.049
You were standing in the dark.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.128
A man was walking toward you.

54:01.840 --> 54:03.763
A man who couldn't breathe.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.123
I've been to that dark place, too.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.687
It's not a place for pure souls.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.121
It is very dangerous.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.450
When you go there,

54:19.360 --> 54:21.362
things come back with you.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.323
I don't wanna die, Elise.

54:28.200 --> 54:30.043
You have a long life ahead of you.

54:33.160 --> 54:34.525
I cross my heart.

54:37.400 --> 54:40.051
I'm here with Quinn Brenner.

54:42.040 --> 54:45.362
I want to speak to the entity
that has attached itself to her.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.771
Can you hear me?

54:55.400 --> 54:56.606
Are you there?

56:33.400 --> 56:35.050
Where is the man who can't breathe?

56:35.160 --> 56:36.889
I wasn't trying to upset him.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.690
Get away from me! Get away!

57:37.880 --> 57:40.247
I'm not going any further.

59:17.960 --> 59:23.251
<i>I always wanted to know how I would go</i>

59:23.320 --> 59:28.690
<i>Tell me, friend, how I meet my end</i>

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.921
No!

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.681
Elise!

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.521
Elise. Elise.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.767
Elise! Wake up! Elise!

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.249
Wake up! Elise!

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:48.246
The woman that wants to kill me
was waiting for me.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.641
I'm sorry. I can't. I can't help you.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.563
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.888
I'm telling you, Dad.
These guys can help.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.171
<i>Throughout this hospital over the years,</i>

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.800
<i>a lot of paranormal experts
have come in here and then the, uh...</i>

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.444
I don't know. They look like fools.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.650
They found a house
that was being haunted,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.882
and they cleaned it. Trust me.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.647
I don't.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.602
Dad, we have to do something.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.841
I'm Sean, Quinn's dad.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.046
Hey. Specs.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.248
- Tucker.
- This is Alex.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.889
Yeah, he's a big fan of your website.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.962
- Web series.
- Web series.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.760
I showed him
that one where you guys

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.006
get the ghost out
of that one hotel.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.969
- The boiler room ghost?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.088
- That was a good one.
- Yeah. Thanks, little man.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.730
Some of my best editing on that one.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.240
Definitely some of our best editing.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.682
So, do you guys do this kind of thing often?
This ghost hunting?

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.046
All the time.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.169
Yeah. It's actually all we do.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.722
We literally don't
do anything else. Just this.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.321
So what happens now?

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.565
Probably five, maybe four.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.561
Excuse me?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.846
And I have to call you back.
I'm just with some peeps.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.160
Roger that.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.011
Come on. She's in here.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.721
Thank you. Pass the trash.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.841
Here you go.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.806
Thanks.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.161
Excuse me.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.609
Now, this
custom-made camera of mine

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.250
is outfitted with a small lens.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.723
Basically a hidden camera.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.848
It's not basic and it's not hidden.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.650
'Cause we're keeping it
right out in the open

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.609
to capture whatever
may occur tonight.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.330
We do hide it though, sometimes.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.361
Thanks.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.041
This is our sound backup.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.642
Any noises will be
recorded right here.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.448
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.682
You just go to sleep
like you normally would.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.124
We are
the ones who stay awake.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.166
Hello, Elise.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.891
It's been too long.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.322
I save you for special occasions.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.287
That's her.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.046
She says one day, eventually,

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.804
I'm going to die by her hand,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.086
and I believe her.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.642
That's why I had to stop using my gift.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.244
But now I'm realizing

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.925
my gift is all I have.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.764
It's all I am.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.206
First of all, okay,
you are more than one thing.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.008
And, second,
you've been helping people

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.128
get rid of these spirits for so long.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.762
Well, eventually,
one of them was gonna come after you.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.650
You can't be afraid of her.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.968
All right, you're stronger than her.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.290
You're alive.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.771
Yes, I'm alive.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.088
But I have spent more time on this earth

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.083
among the dead than the living.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.931
Do you really think we help people, Carl?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.365
We do what we can.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.208
If someone gets attacked
by a person on the street,

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.567
they can go to the police.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.564
If they're attacked
by something they can't see,

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.881
something they can't comprehend,

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.201
they only have people like us to go to.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.327
Here.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.288
Look at what you did for that family.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.207
You saved them.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.169
That boy is a grown man now
with a son of his own.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.163
I don't want you to stop
helping families like them.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.004
They need you too much.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.600
What's that?

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.011
I don't know.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.486
She's up.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.371
What? No. No.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.169
She can't be doing that.
That's impossible.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.924
Well, she's doing it.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.088
Go. Go!

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.521
She's gone. Come on. Look.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.891
I gotta go get her.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.968
Yeah. Good idea. You should.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.647
Quinn?

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.201
Quinn?

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.881
Where are you, honey?

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.521
Wait.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.810
Here. Keep the flashlight on the closet.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.086
Yeah.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.486
She took it off.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.087
Quinn.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.201
Wait.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.206
You're a useless fucking father.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.282
Your wife had to die
to get away from you.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.361
No.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.647
And now I'd rather be dead, too,

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.566
but I'm gonna keep you alive
to watch you suffer.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.083
I'll be waiting in the dark
when the pain finally kills you.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.565
No! No!

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.324
Don't!

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.961
Quinn!

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.245
No! No!

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.721
Hand me that wire!

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.929
Okay! Okay.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.321
What do we do now?

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.370
I don't know.
We are not qualified for this.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.090
We sit in dark empty rooms.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.161
This is way out of our league!

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.241
What do you mean?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.368
Are you telling me
you have no idea how to help us?

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.081
No.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.207
Are you saying that

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.049
you're a couple of
goddamn Internet pranksters?

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.724
I let you in my house, you...

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.444
Dad! Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.567
This isn't going to help Quinn!

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.641
Get out! Get out of my house!

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.721
Get out!

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.970
Let them stay.
We may need them.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.644
What? What for?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.209
To help me get rid of the foul parasite

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.362
that's attached itself to your daughter.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.526
I need you to stay
at Ernesto's tonight, buddy.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.284
- But I wanna be here.
- I know.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.522
I'm not leaving, Dad.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.370
Alex, we know you love her.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.123
But you do not wanna see the things
that tonight may show you.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.605
She's gonna feel your love.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.440
Good night, buddy.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.641
Now what?

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.406
This entity is very powerful.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.563
It's a spirit who used to
live in this building a long time ago.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.569
It's been alone for a long time.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.764
But she's making it stronger.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.800
It's feeding on her life force.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.925
And wants to possess her?

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.645
Usually, entities of this type,
living in the dark,

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.530
they want to possess
the bodies of the living

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.809
so that they can
leave the dark and return to life.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.927
But there's another kind of a spirit.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.765
It's an even worse kind.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.046
One that does not wanna leave the dark,

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.446
that wants the souls of the living
to join it in the shadows.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.169
She's only half a person right now.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.126
After the accident, it got half her soul.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.491
It needs all of it.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.601
And if we don't hurry,
it's going to get it.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.682
Okay, what do we do now?

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.524
To bring all of your daughter back,

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.648
I'm going to have to go to where it lives.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.888
You can record everything,
even in the dark?

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.247
Yeah, of course. Whatever you need.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.163
I'm the technical part of the team.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.484
Then you better get set up.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.926
What's your contribution?

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.771
Yeah, this should be good.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.286
It's not good, it's great. It's our blog.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.327
I'm the writer of it.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.803
Okay, then, you write down
everything I describe when I'm under.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.649
If you can keep up, that is.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.407
Now, I'm going into another plane.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.526
"Into another plane."

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.600
Stay strong.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.367
No matter what happens,
no matter what you see.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.602
"No matter what..."

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.527
Okay, could you just
maybe write it down and try not to talk?

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:10.960
Um... Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.806
Uh... Sorry. Does this
other plane have a name?

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.969
Let's call it "The Further."

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.689
- Cool name.
- Now, we're going to be quiet.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.401
Into The Further, we go.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.531
I'm here. It's dark.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.928
I'm entering the hallway.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.042
You lived in this building, too?

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.764
He made you kill yourself, didn't he?
Where is he?

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.241
Show me.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.523
We're going upstairs.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.923
His voice was always in my head.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.285
I was his pet.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.842
He's got a new pet. The girl.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.882
Quinn is his new pet.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.961
There's no undoing.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.086
You can't even kill yourself
to get away from it.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.046
It's okay. You're free now.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:16.202
I can hear it breathing.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.167
I hear it.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.406
Turn around.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.444
You're stronger than her. You're alive.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.969
This is how you die.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.042
Not today, it isn't.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.846
Come on, bitch.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.841
Let her go.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.601
Do you hear me? Release the girl!

01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.680
Jack?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.966
Hi, Ellie.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.241
Come.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.326
Sit here with me.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.481
What are you doing here?

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.568
Well, I could feel you were here.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.204
I had to find you.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.362
Oh, I've missed you so much.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.285
I know. I know.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.041
Oh...

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.250
How am I...
How am I supposed to move on?

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.483
I never even got to say goodbye.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.489
Well, maybe you can move on.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.450
I can't exist anywhere without you.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.040
So, I wanted
to ask you to join me here.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.207
You'd have to leave
your other world behind.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.762
Stop breathing in it, like I did.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.405
Stay with me here.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.649
You'll have to do it yourself.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.286
I can't help you.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.644
Don't you want to be with me?

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.646
Want.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.123
"Want" is not a strong enough word.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.684
I know my turn to cross over will come.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.651
But I know that my Jack
would never ask me to do this.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.241
Demon.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.886
Give me the girl now
or I'll do a whole lot worse!

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.881
Give her back.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.770
You may have half of her,
but I am whole,

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.608
and I am very strong.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.927
Oh!

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.686
Go! Go, go!

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.729
Elise, wake up! Elise!

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.361
Elise!

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.684
This way. This way.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.726
- Quinn?
- Honey?

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.080
- Quinn!
- Honey, please.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.762
- What's happening to her?
- It's got her.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.729
Wake up. Don't let it take you.
Grab her hands!

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.365
Quinn, don't leave! Don't leave!

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.247
Stay with us!

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.046
This world is your home!

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.963
Not that one! This one!

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.080
What's happening? Is she dying?

01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.321
Just hold on to her.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.845
- Is she?
- Yes.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.922
No! No! Bring her back!
Bring her back!

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.929
You said you could
bring her back!

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.441
- You need to help me. Quinn!
- What?

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.522
- Quinn, Quinn, hear us!
- Quinn.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.204
- Come back to us!
- Quinn!

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.481
What are you doing?

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.811
There's another woman here
who died in this building a few days ago.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.008
Yeah. Grace.
Grace, the neighbor's wife.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.482
She's saying something to me.
I can't hear it exactly.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.000
- What is she saying?
- Honey, please!

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.451
What book?
Grace, what book?

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.681
Hurry!

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.091
Hurry! Elise, hurry!

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.327
Quinn's diary.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.401
This is it. "Quinn, I wanted you to find
this on the day you graduated."

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.046
This is the letter
that Lily hid from Quinn.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.726
She wanted her to find it
on her graduation day.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.609
She tried to get
her to read it early.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.682
She was trying to reach Quinn.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.046
Quinn!

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.884
Lily, I know you were
trying to reach her.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.611
We know that you wanted her
to read this letter.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.922
Lily, we need you now!

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.441
Help us.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.527
Dad.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.085
Thank you.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.491
We had some help.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.841
Who?

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.844
Someone else is here with us.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.650
Someone who really wants to talk to you.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.801
Mom.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.726
I need to know that this is real.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.040
Okay.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.731
She's saying something
about a stage, an audition.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.125
She says that when
you were on stage,

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.362
you wanted to know
if she was there.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.925
She was there.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.481
<i>And she was so proud of you.</i>

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.847
She wants you, and you, Sean,

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.605
to know that you
don't need to look for her anymore.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.082
Because she'll always be with you.
No matter what.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.006
She's gonna be standing
right beside you.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.327
And even though
you can't see her, she's there.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:37.528
And anytime you're feeling
confused or alone,

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.041
she's gonna be
whispering in your ear.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.684
She's never coming back again, is she?

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.730
Not to this world.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.561
I love you.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.606
Good job, boys.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.966
Careful.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.921
Thanks.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.967
Is that the first time
you've seen a ghost?

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.565
- Well...
- Yes.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.970
You never get used to it.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.284
Spectral Sightings, I like that.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.486
That one's mine.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.686
Is it?

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.604
Stop. You boys fight too much.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.650
It's unnecessary.
It's clear you both need each other.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.568
Maybe we should go
into business together?

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.971
I thought you said
this business was too dangerous for you

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.122
and you said it could kill you.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.689
Yeah. Well, everybody's
gonna die one day.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.328
I think it is high time

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.324
for me to get out
of my house while I'm still alive.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.081
What do you think?

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.521
Yes?

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.965
- Yeah.
- Sure.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.247
Well then, take me to my car.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.121
- Oh...
- That's great.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.646
I also think
that you guys should think

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.370
about wearing something
a little better,

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.522
if we're gonna be working together.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.523
I'll have you know
this tee is extremely rare.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.125
Well, I'm sure it is.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.804
So, you should apologize.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.245
I apologize.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.125
What would you
have us wear instead?

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.283
Mmm...
Shirt and tie might be nice.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.961
Ain't gonna happen.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.809
Warren, you old dog.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.563
Thank you for looking after me.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.961
Where is the...

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.004
Oh...
