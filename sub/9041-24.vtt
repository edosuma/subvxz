04:59.267 --> 05:00.433
WELL, YOU HEARD ME.
I CAN'T GO.

DEBRA WANTS

05:01.600 --> 05:03.233
AND, OH--
WHERE DO I BUY CANDLES?

05:03.233 --> 05:05.533
SHE WANTS A CANDLE

05:15.867 --> 05:18.867
YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T--YOU KNOW.

05:18.867 --> 05:20.900
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RUSH
THE PHYSICAL PART,

05:20.900 --> 05:22.133
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.367
- HEY, SHE WANTS A CANDLE?

05:23.367 --> 05:26.367
IT'S EITHER SEX,
OR YOU SMELL.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.700

WITH RAY TOMORROW NIGHT?

05:34.733 --> 05:36.267
- HMM, I DON'T KNOW.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.800
HAS THE PRESIDENT DECLARED RAY
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.800
[laughs]

05:40.800 --> 05:43.333
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE, ALL RIGHT?

05:43.333 --> 05:45.133
IF THE PRESIDENT
WAS AROUND TO DECLARE IT,

05:45.133 --> 05:47.267
THEN HOW AM I THE LAST MAN,
STUPID?

05:47.267 --> 05:49.000
- WELL, PRESIDENT
OR NO PRESIDENT,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.067
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE EVER
HAVING SEX WITH THAT DEBRA.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.233
- LOOK, RAY, IT'S SIMPLE.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.200
WHEN YOU GET OVER THERE
TOMORROW, LOOK FOR SIGNS.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.700
SEE IF SHE SHAVES HER LEGS,
AND YOU'RE IN.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.433
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO?

06:00.433 --> 06:02.733
ASK HER IF SHE LIKES MADONNA.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.833
NOW, I ALWAYS ASK THAT,
'CAUSE IF SHE DOES,

06:04.833 --> 06:07.000
THAT MEANS SHE'S GOT
A LITTLE BIT OF A WILD SIDE.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.267
- OH, STOP.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.867
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH A WILD SIDE?

06:09.867 --> 06:11.733
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.067
- HEY, I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU HERE.

06:13.067 --> 06:14.133
- YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING, MAN.

06:14.133 --> 06:15.767

06:15.767 --> 06:19.033
CHECK HER EGGS!

06:19.033 --> 06:20.300
- WHAT?

06:20.300 --> 06:21.967
- YOU CHECK HER REFRIGERATOR

06:21.967 --> 06:23.400
TO SEE IF SHE HAS ENOUGH EGGS

06:23.400 --> 06:28.400
TO MAKE BOTH OF YOU
BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING.

06:29.733 --> 06:30.933
- OH, REALLY?

06:33.167 --> 06:34.400
[all groaning]

06:34.400 --> 06:36.100
- DEAR GOD.
- WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

06:36.100 --> 06:39.300
- I'M JUST SAYING.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.900
I'M JUST SAYING.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.333
WHEN DEBRA'S READY,
SHE'LL LET ME KNOW.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.967
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU SIT
BY THE MAILBOX

06:44.967 --> 06:47.767
AND WAIT FOR THAT LETTER?

06:47.767 --> 06:49.633
- YEAH, WE'LL SWING BY

07:23.000 --> 07:24.467
LET ME PUT IT

07:24.467 --> 07:26.233
- OKAY.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.433
LISTEN.
I RENTED "OUT OF AFRICA."

07:28.433 --> 07:29.500
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.867
IT'S KIND OF A GIRLY FILM.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.933
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

07:51.533 --> 07:53.267
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED IT?
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.867

08:08.867 --> 08:10.300
IT'S CALLED
"MORNING MIST,"

08:10.300 --> 08:12.733
BUT THE LADY SAID
YOU COULD LIGHT IT AT NIGHT.

08:15.933 --> 08:22.067

I DON'T SEE THAT.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.067

08:51.233 --> 08:53.267

YOU KNOW,
I DON'T COOK A LOT,

09:45.833 --> 09:48.367
BUT YOU'RE REALLY
STARTING TO INSPIRE ME.

09:48.367 --> 09:51.067
- I BET YOU'RE A NATURAL.
- OH.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.367
[doorbell rings]

09:52.367 --> 09:54.167
- OH, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THE FOOD, MA,

09:54.167 --> 09:55.967
SO YOU PROBABLY
SHOULD SKEDADDLE.

09:55.967 --> 09:58.300
- LET'S EAT!

09:58.300 --> 09:59.667
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

09:59.667 --> 10:00.800
I FOUND A BROKEN METER.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.867
WE'VE GOT ALL NIGHT.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.733
WHERE'S THE LASAGNA?

10:04.733 --> 10:05.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:05.767 --> 10:06.767
I WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING

10:06.767 --> 10:07.800
ALL THIS COMPANY.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.433
- SHE'S RIGHT.
GET OUT.

10:10.433 --> 10:11.700
- NO, NO, RAY,
BUT I THINK

10:11.700 --> 10:13.233
I HAVE A FOLDING TABLE
IN THE BACK,

10:13.233 --> 10:14.467
SO I'LL JUST GET IT.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.233
- GREAT!
I'LL PUT ON THE YANKEES.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.467
- NO, NO, LISTEN, YOU GUYS.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.333
YOU BOTH GOT TO GO HOME, OKAY?

10:19.333 --> 10:20.600
DEBRA AND I--WE'RE HERE.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.700
WE'RE TRYING
TO WATCH A MOVIE.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.433
- YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE,
YOUNG MAN.

10:25.433 --> 10:26.800
- WHAT?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.100
- YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW

10:28.100 --> 10:30.033
WHAT'S GONNA
TAKE PLACE HERE TONIGHT?

10:30.033 --> 10:32.567
YOU OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.933
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU AND DEBRA ARE PLANNING

10:42.933 --> 10:44.067
FOR TONIGHT, RAYMOND.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.200
- WHAT?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.667
HOW DO YOU KNOW...
ANYTHING?

10:47.667 --> 10:49.600
- BELIEVE ME.
I WOULD RATHER NOT KNOW.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.633
BUT WHEN YOU TALK
IN YOUR ROOM,

10:51.633 --> 10:55.267
IT CARRIES
THROUGH THE WHOLE HOUSE.

10:55.267 --> 10:57.300
- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR MOTHER
STANDS ON THE DRESSER

10:57.300 --> 11:00.067
SO SHE CAN LISTEN
THROUGH THE VENT.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.267
- OH, MY GOD!
MOM!

11:04.267 --> 11:05.467
YOU TWO
HAVE TO LEAVE, OKAY?

11:05.467 --> 11:07.367
DEBRA AND I
WOULD LIKE TO BE ALONE.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.333
- OH, HELLO, RAYMOND.

11:15.333 --> 11:19.300
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.100
- OH, FATHER HUBLEY,
COME IN.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.767
- THANKS FOR THE RIDE, ROBERT.

11:22.767 --> 11:25.967
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS LASAGNA ALL DAY.

11:25.967 --> 11:28.567
- HI.

11:28.567 --> 11:31.500
- OH, DEBRA,
THIS IS OUR FAMILY PRIEST,

11:31.500 --> 11:32.567
FATHER HUBLEY.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.200
AND IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU,

11:34.200 --> 11:35.800
HE'S GONNA JOIN US FOR DINNER.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.500
- HELLO.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.100
- WHY DON'T WE ALL SIT DOWN

11:39.100 --> 11:40.867
AND GET TO KNOW
ONE ANOTHER?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.233
COME ON, SWEETIE.
- OKAY.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.167
- YES, COME ON, SWEETIE.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.433
OH, IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.233
- OH, FATHER,
PLEASE SIT.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.000
- PLEASE, FATHER.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.067
- FATHER HUBLEY,

11:59.067 --> 12:00.600
DID YOU KNOW
THAT DEBRA AND RAYMOND

12:00.600 --> 12:02.667
HAVE BEEN DATING
FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW?

12:02.667 --> 12:04.667
- MA, YOU KNOW SOMETHING--
MAYBE THIS IS A BAD TIME,

12:04.667 --> 12:06.833
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE ENOUGH LASAGNA HERE.

12:06.833 --> 12:07.867
- HEY, RAY'S RIGHT.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.633
WE MAY BE IN TROUBLE HERE,

12:09.633 --> 12:12.200
BECAUSE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
FATHER,

12:12.200 --> 12:13.800
I SAW WHAT YOU DID
TO THAT CHEESECAKE

12:13.800 --> 12:16.233
AT THE CHURCH BAKE SALE.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.700
- FATHER HUBLEY,

12:24.700 --> 12:27.333
I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION
ON THE COMMANDMENTS.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.000
DO YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
OR CAN YOU JUST
PICK AND CHOOSE?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.133
[both whispering]

12:35.300 --> 12:38.400
- RAY!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:38.400 --> 12:39.900
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S THE MATTER.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.500
MY MOTHER IS TRYING TO PREVENT
YOU AND ME FROM HAVING--

12:43.500 --> 12:45.633
CHINESE FOOD!

12:48.933 --> 12:51.167
- OH, YOU GOT CHINESE COMING.

12:51.167 --> 12:53.267
WE'RE GOOD, FATHER.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.733
- OH, FRANK, WOULD YOU
STOP THINKING ABOUT FOOD

12:55.733 --> 12:57.000
FOR A SECOND?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.800
YOUR SON'S MORAL HEALTH
IS IN JEOPARDY.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.900
- WHAT?

12:59.900 --> 13:01.567
- OH, FOR CRYING
OUT LOUD, MARIE.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.733
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
FIT HER FOR A CHASTITY BELT

13:03.733 --> 13:06.400
AND BE DONE WITH IT?

13:09.100 --> 13:11.400
- OH, MY GOD.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.000
IS--IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE ALL HERE?

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
BECAUSE OF SEX?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.767
- I WAS ONLY TOLD
ABOUT THE LASAGNA.

13:35.967 --> 13:37.767
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.167
- WELL, IF I MAY, DEBRA,

13:40.167 --> 13:41.767
THE WORST THING
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

13:41.767 --> 13:44.933
IS TO GIVE IN
TO ONE'S DESIRES.

13:44.933 --> 13:47.100
NOW, I KNOW IN THIS CASE,
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT

13:47.100 --> 13:49.500
BECAUSE RAYMOND
IS SUCH A CUTE BOY...

13:49.500 --> 13:51.200
- OH, MY GOD.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.100
- BUT WHEN I HEARD HIM
TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS

13:58.100 --> 14:03.300
ABOUT BUYING CANDLES
AND COUNTING YOUR EGGS,

14:03.300 --> 14:05.800
I KNEW IT WAS TIME
TO CALL FATHER HUBLEY.

14:05.800 --> 14:06.800
- WHAT?

14:06.800 --> 14:07.933
WAIT A MINUTE!

14:07.933 --> 14:10.200
IS THERE EVEN A LASAGNA HERE?

14:15.600 --> 14:16.833
- WELL,

14:16.833 --> 14:19.533
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD, MARIE,

14:19.533 --> 14:23.333
BUT NO ONE
IS COMING NEAR MY EGGS.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.133
- TOUGH BREAK, RAYMOND.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.100
- BELIEVE ME, EVERYBODY.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.500
WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.533
- WELL, THEN,
I GUESS WE CAN EAT.

14:37.533 --> 14:38.700
- MARIE,

14:38.700 --> 14:40.767
IF I MAY,

14:40.767 --> 14:43.567
I'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS
ALL THESE MATTERS,

14:43.567 --> 14:45.600
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS
THE TIME OR THE PLACE.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.333
- YES, AND I MUST SAY
THAT I AM APPALLED

14:48.333 --> 14:51.433
AT THE TURN
THIS EVENING HAS TAKEN.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.967
- I THINK
WE SHOULD ALL GO.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.433
- WELL, WE HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.900
- WHEN I SAY "WE,"
I'M INCLUDING THE LASAGNA.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.933
LOVELY MEETING YOU,
DEBRA.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.433
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

15:01.433 --> 15:05.300
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS KNOWN
THE BARONE FAMILY A LONG TIME,

15:05.300 --> 15:07.300
THIS ACTUALLY
WENT QUITE WELL.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.833
IS THERE MEAT IN THAT?
- OH, YEAH.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.200
- GOOD.
LET'S GO.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.800
- [chuckles]

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
ENJOY THE MOVIE.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.167
OH, AND, RAYMOND,

15:21.167 --> 15:22.933
THAT COLOGNE
SMELLS BETTER ON YOU

15:22.933 --> 15:24.400
THAN IT DOES
ON YOUR FATHER.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.033
- DEB, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

15:30.033 --> 15:31.467
I DIDN'T TELL MY FRIENDS
ANYTHING.

15:31.467 --> 15:33.200
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.033
WAIT! MARIE!

15:36.033 --> 15:37.200
MARIE.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.167
IF YOU FELT
SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS,

15:44.167 --> 15:46.700
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
COME TALK TO ME?

15:46.700 --> 15:50.400
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.500
DO YOU NOT LIKE ME
OR SOMETHING?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.967
- OH, NO.

15:54.967 --> 15:58.000
IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.167
OH, DEBRA.

16:00.167 --> 16:04.867
I SEE THE WAY RAYMOND ACTS
AROUND YOU

16:04.867 --> 16:07.067
AND HOW HE LOOKS AT YOU

16:07.067 --> 16:11.367
AND HOW HE TALKS ABOUT YOU
TO EVERYBODY.

16:11.367 --> 16:15.600
HE HAS NEVER BEEN THIS WAY
WITH ANYONE.

16:17.033 --> 16:20.300
SO I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU TWO SHOULD WAIT

16:20.300 --> 16:23.800
UNTIL AFTER YOU'RE...

16:23.800 --> 16:25.267
YOU KNOW.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.033
- OH.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.067
- THAT'S WHY I CAME OVER.

16:32.067 --> 16:36.200
- OH, WELL...

16:36.200 --> 16:39.367
YEAH, THAT'S OKAY, MARIE.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.667
I JUST HOPE THAT WE
CAN ALWAYS TALK LIKE THIS.

16:44.733 --> 16:48.500
YOU KNOW,
INSTEAD OF BRINGING OVER LASAGNA

16:48.500 --> 16:50.800
AND A PRIEST.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.367
- OF COURSE.

16:52.367 --> 16:54.233
I LOVE TALKING TO YOU.

16:57.033 --> 17:00.067
AND, DEBRA,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

17:00.067 --> 17:04.033
IT'S REALLY NOT LIKE ME
TO MEDDLE IN MY SON'S LIFE.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.900
- LISTEN.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.133
YOU REMEMBER
BERNIE AND JOHNNY?

17:18.133 --> 17:19.300
REMEMBER HOW STUPID THEY ARE?

17:19.300 --> 17:20.300
THEY--THEY CAME OVER.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.167
THEY WERE GRABBING MY UNDERWEAR,

17:22.167 --> 17:23.733
THEY'RE TELLING ME,
"CHECK HER EGGS!

17:23.733 --> 17:24.733
CHECK HER EGGS!"

17:28.367 --> 17:29.867
HUH?

17:29.867 --> 17:31.100
- COME WITH ME.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.600
- WAIT, BUT--BUT--
- WHAT?

17:32.600 --> 17:35.033
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT WE WEREN'T--

17:35.033 --> 17:36.700
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

17:36.700 --> 17:38.233
YOUR MOTHER WAS RIGHT.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.233
YOU'RE A VERY CUTE BOY.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.167
- SO YOU ENDED UP
SLEEPING WITH ME THAT NIGHT

17:53.167 --> 17:55.033
BECAUSE OF WHAT
MY MOTHER SAID?

17:55.033 --> 17:57.767
- I GUESS SO.

18:00.567 --> 18:03.267
- BACK TO THERAPY.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.867
- ENDED UP BEING
A PRETTY GOOD NIGHT,

18:05.867 --> 18:06.933
THOUGH, DIDN'T IT?

18:06.933 --> 18:08.700
- GREAT NIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.800
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT PUTS ME
IN THE MOOD FOR?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.633
- CHINESE FOOD?

18:14.900 --> 18:16.967
- COME ON.
LET'S GO.

18:16.967 --> 18:18.133
- YOU KNOW, WAIT.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.567
- WHAT?
WAIT, WHAT?

18:19.567 --> 18:21.333
- I JUST...

18:21.333 --> 18:22.933
I-I WANT TO DO SOMETHING FIRST.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.633
YOU GO AHEAD UPSTAIRS.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.267
- WELL, BUT HURRY, THOUGH,
YOU KNOW?

18:26.267 --> 18:28.333
YOU GOT TO BE HERE
FOR SOME OF IT.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.567
- FRANK,

18:32.567 --> 18:34.600
USE YOUR NAPKIN
AND SIT UP.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.900
- HI, FRANK.
HI, ROBERT.

18:39.900 --> 18:40.900
- HEY.
- HI.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.367
- HI, MARIE.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.667
- ARE THEY TALKING?

18:47.667 --> 18:49.167
- PLEASE, GOD.

18:51.867 --> 18:54.800
- MARIE.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.100
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT

18:56.100 --> 18:57.633
THAT YOU CAME OVER
TO MY APARTMENT

18:57.633 --> 19:01.300
AND TRIED TO STOP
RAY AND ME FROM...

19:01.300 --> 19:02.800
YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.967
YOU REMEMBER
IN THE HALLWAY,

19:05.967 --> 19:08.233
HOW WE TALKED THINGS OUT?

19:08.233 --> 19:10.867
HOW THAT FELT?

19:10.867 --> 19:13.133
AND LOOK AT US NOW.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.600
I MEAN,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

19:14.600 --> 19:17.567
THIS WHOLE THING
HAS BEEN SO SILLY.

19:26.467 --> 19:30.800
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY
"TRIED" TO STOP YOU?

19:30.800 --> 19:32.533
- WHAT?

19:32.533 --> 19:36.900
- YOU SAID WE "TRIED"
TO STOP YOU AND RAYMOND.

19:36.900 --> 19:40.100
WHY WOULD YOU SAY "TRIED"?

19:40.100 --> 19:43.567
- WELL, I MEAN--

19:43.567 --> 19:45.633
- WAIT A MINUTE.

19:45.633 --> 19:50.000
DID YOU HAVE RELATIONS
WITH RAYMOND THAT NIGHT?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.633
- MARIE, THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

19:52.633 --> 19:55.367
- YOU LIED TO ME

19:55.367 --> 19:58.133
AND IN FRONT OF A PRIEST.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.733
- OH, BOY.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.500
- MARIE, WHAT YOU TOLD ME
IN THAT HALLWAY

20:04.500 --> 20:07.600
MADE ME REALIZE
HOW RAY REALLY FELT.

20:07.600 --> 20:12.533
- SO NOW YOU'RE BLAMING ME
FOR YOUR PREMARITAL SEX?

20:15.367 --> 20:19.400
- LISTEN, I CAME OVER HERE
TO--TO--TO TRY--

20:20.933 --> 20:24.033
MARIE, ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:24.033 --> 20:26.033
- THERE'S A LITTLE SAUCE LEFT.

20:26.033 --> 20:27.033
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

20:27.033 --> 20:28.533
- NO SAUCE.

20:28.533 --> 20:29.467
TALK!

20:29.467 --> 20:31.333
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
TALK TO HER!

20:31.333 --> 20:32.700
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME,
ROBERT?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.133
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.133
- YOU TAKE THAT SAUCE,

20:35.133 --> 20:36.367
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.233
NO ONE'S HAVING YOUR SAUCE
UNTIL YOU TALK TO HER!

20:55.967 --> 20:57.233
- WELL, MARIE,

20:57.233 --> 20:59.267
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING

20:59.267 --> 21:00.600
COMING OVER HERE,

21:00.600 --> 21:03.567
BECAUSE THIS PAST MONTH
OF YOU NOT TALKING TO ME

21:03.567 --> 21:06.133
HAS BEEN THE BEST MONTH
OF MY LIFE!

21:17.300 --> 21:20.400
- ROBERT, SHOOT MY EARS OFF.

21:29.933 --> 21:31.300
[door slams]

21:32.967 --> 21:36.367
- OH, MRS. BARONE!

21:36.367 --> 21:40.300
THE DOCTOR
WILL SEE YOU NOW!

21:40.300 --> 21:42.867
- I WILL NEVER
TALK TO THAT WOMAN AGAIN!

21:42.867 --> 21:45.100
I'M GOING FOR A DRIVE!

21:45.100 --> 21:46.333
[door slams]

21:49.100 --> 21:51.733
- NO,
WE HAVE A CONTRACT!

21:53.467 --> 21:55.733
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT!
