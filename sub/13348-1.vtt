00:01.790 --> 00:06.705
("Wishing on a Star"
by Anne Dudley)

00:16.760 --> 00:20.139
I'm wishing on a star

00:23.100 --> 00:26.979
To follow where you are

00:30.150 --> 00:33.984
I'm wishing on a dream

00:37.030 --> 00:40.909
To follow what it means

00:43.910 --> 00:48.449
And I wish on all the rainbows

00:48.500 --> 00:51.048
That I've seen

00:51.090 --> 00:53.968
I wish on all the people

00:54.010 --> 00:57.969
Who really dream

01:08.150 --> 01:11.859
I'm wishing on a star

01:14.740 --> 01:18.813
To follow where you are

01:27.000 --> 01:28.570
[Virginia] My name is Virginia

01:28.630 --> 01:31.497
and I live on the
edge of the forest.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.006
(chuckles)

01:33.050 --> 01:35.086
Well, kind of.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.966
My dad's a janitor.

01:40.010 --> 01:41.090
That's how we got
to have an apartment

01:41.140 --> 01:43.552
on the edge of Central Park.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.227
And you might
think that the fact

01:46.270 --> 01:48.932
that I still live with my
dad is a bit sad and...

01:48.980 --> 01:49.856
(snorts)

01:49.900 --> 01:51.686
Well, you might be right.

01:51.730 --> 01:53.027
Oh!

01:53.070 --> 01:54.606
But, I don't know, I'm
all he's got really

01:54.650 --> 01:56.777
and I'm sort of permanently

01:56.820 --> 01:59.778
between boyfriends
at the moment.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.232
So, you know.

02:03.330 --> 02:06.322
I'm just a waitress at
the grill on the park,

02:06.370 --> 02:09.328
but one day, I'm going
to find a partner

02:09.380 --> 02:12.702
and open a restaurant of my own.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.129
All I need's a good man
who's interested in food.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.466
(creaking)

02:19.510 --> 02:21.887
(clicking)

02:21.930 --> 02:22.635
(slam)

02:25.060 --> 02:26.220
- Did you see this?

02:26.270 --> 02:28.727
Look at this, this
has been chewed.

02:28.770 --> 02:29.976
It's not my job.

02:30.020 --> 02:33.262
_ This is an electrician's_
Job, but who gets to do It?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.526
Where are you going?

02:34.570 --> 02:37.027
- To work, Dad,
like I do every day.

02:37.070 --> 02:38.105
- Oh.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.809
On the way back,

02:40.870 --> 02:41.564
use the stairs.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.314
(ding)

02:42.370 --> 02:43.940
Just in case.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.491
(caws)

02:47.540 --> 02:51.749
(slow ominous music)

02:51.790 --> 02:53.667
(caws)

03:01.890 --> 03:05.678
(footsteps)

03:08.980 --> 03:10.550
- Who's there?

03:18.150 --> 03:22.610
(footsteps)

03:23.780 --> 03:24.860
(zaps)

03:24.910 --> 03:28.494
(twinkling)

03:39.090 --> 03:42.969
(vibrating hiss)

03:44.550 --> 03:48.099
(galloping)

03:48.140 --> 03:53.089
(lighthearted orchestral music)

03:54.730 --> 03:57.016
- So, where exactly
are we going?

03:57.070 --> 04:00.608
- To Beantown, in the southwest
corner of your kingdom, sir.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.902
You're accepting the throne
that the craftsmen there

04:02.950 --> 04:04.190
have made for your coronation.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.525
- Well, is it much further?

04:05.570 --> 04:06.696
- Can't we stop and go
hunting or something?

04:06.740 --> 04:08.571
- Very shortly, sir.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.826
We must make a brief stop

04:09.870 --> 04:11.952
at the Snow White
Memorial Prison.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.740
(sighs)

04:13.790 --> 04:16.167
- I hate these outer provinces.

04:16.210 --> 04:17.996
The people are so common.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.291
- Your stepmother has
applied for parole again

04:20.340 --> 04:22.046
which we will, of
course, turn down.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.250
(sighs)

04:23.300 --> 04:26.542
It's simply a routine
courtesy visit.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.011
(creaking)

04:37.520 --> 04:38.726
- Stop it!

04:38.770 --> 04:40.397
- [Relish] You're pathetic.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.600
Call yourselves trolls?

04:41.650 --> 04:42.856
You make me ashamed.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.946
- Sorry Dad.

04:43.990 --> 04:44.900
- Sorry, Dad.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.020
- It won't happen again.

04:47.070 --> 04:49.026
- [Relish] This is the last
time I come and rescue you.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.789
- Come on, Dad, take
off the magic shoes.

04:52.830 --> 04:54.115
- [Relish] I can handle them.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.287
(whooshing)

04:56.330 --> 04:58.378
(groans)

05:00.670 --> 05:01.955
(zaps)

05:02.010 --> 05:04.046
- [Tony] You know what
I'm startin' to think?

05:04.090 --> 05:05.626
I'm startin' to think that
the only kind of people

05:05.680 --> 05:08.171
they want in this
country are guys like me.

05:08.220 --> 05:12.133
You know, guys who will work
for scraps, do six jobs.

05:12.180 --> 05:15.138
Basically, bend
over and take it.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.054
Wanna know something, darling?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.556
10, 15 years tops, this country

05:17.600 --> 05:19.056
is finished as a democracy.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.601
I'm telling you, as
a caring society,

05:21.650 --> 05:23.390
where people do things for each

05:23.440 --> 05:25.067
other, we're done,
we're finished.

05:25.110 --> 05:26.156
We are out of here.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.815
- Your barbecue ribs are
on top of the microwave.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.985
(dings)

05:31.160 --> 05:33.321
- Tony, I have been
calling this elevator

05:33.370 --> 05:35.110
for the last half hour.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.366
I thought you fixed it.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.536
- I did, sir, but
it's broken again.

05:38.580 --> 05:40.127
- Well, don't take
all night on it.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.546
You've got to look
at that boiler.

05:41.590 --> 05:43.205
It's driving everybody crazy.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.830
There's air in the pipes.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.962
The whole system's got
to be drained and bled.

05:47.010 --> 05:47.999
- Yes, sir.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.290
I just have to fix the
leak in number nine

05:49.350 --> 05:50.965
and then I'm right on it.

05:51.010 --> 05:54.309
- Tony, I am only going
to tell you this once.

05:54.350 --> 05:55.669
There are an awful lot of people

05:55.730 --> 05:57.470
out there who_ would
love your job.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.930
An awful lotta people.

05:58.980 --> 06:00.140
Yes, sir.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.771
Drain the system.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.981
I'd like to drain his system.

06:07.030 --> 06:07.985
- [Victoria] Bye, Daddy.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.021
- Oh, oh, oh, listen.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.981
Don't go through
the park, promise?

06:12.030 --> 06:13.031
- Yup.

06:13.080 --> 06:13.899
- Have you got a coat?

06:13.950 --> 06:14.905
You're gonna get cold.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.406
Oh, what did you
fix me for dinner?

06:16.460 --> 06:18.030
(whoosh)

06:22.170 --> 06:24.707
- [Woman] Wait.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.502
Come to me.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.177
(snorting)

06:30.220 --> 06:35.089
(foreboding orchestral music)

06:49.110 --> 06:51.237
(yawns)

06:56.370 --> 06:59.828
- Well, this is
marvelous, isn't it?

06:59.870 --> 07:01.918
Not exactly the red
carpet treatment.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.949
- I'm sure they
won't have forgotten

07:03.000 --> 07:05.992
about our visit, Your Majesty.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.757
(creaking)

07:15.140 --> 07:16.209
- Suck an elf.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.464
- Oh, you were right.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.760
- "Maximum security."

07:18.810 --> 07:20.016
We're not supposed
to be in here.

07:20.060 --> 07:22.893
- Dad, no one's ever
allowed in there.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.100
(creaking)

07:24.150 --> 07:26.277
This is where they
keep the Queen.

07:31.610 --> 07:31.985
(whoosh)

07:32.030 --> 07:32.940
(slam)

07:36.700 --> 07:37.655
Stop.

07:37.700 --> 07:38.780
(slam)

07:41.790 --> 07:44.167
Dad, this is really bad.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.336
(creaking)

07:45.380 --> 07:46.870
(slam)

07:48.170 --> 07:50.331
- [Blabberwort] No, Dad,
Dad, where are you going?

07:50.380 --> 07:51.677
Dad, this could be a trap.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.835
- [Burly] Dad, don't.

07:52.890 --> 07:53.754
- No!

07:53.800 --> 07:54.926
- Dad!

07:54.970 --> 07:56.005
(whoosh)

07:56.050 --> 07:58.018
- [Woman] Open the door.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.933
Open the door to
everything you desire.

08:04.770 --> 08:05.976
(creaks)

08:07.940 --> 08:12.809
(woman singing acapella)

08:14.360 --> 08:15.566
- Giles?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.440
Giles?

08:19.540 --> 08:24.409
(menacing orchestral music)

08:26.880 --> 08:28.290
(creaking)

08:29.250 --> 08:30.956
Hello?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.176
(sighs)

08:38.430 --> 08:40.057
Giles.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.169
(slam)

08:45.270 --> 08:47.226
- Hello, princey!

08:47.270 --> 08:49.727
(laughing)

08:49.780 --> 08:51.316
(thud)
(yells)

08:51.360 --> 08:52.850
Did that hurt?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.948
- I'd like you to
meet my sister.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.656
(thud)
(YEIPS)

08:58.950 --> 09:00.326
(thud)
(yells)

09:01.330 --> 09:03.036
(moans)

09:04.000 --> 09:04.910
(yells)

09:04.960 --> 09:05.915
(thud)

09:05.960 --> 09:07.120
- Now he's mine.

09:07.170 --> 09:08.740
- I get the first shot.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.041
- You got the first last time.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.330
- [Bluebell] I always
get the first--

09:11.380 --> 09:12.665
- Enough.

09:12.710 --> 09:16.043
You're a long way from
your castle, Wendell.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.002
Perhaps you should
have stayed there.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.427
My silly little stepson.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.051
- You, you...

09:23.100 --> 09:24.476
You will pay for this.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.056
- On the contrary.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.104
I think that you will
beg at my feet for food.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.936
Do you know what this is?

09:32.990 --> 09:37.313
This is a very
special kind of dog.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.739
This is a magical dog.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.998
I hope you like dogs, Wendell.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.998
You're going to spend the
rest of your life as one.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.953
(suspenseful orchestral music)

09:50.000 --> 09:50.989
(pat)

09:51.040 --> 09:55.966
(twinkling)

10:08.560 --> 10:11.723
(laughing)
(clapping)

10:13.030 --> 10:14.930
(barking)

10:15.990 --> 10:17.981
Come, come, Prince Wendell.

10:18.030 --> 10:20.521
You don't greet people
on all fours, do you?

10:20.570 --> 10:21.867
(laughing)

10:23.120 --> 10:24.235
- [Relish] Get him.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.281
- Stop him, bring
him back to me alive.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.240
- We'll get him.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.076
He's not going anywhere.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.121
- He can't escape.

10:30.170 --> 10:31.706
We're in a prison.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.509
- Well, Your Highness.

10:39.050 --> 10:42.099
Just what do you have
to say for yourself?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.960
(stutters)

10:44.970 --> 10:47.723
- Where's my tail gone?

10:49.060 --> 10:50.266
- [Virginia] I guess
you get to a certain age

10:50.310 --> 10:52.141
and you realize that
nothing exciting

10:52.190 --> 10:55.523
is ever going to happen to you.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.185
And maybe that's
just the way it is.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.528
You know, maybe some people
just have quiet lives.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.988
(muffled shouting)

11:05.040 --> 11:06.780
- Give us some food, say.

11:06.830 --> 11:09.037
I haven't had any
food since yesterday.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.911
- Let us out.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.956
Come on, just give us the key.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.412
Let us out.

11:16.460 --> 11:17.540
- You.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.046
(gasps)

11:19.090 --> 11:21.081
- Hello.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.882
- What are you?

11:22.930 --> 11:24.500
- Me?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.677
A very, very fine
chap, falsely impris--

11:26.720 --> 11:29.052
- Do not make me ask again.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.800
- I'm a...

11:31.850 --> 11:32.680
(scratches)

11:32.730 --> 11:34.436
Shh...

11:34.480 --> 11:37.108
Half-wolf.

11:37.150 --> 11:39.527
- If I give you your
freedom, you must

11:39.570 --> 11:42.198
agree to serve me
without question.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.537
I am your wolf.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.866
"Loyalty" is my middle name.

11:48.910 --> 11:52.494
- I've turned Prince
Wendell into a dog.

11:52.540 --> 11:53.996
- Good idea.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.168
- Find him before the trolls.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.792
- Oh, trolls.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.501
- Wait.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.466
Give your will to me.

12:09.060 --> 12:13.269
Be mine to summon

12:13.310 --> 12:16.473
and control.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.818
Do you understand?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.605
- [Wolf] Yeah.

12:23.530 --> 12:28.399
(suspenseful action music)

12:32.790 --> 12:34.200
(grunts)

12:34.250 --> 12:35.535
(thud)
(yells)

12:35.580 --> 12:36.911
(yells)
(thud)

12:41.760 --> 12:43.045
- Come on.

12:52.930 --> 12:54.090
(sniffs)

12:54.140 --> 12:55.767
(sighs)

12:58.400 --> 12:59.970
(growls)

13:04.200 --> 13:08.318
(crashing)

13:09.370 --> 13:10.689
(whoosh)

13:10.740 --> 13:14.153
(tinkling)

13:23.970 --> 13:24.868
(barks)

13:30.220 --> 13:31.551
(growls)

13:36.980 --> 13:38.299
- [Wolf] Huff, puff.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.225
What's going on here?

13:41.650 --> 13:46.519
(whooshing)
(twinkling)

13:52.620 --> 13:53.860
(boom)

13:56.000 --> 13:57.160
(gasps)

13:57.210 --> 13:59.166
(yells)

13:59.210 --> 14:01.451
(thudding)

14:06.970 --> 14:08.289
(boom)

14:09.720 --> 14:10.755
- Wow.

14:11.810 --> 14:16.759
(big city music)

14:27.070 --> 14:28.230
(boom)

14:29.700 --> 14:30.985
(boom)

14:32.120 --> 14:33.610
(boom)

14:36.870 --> 14:38.610
- [Burly] Suck an elf.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.069
Where are we?

14:42.090 --> 14:46.003
- Wow, get a look at that.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.042
- This isn't part of
the nine kingdoms.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.967
This is a magical place.

14:51.010 --> 14:52.796
Look at all those lights.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.171
- [Bluebell] They must go
through a ton of candles.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.972
- Maybe we should
claim this kingdom.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.011
- That's a sensational idea.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.392
Let's grab it before
someone else does.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.604
- I hereby claim this land
and all its inhabitants

15:05.650 --> 15:07.936
in the name of the Troll Nation.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.062
Henceforth, it
shall be known as...

15:12.530 --> 15:14.987
What shall we call it?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.325
(gasping)

15:18.500 --> 15:19.819
- Ah.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.071
- [All] The 10th Kingdom!

15:23.130 --> 15:25.872
(epic instrumental music)

15:25.920 --> 15:29.128
- In a month, I will have
crushed the House of White.

15:29.170 --> 15:33.459
I will have Wendell's
castle and his kingdom

15:33.510 --> 15:35.000
and for helping me
to escape you may

15:35.060 --> 15:38.769
have half his kingdom to rule.

15:38.810 --> 15:42.598
- Half the fourth
kingdom, but it's huge.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.391
What's your plan?

15:47.440 --> 15:49.772
What do I have to do?

15:49.820 --> 15:51.356
- Simply allow me the
use of your children

15:51.400 --> 15:53.368
until they've captured
the Prince for me.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.275
- That's all?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.999
- Tell no one what
you've seen, of course.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.877
- Do I get to choose

16:03.920 --> 16:06.992
which half of the
kingdom I want?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.289
(moans)

16:15.010 --> 16:17.501
- Oh my god, I've killed it.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.130
Are you okay?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.727
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:21.770 --> 16:22.930
(whimpers)

16:22.980 --> 16:25.221
Where's your master?

16:25.270 --> 16:27.602
How come you don't
have a collar?

16:27.650 --> 16:31.814
(faraway chatter)

16:31.860 --> 16:34.272
Come on, let's get out of here.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.982
(comedic orchestral music)

16:39.040 --> 16:40.189
(grunts)

16:41.960 --> 16:43.666
- [Bluebell] Ah...

16:47.170 --> 16:48.239
(gasping)

16:50.010 --> 16:51.750
(screams)
(loud slam)

16:52.760 --> 16:53.829
(laughs)

16:55.140 --> 16:58.849
(footsteps)

17:03.230 --> 17:04.686
- Oh, my wallet.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.686
(clicks tongue)
(growls)

17:06.730 --> 17:07.435
- Look at this.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.560
It's not even leather.

17:08.610 --> 17:11.226
Are there any other
shoes in here?

17:12.320 --> 17:13.810
- [Blabberwort] What's this?

17:13.860 --> 17:15.521
(groans)

17:15.570 --> 17:16.446
(smack)
(grunts)

17:16.490 --> 17:19.368
Night fever, night fever

17:19.410 --> 17:21.901
We know how to do it

17:21.950 --> 17:24.157
- More magic.

17:25.210 --> 17:29.089
(distant siren wailing)

17:29.130 --> 17:31.667
(howling)

17:39.220 --> 17:40.346
- No.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.800
Virginia, just leave.

17:41.850 --> 17:43.056
Go.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.549
(barks)

17:47.850 --> 17:50.068
(grunting)

17:50.110 --> 17:51.179
- There.

17:51.230 --> 17:54.313
There's been an incident.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.099
- Aha!

17:55.150 --> 17:56.856
Lookie look.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.480
- [Burly] Dog hairs.

17:59.530 --> 18:00.827
- Ah, calfskin.

18:00.870 --> 18:01.939
Nicey nice.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.696
- Squeaky clean.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.413
(growling savagely)
(struggling)

18:15.510 --> 18:19.879
- "If found, please
return to Virginia Lewis,

18:19.930 --> 18:23.969
"apartment 2006, number two,

18:24.020 --> 18:27.638
"East Eighty-Onest Street."

18:27.690 --> 18:29.089
- "Eighty-Onest Street?"

18:29.150 --> 18:30.936
- Yeah, that's what it
says, "eighty-onest."

18:30.980 --> 18:31.969
- How 'bout this way?

18:32.020 --> 18:32.975
- Come on, let's go!

18:33.020 --> 18:35.068
- [Burly] Come on, let's go.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.856
(breathes in deeply)

18:38.910 --> 18:40.400
(exhales)

18:42.160 --> 18:43.229
(gasps)

18:43.280 --> 18:44.531
- Meat.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.865
(growls)

18:45.910 --> 18:48.959
(soft atmospheric music)

18:49.000 --> 18:52.037
(chatter)

18:54.960 --> 18:56.416
(door opens)

18:58.380 --> 19:01.543
(clattering)

19:01.590 --> 19:02.716
- Hi.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.091
- Oh, and where
have you been, huh?

19:04.140 --> 19:05.516
I've been covering for you.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.675
- [Virginia] Thank you.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.381
- Your head, you're bleeding.

19:08.430 --> 19:11.012
- I smashed my bike
and I lost my wallet

19:11.060 --> 19:13.016
and I've picked up
a new boyfriend.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.220
- Oh...

19:14.270 --> 19:15.601
(laughing)

19:15.650 --> 19:16.890
Well, hello.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.067
- I hit him with my bike,
but I don't think he's hurt.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.737
I mean, he's not
bleeding or anything.

19:20.780 --> 19:21.986
- [Candy] What's his name?

19:22.030 --> 19:23.110
- I don't know, he
doesn't have a collar.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.196
- Uh huh, come on,
let's see, huh?

19:25.240 --> 19:27.401
You look like a
prince to me, huh?

19:27.450 --> 19:28.246
Yes.

19:28.290 --> 19:29.109
- Hello, Prince.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.741
- Hello, hello.

19:30.790 --> 19:34.123
(soft atmospheric music)

19:34.170 --> 19:35.239
- Oh...

19:35.300 --> 19:36.415
(snarls)

19:36.460 --> 19:37.165
(growls)

19:37.210 --> 19:39.007
Tasty.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.546
Remember what you came here for.

19:41.590 --> 19:44.423
Find the Prince,
find the Prince.

19:45.470 --> 19:47.381
But huff puff.

19:47.430 --> 19:49.637
A wolf's got to eat, hasn't he?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.262
Can't work on an empty stomach.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.025
(sniffs)

19:57.070 --> 19:57.968
(gasps)

19:58.030 --> 19:59.770
I smell dog!

20:01.400 --> 20:02.731
Would you believe it?

20:02.780 --> 20:04.816
Work and pleasure combined.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.326
- All right, you
can stay in here

20:06.370 --> 20:08.531
and I'll come back when
I can and check on you.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.650
Don't make a noise or
you'll get me the sack.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.404
(barks)

20:12.420 --> 20:13.284
Shh.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.958
Quiet or I'll put you outside.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.125
- So, the specials are lamb--

20:21.170 --> 20:21.875
- Lamb?

20:21.930 --> 20:22.999
(gasps)

20:23.050 --> 20:24.711
New season's lamb, I hope.

20:24.760 --> 20:28.844
Young and juicy and frolicking
provocatively in the fields,

20:28.890 --> 20:32.974
bouncing up and down
with soft, fluffy wool.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.305
(gasps)

20:34.350 --> 20:35.476
Stop it.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.930
Pull yourself together.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.608
Some shepherdess not
really paying attention

20:39.650 --> 20:43.984
to the flock, probably asleep,
ifI know little girls.

20:44.990 --> 20:46.810
Well, I'm not gonna eat her.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.189
(chuckles)

20:48.240 --> 20:52.244
Not if there's a lamb ﬁlet
or a nice fat rack of chops.

20:52.290 --> 20:53.996
I'm not greedy.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.246
Well, I am greedy.

20:55.290 --> 20:56.951
I don't know why
I just said that.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.912
I have a substantial appetite.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.757
Born to gorge.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.961
That's me.

21:11.890 --> 21:13.721
(honking)

21:13.770 --> 21:15.556
(yells)

21:15.600 --> 21:16.897
- Suck an elf.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.511
(honking)

21:19.570 --> 21:21.060
(grunting)

21:23.950 --> 21:25.770
All right.

21:25.820 --> 21:26.900
(brakes squealing)

21:26.950 --> 21:29.692
(glass shattering)

21:29.740 --> 21:31.992
(radiator hissing)

21:32.040 --> 21:32.859
(yelling)

21:32.910 --> 21:35.037
(smash)

21:36.920 --> 21:39.081
Our carriage is here.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.700
(laughing)

21:40.750 --> 21:43.799
(soft atmospheric music)

21:43.840 --> 21:44.716
- Okay.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.966
- [Wolf] No, no!

21:46.010 --> 21:46.874
- [Victoria] Sir,
what can I get you?

21:46.930 --> 21:49.592
- Rare implies
dangerously cooked.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.347
When I say, "rare," I
mean just let it look

21:52.390 --> 21:55.974
at the oven in terror,
then bring it out to me.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.806
No fries, no vegetables.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.933
Just meat.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.971
Red...

22:03.030 --> 22:06.067
As a young girl's first blush.

22:09.990 --> 22:10.775
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.036
I missed that.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.695
- I'll have a jug of
margarita, a diet cola,

22:13.750 --> 22:15.456
and two beers, okay?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.319
(barking)

22:16.370 --> 22:17.280
And my wife will have--

22:17.330 --> 22:18.285
- I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.878
- A double, big...

22:20.920 --> 22:22.547
(clattering)

22:22.590 --> 22:24.956
- [Voiceover] Cold plates.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.251
- All right, that's it,
I'm taking you outside.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.631
(sighs)

22:29.680 --> 22:33.969
(slow ominous music)

22:34.020 --> 22:35.806
(chuckles)

22:35.850 --> 22:37.477
Okay, Candy, very funny.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.761
You can come out.

22:44.110 --> 22:46.066
I suppose you wrote that, eh?

22:46.110 --> 22:46.929
(barks)

22:50.950 --> 22:51.814
Bark once.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.076
(barks)

22:53.120 --> 22:53.825
(chuckles)

22:53.870 --> 22:55.690
Okay, bark twice.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.694
(barks twice)

22:56.750 --> 22:57.899
(shrieks)

22:59.500 --> 23:01.707
- Okay, so, you got
the lamb special

23:01.750 --> 23:03.536
and six glasses of warm milk.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.454
- Yeah.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.046
(gasps)

23:05.090 --> 23:05.954
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

23:06.010 --> 23:06.669
- Uh huh?

23:06.710 --> 23:07.836
- I almost forgot.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.711
Uh, I'm looking for
this lovely lady

23:09.760 --> 23:11.967
who found my doggie.

23:12.010 --> 23:14.501
- Oh, so, it's yours.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.766
Oh.

23:15.810 --> 23:16.879
I'll tell Virginia.

23:16.930 --> 23:18.932
She's out back.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.977
- Can you

23:23.060 --> 23:24.687
understand everything
I'm saying?

23:24.730 --> 23:25.264
(barks)

23:25.320 --> 23:27.686
Stop it!

23:30.950 --> 23:33.692
Well, who's in danger?

23:33.740 --> 23:34.866
Both of us?

23:34.910 --> 23:36.116
(barks)

23:36.160 --> 23:37.866
Whoa.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.367
Just wait a minute.

23:40.420 --> 23:45.289
(ominous instrumental music)

23:45.340 --> 23:47.410
- Oh, you can't come in here.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.216
- Oh.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.716
(growls)

23:53.090 --> 23:54.136
- Um...

23:54.180 --> 23:55.807
She must've gone home, you know?

23:55.850 --> 23:57.306
Maybe she hurt
herself when she fell.

23:57.350 --> 23:59.420
- Oh, poor little sausage.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.765
Why don't you tell
me where she lives?

24:00.810 --> 24:01.879
That way I can thank her.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.339
- Oh, Well, I...

24:03.400 --> 24:04.936
I can't tell you
where she lives.

24:04.980 --> 24:07.392
You know, um, I don't
know who you are.

24:07.440 --> 24:07.974
- Oh...

24:08.030 --> 24:09.019
(slam)

24:09.070 --> 24:10.640
Oh.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.191
You can tell me.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.559
(snarls)

24:15.870 --> 24:17.781
(distant siren wailing)

24:17.830 --> 24:19.991
- This is my stop.

24:21.410 --> 24:23.412
You gotta go now.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.956
(sighs)

24:29.010 --> 24:31.080
Okay, you can just
stay one night

24:31.130 --> 24:32.085
and then you're on your own.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.757
Do you understand?

24:33.800 --> 24:35.085
(barks)

24:36.390 --> 24:37.254
I've gone crazy.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.596
How can I be talking to a dog?

24:39.640 --> 24:41.176
(barking)

24:41.230 --> 24:42.049
Yes, I have.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.056
Don't try and reassure me.

24:46.020 --> 24:50.935
(snoring softly)

24:52.450 --> 24:55.408
That's Mrs. Graves
from next door.

24:58.450 --> 25:02.284
And her husband,
and their son Eric.

25:03.580 --> 25:04.319
(barks)

25:05.630 --> 25:06.415
(barks)

25:07.340 --> 25:08.204
(sighs)

25:08.250 --> 25:09.490
What's happened to them?

25:09.550 --> 25:10.869
(ding)

25:15.840 --> 25:20.004
(creaking)

25:20.060 --> 25:21.209
Wait here.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.009
(barks)

25:22.060 --> 25:23.596
Shh, Wait.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.805
I'm gonna go see
if Dad's all right.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.226
(ding)

25:28.270 --> 25:33.185
(foreboding orchestral music)

25:47.500 --> 25:48.819
Dad.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.712
Dad, wake up.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.886
(door closes)

26:00.930 --> 26:02.670
- [Burly] What do you think?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.550
Look.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.682
Here they are.

26:09.810 --> 26:12.643
(sighs admiringly)

26:12.690 --> 26:14.738
Soft cow.

26:14.780 --> 26:17.567
Nicey nice.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.941
(loud growling)

26:22.160 --> 26:24.446
- [Bluebell] Walk the catwalk.

26:28.170 --> 26:31.128
(chuckling)

26:32.710 --> 26:34.416
- Hello there, girlie.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.791
These shoes.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.001
They've been very
badly cared for.

26:38.050 --> 26:41.759
They're, they're scuffed,
and cracked and neglected.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.176
(crashing)

26:43.220 --> 26:46.769
- You have nice
shoes and so tIny.

26:46.810 --> 26:49.096
- We have hundreds
of pairs at home.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.391
- So we know what
we're talking about.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.646
- [Virginia] Who
are you and what

26:52.690 --> 26:54.226
have you done to my dad?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.929
- [Burly] Aw, he's
just sleeping.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.732
Hit him with a bit of
troll dust, that's all.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.486
- Troll dust?

27:00.530 --> 27:04.569
- I am Burly the troll, feared
throughout the nine kingdoms.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.531
- [Blabberwort] I am
Blabberwort the troll,

27:06.580 --> 27:08.957
dreaded throughout
the nine kingdoms.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.628
- [Bluebell] And I am
Bluebell the troll,

27:11.670 --> 27:14.332
terrified throughout
the nine kingdoms.

27:14.380 --> 27:15.540
(yelling)

27:15.590 --> 27:16.796
(explosion)

27:16.840 --> 27:17.909
(gasps)

27:17.970 --> 27:19.676
(crackling)

27:19.720 --> 27:24.214
- So, where is he?

27:24.260 --> 27:25.841
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:25.890 --> 27:27.926
- [Blabberwort] Prince Wendell.

27:27.980 --> 27:28.639
- Who?

27:28.680 --> 27:29.305
- [Burly] The dog.

27:29.350 --> 27:30.931
(yelpS)
(grunts)

27:30.980 --> 27:33.471
- [Blabberwort] We are going
to count to three and then we

27:33.520 --> 27:35.977
are going to make you
into a pair of shoes.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.988
- One, I'll cut the shoes.

27:39.030 --> 27:41.817
- Two, I will shape the shoes.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.272
- Three, I will stick--

27:44.330 --> 27:46.036
- All right, all right!

27:46.080 --> 27:48.537
I'll tell you where he is.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.150
He's here.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.953
He's just, uh, outside.

27:54.000 --> 27:54.830
- [Burly] Show us.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.199
Take us to him.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.836
(groaning)

27:59.880 --> 28:00.926
- [Bluebell] Go
through the door.

28:00.970 --> 28:01.755
- Be careful.

28:01.800 --> 28:02.926
- Shut up, Bluebell.

28:02.970 --> 28:04.255
(ding)

28:06.390 --> 28:06.958
Where is he?

28:07.010 --> 28:08.090
(ding)

28:09.180 --> 28:11.341
- He's hiding, uh...

28:11.390 --> 28:13.688
Behind those doors.

28:13.730 --> 28:14.890
(grunting)

28:16.150 --> 28:17.686
(yelling)

28:17.730 --> 28:18.936
(gasping)

28:22.070 --> 28:24.118
You are crafty.

28:24.160 --> 28:29.029
(soft menacing music)

28:33.790 --> 28:34.996
- Oh, yes, he's here.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.247
I'm, I'm just gonna
operate the secret door

28:37.290 --> 28:39.952
and show you where he's hiding.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.369
- [Burly] No!

28:42.430 --> 28:43.874
It's a trick.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.170
- [Bluebell] Open this door!

28:45.220 --> 28:46.130
(slam)

28:46.180 --> 28:48.922
(screaming)

28:49.890 --> 28:51.676
- Suck an elf.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.846
(yelling)

28:53.890 --> 28:54.891
Open up.

28:54.940 --> 28:57.397
(zapping)

29:03.240 --> 29:04.446
- All right, come on.

29:04.490 --> 29:05.605
Let's get out of here.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.524
Dad'll be all right.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.231
I think it's you they're after.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.956
(knocking)

29:15.000 --> 29:18.492
(snoring)

29:18.540 --> 29:20.371
(knocking)

29:24.970 --> 29:26.926
- Oh, whatever it is, go away.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.506
- Good evening.

29:28.550 --> 29:32.384
Trolls have been to
VlSlt you fIrst, I see.

29:32.430 --> 29:32.919
(claps)

29:32.980 --> 29:34.220
No matter.

29:34.270 --> 29:38.058
Tonight and tonight
only, I am authorized

29:38.110 --> 29:40.897
to make you a unique offer.

29:40.940 --> 29:43.852
Namely, the end to all your
personal and financial problems.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.310
- Hey, hey, just hold
it a second right there.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.987
You take another step,
I'm gonna call the cops.

29:47.030 --> 29:47.906
It's private property.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.235
- Under the terms of this policy

29:49.280 --> 29:51.111
I am, in exchange
for information

29:51.160 --> 29:53.071
as to the whereabouts
of your daughter,

29:53.120 --> 29:58.035
able to offer you
this magic bean

29:58.080 --> 29:59.957
which, once eaten, will give you

30:00.000 --> 30:03.629
six glorious wishes.

30:03.670 --> 30:04.830
(snorts)

30:06.430 --> 30:08.671
Is this her?

30:11.180 --> 30:13.466
This can't be her.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.339
- What do you mean?

30:14.390 --> 30:16.221
- Oh, she's succulent!

30:16.270 --> 30:19.478
What a dreamy, creamy girl!

30:19.520 --> 30:20.851
(whimpering)

30:21.860 --> 30:24.351
(whimpering)

30:26.240 --> 30:31.109
(howling)

30:32.990 --> 30:35.117
Tasty, or what?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.786
(grunting rhythmically)

30:39.830 --> 30:41.411
(yelling)

30:43.630 --> 30:46.963
(yelling)
(crackling)

30:47.010 --> 30:48.921
(exhausted sigh)

30:51.350 --> 30:53.136
- I've been thinking
back over the years

30:53.180 --> 30:55.637
and I feel this
is quite the worst

30:55.680 --> 30:58.057
spell we have ever
been put under.

30:58.100 --> 31:01.809
- We've had some stinkers
but nothing like this.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.352
She's a powerful
little witch, that one.

31:06.900 --> 31:11.735
- I think we might
be in her pocket.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.486
- [Blabberwort] Hmm?

31:13.530 --> 31:14.781
- What?

31:14.830 --> 31:17.867
- I think she might
have shrunk us

31:17.910 --> 31:21.994
and put us in a
matchbox in her pocket.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.628
- That's ridiculous.

31:28.670 --> 31:29.921
You're falling to pieces.

31:29.970 --> 31:31.130
Get a grip on yourself.

31:31.180 --> 31:35.002
How can we be in a
matchbox, you idiot?

31:36.020 --> 31:39.057
Where are all the matches?

31:39.100 --> 31:41.432
(vibrating squeal)

31:44.320 --> 31:47.312
(soft boinging)

31:47.360 --> 31:49.442
- What the hell's it doing?

31:50.490 --> 31:53.698
- Six big wishes.

31:53.740 --> 31:57.574
Imagine having
anything you desire.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.327
And from the look of
your modest surroundings

32:01.370 --> 32:03.531
I'm sure there are many things
that you'd love to change.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.956
- I, oh...

32:05.000 --> 32:07.161
Well, you know, I would...

32:08.300 --> 32:11.622
Uh, just get the hell out
of my apartment, all right?

32:14.510 --> 32:15.670
Well...

32:15.720 --> 32:16.926
This is a joke, right?

32:16.970 --> 32:17.880
- No, no.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.557
It's a standard
multiple-wishes deal,

32:19.600 --> 32:22.228
six wishes, no going
back on wishes once made,

32:22.270 --> 32:24.898
no making five wishes and
wishing for another thousand.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.682
Now, come on, is that
a fair deal or what?

32:27.730 --> 32:28.719
Now...

32:28.780 --> 32:33.900
Where is your lovely daughter?

32:33.950 --> 32:35.406
(sniffs)

32:37.030 --> 32:38.657
- What do you want her for?

32:38.700 --> 32:41.749
- Simply to reclaim my little
doggy which she found earlier.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.326
- Dog?

32:44.380 --> 32:45.916
- There's even a reward involved

32:45.960 --> 32:48.747
which I intend to
give her personally.

32:51.510 --> 32:52.829
(sighs)

32:54.130 --> 32:56.758
- If she's not at work she'll
be at my mother-in-law's.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.347
- Ooh.

32:58.390 --> 33:00.381
- She's always trying to
turn Virginia against me.

33:00.430 --> 33:02.637
- Does this mother-in-law
like, uh, flowers?

33:02.690 --> 33:03.930
- She likes money.

33:03.980 --> 33:04.935
That's the only thing
that impresses her.

33:04.980 --> 33:07.471
- Address, please.

33:14.030 --> 33:16.316
It's been a pleasure.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.234
- Wait, hold on a second.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.486
How long does this take to work?

33:19.540 --> 33:22.748
- Oh, don't worry,
the first three hours

33:22.790 --> 33:24.451
are the worst.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.956
(sighs)

33:26.960 --> 33:29.622
- Anything I want, huh?

33:35.720 --> 33:36.835
(snorts)

33:41.470 --> 33:43.347
Ooh...

33:45.890 --> 33:47.391
Okay.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.977
All right, for my first wish...

33:50.020 --> 33:52.739
(stomach grumbling deeply)

33:53.860 --> 33:55.236
For my f...

33:56.610 --> 33:57.986
For my f...

33:59.120 --> 34:01.691
(groaning in pain)

34:09.290 --> 34:10.780
- [Virginia] Hello?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.876
- [Grandma] Who is it?

34:14.380 --> 34:15.836
- It's only me, Grandma.

34:20.930 --> 34:22.090
(laughing)

34:22.140 --> 34:24.882
- For a moment there I
thought It was your mother.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.591
(laughs)

34:26.640 --> 34:29.518
- Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.937
Would you mind ifI
stayed the night tonight?

34:31.980 --> 34:35.029
- You know, she'll
come back one day.

34:35.070 --> 34:39.484
She'll just swan
in without a word.

34:40.780 --> 34:44.159
You don't think she could
be in Aspen, do you?

34:44.200 --> 34:45.997
She always loved the snow.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.860
- Well...

34:47.920 --> 34:50.377
I think she would
have come back by now.

34:50.420 --> 34:54.789
I don't know, 14 years is
a long time for apres—ski.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.217
- Don't be cheap, dear.

34:59.340 --> 35:00.671
(barking)

35:00.720 --> 35:01.789
(yipping)

35:01.850 --> 35:04.216
God, what's that?

35:04.260 --> 35:06.763
- This is a stray
I picked up today.

35:06.810 --> 35:09.973
- Well, just keep
him away from Roland.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.931
He's probably got fleas.

35:11.980 --> 35:13.436
- Aw, you don't have fleas.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.811
Do you have fleas?

35:14.860 --> 35:17.272
No, shh, shh.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.857
(yipping)

35:21.910 --> 35:23.025
Thanks.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.571
- You know, you could still be

35:25.620 --> 35:29.249
something in society, Virginia.

35:29.290 --> 35:31.702
I have connections, you know.

35:31.750 --> 35:36.119
Your mother's debut at
the Ritz Carlton was, ah.

35:36.170 --> 35:38.832
A coronation.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.838
At 19 she could have
had any bachelor

35:41.890 --> 35:45.132
in the whole of New York.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.841
And what does she end up with?

35:46.890 --> 35:48.221
- Dad.

35:48.270 --> 35:50.181
- Dad.

35:50.230 --> 35:54.052
Don't throw away your life
the way she did, Virginia.

35:54.110 --> 35:57.853
I can see the whole thing
happening all over again.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.948
You're a waitress,
for god's sakes.

35:59.990 --> 36:00.854
(thud)

36:00.900 --> 36:02.561
Who are you going to meet?

36:02.610 --> 36:06.239
Some eligible short-order cook?

36:06.290 --> 36:08.406
(laughs)

36:08.450 --> 36:09.826
- No.

36:09.870 --> 36:12.418
(knocking)

36:14.380 --> 36:15.995
(knocking)

36:17.000 --> 36:19.412
- Oh, so, of course
you never fixed

36:19.460 --> 36:21.371
the pipes like you promised.

36:21.430 --> 36:23.045
That I've come to expect.

36:23.090 --> 36:25.092
But this!

36:25.140 --> 36:26.505
- I can, um, this...

36:26.560 --> 36:28.710
I can explain all of
this, and I'm going to.

36:28.770 --> 36:29.725
I'll get on it right
away, Mr. Murray.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.010
- No.

36:31.060 --> 36:33.722
"I'm gonna get on it"
is not good enough.

36:33.770 --> 36:37.149
I want you and your daughter
out of this apartment today.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.600
- Fire, fired?

36:39.650 --> 36:40.776
No, please, Mr. Murray...

36:40.820 --> 36:42.811
- What, you big jerk?

36:43.820 --> 36:46.698
- I wish you and
your entire family

36:46.740 --> 36:51.200
would kiss my ass and
be my slaves forever.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.572
- What did you just say?

36:54.630 --> 36:56.951
(hiss)

36:57.000 --> 37:00.754
Oh, Master.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.040
(short laugh)

37:17.690 --> 37:20.102
- [Burly] How long do you
think this spell will last?

37:20.150 --> 37:21.686
- It can't last long.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.638
- [Burly] 100 years?

37:22.690 --> 37:24.066
- At most.

37:24.110 --> 37:25.771
Maybe only 50.

37:25.820 --> 37:28.983
- We'll just have to make
the most of our imprisonment.

37:29.030 --> 37:32.249
And agree not to eat each other.

37:32.290 --> 37:34.076
- Absolutely, absolutely.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.578
We'll do the hundred
years and maybe

37:37.630 --> 37:39.586
if we're lucky we'll
only have to do

37:39.630 --> 37:42.963
two-thirds of the spell
and get out early.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.835
(doorbell buzzing)

37:45.880 --> 37:50.806
(smooth orchestral music)

38:04.530 --> 38:05.736
(gasps)

38:06.950 --> 38:08.315
- Oh.

38:08.370 --> 38:09.940
I, there must be some mistake.

38:09.990 --> 38:11.571
I do apologize.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.941
I was looking for
Virginia's grandmother.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.786
- I am she.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.457
- That cannot be.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.910
Her young sister, perhaps.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.780
Her mother perhaps.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.410
But her grandmother?

38:22.460 --> 38:23.700
Pah!

38:23.760 --> 38:27.924
You are a dazzling beauty.

38:27.970 --> 38:29.756
- Oh.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.304
Well, I, I don't have my
makeup on or anything yet.

38:33.350 --> 38:34.590
- May I come in?

38:34.640 --> 38:35.880
I have flowers.

38:35.930 --> 38:38.182
- Yeah, but who are you?

38:39.270 --> 38:41.852
I am Virginia's suitor.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.436
Her betrothed.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.640
(kisses)

38:44.690 --> 38:45.987
Betrothed?

38:46.030 --> 38:48.772
She didn't say anything
about a fiance.

38:48.820 --> 38:51.778
- How like her, how modest.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.367
Most girls would brag and
boast about dating the heir

38:54.410 --> 38:57.709
to an enormous fortune,
but not Virginia.

38:57.750 --> 39:00.742
- Oh, well, do come in.

39:00.790 --> 39:05.545
I'll, I'll just go
and get dressed.

39:05.590 --> 39:06.716
- Of course.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.671
Get dressed.

39:11.050 --> 39:13.712
(humming)

39:20.850 --> 39:23.728
- Okay, Wish Master.

39:23.770 --> 39:27.558
Give me a never-ending
supply of beer.

39:29.820 --> 39:32.311
Two?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.577
_ You call that a wild
night where you come from?

39:34.620 --> 39:35.484
Oh.

39:35.540 --> 39:40.239
(adventurous instrumental music)

39:50.470 --> 39:52.506
Hey, oh, Murray, Murray!

39:52.550 --> 39:54.848
Murray, you got to see this.

39:54.890 --> 39:58.018
The refrigerator,
it just keeps go...

39:59.640 --> 40:00.937
What are you doing?

40:00.980 --> 40:03.801
- I'm worried that they're
not clean enough, Master.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.818
Shall I lick your shoes again?

40:06.860 --> 40:09.272
- Let me see your tongue.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.311
All right, five more minutes.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.442
How is your mother
coming with that door?

40:13.490 --> 40:18.405
- Oh, uh, almost
done now, Master.

40:18.450 --> 40:19.576
- Just hurry--

40:19.620 --> 40:20.826
No, stop, no, no.

40:20.870 --> 40:22.280
Once was enough.

40:22.330 --> 40:24.662
Here, open this.

40:25.710 --> 40:29.043
What shall I wish for next?

40:29.090 --> 40:31.718
Iwish...

40:34.220 --> 40:36.176
I wish I had
something that would

40:36.220 --> 40:38.552
clean this apartment
all by itself,

40:38.600 --> 40:40.921
and I would never
have to lift a finger.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.884
(whirring)

40:42.940 --> 40:44.055
- [Vacuum] Oh, here we go.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.180
(gasps)

40:46.860 --> 40:48.350
(laughing)

40:48.400 --> 40:49.810
Here we go, clean, clean,
clean clean, clean...

40:49.860 --> 40:51.851
- Clean.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.356
- [Vacuum] Oh, gotta
get this cleaned up.

40:53.410 --> 40:54.559
Oh, oh, look here.

40:54.610 --> 40:56.578
Oh, there's dust
all over the floor.

40:57.870 --> 41:00.441
Pick it up, pick
it up, pick it up.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.819
Oh, here's some over here.

41:01.870 --> 41:03.826
Here's some more, oh!

41:04.750 --> 41:07.287
(muffled shrieking)

41:07.340 --> 41:08.876
- I am so bad.

41:08.920 --> 41:10.956
I can't believe I'm doing this.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.910
Oh, still...

41:12.970 --> 41:15.586
I suppose you would look
better surrounded by potatoes.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.755
(giggles)

41:18.010 --> 41:19.500
Where's the garlic?

41:19.560 --> 41:20.879
The rosemary?

41:20.930 --> 41:23.637
Oh, what do I have
to work with here?

41:23.690 --> 41:26.261
Three-year-old dried herbs?

41:26.310 --> 41:27.937
(growls)

41:27.980 --> 41:32.235
Oh huff, you're not gonna
fit in the oven, are ya?

41:32.280 --> 41:34.145
Not in one piece, anyway.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.862
(upbeat orchestral music)

41:36.910 --> 41:38.150
Shepherdess

41:38.200 --> 41:39.906
Makes greatness

41:39.950 --> 41:42.657
The little lambs are lonely

41:42.700 --> 41:43.860
Shepherdess

41:43.910 --> 41:45.161
(gasps)

41:45.210 --> 41:46.780
Oh, what am I doing?

41:46.830 --> 41:48.741
I should untie you.

41:48.790 --> 41:51.509
Oh, a poor old lady
frightened out of her wits.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.667
I should untie you...

41:54.720 --> 41:58.178
But first I'll put a dollop
of fat in the oven tray.

41:58.220 --> 41:59.790
- [Virginia] Grandmother?

41:59.850 --> 42:01.636
- Oh, oh, guests are up.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.807
Breakfast isn't ready.

42:15.240 --> 42:17.526
- Grandmother?

42:17.570 --> 42:20.198
- [Wolf] In here, darling.

42:27.290 --> 42:28.325
(knocking)

42:28.380 --> 42:29.665
- Grandmother?

42:29.710 --> 42:31.792
- [Wolf] In here, darling.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.751
- Good morning.

42:34.800 --> 42:38.258
Do you want some coffee
or toast or something?

42:41.890 --> 42:44.131
(whimpering)

42:44.180 --> 42:46.762
What's wrong?

42:46.810 --> 42:48.129
You got a cold?

42:48.190 --> 42:48.975
(whimpers)

42:49.020 --> 42:49.975
Grandma?

42:50.020 --> 42:51.817
- Surprise!

42:55.780 --> 42:56.895
Oh, boy.

42:56.950 --> 42:59.350
You're fantastic.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.401
Your picture doesn't
do you justice.

43:01.450 --> 43:03.361
Wow!

43:03.410 --> 43:04.650
Oh, no.

43:04.700 --> 43:07.282
How did this get here?

43:07.330 --> 43:08.820
No, no, oh no.

43:08.870 --> 43:10.622
Oh, no.

43:10.670 --> 43:12.956
By the way, where is the dog?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.753
Sleeping in if I know royalty.

43:15.800 --> 43:19.292
Oh, you smell great.

43:19.340 --> 43:21.797
I've had little teasers
of your scent before,

43:21.850 --> 43:24.808
Virginia, but in the flesh, ah!

43:24.850 --> 43:26.806
Perfumes are not for me, no.

43:26.850 --> 43:29.728
I respond favorably to
the audacity of a woman

43:29.770 --> 43:33.729
who flaunts her
own aroma, and you,

43:33.770 --> 43:37.729
Virginia, you smell
like Sunday lunch.

43:37.780 --> 43:38.735
(snarls)

43:38.780 --> 43:40.099
- You keep away from me.

43:40.160 --> 43:44.733
- Oh, beautiful eyes,
beautiful teeth.

43:44.780 --> 43:48.534
All the right stuff in
all the right places.

43:48.580 --> 43:52.869
No doubt about it, I am in love.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.785
Mmm...

43:54.840 --> 43:56.580
(glass shatters)

44:11.810 --> 44:14.187
Let me put your mind at rest.

44:14.230 --> 44:17.643
Now that I've seen you eating
you is out of the question.

44:17.690 --> 44:19.851
Not even on the menu.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.982
Oh, now, I know this
is going to come out

44:22.030 --> 44:25.272
of the blue but
how about a date?

44:25.330 --> 44:29.699
We've started badly but I
take all the blame for that.

44:29.750 --> 44:30.648
(snarls)

44:31.710 --> 44:32.199
(thud)

44:32.250 --> 44:33.740
Oh.

44:33.790 --> 44:35.530
Come on, give us
a chance, please.

44:35.590 --> 44:36.830
Ooh!

44:36.880 --> 44:39.451
Oh, you are one dynamic lady.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.659
There's no question there.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.869
(slam)

44:41.930 --> 44:43.636
(howling)

44:43.680 --> 44:44.749
(thud)

44:47.140 --> 44:48.846
(sighing)

44:51.180 --> 44:52.977
(faint shrieking)

44:53.020 --> 44:55.648
(shrieking)

44:58.190 --> 44:59.396
- Oh my god.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.101
Grandmother!

45:03.570 --> 45:04.730
- [Vacuum] Out of my
way, out of my way.

45:04.780 --> 45:06.520
Work, work, work.

45:06.570 --> 45:07.525
- No, no, no, no.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.036
Okay, okay, fine.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.196
Thank you, that's enough, go.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.781
Thank you, go do something else.

45:15.830 --> 45:16.831
-Mmmm

45:16.880 --> 45:18.495
- What, no, hey, hey,
get up, get up, get up.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.370
Listen, you've already
kissed me three times today.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.910
- Let me kiss you again, Master.

45:21.970 --> 45:24.677
- No, go clean something.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.675
You're ridiculous.

45:25.720 --> 45:28.006
- Master, oh, wonderful Master.

45:28.050 --> 45:31.508
My wife has a surprise for you.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.629
- Oh, really?

45:32.680 --> 45:34.136
Well, I'll take care of her.

45:34.190 --> 45:35.509
You go get me a beer.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.107
- Yes, Master.

45:37.150 --> 45:39.391
- It's my husband's
Rolex Oyster.

45:39.440 --> 45:40.816
Solid gold.

45:40.860 --> 45:43.101
- Are you sure it's not one
of those cheap imitations?

45:43.150 --> 45:45.061
- Oh, no, Master.

45:45.110 --> 45:46.987
- Whoa, oh!

45:47.030 --> 45:48.736
(gasping)

45:51.330 --> 45:53.321
birthday but you must have it.

45:53.370 --> 45:56.328
All our possessions
are yours now.

45:56.370 --> 45:57.871
- Murray, I'm gonna
take your wife

45:57.920 --> 46:02.038
out and buy her some underwear.

46:02.090 --> 46:03.660
- Of course, Master.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.676
Help yourself.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.927
- Uh, Master.

46:08.970 --> 46:10.676
I, um, I think there
might be someone

46:10.720 --> 46:12.881
trapped in the elevator.

46:12.930 --> 46:16.138
I can hear voices and banging.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.680
- Yes, well, I don't
know if you've noticed,

46:17.730 --> 46:19.937
but I'm no longer Mr.
Fix-It, so why don't you get

46:19.980 --> 46:22.778
your rich behind out
there and fix it yourself?

46:22.820 --> 46:25.892
- At once, Master.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.906
(shattering)

46:32.490 --> 46:35.709
- I think we need
some spending money.

46:35.750 --> 46:40.369
Wish Master, how about
a million dollars?

46:40.420 --> 46:42.206
(doorbell rings)

46:42.250 --> 46:44.411
(gasping excitedly)

46:47.630 --> 46:49.177
(chuckles)

46:56.560 --> 46:59.051
(laughing)

46:59.100 --> 47:00.681
Oh, yes, I'm rich.

47:00.730 --> 47:02.766
I'm rich, I'm rich!

47:02.820 --> 47:05.027
Say hello to Benny.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.657
(sputters)

47:22.420 --> 47:23.660
- Can I help you?

47:23.710 --> 47:25.792
- Oh, I hope so.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.252
I'm very confused.

47:28.300 --> 47:30.040
- You must be Paul's referral.

47:30.090 --> 47:32.672
He said you'd drop by
to make an appointment.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.803
- Can you tell me
what I'm doing here?

47:36.640 --> 47:38.688
- Let's get to know
each other a bit

47:38.730 --> 47:42.188
before we tackle the
big questions, okay?

47:43.650 --> 47:45.811
- Yeah, big questions.

47:45.860 --> 47:50.809
- Now, I'm going
to give you a word

47:50.860 --> 47:52.987
and I want you to
say the first word

47:53.030 --> 47:55.828
that comes into your mind, okay?

47:55.870 --> 47:57.360
- Game, yeah.

47:57.410 --> 48:00.493
- Here we go, "home."

48:00.540 --> 48:02.417
- Cooking.

48:02.460 --> 48:03.245
- "Coward."

48:03.290 --> 48:05.246
- Chicken.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.624
- "Wedding."

48:08.670 --> 48:11.252
- Cake.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.749
- "Dead."

48:14.800 --> 48:16.131
- Meat.

48:20.810 --> 48:22.892
- "Sexual."

48:22.940 --> 48:24.931
- Appetite.

48:29.150 --> 48:30.026
- "Love."

48:30.070 --> 48:30.946
(gasps)

48:30.990 --> 48:33.732
- To eat anything fluffy!

48:33.780 --> 48:34.656
(grunts)

48:35.660 --> 48:37.321
Sorry, sorry.

48:37.370 --> 48:38.280
More than one word.

48:38.330 --> 48:39.900
Start again.

48:39.950 --> 48:42.953
(frantic instrumental music)

48:43.000 --> 48:45.537
- You know, Murray,
this is ridiculous.

48:45.590 --> 48:46.830
No, stop.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.791
Listen, I want everybody out
of here except your wife.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.467
I had no idea you had
so many relatives.

48:50.510 --> 48:51.659
- Of course, Master.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.210
- [Vacuum] Clean,
clean, clean, clean.

48:54.220 --> 48:55.380
- You can go.

48:55.430 --> 48:56.636
- Be with you in
a moment, Murray.

48:56.680 --> 49:00.013
Just got to pucker
up to the Master.

49:00.060 --> 49:03.302
- Uh, uh, don't pucker.

49:03.350 --> 49:06.057
Hey, hey, cut that out.

49:06.110 --> 49:09.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:09.360 --> 49:12.568
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

49:12.610 --> 49:13.850
Stop.

49:13.910 --> 49:15.229
- [Vacuum] Clean it up,
clean it up, clean it up.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.737
Clean it up, clean
it up, clean it up.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.577
Clean it up!

49:19.620 --> 49:21.110
- [Tony] Oh, jeez.

49:21.160 --> 49:24.823
(shattering)

49:28.800 --> 49:29.698
I said...

49:29.750 --> 49:31.331
Stop!

49:31.380 --> 49:34.178
Stop, stop!

49:34.220 --> 49:39.055
(sirens wailing)

49:43.020 --> 49:45.181
(shouting)

49:45.230 --> 49:48.814
- [Officer] Upstairs,
move it, move it!

49:49.860 --> 49:52.488
- I can't stop it, Master!

49:52.530 --> 49:54.441
Thank you, thank you, Master.

49:54.490 --> 49:56.560
- All right, just take it.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.361
- I'm trying!

50:04.830 --> 50:06.957
It's not gonna stop, Master.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.706
Master, wait!

50:08.750 --> 50:11.332
- Come on.

50:11.380 --> 50:14.668
Please, just, let's go.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.836
(yelling)

50:16.880 --> 50:18.677
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:18.720 --> 50:20.005
- [Officer] Move, move!

50:21.760 --> 50:23.808
- Wait a minute, whoa!

50:23.850 --> 50:25.386
What's the matter?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.304
- Spread 'em!

50:26.350 --> 50:27.840
- All right, what have I done?

50:27.900 --> 50:29.436
- Bingo, lookit here.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.811
The money from the robbery.

50:30.860 --> 50:33.181
- No, hold on a
second, no, no, no.

50:33.230 --> 50:36.449
That just appeared
in front of my door.

50:36.490 --> 50:38.026
I've been in my
apartment all day.

50:38.070 --> 50:40.118
All these people can
vouch for me, right?

50:40.160 --> 50:43.197
- Yes, oh Master.

50:44.540 --> 50:48.032
- I've been here all day just
having a beer with friends.

50:48.080 --> 50:51.208
(explosion)

50:52.210 --> 50:55.088
- You know, I think
you're still holding back.

50:55.130 --> 50:56.040
(snorts)

50:56.090 --> 50:59.753
What is really troubling you?

50:59.800 --> 51:03.133
- Okay, all right, all right.

51:03.180 --> 51:06.559
Doc, I met this terrific
girl and I really,

51:06.600 --> 51:11.185
really, really like her
but the thing is that...

51:11.230 --> 51:13.437
- Go on, say it.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.777
Say it!

51:14.820 --> 51:17.857
- I'm not sure whether
I, I want to love her,

51:17.900 --> 51:18.980
or eat her.

51:19.030 --> 51:20.691
(growls)

51:20.740 --> 51:22.571
- Oh, oh.

51:22.620 --> 51:24.656
Of course, I blame my parents.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.691
They were both enormous.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.865
They couldn't stop eating.

51:27.910 --> 51:29.411
Every day I came
home from school

51:29.460 --> 51:32.532
it was, "eat this,
eat that, eat her!"

51:32.590 --> 51:33.989
- You shouldn't punish yourself.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.790
- Oh, I should, I should.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.955
I'm bad, I'm so bad.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.796
I've done so many bad things!

51:38.840 --> 51:40.125
But that wasn't me, you see?

51:40.180 --> 51:42.546
That was when I was a wolf.

51:44.470 --> 51:45.767
Doc, I wanna change.

51:45.810 --> 51:47.766
I want to be a good person.

51:47.810 --> 51:51.098
Oh, can't the lion
cuddle up with the lamb?

51:51.150 --> 51:54.472
Can't the leopard rub
out all its spots?

51:54.520 --> 51:56.727
- This is the exact
spot where I found you

51:56.780 --> 51:58.270
so this is really where we have

51:58.320 --> 52:00.026
to go our separate ways, okay?

52:00.070 --> 52:00.946
(barks)

52:00.990 --> 52:02.025
(sighs)

52:02.070 --> 52:03.446
(barks)

52:03.490 --> 52:06.948
Look, I'm not the
adventure type, you know?

52:06.990 --> 52:09.572
I mean, I'm a waitress.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.781
This just really...

52:11.830 --> 52:14.242
This isn't my thing.

52:14.290 --> 52:15.746
Whoever these people
are who want you,

52:15.800 --> 52:16.698
they can have you.

52:16.750 --> 52:18.251
(barking)

52:18.300 --> 52:19.460
No, I got to go.

52:19.510 --> 52:21.216
Goodbye, I gotta go.

52:22.760 --> 52:25.092
(whines)

52:27.470 --> 52:30.689
- Here is the reading list
I strongly recommend now.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.186
- Okay.

52:32.230 --> 52:33.094
- Why don't you come back
and see me next week?

52:33.150 --> 52:34.515
- Oh, but you don't understand.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.515
I won't be here next week.

52:35.570 --> 52:37.219
- Uh, uh, uh, uh.

52:37.280 --> 52:40.272
You're not going to
intimidate me with suicide.

52:40.320 --> 52:42.231
That's better.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.986
- Okay.

52:45.530 --> 52:46.906
- If you cooperate and give us

52:46.950 --> 52:49.612
the dealer's name, maybe I'll
put in a good word for you.

52:49.660 --> 52:50.570
- Dealer, what dealer?

52:50.620 --> 52:51.780
I'm not taking drugs.

52:51.830 --> 52:53.070
- Yeah, right.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.280
You don't remember
stealing the money

52:54.330 --> 52:55.581
because you were
undertheinﬂuence

52:55.630 --> 52:57.370
of these magic mushrooms, right?

52:57.420 --> 52:58.626
- Magic mushrooms?

52:58.670 --> 52:59.876
- No, I didn't take...

52:59.920 --> 53:01.376
Well, I swallowed
the bean, but...

53:01.420 --> 53:05.208
- I almost fixed the
elevator now, Master.

53:05.260 --> 53:09.594
- We will break the
spell, trust me.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.720
- I trust you.

53:10.770 --> 53:13.591
- I trust you more.

53:13.640 --> 53:14.720
- No, I trust you more.

53:14.770 --> 53:15.680
- Yeah.

53:15.730 --> 53:16.606
- I trust her more.

53:16.650 --> 53:17.355
- I trust her!

53:17.400 --> 53:18.389
- I always trusted her!

53:18.440 --> 53:19.520
- Suck an elf!

53:19.570 --> 53:21.856
(yelling)

53:24.700 --> 53:29.649
(slamming)

53:34.290 --> 53:36.372
- [Burly] We're moving.

53:36.420 --> 53:37.830
- We're going down.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.791
- Is that good or bad?

53:39.840 --> 53:44.083
- We are about to
enter the underworld.

53:44.130 --> 53:47.293
Prepare yourselves.

53:47.350 --> 53:48.544
(ding)

53:50.600 --> 53:52.761
(yelling)

53:54.730 --> 53:58.473
- This isn't the
underworld, you idiot.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.260
This is where we came in.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.719
- Magic, indeed.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.566
How did she do that?

54:05.740 --> 54:07.731
- Ah, suck an elf.

54:08.740 --> 54:09.616
(gasps)

54:09.660 --> 54:12.493
- Sheep, sometimes I like sheep.

54:12.540 --> 54:13.689
Ooh!

54:16.500 --> 54:18.661
Excuse me, I need
everything on this list

54:18.710 --> 54:22.168
and anything else you might
think is useful, please, Miss?

54:23.210 --> 54:23.915
(gasps)

54:23.970 --> 54:25.164
Thank you very much.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.006
And if my plan is
successful I will

54:27.050 --> 54:29.041
certainly invite
you to the wedding.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.967
That's mine, that's mine, too.

54:33.810 --> 54:37.018
- [Tony] Hey, hey, couldn't
we come to some kind of deal?

54:37.060 --> 54:38.140
You know what?

54:38.190 --> 54:40.476
I can give you
anything you wanted.

54:40.520 --> 54:42.351
Anything whatever, I'm serious.

54:42.400 --> 54:46.484
A house in the Hamptons,
boats, cars, women.

54:46.530 --> 54:47.770
Whatever you want.

54:47.820 --> 54:50.402
It won't make it any
better trying to bribe us.

54:50.450 --> 54:55.365
(suspenseful instrumental music)

55:03.590 --> 55:05.797
- Well, what have I got to lose?

55:05.840 --> 55:09.549
I wish I could escape from
this police car right now.

55:09.590 --> 55:11.638
(chuckling)

55:14.520 --> 55:17.683
- Wes, the brakes are failing.

55:19.810 --> 55:21.607
(honking)

55:21.650 --> 55:23.311
- No!

55:23.360 --> 55:25.817
- "How to Marry the
Girl of Your Dreams."

55:25.860 --> 55:28.442
That's exactly what
I'm looking for.

55:28.490 --> 55:30.151
- Oh, my god.

55:30.200 --> 55:34.489
(crashing)

55:35.620 --> 55:37.030
(slam)

55:38.830 --> 55:40.286
- Stupid idiot.

55:40.330 --> 55:42.912
Stop that man right now!

55:42.960 --> 55:44.587
He's getting away.

55:46.130 --> 55:47.757
- Hey, pal.

55:50.090 --> 55:51.580
- Thank you, thank you.

55:51.640 --> 55:54.552
- No, wait, you
haven't paid for those!

55:57.680 --> 55:58.920
(barking)

55:58.980 --> 56:01.687
- Look, I cannot take you
back to where you came from

56:01.730 --> 56:04.642
because I don't know
where you came from.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.772
No, look, this
really is it, okay?

56:06.820 --> 56:08.685
Good luck.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.657
- [Tony] I didn't do it!

56:18.160 --> 56:18.899
- Dad?

56:18.950 --> 56:20.076
- [Tony] Ah, Virginia.

56:20.120 --> 56:22.168
- Dad!

56:22.210 --> 56:23.950
- You won't believe
what's happened to me.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.991
- Don't bet on it.

56:26.050 --> 56:27.620
- Come on.

56:28.840 --> 56:31.673
- Fan out, you guys, fan out!

56:31.720 --> 56:33.005
- Is that the dog
that guy wants?

56:33.050 --> 56:34.290
Why don't you just
give it to him?

56:34.350 --> 56:36.557
- Dad, I don't
think he is a dog.

56:36.600 --> 56:39.558
He's trying to say something,
talk to me or something,

56:39.600 --> 56:42.091
but I can't understand
what he's saying.

56:42.140 --> 56:43.016
- Trying to talk?

56:43.060 --> 56:44.607
- Yeah, I don't know.

56:44.650 --> 56:46.857
- All right, you watch this.

56:46.900 --> 56:48.527
I wish that I could understand

56:48.570 --> 56:51.277
everything this dog is saying.

56:51.320 --> 56:53.447
- What?

56:55.530 --> 56:57.270
- [Wendell] You're
in terrible danger.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.400
Both of you.

56:59.450 --> 57:01.782
- It worked, it worked.

57:01.830 --> 57:03.707
- [Wendell] If you
value your life,

57:03.750 --> 57:05.957
you have to do exactly as I say.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.911
- Listen, shh, what?

57:07.960 --> 57:10.201
- [Wendell] We have
to find the way back.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.581
- He's talking, he's
talking, can't you hear him?

57:12.630 --> 57:13.710
- No.

57:13.760 --> 57:14.294
- [Voiceover] Keep alert.

57:14.340 --> 57:14.999
- Come here.

57:15.050 --> 57:16.176
- What?

57:18.600 --> 57:21.592
(yelling)

57:21.640 --> 57:23.631
- Why are all these
cops after you?

57:23.690 --> 57:25.305
And why are you
wearing handcuffs?

57:25.350 --> 57:26.806
- They think I did a bankjob.

57:26.860 --> 57:27.758
- What?

57:27.820 --> 57:29.014
- I'll explain later.

57:29.070 --> 57:30.810
- [Wendell] Would you
two stop rabbiting

57:30.860 --> 57:32.566
and help me find the mirror?

57:32.610 --> 57:34.601
Now, it's a mirror
but it may not look

57:34.660 --> 57:36.480
like a mirror from
the other side.

57:36.530 --> 57:38.942
You have to look
very, very carefully.

57:38.990 --> 57:40.730
- We're looking
for a magic mirror.

57:40.790 --> 57:43.156
- Yeah, of course we are.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.496
(barking)

57:52.670 --> 57:53.659
- [Wendell] Just
look for a piece

57:53.720 --> 57:55.620
of forest that doesn't fit.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.716
I'm sure this is where...

57:58.600 --> 57:59.885
Look.

57:59.930 --> 58:02.171
There it is.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.765
- That's weird.

58:05.810 --> 58:08.301
- There they are!

58:11.480 --> 58:13.562
- If you value your
lives, follow me.

58:16.820 --> 58:19.732
- Uh, uh, come on.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.667
(gasping)

58:34.590 --> 58:37.468
- I don't know but I'm pretty
sure it's not Central Park.

58:37.510 --> 58:39.717
- [Wendell] Follow me.

58:40.850 --> 58:42.670
- The dog said follow him.

58:47.940 --> 58:50.147
- [Wendell] Hurry up.

58:52.610 --> 58:57.445
(whimsical orchestral music)

59:06.620 --> 59:08.747
- What happened to everybody?

59:08.790 --> 59:09.825
- [Wendell] Well, the same thing

59:09.880 --> 59:12.201
that happened to you, old chap.

59:12.250 --> 59:14.411
Troll dust.

59:14.460 --> 59:16.257
- It_ looks like it's
starting to wear off.

59:16.300 --> 59:18.461
- Is that dog talking again?

59:19.800 --> 59:22.291
- Come on, come on.

59:28.310 --> 59:31.473
- So, what shall we do when
we have our own kingdom?

59:31.520 --> 59:33.932
- Ah, I know, I know.

59:33.980 --> 59:36.813
We'll have servants,
thousands and thousands

59:36.860 --> 59:39.738
of servants to polish our shoes.

59:39.780 --> 59:41.691
- Dad, let's go home.

59:41.740 --> 59:43.116
- No, I can't go back yet.

59:43.160 --> 59:44.696
Police are all over Central
Park looking for me.

59:44.740 --> 59:46.571
- Well, we can't stay here.

59:46.620 --> 59:48.611
- [Wendell] Shh, I
can smell the trolls.

59:48.660 --> 59:50.662
- He says he can smell trolls.

59:52.960 --> 59:54.541
- We'll have footwear
parties where you

59:54.590 --> 59:57.411
have to change shoes
six times an hour.

59:57.460 --> 59:59.712
- And anyone found
having dirty shoes

59:59.760 --> 1:00:01.796
will have their face sewn up.

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:04.217
(laughing)

1:00:11.350 --> 1:00:13.682
- [Wendell] Come
along, then, follow me.

1:00:13.730 --> 1:00:14.856
- Whoa, no, hold on a second.

1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:15.969
I'm not going to follow you.

1:00:16.030 --> 1:00:17.065
Where are we?

1:00:17.110 --> 1:00:18.520
- [Wendell] Ugh.

1:00:18.570 --> 1:00:20.891
We're in the southernmost
part of my kingdom,

1:00:20.950 --> 1:00:25.569
where I was attacked by my
stepmother and turned into a dog.

1:00:25.620 --> 1:00:27.406
This is the Snow White Memorial

1:00:27.450 --> 1:00:29.498
Prison, housing
the most dangerous

1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:31.917
criminals in all
the nIne kingdoms.

1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:34.337
- All right, back
up, the nine what?

1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:35.620
- [Wendell] Kingdoms.

1:00:35.670 --> 1:00:39.629
I am Prince Wendell, grandson
of the late Snow White

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:42.833
and soon-to-be-crowned
king of the fourth kingdom.

1:00:42.890 --> 1:00:45.506
And who might you be?

1:00:45.550 --> 1:00:47.848
- I'm Tony Lewis, janitor.

1:00:47.890 --> 1:00:50.302
I think you already know
my daughter Virginia.

1:00:50.350 --> 1:00:52.807
- The "Troll Kingdom."

1:00:53.940 --> 1:00:57.012
"Red Riding Hood Forest," wow.

1:00:57.070 --> 1:00:58.719
- Wait, hold on a second.

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.099
So what is this?

1:01:00.150 --> 1:01:02.311
It's Cinderella, Sleeping
Beauty fairy tale stuff?

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:03.657
(sighs)

1:01:03.700 --> 1:01:06.328
- [Wendell] Well, the
golden age was almost

1:01:06.370 --> 1:01:09.612
200 years ago when the
ladies you refer to

1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:12.618
had their great
moments in history.

1:01:12.670 --> 1:01:15.571
Things have gone downhill
a bit since then.

1:01:15.630 --> 1:01:18.747
"Happy ever after" didn't
last as long as we'd hoped.

1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:22.416
All the rulers of
the other kingdoms

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:25.428
are due to attend my coronation.

1:01:25.470 --> 1:01:28.212
Some will have to
travel great distances.

1:01:28.260 --> 1:01:30.672
The kingdoms are vast.

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:34.474
No one crosses_ the borders
except on specral occasnons.

1:01:36.110 --> 1:01:38.931
- Who was the stepmother
who turned you into a dog?

1:01:38.980 --> 1:01:43.485
- [Wendell] She is the most
dangerous and evil woman alive.

1:01:43.530 --> 1:01:45.316
- Sounds like my mother-in-law.

1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:47.863
- [Wendell] Look, we can't
sit around talking all day.

1:01:47.910 --> 1:01:50.071
We must find my
stepmother's cell.

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:52.076
This way.

1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:54.156
- Virginia, he said follow him.

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:56.576
Come on, come on.

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:16.642
(powers down)

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.264
- [Wendell] Look.

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:22.436
There's a dog bow! down here.

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:25.028
That's the dog
that's got my body.

1:02:25.070 --> 1:02:26.810
Oh, it's outrageous.

1:02:26.860 --> 1:02:28.612
What did she do, this woman?

1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:30.946
She poisoned my
mother and father.

1:02:30.990 --> 1:02:33.117
Tried to kill me, as well.

1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:35.151
- Basically, poisoned
his mom and dad

1:02:35.210 --> 1:02:36.859
and tried to kill him, too.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.662
Virginia, are you all right?

1:02:39.710 --> 1:02:42.372
I, I feel weird being in here.

1:02:42.420 --> 1:02:43.660
You okay?

1:02:43.710 --> 1:02:47.259
Yeah, I'm just going to
wait outside for a minute.

1:02:47.300 --> 1:02:49.291
- [Wendell] Trolls
have been here.

1:02:49.340 --> 1:02:51.308
- Okay, just don't
go too far, okay?

1:02:51.350 --> 1:02:53.841
Stay outside the door.

1:02:56.980 --> 1:02:58.516
(laughs)

1:02:59.730 --> 1:03:01.436
Virginia!

1:03:03.570 --> 1:03:06.277
Prince, Prince, Prince.

1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:07.560
- [Wendell] I wasn't scared.

1:03:07.610 --> 1:03:09.908
It's just that people mustn't
see me as a dog, Antony.

1:03:09.950 --> 1:03:12.327
It's deeply, deeply
embarrassing.

1:03:12.370 --> 1:03:15.362
- I could care less
about you being a dog.

1:03:15.410 --> 1:03:18.413
Virginia, Virginia!

1:03:18.460 --> 1:03:20.576
- Where are they?

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:22.530
I never should have trusted
trolls to do anything.

1:03:22.590 --> 1:03:24.410
- Be careful what you say.

1:03:24.460 --> 1:03:25.700
I'm the only reason you got out

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:27.546
of prison in the first place.

1:03:27.590 --> 1:03:29.501
- Of course, Your
Majesty, and for that

1:03:29.550 --> 1:03:33.463
I'm eternally grateful but I
can't stay here any longer.

1:03:33.510 --> 1:03:35.842
No one must see the
Prince like this.

1:03:35.890 --> 1:03:37.426
(barking)

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:43.437
Have your children bring the
dog to me when they return.

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:45.471
- I am not your lackey.

1:03:45.530 --> 1:03:47.646
I am Relish, the Troll King.

1:03:47.690 --> 1:03:50.488
You will do well to remember it.

1:03:50.530 --> 1:03:51.861
- Of course, Your Majesty.

1:03:51.910 --> 1:03:54.697
And I will reward you
handsomely with half

1:03:54.740 --> 1:03:56.992
of Wendell's kingdom
as I promised.

1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:01.659
- Just exactly when do I get it?

1:04:01.710 --> 1:04:03.621
- Soon.

1:04:03.670 --> 1:04:04.659
But now I must go.

1:04:04.710 --> 1:04:07.122
I have stayed too long already.

1:04:07.170 --> 1:04:08.501
(panﬁng)

1:04:08.550 --> 1:04:10.586
Oh, get in the carriage.

1:04:10.630 --> 1:04:11.756
- Where are you going?

1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:14.041
There's nowhere you can hide.

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:15.499
When they find
out you've escaped

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.380
there will be
roadblocks everywhere.

1:04:17.430 --> 1:04:20.638
They'll search every house
and carriage in the kingdom.

1:04:20.690 --> 1:04:23.227
- Not every carriage.

1:04:23.270 --> 1:04:28.105
(sweeping orchestral music)

1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:43.077
- Shouldn't we go
back for the dog?

1:04:43.130 --> 1:04:44.199
- No, we can't.

1:04:44.250 --> 1:04:46.377
The troll dust will
be wearing off.

1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:47.296
(ringing)

1:04:47.340 --> 1:04:48.796
Wait a minute, do you hear that?

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.296
They're all waking up.

1:04:50.340 --> 1:04:51.671
Let's get out of here.

1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:53.256
- Oh, the Queen
will be very angry.

1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:56.007
- Aw, the Queen can suck
an elf for all I care.

1:04:56.050 --> 1:04:58.553
We've captured the witch
from the 10th kingdom.

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.136
Let's go tell Dad.

1:05:00.180 --> 1:05:01.477
- But what about
the witch's father?

1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:03.056
Perhaps he's a great warlock.

1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:04.761
- Oh, he's handcuffed.

1:05:04.810 --> 1:05:06.516
- A great idiot, more likely.

1:05:06.570 --> 1:05:07.514
(laughs)

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:09.356
- I wish I could be
there when the governor

1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:11.186
finds him in the Queen's cell.

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:12.810
(laughs)

1:05:13.780 --> 1:05:14.656
- What are you doing?

1:05:14.700 --> 1:05:16.327
I can't fight.

1:05:16.370 --> 1:05:18.156
- It was some kind of spell.

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:20.156
Me and the lads been
laid up for over a day.

1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:21.656
I've searched every
inch of the prison

1:05:21.710 --> 1:05:24.497
but the Queen's gone, sir.

1:05:27.540 --> 1:05:32.375
- I have been the governor
of this prison for 12 years.

1:05:33.630 --> 1:05:37.464
No prisoner has
ever escaped before.

1:05:39.060 --> 1:05:41.267
- That's a very
impressive record.

1:05:41.310 --> 1:05:42.629
- [Wendell] Whatever
you do, Antony,

1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:44.341
don't tell him I'm a dog.

1:05:44.390 --> 1:05:45.596
- Why not?

1:05:45.650 --> 1:05:46.969
- Speak when you're spoken to.

1:05:47.020 --> 1:05:49.648
- [Wendell] Because the Queen
has got some terrible plan.

1:05:49.690 --> 1:05:51.487
My whole kingdom
may be in jeopardy.

1:05:51.530 --> 1:05:54.738
No one must know I'm helpless.

1:05:54.780 --> 1:05:57.237
- All right.

1:05:57.280 --> 1:05:59.692
Where is the Queen?

1:06:00.740 --> 1:06:01.866
I wish I was home.

1:06:01.910 --> 1:06:03.366
I wish Virginia and I were back

1:06:03.410 --> 1:06:06.322
in our apartment
in New York now.

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:11.161
- Well, it seems you're not.

1:06:11.210 --> 1:06:13.121
(coughing)

1:06:14.630 --> 1:06:16.120
(gagging)

1:06:17.220 --> 1:06:18.710
(gagging)

1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:20.000
(spits)

1:06:21.010 --> 1:06:23.228
(soft boinging)

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:27.896
- [Wendell] Oh, no, Antony.

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:31.478
You didn't swallow a dragon
dung bean, you moron.

1:06:31.530 --> 1:06:33.486
- I guess that means I've
had all my wishes, huh?

1:06:33.530 --> 1:06:35.600
- How did the Queen escape?

1:06:35.650 --> 1:06:37.197
- I'm telling you,
I have no idea.

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:40.573
- Then why were you found
locked in her empty cell?

1:06:40.620 --> 1:06:41.905
- I am an innocent victim.

1:06:44.660 --> 1:06:46.571
- Then why are you
wearing handcuffs?

1:06:46.620 --> 1:06:48.747
- Well, because I'm
wanted for armed robbery

1:06:48.790 --> 1:06:50.872
which I didn't have
anything to do with either.

1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:52.490
- [Wendell] Oh,
carry on, Antony.

1:06:52.550 --> 1:06:55.007
You're doing
spectacularly well so far.

1:06:55.050 --> 1:06:56.790
- Look, look, I'm from
a different dimension.

1:06:56.840 --> 1:06:58.137
I_came here from a
different dimen5|on

1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:01.638
led by that dog, who is
actually Prince Wendell.

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:03.671
- [Wendell] Oh, I told
you not to say that.

1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:06.632
- Prince Wendell?

1:07:08.270 --> 1:07:12.183
Look, I can make you break rocks

1:07:12.230 --> 1:07:15.563
with your teeth for 100 years.

1:07:15.610 --> 1:07:17.737
(clinking)

1:07:17.780 --> 1:07:19.566
- I'm telling you,
it's the truth.

1:07:19.610 --> 1:07:21.362
- That is the Queen's dog.

1:07:21.410 --> 1:07:22.525
She has been
permitted to keep him

1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:24.286
in her cell for three years.

1:07:24.330 --> 1:07:26.491
Don't insult my intelligence.

1:07:26.540 --> 1:07:28.280
- I'm not, I'm telling
you, it's the tru--

1:07:28.330 --> 1:07:30.286
All right, fine, I'll prove it.

1:07:30.330 --> 1:07:31.661
Bark once if I'm
telling the truth.

1:07:31.710 --> 1:07:34.452
- [Wendell] I have no
intention of barking, Antony.

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:36.661
- He is being just stubborn.

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:38.460
Listen, you have to
let me go immediately.

1:07:38.510 --> 1:07:40.637
I think my daughter
was abducted by trolls.

1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:41.465
(Slap)

1:07:41.510 --> 1:07:43.057
- That's enough.

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:45.671
I'll get the truth out
of you soon enough.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.018
Warder, remove his handcuffs.

1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:50.972
Issue him with prison
uniform and put him in,

1:07:51.020 --> 1:07:55.434
uh, yes, put him
in 103 with Acorn

1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:59.735
the dwarf and Clay
Face the goblin.

1:07:59.780 --> 1:08:01.316
- Clay Face the goblin?

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:03.612
I don't want to be put in
any room with Clay Face...

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:04.695
No!

1:08:04.740 --> 1:08:06.867
Where's my daughter?

1:08:06.910 --> 1:08:08.650
- What about the
Queen's dog, Sir?

1:08:08.710 --> 1:08:10.917
- Get the furnace going.

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:13.497
I'll slip some rat poison
in his dinner tonight,

1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:17.909
and we'll chuck him in
the Incmerator tomorrow.

1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:20.835
- [Wendell] Did you hear that?

1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:24.099
Antony, did you hear that?

1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:26.347
You have to get me out.

1:08:26.390 --> 1:08:29.097
It's your duty.

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:34.055
(discordant tribal music)

1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:39.599
- Get her in the boat.

1:08:39.650 --> 1:08:41.311
Get her in there.

1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:42.440
- Hey, that's my boat.

1:08:42.490 --> 1:08:43.366
- It's ours now.

1:08:43.410 --> 1:08:44.399
(Punch)

1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:48.536
Now, let's get out of here.

1:08:48.580 --> 1:08:51.617
(yelling)

1:08:56.290 --> 1:08:58.258
Sit down and steer.

1:09:00.050 --> 1:09:02.336
(yelling)

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:15.509
- [Jailor] Middle bunk.

1:09:19.570 --> 1:09:24.018
(soft snoring)

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:40.082
- [Acorn] So, what
are you in for?

1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:47.713
- Um, actually, a pretty
serious bank robbery.

1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:52.838
Couple of people got hurt
but that's the way it goes.

1:09:55.190 --> 1:09:56.475
And you?

1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:59.182
- Aggravated assault.

1:09:59.230 --> 1:10:01.733
I'm very easily aggravated.

1:10:03.650 --> 1:10:05.561
I'm Acorn.

1:10:05.610 --> 1:10:07.487
Got any metal on ya?

1:10:07.530 --> 1:10:10.078
Knives, forks?

1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:11.906
Coat hangers?

1:10:11.950 --> 1:10:13.747
- Sorry.

1:10:13.790 --> 1:10:16.827
- If you get stabbed...

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:19.531
Save the knife
for me, won't you?

1:10:20.590 --> 1:10:22.581
- Of course.

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:29.541
- [Clay Face] Do
you like carving?

1:10:32.850 --> 1:10:36.308
- Well, not flesh or anything.

1:10:36.350 --> 1:10:39.513
- [Clay Face] Look
what I'm doing.

1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:41.608
- Ah.

1:10:42.650 --> 1:10:45.642
You've got real talent.

1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:56.748
- My name's Clay
Face, the goblin.

1:10:57.750 --> 1:10:59.490
- Tony.

1:11:00.460 --> 1:11:02.291
What are you in for?

1:11:02.340 --> 1:11:04.046
- Carving.

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:08.541
Will you be my friend?

1:11:11.550 --> 1:11:14.348
- What exactly does that entail?

1:11:14.390 --> 1:11:15.470
- [Bluebell] Row!

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:16.976
[Blabberwort] When we're home,

1:11:17.020 --> 1:11:18.556
I'm going to let you have it.

1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:19.589
- Keep rowing.

1:11:19.650 --> 1:11:20.890
- I'm rowing.

1:11:20.940 --> 1:11:25.525
(fastpaced tribal music)

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:38.495
(light cheerful music)

1:11:44.210 --> 1:11:45.450
- Any minute now.

1:11:45.510 --> 1:11:47.831
I'm sure _Princ_e
Wendell wrll arrIve

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:50.383
to receive the coronation throne

1:11:50.430 --> 1:11:52.751
which our craftsmen
have tirelessly

1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:55.598
spent the last two years making.

1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:57.631
- He's not coming, is he?

1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:00.342
- Of course he is.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.721
Have no worry.

1:12:02.770 --> 1:12:06.228
I'm sure he's been delayed
for a very good reason.

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:07.395
- Horrible news.

1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:09.317
There's been a breakout
from the prison.

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:10.600
The Queen has escaped.

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:11.775
- The Queen?

1:12:11.820 --> 1:12:13.117
- The Queen.

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.570
- Put up the roadblocks.

1:12:14.620 --> 1:12:16.861
She must be caught
or we're doomed.

1:12:16.910 --> 1:12:18.616
- Oh, hey, wonderful news!

1:12:18.660 --> 1:12:20.241
Wonderful news.

1:12:20.290 --> 1:12:21.416
Prince Wendell is coming.

1:12:21.460 --> 1:12:23.371
- Thank goodness.

1:12:23.420 --> 1:12:25.456
He'll know what to do.

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:30.460
(epic orchestral music)

1:12:33.510 --> 1:12:37.298
(cheering)

1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:47.144
Welcome to Beantown,
Your Majesty.

1:13:08.090 --> 1:13:11.332
- [Wendell] Psst, Antony.

1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:12.620
Over here.

1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:14.671
Behind the governor's door.

1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:16.130
- [Tony] How did
you know it was me?

1:13:16.180 --> 1:13:18.717
- [Wendell] You have a
distinctive unwashed smell.

1:13:18.770 --> 1:13:20.226
What are you doing?

1:13:20.270 --> 1:13:21.510
- I'm scrubbing the floor.

1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:23.016
What do you think I'm doing?

1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:24.596
- [Wendell] Have
you got a soap bar?

1:13:24.650 --> 1:13:25.799
- Well, yes.

1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:27.600
What, do you want
me to wash you?

1:13:27.650 --> 1:13:29.277
- [Wendell] No, just stay there.

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:30.560
Don't go away.

1:13:30.610 --> 1:13:31.986
- Prince...

1:13:40.910 --> 1:13:43.413
- [Wendell] This is the
governor's master key.

1:13:43.460 --> 1:13:45.872
Make an impression in the soap.

1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:48.206
He'll be back any moment.

1:13:58.050 --> 1:13:59.961
- Here.

1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:05.807
Very stubborn stain, sir.

1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:18.826
(ominous instrumental music)

1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:28.707
(caws)

1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:46.432
(howling roar)

1:14:58.910 --> 1:15:00.946
- [Bluebell] Ithink
she's waking up.

1:15:00.990 --> 1:15:02.400
Good morning.

1:15:02.450 --> 1:15:04.577
(laughing)

1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:11.582
- [Burly] Get someone over here.

1:15:29.060 --> 1:15:32.689
- [Prisoners] We promise
to serve Prince Wendell,

1:15:32.730 --> 1:15:36.643
kind and brave monarch
of The Fourth Kingdom,

1:15:36.690 --> 1:15:39.944
and pledge to mend
our naughty ways

1:15:39.990 --> 1:15:44.905
so that we may all live
happily ever after.

1:15:44.950 --> 1:15:47.862
(grumbling)

1:15:54.550 --> 1:15:56.006
- What is this stuff?

1:15:56.050 --> 1:15:57.506
- Baked beanstalk.

1:15:57.550 --> 1:15:59.086
- Baked beans?

1:15:59.130 --> 1:16:00.961
- Beanstalk.

1:16:01.010 --> 1:16:03.217
(gags)

1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:05.888
My god!

1:16:05.930 --> 1:16:06.806
I can't eat that.

1:16:06.850 --> 1:16:08.727
It tastes like an old mattress.

1:16:08.770 --> 1:16:10.726
- No, it doesn't.

1:16:10.770 --> 1:16:14.399
Old mattress has a
sweaty, meaty taste.

1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:17.432
- And how often is
this on the menu?

1:16:17.490 --> 1:16:20.027
- Three times a day.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.441
- That's beanstalk juice.

1:16:25.490 --> 1:16:27.742
Takes a bit of gettin' used to.

1:16:27.790 --> 1:16:29.326
(gags)

1:16:30.290 --> 1:16:32.201
- Listen, um...

1:16:32.250 --> 1:16:33.490
Let's say I wanted
to talk to somebody

1:16:33.540 --> 1:16:36.998
and I wanted to get
something, made.

1:16:37.050 --> 1:16:39.166
For instance, for
the sake of argument,

1:16:39.220 --> 1:16:41.711
a small piece of metal.

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:43.387
Who would I have to talk to?

1:16:43.430 --> 1:16:46.172
I mean, who's Mr.
Big around here?

1:16:46.220 --> 1:16:47.551
- If you want anything
bought, sold, borrowed,

1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:52.264
or made in here, you have
to see the Tooth Fairy.

1:16:53.350 --> 1:16:55.477
- Uh, the who?

1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:57.772
- The prison dentist.

1:16:57.820 --> 1:17:00.106
- Ah.

1:17:00.150 --> 1:17:03.529
Uh, and how would
I get to see him?

1:17:03.570 --> 1:17:05.618
- Oh, um, that's easy.

1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:07.480
Oh, yeah?

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:12.536
(punch)
(yeHs)

1:17:14.460 --> 1:17:16.371
(knocking)

1:17:21.170 --> 1:17:23.468
- Oh, oh, that's no good.

1:17:23.510 --> 1:17:25.421
They'll all have to come out.

1:17:25.470 --> 1:17:26.596
- What do you mean, "come out?"

1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.210
You haven't even
looked in my mouth yet.

1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:29.386
- Sit down.

1:17:29.430 --> 1:17:30.055
- I, I...

1:17:30.100 --> 1:17:32.136
- Come on.

1:17:32.190 --> 1:17:34.556
There, that's it.

1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:36.397
(chuckles)

1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:38.476
There.

1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:40.522
Would you like some candy?

1:17:40.570 --> 1:17:41.525
- What?

1:17:41.570 --> 1:17:42.446
You're a dentist.

1:17:42.490 --> 1:17:44.060
You shouldn't be
giving people candy.

1:17:44.110 --> 1:17:45.099
- Why not?

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:46.525
- Well, because it rots teeth.

1:17:46.570 --> 1:17:47.901
- Ah, rubbish.

1:17:47.950 --> 1:17:49.110
- Well, of course it does.

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:50.320
- Well, excuse me.

1:17:50.370 --> 1:17:52.452
Who is the tooth
extractor here, eh?

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:54.161
You or me?

1:17:54.210 --> 1:17:55.620
- Well, I'm just gonna...

1:17:55.670 --> 1:17:56.785
- What are you doing?

1:17:56.830 --> 1:17:57.990
- I'm just putting
the straps on.

1:17:58.040 --> 1:17:59.792
- Straps, what do
we need straps for?

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:01.796
- Yeah, the straps of comfort.

1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:05.128
Tooth decay is caused
by three things.

1:18:05.180 --> 1:18:07.421
Number one, poor diet.

1:18:07.470 --> 1:18:10.177
Number two, not
brushing properly.

1:18:10.220 --> 1:18:13.018
And number three...

1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:14.687
Bad fairies.

1:18:14.730 --> 1:18:16.049
(groans softly)

1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:17.226
(chuckles dementedly)

1:18:17.270 --> 1:18:19.261
- You know, I, I
think I could, um--

1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:20.526
- Ah, just let...

1:18:20.570 --> 1:18:21.525
- Ah!

1:18:21.570 --> 1:18:22.605
- Does that, does that hurt?

1:18:22.650 --> 1:18:23.560
- Ow, ah!

1:18:23.610 --> 1:18:24.440
Uh huh.

1:18:24.490 --> 1:18:25.479
- Good.

1:18:25.530 --> 1:18:27.270
How about this?

1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:28.366
- Whoa, no.

1:18:28.410 --> 1:18:29.729
Wait a minute...

1:18:29.780 --> 1:18:31.156
(groans sharply)

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.280
No, no!

1:18:32.330 --> 1:18:34.400
- Ah, loose teeth.

1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:36.246
Ithoughtso.

1:18:36.290 --> 1:18:37.370
- Oh...

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.036
- Don't you worry.

1:18:40.090 --> 1:18:43.719
We have a bag of
magic teeth here.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.870
- You can't...

1:18:47.890 --> 1:18:49.539
I came to you for help.

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:50.589
- Help?

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:52.517
- Yeah, I...

1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:56.098
I've got to get a, a
key made out of this.

1:18:57.190 --> 1:18:59.101
- What's it worth?

1:18:59.150 --> 1:19:00.299
- Uh...

1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:02.430
Oh, oh, look, look.

1:19:02.480 --> 1:19:03.435
See that?

1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:04.026
- Oh...

1:19:04.070 --> 1:19:05.185
- Ow!

1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:06.639
This...

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:11.073
Is a hand-worn clock.

1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:12.781
The little hands
go around, and it

1:19:12.830 --> 1:19:15.401
tells the time very intricately.

1:19:15.460 --> 1:19:16.779
I...

1:19:16.830 --> 1:19:19.492
(loud ticking)

1:19:19.540 --> 1:19:22.839
- We call them watches.

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:25.201
- Ah, but this is a Rolex.

1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:26.500
Solid gold.

1:19:26.550 --> 1:19:28.461
- Ah.

1:19:28.510 --> 1:19:31.252
Yeah, well, as long as it's not

1:19:31.300 --> 1:19:33.382
one of those cheap imitations.

1:19:33.430 --> 1:19:35.421
- Oh, aw, hey!

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:38.438
(chatting)

1:19:39.230 --> 1:19:39.798
- Hey, what?

1:19:39.850 --> 1:19:40.930
Hey, look.

1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:42.265
Prince Wendell's carriage.

1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:44.356
- Raise the barrier.

1:19:47.530 --> 1:19:50.272
Your Majesty.

1:19:53.990 --> 1:19:56.197
(barking)

1:20:04.250 --> 1:20:05.410
- Do you mean to
say he just drove

1:20:05.460 --> 1:20:08.418
right through Beantown
without stopping?

1:20:08.470 --> 1:20:09.789
- That was on Wednesday,
Lord Chancellor,

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:11.421
and he hasn't been seen since.

1:20:11.470 --> 1:20:12.630
The throne makers are furious.

1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:14.557
They're threatening to
boycott the coronation.

1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:18.809
- It's so unlike the Prince not
to send word of where he is.

1:20:18.850 --> 1:20:20.898
- Perhaps it's just, uh...

1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:22.896
Coronation nerves.

1:20:22.940 --> 1:20:24.680
I'm sure he'll turn up soon.

1:20:24.730 --> 1:20:28.359
- Let us not forget that the
Evil Queen is now at large.

1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:29.810
- Where is Wendell?

1:20:29.860 --> 1:20:33.523
Where is he in his kingdom's
greatest hour of need?

1:20:33.570 --> 1:20:36.539
- Things look very bad indeed.

1:20:36.580 --> 1:20:37.865
- Terrible.

1:20:37.910 --> 1:20:40.037
- Quite awful!

1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:41.820
- Still...

1:20:41.870 --> 1:20:45.499
I expect it'll all turn
out happy ever after.

1:20:45.550 --> 1:20:47.450
- Oh, yes.

1:20:48.460 --> 1:20:51.008
- Now, to the real crisis.

1:20:51.050 --> 1:20:53.507
There is a shortage of bluebells
throughout the kingdom.

1:20:53.550 --> 1:20:55.347
My color scheme for
the coronation banquet

1:20:55.390 --> 1:20:59.508
will have to be
completely rethought.

1:21:04.650 --> 1:21:07.062
- [Burly] She's awake.

1:21:07.110 --> 1:21:08.429
Strip her.

1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:10.141
(moans softly)

1:21:12.570 --> 1:21:14.777
(yells)

1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:19.826
- Oh my god.

1:21:19.870 --> 1:21:22.998
- You're a captive of
the merciless trolls now.

1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:24.029
- The merciless!

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:25.661
- Without mercy.

1:21:26.710 --> 1:21:27.745
- Ah!

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.540
Pretty little feet.

1:21:29.590 --> 1:21:31.501
Nicey nice.

1:21:31.550 --> 1:21:34.087
- Who runs your kingdom?

1:21:34.140 --> 1:21:35.380
- My kingdom?

1:21:35.430 --> 1:21:36.966
- Who's in charge?

1:21:37.010 --> 1:21:38.671
- Ah, the president!

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:40.051
- Wendell was trying
to rally an army

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:42.056
from your kingdom to attack us.

1:21:42.100 --> 1:21:42.839
Wasn't he?

1:21:42.890 --> 1:21:43.720
- No.

1:21:43.770 --> 1:21:45.306
(yells)

1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:50.398
- This could be_a
long torture sessmn.

1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:51.771
- I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:53.902
- Torture first, then you talk.

1:21:53.950 --> 1:21:55.440
It's better that way.

1:21:55.490 --> 1:21:58.072
Rush a torture, ruin a torture.

1:21:58.120 --> 1:21:59.280
(chuckling)

1:21:59.330 --> 1:22:00.740
(creaking)

1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:04.611
Dad's here.

1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:08.489
- Dad?

1:22:08.540 --> 1:22:10.952
Why don't you take
off the shoes?

1:22:11.010 --> 1:22:13.831
- [Relish] In these
shoes I am all-powerful.

1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:15.507
I can rule the world.

1:22:15.550 --> 1:22:16.380
- [Burly] Come on, Dad.

1:22:16.430 --> 1:22:19.058
Just slip 'em off.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:22.510
Dad!

1:22:29.190 --> 1:22:30.350
- Where have you been?

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:31.890
You're a day late.

1:22:31.940 --> 1:22:33.567
- Uh, well...

1:22:33.610 --> 1:22:34.599
- He, he...

1:22:34.650 --> 1:22:36.527
- Who's this?

1:22:36.570 --> 1:22:38.367
Supposed to bring back the dog.

1:22:38.410 --> 1:22:41.231
- Oh, forget the dog, Dad.

1:22:41.290 --> 1:22:44.077
We've discovered
another kingdom.

1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:46.452
- The mythical 10th kingdom.

1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:48.491
- Talked of only in myth.

1:22:48.540 --> 1:22:49.529
- Don't talk rubbish.

1:22:49.590 --> 1:22:50.830
There is no 10th kingdom.

1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:52.836
- Oh, but there
is, and this witch

1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:55.713
put us in a box of matches.

1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:57.387
- You were captured?

1:22:57.430 --> 1:23:00.638
By this, girl?

1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:02.090
- She's a witch.

1:23:02.140 --> 1:23:03.300
- How many of their
soldiers did you

1:23:03.350 --> 1:23:05.557
kill before you were captured?

1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:06.555
- None.

1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:09.398
- None survived.

1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:12.352
- Who wants to be whipped first?

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:14.732
- It's true.

1:23:14.780 --> 1:23:17.351
Look at this.

1:23:25.370 --> 1:23:27.952
Gimme that night fever

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.491
We know how to show it

1:23:30.540 --> 1:23:33.794
- They are called
the Brothers Gibb.

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:36.798
- And the song, it
concerns a deadly fever

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:40.219
that only strikes on Saturdays.

1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:44.263
- There's more to all this

1:23:44.310 --> 1:23:47.131
than the Queen is telling me.

1:23:47.180 --> 1:23:52.106
(adventurous instrumental music)

1:24:12.540 --> 1:24:14.121
- Prince, I've got the key.

1:24:14.170 --> 1:24:15.546
- [Wendell] Oh, brilliant.

1:24:15.590 --> 1:24:16.545
The governor's in the kitchen

1:24:16.590 --> 1:24:19.172
making me another poison dinner.

1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:20.756
Quick, use it now.

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:23.348
Open the door.

1:24:23.390 --> 1:24:24.755
There are spare
uniforms in here.

1:24:24.810 --> 1:24:26.129
You can put one on and,

1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:27.727
and just march me
out of the prison.

1:24:27.770 --> 1:24:29.681
Oh, come on, hurry up.

1:24:29.730 --> 1:24:31.550
- Shh, somethings
wrong with the key.

1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:33.648
It's not turning.

1:24:36.110 --> 1:24:38.351
Must be a...

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:41.449
- You must really love pain.

1:24:41.490 --> 1:24:42.479
- What?

1:24:42.530 --> 1:24:43.986
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

1:24:44.030 --> 1:24:45.327
I, I was just coming down
the hall and I tripped

1:24:45.370 --> 1:24:47.326
on the loose brick,
and I fell and I found

1:24:47.370 --> 1:24:49.247
myself right here in front of
your door and I found this.

1:24:49.290 --> 1:24:50.575
Did you lose one?

1:24:50.620 --> 1:24:53.669
- Take him downstairs and
give him 50 beanstalk lashes.

1:24:53.710 --> 1:24:55.120
Right now.

1:24:55.170 --> 1:24:57.240
- No, no, you know,
that's not necessary.

1:24:57.300 --> 1:24:59.416
I was coming by to ask you,
do you have a laundry here?

1:24:59.470 --> 1:25:00.585
- [Wendell] Oh, dear.

1:25:00.630 --> 1:25:03.508
Sorry about that, Antony.

1:25:03.550 --> 1:25:06.553
- [Tony] No, listen, I don't...

1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:08.386
- Here boy.

1:25:08.430 --> 1:25:09.727
Here, boy.

1:25:09.770 --> 1:25:13.012
- [Tony] You're hurting me.

1:25:13.060 --> 1:25:16.439
- Here you are, doggy.

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:18.357
There.

1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:22.359
That should give you
a nice, long sleep.

1:25:25.870 --> 1:25:27.485
(whip cracks)
(yells)

1:25:29.450 --> 1:25:30.747
(whip cracks)
(yells)

1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:33.166
(whip cracks)
(yells)

1:25:34.250 --> 1:25:35.490
(whip cracks)
(yells)

1:25:36.460 --> 1:25:37.415
(whip cracks)
(yells)

1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:39.199
(whip cracks)

1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:40.966
- [Tony] Ouch!

1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:52.512
- You will dance for me
and when you've finished

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:57.304
dancing you'll tell me how
to invade your kingdom.

1:25:59.900 --> 1:26:01.276
- Uh, you know, I'm not,

1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:02.810
I'm not much of
a dancer, really.

1:26:02.860 --> 1:26:04.851
Actually.

1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:09.941
- You'll dance when
you wear these.

1:26:14.620 --> 1:26:17.168
(sizzling)

1:26:17.210 --> 1:26:19.337
Wake me when they turn red.

1:26:22.630 --> 1:26:25.372
(creaking)

1:26:30.510 --> 1:26:32.216
(sniffs)

1:26:33.270 --> 1:26:36.808
- Conceal the coach then
prepare a room for the Prince.

1:26:36.850 --> 1:26:37.976
- Welcome home.

1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:39.601
We have missed
you, Your Majesty.

1:26:39.650 --> 1:26:44.519
(soft ominous music)

1:26:53.290 --> 1:26:54.359
(door closes)

1:26:57.580 --> 1:26:59.207
- [Dog] Who's that?

1:27:00.460 --> 1:27:03.509
- She was the stepmother
who poisoned Snow White

1:27:03.550 --> 1:27:06.758
with the apple all
those years ago.

1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:10.342
She was once the
most powerful woman

1:27:10.390 --> 1:27:13.177
in all the nine
kingdoms and this

1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:16.348
was but one of her five castles.

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:19.352
- What happened to her?

1:27:20.610 --> 1:27:24.273
- When she was ﬁnally
caught, they heated

1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:28.313
a pair of iron slippers
over red-hot coals

1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:32.569
and made her dance at
Snow White's wedding.

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:37.239
She crawled _out into the
snow, dragging her raw,

1:27:37.290 --> 1:27:41.954
blistered, useless feet
into a swamp nearby.

1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:46.418
This broken woman
was once the fairest

1:27:46.470 --> 1:27:50.918
of them all, but
she kept her magic

1:27:50.970 --> 1:27:55.339
mirrors and searched
for a successor

1:27:55.390 --> 1:27:59.224
and that, of course, was me.

1:28:05.530 --> 1:28:09.443
I will finish her
work and destroy

1:28:09.490 --> 1:28:13.074
the House of White
forever, and pity

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:16.578
the fool who tries
to stand up to me!

1:28:16.620 --> 1:28:19.282
(epic orchestral music)

1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:24.451
("Wishing on a Star"
by Anne Dudley)

1:28:24.500 --> 1:28:28.334
I'm wishing on a star

1:28:31.140 --> 1:28:34.348
To follow where you are

1:28:37.810 --> 1:28:41.473
I'm wishing on a dream

1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:48.399
To follow what it means

1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:55.575
And I wish on all the rainbows

1:28:55.620 --> 1:28:58.077
That I've seen

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:00.748
I wish on all the people

1:29:00.790 --> 1:29:04.908
Who really dream
