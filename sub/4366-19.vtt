00:02.190 --> 00:04.575
You are being watched.

00:04.577 --> 00:06.878
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.880 --> 00:11.332
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.334 --> 00:13.834
I know because I built it.

00:13.836 --> 00:16.152
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:16.155 --> 00:18.089
but it sees everything...

00:18.091 --> 00:20.791
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:20.793 --> 00:22.260
people like you.

00:22.262 --> 00:25.963
Crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.965 --> 00:29.317
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:29.319 --> 00:31.269
But I needed a partner...

00:31.271 --> 00:33.888
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:33.890 --> 00:38.142
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:38.144 --> 00:40.027
You will never find us.

00:40.029 --> 00:42.012
But victim or perpetrator,

00:42.014 --> 00:45.232
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:52.474 --> 00:54.492
Sometimes I wonder
what kind of man I'd be

00:54.494 --> 00:57.194
if she hadn't been killed.

00:57.196 --> 01:00.298
I hear people change
when they lose a parent,

01:00.300 --> 01:02.800
especially when that parent
is murdered.

01:08.340 --> 01:09.640
Ah.

01:09.642 --> 01:11.926
Big test today, right?

01:11.928 --> 01:13.210
I always hated algebra.

01:13.212 --> 01:17.565
All those Xs a Ys
made my head spin.

01:17.567 --> 01:20.051
I don't mind it so much.

01:20.053 --> 01:22.052
Hey, you wanna talk about it?

01:22.054 --> 01:25.940
- It's no big deal.
- It seems like it might be.

01:25.942 --> 01:28.025
It's just some rich d-bag's
giving me a hard time

01:28.027 --> 01:30.394
- for being on scholarship.
- I wanna know who they are.

01:30.396 --> 01:31.779
- No way.
- Taylor.

01:31.781 --> 01:33.731
Last thing I need
is you fighting my battles.

01:33.733 --> 01:36.417
I'm not some little kid.

01:36.419 --> 01:38.703
I'll take the subway
home tonight.

01:38.705 --> 01:40.237
I know you're working late.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.706
Pad thai for dinner?

01:41.708 --> 01:44.608
Yeah.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.243
Have a good day, okay?

01:53.252 --> 01:54.251
Carter.

01:54.253 --> 01:55.853
It's Lablanca in SID.

01:55.855 --> 01:57.588
You ready for me
to make your day?

01:57.590 --> 01:59.473
You're about to tell me
I won a paid vacation

01:59.475 --> 02:01.442
- to Hawaii?
- Almost as good.

02:01.444 --> 02:04.528
You know those accounts
you thought belonged to Elias?

02:04.530 --> 02:06.230
The ones we traced
to that investment firm

02:06.232 --> 02:07.264
a few weeks ago?

02:07.266 --> 02:08.532
When you flagged
those accounts,

02:08.533 --> 02:10.618
they had a balance
of $4 million.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.437
As of this morning, not a dime.

02:13.439 --> 02:17.107
Elias drained them, Carter.
All of them.

02:17.109 --> 02:20.127
I'll be there in ten minutes.

02:24.449 --> 02:26.467
Bit of a late start,
Mr. Reese.

02:26.469 --> 02:28.252
Did you forget
to set your alarm?

02:28.254 --> 02:30.588
Had my yoga class.

02:32.174 --> 02:35.009
Well, I hope you've
gotten in touch with your chi

02:35.011 --> 02:36.811
because it seems
we have a big day ahead of us.

02:36.813 --> 02:39.030
We received five numbers
this morning.

02:39.032 --> 02:41.015
Hm, bumper crop.

02:41.017 --> 02:43.133
Meet the heads
of the five families.

02:43.135 --> 02:44.835
Caparelli.

02:44.837 --> 02:46.837
Zambrano.
Grifoni.

02:46.839 --> 02:47.872
Basile.

02:47.874 --> 02:49.106
Gianni Moretti Jr.

02:49.108 --> 02:50.524
Moretti's son.

02:50.526 --> 02:52.927
Junior took over when Moretti
went to prison.

02:52.929 --> 02:54.478
Unless all these men
suddenly decided

02:54.480 --> 02:56.480
to turn on one another,

02:56.482 --> 02:59.417
I think it's fair to assume
that they're being targeted.

02:59.419 --> 03:01.202
Short list of people
crazy enough to take on

03:01.204 --> 03:03.838
the entire leadership
of the Cosa Nostra.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.990
Only one, in my opinion.

03:05.992 --> 03:07.792
Elias.

03:07.794 --> 03:10.010
He's already
kidnapped his father.

03:10.012 --> 03:11.595
Eliminate the remaining dons,

03:11.597 --> 03:13.997
he could control
the entire mafia.

03:13.999 --> 03:16.183
I don't know, Finch.

03:16.185 --> 03:19.270
We could let the trash
take out the trash.

03:19.272 --> 03:21.522
I know they encouraged
a certain moral flexibility

03:21.524 --> 03:23.524
when you worked
at the CIA, Mr. Reese,

03:23.526 --> 03:25.059
but I like to think
that we're reaching

03:25.061 --> 03:27.461
for a higher standard.

03:27.463 --> 03:28.863
In any case,

03:28.865 --> 03:31.031
we need to consider
the collateral damage.

03:31.033 --> 03:34.285
So we're going to babysit
the five most powerful criminals

03:34.287 --> 03:35.319
in New York.

03:35.321 --> 03:36.871
How do we get close to them?

03:36.873 --> 03:38.689
These gentlemen
meet once a month

03:38.691 --> 03:40.241
at the Covenant Club
in Brooklyn.

03:40.243 --> 03:41.792
There are no cameras
allowed inside

03:41.794 --> 03:44.578
the private meeting room,
and no cell phones.

03:44.580 --> 03:47.381
Not gonna be easy
to spy on these guys.

03:47.383 --> 03:49.467
Not even for you, Finch.

03:49.469 --> 03:52.503
That sounds like a challenge,
Mr. Reese.

03:54.273 --> 03:57.591
The club recently installed
a new fire alarm system.

03:57.593 --> 04:00.010
In case of emergency,
fire fighters could communicate

04:00.012 --> 04:03.097
with anyone trapped inside
through a sound system.

04:03.099 --> 04:07.050
But any speaker can be converted
to a crude microphone

04:07.052 --> 04:09.770
by reversing polarity.

04:09.772 --> 04:12.072
Those idiots from the
Department of Homeland Security,

04:12.074 --> 04:13.941
they can't even
take a bribe right.

04:13.943 --> 04:16.076
That shipment was half
of what it was supposed to be.

04:16.077 --> 04:17.495
What are we gonna do with it?

04:17.497 --> 04:19.146
Nice work, Finch.

04:20.366 --> 04:21.899
We'll step on it
more than usual.

04:21.901 --> 04:23.200
If the customers complain,

04:23.202 --> 04:25.736
they can put a note
in our suggestion box.

04:26.906 --> 04:29.006
You kidding me with this?

04:29.008 --> 04:31.325
Business as usual
like nothing's changed?

04:31.327 --> 04:34.011
We're all very sorry
for your father's situation,

04:34.013 --> 04:35.012
Junior.

04:35.014 --> 04:36.046
Situation?

04:36.048 --> 04:37.765
My father's probably dead.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.633
I wanna know what the family's
gonna do to retaliate

04:39.635 --> 04:41.352
against this Elias.

04:41.354 --> 04:43.020
You mean your half-brother?

04:43.022 --> 04:44.772
Your old man brought this
on himself.

04:44.774 --> 04:47.057
He sired a little bastard
and then he had the poor taste

04:47.059 --> 04:48.893
to have the mother bumped off.

04:48.895 --> 04:50.444
That's a filthy lie.

04:50.446 --> 04:52.146
No disrespect, Junior.

04:52.148 --> 04:54.732
We don't care if you bring
Elias over for Thanksgiving.

04:54.734 --> 04:56.367
He's a player,
brings in a lot of cash.

04:56.369 --> 04:59.320
You wanna work with a man
that you know is robbing you?

04:59.322 --> 05:01.372
And stealing our territories?

05:01.374 --> 05:03.874
It's a business, kid.
It's not a love affair.

05:03.876 --> 05:05.442
We work with him,

05:05.444 --> 05:07.294
we all get rich.

05:07.296 --> 05:08.996
We need to convey
to these gentlemen

05:08.998 --> 05:11.448
that Elias won't be interested
in making a deal.

05:11.450 --> 05:15.553
I think it's time
to update Detective Carter.

05:15.555 --> 05:18.806
That could be difficult,
since she's not speaking to us.

05:18.808 --> 05:22.092
An apology might
go a long way, Mr. Reese.

05:30.853 --> 05:32.486
If Elias
moved all of his money,

05:32.488 --> 05:34.304
where did it go?

05:34.306 --> 05:35.806
I don't know yet.

05:35.808 --> 05:39.159
The funds went out
to over 1,000 unique payees.

05:39.161 --> 05:41.311
Did you get any names
of the people he paid?

05:41.313 --> 05:42.529
It's not that easy.

05:42.531 --> 05:44.148
Yeah, it never is
with this guy.

05:44.150 --> 05:47.268
Everything's going out
as cash or wire transfers.

05:47.270 --> 05:48.953
We could trace it,
but the warrants alone

05:48.955 --> 05:50.221
would take a couple weeks.

05:50.223 --> 05:51.839
What do you think he's buying?

05:51.841 --> 05:53.924
Elias doesn't care
about material things.

05:53.926 --> 05:54.992
He buys people.

05:54.994 --> 05:57.428
People who'll murder for money.

05:57.430 --> 06:00.214
Cops and politicians
who'll look the other way.

06:00.216 --> 06:03.684
Well, whatever it is,
he just bought a lot of it.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:14.029 --> 06:16.363
You'll have to eat
with your hands.

06:16.365 --> 06:19.166
I remember you were pretty good
with a knife back in the day.

06:19.168 --> 06:21.368
They called you
"the blade," right?

06:21.370 --> 06:25.155
I never understood
your generation and...

06:25.157 --> 06:27.091
The ridiculous nicknames.

06:27.093 --> 06:29.426
You spent too much time
growing fat.

06:29.428 --> 06:31.745
Soft.

06:31.747 --> 06:33.914
Some of them even tried
to turn the family legit,

06:33.916 --> 06:35.132
like your son.

06:35.134 --> 06:38.652
I mean, your real son.

06:38.654 --> 06:41.889
Why don't you
just kill me already?

06:48.212 --> 06:52.399
I would hate for you
to miss the show.

06:52.401 --> 06:54.601
I'm gonna do what you
never had the stones to.

06:54.603 --> 06:57.021
I'm gonna unite the families,
and take control.

06:57.023 --> 07:01.442
Oh, that's some plan
for a nobody.

07:01.444 --> 07:03.994
And you think my associates
are gonna go along

07:03.996 --> 07:07.781
with this farce?

07:07.783 --> 07:09.500
They won't have a choice.

07:09.502 --> 07:11.535
Besides, I never learned
how to share.

07:11.537 --> 07:12.870
My mother might have taught me,

07:12.872 --> 07:15.923
but she didn't
get the chance, did she?

07:28.219 --> 07:31.171
45 minutes to Queens?
I got a real job, you know.

07:31.173 --> 07:34.558
HR is your real job, Fusco.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.110
I need some intel on that guy

07:36.112 --> 07:37.811
who's been stirring things up
around town.

07:37.813 --> 07:39.596
Tall guy with a suit.

07:39.598 --> 07:41.365
Likes shooting people
in the kneecaps.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.233
I thought
he was yesterday's news.

07:43.235 --> 07:44.735
Not to the feds.

07:44.737 --> 07:48.105
They set up a new task force
trying to locate him.

07:48.107 --> 07:51.125
We wanna know
everything they do,

07:51.127 --> 07:52.826
see if we can
get to him ourselves.

07:52.828 --> 07:55.546
Why, you looking
to put him on the payroll?

07:55.548 --> 07:57.648
You ask a lot
of questions, Fusco.

07:57.650 --> 08:01.451
I got an inquisitive mind.

08:01.453 --> 08:03.504
We're doing a job for Elias.

08:03.506 --> 08:06.974
Since when does HR
work for Elias?

08:06.976 --> 08:09.126
We don't work for anybody.

08:09.128 --> 08:11.895
We lend a hand
when it's in our best interest.

08:11.897 --> 08:14.932
Right now that's Elias.

08:16.484 --> 08:18.435
When you're done
looking into that matter,

08:18.437 --> 08:20.187
I'd call in sick.

08:20.189 --> 08:23.524
You don't wanna be working
Homicide next couple of days.

08:30.448 --> 08:33.650
Are you certain this
is the best course of action?

08:33.652 --> 08:36.904
Mafiosi don't take kindly
to people who approach them...

08:36.905 --> 08:38.488
Unannounced.

08:38.490 --> 08:40.707
They're like feral dogs
that way.

08:40.708 --> 08:43.493
No time for anything
but the direct approach, Finch.

08:43.495 --> 08:47.381
Besides, I've always
been good with dogs.

08:50.001 --> 08:51.268
What are you, lost?

08:51.270 --> 08:53.937
I'm here to give you
a heads up about Elias.

08:53.939 --> 08:55.522
He's got plans.

08:55.524 --> 08:57.558
And they don't include you
and your friends.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.010
- You a cop?
- Not even close.

09:00.012 --> 09:01.228
Frankly, I'd be inclined

09:01.230 --> 09:03.730
to let you idiots
kill each other,

09:03.732 --> 09:05.816
but that could get messy.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.484
Your men here
can't protect you.

09:07.486 --> 09:09.987
But I can.
If you come with me.

09:09.989 --> 09:12.623
Thanks for your concern,
my friend, but...

09:12.625 --> 09:15.859
I don't need your help.

09:30.558 --> 09:33.177
I struck out, Finch.
Caparelli wouldn't listen to me.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.023
What happened, Mr. Reese?

09:46.025 --> 09:47.891
Elias got to him, Finch.

09:47.893 --> 09:51.161
You were right
about collateral damage.

10:15.196 --> 10:17.331
I wish they were dead.
All of them.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.033
- What happened, Carl?
- They started it.

10:20.035 --> 10:23.220
Calling me names.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.757
Ms. Beecher told me
you never turned in

10:26.759 --> 10:28.476
your term project.

10:28.478 --> 10:31.011
That's 'cause it was stupid.

10:31.013 --> 10:33.681
Is this it?

10:36.501 --> 10:39.904
- I'm not a bastard.
- Is that why you fought them?

10:39.906 --> 10:42.656
Who called you that?

10:42.658 --> 10:45.392
Come on, I'll help you
fill out the rest.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.995
With what?
It's for family.

10:47.997 --> 10:50.998
Well, Carl Elias, you got me.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.500
And your foster sisters.

10:52.502 --> 10:54.568
I had a mother.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.921
She's gone.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.006
Maybe we could
do some research,

10:59.008 --> 11:01.342
find some more names
to fill in.

11:01.344 --> 11:03.093
Like my father?

11:03.095 --> 11:05.012
Oh, h-honey...

11:05.014 --> 11:07.515
You must have heard something
about him, who he was--

11:07.517 --> 11:10.250
Carl, do me a favor.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.352
Let it go.

11:11.354 --> 11:13.721
Do you think he even knows

11:13.723 --> 11:16.757
about what happened to my mom?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.726
Here's what I know, baby.

11:18.728 --> 11:21.695
We are all descended from kings.

11:21.697 --> 11:24.365
You gotta live your own life.

11:24.367 --> 11:26.534
Be your own man.

11:26.536 --> 11:27.952
You understand?

11:42.752 --> 11:45.252
I was wondering
when you'd call, John.

11:45.254 --> 11:48.172
I heard you witnessed the
tragedy earlier this afternoon.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.257
I hope you weren't hurt
from the explosion.

11:50.259 --> 11:52.426
Elias...

11:52.428 --> 11:54.812
End this before
anyone else gets hurt.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.264
I'm only doing what I think
is best for the city.

11:57.266 --> 11:59.984
So you're gonna kill
everyone who gets in the way?

11:59.986 --> 12:02.152
We're more alike
than you'd like to admit.

12:02.154 --> 12:05.439
Both killers in our own right.

12:05.441 --> 12:07.691
But now you save innocent people
like Charlie Burton,

12:07.693 --> 12:09.142
not old gangsters.

12:09.144 --> 12:11.195
Just leave those men to me.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.314
You know I can't do that.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.466
I can't say I'm surprised.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.151
See you on the other side.

12:18.153 --> 12:21.005
We have another problem.
Detective Carter.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.374
I thought she wasn't
answering her calls.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.658
She wasn't.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.012
But as you know,
I've always taken

12:28.014 --> 12:30.931
a somewhat liberal view
of how to use a telephone.

12:30.933 --> 12:33.851
She knows that Elias
is up to something.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.669
After Caparelli's murder,
she started reaching out

12:35.671 --> 12:38.022
to the remaining dons,
offering them police protection.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.306
She doesn't know that Elias

12:39.308 --> 12:41.341
is planning to take them
all out at once.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.144
Or that he's got HR's backing.

12:44.146 --> 12:47.448
I need her location.
Now.

13:02.631 --> 13:04.298
You come with me.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.166
The rest of you
lock down both ends of the block

13:06.168 --> 13:09.386
until we get this guy
out of here, understood?

13:12.874 --> 13:14.475
Who are we bringing in,
Detective?

13:14.477 --> 13:15.726
Don Basile.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.511
He's going into
protective custody

13:17.513 --> 13:20.764
until we can take down Elias.

13:21.850 --> 13:23.383
- You Carter?
- Yeah.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.070
How am I supposed to know
you're not on Elias's payroll?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.220
You can't.

13:27.222 --> 13:29.389
You got another option,
I recommend you take it.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.192
Otherwise, let's move.

13:32.194 --> 13:35.579
All right, come on, come on.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.956
Detective...

13:45.958 --> 13:47.374
Where'd everyone go?

13:47.376 --> 13:48.742
Get back.

13:50.379 --> 13:52.429
- Unh!
- Get back!

14:09.263 --> 14:12.533
You really should
return your calls, Detective.

14:29.814 --> 14:31.848
Those new bootleg CDs, boss.

14:31.850 --> 14:34.601
We got a whole bunch more
in Lou's trunk.

14:34.603 --> 14:36.269
Hold on a second, kid.

14:36.271 --> 14:37.937
I'd like a word, please.

14:37.939 --> 14:40.273
Maybe I should stay, pop.

14:40.275 --> 14:41.991
Go home, tell your mother
I already ate.

14:41.993 --> 14:44.077
But, pop,
I was just thinking--

14:51.619 --> 14:53.286
You came to us
through Lou, right?

14:53.288 --> 14:55.004
That's right, sir.

14:55.006 --> 14:57.040
Thing is, I don't know
much about you, kid,

14:57.042 --> 14:58.425
but you look familiar.

14:58.427 --> 15:02.045
Along with the name.
Elias.

15:02.047 --> 15:05.231
I think you know what I mean.

15:05.233 --> 15:08.184
My mother
was Marlene Elias, sir.

15:08.186 --> 15:09.602
I thought so.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.337
Beautiful woman.

15:11.339 --> 15:14.107
I've been told that, sir.

15:14.109 --> 15:17.176
I thought about
when this day might come.

15:17.178 --> 15:19.479
What I would say to you.

15:21.015 --> 15:25.017
What are you doing here, kid?
What do you want from me?

15:25.019 --> 15:27.620
I just want a job, sir.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.956
A chance to learn
from the best.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.708
To prove myself.

15:31.710 --> 15:35.578
You know where diamonds
come from, kid?

15:35.580 --> 15:37.029
Starts out as carbon.

15:37.031 --> 15:40.116
Black as coal,
buried miles beneath the earth.

15:40.118 --> 15:43.202
Takes pressure,
temperatures hotter than hell.

15:43.204 --> 15:45.255
Billions of years,
until a volcano

15:45.257 --> 15:46.840
blows it to the surface.

15:46.842 --> 15:50.760
That is the only way
to form a diamond.

15:50.762 --> 15:53.396
Never heard that before.

15:53.398 --> 15:55.732
I didn't know my father either.

15:55.734 --> 15:57.600
I survived.

15:57.602 --> 16:00.219
I didn't know that, sir.

16:00.221 --> 16:03.406
But...

16:03.408 --> 16:07.494
You're here because
you figured some things out.

16:07.496 --> 16:10.230
So now you and me,

16:10.232 --> 16:14.734
we have our own little secret.

16:14.736 --> 16:16.870
They tell me
you got a pair, kid.

16:16.872 --> 16:18.121
Tenacious.
Capable.

16:18.123 --> 16:21.374
- I like to think so, sir.
- You keep your head up.

16:21.376 --> 16:24.577
There's a place for you here.

16:25.846 --> 16:28.247
Thank you, sir.

16:34.087 --> 16:36.890
So nice to finally meet you.

16:52.373 --> 16:54.374
The officer's stable.

16:54.376 --> 16:57.794
Lucky for us,
you got good timing.

16:57.796 --> 17:00.547
I guess you should know,
the FBI has a new task force

17:00.549 --> 17:02.081
set up in your honor.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.650
They think
you're working with Elias.

17:03.652 --> 17:06.019
I'm often misunderstood.

17:13.126 --> 17:14.844
I take it things
didn't go as expected

17:14.846 --> 17:16.963
with Mr. Basile.

17:16.964 --> 17:19.232
I don't know
who to trust anymore.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.983
You can trust us...

17:20.986 --> 17:24.988
Detective.

17:24.990 --> 17:29.141
Elias transferred $4 million
in the past 48 hours

17:29.143 --> 17:31.945
to a dozen cash and carry hubs
around the city.

17:31.947 --> 17:33.830
We could use those transfers
to track down

17:33.832 --> 17:36.115
the men working for him, but...

17:36.117 --> 17:39.018
I can't access their database
without a warrant.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.587
Maybe I could use...

17:40.589 --> 17:42.121
Other techniques...

17:42.123 --> 17:43.706
To access the information
we need.

17:43.708 --> 17:46.042
If we track down
the men on Elias's payroll,

17:46.044 --> 17:48.661
they may lead us right to him.

17:48.663 --> 17:50.346
In the meantime,

17:50.348 --> 17:52.015
I need to convince
those old Dons

17:52.017 --> 17:53.666
that the only way to stay alive

17:53.668 --> 17:58.304
is to work with us.

17:58.306 --> 18:00.523
Thanks for the backup.

18:00.525 --> 18:02.525
If I'm not there next time...

18:05.013 --> 18:09.032
I want you to be prepared.

18:14.856 --> 18:16.906
Not exactly standard issue.

18:16.908 --> 18:18.875
Should I ask
where you got these?

18:18.877 --> 18:22.211
Probably best if you don't.

18:46.103 --> 18:47.820
You getting shipped
back to Iraq or something?

18:47.822 --> 18:49.439
I need an assist.

18:49.441 --> 18:51.874
Did you bring the extra vest
and ammo like I told you?

18:51.876 --> 18:54.494
Yeah.

18:54.496 --> 18:55.945
Just get in.

18:55.947 --> 19:00.066
You're the only cop
I can trust right now.

19:04.672 --> 19:06.089
Who am I looking at, Finch?

19:06.091 --> 19:08.741
I was able to trace
the financial transactions

19:08.743 --> 19:11.044
coming out of Elias's accounts.

19:11.046 --> 19:13.513
The man you're following
is one of the recipients.

19:13.515 --> 19:15.198
Elias's payroll reads

19:15.200 --> 19:19.802
like a <i>who's who</i>
of the US penal system.

19:19.804 --> 19:21.253
I'm following him.

19:21.255 --> 19:22.805
But who's he following?

19:22.807 --> 19:24.524
It's a family.

19:24.526 --> 19:25.892
Any idea who they are?

19:25.894 --> 19:27.810
Maybe they're related
to the Dons.

19:27.812 --> 19:30.363
Elias isn't above
threatening their loved ones.

19:30.365 --> 19:32.031
Right theory.

19:33.068 --> 19:34.651
Wrong organization.

19:34.653 --> 19:37.103
Elias's people are following
HR families, Finch.

19:37.105 --> 19:38.538
I don't understand
his strategy.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.039
HR are his allies.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.792
In war, you need
to be able to coerce your allies

19:42.794 --> 19:44.377
every bit as much
as your enemies.

19:44.379 --> 19:46.329
Which means if any
of his law enforcement contacts

19:46.331 --> 19:49.082
gets out of line,
he has a backup plan.

19:49.084 --> 19:51.951
That's what I would do.

19:51.953 --> 19:53.836
If you had listened to me
to begin with

19:53.838 --> 19:57.590
we could have gotten him
before he went after my father.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.643
Detectives.

20:00.645 --> 20:02.979
What's so important you
bully your way into our club?

20:02.981 --> 20:04.564
You're going
into protective custody

20:04.566 --> 20:06.315
until we can find Elias.

20:06.317 --> 20:08.568
I don't think so.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.136
It's not really
up for discussion.

20:10.138 --> 20:12.321
You've failed
to control this man.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.490
Some of you tried
to cut deals with him.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.743
And now he's coming after you.

20:16.745 --> 20:19.362
I'm not gonna stand by
and let innocent civilians

20:19.364 --> 20:21.914
get killed because
you chose to ignore

20:21.916 --> 20:25.168
what was right in front
of your nose.

20:25.170 --> 20:27.804
Jimmy!

20:27.806 --> 20:31.090
Come show the detectives out.

20:33.761 --> 20:38.197
What are you, sleeping?

20:38.199 --> 20:39.832
Jimmy!

20:39.834 --> 20:43.002
Looks like your boys
abandoned you.

20:43.004 --> 20:46.172
You wanna bet Elias's men
aren't far behind?

20:46.174 --> 20:49.475
We don't work with cops.

20:49.477 --> 20:52.395
You don't wanna
come voluntarily,

20:52.397 --> 20:54.280
we're gonna take you by force.

20:54.282 --> 20:55.448
What are you gonna shoot us?

20:55.450 --> 20:57.183
If I shoot you,
then maybe Elias

20:57.185 --> 21:00.369
won't have to blow up
a carload of innocent people.

21:00.371 --> 21:02.739
Hey, shouldn't
we call for backup?

21:02.741 --> 21:06.259
You are my backup.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.042
Here come Elias's guys.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.053
Hello?

21:34.055 --> 21:37.073
It's for you.

21:37.075 --> 21:38.407
Hello?

21:38.409 --> 21:41.627
Turn left and go two blocks
to 954 President Street.

21:41.629 --> 21:43.062
You got good timing.

21:43.064 --> 21:44.947
- Next left, Fusco.
- Go to the second floor.

21:44.949 --> 21:48.751
- The code is 3288.
- Got it.

22:09.089 --> 22:10.606
Who owns this place again?

22:10.608 --> 22:13.192
A friend.

22:13.194 --> 22:16.562
You got some weird friends,
Carter.

22:23.036 --> 22:25.104
I don't remember
a lot about my mom.

22:25.106 --> 22:27.690
I was four when she died.

22:27.692 --> 22:29.225
Of course, you know that.

22:29.227 --> 22:32.128
But every so often
I get these images of her,

22:32.130 --> 22:37.250
especially
when I smell her perfume.

22:37.252 --> 22:40.553
Shalimar, I think.

22:41.922 --> 22:44.957
She had dark hair.

22:44.959 --> 22:46.609
Kind eyes.

22:46.611 --> 22:50.930
Other times
I just see the blood.

22:50.932 --> 22:54.150
Just so much blood
from such a small person.

22:59.406 --> 23:01.107
There was a problem, boss.

23:01.109 --> 23:03.326
The detective--
The one you wanted gone.

23:03.328 --> 23:04.493
Mm-hm.

23:04.495 --> 23:06.362
She took him.

23:06.364 --> 23:09.782
- Which one?
- All of them.

23:09.784 --> 23:12.501
I see.

23:12.503 --> 23:14.086
We'll need our friends
on the police force

23:14.088 --> 23:17.456
to join us on this one.

23:31.071 --> 23:33.472
Detectives Carter and Fusco
are both safe and sound

23:33.474 --> 23:35.174
at one of my properties,
Mr. Reese.

23:35.176 --> 23:37.343
As are the remaining Dons.

23:37.345 --> 23:38.694
Good to hear, Finch.

23:38.696 --> 23:40.479
How'd she convince him
to go with her?

23:40.481 --> 23:42.365
She didn't.
She kidnapped them.

23:42.367 --> 23:43.699
It seems you've had something

23:43.701 --> 23:45.067
of an influence on her,
Mr. Reese.

23:45.069 --> 23:46.352
Thanks, Finch.

23:46.354 --> 23:48.321
I'm not certain
I meant that as a compliment.

23:48.323 --> 23:50.907
Elias isn't gonna
take this lying down, Finch.

23:50.909 --> 23:52.909
No sign of him yet,
but I've tracked down

23:52.911 --> 23:54.526
a dozen of his men.

23:54.528 --> 23:57.663
All positioned to strike
against the families of HR cops

23:57.665 --> 23:59.582
if things don't go his way.

23:59.584 --> 24:01.584
Luckily HR doesn't know
where the Dons are.

24:01.586 --> 24:04.203
Only Carter and Fusco do.

24:04.205 --> 24:05.721
Finch...

24:05.723 --> 24:08.224
The men that we're tracking...

24:08.226 --> 24:11.043
Are any of them near
Marbury High School in Brooklyn?

24:17.101 --> 24:18.401
Yes, why?

24:18.403 --> 24:20.937
That's where Carter's son
goes to school.

24:27.277 --> 24:30.496
What was the accident?
Is my mom gonna be all right?

24:30.498 --> 24:32.031
It's too soon to tell.

24:32.033 --> 24:35.284
But I'll take you
right to the hospital.

24:52.864 --> 24:54.314
- Hello?
- Taylor?

24:54.316 --> 24:56.099
You don't know me,
but you are in danger

24:56.101 --> 24:58.118
and I want you
to stay inside the school

24:58.120 --> 25:01.572
with a teacher
until we can get to you.

25:01.574 --> 25:02.689
Taylor?

25:02.691 --> 25:05.942
Just keep quiet,
and you won't get hurt.

25:08.414 --> 25:12.449
Hey, I need to see your pass!

25:12.451 --> 25:14.167
Unh!

25:18.506 --> 25:20.957
Ooh!

25:38.192 --> 25:40.360
How long you think
we can stay here?

25:40.362 --> 25:42.946
Until we know they're safe.

25:42.948 --> 25:44.615
They're mob bosses, Carter.

25:44.617 --> 25:46.667
That ain't gonna happen
any time soon.

25:49.488 --> 25:50.704
You've gotta be kidding me.

25:50.706 --> 25:53.340
How did Elias' men find us?

25:53.342 --> 25:57.828
- I thought you shook them off.
- I did, we were free and clear.

26:00.214 --> 26:01.832
What do you have?

26:01.834 --> 26:03.767
Carter, I need
to tell you something.

26:03.769 --> 26:07.387
You've gotta know I'm not gonna
let anything happen to him.

26:07.389 --> 26:08.772
You understand?
I'll find him.

26:08.774 --> 26:12.059
Find who?
What's going on, John?

26:15.313 --> 26:16.897
Taylor?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.590
Taylor.

26:19.984 --> 26:23.520
You got a great kid here,
Detective.

26:28.743 --> 26:31.361
I swear to God, if you
touch him I'll kill you.

26:31.363 --> 26:34.214
You have the means
to set him free.

26:34.216 --> 26:35.882
You can't call for backup.

26:35.884 --> 26:37.867
Who you gonna trust anymore?

26:37.869 --> 26:40.721
You know I can't
hand these guys over to you.

26:40.723 --> 26:42.506
I might as well
kill them myself.

26:42.508 --> 26:44.725
If you're up to it,
that would be extremely helpful.

26:44.727 --> 26:47.427
Why do you need
the bosses dead, Elias?

26:47.429 --> 26:51.264
You've already shown
how powerful you are.

26:51.266 --> 26:53.066
You don't understand
the evil you're protecting,

26:53.068 --> 26:54.551
do you?

26:54.553 --> 26:56.386
Let me tell you something
about Zambrano.

26:56.388 --> 26:58.188
He earns his living
by selling heroin

26:58.190 --> 27:00.607
to schoolchildren.

27:00.609 --> 27:02.859
Grifoni sells guns
to the highest bidder.

27:02.861 --> 27:04.528
My esteemed half-brother,

27:04.530 --> 27:06.330
a man who
not only imports drugs,

27:06.332 --> 27:07.664
but young girls.

27:07.666 --> 27:09.700
These are the men
that you are protecting.

27:09.702 --> 27:12.402
Things would be much better
under your watch, huh?

27:12.404 --> 27:14.121
I run an efficient enterprise.

27:14.123 --> 27:16.573
There's no infighting,
there's no conflict

27:16.575 --> 27:17.841
over territory.

27:17.843 --> 27:21.345
I am the evolution
of organized crime.

27:21.347 --> 27:25.799
You're a force
of corruption and weakness.

27:25.801 --> 27:27.718
My answer is no.

27:33.692 --> 27:37.227
He wants to trade Taylor
for the Dons.

27:37.229 --> 27:39.529
- How can I do that?
- You can't.

27:39.531 --> 27:43.984
But you don't have to make that decision,
'cause I'm gonna get your son back,

27:43.986 --> 27:46.236
no matter what the cost.

27:46.238 --> 27:47.937
I won't let anyone hurt him.

27:47.939 --> 27:49.623
You hear me, Carter?

27:49.625 --> 27:51.074
Promise me.

27:51.076 --> 27:53.610
You have my word.

27:53.612 --> 27:57.414
Finch, I need you to tell me
where to find the boy.

27:57.416 --> 27:59.499
I'm a step ahead of you,
Mr. Reese.

27:59.501 --> 28:01.334
The only way to locate Taylor
is to make a deal

28:01.336 --> 28:02.586
with the devil.

28:02.588 --> 28:04.838
I hope you're not referring
to Elias.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.807
Elias isn't
the only fallen angel

28:06.809 --> 28:09.309
in our rolodex, Mr. Reese.

28:19.136 --> 28:22.189
You okay, Carter?

28:22.191 --> 28:25.409
They got my kid.

28:27.311 --> 28:29.012
You sure not calling backup's
the way to go here?

28:29.014 --> 28:31.031
You don't get it, Fusco.

28:31.033 --> 28:32.699
You see those two in the suits?

28:32.701 --> 28:35.035
They work Vice at the 15th.

28:35.037 --> 28:38.588
They're here to help Elias,
not back us up.

28:38.590 --> 28:41.007
What do you wanna do?

28:41.009 --> 28:44.327
Wait.

28:44.329 --> 28:47.013
Make sure this place
is sealed off.

28:47.015 --> 28:48.331
Okay.
I'll do a sweep,

28:48.333 --> 28:49.999
and make sure it's airtight.

28:57.225 --> 28:59.893
You should have been our
wheel-man, Detective Carter.

28:59.895 --> 29:01.645
I don't think your partner
had it in him.

29:01.647 --> 29:03.814
Don't go blaming Fusco,
this isn't on him.

29:03.816 --> 29:06.015
You sure about that?

29:06.017 --> 29:09.453
Because I got
this vague recollection...

29:09.455 --> 29:11.521
That your partner
used to be on the take.

29:11.523 --> 29:13.206
In fact now that
I think about it,

29:13.208 --> 29:14.825
I'm sure of it.

29:14.827 --> 29:18.695
He was partners with that,
uh, Detective Stills, right?

29:18.697 --> 29:20.547
That dirty cop who went missing

29:20.549 --> 29:22.866
a few months back?

29:22.868 --> 29:25.252
Those guys had their paws
around every game in town.

29:25.254 --> 29:26.837
All of them on the take.

29:26.839 --> 29:28.138
And they didn't care
because they'd just

29:28.140 --> 29:29.673
throw a piece upstairs,
you know.

29:29.675 --> 29:33.727
Shaking down low-life
drug dealers, pimps,

29:33.729 --> 29:36.313
whatever scratch
they could get.

29:36.315 --> 29:39.566
They even did some wet work.

29:44.772 --> 29:48.224
Hello, Detective.

29:48.226 --> 29:50.644
I've come to talk it over
in person.

29:50.646 --> 29:54.781
Are you ready
to pick the right side?

30:05.376 --> 30:07.928
Hello, Officer Simmons.

30:07.930 --> 30:11.431
I wonder if I might have
a few minutes of your time.

30:11.433 --> 30:14.601
Who the hell are you?

30:28.946 --> 30:33.598
You gonna tell me who you are
or do I have to arrest you?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.800
I'd like to talk to you
about your organization.

30:35.802 --> 30:38.436
The one commonly referred to
as HR.

30:38.438 --> 30:41.106
It's come to my attention
that HR has been paid

30:41.108 --> 30:43.558
a large sum of money to ignore

30:43.560 --> 30:47.145
any criminal activities
involving a man named Elias.

30:47.147 --> 30:49.864
Really.

30:49.866 --> 30:54.435
And how exactly did this
come to your attention?

30:54.437 --> 30:56.738
I notice things, Officer.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.490
Things the rest
of the world ignores.

30:58.492 --> 31:00.659
And I've noticed things
about Elias

31:00.661 --> 31:02.577
that I believe
you've overlooked.

31:02.579 --> 31:03.878
I doubt that.

31:03.880 --> 31:07.415
I'm a pretty
observant guy myself.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.117
You think Elias
stands for a return

31:09.119 --> 31:10.902
to the way things used to be.

31:10.904 --> 31:13.672
A firm hand on the reins
of organized crime.

31:13.674 --> 31:16.725
But he also stands
for other things.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.965
This is Elias's surveillance
of HR police officers

31:23.967 --> 31:25.817
and their families.

31:25.819 --> 31:29.070
You're in bed with the devil.

31:29.072 --> 31:30.855
This man will go to any length
to get what he wants,

31:30.857 --> 31:32.857
including kidnapping children.

31:32.859 --> 31:38.113
Detective Carter's son
is only his most recent victim.

31:38.115 --> 31:40.832
I didn't hear
anything about that.

31:40.834 --> 31:43.335
Look, I recognize, Officer,
that I'm placing myself

31:43.337 --> 31:45.987
in danger by sitting here
with you.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.789
I need you to understand
that you're placing

31:47.791 --> 31:51.042
your family in danger
by doing business with Elias.

31:53.346 --> 31:54.763
What the hell is this?

31:54.765 --> 31:56.998
The man following your wife
is an ex-con

31:57.000 --> 32:02.303
whose prior convictions
include rape, manslaughter...

32:02.305 --> 32:05.357
Elias is keeping
you and yours in check...

32:05.359 --> 32:06.691
Until his plan is finished.

32:06.693 --> 32:08.693
After that...

32:08.695 --> 32:12.063
Who knows whether
he'll have any use for you.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.786
How do I know this guy
doesn't work for you, huh?

32:17.788 --> 32:19.988
I imagine you don't.

32:19.990 --> 32:23.875
But are you really willing
to bet your family's life on it?

32:28.363 --> 32:29.547
What do you want?

32:29.549 --> 32:30.749
You need to get me the location

32:30.751 --> 32:32.384
of Detective Carter's son and

32:32.386 --> 32:34.469
call of any men you have
working on Elias's behalf.

32:34.471 --> 32:38.840
HR severs its ties with Elias
as of this moment.

32:51.520 --> 32:55.240
Not gonna wait
all night, Detective.

32:55.242 --> 32:56.390
Let him go, Elias.

32:56.392 --> 32:58.076
He's got no part in this.

32:58.078 --> 32:59.944
Taylor seems like
a very nice young man.

32:59.946 --> 33:02.697
I'd rather not hurt him.

33:02.699 --> 33:04.365
You need to accept the fact

33:04.367 --> 33:07.619
that no one's coming
to save you-- You are all alone.

33:38.784 --> 33:42.036
I think-- Uh, I think
it's right up over here.

33:42.038 --> 33:43.538
Ooh, colder than a witch's nip

33:43.540 --> 33:46.124
in a brass bra.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.459
Where's Don Moretti?

33:47.461 --> 33:49.244
Yeah, you tell me, kid.

33:49.246 --> 33:51.746
Well, uh, the boss
wanted me to tell you

33:51.748 --> 33:54.132
he wished he could be here...

33:54.134 --> 33:55.917
But he couldn't make it.

33:55.919 --> 33:59.637
- Come on.
- Talk about brass.

33:59.639 --> 34:02.891
Used to be the Dons
would clean up their own mess.

34:02.893 --> 34:05.126
Moretti didn't have the stones
to be here.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.011
You know, Deluca told me
he made him get rid

34:07.013 --> 34:10.098
of the broad back in the day.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.985
Now we gotta deal
with this miserable bastard.

34:13.987 --> 34:16.137
Aw, for crying out loud.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.355
Here come the waterworks.

34:17.357 --> 34:18.773
What's the matter, kid?

34:18.775 --> 34:21.809
Not the family reunion
you were hoping for?

34:21.811 --> 34:23.444
What an idiot,
I should have known.

34:23.446 --> 34:25.947
Yeah, well, the Don's
already got one idiot kid.

34:25.949 --> 34:27.481
Guess he didn't
need another one.

34:31.454 --> 34:36.291
You two think you're safe
because there's just one of me.

34:36.293 --> 34:41.262
That I'm weak
and that you're strong.

34:41.264 --> 34:42.931
That's not strength.

34:42.933 --> 34:45.099
That's weakness.

34:45.101 --> 34:50.221
Look at you...
A bunch of jealous idiots.

34:50.223 --> 34:53.056
Liars, betraying each other.

34:54.177 --> 34:57.695
I don't need that.

34:57.697 --> 35:00.532
I get my strength
from being alone,

35:00.534 --> 35:02.901
and that's why
I'm gonna destroy all of you.

35:02.903 --> 35:06.287
Shut him up already, will ya?

35:06.289 --> 35:07.539
Unh!

35:07.541 --> 35:09.457
Come on, help me out!
Little bastard!

35:09.459 --> 35:11.709
Unh!

35:40.606 --> 35:42.824
This is where
they're holding Taylor.

35:42.826 --> 35:44.409
What's your plan, John?

35:44.411 --> 35:45.827
No plan.

35:47.163 --> 35:48.913
I'll just take
the direct approach.

35:48.915 --> 35:52.083
I'm sorry I'm not much use
on this end of things.

35:52.085 --> 35:53.901
Look...

35:53.903 --> 35:56.120
Show me how to fire one of these
and I can help.

35:56.122 --> 35:57.372
I'll...

35:57.374 --> 35:59.591
Create a distraction,
I suppose, or...

35:59.593 --> 36:03.011
That's okay, Harold.

36:03.013 --> 36:05.013
You can be the getaway driver.

36:05.015 --> 36:06.881
I'll be fine.

36:06.883 --> 36:08.800
Besides, you know
I don't like it

36:08.802 --> 36:12.103
when people mess with kids.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.696
Last chance, Detective.

36:21.698 --> 36:24.899
Those immoral, corrupt men
or your innocent son.

36:32.374 --> 36:33.774
No deal.

36:33.776 --> 36:36.327
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying right here.

36:36.329 --> 36:38.663
They're not getting past me.

36:38.665 --> 36:42.500
I'm not as alone as you think!

36:50.976 --> 36:52.760
Unh!

36:59.402 --> 37:04.355
♪ I have earned my tomorrows ♪

37:04.357 --> 37:06.741
♪ and my dreams all fade away ♪

37:36.555 --> 37:39.140
Aah!

38:05.501 --> 38:07.635
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38:07.637 --> 38:09.637
Who are you?

38:09.639 --> 38:11.589
My name is John.

38:11.591 --> 38:14.058
Your mother sent me.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.930
You here to rescue me?

38:18.932 --> 38:20.714
Or shoot me?

38:20.716 --> 38:22.350
Tonight...

38:22.352 --> 38:24.352
Rescue.

38:35.114 --> 38:36.197
Hey, Carter.

38:36.199 --> 38:37.898
Those HR cops just took off.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.401
Keep the Dons in the back.

38:40.403 --> 38:43.755
Hey, you heard the lady.
Get back.

38:43.757 --> 38:47.074
Open the door, Detective.

38:47.076 --> 38:48.960
I should have known.

38:48.962 --> 38:51.763
All that nonsense about
bringing Elias into the fold.

38:51.765 --> 38:54.515
You're an embarrassment!
A rat!

38:54.517 --> 38:56.217
Elias offered me a deal.

38:56.219 --> 38:57.918
When change comes,
you gotta adapt.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.055
You and your old man,
you never learned that lesson.

39:01.057 --> 39:02.273
Drop it, Zambrano.

39:02.275 --> 39:04.692
Not until you
let me out of here.

39:04.694 --> 39:06.694
You should have given Elias
everything he wanted

39:06.696 --> 39:08.095
like the rest of them.

39:08.097 --> 39:10.031
I don't look the other way.

39:10.033 --> 39:11.616
Yeah, but your partner does.

39:11.618 --> 39:12.817
Right...

39:12.819 --> 39:14.902
Fusco?

39:14.904 --> 39:16.770
You see, in less than 30 seconds
there's a guy

39:16.772 --> 39:18.105
that's gonna
come into this room

39:18.107 --> 39:20.074
that's gonna run this city.

39:20.076 --> 39:21.742
You're a survivor.

39:21.744 --> 39:23.294
You gonna choose
the right side?

39:23.296 --> 39:28.382
Or are you gonna die
alone here with your partner?

39:42.965 --> 39:46.684
Not one more step, Elias.

39:46.686 --> 39:49.070
Tell your boys
to put down their weapons...

39:49.072 --> 39:52.406
Or their day will end
like Zambrano's over here.

39:52.408 --> 39:53.858
You're good
at your job, Detective.

39:53.860 --> 39:55.276
I'm good at mine.

39:55.278 --> 39:56.911
I was hoping we could
avoid further bloodshed.

39:56.913 --> 39:58.312
This is where it ends.

39:58.314 --> 40:01.415
Right here, right now.

40:03.453 --> 40:04.752
I called for backup.

40:09.825 --> 40:12.176
You gotta trust somebody,
Carter.

40:12.178 --> 40:15.496
This guy doesn't own every cop.

40:19.051 --> 40:21.335
Get down, get down!

40:23.690 --> 40:27.308
Carl Elias,
you are under arrest.

40:27.310 --> 40:30.611
I'll have to check my notes
for the list of charges,

40:30.613 --> 40:33.447
but murder and kidnapping
are at the top.

40:33.449 --> 40:36.684
You can't stop the inevitable,
Detective.

40:36.686 --> 40:39.153
Change will happen
whether you embrace it or not.

40:39.155 --> 40:41.956
He was my father.

40:41.958 --> 40:43.524
You're dead.

40:43.526 --> 40:45.243
No one's ever gonna
remember you even existed!

40:45.245 --> 40:46.460
You're nothing, you hear me?

40:50.416 --> 40:52.366
- Talk to me.
- Mom, it's me.

40:52.368 --> 40:55.052
Taylor.
Are you okay?

40:55.054 --> 40:58.139
That guy you sent
is kind of a bad-ass.

40:58.141 --> 41:00.925
Yeah, he knows it too.

41:00.927 --> 41:02.126
Who's the guy with the glasses?

41:02.128 --> 41:05.229
If you find out, let me know.

41:05.231 --> 41:07.381
Where are you?

41:07.383 --> 41:09.734
I'm safe.

41:09.736 --> 41:11.051
I'll see you soon.

41:11.053 --> 41:14.221
Okay.

41:36.679 --> 41:38.082
You're okay...

41:44.636 --> 41:47.588
Good to know
you keep your promises.

41:47.590 --> 41:50.524
I told you I'd never let
anything happen to your son.

41:50.526 --> 41:53.194
Thank you.

42:14.399 --> 42:15.666
Birth date?

42:15.668 --> 42:18.552
August 18, 1965.

42:18.554 --> 42:20.004
Social Security number?

42:20.006 --> 42:23.758
306-00-3894.

42:24.862 --> 42:26.434
It's good
to have you back, pop.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.289
It's good to be back.

42:32.053 --> 42:33.655
Let's go home, son.

42:51.254 --> 42:52.486
Hello?

42:52.488 --> 42:54.005
Hi, dad.

42:54.007 --> 42:57.291
What, is this somehow
supposed to intimidate me?

42:57.293 --> 43:00.461
I just wanted
to say good-bye...

43:00.463 --> 43:03.664
And that I wish
I could have been there.
