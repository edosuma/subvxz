18:32.190 --> 18:34.092
EITHER THAT OR
HE'S PROBABLY SAYING,
"I TOLD YOU SO,"

18:34.192 --> 18:35.413
'CAUSE HE HAS, LIKE,
THIS WHOLE THEORY

18:35.513 --> 18:36.654
ABOUT THE WINDS
BEING CURSED

18:36.754 --> 18:38.376
OR, LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW,

18:38.476 --> 18:40.298
MAKING PEOPLE ACT
OUT OF CHARACTER.

18:40.398 --> 18:42.260
I MEAN, YOU DID
ASK ME ON A DATE.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.062
THAT'S PRETTY
UNCHARACTERISTIC.

18:44.162 --> 18:46.705
YEAH. OH!
FOUND 'EM.

18:46.805 --> 18:48.426
AND, NO, MY DAD
DOESN'T MEAN, LIKE,

18:48.526 --> 18:50.429
UNCHARACTERISTIC
IN A GOOD WAY.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.871

ACTING CRAZY, LIKE,

18:52.971 --> 18:54.593
SUPER DEPRESSED

18:54.693 --> 18:58.197

THINGS THAT AREN'T THERE.

WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

19:09.869 --> 19:11.250

ASK YOU SOMETHING?

19:11.350 --> 19:13.172

YOU PUT

19:21.400 --> 19:23.403
A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON
JUST KEEPING IT FUN.

19:24.724 --> 19:26.586
WHAT CHANGED?

19:26.686 --> 19:28.948
I CHANGED.

19:29.048 --> 19:31.050
BECAUSE OF YOU.

19:32.011 --> 19:34.654
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORTH ME
CONFRONTING MY FEAR.

IS THE FETTUCCINE
THAT BAD?

RIGHT TO DESSERT?

19:54.555 --> 19:56.137

A MOVIE

19:56.237 --> 19:58.239
ON MY TABLET TOGETHER
BEFORE IT DIES.

UH, WHAT WERE YOU LIKE
AS A KID?

20:10.211 --> 20:11.913

STRIKE ME

20:12.013 --> 20:14.155
AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS
A LOT OF FEARS.

I'M GOOD AT THAT.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.080
PRETENDING I'M OK
WHEN I'M NOT.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.403
I HAD TO GET
GOOD AT IT.

20:21.503 --> 20:23.885
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

20:23.985 --> 20:27.048
I FELL HARD FOR
THE PERFECT GUY.

20:27.148 --> 20:29.731
HE WAS CHARMING AND SWEET,

20:29.831 --> 20:33.415
AND IT TURNS OUT
HE WAS ENGAGED.

20:33.515 --> 20:37.059
BY THE END OF IT,
ALL THREE OF US GOT HURT.

20:37.159 --> 20:39.782
AND THE FACT
THAT I PLAYED A ROLE

20:39.882 --> 20:41.664
IN DESTROYING
A SISTER'S RELATIONSHIP,

20:41.764 --> 20:44.446
THAT LEFT A PRETTY BIG
EMOTIONAL SCAR.

20:46.529 --> 20:50.753
SPENCER, YOU'RE
THE FIRST PERSON

20:50.853 --> 20:52.515

WANT TO DROP

20:52.615 --> 20:54.677
ALL THOSE WALLS
AGAIN.

20:54.777 --> 20:56.679
BUT I SAW THE WAY
YOU LOOKED AT OLIVIA

20:56.779 --> 20:58.601
THAT NIGHT
AT THE ROAST.

20:58.701 --> 21:01.164
IT BROUGHT BACK
A LOT OF OLD FEELINGS.

21:01.264 --> 21:04.127
I CAN'T BE THE OTHER
WOMAN AGAIN, SPENCER.

21:04.227 --> 21:06.229
YOU'RE NOT THE OTHER WOMAN.

21:07.310 --> 21:09.312
SO, YOU'RE NOT STILL
IN LOVE WITH OLIVIA?

21:12.395 --> 21:15.919
IS THERE STILL
A CONNECTION THERE? YEAH.

21:17.521 --> 21:20.464
BUT OLIVIA AND I ARE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

21:20.564 --> 21:24.067
ALL THE REASONS WE
BROKE UP ARE STILL THERE.

21:24.167 --> 21:27.351
OK. THAT'S HONEST.

22:13.218 --> 22:14.159
ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT?

22:14.259 --> 22:16.041
I DON'T KNOW. A TIMELINE?

DECIDED TO GO TO TOWN.

THE OTHER SIDE OF IT,

THAT MAYBE MY FEARS
