00:10.635 --> 00:11.761
[dials rapidly]

00:11.845 --> 00:13.346
[line ringing]

00:14.097 --> 00:15.140
Whew.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.518
-BoJack?
-I'm back in L.A.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.229
-I should have called you--
-Yeah. You should have.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.356
-I said I was sorry.
-No, you didn't.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.985
-Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.
-No--

00:27.068 --> 00:28.820
[sighs] Ugh.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.240
[sighs]

00:35.285 --> 00:36.286
What the...?

00:37.370 --> 00:38.747
Okay, thank you.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.415
What's going on here?

00:40.498 --> 00:43.918
Fundraising dinner for the Peanutbutter
for California campaign.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.005
-All right, I'm just gonna--
-Sorry. It's a fundraiser.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.757
-Uh...
-BoJack!

00:48.840 --> 00:50.759
I love your ironic take
on black-tie attire.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.012
It really says,
"I truly don't care what you think of me."

00:54.095 --> 00:56.514
This light bulb won't let me in
to your house without paying.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.726
Ah, sorry about that.
Gotta raise those funds.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.770
-Can't I just--
-Thanks for your support, buddy.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.521
-Means so much. Erica!
-Hey--

01:03.605 --> 01:05.899
Look at you,
with the right number of ears!

01:05.982 --> 01:08.193
-Look, I just--
-Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.736
[growls]

01:11.279 --> 01:13.114
-Hmm...!
-[pops]

01:13.198 --> 01:14.199
Oh.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.494
Hey, do you have another bathroom?
They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.079
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.998
Because if I were pregnant, it would be
bad luck to tell you this early.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.875
Presuming it was early.
But I'm not pregnant.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.586
This is just a normal,
non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.047
-There's a bathroom in the pool house.
-You're a lifesaver.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.465
Pardon me! Out of my way.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.217
Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.677
Because you are looking
"gorges" this evening.

01:34.761 --> 01:39.307
Well, I must be in Nazi Germany,
because you're "not so" bad yourself.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.601
-I'm sorry, yours was better.
-[BoJack] Hi.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.061
Whoa.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.437
[munches]

01:44.521 --> 01:45.480
Well, I should go.

01:45.563 --> 01:49.275
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife
is talking to my other ex-wife.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.320
-You have two ex-wives here?
-Katrina's his campaign manager.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.115
[Peanutbutter] And Jessica Biel loves
getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.

01:55.198 --> 02:00.203
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,
in the same room! This is great.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.913
-Hey.
-BoJack, I'm busy.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.331
You haven't seen me for a year and a half.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.875
Yeah, because you disapp--
No, I am not doing this now.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.211
-Why don't you get yourself a drink?
-I will get a drink.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.214
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.
[crunches]

02:12.632 --> 02:13.466
[sighs]

02:13.550 --> 02:15.301
Oh, Norman, we have to support the--

02:15.385 --> 02:16.845
-Ooh, yes.
-All right.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.804
[grunts]

02:17.887 --> 02:19.514
Hi, Zach Braff. Zach Braff.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.808
Hey there. Famous actor Zach Braff,
how you doing?

02:21.891 --> 02:24.435
-[glass clinks]
-Everyone? Thank you all for being here.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.939
We're gonna beat that scoundrel
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz...

02:28.022 --> 02:29.232
Boo!

02:29.315 --> 02:32.569
...and bring likability back to politics.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.486
[cheering]

02:33.570 --> 02:37.240
I especially want to thank my pro-fracking
pals for being here tonight.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.119
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"
but we did it anyway,

02:41.202 --> 02:43.371
and it all worked out.
Love you, sweetie.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.289
Mm-hmm.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.416
Finally-- oh!
Sorry about that, folks.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.418
I sensed an earthquake.
Must have been a false--

02:48.501 --> 02:49.961
Oh, hey now!

02:50.044 --> 02:51.796
Nope, I was definitely wrong.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.382
Listen to me,
I'm the dog who cried earthquake.

02:54.465 --> 02:55.300
[laughing]

02:55.383 --> 02:57.051
-[bangs]
-[voices overlapping]

02:57.635 --> 02:59.971
-We're gonna die!
-Oh, fudge!

03:00.054 --> 03:02.181
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-I can't die!

03:02.265 --> 03:06.102
I'm not famous enough yet to make
the "In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars!

03:06.185 --> 03:07.562
I have so many regrets!

03:07.645 --> 03:10.481
I just picked up a family sitcom
where the mom is a zombie!

03:10.565 --> 03:14.903
[moans]
It's called<i> Mombie, </i>and it's terrible!

03:14.986 --> 03:18.114
I have a condition where every time
I sense a shift in power dynamics,

03:18.197 --> 03:19.657
I have a tiny orgasm!

03:19.741 --> 03:22.327
I have no original ideas,
I just repeat things I hear.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.662
-I've never been in love!
-I've never been in love!

03:24.746 --> 03:26.539
I tried gay at theater camp!

03:26.623 --> 03:29.834
I regret <i>everything!</i>

03:31.920 --> 03:33.755
-[Peanutbutter] Whoa!
-[BoJack laughs]

03:33.838 --> 03:34.756
-[crashes]
-[all gasp]

03:39.719 --> 03:42.555
[theme music playing]

04:36.651 --> 04:38.111
[voices overlapping]

04:38.194 --> 04:39.195
Hello?

04:42.031 --> 04:44.575
Is anyone getting any bars?
I'm not getting any baa-rs.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.413
Can someone validate my valet ticket?
I would like to go home now.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.001
There's no way out.
Okay. Everybody stay sane.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.253
I propose we set each other on fire
for warmth.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.880
Who wants to be set on fire first?
Not me, I'm Jessica Biel.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.257
[woman] Yeah, that's right.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.633
The natives are getting restless,

05:00.717 --> 05:03.386
so why don't you say something
to comfort them?

05:03.469 --> 05:05.722
Okay. Everyone, remain calm!

05:05.805 --> 05:08.599
No one's going to light anyone on fire.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.393
For one thing,
that'd eat up a lot of oxygen

05:10.476 --> 05:12.145
and who knows
how much we have down here.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.897
-[man] I want oxygen!
-[man screams] Air! I need air!

05:14.981 --> 05:16.858
[guests screaming]

05:16.941 --> 05:18.067
God.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.153
-You okay, sweetie?
-I think so.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.155
-That was really scary.
-Yeah.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.157
At least we know no one
is specifically at fault.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.783
Well, except for San Andreas.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.953
This was because you fracked
under our house.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.040
I told you fracking was dangerous,
and you didn't listen.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.752
And now our house is ruined
and we're trapped underground,

05:35.835 --> 05:37.628
and we're all going to die!

05:38.921 --> 05:42.216
-Is this one of our sexy fights?
-[yells] No!

05:43.176 --> 05:44.093
Hmm.

05:45.803 --> 05:46.929
[sighs]

05:47.013 --> 05:48.473
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.517
You can be mad at me or get drunk
with me, but you can't do both.

05:52.101 --> 05:52.935
Watch me.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.940
Oh, what the shit?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.693
[creaks, crashes]

06:00.943 --> 06:04.530
-Oh, fish.
-[Todd] Uh... hello?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.284
-What are you doing in there?
-Uh, I live here.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.453
Didn't you know
there was a huge party going on?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.830
I was going to go to the party
after my bath,

06:12.914 --> 06:16.292
but then I realized
the bath <i>was </i>the party.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.211
Oh, God.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.963
Well, I'm not waiting around
to be rescued like some chump.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.298
Come on, let's go.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.219
[Todd] Whoa...!

06:28.805 --> 06:32.016
-We gotta go in there?
-Well, I don't see any other way.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.977
Sometimes life is like the second season
of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>--

06:35.061 --> 06:37.855
you gotta push through
and hope there's better stuff ahead.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.107
Aw-ww!

06:41.692 --> 06:46.197
Guys, let's all try to just stay cool
and make the best of things, huh?

06:46.280 --> 06:49.784
"Make the best of things"? You idiot,
we're trapped and we're terrified.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.620
Okay, settle down,
you future hard <i>Jeopardy</i> question.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.622
Let's hear what the idiot has to say.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.833
So that's a re-up on the idiot part?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.168
How are we supposed to make
the best of things?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.546
-We're stuck underground.
-This is true.

07:01.629 --> 07:06.134
But most of us are important celebrities,
so someone will come for us soon.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.970
And for you regulars,
I'm sure they'll bring you up with us!

07:09.053 --> 07:10.346
What do we do till then?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.766
We're actors! I say we put on a show.
Who's with me?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.394
A show? Who will be the star?
Me, I assume.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.855
Sure you'll be the star,
and you'll be the star!

07:18.938 --> 07:21.983
And you'll be the star!
We'll all be the star!

07:22.066 --> 07:25.778
Folks, I promise you
we will be out of here in no time.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.821
[cheering]

07:28.531 --> 07:30.533
And that's when I realized...

07:30.616 --> 07:33.619
I just don't have the face for bangs.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.664
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
You're too kind! Thank you.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.960
Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing
<i>Tale from the Above Ground. </i>Who's next?

07:41.043 --> 07:42.962
I can't take this anymore.
I need to get out.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.089
This is the longest I've gone
without moisturizing,

07:45.173 --> 07:46.799
-and I feel like a lizard!
-Humph.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.926
-No offense.
-It's only been 72 hours.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.305
I'm missing my general meeting at CBS.
I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.682
I can't live like this!
We've gotta light someone on fire.

07:54.765 --> 07:58.394
I'm starting to think that less-famous
Michelle Monaghan has the right idea

07:58.478 --> 08:00.313
-about lighting people on fire.
-Thank you.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.691
Come on, party people, keep it together.
Let's not forget why we're here--

08:03.774 --> 08:05.526
to raise money for my campaign,

08:05.610 --> 08:08.988
and more recently, to not go crazy
and murder each other.

08:09.071 --> 08:13.951
Can someone please bring me my car?
It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.786
You're killing me, Zach.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.164
[sighs]
Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.249
Be the leader that I know you can be.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.793
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.212
-[bangs]
-What in the world?

08:25.963 --> 08:27.757
<i>"Vox clamantis in deserto."</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:30.259
-It is I.
-Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz!

08:30.343 --> 08:31.469
-We're saved!
-Wow!

08:31.552 --> 08:32.678
Oh, thank God. A leader.

08:32.762 --> 08:33.930
-[Diane laughs]
-[BoJack] Sh.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.682
What's going on down here?
Anyone's looking for us?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.768
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.146
Diane, have you just been getting drunk
with BoJack this whole time?

08:42.230 --> 08:45.149
-What? I'm still mad at you.
-[BoJack laughing]

08:45.233 --> 08:47.985
-Citizens, remain calm.
-Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

08:48.069 --> 08:50.571
Rescue workers are coming
but it could be a while.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.533
State emergency funds have been depleted
due to budget overruns

08:53.616 --> 08:56.827
on a costly bridge to Hawaii
that's being constructed.

08:56.911 --> 08:57.745
Oh, yeah!

08:57.828 --> 09:00.831
Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,
I came to get you out early.

09:00.915 --> 09:05.169
Is that what a woodchuck is?
Why did I think it was like a beaver?

09:05.253 --> 09:07.755
What's it like out there, Woodchuck?
Whole neighborhood totaled?

09:07.838 --> 09:10.591
-Is the city in chaos?
-No, it's really just your house.

09:10.675 --> 09:14.262
Because of all the fracking that's been
happening underneath your house.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.722
Oh! Interesting!

09:16.806 --> 09:18.266
-Ay-yi-yi.
-Oh, right, right.

09:18.349 --> 09:23.229
So you just burrowed down here to rescue
your political opponent's top donors.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.355
That's convenient.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.440
It was actually very inconvenient,

09:26.524 --> 09:30.528
but I put politics aside
to save you people from dying.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.405
Three cheers for Woodchuck!

09:32.488 --> 09:33.573
[all]
Hip, hip, hooray!

09:33.656 --> 09:36.325
Please, don't cheer too loudly.
The tunnel is very delicate.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.578
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Seriously, I think it's best to--

09:38.661 --> 09:40.288
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-[rumbling]

09:42.665 --> 09:43.624
[sighs]

09:43.708 --> 09:46.669
-Let's cheer one more time, just for fun!
-No, please.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.630
-Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...
-Hooray!

09:49.714 --> 09:51.132
-No!
-[rumbling]

09:52.717 --> 09:54.635
[screams]

09:54.719 --> 09:59.599
So turns out three cheers was probably
an adequate number of cheers.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.272
[rumbling]

10:06.355 --> 10:08.149
-What was that?
-Just keep walking.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.567
God, I can't wait to get home.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.235
I don't even have a home anymore.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.615
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all
my different colored hats I never wear?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.576
Well, if you need another couch
to crash on, there's always my place.

10:18.659 --> 10:22.455
-Didn't you move in with Ralph?
-Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.166
-Just in case, I guess.
-In case of what?

10:25.249 --> 10:26.667
-[faint chattering]
-What was that?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.377
Whoa!

10:28.461 --> 10:30.129
Oh!

10:32.089 --> 10:32.965
[yelps]

10:33.049 --> 10:35.968
Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.137
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

10:38.220 --> 10:39.138
[ants gasp]

10:39.221 --> 10:40.931
[chattering]

10:41.265 --> 10:44.393
Did you say you're a princess?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.229
-That's just my name. I'm a manager.
-It's like an agent.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.440
-It's totally different.
-Is it, though?

10:49.523 --> 10:53.444
-Silence! You negotiate deals?
-Mm-hmm.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.698
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.991
[ant leader laughs]

11:02.161 --> 11:04.538
My hands... they're crushed.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.582
There's no way I can dig us back out now.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.750
Well, I can dig!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.877
Actually, no one should dig.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.129
Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.591
The slightest provocation could cause
another collapse that would crush us all.

11:15.674 --> 11:16.509
[all gasp]

11:16.592 --> 11:20.304
I know that because I bought a sitcom
about fracking, <i>The Frack Shack.</i>

11:20.388 --> 11:23.057
It's <i>New Girl</i> meets fracking.
[chuckles]

11:23.140 --> 11:25.351
Oh, God, no one's gonna watch
that show, huh?

11:25.434 --> 11:26.602
[groans]

11:26.685 --> 11:30.314
Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.733
Parcel out food and water
and see how much we've got.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.404
-I'll assign team leaders.
-Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.197
[groans]

11:40.241 --> 11:41.742
[guests chuckling]

11:42.326 --> 11:43.661
All right. Um...

11:44.328 --> 11:46.372
-God...!
-For you, a banana

11:46.455 --> 11:49.083
-because you're so appealing.
-Yeah.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.085
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.878
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.340
I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.467
-And who made you the food captain?
-Woodchuck.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.636
Exactly. He's in charge.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.556
Excuse me,
you have not been allocated those rations.

12:03.639 --> 12:07.226
I'm a horse. I need more food,
and I'm a celebrity.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.979
-Everyone down here is a celebrity.
-Not the caterers.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.564
Relinquish the food.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.065
Hey. Here's your chance.

12:13.149 --> 12:18.904
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house
and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.032
This man has already reached
his allotted food portion for the day.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.868
Who said we have to go by your rules?

12:23.951 --> 12:26.328
Yeah, who made you leader
of underground?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.038
I'm just gonna take all this and...

12:28.122 --> 12:30.541
You've appointed me.
Yes, I under-- citizens, look...

12:30.624 --> 12:32.918
Keep it together.
[grunts]

12:33.752 --> 12:36.338
-Weird stuff going on downstairs.
-[clicking]

12:36.422 --> 12:37.590
Humph.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.551
-I can't believe this is my life.
-Uh-oh.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.137
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze?

12:43.220 --> 12:46.223
I'm trapped underground
and it's all my husband's fault

12:46.307 --> 12:51.270
and I'm gonna die in this mansion
in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.814
Okay. But on the bright side--

12:53.898 --> 12:58.194
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,
you got a cool job, you got friends.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.778
Jesus, you're right.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.073
Even when I was above ground,
I wasn't satisfied.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.243
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

13:07.828 --> 13:09.455
[sobbing]

13:09.538 --> 13:11.207
Whoa!

13:11.290 --> 13:12.124
What the...?

13:12.208 --> 13:16.545
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

13:16.629 --> 13:17.922
No. It...

13:18.005 --> 13:20.674
I am! I'm a pit.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.553
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

13:24.637 --> 13:25.971
Diane, you're not a pit.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.099
I'm a pit!
[sobbing]

13:30.518 --> 13:31.685
[sighs]

13:33.812 --> 13:37.024
I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.860
It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.571
You disappeared for a year and a half.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.491
So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.827
If you were back in L.A.,
why didn't you call me?

13:48.911 --> 13:52.414
-I wasn't... ready.
-Ready? For what?

13:52.498 --> 13:55.042
I wanted to be better
when you saw me again.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.128
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.173
And even if I did get better,
the best I could ever be

14:01.257 --> 14:04.760
is still just some other version of me.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.681
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.766
I need you in my life.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.477
-Really?
-You're the biggest asshole I know,

14:13.561 --> 14:16.105
and you're the only thing
that makes sense to me.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.440
[Diane sighs, moans]

14:20.651 --> 14:23.946
People should be able to have
some control over their lives down here.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.906
-Yeah!
-People need boundaries.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.242
Leadership means
sometimes being the bad guy.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.995
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!

14:31.078 --> 14:32.788
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.915
-That's not...
-That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.501
And I'm the good guy,
so that's two points for me.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.086
What points? There are no points.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.922
-This is not a game!
-Well, maybe there should be points.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.215
-Yeah!
-Points!

14:43.299 --> 14:46.844
People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.763
Well, I'm the one who came down here
to save you in the first place.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.348
Surely I get points for that.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.602
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.603
-He's right!
-What?!

14:55.686 --> 14:57.813
If you came down to save us,
why are we still here?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.856
[all] Yeah!

14:58.939 --> 15:00.566
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

15:00.649 --> 15:01.567
-Yeah!
-That's right.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.860
Minus point for Woodchuck.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.071
I implore you not to fall
into a mob mentality.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.824
-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!
-Yeah!

15:08.908 --> 15:12.536
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy
is as broken as his hands.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.289
That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.626
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.

15:18.709 --> 15:22.671
An outsider like me,
the guy whose house this is.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.257
[chanting]
Peanutbutter, Peanutbutter.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.675
Peanutbutter-- everybody.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.136
[chanting]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

15:29.219 --> 15:30.220
Peanutbutter!

15:30.304 --> 15:31.388
-Me!
-Peanutbutter!

15:31.472 --> 15:32.806
-Me!
-Peanutbutter!

15:32.890 --> 15:34.850
[faint chanting]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter...

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
-[snoring]
-BoJack. BoJack.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.103
-BoJack.
-What?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.397
-Did you know I can juggle?
-Cool.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.692
Are you okay?
I mean, outside of our current situation

15:43.776 --> 15:45.861
of being buried alive
and almost out of alcohol

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
except for cooking sherry and Midori?

15:48.030 --> 15:51.533
It's just been a rough couple years
with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.202
-And Corduroy?
-Cordu-what now?

15:53.285 --> 15:58.332
Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson?
Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

15:58.415 --> 16:00.918
Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...

16:01.669 --> 16:05.005
girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.257
You got daughter? Ruh-roh.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.635
-[clatters]
-Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."

16:09.718 --> 16:11.637
Supposed to help her figure out
who her mother is.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.972
But I don't know where to start.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.433
Did she try sending mutual consent form
to the adoption agency?

16:16.517 --> 16:17.643
What, what words?

16:17.726 --> 16:21.355
Well, if it's closed adoption,
you send a mutual consent form.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.816
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

16:23.899 --> 16:28.445
If Mom says same thing,
boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
-How do you know about that?
-I had an adopted brother.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.367
And also for a while,
I hoped I was adopted.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.369
-Ugh!
-Huh.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.622
-Whoa!
-Ooh!

16:39.498 --> 16:42.960
Who dares disturb Queen Antonia?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.378
My name is Princess Carolyn.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.464
I represent the soldiers
of Subcolony K-147,

16:47.548 --> 16:50.801
who feel they're doing all the work
while reaping none of the spoils.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.596
Everything my soldiers do
benefits the colony.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.182
I had this same conversation
with Jeffrey Katzenberg.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.268
Believe me, this doesn't end well
for you.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.103
[sighs]
What are your demands?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.688
[whispers]

17:02.771 --> 17:05.190
They want to have sex with your drones.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.109
<i>My </i>drones?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.028
[dance music plays]

17:09.111 --> 17:10.112
Mm-hmm.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.448
Oliver, assemble the small council.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.160
Uh, If we're gonna be down here a while,
can I get a new towel?

17:16.910 --> 17:18.704
[guests chanting]

17:19.413 --> 17:21.457
Woodchuck's aa-always telling us
what to do!

17:21.540 --> 17:24.585
He says help is coming,
but how does he know? What if he's lying?

17:24.668 --> 17:27.546
[wails]
And I have still not been validated!

17:27.629 --> 17:29.131
If you could all be patient...

17:29.214 --> 17:31.633
We're sick of waiting!
It's time for new leadership.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.343
That attempted movie star is right!

17:33.427 --> 17:37.473
I declare Mr. Peanutbutter
President-for-life of Underground.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.390
[guests] Yeah!

17:38.474 --> 17:39.933
[grunting]
Uh, uh, oh!

17:40.017 --> 17:41.393
-Thank you!
-What? No!

17:41.477 --> 17:44.104
-What do we do with Woodchuck?
-He must be made an example of.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.272
-[man] Get him!
-Yeah!

17:45.355 --> 17:47.357
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.652
We don't need to "get him."
Let's just tie him up someplace

17:50.736 --> 17:53.072
where he can't hurt us anymore
with his dangerous ideas.

17:53.155 --> 17:57.367
Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.
No, don't-- no...!

17:57.451 --> 17:58.702
-[chanting] Peanutbutter!
-No!

17:58.786 --> 18:01.330
-Peanutbutter!
-Thank you, thank you all.

18:01.413 --> 18:05.375
As my first act as President-for-life,
I declare that everyone

18:05.459 --> 18:08.295
is allowed to eat and drink
whatever they want!

18:08.378 --> 18:09.755
[all] Yeah!

18:09.838 --> 18:11.090
[crashing]

18:12.925 --> 18:15.010
-[groans]
-[whimpers]

18:15.094 --> 18:16.386
Agh--!

18:16.887 --> 18:17.888
I'm starving,

18:17.971 --> 18:20.516
and not the normal celebrity
kind of starving like I always am.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.017
Or even red-carpet-season starving.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.436
-Where's the food?
-[Woodchuck] You ate all the food.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.730
This is it!

18:26.814 --> 18:29.900
Nobody's coming for us.
We need to kill someone for food.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.944
-Hmm...!
-Oh...!

18:32.027 --> 18:33.403
Let's eat Mr. Peanutbutter!

18:33.487 --> 18:35.739
He has the word "peanut butter"
in his name!

18:35.823 --> 18:36.782
[all] Yeah!

18:36.865 --> 18:40.244
Guys, guys, guys,
maybe we don't need to eat anybody!

18:40.327 --> 18:41.829
-[all groan]
-What's this now?

18:41.912 --> 18:43.914
Let's listen to the guy
who's saying don't kill me.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.499
He's got some interesting ideas.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.126
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.379
I'm known for monologues
that sum things up at the end of the show.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.798
I drive a Prius,
which means I'm a good person.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.634
Let's not surrender
to our basest instincts.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.720
I know times are tough,
but I'm sure if we band together

18:58.804 --> 19:00.973
and really concentrate
on the problem at hand,

19:01.056 --> 19:03.225
we can, as a group of friends--
[screams]

19:05.102 --> 19:07.062
-Oh, my God.
-Biel!

19:07.146 --> 19:11.358
The rule of man is over.
Now begins the rule of fire.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.069
-[howls] Oh, why?
-Jessica, no.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.487
I will no longer be shackled

19:15.571 --> 19:18.115
by the civilized society
of the above ground.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.869
This is Underground,
and the only law here is flame.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.914
The fire wants not for justice.
The fire wants not for reason.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.668
-The fire desires only to be fed!
-Feed the fire!

19:29.751 --> 19:32.880
-The fire is my new god!
-[moans] Oh, God!

19:32.963 --> 19:35.716
I'm so sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter,
but the tide has turned

19:35.799 --> 19:37.676
and I side with the fire now.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.179
Tonight, we dine on Zach Braff.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.182
-Tomorrow, canine cuisine!
-No.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.225
You, take him to his spot,
and make him stay.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.810
-[squawks]
-No! No! Please!

19:46.894 --> 19:48.937
Listen to reason... this time!

19:49.688 --> 19:52.065
[gulps] Ah-hh!

19:52.149 --> 19:53.317
I think that's all of it.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.528
I can't go back to my old life sober.
It's so empty.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.947
Okay, okay.
Here's the secret to being happy.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.699
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

20:00.782 --> 20:04.620
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually
you'll forget you're pretending.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.746
Maybe you're right.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.790
I just need to stop complaining
and work harder.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.543
Everyone else is doing it.
Why am I so special?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.378
-[door bangs]
-Lock him in here!

20:13.462 --> 20:16.715
-Please! Diane, my sweet wife.
-What's going on?

20:16.798 --> 20:17.633
Marvin Gaye.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.219
The People of Underground
have a new god, the fire.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.138
And for my crimes
I will be fed to its ravenous flames.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.974
My only hope is the meat
of Zach Braff proves lasting,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.894
but I fear by daybreak,
there will be no Braff meat left.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.939
-What's going on?
-Four Non-Blondes.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.398
Everybody out except the prisoner.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.025
-[Diane] No!
-Easy on the merchandise!

20:35.108 --> 20:36.109
Get off me!

20:38.528 --> 20:41.031
Well, it's been a tough week,
lots of back and forth,

20:41.114 --> 20:44.201
but I think we've reached an agreement
that meets everybody's needs.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.495
"The queen will share
male sex servants with the soldiers

20:46.578 --> 20:48.622
for one night of magnificent,
sensuous splendor,

20:48.705 --> 20:50.499
a gorgeous bacchanal
of hedonistic delights,

20:50.582 --> 20:53.669
with a second orgy pickup option,
pursuant on success of the first."

20:53.752 --> 20:54.878
[hissing]

20:54.962 --> 20:56.964
My clients are satisfied with those terms.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.133
Great. Now can we please return
to the surface world?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.678
All my favorite clouds are up there.

21:02.761 --> 21:07.140
Oh, I like this one.
He's got moxie and a soft thorax.

21:07.224 --> 21:11.645
How did you find your fleshy self
in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?

21:11.728 --> 21:14.189
We were at this big
Beverly Hills fundraiser.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.609
There was an earthquake,
and now everyone's trapped underground.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.696
Did you say Beverly Hills?
Ugh! Of course.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.365
Surface dwellers are always moving in
on our territory.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.285
First they move here, then taxes go up,

21:26.368 --> 21:28.578
the next thing you know,
there's a Whole Foods.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.914
How am I supposed to concentrate
on a great orgy

21:30.998 --> 21:32.958
when I've got gentrification on my mind?

21:33.041 --> 21:35.877
No, we've got to get
those interlopers out of here.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.046
-Let's--
-Hey! Hold on.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.012
-Uh...
-[Jessica] Mr. Peanutbutter,

21:45.095 --> 21:48.473
did you or did you not tell us
we could eat whatever we wanted?

21:48.557 --> 21:49.683
[all] Peanutbutter!

21:49.766 --> 21:52.644
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

21:52.728 --> 21:53.979
We gotta do something.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.065
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty
thing that's ever happened to me

21:57.149 --> 21:58.900
and now they're gonna set him on fire.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.486
Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?
She's smart.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.405
I don't know. I need water.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.991
There is no more water.
That's the problem.

22:06.074 --> 22:06.908
"Choodwuck" is right.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.496
Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?
Like, a well?

22:11.580 --> 22:15.959
-Yeah! And we're underground.
-If we dig, we'll get water!

22:16.043 --> 22:20.172
-Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.
-Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

22:20.839 --> 22:24.051
Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.

22:24.134 --> 22:27.054
Any last words
before we light you on fire?

22:27.137 --> 22:31.058
Yes, if I could just say,
"Don't light me on fire"?

22:31.141 --> 22:35.771
The fire bends to no man's will.
Nothing can defeat the fire. Only--

22:35.854 --> 22:36.855
[Diane] Water!

22:37.689 --> 22:39.107
[Jessica] What? [gasps]

22:39.191 --> 22:42.569
-Oh, wow, it's really water.
-Water is stronger than fire.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.863
Wait, let's not really forget how-- ugh!

22:44.946 --> 22:46.406
Water is my new god now!

22:46.490 --> 22:48.366
Oh, boy.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.410
-Clear gold!
-All right, water!

22:50.494 --> 22:54.247
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!

22:54.331 --> 22:56.333
Hang on. It's-- it's not stopping.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.168
Which is great!

22:58.251 --> 23:00.253
You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.047
H-2-Oh, no!

23:04.007 --> 23:05.133
[guests whimpering]

23:06.218 --> 23:08.303
Well, I guess this is it.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.973
-[bangs]
-Oh, God! It's another earthquake!

23:12.057 --> 23:13.975
[all screaming]

23:15.519 --> 23:17.104
How is this happening?

23:17.938 --> 23:20.774
[ants] Heave! Heave! Heave!

23:20.857 --> 23:22.984
Get them out of here!

23:24.069 --> 23:25.445
Okay.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.281
No! Please! I'm important down here!

23:28.365 --> 23:30.408
[guests]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:31.910 --> 23:33.912
[crashes]

23:36.331 --> 23:40.502
Oh, what an eyesore.
The HOA will be hearing about this.

23:43.421 --> 23:47.843
We are never talking
about any of this ever again. Whew.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.762
So I will see you tomorrow.
We've got a rally in Bakersfield

23:50.846 --> 23:53.306
and then we're touring
a tennis ball factory in Modesto.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.558
Okay.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.227
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.229
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.356
-I don't tell you that enough.
-It's okay.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.734
If this governor thing
is really important to you...

24:04.818 --> 24:07.654
It's not. You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.323
I don't want to be governor.
I just wanted people to like me.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.200
Well, I like you.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.036
Come on, Diane, let's go home...

24:15.120 --> 24:16.496
oh, right.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.290
Well, thanks for inviting me
to your party.

24:18.373 --> 24:21.251
I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.169
Sure.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.258
-You guys hungry?
-I could eat.

24:28.341 --> 24:31.052
-Ethiopian?
-Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.972
I should go home.
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.348
He's probably worried about me.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.935
I'm down for Ethiopian.
I love that sponge bread.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.688
-What do they call it, "injera"?
-Yeah, injera.

24:41.771 --> 24:44.107
-Injera, right.
-That's right.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.651
Yeah, that's good bread.
