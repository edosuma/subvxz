WEBVTT

05:53.891 --> 05:55.088
- Hey.

08:04.989 --> 08:06.560
Here you go.

08:09.895 --> 08:11.092
Here ya go.

08:35.855 --> 08:39.956
Sometimes it feels
like things never change.

08:42.290 --> 08:43.729
But I promise you.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.635
They do. They have to.

08:51.772 --> 08:53.002
And I'm not saying it's easy.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.941
Change comes
with feelings of loss.

08:59.043 --> 09:00.240
And...

09:01.045 --> 09:02.583
We might feel resistance.

09:03.047 --> 09:07.115
Like there's so much in
the world that needs changing.

09:08.151 --> 09:09.381
Where am I supposed to start?

09:09.416 --> 09:10.822
Right?

09:11.253 --> 09:12.989
When you feel that way,

09:13.024 --> 09:15.827
that is the moment
to begin work.

09:17.226 --> 09:20.634
On whatever fires you up,
you just start chipping away.

09:22.836 --> 09:24.231
And if you look around
this room,

09:25.300 --> 09:26.970
you'll see
that you're not alone.

09:29.238 --> 09:32.745
Don't ever feel like
there's nothing you can do.

09:33.341 --> 09:34.747
Please.

09:37.081 --> 09:38.311
That's my wish for you.

09:39.688 --> 09:42.084
And now you've taken this class

09:42.119 --> 09:44.350
I know you won't be afraid
to use your words.

09:44.385 --> 09:46.022
-All right.

09:46.057 --> 09:48.893
That's all I've got.
You have 90 minutes.

09:49.324 --> 09:50.763
Make me proud.

09:56.397 --> 09:57.803
Well done.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.750
Uh, Professor Guidry,

10:10.785 --> 10:12.686
I just wanted to say
thank you for dealing

10:12.721 --> 10:14.688
with my crazy schedule.

10:14.723 --> 10:17.218
Gretchen,
that is so sweet of you,

10:17.253 --> 10:18.890
but you're the one
who made it work.

10:19.959 --> 10:21.860
I wish you had another
class I could take.

10:22.896 --> 10:24.324
I like teaching the basics.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.351
As the popular aphorism goes,

10:51.386 --> 10:53.221
"Those who can't do teach,"

10:53.256 --> 10:56.730
and those-- those who can't
teach become deans,

10:56.765 --> 10:58.226
'nother conversation.

10:59.801 --> 11:01.361
George has
played a critical role

11:01.396 --> 11:03.297
in building the culture
of this department

11:03.332 --> 11:06.135
over the years and we have
all benefited from his wisdom

11:06.170 --> 11:10.238
and we have had our spirits
lifted by his good humor.

11:10.273 --> 11:14.110
And man,
on a-- on a more personal note,

11:14.145 --> 11:16.112
I am just
humbled and grateful

11:16.147 --> 11:20.413
to call you a colleague,
a mentor and a fishing buddy.

11:20.448 --> 11:24.153
Seriously, folks,
this guy can cast a fly.

11:24.188 --> 11:26.892
I have seen him get a rise
out of a brown trout in one

11:26.927 --> 11:29.455
foot of stillwater,
I am not kidding you.

11:32.229 --> 11:33.800
Anyway, I've
embarrassed the man enough.

11:33.835 --> 11:35.362
To George.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.170
Thanks, man.

11:42.140 --> 11:43.810
It's gonna be hard
to fill your shoes, George.

11:43.845 --> 11:45.075
Tell ya that much.

11:45.110 --> 11:46.373
- Hey, Arthur.

11:46.408 --> 11:48.111
Sandra,
how ya holdin' up?

11:48.146 --> 11:49.343
You doin' okay?

11:50.082 --> 11:51.378
-- I'm good, I'm good.
-- Yeah.

11:52.414 --> 11:55.151
I didn't want to put you
on the spot in the meeting,

11:55.186 --> 11:57.758
but my sincere condolences.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.224
- I'm just glad that
she's not suffering anymore.

12:02.897 --> 12:05.392
Yeah. Yeah.
She's in a better place now.

12:07.902 --> 12:10.562
I-- I-- I did
have a quick question.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.202
- Yeah.
Okay, well, walk with me,

12:13.237 --> 12:14.841
'cause I got to get home.

12:14.876 --> 12:17.008
Hey, Gretchen,
can you find a tote bag

12:17.043 --> 12:18.240
for some of this stuff?

12:19.309 --> 12:21.177
- Did you see
a red truck this morning?

12:22.917 --> 12:25.016
- I see a red truck
every time I open my eyes,

12:25.051 --> 12:26.248
it's practically the state car.

12:27.152 --> 12:28.580
-Hey, Todd.
-Nice holiday.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.054
See ya, merry Christmas.

12:30.089 --> 12:32.056
- I mean, in the canyon.

12:33.356 --> 12:35.125
It was parked in my driveway.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.194
Probably hunters, right?

12:39.901 --> 12:41.098
- I don't know.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.200
Um...

12:45.203 --> 12:48.072
You know, Susan lost
her mom a few years back.

12:49.339 --> 12:52.307
It-- it brings up
all of the unresolved shit.

12:53.508 --> 12:57.477
Takes time.
Just go easy on yourself. Okay?

12:59.316 --> 13:01.085
Yeah, you're probably right.

13:05.289 --> 13:07.322
And I expect to see
you at the Christmas party!

13:08.523 --> 13:09.929
There's gonna be eggnog!

17:03.461 --> 17:04.658
Come on!

17:12.767 --> 17:14.173
C'mon, baby.

17:35.527 --> 17:37.856
-- Morning, ma'am.
-- Good morning to you.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.464
- It's a prime
spot you got here.

17:42.797 --> 17:45.501
Hey, we just figured
we'd walk up into the woods.

17:45.536 --> 17:47.833
We won't be any trouble for ya.
We'll stay out of your hair.

17:50.541 --> 17:52.211
You must have
got my note, though.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.576
I put it on
your truck yesterday.

17:58.186 --> 17:59.713
That's the first
I heard of any note.

17:59.748 --> 18:01.154
What-- What did it say?

18:03.488 --> 18:05.719
It said I'd prefer you
not park here.

18:09.824 --> 18:11.230
Uh-huh.

18:12.563 --> 18:14.497
It's just there's
not a lot of good jumping

18:14.532 --> 18:15.729
off points around here.

18:16.832 --> 18:18.798
- You could always
come in from the other side.

18:21.506 --> 18:22.703
The other side?

18:23.805 --> 18:25.211
How far is that?

18:25.906 --> 18:27.312
About 15 miles.

18:29.811 --> 18:31.283
Fifteen miles.

18:40.789 --> 18:42.426
Ma'am, we're not gonna
put a bullet

18:42.461 --> 18:43.856
in anyone's house
or shoot anybody's cow.

18:43.891 --> 18:45.726
I didn't think you were.

18:45.761 --> 18:47.596
Yeah, but you're telling me
you want us to walk

18:47.631 --> 18:48.861
15 miles in the snow.

18:48.896 --> 18:50.566
That's not what I said

18:50.601 --> 18:52.271
and I'm not
telling you to do anything.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.307
All I'm saying
is before you park

18:55.342 --> 18:59.111
on someone's property,
you have to ask.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.646
-- I heard about you.

19:06.683 --> 19:08.716
Just didn't
know it was this canyon.

19:14.295 --> 19:18.264
- All right.
Forget about her.

19:18.299 --> 19:19.496
Get in the truck.

19:33.611 --> 19:34.808
Too much.

19:48.956 --> 19:52.023
- Look,
obviously, nobody objects

19:52.058 --> 19:53.761
to the basic concept.

19:53.796 --> 19:56.731
I just think,
first and foremost,

19:56.766 --> 19:59.866
we need to look at cold,
hard qualifications.

19:59.901 --> 20:01.868
- So, like we said,
in the beginning,

20:01.903 --> 20:04.970
our job is to present the three
best candidates to the dean.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.708
Period.

20:06.743 --> 20:08.281
- Well,
I guess I'm just confused

20:08.316 --> 20:09.909
about what we mean by best.

20:09.944 --> 20:12.417
I don't think we should
be trying to fill

20:12.452 --> 20:14.320
some kind of quota.

20:14.355 --> 20:18.687
- Oh, course not.
No one is forcing our hand.

20:18.722 --> 20:22.053
These are just factors
we should consider

20:22.088 --> 20:24.462
among many others.

20:25.696 --> 20:28.763
Um, did anyone else
want to chime in?

20:35.904 --> 20:37.508
Yes.
Faith, you have a comment?

20:39.479 --> 20:42.348
To me, learning is about

20:43.648 --> 20:46.946
asking questions
and challenging yourself.

20:49.357 --> 20:51.423
Over the years,
some of my very best students

20:51.458 --> 20:54.822
have been Indians
from the reservation

20:54.857 --> 20:58.661
because they bring this whole
other experience into class.

21:00.698 --> 21:05.063
I think we could all
stand to listen more and learn

21:05.098 --> 21:09.309
more from people who don't have
the same perspective as us.

21:11.412 --> 21:15.315
You can call it diversity.
I don't know.

21:15.845 --> 21:19.352
It just seems like
the right thing to do

21:19.387 --> 21:23.818
to bring in different
sorts of people when we can,

21:24.689 --> 21:28.053
rather than doing the same
old thing we've been doing.

21:33.995 --> 21:36.435
I think your point's
very well taken, Faith.

21:38.439 --> 21:39.636
Let's make it a priority.

21:42.003 --> 21:44.971
Um... all right.

30:07.574 --> 30:09.948
- Ma'am, would you mind
spelling your last name for me?

30:11.050 --> 30:13.611
G-U-I-D-R-Y.

30:18.321 --> 30:22.026
Cassandra Guidry.
That's a name.

30:23.491 --> 30:25.260
Where you from originally?

30:27.198 --> 30:28.395
New Orleans.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.068
New Orleans.

30:32.599 --> 30:34.170
What do they call that, uh...

30:36.075 --> 30:37.635
-Uh--
-The Big Easy.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.011
The Big Easy. That's right.
I was getting there.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.479
There's a lot of history
down there, you know?

30:49.418 --> 30:51.187
You work in town?

30:51.222 --> 30:52.892
I teach at the university.

30:53.455 --> 30:54.652
Is that right?

30:55.963 --> 30:57.160
What subject you teach?

30:57.723 --> 31:01.967
I'm sorry.
Is this relevant?

31:06.534 --> 31:09.205
Yeah. Sorry.

31:11.044 --> 31:16.509
Um, you said your first direct
contact-- your only direct

31:16.544 --> 31:18.412
contact with them
was in the driveway

31:18.447 --> 31:19.710
when they're trying to park?

31:19.745 --> 31:21.954
Two days ago.
That's correct.

31:21.989 --> 31:28.620
Okay. And, uh, did they
threaten you at all that time?

31:28.655 --> 31:32.261
Not overtly,
but I have definitely

31:32.296 --> 31:33.658
been made to feel threatened.

31:37.004 --> 31:38.300
Okay. Um...

31:39.534 --> 31:40.940
Ms. Guidry.

31:43.109 --> 31:46.308
City environment, you catch
somebody on your property,

31:46.343 --> 31:49.443
that's a bad thing, so you
contact law enforcement, right?

31:50.347 --> 31:52.248
Out here,
things are a little different.

31:52.283 --> 31:56.186
And people,
generally, they tend to handle

31:56.221 --> 31:58.617
this sort of thing
amongst themselves.

32:00.291 --> 32:02.027
You know,
you let the small things

32:02.062 --> 32:04.326
go to avoid a bigger
problem down the road--

32:04.361 --> 32:08.033
Officer, they shot
an arrow into my door.

32:08.068 --> 32:12.037
I understand that,
but you did tow their truck.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.174
Perhaps I should not
have done that,

32:17.209 --> 32:19.077
but I was well
within my rights.

32:19.112 --> 32:21.211
Oh, of course you were.
Of course.

32:21.246 --> 32:25.446
But you can see how that sort
of thing, you know,

32:25.481 --> 32:26.678
might upset a person.

32:27.814 --> 32:30.451
And I've got to warn you,
that these two gentlemen,

32:30.486 --> 32:33.190
they are likely to see
you're involving the local

32:33.225 --> 32:36.028
sheriff's department
as yet another escalation.

32:39.264 --> 32:41.198
Why do you keep
calling them gentlemen?

32:51.507 --> 32:55.146
Did you happen
to catch their license plate?

32:57.150 --> 33:00.019
2-3-8-3-9-5.

33:08.359 --> 33:12.097
And why did you collect
all of this, exactly?

33:12.132 --> 33:14.759
I mean, most folks,
they wouldn't think to keep

33:14.794 --> 33:16.200
all of this stuff.

33:17.434 --> 33:19.269
I guess I'm not most folks.

33:22.274 --> 33:24.769
Yeah. So...

33:27.411 --> 33:29.147
Well,
thank you for your time.

33:31.118 --> 33:32.381
So, what happens now?

33:35.617 --> 33:37.815
Well, I've got a pretty good
idea who these boys are,

33:37.850 --> 33:39.850
so I work with them,

33:39.885 --> 33:41.456
see if I can't
straighten this out.

33:41.491 --> 33:43.689
Great.
I'll get my coat.

33:44.659 --> 33:47.363
Ma'am, there's really no
need for you to come along.

34:12.753 --> 34:14.159
Hello.

34:15.558 --> 34:16.821
How's it going in here, today?

34:16.856 --> 34:18.559
What is she doing here, Gus?

34:19.661 --> 34:21.694
-Lady, what is your problem--
-Hey, hey, hey

34:21.729 --> 34:24.598
Let's just relax here, okay?

34:24.633 --> 34:26.534
There's no need
for you to talk to her.

34:26.569 --> 34:29.141
You just talk to me.
Keep it civil.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.243
We're gonna
do this right now, Gus?

34:33.345 --> 34:35.246
This is honest
work I'm doing here.

34:35.281 --> 34:36.874
You're gonna get me fired.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.876
- I'm not gonna
get you fired. I promise. Okay?

34:38.911 --> 34:42.682
It seems you boys put an arrow
in her door last night.

34:42.717 --> 34:44.123
Is that right?

34:46.193 --> 34:47.687
- No, I don't know
anything about that.

34:48.525 --> 34:50.888
Did she tell you that she damn
near broke my fucking axle?

34:50.923 --> 34:52.824
- Hey,
let's just relax. Okay?

34:52.859 --> 34:54.529
She's pretty
up front with you.

34:55.367 --> 34:57.235
She doesn't
want you on her property.

34:57.270 --> 34:58.797
You got to respect that,
all right?

34:58.832 --> 35:00.403
That's pretty funny.

35:00.438 --> 35:02.141
You talking
about respect, Sheriff.

35:05.674 --> 35:07.443
I'm not the sheriff
and you know that.

35:08.677 --> 35:10.380
I'm the acting sheriff.

35:14.881 --> 35:16.584
All right, shit, man.

35:16.619 --> 35:18.553
-Can we wrap this up?
-Yeah, we can wrap it up.

35:20.491 --> 35:22.392
You stay
off her goddamn property.

35:22.427 --> 35:24.229
You find someplace
else to hunt.

35:25.265 --> 35:26.462
Is that clear?

35:31.601 --> 35:33.667
No, you gotta say it.

35:36.441 --> 35:39.244
-Yep.
-Yeah, what?

35:41.776 --> 35:43.446
-Yeah, we're clear.
-Great.

35:46.385 --> 35:47.582

36:22.784 --> 36:25.323
but I'm not here
to chit chat, okay?

36:34.961 --> 36:36.060
Should we call for backup?

36:37.469 --> 36:39.667
What backup? We've got two
officers to cover 300 square

36:39.702 --> 36:41.867
miles and one
of them's currently

36:41.902 --> 36:45.277
on administrative leave.
So that leaves me.

36:46.478 --> 36:47.675

36:51.714 --> 36:53.714

37:38.123 --> 37:39.529
Behind you.

37:46.703 --> 37:48.032
Afternoon, gentlemen.

37:50.872 --> 37:53.345
Now, I'm not
here to arrest anybody.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.043

I know you can hear me.

38:11.024 --> 38:15.631
Okay. Everybody step forward!

You put your saws down,
you take your masks off!

38:18.636 --> 38:21.065
Or what? You're gonna
shoot us, Wolf?

38:22.673 --> 38:24.376
Nobody's shooting anybody.

38:24.411 --> 38:27.038
Yeah. Why don't you tell
that to my cousin.

38:29.108 --> 38:30.745
I didn't shoot your cousin--

38:30.780 --> 38:32.681
Your piece of shit boss did.

38:32.716 --> 38:35.750
Now he's collecting hazard
pay with his feet kicked up.

38:35.785 --> 38:37.719
My cousin got a hole
in his back--

38:37.754 --> 38:39.050
- All right,
I'm done talking!

38:40.427 --> 38:42.658
Take your masks off right now!

38:42.693 --> 38:44.627
Why the fuck would we do that?

38:44.662 --> 38:46.464
Because I told you to,
that's why--

38:46.499 --> 38:47.861
-- Fuck you, Wolf.
-Fuck you.

38:47.896 --> 38:49.863
Everybody better calm down!

38:49.898 --> 38:51.700
Yo, why you open your holster?

38:51.735 --> 38:53.064
I'm not gonna ask you again.

38:53.099 --> 38:55.000
Why did you open
your fucking holster?

38:55.035 --> 38:57.871
Dougie, goddamn it,
I know you. I know your family.

38:57.906 --> 38:59.807
-I don't wanna hurt--
-You wanna kill us too, pig?

38:59.842 --> 39:01.776
-Fuck you--
-Back the fuck up and put--

39:01.811 --> 39:03.008
Hey, hey!

39:07.916 --> 39:09.388
Who the fuck are you?

39:12.525 --> 39:13.920
You're angry about your cousin.

39:15.627 --> 39:16.857
I'd be angry, too.

39:17.761 --> 39:20.025
And whoever did it should
be brought to justice.

39:20.060 --> 39:22.093
How is that gonna
happen if it was the fuckin'

39:22.128 --> 39:24.062
sheriff who pulled the trigger?

39:24.097 --> 39:27.604
- Especially if it was
the fuckin' sheriff... right?

39:28.805 --> 39:32.576
We all gotta play by the same
rules if this is gonna work.

39:36.175 --> 39:37.713
Where is the sheriff,
right now?

39:39.618 --> 39:43.554
Probably Florida or something,
tanning his pasty ass.

39:43.589 --> 39:46.458
Right.
But he's not here.

39:48.627 --> 39:52.992
No one here was involved
with your cousin's shooting.

39:54.061 --> 39:55.467
Correct?

39:59.506 --> 40:00.703
Okay.

40:05.941 --> 40:07.479
Now, we'll get out of your way.

40:08.944 --> 40:10.141
There's no harm done.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.948
And I'm sorry for your family.

40:49.787 --> 40:52.051
- Well,
that was a big success.

40:52.086 --> 40:54.592
Really glad
you came along today.

40:55.122 --> 40:57.595
I told you that around here,

40:57.630 --> 41:00.191
contacting authorities
only makes things worse.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.062
Then what is the point of you?

41:03.900 --> 41:05.900
What exactly do you do?

41:05.935 --> 41:08.738
Yeah, why don't you tell me how
to do my job? That'd be great.

41:08.773 --> 41:10.905
I don't feel
safe in my own house.

41:12.007 --> 41:14.975
I should be able to
call the police and have

41:15.010 --> 41:17.175
the confidence that my
concerns will be addressed.

41:17.210 --> 41:18.880
Ma'am, there isn't enough law

41:18.915 --> 41:21.245
in this whole state
to make you feel safe.

41:21.819 --> 41:23.918
Now, you want to live
out in the middle of a canyon,

41:23.953 --> 41:25.788
you're on your own.

41:25.823 --> 41:27.658
And if you can't handle that,
I hear they're putting

41:27.693 --> 41:29.187
up some nice condos
over by the college.

41:29.959 --> 41:31.893

Chapter six, verse 25.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.814
"Therefore, I tell you,
do not worry about your life,

50:17.849 --> 50:21.488
what you will eat or drink
or about your body.

50:21.523 --> 50:22.852
What you will wear.

50:22.887 --> 50:25.162
Is not life more than food

50:25.197 --> 50:27.494

more than clothes?"

50:27.529 --> 50:28.792
You believe in this stuff?

50:30.796 --> 50:33.632
I did, once.
Yeah.

50:37.374 --> 50:40.837
Come here for her.
Make her happy.

50:40.872 --> 50:44.643
Yeah.
I know all about that.

50:51.652 --> 50:54.686
She put up
with a lot of shit in her life.

50:58.164 --> 51:00.197
She got used to being unhappy.

51:03.202 --> 51:04.234
Yeah.

51:07.206 --> 51:08.436
Yeah.

51:08.471 --> 51:09.866
My mother had that.

51:13.608 --> 51:17.148
She never forgave me
for bringing her up here.

51:17.183 --> 51:19.150
She hated the cold.

51:20.780 --> 51:23.187
Everyone hates the cold.

51:24.619 --> 51:26.454
I wish she could hear you
say that.

51:28.722 --> 51:30.755
My mother was never content.

51:33.331 --> 51:35.793
She'd hold onto stuff
that happened 20 years ago,

1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:19.194
of our department
to try to be more inclusive.

1:13:22.606 --> 1:13:25.134

And now that
we have our list,

1:13:30.713 --> 1:13:33.483
it's important that
we all rally behind it.

1:13:33.518 --> 1:13:35.947

budget to stall appointments

1:13:35.982 --> 1:13:37.751

with our department.

1:13:42.758 --> 1:13:44.692

1:14:03.779 --> 1:14:05.746
Excuse me for one second.

1:14:05.781 --> 1:14:08.782
I thought we said that
we would try to recommend

1:14:08.817 --> 1:14:11.620
at least one person
of color to the dean.

1:14:11.655 --> 1:14:14.755
On the contrary,
we explicitly said

1:14:14.790 --> 1:14:16.251
that this was not
about filling a quota.

1:14:16.286 --> 1:14:17.692
That's not what I'm saying.

1:14:17.727 --> 1:14:19.056

just said that--

1:14:19.091 --> 1:14:20.959

you're not listening to me.

1:14:20.994 --> 1:14:22.697
No, I'm pretty sure you
understand the concept of--

1:14:22.732 --> 1:14:24.567
I said that
we should try to recommend.

1:14:24.602 --> 1:14:26.800

1:14:26.835 --> 1:14:28.637
That's all.

1:14:28.672 --> 1:14:31.200
One name on a list of three,
and we can't do that?

1:14:31.235 --> 1:14:33.576
So, a quota.

1:14:33.611 --> 1:14:36.040
We had options, Arthur.

1:14:36.075 --> 1:14:37.305
And we agreed
it was important.

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:41.144
-You said that. Right?
-Yes.

1:14:41.179 --> 1:14:43.245
I don't know where you're
going with this, Sandra.

1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:46.556
I'm trying to remind you--

1:14:46.591 --> 1:14:48.217
I'm 100% confident
that we considered everyone--

1:14:48.252 --> 1:14:50.153
I'm trying to express
what we agreed--

1:14:50.188 --> 1:14:51.759
Sandra,
this is not about you.

1:14:51.794 --> 1:14:53.728
Oh, I know
this is not about me.

1:14:53.763 --> 1:14:57.028
This is about hiring the best
person for the job. Period.

1:14:57.063 --> 1:14:59.767
But if everyone
on the list is white,

1:14:59.802 --> 1:15:02.704
-then how are we supposed to--
-Sandra. It's over.

1:15:03.905 --> 1:15:05.267
The process was fair!

1:15:05.302 --> 1:15:07.940
Now it's over
and we are moving on.

1:15:07.975 --> 1:15:10.679
I will not allow the dean to
cut this department to ribbons

1:15:10.714 --> 1:15:12.747
because we got distracted
by identity politics.

1:15:12.782 --> 1:15:14.881
-Identity politics?
-Yeah. Not on my watch.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:17.213
And quite frankly, I take great
offense that you're reading

1:15:17.248 --> 1:15:19.787
-some kind of bias into this.
-This is how it happens.

1:15:19.822 --> 1:15:21.723
Right here is
how it all breaks down--

1:15:21.758 --> 1:15:23.593
You know what,
spare me--

1:15:23.628 --> 1:15:25.628

1:15:25.663 --> 1:15:27.630
And now you're mad that you
didn't get what you wanted.

1:15:27.665 --> 1:15:29.126
We say we care
about right and wrong--

1:15:29.161 --> 1:15:30.831
-How dare you?
-But in the end, it's really

1:15:30.866 --> 1:15:32.668

isn't it?

1:15:32.703 --> 1:15:36.266

I hear you pulled a muscle.

1:16:02.095 --> 1:16:04.733
Think you need to take

1:16:04.768 --> 1:16:07.329
some time to yourself,
maybe take the next term off!

1:16:07.364 --> 1:16:09.001

1:16:24.315 --> 1:16:26.315
Come on.
We're going to the Dean.

1:16:26.350 --> 1:16:27.987
We have to go right now.

1:16:28.022 --> 1:16:30.055
What?
What are you talking...

1:16:30.090 --> 1:16:33.190
We cannot let them get away
with this. Not anymore.

1:16:33.225 --> 1:16:35.764
We have to fight back
every time.

1:16:35.799 --> 1:16:38.228
All the time or this
is going to go on forever.

1:16:38.263 --> 1:16:40.736
Did you say something?

1:16:48.812 --> 1:16:50.240
What did you say?

1:16:56.380 --> 1:16:58.754
I didn't say your name.

1:17:06.159 --> 1:17:09.094
I thought you understood
how hard I worked to get here.

1:17:09.129 --> 1:17:12.702
Gretchen. I--
Believe me, I do.

1:17:12.737 --> 1:17:14.803
But you have a right
to be angry.

1:17:14.838 --> 1:17:17.300
And you shouldn't punish
yourself

1:17:17.335 --> 1:17:20.138
for something
that's not your fault.

1:17:20.173 --> 1:17:22.943
Is that
what you think I'm doing?

1:17:27.246 --> 1:17:30.918
Ladies,
everything all right?

1:17:39.357 --> 1:17:42.259
I'm so... Sorry.

1:17:55.912 --> 1:17:58.077
I need to apologize
for my behavior.

1:18:01.082 --> 1:18:05.480
What I said was completely
out of line.

1:18:05.515 --> 1:18:07.515
And you're right.

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:10.287
I should probably
take some time off.

1:19:57.264 --> 1:20:01.497
Hey, fellas!
How'd you do?

1:20:01.532 --> 1:20:05.237

I really need you

Yeah,
shut the fuck up, huh?

I'm so tired of you.

Come back anytime, baby.

You come back here again,
I'll fucking kill you.

I'll fucking kill you.
