00:08.343 --> 00:11.678
FRANK GALLAGHER: Tickets this way for the Chatsworth Express!

00:11.783 --> 00:16.160
Come and watch pikeys making a mess of the lives

00:16.264 --> 00:22.066
they were given by him upstairs and kids they're convinced

00:22.170 --> 00:23.386
aren't actually theirs.

00:23.491 --> 00:27.868
What sounds on Earth could ever replace kids needing

00:27.973 --> 00:30.440
money or wives in your face?

00:30.544 --> 00:33.149
'cos this, people reckon, and me included,

00:33.253 --> 00:36.589
is why pubs and drugs were kindly

00:36.693 --> 00:42.981
invented to calm us all down and stop us going mental.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.838
These are Chatsworth Estate's basic essentials.

00:46.943 --> 00:51.320
We are worth every penny for grinding your axes.

00:51.423 --> 00:55.594
You shit on our heads, but you pay the taxes.

00:59.588 --> 01:03.167
Imagine a Britain without Chatsworth buccaneers

01:03.271 --> 01:06.329
who'd cum on your face for the price of a beer.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.309
Make poverty history.

01:08.414 --> 01:10.775
Cheaper drugs now!

01:10.881 --> 01:13.382
Make poverty history.

01:13.486 --> 01:14.772
Cheaper drugs now!

01:14.876 --> 01:18.420
[laughs] Scatter!

01:18.523 --> 01:19.357
Party!

01:28.426 --> 01:30.753
MONICA (VOICEOVER): I wrote a poem.

01:30.857 --> 01:35.270
There was a young woman from Chatsworth who had dreams,

01:35.374 --> 01:38.918
ambitions, and older stuff.

01:39.023 --> 01:43.087
But she lost her good cheer and ended up here.

01:49.758 --> 01:52.050
But I can't finish it.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.823
Can't think of the last line.

01:53.927 --> 01:55.733
Frank.

01:55.838 --> 01:57.228
She's gone over.

01:57.332 --> 01:59.695
We've got time.

01:59.799 --> 02:00.771
Don't need any foreplay.

02:00.875 --> 02:02.544
I can get meself going.

02:02.648 --> 02:05.357
Quick in and out will do.

02:05.462 --> 02:08.449
Yeah, yeah, go on.

02:08.553 --> 02:09.699
Knock yourself out.

02:12.896 --> 02:14.216
[snores]

02:14.321 --> 02:15.433
Oh, Christ.

02:18.074 --> 02:18.942
CARL (OFFSCREEN) Uhh.

02:19.047 --> 02:20.818
Come on!

02:20.922 --> 02:23.354
At least somebody's getting some.

02:23.458 --> 02:26.412
[stella starts crying]

02:38.954 --> 02:39.788
Come on!

02:42.810 --> 02:44.062
[knock on door]

02:44.166 --> 02:44.999
DEBBIE: Carl!

02:45.103 --> 02:46.772
Fuck off!

02:46.876 --> 02:48.717
I'm touching cloth here!

02:48.821 --> 02:50.315
I'm having a piss!

02:50.419 --> 02:52.365
What for 40 minutes?

02:52.469 --> 02:53.338
Really?

02:53.442 --> 02:55.318
It's been 40 minutes?

02:55.423 --> 02:56.917
DEBBIE: Duh!

02:57.021 --> 02:59.730
Yeah, well, I've got a big bladder.

02:59.835 --> 03:00.772
Ugh, Carl!

03:04.004 --> 03:04.976
MAN: That's your lot.

03:05.081 --> 03:05.949
You'll have to wait.

03:06.054 --> 03:07.200
I can't find the gin.

03:07.304 --> 03:08.624
Down there on the left.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.990
Feel free to roll your tongue back in.

03:16.094 --> 03:17.831
Suppose there's no chance of a quickie?

03:17.935 --> 03:19.638
Go on, for old times' sake?

03:19.742 --> 03:20.819
I'm a married woman.

03:20.924 --> 03:22.974
Not even a hand-job?

03:23.078 --> 03:24.745
MANDY: Not unless you want to take your knob home

03:24.850 --> 03:26.517
to your missus in a jiffy bag.

03:26.621 --> 03:28.011
The sister-in-law?

03:28.116 --> 03:30.130
Shut up.

03:30.234 --> 03:31.277
He's harmless.

03:34.717 --> 03:37.670
Listen I wanted to ask.

03:37.774 --> 03:41.491
You don't mind if I have someone stay over Friday night?

03:41.595 --> 03:42.464
Course not.

03:42.568 --> 03:44.028
Why would I?

03:44.133 --> 03:46.842
No.

03:46.947 --> 03:49.239
Right.

03:49.343 --> 03:51.810
Stay over.

03:51.915 --> 03:52.818
Course.

03:52.922 --> 03:55.007
You live there, and all.

03:55.111 --> 03:58.342
It's the first time, you know.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.593
Fuck off!

03:59.697 --> 04:01.261
You haven't shagged him yet?

04:01.364 --> 04:03.241
What are you, a nun?

04:03.346 --> 04:05.499
Is it compulsory to use your knickers as ankle warmers

04:05.602 --> 04:07.132
on your first date, these days?

04:07.236 --> 04:08.348
All right!

04:08.452 --> 04:10.641
No need to get your chastity belt in a twist.

04:10.745 --> 04:12.344
Not another word from me.

04:12.448 --> 04:14.150
Any road, better get our skates on.

04:17.207 --> 04:18.076
Carl!

04:18.180 --> 04:19.326
MAXINE: All right, sexy?

04:19.430 --> 04:21.202
Joined Randall and Hopkirk, have we?

04:21.305 --> 04:24.191
Fuck off, I'm late.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.546
Thought we were going in town?

04:25.649 --> 04:27.039
Yeah, I've got nothing to wear.

04:27.144 --> 04:29.333
You've got nothing to wear to go clothes shopping.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.861
Got no money, either.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.946
Do you wanna eat this toast or wear it?

04:33.050 --> 04:34.960
Battle of the sexes, gorgeous.

04:35.065 --> 04:37.045
By the you're old enough to realize you're in a war,

04:37.149 --> 04:38.332
you've already lost it.

04:38.435 --> 04:39.826
What is it with girls and touching?

04:39.929 --> 04:41.979
You don't always have to be touching.

04:42.084 --> 04:44.064
And you shouldn't be shoplifting either.

04:44.168 --> 04:45.071
FRANK: All right, son?

04:45.175 --> 04:46.044
LIAM: No.

04:46.148 --> 04:47.051
Good.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.170
MAXINE: All right, Mr. G?

04:49.275 --> 04:50.109
Pleased to see me?

04:53.062 --> 04:54.903
Careful what you wish for, cheeky.

04:55.008 --> 04:55.876
Oh, yeah?

04:55.981 --> 04:58.865
So now you're feeling frisky?

04:58.969 --> 05:02.270
Well, it's-- it's just a laugh.

05:02.374 --> 05:03.207
Five minutes.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.413
Show some respect!

05:21.517 --> 05:22.664
I hate this.

05:22.767 --> 05:23.949
Gives me creeps.

05:24.053 --> 05:25.651
Don't worry.

05:25.755 --> 05:28.778
Scrappy Doo will protect ya.

05:28.882 --> 05:30.307
It's an annual pilgrimage.

05:30.412 --> 05:34.163
Mimi sits here all day, we get excused after an hour.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.456
I'm all dressed up so's I can stand out here,

05:36.560 --> 05:38.680
freezing me knackers off for an hour.

05:38.784 --> 05:40.799
Apparently blood's thicker than water.

05:40.903 --> 05:43.302
It's not thicker than fucking voddie, though, is it?

05:43.405 --> 05:44.829
[laughs]

05:46.322 --> 05:48.442
What for?

05:48.547 --> 05:50.492
All right, speak to you later.

05:50.597 --> 05:51.465
State of him.

05:54.974 --> 05:55.877
Hey.

05:55.982 --> 05:57.511
Saw that new girl of yours.

05:57.616 --> 05:59.769
Only went into the shop for a pint of milk and there she is.

05:59.872 --> 06:03.451
I mean, for a hooker, all that fucking hair.

06:03.555 --> 06:04.702
Biggest turn off going.

06:04.807 --> 06:06.718
It's about as sexy as a pig in a skirt.

06:06.822 --> 06:07.898
MIMI: What the fuck!?

06:10.539 --> 06:14.605
It's all right, mum, we'll fix it.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.828
Look at how upset it's making him!

06:16.932 --> 06:18.357
He's not grieving, he's hungover.

06:21.067 --> 06:21.935
Clear it up.

06:22.038 --> 06:24.437
Now.

06:24.541 --> 06:26.174
Now.

06:26.277 --> 06:27.146
Now!

06:39.931 --> 06:41.704
Fuck!

06:41.808 --> 06:42.676
Sorry!

06:46.603 --> 06:48.618
I was bringing you a cuppa.

06:48.722 --> 06:52.127
See if I could work in some small talk.

06:52.231 --> 06:53.585
I think we've gone beyond that.

07:00.396 --> 07:01.368
Fuck! Shit!

07:01.473 --> 07:02.410
Stop!

07:02.516 --> 07:04.669
What?

07:04.773 --> 07:05.850
I didn't know.

07:05.955 --> 07:07.205
I'm sorry! - What?

07:07.309 --> 07:08.525
Ew, he's not my bloke.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.324
He's my brother.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.505
We share the house!

07:10.610 --> 07:12.833
Hurry up before I lose me erection.

07:12.938 --> 07:14.119
Well.

07:14.223 --> 07:15.336
Won't it be weird?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.933
Him being there?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.053
Since when was watching against the law?

07:28.433 --> 07:29.961
It's a fucking joke!

07:30.066 --> 07:31.769
Not family enough to visit grave,

07:31.873 --> 07:32.984
but it's all hands to pump when it

07:33.089 --> 07:34.722
comes to scrubbing the bastard.

07:34.826 --> 07:35.763
SHANE: It's 'cos you're girls.

07:35.869 --> 07:37.709
You do a better job.

07:37.814 --> 07:39.238
Don't, Karen, I'll throw up again.

07:39.342 --> 07:40.558
- We're leaving. - Lightweight.

07:40.662 --> 07:41.705
Fuck off, Micky.

07:46.639 --> 07:48.063
You sure you'll be all right?

07:51.780 --> 07:54.699
This can never happen again.

07:54.802 --> 07:57.027
PADDY: It won't, angel.

07:57.131 --> 07:58.208
I promise.

08:05.990 --> 08:06.860
Here you go.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.625
- It's only 20. - I know.

08:12.731 --> 08:14.538
Weather we're having, expect I'll need done

08:14.642 --> 08:15.614
again before the week's out.

08:15.718 --> 08:16.552
No problem.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.794
I said to your dad, no way that's a turkey, Me but Bernie

08:25.899 --> 08:28.469
the butcher swore by it.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.214
Suppose they do look similar, though.

08:31.318 --> 08:32.152
Plucked.

08:32.256 --> 08:35.347
A turkey and a swan.

08:35.453 --> 08:37.224
So not the best Christmas.

08:49.836 --> 08:51.956
Poor cow.

08:52.060 --> 08:54.943
Why is it always the mothers that bear the burden?

09:00.537 --> 09:02.621
FRANK: Come on, having a bite here.

09:02.725 --> 09:04.046
You can have a bite of me.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.946
I've got sauce on me now.

09:12.559 --> 09:14.539
What?

09:14.643 --> 09:16.589
What?

09:16.693 --> 09:19.090
I want--

09:19.194 --> 09:21.453
I need a bit of intimacy.

09:21.557 --> 09:24.580
I'm not just a fucking baby machine.

09:24.684 --> 09:26.490
Yeah, but, you know, the timing's wrong.

09:26.594 --> 09:29.479
Yeah, timing's always wrong.

09:29.583 --> 09:33.821
Like-- no, I mean, you still, you know, cutting

09:33.926 --> 09:35.593
a bit of baby fat, aren't you?

09:35.697 --> 09:37.643
So I would've thought you--

09:37.747 --> 09:42.473
you wouldn't, you wouldn't flaunt it.

09:42.576 --> 09:43.410
I'm still a woman!

09:43.514 --> 09:45.008
I still need love!

09:45.113 --> 09:47.718
Seven kids I've given ya!

09:47.822 --> 09:50.985
When have I ever cast it up?

09:51.089 --> 09:52.860
Ever?

09:52.964 --> 09:54.458
MONICA (SHOUTING): You bastard!

09:54.563 --> 09:56.473
[glass breaking]

09:56.578 --> 09:57.933
[pots clattering]

09:58.037 --> 09:59.253
Hey!

09:59.357 --> 10:01.163
Nobody's saying you got to be Liz Hurley.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.588
MONICA: Fuck you, you fucker!

10:02.692 --> 10:04.708
Well, you're not eating for two anymore, are you?

10:04.811 --> 10:09.085
MONICA: I'll fucking show you fucking love handles!

10:09.190 --> 10:11.101
Would you rather I lied to you?

10:11.204 --> 10:14.262
Piss off, you twat!

10:14.366 --> 10:16.520
Oh, here we go, another pair.

10:16.625 --> 10:19.091
Female of the species, victims of biology

10:19.195 --> 10:21.698
and the unbearable lightness of shopping.

10:21.802 --> 10:23.052
Oh, and whose fault is it?

10:23.156 --> 10:25.275
Societal pressure created by men!

10:36.428 --> 10:38.930
Oh, come on, then!

10:39.034 --> 10:42.057
What's the view from the leaf-blowing brigade?

10:42.161 --> 10:44.419
You really are a useless prick, aren't you?

10:44.524 --> 10:45.843
I'm not.

10:45.948 --> 10:47.199
Just think what that woman's given up for you?

10:47.303 --> 10:48.137
What?

10:48.241 --> 10:49.179
You?

10:49.283 --> 10:51.750
Giant fucking Yoda in a shell suit?

10:51.854 --> 10:57.691
That's right, revert to your default position: abusive.

10:57.795 --> 10:59.844
Don't examine your own behavior, whatever you do,

10:59.949 --> 11:02.624
'cause you're a great catch, aren't you, Frank?

11:02.729 --> 11:06.898
Husband, helper, lover.

11:07.002 --> 11:09.399
You're gonna lose her.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.372
No, I'm not.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.390
Hey.

11:17.495 --> 11:19.996
Don't fucking laugh at me.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.664
Because it's the lowest form of wit.

11:25.450 --> 11:26.562
You mind?

11:26.666 --> 11:28.091
The ladies' loos are flooded.

11:28.195 --> 11:29.064
No.

11:39.903 --> 11:40.738
Sorry.

11:40.842 --> 11:42.544
I don't really need to go.

11:42.648 --> 11:43.829
It's just--

11:43.935 --> 11:45.289
What?

11:45.393 --> 11:48.764
When was the last time you did a bit of gardening?

11:54.357 --> 11:56.336
I know it's none of my business, but it's

11:56.442 --> 12:00.333
your big day on Friday, and I know it's been a long time,

12:00.437 --> 12:01.688
and Joe said--

12:01.792 --> 12:02.904
Joe said what?

12:03.008 --> 12:04.571
About as sexy is a pig in a skirt.

12:04.674 --> 12:06.621
That he doesn't like hairy women.

12:06.726 --> 12:11.102
They're totally disgusting and it makes him want to puke.

12:11.206 --> 12:12.736
MANDY: A fucking barbie doll?

12:12.840 --> 12:14.855
Smooth bump at the front?

12:14.959 --> 12:16.245
It's natural!

12:16.349 --> 12:19.684
What kind of person thinks body hair is disgusting?

12:19.788 --> 12:21.630
A massive turn off?

12:21.734 --> 12:24.687
The hoops we fucking jump through.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.494
I just thought you'd want to know!

12:33.998 --> 12:34.867
All right, mate?

12:34.971 --> 12:35.805
Yeah, grind.

12:40.253 --> 12:41.747
What?

12:41.850 --> 12:43.623
Well, this is really fucking weird because she's my sister,

12:43.727 --> 12:48.001
but, well I know it's your big night Friday.

12:48.105 --> 12:50.710
She doesn't like hairy men.

12:50.814 --> 12:51.856
What?

12:51.960 --> 12:53.594
She doesn't like men with hair.

12:53.698 --> 12:54.532
What you mean--

12:54.637 --> 12:56.026
Jesus no!

12:56.129 --> 12:58.943
It'd look like a one turkey plucked and ready for the oven.

12:59.048 --> 13:00.995
Your chest.

13:01.098 --> 13:02.522
Well, I've seen you after games.

13:02.627 --> 13:05.094
You're not exactly lacking are ya?

13:05.198 --> 13:06.344
She really hates it?

13:06.448 --> 13:07.282
Heh.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.603
Disgusts her.

13:08.707 --> 13:10.271
Doesn't think she could be with a hairy guy.

13:13.397 --> 13:14.232
Sorry, man.

13:19.129 --> 13:20.658
How was that?

13:20.762 --> 13:23.507
Stanley Waterman, if muff diving

13:23.612 --> 13:27.537
were an Olympic sport you'd be a national fucking hero.

13:27.642 --> 13:29.588
What, do you hang weights off your tongue?

13:29.692 --> 13:31.325
Your turn.

13:31.429 --> 13:32.958
I'm knackered, Stan.

13:33.062 --> 13:37.162
There's no way I could work up the energy.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.351
If you don't mind me saying, but you always seem

13:39.455 --> 13:40.984
knackered when it's my turn, these days.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.755
Am I?

13:42.860 --> 13:46.438
It's you're own fault. You're too blooming good.

13:46.543 --> 13:47.411
Yvonne.

13:50.052 --> 13:50.920
Yvonne?

13:51.025 --> 13:54.568
It's the wart, Stan.

13:54.671 --> 13:55.992
The wart.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.348
I thought you hadn't noticed.

13:57.452 --> 13:58.841
Noticed?

13:58.945 --> 14:01.482
It's almost had me eye out five times.

14:01.586 --> 14:05.859
It's like your bellend's grown another head.

14:05.963 --> 14:08.708
It's only a wart, love.

14:08.813 --> 14:10.202
They can easily be removed.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.140
Like a verruca.

14:11.244 --> 14:12.287
Tsst.

14:20.313 --> 14:21.285
It's rubbish innit?

14:21.389 --> 14:22.432
No.

14:22.535 --> 14:24.968
It's just this bit about "running

14:25.072 --> 14:27.469
his tongue around her burning Volvo"

14:27.574 --> 14:29.381
it's a typing error, right?

14:29.485 --> 14:30.666
I use check.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.194
I'm no good with the Latin words.

14:32.299 --> 14:34.939
And same when she gives him a "blow-dry."

14:35.043 --> 14:36.573
No, I mean that.

14:36.677 --> 14:38.483
- She's a hairdresser. - Oh

14:38.588 --> 14:39.491
Oh, you's hate it.

14:39.595 --> 14:40.464
No, we don't.

14:40.568 --> 14:41.471
It's just--

14:41.575 --> 14:42.513
ZETA: It's a bit gay, Micky.

14:42.617 --> 14:45.084
How is this gay?

14:45.188 --> 14:47.273
"He bent her over the cement mixer,

14:47.378 --> 14:50.017
spread her ass cheeks wide, and slid the length

14:50.123 --> 14:51.616
of his girder inside.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.283
The only sound interrupting her moans

14:53.388 --> 14:55.959
was the rattle of her hard hat inside the empty mixer

14:56.062 --> 14:57.869
as it went round and round and around.

14:57.974 --> 14:59.085
It's a building site.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.302
So?

15:00.406 --> 15:02.421
You get women builders.

15:02.524 --> 15:04.853
Straight or not, I'm as wet as a fisherman's sou'wester just

15:04.957 --> 15:05.652
listening to it.

15:05.757 --> 15:07.736
Upstairs, the pair of you.

15:11.732 --> 15:14.199
Sorry about that.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.414
It's all right.

15:15.519 --> 15:16.978
Happens.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.793
It's just bad timing.

15:19.897 --> 15:22.086
You two coming first again.

15:24.622 --> 15:26.325
She's not stupid, you know.

15:26.429 --> 15:28.688
She must be if she thinks you're still in the closet.

15:28.792 --> 15:29.452
Shut up.

15:29.556 --> 15:30.737
[water running]

15:30.841 --> 15:32.961
That's how you're into swinging, innit?

15:33.065 --> 15:35.114
A poof dropped in a straight marriage?

15:35.218 --> 15:36.087
Hey!

15:36.191 --> 15:38.172
I'm not a poof!

15:38.276 --> 15:39.630
Yeah?

15:39.735 --> 15:41.923
So how come you've got a stiffy as soon as she left the room?

15:46.197 --> 15:48.907
I love her.

15:49.011 --> 15:54.189
When was the last time you had straight sex with her?

15:54.293 --> 15:57.523
Micky, I think I love you, too.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.510
Well, tomorrow, we'll have this out.

16:09.613 --> 16:10.517
The three of us.

16:18.230 --> 16:20.837
What are you doing?

16:20.941 --> 16:22.991
I am helping.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.653
Oh, fuck's sake!

16:28.757 --> 16:30.321
Looking foxy, Mrs. G.

16:30.425 --> 16:31.363
Thank you, Maxine.

16:37.270 --> 16:39.806
[stella starts crying]

16:41.334 --> 16:43.489
What's with your mum?

16:43.593 --> 16:44.843
General or specific?

16:44.948 --> 16:46.928
General, she wasn't born into the royal family.

16:47.032 --> 16:49.048
Specific, she's 43 going on 14.

16:52.417 --> 16:53.634
I'm pissing!

16:53.738 --> 16:56.274
What, all day, every day?

16:56.378 --> 16:57.247
Debs, wait.

17:01.798 --> 17:05.863
I'll just unload, shall I?

17:05.968 --> 17:06.974
I can't piss.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.260
Well you're getting plenty of practice.

17:08.364 --> 17:12.847
No, I mean, I can't piss.

17:12.951 --> 17:14.896
A little bit comes out, but it hurts like fuck.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.016
And it itches all the time.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.474
Use a condom, don't you?

17:18.579 --> 17:21.115
'Course I do.

17:21.219 --> 17:23.478
Usually. - You've got an STD.

17:23.582 --> 17:24.451
Have I?

17:24.554 --> 17:25.214
Fuck!

17:25.318 --> 17:27.231
Fine, you haven't.

17:27.335 --> 17:28.794
What should I do?

17:28.897 --> 17:31.816
Clinic.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.310
No way!

17:33.415 --> 17:36.542
[water running]

17:39.911 --> 17:42.031
[liam playing]

17:42.135 --> 17:44.463
[banging]

17:46.583 --> 17:47.416
LIAM: I'm OK.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.284
Everything's fine.

17:48.389 --> 17:50.786
[stella starts crying]

17:50.890 --> 17:51.758
Oh, fuck!

17:59.054 --> 18:02.077
Shut up, Stella!

18:02.181 --> 18:04.649
LILLIAN: All right, love? - Yeah.

18:04.753 --> 18:06.246
Thanks, Lillian.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.825
If you don't mind me saying, you're looking a bit mental.

18:09.929 --> 18:11.458
Am I?

18:11.562 --> 18:14.238
You sure you haven't got some of that post-natal depression?

18:14.342 --> 18:16.808
She could be right, you know, Monica.

18:16.913 --> 18:18.303
You don't seem quite yourself.

18:18.407 --> 18:20.942
And what is meself, then Yvonne?

18:21.047 --> 18:23.549
Dressing like a sofa and munching down HRT,

18:23.653 --> 18:25.668
because I'm past me sell-by date?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.232
Don't be soft!

18:27.336 --> 18:30.428
Bosom's like these, you've got 20 years of good handling

18:30.532 --> 18:31.610
in you, yet.

18:31.713 --> 18:33.590
I'm not mental just because I want

18:33.694 --> 18:37.237
to be treated like a woman.

18:37.343 --> 18:39.704
You can probably take your hands off now, Lillian.

18:49.015 --> 18:51.969
LILLIAN: They were persecuted in ancient times, hypnotists.

18:52.073 --> 18:55.929
Folk used to think it were black magic.

18:56.033 --> 18:59.021
MONICA: It's probably just a tacky sex show.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.759
Pub hypnotists, they're all the same.

19:00.863 --> 19:02.044
NORMA: So you're not going?

19:02.148 --> 19:03.086
Oh yeah!

19:03.190 --> 19:03.990
I'm going to get there early.

19:04.094 --> 19:05.657
Get seat down front.

19:05.761 --> 19:09.027
It's a science of the future, mind control.

19:09.132 --> 19:10.452
Some people even see it as an art.

19:10.556 --> 19:12.155
Who's to say?

19:12.259 --> 19:14.135
The paying fucking public.

19:14.239 --> 19:15.838
Seven quid a ticket.

19:15.941 --> 19:17.262
He better be an artist.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.964
They used to think Houdini hypnotized his self

19:19.068 --> 19:21.013
so he could hold his breath.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.751
Until he drowned, of course.

19:22.855 --> 19:24.836
Then the theory lost some of its credibility.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.712
Our mum was hypnotized once.

19:26.816 --> 19:30.255
Wonder if that's why she thinks she's a Scouser.

19:30.359 --> 19:32.028
She is a fucking Scouser!

19:32.132 --> 19:34.668
'Course all art is subjective.

19:34.772 --> 19:37.343
You know that tennis poster of the year?

19:37.447 --> 19:40.748
Of the lass lifting her skirt to scratch

19:40.853 --> 19:45.682
a single perfect round buttock.

19:45.786 --> 19:46.688
We have to go.

19:46.793 --> 19:47.696
I've still got half me pint.

19:47.801 --> 19:48.669
Now!

19:48.773 --> 19:50.475
Classic image that is.

19:50.580 --> 19:54.749
KAREN: I used me dad's razor the first time I did it.

19:54.854 --> 19:56.452
Using aftershave and all.

19:56.557 --> 20:00.203
That was a once only experiment.

20:00.308 --> 20:02.080
You sure you've done this before?

20:02.185 --> 20:03.401
Yeah!

20:03.505 --> 20:05.485
One summer, I did me mate's like the faces

20:05.589 --> 20:06.944
of the Take That Boys.

20:07.048 --> 20:08.717
Except Gary Barlow, of course.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.557
She must have been a hairy girl.

20:10.661 --> 20:12.051
Not really.

20:12.156 --> 20:13.163
Mark Owen's only little.

20:13.267 --> 20:14.657
Maybe I should go to a salon.

20:14.762 --> 20:17.124
And drop 40 quid to let some spotty teenager stare up

20:17.229 --> 20:18.096
your muff?

20:18.201 --> 20:19.903
Come on, get 'em off!

20:23.691 --> 20:25.636
Are you sure this is the best way to do it?

20:25.741 --> 20:26.956
How should I know?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.354
Not my missus who's got a fetish for baldy.

20:29.458 --> 20:30.674
It's not natural, though, is it?

20:30.779 --> 20:33.209
Yeah, blame Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.

20:33.314 --> 20:35.225
We live in the era of the girly man.

20:35.329 --> 20:37.378
Yeah, well, I'd fucking hate to look like that.

20:40.923 --> 20:41.896
Can you do it?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.390
Fuck right off!

20:43.494 --> 20:45.648
I can't get the angles right, looking in the mirror.

20:54.091 --> 20:55.375
Nobody gets to hear about this.

20:59.337 --> 21:00.866
DEBBIE: That's half my wardrobe, Liam!

21:00.969 --> 21:02.567
These aren't stolen!

21:02.672 --> 21:04.166
[stella crying]

21:04.270 --> 21:06.112
I don't want them in the house, it's bad karma.

21:12.921 --> 21:14.415
Who the fuck?

21:17.960 --> 21:19.349
What you doing?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.469
Assisting.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.135
Being less than useless.

21:23.239 --> 21:24.769
More importantly, what the fuck is

21:24.873 --> 21:28.764
this garment doing in my house didn't we bring 'em up right?

21:28.868 --> 21:29.737
I don't care.

21:36.407 --> 21:37.277
MANDY: Ah!

21:37.380 --> 21:41.758
Holy god, it hurts!

21:41.862 --> 21:43.252
Everything all right?

21:43.356 --> 21:44.364
Yeah.

21:44.467 --> 21:45.301
You?

21:45.406 --> 21:47.351
Fine.

21:47.456 --> 21:48.740
What are you up to?

21:48.846 --> 21:51.417
Nothing.

21:51.521 --> 21:52.389
You?

21:52.493 --> 21:54.370
Not much.

21:54.473 --> 21:55.968
You said you'd done this before.

21:56.072 --> 21:57.011
I have.

21:57.115 --> 21:58.886
Just been a while, that's all.

21:58.991 --> 22:00.171
Thought you were an expert.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.534
Did you mate's with the Take That boys.

22:02.638 --> 22:04.793
I never said it was a good likeness.

22:04.897 --> 22:07.642
Feels like you used sticky sandpaper.

22:07.746 --> 22:09.379
I think I'm bleeding.

22:09.482 --> 22:10.803
Don't be so soft.

22:10.907 --> 22:13.026
Women have suffered abuse since the dawn of time

22:13.131 --> 22:15.354
and you've only just started.

22:15.458 --> 22:17.857
Get back.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.906
Christ almighty!

22:20.010 --> 22:20.879
Jamie?

22:20.983 --> 22:22.407
Something wrong?

22:22.512 --> 22:23.693
No.

22:23.796 --> 22:25.049
Sound as a pound.

22:25.152 --> 22:27.445
OK.

22:27.549 --> 22:29.704
Nipple, I think you cut it off.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.058
You shouldn't twitch so much.

22:31.162 --> 22:32.691
Well, no wonder with the barber of fucking

22:32.795 --> 22:34.567
Seville shaving me chest.

22:34.671 --> 22:36.270
Oh, don't be such a baby.

22:36.374 --> 22:37.243
It's only a nipple.

22:37.346 --> 22:40.092
You've got another one.

22:40.196 --> 22:41.620
KELLY: Your brother fancies me.

22:41.725 --> 22:43.705
He wants to fucking do me, and not straight on and off,

22:43.809 --> 22:44.678
either.

22:44.782 --> 22:46.727
He wants to spank me.

22:46.832 --> 22:49.334
You can't hurt him, Shane, he's your brother.

22:49.437 --> 22:51.591
I'm not gonna hurt him.

22:51.696 --> 22:54.475
I feel sorry for him.

22:54.579 --> 22:55.899
I'm not sure how to take that.

22:56.003 --> 22:57.428
No, I mean.

22:57.533 --> 22:59.340
I don't blame him.

22:59.443 --> 23:00.832
How could he not fancy you?

23:00.937 --> 23:05.384
Karen's a nice girl, and all, but she'll never be you.

23:05.488 --> 23:06.635
You're taking the piss.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.817
No.

23:07.921 --> 23:09.171
You could be a model.

23:09.276 --> 23:11.638
In fact, you make half the models in magazines

23:11.742 --> 23:12.716
look like dogs.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.835
I do own a mirror, Shane.

23:14.939 --> 23:19.178
And, while it tells me that, yes, I am a fucking knockout,

23:19.282 --> 23:20.324
I don't think Kate Moss should be

23:20.428 --> 23:22.757
quivering in the Jimmy Choos.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.187
You're gonna have to put him off.

23:25.292 --> 23:26.126
How?

23:30.017 --> 23:31.442
Completely bald!

23:31.545 --> 23:32.623
You said Brazilian!

23:32.728 --> 23:34.708
There must be bad Brazilians.

23:34.812 --> 23:37.071
Who's the one that bends the free kicks?

23:37.175 --> 23:39.780
Bald is all the rage.

23:39.884 --> 23:41.621
Brazilian's so nice.

23:41.726 --> 23:43.603
I'm not interested in fanny fashion!

23:43.706 --> 23:46.659
And it's not supposed to hurt this much, either.

23:46.763 --> 23:49.995
I suppose I should have used alcohol-free wipes.

23:50.098 --> 23:52.357
Tea tree's the best, I think.

23:52.461 --> 23:56.248
On the plus side, you could stuff a cushion with these.

24:01.529 --> 24:02.953
She giving you the old heave-ho, then?

24:03.058 --> 24:04.170
Permanent?

24:04.275 --> 24:06.567
Or is it just a lover's 'tiff?

24:06.671 --> 24:08.200
What?

24:08.304 --> 24:10.805
Your girlfriend.

24:10.910 --> 24:13.168
Well you've been spending so much time there, of late.

24:13.273 --> 24:16.191
I expected this to be a solo mission.

24:16.296 --> 24:17.094
Yeah.

24:17.199 --> 24:19.596
Take her to see Yond, hypnotist,

24:19.700 --> 24:21.229
at the Jockey tomorrow night.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.584
Laughter's a rare remedy.

24:22.688 --> 24:23.522
Yeah, maybe.

24:23.626 --> 24:25.294
Don't be a doormat.

24:25.398 --> 24:28.560
I'll talk her round.

24:28.663 --> 24:31.166
Never underestimate the wisdom of the old fella, son,

24:31.270 --> 24:33.284
when it comes to the ladies.

24:33.389 --> 24:37.453
I cast my net far and wide before I met your mother.

24:37.558 --> 24:38.392
Excellent.

24:38.496 --> 24:39.364
Shh.

24:46.590 --> 24:47.424
What's she doing?

24:49.962 --> 24:50.829
I couldn't say, Michael.

24:58.161 --> 24:59.550
I'll grab her.

24:59.654 --> 25:01.183
Sh, sh, wait.

25:22.029 --> 25:23.731
I'm fucking gorgeous.

25:23.836 --> 25:26.025
I'm in my prime, you bastard.

25:26.129 --> 25:31.027
LIAM: [clears throat] Corrie's on.

25:31.132 --> 25:32.973
Thought you might want to know.

25:33.077 --> 25:34.154
Be down in a minute.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.175
- Hiya. - Hi.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.287
It really burns when I piss.

25:47.391 --> 25:48.885
And most of the time I can't piss,

25:48.990 --> 25:50.761
so I've got this really throbbing pain.

25:50.866 --> 25:54.027
And I'm itching so much that I'm scratching myself raw.

25:54.132 --> 25:56.147
I do this job two days a week until they can get me

25:56.252 --> 25:58.232
in full-time at McDonald's, so you

25:58.336 --> 26:01.081
probably want to wait for one of the doctors to examine you.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.825
Just your name, for now.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.458
Carl Gallagher.

26:18.487 --> 26:20.537
CARL: You all right, Stan?

26:20.641 --> 26:22.377
All right, Carl.

26:22.481 --> 26:25.331
What you in for?

26:25.436 --> 26:27.624
You've got genital herpes or something.

26:27.729 --> 26:30.195
Hey, it gives you an itchy ass, huh?

26:30.299 --> 26:31.446
Read about it.

26:31.549 --> 26:32.974
No.

26:33.078 --> 26:34.434
Nothing like that.

26:34.538 --> 26:37.213
It's just a small personal.

26:37.317 --> 26:38.811
I have an infection.

26:38.916 --> 26:42.180
I've just got a small nubbin on the end of me--

26:42.285 --> 26:43.849
A bit of diplomacy, eh?

26:43.953 --> 26:46.420
About us seeing each other here?

26:46.524 --> 26:47.462
I've only got chlamydia.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.929
It's like the Stockport County of VDs.

26:50.033 --> 26:52.153
Chlamydia's very infectious, Carl.

26:52.257 --> 26:54.376
It can lead to infertility.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.087
Premature birth, whole load of most nasty things.

26:57.190 --> 26:58.303
You've got to tell them, Carl.

26:58.407 --> 27:00.282
Any girls you've been with.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.298
It's important.

27:02.402 --> 27:03.236
You all right, Tina?

27:03.340 --> 27:04.279
[groans]

27:12.443 --> 27:14.110
Not today, Micky.

27:14.214 --> 27:15.639
We're supposed to have a chat.

27:15.743 --> 27:18.106
Me and Ady had the chat, we didn't need you present.

27:18.210 --> 27:22.066
It's OK I'll handle it.

27:22.170 --> 27:24.637
Honest.

27:24.742 --> 27:26.201
Faggot.

27:26.305 --> 27:27.730
Which one us are you talking to?

27:30.404 --> 27:31.829
She gave me an ultimatum.

27:31.933 --> 27:32.767
Made me choose.

27:32.871 --> 27:35.616
What, and you chose her?

27:35.719 --> 27:38.222
You're even gayer than I am!

27:38.326 --> 27:39.994
We can still see each other.

27:40.098 --> 27:41.591
Just not when she knows.

27:47.117 --> 27:48.888
No, mate.

27:48.992 --> 27:50.695
I don't think so.

27:50.799 --> 27:51.911
Why?

27:52.015 --> 27:54.864
Because I prefer a bit more spine.

27:54.969 --> 27:56.566
You're too pussy whipped.

27:56.670 --> 27:57.504
Micky--

27:57.608 --> 27:59.207
No, mate.

27:59.310 --> 28:02.056
I deserve better.

28:02.159 --> 28:03.516
I deserve fucking better.

28:16.301 --> 28:17.517
DEBBIE: What are you doing?

28:17.621 --> 28:19.740
Going see the hypnotist at the Jockey.

28:19.844 --> 28:20.782
Not in that top, you're not.

28:20.886 --> 28:21.790
That's mine.

28:21.894 --> 28:22.763
It's stolen.

28:22.866 --> 28:23.839
It's mine.

28:23.943 --> 28:25.646
It's only a top, Debs.

28:25.750 --> 28:26.966
What about Stella?

28:27.071 --> 28:28.808
Well, Liam can look after--

28:28.912 --> 28:30.475
Don't even think about it.

28:30.580 --> 28:32.595
You can't leave a baby with a nine-year-old boy.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.950
Fine!

28:34.054 --> 28:38.363
I'll stay in again, like the prisoner of fucking Zenda!

28:38.467 --> 28:40.029
What you doing?

28:40.134 --> 28:41.142
Don't.

28:41.246 --> 28:43.851
[stella cries]

28:46.110 --> 28:46.944
Debbie!

28:51.634 --> 28:54.622
[guitar playing]

29:01.398 --> 29:03.760
Thanks a fucking bunch, Stan!

29:12.585 --> 29:14.529
[knock on door]

29:20.713 --> 29:22.104
Good evening, madam.

29:22.207 --> 29:24.257
Do you believe in the living Christ?

29:24.362 --> 29:29.226
After this week, absolutely not.

29:29.329 --> 29:32.735
Wait, my soul might be lost.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.958
My son's is definitely up for grabs.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.860
Ten.

29:44.964 --> 29:47.918
Do I look like immigrant labor?

29:51.670 --> 29:54.240
20, then, but that's for the whole night.

29:54.345 --> 29:56.533
Not changing any more nappies.

29:56.639 --> 29:59.800
Just keep them talking, all right?

29:59.905 --> 30:01.468
I'll give you some privacy.

30:01.572 --> 30:04.421
I've just got a quick point to make to me husband.

30:07.825 --> 30:08.729
Have fun!

30:14.252 --> 30:17.519
HYPNOTIST: Now, Carl is your husband,

30:17.623 --> 30:22.731
Lillian is your lesbian lover, and Norma is Brad Pitt.

30:22.834 --> 30:23.668
[crowd cheering]

30:23.773 --> 30:26.483
In the nude.

30:26.587 --> 30:27.420
[crowd cheering]

30:27.526 --> 30:29.992
And wake!

30:30.096 --> 30:30.929
Lillian!

30:31.034 --> 30:32.042
What are you doing here?

30:32.145 --> 30:35.134
Carl will find out.

30:35.238 --> 30:36.941
Oh, my god.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.573
Brad Pitt?

30:38.677 --> 30:44.133
You're everything I imagined and more!

30:44.236 --> 30:47.189
NORMA: It is not amusing to put me in this position.

30:47.293 --> 30:50.142
A penis is an impressive appendage!

30:50.246 --> 30:52.852
[crowd laughing and cheering]

30:54.034 --> 30:56.154
Marital strife and an imaginary knob.

30:56.258 --> 30:59.523
Passes for entertainment, does it?

30:59.627 --> 31:01.191
JAMIE: All right, Shane? SHANE: Yes, mate.

31:01.296 --> 31:02.233
JAMIE: All right, Kelly?

31:02.337 --> 31:04.110
Yeah, magic.

31:04.213 --> 31:10.015
[snorts] Can I have lager and a vodka tonic, please?

31:10.120 --> 31:13.559
You have-- you've got something on your--

31:13.663 --> 31:16.513
Oh, yeah, me falser.

31:16.617 --> 31:18.666
Seems to rub when it's me time of the month.

31:18.770 --> 31:21.029
And, Jesus, am I on!

31:21.133 --> 31:22.628
It's like someone's turned a tap--

31:22.732 --> 31:23.878
Hey all right, Kelly, yeah?

31:23.982 --> 31:25.962
Pint and a vodka tonic was it?

31:26.067 --> 31:27.248
What you doing?

31:27.352 --> 31:29.333
Don't worry, I've got a sitter so you can

31:29.437 --> 31:31.765
remove the gun from me head.

31:31.870 --> 31:32.876
Who?

31:32.980 --> 31:34.544
You fucking peck away at me like a hen.

31:34.649 --> 31:35.829
You know that, Debbie?

31:35.934 --> 31:37.949
Seven of you I brought up, and not of you

31:38.053 --> 31:39.548
has ever had the good grace to pay me

31:39.652 --> 31:41.562
the tiniest little compliment.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.161
When your responsibilities in life

31:43.265 --> 31:46.461
extend beyond "which sleeveless top shall I rob?" then

31:46.566 --> 31:47.955
you can question my parenting skills.

31:48.059 --> 31:48.928
All right?

31:58.413 --> 31:59.594
Two bottles of lager, Karen.

32:02.513 --> 32:05.813
[groans in pain] Sorry.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.446
Just a little bit sensitive.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.149
Must be all the excitement.

32:09.252 --> 32:10.816
Just gonna nip the loo.

32:24.296 --> 32:28.014
You might, at least, wait till the lad comes back.

32:28.118 --> 32:30.307
Only real fundamentalists still adhere to the notion

32:30.411 --> 32:33.607
that God physically created the world in seven days.

32:33.711 --> 32:34.962
It's metaphorical.

32:35.067 --> 32:37.394
Do you know what a metaphor is?

32:37.499 --> 32:39.619
Don't you it's hypocritical of the church

32:39.723 --> 32:42.606
to insist on creationism for centuries,

32:42.710 --> 32:47.575
only to jump on the intelligent design bandwagon now?

32:47.679 --> 32:50.840
[clucks like a chicken]

32:52.404 --> 32:56.816
And now you're a monkey!

32:56.920 --> 32:58.448
SHANE: You're hypnotizing her all the time!

32:58.552 --> 33:00.742
Hypnotize some locals!

33:00.846 --> 33:03.625
[crowd groans]

33:03.730 --> 33:06.891
Some people are more susceptible to hypnotism

33:06.997 --> 33:09.427
than other people, so--

33:09.532 --> 33:12.172
You're fucking at it, you are.

33:15.125 --> 33:17.870
What about this gallant young lad?

33:17.974 --> 33:19.954
MAXINE: Yeah, that's more like it!

33:20.058 --> 33:21.588
[crowd cheers]

33:21.692 --> 33:25.097
And this lovely lady.

33:25.201 --> 33:27.007
Me? HYPNOTIST: Yes.

33:27.112 --> 33:28.015
Come on, folks.

33:28.119 --> 33:30.309
Come on, give them a hand.

33:30.413 --> 33:33.956
[applause]

33:38.960 --> 33:41.564
You, little lady, are exquisite.

33:41.669 --> 33:43.684
Anybody can say the right words.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.699
Not rocket science, is it?

33:45.803 --> 33:46.672
Feel heavy.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.868
Feel heavy.

33:49.972 --> 33:51.327
Ssh!

33:51.432 --> 33:52.925
Right, mate, listen, I'll give you

33:53.030 --> 33:55.984
50 quid if you do what I say and make out you're hypnotized.

33:56.088 --> 33:57.060
What?

33:57.164 --> 33:58.659
It's a fucking scam, all right?

33:58.763 --> 34:00.396
I could no more hypnotize you than pull a bunch of flowers

34:00.500 --> 34:01.612
out me ass.

34:01.716 --> 34:04.252
50 quid, are you in our out?

34:04.356 --> 34:06.059
Yes I am.

34:06.163 --> 34:09.603
And sleep.

34:18.565 --> 34:20.721
How long you going to keep this up?

34:20.824 --> 34:23.674
I'm busy.

34:23.777 --> 34:26.592
Sorry if the text was over the top.

34:26.697 --> 34:30.969
It was just a joke, try and snap you out of it.

34:31.074 --> 34:32.533
Look, we can go for dinner, or something.

34:32.637 --> 34:33.748
Your choice.

34:33.853 --> 34:34.860
Don't know what you're talking about.

34:34.965 --> 34:35.799
What text?

34:35.902 --> 34:38.301
The filthy one.

34:38.405 --> 34:39.447
You've been blanking me so much I

34:39.551 --> 34:40.697
thought it would break the ice.

34:40.802 --> 34:41.844
I haven't been blanking ya.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.686
I've been rushed off me feet.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.228
I didn't get any text.

34:47.333 --> 34:50.286
Recognize it?

34:50.391 --> 34:51.676
No.

34:51.781 --> 34:53.900
So you're not angry with me?

34:54.005 --> 34:55.811
Jesus, Jamie you went on the tiles with a mate.

34:55.915 --> 34:57.340
You're not Osama bin Laden.

34:57.444 --> 34:58.521
So who have I sent this to?

35:02.690 --> 35:03.627
Oh, shit.

35:43.305 --> 35:45.945
But I want your baby.

35:46.050 --> 35:49.976
I want to feel your seed grow inside me.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.643
Ooh, easy tiger!

35:57.272 --> 35:58.869
HECKLER: Fucking god-awful!

35:58.975 --> 36:02.484
If evolution is right, and I'm not conceding that,

36:02.588 --> 36:04.707
then surely there's a guiding hand

36:04.810 --> 36:06.791
behind it, an intelligence.

36:06.896 --> 36:09.848
It can't be just chance.

36:09.952 --> 36:11.446
I don't accept that.

36:11.551 --> 36:14.226
When the black symbiote attaches itself to Spider-man's suit,

36:14.331 --> 36:16.206
it's because a meteor's crashing to Earth.

36:16.311 --> 36:17.978
A meteor hitting hitting the earth

36:18.082 --> 36:21.105
is pure maths, not religion.

36:21.210 --> 36:22.634
Spider-man isn't real!

36:22.737 --> 36:27.463
There's as much proof of him as there is for God.

36:27.567 --> 36:31.250
And finally, ladies and gentlemen, this young man

36:31.354 --> 36:35.627
will awake and believe he has never been hypnotized at all.

36:35.732 --> 36:38.476
You have seen the evidence yourselves.

36:38.581 --> 36:41.950
But he will believe that I offered him 50 pounds

36:42.055 --> 36:43.932
to pretend he was hypnotized

36:44.036 --> 36:46.328
[crowd heckling]

36:46.432 --> 36:50.011
and behave in the manner you have all witnessed.

36:53.381 --> 36:56.960
And wake.

37:01.302 --> 37:05.159
Tell the good people, truthfully, have you

37:05.264 --> 37:08.564
been hypnotized this evening?

37:08.668 --> 37:10.197
What, really?

37:10.301 --> 37:12.767
Yes, the truth.

37:12.872 --> 37:14.818
Nothing but the truth.

37:14.922 --> 37:18.084
Well, no, you offered me 50 quid to pretend.

37:18.189 --> 37:21.732
[crowd cheering and clapping]

37:23.712 --> 37:24.824
He's a fucking phony!

37:32.329 --> 37:34.169
Is that a wedding ring on your finger?

37:36.637 --> 37:39.555
He's not the possessive type, if that's

37:39.659 --> 37:40.771
what you're wondering.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.566
YVONNE: It's a good job.

37:45.670 --> 37:46.539
Were it painful?

37:46.643 --> 37:48.693
No, they froze it, first.

37:48.797 --> 37:51.437
I'm only just getting the feeling back.

37:51.542 --> 37:54.772
So do you see any problems for future--

37:54.877 --> 37:56.024
you know.

37:56.128 --> 37:59.254
What's sauce for the goose, Stanley.

37:59.359 --> 38:01.199
Funny, though.

38:01.304 --> 38:03.076
Seems a little lonely.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.848
Like he's lost his friend.

38:04.952 --> 38:06.516
Doesn't have to be.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.565
They gave me it in a jar, for safekeeping.

38:08.669 --> 38:09.712
As a keepsake.

38:09.815 --> 38:10.824
[yvonne gags]

38:10.928 --> 38:11.762
Yvonne?

38:11.867 --> 38:12.874
I thought I'd be funny.

38:17.564 --> 38:18.989
Can I have a word?

38:19.092 --> 38:21.455
Are you sure, Karen's just over there.

38:21.559 --> 38:24.304
Yeah, I know.

38:24.408 --> 38:26.250
You're a nice lad, Jamie.

38:26.354 --> 38:29.447
But, let's be honest, you did hit

38:29.551 --> 38:32.434
a few branches of the ugly tree on the way down.

38:32.538 --> 38:34.727
I appreciate your candor, but, the text

38:34.830 --> 38:37.542
message wasn't meant for you.

38:37.645 --> 38:42.197
Karen, Kelly, next to each other in the address book.

38:42.301 --> 38:43.725
I thought Karen was angry with me.

38:43.830 --> 38:46.019
I was trying to give her a bit of a giggle that's all.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.616
Right.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.840
And I'm guess you look like this because you're

38:49.944 --> 38:51.889
trying to put me off.

38:51.995 --> 38:54.948
Very admirable, being so loyal to our kid.

38:55.052 --> 38:57.067
Right.

38:57.171 --> 38:59.429
So I can take this boot polish off me tooth?

38:59.534 --> 39:01.410
Dunno.

39:01.514 --> 39:02.418
Kind of suits ya.

39:05.892 --> 39:09.366
[monica moaning]

39:13.223 --> 39:15.308
[grunting]

39:15.412 --> 39:16.454
Fucking hell!

39:22.116 --> 39:25.209
From the first minute I laid eyes on you.

39:25.313 --> 39:28.405
You're so-- so--

39:28.509 --> 39:30.316
Yeah?

39:30.421 --> 39:31.878
So motherly.

39:31.984 --> 39:32.991
What?

39:36.917 --> 39:39.349
So maternal.

39:39.453 --> 39:42.789
The way your breasts have fallen.

39:42.893 --> 39:48.382
The broadness of your hips, stretchmarks and your belly.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.161
It's such a turn-on to think that you've grown a baby.

39:55.747 --> 39:58.562
Are you feeding?

39:58.666 --> 40:02.592
Of course I think I could go again if you could lactate.

40:02.697 --> 40:03.982
[knock on door] HYPNOTIST'S WIFE: Damien?

40:04.085 --> 40:05.476
(WHISPERED)- Oh, fuck! HYPNOTIST'S WIFE: Damien?

40:05.580 --> 40:07.213
Oh, fuck! Shh!

40:07.317 --> 40:09.193
[knock on door]

40:09.297 --> 40:12.077
What are you doing? - In here.

40:17.984 --> 40:20.172
You fucking bastard!

40:20.277 --> 40:23.368
You promised no more milfs.

40:23.473 --> 40:26.426
To think I spend my nights clucking

40:26.530 --> 40:29.693
like a fucking chicken for you.

40:29.796 --> 40:30.630
I'm sorry.

40:30.735 --> 40:31.881
It

40:31.985 --> 40:32.958
What?

40:33.062 --> 40:35.772
She could never be with an 'airy guy.

40:35.876 --> 40:36.988
That's what she said!

40:37.092 --> 40:38.934
No I didn't, that's what she said.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.435
I was just repeating what he told Kelly.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.797
Told Kelly what?

40:43.903 --> 40:46.195
That hairy women were a turn off.

40:46.299 --> 40:47.967
Pig in a skirt, he said.

40:48.072 --> 40:49.947
Talking about Janine.

40:50.052 --> 40:51.441
New girl at Lillian's.

40:51.545 --> 40:53.248
Head of hair on it like she's caught

40:53.351 --> 40:54.568
her piercing in a socket.

40:54.672 --> 40:57.104
[laughs] Looks like the love-child of Amy

40:57.208 --> 40:59.467
Winehouse and Russell Brand.

40:59.571 --> 41:01.447
All that fucking hair!

41:01.552 --> 41:02.802
It's the biggest turn off going.

41:02.906 --> 41:05.477
About as sexy as a pig in a skirt.

41:05.581 --> 41:06.971
Oh

41:07.075 --> 41:08.500
Maybe you should concentrate on your relationship.

41:08.604 --> 41:10.724
Not exactly benchmark communication, is it?

41:10.828 --> 41:11.662
Text messages.

41:16.386 --> 41:17.602
I don't care if he makes a point,

41:17.706 --> 41:19.166
you're not supposed to ask questions.

41:19.270 --> 41:20.139
Night.

41:20.243 --> 41:23.196
Thanks a lot.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.732
It wouldn't be appropriate.

41:25.837 --> 41:29.727
They might not know it, but I'm wrong and they're right.

41:31.882 --> 41:32.924
Good lad.

41:36.989 --> 41:38.448
You spilled something on your dress.

42:03.707 --> 42:04.646
Good night?

42:08.292 --> 42:09.649
Not particularly.

42:13.574 --> 42:16.041
I do try, Monica.

42:18.924 --> 42:21.252
Best as I'm able.

42:21.356 --> 42:22.364
I know.

42:22.469 --> 42:28.304
I mean, sometimes, you know, I lash out.

42:28.409 --> 42:32.647
Get me defense in before the attack comes.

42:32.751 --> 42:39.875
I might misjudge it, on occasion.

42:45.191 --> 42:46.024
I'm sorry.

42:51.513 --> 42:52.383
I know.

43:05.688 --> 43:11.595
Whatever it is, don't let it swamp you, Mon.

43:11.699 --> 43:12.532
I won't.

43:16.076 --> 43:21.878
Frank, can you just hold me?

43:26.256 --> 43:27.090
Please?

43:50.437 --> 43:53.738
Stop poking me in the back!

43:53.842 --> 43:55.093
I'm not poking you.

43:58.047 --> 43:59.887
I've got the horn, is all.

44:10.797 --> 44:19.101
I am going to ride you till you cry, Frank Gallagher.

44:19.205 --> 44:20.039
Fair enough.

44:28.377 --> 44:29.350
[he grunts]

44:29.454 --> 44:30.809
MANDY: No, wait, get a condom.

44:30.913 --> 44:31.816
No I'm not coming.

44:31.920 --> 44:32.755
Me nipple stings.

44:38.140 --> 44:40.190
Oh! Oh!

44:40.294 --> 44:43.108
[mandy moaning]

44:45.123 --> 44:47.833
Do you think they're humping or dressing

44:47.937 --> 44:49.013
each other's wounds?

44:49.119 --> 44:49.952
Dunno.

44:52.211 --> 44:52.905
I know!

44:53.010 --> 44:54.607
I know!

44:54.712 --> 44:56.692
No I need to get off.

44:56.797 --> 45:00.897
Feels like you're scrubbing me muff with steel wool.

45:01.001 --> 45:03.746
[they laugh]

45:03.850 --> 45:05.796
Learned my lesson, though.

45:05.900 --> 45:06.942
What?

45:07.046 --> 45:09.165
Don't interfere in other people's love lives?

45:09.269 --> 45:10.938
Fuck, no.

45:11.041 --> 45:15.767
That's one of the few true pleasures left to a woman.

45:15.871 --> 45:18.442
So, what's the lesson?

45:18.546 --> 45:22.159
Buy ear-plugs when Mandy's got a bloke over.

45:22.263 --> 45:25.355
[mandy laughing]

45:33.798 --> 45:35.396
Do you want to shag?

45:35.500 --> 45:37.237
Drown out the noise.

45:37.342 --> 45:39.913
Yeah!

45:40.018 --> 45:40.921
(SHOUTING)- Oh, no!

45:41.024 --> 45:42.171
No, you're too heavy.

45:42.276 --> 45:42.971
No!

45:43.075 --> 45:44.568
Get off me!

45:50.614 --> 45:53.011
So what is it you've got to tell me in such a rush?

45:53.116 --> 45:56.068
What the fuck are you doing?

45:56.172 --> 45:57.666
Sorry.

45:57.771 --> 45:59.959
I thought-- I mean--

46:00.064 --> 46:01.071
Stop it.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.322
You should enjoy the view, while you can.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.372
What do you mean?

46:04.477 --> 46:06.074
I'm expecting.

46:06.179 --> 46:08.159
Don't worry, it's not yours.

46:08.263 --> 46:11.495
You're good, but you're not that good.

46:11.599 --> 46:14.552
I'm 12 weeks gone. More's the pity.

46:14.655 --> 46:16.184
I liked you.

46:16.288 --> 46:18.200
So what have you got to tell me?

46:18.304 --> 46:19.589
It's not important.

46:22.856 --> 46:26.434
He's a lucky bloke, you know, this baby's dad.

46:26.539 --> 46:27.372
Yeah.

46:27.476 --> 46:28.345
He is.

46:39.497 --> 46:42.069
[footsteps approaching]

46:57.182 --> 46:58.293
How are you?

47:05.659 --> 47:07.153
MARGARET (VOICEOVER: There was a young woman

47:07.257 --> 47:13.650
from Chatsworth who had dreams, ambitions, and other stuff.

47:13.754 --> 47:18.235
But she lost her good cheer and ended up here.

47:18.339 --> 47:20.702
So she could probably just do what she wants, now,

47:20.807 --> 47:25.497
and look after herself because every other bastard does.

47:25.601 --> 47:29.354
I know it don't rhyme, but, poems don't have to, do they?

47:29.458 --> 47:32.342
Not these days.

47:32.445 --> 47:35.608
[music playing]

48:13.408 --> 48:14.381
Enough?

48:14.485 --> 48:15.215
More.

48:15.319 --> 48:17.855
I'm doubling up for now on.
