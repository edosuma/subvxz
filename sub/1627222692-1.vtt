00:25.627 --> 00:27.394
Okay, roll up like a ball.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.130
- Yeah.
- This feels super comfortable.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.673
Make space for the baby.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.385
Oh, it's heavy.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.844
You wanna really remember
that the baby

01:16.878 --> 01:20.280
is coming out of your vagina
and not your face.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.583
Like, imagine you're
sitting on the toilet

01:21.616 --> 01:23.283
and you're taking a big poop.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.186
You're face is usually like...

01:26.219 --> 01:27.689
You might be
making some tension,

01:27.722 --> 01:29.489
but you're really focusing in
down on your bottom.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.158
- Mhm, yeah.
- Right?

01:31.191 --> 01:33.160
Next time you pee,
just notice what you're doing

01:33.193 --> 01:34.596
with your face.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.217
Is this my pee face?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.319
So, clue me in.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.723
Tell me a little bit
about how you're feeling.

02:01.756 --> 02:03.256
Like, how's everything going?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.826
How's it all?

02:04.859 --> 02:07.160
I think pretty good.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.529
Um.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.567
I'm hormonal.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.167
- Mhm.
- I do feel like...

02:17.705 --> 02:19.473
Do you have something to say?

02:19.507 --> 02:22.476
We... we had kind of
a Defcon 3 meltdown

02:22.510 --> 02:24.344
in Target the other day.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.313
- It was about car seats.
- Yeah.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.348
We read all this stuff online,

02:28.382 --> 02:31.485
all the safety things,
all the recommendations,

02:31.519 --> 02:33.521
and...

02:33.554 --> 02:35.757
and I had a friend say,

02:35.790 --> 02:39.326
"You know, this one's great
'cause it's the lightest one."

02:39.359 --> 02:41.261
The Chicco that goes...

02:41.294 --> 02:43.865
- Yeah.
- That's, yeah, interchangeable.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.566
- Yeah.
- But, once we get there,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.435
I saw it was also
the cheapest one,

02:48.468 --> 02:52.707
and then that made me
so uncomfortable,

02:52.740 --> 02:54.942
'cause then I didn't trust it,
and then I, like...

02:54.976 --> 02:58.445
I felt like a shitty mom
for going to buy

02:58.478 --> 03:02.482
the cheapest car seat
'cause it was the lightest one,

03:02.517 --> 03:03.985
and it was the one
that was recommended to me,

03:04.018 --> 03:06.821
but it wasn't
the highest rated one.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.388
Hm.

03:09.724 --> 03:11.859
I, like, totally lost it.

03:11.893 --> 03:13.861
We didn't wind up
with that car seat.

03:13.895 --> 03:15.763
- Okay.
- Um.

03:15.797 --> 03:17.532
And... and we've never
done this before,

03:17.565 --> 03:20.768
so we don't know what...
what the right thing to do is.

03:20.802 --> 03:22.469
We don't know
what the right way to go is.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.906
But, I mean,
I know that my tendency

03:24.939 --> 03:28.943
is to... you know,
I get anxious about this stuff,

03:28.976 --> 03:30.578
- and...
- Yeah.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.681
And then, I try
to mitigate my anxiousness

03:33.715 --> 03:36.851
- with control, and...
- And when he gets,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.686
like, high tense
and controlling about stuff,

03:38.720 --> 03:41.321
then I start
to just take care of him,

03:41.354 --> 03:43.758
and I totally throw myself
out the window...

03:43.791 --> 03:45.893
Right, she's trying
to take care of me,

03:45.927 --> 03:49.731
and controlling the situation,
which... which pisses me off,

03:49.764 --> 03:52.332
because we just keep
triggering each other, and...

03:52.365 --> 03:53.968
Like, we've always,
you know, kinda sometimes

03:54.001 --> 03:55.803
we just get into
a cycle of, like,

03:55.837 --> 03:58.371
- Caretaking, controlling...
- Caretaking, controlling.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.007
But, I would say it's like

04:00.041 --> 04:03.276
- mm, mm, mm, because of that.
- It's on steroids.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.312
So, why don't you just
take a deep breath?

04:05.345 --> 04:06.781
Okay.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.520
Now, close your eyes
for a second,

04:12.553 --> 04:15.288
both of you,

04:15.322 --> 04:17.925
and I want you
to think about is,

04:17.959 --> 04:20.060
what do you need most
from each other

04:20.094 --> 04:22.964
to get through the rest
of this pregnancy?

04:22.997 --> 04:26.834
And how can you
best show up for each other

04:26.868 --> 04:30.303
and make sure that
those needs get met?

04:53.928 --> 04:55.428
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.532
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.033
Okay.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.338
Oh, don't forget, oxytocin.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.375
At least one orgasm a day, okay?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.645
One orgasm every day.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.879
- Just one.
- For both of us?

05:11.913 --> 05:14.381
- More her, you...
- It's my oxytocin.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.050
- It's hers.
- It's my oxytocin, too.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.585
- One.
- Bye.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.419
Bye.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.434
- These kinda go together.
- I like this one.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.770
His and her?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.138
These are for us to wear, right?

05:37.171 --> 05:38.806
Yeah.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.750
You don't have to watch us open,

05:49.784 --> 05:52.854
especially if you got us
a shitty gift,

05:52.887 --> 05:54.789
but if you want to,

05:54.822 --> 05:57.058
we're gonna be determining
which ones of you

05:57.091 --> 05:59.560
are our close friends,
and which ones of you

05:59.594 --> 06:01.596
are expendable, so.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.731
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.638
- Oh, my God, it's the Chicco!
- Oh, man.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.808
- That's cool.
- Oh, my God, it's a car seat.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.077
It's a good one, it's light,
it's not too heavy,

06:16.110 --> 06:17.912
so you can pop it out,
and I'll teach you

06:17.945 --> 06:20.014
a little trick for how to,
like, loop your arm under,

06:20.047 --> 06:22.482
- and it makes it easier to...
- It's a huge gift.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.086
- Kids do well with it, and...
- So, yeah, and the breastfeed,

06:25.119 --> 06:28.556
it, like, really hurts
for a long time.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.092
Oh, my gosh, she talked about
the latch-on like it was so hard

06:31.125 --> 06:32.593
for new Rudi be able
to latch on,

06:32.627 --> 06:34.061
and she just, like,
"Near, near near,"

06:34.095 --> 06:36.429
like a little gremlin,
just biting and trying to,

06:36.463 --> 06:40.433
like, suck you dry
of every little ounce of life

06:40.467 --> 06:42.069
- in your soul.
- The only part of it

06:42.103 --> 06:44.005
that is cute is, like,
your friend who, like,

06:44.038 --> 06:47.440
posts a beautiful photo of her
breastfeeding on social media.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.045
It's like, "Uh-huh, okay."

06:51.078 --> 06:52.947
- Nature at its best.
- I've got, like, the cracked,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.682
bleeding nipples,
and you're just like,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.117
"Fuck you."

06:56.150 --> 06:58.185
It's cute, it's cute.

06:58.219 --> 07:00.453
Well, that's the thing,
and I feel like women,

07:00.487 --> 07:02.890
and correct me if I'm...
if I'm speaking out of turn,

07:02.924 --> 07:06.560
but I feel like women
do other women a real disservice

07:06.594 --> 07:08.495
when they talk about
their birth experience,

07:08.529 --> 07:10.564
like, "Oh, my God,
it was so wonderful."

07:10.598 --> 07:13.668
I think that that's
a really messed up thing to do

07:13.701 --> 07:15.636
to somebody who's about to
go into childbirth,

07:15.670 --> 07:18.606
'cause you should prepared
that it's gonna be

07:18.639 --> 07:21.742
the worst thing ever.

07:21.776 --> 07:26.247
It is, sometimes it just tears
all the way down.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.082
But, that's just the beginning,

07:28.115 --> 07:30.651
and that's gonna be, like,
one to two days tops of...

07:30.685 --> 07:33.888
of your life,
and then it really... begins

07:33.921 --> 07:36.524
- to like...
- Do you guys have a method

07:36.557 --> 07:39.160
- that, like, you're in?
- Your, um, parenting method.

07:39.193 --> 07:42.697
So, we've been doing, um...
been doing these RIE classes.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.099
- Uh-oh.
- Which are pretty cool.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.001
- Yeah.
- Read the Janet Lansbury books,

07:47.034 --> 07:49.170
- which are fantastic.
- And Babywise.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.738
- Babywise.
- To get around

07:50.771 --> 07:52.773
our sleep schedules,
so like, we know when

07:52.807 --> 07:54.809
her cry phase will be, and...

07:54.842 --> 07:57.011
I think picking and choosing

07:57.044 --> 07:59.046
different pieces
from different books

07:59.080 --> 08:01.649
is totally fine, that's great.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.850
But, you have to decide, like,

08:02.883 --> 08:04.151
"Are we gonna have
a family bed?"

08:04.185 --> 08:06.153
Like, is she gonna
sleep with you guys.

08:06.187 --> 08:07.888
- That's what we did.
- We did not do that.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.791
We had her sleeping with us
until she was, like, 5?

08:10.825 --> 08:12.693
- Yeah, about 5 years old.
- Were you guys just

08:12.727 --> 08:14.095
afraid of, like, crib death,
is that why you...?

08:14.128 --> 08:15.663
- Yeah, that was...
- Well, that was one of

08:15.696 --> 08:17.565
the big things, of course,
it's crib death.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.100
We wanted to
keep her close to us.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.602
But, I mean, she is a girl,
so I mean,

08:21.635 --> 08:24.138
it's not that high crib deaths
for... for girls baby...

08:24.171 --> 08:26.741
You keep saying "crib death"
like that's a thing to...

08:26.774 --> 08:28.209
- It's... it's a thing.
- Well, yeah, it is.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.613
It's... for a while it's hell,
so just be prepared

08:32.645 --> 08:34.248
- that it's gonna be...
- You don't get a lot of sleep

08:34.280 --> 08:36.049
- at all.
- As soon as they're born,

08:36.082 --> 08:38.052
you will no longer do anything
that you enjoy, because...

08:38.085 --> 08:40.154
Your baby dictates
who you will become.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.256
You don't get to
be yourselves anymore,

08:42.289 --> 08:44.759
'cause you're so tired,
and so focused

08:44.792 --> 08:47.695
on making sure that you're not
ruining this kid's life,

08:47.728 --> 08:49.330
and you're trying to make sure
that you're doing it

08:49.363 --> 08:51.132
in a healthy way,
in a productive way,

08:51.165 --> 08:52.666
in a happy way.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.068
You're not gonna repeat
your parents' mistakes,

08:54.101 --> 08:55.669
you're not gonna
do the wrong things,

08:55.703 --> 08:57.304
- and you do.
- Yep.

08:57.338 --> 09:00.141
- You just do.
- Watching my parents

09:00.174 --> 09:02.143
deteriorate in front
of my eyes as a child,

09:02.176 --> 09:04.945
and not really understand
what it was,

09:04.979 --> 09:07.014
I feel like you can
see them shrinking from

09:07.048 --> 09:08.816
- who they wanted to be.
- You're basically

09:08.849 --> 09:10.351
- getting thrown into war.
- You don't have time

09:10.384 --> 09:11.886
for yourself, you just don't,
like...

09:11.919 --> 09:13.754
My mother didn't wanna
become her mother.

09:13.788 --> 09:15.322
Her mother didn't wanna
become her mother.

09:15.356 --> 09:18.759
- My sister didn't wanna become...
- And you see it, you know it,

09:18.793 --> 09:20.194
you hate it,

09:20.227 --> 09:22.329
- but you can't stop...
- My dad had his money in order,

09:22.363 --> 09:24.065
had, you know,
a record collection,

09:24.098 --> 09:25.332
all this cool stuff.

09:25.366 --> 09:27.068
He had a car
that he really liked,

09:27.101 --> 09:29.603
he cared about his fucking car,
and then at a certain point,

09:29.637 --> 09:31.238
everything was annihilated.

09:31.272 --> 09:33.340
I saw that happen, I saw a man

09:33.374 --> 09:36.377
deteriorate in front of my eyes
as a teenager.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.012
I... it was a nightmare.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.014
I can't... I couldn't do it.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.217
But, you guys
are gonna kill it, I...

09:46.954 --> 09:48.289
Yeah.

09:48.322 --> 09:51.025
Babe, babe, can you...

09:51.058 --> 09:52.960
can you please tell me what's...?

09:52.993 --> 09:55.196
Jackie.

09:55.229 --> 09:57.832
Can you... can you just stop
for a second?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.669
Babe,

10:01.702 --> 10:04.638
can you look at me
and talk to me, please?

10:08.042 --> 10:10.811
Babe.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.185
What the fuck is this?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.222
Hummus.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.930
Did you not see this one?

10:29.964 --> 10:31.799
- I...
- I got this one two days ago.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.200
- I didn't... I didn't see that.
- It's huge.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.102
Okay, I didn't see that,
but I don't think

10:35.136 --> 10:38.072
- it's a big deal, can we not...?
- Now, we're just never gonna

10:38.105 --> 10:40.007
get through both of these
before they go bad.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.443
- Oh, okay, but...
- This one's huge.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.145
I... I didn't see it,
I didn't look.

10:44.178 --> 10:46.280
I was also... you gave me
the list with the bok choy

10:46.313 --> 10:47.815
- and the tamarind.
- Yeah, I gave you a list.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.717
I was just trying
to do a nice thing.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.952
I'm just asking you
to do an aware thing.

10:51.986 --> 10:54.722
Look, we've...
we've already eaten some.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.690
Look, there's already
that much out...

10:56.724 --> 10:59.260
You're making that up,
you're, like, making that up

10:59.293 --> 11:00.761
- to make your argument stronger.
- Okay.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.164
The seal is still on it.

11:03.197 --> 11:05.366
Okay, okay,
so the seal's still on it,

11:05.399 --> 11:07.434
- but... but the way they pack...
- Why would you lie to me

11:07.468 --> 11:08.869
and be like,
"We already ate some"?

11:08.903 --> 11:10.371
I mean, look,
it's not that full.

11:10.404 --> 11:11.839
- It's like a potato chip...
- You actually think we're gonna

11:11.872 --> 11:14.175
eat all of this
before this one...

11:14.208 --> 11:15.943
- Yes!
- ...goes bad?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.913
- We eat a lot of hummus.
- We would never eat this much.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.314
- We've definitely eaten...
- When?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.149
- When? When?
- two things of hummus in a week.

11:22.183 --> 11:24.818
Okay, this is not... do you hear
yourself talking right now?

11:24.852 --> 11:27.154
Do you hear yourself talking?
You're, like, making shit up

11:27.188 --> 11:29.857
- about the stuff we do!
- Would you fucking stop?

11:32.126 --> 11:33.961
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.329
Would you just stop?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.031
Because you're getting
really stressed out,

11:37.064 --> 11:39.266
and the OB said
you can't get stressed out.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.369
Babe, please don't cry.

11:42.403 --> 11:44.238
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.073
Look, this was all my fault.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.908
I should've absolutely seen

11:47.942 --> 11:49.511
that you bought hummus
two days ago.

11:49.544 --> 11:52.012
I was trying to do a nice thing,
but you're right, it was stupid.

11:52.046 --> 11:53.781
It wasn't a nice thing.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.382
It was a stupid
and oblivious thing,

11:55.416 --> 11:58.819
and, hey, stop, stop,
please, please, please?

11:58.852 --> 12:01.021
Babe,

12:01.055 --> 12:03.023
I'm really sorry.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.361
Hey.

12:13.367 --> 12:14.935
Ew.

12:14.969 --> 12:18.372
Why did you just
put your hand in it?

12:18.405 --> 12:21.543
If having too much hummus
is an issue,

12:21.576 --> 12:25.379
then I'm gonna
take care of the issue.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.381
Whether it makes sense
to me or not.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.184
It looks...
you're not enjoying it.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.954
This is the best hummus
I've ever had.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.091
I love this hummus so much.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.560
Oh, my gosh, I mean...

12:38.593 --> 12:40.928
- Ugh, the smell.
- This is fun.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.196
The smell, please stop.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.931
Please stop putting it
in your mouth,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.399
- stop putting it in your mouth.
- And I'm gonna eat that one

12:45.432 --> 12:47.468
- after I'm done with this.
- No.

12:47.502 --> 12:48.936
- No.
- And we're not gonna

12:48.969 --> 12:50.471
have enough, are we?
And we're gonna have to

12:50.505 --> 12:52.339
go shopping for more hummus
later on this afternoon.

12:52.373 --> 12:54.542
- Don't you fucking dare.
- 'Cause I'm gonna be

12:54.576 --> 12:56.844
a hummus-eating machine.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.379
Don't put it in your mouth,
it's so...

12:58.412 --> 13:00.247
Ugh!

13:01.616 --> 13:03.917
Oh, God, sorry, that's so gross.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.253
- I just wanna establish that...
- Oh, God.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.526
In this case, your concern

13:11.559 --> 13:14.962
about our... our hummus overage,

13:14.995 --> 13:17.131
um,
might've just been rectified,

13:17.164 --> 13:18.999
'cause look, look,
that one's half gone.

13:19.033 --> 13:21.001
- It's half gone.
- And here's a vow

13:21.035 --> 13:23.871
that I make to you:

13:23.904 --> 13:28.008
I will never, ever, ever

13:28.042 --> 13:29.943
buy too much hummus again.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.912
- Never.
- Never.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.616
I really appreciate that.

13:39.053 --> 13:41.455
There are gonna be times when
I probably want more hummus.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.124
If you ask me to buy you hummus,
I'll go out and buy you hummus

13:44.158 --> 13:46.293
that minute.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.564
Hm?

13:56.270 --> 13:57.871
- Oh, God.
- Mm.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.239
- It's smelling.
- Mm.

13:59.273 --> 14:00.974
- It's smelling.
- Mm.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.644
- Mm.
- Mm.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.214
What are you doing?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.850
Maya said, "Once a day."

14:11.452 --> 14:13.053
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

14:13.087 --> 14:14.288
- What?
- Do you still have

14:14.321 --> 14:16.056
hummus in your mouth?

14:16.090 --> 14:17.891
- No, I swallowed the hummus.
- I think there's probably

14:17.925 --> 14:20.160
- still some there.
- No, I think I...

14:20.194 --> 14:21.962
- Yeah, but...
- I think I swallowed it.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.566
I can smell it still, so.

14:24.599 --> 14:26.300
What if you...?
No, it's so...

14:26.333 --> 14:28.603
I'm super turned on,
but if you, like,

14:28.636 --> 14:31.506
maybe just
brush your teeth, or...?

14:31.539 --> 14:33.140
- 'Cause of bacteria.
- Okay.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.075
I could go for it, but it...
it's the bacteria

14:35.109 --> 14:37.044
- and the baby.
- Okay, yeah.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.613
I'll go brush my teeth.

14:38.646 --> 14:41.516
And then, I'm gonna be...

14:41.549 --> 14:44.084
I'll meet you upstairs.

14:44.118 --> 14:45.653
Thank you.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.334
You're right,
it was the whole day.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.202
It was the whole day.

15:02.236 --> 15:04.606
- I know.
- Our friends...

15:04.639 --> 15:07.174
- suck.
- I know, our friends suck.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.644
They were so discouraging.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.214
It's still a little...
I still smell it.

15:14.248 --> 15:17.017
- You're such a dick.
- I'm a super smeller.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.454
Who brings up crib death

15:20.487 --> 15:22.222
at our baby shower?

15:22.256 --> 15:24.191
Mhm, I know.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.194
- Who does that?
- I know.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.030
They said my vagina

15:30.063 --> 15:33.467
is gonna rip down.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.603
To your asshole.

15:35.637 --> 15:37.304
I don't mean to laugh,
because I know

15:37.337 --> 15:39.206
- that would really suck.
- Apparently it happens

15:39.239 --> 15:41.108
- all the time.
- I am just laughing

15:41.141 --> 15:44.111
at the severe insensitivity
of our asshole friends

15:44.144 --> 15:45.979
that they would bring it up
at our fucking baby shower.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.283
I truly don't think
they want us to be parents.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.119
What, you think they want us
to have an abortion?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.221
Third-term abortion.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.623
I do.

15:55.657 --> 15:57.057
- Oh, that's so dark.
- I do, I think they were trying

15:57.090 --> 15:58.358
- to convince us...
- That's so dark

15:58.392 --> 16:00.294
to go into the OB, be like,

16:00.327 --> 16:03.197
"Um, here's the thing:
we know we were

16:03.230 --> 16:05.767
- really excited...
- "We were, we were excited."

16:05.800 --> 16:08.001
...about having this kid, but..."

16:08.035 --> 16:10.270
"But, we had a...
we had a baby shower."

16:10.304 --> 16:12.740
"And our friends
really fucked us up,

16:12.774 --> 16:15.710
and now we're wondering
if you could

16:15.743 --> 16:18.513
take her out, and just, like,

16:18.546 --> 16:20.113
- get rid of her."
- You need to kiss her

16:20.147 --> 16:22.684
after this joke,
this joke is too bad.

16:22.717 --> 16:25.052
- Baby, it's really dark and...
- Baby.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.422
Dark, bad jokes
for a dark, bad baby shower.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.059
But, they were so serious

16:32.092 --> 16:36.029
about... turning out
like their parents.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.098
I know, but you know what?

16:38.131 --> 16:39.534
And it's true.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.803
- But, you know what?
- They have.

16:41.836 --> 16:45.339
But, in fairness, B's always
been a living nightmare, and...

16:45.372 --> 16:47.407
But now,
she's exactly like her mom.

16:47.441 --> 16:50.477
Hey, babe, it's okay.

16:50.512 --> 16:53.080
- You know why?
- Why?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.783
'Cause we're cooler
than they are.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.755
Come on, take your pants off,
come to bed.

17:02.590 --> 17:05.425
Fuck.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.227
Honey,

17:07.261 --> 17:09.763
I have to tell you something
before I take my pants off.

17:09.797 --> 17:12.098
No, take your pants off,
then you can tell me something.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.300
- That's so bad.
- No, can you just

17:14.334 --> 17:16.570
take your pants off first,
and then you can

17:16.604 --> 17:18.405
tell me something
if you have to?

17:20.675 --> 17:23.443
Take your pants off.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.413
I got a text from my dad
at the baby shower.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.419
I'm so sorry.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.321
Ugh.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.823
- No.
- He said he was gonna

17:35.857 --> 17:37.457
be evicted.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.127
No.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.596
Um, I know.

17:43.698 --> 17:46.534
- I know, honey, I know...
- How much did you send him?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.772
2,000.

17:52.507 --> 17:54.842
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.882
Woo.

18:00.915 --> 18:04.384
Babe, your dad is always
about to be evicted,

18:04.418 --> 18:06.688
because your dad
is a fucking drug addict

18:06.721 --> 18:08.856
who spends
all his money on oxys.

18:08.890 --> 18:10.525
You swore.

18:10.558 --> 18:12.326
- You swore to God...
- I know, I did.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.461
...the last four times,
not just, like,

18:14.494 --> 18:15.830
the last time it happened.

18:15.863 --> 18:18.600
The last four times it happened
you swore to me

18:18.633 --> 18:19.867
- that you'd never do it again.
- I did.

18:19.901 --> 18:21.603
- You swore to your sponsor.
- I did.

18:21.636 --> 18:23.638
You swore to our therapist.

18:23.671 --> 18:25.205
- I did.
- We sat down

18:25.238 --> 18:26.874
and we had this discussion,
and you said,

18:26.908 --> 18:28.643
- "I'm never gonna do it again."
- I know.

18:28.676 --> 18:31.546
That's the fucking kid's money
that you just gave him.

18:31.579 --> 18:33.548
You are so, so right,

18:33.581 --> 18:36.383
and I know you're so, so right.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.352
Can you... can you not
turn this into, like,

18:38.385 --> 18:41.388
"You're so right,"
self-flagellation stuff?

18:41.421 --> 18:44.759
Can you just let me be
really pissed for a second?

18:44.792 --> 18:47.294
Yes.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.931
Thank you.

18:49.964 --> 18:53.233
Okay, that's all I needed.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.337
- Oh, man.
- It's not fair.

18:57.371 --> 19:00.240
- That's a bummer.
- It's such a bummer.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.744
It was just habit,
but I know I...

19:02.777 --> 19:05.345
I can't, I gotta change.

19:05.379 --> 19:08.716
Well, we both have...
look, I just...

19:08.750 --> 19:11.485
I just... my first reaction
when I was upset

19:11.519 --> 19:13.487
- was to, like, do that.
- It's very scary.

19:13.521 --> 19:15.455
And... and I don't...

19:15.489 --> 19:18.926
I mean, how many
fucking hundreds of hours

19:18.960 --> 19:20.561
in therapy have I spent

19:20.595 --> 19:22.396
trying to work through
my rage issues.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.599
- There's still...
- A hole.

19:24.632 --> 19:26.834
The hole in the sheetrock

19:26.868 --> 19:29.904
from... from, like,
a month and a half ago,

19:29.937 --> 19:31.506
and that's insane.

19:31.539 --> 19:34.207
It's like,

19:34.241 --> 19:37.477
if we don't
pull our shit together,

19:37.512 --> 19:39.714
- she's gonna...
- We're gonna fuck up our kid.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.483
Mm.

19:43.518 --> 19:45.653
Like, we signed up
for each other's madness.

19:45.687 --> 19:48.656
- I know.
- She didn't sign up for it.

19:48.690 --> 19:51.391
I know, it makes me
really sad actually.

19:51.425 --> 19:54.862
The therapy has made us aware.

19:54.896 --> 19:57.364
- Mhm.
- But, clearly...

19:57.397 --> 19:59.466
Hasn't actually changed

19:59.499 --> 20:02.335
our behavior enough.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.640
It's like we need to,
like, shake ourselves,

20:05.673 --> 20:08.710
'cause we gotta pull it together
before we're parents.

20:08.743 --> 20:11.846
And I'm scared, too,
because we've got

20:11.879 --> 20:14.782
- a month.
- What if we shake it up?

20:14.816 --> 20:16.617
What if we challenge each other?

20:16.651 --> 20:18.553
What if we challenge
each other to, like,

20:18.586 --> 20:20.655
activities and tasks?
Like, we have a month...

20:20.688 --> 20:22.857
- I like this.
- ...before this baby is coming.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.458
- That is time.
- We got...

20:24.491 --> 20:25.760
- We got four weeks...
- It's a short amount.

20:25.793 --> 20:29.429
to become fully realized humans.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.537
To be parents.

20:36.571 --> 20:38.740
- Okay, so we got four weeks.
- Let's do something.

20:38.773 --> 20:40.407
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Let's do it, let's change.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.809
Let's do it.

20:41.843 --> 20:43.745
- What are we gonna do?
- More... let's, like...

20:43.778 --> 20:45.345
Let's jump out of an airplane.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.582
- Dine and dash.
- Dine and dash, I'm in.

20:47.615 --> 20:49.349
- I'm in, let's do it.
- I mean, just to get ourselves,

20:49.382 --> 20:51.284
- like, uncomfortable...
- Okay.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.721
...and, like...
and see what we're made of.

20:53.755 --> 20:55.623
We could, uh...

20:55.656 --> 20:58.860
we could buy a classic car
and drive it up the coast.

20:58.893 --> 21:00.762
Like, we go to Antarctica.

21:00.795 --> 21:03.598
Great, we dive under an icecap,

21:03.631 --> 21:06.333
and swim around,
and we come up, and woo!

21:06.366 --> 21:08.703
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

21:08.736 --> 21:10.738
We could jump off a cliff
into the ocean.

21:10.772 --> 21:13.841
- Um, we could swim with sharks.
- We could graffiti something.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.510
Uh, we could get tattoos.

21:15.543 --> 21:17.779
- Let's, um...
- Go to a punk-rock show.

21:17.812 --> 21:20.380
- Mosh pit.
- We buy a falcon.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.683
- I would love a falcon.
- Oh, yeah.

21:22.717 --> 21:24.852
- Sitting on the porch.
- Um.

21:24.886 --> 21:27.320
We could...
let's get chased by the cops.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.890
We could do anything honestly.

21:28.923 --> 21:30.625
We could... but we could both take

21:30.658 --> 21:32.425
- pole dancing classes.
- I could fuck you in the ass.

21:34.061 --> 21:35.863
That's funny.

21:38.733 --> 21:40.701
- Yeah, no.
- Okay, what else could we do?

21:40.735 --> 21:42.402
- No, but, honey.
- What?

21:42.435 --> 21:44.471
- Actually that one...
- Oh, we're not playing a game,

21:44.505 --> 21:46.373
- you're serious now.
- All the other ones

21:46.406 --> 21:48.075
it's super fun to think of,
but we actually

21:48.109 --> 21:50.578
can't travel right now,
'cause of the baby,

21:50.611 --> 21:52.880
and we can't put her
in dangerous situations.

21:52.914 --> 21:55.448
Like... like, it's fun to think
about jumping out of a plane,

21:55.482 --> 21:56.818
but I'm never gonna
do that with a baby,

21:56.851 --> 21:59.654
but... but what about

21:59.687 --> 22:02.089
pegging?

22:02.123 --> 22:04.692
- Because that's...
- I... I... I...

22:04.725 --> 22:06.127
- ...intimate.
- I just got...

22:06.160 --> 22:08.495
It is intimate,
I don't see how it really

22:08.529 --> 22:10.631
prepares us
to become better parents

22:10.665 --> 22:12.033
- in a month.
- No, but it... it makes us

22:12.066 --> 22:13.534
- deal with stuff.
- Ugh.

22:13.568 --> 22:16.537
It's an act... it's so actionable.

22:16.571 --> 22:18.639
Yeah, no,
it's definitely actionable.

22:18.673 --> 22:20.440
I read this article
and it's like it's supposed

22:20.473 --> 22:22.510
- to be so empowering.
- Mhm.

22:22.543 --> 22:25.546
And it... and honestly,
it really deals with our issues

22:25.580 --> 22:26.948
in a way where...
'cause I'm always being

22:26.981 --> 22:28.783
a caretaker,
and I'm always, like...

22:28.816 --> 22:31.484
Like, when we have sex,
I receive you and I hold you,

22:31.519 --> 22:32.820
and I'm always going

22:32.854 --> 22:34.555
- with your rhythm.
- I wait until you come

22:34.589 --> 22:36.057
- until I come every single time.
- Which is... which is awesome.

22:36.090 --> 22:37.792
No, you are
a very generous lover,

22:37.825 --> 22:39.694
you're very good, but it is
like a waiting for you...

22:39.727 --> 22:41.762
it is... there is, like, um...

22:41.796 --> 22:43.831
you're in control,

22:43.865 --> 22:46.167
and what if
you weren't in control?

22:46.200 --> 22:49.136
Hm?

22:49.170 --> 22:52.607
I mean, it would be so...
remember what Maya said?

22:52.640 --> 22:55.475
Yeah, when... when we were
humming the song back then,

22:55.509 --> 22:58.478
I didn't think it was leading
to fucking me in the ass.

23:00.648 --> 23:02.516
- Honey.
- Uh-huh?

23:05.485 --> 23:08.556
I feel like I need this.

23:30.511 --> 23:32.013
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:32.046 --> 23:34.649
Hi.

23:34.682 --> 23:38.019
So, this is our sweet spot.

23:38.052 --> 23:40.955
First time, it's so exciting.

23:40.988 --> 23:43.224
I remember my first time
like it was,

23:43.257 --> 23:44.892
uh, 10 years ago.

23:46.594 --> 23:48.863
Uh, I guess it kinda depends
on who this is for.

23:48.896 --> 23:52.033
I mean, obviously it's
for both of you, right?

23:52.066 --> 23:55.468
Yeah, more for her
in this case than for me,

23:55.503 --> 23:58.239
- but yeah.
- I think for you...

23:58.272 --> 23:59.807
- Mhm.
- ...you might like something

23:59.840 --> 24:01.742
- with vibration because...
- Nah.

24:01.776 --> 24:05.046
...you'll also have a bit
of clitoral stimulation during.

24:05.079 --> 24:07.615
- Ooh.
- So, that could be really nice.

24:07.648 --> 24:10.483
I think... I think we don't
need to do vibration.

24:10.518 --> 24:12.553
Let's just...
let's skip the vibration.

24:12.586 --> 24:14.622
Let's skip
any bells and whistles,

24:14.655 --> 24:16.691
and really
what we're looking for

24:16.724 --> 24:19.260
is just kinda the VW Bug

24:19.293 --> 24:21.729
of strap-ons.

24:21.762 --> 24:23.831
We do have
a beginner strap-on actually.

24:23.864 --> 24:26.033
Oh, that is, that says,
"Beginner strap-on" right there,

24:26.067 --> 24:28.569
- "For him."
- It's 4-and-a-half inches.

24:28.602 --> 24:30.871
- Okay.
- So, I think plus belly...

24:30.905 --> 24:33.240
I was gonna say, if...
do we need, like...

24:33.274 --> 24:35.142
I think you're gonna
want more length, personally.

24:35.176 --> 24:37.211
Personally, I would say
you're gonna want more length

24:37.244 --> 24:39.246
given belly and.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.950
Okay, I would suggest
going modular.

24:42.984 --> 24:44.885
We've got
a couple harness options.

24:44.919 --> 24:46.954
This is our most popular,
this is my favorite.

24:46.988 --> 24:48.889
- I have this one actually.
- Oh, you have this one?

24:48.923 --> 24:50.591
Yeah, this one's
really, really great.

24:50.624 --> 24:53.794
Super well priced,
really easy to use.

24:53.828 --> 24:55.563
Um, not super intimidating.

24:55.596 --> 24:58.833
Can you just tell me, what...
what are these?

24:58.866 --> 25:02.136
This is, um, if you want
a dick on your dick.

25:02.169 --> 25:03.771
Uh, oh, that's just if...

25:03.804 --> 25:05.272
- Length.
- ...you have a small dick

25:05.306 --> 25:06.974
- and you want a bigger dick?
- You don't necessarily

25:07.008 --> 25:08.976
have to have a small dick,
it's for any size dick,

25:09.010 --> 25:11.312
but if you want more length.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.848
So, I... I would go here.

25:13.881 --> 25:15.549
It's a really good color.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.752
- If it's your favorite.
- Yeah, I would go here.

25:17.785 --> 25:19.887
- And then...
- Can I just ask,

25:19.920 --> 25:22.990
um, is something that you use
with your current partner?

25:23.024 --> 25:25.826
It is something I have used
with past partners, yes.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.562
Um, and without
getting too personal...

25:28.596 --> 25:30.131
I guess as a general question,
'cause I think

25:30.164 --> 25:32.566
what he's getting at is,
a lot of straight couples

25:32.600 --> 25:34.668
- use this, right?
- Definitely.

25:34.702 --> 25:36.237
- That's what I was asking.
- Definitely, plenty of

25:36.270 --> 25:40.307
- straight couples use these.
- But, is your partner a...?

25:43.244 --> 25:45.279
So, I would say

25:45.312 --> 25:47.882
this would be
a great place to go

25:47.915 --> 25:49.817
if you wanna
go for something modular,

25:49.850 --> 25:53.254
where you can purchase
a harness and also a dildo.

25:53.287 --> 25:55.089
And are these the only
two options for dildos?

25:55.122 --> 25:57.358
No, we have a plethora
of options.

25:57.391 --> 25:59.360
Uh, would you like to see them?

25:59.393 --> 26:01.729
- Okay, there we go.
- Good.

26:01.762 --> 26:03.998
- And that'll be all?
- And some of this.

26:04.031 --> 26:06.700
- Plus lube, okay.
- I got this one.

26:06.734 --> 26:08.235
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

26:37.798 --> 26:39.700
All right, come here,
I love you.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.268
I just want you to know

26:41.302 --> 26:44.038
your mama's dick
is bigger than mine is,

26:44.071 --> 26:46.073
and, um, I'm okay with that,

26:46.107 --> 26:49.743
because I am
a modern, evolved man

26:49.777 --> 26:51.979
- in a modern, evolved world.
- Mhm.

26:52.012 --> 26:55.316
And, um, that doesn't make me
feel insecure at all.

26:55.349 --> 26:57.718
- Okay, okay.
- Mhm.

26:57.751 --> 26:59.420
Okay, okay.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.256
- I like this angle.
- Thanks.

27:02.289 --> 27:05.025
I'm gonna need your butt
a little higher.

27:05.059 --> 27:06.760
- Okay.
- Like, put a little arch

27:06.794 --> 27:08.996
in your back, a little cat cow.

27:09.029 --> 27:10.664
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

27:10.698 --> 27:13.167
Just... I know
what you're feeling.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.069
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- I've been there.

27:15.102 --> 27:18.272
Just put the weight
on the elbows.

27:18.305 --> 27:20.141
- Okay.
- And let yourself

27:20.174 --> 27:22.710
rock forward.

27:22.743 --> 27:24.445
It's better, right?

27:24.478 --> 27:26.881
You're gonna feel

27:26.914 --> 27:28.415
- a little something...
- Okay!

27:28.449 --> 27:32.219
Um, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:32.253 --> 27:34.221
- I didn't even put it in.
- I know.

27:34.255 --> 27:36.790
If I say, "Stop,"
you stop immediately.

27:36.824 --> 27:38.425
- Immediately.
- Safe word:

27:38.459 --> 27:40.861
"Immediately."

27:40.895 --> 27:43.130
"Immediately" is our safe word?

27:43.164 --> 27:46.133
No, "stop" is our safe word,
I'm just... I was just trying

27:46.167 --> 27:48.702
to reiterate
that if I say, "Stop,"

27:48.736 --> 27:50.704
that you immediately stop.

27:50.738 --> 27:53.140
Yes, and maybe,

27:53.174 --> 27:55.843
just throwing out there,
we pause,

27:55.876 --> 27:58.078
as opposed to, like,
pull everything apart.

27:58.112 --> 28:00.714
Okay, except if I tell you
to pull it out, you pull it out.

28:00.748 --> 28:01.916
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:01.949 --> 28:03.951
- Yeah.
- Okay, I just, you know,

28:03.984 --> 28:06.220
- I would do the same for you.
- You would?

28:06.253 --> 28:09.190
- Yeah.
- All right.

28:09.223 --> 28:12.893
- Just breathe.
- Okay, huh!

28:12.927 --> 28:15.863
- Huh!
- It's a familiar.

28:15.896 --> 28:18.432
- It's me.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

28:18.465 --> 28:20.467
Breathe.

28:20.501 --> 28:22.970
It's okay, are you okay?

28:23.003 --> 28:24.338
- Mhm.
- Okay, I want you to...

28:24.371 --> 28:26.974
I want you to enjoy it,
and if you don't, it's...

28:27.007 --> 28:29.977
we're just gonna pause.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.979
Just let me breathe, just stop
right there and let me breathe.

28:32.012 --> 28:33.480
Uh-huh.

28:36.116 --> 28:37.785
You're doing so good.

28:37.818 --> 28:40.154
- You're doing so good, baby.
- Okay.

28:40.187 --> 28:43.290
I'm just gonna...
your back is all sweaty.

28:43.324 --> 28:45.859
- Okay, um...
- Like it, do you like it?

28:45.893 --> 28:48.062
- Yeah, I'm just...
- You do?

28:48.095 --> 28:51.165
- I'm gonna move for a second.
- Yeah.

28:51.198 --> 28:53.500
- Okay.
- Yeah, lean in.

28:56.971 --> 29:00.007
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.110
That's what it looks like.

29:03.143 --> 29:05.346
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29:07.982 --> 29:10.484
- Get it.
- Okay.

29:10.518 --> 29:12.453
- Oh, sweetie!
- Ah, ah!

29:12.486 --> 29:14.288
- Oh, sweetie.
- Ah, ah!

29:14.321 --> 29:16.558
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Ah, ah!

29:16.591 --> 29:19.393
- Ah, ah!
- Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

29:19.426 --> 29:22.196
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Ah, ah!

29:22.229 --> 29:23.797
Yeah!

29:23.831 --> 29:25.899
Yeah.

29:37.478 --> 29:40.981
I'm... I'm the woman.

29:41.015 --> 29:43.417
I'm the woman.

29:56.297 --> 29:57.865
Honey?

29:57.898 --> 29:59.833
Are you okay?

29:59.867 --> 30:01.468
Yes, and I'm sorry.

30:03.538 --> 30:05.939
Where'd you fucking go?

30:10.210 --> 30:11.513
Fuck!

30:52.319 --> 30:54.054
You're awake?

30:54.088 --> 30:55.923
Mhm.

30:55.956 --> 30:58.359
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning, baby.

31:01.596 --> 31:04.198
I feel great!

31:04.231 --> 31:06.300
- Great.
- Honey,

31:06.333 --> 31:09.571
I just slept through
the whole night.

31:09.604 --> 31:12.172
I know, you didn't
get up and pee, or anything.

31:12.206 --> 31:14.308
I can't believe it.

31:14.341 --> 31:16.043
Uh, you deserve it.

31:16.076 --> 31:18.445
It's like a miracle.

31:18.479 --> 31:21.448
I haven't slept a whole night

31:21.482 --> 31:23.585
the entire third trimester.

31:23.618 --> 31:26.353
I know.

31:26.387 --> 31:28.422
Ahh.

31:28.455 --> 31:30.391
I'm glad.

31:30.424 --> 31:32.694
I wore myself out yesterday.

31:32.727 --> 31:34.562
- Yeah, you sure did.
- Yep.

31:34.596 --> 31:36.363
Yeah.

31:36.397 --> 31:39.266
Oh, how do you feel?

31:39.299 --> 31:42.035
Mm, I'm okay.

31:42.069 --> 31:44.539
I feel a little funny,
I didn't sleep much,

31:44.572 --> 31:46.974
- but I'm all right.
- No?

31:47.007 --> 31:49.644
Uh-uh, it was a bit
of a fraught night.

31:51.478 --> 31:53.280
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

31:53.313 --> 31:57.017
- It's okay.
- I felt so profoundly...

31:59.621 --> 32:01.221
...completed.

32:01.255 --> 32:03.558
I really appreciate it,
I'm sorry you had

32:03.591 --> 32:06.059
such a bad night.

32:06.093 --> 32:08.128
- Mm.
- I mean, don't you feel

32:08.162 --> 32:10.130
like we...

32:10.164 --> 32:11.599
we broke the mold?

32:11.633 --> 32:15.102
I feel like I... I broke the...

32:15.135 --> 32:16.638
the mold in some way.

32:16.671 --> 32:19.273
I, like, feel funky and weird.

32:19.306 --> 32:21.208
- Hm.
- Like,

32:21.241 --> 32:23.545
we can do anything.

32:23.578 --> 32:26.046
There's no rules,
we can do anything.

32:26.079 --> 32:27.615
Hm.

32:30.284 --> 32:32.152
No.

32:32.186 --> 32:35.088
I think...

32:35.122 --> 32:38.593
I mean,

32:38.626 --> 32:40.994
okay, if I'm being
totally honest.

32:41.028 --> 32:43.464
Mhm, which I want you to be.

32:43.497 --> 32:46.133
Okay.

32:46.166 --> 32:47.501
Um.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.743
Do you know how many times
my dad used the word "faggot"

32:55.777 --> 32:58.479
when I was a kid?

32:58.513 --> 33:00.615
That's so bad.

33:00.648 --> 33:03.350
Like, "Faggot this,
and faggot that."

33:03.383 --> 33:05.419
And that didn't even

33:05.452 --> 33:09.256
really mean "gay."

33:09.289 --> 33:11.492
It just meant

33:11.526 --> 33:14.094
"weak."

33:14.127 --> 33:16.598
And so, here I am,

33:16.631 --> 33:18.432
an adult man,

33:18.465 --> 33:21.636
who's in
a loving relationship...

33:21.669 --> 33:23.303
- Mhm.
- ...with a strong

33:23.337 --> 33:25.339
and beautiful woman, who has,

33:25.372 --> 33:27.307
at least biologically speaking,

33:27.341 --> 33:29.611
- proved my manliness.
- Totally.

33:29.644 --> 33:32.446
And all of a sudden
we're doing this thing

33:32.479 --> 33:35.449
where we're... we're conducting
this experiment.

33:35.482 --> 33:37.317
- Yeah?
- And then, the second

33:37.351 --> 33:40.320
it felt good,
my head came back in,

33:40.354 --> 33:43.223
and it was like, "What,
'cause you're a faggot?"

33:45.158 --> 33:47.261
- Okay.
- And... and... and that's terrible,

33:47.294 --> 33:50.397
and I'm sorry
I keep using that word.

33:50.430 --> 33:53.066
It's just,
it's obviously not me talking.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.703
- Yeah.
- It's... it's all the baggage

33:55.737 --> 33:58.506
from my hometown,
and from growing up

33:58.540 --> 34:00.675
- with an alpha father...
- Yeah.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.309
...and... and so,
when I was downstairs,

34:02.342 --> 34:04.077
I really started trying
to pick this apart

34:04.111 --> 34:07.314
and go like, "What...
what's at the core of this?"

34:07.347 --> 34:10.083
Because there's two things
that are competing inside of me.

34:10.117 --> 34:12.786
One is that, um,
I wanna be your partner,

34:12.820 --> 34:15.389
and I wanna be...
I wanna be truly open

34:15.422 --> 34:17.692
to new experiences
in the universe.

34:17.725 --> 34:19.827
Um, and the other side is,

34:19.860 --> 34:23.429
my dad was a homophobe,
and I just let my wife

34:23.463 --> 34:25.364
fuck me in the ass,

34:25.399 --> 34:28.770
and so all of a sudden
I felt like,

34:28.803 --> 34:30.638
"You're not a man."

34:30.672 --> 34:33.106
And then... and then,
I started thinking about

34:33.139 --> 34:35.342
all of the therapy
that I've had,

34:35.375 --> 34:37.512
and... and going like,

34:37.545 --> 34:40.347
"Why is this... you know,
why is this such an issue?"

34:40.380 --> 34:41.849
This shouldn't be such an issue,

34:41.882 --> 34:44.518
and maybe I would like it
if we did it again.

34:44.552 --> 34:46.219
If I could get past the shame.

34:46.253 --> 34:48.856
If I could get past
all the stuff that's built up

34:48.889 --> 34:51.158
in my head, and so I think
in the same way

34:51.190 --> 34:53.695
that you had to

34:53.728 --> 34:56.831
go on your journey

34:56.864 --> 34:59.867
to feel more in control,

34:59.901 --> 35:04.404
and... and to feel powerful,

35:04.438 --> 35:06.774
I think I got
some work to do, too.

35:06.808 --> 35:08.643
- Totally.
- You know?

35:08.676 --> 35:11.813
Yeah, what do...
what do you wanna do?

35:13.948 --> 35:16.551
I think I need to punch
somebody in the face.

35:20.187 --> 35:21.756
That...

35:21.789 --> 35:24.792
And also, I think
another important component

35:24.826 --> 35:29.363
of this is that I need
to know what it feels like

35:29.396 --> 35:31.633
to actually take
a full face punch.

35:33.601 --> 35:34.936
You want somebody
to punch you...?

35:34.969 --> 35:38.673
Punch me in the face.

35:38.706 --> 35:41.475
I hate this.

35:45.479 --> 35:46.781
Okay, jab.

35:48.415 --> 35:49.951
- Hello!
- One, two, one, two.

35:49.984 --> 35:52.319
Uh, hello, back here.

35:52.352 --> 35:54.187
Okay, give me a jab.

35:54.221 --> 35:55.923
- Hey, man.
- Give me a jab.

35:55.957 --> 35:58.325
One, duck, two.

35:58.358 --> 36:00.928
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

36:00.962 --> 36:02.362
Ah, it's good to see you.

36:02.396 --> 36:04.264
Hey, what's going on?
I'm Elliot.

36:04.297 --> 36:05.767
- Hi.
- What's your name?

36:05.800 --> 36:08.268
- I'm Josh.
- Josh, nice to meet you.

36:08.301 --> 36:10.237
Elliot, Jackie,
these are my friends.

36:10.270 --> 36:11.839
You guys look like
you're hanging tough in here.

36:11.873 --> 36:13.508
Yeah, hooking it up...
what's up, man?

36:13.541 --> 36:16.711
Uh, can I... can I steal you
for, like, 3 minutes?

36:18.713 --> 36:19.847
- Uh, you cool with it?
- Yeah.

36:19.881 --> 36:21.381
- Are we cool with that?
- Is that cool?

36:21.415 --> 36:22.917
- 4 minutes, it'll be real quick.
- Okay, a couple.

36:22.950 --> 36:24.819
- I got a little favor to ask.
- It's fine.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.921
All right, Josh,
100 jumping jacks.

36:26.954 --> 36:28.422
Count 'em out.

36:28.455 --> 36:29.691
When you're done,
I'll be back, okay?

36:29.724 --> 36:31.291
- All right.
- Okay.

36:31.324 --> 36:34.361
- I'll bring him right back.
- All right.

36:34.394 --> 36:38.900
One, two, three, four, five...

36:38.933 --> 36:42.570
Um, so here's the thing.

36:42.603 --> 36:45.439
Yeah?

36:45.472 --> 36:47.508
I would like you
to hit me in the face

36:47.542 --> 36:49.376
as hard as you can.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.881
Fight Club.

36:53.915 --> 36:55.983
Hm?

36:56.017 --> 36:57.451
You're Fight Clubbing me?

36:57.484 --> 36:58.853
Hey, did you do
a Fight Club to me?

37:00.621 --> 37:02.557
Oh, shit, that is from
Fight Club, isn't it?

37:02.590 --> 37:05.325
No, I kinda...
in the back of my head,

37:05.358 --> 37:08.495
I had some recognition,
but I didn't realize

37:08.529 --> 37:10.330
- it was something...
- It was it exactly.

37:10.363 --> 37:12.533
- That's exactly what it's from.
- Yeah.

37:12.567 --> 37:14.736
Okay, so I know you have to
get back in there.

37:14.769 --> 37:17.437
This is real quick,
if you could just punch me,

37:17.471 --> 37:19.974
and, um, if it's okay...

37:20.007 --> 37:22.744
if it's okay, I'd love to
be able to punch you back.

37:22.777 --> 37:24.879
- That would be super helpful.
- I can't tell

37:24.912 --> 37:26.379
if you guys are fucking with me.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.616
- Is this real?
- It...

37:28.649 --> 37:30.350
Yeah.

37:32.319 --> 37:33.921
- No, no way.
- Okay, um.

37:33.955 --> 37:35.056
You're out of your fucking mind.

37:35.089 --> 37:35.957
I'm not gonna punch you.

37:35.990 --> 37:38.291
- Here, here's the thing.
- In the face?

37:38.325 --> 37:39.994
I swear to God
I won't be upset.

37:40.027 --> 37:41.461
I won't either.

37:41.495 --> 37:42.530
She won't either.

37:42.563 --> 37:43.831
Okay, here's the thing.

37:43.865 --> 37:45.633
Do you remember
at our baby shower

37:45.666 --> 37:46.901
when you came
up to me at the end,

37:46.934 --> 37:48.603
and you hugged me,
and you were just like,

37:48.636 --> 37:49.904
"Brother, anything you need...

37:49.937 --> 37:51.773
- Yeah.
- ...anything at all?"

37:51.806 --> 37:54.041
- Yeah, I...
- This is it.

37:54.075 --> 37:55.375
Not gonna do it, I'm sorry.

37:55.408 --> 37:56.644
- I lied to you.
- This is it.

37:56.677 --> 37:58.345
I can't.

37:58.378 --> 37:59.514
- I've...
- Okay, so I'll tell,

37:59.547 --> 38:00.982
I'll tell, I'll tell you why,
I'll tell you why

38:01.015 --> 38:02.617
'cause I do think
it'll make a difference.

38:02.650 --> 38:03.416
It's this thing that

38:03.450 --> 38:04.619
- Jackie and I are doing...
- Okay.

38:04.652 --> 38:07.021
...because, uh, because
we're about to have a baby...

38:07.054 --> 38:07.955
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...and we're trying to become

38:07.989 --> 38:09.489
fully realized humans.

38:09.524 --> 38:10.792
I mean, you know,
I've talked to you about

38:10.825 --> 38:12.392
my dad stuff, my rape stuff.

38:12.425 --> 38:13.661
You know, I've been in therapy

38:13.694 --> 38:16.030
since I was
fuckin' 18 years old.

38:16.063 --> 38:18.633
And, obviously,
you know, they're like,

38:18.666 --> 38:19.834
"You shouldn't punch people."

38:19.867 --> 38:22.804
So, I punch walls,
I, like, kick things,

38:22.837 --> 38:25.640
but what I've never done
in my entire life

38:25.673 --> 38:27.575
is I've never been
punched in the face.

38:27.608 --> 38:28.375
And my dad used to do

38:28.408 --> 38:30.077
- this to me all the time.
- Yeah.

38:30.111 --> 38:34.048
So, I am so afraid of this,
and I just, I, I just need,

38:34.081 --> 38:35.448
- I need the full thing.
- Not happening.

38:35.482 --> 38:38.418
I appreciate everything
you just told me.

38:38.451 --> 38:41.122
I'm sorry you had a mean dad.

38:41.155 --> 38:43.991
And whatever you guys
are going through

38:44.025 --> 38:45.092
feels weird.

38:45.126 --> 38:47.728
Uh, I can't help you with this.

38:47.762 --> 38:50.097
I'm facing

38:50.131 --> 38:52.133
my biggest fear.

38:52.166 --> 38:55.435
This wall of fear.

38:55.468 --> 38:57.505
And her and I together,

38:57.538 --> 39:00.775
are gonna get over
that fuckin' wall.

39:00.808 --> 39:01.742
Cool, man.

39:01.776 --> 39:03.044
So we can be...

39:03.077 --> 39:05.146
I'm not goin' over
the wall with you.

39:05.179 --> 39:08.115
I don't need you to,
I just need you to punch me.

39:08.149 --> 39:09.650
There's a kid
in the other room waiting.

39:09.684 --> 39:11.451
You punch guys in the face

39:11.484 --> 39:12.485
- every day!
- Yeah,

39:12.520 --> 39:14.655
'cause I don't care
about them, and also...

39:14.689 --> 39:16.624
Okay, can I punch
you in the face?

39:16.657 --> 39:18.491
- No.
- Please?

39:18.526 --> 39:19.927
Absolutely not.

39:19.961 --> 39:21.963
I just need to
punch you in the face.

39:21.996 --> 39:23.764
- Well, okay.
- Dude, no.

39:23.798 --> 39:25.633
One of the two
is gonna happen.

39:25.666 --> 39:27.034
Neither of the two are gonna

39:27.068 --> 39:28.501
- happen actually.
- Okay, punch me in the face.

39:28.536 --> 39:30.771
- I am not gonna...
- Punch me in the face.

39:30.805 --> 39:31.939
- Elliot, I'm not gonna...
- Punch me in the face.

39:31.973 --> 39:32.840
- I'm not punching...
- I'm gonna punch you in the face

39:32.874 --> 39:34.542
if you don't punch
me in the face.

39:34.575 --> 39:35.475
I'm gonna
punch you in the face.

39:35.509 --> 39:37.511
You're not gonna
punch me in the face.

39:37.545 --> 39:38.613
I'm gonna... Punch me in the face!

39:38.646 --> 39:39.446
- No one's getting punched.
- Punch me in the face!

39:39.479 --> 39:40.413
How 'bout this,
no one's fucking

39:40.447 --> 39:42.083
- getting punched.
- I'm gonna punch you!

39:42.116 --> 39:43.450
Ah!

39:45.019 --> 39:46.621
Ho!

39:46.654 --> 39:47.889
Ooh.

39:47.922 --> 39:49.156
That was...

39:49.190 --> 39:50.625
Are you bleeding?

39:50.658 --> 39:52.627
- Ah, shit.
- You're fuckin' bleeding.

39:52.660 --> 39:53.594
- Oh, brother!
- Fuckin' damn it, man.

39:53.628 --> 39:54.996
I'm sorry, but that was amazing!

39:55.029 --> 39:56.597
- What are you doing?
- Come on, that was amazing.

39:56.631 --> 39:58.165
That wasn't amazing,
that was ridiculous.

39:58.199 --> 39:59.432
Get the fuck outta here.

39:59.466 --> 40:00.534
Josh, go in the other room.

40:00.568 --> 40:02.469
- Oh!
- Okay, okay, so you're mad.

40:02.503 --> 40:04.105
- Jackie...
- So, punch me in the face!

40:04.138 --> 40:04.972
- I'm gonna...
- Come on, come on, come on,

40:05.006 --> 40:06.107
- come on, come on.
- I need you to go.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.141
Dude, dude, dude, dude, come...

40:09.844 --> 40:11.212
Oh!

40:11.245 --> 40:13.581
- Oh!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

40:13.614 --> 40:14.982
Oh!

40:15.016 --> 40:15.917
- Hey!
- Honey, honey.

40:15.950 --> 40:18.152
- Elliot, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

40:18.185 --> 40:19.520
Flip over.

40:19.553 --> 40:21.989
Oh, my God.

40:22.023 --> 40:23.891
Dude, I'm so sorry.

40:23.925 --> 40:24.992
Elliot, I'm so sorry.

40:27.962 --> 40:29.196
You're okay?

40:29.230 --> 40:30.564
Yeah.

40:30.598 --> 40:33.534
- He's okay!
- Oh, I went out.

40:33.567 --> 40:35.569
- I went out!
- Yeah.

40:35.603 --> 40:36.637
Oh, that really...

40:36.671 --> 40:38.572
- Fuck you!
- That was crazy!

40:38.606 --> 40:39.907
Can I help you,
let me help you both up,

40:39.941 --> 40:41.676
then you can get
the fuck out, okay?

40:41.709 --> 40:43.010
- Sorry. You did it!
- Do I have a black eye?

40:43.044 --> 40:43.844
- You do a little bit!
- Yeah, you have a black eye

40:43.878 --> 40:45.046
'cause you're a fuckin' idiot.

40:45.079 --> 40:45.880
Now, can you please leave?

40:45.913 --> 40:47.648
Dude, I know
you're upset, but...

40:47.682 --> 40:48.950
- You have no idea.
- ...it's the best thing

40:48.983 --> 40:49.684
- in my entire life.
- I don't wanna

40:49.717 --> 40:50.818
- hear it right now.
- Can I?

40:50.851 --> 40:51.686
No, don't touch me.

40:51.719 --> 40:54.121
Okay, some day
you're gonna understand.

40:54.155 --> 40:55.089
No, I won't!

40:55.122 --> 40:56.824
You'll be lucky if
we talk some day soon.

40:56.857 --> 40:57.758
- Get the fuck out, Elliot.
- I love you.

40:57.792 --> 40:59.260
- No, Jackie.
- Let's get out.

40:59.293 --> 41:01.529
- Okay, I feel you.
- Let's go. Thank you.

41:01.562 --> 41:04.598
No, don't thank me,
just fuckin' go.

43:06.887 --> 43:07.855
First of all, we have to

43:07.888 --> 43:09.056
- thank you.
- Oh, my God.

43:09.090 --> 43:10.925
The things you said to us

43:10.958 --> 43:12.226
- resonated.
- Something broke open.

43:12.259 --> 43:13.160
- You asked the question...
- You were like,

43:13.194 --> 43:14.261
- "What do you need?
- ..."What do you need?"

43:14.295 --> 43:17.364
I've never been this
confident in my entire life!

43:17.398 --> 43:19.300
That's, that's, that's great!

43:19.333 --> 43:22.336
Also, when you were saying
you gotta trust each other,

43:22.369 --> 43:24.839
- and, like, fuck everybody else.
- And fuck everybody else!

43:24.872 --> 43:26.874
Everything in us went, "Whoa!

43:26.907 --> 43:28.342
- Break the cycle."
- Like, stop.

43:28.375 --> 43:29.310
What do we need?

43:29.343 --> 43:31.178
- What would do that?
- Yeah, 'cause all that...

43:31.212 --> 43:32.646
- And the oxytocin...
- Everything you,

43:32.680 --> 43:35.216
everything you said
made sense in our brains,

43:35.249 --> 43:36.851
- but we've never put it...
- But we had to do it.

43:36.884 --> 43:38.719
- ..into effect.
- Got it.

43:38.752 --> 43:41.088
And more stuff
with my dad, obviously.

43:41.122 --> 43:44.225
- But, like, the thing...
- Her dad's money,

43:44.258 --> 43:45.025
- drugs.
- I realized

43:45.059 --> 43:47.995
I needed, sexually,
to give it.

43:48.028 --> 43:50.264
- I needed to fuck him.
- She wanted to fuck me.

43:50.297 --> 43:52.867
It just seemed like
the only answer..

43:52.900 --> 43:55.703
So we went to a shop,
and we got a strap-on,

43:55.736 --> 43:56.904
- and then we went home...
- And then...

43:56.937 --> 43:57.838
...and we did it,

43:57.872 --> 43:59.940
and it hurt,

43:59.974 --> 44:00.875
um, for me.

44:00.908 --> 44:02.343
For you...

44:02.376 --> 44:04.879
Great, but emotionally,

44:04.912 --> 44:08.782
- I felt like a rock star.
- Mm-hm.

44:08.816 --> 44:10.918
- And then...
- And then, I cried.

44:10.951 --> 44:13.120
I mean, I didn't cry
around you because I didn't,

44:13.154 --> 44:15.389
I didn't want that to tamp down,

44:15.422 --> 44:17.358
- you know, your moment because...
- And how nice is that?

44:17.391 --> 44:18.993
And then it, the chain reaction.

44:19.026 --> 44:21.729
Somehow, the Pavlovian
connection between

44:21.762 --> 44:24.098
masculinity, and sexuality,

44:24.131 --> 44:28.469
and violence,
the smallness I felt,

44:28.502 --> 44:30.704
I was six years old again.

44:30.738 --> 44:34.074
And I was sitting
at my kitchen table

44:34.108 --> 44:36.043
in my childhood house,

44:36.076 --> 44:39.380
and I just spilled
a glass of orange juice.

44:39.413 --> 44:41.048
And my father turned, and he,

44:41.081 --> 44:43.851
and he cocked a fist
like he was gonna punch me

44:43.884 --> 44:47.788
because I spilled a fucking
glass of orange juice, okay?

44:47.821 --> 44:52.059
And that fear has dictated

44:52.092 --> 44:54.128
so many of the choices
that I've made

44:54.161 --> 44:57.164
- my entire life.
- Like, the cycle of backing away

44:57.198 --> 44:59.900
from that energy had to break.

44:59.934 --> 45:01.468
Because I'm a grown-ass man,

45:01.502 --> 45:03.437
and I'm about to be a father.

45:03.470 --> 45:05.039
And so, I can't be scared.

45:05.072 --> 45:07.174
I can't be scared of a fist,

45:07.208 --> 45:09.176
or, like, a plastic dick

45:09.210 --> 45:11.946
the way that I have
been my entire life.

45:11.979 --> 45:14.014
So, I went to visit my friend.

45:14.048 --> 45:16.784
- It was amazing!
- And I punched him in the face!

45:16.817 --> 45:18.285
And he didn't...

45:18.319 --> 45:19.453
I asked him at first,

45:19.486 --> 45:21.355
I was like, "Can I, can I..."

45:21.388 --> 45:23.190
Well, I asked him
if he'd punch me,

45:23.224 --> 45:25.159
and he was like, "No,
I'm not gonna punch you."

45:25.192 --> 45:26.493
And I was like, "Come on,
please, punch me."

45:26.528 --> 45:28.229
- And he was like, "No!"
- Like, don't be a pussy!

45:30.431 --> 45:32.199
- I punched him!
- Got it.

45:32.233 --> 45:34.868
And then he still
wouldn't punch me!

45:34.902 --> 45:35.836
So then...

45:38.540 --> 45:40.307
- I was amazed.
- And then,

45:40.341 --> 45:43.444
and then I saw it happen on his
face when he was just like...

45:43.477 --> 45:45.212
And then, he was like

45:45.246 --> 45:46.548
black out.

45:48.816 --> 45:51.118
Just punched me in the face.

45:51.151 --> 45:52.453
It was the best.

45:52.486 --> 45:54.088
And then, and then...

45:56.023 --> 45:58.926
...and then I'm
seeing stars for a second.

45:58.959 --> 46:00.562
But, I could tell, like...

46:00.595 --> 46:02.329
But then I came up,

46:02.363 --> 46:07.468
- and I was clear as day.
- Yeah.

46:07.501 --> 46:08.637
You know what,
give me a second.

46:08.670 --> 46:13.541
I'll be right back,
I'm just gonna grab something.

46:13.575 --> 46:15.109
She's the bomb.

46:15.142 --> 46:17.011
Yeah.

46:17.044 --> 46:18.513
Oh, man.

46:18.546 --> 46:21.015
I could take a nap.

46:21.048 --> 46:22.550
Yeah.

46:22.584 --> 46:23.417
Maybe I'll take a nap.

46:23.450 --> 46:24.385
Can we go take a nap?

46:24.418 --> 46:26.320
- Wanna go take a nap?
- Just a midday nap?

46:26.353 --> 46:27.921
And then go to a rave?

46:27.955 --> 46:29.823
How 'bout the zoo?

46:29.857 --> 46:31.025
You wanna go to the zoo?

46:31.058 --> 46:32.459
I think they have
pandas there now.

46:32.493 --> 46:34.161
Did they get pandas at the zoo?

46:34.194 --> 46:36.063
So, this is for you.

46:36.096 --> 46:37.398
What's this?

46:37.431 --> 46:40.467
It's a full refund.

46:40.501 --> 46:42.570
- Um.
- You deserve it!

46:42.604 --> 46:44.171
You deserve so much
more than this.

46:44.204 --> 46:45.873
It's really okay.

46:45.906 --> 46:48.375
I don't think there's
any amount of money that

46:48.409 --> 46:49.376
either of you could give me

46:49.410 --> 46:52.413
that would make it okay
for us to work together.

46:55.015 --> 46:56.450
Wha...

46:56.483 --> 46:59.253
This whole thing, the eye,

46:59.286 --> 47:02.222
the battery, the pegging,

47:02.256 --> 47:04.091
- just there's a lot of...
- I don't think it's battery.

47:04.124 --> 47:06.528
There's a lot of
liability issues here that

47:06.561 --> 47:09.396
just make me feel
super uncomfortable.

47:09.430 --> 47:13.233
So, I think it's probably gonna
be best if both of you just

47:13.267 --> 47:14.335
- get up...
- Wait a minute.

47:14.368 --> 47:17.338
- ...and leave.
- Wait a minute.

47:17.371 --> 47:20.608
- Babe?
- Wait a minute.

47:20.642 --> 47:22.109
So, wait.

47:24.178 --> 47:26.347
- You want us to go?
- Yeah.

47:26.380 --> 47:28.082
Are you still
gonna be our doula?

47:28.115 --> 47:30.552
No, no doula.

47:30.585 --> 47:32.119
All done.

47:32.152 --> 47:33.220
Finito.

47:33.253 --> 47:36.457
Need you both
to get up, and leave.

47:43.197 --> 47:45.366
The thing that's just, like,

47:45.399 --> 47:48.670
nuts is that it's not evident,
and it's not so apparent

47:48.703 --> 47:51.205
- that this is amazing.
- Other people don't get it.

47:51.238 --> 47:52.640
No, it's incredible.

47:52.674 --> 47:54.542
How do other people not get it?

47:54.576 --> 47:55.976
I mean, and that's hard.

47:56.009 --> 47:58.412
If I didn't have you,
I'd be so lonely.

47:58.445 --> 48:01.048
- Honey!
- To have these revelations,

48:01.081 --> 48:02.449
- to really...
- I see them,

48:02.483 --> 48:04.118
I see what you're going through.

48:04.151 --> 48:06.954
...have my brain
break open in these ways.

48:06.987 --> 48:09.056
And have other people
look at it and go like,

48:09.089 --> 48:10.391
"Eh, not into it."

48:10.424 --> 48:13.528
It's so weird 'cause I see you.

48:13.561 --> 48:15.996
- You see me.
- And look, I get it with Zach.

48:16.029 --> 48:18.265
Like, I punched my
dear friend in the face,

48:18.298 --> 48:19.967
- and that might have been...
- Zach? Yeah.

48:20.000 --> 48:20.702
...a little fucked up...

48:20.735 --> 48:22.637
- But Maya.
- ...but still!

48:22.670 --> 48:26.541
- Maya.
- She, like, talks the talk,

48:26.574 --> 48:28.510
- but doesn't walk the walk.
- Walk the walk.

48:28.543 --> 48:30.277
No, she's a fake truth teller.

48:30.310 --> 48:33.280
Yeah, she's living
in her own lies.

48:33.313 --> 48:36.049
Well, I think you,
I think we live in a culture

48:36.083 --> 48:38.118
that's not prepared
for the truth.

48:38.152 --> 48:39.186
I think we live in a culture

48:39.219 --> 48:41.556
- that can't handle the truth.
- I think we do.

48:41.589 --> 48:43.390
'Cause it's just easier
to lie to each other.

48:43.424 --> 48:45.527
It is, like, how many times
has your mom been like,

48:45.560 --> 48:47.629
"Do you like the casserole?"
and I'm like, "I love it!"

48:47.662 --> 48:49.096
Oh, exactly, and how many times

48:49.129 --> 48:50.698
has my mom been like,
"Was I a good mother?"

48:50.732 --> 48:52.966
And I'm like, "Of course, Mom."

48:53.000 --> 48:54.201
We do it, why?

48:54.234 --> 48:55.969
Just because it's easier.

48:56.003 --> 48:58.238
It's just like a path
of least resistance.

48:58.272 --> 49:00.407
I know, and that's why
we're so fucked!

49:00.441 --> 49:02.710
We're fucked as a country
because of this

49:02.744 --> 49:06.113
- epidemic of lying.
- We're fucked as a world.

49:06.146 --> 49:08.148
Maybe we have been afraid
of that with each other.

49:08.182 --> 49:09.116
That's why we had a...

49:09.149 --> 49:10.752
And now, for the first time,
we're like,

49:10.785 --> 49:12.720
"I can totally show you me,

49:12.754 --> 49:14.188
and you can
totally show me you."

49:14.221 --> 49:16.123
- We can just, like, be like...
- And we love it!

49:16.156 --> 49:17.324
...like, "This is me.

49:17.357 --> 49:18.760
- This is me.
- This is me.

49:18.793 --> 49:21.395
- And I love you!
- And I love you!

49:21.428 --> 49:23.130
You are everything!

49:23.163 --> 49:26.066
- You are everything to me, babe.
- Oh.

49:26.099 --> 49:28.202
I trust you more than anyone.

49:28.235 --> 49:31.773
I trust you more than anyone.

49:31.806 --> 49:34.208
And you're gonna have my baby.

49:34.241 --> 49:35.677
- And...
- I've been thinkin'.

49:35.710 --> 49:36.578
What are you thinkin'?

49:36.611 --> 49:38.580
- Since this whole Maya thing.
- Uh-huh.

49:38.613 --> 49:41.148
Like, "Ah, where we
gonna find a Doula now?"

49:41.181 --> 49:43.651
- I know what you're thinkin'.
- I don't, I don't think we need

49:43.685 --> 49:45.753
some other stranger
coming into this.

49:45.787 --> 49:48.222
We don't need
anybody else comin' in

49:48.255 --> 49:51.091
and coaching us
on what the truth

49:51.124 --> 49:52.459
of our experience is,

49:52.493 --> 49:54.394
bringing our
baby into the world.

49:54.428 --> 49:58.198
I think you can be my doula.

49:58.232 --> 50:00.267
I've never seen
a better doula...

50:00.300 --> 50:01.101
- That makes me...
- ...than the one right in

50:01.134 --> 50:04.037
- front of me.
- ...makes me wanna cry.

50:04.071 --> 50:07.107
- But, you're right.
- You can take the pain.

50:57.424 --> 50:59.694
We should probably get back
before it gets dark.

51:02.262 --> 51:03.831
Okay.

51:03.865 --> 51:05.299
Let's go.

51:11.238 --> 51:13.508
No! There's not
a path over here!

51:13.541 --> 51:15.442
There's not a path over here!

51:15.475 --> 51:17.177
It can't be that far.

51:17.210 --> 51:19.146
We were just
on the fucking path!

51:19.179 --> 51:20.480
No, we weren't
just on the path.

51:20.515 --> 51:21.481
We were just on the path.

51:21.516 --> 51:22.650
- We were coming down it.
- By "just," do you mean

51:22.684 --> 51:24.484
20 minutes ago?

51:24.519 --> 51:25.853
Now we're way off!

51:25.887 --> 51:28.288
- Okay.
- Would you stop going up there?

51:28.322 --> 51:31.124
I really know
the path is not up there.

51:31.158 --> 51:33.595
I think we might
have to go back up

51:33.628 --> 51:34.762
to go back down.

51:34.796 --> 51:36.531
But down is
clearly the direction

51:36.564 --> 51:38.666
we need to generally be going.

51:40.267 --> 51:43.170
Um.

51:43.203 --> 51:44.606
Let's go, let's go this way.

51:44.639 --> 51:45.439
Yeah, okay.

51:45.472 --> 51:47.875
Yeah, I think down
is a good idea.

51:47.909 --> 51:50.678
- Ow! Ow.
- Ow.

51:50.712 --> 51:53.180
- Ah! Ah! Fuck!
- Oh, my gosh.

51:53.213 --> 51:55.617
- Okay, okay.
- We're... We've gone.

51:55.650 --> 51:57.518
No, we're totally
off the fucking path.

51:57.552 --> 51:58.485
- I understand that.
- Will you keep your

51:58.519 --> 52:01.188
- voice down?
- Can you not be condescending

52:01.221 --> 52:02.322
- right now?
- I'm asking you

52:02.356 --> 52:04.892
to keep your voice down
for a very practical reason

52:04.926 --> 52:06.360
- because I feel like...
- Yeah, what's the practical

52:06.393 --> 52:07.327
- reason?
- ...we're like,

52:07.361 --> 52:09.897
like shouting, like,
"Help, we're lost."

52:09.931 --> 52:12.700
Like, "Help, ow! Ow!"

52:12.734 --> 52:14.636
- Okay, can, can you...
- If there are gangs out here,

52:14.669 --> 52:16.203
- they're just gonna like...
- Jackie.

52:16.236 --> 52:18.271
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!
- What?

52:18.305 --> 52:21.509
Can I just talk for ten seconds

52:21.542 --> 52:24.512
without you getting
all fucking vicious on me?

52:24.545 --> 52:26.279
I'd like to make a suggestion.

52:26.313 --> 52:28.415
Mm-hm?

52:28.448 --> 52:31.418
Okay, do you
remember that podcast

52:31.451 --> 52:33.286
that we were listening to

52:33.320 --> 52:36.223
where the two guys
went hiking in Muir Beach

52:36.256 --> 52:37.959
up by San Francisco?

52:37.992 --> 52:41.395
And they got up to the top,
and it was dark,

52:41.428 --> 52:42.329
and one guy was like,

52:42.362 --> 52:44.231
"Let's just stop here
for the night."

52:44.264 --> 52:46.299
And the other guy was like,
"I'm gonna keep going.

52:46.333 --> 52:47.635
- I'm just gonna push through."
- You're not suggesting

52:47.669 --> 52:48.903
that we are stopping.

52:48.936 --> 52:50.972
But the second guy,
the guy who kept going,

52:51.005 --> 52:52.540
he fell off the fucking cliff.

52:52.573 --> 52:54.441
And the guy who stayed there,

52:54.474 --> 52:56.978
he found that other guy's
body the next morning

52:57.011 --> 52:59.647
- with his head bashed in!
- We're not just gonna

52:59.681 --> 53:01.549
sit like ducks

53:01.582 --> 53:02.917
- out in the middle of the woods!
- I'm trying to do

53:02.950 --> 53:04.652
the safest thing.

53:04.686 --> 53:06.286
I'm trying to do
the safest thing

53:06.319 --> 53:08.589
for me, and you, and our baby.

53:08.623 --> 53:10.825
- And you can sleep...
- Honey, just 'cause you hit

53:10.858 --> 53:11.893
one guy!

53:11.926 --> 53:13.528
- You hit one guy...
- I'll put my coat on you.

53:13.561 --> 53:14.796
- ...and now you think...
- I'll make a fire.

53:14.829 --> 53:16.931
...if we get attacked
by multiple people,

53:16.964 --> 53:18.533
or animals, or whatever,

53:18.566 --> 53:20.434
that you're gonna
be able to, like,

53:20.467 --> 53:21.936
get us through the night?

53:21.969 --> 53:23.604
Honestly!

53:25.506 --> 53:28.475
That was really mean.

53:28.509 --> 53:29.443
- I'm just...
- I mean, that was,

53:29.476 --> 53:30.978
that was, like...

53:31.012 --> 53:34.414
Hitting that guy,
you know that was my thing.

53:34.448 --> 53:35.917
- And...
- You know that that,

53:35.950 --> 53:39.020
- you know what a huge...
- I know internally

53:39.053 --> 53:40.555
- that that was...
- ...demarcation

53:40.588 --> 53:42.557
that was to make me feel

53:42.590 --> 53:44.759
like I could be a protector

53:44.792 --> 53:46.794
of you, and our child,

53:46.828 --> 53:49.296
- and our family, and now I do...
- Like...

53:49.329 --> 53:50.397
...and now, and now I do.

53:50.430 --> 53:52.867
And you said you trusted me,
you said you wanted me

53:52.900 --> 53:54.669
- to be your doula!
- I didn't say that I wanted

53:54.702 --> 53:56.938
- to sleep in the woods.
- It's not fucking fair!

53:56.971 --> 53:59.372
I'm not a baby,
I'm not a fucking child!

53:59.406 --> 54:00.975
- I'm not drawing a line.
- I'm not a goddamn junkie

54:01.008 --> 54:02.442
like your father!

54:02.476 --> 54:05.278
Why would you say that?

54:05.312 --> 54:07.280
What? Is that an unfair thing?

54:07.314 --> 54:10.350
Is that an untrue thing?

54:10.383 --> 54:11.853
How...

54:11.886 --> 54:13.721
I have nothing to say to you.

54:13.755 --> 54:16.858
I have nothing to say to you.

54:16.891 --> 54:18.993
I hope that we can
do the rest of this

54:19.026 --> 54:21.996
silently, or just
part our ways out here.

54:22.029 --> 54:23.564
Okay, but what if
the thing happens

54:23.598 --> 54:25.032
that happened in the podcast?

54:27.769 --> 54:29.737
Well, it was meant to be.

54:41.381 --> 54:43.951
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

54:43.985 --> 54:46.521
That shouldn't
have been aimed at you.

54:46.554 --> 54:47.889
No?

54:47.922 --> 54:50.558
Who should it have
been aimed at, Elliot?

55:39.507 --> 55:40.541
Do you like it?

55:40.575 --> 55:42.442
Yeah!

55:42.475 --> 55:43.611
Sort of picks up this...

55:43.644 --> 55:46.113
Does anybody need anything else?

55:46.147 --> 55:48.850
More coffee, or... No.

55:48.883 --> 55:51.853
When is the baby actually due?

55:51.886 --> 55:53.955
Uh, one more month.

55:53.988 --> 55:55.790
Four weeks.

55:55.823 --> 55:56.924
No more drinks?

55:56.958 --> 55:57.892
Good, we good?

55:57.925 --> 55:59.459
Everybody cool?

55:59.492 --> 56:00.828
For a little while.

56:00.862 --> 56:03.496
I'm so worried
about your eye, honey.

56:03.531 --> 56:05.398
- My eye's okay.
- Don't you think we need to put

56:05.432 --> 56:06.901
- ice on it?
- No, it actually doesn't hurt

56:06.934 --> 56:07.735
at all anymore.

56:07.768 --> 56:09.937
It really hurt at first,
but it hurt...

56:09.971 --> 56:10.905
I'll tell ya about it later.

56:10.938 --> 56:12.472
- Bob?
- Hey, Dad?

56:12.506 --> 56:13.841
Bob?

56:13.875 --> 56:14.942
Yeah?

56:14.976 --> 56:16.878
Will you come over here?

56:16.911 --> 56:18.813
Sure, sure.

56:23.017 --> 56:24.552
Here we go!

56:26.787 --> 56:27.755
Here I am.

56:27.788 --> 56:31.458
- Hey!
- Hey, thanks!

56:31.491 --> 56:32.459
So.

56:34.228 --> 56:37.064
I know it's weird, it's like
we've called this meeting.

56:37.098 --> 56:39.499
- Here! Here!
- We've called you here...

56:39.533 --> 56:42.770
- Today.
- ...today to, uh,

56:42.803 --> 56:45.438
- well, I'm joking around.
- Well, we have, we have

56:45.472 --> 56:48.075
because we, um...

56:48.109 --> 56:49.644
We've been going through this

56:49.677 --> 56:52.479
intense transformation.

56:52.513 --> 56:54.882
We've been on kind of a quest.

56:54.916 --> 56:56.617
- Mm.
- Hm.

56:56.651 --> 57:00.922
And, um, we've had
some revelations

57:00.955 --> 57:02.489
- that we'd...
- Oh!

57:02.523 --> 57:04.792
And we wanted to share
those with you guys.

57:06.861 --> 57:09.096
- Yeah.
- Great hummus.

57:09.130 --> 57:10.765
Thank you.

57:10.798 --> 57:13.200
You have anymore?

57:13.234 --> 57:14.969
No.

57:15.002 --> 57:16.070
- No, there's...
- That's it.

57:16.103 --> 57:17.772
...there's no more hummus, Dad.

57:17.805 --> 57:21.242
So when, when
is the baby coming?

57:21.275 --> 57:24.512
It's in, it's in four weeks,
three and a half.

57:24.545 --> 57:26.814
Ah, right, right.

57:26.847 --> 57:28.716
Final countdown,
as they said.

57:28.749 --> 57:31.752
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:31.786 --> 57:35.156
So, we, we have realized that

57:35.189 --> 57:38.025
the thing

57:38.059 --> 57:40.861
that set all this off

57:40.895 --> 57:42.630
was about being parents

57:42.663 --> 57:46.067
and how we feel
we've been parented.

57:46.100 --> 57:50.771
- And, and, some of the...
- And...

57:50.805 --> 57:55.009
...issues we might hold onto,

57:55.042 --> 57:59.213
which have something
to do with, um...

57:59.246 --> 58:01.282
- You.
- ...stuff, stuff... You.

58:01.315 --> 58:04.151
I can't take
my eyes off your eye.

58:04.185 --> 58:05.152
It's okay, it's okay.

58:05.186 --> 58:07.254
- I'm okay.
- Don't you want an ice pack

58:07.288 --> 58:08.089
- or something?
- I'm okay.

58:08.122 --> 58:10.057
- I'm just so concerned.
- Okay, guys.

58:10.091 --> 58:11.959
There are lots of good things.

58:11.993 --> 58:14.295
It can hemorrhage,
you can get a hemorrhage

58:14.328 --> 58:15.763
- in your eye and a blood clot.
- He's not gonna get,

58:15.796 --> 58:17.031
he's not gonna
get a hemorrhage.

58:17.064 --> 58:18.933
- My eye is fine.
- We do need to, you know,

58:18.966 --> 58:21.902
I just... What did you wanna say?

58:21.936 --> 58:24.805
We just need to be

58:24.839 --> 58:28.142
- honest.
- Okay, honest, go.

58:28.175 --> 58:31.579
So you have your
hand on your cheek?

58:31.612 --> 58:33.047
Yeah.

58:33.080 --> 58:35.182
- Um, do you wanna? Or, should I?
- I can take it off.

58:35.216 --> 58:36.884
Should I?

58:36.917 --> 58:38.619
- Should I? Okay.
- Okay.

58:38.652 --> 58:41.555
Okay, Dad, I'm afraid of you.

58:44.191 --> 58:47.128
Right now?

58:47.161 --> 58:49.697
Um, always.

58:49.730 --> 58:51.599
Always, I always have been.

58:51.632 --> 58:54.802
Your, um, anger, um,

58:54.835 --> 58:56.137
well, it scared me
when I was a kid

58:56.170 --> 58:58.672
'cause I was much
smaller than you.

58:58.706 --> 59:03.110
And, um, and it scares me now

59:03.144 --> 59:08.082
because I don't wanna be
that way with our daughter

59:08.115 --> 59:09.884
when she's born.

59:09.917 --> 59:14.288
Well, get rid of that so
you don't pass it on to

59:14.321 --> 59:16.157
your whippersnapper there.

59:16.190 --> 59:19.593
Well, yeah, that's,
that's what I'm trying to do.

59:19.627 --> 59:20.961
- Um...
- But, honey,

59:20.995 --> 59:23.264
we've dealt with all that stuff.

59:23.297 --> 59:28.035
Okay, but actually,
we haven't dealt with it at all.

59:28.069 --> 59:30.738
Do you, do you remember

59:30.771 --> 59:32.907
what he's talking about?

59:32.940 --> 59:35.376
Mm, not specifically, but...

59:35.409 --> 59:37.278
Do you remember all
the times when you would

59:37.311 --> 59:39.613
pinch me, or you'd spank me,

59:39.647 --> 59:42.683
or you'd cock a fist back
like you were gonna hit me?

59:42.716 --> 59:44.618
- Do you remember that? No?
- Mm-mm.

59:44.652 --> 59:46.187
- No.
- He never punched you

59:46.220 --> 59:49.056
- with his fist.
- You seriously don't remember?

59:49.090 --> 59:51.992
I don't remember
a lot of things.

59:52.026 --> 59:54.728
- Really?
- Really.

59:54.762 --> 59:56.297
- Really?
- Really.

59:56.330 --> 59:58.032
- Really?
- Really!

59:58.065 --> 59:59.333
It's gotta be
in there somewhere.

59:59.366 --> 01:00:02.169
- Well, I don't remember...
- You're choosing

01:00:02.203 --> 01:00:03.237
to not remember.

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:07.041
- You almost drowned him.
- Huh?

01:00:07.074 --> 01:00:08.642
- Nothing.
- What do you wanna say?

01:00:08.676 --> 01:00:09.677
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.179
Oh, in the pool,
when you got pissed off at me

01:00:12.213 --> 01:00:14.682
because you thought
I should be able to swim,

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:17.151
and I couldn't swim,
and I was scared of the water,

01:00:17.184 --> 01:00:18.219
and you told me
to figure it out,

01:00:18.252 --> 01:00:21.188
and you turned around
and you went back inside?

01:00:21.222 --> 01:00:23.224
And you swam.

01:00:23.257 --> 01:00:25.025
- Well...
- Could you not laugh?

01:00:25.059 --> 01:00:27.761
Please don't laugh
about it, Richard.

01:00:27.795 --> 01:00:28.796
Mom came out,

01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:31.098
and she had to jump in the pool

01:00:31.132 --> 01:00:33.067
with all her clothes on
and pull me out.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.068
- Exactly!
- I didn't actually

01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:36.904
magically learn to swim.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:39.073
She's a better
swimmer than I am.

01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:45.346
Okay, Dad, do you remember,

01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:48.082
do you remember
the time in church

01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:51.285
where I was six,
and you kept telling me

01:00:51.318 --> 01:00:52.786
to tuck my shirt in,

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.088
and my shirt wouldn't stay in

01:00:54.121 --> 01:00:55.956
because it was
a little too short?

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.092
And you pulled me
over to the side,

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.793
and in front of everybody,

01:00:59.827 --> 01:01:01.228
you pulled my pants down,

01:01:01.262 --> 01:01:02.463
and pulled my shirt down,

01:01:02.496 --> 01:01:06.901
and then you pulled my pants,
like, almost up to my chest?

01:01:06.934 --> 01:01:07.801
Do you remember that?

01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:10.304
Yeah, did we get
your shirt tucked in?

01:01:16.744 --> 01:01:18.913
- I'm just gonna run and get...
- Mom?

01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:21.015
Mom, Mom, Mom, stop, please?

01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:22.983
Please put that down.

01:01:23.017 --> 01:01:24.084
Please put that down.

01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:25.152
You're just tryin' to clean up

01:01:25.186 --> 01:01:26.387
because you're
conflict avoidant,

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.155
and that's always
been your issue,

01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:29.790
and it's crippled you
as a human being.

01:01:29.823 --> 01:01:31.859
Conflict avoidant?
Well, I don't know about that.

01:01:31.892 --> 01:01:35.262
Please stop, please stop!

01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:38.032
I think you need to calm down,

01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:39.333
buster.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:41.769
- We're calm!
- We're,

01:01:41.802 --> 01:01:43.971
we are in a safe space.

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:46.173
- This is a safe space.
- This is a safe space

01:01:46.207 --> 01:01:49.109
- for us to just...
- This is not a safe place.

01:01:49.143 --> 01:01:51.011
This is a safe space

01:01:51.045 --> 01:01:53.214
- to talk about what's really...
- This is the most unsafe place

01:01:53.247 --> 01:01:55.382
I've ever been in my whole life.

01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:57.451
There is nothing
safe about this!

01:01:57.484 --> 01:01:59.186
This is a safe space!

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.955
What does that mean,
a safe space?

01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:02.122
It's not a safe place.

01:02:02.156 --> 01:02:04.258
There's no such thing
as a safe place!

01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:06.260
- What is a safe place?
- This is a family safe place

01:02:06.293 --> 01:02:08.762
to just say everything
you gotta say!

01:02:08.796 --> 01:02:11.031
Dad, I think you're petrified.

01:02:11.065 --> 01:02:12.900
I think you're
fucking petrified,

01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:14.835
and I just wanna
create a safe space

01:02:14.868 --> 01:02:16.036
to talk about why you're scared.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:20.908
I'm just frightened to death,
so how we gonna help me?

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:23.010
- What happened to you?
- When?

01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:25.012
When you were a kid?

01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:27.948
I got the shit beat outta me.

01:02:31.118 --> 01:02:32.820
I got hit with a fist,

01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:34.421
I got hit with a belt,

01:02:34.455 --> 01:02:36.223
I got hit with a stick.

01:02:36.257 --> 01:02:40.995
I got hit with
whatever was available.

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:43.931
You don't know real fear

01:02:43.964 --> 01:02:47.101
until you met my dad
when he was younger.

01:02:49.136 --> 01:02:52.239
He'd come home from a trip,
and I don't know where

01:02:52.273 --> 01:02:53.907
the rage was coming from,

01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:58.812
but this guy came
like a fucking lion

01:02:58.846 --> 01:03:01.181
out of nowhere!

01:03:01.215 --> 01:03:03.817
And he would beat
the shit out of me,

01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:08.222
and then he'd leave again
for three days.

01:03:08.255 --> 01:03:11.892
All I knew about
being a parent is

01:03:11.925 --> 01:03:14.128
how he parented me.

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:19.199
What else is there?

01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:26.473
Well, I, I, I gotta go.

01:03:26.508 --> 01:03:27.975
Dad, no you don't.

01:03:28.008 --> 01:03:30.844
Well, I gotta go soon.

01:03:30.878 --> 01:03:32.146
Real soon.

01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:34.114
I know we haven't,

01:03:34.148 --> 01:03:35.149
I haven't talked to you yet,

01:03:35.182 --> 01:03:39.053
but I do, I do need you to stay

01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:40.321
because...

01:03:40.354 --> 01:03:42.156
I don't wanna talk
about that other thing.

01:03:42.189 --> 01:03:44.992
Well, we are going
to talk about it

01:03:45.025 --> 01:03:47.394
because this is an open forum.

01:03:47.428 --> 01:03:49.531
It's open forum day.

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:53.200
And the whole
reason that I got

01:03:53.233 --> 01:03:56.970
sent up on this quest

01:03:57.004 --> 01:04:00.240
was because of your text.

01:04:00.274 --> 01:04:02.309
What text?

01:04:02.343 --> 01:04:04.546
Where you asked us
to pay your rent?

01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:05.547
Mm.

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:11.653
That's why we're here?

01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:15.089
I'm, I'm sorry I,

01:04:15.122 --> 01:04:16.591
I got backed up.

01:04:16.624 --> 01:04:18.425
I got behind.

01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:19.993
I got behind,

01:04:20.027 --> 01:04:22.963
and that's what family's for.

01:04:22.996 --> 01:04:24.932
Family's there
to help each other.

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:27.234
I helped you when
you were a little baby.

01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:29.370
Dad, the...

01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:31.338
Can we talk about the pills?

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:33.374
And the relapse?

01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:35.643
And the fact that
this is the fourth time

01:04:35.677 --> 01:04:37.211
in the last two years

01:04:37.244 --> 01:04:39.647
that you've hit us up for money?

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.650
I'm not a drug addict.

01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:46.220
I have a pain problem

01:04:46.253 --> 01:04:47.354
with my back.

01:04:47.388 --> 01:04:49.591
Had an accident many years ago,

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:52.292
and sometimes it's
hard to maintain

01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:55.963
the right, you know, balance.

01:04:55.996 --> 01:04:57.030
But, Dad...

01:04:57.064 --> 01:05:00.134
I needed the money
'cause I needed the money!

01:05:00.167 --> 01:05:02.403
And I don't appreciate
you bringing it up.

01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:06.373
- How many pills are you taking?
- I take it as prescribed.

01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:08.475
What is prescribed?

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:12.146
I don't know.

01:05:12.179 --> 01:05:14.047
I'm sorry, just kill me, okay?

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:14.948
Just fucking kill me?

01:05:14.982 --> 01:05:17.050
Why don't I just
fucking kill myself?

01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:18.520
Then it'd be over, then you
wouldn't have to... You could

01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:20.254
- raise your kid by yourself.
- Whoa!

01:05:20.287 --> 01:05:22.022
- Okay, Bob...
- I don't give a fuck!

01:05:22.055 --> 01:05:22.956
- Dad!
- Do you understand how

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.991
narcissistic you're being

01:05:24.024 --> 01:05:25.560
- right now?
- Narcissistic.

01:05:25.593 --> 01:05:27.629
- Fuck you!
- Yeah!

01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:30.197
Yeah, I mean,
we drive down here

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.399
five hours to come here,

01:05:32.433 --> 01:05:33.701
and take you out,

01:05:33.735 --> 01:05:36.336
and have a great
time to celebrate

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.405
the birth of our grandkid,

01:05:38.439 --> 01:05:41.709
and you, you wanna have
an inquisition with us

01:05:41.743 --> 01:05:44.746
about the parents that we were

01:05:44.779 --> 01:05:46.581
years and years ago,

01:05:46.614 --> 01:05:48.282
when we didn't know any better?

01:05:48.315 --> 01:05:50.217
We didn't have these
parenting classes,

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:54.522
this RIE, RIE parenting classes,
whatever the heck

01:05:54.556 --> 01:05:55.590
it was you went to...
You don't understand

01:05:55.623 --> 01:05:58.025
- how different it was.
- I was out on the streets

01:05:58.058 --> 01:05:58.992
when I was a kid.

01:05:59.026 --> 01:06:01.361
I was sellin' papers
on a paper corner,

01:06:01.395 --> 01:06:05.365
on a corner when
I was nine years old.

01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:07.569
- It's different!
- It's real different.

01:06:07.602 --> 01:06:09.236
I had to walk to school,

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:12.005
miles, when I was
seven years old!

01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:12.874
They would just put me out.

01:06:12.907 --> 01:06:14.274
I mean, anything
could have happened,

01:06:14.308 --> 01:06:15.375
and bad things did happen!

01:06:15.409 --> 01:06:18.680
Yeah, you can't teach
somebody to climb a tree.

01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:22.282
I fell out of a tree!

01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:24.619
That's right, you gotta
learn to climb the tree.

01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:26.487
Cut my ear, I still have a scar.

01:06:26.521 --> 01:06:28.222
Oh, I'll tell you
another thing that happened.

01:06:28.255 --> 01:06:30.692
They would give me a dog,
my mother would give me a dog.

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:33.193
I'd fall in love with the dog,
I'd have the dog for six months,

01:06:33.227 --> 01:06:35.797
then Daddy would come home,
and give the dog away!

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:38.600
On Christmas Eve, once,
I had a dog named Stray.

01:06:38.633 --> 01:06:40.200
They gave the dog away
on Christmas Eve,

01:06:40.234 --> 01:06:41.636
and my mother said, "Oh,

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:43.738
it's a good time to
give the dog to the pound

01:06:43.771 --> 01:06:46.106
because on Christmas,
people will be goin' to get

01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:47.407
dogs for their children."

01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:49.544
You wonder why I didn't want
you to have a dog growin' up?

01:06:49.577 --> 01:06:52.145
- I couldn't bear it!
- It's a different world

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:53.615
that you're living in

01:06:53.648 --> 01:06:56.450
from the world we
lived in and grew up in.

01:06:56.483 --> 01:06:59.621
And you really don't know
what it was like.

01:06:59.654 --> 01:07:01.523
And feelings, I mean,
it's a luxury,

01:07:01.556 --> 01:07:03.257
it's a privilege
to have feelings,

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:04.458
to be able to discuss feelings.

01:07:04.491 --> 01:07:08.228
If I would have stopped to
talk to my dad about feelings,

01:07:08.262 --> 01:07:09.764
he woulda knocked me for a loop!

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.533
I didn't even know
I had feelings.

01:07:11.566 --> 01:07:15.068
- What are feelings, man?
- Feelings.

01:07:15.102 --> 01:07:17.271
Good luck!

01:07:17.304 --> 01:07:19.206
Is that what you want,
is you want, you want,

01:07:19.239 --> 01:07:22.442
you guys want,
you want an apology?

01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:24.278
I'll apologize to you.

01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:27.347
I'll look right into
your eyes right now,

01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:29.551
and I am so sorry

01:07:29.584 --> 01:07:31.786
for all the times
that I ever hurt you,

01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:34.321
and all the times that I ever

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:36.089
made you upset,

01:07:36.123 --> 01:07:37.157
and all the times...

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:38.660
I'll apologize for him too.

01:07:38.693 --> 01:07:39.561
I hated it when he

01:07:39.594 --> 01:07:41.461
- threatened you.
- Is that what you want?

01:07:41.495 --> 01:07:43.263
For us to tell you we're sorry?

01:07:43.297 --> 01:07:45.867
- Tell him! Apologize to him.
- I mean, okay, I'm sorry

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.267
if I hurt you.

01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:48.068
I'm sorry.

01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:49.771
But say it,
say it like you mean it.

01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:52.707
I am sorry if I hurt you.

01:07:56.744 --> 01:07:58.846
See?

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.716
He is sorry.

01:08:01.749 --> 01:08:03.450
This is a good man,

01:08:03.483 --> 01:08:05.385
and he loves you.

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:10.825
You doin' okay, Dad?

01:08:15.462 --> 01:08:16.831
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:22.301
Dad, Dad, look at me.

01:08:22.336 --> 01:08:25.138
How many pills are you at?

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:26.506
How many?

01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:33.881
I don't know!

01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.550
I don't know.

01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:36.718
Dad.

01:08:38.653 --> 01:08:40.755
I don't know!

01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:44.191
I take 'em, I take 'em,
I just, it doesn't...

01:08:44.224 --> 01:08:46.393
I take 'em as needed!

01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:48.428
And I need a lot.

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:50.564
I need a lot.

01:08:55.202 --> 01:08:56.671
Will you go to rehab?

01:09:04.511 --> 01:09:06.814
Okay.

01:09:06.848 --> 01:09:08.816
Yeah?

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.451
Yeah.

01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:14.354
I'll go to the meetings,
I'll do whatever I can.

01:09:14.388 --> 01:09:15.389
I'll do anything!

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:17.591
I'm gonna throw these
freakin' pills away.

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:19.594
Here! Take 'em,

01:09:19.627 --> 01:09:21.895
and flush 'em away.

01:09:21.929 --> 01:09:24.363
This is it, this is
day one... day zero.

01:09:24.398 --> 01:09:26.868
Tomorrow's day one.

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:29.604
Dad.

01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:32.238
If you mean it,

01:09:32.272 --> 01:09:34.307
it would really
mean a lot to me.

01:09:37.545 --> 01:09:38.880
I mean it!

01:09:41.549 --> 01:09:43.651
But I don't know.

01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:50.390
But I wanna see your baby.

01:09:56.363 --> 01:09:59.634
I'm excited for you
to be a grandpa.

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:04.304
I don't wanna miss that!

01:10:04.337 --> 01:10:07.374
I don't want you to miss that.

01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:10.377
We don't want
you guys to miss it.

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.279
That's why we wanted to

01:10:12.312 --> 01:10:14.649
talk to you because
it's important to us

01:10:14.682 --> 01:10:17.852
that you're in our kid's life.

01:10:42.844 --> 01:10:44.779
Oh, that's weird.

01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:46.313
Ooh!

01:10:49.517 --> 01:10:52.019
Oh, my God, I have
to go to the bathroom.

01:10:52.053 --> 01:10:53.654
You okay?

01:10:53.688 --> 01:10:55.757
Ooh, I gotta go.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:58.025
Uh, okay.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.029
I'll be right back.

01:11:49.877 --> 01:11:51.846
Uh, honey?

01:11:51.879 --> 01:11:53.346
Can you come up here?

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.849
I'll be right back.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.055
Wow.

01:12:01.088 --> 01:12:03.658
What the fuck was that?

01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:05.293
I don't know.

01:12:08.696 --> 01:12:10.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:12.834
You okay?

01:12:12.867 --> 01:12:14.434
It's starting.

01:12:14.467 --> 01:12:15.970
It's star...

01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:19.472
Oh, like, it's
starting right now?

01:12:19.507 --> 01:12:22.844
Yeah, right now.

01:12:22.877 --> 01:12:25.613
Okay.

01:12:25.646 --> 01:12:26.948
Okay.

01:12:29.617 --> 01:12:30.952
Awesome!

01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:35.790
Awesome.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.127
Oh!

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:19.567
Are you okay?

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.601
- No.
- Are you okay?

01:13:20.635 --> 01:13:23.638
I'm really stressed,
and I'm really tired.

01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:24.739
Oh, okay.

01:13:24.772 --> 01:13:25.873
My white blood cell count

01:13:25.907 --> 01:13:27.208
- is not doing well.
- No, I know.

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:28.408
You need to not stress out.

01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:31.112
- I can't be stressed out!
- You need to not stress out.

01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:32.947
I know I need to not stress out!

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.717
- Just, so just calm down!
- So I know, so you...

01:13:41.923 --> 01:13:44.659
Okay, let's try it again.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.579
Wait a second, 'cause we can
figure this out mathematically.

01:14:05.613 --> 01:14:08.883
- Let's go that way.
- The city lights are there.

01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:10.851
The moon is there.

01:14:10.885 --> 01:14:12.887
Do you remember
where our car was

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.588
in relation to the moon?

01:14:17.992 --> 01:14:20.795
Do you remember
where our car was...

01:14:20.828 --> 01:14:22.663
I peed my pants.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.868
Hey, stop.

01:14:40.648 --> 01:14:42.283
Eighty-eight,
eighty-nine,

01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:44.785
ninety, ninety-one,
ninety-two,

01:14:44.819 --> 01:14:47.288
ninety-three,
ninety-four, ninety-five,

01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:49.056
ninety-six, ninety-seven,

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:50.992
ninety-eight, ninety-nine.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.861
That's good, hold up.

01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:28.295
Hold on, just like that.

01:15:28.329 --> 01:15:30.564
- Hold on just like...
- Don't take a picture!

01:15:30.598 --> 01:15:31.432
We don't need a picture,

01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:32.867
- this is for us!
- Let me take a picture!

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.201
No, that goes to the cloud.

01:15:34.235 --> 01:15:35.302
I'm about to let you fuck me.

01:15:35.336 --> 01:15:37.671
- Let me take a picture.
- Yeah, this is different.

01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:38.572
It's not on the cloud.

01:15:38.606 --> 01:15:40.775
- You swear your phone?
- I swear to God

01:15:40.808 --> 01:15:41.709
it's not on the cloud.

01:15:41.742 --> 01:15:44.912
'Cause this is not
for social media.
