Previously on The O.C.:

00:02.402 --> 00:05.064
Is articulating feelings to your girlfriend
a challenge?

00:05.238 --> 00:06.796
-And how do you feel?
-l....

00:06.973 --> 00:09.032
I see the great love of your life.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.733
-It's George.
-George?

00:10.910 --> 00:13.071
-I'm here to offer you a job.
-He heard about my work with sea otters...

00:13.246 --> 00:17.205
...invited me to travel across the country
and talk to college kids about voting.

00:17.384 --> 00:20.148
Call Jason Spitz.
You're always saying how funny he is.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.016
-I don't have that many guy friends.
-Who's got the time?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.417
Where the heck's your mom?

00:24.591 --> 00:26.957
I know I asked you to be my stepdad...

00:27.127 --> 00:29.391
...but do you mind
being my friend instead?

00:29.562 --> 00:34.693
-Tell me what it is that you love about Julie.
-We're just from the same world.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.561
I'm not buying you lingerie
for your birthday.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.428
That's fine. I told you,
you don't have to buy me anything.

01:08.601 --> 01:11.069
You and Ryan are throwing me
a party, that's enough.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.501
You've never had a party,
let alone been to one...

01:13.673 --> 01:15.766
...but people get presents
for their birthday.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.705
Will you please tell me
what you want?

01:17.877 --> 01:19.208
Okay, honestly?

01:19.379 --> 01:22.143
I want Ryan to ask me
to go to Berkeley with him next year.

01:22.315 --> 01:26.251
-I was thinking along the lines of a cute top.
-I know. It's just that I'm a planner.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.752
I'm seeing that day 6 months in the future
when we go our separate ways.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.084
And I just know
that if Ryan goes to Berkeley...

01:32.258 --> 01:35.785
...and I go to Harvard or Princeton
or Oxford, then it's over.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.988
Don't you have to apply to Berkeley first
in order to--?

01:39.699 --> 01:43.465
-You applied to Berkeley? Does Ryan know?
-No, I applied before we started dating.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.230
I just got back from France,
and I had to go somewhere.

01:46.406 --> 01:50.740
So I reapplied to Princeton, Oxford, Yale,
Harvard and the Sorbonne.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.105
And I figured,
why not throw Berkeley in?

01:55.415 --> 01:57.883
-Hi. Could we get two coffees, please?
-Yeah.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.384
So you wanna get Ryan to tell you
that he wants you to go to Berkeley...

02:01.554 --> 02:03.784
-...without knowing you already got in?
-Exactly.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.484
-How you gonna do that?
-Easy. Get him to tell me that he loves me.

02:07.660 --> 02:11.026
Ryan talking about his feelings.
That would be an earth-shattering event.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.096
Careful, they're hot.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.097
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.469
You see this,
about earthquake weather?

02:21.641 --> 02:26.101
It's exactly this kind of voodoo science
that lets politicians deny global warming.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.873
Oh, my God, I know.
How many times have they predicted...

02:29.048 --> 02:30.913
..."the big one" and it never happens?

02:31.484 --> 02:33.281
It almost makes you wish that it would.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.592
Hey.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.700
-Good morning.
-What's the occasion?

03:21.868 --> 03:25.770
You're being so sweet throwing me a party
and I wanted to thank you, so--

03:25.939 --> 03:29.340
-Did I ever tell you about how--?
-How you've never had a birthday party?

03:29.509 --> 03:32.034
And you've spent every birthday
alone in your room...

03:32.212 --> 03:36.114
...watching Sixteen Candles and talking
to a gypsy on the psychic hotline?

03:36.516 --> 03:39.178
Yeah, I know, I'm a broken record.
It just--

03:39.352 --> 03:42.014
It really means a lot to me
that you're doing this for me.

03:42.188 --> 03:45.123
Taylor, I'll tell you,
planning your birthday party is not easy.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.690
I expect something in return.

03:48.661 --> 03:50.458
I expect to have my way with you.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.426
-Ryan.
-Well, all the time and energy...

03:55.602 --> 03:57.069
...clowns, balloons, a magician.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.638
-Oh, well, if there's a magician....
-Yeah.

04:03.843 --> 04:07.040
It's kind of strange to think
about all of this ending, isn't it?

04:08.281 --> 04:09.543
You going off to Berkeley.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.276
Me, whichever way the wind blows.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.986
-Well, it's still six months away.
-Right. Yeah.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.815
If only I had a crystal ball, huh?

04:17.991 --> 04:21.119
Maybe I should call Esmeralda
from the psychic hotline.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.694
-This is a really good croissant.
-Don't you feel...

04:23.863 --> 04:27.458
...that we're on the cusp of something
and we just need to leap into the void?

04:27.634 --> 04:30.626
-Did you get these at Joe's?
-Ryan, don't you have that feeling?

04:31.738 --> 04:33.399
-What?
-That life is telling us...

04:33.573 --> 04:37.532
...to take a wild, impulsive jump
into the unknown?

04:39.345 --> 04:40.710
Not really.

04:41.648 --> 04:44.640
So you're good?
You don't have a need...

04:44.817 --> 04:49.083
...to just let something explode out of you,
consequences be damned?

04:50.123 --> 04:54.150
-What are we talking about?
-Well, I was....

04:54.994 --> 04:59.021
I guess it's just my birthday
and I'm getting sentimental.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.699
All right. Well, don't worry.
It's gonna be great, okay?

05:03.269 --> 05:06.500
All right. I gotta go. Thanks for this.

05:07.273 --> 05:10.174
Hey, tonight, you wanna do something?
See a movie?

05:10.877 --> 05:12.105
Yeah, sure. Okay.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.643
All right, great.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.303
All right.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.311
Oh, come on. Yes, you did.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.318
You know it.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.385
Oh, my God.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.188
Oh, hi, honey.
Sorry, I didn't hear you coming down.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.963
Look, Mom, do you mind?

05:32.131 --> 05:34.565
-I still have to eat in here.
-What can I get you?

05:34.734 --> 05:36.964
Want scrambled eggs?
Or I could whip up pancakes.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.366
You cook too? That's amazing.

05:39.539 --> 05:40.904
Oh, it's just a talent I have.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.439
Yeah, one of many.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.708
-I'm seriously never gonna stop barfing.
-Kaitlin, don't be gross.

05:46.879 --> 05:52.875
Me, gross? What's gross is Frank's dirty,
germy convict bag sitting on the counter.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.612
Did the warden give that to you
as a going-away present?

05:55.788 --> 05:57.449
-Kaitlin--
-It's okay. It's okay.

05:57.623 --> 05:59.215
It shouldn't be on the counter.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.388
Though I actually got it at REl.

06:02.562 --> 06:05.087
Well, why bother with a bag?
You can just move in.

06:05.264 --> 06:08.199
-You spend enough time here anyway.
-Young lady, apologize.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.598
I'm sorry, Frank.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.763
Feel free to have as many conjugal visits
as you'd like.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.568
You know, I should get going.
I've got a job interview.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.474
-I'll walk you out.
-Okay.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.881
And we'll talk later.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.525
-Nice to see you.
-You too.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.406
Mrs. Cohen?

06:48.741 --> 06:50.140
Holly.

06:50.309 --> 06:51.799
I went to Harbor with Seth.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.343
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.980
Are you here for prenatal yoga?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.638
Yes, I am. And you?

06:56.983 --> 06:59.349
Yes, I just found out.
How far along are you?

06:59.519 --> 07:02.488
-Not very. I just found out too.
-Well, this class is great.

07:02.655 --> 07:05.920
I told Missy, the instructor,
I've worked way too hard for this body...

07:06.092 --> 07:08.492
...to just let it turn
into some dumpy baby factory.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.152
I mean, who says I can't have a baby
and a six-pack?

07:11.998 --> 07:15.058
-I should probably stretch before class.
-Hold on just a second.

07:15.234 --> 07:17.259
Hey, ho's, come here.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.273
This is Mrs. Cohen,
she just found out she's pregnant.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.672
-Oh, my God!
-Congratulations!

07:24.844 --> 07:26.675
And you're not even showing.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.241
So should we let her in?

07:29.415 --> 07:31.349
-Oh, yeah.
-Totally. She's ripped.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.812
We formed a club.

07:32.985 --> 07:37.479
Promised ourselves we wouldn't turn out
like Molly the Mammoth over there.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.526
In nine months, I'm wearing my bikini.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.058
I don't care what anyone says.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.992
I told Jerry if I get too big,
I'm inducing at eight months.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.697
It's easier to lose the weight.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.334
Do you want in?
We call ourselves the Six-Pack Pack.

07:49.502 --> 07:52.528
Isn't that, like, so cute?
Don't you just wanna barf?

07:53.773 --> 07:55.468
All the time.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.719
-Summer, what's up?
-Hey.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.151
I am just picking up Seth.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.848
Taking him to an art exhibition
sponsored by GEORGE:

08:13.025 --> 08:15.994
Global Environmental Organization
Regarding Greenhouse Emissions.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.991
-Seth's going to an art show?
-He's going to art school.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.998
I like the environment,
so I thought it was the perfect date.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.658
Sure.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.905
-So are you ready for Taylor's party?
-Oh, yeah. Party's all set.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.872
-Even got her a present.
-Really? Mind telling me what it is?

08:31.043 --> 08:34.011
Well, you know how she likes
translating those French love poems?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.205
I collected a few,
had them bound for her.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.373
Atwood, that is so romantic.

08:40.186 --> 08:44.246
Well, nothing's as romantic as the first time
you tell someone you love them, though.

08:47.326 --> 08:52.821
I haven't told Taylor I love her.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.899
-You haven't?
-Has she said something?

08:55.067 --> 08:58.935
No, no. I just assumed.
You guys have been together for a while...

08:59.105 --> 09:03.041
...and you seem pretty happy and thought,
"Why wouldn't you have said, 'l love you'? "

09:03.209 --> 09:05.541
-I have an idea. Why don't you?
-What?

09:05.711 --> 09:09.579
For her birthday. You should,
because the book of poems is awesome...

09:09.749 --> 09:12.183
...but add that special little "l love you."

09:12.351 --> 09:15.514
As a girl, I don't know,
me personally, I got chills.

09:16.856 --> 09:20.223
Does Taylor expect me to tell her
that I love her on her birthday?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.987
What? No. I don't know. I gotta go.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.093
I can't stay, okay?

09:32.271 --> 09:33.602
Well, thanks for meeting me.

09:33.773 --> 09:37.368
-I wanted to talk to you alone.
-You won't do anything pervy, will you?

09:37.610 --> 09:40.670
Kaitlin, I care about your mom.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.610
And considering my past,
I understand why you're suspicious.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.944
I really don't care
that you went to prison.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.417
I mean, the Bullit went to prison
and he was awesome.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.047
You're just boring.

09:51.557 --> 09:55.755
-I'm sorry, but it's just the way it is.
-Well, I have to say, I don't think that's fair.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.055
-You hardly know me.
-Then say something funny.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.656
-What?
-Make me laugh.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.229
Fine.

10:07.006 --> 10:10.601
I don't know
what interests a 1 5-year-old girl...

10:11.043 --> 10:13.876
...but your mother doesn't think
I'm boring.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.139
Well, that's because
you're sleeping with her.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.909
-Can you not say that?
-What do you want me to say?

10:19.085 --> 10:22.851
Is it true in prison on your first day,
you gotta make someone your bitch?

10:23.022 --> 10:25.616
What about the dropping-the-soap thing?
I mean, really...

10:25.791 --> 10:28.692
...why don't you guys
just install soap dispensers?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.930
Hey, I make your mom happy.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.831
I'm just asking for a chance here, Kaitlin.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.800
Of course.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.131
If it makes my mom happy.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.453
Oh, my God.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.290
Oh, my God.

11:09.902 --> 11:13.133
It's so beautiful. You forget
how the ocean ties us all together.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.967
He's right. If we aren't
good custodians for our planet...

11:16.142 --> 11:18.736
...what right do we have to be here?
Wasn't that amazing?

11:18.911 --> 11:20.344
-I'd give it a three.
-A three?

11:20.513 --> 11:23.277
He put a transmitter in some trash,
threw it in the ocean...

11:23.449 --> 11:26.577
...followed it for six years
all to show how pollution travels.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.982
-You give it a three?
-A three and a half, then.

11:29.155 --> 11:33.785
And when he followed it through the oil fires
in the Persian Gulf and burned his arm?

11:33.959 --> 11:37.258
I know, but the camerawork was terrible.
What film stock was he using?

11:37.430 --> 11:41.059
-The oranges and reds totally bled together.
-He was just trying to show...

11:41.233 --> 11:44.430
-...the health of our planet.
-He's also making a movie. As a movie...

11:44.603 --> 11:46.901
-...it sucks.
-Well, what about that one?

11:47.073 --> 11:50.372
Where the turtle adopted the hippo
who was lost in the tsunami?

11:50.543 --> 11:54.570
Well, it's pretty much
the nature film equivalent of a chick flick.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.315
Okay. What about that?

11:57.483 --> 11:59.883
Where the family of giraffes' habitat
was destroyed?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.542
Yeah, shot like a perfume ad.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.657
God, what is your problem, Seth?
I want you to get excited about something.

12:05.825 --> 12:10.592
I am, about things that are good.
I could do one of these with my hands tied.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.731
Really? Prove it.

12:13.132 --> 12:14.895
-What?
-Make a movie.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.635
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I wanna see you do it better.

12:18.437 --> 12:21.736
I wanna go watch the penguins again
and don't you dare say anything.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.704
Hey, I didn't know you were coming by.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.213
I was just at Spitzy's office.
You should have called.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.786
-Everything all right?
-People in Newport are awful.

12:36.956 --> 12:39.754
You're late to the party.
I've been saying that for 20 years.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.153
Well, has it gotten worse?

12:41.327 --> 12:43.727
I know Julie
and some of the others are bad, but--

12:43.896 --> 12:46.387
-What happened?
-I was at this prenatal yoga class.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.260
These young women, they're monsters.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.834
-They wanted me to join the Six-Pack Pack.
-The what?

12:51.003 --> 12:54.063
And inducing labor at 8 months
so they don't have to gain weight.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.835
-Can we raise another child around this?
-Newport's always had that element...

12:58.010 --> 13:01.036
...and still we managed to have a life.
Not everybody's like that.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.773
You know, Spitz has been wanting us
to meet his wife.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.619
How about we do dinner tomorrow?
Restore your faith in humanity.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.316
-All right.
-But more importantly...

13:11.490 --> 13:13.958
...do you think they'll let me join
the Six-Pack Pack?

13:14.126 --> 13:17.425
I've been doing sit-ups. Hit me
with your best shot. Come on, wind up.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.889
I'm not a beast.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.092
Oh, God. He really loves her.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.631
And she's never gonna know how he feels,
because he can't tell her.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.638
-lsn't that tragic?
-Yup.

13:30.442 --> 13:31.807
I mean, how could you do that?

13:31.977 --> 13:34.605
How could you just let
the love of your life slip away...

13:34.780 --> 13:37.715
...because you were too afraid to tell them
how you really felt?

13:37.883 --> 13:39.510
Well, maybe she's better off.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.188
You get that from when
she was about to be burned at the stake?

13:44.557 --> 13:47.617
No, she's beautiful,
he's a hunchback who lives in a bell tower.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.626
-The chances of it working out--
-But he doesn't know that.

13:50.796 --> 13:54.027
If he told her how he felt, maybe
there'd be a way to work things out.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.863
They could have a life together.
Or, you know, at least four more years.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.871
Why did you save me?

14:02.041 --> 14:05.135
-But the archbishop--
-I am not talking about the movie. It's--

14:05.411 --> 14:11.008
There're just moments in everyone's life,
and if you just let them slip away, then--

14:11.183 --> 14:12.878
Then they're gone forever.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.350
I mean, that's the tragic thing about life.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.114
Don't you feel that way?

14:21.594 --> 14:23.425
-Taylor....
-Yeah.

14:24.496 --> 14:25.929
I....

14:33.205 --> 14:34.832
Missed the last part of the movie.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.941
Would you mind rewinding it a little?

14:41.113 --> 14:42.603
Sure.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.343
Thanks.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.918
You're lonely, huh?

14:49.221 --> 14:50.848
Better get used to it, buddy.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.926
-Good morning.
-lf you say so.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.436
What's that?

15:07.606 --> 15:10.837
This is the obituary
for mine and Ryan's relationship.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.706
-A rose plucked before its time.
-English?

15:14.013 --> 15:16.277
I wrote a letter
to the dean of Berkeley saying...

15:16.448 --> 15:20.111
...I must decline the scholarship
and he should offer it to the next candidate.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.618
So you're saying no?
But what happened with Ryan?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.785
I tried, Summer. I really did.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.723
The moment was upon us.

15:27.893 --> 15:31.795
We were staring
into each other's eyes, and....

15:32.331 --> 15:33.889
And he just didn't say it.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.466
Sometimes, I wanna grab him
and tie him to a chair...

15:36.635 --> 15:39.661
...and shoot him full of sodium pentothal
and see what spills out.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.329
-Why don't you?
-You don't think it's too crazy?

15:42.508 --> 15:45.341
Because I was thinking if we tackled him,
then tie him down--

15:45.511 --> 15:47.570
But I wasn't talking literally.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.578
Do you love him?

15:50.716 --> 15:53.844
-Yeah, I really do.
-Do you think he loves you?

15:54.019 --> 15:57.045
Well, sometimes he grabs my hand
and he squeezes it for no reason.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.213
-I mean, what else could that mean?
-Okay.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.518
So we just need
to loosen his tongue a little.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.389
But how are we gonna--?

16:04.163 --> 16:07.621
-Summer Roberts, you bad thing.
-Okay, you know what?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.633
A trip to the Roberts' wine cellar
is in order.

16:19.011 --> 16:20.911
What the hell is he doing?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.308
-Morning.
-Morning.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.848
-Hey, you all right?
-Yeah, it's just a cramp.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.316
How far did you go?

16:30.489 --> 16:33.219
-Nine, 1 0 miles.
-Wouldn't it be easier if you just said:

16:33.392 --> 16:36.122
"There's something bothering me.
Can you give me advice? "

16:36.295 --> 16:39.753
-Yes, it would, but where's the fun in that?
-Let me guess.

16:39.932 --> 16:43.629
You're trying to decide if you love Taylor
so you can tell her on her birthday.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.539
You've been dating a while,
things are good, birthday's tomorrow.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.640
-Bingo.
-Yeah, you're good.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.332
So do you love her?

16:52.644 --> 16:54.544
Honestly, I'm scared.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.407
-Good, you should be.
-Well, that's reassuring.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.347
It might be the most powerful thing
you can say to a person.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.079
Changes everything. For heaven's sake,
if you don't feel it, don't say it.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.917
It's just, I think she's expecting it.
And to not say it--

17:07.092 --> 17:09.219
-It's like saying you don't love her.
-Exactly.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.425
-Well, do you care about her?
-Of course.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.189
Do you enjoy being with her?

17:13.365 --> 17:16.060
-More than with anyone.
-Tell her that.

17:16.234 --> 17:19.227
It won't be exactly what she wants to hear,
but it'll be honest.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.367
-All right.
-Can you tell me something?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.107
-Sure.
-Do you have any idea...

17:23.842 --> 17:25.309
...why Seth is filming the pool?

17:32.618 --> 17:36.110
Hey, check it out. Summer challenged me
to make this pretentious art film...

17:36.288 --> 17:38.654
...so I'm making one called
Six Hours in the Pool.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.849
-Sounds great.
-I'll tell you about it later.

17:41.026 --> 17:43.426
Taylor called, she wants you
to go there for dinner.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.423
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, okay.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.298
Oh, it's perfect.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.641
Look, Frank, I get that men have urges.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.041
I imagine prison is one of those places
where those urges get twisted.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.340
-Julie--
-I've never even heard of clown porn.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.847
The photo where they're stuffed
in the little car--

18:06.018 --> 18:07.815
-It's not mine.
-Oh, really?

18:07.986 --> 18:10.750
It was just in your bag along with this?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.788
Which one of us
is supposed to wear this?

18:12.958 --> 18:15.859
-Julie, none of this is mine.
-So someone went into your bag...

18:16.028 --> 18:19.486
...planted a wig and some
really bad clown porn. Who would--?

18:19.665 --> 18:22.498
-Oh, Kaitlin.
-Julie, it's all right.

18:22.668 --> 18:26.798
No, Frank, it's not. My daughter is trying
to sabotage this relationship.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.167
And where would she get her hands
on clown porn?

18:29.341 --> 18:30.865
Look, she's just hazing me.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.479
You know, it'll be good for me to show her
that I can take it.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.479
Look, it'll blow over. It's not serious.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.513
Did you see page 50?

18:45.057 --> 18:48.993
-How much more of this is there?
-Five hours and 58 minutes.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.890
What are you doing?

18:51.063 --> 18:53.327
I'm not gonna sit
and watch six hours of the pool.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.525
I told you to engage in something.
Instead, you set up a tripod.

18:56.702 --> 19:00.103
It's a satire.
It's a comment on the lack of artistic rigor--

19:00.272 --> 19:03.799
No, it's you being lazy. How many naps
did you take while you made this?

19:03.976 --> 19:08.379
I took two to re-- Do you feel
like you're overreacting a little bit?

19:08.547 --> 19:11.277
-What does it really matter?
-That's the problem, Seth.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.214
You did this because
you chose the path of least resistance.

19:14.386 --> 19:17.184
You could have made a movie about
anything, and you chose this.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.382
What am I supposed to do?
Follow Ryan until he punches someone?

19:20.559 --> 19:23.050
Yes. Anything that engages you
in the world.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.556
But what is the point?

19:25.731 --> 19:28.131
Well, if nothing else,
it's important to me.

19:36.642 --> 19:37.904
-I'll get your car.
-Thanks.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.670
-Mr. and Mrs. Cohen, go in.
-Thanks.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.080
-Sandy.
-Mr. Spitz.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.808
-How are you? Kirsten, how's it going?
-Hello, Jason.

19:45.984 --> 19:47.975
Listen, I want you to meet my wife.
Come on.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.951
-Sure.
-No way. Really?

19:51.123 --> 19:53.250
-Well, then what did she say?
-Honey, honey.

19:53.425 --> 19:56.019
Oh, my God. What a complete ho-bag.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.727
Honey, come on.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.863
I gotta go. Call me back.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.003
Love you, bitch.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.003
Hi. I am so sorry.

20:08.173 --> 20:11.336
Kirsten and Sandy Cohen,
this is Carrie, my wife.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.603
-It's so nice to meet you.
-You too.

20:13.779 --> 20:17.510
That was my girlfriend. She's having trouble
dating this guy and his wife's like:

20:17.683 --> 20:19.173
"I'll kill you."

20:20.552 --> 20:22.952
Wow, I imagine
that could be a little hard to handle.

20:23.121 --> 20:24.850
Oh, whatever. Not my problem.

20:25.757 --> 20:27.281
So, Carrie, you're from Newport?

20:27.459 --> 20:29.051
Oh, yeah. Born and bred.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.892
Really? Interesting.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.828
Oh, now, Sandy, let's get to it.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.959
How can we convince Jason here to get out
of that soup kitchen he calls an office...

20:39.137 --> 20:40.263
...and get a real job?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.901
Oh, thanks, that's good.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.779
Just for luck.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.448
Actually, Taylor,
I'm not that big a wine drinker.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.248
I know, but you can't have coq au vin
without the vin.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.550
Well, that's true.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.518
Okay.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.057
I feel bad, you making dinner
the day before your birthday.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.199
No, it's my pleasure. Absolutely.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.198
-Oh, sorry.
-It's okay.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.235
I'm nervous
because I've never cooked for you before.

21:13.405 --> 21:14.736
Okay, cheers.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.802
Oh, yeah.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.205
Bottoms up.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.672
-Tasty.
-So, look, Tay-- Oh, that's....

21:26.418 --> 21:29.285
So, Taylor, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.854
Let's save the serious conversation
for after dinner.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.151
We don't want it to get cold.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.754
-Okay.
-I think I need another sip.

21:39.097 --> 21:42.498
Wow, do you detect a hint
of blackberries?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.632
No, I don't.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.034
Try it. It's fun, come on.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.109
Okay.

21:55.681 --> 21:59.082
-No. Still no blackberries.
-I think you need to take a bigger sip.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.446
You still go to your sorority rush?

22:02.921 --> 22:06.379
Sandy, sisterhood doesn't just end
with graduation.

22:06.558 --> 22:09.584
A Tri-Delt once, a Tri-Delt forever.

22:09.761 --> 22:12.696
Oh, but last year, I got so sick.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.128
-Totally embarrassing.
-I can only imagine.

22:15.300 --> 22:19.134
And I thought, "Carrie, what gives?
Can't you hold your liquor anymore? "

22:19.504 --> 22:22.200
Then I realized
it was just morning sickness.

22:22.374 --> 22:26.538
-Was that a relief?
-I'm afraid it's getting a little late for us.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.942
Oh, no, no, no.
You are not running away.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.639
This great bar just opened up on Ocean.

22:31.817 --> 22:34.183
When was the last time
you two did tequila poppers?

22:34.353 --> 22:37.516
-Maybe another time.
-You're not bailing because you're pregnant.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.384
No offense, but that is lame.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.458
-Carrie, no--
-What? It's lame.

22:43.228 --> 22:46.823
-Actually, I'm an alcoholic.
-Oh, God.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.295
Me too.

22:49.134 --> 22:52.467
Hey, after you have that thing,
we should totally go out.

22:52.637 --> 22:54.832
You know, without the two dishrags.

22:55.006 --> 22:58.669
Oh, God, can you just take that thing
outside?

23:01.680 --> 23:04.581
Oh, don't freak.
I'm not a psycho. It's our baby.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.980
When we go out with the baby,
Carrie likes the nurse to sit nearby...

23:08.153 --> 23:09.450
...a few tables away.

23:09.621 --> 23:12.681
Oh, you know, Sandy, I'm suddenly--
I'm not feeling well.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.553
I better get you home.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.752
Thank you both
for an unforgettable evening.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.453
Jason, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

23:19.631 --> 23:20.859
-Yeah.
-Well, good night.

23:21.032 --> 23:24.934
Hey, Kirsten, remember,
you can call me for baby advice any time.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.196
Sure.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.632
Losers.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.377
I don't understand how you're not drunk.

23:34.546 --> 23:35.911
Oh, it's the Atwood genes.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.744
We're built to withstand
massive quantities of alcohol.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.788
Here we go. Here's the bed. Okay.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.550
All right. Now we're just gonna--
That's good.

23:47.726 --> 23:50.661
But if I can't get you drunk,
you'll never tell me you love me.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.126
Oh, Taylor.

23:52.297 --> 23:56.495
I know, I know, bad Taylor.
I shouldn't have tried to get you drunk.

23:56.668 --> 23:59.762
Just like I shouldn't have pretended
to be your sleep therapist...

23:59.938 --> 24:01.838
...or rented Roger the homosexual...

24:02.007 --> 24:05.465
...or stalked you
wearing a groundhog costume, or....

24:06.111 --> 24:08.807
-What else did I do?
-I think that's it.

24:09.681 --> 24:12.912
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

24:13.084 --> 24:16.520
Goodbye, Ryan, it was nice.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.155
Taylor?

24:20.225 --> 24:23.854
Taylor,
are you pretending to go to sleep...

24:24.029 --> 24:27.055
...thinking I'll tell you I love you
while you're unconscious?

24:27.365 --> 24:28.354
Maybe.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.128
-Don't laugh at me.
-I'm not. No, I'm not.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.170
It's hard dating someone
who doesn't tell you how they feel...

24:35.340 --> 24:38.537
...and always having to interpret
hand squeezes and--

24:38.710 --> 24:39.938
I love you.

24:41.713 --> 24:42.941
What?

24:43.882 --> 24:45.247
I love you.

24:46.718 --> 24:49.619
-You do?
-Yeah.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.791
I can't believe you just said it.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.490
Neither can l.

24:56.828 --> 25:00.320
-Oh, I love you too.
-Oh, good.

25:03.368 --> 25:06.394
-Now we can go to Berkeley together.
-What?

25:06.571 --> 25:09.540
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got into Berkeley.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.199
I applied and I got this letter...

25:12.744 --> 25:14.644
...and I put it on my desk, and....

25:14.813 --> 25:15.871
What?

25:32.898 --> 25:36.163
Ryan Atwood.
His face betrays no emotion...

25:36.334 --> 25:38.359
...but what passions lurk
behind those eyes?

25:38.537 --> 25:41.904
Answering that
is the purpose of this film.

25:42.073 --> 25:44.940
-Come with me.
-I thought the movie was about the pool.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.442
Summer didn't really take
to six hours of the pool.

25:47.612 --> 25:50.410
She wanted me to make a movie
in which I engage with people.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.312
What is Ryan Atwood wrapping
so intently?

25:53.485 --> 25:54.816
Taylor's birthday present.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.284
Taylor Townsend.

25:57.455 --> 26:01.118
The fast-talking Eve Harrington
who melted Ryan Atwood's heart.

26:01.426 --> 26:05.920
Tell us, Ryan, how does it feel
to have Dean Hess' sloppy seconds?

26:06.097 --> 26:08.691
Or what did you get her? Either one.

26:10.669 --> 26:14.662
Well, one of her hobbies
is translating French love poems...

26:14.839 --> 26:16.636
...so I had them bound for her.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.969
Wow, that is really romantic.

26:19.144 --> 26:20.441
It's not that romantic.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.513
Are you kidding?
You may as well tell her you love her.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.639
Well, it's--

26:25.817 --> 26:27.876
It's actually a little late for that.

26:28.486 --> 26:31.216
-What?
-Yeah.

26:31.656 --> 26:33.453
And then what happened?

26:34.626 --> 26:38.289
Well, we finished dinner
and he still wasn't drunk...

26:38.463 --> 26:41.057
...so I suggested a drinking game.

26:41.232 --> 26:43.962
I called it Drink.
Whenever I said, drink, we drank.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.626
-Simple but effective.
-Yeah, a little too effective.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.432
I ended up on the coffee table...

26:48.607 --> 26:52.202
...singing "Part of Your World"
and telling him he was my Prince Eric.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.810
Did he say it?

26:55.013 --> 26:56.605
-Yes.
-He did?

26:56.781 --> 26:59.841
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
Ryan told you he loved you.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.179
I know.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.619
I mean, I think he said it.

27:05.790 --> 27:10.159
This feeling just kind of came over me
and I couldn't stop myself.

27:10.328 --> 27:12.193
So why the long face? You regretting it?

27:12.364 --> 27:17.097
Well, turns out she applied to Berkeley
without telling me, and now--

27:17.268 --> 27:20.897
Your spur of the moment "l love you"
is committing you to four more years.

27:21.106 --> 27:22.130
The plot thickens.

27:22.307 --> 27:26.437
I'm not saying it'd be bad. It just seems
like all of a sudden we're going Mach 5.

27:26.611 --> 27:29.136
And you'd like to turn down
the heat a little.

27:29.614 --> 27:33.641
-He definitely said it. Absolutely.
-Here.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.718
-I think.
-Don't you think you'd remember?

27:35.887 --> 27:37.912
I don't know, it hurts.
What am I gonna do?

27:38.089 --> 27:41.991
I can't just ask him, "Hey, by the way,
did you tell me you loved me last night?

27:42.160 --> 27:44.128
Because I was too plastered
to remember."

27:44.295 --> 27:45.523
Right.

27:45.697 --> 27:48.461
Okay, today's your birthday, right?

27:48.633 --> 27:51.466
And I happen to know that he got you
a crazy romantic present.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.968
So when you open it,
why don't you just be like:

27:54.139 --> 27:57.939
"Oh, my gosh, Ryan, I love you"?
If he said it last night, he'll say it again.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.076
-You're a genius.
-Yes, I am. It's all up here.

28:01.946 --> 28:04.744
It's just there might be one other
tiny little thing.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.247
I'm not saying take it back.

28:06.418 --> 28:09.785
But today is her birthday,
so she'll be interpreting every little thing.

28:09.988 --> 28:12.013
So maybe you send her a message.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.320
For instance, that sends the message:
"You're the only girl in the world for me.

28:16.494 --> 28:20.123
Let's move to a co-op in Berkeley."
Is that what you wanna say?

28:20.932 --> 28:22.695
We go off Ryan Atwood.
What will he do?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.698
How will this situation resolve itself?

28:26.271 --> 28:28.535
-You said something about Berkeley?
-I'm not sure.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.335
Maybe I talked about him going there.
That makes sense.

28:31.509 --> 28:35.104
-Morning, girls. Happy birthday, Taylor.
-Thanks, Julie.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.510
I gave the mailman
that letter from the counter.

28:37.682 --> 28:40.549
What letter? The letter to Berkeley?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.313
-Yeah, I think so.
-Oh, my God.

28:43.488 --> 28:44.716
Oh, my God.

28:49.627 --> 28:51.618
Mr. Mail Carrier, sir.

28:51.796 --> 28:54.060
Excuse me, please, could you wait?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.460
Hi. I'm sorry.

28:55.633 --> 28:58.397
A woman in that house
where I live just gave you a letter...

28:58.570 --> 29:01.937
...that she shouldn't have
and I kind of need it back.

29:02.107 --> 29:06.635
Ma'am, once the letter goes in the pouch,
it's the property of the federal government.

29:06.811 --> 29:10.508
Okay, and I totally understand that.
But if you take that letter...

29:10.682 --> 29:14.140
...I'll lose my place at Berkeley
and a chance to be with the man I love...

29:14.319 --> 29:16.685
...who I think loves me.
And 1 5 years from now...

29:16.855 --> 29:18.948
...when he's trapped
in a loveless marriage...

29:19.124 --> 29:22.992
...and I've become a cold, hard ice queen
for whom love is but a distant memory...

29:23.161 --> 29:27.598
...it will come down to the fact that on
this day, which happens to be my birthday...

29:27.766 --> 29:32.465
...you obeyed the letter of the law
at the expense of simple human charity.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.070
-Wow, that was amazing.
-Can I have my letter now?

29:37.242 --> 29:39.107
Yeah, sure.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.606
-Hey.
-I didn't know you were a runner.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.810
Yeah, it helps me work stuff out.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.615
-You should try it.
-Maybe I will. Everything okay?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.849
Yeah. You know, I was just nearby.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.926
I figured I'd stop in and say hello...

29:57.095 --> 30:00.895
...ask your advice on winning
over a 1 5-year-old Newport girl.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.623
Kaitlin giving you trouble?

30:04.102 --> 30:05.467
Things with Julie are great...

30:05.637 --> 30:08.902
...and I'm so grateful to you and Taylor,
but Kaitlin, she just--

30:09.073 --> 30:11.701
I don't know, she just seems
to want to shut me out.

30:11.876 --> 30:15.471
And I know that you have some experience
with the Cooper women, so--

30:15.647 --> 30:18.673
Well, a Porsche
would probably do the trick.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.751
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that's not really in my budget.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.013
Well, Kaitlin's had a tough year.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.619
Once she sees that her mom's happy,
she'll come around.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.727
Just be patient.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.361
Suddenly,
a Porsche sounds like a bargain.

30:33.698 --> 30:35.131
Right.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.468
Look, I gotta get going,
help set up Taylor's party.

30:39.637 --> 30:41.332
Oh, sure. Is that her present?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.671
Oh, yeah. It's....

30:43.842 --> 30:48.973
She translated these French love poems,
so I had them bound in leather for her.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.805
-My son, the romantic.
-Yeah.

30:52.984 --> 30:56.545
-So I'll see you tonight.
-Yeah.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.985
It's not that romantic.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.389
It's gonna be fine.
Ryan will give you a romantic present...

31:03.561 --> 31:06.962
...tell you he loves you, and you'll go
to Berkeley together. Don't worry.

31:07.131 --> 31:10.259
I know. Do you think I should act surprised
when I go to the party?

31:10.435 --> 31:13.268
-It's not a surprise party.
-But it might make Ryan feel good.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.372
Okay, that's a great idea.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.507
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.165
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.778
-Oh, my God, what a surprise.
-I didn't know it was a surprise party.

31:22.947 --> 31:24.278
Just go with it. It's Taylor.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.517
Happy birthday.

31:29.087 --> 31:31.851
-This is amazing.
-Yeah, well, you deserve it.

31:32.023 --> 31:34.150
You got a lot of birthdays to catch up on.

31:38.263 --> 31:41.357
-ls everything okay?
-Yeah, absolutely. Let me get you a drink.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.032
Okay.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.668
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.270
-Oh, baby.
-Happy birthday.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.523
Thank you.

32:10.128 --> 32:11.823
We can move.

32:11.996 --> 32:13.293
I mean it.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.329
Ryan and Seth will be gone
in six months.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.060
We put the house on the market,
throw a dart at the map.

32:18.236 --> 32:20.636
-Maybe it's time.
-But this is our home.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.296
So? We'll make someplace new
our home.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.102
You know, we'll still have our memories.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.777
But when Ryan and Seth come home
for the holidays...

32:28.947 --> 32:31.245
...I want them to come home
to that house.

32:31.849 --> 32:33.111
It was an idea.

32:33.985 --> 32:36.078
Oh, thanks, Sandy.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.279
I just don't think I can.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.521
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:42.694 --> 32:46.687
It's a replica of the Green Destiny sword
from Crouching Tiger. Oh, my God.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.593
-Thank you so much.
-Glad you like it.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.165
-So neat.
-Open Ryan's present.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.769
-Okay, where is it?
-Oh, no, no, no. No, it's okay.

32:52.937 --> 32:56.202
-Ryan's embarrassed.
-No, it's just-- It's personal.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.636
Well, I hope so.

32:59.811 --> 33:00.800
Oh, my God, it's--

33:01.813 --> 33:04.008
A dictionary?

33:07.151 --> 33:08.448
That is practical.

33:08.619 --> 33:14.148
Yeah, the guy said
that it had more words than others.

33:14.325 --> 33:18.284
Well, that's good,
being as it is a dictionary.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.287
It's red. That's a cool color.

33:38.983 --> 33:41.042
I still love him, you know? I just--

33:42.153 --> 33:44.144
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this.

33:44.322 --> 33:47.155
No, I understand. I worry about him a lot.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.294
You know, I know making this movie
just seems so stupid...

33:50.461 --> 33:53.521
...but I just wanted him to get excited
about something. Anything.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.926
Just give him a chance.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.264
-Seth will find his way.
-I hope so.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.172
He just seems a little lost.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.540
What--? Those are mine.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.719
What do you think you're doing?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.913
He likes clown porn.
Everyone should know.

34:19.090 --> 34:22.389
Do you have any idea how humiliated
Frank would be if he saw this?

34:22.560 --> 34:26.052
Or if Ryan saw it? It's his father, Kaitlin.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.199
-Whatever.
-Do not walk away from me.

34:29.500 --> 34:33.231
I've tried to be understanding.
I'm sorry if Frank isn't as hilarious as Bullit--

34:33.404 --> 34:36.464
-It's not even about that.
-Then what is it? Is it the money?

34:37.308 --> 34:38.536
Mom, look at us.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.576
In the past year,
we've lost Dad, we've lost Marissa.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.273
We had Dr. Roberts and we lost him.
And then we got the Bullit, lost him.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.678
What makes you think that this guy
is gonna stick around any longer?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.286
Kaitlin, am I crazy?

34:50.455 --> 34:53.014
Or did you say that it was okay
for me to date Frank?

34:53.190 --> 34:54.658
Yes, to date him.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.624
But it's been a week,
he's practically living in our house.

34:57.995 --> 35:00.327
Like he's family. He is not family.

35:00.498 --> 35:01.931
You and I are.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.194
I mean, why can't we just act like that
for a little while?

35:06.104 --> 35:09.699
Hey, they're about to bring out the cake.

35:12.009 --> 35:13.909
Is everything okay?

35:15.746 --> 35:17.680
Yes, everything's fine.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.340
Kaitlin, why don't you go back inside?

35:27.625 --> 35:29.183
Taylor.

35:33.331 --> 35:36.789
-Taylor, I'm sorry.
-I'm not crazy, right?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.766
-Last night, you did tell me you loved me?
-Yeah, I did.

35:39.937 --> 35:42.997
Okay, then what?
Are you trying to send me a message?

35:43.174 --> 35:45.267
-Do you wish you hadn't said it?
-No.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.741
Last night when I told you....

35:49.881 --> 35:51.348
You mentioned going to Berkeley.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.950
Oh, God, I knew it.

35:54.118 --> 35:56.780
Ryan, yes, I applied to Berkeley...

35:56.954 --> 36:00.788
...months ago.
Before you and I ever started dating.

36:02.593 --> 36:07.792
And then, this you-and-I happened
and I thought-- I don't know, maybe.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.830
And I guess I should have told you...

36:10.001 --> 36:13.334
...but I really needed to know
exactly how you felt first.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.638
I just think us planning to go
to college together...

36:16.807 --> 36:18.832
...it's a big decision.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.173
Would you have said you loved me
if you'd known I'd gotten into Berkeley?

36:28.119 --> 36:29.746
Great.

36:30.488 --> 36:33.184
Well, okay, I'm just gonna go.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.881
Taylor.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.660
She's coming. She's coming.

37:01.118 --> 37:04.986
Come on, this is where you blow out
the candles and make a wish.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.410
Sorry.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.487
Don't worry.
Kirsten and I'll square up things here.

37:38.656 --> 37:42.251
All right, great, thanks.
I gave Seth the car to carry the presents.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.589
-So where are you going now?
-I don't know.

37:45.763 --> 37:46.991
I'll see you later.

37:53.237 --> 37:55.728
Hey. You okay?

37:56.073 --> 37:58.303
Yeah, sure.

37:59.076 --> 38:03.843
But by the looks of it, you and I aren't
gonna be brother and sister any time soon.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.144
Oh, no.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.650
-What happened?
-Honestly, it was me.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.779
I mean, look, Ryan,
I have absolutely nothing against your dad.

38:13.958 --> 38:18.122
It's just I really didn't wanna rush
into an insta-family again.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.526
I mean, how long would this one last?
A month?

38:20.698 --> 38:21.926
Well, you never know.

38:22.099 --> 38:25.660
I mean, I moved in with the Cohens,
I gave it a week.

38:25.903 --> 38:27.131
Here I am.

38:29.206 --> 38:33.506
I just wish there was a way you could tell
if it was all gonna work out.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.646
Yeah, but there isn't.

38:35.813 --> 38:39.010
But I promise you,
I will always be your brother.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.073
In a completely non-creepy way.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.385
-Kaitlin, honey, can I talk to you?
-Yeah.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.152
Wait. Ryan, as your sister...

38:50.328 --> 38:53.991
...if you don't tell Taylor
that you love her, you're an idiot.

38:54.699 --> 38:55.893
She's right.

39:04.742 --> 39:07.438
I just wanted him to get excited
about something. Anything.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.442
-Oh, no.
-Just give him a chance.

39:09.613 --> 39:12.980
-I'm so sorry you had to overhear that.
-No, it's all right. It's true.

39:13.150 --> 39:16.119
What I was gonna say is,
I think what you made is really good.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.579
Yeah, there's no coherent theme...

39:18.756 --> 39:22.248
...most of the shots are too wide,
and the dogma thing's been done to death.

39:22.426 --> 39:26.021
But I get that you wanted me to find
something that I'm passionate about...

39:26.197 --> 39:29.166
-...the way you are about the environment.
-But you love movies.

39:29.333 --> 39:33.269
I do. I love going to them and then
telling people what's wrong with them.

39:34.472 --> 39:35.837
What is it?

39:36.006 --> 39:38.600
-I could be a critic.
-Spend your life watching movies...

39:38.776 --> 39:42.041
-...telling people how terrible they are?
-Yeah, that sounds awesome.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.676
I want you to find something
that you care about.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.073
You wanna go rent
An Inconvenient Truth?

39:47.551 --> 39:49.951
-Yes, I love that movie.
-I wanna count the number...

39:50.121 --> 39:53.579
...of gratuitously soulful shots of Al Gore
staring out an airplane window.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.727
Do not insult Al Gore.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.293
So, what did you tell Frank?

40:00.464 --> 40:02.591
I told him we needed to slow it down.

40:02.767 --> 40:06.601
-Mom, if you really like him, you know--
-I do, and he's not going away.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.238
But I told him that right now...

40:08.406 --> 40:10.874
...I need to be spending some time
with my daughter.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.379
Does that include buying me ice cream?

40:15.880 --> 40:17.711
Absolutely.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.048
-What's happening, hot stuff?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

40:22.453 --> 40:24.751
The hermit? My soul card is the hermit?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.549
Are you kidding me?

40:27.758 --> 40:30.989
Okay, Esmeralda, I have to go.
I'll call you next year.

40:31.328 --> 40:32.989
Come in.

40:33.964 --> 40:36.057
Hey, hope I'm not interrupting.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.924
No.

40:38.135 --> 40:39.363
I got you something.

40:54.084 --> 40:56.018
Okay.

40:58.522 --> 41:00.422
These are all poems that I've translated.

41:00.591 --> 41:04.789
I collected them, recopied them,
had them bound.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.091
Ryan, this is amazing.

41:08.265 --> 41:09.823
Are you sure this is from you?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.298
Taylor, I'm sorry. I....

41:12.470 --> 41:14.267
I freaked out.

41:15.372 --> 41:16.896
What I said last night, I meant.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.031
Really?

41:19.343 --> 41:21.038
I love you.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.107
And I don't wanna lose you.

41:25.282 --> 41:28.080
So let's put it all on the table.

41:28.552 --> 41:32.352
Berkeley, Paris, Oxford, anything.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.761
-I don't know what to say.
-That's a first.

41:48.706 --> 41:50.901
-Oh, my God. Mom?
-It's okay, it's just--

41:51.075 --> 41:53.908
-It's an earthquake. Get in.
-Mom.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.624
Seth?

42:23.874 --> 42:25.000
Kirsten?

42:26.305 --> 42:32.900
