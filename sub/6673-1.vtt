01:15.659 --> 01:20.538
Once, when I was six years old,
I read a book about the primeval forest.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.709
The book said,

01:24.835 --> 01:28.463
"Boa constrictors swallow
their prey whole, without chewing it."

01:32.843 --> 01:37.680
I pondered this deeply.
And then, I made my first drawing.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.225
I showed my masterpiece to grown-ups

01:41.351 --> 01:43.770
and asked if the drawing
frightened them.

01:43.854 --> 01:44.937
Frightened?

01:45.022 --> 01:47.815
Why should anyone
be frightened of a hat?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.484
Grown-ups.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.986
I never understand
anything by themselves.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.490
So, I made another drawing.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.285
Yes. My advice
is stick to arithmetic.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.662
- History.
- And grammar.

02:02.331 --> 02:06.000
I took their advice and I grew up.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.213
I forgot all about being a child.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.383
Until something miraculous happened.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.567
"The Little Prince"

02:38.742 --> 02:42.328
I've always wanted to find
someone to share my story with, but...

02:42.412 --> 02:44.330
I don't know, I...

02:44.414 --> 02:47.750
I guess this world just got too grown-up.

02:50.754 --> 02:55.758
Good morning, We manage the consequence
today figures we managed counter...

02:55.884 --> 02:58.636
Record-breaking numbers
were written down on pieces of paper,

02:58.762 --> 03:01.889
taken to the bank,
placed in drawers and locked with keys.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.768
Back straight.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.895
Listening attentively.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.438
Listening.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.441
No excessive blinking.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.694
Listening.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.154
Unexpected praise.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.408
Acknowledge and thank you.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.078
It's a smile, sweetie.
Show your teeth.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.455
No, Ooh. Not too much.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.416
Good. Okay.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.293
Now remember,

03:30.419 --> 03:33.754
accept holding an historical data tell
and leaning toward acceptance,

03:33.839 --> 03:35.882
they will ask only one question.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.008
The big question.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.511
"Are you Werth Academy material?"

03:41.805 --> 03:43.472
"Yes, I am."

03:44.141 --> 03:46.601
"Three things make me
Werth Academic Material...

03:53.984 --> 03:55.443
Zero-one-seven?

03:57.321 --> 03:58.362
Go on.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.637
We've reviewed
your application, Good.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.513
Thank you!

04:25.933 --> 04:27.516
We've reviewed your transcripts...

04:27.643 --> 04:29.769
Thank... You.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.025
We've read your essay,

04:36.109 --> 04:39.028
"The transformative power of zero
on the bottom line"

04:39.154 --> 04:41.614
and the follow-up, "Zero, still my hero."

04:45.535 --> 04:48.204
Yes, you've done your work.
Everything looks to be in place.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.459
We will ask you just one question today.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.961
The big question!

04:55.170 --> 04:57.171
"Are you Werth Academy material?"

04:58.674 --> 05:02.134
What will you be
when you grow up?

05:04.513 --> 05:06.222
Yes, I am.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.225
Three things make me
Werth Academy material.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.393
No. No.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.728
One, like Werth, I am sensible.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.730
Two, like Werth, I am serious.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.816
- Stop.
- Three...

05:16.900 --> 05:18.484
- Like Werth...
- Stop!

05:19.236 --> 05:21.529
My unwavering...

05:21.905 --> 05:23.489
Abort... Abort.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.158
...con... concern, with.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.411
the...

05:32.165 --> 05:33.249
Thank you.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.085
Sweetie!

05:37.587 --> 05:41.757
"What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

05:41.842 --> 05:43.217
"Essential."

05:48.932 --> 05:51.892
Apparently,
they changed the big question.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.896
I'm sorry, Mom.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.898
Don't be.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.026
We'll just gonna have to go to Plan B.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.193
"B"?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.195
You said Plan B was impossible!

06:03.280 --> 06:04.520
That's why we went with Plan A.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.116
Plan B is the new Plan A.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.286
We're moving forward!

06:12.080 --> 06:13.539
Neighbourhood identified. Check.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.043
If by some miracle we can find
a house in the neighborhood we can afford. 

06:17.127 --> 06:18.999
they will have to take you.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.088
"Reduced Price Houce For Sale."

06:22.549 --> 06:26.800
Check. Check. Check.

06:26.801 --> 06:28.387
Moving truck, check.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.222
- "First Day Of Summer Holidays"
- Mattters of consequence for the serious...

06:30.307 --> 06:32.933
and sensible man...
comprehension council...

06:33.101 --> 06:34.393
We did it!

06:34.561 --> 06:37.396
You're going to Werth Academy
whether they want you or not.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.776
Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive,
it comes to the same thing for us.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.573
MAN: No one is ever satisfied
where he is, they're pursuing nothing...

06:50.952 --> 06:53.579
Our new home. Check.

07:10.474 --> 07:15.351
Uhh? Is it too late for a Plan C?

07:15.811 --> 07:21.357
Just keep reminding yourself
that house made this house available,

07:21.817 --> 07:23.859
and made your future possible.

07:42.015 --> 07:43.504
Um, Mom?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.055
Do you really think that
I'm Werth Academy material?

07:53.181 --> 07:56.559
You will be by the end of the summer.
Beacuse I have to sign a plan.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.228
Ooh, Right on time.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.899
I call it your life plan.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.401
"Life plan?"

08:08.738 --> 08:10.322
Your life plan.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.075
We're not leaving anything to chance.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.203
Everything's here.
Oriented top to bottom. Left to right.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.830
Let's take a look.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.749
The minute of the hour,
hour of the day, The day of the week,

08:20.834 --> 08:24.086
The week of the month, The month of the
year, the year of your life.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.172
Everything! Got it?

08:30.177 --> 08:32.595
It's even got a chart
for all your birthday gifts.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.264
Like your ninth birthday,
coming up. Microscope.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.892
Perfect for the
Werth Academy biology curriculum.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.602
It's already wrapped.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.770
- Wow.
- Yes. Wow!

08:42.022 --> 08:45.107
But for now, all your attention
should be focused here

08:45.567 --> 08:47.568
The first day of your new school.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.947
We've got 53 days to prep up,
which doesn't sound like much,

08:52.032 --> 08:55.117
until you break it into hours, 1,272.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.786
Or minutes, 76,320.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.207
Only then do you realise
how much can be accomplished.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.960
You will use those minutes,
hours and days according to this.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.046
Because, let's face it,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.548
you're going to be all alone out there.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.134
All alone.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.804
So...

09:15.931 --> 09:18.307
We can't afford any more mistakes,
like the interview.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.433
Right.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.812
You are going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.314
Thank you, Mom.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.903
I wish I could stay, sweetie,
but it's the Davis audit, again.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.572
The Kelly numbers on the Miller
oversighted are still problematic.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.492
Only this time Fines caught wind of it
now Logan's in a panic.

09:36.993 --> 09:37.993
and Fisher wants nothing to do with it...

09:38.119 --> 09:39.161
Logan.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.580
- Now, I've gotta to go in...
- And make it all the hands out.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.333
I'm... I'm not even sure
that's possible.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.336
If anyone can do it, it's you. you go.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.129
I've got the life plan!

09:49.464 --> 09:51.257
You're my senior VP.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.811
Okay.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.680
Gas.

11:03.421 --> 11:05.420
No, no, no, no!

11:24.934 --> 11:27.269
Anybody home?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.026
Bolts...

11:52.962 --> 11:55.297
I didn't actually believe
he had a plane back there.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.217
I think the old guy
flew away years ago.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.053
I'm just thankful
we don't live next door to him.

12:02.764 --> 12:03.889
Roger that.

12:11.474 --> 12:14.908
- Oh, well, hello there!
- Huh?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.320
A very good afternoon to you, Officer.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.155
Friends!

12:26.454 --> 12:29.832
I was just...
I was immersed in a game of bridge.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.625
Do you play?

12:36.631 --> 12:41.135
Sir, did you try to start your plane again?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.682
Yes, yes, I did.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.018
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.189
I do believe I have caused extensive
damage to the house next door.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.817
Downtown?

12:57.444 --> 12:58.861
I'd rather not.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.487
Ooh, Hold on.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.999
I know It's here, somewhere.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.036
What?

13:13.668 --> 13:14.877
Found it!

13:16.112 --> 13:17.296
Sir...

13:29.017 --> 13:31.560
Hey, I'm home. I brought Chinese.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.228
- Mom?
- Oh.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.354
- Hi.
- Uh...

13:35.148 --> 13:36.732
Hi.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.570
Where did you get the pennies?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.822
The old man next door.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.578
Actually, it was the police officer
who "gave" them to me.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.330
What?

13:54.417 --> 13:59.087
What kind of a nut keeps an airplane,
and actually starts it, in his backyard?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.940
- Honey, are you sure you're okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.510
- I have to call the insurance agent.
- Done it.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.929
- And file a police report.
- Done. In duplicate.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.348
- Photo documentation?
- Inside and outside.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.433
The lighting could have been better.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.602
It's not so bad.

14:20.068 --> 14:24.780
We'll call a contractor in the morning
and we'll forget the old man even exists.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.406
Forgotten.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.784
Matters of consequence,

14:29.202 --> 14:32.371
let's recap today's recaps,
of today's market activity,

14:32.455 --> 14:35.374
with a detailed account...
Numbers of the day.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.428
There are also hundreds of others...

15:34.100 --> 15:38.103
"Once upon a time there was
a little prince who lived on a planet

15:38.187 --> 15:42.524
"that was scarcely bigger than himself,
and who had need of..."

15:42.609 --> 15:43.650
A friend?

15:44.152 --> 15:46.028
I thought you could use a friend!

15:47.488 --> 15:49.865
No, no. here I am, up here.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.826
Yup, Here! Hi.

15:54.829 --> 15:58.206
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's just the beginning of the story.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.876
Uh, It's okay.
Nobody understands it anyway.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.836
All right, bye-bye.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.213
See you later, maybe.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.056
She made the most frightful noise.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.058
It resounded all over the place.

16:24.067 --> 16:27.361
- Maybe during lunch...
- I can count those pennies.

17:20.015 --> 17:23.500
Oooh.

17:45.005 --> 17:47.230
Ow!

18:58.304 --> 19:01.556
Once upon a time
there was a little prince

19:01.682 --> 19:04.893
who lived on a planet
that was scarcely bigger than himself,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.686
and who had need of a friend.

19:22.704 --> 19:27.332
"And I lived my life alone
without anyone I could really talk to.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.252
"So I learned to pilot airplanes."

19:47.520 --> 19:49.938
I flew more or less
all over the world,

19:50.064 --> 19:53.567
until I had an accident
in the Sahara desert.

20:59.634 --> 21:03.678
If you please, draw me a sheep!

21:07.475 --> 21:09.851
If you please, draw me a sheep.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.277
Draw me a sheep!

21:19.820 --> 21:24.032
When a mystery is too
over-powering, one dare not disobey.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.160
Draw? I don't know how to draw.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.496
That doesn't matter.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.542
The first sheep I drew was too sickly.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.490
And the second one,
not to his liking either.

21:38.491 --> 21:41.800
Don't you see? that's not a sheep.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.219
This is a ram, it has horns.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.514
- And this one was...
- Too old!

21:50.351 --> 21:53.812
I want a sheep
that will live for a long time.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.858
So, I drew this.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.531
The sheep you ask for is inside.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.410
That is exactly the way I wanted it!

22:10.913 --> 22:13.957
Do you think this sheep
will eat a great deal of grass?

22:13.958 --> 22:17.168
Because where I live,
everything is very small.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.505
Well, I'm sure there will be
enough grass for him.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.048
He's a very small sheep.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.135
Not so small that... Look!
He's gone to sleep.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.889
Wow.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.420
Hello?

23:52.890 --> 23:53.932
Hello?

23:54.809 --> 23:55.892
Hello!

24:04.777 --> 24:06.611
Hold on. Don't move.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.659
Yeah.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.327
Uh, Here we go.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.205
Wow.

24:39.687 --> 24:43.398
I... I just wanted to give
your drawing back.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.567
Oh, You didn't like it?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.443
- No. No I did.
- Well, I...

24:47.945 --> 24:49.028
It's not very good.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.446
I think it's nice.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.991
I read a story, too. Attentively.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.494
And I found it quite odd.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.329
Odd?

24:58.455 --> 25:01.124
I mean curious... Or interesting...

25:01.375 --> 25:03.668
I guess I have some issues
with some of the facts.

25:04.712 --> 25:05.795
You have questions?

25:05.880 --> 25:08.214
I don't mean to be rude. Can I?

25:08.382 --> 25:10.842
What? Be rude?
Sure, go ahead. What you got?

25:11.385 --> 25:15.054
Well, first of all, what was the kid
doing there in the desert?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.181
That's very strange.

25:16.265 --> 25:19.434
No one can last very long
in a desert without food and water.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.353
Where are his parents?
Does he even go to school?

25:22.521 --> 25:25.231
Does he really live up there?
Because I took basic astronomy

25:25.316 --> 25:29.068
and there was no mention of life,
or children, on any other planets.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.071
Unless it's true
that he came from a star.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.239
But that seem improbable.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.159
Not a star. An asteroid.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.828
Asteroid B-612.

25:38.913 --> 25:41.748
Oh, we didn't cover asteroids.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.836
But the fact that he wanted a sheep,
that pretty much proves that he exists.

25:47.338 --> 25:48.922
Don't you think?

25:55.930 --> 25:58.723
Hold on, I'm just gonna
find you another drawing.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.188
Wow.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.816
This is a pretty serious fire hazard.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.402
Huh, I never looked at it that way.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.154
Where did you get all this stuff?

26:13.572 --> 26:17.992
Oh, well, as you live you'll own
some things just kind of stick to you.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.662
There is a name for it...

26:21.038 --> 26:22.163
- Collecting?
- Hoarding!

26:22.456 --> 26:23.957
That's it, hoarding.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.834
That's what I am, a hoarder.
A bit of a hoarder.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.632
What's your name, little fox?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.009
Oh. He can't answer you.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.720
I keep meaning to sew him a mouth.

26:50.985 --> 26:53.736
Are... are you okay?

26:53.821 --> 26:56.322
Oh. I'm fine, this happens sometimes.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.032
Just need a minute.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.202
The last time this happened,
I was down here for three days.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.704
- Three days?
- That's okay.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.624
That's why I always keep a sandwich
in my pocket. You want a bite?

27:06.709 --> 27:08.167
Baloney?

27:08.919 --> 27:11.587
I think I'm baloney intolerant.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.881
I think It's Baloney.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.930
It's going to be a clear night.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.025
The stars will be out soon.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.861
Wow.

27:38.032 --> 27:42.118
The Little Prince,
he was very fond of sunsets.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.371
One day he saw 44 of them.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.081
Uh, What?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.375
Well, His planet, it was so small,

27:49.460 --> 27:53.379
all he had to do was move his chair
a few steps to see another one.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.217
But a small planet also had drawbacks.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.971
He needed
a sheep to eat the baobab sprouts.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.765
- Baobab?
- Yeah.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.725
It's a very greedy tree.

28:06.602 --> 28:11.439
And every day, he toiled
to stop them from turning up.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.733
For if you intervene too late...

28:14.276 --> 28:15.943
Catastrophe.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.572
Now, luckily, there are good seeds, too.

28:19.865 --> 28:24.452
And one day, from a seed blown
from no one knew where,

28:24.828 --> 28:27.830
a new kind of sprout came up.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.840
I know you'll be miraculous.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.592
I know you will.

28:54.276 --> 28:57.819
Wow! How beautiful you are!

28:57.986 --> 28:59.404
I'm only half awake.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.073
Forgive me, I'm still quite dishevelled.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.533
You're perfect.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.284
Am I not?

29:05.911 --> 29:08.830
I was born at the same
moment as the sun.

29:14.044 --> 29:18.047
It was there they shared
their first sunrise

29:19.591 --> 29:22.301
and their first sunset.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.180
- It's very cold where you live.
- Oh.

29:32.229 --> 29:35.356
If you would have the kindness
to think of my needs?

29:36.150 --> 29:39.652
But the Rose began very quickly
to torment him with her vanity.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.904
I suppose you wouldn't have a screen?

29:42.072 --> 29:44.740
And at night I want you
to put me under a glass.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.659
A glass globe, now. My needs...

29:46.743 --> 29:47.994
My beauty... My screen...

29:48.495 --> 29:51.873
Now, the shame of it was
that they loved each other.

29:52.499 --> 29:56.502
But they were both too young
to know how to love.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.632
Full of doubt, he ran away.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.552
Of course I love you.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.263
If you're not aware of that, it's my fault.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.681
Please forgive me.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.026
He left her? All alone?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.487
But where did he go?

30:22.946 --> 30:25.406
Well, He didn't know it at the time,

30:25.491 --> 30:29.076
but his leaving was just the first step
on a journey back to her.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.870
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.332
Look at that, the stars are out.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.048
Wow.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.175
They're so bright.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.762
There are so many to look at.

30:48.555 --> 30:52.141
And on a good day, if I listen carefully,

30:52.226 --> 30:54.560
I can hear him laughing up there.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.077
Oh, No! I gotta go!

31:20.587 --> 31:22.922
Sweetie? Where are you?

31:28.053 --> 31:29.095
Oh, Hi.

31:29.638 --> 31:33.140
Your desk is a mess.
Did you finish your study work for today?

31:33.251 --> 31:37.353
Uh, not exactly.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.272
Well, What have you been doing?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.941
I've read a lot...

31:42.609 --> 31:44.443
And I made a friend.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.280
A friend?

31:47.906 --> 31:51.534
No. no, no, no, no, no.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.786
Nope.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.746
Maybe...

31:57.374 --> 31:58.624
Yes.

31:58.709 --> 31:59.792
Okay.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.588
"FRIEND"

32:03.672 --> 32:07.216
If you study hard and you stay
completely on track with the plan,

32:07.301 --> 32:10.177
you can spend some time
with your new friend.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.347
Next summer,
on Thursdays, from 1:00 to 1:30.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.225
Okay? Can't wait to meet her.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.781
"He found himself
in the neighbourhood of asteroids

32:30.866 --> 32:35.036
325, 326, 327,

32:35.537 --> 32:40.166
"328, 329, 330..."

32:43.211 --> 32:45.463
What? what? Oh.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.506
It is a subject.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.467
Approach.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.636
Sire, over what do you rule?

32:52.012 --> 32:53.846
Over everything.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.098
And the stars obey you?

32:56.183 --> 32:59.852
They certainly do.
I do not commit insubordination.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.981
I would very much like to see a sunset.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.609
It would remind me of my rose.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.653
Could you order the sun to set.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.992
You shall have your sunset.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.744
I shall command it.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.039
But I shall wait
until conditions are favourable.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.415
When will that be?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.960
Well, that will be about... about, uh...

33:25.045 --> 33:30.091
That will be this evening,
about 20 minutes to 8:00.

33:36.223 --> 33:37.682
Good morning.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.809
You're wearing a funny kind of hat.

33:39.935 --> 33:44.689
What... It is a hat for salutes, actually.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.191
To raise when people acclaim me.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.903
Clap your hands, yeah.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.240
Thank you. Thank you.

33:54.324 --> 33:55.616
Oh, see?

33:58.954 --> 34:02.832
Do you really admire me very much?

34:03.959 --> 34:07.753
Am I not the handsomest,
the best-dressed, the richest...

34:08.422 --> 34:11.047
I'm the most intelligent
man on this planet?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.885
But you're the only man on this planet.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.389
Do me this kindness and...

34:19.014 --> 34:22.016
Admire me just the same, please.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.481
I own the stars...

34:27.649 --> 34:29.442
I have manage to them.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.277
I count them, then I recount them.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.946
But what good does that do you?

34:34.114 --> 34:37.699
Well, it does me the good
of making me rich. How's that?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.536
And what good does it
do you to be rich?

34:40.871 --> 34:43.789
It makes it possible for me
to buy more stars.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.833
Plus anything else you can think of.

34:49.087 --> 34:53.299
Grown-ups are certainly very odd.

34:55.302 --> 34:59.430
And check.
And Check. And Check.

35:00.724 --> 35:01.807
Check.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.392
Check.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.645
And check. And check.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.232
Check, Check, Check,
Check, Check, Check...

35:14.821 --> 35:19.784
Grown-ups are certainly
very, very, very odd.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.411
I've lived a great deal among grown-ups.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.955
I have seen them
intimately close in hand.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.541
And that hasn't much changed
my opinion of them.

35:28.001 --> 35:31.587
Well, I'm not so sure
I want to grow up any more.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.923
Growing up is not the problem.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.800
Forgetting is.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.303
I definitely don't want to forget.

35:39.638 --> 35:43.516
I managed to grow up
and I never forgot The Little Prince.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.566
Yeah...

36:21.805 --> 36:23.013
Good evening.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.227
Good evening.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.770
What planet is this?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.981
This is Earth.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.190
This is Africa.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.318
Where are all the men?

36:36.528 --> 36:38.863
It is a little lonely in the desert.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.156
It is also lonely among men.

36:42.075 --> 36:45.420
You are a funny animal.
You are no thicker than a finger.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.207
But I am more powerful
than the finger of a king.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.334
You haven't any feet.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.628
You cannot even travel.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.132
I can carry you further
than any ship can take you.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.180
I can help you someday, if you go too
home-sick for your own planet.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.975
I think I understand you.

37:12.105 --> 37:15.649
There you go,
try that one on the left there.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.278
I'm scared.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.614
That's normal. It is scary.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.366
Why do you think I sent you?

37:27.162 --> 37:29.496
Almost there. You got it now.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.957
Just reach! Reach for it!

37:33.460 --> 37:35.794
- I got it!
- There you go! You got it!

37:42.510 --> 37:44.678
- Well, that was...
- Ow!

37:44.930 --> 37:46.722
That was double scary, huh?

37:47.724 --> 37:49.516
Triple and quadruple.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.977
We're going to have to amputate them.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.729
What?

37:59.653 --> 38:01.820
- Feels better, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.751
But it happened that after
walking a long time through sand,

38:16.294 --> 38:17.836
and rocks, and snow,

38:18.213 --> 38:20.005
The Fox appeared.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.269
Hey! Come and play with me.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.981
I cannot play with you.

38:37.399 --> 38:38.691
I'm not tamed.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.401
What does that mean?

38:41.486 --> 38:43.487
Tame means, "To establish ties."

38:43.947 --> 38:46.323
To me, you're still
nothing more than a little boy

38:46.408 --> 38:49.076
who is just like 100,000 other little boys.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.495
And I have no need of you.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.913
And you have no need of me.

38:53.707 --> 38:57.418
To you, I'm nothing more
than a fox like 100,000 foxes.

38:58.044 --> 39:01.046
But if you tame me,
then we shall need each other.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.234
- Oh, Hey, there.
- Oh.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.471
To me, you will be
unique in all the world.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.557
And to you, I shall be
unique in all the world.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.527
Who are you?

41:28.611 --> 41:30.863
We are roses.

41:33.366 --> 41:36.326
My rose is just a common rose?

41:37.203 --> 41:40.914
But she told me she was the only one of
her kind in the whole universe.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.334
But she is not a common rose.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.586
She is your rose.

41:46.379 --> 41:49.923
It is the time that you have devoted
to her that makes your rose so important.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.759
She's my rose.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.220
You must return to her.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.980
Oh, no, you're gonna cry?

42:06.399 --> 42:09.318
My taming you
has done you no good at all.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.782
Let me make you a present of a secret.

42:17.911 --> 42:20.162
It is only with the heart....

42:20.246 --> 42:22.956
that one can see rightly.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.668
What is essential is invisible to the eye.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.132
They won't be together anymore?

42:33.927 --> 42:35.010
But they will.

42:36.095 --> 42:39.723
The Fox, he sees The Little Prince
when he looks with his heart.

42:40.266 --> 42:43.435
If you can do that,
you'll never be lonely again.

42:44.103 --> 42:47.648
Right. But I'm not lonely.
I've got you now.

42:47.666 --> 42:50.275
Oh, I'm so lucky.

42:50.360 --> 42:54.029
I thought I'd never find anyone
who wanted to hear my story.

42:54.113 --> 42:57.032
Then you came along. Just in time.

42:58.826 --> 42:59.910
Wait...

43:01.162 --> 43:03.413
What do you mean, "Just in time"?

43:06.459 --> 43:11.588
Well, everyone has
to say goodbye sooner or later.

43:12.799 --> 43:13.966
You're leaving?

43:14.634 --> 43:16.218
Well...

43:16.302 --> 43:19.888
What if I get that old plane running?

43:20.723 --> 43:22.474
What if it's time for me to...

43:23.226 --> 43:25.852
well you know, go be
with The Little Prince?

43:26.980 --> 43:28.021
But...

43:28.523 --> 43:30.148
He already has his rose...

43:31.359 --> 43:33.193
And I need you here.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.743
Hey. Hey.

43:42.912 --> 43:43.996
You hungry?

43:44.539 --> 43:45.831
I know a great place

43:45.915 --> 43:49.001
where we can get
free pancakes on your birthday.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.878
But my birthday's not for two weeks.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.463
They don't know that.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.516
It's uh... It's like flying a plane.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.313
Like the one you crashed?

44:09.397 --> 44:10.647
Exactly!

44:55.401 --> 44:57.277
Uh, what?

45:06.871 --> 45:08.705
Pull over.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.386
Do you have a driver's licence?

45:22.470 --> 45:23.595
No.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.348
- A learner's permit?
- No.

45:26.432 --> 45:27.557
How old are you?

45:27.642 --> 45:31.103
- Hi, Officer.
- You obviously started your car, again.

45:31.187 --> 45:32.562
Yeah...

45:32.647 --> 45:36.358
Good afternoon, Officer.
If I may interjects for a moment...

45:36.651 --> 45:38.902
Did you know, It's my birthday?

45:43.241 --> 45:44.991
- Mom, I can...
- Wait for me inside.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.410
- But...
- Now.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.747
Ma'am, I'm very sorry
to pull you at work.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.750
Apparently, they were going
to get pancakes...

45:56.045 --> 45:58.505
- Would you like to speak to him?
- Yes...

45:58.589 --> 46:01.550
No! No, No! No!

46:10.393 --> 46:12.185
Mr. Fox!

46:13.813 --> 46:16.481
According to this,
you're still in bed.

46:16.566 --> 46:17.941
Asleep. Yesterday.

46:19.861 --> 46:22.654
Your "friend" doesn't even
have a driver's licence.

46:22.738 --> 46:25.699
Oh, No. They took it away
after the fourth time

46:25.783 --> 46:28.618
he drove away
with the gas pump attached.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.080
You could've been killed!

46:32.165 --> 46:35.083
- Mom, I can explain...
- No, no. you mean you can lie.

46:35.168 --> 46:36.751
- But...
- You've been lying to me,

46:36.878 --> 46:38.336
you lie to the Police Officer.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.922
Oh, yes, right. Before I forget,
happy birthday.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.093
You even managed
to lie to your life plan!

46:45.511 --> 46:48.096
That? that is just a one boxes full of magnets!

46:48.222 --> 46:50.307
Sometimes I think you care
more about it more than me.

46:50.391 --> 46:51.892
You're wrong.

46:52.185 --> 46:55.103
I care about it
as much as I care about you.

46:55.688 --> 46:56.980
It is you.

46:57.064 --> 47:00.817
This is your life and I'm the only one
taking any responsibility for it!

47:01.194 --> 47:04.654
That's your version of my life, not mine!

47:04.739 --> 47:07.616
If you were ever around, you'd see that!

47:07.700 --> 47:11.036
You know full well
why I have to work so hard.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.497
You're just like him now.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.916
Too busy, always working.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.376
How long until you
completely disappear?

47:24.342 --> 47:27.052
"I believe that for his
escape he took advantage

47:27.136 --> 47:29.846
"of the migration
of a flock of wild birds?"

47:30.389 --> 47:31.765
Mom, no!

47:31.933 --> 47:34.351
Okay. Okay, enough of this nonsense.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.561
You have two weeks to focus.
On what is essential.

47:36.646 --> 47:37.979
But, Mom!

49:09.155 --> 49:12.073
"Love, Dad"

49:53.199 --> 49:55.075
Let's look for a well.

50:30.695 --> 50:35.073
The stars are beautiful because
of a flower that cannot be seen.

50:41.914 --> 50:46.543
What makes the desert beautiful
is that somewhere it hides a well.

50:49.130 --> 50:54.092
In the moonlight, I looked
at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,

50:54.885 --> 50:57.429
his locks of hair
that trembled in the wind,

50:57.513 --> 50:59.264
and I said to myself,

50:59.348 --> 51:02.892
"What I see here is nothing but a shell.

51:03.894 --> 51:07.814
"What is most important
is what is invisible."

51:20.536 --> 51:22.871
We found a well at daybreak.

51:29.837 --> 51:33.381
The men where you live
grow thousands of roses

51:33.466 --> 51:36.676
and they do not find
what they are looking for.

51:38.262 --> 51:42.015
What they are looking for
could be found in a single rose,

51:42.099 --> 51:43.767
or a little water.

52:15.341 --> 52:16.424
Hold your horses.

52:19.178 --> 52:21.304
Let's go look for a well.

52:21.722 --> 52:23.348
No. No, Listen.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.226
I made a big mistake the other day.

52:26.852 --> 52:28.770
You can't come over here anymore.

52:29.021 --> 52:31.314
- It's okay, this will be the last time.
- What?

52:31.398 --> 52:33.691
Come on, let's go get that plane running!

52:38.739 --> 52:41.783
I figured If you guys managed to
walk into the desert and found a well..

52:41.867 --> 52:44.244
then we can go
and find The Little Prince.

52:45.913 --> 52:47.622
He'll be able to help us.

52:47.748 --> 52:51.543
Wait, little one. We can't just take off.

52:52.294 --> 52:53.461
You're right.

52:53.546 --> 52:55.296
We're gonna have to fix that wing first.

52:55.381 --> 52:56.631
No, no.

52:57.842 --> 53:02.762
I'm sorry, but when
the moment does come for me to leave,

53:03.848 --> 53:05.431
I have to go alone.

53:07.393 --> 53:10.353
But I won't be any trouble,

53:10.437 --> 53:13.231
and I won't take up much room
in the plane. I promise.

53:13.732 --> 53:14.899
Don't go without me.

53:17.444 --> 53:20.780
I think it's time I told you
the end of the story.

53:25.119 --> 53:30.290
That evening, I finished fixing my plane
and I went to find the Little Prince.

53:30.374 --> 53:32.876
I shall be there tonight. Wait for me.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.670
You're sure I won't suffer too long?

53:46.724 --> 53:47.807
Did you shoot it?

53:48.142 --> 53:50.560
No, it disappeared among the stones.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.103
What happened?

53:52.897 --> 53:56.274
Somehow,
he knew that I had fixed my plane.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.615
I, too, am going back home today.

54:03.699 --> 54:05.158
It is much farther.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.951
It is much more difficult.

54:08.537 --> 54:09.829
I am afraid.

54:14.293 --> 54:17.503
I can't believe
I'll never hear you laugh again.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.256
I'm going to make you a present.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.886
In one of those stars, I shall be living.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.722
In one of them, I shall be laughing.

54:28.599 --> 54:31.225
And so, when you look up
at the sky at night,

54:31.518 --> 54:34.604
it'll be as if all the
stars are laughing.

54:42.321 --> 54:44.405
Tonight, do not come.

54:44.490 --> 54:47.533
You didn't let him go?
Not to the Snake!

54:48.827 --> 54:50.161
It wasn't my choice.

54:51.246 --> 54:53.039
It was time for goodbye.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.627
You understand it is too far?

54:57.836 --> 55:01.005
I cannot carry this body with me.

55:01.507 --> 55:04.008
It will be like an old abandoned shell.

55:04.385 --> 55:07.136
There is nothing sad about old shells.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.777
- Here's the place.
- I shall not leave you.

55:49.596 --> 55:50.763
But...

55:52.433 --> 55:53.683
But...

56:01.358 --> 56:04.068
You said he's up there, didn't you?

56:04.153 --> 56:05.403
Back with his rose?

56:05.487 --> 56:06.529
Well...

56:07.614 --> 56:09.198
It is as he said.

56:09.283 --> 56:12.118
I look at the stars
and I hear him laughing.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.996
But you don't know for sure?

56:16.123 --> 56:20.501
It would comfort me
very much to know for sure,

56:20.711 --> 56:24.630
but instead,
I choose to believe he is up there.

56:28.469 --> 56:31.304
Is that what you want me to do
when you go?

56:31.638 --> 56:33.306
Just look up to the stars

56:33.724 --> 56:36.225
and make-believe that you're not gone?

56:36.810 --> 56:37.810
Oh, But...

56:38.228 --> 56:42.231
If you look with your heart,
I'll always be with you.

56:42.649 --> 56:47.070
It's... It's just like I know the Little Prince
will always be with his rose.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.864
But you can't know for sure.

56:50.157 --> 56:52.700
What if he's not back with his rose?

56:53.327 --> 56:55.244
- What if he's all grown up and alone?
- But...

56:55.370 --> 56:58.372
What if he's lost
and he's forgotten everything?

56:59.166 --> 57:01.834
Wait, Sweetheart.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.212
The Little Prince will never forget.

57:04.338 --> 57:07.173
He'll always be up there for us,
to help us.

57:07.674 --> 57:10.843
I don't want his help.
I hate the Little Prince!

57:10.928 --> 57:13.513
I wasted my whole summer on
the Little Prince!

57:13.597 --> 57:16.891
I wish you had never told me
this stupid story.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.260
"LAST DAY OF SUMMER HOLIDAYS"

57:53.929 --> 57:58.015
The weather caused
32 people to be late for work.

57:58.100 --> 58:01.561
Productivity decreased by 0.4%.

58:10.154 --> 58:11.404
Oh, Wait...

58:11.655 --> 58:12.738
Oh, Dear!

58:21.248 --> 58:22.623
Honey, where...

58:28.088 --> 58:29.964
No! No!

58:47.274 --> 58:48.524
Sweetie, No!...

58:55.115 --> 58:56.115
Hey!

59:11.131 --> 59:13.883
Sweetie, stop!
What are you doing?

59:24.978 --> 59:27.396
Stop! You can't go!

59:27.648 --> 59:29.732
Please, I need you here!

59:30.651 --> 59:31.484
No! No, Hey, Hey.

59:31.568 --> 59:34.487
Please! You have to let me see him!

59:34.696 --> 59:37.073
What happened to him?
Is he gonna be okay?

59:45.332 --> 59:46.666
So...

59:47.876 --> 59:51.712
Let's not forget,
tomorrow's an important day.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:30.209
The Aviator needs you.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:34.463
I'm going to find you.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.318
Whoa.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.471
Do you know how to fly a plane?

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:11.143
Yeah, I didn't think so.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.979
Okay, well...

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:22.029
Yes! Yeah, I can do this.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.156
Here, hold these.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.655
I think I've got the hang of it now.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:12.014
I've got you!

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.946
Where are the stars?

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.952
What is that?

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:37.665
A star?

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.794
Wait a minute. That's no star.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:11.699
The Aviator never mentioned this place.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.331
Could it be?

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.544
It's him! It's him!

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.754
What is he doing here?

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.674
Buckle up.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.024
We need a gap.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:50.613
I think I see one up ahead.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.288
Prepare for landing.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.211
We did it!

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:31.278
That wasn't too bad.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.614
Look! Up there.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.254
Step out of the vehicle.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.925
I said step out of the vehicle.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.594
I'm very sorry, Officer.
If I could just explain...

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:58.180
Keep your hands where I can see them.

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:07.815
Unsafe speeding. Unsafe lane changes.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:10.025
- Unsafe everything.
- What?

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.360
Running multiple red lights.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.088
- I'm just trying to find my friend...
- Destruction of city property.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:16.782
Well, A friend of a friend.
We've never officially met.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.993
No use of turn signals. No signals at all.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.954
I just wanted to grab him
and take him home.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:26.166
Attempted kidnapping!
Add that to the list.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.377
Attempted kidnapping.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.631
Hey, are you...

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.386
Thank you.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:38.637
The Conceited Man.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:44.143
Insubordination to a uniformed officer,
of the law, no less.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.644
Me!

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.146
Wait.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.022
Why are you not on your planet?

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:53.420
Oh, you.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:56.196
- Why are you so small?
- Because I'm a child.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:01.577
That is absolutely not allowed here.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:05.247
- Let's go!
- Hey! Oh, Hey! Hey!

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.500
Not so fast!

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:17.843
Thank you. Thank you.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.511
That's right. Go on.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.232
We're gonna need a disguise.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.546
Excuse me. Uh, Pardon me.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.050
Uh, Sir? Could I... Sorry.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.761
Ah, Here are my subjects.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.138
Approach.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.640
Is that the King?

01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:07.392
- 67th floor.
- As you wish.

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:08.935
- 27th floor.
- Granted.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.520
- 14th floor.
- Certainly.

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:12.231
- 142nd floor.
- Of course.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.774
- 34th floor.
- Happily.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.486
Oh, No.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.157
Ahem, Top floor, please.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.911
What? Top floor?

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.747
When conditions are favourable?

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.124
Your Majesty?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.837
Well...

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.174
Conditions are favourable.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.345
It is done.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.536
There he is!

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:16.503
Little Prince! Little Prince!

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.130
What?

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.135
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm okay.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:25.888
My chin.

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.390
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:32.311
No, I was just...
I was just taking a little break, that's all.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.354
I thought you were someone else.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:35.564
You did?

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.817
That's great! That's great.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:40.819
Please don't report me.

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:43.322
Break's over. See? I'm working.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.325
Work, work, work.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.660
No need to report me.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.829
I don't think it was him.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.664
What are we going to do now?

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:57.002
Mr. Prince?

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.757
Can it be?

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:03.508
Excuse me?

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.348
Oh, man! Darn it.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.769
I think you dropped this.

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:15.854
My badge!

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:19.399
- Oh, Catastrophe.
- It is him.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.319
- Can I...
- What happened to you?

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:24.071
Give me that. Please.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.114
The Aviator's not going to like this.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:29.326
- Give it!
- You're not supposed to be like this.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.244
Come on, give me that!

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.038
Thank you.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.999
How does this work?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.878
I'm working. See? I'm being essential.

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:42.381
- Wait, stop!
- No, don't talk to me.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:43.799
I know who you are!

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:46.043
You're the Little Prince,
and you're afraid of baobabs!

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:48.887
No... I'm Mr. Prince,
the maintenance man.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.597
I'm afraid of the Businessman.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.100
You've been in aviator
in the dessert he drew you a sheep!

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:54.601
You ask too many questions!

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:56.728
You travel with a flock
of migrating birds.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.398
Go away. Excuse me! I am very busy.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.901
You tamed a fox. A fox like him!

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.111
Never had a pet.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:07.155
He wasn't your pet, he was your friend.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:10.325
Well, Does it look like
I have time for friends?

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:11.576
I'm working!

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:14.746
No!

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.916
That was my last brush!

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:21.086
I'm going to get fired.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.088
This was my last chance.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:27.009
This is so unfair!
I was just doing my job.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:30.178
- Actually, there's one more...
- Thank you.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.514
- Now I have to get back to work.
- Wait!

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:35.100
You know what?
You're slowing down my productivity!

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.519
You had a rose!

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.438
A what?

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.772
A rose.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.109
A really beautiful one. Miraculous even.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.445
One that was unique in all the world.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.323
You know, I've heard
quite enough of this nonsense.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.117
I have to work. Thank you.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.619
You've forgotten everything!

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.955
I'm very busy. with matters of consequence.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.623
You've become just another grown-up!

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.000
Give me that.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.005
No!

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.388
Why did you do that?

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.474
Why did you do...

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:19.311
It's all right, I don't need to cry.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:22.564
I don't need to cry.
I'm a grown-up. I'm a grown man.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:28.320
My brushes got knocked over.
I don't need to cr...

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.656
What will I do?

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:41.333
Blow.

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:48.256
Wait a minute, why are you so short?

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:51.093
- Are you really old?
- What?

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.762
No! I'm a child.

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:55.847
Just like you're supposed to be.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.432
You're a child?

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:01.103
Children are certainly
very, very, very odd.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:03.355
This is not good.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.191
I think I know someone who can help.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:11.863
Are you sure about this?

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.208
Mr. Prince,

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.919
what a pleasant surprise.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:31.424
This child needs your help.

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:33.218
Does she?

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.890
Here, we don't
normally allow little dogs.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.811
But for you, we will
make an exception, won't we?

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.273
Delightful.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.900
Come in, come in!

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.738
So how have you been? 
Hmm? Things good?

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.824
I love my job cleaning the roof.

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:58.118
Wonderful, wonderful.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:10.589
- Anything inessential...
- Must be made essential.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.632
Well done, Mr. Prince.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:21.057
You see, it's really a magnificent thing
the Businessman has created here.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:24.102
You might even call it a work of art.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.980
But of course, you'd be wrong.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.608
Very, Very wrong.

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:31.776
Nothing so trivial as that.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:32.944
My plane!

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:37.115
It's much more important.
Much more essential.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.368
No! Wait!

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.370
How could you?
You said you would help.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:43.622
"GRADUATES"

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.290
I am. That's how they helped me!

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.336
Mr. Prince!

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.464
It seems that
you've finally done something...

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.635
Let go.

01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:01.139
You will tell the Businessman?
How essential I've been?

01:16:01.349 --> 01:16:03.975
Yes, I most certainly will.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.021
The Businessman told me about this...

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:11.483
evidence of childhood
you brought with you.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.152
- Please! Those are important!
- No!

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:16.238
There is nothing essential in here at all.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.076
It is time

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.203
to grow up.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:26.998
"THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE
TO EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL"

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:30.919
How could everything essential
fit into just one book?

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.171
It is incredibly succinct.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.090
And single-spaced.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:40.178
So, what? I'm supposed to read this
over and over and over, until I'm old?

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:41.513
Not at all.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:46.685
Here, we take a more
accelerated approach to growing up.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.940
Isn't that right, Mr. Prince?

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.999
No, never mind.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:57.445
That blank look,
you've forgotten everything, haven't you?

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:08.123
Now, you're going to feel a slight pinch.
Just relax.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.375
Yes! Please sign there.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:13.003
A consent form releasing myself,
the Businessman,

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:15.338
- and the corporation from all liability...
- Help!

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:16.881
...in case of accidental death

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.718
or dismemberment during
the centralising process.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.928
I'm trying to help you!

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.723
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.059
Leave them!

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.981
I said, leave them!

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:36.318
Act your age, Mr. Prince!

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.820
Remember, you are
a graduate of my class.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:43.491
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.791
Return to your desk, please.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.344
Oh, I didn't think that through.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.847
The Businessman
is going to be very disappointed in me.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:08.933
Thank you. But why?

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:12.729
I never knew what this was,
or where I even got it,

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:15.190
but I thought maybe it was important...

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.067
Your sheep!

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.526
My sheep? Ha-ha.

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:20.987
I don't get it.

01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:23.031
The Aviator gave it to you

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.533
in the desert on Earth,
to eat the baobabs.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:28.036
- Catastrophe.
- Catastrophe.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.454
That's right.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.831
The Aviator drew all of these for you.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:36.294
- He really needs you right now.
- Me? He needs me?

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:43.551
Growing up is not
the problem. Forgetting is.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:48.890
I have an idea.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:51.976
We're just need... My plane!

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:56.356
There it is!

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:58.566
It's okay.

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:06.991
Hurry!

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:35.061
We did it!

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:41.526
Oh, No!

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.199
Which button?

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.540
No, no, no...

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.735
Yes!

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:27.906
We can catch it on top of the next pile!

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.241
Wait, where's Mr. Prince?

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:42.962
I remember these.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:45.757
The stars.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.425
What are they all doing here?

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:56.935
Look at the stars.
The stars are beautiful...

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.853
The stars are beautiful

01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:01.773
because of a flower
that cannot be seen.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:06.277
Because of a flower
that cannot be seen?

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:07.654
Your rose!

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.532
I have a rose...

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:14.035
I see you've found my collection,

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:19.332
501,622,731 stars.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.502
You? You did this?

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.671
But you're supposed
to just count the stars.

01:21:24.964 --> 01:21:29.551
Own! Say it with me.
Own. I own the stars.

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:33.888
Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:38.977
They used to be merely
little golden objects in the sky

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:42.564
that set lazy men to idle dreaming.

01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:47.485
But now, the stars
have finally been made essential.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:49.862
Where did you get that?

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:52.740
She's curious.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.826
Isn't that just like a child?

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.122
No!

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:00.248
Thank you.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.708
All right! Enough.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:04.002
- Thank you.
- All right!

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.170
Enough!

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:11.342
What are you going to do
with all the stars?

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:14.012
Don't worry, my little girl.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.431
I put the stars to good use.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:39.454
There. You see? The inessential has
become perfectly essential.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:42.540
How it should be for all things.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.375
Take her back to the classroom.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.210
Make sure no one interferes.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:49.714
- Stop it! Put me down. I can't...
- Stop wriggling!

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.717
- Don't let them do this to me.
- You're not gonna get away.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.053
- Wait.
- Wait?

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:58.473
I've given you 371 jobs,

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:01.601
and you have been fired
from 370 of them.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:05.396
I think it's time you get back to work,
my little failure.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.191
No! Please, Leave!

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:09.734
Stop wriggling.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:12.570
Stop!

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:15.573
- Take your hands off her.
- What? Stop?

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.910
I'm not a failure. I'm...

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:20.411
I'm the Little Prince.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:21.663
What?

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:26.999
He thinks he's little, and a prince!

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.131
Wonderful.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.717
Look at me! I'm a bumble bee.

01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:37.345
What are you? A duck?

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:43.935
He's hopeless.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:48.439
I'm not hopeless, I'm hopeful!

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.609
That's right! I'm full of hope!

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.028
And I love a rose!

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:56.489
And she loves me,
and she is waiting for me!

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.366
So...

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.284
I don't think I want to work
for you any more.

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.286
And um...

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:04.455
I quit!

01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:10.294
I quit!

01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:18.845
That pile!

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:26.811
When are you going to forget about
being a child?

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:28.521
Never!

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:32.483
Sorry, Mr. Prince!

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.320
No, it's my fault.
My face shouldn't have been there.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.572
Good.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:46.914
No.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:52.920
I'm scared.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.938
Hang on!

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.951
- I'll be right back!
- Where are you going?

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:26.370
Wait! Where are you going?

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.040
That's not good.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:40.802
I will grow up, but I'll never
be a grown-up like you!

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.066
Wow!

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:13.459
No!

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:21.926
Gotcha!

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:33.187
I got you, too.

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.718
Wonderful.

01:27:15.214 --> 01:27:18.999
This is very, very bad for business.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:23.696
That was amazing!

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:28.868
The stars are back.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.997
I forgot how beautiful they are.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.628
- Look! Asteroid 325!
- You remember!

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:40.338
And 326!

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:43.341
And 327!

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:44.967
And 328!

01:27:45.052 --> 01:27:46.677
It's working!

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.598
Look! B-612!

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.101
The baobabs.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.901
Your rose! She's there!

01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:04.195
Hold on!

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:06.530
You're not going to try and land,
are you?

01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:11.535
No, stop! Turn around! Stop!

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:21.128
What's happening?

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:24.048
Uh, we're falling.

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.886
- Where are you going now?
- Sit still.

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:53.661
Let's go.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.934
Over here! I found her!

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:23.899
Look.

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:26.485
My rose.

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:36.787
It's her.

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:07.318
No...

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:17.828
No, how can this be?

01:30:22.459 --> 01:30:24.668
I'm so sorry.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.672
You're supposed to be with her.

01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:35.346
I'm going to lose him, too.

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.642
And grow up.

01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:42.728
And forget all about him.

01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:46.899
Forget it all..

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:48.651
forever.

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:53.197
I don't want to lose him.

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:56.158
Don't cry.

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:02.373
How can you not be crying?

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:34.864
I can see her.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.373
She was not a common rose.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:48.752
She was the only one of her kind
in the whole universe.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:52.965
I remember her.

01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:55.050
I remember all of it.

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:56.760
She's not gone.

01:31:57.762 --> 01:31:58.888
She's still here?

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:00.681
It is only with the heart...

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:03.601
that one can see rightly.

01:32:08.607 --> 01:32:10.274
He'll always be with me.

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:13.611
I understand now.

01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:30.127
- Please tell the Aviator I remember him!
- I will!

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:32.171
Don't forget.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:33.672
I won't!

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:36.467
I won't forget any of it! I promise.

01:33:12.963 --> 01:33:14.088
Sweetie?

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:15.214
Yeah?

01:33:15.966 --> 01:33:18.175
- We're late.
- What?

01:33:18.635 --> 01:33:19.677
No, we're not.

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:22.179
We need to stop at the hospital
before school.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:31.855
122, 123, 124...

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.734
Okay.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:40.758
You're here.

01:34:43.595 --> 01:34:44.636
I'm sorry.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.557
I'm so sorry for what I said.

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:52.936
I don't even remember.

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:55.481
That's sweet.

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:59.234
No, I don't even remember who you are.

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:04.239
I got you, didn't I?

01:35:08.495 --> 01:35:10.788
I've got something to show you.

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:27.638
You did this?

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:37.314
All my drawings, all in order?

01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:44.154
This is so wonderful.

01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:51.495
Oh, Sweetheart.

01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:58.502
"You run the risk of weeping a little,
if you let yourself get tamed."

01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:08.053
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:18.814
Thank you.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:22.192
Did you see this?

01:36:29.576 --> 01:36:31.160
It's wonderful.

01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:33.662
Look. You see? That's the fox.

01:36:34.539 --> 01:36:35.914
My fox.

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:58.956
"The End"

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:58.390
You probably think
this is a hat, but it's not.
