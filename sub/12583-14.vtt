WEBVTT

00:33.033 --> 00:34.492
Okay, Dooley,

00:34.576 --> 00:36.619
let's hear about your science project.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.914
My potato grew eyes.

00:40.623 --> 00:44.377
I hope she likes...
"The Rocks of Rainey Street."

00:44.461 --> 00:45.754
It's all I could come up with

00:45.837 --> 00:47.005
on the way to the bus.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.339
-Sorry to interrupt.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.008
Just wanted to remind everyone to sign up

00:50.091 --> 00:51.634
for the "Fun Run" on Saturday.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.220
Have a good time and raise money
to buy the school

00:54.304 --> 00:56.014
somethin' nice or essential.

00:56.806 --> 00:59.267
I usually try not
to motivate kids this way,

00:59.350 --> 01:01.102
but if all your friends
are doin' something,

01:01.186 --> 01:02.854
shouldn't you be doin' it, too?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.023
Mm-hm...

01:09.486 --> 01:12.781
Nancy invited us
to a progressive dinner this Saturday.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.657
You know, where you eat a different course

01:14.741 --> 01:15.867
at each person's house?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.660
Well, that sounds pointless.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.745
Exactly.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.540
So I suggested a progressive breakfast!

01:22.624 --> 01:25.168
This Saturday, it'll be juice
at the Gribbles',

01:25.251 --> 01:26.878
eggs at the Souphanousinphones',

01:26.961 --> 01:28.838
and then back here for toast.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.257
Uh, wouldn't it be easier

01:31.341 --> 01:33.635
just to eat it all together someplace?

01:33.718 --> 01:35.970
We eat breakfast like that
every day, Hank,

01:36.054 --> 01:37.889
and frankly, it's getting old.

01:37.972 --> 01:38.890
Sorry, Mom.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.433
I can't make it Saturday.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.935
I'm running a 5K.

01:42.018 --> 01:42.852
You're what?

01:43.436 --> 01:47.148
Wait, is "running a 5K"
some kind of rap thing?

01:47.232 --> 01:48.066
No, Dad.

01:48.149 --> 01:51.319
It's a bunch of kids running
to raise money for the school.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.320
Well, that's great!

01:52.403 --> 01:53.988
When you cross that finish line,

01:54.072 --> 01:56.074
I'll be right there with the video camera.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.285
Even though it brings out
certain instincts in you.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.995
Oh... now you're both going?

02:01.079 --> 02:03.581
Fine. I will host the breakfast by myself,

02:03.665 --> 02:07.252
a breakfast that, apparently,
will not be videotaped.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.587
It's official.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.714
I need to start wearing suspenders.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.470
Mr. Boomhauer, how would you like
to sponsor me

02:17.554 --> 02:18.513
in the Fun Run?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.807
You would be sending
a positive message

02:20.890 --> 02:22.851
to the generation of today.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.896
Unless, of course, you want us
to start doing drugs.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.232
Goddang, man.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.109
Between ol' gettin' them
dang ol' Girl Scout cookies,

02:31.234 --> 02:32.152
and the band candy,

02:32.235 --> 02:33.862
don't, never gonna stop, man.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.572
Thank you, Mr. Boomhauer.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.657
Are you interested, Mr. Dauterive?

02:37.740 --> 02:39.242
Interested in what, Bobby?

02:39.325 --> 02:40.910
The stuff I just said.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.162
Tell it to me again.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.663
I like it when people talk to me.

02:43.746 --> 02:44.622
-Bill!
-Hm?

02:46.624 --> 02:47.876
Three dollars per.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.087
Sorry, I'm sponsoring Joseph.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.338
He's not running.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.381
Just the same.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.514
Check out this goodie bag!

03:01.598 --> 03:03.892
Sport gum, squishy ball,

03:03.975 --> 03:06.436
banana-nut protein bar...

03:06.519 --> 03:08.563
A Whattaburger headband!

03:08.646 --> 03:09.814
Well, the real "goodie"

03:09.898 --> 03:13.651
is that you raised $121
for your school, Bobby.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.528
You even got Joe Jack to pledge,

03:15.612 --> 03:17.280
and he doesn't even pay his alimony.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.700
Let's have all the kids
at the Fun Run starting line!

03:20.783 --> 03:22.285
Better line up now, son.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.204
I'll wait for you at the finish line.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.207
-Kids on your mark...
-Have fun!

03:27.290 --> 03:28.958
Get set... go!

03:51.481 --> 03:53.024
So proud of you, darling.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.528
Hey, Hank.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.489
You believe the things I do
for this school?

04:00.531 --> 04:01.407
Hank Hill.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.159
<i>Hi, Dad. Can you pick me up?</i>

04:03.243 --> 04:04.661
<i>I'm at the Mocha Bean.</i>

04:04.744 --> 04:05.870
The Mocha Bean?

04:05.954 --> 04:07.705
Right by the starting line?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.416
So you just quit.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.669
You didn't even make it one K?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.462
It's a "Fun Run," Dad.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.215
I ran until it stopped being fun.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.466
Happened quick.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.510
What about all the people
who sponsored you?

04:20.593 --> 04:21.886
Okay, how's this?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.055
Why don't you shoot some video of me

04:24.138 --> 04:25.848
running across the finish line?

04:25.932 --> 04:28.142
I'll just put my face over my latte

04:28.226 --> 04:29.644
so I'll work up a sweat.

04:29.727 --> 04:33.147
What has the MTV done to you, son?

04:35.233 --> 04:38.861
Wow, there sure was
a lot of toast left over.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.863
That is what happens when people decide

04:40.947 --> 04:42.407
to stuff themselves on juice.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.159
Bobby,

04:45.243 --> 04:46.536
this is a pedometer.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.246
It measures how far you walk.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.497
By the end of today,

04:49.580 --> 04:51.624
I want five kilometers on there.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.543
That's three-point-one miles.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.213
You know what I'd really love to do?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.257
Learn how to fix a car.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.258
Get moving.

05:06.931 --> 05:07.765
Hm...

05:15.023 --> 05:16.399
Feeling it in your calves now?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.693
That's ten isotonic massaging plates

05:18.776 --> 05:20.820
working at 3,000 pulses a minute.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.196
Yeah...

05:23.740 --> 05:25.658
You were gone all afternoon

05:25.742 --> 05:27.660
and you only walked a half a mile?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.955
Maybe when it gets to 100 miles,
it flips over.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.373
Get in the truck.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.796
Only two and a half miles to go!

05:39.797 --> 05:41.549
I'm chafing!

05:42.800 --> 05:44.052
Mmm...

05:47.805 --> 05:49.140
Great effort, runner!

05:49.223 --> 05:51.392
Sorry, Coach,
I'll get him out of your way.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.102
My son's a few hundred yards

05:53.186 --> 05:54.979
into being taught an important lesson.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.689
We'll finish up at the reservoir.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.194
I like the way
you were gutting it out out there.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.112
That's just the kind of guy
I want on my team.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.822
How'd you like to join track?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.032
On the team?

06:06.115 --> 06:08.993
Uh, Coach, this is the first time
you're seeing him.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.787
You might be getting the wrong idea.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.664
Yeah, I hurt my knee
putting my sneakers on.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.210
As long as you listen
and are willing to be taught,

06:17.293 --> 06:19.003
you'll always have a place in my system.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.380
You hear that, Bobby?

06:20.463 --> 06:22.173
You're gonna be part of a system!

06:24.926 --> 06:26.302
Look at those guys.

06:26.386 --> 06:30.139
They're gonna expect me to run
and compete and finish!

06:30.223 --> 06:32.350
I'm just gonna bring the whole team down!

06:32.433 --> 06:35.144
Bobby, the thing about
middle school athletes is

06:35.228 --> 06:36.604
they don't care if you win.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.147
They only care that you tried.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.904
I'm gonna try.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.869
Hey, Booby Hill, what are you doing here?

06:51.953 --> 06:53.913
The lunch room's that way!

06:53.996 --> 06:56.290
-Good one.
-Heh-heh...

06:56.374 --> 06:59.210
Well... it looks like
I'm your new teammate.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.545
-Huh?
-What?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.881
If you mess up, we'll mess you up.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.591
Track spikes are sharp

07:05.675 --> 07:08.094
and we're not afraid to use them.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.937
I know how you can
get kicked off the team.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.773
Take a javelin
and throw it into the crowd!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.860
I mean, it would do something.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.404
I better get down there.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.073
There are ten hurdles in the race,

07:29.157 --> 07:30.575
but the highest one

07:30.658 --> 07:31.826
is right here.

07:31.909 --> 07:32.910
Remember that.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.830
Hey, Hill, grab that shot put!

07:35.913 --> 07:36.956
Let's see what you've got.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.093
You sure you don't wanna cut me?

07:49.177 --> 07:51.554
Hill, track is like a picture puzzle.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.307
Sometimes the weird-looking piece
is the one you need.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.728
Yep. Bobby's gonna be wearing sweatpants

07:58.811 --> 08:00.021
for the right reason.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.397
Still, I must say,

08:01.481 --> 08:04.984
track and field doesn't
really seem like a full sport.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.112
It's more like leftover scraps
from other sports.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.908
Hey, Bobby, how was
your first day of practice?

08:11.991 --> 08:15.703
I'm really tired,
and I think all the guys hate me.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.247
Oh, they're just giving you
the business, Bobby.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.166
In football, we used to make the new kids

08:20.249 --> 08:21.751
breathe through Bill's sock.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.294
I was happy to contribute.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.253
And, oh, yeah.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.381
Boomhauer used to do this hilarious bit

08:27.465 --> 08:30.343
where he told me my mother died.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.430
Took the sting out of it
when she actually did.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.517
So the guys don't really hate me?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.310
That's right. Just hang in there,

08:39.393 --> 08:41.562
keep listening to your coach,
and do your best.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.064
You'll see. It'll pay off.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.023
Okay.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.736
Is there any lesson sports can't teach?

08:53.741 --> 08:56.744
If you want, I'll think of you
when I'm throwing.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.163
Wassanasong, you're throwing next.
Why aren't you warming up?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.624
Why get warm when I'm already hot?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.760
You're a 30-foot shot-putter
with a ten-foot mindset.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.679
You're out. Hill!

09:15.471 --> 09:17.765
What? Coach, it was a joke!

09:17.848 --> 09:19.016
A funny joke!

09:19.100 --> 09:20.726
Grab the shot put. You're throwing next.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.644
What?

09:21.727 --> 09:23.229
But you saw me throw!

09:30.653 --> 09:32.280
Landry, next thrower.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.823
It's easy, Hill.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.074
Visualize the action,

09:35.157 --> 09:36.909
then actualize the vision.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.578
Okay.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.788
Watch closely, Wassanasong.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.039
This isn't Hill's throw.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.374
It's your throw.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.386
All right, Hill!

09:57.722 --> 09:59.390
You blew it for us, Chane.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.184
Maybe your girlfriend wants
to see me kick your ass.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.021
...99, and 100.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.230
Okay, girl.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.440
Dad, we won!

10:07.523 --> 10:08.816
And I competed!

10:08.899 --> 10:10.693
I actually shot the put.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.361
Or did I put the shot?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.280
Either way, I threw it.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.573
Well, what did I tell you?

10:15.656 --> 10:17.241
You showed the coach you had heart,

10:17.325 --> 10:18.326
and he gave you a chance.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.454
I must have had more heart
than Chane Wassanasong

10:21.537 --> 10:23.414
'cause he sat on the bench.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.876
You competed while another guy
sat on the bench?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.003
There's a bottle of sport drink

10:29.086 --> 10:30.880
in the garage I've been saving.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.006
Let's open it.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.470
Hey, Chane, if this were an egg,

10:37.553 --> 10:40.514
it'd take some kind
of crazy bird to lay it!

10:40.598 --> 10:43.267
I'm trying to hyper-focus, okay?

10:45.269 --> 10:47.229
You're eating sugar
right before the hundred?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
Hill, sweats off!

11:01.786 --> 11:04.538
The finish line is inside of me.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.751
Now you've tasted chocolate and failure.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.002
Which is more bitter?

11:10.086 --> 11:13.339
Um... I like chocolate more than failure.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.341
So that means I should eat more chocolate?

11:15.424 --> 11:16.592
I... I don't understand.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.636
Understand this, gentlemen.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.347
Anytime, anywhere,
if I think someone's dogging it,

11:21.430 --> 11:22.473
he'll be "Bobby Hilled."

11:22.556 --> 11:25.434
Winning is the carrot,
and Bobby is the stick.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.145
Whew!

11:28.229 --> 11:29.855
I had to stop.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
They were putting up hurdles
for the next race.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.112
Hill, you're gonna take this team
to the District Finals.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.745
Boy, I sure wish I could have gone
to Bobby's meet today.

11:44.829 --> 11:48.416
Why do I always have
to be Mr. Strickland's character witness?

11:48.499 --> 11:50.251
Well, I think it's an honor.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.461
Mom, Dad, we won!

11:52.545 --> 11:53.587
I need some ice.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.257
My hand's sore from all the high-fiving.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.051
Great! Did the coach let you throw
the shot put again?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.470
Nah. I was busy doing the 440.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.097
You ran the 440?

12:03.180 --> 12:06.976
Coach said I'm a secret weapon
he can deploy anywhere.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.686
Oh, and guess what?

12:08.769 --> 12:10.020
I've got a nickname.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.648
The guys call me "The Stick."

12:12.732 --> 12:14.650
Sure. That's because you stuck it out.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.570
Yeah. I'm actually starting to have fun.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.529
That's right.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.781
See, I don't punish you
to make you miserable.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.324
I punish you to make you happy.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.826
I'm gettin' it!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.956
Jump long, long jumpers!

12:29.039 --> 12:31.417
Get some altitude, pole-vaulters!

12:33.043 --> 12:36.046
Boy, this sport does not lend itself
to good cheers.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.882
Hank, we have a situation.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.386
Bobby's doing the high hurdles?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.346
Sometimes it takes him two tries

12:44.430 --> 12:46.182
just to get on the couch.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.983
Oh, I can't watch.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.445
Oh, the humanity.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.242
I wasn't brought up
to second-guess a coach,

13:05.326 --> 13:07.286
but this makes no sense at all.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.038
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.998
You think Bobby's bad?

13:11.081 --> 13:13.042
Imagine if we had a child.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.759
I'd love him anyway.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.929
You're halfway home, Hill!

13:25.012 --> 13:27.223
Still think curfew is "bogus"?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.599
Excuse me, Coach Palmer?

13:28.682 --> 13:29.642
Don't worry, Mr. Hill.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.769
I've got Bobby working
on falling on his hands.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.521
You know, I'm not one of those dads

13:33.604 --> 13:36.273
who gets mad
if the coach doesn't play my son.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.443
Matter of fact, Bobby shouldn't
be anywhere near a hurdle.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.903
He's embarrassing himself.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.906
No, he's embarrassing
the guy he's replacing.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.576
You're using Bobby
to shame the good athletes?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.787
Since I started using Bobby as the Stick,

13:49.912 --> 13:51.831
the team's been on fire.

13:51.914 --> 13:52.957
We haven't lost a meet.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.376
Huh. Well, that sounds good,

13:55.459 --> 13:58.212
but it's making me feel kind of sick.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.005
All I know is, Bobby's teammates

14:00.089 --> 14:01.465
are setting personal bests,

14:01.549 --> 14:04.093
and we're headed for the District Finals.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.388
Excuse me. I just saw my pole vaulter
light a cigarette.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.807
Hill, forget the hurdles! Pole vault!

14:10.224 --> 14:11.350
I'm on it.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.354
How was that?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.362
Well, I guess it's nice that the coach

14:23.445 --> 14:25.489
calls Bobby his "go-to guy,"

14:25.573 --> 14:28.075
but... feels like one of those fairy tales

14:28.158 --> 14:29.451
where the genie gives you a wish,

14:29.535 --> 14:32.079
but you ask for it
in slightly the wrong way

14:32.162 --> 14:34.915
and you end up
with a solid gold head or something.

14:34.999 --> 14:39.295
The correct strategy with genies
is to wish for more wishes.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.504
It just seems wrong.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.047
Nothing's expected of him.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.757
Bobby never did pole vault.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.634
He just limbo'd under the bar.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.470
In a way, life was simpler

14:48.554 --> 14:51.891
when Bobby was making collages
out of <i>People</i> magazine.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.603
Hey, Dad. I'm carbo-loading.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.937
Yeah, uh...

14:57.021 --> 14:58.147
Here's the thing.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.523
Bobby, do you understand

14:59.607 --> 15:01.650
why the coach is playing you so much?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.110
'Course I do, Dad.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.238
My input delta yields, you know, a tangent

15:06.322 --> 15:08.574
to a winning hypotenuse or something.

15:08.657 --> 15:12.328
Well, it's mostly
because you're really bad.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.622
The other guys try harder

15:14.705 --> 15:17.833
so they aren't humiliated
by being replaced by you.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.753
I knew I was contributing.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.838
I just wasn't sure how.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.007
I'm a motivator!

15:25.090 --> 15:26.926
I'm like a big Rally Monkey.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.970
Bobby, you don't motivate anyone
by being lousy.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.848
You motivate 'em
by giving a heartbreaking speech

15:32.932 --> 15:34.224
or dying or something.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.102
You know, I'm thinking
you should quit this team.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.647
Quit the team I brought to the finals?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.023
No way!

15:41.106 --> 15:44.276
Oh, by the way,
tomorrow night's the letter ceremony.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.445
I need $90 for the jacket.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.821
$90?

15:47.905 --> 15:49.949
I went for the leather sleeves.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.743
<i>Ramón Alejandro.</i>

15:54.912 --> 15:58.248
Hank, I bet this reminds you
of when you got your letter.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.375
Oh, sure.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.126
Only I led the league in rushing

16:01.210 --> 16:03.754
and sacrificed all the cartilage
in my knees.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.422
Other than that, déjà vu.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.424
Gary Anderson.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.636
Dad, I know what I wanna do
with my life...

16:10.719 --> 16:12.805
be a professional motivator.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.392
I just need to find a field
in which I have no potential.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.351
Hmm...

16:17.893 --> 16:20.145
I'd make a terrible dam builder.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.648
Why don't you just try
to be good at something?

16:22.731 --> 16:25.859
Don't try to motivate a motivator, Dad.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.696
And the man who brought us
to the District Finals...

16:28.779 --> 16:29.738
Bobby Hill!

16:32.282 --> 16:33.742
Excuse me.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.958
Stick! Stick! Stick! Stick!

17:00.060 --> 17:01.061
Whoa!

17:05.941 --> 17:07.276
What do you think, Coach?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.695
Any sprinters acting lackadaisical?

17:09.778 --> 17:11.697
High jumpers showing enough grit?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.657
Everyone's brought their "A" game, Bobby,

17:13.741 --> 17:14.742
because of you.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.703
The Stick'll be taking a nap
if you need him.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.998
Well, the meet's almost over.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.625
I wonder if Bobby's
gonna humiliate anyone...

17:23.709 --> 17:24.835
besides himself.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.378
There's Bobby. Look, right there.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.464
Oh!

17:28.547 --> 17:31.508
He's curled up
in his little letterman's jacket.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.926
He's sleeping?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.595
Damn it, that does it.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.765
Wake up, Bobby.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.891
We're going home.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.644
But the team needs me.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.730
Is there a problem, Mr. Hill?

17:44.813 --> 17:45.939
Yeah, there is.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.692
A real coach brings out
the best in his players.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.696
A jackass puts his worst guy
on display like it's a sideshow.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.492
In the future, when every team
has a designated "Bobby Hill,"

17:56.575 --> 17:57.951
and I'm in the Track Hall of Fame,

17:58.035 --> 17:59.286
maybe you'll feel differently.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.288
There's a Track Hall of Fame?

18:02.456 --> 18:03.791
The relay is about to start.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.667
We take this, we win the meet.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.627
Coach...

18:06.710 --> 18:09.004
I hyper-extended
and I can't run the relay.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.048
-You what?
-I stretched too hard.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.508
I saw you talking to the Stick,

18:12.591 --> 18:14.760
and I got scared I was
gonna get Bobby Hilled.

18:14.843 --> 18:15.928
Landry!

18:16.011 --> 18:18.097
I need a runner or you're disqualified.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.682
Murphy's still long-jumping.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.976
-I... I don't see Chane...
-Landry!

18:23.060 --> 18:24.770
I... I don't, I don't have anyone left.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.897
I... I never envisioned a no-sub scenario.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.940
You don't have to.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.691
You've got Bobby. You can put him in.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.609
-What?
-What?

18:32.986 --> 18:34.988
This isn't a Stick situation.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.533
Failing would actually hurt us here.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.035
Okay. Okay, I can do this.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.622
Hill, any good paradigm can be inverted.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.873
Imagine another you.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.751
We'll call that
"Bobby Hill sub-negative one..."

18:47.835 --> 18:49.878
Forget about that nonsense, Bobby.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.672
You just have to do two things.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.882
Move this leg, then move that one,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.801
and don't quit until the race is over.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.010
You can do it, Bobby.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.095
You can try.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.370
<i>It's Tom Landry in the lead!</i>

19:35.716 --> 19:38.468
One foot... in front of the other.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.815
I wish Bobby wasn't such a butterfingers.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.277
Bobby! Pretend the baton is the remote!

20:00.908 --> 20:01.742
Ho, yeah!

20:01.825 --> 20:05.120
<i>With one leg to go,
it's Tom Landry's to lose!</i>

20:06.788 --> 20:07.831
<i>Maybe not.</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:24.348
Keep going, Bobby!
Don't lay down with them!

20:29.686 --> 20:32.189
<i>The Landry runner
is the only one still on his feet.</i>

20:42.491 --> 20:44.076
<i>Landry wins!</i>

20:44.159 --> 20:46.245
Bobby! All right, Bobby!

20:46.328 --> 20:47.913
-Yeah, you're the Stick!
-All right! Yeah!

20:47.996 --> 20:48.914
You did it!

20:48.997 --> 20:50.916
That's how you motivate a team.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.046
Well, Bobby, you lost a huge lead,

20:56.129 --> 20:58.840
and it took a bunch of guys
falling down, but you did it.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.093
I think I'm gonna throw up.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.345
Go ahead, son. You've earned it.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.183
I'm serious, guys.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.851
You don't wanna be under me.
