WEBVTT

02:14.169 --> 02:16.605
Look, baby!

02:16.637 --> 02:17.872
Ocean.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.740
Ah, ocean.

02:27.482 --> 02:29.284
Oh, man.

02:40.128 --> 02:42.464
Teach me how to surf, mommy!

02:43.298 --> 02:45.534
We're not gonna be there
that long.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.082
How'ya do?

03:03.618 --> 03:05.920
Here you go, man.

03:05.953 --> 03:06.854
God bless.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.523
Good luck.

03:08.557 --> 03:09.524
Have a good one.

03:09.558 --> 03:10.791
- Have a great day.
- You too.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.160
Happy new year!

03:15.130 --> 03:18.233
Oh, Malibu.

03:19.568 --> 03:21.436
Nice place to be homeless.

03:33.648 --> 03:36.017
Look at these houses.

03:36.051 --> 03:37.718
This is crazy.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.653
Oh, man.

03:38.687 --> 03:39.954
How did she score a place here?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.729
This is it.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.830
You ready?

04:02.510 --> 04:05.280
- Mr. Bannett.
- Hi.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.548
Hi.

04:06.581 --> 04:08.450
You're so lucky, you know
the fire was contained,

04:08.483 --> 04:10.185
so there's no structural damage.

04:10.218 --> 04:11.286
It's got great bones.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.955
And of course,
you can't beat the location.

04:14.989 --> 04:17.858
I know a couple of developers
who would jump all over this.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.461
Oh, thank you, but uh,
we're actually gonna do

04:19.494 --> 04:20.995
the work ourselves.

04:21.029 --> 04:22.564
Oh.

04:22.597 --> 04:24.965
Well, we need to clear
the brush.

04:24.999 --> 04:29.304
Yeah, let's just uh, let's just
worry about the inside.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.640
Okay, well, best of luck.

04:31.673 --> 04:33.308
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.177
Uh, quick question, what...

04:36.211 --> 04:38.246
Okay.

04:40.282 --> 04:42.584
Okay, here we go.

05:19.154 --> 05:20.988
God, it was never this bad.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.448
Honey, don't.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.432
When you said
we could live on site,

06:04.466 --> 06:06.568
you didn't mention the smell.

06:26.887 --> 06:31.693
This may be the best thing
my mother ever gifted me.

06:32.627 --> 06:36.731
That is a $6-million-view.

06:36.765 --> 06:39.033
But what's the land worth?

06:59.053 --> 07:01.289
Oh my God.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.687
Oh my God.

07:40.495 --> 07:42.230
Ugh.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.369
We just stick to the plan,
okay?

07:48.403 --> 07:50.872
No more flipping row-houses.

07:50.905 --> 07:55.910
We build our dream home,
we have kids, we retire.

07:55.944 --> 07:59.781
But what if we can't sell it
right away?

07:59.814 --> 08:00.882
Really?

08:00.915 --> 08:03.017
I'm sorry, have you...
have you met that view?

08:03.051 --> 08:04.686
Again with the view.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.187
Is that all you got?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.761
Mom, I'm home.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.243
Hey.

09:09.784 --> 09:11.185
Should have tried harder.

09:11.219 --> 09:13.054
Babe, don't.

09:15.757 --> 09:17.325
Even if you'd found her
the right facility,

09:17.358 --> 09:18.960
she wouldn't have gone.

09:22.397 --> 09:25.733
I know it's hard, honey.

09:25.767 --> 09:29.203
When my mom died, I cried
in the shower for a year.

09:32.507 --> 09:34.576
I love you so much.

09:37.345 --> 09:39.147
I love you, too.

10:16.451 --> 10:18.553
Hey, Gary.

10:18.586 --> 10:20.188
Come here, baby.

10:26.894 --> 10:30.465
I'm sorry, Gary,
your mom's a loser.

10:33.635 --> 10:35.803
Oh, you're my baby.

10:45.179 --> 10:46.214
Hey!

10:46.247 --> 10:48.416
I'm Joan, if you need anything,
just let me know.

10:48.449 --> 10:51.185
Okay, thank you.

10:51.219 --> 10:52.587
I just got these in.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.622
Hand-blown.

10:54.656 --> 10:56.824
My customers rave about them.

10:56.858 --> 10:58.226
From south of the border.

10:58.259 --> 10:59.360
What do you think?

11:01.262 --> 11:02.230
Oh yeah, that works.

11:02.263 --> 11:03.464
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:03.498 --> 11:05.299
I'll take two of these please.

11:06.234 --> 11:07.201
Well, thank you,
my wife's gonna love 'em.

11:07.235 --> 11:09.237
Yeah, yeah.

11:09.270 --> 11:11.305
Alright, stick it in.

11:11.339 --> 11:12.373
Oh, right.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.012
And I need to see your I.D.

11:17.046 --> 11:19.447
Right, yeah of course, sorry.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.782
Here you go.

11:22.984 --> 11:24.552
So you're the guy that
just moved into the house

11:24.585 --> 11:27.056
on Paradise Cove?

11:27.089 --> 11:28.289
I'm the guy.

11:30.391 --> 11:32.727
Have you met Bree yet?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.096
Uh, Bree who?

11:39.101 --> 11:42.603
You know what, take another
bottle of this on the house.

11:42.637 --> 11:43.504
Really?

11:43.538 --> 11:45.140
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

11:46.607 --> 11:48.010
Thank you.

12:02.623 --> 12:04.059
Honey?

12:11.432 --> 12:13.267
What the hell?

12:43.998 --> 12:45.466
They're beautiful, but...

12:46.601 --> 12:48.736
You're welcome.

12:48.770 --> 12:50.072
You were gonna get lucky
any way.

12:50.105 --> 12:53.242
You really didn't have to.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.576
Okay, well,
I'll just take 'em back.

12:55.610 --> 12:57.112
I'll send 'em back to Turkey.

13:01.883 --> 13:04.418
- You need more.
- No, no, I'm good.

13:04.452 --> 13:06.754
Oh, come on, keep going.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.589
No one likes a quitter.

13:08.623 --> 13:10.259
- Alright.
- Move.

13:11.392 --> 13:13.961
I'll give you just... just enough
to match me.

13:13.995 --> 13:16.497
Alright, that's good.

13:16.531 --> 13:17.999
- That's good.
- How about...

13:18.033 --> 13:20.635
That's good.

13:20.668 --> 13:23.704
You don't have to do anything.

13:23.738 --> 13:24.806
Mmm.

13:26.407 --> 13:27.875
No more for the night.

13:29.610 --> 13:32.281
Mmm.

13:32.313 --> 13:33.881
Hear that?

13:33.915 --> 13:35.716
It's like living on a boat.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.052
Yeah.

13:44.358 --> 13:45.260
Hello.

13:45.294 --> 13:46.261
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:59.308 --> 14:01.542
More eggs than a hen house.

14:03.945 --> 14:05.947
Yeah, more targets.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.049
- Hmm.
- Mhmm.

14:07.082 --> 14:08.482
Wanna hit my target?

14:08.516 --> 14:10.085
I do.

15:54.622 --> 15:56.757
Can't beat this view.

16:11.672 --> 16:15.576
Well, listen um,

16:15.609 --> 16:18.479
you can always put up
"No Trespassing" signs.

16:18.512 --> 16:19.680
Does that work?

16:19.714 --> 16:22.850
Uh, it depends on who you are.

16:22.883 --> 16:24.986
Look, normally
with the homeless,

16:25.020 --> 16:26.321
half of them are on drugs,

16:26.355 --> 16:29.523
and the other half are
out of their minds.

16:29.557 --> 16:31.159
The city does nothing.

16:31.193 --> 16:33.661
They wanna give them access.

16:33.694 --> 16:35.896
Got nowhere else to put them.

16:35.930 --> 16:38.100
But Bree is different.

16:38.133 --> 16:43.105
Yeah, she's lived here
a long time.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.307
Well, we live here now.

16:45.340 --> 16:48.143
Yeah, and we're about to do
a major renovation.

16:48.176 --> 16:53.914
Yeah, well, you are always free
to uh, clean up

16:53.948 --> 16:55.549
your own property.

16:57.585 --> 16:58.886
Night, folks.

16:58.919 --> 16:59.987
Excuse me.

17:00.022 --> 17:02.424
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

17:02.457 --> 17:05.060
- Watch your head.
- Yep.

17:05.093 --> 17:06.794
Oh boy, good luck.

17:10.931 --> 17:12.034
Honey, what are you doing?

17:12.067 --> 17:14.635
Well, I'm cleaning up
our own property.

17:18.873 --> 17:19.874
Alright.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.675
It's not too much stuff
to remove.

17:27.249 --> 17:28.916
What the hell?

17:28.949 --> 17:31.685
Who took my stuff?

17:31.719 --> 17:33.621
Criminals!

17:34.722 --> 17:36.491
Shit!

17:37.092 --> 17:38.826
That must be the lady.

17:45.467 --> 17:46.268
What?

17:46.301 --> 17:48.836
Well, I don't wanna
go down there.

17:48.869 --> 17:50.305
Oh.

17:50.338 --> 17:52.907
Go deal with her please.

17:52.940 --> 17:55.010
I can't.

17:55.043 --> 17:58.413
Alright, alright.

17:58.447 --> 17:59.613
Babe.

18:08.123 --> 18:10.492
Hey.

18:10.525 --> 18:13.828
So uh, this is a...
a private beach.

18:21.002 --> 18:22.337
I know.

18:22.370 --> 18:24.372
I got married on this beach.

18:29.544 --> 18:31.413
Supposed to be access points
all along here,

18:31.446 --> 18:34.615
but beach hoarders
don't like to share the sand.

18:34.648 --> 18:37.952
So they go out of their way
lock entrances and post signs

18:37.985 --> 18:40.721
just to keep trespassers
off the beach.

18:42.457 --> 18:46.561
Ever since the railroad barons
stole it from the Chumash,

18:46.595 --> 18:49.630
Malibu's been trying
to keep out interlopers.

18:50.898 --> 18:56.538
But if history teaches us
nothing,

18:56.571 --> 18:58.672
you can't...

18:58.706 --> 19:03.411
You can't... you can't own
nature's bounty.

19:03.445 --> 19:06.448
Ocean eats away at everything.

19:06.481 --> 19:09.717
I'm only 22 years old.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.755
Look, just so you know,

19:14.788 --> 19:17.658
there's gonna be a lot of people
working here.

19:19.860 --> 19:25.733
Ah, the hubris of building
on the temporary.

19:25.766 --> 19:30.005
Rising sea levels, erosion,
wild fires.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.374
Even the hills could come down
on you at any moment.

19:32.407 --> 19:37.778
And where does the pigeon
decide to build his nest?

19:42.250 --> 19:46.720
But it's the fragility that
makes it valuable.

19:46.754 --> 19:50.025
And you wanna build
your identity around owning

19:50.058 --> 19:53.228
this fragile thing,

19:53.261 --> 19:55.096
but your identity
is the most fragile thing

19:55.130 --> 19:56.598
that you own.

20:04.939 --> 20:08.842
You just... you can't live
in a construction zone.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.412
Aren't you staying?

20:12.713 --> 20:16.717
Yeah, but the point is
it's just... it's not safe.

20:16.750 --> 20:21.523
Hmm, now you sound like
your mother, Knox.

20:24.892 --> 20:29.364
You know, it's funny, Patricia
never mentioned having a son.

20:33.468 --> 20:37.005
How was she, in the end?

20:38.373 --> 20:44.246
Desperate, isolated, lonely.

20:47.549 --> 20:50.318
It was sad that she never got
the help she needed.

20:52.354 --> 20:54.788
Suffering alone like that.

20:56.591 --> 20:58.493
Look, I don't know
what happened between you two,

20:58.526 --> 21:02.464
but it's mine now.

21:04.099 --> 21:06.067
I have the deed.

21:06.101 --> 21:09.137
You have the deed, Knox.

21:09.170 --> 21:12.773
You got yourself
a piece of paper!

21:14.476 --> 21:18.446
But did you think about
who had to fail

21:18.480 --> 21:20.448
for you to succeed?

21:21.583 --> 21:24.352
Or is that just
the Bannett family way?

21:27.555 --> 21:29.758
Uh, you... you probably have
some family.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.992
Do you have family around here?

21:32.027 --> 21:33.827
Yeah.

21:33.861 --> 21:35.263
My son, Roman.

21:35.297 --> 21:36.231
Great.

21:36.264 --> 21:37.065
How about I call him?

21:37.098 --> 21:38.733
Can I call him?

21:46.308 --> 21:47.342
Oh.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.111
Oh hey, please don't, don't...
okay.

21:50.145 --> 21:51.945
Hey, hey, you're okay,
you're okay.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.814
You're okay.

21:53.847 --> 21:56.084
Just...

21:56.117 --> 21:58.019
I'm sorry.

21:58.053 --> 22:03.058
It's just... it's been a while,
I'm not used to...

22:04.726 --> 22:07.195
Listen, I'm just trying to help.

22:07.228 --> 22:10.931
Could you get me a glass
of filtered water

22:10.964 --> 22:11.999
from the house?

22:12.033 --> 22:13.802
My mug is over there.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.807
Uh, yeah.

22:18.839 --> 22:19.873
Sure.

22:23.244 --> 22:24.713
Mmm.

22:40.628 --> 22:41.830
Hmm.

22:47.335 --> 22:48.002
There you go.

22:48.036 --> 22:49.903
Oh, hmm.

22:53.541 --> 23:00.981
You know, there are a uh,
ton of shelters around.

23:01.015 --> 23:02.617
With this view?

23:04.419 --> 23:07.122
Um, yeah, here.

23:11.059 --> 23:12.193
What's this?

23:12.227 --> 23:16.064
That... that is for you,
to find a new place to live.

23:20.502 --> 23:21.836
So we're good?

23:24.339 --> 23:25.740
No.

23:29.611 --> 23:31.646
We're wonderful!

23:34.849 --> 23:36.050
Okay.

23:40.188 --> 23:41.723
Hey, Knox...

23:44.159 --> 23:46.127
I could taste the hose.

23:50.931 --> 23:52.167
Okay.

24:12.420 --> 24:13.987
Yeah, thank you.

24:14.022 --> 24:15.190
Another developer?

24:16.324 --> 24:18.793
Kids on your
hand, can't eat lunch.

24:18.827 --> 24:20.295
Inspector.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.930
Hey, what you got for me?

24:21.962 --> 24:23.431
Treasure map?

24:23.465 --> 24:25.400
Always.

24:25.433 --> 24:29.204
Alright, 26270 Paradise Cove.

24:29.237 --> 24:30.905
- It's a special property.
- Comes with something extra.

24:30.939 --> 24:33.074
Mhmm, mhmm.

24:36.644 --> 24:38.146
Private beach.

24:38.179 --> 24:39.614
Alright, let's see.

24:39.647 --> 24:41.149
We got a one bedroom,
one bath here.

24:41.182 --> 24:44.285
Uh no, it's actually a...
a two bedroom, two bath.

24:44.319 --> 24:45.854
Not according to zoning.

24:45.887 --> 24:48.423
You gotta convert it back
to get a permit.

24:48.456 --> 24:50.458
What?
No.

24:50.492 --> 24:51.726
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:51.759 --> 24:54.496
No, we... we can't do...

24:54.529 --> 24:56.464
Uh, can't you guys
look the other way?

24:56.498 --> 24:57.832
Or...

24:57.866 --> 24:59.534
All you flippers say that.

25:00.935 --> 25:03.271
Look, it's my mom's house, okay?

25:03.304 --> 25:04.939
I'm gonna be in and out.

25:04.973 --> 25:07.609
Look, if it's liveable,
you might wanna think on it.

25:07.642 --> 25:09.177
How's the surf, Griff?

25:09.210 --> 25:10.278
Fsss.

25:10.311 --> 25:12.213
Alright, give me 10, bro.

25:12.247 --> 25:13.147
Yes, sir.

25:13.181 --> 25:14.949
Have a good day.

25:24.092 --> 25:25.126
Come on!

25:25.159 --> 25:26.694
Fuck!

25:27.996 --> 25:31.332
How can I get $6 million
out of a one bedroom house?

25:31.366 --> 25:32.667
You can't.

25:34.502 --> 25:36.104
Personally, I'd unload it.

25:38.172 --> 25:39.440
Griff, come on.

25:39.474 --> 25:41.276
You gotta help me out here.

25:41.309 --> 25:46.447
Nah man, I don't like
doing un-permitted work, dude.

25:46.481 --> 25:47.682
Fine.

25:59.227 --> 26:01.696
How do you feel about cash?

26:01.729 --> 26:06.067
I feel like your house
will be done in six weeks.

26:07.702 --> 26:09.270
- Alright.
- Alright.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.375
Don't get wet,
we're leaving soon.

26:14.409 --> 26:15.877
That's a good boy.

26:17.612 --> 26:19.647
Oh, sweetie,
I think this is her.

26:23.251 --> 26:24.652
Hey!

26:24.686 --> 26:25.920
You're our new neighbour!

26:27.355 --> 26:29.357
Hi!

26:29.390 --> 26:30.758
- I'm Tracey.
- Pam.

26:30.792 --> 26:31.659
This is my husband Mike.

26:31.693 --> 26:33.328
Hey there.

26:33.361 --> 26:35.730
It's so nice to have
a young couple move in.

26:35.763 --> 26:38.600
When we first got here,
3 million years ago,

26:38.633 --> 26:40.902
this street was all
full-time residents.

26:40.935 --> 26:42.637
Now they're second homes.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.772
Wow.

26:44.806 --> 26:46.240
Where are you from?

26:46.274 --> 26:48.142
Uh, Detroit.

26:48.176 --> 26:49.377
Oh, that's funny.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.613
The last owner
was from Michigan.

26:51.646 --> 26:53.147
Total nightmare.

26:54.916 --> 26:56.918
When do you think
you'll be finished?

26:56.951 --> 26:59.787
Babies can hear sounds
in the womb.

26:59.821 --> 27:01.356
Is it your first?

27:01.389 --> 27:02.490
Fifth.

27:02.523 --> 27:04.659
- Wow.
- I know.

27:04.692 --> 27:06.361
He doesn't even need to be
in the same room.

27:08.630 --> 27:10.531
You must have started it early.

27:10.565 --> 27:12.101
Not really.

27:12.133 --> 27:13.601
She's 32.

27:13.635 --> 27:14.669
It's time to replace me.

27:16.571 --> 27:18.306
You got any kids?

27:18.339 --> 27:20.274
Uh, no.

27:21.643 --> 27:23.678
Oh, that's too bad,
they're really fun.

27:28.516 --> 27:31.486
See you around, Tracey.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.454
Nice to meet you.

27:43.331 --> 27:44.699
What are you doing?

27:44.732 --> 27:46.300
You don't wanna skimp
on finishes.

27:46.334 --> 27:48.536
It is Malibu.

27:48.569 --> 27:50.405
Where'd you go to design school?

27:51.606 --> 27:53.241
Ah, here it is.

27:53.274 --> 27:55.443
Cararra marble.

27:55.476 --> 27:56.778
Yeah.

27:56.811 --> 27:59.213
My husband will be back
any minute.

27:59.247 --> 28:01.649
Right.

28:01.683 --> 28:03.251
When you're rich,
you're eccentric.

28:03.284 --> 28:06.354
When you're poor,
you're just plain crazy.

28:06.387 --> 28:08.489
Will you give me my dog!

28:09.457 --> 28:12.127
You know, bad luck
is not bad character.

28:12.161 --> 28:15.196
I'm a good person,
once you get to know me.

28:15.229 --> 28:17.465
Not like your grifter
mother-in-law.

28:17.498 --> 28:19.267
Excuse me?

28:19.300 --> 28:22.637
What, you never asked Knox
how mommy scored

28:22.670 --> 28:25.640
a beach house in Malibu?

28:25.673 --> 28:28.110
Connect the dots, Tracey.

28:28.143 --> 28:30.778
Patricia moved in,
stopped paying rent,

28:30.812 --> 28:34.682
while she was secretly paying
my property taxes.

28:34.716 --> 28:37.285
That's right...
I didn't know

28:37.318 --> 28:40.855
I lost my own house
until your squatter-in-law

28:40.888 --> 28:43.357
showed up
with the goddamn deed.

28:45.060 --> 28:47.795
Oh, should I lock up?

29:00.942 --> 29:02.977
I wanna call the sheriff again.

29:03.011 --> 29:05.513
No, honey,
the sheriff can't come here.

29:05.546 --> 29:06.814
Why not?

29:11.053 --> 29:13.988
Because we're not doing this
permitted.

29:14.022 --> 29:15.757
Are you kidding me?

29:17.759 --> 29:19.393
Good luck with that.

29:20.962 --> 29:25.134
Knox, she's squatting
under her own house.

29:27.268 --> 29:29.771
You never asked your mother
how she got it?

29:32.807 --> 29:34.509
I thought it'd be different
this time.

29:36.277 --> 29:37.979
This time.

29:39.347 --> 29:40.314
Oh, I get it.

29:40.348 --> 29:42.283
This is what she did.

29:42.316 --> 29:43.985
How she raised you.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.423
I was a kid,
I didn't know any better.

29:49.457 --> 29:50.858
30-fucking-9, Knox!

29:50.892 --> 29:53.028
And I'm your wife.

29:53.061 --> 29:54.896
Why didn't you tell me?

29:58.432 --> 29:59.901
I didn't want you to think
I was like her.

29:59.934 --> 30:01.203
No, you're not like her, Knox.

30:01.236 --> 30:02.870
You're worse.

30:02.904 --> 30:04.806
I'm taking the truck.

30:11.412 --> 30:12.814
Can uh...

30:24.959 --> 30:28.362
Yeah, here we go, yeah.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.701
Are you guys still having lunch?

30:33.734 --> 30:34.936
We gotta finish that framing.

30:36.404 --> 30:37.605
What's that?

30:41.776 --> 30:42.877
Let me see that.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.392
Did you find that under there?

30:58.426 --> 31:00.661
Under there... uh yeah.

31:00.695 --> 31:02.396
Alright, I'll take care of it.

31:26.721 --> 31:28.656
What can I get you, Bree?

31:28.689 --> 31:29.857
Oh, hi.

31:29.891 --> 31:32.261
Uh, 3 pounds of the sirloin
please.

31:33.561 --> 31:35.364
Nice.

31:36.564 --> 31:38.733
We just love grass-fed beef.

31:38.766 --> 31:41.236
So good with just butter
and salt.

31:41.270 --> 31:44.939
No fussy bordelaise sauce
to junk it up, you know?

31:44.972 --> 31:46.641
Always the best.

31:46.674 --> 31:48.010
Thank you.

31:48.043 --> 31:49.111
Have a good one.

32:47.402 --> 32:49.171
Not again!

33:03.684 --> 33:04.319
Hi, honey.

33:04.353 --> 33:05.187
Hi.

33:07.788 --> 33:10.025
Did you give her money?

33:10.058 --> 33:12.927
Yeah, so she could find
a place to live.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.263
Well, she spent it on
$50 steaks!

33:16.365 --> 33:18.333
What are you spying on her?

33:18.367 --> 33:20.102
I was shopping for groceries.

33:20.135 --> 33:22.870
And are you seriously
taking her side?

33:22.903 --> 33:25.040
No, I'm not taking her side,
but honey,

33:25.073 --> 33:26.574
have a little compassion.

33:26.607 --> 33:28.010
Why?

33:28.043 --> 33:30.578
'Cause she looks like that?

33:30.611 --> 33:31.512
What?

33:31.545 --> 33:34.082
Oh, come on!

33:34.116 --> 33:35.583
You haven't noticed
that underneath all that,

33:35.616 --> 33:37.052
she's fucking hot?

33:39.520 --> 33:42.590
Honey, she's a middle-aged
homeless woman,

33:42.623 --> 33:45.593
living under our house
and she will leave, trust me.

33:51.665 --> 33:53.201
Gary!

34:03.111 --> 34:04.678
Dog rules.

34:06.148 --> 34:09.717
- Can't leave any holes.
- Okay.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.353
No huecos.

34:11.386 --> 34:12.686
- No problema.
- No... no problema.

34:12.720 --> 34:13.388
Pardon.

34:13.422 --> 34:15.956
Hey, we... we can't let Gary out.

34:15.990 --> 34:17.625
If he's not in his crate...

34:17.658 --> 34:19.727
He's on his leash.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.264
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:22.297 --> 34:23.697
Alright Nick,
hey, vamanos.

34:23.731 --> 34:25.233
Let's go, let's pack it up.

34:27.768 --> 34:28.903
Guys, thank you.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.072
No problema, huh.

34:30.105 --> 34:32.973
Hey, hey, where do you think
you're going?

34:33.008 --> 34:34.942
I'm ovulating.

34:34.975 --> 34:38.413
- Oh, oh, say no more.
- Okay.

34:43.185 --> 34:45.619
Joan, I come in peace!

34:45.653 --> 34:47.055
Are you here?

34:47.089 --> 34:48.256
Bree...

34:50.292 --> 34:52.427
No trespassing.

34:52.461 --> 34:53.594
Oh my God.

34:53.627 --> 34:56.897
Bree, what are you...
what are you doing here?

34:56.931 --> 34:58.200
Oh my God, there's a bug.

34:58.233 --> 35:00.601
Are you... are you living here?

35:00.634 --> 35:01.735
What are you doing?

35:04.406 --> 35:06.841
You have to pull yourself
together, Bree.

35:06.874 --> 35:08.976
You're broken.

35:09.010 --> 35:12.147
You wanna fix something,
fix your car.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.515
Okay, okay.

35:13.548 --> 35:16.617
Bree... Bree, everybody
is trying to help you.

35:16.650 --> 35:18.320
Everybody.

35:18.353 --> 35:20.322
Look, I... I will... I... I...

35:20.355 --> 35:21.689
I'll put you...
I will get you

35:21.722 --> 35:23.358
a 72-hour psych hold.

35:23.391 --> 35:26.495
Maybe you can talk to somebody,
but I can't do anything

35:26.528 --> 35:28.296
if you're not gonna
help yourself, Bree.

35:28.330 --> 35:30.432
You gotta help yourself,
do you understand me?

35:32.167 --> 35:33.602
Okay.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.827
- That'll work.
- Yeah?

36:33.861 --> 36:34.962
Oh yeah.

36:36.565 --> 36:37.965
Come here.

37:01.189 --> 37:02.657
Do you smell that?

37:02.691 --> 37:04.125
Yeah.

37:05.393 --> 37:07.928
Babe, she could burn down
the house.

37:12.234 --> 37:13.134
Alright, I'll go down.

37:13.168 --> 37:14.536
Oh.

37:16.271 --> 37:17.272
Babe.

37:18.406 --> 37:21.076
I'll deal with it,
I got it, I got it.

37:22.611 --> 37:23.978
Oh my God.

37:35.724 --> 37:40.095
Pretending not to see me
like that rude wife of yours?

37:40.128 --> 37:43.431
She fits in perfectly with
those fish-lipped trophy wives

37:43.465 --> 37:46.501
hooked on chardonnay
and antidepressants.

37:48.270 --> 37:50.438
Print keeps getting smaller.

37:50.472 --> 37:52.040
You like my remodel?

37:52.073 --> 37:54.442
Budget was a little tight.

37:54.476 --> 37:58.280
Yeah, well, it uh,
wasn't meant for that.

37:58.313 --> 38:01.216
You thought
you could bribe me to go?

38:01.249 --> 38:03.018
Check a fucking sales record.

38:03.051 --> 38:05.819
There's a reason why
beach houses stay in families

38:05.853 --> 38:06.920
for generations.

38:06.954 --> 38:10.791
Okay, look,
you can't smoke under the house.

38:10.824 --> 38:13.662
Your mother got me hooked
on Menthols.

38:13.695 --> 38:15.163
Nasty habit.

38:15.196 --> 38:18.700
But I never quit anything
once I start.

38:18.733 --> 38:22.037
Yeah, well,
my mother died smoking, so...

38:22.070 --> 38:23.471
Yeah.

38:23.505 --> 38:25.573
It really is dangerous.

38:27.008 --> 38:28.510
Tracey's right.

38:28.543 --> 38:31.680
I could burn the house down.

38:32.946 --> 38:35.483
But you're not really worried
about fire.

38:35.517 --> 38:37.786
You still haven't cleared
the brush.

38:53.068 --> 38:55.070
No people food, Gary.

38:59.907 --> 39:03.844
What were you doing down there,
asking her to prom?

39:03.877 --> 39:05.180
I was weeding.

39:05.213 --> 39:07.482
Oh yeah, night weeding.

39:07.515 --> 39:10.518
- Is that a thing?
- Yeah, it's a thing.

39:10.552 --> 39:13.021
Seriously, Knox,
she's not your friend.

39:13.054 --> 39:14.389
She's not your mother.

39:14.422 --> 39:16.257
I know that.

39:16.291 --> 39:17.858
But I think
I can make her go away.

39:17.891 --> 39:19.060
Well, good.

39:19.094 --> 39:21.296
'Cause if you can't get me
pregnant, the least you can do

39:21.329 --> 39:23.098
is get her the hell out of here!

39:23.131 --> 39:25.367
Well, maybe I'll just do both.

39:30.038 --> 39:31.473
God.

39:31.506 --> 39:34.908
Hmm, twice in a day,
that's my hunky monkey!

39:34.942 --> 39:36.378
That's right.

39:53.495 --> 39:54.796
Wait, wait, Knox!

39:54.829 --> 39:55.830
What?

39:58.066 --> 40:00.335
I think Bree's in here.

40:00.368 --> 40:02.437
What?

40:02.470 --> 40:04.072
I think she's in here.

40:07.575 --> 40:09.677
I'll go check.

40:11.513 --> 40:13.281
Just stay here.

40:38.373 --> 40:39.908
Door's locked.

40:52.420 --> 40:54.856
Are you sure?

40:54.889 --> 40:55.690
Am I sure?

40:55.723 --> 40:57.592
Yeah, hello, hormones.

40:57.625 --> 40:58.893
I'm not paranoid.

40:58.927 --> 41:01.663
There's a crazy lady
living underneath the house.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.368
Well...

41:07.402 --> 41:08.703
Well?

41:08.736 --> 41:11.072
There's a very handsome man
living in your house, so.

41:11.940 --> 41:12.973
Yeah, there is.

41:14.476 --> 41:16.344
Okay.

41:16.377 --> 41:17.812
Don't worry.

42:25.513 --> 42:26.848
Gary!

42:31.419 --> 42:32.620
Oh.

42:41.496 --> 42:43.932
I love you.

42:43.965 --> 42:45.099
I love you...

42:45.133 --> 42:46.267
oh, you were talking
to the dog,

42:46.301 --> 42:47.068
I thought you meant me.

42:53.908 --> 42:54.609
Honey?

42:54.642 --> 42:56.244
Hey, hey, it's okay.

42:57.946 --> 42:59.981
I'm sorry.

43:00.015 --> 43:03.818
I'm just so afraid of getting
my hopes up again.

43:03.851 --> 43:05.353
Come here, it's okay.

43:09.791 --> 43:10.892
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

43:10.925 --> 43:12.493
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
what are you doing?

43:12.527 --> 43:14.395
I just... I just put that up!

43:14.429 --> 43:15.964
You wanna tip off the city?

43:19.467 --> 43:20.802
Fine, fuck it.

43:22.637 --> 43:27.241
Listen, if you fence her out,
she'll just dig in even deeper.

43:27.275 --> 43:30.345
See there's crazy,
there's Malibu crazy,

43:30.378 --> 43:31.512
then there's Bree.

43:34.882 --> 43:37.885
You know,
Bree used to be even hotter.

43:37.919 --> 43:39.187
Yeah, back in the day,
I remember

43:39.220 --> 43:43.358
when we put in that deck,
she came to watch,

43:43.391 --> 43:45.793
Hiron almost cut his hand off.

43:45.827 --> 43:47.462
Wait a minute,

43:47.495 --> 43:49.098
you've worked
on this house before?

43:49.130 --> 43:51.899
I've worked on
every house before.

43:53.201 --> 43:57.106
Hey uh, you need a ride
to the bank?

43:57.138 --> 43:58.706
Uh yeah,
let me just grab my phone.

44:21.596 --> 44:22.263
Oh, cool.

44:22.296 --> 44:24.532
Ready.

44:27.568 --> 44:30.005
Aw, hello baby.

44:30.039 --> 44:31.172
Hi, cutie.

44:40.149 --> 44:42.283
I don't know if I could work
with my husband,

44:42.316 --> 44:44.786
but we do love watching
those home design shows.

44:44.819 --> 44:46.721
Seems like so much fun.

44:46.754 --> 44:49.757
Mhmm, it's mostly stress.

44:51.060 --> 44:53.594
Any way you can reduce
that stress?

44:53.628 --> 44:56.531
We're in the middle
of a renovation.

44:56.564 --> 44:57.832
Okay.

44:57.865 --> 44:59.867
Hey, getting pregnant
during a remodel is hard,

44:59.901 --> 45:02.171
but staying pregnant
is even harder.

45:02.203 --> 45:05.140
Here, scooch down a little bit.

45:07.542 --> 45:08.910
Oh my.

45:10.411 --> 45:12.280
What's going on here?

46:03.165 --> 46:04.766
Let's go.

46:13.708 --> 46:15.309
Pssh, wait.

46:31.893 --> 46:34.462
Hmm-hmm, you're home.

46:50.212 --> 46:52.747
Trace, oh.

46:52.780 --> 46:53.714
Guess again.

47:23.111 --> 47:26.248
You can't make this go away.

47:38.227 --> 47:40.962
Woah!
Stop right there!

47:40.995 --> 47:43.031
You're dripping
all over the floor.

47:46.201 --> 47:48.870
Still no sign
of social services.

47:48.903 --> 47:50.538
I called all of the shelters.

47:50.571 --> 47:54.042
The closest one is downtown L.A.

47:54.076 --> 47:55.943
So woohoo,
we're on a waiting list

47:55.977 --> 47:57.879
to get a fucking crazy lady out
from under a house

47:57.912 --> 48:00.381
we can't sell.

48:00.414 --> 48:02.450
Honey, I think the shots
are making you

48:02.483 --> 48:04.452
a little emotional.

48:04.485 --> 48:05.453
Fuck you, Knox.

48:05.486 --> 48:07.755
You didn't even ask
how the new doctor was.

48:07.788 --> 48:09.924
- Oh, that's right.
- Yeah.

48:09.957 --> 48:11.226
I for... I'm sorry, yeah.

48:11.260 --> 48:13.295
How did it uh... how did it go?

48:13.328 --> 48:15.496
I didn't make one single egg.

48:18.300 --> 48:20.401
I made 20.

48:20.434 --> 48:21.535
- What?
- Yeah.

48:21.569 --> 48:23.905
Turns out
I'm a pretty good egg farmer.

48:23.938 --> 48:24.939
Are you proud?

48:24.972 --> 48:27.242
Honey, yes, I am.

48:27.276 --> 48:28.542
I love it.

48:29.911 --> 48:31.812
So 20 eggs that means 20 babies,
huh?

48:31.846 --> 48:32.780
- Hmm.
- I like it.

48:32.813 --> 48:33.714
It's... it's a lot.

48:33.748 --> 48:35.083
Alright, I'm gonna get dressed.

48:38.153 --> 48:39.820
<i>Tragedy strikes in Malibu.</i>

48:39.854 --> 48:42.523
<i>Movie producer, Steven Lehvey
and his 9-year-old son</i>

48:42.556 --> 48:45.260
<i>were killed after their car
plunged 200 feet</i>

48:45.294 --> 48:47.029
<i>off Malibu Canyon Road.</i>

48:47.062 --> 48:48.596
<i>The boy is survived
by his mother,</i>

48:48.629 --> 48:50.965
<i>Lehvey's ex-wife, Bree.</i>

48:50.998 --> 48:53.734
Yeah, that's gotta be
why she snapped.

48:53.768 --> 48:56.004
It's horrible.

48:56.038 --> 48:59.507
But it doesn't change anything.

48:59.540 --> 49:02.476
We're not gonna just give her
her house back.

49:05.913 --> 49:08.449
Gary, dinner!

49:10.185 --> 49:12.287
He's probably stuck in a crate.

49:14.755 --> 49:16.358
Gary!

49:18.093 --> 49:20.228
Did you remember
to close the door?

49:22.663 --> 49:24.865
Hey, uh!

49:24.899 --> 49:26.834
Uh!

49:26.867 --> 49:28.502
Gary!

49:29.837 --> 49:31.440
Gary!

49:31.472 --> 49:33.375
Gary!

49:34.642 --> 49:36.577
Gary!

49:38.713 --> 49:39.780
Gary!

49:39.814 --> 49:41.549
Gary!

49:41.582 --> 49:43.018
Come here, boy!

49:43.051 --> 49:44.353
Gary!

49:50.725 --> 49:52.593
He didn't have dinner.

49:54.528 --> 49:57.531
Honey, we'll do a full sweep
in the morning.

49:57.565 --> 49:58.233
Okay?

49:58.266 --> 50:00.168
He's gonna show up, I promise.

51:26.188 --> 51:27.788
Knox!

51:27.822 --> 51:29.391
Honey, you forgot your phone.

51:33.428 --> 51:34.429
What?

51:36.764 --> 51:38.666
No.

51:38.699 --> 51:40.968
No.

51:41.001 --> 51:42.670
Dammit, Knox!

51:55.716 --> 51:57.618
Did you even look?

51:59.221 --> 52:01.056
Honey, I'm sorry.

52:01.089 --> 52:02.656
I'm so, so sorry.

52:07.262 --> 52:09.663
How can I trust you
with our child?

52:11.732 --> 52:15.203
I'm gonna be a bad father,
because I ran over a dog?

52:15.237 --> 52:17.439
He was my baby!

52:20.975 --> 52:24.179
What are you doing?

52:24.212 --> 52:25.646
Honey, we need to bury him.

52:25.679 --> 52:27.315
No!

52:27.349 --> 52:28.316
I want him with me.

52:28.350 --> 52:29.917
It's not our house.

52:29.950 --> 52:31.785
We have to cremate him.

52:31.819 --> 52:33.155
Honey, I loved Gary, too.

52:33.188 --> 52:35.956
But we can't spend 300 bucks
on a dog funeral.

52:48.103 --> 52:50.505
Yeah, let's see if the
economy by how well

52:50.539 --> 52:51.906
these people are doing.

52:56.677 --> 52:58.812
I can't believe
he threw this in the trash,

52:58.846 --> 52:59.713
lucky you were there.

52:59.747 --> 53:01.283
No problem.

53:08.889 --> 53:10.858
Man, I miss war.

53:10.891 --> 53:12.860
Yeah, me too.

53:12.893 --> 53:16.431
It's like what you ladies
must feel in childbirth.

53:16.464 --> 53:21.469
Having the power of life
and death.

53:21.503 --> 53:24.705
Yeah, that and wasting people.

53:25.973 --> 53:30.245
Well, what doesn't kill you
makes you dead inside.

53:30.278 --> 53:32.614
Yeah.

53:32.647 --> 53:35.283
Alright, that's it,
everybody out now!

53:35.317 --> 53:36.884
This is private property.

53:36.917 --> 53:39.454
Yeah, she's got rights.

53:39.487 --> 53:41.889
Hey, Mr. Five Dollar!

53:41.922 --> 53:43.757
Saw you at the hardware store.

53:43.791 --> 53:45.160
You see me?

53:45.193 --> 53:48.430
Everyone deserves to be seen.

53:48.463 --> 53:50.565
You want us to go home, buddy?

53:50.599 --> 53:52.733
Yeah, I do, get outta here.

53:55.270 --> 53:58.039
We ain't got no home, buddy.

53:58.073 --> 54:01.109
And we were just having fun.

54:01.142 --> 54:03.777
I could do this all night.

54:03.811 --> 54:06.747
No, I don't know.

54:06.780 --> 54:09.384
You about ready to leave,
Rodney?

54:09.417 --> 54:12.487
I'd rather be water-boarded.

54:12.520 --> 54:15.657
Okay, easy, my brother.

54:15.690 --> 54:16.790
There you go.

54:16.824 --> 54:17.825
Family.

54:20.095 --> 54:21.829
Comprende, amigo?

54:21.862 --> 54:23.231
Family.

54:23.265 --> 54:25.833
Alright, let's pack it up, boys.

54:25.866 --> 54:27.235
Vamonos.

54:27.269 --> 54:29.437
Anything for our queen.

54:29.471 --> 54:32.007
And free steak.

54:32.040 --> 54:34.175
Thank you.

54:34.209 --> 54:36.444
Bye, lover boy.

54:36.478 --> 54:38.580
Don't be rude to the guests,
Papa Pigeon.

54:38.613 --> 54:40.115
They're not my guests.

54:40.148 --> 54:42.183
These boys are true friends.

54:42.217 --> 54:44.519
You can't count on anyone
in this town.

54:44.552 --> 54:46.221
They're all crazy.

54:46.254 --> 54:49.291
Fucking Malibu crazy.

54:49.324 --> 54:50.824
Like that lying whore, Joan.

54:50.858 --> 54:52.360
Some friend
she turned out to be,

54:52.394 --> 54:54.629
stealing my husband.

54:54.663 --> 54:56.197
Why are you still here?

54:56.231 --> 54:57.365
Hmm?

54:58.866 --> 55:00.801
Because I belong here.

55:00.834 --> 55:02.137
You never will.

55:02.170 --> 55:03.705
Tell me something, Bree.

55:05.774 --> 55:09.010
What's the wife of
a big Hollywood producer doing

55:09.044 --> 55:10.545
living under a house?

55:10.578 --> 55:11.912
Hmm?

55:11.945 --> 55:14.649
For what, ghosts?

55:14.683 --> 55:16.584
Your son and husband are dead.

55:18.852 --> 55:23.058
Face it, Bree,
you're all alone here.

55:28.363 --> 55:30.665
And I thought
you cared about me, Knox.

55:32.600 --> 55:35.002
Maybe you only like me
in the shower?

55:47.215 --> 55:48.149
Oh, hey man, what's up?

55:48.183 --> 55:49.617
I was just about to head
to the bank.

55:50.884 --> 55:53.221
Uh, wrong direction.

55:53.254 --> 55:56.524
Hey, I need the last quarter,
up front.

55:56.558 --> 55:59.394
Yeah, well, I thought
we'd be further along.

55:59.427 --> 56:02.097
Well, there is
the squatter factor.

56:03.931 --> 56:06.134
I can pay you,
but you gotta help me out, man.

56:06.167 --> 56:07.402
Come on.

56:10.772 --> 56:14.942
I can't have you hijacking
my construction.

56:14.975 --> 56:16.277
Now you fuck with me

56:16.311 --> 56:18.246
and I fuck with you,
Mrs. Lehvey.

56:18.279 --> 56:19.381
Are we clear?

56:21.216 --> 56:23.951
Are you high?

56:23.984 --> 56:25.720
My client is not happy.

56:27.689 --> 56:30.191
Well, I wasn't happy
with you either, Griff.

56:30.225 --> 56:30.891
What are you gonna do?

56:30.924 --> 56:31.992
Call the city on me?

56:32.026 --> 56:34.429
They'll send out an inspector
out here tout suite!

56:34.462 --> 56:36.398
By the way, that's French for,
"you're fucked".

56:38.932 --> 56:40.602
Fuck!

56:53.548 --> 56:55.116
15 grand.

56:55.150 --> 56:58.086
We need Cararra
countertops, it's Malibu.

57:04.359 --> 57:05.926
We just shelled out 6 grand

57:05.959 --> 57:07.629
for your fancy
new picture window.

57:07.662 --> 57:09.664
And we have other expenses,
babe.

57:09.697 --> 57:12.966
Like my massive medical bills?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.670
Sorry, I'm such a failure
and destined to be a drunk

57:15.703 --> 57:17.105
like both my parents.

57:17.138 --> 57:18.606
You're not a failure.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.275
Oh, just a drunk?

57:20.308 --> 57:21.676
Thanks.

57:22.710 --> 57:24.913
Look, we either pay
for fertility

57:24.945 --> 57:26.947
or finish the construction,
what do you wanna do?

57:29.384 --> 57:30.785
Who cares?

57:30.819 --> 57:33.655
We both know it's never
gonna happen anyway.

57:33.688 --> 57:36.257
We just can't afford to have
anything else go wrong.

57:39.993 --> 57:43.331
Motion lights.

57:43.364 --> 57:44.766
No.

57:44.799 --> 57:45.700
Fucking.

57:45.733 --> 57:46.835
Way!

58:02.750 --> 58:04.719
He shouldn't have been there,
the tide was pushing in.

58:04.752 --> 58:07.622
Yeah, is that what
we're calling her now?

58:07.655 --> 58:09.290
We just need to finish
this thing

58:09.324 --> 58:10.391
and get the hell out.

58:10.425 --> 58:12.393
Really, Knox?

58:12.427 --> 58:14.362
You think she'll just
let us finish?

58:14.395 --> 58:16.030
Your mom couldn't get rid
of Bree.

58:16.064 --> 58:17.165
You think you can?

58:17.198 --> 58:20.000
What will it take for you
to get half as pissed as me?

58:20.034 --> 58:21.069
Don't say estrogen!

58:21.102 --> 58:23.104
'Cause crazy can't win!

58:30.545 --> 58:31.913
Yeah, hi mom.

58:31.946 --> 58:34.382
I'm so excited,
I'll call you from inside,

58:34.415 --> 58:35.650
so you can hear the heartbeat.

58:35.683 --> 58:37.552
I know!
Crazy fast, right?

58:37.585 --> 58:38.753
Happened first try.

58:38.786 --> 58:41.055
And I thought
we'd be out all this money.

58:41.089 --> 58:43.491
I'm gonna be a mommy.

58:43.525 --> 58:45.059
Mrs. Bannett.

58:53.968 --> 58:58.039
Okay, so I wanna lower
the dosage next round.

58:58.072 --> 58:58.907
- Okay.
- Okay?

58:58.940 --> 59:02.577
The hormones triggered
early ovulation.

59:02.610 --> 59:04.879
Um, what does that mean?

59:04.913 --> 59:06.548
I'm afraid we can't do in vitro.

59:06.581 --> 59:09.551
The cycle.

59:11.020 --> 59:15.690
Well, we... we can't afford
to lose another month.

59:15.723 --> 59:17.759
Is there something that
we can do?

59:21.796 --> 59:25.567
Doctor said only chance is
doing it the old-fashioned way.

59:25.600 --> 59:26.434
What?

59:26.467 --> 59:27.902
Babe, the workers are here.

59:27.936 --> 59:28.903
I'm in this with you now,

59:28.937 --> 59:30.271
so you better give me a baby.

59:30.305 --> 59:31.139
Let's go.

59:31.172 --> 59:32.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:34.509 --> 59:36.544
Sorry, it's your
baby-making shirt.

59:36.578 --> 59:38.112
I need a jumpstart.

59:43.284 --> 59:44.619
Careful, this... you got this?

59:44.652 --> 59:45.687
Lo tengo, lo tengo.

59:45.720 --> 59:47.155
- Despacio!
- Okay.

1:00:03.838 --> 1:00:05.673
Knox?

1:00:05.707 --> 1:00:06.808
Where are you?

1:00:07.609 --> 1:00:09.044
I'm here.

1:00:09.078 --> 1:00:12.614
No, you're not.

1:00:13.715 --> 1:00:14.682
No, I'm right here.

1:00:14.716 --> 1:00:15.617
I'm right here.

1:00:31.432 --> 1:00:32.367
Ow!

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:33.868
Oh my God!

1:00:33.901 --> 1:00:34.736
Ah.

1:00:36.671 --> 1:00:39.907
Wha...
Hey.

1:00:39.941 --> 1:00:42.443
There's nothing sadder
than a woman who can't fulfill

1:00:42.477 --> 1:00:44.178
her basic biological function.

1:00:44.212 --> 1:00:46.881
Oh no, trust me,
I know the whole science route,

1:00:46.914 --> 1:00:49.217
the pee sticks, the blood work.

1:00:49.250 --> 1:00:52.654
Then you stop having sex
and that doesn't help.

1:00:52.687 --> 1:00:54.722
Makes even a good man stray.

1:00:54.756 --> 1:00:56.658
Oh, have you tried the tea?

1:00:56.691 --> 1:00:58.660
It works.
It's how I got my Roman.

1:00:59.861 --> 1:01:01.063
Mm, never mind.

1:01:01.096 --> 1:01:03.431
Even a baby can't save
your marriage at this point.

1:01:03.464 --> 1:01:06.000
Fuck you, Bree.

1:01:06.035 --> 1:01:07.069
What?

1:01:07.102 --> 1:01:08.070
Knox is right.

1:01:08.103 --> 1:01:10.805
The drugs are making you
emotional, Tracey.

1:01:10.838 --> 1:01:13.008
Stay the hell away from us!

1:01:14.642 --> 1:01:18.013
Happy Valentine's Day!

1:01:33.494 --> 1:01:35.396
Mmm.

1:01:35.430 --> 1:01:36.698
I'm so glad I made this for you.

1:01:42.704 --> 1:01:45.840
Did you write the check
to Dr. Baum?

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:47.375
What do you think?

1:01:47.408 --> 1:01:48.910
Honey, please.

1:01:48.943 --> 1:01:50.278
Don't tease me.

1:01:50.311 --> 1:01:52.413
You know, I'm super sensitive
right now.

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:53.614
Of course, I did.

1:01:53.648 --> 1:01:55.184
Come on.

1:01:57.019 --> 1:02:00.755
That's the point of
this whole thing, it's for us.

1:02:00.788 --> 1:02:02.590
Are we okay?

1:02:06.227 --> 1:02:13.234
You know, I've been moving
around my whole life.

1:02:13.267 --> 1:02:17.238
In between evictions
and mom getting help.

1:02:19.874 --> 1:02:21.843
And not getting help.

1:02:25.147 --> 1:02:30.852
All that noise and the moving,
the chaos...

1:02:33.788 --> 1:02:36.091
...it was like living
under construction.

1:02:38.292 --> 1:02:40.129
I didn't even know
it wasn't normal.

1:02:41.896 --> 1:02:43.798
But now I see it.

1:02:47.136 --> 1:02:48.302
The quiet.

1:02:50.872 --> 1:02:54.809
Because no matter
how loud it gets

1:02:54.842 --> 1:03:00.015
or where we're living,
I know where my home is.

1:03:02.984 --> 1:03:04.819
It's with you.

1:03:10.025 --> 1:03:12.727
Get the fork out of here.

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:15.696
I mean it, Tracey.

1:03:15.730 --> 1:03:17.365
I'm lucky to have you.

1:03:21.302 --> 1:03:23.238
And so was Gary.

1:03:23.272 --> 1:03:24.872
Mmm.

1:03:30.945 --> 1:03:34.216
He taught us how to be parents.

1:03:34.249 --> 1:03:35.483
Yeah, he did.

1:03:39.587 --> 1:03:44.159
And now we're ready to mess up
our very own human baby.

1:03:51.933 --> 1:03:57.939
I've been up and down
and pushing you away.

1:04:00.541 --> 1:04:06.014
You've been so patient with me
and hung in there.

1:04:11.053 --> 1:04:14.822
And you were right,
what you said before,

1:04:14.856 --> 1:04:16.457
it is the hormones.

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:21.462
And I am so sorry.

1:04:40.715 --> 1:04:42.683
Hey, have I told you
my construction joke?

1:04:42.717 --> 1:04:43.517
No.

1:04:43.551 --> 1:04:44.819
Hold on, it's not done yet.

1:04:46.088 --> 1:04:49.390
That's a good one.

1:04:49.423 --> 1:04:50.825
I can't wait to see
our new window.

1:04:50.858 --> 1:04:52.593
I know, me too.

1:04:55.297 --> 1:04:57.366
Hey, let's see it
from the beach.

1:04:57.398 --> 1:04:58.367
Yeah.

1:05:11.313 --> 1:05:13.981
Alright, let's see this thing.

1:05:16.417 --> 1:05:19.487
- Wow.
- Mhmm.

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:21.223
And you doubted me.

1:05:21.256 --> 1:05:22.090
I know.

1:05:22.124 --> 1:05:23.325
What was I thinking?

1:05:23.358 --> 1:05:23.991
I don't know.

1:05:25.027 --> 1:05:26.928
Why you doubted me.

1:05:42.910 --> 1:05:44.545
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:05:57.858 --> 1:05:58.826
- You okay?
- Oh my God

1:05:58.859 --> 1:06:00.028
Yeah.

1:06:00.062 --> 1:06:02.997
Yeah, see she's right there.

1:06:03.031 --> 1:06:05.133
Alright, get out.

1:06:05.167 --> 1:06:07.135
- Did you enjoy the breeze?
- That's it.

1:06:07.169 --> 1:06:08.869
Get... get her the hell
outta here!

1:06:08.903 --> 1:06:11.906
Step back, please.

1:06:11.939 --> 1:06:14.976
Mrs. Lehvey,
whenever you're ready.

1:06:24.386 --> 1:06:27.022
Accidents happen
in construction.

1:06:29.458 --> 1:06:32.760
We're not playing
in a wheat field in Tulsa.

1:06:32.793 --> 1:06:34.762
The danger is real!

1:06:34.795 --> 1:06:37.065
What?

1:06:37.099 --> 1:06:38.766
You think you're gonna be young,
and beautiful,

1:06:38.799 --> 1:06:40.268
and just live forever?

1:06:43.537 --> 1:06:45.240
Hey!

1:06:48.843 --> 1:06:50.312
Where's my phone call!

1:06:51.912 --> 1:06:53.248
What if she gets out?

1:06:53.281 --> 1:06:55.549
No, the sheriff said
she wouldn't see a judge

1:06:55.583 --> 1:06:57.352
for 72 hours.

1:06:57.386 --> 1:06:58.986
God, she's like a boomerang.

1:06:59.021 --> 1:07:01.356
You throw her out,
she comes right back.

1:07:03.591 --> 1:07:06.395
Nice security system.

1:07:07.595 --> 1:07:11.299
Honey, I promise, I won't let
anything happen to you.

1:07:18.939 --> 1:07:20.375
Thank you, babe.

1:07:22.077 --> 1:07:23.311
Don't worry.

1:07:23.345 --> 1:07:24.545
Okay.

1:07:31.752 --> 1:07:33.721
Alright, Bree, let's go.

1:07:33.754 --> 1:07:35.223
You made bail.

1:07:44.665 --> 1:07:46.134
Come on, let's move.

1:07:59.947 --> 1:08:00.915
Come on.

1:08:00.948 --> 1:08:02.817
Coming!

1:08:02.850 --> 1:08:04.086
Ugh!

1:08:10.392 --> 1:08:12.793
Thank you for coming.

1:08:12.827 --> 1:08:15.564
Yeah, do you wanna show
me where she's been living?

1:08:15.596 --> 1:08:18.599
Well, right down here.

1:08:18.632 --> 1:08:20.535
Sorry for the delay.

1:08:20.569 --> 1:08:24.372
There's only 58,000
homeless people in L.A. County.

1:08:24.406 --> 1:08:26.041
Hmm, that's more people
than my hometown.

1:08:26.074 --> 1:08:27.641
Mhmm.

1:08:56.271 --> 1:08:57.272
Well, you are right.

1:08:57.305 --> 1:09:00.008
These are not
safe living conditions.

1:09:00.041 --> 1:09:02.010
I hope you can relocate her.

1:09:02.043 --> 1:09:04.546
Yeah, I'm not animal control.

1:09:04.579 --> 1:09:07.349
She's not a raccoon,
she's a person.

1:09:09.217 --> 1:09:11.986
But I was able to pull
a few strings

1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:15.157
and get her a bed downtown.

1:09:15.190 --> 1:09:16.757
That's amazing.

1:09:46.321 --> 1:09:48.056
You know what,
I can just take her right now.

1:09:48.089 --> 1:09:49.524
Now?

1:09:50.392 --> 1:09:51.992
Yeah, you said
it was an emergency.

1:09:52.027 --> 1:09:54.129
Where is she?

1:09:54.162 --> 1:09:57.831
Um, she's... she's in jail.

1:09:59.767 --> 1:10:01.303
So what you're saying is

1:10:01.336 --> 1:10:04.206
I can't take her because
she's not here?

1:10:04.239 --> 1:10:07.342
And I drove an hour and a half
on PCH.

1:10:09.110 --> 1:10:10.711
Peace out.

1:11:43.238 --> 1:11:44.239
Hold up, Knox.

1:11:44.272 --> 1:11:45.806
Griff, can we do this later?

1:11:45.839 --> 1:11:47.409
No, no, no,
we ain't doin' this later.

1:11:47.442 --> 1:11:49.344
I need my 10K today.

1:11:49.377 --> 1:11:52.647
Come on, man,
get off my back, will ya?

1:11:55.684 --> 1:11:56.751
See.

1:11:56.785 --> 1:11:58.787
See, this is why
I don't do un-permitted work.

1:11:58.819 --> 1:12:00.722
'Cause see people like you
try and take advantage of me,

1:12:00.755 --> 1:12:01.523
right?

1:12:03.291 --> 1:12:05.160
Listen dickhead,

1:12:05.193 --> 1:12:07.529
I put my ass on the line
for you.

1:12:07.562 --> 1:12:09.597
I got my best worker out,

1:12:09.631 --> 1:12:14.102
I got A-listers who pay
waitin' on me.

1:12:14.135 --> 1:12:15.036
Now if...

1:12:19.174 --> 1:12:22.377
If you ain't square with me
by the end of the day,

1:12:22.410 --> 1:12:23.712
then we're moving on.

1:12:23.745 --> 1:12:26.014
And ain't nobody around here
gonna touch you

1:12:26.047 --> 1:12:28.882
or your goddamn shit shack!

1:12:28.916 --> 1:12:30.618
8, 9, 10 to make 10,000.

1:12:30.652 --> 1:12:33.421
Great.
Thank you.

1:12:33.455 --> 1:12:34.789
Um, do you have an envelope?

1:12:35.824 --> 1:12:39.094
Uh, will you be making
a deposit today?

1:12:39.127 --> 1:12:40.928
Uh, no.

1:12:40.961 --> 1:12:43.031
Can I check my balance though?

1:12:43.064 --> 1:12:43.931
Of course.

1:12:54.843 --> 1:12:57.278
Sorry, thank you.

1:12:57.312 --> 1:12:58.847
Thank you, I'm sorry.

1:13:00.615 --> 1:13:02.384
Next.

1:14:11.719 --> 1:14:14.355
Social services finally came.

1:14:14.389 --> 1:14:15.924
Perfect timing.

1:14:18.660 --> 1:14:21.029
And that wasn't the worst part
of my day.

1:14:24.098 --> 1:14:27.168
Honey, come on, you can't trust
a cheap box test.

1:14:27.202 --> 1:14:29.037
They're 99% accurate.

1:14:29.070 --> 1:14:30.572
Well, the doctor is just trying
to drag this out,

1:14:30.605 --> 1:14:33.174
so he can make more money.

1:14:33.208 --> 1:14:36.277
It's not her fault I'm barren.

1:14:36.311 --> 1:14:40.682
Okay, this is the part
where you tell me that I'm not.

1:14:40.715 --> 1:14:43.418
Knox, are you even listening
to me?

1:14:43.451 --> 1:14:44.919
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:14:44.953 --> 1:14:46.454
It was just here.

1:14:46.488 --> 1:14:47.522
What are you looking for?

1:14:47.555 --> 1:14:49.557
An envelope from the bank.

1:14:57.565 --> 1:14:59.434
Yummy fertility tea.

1:14:59.467 --> 1:15:01.169
You want some?

1:15:01.202 --> 1:15:02.537
Me neither.

1:15:04.939 --> 1:15:06.574
He's got his crew
running around here,

1:15:06.608 --> 1:15:08.243
unsupervised.

1:15:37.672 --> 1:15:39.707
Did you check the bedroom?

1:16:18.513 --> 1:16:20.114
Why do you have this?

1:16:27.422 --> 1:16:28.856
What's that smell?

1:16:33.995 --> 1:16:35.030
Oh my God.

1:16:35.064 --> 1:16:36.031
Call 911!

1:16:36.065 --> 1:16:37.765
Shit!

1:16:37.799 --> 1:16:39.667
Where's my phone?

1:16:39.701 --> 1:16:41.869
Hey, hey!

1:16:41.903 --> 1:16:43.638
You can't be burning things
out here.

1:16:43.671 --> 1:16:45.773
What are you...

1:16:45.807 --> 1:16:49.110
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no!

1:16:49.143 --> 1:16:50.511
Ow!

1:16:54.248 --> 1:16:56.851
Oh no, no, no, no.

1:16:56.884 --> 1:16:58.987
Enjoy the barbecue.

1:17:08.596 --> 1:17:09.497
Where's the money, man?

1:17:09.530 --> 1:17:11.733
It's gone.

1:17:11.766 --> 1:17:13.468
- She burned it, man.
- Oh, come on.

1:17:13.501 --> 1:17:15.136
Come on!

1:17:22.477 --> 1:17:23.678
What is this?

1:17:23.711 --> 1:17:25.047
Griff's final payment.

1:17:28.616 --> 1:17:30.351
What are you saying?

1:17:30.385 --> 1:17:33.721
I'm saying she's down there,
burning our money.

1:17:33.755 --> 1:17:35.057
Well, how'd she get out?

1:17:35.090 --> 1:17:35.890
I don't know!

1:17:35.923 --> 1:17:38.693
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:17:44.999 --> 1:17:47.069
Mom, it's the flippers.

1:18:23.371 --> 1:18:25.840
You can't grill on the beach,
it's illegal.

1:18:25.873 --> 1:18:28.209
Good evening, Mrs. Mahoaney.

1:18:28.242 --> 1:18:30.645
Sheriff Garcia.

1:18:30.678 --> 1:18:32.280
Sorry to bother you.

1:18:32.313 --> 1:18:36.317
Have you seen your old
neighbour, Bree Lehvey?

1:18:46.494 --> 1:18:48.863
That was my money you torched.

1:18:48.896 --> 1:18:51.933
I can't get blood
from a fucking stone.

1:18:56.337 --> 1:18:58.506
You think I won't tell the cops
that you put Paco

1:18:58.539 --> 1:19:01.709
in a fucking coma?

1:19:09.051 --> 1:19:11.986
I should kill your fucking ass.

1:19:15.656 --> 1:19:19.293
Well, just be aware that uh,
she could be dangerous.

1:19:19.327 --> 1:19:20.495
Could be?

1:19:20.528 --> 1:19:22.463
She broke into our house,
almost burned it down,

1:19:22.497 --> 1:19:24.766
and stole all of our money!

1:19:24.799 --> 1:19:27.835
Can't you people leave
that woman alone?

1:19:27.869 --> 1:19:29.637
And don't make us bail her
out again.

1:19:29.670 --> 1:19:31.672
The parking
in the valley is terrible.

1:19:31.706 --> 1:19:33.307
Come on, sweetie.

1:19:36.811 --> 1:19:37.612
Oh my.

1:19:37.645 --> 1:19:38.646
Hmm.

1:19:38.679 --> 1:19:39.680
I can't...

1:19:39.714 --> 1:19:41.415
This is unbelievable.

1:19:41.449 --> 1:19:42.784
That went well.

1:19:57.965 --> 1:19:59.300
But you're Bree.

1:20:09.610 --> 1:20:11.146
Ah!

1:20:18.953 --> 1:20:20.822
Let me get this straight,

1:20:20.855 --> 1:20:23.357
you accused her
of shattering a window.

1:20:23.391 --> 1:20:25.760
Now you claim
she stole from you.

1:20:25.793 --> 1:20:28.830
There's no proof of any of this.

1:20:28.863 --> 1:20:32.167
I realize Mrs. Lehvey
is an inconvenience,

1:20:32.201 --> 1:20:33.968
but she is still a citizen

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:36.671
who will be here
long after you two leave.

1:20:36.704 --> 1:20:40.708
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have real bad guys to catch.

1:20:40.741 --> 1:20:42.110
Yeah.

1:21:14.042 --> 1:21:15.910
Where's Griff?

1:21:18.313 --> 1:21:19.413
Hiron, what?

1:21:19.447 --> 1:21:20.414
What is it?

1:21:21.649 --> 1:21:23.285
It's Friday.

1:21:23.318 --> 1:21:24.452
Pay day.

1:21:29.423 --> 1:21:30.992
Okay, excuse me.

1:21:48.377 --> 1:21:51.412
Nice, one step closer
to getting out of here.

1:21:54.582 --> 1:21:56.218
Alright, Griff.

1:21:58.486 --> 1:21:59.854
Afternoon.

1:21:59.887 --> 1:22:01.356
Excuse me, coming through.

1:22:01.390 --> 1:22:02.391
Oh.

1:22:02.423 --> 1:22:04.725
Received a call
from one of your neighbours.

1:22:04.759 --> 1:22:06.395
The Mahoaneys?

1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:07.461
Bree Lehvey.

1:22:07.495 --> 1:22:08.696
Shall we?

1:22:08.729 --> 1:22:10.065
Wha...

1:22:12.833 --> 1:22:15.203
- Lot of nice work here.
- Thanks.

1:22:15.237 --> 1:22:17.638
Yeah, just uh,
you know simple stuff.

1:22:17.672 --> 1:22:18.472
Found it!

1:22:19.341 --> 1:22:22.110
Really?

1:22:22.144 --> 1:22:25.579
Guys, that second bedroom
was here when we got the house.

1:22:25.613 --> 1:22:26.415
- Yeah?
- Come on.

1:22:26.447 --> 1:22:27.648
I uh...

1:22:27.682 --> 1:22:30.052
I'm sure the city has
bigger fish to fry.

1:22:34.522 --> 1:22:36.191
Alright, look, Inspector,
just tell me.

1:22:36.224 --> 1:22:38.060
How much is it gonna take
for you guys

1:22:38.093 --> 1:22:39.161
to forget about this?

1:22:39.194 --> 1:22:42.431
Um, do I like my career, Bill?

1:22:42.463 --> 1:22:43.864
No.

1:22:43.898 --> 1:22:46.268
You love your career.

1:22:46.301 --> 1:22:48.070
I didn't graduate
the best online

1:22:48.103 --> 1:22:51.739
community college in Bakersfield
for nothing.

1:22:51.772 --> 1:22:53.674
Where's your contractor?

1:22:53.708 --> 1:22:54.875
He walked off the job.

1:22:56.178 --> 1:22:58.980
Yeah, well, Griff finishes,
if he gets paid.

1:22:59.014 --> 1:23:00.915
Guys, come on,
we're gonna be outta here

1:23:00.948 --> 1:23:01.816
in two weeks.

1:23:01.849 --> 1:23:02.883
Perfect.

1:23:02.917 --> 1:23:04.952
You got two weeks to tear
all this out,

1:23:04.986 --> 1:23:06.754
put in a proper
one bedroom/one bath.

1:23:06.787 --> 1:23:08.357
Mhmm.

1:23:08.390 --> 1:23:09.991
Let's go.

1:23:10.025 --> 1:23:11.826
You put this doorknob here,
that's on rust.

1:23:11.859 --> 1:23:12.693
Thanks.

1:23:12.727 --> 1:23:14.029
Hmm.

1:23:17.399 --> 1:23:19.000
Oh my... oh.

1:23:19.034 --> 1:23:21.502
Oh my God, Knox.

1:23:21.535 --> 1:23:22.170
Oh my God.

1:23:22.204 --> 1:23:22.737
Tracey!

1:23:24.805 --> 1:23:25.706
Oh my God.

1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:26.741
Honey, are you okay?

1:23:26.774 --> 1:23:27.708
Okay, okay, okay.

1:23:27.742 --> 1:23:29.044
I got you, I got you.

1:23:35.883 --> 1:23:38.453
Honey, we're gonna
get through this.

1:23:42.556 --> 1:23:45.394
You're lucky
you came in right away.

1:23:45.427 --> 1:23:47.695
I'm so sorry about the baby.

1:23:50.365 --> 1:23:51.732
Baby?

1:23:51.766 --> 1:23:52.600
What?

1:23:52.633 --> 1:23:53.601
No.

1:23:54.702 --> 1:23:55.870
No.

1:23:55.903 --> 1:23:58.606
I assumed
you'd taken a home test.

1:23:58.639 --> 1:23:59.807
I did.

1:24:02.477 --> 1:24:04.479
You were only
a few weeks along.

1:24:04.513 --> 1:24:07.082
What?

1:24:07.115 --> 1:24:09.650
I am so sorry.

1:24:11.053 --> 1:24:12.620
I should leave you two alone.

1:24:16.724 --> 1:24:17.792
God.

1:24:19.161 --> 1:24:21.796
Okay, okay.

1:24:21.829 --> 1:24:23.532
It's okay.

1:24:23.564 --> 1:24:25.333
Honey, it's okay.

1:24:25.367 --> 1:24:28.403
Do you know what this means?

1:24:28.437 --> 1:24:30.138
We have to start all over again.

1:24:30.172 --> 1:24:31.939
No, no.

1:24:33.475 --> 1:24:35.310
It means you can get pregnant.

1:24:35.343 --> 1:24:37.012
How?

1:24:37.045 --> 1:24:39.481
God, in a...
in a construction zone

1:24:39.514 --> 1:24:42.084
with a crazy lady and no money
to do IVF,

1:24:42.117 --> 1:24:45.719
because you gambled our future
away on a stolen beach house?

1:24:47.355 --> 1:24:50.025
That's a recipe
for quality embryos.

1:24:53.894 --> 1:24:55.996
I am sorry.

1:25:03.003 --> 1:25:04.638
It's okay.

1:25:06.974 --> 1:25:08.776
Maybe we dodged a bullet.

1:25:08.809 --> 1:25:10.711
With your family history.

1:25:12.780 --> 1:25:14.748
Wow.

1:25:14.782 --> 1:25:17.319
You can go now, I'm tired.

1:25:36.438 --> 1:25:38.073
<i>Hello, Papa Pigeon.</i>

1:25:38.106 --> 1:25:39.574
<i>I know Tracey is sad,</i>

1:25:39.608 --> 1:25:41.842
<i>because she didn't see
two lines on a stick.</i>

1:25:41.876 --> 1:25:44.446
<i>But having a child
is a huge responsibility.</i>

1:25:44.479 --> 1:25:46.248
<i>Like owning a beach house.</i>

1:25:46.281 --> 1:25:47.882
<i>You don't deserve either.</i>

1:25:47.915 --> 1:25:49.417
<i>You think you're special?</i>

1:25:49.451 --> 1:25:51.219
<i>A miscarriage is nothing
compared to the pain</i>

1:25:51.253 --> 1:25:53.288
<i>of losing a real child.</i>

1:25:53.321 --> 1:25:55.123
<i>You should thank me
for what I did.</i>

1:25:56.057 --> 1:25:58.026
<i>You messed up.</i>

1:25:58.059 --> 1:26:01.129
<i>You put a house before family.</i>

1:26:01.163 --> 1:26:03.231
<i>Now it's your turn
in the barrel.</i>

1:26:17.345 --> 1:26:19.481
Feeling lonely, hunky monkey?

1:27:33.622 --> 1:27:34.922
Hello!

1:27:34.955 --> 1:27:37.259
<i>Hey, it's me,
the doctor let me go,</i>

1:27:37.292 --> 1:27:39.294
<i>I'm waiting in the lobby.</i>

1:27:39.327 --> 1:27:40.395
Okay, honey.

1:27:40.428 --> 1:27:41.929
Honey, don't worry,
I'll be right there.

1:27:59.314 --> 1:28:00.948
Fuck!

1:28:26.675 --> 1:28:29.810
Well, you're up
past your bedtime.

1:28:31.279 --> 1:28:33.081
Was I uh... was I speeding,
Sheriff Garcia?

1:28:33.114 --> 1:28:34.349
No, no, no.

1:28:34.382 --> 1:28:35.784
Your bungee snapped.

1:28:35.816 --> 1:28:38.486
You're about to lose
whatever's under that tarp.

1:28:40.655 --> 1:28:42.956
Oh, it's uh... yeah, it's...
it's just some tools.

1:28:42.990 --> 1:28:44.825
Well, can't have anything
just flying out

1:28:44.858 --> 1:28:46.094
- onto the road.
- I understand.

1:28:46.127 --> 1:28:47.095
Cars running over it.

1:28:47.128 --> 1:28:48.496
Yep, you know what,
I'll... I'll go fix it.

1:28:48.530 --> 1:28:49.997
No, no, sit tight.

1:28:50.031 --> 1:28:51.433
I'll take care of it.

1:29:10.585 --> 1:29:12.287
Step out of the car.

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:14.089
We've got a problem.

1:29:31.972 --> 1:29:34.409
You lost your tools.

1:29:34.442 --> 1:29:37.178
You should circle back,
see if you can find them.

1:29:37.212 --> 1:29:39.581
I'll be on the look-out.

1:29:39.614 --> 1:29:42.150
Oh, and one other thing,

1:29:42.183 --> 1:29:48.757
we uh, found your contractor
floating outside your house.

1:29:48.790 --> 1:29:51.326
What?

1:29:51.359 --> 1:29:52.761
Griff?

1:29:52.794 --> 1:29:56.297
Had a dent in the back
of his head

1:29:56.331 --> 1:29:58.433
that matched this.

1:30:02.303 --> 1:30:03.304
Oh my God.

1:30:03.338 --> 1:30:04.506
What?

1:30:04.539 --> 1:30:08.209
How... what... I mean...

1:30:08.243 --> 1:30:10.478
How... how long has he been dead?

1:30:10.512 --> 1:30:13.047
I'd say about a day.

1:30:13.081 --> 1:30:15.717
Wanna tell me what you were
doing yesterday?

1:30:18.286 --> 1:30:21.189
I um... I was working.

1:30:21.222 --> 1:30:21.922
Working?

1:30:21.955 --> 1:30:23.425
Yeah.

1:30:23.458 --> 1:30:25.527
With a hammer?

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:26.361
Yeah, where... where's...

1:30:26.394 --> 1:30:27.529
Where's Bree?

1:30:27.562 --> 1:30:29.330
Why... why aren't you talking
to her?

1:30:29.364 --> 1:30:31.399
No one's seen her.

1:30:31.433 --> 1:30:35.470
And nothing in her history says
she's ever going anywhere.

1:30:35.503 --> 1:30:37.405
Now this is what I think.

1:30:37.439 --> 1:30:41.209
Griff asked you for his money,
you got into a fight with him.

1:30:41.242 --> 1:30:42.177
No.

1:30:42.210 --> 1:30:43.445
- No?
- No.

1:30:43.478 --> 1:30:46.980
Or you did something to Bree.

1:30:47.015 --> 1:30:50.185
Griff found out.

1:30:50.218 --> 1:30:52.187
And you did something to Griff.

1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:53.388
- No.
- That's it, isn't it?

1:30:53.421 --> 1:30:54.522
- No, that's not...
- That is it.

1:30:54.556 --> 1:30:55.890
- No.
- Come on, let's go.

1:30:55.924 --> 1:30:57.425
No, no, no,
I need to get my wife.

1:30:57.459 --> 1:30:59.060
No, you need to get your lawyer!

1:30:59.093 --> 1:31:00.662
Alright, alright, alright!

1:31:05.533 --> 1:31:08.069
The workers
said Griff walked off the job.

1:31:09.471 --> 1:31:12.006
Did that piss you off?

1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:15.643
Look, I lost my temper,
but I didn't do this.

1:31:15.677 --> 1:31:17.445
You're telling
me a 50-year-old woman

1:31:17.479 --> 1:31:19.647
killed a 200-pound contractor?

1:31:22.417 --> 1:31:24.118
I never touched him.

1:31:24.152 --> 1:31:25.453
Okay?

1:31:25.487 --> 1:31:28.256
That's the truth.

1:31:28.289 --> 1:31:29.724
I'll take a lie detector.

1:31:32.293 --> 1:31:33.728
Did you kill Griff?

1:31:33.761 --> 1:31:34.896
No.

1:31:40.969 --> 1:31:44.672
I had to take an Uber home
from the hospital.

1:31:44.706 --> 1:31:46.441
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1:31:46.474 --> 1:31:47.742
Where are you?

1:31:47.775 --> 1:31:50.144
She got me arrested.

1:31:50.178 --> 1:31:52.847
Well, what did you do?

1:31:52.881 --> 1:31:53.681
Nothing.

1:31:54.983 --> 1:31:56.284
<i>Are you on your way home?</i>

1:31:56.317 --> 1:31:58.052
Yes.

1:31:58.086 --> 1:31:59.988
Honey?

1:32:00.021 --> 1:32:02.857
Lock the door.

1:32:02.891 --> 1:32:04.492
Uh.

1:32:29.117 --> 1:32:31.419
No charges.

1:32:31.452 --> 1:32:32.854
Thank you.

1:32:32.887 --> 1:32:34.322
But don't leave town.

1:32:46.035 --> 1:32:49.337
Did you know Malibu means
loud surf in Chumash?

1:32:49.370 --> 1:32:50.872
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

1:32:50.905 --> 1:32:52.173
Looking for a hammer.

1:32:53.408 --> 1:32:54.609
Cute.

1:32:54.642 --> 1:32:55.777
Oh my God, oh my...

1:32:56.511 --> 1:32:58.780
Ah!

1:33:03.651 --> 1:33:06.055
Domestic dogs are members
of the genus canis,

1:33:06.087 --> 1:33:08.790
they're carnivores,
you know descended from wolves.

1:33:08.823 --> 1:33:11.626
So even the smallest,
cuddliest little pup

1:33:11.659 --> 1:33:13.928
can smell meat
from 40 feet away.

1:33:13.962 --> 1:33:15.797
So if you leave it out,

1:33:15.830 --> 1:33:19.634
they're gonna get to it
everywhere in fact.

1:33:19.667 --> 1:33:21.369
Even the driveway.

1:33:56.304 --> 1:33:59.474
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh.

1:33:59.507 --> 1:34:01.309
Yeah, you ready now, aren't you?

1:34:01.342 --> 1:34:02.343
You about to die!

1:34:02.377 --> 1:34:03.411
Get some pounding, huh?

1:34:03.444 --> 1:34:04.879
Are you ready to die, boy?

1:34:04.912 --> 1:34:05.847
Huh?

1:34:09.217 --> 1:34:12.420
Look at you,
this is too easy, boy!

1:34:17.692 --> 1:34:18.826
Remember me, motherfucker!

1:34:18.860 --> 1:34:20.228
Huh?
Remember me?

1:34:20.261 --> 1:34:21.996
No, motherfucker!

1:34:22.031 --> 1:34:22.997
Come on!

1:34:33.008 --> 1:34:36.111
I'm gonna make you my bitch
right now!

1:34:56.197 --> 1:34:57.632
Honey, okay, okay.

1:34:57.665 --> 1:34:58.366
Okay.

1:34:58.399 --> 1:35:00.102
Mom, I'm home.

1:35:04.706 --> 1:35:05.373
Oh.

1:35:05.406 --> 1:35:07.208
Oh my God.

1:35:37.338 --> 1:35:39.141
Sure beats a match.

1:35:39.174 --> 1:35:40.241
Didn't matter.

1:35:40.274 --> 1:35:41.709
She was so drugged up,
I could have burned

1:35:41.743 --> 1:35:44.912
the whole house down
before she even woke.

1:35:44.946 --> 1:35:46.748
You killed my mother.

1:35:46.781 --> 1:35:50.318
Patricia didn't leave me
much choice now, did she?

1:35:50.351 --> 1:35:55.224
Without your mother,
I would still have my house,

1:35:55.256 --> 1:35:57.325
my husband would have
never gotten custody,

1:35:57.358 --> 1:36:01.896
my... my boy would still be home
safe with me.

1:36:03.397 --> 1:36:06.701
And I never would've had
to mess with those damn brakes.

1:36:06.734 --> 1:36:10.038
Your son was in the car.

1:36:10.072 --> 1:36:12.940
Roman was supposed
to be in school that day.

1:36:12.974 --> 1:36:15.010
He had a fever.

1:36:15.043 --> 1:36:18.113
And they called Steven
to pick him up.

1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:20.681
Oh, you're crazy.

1:36:20.715 --> 1:36:21.816
And crazy can't win!

1:37:06.527 --> 1:37:08.996
Knox, help me!

1:38:54.902 --> 1:38:57.172
Help me please!

1:38:58.673 --> 1:39:00.975
Help me!

1:39:02.810 --> 1:39:04.979
Mommy!

1:43:25.574 --> 1:43:28.976
Hi, have you considered selling?

1:43:29.010 --> 1:43:30.178
Hmm?

1:43:30.212 --> 1:43:32.013
Best house on the water.
