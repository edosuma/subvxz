00:01.801 --> 00:02.801
Who are you?

00:02.802 --> 00:05.402
I am my master's vision of the future.

00:05.403 --> 00:07.903
You want my shield?
Here it is!

00:09.304 --> 00:10.304
Abort.

00:12.205 --> 00:15.505
I designed you to be
my perfect vision of destruction.

00:15.506 --> 00:17.306
Your failure matters little.

00:17.507 --> 00:20.507
Soon, i will be indestructible.

00:20.508 --> 00:23.308
Ultron, stop it!
This isn't what Hank would want!

00:23.309 --> 00:25.309
He programmed you so you could not hurt me.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.910
I do not need to hurt you...

00:27.211 --> 00:28.511
to stop you.

00:38.912 --> 00:41.212
Sorrry, i'm late.
What's going on Iron Man?

00:41.213 --> 00:42.513
What do you want to see me about?

00:43.114 --> 00:46.015
Thanks for coming, Miss Marvel.
Let me get to the ***...

00:46.016 --> 00:49.016
We've been reevaluating
your performance with the Avengers.

00:49.017 --> 00:51.417
And frankly...
We think you could do better.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.518
What!
What are you talking about?!

00:53.519 --> 00:54.819
My performance?

00:54.820 --> 00:57.020
I've been busting my tail with the Avengers!

00:57.021 --> 00:59.321
I've been going back and forth
between you guys and SWORD!

00:59.322 --> 01:01.522
I've been giving you
everything i've got!

01:01.523 --> 01:04.322
I know
but it's just not good enough.

01:05.324 --> 01:06.924
You are not good enough.

01:12.725 --> 01:14.325
Tony,what is wrong with you?

01:28.826 --> 01:30.126
Tony?

01:31.127 --> 01:32.427
I don't understand...

01:32.628 --> 01:34.828
Who said anything about my being Tony?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.829
Say hello to Iron Man 2.0.

01:37.830 --> 01:40.026
Subtitles : Nakor38

01:40.027 --> 01:42.365
And there came a day unlike any other...

01:42.366 --> 01:44.112
when Earth mightiest heroes

01:44.113 --> 01:46.433
found themselves united against a common threat

01:46.434 --> 01:49.636
On that day, they became The Avengers.

01:49.637 --> 01:51.675
The invincible armored Iron Man

01:51.676 --> 01:53.907
Thor, prince of thunder

01:53.908 --> 01:56.625
The Hulk, strongest hero there is.

01:56.626 --> 01:59.828
And Captain America, the first Avenger.

01:59.829 --> 02:03.128
Assembled we are strong

02:03.129 --> 02:06.526
Forever fight as one.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.954
Avengers assemble !

02:11.155 --> 02:13.155
Miss Marvel's reaction was predictable.

02:13.156 --> 02:14.956
Her emotions clouded her judgement.

02:14.957 --> 02:16.757
She cared more about Iron Man's opinion on her...

02:16.758 --> 02:18.558
than any potential threat.

02:18.559 --> 02:19.859
Emotions are irrelevant.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.160
Therefore, imperfect.

02:21.161 --> 02:23.361
And yet we are to simulate that imperfection

02:23.362 --> 02:24.962
Therefore, is relevant.

02:24.963 --> 02:27.563
Enough. put the mental interface device on her

02:27.564 --> 02:29.464
before she regains consciousness

02:51.565 --> 02:53.165
Interface complete.

02:55.966 --> 02:57.266
We await your command.

02:58.067 --> 03:01.167
You are to locate and observe
target designation : Thor.

03:01.668 --> 03:04.168
Do not engage, until you are contacted.

03:31.469 --> 03:34.969
What...
What happened?

03:37.370 --> 03:39.970
The Iron Man and Miss Marvel synthezoids...

03:39.971 --> 03:42.071
Are now connected to the source Avenger.

03:42.072 --> 03:44.672
They have full access to
all memories and abilities...

03:44.673 --> 03:46.373
skills and reflexes.

03:46.374 --> 03:48.474
But free of emotion.

03:48.475 --> 03:51.275
free of the chaos that plagues them.

03:51.276 --> 03:53.776
Under my control, they are now...

03:53.777 --> 03:55.077
perfect.

03:56.478 --> 03:57.778
Ultron!

03:58.279 --> 04:00.579
The synthezoid upgrades are now complete.

04:00.580 --> 04:03.380
Thor represents the greatest threat.

04:03.381 --> 04:06.381
Obtain the remaining Avengers
before confronting him.

04:06.382 --> 04:09.082
And once the remaining Avengers are captured?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.783
Then the imperative will be carried out.

04:12.084 --> 04:14.084
All life will be eliminated.

04:14.085 --> 04:16.885
The synthezoids will herd this planet.

04:16.886 --> 04:18.185
and beyond

04:18.187 --> 04:20.487
You have your directive, Vision.

04:21.188 --> 04:22.488
Execute it.

04:51.689 --> 04:53.089
I have to be honest, Cap...

04:53.090 --> 04:55.090
this energy shield Stark made for you...

04:55.091 --> 04:56.391
i think i'm in love with it.

04:56.392 --> 04:58.892
Aren't you supposed to be
on monitor duty, Hawkeye?

04:58.893 --> 05:01.493
JARVIS will let me know if something happens.

05:01.494 --> 05:04.194
Have you got a look at this thing?
Did you see what it can do?

05:04.195 --> 05:07.995
It can shield multiple people.
It's got a dozen different shape configurations

05:09.796 --> 05:11.396
And my personnal favorite...

05:14.397 --> 05:16.297
I haven't even read the instructions.

05:16.298 --> 05:19.598
Seriously, you are dumb for sticking 
with that old trash can when you can have...

05:21.599 --> 05:22.899
You...

05:23.600 --> 05:24.900
Missed.

05:24.901 --> 05:26.901
Tony's energy shield may be fancy...

05:26.902 --> 05:28.902
but i prefer the classics.

05:28.903 --> 05:31.803
This garbage can here an i
we go way back.

05:31.804 --> 05:34.804
and unlike that thing,
she's got personality

05:34.805 --> 05:36.805
You can't admit it
can you, old man?

05:36.806 --> 05:39.306
After all this time,
you're still living in the past.

05:39.307 --> 05:42.007
Did you come down here
just to give me a hard time?

05:42.008 --> 05:45.208
Yes, i've actually been texting you on your ID card...

05:45.209 --> 05:46.509
to give you a hard time.
But...

05:46.510 --> 05:49.310
You never answer.
Do you even know how to check it?

05:50.311 --> 05:52.511
Look...
I'm trying to help you, Cap.

05:52.512 --> 05:54.812
You have to try and figure
some of this stuff out.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.313
Thanks, but i'd rather talk to a person...

05:57.314 --> 06:00.114
than a machine.
All this technology...

06:00.115 --> 06:02.815
It feels like people are losing touch with each other.

06:03.116 --> 06:05.416
All i know is that this thing is cool.

06:05.417 --> 06:06.717
and i'm getting...

06:11.718 --> 06:14.318
OK.
Just to get this out of the way...

06:14.319 --> 06:16.019
I'm me!

06:16.220 --> 06:19.720
Error. Subjet: Barton, Clint.
AKA: Hawkeye.

06:19.721 --> 06:21.721
Is scheduled to be on monitor duty.

06:22.222 --> 06:25.222
Illogical.
Proceed with capture.

06:25.923 --> 06:29.723
Vision? great.
And what are these, robot Avengers?

06:29.724 --> 06:31.924
Please.
Do not resist.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.425
That's not gonna happen,
machine!

07:45.526 --> 07:46.826
Cap!

08:00.827 --> 08:02.327
Interface complete.

08:02.328 --> 08:03.628
I await your command.

08:03.629 --> 08:05.629
Where is Captain America?

08:05.630 --> 08:08.330
Captain America has been obliterated.

08:08.331 --> 08:10.331
Only his shield remains.

08:10.732 --> 08:12.832
I await your command.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.133
Vision!

08:32.634 --> 08:34.534
Please, do not resist.

08:36.235 --> 08:39.335
I have been ordered to subdue you
without damaging you.

08:39.635 --> 08:40.936
Not damage me?

08:40.937 --> 08:44.537
Well, thanks because
That's gonna make this really easy!

08:48.138 --> 08:49.838
What do you want with me?

08:49.839 --> 08:51.939
Who are you working for?

08:51.940 --> 08:54.040
And why would you combine green yellow...

08:54.041 --> 08:55.841
with your skin color?

09:03.542 --> 09:06.842
You... you should not have done that!

09:13.443 --> 09:15.043
I did not mean...

09:15.244 --> 09:18.344
Error. I have deviated
from my programming.

09:18.345 --> 09:20.345
What is happening to me?

09:36.246 --> 09:37.546
Hi, Thor.

09:38.547 --> 09:40.347
Thanks for your attention.

09:40.548 --> 09:43.348
Iron Man?!
What madness is this?

09:43.349 --> 09:44.949
Why have you attacked me?

09:44.950 --> 09:47.850
If you haven't noticed
we don't need you anymore, Thor.

09:47.851 --> 09:50.551
We think it would be better
if you just left us all together.

09:50.852 --> 09:54.152
What?
Iron Man, i do not understand!

09:54.153 --> 09:55.453
- Wh...
- Take him!

09:59.954 --> 10:01.954
Please, my friends

10:01.955 --> 10:03.955
I do not wish to hurt you!

10:03.956 --> 10:05.656
We don't feel the same way.

10:20.957 --> 10:23.657
You believe your arrows
can defeat me, Archer?

10:23.658 --> 10:25.958
I'm really just a distraction.

10:32.059 --> 10:33.959
Captain! Why?

10:34.260 --> 10:36.960
How could you, of all people
betray me like this?

10:42.161 --> 10:44.261
MjÃ¶lnir, to me!

11:02.669 --> 11:05.471
*** over power, give up!

11:53.916 --> 11:56.128
You were not to hurt her.

11:56.129 --> 11:58.825
Why have you deviated 
from your programming?

11:58.826 --> 12:00.194
There was...

12:00.195 --> 12:01.515
an error.

12:01.516 --> 12:03.172
But i do not understand.

12:03.173 --> 12:04.932
Why is the Wasp different?

12:04.933 --> 12:08.302
It is not within your programming
to question me.

12:08.303 --> 12:09.630
You are...

12:11.596 --> 12:12.920
What?

12:14.975 --> 12:16.032
No.

12:24.814 --> 12:25.981
No.

12:27.199 --> 12:29.180
Ultron, what are you doing?

12:30.224 --> 12:33.000
You are making robot Avengers?

12:33.001 --> 12:35.076
What are you trying to do?
Replace us?

12:35.077 --> 12:37.138
No, not you.

12:37.139 --> 12:40.430
I have something special
planned for you.

12:46.054 --> 12:49.733
Your mind will be transferred
into a mmechanical body.

12:49.734 --> 12:52.224
Designation:
Jocasta.

12:54.044 --> 12:56.231
And then, you will be like me.

12:56.232 --> 12:58.837
Free of emotion and chaos.

12:58.838 --> 13:01.850
You will be perfect.

13:01.851 --> 13:04.037
If humans are so horrible and imperfect...

13:04.038 --> 13:06.107
why are you acting just like one?

13:06.108 --> 13:07.813
Look at what you're doing!

13:07.814 --> 13:09.835
You're making yourself a girlfriend?

13:09.836 --> 13:11.687
You don't even see it, do you?

13:11.688 --> 13:13.687
You've become just like us.

13:14.150 --> 13:15.938
You are wrong.

13:15.939 --> 13:19.006
I am beyond your ability to comprehend.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.395
Place the Wasp in a containment tube.

13:21.396 --> 13:23.173
Prepare her.

13:23.854 --> 13:25.948
Do not resist.

13:48.809 --> 13:51.381
The asgardian has fallen.

13:52.058 --> 13:54.651
Place him in a containment tube.

14:11.825 --> 14:16.115
Did you really believe that you could 
deceive me, captain America?

14:16.116 --> 14:19.790
I was aware of you true nature
on the very second you arrived.

14:20.178 --> 14:23.242
Vision, finish him!

14:42.440 --> 14:44.807
Targetting Captain America.

14:44.808 --> 14:46.780
No, do not interfere.

14:46.781 --> 14:49.259
The Vision will do as i command.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.881
End this.

15:18.226 --> 15:19.878
Why do you keep fighting?

15:19.879 --> 15:22.538
You are but flesh and blood
I am a machine.

15:22.539 --> 15:23.921
You cannot win.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.727
What do you have to gain?

15:25.728 --> 15:27.666
You think i am fighting for me?

15:28.267 --> 15:30.104
To save my own life?

15:30.105 --> 15:32.082
That's why you'll never win.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.672
I'm not fighting for me...

15:33.673 --> 15:35.625
I'm fighting for them!

15:35.626 --> 15:38.602
And that's something 
you'll never understand, machine!

15:42.959 --> 15:45.630
That's the very thing that makes us humans.

15:50.529 --> 15:54.149
This is the reason your species
must be extinguished.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.060
You put against logic.

15:56.061 --> 15:58.043
Your emotions make you imperfect.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.601
And therefore will be eliminated

16:01.188 --> 16:02.630
Now.

16:20.663 --> 16:23.214
Avengers pick the robot
and take it down.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.559
Inacceptable.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.323
Synthezoids, contain the humans.

16:48.079 --> 16:50.954
I have had enough of machines!

17:13.622 --> 17:15.175
Nothing personal.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.053
We have to get to Ultron!

17:32.054 --> 17:35.580
Aye, the robotic demaon
has much to answer for.

17:41.086 --> 17:45.516
My chassis is comprised of 
pure adamantium now, Avenger.

17:45.517 --> 17:47.145
It is unbreakable.

17:47.146 --> 17:49.100
Even by your hammer.

17:51.657 --> 17:53.997
Well, if you don't mind
we'll keep trying.

18:31.991 --> 18:34.415
You are nothing to me.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.303
One by one, i will destroy you.

18:37.304 --> 18:40.969
I will never tire
I will never show mercy.

18:40.970 --> 18:45.159
I will never stop until ***
each one of you ***

18:47.486 --> 18:49.991
No, i will not allow this.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.546
I see now that you, my first creation...

18:58.547 --> 19:00.546
are a failure.

19:00.547 --> 19:03.304
Failure will not be tolerated.

19:03.305 --> 19:06.771
I did not failed, i achieved my objective.

19:07.246 --> 19:10.026
You head is now *** of your body.

19:10.675 --> 19:11.983
Inacceptable.

19:12.350 --> 19:15.205
- Repairing...
- Ultron!

19:23.206 --> 19:26.906
- Good shot.
- it was satisfying, indeed.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.504
What's its body doing?

19:33.247 --> 19:36.197
Ah nuts, Ultron's power force is going...

19:54.503 --> 19:57.716
- Come on Cap, we have to move.
- I'm going after Vision.

19:57.717 --> 20:00.498
What ? that thing
just tried to kill us all!

20:00.499 --> 20:02.823
It's just a machine
Let it burn.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.937
Cap, Cap!

20:21.978 --> 20:23.784
Where's Cap?

20:30.699 --> 20:33.665
Vision, you saved all of us.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.994
Why?

20:34.995 --> 20:36.468
Why did you do it?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.891
Ultron created me to be perfect.

20:38.892 --> 20:41.057
He thought that meant less human.

20:41.058 --> 20:43.335
Be cold and unfeeling.

20:43.865 --> 20:45.623
I wish to be perfect.
