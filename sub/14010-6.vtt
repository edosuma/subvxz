<i>Previously on</i> Damages...

00:05.078 --> 00:05.941
McCLAREN: I provide...

00:05.943 --> 00:09.511
a safe haven for whistle-blowers who
want to get information to the public.

00:09.513 --> 00:11.693
SIMON: We can guarantee
your anonymity.

00:11.695 --> 00:15.096
DAVIES: I don't know what you fucking
did, Naomi... but we're all dead.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.062
Everything came out of
your goddamn computer.

"Personal e-mails reveal
trader's sexcapades."

00:20.901 --> 00:23.035
HEWES: Last night Naomi
Walling took her own life.

00:23.037 --> 00:26.177
PARSONS: How did Ms . Walling's
information get out there?

00:26.179 --> 00:29.713
McCLAREN: I don't know but it is
very bad for my organization.

00:29.715 --> 00:33.019
RACHEL: McClaren destroys my mother's
life and he gets to just walk away?

00:33.021 --> 00:35.956
My mom told me that
she and McClaren met.

00:35.958 --> 00:39.529
HEWES: Are you saying your mother had
a sexual relationship with McClaren?

00:39.531 --> 00:40.564
RACHEL: Yes.

00:40.566 --> 00:42.869
McCLAREN: I met Naomi
Walling twice.

00:42.871 --> 00:45.138
We had absolutely no
physical contact.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.206
I did not assault her.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.474
HEWES: What can I do for you?

00:47.476 --> 00:50.644
Well, I just thought you should
know that he wants to talk to you.

00:50.646 --> 00:52.513
You look so much
like your mother.

00:52.515 --> 00:54.315
HEWES: All the facts of
the case are in question.

00:54.317 --> 00:57.551
So if the facts won't win
it or lose it, what will?

00:57.553 --> 00:59.223
PARSONS: One of us.

you a bourbon?

01:14.205 --> 01:15.470
PARSONS: No, thank you.

01:15.472 --> 01:17.705
HEWES: Are you sure?

01:17.707 --> 01:20.974
PARSONS: I'm sure.

01:20.976 --> 01:22.776
Why did you call me?

01:22.778 --> 01:27.348
HEWES: I didn't call you,
Ellen, you called me.

01:27.350 --> 01:29.515
PARSONS: I did?

01:29.517 --> 01:33.151
HEWES: You told me you
wanted to take a bath.

01:33.153 --> 01:35.120
PARSONS: Why would I say that?

01:35.122 --> 01:36.588
HEWES: I have no idea.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.224
But let me be very clear...

01:38.226 --> 01:40.293
I didn't invite you here.

01:40.295 --> 01:43.563
You came on your own.

01:43.565 --> 01:48.669
So why don't you
just take a bath.

01:48.671 --> 01:50.304
PARSONS: No.

01:50.306 --> 01:52.573
HEWES: Come on up.

02:03.086 --> 02:05.621
Isn't this what you wanted?

02:09.727 --> 02:11.861
It's all right, Ellen.

02:15.499 --> 02:17.700
There's nothing to worry about.

02:31.515 --> 02:34.917
Ellen.

02:34.919 --> 02:36.986
Ellen.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.607
DAVID: Come in with me.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.643
(water sloshing)

03:03.948 --> 03:05.382
PARSONS: I can't.

03:05.384 --> 03:07.185
I was attacked.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.455
DAVID (laughs): You're fine.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.157
You look beautiful.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.665
You see?

03:24.870 --> 03:28.807
Now come in with me.

NAOMI: You, too.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.354
McCLAREN: Sorry about this.

05:24.356 --> 05:26.456
I've learned it's
better to be discreet.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.690
NAOMI: No, I understand.

05:27.692 --> 05:29.259
Thank you for coming.

05:29.261 --> 05:30.294
Sit.

05:30.296 --> 05:33.197
Do you want a drink
or something?

05:33.199 --> 05:34.165
McCLAREN: No, thanks.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.200
Do you mind if I smoke?

05:36.202 --> 05:38.269
NAOMI: No. Go ahead.

05:53.585 --> 05:54.818
HERNDON: Okay we found him.

05:54.820 --> 05:55.819
HEWES: Who?

05:55.821 --> 05:57.888
HERNDON: The hotel guest that
was staying in the room

05:57.890 --> 05:59.023
next to Naomi and McClaren.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.524
HEWES: Thomas Schultz?

06:00.526 --> 06:03.227
HERNDON: No. You see, that's
why we couldn't find him

06:03.229 --> 06:06.330
because Schultz was just the name
that he used to check in with.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.865
His real name is Thomas Weld.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.368
Our investigator
tracked him down.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.403
HEWES: Have you
contacted Mr. Weld?

06:12.405 --> 06:13.471
HERNDON: Well, I tried.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.472
There's no response.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.508
I mean, you've got to figure
a guy who goes around using

06:16.510 --> 06:18.577
a fake name is in no
rush to talk to lawyers.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.846
HEWES: So where can I find him?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.280
HERNDON: Okay, Thomas Weld.

06:22.282 --> 06:26.051
Married, two children, insurance
executive, works in a firm on 34th Street.

06:26.053 --> 06:30.021
Apparently has lunch every day
at a diner opposite his office.

06:31.791 --> 06:36.295
FRANKLIN: Well, we owe Patty
an updated witness list.

06:36.297 --> 06:38.397
Here's our latest.

06:41.334 --> 06:45.504
PARSONS: What happened to the guy...
at the hotel?

06:45.506 --> 06:48.975
The guest who was staying in the
room next to Naomi Walling's?

06:48.977 --> 06:50.476
FRANKLIN: Oh, Thomas Schultz.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.379
Mt. Schultz has been impossible
to find, and according to the

06:53.381 --> 06:55.782
manager at the hotel,
he hasn't been back.

06:55.784 --> 06:59.085
Either he doesn't want to talk to us or
he's dropped off the face of the earth.

06:59.087 --> 07:02.322
PARSONS: Keep looking.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.259
What else have we got?

07:06.261 --> 07:09.662
FRANKLIN: The judge has granted us
access to Naomi Walling's apartment.

07:09.664 --> 07:12.966
PARSONS: I'm not sure
what we would find there.

07:12.968 --> 07:15.802
FRANKLIN: Well, it
wouldn't hurt to look.

07:15.804 --> 07:18.272
Rachel Welling
hasn't sold it yet.

07:18.274 --> 07:21.876
Naomi might've left
something useful behind.

07:24.246 --> 07:26.347
PARSONS: Naomi killed
herself in the tub.

07:26.349 --> 07:28.649
FRANKLIN: Yeah.

07:28.651 --> 07:31.719
PARSONS: I'd like
to look around.

07:31.721 --> 07:33.887
See exactly where it happened.

07:57.613 --> 08:01.249
WELD: Can I help you?

08:10.426 --> 08:14.196
HEWES: If your name is
Thomas Weld you can.

08:14.198 --> 08:15.764
WELD: It is.

08:15.766 --> 08:19.402
HEWES: May I?

08:19.404 --> 08:21.471
WELD: Who are you?

08:24.576 --> 08:26.377
HEWES: Patty Hewes.

08:26.379 --> 08:27.545
I'm an attorney.

08:27.547 --> 08:30.215
My office has been trying
to get a hold of you.

08:30.217 --> 08:31.483
WELD: Jesus Christ.

08:31.485 --> 08:34.085
HEWES: I want to talk to you
about a night you spent at the

08:34.087 --> 08:36.121
Montclair Hotel.

08:37.789 --> 08:39.124
WELD: Sorry, can't help you.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.493
I've never stayed there.

08:41.495 --> 08:44.029
HEWES: Well, Thomas Schultz has.

08:44.030 --> 08:48.767
Should I be talking to him?

08:48.769 --> 08:53.071
Mr. Weld, I don't care why you checked
into a hotel under a false name.

08:53.073 --> 08:56.142
And I certainly don't care
what you were doing there.

08:56.144 --> 09:01.381
But you could be a very important
witness in a case I'm trying.

09:01.383 --> 09:02.916
WELD: I doubt it.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.985
I've never seen anything
unusual over there.

09:04.987 --> 09:08.455
HEWES: You were staying in a
room next to an assault victim.

09:08.457 --> 09:11.659
I just want you to come in
and answer a few questions.

09:11.661 --> 09:13.761
WELD: And if I don't?

09:13.763 --> 09:17.598
HEWES: I'll subpoena you.

09:17.600 --> 09:23.304
So one way or another you and
I are going to have a chat.

09:27.977 --> 09:32.446
WELD: If I talk to you, I
want my attorney present.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.248
HEWES: Of course.

09:34.250 --> 09:38.352
My office will set it up.

09:52.165 --> 09:54.800
FRANKLIN: Feels strange being
in this apartment knowing

09:54.802 --> 09:57.102
a woman killed herself in here.

10:01.074 --> 10:05.110
Okay, where do we start?

10:05.112 --> 10:09.081
PARSONS: Look for Naomi's
personal papers.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.751
FRANKLIN: Anything
in particular?

10:12.753 --> 10:14.786
PARSONS: Files,
letters, receipts.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.021
Maybe she kept a journal.

10:16.023 --> 10:16.988
FRANKLIN: Okay.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.023
I'll check it out.

10:18.025 --> 10:20.225
PARSONS: I'm gonna
look for the bathroom.

10:20.227 --> 10:24.295
That's where Rachel found her.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.502
(door creaks open)

11:04.870 --> 11:08.940
(panting)

11:11.510 --> 11:12.476
(retching)

11:12.478 --> 11:13.444
FRANKLIN: Ellen?

11:13.446 --> 11:16.580
Ellen.

11:16.582 --> 11:17.581
You okay?

11:17.583 --> 11:18.582
You okay?

11:18.584 --> 11:19.583
PARSONS: Yeah.

11:19.585 --> 11:21.684
FRANKLIN: Did you hurt yourself?

11:21.686 --> 11:22.685
PARSONS: No. (sighs)

11:22.687 --> 11:23.686
FRANKLIN: Come on.

11:24.690 --> 11:26.216
There you go.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.226
FRANKLIN: You okay?

11:30.228 --> 11:31.227
PARSONS: Yeah.

11:31.229 --> 11:32.228
FRANKLIN: Come on.

11:32.230 --> 11:35.264
Let's get some air.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.101
Do you want to sit down?

11:39.103 --> 11:41.070
PARSONS: No, I'm fine.

11:41.072 --> 11:43.439
FRANKLIN: Did you
have breakfast?

11:43.441 --> 11:46.709
Always knocks me for a loop
if I don't have breakfast.

11:46.711 --> 11:48.978
PARSONS: Oh, it's
all right, really.

11:48.980 --> 11:53.049
FRANKLIN: Come here. Here.

11:57.021 --> 12:00.424
Here, drink this.

12:05.930 --> 12:08.165
You okay?

12:08.167 --> 12:10.200
PARSONS: Yeah. Yeah.

12:10.202 --> 12:19.341
Just... Being in that bathroom...
Just have a bad memory.

12:19.343 --> 12:23.312
FRANKLIN: This memory--
was it about your fiancé?

12:23.314 --> 12:25.548
I read about it.

12:25.550 --> 12:30.252
Frobisher and...
I know you found David in the tub.

12:30.254 --> 12:31.454
I'm sorry.

12:31.456 --> 12:32.588
Shouldn't have brought it up.

12:32.590 --> 12:36.159
PARSONS: It was a long time ago.

12:36.161 --> 12:40.229
FRANKLIN: Sure you're okay?

12:42.466 --> 12:45.536
PARSONS: Yeah.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.641
SIMON: So, apparently, the
Chairman of the Board is

12:50.643 --> 12:55.012
sleeping with not one, but two
key operational managers.

12:55.014 --> 12:56.647
McCLAREN: No.

12:56.649 --> 12:59.817
NOVAK: Here's one about falsified testing
at a major vitamin manufacturer.

12:59.819 --> 13:00.818
McCLAREN: No.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.387
NOVAK: Okay.

13:03.389 --> 13:07.058
A national managed care facility
is hiring illegal aliens.

13:07.060 --> 13:09.994
McCLAREN: Seriously, this
is all that's coming in?

13:09.996 --> 13:12.330
SIMON: Unless you've
fielding anything.

13:12.332 --> 13:13.364
McCLAREN: No.

13:13.366 --> 13:15.600
No one's contacted me.

13:15.602 --> 13:16.968
I'm a fucking pariah.

13:16.970 --> 13:21.506
SIMON: This lawsuit's totally
trashed our reputation.

13:21.508 --> 13:22.507
Nobody trusts us.

13:22.509 --> 13:24.876
NOVAK: This is all because
of Naomi Walling.

13:24.878 --> 13:26.144
I knew that cunt was trouble.

13:26.146 --> 13:28.781
SIMON: Well, then, you should
have shown us your crystal ball.

13:28.783 --> 13:30.749
NOVAK: She was a star fucker.

13:30.751 --> 13:35.087
McCLAREN: I'm going
to talk to Ellen.

13:35.089 --> 13:37.190
Let's settle this case.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.960
(Simon sighs)

13:39.962 --> 13:42.463
PARSONS: So you want to offer
her three million dollars?

13:42.465 --> 13:43.464
McCLAREN: Yes.

13:43.466 --> 13:46.834
PARSONS: And what makes you think that
Patty Hewes is interested in settling?

13:46.836 --> 13:49.037
McCLAREN: You said
her case is weak.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.238
PARSONS: It doesn't matter.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.473
She's not after money.

13:52.475 --> 13:54.542
I told you that before.

13:54.544 --> 13:57.512
She wants to decimate you,
put you out of business.

13:57.514 --> 13:58.613
Forever.

13:58.615 --> 14:01.816
McCLAREN: Well, if we don't
settle, she may get her wish.

14:01.818 --> 14:04.519
SIMON: Look, we are
dead in the water.

14:04.521 --> 14:08.456
Channing's exposure is killing our sources,
which in turn, is killing our Web site.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.458
PARSONS: Settling will
only make things worse.

14:10.460 --> 14:14.263
It'll look like you're paying
someone off because you're guilty.

14:14.265 --> 14:16.832
SIMON: So what do you
suggest we do then?

14:16.834 --> 14:20.235
PARSONS: Patty beats
you by outlasting you.

14:20.237 --> 14:23.605
Making you desperate,
backing you into a corner.

14:23.607 --> 14:25.975
SIMON: We are in a
corner right now.

14:25.977 --> 14:27.010
PARSON: Exactly.

14:27.012 --> 14:29.479
Her case may be weak, but
she's winning the mind game.

14:29.481 --> 14:35.551
The fact that you're even considering
paying Rachel Walling proves it.

14:35.553 --> 14:37.887
My game plan is simple.

14:37.889 --> 14:41.824
We take her punches, tire her
out, outlast her, and then,

14:41.826 --> 14:45.795
we beat her in court.

14:45.797 --> 14:51.801
It's the only way
to clear your name.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.170
Trust me.

14:54.172 --> 14:57.273
RACHEL: I really needed
this, so, thanks, guys.

14:57.275 --> 14:58.274
Cheers.

14:58.276 --> 14:59.242
Cheers.

14:59.244 --> 15:00.376

15:00.378 --> 15:01.711
This has been so wonderful.

15:01.713 --> 15:03.714
DAVIES: Rachel.

15:03.716 --> 15:04.715
RACHEL: Mr. Davies.

15:04.717 --> 15:05.715
DAVIES: I'm so sorry.

15:05.717 --> 15:10.887
I-I-I... I never got a chance to
tell you how bad I felt about

15:10.889 --> 15:12.088
what happened to your mother.

15:12.090 --> 15:13.056
RACHEL: Thank you.

15:13.058 --> 15:14.091
DAVIES: How you doing?

15:14.093 --> 15:15.559
I mean, how you holding up?

15:15.561 --> 15:18.062
You keeping it together?

15:18.064 --> 15:19.096
RACHEL: I'm all right.

15:19.098 --> 15:20.197
DAVIES: I'm sorry. Excuse me.

15:20.199 --> 15:21.499
Can I just get a minute?

15:21.501 --> 15:23.734
I just need a moment with
Rachel, pretty please?

15:23.736 --> 15:24.735
Yeah?

15:24.737 --> 15:25.737
RACHEL: It's-it's okay.

He's a friend.

15:26.773 --> 15:27.772
Oh.

15:27.774 --> 15:28.873
DAVIES: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:28.875 --> 15:29.875
All right.

15:29.877 --> 15:30.876
DAVIES: Oh, absolutely.

15:30.878 --> 15:32.110
Thank you all. Thank you.

15:32.112 --> 15:35.414
Appreciate that. Great.

15:35.416 --> 15:36.482
Super.

15:36.484 --> 15:41.053
Can you believe...
I just got out on bail?

15:41.055 --> 15:42.655
One point two million.

15:42.657 --> 15:45.524
I mean, that's kind of hard to
put together when all your

15:45.526 --> 15:46.492
assets are frozen.

15:46.494 --> 15:50.195
It's not like I had sacks of
money all around the house.

15:50.197 --> 15:53.398
Mr. Moneysack-ajuhweeuh.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.399
(laughs)

15:54.401 --> 15:55.400
Get it?

15:55.402 --> 15:56.368
(Davies laughs)

15:56.370 --> 15:58.403
RACHEL: You, okay, Mr. Davies?

15:58.405 --> 15:59.404
DAVIES: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:59.406 --> 16:01.372
Hey, this is a
fucking nice spot.

16:01.374 --> 16:02.340
Little expensive, though.

16:02.342 --> 16:07.210
- Mr. Davies, I really... I should...
- No, no, no. Uh, uh.

16:07.212 --> 16:08.211
You deserve this.

16:08.213 --> 16:09.412
You do.

16:09.414 --> 16:10.781
What are you having to drink?

16:10.783 --> 16:11.949
What is that, a Cosmopolitan?

16:11.951 --> 16:12.950
Excuse me?

16:12.952 --> 16:15.218
Can we get another Cosmo for
this beautiful young lady?

16:15.220 --> 16:16.219
RACHEL: No, I'm-I'm fine.

16:16.221 --> 16:17.854
DAVIES: I insist. It's on me.

16:17.856 --> 16:20.156
All right?

16:20.158 --> 16:21.157
It's because I'm loyal.

16:21.159 --> 16:24.160
It's 'cause I take
care of people.

16:24.162 --> 16:26.430
For example, your mom.

16:26.432 --> 16:30.467
You know, I gave your mom her
first job on Wall Street.

16:30.469 --> 16:32.602
You remember that, right?

16:32.604 --> 16:35.538
RACHEL: Yeah.

16:35.540 --> 16:39.542
DAVIES: Bet you I'd think twice
about doing that again, huh?

16:39.544 --> 16:40.543
Yeah.

16:40.545 --> 16:46.916
But your mother, no, she never
thought twice about anything.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.584
Or anyone.

16:48.586 --> 16:52.687
She just took us all down.

16:54.991 --> 16:58.060
Hey... (sighs)

16:58.062 --> 17:08.270
You know the difference...
between your mom and someone like me?

17:08.271 --> 17:11.740
All right, this is me.

17:11.742 --> 17:13.675
A stupid chump.

17:13.676 --> 17:17.444
For me, the money was
just a way to keep score.

17:17.446 --> 17:19.748
I mean, it could have
been fucking puka shells.

17:19.750 --> 17:20.714
You understand?

17:20.717 --> 17:22.916
But for your mom, whoa!

17:22.919 --> 17:26.854
Money was everything.

17:26.856 --> 17:30.124
She's what we call a whore.

17:30.126 --> 17:32.826
Sucking cock, counting cash.

17:32.828 --> 17:33.827
RACHEL: Excuse me.

17:33.829 --> 17:34.828
DAVIES: No.

17:34.830 --> 17:40.300
I'm sorry that your big fat little
inheritance isn't enough for you, Princess.

17:40.302 --> 17:43.036
You had to go out and
sue Channing McClaren?

17:43.038 --> 17:44.204
RACHEL: Let go of me.

17:44.206 --> 17:47.941
DAVIES: I hope this suit wins you
a barrel, a fucking fortune.

17:47.943 --> 17:48.942
RACHEL: Fuck you.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.010
DAVIES: Fuck you.

17:50.012 --> 17:51.345
You're just like your mother.

17:51.347 --> 17:55.416
Big twat.

17:57.352 --> 18:00.588
(crowd chatter)

18:06.495 --> 18:08.429
HERNDON: You recognize
this woman?

18:08.431 --> 18:09.964
THOMAS WELD: Yeah, of course.

18:09.966 --> 18:11.098
Naomi Walling.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.701
Her sex life was all
over the papers.

18:13.703 --> 18:15.970
I've followed the case
in the <i>Post.</i>

18:15.972 --> 18:18.773
<i>HEWES: On the day in
question, Ms. Walling was</i>

18:18.775 --> 18:20.942

<i>Did you have occasion to

18:43.832 --> 18:47.933
<i>(Weld sighs)</i>

18:49.903 --> 18:51.737
<i>WELD: Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, I remember this guy.</i>

18:52.906 --> 18:55.206
<i>I-I think he went
into Walling's room.</i>

18:55.208 --> 18:58.644
<i>HERNDON: After you checked in, did you
stay in your room the whole time?</i>

18:58.646 --> 18:59.611

18:59.613 --> 19:00.646
<i>HERNDON: Are you sure?</i>

19:00.648 --> 19:03.882
<i>Didn't wander out to the bar of
go out for an Orange Julius?</i>

19:03.884 --> 19:05.117
<i>WELD: I'm sure.</i>

19:05.119 --> 19:07.852
<i>I was in my room until I
checked out the next morning.</i>

you were doing in there?</i>

19:10.124 --> 19:12.357
<i>Mr. Weld is not here
to discuss that.</i>

19:12.359 --> 19:16.060

can serve as a witness for you.</i>

<i>You were next door.</i>

19:29.208 --> 19:31.208
<i>Did you hear anything at all?</i>

<i>WELD: No. I don't think so.</i>

19:33.179 --> 19:37.347
<i>HEWES: Mr. Weld, while you were
in your room, Ms. Walling</i>

19:37.349 --> 19:38.348
<i>was sexually assaulted.</i>

19:38.350 --> 19:41.919
<i>Not long afterwards,
she killed herself.</i>

25:43.590 --> 25:45.357
<i>What a nice surprise.</i>

25:45.359 --> 25:48.326
<i>Thanks for sharing
Chris with us.</i>

25:48.328 --> 25:50.562
<i>He's a welcome addition.</i>

25:50.564 --> 25:53.498
<i>You know, I haven't seen
you in quite some time.</i>

25:53.500 --> 25:56.167
<i>PARSONS: I know, must've
been a few years at least.</i>

25:56.169 --> 25:59.170
<i>Thought I'd stick my
head in and say hi.</i>

25:59.172 --> 26:00.504
<i>I'm glad you did.</i>

26:00.506 --> 26:02.039
<i>How you doing?</i>

26:02.041 --> 26:03.941
<i>PARSONS: I'm good.</i>

26:03.943 --> 26:07.010
<i>Really good. Yeah, thanks.</i>

26:07.012 --> 26:09.046
<i>It's nice to hear.</i>

26:09.048 --> 26:10.814
<i>SANCHEZ: You ready?</i>

26:10.816 --> 26:12.148
<i>PARSONS: Yeah, I'm all set.</i>

26:12.150 --> 26:13.016
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

26:13.018 --> 26:15.051
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>McCLAREN: How did you
learn to sing like that?</i>

28:16.109 --> 28:19.511
<i>RACHEL: Uh, I don't know.</i>

28:19.513 --> 28:20.645
<i>My mom, I guess.</i>

28:20.647 --> 28:22.447
<i>She loved music.</i>

28:22.449 --> 28:24.182
<i>McCLAREN: Are you religious?</i>

28:24.184 --> 28:27.552
<i>RACHEL: No, not really.
I just like singing.</i>

28:27.554 --> 28:29.621
<i>McCLAREN: So, can I take
you for coffee or...</i>

28:29.623 --> 28:33.391
<i>RACHEL: No. No.</i>

28:33.393 --> 28:37.061
<i>Look, I agreed to
meet with you,</i>

28:37.063 --> 28:42.100
<i>uh, but whatever you want
to say, say it here.</i>

28:45.337 --> 28:50.875
<i>McCLAREN: I wanted to talk
to you face-to-face.</i>

28:50.877 --> 28:58.450
<i>I am... deeply sorry for what
happened to your mother.</i>

29:00.420 --> 29:02.087
<i>I read your deposition.</i>

29:02.089 --> 29:05.524
<i>I know what she
told you about us.</i>

29:05.526 --> 29:07.392
<i>About me.</i>

29:07.394 --> 29:09.528
<i>But that's not what
really happened.</i>

29:09.530 --> 29:11.029
<i>RACHEL: Bullshit.</i>

29:11.031 --> 29:12.765
<i>McCLAREN: It isn't.</i>

29:12.767 --> 29:18.870
<i>RACHEL: Okay, so you tell me then...
what happened?</i>

29:20.106 --> 29:21.807
<i>McCLAREN: Do you
mind if I smoke?</i>

29:21.809 --> 29:24.843
<i>NAOMI: No, go ahead.</i>

29:26.545 --> 29:31.050
<i>If I do this, what'll happen at
Princefield after the news breaks?</i>

29:31.052 --> 29:34.019
<i>McCLAREN: Well, the SEC will
most likely investigate.</i>

29:34.021 --> 29:37.089
<i>And your colleagues will
naturally want to know the</i>

29:37.091 --> 29:39.692
<i>source of the leak, but
they'll never find out.</i>

29:39.694 --> 29:42.861
<i>NAOMI: And this whole process--
you oversee it yourself?</i>

29:42.863 --> 29:47.166
<i>McCLAREN: I do.</i>

29:47.168 --> 29:51.837
<i>Naomi, none of our sources
has ever been exposed.</i>

29:51.839 --> 29:56.108
<i>We've done this many times.</i>

29:56.110 --> 29:59.512
<i>Everything's going to be okay.</i>

30:06.021 --> 30:08.522
<i>NAOMI: All right.</i>

30:08.524 --> 30:11.759
<i>You'll get the files.</i>

30:15.331 --> 30:21.269
<i>McCLAREN: I appreciate
what you're doing.</i>

30:21.271 --> 30:22.437
<i>I know it isn't easy.</i>

30:22.439 --> 30:25.507
<i>NAOMI: No, I want to do it.</i>

30:25.509 --> 30:28.043
<i>Thank you for your help.</i>

30:39.222 --> 30:42.124
<i>I want to.</i>

30:42.126 --> 30:44.493
<i>But I shouldn't.</i>

30:44.495 --> 30:48.297
<i>Sleeping with you in
Rome was a mistake.</i>

31:01.978 --> 31:03.946
<i>Channing, really.</i>

31:03.948 --> 31:06.315
<i>(Naomi sighs)</i>

31:06.317 --> 31:07.850
<i>McCLAREN: Come on.</i>

31:07.852 --> 31:11.554
<i>NAOMI: No, I-- really...
I can't.</i>

31:11.556 --> 31:12.555
<i>No.</i>

31:12.557 --> 31:13.523
<i>Stop.</i>

31:13.525 --> 31:15.358
<i>McCLAREN: - It's okay.
NAOMI: - Stop.</i>

31:15.360 --> 31:19.228
<i>McCLAREN: Come on, it'll
be okay, I promise.</i>

31:19.230 --> 31:21.430
<i>NAOMI: Get off of me.</i>

31:21.432 --> 31:22.397
<i>Get off.</i>

31:22.399 --> 31:23.431
<i>Get off.</i>

31:23.433 --> 31:25.267
<i>McCLAREN: It'll be okay.</i>

31:25.269 --> 31:26.601
<i>NAOMI: Get off!</i>

31:26.603 --> 31:29.136
<i>Get off me.</i>

31:29.138 --> 31:30.404
<i>(McClaren groans)</i>

31:30.406 --> 31:31.872
<i>McCLAREN: Fuck, fuck.</i>

31:31.874 --> 31:33.774
<i>NAOMI: What the fuck
is wrong with you?!</i>

31:33.776 --> 31:35.910
<i>McCLAREN: I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean...
Sometimes I just...</i>

31:35.912 --> 31:37.411
<i>NAOMI: You're lucky I
don't call the police.</i>

31:37.413 --> 31:38.179
<i>McCLAREN: No, n-no, don't.</i>

31:38.181 --> 31:39.146
<i>You don't want to do that.</i>

31:39.148 --> 31:41.315
<i>Th-That would, that
would be a, a mistake.</i>

31:41.317 --> 31:43.150
<i>NAOMI: What's that
supposed to mean?</i>

31:43.152 --> 31:47.788
<i>McCLAREN: Just p-please
don't talk about this.</i>

31:47.790 --> 31:50.792
<i>It was a misunderstanding.</i>

31:52.194 --> 31:58.900
<i>I was... aggressive with her.</i>

31:58.902 --> 32:03.036
<i>- But I thought...
RACHEL: - You thought what?</i>

32:05.607 --> 32:10.211
<i>McCLAREN: I've never
been good with people.</i>

32:10.213 --> 32:17.885
<i>When I was your age my only friend
was my PC and I liked it that way.</i>

32:17.887 --> 32:18.887
<i>(sighs)</i>

32:18.889 --> 32:25.060
<i>See, I-I misjudge people, I-I don't...
know how to read the signs.</i>

32:25.062 --> 32:27.997
<i>RACHEL: My mother said
you threatened her.</i>

32:27.999 --> 32:30.200
<i>McCLAREN: I didn't do that.</i>

32:30.202 --> 32:32.469
<i>RACHEL: Why would she lie to me?</i>

32:32.471 --> 32:36.807
<i>McCLAREN: I'm, I'm not
saying that she lied.</i>

32:36.809 --> 32:40.510
<i>If she told you that, she
must have felt threatened.</i>

32:40.512 --> 32:44.214
<i>She must have
misinterpreted me.</i>

32:44.216 --> 32:48.752
<i>But I swear to you
there was no threat.</i>

32:48.754 --> 32:52.789
<i>RACHEL: What about the personal
files you stole from her?</i>

32:52.791 --> 32:55.992
<i>McCLAREN: I would never steal
from a potential leaker.</i>

32:55.994 --> 33:01.062
<i>If I conducted myself that way,
I would lose credibility.</i>

33:01.064 --> 33:03.264
<i>You don't know me, so I don't</i>

33:03.266 --> 33:05.300
<i>expect you to believe
me, but it</i>

33:05.302 --> 33:08.736
<i>was never my intention to hurt
your mother, and that's what</i>

33:08.738 --> 33:12.706
<i>this case is all about.</i>

33:12.708 --> 33:15.275
<i>RACHEL: Are you through?</i>

33:17.078 --> 33:22.483
<i>McCLAREN: I didn't come here to
tell you I'm a good person.</i>

33:22.485 --> 33:25.519
<i>I'm not asking you
to forgive me.</i>

33:25.521 --> 33:29.090
<i>But if we leave it up to our
lawyers, this case will go on</i>

33:29.092 --> 33:32.060
<i>for a long, long time and our</i>

33:32.062 --> 33:36.097
<i>lives will still never return
to what they once were.</i>

33:39.568 --> 33:43.871
<i>RACHEL: So what do
you want from me?</i>

33:43.873 --> 33:49.277
<i>McCLAREN: I can't undo
the damage I've caused.</i>

33:49.279 --> 33:53.147
<i>But maybe I can stop it
from getting worse.</i>

33:53.149 --> 33:54.215
<i>RACHEL: How?</i>

33:54.217 --> 33:57.585
<i>FRANKLIN: I need to
tell you something.</i>

33:57.587 --> 33:58.619
<i>PARSONS: What?</i>

33:58.621 --> 34:01.422
<i>FRANKLIN: The old case between Patty
and me-- the one we talked about.</i>

34:01.424 --> 34:02.423
<i>PARSONS: Yeah?</i>

34:02.425 --> 34:06.827
<i>FRANKLIN: Something has come up and it
requires me to have contact with Patty.</i>

34:06.829 --> 34:08.428
<i>Uh, I know.</i>

34:08.429 --> 34:09.896
<i>I'm, I'm sorry.</i>

34:09.898 --> 34:12.032
<i>I should have told you before.</i>

34:12.034 --> 34:13.467
<i>At first I, I didn't want to</i>

34:13.469 --> 34:16.703
<i>bother you with it, but, well,
I realize that was wrong.</i>

34:16.705 --> 34:18.972
<i>Are you okay with
me pursuing it?</i>

34:18.974 --> 34:21.274
<i>PARSONS: As long as it
doesn't interfere with...</i>

34:21.275 --> 34:23.943
<i>FRANKLIN: No, absolutely not.</i>

34:23.945 --> 34:29.081
<i>I will only do it on my
time and of course...</i>

34:32.786 --> 34:36.221
<i>(dog barking)</i>

34:36.223 --> 34:40.292
<i>(Parsons screaming)</i>

34:45.031 --> 34:47.099
<i>FRANKLIN: Um...</i>

34:49.402 --> 34:51.637
<i>What happened?</i>

34:52.938 --> 34:54.940
<i>PARSONS: What?</i>

34:54.942 --> 34:56.775
<i>FRANKLIN: Are you okay?</i>

34:56.777 --> 34:57.810
<i>PARSONS: Yeah.</i>

34:57.812 --> 34:58.678
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

34:58.680 --> 35:02.916
<i>FRANKLIN: I think we need
to get you some lunch.</i>

35:02.918 --> 35:05.752
<i>PARSONS: Yeah, let's do that.</i>

35:11.192 --> 35:16.697
<i>When I saw you with Chris, I was
glad to hear you were doing well.</i>

35:16.699 --> 35:20.367
<i>PARSONS: Thanks.</i>

35:20.369 --> 35:27.009
<i>Yeah, the thing is, I've, uh,
I've just been kind of...</i>

35:29.446 --> 35:32.214
<i>Kind of what?</i>

35:32.216 --> 35:36.085
<i>PARSONS: Tired, for one thing.</i>

35:36.087 --> 35:37.954
<i>I, I can't sleep at night and I</i>

35:37.956 --> 35:40.623
<i>keep nodding off at my desk.</i>

35:40.625 --> 35:45.027
<i>Well, in the news I've seen
the case that you're trying.</i>

35:45.029 --> 35:47.730
<i>I imagine you're
working very hard.</i>

35:47.732 --> 35:51.034
<i>PARSONS: Yeah, but I'm
used to long hours.</i>

35:51.036 --> 35:55.939
<i>Well, falling asleep during the
day can be a sign of avoidance.</i>

35:55.941 --> 36:00.310
<i>Is anything else going on?</i>

36:00.312 --> 36:02.212
<i>PARSONS: There's something I,</i>

36:02.214 --> 36:04.213
<i>uh, I never talked to you about.</i>

36:04.215 --> 36:06.082
<i>What's that?</i>

36:06.084 --> 36:14.756
<i>PARSONS: The night David was killed...
I was attacked, too.</i>

36:14.758 --> 36:16.758
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

36:16.760 --> 36:18.226
<i>Who attacked you?</i>

36:18.228 --> 36:21.062
<i>PARSONS: Um, a man I had
never seen before.</i>

36:21.064 --> 36:24.666
<i>D-Did the police
ever apprehend him?</i>

36:24.668 --> 36:28.269
<i>PARSONS: No.</i>

36:28.271 --> 36:35.043
<i>And I thought I saw him this
afternoon on the street.</i>

36:35.045 --> 36:38.980
<i>But th-the thing is, um, I
could have been imagining it.</i>

36:38.982 --> 36:41.216
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

36:41.218 --> 36:45.620
<i>PARSONS: 'Cause I've been,
um, seeing things lately.</i>

36:45.622 --> 36:50.658
<i>I've been having dreams, uh...</i>

36:50.660 --> 36:54.562
<i>visions I guess you
would call them.</i>

36:54.564 --> 36:57.031
<i>Visions?</i>

36:57.033 --> 37:02.504
<i>PARSONS: Yeah, reliving things.</i>

37:02.506 --> 37:09.678
<i>Why didn't you speak about the
attack back when you were in group?</i>

37:09.680 --> 37:13.382
<i>PARSONS: David's death seemed
more important at the time.</i>

37:13.384 --> 37:17.319
<i>Right.</i>

37:17.321 --> 37:20.055
<i>Imagining things, uh, reliving</i>

37:20.057 --> 37:25.795
<i>trauma-- that's all expected if you
haven't dealt with the event.</i>

37:25.797 --> 37:30.099
<i>You add to that the stress from
your work, it's hardly a</i>

37:30.101 --> 37:33.503
<i>surprise that you're
not sleeping.</i>

37:33.505 --> 37:42.446
<i>Maybe... this isn't the best
time to be trying this case.</i>

37:44.015 --> 37:46.983
<i>Maybe you should drop it.</i>

37:55.227 --> 37:57.661
<i>PARSONS: I can't.</i>

37:59.998 --> 38:03.801
<i>HEWES: I told you not
to meet with him.</i>

38:03.803 --> 38:05.269
<i>RACHEL: I know.</i>

38:05.271 --> 38:07.638
<i>But I wanted to hear
what he had to say.</i>

38:07.640 --> 38:10.774
<i>HEWES: And he said
he was innocent.</i>

38:10.776 --> 38:13.543
<i>What a surprise.</i>

38:16.247 --> 38:22.319
<i>RACHEL: He also offered me $3
million to settle the case.</i>

38:25.457 --> 38:27.992
<i>HEWES: And did you accept it?</i>

38:27.994 --> 38:29.093
<i>RACHEL: No.</i>

38:29.095 --> 38:30.128
<i>HEWES: Good.</i>

38:30.130 --> 38:38.470
<i>RACHEL: But I've had some time to think
about it and I've decided I'm going to.</i>

38:38.472 --> 38:41.707
<i>HEWES: So you believe his story.</i>

38:41.709 --> 38:45.644
<i>RACHEL: I don't know
what to believe.</i>

38:45.646 --> 38:48.680
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

38:48.682 --> 38:54.018
<i>He and I both want
the same thing.</i>

38:54.020 --> 38:58.289
<i>HEWES: And what is that?</i>

38:58.291 --> 39:01.392
<i>RACHEL: For this to be over.</i>

39:01.394 --> 39:09.967
<i>HEWES: Rachel, do you really think your
mother's life is worth only $3 million?</i>

39:09.969 --> 39:15.839
<i>And who is going to stop McClaren from
ever doing this again to someone else?</i>

39:15.841 --> 39:21.778
<i>RACHEL: I've made up
my mind, Ms. Hewes.</i>

39:21.780 --> 39:25.849
<i>I want the case settled.</i>

39:25.851 --> 39:29.986
<i>Please draw up whatever
paperwork is necessary.</i>

39:44.301 --> 39:47.337
<i>Wonderful to see you
again, Mr. Schultz.</i>

39:47.339 --> 39:48.638

39:48.640 --> 39:49.606
<i>Two nights this time.</i>

<i>FRANKLIN: Parsons
and Associates.</i>

40:13.167 --> 40:14.433
<i>Ms. Franklin?</i>

40:14.435 --> 40:17.370
<i>This is Steve Matiello
from the Montclair Hotel.</i>

40:17.372 --> 40:18.371
<i>FRANKLIN: Yes?</i>

40:18.373 --> 40:21.373
<i>MATIELLO: The man you asked
about, he came back.</i>

40:21.375 --> 40:24.110
<i>He'll be with us for the
next couple of nights.</i>

40:24.112 --> 40:25.811
<i>FRANKLIN: Thank you
for the information.</i>

40:25.813 --> 40:27.546
<i>MATIELLO: You're very
welcome, Ms. Franklin.</i>

40:27.548 --> 40:31.583
<i>FRANKLIN: You'll
be taken care of.</i>

40:31.585 --> 40:33.185
<i>PARSONS: Who was that?</i>

40:33.187 --> 40:35.320
<i>FRANKLIN: We have a new witness.</i>

40:35.322 --> 40:38.457
<i>And now we just have to
convince him to talk to us.</i>

40:38.459 --> 40:39.592
<i>PARSONS: The information that</i>

40:39.594 --> 40:41.427
<i>you've provided here today will</i>

40:41.429 --> 40:44.464
<i>be extremely helpful, Mr. Weld.</i>

40:44.466 --> 40:45.999
<i>The fact that you didn't see or</i>

40:46.001 --> 40:49.268
<i>hear anything at the hotel will go
a long way to bolster our case.</i>

40:49.270 --> 40:50.970
<i>WELD: Glad I could be of help.</i>

40:50.972 --> 40:53.072
<i>ATTORNEY: Are we through
here, Ms. Parsons?</i>

40:53.074 --> 40:56.275
<i>PARSONS: Actually, there's one
last this I wanted to ask you.</i>

40:56.277 --> 40:58.011
<i>WELD: What's that?</i>

40:58.013 --> 41:01.480
<i>PARSONS: Your reason for
being in the hotel.</i>

41:01.482 --> 41:05.017
<i>ATTORNEY: If possible, we'd
rather not get into that.</i>

41:05.019 --> 41:09.155
<i>PARSONS: I understand this
may be a delicate matter,</i>

41:09.157 --> 41:11.592
<i>but as I've said,
I'm on your side.</i>

41:11.594 --> 41:13.627
<i>You're critical to my case.</i>

41:13.629 --> 41:18.466
<i>WELD: Look, if you're worried I was
breaking the law or something, I wasn't.</i>

41:18.468 --> 41:20.000
<i>PARSONS: Certainly.</i>

41:20.002 --> 41:22.903
<i>But given the opportunity,
opposing counsel will cast you</i>

41:22.905 --> 41:25.873
<i>in as negative a light
as she possibly can.</i>

41:25.875 --> 41:32.046
<i>I need the facts, to prevent
that from happening.</i>

41:32.048 --> 41:34.949
<i>I assure you, I'm not asking
for any other reason than to</i>

41:34.951 --> 41:38.152
<i>protect your privacy
and credibility.</i>

41:44.493 --> 41:50.131
<i>WELD: I have a friend in the city
who I see from time to time.</i>

41:50.133 --> 41:54.235
<i>We sit in the room and
have drink or two.</i>

41:54.237 --> 41:58.506
<i>And she spends the night.</i>

41:58.508 --> 42:01.809
<i>PARSONS: Thank you for
your candor, Mr. Weld.</i>

42:01.811 --> 42:04.212
<i>I have no more questions.</i>

42:04.214 --> 42:06.447
<i>FRANKLIN: Miss Parsons,
may I speak with you?</i>

42:06.449 --> 42:09.617
<i>PARSONS: I'll just be a moment.</i>

42:12.988 --> 42:16.224
<i>FRANKLIN: Hewes & Associates
just messengered this over.</i>

42:22.364 --> 42:23.597
<i>PARSONS: Shit.</i>

42:23.599 --> 42:26.700
<i>FRANKLIN: What's happened?</i>

42:26.702 --> 42:29.603
<i>PARSONS: The case
is being dropped.</i>

42:29.605 --> 42:32.273
<i>FRANKLIN: How?</i>

42:32.275 --> 42:36.010
<i>PARSONS: McClaren went behind my back and
offered Rachel Walling a settlement.</i>

42:36.012 --> 42:37.779
<i>FRANKLIN: And she accepted?</i>

42:37.781 --> 42:39.780
<i>PARSONS: Yeah.</i>

42:39.782 --> 42:45.252
<i>There's a meeting with Judge Gearheart
in 48 hours to sign off on the terms.</i>

42:45.254 --> 42:47.188
<i>Shit.</i>

42:47.190 --> 42:48.556
<i>SIMON: Relax, Miss Parsons.</i>

42:48.558 --> 42:49.824
<i>It's over; you won.</i>

42:49.826 --> 42:51.392
<i>Come on, sit down, join us.</i>

42:51.394 --> 42:52.493
<i>NOVAK: Congratulations.</i>

42:52.495 --> 42:53.494
<i>PARSONS: This is not a win.</i>

42:53.496 --> 42:56.064
<i>Not for me, and
certainly not for you.</i>

42:56.066 --> 42:57.098
<i>McCLAREN: It's behind me now.</i>

42:57.100 --> 42:58.599
<i>And that's all I care about.</i>

42:58.601 --> 43:01.703
<i>PARSONS: You honestly think
settling with Rachel Walling</i>

43:01.705 --> 43:03.739
<i>is going to restore
your reputation?</i>

43:03.741 --> 43:07.210
<i>SIMON: Well, not at first, maybe,
but slowly the leaks will</i>

43:07.212 --> 43:08.311
<i>start coming in again.</i>

43:08.313 --> 43:10.146
<i>McCLAREN: And then we're
back in business.</i>

43:10.148 --> 43:11.949
<i>PARSONS: Look, I
have a new witness.</i>

43:11.951 --> 43:12.983
<i>The hotel guest
that was staying</i>

43:12.985 --> 43:14.818
<i>in the room next to
Channing and Naomi.</i>

43:14.820 --> 43:15.653
<i>McCLAREN: You found him?</i>

43:15.655 --> 43:17.755
<i>PARSONS: Yes, and he
backs up your story.</i>

43:17.757 --> 43:19.056
<i>He said he heard no sounds of a</i>

43:19.058 --> 43:20.458
<i>struggle coming from your room.</i>

43:20.460 --> 43:22.527
<i>NOVAK: That's just one witness.</i>

43:22.529 --> 43:24.395
<i>It's not a guarantee
you'll win at trial.</i>

43:24.397 --> 43:28.233
<i>PARSONS: No, but Patty's case is bad,
and this witness will make it worse.</i>

43:28.235 --> 43:31.236
<i>SIMON: Look, I have no
doubt that you could win.</i>

43:31.238 --> 43:32.704
<i>But to start attracting leaks</i>

43:32.706 --> 43:34.005
<i>again, we have to stay relevant.</i>

43:34.007 --> 43:36.374
<i>McCLAREN: Which won't happen
with a lawsuit going on.</i>

43:36.376 --> 43:42.214
<i>PARSONS: Well, I've given
you my legal opinion.</i>

43:42.216 --> 43:43.348
<i>But you're the client.</i>

43:43.350 --> 43:45.550
<i>NOVAK: Yes, he is.</i>

43:45.552 --> 43:47.118
<i>And it's over.</i>

43:47.120 --> 43:52.924
<i>PARSONS: Just as soon as Judge Gearheart
signs off on the settlement.</i>

43:52.926 --> 43:55.026
<i>Congratulations.</i>

43:58.731 --> 44:00.898
<i>SANCHEZ: Three million doesn't
seem like a lot for such</i>

44:00.900 --> 44:02.666
<i>a high-profile case.</i>

44:02.668 --> 44:04.101
<i>PARSONS: It isn't.</i>

44:04.103 --> 44:06.236
<i>SANCHEZ: So that's
good for you, then.</i>

44:06.238 --> 44:10.240
<i>PARSONS: This settlement
does nothing for me.</i>

44:10.242 --> 44:12.309
<i>I need to beat Patty in court.</i>

44:12.311 --> 44:13.843
<i>I need to win.</i>

44:13.845 --> 44:15.044
<i>SANCHEZ: Why?</i>

44:15.046 --> 44:18.948
<i>PARSONS: To make a
name for myself.</i>

44:18.950 --> 44:22.785
<i>To launch this firm.</i>

44:22.787 --> 44:25.555
<i>Break out and do things my way.</i>

44:25.557 --> 44:26.856
<i>SANCHEZ: I don't know.</i>

44:26.858 --> 44:28.058
<i>Maybe if settle you might...</i>

44:28.060 --> 44:30.561
<i>you might start sleeping better.</i>

44:30.563 --> 44:32.863
<i>(laughs)</i>

44:32.865 --> 44:34.264
<i>PARSONS: What do you mean?</i>

44:34.266 --> 44:36.533
<i>SANCHEZ: You think I
haven't noticed?</i>

44:36.535 --> 44:42.172
<i>Just when I started sleeping better,
now you're up and down all night.</i>

44:42.174 --> 44:44.274
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

44:50.215 --> 44:51.415
<i>PARSONS: Ellen Parsons.</i>

44:51.417 --> 44:55.620
<i>HEWES: Ellen, this new
witness you've submitted,</i>

44:55.622 --> 44:59.156
<i>Thomas Weld, I want
to depose him.</i>

44:59.158 --> 45:00.157
<i>PARSONS: What's the point?</i>

45:00.159 --> 45:02.126
<i>Your client accepted
a settlement.</i>

45:02.128 --> 45:04.194
<i>HEWES: Until the judge has
officially signed off, there is</i>

45:04.196 --> 45:06.696
<i>still a case, and I have the
right to depose your witness.</i>

45:06.698 --> 45:08.765
<i>PARSONS: You're
wasting your time.</i>

45:08.767 --> 45:11.000
<i>Thomas Weld can't help your
case, and you know it.</i>

45:11.002 --> 45:13.235
<i>You already questioned him.</i>

45:13.237 --> 45:17.105
<i>HEWES: Maybe I asked him
the wrong questions.</i>

45:19.675 --> 45:21.042
<i>You say you saw the long-haired</i>

45:21.044 --> 45:22.911
<i>man enter Naomi Walling's room?</i>

45:22.913 --> 45:24.313
<i>WELD: Yes.</i>

45:24.315 --> 45:28.350
<i>HEWES: After he went in, did you overhear
any sounds coming from her room?</i>

45:28.352 --> 45:30.352
<i>WELD: We had this
conversation already.</i>

45:30.354 --> 45:32.487
<i>HEWES: Well, now
you're under oath.</i>

45:32.489 --> 45:35.289
<i>Did you hear anything
in the room next door?</i>

45:35.291 --> 45:37.024
<i>WELD: No. Nothing.</i>

45:37.026 --> 45:40.794
<i>HEWES: No raised voices, sounds of
a struggle, nothing like that?</i>

45:40.796 --> 45:41.895
<i>WELD: Nope.</i>

45:41.897 --> 45:42.863
<i>Place was quiet as a church.</i>

45:42.865 --> 45:45.432
<i>HEWES: Then I have to ask you,
Mr. Weld, why was it, that</i>

45:45.434 --> 45:49.703
<i>at 10:32, you placed a call to
the front desk complaining</i>

45:49.705 --> 45:53.573
<i>about a loud argument
in the room next door?</i>

45:53.575 --> 45:56.410
<i>WELD: I didn't.</i>

45:56.412 --> 45:59.913
<i>HEWES: This is a written
statement from an employee of</i>

45:59.915 --> 46:01.215
<i>the Montclair Hotel.</i>

46:01.217 --> 46:04.952
<i>It states that you called to
complain about the noise and</i>

46:04.954 --> 46:08.189
<i>demanded that someone be
sent to deal with it.</i>

46:08.191 --> 46:13.661
<i>Does that refresh your
memory, Mr. Weld?</i>

46:13.663 --> 46:15.529
<i>WELD: I warned you both.</i>

46:15.531 --> 46:17.832
<i>I didn't want to get
involved in this.</i>

46:17.834 --> 46:19.333
<i>Always in the wrong fucking</i>

46:19.335 --> 46:21.102
<i>place at the wrong fucking time.</i>

46:21.104 --> 46:23.571
<i>HEWES: Being in the wrong place
at the wrong time doesn't</i>

46:23.573 --> 46:25.673
<i>excuse you from
telling the truth.</i>

46:25.675 --> 46:27.675
<i>WELD: All right, you
want to hear the truth?</i>

46:27.677 --> 46:28.676
<i>I'll tell you the truth.</i>

46:28.678 --> 46:30.745
<i>PARSONS: Mr. Weld, I think you
should just think about what...</i>

46:30.747 --> 46:31.679
<i>WELD: No.</i>

46:31.681 --> 46:32.847
<i>I'm sick of this shit.</i>

46:32.849 --> 46:35.316
<i>I got my own life and my
own goddamn problems.</i>

46:35.318 --> 46:38.686
<i>HEWES: Did you hear sounds of distress
coming from the adjacent room?</i>

46:38.688 --> 46:41.356
<i>WELD: I heard a lot
of goddamn distress.</i>

46:41.358 --> 46:45.693
<i>God knows what that guy was doing
to her, but the lady was terrified.</i>

46:45.695 --> 46:47.061
<i>HEWES: How do you know that?</i>

46:47.063 --> 46:49.063
<i>WELD: She was shrieking,
screaming.</i>

46:49.065 --> 46:53.335
<i>It sounded like furniture
was being knocked over.</i>

46:53.337 --> 46:55.637
<i>And then, he started cursing</i>

46:55.639 --> 46:59.975
<i>her, calling her a bitch,
cunt, that kind of thing.</i>

46:59.977 --> 47:04.046
<i>She kept begging for him to
stop, but he wouldn't stop.</i>

47:04.048 --> 47:05.046
<i>HEWES: And then what?</i>

47:05.048 --> 47:06.214
<i>WELD: He threatened her.</i>

47:06.216 --> 47:11.085
<i>He-he yelled something
about, uh, getting even.</i>

47:11.087 --> 47:14.889
<i>And then I heard a door
slam, and he was gone.</i>

47:14.891 --> 47:20.227
<i>And then I heard her sobbing,
and then... silence.</i>

47:23.030 --> 47:25.665
<i>And that was the last
I heard of her.</i>

47:25.667 --> 47:26.632
<i>(sniffles)</i>

47:26.634 --> 47:30.503
<i>RACHEL: And this man was in
the room right next door?</i>

47:30.505 --> 47:34.573
<i>HEWES: Yes.</i>

47:36.075 --> 47:39.177
<i>I'm sorry, Rachel.</i>

47:39.179 --> 47:46.552
<i>But you need to know the kind
of man McClaren really is.</i>

47:51.023 --> 47:53.591
<i>PARSONS: You gave a
good performance.</i>

47:53.593 --> 47:56.328
<i>WELD: Didn't have
much of a choice.</i>

47:56.330 --> 47:57.896
<i>PARSONS: Sorry.</i>

47:57.898 --> 48:02.734
<i>I don't like to use threats, but
worked out for both of us.</i>

48:02.736 --> 48:04.369
<i>I got what I wanted,
and you get</i>

48:04.371 --> 48:05.737
<i>to keep seeing your lady friend</i>

48:05.739 --> 48:06.938
<i>without your wife finding out.</i>

48:06.940 --> 48:09.641
<i>WELD: Why did you
force me to lie?</i>

48:09.643 --> 48:14.712
<i>PARSONS: Have a nice
day, Mr. Weld.</i>

48:20.486 --> 48:24.522
<i>HEWES: Ellen, come in.</i>

48:27.726 --> 48:32.029
<i>Would you like a drink?</i>

48:32.031 --> 48:35.300
<i>PARSONS: Uh, no, thank
you, I'm good.</i>

48:35.302 --> 48:39.037
<i>HEWES: Well, that was enjoyable.</i>

48:39.039 --> 48:41.940
<i>Mr. Weld put on quite an act.</i>

48:41.942 --> 48:45.143
<i>PARSONS: Did you show
Rachel the videotape?</i>

48:45.145 --> 48:46.744
<i>HEWES: Yes.</i>

48:46.746 --> 48:47.845
<i>PARSONS: And?</i>

48:47.847 --> 48:53.550
<i>HEWES: And she doesn't
want to settle anymore.</i>

48:53.552 --> 48:56.820
<i>So, you see, everything
worked out.</i>

48:56.822 --> 49:01.625
<i>PARSONS: Weld's still in my
control, so if you try to use</i>

49:01.627 --> 49:04.662
<i>his testimony at trial,
I'll have him recant.</i>

49:04.664 --> 49:10.202
<i>HEWES: I promised you I would not
use his testimony and I won't.</i>

49:10.204 --> 49:12.838
<i>You see what we can do
when we work together?</i>

49:12.840 --> 49:15.842
<i>PARSONS: We're not
working together.</i>

49:15.844 --> 49:19.012
<i>Just for once, we happen
to want the same thing.</i>

49:19.014 --> 49:24.183
<i>HEWES: To try this
case in court.</i>

49:24.185 --> 49:26.419
<i>Why are you standing in
the doorway like that?</i>

49:26.421 --> 49:28.488
<i>Come on in.</i>

49:28.490 --> 49:31.391
<i>PARSONS: Oh, I, I got to go.</i>

49:31.393 --> 49:35.061
<i>HEWES: You're not
afraid of me, are you?</i>

49:37.698 --> 49:40.600
<i>(Hewes chuckles)</i>

49:40.602 --> 49:44.604
<i>Well, you looked like
you were afraid.</i>

49:44.606 --> 49:46.072
<i>PARSONS: Good night.</i>

49:46.074 --> 49:51.778
<i>HEWES: You know, I remember when
you first were working for me.</i>

49:51.780 --> 49:59.886
<i>You stood right in that doorway and you
invited me to your engagement party.</i>

49:59.888 --> 50:02.255
<i>HEWES: Do you remember that?</i>

50:04.558 --> 50:07.827
<i>You were such a sweet girl.</i>

50:09.196 --> 50:12.632
<i>PARSONS: You should really
watch your drinking, Patty.</i>

50:12.634 --> 50:17.403
<i>HEWES: And now you're
looking out for me.</i>

50:17.405 --> 50:19.972
<i>I'm touched.</i>

50:30.417 --> 50:33.619
<i>All rise.</i>

<i>The Supreme Court of the State</i>
