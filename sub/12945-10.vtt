11:09.367 --> 11:11.066
What am I supposed to believe?

11:11.133 --> 11:14.600
Well, you're supposed to believe me
and you don't.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.033
Thanks for being such a lousy friend.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.033
Gordo, shouldn't you be stretching?

11:27.233 --> 11:30.100
Oh, um... [KNUCKLES CRACKING] There.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.467
How can you be so casual
about this, Gordo?

11:32.533 --> 11:34.567
You're getting ready
to go up and do a routine.

11:34.633 --> 11:35.967
Aren't you afraid you'll flunk?

11:36.433 --> 11:37.934
I'm sure it'll be fine.

11:38.533 --> 11:40.433
I wish I could say
the same thing about Miranda.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.066
I mean, she hasn't even spoken to me.

11:42.133 --> 11:44.934
Well, Miranda can be
a bit unreasonable at times.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.934
-How can you say that, Gordo?
-[BUZZER SOUNDS]

11:47.000 --> 11:48.533
I practically accused her of stealing.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.066
Well, yeah.
You did kind of hang her out to dry.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.133
-How can you say that, Gordo?
-[BUZZER SOUNDS]

11:53.200 --> 11:55.567
Just because I doubted her
for one single second?

11:55.633 --> 11:57.600
I mean, the lipstick was in her purse.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.300
You're right. The evidence was there.

11:59.367 --> 12:00.967
-How can you say that, Gordo?
-[BUZZER SOUNDS]

12:01.033 --> 12:02.900
Miranda is my best friend
and I should know

12:02.967 --> 12:04.000
that she doesn't steal.

12:04.066 --> 12:07.967
[STAMMERS] Whose side do you want me
to be on here? Yours or yours?

12:08.033 --> 12:09.533
[SIGHING] I'm sorry.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.300
I know that I let Miranda down
and I didn't mean to.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.233
And now she's calling me a bad friend.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.834
You know, she's letting me down.

12:16.900 --> 12:20.333
Give it time. It'll blow over.
I'm sure everything's gonna be cool.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.533
-Mr. Dig?
-[SIGHS]

12:22.600 --> 12:24.567
I'd like another partner, please.

Uh...

12:27.734 --> 12:31.633
[SCOFFING] You know, for a smart guy,
you sure get a lot of stuff wrong.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.200
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

12:33.633 --> 12:34.900
Okay, listen up.

12:35.266 --> 12:38.734
Miss Sanchez feels that she can
no longer work with her partner,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.800
so we're going
to shuffle the deck a little, okay?

12:40.867 --> 12:42.633
Cassie Pang, you're with Miranda,

12:42.700 --> 12:43.834
and Miss McGuire,

12:44.233 --> 12:45.700
you're with Ethan Craft.

12:45.767 --> 12:46.767
Uh...

12:49.800 --> 12:52.000
Miranda wants to play it
this way, fine.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.500
I'll fall into Ethan Craft's arms.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.367
And fall.

Oh, that hurt.

[GROANS]

13:23.333 --> 13:24.500
That was good.

13:28.734 --> 13:31.767
Hey, and welcome to <i>Matt After Dinner.</i>

13:31.834 --> 13:35.100
Now, I know what you're thinking,
Lanny, 'cause you ask me every night.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.433
What did I have for dinner tonight?

13:37.533 --> 13:41.934
I had three sauerkraut chili dogs
and a root beer.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.500
[BELCHING]

13:49.266 --> 13:51.767
I know you think we're going
for the cheap laughs, Lanny,

13:51.834 --> 13:53.600
but look at the green lights.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.433
This stuff sells.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.900
Hey, guys.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.567
Hey, look, it's a surprise guest.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.867
It's Dad. What you got there, Dad?

14:04.934 --> 14:05.934
Well, son,

14:06.600 --> 14:08.533
I have a box full of feathers,

14:08.600 --> 14:10.433
a few dozen whoopie cushions,

14:10.633 --> 14:12.900
and some old maple syrup.

14:13.266 --> 14:15.066
I'm working on a project.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.500

14:17.967 --> 14:20.934
Oh, son, no. Don't take that.

14:21.667 --> 14:22.667
Oh!

14:22.734 --> 14:24.400
Give that back to me, son.

-Let me... No!

15:16.600 --> 15:17.633
Good luck.

15:17.734 --> 15:18.967
Looking back on it,

15:19.033 --> 15:22.200
they might have been smart
just to practice that at least like...

15:22.266 --> 15:23.400
Ooh, once.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.266
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

15:58.367 --> 16:00.100
And we thank you.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.066
Beth's mom made her take ballet
since she was eight.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.367
I knew she'd make me look good.

16:09.433 --> 16:11.633
She's got the footwork,
I've got the flair.

16:12.734 --> 16:14.000
Okay, next.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.100
Miranda's partner,
Cassie Pang, has whooping cough.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.367
And, uh, Ethan Craft, uh,

16:19.433 --> 16:21.500
spotted a cloud he thought
looked like a donkey

16:21.567 --> 16:23.166
and ran face first into a beehive.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.133
He shan't be joining us today.

of Sanchez and McGuire.

partner with a lousy friend.

would have stuck up for me!

always sneak into the movies

you were mad at Lanny.

than I've been to Miranda,

then I've totally hit bottom.

Oh, let's step in here, please.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.400
I read your report on <i>The Red Pony</i>

it was written by a professional.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.400

19:34.567 --> 19:35.967

the <i>E Z Read Condensed Notes</i>
on <i>The Red Pony</i>

19:42.767 --> 19:45.266
and paraphrase
their overview of the novel.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.967
Are you trying to say
I copied my report?

19:48.433 --> 19:51.000
I'm saying you took a big shortcut.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.467
No, she didn't.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.667
Miranda is my best friend,
and she doesn't lie,

19:54.734 --> 19:57.200
and she doesn't cheat,
and I know that she doesn't steal.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.567
And I was wrong
to think that in the first place.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.367
You know, I totally trust Miranda

20:02.433 --> 20:04.433
and if she says
she didn't do something,

20:04.867 --> 20:06.133
then I'm going to believe her.

if I used the <i>E Z Read Notes,</i>

it would just tell me
what the story was about.

what you think about <i>The Red Pony,</i>
