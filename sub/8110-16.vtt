WHILE HE IGNORES HIS JOB
AND LICKS HIS WOUNDS.

DON'T DO THAT.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.549
HE LOVES HER. WHAT?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.950
YOU CAN'T FEEL BAD FOR HIM
FOR FIVE MINUTES?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.653
I CAN FEEL BAD FOR HIM
WHILE STILL EXPECTING HIM

07:32.686 --> 07:34.121
TO ACT LIKE AN ADULT,
SHOW UP FOR WORK,

07:34.154 --> 07:35.523
AND NOT GO ON A BOOZE-,

HANDLE THE CASE WITHOUT HIM.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.695
OH, IS THAT THE REASON?

07:41.729 --> 07:42.996
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T PASS UP

07:43.030 --> 07:44.164
ANY CHANCE TO SEIZE CONTROL.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.899
I SAID "WE."
YOU WANT "PRETTY PLEASE" TOO?

WAIT. I UNDERSTAND THE BOOZE

07:47.801 --> 07:50.771
AND THE HOOKERS,
BUT WHY VICODIN?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.607

ANY FRIENDS IN HERE, DO YOU?

HE'S USED HERE AT WORK?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.082
(Foreman)
YES, THAT IS VERY TROUBLING.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.117
ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE FACT

08:04.151 --> 08:05.686
THAT OUR PATIENT

08:05.719 --> 08:06.720
CRACKED STERNUM,
BROKEN NOSE,

08:06.754 --> 08:07.988
AND PARTIAL HEARING LOSS,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.591
WHICH CAN BE EXPLAINED
BY A BULL JUMPING ON HIM.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.292
AND A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER,
LOW-GRADE FEVER,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.895
NAUSEA, AND PERIPHERAL MUSCLE
WEAKNESS THAT CAN'T.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.697
WHAT IF THE HEARING LOSS
WASN'T CAUSED BY THE BULL?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.065
THAT'S JUST
WHEN HE NOTICED IT?

08:18.098 --> 08:20.834
INNER-EAR PATHOLOGY
CAN AFFECT THE EQUILIBRIUM

08:20.868 --> 08:22.903
AND CAUSE DISORIENTATION,

08:22.936 --> 08:24.572
MAKING IT APPEAR TO BE
A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.073
SO HOW DO WE CONFIRM?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.208

08:29.843 --> 08:31.044
WE CAN DO CALORICS
AND AN ENG.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.212
IF HE HAS INNER-EAR DAMAGE,

08:32.245 --> 08:33.847
IT'LL AFFECT HIS BALANCE.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.783
SOUNDS GOOD. GO AHEAD.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.918
GO AHEAD? REALLY?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.787
WHAT IF ONE OF US
DISAGREES?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.059
I HAPPEN TO AGREE
WITH FOREMAN.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.095
GO DO IT.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.931
YOU KNEW HE WAS AN ADDICT
BEFORE YOU GOT INVOLVED.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.099
DIDN'T END
THE RELATIONSHIP--

08:52.132 --> 08:53.200
YOU KNEW HE WAS AN ASS--

08:53.233 --> 08:55.135
I DIDN'T END IT--

08:55.168 --> 08:57.070
YOU TOLD HIM YOU DID NOT
WANT HIM TO CHANGE.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.138
AND I WAS WRONG.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.773
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.843
YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA DIE.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.211
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WAS THE RIGHT TIME

09:04.244 --> 09:05.946
TO MAKE THIS KIND
OF DECISION?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.047
NO.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.082
BUT I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.352
A LOT.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.855
AND I HAVEN'T
CHANGED MY MIND.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.292
HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA DIE.

09:19.326 --> 09:23.931
NOBODY KNOWS THE RIGHT WAY
TO REACT IN THAT SITUATION.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.599
JUST GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.935
HE DESERVES IT.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.103
I KNOW.

09:30.137 --> 09:36.176
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT HE DESERVES.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.377
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG,

09:37.410 --> 09:40.347
I DON'T WANT TO HOPE
THAT I'M NOT ALONE.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.015
I WANT TO KNOW IT.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.117
WITH HOUSE...

09:45.753 --> 09:48.255
EVERY TIME I NEEDED HIM
TO STEP UP...

09:50.190 --> 09:52.760
HE'S JUST NEVER
GONNA BE THAT.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.161
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
IT'S WHO HE IS.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.630
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT.

09:56.664 --> 09:59.366
THIS IS MY FAULT.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.042
WELL, HE'S BACK ON VICODIN.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.278
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO...

10:11.311 --> 10:14.314
KEEP AN EYE
ON HIS NEW PATIENT.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.153
ENG WAS NORMAL.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.421
MEANS HIS INNER EAR ISN'T--

10:22.455 --> 10:23.423
IT WASN'T--

10:23.456 --> 10:24.858
WHOA.
WAIT A SECOND.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.126
THE ACOUSTICS IN HERE
ARE BEAUTIFUL.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.296
MORONS!

10:29.329 --> 10:31.098
YOU SAY IT.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.766
MORONS.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.034
WHO WAS THAT?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.703
SOMETHING CARNELL GOT ME.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.004
IT WASN'T THAT RIDICULOUS
OF A THEORY.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.005
GREAT THEORY.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.073
IT'S A RIDICULOUS TEST.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.309
YOU CAN'T GIVE
A STANDARD BALANCE TEST

10:42.342 --> 10:44.044
TO A CHAMPION BULL RIDER.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.412
IF YOU'RE GONNA TEST
SUPERMAN'S STRENGTH,

10:45.445 --> 10:47.147
YOU NEED A BIGGER BARBELL.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.949
FIND ONE,
MAKE HIM LIFT IT,

10:48.982 --> 10:51.885
THEN CALL ME AND TELL ME
HOW HIGH IT GOT.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.955
AND TELL CUDDY THAT SPYING
IS FOR COWARDS.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.892
[click]

10:58.926 --> 11:00.193
JUST KEEP ME POSTED.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.895
I WILL.
I WILL.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.100
YOU SAID MY INNER EAR
WAS FINE.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.368
PREVIOUS TEST
WAS FOR REGULAR PEOPLE.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.037
YOU WERE BANGED UP PRETTY BAD
IN THE ACCIDENT.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.972
BUT GIVEN YOUR
ATHLETIC ABILITY...

11:12.005 --> 11:12.806
WASN'T NO ACCIDENT.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.307
THAT BULL HAD MALICE
AND FORETHOUGHT.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.210
UH, YOU MEAN AFORETHOUGHT.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.246
WHATEVER.
HE WAS PISSED.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.914
CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

11:20.948 --> 11:22.049
NOT AT ALL.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.383
IF HE DON'T DO
WHAT HE GETS PAID FOR,

11:23.416 --> 11:24.885
I DON'T GET TO DO
WHAT I GET PAID FOR.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.019
YOU EVER THINK
OF GETTING PAID

11:26.053 --> 11:26.820
FOR DOING SOMETHING ELSE?

11:26.854 --> 11:27.888
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT
OF BONES TO BREAK.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.024
YOU EVER THINK OF DOING
SOMETHING YOU DON'T LOVE?

11:31.058 --> 11:31.992
IT HAS ITS DOWNSIDE,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.894
BUT EVERYTHING DOES.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.430
THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE
THOSE EIGHT SECONDS.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.932
TRAVELING AROUND,
GETTING TO MEET THE FANS,

11:38.966 --> 11:41.802
THAT AIN'T SO BAD EITHER,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.971
ALL RIGHT, NOW WHAT?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.773
(Foreman)
WE'RE GONNA START ROCKING
THE PLATFORM

11:45.806 --> 11:47.107
AND CHANGING
YOUR VISUAL FIELD

11:47.140 --> 11:49.309
WHILE YOU BALANCE
ON JUST YOUR RIGHT LEG.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.144
HERE YOU GO, LANE.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.147
I'M GONNA START SLOW.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.816
(Foreman)
IF YOU START TO EXPERIENCE

11:55.849 --> 11:57.117
ANY NAUSEA
OR DISORIENTATION,

11:57.150 --> 11:58.819
JUST LET US KNOW
AND WE'LL STOP THE TEST.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.120
YOU GOT IT.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.192
[machine whirring]

12:08.862 --> 12:11.098
HA.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.235
THAT IS AMAZING.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.907
WE CAN STOP.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.208
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOTHING WRONG

12:21.241 --> 12:22.876
WITH HIS INNER EAR.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.047
NOW WHAT?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.950
AND I DIRECT THAT QUESTION
NOT TO MY BOSS,

12:29.983 --> 12:31.919
BUT TO ANYONE
WHO HAS AN ANSWER.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.087
IF IT'S NOT IN HIS EAR,
IT'S GOT TO BE HIS BRAIN.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.222
BUT IF WE CAN'T
GET ANY IMAGES,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.324
THEN HOW DO WE--

12:37.357 --> 12:39.059
LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS
GOT SOME RUSTY PIPES.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.428
THIS WATER'S BROWN.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.297
THAT'S NOT FROM THE PIPES.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.034
IT'S FROM YOUR MOUTH.

12:57.044 --> 13:00.047
[telephone rings]

13:01.214 --> 13:03.350
CAN YOU PASS ME THE, UM...

13:08.388 --> 13:09.522
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

13:09.556 --> 13:11.458
(Foreman)
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH HIS EARS,

13:11.491 --> 13:12.592
BUT HE'S GOT BLOOD
IN HIS SPUTUM.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.594
DOESN'T ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.863
WE WEREN'T AVOIDING YOU.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.330
IT TOOK US A LITTLE TIME

13:17.364 --> 13:19.833
TO THINK UP A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
NO ONE'S EVER THOUGHT UP BEFORE.

13:19.867 --> 13:20.733
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.469
IT COULD BE A TUMOR
IN A SALIVARY GLAND.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.104
WE SHOULD GET
A PAROTID BIOPSY.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.505
OH, THAT'S SO CUTE.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.975
YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER
WHO'S IN CHARGE.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.342
(Taub)
GI BLEED'S MORE LIKELY

13:29.376 --> 13:30.477
TO EXPLAIN
THE NAUSEA AND WEAKNESS.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.845
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

13:31.879 --> 13:33.413
HOUSE, AS LONG
AS YOU'RE NOT HERE,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.248
SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE
THE FINAL--
LET ME REPHRASE.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.249
WHO'S YOUR DADDY?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.250
(Taub)
LET ME REPHRASE.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.551
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE

13:38.585 --> 13:39.586
IF YOU'RE GONNA BUCK UP,
GET OUT OF BED,

13:39.619 --> 13:40.988
AND DO YOUR JOB,

13:41.021 --> 13:42.289
OR IF YOU'RE GONNA WALLOW
IN SELF-PITY.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.557
THOSE MY ONLY TWO CHOICES?

13:44.591 --> 13:47.627
OR CAN I ALSO POINT OUT
THE SELF-PITY COMING FROM YOU?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.330
YOU'RE JUST ANNOYED BECAUSE
WHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP ENDED,

13:50.363 --> 13:52.365
NO ONE GAVE A CRAP,
INCLUDING YOU.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.868
THAT IS NOT TRUE
IN SO MANY WAYS.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.503
AND, CHASE,
STOP SCREWING WITH FOREMAN.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.105
AND, FOREMAN, NO.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.107
TILL THE TELEPHONE
GETS UNINVENTED,

14:00.140 --> 14:02.009
NO ONE IN THAT ROOM NEEDS MORE
AUTHORITY THAN I GIVE THEM,

14:02.042 --> 14:03.043
AND RIGHT NOW

14:03.076 --> 14:04.311
I GIVE YOU THE AUTHORITY

14:04.344 --> 14:06.579
TO SCOPE HIS GI TRACT
AND BIOPSY HIS PAROTID.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.581
AND YOU CAN PICK UP
THE PHONE.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.885
WAIT, HOUSE, SHOULD WE
BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

14:11.919 --> 14:13.220
ARE YOU ON VICODIN?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.587
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,

14:14.621 --> 14:17.057
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
BE ORDERING PROCEDURES.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.591
[House laughs]

14:21.394 --> 14:22.896
I AM NOT ON VICODIN.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.432
DO THE TESTS.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.500
I HAVE TO SEE A MAN
ABOUT A HURDY-GURDY.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.137
[giggles]

14:31.638 --> 14:34.174
YOU REALLY THINK HOUSE
ISN'T USING VICODIN?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.643
DOES IT ACTUALLY WORRY YOU?

14:36.676 --> 14:38.111
IF HE'S
SELF-PRESCRIBING MEDS,

14:38.145 --> 14:39.279
THAT COULD AFFECT
HIS JUDGMENT.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.580
AND DOES THAT WORRY YOU?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.449
ARE YOU BEING SARCASTIC?

14:42.482 --> 14:45.152
IF HIS RULE-BREAKING
IS AFFECTING HIS JUDGMENT,

14:45.185 --> 14:46.653
THEN YOU CAN STEP IN
AND YOU CAN WORRY,

14:46.686 --> 14:49.289
BUT IF HE'S JUST
COMING UP WITH IDEAS

14:49.322 --> 14:51.591
THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE,

14:51.624 --> 14:53.693
THEN OUR JOB
IS TO SHUT UP AND DO IT.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.396
AND WHAT DO YOU SEE
IN THIS GUY?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.198
HMM? WHAT? WHO?

15:00.133 --> 15:03.403
OH. YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTED
TO OUR PATIENT?

15:03.436 --> 15:04.704
RIGHT.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.705
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.541
SO YOU WOULDN'T DO IT.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.011
HE'S A MACHO HALF-WIT.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.679
YOU HAVE EVERY REASON
TO NOT BE ATTRACTED TO HIM,

15:12.712 --> 15:14.481
WHICH IS WHY
I ASK THE QUESTION.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.649
WHY ARE YOU ATTRACTED
TO HIM?

15:16.683 --> 15:17.784
STOP IT.
I'M JUST...

15:17.817 --> 15:19.652
NO, NO, NO.
TAKE OUT THE SCOPE.
BUT I DON'T SEE--

15:19.686 --> 15:21.221
NOT THE MONITOR.
LOOK AT HIS EYES.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.328
(Foreman)
SCLERAE TURNED YELLOW.
DID X-RAYS.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.729
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A MASS
IN HIS LIVER,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.498
BUT THE CONDUCTIVE
METAL ROD IN HIS RIBS

15:31.531 --> 15:32.499
IS BLOCKING IT.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.601
MAKING IT, AS THEY SAY,

15:34.634 --> 15:38.105
AS TOUGH TO FIND AS A HOOKER
WHO CAN PLAY THE HURDY-GURDY.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.472
IF YOU HAVE A POINT,
CAN YOU PLEASE--

15:39.506 --> 15:40.607
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.742
MEANS IT'S TOUGH,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.411
BUT APPARENTLY
IT CAN BE DONE.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.545
(Chase)
IF WE DON'T HAVE
ANY EQUIPMENT...

15:45.578 --> 15:46.546
YOU HAVE EYES.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.248
NOT THAT SEE THROUGH STUFF.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.450
OBVIOUSLY.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.518
YOU WANT US
TO CUT HIM OPEN?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.086
ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SEE

15:53.120 --> 15:54.154
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.223
[phone beeps]

15:58.091 --> 15:59.726
DO YOU KNOW FREE BIRD?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.195
[device beeping]

16:07.434 --> 16:08.401
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

16:08.435 --> 16:09.636
NO.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.571
EXACTLY.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.075
MORE SUCTION.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.611
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.481
I DEFINITELY SAW A MASS
ON THE X-RAYS.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.650
IT'S GONE NOW.

16:26.419 --> 16:30.423
IT'S A MASS...

16:30.457 --> 16:32.325
AND THEN IT'S NOT.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.627
YOU, UH,
GONNA INTRODUCE US?

16:36.329 --> 16:39.366
TEAM, MEET DUKE.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.401

16:41.434 --> 16:43.503
ANKE?
HOW'D I GET DUKE?

16:43.536 --> 16:46.506
HOUSE, HOW MANY PROSTITUTES
HAVE YOU HAD?

16:46.539 --> 16:47.640
AS IN EATEN?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.742
EVER? THIS YEAR?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.045
SLEPT WITH.
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.314
ALL BUT ONE.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.316
SHE DID MY TAXES.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.717
ON THE OTHER HAND,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.686
TAPEWORM THAT BURROWED
OUTSIDE HIS INTESTINAL...

16:59.719 --> 17:00.753
(Taub)
WE WOULD HAVE SEEN EGGS

17:00.787 --> 17:01.754
ON A FECAL SMEAR

17:01.788 --> 17:03.623
OR SYSTEMIC EOSINOPHILIA.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.392
DETACHED CYST?

17:05.425 --> 17:06.426
COULDN'T MIGRATE
THAT FAR

17:06.459 --> 17:07.594
IN ONE HOUR.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.528
WE HAVEN'T BEEN
SITTING ON OUR HANDS

17:08.561 --> 17:11.598
JUST WAITING
FOR YOUR BRILLIANCE TO KICK IN.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.700
OKAY,
SO HOW DID YOU SHOOT DOWN

17:13.733 --> 17:15.768
INTERMITTENTLY SWOLLEN
LYMPH NODE?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.774
THAT WOULD MEAN IT'S
SOME KIND OF AN INFECTION,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.676
WHICH WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO DO
A SPINAL TAP.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.478
BUT WITH HIS RECENT
SKULL FRACTURES,

17:25.512 --> 17:27.547
IT COULD BE
AN INCREASED ICP.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.815
HIS BRAIN
COULD HERNIATE.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.450
WHAT ABOUT
A VENTRICULAR PUNCTURE?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.319
SOUNDS GOOD.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.722
YOU THINK STICKING A NEEDLE
DIRECTLY INTO HIS BRAIN

17:35.755 --> 17:38.191
WOULD BE LESS DANGEROUS
THAN STICKING IT IN HIS SPINE?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.659
IT'S PROBABLY A PUSH.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.128
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE,

17:41.161 --> 17:42.529
BECAUSE
UNDERNEATH THIS SHEET,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.232
STUFF IS GOING ON.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.634
JUST PICK A SPOT
AND STICK A NEEDLE IN IT.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.306
YOU WANT TO DRILL
THROUGH MY SKULL

17:53.340 --> 17:55.608
BECAUSE OF A MASS
THAT'S NOT THERE?

17:55.642 --> 17:57.644
IT WAS THERE, WHICH MEANS
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.379
WE NEED TO FIND IT.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.414
IS THERE ANYBODY
YOU'D LIKE US TO CALL?

18:01.448 --> 18:04.251
SOMEONE THAT YOU'D LIKE
TO BE HERE WITH YOU?

18:04.284 --> 18:06.186
MAYBE A WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.887
NO, MY FAMILY'S
ALL BACK IN OKLAHOMA,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.489
AND THE GUYS ON THE CIRCUIT

18:09.522 --> 18:11.691
ARE IN CALGARY
AT THE NEXT RODEO.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.526
AH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.495
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
SOMEBODY NEARBY

18:15.528 --> 18:18.598
YOU CAN TALK TO WHO CARES.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.702
YOU OKAY?

18:22.735 --> 18:23.736
HMM?

18:23.770 --> 18:27.340
YOU JUST SANG, "IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE SOMEBODY NEAR BY

18:27.374 --> 18:29.242
TO TALK TO WHO CARES."

18:29.276 --> 18:31.644
OKAY, FINE. I LIKE HIM.
SO WHAT?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.446
NO KIDDING.
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.248
[quietly]
YEAH.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.283
NEITHER CAN I.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.619
LOOKS CLEAR.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.888
NOTHING IS SUGGESTING
INFLAMMATION.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.623
[Lane groans softly]

18:43.656 --> 18:44.591
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.859
O-2 STATS ARE PLUMMETING.
WE NEED TO INTUBATE.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.561
DROP THE TABLE.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.198
[device beeping rapidly]

18:54.267 --> 18:55.668
I CAN'T GET IT IN.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.904
THE AIRWAY'S BLOCKED.
GET THE TRACH KIT.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.340
[Lane groaning softly]

19:13.886 --> 19:16.856
[beeping returns to normal]

19:16.889 --> 19:18.791
O-2 ARE GOING BACK UP.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.926
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

19:19.959 --> 19:22.729
DID HE DEFECATE?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.234
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.502
I THINK IT'S HIS FEET.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.605
OH.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.242
OH, MAN.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.510
UGH.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.811
IT'S DEFINITELY
HIS FEET.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.516
(Carnell)
PLEASE DON'T.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.355
THAT IS A NICE BOW.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.757
THAT WAS A NICE DOOR.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.958
PUT IT ON MY TAB.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.329
LET'S SAY WE
TAKE IT UP A NOTCH.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.864
YEAH, RIGHT.
VERY FUNNY.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.466
YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

19:59.499 --> 20:00.467
NO.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.302
(woman)
I'LL DO IT.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.938
AND WE HAVE A GAMER.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.807
OH, COME ON, MAN.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.875
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

20:08.908 --> 20:09.942
WHY NOT?

20:09.976 --> 20:12.312
ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
WE JUST TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.681
AND I'M ONLY
EIGHT PACES AWAY.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.948
HOUSE--
I LIKE YOU,
CARNELL.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.285
DON'T RUIN IT.
[telephone rings]

20:18.318 --> 20:21.921

OR GANGRENE--PICK ONE.

20:24.857 --> 20:25.958
(Carnell)
NO!

20:25.992 --> 20:27.427
UH, NONE.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.262
NONE OF THOSE
CAUSE BLOODY SPUTUM

20:29.296 --> 20:30.930
OR DISAPPEARING MASSES.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.565
NO. NO. NO. NO.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.866
YOU'RE GONNA KILL HER.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.802
(House)
DON'T DO THAT, CARNELL.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.405
THEY MIGHT GET THE IDEA
THAT I'M SHOOTING AT A HOOKER.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.713
FUNGAL INFECTION CAN CAUSE
ULCERATION BETWEEN THE TOES

20:46.746 --> 20:49.015
AND BLEEDING COULD BE
FROM RECURRING ABSCESSES

20:49.048 --> 20:51.351
THAT APPEAR TO BE
RECURRING MASSES.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.985
SYMPTOMS IN THE HEAD OR FEET

20:53.019 --> 20:53.753
MEAN THE INFECTION
WOULD HAVE TO BE

20:53.786 --> 20:55.655
IN THE HEART
OR THE BRAIN.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.290
(Taub)
I SAY WE START BY LOOKING
IN THE HEART,

20:57.324 --> 20:58.891
BECAUSE LOOKING
AT HIS BRAIN

20:58.925 --> 21:00.293
WITH A METAL PLATE
IS PROBLEMATIC.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.961
SO'S MRI'ING HIS HEART.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.063
HE'S GOT A SEVEN-CENTIMETER
CONDUCTIVE METAL ROD

21:04.096 --> 21:06.299
HOLDING HIS RIB TOGETHER.
IT'LL RIP HIM IN TWO.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.768
NO, IT'LL JUST FEEL LIKE
IT'S RIPPING HIM IN TWO,

21:08.801 --> 21:10.370
WHICH IS MUCH BETTER.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.771
(Taub)
WE COULD MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE

21:11.804 --> 21:13.973
BY INJECTING ICE WATER
INTO HIS ABDOMINAL CAVITY.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.476
(Carnell)
NO. PLEASE, NO.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.719
OH, GOD!

21:26.753 --> 21:28.020
OOPS.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.391
GOT TO GO.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.459
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

21:32.492 --> 21:33.460
WHY?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.861
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY?

21:34.894 --> 21:35.862
SHE'S HURT!

21:35.895 --> 21:37.797
SHE DOESN'T LOOK HURT.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.103
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.938
YES, WE DID.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.912
[laughs]
YOU'RE AN ASS.

21:52.945 --> 21:56.749
OKAY. GO GET ME, UH,
GENERAL PATTON'S COLT 45.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.485
THE ONE
WITH THE TWO NOTCHES.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.052
HE'S NOT
GETTING YOU A GUN.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.791
YOUR FRIEND KNOWS
HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.063
(Taub)
THE MRI MAGNETS ARE GONNA
HEAT THE METAL.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.399
COULD GET
TO OVER 300 DEGREES

22:12.432 --> 22:13.766
IN 15 SECONDS.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.035
WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE INJECTING ICE WATER

22:16.068 --> 22:18.705
INTO YOUR ABDOMINAL CAVITY.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.807
YOU'LL FEEL COLDER
THAN YOU'VE EVER FELT,

22:20.840 --> 22:23.443
AND THEN YOU'LL BE HOTTER--

22:23.476 --> 22:26.913
UM, YOU'LL FEEL HOTTER
THAN YOU'VE EVER FELT.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.717
[clears throat]

22:30.750 --> 22:31.918
WE'LL TRY TO BE
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.921
WOW.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.789
SHUT UP.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.165
IT'S INTERESTING.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.834
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.869
IT'S MUNDANE AND SIMPLE.

22:49.902 --> 22:53.840
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
A VERY BLESSED SPECIMEN,

22:53.873 --> 22:55.708
SO FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY
POINT OF VIEW,

22:55.742 --> 22:57.577
HE'D PRODUCE
HEALTHY OFFSPRING,

22:57.610 --> 22:59.946
SO MY PREFRONTAL CORTEX
IS TELLING ME

22:59.979 --> 23:01.714
I SHOULD HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.916
OH. IS THAT ALL?
YES.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.453
MY RATIONAL BRAIN KNOWS
HE'S A HILLBILLY AND AN IDIOT.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.455
AND YET SOMEHOW
YOUR RATIONAL BRAIN

23:08.488 --> 23:10.957
IS LOSING THE ARGUMENT,
WHICH IS INTERESTING.

23:13.059 --> 23:13.860
YOU WERE BORED.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.128
YOU MUST HAVE SPENT
ABOUT TWO DAYS

23:16.162 --> 23:19.432
SETTING UP A FAKE MURDER,
AND YOU WERE BORED.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.534
I'M FINE.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.702
YOU'RE NOT.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.973
AND I'M WORRIED YOU MIGHT
DO SOMETHING EVEN STUPIDER.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.975
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE BACK IN
WITH ME?

23:29.008 --> 23:31.010
AT LEAST UNTIL
YOU GET BACK ON TRACK.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.613
WHAT AN EGO.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.915
YOU THINK YOU'RE SOME SORT
OF EMOTIONAL PARAGON?

23:35.948 --> 23:36.916
YOU'RE MY ROCK?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.451
I'M TRYING
TO BE A FRIEND.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.686
AT LEAST I HAVE
THE GOOD SENSE

23:39.719 --> 23:43.055
NOT TO MARRY EVERY WOMAN
I FALL INTO BED WITH.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.857
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MOVE IN
WITH ME.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.926
EITHER WAY.
IF YOU PREFER...

23:46.959 --> 23:48.595
I PREFER YOU TO STOP TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.129
HOUSE, WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
TALKING ABOUT THIS

23:50.162 --> 23:52.732
EXCEPT TO ESTABLISH THE FACT
THAT YOU ARE FINE,

23:52.765 --> 23:53.733
WHICH CLEARLY YOU AREN'T.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.768
LEAVE ME ALONE!

23:59.739 --> 24:00.907
NO.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.042
WE ARE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS,

24:03.075 --> 24:05.545
AND WE'RE GONNA
DEAL WITH THIS.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.448
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.952
FINE.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.221
UNLESS...

24:15.254 --> 24:18.825
UNLESS...YES, I DO.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.627
I DO HAVE LEGS.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.197
I SEE YOU DIDN'T FACTOR THOSE
INTO YOUR BRILLIANT PLAN.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.744
LANE, CAN YOU
TRY TO HOLD STILL?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.512
I'M TRYING.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.047
REAL HARD.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.882
[groans]

24:42.915 --> 24:46.886
GUY IS TOUGH.
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.155
MY PREFRONTAL CORTEX
IS A LITTLE AROUSED.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.890
JUST GET
THE DAMN PICTURE.

24:50.923 --> 24:51.991

24:52.024 --> 24:54.927
[groans]

24:54.961 --> 24:57.029
I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR VIEW
OF HIS AORTA YET.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.230
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.
WE HAVE TO STOP.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.632
NO. YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT HIM

24:59.666 --> 25:01.668
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO SAVE HIM.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.102
HE'S SMOKING.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.771
LITERALLY, YOU ASS.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.138

25:06.172 --> 25:07.139
NO, GETTING A GOOD IMAGE

25:07.173 --> 25:08.174
ISN'T GONNA MEAN ANYTHING

25:08.207 --> 25:09.241
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE
A RIB CAGE.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.544

25:11.578 --> 25:13.613

25:49.949 --> 25:53.119
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO HIM EVENTUALLY.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.022
HE NEEDS YOU.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.293
I LOVE HIM.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.731
AND I KNOW HE LOVES ME.

26:04.764 --> 26:05.832
BUT I JUST CAN'T...

26:05.865 --> 26:07.934
HE NEEDS YOU IN HIS LIFE.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.671
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING
WITH HIM, HE NEEDS YOU.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.040
WITHOUT YOU--

26:14.073 --> 26:16.676
YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.949
I CAN'T FIX HIS PROBLEM.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.354
I AM HIS PROBLEM.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.703
IF THE INFECTION'S
NOT IN HIS HEART,

26:43.736 --> 26:45.838
THEN IT'S IN HIS BRAIN.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.273
YOU'RE IN MY SUN.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.108
DO A CT.
WE CAN'T.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.142
HE HAS A TITANIUM PLATE

26:50.176 --> 26:51.143
AND A BUNCH
OF METAL SCREWS.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.411
GET RID OF THEM.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.814
HIS SKULL HAS MULTIPLE
HAIRLINE FRACTURES.

26:54.847 --> 26:55.815
REMOVING THE METAL PLATE

26:55.848 --> 26:57.016
WILL BE LIKE REMOVING

26:57.049 --> 26:59.085
HALF AN EGGSHELL
WITHOUT CRACKING

26:59.118 --> 27:00.086
THE REST OF THE SHELL.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.020
AND NOT REMOVING THE PLATE

27:01.053 --> 27:02.822
WILL BE LIKE LEAVING
THE EGG OUT TO ROT.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.657
WE CAN'T CUT OFF
THE TOP OF HIS HEAD

27:04.691 --> 27:05.958
BASED ON A FEW SYMPTOMS
THAT DISAPPEAR

27:05.992 --> 27:08.127
WHENEVER WE TRY
TO TEST FOR THEM.

27:10.462 --> 27:14.433
WHAT IF THE ONE SYMPTOM
THAT HASN'T DISAPPEARED

27:14.466 --> 27:16.803
WAS NEVER ACTUALLY THERE?

27:16.836 --> 27:19.138
ANY DELAYS
WHEN HE ANSWERS QUESTIONS?

27:20.973 --> 27:23.910
HE DOESN'T HAVE
PARTIAL HEARING LOSS.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.912
HE'S MISSING MOMENTS.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.279
HE REPORTED HAVING SOMETHING

27:27.313 --> 27:30.316
LIKE A COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURE
DURING A BULL RIDE.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.284
SAID IT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE,
BUT WHAT IF HE'S WRONG?

27:32.318 --> 27:33.953
WHAT IF THE INFECTION
IN THE BRAIN

27:33.986 --> 27:35.454
IS CAUSING IT
TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME?

27:35.487 --> 27:38.190
HIS E.E.G. DIDN'T SHOW ANY SIGN
OF SEIZURE ACTIVITY.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.125
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A SEIZURE.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.960
I SAID IT WAS SOMETHING
LIKE A SEIZURE.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.328
AND I'M GUESSING
YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL US

27:42.361 --> 27:44.296
WE NEED TO FIND SOMETHING
LIKE AN E.E.G. TO PROVE--

27:44.330 --> 27:46.332

27:53.072 --> 27:54.073
(House)
IT WON'T.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.975
IT'S JUST GONNA PROVE
THAT WE NEED

27:56.008 --> 27:57.844
TO CUT INTO YOUR SKULL,

27:57.877 --> 27:59.478
WHICH IS GONNA
BE KIND OF DANGEROUS.

I HATE
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.050
YOU RESPOND TO WHAT YOU THINK
I'M THINKING,

29:11.083 --> 29:14.053

THAT I THINK LIKE YOU DO.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.048
WHERE IT CAN BE REPAIRED
INSIDE THE 60 SECONDS

30:49.081 --> 30:50.149
IT'LL TAKE HIM
TO BLEED TO DEATH.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.317
(Chase)
IT'S A RIDICULOUS IDEA.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.518
IT WON'T WORK.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.020
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND...

30:54.053 --> 30:56.355
GET THIS GUY'S APPROVAL
TO RIP HIS HEART OPEN.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.904
HEY.

31:11.938 --> 31:15.307
WE THINK YOU HAVE
A BARTONELLA INFECTION,

31:15.341 --> 31:18.544
WHICH CAUSED A MYCOTIC ANEURYSM
IN YOUR AORTIC WALL.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.279
WE NEED TO FIND IT,

31:20.312 --> 31:23.149
WHICH MEANS WE NEED
TO BLOW UP YOUR HEART.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.918
AND, YES, I'M AS SERIOUS
AS A HEART ATTACK.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.120
WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE

31:28.154 --> 31:31.423
UNTIL THE WEAK SPOT
IN YOUR AORTIC WALL EXPLODES.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.925
HOPEFULLY WE'LL
BE ABLE TO FIX IT

31:32.959 --> 31:34.593
BEFORE YOU BLEED TO DEATH.

31:34.626 --> 31:38.931
ANY QUESTIONS?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.599
NOPE.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.102
REALLY?

31:43.135 --> 31:44.436
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW

31:44.470 --> 31:46.672
IF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO
BACK TO BULL RIDING?

31:46.705 --> 31:47.606
I ASSUME NO?

31:47.639 --> 31:50.209
I MEAN, YOU'VE ALREADY
CRACKED OPEN MY SKULL,

31:50.242 --> 31:54.146
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
BLOW UP MY HEART.

31:54.180 --> 31:57.049
THOUGHT YOU LOVED
THOSE EIGHT SECONDS.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.458
I DO.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.696
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I GOT TO GIVE THEM UP.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.435
I CAN ALWAYS FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO LOVE.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.643
(Cuddy)
HOUSE.

32:24.676 --> 32:28.014
WE NEED TO TALK.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.658
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME
TO SAY YES

32:39.691 --> 32:41.660
TO RUPTURING HIS AORTA,
DID YOU?

32:41.693 --> 32:43.295
SINCE I DIDN'T ASK,

32:43.329 --> 32:46.032
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU
TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.400
YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE
THIS WILL SAVE HIS LIFE.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.269
REALLY?

32:50.302 --> 32:51.737
NO REASON? NONE AT ALL?

32:51.770 --> 32:53.639
I'M JUST PLANNING ON
CRACKING OPEN HIS CHEST,

32:53.672 --> 32:56.575
BLOWING UP HIS HEART,
WHAT, TO PAD HIS BILL?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.344
OR YOU THINK THAT SINCE
YOU BROKE MY HEART

32:58.377 --> 33:02.081
I WANT TO BREAK HIS.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.615
I DON'T KNOW.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.552
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

33:06.585 --> 33:09.688
THAT CAN EXCITE YOU.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.058
FILL A VOID.

33:12.091 --> 33:15.461
AND IT'S AFFECTING
YOUR JUDGMENT.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.030
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM.

33:18.064 --> 33:21.033
MY DAMAGED, DEPRESSED,
DRUG-ADDLED JUDGMENT

33:21.067 --> 33:21.933
IS STILL BETTER THAN YOURS

33:21.967 --> 33:23.069
OR ANY OTHER DOCTOR
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

33:23.102 --> 33:27.039
AND MY TEAM IS GONNA DO THIS
PROCEDURE AND SAVE HIS LIFE.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.441
SO YOU CAN EITHER HAVE SECURITY
ARREST ME AND MY TEAM,

33:29.475 --> 33:34.413
OR YOU CAN GET
THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.781
AND SHE CAVES.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.261
(Chase)
RIB SPREADER IN PLACE.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.462

33:50.496 --> 33:53.299

I TAKE IT YOU
RATTED ME OUT TO CUDDY.

34:03.675 --> 34:09.115
I THINK YOUR JUDGMENT
IS COMPROMISED.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.083
NO, YOU DON'T.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.418
[over intercom]
COME ON.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.652
I GOT A SQUASH GAME AT 2:00.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.121
LET'S GIVE THIS COWBOY A RIDE.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.288
(Foreman)
IF I INJECT MORE,

34:16.322 --> 34:17.456
THERE WON'T BE ANY ROOM
FOR THE BLOOD

34:17.489 --> 34:18.457
TO GO THROUGH
THE REST OF HIS BODY.

34:18.490 --> 34:21.093
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.162
LET'S MAKE DAMN SURE
WE DON'T DAMAGE HIS TOES

34:23.195 --> 34:24.396
WHILE WE BLOW UP
HIS HEART.

34:28.767 --> 34:32.138
[beeping increases]

34:37.376 --> 34:38.710
NO BUBBLES,
NO BRUISING, NO GAPS.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.480
IT'S NOT WORKING.

34:41.513 --> 34:44.082
YES, IT IS.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.689
I WAS WRONG.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.491
NOT YET.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.692
(Chase)
LET'S SWITCH HIM OVER TO
BYPASS FOR THE DEBRIDEMENT.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.227
COME ON.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.296
SLOW THE HEART DOWN
SO IT DOESN'T--

34:57.329 --> 34:58.664
DAMN.

34:58.697 --> 34:59.798
(Chase)
CLAMP.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.467
WE CAN'T CLAMP THE AORTA
AT THIS PRESSURE.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.534
EVEN IF YOU CAN SEE
THROUGH ALL THE BLOOD.

35:02.568 --> 35:03.335
DO IT ANYWAY.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.637
WE NEED SUCTION
AND MORE SPONGES.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.307
LEAK IS TOO FAST.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.809
NO, IT'S NOT.
WE CAN FIX THIS.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.686
[sustained tone]

35:28.760 --> 35:32.864
[device beeping normally]

35:37.636 --> 35:39.805
IT WORKED.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.743
(Foreman)
HOUSE, IT WORKED.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.880
I HEARD YOU.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.684
HEY.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.387
I'M AWAKE,
SO I GUESS IT WORKED.

36:28.420 --> 36:32.924
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET
YOUR HEART RATE TOO HIGH.

36:32.958 --> 36:36.695
YOU, UH, PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE SEX FOR A WHILE.

36:36.728 --> 36:37.996
[clears throat]

36:38.029 --> 36:39.465
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.504
WANT TO HANG OUT,
SEE YOUR RANCH SOMETIME?

36:45.537 --> 36:48.740
UH...

36:54.346 --> 36:56.682
THAT WOULD PROBABLY
BE INAPPROPRIATE,

36:56.715 --> 37:00.452
'CAUSE I'M YOUR DOCTOR
AND EVERYTHING.

37:04.556 --> 37:08.294
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

NO.

37:37.323 --> 37:38.690
YEAH,
SORRY ABOUT THE NOISE.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.726
I GUESS, UH,
THEIR TEAM WON.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.729
ALTHOUGH I GOT
TO TELL YOU,

37:43.762 --> 37:46.498
SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD STILL
ACT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

37:46.532 --> 37:47.699
JUST LET LOOSE.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.441
AH, I GUESS IT'S
A LITTLE EASIER, THOUGH,

37:55.474 --> 37:56.442
WHEN YOU GOT NO TROUBLES.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.644
PARENTS STILL
PAYING YOUR BILLS.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.747

AHEAD OF YOU.
