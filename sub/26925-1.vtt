Well, your work is good,
it's fresh... original.

00:34.038 --> 00:34.835
Thank you.

00:34.870 --> 00:35.899
But you haven't worked
in a while.

00:35.935 --> 00:36.865
Why are you interested

in a full-time position

What do you mean by that?

00:44.355 --> 00:45.118
Oh, thank you.

00:45.153 --> 00:48.747
Um, well,
my ex-husband and I...

00:48.782 --> 00:50.411
got married right after college

00:50.446 --> 00:53.073
and moved up to the city
and I worked in advertising

00:53.108 --> 00:55.037
for a few years,

00:55.073 --> 00:56.868
but when RayAnne came along,

00:56.904 --> 00:57.866
I--

00:57.902 --> 00:59.863
oh, that's my daughter--

00:59.899 --> 01:00.829
Oh.

01:00.864 --> 01:01.593
...I stopped working

01:01.628 --> 01:04.158
and became
a stay-at-home mom.

01:04.193 --> 01:06.519
And that's a full-time job
in itself.

01:06.555 --> 01:07.352
Oh, yes, it is,

01:07.388 --> 01:09.514
and I've loved
every minute of it,

01:09.550 --> 01:11.180
but Ray's growing up,

01:11.215 --> 01:13.442
and I need a job,
and here I am.

01:13.478 --> 01:15.639
Well, working in
a New York ad agency,

01:15.675 --> 01:18.268
the hours here
can be very demanding.

01:18.303 --> 01:21.530
Oh, yes. I remember,
and I'm ready for that.

01:21.565 --> 01:23.961

the place you want to be?

01:23.996 --> 01:24.925
I do.

01:24.961 --> 01:26.923

Wow! That's a long time ago!

Yeah. [laughs]
Just kidding.

09:59.125 --> 10:02.817
Yeah... go ahead,
you've already got it started.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.081
[Todd]: Merry Christmas.

10:04.116 --> 10:05.579
Merry Christmas.

10:05.614 --> 10:06.745
Don't fall off
the ladder, honey.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.941
Thank you, dear.

10:10.607 --> 10:13.169
Ah. Ooh! It is chilly out here.
Should we get you girls inside?

10:13.204 --> 10:14.966
- Hot chocolate?
- Definitely.

10:21.058 --> 10:22.654
[RayAnne]: Wow.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.984
I really like this house,
Mommy.

10:25.019 --> 10:26.016
I'm glad you do!

10:27.315 --> 10:28.644
Can I go pick out my room?

10:28.679 --> 10:30.275
- Yes.
- Please?

10:30.311 --> 10:31.606
- Yes!
- Thank you!

10:31.642 --> 10:33.470
[laughs]

10:33.505 --> 10:35.203
She is adorable.

10:35.238 --> 10:37.865
Yeah. I like her.

10:37.899 --> 10:40.260
So the furnace has been
acting kinda funny.

10:40.296 --> 10:41.591
If you need to,
just reset it.

10:41.627 --> 10:42.958
Oh, okay. Thank you.

10:42.993 --> 10:44.054
Yeah.

10:44.089 --> 10:46.851
This house brings back
so many Christmas memories.

10:46.886 --> 10:48.581
I bet.

10:48.617 --> 10:49.681
I really wish

10:49.715 --> 10:51.443
I could've gotten down here
more in the last years,

10:51.478 --> 10:53.840
but... you know.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.604
Life?

10:55.639 --> 10:56.968
Yeah. Life.

10:58.669 --> 11:00.897
I was sorry to hear
about you and Jon.

11:00.932 --> 11:03.127
How are things,
if I can ask?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.924
O...kay.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.289
He's great with RayAnne.

11:06.324 --> 11:09.916
He's taking her
to Hawaii for Christmas.

11:10.950 --> 11:13.677
[♪♪♪]

11:50.557 --> 11:52.552
What about you?

11:52.588 --> 11:55.149
Oh, I'm-I'm staying here
for the holiday.

11:55.185 --> 11:56.512
That's not what I meant.

11:56.547 --> 11:57.544
Yeah, I know.

11:58.746 --> 12:02.670
Uh, things have been tough,
but I'm getting through it.

12:02.706 --> 12:04.301
Good.

12:04.336 --> 12:07.862
You know, if you need anything,
I am... right there.

12:09.928 --> 12:11.658
- Thank you, Di.
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.990 --> 12:15.019
Oh, actually,
there is one thing.

12:15.055 --> 12:16.883
Could you recommend a realtor?

12:16.918 --> 12:19.279
Um...
Lou Williams is good,

12:19.314 --> 12:21.276
but I don't know,

12:21.311 --> 12:24.105
I was kind of hoping maybe
you guys might be moving in.

12:24.141 --> 12:26.268
[chuckles] Yeah, no.

12:26.303 --> 12:29.097
I gotta get back to the city
and get a job.

12:29.965 --> 12:31.861
[Todd]: Dianne!

12:31.895 --> 12:33.191
Who could that be?

12:33.226 --> 12:36.086
I'll see you later.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.451
Ray! Have you
picked out a room yet?

12:38.486 --> 12:39.615
[RayAnne]: Yeah! I did!

12:39.651 --> 12:42.079
[Sydney]: Oh, goodie!

12:43.013 --> 12:43.975
Hey.

12:44.011 --> 12:45.706
Look what I found!

12:46.973 --> 12:48.568
Grandma's ornaments.

12:48.604 --> 12:51.498
You know, she collected these
for years.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.428
I wonder if she still has
the one that we gave her

12:53.462 --> 12:56.389
for your first Christmas?

12:56.425 --> 12:58.421
- Is this one it?
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.456 --> 12:59.918
It's really pretty.

12:59.953 --> 13:00.717
Mm-hmm.

13:00.752 --> 13:03.180
Can we hang them up
on the tree?

13:04.147 --> 13:06.408
Actually, I was thinking
that maybe we don't do

13:06.443 --> 13:07.474
a tree this year.

13:07.509 --> 13:08.572
Why not?

13:08.608 --> 13:10.303
Because you're going to be
with your dad in Hawaii

13:10.338 --> 13:11.168
on Christmas Eve

13:11.204 --> 13:14.363
and I'm gonna be here
by myself, so...

13:14.399 --> 13:15.162
So?

13:15.198 --> 13:16.859
So I was kind of
looking forward

13:16.895 --> 13:19.623
to not having to put up a tree
because...

13:19.657 --> 13:21.286
it is a lot of work--

13:21.321 --> 13:23.584
you gotta put it up
and then take it down,

13:23.619 --> 13:26.245
and clean up all those
pine needles...

13:27.479 --> 13:29.674
And what are you going to do
for Christmas instead?

13:29.709 --> 13:30.706
I don't know.

13:31.874 --> 13:33.568
Maybe I'll go on a trip.

13:33.603 --> 13:37.662
I have never been to Paris.
I've always wanted to go.

13:37.697 --> 13:38.927
This could be my chance.

13:38.962 --> 13:41.322
Mom, you're not going to Paris!

13:42.356 --> 13:44.053
...Without me.

13:44.088 --> 13:46.282
[Sydney laughs] Deal.

13:47.716 --> 13:49.177
Look.

13:49.212 --> 13:52.007
Your dad and I
both love you very much,

13:52.042 --> 13:53.038
and we both agreed

13:53.073 --> 13:54.870
that you would spend
half the holiday with me,

13:54.906 --> 13:55.735
and then half with him.

13:55.770 --> 13:57.698
So you're going to get
to go Hawaii,

13:57.734 --> 13:59.195
and you're going to have
so much fun,

13:59.231 --> 14:00.561
and then you're gonna come back

14:00.596 --> 14:02.324
and you're gonna tell me
all about it, okay?

14:02.359 --> 14:04.288
Okay.

14:05.354 --> 14:07.018
I love you, Mom.

14:07.053 --> 14:08.447
I love you, too.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.476
What do you say we go get
the bags out of the car

14:12.512 --> 14:14.041
and then we come back in

14:14.075 --> 14:15.771
and we get ready to go

14:15.807 --> 14:17.536
to the Christmas tree-lighting
ceremony, huh?

14:17.571 --> 14:18.766
Deal.

14:18.802 --> 14:20.830
Okay. Come on.

14:23.995 --> 14:26.421
[school bell ringing]

14:28.953 --> 14:31.148
I never thought 3:00
would get here.

14:31.184 --> 14:33.311
Why does the day
before Christmas break

14:32.447 --> 14:35.076
always seem to last forever?

14:35.110 --> 14:36.075
I know!

14:36.110 --> 14:38.303
Do you have any plans
for the holidays, Kenny?

14:38.339 --> 14:40.102
What, me?
Yeah, you know.

14:40.137 --> 14:41.666
A little of this,
a little of that.

14:41.701 --> 14:43.396
Very mysterious.

14:43.432 --> 14:45.093
Mm. How 'bout you?

14:45.128 --> 14:48.156
I am looking forward
to two weeks of peace and quiet,

14:48.191 --> 14:50.820
and finally getting started
on my new novel.

14:50.855 --> 14:52.250
I thought you were
working on that last summer?

14:52.285 --> 14:53.815
Oh... kinda.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.079
You mean you still
haven't started?

14:55.114 --> 14:57.109
Oh, I know, I know.

14:57.145 --> 14:58.107
I get writer's block,

14:58.143 --> 14:59.806
something I'm hoping I get over
this holiday.

14:59.841 --> 15:01.436
Well, good luck.

15:01.471 --> 15:03.434
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.363
Merry Christmas.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.157
Merry Christmas.

15:11.989 --> 15:13.052
Hey, Bea.

15:13.087 --> 15:13.885
Oh, hey, Mac.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.348
I finished
the holiday reading list

15:15.384 --> 15:16.347
for the kids in my class.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.413
Great!

15:17.448 --> 15:18.611
Some of 'em might be
coming in over Christmas.

15:18.646 --> 15:20.574
It'd be great if you could
point 'em to the right books.

15:20.610 --> 15:21.572
Of course. Happy to help.

15:21.608 --> 15:24.335
Oh! Sydney has a daughter

15:24.371 --> 15:26.532
the same age as the children
in your class.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.029
- Who?
- Sydney?

15:28.064 --> 15:31.258
The lovely young woman
you met earlier...

15:31.293 --> 15:34.054
the one who thought
you were shoplifting.

15:34.090 --> 15:36.317
Oh! Right.
How could I forget?

15:36.353 --> 15:39.013
She's spending Christmas
here in town.

15:39.048 --> 15:40.079
And...?

15:40.114 --> 15:41.442
She's single.

15:42.543 --> 15:45.036
[chuckles] Yeah. Bea...

15:45.072 --> 15:47.034
I told you, I'm not...

15:47.070 --> 15:49.331
I'm not looking to get
involved with anybody.

15:49.367 --> 15:50.330
Yet.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.528
"Yet"?

15:51.564 --> 15:53.392
You're not trying to get
involved with anybody <i>yet.</i>

15:53.427 --> 15:56.853
You never know.
She might be the one.

15:56.888 --> 15:59.116
Yeah, she might be.
Bea, I love you. I got to go.

15:59.152 --> 16:00.946
Yeah. A-Are you going

16:00.981 --> 16:02.611
to the tree-lighting
ceremony tonight?

16:02.647 --> 16:03.844
I hadn't planned on it.

16:03.879 --> 16:04.874
Oh.

16:04.909 --> 16:07.138
Oh. Okay, well, n-never mind.

16:07.173 --> 16:08.503
I'm sure I'll be fine.

you're sure you'll be fine?

16:10.867 --> 16:13.029

16:13.064 --> 16:14.826

dark and...

16:16.194 --> 16:17.455
cold and...

being icy,

you just never know

No. I-I will just
miss this year.

may have heard,

this will be my final Christmas
as your mayor.

- Aw!
- Boo.

Now, I have loved

18:18.419 --> 18:19.548
every minute of it,

to step aside

18:21.481 --> 18:23.443
and welcome some fresh faces.

everybody will join me

one to remember.

to her bookstore

Gonna go to Hawaii?

19:10.674 --> 19:11.704
You gonna learn how to surf?

19:11.739 --> 19:12.869
Probably.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.167
Very cool.

19:14.202 --> 19:15.830
Mom, I'm getting
a bit cold.

19:15.866 --> 19:17.761
Oh, okay, honey.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.125
[Mayor]: Okay, here we go!

19:19.161 --> 19:21.190
Let's all count down.

19:21.225 --> 19:21.988
Five...

19:22.024 --> 19:24.585
[crowd joins in]:
...Four, three,

19:24.621 --> 19:27.080
two, one...

19:27.116 --> 19:29.245
[cheering erupts]

19:32.143 --> 19:33.305
- Oh!
- Sorry!

19:34.671 --> 19:36.033
You okay?

19:39.364 --> 19:41.393
[♪♪♪]

19:41.429 --> 19:42.956
Yeah. So, um...

19:42.992 --> 19:44.489
it was really nice
talking to you.

19:44.524 --> 19:45.784
Come, honey,
we got to go home now.

19:45.820 --> 19:47.816
- What?
- It's getting late.

19:47.851 --> 19:49.779
[♪♪♪]

19:53.842 --> 19:55.438
[RayAnne]: They just turned
the lights on, Mom.

19:55.474 --> 19:57.036
Why do we have to leave
so soon?

19:57.071 --> 19:58.401
Well, because, you know,

19:58.436 --> 19:59.898
we haven't unpacked everything,

19:59.933 --> 20:01.363
and it's our first night
in the house,

20:01.399 --> 20:03.858
and I thought we should
get back to the place.

20:05.325 --> 20:06.621
[ignition sputtering]

20:06.656 --> 20:07.687
Oh...

20:07.722 --> 20:08.718
[sputtering continues]

20:08.753 --> 20:10.914
And the car's not starting.

20:10.950 --> 20:11.913
Hmm.

20:11.948 --> 20:13.212
[knocks]

20:14.245 --> 20:16.007
Oh...

20:17.042 --> 20:18.570
You dropped this.

20:18.605 --> 20:21.034
Oh! Thank you.
Appreciate it.

20:21.070 --> 20:22.896
Our car won't start, Mac.

20:22.932 --> 20:24.096
Oh?

20:24.131 --> 20:26.391
Uh, it's probably
just cold...

20:26.427 --> 20:27.889
We're fine.

20:27.925 --> 20:29.819
Well, pop the hood.
I'll take a look.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.684
Oh, no, you don't need to.
Thanks, though.

20:31.718 --> 20:33.449
Please, Mom?

20:34.748 --> 20:35.810
Really, it's nothing.

20:35.846 --> 20:36.676
Uh...

20:36.711 --> 20:38.141
[hood pops open]

20:41.704 --> 20:43.400
Well...

20:43.435 --> 20:45.630
looks like it's your...

20:45.665 --> 20:46.728
fuel pump.

20:46.763 --> 20:48.858
The garage can fix it,

20:48.894 --> 20:51.653
but they won't be open
till the morning.

20:52.888 --> 20:55.315
Okay, well, thank you.

20:55.350 --> 20:57.944
I think I'll just call an Uber.
Thanks.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.376
[amused]: In Hopewell?

20:59.411 --> 21:00.408
Good luck with that.

21:00.443 --> 21:03.037
Let me get my truck.
I'll give you a ride home.

21:03.072 --> 21:05.633
No, you really don't need to.
You've already done enough.

21:05.668 --> 21:07.497
I don't want you
to drive out of your way.

21:07.532 --> 21:08.495
We're up on Pine,

21:08.530 --> 21:09.494
by the park.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.857
Is that the red house
with the yellow trim?

21:11.892 --> 21:13.089
You know it?

21:13.124 --> 21:14.652
Well, yeah,
my sister lives next door.

21:14.687 --> 21:16.517
You're Diane's brother?

21:16.552 --> 21:17.782
[laughs] Yeah.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.446
Small world, huh?

21:19.481 --> 21:20.978
Small world.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.574
Mom, it's getting cold in here.

21:23.541 --> 21:24.804
[Mac]: Well?

21:24.840 --> 21:26.401
How about that ride?

21:26.437 --> 21:28.765
Thank you.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.128
Okay, hon'.

21:32.462 --> 21:34.888
[♪♪♪]

21:34.924 --> 21:37.087
[Sydney]: Thanks for the ride.

21:37.122 --> 21:38.017
Yeah. Any time.

21:38.053 --> 21:39.582
[RayAnne]:
It's freezing in our house!

21:39.617 --> 21:41.579
Can you fix the heater, Mac?

21:41.614 --> 21:43.709
[Mac]: Yeah, sure.
I'll take a look.

21:45.076 --> 21:47.438
Huh.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.969
Thermostat's busted.

21:49.003 --> 21:51.033
Yeah, we've been having
trouble with the furnace.

21:51.066 --> 21:53.861
It doesn't seem to be
keeping the place very warm.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.225
Well, I can take a look.

21:55.260 --> 21:59.120
Oh. Uh... sure.
If you don't mind.

21:59.155 --> 22:00.884
Not at all. Didn't drive you
all the way out here

22:00.920 --> 22:01.882
just to have you freeze.

22:01.918 --> 22:03.713
[laughs] Thanks. Yeah.

22:03.748 --> 22:06.276
The furnace is just
through the door, down there.

22:06.311 --> 22:08.006
I'm gonna run upstairs
and check on Ray.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.070
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah. Sure.

22:12.102 --> 22:14.929
Ray! It's time for bed.

22:18.925 --> 22:21.353
Uh-uh-uh.
Straight to bed, honey.

22:21.388 --> 22:22.584
Can I just read?

22:22.619 --> 22:23.884
It is getting late.

22:23.918 --> 22:25.381
Ten minutes?

22:25.416 --> 22:27.044
Five minutes.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.541
Okay.

22:28.577 --> 22:30.473
Can you say goodnight
to Mac for me?

22:31.605 --> 22:33.136
Of course.

22:33.171 --> 22:34.168
Thanks.

22:34.201 --> 22:35.465
I love you, Mom.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.729
I love you. Goodnight.

22:37.764 --> 22:39.525
Thanks.

22:39.561 --> 22:41.857
Wait! Maybe kiss me
two more times,

22:41.891 --> 22:43.686
because three times
is a charm.

22:43.722 --> 22:45.516
[Sydney laughs]

22:45.552 --> 22:47.215
Mwah! Mwa-a-ah.

22:47.249 --> 22:48.379
There!

22:48.414 --> 22:49.511
All right.

22:49.547 --> 22:51.507
Bed.

22:53.474 --> 22:55.767
[♪♪♪]

22:59.798 --> 23:02.293
Thank you again
for fixing the furnace.

23:02.327 --> 23:03.789
Yeah, no problem.

23:03.825 --> 23:04.855
It is an old system, though,

23:04.890 --> 23:07.350
so when you get a chance,
you should replace it.

23:07.385 --> 23:08.648
Oh. Uh-huh.

23:08.684 --> 23:10.812
Yeah.

23:10.847 --> 23:13.242
Mm. That's really good.

23:14.374 --> 23:15.638
- So, listen, I--
- I wanted--

23:15.674 --> 23:17.003
[both chuckling]

23:17.038 --> 23:18.933
Please. You first.

23:18.968 --> 23:21.297
I just wanted to apologize
for running away from you

23:21.332 --> 23:23.394
at the tree ceremony...

23:23.429 --> 23:24.557
It was kind of rude.

23:24.593 --> 23:25.623
Ah. Don't worry about it.

23:25.659 --> 23:28.319
I just haven't been out much
since my divorce,

23:28.354 --> 23:32.081
much less been set up
by anyone, so...

23:32.116 --> 23:34.809
I guess I forgot
how to act in public.

23:34.844 --> 23:36.873
Yeah, well,
Bea's a really sweet lady,

23:36.908 --> 23:37.972
but she doesn't seem
to like the idea

23:38.007 --> 23:39.137
of anybody being single.

23:39.172 --> 23:42.066
Yeah! What is with that?

23:42.101 --> 23:43.963
I've only been divorced a year
and, already,

23:43.998 --> 23:45.961
everybody want me
to get married again.

23:45.996 --> 23:47.689
Well, I don't know about you,
but I like being single.

23:47.725 --> 23:48.688
So do I!

23:48.724 --> 23:49.788
You can do whatever you want.

23:49.823 --> 23:50.852
Whenever you want.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.916
And you don't have
to have some big discussion

23:52.952 --> 23:54.579
about what movie to go see.

23:54.615 --> 23:57.243
Exactly. Or what toppings
you want to put on your pizza.

23:57.278 --> 23:58.774
And if you want to wake up
in the middle of the night

23:58.809 --> 24:00.371
and dance around
in the living room

24:00.406 --> 24:01.403
to your favorite song,
you can.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.366
Yes, you can.
You can do that.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.564
Yeah. Yeah.

24:05.599 --> 24:07.993
It's good to be alone.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.323
Yeah, it is...
it is good to be...

24:12.756 --> 24:14.185
Do you do that?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.448
What?

24:15.483 --> 24:17.478
Dance around in the middle of
the night in your living room?

24:17.514 --> 24:20.175
Sometimes. Yeah.

24:21.541 --> 24:23.403
Why are you
looking at me like that?

24:23.438 --> 24:24.368
Nothing, nothing.
So do I.

24:24.404 --> 24:26.068
- No, you don't.
- No, you're right, I don't.

24:26.103 --> 24:27.065
I don't, but I could.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.029
Yeah, I'd like to see that.

24:31.061 --> 24:32.024
Cheers.

24:32.060 --> 24:33.755
- Cheers.

24:52.629 --> 24:54.956
Thinking of decorating a tree
for Christmas?

24:54.991 --> 24:56.687
Oh. Well... um...

24:56.722 --> 24:57.485
Better hurry.

24:57.521 --> 24:59.649
Christmas is only
two weeks away.

24:59.684 --> 25:01.980
Why don't you keep that one?

25:02.016 --> 25:02.810
Really?

25:02.846 --> 25:03.776
Yeah.

25:03.811 --> 25:05.907
It's the season of giving--
and receiving.

25:05.943 --> 25:07.937
Think of it
as a little "thank you" gift.

25:07.972 --> 25:09.767
Thank you.

25:09.802 --> 25:12.631
Thank you...
for everything.

25:14.163 --> 25:15.492
Have a good night.

25:15.527 --> 25:16.956
Good night.

25:18.424 --> 25:21.084
Oh, I've got the door.

25:23.115 --> 25:25.744

25:29.806 --> 25:31.168
That's silly.

27:07.854 --> 27:09.583
Come on, Bea.

27:09.618 --> 27:12.478
At least think it over.
It's a Hopewell tradition.

27:12.513 --> 27:14.943
Oh, good morning, Sydney.
Morning RayAnne.

27:14.979 --> 27:16.206
Hi, Bea!

27:16.242 --> 27:17.972
I love <i>The Christmas Road</i>
and I'm almost finished it!

27:18.007 --> 27:19.401
You are?

27:19.436 --> 27:20.766
Yeah! And I love it so much,

27:20.801 --> 27:23.064
I'm gonna go look
for another book!

27:23.099 --> 27:26.424
Okay. [chuckles]
Oh! Which reminds me, Sydney--

27:26.460 --> 27:30.053
I found something
I think you might like, too.

27:30.088 --> 27:32.915
[Mayor]: Bea always knows
how to pick out the right book.

27:32.951 --> 27:34.113
I am becoming a believer.

27:34.149 --> 27:35.046
Oh, Curtis, this is

27:35.080 --> 27:37.242
Elizabeth Darton's
granddaughter, Sydney.

27:37.277 --> 27:39.438
And our mayor, Curtis Gray.

27:39.473 --> 27:40.503
I heard
that you'd come to town.

27:40.539 --> 27:41.501
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

27:41.537 --> 27:45.696
Maybe you can help me
change this lady's mind.

27:45.731 --> 27:47.261
[sighs]
I've told you, Curtis.

27:47.297 --> 27:49.723
I'm just not
interested this year.

27:49.758 --> 27:50.689
Interested in what?

27:50.724 --> 27:52.286
In the Christmas Carousel.

27:52.321 --> 27:54.051
What is "Christmas Carousel"?

27:54.085 --> 27:55.182
For the last 10 years,

27:55.217 --> 27:56.413
on December 23rd,

27:56.448 --> 27:58.943
the Main Street merchants
have stayed open

27:58.978 --> 28:01.838
and served hot cocoa
and cookies.

28:01.873 --> 28:02.704
Yeah, people stop by

28:02.739 --> 28:04.334
and admire the Christmas tree
displays

28:04.369 --> 28:06.398
and get some last-minute
shopping done.

28:06.433 --> 28:07.398
At the end,

28:07.432 --> 28:08.262
we judge the windows displays

28:08.297 --> 28:09.726
and we hand out a prize
to the winner.

28:09.762 --> 28:11.856
Hmm. Well, that sounds lovely.

28:11.892 --> 28:14.519
It is.
But it is also a lot of work.

28:14.554 --> 28:18.247
Putting up the new display,
arranging snacks...

28:18.282 --> 28:21.908
I am just getting too old
to do all of that alone.

28:21.943 --> 28:22.907
Too old?

28:22.942 --> 28:23.905
You?

28:23.940 --> 28:24.903
Mm.

28:24.938 --> 28:27.034
That is just ridiculous, Bea.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.831
As far as I'm concerned,

28:28.867 --> 28:30.996
you are still
the same sweet, young girl

28:31.029 --> 28:32.992
that I took
to the high-school prom.

28:34.060 --> 28:37.252
Are you flirting with me,
Mr. Mayor?

28:39.551 --> 28:40.946
Well, duty calls.

28:40.981 --> 28:41.746
Mm-hmm.

28:41.781 --> 28:42.944
It was nice
to meet you, Sydney.

28:42.979 --> 28:44.841
Nice to meet you, too.

28:44.876 --> 28:45.840
Merry Christmas.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.105
[Sydney]: Merry Christmas.

28:48.636 --> 28:50.166
Hmm!

28:50.202 --> 28:51.930
[Bea laughs]

28:53.296 --> 28:55.358
So, the truth is,

28:55.393 --> 28:57.688
I feel badly about
letting everybody down

28:57.724 --> 28:58.986
about the Christmas Carousel,

28:59.022 --> 29:02.414
but running this store
by myself,

29:02.449 --> 29:04.943
it's already too much.

29:06.976 --> 29:08.571

01:18:14.526 --> 01:18:15.921
Right?

01:18:15.956 --> 01:18:16.986
I agree.

01:18:17.021 --> 01:18:17.985
Okay.

01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.218
Deal.

01:18:19.253 --> 01:18:21.880
[♪♪♪]

01:18:23.179 --> 01:18:24.575
[Bea and Sydney laugh]

01:18:24.611 --> 01:18:26.506
Ah, I'm sorry, Lou.

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:28.003
[Sydney laughs]

01:18:28.039 --> 01:18:30.467
That's okay.
Congratulations, Bea.

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:31.499
Thank you.

01:18:32.532 --> 01:18:33.362
Merry Christmas.

01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:35.924
[Bea and Sydney]:
Merry Christmas.

01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:41.017
Merry Christmas, Sydney.

01:18:41.052 --> 01:18:42.217
[laughs]

01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:45.278
You know, it feels like,
for the first time in a while,

01:18:45.314 --> 01:18:47.342
it actually will be one.

01:18:47.377 --> 01:18:50.071
[♪♪♪]

01:18:59.857 --> 01:19:02.419
So? What are you
gonna do now, Bea?

01:19:02.454 --> 01:19:06.013
Hmm, well, I think I've seen
enough of Hopewell for now.

01:19:06.049 --> 01:19:07.646
I used to be
quite the traveler.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.907
You never really get that
out of your system.

01:19:09.942 --> 01:19:13.136
I think maybe it's time to take
another trip around the world.

01:19:13.172 --> 01:19:14.269
Ooh.

01:19:14.304 --> 01:19:16.064
Especially as I've found
a new traveling companion.

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:18.263
Our boarding passes
have arrived.

01:19:18.298 --> 01:19:21.890
We take off for our group tour
of Europe New Year's Eve.

01:19:21.925 --> 01:19:23.588
Mm.

01:19:23.623 --> 01:19:25.384
Will you lock up
for me, dear?

01:19:25.419 --> 01:19:26.250
Of course.

01:19:26.285 --> 01:19:28.679
- Merry Christmas.

[doorbell chimes]

01:20:37.978 --> 01:20:39.107
Hi.

01:20:39.143 --> 01:20:41.304
Hi...

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.169
I brought your ornament back.

01:20:44.202 --> 01:20:46.530
I-I don't have a tree
and you do have a tree,

01:20:46.565 --> 01:20:48.094
and I thought maybe
you might want it back

01:20:48.129 --> 01:20:50.358
so you could
hang it on your tree.

01:20:50.393 --> 01:20:52.354
You, uh, came
all the way out here

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:54.984
through the snow
to bring me an ornament?

01:20:55.019 --> 01:20:57.180
Uh, well,
it's Christmas Eve.

01:20:57.216 --> 01:20:58.978
I don't really have
much else to do.

01:20:59.014 --> 01:21:00.175
[Sydney chuckles lightly]

01:21:00.211 --> 01:21:01.939
Well, come on in.
It's cold.

01:21:01.975 --> 01:21:04.138
Thanks.

01:21:06.868 --> 01:21:08.463
Oh. I got that.

01:21:08.498 --> 01:21:10.295
Oh, thank you.

01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:12.656
Hmm.

01:21:12.692 --> 01:21:14.753
So, uh...

01:21:14.789 --> 01:21:16.717
- This is you?
- Yeah!

01:21:16.752 --> 01:21:18.115
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, it was.

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:19.414
Once upon a time.

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:20.878
Where'd you find that?

01:21:20.913 --> 01:21:22.143
Bea.

01:21:22.179 --> 01:21:25.138
She didn't tell me
you were the author.

01:21:25.174 --> 01:21:27.436
They say she always knows
how to pick the right book.

01:21:27.471 --> 01:21:29.032
And?

01:21:29.068 --> 01:21:31.795
This wasn't just
the right book.

01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:33.427
It was the perfect book.

01:21:35.825 --> 01:21:37.986
Listen, I'm, uh...

01:21:39.718 --> 01:21:40.781
I'm really sorry

01:21:40.817 --> 01:21:42.778
that I didn't tell you the truth

01:21:42.814 --> 01:21:44.409
about the whole
Santa Claus thing.

01:21:44.444 --> 01:21:46.041
I wanted to.

01:21:46.076 --> 01:21:47.904
Okay? I just...

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.601
I couldn't find the right time,

01:21:49.637 --> 01:21:51.498
and then so much time
had passed

01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:53.263
that it felt like
it was too late,

01:21:53.299 --> 01:21:54.894
and I didn't want to lose you.

01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:56.657
Thank you.

01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:58.056
For saying that.

01:21:58.091 --> 01:21:59.987
Okay.

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:03.814
I have something
to tell you.

01:22:02.949 --> 01:22:04.978
Yeah?

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:07.708
I'm not selling this house.

01:22:07.743 --> 01:22:09.638
You're gonna stay
in Hopewell?

01:22:09.673 --> 01:22:11.403
I am.

01:22:11.438 --> 01:22:14.498
Well, that might be the best
Christmas present I've ever had.

01:22:14.533 --> 01:22:17.926
I could think of
something better.

01:22:24.186 --> 01:22:25.614
[Ray]: Mama!

Hey, Mac! Merry Christmas!

Hey! Hi!
I brought you something.

- For your Christmas tree.

Can we hang it up now?

Yes, we can.
