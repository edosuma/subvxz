WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:04.700
Previously onCharmed...And she's a witch.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.223
A very important one,
known as

00:06.267 --> 00:08.051
the Keeper of the Sacred Flame.MEL: I'm terrified.

00:08.095 --> 00:11.185
MACY: But you took him back.Being in love is always scary.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.317
But I don't want to live
in fear of what might happen.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.714
Maggie, where are we?

00:18.757 --> 00:21.064
I have no idea.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.110
Oh, my God, Macy.
Your hand!

00:23.153 --> 00:26.243
The skin seems to be thickening,
dulling your pain receptors.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.505
Why would that happen?

00:27.549 --> 00:31.248
These are common characteristics
of a demon.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.554
I've made a decision,

00:32.597 --> 00:34.860
and I know you're not
going to like it, Mel,

00:34.904 --> 00:37.298
but I think I should
get help from Charity.

00:38.386 --> 00:42.259
So, in summation,
the dark magic

00:42.303 --> 00:44.479
that brought me back
from the dead used demon blood.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.872
And I've tried
every method I can find--

00:46.916 --> 00:49.701
scientific and mystical--
to get it out of me to no avail.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.268
So,

00:51.312 --> 00:53.531
can any of you help me?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.968
CHARITY:
You understand
this does come

00:56.012 --> 00:57.753
as a shock.

00:57.796 --> 01:00.495
We'll need to process,
confer...WOMAN: Wait.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.671
That won't be necessary.

01:02.714 --> 01:03.846
Anakalypto.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.675
Priyanka, the cloaking spell.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.156
Makes it impossible to
carry on a conversation.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.332
I'll risk it. Macy,

01:11.375 --> 01:13.334
Elder Priyanka Bari.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.292
I've been heading up
the investigation

01:15.336 --> 01:16.641
into your mother's death.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.469
And I also have
expertise

01:18.513 --> 01:20.341
in demon-witch interminglings.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.473
It's really great
to meet you, Elder Bari.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.084
Have you been experiencing

01:24.127 --> 01:27.565
any strange visions, dreams?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.132
No.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.916
No, not that I can recall.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.136
It's still early, then.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.225
I'd like to examine you
as soon as possible.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.270
Sorry.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.926
Oh, I have to get home.
Like, real home.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.798
Maggie says it's urgent.

01:42.841 --> 01:43.799
Harry's summoning me as well.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.409
Come. Let's go.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.720
Hey.Hey.

01:51.763 --> 01:55.158
Macy, Charity, I'm glad
you could come so quickly,

01:55.202 --> 01:56.942
as this is...
Trèsbizarre.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.162
I mean, there is a temple
under our house

01:59.206 --> 02:00.685
without any doors.
Yes.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.166
It appears it can only be
accessed through magical means.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.733
Orbing, portals...

02:04.776 --> 02:07.518
Accidental phase shifting
during mind-blowing sex.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.303
That's how Parker
and I found it.

02:09.346 --> 02:13.176
Yes.
Anyway...

02:13.220 --> 02:15.831
as this place has seemingly
appeared here overnight,

02:15.874 --> 02:17.354
I believe it may be

02:17.398 --> 02:19.051
a Vortex Viribus.A Vortex Viribus.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.227
Yes, I think you're right.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.184
And they magically geek out

02:21.228 --> 02:23.360
in three, two, one...

02:23.404 --> 02:25.275
Now, theoretically,
a Vortex Viribus is

02:25.319 --> 02:27.321
a locus of immense power.

02:27.364 --> 02:30.367
They can be used to amplify
an aspect of a witch

02:30.411 --> 02:32.587
or a magical being;
a-a power.

02:32.630 --> 02:33.979
Or an attribute, supercharging

02:34.023 --> 02:35.198
and accelerating it
exponentially.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.505
CHARITY: Yes, exactly.HARRY: So, of course,

02:37.548 --> 02:38.984
we mustn't touch anything here.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.856
CHARITY:
No.

02:40.899 --> 02:43.424
Well, I just--
I just hope that, um,

02:43.467 --> 02:46.296
this has nothing to do
with my-my demon issue.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.645
CHARITY:
I don't know.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.300
But don't worry, we will
figure it out together.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.606
HARRY:
Yes.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.085
Speaking of together,
where's Mel?

02:53.129 --> 02:55.392
Oh, she hasn't answered

02:55.436 --> 02:56.828
any of my texts
or my calls.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.830
She's probably with--

02:58.874 --> 03:00.876
She's with Jada.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.400
She has completely

03:03.444 --> 03:04.662
lost sight of her mission.

03:04.706 --> 03:08.231
I-- I warned her
that the Sarcana

03:08.275 --> 03:10.364
could seduce her, and that is
exactly what's happened.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.540
This is déjà vu
all over again.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.238
Mel won't end up
like Fiona.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.414
CHARITY:
Well...

03:17.458 --> 03:20.156
let's just hope that
Mel returns safely,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.158
and that Jada and the
Sarcana haven't put her

03:22.202 --> 03:24.552
in any unnecessary danger.

03:29.818 --> 03:32.255
MEL: You know, when you
mentioned a romantic

03:32.299 --> 03:35.432
orb-away to Ireland, I wasn't
anticipating machetes.

03:35.476 --> 03:38.479
You saying Neolithic Druidic
ruins don't do it for you, Vera?

03:43.179 --> 03:45.355
I think this is it.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.401
Where we'll find the relic that
should restore the Keeper

03:47.444 --> 03:49.229
to full strength, and then...

03:49.272 --> 03:51.535
MEL:
Complete the sacred mission that
you still won't tell me about.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.798
Jada, I'm halfway
across the world.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.365
I need to know
what I'm doing here,

03:55.409 --> 03:57.106
or I won't take another
step in retrieving

03:57.149 --> 03:58.412
this whateverstone.

03:58.455 --> 04:02.503
Mel, I just... can't.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.462
Unless...

04:05.506 --> 04:07.899
Unless what?

04:07.943 --> 04:10.337
I'd need you to swear
not to tell anyone,

04:10.380 --> 04:12.991
not even your sisters, and
I know that's not gonna happen.

04:13.035 --> 04:18.345
If you can promise me
my sisters won't get hurt,

04:18.388 --> 04:19.911
I can keep the secret.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.437
That's a deal I can make.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.877
So, the Keeper's real name...

04:28.920 --> 04:30.444
it's Fiona Callahan.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.360
Fiona?

04:33.403 --> 04:36.580
As in Charity's sister?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.452
But she's dead.A cover story.

04:38.495 --> 04:41.411
Harry and Charity
don't even know the truth.

04:41.455 --> 04:44.893
When I told you we released
the Keeper from Tartarus

04:44.936 --> 04:47.330
because the Elders sent
her there years ago,

04:47.374 --> 04:49.506
that was Fiona.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.422
But why would the Elders
do that to her?

04:52.466 --> 04:55.643
Fiona was born to be the Keeper
of the Sacred Flame.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.472
It's an ancient
primordial power source,

04:58.515 --> 05:00.604
where magic actually
comes from.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.519
So when she started
cozying up to the Sarcana,

05:02.563 --> 05:06.523
the Elders decided she
needed to be destroyed.

05:06.567 --> 05:11.354
But as it turns out,
the Keeper is immortal.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.443
So they banished her to rot
in Hell's Prison

05:13.487 --> 05:14.792
for all of eternity.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.359
Oh, my God.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.969
Harry, he's been
grieving her death,

05:18.013 --> 05:19.406
feeling responsible
all of these years.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.537
Mel?

05:20.581 --> 05:22.365
If she knew what
the Elders did to her,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.628
she'd realize...Mel, watch out.

05:26.674 --> 05:30.373
Jada, what are these things?
I can't freeze them.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.424
Oh, God, I can't reach it.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.561
Hold on.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.537
JADA:
The Sirona-Stone.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.671
With it, we can
finally heal Fiona.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.719
Mel, you care to do the honors?

06:24.601 --> 06:26.603
MAGGIE:
I just-- I don't like Jada.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.692
She's a bad influence.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.477
Just to play devil's advocate,
though I know

06:30.520 --> 06:32.348
that is a bold choice
on my part,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.872
Mel has been pretty cool
about us dating.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.874
Maybe cut her some slack?

06:36.918 --> 06:39.007
You are different.
You've proven yourself.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.488
You don't know the
first thing about Jada.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.490
There's my resurrected rushee.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.013
I am so, so, so glad

06:45.056 --> 06:46.493
you decided to
do Spring Rush.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.364
And it is so sweet of you

06:48.408 --> 06:50.584
to walk her to registration, P.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.586
Does this mean you guys
are offish back together?

06:52.629 --> 06:54.892
Oh, define "offish."Oh, you know.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.459
Kind of.Oh, please,

06:56.503 --> 06:57.721
I am so over it.

06:57.765 --> 07:00.985
And I'm now your
biggest shipper. Toot, toot.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.465
Uh, great.
That's good.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.901
Well, I got to get to class.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.687
I'll see you both later.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.471
Yeah.
Okay.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.039
Okay.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.302
So, you can help
the newbies out,

07:13.345 --> 07:15.086
which might help with
the other Kappas.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.915
'Cause a few of them aren't
exactly living for the idea

07:17.959 --> 07:20.352
of you coming back.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.050
Okay, have so much fun.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.139
Bye.
Okay, thanks.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
Hi.
Hi.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.013
Uh, is this where you
sign up to rush Kappa?

07:29.057 --> 07:31.494
Yeah, yeah, it is.
I'm-I'm Maggie.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.235
I-I rushed last fall,
and I am again.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.715
It's a long story.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.020
Uh, Daphne.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.369
Oh.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.459
So, you know them?

07:39.502 --> 07:41.809
Um, are they, like,
super judgy?

07:41.852 --> 07:45.073
If they were, do you think
I'd be rushing all over again?

07:46.509 --> 07:48.555
Come on, I'll show you
the ropes.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.517
Well, here we are.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.259
Oh, damn, I didn't realize
we were gone for so long.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.043
What am I gonna
tell my sisters?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.697
Mel, you promised.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.134
I know, it's just...They'd tell Harry,

08:03.178 --> 08:04.484
and he'd tell Charity.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.793
Can I trust you with this?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.752
You can trust me.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.452
Okay.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.500
Thanks again...

08:20.543 --> 08:24.678
for, you know... saving my life.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.298
MAGGIE: Oh, good.

08:36.341 --> 08:39.170
You're alive. 'Cause I
am going to kill you.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.607
Maggie, I'm sorry.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.173
You've been unreachable
for over a day.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.566
Do you know how
worried we were?

08:43.610 --> 08:45.046
How worried I was?

08:45.089 --> 08:46.961
I was with Jada, and there
wasn't exactly cell reception.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.572
You cannot just disappear
with a girl we can't trust, Mel.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.574
I can trust her,
and it's not for you to judge

08:51.618 --> 08:53.054
what I do with my girlfriend.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.056
Your girlfriend is
a rogue terrorist witch.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.711
I can feel you pulling away.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.669
You're being oversensitive.I'm not.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.367
Mel, with my powers,
all I do every day

09:02.411 --> 09:03.717
is see everyone else's side.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.197
Could you please try
to see mine for once?

09:06.241 --> 09:07.677
You are not trying
to see my side.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.723
Fine.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.116
MEL:
She's being such a baby.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.641
How could you think that?

09:14.684 --> 09:16.599
Can't you see
I am scared for you?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.862
You can't get mad at me
for feeling something.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.690
And if you're too
sensitive to handle it,

09:20.734 --> 09:22.344
then stay out of my head.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.216
Whatever. I have to get up
early for Kappa Rush Brunch.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.088
You're rushing?
Yeah.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.219
I am.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.220
I just, I thought...

09:29.264 --> 09:30.439
What?

09:30.482 --> 09:32.093
Say it.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.574
Tell me how you're feeling, Mel,
and I'll try not to be a baby.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.533
I thought, after all
that we've been through,

09:37.577 --> 09:40.492
Kappa would seem superficial
and not worth your time.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.800
Wow.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.150
Now who's judging?
You don't get me,

09:46.194 --> 09:47.804
and maybe you never will.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.604
MAN:
Who-who are you?

10:04.647 --> 10:06.736
Who are you?

10:08.869 --> 10:11.001
What do you want?!

10:11.045 --> 10:13.264
No. No, no, no!

10:34.503 --> 10:36.113
Who are you?
Who are you? No!

10:49.736 --> 10:51.476
What the...?

10:55.263 --> 10:57.265
What the hell am I wearing?

10:59.006 --> 11:00.529
In Maggie's room?

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
Very funny. I'm not sure how
you got me into your bedroom

11:02.618 --> 11:04.664
or your ratty...

11:04.707 --> 11:06.230
You.
Why...

11:06.274 --> 11:07.275
are you...You're...

11:07.318 --> 11:08.711
BOTH:
Me.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.280
What the...?
I'm you.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.021
BOTH:
Harry!

11:14.064 --> 11:16.327
What is happening?

11:16.371 --> 11:17.851
This is so freaky.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.722
Harry, what demon
could have done this?

11:19.766 --> 11:21.332
Breathe, everyone
remain calm.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.812
There must be a
logical explanation.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.728
Or at least a metaphysical one.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.338
Wait, freaky.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.905
I had Chinese food
last night; could it be

11:28.949 --> 11:30.864
the fortune cookie like
in that Lindsay Lohan movie?

11:30.907 --> 11:32.779
You mean the
Jodie Foster movie.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.476
The original's so much
better than the reboot.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.870
Now, Maggie.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.610
Did you, by any
chance, touch anything

11:38.654 --> 11:40.482
in the Vortex Viribus
under the house?

11:40.525 --> 11:42.919
The what under the what?Just one of those big things

11:42.963 --> 11:44.704
you missed while
you were off the grid.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.227
HARRY:
Maggie Vera.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.578
Just one...

11:49.621 --> 11:51.928
eerie...
glowing rune? Well,

11:51.972 --> 11:54.104
apparently, one touch is enough

11:54.148 --> 11:56.628
to temporarily amplify
your powers.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.500
After all, what is empathy

11:58.543 --> 12:00.763
if not walking
in another woman's shoes?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.765
Hmm.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.813
"A soul transference
between two witches

12:06.856 --> 12:08.379
"may occur when
an empath's powers

12:08.423 --> 12:09.946
accelerate beyond her control."

12:09.990 --> 12:12.949
Yep, this is
totally your fault.Well, how do we fix it?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.821
All right. Okay.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.823
"An empath who has
mastered her power

12:16.866 --> 12:18.955
can easily reverse
this transference."

12:18.999 --> 12:21.784
I just have
to focus my powers.Good.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.484
MAGGIE: Switch us back, switch us back.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.095
Oh, why isn't it working?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.097
Because we have
each other's powers.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.620
They stayed in
our bodies.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.143
Oh, this is a sticky wicket.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.972
It took months for you both
to master your abilities.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.844
This could
take some time to undo.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.934
I don't have time.
I have Kappa Rush Brunch
in a few hours.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.674
Oh, yeah. Because
that's important.

12:42.718 --> 12:43.806
Hi.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.549
Something really freaky
is going on.

12:47.592 --> 12:48.985
Tell us about it.We know.
Yes, quite.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.901
You already know I may have
demoned out in my sleep

12:51.945 --> 12:53.990
and turned some guy
on the quad into a statue?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.383
Hmm?

12:55.426 --> 12:59.256
Or you're talking about
a different freaky thing?

13:00.692 --> 13:03.695
Note the fearful stance,
looking away.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.915
The artist is clearly
depicting how weak men

13:05.959 --> 13:08.352
fear powerful women.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.790
He's cowering
in the face of progress.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.400
They think it's some
Banksy art piece.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.315
And not someone I may have
murdered last night.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
You couldn't have done this.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.535
There's no way.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.233
I don't know, Mel.
I mean, Maggie.

13:19.276 --> 13:20.756
I just...

13:20.800 --> 13:22.323
I didn't just see it
in my dream,

13:22.366 --> 13:23.977
I really felt it.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.763
I was overcome with rage
and a-a thirst for vengeance.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.200
I touched a rune
in that Vortex, too.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.854
What if it accelerated
my demon side

13:31.898 --> 13:33.813
the same way it supercharged
Maggie's power?

13:33.856 --> 13:36.250
Or perhaps it amplified
a latent ability

13:36.293 --> 13:37.817
inherited from
your mother.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.472
Your dream could have
been a premonition.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.866
Meanwhile, Maggie, can
you use Mel's powers

13:43.910 --> 13:45.781
to freeze these
onlookers?

13:45.825 --> 13:46.826
We should get
a sample

13:46.869 --> 13:48.131
of the stone for
Macy to analyze.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.786
Um, sure.
Like, how hard can it be?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.049
I just, like,
raise a hand, right?

13:58.489 --> 14:01.057
Not so easy, is it?
Also, when I do it,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.667
I try not to be so obvious.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.974
Whatever, I don't need
your powers to handle this.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.410
Oh, my God.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.326
Did you guys hear about
the other art installation

14:09.370 --> 14:10.937
in the Engineering quad?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.808
It's a giant purple penis.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.245
Can you even? Go.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.030
Go see it, go.

14:20.816 --> 14:21.948
HARRY: Macy, take a
look at that stone.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.514
I'll swing by my place

14:23.558 --> 14:26.039
and pull any references
on petrifying demons.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.911
I'll check back later.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.000
I'll get to this when
I've met with Elder Bari.
She's the one helping me.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.523
And if there's any chance

14:32.567 --> 14:35.918
I did this,
I need all the help I can get.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.921
Wait, you can't tell an
Elder about this dream.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.314
Yes, I can and I will.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.751
She specifically asked me
about any strange dreams.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.187
What if she decides
you're too dangerous?

14:44.231 --> 14:45.362
Don't you remember what

14:45.406 --> 14:46.929
the Elders wanted
to do to Angela Wu?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.626
Yes, I do remember.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.541
But I'm not getting
anywhere with Dr. Julia

14:50.585 --> 14:51.934
and Galvin's been
unreachable for days.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.544
I just-- I have to do something.

14:53.588 --> 14:54.981
And Elder Bari,
Charity,

14:55.024 --> 14:56.591
they want to help,
they wouldn't.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.071
Of course they would.
Mel.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.594
The Elders have our back

14:59.637 --> 15:02.031
even if Jada
claims they don't.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.426
Whatever.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.210
I'm gonna go to
the Student Union.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.038
See if anyone's been
reported missing.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.736
Mel, wait.

15:11.780 --> 15:12.999
If you see any Kappas,

15:13.042 --> 15:14.391
please do not screw up
my rush bid.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.827
I already
missed Rush Brunch.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.264
Fine.

15:17.307 --> 15:19.962
But you have to take
my shift at The Haunt.Deal.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.051
And please, no cheeseburgers.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.966
My body's still vegan-ish.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.228
Remember?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.056
MACY: Do you think Mel could be right

15:27.100 --> 15:28.449
about the Elders?

15:28.492 --> 15:30.059
Or do I just find what she says

15:30.103 --> 15:31.495
more convincing
coming out of your mouth?

15:31.539 --> 15:32.844
No way.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.064
She's blindly following Jada.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.066
I feel like...

15:37.110 --> 15:38.938
I feel like she's pulling
away from me again.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.549
Like she did when Mom died.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.118
Oh, crap.
We forgot to switch phones.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.207
I have Mel's.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.078
Which I can unlock

15:49.122 --> 15:50.775
because I have
her thumbprint.

15:50.819 --> 15:53.126
No, no, Maggie.
I don't think you should...

15:53.169 --> 15:54.910
It's Jada.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.216
This is my chance.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.870
I can finally figure out
if Jada can be trusted.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.482
Do you really think
you can pass as Mel

16:01.525 --> 16:02.962
to her own girlfriend?

16:04.050 --> 16:06.835
I've known Mel
for almost 19 years.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.358
I got this.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.838
Okay, go ahead.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.753
But if I were you,
I would change.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.146
Yeah, just...

16:13.189 --> 16:14.974
try for a little
less Maggie.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.280
Yeah.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.720
Hmm.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.081
Is somebody there?

16:38.606 --> 16:40.173
Who are you? Stop.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.479
Oh... Damn.

16:44.264 --> 16:47.397
Maggie Vera,
Greek debauchery awaits you.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.660
Wait, what is going on?

16:49.704 --> 16:51.793
This is ridiculous.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.013
Put me down.Maggie!

16:54.056 --> 16:55.884
This is so absurd.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.842
Blowing off Rush Brunch
was not the look,

16:57.886 --> 17:01.281
but the gods will forgive you
if you pay them proper tribute.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.065
Right, ladies?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.113
Let's do this.I'm in Hell.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.810
This is Hell.

17:08.853 --> 17:13.162
These enchanted needles
probe your body and soul.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.468
They'll help me determine

17:14.511 --> 17:16.905
how far your demonic condition
has progressed.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.472
And then you'll
know how to cure me?

17:18.515 --> 17:20.213
Uh...

17:20.256 --> 17:23.129
Then we'll know what...
course of action to take.

17:23.172 --> 17:26.175
And if I did turn
that guy to stone...

17:28.221 --> 17:30.223
...if I am dangerous,
what will you do?

17:31.137 --> 17:33.095
Macy, it won't come to that.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.144
All done.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.189
We'll leave you to get dressed.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.280
CHARITY:
What is it?

17:44.324 --> 17:47.022
What did you see?I'm not sure yet.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.111
But I do believe the Vortex

17:49.155 --> 17:51.070
has awakened something
within Macy.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.159
Her dream
is proof of that.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.248
Meaning what?

17:55.291 --> 17:58.207
That-that we
can't cure her?
I'm saying

17:58.251 --> 18:00.992
that if I'm correct
about what I saw,

18:01.036 --> 18:02.994
we may not want to.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.072
DAPHNE: Oh, God,
we're going to Phi Delt.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.682
Okay, you can do this.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.162
It's okay.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.294
Hey, are you okay?

18:42.556 --> 18:46.081
I'm Mel-- I mean,
I'm Maggie.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.170
Yeah, we met yesterday.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.563
You said you'd
show me the ropes?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.869
Oh, no. Right.

18:51.913 --> 18:54.307
Yes, um...
and I plan to.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
Because who
better than me

18:55.960 --> 18:58.267
to show you the Kappa
ropes?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.226
DAPHNE:
Is Maggie gay?

19:00.269 --> 19:01.966
I'm suddenly getting a vibe.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.968
MAGGIE: Yeah, I'm just
not feeling like myself.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.362
I could still try
to come in to work,

19:06.406 --> 19:08.321
but I mean, the words
"explosive" and "projectile"

19:08.364 --> 19:10.323
are coming up...

19:10.366 --> 19:12.803
You're right.
I'll just stay home.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.457
Thanks, um...

19:14.501 --> 19:16.285
boss?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.897
Digging the extra
femme look, Vera.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.334
I know, right?

19:21.377 --> 19:24.250
Shouldn't I dress like
this all of the time?

19:29.864 --> 19:31.170
Damn.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.173
Now I get what...

19:34.216 --> 19:36.131
Isee in you.

19:37.306 --> 19:41.223
So... the Sirona-Stone.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.529
It's already
working wonders on Fiona.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.402
Charity's sister?

19:46.446 --> 19:49.666
That's... that's great.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.582
You didn't tell
your sisters about her?

19:52.626 --> 19:54.062
Of course not.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.673
Why would I ever tell my sisters
anything that important?

19:56.717 --> 19:58.588
Good.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.069
Could I see Fiona?

20:02.113 --> 20:03.419
Sure.

20:03.463 --> 20:06.248
Come with me.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.250
HARRY:
Macy, brilliant news.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.253
Two more statues
have just popped up on campus.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.255
That's brilliant?

20:13.299 --> 20:15.344
Well, obviously not
for those petrified,

20:15.388 --> 20:17.216
but it means the demon
is still at large.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.043
And unless you dreamt up
those as well,

20:19.087 --> 20:22.133
you are hereby exonerated
of all wrongdoing.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.832
That is a relief.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.921
But it doesn't
explain how I dreamt up

20:26.964 --> 20:28.879
a demonic crime.Determining which demon

20:28.923 --> 20:31.273
is the actual culprit
may offer some insight.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.144
Right.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.321
Well, here's what I have so far.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.323
The statue sample
is exhibiting

20:37.366 --> 20:39.281
characteristics
of organic matter.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.717
It's not a mineral at all.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.197
So it's a living thing.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.199
Kind of like coral.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.853
Even stranger,

20:45.896 --> 20:48.334
though it seemingly
materialized overnight,

20:48.377 --> 20:52.076
carbon dating puts it roughly
at 2,800 years old.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.296
Wait.That would be what?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.516
800 B.C.?

20:56.559 --> 20:59.345
The dawn of the Greek age
of mythic heroes.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.914
And legendary monsters.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.269
Toga! Toga! Toga!

21:17.101 --> 21:18.973
LUCY: That's right,
toga parties are so old-school

21:19.016 --> 21:20.279
they're chic again.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.629
So what better way to kick off
Spring Rush?

21:22.672 --> 21:26.197
Now, I want to see you all
out there getting your Greek on.

21:26.241 --> 21:29.200
No ditching early,
or there'll be Hades to pay.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.377
Ha.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.774
Hey, are you sure you're...I get it.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.210
You saw it, didn't you?

21:39.254 --> 21:40.603
Saw what?

21:41.648 --> 21:43.345
I can't.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.652
I can't deal with
this right now.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.571
♪ So I suggest you dance before
I hit the power button... ♪

21:51.614 --> 21:54.356
PARKER: My girlfriend
is so smoking hot.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.619
Oh, gross!
I do not consent.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.447
Maggie, what did I...Nope, not Maggie.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.883
It's Mel, in Maggie's body.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.842
Oh, like a little roleplay...

22:01.885 --> 22:03.670
No, you cliché
of a straight white male.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.976
Oh. You really are Mel.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.238
Long story short,

22:07.282 --> 22:08.501
we body-swapped.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.372
So no more neck nuzzles, okay?

22:10.416 --> 22:11.591
LUCY:
There you are.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.549
My favorite ship.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.596
Time to get some wind
in your sails.

22:16.639 --> 22:20.382
Oh, wow.
Uh-huh, yes, girl.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.428
I don't remember her rushing.

22:24.038 --> 22:28.390
Oh, so, Mags, we have a luge
in the shape of Mount Olympus

22:28.434 --> 22:30.349
with your name on it.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.526
Oh, I don't know if I could
slide down a luge in this toga.

22:33.569 --> 22:37.399
Oh, come on, girl, we all know
that you are the luge queen.

22:37.443 --> 22:41.142
Right. Totally. Yeah.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.013
All right, everyone,

22:43.057 --> 22:45.451
step aside, step aside.

22:45.494 --> 22:48.367
ALL :
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

22:51.021 --> 22:52.632
Shot! Shot! Shot!

22:55.635 --> 22:58.377
An ancient evil is on the loose
and the Charmed Ones

22:58.420 --> 22:59.639
aren't even
in their right bodies?

22:59.682 --> 23:01.728
God-- well,
I'm glad you summoned me.

23:01.771 --> 23:05.514
Yeah-- speaking of bodies,
Medusa wasn't always a demon.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.604
This says she was one
of three sorceress sisters.

23:08.648 --> 23:09.823
Yes. Um...

23:09.866 --> 23:11.564
She was a witch.

23:11.607 --> 23:15.306
It's not something we like
to advertise, given...

23:15.350 --> 23:16.395
What she became?

23:17.657 --> 23:20.137
She was a witch.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.531
Is that why I could see
through her eyes in my dream?

23:22.575 --> 23:24.664
That could be the connection.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.666
You could be
kindred spirits,

23:26.709 --> 23:28.276
in a sense.

23:28.319 --> 23:31.453
A monster as my
soul sister.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.586
That's fantastic.

23:33.629 --> 23:37.459
Wait, this says Medusa was raped
by Poseidon in Athena's temple

23:37.503 --> 23:40.462
and turned into a Gorgon
as her punishment.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.509
How is that fair?
She's the victim.

23:43.552 --> 23:44.597
These were harsher,
darker times.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.555
Mm. And-and what
we're dealing with now

23:46.599 --> 23:50.429
is an exceptionally dangerous
being of pure evil.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.344
She must be destroyed.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.521
Huh.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.527
Are you all right?

24:01.570 --> 24:06.619
Medusa was a witch-turned-demon
through no fault of her own.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.447
Harry, she could be me.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.450
Would you vanquish me, too?

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
No, of course not.We'd never let that happen.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.586
All right, we need
to prepare for battle.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.206
Marisol.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.860
Is that you?

24:30.904 --> 24:33.254
No, Fiona. This is her daughter.

24:33.297 --> 24:36.518
Maggie, of course.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.521
Actually, I'm Mel.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.523
Oh.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.699
Yes.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.527
When I heard Marisol's daughter,

24:45.571 --> 24:48.487
a Charmed One no less,
was with the Sarcana,

24:48.530 --> 24:52.055
I knew, I knew
it was meant to be.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.883
How are you?

24:53.927 --> 24:55.537
How are your sisters?

24:55.581 --> 24:58.975
I'm... she... we're good.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.502
What happened to you?

25:03.545 --> 25:05.547
JADA:
A decade in Tartarus

25:05.591 --> 25:06.548
happened to her.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.463
Thanks to the Elders.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.161
And she's been there
the whole time.

25:11.205 --> 25:14.164
Harry and Charity
will be so happy to see you.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.644
JADA: Mel, we've
been over this.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.472
Fiona doesn't want them to know.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.954
Charity's your sister.
She thinks you're dead.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.651
Mel, are you s--
are you serious?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.699
I just don't understand

25:26.742 --> 25:29.571
why you wouldn't want
to see your own sister.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.964
When Charity
joined the Elders,

25:31.007 --> 25:32.618
the very people
who banished me to Tartarus,

25:32.661 --> 25:35.708
she lost the right
to call herself my sister.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.710
I consider her dead to me.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.193
That's your choice to make.

25:43.237 --> 25:46.022
I just think
it's sad.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.638
It's too late
for Charity and me.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.990
But don't make
our same mistakes.

25:57.033 --> 26:01.081
Don't let anyone come
between you and your sisters.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.126
Especially not the Elders.

26:05.433 --> 26:08.088
I'm getting tired.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.662
: I can't believe
the Elders did that to her.

26:16.705 --> 26:21.623
She was a powerful woman
who wasn't under their control.

26:21.667 --> 26:26.628
So they feared her,
and they punished her.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.891
It's what they do.

26:35.768 --> 26:38.727
CHUCK:
I'm guessing she'll be the
first one to take off her toga.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.122
What's so funny?

26:42.165 --> 26:46.300
Are you guys
getting stoned in here?

26:46.343 --> 26:48.128
Mm.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.783
Because I can help with that.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.262
What the...?

27:16.460 --> 27:19.986
♪ I'll find out
what you spend... ♪

27:20.029 --> 27:21.814
How was that?

27:21.857 --> 27:23.206
I just did more shots than
I thought physically possible

27:23.250 --> 27:25.295
and I am barely buzzed.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.254
I really need to talk to Maggie
about her underage body's

27:27.297 --> 27:28.647
high tolerance for alcohol.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.084
My girl can throw down.

27:31.127 --> 27:34.043
She has a high tolerance
for everything.WOMAN: Hi, Mags!

27:34.087 --> 27:36.437
I've been reading minds
all night. It's exhausting.TREVOR: Yo.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.787
Remember that art installation
on the quad?

27:38.831 --> 27:41.442
Two more statues just showed up
in Chuck's room.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.705
This Banksy we got is legit.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.363
What do we have here?

27:49.406 --> 27:53.410
Two victims.
Any common characteristics?

27:53.454 --> 27:54.760
Why is she even here?
We don't need her.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.892
Considering your weakened
swapped state,

27:56.936 --> 27:58.851
I'd say you could use
all the help you can get.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.853
Hmm? Medusa was
decapitated once,

28:00.896 --> 28:02.419
she can be again.

28:02.463 --> 28:05.074
It's the only way
to save these humans

28:05.118 --> 28:07.120
and restore them to flesh.HARRY: Once we find her,

28:07.163 --> 28:08.338
you mustn't look into her eyes.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.471
That's how she petrifies
her victims.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.559
That shield

28:11.602 --> 28:12.647
will block her
power and then...

28:12.691 --> 28:13.909
Off with her head?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.128
MAGGIE:
Macy,

28:15.171 --> 28:16.782
what's the matter?Medusa

28:16.825 --> 28:17.957
used to be a witch.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.350
A witch I am connected to
in some way.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.525
MAGGIE:
Wait,

28:21.569 --> 28:22.613
Medusa was a witch?Yeah.

28:22.657 --> 28:25.355
She had two sisters
and unruly hair.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.445
She was raped, slut-shamed
and turned into a monster.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.665
There's really
no other way?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.972
I'm sorry. No.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.843
What's that?

28:34.887 --> 28:37.411
I bet this is his phone.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.630
Let's see what they were
looking at before the attack.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.460
Revelate.

28:48.248 --> 28:49.336
Oh, my God.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.468
What the hell
is #LollipopGuild?

28:51.512 --> 28:53.079
Okay, so some frat guy

28:53.122 --> 28:56.386
@BrettInTheAct has been
posting pictures of girls...

28:56.430 --> 28:59.041
uh, gilding the lolly.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.869
Typical.PARKER: Brett

29:00.913 --> 29:03.219
is a Phi Delt legacy
and a jackass.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.091
Is he here now?No, I-I haven't
seen him

29:05.134 --> 29:07.746
in a few days actually.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.704
Well, he must be
the first victim.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.358
The statue on the quad.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.316
And if I were a patron demon
of the slut-shamed,

29:13.360 --> 29:14.578
I would also be going after

29:14.622 --> 29:16.363
anybody sharing these posts.

29:16.406 --> 29:19.366
Or anyone who stands by, doing
nothing while it happens.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.541
Which Medusa
might assume,

29:20.584 --> 29:23.283
not unfairly,
is the entire Greek system.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.328
So everyone here may be at risk.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.069
Wait, this is Daphne,
she's rushing Kappa.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.723
MEL: She's here.
I just met her.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.073
She seemed totally freaked out
to be at Phi Delt.

29:31.117 --> 29:33.336
I could feel
how panicked she was.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.860
Could she have summoned Medusa?

29:34.903 --> 29:36.339
It's possible.

29:36.383 --> 29:37.558
We'll need to split up.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.168
Let's start with this Daphne.

29:40.213 --> 29:42.171
Macy, wait.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.303
Don't worry.

29:43.346 --> 29:44.608
You won't have to kill her.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.523
All right?
Take the shield, use it.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.788
Shout if you find the Gorgon.
I will portal to you...

29:51.398 --> 29:53.139
...and do what has to be done.

29:58.579 --> 30:01.147
So I met Fiona.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.714
Yeah. Super busted.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.847
How could you not tell us
that she's still alive?

30:05.891 --> 30:08.328
I'm sorry, but I just
found out myself.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.547
You can't tell
Harry and Charity.

30:10.591 --> 30:13.333
I won't. But only because
it's Fiona's choice, not ours.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.638
MEL:
Macy.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.162
There's Daphne, headed upstairs.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.560
Daphne?

30:26.433 --> 30:27.521
Daphne?

30:27.564 --> 30:29.436
We just want to help.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.004
Daphne, we know
about the statues.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.049
And Medusa.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.535
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

30:41.578 --> 30:44.581
I begged Brett
to take down the pictures,

30:44.625 --> 30:46.627
but he wouldn't.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.978
I was at the fountain outside
the Classics building,

30:50.022 --> 30:53.460
crying into it, thinking about
how much I hated him,

30:53.503 --> 30:56.158
and how I wanted him to pay
for what he did.

30:56.202 --> 30:59.770
And then,
she came to me.

30:59.814 --> 31:03.078
Right out of the water.
I was terrified.

31:03.122 --> 31:06.603
She said they were all to blame.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.736
She said she'd make them pay
for what they'd done.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.392
Daphne, stay here.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.655
Hide.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.356
Macy, lift the shield.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.488
Maggie!Now!

31:26.188 --> 31:28.538
MEL:
Harry!

31:28.582 --> 31:31.411
Oh, no, no, no.

31:38.809 --> 31:42.161
She's hunting them down...

31:42.204 --> 31:43.597
one by one.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.607
Parker.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.174
This can't be happening.

31:55.217 --> 31:58.003
We have to
turn them back.

31:58.046 --> 32:02.355
We will. We will.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.270
Let's find her.

32:19.328 --> 32:23.071
Who's next?

32:23.115 --> 32:25.944
Who wants to see?

32:35.344 --> 32:36.476
Maggie, you're gonna
have to freeze her.

32:36.519 --> 32:38.565
Okay.

32:43.396 --> 32:47.487
We can smell you in
here, little witches.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.749
Don't you want

32:48.792 --> 32:52.100
to see, hmm?

32:55.364 --> 32:57.540
Maggie, now!

33:01.109 --> 33:02.763
I did it.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.205
Macy, Maggie can't
hold her forever.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.603
They're all looking away.

33:16.646 --> 33:19.040
Macy, hurry. I don't...
think I can hold her

33:19.084 --> 33:20.563
much longer.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.044
She doesn't do it
when you look at her.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.567
Macy, you're not
making any sense.

33:24.611 --> 33:27.570
The ones she turned to stone
are the ones who turned away.

33:27.614 --> 33:28.919
She wants to be seen.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.662
Maggie, let her go.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.708
Okay.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.500
Medusa.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.635
I see you.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.819
And I'm not going to turn away.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.779
You were cursed

34:02.823 --> 34:05.608
to cover up the crime
of a powerful man.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.655
So that no one would
ever see your pain.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.222
But I see it.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.530
And I'm so sorry.

34:14.574 --> 34:18.491
Know that you are
not to blame.

34:18.534 --> 34:21.189
And now you can let go.

34:21.233 --> 34:24.758
And you can let go
of all these people, too.

34:24.801 --> 34:28.501
We will do everything
in our power

34:28.544 --> 34:30.503
to right
these wrongs.

34:30.546 --> 34:34.289
Like the ones done to Daphne

34:34.333 --> 34:37.118
and to you...

34:37.162 --> 34:39.468
and to so many others.

35:29.910 --> 35:33.131
So Harry mind-wiped just about
everyone who saw too much.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.610
How's Macy?

35:34.654 --> 35:38.745
Still pretty shaken up.
Charity portaled her home.

35:38.788 --> 35:41.487
LUCY:
Anyways...

35:41.530 --> 35:44.403
I'm sorry if this ruins your
rush bid, but I have to do this.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.144
Wait, what?Lucy.

35:49.756 --> 35:52.193
This guy and a bunch of others
have been slut-shaming girls,

35:52.237 --> 35:54.326
including a
Kappa rushee.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.066
I mean, look,
it's all here.

35:57.242 --> 36:00.636
And...

36:00.680 --> 36:03.117
it sucks if this ruins
my rush bid,

36:03.161 --> 36:04.640
but it needs to be dealt with

36:04.684 --> 36:06.294
because if we don't
do anything,

36:06.338 --> 36:09.167
we're all complicit.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.909
This is disgusting.

36:12.953 --> 36:14.911
I could not agree
with you more, Maggie.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.131
You... couldn't?Chuck,

36:17.175 --> 36:18.915
you and all your

36:18.959 --> 36:21.135
nasty bros
are on notice.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.704
This is so getting reported,
even if you are a Phi Delt.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.227
Oh, he is not
in Phi Delt anymore.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.404
Brett, Chuck and anyone else
involved in this is out.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.972
CHUCK: Whatever.
Let's go, man.

36:35.323 --> 36:38.326
Aw, great job, babe.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.113
MEL: I still can't believe you
kissed Parker with my lips.

36:43.157 --> 36:44.637
It's a total violation.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.248
I just got...
caught up in the moment.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.250
I guess I'll let it go.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.687
I mean, it's not like
you kissed Jada.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.689
You kissed Jada.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.214
Technically,
she kissed me first.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.958
But I do want to apologize

37:02.002 --> 37:04.004
for misjudging her

37:04.047 --> 37:06.659
and the Sarcana.

37:06.702 --> 37:11.011
And I'm sorry for dismissing
your totally valid emotions.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.883
I don't know
how you do it.

37:13.927 --> 37:16.669
I am exhausted from reading
all those thoughts.

37:16.712 --> 37:20.020
You are so much stronger
than I ever knew.

37:22.065 --> 37:25.330
Okay, maybe I was
a little oversensitive.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.593
It's just,
you have this

37:27.636 --> 37:30.596
whole new life with Jada,

37:30.639 --> 37:32.598
and I think...

37:32.641 --> 37:34.121
I just missed you.

37:35.427 --> 37:37.864
Aw.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.303
Wait.

37:42.347 --> 37:45.393
I can't hear your thoughts
anymore, which means...

37:45.437 --> 37:48.135
You've got control of my powers?

37:48.178 --> 37:50.790
Which means maybe
we can switch back.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.618
Okay.

38:01.627 --> 38:04.107
Oh! Yes!
Oh, my God.
These are my boobs.

38:04.151 --> 38:05.413
Oh, my God.Oh, thank God.

38:05.457 --> 38:08.111
Oh, these shoes.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.896
Harry, guess which
witches no longer

38:09.939 --> 38:11.724
have a case
of the switches?HARRY: Well done.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.508
I knew you two
would get it sorted out.

38:13.552 --> 38:16.250
How's Macy?

38:18.296 --> 38:19.558
Better, I think.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.560
She's with Charity now.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.264
Hey.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.788
Made by Harry,
not me.

38:32.832 --> 38:36.052
Thank you.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.838
♪ Heart lying in my hands...

38:38.881 --> 38:41.406
Macy...

38:41.449 --> 38:45.148
that was a brave
thing you did

38:45.192 --> 38:47.368
with Medusa.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.501
It was also

38:49.544 --> 38:51.503
highly unorthodox.

38:51.546 --> 38:55.202
I don't know how,

38:55.245 --> 38:56.682
but I knew
it would work.

38:58.597 --> 39:02.165
Charity, what if our
entire concept of demons,

39:02.209 --> 39:04.211
of good and evil,
what if it's all wrong?

39:04.254 --> 39:06.213
Maybe the demon
part of me

39:06.256 --> 39:08.868
doesn't need to be removed.
What if I could learn

39:08.911 --> 39:11.436
to control it and
use it for good?

39:11.479 --> 39:15.396
It helped me
understand Medusa.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.920
I think it could help us
with other demons.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.664
Well, that-that goes against

39:22.708 --> 39:25.537
everything I have
ever been taught.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.713
Yeah...

39:27.756 --> 39:29.323
But...

39:32.587 --> 39:35.982
I've begun to see things
differently.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.332
♪ Don't let this be the end...

39:44.512 --> 39:46.514
What is it?
Is everything okay?

39:46.558 --> 39:48.081
It's Elder Bari.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.649
She has your results
and is on her way.

39:50.692 --> 39:53.216
♪ Don't let this be the end...

39:53.260 --> 39:55.741
She wants to speak
with you alone.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.398
Okay.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.271
So what were your findings?

40:04.314 --> 40:06.273
Can I be cured?

40:06.316 --> 40:08.101
Of that,
I am not sure.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.364
But my examination
has confirmed

40:10.408 --> 40:12.540
the demon in you
has provided you

40:12.584 --> 40:14.368
with an extraordinary gift.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.589
Uh, what kind of gift?

40:17.632 --> 40:20.505
It was awakened
by the Vortex.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.463
It is what allowed you
to see through

40:22.507 --> 40:26.336
Medusa's eyes,
to truly understand her.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.382
We call it

40:28.426 --> 40:30.253
the Evil Sight.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.213
That doesn't sound like a gift.

40:33.256 --> 40:34.475
Oh, but it is.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.259
Through this power,

40:36.303 --> 40:38.479
you can see through
the eyes of evil.

40:38.523 --> 40:42.004
You can view evil acts,
even in the past.

40:42.048 --> 40:46.356
Macy, don't you see?

40:46.400 --> 40:49.142
We can use it to find
your mother's murderer

40:49.185 --> 40:51.013
and the killer
of the other Elders.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.451
Your latent power

40:53.494 --> 40:55.540
could be the key.

40:55.583 --> 40:58.934
Oh-- Pl-- Wait,
I-I don't know if I'm ready

40:58.978 --> 41:02.198
for that.

41:02.242 --> 41:05.550
Of course, this ability
is hidden deep within you.

41:05.593 --> 41:08.466
You only tapped into it
because of the Vortex.

41:08.509 --> 41:11.469
To see what I need you to see,

41:11.512 --> 41:14.384
you'll need a little...
booster shot.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.143
What have I done?

41:34.187 --> 41:36.711
Macy?

41:36.755 --> 41:38.539
What is it?

41:38.583 --> 41:40.802
It's Charity.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.414
Charity killed our mother.
