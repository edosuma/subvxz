FORBES:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:59.130 --> 35:00.496
ED:
HE'S NOT GIVING UP.
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.365
<i> SECONDS COUNT.</i>
<i> WE GOTTA MOVE FAST.</i>

35:02.367 --> 35:03.366
OKAY, WHAT CAN I DO?

35:03.368 --> 35:04.568
ED:
GIVE US A WAY IN.

35:04.569 --> 35:05.769
NOW I HEARD GRAY'S LIFE
WAS FALLING APART

35:05.771 --> 35:06.770
WHEN HE LEFT THE ARMY.

35:06.772 --> 35:07.771
<i> WHAT HAPPENED?</i>

35:07.773 --> 35:08.772
IT WAS HIS WIFE.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.240
SHE LEFT HIM?

35:10.242 --> 35:11.608
SHE WAS PREGNANT
WITH THEIR FIRST KID.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.610
<i> HE WAS SO HAPPY.</i>
<i> IT WAS GREAT TO SEE HIM SMILE.</i>

35:13.612 --> 35:14.611
<i> WE WERE SUPPOSED</i>
<i> TO GET A LEAVE, </i>

35:14.613 --> 35:15.779
<i> BUT THEN WE GOT EXTENDED.</i>

35:15.781 --> 35:17.214
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.715
SHE FELL.
SHE HIT HER HEAD.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.217
<i> NOBODY THOUGHT ANYTHING</i>
<i> WAS WRONG,</i>

35:20.218 --> 35:21.718
<i> BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY</i>
<i> THEY FOUND HER.</i>

35:21.720 --> 35:23.186
<i> SHE DIED IN HER SLEEP,</i>

35:23.187 --> 35:24.653
<i> SOME SORT OF RUPTURE</i>
<i> IN HER BRAIN.</i>

35:24.656 --> 35:26.256
THE BABY DIED TOO.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.758
<i> HE FELT THAT IF HE'D-</i>

35:27.759 --> 35:29.259
IF HE'D HAVE BEEN THERE,
HE COULD'VE FOUND HER,

35:29.261 --> 35:31.461
SAVED HER LIFE.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.896
ED: SAM, YOU GET THAT?
SAM: YEAH.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.631
PARKER:
HE FEELS LIKE HE CAN'T FAIL
AT HIS MISSION.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.649
<i> WITHOUT IT...</i>

35:35.650 --> 35:36.666
HE'D HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT HIS PAST,

35:36.668 --> 35:38.835
ALL THE PEOPLE HE'S LOST.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.470
SERGEANT GRAY,
YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS

35:40.472 --> 35:42.239
<i> FOR ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN</i>
<i> WHO NEED HELP,</i>

35:42.241 --> 35:44.307
<i> BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THEM.</i>

35:44.309 --> 35:46.176
IT'S ABOUT YOU, TOO.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.281
WHEN I WAS A KID,
MY LITTLE SISTER WAS KILLED

35:51.283 --> 35:52.816
IN AN ACCIDENT.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.652
I WAS THERE,
I SAW IT HAPPEN.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.721
RIPPED A HOLE
IN THE MIDDLE OF MY LIFE,

35:57.723 --> 35:59.456
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I COULD
TALK ABOUT IT AT HOME.

35:59.458 --> 36:02.926
<i> MY DAD'S A GENERAL,</i>
<i> MY MOM'S A GOOD ARMY WIFE.</i>

36:02.928 --> 36:04.561
THE ORDERS FROM THE TOP
OF MY FAMILY

36:04.563 --> 36:07.364
WERE TO DEAL WITH IT
AND MOVE ON.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.868
<i> SO MY DAD DOVE INTO HIS WORK -</i>
<i> LONGER TOURS, LONGER HOURS.</i>

36:11.870 --> 36:13.236
MY MOM DID
THE CIVILIAN VERSION -

36:13.238 --> 36:14.571
P.T.A., VOLUNTEERING.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.407
AND I THOUGHT...

36:17.409 --> 36:18.875
"HOW CAN THEY GET OVER IT
SO FAST?

36:18.877 --> 36:22.312
HOW CAN THEY NOT EVEN
TALK ABOUT HER?"

36:23.482 --> 36:25.582
<i> 'CAUSE IT HURT TOO MUCH.</i>

36:25.584 --> 36:26.616
THEY WERE JUST TRYING
TO DO ANYTHING

36:26.618 --> 36:28.218
BUT SPEND TIME IN THE HOUSE,

36:28.220 --> 36:31.388
ANYTHING BUT BE REMINDED
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.792
<i> IT'S A NOBLE CAUSE</i>
<i> YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR, SERGEANT,</i>

36:35.794 --> 36:37.277
<i> BUT IT ALSO KEEPS YOU</i>

36:37.278 --> 36:38.761
FROM THINKING ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU'VE LOST,

36:38.764 --> 36:42.199
<i> THE PEOPLE </i>
<i> YOU COULDN'T PROTECT.</i>

36:44.803 --> 36:46.870
ALL I CAN PICTURE IS...

36:48.307 --> 36:49.706
MY WIFE, KATHRYN,

36:49.708 --> 36:52.709
ALONE...

36:52.711 --> 36:54.477
LYING THERE,
NO ONE TO HELP HER.

37:02.287 --> 37:04.254
(SHAKY INHALE)

37:04.256 --> 37:06.756
WITHOUT THIS...

37:06.758 --> 37:07.891
WHAT DO I DO?

37:11.697 --> 37:16.233
YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF
AND YOU REMEMBER HER -

37:16.235 --> 37:19.369
NOT FOR THE SOLDIERS,
NOT FOR THEM,

37:19.371 --> 37:20.437
FOR YOU.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.307
