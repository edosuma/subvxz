¶ I take two steps forward ¶

00:03.269 --> 00:05.670
¶ I take two steps back... ¶

00:05.772 --> 00:08.640
Paula Abdul really
knows how to pick a man.

00:08.741 --> 00:11.075
¶ And you know
it ain't fiction ¶

00:11.144 --> 00:12.177
I love her.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.778
She doesn't know
you're alive.

00:13.846 --> 00:15.346
Well, that's going
to change.

00:15.414 --> 00:17.148
I know some people
in high places

00:17.216 --> 00:18.483
who have some friends

00:18.550 --> 00:20.618
who told me
her number's on the Internet.

00:20.653 --> 00:23.255
¶ She makes the bed... ¶

00:23.322 --> 00:26.057
Oh, lord, she ran
into a wall again.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.426
No. She's taking
waltzing lessons.

00:28.494 --> 00:29.995
It is a great way
to exercise.

00:30.062 --> 00:32.597
I'm just having trouble
finding a partner.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.665
Zelda?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.101
I don't plan on being
reduced to dancing

00:36.168 --> 00:39.070
with my sister until
they put us in the home.

00:39.172 --> 00:41.806
I've got to talk to Harvey--
no time for eating.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.108
How about a waltz?

00:43.176 --> 00:45.777
Uh, how about no?

00:45.878 --> 00:47.979
She kissed Josh
last night

00:48.046 --> 00:49.381
and Harvey saw them.

00:49.415 --> 00:52.784
What?! And no one called me
at waltz class to tell me?

00:52.852 --> 00:55.620
¶ We come together
'cause opposites attract ¶

00:55.655 --> 00:57.855
I want that!

00:57.923 --> 01:00.091
¶ It ain't fiction,
just a natural fact... ¶

01:00.159 --> 01:01.359
There.

01:01.427 --> 01:02.560
Great.

01:02.628 --> 01:03.961
A fake talking cat.

01:04.029 --> 01:06.063
Just what we need around here.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.666
So Sabrina kissed Josh,
and Harvey saw them?

01:08.734 --> 01:09.934
Tell me everything.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.269
That's everything.

01:11.337 --> 01:12.536
¶ ...'Cause opposites attract ¶

01:53.145 --> 01:55.747
Hey.
Hey.

01:55.814 --> 01:57.315
Enough small talk.

01:59.418 --> 02:01.219
Listen, Harvey...

02:01.287 --> 02:03.488
I want to explain to you
about that thing

02:03.556 --> 02:05.022
that happened with Josh.

02:05.090 --> 02:07.258
By "thing," you mean
the kiss, right?

02:07.325 --> 02:09.227
Let's not argue
over semantics.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.463
Look, I didn't plan
to kiss him.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.864
But you looked like
you enjoyed it.

02:12.932 --> 02:17.502
"Enjoyed"? Well, now we're
getting into semantics again.

02:17.569 --> 02:20.438
PAULA ABDUL:
Hi. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

02:20.506 --> 02:22.373
If this is that weird guy,
Salem,

02:22.441 --> 02:24.008
stop weeping into my phone.

02:24.076 --> 02:25.509
(sobbing)

02:25.577 --> 02:28.513
All right,
when a woman's avoiding you

02:28.581 --> 02:30.682
a man has to be a man

02:30.750 --> 02:35.119
and has to do the manly thing:
pretend to be kidnapped.

02:35.187 --> 02:36.454
(door slamming)

02:36.522 --> 02:38.590
We figured you'd
be home for lunch.

02:38.724 --> 02:40.659
So how did things
go with Harvey?

02:40.726 --> 02:42.193
He's not speaking
to me.

02:42.261 --> 02:44.496
The Josh kiss was
that good, huh?

02:44.563 --> 02:45.830
I don't know what to do.

02:45.898 --> 02:48.165
I mean, I like Harvey
and I don't want to lose him

02:48.233 --> 02:49.567
but I like Josh, too.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.836
I always say, "don't take
your foot off the dock

02:51.904 --> 02:54.205
until the other one is securely
on the ship."

02:54.273 --> 02:55.240
What?
What?

02:55.308 --> 02:57.008
Until you're sure
Josh is interested

02:57.076 --> 02:58.476
keep one foot on Harvey.

02:58.543 --> 03:00.678
Hilda, that's dishonest.

03:00.746 --> 03:02.147
Really? It sounds
kind of perfect.

03:02.214 --> 03:03.247
You know you
shouldn't

03:03.315 --> 03:04.381
treat people like that.

03:04.449 --> 03:06.017
Put yourself in Harvey's place.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.285
Watch it. This spell
is never pretty.

03:08.353 --> 03:11.189
Of empathy, this girl
has very few traces.

03:11.257 --> 03:14.391
Allow Sabrina and Harvey
to trade places.

03:15.594 --> 03:16.895
Harvey!

03:16.962 --> 03:18.295
Oh, hey,
Sabrina.

03:18.363 --> 03:20.064
This is my girlfriend, Sarah.

03:20.131 --> 03:21.932
What?! But I'm your girlfriend.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.234
<i>Were,</i> till I figured out

03:23.302 --> 03:26.037
whether things were going
to work out with Sarah.

03:26.105 --> 03:27.338
They are.

03:27.406 --> 03:28.673
Okay, upsetting and creepy.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.610
In your heart

03:32.678 --> 03:35.513
you know that honesty
is the right way to go.

03:35.581 --> 03:38.816
Fine. It's a lot more fun
talking to Aunt Hilda.

03:38.884 --> 03:40.784
Harvey, I have to be
honest with you.

03:40.852 --> 03:43.355
Oh, great. That's what
Coach says right before,

03:43.422 --> 03:45.457
"Your best effort
isn't good enough."

03:45.524 --> 03:46.724
I want to be your girlfriend

03:46.792 --> 03:48.125
but I have feelings
for Josh, too

03:48.193 --> 03:49.761
and I don't want
to string you along,

03:49.829 --> 03:52.497
unless, of course, that's
something you're interested in.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.566
You know, I've been
second string in football,

03:55.634 --> 03:58.103
basketball, even badminton.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.804
I don't want to be
second string with you.

04:00.872 --> 04:03.375
Harvey!

04:03.442 --> 04:05.910
Hey, I hope you
and Josh are happy.

04:05.977 --> 04:09.046
¶ ¶

04:33.839 --> 04:35.639
(music fades)

04:37.276 --> 04:39.110
(waltz playing)

04:39.178 --> 04:41.912
I'm so sick of leading.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.480
Oh!

04:43.548 --> 04:46.584
(scoffs)
It's never Fred Astaire.

04:46.652 --> 04:49.154
SALEM:
<i>My kidnapping plan is underway.</i>

04:49.221 --> 04:52.257
I haven't called Paula Abdul
in 15 whole minutes.

04:52.324 --> 04:56.460
I'm sure she's in a panic
about my kidnapping.

04:59.798 --> 05:03.401
I love my life!

05:06.638 --> 05:07.938
Can I be honest?

05:08.006 --> 05:09.374
Honesty stinks.

05:09.441 --> 05:11.175
Has Josh said anything
about the kiss?

05:11.243 --> 05:13.078
No, and I gave him my best
"Hi, Josh."

05:13.145 --> 05:14.612
All I got back was a "Hey."

05:14.680 --> 05:16.147
I don't think he likes me.

05:16.214 --> 05:19.283
He kissed you.
That was hours ago.
Maybe he's moved on.

05:19.351 --> 05:22.587
Oh, why did I tell Harvey
that I liked Josh?

05:22.654 --> 05:24.521
But I do like Josh.

05:24.589 --> 05:26.758
I can make him like me.

05:26.825 --> 05:28.293
Hey, Josh.

05:28.427 --> 05:30.661
Can I borrow that
when you're finished?

05:30.729 --> 05:32.630
My textbook on 19th-
century philosophy?

05:32.698 --> 05:34.198
Yeah. I can't
get enough of it.

05:34.266 --> 05:36.567
You can't?
I think your cocoa's
getting cold.

05:36.635 --> 05:37.602
Knock yourself out.

05:37.703 --> 05:39.337
Thanks.

05:39.404 --> 05:40.371
(chuckles)

05:40.439 --> 05:42.273
He hates me.

05:42.341 --> 05:45.209
(yelling in French)

05:47.012 --> 05:48.379
She came in
through the clock.

05:48.447 --> 05:50.381
I have no idea
what she's saying.

05:50.449 --> 05:52.750
Somebody please tell me
what' going on.

05:52.818 --> 05:54.919
Oh, well, I could
have done that.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.589
Um, what is your name?

05:57.656 --> 05:58.589
Marie Curie.

05:58.657 --> 05:59.791
Madame Curie.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.692
The famous scientist?

06:01.760 --> 06:03.061
Oh, this is an honor.

06:03.128 --> 06:04.762
It certainly is.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.497
How do we get
rid of her?

06:06.565 --> 06:07.998
Well, we have to figure out

06:08.067 --> 06:10.268
what caused her
to become lost in time.

06:10.335 --> 06:13.704
Um, Madame, what year
do you think this is?

06:13.772 --> 06:15.239
1899.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.541
1899... let's see.

06:16.609 --> 06:18.076
That was before she won

06:18.143 --> 06:20.778
the Nobel prize
with her husband Pierre.

06:20.846 --> 06:22.146
Pierre! (spits)

06:22.214 --> 06:22.947
We are finished.

06:23.014 --> 06:24.281
He is a worm. (spits)

06:24.349 --> 06:25.950
obviously,
they don't give

06:26.018 --> 06:27.785
the prize for manners.

06:27.853 --> 06:31.790
Hey, I'm actually not
working Saturday night.

06:31.857 --> 06:34.125
Hey, you're not working,
either. Any plans?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.526
No. Not really.

06:35.594 --> 06:37.695
Oh, well, I don't
have any plans, either.

06:37.763 --> 06:38.696
Weird.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.098
So, you like sci-fi
movies, right?

06:41.166 --> 06:43.968
Oh, yeah. If mankind is in peril
and it's in black and white,

06:44.035 --> 06:45.403
I'm there.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.805
They're showing my favorite--
<i>The Blob.</i>

06:47.873 --> 06:49.607
Steven McQueen
and a big tub of goo.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.575
What else do you need
in a movie?

06:51.643 --> 06:53.244
Well, you know, it's playing
at the student union

06:53.312 --> 06:54.913
and, since we're
both not working

06:54.980 --> 06:56.614
and we're both
sci-fi fanatics,

06:56.715 --> 06:57.482
we should go.

06:57.549 --> 06:59.116
What, you mean like a date?

06:59.218 --> 07:00.050
A date?

07:00.118 --> 07:01.618
That never really
crossed my mind

07:01.686 --> 07:02.854
but are you asking?

07:02.955 --> 07:05.556
Look, Sabrina,
I like you a lot

07:05.691 --> 07:07.391
and obviously,
as evidenced

07:07.459 --> 07:09.160
by that little kiss
the other night,

07:09.227 --> 07:10.461
I find you attractive.

07:10.529 --> 07:11.896
So you'll pick me up
at 8:00?

07:11.964 --> 07:13.264
But I'm so much
older than you.

07:13.365 --> 07:14.365
Four years.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.067
I'm glad you
see my point.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.903
I really think it
would be better if
we just stayed friends.

07:20.205 --> 07:22.373
He thinks I'm
"too young" for him.

07:22.441 --> 07:23.608
Did he use air quotes,

07:23.675 --> 07:25.809
or did he really
mean "too young"?

07:25.877 --> 07:28.312
I guess I do come off
my own age.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.348
I saw Harvey jump-start
his car today.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.616
Significance?

07:31.684 --> 07:32.983
We used to do that together.

07:33.051 --> 07:34.385
I was always the negative.

07:34.452 --> 07:35.753
So, what you're saying is,

07:35.821 --> 07:37.822
you'd really rather
be with Harvey.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.223
No, it's not that.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.491
It's just...

07:40.559 --> 07:43.494
I need to make myself
seem more sophisticated.

07:43.562 --> 07:44.528
For Harvey.

07:44.596 --> 07:45.963
No, for Josh.

07:46.031 --> 07:47.598
Okay, now my head hurts.

07:47.666 --> 07:50.234
Sabrina, my many
years on this earth

07:50.302 --> 07:52.836
have taught me
one thing:

07:52.904 --> 07:54.805
You can't control love.

07:54.873 --> 07:55.939
Meanwhile...

07:56.007 --> 07:57.308
I need you to cut some words

07:57.376 --> 07:58.976
out of those magazines for me.

07:59.044 --> 08:01.445
"Kidnapped."

08:01.513 --> 08:02.513
"Million dollars."

08:02.581 --> 08:03.914
What is this for?

08:03.982 --> 08:06.417
Uh... Pictionary?

08:11.423 --> 08:13.324
Hey, peeps! I hear Phi Beta...

08:13.392 --> 08:15.493
Max is having a big party
tonight.

08:15.561 --> 08:16.727
Who's in?

08:16.795 --> 08:18.629
Aren't you in high school?

08:18.697 --> 08:21.265
She's a senior
at Westbridge.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.666
Got to go.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.802
So I signed up
for this waltz class.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.637
It's great exercise and fun.

08:26.705 --> 08:28.372
I just need a partner.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.441
So, what do you say?

08:30.508 --> 08:30.974
No.

08:31.042 --> 08:32.710
Fine.

08:32.778 --> 08:36.212
Oh, by the way,
Tin Tin...

08:36.280 --> 08:37.549
not funny.

08:37.616 --> 08:41.686
Where am I going to
find a dance partner?

08:41.754 --> 08:43.020
My foyer.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.989
Look who came
through the clock.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.457
Pierre Curie.

08:46.525 --> 08:47.792
<i>Hola.</i>

08:47.859 --> 08:48.993
(chuckles)

08:49.060 --> 08:51.061
Obviously,
he's here for Marie.

08:51.129 --> 08:53.931
I'm sure the minute
they see each other,
everything will be fine.

08:53.998 --> 08:55.165
MARIE:
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>

08:55.233 --> 08:56.768
Marie! (spits)

08:56.835 --> 08:58.335
No wonder our
French grandmother

08:58.403 --> 09:00.071
covered her sofas
in plastic.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.508
I don't suppose you waltz.

09:03.575 --> 09:05.676
Oh, well, it's
been years, but...

09:05.743 --> 09:07.044
(waltz playing)

09:07.112 --> 09:08.212
Oh!

09:08.279 --> 09:09.547
You're so good!

09:09.614 --> 09:11.582
And so French.
Oh!

09:11.650 --> 09:13.551
Hilda. Hilda!

09:13.619 --> 09:14.819
Excuse me.

09:14.886 --> 09:16.587
Can we focus?

09:16.655 --> 09:19.089
We have got to get
the Curies back together.

09:19.157 --> 09:20.425
Now, here's the plan.

09:20.492 --> 09:22.627
You find out from Pierre
what attracted him

09:22.694 --> 09:24.928
to Marie, and I'll find out
the same from Marie.

09:24.996 --> 09:26.897
But first, we'll have
to find their confidence.

09:26.965 --> 09:27.965
Well, good point.

09:28.032 --> 09:30.167
And what better way
than by dancing?

09:31.470 --> 09:33.638
(waltz playing)

09:33.706 --> 09:35.873
Okay, the mortal way
of looking older is not working.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.208
So, magic is
the only answer.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.609
Let me.

09:38.676 --> 09:41.412
"Sabrina's down and hurt,
make her old as dirt."

09:43.248 --> 09:46.117
Oh, yeah, Josh will
just sweep me away.

09:48.086 --> 09:49.119
Don't do that again.

09:49.187 --> 09:50.587
I think Josh is
hung up on the fact

09:50.655 --> 09:51.889
that I'm still
in high school

09:51.957 --> 09:53.490
so I just have to
be a little older.

09:53.558 --> 09:55.025
Ooh, this looks
like a good one.

09:55.093 --> 09:56.527
"To enhance your
years, try a potion.

09:56.595 --> 09:58.730
Check out the counter
of notions and lotions."

10:02.033 --> 10:03.033
"Oil of Old Age.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.735
"Apply to your
face and throat

10:04.803 --> 10:06.371
"and you'll age
gracefully."

10:09.908 --> 10:12.076
How do you feel?

10:12.144 --> 10:14.478
Like I'm ready
to backpack
across Europe.

10:14.546 --> 10:17.614
All right! That's
got be really 20s.

10:17.682 --> 10:19.016
So, tell me, Pierre,

10:19.084 --> 10:21.051
what attracted
you to Marie?

10:21.119 --> 10:22.953
Whoo! Tell me later.

10:23.021 --> 10:24.221
(giggles)

10:24.289 --> 10:26.891
Madame... Marie...

10:26.959 --> 10:29.760
what attracted
you to Pierre?

10:29.828 --> 10:32.563
He had a laboratory
and no debts.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.599
Oh. So it was
a love match.

10:39.604 --> 10:40.772
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!

10:40.839 --> 10:41.939
Hello.

10:41.973 --> 10:43.341
May I buy you

10:43.408 --> 10:44.708
a cup of coffee?

10:44.776 --> 10:46.944
Do you think
they sell that here?

10:47.012 --> 10:48.579
Oh, I'm loving this.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.447
I feel so mature,
so confident

10:50.515 --> 10:51.615
and just smooth.

10:51.683 --> 10:53.617
This spell is the best.

10:55.987 --> 10:58.823
Why did I make such a big deal
about four years?

10:58.891 --> 11:01.725
I'm posting that on
my Web site tonight.

11:01.793 --> 11:04.228
Josh at 10:00.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.663
Oh, hi, Josh.

11:05.731 --> 11:06.931
Listen, is it too late

11:06.998 --> 11:09.066
for me to change my mind
about that movie?

11:09.134 --> 11:11.568
No. We can go see <i>The Blot--</i>
I mean, <i>The Blob.</i>

11:11.636 --> 11:15.506
Good. First, dinner.
Then, scary monsters.

11:16.574 --> 11:17.908
Yes!
Yes!

11:18.010 --> 11:19.343
You know, magic does have

11:19.411 --> 11:20.811
a certain sense of whimsy,
doesn't it?

11:20.879 --> 11:22.446
(giggling)

11:22.514 --> 11:23.814
Latte.

11:30.255 --> 11:31.823
Sabrina?

11:31.890 --> 11:34.625
Oh, hello, Harvey, it's
nice to see you again.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.897
Have you looked
in the mirror
lately?

11:43.735 --> 11:44.835
That's weird.

11:44.903 --> 11:45.902
WOMAN:
All right, class,

11:45.970 --> 11:47.437
let's settle down.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.172
Hello, Barbara,
are you available for lunch?

11:51.143 --> 11:53.578
I'm good next Friday.

11:58.249 --> 11:59.784
Sabrina, I need some help.

11:59.851 --> 12:02.053
I've thought that
for years, but
now's not the time.

12:02.121 --> 12:03.620
Josh is waiting.
I just need you

12:03.688 --> 12:05.589
to take a picture of me
with today's newspaper.

12:05.657 --> 12:07.624
Why?
The lawsuit.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.433
High school has really
taken a toll on that girl.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.137
Well, I'll have
the burger and fries.

12:20.205 --> 12:22.773
Do you have
any fish?

12:22.840 --> 12:25.676
Do you have any fish
that isn't breaded
and deep fried?

12:26.278 --> 12:27.678
Just water for me.

12:27.746 --> 12:31.082
Saving room
for the mile-high mudcake?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.216
No.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.451
Listen, Sabrina...

12:33.485 --> 12:35.486
we haven't really talked
about the other night,

12:35.553 --> 12:38.122
and I know I've been
sending mixed signals, but...

12:38.190 --> 12:39.289
I'm glad you
brought it up.

12:39.358 --> 12:40.791
I need to know
your intentions.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.027
Intentions?
It's our first date.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.961
Which is the perfect
time to find out

12:45.029 --> 12:46.964
if this relationship
is going anywhere.
(scoffs)
Well, I don't know.

12:47.031 --> 12:48.932
I mean, we're at different
points in our lives.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.802
I'm thinking
about graduate school,

12:51.870 --> 12:53.804
a career.
And I'm thinking
about kids <i>and</i>
a career.

12:53.871 --> 12:56.807
Mister, I want it all,
but I can't make that
happen with Peter Pan.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.275
Now, I need to
know-- are you

12:58.342 --> 12:59.543
in it for the
long haul?

12:59.611 --> 13:01.345
Screaming babies,
stretch marks,
the works?

13:01.413 --> 13:03.013
That's, uh, a good question

13:03.081 --> 13:06.550
and-and it's going to require
some careful thought,

13:06.618 --> 13:10.655
and I-I should get started
on that thinking right now.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.524
And to think I just threw away

13:13.591 --> 13:15.726
the last three minutes
with that man.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.928
So I discovered that
this blue liquid

13:17.996 --> 13:19.630
can replace
a centrifuge.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.565
Amazing.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.701
Zelda, be my partner.

13:23.769 --> 13:24.869
Really?

13:24.936 --> 13:27.104
But what about Pierre?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.339
Pierre! (spits)

13:28.406 --> 13:31.042
Well, it would
be an honor

13:31.109 --> 13:33.510
to work with one
of the great minds

13:33.578 --> 13:34.812
of all time.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.313
Maybe you shouldn't
go back.

13:36.381 --> 13:39.149
<i>We</i> can win a
Nobel prize.

13:39.217 --> 13:41.151
(fizzling)

13:41.219 --> 13:42.619
I was planning

13:42.688 --> 13:46.056
on refinishing
that floor anyway.

13:46.124 --> 13:49.493
Hilda, dancing with you
is like gliding on air.

13:49.561 --> 13:50.527
Only sweatier.

13:50.595 --> 13:51.929
(laughing):
No!

13:51.996 --> 13:54.097
You're graceful and witty.

13:54.165 --> 13:56.500
I'm sorry, but you're
not going back.

13:56.567 --> 13:57.601
Hi, Sabrina.

13:57.669 --> 13:59.904
This is Pierre.

13:59.971 --> 14:01.605
Are you okay?
You look tired.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.574
Bad night. I think
I'm just going to curl up

14:03.641 --> 14:06.143
with a romance novel
and some Epsom salts.

14:06.211 --> 14:08.179
You, too?

14:09.548 --> 14:10.947
(magical twinkling)

14:13.885 --> 14:15.218
(sneezes)

14:15.286 --> 14:16.520
Wait... Oh.

14:16.588 --> 14:19.957
Never leave the house
without a tissue, dear.

14:20.024 --> 14:22.026
I left my lunch at home.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.026
Wait a minute.

14:23.094 --> 14:25.062
Oh... yup,
I thought so.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.364
Fiber wafers.

14:26.431 --> 14:30.100
Filling and... they
keep things moving.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.436
You're welcome.

14:32.503 --> 14:35.339
These kids today
have no home training.

14:35.406 --> 14:36.706
Oh, Harvey,

14:36.774 --> 14:38.008
stand up straight.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.743
Have you been
getting enough sleep?

14:39.810 --> 14:41.512
Hold still. You
got a little schmutz.

14:41.579 --> 14:43.680
This isn't because
we broke up, is it?

14:43.748 --> 14:44.615
(chuckling):
No, dear.

14:44.682 --> 14:46.817
I need a more
mature man.

14:46.884 --> 14:49.052
So cute.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.354
(ringing)

14:50.421 --> 14:52.023
Hello.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.457
Did you get the photos?

14:53.525 --> 14:55.993
Yes, and the ransom note, too.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.296
See, the problem is
I don't know you,

14:58.363 --> 15:01.165
so I really don't care
who took your cat.

15:01.232 --> 15:02.666
But... see...

15:02.734 --> 15:04.801
the cat is actually...

15:04.869 --> 15:05.769
I don't think

15:05.837 --> 15:07.905
I thought this one through.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.073
Stir that solution;
get me the chloride!

15:10.141 --> 15:11.575
Stop ordering me around.

15:11.643 --> 15:14.545
Besides, you already
spilled it on the floor.

15:14.612 --> 15:17.047
And-and be careful,
because it's...

15:19.051 --> 15:21.518
flammable.

15:21.586 --> 15:24.488
Shouldn't you be
cleaning?

15:25.990 --> 15:28.125
You seem a little
sluggish today.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.793
Why don't
we take a break?

15:29.861 --> 15:31.995
Just until my feet
stop bleeding.

15:32.063 --> 15:33.431
Oh, please.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.099
We're just warming up.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.769
I am beginning
to not like him.

15:38.836 --> 15:40.971
She is destroying my lab,

15:41.039 --> 15:44.040
and I think she
may have done some
damage to my lungs.

15:44.108 --> 15:45.376
Well, whether
they like it or not,

15:45.443 --> 15:47.043
they are going
to sit down and talk.

15:47.111 --> 15:49.780
What about Renee,
Marianne, Michelle?

15:49.847 --> 15:51.148
You dance with them all.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.283
Makes you feel
special, huh?

15:53.351 --> 15:54.951
What about Luc? Jean? Jean-Luc?

15:55.019 --> 15:56.187
<i>Henri?!</i>

15:56.188 --> 15:57.487
You're just jealous
because he is

15:57.555 --> 15:59.590
the scientist
you will never be.
Oh.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.425
Ouch. Your turn.

16:01.492 --> 16:03.160
I am going back to work.

16:03.227 --> 16:04.795
<i>Mais oui.</i>
You go back to work.

16:04.862 --> 16:06.196
That is what you do best--

16:06.264 --> 16:08.865
work, work and more work.

16:08.933 --> 16:11.035
How badly
do we need radium?

16:14.205 --> 16:16.173
Oh, tuck in your shirt, boy;
you're at work.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.208
Oh, excuse me, ma'am
but we've canceled

16:18.276 --> 16:19.609
our early bird
special.

16:19.677 --> 16:21.578
It's me-- Sabrina.

16:21.646 --> 16:22.913
And that's a lovely name.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.049
Would you like me to call
dial-a-ride for you?

16:25.116 --> 16:27.518
You're a real wisenheimer.

16:29.020 --> 16:31.922
All right, look.

16:31.989 --> 16:32.957
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

16:33.024 --> 16:34.224
I mean, you say you like me

16:34.292 --> 16:35.826
and I'm trying to show you
that I'm mature...

16:35.894 --> 16:38.129
(splutters)

16:38.196 --> 16:40.764
You just don't seem interested;
I don't get it.

16:40.832 --> 16:43.033
You are really
scaring me, lady.

16:43.101 --> 16:44.768
And I wore my cutest outfit.

16:46.337 --> 16:47.404
Oh, hi, Harvey.

16:47.471 --> 16:48.806
Hi.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.408
Hey, are you related
to Sabrina Spellman?

16:51.475 --> 16:54.645
Well, suddenly
everyone's a comedian.

16:54.713 --> 16:55.679
I got to get home.

16:55.746 --> 16:57.347
My hammertoe's killing me.

16:57.415 --> 16:58.682
Why don't I help you?

16:58.750 --> 17:00.584
These sidewalks
have "broken hip"

17:00.652 --> 17:02.052
written all over them.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.420
PIERRE:
I am not a mother's boy!

17:03.488 --> 17:05.155
It's our duty to get
them back in time.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.457
We've got to think
of something.

17:06.523 --> 17:07.991
I know.

17:08.059 --> 17:09.792
When he's through arguing,
he's going to want

17:09.861 --> 17:11.528
to dance again,
and I can't take it.

17:11.596 --> 17:12.529
(glass breaking)

17:12.597 --> 17:13.630
What was that?

17:13.698 --> 17:15.766
Maybe she killed him.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.501
It was only
a lamp.
(giggling)

17:18.636 --> 17:19.737
Oh...

17:19.805 --> 17:20.904
My vase.

17:20.972 --> 17:22.039
Whoops.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.873
My little butterfingers.

17:23.941 --> 17:24.907
Butter-body.

17:24.976 --> 17:27.010
I'm so much more
comfortable with you

17:27.078 --> 17:28.411
than that tall blonde.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.813
Hilda-- the
name's Hilda.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.249
Let it go. The freaks
are back together.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.886
I have to get a walker.

17:36.954 --> 17:39.289
This lady said
she lives here.

17:39.357 --> 17:40.457
That's Sabrina's...

17:40.525 --> 17:41.624
grandmother.

17:41.692 --> 17:42.893
I am not.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.662
She also thinks
the war's still on.

17:44.729 --> 17:45.663
Come on, Grammy.

17:45.730 --> 17:48.531
Thanks for bringing
her home.

17:48.599 --> 17:50.834
Well, she reminded me
of Sabrina.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.503
What are you talking about?

17:53.571 --> 17:54.705
I look darn cute.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.841
She can't see
her true reflection.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.877
(shrieks)

17:59.944 --> 18:01.444
How could this happen?

18:01.512 --> 18:03.781
I thought Oil of Old Age
was supposed to be safe.

18:03.848 --> 18:05.615
You're supposed
to use it sparingly,

18:05.683 --> 18:08.052
unless this was the look
you were going for.

18:08.119 --> 18:09.853
Why would you do
such a thing?

18:09.921 --> 18:10.921
I was trying to look older

18:10.989 --> 18:12.789
so that Josh would be
interested in me.

18:12.857 --> 18:14.325
Oh, I've played
that game.

18:14.392 --> 18:16.559
I've changed
myself into
a princess,

18:16.627 --> 18:17.895
a farmer and a wombat.

18:17.963 --> 18:20.297
Believe me, being a
princess was the worst.

18:20.364 --> 18:22.532
Did your age bring you
any wisdom?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.035
Yes, I learned that I can't be
what Josh wants me to be;

18:25.103 --> 18:26.436
I have to be myself.

18:26.504 --> 18:28.739
Although the beds at
the castle were comfy.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.941
If Josh doesn't want you
for who you are,

18:31.008 --> 18:33.410
then he's not
who you're meant to be with.

18:33.478 --> 18:35.178
I never had to work this hard
with Harvey.

18:35.246 --> 18:37.147
We were always
so comfortable together.

18:37.215 --> 18:38.582
And I enjoyed
my steed.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.016
Stop it!

18:40.084 --> 18:41.117
I miss Harvey.

18:41.185 --> 18:43.153
It was nice of him
to walk me home.

18:43.221 --> 18:44.655
He's a nice boy.

18:44.722 --> 18:46.757
Yeah, but he'll never
want to be with me

18:46.824 --> 18:48.125
if I smell like VapoRub.

18:48.193 --> 18:50.060
Your youth isn't
gone forever.

18:52.497 --> 18:54.064
Drink this prune juice.

19:01.039 --> 19:04.274
Do you think it's too late
to cancel that adjustable bed?

19:04.342 --> 19:05.275
Sabrinie...

19:05.343 --> 19:06.644
will you cut
off my ear

19:06.711 --> 19:08.546
and place it
in this envelope?

19:08.613 --> 19:10.380
Gross. What
is your problem?

19:10.448 --> 19:11.682
(weeping):
All right, all right.

19:11.749 --> 19:13.817
It's for Paula Abdul.

19:13.885 --> 19:17.187
I faked my own kidnapping, so
she would pay attention to me.

19:17.255 --> 19:18.689
Does she even know who you are?

19:18.756 --> 19:21.658
Why does everyone think
that's a necessary part of love?

19:21.726 --> 19:23.427
Look, I learned the hard way.

19:23.494 --> 19:25.595
It really <i>is</i> better
to be honest.

19:25.663 --> 19:27.130
Fine, I'll try it your way,

19:27.198 --> 19:30.067
but van Gogh really got
the babes, right?

19:30.134 --> 19:32.769
So, isn't that the weirdest
allergic reaction ever?

19:32.837 --> 19:34.038
You do seem better.

19:34.105 --> 19:35.306
And I have to tell you

19:35.373 --> 19:37.140
that after trying
to like philosophy

19:37.208 --> 19:39.476
and science fiction
and everything else you like,

19:39.544 --> 19:41.445
I decided you were right
to begin with--

19:41.512 --> 19:43.012
we <i>are</i> better off as friends.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.481
Friends.

19:44.549 --> 19:47.217
So, um, maybe sometime,
we can do each other's hair?

19:49.821 --> 19:51.255
Just friends...

19:51.323 --> 19:55.159
with a cute, smart, funny girl.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.561
I'm an idiot.

19:58.863 --> 20:00.296
Hey, have you seen Harvey?

20:00.364 --> 20:02.599
I can't wait to
make up with him.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.334
Uh-oh.

20:04.401 --> 20:06.570
See you at lunch.

20:06.638 --> 20:07.637
All right.

20:09.707 --> 20:12.008
Who was that?

20:12.076 --> 20:13.377
Oh, uh, that's Colette.

20:13.444 --> 20:15.479
We're kind of
seeing each other.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.714
Oh, so you're doing okay.

20:17.782 --> 20:19.183
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

20:20.618 --> 20:21.885
I guess I'll see you around.

20:21.952 --> 20:23.319
Yeah, see you.

20:26.057 --> 20:27.724
Colette.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.359
She doesn't look
French to me.

20:29.427 --> 20:31.328
I've lost
Harvey forever.

20:36.901 --> 20:38.635
Men.

20:43.908 --> 20:45.542
"Dear Paula Abdul...
sorry I lied

20:45.609 --> 20:47.311
"about the free
diamond giveaway

20:47.379 --> 20:49.746
"but thank you
for coming to my house.

20:49.814 --> 20:51.581
"I've been going
around doing things

20:51.649 --> 20:52.850
"to try to impress you,

20:52.917 --> 20:55.585
"but I've decided I just
have to be who I am.

20:55.653 --> 20:58.589
"Hopefully, you will
like that person.

20:58.656 --> 21:00.624
"I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

21:00.692 --> 21:03.293
"but I'm very
high up in the CIA"?

21:03.361 --> 21:06.229
"Very high up"?

21:06.297 --> 21:07.931
Why do you keep
staring at me?

21:09.467 --> 21:10.868
"I can't
meet with you

21:10.935 --> 21:13.003
"because I'm away
on a dangerous mission

21:13.070 --> 21:16.673
but I would like you
to comfort... my cat."

21:16.740 --> 21:17.674
<i>Oh, please,</i>
<i>oh, please,</i>

21:17.742 --> 21:20.511
<i>oh, please.</i>

21:20.578 --> 21:22.178
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...</i>
