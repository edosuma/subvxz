00:00.166 --> 00:02.083
<i>Previously on</i>
Desperate Housewives:

00:02.166 --> 00:03.458
Is anybody here?

00:03.542 --> 00:06.083
There may have been
a breakdown in our care.

00:06.166 --> 00:07.458
You trying to buy us off?

00:07.542 --> 00:09.166
<i>If you're not careful...</i>

00:09.250 --> 00:11.417
There's this place called Camp Hennessy.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.333
I'm not going to any camp
for juvenile delinquents.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.792
You don't have a choice.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.166
<i>...past mistakes...</i>

00:17.250 --> 00:19.083
We pulled it out of Rockwater Lake.

00:19.166 --> 00:21.458
I must have sold
several hundred of these.

00:21.542 --> 00:23.750
I have a list
of customers' names on file.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.792
<i>...will come back to haunt you.</i>

00:25.875 --> 00:29.834
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep your secret, Dad.

00:32.083 --> 00:36.250
<i>There were many things</i>
<i>Gabrielle Solis knew for certain.</i>

00:38.750 --> 00:41.000
<i>She knew red was her color.</i>

00:43.208 --> 00:46.542
<i>She knew diamonds went with everything.</i>

00:46.625 --> 00:50.041
<i>And she knew men were all the same.</i>

00:53.208 --> 00:57.709
<i>But the one thing Gabrielle knew</i>
<i>above all else,</i>

00:59.208 --> 01:01.542
<i>she would never want children.</i>

01:05.208 --> 01:07.959
<i>Unfortunately for Gabrielle,</i>

01:08.041 --> 01:11.709
<i>her husband Carlos felt differently.</i>

01:26.417 --> 01:28.792
I'm so lucky to have you.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.625
OK, I'll bite.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.834
Why are you so lucky?

01:34.917 --> 01:36.417
Because...

01:37.750 --> 01:40.000
I don't want to have kids and you do.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.000
Oh, that.

01:42.083 --> 01:46.208
Most men would leave
over something like that.

01:46.291 --> 01:49.166
And you're still here.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.709
I'm grateful.
I know the sacrifice you're making.

01:52.792 --> 01:56.166
There's still a part of me
that's hoping to change your mind.

01:56.250 --> 02:00.834
Once you had a baby, I think
you would love it so much that...

02:00.917 --> 02:03.959
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

02:04.083 --> 02:08.041
- You never know.
- No, sometimes you do.

02:08.125 --> 02:10.875
Well, it is a sacrifice.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.291
But you're worth it.

02:20.208 --> 02:26.041
<i>Yes, Gabrielle Solis knew without a</i>
<i>doubt she didn't want to be a mother.</i>

02:26.125 --> 02:28.041
<i>But what she couldn't know was</i>

02:28.125 --> 02:31.417
<i>just how much</i>
<i>her husband wanted to be a father,</i>

02:31.500 --> 02:36.709
<i>or that he'd been tampering</i>
<i>with her birth control for months.</i>

02:38.709 --> 02:42.041
<i>Or that within one week's time,</i>

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
<i>she'd be pregnant.</i>

03:31.417 --> 03:37.166
<i>Saturdays on Wisteria Lane</i>
<i>belong to the children.</i>

03:37.250 --> 03:42.166
<i>And while most would spend the day</i>
<i>practicing their sports,</i>

03:42.250 --> 03:44.959
<i>and riding their bikes,</i>

03:47.333 --> 03:49.291
<i>and jumping their ropes,</i>

03:49.375 --> 03:52.959
<i>others </i>were <i>no longer</i>
<i>engaged in child's play.</i>

03:53.041 --> 03:57.959
<i>Indeed, some children were being forced</i>
<i>to grow up very quickly.</i>

03:58.041 --> 04:00.792
Sorry to bother you.
We have a few questions for you.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.709
About what?

04:02.792 --> 04:07.792
Twelve years ago, your late wife
purchased a toy chest.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.583
Toy chest?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.542
Yeah, it was about this big,
had little dancing bears on it.

04:14.625 --> 04:18.041
Gosh, I'm sorry.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.750
The craftsman who makes these chests
keeps a list of customers.

04:21.834 --> 04:25.166
Apparently,
you purchased one in August 1992.

04:25.250 --> 04:29.041
We'd like to know
where that chest is now.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.625
Wow, I wish I could help you.

04:31.709 --> 04:33.917
I don't recall any toy chest.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I remember.

04:36.083 --> 04:38.500
It had little bears
and balloons on it, right?

04:38.583 --> 04:40.709
Yes, son, that's right.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.542
We threw it away when I was little.

04:42.625 --> 04:45.083
I was standing on it and it busted.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.959
- Remember, Dad?
- Vaguely.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.000
I guess that's all, then.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.875
Thank you both for your time.

04:56.959 --> 05:00.208
Hey. What's the deal
with this chest, anyway?

05:00.291 --> 05:03.375
One just like you had
washed up on Torch Lake.

05:03.458 --> 05:06.125
- It had a woman in it.
- A woman?

05:08.959 --> 05:11.458
She was all chopped up.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.083
Obviously, we need to talk.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.250
You lied to me.
You said it was a man in the box.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.583
I didn't lie.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.834
The policeman said it was
a woman's body. You were lying.

05:36.917 --> 05:39.250
I told you a detective came
to take you away.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.417
I never said it was a man.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.500
- You didn't?
- No.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.417
- I thought that...
- No.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.542
Stop. Please stop.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.709
I know you're lying to me, OK?
I know that you're lying.

05:51.792 --> 05:55.000
For the last time, someone came
and tried to take you away...

05:55.083 --> 05:56.875
Yes, a woman.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.750
- A woman came.
- Yes, she tried to steal you.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.750
From the only family
that you'd ever really known.

06:02.834 --> 06:06.625
And we couldn't let that happen.
And we didn't.

06:06.709 --> 06:10.959
And that is the truth.

06:17.125 --> 06:19.458
We can't cancel now.
It's two days away.

06:19.542 --> 06:21.625
I'm not going.
That's all there is to it.

06:21.709 --> 06:24.542
Counseling is part of the treatment
at Camp Hennessy.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.792
Nowhere in that brochure
did it say we're expected to attend.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.125
What'll Andrew think
if you don't show up?

06:30.208 --> 06:34.208
I'm making him this care package.
He'll know that I'm thinking about him.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.959
Why are you putting in lemon squares?
They told us not to send him sweets.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.542
I don't understand why.

06:39.625 --> 06:43.458
I guess they feel baked goods from Mom
undercut the boot-camp experience.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.625
Fine, I won't send them.
But I think it's a stupid rule.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.500
Are you going to this thing or not?

06:48.583 --> 06:49.709
- No
- Why?

06:49.792 --> 06:52.542
Because the minute I get there,
Andrew will start

06:52.625 --> 06:55.375
attacking me for abandoning him.

06:55.458 --> 06:59.000
- And I don't want to hear it.
- There's no reason to feel guilty.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.166
You did everything you could for him.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.250
I don't feel guilty.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.542
OK.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.166
Please, Christy.

07:23.250 --> 07:28.083
There's no way I can get another
babysitter this late in the day.

07:28.166 --> 07:30.667
- Parker, knock it off.
- No.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.000
Because I'm having drinks
with friends I used to work with.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.500
They never call
and if I blow them off,

07:36.583 --> 07:38.667
that's it, I'm dead to them.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.166
No, I can't call Patty Binks.

07:43.959 --> 07:47.291
Because she steals things.
Damn it, Christy, you're 13.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.333
You got a lot of trips to the mall
ahead of you.

07:50.417 --> 07:55.709
OK, I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I'm calm.

07:55.792 --> 07:58.417
So I'm starting to think
that this is about money.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.291
So what is it that will make it
worth your while?

08:01.375 --> 08:05.291
A hundred. That's extortion.
There's no way in hell that I'm gonna...

08:05.375 --> 08:06.959
Hello?

08:10.166 --> 08:13.917
Parker, I swear I will spank you.
Knock it off.

08:15.834 --> 08:19.959
Hi, Mrs. Binks.
Is Patty there? Thank you.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.875
Hi, honey. I'm back.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.625
Hey, sweetie.

08:27.709 --> 08:30.583
This is Mr. Steinberg,
the attorney from the hospital.

08:30.667 --> 08:34.333
- Have we met?
- Yes, Mrs. Solis. We've met.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.291
Don't you remember?

08:36.375 --> 08:38.417
It was after Mama died.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.709
Apparently the hospital was negligent

08:40.792 --> 08:43.625
and agreed to
a seven-figure settlement check.

08:43.709 --> 08:46.583
A check I was never told about.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.667
Oh, that.

08:54.583 --> 08:58.000
- Mr. Steinberg...
- I was just leaving.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.917
- What were you thinking?
- Let me explain.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.834
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't make the right decision.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.709
The right decision
was to use that money for my lawyers,

09:18.792 --> 09:22.041
to fight the indictment
instead of taking the plea bargain.

09:22.125 --> 09:24.875
The government would have
seized the settlement.

09:24.959 --> 09:28.959
- We could have fought that in court.
- And you would have blown the money.

09:29.041 --> 09:32.542
Who cares? If there was a chance
I didn't have to go to jail?

09:32.625 --> 09:36.041
You had Laotian convicts sewing
casual wear for two cents an hour.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.625
Don't you think you deserve a time-out?

09:38.709 --> 09:42.750
Eight months. Thanks to you,
I'm going away for eight months.

09:42.834 --> 09:46.959
When you get out, we'll have money
to start over with. Thanks to me.

09:50.583 --> 09:55.125
You know, once you calm down, you're
gonna realize I did the right thing.

09:55.208 --> 09:58.667
And when that happens,
I'd appreciate an apology.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.375
Grandma's here.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.000
Now that is just perfect.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.542
Stay put.

10:32.542 --> 10:36.250
- I am so sorry.
- Hey, Mom.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.166
Hey, Susie.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.542
- I goofed.
- What happened?

10:41.625 --> 10:45.375
You know me.
No depth perception whatsoever.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.834
I'm stunned
they even issued me a license.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.208
So, you're Susan's mom.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.375
Yeah.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.208
I'm Sophie Bremmer. And you are?

10:54.291 --> 10:55.667
Mike Delfino.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.458
You're Mike? Oh, my God.

11:00.542 --> 11:03.208
Susan's told me so much about you.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.500
Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a hug.

11:10.375 --> 11:14.583
Mom. Mike and I aren't
together anymore.

11:17.875 --> 11:22.625
Sorry. I guess I just made this
pretty awkward, huh?

11:22.709 --> 11:25.166
Yeah, you really did.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.583
So let's just call
the insurance company.

11:27.667 --> 11:28.959
OK.

11:29.041 --> 11:32.417
Well... It's nice
meeting you anyway, Mike.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.917
You too. I never would've guessed
you were Susan's mom.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.750
I know. I look too young.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.375
I got pregnant
when I was a tiny teenager.

11:41.458 --> 11:44.417
- OK...
- The first time I got drunk, ever.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.208
- Can you believe it?
- Let's go.

11:46.291 --> 11:50.834
Her father was a marine. Afterwards,
he gave me three of his medals.

11:50.917 --> 11:53.500
- Mom.
- What?

11:53.583 --> 11:56.291
Let's go inside
and call the insurance company.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.000
Right.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.959
What are you smiling about?

12:09.041 --> 12:14.291
I used to have all these questions
about how you got to be the way you are.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.333
They were all just answered.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.458
Hi.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.917
What's going on?

12:48.750 --> 12:53.000
- My babysitter cancelled.
- Lynette, I'm so swamped today.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.041
My house is a mess and
I've got millions of errands to run.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.333
Please hear me out. This is important.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.959
Today, I have a chance to rejoin
the human race for a few hours.

13:02.041 --> 13:05.000
There are actual adults
waiting for me with margaritas.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.250
Look, I'm in a dress. I have make-up on.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.583
- If it were any other day.
- Bree, I'm wearing pantyhose.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.542
- Bring them in.
- Thank you.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.125
OK, in you go.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.333
Then the police showed me his mug shot.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.917
- No.
- Yes.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.250
Mike served time
for selling drugs and manslaughter.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.208
- I can't believe it.
- Well, it's true.

13:29.291 --> 13:33.208
- He has such nice manners.
- I know.

13:33.291 --> 13:39.208
Susie, I don't want you worrying
too much about this Mike thing.

13:39.291 --> 13:44.375
The right man will come along.
Just give it time.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.583
I would have given up entirely
if it weren't for you and Morty.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.041
- Morty?
- Yeah, you know.

13:51.125 --> 13:55.959
It's the third time around for
both of you and you're really clicking.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.041
It gives me hope.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.792
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.125
I'm just... I'm tired.

14:06.208 --> 14:09.625
You're not tired. You took a nap.
What is it?

14:11.375 --> 14:15.291
- I left Morty.
- What? Why?

14:15.375 --> 14:17.291
Because he shoved me.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.250
Morty? No.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.083
You think I'm lying? Fine.

14:22.166 --> 14:25.083
- Why would he shove you?
- I confronted him.

14:25.166 --> 14:29.000
About how much time he's spending
at that damned pancake restaurant.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.083
If that's where he's really been.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.375
You can't be serious. Morty?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.959
You think men his age don't have needs?

14:36.041 --> 14:38.125
You should see the waitresses he hires.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.792
Every year,
they get younger and younger.

14:40.875 --> 14:44.583
Maybe you feel that way because
every year you get older and older.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.125
- That's a horrible thing to say.
- I'm sorry.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.625
- I'm not that old.
- I said I was sorry.

14:49.709 --> 14:54.166
- People think we're sisters.
- That's 'cause you tell them that.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.542
One time. You've gotta let go of that.

14:57.625 --> 15:02.583
OK, look. I am just saying that
I don't think Morty cheated on you.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.792
Well, he did shove me.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.458
And the least you can do
is be supportive.

15:07.542 --> 15:10.583
You're right.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.625
- He also threw a book at me.
- Come on.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.667
I mean, he shouldn't have done that.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.417
Thank you.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.667
Porter, honey, those cookies are hot.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.458
Wait a few minutes
and I'll give you one, OK?

15:42.959 --> 15:46.709
You know, pictures are prettier
if you color inside the lines.

15:50.709 --> 15:53.458
Well, art is subjective.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.625
- Porter. What did I tell you?
- But I'm hungry.

15:58.709 --> 16:03.542
Then I will fix you a very nice bowl
of peaches and cottage cheese.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.500
- Barf.
- Don't be common, young man.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.375
Come on. If you play
with those cookies one more time,

16:09.458 --> 16:11.083
I'm gonna have to spank you.

16:11.166 --> 16:14.125
- We don't get spanked.
- Really?

16:14.208 --> 16:17.208
Mommy always says she's gonna
but she never does.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.250
Well, I am not your mommy.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.709
And if you misbehave in my house,

16:21.792 --> 16:23.875
you will get spanked.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.959
So be good.

16:43.667 --> 16:47.250
- It was an accident.
- Porter, I warned you.

16:47.333 --> 16:48.792
I'll be good.

16:48.875 --> 16:53.291
Those cookies were made from scratch.

16:53.375 --> 16:56.083
Your fate is sealed.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.834
Come here.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.458
No.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.542
What's that?

17:08.625 --> 17:11.417
It's called a post-nuptial agreement.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.750
- It's a legal document...
- I know what a post-nup is.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.792
What is it doing on my coffee table?

17:17.875 --> 17:21.458
I can forgive that stunt you pulled
with the settlement check,

17:21.542 --> 17:24.875
if I'm sure you'll really
be around when I get out of jail.

17:27.125 --> 17:30.792
And the post-nup changes
the terms of the pre-nup, so...

17:30.875 --> 17:34.792
So if you try and divorce me
while I'm gone,

17:34.875 --> 17:36.959
you get nothing.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.834
You don't trust me?

17:38.917 --> 17:41.458
- Afraid not.
- Well, that's too bad.

17:41.542 --> 17:44.000
Because I'm not signing
that piece of paper.

17:44.083 --> 17:47.375
You're a very beautiful woman,
Gabrielle.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.667
But you're not very bright.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.041
If you don't sign it,

17:55.125 --> 17:59.291
I'll pull the plug on
the settlement agreement, divorce you,

17:59.375 --> 18:04.458
and then you get what amounts to
about 50% of our current savings,

18:04.542 --> 18:07.083
which is basically nothing.

18:09.083 --> 18:12.333
So what do you expect to happen
right now, Carlos?

18:12.417 --> 18:16.000
I'll sign the paper
and jump right back into your arms?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.750
It doesn't mean that I don't love you.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.417
You know I think
you're the perfect woman.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.834
But I'm not. I have flaws.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.750
Flaws?

18:33.834 --> 18:35.834
I'll give you an example.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.208
Remember the time when you were in jail

18:38.291 --> 18:40.834
and you told me
about your secret compartment

18:40.917 --> 18:44.291
and you told me to burn
the papers that I found in there?

18:44.375 --> 18:48.000
Well, me being pretty
and therefore stupid,

18:48.083 --> 18:50.166
I forgot.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.125
You didn't burn the papers.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.583
Worse. I read them.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.375
- OK...
- You have a nerve talking about trust

18:58.458 --> 19:01.041
with a secret bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

19:01.125 --> 19:04.542
- That was a safety net for both of us.
- I'll bet.

19:04.625 --> 19:07.875
- Have you told anyone about this?
- No, but I could.

19:07.959 --> 19:11.417
Isn't that why the prosecution
didn't have a case against you?

19:11.500 --> 19:13.792
They couldn't find the profits you made.

19:13.875 --> 19:17.709
So if I were you,
I wouldn't mention the words divorce,

19:17.792 --> 19:21.208
trust, or post-nup ever again.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.834
You don't wanna piss me off.

19:32.041 --> 19:35.542
I know, baby. It hurts to lose.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.250
Ante up.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.625
Well, look at me.

19:46.709 --> 19:50.542
Finally in on one of your legendary
poker parties.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.333
Susan's always telling me
how much fun you have.

19:53.417 --> 19:57.250
The rules are simple. We play for cash,
the dealer picks the game,

19:57.333 --> 20:00.500
and unsubstantiated gossip
is encouraged.

20:00.583 --> 20:04.500
Bree, thanks again for watching my boys.
They weren't too much to handle?

20:04.583 --> 20:08.542
We had a wonderful time. Although
I think Porter had a little less fun.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.333
OK, I'll bet.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.917
So, Sophie, Susan says
you're going to the spa tomorrow.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.125
- Is it an all-day thing?
- What do you mean, Porter had less fun?

20:17.208 --> 20:20.375
- I'll raise.
- He misbehaved, so I had to punish him.

20:20.458 --> 20:24.125
Yes, Susan is treating me
to an entire day of...

20:24.208 --> 20:27.333
When you say punishment,
what exactly are we talking about?

20:27.417 --> 20:29.458
I had to spank him.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.792
OK, I will re-raise.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.542
You spanked my son?

20:38.291 --> 20:42.166
Las Brisas Spa.
Yup, that's where we're going.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.834
Lynette, is there a problem?

20:46.917 --> 20:49.500
Tom and I don't believe
in hitting our kids.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.750
Sorry, I didn't know.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.083
It won't happen again.

20:56.083 --> 20:59.000
Of course, I'm somewhat
surprised you don't spank them.

20:59.083 --> 21:03.041
Everybody knows they're a little bit
out of control.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.333
Wow, I am dragging today.
Shall we put on another pot of coffee?

21:08.417 --> 21:10.417
Yeah, I'll do it.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.667
I'll fold.

21:14.750 --> 21:18.500
Yeah, you're right, Bree.
I've got a lot to learn about parenting.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.959
I feel so blessed
to be getting sage advice

21:21.041 --> 21:23.000
from an impeccable mother like you.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.250
Your kids turned out perfect,
if you don't count Andrew.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.458
Where is he, again?

21:28.542 --> 21:32.125
Some kind of a boot camp
for juvenile delinquents?

21:32.208 --> 21:34.208
OK, girls.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.125
I never said I was perfect.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.709
- Honey, nobody's blaming you.
- The hell I'm not.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.458
Lynette.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.583
If you will excuse me.

21:53.458 --> 21:57.083
- Lynette, will you go after her?
- She spanked my son.

21:57.166 --> 21:59.375
I'm not apologizing.

22:04.208 --> 22:07.291
Usually, poker is more fun than this.

22:08.458 --> 22:12.250
So help me, if you don't back me up
on this, I will lose it.

22:12.333 --> 22:16.750
Yes, Bree shouldn't have spanked Porter.
But it's not like she hurt him.

22:16.834 --> 22:20.333
That is not the point. You don't spank
other people's children.

22:20.417 --> 22:23.333
He was misbehaving.
She had to do something.

22:23.417 --> 22:27.125
But make no mistake,
she definitely crossed the line.

22:27.208 --> 22:30.709
Damn right. She could've tried
something else, like a time-out,

22:30.792 --> 22:33.542
or she could've simply
threatened to spank him.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.959
Yeah, 'cause that works out
so well when we do it.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.834
It does work.
It does work most of the time.

22:39.917 --> 22:44.834
It used to work. They've figured out
it's an empty threat. They're onto us.

22:46.291 --> 22:49.375
My mom used to beat the hell
out of my sisters and me,

22:49.458 --> 22:51.166
and I won't do it.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.959
I will not become my mother.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.333
Fine.

23:01.417 --> 23:04.500
But the boys
are getting older and smarter.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.250
And eventually, believe me,

23:06.333 --> 23:09.458
they'll figure out
that they outnumber us and then...

23:09.542 --> 23:11.208
We're screwed.

23:12.208 --> 23:14.208
Exactly.

23:28.583 --> 23:32.792
Excuse me, Zachary. Would you mind
helping me with these bags?

23:32.875 --> 23:37.000
There's some banana bread
in it for you if you do.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.750
Yeah, sure.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.500
This is really good. Thanks a lot.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.500
You're welcome, Zachary.

23:45.583 --> 23:48.000
I've never been
in Mrs. Huber's house before.

23:48.083 --> 23:51.166
Obviously you haven't missed much.

23:51.250 --> 23:55.583
This is the place
where good taste goes to die.

23:58.875 --> 24:02.834
So, I heard you and your father
arguing the other day.

24:02.917 --> 24:05.333
- Everything all right at home?
- Yeah.

24:05.417 --> 24:07.959
We just have problems, sometimes.

24:09.375 --> 24:12.333
I bet you miss your mother.

24:12.417 --> 24:17.250
I'm sure things were different
when she was alive.

24:17.333 --> 24:20.291
Such a warm, loving woman.

24:23.333 --> 24:27.625
You knew my mother?

24:27.709 --> 24:31.917
Yup. Years ago, in Utah.
We worked together.

24:33.333 --> 24:36.917
- I didn't know that.
- It's true.

24:37.875 --> 24:43.625
In fact, I'll tell you a secret.

24:43.709 --> 24:47.125
I once met you
when you were a little baby.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.625
Really?

24:53.625 --> 24:57.959
Your mother loved you so much, Zachary.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.500
Of all the things I remember,

25:03.333 --> 25:06.458
I remember that the most.

25:16.792 --> 25:20.000
You wanna know what else I remember?

25:22.667 --> 25:26.375
How lovely your original name was.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.458
Dana?

25:46.875 --> 25:49.458
Isn't this nice?

25:49.542 --> 25:52.083
Just the two of us girls hanging out,

25:52.166 --> 25:54.125
getting pretty.

25:54.208 --> 25:58.333
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

25:58.417 --> 26:02.834
So, I was thinking
maybe you should call Morty.

26:02.917 --> 26:05.542
You know, get started
working things out?

26:08.083 --> 26:11.834
Why work things out
with a man who abuses me?

26:11.917 --> 26:14.875
You don't have to gasp.
My mother exaggerates.

26:14.959 --> 26:17.291
She won't be happy till I have bruises.

26:17.375 --> 26:20.291
Can we just focus?
What I want to know is,

26:20.375 --> 26:25.125
have you thought about what's going to
happen if you don't go back to Morty?

26:25.208 --> 26:27.000
What do you mean?

26:27.083 --> 26:30.709
Well, you don't have a place to live,
you don't like to work,

26:30.792 --> 26:34.208
you didn't want to marry Morty
so he doesn't have to pay you alimony.

26:34.291 --> 26:39.792
If you don't go back to this man who
allegedly shoved you once in five years,

26:39.875 --> 26:42.500
what are your options?

26:42.583 --> 26:44.417
I thought I could live with you.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.834
What?

26:45.917 --> 26:48.417
Oh, God. Are you all right?

26:48.500 --> 26:50.750
- Get away.
- I'm so sorry. I was startled.

26:50.834 --> 26:52.333
Here, lean your head back.

26:52.417 --> 26:55.208
I'm not saying permanently,
just a couple of years.

26:55.291 --> 26:58.500
- You broke my nose.
- No, it's just banged a little.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.667
- Till I get back on my feet.
- Can we talk about this later?

27:01.750 --> 27:05.291
- Should we call 911?
- It's just a nosebleed. She's fine.

27:05.375 --> 27:09.041
- I thought you'd be excited.
- It's not that I'm not excited.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.208
I'm not stupid, Susan.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.917
It's obvious you don't want me here.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.917
No, that's not true. Mom, don't go.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.208
Mom, come back.

27:20.291 --> 27:21.583
I need to...

27:22.458 --> 27:24.458
- We're good, right?
- Just go.

28:13.625 --> 28:16.291
Why aren't you dressed yet?

28:16.375 --> 28:20.959
I wanted to wear Andrew's favorite color
and then I realized that

28:22.083 --> 28:24.792
I don't know what it is.

28:24.875 --> 28:29.125
Honey, I think the fact you decided
to come at all will make him happy.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.291
Yours is blue.

28:31.375 --> 28:34.083
Danielle loves pink.

28:34.166 --> 28:38.291
And I have no idea
what my own son's favorite color is.

28:38.375 --> 28:41.583
- I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.
- How can you say that?

28:41.667 --> 28:43.291
Of course it matters.

28:43.375 --> 28:47.125
That is a good mother. Someone
who knows their child inside and out

28:47.208 --> 28:51.041
so that if they get in trouble,
they know what to do.

28:53.959 --> 28:56.166
I don't know him well enough.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.500
You are a good mother.

29:07.792 --> 29:12.333
Brown or green? I just don't know.

29:15.792 --> 29:18.500
I'm gonna wait in the car.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.750
Whenever you're ready.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.500
Green.

29:29.583 --> 29:33.375
I'll go with the green.
Everybody loves green.

29:54.458 --> 29:59.041
- I told you. I'm not signing this.
- I think you are.

29:59.125 --> 30:02.750
Because if you don't,
I will divorce you.

30:04.959 --> 30:07.709
Then I'll go to the police.

30:07.792 --> 30:10.041
And tell them what?

30:10.125 --> 30:15.458
There's a secret bank account in the
Cayman Islands that no longer exists?

30:15.542 --> 30:18.125
- You moved the money?
- Of course I moved the money.

30:21.667 --> 30:25.041
That was risky. I mean,
the Feds are watching you right now.

30:25.125 --> 30:28.542
I had to do something.

30:28.625 --> 30:33.333
I couldn't just let you
make a fool out of me.

30:40.125 --> 30:43.583
- Carlos, stop it. Put me down.
- OK.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.166
Put me down.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.583
Let me go.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.792
Stop. You're hurting me, Carlos.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.834
Sign it.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.166
Sign it.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.333
I know, baby.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.041
It hurts to lose.

31:46.166 --> 31:48.417
Mr. and Mrs. Van De Kamp?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.709
Yes. Is it our turn?

31:50.792 --> 31:54.709
Well, sort of.
Andrew's waiting inside but...

31:54.834 --> 31:55.917
What's wrong?

31:55.959 --> 32:01.000
He said he won't go forward with
the session if his mother's involved.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.625
He only wants to talk to his dad.

32:03.709 --> 32:07.041
We drove 200 miles to be here today.
This is unacceptable.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.625
Yeah, I share your frustration.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.583
To hell with him, then.
We're going home.

32:12.667 --> 32:15.125
- No.
- I'm not gonna let him insult you.

32:15.208 --> 32:19.041
He blames me for his being here.
He blames me for everything.

32:20.166 --> 32:24.083
- And he's probably right.
- Any mistakes were made by both of us.

32:25.250 --> 32:28.125
One of us should go talk to him,
see how he is.

32:28.208 --> 32:30.417
I'm OK.

32:30.500 --> 32:34.291
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.625
Right this way.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.542
Mom.

33:09.625 --> 33:13.125
I'm coming. What is it?
Why aren't you brushing your teeth?

33:15.625 --> 33:18.375
- What happened?
- Porter pushed me and it fell in.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.917
- He pushed me first.
- Can I flush it?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.458
No, I'll fish it out later.

33:23.542 --> 33:28.000
You're off the hook tonight
but not you two, so start brushing.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.333
Preston, did you not hear me?
I said start brushing your teeth.

33:33.417 --> 33:35.917
What are you doing?

33:36.709 --> 33:39.583
Don't you dare.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.250
Do it.

33:41.333 --> 33:45.291
Don't listen to them. Back away
from the toilet and no one gets hurt.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.750
Do it.

33:46.834 --> 33:49.542
I mean it this time.
These are not just words.

33:51.458 --> 33:54.583
If you do this, so help me...

33:54.667 --> 33:57.667
<i>Hearing the hollowness of her own voice,</i>

33:57.750 --> 34:01.709
<i>Lynette realized that it was time</i>
<i>to get one step ahead.</i>

34:03.875 --> 34:06.208
I will walk you over
to Mrs. Van De Kamp's

34:06.291 --> 34:09.458
and we all know what happens
when she gets mad.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.333
Now...

34:14.208 --> 34:16.792
Go brush your teeth.
I want 'em to sparkle. Go on.

34:20.375 --> 34:24.291
Sorry you had to bring your kid back.
What happened this time?

34:24.375 --> 34:27.709
A couple of months back,
I caught Tug going through my purse.

34:27.792 --> 34:30.834
I hate when they do that.

34:30.917 --> 34:35.125
- Was he looking for weed or money?
- Who knows at this point?

34:35.208 --> 34:39.291
Anyway, I'd knocked a couple back
and things got heated.

34:39.375 --> 34:43.166
Pretty soon we're both screaming,
throwing stuff round the apartment.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.542
Next thing,
lady upstairs calls the cops.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.750
Gimme a break.

34:51.291 --> 34:56.959
So, now I got some social worker
telling me how to raise my boy.

34:57.041 --> 35:00.041
Kids. Boy, if I knew then
what I know now,

35:00.125 --> 35:04.542
I would've had that hysterectomy
20 years ago.

35:14.583 --> 35:17.208
- Bree...
- Don't get up. I'll be quick.

35:17.291 --> 35:23.083
All any parent can do is provide their
child with the tools to succeed in life.

35:23.166 --> 35:26.375
Education, love,
a good clean, safe home.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.542
I've given you those things
and I'm through feeling guilty.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.959
If you wanna piss your life away
and blame it on

35:32.041 --> 35:34.250
how horrible things are at home,
go ahead.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.792
I want it stated for the record
that I'm a good mother. Do you hear me?

35:37.875 --> 35:40.125
I am a good mother.

35:42.583 --> 35:44.208
Bree...

35:45.625 --> 35:49.333
Andrew just told me
he thinks he might be gay.

35:51.208 --> 35:52.458
What?

35:52.542 --> 35:55.208
That's why he wanted me
to come in first.

35:55.291 --> 35:58.250
He thought I could take it better.

36:04.083 --> 36:07.125
Well, he was right.
I will be waiting in the car.

36:16.125 --> 36:19.000
Mrs. Solis. What are you doing here?

36:23.500 --> 36:25.709
- OK.
- Are your roommates here?

36:25.792 --> 36:27.291
No.

36:27.375 --> 36:30.000
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.542
- What's this?
- That?

36:33.625 --> 36:37.000
Carlos just got a little rough.
Made me sign some papers.

36:37.083 --> 36:39.083
He hurt you?

36:42.041 --> 36:44.542
- What are you doing?
- I'll take care of this.

36:44.625 --> 36:47.458
- Don't do anything.
- We can't let him get away with it.

36:47.542 --> 36:50.458
Look, if you really wanna
get back at him, then kiss me.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.542
- How's that gonna help?
- Because...

36:52.625 --> 36:54.709
one day when the time is right,

36:54.792 --> 36:57.792
I'm gonna tell him
how he drove me right into your arms.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.875
And that's gonna kill him.

37:04.125 --> 37:08.458
And tonight, whatever you do,
don't call me beautiful.

37:21.959 --> 37:24.041
Morty, look who's here.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.625
Hey, Millie. Hi, Morty.

37:26.709 --> 37:29.208
Susie, what brings you here?

37:29.291 --> 37:31.917
Mom. I brought her over.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.542
What's she doing out there?

37:36.625 --> 37:39.500
She says she won't come in
until you apologize to her.

37:39.583 --> 37:42.834
- For what?
- For shoving her.

37:42.917 --> 37:46.667
I only shoved her
because she wouldn't stop hitting me.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.750
Why was she hitting you?

37:48.834 --> 37:51.000
I threw a book at her.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.250
- Morty.
- It was a paperback.

37:53.333 --> 37:56.917
- Well, even so.
- At least I missed.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.917
She hit me square in the gut.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.417
- Wanna see the bruise?
- That's OK.

38:04.750 --> 38:08.250
- It really hurt.
- Yeah, I understand.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.250
So...

38:11.291 --> 38:14.041
Could you just go out and apologize?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.792
- No.
- Why?

38:15.875 --> 38:18.875
- 'Cause I don't want her back.
- Morty.

38:18.959 --> 38:24.208
Look, I love her, but the Pancake Shack
is just starting to take off.

38:24.291 --> 38:28.375
We're talking about opening another one.
That's practically a chain.

38:29.542 --> 38:32.125
I don't have time for her hysterics.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.542
I sympathize, I really do.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.917
- But you have to take her back.
- Why?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.417
Because she wants to move in with me.

38:41.917 --> 38:45.667
I'd like to have a relationship again,
and at my age, with a kid,

38:45.750 --> 38:49.041
if she moves into my house,
even for a couple of years, I'm doomed.

38:49.125 --> 38:52.917
Wasn't there a plumber? Your mother
said you were in love with a plumber.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.792
I am. I mean, I was.

38:55.875 --> 38:59.500
- It didn't work out.
- I'm sorry.

38:59.583 --> 39:03.417
If she moves in, she will burn up
all my oxygen and I need it.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.000
Please, can't you give her
another chance?

39:07.083 --> 39:09.625
You guys are really good together,
you know?

39:09.709 --> 39:12.750
When there's no violence.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.166
Well, we do have chemistry.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.583
Absolutely.

39:16.667 --> 39:20.333
And the sex was like... Wow.

39:20.417 --> 39:24.417
There was this one time,
we were coming home on the interstate...

39:24.500 --> 39:27.709
You don't have to sell me.
Just go talk to her.

39:28.709 --> 39:30.375
Now.

39:33.542 --> 39:35.417
OK.

39:44.959 --> 39:47.375
That was a mighty big sigh.

39:47.458 --> 39:50.500
I just keep thinking it's coming,
and I can't stop it.

39:50.583 --> 39:51.709
What's that?

39:51.792 --> 39:55.166
The day my mother will need
to move in and I won't have a choice.

39:55.250 --> 40:00.417
I know it's years away.
She's youthful and vibrant, thank God.

40:00.500 --> 40:05.125
But time flies. One day she won't be
able to take care of herself anymore.

40:05.208 --> 40:08.709
- And I'll have to step up.
- I suppose that's true.

40:09.792 --> 40:11.667
I think it's nature's little joke,

40:11.750 --> 40:16.041
that children ultimately
end up parenting their parents.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.500
Well, when that day comes,
I'll be ready.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.959
Honey, you'd better get out there.

40:21.041 --> 40:23.083
Stop it.

40:28.041 --> 40:29.709
What are you doing?

40:29.792 --> 40:33.250
Porter says he can't catch me.

40:59.792 --> 41:00.792
Hey.

41:04.792 --> 41:07.542
Look, I just wanted to apologize...

41:07.625 --> 41:09.333
Lynette, don't.

41:11.542 --> 41:15.291
The fact that you just crossed
that street means the world to me.

41:15.375 --> 41:18.083
And if anyone here should apologize,
it's me.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.208
Thank you.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.709
Looks like Tom's
got the mob under control.

41:28.792 --> 41:33.291
Wanna have some coffee,
sit around, bitch about our kids...?

41:34.792 --> 41:36.792
- I would love to.
- OK.

41:43.375 --> 41:47.583
<i>Children come into the world</i>
<i>with their own agendas.</i>

41:47.667 --> 41:50.667
<i>Some to brighten our days.</i>

41:52.667 --> 41:56.542
<i>Some to test our patience.</i>

41:59.667 --> 42:03.125
<i>Some to give us purpose.</i>

42:07.917 --> 42:10.917
<i>Some to take care of us.</i>

42:14.959 --> 42:18.583
<i>Yes, when they come,</i>

42:18.667 --> 42:21.542
<i>children change everything.</i>

42:29.542 --> 42:32.959
<i>Especially when they're not invited.</i>
